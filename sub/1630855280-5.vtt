WEBVTT

00:05.842 --> 00:07.510
Let's roll the vocals you did earlier.

00:07.594 --> 00:09.596
-Yeah.
-Even though it's not the final, you know.

00:19.731 --> 00:22.526
Tell nobody what I told you

00:22.608 --> 00:25.362
Our secret that I own you

00:25.445 --> 00:28.740
I just wanna hold you

00:28.824 --> 00:33.619
And to feel you, baby,
deep under my skin still

00:33.703 --> 00:38.916
Lasted for a moment,
take it like you own it

00:39.626 --> 00:41.503
Say it

00:41.586 --> 00:47.050
Give me tough love

00:47.134 --> 00:52.639
Leave me with nothin' when I come down

00:52.722 --> 00:58.061
My kinda love

00:58.145 --> 01:03.358
Force me and choke me 'til I pass out

01:03.858 --> 01:06.737
We don't gotta be in love, no

01:06.820 --> 01:09.489
I don't gotta be the one, no

01:09.572 --> 01:15.078
I just wanna be one
of your girls tonight

01:15.162 --> 01:17.789
We don't gotta be in love, no

01:17.873 --> 01:20.541
I don't gotta be the one, no

01:20.625 --> 01:26.213
I just wanna be one
of your girls tonight

01:26.298 --> 01:28.340
Oh-oh-oh, ooh

01:31.887 --> 01:35.264
What if you came in with the same melody
that you do in the second verse?

01:35.348 --> 01:38.435
You know, the song is about you.
Make it about you.

01:38.518 --> 01:39.770
There's just somethin' about

01:39.853 --> 01:41.271
Close out the fuckin' chapter.

01:41.354 --> 01:43.356
-Yeah, getting what you need and being--
-Bye-bye.

01:43.440 --> 01:44.858
satisfied.

01:47.360 --> 01:51.948
One of your girls tonight

02:04.544 --> 02:06.963
Oh-oh-oh, ooh

02:10.592 --> 02:12.803
Joss, so good.

02:12.886 --> 02:15.222
One of your girls tonight

02:16.973 --> 02:20.477
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm

02:22.312 --> 02:26.441
Mm-mm, mm-mm

02:28.777 --> 02:30.153
Push me down, hold me down

02:30.237 --> 02:31.405
Do we have that outro?

02:31.488 --> 02:33.824
We should work on that outro.
'Cause I liked it.

02:33.907 --> 02:36.576
I just need to find a way
to fit it in better.

02:36.660 --> 02:38.912
I usually numb my own pain
when I'm with you

02:38.995 --> 02:41.415
Take me away from it all

02:41.498 --> 02:43.542
Sounds good, bring it back.
I wanna hear that part again.

02:43.625 --> 02:45.794
You know, I think you should go.

02:45.877 --> 02:46.962
You want me to leave?

02:47.045 --> 02:49.631
You're gonna kick out
your only source of inspiration?

02:49.714 --> 02:51.633
Well, you've served your purpose.

02:51.716 --> 02:53.510
I don't think so.

02:53.593 --> 02:55.429
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way.

02:55.512 --> 02:56.972
So you wanna kick me out?

02:57.055 --> 02:59.099
You wanna cut off your lifeline?

02:59.182 --> 03:00.600
You wanna turn the faucet off?

03:00.684 --> 03:03.061
-Tedros!
-You wanna kill the soul in the room?

03:03.145 --> 03:04.646
I'm done with you.

03:04.729 --> 03:07.399
The song's about me.
Without me, no song.

03:07.858 --> 03:09.943
-It's actually about me.
-Oh, is it?

03:10.026 --> 03:12.195
-Yeah.
-Oh, it's a self-portrait now?

03:12.279 --> 03:13.947
You're just singin' about yourself
in this song?

03:14.030 --> 03:15.699
-Is that what you're saying?
-I'm singing about my experiences,

03:15.782 --> 03:17.451
my feelings, and what I've been through
and it's about me.

03:17.534 --> 03:19.828
Really? Yeah. Your feelings?
Yeah, right.

03:20.537 --> 03:22.289
Yeah, right.

03:22.372 --> 03:25.959
Mike, did I ever tell you about
how I first met this guy?

03:26.042 --> 03:27.502
-Sage, did I tell you this story?
-No.

03:27.586 --> 03:32.174
It's so funny. He knew this
random backup dancer of mine

03:32.257 --> 03:34.009
and he saw that I followed her
on Instagram

03:34.092 --> 03:35.927
and he'd been, like,
obsessed with me for years,

03:36.011 --> 03:37.471
like back when he was in prison and stuff,

03:37.554 --> 03:41.433
and he had her, like,
bring me to his club.

03:41.516 --> 03:43.185
And then he pointed me out
on the dance floor

03:43.268 --> 03:44.728
and he's like, "Is that Jocelyn?

03:44.811 --> 03:46.229
-That's not true.
-"Oh, my God. You're here." It is true.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.814
That's not fucking true.

03:47.898 --> 03:49.941
And we were dancing and stuff
and then when we started talking,

03:50.025 --> 03:52.819
he was talking about "When Doves Cry,"
and Prince, and everything,

03:52.903 --> 03:53.987
'cause she must've told him that I had

03:54.071 --> 03:56.364
this, like, huge poster
of Prince upstairs.

03:56.448 --> 03:57.908
I'm the one that pointed that out.

03:57.991 --> 03:59.826
I'm the one that pointed out
the coincidence.

03:59.910 --> 04:01.703
You're a fucking con man and a fraud.

04:01.787 --> 04:03.997
-Ooh, shit.
-Oh, really?

04:04.081 --> 04:06.333
Yeah, and it was this whole fuckin' setup.

04:06.416 --> 04:08.752
This whole time,
he had this crazy fucking plan,

04:08.835 --> 04:10.212
-and it worked, ya know?
-Fuck you, Jocelyn.

04:10.295 --> 04:12.339
-It worked.
-That's some super LA shit.

04:12.422 --> 04:13.632
Fuck you, Mike.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.717
Fuckin' vampire.

04:15.801 --> 04:16.635
It's bullshit.

04:16.718 --> 04:19.429
Chloe, when did Tedros first bring me up?

04:21.223 --> 04:23.975
I mean,
he's been manifesting this for forever.

04:24.059 --> 04:26.686
What are you-- Chloe, no, that's not true.

04:27.521 --> 04:29.481
What the fuck you-- That's not true.

04:29.564 --> 04:30.774
Not true.

04:34.236 --> 04:35.904
You wanted to find a way into my life?

04:35.987 --> 04:37.989
You wanted me to hear your artists? I did.

04:38.615 --> 04:39.783
I like them.

04:40.700 --> 04:44.121
They can stay.
You, on the other hand, can go.

04:52.129 --> 04:54.756
All right,
we should work on that outro, I think.

04:55.924 --> 05:00.303
Somethin' about the way
that you give me your love

05:00.387 --> 05:01.721
Ohh

05:03.640 --> 05:07.394
Love, give me your love

05:07.477 --> 05:09.354
Ohh

05:11.314 --> 05:12.732
I just wanna sing that chorus again.

05:12.816 --> 05:15.110
I keep going back to the chorus
'cause it's so good.

05:17.696 --> 05:19.865
I'll wait for you here, Joss.

05:42.596 --> 05:44.806
So did she like the song?

05:45.932 --> 05:47.350
She loved it.

05:49.561 --> 05:52.439
Joss, you have to get up.
Finkelstein is on the phone.

05:52.522 --> 05:54.524
-What?
-He's on mute.

05:55.025 --> 05:56.610
-What does he want?
-I don't know.

05:56.693 --> 05:58.528
He just said, "Get her up."

05:58.612 --> 06:00.447
You told him I was sleeping?

06:11.625 --> 06:13.168
Hey. How's it goin'?

06:13.251 --> 06:14.419
Good, good.

06:14.503 --> 06:16.713
But I have some concerns about the tour

06:16.797 --> 06:19.257
and I need to talk to you
about it face-to-face.

06:19.341 --> 06:20.467
So, I'm gonna come by.

06:20.550 --> 06:22.260
I'm just in a little bit
of a meeting right now.

06:22.344 --> 06:23.804
Gonna come by at one o'clock,

06:23.887 --> 06:25.597
and we're gonna have a chat, 'kay?
See ya then.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.683
Great. Can't wait. Bye.

06:44.533 --> 06:48.203
Joss, there's something important
that I need to talk to you about.

06:49.663 --> 06:51.081
Does it have anything to do with the tour?

06:52.541 --> 06:53.458
-No.
-Great.

06:53.542 --> 06:55.669
Nothing else matters to me right now.

07:09.975 --> 07:11.601
All right, listen up!

07:12.602 --> 07:14.104
-Get up. Get up. Get up.
-Come here.

07:14.187 --> 07:15.856
-Wake up!
-Joss.

07:15.939 --> 07:18.817
Guys! Wake up. All right.

07:18.900 --> 07:21.737
My entire team is coming over at 1 P.M.

07:21.820 --> 07:23.238
-What?
-To dis...

07:25.490 --> 07:28.827
-My entire team is coming over at 1 P.M.
-What, you weren't gonna tell me?

07:28.910 --> 07:30.454
To decide whether or not
the tour is moving forward.

07:30.537 --> 07:31.997
-Don't ignore me.
-Alright?

07:32.080 --> 07:33.582
-What they don't know...
-I'm right fuckin' here.

07:33.665 --> 07:35.167
...is I want Ramsey and Chloe...

07:35.250 --> 07:37.544
-Oh, you want?
-...and Izaak-- Where's Izaak?

07:38.336 --> 07:40.505
-He's doing yoga.
-Okay, well, I want Ramsey,

07:40.589 --> 07:42.382
and Chloe, and Izaak to be my opening act.

07:42.466 --> 07:45.302
You want them to be your opening act?
That's funny.

07:45.385 --> 07:46.803
That's very funny.

07:49.181 --> 07:50.599
Are you still here?

07:50.682 --> 07:52.267
Of course, I'm fuckin' here.

07:52.350 --> 07:53.852
Alright, we have one shot.

07:53.935 --> 07:55.771
Alright? One fuckin' shot.

07:55.854 --> 07:58.273
We're gonna put on the best fucking show
they've ever seen. All right?

07:58.356 --> 08:01.777
-Aye-aye, Captain!
-Shut the fuck up!

08:04.196 --> 08:06.364
-Shut the fuck up?
-Yeah, shut the fuck up.

08:06.448 --> 08:07.449
Nobody's talking to you.

08:07.532 --> 08:08.909
Well, you're talkin' to my people.

08:08.992 --> 08:11.411
-They're an extension of me.
-Tedros,

08:11.495 --> 08:13.205
these are my fucking people now.

08:13.288 --> 08:15.874
Oh, really?
You just come and you just swoop down

08:15.957 --> 08:17.292
and you just fuckin' take it?

08:17.375 --> 08:21.421
You are a sweaty, drunken,
fucking, pathetic mess.

08:21.505 --> 08:23.340
I'm getting ready for my show.

08:23.423 --> 08:24.800
-Alright?
-Our show.

08:24.883 --> 08:28.220
Do you fucking understand?
They're gonna cancel this fucking tour.

08:28.303 --> 08:30.639
All right? You're being a fucking
distraction right now.

08:30.722 --> 08:32.432
I'm talking about putting on
the greatest fucking show

08:32.516 --> 08:34.768
they've ever seen.
Are we fucking ready for that?

08:35.435 --> 08:36.311
This is it.

08:36.394 --> 08:40.857
The difference between me and him
is I can actually make you a star.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.616
Xander, come here.

08:50.367 --> 08:51.576
Come here.

08:55.914 --> 08:58.083
-What's up?
-You gonna let her do that to you?

08:58.667 --> 08:59.709
Do what?

08:59.793 --> 09:02.170
You gonna let her fuckin' cut you out
of the fuckin' show?

09:03.171 --> 09:04.589
Come on, Xander.

09:04.673 --> 09:06.883
You're gonna let her fuckin' walk
all over you like before?

09:06.967 --> 09:09.386
You have a fuckin' gift.
Don't fuckin' forget that.

09:09.469 --> 09:11.471
Okay?
You're fuckin' talented.

09:11.555 --> 09:12.681
I want the world to see it.

09:12.764 --> 09:16.852
You gotta fuckin' take it, man.
You gotta take it by the fuckin' balls.

09:18.770 --> 09:21.773
-Yeah, I can do that.
-All right, go sit down.

09:29.281 --> 09:31.575
All right, so you heard her, right?
One o'clock.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.952
These fucking bigwigs
are gonna get down here.

09:34.035 --> 09:36.830
Let's fuckin' look good.
Let's clean this fuckin' place up.

09:36.913 --> 09:39.166
Let's look sexy, right?

09:39.249 --> 09:41.752
Bianca,
I wanna see some ass and fuckin' tits.

09:41.835 --> 09:43.795
Don't forget, sex sells.

09:43.879 --> 09:46.173
If they're giving you any attention,
you fuckin' lean into it.

09:46.256 --> 09:49.009
If you gotta suck dick to keep 'em here,
keep 'em here.

09:49.092 --> 09:50.177
All right, what are you guys waiting for?
Get up. Let's go.

09:50.260 --> 09:52.637
Let's clean this fuckin' place up.

09:53.054 --> 09:54.264
Come on!

11:06.420 --> 11:08.547
He's like a really hot Targaryen.

11:08.630 --> 11:10.465
Is she opening an Abercrombie?

11:10.549 --> 11:11.925
-Look.
-I don't really...

11:12.008 --> 11:13.593
-Hi. Hello.
-Hi. Yeah, we're coming.

11:13.677 --> 11:15.053

11:17.889 --> 11:18.849
-What's going on?
-Where's Joss?

11:18.932 --> 11:20.725
Are we overdressed?
What's going on here?

11:20.809 --> 11:22.227
-Hi.
-Welcome home.

11:22.310 --> 11:24.604
-Okay. Hello.
-So good to see you.

11:24.688 --> 11:27.232
-You're even more beautiful in person.
-How lovely to meet you.

11:27.315 --> 11:29.109
Hey, hi. I guess we're hugging now.

11:29.192 --> 11:32.362
-Gorgeous. Your face is so tight.
-Thank you.

11:32.446 --> 11:34.322
Jocelyn. Where is she? She's in--

11:34.406 --> 11:36.074
-'Kay, she's in here. Okay.
-She's just--

11:36.158 --> 11:38.285
-It's so good to see you.
-I'm sorry, what was your name again?

11:38.368 --> 11:41.163
-My name's Izaak with a "z."
-Izaak. Izaak with a "z."

11:41.246 --> 11:43.540
-Yeah, lovely to meet you.

Come on. Come on.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.061

12:05.145 --> 12:06.313
Yeah, yeah.
She'll be down. Have a seat.

12:06.396 --> 12:07.522
She knows we're here, right?

12:07.606 --> 12:08.732
Did you tell her
Andrew Finkelstein's here?

12:08.815 --> 12:09.858
Of course, she's here. Of course.

12:09.941 --> 12:10.859
-Are you kidding me?
-Told her, right?

12:10.942 --> 12:11.818
You want a drink?

12:11.902 --> 12:13.236
-No, I'm good. Thank you.
-Are you sure?

12:13.320 --> 12:14.488
You guys want a drink? Bianca!

12:14.571 --> 12:15.530
-Oh, my God!
-Yeah.

12:15.614 --> 12:16.698
-Drinks!
-I don't think she heard you.

12:16.782 --> 12:17.783
A little louder.

12:17.866 --> 12:19.326
You guys wanted fuckin' hits?

12:19.409 --> 12:21.536
Look at this.
I got you fuckin' hits over here.

12:21.620 --> 12:23.455
Hey, music to my fuckin' ears.

12:23.538 --> 12:25.874
-Beautiful.
-You know? We want to hear it.

12:25.957 --> 12:27.793
-Can I get you something?
-Okay.

12:28.418 --> 12:29.836
Sure. A water would be great.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.421
-Thank you.
-How about you?

12:33.090 --> 12:34.966
-A whiskey, please.
-You?

12:35.050 --> 12:38.011
-Long Island Iced Tea.
-No, I'm fine, thank you.

12:38.095 --> 12:40.472
Are you sure I can't suggest something
a little bit more fun?

12:40.555 --> 12:41.723
No, it's 1:00 in the afternoon.

12:41.807 --> 12:42.974
Water is very fun. Thank you.

12:43.058 --> 12:44.684
Meet me upstairs.

12:47.562 --> 12:48.480
I'm sorry.

12:48.563 --> 12:50.232
-This is Tedr-- Please, forgive me.
-All right, yeah.

12:50.315 --> 12:53.568
-Tedros, this is Fink and Nikki.
-Sorry. Hello.

12:53.652 --> 12:55.320
This is the producer
I was telling you about...

12:55.404 --> 12:56.863
-Hi.
-...who's working with Joss.

13:00.992 --> 13:03.495
I'm gonna text Jocelyn
'cause I don't really know what's

13:03.578 --> 13:04.538
going on right now.

13:04.621 --> 13:06.206
Look, I think it's critical

13:06.289 --> 13:08.041
that if we're gonna be
working with each other,

13:08.125 --> 13:09.793
that we're able to trust each other,
right?

13:09.876 --> 13:10.710
Yeah.

13:10.794 --> 13:12.838
And that there's no fuckin' Judas
in the room.

13:12.921 --> 13:16.675
-Oh, okay. So, I'm Judas in this--
-That's right.

13:17.634 --> 13:18.844
That's right, I'm lookin' at you.

13:18.927 --> 13:22.556
What?
Dude, I've never even met you before.

13:22.639 --> 13:25.767
Exactly, and what you did with Dyanne
was fucked up.

13:25.851 --> 13:27.561
I gave Dyanne a great deal.

13:27.644 --> 13:29.020
No, you should've called me.

13:29.104 --> 13:30.897
I'm really trying to understand it,
why would I--

13:30.981 --> 13:33.275
Let me help you understand.
You have no fucking taste.

13:33.358 --> 13:34.735
Well, sometimes. Yes.

13:34.818 --> 13:35.986
You have no imagination.

13:36.069 --> 13:37.654
You have no vision.

13:37.738 --> 13:39.030
-Okay.
-You know, you're just--

13:39.114 --> 13:43.118
You're just a fucking TikTok-obsessed
fucking algorithm cunt.

13:44.786 --> 13:46.037
Okay, dude.

13:46.121 --> 13:47.998
-That's a little cliche.
-He's got a point.

13:48.081 --> 13:50.417
And that's a little bit
the pot calling the kettle black.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.127
-Nikki, I've got--
-Black, of course.

13:52.210 --> 13:53.253
-Yeah, black.
-Guys, hey, listen.

13:53.336 --> 13:54.838
Izaak, you hear that shit? Black?

13:54.921 --> 13:56.339
Hey, man,
we're gonna take it down a notch.

13:56.423 --> 13:59.384
Reality is, in five minutes,
I'm gonna get up and leave,

13:59.468 --> 14:01.136
and I'm gonna take the whole fuckin'
tour with me.

14:01.762 --> 14:04.598
So, if there's someone here
from Clown World

14:04.681 --> 14:05.932
who could go and get her for me,

14:06.016 --> 14:08.143
I'd like to have a fucking meeting
that I came here for.

14:08.226 --> 14:10.270
Otherwise, I'm outta here.

14:10.729 --> 14:11.938
You got it.

14:15.859 --> 14:20.280
I mean, is it just me or does this
whole thing feel like some fucking cult?

14:20.363 --> 14:21.907
Cult? It's a fuckin' NXIVM meeting.

14:21.990 --> 14:23.950
I'm surprised they didn't
brand us on the way in.

14:24.034 --> 14:26.620
Just sit tight because
we're gonna hear some good stuff.

14:26.703 --> 14:29.206
No, this is weird even by
music business standards.

14:29.289 --> 14:32.250
-What the fuck is this?
-Well, it's a little weird.

14:32.334 --> 14:33.627
-She'll be down.
-'Kay.

14:33.710 --> 14:35.212
Good. Four minutes.

14:35.295 --> 14:36.713
We just got into a fight.

14:38.006 --> 14:39.633
Are you sure this is gonna be all right?

14:39.716 --> 14:42.135
I wouldn't bring you here
if it's about to be some bullshit.

14:43.762 --> 14:46.431
Chloe, can you do me a favor?

14:46.515 --> 14:50.519
Would you mind singing that song
that you were working on with Tedros?

14:50.602 --> 14:52.104
-"Like A God"?
-Yeah.

14:52.187 --> 14:54.397
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go ahead, Chloe.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.486
What are we doing?

14:59.569 --> 15:01.154
I'm out, I'm out.

15:01.238 --> 15:02.697
No, no, no. Nikki, Nikki, Nikki, Nikki.

15:02.781 --> 15:04.074
What is this, fuckin' "Star Search"?

15:04.157 --> 15:06.576
Watches over like a god

15:06.660 --> 15:08.203
I'm out.

15:09.955 --> 15:15.460
Makes you hurt again
so you can heal and say amen

15:15.877 --> 15:17.254
We will change for you

15:17.337 --> 15:20.590
Chaim, I mean, she's talented,

15:20.674 --> 15:22.592
but so was the fuckin'
banjo boy in "Deliverance."

15:22.676 --> 15:23.802
I mean, what are we doing?

15:25.011 --> 15:29.224
Ah, ah-ah-ah, oh

15:29.307 --> 15:33.770
Ooh, ohh

15:33.854 --> 15:39.860
To get the pain out,
you have to let him make you cry

15:39.943 --> 15:43.363
I know you're scared

15:43.447 --> 15:46.032
-Boom.
-Like a god in the sky

15:46.116 --> 15:48.618
Would I ever lead you astray?

15:48.702 --> 15:50.078
I mean, my God.

15:50.996 --> 15:52.873
-She's fuckin' good.
-She is good.

15:52.956 --> 15:54.583
I give her five stars.

15:54.666 --> 15:57.961
Fantastic. I feel like fuckin'
Ed McMahon over here.

15:58.044 --> 16:01.173
Like a god

16:01.256 --> 16:04.301
-Let me listen, let me listen.
-Hey, I'm listening.

16:04.384 --> 16:07.220
You know, I'm listening to the fuckin'
sound of my bank account draining again.

16:07.304 --> 16:08.472
Ooh

16:08.555 --> 16:10.182
There's somethin' fuckin' wrong here.

16:10.265 --> 16:13.351
Are we at fucking Hunter Biden's house?
What the hell is going on here?

16:13.435 --> 16:17.063
If you shut the fuck up you would hear
that this girl's incredible, yeah?

16:17.147 --> 16:18.273
You know, she is incredible.

16:18.356 --> 16:20.484
Do you know who else was really talented?
Charles Manson.

16:20.567 --> 16:21.610
You know what else he did?

16:21.693 --> 16:24.154
He moved into Dennis Wilson's house
and lived there for a year and a half.

16:24.237 --> 16:27.365
They had to fuckin' tear out the walls
'cause there was so much pubic lice

16:27.449 --> 16:30.118
in the fucking wood paneling.
That's what's happening here.

16:30.202 --> 16:33.580
I can fuckin' see the crabs
crawling around on the floor.

16:33.663 --> 16:35.582
Is there a moment in your life
you're not fuckin' talking?

16:35.665 --> 16:37.167
Shut the fuck up.

16:39.503 --> 16:42.756
He is coming

16:43.632 --> 16:48.762
And he will find her

16:49.137 --> 16:53.016
He will fix her

16:53.100 --> 16:58.438
To make us better, better

16:58.522 --> 16:59.940
Ooh

17:00.023 --> 17:01.525
-Rob, I--
-There is nothing

17:01.608 --> 17:04.069
more important than this, Leia.
I'm fucking serious.

17:04.152 --> 17:06.321
-My entire life is getting destroyed.
-No, Rob, Rob, I--

17:06.405 --> 17:07.989
I'm trying to get her to talk to you.

17:08.073 --> 17:10.242
It's just, like,
insane at the house today.

17:10.325 --> 17:11.993
-Okay, but, Leia--
-Everyone is here right now.

17:12.077 --> 17:13.370
There's, like, 40 people at the house

17:13.453 --> 17:16.540
and they're, like, jamming out.
I don't know.

17:16.623 --> 17:17.958
I don't give a fuck, Leia.

17:18.041 --> 17:21.378
I don't give a fuck.
I'm telling you, I didn't rape anyone

17:21.461 --> 17:23.505
at Jocelyn's house. I didn't do this.

17:23.588 --> 17:25.882
I know, I know,
I know you're not a rapist!

17:25.966 --> 17:27.717
-I know.
-Yeah, okay, but I need Jocelyn

17:27.801 --> 17:29.386
to go on record and clear this up.

17:29.469 --> 17:32.806
I met this girl really briefly
at the bottom of the fucking steps

17:32.889 --> 17:35.892
when Xander asked me
to take a fucking photo.

17:36.893 --> 17:39.855
Wait, what do you mean
Xander asked you to take a photo?

17:39.938 --> 17:41.898
He literally was like,
"Hey, my friend's a fan.

17:41.982 --> 17:42.816
Can I take a photo?"

17:42.899 --> 17:44.484
And then this girl just
jumped in my fucking lap,

17:44.568 --> 17:46.611
and now she's going to the press saying
I raped her?

17:46.695 --> 17:48.739
And she has witnesses?

17:49.156 --> 17:50.157
Leia?

17:50.657 --> 17:52.826
-Leia!
-I'm gonna call you back.

17:52.909 --> 17:57.914
Like a god

18:06.423 --> 18:08.216
I'm so happy you guys got to hear Chloe.

18:09.009 --> 18:10.302
-I know.
-Isn't she fucking incredible?

18:10.385 --> 18:12.053
-Incredible.
-She's a part of my opening act.

18:12.137 --> 18:13.180
-Oh, great!
-Xander, Xander.

18:13.263 --> 18:15.140
Can you step out with me for just, like,
a second?

18:15.223 --> 18:16.224
Step out with you?

18:16.308 --> 18:18.268
Yeah, can we just step out?
I have to tell you something.

18:18.351 --> 18:19.519
No, I'm not fucking stepping--

18:19.603 --> 18:20.896
Yeah, I know, but it's an emergency.

18:20.979 --> 18:23.148
Just a quick conversation in private
without the other--

18:23.231 --> 18:25.901
I want you to hear Izaak because
Izaak is going to blow you away.

18:25.984 --> 18:28.945
Okay, I'm happy to hear him.
Maybe we'll just do it after.

18:29.029 --> 18:30.906
-Can you just please--
-Shut the fuck up.

18:30.989 --> 18:32.074
But I'm just a little bit worried--

18:32.157 --> 18:34.242
I just wanna make sure
that you're in a good place

18:34.326 --> 18:35.952
because if-- No matter how good he--

18:36.036 --> 18:37.496
I know you're anxious, all right?

18:37.579 --> 18:39.748
We always do this.
I'm here to calm you down.

18:39.831 --> 18:42.209
I'm a Jew. I'm anxious. It's in my DNA.

18:42.292 --> 18:44.503
Look at me,
everything is going to be fine.

18:44.586 --> 18:46.630
Hey. Get outta here.

18:49.257 --> 18:51.510
-Get the fuck out!
-It's not-- We--

18:51.593 --> 18:54.513
Hey.
I want you to listen to Izaak

18:54.596 --> 18:59.392
and I promise you,
everything is going to be fine. Okay?

18:59.476 --> 19:01.853
-Okay. I will.
-Sit and enjoy. I'm so happy you're here.

19:01.937 --> 19:04.064
-Okay?
-I'll enjoy. All right. Sitting.

19:04.147 --> 19:06.358
-Jocelyn, Jocelyn.
-We're listening to Izaak.

19:07.150 --> 19:08.819
-Jocelyn.
-Stop.

19:15.492 --> 19:17.494
Hey, baby

19:18.578 --> 19:22.290
Ooh, ahh

19:22.624 --> 19:27.254
Ooh, ahh

19:28.130 --> 19:31.925
I don't know what
you still want me for

19:32.008 --> 19:36.054
You've seen a lot,
but you could see some more

19:36.138 --> 19:39.099
Look at this shit.
This guy's a fuckin' god.

19:39.182 --> 19:41.726
I mean, come on.
The talent is fuckin' undeniable.

19:41.810 --> 19:44.396
-Exactly. Sex sells.
-No, he's amazing.

19:44.479 --> 19:48.275
But, mentally, I'm still--
Some questions about her stability.

19:48.358 --> 19:49.985
I gotta be honest,
I'm not terribly convinced

19:50.068 --> 19:51.278
after the last 20 minutes.

19:51.361 --> 19:55.741
I fucking love Joss,
but you wanna tell me that girl's sane?

19:55.824 --> 19:58.368
Absolutely. Look, she's out there.

19:58.452 --> 20:01.121
She's had problems, we all know,
but she's gonna fuckin' deliver.

20:01.204 --> 20:02.748
Look at this! Look at this.

20:02.831 --> 20:04.124
-I'm looking at it.
-Joss.

20:04.207 --> 20:06.543
This is what puts the asses
in the seats in the arenas.

20:06.626 --> 20:08.837
You don't see this shit normally.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.089
You know, fuckin' Kanye was filling arenas

20:11.173 --> 20:13.300
until he decided to start following
Adolf Hitler.

20:13.383 --> 20:16.219
Ooh, it feels so right

20:16.303 --> 20:18.847
I don't wanna fight

20:18.930 --> 20:20.891
Come on. Oh, my God.

20:20.974 --> 20:23.393
Here, ahh

20:23.477 --> 20:25.270
-It's work, it's working.
-I'm just gonna lay down.

20:25.353 --> 20:26.605
You don't get it before

20:26.688 --> 20:27.981
Don't get it before

20:28.064 --> 20:31.735
This woman gave up on sex.
This guy is like-- He's actually--

20:32.402 --> 20:33.945
-Cobwebs are cleaning out.
-He is very special.

20:34.029 --> 20:36.281
Jesus, where did you find this guy?

20:36.364 --> 20:38.033
Ah

20:38.116 --> 20:39.242
You don't get it before

20:39.326 --> 20:41.036
-I'm sorry.
-Stop looking at me.

20:41.119 --> 20:43.246
-Yeah, he can sing like a motherfucker.
-Bro, where'd they--

20:43.330 --> 20:45.332
Well, he's fuckin' dry humpin' this bitch.

20:45.415 --> 20:46.708
No shit, right?

20:46.792 --> 20:48.668
They don't do showcases
like this in Texas.

20:48.752 --> 20:50.337
Maybe Atlanta.

20:52.672 --> 20:55.675
-Break it down
-Thank you.

20:56.259 --> 20:59.262
For ya, yeah

21:00.222 --> 21:03.683
Spell it out

21:03.767 --> 21:06.770
For ya

21:06.853 --> 21:09.815
And I won't just reroute, ooh

21:09.898 --> 21:11.400
Yeah!

21:12.526 --> 21:13.443
Did you hear that riff?

21:14.111 --> 21:15.695
I haven't seen shit like this
since Prince.

21:15.779 --> 21:18.573
That motherfucker has the soul of Prince.

21:18.657 --> 21:19.866
And this motherfucker
is in the living room.

21:19.950 --> 21:20.951
I mean, look at him.

21:21.034 --> 21:24.371
Nobody knows who this kid is.
But you do.

21:25.497 --> 21:28.708
-Joss! What, are you kidding me?
-Did I tell you?

21:28.792 --> 21:31.753
You don't get it before

21:31.837 --> 21:33.422
I thought he was just your doorman.

21:33.505 --> 21:36.758
Xander, Xander.
Will you step out with me after this?

21:37.175 --> 21:38.677
-Literally in the middle of a showcase.
-Can you just-- I know.

21:38.760 --> 21:39.594
It's really important.

21:39.678 --> 21:41.179
Can you please fucking relax
for one second?

21:41.263 --> 21:43.348
You're so annoying. Fucking Christ.

21:46.017 --> 21:48.520
-And they're completely different.
-Yeah, I know. They're a trio.

21:48.603 --> 21:50.772
-I know.
-Imagine this on a fucking stage.

21:54.317 --> 21:55.318
Yeah!

21:57.863 --> 21:59.656
-Amazing!
-Izaak!

21:59.740 --> 22:01.658
We might have to reupholster the couch.

22:01.742 --> 22:04.035
I think we got some snail trails
goin' on over here.

22:04.119 --> 22:06.621
Xander, please, can you just come here
for just one second?

22:06.705 --> 22:08.081
-Please.
-What?

22:08.165 --> 22:09.291
-I'm sorry, I'm sor--
-What's wrong?

22:09.374 --> 22:10.876
You okay?

22:10.959 --> 22:12.169
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Ya sure?

22:16.173 --> 22:19.384
Sorry, can we just talk alone
for a second, please?

22:20.427 --> 22:22.053
No, Mitch is family.

22:23.847 --> 22:27.476
Okay, Rob has been accused
of sexual assault

22:27.559 --> 22:30.228
and the news is about to go public.

22:30.312 --> 22:31.521
Oh, no.

22:32.105 --> 22:34.274
He's got that huge movie coming out.

22:34.357 --> 22:35.817
We have a couple more surprises.

22:35.901 --> 22:38.361
-There's more?
-Ramsey. Ramsey's up next.

22:39.988 --> 22:40.989
There's another one.

22:41.073 --> 22:42.574
-There's more? We have more?
-Really, another one?

22:42.657 --> 22:43.575
Yeah.

22:43.658 --> 22:48.038
I've been trying to tell Jocelyn
and I can't get her to listen to me.

22:48.830 --> 22:51.249
What, you think she doesn't already
know about this?

22:52.167 --> 22:53.585
You think that she knows?

22:55.253 --> 22:57.881
There's a reason she hasn't
answered his calls.

22:58.924 --> 23:01.593
Yeah, but I don't think Rob
would do something like that.

23:01.676 --> 23:04.930
You don't think people
are capable of hiding who they really are?

23:06.389 --> 23:10.018
You walked in the room
made my eyes light up

23:11.478 --> 23:15.482
What could I do
to make your eyes wider

23:16.066 --> 23:18.235
Something came down to me

23:18.568 --> 23:20.946
Said that boy belongs to me

23:21.029 --> 23:25.617
Told me to cast a spell and do it well

23:25.700 --> 23:27.411
Make my way to the bar

23:27.494 --> 23:29.079
-Isn't she crazy?
-This is three for three.

23:29.162 --> 23:31.248
-I know.
-All of them are unsigned?

23:31.331 --> 23:32.958
None of these kids are signed.

23:33.041 --> 23:34.501
-None of them are fuckin' signed.
-Not a one.

23:34.584 --> 23:37.129
-How is that possible?
-He found them.

23:37.212 --> 23:40.632
-Tedros found them.
-Scarface Miyagi over here found them?

23:41.049 --> 23:43.343
I mean, the guy can barely put
a sentence together.

23:43.427 --> 23:45.137
You did this?

23:45.220 --> 23:47.556
-You did this?
-Yeah. This is--

23:47.639 --> 23:48.932
I mean, it's amazing.

23:49.015 --> 23:50.809
You may not believe it,

23:50.892 --> 23:53.728
but she's tryna take
all the credit for it but this is--

23:53.812 --> 23:55.105
I know.

23:55.188 --> 23:56.773
These are my babies.

23:56.857 --> 23:59.776
I can see it. I know it's you.

24:00.360 --> 24:03.655
-You can?
-Yeah, I know. This is incredible.

24:03.739 --> 24:06.324
It's a fuckin' treasure trove of talent.

24:11.079 --> 24:13.749
I'm tellin' you,
on stage in a fucking show?

24:13.832 --> 24:14.875
I don't believe this.

24:14.958 --> 24:17.002
We need to bottle this
for the fuckin' tour.

24:17.085 --> 24:21.131
I don't know, somehow, we see eye-to-eye
even though you're fucked up.

24:21.214 --> 24:23.967
-You know what?
-Okay. Yeah.

24:24.050 --> 24:25.844
Are you a little loaded?

24:25.927 --> 24:27.387
-And I'm not judging.
-No.

24:27.471 --> 24:28.597
-No?
-No.

24:29.014 --> 24:30.640
I'm so high right now, I don't know what

24:30.724 --> 24:32.559
-the fuck is goin' on.
-Bruh, high?

24:32.642 --> 24:33.643
Look at that dude over there.

24:33.727 --> 24:35.729
He's sweatin' like a whore in church,

24:35.812 --> 24:38.523
and he looks like it's,
like, day three or four.

24:38.607 --> 24:40.025
Like, he was just yellin' at that bitch,

24:40.108 --> 24:42.152
and now he's over there, like,
havin' a conversation.

24:42.235 --> 24:44.029
I don't trust anybody
with a rattail like that.

24:47.199 --> 24:48.366
That's good shit.

24:49.201 --> 24:50.786
-Yes!
-Three for three!

24:50.869 --> 24:52.412
Okay. Yeah.

24:52.496 --> 24:54.164
Any second now

24:54.247 --> 24:56.333
-This is not--
-Any second now

24:56.416 --> 24:59.920
-We got a little ring.
-Any second now

25:00.003 --> 25:02.089
-Watch my face melt
-You're amazing.

25:02.172 --> 25:03.590
You're amazing!

25:03.673 --> 25:04.841
You're amazing!

25:08.512 --> 25:10.138
They're like this.

25:12.057 --> 25:15.143
If he really found these people,
he's legitimately a genius.

25:15.227 --> 25:16.978
You know, we might have to tour
with a paramedic

25:17.062 --> 25:18.814
to fuckin' jab him
with an adrenaline shot--

25:18.897 --> 25:20.816
Look, I don't know
that it's all Tedros. Not all him.

25:20.899 --> 25:24.027
I mean, Jocelyn's been mentoring
these people, nurturing them.

25:24.111 --> 25:26.196
Without her,
none of this would be happening.

25:26.279 --> 25:28.865
I know that Jocelyn didn't do this.
You did it.

25:28.949 --> 25:32.911
This has you all over it,
and these people are gonna fuck you up

25:32.994 --> 25:35.372
because they wanna believe
that it's just Jocelyn.

25:35.455 --> 25:37.040
-They do.
-I know, they'll fuck you over.

25:37.457 --> 25:39.167
I noticed that.
They won't even acknowledge.

25:39.251 --> 25:43.547
What I know is I need you
to bring me this good shit.

25:43.630 --> 25:44.714
Fuck Nikki.

25:45.298 --> 25:46.466
We do this shit on our own.

25:46.550 --> 25:48.510
-Okay.
-I'm tired of givin' shit to them.

25:48.593 --> 25:50.137
I was here all by my fuckin' self

25:50.220 --> 25:51.888
with these fuckin' kids.

25:51.972 --> 25:53.640
I ain't givin' this shit to Nikki.

25:53.723 --> 25:55.434
Look, let's work together.

25:55.517 --> 25:57.811
Don't mess with Chaim,
don't mess with Destiny.

25:57.894 --> 25:59.229
Just, let's work together.

25:59.312 --> 26:01.648
No offense, ya know,
it's not about the politicking

26:01.731 --> 26:04.651
and the fuckin' propagandas
and all that shit.

26:04.735 --> 26:07.362
-This is real art, you know?
-That's what I keep saying.

26:07.446 --> 26:09.531
That's what I keep telling people.
It's not about what you say, though.

26:09.614 --> 26:11.283
You gotta have balls.

26:11.366 --> 26:13.410
-I've got balls.
-You got balls?

26:13.493 --> 26:14.619
I got balls.

26:14.703 --> 26:16.455
Have you made the inroads
already with them?

26:16.538 --> 26:18.623
I know they mamas, they dog's name.

26:18.707 --> 26:21.042
I know the one kid's
favorite fuckin' ice cream.

26:22.002 --> 26:23.044
We in pocket.

26:23.128 --> 26:26.798
You're brilliant. You're brilliant.

26:26.882 --> 26:30.051
You're a little loaded,
but you're brilliant.

26:30.135 --> 26:32.304
And I'm telling you, I wanna work with you

26:32.387 --> 26:35.515
after you called me a cunt
because you're not wrong.

26:35.599 --> 26:38.685
-Wait, you are a cunt?
-Yeah, but I can be your cunt.

26:40.896 --> 26:43.482
-Come on!
-Yeah, you like that.

26:47.152 --> 26:48.153
One after the other.

26:48.236 --> 26:50.405
Are you crazy?
How could you keep this from me?

26:51.490 --> 26:52.908
Unbelievable.

26:53.825 --> 26:56.787
Wait, wait. I just got something
in my phone about Rob?

26:56.870 --> 26:58.955
Didn't you used to date a Rob Turner?

26:59.039 --> 27:01.333
-What?
-Rob Turner. Ya know, he was that

27:01.416 --> 27:04.419
sexy superhero actor guy Jocelyn
used to sleep with.

27:04.503 --> 27:07.297
-What about him?
-Well, he was just accused of rape.

27:07.380 --> 27:10.926
-What?
-Yeah, apparently, he raped a woman.

27:11.009 --> 27:13.011
A very well-endowed woman.

27:13.095 --> 27:14.513
-Wait, let me see. Let me see.
-Yeah.

27:14.596 --> 27:16.056
Wait, let me see. Let me see.

27:16.139 --> 27:18.183
We gotta keep Joss outta this.

27:18.266 --> 27:19.601
Oh, shit.

27:21.686 --> 27:25.065
That's a-- Oh, wait. Oh, my God.

27:25.148 --> 27:27.609
This is what I love about Hollywood.
All right, listen.

27:27.692 --> 27:31.530
"The recent allegations
about Rob Turner's behavior

27:31.613 --> 27:34.741
"are not aligned with the values we
hold as a company.

27:34.825 --> 27:37.411
"We would like to make clear
to all of the fans out there

27:37.494 --> 27:41.832
"that Rob Turner's face appears in less
than 5% of the film.

27:42.207 --> 27:45.544
"And to ensure that his actions cannot
do more harm,

27:45.627 --> 27:50.132
"we have taken the necessary steps
of digitally replacing him.

27:50.465 --> 27:54.010
"We won't let one individual's behavior
derail the work of thousands.

27:54.094 --> 27:56.179
"And so we plan to continue forward

27:56.263 --> 27:58.306
with our summer release strategy."

27:58.390 --> 28:00.684
We are in the wrong fucking business.

28:00.767 --> 28:02.519
Do you know how many singers

28:02.602 --> 28:04.438
whose face I just wanted
to fuckin' switch out?

28:04.521 --> 28:06.398
Not you.
You have a face like an angel, honey.

28:06.481 --> 28:07.566
But some of these girls
are like a catcher's mitt.

28:07.649 --> 28:08.483
What evidence do they have?

28:08.567 --> 28:11.486
Well, you saw the girl, right?
Was he ever weird with you, though?

28:12.320 --> 28:14.823
-No.
-I've heard stories.

28:14.906 --> 28:16.450
-You have?
-Like what?

28:17.701 --> 28:20.746
-Things.
-Like what kind of things?

28:20.829 --> 28:22.372
Like violent things.

28:22.456 --> 28:25.459
-What the fuck?
-Did you hear about this?

28:25.542 --> 28:26.835
-No, I didn't hear about this shit.
-Go.

28:26.918 --> 28:29.171
Rob was fine.
He was real commercial.

28:29.254 --> 28:31.465
Guys. Hello?

28:31.548 --> 28:33.300
I was kinda thinking that

28:33.842 --> 28:36.511
maybe I should sing something?

28:37.053 --> 28:39.097
-Yeah.
-You're gonna join the hit parade?

28:39.181 --> 28:40.390
Why the fuck not, right?

28:40.891 --> 28:42.517
-Tough act to follow, but.
-Yeah.

28:42.601 --> 28:43.685
Fuck yeah, let's hear it.

28:43.769 --> 28:45.520
Yeah, this is gonna be great.

28:45.604 --> 28:48.648
Don't tease me here 'cause--

28:48.732 --> 28:51.026
This is your song.

28:51.651 --> 28:53.070
I love this song.

28:56.198 --> 28:58.200
Joss, did you plan this?

28:58.825 --> 29:01.745
Well, we decided to put on a show.

29:01.828 --> 29:03.830
My sweet Lord

29:03.914 --> 29:05.832
-Goddamn.
-Come on.

29:05.916 --> 29:07.876
Oh, my Lord

29:07.959 --> 29:09.753
-Are you kidding?
-Fuckin' chills.

29:09.836 --> 29:12.839
-Mm, my Lord
-He's still got it.

29:13.757 --> 29:20.430
I really wanna see you,
I really wanna be with you

29:21.681 --> 29:24.059
I really wanna see you, Lord

29:24.142 --> 29:28.146
But it takes so long, my Lord

29:29.439 --> 29:31.191
My sweet Lord

29:31.274 --> 29:32.859
You think I don't know you did this?

29:32.943 --> 29:34.069
My, my, my Lord

29:34.152 --> 29:35.153
What?

29:35.237 --> 29:39.408
Because you're small and you're petty
and you're jealous.

29:40.992 --> 29:43.412
-Fuck you.
-Really wanna know you

29:43.495 --> 29:44.579
Do you see this?

29:45.455 --> 29:47.916
-Really wanna go with you
-That's not good.

29:49.251 --> 29:51.628
I really wanna show you, Lord

29:51.711 --> 29:54.631
But it won't take long, my Lord

29:54.714 --> 29:56.591
No thank you. I'm good.

29:57.342 --> 29:59.052
-No, I'm fine.
-Really wanna see you

29:59.136 --> 30:00.720
I'm really-- Yeah, I'm fine.

30:00.804 --> 30:03.640
-I'm just gonna watch from here.
-I really wanna see you

30:03.723 --> 30:05.225
Get on your fuckin' feet!

30:05.308 --> 30:07.185
He didn't fucking rape Sophie.

30:07.269 --> 30:09.020
That's a fucking ugly thing to say.

30:09.104 --> 30:11.148
Sophie's a good girl.

30:11.773 --> 30:14.317
Get out of my house.

30:15.569 --> 30:16.695
You don't mean that.

30:17.112 --> 30:18.238
Get out.

30:19.239 --> 30:21.575
-I'm not leaving.
-Then I'll call the cops.

30:21.658 --> 30:22.617
Then I'll keep you hostage.

30:22.701 --> 30:24.077
Then they'll fucking kill you.

30:24.161 --> 30:27.164
Not before I fucking kill you first,
bitch.

30:28.582 --> 30:32.002
I really wanna go with you

30:32.502 --> 30:34.880
I really wanna show you, Lord

30:34.963 --> 30:37.758
But it won't take long, my Lord

30:38.216 --> 30:40.844
Hare Krishna

30:40.927 --> 30:42.929
Aren't you proud of Xander?

30:44.055 --> 30:46.224
It's a miracle. He got his voice back.

30:54.441 --> 30:57.611
Pay him whatever the fuck he wants
to get out of my life forever.

30:59.654 --> 31:02.032
Say no more. Say no more.

31:02.949 --> 31:07.245
Oh, my, my Lord, Hallelujah

31:07.329 --> 31:11.208
Oh, my, my Lord, Hare Krishna

31:12.626 --> 31:16.588
Hallelujah, my sweet Lord

31:16.671 --> 31:18.006
Hare Krishna

31:18.090 --> 31:19.674
Come here, come here. You all right, man?

31:19.758 --> 31:20.634
Yeah.

31:20.717 --> 31:22.010
You look like you had
a little rough night or something.

31:22.094 --> 31:23.386
-You okay?
-No, no, no. I'm good, I'm good.

31:23.470 --> 31:24.554
All right.

31:24.638 --> 31:27.641
My sweet Lord, Hare Krishna

31:30.769 --> 31:32.562
-Xander!
-Xander.

31:32.646 --> 31:34.106
-My God.
-When's the last time you read

31:34.189 --> 31:36.191
the "Little Red Riding Hood"?

31:36.775 --> 31:38.735
When I was a kid in school.

31:38.819 --> 31:40.779
I read it to my little daughter
the other night.

31:40.862 --> 31:42.697
It's a fucking crazy story.

31:42.781 --> 31:44.199
I know I'm stating the obvious here,

31:44.282 --> 31:46.118
but if you guys performed
on stage together...

31:46.201 --> 31:47.035
Oh yeah.

31:47.119 --> 31:49.037
...fans' heads would literally explode.

31:49.121 --> 31:51.581
Fink, you are always one step ahead.

31:51.665 --> 31:53.125
Xander's gonna open for me.

31:53.208 --> 31:55.377
-Are you fuckin' serious?
-Yeah, of course, he is.

31:56.253 --> 31:57.295
People are gonna--

31:57.379 --> 31:59.506
This is gonna be the tour
of the fuckin' century.

31:59.589 --> 32:00.882
This is incredible.

32:00.966 --> 32:03.260
I mean, this is amazing.

32:08.390 --> 32:09.683
Love you.

32:10.517 --> 32:11.560
Amazing.

32:11.643 --> 32:13.770
Fink, we actually have one more
performance for you.

32:14.187 --> 32:16.982
Mike, would you mind putting your
chair right there?

32:17.065 --> 32:19.443
Oh God. I always get nervous

32:19.526 --> 32:21.111
when there's a chair
in the middle of the room.

32:21.194 --> 32:23.196
You remember
there's this big bad wolf, yeah?

32:23.280 --> 32:24.906
And he eats the grandmother,

32:24.990 --> 32:28.618
and he eats the little girl,
so he's really fuckin' happy with himself

32:28.702 --> 32:30.412
'cause he thinks he won, yeah?

32:30.495 --> 32:32.748
But, you remember what happens next?

32:32.831 --> 32:34.791
-No.
-Well, I didn't either.

32:43.175 --> 32:45.844
Well, there's this hunter that walks by

32:45.927 --> 32:48.555
and he hears really loud snoring
coming from the house.

32:48.638 --> 32:51.683
He figures,
"Ooh, I better check on the old lady."

32:51.767 --> 32:56.605
So, he opens the door and he looks inside.
What do you think he sees in there?

32:57.230 --> 33:00.317
-I don't fuckin' know.
-Well, he sees the big bad wolf asleep

33:00.400 --> 33:01.401
on the grandma's bed.

33:01.485 --> 33:03.862
I mean, like, he fuckin' owns the house.

33:03.945 --> 33:07.741
He can't believe it,
so he takes his shotgun, yeah,

33:07.824 --> 33:11.620
sticks it right between the wolf's eyes,
and he's just about to pull the trigger.

33:11.703 --> 33:13.288
He's gonna do it.
And he stops, he realizes,

33:13.371 --> 33:14.831
"Whoa, wait a minute.

33:14.915 --> 33:16.875
The grandma might
still be alive in there."

33:16.958 --> 33:19.127
So, he takes a scissors instead.

33:19.211 --> 33:22.464
He jams it into the wolf's guts
and snip, snip, snip.

33:22.547 --> 33:25.133
So, he keeps ripping the wolf open,
the wolf's screaming.

33:25.217 --> 33:27.427
He don't care.
Out comes the grandma

33:27.511 --> 33:29.554
and Little Red Riding Hood,
they're holding hands.

33:29.638 --> 33:31.264
And there's not a scratch
on their bodies.

33:31.348 --> 33:34.309
Thank God.
So now's when the story gets really weird.

33:35.352 --> 33:37.979
'Cause Little Red Riding Hood
gets this brilliant idea.

33:38.063 --> 33:41.066
Every day will be perfect...

33:41.149 --> 33:44.027
So, the hunter and Little Red Riding Hood
take these big rocks,

33:44.111 --> 33:47.739
and they stick it into the wolf's belly,
and they sew it closed.

33:47.823 --> 33:50.492
Okay? So, when the wolf
tries to run away,

33:50.575 --> 33:52.202
he fuckin' bleeds out
right in front of them.

33:52.285 --> 33:54.037
Just, bang!
Drops dead on the floor.

33:54.121 --> 34:00.377
Am I playin' all right now, Daddy

34:01.169 --> 34:03.463
Am I, am I

34:03.547 --> 34:05.674
Now, you gotta keep in mind,

34:05.757 --> 34:08.635
I'm reading this
to my five-year-old daughter.

34:08.718 --> 34:11.346
She says to me,
"Daddy, when you heard this story,

34:11.430 --> 34:13.598
you were a little boy. Were you scared?"

34:13.682 --> 34:15.016
I said, "No."

34:15.100 --> 34:16.726
She said, "Why not?"

34:16.810 --> 34:19.229
So, I look her right in the eye
and I said,

34:19.312 --> 34:20.522
"Because...

34:21.481 --> 34:23.024
I am the hunter."

34:30.699 --> 34:36.955
Somewhere

34:37.038 --> 34:42.043
In some other lifetime

34:43.587 --> 34:46.590
Am I, am I

34:46.673 --> 34:53.680
Am I playin' all right now, Daddy

34:55.724 --> 35:01.438
I roam free

35:01.521 --> 35:05.567
Strutting down my own, play it my way

35:05.650 --> 35:09.571
No kings, no slaves

35:09.654 --> 35:11.448
But right now

35:11.531 --> 35:16.661
You got me in a chokehold,
headlock, blindfold

35:16.745 --> 35:19.873
Don't stop, I don't need to see

35:19.956 --> 35:21.583
Have your way with me

35:21.666 --> 35:24.127
Keep me in the dollhouse

35:24.211 --> 35:27.672
Dressed up, perfect, messed up

35:27.756 --> 35:32.385
Friendly as can be
have your way with me

35:32.469 --> 35:36.139
Just prop me with my head high

35:37.682 --> 35:40.227
Doll house, dressed up

35:40.310 --> 35:42.521
Perfect, messed up

35:42.604 --> 35:46.191
Torture me with sleep,
paint the air I breathe

35:47.734 --> 35:51.571
Fishbowl, chokehold,
clear water, I'm full

35:51.655 --> 35:54.491
Perfect as can be

35:54.574 --> 35:55.826
Have your way with me

35:56.243 --> 35:59.037
Somewhere

35:59.121 --> 36:00.622
Come on, man.

36:00.705 --> 36:05.168
On some other timeline

36:05.252 --> 36:10.966
There's no price on me

36:11.049 --> 36:18.056
Nothing to compete with,
pray for, no games, no war

36:18.890 --> 36:23.520
I lay down every night at sunset

36:23.603 --> 36:27.399
Glowing, fairytale, knowing

36:27.482 --> 36:32.028
Doll house, dressed up,
perfect, messed up

36:32.112 --> 36:35.699
Torture me with sleep,
paint the air I breathe

36:36.950 --> 36:39.536
Fishbowl, chokehold

36:39.619 --> 36:42.205
Clear water, I'm full

36:42.289 --> 36:45.792
Dirty as can be, have your way with me

36:56.803 --> 37:00.599
So, I believe people
should be paid for their work.

37:00.682 --> 37:04.478
$500,000 for you, Mauricio Jackson.

37:04.561 --> 37:06.146
For this,
you get the fuck out of our lives.

37:06.229 --> 37:09.274
We don't hear from you,
we don't see you, nothing.

37:24.122 --> 37:26.124
You're tryna buy your girl back?

37:28.168 --> 37:29.503
You know, I went to prison for this shit.

37:29.586 --> 37:31.254
Am I, am I

37:32.589 --> 37:39.387
Am I playin' all right now, Daddy

37:39.471 --> 37:42.349
-Am I, am I
-She's worth so much more than money.

37:42.432 --> 37:47.729
Am I playin' all right now, Daddy

37:47.813 --> 37:51.233
Am I, am I

37:52.484 --> 37:58.156
Am I playin' all right now, Daddy

37:58.240 --> 38:00.200
Okay, well now we go to plan B.

38:00.283 --> 38:04.413
I fuckin' love plan B. I prefer it.

38:14.548 --> 38:17.300
What do you think? Are you excited?

38:17.384 --> 38:21.430
That was fucking fire.
I wish I'd brought a change of shorts.

38:22.973 --> 38:25.767
Are you fucking kidding me?

38:26.726 --> 38:28.311
I just wanna say, as your fan,

38:28.395 --> 38:30.480
that is one of the most
fucking incredible songs.

38:30.564 --> 38:34.359
It was so raw, and honest,
and beautiful, and fucking hot.

38:34.443 --> 38:37.279
Now, I was so worried when you threw out
the whole album.

38:37.362 --> 38:39.030
Thank God. You had to go through it.

38:39.114 --> 38:41.491
This is the best fucking music
that's ever poured out of you.

38:41.575 --> 38:43.744
And I swear to God,
the pain you went through,

38:43.827 --> 38:47.414
everything with your mom, all of it,
it all fuckin' led you to right here.

38:47.497 --> 38:50.250
As a parent figure,
I fucking couldn't be more proud of you.

38:50.333 --> 38:52.461
It's so beautiful.
Oh, my God.

38:53.503 --> 38:57.841
And, yeah, suffice to say,
suffice to say, the tour is back on.

38:57.924 --> 38:58.759
Yes!

38:58.842 --> 39:00.135
I'm not sure,
not sure if you got that by now.

39:01.762 --> 39:03.138
It was amazing, all of you guys.

39:03.221 --> 39:05.766
Really, you're incredible, all of you.

39:05.849 --> 39:09.311
I'm gonna take a cold shower
and finish my nine holes.

39:09.394 --> 39:11.563
You guys are fuckin' brilliant.
Thank you, guys.

39:11.646 --> 39:13.023
I don't know what happened to

39:13.106 --> 39:16.151
Tetris or Super Mario Brothers,
or wherever he is, but please,

39:16.234 --> 39:18.153
please tell him bye for me.

39:18.236 --> 39:20.155
All right, you guys, I'm outta here.

39:20.781 --> 39:25.202
You guys are it. You're it.
There's nobody else. Bye.

39:33.293 --> 39:34.878
Fuck yeah.

39:42.052 --> 39:45.222
I'm so, so proud of you.

39:46.181 --> 39:48.767
-I'm so happy.
-You should be.

39:52.479 --> 39:53.855
We're going on tour.

39:53.939 --> 39:55.357
We're going on tour.

39:57.901 --> 39:58.860
Fuck yeah.

40:28.390 --> 40:30.016
He's done.

40:33.353 --> 40:36.565
-How much did you have to pay him?
-A lot.

40:41.111 --> 40:43.947
-Do you mind if I just have a minute?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

41:38.585 --> 41:39.961
Dyanne, I have to tell you.

41:40.045 --> 41:43.840
Here at Magistrate Records,
we are so proud of all your hard work

41:43.924 --> 41:46.635
-and you continue to amaze us.
-Thank you.

41:46.718 --> 41:51.556
But there's been a bit of a hiccup.

41:52.224 --> 41:53.683
One of the writers--

41:53.767 --> 41:57.437
This guy. There's a legal problem.

41:57.521 --> 41:59.397
What do you mean?

42:01.358 --> 42:02.359
Well.

42:03.777 --> 42:06.154
We're going to have
to hold the release of the song.

42:06.238 --> 42:09.741
But you said I have
a full team of legal support.

42:10.200 --> 42:13.203
Right, and we want this resolved
as much as you do,

42:13.286 --> 42:15.497
but right now, we've done all we can.

42:17.207 --> 42:20.335
So, I mean if anything,

42:23.380 --> 42:25.340
this is good inspiration.

42:25.424 --> 42:28.427
I mean, why don't you try writing a song
of your own in the meantime?

42:28.510 --> 42:30.971
You want me to write a song
about a legal issue

42:31.054 --> 42:32.514
for my first single?

42:32.597 --> 42:34.933
Well, I'm just throwing ideas out there.

42:37.352 --> 42:40.355
But yeah, that is what I mean.

42:41.648 --> 42:43.859
I mean, Dyanne, we got you.

42:44.526 --> 42:45.736
100%.

42:46.486 --> 42:49.698
You're a star
and we're gonna make you a star.

42:52.868 --> 42:57.539
All right. Well, thank you so much.

42:57.622 --> 43:02.252
And we will reach out
and I will see you soon.

43:04.838 --> 43:07.632
It was Jocelyn, wasn't it?

43:38.080 --> 43:41.291
There we go, there we go. Let's go!

45:15.093 --> 45:16.511
When's your story due?

45:16.595 --> 45:18.263
Friday.

45:18.346 --> 45:20.766
Well, you might wanna fuckin' hold it.

45:20.849 --> 45:22.142
Why?

45:22.225 --> 45:24.436
'Cause I got a bigger story for you.

45:24.853 --> 45:29.399
My girl's in a lotta trouble,
and I could use your help.

45:31.610 --> 45:33.236
I'm listening.

46:22.911 --> 46:24.329
I love you!

46:24.704 --> 46:25.539
Hi.

47:20.302 --> 47:24.306
That's my family

47:25.348 --> 47:29.603
We don't like each other very much

47:29.686 --> 47:34.149
Oh, I'm okay with that

47:34.232 --> 47:37.444
But it breaks my mother's heart

47:39.988 --> 47:44.951
Ohh, ooh

47:45.035 --> 47:49.956
Ahh, ooh

47:50.040 --> 47:53.001
Ooh

47:53.085 --> 47:55.670
You know, I'm telling you,
there's a gold mine in mental illness.

47:55.754 --> 47:57.714
This thing is worth a fortune.
I'm fuckin' serious.

47:57.798 --> 47:58.673
Look at Jocelyn.

47:58.757 --> 48:01.676
All you have to do is admit it,
and then people feel sorry for you.

48:01.760 --> 48:04.513
All I know is, we sold out.

48:04.596 --> 48:07.224
She dropped three hit singles
in six fuckin' weeks

48:07.307 --> 48:10.894
and we're about to turn all those beauties
into global superstars.

48:10.977 --> 48:14.106
Hey, I'm not fuckin' complaining.
That's paid off for me.

48:14.189 --> 48:17.401
Yeah, don't pretend like
you weren't scared, Fink.

48:17.484 --> 48:18.860
-Never.
-Really?

48:18.944 --> 48:20.821
Your employees stage a walkout claiming

48:20.904 --> 48:23.782
Jocelyn's music's misogynistic
and you weren't scared?

48:23.865 --> 48:27.536
Walkout? Seventeen retards
and 200 journalists. That's a walkout?

48:27.619 --> 48:29.079
This whole fucking circus.

48:29.162 --> 48:32.040
I mean, it had to be worth,
what, like, 200 million

48:32.124 --> 48:33.708
-in free advertising.
-At least.

48:33.792 --> 48:36.128
No, "Fill The Void"
jumped 8,000% just that day.

48:36.211 --> 48:39.214
Nikki, when's the last time you sold out
the whole tour in three weeks?

48:39.297 --> 48:40.674
-Dude, I'm telling--
-Three weeks!

48:40.757 --> 48:42.050
Chaim, that's how we got the stadium.

48:42.134 --> 48:43.802
With all the fuckin' taarof,

48:43.885 --> 48:46.304
-it's actually a really inspiring story.
-Yeah.

48:46.388 --> 48:49.057
And most importantly, that psychopath

48:49.141 --> 48:50.684
-is out of our lives for good.
-Oh, yeah.

48:50.767 --> 48:53.979
-Got rid of him.
-Oh, my God. That fucking gonif.

48:54.062 --> 48:57.107
The fucking guy was like herpes.
We couldn't even fucking get rid of him.

48:57.190 --> 48:59.067
-Tell me about it.
-Do you know who fuckin' did it,

48:59.151 --> 49:01.236
-your fuckin'sniper Talia.
-That's right.

49:01.319 --> 49:02.696
That fuckin' "Vanity Fair" article...

49:02.779 --> 49:04.489
-Talia is hot.
-...took his ass out.

49:04.573 --> 49:06.032
-I love her.
-Dude, the quotes...

49:06.116 --> 49:08.410
-That's right.
-...from the hookers he used to pimp out.

49:08.493 --> 49:11.037
The one girl he used to fuckin--
I didn't think he had it in him.

49:11.121 --> 49:12.038
-Hi.
-Hi.

49:12.539 --> 49:14.624
My name is Tedros.

49:14.708 --> 49:18.462
I was wondering if Jocelyn
left an artist pass for me?

49:20.714 --> 49:22.048
Tedros.

49:23.550 --> 49:25.969
So, that's, that's T-E-D?

49:26.511 --> 49:29.139
-R-O-S.
-R-O-S?

49:30.891 --> 49:35.687
So, yeah, there's nothing on our end.
Could it be under a different name?

49:42.861 --> 49:44.529
Mauricio Jackson?

49:46.031 --> 49:48.617
-Mauricio Jackson.
-M-A-U--

49:52.829 --> 49:59.211
With the eyes of a big blue sea

49:59.294 --> 50:03.006
That's my family

50:03.090 --> 50:08.804
-Ooh
-That's my family

50:08.887 --> 50:11.890
I have something for Mauricio, so.

50:17.604 --> 50:20.023
You have a great night, Mr. Jackson.

50:23.485 --> 50:24.861
Thank you.

50:24.945 --> 50:27.197
-You know he lost his club?
-That fuckin' guy lost everything.

50:27.280 --> 50:28.407
Yeah, good. I mean, thank God

50:28.490 --> 50:30.242
-he lost his club.
-Even his rattail, they took.

50:31.701 --> 50:34.704
the thing is, he actually
has really great taste in music.

50:34.788 --> 50:36.581
I mean, look at all these
great artists he gave us.

50:36.665 --> 50:38.250
But you know what?
What's fucked up,

50:38.333 --> 50:40.669
he fuckin' sold out
this stadium in a weird way.

50:40.752 --> 50:42.712
So, maybe, you know,
we should send him a t-shirt.

50:44.464 --> 50:47.175
Fuckin' Holly saw a thing on "TMZ."
The IRS is goin' after him now.

50:47.259 --> 50:48.802
-Oh, yeah.
-For what, I don't know.

50:48.885 --> 50:52.222
But did you see the music video
he made in 2011?

50:52.305 --> 50:55.058
No, he was still rapping.

50:55.434 --> 50:57.811
The one he shot in the parking lot
of a Carl's Jr.?

50:57.894 --> 50:59.312
You know he was fuckin' working there.

50:59.396 --> 51:00.564
-Wait, Carl's Jr.?
-No.

51:00.647 --> 51:01.815
Employee of the month twice.

51:01.898 --> 51:03.233
No, stop it.

51:20.584 --> 51:22.002
I love Talia.

51:22.085 --> 51:24.713
But seriously,
that motherfucker was Keyser Soze.

51:24.796 --> 51:27.466
-How did she find that shit out about him?
-I don't know.

51:27.549 --> 51:29.468
She's a good journalist. I don't know.

51:29.551 --> 51:30.927
Yeah, Chaim.

51:31.011 --> 51:32.679
What do you want?

51:34.139 --> 51:35.974
Geez, don't look at me.

51:36.057 --> 51:39.227
What, you don't believe people can be
good journalists anymore?

51:39.728 --> 51:41.646
Very fuckin' cynical, even for you two.

51:42.355 --> 51:43.982
Tove me ode, Chaim.

51:44.566 --> 51:46.443
Tove me fuckin' ode.

51:46.526 --> 51:49.863
You guys, we ruined him.

51:53.533 --> 51:55.160
-Ruined.
-We fucking--

51:56.244 --> 51:58.288
We fuckin' ruined him.

52:01.416 --> 52:03.126
-Jocelyn's room?
-What's up, man?

52:03.210 --> 52:05.003
-What's goin' on, man?
-Yeah, what's up?

52:05.087 --> 52:06.505
Just here to see Jocelyn.

52:06.588 --> 52:08.673
-Who are you?
-Tedros.

52:08.757 --> 52:11.885
Tedros? Tedros who?

52:11.968 --> 52:13.386
Just Tedros. She knows me.

52:13.929 --> 52:15.680
Let me go check with Jocelyn.

52:22.771 --> 52:24.356
-She's expecting me.
-Yeah.

52:24.439 --> 52:26.650
-Yeah.
-I hear you, man.

52:26.733 --> 52:28.527
Look, man
I got the fuckin' artist pass here--

52:28.610 --> 52:30.987
-She said she never heard of you, man.
-What's that?

52:31.071 --> 52:33.698
-She said she never heard of you.
-Never heard of you.

52:33.782 --> 52:36.618
Said she ain't ever heard
that name Tetro before.

52:37.828 --> 52:40.831
Tetro, you gotta go.

52:44.626 --> 52:47.003
Aw, man. I'm fuckin' with you, man.
Go on up in there.

52:47.963 --> 52:49.423
-Go on up in there.
-You're okay, man.

52:49.506 --> 52:52.926
-Look at you.
-Do that little smooth walk you do, man.

52:53.009 --> 52:54.428
Dolemite.

52:55.846 --> 52:58.974
Hurry up, Don Juan.
Your suit blindin' me.

53:04.271 --> 53:05.480
Sit down.

53:17.451 --> 53:19.119
They put you through the wringer.

53:20.996 --> 53:21.997
Good.

53:23.248 --> 53:25.959
Listen,
I don't give a fuck about your past.

53:26.042 --> 53:28.170
I don't give a fuck about anybody's past.

53:28.253 --> 53:30.297
Let's call a spade a motherfuckin' spade.

53:30.380 --> 53:32.966
You are and were a pimp.

53:34.259 --> 53:35.761
It is what it is.

53:35.844 --> 53:37.846
We all gotta do
what we gotta do to survive.

53:37.929 --> 53:41.683
But the question is,
what are you going to do now?

53:42.976 --> 53:45.395
I am not like these other bitches.

53:45.479 --> 53:47.606
If you muff up

53:48.523 --> 53:50.776
and you hurt her

53:50.859 --> 53:56.948
I will hunt you down like
the motherfuckin' dog you are.

53:57.824 --> 53:59.659
And I will kill you.

54:01.870 --> 54:02.996
On God.

54:07.167 --> 54:09.086
Enjoy the motherfuckin' show.

54:54.047 --> 54:56.174
I'm really glad you came.

55:09.479 --> 55:13.108
-I missed you.
-I missed you, too.

55:16.319 --> 55:18.238
None of this means as much without you.

55:22.451 --> 55:24.870
I don't like being apart.

56:04.326 --> 56:06.745
Did you say this was the brush your mom
beat you with?

56:07.662 --> 56:09.081
I did.

56:20.133 --> 56:21.802
It's brand new.

58:38.313 --> 58:40.148
Hello, angels.

58:42.609 --> 58:46.363
I'm so happy to be here in LA.

58:46.446 --> 58:49.658
My home with all of you.

58:50.283 --> 58:52.202
My family.

58:52.285 --> 58:54.079
Jocelyn!

58:59.751 --> 59:00.669
Fuck yeah!

59:00.752 --> 59:02.796
I've had a tough year.

59:04.631 --> 59:08.051
This world can be a cruel
and unforgiving place.

59:08.593 --> 59:12.764
And there were moments when I didn't know
if I was gonna make it.

59:14.850 --> 59:19.271
But then I thought of you, and your grace.

59:22.649 --> 59:27.904
Tonight is incredibly special
because I have the opportunity

59:27.988 --> 59:30.615
to introduce you to the love of my life.

59:33.660 --> 59:35.495
Wait, what?

59:36.371 --> 59:39.708
The man who pulled me
through the darkest hours

59:40.375 --> 59:42.210
and into the light.

59:44.755 --> 59:46.173
Tedros,

59:50.719 --> 59:52.554
will you please join us?

59:53.513 --> 59:55.724
I want you to meet my family.

01:00:32.636 --> 01:00:35.639
You're mine, forever.

01:00:37.307 --> 01:00:39.518
Now go stand over there.

01:00:52.239 --> 01:00:54.074
That just happened, right?

01:00:54.157 --> 01:00:56.576
-How do we get rid of this fucker?
-How the fuck should I know?

01:00:56.993 --> 01:00:58.620
Fuckin' fuck!

01:01:37.617 --> 01:01:41.788
Mama taught her how to please

01:01:43.123 --> 01:01:46.752
Daddy begged them not to leave

01:01:46.835 --> 01:01:51.423
But they drove to the City of Angels

01:01:52.299 --> 01:01:57.304
Mama knows baby girl gonna be famous

01:01:58.930 --> 01:02:02.768
Mama died after fallen dream

01:02:04.144 --> 01:02:07.731
Suicide made her tabloid queen

01:02:07.814 --> 01:02:12.277
She's alone, the city gonna break her

01:02:13.570 --> 01:02:18.658
There's no one,
there's no one to save her

01:02:18.742 --> 01:02:23.497
Oh, he watches over like a god

01:02:25.165 --> 01:02:26.958
Makes you hurt again

01:02:27.375 --> 01:02:29.544
So you can heal and say amen

01:02:29.961 --> 01:02:34.091
We will change for you,
we will cry for you

01:02:34.841 --> 01:02:37.427
We will pay for you

Give our lives to you, oh-oh-oh

01:03:02.369 --> 01:03:05.622
Baby boy was doing petty crimes

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:11.002
Twenty-five, he was serving time

01:03:11.461 --> 01:03:16.299
He would dream of the City of Angels

01:03:16.383 --> 01:03:20.971
He was born to entertain us

01:03:21.054 --> 01:03:23.181
'tain us, 'tain us

01:03:23.473 --> 01:03:27.436
At his core, he's just a jealous guy

01:03:28.478 --> 01:03:32.482
Many woman fallin' for his lies

01:03:32.566 --> 01:03:34.443
He's alone

01:03:34.526 --> 01:03:37.696
The city gonna break him

01:03:37.779 --> 01:03:42.826
'Cause there's no one,
there's no one to save him

01:03:43.076 --> 01:03:43.994
Oh-oh-oh

01:03:44.077 --> 01:03:47.247

Oh-oh-oh

01:04:11.605 --> 01:04:15.192
