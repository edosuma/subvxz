35:00.791 --> 35:03.675
where I look at you
like you're nuts.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.543
I--okay, look.

35:05.679 --> 35:07.045
I've been doing some research,

35:07.180 --> 35:09.931
um, on Niffins.

35:10.050 --> 35:11.216

He's somewhere.

35:17.491 --> 35:18.607
Is there anything
in the literature that says

35:18.725 --> 35:20.108
that going Niffin is reversible?

35:20.227 --> 35:21.893
Nothing says that it isn't.

35:22.029 --> 35:23.895
Exactly.

35:24.031 --> 35:25.897
So I found this spell
that can transmutate

35:25.983 --> 35:29.401
certain meta-quantum energies
into matter...in theory.

35:29.536 --> 35:31.236

that this is crazy.
