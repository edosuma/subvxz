00:08.208 --> 00:09.916
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL LOVE STORY

00:15.333 --> 00:22.333
TWO MINUTES IN THE PRESENT
AND NINE MINUTES IN THE PAST

00:30.958 --> 00:32.750
Fine. The trip was nice.

00:33.916 --> 00:36.125
Yeah, I'm still a bit tired.

00:37.875 --> 00:39.041
Yeah, Nico's happy.

00:39.125 --> 00:42.000
You know him,
as long as there's a beach, he's happy.

00:44.875 --> 00:47.041
This week might be a bit hard, but

00:48.333 --> 00:50.291
I'll check and get back to you.

00:52.041 --> 00:52.958
Bye, Inés.

01:00.666 --> 01:01.791
Hi, Santi.

01:01.875 --> 01:03.208
Hi, Lina, how are you?

01:03.708 --> 01:04.541
I'm good.

01:05.416 --> 01:06.250
You look good.

01:06.750 --> 01:07.708
Did you come alone?

01:09.958 --> 01:10.791
Yeah.

01:12.750 --> 01:13.708
Unbelievable.

01:13.791 --> 01:15.958
You'll have to make a ton of trips.

01:20.250 --> 01:21.750
Hey, Lina. The thing is…

01:22.375 --> 01:24.208
I don't know. Life goes on, you know?

01:24.291 --> 01:25.291
This is everything.

01:27.541 --> 01:29.083
-This is the last one.
-Cool.

01:33.166 --> 01:34.250
So, how is he?

01:35.416 --> 01:37.333
Nico? Great, actually.

01:37.958 --> 01:40.916
He's cool.
He's keeping busy with his stuff.

01:42.250 --> 01:43.083
Like what?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.541
He's finally looking for work
in his field.

01:48.125 --> 01:49.000
Wow.

01:50.041 --> 01:52.916
So… congratulate him for me.

01:54.416 --> 01:55.250
Lina,

01:56.083 --> 01:57.250
just give it time.

01:58.875 --> 02:00.625
That's shitty advice, Santi.

02:12.625 --> 02:13.458
Hello?

02:14.083 --> 02:14.916
Hello.

02:19.291 --> 02:20.125
How are you?

02:20.625 --> 02:22.208
-How's it going?
-Good.

02:22.291 --> 02:23.625
I don't know.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.291
-I think it's going well.
-Yeah?

02:25.791 --> 02:27.333
I just hate cardiology.

02:28.250 --> 02:29.291
How are you?

02:29.375 --> 02:31.583
Good… I think I'm good.

02:34.666 --> 02:35.583
I hate this cap.

02:43.958 --> 02:45.166
I smell like chlorine.

02:45.250 --> 02:47.500
You don't smell like chlorine.
Stop obsessing.

02:48.333 --> 02:49.916
You're home early today.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.583
Yeah, no one came to the 8:00 class.
People don't go to the pool in the summer.

02:58.458 --> 03:00.375
-Keep at it. I'm going to shower.
-Okay.

03:00.458 --> 03:02.458
I'll cook dinner.
How much do you have left?

03:02.541 --> 03:03.708
All of this.

03:03.791 --> 03:05.166
Come on, you can do it.

03:14.458 --> 03:15.458
Hey, Lina!

03:16.458 --> 03:19.416
I was thinking…
Have you seen that thing I had…?

03:21.083 --> 03:22.291
-Shower time!
-No!

03:22.375 --> 03:24.791
-It's shower time!
-I already showered!

03:24.875 --> 03:26.791
So shower again. Back to the shower!

03:28.208 --> 03:29.250
Now's the time…

03:29.333 --> 03:30.166
One.

03:30.875 --> 03:35.083
The atrioventricular valves
are mitral and tricuspid.

03:36.125 --> 03:37.791
And two… Don't laugh at me.

03:39.041 --> 03:41.875
Sigmoid. Sigmoid valves, or…

03:43.458 --> 03:44.333
Hold on.

03:45.083 --> 03:48.125
-Or semilunar valves.
-"Semilunar," what a pretty word.

03:48.208 --> 03:51.166
Those are… pulmonary and aortic.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.250
Nice. Sounds good to me.

03:56.583 --> 03:57.958
When do you work tomorrow?

03:58.583 --> 04:01.458
I've got a class
with the kids in the morning.

04:02.541 --> 04:05.625
Then I've got the old folks
in the evening, until 8:00.

04:06.916 --> 04:09.041
-What about Sunday?
-I work Sunday morning.

04:10.458 --> 04:11.291
What's up?

04:13.666 --> 04:16.833
What's going on
in this little head of yours?

04:16.916 --> 04:17.791
What's up?

04:18.833 --> 04:22.333
There's this place on my way back
from class that I want to go to.

04:22.958 --> 04:25.208
With you. But we never see each other.

04:25.875 --> 04:26.708
Right.

04:29.708 --> 04:30.625
Then we'll go.

04:32.583 --> 04:34.125
Next time we see each other.

04:35.416 --> 04:36.916
We're seeing each other now.

04:37.416 --> 04:38.708
A little water…

04:46.625 --> 04:48.458
-We'll miss it.
-I'm going to trip.

04:48.541 --> 04:49.708
We're going to miss it.

04:50.708 --> 04:51.750
Hurry up. Come on!

04:52.416 --> 04:53.375
I'm out of breath.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.083
Come on.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.208
I won't forget this.

05:11.041 --> 05:11.875
Yeah.

05:21.416 --> 05:24.166
So this is where everybody sneaks in.

05:25.291 --> 05:26.208
Looks like it.

05:28.875 --> 05:29.708
I'll go first.

05:32.083 --> 05:33.833
It's not an electric fence, is it?

05:35.250 --> 05:36.458
Careful with this.

05:36.541 --> 05:37.375
Okay.

05:41.791 --> 05:42.791
Whoops!

05:43.291 --> 05:45.250
Are you seriously wearing flip-flops?

05:45.333 --> 05:46.625
This is a water park.

05:46.708 --> 05:48.250
Yeah, but we're sneaking in.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.458
-Quiet, we could get caught.
-Too late.

05:51.541 --> 05:52.833
-What?
-I mean it.

05:52.916 --> 05:53.750
Seriously?

05:54.375 --> 05:55.208
No.

05:56.458 --> 05:57.583
You jerk!

05:58.208 --> 05:59.375
Look, there's a map.

06:03.875 --> 06:05.333
I want to go to Niagara. You?

06:05.416 --> 06:06.875
I want to go to

06:07.875 --> 06:08.750
the anaconda.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.291
-All right.
-Okay.

06:11.791 --> 06:12.666
Which way is it?

06:13.166 --> 06:15.416
I think it might be that way, right?

06:19.416 --> 06:20.250
That's mine.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.500
And I'm stealing it.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.416
Come here, little one. Come to daddy.

06:26.458 --> 06:27.291
Wait.

06:29.083 --> 06:31.500
-So this was your plan all along.
-Yeah.

06:31.583 --> 06:32.625
This game of

06:33.625 --> 06:34.958
fishing for crocodiles.

06:36.416 --> 06:38.416
-Whoa!
-You're pink and I'm green.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.333
Okay.

06:42.000 --> 06:42.833
Hey!

06:45.208 --> 06:48.750
I'm the king of the crocs

06:50.500 --> 06:54.500
-How many do you have?
-I'm not saying. We'll do a recount later.

06:55.458 --> 06:56.375
Another one.

06:57.750 --> 06:58.750
You're winning.

06:59.708 --> 07:03.250
Come on, little ones,
we have to beat this girl.

07:06.333 --> 07:07.708
I don't ask for much.

07:08.500 --> 07:12.791
All I need is a pond to float on
and an inflatable doughnut.

07:12.875 --> 07:13.875
But under the sun.

07:15.041 --> 07:16.000
Sunshine's a must.

07:18.625 --> 07:20.708
You can't get away from me.

07:28.458 --> 07:31.250
I'm thinking of applying
for a scholarship to study abroad.

07:37.000 --> 07:37.833
How come?

07:39.291 --> 07:40.125
Where?

07:41.291 --> 07:42.625
There's a bunch of places.

07:43.541 --> 07:44.375
Verona,

07:45.333 --> 07:46.583
Manchester, London,

07:47.583 --> 07:49.000
Bologna, Milan…

07:53.250 --> 07:54.250
Where do you prefer?

07:55.375 --> 07:56.708
London, I think.

07:58.458 --> 07:59.291
That way,

08:00.583 --> 08:01.750
I'll learn English.

08:03.708 --> 08:04.541
Right.

09:01.625 --> 09:02.791
This is nice.

09:07.958 --> 09:10.125
It's as if the sea were right there.

09:17.833 --> 09:18.666
Hey, Lina…

09:21.875 --> 09:25.291
Earlier, when you said
that thing about going abroad…

09:28.583 --> 09:31.500
I wanted to tell you that…
I moved here for you.

09:33.541 --> 09:36.125
It's not that I don't want you to go, but

09:37.916 --> 09:40.250
I looked for a job here to be with you.

09:40.875 --> 09:42.000
It didn't just happen.

09:52.583 --> 09:54.208
I thought it wasn't only for me.

09:55.833 --> 09:56.791
You moving here.

09:59.583 --> 10:01.041
I thought you wanted to.

10:01.125 --> 10:03.125
It doesn't matter. Don't worry about it.

10:09.291 --> 10:10.208
But if I leave,

10:11.541 --> 10:12.666
what would you do?

10:15.291 --> 10:17.208
I don't know. What do you want?

10:20.083 --> 10:21.333
I asked you first.

10:53.291 --> 10:55.500
There are inflatable doughnuts
in London too.

10:58.083 --> 10:58.958
If you want.

11:20.500 --> 11:21.333
Inés.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.375
I have to tell you something.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.750
THIS SERIES IS A WORK OF FICTION.
ANY SIMILARITY IS COINCIDENTAL.
