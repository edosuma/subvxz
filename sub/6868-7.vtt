WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:03.548
Oh, God.

00:03.668 --> 00:07.337
ARCHER: Ugh, no, forget the glass,
Woodhouse, just gimme the pitcher...

00:07.689 --> 00:10.528
For I am a sinner in the
hands of an angry God.

00:10.530 --> 00:14.142
Bloody Mary, full of vodka, blessed
are you among cocktails...

00:14.144 --> 00:20.123
Pray for me, now and at the hour of
my death, which I hope is soon, amen.

00:20.125 --> 00:26.806
WOODHOUSE: Er, perhaps a coddled egg...
ARCHER: No. No eggs, Woodhouse.

00:26.808 --> 00:28.076
Maybe ever again.

00:28.078 --> 00:29.545
WOODHOUSE: Some dry toast?

00:29.547 --> 00:31.846
ARCHER: Yeah, or you could skip a
step and just feed me some vomit.

00:31.848 --> 00:34.652
WOODHOUSE: Not like you
to get a hangover, sir.

00:34.654 --> 00:36.153
ARCHER: Yeah, I don't
know what happened.

00:36.155 --> 00:41.959
I kinda remember being at the wake...
MALORY: Oh, you poor dear.

00:41.961 --> 00:45.563
On behalf of his fellow ISIS agents,
please let me be the first to

00:45.565 --> 00:47.330
offer my condolences.

00:47.332 --> 00:52.368
ARCHER: And let me be the first to
welcome you back into the dating pool.

00:52.370 --> 00:55.638
(burp) And-or-also my
new, hic, hot tub.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.775
But after that it's just... snippets.

00:57.777 --> 01:01.913
I think I had one more drink there...
EVERYBODY: Drink, drink, drink, drink!

01:01.915 --> 01:07.753
ARCHER: And then I think I took a cab...
Hang on, wait, lemme see some hands!

01:07.755 --> 01:11.056
Who wants chicken and waffles?!

01:11.058 --> 01:13.325
How did we bring food in here?!

01:13.327 --> 01:15.728
Oh, and also, did we
lose some people?!

01:15.730 --> 01:17.830
PAM: Lana'n Cyril bailed!

01:17.832 --> 01:19.299
Triflin bitches!

01:19.301 --> 01:23.036
Here! Less yer a triflin bitch too!

01:23.038 --> 01:26.606
ARCHER: Agh!
What'd I just put inside me?!

01:26.608 --> 01:27.774
PAM: Green Russians!

01:27.776 --> 01:33.380
It's absinthe and...
Milk, sweet shitsnacks lookit those!

01:33.382 --> 01:35.750
ARCHER: Oh! My! God!

01:35.752 --> 01:36.651
That's right!

01:36.653 --> 01:39.956
It's somewhat coming back to me!

01:39.958 --> 01:40.824
PAM: Woooo!

01:40.826 --> 01:42.293
I'm Pacman Jones!

01:42.295 --> 01:43.895
ARCHER: Come home with me!

01:43.897 --> 01:46.965
Plus my valet will
give you some heroin!

01:46.967 --> 01:49.834
WOODHOUSE: Thankfully I
didn't have to share.

01:49.836 --> 01:51.704
ARCHER: But she did,
she came home with me!

01:51.706 --> 01:52.372
I remember!

01:52.374 --> 01:55.575
I mean, Green Russians, it's
fuzzy, I don't remember this...

01:55.577 --> 01:59.346
But I do remember her being the
best sex I've ever had in my life!

01:59.348 --> 02:02.150
WOODHOUSE: Er --
ARCHER: Shut up, and that includes Europe, Lana,

02:07.291 --> 02:07.989
WOODHOUSE: Sir...?

02:07.991 --> 02:08.889
ARCHER: Phone number?!

02:08.892 --> 02:09.390
Matchbook?!

02:09.393 --> 02:12.928
I don't know her name, where she works...
Woodhouse, how am I gonna find her?!

02:12.930 --> 02:13.896
WOODHOUSE: Ahem.

02:13.898 --> 02:15.531
You might check the loo.

02:15.533 --> 02:16.465
ARCHER: What, here?!

02:16.467 --> 02:17.799
Why didn't you say so?!

02:17.801 --> 02:19.067
WOODHOUSE: Oww!

02:19.069 --> 02:20.903
ARCHER: Oww!

02:20.905 --> 02:27.142
Ow, ow, ow... Uh, so hey, hi.

02:27.144 --> 02:31.413
I'm Sterling Archer, you may
remember me from the strip club,

02:31.415 --> 02:34.417
and hopefully also from what was
hands down the most incredible

02:34.419 --> 02:37.520
sex that I personally have ever had.

02:37.522 --> 02:45.597
Hello? Oh right, so I know we had an
implied oral agreement about heroin...

02:45.599 --> 02:46.464
PAM: Heroin?!

02:46.466 --> 02:47.098
ARCHER: Wh-?!

02:47.100 --> 02:50.535
PAM: That's the last
frickin thing I need.

02:50.537 --> 02:53.372
I'm bound up tighter'n dick's hatband.

02:53.374 --> 02:57.576
ARCHER: No, not...
were you...? Did we...?

02:57.578 --> 02:58.744
PAM: Yeah, we did.

02:58.746 --> 02:59.978
And you loved it!

02:59.980 --> 03:02.314
ARCHER: [incoherent gibberish]

03:02.316 --> 03:04.450
KATHUMP!

PAM: Okay, jeez, I get it!

03:41.762 --> 03:43.620
ARCHER: Well, you say that, but
I worry that you think I'm

03:43.622 --> 03:47.924
exaggerating when I say...
PAM: That I was the best sex you ever had?

03:47.926 --> 03:52.629
ARCHER: No... That if anybody ever finds
out about it, I will literally -

03:52.749 --> 03:55.566
Pam, look at me-
I will literally murder you.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.036
PAM: Not literally...
ARCHER: Yes literally!

03:58.038 --> 04:00.872
You will wake up in three
separate fifty-gallon drums!

04:00.874 --> 04:03.641
PAM: That's a hundred
and fifty gallons.

04:03.643 --> 04:08.979
Of Pam's hot, dirty, ball-slappiney...
ARCHER: Gaaghh!

04:08.981 --> 04:12.215
PAM: Come at me bro!

04:12.217 --> 04:18.422
How ya gonna keep 'em, down on the
farm, after they seen Pam-ee?

04:18.423 --> 04:22.894
ARCHER: Yeah, how're you gonna...
I mean, my God, you can't,

04:22.896 --> 04:25.363
that, that was just --
MALORY: Disgusting!

04:25.365 --> 04:28.900
And I hoped I would never have to say
this, but you finally topped your

04:28.902 --> 04:30.803
tenth grade sports banquet!

04:30.805 --> 04:34.840
ARCHER: I -- okay first of all,
Mrs. Coach Mumford came on to me.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.243
And second of all...
what're we talking about?

04:37.245 --> 04:39.912
MALORY: Hitting on your
dead colleague's widow?!

04:39.914 --> 04:41.147
At his own wake?!

04:41.149 --> 04:42.482
ARCHER: Oh, that.

04:42.484 --> 04:45.852
- Okay, so...
- So help me God, Sterling, sometimes I think

04:45.854 --> 04:48.288
that I've failed as a mother.

04:48.290 --> 04:49.322
ARCHER: Sometimes?

04:49.324 --> 04:52.125
MALORY: Oh shut up, and the last
thing you need is another drink.

04:52.127 --> 04:55.862
LANA: Ugh, seriously, how can you
be drinking after last night?

04:55.864 --> 04:56.763
ARCHER: How can you not?

04:56.765 --> 04:59.566
LANA: Because I don't have a problem.

04:59.568 --> 05:02.904
MALORY: Well, I do...
ARCHER: First step's admitting it, Mother.

05:02.906 --> 05:03.538
MALORY: Wh-?

05:03.540 --> 05:04.672
Not with drinking!

05:04.674 --> 05:08.343
ARCHER: Eh... LANA: Eh...
MALORY: My problem, besides your snide remarks

05:08.345 --> 05:11.080
is Nikolai Jakov, head of the KGB.

05:11.082 --> 05:13.416
LANA: And also possibly
Archer's father.

05:13.418 --> 05:13.950
ARCHER: Wh-?

05:13.952 --> 05:15.718
MALORY: How do you know about that?!

05:15.720 --> 05:17.287
LANA: Because I'm part of Everybody?

05:17.289 --> 05:20.356
MALORY: Damn that blabbermouthing Pam...
ARCHER: Why, what'd she say?!

05:20.358 --> 05:24.828
Besides the stuff about Jakov, which
obviously is what you meant, so...

05:24.830 --> 05:27.831
MALORY: So, Nikolai has been dropping
hints that he may want to defect.

05:27.833 --> 05:28.498
ARCHER: What?!

05:28.500 --> 05:29.199
LANA: That's awesome!

05:29.201 --> 05:30.767
MALORY: I think you mean awful.

05:30.769 --> 05:33.470
LANA: Uh, ISIS getting an
inside look at every single

05:33.472 --> 05:35.305
KGB operation in the world?

05:35.307 --> 05:36.507
And that's awful how?

05:36.509 --> 05:39.577
MALORY: Because he thinks he's
going to move in with me!

05:39.579 --> 05:42.613
Me, who happens to be in a
relationship with Burt Reynolds,

05:42.615 --> 05:44.548
in case you've forgotten?

05:44.550 --> 05:46.183
ARCHER: I actually did forget that.

05:46.185 --> 05:47.952
LANA: Yeah, I never see you together.

05:47.954 --> 05:49.787
I mean, are you like dating, or...?

05:49.789 --> 05:51.155
MALORY: It's... complicated.

05:51.157 --> 05:56.060
What with our work schedules, and...
work, it's hard to find time

05:56.062 --> 05:57.394
for actual dates.

05:57.396 --> 06:01.532
LANA: But you do see one another...
MALORY: Well yes of course, but --

06:01.534 --> 06:03.100
ARCHER: But never in public, right?

06:03.102 --> 06:07.038
Only at your place, or maybe a hotel, or...
PAM: Or on the dirty floor in

06:07.040 --> 06:08.039
the elevator?

06:08.041 --> 06:09.274
MALORY: Wh-? Pam!

06:09.276 --> 06:14.079
Get your bloated carcass --
ARCHER: Out, I got it, I'm on this I got it!

06:14.081 --> 06:16.214
MALORY: How did she know
about the elevator?

06:16.216 --> 06:17.215
LANA: I -- ew.

06:17.217 --> 06:19.785
MALORY: Burt made sure I
erased the security tape.

06:19.787 --> 06:25.723
Wait, could -- you don't think
Burt's ashamed to be seen with me?

06:25.725 --> 06:26.390
Lana.

06:26.392 --> 06:27.225
LANA: I'm sorry?

06:27.227 --> 06:30.394
ARCHER: Well I'm sorry, but if anybody
ever found out I'd die of shame!

06:30.396 --> 06:33.364
PAM: Well how do ya think
that makes me feel?!

06:33.366 --> 06:35.832
ARCHER: I don't care Pam!

06:35.834 --> 06:37.869
Now, having said that, would
you please come in this

06:37.871 --> 06:40.238
dirty toilet stall and
have sex with me.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.574
PAM: Ugh, oh alright!

06:42.576 --> 06:44.276
But this time get in there.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.511
All ya been doin' is givin'

06:45.513 --> 06:46.946
one side hell.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.282
BARRY: Well, when you put it like
that it sounds kinda shitty.

06:49.284 --> 06:53.252
JAKOV: Thirty years of my
life I giff to the KGB?!

06:53.254 --> 06:56.989
End now you, this, this
traitorous cyborg?!

06:56.991 --> 06:58.958
Are seeting et my desk?!

06:58.960 --> 07:00.326
How would you put it?!

07:00.328 --> 07:03.095
BARRY: Yeah, you really
got cornholed, huh?

07:03.097 --> 07:06.531
Wait, don't answer yet, because I'm
also reassigning you to Siberia.

07:06.533 --> 07:07.899
JAKOV: Wh-?! Siberia?!

07:07.901 --> 07:10.502
BARRY: Barry can't have you
moping around here, you know...

07:10.504 --> 07:12.771
sowing the discontent!

07:12.773 --> 07:13.972
BORIS: Is bad for morale.

07:13.974 --> 07:15.940
JAKOV: Et tu, Brute?!

07:15.942 --> 07:17.375
BORIS: Et me, buddy.

07:17.377 --> 07:18.109
JAKOV: Rrrrrgh!

07:18.111 --> 07:19.944
BARRY: So here's my advice
to you: dress in layers.

07:19.946 --> 07:24.282
And don't even think about doing
anything crazy like defecting...

07:24.284 --> 07:25.984
JAKOV: I would never defect!

07:25.986 --> 07:27.686
I love Mother Russia!

07:27.688 --> 07:31.089
BARRY: Even when you're chopping through
the ice in the toilet so you can poop?

07:31.091 --> 07:33.091
I'm kidding, obviously.

07:33.093 --> 07:36.195
You'll be like, six hundred
miles from a toilet.

07:36.197 --> 07:38.397
ARCHER: Sorry, had to go to the
bathroom, nothing unusual,

07:38.399 --> 07:42.268
just uh, you know, normal,
um, bodily waste excretion.

07:42.270 --> 07:44.770
MALORY: If you're quite finished...
ARCHER: Damn near.

07:44.772 --> 07:48.374
MALORY:... then go home, sober up, and
make sure your apartment is secure.

07:48.376 --> 07:49.542
ARCHER: Uh, why?

07:49.544 --> 07:50.543
To all three of those?

07:50.545 --> 07:52.946
MALORY: Because if and when
Nikolai shows up here,

07:52.948 --> 07:56.650
he's not staying at my place...
ARCHER: Well, he's not staying with me!

07:56.652 --> 07:58.218
MALORY: Then go prep the safehouse.

07:58.220 --> 08:02.255
Because you can bet every KGB
agent and freelance assassin

08:02.257 --> 08:06.660
this side of Berlin will be
hunting him down like a dog.

08:06.662 --> 08:07.728
ARCHER: Who hunts dogs?

08:07.730 --> 08:10.799
CHERYL/CAROL: Orientals, duh!

08:12.041 --> 08:16.644
BARRY: So when you say you assume
Jakov got on that train to Siberia,

08:16.646 --> 08:17.612
you know what you're doing?

08:17.614 --> 08:18.826
BORIS: I mek you ess.

08:18.946 --> 08:20.984
BARRY: And Barry doesn't like!

08:22.251 --> 08:24.651
Being made an ass, he really doesn't.

08:24.653 --> 08:28.589
And as you can -- well it's over there
now, but the telex from the Siberia

08:28.591 --> 08:31.149
desk says Jakov never showed up!

08:31.269 --> 08:33.294
Now why do you think that might be?!

08:33.296 --> 08:36.296
BORIS: Ummm...
JAKOV: Thenk you, Boris!

08:36.298 --> 08:38.732
I wun't forget this!

08:38.734 --> 08:42.202
BORIS: I promised myself I don't cry.

08:42.203 --> 08:44.102
Promise broke.

08:44.105 --> 08:46.038
BARRY: What was that?

08:46.040 --> 08:47.173
BORIS: Ellergies?

08:47.175 --> 08:51.710
BARRY: To what, making sure
people get on trains?!

08:51.712 --> 08:53.378
Nice one other Barry.

08:53.380 --> 08:57.715
Now Jakov's got a twelve-hour head start,
and the details of every single

08:57.717 --> 09:01.318
KGB operation on the globe in
his fat, combed-over head!

09:01.320 --> 09:04.087
BORIS: Da, end we hef
no idea where he went!

09:04.089 --> 09:05.956
BARRY: Well I assume he's
in New York, with those

09:05.958 --> 09:08.124
shitbitchingassbastard Archers!

09:08.126 --> 09:09.492
BORIS: But...
BARRY: I can assume!

09:09.494 --> 09:11.595
You're already an ass!

09:11.597 --> 09:15.566
So contact our sleeper in New York and
then cancel all my meetings this week,

09:15.568 --> 09:18.136
because I will also be in New York.

09:18.138 --> 09:20.005
Murdering people.

09:20.007 --> 09:22.174
JAKOV: Eh, dunt tek this the wrung way?

09:22.176 --> 09:26.612
But I pictured you
having nicer apartment.

09:26.614 --> 09:27.580
[Laughter]

09:27.582 --> 09:29.049
Why thet is funny?

09:29.051 --> 09:32.853
MALORY: Hm? Oh no, sorry, there's
a funny Marmaduke on the fridge.

09:32.855 --> 09:33.454
JAKOV: A what?

09:33.456 --> 09:38.226
MALORY: And this is actually,
ahem, the ISIS safehouse, cheers!

09:38.228 --> 09:39.228
JAKOV: Safehouse?

09:39.230 --> 09:42.765
But Melory, I assumed...
MALORY: Which you shouldn't have!

09:42.767 --> 09:46.569
What, you thought you'd just show up out
of the blue and we'd move in together?

09:46.571 --> 09:48.704
JAKOV: Pretty much, yeah.

09:48.706 --> 09:53.676
MALORY: Nikolai, it's not that I don't-
am not very fond of you, I mean,

09:53.678 --> 09:58.481
we have such history together, and...
JAKOV: End mebbe a son?

09:58.483 --> 10:02.050
MALORY: Mmmmaybe, but...
JAKOV: But so?

10:02.052 --> 10:03.184
Where is he?

10:03.186 --> 10:04.552
LANA: Good question.

10:04.554 --> 10:07.121
He was supposed to prep this dump...
GILLETTE: And didn't.

10:07.123 --> 10:09.523
LANA: -- and now he's supposed to be
here for the first shift of guard duty.

10:09.525 --> 10:10.424
CYRIL: And isn't.

10:10.426 --> 10:14.093
JAKOV: Uh -- LANA: Hi, Lana Kane, you
must be Major Jakov, such a pleasure,

10:14.095 --> 10:17.096
be a lamb and take
those to the kitchen?

10:17.098 --> 10:17.463
So.

10:17.465 --> 10:20.199
I think I speak for all of us
when I say we shouldn't be the

10:20.201 --> 10:22.435
only ones guarding
your maybe-baby-daddy.

10:22.437 --> 10:28.174
MALORY: I can't believe you all know about that...
JAKOV: Wow, thet is big dog!

10:28.176 --> 10:29.008
MALORY: Marmaduke.

10:29.010 --> 10:32.078
And regardless of any...
personal ties I may have with Nikolai,

10:32.080 --> 10:35.081
he's a invaluable asset and
we have to protect him!

10:35.083 --> 10:38.619
I mean, you know...
at least until he's been debriefed.

10:38.621 --> 10:39.386
LANA: And then?

10:39.388 --> 10:41.321
What, he's on his own?

10:41.323 --> 10:44.125
MALORY: Um...
LANA: Wow.

10:44.127 --> 10:46.960
ARCHER: I'm serious, you are literally
draining the life out of me.

10:46.962 --> 10:51.899
PAM: C'mon, you make me sound like some kinda...
chupacabra, but for dicks.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.869
ARCHER: A terrifying yet
accurate comparison.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.237
Where did you learn all that stuff?

10:56.239 --> 10:59.240
PAM: You know I grew
up on a farm, right?

10:59.242 --> 11:01.643
ARCHER: Really hoping
that's not relevant.

11:01.645 --> 11:04.645
WOODHOUSE: Ms. Kane... and your mother.

11:04.647 --> 11:06.047
ARCHER: Hooray...
PAM: I gotta bounce.

11:06.049 --> 11:07.315
Later taters.

11:07.317 --> 11:10.519
ARCHER: Lana listen, if this is a
booty call, I'm flattered, but --

11:10.521 --> 11:11.220
LANA: Oh my God.

11:11.222 --> 11:12.888
MALORY: You're supposed
to be guarding Nikolai!

11:12.890 --> 11:17.093
ARCHER: Yeah, so about that, I mean, don't
you think that's gonna be..kinda...

11:17.095 --> 11:19.963
JAKOV: [sniffling, weeping]

11:19.965 --> 11:20.797
ARCHER: Awkward?

11:20.799 --> 11:22.499
CYRIL: I actually think
it's kinda sweet.

11:22.501 --> 11:23.233
ARCHER: Little help?

11:23.235 --> 11:24.001
LANA: No, you're good.

11:24.003 --> 11:26.603
The camera's set up for the debriefing,
and one of us will relieve you

11:26.605 --> 11:28.038
in like, eight hours?

11:28.040 --> 11:29.440
ARCHER: Wait, where
are you guys going?!

11:29.442 --> 11:30.874
GILLETTE: Uh, a town called work?

11:30.876 --> 11:34.345
LANA: Neutralizing a KGB sleeper in
Brooklyn, thanks to this intel from the

11:34.347 --> 11:35.012
major.

11:35.014 --> 11:36.947
JAKOV: It was least I could do.

11:36.949 --> 11:39.083
LANA: Since otherwise he'd kill you?

11:39.085 --> 11:40.417
JAKOV: Is win-win.

11:40.419 --> 11:45.022
LANA: Is it?

11:45.024 --> 11:46.990
JAKOV: So!

11:46.992 --> 11:47.857
ARCHER: Yeah.

11:47.859 --> 11:49.526
JAKOV: Sterlink!

11:49.528 --> 11:50.360
ARCHER: Yeah.

11:50.362 --> 11:51.661
JAKOV: Is long time.

11:51.663 --> 11:55.064
ARCHER: Yeah, when was... oh!
I guess when I was in the

11:55.066 --> 12:00.303
dreaded Lubyanka with jumper
cables clamped to my balls!

12:00.305 --> 12:05.307
JAKOV: So <i>da</i>, this is...
a little awkward.

12:05.309 --> 12:06.308
ARCHER: Yeah.

12:06.310 --> 12:07.309
JAKOV: Maybe some shots?

12:07.311 --> 12:09.512
ARCHER: Yeah let's try that!

12:09.514 --> 12:16.118
LANA: Any time now... Cyril. Cyril!

12:16.120 --> 12:19.222
CYRIL: Lana, I -- I don't
think I'm cut out for this.

12:19.224 --> 12:22.524
LANA: Well, don't take this the wrong
way, but neither does anyone else.

12:22.526 --> 12:24.360
Just pretend he's, like, a rabid dog.

12:24.362 --> 12:26.429
CYRIL: Oh God, just like Old Yeller!

12:26.431 --> 12:30.699
GILLETTE: Yeah, if Old Yeller had a big
stack of KGB codebooks and fif - forty

12:30.701 --> 12:32.501
thousand bucks in a floor safe.

12:32.503 --> 12:35.971
LANA: And was also identified as a
sleeper agent by the head of the KGB!

12:35.973 --> 12:37.172
KGB AGENT: Who, Barry?!

12:37.174 --> 12:37.773
LANA: What?

12:37.775 --> 12:38.507
KGB AGENT: White?

12:38.509 --> 12:39.608
You guys like smooth R&B?

12:39.610 --> 12:40.108
GILLETTE: Duh.

12:40.110 --> 12:46.147
LANA: Are you telling me Barry "The Bionic
Douchebag" Dylan is running the KGB?

12:46.149 --> 12:47.749
KGB AGENT: Only if I can defect, too.

12:47.751 --> 12:50.352
Because that dude is
out of his damn mind.

12:50.354 --> 12:51.854
LANA: I'm listening.

12:51.856 --> 12:53.121
KGB AGENT: He's crazy!

12:53.123 --> 12:57.559
I mean he's smart, way smarter than Jakov,
but -- oh, and you can bet Jakov's

12:57.561 --> 12:58.627
intel is bad!

12:58.629 --> 12:59.261
LANA: Really?

12:59.263 --> 13:00.396
This isn't your kneecap?

13:00.398 --> 13:01.630
KGB AGENT: Don't you get it?

13:01.632 --> 13:04.600
Barry gave me up so you'd
trust Jakov on the rest!

13:04.602 --> 13:09.171
He knew Jakov wanted to defect, so...
LANA: So he's been feeding him fake intel?

13:09.173 --> 13:10.372
KGB AGENT: I mean I assume!

13:10.374 --> 13:13.041
Because Barry's got a master
plan, which, when you hear it,

13:13.043 --> 13:18.245
will probably make your head explo...
LANA: Jesus! GILLETTE: Jesus!

13:18.247 --> 13:19.279
LANA: Ahem. Cyril?

13:19.281 --> 13:20.447
CYRIL: I'm sorry!

13:20.449 --> 13:21.815
LANA: Yes.

13:21.817 --> 13:23.484
Yes you are.

13:23.486 --> 13:25.653
JAKOV: Is I who em sorry!

13:25.655 --> 13:28.055
I should hef been there for you!

13:28.057 --> 13:33.994
ARCHER: Shut up, don't do that, I mean
what were you gonna do, marry my mother?

13:33.996 --> 13:35.262
Have you met her?

13:35.264 --> 13:35.762
Oww!

13:35.764 --> 13:39.132
JAKOV: Dun't you ever disrespect her!

13:39.134 --> 13:42.936
ARCHER: You're not my dad!

13:42.938 --> 13:45.172
[Laughter]

13:45.174 --> 13:47.741
JAKOV: How would you know?!

13:47.743 --> 13:49.209
ARCHER: I know, right?!

13:49.211 --> 13:53.481
JAKOV: But I hef to say,
you dun't look like me!

13:53.483 --> 13:57.619
ARCHER: And don't take this the
wrong way, but thank Christ!

13:57.621 --> 13:58.620
Oww!

13:58.622 --> 13:59.521
CHERYL/CAROL: Watch it!

13:59.523 --> 14:00.055
You dumb idiot!

14:00.057 --> 14:01.089
BARRY: Oh man, I am so sorry!

14:01.091 --> 14:04.760
Here, lemme get you some...
oh my God, Cheryl?

14:04.762 --> 14:06.061
CHERYL/CAROL: Barry?!

14:06.063 --> 14:08.597
BARRY: Wow, I was hoping
I'd bump into you!

14:08.599 --> 14:09.431
CHERYL/CAROL: Wait, really?

14:09.433 --> 14:11.266
BARRY: And darn if I didn't!

14:11.268 --> 14:11.934
Literally!

14:11.936 --> 14:15.237
CHERYL/CAROL: You -- wait a minute, why
am I thinking you live in like, Russia?

14:15.239 --> 14:17.206
BARRY: Mmmmaybe the tracksuit?

14:17.208 --> 14:20.476
CHERYL/CAROL: Duh, right, and which, by
the way, you are totally rockiiiing.

14:20.478 --> 14:24.446
BARRY: Oh, that's just...
my huge muscles.

14:24.448 --> 14:27.649
CHERYL/CAROL: So tell me...
how strong are you?

14:27.651 --> 14:29.917
BARRY: Insanely, wanna get outta here?

14:29.919 --> 14:31.485
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh my God, totally,
but like it has to be

14:31.487 --> 14:33.854
your place, because mine
reeks of ocelot piss.

14:33.856 --> 14:37.723
BARRY: I have no response to that...
CHERYL/CAROL: Doesn't merit one.

14:37.725 --> 14:41.526
BARRY:... and my place is currently flooding so...
CHERYL/CAROL: Hotel?

14:41.528 --> 14:42.861
BARRY: Damn, no money.

14:42.863 --> 14:44.329
Tracksuit, no pockets.

14:44.331 --> 14:45.130
CHERYL/CAROL: Damn it!

14:45.132 --> 14:47.666
BARRY: I know, it's the
one single drawback.

14:47.668 --> 14:50.368
Wait, doesn't ISIS have a safehouse?

14:50.370 --> 14:52.904
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, but...
You have promise that all that

14:52.906 --> 14:56.107
horrific stuff I think I remember
about you is just false memories?

14:56.109 --> 14:58.309
BARRY: I...
CHERYL/CAROL: Because I get those a lot.

14:58.311 --> 15:01.279
BARRY: Cross the microchip in my heart.

15:01.281 --> 15:03.447
CHERYL/CAROL: Don't
get all girly on me.

15:03.449 --> 15:04.515
Check!

15:06.057 --> 15:07.098
MALORY: Hold the door!

15:07.218 --> 15:08.371
Hold the door!

15:08.556 --> 15:09.855
PAM: Headin out?

15:09.857 --> 15:13.392
MALORY: No, I thought I'd just take all
my things for a ride on the elevator.

15:13.394 --> 15:14.493
PAM: Okay.

15:14.495 --> 15:16.162
MALORY: I actually have a date.

15:16.164 --> 15:17.396
With Burt Reynolds.

15:17.398 --> 15:18.665
We're watching Gator.

15:18.667 --> 15:19.532
PAM: Your place?

15:19.534 --> 15:23.536
MALORY: Well if we go out, you
know, he's just mobbed, so...

15:23.538 --> 15:27.440
PAM: So it's a DVD, a box of wine and
some Hot Pockets, and off to bed.

15:27.442 --> 15:27.974
MALORY: No!

15:27.976 --> 15:30.176
Well, it's not a box of wine.

15:30.178 --> 15:36.282
Pam, let me ask you something...
JAKOV: How ken you just leave me here?!

15:36.284 --> 15:39.953
ARCHER: Mainly because I have an
incredibly addictive personality.

15:39.955 --> 15:43.256
So just debrief yourself with the
camera, and when I get back we'll talk

15:43.258 --> 15:47.060
about the DNA test thing, if, ya
know, you're still into doing that.

15:47.062 --> 15:50.263
JAKOV: Of course I em still into thet!

15:50.265 --> 15:53.433
But in meantime, you
think I will be safe?

15:53.435 --> 15:55.402
ARCHER: God, what's Russian for duh?

15:55.404 --> 15:56.469
It's a safehouse!

15:56.471 --> 15:57.871
Nobody knows where it is!

15:57.873 --> 15:59.807
CHERYL/CAROL: Well, here it is!

15:59.809 --> 16:00.608
BARRY: Neat.

16:00.610 --> 16:02.176
Can I see your neck a minute?

16:02.178 --> 16:09.585
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh, Barry...
Barry? Barry!

16:09.587 --> 16:12.955
Barrryyyygrrghhh!

16:12.957 --> 16:15.958
PAM: ... my point is, if you're
confident in yourself as a woman,

16:15.960 --> 16:18.494
who cares if he wants
to keep it on the DL?

16:18.496 --> 16:21.363
MALORY: Well yes, but...
PAM: But nothin!

16:21.365 --> 16:24.500
Because who's to say you're
not using him for sex?

16:24.502 --> 16:26.802
MALORY: Pam, don't take
this the wrong way?

16:26.804 --> 16:29.504
But you're not nearly
as stupid as you look.

16:29.506 --> 16:31.906
PAM: Okay.

16:31.908 --> 16:32.640
ARCHER: Mmmyello?

16:32.642 --> 16:34.542
LANA: Archer don't talk, just listen!

16:34.544 --> 16:35.410
ARCHER: Why, what's up?

16:35.412 --> 16:37.946
What're you -- LANA: Jakov's intel is bad
and Barry's got some sort of master

16:37.948 --> 16:41.684
plan that we're clueless about, thanks to Cyril --
CYRIL: Who has apologized

16:41.686 --> 16:43.486
profusely...
GILLETTE: Quiet game!

16:43.488 --> 16:48.024
LANA: -- so we're gonna regroup at the
safehouse and try to... figure out...

16:48.026 --> 16:48.659
God damn it.

16:48.661 --> 16:49.359
GILLETTE: What.

16:49.361 --> 16:51.095
LANA: Wait for it.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.663
ARCHER: Ha ha haaaa!

16:52.665 --> 16:57.668
Leave it!

16:57.670 --> 16:58.736
JAKOV: <i>Da, da!</i>

16:58.738 --> 17:00.204
<i>Keep your shirt on!</i>

17:00.206 --> 17:03.708
<i>BARRY: Barry doesn't wear a shirt.</i>

17:03.710 --> 17:07.111
<i>Ruins Barry's whole tracksuit vibe.</i>

17:07.113 --> 17:09.413
<i>MALORY: I swear to God, if
he put as much effort into</i>

17:09.415 --> 17:12.782
<i>his job as he does into
those idiot voicemails...</i>

17:12.785 --> 17:15.585
<i>and you say got this
from a KGB sleeper?</i>

17:15.587 --> 17:17.520
<i>LANA: Right before Cyril
blew his head off.</i>

17:17.521 --> 17:18.755
<i>MALORY: What?!</i>

17:18.757 --> 17:25.528
<i>JAKOV: You son of bitch, you
ektually think you will get away with this?!</i>

17:25.530 --> 17:26.628
<i>BARRY: Obviously!</i>

17:26.631 --> 17:28.097
<i>Why else would I do it?</i>

17:28.098 --> 17:30.933
<i>JAKOV: Who knows with
you, you're crezzy!</i>

17:30.935 --> 17:33.769
<i>BARRY: Am I?!</i>

17:33.771 --> 17:36.572
<i>Between Archer ruining my life
and you dicks turning me into</i>

17:36.574 --> 17:39.676
<i>a cyborg, I'm kind of
amazed I'm even this sane.</i>

17:39.678 --> 17:42.278
<i>Which is obviously a
relative term, but --</i>

17:42.280 --> 17:43.380
<i>JAKOV: What are you doing?</i>

17:43.382 --> 17:45.048
<i>BARRY: Rationalizing my behavior.</i>

17:45.050 --> 17:46.049
<i>JAKOV: With gess.</i>

17:46.051 --> 17:47.184
<i>BARRY: Oh.</i>

17:47.186 --> 17:48.418
<i>Killing you.</i>

17:48.420 --> 17:50.254
<i>JAKOV: Oh.</i>

17:50.256 --> 17:54.225
<i>BARRY: Oh, Marmaduke...
JAKOV: End gess is nut so bad</i>

17:54.227 --> 17:57.228
<i>way to die...
BARRY: Well again, relative term.</i>

17:57.230 --> 18:00.031
<i>JAKOV: End efterwerd,
if Sterlink want,</i>

18:00.033 --> 18:02.800
<i>he ken still get some
DNA from my body,</i>

18:02.802 --> 18:05.369
<i>end find out if I em his real father.</i>

18:05.371 --> 18:07.705
<i>BARRY: Which I'm sure would
provide him with some</i>

18:07.707 --> 18:11.342
<i>much-needed closure...
Which is why it's not gonna happen.</i>

18:11.344 --> 18:13.077
<i>JAKOV: Why, what is thet?</i>

18:13.079 --> 18:16.514
<i>BARRY: This - glad you asked -
is a block of ice with a fork</i>

18:16.516 --> 18:17.114
<i>frozen in it.</i>

18:17.116 --> 18:18.750
<i>JAKOV: What are you doing with it?</i>

18:18.752 --> 18:22.587
<i>BARRY: I am putting this
fork-filled block of ice in this</i>

18:22.589 --> 18:27.124
<i>microwave oven... Now I'm setting
the timer for five -- Oh heck,</i>

18:27.126 --> 18:29.059
<i>let's call it ten minutes.</i>

18:29.061 --> 18:30.961
<i>Doesn't matter, ice can't tell time.</i>

18:30.963 --> 18:34.565
<i>JAKOV: It ken unly melt...
BARRY: And when it does...</i>

18:34.567 --> 18:39.103
<i>JAKOV: Spark from fork, gas from stuv...
