39:14.090 --> 39:15.657
-STEPHANIE, GET REAL.

39:15.788 --> 39:17.572
THERE'S NO WAY THORPE'S
GONNA APPROVE THIS TRANSFER.

39:17.703 --> 39:18.791
-WHY NOT?

39:18.921 --> 39:20.183
-WHY NOT? WHERE
ARE WE GONNA GET

39:20.314 --> 39:22.577
THE FUNDING FOR
ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL?

39:22.708 --> 39:25.145
DIDN'T YOU GET HIS LAST
MEMO ON BUDGET CUTBACKS?

39:25.275 --> 39:26.973
-WELL, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
CHIEF THORPE OWED YOU A FAVOR.

39:27.103 --> 39:28.540
-HE DOES.

39:28.670 --> 39:29.889
AND I'M SAVING IT FOR
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

39:30.019 --> 39:30.890
-OH, MITCH.

39:31.020 --> 39:32.413
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

39:32.544 --> 39:33.936
-COME ON, YOU'RE TELLING
ME YOU REALLY WANT

39:34.067 --> 39:36.504
CARLOS TO WORK HERE
ON A PERMANENT BASIS?

39:36.635 --> 39:38.506
REALLY? I MEAN,
WON'T IT BE TOO MUCH

39:38.637 --> 39:40.203
OF A DISTRACTION FOR YOU?

39:40.334 --> 39:41.901
I MEAN, ARE YOU SURE YOU'LL
BE ABLE TO CONCENTRATE?

39:42.031 --> 39:43.206
-VERY FUNNY.

39:43.337 --> 39:44.599
[LAUGHTER]

39:45.992 --> 39:47.341
-HI, GUYS.
-MITCH: HEY.

39:47.472 --> 39:49.430
-HI.
-CARLOS: HI.

39:49.561 --> 39:51.301
-WHAT HAPPENED? I THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST A SPRAIN.

39:51.432 --> 39:52.390
-YEAH, ME TOO.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.174
BUT THE SWELLING NEVER WENT DOWN

39:54.304 --> 39:55.480
SO I HAD AN MRI.

39:56.306 --> 39:58.526
TURNS OUT I TORE THE
ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT.

39:59.266 --> 40:00.310
LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA
BE OUT OF ACTION

40:00.441 --> 40:01.747
FOR NINE MONTHS TO A YEAR.

40:01.877 --> 40:03.531
-YOU'RE KIDDING?

40:03.662 --> 40:05.577
-I GO IN FOR SURGERY TOMORROW.

40:06.186 --> 40:08.362
I JUST CAME BY TO
CLEAN OUT MY LOCKER.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.673
-OH WELL.

40:15.369 --> 40:17.023
EASY COME, EASY GO.

40:18.285 --> 40:20.156
-HE'S NOT DEAD.

40:22.158 --> 40:23.595
-HE'S NOT DEAD.

40:26.075 --> 40:28.513
-SOLID RINGS. OOH.

40:29.818 --> 40:31.124
-AND BLOW ON IT.

40:31.777 --> 40:33.996

40:36.738 --> 40:38.348
WITH THE CHAINS IN THE WATER?

40:38.479 --> 40:39.872
-OH, I'M SORRY, HOBIE,
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY

40:40.002 --> 40:41.656
TELL YOU HOW I DID MY
DEATH-DEFYING FEAT.

40:41.787 --> 40:43.049
-I'LL TELL YOU HOW HE DID IT.

40:43.179 --> 40:44.529
-HOW?

40:44.659 --> 40:45.660
-MAGIC.

40:45.791 --> 40:46.835
-OH, COME ON, REALLY. TELL ME.

40:46.966 --> 40:48.663
-MAGIC!

40:48.794 --> 40:50.448
WITH A LITTLE HELP
FROM A MERMAID.

40:51.449 --> 40:52.624
-A MERMAID, SURE.

40:52.754 --> 40:54.669
I'M OUT OF HERE,
YOU GUYS ARE NUTS!

40:54.800 --> 40:57.150
-HEY, THANKS FOR NOT
KILLING THE ILLUSION.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.891
-WELL, LIKE I SAID BEFORE,

40:59.021 --> 41:00.022
MY LIPS ARE SEALED.

41:00.806 --> 41:02.068
-WELL, WOULD YOU
MIND UNSEALING THEM

41:02.198 --> 41:03.939
FOR A MOMENT SO I CAN
GIVE YOU A GOODBYE KISS?

41:04.070 --> 41:05.158
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

41:06.551 --> 41:08.422
-I DON'T MIND AT ALL.
