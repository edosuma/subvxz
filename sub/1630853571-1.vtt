WEBVTT

00:07.425 --> 00:09.468
- It's not fair.

00:09.552 --> 00:11.637
You're flying business class
and I'm stuck here?

00:11.721 --> 00:13.597
<i>Your parents</i>
<i>are making you spend summer</i>

00:13.681 --> 00:15.683
<i>- on a lake-- We're monsters.</i>
- But I'm losing

00:15.766 --> 00:17.685
two months of swim training
and senior prep

00:17.768 --> 00:20.271
and missing the junior
climate conference I organized.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.440
<i>Okay, everyone</i>
<i>needs an off-season, hon.</i>

00:22.523 --> 00:24.275
But I said I'm sorry.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.152
- Why can't I just come home?
- <i>You know why.</i>

00:26.235 --> 00:28.070
<i>Now, daddy and I both</i>
<i>feel it's safer with you</i>

00:28.154 --> 00:29.989
<i>in the country while</i>
<i>we're on tour with the book.</i>

00:30.072 --> 00:32.032
You think it's safer here?

00:32.116 --> 00:34.076
I'm about to get eaten
by inbred hillbillies or

00:34.160 --> 00:36.370
- rumble with drunken townies.
<i>- And it's important to know</i>

00:36.454 --> 00:38.205
<i>your birth father now that</i>
<i>he's back in the country.</i>

00:38.289 --> 00:39.790
I have a dad

00:39.874 --> 00:41.500
who's usually
pretty cool when he's

00:41.584 --> 00:43.627
not sending me back
to the factory for parts.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.880
<i>We're giving you a chance to</i>
<i>connect with your birth story.</i>

00:45.963 --> 00:47.965
<i>You know how daddy and</i>
<i>I feel about open adoption.</i>

00:48.048 --> 00:49.759
- Just once.

00:49.842 --> 00:51.802
Angry nuns hiding a slutty
teen mom might be nice.

00:51.886 --> 00:54.013
<i>Well, you know,</i>
<i>Justin does skew a bit slutty</i>

00:54.096 --> 00:56.557
<i>but good luck trying to find</i>
<i>his skeleton in a closet.</i>

00:56.640 --> 00:57.933
"Rainbow pops."

00:58.017 --> 01:00.060
That's just a bit on the nose.

01:00.144 --> 01:01.771
Chocolate.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.606
Uh, pandering.

01:03.689 --> 01:06.567
Vanilla...
is probably triggering.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.402
Oreo.

01:08.486 --> 01:10.946
Definitely insulting.

01:11.030 --> 01:13.449
And Neapolitan is
every flavor of colonialism.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.578
- Do you need a hand?
- Wah...

01:17.661 --> 01:19.205
- Back there?
- Um...

01:19.288 --> 01:21.916
Uh, um...

01:22.958 --> 01:26.545
Uh no, I'm great,
I'm good. I got my--

01:26.629 --> 01:28.088
I got my stuff.

01:28.172 --> 01:29.757
I just have to get
a couple of things.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.968
Some <i>cafecito,</i>

01:33.052 --> 01:34.887
cheddar, little bit of smep--

01:34.970 --> 01:36.806
Don't know what that is.

01:36.889 --> 01:39.141
And who doesn't want
a fruity hole?

01:39.725 --> 01:42.561
Weirdo sausage cooker.

01:42.645 --> 01:45.898
Bugs,
don't want any of that stuff.

01:45.981 --> 01:48.400
- I got it.

01:48.484 --> 01:49.819
Sorry.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.571
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:52.655 --> 01:54.323
Hi.

01:54.406 --> 01:55.449
Hi.

01:56.659 --> 01:58.077
No ice cream?

01:58.160 --> 01:59.912
You lose
the argument back there?

01:59.995 --> 02:03.207
Oh yes.
Uh, very lactose intolerant.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.627
Who needs to douche after
a shot of two percent, right?

02:08.629 --> 02:10.047
TMI...

02:10.130 --> 02:12.424
- Yi-yi.

02:12.508 --> 02:15.219
No, my daughter is an athlete,

02:15.302 --> 02:18.472
so you know, it is just
a bit of, like, a fit shamer.

02:19.223 --> 02:20.391
Wow. My daughter.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.142
That is so weird
to say out loud.

02:22.226 --> 02:23.644
Only if it's not your daughter.

02:23.727 --> 02:25.771
No, I--
I had her in high school

02:25.855 --> 02:27.356
and then I took off
to Australia.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.066
That's why I'm so young...

02:30.401 --> 02:32.528
But there was an adoption
in between that time.

02:32.611 --> 02:34.405
So like, she's got parents
and they love her

02:34.488 --> 02:36.240
and she feels really good
about it and I feel

02:36.323 --> 02:38.117
really good about it.
I mean, it was tough

02:38.200 --> 02:40.119
for a little while, like,
you know, good five years where

02:40.202 --> 02:42.705
I was just like a total mess.
But no, it's great now.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.665
I'm just looking after her
while they're away and

02:44.748 --> 02:46.250
it's our first
vacation together.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.752
I got us a sweet
little place up on the lake.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.462
Lucky to find a spot.

02:50.546 --> 02:51.881
It's mostly lifers up here.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.465
Yeah, I know. I know.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.968
My grandparents used
to own a cottage up here

02:56.051 --> 02:57.887
then my dad sold it because
my stepmom wanted

02:57.970 --> 02:59.722
some shitty condo
in Florida or something.

02:59.805 --> 03:01.891
Ouch. Oh,

03:01.974 --> 03:05.185
but without their shining
example of marital dystopia,

03:05.269 --> 03:07.062
I'd have missed out
on years of formative trauma

03:07.146 --> 03:09.231
dating any bearded
man-child with tat--

03:12.401 --> 03:13.444
...Toos.

03:19.408 --> 03:20.659
Have a great summer.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.456
They look great on you.

03:28.292 --> 03:29.877
I thought we were
stopping for ice cream.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.715
That better be your shit.

03:34.798 --> 03:35.883
Yeah.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.639
What happened?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.265
I think I just tried to seduce

03:43.349 --> 03:45.392
my prison hipster fantasy
with anal douching.

03:45.476 --> 03:47.353
That's what my generation
doesn't have sex.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.854
- Ugh.
- Oh...

03:50.064 --> 03:51.565
- Whoa!
- What?

03:51.649 --> 03:53.192
Still plugged in.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.110
Well, how much longer
till a full charge?

03:55.194 --> 03:57.488
- 30 minutes.
- 30 minutes?

03:57.571 --> 03:59.239
Saving the environment
takes time.

03:59.323 --> 04:01.408
- Oh, God!

04:18.092 --> 04:19.969
I know I probably should
have gotten one of those

04:20.052 --> 04:21.929
four by four things, but...

04:22.012 --> 04:24.556
it just seems so homophobic.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.351
Hey, you've seen pictures
of the cottage I rented, right?

04:27.434 --> 04:29.395
So cute.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.313
Fingers crossed there's AC.

04:31.397 --> 04:32.982
Air conditioning
is one of the biggest

04:33.065 --> 04:34.942
contributors to climate change.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.902
Right. Who needs AC on a lake?

04:45.160 --> 04:47.621
- See?

04:47.705 --> 04:50.833
Total lakeside fantasy.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.886
And '80s horror realness.

05:03.804 --> 05:07.141
I'll have to stay a virgin if
I want to make it to Labor Day.

05:07.224 --> 05:10.102
Now feels like the right time
to start drinking.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.646
Maintaining
a lowkey buzz is critical

05:12.730 --> 05:14.481
to every college experience.

05:14.565 --> 05:17.317
So is Mama a Rose or a...

05:17.401 --> 05:18.569
Sauv Blanc?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.612
Mama is 16.

05:21.613 --> 05:22.990
Right.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.284
So maybe just
a swim in the lake.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.787
Everything feels better
after a swim in the lake.

05:33.584 --> 05:34.877
I got it.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.628
- Ew.
- What?

05:36.712 --> 05:39.006
Don't tell me you've never
swum in a lake before?

05:39.089 --> 05:40.340
You're supposed to
be training for, like,

05:40.424 --> 05:41.759
the baby Olympics or something.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.469
There better not be
any leeches.

05:43.552 --> 05:46.346
Actually,
leeches are excellent

05:46.430 --> 05:47.973
for curing hypertension,

05:48.057 --> 05:51.018
also for reattaching fingers
after surgery.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.561
Just like
the cure for hemorrhoids

05:52.644 --> 05:53.979
the Romans had hoped.

05:55.147 --> 05:57.316
Hello, my name is Irika.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.942
I have the cottage next door.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.070
Hola. Hi, I'm Justin.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.030
- This is my daughter, Billie.
- Uh, birth daughter.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.448
- I'm adopted.
- Yes,

06:04.531 --> 06:06.241
but it was an open adoption so

06:06.325 --> 06:08.077
the birth parents are still
part of their kid's life.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.578
He got his best friend
pregnant at prom

06:09.661 --> 06:11.121
like in a dumb teen comedy.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.664
But not funny
because we thought we'd

06:12.748 --> 06:14.166
ruined our lives
and our families hated us.

06:14.249 --> 06:17.878
Oh. Well,
wolves raise pups communally.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.630
The male emu looks
after the young

06:19.713 --> 06:21.465
while the female goes
in search of a new mate.

06:21.548 --> 06:25.928
Yes. Yeah. Polyemu-ry
is a valid life choice.

06:26.011 --> 06:28.889
I have a little
hour around five.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.224
Please come by any time.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.809
- Okay. Thanks.
- Great.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.852
Dido.

06:33.936 --> 06:37.272
Tra-la-la.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.525
Please tell me that's seaweed.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.361
Unwaxed seaweed,
but the hat's a fresh spin.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.779
You still wanna swim in that?

06:43.862 --> 06:45.864
- No, I think we'll canoe--
- Awesome.

06:45.948 --> 06:49.451
And let this lake
air out a little bit.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.546
Oh, no, no, no.
You make a J.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.548
You make a J with your paddle,
make a J--

07:02.631 --> 07:04.049
Uppercase
or lowercase?

07:04.133 --> 07:05.759
Well no,
just like a letter J.

07:05.843 --> 07:07.803
- Just like J for like Justin.
- Okay!

07:07.886 --> 07:11.181
Yeah, okay or like, Lustin.
That also works.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.477
Hey,
you see that cottage?

07:15.561 --> 07:16.812
Yeah.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.230
That's the Henderson's.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.815
After 30 years
of subpar banging,

07:19.898 --> 07:21.608
Mrs. Henderson
leased her husband out

07:21.692 --> 07:23.735
to her best friend,
Maureen, two nights a week.

07:23.819 --> 07:27.656
But <i>escandalo,</i> Mr. Henderson
broke the agreement

07:27.739 --> 07:31.076
and married Maureen
at Tilt-a-Palooza next summer.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.953
- Tilt-a-Palooza?
- Yeah,

07:33.036 --> 07:34.454
it's the last event
on the lake before

07:34.538 --> 07:36.123
the boathouse shuts
for the season.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.625
There's a regatta.
It's a potluck throw down.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.460
There's the Tilt Off.
Everybody competes

07:40.544 --> 07:42.212
for shitty prizes
and bragging rights

07:42.296 --> 07:44.131
and people hold grudges
for generations.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.674
Sounds about white.

07:47.426 --> 07:48.594
- And that one

07:48.677 --> 07:49.803
used to be ours.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.555
My great grandfather built it.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.515
It was my happy place
till my dad remarried

07:53.599 --> 07:56.059
and my wicked stepsister
ruined everything.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.396
I spent every summer
there as a kid.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.273
Who owns it now.

08:01.356 --> 08:02.482
I don't know.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.695
Do you want to find out?

08:06.778 --> 08:08.155
Shouldn't we call first?

08:08.238 --> 08:10.240
No, I'm just a neighbour.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.783
I'm dropping in
on another neighbour.

08:11.867 --> 08:14.203
Feels more like trespassing.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.829
Justin, I don't like this.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.831
Well, you should probably
turn us around then.

08:19.625 --> 08:23.503
Uh-oh, someone needs
to work on their J-stroke.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.638
Ugh. Do you believe how...

08:32.721 --> 08:34.598
Gorgeous it is?

08:34.681 --> 08:36.850
It's like heaven took a nap.

08:36.934 --> 08:38.727
And that dock.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.604
I want a baby with that dock.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.856
- Hello!

08:45.525 --> 08:47.945
- Okay. We came, we knocked.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.988
- We leave.
- No, Come on!

08:50.072 --> 08:51.740
I want to see how
these power douches

08:51.823 --> 08:54.493
ruined the homestead
with their exquisite taste.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.414
You know, you climb up that,

08:59.498 --> 09:00.916
you can get in
through the window.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.501
It's how I snuck home
after curfew--

09:02.584 --> 09:04.711
Except you're not 12
and that's a felony.

09:04.795 --> 09:06.255
No! It's an adventure.

09:06.338 --> 09:08.048
It's like a classic,
summer shenanigan.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.050
See, for a Black girl,
breaking and entering

09:10.133 --> 09:11.677
is more a,
"When they see us" adventure

09:11.760 --> 09:13.762
than a Wet, Hot American
Summer shenanigan.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.347
Fair point. Okay.
Just keep an eye out

09:15.430 --> 09:17.432
to see if anybody
comes back, okay?

09:19.268 --> 09:20.560
I'm doing it!

09:20.644 --> 09:22.562
Birth dad is doing it.

09:22.646 --> 09:25.065
Mom will definitely let me
come home if she sees this.

09:26.441 --> 09:27.484
- Damn.
- Yep.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.986
I'm still flexible.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.294
Holy shit.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.463
Oh, it's all the same.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.152
Shit. Shit, shit.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.546
No way.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.510
My God, Grandpa.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.179
- Justin.
- Shit!

10:37.262 --> 10:39.222
- Let's go! Someone's coming.
- Okay.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.932
- What are you doing?
- What? It was my grandpa's--

10:41.016 --> 10:42.684
Put it back
or I'm calling the Coast Guard.

10:42.768 --> 10:44.478
There's no
Coast Guard on a lake.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.104
It's a committee
and you get elected.

10:46.188 --> 10:47.939
Oh, my God.
Would you shut up and go.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.529
Oh!

11:36.863 --> 11:38.698
- Uh, who are you?
- Uh, sorry.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.534
We're Billie.
I'm Billie. He's Justin.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.453
Yeah, I'm her dad.
I'm her birth dad.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.414
I'm adopted.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.082
Gave me up because he's gay.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.750
No, I just
chose parents who could

11:48.834 --> 11:50.877
give her a better life.
Wasn't even out yet.

11:50.961 --> 11:52.796
- Well.
- But I am now.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.716
Yes, queen.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.386
Nice to meet you. I'm Victor.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.971
- This is my son, Killian.
- Hi.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.931
What are
you doing on our dock?

12:03.014 --> 12:04.933
Oh, my great grand
something built your cottage.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.768
- He wanted to show me.
- Yeah, I did.

12:06.852 --> 12:08.770
I-I knocked. We did knock,
but nobody was home.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.730
Maybe you could give us a tour.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.691
- Yeah.
- I'll ask my wife.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.526
- It's her cottage.
- Yeah.

12:14.609 --> 12:15.861
Everyone's getting
ready for the boathouse

12:15.944 --> 12:17.195
barbecue tonight.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.364
- Oh...
- You comin'?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.576
Yeah. We wouldn't miss it.

12:24.286 --> 12:26.496
We got so much unpacking to do.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.791
Just loads of it but
it was really nice to meet you.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.835
- We'll, um...

12:31.918 --> 12:33.378
It was really good to mee--

12:33.462 --> 12:35.046
We'll just get out
of your hair.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.798
- Yeah.
- You guys need help at all?

12:36.882 --> 12:38.925
No, no, no, no, no,
no. No. We're fine.

12:39.009 --> 12:41.219
- Have fun.
- Okay, well,

12:41.303 --> 12:42.554
it was great to meet you.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.389
Really great meeting you. Bye.

12:44.473 --> 12:46.308
Bye.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.852
Why do you need to
ask mom to show the cottage?

12:48.935 --> 12:52.272
Son, you know your mom
likes everything to be perfect.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.441
For the record,
that's how you get

12:54.524 --> 12:56.151
a tour without
invading someone's home.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.570
A tour of what? Your vagina?

12:58.653 --> 13:01.323
I saw you drooling over
that Aber-zombie.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.868
Yeah. And you were eye-boning
his dad, so whatever.

13:04.951 --> 13:08.038
Yeah, well I don't need to stay
a virgin to survive the summer.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.083
Get ready for some deep dives

13:12.167 --> 13:14.127
into septic tanks
tonight at the barbecue.

13:14.211 --> 13:17.005
How you flush your poop is
a hot button topic on the lake.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.381
There's no signal here.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.842
Yes. Someone is
coming on Monday.

13:20.926 --> 13:23.845
You can ask Irika
to use hers but...

13:23.929 --> 13:26.640
I don't know if textiles
and bandwidth are compatible.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.558
Do you know
how parenting works?

13:28.642 --> 13:30.727
'Cause, baseline,
you keep the kid safe.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.979
Like, don't rent a cottage
in the middle of the woods

13:33.063 --> 13:35.440
if you can't call for help when
invaded by rednecks or demons.

13:35.524 --> 13:37.192
Or don't be the redneck

13:37.275 --> 13:39.110
invading someone
else's cottage.

13:39.194 --> 13:41.071
I just wanted to show you
where you came from.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.490
- That's all.
- I know where I came from.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.534
Three hundred clicks from here.
And I'm going back

13:45.617 --> 13:47.744
as soon as I tell Mom and Dad
that you broke into--

13:47.827 --> 13:50.372
No. Let's just--
Woop, put the pause on.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.541
I-I I just got--

13:52.624 --> 13:55.043
I got a little excited
moving from FaceTime

13:55.126 --> 13:57.671
to real time, that's all.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.297
I just haven't been
on the same continent

13:59.381 --> 14:00.715
as you since you were a baby.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.342
Whose fault is that?

14:05.011 --> 14:06.930
Look, I don't know
what you did to deserve it

14:07.013 --> 14:09.140
but your parents said that
it was either summer with me

14:09.224 --> 14:10.976
or it was
Pioneer Girls Bible camp.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.811
Now, if you would
prefer experimenting

14:12.894 --> 14:15.564
with light lesbianism
and the word of our Lord,

14:15.647 --> 14:18.441
then by all means,
call them from the boat house.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.905
Look, Billie,
I know that this is not

14:23.989 --> 14:25.782
- the summer that you wanted--
Oh? You mean

14:25.865 --> 14:27.826
moderating the virtual climate
conference I organized?

14:28.952 --> 14:30.787
- What is the point

14:30.870 --> 14:32.247
of trying
to save the environment

14:32.330 --> 14:33.873
if you're not gonna
enjoy any of it?

14:37.586 --> 14:41.339
I bet that you could ask, uh,
Kissy, kissy Kissian

14:41.423 --> 14:43.383
to show you around
the barbecue tonight.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.510
I am the child. Me.

14:45.594 --> 14:46.886
Just give it a shot.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.054
At least for tonight.

14:49.264 --> 14:50.682
Just...

14:50.765 --> 14:52.058
Don't try to be my parent.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.060
Never. No.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.688
I'm not like other birth dads.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.690
I'm a cool birth dad.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.984
Are you quoting Mean girls?

15:01.067 --> 15:02.652
Your parents have their Bible.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.362
I have mine.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.202
Pretty extra
for a boat house.

15:11.286 --> 15:14.080
Well,
it's over 150 years old.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.707
Used to be a fishing club.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.876
Menfolk only
and then ladies became people.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.961
So, hard pivot.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.671
Uh, it's kind of
like if the PTA ran

15:21.755 --> 15:23.632
a daycare for
functional alcoholics.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.484
Why is everyone staring at us?

15:42.567 --> 15:45.737
Because my gay ass
giving you up for adoption

15:45.820 --> 15:48.657
was the second biggest
<i>escandala</i> to rock the lake

15:48.740 --> 15:51.326
since Whore-reen shacked up
with Saggy Balls Henderson.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.619
Whore-reen is the lady

15:52.702 --> 15:54.162
we're renting the cabin from.

15:54.245 --> 15:57.540
Woah... So much sunburn.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.126
Yeah, the beginning of
the season's always <i>muy charro.</i>

16:00.210 --> 16:02.420
We're weeks
from peak sunscreen.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.255
Too late to make a run for it?

16:04.339 --> 16:05.924
For me, yes. The sharks
are already circling.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.592
But the lifeguard lounge
down the hall is empty.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.804
- Go run for your life.
- Justin Lovejoy!

16:10.887 --> 16:12.347
Can't believe you're back, bud.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.766
Hey, Wayne. Jane.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.810
- Was that...?
- Child I abandoned? Yes.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.728
- Hilarious.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.438
That sense of humor hasn't
vanished with your waistline.

16:20.522 --> 16:23.108
O-M-Jeepers.
You are so mini now!

16:23.191 --> 16:25.485
Australia.
The misogyny and the melanoma

16:25.568 --> 16:27.070
just melt the fat away.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.822
Is it true?
Did you date a Hemsworth?

16:28.905 --> 16:30.281
- Yeah.
- A Coffs Harbour Hemsworth.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.200
Yeah.
Shorter, more knuckle hair.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.786
Oh, and now you're back
to be a parent

16:34.869 --> 16:37.080
after giving it up
for the wild gay lifestyle.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.374
Well, this place has
seen more threesomes

16:39.457 --> 16:40.959
and fists in the tush than me.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.965
Hey, listen, you need any help,
you come see us, alright?

16:47.048 --> 16:48.842
- We got four now.
- Oh fuck.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.136
Terrier, Jerika,
Kerrigan and Olive.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.512
Low motility.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.013
Yeah, they stuck
a bunch of eggs up

16:54.097 --> 16:55.724
because my guys
don't swim so good.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.392
Well, I guess they had
a fucking grappling hook.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.936
They blew out Janie's vulva.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.398
It's so great to have you home.

17:04.441 --> 17:05.692
Just like old times.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.360
Oh fuck, I hope not.

17:13.992 --> 17:16.786
- Hiding?
- Oh, it was a bit

17:16.870 --> 17:19.330
Housewives of Cottage Country
up there.

17:19.414 --> 17:21.291
What's this
chapter in Sunstroke?

17:21.374 --> 17:24.252
Tilting.
Its canoe jousting.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.045
Yeah, that definitely
wouldn't happen

17:26.129 --> 17:27.505
with more melanin on the lake.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.674
It's actually
pretty fun, though.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.384
There's
a tournament every summer.

17:31.468 --> 17:32.802
My dad's won it nine times.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.554
One more, he get a free canoe?

17:34.637 --> 17:36.306
Better. He beats
Wayne Moore's record.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.057
That dude's a talking shark.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.852
So a bunch of guys
affirming patriarchal rituals

17:40.935 --> 17:42.520
of dominance and aggression.

17:42.604 --> 17:43.938
Maybe I should try.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.315
Subvert the system.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.984
You would be going up
against the junior champ.

17:49.194 --> 17:50.612
And I hear he's unbeatable.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.239
Sounds like a dare.

17:54.199 --> 17:57.368
So, must be weird not
having the old place, huh?

17:57.452 --> 17:59.078
Never thought you'd let it go.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.747
Yeah, well, it wasn't
really up to me, Wayne.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.749
Do you know who owns it now?

18:02.832 --> 18:06.044
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
I dropped by earlier today.

18:06.127 --> 18:07.504
- Mm.
- Wow.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.339
- Mm.
- And you were cool with that?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.591
Yes. Yeah. Guys,
you can't live in the past.

18:11.674 --> 18:14.677
You know,
you gotta move on. And, um...

18:14.761 --> 18:16.888
you know what? I'm actually
gonna go say hi right now,

18:16.971 --> 18:18.765
but it was great
chatting with you both.

18:18.848 --> 18:23.269
And you--
you have not changed at all.

18:23.353 --> 18:25.021
- Exactly the same.
- What does that mean?

18:25.104 --> 18:26.356
I don't know.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.650
- Hey, Victor. Hi!
- Justin.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.276
Yeah.
Do you know Riley?

18:30.360 --> 18:31.903
Yes, from earlier.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.571
From the gas
and goin' down, not on you.

18:33.655 --> 18:35.240
I mean, like in flames.

18:35.323 --> 18:36.908
Because when we met,
I was such a re--

18:36.991 --> 18:38.952
No. We don't say
that word anymore.

18:39.035 --> 18:40.411
That's a bad word.

18:40.495 --> 18:41.746
So good to meet you again

18:41.830 --> 18:43.957
for a second time
to do this again.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.458
And this is my son, Darian.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.711
- Opal.
- I'm so sorry.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.964
Last time.
Opal is his chosen name.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.882
- My pronouns are he and him.
- Hey, me too.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.300
Pronoun twinsies.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.803
We're having
a bit of a rough night.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.596
Opal's pick got torpedoed
for movie night.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.973
But I got there first.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.808
That's why
there's a sign up sheet.

19:01.891 --> 19:04.394
Now, we have
to watch the Minions. Again.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.770
I thought Minions were cool.

19:05.854 --> 19:07.522
More like cretins.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.232
You can watch "Carol,"
later with your Zoom crew.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.442
Fine, but Killian can't
watch porn when we do.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.152
The buffering's maddening.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.322
Carol.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.116
- Tough sell.
- He's still a bit upset

19:18.199 --> 19:20.785
over getting booted off
the talent show committee.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.996
He wanted to replace
the annual show with

19:23.079 --> 19:25.415
Canadian Diva Edition.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.876
- Oh.
- You start in with Anne Murray.

19:27.959 --> 19:30.420
Work your way
through Jann Arden, K.D. Lang,

19:30.503 --> 19:31.921
Sarah McLachlan.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.756
Anyone can do Celine or Shania.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.550
Yeah, that's so true.

19:35.633 --> 19:36.968
I really want
to meet your wife.

19:37.051 --> 19:38.720
Dying to, in fact.
Is she around?

19:38.803 --> 19:40.805
Yeah, yeah,

19:40.889 --> 19:42.348
there's something
you should know about my--

19:42.432 --> 19:43.474
Justin?

19:46.895 --> 19:49.272
Justin Lovejoy?

19:49.355 --> 19:51.482
- Maisie-May?
- Your stepsister.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.944
Welcome home, little brother.

20:03.286 --> 20:04.871
Wow.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.749
Remember,
brace before you swing.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.626
Oh, I'll brace. Your face.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.085
- That's weak.

20:11.169 --> 20:13.129
Still gonna destroy you.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.547
Here's the thing
about pride and fal--

20:21.346 --> 20:23.139
Told you to brace--

20:26.351 --> 20:28.019
Works both ways.

20:28.102 --> 20:30.396
Oh, my God.
Killian, stop pawing her.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.023
She's not a chew toy.

20:34.359 --> 20:37.028
Uh-- uh, Billie, this is...

20:37.111 --> 20:40.657
uh, Kerri,
Terri, Jerri. And Olive.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.075
- Hi.
- They have the cottage

20:42.158 --> 20:43.576
across from the boathouse.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.078
Look at what we nicked
from the canteen.

20:45.703 --> 20:49.207
This Tiltin's
'bout to get turnt.

21:00.301 --> 21:04.639
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!

21:09.477 --> 21:11.437
- You ready, Jerri?
- It's Terri.

21:11.521 --> 21:12.772
Whatever, Taylor.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.357
- Nice.
- Go Terri,

21:14.440 --> 21:17.235
- go Terri, go Terri...
- Let's go, Airy.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.115
Boom.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.702
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!

21:25.785 --> 21:27.578
- Shot! Shot! Shot!

21:27.662 --> 21:29.998
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!

21:30.081 --> 21:32.500
- Maybe that's enough?
- Back off, Kissy.

21:34.335 --> 21:35.545
I don't understand.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.171
My dad was gonna
sell the cottage

21:37.255 --> 21:40.133
so that your mom could buy,
some, like...

21:40.216 --> 21:42.093
condo in Florida.

21:42.176 --> 21:44.429
He changed his mind.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.264
So what?
Did you like, buy it from him?

21:46.347 --> 21:47.724
No, he left it to me.

21:49.684 --> 21:52.020
I think he saw how
much it meant to me.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.521
And how much
it meant to the boys.

21:53.604 --> 21:55.189
He wanted to
keep it in the family.

21:55.273 --> 21:57.608
Yeah, it's weird because
we're not even related.

21:57.692 --> 22:00.945
Your mom is like
barely married to my dad.

22:01.029 --> 22:03.239
16 years. Yeah,
but the first two don't count.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.033
He was still married to my mom.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.245
Listen, I know
that you and your--

22:10.079 --> 22:12.165
Dad didn't have
an easy relationship.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.459
I mean, I'm not making
excuses for his behaviour.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.627
After you gave Billie up,

22:16.711 --> 22:18.296
he really did change.

22:18.379 --> 22:20.256
You should
have seen him with Opal.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.301
And---

22:23.384 --> 22:25.428
And I understand why you left.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.805
I couldn't imagine
giving my babies up.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.893
I know how much
the lake meant to you

22:31.976 --> 22:33.519
when you were growing up.
I mean,

22:33.603 --> 22:35.104
that's why you brought
Billie here, right--

22:35.188 --> 22:36.731
- Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!
- Oh, my God, Billie.

22:36.814 --> 22:38.816
Oh, you know we don't litter.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.026
Shot! Shot!

22:40.109 --> 22:41.861
- Drink up!

22:41.944 --> 22:43.613
Hey, hey, what's going on here?

22:43.696 --> 22:45.073
Oh, hi.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.033
I'm tilting the shit out
of these three...

22:48.576 --> 22:50.203
- Six bitches.
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.871
Easy, Spinnie-Minnie.

22:52.330 --> 22:54.207
- Mm.
- She had it when we got here.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.584
- What's goin' on?

22:56.667 --> 22:58.294
It's fine, Maisie,
I can handle it, alright?

22:58.377 --> 23:00.296
Well, let me help you.
I know these kids.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.298
I would know them too if
you didn't steal the cottage.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.092
- Oh, my God--
- They stole our cottage?

23:04.175 --> 23:05.760
- What's going on, girls?
- Uh, I don't know.

23:05.843 --> 23:07.470
We were just teaching her
how to tilt, Mom.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.430
Yeah, she was like
this when we got here.

23:09.514 --> 23:12.308
The rules are very clear about

23:12.391 --> 23:14.727
A two week suspension
from boathouse privileges

23:14.811 --> 23:18.940
and the parents pay a $200 fee
to the Canteen Renovation Fund.

23:19.023 --> 23:21.651
Both biological and adopted.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.112
Mm-mm. I don't want to
go to Bible camp.

23:24.195 --> 23:25.655
Shit, your breath.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.825
The only one
drinking here is me.

23:36.624 --> 23:39.085
- Oh, my God.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.588
Oh. You know what?

23:42.672 --> 23:44.090
Why shouldn't I be drinking?

23:45.049 --> 23:48.302
My birthright
was stolen from me

23:48.386 --> 23:50.596
by trickery and deception.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.557
- There was no--
- De-cep-tion.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.855
Oh, fuck. I forgot all
about the wine I, uh...

23:58.938 --> 24:00.898
Wine before liquor.

24:00.982 --> 24:02.733
- Never sicker.
- That's right, girls.

24:02.817 --> 24:05.319
To reclaim my family honour,

24:05.403 --> 24:07.655
I challenge you,

24:07.738 --> 24:10.116
Maisie-May,

24:10.199 --> 24:14.620
by the sacred blood oath
of trial by tilt.

24:14.704 --> 24:16.164
That's not a thing.

24:16.247 --> 24:17.665
Come on.
Let's see where this goes.

24:17.748 --> 24:18.875
This could be good. Come on.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.751
If defeated in lawful tilt,

24:20.835 --> 24:24.338
you have to return the cottage
to its rightful owners.

24:25.882 --> 24:28.092
Will you answer the call?

24:28.176 --> 24:29.385
No-- We will.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.845
- What?
- Trust me.

24:30.928 --> 24:33.306
The challenge was
actually for Maisie.

24:33.389 --> 24:35.892
Well as her husband
and champion,

24:35.975 --> 24:37.518
I'm sworn to defend her honour.

24:37.602 --> 24:39.145
A moment, Sir Lancelot.

24:39.228 --> 24:41.272
Mm-mn. You can't win.

24:41.355 --> 24:43.649
Victor's been
tilting champ nine--

24:43.733 --> 24:45.443
I lost every tilt
and my father's love

24:45.526 --> 24:48.196
by the third grade,
but if I do this,

24:48.279 --> 24:50.406
no one is going
to remember your drinking.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.701
Are you insane? You can't give
away our cottage if you lose.

24:53.784 --> 24:55.828
Just play along.
Babe, he just found out

24:55.912 --> 24:57.663
that his dad gave it to you.
I'll let him

24:57.747 --> 24:59.749
knock me around a little,
make him feel better.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.334
Trust me.

25:01.417 --> 25:02.585
We're ready!

25:02.668 --> 25:04.003
You're gonna humiliate yourself

25:04.086 --> 25:05.671
in front of all these people?

25:05.755 --> 25:06.964
For you?

25:07.882 --> 25:09.383
Anything.

25:09.467 --> 25:11.052
Aww.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.471
But I'm gonna need you
to walk me to the dock

25:13.554 --> 25:15.556
because a lot
is starting to spin.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.433
It's happening, it's happening.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.101
We got a tilt.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.064
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:23.147 --> 25:24.815
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:24.899 --> 25:27.151
Perhaps we should go inside
and have some bread.

25:46.254 --> 25:47.922
We didn't steal
your dad's cottage.

25:48.005 --> 25:50.132
Birth dad.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.843
And whatever you thought
was happening here--

25:54.053 --> 25:55.096
It's over.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.226
We're not really gonna lose
our cottage if Daddy loses,

26:00.309 --> 26:02.937
- Right, Mom?
- No, sweetie.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.355
Just our dignity.

26:04.438 --> 26:06.524
Oh, my God.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.234
Pick it up.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.527
Okay.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.004
What the fuck?

26:29.755 --> 26:30.798
Tilt!

26:38.264 --> 26:40.099
Don't forget to brace.

26:42.727 --> 26:44.186
Oh, nope!

26:49.400 --> 26:51.277
- Oh, shit.
- Seriously?

26:51.360 --> 26:52.945
That was disappointing.

26:53.029 --> 26:55.489
- Ah, I'm gonna grab a beer.
- See?

26:58.826 --> 27:00.494
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:00.578 --> 27:01.996
I don't think
anyone saw you vomit

27:02.079 --> 27:03.497
when you hit the water.

27:03.581 --> 27:05.249
I think there's
a good chance that

27:05.333 --> 27:08.044
Wayne and Jane posted
my Tilt a Hurl online.

27:09.337 --> 27:10.713
Thank you

27:10.796 --> 27:13.424
from saving me
from getting saved.

27:13.507 --> 27:15.092
You know I'm still
going to baptize your ass

27:15.176 --> 27:16.218
in the lake, right?

27:25.936 --> 27:28.272
What happened in Australia?

27:28.356 --> 27:29.815
Why'd you come back?

27:29.899 --> 27:32.526
My ex became
a Buddhist and, you know,

27:32.610 --> 27:34.320
I could deal with
the meditating

27:34.403 --> 27:36.739
but it was the chlamydia
that started to feel personal.

27:37.865 --> 27:41.619
But if he hadn't banged
half of Bondi Beach, then...

27:41.702 --> 27:43.287
I wouldn't be here with you.

27:43.371 --> 27:45.456
So, thanks, Chris.

27:46.957 --> 27:49.502
Okay, it's your turn.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.754
Why'd your parents want
to send you to Bible camp?

27:52.380 --> 27:55.174
Oh. Uh...

27:55.257 --> 27:58.427
A few sexts
accidentally uploading

27:58.511 --> 28:00.513
to the family cloud may
have convinced them

28:00.596 --> 28:02.264
it was time to reconnect
with my birth story.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.600
Ooh, I thought it was
because you got arrested

28:04.683 --> 28:06.977
- at that climate march.
- Oh no, they were proud of that

28:07.061 --> 28:09.814
but my booty shots
to Jared, not so much.

28:09.897 --> 28:11.440
Well, it's hard to
get the lighting right.

28:11.524 --> 28:13.109
I mean,
even Captain America made

28:13.192 --> 28:14.610
his pretty dinky look shrinky.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.612
Such a stupid way
to get them to notice me.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.198
We've all sexted a Jared.

28:19.281 --> 28:21.909
What was he, like, a DJ?
Or a snowboarder?

28:21.992 --> 28:23.619
Leader of
my activist youth circle.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.079
Fuck.

28:25.162 --> 28:26.872
I'm so old.

28:27.998 --> 28:29.625
Well,
if your parents sent you here,

28:29.708 --> 28:31.544
he must be either 40 or 12.

28:31.627 --> 28:33.003
Ew. 22.

28:33.087 --> 28:34.547
And he starts
grad school in the fall.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.298
Because that's why
you sent those pics?

28:36.382 --> 28:38.509
For his big... brain?

28:40.803 --> 28:43.514
But if you hadn't
sent him child porn,

28:43.597 --> 28:44.890
then you wouldn't be here.

28:44.974 --> 28:47.476
So thanks, Jared.

28:47.560 --> 28:48.811
Who's Jared.

28:49.645 --> 28:50.771
Oh, um...

28:52.523 --> 28:55.192
Uh, he's my, um--
my weed dealer.

28:55.276 --> 28:57.194
God, wished he delivered.

28:57.278 --> 28:59.822
Hangovers. Ah. Right?

29:01.282 --> 29:04.577
Um, Mom wanted me to give you
some of your dad's old stuff.

29:04.660 --> 29:07.079
- Hey, thanks.
- Mm-hm.

29:10.624 --> 29:12.126
Don't get
into drinking contests

29:12.209 --> 29:13.544
with Kerri, Terri or Jerri.

29:13.627 --> 29:15.087
Olive's the weak link.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.299
Right.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.553
Holy shit, I think
he just proposed to you in boy.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.388
His family stole our cottage.

29:25.139 --> 29:27.057
But maybe there's regret

29:27.141 --> 29:29.435
and a sound environmental
policy under those abs.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.146
Now you're
too young to daydream,

29:32.229 --> 29:34.315
so you need a project. Go.

29:34.398 --> 29:36.025
Make out town is that way.

29:45.367 --> 29:48.829
Killian! Killian!

29:48.913 --> 29:50.080
Ugh.

30:01.842 --> 30:03.135
Hey, I found this.

30:07.348 --> 30:09.475
Are you okay?

30:09.558 --> 30:11.185
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:11.268 --> 30:12.311
Great.

30:15.397 --> 30:17.149
Didn't you shove that
down your pants yesterday?

30:21.570 --> 30:23.405
My grandpa made it.

30:23.489 --> 30:26.200
My grandma taught me
to needlepoint at the cottage.

30:26.992 --> 30:30.037
So, we'd embroider when
it rained. And my dad...

30:30.120 --> 30:32.289
hated it.

30:32.373 --> 30:33.958
You know, because
he thought I should be out

30:34.041 --> 30:36.627
catching frogs
or pissing on shit

30:36.710 --> 30:39.171
or doing whatever it is
that little straight boys do.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.591
But then when grandma died,

30:42.675 --> 30:45.636
my grandpa let me teach him
the petit point and it just...

30:46.637 --> 30:48.681
It just kept her alive for us.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.811
"There once
was a man from Chile,

30:53.894 --> 30:56.105
with holes down
the length of his willy.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.274
When he got an erection,
he could play a selection

30:58.357 --> 31:00.401
of the opera Aida by Verdi?"

31:01.777 --> 31:03.153
Um...

31:03.237 --> 31:06.282
He was a little racist.

31:13.455 --> 31:15.374
So where's Killian.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.376
Oh, he's gone already.

31:17.459 --> 31:19.920
Think this fell out
of the box he brought us?

31:26.302 --> 31:28.345
It's an addendum to Dad's will.

31:28.429 --> 31:29.597
What?

31:31.181 --> 31:33.017
Maisie doesn't own the cottage.

31:34.518 --> 31:36.270
It's in a trust.

31:36.353 --> 31:38.689
And if she ever leaves...

31:41.358 --> 31:43.277
it passes to me.

31:43.360 --> 31:46.447
Your dad changed his will so
you could get the cottage back.

31:46.530 --> 31:49.575
No. I-- I doubt it.
I mean, I begged him,

31:49.658 --> 31:51.535
I begged him
not to sell the cottage.

31:51.619 --> 31:53.912
And then he said to me, "Well,
if keeping it in the family

31:53.996 --> 31:55.748
was so important to you,
then why'd you give up

31:55.831 --> 31:57.207
- my only grandkid?"
- Dark.

31:57.291 --> 31:59.084
If we could get Maisie
to leave...

31:59.960 --> 32:01.629
Like if we could find
the right push...

32:01.712 --> 32:02.921
Like off a dock?

32:03.005 --> 32:04.089
Well, no.
She's a varsity swimmer.

32:04.173 --> 32:06.133
We'd have to hold her under.

32:06.216 --> 32:08.510
We need to give Maisie
a reason to leave.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.054
And then what?

32:10.137 --> 32:15.309
And then
we take back what's ours.

32:15.392 --> 32:19.688
Because your birth dad
ain't nobody's bitch.

32:23.651 --> 32:25.027
Mm!

32:42.961 --> 32:44.380
Hey!
