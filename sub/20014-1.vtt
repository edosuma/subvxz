06:42.774 --> 06:45.263
Hey, back to the bar, Tony.
Stop harassing the newbies.

06:45.343 --> 06:48.333
- What, I'm cleaning enough panties.
- You're on tonight, Tina, get ready.

06:48.413 --> 06:50.835
- I don't know, Blue Jean.
- Last chance, sweetie.

06:50.915 --> 06:53.138
- We gonna see some titty balls tonight?
- If you're lucky.

06:53.218 --> 06:57.031
You don't know how sick I feel
every single day I see you...

06:57.111 --> 06:58.676
...working in my fucking kitchen.

06:58.756 --> 07:01.079
Play nice, Farmer John. You need anything?

07:01.159 --> 07:04.818
A new kitchen staff. You're worthless and weak.

07:13.504 --> 07:17.495
- Just won't give up, will you, Tony?
- This just came in, boss, for you.

07:17.575 --> 07:19.399
No card?

07:32.622 --> 07:35.682
- Jean.
- Secret admirer.

07:58.015 --> 07:59.939
Blue, help me.

08:01.652 --> 08:04.142
You're such a fucking child, Frankie.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.811
Right, says the girl wearing a diaper.

08:06.891 --> 08:09.678
Well, it makes more money
than your face does.

08:10.662 --> 08:12.552
Nice flowers.

08:15.165 --> 08:16.945
How ya feeling, Red?

08:17.025 --> 08:19.757
Wow, those are gorgeous. Who are they from?

08:19.837 --> 08:21.892
No idea, you can have 'em.

08:32.982 --> 08:34.592
Junior.

08:37.121 --> 08:38.885
Sorry, ladies.

08:39.856 --> 08:41.748
Chromagnum's here.

08:43.493 --> 08:46.786
- Let him fester for a bit.
- Your office.

08:51.134 --> 08:54.161
Shall I bring Junior
out of retirement for this one?

08:56.491 --> 08:59.464
- Can you fix it?
- Again?

08:59.544 --> 09:02.568
What are you cutting through? Adamantium?

09:03.747 --> 09:05.970
Probably just needs some oil.

09:06.050 --> 09:08.406
So, you guys got any big plans.

09:08.486 --> 09:11.643
Yeah, probably gonna open up
my own chainsaw repair business.

09:14.224 --> 09:16.281
You gonna get back into fighting?

09:16.861 --> 09:19.719
Nah, those days are behind me.

09:20.998 --> 09:22.626
Time to settle down.

09:25.803 --> 09:27.962
Think you're ready for the big leagues?

09:30.507 --> 09:32.540
<i>Let's hear it for Nasty Nanda.</i>

09:32.620 --> 09:34.916
<i>She's got the longest tongue in town...</i>

09:34.996 --> 09:37.602
<i>...and she makes the best bitching rummies.</i>

09:37.682 --> 09:40.941
- What's this for?
- To clean yourself up.

09:52.496 --> 09:54.919
- Wasting your time.
- Why?

09:54.999 --> 09:58.456
What I hear, she's more than
your Nazi tit regime can handle.

09:58.536 --> 10:00.392
What do you mean?

10:00.772 --> 10:02.662
What do you mean?

10:11.816 --> 10:13.671
Somebody order some pizza?

10:13.751 --> 10:16.077
Nice try, pervert.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.443
- Thanks, sweetie.
- I have to talk to you.

10:18.523 --> 10:20.511
No, not now, Tony.

10:39.977 --> 10:42.266
What the fuck are you doing?

10:42.346 --> 10:45.638
I can't help it. Baby loves this stuff.

10:49.780 --> 10:51.209
Pizza?

10:51.289 --> 10:54.479
- No thanks.
- Is newbie aware of all the rules?

10:54.559 --> 10:58.750
There's really only one rule to follow.
We have a strict touch and go policy.

10:58.830 --> 11:01.352
As in, they touch you, they go.

11:01.432 --> 11:03.772
So tell Tony or Remy
and they'll take care of it.

11:04.302 --> 11:07.225
Or do yourself a favor
and invest in boxing lessons.

11:07.305 --> 11:09.128
Just ask Remy.

11:10.107 --> 11:11.863
He's an awesome trainer.

11:11.943 --> 11:15.800
Or you could be lazy and stupid
and spend the money on a Beretta.

11:15.880 --> 11:18.836
- You're packing heat?
- You went through my stuff?

11:18.916 --> 11:20.398
Why do you need the gun anyway?

11:20.478 --> 11:23.207
You can kick the shit out
of anyone with your baby bottle.

11:23.287 --> 11:25.546
Keep it off the floor, Elaine.

11:40.437 --> 11:42.494
See something you like?

11:42.774 --> 11:45.697
Got some nice, youngin's there, Ms. Murdock.

11:45.777 --> 11:47.098
It's Douglas.

11:47.178 --> 11:49.869
- Well, I thought...
- You thought wrong.

11:50.847 --> 11:54.105
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, just came to...

11:54.185 --> 11:57.443
...dot a few I's, cross a few T's.

11:59.673 --> 12:01.513
My chair.

12:03.894 --> 12:06.953
- My chair soon.
- Not 'til closing.

12:13.270 --> 12:14.880
No matter.

12:15.172 --> 12:17.375
Won't be much of anything soon enough.

12:17.455 --> 12:19.664
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

12:20.494 --> 12:23.300
Enjoy your last night, Ms. Douglas.

12:24.415 --> 12:28.683
Hey, you wouldn't wanna throw in that
motorbike of yours? Part of the deal?

12:28.763 --> 12:31.844
- I'll make it worth your while.
- No deal.

12:32.455 --> 12:35.513
How does a small town stripper...

12:35.793 --> 12:39.550
...come into possession
of a state issued motorbike.

12:39.630 --> 12:43.087
- Santa Clause.
- Santa Clause.

12:44.667 --> 12:47.325
Yeah, right.

12:48.438 --> 12:49.962
Jackal.

13:04.587 --> 13:07.912
- Watch it.
- It was an accident, <i>compadre.</i>

13:07.992 --> 13:09.282
So was he.

13:11.595 --> 13:14.219
- Jesus.
- Yes?

13:14.799 --> 13:17.826
- Get the fuck out of my way.
- I prefer Jesus!

13:40.537 --> 13:42.250
What'd he want?

13:42.330 --> 13:44.081
Mark his territory.

13:44.161 --> 13:46.344
I assume you told him where he could go.

13:50.267 --> 13:52.291
What is it?

13:53.386 --> 13:57.428
Something he said. I think he's just
gonna tear this whole place down.

13:57.508 --> 14:01.309
What do you care? You'll be gone before
they clean the first cum stain off the wall.

14:01.679 --> 14:03.769
Remy, be nice.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.193
Just putting it in perspective.

14:08.551 --> 14:10.075
Hey.

14:10.520 --> 14:15.182
Don't let that fucking bean bag destroy
all the great memories of this place.

14:39.683 --> 14:41.914
Still no word from Logan?

14:42.752 --> 14:46.010
- Nope.
- He'll be here.

14:46.090 --> 14:50.149
He's got a knack for showing up
when you least expect it.

14:51.675 --> 14:54.505
Look, why don't you go outside, get some air.

14:54.865 --> 14:56.756
It'll do you good.

15:06.017 --> 15:09.465
<b>Hey, look, they've got Panuche's
family portrait up on the wall!</b>

15:10.890 --> 15:14.571
Excuse me, <i>señorita</i>.
What's with the animal hall of fame?

15:14.651 --> 15:16.229
That's our menu board.

15:17.921 --> 15:20.077
You serve bear?

15:20.157 --> 15:22.546
It's delicious.
Our head chef hunts it himself.

15:22.626 --> 15:25.628
Mario won't eat anything that hairy,
except for maybe his wife.

15:28.432 --> 15:32.356
- So what can I get you, guys?
- A round of the spirit ale, please.

15:32.936 --> 15:35.626
- Can I have a salad, please.
- A salad.

15:35.706 --> 15:39.531
Don't forget to order a set of <i>cojones</i>
to replace the pair you are missing.

15:42.380 --> 15:45.806
- Can you turn up the heat, please?
- Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

15:48.943 --> 15:50.812
<b>Your leg?</b>

15:52.798 --> 15:55.956
<b>It's fine, boss. Just need a drink.</b>

15:58.148 --> 15:59.515
<b>So, what are we gonna do?</b>

15:59.975 --> 16:01.485
<b>About what?</b>

16:01.565 --> 16:04.057
<b>You know... the oil.</b>

16:05.585 --> 16:08.872
<b>Relax, Pablo. No one gives a shit.</b>

16:08.952 --> 16:11.391
<b>Not when there's ass and tits around.</b>

16:11.977 --> 16:13.539
<b>Besides, I thought we already decided.</b>

16:14.181 --> 16:15.988
<b>We did?</b>

16:18.866 --> 16:21.752
<b>Look, let's have a few drinks to celebrate
and we'll figure it out later.</b>

16:21.832 --> 16:23.459
<b>I like the sound of that.</b>

16:31.561 --> 16:33.619
Tequila, pronto!

16:45.742 --> 16:47.498
Strike one.

16:47.578 --> 16:49.607
Travis, get off the bike, man.

16:49.687 --> 16:51.170
Relax.

16:54.317 --> 16:57.975
Hey, Blue Jean. I was just
showing my buddy here your bike.

16:58.155 --> 17:00.368
He didn't believe me
that you owned a pig chopper.

17:00.448 --> 17:04.548
That's one sweet ride. How the hell
did you get your hands on this?

17:04.627 --> 17:06.598
Police auction.

17:07.097 --> 17:09.053
I call bullshit.

17:09.133 --> 17:10.890
I call happy hour.

17:12.469 --> 17:14.657
How much you want for it?

17:14.738 --> 17:16.426
It's not for sale.

17:16.507 --> 17:19.566
If you want, I have a nice
little scooter I could show you.

17:23.413 --> 17:26.303
Well, hey, everything's
got a price, don't it?

17:26.383 --> 17:28.207
Even you.

17:29.386 --> 17:31.308
Jesus Christ, Travis.

17:31.388 --> 17:32.937
Strike two.

17:33.017 --> 17:34.912
No, you're right.

17:35.492 --> 17:38.966
Just let me ask you,
how much is your dick worth?

17:40.530 --> 17:43.320
- Excuse me?
- Well, everything has a price, don't it?

17:43.400 --> 17:47.808
And, since you don't use yours very often,
I'm wondering how much it's worth to you.

17:51.742 --> 17:53.631
Alright, let's go.

17:54.411 --> 17:58.036
Chill the fuck out, Travis. Do you wanna
leave here with your balls tonight?

17:59.316 --> 18:02.440
Mike, put it back where you found it, okay?

18:02.520 --> 18:07.081
Sure thing, Blue Jean. Sorry about that,
I thought he'd be a bit more appreciative.

18:11.327 --> 18:12.767
Hey.

18:13.097 --> 18:14.754
No harm done, right?

18:16.699 --> 18:18.073
BJ.

18:30.747 --> 18:33.405
Strike three, you're out.

18:34.550 --> 18:37.009
Nobody calls her BJ, dipshit.

18:42.025 --> 18:45.217
- Everything okay?
- You're right, a little fresh air did help.

18:46.597 --> 18:49.458
- What did you do?
- You fucking cunt!

18:53.644 --> 18:56.162
That's no way to talk to a lady.

18:58.576 --> 18:59.864
Thanks, buddy.

18:59.944 --> 19:02.200
Would you like me to take out the garbage?

19:03.280 --> 19:04.770
Be my guest.

19:05.698 --> 19:07.540
Suck my dick.

19:13.489 --> 19:15.547
Let's get this party started.

19:16.193 --> 19:21.001
<i>Remember, we have pitchers
of spirit ale for half price tonight.</i>

19:21.081 --> 19:24.755
So what's the deal with Remy
and Blue Jean? Are they a couple.

19:24.835 --> 19:26.258
Nah.

19:26.803 --> 19:29.231
He's had blue balls since the day they met.

19:31.008 --> 19:35.165
<i>Alright, gentlemen, you've waited
a while for this special lady.</i>

19:35.245 --> 19:40.397
<i>It's that time, the only woman
who can make diapers look sexy...</i>

19:40.477 --> 19:43.140
<i>...it's Baby!</i>

20:21.824 --> 20:23.883
Here. Drink this.

20:40.644 --> 20:43.257
Hey. Thanks for your help.

20:43.337 --> 20:44.835
My pleasure.

20:45.115 --> 20:48.672
- Nice shoes.
- Yeah, they're full of surprises.

20:48.752 --> 20:51.842
- How's that hand?
- Yeah, I think that bastard beat me.

20:51.922 --> 20:54.518
- You want ice?
- I'm okay, thanks.

20:54.598 --> 20:56.481
He's okay.

20:57.761 --> 20:59.316
Cute hat.

20:59.396 --> 21:02.822
Yeah, that's his lucky hat.
He won't enter the mines without it.

21:07.470 --> 21:10.730
Please excuse me. I have to use the bathroom.

21:13.442 --> 21:15.599
So you guys working over at Pisha Ranch Mine?

21:15.679 --> 21:18.252
- Yeah.
- How come I haven't seen you here before?

21:18.332 --> 21:21.071
- Hector runs a tight ship.
- Yeah, but not tonight.

21:21.151 --> 21:24.375
- Tonight we're celebrating.
- What are we celebrating?

21:24.455 --> 21:26.523
- Well...
- It's the cowboy's birthday.

21:28.191 --> 21:31.151
We'll have to plan something
a little extra special for him tonight.

21:36.600 --> 21:37.931
Aja, aren't you going up tonight?

21:38.011 --> 21:40.758
They're slammed. They just got
a shitload of orders for the house special.

21:40.838 --> 21:42.993
- What's the house special?
- Muffin turf.

21:43.073 --> 21:45.263
20 bucks for a steak and a flash of pussy.

21:54.784 --> 21:57.164
No one orders the salad, sweetheart.

21:57.244 --> 21:59.143
His wife put him on a diet.

21:59.223 --> 22:02.947
If his stomach gets any bigger,
she won't be able to find his dick.

22:04.561 --> 22:07.020
Alright, you boys behave yourselves.

22:10.333 --> 22:14.778
There's something wrong with the beer.
Can we get a round of Tequila instead?

23:27.277 --> 23:30.049
<i>Get ready for what Baby has to offer.</i>

23:39.596 --> 23:43.015
<i>And what a beautiful specimen she is, folks.</i>

23:47.498 --> 23:51.990
<i>And, luckily, Baby can do
her own breast-feeding.</i>

23:53.970 --> 23:56.593
<i>Keep it going for our beautiful Baby.</i>

23:56.673 --> 23:59.732
<i>We know that's the cradle you'd like to rob.</i>

24:03.446 --> 24:06.069
Muffin turf? Really, guys?

24:06.149 --> 24:08.155
Don't look at me.

24:08.385 --> 24:10.708
Tony, you're watching Tina
when she goes up tonight.

24:10.788 --> 24:14.445
Apparently her boyfriend's a jealous douche,
God knows when he'll show up.

24:15.125 --> 24:17.147
Why can't Remy watch Tina?

24:17.227 --> 24:20.118
Remy's at the door, is there a problem?

24:21.398 --> 24:23.682
Are her boobs safe?

24:25.234 --> 24:28.025
As long as they get to the bag
before the tag, yeah, they're safe.

24:28.105 --> 24:31.195
What I mean is, do they
have any freaky shit going on?

24:31.275 --> 24:33.611
You know, I can't handle funky nipples.

24:33.691 --> 24:37.570
Yeah, Tony, it can't be
as bad as your funky penis.

24:39.882 --> 24:41.941
What's wrong with my penis?

26:13.345 --> 26:16.558
<i>Somebody get that girl another diaper.</i>

26:26.992 --> 26:29.170
How am I supposed to top that?

26:29.860 --> 26:33.419
Easy. Just take a big shit on stage.

26:41.012 --> 26:42.313
<b>You okay, buddy?</b>

26:45.274 --> 26:48.265
<i>We're gonna take a quick break so you
lushes can refill those cocktails...</i>

26:48.345 --> 26:50.569
<i>...but don't go too far.</i>

27:16.939 --> 27:18.463
Panuche?

27:40.129 --> 27:42.653
And the crowd goes wild.

27:42.733 --> 27:45.656
- You really pissed yourself?
- I piss myself all the time.

27:45.736 --> 27:47.592
It's no biggie.

27:48.772 --> 27:51.061
- Newbie's up.
- Okay, time to go.

27:51.141 --> 27:54.998
<i>We've got a virgin, let's not scare her off.</i>

27:55.078 --> 27:57.401
<i>It's Tina.</i>

30:12.014 --> 30:13.538
Hands.

30:51.053 --> 30:54.279
- Hands, please.
- What, I didn't?

31:13.787 --> 31:16.798
You disgusting little pervert.

31:28.824 --> 31:31.748
- Where the hell have you been?
- Nice of you to care.

31:31.828 --> 31:35.218
- You know this is an important night for me.
- Yeah, for me too.

31:35.298 --> 31:38.355
- Why do you have to make this so hard?
- You're the one who's skipping town.

31:38.435 --> 31:41.501
- Logan, we've been through this.
- It always ends up with you getting your way.

31:41.581 --> 31:43.627
- Hey, sexy.
- Hey, gorgeous.

31:43.707 --> 31:46.463
- You get that brown belt yet?
- You had any doubt?

31:46.543 --> 31:49.599
Frankie, me and Logan are just
in the middle of something.

31:49.679 --> 31:51.905
Well, don't be hogging him all night.

31:54.616 --> 31:57.427
You're just like your dad,
getting the ladies all hot and bothered.

31:57.507 --> 32:01.179
Yeah? But he knew who the keepers were.

32:04.928 --> 32:07.584
- That's my cue.
- What did he do?

32:07.664 --> 32:10.355
- Long story.
- My office.

32:31.227 --> 32:32.822
<b>You alright, dude?</b>

32:32.902 --> 32:35.125
<b>I just need some air.</b>

32:53.495 --> 32:56.666
Evening, Carl. Come buy our closing night?

32:56.746 --> 32:59.836
Blue, you know, it's not gonna be
the same around here without ya.

32:59.916 --> 33:02.706
I'm sure you'll find another
place to harass and annoy.

33:02.786 --> 33:07.044
The officers here were looking for Logan.

33:08.424 --> 33:12.167
- Is there a problem?
- Probably be best if we chat with him.

33:21.403 --> 33:24.569
- What's going on, Carl?
- Tell me, Blue.

33:47.496 --> 33:51.855
- He stole a car?
- Not just any car, a Cruiser.

33:52.135 --> 33:54.157
Jesus Christ.

33:54.237 --> 33:58.071
I know Logan's had a hard time
of it, ever since Lucas.

34:00.843 --> 34:03.833
Look, he's a good kid.
He's too smart for his own good.

34:03.913 --> 34:06.833
College has really put his head
in the right place.

34:08.917 --> 34:10.341
Tina. What are...

34:11.072 --> 34:13.275
- What are you doing here? Tina?
- Go home.

34:13.356 --> 34:15.197
Go home! Get off.

34:15.277 --> 34:16.781
Get off the stage!

34:18.377 --> 34:21.219
- Tony!
- I'm on it!

34:21.627 --> 34:23.659
Get off the stage, come on.

34:23.998 --> 34:26.703
Looks like you got your hands full.
You got it covered?

34:27.003 --> 34:29.621
Closing night, could it be any different?

34:30.507 --> 34:32.330
Come on.

34:32.741 --> 34:34.831
Come on, come on.

34:40.649 --> 34:44.774
<i>Okay, gentlemen, most of you
know her as our little feisty Frankie...</i>

34:44.853 --> 34:50.114
<i>...but tonight, she goes
by the name of Thundercunt!</i>

35:01.803 --> 35:03.646
Come on.

35:03.729 --> 35:05.495
Stuey, stop it, you're embarrassing me.

35:05.575 --> 35:09.414
I'm not the one standing around with
her tits hanging out for the world to see.

35:15.377 --> 35:16.940
Tina!

35:47.883 --> 35:49.774
Oh, my God!

35:50.819 --> 35:52.343
Fuck.

35:52.854 --> 35:55.345
I... I had him.

35:56.058 --> 35:58.180
You had who?

35:58.260 --> 36:01.049
I don't know. I don't know.

36:01.129 --> 36:02.799
- He was so strong.
- Who?

36:02.879 --> 36:07.143
I don't know. I don't know,
he was... he was black.

36:07.503 --> 36:08.725
He was black?

36:08.805 --> 36:12.802
No, no. He was covered in black.

36:13.709 --> 36:16.900
I don't know, he was covered in oil.

36:16.980 --> 36:20.203
Slimy, cold, ice cold.

36:21.116 --> 36:22.775
He slipped out of my hands.

36:30.792 --> 36:32.705
- We need to get Carl in here.
- Hold on.

36:32.785 --> 36:35.585
- What?
- Just hold on, wait a second.

36:35.665 --> 36:38.258
- What?
- I need to check something out.

36:38.338 --> 36:41.257
- Wait, what?
- Guys, clean this up.

36:41.337 --> 36:44.362
- What?
- And go get Carl, pussy.

36:45.273 --> 36:46.797
Fuck!

36:59.054 --> 37:01.578
- You're kidding me, right?
- What?

37:01.658 --> 37:04.716
I am surprised you didn't drive
here in the stolen Cruiser.

37:07.095 --> 37:10.337
No. If you think that
just because you and I...

37:13.285 --> 37:15.292
What the hell was that?

37:15.822 --> 37:17.248
Thundercunt?

37:34.156 --> 37:36.112
What the fuck now?

37:36.192 --> 37:38.964
- Bar fight.
- Motherfuckers.

38:08.056 --> 38:11.345
Hey, I won't pick up any puke
from those sons of a bitches...

38:11.425 --> 38:15.184
- ...if they make a mess in there.
- Relax, Farmer. It's just temporary.

38:15.264 --> 38:19.088
Yeah? Thankfully, so is this fucking job.

38:19.168 --> 38:22.828
Look, go downstairs, get something
to clean all this up with.

38:24.856 --> 38:28.739
Hey, tell that beautiful boss
of ours I run out of turf here.

38:29.312 --> 38:32.336
And somebody stole my fucking carving knife.

38:46.328 --> 38:48.251
Where are your friends?

38:48.331 --> 38:50.920
- What?
- Your friends, where are they?

38:51.000 --> 38:54.472
- In the bathroom, why?
- Somebody attacked one of my girls.

38:55.438 --> 38:59.297
- None of my guys would do that.
- He was covered in oil.

39:01.476 --> 39:04.369
Pisha Ranch Mine, that's a coal mine, right?

39:07.082 --> 39:08.606
Right?

39:09.651 --> 39:12.343
- Yeah.
- <i>Petróleo.</i>

39:12.821 --> 39:16.179
Oil? What's oil doing in a coal mine?

39:16.559 --> 39:18.583
Seems pretty strange to me.

39:21.129 --> 39:24.756
Then again, you're not celebrating
someone's birthday here tonight, are you?

39:27.002 --> 39:29.026
Start talking.

39:31.273 --> 39:33.096
My crew.

39:35.010 --> 39:37.233
<i>It was the end of our shift.</i>

39:37.713 --> 39:40.138
<i>We were the last ones down there.</i>

39:47.961 --> 39:49.567
<b>- Hey, pal.
- What's up?</b>

39:50.179 --> 39:52.309
<b>- You're looking thinner, man.
- Really?</b>

39:52.399 --> 39:54.376
<b>Yeah, thinner than a cow.</b>

39:55.040 --> 39:58.320
<b>Stop fooling around! Back to work!</b>

40:23.592 --> 40:25.029
<i>Santa Maria.</i>

40:27.309 --> 40:29.128
<b>Guys, look!</b>

40:31.039 --> 40:32.589
<b>Oil!</b>

40:39.575 --> 40:41.378
<b>Did you shit yourself?</b>

40:41.818 --> 40:43.954
<b>Look, we're rich!</b>

40:44.434 --> 40:46.724
<b>That smells worse than a burro's ass.</b>

40:48.972 --> 40:50.548
<b>Is it oil?</b>

40:50.628 --> 40:53.348
<b>Of course. What else?</b>

40:58.646 --> 40:59.843
<b>Run!</b>

41:18.086 --> 41:19.959
<b>You okay, buddy?</b>

41:21.975 --> 41:23.839
<b>Yeah, I'm good.</b>

41:30.017 --> 41:32.106
<b>That's the smell of money!</b>

41:40.235 --> 41:42.558
We were going to go back tomorrow...

41:42.638 --> 41:44.873
...excavate the site...

41:45.884 --> 41:47.973
...start to extract the oil.

41:51.179 --> 41:53.491
But it isn't oil, is it?

42:02.023 --> 42:05.081
- What the fuck is going on?
- It's not oil.

42:05.161 --> 42:08.453
Yeah, so? What's that mean?

42:10.812 --> 42:13.136
I think it's something toxic, I don't know.

42:13.936 --> 42:15.760
I don't follow.

42:18.673 --> 42:20.763
Well, remember what Tony said.

42:20.843 --> 42:23.366
Oily and slimy to the touch.

42:23.446 --> 42:27.638
So what are you saying? Striking oil
suddenly makes you a violent killer?

42:34.072 --> 42:35.946
What the fuck?

43:15.197 --> 43:16.640
No!

43:44.926 --> 43:47.385
Okay, this is not good.

43:48.864 --> 43:51.355
- I think we should...
- It's too late!

43:57.739 --> 44:01.314
- Something else I got from Dad, good aim.
- What the hell are you doing with this?

44:01.394 --> 44:03.200
It's not mine.

44:12.927 --> 44:14.778
This one is.

44:17.826 --> 44:20.349
What the fuck? Give it back.
Did you see what I just did?

44:20.429 --> 44:22.552
- Hey, we all get lucky once in a while.
- Lucky?

44:22.632 --> 44:26.850
Enough, both of you, put the measuring tapes
away. We have to get everyone out of here.

44:29.971 --> 44:32.528
What the fuck's wrong with these guys?
There's black shit all over them.

44:32.608 --> 44:34.867
I don't know, just don't touch them.

44:39.047 --> 44:42.338
- Okay, hold on to this, sharpshooter.
- It's empty.

44:42.418 --> 44:45.074
Very good. I'm going to get the others.

44:45.154 --> 44:47.743
- I'm coming with you.
- No, stay here with the boys.

44:47.823 --> 44:50.000
Look, I'll be right back.

44:50.080 --> 44:54.120
Just make sure you get everyone
out of here safely.

44:56.698 --> 44:58.589
It's weird.

44:58.700 --> 45:01.093
Really, which part?

45:01.173 --> 45:05.194
- I shot that guy.
- Wow. He's quick, folks.

45:05.274 --> 45:08.230
No, I mean, I already shot him,
like, three times in Blue Jean's office.

45:08.310 --> 45:12.203
- There's no way he could have survived.
- Sharpshooter my ass.

45:13.815 --> 45:17.473
Alright, everybody, listen up, we need
to get everybody out of the bar now.

45:17.553 --> 45:19.875
I can't work under these fucking conditions.

45:19.955 --> 45:23.112
I think it sounded crazy out there,
so I suggest you get out there...

45:23.192 --> 45:28.085
...do you fucking job like you get paid to,
and see what the hell is going on.

45:52.821 --> 45:56.647
Come on, everybody, clear out,
come on. Come on, let's go.

46:02.664 --> 46:04.954
Should we call for backup or something?

46:05.634 --> 46:09.392
Well, Logan's dead girlfriend and Carl here
make up for the entire backup in this town.

46:09.772 --> 46:12.198
Next closest cop is an hour and a half away.

46:12.808 --> 46:17.251
Welcome to the boonies,
population 5,000 and dropping.

46:18.913 --> 46:21.437
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

46:21.517 --> 46:24.173
This can't be happening.
This cannot be happening.

46:24.253 --> 46:26.975
Frankie. Frankie, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey. Hey.

46:27.055 --> 46:29.578
Look at me, okay? Look at me.

46:29.658 --> 46:33.082
Remember what I taught you, okay?
You're in control.

46:33.162 --> 46:34.895
Always, okay?

46:36.331 --> 46:38.388
Hey, hey, hey.

46:39.334 --> 46:42.592
Come here, come here. Sit down.

46:44.939 --> 46:47.965
Try to breathe, now. Take a deep breath.

46:55.049 --> 46:56.624
Keep doing that.

46:57.418 --> 47:00.209
Hey, blondie. A little help here.

47:00.289 --> 47:03.346
- Something's not right.
- He's dead, Logan.

47:03.626 --> 47:05.449
Are you sure?

47:12.701 --> 47:14.391
Satisfied?

47:16.004 --> 47:19.949
Why don't you make yourself useful, okay,
and move some of these bodies out of the way?

47:20.709 --> 47:22.566
You start with him.

47:45.934 --> 47:47.792
Yeah, I don't think so.

48:00.615 --> 48:02.506
Fucking dumbass.

48:06.087 --> 48:08.844
- What the fuck is going out there?
- Put some clothes on, we're leaving.

48:08.924 --> 48:10.746
- What, why?
- Hey, Blue.

48:10.826 --> 48:12.515
- Hey, Momma Bear.
- What's going on.

48:12.595 --> 48:14.083
I need you to get ready, we're leaving.

48:14.163 --> 48:16.171
Why won't you let me sleep
through the last night?

48:16.251 --> 48:18.887
What the hell is going on out there, Blue?

48:18.967 --> 48:22.725
- Where's Junior?
- Hello, are you listening to me?

48:22.805 --> 48:24.028
Elaine!

48:28.544 --> 48:30.367
Go, go!

48:42.190 --> 48:45.778
- Just shoot!
- It's fucking jammed!

48:45.858 --> 48:47.885
Remove the safety!

49:27.535 --> 49:29.392
Is she dead?

50:00.335 --> 50:02.159
Let's go.

50:47.381 --> 50:48.973
Shit.

50:50.953 --> 50:53.344
Come on, back up generator.

50:56.325 --> 50:57.848
Remy!

51:24.820 --> 51:26.423
Shit!

51:44.906 --> 51:47.629
Just can't stay out of trouble, can you?

51:59.887 --> 52:03.011
I told you so, that crazy
motherfucker wasn't dead.

52:03.091 --> 52:06.181
I don't get it. These guys are bulletproof.

52:06.261 --> 52:09.404
And their fucking blood, it's black.

52:09.484 --> 52:13.000
What are they? What's up with you?

52:14.969 --> 52:17.594
- Jesus Christ!
- Remy!

52:18.472 --> 52:22.231
- It's not as bad as it looks.
- No, dude, that looks pretty fucking bad.

52:22.911 --> 52:26.768
Now, we can get you and the girls
out of here. Where's Baby?

52:26.848 --> 52:29.339
- She didn't make it.
- What?

52:31.085 --> 52:32.507
Fuck.

52:32.587 --> 52:34.111
No.

52:34.655 --> 52:36.359
It was one of these miners.

52:37.159 --> 52:40.849
- Where is he now?
- The dressing room. I took care of him.

52:40.929 --> 52:43.296
Okay, so, that's all four of 'em.

52:43.376 --> 52:46.155
- Look...
- Wait, where's Tony?

52:46.235 --> 52:47.955
Shit!

52:48.035 --> 52:49.559
Kitchen.

52:50.872 --> 52:53.605
- Where you going?
- You're not going anywhere.

52:53.685 --> 52:55.481
Well, take the girls with you.

52:55.561 --> 52:58.500
The farther away
from these things the better.

52:58.580 --> 53:01.603
- Hey, what about me?
- I said take the girls.

53:01.683 --> 53:04.153
You're fucking hilarious.
How's that knife feeling?

53:04.233 --> 53:05.776
Jean.

53:06.387 --> 53:10.169
Find Farmer John.
Tell him to bring in the middle reliever.

53:17.898 --> 53:20.358
Now, help me with this fucking knife.

53:30.879 --> 53:32.402
What?

53:32.680 --> 53:34.738
- The baby.
- Now?

53:34.818 --> 53:38.707
- Distract me, distract me.
- Okay.

53:38.787 --> 53:42.177
So far we're being attacked
by this group of infected...

53:42.257 --> 53:46.352
They're fucking psychopathic,
cocksucking killers.

53:50.531 --> 53:52.422
That helped.

53:52.800 --> 53:55.190
Why won't these guys stay down?

53:55.270 --> 53:57.459
What do you mean, won't stay down?

53:57.539 --> 53:59.661
I saw you bash that guy's
head in with your bat.

53:59.741 --> 54:02.032
Yeah, but the others.

54:03.277 --> 54:05.118
Wait a sec.

54:06.181 --> 54:09.438
Just pull it out, fast, as fast as you can.

54:09.518 --> 54:12.274
- Jesus, Remy, that's fucked.
- Kid...

54:12.354 --> 54:14.177
...just get it done.

54:18.059 --> 54:21.350
Count of three. One.

54:21.430 --> 54:23.050
Two.

54:23.130 --> 54:24.654
Three.

54:25.366 --> 54:28.791
- Look, I understand.
- Motherfucker!

54:31.939 --> 54:33.796
You owe me one.

54:34.176 --> 54:36.498
What I owe you is a bitch slap.

54:36.778 --> 54:40.535
Hey, if you want,
I can put the knife back in.

54:40.615 --> 54:44.927
What I want, is for you to stop
fucking up. For Jean's sake.

54:45.007 --> 54:47.442
What the fuck are you talking about?

54:47.522 --> 54:50.212
Stealing a car, carrying a gun.

54:50.492 --> 54:54.107
Look, get the fuck off my ass.
And Blue Jean's too.

54:58.567 --> 55:00.790
For fuck's sakes.

55:05.840 --> 55:07.314
Stay close.

55:07.676 --> 55:09.099
Carla!

55:15.783 --> 55:17.377
Tony?

55:19.688 --> 55:21.578
Blue Jean!

56:01.929 --> 56:03.720
Hey, Tony.

56:07.568 --> 56:09.092
Frankie!

56:38.132 --> 56:39.655
What?

56:41.469 --> 56:43.658
I think I have a name for your baby.

56:43.738 --> 56:44.761
What?

56:45.573 --> 56:46.777
Winnie.

56:52.880 --> 56:56.057
Why... won't... you...

56:56.137 --> 56:58.408
...fucking... die?

57:15.202 --> 57:17.661
- The head!
- What?

57:19.607 --> 57:22.298
The head, shoot 'em in the head.

57:23.278 --> 57:25.502
<i>Adios</i>, motherfucker.

57:27.616 --> 57:28.738
Fuck.

57:38.292 --> 57:39.796
Come on!

57:55.843 --> 57:57.499
Head, dumbass.

57:57.579 --> 57:59.801
He was holding my hand!

57:59.881 --> 58:02.671
That was a bit quick, you just met.

58:02.751 --> 58:04.574
Fuck off.

58:11.792 --> 58:13.150
Now, stay...

58:14.496 --> 58:18.423
Jesus Christ! You cocksuckers
gave Licorice a contraction.

58:18.503 --> 58:20.722
Almost gave me one, too.

58:20.802 --> 58:24.092
We're okay, thanks for asking.

58:24.172 --> 58:25.523
What's that smell?

58:31.745 --> 58:33.760
Jesus, Frankie!

58:41.989 --> 58:43.837
Oh, man.

58:45.359 --> 58:47.182
He was infected too.

58:48.062 --> 58:49.574
We had to stop him.

58:50.931 --> 58:54.222
The head, that's how you stop 'em.

58:54.302 --> 58:57.217
Yeah, so let's finish this.

59:00.557 --> 59:02.105
Wow.

59:05.012 --> 59:08.670
What exactly did Farmer John hunt with this?

59:08.750 --> 59:10.598
I don't wanna know.

59:15.172 --> 59:16.720
Cool.

59:21.562 --> 59:24.012
The hell am I supposed to do with this?

59:52.526 --> 59:55.617
I'll take the lead.
Logan, you follow with Licorice.

59:55.697 --> 59:58.787
Frankie, cover him. Gina, take the rear.

59:58.867 --> 01:00:02.617
Plan is to get the hell out of Dodge before
any of these fuckers get up. If they do...

01:00:02.697 --> 01:00:04.529
...aim for the head.

01:00:04.609 --> 01:00:06.861
Don't touch 'em, don't let 'em touch you.

01:00:06.941 --> 01:00:10.498
Frankie, you know how to use that thing?

01:00:10.578 --> 01:00:12.048
I think so.

01:00:26.727 --> 01:00:28.275
No!

01:00:41.375 --> 01:00:43.725
Well, there goes our head theory.

01:00:52.087 --> 01:00:53.293
Fuck!

01:01:16.543 --> 01:01:18.091
Shit.

01:01:18.612 --> 01:01:20.861
The fuck did they go?

01:01:22.416 --> 01:01:25.299
Why won't these guys fucking die?

01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:52.525
Holy shit.

01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:58.406
I think I got it.

01:01:58.486 --> 01:02:00.033
What?

01:02:00.687 --> 01:02:02.977
These things, they're infected
by some sort of bad oil.

01:02:03.057 --> 01:02:05.567
We can use that to our advantage.

01:02:06.227 --> 01:02:10.085
- Use what to our advantage?
- What do they say about oil and water?

01:02:10.465 --> 01:02:13.388
- They don't mix.
- Exactly.

01:02:13.468 --> 01:02:17.669
Yeah, but the human body
is made up of 60 to 70% water.

01:02:17.749 --> 01:02:23.270
By mass alone, each human cell consists
of somewhere between 65 to 90% H2O.

01:02:25.245 --> 01:02:29.487
- College. Biology is my major.
- Yeah, I used to think you went to class.

01:02:30.418 --> 01:02:33.700
So how is more water going to stop them?
It doesn't make sense.

01:02:38.192 --> 01:02:40.170
Okay, it makes sense.

01:02:47.768 --> 01:02:49.850
Remy, grab a pot.

01:02:56.043 --> 01:02:57.924
What the hell?

01:02:58.679 --> 01:03:00.527
What time is it?

01:03:01.315 --> 01:03:04.477
- Dead after midnight.
- Fuck!

01:03:05.152 --> 01:03:06.141
Shit.

01:03:06.221 --> 01:03:09.504
The fucking prick could wait
until we actually closed.

01:03:11.591 --> 01:03:13.586
They won't stay on for long.

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:17.652
Guys, we need to get out of here now.

01:03:17.832 --> 01:03:20.066
We need another water source.

01:03:21.236 --> 01:03:22.782
Beer.

01:03:23.136 --> 01:03:25.160
It's over 95% water.

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:28.964
Every 12 ounce bottle
has 11.4 ounces of water.

01:03:30.144 --> 01:03:33.569
Bartending school. Alcohol is my major.

01:03:34.015 --> 01:03:37.906
- Farmer John's secret stash.
- Thank you, Farmer John.

01:03:37.986 --> 01:03:42.076
Those things out there,
these oily fuckers, they're contagious.

01:03:42.156 --> 01:03:45.246
We've seen it with Tony.
We can't let 'em leave.

01:03:45.326 --> 01:03:47.348
We have to kill them.

01:03:47.428 --> 01:03:49.200
You guys get that, right?

01:03:56.603 --> 01:04:00.228
Logan. It's not safe for Licorice out there.

01:04:00.308 --> 01:04:03.528
If any of those fuckers get by us,
you've got plenty to hit 'em with.

01:04:04.879 --> 01:04:07.080
Stay strong for Winnie.

01:04:13.553 --> 01:04:15.368
Blue Jean.

01:04:18.692 --> 01:04:21.968
Don't worry, it's just
the seventh inning stretch.

01:04:27.935 --> 01:04:30.818
Hold this 'til I get back, okay?

01:04:33.123 --> 01:04:34.938
Time to go.

01:04:38.078 --> 01:04:39.486
Remy.

01:04:40.547 --> 01:04:42.837
Take care of my mom, okay?

01:04:43.117 --> 01:04:45.131
You got it, kid.

01:04:48.856 --> 01:04:51.709
Here. I believe this belongs to you.

01:04:53.594 --> 01:04:55.108
Sharpshooter.

01:05:10.343 --> 01:05:11.891
Wow.

01:05:12.312 --> 01:05:14.602
Our little boy's all grown up.

01:05:15.682 --> 01:05:17.430
It's hot.

01:05:17.518 --> 01:05:21.935
If I wasn't about to burst,
I'd fuck you right now.

01:05:28.195 --> 01:05:30.585
I'll go in first, slow the motherfucker down.

01:05:30.665 --> 01:05:32.713
Then it's all you.

01:05:35.202 --> 01:05:37.030
You ready?

01:05:41.842 --> 01:05:44.591
Shit, no back up lights in here.

01:05:46.913 --> 01:05:48.985
Jean, open the door.

01:05:56.493 --> 01:05:57.971
Fuck!

01:05:58.793 --> 01:06:00.340
Remy!

01:06:02.096 --> 01:06:03.805
Fuck!

01:06:03.885 --> 01:06:05.267
Jesus...

01:06:05.347 --> 01:06:07.042
...Christ!

01:06:08.435 --> 01:06:10.686
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:06:31.224 --> 01:06:33.039
She'll be back.

01:06:33.827 --> 01:06:35.641
I know.

01:06:36.476 --> 01:06:38.033
She wears it all the time.

01:06:39.766 --> 01:06:42.781
It's not me, LM.

01:06:43.804 --> 01:06:46.419
It's my dad, Lucas.

01:06:48.375 --> 01:06:50.431
Blue Jean never told you?

01:06:50.511 --> 01:06:54.532
I... I just assumed Blue Jean got
knocked up and your dad took off.

01:06:56.276 --> 01:06:59.800
Blue Jean and my dad met,
like, 10 years after my mom died.

01:07:02.055 --> 01:07:04.137
Where's your dad?

01:07:05.859 --> 01:07:07.515
He's dead.

01:07:07.595 --> 01:07:11.077
Oh, Jesus, Logan, I'm so sorry.

01:07:11.765 --> 01:07:14.048
It's the price for being a cop.

01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:19.619
Was that your dad's?

01:07:20.407 --> 01:07:22.330
Actually, it's Blue Jean's.

01:07:22.410 --> 01:07:23.731
What?

01:07:23.811 --> 01:07:26.320
That's how they met, on the job.

01:07:27.814 --> 01:07:30.063
Blue Jean was a cop?

01:07:30.917 --> 01:07:32.732
Let's just say...

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:36.071
...if it was a fight,
I wouldn't want to be the other guy.

01:07:38.591 --> 01:07:40.615
Let's go for beer only.

01:07:40.995 --> 01:07:42.942
None of the hard stuff is gonna...

01:07:58.645 --> 01:08:01.060
Remy, stay down!

01:08:11.825 --> 01:08:14.475
No, don't do it, there's too much blood.

01:08:22.535 --> 01:08:24.377
Did you like the flowers?

01:08:26.171 --> 01:08:28.263
Yeah, they're beautiful.

01:08:28.643 --> 01:08:30.290
Bullshit.

01:08:32.178 --> 01:08:35.505
Fuck. You're always such a guy...

01:08:35.585 --> 01:08:37.639
...and I love you for that.

01:08:38.219 --> 01:08:41.453
But can't you be a girl
just once in a while.

01:08:47.894 --> 01:08:51.109
Bottom of the ninth, two outs.

01:08:51.465 --> 01:08:53.881
Time to bring in the closer, Jean.

01:08:58.939 --> 01:09:01.943
Now be a good girl,
and finish the fucking game.

01:09:26.332 --> 01:09:28.348
About fucking time.

01:09:31.404 --> 01:09:32.952
Remy?

01:09:36.643 --> 01:09:38.191
No.

01:11:14.007 --> 01:11:17.637
This is for Remy, you oily cocksucker.

01:11:43.903 --> 01:11:45.785
Sweet Jesus.

01:11:47.457 --> 01:11:49.289
You bastard!

01:11:50.109 --> 01:11:53.234
- You turned off the power, the water.
- It's my bar now.

01:11:53.314 --> 01:11:55.874
- Not yet.
- It's after midnight...

01:11:55.954 --> 01:11:57.763
...check the fine print.

01:12:00.587 --> 01:12:02.477
We're sitting on an oil mine, aren't we?

01:12:03.497 --> 01:12:06.514
For a small town stripper,
you're fairly quick.

01:12:07.074 --> 01:12:10.551
Well, you're in for a real treat,
because it's anything but oil.

01:12:10.931 --> 01:12:15.089
- It's much worse.
- On the contrary, all the better.

01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:20.461
Five carbon atoms per molecule.
100% linear paraffins.

01:12:20.541 --> 01:12:23.483
No fluid catalytic cracking required.

01:12:25.178 --> 01:12:27.716
Sure, all that's Swahili to you...

01:12:27.796 --> 01:12:32.032
...but in laymen's terms it means that I'm
sitting on the lightest grade of crude oil...

01:12:32.112 --> 01:12:33.828
...the world has ever seen.

01:12:34.588 --> 01:12:36.602
Black magic.

01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:39.966
It is perfect.

01:12:40.046 --> 01:12:43.195
And with no sign of peak oil
for years to come...

01:12:44.365 --> 01:12:46.487
...I'm sitting on the jackpot.

01:12:46.567 --> 01:12:49.057
Does this look like the jackpot to you?

01:12:50.037 --> 01:12:53.846
Unfortunate, but necessary casualties.

01:12:55.909 --> 01:12:58.199
We're still trying to work it out.

01:12:59.129 --> 01:13:00.714
You knew.

01:13:09.689 --> 01:13:11.504
It's time.

01:13:12.025 --> 01:13:14.198
- What?
- It's time, it's time.

01:13:14.278 --> 01:13:18.140
No, no, no, no, look. Blue Jean's
gonna be back in just a second.

01:13:18.833 --> 01:13:22.290
Okay, okay, okay, okay. We need water.
We need water and blankets.

01:13:22.410 --> 01:13:26.340
- There's no fucking water, Logan.
- Right, right, right, okay, okay.

01:13:28.791 --> 01:13:31.305
- It's coming.
- Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

01:13:31.385 --> 01:13:33.594
Just once in your goddamn life help me.

01:13:33.674 --> 01:13:36.048
Okay, okay.

01:13:39.019 --> 01:13:42.266
- What, what?
- Your hands are fucking freezing.

01:13:42.346 --> 01:13:44.374
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:13:46.359 --> 01:13:49.041
- Get back in there!
- Okay. Okay.

01:14:01.678 --> 01:14:04.365
The first extraction didn't go so well.

01:14:04.745 --> 01:14:08.719
There were some unusual
chemical compounds in the mix.

01:14:10.183 --> 01:14:14.067
- Let's call it a work in progress.
- A work in progress?

01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:20.573
Your black magic is killing everyone.

01:14:21.527 --> 01:14:24.819
- You have to shut it down.
- Shut it down?

01:14:25.279 --> 01:14:27.254
That is not an option.

01:14:27.334 --> 01:14:32.218
My black magic is one of mother
Earth's finest resources...

01:14:32.905 --> 01:14:35.496
...although it is a bit of a two edged sword.

01:14:35.576 --> 01:14:38.332
It's also her latest biological weapon.

01:14:38.512 --> 01:14:40.995
And she's unleashed plenty over the years.

01:14:41.075 --> 01:14:44.618
Influenza, Ebola, AIDs.

01:14:44.698 --> 01:14:49.510
All in an attempt to get rid
of her worst viral infection.

01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:52.037
Mankind.

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:56.317
And she has caused some damage, to be sure.

01:14:56.697 --> 01:14:59.521
But we do manage to survive, don't we?

01:15:00.401 --> 01:15:02.790
And that's really what it's all about...

01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:05.118
...survival of the fittest.

01:15:05.672 --> 01:15:08.216
Even the likes of you

01:15:08.296 --> 01:15:10.333
...can understand that.

01:15:10.777 --> 01:15:12.099
Right?

01:15:12.179 --> 01:15:13.286
BJ?

01:15:19.319 --> 01:15:21.572
You have a little something right here.

01:15:26.442 --> 01:15:28.848
Another unfortunate casualty?

01:15:52.119 --> 01:15:54.366
Don't call me BJ.

01:16:15.842 --> 01:16:17.523
Suck oil.

01:16:22.549 --> 01:16:24.597
Son of a bitch.

01:16:59.886 --> 01:17:01.767
It's a girl.

01:17:02.055 --> 01:17:03.903
A girl!

01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:23.298
No!

01:19:52.158 --> 01:19:54.270
Alright, fuckwad, let's do this.

01:19:59.432 --> 01:20:02.118
What the fuck are you doing, Jean?

01:20:12.929 --> 01:20:15.826
BJ.

01:20:19.652 --> 01:20:22.500
BJ.

01:20:25.958 --> 01:20:28.159
BJ, BJ, BJ.

01:20:31.497 --> 01:20:33.912
BJ, BJ, BJ.

01:20:37.637 --> 01:20:40.085
BJ, BJ, BJ.

01:20:44.473 --> 01:20:46.758
BJ, BJ, BJ.

01:20:48.881 --> 01:20:51.271
- Don't...
- BJ, BJ, BJ.

01:20:51.351 --> 01:20:54.180
- ...call...
- BJ, BJ, BJ.

01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:55.322
...me...

01:20:55.402 --> 01:20:57.869
BJ, BJ, BJ, BJ!

01:20:57.957 --> 01:20:59.605
...BJ!

01:21:39.565 --> 01:21:42.014
Why don't you just fucking...

01:21:47.223 --> 01:21:49.241
Looks like I just struck oil.

01:21:55.181 --> 01:21:57.029
Piss off.

01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:33.298
Carla?

01:22:38.958 --> 01:22:40.006
Remy?

01:22:55.374 --> 01:22:56.922
Fuck!

01:23:08.088 --> 01:23:10.170
You think your bike still works?

01:23:12.691 --> 01:23:14.798
She's seen worse.

01:23:14.878 --> 01:23:17.344
Good, because we're gonna need it.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:23.483
Know what else they say doesn't mix with oil?

01:24:24.396 --> 01:24:27.615
I've been meaning to ask you,
where'd you get the name for the bar?

01:24:34.807 --> 01:24:37.958
We'll save that story for a rainy day.

01:26:28.454 --> 01:26:30.291
- Hey, Officers.
- Hey, Blue.

01:26:30.371 --> 01:26:34.414
- We're out celebrating this fucker tonight.
- Oh, yeah, what are you celebrating?

01:26:34.494 --> 01:26:36.908
Carter here finally got laid.

01:26:38.598 --> 01:26:40.871
Looks like he's been celebrating
since last Tuesday.

01:26:40.951 --> 01:26:45.606
This is nothing, Blue. He'll be drinking
for all of us 'til next payday.

01:26:46.170 --> 01:26:47.598
He's untouchable.

01:26:47.678 --> 01:26:50.832
- He'll be the last man standing tonight.
- You haven't seen anything like this guy.

01:26:50.912 --> 01:26:53.357
We've tried everything
to get this fucker to pass out.

01:26:53.437 --> 01:26:55.722
I bet I can make him pass out.

01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:58.891
I bet you a hundred dollars you can't.

01:26:59.986 --> 01:27:01.908
I'll give you 'til midnight.

01:27:01.988 --> 01:27:04.903
If you don't pass out by then,
I'll give you everything I make tonight.

01:27:07.710 --> 01:27:10.726
- You're on.
- But if I win...

01:27:11.264 --> 01:27:14.913
- ...I get your bike.
- What, his patrol bike?

01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:19.475
You're on.

01:27:20.706 --> 01:27:24.064
Are you crazy? Your patrol bike?
Think about this.

01:27:24.144 --> 01:27:26.232
I got it covered.

01:27:26.712 --> 01:27:28.140
You're insane.

01:27:29.848 --> 01:27:31.664
Good luck, Carter.

01:27:32.951 --> 01:27:36.576
Tequila. It's gonna be easier than I thought.

01:27:36.956 --> 01:27:40.513
<i>Alright, gentlemen, the moment
you've been holding on to your balls for.</i>

01:27:40.593 --> 01:27:44.050
<i>It's the lovely, the luscious,
the lusty, luminous...</i>

01:27:44.130 --> 01:27:46.011
<i>...Blue Jean.</i>

01:29:37.627 --> 01:29:41.567
Titty balls, titty balls, titty balls.

01:29:41.647 --> 01:29:46.031
Titty balls, titty balls,
titty balls, titty balls...

01:31:13.205 --> 01:31:15.737
Carter, Carter, Carter.

01:31:16.542 --> 01:31:19.675
Would you look at that?
Carter's passed out.

01:31:23.815 --> 01:31:25.918
You should see my knuckle ball.
