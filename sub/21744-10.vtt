to keep women contained.

every put-down, every slap

05:29.371 --> 05:33.625
and pass-over at work,
the anger compounds.

so does the rage.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.104
The patriarchy has dammed it up
for millennia,

05:54.354 --> 05:58.192
and Donald J. Trump
is the first world leader

05:58.358 --> 06:01.486
to start hammering away at that dam.

06:01.653 --> 06:04.448

need to take your own hammer to that dam?

07:01.046 --> 07:05.592
to release the feminine rage
and to use all your skills

and passion and vision
to break that dam to pieces.

24:51.450 --> 24:53.327
Sweet Gary.

24:54.578 --> 24:58.916
It's not what you've done,
it's what you're about to do.

24:59.374 --> 25:02.669
W... What about
the Night of a Thousand Tates?

25:02.836 --> 25:05.088
I'm really looking forward to that.

25:05.964 --> 25:07.341
That's still happening.

25:08.133 --> 25:10.385
Just not with you.

25:10.886 --> 25:15.140
What I need you for
is more important, more vital.

25:16.099 --> 25:18.227
But...

25:20.354 --> 25:22.523
I don't want to leave you, Kai.

25:24.316 --> 25:27.236
In doing this,
you will never leave me.

25:28.987 --> 25:31.240
You will become a part of me.

25:32.699 --> 25:36.203
Closer to me than any
of my other children.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.081
Yeah.

26:11.905 --> 26:14.199

26:47.482 --> 26:50.402

<i>Thank you, Beverly.</i>

27:08.837 --> 27:12.549

27:12.716 --> 27:14.593
<i>He is...</i>

27:16.720 --> 27:19.097

27:19.264 --> 27:22.142
I can't imagine the depths of sorrow

27:22.309 --> 27:24.603
you must feel right now.

27:26.522 --> 27:28.273
Incredible sorrow.

27:28.440 --> 27:30.817
Gary was a kind, gentle man.

27:30.984 --> 27:33.320
A big teddy bear.

27:33.487 --> 27:36.198
I pray that Senator Herbert Jackson
and the left-wing terrorists he supports

27:36.365 --> 27:37.533
are brought to justice.

27:37.699 --> 27:41.703
Are you suggesting a sitting senator
is guilty of murder?

27:41.912 --> 27:46.333
He emboldened the violent fascists
known as the Woke Warriors.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.418
These anti-life zealots...

27:50.546 --> 27:53.423
killed my friend
because he had the radical belief

27:53.590 --> 27:55.968
that babies are people.

27:56.093 --> 27:58.971

CAMERAMAN: <i>And we're clear.</i>

28:19.241 --> 28:21.034
What the hell, Beverly?

28:21.201 --> 28:22.661
You can't report on
a politically motivated murder

28:22.828 --> 28:23.912
like you're reading
a goddamn weather report.

28:24.079 --> 28:27.583
If we don't sell this,
our entire movement could be derailed.

28:29.501 --> 28:31.170
Am I clear?

28:31.336 --> 28:33.881
Perfectly clear, Divine Ruler.

28:41.930 --> 28:44.641
(MOUTHING WORDS INAUDIBLY)

28:44.808 --> 28:48.312
It's chamomile.
It'll relax you.

28:48.478 --> 28:50.647
Why are you being nice to me?

28:50.814 --> 28:52.733
I'm worried about you, Beverly.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.651
You haven't been the same since...

28:54.735 --> 28:55.736
Since I was forced at gunpoint

28:55.903 --> 28:57.571
to drink fake poisoned Kool-Aid?

28:57.738 --> 29:01.742
Or since I was thrown in an isolation cell
for a murder I didn't commit?

29:07.748 --> 29:09.291
I'm sorry I framed you.

29:09.458 --> 29:11.710
It was my only play at the time.

29:11.919 --> 29:13.545
But I feel terrible about it.

29:13.712 --> 29:16.006
Looking at you now,
broken like this.

29:16.173 --> 29:18.759
This isn't Beverly Hope.

29:19.551 --> 29:21.053
You need to escape.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.888
Get as far away from this place
as you can.

29:23.096 --> 29:24.681
I'm going to help you.

29:25.682 --> 29:29.102
-What is this?
-An Amtrak ticket to Butte, Montana.

29:29.269 --> 29:30.562
No one will find you there.

29:32.231 --> 29:35.776
-You're testing me.
-Please go away.

29:35.943 --> 29:37.736
I can't go back in that hole again.

29:37.903 --> 29:40.781
No, Beverly. I swear this is real.

29:43.867 --> 29:45.577
I want to make things right.

29:45.744 --> 29:48.163
The train leaves tomorrow
at 6:00 a.m.

29:48.330 --> 29:51.750
Leave. Start over.

29:54.378 --> 29:56.088
What about you?

29:59.216 --> 30:01.218
I'm gonna stay here and distract
Kai from your disappearance

30:01.385 --> 30:02.761
as long as I can.

30:03.887 --> 30:05.389
Please, Beverly.

30:14.147 --> 30:19.403
Tell Divine Ruler
I would never run. Ever.

30:19.570 --> 30:24.157
I am his loyal follower
until the end.

30:38.964 --> 30:40.799
We need to talk.

30:41.175 --> 30:42.301
Do you hear that?
That low buzz?

30:44.136 --> 30:46.096
I'm sorry, but I... I don't.

30:46.263 --> 30:48.265
Listen, it's here. It's here.
It's definitely here.

30:48.432 --> 30:49.725
I'm gonna find it.

30:49.850 --> 30:51.852
Hey, will you listen to me
for a second?

30:52.769 --> 30:56.064
After everything that's happened,
I cannot be paired with Winter.

30:56.231 --> 30:58.734
-It's just, it's not possible.
-Shh!

30:58.942 --> 31:01.111
How can you not hear that?
You don't hear that?

31:01.278 --> 31:04.031
-How can you not hear that?
-What are you doing?

31:04.198 --> 31:05.616
I told you, it's the buzz.
They planted something.

31:05.824 --> 31:08.952
-Who planted something?
-The Feds... Someone's listening.

31:09.119 --> 31:11.038
We have a mole, okay?
A double agent. I know.

31:11.205 --> 31:13.665
It's bugged,
this whole fucking place is.

31:13.790 --> 31:17.044
Kai, will you listen to me?
Would you please calm down

31:17.127 --> 31:19.171
-and let me help you?
-You don't even hear it!

31:19.338 --> 31:21.006
The buzz! It's getting louder!

31:21.215 --> 31:24.134
-I can't think in here.

31:41.985 --> 31:43.570
(QUIETLY) Ah, fuck.

31:46.448 --> 31:48.492
It's the little things.
The tiny details.

31:48.575 --> 31:50.494
That's what they're looking for,
that's the thing that's gonna trip me up.

31:50.744 --> 31:52.204
What's it gonna be?
What's it gonna be?

31:52.371 --> 31:54.373
What's it gonna be,
what's gonna get me?

31:56.750 --> 31:58.377
-Always five steps ahead, right, Kai?
-Jesus!

31:58.544 --> 32:02.422
-Vincent!
-Now...

32:02.589 --> 32:04.550
how can I turn that frown
upside down?

32:04.758 --> 32:06.718
You seem troubled.

32:06.885 --> 32:09.680
Uh, well, you already said it.
Th... They're after me.

32:09.847 --> 32:11.431
-Who?
-The Feds, everyone!

32:11.598 --> 32:13.100
I... I don't know.
I think there's a mole.

32:13.267 --> 32:14.601
There's definitely a bug
somewhere in this house.

32:14.768 --> 32:16.311
I just don't know where it is.

32:16.478 --> 32:19.314
But this is the only room
where I know I can be safe.

32:19.481 --> 32:23.193
This one room, where you are.

32:28.323 --> 32:30.033
I probably shouldn't have killed you.

32:30.200 --> 32:34.079
I've killed so many people now, it's gonna
be so hard to keep all these secrets.

32:35.122 --> 32:39.168
Well, if anybody can do it, Kai,
it's you.

32:39.334 --> 32:42.671
You are the master at keeping
all of the balls up in the air.

32:42.880 --> 32:46.091
Ah! Vincent!

32:49.761 --> 32:51.388
Don't listen to him, man.

32:51.555 --> 32:54.099
If you're gonna hallucinate
somebody, it should be me.

32:57.352 --> 32:59.771
Are you the ghost of Charles Manson?

32:59.938 --> 33:03.317
I'm not a ghost, man.
I'm still alive.

33:03.483 --> 33:05.819
Kicking it at Corcoran State Prison
in California.

33:05.986 --> 33:08.739
You should come visit sometime.

33:12.951 --> 33:14.828
I know why you're here.

33:15.746 --> 33:18.498
You're the only one who could
see things on my level.

33:23.295 --> 33:25.088
Well, you're never wrong
when you're right.

33:26.006 --> 33:27.549
What would you do,
if you were me?

33:27.716 --> 33:30.761
Identify the Judas.

33:30.928 --> 33:34.056
That's how I fucked up.

33:34.223 --> 33:36.433
I trusted too much.

33:42.356 --> 33:43.941
My Judas was Linda.

33:44.107 --> 33:46.235
He said we were going out
again tonight.

33:46.401 --> 33:49.279
Last night was too messy,
and he was going to show us how to do it.

33:49.446 --> 33:51.406
I didn't want to go,
but Charlie asked me,

33:51.573 --> 33:54.117
and I was afraid to say no.

33:54.326 --> 33:57.246
He said, "As soon as you enter the room,
as soon as you see the man,

33:57.412 --> 33:59.873
"slit his throat right away."

34:00.040 --> 34:02.626
He said to leave a sign.

34:02.793 --> 34:04.962
"You girls know what I mean.

34:05.128 --> 34:07.172
"Something witchy."

34:07.339 --> 34:09.883
MANSON: It's always the bitches, man.

34:10.968 --> 34:12.678
Can't trust the bitches.

34:13.387 --> 34:15.097
I can't trust anyone.

34:15.264 --> 34:18.559
Look, as long as there's hate
in your heart,

34:18.725 --> 34:20.519
there'll be hate in the world.

Bitches.

34:40.831 --> 34:42.583

-Stay here.

-Don't you move!

34:58.056 --> 34:59.892
Whoa.

35:04.021 --> 35:06.273
Thorough. Oh, fuck!

35:06.440 --> 35:09.985
Valerie always said the male
was a biological accident,

35:10.152 --> 35:11.904
a walking abortion.

35:12.070 --> 35:15.115
Oh, God, if only you'd been
aborted in your mother's belly,

35:15.282 --> 35:18.410
how much disappointment would
the rest of us have been spared?

35:19.411 --> 35:21.079
You can't talk to me like that anymore.

35:21.246 --> 35:25.501
I could not have been more clear if I had
tattooed it on the inside of your eyelids.

35:25.667 --> 35:27.669
It wasn't complicated.
Two steps.

35:27.836 --> 35:30.839
"A" to "B."
Unleash female rage.

35:31.006 --> 35:36.094
Incite the American woman's desperate
and patriarchally contained violent anger.

35:36.303 --> 35:39.848
Give her no choice but to lash out
and cut up every man they see.

35:39.973 --> 35:42.100
I did that!
I got maced, for fuck's sake!

35:42.267 --> 35:43.685
Look at the chaos out there!

35:43.852 --> 35:45.354
You've enraged everyone.

35:45.521 --> 35:47.856
And what of the poor females
closest to you?

35:48.023 --> 35:50.067
Your sister's defeated,
another one is dead.

35:50.234 --> 35:53.278
You even broke unbreakable tiger
Beverly Hope!

35:53.487 --> 35:56.114
It's not my fault they were weak.

35:56.323 --> 35:59.868
I am the final carrier
for Valerie Solanas' torch.1

36:00.035 --> 36:03.205
She handed the responsibility
for SCUM to me, personally,1

36:03.372 --> 36:06.750
her protégée, and look how you
have failed us both.

36:06.875 --> 36:08.877
MANSON: My goodness.

36:09.044 --> 36:11.505
I can't wait to see her face
when you tell her the truth.

36:16.218 --> 36:20.931
Did you think I was gonna drown myself
in female rage?

36:21.098 --> 36:24.309
That I would die a martyr
to some dead bitch's cause?

36:25.561 --> 36:27.396
-Fuck that.
-Fuck that!

36:27.563 --> 36:29.106
You gave me my purpose, Bebe.

36:29.273 --> 36:32.359
You awaken me to the power
of pissing people off.

36:32.442 --> 36:34.736
And hell yes, I want women mad.

36:34.903 --> 36:37.656
Popping off, losing their minds,
getting hysterical.

36:37.865 --> 36:39.324
But women can't run things.

36:39.491 --> 36:41.076
They're too emotional, irrational.

36:41.243 --> 36:42.452
I need women's rage to tear it all down,

36:42.661 --> 36:44.788
'cause then I'm gonna be the last
one standing to lead them.

36:44.955 --> 36:47.583
Amen! Helter Skelter!

36:47.749 --> 36:50.002
You fucking turd.

36:50.169 --> 36:52.671
A turd who knows the truth:

36:52.838 --> 36:56.091
that women need to be grabbed
by their pussies and led,

36:56.258 --> 36:59.219
preferably to the kitchen
to make me a sandwich.

39:02.551 --> 39:05.137
You cried and cried.

39:05.304 --> 39:08.140
I was afraid it was gonna hurt.

39:08.307 --> 39:10.475
So I grabbed a pair of scissors
off the sink

39:10.642 --> 39:14.479
at the hairdresser's
and cut my hair to show you it didn't.

-Mmm.

Because I know you, Winter.

39:25.199 --> 39:27.201
I've watched you
since they brought you home.

The way your eyes open real wide,
like a Disney chipmunk,

something to hide.

40:09.409 --> 40:11.286
I'm your big brother.

40:13.247 --> 40:16.166
They say that for a girl that
relationship is more important

40:16.333 --> 40:18.502
than the one with her father.

40:18.669 --> 40:21.421
You're very important to me, Kai.

40:21.588 --> 40:23.549
You've always looked after me.

40:25.384 --> 40:27.261
Then why do you want to hurt me?

40:32.057 --> 40:35.394
(WHISPERS) Why would you say that?

40:35.561 --> 40:37.729
All these people...

40:37.896 --> 40:39.606
Who are they?

40:39.773 --> 40:42.401
What do they want from you?

40:42.568 --> 40:44.695
What do you want from them?

40:45.779 --> 40:48.699
I look at you and I can't see you anymore.

40:48.866 --> 40:50.534
I can't feel you.

40:51.159 --> 40:53.787
One day, this is all going to end.

40:53.954 --> 40:55.998
They're all going to get
what they want from you

40:56.164 --> 40:57.624
and they'll leave.

40:58.876 --> 41:00.752
Is that what you want?

41:03.005 --> 41:05.257
You want them all to leave?

41:06.049 --> 41:09.553
You want to destroy
everything I've worked so hard to build?

41:09.720 --> 41:11.263
No.

41:11.430 --> 41:14.099
They worship you, and they should.

41:15.017 --> 41:17.895
But I want you to know
that when they're all gone,

41:18.103 --> 41:19.938
I'll still be here.

41:21.899 --> 41:24.193
We're all that's left of our family.

41:33.243 --> 41:35.537
So why do I feel you slipping away?

41:37.706 --> 41:39.583
Because I am.

41:43.420 --> 41:45.506
Because...

41:45.672 --> 41:47.508
the only way for me
to be there for you in the end

41:47.674 --> 41:49.259
is if I get away from you now.

41:54.139 --> 41:55.849
I love you.

41:56.016 --> 42:00.354
But when I look at you now,
all I feel is terror.

42:01.855 --> 42:04.816
I'm afraid that
if I'm around it much longer,

42:04.983 --> 42:08.320
I won't be able to feel anything
else about you ever again.

42:10.864 --> 42:12.366
What if I say no?

42:16.870 --> 42:20.749
If I say I need you
and that you leaving would be a betrayal?

42:23.544 --> 42:25.796
What if others want to leave with you?

42:25.963 --> 42:27.840
I'd convince them to stay.

42:29.842 --> 42:32.094
And I'd kill them
if they tried to follow me.

42:32.302 --> 42:35.138
(GASPS) Fuck!

42:57.703 --> 43:00.747
I always loved you the most, Winter.

43:01.498 --> 43:03.917
You were, still are,

43:05.419 --> 43:07.671
the only person in the world

43:07.838 --> 43:11.592
who really talks to me
and knows me.

43:32.112 --> 43:34.156
I don't want to lose you.

43:36.283 --> 43:37.951
I need you.

43:39.036 --> 43:42.581
So if you going away for a while
is the price I have to pay

43:42.748 --> 43:47.503
for having one person
in this shitbag world

43:47.669 --> 43:52.716
of liars and cheats and traitors...

43:55.344 --> 43:58.096
...then so be it.

43:58.263 --> 43:59.640
Really?

44:00.641 --> 44:03.227
I am this movement.

44:03.393 --> 44:05.687
And one day I'm gonna be
in the White House,

44:05.854 --> 44:08.273
on Air Force One,
giving speeches to Congress

44:08.440 --> 44:11.735
and fucking the wives
of other world leaders,

44:11.902 --> 44:13.695
and I'm gonna need
someone beside me

44:13.862 --> 44:15.739
I know I can trust.

44:16.949 --> 44:18.325
Thank you, Kai.

44:18.534 --> 44:20.244
Thank you so much.

44:22.371 --> 44:23.372
(SOBS QUIETLY)

44:33.757 --> 44:35.634

45:08.208 --> 45:10.002
Can you just tell me that?

45:12.963 --> 45:14.965
What did they offer you?

45:15.132 --> 45:18.177
Immunity? Witness protection program?

45:18.343 --> 45:19.845
Tell me it wasn't money.

45:20.012 --> 45:21.638
-Nobody offered me anything, Kai.
-Hmm.

45:21.805 --> 45:24.057
I'm not the mole.
I don't even think there is one.

45:25.100 --> 45:27.227
Only the mole would say that.

45:28.103 --> 45:29.771
You're not thinking clearly.

45:30.397 --> 45:33.400
You're just trying to find things
to fit in with your delusions.

She thinks you're delusional.

45:37.529 --> 45:39.823
-I know.
-You know?

45:47.497 --> 45:50.626
I loved you, Winter.

45:50.834 --> 45:55.297
How can you sit here
and lie to my face like this?

45:55.464 --> 45:57.341
I'm not lying, Kai.

45:59.593 --> 46:01.053
Pinky power.

46:01.220 --> 46:02.804
Then you'll know
I'm telling the truth.

46:02.971 --> 46:05.641
I'm not the mole.

46:10.646 --> 46:12.022
How do you explain this?

46:12.314 --> 46:15.567
What's that?

46:15.734 --> 46:17.861
You know what this is.

46:18.028 --> 46:21.823
This is a bug,
and you planted it.

46:21.990 --> 46:24.326
It's the battery to my Fitbit.

46:24.493 --> 46:26.662
Then why did I find it
sewn into Kai's cushions?

46:26.912 --> 46:28.872
-You found it?
-Yeah.

46:30.999 --> 46:32.376

46:34.878 --> 46:37.798

46:39.925 --> 46:42.803
This is bullshit.
I didn't put that there, she did.

46:42.970 --> 46:44.888
This is payback
for me screwing your wife.

46:45.472 --> 46:49.768
No, this is your disloyalty
coming back to bite you in the ass.

46:49.977 --> 46:53.355
You never believed
in Kai's vision of the world.

46:53.522 --> 46:56.108
You were a Hillary supporter,
for God's sake.

46:56.316 --> 46:59.903
You were just looking for
the opportunity to take us down.

47:00.070 --> 47:03.740
Well, I am glad I exposed you
for what you really are

47:03.907 --> 47:06.034
before you could destroy us.

-I didn't do anything.

-Confess!
-I can't!
