there's taxes,

16:46.880 --> 16:48.799
and old-ass warrants

-Fuck all that.
-Language. (CHUCKLES)

16:51.135 --> 16:53.554

your language around her.

Gotta tap that ass

17:29.173 --> 17:30.799
Have you ever tapped someone
under duress?

17:30.883 --> 17:33.427
Course I have. My uncle
passed away unexpectedly.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.804
So, I had to tap this cougar
at this mortuary.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.681
Got a half off that coffin.

With that stuff you said
about Little Women.

You're old and you're bald.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.130
I can schtup somebody

You'll call Deidre?

I'll go to her house.
