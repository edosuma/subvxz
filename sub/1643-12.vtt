MALE NARRATOR: Previously on
Prison Break:

00:03.086 --> 00:04.838
SUCRE: What you're doing up there
in the infirmary,

00:04.922 --> 00:06.632
what has that got to do
with what we're doing here?

00:06.715 --> 00:09.051
Four days from now
on the night of the escape,

00:09.134 --> 00:12.179
we'll have 18 minutes to get the bars off
the infirmary window

00:12.262 --> 00:15.098
and for all seven of us
to get across the wire and over the wall.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.184
- Is that doable?
- Of course.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.561
Maricruz? It's me.
Baby, what the hell is going on?

00:19.645 --> 00:22.814
Yeah, well, Hector says
that you could serve your full sentence.

00:22.898 --> 00:24.525
What are you doing here?
Where's Maricruz?

00:24.608 --> 00:26.944
She's not gonna be
coming around here anymore.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.321
- This is a joke, right?
- She's with me now.

00:29.696 --> 00:33.408
I just need to know what Michael Scofield
wanted from you

00:33.492 --> 00:35.452
in exchange for the green card.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.996
NIKA: Why would you need
a credit card in prison?

00:38.622 --> 00:39.623

00:39.790 --> 00:40.791
If I'd have known

00:40.874 --> 00:42.501
that this is how this whole thing
was gonna turn out

00:42.584 --> 00:44.294
I'd have gotten some crap job
with the Feds.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.005
Keep talking like that, I'm gonna be forced
to put a bullet in your head.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.800
I need to get out while I still got my life.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.218
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

00:51.301 --> 00:53.512
Things have changed. I want in.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.558
- What's up?
- We've got too many people.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.519
I've done the math.
And one of them has to go.

01:02.646 --> 01:06.108
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Oh, it's not a problem.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.234
Hmm.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.152
Impressive résumé.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.363
Thank you.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.491
Tell me why you chose to pursue a career
in engineering.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.909
Well,

01:16.577 --> 01:19.580
I've always been interested in structure.

01:20.289 --> 01:21.540
Geometry.

01:22.666 --> 01:25.460
How things fit together.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.755
How an object that performs a function

01:28.839 --> 01:31.758
can also be a work of art.

01:32.509 --> 01:36.430
What about the future?
Where do you see yourself in five years?

01:50.027 --> 01:51.612

03:39.761 --> 03:40.887

03:42.055 --> 03:45.183
Oh, he's gonna raise hell
the next few years.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.811
Take after his momma.

03:50.147 --> 03:53.483
Yeah, you know. Same old same up here.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.654
But,

03:59.698 --> 04:02.033
things are getting pretty tense.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.412
Like they're fixing to...collide.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.164
Know what I mean, Jimmy?

04:07.831 --> 04:11.251
There's a potential...situation.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.963
SCOFIELD: I found our access
to the infirmary building,

04:15.046 --> 04:16.923
but I'm going to need some time
to make it work.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.426
- How much time?
- Enough for me to find my way up

04:19.509 --> 04:22.804
a 20 foot vertical drainpipe
without using a ladder.

04:23.346 --> 04:27.350
I'll probably need to skip Pl tomorrow
if I want to get this thing done.

04:27.434 --> 04:30.187
You can't just skip it. It ain't class.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.564
What if one of the bulls
decided to drop in?

04:32.647 --> 04:34.733
Well, I don't have a choice, do I?

04:34.816 --> 04:36.985
Once we get through the pipe
below the guard's room,

04:37.068 --> 04:40.947
it'll be a whole lot easier.
I can come and go without using the door.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.699
And with Westmoreland as a look-out,

04:42.783 --> 04:44.826
we'll have one more man available
for digging.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.536
Westmoreland's gonna be a problem.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.039
All seven of us can't break over that wall
in 18 minutes.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.458
You said it yourself. It's impossible.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.544
Listen, man, I'm telling you,
one of us has gotta take a hike.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.837
SCOFIELDI I know.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.591
Mind if I share that
with the rest of the class?

05:01.092 --> 05:04.387
C-NOTE: Apparently,
college boy here did the math.

05:05.263 --> 05:08.558
Figured out that we got
too many clowns in the car.

05:08.725 --> 05:12.604
So one of us is in here digging,
but his seat ain't guaranteed.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.899
- How's this your problem, man?
- He doesn't know what he's talking about.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.151
I'm not gonna dig if I'm not gonna go.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.278
We need to make a decision
on who gets cut.

05:20.362 --> 05:23.573
Well, I think we all can agree
who that should be, right?

05:28.078 --> 05:30.205
Pardon me for interrupting.

05:30.789 --> 05:31.915
But,

05:34.251 --> 05:35.961
what's that smell?

05:38.421 --> 05:39.422
(SNIFFS)

05:39.506 --> 05:42.300
It smells a little like conspiracy.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.928
- We need to get back to work.
- Yeah, before you do,

05:45.011 --> 05:46.388
I have an announcement to make.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.139
I've been growing leery
the way you all talk,

05:48.223 --> 05:50.141
like I'm a lesser man.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.727
So I bought an insurance policy.

05:53.103 --> 05:57.107
I called up my guy on the outside
and I told him about our plan.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.652
And I told him in all likelihood
I'll be seeing him next week.

06:00.735 --> 06:01.820
But,

06:02.946 --> 06:05.782
if he don't hear from me
five minutes before the escape

06:05.866 --> 06:08.410
and 20 minutes after,
I told him to call up the Warden,

06:08.493 --> 06:10.996
blow the whistle on the whole thing.

06:12.122 --> 06:15.208
So if you all got ideas
about getting rid of me,

06:17.085 --> 06:19.754
I suggest you make other plans.

07:00.086 --> 07:03.214
Son of a bitch has got a countermove
for everything.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.799
Not for this.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.970

07:09.304 --> 07:10.680

07:12.891 --> 07:15.352
Look who you're walking with right now.

07:15.435 --> 07:19.147
You should be up there calling the shots
with the rest of the suits.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.482
Yeah. So?

07:21.024 --> 07:22.025
So?

07:22.817 --> 07:26.363
Scofield is only here for one reason.
His brother.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.366
And he only needs two things.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.619
The old man's money
and the mob boss' plane.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.038
He don't need you.

07:35.497 --> 07:39.000
You just happened to be in the same cell
when he got here.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.962
- You and the toilet.
- I've done a lot of work on this thing.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.214
Exactly. And me, too.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.133
Yeah, we're just the damn laborers
on this thing, man.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.135
And the night
that Fish goes into that hole,

07:49.219 --> 07:52.013
you think he wants to carry
all that extra baggage?

07:52.097 --> 07:54.057
'Cause that's all we are.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.226
I don't know about you, but I'm going.

07:59.938 --> 08:02.857
How much does he tell you, anyways,

08:03.233 --> 08:05.694
or does he keep it all to himself?

08:06.778 --> 08:10.657
Yeah, he probably tells you,
"The less you know, the better," right?

08:10.740 --> 08:13.910
You don't know what you're talking about.
He tells me everything.

08:13.994 --> 08:17.998
If he tells you everything,
then you don't need him.

08:19.416 --> 08:22.752
Now, we can go ourselves. Me and you.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.757
Or, you know,
you can wait and see if Scofield

08:27.841 --> 08:30.385
really wants to carry heavy weight.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.429

08:48.987 --> 08:51.281
- That's not gonna happen.
- You promised.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.951
I said I'd think about it.
Maybe somewhere down the road.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.954

- He was in the garage underneath his car.
- He's in surgery right now.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.612

has caused his muscle tissue

and with a bullet, there's always
an increased risk of infection,

14:30.661 --> 14:32.455

15:36.602 --> 15:38.312
<i>One thing led to another.</i>

15:38.396 --> 15:40.857
- What, he's dead?
- Yeah.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.692
And, unfortunately,

15:44.610 --> 15:46.279
there was a kid there.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.822
Yeah. What...

15:48.281 --> 15:50.199
What are you talking about?
You killed the kid?

15:50.283 --> 15:52.034
<i>It was unintentional.</i>

15:52.785 --> 15:55.371
<i>- It's</i> a <i>kid, man.
- I know. I'm sorry.</i>

15:56.122 --> 15:58.332
The SOB used him as a shield.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.669
A boy or a girl?

16:01.752 --> 16:04.213
- I don't know. Boy.
- How <i>old?</i>

16:04.714 --> 16:06.340
Four, maybe five.

16:17.059 --> 16:20.229
- Who's here to see me?
- Hell if I know. Some lady.

16:23.774 --> 16:24.901
Baby.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.363
Hi.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.074
You look so beautiful.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.372
I came here
'cause I have to tell you something.

16:38.748 --> 16:39.874
What?

16:41.083 --> 16:43.002
I'm pregnant, Fernando.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.591
Pregnant?

16:50.343 --> 16:51.928
With your baby.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.265
I'm gonna have your son.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.603
You... You're gonna...

17:01.562 --> 17:03.940
We? We're gonna have a baby?

17:05.107 --> 17:07.734
Oye, <i>papi,</i> you hear that?
I'm gonna be a dad.

17:07.818 --> 17:10.404
- I'm not finished.
- What, <i>mami,</i> what?

17:10.613 --> 17:12.114
Okay. Hector,

17:12.323 --> 17:14.325
-he asked me to marry him.
- What?

17:14.407 --> 17:17.411
- Look, it's crazy, I know.
- Well, tell him no.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.622
Tell him you're having my son.
We're going to be a family.

17:19.704 --> 17:20.957
Fernando.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.416
Look, my mom, she says

17:23.960 --> 17:27.588
that having a baby is the hardest job
in the whole world.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.758
And it's even harder if I do this by myself.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.137
And all I know is I'm really scared.

17:35.930 --> 17:39.433
- I'm really scared to do this alone.
- You're not gonna have to.

17:39.517 --> 17:42.478
- Well, I haven't told him no yet.
- Babe, wait.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.691
- You're not actually considering this?
- Oh, baby.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.819
I don't know, I don't know.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.572
My God, baby, you gotta stop listening
to these people.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.699
They're poisoning your brain.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.450
Your hormone things,
they're out of whack.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.744
You're not thinking straight.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.914
This is our child we're talking about.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.668
I want you to listen to me.

18:06.377 --> 18:10.715
I want you to wait.
I'm gonna be out sooner than you think.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.343
You keep on telling me that.

18:16.220 --> 18:19.932
C.O. PATTERSON: All right.
Visiting time is up. Let's go.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.773
Tell me you're gonna wait.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.568
Hands off, Sucre.

18:33.863 --> 18:37.033
You're all I got left in the world, baby.
Please.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.203
I love you.

18:42.788 --> 18:45.291
But you'll learn to love again, right?

18:48.544 --> 18:51.297
Tell me you're gonna tell him no, honey.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.883
I don't know.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.429
I don't know anything anymore.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.228
Sucre, come on.

19:24.038 --> 19:26.415
- The kid's here.
- KELLERMAN: <i>Perfect.</i>

19:26.957 --> 19:29.877
<i>Follow him back to the lawyers.
Call me back.</i>

19:29.960 --> 19:30.920
(BEEPS)

20:24.306 --> 20:27.560
- Where you going?
<i>- I'll</i> be back in 10 minutes.

20:27.810 --> 20:31.647
- What do you have to do?
- It's complicated. I can't explain.

20:33.107 --> 20:36.110
But if it works, you'll see soon enough.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.780
I want to go with you. I want to see now.

20:39.864 --> 20:42.116
Someone has to stay here.

20:42.199 --> 20:45.327
- I need a look-out.
- I'm always on look-out.

20:45.870 --> 20:49.123
You're my cellmate.
Who else is gonna do it?

20:54.837 --> 20:57.298
I'll be back in 10 minutes, okay?

20:58.841 --> 20:59.967
Okay.

21:28.537 --> 21:32.041
We're all lined up for tomorrow.
Where do you want him?

21:35.044 --> 21:36.170
John.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.007
Tomorrow, where do you want T-Bag?
In the shop or in the shed?

21:40.090 --> 21:41.050
(SHUSHING)

21:41.467 --> 21:44.136
I don't care. You decide.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.004
Thank God.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.381
Are you okay?

23:45.132 --> 23:46.717
Yeah, I'm okay.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.346
She didn't do anything.

23:51.472 --> 23:54.183
- She didn't deserve this.
- I know.

24:04.234 --> 24:05.778
C.O.: All right,
let's go, inmates.

24:10.324 --> 24:11.700
- Here you go, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.702
These were seriously hard to get.

24:13.786 --> 24:17.247
- What you need them for anyway?
- None of your business.

24:24.296 --> 24:28.926
Thank you for waiting, Theodore.
I don't mean to deny your time in the yard.

24:30.219 --> 24:32.054
What's this all about?

24:32.680 --> 24:33.722
L.-

24:34.598 --> 24:37.226
I'm afraid I have some terrible news.

24:38.727 --> 24:42.940
Your cousin James was shot and killed
in his home yesterday.

24:43.023 --> 24:45.734
His son James Junior was killed as well.

24:47.861 --> 24:49.279
(WHIMPERING)

24:50.990 --> 24:52.825
I'm very, very 80W-

25:01.458 --> 25:03.168
What does it mean?

25:04.461 --> 25:06.046
Am I chosen,

25:07.589 --> 25:08.882
or what?

25:10.009 --> 25:11.093
Often the Lord appears

25:11.176 --> 25:14.179
when you're in particular need
of forgiveness.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.641
Maybe that's what's happening right now.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.276
John, it's never too late.

25:27.818 --> 25:31.947
If you agree to accept Christ
into your heart and turn from your sin,

25:32.031 --> 25:35.200
he will forgive you
and save you in eternity.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.622
Do you agree?

25:45.627 --> 25:50.132
Revelation: Chapter 3, Verse 20.

25:51.383 --> 25:55.721
"Jesus said,
'Behold, I stand at the door, and knock.

25:55.804 --> 25:59.183
"'If any man hear my voice,
and open the door,

26:00.225 --> 26:02.269
"'l will come in 110 him.“

26:20.746 --> 26:24.583
He got to the infirmary building last night
through the old sewer pipe.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.836
It's the same pipe
that runs under the guard's room.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.588
That's all I know.

GEARY: That's the little thumbsucker
that swiped my watch.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.847
- BELLICK: Who, Tweener?
- Solid gold.

26:39.098 --> 26:42.101
He took it right off my arm.
It was a half hour before I even noticed it.

26:42.184 --> 26:43.852
Whose was it in the first place?

26:43.936 --> 26:46.522
I don't care that you stole it.
You can tell me.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.273
Michael Scofield.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.877
What are you looking at?

27:10.045 --> 27:12.381
I'll be right around the corner.

27:27.271 --> 27:28.730
(GRUNTING)

28:26.788 --> 28:28.290
C.O. PATTERSON: Westmoreland.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.792
You scared me, boss.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.552
Get back to work.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.359
(BLOWING WHISTLE)

(WATCH BEEPING)

29:12.668 --> 29:14.044
Move it, Scofield.

and the Lord shall save me..."

29:31.853 --> 29:34.856
"...and cry aloud:
and he shall hear my voice."

SCOFIELD: What are you doing?

30:24.614 --> 30:25.866
Nothing.

30:28.994 --> 30:32.414
Well, keep an eye on the tier for me,
will you?

30:33.540 --> 30:37.044
When are we getting out of here exactly?
I need to know the time.

30:37.127 --> 30:39.880
- As soon as possible...
- As soon as possible is not a specific time.

30:39.963 --> 30:42.257
- You tell Abruzzi the time?
- Yes, because he needs to know.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.218
- Why does he need to know and I don't?
- Because he's arranging the plane.

30:45.302 --> 30:47.304
Why the sudden curiosity?

30:51.516 --> 30:55.896
Why would you want to be responsible
for potentially dangerous information?

30:55.979 --> 30:57.981
The less you know, the better.

30:58.065 --> 30:59.983
It's for your own good.

31:04.404 --> 31:05.906
I have to go.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.784
I'll meet you in Pl.

31:19.086 --> 31:20.962
Stealing from a guard?

31:21.129 --> 31:25.050
You can get thrown in the SHU for that.
Maybe even add a few years to your bid.

31:25.133 --> 31:29.429
- I don't know what you're talking about...
- Don't deny it. I already know it's true.

31:29.513 --> 31:32.349
Lucky for you, I got some pull around here.

31:32.432 --> 31:36.561
I can make this sort of thing go away,
like it never even happened.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.232
Mmm.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.485
That's good.

31:44.736 --> 31:45.821
Now,

31:49.658 --> 31:53.078
I'm sure you've heard the word "rat."
I don't like it.

31:53.703 --> 31:55.330
"Snitch" neither.

31:55.831 --> 31:59.584
Those sort of words aren't appropriate
for what I need from you.

31:59.668 --> 32:02.087
What I need is a little information.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.673
Like when you're hanging out
with Scofield.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.760
Just come back and tell me what he said.

32:15.684 --> 32:17.561
I got an extra burger.

32:21.523 --> 32:23.275
But, man, I'm full.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.361
What do you say, kiddo?

32:26.903 --> 32:28.697
Want a cheeseburger,

32:28.864 --> 32:31.074
or you want to go to the SHU?

32:39.332 --> 32:40.876
That's my boy.

32:43.545 --> 32:47.090
Hey, honey. What are you doing here?
I thought you left.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.426
What's wrong?

32:49.634 --> 32:52.220
I... I've been thinking.

32:53.597 --> 32:55.974
I think we need to make a change.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.476
What are you talking about?

32:57.559 --> 33:00.729
Remember when we first got married
and we thought about moving out west?

33:00.812 --> 33:02.397
Yeah, we were 22.

33:02.981 --> 33:06.318
Well, maybe, we should give it a shot.
It's not too late.

33:06.401 --> 33:09.196
I don't understand. What brought this on?

33:09.613 --> 33:11.198
It's just work.

33:12.032 --> 33:14.284
I'm tired of being on the road
and working for somebody else

33:14.367 --> 33:17.621
while you sit at home all alone
night after night.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.665
- I want our lives to be about us.
- I do, too,

33:20.749 --> 33:24.669
but there's so much to think about
with the kids and the house.

33:25.462 --> 33:26.922
We gotta go.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.967
You're in trouble, aren't you?

33:36.765 --> 33:37.766
Ho.

33:38.475 --> 33:41.603
- Crowd has thinned out in here.
- How you doing, Sucre?

33:41.686 --> 33:43.897
Almost there. Switch me out.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.941
You're up, then Westmoreland.

33:46.024 --> 33:49.903
We gotta get through.
Michael's gonna be coming back this way.

36:42.659 --> 36:44.786
SARA: Okay, you go ahead and
write that up.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.273
<i>- Hello.
- HALE: Veronica Donovan?</i>

37:13.898 --> 37:17.610
<i>- Who... Who is this?
- It... It doesn't matter who I am.</i>

37:18.319 --> 37:19.654
<i>Don't hang up.</i>

37:19.738 --> 37:22.907
I have information
that you may be interested in.

37:23.825 --> 37:27.078
Information that will lead
to the exoneration of Lincoln Burrows.

37:27.162 --> 37:30.165
- What? <i>What is it?
- I can't tell you that now.</i>

37:31.082 --> 37:35.128
Meet me tomorrow at the Highland Cafe,
on Kennedy Avenue.

37:35.670 --> 37:36.880
<i>This isn't a trap.</i>

37:36.963 --> 37:39.174
<i>I will...
I will tell you everything you need to know.</i>

37:39.632 --> 37:41.593
Highland Café, 8:00 p.m.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.188
Hey, that's enough.

37:54.647 --> 37:56.691
- Leave us alone.
- GOON: You sure?

37:56.983 --> 37:58.568
Get out of here.

38:08.578 --> 38:10.955
You don't have to do this.

38:11.748 --> 38:13.833
You don't have to do this.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.961
You don't have to do this.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.800
You brought it on yourself.

38:21.883 --> 38:26.179
I'm just an emissary for all the pain
and suffering you caused.

38:26.262 --> 38:29.182
All the families you ruined, all the kids.

38:29.265 --> 38:30.892
What about Jimmy?

38:32.060 --> 38:35.772
He had nothing to do with this.
You didn't need to kill him.

38:35.855 --> 38:38.233
And what about his beautiful son?

38:38.483 --> 38:42.862
His whole life in front of him.
You didn't need to kill a beautiful child.

38:45.448 --> 38:47.700
After all I've done,
maybe I do deserve to die.

38:47.784 --> 38:50.578
Maybe I do, but you are no better than me.

38:51.412 --> 38:54.290
But I can be, if I want.

38:54.707 --> 38:58.711
God has given me the chance to choose.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.047
What?

39:01.923 --> 39:05.677
And maybe I should give you
a chance as well.

39:07.136 --> 39:09.430
Anything, anything. Please.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.267
Please.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.185
Please.

39:15.270 --> 39:16.604
Back out.

39:22.485 --> 39:23.987
Of the escape?

39:24.654 --> 39:25.864
Or die.

39:27.991 --> 39:29.284
I would...

39:29.367 --> 39:30.368
(CHUCKUNG)

39:30.952 --> 39:33.496
I wouldn't make it out there anyway.

39:35.081 --> 39:37.083
Not with my proclivities.

39:37.834 --> 39:41.254
I want you...to give me your word.

39:42.797 --> 39:45.425
You hear me?
I want you to give me your word!

39:45.508 --> 39:47.719
