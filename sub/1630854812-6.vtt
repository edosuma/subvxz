I'm gonna do that.

- Who cares?

10:06.974 --> 10:08.006

36:51.043 --> 36:53.443
I'm honestly so proud of
us right now because we're

36:53.512 --> 36:55.078
acting so classy.

36:55.147 --> 36:57.514
- Is there any way I
could just get a red wine?

36:59.918 --> 37:01.318
- What is quail?

37:02.421 --> 37:03.420
- Yeah.

37:03.488 --> 37:04.988
- That might be
too fancy for us.

37:05.057 --> 37:06.189
- Quail?

37:06.258 --> 37:07.490
I've never even
been to a restaurant

37:07.559 --> 37:08.658
that had that on the menu.

37:08.727 --> 37:09.926
Just--just put it that way.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.361
- We definitely
don't want a quail.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.230
- Did you eat the quail?

37:13.298 --> 37:15.498
- We're fake fancy,
just so you know.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.101
Like, we've never really
messed with a quail.

37:18.170 --> 37:21.004
I'm sure this is exquisite
for the normal person.

37:21.073 --> 37:22.339
- [bleep] quail.

37:22.407 --> 37:23.873
Are you out of your bird?

37:23.942 --> 37:25.909
- Just not us.
We're not normal.

37:25.978 --> 37:27.244
- What's the first course?

37:29.448 --> 37:32.482
<i> [fancy music]</i>

37:32.551 --> 37:34.517
- I don't eat fish.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.586
What do you guys want?
Quail, octopus,

37:36.688 --> 37:39.556
or [bleep] sabretooth tiger?
[laughs]

37:39.658 --> 37:41.725
Duck breast.
- You have duck titties?

37:41.793 --> 37:43.927
- You wanna see it?
- Your booby?

37:43.996 --> 37:45.562
- You've seen it.
- I've seen them.

37:45.631 --> 37:47.497
- Do you think they
look like bologna tits?

37:47.566 --> 37:48.498
- No.

37:48.567 --> 37:49.733
- I'll do ghosties.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.034
- You would do a ghostie?

37:51.103 --> 37:52.168
- Yeah.

37:52.237 --> 37:54.971
- What the [bleep]
is happening?

37:55.040 --> 37:57.707
- Do you wanna tell Deena
what you saw in your room yet,

37:57.776 --> 37:58.942
or do you wanna wait?

38:00.112 --> 38:01.511
- I saw a spirit.

38:03.181 --> 38:05.949
- Here?
- In the room.

38:06.018 --> 38:08.285
- OK.
- It's fine.

38:08.353 --> 38:10.020
- Was she nice?
- Mm-hmm.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.421
- Spirits are not nice.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.757
- Was it a he or a she?
- It's fine. I'm in control.

38:13.825 --> 38:16.192
- You saw it?
- Yeah.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.438

38:28.507 --> 38:29.639

talking about him.

38:29.708 --> 38:30.974
- No, the spirit's fine.

38:31.043 --> 38:34.477

[bleep] talking about me."

38:34.546 --> 38:36.046
- OK.
<i> - I love messing with Deena</i>

38:36.114 --> 38:38.114
a little bit, like, when she
gets worked up, I like to work

38:38.183 --> 38:39.616
her up a little bit more.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.584
- What?
- It's a nice spirit.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.186
Deena hates it all.

38:43.255 --> 38:45.322
I was kidding.
There's no spirit in our room.

38:45.390 --> 38:46.990
- Oh, look.
I think something's coming.

38:47.059 --> 38:49.125
- I don't eat fish.
Is this fish?

38:49.194 --> 38:50.327
- It does have
octopus on the top.

38:50.395 --> 38:51.828
There is a...
- Well, save them, ma'am.

38:51.897 --> 38:53.296
- fancy hashbrown...
- What is that?

38:53.398 --> 38:54.764
- And a caviar cream sauce.

38:54.833 --> 38:59.069
So here, we have a yellow
tomato and yellow watermelon

38:59.137 --> 39:00.837
soup for you.
- I love that.

39:00.906 --> 39:03.039
- Ooh.
- That's actually amazing.

39:03.108 --> 39:05.642
Really good.
- Mmm.

39:05.711 --> 39:07.711
- Ooh. Ooh.
- Hmm.

39:07.779 --> 39:08.945
Tastes like wasabi.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.081
- Oh, my God.
Like, we're not this classy.

39:11.149 --> 39:14.718
- Cucumber salad here for you.
- Yes.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.953
- This is cucumber?

39:17.022 --> 39:19.055
- Can I please
have Nachos Grande

39:19.124 --> 39:21.624
and a Crunch Wrap Supreme.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.059
Let's get some fast
food to the room.

39:23.128 --> 39:25.261
Like, that's what you
do on a real vacation.

39:25.330 --> 39:28.898
And a Chipotle Wrap...

39:28.967 --> 39:33.036
- I have to pee.
- From the dollar menu.

39:33.105 --> 39:34.270
- It tastes good.

39:36.241 --> 39:38.475
- More than a splash.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.043
We like heavy pours.

39:40.112 --> 39:41.044
Keep going.

39:41.113 --> 39:42.078
- Thank you.

39:42.147 --> 39:44.748

is fun...

39:52.357 --> 39:54.224
And they're on the verge.

39:54.292 --> 39:55.392

39:55.460 --> 39:57.660
- What?

39:57.729 --> 39:58.728

that could be the end.

40:08.540 --> 40:09.873
- What are the parts?

40:09.941 --> 40:12.275
- Please don't.
- You're like my [bleep] son.

40:12.344 --> 40:16.413
- And also, Angelina 2.0,
I mean, there would

40:16.515 --> 40:18.081
be no California after that.

40:18.150 --> 40:19.482
- I'm holding it in.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.351
- I think it would
finally break off.

40:21.420 --> 40:23.086
- I'm so sorry. I just farted.
[laughs]

40:23.155 --> 40:26.756

- Sorry.
- Go in the corner

40:30.662 --> 40:33.029
and wait for it to go away.
- You can't do that [bleep].
