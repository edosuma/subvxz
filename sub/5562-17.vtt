WEBVTT

00:03.604 --> 00:04.770
Callen:
<i> Sam returned to work</i>

00:04.772 --> 00:06.105
With a cia task force.

00:06.107 --> 00:07.606
Focus of his investigation was

00:07.608 --> 00:09.541
Sudanese ex-governor
tahir khaled.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.310
Hetty:
<i> That's khaled's sister jada.</i>

00:11.312 --> 00:13.278
You'd be asked
to testify against your brother.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.314
What are you
talking about?

00:15.316 --> 00:16.382
<i> I have done everything</i>

00:16.384 --> 00:17.783
Ncis has asked of me.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.785
I want my life back.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.720
Your brother is going
to kill you.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.389
Don't get on that plane.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.090
Will you force
me to stay?

00:25.092 --> 00:26.558
No.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.028
Then this is my choice.

00:38.172 --> 00:41.073
¶ ¶

01:02.596 --> 01:04.163
Agent hanna.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.330
Colonel joaddan salli?

01:05.332 --> 01:06.632
Welcome to eritrea.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.801
This is my partner,
agent callen.
How are you?

01:08.803 --> 01:11.203
Two days ago,
we received intelligence reports

01:11.205 --> 01:13.105
Telling us that thomas karume

01:13.107 --> 01:15.174
And his lord's resistance army
was in the area.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.508
Is this
karume's camp?

01:16.510 --> 01:18.143
What's left of it.

01:18.145 --> 01:20.412
After the artillery,
most of karume's army escaped.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.247
How long have you
been tracking him?

01:22.249 --> 01:23.248
Over ten years.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.017
The lra

01:25.018 --> 01:26.785
Has killed, mutilated and raped
thousands of african people.

01:26.787 --> 01:28.554
Look, we empathize,
and we'd like to help,

01:28.556 --> 01:29.855
But we need to know why

01:29.857 --> 01:31.356
We were brought
halfway across the world.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.858
I can only address
that with agent hanna.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.994
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:34.995 --> 01:37.129
Anything you say to me,
you can say to my partner.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.330
This is for your eyes only.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.866
Please come with me.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.105
I'm sorry.

01:46.107 --> 01:47.506
We've been made aware

01:47.508 --> 01:49.741
Of an intelligence leak
coming out of the

01:49.743 --> 01:52.211
Ncis office
of special projects.

01:52.213 --> 01:55.247
And right now, you are the
only agent who can be trusted.

02:11.765 --> 02:14.333
Why me?

02:15.503 --> 02:16.602
I'm sorry.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.635
¶ ¶

03:07.688 --> 03:10.255
Are they there with them now?

03:10.257 --> 03:13.325
Hetty: Yes, there are six agents
at your home with your family.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.227
What about aiden?

03:15.229 --> 03:17.262
Aiden's been pulled from
the academy. He's with michelle.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.298
Correction: Your family
is no longer at your home.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.265
They have been

03:20.267 --> 03:21.433
Moved to a safe house.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.152
Our office was compromised.

03:23.153 --> 03:24.870
Who knows about the location
of the safe house?

03:24.872 --> 03:27.272
Myself and two former members
of your seal team.

03:27.274 --> 03:30.342
Even ms. Lange doesn't know
where michelle and the kids are.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.510
Uh, you should have
all of the intel

03:31.512 --> 03:32.878
They gathered
on sam and his family now.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.247
Nell: Okay, now we have
to find out how thomas karume,

03:35.249 --> 03:38.517
While on the run in kenya,
uganda and southern sudan,

03:38.519 --> 03:39.851
Received the intel.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.987
He must have a digital conduit
somewhere.
Mm-hmm.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.690
Naval intelligence
is aware of the leak.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.725
What about new intel on karume?

03:46.727 --> 03:48.360
Nothing we didn't
already have.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.695
Cia?
Same.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.163
That doesn't track.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.630
This is one of the most
wanted men on the planet.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.299
Granger:
Welcome to our new reality.

03:54.301 --> 03:56.568
Naval intelligence and cia
now consider us a liability.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.270
Kensi: Yeah, they're
not giving us

03:58.272 --> 03:59.905
Anything until we seal
the breach.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.873
Which means we're on our own.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.242
Very much so.

04:03.244 --> 04:04.576
We have to use
our own contacts.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.811
Sam: The global
criminal tribunal

04:05.813 --> 04:07.779
Convicted karume in absentia,

04:07.781 --> 04:09.381
Of crimes against humanity.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.016
Start with alex elmslie.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.351
He owes us big time.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.453
On it.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.622
I've arranged
for your transport back.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.357
I'm not coming back.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.392
I'm gonna embed
with the african standby force

04:20.394 --> 04:23.362
And attempt to track down
karume and his army.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.731
Granger: You planning
on staying a while?

04:25.733 --> 04:27.833
The man has been on the run
for more than ten years.

04:27.835 --> 04:28.400
I'm not gonna have a
discussion about this.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.007
Thank you for what
you've done for my family.

04:35.009 --> 04:37.576
They're our family, too, sam.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.281
(sighs)

04:42.283 --> 04:45.017
He's not going to find karume,

04:45.019 --> 04:46.418
Mr. Callen.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.487
Yeah, well,
that's unfortunate...

04:48.489 --> 04:50.856
'cause I don't think
he's gonna stop until he does.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.058
And I'm gonna be with him.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.300
Deeks:
Oh, this is all very

05:01.302 --> 05:03.368
Cloak-and-dagger of you,
elmslie.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.503
Is it safe to talk here?

05:05.572 --> 05:07.472
Are you paranoid?

05:07.474 --> 05:08.740
Maybe you should be.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.309
I was collecting
intelligence

05:10.311 --> 05:11.576
On karume, like you asked,

05:11.578 --> 05:13.011
When my search triggered

05:13.013 --> 05:14.680
I.T. Security

05:14.681 --> 05:16.348
To send an automated message
to my superior.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.684
He asked what I was
doing, I explained.

05:18.686 --> 05:21.420
And then he called
our cia contacts.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.356
And told you the ncis office
of special projects has a mole.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.058
Exactly. I couldn't leave
the tribunal office

05:26.060 --> 05:27.426
With even my briefcase.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.394
Deeks: Okay, well, then,
this has been fun.

05:29.396 --> 05:32.431
And as much as I love listening
to your charming british accent,

05:32.433 --> 05:34.767
If that's all you got, then...

05:34.768 --> 05:37.102
If I'm found circumventing
the tribunal, I'll lose my job.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.438
I've been sober four months.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.607
I just got my wife and daughter
to agree to visit me.

05:42.609 --> 05:44.609
Listen, we saved your life.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.712
You owe us.

05:46.714 --> 05:50.349
And that is why I will do
everything I can to help you.

05:50.351 --> 05:51.783
I just need you to understand

05:51.785 --> 05:52.884
The stakes.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.786
We do.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.621
What can you tell us?

05:56.623 --> 05:59.458
During the prosecution
of karume,

05:59.460 --> 06:02.127
I became close
with a man named emmanuel salim.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.796
He was a child soldier
in karume's army.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.932
Now he's here,
working for an organization

06:06.934 --> 06:09.034
Called the center
for south sudanese justice.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.770
They raise money to aid
in karume's capture.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.005
If there's anyone could
tell you something about karume,

06:14.007 --> 06:15.607
It's salim.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.043
How can we talk to him?

06:18.045 --> 06:19.778
That's the address

06:19.780 --> 06:21.613
For the center
for south sudanese justice.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.515
It's three blocks from here.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.883
Salim's expecting you.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.451
I can't be seen there.

06:26.453 --> 06:28.120
Let me know what he says.

06:28.122 --> 06:29.888
Whoa. Where are you going?

06:29.890 --> 06:31.523
I'm going to talk
to some of my other contacts,

06:31.525 --> 06:33.058
See what else
I can find for you.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.793
Thank you.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.728
Yeah, thank you.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.797
It's the least I could do.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.968
(car engine starts)

06:42.970 --> 06:45.804
Thomas karume
came to my village,

06:45.806 --> 06:47.739
He killed my father,

06:47.741 --> 06:50.742
And he took me, at nine,
and my brother, at 12,

06:50.744 --> 06:53.078
To fight
in the lord's resistance army.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.847
It was all in the name
of cleansing

06:55.849 --> 06:58.183
And purifying the acholi,
my people.

06:59.887 --> 07:03.088
Karume refers to himself
as "hitler" and "king david."

07:03.090 --> 07:04.890
Really, he's just
running a cult.

07:04.892 --> 07:05.991
A very violent cult.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.459
Indeed.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.728
My brother died fighting
in karume's army

07:09.730 --> 07:11.430
When he was 14 years old.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.565
I'm so sorry
to hear that.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.200
Thank you.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.035
How does he have access
to internet?

07:17.037 --> 07:18.570
(knocking)

07:18.572 --> 07:21.006
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.841
I'm sorry to interrupt.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.576
I'm evan labelle.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.478
I'm the founder; I'm the ceo.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.579
Detective deeks.
Special agent blye.

07:27.581 --> 07:28.847
Hi.
Hey.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.949
I want to apologize
on behalf of mr. Salim.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.685
He has obviously forgotten the
protocol in these situations.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.021
And what is that protocol?
Well, I'm sure

07:36.023 --> 07:38.557
You are aware, the information
we gather is highly sensitive.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.192
So you're more
than welcome

07:40.194 --> 07:41.927
To present us
with a list of questions,

07:41.929 --> 07:44.863
And I'll be sure to clear them
through our board of directors,

07:44.865 --> 07:47.499
As well as our contacts
at the cia.

07:47.501 --> 07:48.500
Actually, we're in a
little bit of a rush.

07:48.502 --> 07:49.801
One of our
agent's family's

07:49.803 --> 07:52.237
Is being directly
threatened by karume, so...

07:52.239 --> 07:54.206
Well, we have an obligation
to protect our information.

07:54.208 --> 07:57.108
Look, like I said, I'm happy
to pass your questions along,

07:57.110 --> 07:59.311
But until then, I'm sorry,

07:59.312 --> 08:01.513
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave. Please.

08:01.515 --> 08:04.649
Mm-hmm. Okay.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.718
Thank you.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.259
All right.
Eric: Got it.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.061
Thank you.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.230
So eric didn't find
anything on labelle,

08:18.232 --> 08:21.533
But salim got stopped in arizona
with an ounce of marijuana.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.504
And that can be charged
as a felony there.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.072
Yes, it can.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.741
Are we really gonna
do this to him

08:29.743 --> 08:31.042
After everything
he's been through?

08:31.044 --> 08:32.644
I mean, if sam's family
wasn't in danger,

08:32.646 --> 08:33.712
I think we could
try something else,

08:33.714 --> 08:34.946
But unless
you have a better idea,

08:34.948 --> 08:36.515
I think we got
to roll with this.

08:36.517 --> 08:37.282
He's coming.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.084
Let's go.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.119
You sure?
Yeah.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.189
Mr. Salim.

08:44.758 --> 08:45.957
Hello.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.759
We'd love to ask you
a few more questions,

08:47.761 --> 08:49.828
Completely off the record,
labelle doesn't need to know.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.296
(scoffs)
kensi: Come on.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.697
Please just help us out.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.733
I cannot.
I would be fired.

08:56.270 --> 08:58.904
We know about
the marijuana charge in arizona.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.940
It was just a small amount.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.775
Yeah, but there's still
a warrant for your arrest.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.310
All right, listen, you talk
to us, answer some questions,

09:05.312 --> 09:08.013
We'll take care of that.
It's not gonna be a problem.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.083
And if I don't?

09:12.085 --> 09:14.653
Then we extradite you...

09:14.655 --> 09:16.955
Back to the land of
sun and guns.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.893
Please get in the car.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.895
We have a place we
can speak privately.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.907
Whoever took these
must have been trained.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.809
Yeah, you and michelle would
have noticed otherwise.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.645
You can tell by the position of
the sun in each of the photos,

09:40.647 --> 09:42.914
They were observing 24/7.

09:42.916 --> 09:46.151
It's recon. They were
definitely planning something.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.755
These are frames
taken yesterday,

09:50.757 --> 09:52.123
Grabbed from
african union drones.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.794
We've been tracking
karume's men.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.295
Sam: Zoom in on that
group of women.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.833
It's jada.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.935
You think
she's with karume by choice?

10:03.937 --> 10:08.773
Karume takes women prisoners,
uses them as sex slaves.

10:08.775 --> 10:09.774
(keypad beeps)

10:09.776 --> 10:12.210
Callen:
That's tahir khaled.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.678
Jada's brother.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.847
That's why she's here.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.882
Began aiding karume
late last year.

10:17.884 --> 10:20.251
It's not karume
who's after you and your family.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.721
It's tahir khaled.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.634
Colonel salli:
Karume and his men arrived here

10:35.636 --> 10:37.769
After traveling months
through ethiopia.

10:37.771 --> 10:40.872
We believe they were
in this camp for only a week.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.907
Sam: By now, they could have
gone 300 miles in any direction.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.676
Callen: They head towards
djibouti, they're gonna be

10:44.678 --> 10:46.795
Trapped to the
east by water.

10:46.796 --> 10:48.913
Backtracking toward ethiopia--
that's too risky at this point.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.715
Sam:
Here. Ad-damar.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.851
Tahir has a farm out there.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.686
That's where they held me
four years ago.

10:54.688 --> 10:55.887
It's isolated.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.055
We should leave now.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.356
I'm afraid
it's not that easy.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.091
Must get approval
from the african union

11:00.093 --> 11:01.826
Before crossing
international borders.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.129
Must be sanctioned
by the asf governing body.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.264
You need approval.
I don't.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.700
If something happens,
we will not be able to help you.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.702
Sam, even if we find tahir,

11:10.704 --> 11:11.903
He's not gonna talk.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.204
Jada will.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.706
If she knows how tahir

11:14.708 --> 11:16.941
Got ahold of that intel,
she'll tell us.

11:16.943 --> 11:19.244
We'll trace it back to the mole.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.879
You're sure you can trust her?

11:20.881 --> 11:23.181
Yeah.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.150
Salli:
I don't need to tell you,

11:25.152 --> 11:27.118
Agent hanna,
that these are dangerous men.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.421
Entire armies have been
slaughtered by their hands.

11:29.423 --> 11:30.989
Colonel...

11:30.991 --> 11:33.124
We need a jeep.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.732
Salim:
<i> Thomas karume interacts</i>
<i> with very few people.</i>

11:40.734 --> 11:43.001
He's made
an entire nation fear him,

11:43.003 --> 11:44.769
And he's evaded
an international manhunt

11:44.771 --> 11:46.071
For over a decade.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.073
The lra has
limited resources,

11:48.075 --> 11:50.308
So how does he
continuously avoid capture?

11:50.310 --> 11:53.745
The less resources one uses,
the less there is to track.

11:53.747 --> 11:54.913
What about a
digital trail?

11:54.915 --> 11:56.815
Does he ever use a
satellite connection?

11:56.817 --> 11:59.417
Karume never has and never will
trust technology.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.986
No phones, no texts.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.988
I don't believe
he's ever sent an e-mail.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.857
(phone ringing)

12:05.859 --> 12:07.959
It's elmslie.
Excuse me.

12:08.895 --> 12:09.961
Hello.
Kensi...

12:09.963 --> 12:11.096
I need to speak to you
right away.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.864
What is it?

12:12.866 --> 12:14.766
I made a few calls, and, um...

12:14.768 --> 12:15.867
There's somebody

12:15.869 --> 12:17.736
You need to speak to.
Okay.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.370
Not on the phone.
In person.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.005
I'll text you my address.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.040
It's important.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.042
Okay. We'll be
right there. Bye.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.410
Elmslie wants to meet

12:25.412 --> 12:27.912
At his apartment,
and he sounds scared.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.848
That's not good.
I need to get back

12:29.850 --> 12:32.050
To work-- labelle
has fired people for less.
We're gonna talk

12:32.052 --> 12:34.853
To elmslie first, and then
if we don't need anything
else, we'll release you.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.988
(door opens)

12:41.128 --> 12:43.228
¶ ¶

12:55.041 --> 12:57.075
Sam:
One guard in front.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.244
Callen (over radio): Yeah,
there's one out back as well.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.478
It's too quiet.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.313
There's no way
karume and the lra are here.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.983
Sam:
Well, somebody is.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.117
Callen:
All right.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.119
Why don't we try
and smoke them out.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.387
See how many we got.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.456
I'll take the front.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.495
Kens, door.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.504
One, two, three.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.107
Federal agents!
Elmslie?

13:38.051 --> 13:40.118
Kensi:
Clear!

13:41.922 --> 13:43.121
Clear!

13:43.123 --> 13:45.123
Hey, kens...

13:45.125 --> 13:46.324
You should probably
see this.

13:49.563 --> 13:52.564
Okay, that's
a fair amount of blood.

13:52.566 --> 13:54.866
Yeah, but if they
wanted him dead,

13:54.868 --> 13:57.101
They would have killed
him right here.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.270
I'll call it in, see if there's
any security cameras

13:59.272 --> 14:00.271
In the neighborhood.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.540
(line ringing)

14:02.542 --> 14:05.043
Nell:
Hey, kens. What have you got?

14:05.045 --> 14:07.111
(flames crackling)

14:12.152 --> 14:14.252
(muffled grunting)

14:23.463 --> 14:25.096
¶ ¶

14:27.200 --> 14:29.534
(grunting)

14:30.537 --> 14:32.170
(grunts)

14:32.172 --> 14:35.073
(groaning weakly)

14:39.079 --> 14:41.579
(sports broadcast plays
on tv, crowd cheering)

14:42.549 --> 14:43.615
(door shuts in distance)

14:52.525 --> 14:54.926
Sam: Hello, tahir.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.462
I told you not to get used
to your freedom.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.580
Poetically...

15:15.582 --> 15:19.083
The roles are now reversed.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.619
You are
interrogating<i> me.</i>

15:21.621 --> 15:25.023
It must give you a great sense
of satisfaction.

15:27.193 --> 15:29.527
Who gave you the information
about my family?

15:29.529 --> 15:32.931
Tahir: (chuckles) is that
what this is about?

15:32.933 --> 15:34.966
I thought it was something else,

15:34.968 --> 15:37.602
Something... More personal.

15:37.604 --> 15:38.670
Answer the question.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.405
I prefer to use
that information

15:40.407 --> 15:42.974
As a bargaining chip
at a later date.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.509
If we find our mole without you,

15:44.511 --> 15:46.377
You're gonna lose
that bargaining chip.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.984
Of all the questions, is that
really the one on your mind?

15:54.020 --> 15:57.355
When someone threatens
my family...

15:57.357 --> 16:00.558
It's the only thing on my mind.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.229
You and I are alike.

16:05.231 --> 16:09.233
You... Don't actually have
concern for your family.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.170
Is, uh...

16:12.172 --> 16:15.073
What is her name?

16:15.642 --> 16:17.108
Ah.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.409
Yes.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.612
Michelle...

16:23.350 --> 16:24.716
...Really that important to you?

16:27.988 --> 16:30.521
Or does your allegiance
lie elsewhere?

16:30.523 --> 16:33.591
(grunting)

16:35.695 --> 16:37.996
(tahir choking)

16:41.067 --> 16:43.735
My family means
everything to me.

16:43.737 --> 16:47.071
You come
after them...

16:47.073 --> 16:49.073
(choking, groaning)

16:49.075 --> 16:51.442
...I'll burn you alive.

16:54.381 --> 16:57.115
(gasping)

17:02.288 --> 17:04.088
Now...

17:06.326 --> 17:08.393
...As I was saying...

17:09.729 --> 17:13.097
...Who gave you the information
about my family?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.701
You want to kill me...

17:16.703 --> 17:19.303
But you need
my information,

17:19.305 --> 17:22.240
So you can't.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.709
You want to torture me...

17:24.711 --> 17:29.280
But an inability to do that
has been inbred in you.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.682
And so...

17:31.684 --> 17:35.053
I still have the power.

17:37.590 --> 17:41.259
I'm gonna need to spend
some time alone with him.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.627
No one's ever gonna know

17:42.629 --> 17:44.662
What happens down here,
but you and me.

17:46.332 --> 17:48.699
You do what you got to do.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.438
¶ ¶

18:01.514 --> 18:04.115
Jada's not with tahir.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.384
Nell:
Elmslie did say

18:06.385 --> 18:08.652
Tahir was bringing jada
back to sudan to kill her.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.622
If it's too late,
then someone...

18:11.624 --> 18:12.690
We should tell sam.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.358
Exactly.
I'll comb through

18:14.360 --> 18:16.160
Asf's drone footage,
see if I can determine

18:16.162 --> 18:17.829
The last place
she was seen alive.

18:17.831 --> 18:20.231
Any news about jada

18:20.233 --> 18:22.767
Comes directly to me.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.802
Not mr. Callen,

18:24.804 --> 18:27.105
And certainly
not mr. Hanna.

18:32.545 --> 18:35.313
No keys, no phone,
no wallet.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.348
Not much else in this place
worth taking.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.784
It's a far cry from
the house he lived in

18:39.786 --> 18:40.785
With his wife
and daughter.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.487
Well, he probably doesn't want

18:42.489 --> 18:44.455
To settle
into a bachelor lifestyle.
Elmslie lost his family

18:44.457 --> 18:46.574
Trying to save the world.
Listen, nobody takes

18:46.575 --> 18:48.692
This job because they want
the white picket fence.
Yeah, I know.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.796
But at least you and I
have somebody to go home to.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.132
Nell (over radio):
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.467
Elmslie's phone is off,
so I wasn't able to track him,

18:56.469 --> 19:00.138
But I was able to see that
he made eight calls today,
all to the same number.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.406
Okay, you're either
burying a lead or we...

19:02.408 --> 19:03.875
We don't know whose number
it is-- it's untraceable.

19:03.877 --> 19:05.476
Kensie:
Which of elmslie's contacts

19:05.478 --> 19:07.411
Would use untraceable phones?

19:07.413 --> 19:08.713
Man: Keep your hands where
I can see them.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.181
Turn around.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.416
Man:
Slowly.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.218
Where is elmslie?

19:14.220 --> 19:15.887
Depends on who
wants to know.

19:15.889 --> 19:17.822
Believe me,
I can kill you and her

19:17.824 --> 19:20.191
Before either of you
pulls out your weapon.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.360
Well, now you're
just bragging.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.595
Is the blood his?

19:24.597 --> 19:25.596
We think so.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.898
Who are you?

19:26.900 --> 19:29.233
You were just asking
who elmslie could be calling

19:29.235 --> 19:31.869
With a number
that can't be traced.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.404
Think about it.

19:33.406 --> 19:34.939
Yoda?

19:34.941 --> 19:36.240
Cia.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.942
That was my second guess.

19:38.912 --> 19:41.179
Alfred mahdi.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.180
Detective deeks, lapd.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.414
Kensi blye...

19:43.416 --> 19:44.448
Ncis.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.616
Nell:
Confirmed.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.652
Cia agent alfred mahdi.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.687
Just sent a photo to your phone.
(phone chimes)

19:49.688 --> 19:51.721
He's been working
with the agency for 12 years.

19:51.724 --> 19:53.391
Recruited out of harvard.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.693
Currently a member
of a joint task force

19:55.695 --> 19:57.695
Working to find
thomas karume.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.830
Wow, harvard. You fancy.

19:59.832 --> 20:02.200
So elmslie wanted us
to speak to his contact?

20:02.202 --> 20:04.302
That's you?

20:04.304 --> 20:07.271
Now, don't tell me you're
gonna get all cia coy on us.

20:07.273 --> 20:11.676
Let's just say I have security
concerns about your office.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.344
Ah. Right. Yeah.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.347
Zoinks.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.482
Uh, yeah, you can't hear
our earwigs, but we
just got a "zoinks,"

20:18.484 --> 20:20.484
Which is usually
never good.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.620
Eric:
I ran a search of wire transfers
ending in countries

20:22.622 --> 20:25.456
Associated with karume--
there are over 30 banks

20:25.458 --> 20:28.960
In major cities across northeast
africa that have received funds,

20:28.962 --> 20:31.829
All routed through
this one shell company.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.698
Can we track who's funding
the shell company?

20:33.700 --> 20:34.966
Nell:
Well, it's not that easy.

20:34.968 --> 20:37.235
It looks like the
money's being routed

20:37.237 --> 20:39.370
Through dozens of banks
all across the world.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.239
Any way to connect
those banks to karume?

20:41.241 --> 20:42.590
Eric:
Each bank processes

20:42.591 --> 20:43.940
Thousands of transactions
every day.

20:43.943 --> 20:47.011
It's gonna take some time
to pinpoint a common thread.

20:47.981 --> 20:50.548
Certified national bank.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.916
3rd and highfield.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.517
You got anything else?

20:53.519 --> 20:54.919
Cross-check each of those banks

20:54.921 --> 20:57.555
With accounts associated
with that branch.

20:57.557 --> 20:58.723
You get that, beale?

20:58.725 --> 20:59.824
On it.

20:59.826 --> 21:00.925
Thought you didn't trust us.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.560
You were almost there.

21:02.562 --> 21:03.995
Might as well help you out.

21:03.997 --> 21:05.496
How kind of you.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.398
Eric: That's it--
each of the international banks

21:07.400 --> 21:09.934
Received a transfer
from the same account number

21:09.936 --> 21:11.435
Originating here in l.A.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.903
Nell:
That's strange.

21:12.905 --> 21:15.273
That's the same account
number for the center

21:15.275 --> 21:16.540
For south sudanese justice.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.609
So the organization

21:18.610 --> 21:20.677
Working to stop karume
is actually funding him?

21:20.680 --> 21:22.513
Well, that's a zoinks, indeed.

21:32.525 --> 21:35.326
Hetty, tahir still
hasn't given us anything

21:35.328 --> 21:37.061
On karume or on jada.

21:37.063 --> 21:40.331
Has jada joined her brother
willingly?

21:40.333 --> 21:41.832
Well, sam will tell you
there's no way.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.668
But you're not so sure?

21:43.670 --> 21:45.253
No one held a gun

21:45.254 --> 21:46.837
To her head
when she got on that plane.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.774
Your partner
is going to want to find her.

21:49.776 --> 21:52.376
And find out who leaked
that intel about his family.

21:52.378 --> 21:54.045
Regardless of whose
side she's on,

21:54.046 --> 21:55.713
She may know how that intel
got to her brother.

21:55.715 --> 21:58.299
So you and sam

21:58.300 --> 22:00.884
Are going to take on the entire
lord's resistance army

22:00.887 --> 22:02.586
To rescue her?

22:02.588 --> 22:04.722
Sam would for his family.

22:04.724 --> 22:05.990
That's why,

22:05.992 --> 22:07.692
Before you do anything foolish,

22:07.694 --> 22:10.061
I want you both back here now.

22:10.063 --> 22:12.596
I can't tell sam
to just walk away.

22:12.598 --> 22:13.798
No, but I'm going to ask

22:13.800 --> 22:17.735
Secnav to order
a special operations team

22:17.737 --> 22:20.871
To extract tahir immediately.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.840
If sam wants
to interrogate him,

22:22.842 --> 22:24.909
He can do it someplace safe.

22:24.911 --> 22:27.712
Preferably a black site
in poland.

22:27.714 --> 22:31.549
You just make sure your partner
is on that plane with you.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.384
Okay.

22:33.386 --> 22:34.919
Okay.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.987
Thanks.
(hangs up)

22:40.460 --> 22:42.860
There's been a
development, owen.

22:44.864 --> 22:48.065
We've just received
drone footage

22:48.067 --> 22:49.433
Of jada khaled.

22:49.435 --> 22:51.602
Alive.
And now

22:51.604 --> 22:53.904
We know where
she is.
Yeah.

22:56.376 --> 22:59.477
Looks like she's being held
by five of karume's men.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.479
Yes, it does.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.080
I also know you didn't
tell sam and callen

23:03.082 --> 23:06.117
That we have
a good idea of where she is.

23:06.119 --> 23:08.819
You want to
second-guess me, too?

23:08.821 --> 23:11.122
You're probably doing
enough of that yourself.

23:11.124 --> 23:14.158
I'm just too old to lose them.

23:14.160 --> 23:18.062
What if jada can explain
where tahir got the intel?

23:18.064 --> 23:20.431
We can trace it back
to our mole.

23:20.433 --> 23:21.866
That's not the reason

23:21.868 --> 23:24.535
He wants to find her,
and you know it.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.771
I think you're underestimating

23:26.773 --> 23:29.573
Sam's obligation to jada.

23:29.575 --> 23:32.042
I am fully aware
of sam's obligation

23:32.044 --> 23:33.878
To that woman.

23:35.848 --> 23:38.916
Obligation can be
a powerful emotion.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.918
Is that from...

23:40.920 --> 23:43.421
Your personal experience, owen?

23:46.159 --> 23:49.727
He'll never be at peace
leaving her over there.

23:51.197 --> 23:54.165
And god help you if she dies.

23:54.167 --> 23:57.535
If it keeps sam alive,

23:57.537 --> 23:59.670
Let him hate me.

23:59.672 --> 24:02.606
I can live with that.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.111
(tahir gasping)

24:09.115 --> 24:12.016
(raspy breathing)

24:16.889 --> 24:19.123
(groaning)

24:23.029 --> 24:25.996
(grunting, choking)

24:28.067 --> 24:30.067
What are you doing?

24:30.069 --> 24:31.702
You're going to hang me?

24:31.704 --> 24:33.103
Nah. Not gonna hang you.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.972
Just want to make sure
you don't run away.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.174
This is the bark of a dog

24:37.176 --> 24:40.010
With no bite.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.912
Don't move around
too much.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.147
I don't want you
to hurt yourself

24:43.149 --> 24:45.483
If that chair
tips over.

24:47.053 --> 24:48.986
Kill me,

24:48.988 --> 24:50.120
And you will never know

24:50.122 --> 24:52.490
Who's betraying you
from the inside.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.894
Kill you.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.996
I would never
do that.

24:58.998 --> 25:02.600
I would have to
go crazy. Lose it.

25:02.602 --> 25:05.870
Which, as a trained navy
seal and ncis agent,

25:05.872 --> 25:07.838
Could never happen.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.975
So what are we doing?

25:10.977 --> 25:12.643
We're just talking.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.912
I'm asking questions.

25:14.914 --> 25:16.981
You're answering.

25:16.983 --> 25:19.016
All good.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.085
That is, till
it's not good.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.222
And then?

25:25.224 --> 25:26.257
Ah...

25:26.259 --> 25:27.725
Let's not
think about that.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.660
Think positive.

25:29.662 --> 25:31.161
I do.

25:31.163 --> 25:35.132
Even when then people
I work with are in danger,

25:35.134 --> 25:38.168
The lives of my wife
and children are threatened.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.172
I just look at
the bright side of life.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.117
So...

25:55.855 --> 25:58.656
Who gave you the information
about my family?

25:58.658 --> 26:02.059
That isn't what
you really want to know.

26:02.061 --> 26:05.162
What you really
want to know is...

26:05.164 --> 26:07.631
Is jada alive?

26:07.633 --> 26:11.569
Is she being tortured
as we speak?

26:11.571 --> 26:13.237
She's not my concern right now.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.205
You can fool the world,
but I have

26:15.207 --> 26:17.308
Seen with my own eyes.

26:17.310 --> 26:20.044
I have witnessed your
and jada's relationship.

26:20.046 --> 26:22.713
I know.
Know what?

26:22.715 --> 26:24.915
That you did, indeed,
love her!

26:24.917 --> 26:28.018
And if you kill me,

26:28.020 --> 26:31.188
You will never know her fate.

26:31.190 --> 26:34.191
Callen:
Sam...

26:34.193 --> 26:36.994
We need to talk.

26:41.701 --> 26:43.767
(gasps)

26:52.945 --> 26:55.245
Colonel salli
has ordered an extraction.

26:55.247 --> 26:58.148
A special ops team is on
their way to take tahir away.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.217
I need more time with him.

27:00.219 --> 27:01.986
You can interrogate him
once we're out of the country.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.988
We have tahir, okay?

27:03.990 --> 27:05.322
The immediate threat
to your family is over.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.824
Eventually we will
find the leak.

27:06.826 --> 27:09.126
Jada may know how tahir
got that information.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.794
It'd be stupid to stop now.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.230
G, this has

27:13.232 --> 27:15.265
Nothing to do with
what tahir said to me.

27:17.203 --> 27:19.203
Asf is gonna be here
in two hours.

27:19.205 --> 27:21.238
I'm not leaving, g.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.881
Nell:
<i> Now, labelle is a con man</i>
<i> out of marseilles.</i>

27:30.883 --> 27:32.850
The reason we couldn't
find anything on him

27:32.852 --> 27:36.687
Is labelle is an alias.
His real name is pons laurent.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.989
He's wanted for a string
of crimes across France

27:38.991 --> 27:40.991
And believed to have strong ties

27:40.993 --> 27:42.226
To the french-corsican mafia.

27:42.228 --> 27:44.762
What is laurent's connection
to karume?

27:44.764 --> 27:46.664
He's just a mercenary
running a fake charity

27:46.666 --> 27:49.767
To collect money and funnel
information back to karume.

27:49.769 --> 27:52.002
I bet he's getting
a nice cut for his efforts.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.871
It's a brilliant plan
on karume's part.

27:53.873 --> 27:56.240
Collect funds to aid
in his own capture.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.809
Then use the money
to support his army.

27:58.811 --> 28:01.111
And the lra gains direct
intel on who's after them,

28:01.113 --> 28:03.247
How much they know
and how they're being tracked.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.816
The cia says the center
for south sudanese justice

28:05.818 --> 28:07.317
Has been using the dark net.

28:07.319 --> 28:09.987
It's probably how laurent
is communicating with karume.

28:09.989 --> 28:11.855
And it's most likely
how the intel on sam

28:11.857 --> 28:13.991
And his family
was sent to tahir.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.260
Salim was saying karume
doesn't trust computers and now

28:16.262 --> 28:18.796
The cia's saying that he's been
using the dark net for years?

28:18.798 --> 28:20.297
That is pretty disturbing.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.966
What if salim
is working for karume?

28:22.968 --> 28:25.235
He was a member of karume's lra.

28:25.237 --> 28:26.804
Kensi: And a huge part
of karume's process

28:26.806 --> 28:29.406
Is brainwashing the children
that he's kidnapped.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.241
Deeks: I'll do you
one better--

28:31.243 --> 28:34.712
What if it's not just
salim and laurent?

28:34.714 --> 28:37.347
What if everybody in that office
is working for karume?

28:48.761 --> 28:51.495
Go! Move! Move out!

28:51.497 --> 28:54.264
(soldier shouting orders
in distance)

28:54.266 --> 28:56.166
There's a helicopter
waiting for you

28:56.168 --> 28:57.935
Just across the border
in south sudan.

28:58.838 --> 29:02.139
I am very much looking forward
to coming to los angeles.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.374
We're not taking you to the u.S.

29:04.376 --> 29:07.177
Put mr. Khaled
in the truck.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.445
And keep a gun on him.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.514
Soldier:
Yes, colonel.

29:11.484 --> 29:12.816
Come, let's go.

29:12.818 --> 29:14.218
Get up.
Get-get up.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.220
The helicopter will take you
to bentiu airport,

29:16.222 --> 29:18.822
Where u.S. Special forces
will be waiting to meet you.

29:18.824 --> 29:21.158
You can ride with me.
Colonel.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.327
Any new intel on karume?

29:23.329 --> 29:24.862
No.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.363
He's like a ghost.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.332
But I will find
him one day.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.900
He will see justice.

29:29.902 --> 29:31.368
I did receive this.

29:33.873 --> 29:36.273
It came anonymously through
the u.S. Embassy in juba.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.908
I thought you should see it.

29:39.145 --> 29:40.377
Do you know where this is?

29:40.379 --> 29:42.312
It's embedded
with gps coordinates,

29:42.314 --> 29:44.248
But these photos
are over ten hours old.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.183
We don't know who sent that.
It could be a trap.

29:46.185 --> 29:48.218
You go with these guys.
I'll check it out.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.486
Send the location to my phone.

29:49.488 --> 29:50.487
Callen:
She's with a group

29:50.489 --> 29:52.289
Of heavily-armed guys.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.924
You're not going without me.

29:55.361 --> 29:56.860
You should have the coordinates.

29:56.862 --> 29:59.196
It's only 100 kilometers
to the west.

29:59.198 --> 30:01.565
We'll camp here
for the night.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.467
If we don't hear from you,

30:03.468 --> 30:05.368
We will take tahir back
to south sudan in the morning.

30:05.371 --> 30:06.203
Okay.

30:06.205 --> 30:07.938
Thank you, colonel.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.208
Thanks.

30:11.210 --> 30:14.244
I have to do this.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.113
You don't.

30:16.115 --> 30:17.915
It's like you always say:

30:17.917 --> 30:19.883
It's just what we do.

30:19.885 --> 30:21.885
Mm.

30:21.887 --> 30:24.221
You better hurry up,
I'm not waiting.

30:24.223 --> 30:26.156
You know hetty's gonna kill us.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.993
Won't matter.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.429
We'll probably die
trying to fight tahir's men.

30:34.867 --> 30:36.200
You're welcome.

30:49.849 --> 30:51.315
Right this way.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.350
Kens, did you bring the popcorn?
'cause I forgot the popcorn.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.219
Ooh, I didn't
bring the popcorn.

30:55.221 --> 30:57.521
That is too bad, 'cause it's
gonna be one hell of a show.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.189
And...

30:59.191 --> 31:01.525
There we are.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.094
Were you aware that evan labelle
was having direct communication

31:04.096 --> 31:05.295
With thomas karume and other

31:05.297 --> 31:06.897
High-ranking officers
of the lra?

31:06.899 --> 31:08.198
That's impossible.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.967
Evan devoted years
to finding karume.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.134
(chuckles)
here I thought

31:11.136 --> 31:12.936
The show was gonna be
on the big screen,

31:12.938 --> 31:13.871
But turns out the oscar
gold is right here.

31:13.873 --> 31:14.938
Hmm.

31:16.876 --> 31:19.943
We thought that this was
happening behind your back

31:19.945 --> 31:22.980
Until we found footage of you
authorizing transfers to the lra

31:22.982 --> 31:24.281
From the same bank.

31:24.283 --> 31:25.616
Evan asked me
to make those transfers.

31:25.618 --> 31:26.950
I had no idea
where they were going.

31:26.952 --> 31:28.118
Don't you mean pons laurent?

31:28.120 --> 31:30.554
Yeah, we know
everything about him.

31:30.556 --> 31:31.989
You know what I really loved?

31:31.991 --> 31:34.191
I loved the bit about
not trusting technology.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.559
You know?
'cause it was simple.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.027
It was understated.
You turned in

31:37.029 --> 31:38.395
A tour de force
performance,

31:38.397 --> 31:41.365
But, uh... Show's over.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.106
Who are you?

31:49.108 --> 31:50.474
No.

31:50.476 --> 31:53.110
This is about you, my friend.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.548
I tried to leave.

31:58.550 --> 32:00.601
Many times.

32:00.602 --> 32:02.653
And karume threatened to
torture and kill my wife and son

32:02.655 --> 32:06.056
If I did not come to the united
states to work for laurent.

32:06.058 --> 32:07.491
My son is...

32:07.493 --> 32:10.093
He was just a baby.
I had no choice.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.962
Why bring in laurent?

32:11.964 --> 32:14.498
Karume said we needed a white
face to give it legitimacy.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.066
Laurent has elmslie?

32:16.068 --> 32:18.302
He knew elmslie
brought you to me.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.270
He wanted to find out
what elmslie knew.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.972
Where would laurent take him?

32:24.143 --> 32:26.043
The artist colonies downtown.

32:26.045 --> 32:27.611
Laurent has an office there.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.146
I'll call nell, get an address.

32:45.030 --> 32:46.630
Should we wait for mahdi?

32:46.632 --> 32:48.699
Elmslie's
probably being tortured.

32:53.405 --> 32:55.072
You ready?

32:59.044 --> 33:01.044
Think salim lied to us?

33:01.046 --> 33:03.046
Yeah, this isn't art.

33:03.048 --> 33:04.481
This is someone
whose art teacher

33:04.483 --> 33:06.717
Should've called their
guidance counselor years ago.

33:06.719 --> 33:08.185
Check it out.

33:09.421 --> 33:10.754
(gunshots)
down!

33:12.491 --> 33:14.391
I changed my mind--
I want the white picket fence,

33:14.393 --> 33:16.393
'cause people with white
picket fences never get shot.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.095
That wouldn't be any fun.
Get down!

33:18.097 --> 33:19.696
(man grunts)

33:20.099 --> 33:21.498
(yells)

33:22.434 --> 33:23.066
(man grunts)

33:27.539 --> 33:28.505
(groans)

33:32.478 --> 33:34.244
You're out of
options, laurent.

33:38.083 --> 33:41.018
Kensi:
Be smart. It's over.

33:41.020 --> 33:43.553
Your prison sentence goes
to life if elmslie dies.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.422
(panting):
I can get you a deal

33:45.424 --> 33:48.558
If you testify against
the former members
of karume's army.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.094
What are you offering?

33:51.096 --> 33:54.131
I'll get you five
years, out in two.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.465
It's a good deal.
I would take it.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.034
I'd put the gun down.

33:57.036 --> 33:59.136
Kensi:
Put it down. Do it!

33:59.138 --> 34:01.304
Deeks:
Put it down.

34:01.306 --> 34:02.773
(exhales)

34:07.046 --> 34:08.578
(panting)

34:12.718 --> 34:14.618
Oh, I thought you
were smarter than that.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.620
What are you talking about?

34:16.622 --> 34:19.589
You aided and abetted a known
terrorist and mass murderer.

34:19.591 --> 34:22.592
Not to mention fraud charges.

34:22.594 --> 34:25.195
I have no authority
to cut you a deal.

34:26.165 --> 34:27.464
Kensi:
I do.

34:27.466 --> 34:29.199
How does life in prison

34:29.201 --> 34:30.734
Without the possibility
of parole sound?

34:31.837 --> 34:33.703
Sounds like justice to me.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.773
Take him away.

34:40.279 --> 34:42.112
Thank you.

34:42.114 --> 34:44.381
It's the least we can do.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.584
(sighs deeply)

34:54.526 --> 34:56.526
I know you don't want
to hear this...

34:56.528 --> 34:58.862
Then don't say it.

34:58.864 --> 35:00.864
This could all be a setup.

35:00.866 --> 35:03.700
Tahir, the farm, jada--
they might be

35:03.702 --> 35:06.103
Funneling us in here
so they can ambush us.

35:06.105 --> 35:08.171
G, I know jada.

35:08.173 --> 35:11.608
No matter how angry
she is with me, she
would never turn on me.

35:12.578 --> 35:15.145
Let's do it.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.183
Don't move.

35:20.185 --> 35:21.685
Where's the girl?

35:21.687 --> 35:23.653
Where is she?

35:23.655 --> 35:25.155
Put down your weapon.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.660
I said... Put down
your weapon.

35:32.831 --> 35:35.198
Sam!

35:35.200 --> 35:37.267
Agent callen!

35:38.337 --> 35:41.171
Drop your weapons.

35:41.173 --> 35:43.640
So...

35:43.642 --> 35:47.511
You have come to
rescue me again.

35:47.513 --> 35:50.514
I never thought
this is who you were.

35:50.516 --> 35:53.350
You think these men
are with tahir?

35:53.352 --> 35:54.718
Or karume.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.788
They rescued me from my brother.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.560
¶ ¶

36:05.164 --> 36:06.563
Sam...

36:07.533 --> 36:10.233
This is patrick badri.

36:10.235 --> 36:13.737
He's a colonel in the
south sudanese army.

36:15.841 --> 36:18.341
And he...

36:18.343 --> 36:21.411
He's also my fiancé.

36:29.288 --> 36:32.189
I've heard a lot about you,
mr. Hanna.

37:00.252 --> 37:02.352
Patrick...

37:02.354 --> 37:04.955
May I have a moment
alone with sam?

37:04.957 --> 37:07.224
Patrick:
Of course.

37:10.329 --> 37:12.862
I have been in contact
with patrick

37:12.864 --> 37:14.431
For the last three years.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.000
How did he find you?

37:17.970 --> 37:21.771
It was I who found him.

37:21.773 --> 37:24.874
We were in love once,
many years ago.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.343
(chuckles): We...

37:26.345 --> 37:29.579
We were only
teenagers then.

37:29.581 --> 37:34.317
Being alone in america
for all of that time

37:34.319 --> 37:37.020
Made me long
for those days.

37:37.022 --> 37:40.290
And that is why I
returned to africa.

37:42.361 --> 37:44.294
But your brother
got to you first.

37:44.296 --> 37:46.429
Yes.

37:46.431 --> 37:50.500
Tahir was waiting for me
when I landed back in sudan.

37:50.502 --> 37:53.770
Can patrick protect you
from tahir's people?

37:55.440 --> 37:57.774
I will have the entire

37:57.776 --> 38:00.343
South sudan army at my back.

38:00.345 --> 38:02.412
Not to mention...

38:02.414 --> 38:03.913
Patrick is,

38:03.915 --> 38:07.884
How you would say... A badass.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.555
Sam...

38:12.557 --> 38:15.925
I have found love again.

38:15.927 --> 38:18.795
But this time, sam...

38:19.765 --> 38:22.432
...This time it is real.

38:31.943 --> 38:35.478
Do you know how tahir
got photos of my family?

38:37.082 --> 38:38.648
No.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.618
He only kept me alive
because he knew that one day

38:41.620 --> 38:43.920
This would draw you out.

38:43.922 --> 38:46.723
But he is obsessed
with you, sam.

38:46.725 --> 38:49.059
Tahir will stop at
nothing to kill you.

38:49.061 --> 38:52.329
Yeah, well, I won't have
to worry about that now.

38:52.331 --> 38:54.364
We've got him in custody.

38:54.366 --> 38:56.066
(sighs)

38:59.771 --> 39:01.771
(softly):
Good.

39:05.377 --> 39:08.845
If you ever need
anything from me,

39:08.847 --> 39:11.548
To protect you or...

39:13.385 --> 39:15.852
...Or your family...

39:17.856 --> 39:20.623
...Please let me
be there for you.

39:23.362 --> 39:24.994
As a very...

39:24.996 --> 39:27.764
Very good friend.

39:55.727 --> 39:56.726
You all right?

39:56.728 --> 39:58.762
Yeah.

40:00.465 --> 40:01.865
I'm good.

40:03.635 --> 40:05.802
Good.

40:05.804 --> 40:08.671
We got to get back
to the farm.

40:10.409 --> 40:12.475
Let's do it.

40:15.881 --> 40:18.648
(engine revs)

40:23.488 --> 40:25.488
So, I've analyzed and dated

40:25.490 --> 40:27.690
All the photos retrieved
from the tent in eritrea.

40:27.692 --> 40:31.127
These were taken
in December of 2015

40:31.129 --> 40:33.129
While aiden was home
for the holidays.

40:33.131 --> 40:35.565
That's one year
after we apprehended our mole,

40:35.567 --> 40:38.168
Carl brown.
There's a second mole,

40:38.170 --> 40:39.769
And he's still here.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.771
Son of a bitch.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.473
Granger:
Look into everyone who started

40:43.475 --> 40:45.608
Working here around
the same time as carl brown.

40:45.610 --> 40:46.910
But we've done that.

40:46.912 --> 40:48.178
Do it again.

40:48.180 --> 40:49.913
Granger: I want to know
everything about them.

40:49.915 --> 40:53.149
If they like ice cream,
I want to know the damn flavor.

40:56.755 --> 40:59.989
Until we find this mole,
it's open season

40:59.991 --> 41:02.492
On the lives of everyone
under this roof,

41:02.494 --> 41:05.161
Including you and me.

41:05.163 --> 41:07.564
I'll find him. Or her.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.532
I promise you.

41:09.534 --> 41:12.001
Just like you promised me
that the photos of jada

41:12.003 --> 41:14.871
Would never reach mr. Hanna.

41:14.873 --> 41:16.840
You...

41:16.842 --> 41:20.510
Sent them to the
embassy in juba.

41:20.512 --> 41:23.012
You know I'm a romantic.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.180
I know you lied to me,

41:24.182 --> 41:25.682
Owen.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.150
We've been lying to each other

41:27.152 --> 41:29.052
For a long time, henrietta.

41:36.027 --> 41:38.094
¶ ¶

41:48.640 --> 41:51.040
(grunts)

41:51.042 --> 41:52.809
(woman crying nearby)

41:52.811 --> 41:54.210
What happened?

41:54.212 --> 41:56.779
We were attacked
not long after you left.

41:56.781 --> 41:58.882
200 lra soldiers.

41:58.884 --> 42:00.216
I saw karume.

42:00.218 --> 42:02.085
I looked into his eyes.

42:02.087 --> 42:04.120
It was a setup.

42:04.122 --> 42:05.989
Karume was here the whole time.

42:05.991 --> 42:08.858
He was watching, waiting
for you and your men to arrive.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.093
They wanted
to finally take out the men

42:10.095 --> 42:11.661
Who have been hunting them
all these years.

42:11.663 --> 42:13.630
Sam:
Colonel...

42:13.632 --> 42:15.231
Where's tahir?

42:16.868 --> 42:19.102
Sorry. Karume's men took him

42:19.104 --> 42:20.737
During the attack.

42:20.739 --> 42:22.272
He's gone.

42:23.875 --> 42:27.143
I'll call hetty.
We'll make sure

42:27.145 --> 42:30.013
Michelle and the kids
are kept in protective custody.
