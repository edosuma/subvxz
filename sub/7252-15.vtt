WEBVTT

00:01.209 --> 00:02.210
Oh, sure. Thanks.

00:04.964 --> 00:06.882
[indistinct chatter]

00:14.222 --> 00:15.390
(Doyle)

00:14.222 --> 00:15.390
'Come in.'

00:16.684 --> 00:18.185
Hi, hello. I'm sorry.

00:18.226 --> 00:19.770
- Do I have the wrong room?

00:18.226 --> 00:19.770
- I wouldn't know.

00:19.812 --> 00:22.021
How delightful to have

00:19.812 --> 00:22.021
all of my towels used

00:22.063 --> 00:24.191
and then deposited

00:22.063 --> 00:24.191
in my hamper with my dry clothes

00:24.232 --> 00:26.109
to create a pungent,

00:24.232 --> 00:26.109
musty combo.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.528
- Hey, Lorelai.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.528
- Paris. Good.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.154
- I have the right room.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.154
- This is Rory's mother.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.281
Lorelai.

00:31.323 --> 00:32.658
I'm Doyle, Rory's editor.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.576
- And my lover.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.576
- Okay, well, super.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.912
I don't think "lover" is exactly

00:34.618 --> 00:36.912
the correct term, Paris.

00:36.954 --> 00:38.914
Really? What<i> is</i>

00:36.954 --> 00:38.914
the correct term, Doyle?

00:38.956 --> 00:40.457
At a later time, Paris.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.292
Doyle and I haven't

00:40.499 --> 00:42.292
defined the social aspects

00:42.334 --> 00:44.043
'of our relationship yet.'

00:44.085 --> 00:46.254
'Although, we're having sex

00:44.085 --> 00:46.254
three or four times a week'

00:46.296 --> 00:47.965
so apparently, the sexual

00:46.296 --> 00:47.965
aspects of the relationship

00:48.007 --> 00:49.299
are crystal freaking clear.

00:49.341 --> 00:51.050
- Paris, I beg you.

00:49.341 --> 00:51.050
- Is Rory here?

00:51.092 --> 00:53.178
- 'Cause I can wait outside or..

00:51.092 --> 00:53.178
- I'm making you uncomfortable?

00:53.220 --> 00:54.388
- Yes.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.388
- Her. Not you.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.097
No, I'm fine.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.097
You two should be alone.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.976
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't be

00:56.139 --> 00:58.976
talking about love or sex

00:59.018 --> 01:00.310
especially since you..

01:00.352 --> 01:01.812
- Since I..?

01:00.352 --> 01:01.812
- Don't have any.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.146
Rory, are you here?

01:03.188 --> 01:04.147
'Yeah, I'm just

01:03.188 --> 01:04.147
getting my coat.'

01:04.189 --> 01:05.816
Ah! Can I watch?

01:05.858 --> 01:07.359
- 'Uh, is Paris out there?'

01:05.858 --> 01:07.359
- She sure is.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.028
- 'Come on in.'

01:07.401 --> 01:09.028
- Nice meeting you, Doyle.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.529
Nice to meet you, too.

01:12.948 --> 01:14.282
Yes?

01:14.324 --> 01:16.076
You look so hot

01:14.324 --> 01:16.076
when you find me annoying.

01:16.117 --> 01:18.579
Then I must be Gisele Bundchen

01:16.117 --> 01:18.579
to you 24-7.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.583
Sorry. I thought she

01:20.455 --> 01:22.583
and Doyle were indisposed.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.626
Oh, no, plenty

01:22.624 --> 01:24.626
of disposal going on.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.962
So, I notice you

01:24.668 --> 01:26.962
told Paris about my breakup.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.672
I'm sorry. I didn't

01:27.004 --> 01:28.672
tell her on purpose.

01:28.714 --> 01:31.132
It's very difficult

01:28.714 --> 01:31.132
to keep anything from Paris.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.343
She's in very close proximity,

01:31.174 --> 01:33.343
and I swear she has dog ears.

01:33.385 --> 01:34.803
Yeah, that's fine.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.513
- Uh. I didn't mean to blab.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.513
- I know.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.306
But hey, don't worry about me.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.306
Things are starting to look up.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.683
They think I'm a student.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.226
And they also think

01:39.725 --> 01:41.226
you're Polynesian

01:41.268 --> 01:42.937
and potentially

01:41.268 --> 01:42.937
sexually undecided.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.145
Yeah. Well,

01:42.978 --> 01:44.145
still an improvement.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.480
Okay. Ready?

01:45.522 --> 01:46.565
This was a good idea,

01:45.522 --> 01:46.565
having dinner.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.608
Well, It is Friday night.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.734
Yeah, but Friday night dinner

01:48.776 --> 01:50.569
without Eva and Adolf. Lovely.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.529
It's really not fair

01:50.611 --> 01:52.529
calling grandpa Adolf.

01:52.571 --> 01:53.948
- No, no, that was grandma.

01:52.571 --> 01:53.948
- Okay.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.452
We're going.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.370
- Rory, are these your chips?

01:58.493 --> 02:00.370
- Yes, Doyle.

02:00.412 --> 02:02.205
- Can I have some?

02:00.412 --> 02:02.205
- Knock yourself out, Doyle.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.291
Listen, Lorelai,

02:02.247 --> 02:04.291
if you decide that your breakup

02:04.332 --> 02:05.626
is something that

02:04.332 --> 02:05.626
you want to talk about

02:05.667 --> 02:07.335
- please let me know.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.335
- Okay, Paris.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.630
And let me know before Tuesday

02:07.377 --> 02:09.630
'cause I'm doing a paper

02:09.671 --> 02:11.214
for my Emotional Mental Health

02:11.256 --> 02:12.841
of a certain age

cope with loneliness

'and I think you'd be

02:12.883 --> 02:15.761
a great lead-off antidote.'

02:15.803 --> 02:17.846
You can't take her.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.846
She's trained in Krav Maga.

do the cool kids sit?

03:17.698 --> 03:19.116
(Rory)

03:17.698 --> 03:19.116
This is Yale. There are no

03:17.698 --> 03:19.116
"cool kid" tables.

03:19.158 --> 03:21.076
Oh, come on.

03:19.158 --> 03:21.076
Point out the cliques.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.244
The geeks. The stoners.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.244
The Plastics.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.413
- Give me the scoop.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.413
- The scoop is, this is Yale.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.041
There are no cliques,

03:25.455 --> 03:27.041
we are beyond cliques.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.458
So you get to college, and..

03:28.500 --> 03:29.501
everybody just loves each other?

03:29.543 --> 03:30.919
Yes.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.211
It's Haight Ashbury

03:30.961 --> 03:32.211
all over again.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.421
Except the tie-dye's

03:32.253 --> 03:33.421
done by Prada.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.256
- Okay.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.256
- Hey, not that one.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.176
See? That was the clique table.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.635
No, it's under an air vent.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.138
Seriously, grandma,

03:38.677 --> 03:41.138
buy a shawl.

03:41.180 --> 03:44.766
Hey. One good cold can set you

03:41.180 --> 03:44.766
back a month in studying.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.268
Hmm, see, in my mind,

03:44.808 --> 03:47.268
I heard partying, but okay.

03:47.310 --> 03:50.105
Here's to our very own special

03:47.310 --> 03:50.105
Friday night dinner.

03:50.147 --> 03:51.940
Hear, hear.

03:50.147 --> 03:51.940
This stuff looks pretty good.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.151
It is.

03:51.982 --> 03:54.151
So, what's going on at home?

03:54.193 --> 03:56.904
[gasps]

03:54.193 --> 03:56.904
Big grapefruit shortage.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.488
The hurricanes wiped 'em out

03:58.530 --> 03:59.614
and Taylor is

03:58.530 --> 03:59.614
completely freaking out.

03:59.656 --> 04:00.949
I'm sure.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.534
And Patty and Babette

04:00.991 --> 04:02.534
are organizing

04:02.576 --> 04:04.494
Stars Hollow's first

04:02.576 --> 04:04.494
botox party.

04:04.536 --> 04:05.662
Are you invited?

04:05.704 --> 04:07.039
Are you insinuating I should be?

04:07.081 --> 04:08.165
So, the Hollow's low

04:07.081 --> 04:08.165
on grapefruits?

04:08.207 --> 04:09.666
Uh-huh.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.376
And I'm doing costumes

04:09.708 --> 04:11.376
for the Star's Hollow

04:11.418 --> 04:13.461
Elementary School production

04:11.418 --> 04:13.461
of "Fiddler on the Roof."

04:13.503 --> 04:15.380
So, how are<i> you</i> doing?

04:15.422 --> 04:17.674
[chuckles]

04:15.422 --> 04:17.674
I'm doing fine.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.300
How are you doing?

04:19.342 --> 04:22.054
I am doing fine, I swear.

04:19.342 --> 04:22.054
I'm getting better.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.014
No word from Luke?

04:24.056 --> 04:26.600
- Not waiting on word from Luke.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.600
- Okay.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.560
Anyhow, I'm fine, I mean

04:28.602 --> 04:30.938
not that I'm over it,

04:28.602 --> 04:30.938
but little by little

04:30.979 --> 04:33.607
it's getting easier

04:30.979 --> 04:33.607
to pretend it's easier

04:33.648 --> 04:35.234
which means easier must be

04:33.648 --> 04:35.234
right around the corner.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.777
I'm sure it is.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.862
And I'm working on getting

04:36.818 --> 04:38.862
down a new routine.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.864
I've settled on Weston's

04:38.904 --> 04:40.864
in the morning.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.532
Decent coffee,

04:40.906 --> 04:42.532
excellent strudel.

04:42.574 --> 04:45.368
Yeah. So that's me,

04:42.574 --> 04:45.368
how are you?

04:45.410 --> 04:47.829
Well, I study, then study

04:47.871 --> 04:49.664
then, after a little

04:47.871 --> 04:49.664
study break, I study.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.333
Uh-huh.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.333
How's, um, Logan?

04:52.375 --> 04:55.003
He's been out of town for a

04:52.375 --> 04:55.003
while, so I haven't seen him.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.046
And what else?

04:56.755 --> 04:57.965
Mmm..

04:59.007 --> 04:59.758
What?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.342
I got an e-mail from dad.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.928
[inhales sharply]

05:02.970 --> 05:04.138
Oh, you did?

05:04.179 --> 05:05.555
Huh. When?

05:05.597 --> 05:07.057
Monday.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.434
Only two weeks after

05:07.099 --> 05:09.434
the fact. Very speedy.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.019
I'm sure he was just nervous.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.021
You don't, you don't need

05:11.061 --> 05:13.021
to hide that from me.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.439
Well, I wasn't sure

05:13.063 --> 05:14.439
if you wanted to hear

05:14.481 --> 05:16.108
about it or hear dad's name.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.859
It's part of the whole

05:16.150 --> 05:17.859
moving on thing right?

05:17.901 --> 05:19.319
So what did he say?

05:19.360 --> 05:20.904
He wanted to give me

05:19.360 --> 05:20.904
his side of the story.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.824
Oh, well, unless his side

05:20.946 --> 05:23.824
of the story includes

05:23.865 --> 05:26.660
having his long-lost

05:23.865 --> 05:26.660
evil twin lock him in the closet

05:26.701 --> 05:28.287
and come

05:26.701 --> 05:28.287
to the wedding in his place

05:28.328 --> 05:29.704
his side of the story

05:28.328 --> 05:29.704
doesn't exist.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.081
He said it was all

05:29.746 --> 05:31.081
a misunderstanding.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.332
- What?

05:31.123 --> 05:32.332
- 'He said..'

05:32.373 --> 05:33.750
The only reason

05:32.373 --> 05:33.750
he came was to celebrate

05:33.792 --> 05:35.002
grandma

05:33.792 --> 05:35.002
and grandpa's vow renewal.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.628
And 'cause Adolf told him to.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.047
- He says he likes Luke.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.047
- Yeah. He's proven that.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.175
- He just wants you to be happy.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.175
- So he got me dumped.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.676
And basically that

05:41.216 --> 05:42.676
the whole thing

05:42.717 --> 05:44.011
was just a misunderstanding.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.637
You know, the more

05:44.052 --> 05:45.637
he defends himself

05:45.679 --> 05:47.472
the more he needs

05:45.679 --> 05:47.472
to defend himself.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.516
Hey. Do you think

05:47.514 --> 05:49.516
grandpa knew about it?

05:49.557 --> 05:50.934
About Christopher coming?

05:50.976 --> 05:52.686
Do you think he planned

05:50.976 --> 05:52.686
it with grandma?

05:52.727 --> 05:54.437
Look how panicked you are.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.437
No, honey.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.398
Honestly, the whole thing

05:54.479 --> 05:57.398
reeks of Emily.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.651
'I mean, not that I think

05:57.440 --> 05:59.651
he would have discouraged it'

05:59.693 --> 06:02.654
but I'm pretty sure she's

05:59.693 --> 06:02.654
the one who poisoned the apple

06:02.696 --> 06:04.614
and gave it to Dopey

06:02.696 --> 06:04.614
to bring to the party.

06:04.656 --> 06:05.907
Yeah.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.450
- Oh, my God.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.450
- Never again.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.910
Never, never again.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.747
See? We<i> are</i>

06:10.537 --> 06:12.747
at the cool table.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.334
I'm telling you, if she

06:12.789 --> 06:15.334
throws up, you're golden.

06:15.374 --> 06:17.252
You are so not starving

06:15.374 --> 06:17.252
here at Yale.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.754
- My lips are frozen.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.754
- Look.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.298
While it might seem

06:19.796 --> 06:21.298
a little eccentric

06:21.340 --> 06:22.841
to eat ice-cream

06:21.340 --> 06:22.841
in 40-degree weather..

06:22.883 --> 06:24.383
You think?

06:24.425 --> 06:26.178
...there are several

06:24.425 --> 06:26.178
advantages to the concept.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.222
For example, since it's cold

06:26.220 --> 06:28.222
out, the ice-cream won't melt.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.015
Therefore,

06:28.263 --> 06:30.015
it'll last longer.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.142
So then my lips will stay frozen

06:30.057 --> 06:32.142
for double the amount of time.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.476
Mm-hmm.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.145
Hey, I lost the feeling

06:33.518 --> 06:35.145
in my tongue.

06:35.187 --> 06:36.730
I'm throwing

06:35.187 --> 06:36.730
the ice-cream out now.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.815
Oh, my God. It's frozen.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.815
It's like an ice cube.

06:38.857 --> 06:41.400
It's like a tongue-shaped

06:38.857 --> 06:41.400
ice cube. And it'll never thaw.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.777
Then why don't you

06:41.442 --> 06:42.777
shut your mouth

06:42.819 --> 06:44.321
and let the heat

06:42.819 --> 06:44.321
stay inside?

06:44.363 --> 06:46.573
That was hostile.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.949
And useful.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.949
Thank you.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.659
Hey, isn't that

06:47.991 --> 06:49.659
your naked guy?

06:49.701 --> 06:51.452
Oh, Yeah.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.452
Marty, hey.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.080
He's not<i> my</i> naked guy.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.332
Wait. You don't want

06:53.121 --> 06:55.332
a communal naked guy nowadays.

06:55.374 --> 06:57.167
You know, it's too sketchy.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.128
Huh.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.504
Well, I guess he

07:00.170 --> 07:01.504
didn't hear about you

07:01.546 --> 07:02.589
sittin' at the cool table.

07:02.630 --> 07:03.631
Yeah.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.050
You guys rumbling?

07:05.092 --> 07:07.094
No, we're just

07:05.092 --> 07:07.094
not as close lately.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.803
Aw, that's too bad.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.803
He seems like a nice guy.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.264
Yeah. He is.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.515
Alright, honey,

07:10.305 --> 07:12.515
thank you for dinner.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.851
- You're leaving?

07:12.557 --> 07:14.851
- Yeah, I should get back.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.437
Okay. You can come in and watch

07:14.893 --> 07:17.437
TV for a while if you want.

07:17.478 --> 07:18.521
Ah, it's okay.

07:18.563 --> 07:19.689
You can even stay over

07:19.731 --> 07:21.108
if you don't feel

07:19.731 --> 07:21.108
like driving back.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.609
Are there monsters

07:21.149 --> 07:22.609
under your bed again?

07:22.650 --> 07:24.861
- I'm just saying.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.861
- Look, Miss Nightingale.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.280
I appreciate your concern

07:26.321 --> 07:28.865
and the offer

07:26.321 --> 07:28.865
to spend the night is much nicer

07:28.907 --> 07:31.159
than the suggestion that

07:28.907 --> 07:31.159
I shut my mouth, but I'm fine.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.452
You sure?

07:32.493 --> 07:34.413
- Big girl.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.413
- Yeah. It's still new.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.539
Angel, I have

07:34.454 --> 07:36.539
been dumped before.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.833
- Not by Luke.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.833
- No, not by Luke.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.044
But a dump is a dump.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.670
The process

07:41.086 --> 07:42.670
is still the same.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.464
- Don't worry. Mom's cool.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.464
- Oh, I know mom's cool.

07:44.505 --> 07:45.590
'Cause you heard

07:44.505 --> 07:45.590
about the table?

07:45.632 --> 07:47.050
- Exactly.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.050
- Alright, kid.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.551
- I'll see you later.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.551
- Okay, bye.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.601
Wow. Looks good.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.271
Hey, I'm Lorelai.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.271
I'll be here every morning.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.855
Okay, see you guys tomorrow.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.984
Here we go.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.984
Three coffees.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.902
Oh, I'm no.. I'm sorry.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.902
I only ordered one.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.821
You said,

08:05.944 --> 08:07.821
"Coffee, coffee, coffee."

08:07.862 --> 08:09.530
No, see, I said..

08:09.572 --> 08:11.199
- "Coffee-coffee-coffee."

08:09.572 --> 08:11.199
- Right.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.493
As in, I really need

08:11.241 --> 08:13.493
"Coffee-coffee-coffee."

08:13.534 --> 08:15.120
- You know?

08:13.534 --> 08:15.120
- No.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.831
"Coffee-coffee-coffee" is

08:15.162 --> 08:17.831
a saying, like an exaggeration.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.708
It's a funny,

08:17.872 --> 08:20.708
desperate cry for caffeine.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.210
It's just my thing.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.795
'Cause everybody knows

08:22.252 --> 08:23.795
I drink a lot of coffee

08:23.837 --> 08:25.588
so the day can't start

08:23.837 --> 08:25.588
until I've had my jolt.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.467
It's a bit. My bit.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.969
It's not a particularly funny

08:28.508 --> 08:30.969
bit unless you know me. Then..

08:31.011 --> 08:32.720
You know what?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.720
Three coffees would be great.

08:32.762 --> 08:33.638
What do I owe you?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.573
I don't know what other words

08:50.530 --> 08:52.573
I should use.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.117
Perhaps I should talk slower

08:54.159 --> 08:56.286
or have a woman sit

08:54.159 --> 08:56.286
in a circle above my head

08:56.328 --> 08:57.662
signing my words to you.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.039
That would be fresher

08:57.704 --> 08:59.039
than you yelling at us.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.665
- Glenn.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.665
- Sorry.

09:00.707 --> 09:04.002
But everytime I hear you,

09:00.707 --> 09:04.002
I hear my mother, see my mother.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.170
Stop comparing me

09:04.044 --> 09:05.170
to your mother.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.296
Stop acting like her.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.881
Anyhow, as I was saying--

09:07.922 --> 09:09.090
"Pick up your socks!"

09:09.132 --> 09:10.550
Hey! Our editor's talking.

09:10.591 --> 09:11.759
He's your boyfriend. Not mine.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.345
That has yet

09:11.801 --> 09:13.345
to be determined.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.721
You're feeling particularly

09:13.387 --> 09:14.721
sassy today.

09:14.762 --> 09:16.806
I know. It must be

09:14.762 --> 09:16.806
my new glasses prescription.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.683
I need all of you to hand in

09:16.848 --> 09:18.683
a hard copy of your stories

09:18.725 --> 09:20.768
in addition to filing them

09:18.725 --> 09:20.768
electronically.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.187
Last week, our

09:20.810 --> 09:22.187
mail server was down

09:22.229 --> 09:23.438
and we very nearly

09:22.229 --> 09:23.438
missed our deadline.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.481
Now, how would that have looked?

09:24.523 --> 09:25.732
- Blank.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.732
- Glenn!

09:25.773 --> 09:26.941
Sorry. Mum.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.194
'New system starts today.'

09:29.236 --> 09:32.155
I want all articles

09:29.236 --> 09:32.155
in hard copy on my desk..

09:32.197 --> 09:34.449
- Where are you going?

09:32.197 --> 09:34.449
- I'll be right back.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.659
- I'm talking.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.659
- And very well, might I add.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.370
- Gilmore?

09:36.701 --> 09:38.370
- Doyle, I could be back by now.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.375
Well, that's a manly sized

09:41.456 --> 09:43.375
cup of coffee.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.504
Yeah, I, uh,

09:44.625 --> 09:47.504
I worked late

09:47.546 --> 09:50.215
and I had a paper,

09:47.546 --> 09:50.215
and I didn't get a lot of sleep.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.758
Marty, you never

09:50.257 --> 09:51.758
have to apologize

09:51.799 --> 09:53.093
for a huge cup of coffee to me.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.511
Right. I know.

09:54.553 --> 09:55.887
So, you've been

09:54.553 --> 09:55.887
pretty busy lately, huh?

09:55.929 --> 09:56.930
Uh, yes.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.014
- Working a lot?

09:56.971 --> 09:58.014
- Yes.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.849
- Studying a lot?

09:58.056 --> 09:59.849
- Yes.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.226
So that's probably why

09:59.891 --> 10:01.226
I haven't seen you very much.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.853
- Yes. Probably.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.853
- I missed you. A lot.

10:03.895 --> 10:06.731
Well, I'm sure you've been

10:03.895 --> 10:06.731
a little busy yourself.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.608
I guess.

10:08.649 --> 10:10.110
Hey, listen. Are you

10:08.649 --> 10:10.110
working this weekend?

10:10.151 --> 10:11.652
- Uh, no.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.652
- Great.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.696
Because I was thinking

10:11.694 --> 10:13.696
it's been ages

10:13.738 --> 10:15.031
since we've had

10:13.738 --> 10:15.031
a good hangout night.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.825
- Oh. Well..

10:15.073 --> 10:17.825
- We could watch DVDs.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.619
Oh, I just got the new

10:17.867 --> 10:19.619
Marx Brothers box set.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.371
You love the Marx Brothers,

10:19.660 --> 10:21.371
Duck Soup!

10:21.413 --> 10:22.830
- I don't know if I can--

10:21.413 --> 10:22.830
- Did you hear me?

10:22.872 --> 10:24.207
I just said Duck Soup.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.542
- Rory..

10:24.249 --> 10:25.542
- We could watch them all.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.127
You know, start early.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.170
Make a major marathon thing

10:27.168 --> 10:29.170
out of it. Just us.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.880
We haven't done this

10:29.212 --> 10:30.880
in a long time. Please?

10:32.466 --> 10:34.259
Okay. Sounds good.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.344
Really?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.344
Oh, great.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.597
Okay, so, on Saturday, 3-ish?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.515
- 3-ish it is.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.515
- Excellent. Really. Okay.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.683
I have to get back, and you

10:40.557 --> 10:42.683
have a lot of coffee to drink.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.769
- So I'll see you Saturday.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.769
- See you Saturday.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.104
Okay!

10:52.235 --> 10:54.154
Hey, Luke, great boat

10:52.235 --> 10:54.154
you got out there.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.822
Oh, yeah, thanks, Andrew.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.533
Are you selling it, or is it

10:55.863 --> 10:58.533
some kind of seafood promotion?

10:58.575 --> 11:01.369
I don't wanna

10:58.575 --> 11:01.369
to talk about it!

11:01.411 --> 11:04.205
Good thing you parked it

11:01.411 --> 11:04.205
right outside the diner then.

11:04.247 --> 11:05.499
What?

11:05.540 --> 11:07.375
[coughs]

11:05.540 --> 11:07.375
Nothing. Nothing.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.089
Go on.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.089
He's right over there.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.886
Geez, kid!

11:16.384 --> 11:18.886
Don't just stand there.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.763
You'll give me

11:18.928 --> 11:20.763
a heart attack.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.646
Hey.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.856
- Mr. Danes?

11:27.686 --> 11:29.856
- Yeah, speak up there, kid.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.024
We got a bit of a height

11:29.897 --> 11:31.024
difference here.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.900
I need to ask

11:31.065 --> 11:32.900
you something.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.777
Bathrooms are in the back.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.777
They're for customers only.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.530
So, you have to order something.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.530
You wanna order something?

11:36.571 --> 11:39.032
You want to use the bathroom?

11:36.571 --> 11:39.032
Well, what do you want?

11:41.075 --> 11:42.701
What are you doing?

11:41.075 --> 11:42.701
What's he doing?

11:42.743 --> 11:44.663
Don't worry. This always

11:42.743 --> 11:44.663
happens when he's terrified.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.206
What the hell

11:44.703 --> 11:46.206
is he terrified of?

11:46.247 --> 11:48.375
Bradley, would you like me

11:46.247 --> 11:48.375
to tell him for you?

11:48.416 --> 11:49.834
Okay. Luke..

11:49.876 --> 11:51.378
Why is he doing that?

11:51.419 --> 11:52.920
- Oh, he's fine.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.920
- He doesn't look fine.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.131
Luke. Luke.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.131
Eyes on me.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.924
'Eyes on me. Thank you.'

11:56.966 --> 11:58.801
Now, as you know,

11:56.966 --> 11:58.801
teach third grade

11:58.843 --> 12:00.679
over at the elementary school

12:00.719 --> 12:03.390
and our production of "Fiddler

12:00.719 --> 12:03.390
on the Roof" is on Saturday.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.643
And Bradley here is in charge

12:03.431 --> 12:06.643
of set design. Right, Bradley?

12:06.685 --> 12:09.020
So he just wanted

12:06.685 --> 12:09.020
to come here and tell you

12:09.062 --> 12:11.398
that he will need you at the

12:09.062 --> 12:11.398
school tomorrow at 3 o'clock.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.358
'And, please, bring

12:11.439 --> 12:13.358
your own tools, okay?'

12:13.400 --> 12:14.693
You did that very well, Bradley.

12:14.733 --> 12:15.985
What are you talking about?

12:16.027 --> 12:17.654
I thought Bradley

12:16.027 --> 12:17.654
was very clear.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.113
What do you mean he needs me

12:17.696 --> 12:19.113
at the school tomorrow?

12:19.155 --> 12:20.490
He needs me at

12:19.155 --> 12:20.490
the school to do what?

12:20.532 --> 12:22.367
To help build the sets.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.702
I'm not gonna help

12:22.409 --> 12:23.702
build any sets.

12:23.742 --> 12:25.036
- But--

12:23.742 --> 12:25.036
- I have a diner to run.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.538
I don't have time

12:25.078 --> 12:26.538
to build any sets.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.582
But Lorelai

12:26.580 --> 12:28.582
signed you up weeks ago.

12:28.623 --> 12:29.916
- She did?

12:28.623 --> 12:29.916
- Yes. She did.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.501
She signed you up

12:29.957 --> 12:31.501
to build the sets

12:31.543 --> 12:33.169
and she signed herself up

12:31.543 --> 12:33.169
to make the costumes.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.213
Oh, I must have

12:33.211 --> 12:35.213
forgot about that.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.716
Yeah. I know you two

12:35.255 --> 12:37.716
are having a little trouble.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.259
I mean, I saw the boat.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.510
But I figured

12:39.300 --> 12:40.510
since it was for the kids

12:40.552 --> 12:41.802
you'd still

12:40.552 --> 12:41.802
be willing to help.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.096
Lorelai still

12:41.844 --> 12:43.096
making the costumes?

12:43.137 --> 12:44.723
'Oh. Of course she is.'

12:44.763 --> 12:47.475
A lot of the parents

12:44.763 --> 12:47.475
are helping out with costumes

12:47.517 --> 12:49.143
makeup, lighting, programs.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.853
But you've

12:49.185 --> 12:50.853
spoken to her recently

12:50.895 --> 12:52.855
and she's going to be there,

12:50.895 --> 12:52.855
making the costumes?

12:52.897 --> 12:54.691
Look, Luke, if it's gonna

12:52.897 --> 12:54.691
be too hard for you

12:54.733 --> 12:57.151
to be in the same space

12:54.733 --> 12:57.151
as Lorelai, I totally--

12:57.193 --> 12:58.194
No, it's fine.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.194
I'll be there.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.613
- You sure?

12:58.236 --> 12:59.613
- Yeah.

12:59.654 --> 13:00.655
I mean, if other people

12:59.654 --> 13:00.655
are gonna be helping out

13:00.697 --> 13:02.115
I might as well.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.617
You know, it's for the kids.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.868
So, I'll see you tomorrow

13:03.658 --> 13:05.868
at 3, right?

13:05.910 --> 13:08.037
- With your tools.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.037
- With my tools.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.582
That's great. Thank you, Luke.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.582
The kids will be thrilled.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.166
Well, that's what

13:10.624 --> 13:12.166
matters, right?

13:12.208 --> 13:13.543
Let's go, Bradley.

13:13.585 --> 13:14.961
I hope he's not late.

13:15.002 --> 13:16.254
Oh, I hope so, too.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.135
No more pork!

13:22.176 --> 13:23.928
Finally, something to put

13:22.176 --> 13:23.928
on our business cards.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.888
I'm tired of it, I am out

13:23.970 --> 13:25.888
of interesting ways to serve it

13:25.930 --> 13:27.515
and I'm not buying it anymore.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.643
I want another other white meat.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.478
Mugsy raised the price

13:29.684 --> 13:31.478
on you again, huh?

13:31.519 --> 13:32.979
That pig-hoarding bastard.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.356
Well, cut it out for a month.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.356
I bet he comes around.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.525
I guess. Ooh,

13:35.398 --> 13:37.525
what's in the bag?

13:37.567 --> 13:41.613
- And that is..?

13:37.567 --> 13:41.613
- A bag of Santa beards.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.281
Naturally.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.824
I need 25 dark beards

13:43.323 --> 13:45.824
for "Fiddler on the Roof."

13:45.866 --> 13:48.662
I drove to four different towns

13:45.866 --> 13:48.662
and six different costume shops

13:48.703 --> 13:50.246
and this was

13:48.703 --> 13:50.246
all I could find.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.666
Apparently, Lieberman's

13:50.288 --> 13:52.666
the only Jew in Connecticut.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.125
- Hey, can I borrow some tea?

13:52.707 --> 13:54.125
- Why?

13:54.167 --> 13:55.669
I thought I'd use

13:54.167 --> 13:55.669
it to dye them.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.128
Very clever.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.128
Up on the shelf.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.463
Thanks.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.423
So, other than

13:58.505 --> 14:00.423
the great beard search

14:00.465 --> 14:01.508
how was your morning?

14:01.549 --> 14:03.593
- Fine.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.593
- Yeah? Good.

14:03.635 --> 14:06.304
So, what route did you

14:03.635 --> 14:06.304
take to work today?

14:06.346 --> 14:07.764
Oh, the usual, you know.

14:07.806 --> 14:10.308
Main street to Oak

14:07.806 --> 14:10.308
and then a sharp starboard turn

14:10.350 --> 14:12.519
at the marina and four

14:10.350 --> 14:12.519
nautical miles to the Inn.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.103
- You saw it?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.103
- Oh, yeah.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.147
I saw the back of the boat

14:14.145 --> 14:16.147
driving from Weston's.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.774
I saw the front of the boat

14:16.189 --> 14:17.774
from the bank.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.066
And then I went upstairs

14:17.816 --> 14:19.066
to the post office

14:19.108 --> 14:20.735
and I got a nice

14:19.108 --> 14:20.735
aerial shot of the boat.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.696
Basically, I took the

14:20.777 --> 14:22.696
White House tour of the boat.

14:22.737 --> 14:25.239
I can't believe Luke did this.

14:22.737 --> 14:25.239
I mean, what was he thinking?

14:25.281 --> 14:27.701
- I don't know.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.701
- When did he come get it?

14:27.742 --> 14:30.244
Beats me. I didn't notice it

14:27.742 --> 14:30.244
gone when I left this morning.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.746
Did he tell you

14:30.286 --> 14:31.746
he was gonna take it?

14:31.788 --> 14:33.832
- Nope.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.832
- Well, I think that stinks.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.709
He's a jerk for pulling

14:33.873 --> 14:35.709
something like that.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.084
It's his boat. He can do

14:35.750 --> 14:37.084
what he wants with it.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.086
Not if it's something

14:37.126 --> 14:39.086
mean. He can't.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.255
Well, I caused the situation

14:39.128 --> 14:41.255
in the first place.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.132
I bought the boat.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.132
I put it in my garage.

14:43.174 --> 14:44.634
I know, but he

14:43.174 --> 14:44.634
broke your heart

14:44.676 --> 14:45.719
and now he's

14:44.676 --> 14:45.719
rubbing your face in it.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.011
Jesus. I'm pathetic.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.680
I know.

14:48.722 --> 14:52.266
Look, Sookie, please. You

14:48.722 --> 14:52.266
don't have to be mad at Luke.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.518
Okay? You don't have

14:52.308 --> 14:53.518
to hate him.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.311
No. I don't mind hating him.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.646
I appreciate that,

14:55.353 --> 14:56.646
but I don't really wanna

14:56.688 --> 14:57.938
talk about it anymore.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.149
Where are you going?

14:57.980 --> 15:00.149
Did I drive you out?

15:00.191 --> 15:01.860
I'm sorry. I, I'll stop

15:00.191 --> 15:01.860
talking about it.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.028
No, it's fine, I'm fine.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.028
I've.. I have stuff to do.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.364
I have costumes to make

15:04.070 --> 15:06.364
and beards to convert.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.907
So, I'll see you later.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.450
Okay.

Hey, Luke.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.576
We are so glad to see you.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.369
You're ten minutes late.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.622
Yeah, sorry about that.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.622
But hey, I brought my tools.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.081
Great.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.081
Well, this is Damon.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.165
Hey, there, Damon.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.250
My mother's a lesbian.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.001
Oh.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.462
I brought my tools.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.255
And you remember

16:02.503 --> 16:04.255
your supervisor Bradley.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.549
Yeah, Bradley.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.549
Nice to see you again, Bradley.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.259
Well, you boys

16:06.591 --> 16:08.259
should get started.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.970
I'll be right over here

16:08.301 --> 16:10.970
if you need my help. Have fun.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.346
So, where do we

16:11.011 --> 16:12.346
get started, men?

16:12.388 --> 16:14.014
First, we have

16:12.388 --> 16:14.014
to build Tevye's house.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.391
Okay. We can do that.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.684
There's plans

16:15.433 --> 16:16.684
for the house over here.

16:16.726 --> 16:17.769
Uh, yeah, show me the plans.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.355
Do you know any lesbians?

16:21.397 --> 16:23.149
Uh...I'm sure I do.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.859
How many?

16:24.901 --> 16:25.902
Three, maybe four.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.194
<i>Maybe</i> four?

16:27.236 --> 16:29.322
Well, I'm waiting

16:27.236 --> 16:29.322
on confirmation.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.406
I like lesbians.

16:30.448 --> 16:31.991
Yeah, they're swell.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.785
- Here are the plans.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.785
- Okay.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.870
Let's see

16:33.827 --> 16:35.870
what we got.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.414
Uh, alright.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.414
Looks pretty simple.

16:38.456 --> 16:39.499
Looks like the boards

16:38.456 --> 16:39.499
are already cut.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.041
Okay, let's get started.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.377
Uh, everyone grab

16:41.083 --> 16:43.377
a Philips-head screwdriver.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.925
Okay, once you have

16:46.965 --> 16:48.925
your screwdriver..

16:48.967 --> 16:50.885
What are you holding?

16:48.967 --> 16:50.885
Bradley, that's a hammer.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.345
It is?

16:52.386 --> 16:53.888
- 'Damon, that's tape.'

16:52.386 --> 16:53.888
- Oh.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.348
I can't believe this,

16:53.930 --> 16:55.348
no one ever taught you

16:55.389 --> 16:56.975
what a Philips-head

16:55.389 --> 16:56.975
screwdriver is?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.309
My mother's a lesbian.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.895
Uh-huh. Okay, come here.

17:00.937 --> 17:04.148
See, this is

17:00.937 --> 17:04.148
a Philips-head screwdriver

17:04.190 --> 17:08.068
and this is

17:04.190 --> 17:08.068
a flathead screwdriver.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.112
Uh, see, 'cause it's got a..

17:10.154 --> 17:12.365
- Flat head.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.365
- Yes, exactly, now.

17:12.406 --> 17:15.117
We need

17:12.406 --> 17:15.117
a Philips-head screwdriver.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.705
So go ahead and find that,

17:15.159 --> 17:18.705
and we'll get started, okay?

17:18.746 --> 17:20.915
Hurry up. We get done by 5,

17:18.746 --> 17:20.915
beers are on me.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.291
Well, well, well.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.794
Look who Santa

17:22.333 --> 17:24.794
stuffed in my stocking.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.379
Yeah, Carrie.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.379
What a surprise.

17:26.420 --> 17:30.174
Isn't life a scream?

17:26.420 --> 17:30.174
My God, you look fantastic.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.011
Breakups agree with Luke Danes.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.011
Give me a hug.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.304
Easy, there.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.304
Kids are here.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.765
So, uh, how are you?

17:37.807 --> 17:41.019
I heard all about it. I tell you

17:37.807 --> 17:41.019
that Lorelai is out of her mind.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.854
I mean, that's apparent

17:41.060 --> 17:42.854
from the outfits alone

17:42.896 --> 17:45.356
but to let one of the last

17:42.896 --> 17:45.356
real He-Men go free

17:45.398 --> 17:47.107
she should

17:45.398 --> 17:47.107
up that dosage, baby.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.484
Carrie, what are

17:47.149 --> 17:48.484
you doing here?

17:48.526 --> 17:50.028
I'm the director.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.028
Isn't that fabulous?

17:50.069 --> 17:52.030
- Jenny got me into it.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.030
- Jenny's your..

17:52.071 --> 17:53.698
My youngest.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.698
She's 7.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.158
And God help her, the spitting

17:53.740 --> 17:56.158
image of her father.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.660
- Yeah, where is she?

17:56.200 --> 17:57.660
- Oh.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.328
She's hiding under

17:57.702 --> 17:59.328
a chair somewhere.

17:59.370 --> 18:02.122
She's so odd, that girl.

17:59.370 --> 18:02.122
She's always hiding from me.

18:02.164 --> 18:05.376
Yeah, crazy. I gotta, I got

18:02.164 --> 18:05.376
to build Tevye's house here so..

18:05.418 --> 18:07.003
I have to get

18:05.418 --> 18:07.003
rehearsal started anyway.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.087
Yeah.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.129
It's good to see you, Luke.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.423
We'll have to catch up later.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.967
Yeah, sure.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.967
We sure will, Carrie.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.428
Uh...yeah.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.138
Don't you<i> ever</i> leave me

18:15.469 --> 18:18.138
alone with her again.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.933
Okay, kids.

18:19.974 --> 18:22.936
I need my cast right here

18:19.974 --> 18:22.936
in the middle of the stage.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.312
Everybody,

18:22.977 --> 18:25.312
let's gather right here.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.981
Hey, Luke,

18:25.354 --> 18:26.981
you're helping out here?

18:27.023 --> 18:28.566
Oh, yeah, sets.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.566
How about you?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.359
- I'm playing Tevye.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.359
- You're..?

18:30.401 --> 18:31.694
Come on, kids.

18:30.401 --> 18:31.694
Chop chop.

18:31.736 --> 18:33.988
Excuse me,

18:31.736 --> 18:33.988
my director's calling.

18:34.030 --> 18:37.075
Okay, now,

18:34.030 --> 18:37.075
before we start rehearsal

18:37.116 --> 18:39.285
I just want to ask,

18:37.116 --> 18:39.285
has anybody seen Jenny?

18:39.326 --> 18:40.828
Okay, never mind.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.039
Now, I need to remind you

18:40.870 --> 18:43.039
that I need to know

18:43.081 --> 18:46.166
whose mommies and daddies are

18:43.081 --> 18:46.166
going to be coming to the show.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.461
Yes, Damon, I know

18:46.208 --> 18:48.461
your mommy's a lesbian

18:48.502 --> 18:49.837
but is she coming to the show?

18:49.879 --> 18:51.297
Okay, great.

18:51.338 --> 18:52.381
And everyone else,

18:51.338 --> 18:52.381
I need to know

18:52.423 --> 18:53.800
so I can issue your tickets.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.509
'Yes, Kirk.'

18:55.551 --> 18:56.761
My mother's

18:55.551 --> 18:56.761
going to be in Florida.

18:56.803 --> 18:57.804
Okay, fine.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.388
Everybody else

18:59.430 --> 19:01.724
tell me or Miss Kushner

18:59.430 --> 19:01.724
by the end of the day.

19:01.766 --> 19:04.226
Now, before we start,

19:01.766 --> 19:04.226
does anybody have to go potty?

19:06.353 --> 19:10.024
Well, go now and go fast.

19:06.353 --> 19:10.024
We have a lot of work to do.

19:10.066 --> 19:13.027
I'll just be two minutes

19:10.066 --> 19:13.027
and then it's L'Chaim to Life.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.655
- Hey, Lulu.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.655
- Yes.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.197
Yeah, I was just wondering.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.992
Where are all

19:17.239 --> 19:18.992
the other tall people?

19:19.033 --> 19:20.660
- Excuse me?

19:19.033 --> 19:20.660
- You know.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.036
Other people to help

19:20.701 --> 19:22.036
out with the lighting

19:22.078 --> 19:23.663
the makeup, the costumes!

19:23.704 --> 19:26.373
Oh, they'll be here. They all

19:23.704 --> 19:26.373
come in at different times.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.875
Okay, I was just asking.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.875
No biggie.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.045
I'm here. I'm done.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.045
I flushed.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.797
Good boy, Kirk.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.299
Okay, everyone take your places

19:32.839 --> 19:35.299
for the top of the show!

19:35.341 --> 19:36.968
What is Kirk

19:35.341 --> 19:36.968
doing in the play?

19:37.010 --> 19:39.386
Oh. We couldn't find a boy

19:37.010 --> 19:39.386
who could handle the part.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.139
But it's an

19:39.428 --> 19:41.139
elementary school play.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.556
How hard could the part be?

19:42.598 --> 19:45.143
- Tevye's a very demanding role.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.143
- But..

19:45.184 --> 19:46.185
We looked and looked.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.645
We even opened up

19:46.226 --> 19:47.645
auditions

19:47.687 --> 19:49.939
to the scary extension school

19:47.687 --> 19:49.939
kids, but nothing.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.816
And you know, we had

19:49.981 --> 19:51.816
a terrible experiences

19:51.858 --> 19:53.151
last year when we did

19:51.858 --> 19:53.151
"Jesus Christ Superstar."

19:53.192 --> 19:54.902
Oh, yeah.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.237
Jesus was allergic to peanuts,

19:54.944 --> 19:57.237
and stuff went up his nose

19:57.279 --> 19:59.699
and broke out in terrible hives

19:57.279 --> 19:59.699
during intermission.

19:59.740 --> 20:03.285
The second act was all Judas and

19:59.740 --> 20:03.285
Pontius Pilate. Pure disaster.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.329
We had to refund money.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.329
It was a nightmare.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.040
So this year,

20:05.371 --> 20:07.040
we went with a ringer.

20:07.081 --> 20:09.834
A fiddler on the roof?

20:09.876 --> 20:11.961
Sounds crazy, no?

20:12.003 --> 20:13.671
- Oh, boy, does it.

20:12.003 --> 20:13.671
- But..

20:13.713 --> 20:15.589
I got 'em!

20:13.713 --> 20:15.589
I'm here!

20:15.631 --> 20:17.466
(Lorelai)

20:15.631 --> 20:17.466
'Oh, great. Get in here.'

20:17.508 --> 20:19.343
I bought all the glue

20:17.508 --> 20:19.343
and glitter they had.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.594
Perfect.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.471
So, what are you

20:20.636 --> 20:22.471
thinking here?

20:22.513 --> 20:26.017
I don't know. Something

20:22.513 --> 20:26.017
colorful or something peaceful.

20:26.059 --> 20:30.104
You know, it could be a Zen sort

20:26.059 --> 20:30.104
of space, or a yoga studio.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.480
Drew Barrymore has one.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.273
- Oh, and she looks very calm.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.273
- Yeah.

20:33.315 --> 20:36.360
I just want it to be

20:33.315 --> 20:36.360
a special all-me alone place.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.904
Here. Look in this for ideas.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.031
Ooh. "Classic Hollywood Homes."

20:40.073 --> 20:41.657
- Oh, look what I found.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.657
- A disco ball.

20:41.699 --> 20:43.034
Where'd you find a disco ball?

20:43.076 --> 20:45.411
- In my closet.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.411
- Wow.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.496
[cellphone rings]

20:47.538 --> 20:49.456
I should have done

20:47.538 --> 20:49.456
this years ago.

20:49.498 --> 20:50.750
Hello?

20:50.791 --> 20:53.044
I heard a noise

20:50.791 --> 20:53.044
in the kitchen.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.378
What kind of noise?

20:54.420 --> 20:57.506
A bam or a clang

20:54.420 --> 20:57.506
or possibly a crash.

20:57.548 --> 21:00.384
'It might have been

20:57.548 --> 21:00.384
a wham or a ka-pow.'

21:00.426 --> 21:01.677
Well, did you go check it out?

21:01.719 --> 21:04.889
Excuse me.

21:01.719 --> 21:04.889
I'm extremely busy.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.724
Someone here has to work.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.976
I mean, the two of you

21:06.766 --> 21:08.976
just run off

21:09.018 --> 21:11.104
to do your little

21:09.018 --> 21:11.104
decorating project

21:11.145 --> 21:12.646
and you leave me

21:11.145 --> 21:12.646
here alone.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.732
Michel, did you actually

21:12.688 --> 21:14.732
hear a noise?

21:14.774 --> 21:16.234
Of course I heard a noise.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.694
It was a thwap or a boom.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.154
Gotta go, Michel.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.948
What's the matter?

21:21.989 --> 21:24.408
Apparently, Batman's

21:21.989 --> 21:24.408
attacking the inn.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.577
Hey, Moulin Rouge,

21:24.450 --> 21:26.577
what do you think?

21:26.619 --> 21:29.038
Jeweled elephant in one corner,

21:26.619 --> 21:29.038
Ewan McGregor in the other.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.706
Ooh, sounds yummy.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.708
[cellphone rings]

21:32.750 --> 21:34.752
What, Michel?

21:34.794 --> 21:38.131
I'm smelling something very

21:34.794 --> 21:38.131
funny coming from the kitchen.

21:38.172 --> 21:41.550
Could be a pungent cheese,

21:38.172 --> 21:41.550
could be arson.

21:41.592 --> 21:43.302
Should I call

21:41.592 --> 21:43.302
the firemen to come

21:43.343 --> 21:45.805
'or should I just fetch

21:43.343 --> 21:45.805
some crackers?'

21:49.016 --> 21:51.978
Ah, Rory. Good.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.978
I'm glad you're here.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.729
I wanted to talk to you

21:52.019 --> 21:53.729
about something.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.815
I think we need

21:53.771 --> 21:55.815
to discuss the incident

21:55.856 --> 21:57.024
at "The Daily News"

21:55.856 --> 21:57.024
the other day.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.442
What incident, Doyle?

21:58.484 --> 21:59.986
We were in the middle

21:58.484 --> 21:59.986
of a meeting.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.946
I, your editor,

22:00.027 --> 22:01.946
was talking.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.364
And suddenly, without warning,

22:01.988 --> 22:04.364
you flew out of the room.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.659
I was gone

22:04.406 --> 22:06.659
for five minutes, Doyle.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.368
Yes, but the very fact

22:06.700 --> 22:08.368
that you felt comfortable enough

22:08.410 --> 22:10.370
to leave

22:08.410 --> 22:10.370
signals a big problem.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.206
I had to talk to a friend.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.083
This is a matter

22:12.248 --> 22:14.083
of respect, Rory.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.460
Respect for the paper,

22:14.125 --> 22:16.460
respect for me.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.087
'Frankly, respect for yourself.'

22:18.129 --> 22:20.089
- Doyle--

22:18.129 --> 22:20.089
- I have a pebble in my shoe.

22:20.131 --> 22:21.924
Damn thing's been

22:20.131 --> 22:21.924
driving me crazy all day long.

22:23.759 --> 22:26.095
- 'Anyhow, where was I?'

22:23.759 --> 22:26.095
- My lack of respect for you.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.554
'Yes, good. Thank you.'

22:27.596 --> 22:29.015
You have to remember

22:27.596 --> 22:29.015
that this is college.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.516
You're training

22:29.056 --> 22:30.516
for real life here.

22:30.557 --> 22:31.934
You need to start

22:30.557 --> 22:31.934
developing boundaries

22:31.976 --> 22:33.560
between your work

22:31.976 --> 22:33.560
and your personal life.

22:33.602 --> 22:34.645
- Doyle!

22:33.602 --> 22:34.645
- What?

22:34.687 --> 22:35.771
Your sock is on my coffee table!

22:35.813 --> 22:36.856
Just for a second.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.524
You wanna talk about boundaries?

22:38.565 --> 22:41.277
You are here every day. You eat

22:38.565 --> 22:41.277
my food, you drink my soda.

22:41.319 --> 22:43.112
You have a key,

22:41.319 --> 22:43.112
and you don't even live here.

22:43.154 --> 22:44.655
Paris said

22:43.154 --> 22:44.655
<i>"Mi casa, su casa."</i>

22:44.697 --> 22:47.200
Great! Well, Paris'<i> casa</i>

22:44.697 --> 22:47.200
is right in there.

22:47.241 --> 22:49.451
So go in or get lost,

22:47.241 --> 22:49.451
because I have company coming

22:49.493 --> 22:51.287
and I don't want the first

22:49.493 --> 22:51.287
thing he sees when he walks in

22:51.329 --> 22:52.579
to be your feet or your face.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.414
But, but I'm your editor.

22:54.456 --> 22:57.210
Out! And take

22:54.456 --> 22:57.210
your pebble with you!

22:57.251 --> 22:58.502
I bet

22:57.251 --> 22:58.502
Woodward and Bernstein

22:58.544 --> 23:00.296
never tossed Ben Bradley

22:58.544 --> 23:00.296
out of their room!

23:00.338 --> 23:02.298
Ben Bradley

23:00.338 --> 23:02.298
kept his shoes on!

23:03.590 --> 23:05.467
I don't know

23:03.590 --> 23:05.467
if anyone has noticed

23:05.509 --> 23:07.928
but suddenly,

23:05.509 --> 23:07.928
<i>I</i> am the only one working.

23:07.970 --> 23:09.680
You're right.

23:07.970 --> 23:09.680
No one noticed.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.557
My arm is cramping up.

23:11.598 --> 23:12.975
We offered

23:11.598 --> 23:12.975
to take over, Michel.

23:13.017 --> 23:15.019
These stencils

23:13.017 --> 23:15.019
are antiques.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.478
They've been handed down

23:16.520 --> 23:18.480
from generation

23:16.520 --> 23:18.480
to generation of Girards.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.649
No one touches

23:18.522 --> 23:20.649
these stencils but me.

23:20.691 --> 23:23.152
- Okay.

23:20.691 --> 23:23.152
- The fumes are making me sick.

23:23.194 --> 23:25.363
Oh, my God.

23:23.194 --> 23:25.363
You had a fit to be included.

23:25.403 --> 23:26.947
And you did nothing

23:25.403 --> 23:26.947
but complain since you got here.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.866
I did not have

23:26.989 --> 23:28.866
a fit to be included.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.451
I have a life.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.451
I have plenty of friends.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.411
And I dare you to find anyone

23:31.493 --> 23:33.411
who has a larger collection

23:33.453 --> 23:35.331
of techno

23:33.453 --> 23:35.331
and rock music than I do.

23:35.373 --> 23:37.457
I'm fulfilled and need

23:35.373 --> 23:37.457
nothing from either one of you.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.168
- Poor Michel.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.168
- 'No!'

23:39.210 --> 23:41.837
Do not "poor Michel" me! No!

23:41.879 --> 23:44.548
Well, I have to say,

23:41.879 --> 23:44.548
for only a few hours' work

23:44.590 --> 23:47.301
this place looks

23:44.590 --> 23:47.301
pretty snazzy.

23:47.343 --> 23:49.845
I have finished

23:47.343 --> 23:49.845
with this wall.

23:49.887 --> 23:52.098
Super.

23:49.887 --> 23:52.098
Three more to go.

23:52.139 --> 23:55.642
Sometimes doing one wall

23:52.139 --> 23:55.642
makes it the focal point.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.353
Place of interest.

23:57.395 --> 24:00.064
- All four walls, Michel.

23:57.395 --> 24:00.064
- You tricked me into this.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.191
- Just like Tom Sawyer.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.191
- 'So, what do you think?'

24:02.233 --> 24:04.735
Is it turning into exactly

24:02.233 --> 24:04.735
what you had in mind?

24:04.777 --> 24:06.779
'Your special,

24:04.777 --> 24:06.779
all-you, alone place?'

24:07.947 --> 24:09.865
Yeah. It sure is.

24:17.664 --> 24:19.333
- What's up, Doc?

24:17.664 --> 24:19.333
- "What's up, Doc?"

24:19.375 --> 24:21.335
Well, Harpo doesn't talk,

24:19.375 --> 24:21.335
so there's no catch phrase.

24:21.377 --> 24:23.045
- Well, then, do Groucho.

24:21.377 --> 24:23.045
- Everybody does Groucho.

24:23.087 --> 24:25.463
Come in, come in.

24:25.505 --> 24:28.175
I...like what you've done

24:25.505 --> 24:28.175
with the place.

24:28.217 --> 24:31.178
Well, it's all about the vibe.

24:28.217 --> 24:31.178
Hey, what did you bring?

24:31.220 --> 24:33.597
Just some leftovers from

24:31.220 --> 24:33.597
the Cartina engagement party.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.266
I told you

24:33.639 --> 24:35.266
I'd take care of the food.

24:35.308 --> 24:36.683
And I see you did.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.685
Pretzels of the world.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.187
San Francisco sourdough

24:40.229 --> 24:42.315
German pumpernickel,

24:40.229 --> 24:42.315
chocolate-covered Swiss

24:42.356 --> 24:44.233
and the wasabi bites

24:42.356 --> 24:44.233
are very intriguing.

24:44.275 --> 24:45.901
I also ordered a pizza

24:44.275 --> 24:45.901
before you got here.

24:45.943 --> 24:47.611
Okay, well, at least we've

24:45.943 --> 24:47.611
got the food part covered.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.029
Yes, we do.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.029
Sit, sit, sit.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.453
You gonna stay like that

24:53.575 --> 24:55.453
all night?

24:55.493 --> 24:56.870
Oh, no. Sorry.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.372
- I mean, you can.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.372
- No, it's okay.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.040
- I mean, it works for you.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.040
- No, I'm good.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.919
I guess we should

25:02.209 --> 25:03.919
start the movie.

25:03.961 --> 25:05.212
- Okay.

25:07.505 --> 25:09.425
[duck quacking]

25:13.637 --> 25:15.555
- Wasabi nugget?

25:13.637 --> 25:15.555
- Thanks.

25:20.727 --> 25:22.980
You in a little bit

25:20.727 --> 25:22.980
of pain there?

25:23.022 --> 25:24.690
Much, much more

25:23.022 --> 25:24.690
than a little.

25:24.731 --> 25:27.609
Oh, don't worry. Your mouth

25:24.731 --> 25:27.609
will get numb in about a minute.

25:27.651 --> 25:28.652
I'm really looking forward

25:27.651 --> 25:28.652
to that.

25:28.694 --> 25:29.695
How about a soda?

25:29.736 --> 25:31.780
That would be terrific. Thanks.

25:31.822 --> 25:33.115
Well, thank you very much

25:33.157 --> 25:35.368
for kicking my undefined

25:33.157 --> 25:35.368
sexual male partner

25:35.409 --> 25:36.618
out of the room

25:35.409 --> 25:36.618
that we share.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.953
I had company coming, Paris.

25:37.995 --> 25:39.663
'You insulted him.

25:37.995 --> 25:39.663
You demeaned him.'

25:39.705 --> 25:40.789
'You made him

25:39.705 --> 25:40.789
feel unwelcome.'

25:40.831 --> 25:42.500
He<i> was</i> unwelcome.

25:42.540 --> 25:44.377
'And now, thanks to you,

25:42.540 --> 25:44.377
he refuses to come back here'

25:44.418 --> 25:46.295
'which means I have to spend

25:44.418 --> 25:46.295
the night over at his place'

25:46.337 --> 25:48.005
with his three roommates.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.547
The place is a health violation.

25:49.589 --> 25:52.009
Things grow on the windowsill

25:49.589 --> 25:52.009
without the help of pot

25:52.051 --> 25:54.761
or soil and there is the faint

25:52.051 --> 25:54.761
aroma of sweat socks

25:54.803 --> 25:57.097
and starter cologne lingering

25:54.803 --> 25:57.097
in the air at all times.

25:57.139 --> 25:59.850
And yes, I have to bring

25:57.139 --> 25:59.850
my own toilet paper over there

25:59.892 --> 26:01.268
because it is

25:59.892 --> 26:01.268
a third world country.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.769
Thank you! Very, very much!

26:04.397 --> 26:05.356
[door slams]

26:08.192 --> 26:09.402
God, I missed this place.

26:11.487 --> 26:14.740
Now that's a counter-sunk screw,

26:11.487 --> 26:14.740
Damon. Good man.

26:14.781 --> 26:16.492
Your lesbian mother

26:14.781 --> 26:16.492
will be proud.

26:18.411 --> 26:21.997
Oh, hey, Lulu, uh,

26:18.411 --> 26:21.997
it's the big day, you know?

26:22.039 --> 26:24.833
- I know. It's so exciting.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.833
- Yeah, but, uh..

26:24.875 --> 26:27.253
I'm still wondering

26:24.875 --> 26:27.253
where the other adults are.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.795
- They'll be here.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.795
- Yeah.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.130
You've been saying

26:28.837 --> 26:30.130
that for days yet I'm still

26:30.172 --> 26:32.091
the only person in here

26:30.172 --> 26:32.091
that doesn't have to

26:32.132 --> 26:33.467
hang his sheets out

26:32.132 --> 26:33.467
his window in the morning.

26:33.509 --> 26:34.927
I don't understand.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.179
- They wet their beds, Lulu.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.179
- Oh, right.

26:37.221 --> 26:39.098
Well, I promise you,

26:37.221 --> 26:39.098
Luke, by tonight

26:39.139 --> 26:41.767
there'll be lots of grown-ups

26:39.139 --> 26:41.767
here for you to talk to.

26:41.808 --> 26:43.769
I-i-it's not about having

26:41.808 --> 26:43.769
someone to talk to.

26:43.810 --> 26:44.811
- It's a--

26:43.810 --> 26:44.811
- Luke, we've got a problem.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.146
Yeah? What is it, Kirk?

26:46.188 --> 26:48.274
Well, this dairy cart

26:46.188 --> 26:48.274
you made me..

26:48.315 --> 26:49.942
What's wrong with it?

26:49.983 --> 26:53.070
It pulls too easily,

26:49.983 --> 26:53.070
and the wheel doesn't wobble.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.281
- So what?

26:53.112 --> 26:55.281
- Well, it's too good.

26:55.322 --> 26:57.533
You've built me

26:55.322 --> 26:57.533
a 21st century dairy cart.

26:57.575 --> 26:59.410
There's no such thing

26:57.575 --> 26:59.410
as a 21st century dairy cart.

26:59.452 --> 27:01.995
Exactly. Look,

26:59.452 --> 27:01.995
Tevye's a poor man.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.330
I mean, you've heard the song.

27:03.372 --> 27:05.291
Yes, I've heard the song, Kirk.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.960
Okay, so he's poor,

27:05.332 --> 27:07.960
he's tired.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.711
He's suffering

27:08.001 --> 27:09.711
and his horse is lame.

27:09.753 --> 27:12.298
'His life is hard, so pulling

27:09.753 --> 27:12.298
this cart should be hard.'

27:12.339 --> 27:14.133
You're an actor.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.133
Pretend it's hard.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.009
I'm not that kind of actor.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.677
For my type of work, it has

27:16.051 --> 27:17.677
to be legitimately hard.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.180
There you go.

27:20.222 --> 27:22.057
Remember to thank me

27:20.222 --> 27:22.057
in your acceptance speech.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.892
Thank you, Luke.

27:25.936 --> 27:27.396
Hey! This is impossible!

27:27.438 --> 27:29.482
Alright, kids,

27:27.438 --> 27:29.482
break's over!

27:29.523 --> 27:31.484
Kirk, let's take it

27:29.523 --> 27:31.484
from the last part

27:31.525 --> 27:32.610
of your first monologue.

27:32.650 --> 27:34.320
Alright, places, everyone.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.950
And...music.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.952
[piano music]

27:41.994 --> 27:43.579
Because of our traditions

27:43.621 --> 27:46.499
we've kept our balance

27:43.621 --> 27:46.499
for many, many years.

27:46.540 --> 27:50.628
Here, in Anatevka, we have

27:46.540 --> 27:50.628
traditions for everything.

27:50.668 --> 27:54.465
'How to eat, how to sleep,

27:50.668 --> 27:54.465
how to wear clothes.'

27:54.507 --> 27:58.135
For instance, we always keep

27:54.507 --> 27:58.135
our heads covered

27:58.177 --> 28:00.762
and always wear

This shows our constant

28:00.804 --> 28:04.266
devotion to God.

28:04.308 --> 28:07.603
You may ask, how did this

28:04.308 --> 28:07.603
tradition start?

28:08.437 --> 28:09.813
I'll tell you.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.483
I don't know.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.234
But it's a tradition.

28:14.276 --> 28:16.069
Because of our traditions

28:16.111 --> 28:19.532
everyone knows who he is,

28:16.111 --> 28:19.532
and what God expects him to do.

Hey, she tripped!

28:47.267 --> 28:49.687
Yente tripped!

28:49.728 --> 28:52.606
Damn it! I was feeling it,

28:49.728 --> 28:52.606
people! I was feeling it!

28:52.648 --> 28:54.149
Anna, honey, are you okay?

28:54.191 --> 28:55.984
No, she's not okay.

28:54.191 --> 28:55.984
She tripped!

28:56.026 --> 28:57.486
She's fine, Luke.

28:57.528 --> 28:58.987
How would you know

28:57.528 --> 28:58.987
if she's fine?

28:59.029 --> 29:00.573
Your kid's under a chair

28:59.029 --> 29:00.573
somewhere.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.491
- Luke.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.491
- Her costume doesn't fit.

29:02.533 --> 29:03.742
We'll fix it

29:02.533 --> 29:03.742
before the show.

29:03.783 --> 29:05.452
It should have

29:03.783 --> 29:05.452
been fixed by now.

29:05.494 --> 29:07.120
I-I mean, this

29:05.494 --> 29:07.120
shouldn't have happened.

29:07.162 --> 29:09.873
I mean, there were supposed

29:07.162 --> 29:09.873
to be other adults here.

29:09.915 --> 29:12.000
This is ridiculous!

29:12.042 --> 29:14.294
T-t-this is completely

29:12.042 --> 29:14.294
unacceptable!

29:17.172 --> 29:19.341
He takes his work

29:17.172 --> 29:19.341
very seriously.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.176
I mean it. Just try

29:19.383 --> 29:21.176
and pull this cart.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.388
[truck door slams]

29:27.015 --> 29:28.100
Hey.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.851
Hey, Luke.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.851
What are you--

29:29.893 --> 29:31.811
- Yente tripped.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.811
- What?

29:31.853 --> 29:33.146
She tripped, just as

29:31.853 --> 29:33.146
she was heading out

29:33.188 --> 29:34.481
to tell Avram about Ruchel.

29:34.523 --> 29:35.982
- The shoemaker's daughter?

29:34.523 --> 29:35.982
- Yeah.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.484
She's trying to fix him up

29:36.024 --> 29:37.484
with Avram's son.

29:37.526 --> 29:39.194
But she's almost blind.

29:37.526 --> 29:39.194
She can hardly see.

29:39.236 --> 29:41.321
Hey. I am not doing

29:39.236 --> 29:41.321
a bit with you here.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.823
The kid tripped because

29:41.363 --> 29:43.823
her dress was too long.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.284
- Okay. Is she hurt?

29:43.865 --> 29:45.284
- Of course she's not hurt.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.910
But she completely

29:45.325 --> 29:46.910
blew her entrance.

29:46.952 --> 29:49.037
And all the people of Anatevka

29:46.952 --> 29:49.037
are standing around

29:49.079 --> 29:50.456
with their goats

29:49.079 --> 29:50.456
and she tripped and..

29:50.497 --> 29:52.124
- They had to reset the goats.

29:50.497 --> 29:52.124
- Luke--

29:52.165 --> 29:53.833
And if you were there

29:52.165 --> 29:53.833
where you were supposed to be

29:53.875 --> 29:56.002
her costume would have fit,

29:53.875 --> 29:56.002
and Yente wouldn't have tripped.

29:56.044 --> 29:58.004
What do you mean,

29:56.044 --> 29:58.004
where I was supposed to be?

29:58.046 --> 30:00.090
You're making the costumes.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.090
At least, that's the rumor.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.592
I'm making the sets,

30:00.132 --> 30:01.592
and I'm there.

30:01.634 --> 30:02.842
Yeah. I am making

30:01.634 --> 30:02.842
the costumes.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.428
I'm making the costumes here

30:04.470 --> 30:06.179
and I'm bringing them there

30:04.470 --> 30:06.179
when they are done.

30:06.221 --> 30:09.015
- Oh, sure. A likely story.

30:06.221 --> 30:09.015
- Hey! What is your problem?

30:09.057 --> 30:11.143
My problem is,

30:09.057 --> 30:11.143
is that I'm spending the day

30:11.184 --> 30:12.519
teachin' a bunch of kids

30:11.184 --> 30:12.519
how to use tools

30:12.561 --> 30:13.895
which won't properly

30:12.561 --> 30:13.895
fit in their hands

30:13.937 --> 30:15.439
for another

30:13.937 --> 30:15.439
8 to 10 years because

30:15.481 --> 30:16.774
you signed me up

30:15.481 --> 30:16.774
to do it and then you're not

30:16.856 --> 30:18.317
even there when

30:16.856 --> 30:18.317
you're supposed to be.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.152
- Well, you could have said no.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.152
- I could've said no.

30:20.193 --> 30:22.195
Have you tried saying no

30:20.193 --> 30:22.195
to Bradley when he's got

30:22.237 --> 30:23.739
a giant inhaler

30:22.237 --> 30:23.739
shoved in his mouth?

30:23.781 --> 30:25.073
- No.

30:23.781 --> 30:25.073
- Well, you can't!

30:26.366 --> 30:28.661
What the hell

30:26.366 --> 30:28.661
am I lookin' at?

30:28.702 --> 30:32.164
It's my new, uh,

30:28.702 --> 30:32.164
new special alone space.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.374
Oh, yeah? Well, you got a whole

30:32.205 --> 30:34.374
house of special alone space.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.042
- Not like this.

30:34.416 --> 30:36.042
- So, what?

30:36.084 --> 30:37.670
Are you going to hang out

30:36.084 --> 30:37.670
in your garage, now?

30:37.711 --> 30:39.338
I don't know, maybe.

30:37.711 --> 30:39.338
I mean, why not?

30:39.379 --> 30:41.715
It's not like I have a boat

30:39.379 --> 30:41.715
that needs storage or anything.

30:41.757 --> 30:43.049
You could park your car in here.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.635
I never park my car in here!

30:44.677 --> 30:46.720
I have never, ever parked

30:44.677 --> 30:46.720
my car in here, Luke.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.430
And you know that.

30:48.472 --> 30:52.267
But I come home to this big,

30:48.472 --> 30:52.267
huge, suddenly empty space

30:52.309 --> 30:54.227
and I thought I would

30:52.309 --> 30:54.227
try to do something nice

30:54.269 --> 30:56.689
so it wasn't just a giant hole

30:54.269 --> 30:56.689
of depression sitting out here.

30:56.730 --> 30:58.064
I thought I was

30:56.730 --> 30:58.064
doin' you a favor.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.566
- Oh, please.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.566
- I did!

30:59.608 --> 31:00.818
Well, gee. Thanks a lot.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.653
- It's your garage.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.653
- Whatever.

31:02.695 --> 31:03.737
I mean, w-w-what was I

31:02.695 --> 31:03.737
supposed to do?

31:03.779 --> 31:05.030
Leave the thing in here forever?

31:05.071 --> 31:06.657
Oh, no. Absolutely not.

31:06.699 --> 31:07.949
Much better

31:06.699 --> 31:07.949
to sneak it out of here

31:07.991 --> 31:09.326
and park it

31:07.991 --> 31:09.326
in front of the diner

31:09.368 --> 31:10.661
like a giant

31:09.368 --> 31:10.661
"They broke up" billboard

31:10.703 --> 31:11.745
for the whole town to see.

31:11.787 --> 31:12.996
I didn't mean it like that.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.331
Well, how did you mean it, Luke?

31:14.373 --> 31:15.749
I can't believe

31:14.373 --> 31:15.749
you're mad at me

31:15.791 --> 31:17.459
for getting my boat

31:15.791 --> 31:17.459
out of your garage.

31:17.501 --> 31:19.378
I'm not mad at you because you

31:17.501 --> 31:19.378
got your boat out of my garage.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.714
I am mad for the<i> way</i> you got

31:19.419 --> 31:21.714
the boat out of my garage.

31:21.755 --> 31:24.090
- What, did I ruin the lawn?

31:21.755 --> 31:24.090
- You didn't even call me, Luke.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.092
You didn't leave a message

31:24.132 --> 31:26.092
or a note or anything.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.678
You just snuck in and took it.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.805
And I, and I got to come home

31:27.720 --> 31:29.805
and find it gone.

31:29.847 --> 31:31.598
Although, I didn't come home

31:29.847 --> 31:31.598
and find it gone.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.226
I drove by the diner

31:31.640 --> 31:34.226
and assumed it was gone.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.269
You know what? It doesn't

31:34.267 --> 31:36.269
matter, 'cause it's done.

31:36.311 --> 31:39.398
<i>We're</i> done. It's fine.

31:36.311 --> 31:39.398
I'm not mad.

31:39.439 --> 31:40.566
I can tell.

31:40.607 --> 31:41.734
Well, I have dresses to make

31:41.775 --> 31:43.235
so I'll see you

31:41.775 --> 31:43.235
at the theater.

31:49.282 --> 31:50.492
(Groucho Marx on TV)

31:49.282 --> 31:50.492
'Now, have you ever

31:49.282 --> 31:50.492
heard one of our..'

31:50.534 --> 31:51.702
I'm gonna say

31:50.534 --> 31:51.702
something that will upset

31:51.744 --> 31:52.703
possibly everyone

31:51.744 --> 31:52.703
in the entire world.

31:52.745 --> 31:53.871
Wow.

31:53.912 --> 31:54.954
I thought

31:53.912 --> 31:54.954
the "I Love Lucy" episode

31:54.996 --> 31:56.039
with Harpo Marx was lame.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.666
Get out.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.084
There's no way Harpo, even for

31:57.708 --> 31:59.084
a second would have believed

31:59.125 --> 32:00.126
he was looking

31:59.125 --> 32:00.126
in the mirror.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.712
And the last time

32:00.168 --> 32:01.712
they made

32:01.754 --> 32:03.505
that "popping up from behind

32:01.754 --> 32:03.505
the partition" move

32:03.547 --> 32:05.257
she was

32:03.547 --> 32:05.257
totally slower than him.

32:05.298 --> 32:07.133
You've carried this with you

32:05.298 --> 32:07.133
for a very long time.

32:07.175 --> 32:09.720
I mean, we had to believe a lot

32:07.175 --> 32:09.720
during those Hollywood shows.

32:09.762 --> 32:12.765
Dore Schary just happened to be

32:09.762 --> 32:12.765
hanging out at their pool.

32:12.806 --> 32:14.808
I'm sorry, I was totally

32:12.806 --> 32:14.808
with Lucy

32:14.850 --> 32:16.852
when Ricky took those women

32:14.850 --> 32:16.852
to the premiere of<i> his</i> movie.

32:16.894 --> 32:18.311
What an ass.

32:18.353 --> 32:20.606
You've got to stop watching

32:18.353 --> 32:20.606
"I Love Lucy."

32:20.647 --> 32:21.857
[knock on door]

32:21.899 --> 32:23.650
Oh, man,

32:21.899 --> 32:23.650
I hope that's Paris.

32:23.692 --> 32:24.943
Maybe she and Doyle

32:23.692 --> 32:24.943
had a fight.

32:24.984 --> 32:26.152
That would be great.

32:26.194 --> 32:27.654
There's so much darkness

32:27.696 --> 32:30.073
under this bosom buddies

32:27.696 --> 32:30.073
exterior of yours.

32:31.742 --> 32:33.869
- Hello, stranger.

32:31.742 --> 32:33.869
- Hi. You're back.

32:33.911 --> 32:36.329
- Just rolled in.

32:33.911 --> 32:36.329
- So, how was it? Was it fun?

32:36.371 --> 32:37.790
No, very dull.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.790
Let's not talk about it.

32:37.831 --> 32:39.332
We're all going to

32:37.831 --> 32:39.332
China Palace for food.

32:39.374 --> 32:42.043
- Grab your coat. Let's go.

32:39.374 --> 32:42.043
- Oh. Um, I can't.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.169
What? Sure you can.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.169
Come on, I missed you.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.797
Let me buy you a fortune cookie.

32:44.838 --> 32:46.548
- I kind of have company.

32:44.838 --> 32:46.548
- Really? Anyone I know?

32:48.675 --> 32:51.261
- Hey, Marty. Good to see you.

32:48.675 --> 32:51.261
- Uh, yeah, you, too.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.471
Well, you come, too.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.471
The more the merrier.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.180
- Oh, well..

32:52.512 --> 32:54.180
- Come on, Marty.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.891
If you're gonna be

32:54.222 --> 32:55.891
hanging with Ace like this

32:55.933 --> 32:57.142
then it's time I get to know you

32:55.933 --> 32:57.142
without a waiter's uniform on.

32:57.183 --> 32:58.644
Let's go.

32:57.183 --> 32:58.644
Car's waitin' outside.

33:00.437 --> 33:02.481
We do not have to go.

33:02.522 --> 33:04.107
But you want to.

33:04.149 --> 33:07.068
No. Well, I mean, if you do,

33:04.149 --> 33:07.068
but you don't, so forget it.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.488
Uh, it's cool.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.488
Let's go.

33:09.529 --> 33:12.157
Really? Are you sure?

33:09.529 --> 33:12.157
Because you don't look sure.

33:12.198 --> 33:15.702
Sure, I'm sure.

33:12.198 --> 33:15.702
Car's waiting outside.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.663
Okay, but if we get bored

33:15.744 --> 33:17.663
or if Dore Schary

33:17.704 --> 33:18.956
happens to be there,

33:17.704 --> 33:18.956
then we bail.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.791
- Deal.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.791
- Okay, I'll get my coat.

33:23.836 --> 33:25.587
I swear, I thought

33:23.836 --> 33:25.587
he was never gonna wake up.

33:25.629 --> 33:26.672
If I knew the hangover

33:25.629 --> 33:26.672
was going to last

33:26.713 --> 33:28.047
that long, I wouldn't have.

33:28.089 --> 33:29.549
There's nothing like

33:28.089 --> 33:29.549
a charming, little

33:29.591 --> 33:30.843
"you wouldn't believe

33:29.591 --> 33:30.843
how drunk I got" story

33:30.884 --> 33:31.969
to get the girls all hot.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.804
It's always worked before.

33:33.846 --> 33:35.681
Oh, God, the smell of this food

33:33.846 --> 33:35.681
is making me ill.

33:35.722 --> 33:36.974
Mmm. I think it's delicious.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.433
How can you eat

33:37.015 --> 33:38.433
like that?

33:38.475 --> 33:40.519
Juliet hasn't eaten

33:38.475 --> 33:40.519
a meal since 1994.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.270
My metabolism simply

33:40.560 --> 33:42.270
doesn't accept food.

33:42.312 --> 33:44.356
Yes, that must

33:42.312 --> 33:44.356
be a modern medical miracle.

33:44.397 --> 33:45.774
- May I?

33:44.397 --> 33:45.774
- 'Sure.'

33:45.816 --> 33:47.359
Hey, Marty,

33:45.816 --> 33:47.359
do you want some beer?

33:47.400 --> 33:48.986
- Here you go, man. I got you.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.986
- Thanks.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.445
Rosemary's going home

33:49.027 --> 33:50.445
with me tonight.

33:50.487 --> 33:52.280
I just thought everyone

33:50.487 --> 33:52.280
at this table should know.

33:52.322 --> 33:53.991
Oh, Finn,

33:52.322 --> 33:53.991
you do hallucinate.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.241
Are you gonna eat

33:54.032 --> 33:55.241
that fried shrimp?

33:55.283 --> 33:56.952
- I think I am.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.952
- Oh, God. Can I watch?

33:56.994 --> 33:58.871
- Juliet, just eat something.

33:56.994 --> 33:58.871
- 'No.'

33:58.912 --> 34:01.289
I am not eating until

33:58.912 --> 34:01.289
I get married to some gorgeous

34:01.331 --> 34:03.458
but very poor man who will

34:01.331 --> 34:03.458
sign an iron-clad pre-nup.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.168
'And then I will

34:03.500 --> 34:05.168
get very, very fat'

34:05.210 --> 34:06.628
but he won't ever leave me

34:05.210 --> 34:06.628
because he would be cut off

34:06.670 --> 34:08.129
without a penny

34:06.670 --> 34:08.129
and die in a trailer park.

34:08.171 --> 34:09.923
- My God. That is brilliant.

34:08.171 --> 34:09.923
- That is sick.

34:09.965 --> 34:11.174
I agree with anything

34:09.965 --> 34:11.174
Rosemary says tonight.

34:11.216 --> 34:13.134
Not going home

34:11.216 --> 34:13.134
with you, Finn.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.761
(Colin)

34:13.176 --> 34:14.761
'You know where they have the

34:13.176 --> 34:14.761
best Chinese food in the world?'

34:14.803 --> 34:16.513
This tiny, little place

34:14.803 --> 34:16.513
outside Zugerberg.

34:16.555 --> 34:19.349
- Oh, Zugerberg!

34:16.555 --> 34:19.349
- The golden days of Zugerberg.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.100
What's Zugerberg?

34:21.142 --> 34:22.519
Zugerberg's the boarding school

34:21.142 --> 34:22.519
I went to in Switzerland.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.437
- Really?

34:22.561 --> 34:24.437
- 'Yep. Grades 7 through 12.'

34:24.479 --> 34:26.523
Wow, living in Switzerland.

34:24.479 --> 34:26.523
That sounds exciting.

34:26.565 --> 34:29.108
Boarding school.

34:26.565 --> 34:29.108
Man, that must have sucked.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.694
Sucked? Are you kidding?

34:30.736 --> 34:32.404
Those were

34:30.736 --> 34:32.404
the greatest days of my life.

34:32.445 --> 34:34.531
'Oh, my God. The partying

34:32.445 --> 34:34.531
that went on there, insane.'

34:34.573 --> 34:35.908
I did a year at Andover.

34:34.573 --> 34:35.908
Not bad.

34:35.949 --> 34:38.076
So, you didn't miss

34:35.949 --> 34:38.076
your home, your family?

34:38.117 --> 34:40.453
My family?

34:38.117 --> 34:40.453
Did I miss my family?

34:40.495 --> 34:42.581
- 'Logan, did I miss my family?'

34:40.495 --> 34:42.581
- Huh. Let's see.

34:42.622 --> 34:44.290
- Which mom were you on then?

34:42.622 --> 34:44.290
- I believe it was the blonde.

34:44.332 --> 34:45.751
- Oh, yes.

34:44.332 --> 34:45.751
- 'She was hot.'

34:45.792 --> 34:47.126
'You didn't know her, Finn.'

34:47.168 --> 34:48.587
All your mothers

34:47.168 --> 34:48.587
have been hot, Colin.

34:48.628 --> 34:50.630
No, Marty,

34:48.628 --> 34:50.630
I didn't miss my family.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.591
[laughter]

34:55.510 --> 34:59.514
Tevye, I suppose you know

34:55.510 --> 34:59.514
why I've come to see you.

34:59.556 --> 35:01.516
Yes, I do, Rabbi Lazar

35:01.558 --> 35:04.185
but there's no use

35:01.558 --> 35:04.185
talking about it.

35:04.227 --> 35:05.395
Why not?

35:05.437 --> 35:06.563
Why yes?

35:06.605 --> 35:08.690
Why should I

35:06.605 --> 35:08.690
get rid of her?

35:08.732 --> 35:11.150
Well, you have

35:08.732 --> 35:11.150
a few more without her.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.736
I see.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.279
Today you want one.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.114
Tomorrow you may want two.

35:17.741 --> 35:19.325
Here you go.

35:19.367 --> 35:22.788
Now, no more bottle butting

35:19.367 --> 35:22.788
till the show's over.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.122
Here you go, Paulie.

35:24.163 --> 35:25.665
Sneak that out there

35:24.163 --> 35:25.665
when they start dancin'.

35:25.707 --> 35:28.001
(Kirk)

35:25.707 --> 35:28.001
'Why is it so important to you?'

35:28.043 --> 35:30.796
(boy)

35:28.043 --> 35:30.796
'Frankly, because I'm lonesome.'

35:30.837 --> 35:32.338
(Kirk)

35:30.837 --> 35:32.338
'Lonesome?'

35:32.380 --> 35:35.592
- 'What are you talking about?'

35:32.380 --> 35:35.592
- 'You don't know?'

35:35.634 --> 35:37.719
(Kirk)

35:35.634 --> 35:37.719
'We're talking about my new cow!

35:35.634 --> 35:37.719
The one you want to buy..'

35:37.761 --> 35:39.972
- I've got a hammer.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.972
- Oh, I know you do.

35:40.013 --> 35:42.724
(boy)

35:40.013 --> 35:42.724
'A new cow?

35:40.013 --> 35:42.724
So I won't be lonesome?'

35:42.766 --> 35:43.976
[boy laughing]

35:44.017 --> 35:45.644
(Kirk)

35:44.017 --> 35:45.644
'What's so funny?'

35:45.685 --> 35:47.980
(boy)

35:45.685 --> 35:47.980
'I was talking

35:45.685 --> 35:47.980
about your daughter.'

35:48.021 --> 35:50.189
- I need that schwanza.

35:48.021 --> 35:50.189
- Oh, okay. I got it, I got it.

35:50.231 --> 35:52.317
- Sara. Where'd Sara go?

35:50.231 --> 35:52.317
- Relax. We'll find her.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.821
(Kirk)

35:53.902 --> 35:55.821
'Shame on you!

35:53.902 --> 35:55.821
Shame on you!'

35:55.862 --> 35:57.114
(Finn)

35:55.862 --> 35:57.114
'Okay, the night's young.

35:55.862 --> 35:57.114
Where are we going next?'

35:57.155 --> 35:58.573
I don't think I can move.

35:58.615 --> 36:00.283
You're full?

35:58.615 --> 36:00.283
I'm full.

36:00.325 --> 36:01.910
- Is it fabulous?

36:00.325 --> 36:01.910
- Juliet, it doesn't suck.

36:01.952 --> 36:03.662
Let's hit

36:01.952 --> 36:03.662
The Alligator Lounge.

36:03.703 --> 36:05.455
Yes. Perfect. Zydeco music.

36:03.703 --> 36:05.455
You'll love this place.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.790
- Well, I'm--

36:05.497 --> 36:06.790
- What do you say, Marty?

36:06.832 --> 36:08.917
You up for

36:06.832 --> 36:08.917
a little Cajun craziness?

36:08.959 --> 36:11.294
Okay, I got it.

36:08.959 --> 36:11.294
Everybody owes 75 bucks.

36:11.336 --> 36:13.005
Pony up, please, so we can get

36:11.336 --> 36:13.005
the hell out of here.

36:13.046 --> 36:15.340
- Seventy-five?

36:13.046 --> 36:15.340
- I got you.

36:15.381 --> 36:16.842
Are you okay?

36:15.381 --> 36:16.842
Do you have enough?

36:16.883 --> 36:18.217
- Uh, I don't--

36:16.883 --> 36:18.217
- Hey. Don't sweat it, man.

36:18.259 --> 36:20.303
- I can cover you, too.

36:18.259 --> 36:20.303
- No, thanks.

36:20.345 --> 36:21.721
It's no big deal.

36:20.345 --> 36:21.721
I invited you. My treat.

36:21.763 --> 36:23.473
It's okay.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.475
I just need to find an ATM.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.475
I'll be right back.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.603
- Marty--

36:25.517 --> 36:28.603
- An ATM. My, how quaint.

36:28.645 --> 36:30.188
I'll be right back.

36:30.229 --> 36:31.982
- You okay?

36:30.229 --> 36:31.982
- Oh, yeah. No, I'm fine.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.775
I think I remember seeing

36:32.024 --> 36:33.775
a bank across the street

36:33.817 --> 36:35.485
so I'll go catch Marty.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.327
You couldn't find an ATM?

36:44.369 --> 36:47.747
Oh, no, there's at least six

36:44.369 --> 36:47.747
ATMs within a two block radius.

36:47.789 --> 36:49.166
And every single

36:47.789 --> 36:49.166
one of them is gonna tell me

36:49.207 --> 36:51.417
that I only have $18

36:49.207 --> 36:51.417
in my account.

36:51.459 --> 36:53.336
And then I believe

36:51.459 --> 36:53.336
they will flip me off.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.047
I think some of

36:53.378 --> 36:55.047
the more reputable banks

36:55.088 --> 36:56.464
have suspended

36:55.088 --> 36:56.464
their flipping-off policies.

36:56.506 --> 36:58.842
I can't go back in there.

36:56.506 --> 36:58.842
I can't leave.

36:58.884 --> 37:01.803
So here I stand.

36:58.884 --> 37:01.803
Frozen on the sidewalk.

37:01.845 --> 37:04.222
Here. I have some money.

37:04.263 --> 37:05.306
No.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.142
Marty, just take it.

37:07.184 --> 37:09.144
I'm not gonna

37:07.184 --> 37:09.144
take your money.

37:09.186 --> 37:11.188
Well, you're not gonna stand out

37:09.186 --> 37:11.188
here for the rest of the night.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.398
Why not?

37:13.439 --> 37:15.650
Because at the very least

37:13.439 --> 37:15.650
when all those guys

37:15.692 --> 37:16.943
come out of the restaurant,

37:15.692 --> 37:16.943
they'll see you.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.319
Come on. Please, Marty.

37:19.738 --> 37:20.989
Look, just say

37:19.738 --> 37:20.989
you found an ATM

37:21.031 --> 37:22.574
take the money,

37:21.031 --> 37:22.574
we'll go inside

37:22.615 --> 37:24.159
you'll hand it to the guys

37:22.615 --> 37:24.159
and then we'll leave.

37:24.201 --> 37:26.327
- You and me.

37:24.201 --> 37:26.327
- What about the Zydeco club?

37:26.369 --> 37:28.538
Well, I've never felt the need

37:26.369 --> 37:28.538
for Zydeco before in my life.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.498
No need to change that now.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.498
Come on, please?

37:32.542 --> 37:34.002
Yeah.

37:34.044 --> 37:35.837
And I thought getting

37:34.044 --> 37:35.837
pantsed at the prom

37:35.879 --> 37:37.672
was gonna be

37:35.879 --> 37:37.672
the low point in my life.

39:36.415 --> 39:37.416
I'll pay you back

39:36.415 --> 39:37.416
next weekend.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.127
Marty, please forget about it.

39:39.169 --> 39:41.004
I work a party Saturday night.

39:39.169 --> 39:41.004
I'll pay you on Sunday.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.464
There's a possibility

39:41.046 --> 39:43.464
it may all be in ones.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.550
I'm really sorry

39:43.506 --> 39:45.550
about tonight.

39:45.591 --> 39:47.344
There's no need

39:45.591 --> 39:47.344
to apologize.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.761
You want to come in?

39:48.803 --> 39:51.389
We still have

39:48.803 --> 39:51.389
a few movies left to watch.

39:51.430 --> 39:53.141
Rory..

39:53.183 --> 39:55.768
I feel like I really need

39:53.183 --> 39:55.768
to tell you something.

39:55.810 --> 39:56.895
Okay.

39:56.936 --> 39:58.771
Um..

39:58.813 --> 40:03.943
I know we're friends,

39:58.813 --> 40:03.943
and I'm glad we're friends.

40:03.985 --> 40:07.030
But...I don't want to be

40:03.985 --> 40:07.030
just friends anymore.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.115
'I like you.'

40:09.157 --> 40:11.368
I like...Logan.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.452
Yeah, I figured.

40:13.494 --> 40:14.954
I don't know why.

40:14.996 --> 40:17.415
Really? 'Cause I've

40:14.996 --> 40:17.415
got a few guesses.

40:17.456 --> 40:19.417
I'm sorry.

40:19.458 --> 40:21.711
Um, I don't know what to say.

40:21.753 --> 40:25.715
It's okay. You don't

40:21.753 --> 40:25.715
have to say anything.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.843
Are we still friends?

40:25.757 --> 40:28.843
Please say we're still friends.

40:28.885 --> 40:31.429
Sure.

40:28.885 --> 40:31.429
We're still friends.

40:31.470 --> 40:34.349
Please come back in. We can

40:31.470 --> 40:34.349
watch "Duck Soup" again, please?

40:34.391 --> 40:37.560
I don't really want to watch

40:34.391 --> 40:37.560
"Duck Soup" right now, Rory.

40:37.602 --> 40:39.520
I really like "Duck Soup"

40:39.562 --> 40:43.149
so I don't want it associated

40:39.562 --> 40:43.149
with this particular night.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.068
I understand.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.485
Yeah.

40:50.407 --> 40:52.409
I'll pay you back

40:50.407 --> 40:52.409
next weekend.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.410
Okay.

40:59.791 --> 41:00.875
[knock on window]

41:17.016 --> 41:18.017
Hey.

41:18.059 --> 41:19.394
Hey.

41:19.436 --> 41:20.519
Can I..?

41:20.561 --> 41:21.854
Yeah, sure.

41:27.777 --> 41:30.196
Huh. That move always

41:27.777 --> 41:30.196
seems cool in the movies.

41:30.238 --> 41:31.489
I think you maneuver

41:30.238 --> 41:31.489
your way

41:31.530 --> 41:32.991
through a window

41:31.530 --> 41:32.991
quite gracefully.

41:33.032 --> 41:34.033
Thank you.

41:34.075 --> 41:36.035
I assume

41:34.075 --> 41:36.035
you've had practice.

41:36.077 --> 41:37.703
No. First time.

41:37.745 --> 41:39.872
I'm sure.

41:39.914 --> 41:42.708
So, how was

41:39.914 --> 41:42.708
the Zydeco music?

41:42.750 --> 41:46.379
Uh, I left when Finn

41:42.750 --> 41:46.379
jumped in on vocals.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.423
Excellent self-preservational

41:46.421 --> 41:48.423
instincts.

41:49.924 --> 41:52.093
I just wanted to make sure

41:49.924 --> 41:52.093
you got home okay.

41:52.135 --> 41:53.803
Well, yeah. I got home okay.

41:53.845 --> 41:55.680
So I see.

41:55.721 --> 41:57.807
Thanks for the concern,

41:55.721 --> 41:57.807
I appreciate it.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.809
It wasn't all concern.

41:59.851 --> 42:00.935
Oh, really?

42:00.977 --> 42:02.728
No, I don't believe I said

42:02.770 --> 42:05.106
a proper goodnight

42:02.770 --> 42:05.106
to you this evening.

42:05.148 --> 42:06.732
No, you didn't.

42:06.774 --> 42:08.109
Goodnight, Ace.

42:19.662 --> 42:22.081
I thought you said

42:19.662 --> 42:22.081
a proper goodnight.

42:26.461 --> 42:28.796
You want to go get changed

42:26.461 --> 42:28.796
into something more comfortable?

42:28.838 --> 42:30.340
More comfortable

42:28.838 --> 42:30.340
than this?

42:30.382 --> 42:33.426
I actually was hoping

42:30.382 --> 42:33.426
for some feetsie pajamas.

42:33.468 --> 42:35.136
Oh, now you know I'm not

42:33.468 --> 42:35.136
that kind of girl.

42:45.980 --> 42:47.440
Do you want me to go?

42:51.110 --> 42:52.737
Rory, you want me to go?

42:52.778 --> 42:54.030
No.

42:54.072 --> 42:55.281
Okay, 'cause if you think

42:55.323 --> 42:57.283
climbing in that window

42:55.323 --> 42:57.283
was hard--

42:57.325 --> 42:58.784
Shh!
