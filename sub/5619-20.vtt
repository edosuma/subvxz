00:01.960 --> 00:04.381
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.464 --> 00:06.925
If I'm locked down on the base,
at least let me do something.

00:07.008 --> 00:09.010
The last time you helped wasn't helpful.

00:09.094 --> 00:11.304
You know I'm technically
your boss now, right?

00:11.388 --> 00:13.223
A good partner would've
seen that she was turned.

00:15.225 --> 00:16.309
None of us saw it.

00:16.434 --> 00:17.811
I'm not gonna fight you.

00:19.229 --> 00:22.691
So... Hive wants to turn any human
into an Inhuman,

00:22.774 --> 00:25.902
<i>regardless of that person's
existing genetic markers.</i>

00:27.112 --> 00:29.030
<i>You assured me this would work.</i>

00:29.114 --> 00:32.701
Yes, and it would have if I'd been
provided with the right ingredients.

00:32.784 --> 00:34.202
The DNA you need, I have it.

00:34.285 --> 00:35.995
So, if you want
this experiment to work...

00:37.497 --> 00:38.832
Drain me.

00:45.004 --> 00:47.799
<i>Still no word on
the whereabouts of Steve Rogers</i>

00:47.882 --> 00:50.510
<i>after his public feud
with Tony Stark and the Avengers</i>

00:50.593 --> 00:53.304
<i>over the controversial
Sokovia Accords.</i>

00:53.388 --> 00:55.598
<i>Ratified by 117 countries,</i>

00:55.682 --> 00:59.269
<i>the Accords place the Avengers
under UN authority</i>

00:59.352 --> 01:00.562
<i>and provide a framework</i>

01:00.645 --> 01:03.898
<i>for the registration and monitoring
of all Enhanced individuals.</i>

01:03.982 --> 01:06.985
We knew this was gonna happen
sooner or later.

01:07.444 --> 01:11.239
Cap, Agent Carter.
They were my heroes growing up.

01:12.031 --> 01:14.659
Both of them were there
at the beginning of S.H.I.E.L.D.

01:14.743 --> 01:16.494
Now we may be there when it ends.

01:16.578 --> 01:17.954
The last thing we need right now

01:18.037 --> 01:20.582
is the government hamstringing us
with the Accords.

01:20.665 --> 01:23.251
We need to stop Hive
by any means necessary.

01:23.334 --> 01:24.878
I'll deal with the government.

01:24.961 --> 01:26.588
You do whatever it takes to end this.

01:26.671 --> 01:28.590
All options on the table?

01:28.673 --> 01:30.467
Desperate times, desperate measures.

01:32.385 --> 01:34.596
You might want to go out the back.
He's coming in.

01:42.103 --> 01:44.689
General Talbot. Right on time.

01:44.773 --> 01:46.191
What in the Knievel happened to you?

01:47.066 --> 01:49.319
Little fender bender. No big deal.

01:49.402 --> 01:51.863
You sure you should be
in the driver's seat?

01:51.946 --> 01:53.573
I thought we agreed on full disclosure.

01:53.656 --> 01:54.949
You want to see my X-rays?

01:55.033 --> 01:56.910
I'll put them in a nice frame for you.

01:56.993 --> 02:00.663
I'm talking about this gin joint
out in the middle of no-man's-land.

02:00.747 --> 02:01.915
You promised me
you'd show me the base

02:01.998 --> 02:04.751
without any three-hour
fly-arounds this time.

02:04.834 --> 02:07.003
We need to talk first.

02:07.086 --> 02:09.964
I'll talk. You listen.

02:16.846 --> 02:19.516
I'm here because
the President sent me.

02:19.599 --> 02:21.768
The Sokovia Accords
are law of the land now.

02:21.851 --> 02:23.311
And he's concerned
you may have some

02:23.394 --> 02:26.189
undocumented Enhanced assets
working for you.

02:26.272 --> 02:27.482
And why would he think that?

02:27.565 --> 02:28.858
Because he's not a moron.

02:28.942 --> 02:31.110
Come on, Phil.

02:31.194 --> 02:34.322
It's time for S.H.I.E.L.D. to come in
from the cold, relegitimise.

02:34.405 --> 02:36.699
In exchange for revealing
and registering

02:36.783 --> 02:38.743
any Inhumans we may have?

02:38.827 --> 02:39.911
Not gonna happen.

02:39.994 --> 02:43.122
Why are you so pigheaded?

02:43.873 --> 02:45.166
It's good enough for the Avengers.

02:45.250 --> 02:46.918
Not all of them.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.170
And the Avengers operate
in the spotlight.

02:49.254 --> 02:50.588
We work in the shadows.

02:50.672 --> 02:52.131
What's going on
in those shadows, Phil?

02:52.215 --> 02:53.675
That's what I want to know.

02:53.758 --> 02:55.760
You better start opening some doors,

02:55.844 --> 02:58.388
or I promise you,
I'm gonna start kicking them down.

02:59.430 --> 03:00.807
All right.

03:01.391 --> 03:02.684
Let's go for a ride.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.018
No blindfold?

03:04.102 --> 03:05.687
No blindfold,

03:05.770 --> 03:07.730
but you might want to buckle up.

03:08.481 --> 03:09.774
What?

03:27.792 --> 03:29.919
You're getting better, Fitz,

03:30.003 --> 03:31.838
but I designed
the anti-subversion code,

03:31.921 --> 03:34.674
so it's only a matter of time until...

03:36.384 --> 03:37.802
I'm in.

03:37.886 --> 03:38.928
Huh.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.683
Interesting.

03:47.478 --> 03:49.147
They still have got you locked up.

03:49.230 --> 03:51.524
Was somebody being a bad boy?

03:51.608 --> 03:53.234
You like the bad boys.

03:55.528 --> 03:56.738
We have a history.

03:58.031 --> 04:00.241
I thought we had a future once,

04:01.534 --> 04:03.494
but I gave him his chance
and he refused,

04:03.578 --> 04:06.080
so now I just feel sorry for him.

04:06.372 --> 04:07.415
Ah...

04:08.291 --> 04:09.709
Damn it, Fitz.

04:10.710 --> 04:12.795
Your friends are very persistent.

04:13.338 --> 04:16.632
They keep finding us,
forcing us to move,

04:16.716 --> 04:18.718
wasting valuable time.

04:18.801 --> 04:20.637
If it happens again,

04:21.721 --> 04:23.640
there'll be no absolution.

04:23.723 --> 04:25.058
It won't.

04:25.350 --> 04:27.018
Fitz is on the losing end of this.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.854
We'll get back into the system,
and we'll know every move they make.

04:29.938 --> 04:31.940
How's our patient?

04:37.320 --> 04:40.698
I'm fine, except for the bright light
shining in my eye.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.663
I think that's enough for one day.

04:48.081 --> 04:50.583
Don't want to kill the golden goose.

04:50.667 --> 04:51.960
Just take it easy.

04:53.419 --> 04:56.172
You just drink this and get some rest.

04:56.714 --> 04:58.091
No, that.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.218
I think you're the one who needs rest.

05:00.301 --> 05:03.179
Well, we'll rest when we're dead.

05:03.262 --> 05:04.889
Not you. I didn't mean...

05:04.973 --> 05:07.016
It's just a phrase.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.102
No need for any deaths.

05:11.396 --> 05:12.897
We're ready for the alpha test.

05:18.820 --> 05:21.114
You were confident the last time.

05:21.197 --> 05:22.657
True.

05:22.740 --> 05:25.576
But this time,
we have all the right ingredients.

05:25.743 --> 05:28.871
We just need to find some volunteers.

05:29.247 --> 05:32.291
I'm recruiting some. Special ones.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.419
A little gift for Daisy.

05:39.090 --> 05:40.717
Time for your feeding.

05:41.217 --> 05:43.136
Your sense of humour needs work.

05:43.469 --> 05:46.055
How much longer are you gonna keep
me locked up in here? It's been days.

05:46.139 --> 05:49.225
As long as it takes. Your immune
system is still compromised.

05:49.308 --> 05:50.768
There's nothing wrong with me.

05:50.852 --> 05:52.812
And losing Daisy
has made you irrational.

05:52.895 --> 05:56.482
Everything you've done to try
to help her has made things worse.

05:56.566 --> 05:58.526
Doesn't give you the right
to keep me locked up.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.528
You want to leave?

06:00.611 --> 06:02.989
We can hand you over
to General Talbot right now.

06:03.072 --> 06:05.491
- He's right upstairs.
- He's here?

06:06.743 --> 06:09.370
- Why?
- To take inventory.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.373
You really want to help Daisy?

06:12.457 --> 06:15.168
Then you need to
straighten up and fly right.

06:16.127 --> 06:17.879
And eat something.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.225
He's lucky we're feeding him at all.

06:31.309 --> 06:33.394
Doesn't even need to be there.
He's fine now.

06:33.478 --> 06:35.354
Coulson wants him locked up.

06:35.438 --> 06:37.065
We destroyed all our work
on the Hive cure,

06:37.148 --> 06:40.276
and now you have to spend
all your time Daisy-proofing security.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.070
Yeah. Believe me, I know.

06:42.153 --> 06:44.155
It's like whack-a-mole.

06:44.781 --> 06:47.033
Knock her out of one hole,
she just pops back up into another.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.453
Could really use Mack's help.

06:50.536 --> 06:51.621
How is he?

06:51.704 --> 06:53.414
Well, stress fractures are healing.

06:53.498 --> 06:55.333
Broken ribs and fingers still need time.

06:55.416 --> 06:58.252
It's his broken spirit that worries me.

06:58.336 --> 07:01.380
He hasn't been the same since Daisy...

07:01.464 --> 07:02.548
Feels like everything's going to hell

07:02.632 --> 07:05.426
and all we're doing
is slowing down the descent.

07:06.636 --> 07:07.720
Okay.

07:07.804 --> 07:10.056
That should keep her out for an hour.

07:10.139 --> 07:11.599
Or a minute.

07:13.226 --> 07:14.310
Any plans?

07:14.393 --> 07:15.728
Yeah.

07:21.067 --> 07:22.777
I need you to forget about Daisy.

07:22.860 --> 07:26.322
She already knows everything about us,
and she's going to get in eventually.

07:26.405 --> 07:29.117
Time to stop playing defence
and get back on offence.

07:30.034 --> 07:32.245
I need you to start thinking like Hive.

07:32.328 --> 07:34.122
Get inside his twisted brain.

07:34.872 --> 07:36.541
What drives him? What does he want?

07:36.624 --> 07:37.875
He's a parasite.

07:37.959 --> 07:39.669
All he wants to do is consume.

07:39.752 --> 07:42.046
But he also has humans
in there somewhere,

07:42.130 --> 07:44.173
and you've spent significant time
with two of them.

07:44.257 --> 07:46.217
We need to know his endgame,

07:46.300 --> 07:48.803
and we need to know it yesterday.

07:49.637 --> 07:50.680
Son of a gun.

07:50.763 --> 07:53.015
Right under my nose this whole time,

07:53.099 --> 07:55.351
like a pack of sewer rats.

07:55.434 --> 07:57.436
I didn't even know
this SSR base existed.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.230
It was never on the books.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.607
I'd like to keep it that way.

08:01.899 --> 08:04.152
I'm trusting you with our biggest secret.

08:04.235 --> 08:06.487
Now I need you to trust me.

08:06.571 --> 08:08.281
Don't report our Inhumans.

08:08.364 --> 08:10.867
Some battles need to be fought
with secret warriors.

08:10.950 --> 08:12.368
How many you got?

08:12.451 --> 08:14.287
I know about Daisy and Electro-Boy.

08:14.370 --> 08:15.413
Who else?

08:15.496 --> 08:17.081
You're about to meet one.

08:17.165 --> 08:19.083
Welcome back, Ms Rodriguez.

08:20.168 --> 08:21.502
Director Coulson.

08:21.586 --> 08:24.755
Mack couldn't be here.
He sends his regards.

08:24.839 --> 08:27.133
This is Brigadier General Talbot,
acting head of the ATCU.

08:27.216 --> 08:28.718
- Here's here to...
- I know why.

08:28.801 --> 08:29.969
I watch the news.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.054
We found Ms Rodriguez in Colombia.

08:32.138 --> 08:34.724
She was being a real thorn
in the side of the drug cartels,

08:34.807 --> 08:36.558
using her powers
to clean up her neighbourhood,

08:36.642 --> 08:38.144
to fight the good fight.

08:38.227 --> 08:39.812
Put me on your list,

08:39.895 --> 08:41.105
there will be a price on my head.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.773
Nobody would ever find out about it.

08:46.819 --> 08:48.863
- I think that means...
- I know what she's saying.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.281
What are her powers?

08:50.364 --> 08:51.574
Elena.

08:52.450 --> 08:54.619
The General would like to see
what you can do.

08:57.622 --> 08:58.956
Any time.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.135
Thank you.

09:12.845 --> 09:14.513
So, she's really fast.

09:14.597 --> 09:15.973
Fast, yeah.

09:16.057 --> 09:17.558
And she can fend for herself.

09:17.642 --> 09:18.976
Not all Inhumans can.

09:19.060 --> 09:20.269
Most of them are regular people

09:20.353 --> 09:23.564
with lives and families
who just want to be left alone.

09:23.648 --> 09:24.690
If you force them to register...

09:24.774 --> 09:26.525
It's a protected list.

09:26.609 --> 09:28.736
It's highly classified.
You had an index...

09:28.819 --> 09:32.365
Which is why I know nothing good
ever comes from putting people on lists.

09:32.448 --> 09:34.116
Eventually they get misused,

09:34.200 --> 09:35.743
or fall into the wrong hands,

09:35.826 --> 09:38.287
and then innocent people suffer.

09:46.504 --> 09:48.631
It's not a bad bunch, but we need more.

09:48.714 --> 09:49.757
Recruitment's getting harder.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.218
People think the Sokovia Accords
will solve everything.

09:52.301 --> 09:53.803
The Sokovia Accords are a joke.

09:53.886 --> 09:55.346
We don't need registration.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.348
We need extermination.

09:57.807 --> 10:00.226
I have a new informant in the ATCU.

10:00.309 --> 10:02.937
Gave me the name
of someone on their list.

10:03.646 --> 10:06.065
We can make an example of this one.

10:06.148 --> 10:09.151
The world needs to know
that Inhumans are a disease,

10:09.235 --> 10:10.820
and we're the only cure.

10:10.903 --> 10:13.281
Fire!

10:26.669 --> 10:29.463
Daisy, are you listening?

10:30.756 --> 10:34.176
I know if there's a way
to get in here, you'll find it.

10:34.260 --> 10:36.304
So if you are listening,

10:37.263 --> 10:39.181
I need to talk to you.

10:39.849 --> 10:41.600
I want to see you.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.956
<i>You can move now.</i>

11:07.209 --> 11:08.377
<i>I made a loop of you sleeping,</i>

11:08.461 --> 11:11.380
<i>so if anyone checks the monitor,
that's all they'll see.</i>

11:11.464 --> 11:13.382
<i>We can talk privately.</i>

11:14.717 --> 11:16.844
It's good to see you.

11:18.596 --> 11:20.056
Are you okay?

11:20.139 --> 11:21.766
<i>Fine.</i>

11:21.849 --> 11:23.893
<i>Just feeling a little drained.</i>

11:23.976 --> 11:26.437
<i>What about you?
Why are you locked up?</i>

11:27.480 --> 11:30.775
Honestly, they don't trust me.

11:32.318 --> 11:34.111
They think I've lost my mind over you.

11:36.113 --> 11:37.615
Well, is it true?

11:38.616 --> 11:41.035
<i>You know you're the only reason
I was ever here.</i>

11:41.118 --> 11:42.453
<i>And they know it.
Now that you're gone...</i>

11:42.536 --> 11:44.372
I gave you a chance to come with me.

11:44.455 --> 11:46.374
<i>We could be together right now,
but you said no.</i>

11:46.457 --> 11:48.167
I said no to being brainwashed.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.835
I don't want to be with you that way.

11:49.919 --> 11:52.004
<i>Do I sound brainwashed to you?</i>

11:52.630 --> 11:54.131
I don't know.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.050
I just...

11:56.675 --> 11:58.677
I just want to be with you.

11:59.845 --> 12:01.555
<i>No Hive, no S.H.I.E.L.D., just...</i>

12:01.639 --> 12:03.474
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

12:04.392 --> 12:07.061
<i>Alone and away from everything,</i>

12:07.144 --> 12:09.063
just seeing the world.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.066
I don't even know if that's possible.

12:15.361 --> 12:17.905
Hold that thought.

12:17.988 --> 12:20.032
We'll have to talk later.
You've got company.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.617
When can we talk again?

12:21.700 --> 12:23.035
<i>I got to go. Fast. I miss you.</i>

12:23.160 --> 12:24.453
<i>Get back in bed and I'll cut the feed</i>

12:24.537 --> 12:27.915
<i>in three, two, one.</i>

12:31.502 --> 12:32.795
Well, well, well.

12:32.878 --> 12:35.714
If it isn't the hothead
that tried to kill my bodyguard.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.466
What's he doing in here?

12:37.550 --> 12:39.593
I thought this was a germ-free zone.

12:39.677 --> 12:42.346
I see you two remember each other.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.475
You're not happy to see me.

12:46.559 --> 12:48.310
No, I'm not.

12:48.394 --> 12:50.688
Why are you being like this?

12:50.771 --> 12:52.565
I came here to fight,

12:52.690 --> 12:54.191
to save Daisy.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.070
Because it's a fight we can't win.

12:58.696 --> 12:59.947
What happened to you?

13:00.030 --> 13:01.240
Daisy.

13:02.241 --> 13:04.743
She lost her soul to that thing.

13:05.536 --> 13:10.207
I don't want what happened to her
to happen to someone else I care about.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.636
The sway or whatever he does to them,

13:22.720 --> 13:26.348
it's not even the worst thing
that's gonna happen.

13:26.432 --> 13:28.934
- No?
- No.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.394
What is?

13:31.395 --> 13:33.063
Armageddon.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.442
Whatever he's doing is pure evil.

13:36.567 --> 13:41.697
I'm talking end-times, Biblical evil,
2,000-years-of-darkness evil.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.491
You need a beer.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.076
And some faith.

13:46.911 --> 13:47.912
Hmm.

13:49.747 --> 13:53.584
You ever wonder if that's
a word we use to fool ourselves?

13:53.918 --> 13:56.420
You know, give us false hope?

13:57.421 --> 13:59.256
That's how evil wins.

14:00.174 --> 14:02.801
When good people begin to, uh,

14:04.803 --> 14:07.640
doubt and run the other way,

14:07.765 --> 14:10.100
instead of stand up and fight.

14:10.184 --> 14:12.102
You see it everywhere.

14:12.186 --> 14:13.812
In Colombia, we have a saying.

14:23.447 --> 14:28.160
"Evil preys on the weak
because it fears the strong."

14:38.462 --> 14:40.714
The guy in the black hoodie.
That was him.

14:40.798 --> 14:42.591
We want him alive.

14:42.675 --> 14:45.177
Save all the fun
till we're back at the base.

14:48.806 --> 14:51.267
<i>This is exactly why
we need the Accords.</i>

14:51.350 --> 14:52.434
It's about protection.

14:52.518 --> 14:54.353
- Whose protection?
- Everyone's.

14:54.478 --> 14:57.147
People need to be protected
when one of you runs amok.

14:57.231 --> 14:59.692
Some of you
need protection from yourselves.

14:59.817 --> 15:01.360
Is that why you have him caged up?

15:01.485 --> 15:03.195
He's under medical observation,
General.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.781
I've seen him in the field.
He has control issues.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.157
Lethal control issues.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.618
Issues that S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
uniquely qualified to help him with.

15:09.702 --> 15:11.495
How does this registration work?

15:11.829 --> 15:13.706
You put us on a list. Then what?

15:13.831 --> 15:15.708
Fingerprints, DNA samples.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.294
We run a power analysis
to categorise your threat level.

15:18.377 --> 15:20.671
Also used to determine health risks.

15:20.754 --> 15:21.839
Fine.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.716
I'll register. Sign me up.

15:23.841 --> 15:24.967
I don't think that's a good idea.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.344
I don't think keeping me locked up
is a good idea, either.

15:27.428 --> 15:28.512
Get me the hell out of here,

15:28.596 --> 15:31.015
and I'll register and tell you
anything you want to know.

15:31.515 --> 15:33.642
It's in everyone's best interest
to keep him here right now.

15:33.726 --> 15:35.060
Not mine.

15:35.853 --> 15:37.271
If you're in here against your will,

15:37.354 --> 15:41.400
what's keeping you from just zapping
the two of us right now?

15:41.525 --> 15:43.027
Absolutely nothing.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.362
I could fry that moustache
right off your face.

15:45.446 --> 15:47.114
But that's just not who I am.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.991
Besides, I'd never make it off the base.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.784
Not without help.

15:53.203 --> 15:56.290
All right, Coulson.
I've seen the good and the bad.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.250
Now show me the ugly.

16:09.595 --> 16:11.388
What the hell is that?

16:11.472 --> 16:13.599
You're keeping monsters
on your base now?

16:13.724 --> 16:14.725
Breathe, General.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.561
It was Dr Garner
before he changed permanently.

16:19.772 --> 16:22.024
Rasta-Hulk is your husband?

16:22.107 --> 16:23.692
I don't care if that thing
used to be Gandhi.

16:23.776 --> 16:26.278
Why on God's crusty pie is it here?

16:26.403 --> 16:29.114
It needs to be frozen
in a Gel-Matrix Cube.

16:29.239 --> 16:31.116
- He may prove to be an asset.
- An asset?

16:31.241 --> 16:35.037
What you have is an out-of-control
freak show down here, Coulson.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.997
What other surprises
have you got for me?

16:37.081 --> 16:38.332
This is it.

16:38.415 --> 16:41.001
You wanted open doors. You got them.

16:44.672 --> 16:45.964
<i>Lincoln.</i>

16:48.008 --> 16:49.343
<i>Do you really want to leave?</i>

16:49.927 --> 16:51.762
Only if I can see you.

16:52.638 --> 16:53.847
<i>Where's Daisy Johnson?</i>

16:53.931 --> 16:55.432
She's on assignment.

16:56.809 --> 16:58.102
On assignment for who?

17:01.605 --> 17:03.232
I've got satellite imagery here

17:03.315 --> 17:06.859
of her and a dead man
strolling down lover's lane

17:06.944 --> 17:10.364
in a town where an unidentified object
crashed the night before.

17:10.446 --> 17:13.784
If you knew this the whole time,
why'd you wait until now to show me?

17:15.285 --> 17:17.663
Phil, I wanted to see
if you'd lie to my face.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.165
I had no choice.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.625
The stakes were too high.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.295
What are you up against?

17:25.628 --> 17:26.964
What is at stake?

17:27.297 --> 17:29.133
The world as we know it.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.285
End of the line, Inhuman.

17:56.368 --> 17:57.995
There's nowhere left to run.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.876
I suppose there's always hell.

18:13.886 --> 18:15.012
Well, look at that.

18:15.846 --> 18:17.473
A real hot dog.

18:17.556 --> 18:22.811
But seriously, who follows a stranger
down a dark alley dressed as pups?

18:22.895 --> 18:26.023
I mean, on principle alone,
I can't let this end well for you.

18:29.568 --> 18:31.528
Leaving so soon?

18:31.612 --> 18:34.198
- Who are you?
- I'm the one who invited you.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.410
But, as you can tell,
I'm not with the ATCU.

18:38.535 --> 18:39.912
What did you want from us?

18:40.579 --> 18:42.706
I want you to become what you hate.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.553
The devil?

18:58.806 --> 19:00.682
You must be kidding me.

19:00.766 --> 19:02.309
Technically,

19:02.392 --> 19:03.769
it's not the devil,

19:03.894 --> 19:05.729
but many of the myths about the devil

19:06.480 --> 19:09.274
are derived from Hive and the cults
that worshipped him as Hydra.

19:09.942 --> 19:13.195
You're saying a demon
possessed Grant Ward.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.321
It's not <i>The Exorcist.</i>

19:14.404 --> 19:16.740
There's nothing demonic about Hive.
He's an Inhuman.

19:16.824 --> 19:19.493
An Inhuman who's made up of
an indeterminable amount

19:19.576 --> 19:20.619
of nanoparasites.

19:20.786 --> 19:25.415
Those nanoparasites can consume
human flesh upon contact,

19:25.499 --> 19:27.668
but when they make
contact with Inhumans,

19:27.751 --> 19:30.379
they attack the pleasure centres
of the brain,

19:30.462 --> 19:32.798
giving its victims
a desire and willingness

19:32.923 --> 19:35.425
to connect with Hive and to serve him.

19:35.509 --> 19:37.594
So he's controlling Daisy. Is that it?

19:37.678 --> 19:38.720
That's it.

19:38.804 --> 19:41.682
This is exactly why
the Sokovia Accords were created.

19:41.765 --> 19:43.559
This is a nightmare scenario.

19:43.642 --> 19:45.936
She's a nuclear weapon
in the wrong hands.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.984
How many of these Inhumans
is he controlling?

19:52.109 --> 19:56.113
Not many. He tried to create his own,
but we rained on that parade.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.531
We did.

19:57.614 --> 20:01.994
But, sir, he may actually
have everything he needs now.

20:05.664 --> 20:07.624
All cards on the table, Dr Simmons.

20:07.708 --> 20:10.127
I want General Talbot
on the same page as the rest of us.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.713
All right, well, we've been trying
to put the pieces together

20:12.796 --> 20:14.631
to determine possible
endgame scenarios.

20:14.715 --> 20:16.091
We know he wanted Kree blood

20:16.174 --> 20:18.343
so he can duplicate
the original Kree experiment.

20:18.468 --> 20:20.721
That's turning a human
into an Inhuman.

20:20.804 --> 20:23.599
The Kree were destroyed.
May and Mack made sure of that.

20:23.682 --> 20:24.766
There's no more Kree blood.

20:24.850 --> 20:27.311
Yes, there is.
You have it, and so does Daisy.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.146
He can use her blood.

20:30.981 --> 20:34.151
So, just take some of Daisy's blood
and make more of these...

20:34.234 --> 20:35.903
You know how crazy this sounds, right?

20:35.986 --> 20:37.613
But that would kill her.

20:37.696 --> 20:40.657
Do you really think he'd sacrifice her
just to make a few more Inhumans?

20:40.782 --> 20:43.827
With her powers, her knowledge,
she's worth 100.

20:43.952 --> 20:45.829
What if he could make that many?

20:45.954 --> 20:48.582
With enough of Daisy's blood,
the Terrigen Crystals they have,

20:48.665 --> 20:50.083
Hive's own particulate DNA,

20:50.167 --> 20:52.044
and a scientist
who knows how to stir the cocktail...

20:52.169 --> 20:56.256
He could create an all-in-one virus
that instantly transforms any humans

20:56.340 --> 20:59.843
into swayed Inhumans,
completely under his control.

21:05.682 --> 21:07.851
Move along, little puppies.

21:12.189 --> 21:14.066
These are volunteers?

21:14.191 --> 21:16.318
Sometimes they need
a little extra motivation.

21:16.401 --> 21:17.903
Do whatever you want to us.

21:18.028 --> 21:20.280
It doesn't change the fact
that you're all abominations!

21:21.823 --> 21:26.036
Shut your blowhole, preacher.
You're about to join the evolution.

21:29.373 --> 21:31.750
Their lives have been filled
with such hatred.

21:31.875 --> 21:34.419
Now they'll find peace with us.

21:34.544 --> 21:35.837
They don't deserve it.

21:37.005 --> 21:40.008
Every human deserves a chance
to be freed from his prison.

21:40.092 --> 21:43.220
Their emancipation will be
my gift to you.

21:45.389 --> 21:47.224
Are you still confident?

21:48.392 --> 21:50.727
100% fairly certain.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.296
Now we wait.

22:20.924 --> 22:22.384
Have you accessed
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s security system?

22:22.467 --> 22:25.012
I'm in. I found their weak spot.

22:25.095 --> 22:27.264
Good. Keep me updated.

22:27.764 --> 22:29.057
But, please, rest.

22:30.934 --> 22:32.811
We may need some more blood.

22:41.945 --> 22:43.739
<i>It's time. Are you ready?</i>

22:43.822 --> 22:45.323
<i>Let's do it.</i>

22:45.449 --> 22:46.867
Okay.

22:46.950 --> 22:49.661
I'm limited in what I can do,
so this is gonna be a team effort.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.329
<i>First, we have to get you out of there,</i>

22:51.455 --> 22:52.998
<i>but Fitz closed the loopholes
after I escaped,</i>

22:53.123 --> 22:55.417
<i>so I can't open the door,
but we can still</i> MacGyver <i>you out.</i>

22:58.670 --> 23:00.005
I can handle this.

23:00.130 --> 23:02.883
<i>No, no, no. Stop.
I said</i> MacGyver, <i>not</i> Firestarter.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.384
<i>Zapping it will trigger the alarms.</i>

23:04.468 --> 23:05.761
<i>We have to open it while tricking it</i>

23:05.844 --> 23:07.679
<i>into thinking it's closed
at the same time.</i>

23:08.472 --> 23:11.183
Okay, let's see
what we have to work with.

23:11.308 --> 23:14.478
Okay, you're gonna need
that tape dispenser,

23:15.979 --> 23:17.314
<i>a pencil,</i>

23:18.273 --> 23:20.317
<i>your food tray,
and a piece of that mirror.</i>

23:24.988 --> 23:26.823
Do you have any idea how to stop him?

23:26.948 --> 23:28.533
I mean, you make him sound invincible.

23:28.658 --> 23:30.952
Calm down, General,
you'll pull something.

23:31.036 --> 23:33.622
"Calm down?"
This is an end-of-the-world type deal.

23:33.705 --> 23:35.082
Don't you tell me to calm down.

23:35.165 --> 23:37.501
I'm the one that tells you to calm down.

23:39.002 --> 23:40.420
How are you so calm, anyway?

23:40.504 --> 23:42.756
I'm getting used to this sort of thing.

23:42.839 --> 23:44.382
<i>Okay, here's what you need to do.</i>

23:44.508 --> 23:47.928
<i>You see that laser circuit in the back?
You need to interrupt it with the mirror.</i>

23:48.011 --> 23:49.221
<i>Don't touch anything else.</i>

23:51.181 --> 23:53.350
<i>Okay, hold it there.</i>

23:54.810 --> 23:56.812
<i>Now, plug in the spool
from the tape dispenser.</i>

23:57.020 --> 24:00.315
<i>Perfect. Now, remove the pencil
and grab the food tray.</i>

24:00.398 --> 24:02.317
<i>I'll be monitoring you
through the surveillance camera.</i>

24:02.400 --> 24:05.529
<i>When the door opens, you'll have
three minutes to get to the exit point.</i>

24:05.654 --> 24:06.655
<i>Get ready.</i>

24:06.738 --> 24:07.906
What's the tray for?

24:08.031 --> 24:09.157
<i>Him.</i>

24:12.369 --> 24:14.371
<i>Now grab his comms.</i>

24:14.496 --> 24:16.123
<i>We're exploring
some options.</i>

24:16.206 --> 24:18.041
"Options?"

24:18.166 --> 24:19.584
That's what you've got?

24:19.709 --> 24:22.379
You told me this thing
could take out an entire planet.

24:22.504 --> 24:23.755
I got an option for you.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.257
A preemptive strike.

24:25.382 --> 24:26.842
This isn't a job for S.H.I.E.L.D.

24:26.925 --> 24:28.802
This is a job
for the United States military.

24:28.885 --> 24:30.720
You want to make that call? Go ahead.

24:30.846 --> 24:32.472
But you'll probably lose them at "devil."

24:32.556 --> 24:34.724
Do you think I'm an idiot?

24:36.893 --> 24:38.562
I wouldn't tell them the truth.

24:38.687 --> 24:40.438
Even if they could be convinced,

24:40.564 --> 24:43.108
by the time we dealt with
all their second-guessing and red tape,

24:43.233 --> 24:45.277
whatever Hive's planning
would already be done.

24:53.118 --> 24:54.578
Am I clear?

24:57.080 --> 24:59.124
Lincoln, hold. May's coming.

24:59.749 --> 25:02.085
<i>Where? I don't see her.</i>

25:02.210 --> 25:04.087
She's approaching the intersection.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.964
<i>Hang tight. I'll distract her.</i>

25:15.807 --> 25:17.726
<i>Now. Lincoln, go now.</i>

25:24.316 --> 25:27.485
<i>Okay, you're in the clear.
Proceed to the exit point.</i>

25:27.611 --> 25:29.905
We shouldn't act without knowing
the last piece of the puzzle.

25:29.988 --> 25:32.908
Hive and his hole-in-the-wall gang
recently stole something

25:32.991 --> 25:35.619
from an ATCU facility in Indiana.

25:37.954 --> 25:39.414
Till we find out what that is...

25:40.832 --> 25:43.293
Acting without all the information
could make things worse.

25:43.418 --> 25:45.212
It could be what Hive wants.

25:45.295 --> 25:47.172
He was the only thing
to survive on that planet,

25:47.297 --> 25:49.716
and he survived for a reason.

25:49.799 --> 25:50.967
So, what do you want me to do?

25:51.092 --> 25:52.427
Trust us.

25:56.181 --> 25:58.058
Oh, Daisy's back in the system.

25:58.141 --> 26:00.685
She circumnavigated
the anti-subversion code

26:00.810 --> 26:02.854
and gained access to Lincoln.

26:04.147 --> 26:05.899
That boy sure sleeps a lot.

26:05.982 --> 26:07.359
Unless...

26:11.988 --> 26:14.032
It's a pre-recorded loop.

26:14.658 --> 26:15.825
- Hey.
- You're all right.

26:15.951 --> 26:17.994
You're all right. Help is on its way.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.331
Trust you?

26:33.677 --> 26:35.011
Oh, my God.

26:35.679 --> 26:37.013
What have I done?

26:40.517 --> 26:42.519
I think you overcooked them, Doc.

26:46.356 --> 26:49.985
How can I trust you when you can't
even keep track of your own Inhumans?

26:50.068 --> 26:51.236
That's two of them you've lost.

26:51.361 --> 26:52.779
I should've left you in the bar.

26:52.862 --> 26:54.322
- What's happening?
- Hothead is loose,

26:54.406 --> 26:56.116
and he's getting help
from Swazy Daisy.

26:56.199 --> 26:57.826
He's not going anywhere.

26:57.909 --> 27:00.954
The base is sealed and Fitz is freezing
her out of the lockdown protocol.

27:01.037 --> 27:02.247
There's still another way.

27:02.372 --> 27:03.415
The way you two came in.

27:03.540 --> 27:05.959
Nobody knows about that except you,
me, and now General Talbot.

27:06.042 --> 27:07.168
Are you sure?

27:08.211 --> 27:09.963
Go check it out. Make sure it's secure.

27:10.046 --> 27:11.172
Come with me.

27:12.507 --> 27:14.968
I'm sorry, Phil,
but I got to loop in the President.

27:15.051 --> 27:17.012
Give us some time. We'll find him.

27:23.893 --> 27:25.437
Another dead end. What's going on?

27:25.562 --> 27:27.981
Fitz, he's taken full control
of the lockdown.

27:28.064 --> 27:29.316
I'm trapped in here?

27:29.399 --> 27:30.817
<i>Relax. I'll get you out.</i>

27:30.900 --> 27:31.985
Yeah.

27:32.068 --> 27:33.653
Hopefully not in a body bag.

27:33.737 --> 27:38.158
I need the blue disc in port seven
and gold disc in port four.

27:38.241 --> 27:39.409
Could you use an extra hand?

27:39.534 --> 27:40.577
Mack!

27:40.660 --> 27:42.495
Uh, well, actually, I could use
about seven, but one will do.

27:42.579 --> 27:45.081
I need you to put these in bay eight.

27:45.206 --> 27:46.249
Sorry.

27:46.333 --> 27:48.418
Are we giving her the runaround,
or is she giving it to us?

27:48.543 --> 27:50.670
I think it's a bit of both.

27:50.754 --> 27:53.173
All right, rebooting in three,

27:53.715 --> 27:54.924
two,

27:55.050 --> 27:56.426
one.

27:58.345 --> 27:59.346
Okay.

27:59.429 --> 28:01.765
There's no way he's getting off
this base unless he learns to fly.

28:02.682 --> 28:04.184
Actually, Daisy could fly him out.

28:04.267 --> 28:05.352
She's nowhere near here.

28:05.435 --> 28:08.188
If she hacked into the Quinjet systems
and reprogrammed them for autopilot,

28:08.271 --> 28:09.439
she can fly him out
from anywhere in the world.

28:10.607 --> 28:12.192
I spent so much time
trying to secure the base,

28:12.275 --> 28:14.694
I didn't even think about the Quinjet.

28:18.948 --> 28:20.617
She's locked us out.

28:21.284 --> 28:23.286
Okay, I'm on it.

28:33.213 --> 28:34.381
I'm in.

28:34.464 --> 28:35.548
Are we all clear up there?

28:35.632 --> 28:37.967
There's a problem. I can't access
the camera on the upper deck.

28:38.051 --> 28:39.386
<i>It may be having some issues.</i>

28:39.469 --> 28:40.970
I made it this far.

28:41.054 --> 28:42.305
I'm not stopping now.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.808
<i>I won't have eyes up there, Lincoln.
You'll be on your own.</i>

28:48.228 --> 28:49.979
Looks clear to me.

28:56.277 --> 28:58.488
Can't let you leave, Sparks.

28:59.989 --> 29:01.324
Let me go.

29:01.408 --> 29:02.575
I got to get to Daisy.

29:02.659 --> 29:03.827
You're on a fool's errand.

29:03.952 --> 29:06.329
The only reason she's helping you
is so Hive can make you one of them.

29:06.454 --> 29:08.581
No, Mack, you don't understand.

29:08.665 --> 29:09.833
I need to go.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.918
I'll keep your arms pinned down
all day if I have to.

29:12.001 --> 29:14.254
Don't make me do this!

29:18.341 --> 29:20.343
<i>Lincoln? Lincoln, are you there?</i>

29:20.427 --> 29:21.511
You still there?

29:21.594 --> 29:22.595
<i>What happened? I lost you.</i>

29:22.679 --> 29:24.848
<i>You didn't lose me. Just a little
complication. We're good to go.</i>

29:24.973 --> 29:27.809
Okay, get to one of the Quinjets,
and I'll do the rest.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.688
I don't...

29:31.771 --> 29:33.314
It should've worked.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.487
Remove your restraints.

29:44.033 --> 29:46.453
Those are some nicely trained puppies.

29:48.705 --> 29:50.039
Bring me Dr Radcliffe.

29:50.165 --> 29:51.458
Look, this is just science.

29:51.541 --> 29:53.293
I'm gonna have to look at the data

29:53.376 --> 29:55.962
before I can say for sure
what really happened here.

29:56.045 --> 29:58.214
I know the results are pretty unpleasant,

29:58.339 --> 30:00.300
but at least they didn't
completely melt this time.

30:00.383 --> 30:02.469
That's a significant improvement!

30:02.552 --> 30:04.471
I'll redouble my efforts
for the beta test.

30:04.554 --> 30:05.889
That won't be necessary.

30:06.014 --> 30:08.224
Don't kill me.

30:08.349 --> 30:10.226
Please. It'll work next time.
You have my word.

30:10.351 --> 30:11.394
If not, kill me then!

30:11.478 --> 30:13.730
- I mean, of course, I'll beg again, but...
- Get up.

30:18.067 --> 30:19.652
These will do just fine.

30:22.197 --> 30:23.865
Are you serious?

30:24.574 --> 30:26.993
These primitives are
an abomination of science

30:27.076 --> 30:29.370
and a very poor reflection of my talents.

30:29.746 --> 30:32.916
They are not abominations.

30:35.919 --> 30:38.004
I've got to go with the doc on this one.

30:38.087 --> 30:40.256
I mean,
they're some very ugly muffins.

30:42.509 --> 30:44.385
They're part of me

30:45.678 --> 30:47.764
and the Inhuman race.

30:52.519 --> 30:54.229
I want you to make more.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.022
Just one more test.

30:56.439 --> 30:57.941
There's bound to be an improvement...

31:00.443 --> 31:02.195
More. Absolutely.

31:04.405 --> 31:05.740
How many?

31:09.953 --> 31:12.288
This is QJ-6. Ready for takeoff.

31:12.413 --> 31:15.542
<i>Copy that, QJ-6.
I'll see you in a few hours.</i>

31:15.625 --> 31:18.211
Just you and me? No one else?

31:18.294 --> 31:21.297
<i>Just us. Far away from everyone.</i>

31:23.633 --> 31:24.801
Mack.

31:25.969 --> 31:27.053
Ohh.

31:27.971 --> 31:31.224
I'm thinking maybe I'm not
the Inhuman whisperer.

31:40.275 --> 31:41.401
Lincoln?

31:43.236 --> 31:45.113
You run a tight ship, Coulson.

31:53.496 --> 31:55.498
Yeah, he's on his way.

31:55.582 --> 31:57.166
Good.

31:57.250 --> 31:59.168
I'll be there to greet him
when he arrives.

32:01.754 --> 32:03.923
I know you feel bad about lying to him,

32:04.007 --> 32:07.010
but once he joins us,
he'll understand.

32:08.845 --> 32:10.096
Come.

32:11.180 --> 32:13.308
There's something I want to show you.

32:23.943 --> 32:26.195
What happened to them?

32:26.279 --> 32:28.031
They're part of us.

32:29.365 --> 32:31.117
Our children, really,

32:31.200 --> 32:34.787
from our own flesh and blood,
and we're gonna make more of them.

32:36.289 --> 32:38.374
So, we'll need more blood.

32:40.209 --> 32:41.544
How much?

32:42.003 --> 32:43.379
All of it.

32:46.382 --> 32:47.967
Daisy's out of the system.

32:48.051 --> 32:49.052
That's good news,

32:49.218 --> 32:52.138
because I'm gonna call the President
and have that thing shot out of the sky.

32:52.221 --> 32:53.640
I'm afraid I can't let you make that call.

32:53.723 --> 32:57.560
Are you threatening me
after you just let him escape?

32:57.644 --> 32:59.187
He didn't escape.

33:03.399 --> 33:05.568
Well, if he wasn't on that jet
that just flew out of here,

33:05.693 --> 33:06.986
then who the hell was?

33:07.070 --> 33:09.822
Desperate times, desperate measures.

33:55.576 --> 33:58.996
<i>We knew Daisy was listening
and monitoring our every move,</i>

33:59.080 --> 34:00.915
so we couldn't tell anyone.

34:00.998 --> 34:03.209
She had to believe it was all real.

34:03.292 --> 34:06.295
I communicated with him
by leaving messages on his food trays.

34:06.379 --> 34:09.047
Your forgot the message
about not hurting his friend.

34:10.174 --> 34:13.261
Sorry, Mack.
I didn't have any other option.

34:13.344 --> 34:14.679
Mack wasn't supposed to be there.

34:14.762 --> 34:17.139
Excuse me for doing my job.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.100
The plan depended
on Daisy listening to everything,

34:19.183 --> 34:22.228
so that she'd trust me
and believe that I really wanted out.

34:22.311 --> 34:23.771
You had me fooled.

34:24.772 --> 34:27.024
Even though I wanted to,
I never trusted Daisy.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.068
Not under Hive's control.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.196
I knew that she wouldn't be
the one to greet me,

34:32.280 --> 34:33.364
no matter what she said.

34:33.447 --> 34:34.657
But what about the other risks?

34:34.741 --> 34:36.868
Lash could kill Daisy.
Did you stop to think about that?

34:37.659 --> 34:39.454
It's a risk we had to take.

34:39.536 --> 34:42.831
But he had the opportunity once before,
and he let her go.

34:42.915 --> 34:44.417
I don't think he's meant to kill her.

34:45.585 --> 34:46.918
Who put him on the Quinjet?

34:47.003 --> 34:50.547
I did, while Coulson
was keeping you distracted.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.759
You knew about this?

34:52.842 --> 34:54.719
I run a tight ship.

34:56.596 --> 35:00.099
Why do you think
this "Lash" can defeat Hive?

35:00.183 --> 35:02.310
And who in tarnation
names these things?

35:02.393 --> 35:06.147
Every Inhuman is here for a reason
and serves a purpose.

35:17.575 --> 35:21.037
<i>I believe Lash's purpose
is to kill Hive.</i>

35:54.237 --> 35:56.239
We're being attacked by...

35:56.322 --> 35:59.033
I don't know,
some kind of a monster.

36:00.034 --> 36:04.121
You shouldn't do that.
You've lost a lot of blood.

36:04.247 --> 36:05.706
I strongly advise against that.

36:16.008 --> 36:18.302
- Where's James?
- He's on a beer run.

36:18.386 --> 36:19.512
I suggest we do the same.

36:19.595 --> 36:21.889
Or at least the running part.

36:23.975 --> 36:25.309
Stay away from him!

37:04.515 --> 37:06.559
Now, you're free.

37:59.487 --> 38:02.198
Ragtag base, come in.

38:02.990 --> 38:05.076
This is Agent Daisy Johnson.

38:05.910 --> 38:07.578
I'm coming home.

38:08.037 --> 38:09.246
Repeat.

38:10.623 --> 38:12.291
I'm coming home.

38:35.314 --> 38:37.441
Welcome back, Agent Johnson.

38:42.655 --> 38:44.115
It's good to see you.

38:48.536 --> 38:50.955
Lash died trying to save me.

38:53.249 --> 38:55.042
Did he manage to kill Hive?

38:56.877 --> 38:58.587
Get her to the med bay.

39:06.137 --> 39:08.264
Lash wasn't here to kill Hive.

39:08.973 --> 39:11.183
He was here to save Daisy.

39:12.101 --> 39:13.602
<i>That wasn't Lash.</i>

39:17.648 --> 39:21.152
Prep for immediate blood transfusion
and full cranial scan.

39:21.235 --> 39:23.654
How do we know this isn't a trap?

39:23.738 --> 39:26.991
That she isn't under
Hive's voodoo spell?

39:27.074 --> 39:28.409
We'll know soon enough.

39:28.492 --> 39:30.161
In the meantime,

39:31.328 --> 39:33.330
have a little faith.

39:37.710 --> 39:39.879
Daisy is completely sway-free.

39:39.962 --> 39:41.380
Her brain is back to normal.

39:41.464 --> 39:43.299
But she is suffering
withdrawal symptoms

39:43.382 --> 39:45.092
from the effects of the sway.

39:45.176 --> 39:46.552
It'll take some time.

39:46.635 --> 39:48.971
She's resting now,
recovering from that and the blood loss,

39:49.055 --> 39:50.723
but we do expect a full recovery.

39:50.806 --> 39:53.309
Nobody goes in there until I say.

39:53.476 --> 39:54.643
But that's good news.

39:56.729 --> 39:59.774
I know that look.
That means there's bad news, too.

40:00.232 --> 40:01.400
What is it?

40:02.651 --> 40:03.778
Dr Fitz?

40:06.238 --> 40:08.699
Well, this is purely hypothetical,

40:08.783 --> 40:12.036
and there are a lot of
unknown variables, but...

40:12.411 --> 40:15.289
Based on what Daisy told us
about Hive's new pathogen...

40:15.372 --> 40:17.875
We think we know
what he plans to do with it.

40:18.626 --> 40:21.420
If he can create
some short of shock wave,

40:21.504 --> 40:23.714
then Hive could potentially infect

40:23.798 --> 40:26.383
a significant percentage
of the human race,

40:26.467 --> 40:30.054
turning them all into
the swayed, primitive Inhumans

40:30.137 --> 40:31.388
that Daisy described.

40:31.472 --> 40:33.265
If, and only if, he finds a way

40:33.349 --> 40:35.101
to disperse it high enough
in the atmosphere.

40:35.184 --> 40:36.393
Yeah.

40:38.270 --> 40:40.022
He has a way.

40:41.065 --> 40:43.984
That thing he stole
from the ATCU in Indiana.

40:44.735 --> 40:46.529
It was a warhead.

40:46.654 --> 40:48.906
A fully operational warhead.

41:01.043 --> 41:02.419
It's open.

41:07.341 --> 41:08.551
Elena.

41:14.932 --> 41:16.809
Does this mean you see a future now?

41:18.060 --> 41:19.770
Or I need a fast way out of here.

41:22.064 --> 41:25.276
Daisy's back.
That's a good thing, right?

41:25.901 --> 41:27.069
Mmm-hmm.

41:27.153 --> 41:29.655
Do you still think we can't win?

41:31.448 --> 41:35.911
I don't know,
but I'm ready to stand and fight.

41:36.537 --> 41:37.746
Give me your hands.

41:37.830 --> 41:39.331
Hmm?

41:40.249 --> 41:41.584
Close your eyes.

41:41.667 --> 41:43.502
Don't open them until I leave.

41:51.135 --> 41:53.721
Keep the faith, Alphonso Mackenzie.
