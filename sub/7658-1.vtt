LAST PARTY, I'VE MADE CERTAIN

01:43:30.537 --> 01:43:33.247
NOTHING'S GONNA GO
WRONG THIS TIME.

01:43:33.415 --> 01:43:36.000
WITH EVERYONE'S HELP,
THEY'RE ALL HERE,

01:43:36.168 --> 01:43:38.461
JUST AS YOU ALWAYS WANTED...

01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:41.088
ALL SEATED AROUND THE TABLE,
WAITING TO CELEBRATE YOUR

01:43:41.256 --> 01:43:45.301
BIRTHDAY... YOUR
PRECIOUS BIRTHDAY.

01:43:45.469 --> 01:43:49.138
AND AS A SPECIAL TREAT...

01:43:49.973 --> 01:43:53.768
THEY ALL GET
TO WATCH YOU DIE.

01:44:01.944 --> 01:44:04.946
MURDER...

01:44:05.113 --> 01:44:07.406
THEN SUICIDE.

01:44:07.574 --> 01:44:10.618
NOW THEY'LL ALL KNOW JUST
HOW CRAZY LITTLE GINNIE

01:44:10.786 --> 01:44:13.371
REALLY WAS!

01:44:30.138 --> 01:44:33.266
SURPRISED?

01:44:33.684 --> 01:44:36.477
I HOPE YOU ARE.

01:44:36.645 --> 01:44:39.689
I PLANNED IT SO YOU'D
NEVER SUSPECT A THING.

01:44:40.232 --> 01:44:42.692
NONE OF THEM DID.

01:44:42.859 --> 01:44:47.655
I DRESSED LIKE
YOU, WALKED LIKE YOU...

01:44:47.823 --> 01:44:50.992
I EVEN TALKED LIKE YOU.

01:44:51.827 --> 01:44:55.329
YOU MADE IT
ALL SO EASY FOR ME.

01:44:55.497 --> 01:44:57.832
I WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.459
YOU TRUSTED ME.

01:45:00.627 --> 01:45:05.298
I COULD COME
AND GO AS I PLEASED.

01:45:05.465 --> 01:45:09.176
YOU WOKE UP
REMEMBERING NOTHING.

01:45:09.344 --> 01:45:12.888
IT WORKED EVERY TIME.

01:45:13.056 --> 01:45:15.433
THAT NIGHT IN
THE CEMETERY...

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:20.396
WITH POOR, LITTLE ALFRED...
GENIUS MASK-MAKER.

01:45:20.564 --> 01:45:23.774
REMEMBER HOW HE FOOLED US
WITH BERNADETTE?

01:45:23.942 --> 01:45:28.404
YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT, BUT HE
HAD FOLLOWED YOU THERE,

01:45:28.572 --> 01:45:30.990
AND SO HAD I.

01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:34.744
I DID IT AGAIN AFTER
THE DANCE WITH STEVE.

01:45:34.911 --> 01:45:37.413
HE WAS SO STONED HE
DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE FOR

01:45:37.581 --> 01:45:39.665
A MOMENT IT WASN'T YOU.

01:45:39.833 --> 01:45:42.793
AND TONIGHT WITH DAVID.

01:45:52.679 --> 01:45:56.223
[CRYING]

01:46:03.398 --> 01:46:05.566
GREG: HEY, THAT NIMROD
OWES ME 20 BUCKS.

01:46:05.734 --> 01:46:07.193
STEVE: AT 4 TO 1,
WE MADE 200 BUCKS.

01:46:07.361 --> 01:46:08.652
ETIENNE: 200 BUCKS?!

01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:10.071
WE ARE RICH!

01:46:10.238 --> 01:46:11.822
ANN: THIS CALLS
FOR A CELEBRATION!

01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:13.199
GREG: THE SILENT WOMAN!

01:46:13.367 --> 01:46:14.575
ALL: ALL RIGHT!

01:46:14.743 --> 01:46:16.118
ALFRED: SAY HI TO GEORGE.

01:46:16.286 --> 01:46:18.704
ALL: HI, GEORGE.

01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:22.166
[CRYING]

01:46:26.046 --> 01:46:28.881
AND NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

01:46:29.758 --> 01:46:31.967
YOU DESERVE TO DIE.

01:46:32.135 --> 01:46:34.595
YOU'RE JUST LIKE HER!

01:46:34.763 --> 01:46:37.515
A FUCKING WHORE!

01:46:37.682 --> 01:46:40.393
MY FATHER'S MISTRESS.

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:43.229
AND YOU'RE HIS DAUGHTER...

01:46:43.397 --> 01:46:45.940
MY SISTER.

01:46:46.108 --> 01:46:50.027
SOMETHING SHE NEVER
LET MY FATHER FORGET.

01:46:50.195 --> 01:46:52.863
THAT'S WHY MY
MOTHER LEFT US.

01:46:53.031 --> 01:46:56.409
SHE COULD NEVER
FORGIVE HIM FOR HAVING YOU.

01:46:56.576 --> 01:46:59.245
IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

01:46:59.413 --> 01:47:02.373
YOU'VE RUINED OUR LIVES.

01:47:03.458 --> 01:47:05.835
YOU SHOULD'VE DIED
THAT NIGHT AT THE CANAL.

01:47:06.002 --> 01:47:07.920
YOU NEVER SHOULD'VE
BEEN BORN!

01:47:08.088 --> 01:47:10.506
NOOOOO!

01:47:11.007 --> 01:47:14.135
UGH!

01:47:35.157 --> 01:47:37.324
DEAR GOD.

01:47:38.577 --> 01:47:41.412
