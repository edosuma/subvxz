WEBVTT

00:10.468 --> 00:13.388
{\an3}Can you tape
that box for me?

00:13.471 --> 00:14.764
I'm not going to help you.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.599
You know, I don't get you.

00:16.683 --> 00:17.600
I really don't.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.979
{\an1}Valerie, you're being way
too hard on yourself.

00:21.062 --> 00:22.939
{\an1}Nobody wants you
to move back to Buffalo.

00:23.022 --> 00:24.023
Oh, yeah?

00:24.107 --> 00:25.650
Talk to Steve.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.152
Steve's still got one good hand.

00:27.235 --> 00:28.778
Dylan's still got a face.

00:28.862 --> 00:29.654
They'll get over it.

00:29.738 --> 00:30.447
And what about your parents?

00:30.530 --> 00:32.573
{\an1}One thing about
Jim and Cindy is,

00:32.656 --> 00:34.159
no matter how bad you screw up,

00:34.242 --> 00:35.952
you always get a second chance.

00:36.035 --> 00:37.787
{\an1}Don't tell them
I told you this, but...

00:37.871 --> 00:39.998
you also get a third,
fourth and fifth, too.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.876
Well, the way I'm going,
even that wouldn't be enough.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.878
You'll never know if you bail.

00:44.961 --> 00:47.797
Brandon, I can't stay here.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.966
I mean, everywhere I look,
there's someone who hates me.

00:50.049 --> 00:52.719
And I think you're exaggerating.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.472
Call it what you want.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.932
It's time to cut my losses.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.147
(sighs)

01:04.230 --> 01:07.108
Don't worry about anything.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.527
I understand.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.863
He understands, too.

01:11.946 --> 01:14.282
Abby, please.

01:14.365 --> 01:16.659
Yes, I'll tell her for you.

01:16.743 --> 01:17.869
Okay, Abby.

01:17.952 --> 01:19.996
Bye-bye.

01:21.956 --> 01:24.125
This is a lot more
than we agreed to

01:24.209 --> 01:25.794
when we said we'd
let her stay here.

01:25.877 --> 01:28.129
Jim, did you honestly think

01:28.213 --> 01:30.298
{\an1}all she'd need was
a roof over her head?

01:30.381 --> 01:33.176
Well, don't pretend
you saw this coming.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.677
Saw what coming?

01:34.761 --> 01:37.889
{\an3}Well, there's been
a problem in Buffalo.

01:37.972 --> 01:39.808
{\an3}Your mother's thinking
of checking herself

01:39.891 --> 01:41.184
{\an3}into a clinic
for a few days.

01:41.267 --> 01:44.020
And she didn't want
to talk to me?

01:44.103 --> 01:46.981
{\an1}Valerie, she's been
through a tough time.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.525
I can't believe
she's flipping out now!

01:48.608 --> 01:50.860
I mean, who's going to take care
of Curt and Susie?

01:50.944 --> 01:52.695
{\an1}They're already settled in
with a neighbor.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.031
{\an3}I have the number; you can
call them later if you want.

01:55.114 --> 01:56.991
So I'm just supposed
to stay here and let her go

01:57.075 --> 01:58.493
crazy by herself?

01:58.576 --> 02:01.162
{\an1}Valerie, she's
going to be okay.

02:01.246 --> 02:04.165
But she needs you to stay
in Los Angeles right now.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.125
I can't.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.544
Didn't you tell her
what happened?

02:07.627 --> 02:08.544
Valerie...

02:08.627 --> 02:10.045
{\an1}Look, I just
can't stay here.

02:10.128 --> 02:12.590
I mean it.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.099
{\an1}Hey, is this thing
big enough?

03:45.183 --> 03:47.477
Yeah, try lifting it
and you'd know it's big enough.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.394
{\an3}No, really.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.480
How many kids are we
having here tomorrow?

03:50.563 --> 03:52.190
If I didn't know
the real story,

03:52.273 --> 03:53.483
I'd swear you were faking

03:53.566 --> 03:55.443
{\an1}this injury just so
you can get out of work.

03:55.526 --> 03:56.486
Look, I'm working
here, all right?

03:56.569 --> 03:59.072
{\an3}I'm keeping this Halloween
vision alive, all right?

04:06.037 --> 04:09.499
{\an1}So... this is what you've
been doing the last few days.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.335
You weren't just avoiding me.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.962
I wasn't avoiding you.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.964
So you're okay?

04:16.047 --> 04:17.507
Yeah. I told you,

04:17.589 --> 04:19.509
I'm fine about last weekend
at Catalina.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.636
And you've really forgiven me

04:21.719 --> 04:23.554
{\an1}for trying to make it
a sleepover?

04:23.638 --> 04:25.598
I mean it, we're fine.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.517
And you're terrific.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.435
How come I'm not convinced?

04:32.855 --> 04:34.190
STEVE:
All right.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.650
That's it.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.610
I'm implementing a no make-out
rule at our party,

04:37.694 --> 04:39.404
{\an1}especially for those
of us who are romantically

04:39.487 --> 04:41.072
disadvantaged like myself.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.532
{\an1}That includes you
and Brandon, Kelly.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.200
{\an3}Well, you don't have
to worry about Brandon,

04:44.283 --> 04:46.244
{\an3}'cause I just called him
and he's not coming today.

04:46.327 --> 04:47.036
{\an3}He's not?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.038
No, he wanted to,
it's just that...

04:49.122 --> 04:52.333
{\an3}Valerie isn't
leaving after all.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.252
{\an1}You think she'd reconsider
if I bought her ticket?

04:54.335 --> 04:55.336
{\an1}I'd pitch in
for first class

04:55.420 --> 04:58.006
{\an3}if it would get her out of
that house with Brandon.

04:58.089 --> 04:58.756
{\an1}Yeah, the KEG
curse on anyone

04:58.840 --> 04:59.716
{\an1}who tries to string
along two guys

04:59.799 --> 05:02.260
{\an1}just so she can knife
one of them in the back.

05:02.343 --> 05:04.887
Well, I'm sure
she didn't plan it that way.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.055
Of course she did.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.891
{\an1}What else did she
think could happen?

05:08.975 --> 05:10.351
(horn honking)

05:11.686 --> 05:13.604
That's the pumpkin guy.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.274
Wait, I thought Muntz
was picking up the pumpkins?

05:16.357 --> 05:17.275
Yeah, Muntz called
for directions,

05:17.358 --> 05:19.777
{\an1}and the pumpkin dude said
he could deliver 'em.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.029
Lucky break, huh?

05:21.112 --> 05:21.904
Hmm.

05:22.655 --> 05:23.740
Okay, let's go slackers!

05:23.823 --> 05:25.241
It's pumpkin time.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.286
Oh, my God, what
am I going to do?

05:28.369 --> 05:30.705
Donna, they were bound to run
into each other sooner or later.

05:30.788 --> 05:31.539
Oh!

05:31.622 --> 05:33.041
You could start running now.

05:33.124 --> 05:34.542
Great, thanks.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.044
(groans)

05:39.672 --> 05:40.590
Hey.

05:40.673 --> 05:41.591
Hey.

05:41.674 --> 05:42.717
So, who's this?

05:42.800 --> 05:43.760
This is my cousin Tommy.

05:43.843 --> 05:44.761
{\an3}Hi.

05:44.844 --> 05:45.762
Hi.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.225
{\an1}Sorority sisters
wouldn't approve, huh?

05:51.309 --> 05:54.062
Well, I just haven't
told them about us yet.

05:54.145 --> 05:55.938
{\an1}Hey, Tommy,
why don't you hop down

05:56.022 --> 05:57.940
and start unloading
these pumpkins, huh?

05:58.024 --> 05:59.484
TOMMY:
All right.

05:59.567 --> 06:02.570
So, uh, what did you mean about
that sorority sisters thing?

06:02.653 --> 06:04.489
Oh, I don't know.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.491
You didn't exactly introduce me
to all your friends

06:06.574 --> 06:08.951
{\an1}that night
at the Peach Pit.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.579
{\an1}I know they're
all college types.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.665
Everyone, this is Ray!

06:14.749 --> 06:16.793
And this here
is his cousin Tommy.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.086
{\an3}So, Tommy,

06:18.169 --> 06:20.129
how old are you? About 35?

06:20.213 --> 06:21.339
Almost nine.

06:21.422 --> 06:22.340
{\an3}Yeah? Well,
we're having a party

06:22.423 --> 06:23.758
{\an3}here tomorrow for people
that are almost nine.

06:23.841 --> 06:24.759
You want to come?

06:24.842 --> 06:26.010
Can I?

06:26.094 --> 06:27.595
Hey, he's the man.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.597
{\an1}If he invites you,
you'd better be there.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.973
All right, cool!

06:31.057 --> 06:32.683
Hey, thanks, man.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.477
{\an1}You're about the first guy
on campus that's ever

06:34.560 --> 06:36.604
{\an1}gotten off his pedestal
and said hello.

06:36.687 --> 06:39.023
Hey,<i> liberté, egalité,</i>
<i>fraternité.</i>

06:39.107 --> 06:41.400
{\an3}Next time they tell you KEG
is a bunch of elitist stiffs,

06:41.484 --> 06:42.652
you'll set them straight, eh?

06:42.735 --> 06:45.279
Yeah.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.365
Whatever.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.211
{\an1}I was up all night
thinking,

07:00.294 --> 07:01.671
and I have an aunt
in Tucson

07:01.754 --> 07:03.714
who might let me
live with her.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.134
{\an3}Valerie, you're not
going anywhere.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.678
Cindy, I heard you
when my mom called.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.847
You don't have to pretend
you want me to stay.

07:10.930 --> 07:11.848
All right, all right.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.599
I won't lie to you.

07:13.683 --> 07:17.478
When your mother said she was
incapable of taking care of you,

07:17.562 --> 07:19.814
{\an1}it definitely
threw us for a loop.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.732
{\an1}But we're not going
to cut you loose.

07:21.816 --> 07:24.527
{\an1}We've known your parents
since before you were born.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.320
{\an3}And in this family,
when we have

07:26.404 --> 07:28.322
a problem, we work it out.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.574
Right, Brandon?

07:29.657 --> 07:32.034
I tried to tell you yesterday.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.246
{\an1}The fact is,
I should have warned you

07:35.329 --> 07:37.331
more clearly about Dylan McKay.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.332
CINDY:
There was a long history

07:38.416 --> 07:41.002
{\an3}before you even got here,
and Dylan's always

07:41.085 --> 07:44.380
been very... complex.

07:44.463 --> 07:46.674
I think it's time that
we all acknowledge what

07:46.757 --> 07:48.926
Dylan McKay has become and...

07:49.010 --> 07:50.052
{\an1}stay away.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.387
(doorbell chimes)

07:51.470 --> 07:53.556
Oh, I told Andrea
she could stop by

07:53.639 --> 07:56.392
and borrow Brenda's old
bunny suit for Hannah.

07:56.475 --> 07:57.435
I'll get it.
Where's it at?

07:57.518 --> 07:58.519
{\an3}Oh, it's right
by the door.

07:58.603 --> 08:01.814
I know you guys are
all putting yourselves out.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.109
I'll do my part.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.611
I know you will.

08:10.364 --> 08:11.616
Are you all right?

08:13.201 --> 08:15.411
Yeah, I'm okay.

08:15.494 --> 08:18.039
{\an1}I just wish I could start
with a clean slate.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.708
You have that here.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.376
That's what we're saying.

08:23.669 --> 08:24.712
{\an1}JIM:
Cindy, come here!

08:24.795 --> 08:26.255
You gotta see this.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.806
Oh, does this bring back
memories or what?

08:35.890 --> 08:38.058
Aw, come here, honey.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.269
Aw, yes!

08:40.352 --> 08:43.438
I just can't wait till
we have one of our own.

08:43.522 --> 08:45.316
{\an1}If they make rabbit
suits in adult sizes,

08:45.399 --> 08:47.068
{\an1}I'll get one
for each of you.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.236
{\an3}CINDY:
Very funny, Brandon.

08:48.319 --> 08:51.239
What do you think she even
makes of Halloween, anyway?

08:51.322 --> 08:52.740
{\an1}Oh, at this age,
about all that registers

08:52.823 --> 08:54.617
is if Mom and Dad are nearby.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.118
JESSE:
Could you repeat that, please?

08:56.202 --> 08:57.370
{\an1}I'm trying to convince
Andrea here

08:57.453 --> 08:59.330
{\an1}that Hannah will not
be permanently scarred

08:59.413 --> 09:01.165
{\an1}by celebrating Day
of the Dead with my family

09:01.249 --> 09:03.459
{\an3}tomorrow night.
"Day of the Dead"?

09:03.543 --> 09:04.919
{\an3}I know, it
sounds morbid,

09:05.002 --> 09:06.295
but it's this
really great,

09:06.379 --> 09:08.297
{\an6}old Mexican
tradition.
It's part

09:08.381 --> 09:10.424
harvest festival,
part Aztec ritual

09:10.508 --> 09:12.301
{\an1}with a little bit
of Catholicism thrown in.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.135
Something for everyone, huh?

09:13.219 --> 09:14.804
ANDREA:
The bottom line is, you sit

09:14.887 --> 09:16.764
{\an3}in a cemetery on a grave
all night long.

09:16.847 --> 09:19.558
{\an1}Wait a second,
wait just one second.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.811
{\an1}I sat through Yom Kippur,
and I'm telling you,

09:21.894 --> 09:24.313
{\an1}it wasn't exactly
a barrel of laughs.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.648
{\an3}CINDY:
Anybody got

09:25.731 --> 09:26.649
a clean diaper?

09:26.732 --> 09:28.025
Oh, I do.
Right here.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.819
Yeah, I'll come
with you.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.947
I don't know about
sitting on a grave,

09:33.030 --> 09:34.824
{\an1}but I'm all for remembering
your heritage.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.784
Yeah, well, me too, Bran,
but I've got to tell you,

09:36.867 --> 09:39.161
{\an3}if my Hasidic grandfather
from Minsk knew that Hannah

09:39.245 --> 09:41.289
was going to be sitting
in a cemetery all night

09:41.372 --> 09:43.833
{\an3}for a part-Aztec,
part-Catholic harvest ritual,

09:43.916 --> 09:45.543
he'd die all over again.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.171
DYLAN:
<i>Nat, this Peach Pit After Dark</i>

09:49.255 --> 09:50.715
{\an1}is a no-brainer.
You saw what I saw;

09:50.798 --> 09:52.300
{\an1}the money was
just rolling in.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.843
{\an3}Yeah, but that's when Steve
was running the business.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.512
Look, Steve is so replaceable.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.390
Can I tell you, we can just get
somebody else to do that job?

09:59.473 --> 10:00.558
{\an3}Sure, your friends,
your partners,

10:00.641 --> 10:01.892
{\an3}everyone--
they're all replaceable.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.352
I didn't say that.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.729
No, you just said Steve.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.230
The man who thought of the idea,

10:06.314 --> 10:07.481
got his friends
to put it together,

10:07.565 --> 10:08.941
{\an3}the guy that made it
a success.

10:09.025 --> 10:09.859
I get the picture.

10:09.942 --> 10:10.985
{\an3}Do you?

10:11.068 --> 10:12.987
Is any of this
real to you, Dylan?

10:13.070 --> 10:14.822
I don't even know if I'm getting
through to you any more.

10:14.905 --> 10:16.324
Is it real to me?!

10:16.407 --> 10:17.908
{\an1}Hey, I'm the one that took out
a mortgage on my house!

10:17.992 --> 10:20.536
If this thing doesn't work,
I'm on the street in two months.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.371
That's how real this is to me.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.040
The theatre down the street
just got out.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.124
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

10:25.207 --> 10:27.293
{\an1}All right, I'll be here
first thing in the morning.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.253
{\an3}First thing in the morning
is our busiest time.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.713
You would know that
if you had ever really

10:30.796 --> 10:32.381
taken an interest in this place.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.507
So when is good?

10:33.591 --> 10:35.468
4:00 in the afternoon.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.053
Fine, I'll be here at 4:00.

10:38.095 --> 10:39.722
Four!

10:39.805 --> 10:41.432
(entrance bell chimes)

10:41.515 --> 10:43.642
(distant laughter)

10:44.935 --> 10:46.520
Okay, some of the more
recent sightings

10:46.604 --> 10:47.730
are pretty questionable,

10:47.813 --> 10:49.565
but that doesn't change
the near certainty

10:49.649 --> 10:52.401
that some of these close
encounters have to be real.

10:52.485 --> 10:56.280
Here's one well-documented
hot spot not too far away.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.742
It's in the desert,
just east of Barstow.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.453
It's been a magnet
all year for people who want

11:02.536 --> 11:04.413
to find out for themselves
what this UFO thing...

11:04.497 --> 11:06.957
{\an1}If I had known you were
inviting me to a UFO lecture,

11:07.041 --> 11:08.459
{\an1}I would have
shown up even later.

11:08.542 --> 11:09.710
Shh, I want to hear this.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.420
The evidence is starting
to pile up.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.506
There have been hundreds
of sightings,

11:13.589 --> 11:16.342
and several people report
being abducted

11:16.425 --> 11:20.429
for what they describe
as breeding experiments.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.557
{\an3}Sex with
aliens? Hmm.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.101
{\an3}Might be worth taking
a little drive

11:25.184 --> 11:26.352
{\an3}out to the desert,
don't you think?

11:26.435 --> 11:30.231
{\an1}Or we could just go
to the movies.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.774
{\an3}Come on, we'll
grab a camcorder

11:31.857 --> 11:33.776
and go looking for
little green men.

11:33.859 --> 11:37.613
{\an1}(sighs) Martian bait--
who could say no to that?

11:37.697 --> 11:38.781
(giggles)

11:38.864 --> 11:40.157
LAZAROFF:
So what do we have here?

11:40.241 --> 11:42.618
Is it unidentified?
Does it fly?

11:42.701 --> 11:46.539
Yes, absolutely.
Absolutely.

11:46.622 --> 11:48.249
BRANDON:
Hey, bro.

11:48.332 --> 11:49.792
Need a hand?

11:49.875 --> 11:51.502
No, thanks, got one.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.295
{\an1}Could've used yours
about eight hours ago.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.339
{\an3}Well, I can't travel
back through time,

11:55.423 --> 11:57.466
{\an3}but I'd do that for
you if I could.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.676
{\an3}You know that,
don't you?

11:58.759 --> 12:00.678
Don't get cute
with me, Walsh.

12:00.761 --> 12:03.097
{\an3}I know you're fraternizing
with the enemy.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.473
{\an1}Well, if it's
any consolation,

12:04.557 --> 12:06.475
{\an1}you're doing better
than she is.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.310
Oh, yeah, how
do you know?

12:08.394 --> 12:09.979
{\an3}I fell for her,
she broke my heart.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.147
And don't even
get me started

12:11.230 --> 12:12.314
{\an3}about my good buddy,
Dylan McKay.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.316
{\an1}You'll get no argument
from me there, man.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.317
Total write-off.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.111
Valerie's no saint either.

12:17.194 --> 12:21.115
I know, and I'm not saying
forget what happened, but...

12:21.198 --> 12:22.199
But what?

12:22.283 --> 12:24.326
Steve, she was wrong,

12:24.410 --> 12:26.036
no doubt about it,

12:26.120 --> 12:29.039
but Valerie really feels
like everyone hates her.

12:29.123 --> 12:32.668
{\an4}(laughing):
I wonder what she did
to deserve that, huh?

12:32.751 --> 12:34.712
Yeah, please.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.213
{\an3}Look.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.382
She'd freak if she knew
I was telling you this,

12:38.466 --> 12:41.844
but... her mom checked herself
into a mental ward.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.846
That's why she's not
going back to Buffalo.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.514
You're kidding.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.516
{\an3}No.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.059
{\an3}Her father
killed himself.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.186
Her mom's lost it.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.855
She's got no one, man;
can't you give her a break?

12:54.774 --> 12:56.567
If you give her another chance,
everybody will.

12:56.650 --> 12:59.028
Come on, bro.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.364
"Come on, bro"?

13:02.448 --> 13:03.574
Is that the best argument

13:03.657 --> 13:05.659
you can come up with,
"Come on, bro"?

13:08.454 --> 13:09.747
(sighs)

13:09.830 --> 13:12.041
Have her come by
the KEG party tomorrow.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.584
You're doing
a good thing here, man.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.503
I may forgive Valerie,
I may not,

13:15.586 --> 13:18.380
but don't ever ask me
to forgive Dylan McKay.

13:18.464 --> 13:22.259
Like I said, you'll get
no argument from me there.

13:22.343 --> 13:27.431
No, sir, no, please, I...
I appreciate you calling me

13:27.515 --> 13:29.016
at my home at 11:00 p.m.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.352
Yes, your... your diligence
is commendable.

13:31.435 --> 13:37.149
However... my computer records,
I have right in front of me,

13:37.233 --> 13:41.529
and they show that I wrote
your company a check,

13:41.612 --> 13:43.697
number 150...

13:45.658 --> 13:47.576
at 2:00 p.m...

13:52.790 --> 13:54.708
Hold on.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.210
(phone clatters on floor)

14:00.256 --> 14:01.840
(clicking)

14:11.642 --> 14:14.562
You two are the first
human beings I've ever met

14:14.645 --> 14:16.438
who actually
like strawberry ice cream.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.439
{\an3}Yeah, well, it's
not for us.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.482
The aliens like it.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.483
I said, "reportedly", okay?

14:19.567 --> 14:21.485
They reportedly like it.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.279
Wait a second, what aliens?

14:23.362 --> 14:24.405
{\an3}The aliens
that have been

14:24.488 --> 14:27.241
abducting people in the desert
outside of Barstow.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.577
Are you serious about this?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.246
David, I saw that,
all right, and if you

14:32.329 --> 14:34.290
don't want to go, I'm just
gonna go by myself, okay?

14:34.373 --> 14:35.624
To Barstow?

14:35.708 --> 14:36.875
Do you know how hot
it gets there?

14:36.959 --> 14:40.087
Well, luckily I've got lots of
ice cream and dry ice, so...

14:40.170 --> 14:42.590
{\an3}Donna, do you know where
these two are off to?

14:42.673 --> 14:44.300
Strawberry ice cream.

14:44.383 --> 14:47.469
{\an1}Hmm. Somewhere
with aliens?

14:47.553 --> 14:49.680
{\an1}(laughs) Relax. Clare told me
when I got back last night.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.307
CLARE:
Yeah, I caught her

14:51.390 --> 14:53.517
sneaking in at, like, 3:00
in the morning.

14:53.601 --> 14:57.479
Well, I think that's my cue
to start loading up the truck.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.274
Well, Ray and I went
to some blues club,

15:00.357 --> 15:03.152
{\an1}and the next thing I knew,
it was late. (giggles)

15:03.235 --> 15:05.988
So that's where you two
snuck off to all of a sudden.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.489
{\an1}Why? Was it
that obvious?

15:07.573 --> 15:09.116
{\an1}You think
Griffin noticed?

15:09.199 --> 15:10.492
No, I don't think so.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.994
{\an4}DONNA:
But would you
tell him already?

15:12.077 --> 15:13.537
{\an1}I'm dying waiting
for the ax to fall.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.497
{\an1}Maybe I should go
to the desert with you

15:15.581 --> 15:16.540
and get myself abducted.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.543
And miss a party
where two guys are after you?

15:19.627 --> 15:21.629
Where are your priorities?

15:22.630 --> 15:24.798
Hmm...

15:27.426 --> 15:29.219
(water bubbling)

15:30.471 --> 15:32.556
(kids screaming)

15:32.640 --> 15:34.892
(cackling)
Here you go, come on.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.644
You're crazy.
You know that?

15:36.727 --> 15:39.897
GRIFFIN:
Okay... go!

15:39.980 --> 15:40.856
(kids screaming)

15:40.939 --> 15:43.525
GRIFFIN:
26, 27, 28, 29...

15:43.609 --> 15:44.902
{\an3}time!
Yeah!

15:44.985 --> 15:46.362
And the winner,

15:46.445 --> 15:47.696
{\an3}with a new record
of eight apples

15:47.780 --> 15:48.906
in 30 seconds, Tommy!

15:48.989 --> 15:49.865
{\an3}RAY:
Hey!

15:49.948 --> 15:52.493
{\an3}Now you got to eat all
those. Just kidding.

15:52.576 --> 15:54.536
This is cool. How do you
get into a fraternity?

15:54.620 --> 15:56.372
{\an6}RAY:
Well, you gotta
go to college

15:56.455 --> 15:57.998
is how you get in,
so do your homework, all right?

15:58.082 --> 16:00.876
Hey, uh, have you
seen Donna around?

16:00.959 --> 16:04.338
{\an3}Uh, mystery to me.
Um... if she shows up,

16:04.421 --> 16:05.881
{\an3}I'll tell her you're
looking for her.

16:05.964 --> 16:07.216
Thanks, man.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.218
{\an3}All right, man,
you won.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.552
{\an1}You know, I haven't
seen Brandon.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.513
{\an1}Are you sure he's not
hiding underneath there?

16:12.596 --> 16:14.223
{\an3}(giggles)

16:15.974 --> 16:18.811
{\an4}STEVE:
Ugh! This is going
to be a lot harder

16:18.894 --> 16:20.020
than I thought.
(sighs)

16:20.104 --> 16:23.232
{\an3}Just file it under "the things
we do for Brandon Walsh."

16:23.315 --> 16:24.900
Ready?

16:24.983 --> 16:26.235
Hi, Valerie.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.528
Hi, Kel.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.905
So, how's the hand?

16:29.988 --> 16:33.617
{\an1}It's already decorated
for Halloween. Hmm.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.453
Well, I-I brought
this for the kids.

16:36.537 --> 16:39.206
Wow. It must have taken
hours to make this, huh?

16:39.289 --> 16:40.541
VALERIE (chuckles):
Just about.

16:40.624 --> 16:42.584
{\an5}Let's put it
on the table.
Okay. Thanks.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.713
Well, it looks like
you've already done

16:45.796 --> 16:46.880
{\an3}your good deed
for the day.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.757
{\an1}So now it's time
for you to do yours.

16:48.841 --> 16:49.925
{\an3}Oh, boy!

16:52.010 --> 16:54.054
(Kelly squeals)

16:54.138 --> 16:56.557
{\an3}Come over here and
I'll grant you a wish.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.142
(both chuckle)

17:01.854 --> 17:02.938
{\an1}Hi.

17:03.021 --> 17:03.939
The party's outside.

17:04.021 --> 17:05.232
{\an1}What are you
doing in here?

17:05.315 --> 17:07.443
I just can't juggle them.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.778
I'm afraid to ask.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.946
Griffin and Ray.

17:12.030 --> 17:14.575
You're playing two guys
against each other, too?

17:14.657 --> 17:16.410

{\an3}You know, there's a party
here tonight, Valerie.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.527
You have a costume?

18:31.610 --> 18:33.487
I could probably
fix something up.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.697
{\an1}You sure
you want me to come?

18:37.783 --> 18:39.493

green, so we match.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.664
Come on, Tommy, let's go.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.712
Ray!

19:35.799 --> 19:38.594
{\an3}Ray, it's not what
it looked like.

19:38.677 --> 19:39.928
Sure, he's probably
your brother, huh?

19:40.012 --> 19:41.096
Get in the truck, Tommy.

19:41.179 --> 19:42.723
{\an3}I told you I sort of
had a boyfriend.

19:42.806 --> 19:45.809
Yeah, and I sort of thought
we were way beyond that.

19:47.644 --> 19:49.062
Wait, please
don't leave.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.856
At least let me explain.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.901
Okay, tonight.
I'll pick you up.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.611
Ray, I have a party here
I can't get out of.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.154
(engine starts)

19:57.237 --> 19:58.614
Okay, fine, tonight.

19:58.697 --> 19:59.615
Donna, forget it.

19:59.698 --> 20:00.657
You got your friends.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.159
Go on back to them

20:02.242 --> 20:03.702
and have a good time.

20:12.169 --> 20:16.673
Oh, you know, man, some days the
gods, they just aren't with you.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.092
Luckily the presidents are.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.053
Okay, I'm giving odds here,
anybody?

20:21.136 --> 20:22.971
Anybody want some of this?

20:23.055 --> 20:24.681
{\an3}Give them
a break, McKay.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.642
You've been on a roll
for three hours, man.

20:26.725 --> 20:27.809
Well...

20:27.893 --> 20:29.770
(sighs)

20:29.853 --> 20:32.731
I was supposed to meet
my partner at 4:00.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.191
Yeah, well, you're raking in
some dough here.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.484
I'm sure he won't mind.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.277
Yeah, but somehow I don't think

20:37.361 --> 20:38.654
it's gonna be that easy.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.281
But what can I tell you,
you know? I'm a victim.

20:41.365 --> 20:44.159
All I need is a cue stick...
nine perfect spheres,

20:44.242 --> 20:50.540
2.7 yards of green felt,
no partners, no human element,

20:50.624 --> 20:53.377
no women making
unreasonable demands on me.

20:53.460 --> 20:58.340
Just me and a few simple laws
of geometry.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.300
Yeah, and a growing pile
of twenties.

21:00.384 --> 21:01.635
{\an3}(chuckles)

21:01.718 --> 21:03.845
Mm. Icing on the cake.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.347
It's the best high
in the world.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.556
Oh, believe me,

21:06.640 --> 21:08.684
it's not the best high
in the world.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.778
(insects chirping)

21:27.119 --> 21:29.538
{\an1}Well, this must be the place
everyone talks about.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.664
Yeah, I guess so.

21:30.747 --> 21:32.499
{\an3}I just wouldn't order anything
with mayonnaise on it

21:32.582 --> 21:34.501
unless you're looking
for a close encounter

21:34.584 --> 21:35.877
of the food poisoning kind.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.713
David, just behave, okay?

21:37.796 --> 21:40.382
These people hold the keys
to the best sighting areas.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.300
(people chattering)

21:54.312 --> 21:57.065
{\an1}This place
is giving me the creeps.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.109
{\an3}Shh! Come on.
Let's go sit down.

22:01.820 --> 22:06.199
Hi. Is this okay here?

22:06.283 --> 22:07.909
All right.

22:09.786 --> 22:11.079
Howdy.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.789
(clears throat)

22:15.375 --> 22:18.086
{\an3}So you guys get a lot
of kids in here?

22:18.170 --> 22:20.839
{\an1}BARTENDER:
Nope, not kids.

22:20.922 --> 22:23.467
They're small.

22:23.550 --> 22:26.136
He means aliens.

22:26.219 --> 22:27.220
Wait a second.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.639
{\an3}Are you telling me you
get aliens in this place?

22:29.723 --> 22:30.724
Not a lot.

22:30.807 --> 22:31.600
Some.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.436
{\an3}Look, we really want
to see some UFOs.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.730
{\an3}Could you tell us the best
spot where we could do that?

22:36.813 --> 22:38.398
You want to see mine?

22:39.399 --> 22:41.234
You have a spaceship?

22:41.318 --> 22:42.652
Got a nice video of it, too.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.488
Only $39.95.

22:44.571 --> 22:47.991
{\an3}So where do you and your
spaceship come from?

22:48.075 --> 22:48.784
David, don't.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.035
{\an5}All right?
(laughing):
What?

22:50.118 --> 22:51.411
It's no secret, ma'am.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.747
I'm from Xarga Patonia.

22:53.830 --> 22:56.875
I could sell you a set of maps
if you like.

22:56.958 --> 22:58.919
(sighs)

22:59.002 --> 23:00.545
{\an3}What, are you
getting the camera?

23:00.629 --> 23:01.963
Clare.

23:02.047 --> 23:03.256
Sorry, excuse us for a second.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.008
Clare, Clare.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.426
{\an3}(laughing):
What's wrong?

23:06.510 --> 23:07.260
{\an3}These people
are hilarious.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.137
{\an1}These people are crackpots,
all right?

23:09.221 --> 23:11.181
{\an1}They're making a total mockery
of the whole thing.

23:11.264 --> 23:12.557
That's fine,
talk it over.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.267
When you decide, come on back.

23:14.351 --> 23:15.727
{\an1}Plus, they're making
money on it.

23:15.811 --> 23:16.978
{\an1}You know,
it's disgusting.

23:17.062 --> 23:21.650
Oh, come on. Like you really
believe in all this UFO stuff.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.487
You're kidding me.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.114
{\an3}BARTENDER:
Oh, hey!

23:27.197 --> 23:29.866
We've got this pair of
handcrafted Xarga Patonia mugs.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.409
You might like these.

23:35.455 --> 23:36.790
(pounding on door)

23:36.873 --> 23:38.166
{\an3}Hey! Trick
or treat, man!

23:38.250 --> 23:40.043
Come on! Open up!

23:40.127 --> 23:42.295
{\an1}Guys, guys, you're
going to break the glass.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.840
I can see the guy in there.
He won't open the door.

23:44.923 --> 23:45.841
Dylan!

23:45.924 --> 23:46.842
(raps on door)

23:46.925 --> 23:48.635
Come on! Open up!

23:48.718 --> 23:50.720
Dylan, it's me!

23:53.890 --> 23:55.517
What?

23:55.600 --> 23:57.310
I was, uh... on my way

23:57.394 --> 23:58.520
{\an3}over to the
fraternity party,

23:58.603 --> 24:00.522
but something
came over me.

24:00.605 --> 24:04.151
You didn't bring your bodyguard
Sanders with you, did you?

24:04.234 --> 24:05.652
{\an1}'Cause I'm not up
for that right now.

24:05.735 --> 24:08.196
{\an3}No. It's just me and
Jesse James over here.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.239
He needs a trick
or treat.

24:09.322 --> 24:12.534
{\an1}Bullets on the coffee table,
Scotch in the cupboard.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.077
Is that single malt Scotch?

24:14.161 --> 24:17.706
Um... here.

24:17.789 --> 24:21.459
Great. What am I going to
do with five bucks, man?

24:21.543 --> 24:23.170
Share that!

24:23.253 --> 24:25.172
{\an1}What, five bucks?
Come on.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.548
Every kid within
a hundred miles

24:26.631 --> 24:28.258
{\an1}of this place
is going to be here.

24:28.341 --> 24:30.218
Happy Halloween to you, too.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.469
(door slams)

24:31.553 --> 24:35.098
On my way over, I was wondering
if you'd be glad to see me.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.600
Oh, what, are you kidding?
You look good.

24:36.683 --> 24:39.102
Mm, you look real good.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.231
Oh. What is it? Laces?

24:43.315 --> 24:44.566
{\an3}I thought those were
obsolete by now.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.026
I thought we'd
be moving into

24:46.109 --> 24:48.028
{\an3}Velcro body pads
or something.

24:48.111 --> 24:49.529
Dylan, are you
on something?

24:49.613 --> 24:52.073
{\an3}Mm-hmm. I'm going to be
all over you in just a minute.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.533
{\an3}I got a booster
at the pool hall.

24:53.617 --> 24:54.784
You want some?

24:54.868 --> 24:56.119
{\an1}No. I've got to go
to the fraternity party.

24:56.203 --> 24:58.079
{\an1}I've got to be
on my best behavior.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.040
Well, then you definitely
came to the wrong place,

25:00.123 --> 25:02.751
{\an3}because I had
the most amazing day.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.086
Look at that.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.588
Look, look, look.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.590
{\an1}Dylan, what are
those bullets for?

25:08.673 --> 25:11.426
Oh, those are
for the gun.

25:11.509 --> 25:12.928
What is the gun for?

25:13.011 --> 25:14.512
{\an3}It kind of goes
with the bullets.

25:14.596 --> 25:16.097
{\an1}Dylan, you've got
to get rid of that thing.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.808
{\an3}Hey, Val, lighten up.
I'm just cleaning it. Look.

25:18.892 --> 25:21.603
Dylan, my father
killed himself that way.

25:21.686 --> 25:22.771
{\an1}Well, I'm real sorry
to hear that,

25:22.854 --> 25:23.605
{\an1}but I don't need you
coming over here

25:23.688 --> 25:25.941
{\an1}and telling me
all this depressing stuff!

25:26.024 --> 25:28.610
It's the first good day
I've had in two months!

25:28.693 --> 25:32.614
Dylan, please, just
get rid of it, okay?

25:32.697 --> 25:35.158
{\an1}Why don't you just do us
both a big favor, huh?

25:35.242 --> 25:37.577
{\an1}Skip on off
to the frat party.

25:43.541 --> 25:44.709
(door slamming)

25:53.218 --> 25:54.636
The way this day is going,

25:54.719 --> 25:58.390
we're probably camping on
the wrong side of Barstow.

25:58.473 --> 26:01.476
Yeah, well, no aliens means more
strawberry ice cream for us.

26:01.559 --> 26:02.477
You want some?

26:02.560 --> 26:03.937
No.

26:04.020 --> 26:06.314
This experiment's
a total loss.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.441
Well, you know what?

26:08.525 --> 26:09.567
If you really think that,

26:09.651 --> 26:11.653
{\an1}we can always pack up
and head home.

26:11.736 --> 26:13.863
No. It's just so maddening.

26:13.947 --> 26:16.700
I know there's got
to be a mother ship or two

26:16.783 --> 26:18.451
floating around up there.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.870
Do you really
believe that?

26:20.954 --> 26:22.998
Come on, David.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.667
Ask nine out of ten people

26:25.750 --> 26:27.502
whether or not they think
we're alone in the universe,

26:27.585 --> 26:29.921
and they'll say,
"No. Of course not."

26:30.005 --> 26:32.674
And then tell the same people
you believe in UFOs,

26:32.757 --> 26:38.138
and it's, like...."We have some
wonderful new treatments, dear."

26:38.221 --> 26:41.808
{\an1}Yeah, well, I think you'd look
beautiful in a straitjacket.

26:41.891 --> 26:43.351
David.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.020
{\an1}What?

26:45.103 --> 26:48.565
Just... don't, okay?

26:50.900 --> 26:52.068
(sighs)

27:00.452 --> 27:02.746
Ah! This is
so beautiful.

27:02.829 --> 27:05.165
Jesse told me it was beautiful.
I didn't believe him.

27:05.248 --> 27:06.875
{\an1}Well, I guess
it's just something

27:06.958 --> 27:08.376
{\an1}you gotta see
for yourself. Right, Ma?

27:08.460 --> 27:09.669
Dodger Dogs?

27:09.753 --> 27:11.171
TERESA:
Well, you know, my father was

27:11.254 --> 27:12.881
{\an3}the world's
biggest Dodger fan.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.883
Boy, that's the truth.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.551
{\an1}I was so afraid
he was going to disown me

27:16.634 --> 27:18.928
{\an1}after my own pitching career
ended with Little League.

27:19.012 --> 27:20.055
{\an3}No.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.264
Luis loved this boy.

27:21.348 --> 27:22.265
{\an1}No, no.

27:22.349 --> 27:23.850
He liked me, Ma.

27:23.933 --> 27:25.602
{\an1}He loved
Fernando Valenzuela.

27:25.685 --> 27:30.732
{\an6}JESSE:
Hey, Aunt Celia,
Uncle Mario.<i> ¿Como esta?</i>

27:30.815 --> 27:31.733
You remember Andrea,
don't you?

27:31.816 --> 27:34.944
Hi, Uncle Mario, Aunt Celia.
This is Hannah.

27:35.028 --> 27:38.865
{\an1}Oh! Jesse,
you were right.

27:38.948 --> 27:41.743
{\an1}She's a beautiful
little girl.

27:41.826 --> 27:42.911
{\an1}Yes.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.913
{\an1}(cooing)

27:44.996 --> 27:46.373
(chuckling)

27:46.456 --> 27:48.875
You like this, do you?

27:48.958 --> 27:52.462
Well, this is for your
first communion, huh?

27:52.545 --> 27:55.090
{\an1}Precious.

27:59.636 --> 28:02.764
{\an5}DAVID:
So what do you think
a UFO would look like anyway?

28:02.847 --> 28:04.432
I don't know.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.268
It could be a flash of
light across the sky,

28:07.352 --> 28:10.105
something hovering
near the surface,

28:10.188 --> 28:14.025
{\an3}or a string of lights
in the middle of nowhere.

28:15.693 --> 28:17.404
{\an1}You mean
something like that?

28:17.487 --> 28:18.405
Hmm?

28:18.488 --> 28:19.489
There.

28:21.324 --> 28:23.952
Oh, my God! That's it!

28:24.035 --> 28:25.620
Come on!

28:25.703 --> 28:26.913
Wait. You want me
to get the camera?

28:26.996 --> 28:28.581
{\an1}Yes! And the
ice cream, too!

28:38.550 --> 28:39.801
Come on! Hurry up!

28:39.884 --> 28:41.469
I am hurrying.

28:41.553 --> 28:44.472
{\an3}Oh, God! Oh, God! I can
feel it. This is it!

28:44.556 --> 28:46.599
{\an3}What are we going
to say to them?

28:46.683 --> 28:47.809
{\an3}I mean, what if
they don't like us?

28:47.892 --> 28:49.811
{\an1}What if we
don't like them?

28:49.894 --> 28:51.229
Here. Give me that.

28:52.897 --> 28:55.817
{\an3}This is Clare Arnold,
homo sapiens,

28:55.900 --> 28:57.819
in the desert
near Barstow

28:57.902 --> 28:59.279
{\an3}preparing for close
contact with...

28:59.362 --> 29:01.990
Is "aliens" an insulting term?

29:02.073 --> 29:04.576
{\an1}I'm sure it's not what
they call themselves, right?

29:06.202 --> 29:07.704
Oh, my God!

29:07.787 --> 29:10.582
Oh, my God!

29:12.917 --> 29:15.837
{\an5}CLARE:
Oh, my God!
It's a satellite dish.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.631
{\an3}(groaning)
Oh...

29:20.633 --> 29:22.886
You know, this really
isn't a good place

29:22.969 --> 29:24.304
to have a nervous breakdown.

29:24.387 --> 29:27.015
There's scorpions
and snakes and things.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.808
I'm such an idiot.

29:30.059 --> 29:32.812
You could tell me I'm not,
you know.

29:32.896 --> 29:35.690
Yeah, well, I...
I feel like one, too.

29:35.773 --> 29:38.860
Well, I guess that's a start.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.987
(grunting)

29:41.946 --> 29:45.033
Mm, your hands
are all sticky.

29:45.116 --> 29:47.952
{\an3}I like that in
a man, you know.

29:54.167 --> 29:56.002
No, no.
That's baloney, all right?

29:56.085 --> 29:58.004
It doesn't take two hours
to get here from your house.

29:58.087 --> 30:00.673
I know exactly where she is.
She's with McKay.

30:00.757 --> 30:01.925
I got to go!
(slams phone)

30:07.013 --> 30:08.848
I called Ray's mom.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.225
{\an1}I even went to the
pumpkin place after he left.

30:10.308 --> 30:11.226
No one's seen him.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.061
At least that's
what they said.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.270
{\an3}You've really fallen
for this guy, huh?

30:14.354 --> 30:17.857
I just wish it hadn't ended
with him storming off like that.

30:17.941 --> 30:20.860
What about Griffin?

30:22.862 --> 30:24.405
(sighs)

30:24.489 --> 30:28.910
Well, our relationship's kind of
hit the point where, you know...

30:28.993 --> 30:30.411
Sex.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.579
{\an1}Right.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.331
{\an3}Well, if he's
not willing

30:33.414 --> 30:35.250
{\an3}to accept the fact that
you want to stay a virgin,

30:35.333 --> 30:36.960
then you've got
a big problem.

30:37.043 --> 30:40.922
{\an1}Yeah, well, I haven't
exactly told him.

30:41.005 --> 30:43.049
Not even after
last weekend?

30:43.132 --> 30:45.093
{\an1}It's not that
easy, you know.

30:45.176 --> 30:47.095
{\an3}Donna, you're stringing
this guy along.

30:48.555 --> 30:49.889
You've got to tell him.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.809
Fine, but just not now, okay?

30:52.892 --> 30:54.102
{\an1}Will you just stick
here with me, please?

30:54.185 --> 30:55.770
I'm sorry. I can't.

30:55.853 --> 30:57.480
I'm getting up early to go
to a swap meet with Jackie.

30:57.564 --> 30:58.940
Someone else is going to have

30:59.023 --> 30:59.941
{\an3}to hold your hand
on this one.

31:00.024 --> 31:02.652
Great.

31:02.735 --> 31:05.113
{\an1}Man, they should have
outlawed that Valerie chick

31:05.196 --> 31:06.781
when they banned
assault weapons.

31:06.864 --> 31:08.783
{\an1}Her not showing up pushed
Sanders right over the edge.

31:08.866 --> 31:11.327
She should have been honest
with him from the beginning.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.289
I got to go.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.417
See ya.

31:18.876 --> 31:20.211
What was that about?

31:23.047 --> 31:26.634
Well, Kelly thinks I need to
talk to you about a few things.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.803
Kelly thinks?

31:28.886 --> 31:31.055
Well, I guess I do, too.

31:31.139 --> 31:34.100
About why we're not
sleeping together.

31:34.183 --> 31:35.935
{\an1}(sighing):
Who is he, Donna?

31:36.019 --> 31:36.936
{\an3}What?

31:37.020 --> 31:39.480
No. It... it's not another guy.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.441
So you're not
seeing anyone else?

31:41.524 --> 31:44.027
Look, you're not

31:44.110 --> 31:46.112
Valerie what's-her-name,
and I'm not Steve Sanders,

31:46.195 --> 31:48.489
so just tell me the truth.
Who is he?

31:48.573 --> 31:52.952
Well, I went out with Ray Pruit
a couple of times...

31:53.036 --> 31:54.454
We're talking
about Mr. Pumpkin Head?

31:54.537 --> 31:56.873
You know what, Griffin?
Go to hell!

32:04.047 --> 32:06.674
When you tell your mother
that I wasn't good enough,

32:06.758 --> 32:07.884
be sure to tell her that

32:07.967 --> 32:09.469
{\an1}you're getting it on
with the delivery boy!

32:13.723 --> 32:16.684
{\an1}What's he do? Throw you down
in the back of his pickup?

32:16.768 --> 32:18.978
What makes you think you
can talk to me that way?

32:19.062 --> 32:21.397
Because you're a pathological
tease who sluts around and....

32:24.651 --> 32:27.820
{\an1}Oh, that really
put me in my place.

32:27.904 --> 32:29.906
{\an1}I can't believe I put up
with you as long as I did.

32:39.332 --> 32:41.000
Please, just drive.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.442
That's right.

33:06.526 --> 33:09.237
Just tiptoe in,
and everything will be fine.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.406
I tried to go to the
KEG party, Brandon.

33:11.489 --> 33:12.782
I... I really did.

33:12.865 --> 33:16.119
But the car had a mind
of its own. Right?

33:16.202 --> 33:18.037
Let me guess.

33:18.121 --> 33:21.040
{\an3}It drove you right over
to Dylan's house.

33:21.124 --> 33:23.251
{\an1}Okay, so I'm a huge
disappointment.

33:23.334 --> 33:25.086
{\an3}Spare me the
self-pity, will you?

33:25.169 --> 33:27.380
I had to beg everyone to
give you a second chance.

33:27.463 --> 33:28.631
Well, maybe you
shouldn't have.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.925
You know, I can't go
to these frat parties

33:31.008 --> 33:32.593
{\an1}knowing Dylan is
going down and down

33:32.677 --> 33:34.554
{\an1}and I'm the only one
there for him.

33:34.637 --> 33:35.763
That's his choice.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.807
{\an1}How can you just
turn your back on him?

33:37.890 --> 33:39.267
{\an1}I mean, you're
willing to let me

33:39.350 --> 33:41.060
{\an1}start over 20 times
if I have to.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.603
{\an1}What did Dylan do
that's so horrible,

33:42.687 --> 33:43.604
you have to shut him out?

33:43.688 --> 33:44.939
He knows if he wants help,

33:45.022 --> 33:46.607
all he has to do
is say the word.

33:46.691 --> 33:47.734
But he is.

33:47.817 --> 33:50.945
I mean, what kind of hitting
bottom are you waiting for?

33:51.028 --> 33:53.364
{\an1}He's over there
drugged out of his mind.

33:53.448 --> 33:54.949
He's taking drugs now?

33:55.032 --> 33:55.950
{\an1}Yeah.

33:56.033 --> 33:57.952
Hard stuff.

33:58.035 --> 34:00.621
{\an1}You know, it's like
my father all over again.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.623
{\an1}Sitting around the house
completely wasted,

34:02.707 --> 34:03.791
cleaning his gun.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.918
{\an1}What gun?
You know what gun.

34:06.002 --> 34:07.795
{\an1}He said he nearly shot you
with it last year.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.630
He told me he got rid of it.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.799
Well, obviously, he lied.

34:11.882 --> 34:13.801
It's not the first time.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.137
How was he when you left him?

34:16.219 --> 34:18.973
{\an3}I stayed with him until
he more or less passed out.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.766
Can I come?

34:20.850 --> 34:23.311
No.

34:33.612 --> 34:35.322
{\an3}Thanks for
bringing me here.

34:35.406 --> 34:36.949
{\an3}It feels like Griffin
and that whole mess

34:37.033 --> 34:39.159
are a thousand
miles away.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.995
{\an1}Well, when I
was growing up,

34:41.078 --> 34:42.955
and things would get
too crazy at home--

34:43.039 --> 34:44.956
{\an1}which was just
about every day--

34:45.041 --> 34:47.627
I would grab my guitar
and I'd come up here.

34:47.710 --> 34:50.670
And when I saw you whap that guy
across the face tonight,

34:50.755 --> 34:54.467
I thought, here's someone who
could use a change of scenery.

34:54.550 --> 34:56.469
{\an3}I don't know what
came over me.

34:56.552 --> 34:58.346
{\an1}You're not usually
a power hitter, huh?

34:58.429 --> 35:00.014
(laughing):
No.

35:00.097 --> 35:01.140
Good. Just checking.

35:01.224 --> 35:04.185
{\an1}You know, a guy's got to know
what he's getting into.

35:04.268 --> 35:05.853
(quiet laugh)

35:12.443 --> 35:14.028
What is it?

35:14.111 --> 35:16.155
{\an1}There's no sorority sisters
around this time.

35:16.239 --> 35:18.241
(sighs)

35:19.617 --> 35:21.869
{\an3}This is... really
hard to say,

35:21.953 --> 35:25.039
but I need you to know.

35:25.998 --> 35:27.875
Oh, God...

35:27.959 --> 35:30.211
this is really hard to say.

35:30.294 --> 35:34.132
{\an1}Well, we got all
the time in the world.

35:36.634 --> 35:40.388
{\an1}I want you to hear something
I've been working on.

35:49.313 --> 35:51.899
Ray, we can't have sex.

35:53.818 --> 35:54.944
Yeah?

35:55.027 --> 35:58.072
Look, I don't have a
disease or anything.

35:58.155 --> 36:02.451
I'm just not gonna sleep with
anyone till after I'm married.

36:02.535 --> 36:04.871
{\an3}So if you want to
bail out or...

36:04.954 --> 36:08.416
{\an3}or just be friends
or whatever...

36:08.499 --> 36:10.877
{\an3}I don't know,
it's up to you.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.045
I mean, if it's too weird.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.548
{\an1}Well, it's
kind of weird, but...

36:17.216 --> 36:18.926
Yeah.

36:19.010 --> 36:22.430
{\an3}That's why I
wanted you to know.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.599
{\an1}Look, Donna,
I came back tonight

36:24.682 --> 36:27.602
{\an1}because all that mattered
was seeing you again,

36:27.685 --> 36:30.104
and that's still
all that matters.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.927
{\an5}(knocking on window)
BOY:
Hey!

37:01.010 --> 37:02.595
Hey, man!

37:04.013 --> 37:05.139
Look, save it.

37:05.222 --> 37:08.643
Look, his girlfriend's the one
that gave us the money anyway,

37:08.726 --> 37:09.977
and she hit the road.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.979
You guys... take these.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.814
You can head off that way.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.900
{\an1}Me and you go
around back, cowboy.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.906
(eggs splatting)

37:25.952 --> 37:28.037
Hey, get the hell out of here!

37:28.120 --> 37:30.164
(eggs splatting)

37:35.920 --> 37:37.004
{\an3}I said get!

37:37.088 --> 37:39.173
{\an1}He's got a gun!
Run, man!

37:39.257 --> 37:41.342
Yeah, keep running!

37:54.063 --> 37:56.357
What are you laughing at?

38:07.785 --> 38:08.953
Now...

38:09.036 --> 38:12.081
{\an1}I hope <i> we</i> can get some sleep
before she wakes up again.

38:12.164 --> 38:13.916
{\an3}You think your parents
were offended

38:14.000 --> 38:15.376
that we didn't stay longer?

38:15.459 --> 38:17.628
Nah. Are you kidding?

38:17.712 --> 38:19.380
{\an3}Listen, it meant
a lot to them

38:19.463 --> 38:20.756
that we came
with Hannah.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.675
Yeah, well, it did to me, too.

38:24.176 --> 38:25.886
That's why...

38:25.970 --> 38:27.346
Jesse, I'd...

38:27.430 --> 38:30.016
I don't want to say
this the wrong way.

38:30.099 --> 38:31.559
Why? What is it?

38:31.642 --> 38:34.854
{\an1}I think it's important
that Hannah grows up

38:34.937 --> 38:37.440
feeling connected to your family
and your heritage--

38:37.523 --> 38:39.984
{\an1}and, I mean that,
I really do-- but...

38:41.402 --> 38:43.571
Jesse, she's Jewish.

38:43.654 --> 38:45.948
(laughs):
Oh, geez.

38:46.032 --> 38:48.159
I thought we went over all this.

38:48.242 --> 38:49.785
Well, so did I, but...

38:49.869 --> 38:53.164
Look, I don't mind seeing this
hanging in a store window--

38:53.247 --> 38:56.208
I don't-- but on our daughter...

38:57.293 --> 38:58.919
Jesse, you have to understand

38:59.003 --> 39:01.172
this isn't just
a piece of jewelry to me.

39:01.255 --> 39:06.719
I know. I mean, it's not just a
piece of jewelry to me, either.

39:06.802 --> 39:09.263
{\an1}I've been thinking
about this all evening.

39:09.346 --> 39:12.266
{\an1}You can't be
Jewish and Catholic.

39:12.349 --> 39:13.976
But Hannah is.

39:14.060 --> 39:16.145
But what does that mean?

39:17.563 --> 39:19.106
{\an3}Look...

39:19.190 --> 39:22.068
{\an3}I know we're not the first
people to wonder about this,

39:22.151 --> 39:23.944
but we'll find
out, won't we?

39:24.028 --> 39:25.112
The three of us.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.114
Just maybe not tonight.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.283
Well, when?

39:32.495 --> 39:34.455
(door opens)

39:34.538 --> 39:37.458
{\an1}You know, if we
did find Martians,

39:37.541 --> 39:40.461
{\an1}I don't think I could've
shared you with them.

39:40.544 --> 39:42.463
{\an3}You know, I think
that's the nicest thing

39:42.546 --> 39:44.673
anyone's ever said to me.

39:44.757 --> 39:45.674
Really?

39:45.758 --> 39:46.801
Mm-mm.

39:48.552 --> 39:49.804
Um...

39:49.887 --> 39:53.015
{\an3}Just so I can...
plan my night,

39:53.099 --> 39:55.017
do you have...?

39:55.101 --> 39:56.102
Yeah,

39:56.185 --> 39:58.062
I've got about, uh...

39:58.145 --> 40:00.731
200 of these left
from high school.

40:00.815 --> 40:03.776
Well, that should get
us through the night.

40:04.860 --> 40:07.154
{\an3}I mean, I'm glad
we're here.

40:07.238 --> 40:10.199
{\an3}I didn't want our
first time to be...

40:10.282 --> 40:12.326
getting drunk at
some frat party

40:12.409 --> 40:15.371
{\an3}and then waking up
together in the morning.

40:25.381 --> 40:27.800
What?

40:27.883 --> 40:31.303
{\an1}I don't know, I just
thought I felt something.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.180
That would be me.

40:33.264 --> 40:37.643
{\an3}And I think I deserve
your undivided attention.

40:48.362 --> 40:53.284
{\an5}(music reminiscent of
<i>Close Encounters of</i>
<i>the Third Kind</i> theme plays)

41:00.708 --> 41:02.376
(whooshes)

41:02.460 --> 41:05.171
{\an3}Dylan?

41:05.254 --> 41:07.715
Dylan? Come on, man.

41:07.798 --> 41:09.341
Come on. Dylan.

41:09.425 --> 41:11.260
Hey. Come on, wake up.

41:11.343 --> 41:13.262
Wake up. Hey, hey,
hey, hey, come on.

41:13.345 --> 41:16.056
{\an3}Come on, let's walk around
a little bit here, huh?

41:16.140 --> 41:17.641
I'm fine!

41:19.059 --> 41:22.104
What, you think I OD'd?
I was asleep.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.231
{\an3}You must be a
heavy sleeper--

41:24.315 --> 41:26.442
{\an3}It took me two minutes
to wake you up.

41:26.525 --> 41:28.694
I was very tired.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.112
(coughing)

41:30.196 --> 41:32.531
{\an3}Big day shooting
up the house?

41:32.615 --> 41:34.241
(sniffles)

41:34.325 --> 41:36.911
What house?
This isn't my house.

41:36.994 --> 41:39.246
I don't got a house.

41:39.330 --> 41:42.082
(sighs):
Where's my gun?

41:42.166 --> 41:43.209
{\an3}Look,

41:43.292 --> 41:46.086
{\an3}Dylan, I know Kevin and
Suzanne ripped you off, man,

41:46.170 --> 41:47.963
{\an3}but you got to
get over it.

41:48.047 --> 41:51.383
{\an1}Yeah, I'll get over it
first thing in the morning.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.761
{\an3}All right, fine, then,
don't get over it,

41:53.844 --> 41:56.263
{\an3}but do something besides
just getting wasted every day.

41:56.347 --> 41:57.890
I mean, what are
you saying, man,

41:57.973 --> 42:00.267
{\an3}that there was never anything
more to you than money?

42:00.351 --> 42:02.853
{\an1}Don't, don't come over here
after two months

42:02.937 --> 42:04.355
and start analyzing me!

42:04.438 --> 42:05.773
What do you know?

42:05.856 --> 42:08.817
How do you get so wise
to come over here, man?

42:08.901 --> 42:12.112
Y-You live at home.

42:12.196 --> 42:14.073
You live the most coddled
existence of anybody that

42:14.156 --> 42:16.533
I know of, and yet you'll
come in here and tell me

42:16.617 --> 42:19.078
that you have some idea
as to what I'm going through?

42:19.161 --> 42:20.829
Man, you have no idea!

42:20.913 --> 42:23.082
Don't turn this around, man--
this ain't about me.

42:23.165 --> 42:24.333
{\an1}No, it ain't
never about you,

42:24.416 --> 42:25.459
is it, Brandon?

42:25.542 --> 42:26.627
Brenda's got guts, man.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.254
She had the guts--
she moved away

42:28.337 --> 42:30.464
to another continent
just to get away from you.

42:30.547 --> 42:32.967
(laughs):
Dylan, at this point in time,

42:33.050 --> 42:34.677
I'm about
the only friend you've got--

42:34.760 --> 42:36.720
are you sure
you want to do this?

42:36.804 --> 42:38.138
(panting)

42:38.222 --> 42:40.474
May the bridges I burn
light the way.

42:40.557 --> 42:42.601
Okay.

42:44.270 --> 42:45.980
Don't take my gun.

42:46.063 --> 42:48.023
If you walk out
of here with it,

42:48.107 --> 42:49.275
{\an1}I'll call
the cops myself.

42:49.358 --> 42:52.653
{\an3}Go ahead-- my license
number's 3E5503.

42:52.736 --> 42:54.905
You want me to write it down?

42:54.989 --> 42:57.157
Just get out.

42:57.241 --> 42:58.659
{\an1}(coughs)

42:58.742 --> 43:00.244
Get out!

43:01.245 --> 43:02.288
(door slams)
