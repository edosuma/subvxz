WEBVTT

00:18.286 --> 00:19.720
- Josh: Hey.
- Sarah: What's going on?

00:19.787 --> 00:21.189
Where is she?

00:21.255 --> 00:23.124
She's in the back breaking
child labor laws.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.692
What is so urgent?

00:24.758 --> 00:26.127
Shelly: Your grandma

00:26.194 --> 00:28.796
might just become
an elected official.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.831
Hi, Joshie.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.600
- Hi.
- Hi. Come here, tushy.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.402
- Can we talk?
- Oh, hi, baby doll.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.437
Hey, Sarie,
did you tell Joshie

00:36.504 --> 00:38.606
that I'm running for a seat
on the condo board?

00:38.672 --> 00:41.041
- Hey, I need to talk to you.
- I haven't had a chance yet.

00:41.109 --> 00:43.144
And I am putting
these monsters to work.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.612
I'm building my campaign

00:44.678 --> 00:47.415
around cleaning up
that horrendous duck pond.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.317
- Mom.
- She's, uh--

00:49.383 --> 00:51.519
You're not gonna--
You're just going to
have to spit it out.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.387
Your task, should you
choose to accept it--

00:53.454 --> 00:55.256
- Hey!
- ...is that you--

00:55.323 --> 00:58.859
I need to speak to you
not in front of children.

00:58.926 --> 01:01.695
You want to do this right here,
or do you want to--

01:06.900 --> 01:08.469
** [theme]

01:54.315 --> 01:56.650
I forgot. I forgot.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.085
You forgot?

01:58.186 --> 01:59.187
Yeah.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.421
That I had a kid?

02:00.488 --> 02:02.290
Mom, you have known
about Colton

02:02.356 --> 02:04.057
- for 17 years.
- Oh, please.

02:04.192 --> 02:05.659
I mean, other things
were going on.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.362
Every day you kids had
some mishegoss or another.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.863
And your father
was diddly--

02:09.930 --> 02:11.965
doing God knows what
at that cross-dressing camp.

02:12.032 --> 02:14.535
I was-- I was all alone.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.470
I can't
get those years back.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.806
You don't seem
to understand that.

02:20.208 --> 02:24.345
I put Colton out of my mind.

02:24.412 --> 02:27.715
I put him out of our world

02:27.781 --> 02:29.317
to protect you, Josh.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.885
You have no idea
how difficult it is

02:31.952 --> 02:33.287
to be a parent, right, Sarie?

02:33.354 --> 02:36.056
Wow. Okay. Okay.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.525
Okay.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.362
You think
I was so terrible?

02:41.429 --> 02:44.232
I didn't beat you.

02:44.265 --> 02:47.000
I kept you fed.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.669
You had a credit card.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.539
You had a credit card.
You know-- Wait.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.975
Other people throw
babies in dumpsters.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.244
They raise kids, right?

02:56.244 --> 02:58.479
They raise kids in closets.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.714
You guys had it pretty good.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.950
I'm sorry. I have
to go take a shower.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.918
Oh, now she's
going to go out.

03:10.758 --> 03:11.792
I love you.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.933
Ali: It ends with
an essay question.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.869
And the prompts?
Look at them.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.637
They are, I mean, dumb.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.706
"Please expand upon the way
your work relates to society

03:25.773 --> 03:27.675
in a larger
historical context."

03:27.741 --> 03:28.709
[hawking]

03:28.776 --> 03:30.944
Okay.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.480
What about this?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.815
What if you replace
the word "work"

03:34.882 --> 03:36.083
with the word "cunt"?

03:36.149 --> 03:37.485
Then you have
a really great essay.

03:37.551 --> 03:40.921
You mean like
"Please expand upon the way

03:40.988 --> 03:43.090
your cunt relates to society."

03:43.156 --> 03:44.992
By Ali Pfefferman.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.360
[groan]

03:46.427 --> 03:49.730
Should I be asking Leslie
what she thinks?

03:49.797 --> 03:51.532
I mean, yeah,

03:51.599 --> 03:53.367
I'm sure she has a lot
of opinions about your cunt.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.135
You know, it couldn't
hurt to ask her, right?

03:55.202 --> 03:58.706
Or it could hurt
to ask her,

03:58.772 --> 04:00.708
and I should just be,
like,

04:00.774 --> 04:02.743
a serious,
independent thinker

04:02.810 --> 04:05.346
who wants to go
to graduate school.

04:07.214 --> 04:08.316
All right.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.983
Run it by me.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.519
Okay.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.454
Okay,
so there's this thing

04:13.521 --> 04:14.755
that I've been Googling

04:14.822 --> 04:16.424
that I think
is super interesting,

04:16.490 --> 04:18.392
which is called--
which are called Jew shoes.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.193
You're wowing me.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.962
I'm not telling you.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.163
No, just tell me.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.332
You are not--

04:24.332 --> 04:25.766
No, no, no, no.
Okay, Jew shoes.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.201
Jew shoes. It's a real thing
from back in the old days

04:28.336 --> 04:29.470
where they used to make
Jewish women

04:29.537 --> 04:30.738
wear these horrible shoes.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.373
One was red,
and one was black,

04:32.440 --> 04:33.707
and they had bells on them

04:33.774 --> 04:35.609
so that you could
hear them coming.

04:35.676 --> 04:36.977
That's what your essay's
going to be about?

04:37.044 --> 04:38.512
Yes.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.680
No?

04:39.747 --> 04:41.715
It shouldn't be
about that?

04:45.353 --> 04:48.389
Well, now I'm
completely embarrassed.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.624
Well, you should be.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.561
Well-- [scoff]--
I think you should be.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.429
Come on.
It's a great idea.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.197
I think you're the one
who's really embarrassed.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.667
By what? I can't think
of one thing you could
do to embarrass me.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.769
I think this situation here
really embarrasses you--

05:01.835 --> 05:02.870
No. God, I just--

05:02.936 --> 05:05.406
I think especially
when I do that. Mm!

05:05.473 --> 05:06.740
It really
embarrasses you.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.208
- I don't think so.
- So much, it--

05:08.275 --> 05:09.810
[grunt] Embarrassing!

05:09.877 --> 05:10.844
Stop it. Stop--

05:10.911 --> 05:12.880
Ow! Ha ha ha ha!

05:12.946 --> 05:14.382
Ow.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.484
Raquel:
My mom is the same way.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.386
She just does not admit shit.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.988
It's hard because
you're looking for a parent,

05:21.054 --> 05:22.390
and they're just not--

05:22.423 --> 05:24.492
Oh, I'm not even
looking for a parent.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.759
I'm just looking for
a fucking human being.

05:25.826 --> 05:26.827
- Oh, honey.
- You know?

05:26.894 --> 05:28.396
Like, how ridiculous
would it be

05:28.429 --> 05:29.697
if they actually
told the truth?

05:29.763 --> 05:31.031
- Like--
- I know.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.232
I can't stop thinking

05:32.299 --> 05:33.534
about
what it would be like

05:33.601 --> 05:35.168
if they hadn't
fucked with my life.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.770
I guess one could argue

05:36.837 --> 05:41.909
that if they hadn't
lied to you...

05:41.975 --> 05:45.178
that maybe you wouldn't
be in this room

05:45.245 --> 05:49.082
trying to fold
your T-shirts across--

05:49.149 --> 05:52.986
From-- From the most amazing
human being that I've ever met,

05:53.053 --> 05:58.125
who is inspiring a huge
boner in me right now.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.928
Your Honor, permission

06:00.994 --> 06:03.864
for said boner
to approach the bench.

06:03.931 --> 06:07.100
May-- May--
May I, Your Highness?

06:07.167 --> 06:08.836
I think-- [laughing]

06:12.339 --> 06:14.107
Um...

06:14.174 --> 06:15.509
babe, uh, there's some--

06:15.576 --> 06:16.844
something's on your back.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.546
- Want me on my back?
- No, no, no, no.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.448
It's just like
some spots or something,

06:20.514 --> 06:21.649
- but it kind of--
- Where?

06:21.715 --> 06:24.151
...mm, looks a little bit
like measles.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.519
Maybe it's measles.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.120
There's no measles,
but I'm just saying--

06:27.187 --> 06:28.456
God, it's, like, everywhere.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.690
It's probably
something that you ate

06:29.757 --> 06:30.924
because
it looks like a rash

06:30.991 --> 06:32.693
or, you know, people
have a reaction--

06:32.760 --> 06:34.595
Let me call Dr. Susan
just because I don't know--

06:34.662 --> 06:37.097
Don't touch them. I don't
want to be contagious.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.098
All right. Okay.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.232
Oof. Well, that was hot.

06:39.299 --> 06:40.501
Oh, it's hot.

06:40.568 --> 06:43.103
I'm going to get up
all over that rash.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.473
I'm going
to get up on it.

06:45.539 --> 06:46.974
Maura: You understand
what I'm saying?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.476
Shea:
Yes. I do understand.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.843
Just overlap a little bit.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.579
Okay, so you want
to do another layer?

06:51.645 --> 06:52.580
- Or not?
- I think we should.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.581
I think-- Really?

06:53.647 --> 06:54.815
Can you hand me a noodle?

06:54.882 --> 06:57.117
I never thought I would
live to say that.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.987
So, um, I told you
that I went to Dr. Venti--

07:00.053 --> 07:03.657
I cannot say that doctor's
name. Ventmiglia.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.860
And she gave me
this drug called Lupron.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.161
- It's a T blocker.
- Uh-huh.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.229
It's a testosterone
blocker.

07:09.296 --> 07:10.531
Oh, like Spironolactone.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.032
- Yes.
- So she said

07:12.099 --> 07:14.334
that I might have
less of a sex drive.

07:14.401 --> 07:15.936
That's one possible
side effect,

07:16.003 --> 07:17.771
but also my body hair
might thin,

07:17.838 --> 07:19.106
and I will soften out.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.608
- Yes. That's exactly--
- Is that all true?

07:20.674 --> 07:22.743
Well, yeah, and you
got to be careful.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.244
- Why?
- Well, because

07:24.311 --> 07:25.979
it's possible
things might not work

07:26.046 --> 07:28.081
as well as they used to work.
Do you know what I mean?

07:28.148 --> 07:29.382
- Yes. I understand.
- So just be careful.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.251
I'd rather be
horny and hairy,

07:31.318 --> 07:32.419
- quite frankly.
- Yeah.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.854
Well, you're just saying that

07:33.921 --> 07:35.589
because your man's
getting out.

07:35.656 --> 07:36.957
- That's true.
- Well, I'm good with that.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.859
I'm just focusing
on...

07:38.926 --> 07:39.960
moi.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.595
Good. You don't
need to be focused

07:41.662 --> 07:43.063
on anyone but yourself
right now.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.965
Are we layering these
the right way?

07:45.032 --> 07:46.266
Yeah,
but you have to put--

07:46.333 --> 07:47.568
Yes, yes.
It looks great.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.970
Basil there and basil there.
That's good.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.271
I have a question.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.040
Is it okay to stay
in the turret

07:53.106 --> 07:54.542
- when Sal's here?
- Of course it is.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.976
Why would you even ask
something like that?

07:56.043 --> 07:57.778
- Don't start that.
- Because I don't know.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.079
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.114
Maybe you and Sal
want to have more--

08:01.181 --> 08:03.183
- We'll be fine.
- ...room to express yourself,

08:03.250 --> 08:04.918
- if you know what I mean?
- Don't worry about it.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.554
- It's going to be fine.
- * Bow chika wow wow *

08:06.554 --> 08:07.788
This is where you live now.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.189
Just don't bring up politics

08:09.256 --> 08:11.058
- because his might--
- I have no politics.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.392
- It's time to pick up--
- I got to see if--

08:12.459 --> 08:13.594
Yeah, go get cunt.

08:13.661 --> 08:14.995
...upside-down
for a couple of days.

08:15.062 --> 08:17.097
Time to pick up those
who are incarcerated.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.866
- Yeah. And get cunt.
- What did you just say?

08:18.932 --> 08:20.701
Go get cunt?
Is that a phrase?

08:20.768 --> 08:21.869
Time to get cunt, you know.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.271
Wow.
That's sort of blunt

08:24.337 --> 08:25.773
and yet to the point.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.841
Yeah, but I-- I woke up
this morning. I saw this,

08:27.908 --> 08:29.843
and I thought I should--
We should just check it out

08:29.910 --> 08:31.411
because this is so gross.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.846
You know,
it really looks more

08:32.913 --> 08:34.782
like an allergic reaction
to something you ate.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.083
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.751
- Josh: Oh.
- Yeah, like hives, maybe.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.086
- Okay.
- So I'm going to go ahead

08:39.152 --> 08:41.288
and draw some blood
as a precautionary measure.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.422
Oh, thank you so much.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.024
Test for measle
antibodies

08:44.091 --> 08:46.594
because I don't have a record
of you getting a booster shot.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.161
I'll just need you to stay
out of public places,

08:48.228 --> 08:50.463
you know, like airports,
shopping malls--

08:50.598 --> 08:54.467
Fine. So if you see anything
in terms of who's in there,

08:54.602 --> 08:55.769
do not say a word to us.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.404
- Oh, okay.
- We do not want to know.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.772
We want to be surprised.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.173
- Okay.
- Don't want to know the sex.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.174
Okay.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.076
Oh.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.212
Where are you, Corn Nut?

09:05.278 --> 09:07.615
Come out, come out.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.150
Okay.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.753
- Everything okay?
- Did you--

09:12.820 --> 09:14.722
I'm just going to go
get the doctor, okay?

09:14.788 --> 09:15.989
I'll be right back, you guys.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.424
The last time
that we were in here,

09:17.490 --> 09:19.326
we heard the--
the swishing happens.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.628
Right. I'll just
be right back.

09:20.628 --> 09:21.929
We were going to record it.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.476
How long does it take
to exit a prison?

09:36.543 --> 09:38.679
I mean,
he has nothing to pack.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.080
You think they'll
miss one little--

09:40.147 --> 09:43.550
Don't ruin the
presentation for Sal.

09:43.651 --> 09:44.952
[chatter]

09:45.018 --> 09:47.187
It's going to cost,
like, 20 grand.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.889
- 20 grand?
- Yeah, and I said "Fuck it.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.557
"Let's just call the plumber

09:50.658 --> 09:51.959
and stick a pipeline
through it."

09:52.025 --> 09:53.560
No one makes a fool
out of my girl, huh?

09:53.661 --> 09:55.528
- Mm.
- Shea: Hey, hey, hey.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.130
- Mm.
- [Shea chuckles]

09:57.197 --> 09:58.465
- Uh--
- Hi.

09:58.531 --> 09:59.532
Oh, look.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.101
- Hey, Shea.
- Hi, honey.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.103
Oh, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.838
- How are you?
- Good, good.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.239
- Good?
- Been a long time.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.641
Honey, this is Maura.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.142
- Oh, Maura.
- Hi. How are you?

10:09.209 --> 10:10.744
I've heard so much
about you,

10:10.811 --> 10:12.279
and thank you for
letting me stay here.

10:12.345 --> 10:13.714
It means a lot to me.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.082
Oh, you're not going
to hear me complaining

10:15.148 --> 10:18.051
about a bevy of broads
in my house, huh?

10:18.118 --> 10:21.021
We're so excited.
We made you a lasagna

10:21.088 --> 10:23.757
because we know
you like it.

10:23.824 --> 10:27.795
Yeah, uh, we--
we stopped, and we just--

10:27.861 --> 10:28.896
we got a little chicken.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.163
You see, he wanted
some chicken.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.165
Been craving some
chicken and Davina

10:32.232 --> 10:33.566
- for quite some time.
- Yeah.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.202
Shea: I bet.

10:36.670 --> 10:37.738
Let's go to bed.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.106
We're going
to head upstairs.

10:39.172 --> 10:39.907
Yeah.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.108
Do you want some wine?

10:41.174 --> 10:42.609
- Okay.
- The wine we will take.

10:42.676 --> 10:43.744
- Yes.
- Yeah.

10:43.811 --> 10:44.945
Thank you, Maura.
Thank you.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.279
Shea,
good seeing you again.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.614
I mean, you know--

10:47.681 --> 10:48.849
- Good night.
- Head upstairs.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.184
- Celebrate.
- Do you want glasses?

10:51.251 --> 10:53.320
That was abrupt.

10:53.386 --> 10:56.156
Yeah. He's short.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.033
I wish you didn't
have to go through that.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.737
We'll just try again

11:09.770 --> 11:11.739
because apparently,
like, it's actually--

11:11.772 --> 11:13.306
the easiest time
to get pregnant

11:13.373 --> 11:16.376
is the first six months after
you've already been pregnant.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.745
So this is, like, now,

11:17.811 --> 11:20.080
and then it gets to be
difficult again,

11:20.147 --> 11:22.750
so now we should--
this is when we do it again.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.484
I mean, not like today.

11:24.551 --> 11:27.320
But we-- we do it again.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.822
Yeah.

11:31.759 --> 11:35.262
Or we could just
take this moment

11:35.328 --> 11:40.000
to just, like, just
breathe for a second.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.301
You know what I mean?

11:41.368 --> 11:42.602
I feel like I haven't
had a chance

11:42.669 --> 11:44.237
to, like, breathe

11:44.304 --> 11:47.007
with all this shit
going on.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.643
Well, like,
we're engaged, Josh.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.512
We're, like, in it.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.181
Like--

11:54.247 --> 11:55.515
- Yeah.
- Right?

11:55.582 --> 11:57.450
I know. I know. I know.

11:57.517 --> 11:58.919
I just-- I'm just saying

11:58.986 --> 12:02.322
we've-- This has been
a whirlwind, and--

12:02.389 --> 12:04.858
- Yeah.
- ...I--

12:04.925 --> 12:07.227
I just want
to take a moment

12:07.294 --> 12:09.897
and just, like, think
about what we're doing

12:09.963 --> 12:11.164
and make a plan,

12:11.231 --> 12:13.100
and we have a chance
to do it right.

12:13.166 --> 12:16.103
You know what I'm s--
That's all I'm saying.

12:18.338 --> 12:21.508
I, uh, I-- I want--
I want a baby.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.675
I know.

12:22.810 --> 12:23.944
I don't have, like,
a lot of time.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.446
Actually, like, I feel like

12:26.513 --> 12:28.181
I want-- want this.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.917
I want this. I do.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.618
- Do you want this?
- I do.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.486
I just need

12:33.553 --> 12:35.388
just, like,
not right now,

12:35.455 --> 12:37.057
not right this second.

12:37.124 --> 12:40.660
I just-- I'm trying
to be truthful

12:40.727 --> 12:41.995
about...

12:42.062 --> 12:44.597
- Okay.
- ...what is going on with me,

12:44.664 --> 12:47.100
and I think that's
what we want, right?

12:47.167 --> 12:49.569
- Yeah.
- We want to be truthful.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.171
Yeah.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.142
Thank you for being honest.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.011
- Okay. Good?
- Yes.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.980
- Okay, good.
- Great.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.916
All right,
I'm going to, uh...

13:02.983 --> 13:05.285
I'm going to draw a bath
for you, okay?

13:05.352 --> 13:07.120
Okay. Okay.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.869
[knocking]

13:27.707 --> 13:28.876
Hello?

13:28.942 --> 13:30.577
Leslie: I'm up here.

13:31.678 --> 13:32.880
Okay.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.716
Hi.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.418
Come on up.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.654
Thank you so much for
agreeing to help me out.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.090
I'm sure people are

13:43.156 --> 13:45.258
always bothering you
with that.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.526
Yeah.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.162
[loud moaning]

13:51.098 --> 13:52.565
You sure this is a good time?

13:52.632 --> 13:54.401
Because I can come any time.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.204
No, no. I'm just trying
to come up with these clips

13:57.270 --> 13:59.439
to run as background
when I read some poems

13:59.506 --> 14:02.209
up at the Anawalt
Womyn's Music Festival.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.277
Right, yeah.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.279
Syd and I just got
tickets to that.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.314
We can't wait.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.482
Oh, yeah. It's four days
of fresh air

14:09.549 --> 14:13.553
and cowboy coffee
and a forest full of tits.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.922
Yeah.

14:14.922 --> 14:18.058
Rumor has it that this
might be the last year.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.492
[moaning continues]

14:19.559 --> 14:21.594
You have a lot of great
pieces up here.

14:21.661 --> 14:22.963
Hey, you know what?

14:23.030 --> 14:24.932
Why don't you go downstairs
and get some wine?

14:24.932 --> 14:26.099
Great.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.434
I'll be down
in just a minute.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.969
It's right on
the kitchen counter.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.537
It's right next
to the cat crack.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.139
Perfect. Thank you.

14:47.587 --> 14:50.723
Oh, Christ. I never want
to see another pussy

14:50.790 --> 14:52.993
as long as I live.

14:53.060 --> 14:56.329
Just kidding.
Maybe a week.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.766
Uh, I don't know if I
could go that long.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.002
At my age, the Rolodex
of the brain

15:02.069 --> 15:04.204
is sometimes better
than the real deal.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.606
Yeah, I totally get that.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.608
You want to get
in my barrel?

15:08.675 --> 15:10.543
What is a barrel?

15:10.610 --> 15:14.581
It is a hot tub. My back
is fucking killing me.

15:14.647 --> 15:18.251
Okay, a whole variety
of things here.

15:18.318 --> 15:21.188
PB&J, Hot Pockets,
hot chocolate.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.723
A little mini buffet.

15:23.790 --> 15:24.824
Thank you.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.293
Uh, so I was thinking.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.495
I don't have to go
to this thing tonight.

15:28.561 --> 15:29.562
No, it's fine.

15:29.629 --> 15:30.763
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:30.830 --> 15:34.067
All right. There will be
some important people there.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.668
Well, then you should go.

15:37.504 --> 15:38.471
Okay.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.073
Well, um, you know,

15:40.140 --> 15:42.109
you should watch, like,
some stupid TV or something,

15:42.175 --> 15:44.344
you know? Just, like,
take your mind off yourself.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.512
Yeah.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.448
Thank you.

15:48.515 --> 15:49.782
Yeah.

15:49.849 --> 15:51.051
All right.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.486
I'll see you later, okay?

15:57.657 --> 15:59.459
[keys jingle]

16:04.297 --> 16:05.865
Well, well, well.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.700
Look what the cat
dragged in.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.236
- Hi.
- You look great.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.203
Thanks.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.804
Hey, sorry.
Pilates ran long.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.073
I just got to grab
a shower.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.507
Okay. Actually,
I'm so exhausted,

16:14.574 --> 16:16.743
I thought maybe we could
just stay in and hang out.

16:16.809 --> 16:17.944
Would that be cool?

16:18.045 --> 16:20.380
Oh. AKA you're horny?

16:20.447 --> 16:21.414
Shut up.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.250
Yeah. Well,
I'll still shower

16:23.316 --> 16:24.551
unless
you want me dirty.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.419
No. That's cool.
I'll Yelp some food.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.189
All right, let's get it on.

16:32.259 --> 16:33.626
Ohh.

16:33.693 --> 16:37.430
Do you think I'm, like,
easy for staying in?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.299
Not at all.
Are you kidding?

16:39.366 --> 16:41.068
I'm so glad
we're doing this.

16:41.134 --> 16:45.138
You think I'm, like--
like, um, like a slut?

16:45.205 --> 16:46.539
[chuckle] No.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.208
I don't think
you're a slut at all.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.443
I think you're just
sexually amazing.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.714
But, like,
what if I am a slut?

16:54.781 --> 16:56.083
Hang on. What?

16:56.116 --> 16:57.784
Okay. [laughing]

16:57.850 --> 16:59.186
Okay, I'm trying to--

16:59.252 --> 17:01.088
I'm sorry. I'm trying
to tell you something,

17:01.154 --> 17:03.690
and I'm not doing it well.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.226
Hey, you know what? I'm going
to stop you right here.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.761
I know what this is.
You got herpes.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.297
- Right?
- No.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.731
- It's, like, no big deal.
- No, I don't.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.166
It's, like not anything
to be ashamed of.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.102
I don't have herpes.
I have a fantasy.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.103
- Oh.
- I--

17:16.136 --> 17:17.737
I'm trying to--

17:17.804 --> 17:19.172
What's the fantasy?

17:19.239 --> 17:21.674
Like, um, okay.

17:21.741 --> 17:25.378
Okay, so there's this guy
from my high school.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.348
Okay.
High school fantasy.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.118
His name's Mr. Irons.
That's actually his name.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.585
Okay.
Teacher or something?

17:32.652 --> 17:34.954
Actually, his title
was disciplinarian.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.623
Wow.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.925
So he walks around
with this, like--

17:38.991 --> 17:42.129
We-- Our hall passes
were wooden paddles.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.863
- Oh.
- And, like, he'd get really--

17:43.930 --> 17:45.132
I can see
where this is going.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.299
...get really mad at you

17:46.366 --> 17:48.201
if you didn't
have your hall pass.

17:48.268 --> 17:51.771
Do you, like,
want to play him?

17:51.838 --> 17:52.872
Yeah. Tell me what to do.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.774
All right. Sit down.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.609
All right.

17:56.676 --> 18:00.213
Sit down like you're
at your desk.

18:04.050 --> 18:06.653
And there's, like,
a glass window here.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.054
[phone buzzes]

18:08.155 --> 18:09.156
And--

18:09.156 --> 18:10.490
[buzz]

18:10.557 --> 18:13.360
You can, um,
you can see me.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.062
And I don't have my--
I don't have my hall pass--

18:16.163 --> 18:18.064
Uh-oh.
You're in trouble now.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.532
...in my hand,

18:19.599 --> 18:22.302
so, like, I'm walking
down the hall.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.171
[high voice]
Yoo-hoo!

18:24.204 --> 18:26.573
Young lady!

18:26.639 --> 18:28.941
I already know
that voice was wrong.

18:29.008 --> 18:30.310
Yeah. I'm sorry.

18:30.377 --> 18:32.011
I tried something,
but it didn't work.

18:32.078 --> 18:34.181
Something
like less Julia Child.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.182
[buzz]

18:35.248 --> 18:36.449
Okay, so more like my voice?

18:36.516 --> 18:37.817
- Sorry.
- You are blowing up.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.051
I know, I know, I know. Sorry.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.287
[buzz, beep]

18:40.353 --> 18:41.788
- It's my mom.
- Okay.

18:41.854 --> 18:42.855
- Mom.
- Hi.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.291
What's up?

18:44.357 --> 18:46.759
Mom. Mom, breathe.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.495
Rela-- Are you crying?

18:48.561 --> 18:49.862
** [techno beat]

18:49.929 --> 18:51.198
[chatter]

18:54.567 --> 18:55.935
Oh, shit.

18:56.002 --> 18:57.204
Oh, shit.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.271
Yo.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.006
I'm going to shoot
those photos.

19:00.072 --> 19:01.841
I should have hit you back.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.210
When I yell "Marty,"

19:03.276 --> 19:05.245
you pick up el telefono,
dog.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.414
[chatter]

19:17.757 --> 19:18.858
Joshie. What's up, baby?

19:18.925 --> 19:20.126
Jesus. Fuck.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.394
- How are you, man?
- I'm good.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.829
I haven't seen you
in a minute.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.631
- I know, I know.
- What have you been up to?

19:24.697 --> 19:26.433
Just working on
the sneaker line, man.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.235
- Check this out.
- You're making sneakers.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.236
I am making sneakers.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.937
Will we work
with the girls?

19:31.003 --> 19:33.005
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do it.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.641
- Do it.
- Good seeing you.

19:34.707 --> 19:35.875
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.112
- There he is.
- Hey.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.948
Bring it in, dog.
Bring it in.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.583
Oh, I feel good.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.518
I listened to the whole
polished DP today,

19:45.585 --> 19:46.819
and I just love it
so much, man,

19:46.886 --> 19:48.755
I want to give it
a prostate massage.

19:48.821 --> 19:49.956
Okay, we need to talk.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.358
You okay?

19:52.325 --> 19:53.460
What happened?

19:53.526 --> 19:54.594
What?

19:54.661 --> 19:56.596
You're scaring me,
man.

19:57.930 --> 20:02.902
Fussy Puss and you and me
and our own label.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.706
[laughing]

20:06.773 --> 20:10.543
Say yes
to your fucking dreams.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.880
I love that idea.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.915
Let's get fucked up.

20:22.322 --> 20:25.057
You know
what really kills me

20:25.124 --> 20:28.295
is when men
want to acknowledge

20:28.361 --> 20:29.862
female superiority.

20:29.929 --> 20:30.863
[scoff]

20:30.930 --> 20:33.400
And it is like
"Fuck you, buddy.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.868
You're still trying
to own the conversation."

20:35.935 --> 20:38.271
This guy in my astronomy
class just the other day

20:38.338 --> 20:40.773
was like "I am totally into

20:40.840 --> 20:42.975
"and supportive of seeing
women in the sciences

20:43.042 --> 20:44.076
in equal numbers."

20:44.143 --> 20:45.845
It's like
"Fuck you, asshole.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.681
"We don't need
your permission. Thanks.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.650
Thanks so much."

20:57.424 --> 20:59.025
Woman: Bean!

20:59.091 --> 21:00.693
Bean!

21:00.760 --> 21:02.228
What?

21:02.329 --> 21:03.863
You didn't bring
the orchid food back.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.332
Shit.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.733
Sorry.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.968
Who's that in
the hot tub with you?

21:09.035 --> 21:10.770
Is that Sheila?

21:12.138 --> 21:13.340
- No!
- Sheila?

21:13.340 --> 21:14.974
Honey, just go to bed.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.343
Okay. Good night.

21:18.345 --> 21:19.979
Um...

21:20.046 --> 21:22.014
I have a couple of questions.

21:32.091 --> 21:34.461
So tell me about
your admissions essay.

21:34.527 --> 21:37.797
Okay. So I have this notion--

21:37.864 --> 21:38.731
Uh-huh.

21:38.798 --> 21:43.135
That there is something
connected

21:43.202 --> 21:45.372
with...

21:45.405 --> 21:48.575
the women thing
and the Jew thing.

21:48.641 --> 21:53.546
It's like phallus
is to crucifix

21:53.613 --> 21:57.216
as vagina is to Holocaust.

21:57.283 --> 21:58.718
Uh-huh.

22:00.387 --> 22:01.888
But you know, the thing

22:01.954 --> 22:04.223
that we really hate
in admission essays

22:04.290 --> 22:08.094
is just a bunch of--
of boring theory,

22:08.160 --> 22:09.862
just theory-- uh-uh.

22:09.929 --> 22:10.930
Personal stuff?

22:12.264 --> 22:14.401
That's always going
to be the way to go.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.438
Okay.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.309
There's this thing
with my family.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.678
You know how
my parent is trans.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.680
I sure do.

22:27.747 --> 22:30.850
They have this weird
rift with their family

22:30.917 --> 22:32.485
that I'm obsessed with
right now.

22:32.552 --> 22:35.555
No one talks to anyone else.

22:35.622 --> 22:40.259
There's just, like,
this giant chasm

22:40.326 --> 22:41.828
of some kind of grief,

22:41.894 --> 22:46.566
and I have just been thinking
a lot about it these days.

22:47.734 --> 22:55.575
So maybe there is
something there.

23:01.113 --> 23:04.984
I want to know about you
and when you came out.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.019
How old were you?

23:07.086 --> 23:08.688
33.

23:13.359 --> 23:15.227
How old are you now?

23:15.294 --> 23:16.996
33.

23:18.665 --> 23:19.632
Wow.

23:19.699 --> 23:22.034
It's only been
about a month for me.

23:22.101 --> 23:25.337
Really fucking come out
late in your family.

23:25.472 --> 23:26.973
It's--

23:28.541 --> 23:30.142
definitely something

23:30.209 --> 23:33.279
that's been working
its way...

23:33.345 --> 23:34.614
to the surface.

23:34.681 --> 23:36.148
Did you meet my cats?

23:36.215 --> 23:37.283
[meow]

23:37.349 --> 23:38.685
Yeah, I saw them.

23:38.751 --> 23:39.786
Did you?

23:39.852 --> 23:40.853
Yes.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.988
[meow]

23:42.054 --> 23:43.389
Psst psst psst psst.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.558
[door closes]

23:46.693 --> 23:48.928
She finally fell asleep
in your bed.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.898
She refused
to get in her own.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.100
Well,
then why am I here?
Why am I home?

23:54.166 --> 23:56.503
I mean, I was gone,
like, not even an hour.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.737
What happened?

23:57.804 --> 23:59.338
Because your daughter
made me cry.

23:59.405 --> 24:00.640
- That's what happened.
- Mom, you--

24:00.707 --> 24:02.008
She's a real bully.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.743
You can't cry
when you babysit.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.344
Okay?
You're the adult.

24:05.411 --> 24:06.913
Well, tell that to her.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.081
She really knows
how to push buttons.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.517
Honestly, honey,

24:10.517 --> 24:12.318
I don't need another
person in my life

24:12.384 --> 24:14.053
making me feel
like a complete failure.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.888
Okay, can we just--

24:15.955 --> 24:17.089
can we stop?

24:17.156 --> 24:19.391
because you-- My night
is completely ruined.

24:19.526 --> 24:22.562
Your night?
What about my night?

24:22.629 --> 24:25.532
Why do you even
offer to babysit

24:25.598 --> 24:27.834
when you hate it so much?
[sigh]

24:27.900 --> 24:31.671
Because all my friends
do it for their grandkids.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.306
Okay. All right.

24:34.373 --> 24:36.743
Well, that's a great reason.

24:42.181 --> 24:45.852
I didn't tell you,
but your father left me.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.624
I'm alone again.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.196
[sigh]

25:25.825 --> 25:27.493
Good night, you two.

25:27.594 --> 25:30.262
Maura. Maura. Sit down.
Watch with us.

25:30.329 --> 25:31.397
No.

25:31.463 --> 25:32.665
- Oh, come on.
- Please sit.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.166
Have a seat,
sweetheart. Yeah.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.068
- What are you watching?
- I don't know,

25:36.135 --> 25:37.904
but that guy is going to
get mauled by a bear.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.606
- Sal: Mm-hmm.
- Maura: Are these actors?

25:39.606 --> 25:41.007
Sal: No. These are
actually real people.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.609
They get dropped
into the wilderness

25:42.675 --> 25:44.376
with, like, a box
of crackers or some shit.

25:44.443 --> 25:46.412
[chuckling]

25:46.478 --> 25:48.080
Mm-mm.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.316
[giggling]

25:50.382 --> 25:51.918
I've missed this smell.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.886
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hmm?

25:53.953 --> 25:56.155
Did you always date
trans women?

25:56.222 --> 25:57.624
Yeah, I did.

25:57.624 --> 25:58.858
When I was younger,

25:58.925 --> 26:00.359
I realized that I
was trans-amorous.

26:00.426 --> 26:03.229
I kind of explored it
in secrecy, you know--

26:03.295 --> 26:04.731
spank rags and--

26:04.797 --> 26:07.366
and picking up girls
on Santa Monica.

26:07.433 --> 26:08.935
Then one day I realized

26:09.001 --> 26:11.037
I didn't have to separate
love and sex.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.439
I'm glad that I can be
honest now about who I am.

26:13.505 --> 26:14.473
You're great.

26:14.540 --> 26:15.775
Have you two-- Have you--

26:15.842 --> 26:18.344
Has Davina met your family?

26:18.410 --> 26:21.447
Oh. No. You know,
my family's all back east.

26:21.513 --> 26:22.514
Mm.

26:22.649 --> 26:24.250
You like women?

26:24.316 --> 26:25.752
Oh, yes. I love women.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.754
- Huh.
- I've always loved women,

26:27.820 --> 26:28.955
uh, my whole life.

26:29.021 --> 26:31.958
I love every part of them
from head to--

26:33.059 --> 26:34.260
vagina.

26:34.326 --> 26:36.228
I love vaginas.

26:38.665 --> 26:40.399
There's no shame in that.

26:40.466 --> 26:43.535
No.

26:43.670 --> 26:47.406
* I just kept hoping *

26:47.473 --> 26:50.209
* I just kept hoping *

26:50.276 --> 26:53.713
*The way would become clear *

26:53.780 --> 26:55.948
[purring]

26:57.684 --> 26:58.718
[meow]

26:58.785 --> 27:01.721
* I spent all this time *

27:01.788 --> 27:03.222
* Trying to... *

27:03.289 --> 27:04.824
Ahh.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.326
I'm going to bed.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.328
Oh.

27:09.395 --> 27:10.396
Really?

27:10.462 --> 27:11.430
Mm-hmm.

27:11.497 --> 27:12.564
[purring]

27:12.699 --> 27:13.800
I'm sorry. I'm wide awake.

27:13.866 --> 27:17.469
Yeah, well, just grab a book.

27:17.536 --> 27:19.305
Have a nice read.

27:20.773 --> 27:21.974
And if you get cold,

27:22.041 --> 27:23.876
there are more blankets
down the hall.

27:23.943 --> 27:24.811
[meow]

27:24.877 --> 27:27.714
I bet those cats
will keep you warm.

27:27.780 --> 27:30.016
* I spent all this time *

27:30.082 --> 27:31.718
[grunt]

27:31.718 --> 27:34.120
* Trying to figure out why *

27:34.186 --> 27:34.954
Good night.

27:35.021 --> 27:38.457
* Nobody on my side *

27:38.524 --> 27:40.727
[Sal, Davina chatter]

27:44.797 --> 27:46.598
Davina:
I missed you.

27:46.733 --> 27:47.900
- I missed your eyes.
- Really?

27:47.967 --> 27:49.501
- I missed your face.
- Yeah?

27:49.568 --> 27:50.870
I missed your ears.

27:50.937 --> 27:54.606
*So please
don't take this *

27:54.741 --> 27:57.376
*Feeling *

27:57.443 --> 27:58.477
[thump]

27:58.544 --> 28:01.080
Fucking shit.
I'm sorry, babe.

28:05.852 --> 28:13.025
*Please don't
take my feeling *

28:13.092 --> 28:19.799
*I have found at last *

28:19.866 --> 28:22.835
* Hey, if I wanted to *

28:22.902 --> 28:25.772
*I'd be *

28:25.772 --> 28:31.143
* All right *

28:34.680 --> 28:37.616
*Now if I wanted to *

28:37.683 --> 28:40.352
*I'd be *

28:40.419 --> 28:46.158
* All right *

28:50.930 --> 28:52.664
* Mm *

28:52.799 --> 28:53.966
[fingers snapping in rhythm]
