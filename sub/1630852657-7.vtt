00:10.750 --> 00:12.458
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:12.541 --> 00:13.375
My brother,

00:14.791 --> 00:16.958
all he wanted was a peaceful life.

00:19.916 --> 00:21.708
His smile was just like yours.

00:26.375 --> 00:27.208
Beautiful.

00:28.208 --> 00:30.916
Wow! You're wearing a dress shirt here.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.583
It doesn't look like you.

00:34.416 --> 00:36.916
-I was very different.
-You really were.

00:39.541 --> 00:41.625
I miss you, brother.

00:43.916 --> 00:44.750
Hey.

00:45.250 --> 00:47.875
-Let's take a picture.
-I don't want to.

00:47.958 --> 00:50.666
-Why not?
-Mom already took a lot of pictures.

00:53.166 --> 00:55.000
Danilo, fix your hair.

00:55.083 --> 00:56.333
Do it while you can,

00:56.416 --> 01:00.000
next year you'll be a freshman,
and I'll shave your head.

01:03.041 --> 01:05.250
Don't worry. I'll always be here.

01:08.791 --> 01:10.000
Smile!

01:10.833 --> 01:13.125
My sons are so handsome!

01:51.208 --> 01:52.625
Did I disappoint you?

01:54.208 --> 01:55.208
No.

01:57.583 --> 01:58.833
I'm not disappointed.

02:00.791 --> 02:04.208
But for a guy who used to talk
about simple things in life,

02:04.708 --> 02:06.833
I thought he'd have another story.

02:09.416 --> 02:11.791
Catarina, my family is wealthy,

02:11.875 --> 02:13.833
but I'm not like Rodrigo.

02:14.833 --> 02:16.166
You know that, right?

02:23.416 --> 02:24.375
Do you trust me?

02:25.666 --> 02:27.041
Because I trust you.

03:11.541 --> 03:15.666
<i>Collapsing from tiring flights</i>

03:17.208 --> 03:18.125
<i>Compli--</i>

03:19.625 --> 03:21.541
How long have you been there?

03:22.666 --> 03:26.208
-It's nice watching you play.
-I found it in the bedroom.

03:26.291 --> 03:27.416
-Cool, huh?
-Yes.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.750
A surfer from Maui gave it to me.

03:30.375 --> 03:32.541
-Wow!
-This ukulele. Yeah.

03:33.958 --> 03:36.083
-Can you play?
-Yes.

03:36.833 --> 03:38.791
Do you know this one? <i>Collapsing--</i>

03:38.875 --> 03:40.750
-This tone, right?
-Listen.

03:41.291 --> 03:44.625
<i>Collapsing from tiring flights</i>

03:44.708 --> 03:47.500
<i>Complicated and thoughtful</i>

03:47.583 --> 03:50.916
<i>Hurt after so many hardships</i>

03:51.000 --> 03:53.541
<i>Armored by our own reasons</i>

03:53.625 --> 03:56.375
<i>-Buenos días.</i>
<i>-Buenos días.</i>

03:56.458 --> 03:59.791
<i>I'll wait for it</i>
<i>Maybe in the Spring</i>

03:59.875 --> 04:02.333
<i>The sky is clear and it's warm</i>

04:02.416 --> 04:05.708
<i>See what's left of us</i>
<i>What it once was</i>

04:05.791 --> 04:07.375
<i>The world turns in collapse</i>

04:07.458 --> 04:11.375
<i>So many lies increase the rage</i>
<i>Of those who suffer in silence</i>

04:11.875 --> 04:14.791
<i>The page turns, the sound goes wild</i>
<i>We get crazy</i>

04:14.875 --> 04:17.541
<i>And in the middle of all of it</i> <i>all</i>

04:17.625 --> 04:20.250
<i>We're like birds</i>

04:20.333 --> 04:26.333
<i>Free to fly the way we want to</i>
<i>To find a nest</i>

04:26.416 --> 04:29.875
<i>Even if it's on each other's heart</i>

04:29.958 --> 04:32.291
<i>We're like birds</i>

04:32.375 --> 04:35.000
<i>Free to fly the way we want to</i>

04:35.083 --> 04:35.916
Yasmin…

04:36.000 --> 04:38.375
<i>To find a nest</i>

04:38.458 --> 04:41.875
<i>Even if it's on each other's heart</i>

04:48.208 --> 04:49.666
You scared me!

04:58.458 --> 04:59.583
Wait, Maresia.

05:00.291 --> 05:03.833
You need to vary your sources of carbs.

05:04.916 --> 05:07.750
I'm eating pancakes,
whipped cream, chocolate…

05:07.833 --> 05:10.958
-It seems varied to me.
-Hey! Did you tell her?

05:11.041 --> 05:12.166
Tell me what?

05:14.250 --> 05:17.125
What are you up to?
Are you trying to kill me?

05:17.791 --> 05:20.291
You know the scout
that's coming to see Rodrigo?

05:20.375 --> 05:21.541
I talked to him,

05:22.041 --> 05:24.791
and, if you want,
he'll see you surfing too.

05:24.875 --> 05:26.250
-Really?
-Today.

05:26.333 --> 05:28.958
At 3:00 p.m. We have time
to train this morning.

05:29.041 --> 05:31.541
But I just started surfing!

05:31.625 --> 05:34.416
-These sponsors--
-They want young people.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.583
-To invest from the beginning.
-It's not about experience.

05:37.666 --> 05:38.916
It's about potential.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.833
And I think you have a lot of potential.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.375
Only if you want it.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.916
I do. I really want that.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.791
Yay! So, let's get to training, Big Rider!
Hang loose!

05:53.541 --> 05:55.708
Listen. Let me eat this.

06:04.041 --> 06:05.666
-Good morning.
-Morning!

06:06.250 --> 06:07.958
Can I talk to your manager?

06:08.541 --> 06:11.375
Something unpleasant happened to my card.

06:12.083 --> 06:13.416
I'm the manager.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.291
Well, great.

06:16.375 --> 06:19.375
So, here's what happened.
I forgot my wallet here.

06:19.458 --> 06:21.041
I checked my credit card,

06:21.125 --> 06:24.708
and saw a purchase I didn't make
in an expensive jewelry store.

06:25.291 --> 06:27.625
I'm sorry. What's your name?

06:28.333 --> 06:31.083
-Paula.
-Paula. All right, Mrs. Paula.

06:31.166 --> 06:33.916
That's unlikely.
My staff is very trustworthy.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.458
Everyone here plays by the rules.
I make sure of that.

06:37.541 --> 06:40.833
I've been here for days, honey.
It must've been here.

06:40.916 --> 06:44.541
I understand. Have you heard
about digital frauds?

06:44.625 --> 06:48.250
Sometimes we use
our credit cards on websites…

06:48.333 --> 06:51.833
I didn't know managers
could be employees of the month.

06:51.916 --> 06:53.458
Isn't it cute?

06:54.083 --> 06:58.583
Because I got so many of those,
I was promoted to manager.

06:58.666 --> 07:00.541
And I'll be glad to help you.

07:00.625 --> 07:04.041
I'm gonna give you my personal number.

07:04.125 --> 07:07.166
You can call me right away if you need.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.375
Catarina. Here.

07:11.500 --> 07:12.833
I like you.

07:14.041 --> 07:15.958
You're nothing like the others.

07:16.541 --> 07:17.791
Others?

07:18.583 --> 07:21.291
Between us, you're great.

07:21.791 --> 07:24.333
But a special hotel like this

07:24.416 --> 07:27.291
should have more appropriate employees.

07:28.708 --> 07:30.416
-Thank you.
-Bye.

07:35.250 --> 07:38.708
It's me! Now you'll have my number too.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.875
-Noted. Bye!
-See you.

07:46.208 --> 07:48.500
Put your hands on your chest.

07:49.916 --> 07:53.750
It's through your heart
that spirituality can manifest.

07:56.250 --> 07:58.916
Absorb all knowledge

07:59.791 --> 08:00.875
that you can.

08:05.208 --> 08:09.208
Don't let external noises
get your attention.

08:09.291 --> 08:10.166
Hey.

08:12.333 --> 08:13.666
Close your eyes.

08:13.750 --> 08:17.958
Close your eyes,
and focus only on your breathing.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.166
Focus on your body.

08:22.250 --> 08:26.083
And keep this meditative state
for a couple of minutes.

08:30.208 --> 08:31.958
-Marília…
-Why here, Caco?

08:32.041 --> 08:34.083
I mean, inner peace, right?

08:35.166 --> 08:37.375
Relax. Do you think I wanted to come here?

08:37.458 --> 08:39.416
What's going on? You disappeared.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.416
You know about my situation.

08:42.916 --> 08:45.458
Miguel won't sell, and nobody is selling.

08:45.541 --> 08:46.666
Forget it!

08:47.250 --> 08:50.208
Forget it. No one will show up
at the end of the season.

08:51.333 --> 08:55.125
Enjoy while the hotel is full
of rich kids wanting to buy weed.

08:58.375 --> 08:59.916
Focus on your breathing.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.125
Concentrate.

09:04.791 --> 09:06.375
I'm working now. Please--

09:06.458 --> 09:08.958
Listen. I know you need the money.

09:10.166 --> 09:12.125
So many bills to pay…

09:13.833 --> 09:15.875
Where's the radio? Can I see it?

09:18.416 --> 09:20.291
Here it is! Check it out!

09:20.916 --> 09:22.125
How do I turn it on?

09:23.583 --> 09:25.125
-Pressing this bu--
-Come.

09:25.833 --> 09:26.666
Stay there.

09:36.166 --> 09:37.208
Breathe.

09:39.208 --> 09:42.041
Bring your attention
to the present moment.

09:46.916 --> 09:48.916
Now open your eyes slowly.

09:52.208 --> 09:53.333
<i>Yay!</i>

09:55.208 --> 09:59.208
-That wipeout was terrible!
-It's part of the game.

09:59.291 --> 10:02.333
Keep doing what you did during training…

10:05.416 --> 10:06.625
Guest on table five.

10:07.250 --> 10:08.500
Just a sec.

10:09.708 --> 10:12.375
Helena, get away from your phone!

10:12.458 --> 10:14.166
Take a break from the screen.

10:14.916 --> 10:16.041
Look who's talking!

10:16.833 --> 10:20.541
This is a budget app.
It's not entertainment.

10:26.708 --> 10:27.750
-Helena.
-Hey!

10:27.833 --> 10:30.125
Don't! What will the algorithm think?

10:30.208 --> 10:33.291
Worried about
what the algorithm will think?

10:33.375 --> 10:36.000
What kind of TV shows it'll suggest now?

10:36.083 --> 10:39.375
It can even cancel
the TV show I'm watching now.

10:39.458 --> 10:42.375
I'll be canceled
if I don't lower my expenses.

10:43.458 --> 10:44.791
Hey. Anyone?

10:44.875 --> 10:46.708
We'll both be canceled.

10:48.041 --> 10:48.875
What is it?

10:50.250 --> 10:51.250
What's up?

10:51.916 --> 10:54.416
After everything I've done
to get this body,

10:54.500 --> 10:56.541
and finally have some self-esteem,

10:56.625 --> 10:59.583
Léo Pororoca shows up again,
and he can't finish?

10:59.666 --> 11:02.208
Know what it feels like? Double bullying.

11:04.041 --> 11:06.875
That's wrong in so many levels, Helena.

11:06.958 --> 11:09.666
-I don't even know where to start.
-Hey!

11:10.166 --> 11:11.125
We're coming!

11:13.125 --> 11:16.000
Look, I canceled my health insurance,

11:16.083 --> 11:18.083
now it's Sofia's painting classes.

11:19.833 --> 11:22.625
And the yoga studio… Goodbye.

11:34.125 --> 11:38.041
You're planning your future,
and I haven't figured out my past yet.

11:43.916 --> 11:45.000
I'm coming.

11:55.416 --> 11:57.125
What a surprise!

11:57.791 --> 11:59.583
My dad went to the hotel,

11:59.666 --> 12:02.833
and I escaped training
to see you, you know?

12:02.916 --> 12:06.166
I know it's hard to stay away
from this hottie, right?

12:06.250 --> 12:07.625
-Very hard.
-It's true.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.041
Actually, I was thinking.

12:12.125 --> 12:14.750
The scout will be surprised
when he sees you.

12:15.708 --> 12:18.458
What about the arrangements
for the big day?

12:19.916 --> 12:21.583
Come here, let me show you!

12:24.416 --> 12:26.916
Freedom in a bottle of cannabidiol.

12:27.791 --> 12:30.625
-We just have to see if it works.
-It'll work.

12:31.375 --> 12:34.208
-No more expensive meds.
-No more expensive meds.

12:43.541 --> 12:44.375
Rodrigo!

12:56.208 --> 12:57.666
Son of a bitch.

13:07.750 --> 13:10.791
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK

13:26.458 --> 13:30.333
DO NOT DISTURB

13:39.083 --> 13:42.500
FRAGILE

13:56.750 --> 13:57.750
Hey, coach.

14:00.208 --> 14:01.541
I let you down.

14:03.250 --> 14:04.333
I'm sorry.

14:05.416 --> 14:07.416
-Prune that one.
-That one, right?

14:07.500 --> 14:11.458
-And check if there's aphid.
<i>-But listen. I kept on training.</i>

14:12.291 --> 14:14.625
<i>And I'll be at the beach at 2:00 p.m.</i>

14:15.541 --> 14:18.333
<i>It'd mean a lot to me</i>
<i>if you could be there too.</i>

14:19.125 --> 14:21.250
<i>Can you give me one more chance?</i>

14:22.375 --> 14:23.500
Rodrigo, right?

14:24.750 --> 14:26.416
It seems he hasn't given up.

14:27.375 --> 14:29.291
With Rodrigo, you never know.

14:30.208 --> 14:32.208
-Give him a chance.
-Another one?

14:33.625 --> 14:36.333
I know you worry about him. You like him.

14:36.416 --> 14:37.583
Exactly.

14:37.666 --> 14:41.083
Someone must show him
the world doesn't revolve around him.

14:42.666 --> 14:46.833
I agree, baby, but this is his chance
to find a new path.

14:47.833 --> 14:49.500
And he needs a paragon.

14:50.166 --> 14:51.250
He needs you.

15:06.916 --> 15:08.291
Nice chair.

15:09.625 --> 15:12.041
Very comfortable. Look at this.

15:12.541 --> 15:14.416
I didn't remember this.

15:15.875 --> 15:18.666
But on clause 14, 5th paragraph,

15:18.750 --> 15:21.250
it says you can be removed from management

15:21.750 --> 15:25.875
in case the investor's financial assets
are at risk.

15:26.875 --> 15:31.541
Elias, this hotel is our home.
We'd never put it at risk.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.458
That's not what it looks like.

15:34.541 --> 15:38.583
People have published
derogatory pictures of the hotel.

15:39.083 --> 15:39.916
Right?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.083
There was drug trafficking here.

15:42.166 --> 15:45.041
Anyway, all sorts of mismanagement.

15:45.916 --> 15:47.208
And now this.

15:48.875 --> 15:51.750
An attack against my private property

15:52.500 --> 15:53.625
by your employees.

15:53.708 --> 15:54.833
What is that about?

15:56.791 --> 15:57.625
This.

16:05.041 --> 16:06.541
According to my lawyers,

16:06.625 --> 16:10.541
this is vandalism
against the investor's asset.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.833
Well, I think the hotel management
needs some changes.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.083
Hey, Jorge.

16:29.166 --> 16:31.416
Remember when I did you a favor?

16:31.916 --> 16:34.875
It's time you return it. Okay?

16:36.875 --> 16:38.375
I need you to do something.

16:38.875 --> 16:40.083
Hi, Hassef. It's me.

16:40.166 --> 16:43.666
There's been a setback.
I need you to call me asap.

16:46.291 --> 16:49.791
Yes, Catarina.
From the Maresia Hotel. Exactly.

16:49.875 --> 16:54.083
I made a request
about the reports of our computer.

16:54.583 --> 16:55.916
It's William, right?

16:56.500 --> 17:00.833
Can you tell me when
you'll be able to get back to me?

17:00.916 --> 17:02.791
Our client is very impatient.

17:03.541 --> 17:04.375
Yeah.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.625
Okay, great.

17:06.708 --> 17:08.208
Thank you. Bye.

17:08.791 --> 17:10.791
Paula, right on time. You're lucky.

17:10.875 --> 17:13.375
-Great.
-I've talked to IT.

17:13.458 --> 17:16.250
They'll get back to us in 48 hours.

17:16.333 --> 17:17.375
Mystery solved.

17:17.458 --> 17:20.208
That's great, honey.
All I want is to be wrong.

17:20.291 --> 17:22.125
I know, right?

17:22.208 --> 17:25.375
-I hate being suspicious.
-Yeah.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.875
-Thanks, Cat!
-No problem.

17:28.958 --> 17:31.458
I'm glad this hotel
has a manager like you.

17:32.041 --> 17:32.875
Bye.

17:35.666 --> 17:37.583
Oh, I'm so fucked.

17:44.166 --> 17:47.583
Lock the door, Dad!

18:29.666 --> 18:30.500
Chai?

18:37.500 --> 18:38.750
The price is R$ 30.

18:38.833 --> 18:42.291
But today's your lucky day.
It'll be five for R$ 100.

18:42.791 --> 18:44.333
I don't think so. Thanks.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.375
It's good stuff.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.416
It's on sale.

18:48.708 --> 18:49.541
I want it.

18:55.541 --> 18:56.500
One or five?

18:58.083 --> 18:58.916
Just one.

18:59.958 --> 19:01.250
And one beer, please.

19:16.708 --> 19:20.916
Girl, I was talking to the guest,
and it just came to me.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.958
Beer, table five, okay?

19:23.750 --> 19:26.541
-Pastry, table two.
-I want an honest relationship.

19:26.625 --> 19:29.000
Like Elle and Noah,
from <i>The Kissing Booth.</i>

19:29.083 --> 19:32.291
Sure. This one is for table five too.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.708
Respecting each other's limits--

19:34.791 --> 19:38.250
Helena! Real life is calling.
Let's get to work.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.708
You can think about that later. Come on.

20:02.916 --> 20:03.750
Hey!

20:07.041 --> 20:08.125
Want some?

20:13.041 --> 20:14.583
Some people are crazy.

20:14.666 --> 20:17.666
The guy from table five
didn't touch the pastry!

20:18.166 --> 20:20.791
Did you serve him the beer?
Did he pay you?

20:20.875 --> 20:24.791
Oh, wait. Maybe I'm crazy.
I switched the orders.

20:26.083 --> 20:26.916
Holy shit.

20:29.333 --> 20:30.666
Oh, God.

20:30.750 --> 20:32.875
Come on! Can't you do your job?

20:32.958 --> 20:35.333
Relax, I can switch back.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.833
I can't believe this.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.708
Calm down. I just switched the orders--

20:42.791 --> 20:45.666
You always have your head
in the clouds, Helena.

20:45.750 --> 20:48.541
You pretend your real life
is a series, a movie.

20:48.625 --> 20:49.708
-Okay?
-I'm hungry.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.791
You're forgetting to live, Helena.

20:51.875 --> 20:55.291
-That's what you're doing. Okay.
-I need to poop.

20:55.375 --> 20:57.875
This is real life, Helena. Okay?

20:57.958 --> 20:59.375
Okay. She can take this.

20:59.458 --> 21:01.500
Take it, honey. Thank you.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.916
Okay, it's safer here.

21:23.625 --> 21:25.208
I missed you so much.

21:26.541 --> 21:28.583
Chai, we need to talk.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.291
What? Didn't you like the surprise?

21:33.125 --> 21:35.083
No! This is not what I mean.

21:35.583 --> 21:36.416
I just--

21:37.500 --> 21:39.208
I wasn't expecting this, and…

21:41.958 --> 21:44.291
I just can't believe you're here.

21:44.875 --> 21:46.708
Are you okay?

21:47.750 --> 21:51.375
Things are crazy.
But I have a plan. Are you ready?

21:52.541 --> 21:53.375
What plan?

21:54.291 --> 21:56.125
You and I,

21:57.041 --> 22:00.875
we can live together in Rio,
I have a crib next to your college.

22:01.875 --> 22:05.333
By the way,
everybody's talking about it at the hood.

22:05.875 --> 22:09.125
You always said you wouldn't make it.

22:09.208 --> 22:11.083
But you did in the first try.

22:11.666 --> 22:12.583
I told you.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.000
You did.

22:16.083 --> 22:18.541
I think it's our chance to start over.

22:19.041 --> 22:20.250
Away from everyone.

22:21.583 --> 22:23.166
I just need a place

22:23.250 --> 22:26.333
to hide for a few days
until they come to pick us up.

22:29.541 --> 22:33.416
Chai, I can't just leave here,
you know? I--

22:35.125 --> 22:37.458
-Hey, Yasmin.
-Dad?

22:39.500 --> 22:40.583
This is Chai.

22:40.666 --> 22:42.458
-Hey.
-What's up?

22:42.541 --> 22:43.375
He's…

22:44.791 --> 22:46.041
he's from São Paulo.

22:47.625 --> 22:48.958
Can you come outside?

22:50.125 --> 22:51.041
Sure.

22:56.625 --> 23:00.916
Can Chai stay for a day or two? I just…

23:03.375 --> 23:05.583
He's on the run, but it's not his fault.

23:05.666 --> 23:08.500
Is that a joke? You're kidding me, right?

23:08.583 --> 23:12.833
All we need right now
is a wanted guy here in the hotel.

23:13.875 --> 23:17.041
What you did at Elias's pool
was nothing, right?

23:18.041 --> 23:21.416
Vilma's trying to solve it,
but we're hanging by a thread.

23:23.875 --> 23:25.041
I'm sorry.

23:25.125 --> 23:27.208
I have nothing against your friend.

23:27.791 --> 23:30.750
But Elias has enough reasons
to bring us down.

23:30.833 --> 23:32.458
We can lose the hotel

23:32.541 --> 23:35.375
because of your childish behavior.
And this is our home.

23:36.958 --> 23:39.125
It can be yours too, if you want.

23:41.791 --> 23:45.500
I don't know what you think,
but I'm going to the beach.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.583
Do you want to surf?

23:47.666 --> 23:50.000
You have to decide
what to do with your life.

23:54.791 --> 23:56.416
Is there coconut water in Chile?

23:56.916 --> 24:00.583
Yes. Not this sweet, but yes.

24:01.416 --> 24:02.541
Beaches too, right?

24:03.500 --> 24:05.583
Of course, many of them.

24:07.916 --> 24:11.708
Have you ever thought
about being a lifeguard there?

24:13.125 --> 24:15.166
I don't know. Maybe.

24:16.250 --> 24:17.083
Why?

24:18.333 --> 24:19.958
You're acting weird.

24:20.875 --> 24:22.125
I'm not acting weird.

24:22.833 --> 24:24.458
I'm just thinking.

24:25.625 --> 24:26.750
-Thinking?
-Yes.

24:27.250 --> 24:28.583
What are you thinking?

24:29.083 --> 24:32.791
I'm thinking about us,
about what's happening.

24:33.916 --> 24:36.500
-What's happening?
-I like this.

24:37.083 --> 24:38.375
-Really?
-Really.

24:40.416 --> 24:42.833
Me too. A little bit.

24:43.875 --> 24:44.958
A little bit?

24:45.875 --> 24:47.750
Nah. A lot.

24:57.916 --> 24:58.750
What is it?

25:00.666 --> 25:02.166
Can I tell you something?

25:02.708 --> 25:03.541
Sure.

25:05.166 --> 25:06.916
Remember when we met?

25:07.000 --> 25:08.916
When you got me out of the pool.

25:10.208 --> 25:11.375
That day,

25:12.375 --> 25:15.500
I think I started
seeing things differently.

25:16.416 --> 25:17.625
And you were right.

25:18.583 --> 25:21.375
<i>No voy más a dejar la vida</i>
<i>me llevar adelante.</i>

25:22.000 --> 25:23.375
I want to lead my life.

25:24.666 --> 25:26.750
But I wanna do this away from here.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.958
No…

25:44.791 --> 25:45.958
No…

25:46.625 --> 25:47.750
Oh God, no!

25:53.875 --> 25:54.708
<i>Chai!</i>

25:55.208 --> 25:59.708
Wait! So you think I've changed?
Why, dude?

26:00.458 --> 26:05.125
I came here thinking I'd find that girl
with scraped knees, you know?

26:05.708 --> 26:09.166
But you couldn't even introduce me
as your boyfriend to your dad.

26:09.250 --> 26:12.666
So what? I'm the same person I was,

26:12.750 --> 26:15.041
who fights against the system.

26:15.125 --> 26:18.333
You know? Who loves skating. You know me!

26:20.958 --> 26:22.208
I'll always be thankful

26:23.333 --> 26:24.375
for what you did.

26:25.625 --> 26:29.375
For protecting me and taking the blame
for that broken window.

26:36.833 --> 26:39.041
<i>I sing to remember our story</i>

26:39.750 --> 26:42.500
<i>In the middle of chaos, we'll find glory</i>

26:43.125 --> 26:45.791
<i>After so many struggles</i>
<i>We'll get to victory</i>

26:47.416 --> 26:51.125
<i>I have my roots</i>
<i>My ground to be happy</i>

26:51.208 --> 26:53.333
<i>I invade, I don't fit in</i>

26:54.166 --> 26:56.416
<i>I invade, I don't fit in</i>

26:56.916 --> 26:57.750
Remember?

27:03.125 --> 27:04.125
Oh no.

27:29.291 --> 27:31.833
It's time you let go
of this anchor, Yasmin.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.708
No more holding on to the past.

27:39.666 --> 27:40.875
Open your eyes.

27:41.625 --> 27:43.875
You may think you belong here,

27:44.375 --> 27:47.791
but this place doesn't want you to stay.
You know?

28:10.375 --> 28:12.458
BOAT TAXI

28:35.166 --> 28:37.875
Why do you want to leave now?

28:38.375 --> 28:39.875
I'm sorry for saying this now.

28:41.916 --> 28:45.458
It's your first day as a lifeguard.
I'm really happy for you.

28:47.916 --> 28:49.708
But I needed to let it out.

28:52.708 --> 28:54.791
You can trust me, you know?

28:58.125 --> 28:59.833
I'm in love with you.

28:59.916 --> 29:01.125
Me too.

29:02.000 --> 29:02.833
But

29:03.833 --> 29:04.666
look at this.

29:07.916 --> 29:09.166
I'm happy here.

29:10.750 --> 29:14.208
I can't run away with you now.

29:14.291 --> 29:15.791
I know, Diego.

29:17.583 --> 29:20.958
But the freedom you feel
when you look at this place,

29:21.750 --> 29:24.041
that's what I want. You know?

29:25.416 --> 29:28.666
I want to start my life from scratch,
and I wanna do it with you.

29:29.291 --> 29:31.708
I don't wanna think about my past anymore.

29:39.666 --> 29:41.083
The last thing

29:41.875 --> 29:43.083
I need right now

29:44.458 --> 29:46.000
is to talk about the past.

29:58.708 --> 29:59.666
Hey, Maresia.

30:00.500 --> 30:03.000
Where's the champion you told me about?

30:03.083 --> 30:06.916
Rodrigo's got some issues,
but he'll be here.

30:07.000 --> 30:07.833
Right.

30:08.333 --> 30:11.041
And the new girl I told you,
she's amazing.

30:11.625 --> 30:13.791
-I'm sure you'll love her.
-Really?

30:14.666 --> 30:16.625
-Let's see.
-She's here.

30:17.666 --> 30:18.583
Hey, Yasmin.

30:20.208 --> 30:21.291
Good luck.

30:57.916 --> 30:59.625
-The tide is coming.
-Is it?

31:00.125 --> 31:02.125
There she goes.

31:12.583 --> 31:13.833
-Damn it.
-Fuck.

31:56.250 --> 31:59.166
-Look. There she goes.
-Let's see.

32:00.583 --> 32:01.500
She can do it.

32:11.416 --> 32:12.958
Awesome!

32:19.791 --> 32:21.958
Did you get this?

32:32.166 --> 32:34.333
-Unbelievable.
-She has style.

32:45.416 --> 32:47.791
That was awesome.

32:48.791 --> 32:51.083
-So?
-Good job, Yasmin.

32:51.166 --> 32:52.791
I can see you're dedicated.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.875
Listen, you have a rough diamond here.

32:55.958 --> 32:57.250
Yay!

32:59.875 --> 33:03.458
Well, I'll get in touch
with the brand's owner

33:03.541 --> 33:04.750
and get back to you.

33:04.833 --> 33:06.875
-Great. Thank you so much.
-Yeah.

33:09.083 --> 33:10.083
What's up?

33:11.791 --> 33:15.125
Sorry, I'm late, but I'm ready now.

33:15.208 --> 33:17.416
Turn on the camera, let's roll.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.833
Put the camera away,
I've seen enough for today.

33:22.916 --> 33:24.125
This guy isn't worth it.

33:26.875 --> 33:29.458
Are you okay, Rodrigo? Go home.

33:32.208 --> 33:34.125
I don't even know if I have a home.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.083
She's really good.

33:42.833 --> 33:44.500
-He's drunk.
-Yes.

34:06.000 --> 34:06.833
Hi, Helena.

34:06.916 --> 34:09.625
Do you know what the problem is?

34:10.125 --> 34:13.958
Tell me, because I keep thinking
about that night and I still don't…

34:14.458 --> 34:16.625
It's here, inside my head.

34:16.708 --> 34:19.541
After that, I pictured
five seasons of our story.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.291
You and I,
visiting every beach in the world.

34:22.875 --> 34:25.166
I wasn't ready for real life.

34:25.750 --> 34:28.208
And now, life goes on. Excuse me.

34:28.291 --> 34:31.708
Wait a sec. You always make a speech.

34:31.791 --> 34:34.625
Can you listen to me just once?

34:35.916 --> 34:37.208
I'm sorry.

34:38.125 --> 34:41.250
This has never happened
to me before. I don't know.

34:41.333 --> 34:44.500
It's weird, I got nervous, and…

34:44.583 --> 34:47.583
-There's only one explanation.
-Yeah? What is it?

34:48.916 --> 34:50.083
It's crazy, but I…

34:51.541 --> 34:53.666
I think I'm still in love with you.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.333
What?

34:58.458 --> 35:01.083
You used to call me "Free Willy"!

35:01.166 --> 35:03.416
I was just going with the flow.

35:03.500 --> 35:06.375
I was a jerk, Helena.

35:07.333 --> 35:09.291
I always thought you were pretty.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.083
Since I was a kid.

35:11.833 --> 35:12.708
Then prove it.

35:32.208 --> 35:33.791
In two days,

35:34.541 --> 35:37.791
I'm going to Hawaii
for a surf competition.

35:38.916 --> 35:39.750
Come with me.

35:41.958 --> 35:44.208
Don't you like happy endings?

36:12.833 --> 36:16.041
The flyers about the tour.
In case Maresia asks.

36:16.125 --> 36:17.708
Diego, wait.

36:18.458 --> 36:20.875
-Let me explain--
-It's okay.

36:20.958 --> 36:24.166
-I didn't choose the right words.
-Guys, excuse me.

36:24.250 --> 36:26.166
I need to talk to you, Catarina.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.166
What happened? What is it?

36:28.250 --> 36:31.458
I know we can't talk about Rodrigo,

36:31.541 --> 36:33.375
but I'd talk to him if I were you.

36:38.625 --> 36:40.541
What the hell did he do now?

36:40.625 --> 36:43.291
He showed up drunk and didn't even surf.

36:44.333 --> 36:46.208
He's still alone at the beach.

36:47.041 --> 36:50.250
I'm afraid he'll do something stupid.

37:18.500 --> 37:21.791
I'll sell it for R$ 400.
It's Colombian, good stuff.

37:22.458 --> 37:24.375
Yeah, but money is tight.

37:25.041 --> 37:26.000
Thanks.

37:30.208 --> 37:31.750
Hey, girl!

37:32.458 --> 37:34.750
If I drop it to 300, will you take it?

37:34.833 --> 37:38.250
Please, it's good stuff.
I swear, it'll get you high.

37:38.916 --> 37:40.416
-Is it really good?
-Yeah.

37:41.250 --> 37:43.291
-Okay. R$ 300, then.
-All right.

37:44.958 --> 37:46.875
Sofia. What is it?

37:48.333 --> 37:50.458
What is it, honey?

37:54.666 --> 37:55.750
It's shrimp!

39:06.916 --> 39:08.250
Rodrigo!

39:09.375 --> 39:10.458
-Come back!
-Hey!

39:11.000 --> 39:12.625
Come back!

39:15.958 --> 39:17.375
Rodrigo!

39:18.000 --> 39:18.833
<i>Breathe…</i>

39:18.916 --> 39:19.833
Guys!

39:20.583 --> 39:24.708
Guys! Vitor, call a boat,
we need to rush to the hospital!

39:24.791 --> 39:27.000
-Okay.
-Breathe, sweetie.

39:31.875 --> 39:33.000
Rodrigo!

39:35.625 --> 39:36.541
He'll drown!

39:38.208 --> 39:39.333
<i>Mírame, hermano.</i>

39:39.416 --> 39:40.250
He's drowning!

39:40.333 --> 39:42.541
<i>No, we're too drunk.</i>

39:42.625 --> 39:44.375
<i>-I'm not drunk.</i>
-Rodrigo!

39:44.458 --> 39:47.625
<i>-Look! I'll show you.</i>
<i>-Don't go in the water now.</i>

39:47.708 --> 39:51.416
<i>-I'm floating.</i>
<i>-Wait, Danilo. Hey!</i>

39:53.375 --> 39:54.416
<i>Danilo!</i>

39:54.916 --> 39:55.916
Listen.

39:56.500 --> 39:57.583
You can do it.

39:58.083 --> 39:59.875
You can do it. I'm right here.

40:00.458 --> 40:01.541
I'm with you.

40:02.458 --> 40:03.625
I'm with you.

40:18.041 --> 40:18.875
Oh, God.

40:21.958 --> 40:23.541
Rodrigo!

40:24.916 --> 40:26.458
Come back.

40:58.833 --> 41:02.041
<i>-Danilo! Hey, Danilo!</i>
<i>-Diego.</i>

41:02.125 --> 41:03.833
<i>Help me, brother.</i>

41:03.916 --> 41:05.500
<i>-Danilo!</i>
<i>-Help me!</i>

41:06.583 --> 41:09.375
<i>I have to save him! No!</i>

41:10.333 --> 41:11.708
<i>I can't breathe!</i>

41:14.666 --> 41:15.500
<i>Danilo!</i>

41:19.458 --> 41:20.291
Where's Diego?

41:22.250 --> 41:23.125
Where's Diego?

41:24.041 --> 41:24.875
Diego…

41:25.416 --> 41:27.833
Diego!

41:29.208 --> 41:31.208
Oh my God! Diego!
