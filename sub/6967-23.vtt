00:45.245 --> 00:47.304
Here. Let me do it.

00:48.815 --> 00:50.510
Put your number in, then your card.

00:51.418 --> 00:52.680
What's your number, Roland?

00:54.287 --> 00:55.879
Three fifteen.

01:02.429 --> 01:03.987
See how easy it is?

01:11.271 --> 01:13.262
- Engine efficiency?
- 94 percent.

01:13.339 --> 01:14.636
We need more!

01:15.408 --> 01:18.309
- How's the back pressure?
- What do you think? Climbing.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.538
Increase the blade inclination.

01:20.647 --> 01:25.311
- I said, increase the blade inclination!
- Inclination is pi over nine!

01:25.418 --> 01:27.545
We've reached maximum velocity.

01:27.654 --> 01:28.951
No!

01:29.055 --> 01:32.047
Let it go. It will work!

01:32.125 --> 01:35.117
The engine'll destroy itself!
I won't do that.

01:35.328 --> 01:39.355
It's not going to destroy itself.
Come on! We're almost there!

01:39.499 --> 01:42.525
- Something's wrong with our equations.
- What happened?

01:42.635 --> 01:46.469
- Nothing. Surnow pulled the plug.
- I'm protecting the baby!

01:46.539 --> 01:50.839
- And four years of work, Frank.
- Work that's going to add up to zilch.

01:50.910 --> 01:55.472
Unless we show some progress,
they're going to pull the plug on us, Ron.

01:58.852 --> 02:04.848
- He's right. You should've continued the test.
- Someone'll crack Mach 15. I want it to be us.

02:05.859 --> 02:10.295
I won'tjeopardize everything because
you two can't wait to see your name in print!

02:10.363 --> 02:12.923
It's the print that gets the money, Ron.

02:13.700 --> 02:17.363
If you want to go down in flames
together, fine. You go ahead.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.529
I'm going to do the math.

02:23.009 --> 02:25.102
Good night, Dr Keats.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.923
What the hell?!

03:18.598 --> 03:21.362
Roland! Open the door!

03:24.938 --> 03:29.671
Open the door! Roland, I want you
to listen to me very carefully.

03:29.776 --> 03:33.075
We have to open this door,
Roland. Stop typing!

03:33.179 --> 03:34.612
Roland!

03:51.864 --> 03:53.593
Roland! Open the door!

03:53.666 --> 03:54.963
What are you doing?!

03:56.302 --> 03:57.599
Open the door!

03:59.372 --> 04:01.966
Roland, are you listening?!

06:01.194 --> 06:04.721
- How was the wedding?
- The part where the groom passed out

06:04.797 --> 06:08.358
- or the dog bit the drummer?
- Did you catch the bouquet?

06:08.434 --> 06:12.564
Maybe. Is that what you couldn't
talk to me about over the phone?

06:12.638 --> 06:15.766
The project they say doesn't exist does exist.

06:15.908 --> 06:19.810
- The Icarus Project?
- The next generation in jet-engine design

06:19.946 --> 06:23.177
capable of doubling speeds
using half the fuel.

06:23.249 --> 06:25.342
At least in theory.

06:25.418 --> 06:28.819
And Ronald Surnow was
an aeronautical scientist

06:28.955 --> 06:31.617
- who worked on it here at the university?
- Yes.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.789
How close are they?

06:33.926 --> 06:38.659
I'm not sure, but Surnow's the second
scientist to die in the last six months.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.824
OK. But how is this an X-File?

06:41.601 --> 06:44.570
You don't think this is
about UFO technology?

06:44.637 --> 06:48.596
There's something unexplainable,
but not unidentifiable.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.840
- Keats?
- There.

06:56.983 --> 06:58.177
Dr Keats?

06:59.652 --> 07:01.142
We're with the FBI.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.188
Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.850
We understand you discovered Dr Surnow.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.983
What was left of him.

07:10.997 --> 07:14.057
How do you suppose he became
trapped in the wind tunnel?

07:14.167 --> 07:15.600
Someone must have shut him in.

07:15.668 --> 07:18.569
- The door is operated from there.
- By computer?

07:18.638 --> 07:21.766
I've already been through this with the police.

07:21.841 --> 07:25.572
Another member of your team
died recently. Isn't that correct?

07:25.645 --> 07:27.704
Yes. Arthur Grable.

07:27.814 --> 07:31.250
He was killed in an automobile
accident in November.

07:31.317 --> 07:34.218
I'm Frank Nollette. I'm also on the project.

07:34.287 --> 07:38.018
- Are you certain it was an accident?
- What are you driving at?

07:39.125 --> 07:43.323
Your work seems to be a perfect target
for industrial espionage.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.126
Who wrote this?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.398
Ron was working on it when I left.

07:54.474 --> 07:59.241
The handwriting here doesn't seem
to match any of the other handwriting.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.108
It isn't mine.

08:05.618 --> 08:07.677
What about Roland Fuller?

08:07.753 --> 08:11.052
Roland's the... janitor.

08:11.123 --> 08:15.059
According to the police report,
he was the only other person here.

08:15.127 --> 08:18.153
- Roland didn't do that.
- How do you know?

08:19.265 --> 08:22.894
Let's just say Roland isn't
exactly a rocket scientist.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.039
Here.

08:39.385 --> 08:40.977
Tracy.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.518
With stars.

08:45.057 --> 08:46.388
Roland?

08:46.492 --> 08:50.087
There are some people here
would like to talk with you.

08:53.299 --> 08:55.062
I went off the paper.

08:56.669 --> 08:59.001
- Sorry.
- That's all right, Roland.

08:59.105 --> 09:00.595
Tracy.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.504
Would you like to come
help me in the TV room?

09:03.576 --> 09:05.134
OK.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.074
Hi, Roland. Mind if we sit down?

09:10.883 --> 09:12.874
Thanks.

09:12.985 --> 09:15.920
Do you mind if we ask you
a couple of questions?

09:17.623 --> 09:20.353
Do you remember working last night?

09:21.694 --> 09:26.324
Do you remember seeing anything unusual?
Seeing any strangers?

09:29.702 --> 09:31.226
Did...

09:31.337 --> 09:33.601
Did Dr Surnow or Dr Keats

09:33.706 --> 09:36.174
or Dr Nollette do anything unusual?

09:37.376 --> 09:38.638
Nope.

09:43.716 --> 09:45.775
You must like stars.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.550
One hundred and forty-seven.

09:49.388 --> 09:52.585
- Sorry?
- Stars.

09:59.231 --> 10:01.324
You like numbers too, huh?

10:18.017 --> 10:20.076
Roland, let me help you.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.344
One... two...

10:23.189 --> 10:24.087
three...

10:24.190 --> 10:27.284
four... five...

10:28.194 --> 10:29.821
six...

10:29.895 --> 10:33.194
- seven...
- Roland, is everything OK?

10:33.265 --> 10:35.699
Roland, are you all right?

10:35.801 --> 10:37.234
Eleven...

10:37.303 --> 10:40.204
- Twelve... thirteen...
- What happened?

10:40.906 --> 10:43.431
What did you say to upset him so?!

10:43.509 --> 10:44.498
Sixteen...

10:44.610 --> 10:46.237
Seventeen...

10:50.916 --> 10:54.113
It's definitely the work of a fourth individual.

10:54.220 --> 10:59.658
The doctors' cursive standards don't
match what you found on the white board.

10:59.725 --> 11:02.421
Will you do me a favor and try this?

11:03.062 --> 11:06.031
- What is it?
- Something Roland was doodling.

11:06.098 --> 11:10.797
- You don't really think Roland...
- He was the only other person in the lab.

11:10.870 --> 11:15.204
But we're talking about a sophisticated
fluid dynamics equation.

11:15.274 --> 11:17.333
Roland barely has an IQ of 70.

11:17.443 --> 11:22.710
You saw his facility with math. Don't some
autistic individuals display unusual abilities?

11:22.815 --> 11:26.478
Yes, but even savants behave
only as human calculators.

11:26.552 --> 11:29.077
They can perform certain functions

11:29.155 --> 11:33.216
but they can't tell you the value
of anything or the meaning.

11:33.292 --> 11:35.886
I hate to take sides,
but the bottom line is no.

11:35.961 --> 11:40.125
The terminal stroke on the six,
the roof on the five...

11:40.900 --> 11:43.300
I'm sorry. He didn't write it.

14:06.478 --> 14:11.575
An organic object exposed to liquid nitrogen
at minus 320 degrees will freeze,

14:11.650 --> 14:14.448
exhibiting great tensile strength,

14:14.520 --> 14:18.320
but is vulnerable to stress
from compression or impact.

14:18.424 --> 14:21.393
I've seen this demonstrated on a fish before.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.623
I don't think they'll do this
on Beakman's World.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.992
Has this been dusted?

14:29.068 --> 14:31.195
- Treat yourself.
- Thanks.

14:39.111 --> 14:41.238
Hey, Scully! Look at these files.

14:42.514 --> 14:44.607
KMAN must be Keats.

14:44.683 --> 14:47.880
This file was turned off at 12:31 last night.

14:48.754 --> 14:53.453
But look. Someone else entered a file
under the name ARTHUR after 12:31.

14:53.525 --> 14:56.016
And worked on it for nearly five hours.

14:56.161 --> 14:58.425
Well, it couldn't have been Keats.

14:58.497 --> 15:02.763
Judging from the rigor of the body,
he was dead around 12:30.

15:02.868 --> 15:05.302
So someone came in, killed Keats,

15:05.371 --> 15:08.772
and then just did some work
on an old Dr Grable file?

15:13.746 --> 15:16.943
I can't access the ARTHUR file.
We'll need the password.

15:18.517 --> 15:21.543
Try... 15626.

15:32.531 --> 15:34.590
How did you know that that?

15:34.700 --> 15:39.603
This is Arthur Grable's work on the same
equations the others were working on.

15:39.705 --> 15:42.173
Look at all those entries.

15:43.876 --> 15:47.073
Someone has been continuing
his work since he died.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.911
How did you know what the password was?

16:00.225 --> 16:02.625
Wave goodbye! Wave goodbye!

16:06.498 --> 16:08.693
Wave goodbye! Bye-bye!

16:10.169 --> 16:11.534
Wave goodbye!

16:16.508 --> 16:18.169
Roland?

16:21.313 --> 16:23.804
Why did you sleep in your clothes?

16:27.386 --> 16:31.220
Well, let's get you dressed.
You have visitors.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.800
I'm not supposed to talk to them.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.133
Who told you that?

16:47.973 --> 16:49.338
Remember that talk we had

16:49.408 --> 16:51.467
about being shy?

16:53.045 --> 16:55.138
These are nice people, Roland.

17:05.089 --> 17:08.059
Hey, Roland, you've got more shirts than I do.

17:08.193 --> 17:11.594
This one would look stylin' today.
What do you think?

17:11.663 --> 17:13.756
- The green one.
- The green one?

17:13.832 --> 17:15.424
Please.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.801
Mrs Stodie, can I talk to you a second?

17:20.105 --> 17:21.231
See you later, Roland.

17:24.510 --> 17:26.603
This one?

17:26.678 --> 17:28.771
There you go.

17:29.081 --> 17:32.642
- Do you like yourjob at the college, Roland?
- Yes.

17:33.585 --> 17:35.644
I hear you're very good at it.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.687
Do you remember how you got yourjob?

17:41.260 --> 17:43.319
A man talked to Mrs Stodie.

17:43.429 --> 17:45.329
What man?

17:46.331 --> 17:48.424
Dr Grable.

17:49.601 --> 17:51.660
Was Dr Grable nice to you?

17:52.538 --> 17:54.028
Yes.

17:54.106 --> 17:56.074
When did you last speak to him?

17:59.478 --> 18:02.038
Last week? The day before?

18:04.149 --> 18:06.276
Dr Grable died.

18:10.489 --> 18:13.049
I'm sorry.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.221
People die.

18:17.296 --> 18:19.355
They go away.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.658
And they're not supposed to come back.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.433
Has Roland ever mentioned the name Arthur?

18:29.508 --> 18:33.501
That was Dr Grable's first name,
but we only called him Dr Grable.

18:33.579 --> 18:36.571
I doubt Roland even knew
his first name was Arthur.

18:36.682 --> 18:41.449
Mrs Stodie, can I get a copy
of Roland's file and past history?

18:41.520 --> 18:46.753
- Our patients' histories are confidential.
- I understand, but I can obtain them.

18:46.859 --> 18:51.262
The less time we spend in court,
the more time we have to help Roland.

18:51.363 --> 18:53.763
Roland Fuller was hired by Arthur Grable.

18:53.866 --> 18:57.358
He specifically wanted
a mentally challenged person.

18:57.469 --> 19:01.405
Are you suggesting Arthur Grable
hired Roland in order to use him?

19:02.875 --> 19:05.571
Are you suggesting
Arthur Grable is not dead?

19:06.311 --> 19:09.474
If he had intentions of killing
Nollette, Keats and Surnow,

19:09.548 --> 19:13.006
why not set it up to appear
the least likely suspect?

19:13.118 --> 19:15.951
But, by the look of this, he's hamburger.

19:16.021 --> 19:18.114
Maybe he staged it.

19:18.891 --> 19:24.022
That would explain why his work is
continuing on, six months after his... death.

19:24.129 --> 19:29.226
This obituary says Arthur Grable was born
in Seattle. His father was a big banker.

19:29.334 --> 19:32.167
His mother was active
in a number of charities.

19:32.304 --> 19:34.795
Only child. Summa cum laude in physics.

19:34.907 --> 19:39.640
Doctoral and postdoctoral in
aeronautical engineering at Harvey Mudd.

19:39.745 --> 19:42.771
Brilliant future tragically cut short.

19:43.382 --> 19:45.441
Roland's also from Seattle.

19:46.385 --> 19:49.115
He spent most of his life
at the Heritage Halfway House.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.055
The identity of his parents
has been sealed.

19:52.191 --> 19:57.720
There's very little information before
the age of three, when he went to the home.

19:57.796 --> 19:59.354
Does it say when he was born?

20:02.134 --> 20:04.398
July 15, 1952.

20:10.676 --> 20:12.837
That's also Arthur's birth date.

20:23.655 --> 20:25.748
Don't you wish you could fly?

20:26.391 --> 20:28.450
I can.

20:29.094 --> 20:31.187
When I dream.

20:33.031 --> 20:36.398
People can do anything
in a dream, you know.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.396
Once...

20:40.472 --> 20:44.704
One time I had a dream we were married

20:45.310 --> 20:47.369
and lived in a house.

20:49.448 --> 20:52.383
Do you have dreams, Roland?

21:01.827 --> 21:03.886
You can tell me.

21:05.297 --> 21:06.491
Roland?

21:07.399 --> 21:09.458
Who's Arthur?

21:19.611 --> 21:22.444
I'm sorry, Roland!

21:22.514 --> 21:25.210
I'm sorry!

21:30.622 --> 21:32.681
Roland!

21:36.728 --> 21:38.127
Roland!

21:38.230 --> 21:40.323
Go away!

21:44.469 --> 21:46.528
Roland! What's the matter?

21:46.638 --> 21:48.697
Go away!

21:49.107 --> 21:51.166
I don't want to hurt you!

21:52.477 --> 21:54.536
Go away!

21:58.884 --> 22:00.943
Go away.

22:05.257 --> 22:07.919
- Is that you?
- Yes.

22:07.993 --> 22:08.891
Cool do!

22:09.761 --> 22:11.126
What's the story here?

22:16.335 --> 22:20.533
A quantum physics professor of mine
at Harvey Mudd... flunked me.

22:20.605 --> 22:23.904
He challenged a tenet of one of my theories.

22:23.975 --> 22:26.375
A theory I later published in Nature.

22:26.478 --> 22:28.969
Anyway... to get back at him...

22:29.081 --> 22:32.812
One afternoon
we decided to take his car apart

22:32.918 --> 22:36.718
and put it back together again
in his office, and left it running.

22:36.788 --> 22:40.485
- An egghead classic.
- It was Arthur Grable's idea.

22:40.625 --> 22:44.220
- Is that Arthur Grable sitting on the chair?
- Yeah.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.890
- Was he a practical joker?
- Atop of all his brilliance

22:47.966 --> 22:50.526
he had a genius for elaborate schemes.

22:50.702 --> 22:55.162
Could he be making it seem like a man
with a 70 IQ is gaining access to

22:55.240 --> 22:58.038
and... operating his old computer files?

23:00.379 --> 23:02.711
Arthur would still have to be alive.

23:02.781 --> 23:06.182
- Could he have faked his own death?
- No.

23:06.251 --> 23:10.017
The police report on the auto accident
was woefully incomplete.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.920
A dry road surface. No mechanical problems.

23:12.991 --> 23:18.019
The body was never admitted to
a county morgue and there was no funeral.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.655
If you are trying

23:20.766 --> 23:27.069
to suggest that Arthur Grable killed
Surnow and Keats, and is after me next,

23:27.172 --> 23:28.196
you're way off.

23:29.775 --> 23:32.266
Art could not have done the murders.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.073
How can you be so certain?

23:38.617 --> 23:39.982
This is Arthur Grable.

23:40.051 --> 23:43.748
Because of massive damage to
his body caused by the accident

23:43.822 --> 23:46.052
we could only preserve the head.

23:47.058 --> 23:49.185
Wouldn't your client find it inconvenient

23:49.261 --> 23:54.096
to be thawed out in the future, only
to discover he had no functional mobility?

23:54.199 --> 23:57.965
By the time science figures
a way to revive our clients...

23:58.069 --> 24:01.505
- You'll also know how to clone new bodies.
- Exactly!

24:01.606 --> 24:07.238
This technology is progressing faster than
anyone thought possible. Ask anyone here.

24:07.312 --> 24:12.011
While for us the passing of each second
brings our bodies closer to death,

24:12.083 --> 24:15.246
for our clients it brings them closer to life.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.221
These fluctuations - do they happen often?

24:21.293 --> 24:24.592
We've had some problems
with Dr Grable's capsule.

24:24.663 --> 24:27.689
Our technicians checked it
and found nothing.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.063
Is it possible the brain is causing it?

24:30.902 --> 24:31.926
No.

24:32.037 --> 24:34.597
But we are looking for the explanation.

24:34.673 --> 24:39.872
The patient remains preserved as long as
there's liquid nitrogen in the capsule.

24:39.945 --> 24:42.914
May we take a look at
Arthur Grable's records?

24:47.853 --> 24:49.912
Thank you.

24:54.059 --> 24:57.085
Dr Barrington, as to future medical science,

24:57.162 --> 25:00.620
what requirements will exist
to be an organ donor?

25:00.699 --> 25:05.693
Same as today - compatible genetic make-up.
It's best if the donor's related.

25:08.473 --> 25:09.906
Mulder.

25:13.912 --> 25:16.437
Arthur Grable put down only one donor.

25:17.482 --> 25:21.111
Roland Fuller and Arthur Grable
have the same birthday.

25:21.553 --> 25:23.646
I think they're twins.

25:25.924 --> 25:27.186
Older or younger?

25:27.292 --> 25:31.524
Same age. Just less hairy
and with better eyesight.

25:31.596 --> 25:35.191
- Gotcha. And the mustache?
- No, lose the whole beard.

25:41.172 --> 25:42.196
Next?

25:42.307 --> 25:45.799
Close-cropped hair,
with a slightly receding widow's peak.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.944
Lose the glasses.

25:56.955 --> 25:59.753
- That's Roland.
- Give or take a few pounds.

26:08.433 --> 26:10.594
Tell me about your dreams, Roland.

26:16.641 --> 26:19.041
It's all right. I won't tell anybody.

26:24.749 --> 26:27.309
You know, I had a dream last night.

26:29.354 --> 26:32.323
I dreamt I was swimming in this pool.

26:33.625 --> 26:36.025
And I could see my father underwater.

26:36.962 --> 26:39.829
But when I dove down,
the water stung my eyes.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.160
And there was another man at the pool,

26:44.235 --> 26:46.328
watching me.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.664
He upset me.

26:49.474 --> 26:52.739
He was asking me questions
I didn't want to answer.

26:54.346 --> 26:56.439
I had to leave.

26:56.948 --> 26:59.007
I couldn't find my father.

27:05.957 --> 27:08.949
I can't tell you my dreams.

27:09.861 --> 27:12.295
Why not?

27:15.834 --> 27:17.597
Bad.

27:20.705 --> 27:23.640
Your dreams are bad, Roland.

27:24.209 --> 27:25.699
Not you.

27:26.811 --> 27:28.642
You're a good person.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.578
I hit Tracy.

27:39.591 --> 27:42.253
Your dreams make you hit Tracy?

28:13.158 --> 28:14.682
You know how to work this toy, Roland?

28:17.729 --> 28:19.822
Here.

28:39.517 --> 28:42.315
You see, the way you work that toy,

28:42.987 --> 28:45.251
is like what's happening to you.

28:47.525 --> 28:49.584
You're the spaceship, Roland.

28:51.596 --> 28:53.757
And your dreams are the controls.

28:58.903 --> 29:01.371
Who...

29:02.607 --> 29:04.700
Who runs the controls?

29:09.748 --> 29:12.148
Have you seen this man recently?

29:19.390 --> 29:22.757
Come on, Arthur.
We have to say bye-bye to Roland.

29:23.795 --> 29:24.989
Bye.

29:30.602 --> 29:31.694
Roland...

29:31.770 --> 29:33.704
Roland!

29:33.772 --> 29:35.831
Roland, stop!

29:36.775 --> 29:39.141
Roland!

29:49.120 --> 29:51.987
- Roland!
- We need to keep Roland under observation.

29:56.961 --> 29:59.020
Roland!

29:59.597 --> 30:02.259
- He's trying to get away.
- Roland!

30:04.435 --> 30:06.335
Roland!

30:24.956 --> 30:29.154
Nollette's gone. We should arrange
a security guard to find him.

30:29.227 --> 30:31.661
No one's gonna provide anything

30:31.763 --> 30:36.029
once you explain how Roland Fuller
is capable of these murders.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.762
You've got a brother, don't you, Scully?

30:38.837 --> 30:41.704
Yeah. I've got an older one
and a younger one.

30:41.806 --> 30:47.073
Have you ever thought about calling one
of them, and then suddenly they call you?

30:47.178 --> 30:50.670
Is this a way for me to lower
my long-distance charges?

30:50.782 --> 30:53.012
I believe in psychic connections.

30:53.084 --> 30:58.078
Evidence suggests it's stronger between
family members. Especially twin siblings.

30:58.189 --> 31:03.855
OK... Maybe. But in this case, one sibling
has closer ties to a frozen fudgsicle

31:03.928 --> 31:06.488
than he does to his own brother.

31:06.631 --> 31:11.625
Arthur Grable is not dead. He's in a state of
consciousness no human has returned from.

31:11.703 --> 31:15.002
What if that state allows one
to develop psychic ability

31:15.073 --> 31:18.839
that the conscious mind is too
preoccupied to explore or believe in?

31:18.910 --> 31:22.869
He could use that to control
his brother to kill the scientists.

31:22.947 --> 31:26.110
But why? He's been working
with them for years.

31:26.217 --> 31:29.653
That's a question
only Dr Nollette can answer.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.814
OK. Let's go.

31:32.690 --> 31:33.884
I have to call my brother.

31:36.761 --> 31:39.161
We've got to fiind Nollette.

31:39.664 --> 31:42.258
Let's talk to campus security.

31:42.333 --> 31:45.063
- We go this way?
- No, we go left.

32:08.126 --> 32:10.151
Well,

32:10.261 --> 32:12.855
wherever you are, Arthur,

32:13.898 --> 32:16.162
I'm sure you'll appreciate this.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.409
Arthur and Roland Grable,

34:15.485 --> 34:20.856
born at Puget Presbyterian to
Mr and Mrs Lewis Grable on July 15th, 1952.

34:20.925 --> 34:24.053
Arthur was four minutes older than Roland.

34:24.128 --> 34:26.926
Identical twins.

34:27.031 --> 34:32.230
Which means that they're the result of
a single egg fertilized by a single sperm.

34:33.504 --> 34:36.029
Studies suggest that in some cases

34:36.107 --> 34:39.907
the identical twin arises early
in the embryonic stage.

34:40.011 --> 34:42.878
A mutation in one cell is rejected
by other cells as foreign.

34:42.947 --> 34:48.248
Roland's condition is the result of a damaged
chromosome rejected by Arthur's cells?

34:48.319 --> 34:52.551
In a way, that would explain Arthur's genius
and Roland's mathematical gift.

34:53.291 --> 34:55.156
In a way.

34:57.161 --> 34:58.253
Agent Scully.

34:58.329 --> 35:01.696
This is Larry Barrington
at the Avalon Foundation.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.028
We've got a situation here.

35:04.335 --> 35:07.236
Last night we had a break-in at the facility.

35:08.439 --> 35:09.371
That's right.

35:09.474 --> 35:11.669
It's Arthur Grable's storage unit.

35:11.742 --> 35:14.040
His thermostat's been compromised.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.548
- Was there any tissue damage?
- We're trying to assess that now.

35:17.682 --> 35:23.086
The temperature's still rising. Something's
blocking our access to the cooling program.

35:24.922 --> 35:27.322
Someone tampered with
Arthur Grable's capsule.

35:27.391 --> 35:29.586
They're attempting to stabilize it.

35:31.262 --> 35:33.287
Nollette?

36:26.250 --> 36:28.343
What...

36:29.153 --> 36:31.018
What is this?

37:01.452 --> 37:04.148
If I have seen further than other men,

37:06.157 --> 37:09.422
it's because I have stood
on the shoulders of giants.

37:11.762 --> 37:13.821
No...

37:15.766 --> 37:17.825
This isn't yours.

37:18.803 --> 37:21.271
It's amazing.

37:21.372 --> 37:26.002
There's this body,
sitting there in front of me, talking.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.409
But you're controlling it, Arthur.

37:30.615 --> 37:31.809
You...

37:32.450 --> 37:35.112
took my work!

37:36.087 --> 37:38.715
What good was your work going to do you?

37:38.889 --> 37:43.258
You died before you could finish it,
before you could publish it.

37:43.327 --> 37:45.420
It was mine!

37:45.529 --> 37:47.827
And a brilliant piece of work, too.

37:47.898 --> 37:51.857
When I saw the writing on the board,
I knew someone had found the key.

37:51.936 --> 37:56.498
Mach 15 was within our reach.
Our futures were guaranteed.

37:57.241 --> 37:59.334
Ironic, isn't it?

37:59.443 --> 38:03.106
You did all the work, and I get all the glory.

38:03.314 --> 38:05.248
No!

38:05.316 --> 38:07.409
Yes.

38:08.319 --> 38:10.412
Yes, Arthur.

38:10.488 --> 38:13.355
I was here, working on the intake problem,

38:13.457 --> 38:17.257
moments away from a solution,
when you attacked me.

38:17.328 --> 38:19.762
Fortunately, I was carrying a gun.

38:20.431 --> 38:23.491
After the murder of my colleagues,
who could blame me?

38:25.870 --> 38:27.030
That's... That's interesting.

38:30.074 --> 38:32.133
I've got it!

38:32.243 --> 38:34.302
That's it!

38:35.713 --> 38:37.476
I've got it!

39:36.741 --> 39:38.106
Arthur!

39:42.713 --> 39:44.738
Arthur! Open the door!

40:20.851 --> 40:22.284
Arthur,

40:22.386 --> 40:25.480
how do you stop this? Tell me how!

40:25.589 --> 40:27.682
- Arthur!
- Hey!

40:27.825 --> 40:30.658
Roland, we need you to help us.

40:30.761 --> 40:33.958
Please, we need you
to help us to stop the machine.

40:37.835 --> 40:39.302
Try to remember how.

40:41.872 --> 40:44.966
Roland, you've got to help him
or he's going to die.

40:50.247 --> 40:52.442
Wave goodbye, Arthur!

41:13.337 --> 41:16.397
- Come on, Roland.
- I can't remember!

41:57.681 --> 42:01.173
He'll be held in psychiatric
custody for evaluation.

42:01.285 --> 42:07.053
- Is he being charged with a crime?
- The DA hasn't made that determination yet.

42:07.124 --> 42:12.187
We've recommended he be remanded to
your custody as soon as the court allows it.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.323
How could this happen?

42:15.399 --> 42:18.562
Roland never exhibited
any violent tendencies.

42:19.003 --> 42:22.769
It's my belief that he wasn't
acting under his own volition.

42:22.907 --> 42:24.966
What do you mean?

42:25.075 --> 42:27.771
This is the work of Arthur, Roland's brother.

42:27.912 --> 42:31.006
It's a new theory of
jet propulsion, unfinished.

42:31.215 --> 42:35.083
In the last two weeks, Roland
has completed the calculations.

42:36.153 --> 42:37.177
How?

42:37.288 --> 42:40.951
We're not sure. All we know
is that Roland was somehow

42:41.025 --> 42:43.994
able to finish his brother's research.

43:02.613 --> 43:04.706
Roland?

43:08.185 --> 43:10.244
Where are you going?

43:13.657 --> 43:15.750
Roland, don't go.

43:16.060 --> 43:18.153
I have to.

43:19.363 --> 43:21.422
OK. Bye.

43:23.434 --> 43:25.527
Tracy...

43:27.538 --> 43:29.597
Wait.

43:42.820 --> 43:44.947
Keep my stars.

43:57.601 --> 43:59.660
I love you.

44:02.039 --> 44:04.098
Me, too.
