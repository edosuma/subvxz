Woodchuck Weekend ever!

00:12.750 --> 00:15.500
This is our opportunity
to plan every activity
for the camp,

00:15.500 --> 00:17.080
so we've gotta go big!

00:17.080 --> 00:19.120
Well, whatever we do,
it's gonna be better than
Weasel Weekend.

00:19.120 --> 00:23.210
Yeah, Hazel just threw
rocks at us for two days.

00:23.210 --> 00:27.330
Although, that Emma pinata
was remarkably realistic.

00:27.330 --> 00:28.620
Oh, that wasn't a pinata.

00:28.620 --> 00:31.880
She just told the campers
to hit me with sticks.

00:31.880 --> 00:34.120
Lou, your parents
are on the phone.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.120
It seems pretty important.

00:35.120 --> 00:38.040
I'll just take it outside.

00:38.040 --> 00:42.460
You know, it's not too late
to go with my idea
for Woodchuck Weekend.

00:42.460 --> 00:46.670
Zuri, for the last time,
we are not taking the campers
to Country Music Land.

00:46.670 --> 00:49.170
But they just got a new
roller coaster.

00:49.170 --> 00:51.330
Blake Shelton's Shockwave!

00:51.330 --> 00:53.540
It's got more ups and downs
than his love life.

00:56.330 --> 00:58.250
Lou, what's wrong?

01:00.250 --> 01:02.290
My dog Hank just died.

01:02.290 --> 01:03.750
Oh, no... Hank?

01:03.750 --> 01:05.080
You've had him
your whole life!

01:06.000 --> 01:07.830
I'm so sorry, Lou.

01:07.830 --> 01:09.120
Me, too.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.920
Thanks, guys.

01:11.920 --> 01:14.580
But Hank had a good long life.

01:16.420 --> 01:18.580
I guess it was just his time.

01:18.580 --> 01:20.120
I remember the first time
I met Hank.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.580
He tackled me so hard
I fell into your hay baler.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.250
I had to get stitches.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.250
Oh, sweetie. Is that why
your ear looks so weird?

01:27.250 --> 01:29.040
I got the stitches in my arm.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.210
What's wrong with my ear?

01:31.120 --> 01:32.170
Nothing!

No, I'm dressed up

to get boys.

02:42.460 --> 02:44.580
(LAUGHS) Of course I'm ready!

02:44.580 --> 02:46.210
Ooh, nice tail, by the way.

02:46.210 --> 02:48.170
I do not wear it often.

Oh, how cute. You're both

I would look like my pillow.

Wait, are you playing
Mega Mutants?

03:10.920 --> 03:13.170
Yes, yes, we get it.
We're nerds.

03:13.170 --> 03:18.170
Destined to die alone,
feasted upon by the cats
we so adored.

03:18.170 --> 03:23.330
All of that is true, but...
I also love  Mega Mutants.

03:23.330 --> 03:25.170
It's my favorite
role playing game!

03:25.170 --> 03:27.210
Pssh, yeah, right.

03:27.210 --> 03:30.250
That is as preposterous
as a Level Two Mutant

03:30.250 --> 03:32.710
thinking she can defeat
Dr. Lobotomy

03:32.710 --> 03:36.250
without the Hauser knife.
(LAUGHING)

03:36.250 --> 03:40.290
Um, I wouldn't need
the Hauser Knife,
because I'm a Level Four,

03:40.290 --> 03:42.170
and I'm always packin'
fire dust!

03:43.120 --> 03:46.210
Boom! Boom! Boom!

03:46.210 --> 03:47.710
(GASPS) You do play!

03:47.710 --> 03:49.210
TIFFANY: Awesome!

03:49.210 --> 03:51.120
I was just a humble
violin prodigy

03:51.120 --> 03:53.960
until gamma rays from
a faulty vending machine

03:53.960 --> 03:58.420
reconfigured my genes,
and turned me into... Violina!

03:58.420 --> 04:03.210
I, of course,
am the Mutant Master,
Lizardo the Wise.

04:03.210 --> 04:06.080

narrator,

04:06.080 --> 04:07.330

04:08.380 --> 04:10.880
I play as Psytress.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.420
My pigtails give me the power
to control minds.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.250
If only it worked
in real life.

04:16.250 --> 04:19.120
Oh, the things
I would make Xander do.

04:19.710 --> 04:21.420
Like braid your hair?

04:21.420 --> 04:22.920
Yeah, let's go with that.

04:27.500 --> 04:31.620
Eww, my lunch has a paw in it.

04:31.620 --> 04:34.830
And that's not even
the grossest part.

04:34.830 --> 04:37.380
Apparently,
someone stole all the
good meat out of the kitchen.

04:37.380 --> 04:41.750
So instead of pulled pork,
we're having pulled porcupine.

04:41.750 --> 04:44.580
On the bright side,
it comes with a
free toothpick.

04:48.290 --> 04:49.670
I'm not that hungry anyway.

04:49.670 --> 04:51.170
I just feel so bad for Lou.

04:51.170 --> 04:53.460
Hank was her oldest friend.
I know.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.330
She said when she was
growing up, she never went
anywhere without him.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.960
Like me and a platinum card.

Wow Lou...
You look... Festive.

05:06.210 --> 05:09.460
C'mon bestie, let's go make
you a hat like mine.

05:09.460 --> 05:11.040
I taught you how to
skin a rat, right?

05:12.830 --> 05:14.250
That's weird.

05:14.250 --> 05:16.170
Lou doesn't seem to be sad
about Hank at all.

05:16.170 --> 05:20.460
The really weird thing is
they're going to look for
rats in the kitchen.

05:28.170 --> 05:29.420

05:31.250 --> 05:35.790
Your quest begins
outside a top secret
military compound.

05:35.790 --> 05:40.670
My lizard senses tell me
the Golden Gauntlet is there.

05:40.670 --> 05:42.330
We choose to
explore the compound!

05:42.330 --> 05:43.750
Very well,

05:45.250 --> 05:48.290
but this is also
where the government performs

05:48.290 --> 05:52.830
sinister experiments
on mutants such as yourselves.

05:52.830 --> 05:57.120
Those jerk-faces!
All we want is to live
in harmony with humans!

05:57.120 --> 05:59.420
When will they learn?

06:00.790 --> 06:03.290
Your shouting,
while a bold character choice,

06:03.290 --> 06:06.210
has alerted the guard mutants.

06:06.210 --> 06:08.080
Lizardo's tail tingles...

06:10.540 --> 06:14.080
You now find yourselves

(GASPS) Level Nine,
Rhino-doodle!

06:17.750 --> 06:19.920
Half rhino, half poodle,

06:19.920 --> 06:22.750
it is as vicious as it is
hypoallergenic.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.170
Psytress, we cannot
fight a Level Nine!

06:27.170 --> 06:29.540
But I can use
my power of song

06:29.540 --> 06:31.830
to distract it
while we run away.

Is it wrong that I am scared
and titillated?

06:43.620 --> 06:45.040
Ew, yes.

06:46.750 --> 06:49.120
Psytress, your mutant
powers alone

06:49.120 --> 06:51.120
are not strong enough
to defeat it.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.710
You have to roll a six to win.

06:53.710 --> 06:56.750
Done! We're getting
that Gauntlet!

charges,

07:03.960 --> 07:07.120
knocking Psytress unconscious!

07:07.120 --> 07:10.290
He drags you both
into the compound,

07:10.290 --> 07:15.250
and fuses your bodies together
into one terrifyingly
grotesque mutant!

in this canteen!

No, that was just water.
Lizardo enjoys a good prank.

Tiffany! You're snoring again.

07:47.120 --> 07:51.670
Yeah, knock it off,
or I'll have to use
my anti-snoring device.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.290
Hey, I don't snore anymore!

07:56.290 --> 07:59.420
Mostly, because I'm
too afraid to go to sleep.

Yeah, swell. Never better.

Lou, we're here for you
if you want to talk about him.

09:01.210 --> 09:03.540
I don't want to
talk about him, okay?

09:03.540 --> 09:07.330
He's gone, and I didn't even
get a chance to say goodbye.

09:07.330 --> 09:10.500
Aww, Lou. He knows
how much you loved him.

09:12.210 --> 09:13.460
I really did.

09:14.250 --> 09:15.670
Come here.

09:19.330 --> 09:24.040
You know, when Hank
would give me a hug,

09:24.040 --> 09:27.120
he'd bury his nose
in my neck and slobber
all over my shirt.

09:28.330 --> 09:31.040
He was my big, cuddly,
drool faucet!

09:34.500 --> 09:36.000

10:02.540 --> 10:05.120
peanut butter and jellyfish.

10:05.120 --> 10:08.880
This is so easy!
Now that we are combined
into a single mutant,

10:08.880 --> 10:13.620

all we have to roll is a one
and we crush everything!

10:13.620 --> 10:17.080

being crushed is my spine.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.080

that compound for the Gauntlet
without getting caught.

This is the greatest
Mega Mutants quest
I've ever been on!

10:49.330 --> 10:51.750
This is even more fun
than when I told the campers

10:51.750 --> 10:54.540
to smack the candy
right out of Emma.

10:54.540 --> 10:57.460
Yeah, we make a
really great team.

10:57.460 --> 10:59.120
Well, I gotta go.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.670
You can only leave
campers locked
in a tool shed for so long

11:01.670 --> 11:03.290
before their air runs low.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.250
Bye-eee!

11:08.920 --> 11:11.330
Did Hazel just... Hug us?

11:11.330 --> 11:13.540
Yeah. Oddly enough,

11:13.540 --> 11:16.500
she's much nicer
as a mind-controlling mutant.

11:20.420 --> 11:24.210
I feel terrible for Lou,
but I'm glad she's finally
dealing with her loss.

11:24.210 --> 11:25.540
She really loved that dog.

11:25.540 --> 11:26.960
Hank was the best!

11:26.960 --> 11:29.120
He had the cutest way of
saying hello to me.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.170
He'd grab my leg in his mouth,
and start pulling

11:31.170 --> 11:33.460
until it felt like my leg was
gonna rip right off.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.880
(LAUGHS) Ah, good times.

11:37.290 --> 11:39.040
Uh, sweetie...

11:39.040 --> 11:41.830
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe Hank
didn't like you?

11:41.830 --> 11:43.500
What?

11:43.500 --> 11:45.330
If he didn't like me,
then why was he always
flashing his teeth at me,

11:45.330 --> 11:48.790
and playfully growling,
and oh my gosh, he hated me.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.040
(EXCLAIMS)

11:52.920 --> 11:54.170
Lou?

11:54.170 --> 11:57.420
You look... Great.

11:57.420 --> 12:00.790
Just um...
I'm lookin' for tissues.

12:00.790 --> 12:03.290
Thought Gladys might
have some in the mess hall.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.710
That's where she reads her
Internet dating rejections.

12:06.540 --> 12:08.380
Hey, Lou.

12:08.380 --> 12:12.000
As part of Woodchuck Weekend,
we're teaching the
campers how to plant a tree.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.210
You want to help?
It might cheer you up.

12:14.210 --> 12:16.420
Yeah, it combines your
two favorite things.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.040
Teaching kids, and mulch.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.250
I do like mulch.

12:21.620 --> 12:25.290
But I'll just hang back
and let you guys
do your thing.

12:26.210 --> 12:28.250
Okay.

12:28.250 --> 12:31.420
Now, kids, the first step
when planting a tree
is to dig a hole.

12:31.420 --> 12:33.290
Dig.

12:33.290 --> 12:34.750
Ol' Hank loved to dig.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.170
Sorry, carry on.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.000
And when you're holding
the sapling, be careful.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.920
The bark is still delicate.
Bark.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.750
You know who had a great bark?

12:47.750 --> 12:48.880
Hank!

12:50.420 --> 12:52.170
Poor Lou.

12:52.170 --> 12:55.290
Let me get you a hankie.
Hankie?

12:55.290 --> 12:57.540
That's what I
used to call him.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.920
(SOBS)

12:59.920 --> 13:01.290
(CRYING LOUDLY)

13:02.790 --> 13:04.540
You couldn't have said tissue?

13:10.250 --> 13:12.250
Careful. All the good meat's
been taken,

13:12.250 --> 13:14.170
so who knows
what's in that burger.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.210
Or why it's leaving.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.250
(GASPS) There you are,
Psytress!

13:29.250 --> 13:31.880
(MAKING VIOLIN NOISES)

13:31.880 --> 13:33.170
(LAUGHS)

13:33.170 --> 13:36.040
Don't look at me.
I barely know them.

13:36.040 --> 13:41.000
We made you your very own
actual invisibility cloak!

13:41.000 --> 13:42.920
(BOTH VOCALIZING)

13:44.080 --> 13:45.580
BOTH: Freaks of Nature...

13:45.580 --> 13:47.620
Get lost.

13:47.620 --> 13:51.250
Look, you are clearly
at the wrong table,
dorksickles.

13:51.250 --> 13:54.460
Now get that ugly rag
out of my face.

13:54.460 --> 13:58.040
Dweeboids, am I right?
(LAUGHTER)

13:58.040 --> 13:59.380
Come on, Lizardo.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.040
Just like in  Mega Mutants,

14:01.040 --> 14:04.040
weirdos like us
have to stick to our own kind.

14:04.040 --> 14:07.040
Let us go while we still
have a shred of dignity.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.880
Violina, you are standing
on my tail.

14:19.250 --> 14:20.620
(SIGHS)

14:21.580 --> 14:22.580
Lou,

14:23.620 --> 14:25.670
we're so sorry.

14:25.670 --> 14:27.620
Yeah, we didn't mean
to upset you.

14:27.620 --> 14:30.330
We were trying to
make you feel better.

14:30.330 --> 14:33.210
Nothing can make me
feel better.

14:33.210 --> 14:35.290
My best friend
in the whole world is gone.

14:36.330 --> 14:38.120
I just don't think
I can do this.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.750
If you aren't up for
Woodchuck Weekend,
don't worry.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.120
We can have it next month.

14:42.120 --> 14:45.080
Yeah, take all the time
you need.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.250
And if you need to cry,
this shirt's already ruined.

14:47.250 --> 14:49.710
So snot 'em if you got 'em.

14:49.710 --> 14:53.250
I'm not just talking about
Woodchuck Weekend.

14:53.250 --> 14:55.170
(GASPS) Guys,
I'm sorry, but...

14:56.210 --> 14:58.580
I'm leaving Camp Kikiwaka.

14:58.580 --> 15:00.330
What?
No!

15:00.330 --> 15:01.460
You can't leave!

15:01.460 --> 15:03.120
I can't stay.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.080
I just want to go home.

15:09.620 --> 15:11.750
I can't believe
Lou is leaving us

15:11.750 --> 15:15.420
I can't believe we're losing
the only good counselor
at this camp!

15:16.540 --> 15:18.380
Oh, Zuri, I know you're upset,

15:18.380 --> 15:21.000
but there are other
good counselors here, right?

15:22.170 --> 15:23.460
You're right, Emma.

15:24.330 --> 15:27.500
Stefen in Badger cabin
is the best.

15:32.960 --> 15:36.080
I can't believe Lou's
really packing her bags
to leave camp tomorrow.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.960
And she can't stop crying.

15:37.960 --> 15:41.500
She's probably booger-blasted
every shirt Emma owns by now.

15:43.080 --> 15:44.880
I just don't know what I'm
going to do without her.

15:44.880 --> 15:48.290
A lot less laundry,
that's for sure.

15:48.290 --> 15:50.250
We just heard
that Lou is leaving camp!

15:50.250 --> 15:51.920
Zuri, what did you do?

15:51.920 --> 15:54.120
Nothing!

15:54.120 --> 15:58.250
Great. First Hazel
humiliates us in front of
everybody at lunch,

15:58.250 --> 16:02.210
and now we're going to lose
the only decent counselor
in this place?

16:02.210 --> 16:05.170
Tiffany, aren't you forgetting
about somebody?

16:05.170 --> 16:06.290
Thank you, Zuri.

16:06.290 --> 16:09.330
Oh, yeah,
Stefen in Badger cabin!

16:09.330 --> 16:10.920
He's amazing.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.210
You know,

16:14.210 --> 16:17.290
Camp Kikiwaka just won't be
the same without Lou.

16:17.290 --> 16:20.290
Yes, we must try
and convince her to stay.

16:20.290 --> 16:22.210
Look, guys,

16:22.210 --> 16:24.420
I don't want to
lose Lou either.

16:24.420 --> 16:28.170
But if she has to leave
in order to get through this,
then we have to support her.

16:28.170 --> 16:29.330
Emma's right.

16:29.330 --> 16:31.290
If this is what Lou needs,
then we should let her go.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.880
So we are to sit around
and do nothing?

16:33.880 --> 16:36.080
No.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.750
We're going to throw Lou
the best goodbye party
this camp has ever seen.

16:38.750 --> 16:41.670
We're gonna turn
Woodchuck Weekend
into Lou-lapalooza!

16:41.670 --> 16:43.120
Yeah.
That's a great idea.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.170
Lou loves a palooza!

16:45.170 --> 16:47.540
I'm in!
But don't tell my mom.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.460
She's forbidden me
to palooze.

16:53.620 --> 16:56.000
Hey, guys!
(GASPS)

16:56.000 --> 16:58.670
Hazel, what were you
doing back there?

16:58.670 --> 17:01.460
I like to lurk in the shadows,
what's it to you?

17:03.040 --> 17:05.170
And listen, about before,

17:05.170 --> 17:07.000
I just didn't want people
to think I was...

17:07.000 --> 17:08.580
A freak like us?

17:08.580 --> 17:10.000
No!

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Yeah.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.250
Okay, I get that you
don't want to be ridiculed.

17:15.250 --> 17:18.120
But you have so much fun
playing  Mega Mutants.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.960
Who cares what
other people think?

17:19.960 --> 17:22.120
Tiffany is right.

17:22.120 --> 17:24.830
I was so happy when I
figured out that other
people's opinions of me

17:24.830 --> 17:26.120
do not matter.

17:26.120 --> 17:27.710
I must be true to myself.

17:27.710 --> 17:30.210
Now I proudly
let my geek flag fly.

17:30.210 --> 17:33.420
So, you don't care that people
call you dweeb,

17:33.420 --> 17:38.170
or weakling, or lizard-loving,
sandal-wearing loser?

17:39.250 --> 17:41.580
They call me all those things?

17:41.580 --> 17:43.580
Well, those last
couple may have been me.

17:47.290 --> 17:49.330
Hey, Lou, come with me.
I want to show you something.

17:49.330 --> 17:51.290
Ah, I have to catch my bus.

17:51.290 --> 17:53.290
Don't worry,
this won't take long.

17:53.290 --> 17:56.290
But if I don't check in early,
I'll end up between some guy
who clips his toenails,

17:56.290 --> 17:59.040
and another guy
who eats the clippings.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.040
And this is why I
never ride the bus.

18:04.290 --> 18:06.580
ALL: Surprise!

18:06.580 --> 18:08.420
Oh, my overalls!

18:08.420 --> 18:09.830
What is all this?

18:09.830 --> 18:11.960
We just want to show you
how much we love you,

18:11.960 --> 18:14.830
by paying tribute
to the greatest
Woodchuck of all time.

18:14.830 --> 18:18.580
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

18:18.580 --> 18:22.250
Lou, you have meant so much
to everyone here
at Camp Kikiwaka.

18:22.250 --> 18:25.460
That is why we are throwing
what we like to call...

18:25.460 --> 18:26.580
(WHISTLES)

18:30.960 --> 18:34.620
Alollaa...up zoo?

18:34.620 --> 18:37.170
Ravi! That's supposed to say
Lou-lapalooza!

18:38.670 --> 18:40.420
You punks had one job!

18:42.710 --> 18:44.500
Don't worry, it gets better.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.620
Lou, you have shaped us
in so many amazing ways.

18:50.620 --> 18:54.210
So, we wanted to return
the favor and "shape" you.

18:57.420 --> 19:02.080
This Lou statue will forever
stand on the grounds
of Camp Kikiwaka to honor you.

19:02.080 --> 19:05.580
Because you are head
and shoulders above the rest.

19:05.580 --> 19:06.710
(CRACKS)

19:06.710 --> 19:07.790
(GASPS)

19:08.460 --> 19:10.210
Okay, just shoulders.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.170
Moving on...

19:13.170 --> 19:16.920
Lou, I've been learning
from you since the day we met.

19:16.920 --> 19:20.170
In fact, everyone at camp
has learned so much from you.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.790
These campers are all tying
different knots
that you taught them.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.170
These knots symbolize
the unbreakable bond

19:29.170 --> 19:32.170
between you and everybody
at Camp Kikiwaka.

19:33.170 --> 19:34.330
Nice work, guys.

19:34.330 --> 19:36.330
Okay, you can untie me now.

19:36.330 --> 19:37.750
(LAUGHING)

19:37.750 --> 19:39.460
Hey, come back!

19:39.460 --> 19:41.710
Ah, the old "tie 'em
and goodbye 'em."

19:41.710 --> 19:44.120
Classic.
(GROANS)

19:44.120 --> 19:46.330
Hey, get back here.

19:46.330 --> 19:49.330
And this mural represents
everything you mean to us.

19:49.330 --> 19:51.670
(GROANS)

19:51.670 --> 19:52.710
(SCREAMS)

19:56.670 --> 19:58.210
Shall we serve the cake now?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.670
Mmmm, lemon and sunscreen,
my favorite.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.080
I am so sorry, Lou.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.880
We just wanted to show you
how much you mean to us,

20:07.880 --> 20:09.540
but we couldn't even
do that right.
Actually, Emma...

20:09.540 --> 20:11.580
All we had to do was
throw a simple party

20:11.580 --> 20:13.000
and give you the tribute
you deserve...

20:13.000 --> 20:14.670
But Emma, I...
But we messed it all up!

20:14.670 --> 20:16.170
And now I'm losing
my best friend...

20:16.170 --> 20:19.920
Emma, you're not losing
your best friend!

20:19.920 --> 20:21.250
What do you mean?

20:21.250 --> 20:23.920
I mean I'm not leaving!

20:23.920 --> 20:25.080
You're not?

20:25.080 --> 20:27.290
But I thought
you wanted to go home.

20:27.290 --> 20:29.170
I did, but...

20:29.170 --> 20:32.380
After seeing everything you've
done to make me feel loved,

20:32.380 --> 20:35.920
I know this is where
I want to be.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.290
So you're staying?

20:37.290 --> 20:38.750
Absolutely!

20:38.750 --> 20:40.790
(ALL CHEERING)

20:43.460 --> 20:48.170
Thank goodness! Now Stefen
won't be the only
decent counselor here!

20:50.120 --> 20:51.380
Attention,

20:51.380 --> 20:53.080
fellow counselors,

20:53.080 --> 20:54.210
campers,

20:54.210 --> 20:55.710
boyfriends...
Nope.

20:57.380 --> 20:59.620
Hazel, what are you doing?

20:59.620 --> 21:02.420
Guys, I'm really sorry
about dissing you earlier.

21:02.420 --> 21:03.580
But you're right.

21:03.580 --> 21:05.380
This is who I am,

21:05.380 --> 21:07.210
and I don't care who knows it!

21:07.210 --> 21:08.750
You go, nerd-girl!

21:08.750 --> 21:11.290
My name is Psytress!

21:11.290 --> 21:15.250
And I play  Mega Mutants!

21:15.250 --> 21:18.040
ALL: Freaks of Nature unite!

21:18.040 --> 21:20.330
(ALL WHOOPING)

21:20.330 --> 21:24.120
Okay, I have no clue
what any of that
had to do with me,

21:24.120 --> 21:25.710
but it was entertaining
as heck.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.120
(PUPPY WHIMPERS)

21:31.120 --> 21:33.120
Zuri, you can whine
all you want,

21:33.120 --> 21:35.960
but we're not charging
a ten dollar cover
for Woodchuck Weekend.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.040
(PUPPY WHIMPERS)

21:39.170 --> 21:43.120
Oh! Hey there, little fella!

21:43.120 --> 21:45.580
You're awfully cute.

21:45.580 --> 21:47.380
So, we found the food thief.

21:47.380 --> 21:49.960
He's the one who's been
stealing the meat
from the mess hall.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.920
He ate
all of the Chili Surprise.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.460
The surprise
is that he's still alive.

21:55.790 --> 21:59.040
Aww, he's so sweet,

21:59.040 --> 22:02.420
but somebody's probably
missing their best friend.

22:02.420 --> 22:04.500
I know how that feels.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.330
C'mon, let's go find out
where he came from.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.250
(BARKS)

22:09.250 --> 22:12.330
Aww.

22:12.330 --> 22:16.120
(GASPS) Hank used to do that
when I would try to
leave for school.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.920
That's why I couldn't read
till I was eleven.

22:20.330 --> 22:23.710
He doesn't have any tags.
He's a stray.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.210
That's how you got
Hank, right?

22:26.210 --> 22:27.460
He was a stray?

22:27.460 --> 22:31.380
Okay, I see
what's going on here...

22:31.380 --> 22:34.000
Lou, we realize no dog
could ever replace Hank.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.040
Yeah, he was the best.
Even though he didn't like me.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.210
What are you talking about?
Hank loved you!

22:39.210 --> 22:42.210
Then why did he,
you know, try and kill me
every time I saw him?

22:43.580 --> 22:45.580
Hank always played rough
with boys!

22:45.580 --> 22:47.880
My brothers could tell you
the same thing.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.460
Well, not Billy.
Hank bit his tongue right off.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.670
So, what do you think, Lou?

22:54.670 --> 22:55.830
Do you want to keep him?

22:55.830 --> 22:58.290
He'd be the perfect
camp mascot.

22:58.290 --> 23:01.170
He's adorable
and he can tolerate the food.

23:02.540 --> 23:06.040
In that case,
welcome to Camp Kikiwaka.

23:06.040 --> 23:07.420
(ALL CHEERING)

23:08.580 --> 23:10.580
(GASPS) You're gonna
need a name.

23:10.580 --> 23:11.880
Got any ideas?

23:12.420 --> 23:14.330
(BARKS)

23:14.330 --> 23:15.880
Why's he barking
at your Woodchuck?

23:15.880 --> 23:18.880
'Cause even dogs know
hats with ear flaps
are a fashion don't.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.500
Oh, I get it.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.210
He wants to be called Chuck!

23:23.210 --> 23:24.460
Is that right, boy?

23:24.460 --> 23:26.120
(CHUCKLES)

23:26.120 --> 23:28.380
I'll take that slobber
as a yes!

23:28.380 --> 23:30.120
I'll get one of Emma's shirts.
