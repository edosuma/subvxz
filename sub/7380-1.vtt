00:45.671 --> 00:46.801
It doesn't make sense.

00:46.839 --> 00:49.469
I don't understand how something
like this happened.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.055
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.935
This has been my whole life,
and now it's gone.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.852
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

00:58.016 --> 01:01.136
Pendleton Industries is
all I've ever known.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.516
And now it's all been taken away.

01:05.399 --> 01:09.609
When someone sees a weakness in me,
I turn that weakness into a strength.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.285
Danica, you're so strong.

01:18.996 --> 01:21.786
I don't think I could do
anything like this.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.786
You can imagine changing your life...

01:24.835 --> 01:27.465
by fighting for the deed
to the land, Clarinda.

01:27.504 --> 01:31.424
Which is only possible if Bartholomew
is no longer living.

01:34.970 --> 01:37.810
You will never get
the deed to the land again.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.888
I will never allow it.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.273
Put down that gun,
you silly girl.

01:42.978 --> 01:45.228
Watch your step, Bartholomew.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.152
Ridge is on his way.

01:47.191 --> 01:49.151
And he's still in love with Clarinda.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.203
And Jared loves me.

01:52.779 --> 01:53.949
Clarinda...

01:54.615 --> 01:56.075
it's true.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.196
I'm here for you.

02:12.090 --> 02:17.600
This is the story of Joy,
as told by me, her grandmother.

02:22.809 --> 02:26.729
Everybody starts out with some
kind of dream of what life will be.

02:30.943 --> 02:34.363
Joy's dream started at this metal garage
her father ran.

02:43.247 --> 02:46.877
Jackie, Jackie, bo-backie
Banana-fana, fo-fackie

02:46.917 --> 02:48.837
Fee-fi, mo-mackie
Jackie

02:48.877 --> 02:52.547
My granddaughter had a best friend,
Jackie.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.669
Joy, Joy, bo-boy
Banana-fana, fo-foy

02:54.716 --> 02:57.506
While shivering in my shoes

02:57.553 --> 02:59.723
I strike a careless pose

02:59.763 --> 03:01.563
A half-sister, Peggy.

03:04.726 --> 03:05.726
A dog.

03:05.769 --> 03:07.769
It's okay. It's okay, Mitzy.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.445
A father.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.649
A mother...

03:15.946 --> 03:17.736
who is my daughter.

03:19.116 --> 03:22.076
A grandmother. That's me.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.220
She made many beautiful things
in her room.

03:38.260 --> 03:39.470
Magic.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.182
Some people love to make things.

03:44.349 --> 03:49.149
They have the patience and the focus
to figure it out with their hands.

03:49.188 --> 03:53.188
Joy was one of those people
who rejoiced in making things.

03:53.233 --> 03:57.243
And I open the gate
to the big green meadow.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.375
And I went into the forest.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.276
And there, I conquered many dangers.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.198
A wolf...

04:06.246 --> 04:08.536
and other scary things.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.632
And then I started to build
my very own house...

04:12.419 --> 04:13.549
where I would live...

04:13.587 --> 04:16.877
and make wonderful creations
for all the world...

04:16.923 --> 04:18.724
to see and have.

04:19.343 --> 04:20.892
And maybe for the prince and princess...

04:20.928 --> 04:23.638
who lived across the forest,
in the castle.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.680
See?

04:25.349 --> 04:27.229
And they were in love.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.887
And maybe they'd invite me over...

04:28.936 --> 04:30.806
because of the things that I made.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.645
You need a handsome prince.
That's what you need. A prince.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.654
No, I don't need a prince.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.776
This is a special power.
I don't need a prince.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.622
My daughter Terry is separated,
and alone in her room...

04:49.665 --> 04:51.505
watching soap operas.

04:51.542 --> 04:52.832
You can imagine changing your life...

04:52.876 --> 04:55.796
by fighting for the deed
to the land, Clarinda.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.053
I have something for you.

04:59.091 --> 05:00.551
Oh, Danica...

05:01.593 --> 05:02.763
You're so strong.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.223
I don't think I could ever do
something like this.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.646
I always felt it was for me
to encourage her.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.269
So I said...

05:15.816 --> 05:20.946
You are going to grow up and be a strong,
smart young woman...

05:20.988 --> 05:26.488
go to school, meet a fine young man,
have beautiful children of your own...

05:26.535 --> 05:32.215
and you're gonna build wonderful things
that you do in your room.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.079
Okay?

05:33.125 --> 05:35.595
What happened to this girl's dreams?

05:36.920 --> 05:38.210
Watch this.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.385
Mother, I can't find my lanyard for work.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.594
They're not gonna let me through
airport security without it.

05:42.634 --> 05:45.354
Joy, you can't find your lanyard?
Can I help you?

05:45.387 --> 05:46.347
No, but I...

05:46.388 --> 05:47.558
Honey, listen.

05:47.598 --> 05:51.938
I know life hasn't gone as we discussed
many times, sweetheart.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.727
And you don't exactly have
your whole life ahead of you...

05:54.771 --> 05:57.521
but you still have a good portion
of it, anyway.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.442
Hope springs eternal.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.323
- Thanks, Mimi.
- Sure.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.953
Mother, look what I did find.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.907
What is that?

06:08.952 --> 06:10.832
How can you ask what this is?

06:11.455 --> 06:14.175
The dog collar I invented
in high school.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.168
Remember Mitzy choked a couple of times?

06:16.210 --> 06:18.710
So I invented a dog collar
with a quick release...

06:18.754 --> 06:19.964
so that a dog would never choke...

06:20.005 --> 06:23.715
and I covered it with reflective tape,
plus it's a flea collar.

06:23.759 --> 06:26.589
I probably wouldn't be late to this job
I'm going to...

06:26.637 --> 06:28.347
if you'd gotten me a patent or a lawyer.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.388
Joy the doer, Joy the doer.
You were always doing things, honey.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.773
How could I be expected
to remember everything?

06:33.810 --> 06:36.650
Now the Hartz company
has the patent to that collar.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.608
I don't know how to get a patent.

06:39.483 --> 06:40.863
What is that smell?

06:41.985 --> 06:43.945
How did you get
yogurt down here, Mother?

06:45.239 --> 06:46.779
I was wondering what that odor was.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.953
It's starting to mold for Pete's sake.

06:48.992 --> 06:53.202
Yes, I am, because I feel like I cannot
have the life bled out of me this way.

06:53.247 --> 06:56.207
Joy, look who's back.
Look who's back!

06:56.250 --> 06:58.790
Yes, Bartholomew is back.

06:58.836 --> 06:59.666
No, no.

06:59.711 --> 07:00.961
I thought Bartholomew was dead?

07:01.004 --> 07:02.134
And I'm a ghost.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.172
He came back as a ghost with
even greater powers.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.376
Ghost, you go away!

07:05.425 --> 07:07.465
My powers are even greater now.

07:07.511 --> 07:09.471
I cannot handle this.
How is this possible?

07:10.138 --> 07:11.178
Stay away from him.

07:11.223 --> 07:13.143
Clarinda, you don't know
what a ghost can do to you!

07:13.183 --> 07:14.643
Even from beyond the grave.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.360
Grandma's gonna take you
to the birthday party, okay?

07:18.397 --> 07:19.397
Five minutes.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.491
Hi. What are you doing here?

07:23.527 --> 07:25.857
I'm returning him to you.
I don't want him anymore.

07:25.904 --> 07:26.954
What?

07:27.531 --> 07:28.821
He's damaged.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.326
He has no place else to go.

07:30.701 --> 07:32.701
He's been living
in my house for two years.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.794
Dad, I'm so sorry.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.420
But you know,
Tony's living in the basement.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.577
Your ex-husband shouldn't be living
in your basement.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.586
That's not the proper way to be divorced.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.838
Okay. I don't know
where I'm gonna put you.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.592
Dad, don't go in there. Mom's in there.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.389
You can have him back, Terry.
I don't want him anymore.

07:50.429 --> 07:52.179
What was so much better about
being with Sharon, Rudy?

07:52.222 --> 07:53.472
Dad, don't answer that.

07:53.515 --> 07:55.555
We went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

07:55.601 --> 07:58.191
- What did you like at the museum?
- What did I like? I'll tell you what I like.

07:58.228 --> 08:02.188
I like the ancient Roman statues.
I like the medieval armor.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.032
I like the Etruscan jewelry.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.817
- Museums are full of dust and death.
- I like going to the cafÃ©...

08:06.862 --> 08:08.992
having an espresso, a nice panini,
that's what I like.

08:09.031 --> 08:11.281
You had a panini in a coffin, Rudy.

08:11.325 --> 08:14.335
- A dusty, boring coffin. Yuck.
- Then why'd you ask me?

08:14.369 --> 08:15.539
What are you, a crazy person?

08:15.579 --> 08:17.329
It's like having a conversation
with an insane asylum person.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.832
What else, Captain Jack?
What else was so great?

08:18.874 --> 08:20.544
Captain Jack, you're calling me. Okay.

08:20.584 --> 08:21.884
Yes, you're Captain Jack,
the flying jackass.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.919
Yeah, and you know what you are?
You're like a gas leak.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.762
- We don't smell you, we don't see you...
- I am not a gas leak!

08:25.797 --> 08:27.377
- But you're killing us all silently.
- You take that back...

08:27.424 --> 08:28.554
and tell me what else you did
with Sharon!

08:28.592 --> 08:30.052
You creature from the Black Lagoon.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.683
No! This conversation is over.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.679
- I'm leaving. Good luck.
- Oh, my God. Here it goes.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.682
Watch out, Joy. He's gonna snap!

08:35.724 --> 08:37.933
Please. You want me to snap.
That's your whole routine. You...

08:37.976 --> 08:39.096
Guard the china!

08:39.144 --> 08:41.274
- Hey, Terry, you like this?
- Dad, no!

08:41.313 --> 08:42.863
How's this for snapping?

08:43.357 --> 08:44.607
- No! No.
- How's this?

08:46.151 --> 08:47.401
This is snapping!

08:47.444 --> 08:49.904
- Dad! Stop!
- He's disturbed, Joy!

08:49.947 --> 08:51.407
He's a disturbed man!

08:51.448 --> 08:53.318
- I'm disturbed?
- He's a damaged man!

08:53.367 --> 08:55.157
You're right, I am disturbed.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.622
You're the great disturber!

08:57.579 --> 08:58.709
I'm sorry, honey.

08:58.747 --> 08:59.907
I don't like this.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.667
You're not supposed to see
this kind of thing.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.958
I'm very, very sorry.
I apologize sincerely.

09:04.378 --> 09:07.128
It's not gonna happen, okay?
We have other...

09:07.798 --> 09:08.918
I'm gonna clean all this up.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.756
Dad, no. Don't clean it up.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.801
Dad, stop. Just don't, okay?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.807
Stop. I'll do it.
I just want to get you out of this room.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.059
Thank you.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.812
Hi, guys.
I'm sorry about all the yelling.

09:21.854 --> 09:24.024
Mimi's gonna take you
to the birthday party, okay?

09:24.064 --> 09:25.654
Hi, my sweethearts.

09:25.691 --> 09:27.821
- You broke things again.
- He did break stuff.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.610
I did break some things,
but Grandma was wrong.

09:29.653 --> 09:32.033
So I was a little wrong,
but she was really wrong.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.242
But Grandpa's gonna come stay with us
for a little while.

09:34.283 --> 09:35.783
Yay!

09:35.826 --> 09:38.696
A sleepover with Grandpa! Yay!

09:38.745 --> 09:42.365
Sharon never separated the wash.
The whites were always grey.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.786
But you have that magic touch, sweetheart,
so could I give this to you, please?

09:44.835 --> 09:46.845
Yeah, I'll take care of it, yeah.
Just get your bag.

09:46.879 --> 09:48.509
What about my ledgers and all that stuff?
My accounting books?

09:48.547 --> 09:49.877
I got them.
I'll get them to you later today.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.513
- I love you, Grandpa.
- Love you.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.050
- I did your taxes, I did your W-2s.
- Okay. Very important.

10:08.984 --> 10:10.194
You suck!

10:10.736 --> 10:11.896
What is he doing here?

10:11.945 --> 10:13.145
Sharon brought him back...

10:13.197 --> 10:17.327
so he's gonna stay with us until he finds
a new love or a new place to live.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.617
You know how this goes.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.169
Dad, up.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.966
This is not the proper way to be divorced,
the two of you.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.610
You're gonna tell me how to be divorced?

10:36.637 --> 10:39.177
I'm a provider, Tom Jones.
I have my own business.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.853
I help Joy with the mortgage.
What do you do?

10:40.891 --> 10:43.141
You sing all night
at Angela Starpoli's club.

10:43.185 --> 10:45.405
You get repeatedly fired
from Campbell's Soup.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.517
Okay, well I'm gonna divide
the basement.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.444
I'm divorced.
I can do whatever I want, Rudy.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.983
This is not the proper way to be divorced.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.776
And I'm about to be late for work.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.489
So please try not to fight
in front of the children, okay?

10:55.531 --> 10:56.741
Especially not physically.

10:56.782 --> 10:59.242
Rudy, you see this?
This microphone here?

10:59.868 --> 11:02.498
You touch it, and I kill you.

11:04.831 --> 11:05.961
Okay. I'm leaving.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.209
Please try not to kill each other
while I'm gone.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.422
You've gone mad. This is all your fault!

11:10.462 --> 11:12.382
Clarinda. Clarinda! Don't.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.222
Clarinda, something terrible happened!
Stay away from him!

11:19.054 --> 11:21.814
Oh, my God.
I thought I fixed this thing.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.889
Nice job, Joy. Nice job.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.904
Peggy? What are you doing here?

11:27.771 --> 11:30.532
What's the matter with you?
Sending Grandma Mimi with her arthritis...

11:30.566 --> 11:32.316
to take them to their friend's birthday?

11:32.359 --> 11:33.649
I'm fine.

11:33.694 --> 11:36.784
They have a much better time
with me anyway, with Aunt Peggy.

11:37.739 --> 11:41.199
But I wasn't stupid enough to get into
a bad marriage and have a couple of kids.

11:41.243 --> 11:42.543
Don't bother your sister, Peggy.

11:42.578 --> 11:45.158
I'm gonna talk to Dad about business.
All right?

11:45.205 --> 11:46.915
You gonna come bring the books
by the garage later?

11:46.957 --> 11:48.577
Yeah, I'm gonna bring them later.
He's in the basement.

11:48.625 --> 11:49.745
I'm joking with you.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.043
Yeah. I know.

11:51.086 --> 11:53.376
Kids, we're gonna do
something fun later, okay?

11:53.422 --> 11:55.092
We're doing something fun now.

12:01.722 --> 12:04.272
Oh, we found your luggage
but it's in Cleveland.

12:04.308 --> 12:06.058
So now we just need to get it back
to New York City.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.231
I'm filing a complaint.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.228
My husband needs his medication.

12:10.606 --> 12:12.356
What's your name? Joy?

12:12.399 --> 12:14.279
You don't seem joyous to me today.

12:14.318 --> 12:16.238
Perhaps I am not so joyous today.

12:16.278 --> 12:18.148
- Joy, I think you're getting demoted.
- Hi, how you doing?

12:18.197 --> 12:20.197
Listen, I need you to speak
to the supervisor.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.950
We're gonna be having some changes,
and you're gonna be going to the night hours.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.914
- Night hours? Tom, I can't work night hours.
- And we're having cutbacks.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.584
- I've got two kids.
- Joy, I'm sorry.

12:27.623 --> 12:28.673
Good luck.

12:28.707 --> 12:29.707
Bye, Susan.

12:50.312 --> 12:52.772
I'm not paying for metal
that I haven't gotten.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.824
On top of me send...
You know, he wants to get paid.

12:54.858 --> 12:57.398
He doesn't send an invoice,
and he hasn't even sent the metal.

12:58.153 --> 13:01.113
But why doesn't he just send the invoice?
Send the invoice, I'll pay him.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.615
Yep. That's it. Send the invoice.

13:05.536 --> 13:08.286
Hi. Dad, I want to thank you again
for helping with the mortgage.

13:08.330 --> 13:09.290
Yeah.

13:09.331 --> 13:12.461
I settled the accounts, balanced the books.

13:12.501 --> 13:13.211
Thank you.

13:13.252 --> 13:15.002
I'm sorry business is so bad, Dad.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.545
I don't think that
that crazy gun range is helping.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.631
How is that still legal?

13:19.675 --> 13:21.555
- What can I do?
- After all these years?

13:21.593 --> 13:23.353
They keep to themselves.

13:23.387 --> 13:25.427
It's their property.
The police leave them alone.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.312
Why? You think it's costing us business?

13:27.349 --> 13:28.679
I don't think it's helping.

13:29.685 --> 13:32.195
Well, if you wanna help, why don't you
come here and manage this place?

13:32.229 --> 13:35.019
You know, I'd like to go the next level.
Put on a nice suit.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.025
You know, go out there
and get some accounts.

13:38.652 --> 13:43.112
Yeah, this is 9873.
Just checking my mailbox.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.316
What is that?

13:44.366 --> 13:45.606
Yeah, I have a pen. What is it?

13:45.742 --> 13:48.162
13-14. That's it?

13:48.412 --> 13:49.702
Thank you.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.246
What was that?

13:51.290 --> 13:53.540
It's a 900 number.

13:53.584 --> 13:54.834
What's a 900 number?

13:55.460 --> 13:59.210
It's, you know, a dating service
for widows and widowers.

13:59.256 --> 14:00.546
Dating service?

14:00.591 --> 14:01.971
You're not a widow or a widower.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.389
What's the difference? I'm single.

14:03.427 --> 14:06.387
I meet nice ladies.
Maybe we fall in love.

14:06.430 --> 14:09.020
I have to fall in love or I'm not interested.
You know me.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.057
I know, Dad.

14:11.101 --> 14:14.021
Sharon was no good for him.
It's nice for him to meet somebody new.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.192
- I got him some new clothes, you know?
- Okay. Okay.

14:16.231 --> 14:17.821
- Hello? Is this 7633?
- It's good., THEN JOY TO PEGGY

14:17.858 --> 14:19.978
- Okay. I love you. See you later.
- Yes?

14:20.027 --> 14:20.897
Bye.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.704
Hi. This is 9833.

14:23.614 --> 14:25.414
Hi! Hi, how are you?

14:25.449 --> 14:26.869
What a nice voice you have.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.409
Thank you.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.747
- Oh, an accent.
- Yes.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.157
I am from Italy.

14:32.206 --> 14:33.786
Oh! Continental.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.749
What is your name?

14:35.792 --> 14:37.592
My name is Rudy, what's yours?

14:37.628 --> 14:38.628
Trudy.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.842
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.091
Your name is Trudy?

14:42.132 --> 14:43.092
Yes!

14:43.133 --> 14:44.473
Rudy and Trudy. I love it.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.475
Let's figure out when we're gonna meet.

14:47.513 --> 14:49.563
That's a good idea. Let's have dinner.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.313
- I could come pick you up.
- Yeah.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.850
I have a green Mercedes.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.023
Okay, 6:30? I'll be ready.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.062
Ciao.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.772
Good luck with your date, Dad.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.185
Thank you. I'm excited.

15:00.234 --> 15:01.744
What do you think you're gonna wear?

15:03.195 --> 15:05.455
Polo by Ralph Lauren.

15:05.489 --> 15:07.489
Did you have to use
the whole bottle of cologne?

15:07.533 --> 15:08.203
Tony!

15:08.242 --> 15:10.162
You smell like my grandmother.
He smells like my grandmother.

15:10.202 --> 15:12.002
Hey, please. Don't make me tense.

15:12.037 --> 15:15.207
Don't stress me out.
I gotta stay nice and loose.

15:15.249 --> 15:16.959
- Now you're tense?
- I'm tense. You're making me tense.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.250
- Guys, stop. Please.
- I'm making you tense?

15:19.795 --> 15:21.005
My carriage awaits.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.456
Have a great date.

15:22.506 --> 15:23.626
Wish me luck.

15:23.674 --> 15:24.764
You don't need it.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.427
Joy, water!

15:27.469 --> 15:28.599
Where are my cufflinks?

15:28.637 --> 15:30.467
Mommy, come read to me!

15:30.514 --> 15:31.644
Five minutes, Cristy.

15:31.682 --> 15:32.892
Mother, again?

15:34.142 --> 15:36.482
Yeah, you just sit right there.
Are you comfortable?

15:36.854 --> 15:42.284
How many times do I have to tell you
not to clean your brushes out in the sink!

15:42.317 --> 15:44.817
Danica thinks it's unladylike
to toss things in the toilet.

15:44.862 --> 15:46.152
And I happen to agree.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.616
Yeah? Well, why don't you have
Danica do your plumbing then?

15:48.657 --> 15:52.367
Danica can direct her power
anywhere Danica chooses.

15:52.411 --> 15:54.831
That is the power of Danica.

15:57.499 --> 15:58.829
Oh, my God.

15:58.876 --> 16:01.166
If this problem gets any worse...

16:02.212 --> 16:04.552
we're gonna have to move you
into a different room.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.050
That means no TV.

16:06.717 --> 16:08.427
That could be very scary for you.

16:09.428 --> 16:12.308
Don't let that happen, Joy.
This is my comfort nest.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.428
We're gonna need to get
a plumber in here.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.555
What?

16:17.311 --> 16:20.151
There's gonna... A man in my room?

16:20.189 --> 16:22.519
Well, I don't know any female plumbers
other than me.

16:22.566 --> 16:24.106
Well, can't you fix it, Joy?

16:24.151 --> 16:26.701
This has surpassed my capabilities.

16:26.737 --> 16:27.857
Thanks, Joy.

16:28.739 --> 16:31.829
"The cicada is a large flying insect
two to three inches long.

16:31.867 --> 16:35.407
"It makes a sound of up to 120 decibels,
louder than some telephones.

16:36.246 --> 16:39.956
"It lives half of its life above ground
evading predators.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.710
This is the book you wanted me
to read to you, Cristy?

16:41.752 --> 16:43.352
How did this book even get in the house?

16:43.754 --> 16:45.384
Aunt Peggy got it for me.

16:45.422 --> 16:49.932
She said the reason I like cicadas
is because they fill the air with sound...

16:49.968 --> 16:52.098
which makes the house less lonelier for me.

16:52.763 --> 16:56.223
Aunt Peggy tells you how you feel
about the house being lonely?

16:56.266 --> 16:57.886
Aunt Peggy tells me a lot of things.

16:57.935 --> 16:59.315
Keep reading, please.

17:00.812 --> 17:03.402
I don't want you
listening to Aunt Peggy too much.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.819
Okay. Why?

17:06.068 --> 17:08.608
"The cicada,
a symbol of rebirth in many countries...

17:08.654 --> 17:12.324
"digs into the ground and stays buried
for up to 17 years."

17:12.950 --> 17:16.040
That's such a random number.
Why 17 years?

17:16.828 --> 17:18.078
It doesn't even say why.

17:18.121 --> 17:21.251
I understand the four seasons in a year...

17:21.290 --> 17:23.840
but why would something
stay hidden for 17 years?

17:23.877 --> 17:26.757
That's just unsettling.
I'm not reading this.

17:26.797 --> 17:28.797
You're sleepy anyway.
We gotta go to bed.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.932
I wanna sleep with Nana.

17:31.969 --> 17:33.599
No, you should sleep upstairs
in your room.

17:33.637 --> 17:35.177
I want Nana.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.937
All right. Well, watch out.
There's a hole here.

17:45.274 --> 17:47.114
Just going to lay down for a second.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.451
I feel like I'm in a prison.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.158
No, Bartholomew's the ex-con
in the story.

17:54.199 --> 17:56.329
And Clarinda doesn't even know about it.

17:56.368 --> 17:57.988
But Danica's onto him.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.962
They all blame Clarinda
but Danica's gonna get to the bottom of it.

18:01.999 --> 18:03.209
No. No.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.790
Yes. It was you Clarinda.

18:05.836 --> 18:07.246
I will get to the bottom of this.

18:07.296 --> 18:09.006
You've made terrible mistakes.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.417
It was Clarinda!

18:13.177 --> 18:14.337
Oh.

18:14.386 --> 18:15.466
Look who's here.

18:15.512 --> 18:16.682
Look who's here.

18:17.014 --> 18:18.064
Look who's here.

18:39.244 --> 18:42.504
We are here today
to remember what was lost...

18:42.539 --> 18:44.959
seventeen years ago.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.040
Do you remember?

18:49.379 --> 18:50.759
Peggy comes with me.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.837
Joy spends half the time with us.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.180
We'll take her paper forest.

18:55.219 --> 18:57.509
That's Joy's special thing,
and it belongs in this house.

18:57.554 --> 18:58.644
No, I...

19:10.943 --> 19:11.943
Joy.

19:13.862 --> 19:14.952
Joy, wake up!

19:15.614 --> 19:17.414
Someone's been ringing the doorbell.

19:31.421 --> 19:32.631
Jackie!

19:33.090 --> 19:34.260
Oh, thank God! It's you.

19:34.299 --> 19:37.799
What happened? I'm worried about you.
I don't see you any more.

19:37.845 --> 19:39.605
You don't come to the PTA.

19:40.013 --> 19:44.143
You know how my mom's always clogging
the sink with her hair from the brushes?

19:44.184 --> 19:45.564
With the pipes in her room?

19:45.602 --> 19:47.562
Yeah. She did it again.

19:47.604 --> 19:48.404
Again?

19:48.438 --> 19:50.818
Yes, and I had to
bash open a hole in the floor.

19:50.858 --> 19:54.738
There's a huge hole in the floor
of my mother's room and I'm broke.

19:56.280 --> 19:59.990
My father works hard.
He's had some bad breaks.

20:02.494 --> 20:05.874
I hope he gets another girlfriend,
and he'll move out of the basement.

20:06.290 --> 20:07.830
He's in the basement with Tony?

20:07.875 --> 20:10.545
Yes. And they hate each other.

20:11.170 --> 20:12.500
Yes.

20:13.297 --> 20:15.837
It's a disaster.
They won't stop fighting.

20:17.551 --> 20:18.551
I don't know.

20:19.511 --> 20:22.641
But how are you?
How's the family? How is everybody?

20:22.681 --> 20:23.771
Everybody's okay.

20:23.807 --> 20:25.017
How's work?

20:25.642 --> 20:27.982
My job, I could take it or leave it.

20:28.812 --> 20:31.112
What happened to us, Jackie?

20:31.148 --> 20:33.778
All the things
that we used to dream about.

20:33.817 --> 20:36.947
I feel like they just keep getting
farther and farther away.

20:36.987 --> 20:39.907
Remember the night of the party
where everything started?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.830
The band was playing.

20:42.284 --> 20:43.914
Everything was so exciting.

20:45.829 --> 20:47.499
Joy, you came!

20:47.539 --> 20:50.249
I'm so glad you came!
This is my boyfriend, Andre.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.632
- Hi, Andre.
- Nice to meet you.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.378
Andre, this is my childhood friend, Joy.

20:53.879 --> 20:55.009
Come inside!

20:56.089 --> 20:57.629
- Wow.
- Check my music class, accountant girl.

20:57.674 --> 20:58.934
This is a class?

20:58.967 --> 20:59.967
Yes!

21:00.010 --> 21:02.890
Don't turn on the lights
'cause I don't wanna see

21:02.930 --> 21:05.350
Mama told me not to come

21:05.390 --> 21:07.520
- They're so good!
- They are! The teacher's band.

21:07.559 --> 21:08.979
Mama told me not to come

21:09.019 --> 21:10.479
Mama told me not to come

21:10.521 --> 21:15.151
She said,
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"

21:15.192 --> 21:16.942
"That ain't the way to have fun"

21:18.028 --> 21:20.358
Mama told me not to come

21:21.823 --> 21:24.243
Mama told me not to come

21:24.952 --> 21:27.412
- Who's the bald guy?
- That's our music teacher.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.624
And he has all this...
This is his house?

21:29.665 --> 21:31.125
- Yeah, this is his house.
- Wow.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.536
He's from Venezuela.

21:32.584 --> 21:35.304
- Who is that guy?
- Yeah.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.377
That's the music teacher's son.

21:38.048 --> 21:39.588
Oh, my gosh.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.218
You're dancing. Here you go.

21:49.268 --> 21:50.388
What am I doing now?

21:50.435 --> 21:51.685
- You're dancing.
- No.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.228
- Let me show you my father's house.
- What?

21:53.272 --> 21:54.522
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:54.565 --> 21:56.115
I'm gonna be a singer.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.440
Really?

21:57.484 --> 22:00.204
Yeah. I'm gonna be
the next Tom Jones.

22:00.237 --> 22:03.527
That's a big ambition.
There's only one Tom Jones.

22:03.574 --> 22:07.084
I know, but you can't let the practical
get you down.

22:07.911 --> 22:10.161
You gotta keep going to what you love.

22:10.914 --> 22:12.214
That's true.

22:12.249 --> 22:13.879
That's what my father taught me.

22:17.212 --> 22:18.592
What about you?

22:20.549 --> 22:26.849
I invented a dog collar that I want to get patented,
but I don't think it ever will.

22:28.515 --> 22:31.635
I was valedictorian in high school.

22:33.312 --> 22:36.362
I got into a college in Boston...

22:36.398 --> 22:39.568
but I'm staying here
because my parents are getting divorced...

22:39.610 --> 22:41.900
and I'm staying to help my mom.

22:41.945 --> 22:45.735
And I help my dad with business stuff.
Accountant.

22:46.950 --> 22:49.580
Maybe your dreams are on hold right now.

22:49.953 --> 22:51.043
No?

22:51.705 --> 22:53.785
That's a nice way of putting it.

22:54.917 --> 22:56.917
This song is going to be
in the town musical.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.630
We should sing it together.

22:58.879 --> 23:02.549
I know I stand in line
Until you think you have the time

23:02.591 --> 23:05.511
To spend an evening with me

23:06.637 --> 23:07.927
That's really nice.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.221
Okay, go.

23:09.264 --> 23:10.604
- No.
- Okay.

23:10.641 --> 23:12.931
And if we go someplace to dance

23:12.976 --> 23:15.976
I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me

23:16.021 --> 23:18.771
He gave my girl a spring in her step,
just when she needed it.

23:18.815 --> 23:20.975
What are we doing? Tony.

23:21.318 --> 23:24.648
He got her to do the musical,
something she never would have done.

23:35.457 --> 23:39.417
I know I stand in line
Until you think you have the time

23:39.461 --> 23:42.761
To spend an evening with me

23:44.842 --> 23:48.762
And if we go someplace to dance
I know that there's a chance

23:48.804 --> 23:52.144
You won't be leaving with me

23:54.017 --> 24:01.017
and afterwards we drop into a
quiet little place and have a drink or two

24:03.277 --> 24:10.277
And then I go and spoil it all by
saying something stupid like "I love you"

24:12.202 --> 24:16.412
I can see it in your eyes
That you despise the same old lies

24:16.456 --> 24:19.706
You heard the night before

24:20.794 --> 24:24.134
You're so smart, you're so beautiful,
I... I just...

24:25.382 --> 24:26.552
You could have married anybody.

24:26.592 --> 24:29.052
You could have married a doctor, a lawyer,
a nice man instead of this...

24:29.094 --> 24:30.604
I don't even know what to call this guy.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.477
Are you seriously talking
about this right now?

24:36.727 --> 24:38.557
It's still not too late.

24:38.604 --> 24:39.604
Dad.

24:40.355 --> 24:41.725
Let's go.

24:44.193 --> 24:45.323
Think about it.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.360
Dad!

25:06.006 --> 25:09.046
We are a loving family, a solid family.

25:09.092 --> 25:10.512
I've been married to my wife...

25:10.552 --> 25:11.852
Now I have a speech.

25:11.887 --> 25:13.427
He wasn't finished, Dad.

25:13.472 --> 25:14.932
He's finished now.

25:15.307 --> 25:17.227
I had two failed marriages.

25:17.893 --> 25:20.733
The daughter from my first marriage,
Peggy...

25:20.771 --> 25:23.941
has a lot of tension with the daughter
from my second marriage, Joy.

25:25.317 --> 25:30.657
I was married to Joy's mother
for 18 miserable fucking years.

25:30.989 --> 25:32.989
Dad! That's just mean! Sit down!

25:33.033 --> 25:34.373
But I got out of all that.

25:34.743 --> 25:37.623
And I finally met the light of my life,
Sharon.

25:38.205 --> 25:39.415
- To you, baby.
- Dad!

25:39.456 --> 25:40.666
You're my guy.

25:40.707 --> 25:41.707
I toast you.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.250
Dad! Stop!

25:43.293 --> 25:45.253
- Will you stop it?
- Rudolph, please! Enough.

25:45.295 --> 25:48.125
- Are you happy now?
- Fairly happy, yes.

25:48.382 --> 25:49.882
Look what I found.

25:51.093 --> 25:52.183
The divorce glass.

25:52.761 --> 25:53.891
Salud.

25:53.929 --> 25:56.259
I give these kids 50-50 odds.

25:57.015 --> 25:59.765
Salud, everybody. Have a good time.

26:00.102 --> 26:01.982
Tony, wake up!

26:02.020 --> 26:05.360
Please! Cristy hasn't eaten,
Tommy needs to be changed.

26:06.066 --> 26:09.066
Oh, Cristy. What are you doing?

26:09.361 --> 26:11.741
- Get up. I just told your boss you're going to work!
- But what did you lie for?

26:11.780 --> 26:13.950
- Because you're gonna lose another job!
- No, honey, I'm sick!

26:13.991 --> 26:15.871
You're not sick, you're hungover!

26:16.118 --> 26:18.498
That's not who I am!
I'm a singer, that's what I do!

26:18.537 --> 26:20.077
You're not making any money singing!

26:20.122 --> 26:22.002
Get in your car right now
and go get your job!

26:22.040 --> 26:24.000
You're trying to turn me
into someone I'm not!

26:24.042 --> 26:26.502
I can't do this!
I can't do this, Tony!

26:26.545 --> 26:28.055
I am losing my mind!

26:34.344 --> 26:36.304
I don't wanna end up like my family.

26:59.369 --> 27:00.749
Time moves forward.

27:01.371 --> 27:03.251
Time moves backwards.

27:03.290 --> 27:04.290
Time stands still.

27:17.596 --> 27:19.636
Do I live up to my profile
or do I fall short?

27:19.681 --> 27:22.891
Are you kidding?
You're a banana flambÃ© with extra rum.

27:23.894 --> 27:26.154
You're a trip to the moon
on gossamer wings.

27:26.188 --> 27:29.478
Wow! You're so poetic and romantic.

27:29.525 --> 27:30.485
It's true!

27:30.526 --> 27:32.356
Just like my late Morris.

27:32.402 --> 27:36.572
Morris. Now, he was American and you're Italian,
and your name originated how?

27:36.615 --> 27:38.955
My name. My Italian name is Geltrude.

27:38.992 --> 27:39.832
Geltrude.

27:39.868 --> 27:43.498
And then he called me "Trude,"
and then became more American. "Trudy."

27:43.997 --> 27:44.827
Trudy.

27:44.873 --> 27:49.383
Why don't you come with your entire family,
on my late Morris' boat?

27:50.254 --> 27:52.214
Bring the children,
bring the grandchildren.

27:52.256 --> 27:53.716
Like a motorboat?

27:53.757 --> 27:55.547
No, no, it's a sailboat. 55 feet.

27:55.592 --> 27:57.722
- Wow. That's big. That is big.
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:57.761 --> 27:59.051
Yeah, I would love to.

27:59.096 --> 28:01.176
We'd bring some nice food,
something to drink, that would be great.

28:01.223 --> 28:06.233
Yeah, but not red wine,
because it might stain the teakwood deck.

28:06.270 --> 28:07.520
It's very precious.

28:07.563 --> 28:09.273
Okay, understood. No red wine.

28:09.523 --> 28:11.403
I got the red wine!

28:11.441 --> 28:13.571
No, no, no, I'm sorry,
you can't have red wine on the boat.

28:13.610 --> 28:15.740
No red wine, Tony. No red wine.

28:15.779 --> 28:17.489
Why? It's a beautiful wine!

28:17.531 --> 28:19.821
What's Tom Jones doing here anyway?
Who invited him?

28:19.867 --> 28:21.277
He's here to help me with the kids.

28:21.702 --> 28:23.292
I brought Peggy to help.

28:23.328 --> 28:25.038
Peggy says mean things
about me to my children, so...

28:25.080 --> 28:26.540
I say nice things about you, too.

28:26.582 --> 28:27.712
It's a beautiful wine.

28:27.749 --> 28:28.829
You have an accent, too!

28:28.876 --> 28:29.826
Yes.

28:29.877 --> 28:31.287
Where are you from, paesano?

28:31.336 --> 28:33.706
Paesano? Don't encourage him, please.

28:33.755 --> 28:35.005
I'm from Venezuela, darling.

28:35.048 --> 28:36.088
Do you know this song?

28:50.814 --> 28:53.114
I can see why she still loves him!

28:53.150 --> 28:54.570
Come on. Come on board.

28:54.610 --> 28:57.400
- This is gonna be a disaster.
- Dad.

28:58.530 --> 28:59.530
Cheers!

29:00.282 --> 29:03.332
I dressed for boating but I didn't realize
how cold it was gonna be.

29:03.368 --> 29:08.578
My late husband Morris, I met him in Milano
for a trade show for his swimwear line.

29:08.624 --> 29:11.544
He used to say, "Sailing in the winter...

29:11.585 --> 29:15.095
"is the best comparison
to life in the world of commerce."

29:31.146 --> 29:32.146
Oh, no!

29:32.606 --> 29:35.316
Morris' teakwood deck!

29:35.359 --> 29:37.029
Yeah. Grand adventure. Great.

29:37.069 --> 29:38.699
Nice work, Tom Jones.

29:39.446 --> 29:44.616
Trudy, I know that it's upsetting,
but wouldn't Morris say, "What a grand adventure?"

29:44.660 --> 29:47.870
Yeah, you're right. No big deal.
He's probably laughing up in heaven.

29:47.913 --> 29:49.583
We should have used paper cups.

29:50.123 --> 29:51.333
No, but it's not the same thing.

29:51.375 --> 29:53.675
You need a nice glass
for a beautiful wine, you know?

29:59.383 --> 30:00.383
Oh, boy.

30:00.801 --> 30:03.601
Look. It's a piece of glass
right in her hand.

30:07.015 --> 30:09.055
Are you all right, honey?

30:09.101 --> 30:11.311
Yeah, she's thinking of something, Tony.

30:11.353 --> 30:14.863
One loop. One continuous thing.

30:14.898 --> 30:17.978
She's talking to herself. It's strange.

30:18.026 --> 30:19.396
Honey, you should go to bed.

30:20.195 --> 30:24.115
If it was all one continuous loop. Yeah.

30:26.076 --> 30:27.576
Hi, I'm Touissant.

30:27.619 --> 30:29.499
Touissant? Who's this guy?

30:30.455 --> 30:31.575
It's not for me. Is it for you?

30:31.623 --> 30:32.753
No, it's not for me, man.

30:32.791 --> 30:34.041
The plumber.

30:34.084 --> 30:35.344
What's he here for?

30:35.377 --> 30:37.047
What do you think? Terry.

30:37.588 --> 30:38.838
Terry. Oh, Terry.

30:39.173 --> 30:42.383
Oh, no, wait. What's going on?
What is this man doing in my room?

30:42.718 --> 30:43.718
This is...

30:44.052 --> 30:45.722
- Touissant.
- Touissant.

30:46.597 --> 30:48.007
Terry, Touissant.

30:48.307 --> 30:51.307
Well, I mean, I've taped my show...

30:51.351 --> 30:54.521
and then, well,
exactly how long is this going to take?

30:55.230 --> 30:57.570
Well, it shouldn't take more than a day.

30:57.608 --> 31:00.108
What accent is that, Joy?

31:00.152 --> 31:01.702
What country is that from?

31:01.737 --> 31:03.407
- Haiti.
- Haiti.

31:03.447 --> 31:04.607
Haiti?

31:04.656 --> 31:06.116
It's French and Creole.

31:07.117 --> 31:08.657
French and Creole.

31:08.702 --> 31:11.502
Well, is there any way...
Could you please put a curtain up here...

31:11.538 --> 31:14.708
so that I can come and go in my room
and watch my show while he's still working?

31:14.750 --> 31:16.460
Of course. I have a stapler.

31:16.919 --> 31:18.039
Thank you, sir.

31:18.086 --> 31:19.746
You're welcome, mademoiselle.

31:19.796 --> 31:20.916
Mademoiselle?

31:23.467 --> 31:26.337
Good luck in here
and good luck with the... that.

31:27.262 --> 31:28.642
Why don't you go to bed?

31:30.015 --> 31:31.975
Keep going up the stairs.
Go to bed.

31:32.351 --> 31:35.271
I don't want to go to sleep.
I don't want to have that horrible dream.

31:35.312 --> 31:38.692
Come on! You can't have the same dream twice.
It never happens.

31:38.732 --> 31:41.072
- It's impossible.
- That's not true.

31:41.109 --> 31:43.529
I had the Peggy dream so many times
when I was younger...

31:43.570 --> 31:44.950
with the masks and the robe.

31:44.988 --> 31:46.528
It doesn't make sense. No, no.

31:46.573 --> 31:49.083
You can't have the same dream twice.
Maybe it's the...

31:49.117 --> 31:50.487
Rudy, she's thinking about something.

31:50.536 --> 31:53.156
Maybe it's a good dream,
and she's working something out.

31:53.205 --> 31:56.715
I don't wanna work anything out.
I just want a nice, dumb sleep.

31:56.750 --> 31:59.340
Let's knock her out.
Give her a children's cough medicine.

31:59.378 --> 32:00.798
- That's what does it.
- Is that safe?

32:00.838 --> 32:02.168
No. It's not safe.

32:02.214 --> 32:03.304
It's expired.

32:04.216 --> 32:06.966
Go on, there. Knock it back, honey.

32:07.010 --> 32:09.100
- No.
- Okay, one more. Knock it down. Come on.

32:09.137 --> 32:10.887
- Rudy!
- Do it, Tony.

32:10.931 --> 32:12.601
- I don't know.
- Just do it. One more.

32:12.641 --> 32:13.641
Okay, one more.

32:13.684 --> 32:16.194
Enough with this! That's it.
I'm gonna make her a hot toddy.

32:16.228 --> 32:17.478
That's what she needs.

32:17.521 --> 32:18.691
You're gonna intoxicate her.

32:18.730 --> 32:21.570
It's all natural, it's all herbal.
Nothing strong.

32:21.608 --> 32:27.858
I was kidnapped by another monk,
who was from Switzerland.

32:29.533 --> 32:36.373
And it turned out that this monk
was a duke of a royal family.

32:37.541 --> 32:40.791
I shouldn't say "was,"
because he still is.

32:41.170 --> 32:42.670
Leave me alone.

32:43.672 --> 32:45.712
I don't think we should let her
sleep on the stairs.

32:46.133 --> 32:48.553
Let's just put it here in the couch, okay?

33:01.648 --> 33:03.818
Seventeen years.

33:03.859 --> 33:06.609
Think about it. We've been hiding...

33:06.653 --> 33:09.413
for seventeen years.

33:10.574 --> 33:12.664
Seventeen years.

33:13.118 --> 33:16.578
We used to make things.
Seventeen years ago.

33:17.039 --> 33:19.419
Then, that all stopped.
What happened?

33:21.251 --> 33:24.341
When you're hiding, you're safe...

33:24.755 --> 33:27.475
because people can't see you.

33:27.841 --> 33:30.761
But, funny thing about hiding...

33:31.178 --> 33:33.558
you're even hidden from yourself.

33:46.944 --> 33:48.614
Baby, what's the matter?

33:49.821 --> 33:51.951
Tony, you need to move out
of the basement.

33:51.990 --> 33:53.700
You need to get your own house.

33:53.742 --> 33:55.202
What? Why?

33:55.786 --> 33:58.406
Because I go out at night
and sing at Angela's club?

33:58.455 --> 33:59.705
- Is that it?
- No.

33:59.748 --> 34:02.168
Because we've been divorced
for two years.

34:02.209 --> 34:03.839
We need to move on.

34:03.877 --> 34:05.167
You need to move out.

34:06.046 --> 34:07.836
Rudy, you need to move out, too.

34:07.881 --> 34:08.801
What?

34:08.841 --> 34:10.971
There's more room in the basement
for me now.

34:11.635 --> 34:12.725
And another thing, Rudy.

34:12.761 --> 34:15.221
Tomorrow, I would like to have a meeting
with you and Trudy at your office...

34:15.264 --> 34:18.813
to discuss her investing
in the manufacturing of my new idea.

34:19.226 --> 34:20.226
No.

34:20.268 --> 34:22.228
I'm still getting to know her
and falling in love.

34:22.271 --> 34:24.481
I can't do that. I won't do that.

34:24.982 --> 34:27.362
And what manufacturing idea?
What are you talking about?

34:28.819 --> 34:32.159
I have always been there for you,
no matter what.

34:32.531 --> 34:33.911
I didn't go away to school.

34:33.949 --> 34:36.789
I stayed to help you and Mom
through the divorce and do your accounting.

34:37.034 --> 34:39.364
I let you live here whenever you want...

34:39.788 --> 34:41.618
no matter what it is.

34:42.373 --> 34:46.844
I am respectfully asking
for the favor that you owe me.

34:48.172 --> 34:50.972
If you look into your heart,
you'll know that I'm right.

34:55.596 --> 35:00.766
Cristy, I need to use your crayons,
your colored pencils and your paper.

35:01.518 --> 35:03.018
Let's go to my room.

35:39.014 --> 35:40.224
You're not gonna believe this.

35:40.265 --> 35:42.515
So, you know that plumber
that you recommended?

35:42.559 --> 35:43.729
Yeah, Touissant.

35:43.769 --> 35:47.519
So I hire him, Terry freaks out,
completely disoriented.

35:47.564 --> 35:50.194
Hasn't had a man in her room
for eight years, since Rudy.

35:50.234 --> 35:52.034
Makes me hang a drop cloth.

35:52.069 --> 35:53.239
The way I look at it...

35:53.278 --> 35:56.568
is that this is an opportunity
for you to invest in a new business...

35:58.408 --> 36:00.238
...that'll mean more money for you.

36:01.828 --> 36:03.618
Tell Rico, Dad. Number five's gotta go off.

36:03.664 --> 36:06.584
Rico, number five, no, off.

36:06.625 --> 36:08.885
Go off! Thank you!

36:09.962 --> 36:12.382
It's a standard handle, 53 inches.

36:12.422 --> 36:14.552
The sleeve connects to the mop head.

36:14.591 --> 36:16.761
Now, this is where it gets complicated.

36:17.094 --> 36:20.184
There's a clip
that connects the sleeve to the...

36:20.764 --> 36:23.274
I don't even know what to call it.
The "cup."

36:23.767 --> 36:25.307
Which is connected to the mop head.

36:25.644 --> 36:29.064
So, when you pull up on the sleeve,
the mop head stretches...

36:29.106 --> 36:31.646
so you can wring it
without ever touching it with your hands.

36:32.109 --> 36:35.319
The only thing we see
is this crayon drawings.

36:35.362 --> 36:36.742
We can't make heads or tails.

36:37.322 --> 36:38.742
We don't know what it is.

36:39.366 --> 36:42.616
So, the mop doesn't hang loose, like hair?
Like a string?

36:42.661 --> 36:44.911
It hangs, but not on loose,
open ends like hair.

36:44.955 --> 36:46.755
It's one continuous loop.

36:46.790 --> 36:47.870
- I don't get it.
- I don't get it.

36:47.916 --> 36:50.416
- I don't get it. What's he doing here?
- What's he doing here?

36:50.460 --> 36:53.630
He is the father of our children,
and my friend, and he looks out for me.

37:01.471 --> 37:03.471
We're doing an invention.

37:03.891 --> 37:05.021
Cheers.

37:05.517 --> 37:06.687
Right.

37:08.770 --> 37:10.610
Yes we are, Cristy.

37:11.398 --> 37:13.148
It's very serious.

37:13.817 --> 37:15.437
It's priority.

37:15.485 --> 37:16.945
Yes it is.

37:16.987 --> 37:17.857
And I'm helping.

37:17.905 --> 37:19.575
Yes you are.

37:29.541 --> 37:31.751
Ãa se fait comme Ã§a in Haiti.

37:31.793 --> 37:34.003
Touissant is teaching me
how to speak French.

37:34.630 --> 37:36.550
And the word for "industrious" is...

37:38.258 --> 37:39.338
Yes.

37:39.384 --> 37:41.304
At first I thought maybe
something scary would happen...

37:41.345 --> 37:45.395
like what happened with Danica
while she was kidnapped by a man...

37:45.432 --> 37:48.142
who turned out to be in hiding
from the royal family in Switzerland...

37:48.185 --> 37:50.565
and then she moved to Switzerland.

37:50.604 --> 37:52.774
Of course, she befriended that man
and more.

37:53.232 --> 37:55.322
Don't ever try and limit me, Joy.

37:55.359 --> 37:57.439
And let me know if you want some
of this Chakalaka.

37:57.486 --> 37:58.606
Chaka. Say "chaka."

37:58.654 --> 37:59.454
Chaka.

37:59.488 --> 38:00.488
It's very good.

38:08.413 --> 38:10.173
Hey, Rocky. Hey, Tom!

38:11.875 --> 38:13.205
Take her inside the office.

38:14.211 --> 38:16.711
- Hey, Tino.
- Hey, Joy.

38:16.755 --> 38:18.755
I wanted to show you something.

38:18.799 --> 38:20.339
So, will you help me figure this out?

38:20.384 --> 38:23.474
I know that it has to be welded.
This part is supposed to twist.

38:49.955 --> 38:53.885
1... 2... 3...

38:54.168 --> 38:57.088
4, 5, 6...

38:57.754 --> 38:58.754
What are you doing?

39:04.469 --> 39:07.759
38, 39, 40.

39:08.098 --> 39:11.228
All right. All right, Dad,
come over here and grab this.

39:11.268 --> 39:12.938
Grab it right in the middle.

39:17.482 --> 39:18.692
Okay. There.

39:18.734 --> 39:21.404
And go up, Jackie go down. You see it?

39:21.445 --> 39:22.455
Not yet.

39:22.487 --> 39:24.527
All right. Here.

39:25.449 --> 39:26.779
- How about now?
- No.

39:27.242 --> 39:28.952
Well you're going to.

39:28.994 --> 39:31.204
I don't see it yet, I mean...

39:35.501 --> 39:37.631
- You ready?
- Yeah.

39:44.718 --> 39:47.298
300 feet of continuous cotton loops.

39:47.721 --> 39:49.311
That's what I drew.

39:50.057 --> 39:54.477
This is why I would like to ask you
for your investment, Trudy.

39:55.646 --> 39:59.436
Morris worked 50 years
to earn his fortune, Joy.

40:00.442 --> 40:04.992
Before he passed on to the next world,
he made me promise on his deathbed...

40:05.030 --> 40:09.160
that I would never be neglectful
with one dollar of the money...

40:09.201 --> 40:11.291
that he so carefully earned.

40:11.995 --> 40:17.415
Therefore you have to answer Morris's
four questions of financial worthiness.

40:17.459 --> 40:18.589
Are you ready?

40:19.711 --> 40:21.091
I think so. Yes.

40:22.673 --> 40:24.303
Question number one:

40:25.050 --> 40:27.340
Where did you go to high school?

40:27.386 --> 40:29.046
Plainfield Public High.

40:29.096 --> 40:33.346
Question number two:
Who were you in high school?

40:34.101 --> 40:35.561
I was valedictorian.

40:36.687 --> 40:39.187
The smartest student in the school.

40:39.231 --> 40:40.521
That's good, right?

40:41.441 --> 40:42.611
Perhaps.

40:43.193 --> 40:48.913
Joy might be a brilliant,
unrealized creator of commerce.

40:49.366 --> 40:50.486
But on the other hand...

40:50.534 --> 40:54.504
it's equally possible that she is
a fatally flawed underachiever...

40:54.538 --> 40:59.668
doomed to a lifetime of failure,
disappointment, unfulfilled expectations.

41:00.752 --> 41:02.462
You must admit, Joy...

41:02.504 --> 41:05.554
that your life, to date,
makes a stronger case for...

41:06.550 --> 41:07.880
...disappointment.

41:10.095 --> 41:11.635
I don't care about any of this.

41:11.680 --> 41:14.560
It's not only risky,
but it's fiscally irresponsible...

41:14.600 --> 41:17.060
and doesn't make any sense, whatsoever.

41:17.102 --> 41:18.602
Joy's never run a business in her life.

41:18.645 --> 41:20.965
I've been running my father's garage
for the last 10 years.

41:21.648 --> 41:23.228
Our father.

41:24.443 --> 41:26.953
I have ventures that I'm planning
to launch here...

41:26.987 --> 41:29.027
at this existing business.

41:29.072 --> 41:31.532
You never mentioned any of this...

41:31.575 --> 41:33.745
until I came to Trudy
to ask for an investment.

41:34.578 --> 41:37.038
What's Morris's third question?

41:37.080 --> 41:38.540
Are you prepared...

41:38.582 --> 41:42.092
within six months of commencing
this venture...

41:42.127 --> 41:44.127
to show adequate returns?

41:44.963 --> 41:46.723
I accept your terms.

41:46.757 --> 41:48.217
Don't do it, Joy.

41:48.258 --> 41:50.258
What's the fourth question?

41:50.302 --> 41:54.812
You are in a room,
and there is a gun on the table.

41:54.848 --> 41:59.558
And the only other person in the room
is an adversary in commerce.

41:59.603 --> 42:01.983
Only one of you can prevail.

42:02.022 --> 42:07.782
Yet, you have protected your business
and Morris's money.

42:09.738 --> 42:11.948
Do you pick up the gun, Joy?

42:13.534 --> 42:15.794
That's a very strange question.

42:15.827 --> 42:19.827
There is nothing strange
about this question at all.

42:19.873 --> 42:21.793
This is money.

42:23.001 --> 42:26.801
Do you pick up the gun?

42:27.756 --> 42:29.336
I pick up the gun.

42:29.383 --> 42:30.513
Good.

42:31.426 --> 42:33.886
I'm going to remember that you said that...

42:34.888 --> 42:37.348
when I speak to my lawyer.

42:38.392 --> 42:40.772
What did Trudy's lawyer say?

42:40.811 --> 42:42.901
He did a worldwide patent search.

42:42.938 --> 42:44.358
What's a patent?

42:45.274 --> 42:48.744
A patent is like a law
that you get to protect your idea.

42:49.111 --> 42:51.361
A lot of people patent their ideas...

42:51.405 --> 42:54.075
but only a few of them
actually get their ideas made.

42:54.908 --> 42:56.948
So Trudy just wanted to be careful...

42:56.994 --> 42:58.374
Joy...

42:58.412 --> 43:02.372
I just wanted to let you know that
Touissant has almost finished his work.

43:02.416 --> 43:03.746
And, um...

43:05.169 --> 43:07.629
You know, we really need to find
some more work for him.

43:07.671 --> 43:09.961
- You want more work in the house?
- Yeah.

43:10.007 --> 43:11.797
I have another big job I have to go to.

43:12.676 --> 43:14.296
- What?
- Yes.

43:14.344 --> 43:16.474
- Well, but we have real issues here.
- Sorry.

43:16.972 --> 43:18.972
- We don't have money for that work, Mom.
- Well...

43:19.683 --> 43:20.683
Okay.

43:21.935 --> 43:23.435
Joy...

43:23.937 --> 43:25.357
What is happening to you, Mother?

43:25.397 --> 43:27.187
I don't know what's going on.

43:27.232 --> 43:28.862
Are you in love with Touissant?

43:30.027 --> 43:32.357
I was feeling alone.

43:33.822 --> 43:37.032
And I didn't even realize it,
you know?

43:37.075 --> 43:38.235
And then...

43:43.707 --> 43:45.877
What did the patent search find?

43:47.127 --> 43:49.207
Trudy just wanted to be careful.

43:49.671 --> 43:52.221
And this guy found a man that's in Texas...

43:52.257 --> 43:55.007
who worked for another guy
in another country...

43:55.052 --> 44:00.022
where they have an idea
that might be similar to my mop.

44:00.057 --> 44:01.307
What country?

44:01.808 --> 44:02.848
Hong Kong.

44:02.893 --> 44:06.693
The Hong Kong man
has a representative in Dallas, Texas.

44:06.730 --> 44:10.400
The Dallas man was very reasonable
with my lawyer.

44:11.693 --> 44:12.743
Hey.

44:19.743 --> 44:21.373
So, this guy in Texas...

44:22.246 --> 44:26.076
We're supposed to pay him a royalty
on the patent as a protection, right?

44:26.333 --> 44:27.043
Right.

44:27.084 --> 44:28.714
To be safe from any claims.

44:28.752 --> 44:29.922
Is that correct?

44:29.962 --> 44:32.052
Please stop using the word "we."

44:32.089 --> 44:34.549
None of this is your money
or your business.

44:34.591 --> 44:38.431
But the same guy
also owns a manufacturing plant...

44:38.470 --> 44:41.560
that you guys say that it's cheaper
than any other place?

44:41.598 --> 44:43.308
- Yes. In California.
- Yes.

44:43.350 --> 44:45.890
A metal and plastic injection mold factory.

44:45.936 --> 44:47.056
Okay, so it's the same guy.

44:47.104 --> 44:48.864
- He owns the patent...
- This happens all the time in business.

44:48.897 --> 44:51.267
You find the best partner. It's smart.

44:51.316 --> 44:53.686
He doesn't understand business.
He doesn't know business.

44:53.735 --> 44:56.105
- No, no, I'm the first to say that.
- I understand business.

44:56.154 --> 44:59.574
Dad and I, we buy parts for the trucks
all the time at the garage.

44:59.616 --> 45:01.406
Morris did it all the time.

45:01.451 --> 45:03.871
One-stop shopping. It's the cheapest.

45:03.912 --> 45:05.332
- But is that normal?
- That's how he made his money.

45:05.372 --> 45:06.542
- Yeah, that's normal.
- Yes!

45:06.582 --> 45:08.382
But is it normal, the same guy
who has the patent...

45:08.417 --> 45:10.097
is the same guy who has the manufacturing?

45:10.127 --> 45:11.457
- Yeah. Make it best.
- Yeah.

45:11.503 --> 45:13.423
- Yeah?
- Better if it's that way.

45:13.463 --> 45:15.593
Okay, and the lawyer?
Right? Morris's lawyer?

45:15.632 --> 45:17.342
- He's good. Let's not make trouble.
- He's very good.

45:17.384 --> 45:21.764
But he specialized in garment business, no?
Not manufacturing business.

45:21.805 --> 45:25.385
Tony. Let's quit while we're ahead.

45:27.519 --> 45:31.939
I know that you want Tony
to be your counselor, if you will...

45:31.982 --> 45:34.032
and I will respect that...

45:34.067 --> 45:38.527
as Tony and you should respect
what we're proposing...

45:38.572 --> 45:41.912
as the lawyer
for this whole business endeavor.

45:46.580 --> 45:49.670
All right. The parts have arrived
from California...

45:49.708 --> 45:51.998
and we can start manufacturing here.

45:52.503 --> 45:54.843
I have the first assembled mop.

45:55.506 --> 45:57.836
I told you it was gonna be more refined.

45:58.634 --> 45:59.844
And it is.

46:01.220 --> 46:02.350
Father Martinez is here.

46:02.387 --> 46:04.597
You need to set those women up right now
and get going.

46:05.057 --> 46:06.927
They're gonna be so grateful
for the jobs, Joy.

46:06.975 --> 46:08.555
Okay. All right.
I'll go talk to those ladies.

46:08.602 --> 46:10.902
Now I finally have jobs for them.

46:42.845 --> 46:44.895
And I'll show you guys how to assemble...

47:07.786 --> 47:09.946
I'm a little proud of you.
I gotta admit it.

47:11.164 --> 47:16.634
But, it costs much more than $15,000
to make the first run.

47:16.670 --> 47:17.840
I know, Trudy.

47:17.880 --> 47:20.080
But with all due respect,
that actually wasn't my fault.

47:20.424 --> 47:22.384
Look at this. More bills.

47:24.595 --> 47:26.935
- What?
- Another bill from Gerhardt.

47:26.972 --> 47:29.722
This guy keeps billing me
for his mistakes.

47:29.766 --> 47:31.846
- That's business.
- No.

47:31.894 --> 47:33.694
That's not the way I do business.

47:33.729 --> 47:35.229
I'm calling this guy.

47:40.611 --> 47:42.701
Gerhardt, I'm not gonna
keep paying for these parts...

47:42.738 --> 47:44.358
that it's taking
you four times to get right.

47:44.406 --> 47:47.406
That was your design.
You have to pay for those parts.

47:47.451 --> 47:50.331
That's mold-making.
That's the process.

47:50.370 --> 47:52.750
My clients pay when we figure it out.

47:52.789 --> 47:54.459
It was not my design, Gerhardt.

47:54.499 --> 47:57.039
It was your mistake. I'm not paying it.

47:57.085 --> 47:59.625
That was your design.
You have to pay.

47:59.671 --> 48:01.591
Did you just hang up on him?

48:01.632 --> 48:05.092
This guy was supposed to be easy
and inexpensive.

48:05.135 --> 48:07.755
He keeps overbilling us.
I'm not paying for it.

48:09.348 --> 48:11.728
Nobody pay it.

48:11.767 --> 48:13.937
I'm gonna fight it out with this guy.

48:13.977 --> 48:17.107
Just assemble them and try to sell them.

48:17.147 --> 48:19.607
Just put it in your window.
Let your customers decide.

48:19.650 --> 48:21.190
My family's been going to you
my whole life.

48:21.235 --> 48:24.155
Look, the big companies,
they pay me for my shelf space.

48:24.655 --> 48:27.245
Maybe you can sell one of your mops
to those big companies.

48:27.282 --> 48:29.912
And maybe they'll put it on my shelf.

48:31.119 --> 48:35.579
It's expensive, at $19.95,
but it's the only mop you'll ever have to buy.

48:35.624 --> 48:39.884
But I don't want people
to buy one mop for $20...

48:39.920 --> 48:41.670
and never have to buy another mop again.

48:41.713 --> 48:46.683
I'd rather they keep buying our mops at $5,
50 times, 100 times.

48:47.553 --> 48:52.103
Look, you were broke and bored.
You had an idea.

48:52.140 --> 48:54.310
So what? Lots of people have ideas.

48:54.768 --> 48:57.438
Go home.
Please, take care of your family.

48:58.522 --> 49:00.652
Hi. Would you like to try a new mop?

49:00.691 --> 49:03.781
It's the only mop
you'll ever have to buy.

49:04.778 --> 49:06.988
- Hi. Would you like to try a new mop?
- No.

49:07.030 --> 49:08.450
It's self-wringing.

49:08.490 --> 49:10.910
You can remove the mop head,
throw it in the washing machine.

49:10.951 --> 49:12.081
- No germs.
- No.

49:12.119 --> 49:13.119
No.

49:13.579 --> 49:15.329
- No?
- Look at that.

49:15.372 --> 49:17.372
You want to just try it?
You could just try.

49:17.416 --> 49:20.586
It can self-wring. See?
No other mop does this.

49:41.773 --> 49:44.233
Come and try the brand-new mop!

49:45.444 --> 49:47.324
- It's the mop of the future.
- No, thanks.

49:48.363 --> 49:49.703
Want to try this mop, ladies?

49:49.740 --> 49:51.030
- What's this?
- Hey, miss.

49:51.074 --> 49:52.414
It's a brand-new mop.

49:53.577 --> 49:55.537
You could wring it
without getting your hands dirty.

49:55.579 --> 49:56.709
I don't think so.

49:56.747 --> 49:59.667
Come on. Try it.
It's the mop of the future.

50:01.418 --> 50:02.538
Self-wringing, huh?

50:02.586 --> 50:03.586
Yeah.

50:03.629 --> 50:06.049
All right. I do like the idea of that.

50:06.089 --> 50:10.049
I hate having to touch the mop head after
I get done cleaning the bathroom floor.

50:10.093 --> 50:11.473
I always think that's disgusting,
you know?

50:11.512 --> 50:12.682
It's so gross.

50:12.721 --> 50:16.601
Wow. It really does get all the corners
that my sponge mop won't get.

50:16.892 --> 50:20.062
All those crannies
where my kids spill their juice.

50:20.979 --> 50:23.149
I really like it. Can we buy it?

50:23.190 --> 50:24.610
Take it easy, Cristy.

50:24.942 --> 50:28.072
Wow. I mean, that's just amazing.
You really don't have to touch it.

50:28.111 --> 50:29.241
Look at that.

50:29.279 --> 50:30.609
You know what would make this perfect...

50:30.656 --> 50:33.066
if you could remove the mop head,
put it in the washing machine...

50:33.116 --> 50:34.776
- Really get it clean.
- That'd be great.

50:35.536 --> 50:36.746
- You can.
- What?

50:36.787 --> 50:37.907
Are you serious?

50:37.955 --> 50:40.255
- Well how much is this mop?
- It's $19.95.

50:40.290 --> 50:41.420
No, that's too much.

50:41.458 --> 50:44.258
But I guess, I mean, if it is the only mop
that you ever have to buy...

50:44.294 --> 50:45.424
I mean we keep buying those
$5 mops.

50:45.462 --> 50:46.802
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie.

50:46.839 --> 50:51.889
You, you remember Angela?
And her two brothers, right?

50:51.927 --> 50:53.717
I do. Hello.

50:53.762 --> 50:55.562
- Mommy, the policeman.
- Ma'am?

50:55.597 --> 50:56.927
Did we break the law?

50:56.974 --> 50:59.274
- I'm taking this merchandise.
- No, no. We're leaving. We're leaving.

50:59.309 --> 51:01.019
- Now, I'm gonna let you off with a warning.
- We were just leaving.

51:01.061 --> 51:02.481
No. Sir...

51:02.521 --> 51:04.271
If the customers can just see
what the mop can do...

51:04.314 --> 51:06.154
But if I catch you out here again,
you will be prosecuted!

51:06.191 --> 51:07.401
Well, where do I go?
Sir, please!

51:07.442 --> 51:09.612
- You cannot sell on Kmart property!
- I made those mops myself.

51:09.653 --> 51:11.403
- I paid for them. Please.
- It took a lot of work.

51:11.446 --> 51:13.606
I won't come back,
but you don't have to take my stuff!

51:13.824 --> 51:14.784
Please!

51:14.825 --> 51:17.045
- Are you even allowed to do this?
- How embarrassing for you...

51:17.077 --> 51:18.697
to be seen here like this
with your daughter.

51:18.745 --> 51:20.825
- What kind of parent are you, huh?
- Yeah, Tony.

51:20.873 --> 51:22.003
- Enough.
- Hey.

51:22.040 --> 51:23.040
Hey, hey, guys. Guys...

51:23.083 --> 51:24.213
- All right.
- Come on.

51:24.251 --> 51:25.631
- Let's go.
- Tony, let's go.

51:25.669 --> 51:27.209
Yeah, I'm coming. I'm coming.

51:38.223 --> 51:41.063
Cristy, honey, it's okay.
Your mommy's okay.

51:44.605 --> 51:47.905
This stupid thing.
This place is falling apart!

51:47.941 --> 51:49.531
No... No.

51:51.528 --> 51:53.568
Honey, the telephone isn't working.

51:53.614 --> 51:55.164
I know. I just got the notice.

51:55.199 --> 51:58.489
I had to go next door to use the phone.
Tommy's got a fever.

51:58.535 --> 51:59.655
Tommy has a fever?

51:59.703 --> 52:02.623
Simple cold with a cough.
It's going around. All the kids have it.

52:02.664 --> 52:04.174
Thank God the heat's still working.

52:04.208 --> 52:06.498
Mommy, why isn't the phone working?

52:06.543 --> 52:08.213
Because I'm late on paying the bill.

52:09.254 --> 52:10.964
- Are we gonna lose our house?
- Not you too.

52:11.006 --> 52:12.586
No, we're not gonna lose our house.

52:13.675 --> 52:15.255
Come on. Get upstairs. Get in the bath.

52:15.302 --> 52:16.762
Listen to your mom and get
right in that tub.

52:16.803 --> 52:18.603
- I don't want a hot bath.
- I don't care.

52:18.639 --> 52:20.809
Cristy, you get in that hot bath.
Listen to your mother.

52:20.849 --> 52:22.729
I don't want you getting sick too.

52:23.435 --> 52:27.105
Lauren Wells said you're a cleaning lady
and sell used mops.

52:28.732 --> 52:30.482
Lauren Wells said that?

52:31.527 --> 52:34.237
Yeah. And it really hurt my feelings.

52:34.905 --> 52:38.285
First of all, even if I was
a cleaning lady, so what?

52:38.325 --> 52:40.125
There's no shame in hard work.

52:41.495 --> 52:43.335
And second of all, you know, I'm...

52:44.998 --> 52:48.588
I'm trying to sell a new mop,
not used mops.

52:49.169 --> 52:54.379
And third of all,
don't take any guff from anybody.

52:54.883 --> 52:58.093
You know, don't let it in.

52:58.846 --> 53:01.886
I know it's hard.
And I'm sorry that happened.

53:03.517 --> 53:04.807
Now get in the bath.

53:12.693 --> 53:14.493
Come on. Go to sleep, honey.

53:28.959 --> 53:30.089
Joy?

53:30.335 --> 53:31.835
Not now, Mimi.

53:31.879 --> 53:34.919
Joy, wait, wait.
Just tell me what happened today.

53:34.965 --> 53:37.345
I want to know how it went.
Please, I want to know.

53:39.595 --> 53:41.015
It was a disaster.

53:41.930 --> 53:43.140
But you must never give up.

53:43.182 --> 53:44.892
Ever since you were little,
you were born to bear...

53:44.933 --> 53:47.143
Born to bear what, Mimi?

53:48.020 --> 53:50.480
Failure? Disgrace?

53:51.690 --> 53:53.980
Humiliation in front of my daughter?

53:54.735 --> 53:58.825
You were born to be
the unanxious presence in the room.

53:58.864 --> 54:01.914
And I know that I'm gonna live
to see you grow...

54:01.950 --> 54:05.330
to be the successful matriarch
that you were born to be.

54:05.370 --> 54:06.370
Matriarch...

54:07.664 --> 54:09.044
To be a mother with courage.

54:09.082 --> 54:10.962
Who can't even support her children.

54:11.376 --> 54:12.456
Sweetheart.

54:16.423 --> 54:18.383
What are you doing here?

54:18.425 --> 54:20.135
I have this idea.

54:20.177 --> 54:21.927
- A guy I know.
- What guy?

54:21.970 --> 54:27.140
He used to work with me.
And now he works at this big retailer.

54:27.184 --> 54:29.484
A new way of doing business.

54:29.520 --> 54:31.310
I mean, it's worth a try.

54:32.689 --> 54:34.729
You would do that for me?

54:34.775 --> 54:36.035
Of course.

54:36.068 --> 54:38.528
They were the best divorced couple
in America.

54:39.488 --> 54:42.198
Much better friends than they were
husband and wife.

54:43.116 --> 54:44.656
I can get you a meeting with him.

54:47.120 --> 54:48.460
Where is it?

54:52.042 --> 54:54.292
But I don't understand
what we're doing in Amish country.

54:54.336 --> 54:56.956
They don't even have electricity out here.
How could they sell anything on TV?

54:57.005 --> 54:59.375
It has nothing to do with Amish people.

54:59.424 --> 55:02.014
It just happens to be located here.
I looked it up.

55:02.052 --> 55:03.802
In Amish country.

55:03.846 --> 55:04.796
Amish.

55:04.847 --> 55:05.677
What?

55:05.722 --> 55:07.722
- Amish.
- Amish.

55:19.736 --> 55:21.066
Sign in, please.

55:22.948 --> 55:25.578
We're here to see Marv Brickman.

55:26.201 --> 55:27.491
Okay.

55:27.536 --> 55:31.076
Marv Brickman, does he know who you are
if I call his office?

55:31.748 --> 55:32.868
Of course he knows.

55:32.916 --> 55:34.666
We're friends. We used to work together.

55:36.420 --> 55:38.090
QVC, please hold.

55:49.308 --> 55:51.888
But Tom was wrong about that.
He was wrong about the numbers...

55:56.064 --> 55:57.274
Tony.

55:57.316 --> 55:58.606
Marv. How are you?

55:58.650 --> 56:00.150
I can't see you today.

56:00.194 --> 56:01.574
Why?

56:01.612 --> 56:03.572
Maybe tomorrow if you can stay in town.

56:03.614 --> 56:06.074
No, we left the kids at home.
We can't.

56:06.116 --> 56:08.026
We can't stay until tomorrow.

56:08.076 --> 56:11.156
Listen, you can't just expect
to come in here and see someone.

56:11.205 --> 56:12.625
Hey, did you take care
of that advertising thing?

56:12.664 --> 56:14.874
- Yes, I did.
- Good. All right.

56:14.917 --> 56:16.037
What's going on here?

56:16.084 --> 56:17.924
- This is my good friend, Tony.
- Tony Miranda.

56:17.961 --> 56:19.421
We worked together at Campbell's.

56:19.463 --> 56:20.423
Neil Walker.

56:20.464 --> 56:22.264
- And this is his ex-wife.
- Good to meet you.

56:22.299 --> 56:23.629
- Joy.
- Hi. Neil.

56:23.675 --> 56:24.835
She's an inventor.

56:24.885 --> 56:28.015
She wanted two minutes of your time today,
but, Neil, don't worry about this.

56:28.055 --> 56:29.475
- Maybe tomorrow.
- You know what?

56:29.515 --> 56:32.275
Why don't you come in for five minutes
while the sales group's still here.

56:32.309 --> 56:33.869
- Okay. Hold my bag.
- Neil, are you sure?

56:33.894 --> 56:35.234
- Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

56:35.270 --> 56:36.650
Thank you.

56:36.688 --> 56:37.858
- Got everything?
- Yeah.

56:37.898 --> 56:39.318
Great. Thank you, man.

56:40.317 --> 56:41.477
Thank you.

56:49.576 --> 56:51.236
So tell us your name, please.

56:54.998 --> 56:56.168
I'm Joy.

56:58.293 --> 57:00.303
And what would you like
to show us today?

57:00.337 --> 57:02.627
I have a self-wringing mop.

57:04.174 --> 57:05.054
Just...

57:05.092 --> 57:06.092
Do you need some help?

57:06.134 --> 57:07.304
No. No, no.

57:07.803 --> 57:08.853
All right.

57:10.013 --> 57:11.813
That's my shoe.

57:11.849 --> 57:13.679
Oh, my goodness. I am so sorry, sir.

57:15.936 --> 57:17.476
Sock's wet.

57:17.521 --> 57:18.691
Do you mind?

57:19.857 --> 57:20.937
Sorry.

57:24.653 --> 57:26.203
Is that plastic?

57:26.238 --> 57:26.988
Yes.

57:27.030 --> 57:29.030
Arnold, why don't you give it a try?
Is that okay?

57:29.074 --> 57:30.244
Yes, of course.

57:30.868 --> 57:32.158
Just dunk it.

57:32.202 --> 57:33.702
- I dip it?
- Yes.

57:34.121 --> 57:36.661
And then I... twist it?

57:36.707 --> 57:38.167
But you pull...
You have to pull it first.

57:38.208 --> 57:39.578
- Pull it and twist it.
- You got to pull it first before you twist it.

57:39.626 --> 57:40.836
- I'm pulling it and...
- Pull and twist.

57:40.878 --> 57:41.918
And I am twisting it.

57:42.796 --> 57:44.756
Pull and twist,
just like when you're on the road.

57:46.675 --> 57:50.175
We don't mean to be disrespectful, Joy.
It's the end of a long day for us.

57:51.555 --> 57:54.935
I feel like I want to tell you
a little bit about who I am.

57:54.975 --> 57:58.405
Because I have a feeling you don't know
exactly where you are right now.

57:58.437 --> 57:59.437
Am I right?

58:01.064 --> 58:02.524
Ten months ago...

58:02.566 --> 58:06.066
a man named Barry Diller
called me from Los Angeles.

58:06.987 --> 58:10.907
He started a television network.
Fox television channel.

58:11.450 --> 58:15.700
And prior to that, he ran 20th Century Fox,
among other studios.

58:16.371 --> 58:19.121
And he acquired a little cable channel...

58:19.166 --> 58:21.706
right here in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

58:21.752 --> 58:23.712
And he hired me to run it...

58:24.421 --> 58:26.511
as a bigger idea.

58:28.759 --> 58:30.679
Now, I'm from Detroit, Michigan.

58:32.095 --> 58:36.675
I ran America's largest, most affordable...

58:36.725 --> 58:39.685
successful, value-driven retailer.

58:39.728 --> 58:41.478
Chain called Kmart.

58:42.105 --> 58:44.975
Prior to that, I was a buyer for Kmart.

58:45.651 --> 58:50.111
And prior to that,
I managed seven separate Kmart stores.

58:50.572 --> 58:53.952
I decide what products
we let into our stores here...

58:53.992 --> 58:59.002
into people's homes, 24 hours a day,
for our valued customers.

59:00.249 --> 59:04.169
I choose very carefully
and very conservatively.

59:05.170 --> 59:09.340
I spend most of my day deflecting
incoming shots from people like yourself.

59:12.052 --> 59:13.092
You see that chart?

59:19.768 --> 59:23.808
This green line either rises
or stays the same each month.

59:24.690 --> 59:27.480
There's no problem
with my product choice.

59:28.986 --> 59:31.566
Do you know what QVC stands for, Joy?

59:33.490 --> 59:34.660
No, I don't.

59:35.409 --> 59:38.749
Quality, Value, Convenience.

59:40.539 --> 59:43.829
I sell product affordably,
but I don't sell cheap product.

59:43.876 --> 59:46.376
And your mop is plastic
and it looks strange.

59:48.839 --> 59:51.339
I don't know anything about charts.

59:51.383 --> 59:52.383
Or...

59:54.094 --> 59:55.854
...business, frankly.

59:56.680 --> 59:58.680
But I do clean my own home.

59:59.725 --> 01:00:01.815
And I made this mop...

01:00:01.852 --> 01:00:05.022
because it is better
than anything else out there.

01:00:08.233 --> 01:00:09.863
Please give me a chance.

01:00:12.196 --> 01:00:13.656
I like that it's plastic...

01:00:13.697 --> 01:00:16.617
because it's so light in my hands,
it's like nothing.

01:00:17.451 --> 01:00:20.661
It's also ten times more absorbent
than any other mop on the market.

01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:21.714
Why?

01:00:22.539 --> 01:00:27.499
Because of 300 feet of continuous
cotton loop that I looped myself.

01:00:27.544 --> 01:00:30.384
That is an enormous
amount of absorbent cotton...

01:00:30.422 --> 01:00:32.262
on a very small mop head.

01:00:32.299 --> 01:00:35.889
Now I'm done with the bathroom,
and I haven't wrung the mop once.

01:00:35.928 --> 01:00:37.548
Let me ask you a question.

01:00:38.388 --> 01:00:39.848
Would you take this mop...

01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:41.350
where you were
just cleaning the bathroom...

01:00:41.391 --> 01:00:43.271
and around the toilet,
and all of those germs...

01:00:43.644 --> 01:00:45.944
and take it into the kitchen...

01:00:45.979 --> 01:00:48.439
where your family eats,
where you feed your children?

01:00:49.733 --> 01:00:52.783
I take this mop head,
I put it in the washing machine...

01:00:52.819 --> 01:00:54.449
it comes out clean like new.

01:00:55.489 --> 01:00:58.949
You can't do that with any other mop.

01:00:59.409 --> 01:01:00.909
- So...
- Stop.

01:01:04.915 --> 01:01:08.255
Can you make 50,000
of these mops by next week?

01:01:10.504 --> 01:01:12.094
Yeah, I think so.

01:01:14.216 --> 01:01:16.796
David Selznick, the son of immigrants...

01:01:16.844 --> 01:01:20.064
married Jennifer Jones from Oklahoma,
America's sweetheart.

01:01:20.097 --> 01:01:22.427
That just goes to show you
that in America...

01:01:22.474 --> 01:01:26.194
the ordinary meets the extraordinary
every single day.

01:01:26.895 --> 01:01:28.645
Thomas. Where are you going with that?

01:01:28.689 --> 01:01:30.399
The skinny pants you wanted.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.110
I never said "skinny pants."
I said, "stovepipe." Classic look.

01:01:33.151 --> 01:01:34.491
I heard "skinny pants"

01:01:34.736 --> 01:01:36.946
You know how much I love the stovepipe.

01:01:36.989 --> 01:01:38.909
- Stovepipe. Classic. Got it.
- Got it.

01:01:38.949 --> 01:01:40.669
- Fine, we'll go for stovepipe.
- Thank you.

01:01:42.286 --> 01:01:46.206
See those guys? I told them so many times
and they still don't understand.

01:01:46.248 --> 01:01:48.118
A very smart guy once said...

01:01:48.167 --> 01:01:51.587
"You tell somebody something once, they don't listen.
You tell somebody four times, they don't listen.

01:01:51.628 --> 01:01:54.758
"By the ninth time you say it,
they begin to hear you."

01:01:54.798 --> 01:01:56.678
That's why we're on 24 hours a day.

01:01:56.717 --> 01:01:59.357
That's why, with the people who I have
to tell about the stovepipe.

01:02:00.554 --> 01:02:02.184
Music in the makeup rooms?

01:02:02.222 --> 01:02:03.722
Yeah, I thought it'd
give a sense of place, Todd.

01:02:03.765 --> 01:02:06.095
But if you don't want it,
you can always turn it down.

01:02:06.143 --> 01:02:07.313
You're our biggest seller, Todd.

01:02:07.352 --> 01:02:09.522
Whatever you need to make you comfortable.
You're who we care about.

01:02:09.563 --> 01:02:10.613
You're our number-one seller.

01:02:10.647 --> 01:02:11.857
- What?
- Oh, no.

01:02:13.192 --> 01:02:14.692
He's your number-one seller?

01:02:14.735 --> 01:02:17.955
No, no, no. Cindy, please.
You know that we love you.

01:02:18.822 --> 01:02:20.032
Oh, for heaven sake.

01:02:20.365 --> 01:02:24.405
She's never had a professional attitude.
Clearly, she's jealous.

01:02:24.786 --> 01:02:26.706
But could you do me a favor?
Make her your friend.

01:02:26.747 --> 01:02:30.127
Could you just do me that favor, Todd?
Please?

01:02:30.167 --> 01:02:31.167
For me?

01:02:32.169 --> 01:02:33.249
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

01:02:33.295 --> 01:02:36.535
This is Joy. She has a very exciting new mop
that we're gonna introduce next week.

01:02:36.798 --> 01:02:38.928
I would like you to launch it.
You're my first choice.

01:02:38.967 --> 01:02:40.337
A mop?

01:02:40.385 --> 01:02:43.885
You want me to bring this newborn
into the world?

01:02:44.765 --> 01:02:50.355
That newborn that you're holding is
every cent, every dollar, even debt...

01:02:50.395 --> 01:02:51.395
that I've ever made.

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.310
Every cent you've ever made?

01:02:53.607 --> 01:02:54.687
That's right.

01:02:54.733 --> 01:02:56.783
That kind of pressure is not helpful.

01:02:57.236 --> 01:02:58.736
- What?
- No

01:02:58.779 --> 01:03:00.989
It's not part of my process, either.

01:03:01.406 --> 01:03:02.566
Oh.

01:03:02.866 --> 01:03:06.236
- Todd...
- I didn't mean to pressure you, Todd.

01:03:08.247 --> 01:03:10.647
- Performers can be finicky creatures.
- He's very sensitive.

01:03:10.707 --> 01:03:14.167
He is our number-one seller.
He is selling everything through the roof...

01:03:14.211 --> 01:03:16.381
in numbers we've never seen before.

01:03:16.797 --> 01:03:18.047
I take it very seriously.

01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:20.300
I see it as a privilege that we have
to go into people's homes.

01:03:20.342 --> 01:03:22.092
And I despise anybody
who's cynical about that.

01:03:22.135 --> 01:03:25.635
Jack Warner wasn't cynical about that.
Darryl Zanuck wasn't cynical about that.

01:03:25.681 --> 01:03:27.521
And Neil Walker is not cynical about that.

01:03:27.558 --> 01:03:29.388
Let me show you the stage.

01:03:30.727 --> 01:03:32.727
I believe eventually, one day...

01:03:32.771 --> 01:03:37.731
television will even be
by and about actual regular people.

01:03:37.776 --> 01:03:40.986
Maybe even on computers,
24 hours a day.

01:03:41.238 --> 01:03:43.738
Who knows?
Nobody thought this network would be real.

01:03:44.783 --> 01:03:46.163
And here we are.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:49.110
- By the way, stock's going through the roof.
- What...?

01:03:51.456 --> 01:03:53.036
Must be mindful of Joan's dog.

01:03:53.083 --> 01:03:56.253
Who's... Who's Joan?

01:03:57.087 --> 01:03:59.297
Thank you, darling.

01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:03.220
You're never gonna make it
in a man's world dressed like that.

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:05.800
Mr. Peepers, you were almost
a Peepers pancake.

01:04:05.846 --> 01:04:09.636
It's a round stage that has four
or five different sets that rotate...

01:04:09.683 --> 01:04:12.483
depending on what we're selling
at a given moment.

01:04:12.519 --> 01:04:13.939
The clasp is part of the necklace. See?

01:04:13.979 --> 01:04:16.899
Look at the quality in this clasp.
That's what we do.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:17.940
Absolutely exquisite.

01:04:18.108 --> 01:04:21.318
Here comes Joan and Cindy.
Watch this.

01:04:22.112 --> 01:04:23.202
These guys are major.

01:04:23.614 --> 01:04:24.994
Joan's the original seller.

01:04:25.032 --> 01:04:28.412
If you're just starting your jewelry wardrobe,
can you do anything better than this?

01:04:28.452 --> 01:04:31.002
You're gonna mix in your blacks,
your golds, your pearls.

01:04:31.038 --> 01:04:32.078
- Everything.
- Everything.

01:04:32.122 --> 01:04:33.502
Look at it against the peach. Okay?

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:35.170
- Look at that.
- Morning.

01:04:35.209 --> 01:04:36.789
- Look at that.
- Green. Afternoon.

01:04:36.835 --> 01:04:38.415
- Look. Black, night.
- Black, evening.

01:04:38.462 --> 01:04:40.802
- Of course at night.
- I mean, can you be more elegant?

01:04:40.839 --> 01:04:43.129
So it's functional. Elegant.

01:04:43.175 --> 01:04:45.845
You can wear it alone.
You can wear it... What I love...

01:04:45.886 --> 01:04:48.096
See. Stars and people,
they always make the mistake.

01:04:48.138 --> 01:04:50.138
They think it's about the face,
but it's not.

01:04:50.182 --> 01:04:51.772
It's about the hands.

01:04:51.808 --> 01:04:53.178
Because that's what people use.

01:04:53.227 --> 01:04:55.017
They hold things they care about.

01:04:55.062 --> 01:04:57.522
And her hands are gonna become
their hands.

01:04:57.564 --> 01:04:58.944
And that becomes them.

01:04:58.982 --> 01:05:01.442
And then their voice,
and then their eyes.

01:05:01.485 --> 01:05:02.995
Stars always make the mistake.

01:05:03.362 --> 01:05:06.492
It's really about the hands and the voice.
That's the heart of it.

01:05:07.366 --> 01:05:09.576
Number J-6276.

01:05:09.993 --> 01:05:11.333
A $100 value.

01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:12.750
Are they not phenomenal?

01:05:13.497 --> 01:05:15.287
- Now watch this.
- These can be yours.

01:05:15.332 --> 01:05:17.962
- Cindy's gonna lay this down right...
- But you need to call in right now.

01:05:18.001 --> 01:05:19.041
$39.99.

01:05:19.753 --> 01:05:20.753
...now!

01:05:21.004 --> 01:05:23.054
You need this. You can get this.

01:05:23.090 --> 01:05:24.670
You need to call right now, though.

01:05:25.175 --> 01:05:27.635
- I'm being told we have limited quantity left.
- Watch the calls come in.

01:05:27.678 --> 01:05:29.468
Watch them. Here they come.

01:05:29.513 --> 01:05:32.023
For $39.99,
you might as well get several.

01:05:32.057 --> 01:05:34.347
Calls coming in now.

01:05:34.393 --> 01:05:36.193
Calls. Calls.

01:05:36.228 --> 01:05:39.518
Calls. Calls. Calls. Calls.

01:05:39.565 --> 01:05:41.735
Look at the count.
I guarantee we're gonna go over twenty.

01:05:41.775 --> 01:05:43.565
Those are FTC standards.
Those are legal.

01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:46.070
Those are coming in. Keep your eyes...
Those are actual sales, Joy.

01:05:46.113 --> 01:05:47.493
Lines are busy?

01:05:47.531 --> 01:05:49.031
- Is the queue full?
- Queue's full.

01:05:49.741 --> 01:05:51.371
Okay. We need a phone call right now.

01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:53.540
When they can't call through,
we gotta keep them watching.

01:05:53.579 --> 01:05:55.209
Did we get a call? Did we get a call?

01:05:55.247 --> 01:05:56.407
Okay. Got it.

01:05:56.456 --> 01:05:57.866
Keep this going. Phone call right now.

01:05:57.916 --> 01:05:59.996
Wait, wait, wait!
We have a caller! We have a caller!

01:06:00.544 --> 01:06:02.554
Sharon from Colorado. Hi, Sharon.

01:06:02.588 --> 01:06:03.508
Hi, Sharon.

01:06:03.547 --> 01:06:05.877
Cindy and Joan!
I can't believe I'm talking to you!

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:08.430
Are you happy with your necklace?

01:06:08.468 --> 01:06:13.008
These necklaces are so gorgeous
and timeless.

01:06:13.056 --> 01:06:15.266
- My great-grandmother had things like this.
- Yes, yes. Keep it going.

01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:18.309
I am so excited to have these.

01:06:18.562 --> 01:06:21.902
Keep it going. Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.940
Get one for your mother.
Get one for your sister.

01:06:23.984 --> 01:06:25.444
Watch the counter, Joy. Joy.

01:06:25.485 --> 01:06:28.065
- You will not regret owning this.
- No, you will not.

01:06:28.113 --> 01:06:29.413
See those numbers?

01:06:29.448 --> 01:06:31.158
We're gonna wind up at 25,000.

01:06:32.409 --> 01:06:33.909
Cindy knows how to close it.

01:06:34.161 --> 01:06:35.161
Wow.

01:06:36.121 --> 01:06:38.211
Okay, I want you to go home,
I want you to call your lawyer.

01:06:38.248 --> 01:06:39.618
Look at your contract.

01:06:39.666 --> 01:06:42.126
Make sure your product factory
is in line.

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.300
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:06:45.339 --> 01:06:48.259
Okay, Godspeed, good luck.
Here we go. I'll walk you out.

01:06:51.261 --> 01:06:56.021
You can't expect Trudy to write a check
for $200,000 for 50,000 mops...

01:06:56.475 --> 01:07:00.355
when you already owe her $18,000
to make mops you haven't even sold yet.

01:07:01.522 --> 01:07:08.072
Do you understand that there is a business
that wants to sell my mop on television?

01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:09.781
It's going to sell.

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.990
Fine. You feel so strongly about it,
you put up half the money.

01:07:14.284 --> 01:07:17.754
Yes. It's only fair that you share
the financial risk, too.

01:07:17.788 --> 01:07:21.248
How's she gonna do that?
She's got nothing. She's got no money.

01:07:23.252 --> 01:07:25.922
What, do you want me to take out
a second mortgage on my house?

01:07:31.009 --> 01:07:33.429
They want me to take out
a second mortgage on my house.

01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:35.060
A second mortgage?

01:07:35.097 --> 01:07:36.557
But the house, the kids, Joy.

01:07:36.598 --> 01:07:38.768
What's gonna happen, Joy?
How would you do that?

01:07:38.809 --> 01:07:39.809
I don't know.

01:07:54.616 --> 01:07:56.326
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hey.

01:07:56.368 --> 01:07:58.948
You know I've been watching you through
that fence since you were a little girl?

01:07:58.996 --> 01:08:00.456
- Yeah.
- I've been watching you grow up.

01:08:00.497 --> 01:08:01.787
- Hey, listen.
- What?

01:08:01.832 --> 01:08:03.922
You think it would be okay if I...

01:08:03.959 --> 01:08:05.789
- You wanna fire a few rounds?
- I do.

01:08:05.836 --> 01:08:06.956
Yeah. Might make you feel better.

01:08:07.004 --> 01:08:08.134
Thank you. I think it will.

01:08:08.172 --> 01:08:09.802
- You know how to hold it?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.970
Okay. Sure.

01:08:14.678 --> 01:08:15.678
Good.

01:08:16.138 --> 01:08:17.138
Good.

01:08:18.182 --> 01:08:19.182
Good.

01:08:19.892 --> 01:08:20.892
Good.

01:08:37.158 --> 01:08:39.828
This is it! Oh, my gosh.

01:08:40.537 --> 01:08:43.787
Get ready. This is definitely
gonna change the holidays...

01:08:43.832 --> 01:08:46.841
for anyone who has a floor
or a bathroom...

01:08:46.877 --> 01:08:49.877
because we have the most exciting
new home product in years.

01:08:50.171 --> 01:08:51.301
Yeah!

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:54.720
This is the new self-wringing mop.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:55.890
Okay, okay, okay!

01:08:55.928 --> 01:08:58.808
It's the new standard in homes,
right here.

01:08:58.846 --> 01:09:01.977
Let's take a look at this.
This is brought to you only by QVC.

01:09:02.017 --> 01:09:07.557
Now, this is clearly extremely
soft and absorbent cotton.

01:09:08.357 --> 01:09:09.687
There we go.

01:09:09.733 --> 01:09:13.033
You just take this, and you...

01:09:13.569 --> 01:09:14.859
start...

01:09:14.904 --> 01:09:17.245
I'm not sure.
This is a little trickier than it looks.

01:09:18.617 --> 01:09:19.617
Put it...

01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:22.410
Well, it's getting my arm wet, here.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.250
Let's see. We got no sales here.

01:09:25.916 --> 01:09:27.036
What happened?

01:09:27.084 --> 01:09:28.294
Is there a call?

01:09:30.045 --> 01:09:32.125
So there... So there are no calls.

01:09:33.756 --> 01:09:34.756
All right.

01:09:36.593 --> 01:09:41.513
And we do not have any sales still
so here's what we're gonna do.

01:09:42.057 --> 01:09:44.267
We're gonna move on.
Now, we're gonna move on.

01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:48.689
Cindy is gonna talk to Sarina Kimball,
former star from Falcon Crest and Dynasty...

01:09:49.731 --> 01:09:54.071
and she is gonna tell us
all about her new line of gowns.

01:09:55.279 --> 01:09:58.489
These are my special occasion gowns...

01:09:58.949 --> 01:10:00.949
"Special." How apropos.

01:10:00.993 --> 01:10:07.503
...that were inspired by all of the times
that I was in Dynasty and Falcon Crest.

01:10:07.958 --> 01:10:10.038
That is absolutely amazing.

01:10:10.085 --> 01:10:12.375
I want you to pan in. Look at these.

01:10:12.421 --> 01:10:14.421
- Look at the detail.
- Look at the detail.

01:10:14.464 --> 01:10:16.264
Look at the value in that.

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.430
About how many sequins
would you say that is?

01:10:18.468 --> 01:10:19.588
That's it?

01:10:19.636 --> 01:10:20.756
- That's all?
- No, it's over.

01:10:20.804 --> 01:10:22.144
That's how fast it happens.

01:10:22.181 --> 01:10:23.471
No, they're gonna give her
a second chance.

01:10:23.515 --> 01:10:25.305
No, they're not gonna give her
a second chance.

01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:27.440
That's not what's gonna happen.

01:10:27.477 --> 01:10:29.767
They're going to give her
a second chance.

01:10:29.813 --> 01:10:31.773
- Why do you have to be so negative?
- They will.

01:10:31.815 --> 01:10:33.645
$200,000!

01:10:35.027 --> 01:10:36.317
50,000 mops.

01:10:36.862 --> 01:10:40.372
Now, this is easily one of my favorites.

01:10:40.407 --> 01:10:41.907
She's wearing the black and gold...

01:11:09.019 --> 01:11:10.099
Joy.

01:11:15.859 --> 01:11:16.939
Hello?

01:11:19.112 --> 01:11:21.952
5,107 sequins for...

01:11:22.366 --> 01:11:24.276
Get this. How much?

01:11:24.326 --> 01:11:25.326
$299.

01:11:29.206 --> 01:11:31.206
I'm sorry the product didn't sell.

01:11:34.503 --> 01:11:37.303
That man didn't know
what he was doing, Neil.

01:11:38.882 --> 01:11:42.222
Well, it wasn't the man, Joy.
It was the product.

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:51.730
I made 50,000 units
because you told me to.

01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:56.399
I mortgaged my house,
I'm in $200,000 of debt. More.

01:11:58.068 --> 01:12:00.778
Well, it's your business.
It's your debt.

01:12:00.821 --> 01:12:03.911
And we indemnify up to a third,
if you read your contract.

01:12:04.825 --> 01:12:07.415
To be honest,
that's even gonna be hard to get.

01:12:09.329 --> 01:12:11.659
Neil, you gotta give us another chance.

01:12:12.541 --> 01:12:13.881
I'm so sorry, Joy.

01:12:13.917 --> 01:12:16.707
I just can't bring it to my boss.
I can't.

01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:21.590
I can't accept your answer.

01:12:22.926 --> 01:12:26.096
I can't, and I won't.

01:12:27.931 --> 01:12:31.561
Joy, you have to let Trudy
report this loss in bankruptcy...

01:12:31.602 --> 01:12:34.522
because otherwise she's gonna
hemorrhage even more money.

01:12:34.563 --> 01:12:36.403
You have to file, too...

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.230
because you mortgaged your
children's future and you lost...

01:12:39.276 --> 01:12:41.776
and you have to
prepare yourself for that.

01:12:42.279 --> 01:12:43.739
You have to file for bankruptcy.

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:45.870
I warned you so many times, Joy!

01:12:45.908 --> 01:12:47.528
Dad, I warned you
to not spend her money!

01:12:47.576 --> 01:12:50.746
Come on! You've been plotting against her
from the very beginning, Peggy!

01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:52.457
Now we're bankrupt, Tony!

01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:56.211
I'm in a meeting with our lawyers.

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.250
What do you think you're doing?

01:13:00.297 --> 01:13:05.297
"Go home, Joy, and watch the numbers
roll in on television.

01:13:06.136 --> 01:13:08.716
"Make 50,000 mops...

01:13:08.764 --> 01:13:12.434
"borrowing and owing every dollar,
including your home."

01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:14.730
It could have been handled better.

01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:16.270
I'll let Todd have another shot.

01:13:16.313 --> 01:13:19.443
I don't want Todd
or anyone else to try it.

01:13:19.483 --> 01:13:21.283
It should be me.

01:13:21.318 --> 01:13:22.608
We don't have regular people.

01:13:22.653 --> 01:13:25.913
We have celebrities or spokesmodels
do the selling.

01:13:25.948 --> 01:13:27.408
I told you this.

01:13:28.283 --> 01:13:29.953
Who showed you the mop?

01:13:29.993 --> 01:13:32.203
Who sold it to you?
Who taught you how to use it?

01:13:32.246 --> 01:13:35.666
And who convinced you that it was great
after you thought it was worthless?

01:13:40.671 --> 01:13:42.591
Excuse me, can you give us a second?

01:13:43.757 --> 01:13:45.127
Come with me.

01:13:55.143 --> 01:13:58.233
You ever been in front of a TV camera?
You comfortable in front of a TV camera?

01:13:58.272 --> 01:14:02.152
Because when you get there, there's lights
and there's camera, and people freeze up.

01:14:02.776 --> 01:14:05.816
You said to me that David Selznick,
the son of immigrants...

01:14:05.863 --> 01:14:09.493
married Jennifer Jones,
an all-American girl from Oklahoma...

01:14:09.533 --> 01:14:13.503
because in America,
all races and all classes...

01:14:13.537 --> 01:14:16.827
can meet and make
whatever opportunities they can.

01:14:16.874 --> 01:14:22.134
And that is what you feel when you reach
into people's homes with what you sell.

01:14:26.383 --> 01:14:28.133
You said that.

01:14:29.178 --> 01:14:31.848
What do you think? Looks great, right?

01:14:33.557 --> 01:14:35.427
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Beautiful.

01:14:35.475 --> 01:14:36.885
Very vogue, very classic.

01:14:37.394 --> 01:14:40.024
All right, if you come back next time...
Lori? Lori?

01:14:40.063 --> 01:14:45.153
I just want you to just put the hair a little bit forward,
just like that, if she comes back again.

01:14:45.527 --> 01:14:47.817
Okay? Not with the comb,
not with the comb.

01:14:47.863 --> 01:14:49.493
- Try the black.
- Okay.

01:14:49.531 --> 01:14:50.781
Okay?

01:14:50.824 --> 01:14:51.834
It's gonna be perfect.

01:15:04.588 --> 01:15:05.588
Wow.

01:15:09.176 --> 01:15:11.586
Beautiful. What do you think?
How do you feel?

01:15:13.096 --> 01:15:15.716
I'd like to change just one thing.
Would you mind?

01:15:16.099 --> 01:15:18.389
- Okay, surprise me.
- Small thing.

01:15:18.435 --> 01:15:19.385
I'll surprise you.

01:15:19.436 --> 01:15:20.596
Okay, surprise me.

01:15:23.565 --> 01:15:26.435
What would the small thing be
that she changes?

01:15:30.447 --> 01:15:31.447
What?

01:15:31.949 --> 01:15:33.699
You undid the whole thing.

01:15:34.785 --> 01:15:35.745
This is me.

01:15:35.786 --> 01:15:37.036
This is you?

01:15:37.079 --> 01:15:39.579
You've got the exact same outfit
you had when you came in here.

01:15:39.623 --> 01:15:41.923
I wear a blouse and I wear pants.

01:15:41.959 --> 01:15:43.629
That's who I am.

01:15:44.086 --> 01:15:45.746
I want to go on as me.

01:15:47.089 --> 01:15:48.419
Gonna go on as you.

01:15:48.966 --> 01:15:50.626
I hope you make it back.

01:15:51.426 --> 01:15:53.676
Joan, Cindy. Say good luck to Joy.

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:54.720
- Wow.
- Wow.

01:15:54.763 --> 01:15:56.103
You look great. Good luck today.

01:15:56.139 --> 01:15:57.269
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

01:15:57.307 --> 01:15:58.597
That's her, that's how she is.

01:15:58.642 --> 01:16:01.062
Blouse and... She should be in a skirt.
She's got nice long legs.

01:16:01.103 --> 01:16:02.103
Show her legs.

01:16:02.271 --> 01:16:03.441
Good luck.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:06.690
Joan Rivers wants me in a skirt,
but I'm gonna do pants.

01:16:06.733 --> 01:16:08.153
Do what you want to do.

01:16:08.652 --> 01:16:10.072
Come on, let's go upstairs.

01:16:19.955 --> 01:16:21.085
Are you nervous?

01:16:21.123 --> 01:16:22.123
Yes.

01:16:22.833 --> 01:16:24.213
Just be yourself.

01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:25.851
Just remember, it's all about the hands.

01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:27.840
Here we go.

01:16:43.353 --> 01:16:46.363
Ready... Stage is moving!

01:16:46.773 --> 01:16:51.033
Household product 375 in three, two...

01:16:56.617 --> 01:16:59.037
What are you doing? Come on.

01:16:59.328 --> 01:17:01.538
Go! Go!

01:17:02.998 --> 01:17:04.538
She's freezing.

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:08.960
Sorry, these lights are so bright.

01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:14.340
Nobody tells you how bright these lights...
Well, Neil did tell me.

01:17:16.345 --> 01:17:19.395
Neil is my boss. Here.

01:17:20.891 --> 01:17:23.391
I should thank him
for letting me be up here.

01:17:24.728 --> 01:17:26.308
- Sorry.
- You're Joy.

01:17:26.355 --> 01:17:27.485
I am Joy.

01:17:27.523 --> 01:17:30.533
Just say something!
Talk about the mop!

01:17:30.567 --> 01:17:31.687
Oh, my God.

01:17:31.735 --> 01:17:32.895
We have to do something.

01:17:34.071 --> 01:17:35.571
We have to do something.

01:17:36.323 --> 01:17:37.703
Do we have a call?

01:17:37.741 --> 01:17:38.871
- Could we go to a call?
- We have a call.

01:17:38.909 --> 01:17:40.199
- It's a friendly call?
- It's a friendly call.

01:17:40.244 --> 01:17:42.414
Okay. Take it. Take it.

01:17:42.829 --> 01:17:44.039
Joy, we have a call.

01:17:44.081 --> 01:17:46.211
A call? How did that happen?

01:17:47.084 --> 01:17:48.594
Well, we have a call.

01:17:48.877 --> 01:17:50.497
Hi. Joanne from New York.

01:17:50.546 --> 01:17:51.666
Joanne from New York.

01:17:51.713 --> 01:17:54.173
We have a call coming in
from Joanne from New York.

01:17:54.424 --> 01:17:59.014
Yeah, I'm calling in because I would love a
mop that I don't have to touch when I wring it.

01:17:59.054 --> 01:18:02.144
You know, my hands get raw
and when I mop broken glass...

01:18:02.182 --> 01:18:04.932
and I wring the mop, I cut my hands.

01:18:06.728 --> 01:18:09.188
Do you ever cut your hands
when you're wringing?

01:18:09.231 --> 01:18:11.691
Joanne, that is so funny
that you said that.

01:18:11.733 --> 01:18:16.243
That is actually exactly how
I was inspired to invent this mop.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:21.490
There was glass shattered everywhere.
I was with my two kids, with my father, and I...

01:18:21.535 --> 01:18:24.795
Every time I would wring the mop,
I would get glass shards in my hands.

01:18:25.247 --> 01:18:28.417
And the old mop
just wasn't very absorbent.

01:18:28.458 --> 01:18:33.668
So I went to my daughter's room,
and I borrowed her crayons...

01:18:33.714 --> 01:18:36.304
and I designed this mop.

01:18:36.925 --> 01:18:38.085
Make sure you get down there.
Yeah, that's it.

01:18:38.468 --> 01:18:40.828
It's made of plastic, so it's lightweight,
but very durable.

01:18:41.096 --> 01:18:42.506
Go in. Go in to the hands.

01:18:42.556 --> 01:18:43.516
It's extremely absorbent...

01:18:43.557 --> 01:18:46.097
with 300 continuous cotton loops...

01:18:46.143 --> 01:18:48.483
that I looped myself
when I designed it.

01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:51.770
- How much is it?
- It is $19.95.

01:18:52.316 --> 01:18:54.316
I like that price.
I want a whole bunch of them.

01:18:55.068 --> 01:18:56.318
Thank you.

01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:58.530
H375. That's the order number.

01:18:58.572 --> 01:19:00.782
Household item 375.

01:19:00.824 --> 01:19:01.954
I guarantee you...

01:19:01.992 --> 01:19:03.282
That's it. Stay right there.

01:19:03.327 --> 01:19:05.537
...you are not going to find
another mop like this that exists.

01:19:05.579 --> 01:19:08.919
If there was, I would have bought it
and I wouldn't have cut my hands up.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.920
You can get across the whole kitchen
with one wring. Just imagine that.

01:19:13.962 --> 01:19:15.302
Watch this.

01:19:16.465 --> 01:19:17.925
Chocolate syrup.

01:19:20.093 --> 01:19:21.393
Go the syrup. Go the syrup.

01:19:21.428 --> 01:19:24.138
Baby food.
A very big spill at my house.

01:19:24.181 --> 01:19:25.561
Very common spill for me.

01:19:25.599 --> 01:19:27.179
No. Hands, hands.

01:19:27.809 --> 01:19:31.729
Now, the biggest difference,
I don't have to touch this disgusting mop head.

01:19:31.772 --> 01:19:33.772
There's not another mop on the market...

01:19:33.815 --> 01:19:38.485
that has as much absorbent cotton
as this mop right here.

01:19:38.529 --> 01:19:42.449
And I guarantee you,
there will be no regrets, no returns.

01:19:42.491 --> 01:19:45.661
I have been mopping for most of my life,
every single day.

01:19:45.702 --> 01:19:46.832
Phones are ringing!

01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:49.120
I cannot tell you how much
this mop has changed my life.

01:19:49.164 --> 01:19:51.124
- Phones are ringing! Phones are ringing!
- The phones are ringing. The phones are ringing.

01:19:51.375 --> 01:19:52.045
Go.

01:19:52.292 --> 01:19:55.422
This is gonna be the greatest mop
to have around Christmas time...

01:19:55.462 --> 01:19:57.462
when you have family over...

01:19:57.506 --> 01:20:01.586
I am a mother of two.
There is just spill after spill.

01:20:01.635 --> 01:20:03.435
Family comes to town.

01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:05.890
You can mop your entire kitchen
with one wring!

01:20:06.139 --> 01:20:08.889
Oh, my God! 29,000!

01:20:09.142 --> 01:20:10.772
This is very special!

01:20:10.811 --> 01:20:13.521
I haven't even told you about
my personal favorite feature...

01:20:13.564 --> 01:20:15.694
which is the removable mop head...

01:20:15.732 --> 01:20:20.702
that I can put into the washing machine
and it will come out clean as new.

01:20:20.737 --> 01:20:22.237
Yes! Yes!

01:20:22.281 --> 01:20:24.621
Oh, my God, these numbers keep climbing!

01:20:25.576 --> 01:20:26.866
Thank you. I...

01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:28.240
Yes, that's right. Keep it going.

01:20:28.287 --> 01:20:29.287
Thank you.

01:20:30.622 --> 01:20:33.582
This is the most absorbent
mop on the market. It's lightweight.

01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:37.045
It's the only mop that you're ever gonna buy,
the best mop you're ever gonna use.

01:20:37.087 --> 01:20:41.507
It is lightweight and durable, and that is
just me speaking from my experience.

01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:45.600
As someone who mops their house
every single day, from my heart.

01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:50.100
This woman's gonna be
a whole new business.

01:20:51.977 --> 01:20:52.977
No way.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.730
Oh, my God.

01:21:19.922 --> 01:21:23.432
Can you believe it?
Can you believe it?

01:21:23.467 --> 01:21:26.967
I thought for sure you were gonna tell me
that your counting machine was broken.

01:21:27.012 --> 01:21:28.812
I listened to you. You were right.

01:21:28.847 --> 01:21:31.467
I just can't believe
that actually happened.

01:21:31.517 --> 01:21:32.637
I know.

01:21:32.684 --> 01:21:35.234
I guess you could say
we're friends in commerce.

01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:36.440
Friends in commerce.

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.440
Yeah.

01:21:37.481 --> 01:21:41.111
Let's promise each other that if, one day,
and that day may come...

01:21:41.151 --> 01:21:44.611
that we become adversaries in commerce,
that we remain friends.

01:21:44.655 --> 01:21:46.415
Because that's a true friendship indeed.

01:21:46.448 --> 01:21:47.698
Friends in commerce.

01:21:48.325 --> 01:21:50.335
I agree. Let's shake on it.

01:22:31.076 --> 01:22:33.036
We've got 10 looms...

01:22:33.078 --> 01:22:36.618
and then when they're completed,
this is where the mop heads are sewn.

01:22:38.834 --> 01:22:40.174
Who makes your parts?

01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:42.499
A factory out in California.

01:22:42.546 --> 01:22:45.336
It was cheaper and faster
than any place around here.

01:22:45.382 --> 01:22:47.722
Smart. Are they gonna be able
to stay on schedule?

01:22:49.178 --> 01:22:50.178
Yeah.

01:22:57.227 --> 01:22:58.437
One time.

01:23:18.123 --> 01:23:19.253
- Right there.
- Thank you.

01:23:19.291 --> 01:23:20.491
- You're welcome.
- Right here?

01:23:22.252 --> 01:23:23.252
Hello?

01:24:24.314 --> 01:24:25.444
Mimi.

01:24:28.277 --> 01:24:29.357
Mimi.

01:24:44.626 --> 01:24:46.996
I so hated to leave her that day.

01:24:48.172 --> 01:24:50.762
I had so much I wanted to say to her.

01:24:51.675 --> 01:24:53.715
And to my great granddaughter.

01:24:56.471 --> 01:25:01.561
I felt I wanted to stay near her
and watch over her.

01:26:07.668 --> 01:26:09.288
Cristy.

01:26:15.384 --> 01:26:17.344
There's a problem in California.

01:26:17.386 --> 01:26:21.636
There can't be a problem in California.
I told Neil that everything was fine.

01:26:21.682 --> 01:26:24.812
Gerhardt keeps raising his price.
He just did it again.

01:26:24.852 --> 01:26:25.852
More money per unit.

01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:29.309
He can't do that.
We're gonna lose money.

01:26:29.356 --> 01:26:31.476
I sent a representative to handle him.

01:26:32.693 --> 01:26:34.653
Representative?
We don't have a representative.

01:26:34.695 --> 01:26:36.245
What representative?

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:37.990
Peggy went.

01:26:38.282 --> 01:26:39.412
Peggy?

01:26:43.871 --> 01:26:45.831
I don't want to talk about this
right now.

01:26:54.798 --> 01:26:56.168
She wanted to be part of it.

01:26:56.216 --> 01:26:58.216
How could you send Peggy?

01:27:02.931 --> 01:27:04.891
She wanted to be part of it.

01:27:05.726 --> 01:27:09.936
You both are blood relatives.
You're half-sisters.

01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:13.730
It's very, very important
that you love and respect each other.

01:27:16.236 --> 01:27:20.526
I paid them the 20
that you owed them. I had to.

01:27:22.284 --> 01:27:25.914
I got them to fill the order
of the 100,000...

01:27:25.954 --> 01:27:28.584
with a price increase
of only two dollars per unit.

01:27:28.624 --> 01:27:33.214
We can't increase at all, Peggy.
Don't you understand?

01:27:35.464 --> 01:27:38.174
We sold at a certain price.

01:27:39.009 --> 01:27:42.759
Any hikes,
especially the ones he's asking for...

01:27:42.804 --> 01:27:44.814
mean that I will lose so much money...

01:27:44.848 --> 01:27:49.098
that I'll be in even more debt
than I was before.

01:27:51.146 --> 01:27:52.766
You're gonna make it back.

01:27:53.607 --> 01:27:55.727
I'm gonna make it back?

01:27:56.568 --> 01:27:57.568
How?

01:28:02.741 --> 01:28:04.831
I've got ideas, you know.

01:28:06.828 --> 01:28:09.248
There are things that I'd like to do.

01:28:09.289 --> 01:28:13.079
I spoke to him about a project
that Dad and I have been designing.

01:28:13.126 --> 01:28:14.416
Right, Dad?

01:28:14.461 --> 01:28:15.921
Yes, we did.

01:28:18.048 --> 01:28:22.838
Do you have any idea
how much your idea will cost?

01:28:22.886 --> 01:28:24.966
How or where you'll sell it?

01:28:25.639 --> 01:28:28.929
If you can even manufacture it
after it's taken everything we've got...

01:28:28.976 --> 01:28:32.596
to sell this one product that now,
thanks to you...

01:28:32.646 --> 01:28:34.646
is going to cost more money?

01:28:35.274 --> 01:28:38.114
Maybe my product
is better than your product.

01:28:38.151 --> 01:28:40.701
I can do what you did on TV.
It's not that hard.

01:28:40.737 --> 01:28:44.317
Isn't that the whole purpose of that channel?
It's that everybody could do it?

01:28:45.534 --> 01:28:50.504
What your sister does is not easy...

01:28:50.539 --> 01:28:54.499
but what we were planning to do...

01:28:54.543 --> 01:28:58.213
is not that difficult.

01:28:59.214 --> 01:29:00.974
Listen to me.

01:29:01.925 --> 01:29:07.385
Never speak on my behalf...

01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:13.480
about my business again.

01:29:15.439 --> 01:29:18.109
Now I have to go to California.

01:30:19.253 --> 01:30:20.553
Can I help you?

01:30:20.587 --> 01:30:22.587
I'm Joy. I'm here to see Gerhardt.

01:30:23.298 --> 01:30:24.758
He's not available.

01:30:25.968 --> 01:30:27.138
I'll wait.

01:30:30.597 --> 01:30:32.887
She says she's here to see Gerhardt.

01:30:33.851 --> 01:30:34.851
Gerhardt!

01:30:42.693 --> 01:30:44.783
Hey. I'm Gerhardt.

01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:46.320
I'm Joy.

01:30:46.363 --> 01:30:47.743
Come on in.

01:30:47.781 --> 01:30:49.201
Derek Markham is my boss.

01:30:49.241 --> 01:30:50.491
He lives in Texas.

01:30:50.534 --> 01:30:54.914
Fabri-Pac is one of several companies
he owns or collects royalties for.

01:30:54.955 --> 01:30:58.465
I report to him.
He makes pricing decisions.

01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:01.590
Well, I've never met or talked
to this Derek Markham...

01:31:01.628 --> 01:31:03.418
but I've talked to you many times
on the phone.

01:31:03.463 --> 01:31:05.013
And I do find it very curious...

01:31:05.048 --> 01:31:08.128
that the second I'm on television,
with a lot of success...

01:31:08.177 --> 01:31:10.597
the price for our products goes up.

01:31:10.637 --> 01:31:13.307
Seems very unfair to me,
to say the least.

01:31:14.016 --> 01:31:16.386
Seems like you're shaking us down.

01:31:16.435 --> 01:31:18.855
You met Gregory, our plant foreman.

01:31:18.896 --> 01:31:21.186
It's very hard for us to lower the cost
at this point.

01:31:21.690 --> 01:31:23.980
We're already losing a lot of money.

01:31:24.026 --> 01:31:27.196
How could that possibly be,
with the $500,000 that we've given you...

01:31:27.237 --> 01:31:29.527
on top of the
$50,000 of advance royalties...

01:31:29.573 --> 01:31:32.833
that have gone to a Derek Markham
in Dallas.

01:31:32.868 --> 01:31:35.118
And that's not even counting
what my sister paid you...

01:31:35.162 --> 01:31:36.832
without my authority, by the way...

01:31:36.872 --> 01:31:39.582
for your overcharges and your mistakes.

01:31:40.334 --> 01:31:43.924
Your sister paid the increase
that you refused to pay.

01:31:44.254 --> 01:31:48.094
Well, she had no authority to do that.
She's not an officer of my corporation.

01:31:49.092 --> 01:31:53.602
You and I could both spend a lot of time
and money in court to prove that I'm right...

01:31:54.765 --> 01:31:56.525
but that would just make
our lawyers wealthy...

01:31:56.558 --> 01:31:59.098
while my product dies
instead of being on television...

01:31:59.144 --> 01:32:00.944
like it could be right now.

01:32:02.022 --> 01:32:03.652
You can pay more.

01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:06.899
I can't pay more. I won't.

01:32:06.944 --> 01:32:09.864
Costs are higher.
Wear and tear on the molds.

01:32:09.905 --> 01:32:11.995
We have to remake them every other week.

01:32:12.032 --> 01:32:14.992
Is that so? Can I see the molds?

01:32:15.035 --> 01:32:16.575
They're in the machines.

01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:19.460
It'll take some time
to prepare them for you.

01:32:24.378 --> 01:32:26.378
Is there a bathroom I could use?

01:32:29.591 --> 01:32:31.891
Yeah, it's down the hall.
Gregory will show you.

01:32:40.102 --> 01:32:41.192
Thanks.

01:34:02.184 --> 01:34:03.314
What?

01:34:07.147 --> 01:34:08.687
What are you doing in here?

01:34:09.316 --> 01:34:10.726
What is this?

01:34:10.776 --> 01:34:13.776
These are my designs,
these are my molds!

01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:14.950
Those are ours!

01:34:14.988 --> 01:34:17.068
And we knew you'd be trouble.
The cops are on their way.

01:34:17.115 --> 01:34:19.365
- We called 'em as soon as you showed up!
- These are my molds!

01:34:19.409 --> 01:34:20.619
Those are ours!

01:34:20.661 --> 01:34:22.541
I'm taking these with me.

01:34:22.788 --> 01:34:24.118
I'm taking all of these with me.

01:34:24.164 --> 01:34:26.584
I want all of these boxed up,
and I'm taking them.

01:34:26.625 --> 01:34:27.885
You're trespassing!

01:34:27.918 --> 01:34:29.168
It's not your patent!

01:34:29.586 --> 01:34:31.496
These are my designs!

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:35.180
I'm not going anywhere without my molds.

01:34:36.093 --> 01:34:37.803
What? No. No.

01:34:37.845 --> 01:34:40.265
This is not stealing,
this is my property!

01:34:40.305 --> 01:34:41.555
This is my property.

01:34:41.598 --> 01:34:45.058
I have all of these designs.
These are all mine. They belong to me!

01:34:45.102 --> 01:34:48.862
She's from out of state, John!
You've known me 15 years!

01:34:48.897 --> 01:34:50.647
All right, come on, ma'am.
You're trespassing.

01:34:50.691 --> 01:34:52.401
- What?
- Yeah. Come on.

01:34:52.442 --> 01:34:53.942
- I'm not trespassing.
- Yeah, you're trespassing.

01:34:53.986 --> 01:34:55.106
I was in his office.

01:34:55.153 --> 01:34:56.653
- You don't know. Come on.
- He let me into his...

01:34:56.697 --> 01:34:58.197
Gerhardt, you're not gonna
get away with this.

01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.780
- You're not gonna get away with this!
- Be careful what you're saying.

01:34:59.825 --> 01:35:01.875
- You're a thief! You're a thief, Gerhardt!
- Be careful, come on, come on.

01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:03.240
Be careful. Come on, stop it.

01:35:03.287 --> 01:35:05.497
- This is stealing!
- Hey, hey, stop it. Come on.

01:35:05.539 --> 01:35:06.539
All right.

01:35:09.626 --> 01:35:11.586
Watch your step. All right.

01:35:19.636 --> 01:35:21.006
What about Trudy's money, Joy?

01:35:21.054 --> 01:35:23.184
You have to pay back Trudy's money.

01:35:23.223 --> 01:35:24.893
This is only getting worse.

01:35:24.933 --> 01:35:26.813
I predicted tragedy, Joy.

01:35:27.269 --> 01:35:29.309
You're racking up quite a steep bill.

01:35:29.354 --> 01:35:32.614
We had to fly out here, bail you out.

01:35:32.649 --> 01:35:35.779
Plus it cost us an extra $10,000
for Ray Cagney...

01:35:35.819 --> 01:35:38.319
this California patent attorney,
to get us to this point.

01:35:38.363 --> 01:35:40.993
We got the state to decline prosecution.

01:35:41.033 --> 01:35:43.243
They see it's a contract dispute.

01:35:43.285 --> 01:35:46.915
When you paid royalties
to Derek Markham in Texas...

01:35:46.955 --> 01:35:50.995
it put all your parts and molds
under the umbrella of their patent.

01:35:51.919 --> 01:35:55.169
I see you brought your drawings
and hung them to prove your design.

01:35:55.214 --> 01:35:57.844
But it's impossible to fight it now.

01:35:57.883 --> 01:36:00.343
You were not properly advised.

01:36:01.678 --> 01:36:03.178
Cristy, please!

01:36:03.222 --> 01:36:04.352
Tony, take her to bed.

01:36:04.389 --> 01:36:06.639
I don't wanna go to bed.
I wanna stay here.

01:36:06.683 --> 01:36:08.183
I paid those royalties...

01:36:08.227 --> 01:36:09.347
because you told me to.

01:36:09.394 --> 01:36:12.234
Because your lawyer told me to.

01:36:12.272 --> 01:36:16.152
Our lawyer was mistaken.
This happens sometimes in business.

01:36:16.193 --> 01:36:17.533
It didn't work out for you.

01:36:17.569 --> 01:36:18.739
It happens sometimes.

01:36:18.779 --> 01:36:20.239
Trudy's lawyer is not a patent attorney.

01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:21.740
Which I said!

01:36:21.782 --> 01:36:25.872
And you said I had no business
being Joy's advisor.

01:36:25.911 --> 01:36:27.791
- And now it turns out that I was right!
- This is not helpful, Tony!

01:36:27.829 --> 01:36:29.869
- That's enough, Tony. Please.
- It's enough, now?

01:36:29.915 --> 01:36:32.675
I'm very sorry.
I wish there was more I could do.

01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:35.919
But when your sister Peggy paid
the unjustified bills...

01:36:35.963 --> 01:36:37.803
that you refused to pay...

01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:39.420
it closed the door on that.

01:36:39.466 --> 01:36:41.296
What about Neil Walker and QVC?

01:36:41.343 --> 01:36:43.853
Wouldn't they pay the expenses
on defending the patent?

01:36:44.596 --> 01:36:45.716
Be careful, Joy.

01:36:45.764 --> 01:36:49.524
You could be sued for misrepresentation
and failure to deliver your product.

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:50.560
That's breach.

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:54.900
QVC requires that you deliver
a fully patented product.

01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:57.440
I've been doing this for a long time.

01:36:57.484 --> 01:37:01.574
You're in for a long court process
that will stall your product.

01:37:01.613 --> 01:37:03.203
And you will probably lose.

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:04.660
I wish I could do more.

01:37:06.285 --> 01:37:07.835
Take care, now.

01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:10.210
You're gonna have to accept
the facts, Joy.

01:37:10.247 --> 01:37:11.707
I mean, that's...

01:37:12.332 --> 01:37:14.422
You're most of half a million dollars
in debt.

01:37:14.459 --> 01:37:16.289
I don't know how you're gonna pay it.

01:37:16.628 --> 01:37:18.418
We have to declare bankruptcy.

01:37:18.463 --> 01:37:20.883
You're gonna have to declare bankruptcy.

01:37:21.258 --> 01:37:22.548
I have to declare bankruptcy.

01:37:22.593 --> 01:37:23.723
She has to.

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:25.300
- To try to contain my losses.
- Yeah.

01:37:25.345 --> 01:37:26.635
I have to write it off.

01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:28.720
It just seems so wrong.

01:37:28.765 --> 01:37:30.425
We've worked so hard.

01:37:30.475 --> 01:37:32.685
We've come so far
for us to just give up now.

01:37:32.728 --> 01:37:34.308
It just seems so unfair!

01:37:34.354 --> 01:37:36.984
Business is unfair. That's it.

01:37:37.024 --> 01:37:39.154
It's not working out.
Well, that's what happens.

01:37:39.193 --> 01:37:43.033
That's why people don't go around
making invention every other day.

01:37:43.071 --> 01:37:44.161
Wake up!

01:37:44.198 --> 01:37:45.318
It's my fault.

01:37:45.365 --> 01:37:48.275
I gave her the confidence to think she was
more than just an unemployed housewife...

01:37:48.327 --> 01:37:51.157
selling plastic kitchen stuff
to other unemployed housewives...

01:37:51.205 --> 01:37:52.415
on a junk cable channel.

01:37:52.456 --> 01:37:55.286
It's my fault.
It's not your fault, honey.

01:37:55.334 --> 01:37:57.974
It was my mistake to make her think
that she was more than she was.

01:37:58.378 --> 01:38:00.958
She pressured herself into doing
something she shouldn't have done.

01:38:01.006 --> 01:38:03.166
It was wrong of you
to put that pressure on yourself.

01:38:03.217 --> 01:38:05.547
It was wrong of us
to put that pressure on you.

01:38:05.594 --> 01:38:07.184
I need more vodka.

01:38:07.221 --> 01:38:12.981
It was wrong of us to think that you'd be
an instant business person overnight.

01:38:13.018 --> 01:38:15.558
Of course, this is not who you are.

01:38:16.522 --> 01:38:21.612
It takes a kind of toughness,
a certain acumen...

01:38:21.652 --> 01:38:24.452
that you simply don't have.

01:38:25.113 --> 01:38:26.453
Sign the paper.

01:38:30.994 --> 01:38:33.584
You have to sign
these bankruptcy papers, honey.

01:38:33.622 --> 01:38:36.172
The notary's right outside.
Let me get her.

01:38:40.170 --> 01:38:42.370
You're gonna have to move
out of your house immediately.

01:38:43.173 --> 01:38:44.893
You're gonna have to move
into an apartment.

01:38:45.342 --> 01:38:47.552
Maybe you can move into a room
in Trudy's house.

01:38:47.594 --> 01:38:48.854
With the children?

01:38:48.887 --> 01:38:50.257
Yeah. You have room.

01:38:51.181 --> 01:38:52.601
She's my daughter. Why not?

01:38:53.934 --> 01:38:55.524
Let's talk about it.

01:38:56.019 --> 01:38:57.649
Trudy, we have to offer her something.

01:38:57.688 --> 01:38:58.808
Again?

01:38:58.856 --> 01:39:00.066
Why me?

01:39:07.865 --> 01:39:09.455
Please sign, honey.

01:39:35.767 --> 01:39:36.887
Thank you.

01:39:40.647 --> 01:39:45.067
Mimi said you were the one born
to help carry the family to success.

01:39:48.572 --> 01:39:51.412
No, Cristy. Mimi was wrong.

01:39:52.826 --> 01:39:55.196
The world does not give you opportunities.

01:39:55.245 --> 01:39:59.995
The world destroys your opportunity
and it breaks your heart.

01:40:00.626 --> 01:40:04.376
I should have listened to my mother
when I was 10 years old.

01:40:04.421 --> 01:40:06.101
I should have spent the rest of my life...

01:40:06.131 --> 01:40:09.181
watching TV and hiding from the world
like my mother.

01:40:10.093 --> 01:40:12.683
So I don't wanna hear
any more about Mimi.

01:40:13.263 --> 01:40:14.433
She was wrong.

01:40:14.473 --> 01:40:18.063
She had her head in the clouds
and it was full of stupid ideas.

01:40:18.101 --> 01:40:20.271
And it gave me stupid ideas.

01:40:22.814 --> 01:40:23.824
Like this.

01:40:26.652 --> 01:40:28.822
This stupid, stupid idea!

01:40:31.782 --> 01:40:34.332
Mommy, don't tear them! No!

01:40:56.056 --> 01:40:58.346
Cristy, I'm so sorry.

01:40:58.392 --> 01:41:00.602
I'm sorry, Cristy.

01:41:00.644 --> 01:41:02.314
I'm so sorry.

01:41:02.354 --> 01:41:04.814
Please go to bed.
Everybody just go to bed.

01:41:06.191 --> 01:41:07.941
Good night, Mommy.

01:41:07.985 --> 01:41:10.155
Good night, sweetheart. Just go to bed.

01:41:12.739 --> 01:41:15.239
I'm so sorry I failed you, Joy.
I'm so sorry.

01:41:15.492 --> 01:41:17.082
Just, just don't.

01:42:48.752 --> 01:42:50.962
Joy? Joy?

01:42:51.630 --> 01:42:53.050
Joy, where are you?

01:42:55.050 --> 01:42:56.800
Joy, where are you?

01:44:10.501 --> 01:44:11.791
It's open.

01:44:19.551 --> 01:44:20.891
You can leave the door open.

01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:48.870
No one knows I'm here.

01:44:49.873 --> 01:44:52.003
You don't even know who I am.

01:44:52.042 --> 01:44:57.552
I could be Derek Markham or I might be
someone Derek Markham sent to handle you.

01:44:58.048 --> 01:45:00.048
You have no case.

01:45:00.551 --> 01:45:04.551
Maybe people think you came to Dallas
in despair to take your own life...

01:45:04.596 --> 01:45:09.556
because you were in such deep financial
trouble suddenly from your little venture.

01:45:16.233 --> 01:45:19.533
I made a phone call this morning
to Hong Kong.

01:45:20.195 --> 01:45:25.365
It was 1:00 a.m. in California but it was 5:00 p.m.
the following afternoon in Hong Kong.

01:45:25.409 --> 01:45:29.749
I always think it's amazing
how time works like that.

01:45:31.456 --> 01:45:34.706
And I was fortunate enough to get
on the phone with Mr. Christopher...

01:45:34.751 --> 01:45:37.921
who I found to be very friendly,
which was surprising...

01:45:37.963 --> 01:45:41.223
because I really haven't found the
gentlemen in California to be very nice...

01:45:41.258 --> 01:45:43.758
considering we're all
in business together.

01:45:43.802 --> 01:45:47.602
Welcome to the world of business,
I guess.

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:51.060
I told Mr. Christopher
that the reason that I was calling...

01:45:51.101 --> 01:45:55.111
was to discuss the differences
in the designs of our products.

01:45:55.772 --> 01:46:00.242
But I quickly learned
that Mr. Christopher has no idea...

01:46:00.277 --> 01:46:06.447
if his Hong Kong patent for a self-wringing
mop is worth anything or if it even works.

01:46:07.075 --> 01:46:12.115
Because they have not made
or sold a single mop.

01:46:12.414 --> 01:46:16.134
Unlike us, who have sold over 200,000.

01:46:17.252 --> 01:46:22.132
And I've paid you over $50,000
in advanced royalties...

01:46:22.174 --> 01:46:24.134
on behalf of Mr. Christopher.

01:46:24.676 --> 01:46:29.596
Blood money from my family
and my second mortgage.

01:46:30.849 --> 01:46:35.309
Turns out Mr. Christopher doesn't know
anything about those royalties.

01:46:35.354 --> 01:46:36.814
So it seems...

01:46:37.981 --> 01:46:41.611
we have a case of fraud and embezzlement.

01:46:44.655 --> 01:46:47.825
And, as if that weren't bad enough...

01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:54.330
I also discovered in the paperwork that
our mops actually don't bear any similarities.

01:46:54.373 --> 01:46:57.503
So I never did owe you
any royalties for your patent.

01:46:58.544 --> 01:47:00.504
That's another case of fraud.

01:47:01.171 --> 01:47:07.181
My lawyers really could go after you,
but I told them, "Give me a day."

01:47:07.219 --> 01:47:13.179
To see if maybe
you might've made a mistake...

01:47:15.018 --> 01:47:17.978
that you would correct,
given the chance.

01:47:33.370 --> 01:47:36.370
We'll pay you back all the royalties
you paid us.

01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:46.050
I'll give you $20,000
on top of paying you back the 50.

01:47:58.020 --> 01:47:59.230
Okay.

01:48:00.939 --> 01:48:04.689
I'll give you $50,000
on top of paying you back the 50.

01:48:16.747 --> 01:48:18.367
Plus interest.

01:48:23.795 --> 01:48:25.795
I want all of my molds back.

01:48:26.465 --> 01:48:28.765
I want you to sign
this piece of paper...

01:48:29.801 --> 01:48:33.101
saying that you have
no rights, financially.

01:48:34.097 --> 01:48:37.597
I'm just gonna add...
I said the 50...

01:48:39.728 --> 01:48:41.648
plus the 50...

01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:46.230
plus the interest.

01:48:46.276 --> 01:48:50.406
So I just want you to initial
next to those two numbers as well.

01:48:56.453 --> 01:48:57.953
So just sign there.

01:49:05.963 --> 01:49:08.473
She put up with just about anything.

01:49:09.466 --> 01:49:11.926
Until when she had to
bring the hammer down...

01:49:13.470 --> 01:49:15.140
she brought the hammer down.

01:49:17.474 --> 01:49:20.144
She couldn't know what was to come.

01:49:21.019 --> 01:49:25.109
That she'd go on to make
another 100 record-setting patents.

01:49:26.024 --> 01:49:29.744
Skinny velvet hangers
make neater closets.

01:49:29.778 --> 01:49:32.108
That's a big deal to a lot of people.

01:49:33.282 --> 01:49:35.702
I mean, who thinks of things like that?

01:49:36.869 --> 01:49:38.159
Joy did.

01:49:42.457 --> 01:49:47.667
She didn't know any of this would happen
as she walked down the street that day.

01:49:48.338 --> 01:49:52.468
Yes, sir, tonight's the night for
Ol' Saint Nick to make his yearly visit...

01:49:52.509 --> 01:49:54.639
to all the folks all over the world.

01:49:54.678 --> 01:49:58.308
There's fun and expectation
in every house across the land.

01:49:58.348 --> 01:50:02.438
And speaking of houses, what do you say
we take a little look-in on a typical one?

01:50:05.439 --> 01:50:10.989
Now I'll admit that what you see right now
is just a small piece of the front of the house...

01:50:11.028 --> 01:50:14.908
but all you grownups and kids alike,
this is the time for Santa's magic...

01:50:14.948 --> 01:50:18.158
so I think we can make it
become a real house.

01:50:19.036 --> 01:50:20.616
Even a house with love in it.

01:50:20.662 --> 01:50:23.712
Mr. Santa Claus, can we have
a little snow, please?

01:50:25.792 --> 01:50:27.712
Thank you. That's fine.

01:50:28.003 --> 01:50:32.053
Now, Santa, let me see what it
really looks like inside this house.

01:51:01.411 --> 01:51:05.921
She couldn't know that one day
she would move into a big beautiful home.

01:51:08.502 --> 01:51:10.752
Her mother was happy.

01:51:11.547 --> 01:51:15.877
She remained close to her,
and with the rest of her family...

01:51:15.926 --> 01:51:18.676
which was, as always, complicated.

01:51:20.848 --> 01:51:26.188
She would pay for products made by
Rudy, Trudy, and Peggy.

01:51:26.228 --> 01:51:28.268
Even when they failed.

01:51:28.939 --> 01:51:33.689
Even when they wrongly sued
for ownership of her company.

01:51:34.570 --> 01:51:39.280
As Rudy got older,
Joy continued to take care of him and love him.

01:51:45.122 --> 01:51:50.792
As Neil Walker predicted,
Joy did become a whole new business.

01:51:51.253 --> 01:51:53.343
And even outgrew QVC.

01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:55.340
- She's talking to her children.
- Is Tony in there?

01:51:55.424 --> 01:51:56.724
Yes, Tony's in there.
The family's in there.

01:51:56.967 --> 01:52:03.177
Her ex-husband and her best friend
would remain her steadfast advisers.

01:52:03.223 --> 01:52:04.563
Please be patient.

01:52:10.314 --> 01:52:12.614
I love you.
You guys go and pack your rooms.

01:52:12.649 --> 01:52:14.439
- Good night, Mom.
- I love you.

01:52:23.452 --> 01:52:24.702
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:52:24.745 --> 01:52:26.415
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

01:52:29.082 --> 01:52:30.292
What do you have?

01:52:30.334 --> 01:52:32.134
A traveling clothes cleaner.

01:52:32.169 --> 01:52:33.169
Let's see it.

01:52:34.129 --> 01:52:35.419
So you're from Memphis?

01:52:35.464 --> 01:52:36.804
Yes, I am.

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:38.130
You work as a waitress?

01:52:38.175 --> 01:52:39.475
Yes, ma'am.

01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:42.010
All right. Let's see it.

01:52:43.514 --> 01:52:44.814
You made this yourself?

01:52:44.848 --> 01:52:45.848
Yes, I did, ma'am.

01:52:46.850 --> 01:52:49.100
I made my first invention myself, too.

01:52:50.521 --> 01:52:52.521
I like this, it's a very good design.

01:52:52.773 --> 01:52:53.773
Thank you.

01:52:53.815 --> 01:52:56.315
Can you stay an extra day,
meet with our designers?

01:52:57.152 --> 01:52:58.362
No, because of your boss?

01:52:59.988 --> 01:53:01.908
What hotel are you staying in right now?

01:53:01.949 --> 01:53:03.659
- The Holiday Inn, ma'am.
- Holiday Inn.

01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:05.790
Let's move them over to the Radisson,
get them a suite.

01:53:05.827 --> 01:53:07.497
You'll be more comfortable
with your baby.

01:53:07.538 --> 01:53:10.458
I'll call your boss and get it taken care of,
give you an extra day...

01:53:10.499 --> 01:53:12.780
so that tomorrow you can come in,
meet with the designers.

01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:14.710
- We can take it step by step, all right?
- Thank you.

01:53:14.962 --> 01:53:16.762
We'll work on your idea,
see if we can do something.

01:53:16.797 --> 01:53:18.627
This means so much to me.

01:53:18.882 --> 01:53:20.382
I know what it feels like.

01:53:20.843 --> 01:53:22.893
I know what it feels like
to be in that chair.

01:53:23.554 --> 01:53:25.604
- We'll see you tomorrow, okay?
- Thank you, ma'am.

01:53:25.639 --> 01:53:26.889
And good luck.

01:53:27.182 --> 01:53:28.642
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

01:53:28.684 --> 01:53:31.394
- Go get the next person, Tony.
- Okay.

01:53:31.895 --> 01:53:32.895
Neil.

01:53:35.023 --> 01:53:37.153
Sorry, we have legal stuff
with Barry, now.

01:53:40.487 --> 01:53:41.907
Yes, we do.

01:53:43.323 --> 01:53:44.873
Here we are.

01:53:44.908 --> 01:53:46.078
Here we are.

01:53:47.703 --> 01:53:49.753
Adversaries in commerce.

01:53:50.581 --> 01:53:52.751
Adversaries in commerce.

01:53:53.917 --> 01:53:55.707
- And friends.
- Yes.

01:53:56.170 --> 01:53:57.380
And friends.

01:53:58.589 --> 01:54:01.259
I'm gonna tell you something
but you didn't hear it from me.

01:54:01.592 --> 01:54:03.842
I don't know who you are
or what you're talking about.

01:54:03.886 --> 01:54:05.506
That's what I wanted to hear.

01:54:07.264 --> 01:54:09.354
Barry's gonna come after you, hard.

01:54:09.391 --> 01:54:12.891
But that's just business.
That's the way Barry is. He's a negotiator.

01:54:12.936 --> 01:54:15.226
Ultimately, he needs you.

01:54:15.272 --> 01:54:18.572
He's buying HSN.

01:54:18.609 --> 01:54:21.949
It's all about HSN now,
and he wants you to come with him.

01:54:24.364 --> 01:54:25.914
He needs you.

01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:28.790
You're going to be very big over there.

01:54:29.286 --> 01:54:31.246
That's what's going to happen.

01:54:31.663 --> 01:54:34.463
But, you didn't hear it from me, right?

01:54:35.083 --> 01:54:39.253
No, I sure didn't.
But thank you.

01:54:42.591 --> 01:54:44.631
It's nice to see you.

01:54:44.676 --> 01:54:46.256
It's good to see you.

01:54:48.555 --> 01:54:50.715
I'll see you around, pal.

01:54:50.766 --> 01:54:52.726
Yeah.

01:54:59.900 --> 01:55:01.110
It's been a long journey.

01:55:01.151 --> 01:55:02.281
Yes, it has.

01:55:02.319 --> 01:55:03.449
I'm proud of you.

01:55:03.487 --> 01:55:04.697
Thank you, Neil.

01:55:38.856 --> 01:55:42.396
This right here,
this is a special power.

01:55:44.278 --> 01:55:46.148
This is a special power.

01:55:50.868 --> 01:55:54.158
And then I started
to build my very own house...

01:55:55.914 --> 01:55:58.674
where I would live
and make wonderful creations...

01:55:58.709 --> 01:56:02.049
for all the world to see and love.

01:56:07.718 --> 01:56:10.348
She didn't know any of this would happen...

01:56:10.387 --> 01:56:13.257
as she walked that day.
