WEBVTT

00:00.042 --> 00:03.250
Previously on "Below Deck
Sailing Yacht"...

00:03.250 --> 00:05.125
-Glenn!
-How are you?

00:05.125 --> 00:07.501
Hey sea doggy-dog!

00:07.501 --> 00:10.167
Last season we had some
communication errors

00:10.167 --> 00:11.459
between the different
departments.

00:11.459 --> 00:13.417
I didn't have a communication
problem,

00:13.417 --> 00:16.417
everyone else had a
communication problem.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.375
-Ashley.
-Ashley is a head turner.

00:18.375 --> 00:19.709
So we basically have the
same level of experience.

00:19.709 --> 00:21.334
Yeah.

00:21.334 --> 00:23.334
I definitely wanna be
a chief stew someday.

00:23.334 --> 00:25.334
I know I'm ----ing
good at what I do.

00:25.334 --> 00:27.042
Gabriela...

00:27.042 --> 00:28.250
[bleep]

00:28.250 --> 00:32.542
I usually go for, like,
28 to, like, 34.

00:32.542 --> 00:34.375
I don't just want to
jump to the first person

00:34.375 --> 00:36.417
that gives me attention.

00:36.417 --> 00:42.125
No, no, no, no, no.

00:42.125 --> 00:44.751
[vomiting]

00:44.751 --> 00:47.417
We got a charter tomorrow
and ----ing Tom is man down.

00:47.417 --> 00:49.918
That's never gonna happen again.

00:49.918 --> 00:52.501
First charter guests of
the season, McCordia Young.

00:52.501 --> 00:54.209
Whoo, baby.

00:54.209 --> 00:56.000
Mr. Chef, do you have
any other food left?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.083
You guys hungry, still?

00:57.083 --> 00:58.375
Yes.

00:58.375 --> 00:59.501
They definitely want
their money worth.

00:59.501 --> 01:01.083
Oh, sh--.

01:01.083 --> 01:03.042
-You are so sexy.
-Thank you.

01:03.042 --> 01:05.584
-Can I have one more drink?
-Are you sure?

01:05.584 --> 01:24.501
Come on, we're getting
a little inappropriate.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.459
You are so sexy.

01:26.459 --> 01:28.209
Okay, thank you.

01:28.209 --> 01:30.626
I don't like girls, but,
like, you sexy as [bleep].

01:30.626 --> 01:31.667
-Thank you.
-It's weird.

01:31.667 --> 01:33.042
Who you gonna [bleep] tonight?

01:33.042 --> 01:34.334
Nobody.

01:34.334 --> 01:35.709
That's--
Okay, come on.

01:35.709 --> 01:37.209
We're getting a little
inappropriate.

01:37.209 --> 01:38.709
Um, who are you interested in?

01:38.709 --> 01:40.167
Nobody.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.542
I'm really not.

01:41.542 --> 01:43.000
Don't bullsh-- me.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.334
I'm not!
I swear, I would tell you.

01:44.334 --> 01:46.042
I mean, the girls are
all really young,

01:46.042 --> 01:47.626
and Daisy's straight
as an arrow.

01:47.626 --> 01:49.375
So you like--
so you like that little--

01:49.375 --> 01:51.042
Women? I do.

01:51.042 --> 01:52.459
What do you guys do together?

01:52.459 --> 01:55.209
Oh, come on.
You have to go to bed.

01:55.209 --> 01:57.334
In my ten years of
high-end bartending,

01:57.334 --> 01:58.626
if I know how to do anything,

01:58.626 --> 02:00.417
it's how to talk
to drunk people.

02:00.417 --> 02:03.000
How to tell them
to [bleep] off super politely.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.209
Please go to bed now.

02:04.209 --> 02:05.292
Yeah, I'm going to bed.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.250
I still have a lot to clean up.

02:07.250 --> 02:08.417
Go ahead and do it.

02:08.417 --> 02:09.417
All right, see you
in the morning?

02:09.417 --> 02:10.584
-Thank you, sir?
-Sir?

02:10.584 --> 02:12.542
Good night.
You're welcome.

02:12.542 --> 02:15.459
Any time.

02:15.459 --> 02:20.667
That was ----ing weird.

02:20.667 --> 02:22.417
Chef's gonna get loose.

02:22.417 --> 02:24.417
Chef's gonna get loose, yeah.

02:24.417 --> 02:25.584
-And I work too much.
-Yeah.

02:25.584 --> 02:27.292
All right.
Well, I'm out.

02:27.292 --> 02:30.042
I don't think they got any
on the... in the mouth.

02:30.042 --> 02:31.501
First impressions count, right?

02:31.501 --> 02:33.959
So, my first impression
was sh--.

02:33.959 --> 02:35.459
I'm so tired.

02:35.459 --> 02:38.125
All I can do now is get to work
and turn this around.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.375
A little bit less talk and
a little bit more walk.

02:40.375 --> 02:43.250
Oh, fun, fun, fun.

02:43.250 --> 02:55.542
Ay-yi-yi.

02:55.542 --> 02:59.626
Where is my relief?

02:59.626 --> 03:10.542
Hello.

03:10.542 --> 03:12.417
Oh, good morning, Dais.

03:12.417 --> 03:14.083
-Morning.
-Marcos.

03:14.083 --> 03:15.250
-Dude, what up?
-Daisy?

03:15.250 --> 03:17.250
-Yes.
-What time do you serve?

03:17.250 --> 03:18.959
9:00? 8:00?

03:18.959 --> 03:20.918
We serve usually
just as they come up.

03:20.918 --> 03:23.125
-Okay. Okay.
-Um, if that's okay.

03:23.125 --> 03:26.375
So, I have smoked salmon,
cheese platter,

03:26.375 --> 03:29.417
bacon, fruit platter,
the Benedict.

03:29.417 --> 03:30.417
Think it's enough?

03:30.417 --> 03:31.667
I mean, it's hard to tell

03:31.667 --> 03:33.542
because they ate
a lot yesterday.

03:33.542 --> 03:35.459
-This is beautiful.
-It is nice.

03:35.459 --> 03:37.292
-That's why I'm prepping a lot.
-Yeah.

03:37.292 --> 03:39.292
These guests,
they have a big appetite.

03:39.292 --> 03:41.334
Daisy, I'm still
a little bit hungry.

03:41.334 --> 03:42.709
Some more steak or something.

03:42.709 --> 03:44.459
-You guys hungry, still?
-Yeah.

03:44.459 --> 03:46.000
It's so good.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.709
So, this morning I come out
with a plan

03:47.709 --> 03:52.083
to give a lot of food until
they say stop, basta.

03:52.083 --> 03:54.250
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

03:54.250 --> 03:55.626
How are you guys?

03:55.626 --> 03:57.125
-Question.
-Mm-hmm.

03:57.125 --> 03:58.292
Can we go ahead
and have breakfast?

03:58.292 --> 03:59.292
Yeah, of course.

03:59.292 --> 04:00.292
You want to take a seat?

04:00.292 --> 04:01.959
Yeah.

04:01.959 --> 04:03.375
And we'll let him--
I'll let the chef know.

04:03.375 --> 04:04.709
Been waiting for this
literally for a year,

04:04.709 --> 04:06.501
to be able to talk to my
boy in the morning.

04:06.501 --> 04:09.042
Only two guests are awake,
but they want to start eating,

04:09.042 --> 04:10.501
so I'm going to
start taking this up.

04:10.501 --> 04:11.751
Perfect.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.250
I am not falling today.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.709
I know we had a carpet.

04:15.709 --> 04:18.250
I just don't remember
where it was.

04:18.250 --> 04:21.250
He has made you a very
impressive spread.

04:21.250 --> 04:22.709
That looks amazing.

04:22.709 --> 04:24.209
-Everything is delicious.
-Everything is good.

04:24.209 --> 04:25.542
Aww sh--.

04:25.542 --> 04:27.417
What's the plan for today?

04:27.417 --> 04:29.417
-Beach party.
-Ah!

04:29.417 --> 04:32.083
Good Lord.

04:32.083 --> 04:33.626
Do you think you have everything
you need for a beach party?

04:33.626 --> 04:38.125
-Yeah.
-Excellent.

04:38.125 --> 04:39.501
-That was good.
-It's good?

04:39.501 --> 04:41.501
Somebody locked me in the laz.

04:41.501 --> 04:43.042
Uh, okay.

04:43.042 --> 04:46.959
You can push that up,
it's not dogged.

04:46.959 --> 04:49.709
Oh, oh, I got it.
I got it.

04:49.709 --> 04:53.167
I got it, false alarm.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.417
What time did he go down?
6:00?

04:54.417 --> 04:55.792
6:30, I think.

04:55.792 --> 04:57.083
So how was all that?

04:57.083 --> 05:03.417
[bleep], done good, eh?

05:03.417 --> 05:08.209
Yeah.

05:08.209 --> 05:09.292
Excellent.

05:09.292 --> 05:10.542
Come on and sit down and eat.

05:10.542 --> 05:12.125
-Toolbox meeting.
-Toolbox meeting.

05:12.125 --> 05:13.626
If one of you guys wants
to go jump in the tender

05:13.626 --> 05:15.000
to go have a look
at this beach.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.334
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

05:16.334 --> 05:18.042
-How are you?
-Good. You're up early.

05:18.042 --> 05:19.292
Did they got to bed early?

05:19.292 --> 05:21.292
I told him to go to bed.

05:21.292 --> 05:23.000
Why?
'Cause he was ----ing drunk?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.584
He was getting a little
inappropriate, and I was like,

05:24.584 --> 05:26.083
"Okay, you need to go
to bed."

05:26.083 --> 05:27.918
-[laughs]
-Okay, Glenn. I'm all clear.

05:27.918 --> 05:30.167
Hey.

05:30.167 --> 05:31.751
Oh, my God, girl.

05:31.751 --> 05:34.667
See, you wanted to be on nights!

05:34.667 --> 05:41.334
But, you know,
I'm used to this.

05:41.334 --> 05:42.584
One cabin's done.

05:42.584 --> 05:44.375
Ashley, are you finished
in the master?

05:44.375 --> 05:46.542
I'm almost done with the bed.
I need more... stuff.

05:46.542 --> 05:49.042
Oh, okay. So, maybe you
can go down with her

05:49.042 --> 05:50.209
to help her do that bed.

05:50.209 --> 05:51.667
I can do that.

05:51.667 --> 05:54.125
And then you can get all
your stuff ready for picnic.

05:54.125 --> 05:56.584
Vamanos.
Breakfast is done.

05:56.584 --> 05:58.626
Glenn, Gary.
It's pretty busy already.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.125
If we're going to do
this beach setup,

06:00.125 --> 06:01.792
I suggest we do it
as soon as possible.

06:01.792 --> 06:04.542
I'm happy for you to shoot
back here

06:04.542 --> 06:07.083
and grab chairs and go in
and stake a claim.

06:07.083 --> 06:09.626
Yeah, roger.

06:09.626 --> 06:11.250
I hope I didn't offend
you last night.

06:11.250 --> 06:13.334
-No.
-Okay, good.

06:13.334 --> 06:15.792
-I mean, you did not offend me.
-Good, okay, cool.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.417
You know, when I was like,

06:17.417 --> 06:18.542
"Hey, let's keep it
professional"

06:18.542 --> 06:19.709
-Cool.
-You did.

06:19.709 --> 06:20.751
That's all I ask.

06:20.751 --> 06:22.459
Thank you for bringing it up.

06:22.459 --> 06:24.584
I used to bartend at
a strip club in Miami.

06:24.584 --> 06:25.584
Oh-- oh, my God.

06:25.584 --> 06:27.501
-Okay?
-Oh, my God.

06:27.501 --> 06:31.083
You are nothing compared to what
I've seen and dealt with, okay?

06:31.083 --> 06:32.292
Good morning.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.083
-Eggs benedict.
-Thank you.

06:34.083 --> 06:35.417
-Hey, girl.
-Hey.

06:35.417 --> 06:37.167
What's the plan for today?

06:37.167 --> 06:39.042
I think a beach picnic.

06:39.042 --> 06:40.459
Yay.

06:40.459 --> 06:42.417
An afternoon sail, and
then dinner this evening.

06:42.417 --> 06:44.626
-Pajama jam?
-Yeah, exactly.

06:44.626 --> 06:46.250
Would you like to go
to the beach a bit earlier,

06:46.250 --> 06:48.417
like, 1:00, and
then food at 2:00?

06:48.417 --> 06:52.334
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

06:52.334 --> 06:55.626
Eggs benedict is really good.

06:55.626 --> 06:57.459
Me either.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.209
-Hey, babe, real quick.
-Yeah.

06:59.209 --> 07:02.584
Uh, for the hospital corners,
um, you did them right,

07:02.584 --> 07:06.042
but you did them where the
seam was facing the door.

07:06.042 --> 07:08.667
Do it where the flap covers,
so it goes this way.

07:08.667 --> 07:11.125
-Okay.
-So, just inverted.

07:11.125 --> 07:12.792
Okay.

07:12.792 --> 07:16.000
There's definitely more than
one way to do a hospital corner.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Just do it horizontally,

07:18.000 --> 07:21.083
but turn it over because the
word Parsifal is on that side.

07:21.083 --> 07:23.542
I don't think I'm gonna need
much guidance this season.

07:23.542 --> 07:25.501
Thanks but no thanks.

07:25.501 --> 07:27.292
I'm gonna go start
the other cabin.

07:27.292 --> 07:29.125
That won't take me very long
if you want

07:29.125 --> 07:31.083
to start pulling your stuff
for the picnic.

07:31.083 --> 07:32.417
I can load that if you want,
if you want to go change.

07:32.417 --> 07:33.751
Okay.

07:33.751 --> 07:35.751
They are gonna go to
the beach at 1:00,

07:35.751 --> 07:37.667
and lunch is going
to be at 2:00.

07:37.667 --> 07:39.083
Are you gonna take
Kelsie with you?

07:39.083 --> 07:40.083
-Yeah.
-Cool.

07:40.083 --> 07:41.751
That's a good idea.

07:41.751 --> 07:45.083
I'm just gonna do barbecue ribs,
jerk chicken, potato salad.

07:45.083 --> 07:48.000
So just kind of space the stuff
out as much as you can.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.501
Now, I'm just wondering,
do you want me there?

07:49.501 --> 07:51.542
-No, I think we'll be fine.
-Yeah?

07:51.542 --> 07:54.042
And-- but I'll send Ashley over
with the food then

07:54.042 --> 07:56.250
-...at a quarter to two.
-Okay.

07:56.250 --> 07:59.501
I want Daisy to feel like she
can depend on me as her second,

07:59.501 --> 08:01.334
but the thing is,
is that I've only done like

08:01.334 --> 08:03.459
two beach picnics in my life.

08:03.459 --> 08:05.459
You-- you feel confident
you can do it.

08:05.459 --> 08:07.042
-Water, wine...
-Yeah.

08:07.042 --> 08:08.626
I am a fake it till you
make it type of bitch.

08:08.626 --> 08:11.542
So, we'll do lunch service,
no big deal.

08:11.542 --> 08:13.083
I got this.

08:13.083 --> 08:16.709
-Cheers.
-Okay.

08:16.709 --> 08:18.417
-You okay with that?
-Oh, yeah.

08:18.417 --> 08:22.459
-You sure?
-Yeah.

08:22.459 --> 08:29.626
Cool, this looks good.

08:29.626 --> 08:31.292
Okay. Can I help
with anything here?

08:31.292 --> 08:33.000
Yeah. That stuff
and all the cushions

08:33.000 --> 08:34.292
and stuff in the bridge.

08:34.292 --> 08:36.000
Radio me if you need anything.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.667
Cheers to Spain.

08:37.667 --> 08:40.000
[overlapping dialogue]

08:40.000 --> 08:42.083
And more to come,
more to come.

08:42.083 --> 08:44.417
Uh, Gabriela's gone to
the beach to do the setup,

08:44.417 --> 08:47.167
and then you're gonna
go with the food.

08:47.167 --> 08:49.250
-Okay.
-It's pretty straightforward.

08:49.250 --> 08:50.584
-Okay, let's do this.
-Let's get to it.

08:50.584 --> 08:54.584
I'm gonna give you these towels.

08:54.584 --> 08:56.167
Do you need anything
from me now or no?

08:56.167 --> 08:57.751
No.

08:57.751 --> 08:59.417
Well, the next thing
I'm coming with is the guests.

08:59.417 --> 09:01.334
Okay. I figured they could look
out at the pretty view.

09:01.334 --> 09:02.417
Oh, you're right.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.501
We need lots of flowers

09:04.501 --> 09:06.334
otherwise it's not gonna
be, like, heavy enough.

09:06.334 --> 09:09.167
These placemats are definitely
not gonna stay on the table.

09:09.167 --> 09:10.542
You in gear?

09:10.542 --> 09:12.542
-Yeah.
-You ready?

09:12.542 --> 09:14.292
-I'm ready.
-Okay.

09:14.292 --> 09:17.209
That's the thing about yachting
that makes it difficult,

09:17.209 --> 09:20.584
is not the guests,
not living on a boat.

09:20.584 --> 09:22.501
It's the ----ing elements.

09:22.501 --> 09:25.626
All right, we're gonna use the
rocks to hold sh-- down.

09:25.626 --> 09:27.459
The deck crew are ready for you
to take you over to the beach.

09:27.459 --> 09:28.459
-Okay.
-Thank you.

09:28.459 --> 09:29.501
We're ready.

09:29.501 --> 09:31.125
I'm not hating the rocks.

09:31.125 --> 09:32.125
They don't look as
bad as I thought.

09:32.125 --> 09:33.459
I'm excited to get off.

09:33.459 --> 09:35.083
He's in charge
of us now, Daisy?

09:35.083 --> 09:37.000
Oh, you're in--
you're in good hands.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.042
You sure?

09:38.042 --> 09:39.042
Eh...

09:39.042 --> 09:41.250
[laughter]

09:41.250 --> 09:45.250
Is Marcos making,
like, big platters or--

09:45.250 --> 09:46.250
[gasps]

09:46.250 --> 09:47.334
[laughs]

09:47.334 --> 09:49.083
Yes.

09:49.083 --> 09:51.083
Put those on the ends
of the table.

09:51.083 --> 09:54.584
To say it plainly, the beach
picnic is a ----ing mess.

09:54.584 --> 09:56.209
This is nowhere near ready.

09:56.209 --> 09:58.626
I have, like,
three minutes to organize it

09:58.626 --> 09:59.709
and make it look nice.

09:59.709 --> 10:01.334
Jokes on me, Daisy.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.542
Oh, they're here.

10:02.542 --> 10:03.542
[bleep] off.
Are you kidding me?

10:03.542 --> 10:05.375
Oh, my God.

10:05.375 --> 10:07.083
Then we're not gonna
set up the canopy, I'm sure.

10:07.083 --> 10:08.542
Throw all this sh--
on the table.

10:08.542 --> 10:10.000
I'm gonna look like an asshole.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.584
Coming up...

10:11.584 --> 10:12.959
We're heeled over
quite a bit now.

10:12.959 --> 10:14.959
Ooh.

10:14.959 --> 10:16.167
We are sailing.

10:16.167 --> 10:19.667
Watch out!

10:19.667 --> 10:19.667
[screaming]
Oh, my God!

10:19.667 --> 10:25.083
Previously on "Below Deck
Sailing Yacht"...

10:25.083 --> 10:26.584
Oh, they're here.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.584
[bleep] off,
are you kidding me?

10:28.584 --> 10:30.083
It's as good as it's gonna get.

10:30.083 --> 10:31.250
There is a little
gust right now.

10:31.250 --> 10:33.459
Oh, we got our girl, Gabby.

10:33.459 --> 10:35.542
-Oh, Lord.
-Wave, y'all.

10:35.542 --> 10:39.250
I'm just gonna distract the
guests from this ----ing mess.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.959
Would you like some
more champagne?

10:40.959 --> 10:43.083
So, I know the table's
not super elaborate,

10:43.083 --> 10:44.417
but the most important thing--

10:44.417 --> 10:46.417
It looks beautiful.
Don't say--

10:46.417 --> 10:47.751
Is that it doesn't blow away.

10:47.751 --> 10:49.584
I'll go pick up Ash
and come back.

10:49.584 --> 10:50.959
And I'll bring Tom so
you guys can swap out

10:50.959 --> 10:52.667
-so you can go on a break.
-Okay.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.417
How are we feeling
about mimosas?

10:54.417 --> 10:55.584
I'll actually have another one.

10:55.584 --> 10:57.083
Yeah.

10:57.083 --> 10:58.667
-Tender's back.
-Yeah. Take it.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.209
You want me to start plating?

11:00.209 --> 11:01.667
Yeah.

11:01.667 --> 11:03.584
Were you okay with
the boat this morning? I just--

11:03.584 --> 11:05.083
-Yeah, it looked good.
-All right.

11:05.083 --> 11:06.250
He's plating
the salmon right now.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.751
Yeah.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.417
Here's to a great lunch,
a beautiful island,

11:10.417 --> 11:12.292
and to my 43rd birthday.

11:12.292 --> 11:14.459
Lots of laughs and
a lot of bullsh--.

11:14.459 --> 11:16.125
Whoo!

11:16.125 --> 11:19.000
All right, let's do this.
Keep going.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.125
-Hi!
-I come bearing lunch.

11:21.125 --> 11:23.792
Oh, good.
They're so hungry.

11:23.792 --> 11:26.125
-Enjoy your beach picnic, guys.
-Thank you!

11:26.125 --> 11:29.334
So, we'll tell them
what it is, offer them,

11:29.334 --> 11:32.250
serve each one from the left.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.083
[sighs]

11:34.083 --> 11:36.459
Okay, Ms. Melody, can I offer
you some potato salad?

11:36.459 --> 11:39.042
-Yeah.
-This looks amazing, yeah.

11:39.042 --> 11:41.417
Oh, my God,
this salmon is...

11:41.417 --> 11:43.083
Jerk chicken?
Barbecue ribs?

11:43.083 --> 11:46.542
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

11:46.542 --> 11:48.375
Yeah.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.334
-[speaking Spanish]
-Yeah, brother.

11:50.334 --> 11:52.083
You gonna knock their
socks off tonight, or what?

11:52.083 --> 11:54.751
Yeah.
Lobster, ribeye.

11:54.751 --> 11:56.125
I have to make a birthday cake.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.501
-Get that big tip!
-Oh, yeah.

11:58.501 --> 12:00.667
So where is your family?

12:00.667 --> 12:02.501
I haven't been home in
five years, man.

12:02.501 --> 12:03.709
That's not that much.

12:03.709 --> 12:06.125
-Me? Twenty.
-It's been twenty years?

12:06.125 --> 12:07.459
Yeah.

12:07.459 --> 12:10.125
I can travel anywhere
around the world.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.459
The only place
I cannot go is Venezuela.

12:12.459 --> 12:14.125
Why can't you go to Venezuela?

12:14.125 --> 12:17.292
Because I am a refugee,
like political asylum.

12:17.292 --> 12:20.542
Back in Venezuela I used
to cook for the president.

12:20.542 --> 12:22.292
He was a dictator.

12:22.292 --> 12:27.083
Whoever was working with him and
then quit, you become a target.

12:27.083 --> 12:28.667
I was scared.

12:28.667 --> 12:31.125
Did a lot of your friends
and family do that with you?

12:31.125 --> 12:32.292
Just me.

12:32.292 --> 12:34.667
I left because I realized

12:34.667 --> 12:38.292
that I'm gonna die
at one point, you know?

12:38.292 --> 12:42.417
I realized that--

12:42.417 --> 12:44.334
[sniffs]

12:44.334 --> 12:46.417
Do you consider yourself, like,
one of the lucky ones that--

12:46.417 --> 12:47.709
Yeah.

12:47.709 --> 12:51.209
Some of them,
they didn't make it.

12:51.209 --> 12:53.501
Because-- because they
couldn't get the visa, or--

12:53.501 --> 12:55.167
No, because they got killed.

12:55.167 --> 12:58.125
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

12:58.125 --> 13:02.751
My Mom, I just miss her.

13:02.751 --> 13:04.542
-It's no joke.
-Yeah, man.

13:04.542 --> 13:06.459
My grandma, my brother,
and my sisters,

13:06.459 --> 13:09.417
everyone, we tried
to get back together.

13:09.417 --> 13:12.417
We love each other.
We text each other.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.751
It's just been hard for us
to get together.

13:14.751 --> 13:16.709
So, when I have
issues or problems,

13:16.709 --> 13:22.000
I remember where I used to live.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.667
[bleep]
That's pretty heavy, bro.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.626
Yes.

13:25.626 --> 13:27.334
Gary, do you want to come
back and pick up the guests?

13:27.334 --> 13:29.167
-Uh, yeah, copy.
-Did you see the fish?

13:29.167 --> 13:30.459
This is perfect.

13:30.459 --> 13:37.292
[laughs]

13:37.292 --> 13:38.375
You're so young.

13:38.375 --> 13:39.459
What do you mean I'm so young?

13:39.459 --> 13:40.626
You're the same age as me.

13:40.626 --> 13:42.459
-No, I'm a year older.
-No.

13:42.459 --> 13:44.125
You just don't know how
to drink, that's the problem.

13:44.125 --> 13:46.083
No. I ----ed up on
the first night, fair enough,

13:46.083 --> 13:47.167
but it's a good
laugh, isn't it?

13:47.167 --> 13:48.667
I can be mature.

13:48.667 --> 13:49.959
I just don't choose to be
mature all the time

13:49.959 --> 13:51.584
when it's not my personality.

13:51.584 --> 13:55.375
It's almost like she just wants
me to be like more boring.

13:55.375 --> 14:00.334
So, even if a guy is
like super, super hot,

14:00.334 --> 14:03.501
you won't date him if he's not
the age group that you like?

14:03.501 --> 14:05.834
Oh, my God.

14:05.834 --> 14:08.834
Shut the [bleep] up.

14:08.834 --> 14:10.334
Yes.

14:10.334 --> 14:11.667
Are we gonna move once
they all come back?

14:11.667 --> 14:13.083
I believe so.

14:13.083 --> 14:15.334
Try to find a bit of shelter.

14:15.334 --> 14:17.334
That's me done for the week.

14:17.334 --> 14:19.459
-Yeah.
-[laughter]

14:19.459 --> 14:23.709
Ooh, it's cold now.

14:23.709 --> 14:25.292
What'd you guys think?
Smooth ride or what?

14:25.292 --> 14:27.125
-Yeah.
-We're back!

14:27.125 --> 14:29.209
Just be careful there,
it's a little wet and slippery.

14:29.209 --> 14:30.584
-Okay.
-Did you have a nice time?

14:30.584 --> 14:31.584
We had a blast.

14:31.584 --> 14:32.751
Do I look okay in this shirt?

14:32.751 --> 14:34.209
I like the pink.

14:34.209 --> 14:36.292
But you and Gary
both look good in it.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.584
Great.

14:37.584 --> 14:39.626
-They loved every dish.
-For real?

14:39.626 --> 14:45.709
Yeah, they loved it.

14:45.709 --> 14:47.209
-Marcos smashed it.
-Smashed it.

14:47.209 --> 14:49.042
Yeah.

14:49.042 --> 14:56.250
I'm ready to go.

14:56.250 --> 14:58.292
Hey, Glenn, Glenn,
I'm starting to lift the anchor.

14:58.292 --> 14:59.626
Thanks, Mate.

14:59.626 --> 15:05.626
Are we going sailing?

15:05.626 --> 15:11.417
Anchor's home.
Anchor's home.

15:11.417 --> 15:12.626
I'll, um, I don't know
if it'll be that,

15:12.626 --> 15:14.375
-but I'll have him--
-Okay.

15:14.375 --> 15:15.667
Prepare something.

15:15.667 --> 15:17.501
-Okay, let's get ready to sail.
-Yeah.

15:17.501 --> 15:21.417
Hey, Cheffy, um, they want
some form of a little snack.

15:21.417 --> 15:22.709
She asked if we had any
more of the--

15:22.709 --> 15:24.334
Did you just say they
wanted snacks?

15:24.334 --> 15:25.375
-They wanted snacks.
-I thought they were full.

15:25.375 --> 15:26.375
For how many people?

15:26.375 --> 15:29.125
All six, or--

15:29.125 --> 15:31.042
Okay.

15:31.042 --> 15:32.667
One thing you're never
gonna hear me say is,

15:32.667 --> 15:34.167
"No, we can't do that."

15:34.167 --> 15:35.292
How?

15:35.292 --> 15:37.459
Am I happy about this?
No.

15:37.459 --> 15:40.125
But we're gonna keep it moving.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.292
-I'll be 15 minutes.
-All right.

15:42.292 --> 15:43.959
Thank you.

15:43.959 --> 15:46.792
Uh, we will, but it's not
gonna heel too hard.

15:46.792 --> 15:48.125
We're gonna go sailing.

15:48.125 --> 15:50.125
Captain, you are
cool as sh--.

15:50.125 --> 15:52.250
So this is our lazy sheet
or our windward sheet.

15:52.250 --> 15:54.167
Yeah.

15:54.167 --> 15:55.334
So, what we've got to do,
is we've got to pull this out.

15:55.334 --> 15:56.834
The lazy sheet isn't the sail?

15:56.834 --> 15:59.083
-No, this is a sheet.
-This is a sheet.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.792
A sheet is what you use
to pull in a sail.

16:00.792 --> 16:02.250
-Oh, okay.
-Got it.

16:02.250 --> 16:03.334
So you sheet in or
sheet out to sail.

16:03.334 --> 16:04.834
Yeah.

16:04.834 --> 16:06.167
But because this sheet
doesn't do anything--

16:06.167 --> 16:07.292
-Yeah.
-It's a lazy sheet.

16:07.292 --> 16:08.834
Right, okay.

16:08.834 --> 16:10.375
-I was wondering why you call...
-You see, it's a--

16:10.375 --> 16:11.501
...where the
terminology's coming form.

16:11.501 --> 16:13.417
Yeah, okay.
Come on, Tom.

16:13.417 --> 16:15.125
-That makes sense now.
-Okay.

16:15.125 --> 16:16.542
-Yeah, that's good stuff.
-Took a while, gosh.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.375
The wind is light and fluky.

16:18.375 --> 16:20.667
-Fluky?
-Fluky.

16:20.667 --> 16:22.042
What's fluky?

16:22.042 --> 16:23.459
Fluky is, you know,
non-reliable.

16:23.459 --> 16:25.000
Like it keeps changing.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.626
-All over the place?
-Fluky.

16:26.626 --> 16:28.250
See it's--
Fluky or looky?

16:28.250 --> 16:29.292
I say fluky.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.626
Like, "fl"?

16:30.626 --> 16:32.000
I like Kelsie.
She's very positive.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.250
Fluky.

16:33.250 --> 16:36.501
I like fluky,
it sounds like dookie.

16:36.501 --> 16:39.250
But she's a bit weird.

16:39.250 --> 16:41.167
So, let's go up on main.

16:41.167 --> 16:44.417
Interior, interior galley,
we are gonna get some sails up.

16:44.417 --> 16:46.751
We're gonna be heeling
to starboard at first.

16:46.751 --> 16:49.083
Okay. Glenn, you've got
three wraps left.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.501
-Daisy.
-What is this?

16:50.501 --> 16:52.042
-Duck.
-Duck.

16:52.042 --> 16:54.334
-Teriyaki and green sauce.
-Okay, hold.

16:54.334 --> 16:55.709
Okay.
Call the mizzen.

16:55.709 --> 16:57.501
This is the biggest sail
I've ever seen.

16:57.501 --> 16:59.334
And hold.

16:59.334 --> 17:00.375
Genny?

17:00.375 --> 17:02.083
This is teriyaki
and ginger duck.

17:02.083 --> 17:03.501
-Whoo!
-Oh, duck?

17:03.501 --> 17:05.584
-All right.
-Yeah, hold.

17:05.584 --> 17:06.584
Okay.

17:06.584 --> 17:07.584
Wow.

17:07.584 --> 17:09.292
This is amazing.

17:09.292 --> 17:12.125
Sh--.

17:12.125 --> 17:13.584
Okay.

17:13.584 --> 17:14.626
The breeze is back now.

17:14.626 --> 17:17.167
-Unreal.
-Yeah.

17:17.167 --> 17:18.751
It's starting to tilt.
It's tilting.

17:18.751 --> 17:21.083
We're going sideways,
like, more, I can feel it.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.083
Ooh, Michael Jackson, bitch.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.501
-Secure everything.
-Sh--!

17:24.501 --> 17:28.417
----ers!

17:28.417 --> 17:29.751
The cake is the most important.

17:29.751 --> 17:31.542
I don't care about the rest.

17:31.542 --> 17:34.501
I need ample notification
when we're gonna heel this hard.

17:34.501 --> 17:35.542
Ugh.

17:35.542 --> 17:37.501
Jesus, Gary, ----ing come on.

17:37.501 --> 17:41.042
We're sailing.
We are sailing.

17:41.042 --> 17:42.417
Ooh.

17:42.417 --> 17:43.751
Oh!

17:43.751 --> 17:43.751
-Oh, my God.
-Ooh ooh!

17:43.751 --> 17:50.417
Oh, they're here.

17:50.417 --> 17:54.334
This joint is leaning, y'all.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.167
-Ooh.
-Oh!

17:56.167 --> 17:57.542
-Oh, my God.
-Sh--.

17:57.542 --> 17:58.709
-Ooh ooh!
-What was that?

17:58.709 --> 18:00.083
-Sh--.
-Are you okay though?

18:00.083 --> 18:04.250
Can we please stop
heeling so hard?

18:04.250 --> 18:05.626
Yeah.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.417
Well, don't nobody
put their feet down.

18:07.417 --> 18:09.375
-Ooh.
-Pinch up a little bit.

18:09.375 --> 18:10.709
We're heeled over
quite a bit now.

18:10.709 --> 18:12.375
No one's hurt or
anything, are they?

18:12.375 --> 18:14.334
-No, we're fine.
-Just a little embarrassed.

18:14.334 --> 18:15.667
[laughing]

18:15.667 --> 18:18.542
That was a big, big lift,
like 15 degrees.

18:18.542 --> 18:21.167
I mean, you know,
sh-- happens. You deal with it.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.501
We can always
make more drinks.

18:22.501 --> 18:25.167
It's not gonna
stop me from sailing.

18:25.167 --> 18:27.167
Just be prepared for it,
be ready for it.

18:27.167 --> 18:28.667
-I am so sorry.
-No.

18:28.667 --> 18:31.125
Honestly, it's not
your fault at all.

18:31.125 --> 18:32.501
I didn't actually expect
that we were...

18:32.501 --> 18:34.501
-Gonna heel this hard, so...
-Okay.

18:34.501 --> 18:35.501
It's kind of our fault.

18:35.501 --> 18:36.834
I'm like this.

18:36.834 --> 18:40.501
Eww!

18:40.501 --> 18:44.417
-You wanna take the wheel?
-Sure.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.209
Yeah.
You could climb 55.

18:46.209 --> 18:49.292
Whoo! Here we go.

18:49.292 --> 18:52.876
Ooh!

18:52.876 --> 18:56.792
Watch out! Watch out!

18:56.792 --> 19:04.209
What's that?
Are you okay, Dais?

19:04.209 --> 19:05.709
Daisy's got a nice ass,
and I think

19:05.709 --> 19:07.834
she's expecting everyone
to kiss it, so--

19:07.834 --> 19:10.375
Sorry, I didn't realize we were
gonna heel over too much either.

19:10.375 --> 19:11.375
There was wind out there.

19:11.375 --> 19:13.334
[kissing sounds]

19:13.334 --> 19:15.626
The whole table's smashed,
so there's glass everywhere.

19:15.626 --> 19:17.125
Okay.

19:17.125 --> 19:18.417
-How you doing?
-All right, how you doing?

19:18.417 --> 19:22.083
-Can I, like, like, steer?
-Absolutely.

19:22.083 --> 19:24.459
-That's pretty good, eh?
-Yeah.

19:24.459 --> 19:25.751
Oh, my God, this is so cool.

19:25.751 --> 19:27.542
Now you're sailing a superyacht.

19:27.542 --> 19:30.709
-You know, you a pimp.
-I-- [laughs].

19:30.709 --> 19:33.751
You a pimp.

19:33.751 --> 19:35.375
Gary, Gary, Gary, Glenn,

19:35.375 --> 19:36.542
whenever you're ready
to call the main,

19:36.542 --> 19:39.334
I'm gonna drop her.

19:39.334 --> 19:42.542
Okay. Stand by to drop
starboard, and you can drop now.

19:42.542 --> 19:48.501
-Drop, drop, drop.
-C
opy on the half.

19:48.501 --> 19:50.083
Long stay, 12:00.

19:50.083 --> 19:54.542
This is nice.
This is very pretty.

19:54.542 --> 19:57.167
And I think we'll do,
like, fancy, like,

19:57.167 --> 20:00.167
maybe do black and
gold for the dinner,

20:00.167 --> 20:04.792
and then the whole hip hop
theme at the top.

20:04.792 --> 20:06.417
[sighs]

20:06.417 --> 20:08.501
Maybe table dÃ©cor
can be your thing.

20:08.501 --> 20:10.250
-I hated it at the beginning.
-What?

20:10.250 --> 20:12.626
But now, I'm getting
better at it.

20:12.626 --> 20:15.542
I'm definitely not the most
artistic person ever.

20:15.542 --> 20:17.292
Do you like the
textured one more than--

20:17.292 --> 20:21.375
I do.
I think it looks fancier.

20:21.375 --> 20:23.542
As long as it's not laundry
or getting bossed

20:23.542 --> 20:25.334
around by Gabriela,
I'll ----ing take it.

20:25.334 --> 20:27.334
Oh, cool, it looks amazing.

20:27.334 --> 20:29.250
-Good job, Ash.
-Yeah, good job.

20:29.250 --> 20:30.667
How's your sh--?

20:30.667 --> 20:32.250
Going good.

20:32.250 --> 20:37.751
-You're too organized, mate.
-Non-stop.

20:37.751 --> 20:40.083
So, are you going
to breakdance?

20:40.083 --> 20:41.417
No. I wish I could breakdance.

20:41.417 --> 20:42.751
I would laugh, and
that would make my night.

20:42.751 --> 20:45.417
Whoo!
Whoo, looking good ladies.

20:45.417 --> 20:46.751
Thank you.

20:46.751 --> 20:48.250
Chef, they're about to
sit down.

20:48.250 --> 20:49.709
The birthday girl
get in the middle.

20:49.709 --> 20:52.250
-Galley copy.
-Happy birthday!

20:52.250 --> 20:54.876
Here, I took a bunch.

20:54.876 --> 20:57.375
-They look hungry?
-What do you think?

20:57.375 --> 20:59.375
Normally, multi-course
dishes are made

20:59.375 --> 21:03.209
of small portions to satisfy you
for a long period of time.

21:03.209 --> 21:06.250
But these guests,
they can't stop eating.

21:06.250 --> 21:07.459
She's gonna help us.

21:07.459 --> 21:08.834
Okay, you can go.

21:08.834 --> 21:11.209
So, tonight I'm
gonna make sure each dish

21:11.209 --> 21:12.667
have a lot of food in it.

21:12.667 --> 21:15.292
We have grilled octopus,
roasted peppers.

21:15.292 --> 21:16.792
Okay.

21:16.792 --> 21:19.292
And a gochujang aioli which
is a Korean spicy sauce.

21:19.292 --> 21:21.125
Thank you.

21:21.125 --> 21:22.792
Oh, you think I'm done?
You're gonna beg me to stop.

21:22.792 --> 21:24.125
-This is good.
-Mm-hmm.

21:24.125 --> 21:25.459
This is delicious.

21:25.459 --> 21:27.667
You can take them.

21:27.667 --> 21:30.584
So, what we have here
is a roasted beetroot salad

21:30.584 --> 21:35.042
with mango, goat cheese,
and a raspberry vinaigrette.

21:35.042 --> 21:36.584
I should go with those two?

21:36.584 --> 21:37.834
Yeah, of course.

21:37.834 --> 21:39.167
What?

21:39.167 --> 21:41.626
Cucumber carpaccio with
chorizo

21:41.626 --> 21:44.751
and lobster salad with
cherry tomatoes.

21:44.751 --> 21:46.417
Wow.

21:46.417 --> 21:47.709
I cannot believe how
much they're eating.

21:47.709 --> 21:49.334
I knew this was gonna happen.

21:49.334 --> 21:50.667
Lobster is just so amazing.

21:50.667 --> 21:52.501
[laughter]

21:52.501 --> 21:55.334
So we have fettuccine
made of zucchini,

21:55.334 --> 21:58.334
and I cooked the ribeye
with a tiki masala sauce.

21:58.334 --> 21:59.584
Nice.

21:59.584 --> 22:02.584
Amazing, yes!

22:02.584 --> 22:07.250
-Uno mas.
-Thank you.

22:07.250 --> 22:09.167
I am so full.

22:09.167 --> 22:10.667
I'm full too, but I'm still
eating this damn lobster.

22:10.667 --> 22:14.125
Meet up at the fly bridge
at 11:15 for pajamas.

22:14.125 --> 22:20.501
Cool, cool.

22:20.501 --> 22:21.626
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

22:21.626 --> 22:22.709
What do you want him to wear?

22:22.709 --> 22:24.542
-He can be naked.
-Okay.

22:24.542 --> 22:26.667
-He's gonna go up in his boxers.
-Oh, okay.

22:26.667 --> 22:29.751
Tommy boy, the birthday
girl would like you

22:29.751 --> 22:32.792
to go up shirtless
and in your boxers.

22:32.792 --> 22:34.167
Yeah, he can do that.

22:34.167 --> 22:35.375
Why me?

22:35.375 --> 22:37.667
I'm not Zac ----ing Efron.

22:37.667 --> 22:39.626
I'm Tom from the
north of England.

22:39.626 --> 22:42.125
We need a layer of fat
to keep us warm

22:42.125 --> 22:43.501
'cause it's so ----ing cold.

22:43.501 --> 22:45.709
-Oh.
-I'm so sorry.

22:45.709 --> 22:47.250
I'm so sorry.

22:47.250 --> 22:49.501
Well, let's put some
cream on my nipples.

22:49.501 --> 22:52.250
[laughter]

22:52.250 --> 22:55.292
You going shirtless?

22:55.292 --> 22:56.709
Do it.
Take one for the team.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.209
Somebody order
a dad bod?

22:59.209 --> 23:01.751
[laughing]

23:01.751 --> 23:03.709
We are ready for
guys up in the fly bridge.

23:03.709 --> 23:05.167
Okay.

23:05.167 --> 23:06.375
Dais, do we light it?

23:06.375 --> 23:08.375
-Yeah, light it.
-Light it. Light it.

23:08.375 --> 23:10.042
[snores]
Ah!

23:10.042 --> 23:11.459
Come on, y'all.

23:11.459 --> 23:14.209
It's gonna be chilly
up here, watch.

23:14.209 --> 23:19.083
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

23:19.083 --> 23:20.584
[shouting]

23:20.584 --> 23:25.626
[cheering]

23:25.626 --> 23:29.250
[shouting]

23:29.250 --> 23:32.083
How sweet!

23:32.083 --> 23:34.167
All right, good job.
Good job.

23:34.167 --> 23:35.584
This is amazing.

23:35.584 --> 23:37.667
Thank you so much.

23:37.667 --> 23:38.709
Look at captain!
Look at captain!

23:38.709 --> 23:41.083
Look at his pants!

23:41.083 --> 23:43.334
[laughter]

23:43.334 --> 23:46.375
[shouting]

23:46.375 --> 23:48.542
-Hey!
-That's unreal.

23:48.542 --> 23:49.709
-You got it.
-We got it.

23:49.709 --> 23:51.375
-You sure?
-Yeah, we got it.

23:51.375 --> 23:52.792
-No, I think you need more.
-We got it.

23:52.792 --> 23:55.584
-No, we got it.
-We've got some cake.

23:55.584 --> 23:57.167
Ahh!
My God!

23:57.167 --> 23:58.834
Who is licking that?

23:58.834 --> 24:01.167
No, I know who's
gonna lick it!

24:01.167 --> 24:03.125
Go ahead.

24:03.125 --> 24:05.125
Ahh!

24:05.125 --> 24:06.334
Can I do it?

24:06.334 --> 24:07.542
Uh-oh, there you go,
there you go.

24:07.542 --> 24:10.125
Whoo!

24:10.125 --> 24:11.209
[laughter]

24:11.209 --> 24:12.209
Coming up...

24:12.209 --> 24:13.334
We all have flaws.

24:13.334 --> 24:14.501
What are our bad qualities?

24:14.501 --> 24:17.167
I think, like, my
main, like, is--

24:17.167 --> 24:19.292
What is it?

24:19.292 --> 24:20.584
I don't know.
I'm perfect.

24:20.584 --> 24:27.584
Well, listen, I can
have an attitude.

24:27.584 --> 24:28.792
Ahh!

24:28.792 --> 24:30.542
Who's gonna lick it?

24:30.542 --> 24:32.876
-Can I do it?
-There you go, there you go.

24:32.876 --> 24:38.792
-[cheering]
-Whoo!

24:38.792 --> 24:43.042
[shouting]

24:43.042 --> 24:46.209
Hopefully that makes a good tip.

24:46.209 --> 24:48.292
-That was good.
-That was hilarious.

24:48.292 --> 24:50.375
-They're good people, huh?
-Yeah, they're awesome.

24:50.375 --> 24:51.667
All right, I'm outta here.

24:51.667 --> 24:53.083
-Goodnight, Glenn.
-Goodnight.

24:53.083 --> 24:54.417
Do you need a hand here,
Cheffy, or--

24:54.417 --> 24:56.250
-Maybe you should go to bed.
-No, no, no.

24:56.250 --> 24:57.584
I can't leave this.

24:57.584 --> 24:58.751
Well, what time are you up at?

24:58.751 --> 25:00.334
5:30.

25:00.334 --> 25:03.751
-Yeah, like every morning, eh?
-----ing hell.

25:03.751 --> 25:05.250
Hey, Dais, see you
in the morning.

25:05.250 --> 25:06.751
Yeah.

25:06.751 --> 25:09.375
Oh, we're ready,
we're ready for the battle.

25:09.375 --> 25:11.209
You got the robot,
you got the robot.

25:11.209 --> 25:13.334
[cheering]

25:13.334 --> 25:14.876
Ah, geez, flush the toilet.

25:14.876 --> 25:16.584
[laughs]

25:16.584 --> 25:18.542
-Can you do the worm?
-Just don't break your face.

25:18.542 --> 25:23.667
[cheering]

25:23.667 --> 25:28.501
-What time is it?
-It's 1:00 a.m.

25:28.501 --> 25:30.626
It's our last night, Mel.

25:30.626 --> 25:32.417
I'm tired.

25:32.417 --> 25:33.417
Ah.

25:33.417 --> 25:35.083
Mother----er.

25:35.083 --> 25:37.083
I'm going to bed, y'all.
I gotta pee anyway.

25:37.083 --> 25:39.709
Oh sh--.

25:39.709 --> 25:42.083
There's sh-- everywhere.

25:42.083 --> 25:45.584
-Thank you so much.
-Goodnight.

25:45.584 --> 25:48.584
Tom, Tom, I'm turning off
my radio and going to bed.

25:48.584 --> 25:49.667
Goodnight.

25:49.667 --> 26:04.876
Goodnight, sleep well.

26:04.876 --> 26:08.417
-Always.
-Always.

26:08.417 --> 26:13.584
Yeah.

26:13.584 --> 26:15.542
-Morning.
-Morning.

26:15.542 --> 26:17.292
Yes.

26:17.292 --> 26:19.125
Yeah.

26:19.125 --> 26:21.375
It's the last meal of the
charter, and I need to smash it.

26:21.375 --> 26:22.751
I'm gonna do a brunch,
buffet style,

26:22.751 --> 26:25.584
and I'm gonna put so
much food on that table,

26:25.584 --> 26:28.417
there is no way they're gonna
leave this boat ----ing hungry.

26:28.417 --> 26:30.584
-Morning, brother.
-Morning.

26:30.584 --> 26:31.876
Good morning.
You don't drink coffee?

26:31.876 --> 26:37.209
-Unh-unh.
-No?

26:37.209 --> 26:38.709
Oh, you're naughty.

26:38.709 --> 26:43.209
I can't wait for you
to have a shot of tequila.

26:43.209 --> 26:45.083
All right.

26:45.083 --> 26:47.542
Not since I went up there last.

26:47.542 --> 26:49.334
-Morning, Dais.
-Plan for today.

26:49.334 --> 26:51.167
Yeah, so brunch at 11:00,

26:51.167 --> 26:53.834
pick up anchor at about 12:00
and get on the dock at 2:00.

26:53.834 --> 26:55.334
Great.

26:55.334 --> 26:57.334
So we can start setting
up for brunch now.

26:57.334 --> 27:00.250
Daisy and Gary are working
a lot better

27:00.250 --> 27:02.209
this season then
they did last season.

27:02.209 --> 27:03.417
Yeah, I think they're
all super lovely.

27:03.417 --> 27:05.292
-Mm.
-Whatever, Gary.

27:05.292 --> 27:07.918
If you send out positive vibes,
you'll get positive vibes back.

27:07.918 --> 27:09.834
-I'm always positive.
-Whatever.

27:09.834 --> 27:11.459
They're both quite stubborn,

27:11.459 --> 27:12.918
but they're both very
good at their jobs,

27:12.918 --> 27:14.417
and I don't really
wanna lose that.

27:14.417 --> 27:16.876
I want them to keep that going.

27:16.876 --> 27:19.792
13 dishes for the brunch, okay?

27:19.792 --> 27:21.834
-So, what's happening tonight?
-I don't know.

27:21.834 --> 27:22.834
Getting on it, mate.

27:22.834 --> 27:26.209
[laughter]

27:26.209 --> 27:28.501
I see you ----ing flirting
around with Ashley.

27:28.501 --> 27:29.709
No, I'm not!

27:29.709 --> 27:34.209
What?

27:34.209 --> 27:35.751
Why don't you just
give it a week?

27:35.751 --> 27:39.417
I'm going to give it two weeks.

27:39.417 --> 27:42.209
I'm gonna enjoy what goes down
no matter what.

27:42.209 --> 27:45.250
-I gotta live vicariously.
-Yes, yes.

27:45.250 --> 27:47.584
-Morning.
-Hi, Daisy.

27:47.584 --> 27:49.334
-How are you?
-Excellent.

27:49.334 --> 27:50.584
-Are you coffee, or--
-Yes, coffee.

27:50.584 --> 27:51.918
-Coffee.
-Morning.

27:51.918 --> 27:54.709
-Yeah, thank you.
-Apple juice?

27:54.709 --> 27:57.709
-This is living.
-Yeah. No. I so agree.

27:57.709 --> 27:59.417
So, two people are sat down.

27:59.417 --> 28:00.584
I just thought I'd start
bringing stuff up slowly.

28:00.584 --> 28:02.167
Yeah.

28:02.167 --> 28:03.250
-Do you need a hand, Dais?
-Yeah, thanks.

28:03.250 --> 28:04.751
You look pretty.

28:04.751 --> 28:06.626
And comfortable.

28:06.626 --> 28:08.626
So, here we have
some smoked salmon,

28:08.626 --> 28:10.792
watermelon and feta salad.

28:10.792 --> 28:13.125
Okay.
We're gonna pack this up.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.250
-Don't you look pretty.
-Thank you.

28:15.250 --> 28:16.584
You look like a Skittle.

28:16.584 --> 28:18.584
-I look like a Skittle?
-Taste the rainbow.

28:18.584 --> 28:19.918
Last meal, it has to be good.

28:19.918 --> 28:22.167
Oh, my God.
It's so delicious.

28:22.167 --> 28:24.751
-Enjoy, guys.
-Thank you!

28:24.751 --> 28:27.292
-What?
-Oh, good morning.

28:27.292 --> 28:29.501
Gary, Gary, Glenn.
We're gonna start lifting.

28:29.501 --> 28:31.209
-Copy.
-[bleep] yeah.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.584
Ow.

28:32.584 --> 28:41.542
Watch your head.

28:41.542 --> 28:43.167
Glenn, Glenn,
anchor's home, anchor's home.

28:43.167 --> 28:45.626
Copy that, thank you.

28:45.626 --> 28:47.751
I'm gonna take a shower
so I can finish packing up.

28:47.751 --> 28:49.292
But this really is beautiful.

28:49.292 --> 28:50.542
Look at that though.

28:50.542 --> 28:52.334
We said we were gonna
get the fenders

28:52.334 --> 28:53.626
and blow them up and
they're gonna be on the dock.

28:53.626 --> 28:54.834
One of us can
get the door ready,

28:54.834 --> 28:56.626
and start getting
fenders and lines.

28:56.626 --> 28:58.334
I think it's interesting because
we're still sort

28:58.334 --> 29:00.292
of figuring out the boat,
and then--

29:00.292 --> 29:01.375
I know.

29:01.375 --> 29:02.584
I'm like, I don't know how--

29:02.584 --> 29:03.584
what you want or
what you wanna--

29:03.584 --> 29:06.542
Hip hop Tom, the stanky leg.

29:06.542 --> 29:08.375
If you wanna go down there,
I'll do this.

29:08.375 --> 29:10.292
I'd like you down there
to keep an eye on him.

29:10.292 --> 29:11.876
So, we're gonna be side
to for the whole season,

29:11.876 --> 29:13.417
which is quite a relief for us.

29:13.417 --> 29:15.209
The fundamentals of
docking a boat side to,

29:15.209 --> 29:16.751
you need a bow line
and you need a stern line.

29:16.751 --> 29:18.709
You need an off-running spring
and a fore-running spring.

29:18.709 --> 29:21.125
Whether it's a 20-foot boat
or a 500-foot boat,

29:21.125 --> 29:22.667
it's all pretty much the same.

29:22.667 --> 29:24.334
[whistles]

29:24.334 --> 29:26.834
Don't ever hang fenders
over until we're there.

29:26.834 --> 29:30.250
It looks bad, and we don't
know where they're gonna go.

29:30.250 --> 29:32.501
We need to also rinse down
the side of the hull

29:32.501 --> 29:34.626
before we put fenders on
because it's all salty.

29:34.626 --> 29:36.709
-Okay.
-I don't know where anything is.

29:36.709 --> 29:38.292
I don't know
what anything's called

29:38.292 --> 29:40.626
'cause all
the slang's different.

29:40.626 --> 29:41.626
Tom--

29:41.626 --> 29:43.792
Not getting any water.

29:43.792 --> 29:45.250
Oh, [bleep] off.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.584
Is there a twist
in it somewhere?

29:46.584 --> 29:48.709
I'm scared
I'm gonna look stupid.

29:48.709 --> 29:50.709
Everyone's setting me up
to fail here.

29:50.709 --> 29:55.083
No direction ----ing
from anywhere.

29:55.083 --> 29:57.584
I'm just guessing,
and that is pissing me off.

29:57.584 --> 29:59.125
Okay, guys, can we
do these fenders?

29:59.125 --> 30:00.626
Get these lined up.

30:00.626 --> 30:02.125
We need to line
the fenders up with this one

30:02.125 --> 30:03.334
and that one there.

30:03.334 --> 30:04.542
Once we get the
fenders positioned,

30:04.542 --> 30:06.167
let's get the aft-going spring,

30:06.167 --> 30:07.501
because we're getting
blown back a little bit.

30:07.501 --> 30:08.584
Come back a bit more then,
is that fine?

30:08.584 --> 30:10.292
Yeah, that's fine.

30:10.292 --> 30:11.751
You're just gonna have
to tie

30:11.751 --> 30:13.667
your forward-going spring
onto rings.

30:13.667 --> 30:15.417
I'll jump off and then do you
mind just checking these ones?

30:15.417 --> 30:17.292
These might just
require a slide, yeah.

30:17.292 --> 30:19.667
About two meters, Glenn.

30:19.667 --> 30:20.792
Take up all the slack.

30:20.792 --> 30:22.501
Yeah, take up all the slack.

30:22.501 --> 30:24.125
Kelsie, check these fenders.

30:24.125 --> 30:25.334
I can't see if
they're in position.

30:25.334 --> 30:26.667
Take that off?

30:26.667 --> 30:28.250
Ease us back in, but we
want this to be tight.

30:28.250 --> 30:28.250
You want me to let off a bit?

30:28.250 --> 30:41.250
Ahh!

30:41.250 --> 30:43.626
Okay, let's get the bow line on.

30:43.626 --> 30:48.792
Pick up all the slack, and
you can make it off on the bit.

30:48.792 --> 30:50.292
Take that slack, Tom.

30:50.292 --> 30:51.876
Tom, Tom, take that slack,
take that slack.

30:51.876 --> 30:54.834
Pull it in.
Okay, get that on the bits.

30:54.834 --> 30:56.834
-You guys happy?
-I'm happy.

30:56.834 --> 30:59.667
I'm coming out of gear.

30:59.667 --> 31:00.667
Main engine's off.

31:00.667 --> 31:01.751
Well done.

31:01.751 --> 31:02.834
It was the worst docking ever.

31:02.834 --> 31:04.417
-Good job.
-Thanks.

31:04.417 --> 31:05.667
-Good docking.
-I dunno.

31:05.667 --> 31:07.417
It was a bit--

31:07.417 --> 31:08.792
Why?

31:08.792 --> 31:10.083
I thought that went
quite smoothly.

31:10.083 --> 31:11.209
Okay, got you.

31:11.209 --> 31:12.459
Okay, what else?

31:12.459 --> 31:15.167
-I think that's that.
-Sailing tricks.

31:15.167 --> 31:17.751
Bye boat,
so long, farewell.

31:17.751 --> 31:20.501
Boat crew, let's get
everybody on the dock, please.

31:20.501 --> 31:22.334
Oh, my God,
we did it, Gary.

31:22.334 --> 31:23.834
Thank you so much.

31:23.834 --> 31:27.542
-Of course.
-Bye!

31:27.542 --> 31:28.792
You know I love you.

31:28.792 --> 31:30.375
Thank you so
much for everything.

31:30.375 --> 31:32.375
Your food was so good!

31:32.375 --> 31:34.167
-Thanks, Captain G!
-Thanks, man.

31:34.167 --> 31:37.417
We just wanted to say, the
service, absolutely amazing.

31:37.417 --> 31:38.834
Tom, thanks for the party!

31:38.834 --> 31:40.542
Yes, Tom.
Thank you so much.

31:40.542 --> 31:44.542
Marcos, I cannot tell you
how much we appreciated you.

31:44.542 --> 31:46.292
If the food is right,
everything is right.

31:46.292 --> 31:48.584
Thank you.
That means a lot to me.

31:48.584 --> 31:50.292
Yes.
Here's from us.

31:50.292 --> 31:51.667
-Oh, thank you. Thank you.
-We appreciate all of you.

31:51.667 --> 31:52.751
That's very kind of you.

31:52.751 --> 31:55.792
Have a safe trip home, huh?

31:55.792 --> 32:00.667
You guys keep waving.

32:00.667 --> 32:02.542
[horn blowing]

32:02.542 --> 32:05.751
[laughter]

32:05.751 --> 32:08.417
All right, well done, gang.
Let's go count this cash.

32:08.417 --> 32:13.751
Yeah.

32:13.751 --> 32:15.375
Oh, this one's a little dirty.

32:15.375 --> 32:20.125
Yeah. You see, so,
this one's quite bad.

32:20.125 --> 32:22.292
[laughs]

32:22.292 --> 32:24.250
All crew, all crew,

32:24.250 --> 32:27.167
can I get everybody together
in the saloon for a tip meeting?

32:27.167 --> 32:28.626
Can I sit next to you?

32:28.626 --> 32:29.751
Sure.

32:29.751 --> 32:31.167
I only smell a little bit.

32:31.167 --> 32:33.334
Me too.

32:33.334 --> 32:35.083
Cool.
What a fantastic charter, huh?

32:35.083 --> 32:36.501
-Wasn't that great?
-Yeah, definitely.

32:36.501 --> 32:38.375
Marcos, the mention you got
from the guests

32:38.375 --> 32:40.083
obviously is warranted,

32:40.083 --> 32:42.250
and that says a lot about
your culinary skills.

32:42.250 --> 32:44.083
Thank you, Captain.
Thanks.

32:44.083 --> 32:46.542
As far as the interior, you guys
kept the drinks going nonstop.

32:46.542 --> 32:48.709
-They did a good job.
-Yeah, so good job.

32:48.709 --> 32:51.209
The department heads, the way
you guys are handling yourself,

32:51.209 --> 32:53.292
especially the way you
guys are working together.

32:53.292 --> 32:54.626
I still hate doing dishes,

32:54.626 --> 32:56.542
but if it keeps
Daisy off my back,

32:56.542 --> 32:58.709
I'm gonna put my stew face on

32:58.709 --> 33:00.459
and I'm gonna be happy
and do it.

33:00.459 --> 33:02.167
And that brings us to the tip.

33:02.167 --> 33:05.792
We received $17,600.

33:05.792 --> 33:08.167
$1955 each.

33:08.167 --> 33:10.584
-Whoo!
-Yes!

33:10.584 --> 33:12.417
This is what we are here for.

33:12.417 --> 33:14.667
Where's the strip club?

33:14.667 --> 33:17.751
As for tonight's plans,
I want you to go and have fun.

33:17.751 --> 33:20.626
Uh, Tom, you know, I walk,
a very fine line,

33:20.626 --> 33:23.626
and that first night I was
walking a superfine line.

33:23.626 --> 33:25.834
Tom had a little issue,
but the next morning,

33:25.834 --> 33:30.292
you seemed no worse for wear,
and that's kind of what I need.

33:30.292 --> 33:31.584
Pace yourselves, please.

33:31.584 --> 33:32.876
We got a long time to go.

33:32.876 --> 33:34.334
I'm on redemption night tonight.

33:34.334 --> 33:35.709
-Yeah.
-All right.

33:35.709 --> 33:36.667
Salud!

33:36.667 --> 33:38.209
[cheering]

33:38.209 --> 33:40.167
I kept forgetting
to clean the day head,

33:40.167 --> 33:41.542
and that's the last thing
we need to do.

33:41.542 --> 33:44.792
Oh, [bleep], okay.

33:44.792 --> 33:49.209
Oh, right in the shoe.

33:49.209 --> 33:53.584
Oh, no, that's gross.

33:53.584 --> 33:56.250
-Is that it, guys?
-Yeah, let's go.

33:56.250 --> 34:00.918
We should just call it a night.

34:00.918 --> 34:01.918
I never look in a mirror, bro.

34:01.918 --> 34:03.375
Don't ----ing lie to me.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.918
I'm being serious, bro.

34:04.918 --> 34:10.542
They're not high enough.

34:10.542 --> 34:11.876
Psssh.

34:11.876 --> 34:13.250
Oh, that's cute.

34:13.250 --> 34:14.375
Know the secret, Colin?

34:14.375 --> 34:15.667
Never too much.

34:15.667 --> 34:17.709
Calm down with that stuff,
it stinks.

34:17.709 --> 34:19.751
I smell divine.

34:19.751 --> 34:21.584
-Have fun, huh?
-Thank you.

34:21.584 --> 34:23.542
-You look lovely, Dais.
-Thanks.

34:23.542 --> 34:27.292
It takes a year, girl.

34:27.292 --> 34:28.584
Can you see the difference?

34:28.584 --> 34:30.626
What?
On you?

34:30.626 --> 34:32.417
-Yeah, of course.
-No. Not on me.

34:32.417 --> 34:33.542
What happened, and what did
you do with the old Daisy?

34:33.542 --> 34:35.417
-Not on me.
-On me?

34:35.417 --> 34:38.626
No, I'm joking. I know.

34:38.626 --> 34:40.334
So I wasn't being
a massive bitch.

34:40.334 --> 34:41.792
It actually helps to help.

34:41.792 --> 34:43.292
No, I never-- I never
called you a massive bi--

34:43.292 --> 34:47.542
I called you a little--
No, I'm joking.

34:47.542 --> 34:49.375
Okay, guys, are
we ready to rock and roll?

34:49.375 --> 34:52.584
-You look hot, Daisy.
-Thanks!

34:52.584 --> 34:59.292
It doesn't happen too often,
but when it does--

34:59.292 --> 35:01.334
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:01.334 --> 35:02.834
What are you talking about?

35:02.834 --> 35:09.876
What does that even mean?

35:09.876 --> 35:11.292
Yeah, I'm a pee-er.

35:11.292 --> 35:12.709
Yeah, baby, let's go.

35:12.709 --> 35:13.709
[bleep] yeah.

35:13.709 --> 35:14.792
Best night ever!

35:14.792 --> 35:16.375
Shall we?

35:16.375 --> 35:18.375
Hey, guys.

35:18.375 --> 35:23.918
[speaking Spanish]

35:23.918 --> 35:25.584
Okay.

35:25.584 --> 35:27.584
You lived in Panama.
I lived in Boca del Toro.

35:27.584 --> 35:29.125
I've been on and off there
for like two years.

35:29.125 --> 35:30.751
Shut up!
Okay, I love Panama.

35:30.751 --> 35:32.250
I have the coordinates
tattooed here.

35:32.250 --> 35:34.209
Yeah, Panama.
Of Boca del Toro.

35:34.209 --> 35:35.250
-Gracias.
-Cheers.

35:35.250 --> 35:38.125
-Cheers, guys!
-Cheers!

35:38.125 --> 35:39.918
Great charter, good money!

35:39.918 --> 35:42.626
Hopefully, I don't turn
out like Tom tonight.

35:42.626 --> 35:45.125
I set the bar for myself
pretty low that night.

35:45.125 --> 35:46.751
If we stick to beer,
we're gonna be fine.

35:46.751 --> 35:50.375
I promise you, me on beer
is better than me and mixing.

35:50.375 --> 35:52.751
I need to prove to Ashley

35:52.751 --> 35:56.542
I'm not a complete twat
or some sort of child.

35:56.542 --> 35:58.417
She probably is more mature
than me, but that's fine,

35:58.417 --> 36:00.417
maybe I can bring
out her fun side.

36:00.417 --> 36:03.125
What a weird social
experiment yachting is, eh?

36:03.125 --> 36:04.375
-Not really.
-It's normal for me.

36:04.375 --> 36:05.792
It's weird.

36:05.792 --> 36:07.584
Think about your first job,
your first yachting job.

36:07.584 --> 36:10.292
My first yachting job,
it was easy.

36:10.292 --> 36:12.626
Okay, Marcos, you know what?

36:12.626 --> 36:15.292
-[bleep] you.
-Never mind, bitch.

36:15.292 --> 36:17.626
If you guys have been working
on boats with cool people

36:17.626 --> 36:19.209
that you get on with,

36:19.209 --> 36:20.626
then y'all have been
privileged and blessed.

36:20.626 --> 36:22.375
-Oh, yeah, I have.
-Because I haven't.

36:22.375 --> 36:24.667
I'm super intense and
I come on way too strong,

36:24.667 --> 36:26.542
because I wanna weed
out the people that

36:26.542 --> 36:28.250
I don't wanna [bleep] with.

36:28.250 --> 36:29.751
And that's not a flaw,
it's just the way I am.

36:29.751 --> 36:31.209
I agree.

36:31.209 --> 36:32.501
There's a lot of
sh--ty boats out there.

36:32.501 --> 36:33.834
And we all have flaws.

36:33.834 --> 36:35.334
What are our bad qualities?

36:35.334 --> 36:37.626
I think, like, my main,
like as a--

36:37.626 --> 36:41.459
What is it?

36:41.459 --> 36:43.125
I don't know, I'm perfect.

36:43.125 --> 36:44.459
I can have an attitude.

36:44.459 --> 36:51.125
I can have an attitude,
but it only comes out...

36:51.125 --> 36:52.584
Especially with myself.

36:52.584 --> 36:53.876
You weren't impatient with
me yesterday

36:53.876 --> 36:55.584
when all of our flowers
were blowing away.

36:55.584 --> 36:57.417
It was like, I don't get it,
[bleep] it, oh!

36:57.417 --> 37:02.751
What did I do to deserve this?

37:02.751 --> 37:04.584
I'm in a position where I'm
the third stew right now,

37:04.584 --> 37:05.834
so I'm bottom of the barrel,

37:05.834 --> 37:07.626
but I know there's been
a few things

37:07.626 --> 37:11.667
where I think I've done things
better and known more.

37:11.667 --> 37:13.667
I ----ing hate
small talk, Daisy.

37:13.667 --> 37:15.959
I ----ing hate
the surface bullsh--.

37:15.959 --> 37:28.792
I'm not gonna try
to like, change.

37:28.792 --> 37:32.751
It's hard to be fake.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.334
Coming up...

37:35.334 --> 37:37.334
Can I just say one thing?

37:37.334 --> 37:39.417
How is that [bleep] for you?
'Cause you're single as [bleep].

37:39.417 --> 37:41.709
It just feels patronizing.
That's just bullsh--.

37:41.709 --> 37:43.626
I made a mistake.
I'm not a ----ing child.

37:43.626 --> 37:51.209
Sounds good.

37:51.209 --> 37:52.959
Cheers.
Vamanos.

37:52.959 --> 37:55.250
So when we get back to the boat,
Daisy's getting in the jacuzzi.

37:55.250 --> 37:56.834
-Jacuzzi party.
-Taxi!

37:56.834 --> 37:58.834
There's a ----ing mosquito
flying around right here.

37:58.834 --> 38:00.667
Oh!

38:00.667 --> 38:02.417
I'm sorry.

38:02.417 --> 38:03.709
I'm sorry, Gary.

38:03.709 --> 38:04.918
Are we going to
the strip club?

38:04.918 --> 38:06.584
Yeah, I'll come in there.

38:06.584 --> 38:08.334
Eww.

38:08.334 --> 38:09.918
Daisy needs to laid, oh!

38:09.918 --> 38:14.501
Daisy needs to get laid!

38:14.501 --> 38:16.250
Right!
Pull over, cabbie!

38:16.250 --> 38:20.751
It's been three years since
a dick has been near me.

38:20.751 --> 38:24.000
Was it that bad three years ago
that you didn't wanna go again?

38:24.000 --> 38:27.834
-----ing asshole.
-[bleep]

38:27.834 --> 38:28.834
-Everyone out.
-Yeah.

38:28.834 --> 38:29.834
Thank God!

38:29.834 --> 38:33.501
Best cab ride ever!

38:33.501 --> 38:35.167
Let's get that hot tub on.

38:35.167 --> 38:37.250
You're chugging it.

38:37.250 --> 38:39.375
You're an animal.

38:39.375 --> 38:41.167
Okay, let's go.

38:41.167 --> 38:42.667
We gotta work some
sh-- out, big D.

38:42.667 --> 38:43.959
Yeah.

38:43.959 --> 38:47.250
Big D hasn't had
one in big three.

38:47.250 --> 38:48.584
[laughter]

38:48.584 --> 38:50.250
Oh, you're getting
into your bikinis?

38:50.250 --> 38:51.667
-Yes!
-Oh, good!

38:51.667 --> 38:53.250
If it was up to me,
I would be spending

38:53.250 --> 38:57.876
the rest of this night in
a guest cabin with Gary.

38:57.876 --> 39:00.626
And Gary's gonna spring from
that bunk like a little gazelle.

39:00.626 --> 39:02.542
Which one is sex on legs?
This one?

39:02.542 --> 39:04.501
No, we're just taking the
tequila upstairs, and that's it.

39:04.501 --> 39:07.876
I don't wanna cause any trouble,
but I know how good I look.

39:07.876 --> 39:09.667
Let's get in.

39:09.667 --> 39:11.626
Yeah!

39:11.626 --> 39:14.834
Kelsie, you don't need your
sweatsuit, get in the water.

39:14.834 --> 39:17.292
This is a party. Are you gonna
take your shirt off or not?

39:17.292 --> 39:19.417
The hot tub, I mean,
it looked cleaner before.

39:19.417 --> 39:21.292
Well, you did a
sh-- job cleaning it.

39:21.292 --> 39:22.459
Whatever.

39:22.459 --> 39:23.626
If we all looked
at our department,

39:23.626 --> 39:24.626
it wouldn't be very clean.

39:24.626 --> 39:26.584
I embrace the dirtiness.

39:26.584 --> 39:28.417
I'm like, give it to me.

39:28.417 --> 39:31.417
I love defiant, drunk Daisy.

39:31.417 --> 39:33.292
This is the dirtiest
I've been in three years.

39:33.292 --> 39:35.292
Yeah, baby.

39:35.292 --> 39:36.834
Daisy's a little intimidating.

39:36.834 --> 39:41.334
I ----ing love it.

39:41.334 --> 39:43.334
-Not her.
-No.

39:43.334 --> 39:45.667
I think the two girls are gonna
get on each other's nerves.

39:45.667 --> 39:47.501
-Us? Sharing a room?
-----er

39:47.501 --> 39:51.250
-I think you and you.
-Oh!

39:51.250 --> 40:02.459
Ugh!

40:02.459 --> 40:03.792
Do you want a drink, guys?

40:03.792 --> 40:05.542
I'll only drink if you
get back in.

40:05.542 --> 40:07.292
I'm gonna get in,
but I need to get a drink.

40:07.292 --> 40:09.459
Okay, then I'll have a vodka,
soda, lime, please.

40:09.459 --> 40:12.250
Vodka, soda, lime.

40:12.250 --> 40:13.459
I'll sit here by myself.

40:13.459 --> 40:15.292
I do want to get to know Gary,

40:15.292 --> 40:19.459
but I also kind of just
want to, like, make out.

40:19.459 --> 40:22.459
What did she say, a vodka,
soda, lime, in a new glass.

40:22.459 --> 40:25.709
Hey, lady in pink.

40:25.709 --> 40:30.667
What problem?

40:30.667 --> 40:32.542
It starts with an H
and ends with a Y.

40:32.542 --> 40:34.250
I like guessing games,
they're my favorite.

40:34.250 --> 40:37.125
Starts with an H.

40:37.125 --> 40:38.250
H-O.

40:38.250 --> 40:41.626
Ho-- oh, I got you.

40:41.626 --> 40:44.250
R-N-Y.

40:44.250 --> 40:45.459
Take it easy.

40:45.459 --> 40:59.918
[bleep] me.
So, I have no chance.

40:59.918 --> 41:01.709
Okay.

41:01.709 --> 41:07.501
Yeah.

41:07.501 --> 41:09.626
I'm gonna go
night night like this.

41:09.626 --> 41:12.334
Goodnight, girly.

41:12.334 --> 41:13.626
All right, guys,
see you tomorrow.

41:13.626 --> 41:14.626
I'm going to bed.

41:14.626 --> 41:16.417
[snores]

41:16.417 --> 41:20.918
[bleep], I don't
wanna go to bed.

41:20.918 --> 41:24.292
So, how do you feel about
Gary King?

41:24.292 --> 41:26.792
I mean, I don't
wanna talk about it.

41:26.792 --> 41:28.459
You're young.

41:28.459 --> 41:30.292
That means other chicks
are gonna go for you

41:30.292 --> 41:32.292
because you're ----ing
20 years younger than them.

41:32.292 --> 41:33.918
-That's not what I asked you.
-That's not true.

41:33.918 --> 41:40.000
None of the girls--

41:40.000 --> 41:45.459
It's not an insult, it's just--

41:45.459 --> 41:46.709
Can I just say one thing?

41:46.709 --> 41:49.459
How's that [bleep] for you?
'Cause you're single as [bleep].

41:49.459 --> 41:50.709
That's fine.

41:50.709 --> 41:51.876
How is that going for you?

41:51.876 --> 41:53.334
It doesn't matter how much--

41:53.334 --> 42:05.709
I-- I feel like
I'm-- ----ing...

42:05.709 --> 42:07.459
I threw-- exactly.

42:07.459 --> 42:09.292
So that's-- so you just
base your opinions around that.

42:09.292 --> 42:11.626
Tom's getting his
----ing ass handed to him.

42:11.626 --> 42:13.584
-I made a mistake.
-Sounds good.

42:13.584 --> 42:15.459
It just feels patronizing.

42:15.459 --> 42:17.292
That's just bullsh--.

42:17.292 --> 42:24.626
If anyone needs to grow up, I
reckon you should a little bit.

42:24.626 --> 42:33.334
No. Yeah, fair enough.

42:33.334 --> 42:34.709
Next on "Below Deck
Sailing Yacht"...

42:34.709 --> 42:36.292
We had these guys last year.

42:36.292 --> 42:37.876
Oh, ----ing Erika.

42:37.876 --> 42:40.501
These people are disrespectful,
they're exhausting.

42:40.501 --> 42:44.209
I just don't want it.

42:44.209 --> 42:45.584
This whole title of second stew,

42:45.584 --> 42:47.417
third stew is a little
obsolete right now.

42:47.417 --> 42:49.626
She wants to be second stew,

42:49.626 --> 42:51.626
and I think she's trying to
make me look bad at this point.

42:51.626 --> 42:53.959
I don't like any
pink in my steak.

42:53.959 --> 42:55.834
Ahh.

42:55.834 --> 42:57.167
I'm not gonna eat that either,
'cause that's gross.

42:57.167 --> 42:58.792
Chuck, go [bleep] yourself.

42:58.792 --> 43:02.792
I've gotten better food
at the ballpark.
