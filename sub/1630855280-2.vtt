WEBVTT

00:23.860 --> 00:26.070
-Hey.
-Hi.

00:32.494 --> 00:35.747
Okay, who knows why we've been summoned?

00:35.831 --> 00:37.624
Jocelyn says she's found her new sound.

00:37.706 --> 00:41.586
Oh, okay, okay.
What about the sound we created for her?

00:52.431 --> 00:54.057
You guys are enabling her.

00:54.141 --> 00:57.060
There's obviously something a bit off.

00:57.144 --> 01:00.981
-Not all oars are in the water--
-The girl's mother died.

01:01.064 --> 01:04.401
So, my mother's dead.
Is your mother alive?

01:04.483 --> 01:06.820
-You are somethin' else.
-People die.

01:23.003 --> 01:26.590
People die, all the time.

01:26.673 --> 01:28.049
-Are you fuckin' joking now?
-Everybody dies.

01:28.133 --> 01:29.468
-Are you serious?
-What?

01:29.550 --> 01:31.386
-Hi, guys!
-Here she comes.

01:31.470 --> 01:33.096
-Oh, hi.
-Hey.

01:33.180 --> 01:35.098
Hi! Thank you guys so much for coming.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.142
I know it was last minute and everything.

01:37.224 --> 01:38.643
You call, we come.

01:38.727 --> 01:43.648
So, last night,
I got a little bit inspired

01:43.732 --> 01:46.318
and I took "World Class Sinner"

01:46.777 --> 01:48.612
and I re-did it.

01:48.695 --> 01:49.988
What?

01:50.072 --> 01:51.948
Well, I just--
I made it my own a little bit.

01:52.032 --> 01:53.241
Okay.

01:53.909 --> 01:56.244
Okay, Nikki, before you make up your mind,
will you just listen to it?

01:56.328 --> 01:58.413
-I'm really excited to play it for you.
-I mean--

01:59.039 --> 02:01.917
-Sure. Sure, sure.
-Is the speaker on?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.628
-Yeah, it's set up.
-Just gonna connect to the--

02:14.721 --> 02:18.975
Baby, it's hard to see
when you're lookin' at me

02:19.059 --> 02:23.271
But I do what I want,
don't give a fuck at all

02:23.355 --> 02:25.524
Lookin' for something sweet

02:25.607 --> 02:27.651
When it gets time to eat

02:27.734 --> 02:30.987
You better start to run when I call

02:31.071 --> 02:36.410
'Cause I know that you don't
really know how to handle it

02:39.371 --> 02:41.706
My heart's cold as a stone

02:41.790 --> 02:45.419
When you ask me
who you're dealin' with

02:47.546 --> 02:50.340
I'm just a freak, yeah

02:50.424 --> 02:56.763
You know I want it baaad

03:03.186 --> 03:06.940
I mean, okay, I'll go first.
I mean, it's not happening, it's not.

03:07.023 --> 03:08.859
-I mean, what? What?
-Alright. Wait, hold on.

03:08.942 --> 03:10.277
-Hey, Nikki.
-It's not happening.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.695
-It's not. Chaim, don't.
-Okay.

03:11.778 --> 03:15.157
Okay, but, Nikki, this is something that,
like, no one's doing.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.909
Well, yeah! There's a reason
no one is doing this right now.

03:17.993 --> 03:19.327
It's not commercial.

03:19.411 --> 03:20.579
Okay, but I told you it's not finished.

03:20.662 --> 03:22.539
By the time I finish it,
it will be commercial.

03:22.622 --> 03:24.875
Well, we have a giant fucking hit.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.753
Why would we change it?
Ticket sales are down.

03:27.836 --> 03:29.629
But, Nikki, it's not me.

03:29.713 --> 03:31.882
-It's not me.
-The single drops next Friday.

03:31.965 --> 03:33.842
We've already done our spends on radio,

03:33.925 --> 03:35.552
on digital, on streaming,

03:35.635 --> 03:38.513
and we spent $1 million
on the goddamn fucking

03:38.597 --> 03:42.809
giant strip club for the video
that you and Sarah Lawrence here

03:42.893 --> 03:44.519
are shooting this week.

03:45.771 --> 03:46.772
Okay.

03:47.439 --> 03:49.274
That's fine.
I'll release it myself.

03:49.357 --> 03:52.152
-Wait, baby. No, no, no, no, no.
-What the fuck are you-- Okay.

03:52.235 --> 03:55.197
So you think you've got a bigger
fuckin' dick than me now, Princess?

03:55.280 --> 03:56.823
You wanna fuckin' back it up a little bit

03:56.907 --> 03:59.159
and go through a little oral history
of how we fucking got here?

03:59.242 --> 04:02.079
Because I am more than happy.
I'll spell it out for you.

04:02.162 --> 04:04.414
Remember when your mother got sick?
It was Finkelstein and I.

04:04.498 --> 04:06.833
We came to you and we said,
"We should cancel that tour."

04:06.917 --> 04:09.711
And you said, "No, Nikki, don't.

04:09.795 --> 04:12.130
Please. I can do it. Trust me."

04:12.214 --> 04:15.050
And then a week before you're gonna play
Madison Square Garden,

04:15.133 --> 04:18.595
I get a call that you are
out of your fucking mind,

04:18.678 --> 04:24.893
babbling up on the roof,
talking to things in outer fuckin' space.

04:24.976 --> 04:26.436
All right, all right.

04:26.520 --> 04:29.106
-We don't have to rehash--
-So, wait, so what do we do?

04:29.189 --> 04:32.317
We cut our losses, we refund the tickets.

04:32.401 --> 04:34.486
We spent eight months getting you healthy

04:34.569 --> 04:37.906
and then we spend millions
sending you around the world,

04:37.989 --> 04:39.241
putting you with producers

04:39.324 --> 04:44.704
to give you an EP
of giant fucking big-titted hits!

04:44.788 --> 04:47.332
And now, you're gonna sit here and tell me

04:47.416 --> 04:49.918
that, "It's not me. I don't like it."

04:50.001 --> 04:52.504
Well, that's too bad.
It's too fucking late.

04:52.587 --> 04:54.131
That train has left the station

04:54.214 --> 04:57.092
and whether you like it or not,

04:57.175 --> 04:59.428
you are going for that ride!

05:06.017 --> 05:08.019
My suggestion to you?

05:10.105 --> 05:11.731
Appear grateful.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.986
Put on that face, the grateful one.

05:16.069 --> 05:18.488
Yeah, there it is.

05:19.906 --> 05:22.200
Well, thank you, Nikki,
for being so predictable--

05:22.284 --> 05:23.160
You're welcome.

05:23.243 --> 05:24.286
And

05:26.663 --> 05:29.332
fuck everyone else
for being a fucking coward.

05:44.973 --> 05:48.769
I mean, who wouldn't be grateful
after being talked to like that?

05:53.106 --> 05:55.567
Your call has been forwarded
to an automatic--

05:56.902 --> 05:58.278
It doesn't make any sense.

05:58.361 --> 05:59.905
We have a giant fucking hit.

05:59.988 --> 06:02.199
Have some tact
in the way that you say it.

06:02.282 --> 06:03.867
But you know it was awful.

06:03.950 --> 06:05.786
-Why don't one of you--
-I actually like it.

06:05.869 --> 06:07.370
-I think it's cool.
-I think it's--

06:07.454 --> 06:10.082
-I like all the breathing in it.
-Oh, please. You don't like it.

06:10.165 --> 06:11.249
We're not gonna win this one.

06:12.501 --> 06:15.962
I just didn't realize how hard
this was gonna be without her.

06:16.338 --> 06:19.549
When I lost my mother,
I was a wreck for a year.

06:21.051 --> 06:23.011
Of course, my mother was nice to me.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.150
What did you think of the song?

06:38.276 --> 06:40.112
You don't believe in it?

06:40.695 --> 06:42.322
You know what I believe in?

06:43.615 --> 06:44.616
You.

06:45.492 --> 06:46.910
100%.

08:16.625 --> 08:18.585
-Hey.
-Why'd you play them the song?

08:18.668 --> 08:22.297
-You know it's not done, right?
-No, I know, I know. I just--

08:23.090 --> 08:25.425
That was just the first night
working together.

08:26.259 --> 08:29.471
It was stupid. I was just excited.

08:29.763 --> 08:31.181
No, you should be.

08:31.681 --> 08:33.934
You know,
there's a powerful voice inside you.

08:34.476 --> 08:36.686
I wanna reach down and pull it out.

08:41.149 --> 08:42.359
What are you doing right now?

08:42.859 --> 08:44.820
You know, I'm just at the club.

08:44.903 --> 08:46.279
Nice.

08:46.363 --> 08:48.824
Just catchin' up on some work, you know?

08:49.199 --> 08:51.535
-Nice.
-Handlin' some business.

08:51.993 --> 08:53.370
Are you with people?

08:53.453 --> 08:54.913
Nah, it's just me here.

08:54.996 --> 08:58.375
It's so late, I thought you'd be,
like, sleeping or something.

08:58.458 --> 09:02.003
I'm literally about to sleep
and then I just-- I realized my phone

09:02.087 --> 09:05.006
was on silent all day,
and my assistant had my phone--

09:05.090 --> 09:06.925
So, where are you from originally?

09:07.008 --> 09:08.593
I am from New York.

09:08.677 --> 09:10.804
Really? You don't seem like
you're from New York.

09:10.887 --> 09:12.722
Wow. I've...

09:13.765 --> 09:16.226
never been told that before.

09:16.309 --> 09:18.520
I feel like everyone says that I--

09:19.229 --> 09:23.483
I seem super East Coast,
like, uptight and everything.

09:23.567 --> 09:25.402
I've never been to New York.

09:25.485 --> 09:29.573
Really?
I mean, that's not bad, but it's--

09:30.323 --> 09:31.950
Well, maybe you should take me some time.

09:32.033 --> 09:33.118
Yeah, I mean,

09:33.201 --> 09:34.911
we should go on a trip.

09:34.995 --> 09:39.458
Show me around, I'd love that,
if you can handle it.

09:40.751 --> 09:43.587
Do you wanna come over
and work on some stuff?

09:44.045 --> 09:45.672
I can't tonight.

09:47.340 --> 09:48.717
Okay, what about tomorrow?

09:48.800 --> 09:50.802
Tomorrow,
I don't think I can tomorrow either,

09:50.886 --> 09:53.096
but maybe the day after?

09:54.055 --> 09:57.934
Yeah, I can do the day after.
I think that works for me.

09:58.935 --> 10:01.146
I'm shooting a music video that day.

10:01.897 --> 10:03.023
Maybe come over after?

10:03.106 --> 10:04.649
Alright, well then, I'll see you

10:05.776 --> 10:07.360
hopefully, I'll see you in a couple days.

10:07.444 --> 10:09.905
Yeah. Yeah. That would be nice.

10:09.988 --> 10:12.491
Take care of that voice.
Try not to smoke too much.

10:14.785 --> 10:15.786
Joss.

10:18.163 --> 10:20.916
Joss. Come on. Time to get up.

10:20.999 --> 10:24.294
I feel like you were up
talking to that gross guy all night.

10:25.504 --> 10:27.089
Coffee's on the side table.

10:30.008 --> 10:32.969
So you're going back
to the original version of the song?

10:35.138 --> 10:38.391
Yeah. My manager said
we're not gonna win this fight.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.187
Well, maybe you need a new team.

10:44.064 --> 10:46.316
You should be surrounded
by people who believe in you

10:48.819 --> 10:50.153
and trust your vision.

11:01.415 --> 11:03.125
-Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

11:03.667 --> 11:04.918
-You need anything else?
-No.

11:05.001 --> 11:05.919
You good?

11:10.757 --> 11:11.967
You're not hungry?

11:12.926 --> 11:14.344
You're not hungry?

11:14.428 --> 11:15.846
No, it's really good.

11:20.642 --> 11:22.185
Lasers, poles.

11:22.269 --> 11:24.396
This is the set design
for the music video.

11:24.479 --> 11:27.023
-I love that--
-She's gonna love that, right?

11:27.107 --> 11:28.442
-Yeah.
-That'll look great.

11:29.484 --> 11:33.029
I'm not always so sure
that I have a vision.

11:38.869 --> 11:41.872
I think you know exactly who you are
and where you wanna go.

11:51.715 --> 11:53.300
Hi. We're here for the music video.

11:53.383 --> 11:54.509
Do you ladies have ID?

11:56.470 --> 11:57.846
-My apologies.
-Thank you.

11:57.929 --> 11:59.097
Thanks a lot, guys.

12:11.109 --> 12:12.110
Sick.

12:12.486 --> 12:14.404
Yes, she's coming.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.865
-Xander, oh, my God.
-You like it?

12:16.948 --> 12:18.325
-I love it.
-Good.

12:18.408 --> 12:19.826
It's so sick.

12:23.121 --> 12:24.664
-What do you think?
-Do you love it?

12:28.919 --> 12:31.797
It's just like--
It's not really what I imagined.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.173
What do you mean?

12:33.256 --> 12:34.633
I just feel like it's really ironic.

12:34.716 --> 12:37.135
Like, in a way that, like,
the fans are not gonna understand.

12:37.219 --> 12:38.553
So, I just got a text message

12:38.637 --> 12:41.181
that the reason Jocelyn
was three and a half hours late

12:41.264 --> 12:42.641
is she was in a makeup trailer,

12:42.724 --> 12:46.311
they were having to airbrush cuts
on her inner thighs.

12:46.394 --> 12:49.439
Joss, remember I showed you the photos
last week at the house. We went through--

12:49.523 --> 12:50.816
-Alright, here she is.
-You approved them.

12:50.899 --> 12:52.275
-Yeah, I know--
-Hey, Joss.

12:52.359 --> 12:53.902
-Hey. How are you?
-You look great. Jesus.

12:53.985 --> 12:56.154
-Look at this outfit. Gorgeous!
-Thank you.

12:56.238 --> 12:57.239
I don't wanna argue about it.

12:57.322 --> 13:00.033
I can't have another incident like this.
I can't afford it.

13:00.117 --> 13:02.160
Okay, we're running way behind
on schedule, so we'll get you

13:02.244 --> 13:03.745
-on stage right away.
-I know, I'm sorry.

13:03.829 --> 13:05.205
I had to get, like, sewn into this thing
and everything.

13:05.288 --> 13:06.415
-Makeup took forever, but

13:06.498 --> 13:08.375
they're waiting for you up there.
We'll get you at your one.

13:08.458 --> 13:09.793
All right, people!

13:09.876 --> 13:12.129
Let's make the dream happen!

13:12.212 --> 13:14.798
-All right and action!
-Seven. Eight!

13:17.300 --> 13:18.301
Pop!

13:18.802 --> 13:19.803
Sharp!

13:23.265 --> 13:25.684
-One!
-Baby, it's hard to see

13:25.767 --> 13:27.936
When you're lookin' at me

13:28.019 --> 13:29.938
-But I do what I want
-Push, push!

13:30.021 --> 13:31.982
Don't give a fuck at all

13:32.065 --> 13:34.401
-Is it sexy?
-Yeah, it's fucking sexy.

13:34.484 --> 13:36.611
-Look at her.
-Well, she's sexy,

13:36.695 --> 13:38.613
but the whole scene, I don't know.

13:38.697 --> 13:40.365
I think she looks like a really hot woman

13:40.449 --> 13:43.660
dancing at a strip club
with hot strippers.

13:43.744 --> 13:47.038
But, off the record,
do they seem gay to you?

13:47.372 --> 13:49.541
-The strippers? The hot strippers?
-Do they seem gay to me?

13:49.624 --> 13:51.251
-The strippers?
-Cut it!

13:51.334 --> 13:53.837
Okay, that's a cut.
We cut. Great, new setup.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.339
-Excellent.
-Yeah, Joss!

13:56.423 --> 13:58.216
That was amazing, Joss!

13:58.300 --> 14:00.093
Do you mind if we just playback?

14:00.177 --> 14:01.470
Yeah! Let's get her playback.

14:01.553 --> 14:03.722
I mean, they're kind of out-femming her

14:03.805 --> 14:07.058
at certain points with the flips
and the dips

14:07.142 --> 14:10.020
and the gack-gadda-gack-gack-gow, ya know?
-Yeah.

14:10.103 --> 14:13.315
-That looked great.
-Yeah, I can do this move a lot better.

14:13.398 --> 14:15.567
And this whole beginning part
needs to be tighter.

14:15.650 --> 14:17.986
I feel like these lights are,
like, really intense,

14:18.070 --> 14:19.654
and they're, like,
muddying up the skin tones.

14:19.738 --> 14:21.156
I'm sorry. It's just like a first take.

14:21.239 --> 14:22.699
-I know it'll be better next time.
-Oh, no. It's brilliant.

14:22.783 --> 14:25.118
-I mean, it looks great.
-No, trust me, it'll be better.

14:25.202 --> 14:27.204
Hold that pose, dancers.

14:29.873 --> 14:30.749
Action.

14:31.124 --> 14:32.209
Seven. Eight!

14:34.961 --> 14:36.171
Sharp!

14:36.671 --> 14:37.881
Sharp!

14:39.549 --> 14:41.218
Take your time. Don't rush.

14:41.301 --> 14:45.013
Baby, it's hard to see
when you're lookin' at me

14:45.097 --> 14:47.474
-Grab! Go!
-But I do what I want

14:47.557 --> 14:51.144
-I'm just a freak, yeah
-Cut, cut!

14:51.228 --> 14:53.522
-Guys, cut it!
-Why did we cut, Kim?

14:53.605 --> 14:54.648
Go, Joss!

14:54.731 --> 14:57.651
All right, so we'll do a new deal.
We got it. We're movin' on. New deal.

14:57.734 --> 14:59.319
No, we didn't. Can I see it again?

14:59.403 --> 15:00.779
I mean, it's fantastic.

15:00.862 --> 15:03.740
-No, no, it's not.
-We can't keep doing this.

15:03.824 --> 15:06.034
I'm gonna keep doing it until it's right.

15:06.118 --> 15:07.494
So, let's go one more time

15:07.577 --> 15:08.995
and I'm gonna make sure
to really throw the...

15:09.079 --> 15:11.164
-Oh. Okay.
-...the heads the way I'm supposed to.

15:11.248 --> 15:12.541
-All right.
-I'm so sorry. None of this.

15:12.624 --> 15:15.252
Guys! Sorry. One more.

15:16.128 --> 15:17.796
All right, back to ones!

15:17.879 --> 15:20.715
I also think Jocelyn's context
is important here

15:20.799 --> 15:22.717
because her mother died of cancer.

15:22.801 --> 15:25.053
She had a very public breakdown.

15:25.137 --> 15:27.681
She was cheated on
by somebody who loved her.

15:27.764 --> 15:29.307
Yeah, heartthrob Rob.

15:29.391 --> 15:30.642
She's down.

15:30.725 --> 15:33.562
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

15:34.187 --> 15:35.856
Joss, we need to see you sing.

15:35.939 --> 15:38.734
-Your mouth is not moving to the lyrics.
-Okay.

15:39.568 --> 15:40.694
Sorry, I think I was just--

15:41.445 --> 15:44.531
I think I was just too focused on, like,
getting all the beats right, but I'll...

15:44.614 --> 15:46.324
You're really pushing it, okay?

15:47.451 --> 15:48.744
-It's great. Trust me.
-I don't think it's a bad thing

15:48.827 --> 15:49.995
-to push for something that matters.
-Trust me.

15:50.078 --> 15:51.288
Can we just do one more?
I really feel strongly about it--

15:51.371 --> 15:52.706
All right, all right. One more, guys.

15:52.789 --> 15:54.040
One. Two. Three.

15:55.208 --> 15:56.376
Don't drop.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.797
If you're not there to catch me,
like, when I'm falling, it's just--

16:00.881 --> 16:03.383
I'm gonna, like, crack
my fucking head open, all right?

16:03.467 --> 16:05.802
Cut it. Cut it, cut it, cut it!

16:05.886 --> 16:07.429
All right. And cut it, please!

16:07.512 --> 16:09.556
Great. All right, everybody take a break.
Thank you.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.226
-You okay?
-Yeah.

16:13.310 --> 16:15.312
Who is that dancer talkin' to Joss?

16:15.812 --> 16:17.147
-Right there?
-With the long--

16:17.230 --> 16:18.607
That's Dyanne.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.234
-Dyanne.
-Why?

16:21.318 --> 16:23.320
She's out-dancing everybody.

16:23.403 --> 16:24.821
Does she sing?

16:25.405 --> 16:26.990
I don't know.

16:27.074 --> 16:28.950
She's good, though. She's a good dancer.

16:29.534 --> 16:31.453
I know that it's, like, my fault
because I probably should've, like,

16:31.536 --> 16:32.954
looked closer at the photos.

16:33.038 --> 16:36.124
But, if there's any way we could just,
like, take today

16:36.208 --> 16:38.335
and just, like,
tweak some things about the set

16:38.418 --> 16:40.420
and shoot tomorrow, like,
I really think it'll be better.

16:41.338 --> 16:44.674
I don't know. I don't know.
You wanna just cancel today?

16:44.758 --> 16:46.259
I'll write a fuckin' check right now.

16:46.343 --> 16:47.260
That's how much it means to me--

16:47.344 --> 16:49.763
Well, it's like $450,000 for a day.

16:49.846 --> 16:51.014
I don't care.

16:51.098 --> 16:52.474
-That's how much it means to me.
-Well, I care.

16:52.557 --> 16:54.643
I really feel like
we don't have room for error here

16:54.726 --> 16:57.020
and I just feel like this is gonna be
like a fucking disaster

16:57.104 --> 16:59.856
and it's gonna be, like, really,
really humiliating for me.

16:59.940 --> 17:02.150
As much as you're freaking out,
they're worse.

17:02.234 --> 17:05.320
All right? And if we do that,
if we, like, pull out of today,

17:05.404 --> 17:08.907
to them, it's gonna be like,
"Okay, so in two weeks,

17:08.990 --> 17:10.951
she gonna, like,
pull out of a 50,000-seat arena,"

17:11.034 --> 17:12.577
and they gonna pull the plug on the tour.

17:12.661 --> 17:13.912
I don't wanna freak you out.

17:13.995 --> 17:15.330
Yeah, but it's not the same thing.

17:15.414 --> 17:17.541
I know, but to them,
they don't know that.

17:17.624 --> 17:20.585
So, look, whatever you wanna tweak,
we're gonna tweak.

17:20.669 --> 17:23.422
But first, you gonna show them
that you got this, all right?

17:23.505 --> 17:27.300
And show you fully committed,
crushing it, and sell it.

17:27.384 --> 17:29.845
Look at me. Hey, baby. You got this.

17:29.928 --> 17:32.681
-You can do that. You can do it.
-I can do this.

17:32.764 --> 17:35.475
I mean this because it's--
we don't have a choice.

17:36.476 --> 17:38.687
Yeah, Joss. Freakin' kill it.

17:38.770 --> 17:40.522
Come on, I'll tell you some information.

17:40.605 --> 17:41.648
Places.

17:42.274 --> 17:43.108
Let's do it!

17:43.942 --> 17:45.861
-I talked to my guy.
-Yeah?

17:45.944 --> 17:49.197
He said that this dude's name
is Tedros Tedros.

17:49.281 --> 17:51.366
-He what?
-All right. Camera set?

17:51.450 --> 17:53.326
Owns a nightclub in Hollywood.

17:53.410 --> 17:55.954
-Playback, action!
-Owes a lotta people a lotta money.

17:56.037 --> 17:59.040
This has been the last five years
of my life. I'm in hell.

17:59.124 --> 18:01.960
I mean, you could always go back
to singing and dancing.

18:02.043 --> 18:03.587
My big moment? Three episodes?

18:03.670 --> 18:05.338
-You were great.
-Thanks.

18:06.089 --> 18:08.341
His last place of residency was Hawaii.

18:08.425 --> 18:10.010
And then after that

18:10.761 --> 18:12.345
he doesn't seem to exist.

18:12.429 --> 18:13.972
His name is fuckin' Tedros Tedros.

18:14.055 --> 18:15.599
He's from Hawaii. Did you know this?

18:15.682 --> 18:18.018
-I don't think that he is.
-Oh, he is.

18:18.101 --> 18:20.479
No, we've looked into it.
He's from Hawaii.

18:20.562 --> 18:22.481
-Does this fulfill you?
-Off the record?

18:22.564 --> 18:26.401
-Off the record.
-I never fucking get a say, an actual say.

18:26.485 --> 18:27.527
I just am like--

18:28.570 --> 18:31.198
I'm here 'cause I love her and

18:32.157 --> 18:33.617
yeah, I don't know.

18:35.035 --> 18:36.119
Partners!

18:36.203 --> 18:38.121
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-All right, all right.

18:38.205 --> 18:39.748
-Cut it! What?
-I'm sorry.

18:39.831 --> 18:41.208
I was really early on that part,

18:41.291 --> 18:43.085
so that take--
you can't even use that take at all.

18:43.168 --> 18:45.295
Joss, no, we have to move on.

18:45.378 --> 18:46.922
It's fine.

18:47.297 --> 18:49.883
I'm gonna go check on her.

18:49.966 --> 18:50.967
Okay.

18:52.344 --> 18:55.222
All right, let's get ready, guys.
We're gonna go after this.

18:55.597 --> 18:57.849
-Let's get the dancers in there, please.
-Love you, Joss.

18:57.933 --> 18:59.351
He's a person of color.

18:59.935 --> 19:02.145
-And he's--
-Okay. What kind of color--

19:02.229 --> 19:04.481
Does he look Hawaiian?

19:04.564 --> 19:06.566
I don't think he--
No, I don't think he's Hawaiian.

19:06.650 --> 19:11.321
I think-- His hair is straight
and it's kind of long and--

19:11.405 --> 19:13.198
That could be Hawaiian.

19:13.281 --> 19:14.449
He's not.

19:14.533 --> 19:17.953
-Who the fuck is this guy?
-Sketchy as fuck.

19:18.036 --> 19:19.121
Well, what does he look like?

19:19.204 --> 19:21.415
He's a person of color.

19:21.498 --> 19:23.500
Are you saying he's Black?
You can say Black.

19:23.583 --> 19:24.960
You're allowed to say Black.

19:25.460 --> 19:26.670
Is he Black?

19:27.796 --> 19:29.464
-Yes.
-Okay, he's a Black guy.

19:29.548 --> 19:30.382
-Yeah.
-Okay.

19:30.465 --> 19:32.592
-Do you know about her cutting her legs?
-What?

19:32.676 --> 19:33.969
You didn't know about this?

19:34.052 --> 19:36.221
Sorry, but that take is, like,
completely unusable.

19:36.304 --> 19:38.265
-I really messed up this part.
-Nikki, Nikki.

19:38.348 --> 19:40.559
-What do you want me to do about it?
-Go the fuck up there and talk to her.

19:40.642 --> 19:42.018
Nikki, we've gotta go again!

19:42.102 --> 19:43.562
Yeah, Nikki, it's fuckin' your job now.

19:43.645 --> 19:45.397
-All right, well, then go take a break.
-I mean--

19:45.480 --> 19:47.566
The reason they were in makeup
for three hours

19:47.649 --> 19:50.360
is because she had
these cuts on her thighs

19:50.444 --> 19:51.737
and they had to airbrush it

19:51.820 --> 19:53.739
-and cover them up.
-Oh, shit.

19:53.822 --> 19:55.073
You don't know about this?

19:55.157 --> 19:56.867
No, I don't know nothin' 'bout it.
If I knew somethin' 'bout it,

19:56.950 --> 19:58.201
I would tell you before you tell me.

19:58.285 --> 19:59.870
Who the fuck is the director?
Me or her?

19:59.953 --> 20:01.788
-Go have a lie down.
-Fuckin' A.

20:01.872 --> 20:03.874
-Jesus fucking Christ.
-Go have a lie down in that cozy trailer.

20:03.957 --> 20:05.333
Take 15, please.

20:05.417 --> 20:07.544
Nice work, dancers. Get some water.

20:07.627 --> 20:11.173
She said the glass broke on her thighs.

20:11.256 --> 20:13.633
A glass broke on her thighs?

20:13.717 --> 20:16.928
How did the--
How did the glass break on her thighs?

20:19.014 --> 20:21.183
It fucking breaks my heart
to see her like this.

20:21.266 --> 20:22.350
I don't know what this fuckin' is.

20:22.434 --> 20:23.643
I'm really sorry, you guys.

20:24.186 --> 20:25.645
I know you guys are tired.

20:25.979 --> 20:28.982
Take a minute right now
and we'll go again in a second, okay?

20:31.401 --> 20:33.236
-But that's why we gotta step in.
-Right.

20:33.320 --> 20:34.780
Her mother's gone now.

20:34.863 --> 20:37.032
-So now, we her new parents.
-Okay, okay, okay. I know.

20:37.115 --> 20:38.366
-That's what we promised her.
-All right.

20:38.450 --> 20:40.243
I'm telling you right now,
these people in here

20:40.327 --> 20:42.204
are gauging whether or not
you still got it.

20:42.287 --> 20:43.205
So this is what you need to do:

20:43.288 --> 20:46.083
You got to go in there,
and you got to give it your all.

20:46.166 --> 20:47.209
'Cause I'm telling you right now,

20:47.292 --> 20:49.294
if you don't,
these people gonna fuck up your career.

20:49.377 --> 20:51.588
But, if you do,
your fans are gonna say,

20:51.671 --> 20:53.882
"Jocelyn is my motherfucking idol."

20:54.800 --> 20:56.176
-Okay.
-All right.

20:57.761 --> 20:59.596
You can pull my hair

20:59.679 --> 21:01.765
Touch me anywhere

21:01.848 --> 21:03.475
Ball and chain

21:03.558 --> 21:06.394
Okay. Yeah, no, you're incredible.

21:06.478 --> 21:08.355
Aubin? You can sing, you can dance.

21:08.438 --> 21:10.107
Aubin's gonna take you to stage five.

21:10.190 --> 21:12.401
I want her to lay down a track right now.

21:12.484 --> 21:13.610
-Right now?
-Yeah, right now.

21:13.693 --> 21:14.945
I'm really sorry. I've just--

21:15.487 --> 21:17.489
I've had a really hard year
with just, like,

21:17.572 --> 21:19.574
losing my mom and everything,
and I think just being back here

21:19.658 --> 21:22.119
shooting the video, it's bringing up
a lotta grief, and I'm probably,

21:22.202 --> 21:24.121
like, more emotional than I would be.

21:24.204 --> 21:26.957
So, I just-- I really hope you
take that into consideration when you're

21:27.040 --> 21:30.043
-writing the article.
-I will. Absolutely.

21:30.669 --> 21:32.337
You're human.

21:32.421 --> 21:34.423
We gotta go again, all right?
Let's shoot it!

21:36.550 --> 21:38.135
Come on, Joss. You've got this.

21:38.218 --> 21:39.386
You look great, Joss.

21:39.469 --> 21:41.346
All right, guys, reset.

21:41.847 --> 21:43.390
Get it right.

21:43.849 --> 21:46.810
I'm sorry, you guys.
I just-- I really gotta get this right.

21:46.893 --> 21:47.936
Got to get it.

21:48.019 --> 21:49.896
I wanna just go again right away.

21:49.980 --> 21:51.731
-Let's just do one more take.
-All right.

21:51.815 --> 21:53.400
-I'm gonna get it. I promise.
-We're gonna go again, right, guys?

21:53.483 --> 21:54.860
Let's go again! We're gonna go again.

21:54.943 --> 21:55.902
Let's go again! Can we roll?

21:55.986 --> 21:58.655
Yeah.
We're gonna go again.

21:59.990 --> 22:03.160
Let's go again. Right?
Come on, everybody, just get back.

22:03.243 --> 22:05.370
We're just gonna go right back into it.

22:09.499 --> 22:10.959
Alright, lights to one!

22:11.042 --> 22:13.378
Camera ready, and action!

22:14.296 --> 22:16.089
Take your time!

22:18.800 --> 22:20.802
Nice! Yes!

22:22.137 --> 22:24.306
-Baby, it's hard to see
-Gorgeous!

22:24.389 --> 22:26.391
When you're lookin' at me

22:26.475 --> 22:28.477
But I do what I want

22:28.560 --> 22:30.562
-Don't give a fuck at all
-Yeah, Joss!

22:30.645 --> 22:32.856
-Lookin' for somethin' sweet
-Beautiful, yes!

22:32.939 --> 22:34.983
When it comes time to eat

22:35.067 --> 22:36.276
You better start to run

22:36.359 --> 22:38.445
-Nice!
-When I call

22:38.528 --> 22:41.448
-'Cause I know that you don't really know
-Yes, get it!

22:41.531 --> 22:44.159
How to handle it

22:44.618 --> 22:45.535
Nice!

22:45.619 --> 22:46.787
-So hot!
-Yeah!

22:46.870 --> 22:49.164
I'm just a freak, yeah

22:49.247 --> 22:52.876
You know I want it bad

22:55.253 --> 22:57.464
And we can meet, yeah

22:57.547 --> 23:01.968
But I don't need to know your name

23:02.636 --> 23:04.805
-What the fuck, Harry? What the fuck?
-Adjust it. Adjust it.

23:04.888 --> 23:06.640
What the fuck?
I think the fuckin' motor slipped.

23:06.723 --> 23:08.308
-I can't see her. I can't see anything.
-I know. Alright.

23:08.391 --> 23:09.726
Just give me a minute to,
we have to bring

23:09.810 --> 23:11.853
-the camera down...
-This is the camera.

23:11.937 --> 23:14.314
-... the frequency. I'm not sure.
-But that was gorgeous.

23:14.397 --> 23:17.150
-It was gorgeous before.
-Nikki, calm down, please.

23:21.822 --> 23:23.365
And I'm wild as a stallion

23:23.448 --> 23:26.868
So come enjoy the rodeo

23:29.329 --> 23:30.247
I'm just a freak...

23:30.330 --> 23:31.331
That's what it's gonna be like
on the thing?

23:31.415 --> 23:32.582
Harry, can you--

23:32.666 --> 23:34.126
Please, God, tell me that it recorded.

23:34.209 --> 23:35.836
Harry, we need focus, please.

23:38.213 --> 23:39.381
-Nice!
-Yes!

23:39.464 --> 23:41.091
Hell yeah, Joss!

23:41.466 --> 23:42.509
That was the one!

23:42.592 --> 23:44.010
Beautiful.

23:44.511 --> 23:46.471
Okay, we need to take a break!

23:46.555 --> 23:48.682
-Take a break!
-What do you think?

23:48.765 --> 23:51.143
-It was a good take, right?
-I'm sorry, Joss.

23:51.226 --> 23:52.811
It was out of focus.

23:52.894 --> 23:54.479
The whole take was out of focus.

23:54.563 --> 23:56.481
Joss, you're gonna have to do it again.

23:56.982 --> 23:58.859
Just-- Yeah, okay. It's gonna be fine.

23:58.942 --> 24:01.236
We gotta go again.
Guys, we gotta go again.

24:01.319 --> 24:02.529
Right away, let's go.

24:04.448 --> 24:06.116
-I miss my mom.
-It's all right. Alright.

24:06.199 --> 24:08.410
Come on! Everyone, to your ones. Please.

24:19.588 --> 24:21.757
-It's the feet again? It's the feet again.
-Yeah.

24:36.521 --> 24:39.399
Joss, do you need something?
Do you need some water?

24:39.483 --> 24:41.193
Can you get Kirsten in makeup?

24:41.276 --> 24:43.487
Can we get makeup, please?

24:44.613 --> 24:46.198
What's going on?

24:47.824 --> 24:49.409
I'm sorry.

24:49.576 --> 24:52.120
Come on. Push through the pain.

24:52.412 --> 24:54.831
All right, let's get ready, guys.
We're gonna go after this.

24:54.915 --> 24:56.416
She needs a break.

24:57.542 --> 24:58.668
If you wanna be a star,

24:58.752 --> 25:00.128
you're gonna have to
push through the pain.

25:01.296 --> 25:03.715
Off grip. Off grip.

25:06.301 --> 25:07.469
Don't fight it.

25:08.095 --> 25:10.055
Don't fight it. You've done it before.
Don't fight it.

25:10.764 --> 25:13.391
You've done it before. There you go.

25:14.226 --> 25:16.269
No, we just gettin' started. Let's go.

25:18.105 --> 25:20.524
Yeah, lower. To Charly.

25:21.733 --> 25:22.651
Yeah.

25:24.069 --> 25:25.695
Lower, thrust.

25:26.613 --> 25:27.614
Yeah.

25:28.949 --> 25:30.575
Now look at Sophie.

25:31.618 --> 25:35.622
They're the audience.
Make them believe you wanna fuck them.

25:35.705 --> 25:38.500
Lower, lower. Lower, Izaak.

25:40.127 --> 25:42.129
Fuckin' lower. Yeah.

25:42.212 --> 25:44.131
You're not a human, Izaak.
Don't forget.

25:44.881 --> 25:46.550
You're a fucking star.

25:47.926 --> 25:49.511
Joss, can we go again?

25:49.594 --> 25:50.887
All right, let's go again.

25:50.971 --> 25:54.057
I mean, I asked her, but she said
"No, it's gonna change the stepping."

25:54.641 --> 25:55.517
Oh, Jesus Christ.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.811
-Joss?
-Chaim?

25:58.562 --> 26:00.397
-You good?
-Are you good, Joss?

26:01.189 --> 26:02.566
Yeah, should we go again?

26:02.649 --> 26:05.026
-You ready to do it again?
-Yeah.

26:08.238 --> 26:10.407
It's fine, it's fine.
I don't think you'll be able to see it.

26:18.623 --> 26:19.833
Mom?

26:20.792 --> 26:22.419
What's up, Joss, what?

26:23.211 --> 26:24.421
Mom?

26:26.381 --> 26:28.842
Oh, Jesus. It's all over her face.

26:28.925 --> 26:30.510
Oh, man.

26:30.594 --> 26:32.053
-Joss, we're, we're--
-Mom?

26:36.433 --> 26:38.268
Joss, are you okay?

26:39.394 --> 26:40.729
Are you calling for your mom?

26:40.812 --> 26:41.980
No, I...

26:42.063 --> 26:44.232
You didn't just call for your mom?

26:44.316 --> 26:45.525
No.

26:45.609 --> 26:47.778
My mom died last year.

26:48.528 --> 26:50.655
-Okay.
-Okay.

26:50.739 --> 26:53.575
-Okay.
-Just a second. I'll go again.

26:53.658 --> 26:54.785
Yeah.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.831
Nikki. Nikki.

27:03.001 --> 27:04.461
Mommy

27:05.837 --> 27:07.047
I need you.

27:07.714 --> 27:09.508
-What is going on?
-She's in pain.

27:09.591 --> 27:12.636
She's bleeding. Her feet,
her fuckin' cuts on her legs, everything.

27:12.719 --> 27:14.179
You better, somehow,

27:14.262 --> 27:16.431
-pep talk her into this. Something.
-Okay, okay, okay, okay.

27:16.515 --> 27:17.599
What's wrong?

27:17.682 --> 27:20.644
-Is everybody watching?
-Fuck them.

27:20.727 --> 27:22.938
-Talk to me.
-I just--

27:24.564 --> 27:26.817
I've never done this without her before.

27:27.692 --> 27:29.069
I don't know what to do.

27:30.195 --> 27:32.239
You have to have this moment.

27:32.322 --> 27:34.533
It's fresh and it's early. I get it.

27:34.616 --> 27:36.410
But I've already wasted everybody's time.

27:36.493 --> 27:38.912
I do not give a fuck
about none of these people.

27:38.995 --> 27:42.082
Because none of these people would be here
or employed without you.

27:43.333 --> 27:46.586
You take your time
and you do what you need to do.

27:46.962 --> 27:49.756
If you want,
I would tell all these people to take 10.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.967
-I love you, D.
-Of course.

27:52.050 --> 27:55.303
-I really love you.
-I love you, too. Come on.

27:55.387 --> 27:58.390
Fuck that. You're havin' a human moment.

27:58.473 --> 28:00.350
We can take a break.

28:00.767 --> 28:01.935
No.

28:02.018 --> 28:04.521
Or you wanna power through it
and then just call it a day?

28:04.604 --> 28:07.357
-Yeah, I wanna power through.
-Okay.

28:12.738 --> 28:15.157
Alright. I'ma be right back, okay?

28:15.240 --> 28:16.450
Okay.

28:24.249 --> 28:25.250
I'm fine.

28:26.460 --> 28:27.627
Sorry.

28:27.711 --> 28:32.549
I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna
break up the party here. I know--

28:33.049 --> 28:34.926
I see that you're really struggling.

28:35.010 --> 28:36.052
I understand.

28:36.136 --> 28:37.220
-I'm okay.
-Are you all right?

28:37.304 --> 28:38.722
I'm totally fine.

28:39.473 --> 28:40.932
Joss, here's the thing.

28:41.016 --> 28:43.018
I don't think you're totally fine.

28:43.101 --> 28:46.021
-Nikki, I'm totally fine.
-I'm not giving you a hard time.

28:46.104 --> 28:48.774
I'm just gonna be real with you.

28:48.857 --> 28:50.650
I think it might be time to go home

28:50.734 --> 28:52.277
-and get some sleep.
-I don't need to go home, Nikki.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.362
I'm gonna go again right now. I promise.

28:54.446 --> 28:57.449
I don't think--
I need you to go home and get some sleep.

28:57.532 --> 28:59.910
-I really, really wanna go tomorrow. Okay?
-Okay.

28:59.993 --> 29:01.536
-You promise?
-All right. Yeah.

29:01.620 --> 29:02.746
You promise?

29:04.081 --> 29:06.208
-Joss--
-You promise we can go tomorrow?

29:07.125 --> 29:08.293
We'll go tomorrow, Joss.

29:08.376 --> 29:10.504
I'm gonna pay for all of it.
I'm really, really sorry.

29:10.587 --> 29:11.671
-Okay.
-I'm so sorry.

29:12.506 --> 29:14.674
Okay, guys, let's get her home.

29:18.261 --> 29:20.055
-Wanna go through the stairs?
-Sorry, my foot.

29:20.138 --> 29:22.390
Let's go to the stairs.
Let's just take the stairs.

29:26.394 --> 29:27.771
-Everybody, get--
-Everybody, out.

29:27.854 --> 29:29.606
-Let's clear everybody out of here.
-Everybody, out.

29:29.689 --> 29:32.901
Now, please! Everybody, out!

29:32.984 --> 29:34.569
Let's get her home, okay, guys?

29:34.653 --> 29:38.323
Xander, give me a call when you get home,
and she's in bed, and--

29:38.407 --> 29:39.366
-Yeah.
-Okay.

29:39.449 --> 29:42.035
Get the spot off of her, please!

29:42.119 --> 29:43.370
-I'm sorry.
-No.

29:45.622 --> 29:49.709
Do we have something for her feet?
Do you wanna take my shoes?

30:05.684 --> 30:07.686
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Joss?

30:08.186 --> 30:09.312
Joss. Joss.

30:09.396 --> 30:11.606
All right, Nikki. What now?

30:13.024 --> 30:16.027
I have an idea. Aubin?

30:16.570 --> 30:18.655
Aubin. Aubin! Oh, great, thanks.

30:18.739 --> 30:20.699
Will you go get Dyanne, bring her here?

30:20.782 --> 30:22.242
-Yeah, of course.
-Thanks so much.

30:22.325 --> 30:23.285
You sit down.

30:23.827 --> 30:25.036
Sit down.

30:25.912 --> 30:28.540
Your story's about to get a lot bigger.

30:36.506 --> 30:39.718
So, Nikki is scrapping the music video.

30:40.761 --> 30:43.263
Chaim? Am I gonna lose everything?

30:44.890 --> 30:46.600
Look,
you can't let them see that side of you.

30:46.683 --> 30:49.019
-All right? It's really fuckin' dangerous.
-I know.

30:49.102 --> 30:50.520
A lot of people depend on me.

30:50.604 --> 30:52.063
It's just irresponsible of me

30:52.147 --> 30:54.357
to keep floatin' you for almost a year now

30:54.441 --> 30:57.235
if you are not going to put out
any commercial music.

30:57.319 --> 31:00.405
I just can't keep covering
half the mortgage, I'm really sorry.

31:00.489 --> 31:02.532
I know, but you're not listening to me.

31:02.616 --> 31:05.869
I'm telling you,
I want to be bigger than this song.

31:05.952 --> 31:08.538
I wanna be a once-in-a-generation artist,

31:08.622 --> 31:12.209
and I wanna make music
that lasts longer than my life.

31:12.292 --> 31:14.086
But you're hanging by a thread right now.

31:14.169 --> 31:16.588
You're practically broke.
You're not putting out any new music.

31:16.671 --> 31:17.839
You're not focused at all.

31:17.923 --> 31:19.674
I mean, you don't like the song,
I understand,

31:19.758 --> 31:22.969
but you're not giving me any alternatives.

31:24.137 --> 31:26.306
At the end of the day,
it's not what you say, yeah?

31:26.389 --> 31:27.766
It's what you do.

31:28.475 --> 31:31.103
-Right.
-It's what you make. It's what you sing.

31:35.315 --> 31:37.109
Told myself I wasn't gonna lecture you.

31:39.319 --> 31:40.320
You know,

31:40.904 --> 31:43.407
I remember the first time
I saw you perform.

31:43.490 --> 31:46.368
You're 11 years old at Fox Hills Mall.
You remember?

31:46.451 --> 31:48.787
You played "Fever."

31:48.870 --> 31:50.414
The audience went so crazy

31:50.914 --> 31:52.749
they made you sing it a second time.

31:52.833 --> 31:54.209
I never saw anything like it.

31:54.292 --> 31:56.962
Right? I mean, before or since.

31:57.838 --> 32:00.173
God gave you such a beautiful gift.
I just...

32:01.007 --> 32:03.009
I just want you to use it.

32:04.553 --> 32:07.180
Chaim, this is the only thing
I know how to do.

32:08.223 --> 32:10.058
This is all I have.

32:12.936 --> 32:14.771
Please don't give up on me.

32:26.908 --> 32:28.368
Hello, Angel.

32:29.035 --> 32:30.036
Hi.

32:30.871 --> 32:32.164
What are you doing?

32:32.247 --> 32:34.249
I'm just with a couple friends.

32:36.501 --> 32:38.128
Do you wanna come over?

32:39.713 --> 32:42.758
-I don't wanna intrude.
-Yeah, it's fine.

32:43.842 --> 32:44.885
You sure?

32:44.968 --> 32:46.303
I'll see you soon.

32:46.386 --> 32:47.345
Okay, great.

32:51.183 --> 32:54.227
So, is she a better fuck than me?

32:54.311 --> 32:56.563
Baby, nobody's a better fuck than you.

32:57.063 --> 32:59.232
You didn't tell me it was a setup.

32:59.316 --> 33:02.027
-A setup?
-You said it would be good for the club.

33:02.986 --> 33:04.321
It's great for the club.

33:04.863 --> 33:06.782
Yeah, but you made music with her.

33:07.532 --> 33:08.784
She asked me to.

33:08.867 --> 33:10.035
And guess what?

33:10.118 --> 33:11.745
Nikki wants to sign me.

33:11.828 --> 33:13.747
Nikki? Jocelyn's label?

33:15.207 --> 33:18.335
Great.
I can finally get that return on you.

33:20.712 --> 33:23.340
Have Nikki call me to negotiate.

34:01.128 --> 34:03.004
She lives in a hotel?

34:03.088 --> 34:05.715
No. this is her house.

34:13.974 --> 34:16.268
I've never been to a place so big!

34:24.109 --> 34:26.319
-Hi.
-Hey.

34:27.404 --> 34:28.488
Hi.

34:28.822 --> 34:30.240
I missed you.

34:31.700 --> 34:33.994
I can never tell when you're bullshitting.

34:34.077 --> 34:35.871
-Your place is amazing! Hi!
-Thank you.

34:35.954 --> 34:37.956
-This is Chloe.
-Thank you, thank you.

34:38.540 --> 34:40.250
Hi, I don't think we've met before.

34:40.333 --> 34:43.044
We haven't. I'm Izaak.

34:43.128 --> 34:44.463
It's a pleasure to meet you.

34:44.546 --> 34:46.173
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?

34:46.256 --> 34:49.092
-Yeah, of course. There's one right--
-I'll find it.

34:50.302 --> 34:52.596
-You have a pool?
-I have two.

34:53.930 --> 34:55.140
You wanna go for a swim?

34:56.266 --> 34:57.893
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God. Yes!

35:00.270 --> 35:01.897
Thank you so much.

35:16.203 --> 35:17.037
Guess who?

35:18.997 --> 35:20.123
Hi.

35:20.207 --> 35:21.416
Hey.

35:24.252 --> 35:25.879
How did you get here?

35:26.963 --> 35:28.924
I followed you home.

35:31.468 --> 35:33.428
I came with Tedros.

35:33.512 --> 35:35.055
You know Tedros?

35:35.138 --> 35:37.099
God, you're stunning.

35:37.182 --> 35:39.559
Of course, I know Tedros.
Everyone knows Tedros.

35:41.561 --> 35:43.396
But I wanna know you.

35:44.648 --> 35:46.650
Do you wanna dance?

35:47.734 --> 35:48.944
-Let's dance.
-Okay.

35:49.027 --> 35:51.196
Baby girl, I can tell

35:51.279 --> 35:55.033
that you think that I'm right for you

35:56.410 --> 36:00.789
I already know that
it's not true, but girl

36:02.124 --> 36:03.250
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

36:03.333 --> 36:06.294
Eyes, eyes, everyone, eyes, eyes.

36:06.378 --> 36:08.380
It's wrong

36:10.549 --> 36:12.884
It's wrong

36:12.968 --> 36:18.515
Even though it's wrong, baby

36:29.860 --> 36:31.445
-Hey, Leia.
-Yes?

36:31.528 --> 36:33.155
You ever done cocaine?

36:35.699 --> 36:36.658
Not really.

36:44.332 --> 36:47.252
You're gonna take it like this, in a fist.

36:47.335 --> 36:48.587
I have to get up early and--

36:48.670 --> 36:49.629
-Yes.
-Look at me.

36:49.713 --> 36:51.298
-Yes?
-You can't trust me?

36:52.048 --> 36:55.010
I trust-- Well, I just met you, but--

36:55.093 --> 36:56.136
But do you trust me?

36:59.473 --> 37:00.432
I'll try.

37:02.517 --> 37:04.019
Baby! There you go. Do some more.

37:09.649 --> 37:11.068
Where did she go?

37:11.610 --> 37:15.739
Even though it's wrong

37:17.491 --> 37:19.117
It's wrong

37:20.368 --> 37:25.791
Even though it's wrong, baby

37:26.416 --> 37:28.126
My girl

37:30.921 --> 37:37.552
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

37:38.095 --> 37:39.346
-Good.
-Yes.

37:39.638 --> 37:43.475
-Here it is.
-Yeah, it's beautiful.

37:43.558 --> 37:44.434
Big throw.

37:53.902 --> 37:57.197
A toast, to the end of my career.

38:00.617 --> 38:02.452
I'm not drinking to that.

38:04.913 --> 38:06.998
Wait. Can we just...

38:08.375 --> 38:10.502
-Oh, we can.
-Talk for a second?

38:11.002 --> 38:12.003
Talk?

38:14.881 --> 38:16.550
How did you meet Tedros?

38:18.593 --> 38:19.511
What happened?

38:19.594 --> 38:20.971
I was at my music video shoot

38:21.054 --> 38:21.972
and I...

38:22.514 --> 38:23.765
I started crying a little bit,

38:23.849 --> 38:25.892
and then I, I couldn't stop crying

38:25.976 --> 38:27.978
so we had to call it a day.

38:28.061 --> 38:29.187
Are you okay?

38:30.313 --> 38:31.398
Yeah.

38:32.023 --> 38:34.067
I'll be okay if they don't cancel my tour.

38:36.153 --> 38:40.532
I used to sing at a church in Ladera.

38:40.615 --> 38:42.492
Both my parents were pastors there.

38:43.785 --> 38:46.538
Tedros was at a service one day.

38:46.621 --> 38:48.498
-Really?
-Yeah.

38:48.582 --> 38:50.459
-Randomly.
-I would've not expected him

38:50.542 --> 38:53.587
to be into church.

38:53.670 --> 38:56.131
No, you'd be surprised. I mean,

38:57.883 --> 38:59.593
he's very godly.

38:59.676 --> 39:01.428
They're not canceling your tour,
all right?

39:01.511 --> 39:02.637
-No.
-You don't think so?

39:02.721 --> 39:05.640
-No.
-Yeah, but I'm unreliable.

39:05.724 --> 39:08.226
Unreliable? Who gives a fuck?
Look at this.

39:08.310 --> 39:09.644
I'm unreliable. They can't rely on me.

39:09.728 --> 39:11.104
-They can't--
-Yes, they can. You're fucking--

39:11.188 --> 39:12.105
They'll figure it out.

39:12.189 --> 39:14.107
You are fucking Jocelyn, okay?

39:14.649 --> 39:17.444
The American Dream. Rags to Riches.

39:17.527 --> 39:20.781
Trailers to Mansions. That's you, right?

39:20.864 --> 39:22.407
-That's me?
-Yeah, you've been a star

39:22.491 --> 39:24.910
your whole fuckin' life.
You're gonna forget how to do that now?

39:30.040 --> 39:34.377
Yeah, he heard me sing,
and the next thing I knew, he signed me.

39:35.420 --> 39:37.714
Wait, sorry. He signed-- To what?

39:37.798 --> 39:39.424
-What did he sign you to?
-Yeah.

39:40.383 --> 39:42.803
his label, his management.

39:43.762 --> 39:45.347
Oh, he's like a manager.

39:45.430 --> 39:49.017
Delicious, juicy ass. Oh, my God.

39:50.977 --> 39:53.605
I would fucking devour you. Yeah.

39:56.108 --> 39:58.819
Yeah. I mean,
he completely changed my life.

39:58.902 --> 40:00.112
He...

40:01.613 --> 40:02.948
He transformed me.

40:05.242 --> 40:06.576
Like how?

40:07.327 --> 40:10.997
By pushing me further
than anyone's ever pushed me before.

40:14.126 --> 40:15.252
What are you doing?

40:16.169 --> 40:18.171
Blockin' out all the noise.

40:19.423 --> 40:21.425
You're too distracted.

40:21.967 --> 40:24.219
Too much shit goin' around.

40:25.095 --> 40:26.513
I don't know.

40:26.596 --> 40:28.098
I think I just have to

40:29.558 --> 40:32.936
give them somebody they can rely on.

40:33.019 --> 40:34.563
-You know? Somebody they can--
-Fuck them.

40:34.646 --> 40:37.149
-Somebody they can invest in.
-Fuck them.

40:37.232 --> 40:41.278
If they can't rely on you,
they're in the wrong fuckin' business.

40:41.361 --> 40:44.573
The night we meet, we talk about
"When Doves Cry"

40:44.656 --> 40:47.284
and you got a fuckin' Prince
photo in your house?

40:48.326 --> 40:52.581
What are the fuckin' chances?
There are no coincidences in life.

40:53.749 --> 40:54.875
I'm a mess.

40:58.712 --> 41:00.338
I am. I'm a mess.

41:00.964 --> 41:03.592
I'd bet a billion dollars on this mess.

41:03.675 --> 41:04.885
Really?

41:06.511 --> 41:10.348
If only the world could see
what I'm looking at right now.

42:03.151 --> 42:06.029
I want you to get that robe
from my closet

42:06.113 --> 42:11.201
tie it around my face
and fuck me till you feel me black out.

42:16.748 --> 42:17.833
Wait here.

43:19.728 --> 43:21.938
Yeah. All right. Turn around, turn around.

43:22.022 --> 43:23.648
Let me see those titties.

43:37.496 --> 43:39.247
Walk over to the bed.

43:40.207 --> 43:42.834
Yeah, right here, right here. Perfect.

43:47.047 --> 43:48.131
So fuckin' sexy.

43:49.966 --> 43:52.010
Come on, get on the bed.
Show me how sexy you are.

43:57.099 --> 43:59.101
Oh, yeah. Just like that, baby.

43:59.684 --> 44:00.685
Yeah.

44:03.146 --> 44:05.440
I wish you could see
what I'm lookin' at right now.

44:07.692 --> 44:09.528
How beautiful you look.

44:10.278 --> 44:12.280
You look like a treat.

44:14.491 --> 44:16.368
Imagine my tongue on your pussy.

44:17.244 --> 44:18.495
My fat tongue.

44:21.957 --> 44:23.959
I wanna grab you by the ass

44:24.626 --> 44:26.628
while I suffocate you with my cock.

44:29.172 --> 44:31.133
I want you to choke on it.

44:36.221 --> 44:40.225
Oh, yeah, just like that, baby.
Turn around for me, baby.

44:41.059 --> 44:42.894
You're gonna make me
come over there, baby.

44:43.770 --> 44:47.399
You're gonna make me act a fool.
Yeah. Bend down for me.

44:47.482 --> 44:50.318
Yeah. Jesus Christ. Yeah, yeah.

44:51.987 --> 44:53.989
Oh, yeah. Just like that, baby.

44:54.614 --> 44:55.615
Yeah.

44:56.658 --> 44:59.494
Oh, yeah, ride it. Ride it slowly.

44:59.578 --> 45:01.663
Yeah. Put your finger down your throat

45:01.747 --> 45:03.832
and make that,
make that throat wet for me. Yeah.

45:05.667 --> 45:08.128
Oh, yeah. Turn around for me, baby.
Turn around.

45:10.505 --> 45:13.091
Open your legs. Yeah, yes, yes.

45:13.175 --> 45:15.385
Oh, yeah. Choke on-- Yeah, choke on it.

45:16.386 --> 45:19.014
Fuckin' stretch that tiny, little pussy.

45:25.353 --> 45:26.980
I want you to suck my cock.

45:41.745 --> 45:44.664
Oh, yeah. Just like that. Yeah.

45:51.046 --> 45:52.172
Oh, my God.

45:58.553 --> 46:00.097
Oh, my God!

46:17.823 --> 46:20.033
Why don't we hand the label three songs?

46:20.700 --> 46:22.536
Knock it out in two weeks.

46:24.121 --> 46:25.038
Okay.

46:38.718 --> 46:41.930
I mean, it'd be easier if I moved in,
ya know?

46:43.682 --> 46:45.308
For work purposes.

46:56.319 --> 46:57.946
I'd like that.

47:18.633 --> 47:20.051
Who is that?

47:22.929 --> 47:24.306
It's Chloe.

47:26.391 --> 47:29.978
Arms like branches of a poplar tree

47:30.061 --> 47:35.233
Eyes like the ocean
or the great big blue sea

47:35.317 --> 47:36.902
She's really good.

47:36.985 --> 47:40.781
Love just like my mother's
with a price it's not free

47:43.825 --> 47:46.203
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

47:46.286 --> 47:49.956
Oh-oh-oh-oh

47:52.000 --> 47:54.294
Voice like my father's

47:54.377 --> 47:57.923
When he screams, the house shakes

47:58.006 --> 48:03.929
Dreams like my brother's,
oh, we pray for his sake

48:04.012 --> 48:09.643
Hope like my mother's,
they last till her wake

48:09.726 --> 48:14.231
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

48:14.314 --> 48:18.235
Oh-oh-oh-oh

48:19.444 --> 48:23.657
That's my family

48:24.908 --> 48:28.870
We don't like each other very much

48:28.954 --> 48:34.292
Ohh, I'm okay with that

48:34.376 --> 48:38.505
But it breaks my mother's heart

48:41.049 --> 48:44.886
That's my family

48:46.138 --> 48:50.559
We don't like each other very much

48:51.017 --> 48:54.813
Ohh, I'm okay with that

48:56.022 --> 49:00.026
But it breaks my mother's heart

49:02.070 --> 49:06.283
That's my family

49:06.950 --> 49:11.121
We don't like each other very much

49:11.204 --> 49:15.375
Oh, I'm okay with that

49:16.418 --> 49:19.379
But it breaks my mother's heart

49:19.463 --> 49:22.340
Breaks my mother's heart

49:22.424 --> 49:26.428
That's my family

49:27.596 --> 49:31.975
We don't like each other very much

49:32.058 --> 49:36.229
Oh, I'm okay with that

49:36.313 --> 49:41.526
And it breaks my mother's heart

49:42.861 --> 49:47.657
That's my family

49:47.741 --> 49:52.162
-We don't like each other very much
-Each other very much

49:52.245 --> 49:56.625
-Oh, I'm okay with that
-I'm okay with that

49:56.708 --> 50:01.379
But it breaks my mother's heart

50:03.256 --> 50:07.886
That's my family

50:07.969 --> 50:12.390
We don't like each other very much

50:12.474 --> 50:16.561
Oh, I'm okay with that

50:16.645 --> 50:20.190
But it breaks my mother's heart

50:27.030 --> 50:28.907
I love to love you, baby

50:28.990 --> 50:29.950
Oh

50:30.033 --> 50:34.329
I love to love you, baby

I love to love you, baby

50:40.001 --> 50:43.672
I love to love you, baby

50:44.673 --> 50:47.008
Do it to me again and again

50:47.092 --> 50:50.387
You put me in such
an awful spin, in a spin

50:50.470 --> 50:52.431
In, uh...

51:19.958 --> 51:24.379
Oh, love to love you, baby

51:24.963 --> 51:29.384
Oh, love to love you, baby

Oh, love to love you, baby

51:49.488 --> 51:51.656
Oh

Love to love you, baby
