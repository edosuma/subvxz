03:10.226 --> 03:11.425
Man is omnipotent.

03:11.826 --> 03:13.909
Nothing is impossible for him.

03:13.909 --> 03:16.512
What seemed to be unthinkable
undertakings yesterday

03:16.616 --> 03:18.283
are history today.

03:18.387 --> 03:20.470
The conquest of the moon
for example,

03:20.574 --> 03:22.336
who talks about it anymore?

03:22.781 --> 03:25.573
Today we are already on the threshold
of conquering our galaxy.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.760
And in the not too distant tomorrow

03:27.968 --> 03:30.467
We'll be considering the conquest
of the universe.

03:30.571 --> 03:34.008
And yet man seems to ignore
the fact that on this very planet

03:34.008 --> 03:38.278
there are still people living in the stone age
and practicing cannibalism.

03:38.382 --> 03:41.611
Primitive tribes isolated
in ruthless hostile environments

03:41.715 --> 03:44.735
where the prevailing law is
survival of the fittest.

03:44.735 --> 03:49.005
And this jungle which its inhabitants refer to
as the Green Inferno

03:49.005 --> 03:52.441
is only a few hours flying time
from New York City.

03:52.546 --> 03:54.733
Was it to remind us of this
that four brave young Americans

03:54.837 --> 03:57.857
went there to make a documentary
on life in the jungle?

03:57.961 --> 04:00.148
Was it also to remind us,
for instance,

04:00.148 --> 04:02.127
that before
venturing into space

04:02.127 --> 04:05.355
we should become more acquainted with
the planet that we live on?

04:05.459 --> 04:09.000
Four young and fearless Americans,
children of the space age:

04:09.000 --> 04:12.437
armed with cameras, microphones,
and curiosity:

04:12.645 --> 04:15.978
Alan Yates.  A director famous
for his documentaries

04:16.082 --> 04:17.956
on Vietnam and Africa.

04:17.956 --> 04:21.459
Faye Daniels.
His girlfriend and script girl.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.946
And their two cameramen
and inseparable friends,

04:23.946 --> 04:28.270
Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso.

04:28.579 --> 04:30.766
Four youngsters who never came back.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.328
But let's have a look at them

04:32.432 --> 04:34.932
at the beginning of
their incredible adventure,

04:35.036 --> 04:37.327
here at the border between
Brazil and Peru.

04:37.431 --> 04:40.347
They are about to board a plane
to take them to the Rio Ocoro,

04:40.451 --> 04:43.784
a last outpost from which
they will continue on foot...

04:43.888 --> 04:45.450
deep into the Amazon Jungle...

04:45.554 --> 04:48.574
into the area known as
the Green Inferno.

04:49.253 --> 04:51.803
Hey, are you really not scared?

04:52.532 --> 04:56.489
Not at all.  I 've been in plenty of
other dangerous places with them.

04:56.593 --> 04:58.051
What about you, Alan?

04:58.156 --> 05:00.759
Well there's only one thing
scares me--

05:00.863 --> 05:03.154
and that's marriage.

05:03.675 --> 05:06.487
He'd take me to the North Pole
to put it off.

05:06.695 --> 05:09.195
I'd say he's succeeded
this time too.

05:09.299 --> 05:11.278
And this is the last time.

05:11.382 --> 05:13.893
Yeah, provided
we come back in one piece.

05:14.194 --> 05:16.656
Alright, alright... Let's go.

05:16.730 --> 05:21.067
Well, you four certainly aren't the first
to embark on such an adventure.

05:21.069 --> 05:25.964
There was an expedition in
'59, and another in '67,

05:26.066 --> 05:27.836
and neither of them came back.

05:27.836 --> 05:30.652
Ah, yeah, that was Smith and
that bunch of Frenchmen.

05:30.714 --> 05:31.414
- Yes.

05:31.481 --> 05:35.230
Yeah, Frenchmen, they were amateurs,
a bunch of jerks.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.157
They never succeeded
in doing anything.

05:37.522 --> 05:39.292
For us the difficult doesn't exist.

05:39.292 --> 05:41.921
The impossible takes just
a little more time.

05:42.025 --> 05:43.025
We'll be back.

05:44.168 --> 05:45.964
We have Felipe our guide.

05:46.004 --> 05:47.304
Say hi.

05:57.205 --> 05:59.704
Those are the last pictures
we have of them.

05:59.808 --> 06:02.412
Two months have passed
since they were last heard from.

06:02.412 --> 06:03.557
Are they still alive?

06:03.661 --> 06:05.848
And if so,  where are they?

06:05.953 --> 06:08.556
These are the questions
that the rescue team sponsored by

06:08.556 --> 06:11.889
New York University and the
Pan American Broadcasting System

06:11.889 --> 06:13.867
hope to be able to answer.

06:15.638 --> 06:18.762
Thank you for accepting Professor Monroe.
Good luck.

06:19.804 --> 06:23.449
Professor Harold Monroe,
NYU's noted anthropologist

06:23.553 --> 06:26.989
has taken part in various expeditions
exploring primitive cultures.

06:26.989 --> 06:30.218
But this will be his
first journey into Amazonia.

08:06.064 --> 08:08.025
Ugha...

08:13.865 --> 08:14.915
Help him!

09:22.767 --> 09:23.817
Enough.

09:30.191 --> 09:32.851
Look at what he's carrying...
a lighter!

09:44.122 --> 09:45.180
Poor Oliveira,

09:45.790 --> 09:47.098
He was only 20 years old.

09:48.960 --> 09:51.578
Once it hits the bloodstream,
there is nothing one can do.

09:52.839 --> 09:54.798
Better a bullet than a dart
from a blowgun.

09:55.633 --> 09:57.843
But we gave him the serum
at the right time.

09:58.010 --> 09:59.219
Sure, the serum

10:00.138 --> 10:01.847
It only works half the time...

10:02.932 --> 10:05.100
if it isn't already too old
by the time we get it.

10:09.981 --> 10:13.692
The guys won't give a shit
after the death of Oliveira.

10:14.110 --> 10:15.360
And they are right.

10:15.570 --> 10:17.279
In a short while
the American is arriving

10:17.447 --> 10:19.230
and we've got orders to help him.

10:19.760 --> 10:24.762
He's lucky.  A Yacumo prisoner is like
a passport into the Green Inferno.

11:39.522 --> 11:40.668
Here you are Lieutenant.

11:49.312 --> 11:51.915
Well Professor Monroe...
- Do you think you can turn that--?

11:52.644 --> 11:54.413
Thanks.
-  All I can say is that

11:54.415 --> 11:58.580
you anthropologists and the missionaries
are made out of special stuff.

11:58.685 --> 12:01.080
If hell holes like this didn't exist,

12:01.080 --> 12:02.954
I'm sure you would invent one.

12:02.954 --> 12:05.246
Whereas I'd give both my...

12:05.350 --> 12:07.849
well let's say I'd give anything
to be somewhere else.

12:08.370 --> 12:09.515
Look, Lieutenant.

12:09.620 --> 12:12.223
I'll be as little trouble as possible,
it's just...

12:12.327 --> 12:14.202
I'm sure you got
enough problems of your own.

12:14.306 --> 12:16.285
I'll have to be honest with you...

12:16.389 --> 12:17.743
No, no thanks...

12:18.159 --> 12:21.596
I need your help
in organizing this expedition.

12:21.804 --> 12:23.158
How can I refuse?

12:23.575 --> 12:25.574
You have been
recommended by everybody

12:25.576 --> 12:27.465
in our community as well as yours.

12:27.532 --> 12:29.094
If only I sure can
guarantee that you'll

12:29.198 --> 12:31.281
still be breathing
when you return.

12:33.468 --> 12:37.322
Look, I know this is not going
to be a picnic, believe me.

12:37.530 --> 12:39.821
This is not my first trip into bush.

12:41.071 --> 12:43.362
A skunk must have pissed that.

12:50.027 --> 12:51.173
Lieutenant...

12:52.839 --> 12:55.651
this lighter belonged
to Faye Daniels.

12:55.859 --> 12:59.504
Come with me, Professor.
I'll introduce you to your guide.

12:59.608 --> 13:02.732
He's the best there is,
if you can get along with him.

13:07.310 --> 13:09.582
This looks like shit.
It needs cleaning, no?

13:09.584 --> 13:12.500
Hey Chaco! This is Professor Monroe.

13:13.667 --> 13:18.250
Hello.  It's nice to meet you.
The lieutenant here was telling me

13:18.354 --> 13:20.645
what a...
what an excellent guide you are.

13:20.645 --> 13:22.624
You gonna take all of this
with you in the jungle?

13:22.728 --> 13:26.165
Yes, well forget it.
We're gonna need some weapons...

13:26.165 --> 13:28.352
some ammunition plus some medicine,

13:28.456 --> 13:29.810
that's all we need.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.101
I already told your friends.

13:32.205 --> 13:35.017
In there, the more you carry,
the quicker you get tired,

13:35.017 --> 13:36.475
the sooner you die.

13:37.412 --> 13:38.662
Alright, alright...

13:38.870 --> 13:40.849
All I wanna know Mr. Chaco is

13:40.953 --> 13:45.000
do we have a chance...
of finding them alive?

13:45.743 --> 13:46.993
Who's to say?

13:47.097 --> 13:49.180
The only thing I know is
we're gonna risk our lives

13:49.284 --> 13:50.982
to save those fuckers.

13:51.090 --> 13:52.925
Let's go see the Yacumo.

13:55.845 --> 13:57.720
Great warriors, these Yacumos!

13:57.824 --> 14:01.037
They're afraid of no one
except for the Tree People.

14:01.218 --> 14:03.656
Tree People?  No white man
has ever seen them.

14:03.656 --> 14:06.676
- Or the ones who have,
never lived to tell about it.

14:11.258 --> 14:12.716
Did you see this?

14:12.821 --> 14:15.216
Looks like the sacred scar of Ateri.

14:16.778 --> 14:18.965
That's what it is.
He's a son of a shaman

14:19.069 --> 14:21.464
and he's been consecrated
to the spirit of the jaguar,

14:21.569 --> 14:24.693
Which also explains what they were doing
this far from home.

14:24.797 --> 14:25.943
What do you mean?

14:26.047 --> 14:29.692
Ah, they were caught, yet they are
not really cannibals.

14:30.204 --> 14:32.274
Which means it was
probably some

14:32.333 --> 14:36.336
religious ceremony meant to chase
evil spirits outta the jungle...

14:37.502 --> 14:39.116
white men's spirits.

15:09.578 --> 15:11.141
Come on, Professor,

15:12.182 --> 15:14.057
Quit worrying about Yacumo!

15:14.057 --> 15:16.764
You can't afford to waste your strength
helping that savage.

15:21.347 --> 15:22.700
He'll outlive all of us!

15:44.466 --> 15:45.820
Can you make it?

15:52.277 --> 15:53.423
We'll have to wade across.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.970
But there's no piranhas here.
Come on!

16:06.913 --> 16:07.478
Come on...come on!

16:07.482 --> 16:09.648
There may not
be any piranhas,

16:09.704 --> 16:11.685
but there's always
a few hungry cavemen around.

16:27.998 --> 16:29.352
Leeches!

16:52.055 --> 16:53.201
Leave that shit alone.

16:53.305 --> 16:55.384
He can't do it by himself
and there's three of us here,

16:55.388 --> 16:57.262
Why can't we help him?
- Don't try this again Professor.

16:57.366 --> 16:59.345
Here, we do as I say,
and this bastard

16:59.449 --> 17:02.157
has to know
who is the strongest.

17:02.261 --> 17:04.240
Chaco's right, señor.
This guy's completely full of hate.

17:04.344 --> 17:06.739
As soon as you don't look,
he will slit your throat.

17:26.839 --> 17:30.484
They passed this way.
Yacumos dig a hole to cook.

17:36.628 --> 17:38.295
And it means...

17:38.295 --> 17:41.523
We're following the same trail,
right? Right.

19:02.650 --> 19:04.317
Hey, Professor!

19:04.421 --> 19:06.295
I recognize these teeth.

19:06.399 --> 19:08.274
This is Felipe Ocaña.

19:08.691 --> 19:11.141
He knew the jungle as well as I do.

19:12.231 --> 19:14.314
That makes me feel terrific.

19:14.894 --> 19:16.814
I wonder what was his mistake.

19:25.145 --> 19:28.894
See that? We're near his village;
he can already smell his home.

19:29.290 --> 19:30.986
<i>Hey!
Hey!</i>

19:31.268 --> 19:31.914
Mira!

19:33.789 --> 19:34.830
Here comes dinner...

19:34.830 --> 19:35.664
Hey. Mira!

19:35.768 --> 19:36.705
A muskrat!

19:36.809 --> 19:38.996
Today we eat meat, OK?

19:40.975 --> 19:44.203
This is Miguel ... hurry up I'm hungry

20:00.866 --> 20:02.845
It's dying that's for sure...

20:04.719 --> 20:07.011
Hey, Chaco, what the hell are you doing?

20:07.115 --> 20:08.677
It's for our Yacumo friend.

20:08.781 --> 20:10.239
A little bit of this stuff

20:10.239 --> 20:13.467
and he'll forget all about
trying to run away tonight.

20:13.572 --> 20:15.446
Atalaka, catra!

20:21.799 --> 20:24.611
This will make him very happy,
just wait and see.

20:24.715 --> 20:26.381
Drug addicts in the jungle.

20:30.547 --> 20:32.392
Hey, give him some of this.

20:32.418 --> 20:34.132
A little muskrat stomach.

20:34.455 --> 20:35.737
He'll love it.

20:37.420 --> 20:41.794
You like it?   Eat it it's all yours.
Go on stuff yourself.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.094
What the hell is that?

21:38.052 --> 21:42.635
I swear, that looks like a ritualistic
punishment for adultery. That's what it is.

21:42.637 --> 21:47.750
Just sit back and enjoy the show, because
afterwards he's gonna take us to the village.

23:00.013 --> 23:01.209
Don't be a fool!

23:01.280 --> 23:02.387
Come on, Professor!

23:57.889 --> 24:00.499
That punishment is considered
a divine commandment.

24:00.603 --> 24:03.823
If he had not killed her,
the tribe would have killed him.

24:04.787 --> 24:05.810
Here he comes!

24:20.158 --> 24:22.005
Follow him!

24:29.584 --> 24:32.231
Well, it is no masterpiece,
but it'll do.

24:32.253 --> 24:33.953
Can you guess
what it is for, Professor?

24:34.005 --> 24:36.194
Oh let me try Chaco,
please let me try...

24:36.196 --> 24:38.462
Okay, is it possible that this way
they won't know

24:38.488 --> 24:40.730
how many of us there are until
we talk with them, huh?

24:41.050 --> 24:42.748
He's learning fast eh, Miguel?

24:42.825 --> 24:44.960
Terrific, just terrific!

24:55.300 --> 24:56.282
They're coming.

24:56.315 --> 24:57.957
Where?
I don't see a thing.

24:58.572 --> 24:59.617
Don't worry, they are there

24:59.619 --> 25:02.611
I know they're there, I know they're there,
 but where?!   I don't see anything.

25:02.613 --> 25:04.279
Come on, let's send out
our ambassador.

25:04.471 --> 25:05.525
Come on Miguel.

25:08.658 --> 25:11.303
Good luck Miguel!
- Fuck good luck!

25:12.098 --> 25:13.399
Come on boy.

25:46.181 --> 25:47.510
We may be in trouble.

25:47.581 --> 25:50.223
Good... you've raised
deductive reasoning to an art.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.384
Instinct.

25:51.386 --> 25:54.719
Something says your friends have
made quite a mess of things.

26:01.969 --> 26:03.433
Wait!

26:03.972 --> 26:07.337
If Miguel pulls this off,
I swear I'll buy him a bottle of whiskey.

26:17.030 --> 26:21.404
This is supposed to demonstrate
their good intentions.

26:28.051 --> 26:30.244
There, they're going
to show themselves now.

27:00.507 --> 27:01.532
Where the hell are you going?

27:01.532 --> 27:02.712
They're going to lead you
right into an ambush.

27:02.924 --> 27:04.810
No, this is a
good sign Professor.

27:05.185 --> 27:07.059
Oh yeah?
You could have fooled me.

27:07.164 --> 27:09.455
They just want to show us
they are brave warriors.

27:09.455 --> 27:11.850
And, they want us to follow them
to their village.

27:11.954 --> 27:13.100
Follow them?

27:13.204 --> 27:15.854
Yeah, to return the prisoner
and to talk.

27:16.016 --> 27:17.578
Listen, I do not know about this.

27:17.682 --> 27:19.290
I think they want us
for dinner tonight.

28:01.339 --> 28:02.463
Chaco...

28:07.150 --> 28:09.129
Pretend you've seen nothing.

28:10.691 --> 28:12.357
Okay.

29:26.923 --> 29:28.069
Friends shot him.

29:28.069 --> 29:30.673
Let's hope he doesn't
die from the wound.

29:30.777 --> 29:32.235
Get busy, Miguel!

30:05.977 --> 30:09.101
You can breathe easy...
It's alright now, Professor.

30:26.181 --> 30:27.430
Kimnamma.

30:28.368 --> 30:29.513
Cheers, Professor!

30:29.617 --> 30:32.846
You now have the rare honor
of drinking Hisimo.

30:36.699 --> 30:38.025
Yeah.

31:07.213 --> 31:08.567
The group we are looking for

31:08.671 --> 31:10.858
is probably headed for
the center of the jungle

31:10.962 --> 31:12.733
or the center of the Matos,

31:12.837 --> 31:15.232
which no white man
has ever seen before.

31:16.169 --> 31:21.064
This area is under the domination
of two cannibal tribes.

31:21.272 --> 31:23.980
They are so fierce, they are feared
by all other tribes in the area.

31:23.980 --> 31:27.313
Including the tough courageous warriors
of the Yacumo Tribe.

31:27.521 --> 31:29.500
These are the two super powers
of the Green Inferno,

31:29.604 --> 31:31.374
perpetually at war with each other.

31:31.374 --> 31:33.145
The Yanomano or Tree People.

31:33.249 --> 31:36.894
and Shamatari, the Swamp People.

31:36.998 --> 31:38.664
Each considers the other fair game.

31:38.664 --> 31:39.497
Hunted...

31:39.706 --> 31:41.268
then eaten.

31:42.830 --> 31:44.600
This will keep you high and dry.

31:44.600 --> 31:45.850
No, thanks.

31:48.245 --> 31:49.703
<i>The Yacumo
blame the Alan Yates' crew</i>

31:49.807 --> 31:51.474
<i>for the great calamity
that befell them.</i>

31:51.578 --> 31:53.348
<i>exactly what happened
remains a mystery.</i>

31:53.348 --> 31:56.056
<i>We only know
that the four whites had--</i>

31:56.264 --> 31:57.799
Hey! Shut that up!

31:59.180 --> 32:00.638
God, we're in
the middle of a hunt.

32:00.742 --> 32:01.676
Tree people or --?

32:01.678 --> 32:04.021
Both. Hunting each other.
Let’s get going.

32:20.347 --> 32:21.571
Up there.

32:21.839 --> 32:24.234
Shamatari tribe
flushing their prey.

35:06.433 --> 35:09.100
<i>Despite the fact that our intervention
saved them from the Shamatari,</i>

35:09.547 --> 35:12.047
<i>the tree people, although they welcomed
us into their territory</i>

35:12.047 --> 35:14.130
<i>continue to behave
strangely towards us...</i>

35:14.234 --> 35:16.837
<i>with a mixture
of fear and distrust.</i>

35:18.734 --> 35:22.233
<i>Nevertheless we've been permitted to observe
the execution of one of their warriors.</i>

35:22.675 --> 35:24.419
<i>Death by mutilation.</i>

35:24.696 --> 35:27.091
<i>A criminal
thwarted by the chief.</i>

35:36.256 --> 35:38.033
Criminal from the way he
was destroyed.

35:38.035 --> 35:41.767
He must have done something horrible
to incur the wrath of his own people.

35:41.769 --> 35:44.433
It is not clear whether it was to pay
a debt of honor towrd us,

35:44.435 --> 35:47.629
or only to demonstrate
how they dispense justice?

35:48.128 --> 35:50.104
Careful,
they're referring to us.

36:20.913 --> 36:23.017
<i>We weren't able to get anything
out of the Yanomamo,</i>

36:23.201 --> 36:24.587
<i>except for the
wristwatch they gave us</i>

36:24.589 --> 36:27.184
<i>as a token
of their gratitude to an ally.</i>

36:27.186 --> 36:29.687
<i>An ally they
continue to fear and mistrust.</i>

36:30.115 --> 36:32.719
<i>So I decided to try
an experiment in psychology:</i>

36:32.927 --> 36:34.546
<i>to strip myself completely--</i>

36:34.697 --> 36:39.071
<i>clothes, weapons, dog tags, rings,
everything to become like them.</i>

36:39.176 --> 36:41.050
<i>Naked and unfettered as Adam.</i>

38:43.730 --> 38:46.646
<i>The Tree People would not let us
bury the ghastly remains</i>

38:46.751 --> 38:48.650
<i>that hey had painted ochre</i>

38:48.709 --> 38:51.229
<i>to drive away the evil spirits
which the dead represented.</i>

38:52.478 --> 38:53.624
<i>Once again I ask myself</i>

38:53.624 --> 38:57.894
<i>what unspeakable crime could have called
for such atrocious retribution.</i>

38:57.998 --> 38:59.873
<i>I know our lives
are hanging by a thread.</i>

38:59.977 --> 39:02.684
<i>But I can't turn back without
at least trying to recover</i>

39:02.789 --> 39:05.988
<i>the footage Alan Yates and the others
paid for with their lives.</i>

39:07.420 --> 39:11.503
<i>I'm thinking of the enormous human
and scientific interest it's going to contain.</i>

39:11.794 --> 39:13.564
<i>I must do something.</i>

39:13.982 --> 39:16.377
<i>Chaco and Miguel can't
possibly understand this.</i>

39:16.481 --> 39:20.231
<i>Yet, I must somehow gain
the confidence of these savages.</i>

39:20.439 --> 39:23.667
<i>After all,
they too have rules of conduct.</i>

39:30.541 --> 39:32.132
Hold it.

41:04.686 --> 41:06.456
You did it, God damn it!

41:06.560 --> 41:08.747
They just invited us to dinner.

42:32.146 --> 42:33.495
By some incredible act of God

42:33.497 --> 42:35.053
they hadn't tried to open it.

42:35.378 --> 42:37.452
I'm hoping the climate
hadn't damaged it too much.

42:37.557 --> 42:39.631
And so in exchange
for the tape recorder,

42:39.736 --> 42:43.443
the Cannibal chief let you
take away the cans of film. Is that it?

42:43.897 --> 42:46.993
Yes, they thought
since I was capable of capturing

42:46.995 --> 42:50.865
the human voice, I was also capable
of capturing their spirits.

42:51.047 --> 42:55.301
This convinced them that I was the only one
capable of breaking the evil spell

42:55.405 --> 42:57.170
that had been cast over the tribe

42:57.273 --> 42:59.244
by their murder of the whites.

42:59.349 --> 43:01.735
Of course, they had no inkling
of what was really in those cans.

43:01.943 --> 43:04.537
How could you explain
what a movie is?

43:04.537 --> 43:06.820
They just felt
they were a threat.

43:07.027 --> 43:08.584
Why do you say threat?

43:09.023 --> 43:11.096
Well the Yanomamo's understood
how important

43:11.098 --> 43:13.796
these film cans were to
Alan Yates's crew.

43:13.798 --> 43:16.496
They thought the silver boxes
contained his power.

43:17.148 --> 43:19.327
The power,
which I must say again,

43:19.583 --> 43:21.878
caused much damage and violence.

43:22.003 --> 43:25.033
A fantastic story.
Thank you, Professor Monroe.

43:25.127 --> 43:26.532
You're very welcome.

43:29.146 --> 43:31.118
As we conclude
this special interview

43:31.222 --> 43:34.440
we would like to remind you
Wednesday, at 9 pm,

43:34.543 --> 43:35.580
here on <i>Pantheon,</i>

43:35.684 --> 43:38.798
we'll be presenting part one
of <i>The Green Inferno</i>.

43:38.902 --> 43:42.014
The dramatic film testimony,
of an extraordinary adventure

43:42.118 --> 43:45.958
that took its protagonists
all the way back to the stone age.

43:46.380 --> 43:49.071
And you would be the ideal
host of the program?

43:49.336 --> 43:50.512
That's right.

43:50.850 --> 43:51.961
Professor Monroe,

43:52.273 --> 43:55.102
as an eye witness as well as a scientist,
you would be the most--

43:55.150 --> 43:59.418
Yes... but before I make
any decisions

43:59.543 --> 44:01.515
I'd like to review
all the film material.

44:01.617 --> 44:03.374
As of yet we've seen none of it.

44:04.222 --> 44:06.089
Professor Monroe, I can assure you

44:06.089 --> 44:08.165
that they knew
exactly what they wanted.

44:08.995 --> 44:09.929
That may be.

44:09.929 --> 44:11.797
But meanwhile,
they're all dead, aren't they?

44:11.797 --> 44:15.741
Which is exactly why we have
to let the public know the truth.

44:15.844 --> 44:17.504
We'll let the people be the judge.

44:17.608 --> 44:20.929
Better yet, we'll let the people
who knew them best be the judge.

44:21.033 --> 44:23.515
Their parents, their wives.

44:24.665 --> 44:27.411
This is a documentary
they shot for us

44:27.413 --> 44:28.906
about a year and a half ago.

44:29.190 --> 44:30.676
Can I start?
- Yes, please do.

45:59.316 --> 46:01.087
Pretty powerful stuff huh?

46:03.587 --> 46:07.234
Well just to give you an idea
how Alan and the others worked,

46:07.338 --> 46:09.423
everything that you just saw
was a put on.

46:10.465 --> 46:14.112
- You mean this was--
- That was no enemy army approaching.

46:14.217 --> 46:17.688
Alan paid those soldiers
to do a bit of acting.

46:19.114 --> 46:21.510
You'll have to excuse me now.
I'll join you later.

46:21.512 --> 46:23.179
Yes, thank you.

46:24.220 --> 46:25.991
Shall I go ahead?

46:26.824 --> 46:28.595
Yeah, good news.

46:31.458 --> 46:33.231
<i>(music from the film playing)</i>

46:34.652 --> 46:35.889
This is Jack...

46:39.120 --> 46:40.370
Faye...

46:41.620 --> 46:42.662
Alan...

46:45.476 --> 46:47.350
And this is Mark.

46:48.706 --> 46:50.394
They've worked together
for years.

46:50.477 --> 46:52.013
They were
terrible prima donnas,

46:52.041 --> 46:54.332
but I have to admit
they were real pros.  - Mm-hmm.

46:55.583 --> 46:57.562
The stuff they shot
could really gut punch you.

46:57.562 --> 46:58.812
Yeah,
 I can imagine.

47:00.168 --> 47:01.679
Their ratings were fantastic
you know,

47:01.681 --> 47:03.503
higher than most
of the big comics.

47:03.503 --> 47:05.377
And did they know
how to play an audience!

47:05.379 --> 47:06.526
Alan especially.

47:06.628 --> 47:08.712
Look at this bit
they shot before leaving:

47:08.816 --> 47:11.420
Yeah, we were coming back anyway.
We got Felipe our guide.

47:11.524 --> 47:13.448
Come on up here!

47:16.267 --> 47:18.706
Yeah, there we go.
okay.  Ha! Ha!

47:22.986 --> 47:24.511
This shot's dark because
the diaphragm setting

47:24.513 --> 47:26.282
on the camera
was wrong.

47:28.197 --> 47:30.072
There, now he's got it right.

47:44.556 --> 47:45.376
Forget it.

47:45.445 --> 47:47.369
There's no electricity
where we're going.

47:48.933 --> 47:51.536
Nope, this is anything but
a well organized

47:51.641 --> 47:53.336
safari with all the comforts.

47:54.768 --> 47:56.122
Weapons.

47:57.268 --> 47:58.493
Camera.

47:58.518 --> 48:00.602
Medicinal supplies.
That's about it!

48:00.707 --> 48:04.041
Since we'll be covering
hundreds of miles on foot.

48:06.334 --> 48:07.479
And that's another thing...

48:07.583 --> 48:09.981
Who knows when
we'll have another shower?

48:12.481 --> 48:14.061
Of course I don't think Faye
will have any problem

48:14.092 --> 48:16.715
remaining the sexiest script girl
in history.

48:18.733 --> 48:21.233
Are you really shooting?
Jerk!

48:21.235 --> 48:22.486
Okay, okay,
that's enough.

48:22.589 --> 48:25.298
Has anyone seen
my pants anywhere?

48:25.851 --> 48:27.798
What do you want those for?

48:27.800 --> 48:30.196
To put them on my head, stupid!

48:30.404 --> 48:32.383
I thought ever since Jack
took them off two years ago,

48:32.383 --> 48:34.051
you didn’t need 'em anymore.

48:34.053 --> 48:35.395
Right, Mark?

48:35.579 --> 48:37.073
Right!  Nicer to--

48:38.113 --> 48:39.765
Knock it off!

48:40.510 --> 48:41.968
Are you shooting again?

48:43.011 --> 48:44.157
You idiot.

48:45.511 --> 48:47.066
Crew of clowns.

48:47.179 --> 48:49.054
They had a great sense
of the theatrical.

48:49.054 --> 48:49.887
Like I said,

48:49.887 --> 48:51.660
they were
real professionals.

48:56.661 --> 48:58.745
Ah, what was
I saying, Professor?

48:59.599 --> 49:03.015
Yeah, I tried working
with Alan a couple times

49:03.016 --> 49:04.581
and I just couldn't handle it.

49:04.996 --> 49:08.643
You know he-- he pushed
his people to the limit.

49:08.748 --> 49:11.457
Demanding everything,
including blood.

49:11.457 --> 49:13.332
And talk about paranoia?

49:13.541 --> 49:17.813
God have mercy on his soul.
He was one ruthless son of a bitch!

49:17.917 --> 49:21.876
So I feel we have a duty
to tell the public their story Mr. Yates.

49:23.037 --> 49:24.582
Alan was alone...

49:31.046 --> 49:33.131
You know I really
appreciate your coming.

49:33.234 --> 49:35.319
You're the first person
to come and

49:35.423 --> 49:37.760
...and talk to me about Alan
after what happened.

49:38.861 --> 49:41.466
What I'd like to know Professor
 is...

49:41.466 --> 49:44.071
What did happen
to my son?

49:44.175 --> 49:45.946
Can you tell me?

49:46.467 --> 49:49.489
Faye - no, that wasn't
her real name.

49:49.593 --> 49:51.885
she always wanted
to be an actress

49:51.885 --> 49:53.449
her real name was Tina.

49:53.553 --> 49:55.116
Excuse me a minute.

49:56.054 --> 49:57.929
Children, look I'm just going to be

49:58.034 --> 50:01.681
speaking with this man one more minute.
And then we'll play.  Okay?

50:03.035 --> 50:07.411
As you can tell we're
very different in our characters.

50:07.515 --> 50:10.849
But Tina was very energetic,

50:10.849 --> 50:12.621
very hard working,

50:12.726 --> 50:15.955
very ambitious,
extremely ambitious.

50:16.373 --> 50:17.831
I used to say to her:

50:17.935 --> 50:21.478
"Do you think you'll ever
be at peace with yourself?"

50:21.582 --> 50:22.832
Anyway,

50:22.832 --> 50:26.167
Now she is...
God rest her soul.

50:26.271 --> 50:29.387
<i>Elizabeth! Elizabeth!</i>

50:29.918 --> 50:31.160
Excuse me, Ms. Anders,

50:31.168 --> 50:32.211
just two minutes.

50:32.627 --> 50:33.878
How did you feel about Jack?

50:33.878 --> 50:36.587
What's the use?
What am I supposed to say about Jack?

50:36.691 --> 50:38.150
After two years of marriage...

50:38.253 --> 50:40.546
I was with him for just for four months.

50:41.589 --> 50:42.838
What are you doing?

50:43.256 --> 50:44.506
I'll see ya.

50:46.590 --> 50:50.237
He was always on assignments.
India, Asia, Africa.

50:52.217 --> 50:56.385
Yeah, sure he was good in bed.
But, he liked to eat too.

50:56.488 --> 50:58.365
No brains though.

50:58.885 --> 51:00.656
To easily influenced.

51:02.220 --> 51:04.512
Alan was his god you know.

51:04.720 --> 51:06.179
You know what I mean?

51:07.429 --> 51:10.451
You guys think I can
get any bread out of this.

51:11.597 --> 51:13.473
Ah, Mr. Tomaso,
Mr. Tomaso please.

51:14.098 --> 51:15.348
Mr. Tomaso, please .

51:16.807 --> 51:18.788
I just want to ask you
one question about your son.

51:18.788 --> 51:20.037
Ya what do ya wanna ask me?

51:20.037 --> 51:23.268
Look, your son was a man of
special importance to the news world.

51:23.476 --> 51:25.247
Can you tell me
something about him?

51:25.351 --> 51:27.018
My son, my son was no good.

51:27.123 --> 51:28.790
He doesn't work
he doesn't go to school.

51:28.998 --> 51:30.665
Wants to lay
around the house all day.

51:30.665 --> 51:33.165
And he's no good period
 Now that's it.

51:33.165 --> 51:34.934
Now I gotta go back to my job.

51:34.938 --> 51:36.292
Don't bother me no more!

51:36.397 --> 51:39.026
But Mr. Tomaso, please,
your son was well known

51:39.028 --> 51:41.111
to a lot of people...
 just one question?

51:40.669 --> 51:42.023
Okay, one question,

51:42.128 --> 51:45.670
About your son, I just want to know
what kind of man was he?

51:45.775 --> 51:47.650
My son,
my son was a son of a bitch.

51:47.650 --> 51:49.004
And he was no good.

51:49.109 --> 51:50.567
That's it, my son is dead!

51:50.567 --> 51:52.443
I don't wanna talk about him
no more.

51:52.547 --> 51:54.210
Now leave me alone!
Good bye.

51:54.214 --> 51:56.611
Mr. Tomaso,
millions of Americans--

51:56.611 --> 51:58.111
Mr. Tomaso, please!

51:58.631 --> 52:00.184
Why didn't they
print the whole thing?

52:00.287 --> 52:02.359
The negative needed
special treatment

52:02.463 --> 52:03.912
because of the humidity.

52:04.016 --> 52:06.501
The quality isn't the best,
but its pretty good

52:06.501 --> 52:09.091
considering the lousy conditions
they were shooting in.

52:09.091 --> 52:11.059
Unfortunately two reels
were light fault.

52:11.162 --> 52:12.612
we had to throw them out.

52:12.716 --> 52:14.165
I put a piece of
black leader between

52:14.269 --> 52:15.512
one sequence and another.

52:15.615 --> 52:18.205
Good, that's where we will put
the interviews with the families.

52:18.205 --> 52:20.365
and the one in which you
talk about your search for them.

52:20.370 --> 52:22.617
- Mm-Hmm.
- Go ahead Bill.  -Okay.

52:27.733 --> 52:29.175
This first segment is silent.

52:44.304 --> 52:46.271
Evidently they didn't always
use their mics,

52:46.375 --> 52:47.825
though they were attached
right to the camera.

52:47.825 --> 52:51.663
just above the lens,
like a gun barrel... see?

52:53.728 --> 52:55.282
Remember this is a very rough cut,.

52:55.282 --> 52:56.835
almost like watching rushes.

52:56.939 --> 52:59.424
A lot of this stuff will be thrown out
in the actual editing.

52:59.529 --> 53:02.014
Here we are; there should be
some sound coming in now.

53:02.117 --> 53:03.464
No, no, not yet.

53:04.137 --> 53:05.207
Here.

53:05.499 --> 53:08.236
(laughing)

53:11.335 --> 53:12.474
Felipe.

53:38.621 --> 53:40.006
Hey, sweet matte.

53:42.094 --> 53:46.341
We've been walking for six days
in this marvelous inferno.

53:46.341 --> 53:50.173
Today is Saturday the 25th.

53:50.380 --> 53:55.455
If I were in New York right now,
I'd probably be out shopping.

54:13.268 --> 54:14.615
Get the camera.

54:22.071 --> 54:23.311
Damn thing.

54:32.015 --> 54:34.292
Wait, wait, wait...

57:53.223 --> 57:54.994
How much of the material
is without sound?

57:54.994 --> 57:56.653
- Less than half.
- Oh.

57:57.807 --> 57:59.474
Every so often
I laid in some stock music

57:59.578 --> 58:01.725
just to juice
things up a little.

58:05.829 --> 58:06.663
What is it?

58:06.767 --> 58:08.330
The Yacumos
passed this way

58:08.435 --> 58:10.205
We are not
far from the village.

58:12.085 --> 58:14.068
(screaming)

58:18.854 --> 58:19.583
Move away!

58:19.583 --> 58:21.458
Jack, get the shot!

58:21.563 --> 58:25.540
This is fucking dangerous.
-No, this is fucking cool man!

58:26.028 --> 58:27.749
Shut the fuck up!

58:50.840 --> 58:51.882
Looky here!

58:54.279 --> 58:56.258
We've been walking through
the jungle for days

58:56.362 --> 58:59.897
with the harrowing feeling that
we're moving in circles.

59:00.426 --> 59:03.131
At night we have to
sleep in the trees,

59:03.136 --> 59:05.531
so we don't get bit
by the snakes or spiders.

59:06.573 --> 59:09.596
Felipe, our guide,
claims we're near the big river

59:09.699 --> 59:11.981
where the Yacumos live
in their village.

59:12.230 --> 59:15.032
Look at my feet!
Fucking jungle!

59:19.701 --> 59:22.301
Alan, do you want some tea?

59:22.685 --> 59:24.691
(screaming)

59:25.224 --> 59:28.343
Ahhh!!! Puta! Puta!

59:29.078 --> 59:30.818
Cut off my leg!

59:30.954 --> 59:32.308
Cut off my leg!

59:32.517 --> 59:34.287
Puta!

59:34.287 --> 59:36.164
Kill it!
Kill it!

59:36.267 --> 59:38.664
Grab the leg.    -Hold him down.
Grab the leg!

59:38.768 --> 59:41.836
Hold him down.

59:41.897 --> 59:43.753
Hold him down!

59:44.082 --> 59:46.470
My God...Jesus Christ

59:46.479 --> 59:47.729
Cut off my leg!

59:48.874 --> 59:51.792
Cut it off!
Come on put it on the fire!

59:52.418 --> 59:53.931
Come on, do it!

59:54.151 --> 59:55.151
Do it!

59:56.689 --> 59:58.590
Are you still shooting?
- Yeah.

59:58.745 --> 01:00:00.336
Do it now!
- I'm gettin' it all.

01:00:00.753 --> 01:00:01.691
Do it!

01:00:45.243 --> 01:00:48.994
<i>Felipe was a great buddy
and a top-notch guy.</i>

01:00:49.964 --> 01:00:50.974
<i>We'll miss him.</i>

01:00:51.794 --> 01:00:54.294
<i>But even more we'll miss
the security he gave us.</i>

01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:58.150
<i>We decided to go on.</i>

01:00:58.254 --> 01:00:59.712
<i>But we've
only got the compass</i>

01:00:59.712 --> 01:01:01.844
<i>and our instincts
to show the way.</i>

01:01:07.422 --> 01:01:08.569
Panning to you Alan.

01:01:10.131 --> 01:01:12.528
Faye, give us some
earth shattering film takes.

01:01:12.528 --> 01:01:14.716
You know this is gonna
make us famous.

01:01:15.029 --> 01:01:16.799
You think so huh?
How famous?

01:01:17.217 --> 01:01:19.612
Real famous and real rich, man.

01:01:19.717 --> 01:01:21.059
What you going do
with your money?

01:01:21.064 --> 01:01:22.730
I'm gonna buy a house
and a piece a ass.

01:01:23.614 --> 01:01:24.519
Think that's funny huh?

01:01:24.521 --> 01:01:26.018
Yeah, that's the
only way you can get it.

01:01:26.906 --> 01:01:28.024
Where's Faye?

01:01:28.091 --> 01:01:30.345
I don't know.
Turn the camera off, will you?

01:01:42.223 --> 01:01:43.785
Christ, what's taking you so long?

01:01:43.785 --> 01:01:47.745
Well, I had to wait in line
with the rest of the animals.

01:01:48.161 --> 01:01:49.204
You're disgusting!

01:01:49.619 --> 01:01:52.150
Hey get outta here!   I told you to
get outta here with the camera.

01:01:52.152 --> 01:01:53.093
Hey, I just want a little peak.

01:01:53.095 --> 01:01:55.283
Will you get outta here!
- Get out of here.

01:01:55.872 --> 01:01:58.477
I told you
to turn the goddamn thing off.

01:01:58.658 --> 01:01:59.934
I'll get you!
- Whoo!

01:02:07.869 --> 01:02:10.265
Come on, push!

01:02:19.434 --> 01:02:20.684
Look there's a caiman.

01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:21.830
Get out of the water.

01:02:21.935 --> 01:02:23.289
No, no, forget about me.

01:02:23.289 --> 01:02:24.852
Film it, film it...

01:02:26.831 --> 01:02:29.123
Come on,
get on the raft you guys.

01:02:29.548 --> 01:02:31.180
Get on the raft,
hurry up!

01:02:31.417 --> 01:02:32.450
Snake!

01:02:35.034 --> 01:02:37.251
Ahh!
We're saved, we're saved!

01:02:37.356 --> 01:02:38.710
By the anaconda!

01:02:38.815 --> 01:02:41.002
Saved from
the jaws of death.

01:03:09.636 --> 01:03:10.993
Come on.

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:30.225
I wonder
where there village is?

01:03:30.225 --> 01:03:31.585
Just shoot in the air
and follow 'em.

01:03:32.155 --> 01:03:34.929
And when they scatter
how are we gonna get there?

01:04:25.118 --> 01:04:26.453
No, wait.

01:04:26.653 --> 01:04:28.068
I know what I'm doing.

01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:32.329
-  Why?
- Don't you get it?

01:04:32.331 --> 01:04:34.040
We can never keep up
with them in the jungle.

01:04:34.088 --> 01:04:36.361
This way that buck
will go slow enough

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:38.372
to take us
right to the village.

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:42.570
Well, what
do you think Professor?

01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:46.329
That it's not the best way of
establishing peace with the Yacumo tribe.

01:04:46.913 --> 01:04:48.524
You know,
I'm beginning to understand

01:04:48.526 --> 01:04:50.431
why they greeted us
with such hostility.

01:04:50.673 --> 01:04:52.918
Do you think this is bad?
This is nothing.

01:04:53.027 --> 01:04:55.231
Alan did much worse.
Just watch.

01:05:04.248 --> 01:05:06.115
They could play it rough
when they felt they had to.

01:05:06.218 --> 01:05:09.329
Remember how they
set-up some of those executions.

01:06:14.139 --> 01:06:15.179
Faye!

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.930
Here we are at the edge
of the world in human history.

01:06:56.967 --> 01:06:59.109
Things like this
happen all the time in the jungle.

01:06:59.111 --> 01:07:00.745
It's survival of the fittest.

01:07:01.254 --> 01:07:06.230
In the jungle it's the daily violence
of the strong overcoming the weak.

01:07:06.279 --> 01:07:07.530
Jack!

01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:15.622
Hiya!  Hiyah!

01:07:18.090 --> 01:07:20.739
Yiha!!  Hah!

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:23.972
Come on, get out!

01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:42.584
Jack a torch...

01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:51.309
Ready?

01:07:51.455 --> 01:07:52.935
Okay!

01:07:53.217 --> 01:07:57.232
The massacre of the Yacumos
by the Yanomamos.  - Right!

01:07:57.365 --> 01:07:59.739
A set-up...all a set-up!

01:08:00.062 --> 01:08:01.773
Just like Cambodia.

01:08:02.136 --> 01:08:04.044
Get this, fuckers!

01:08:07.452 --> 01:08:10.716
Heh?
- That's it.  That's it.

01:08:11.295 --> 01:08:13.021
Yah!

01:08:29.095 --> 01:08:31.865
Keep them inside.
Keep 'em inside!

01:08:36.251 --> 01:08:37.495
Get in, Get in.

01:08:47.761 --> 01:08:49.629
Get em' back inside.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.582
It's beautiful.

01:09:08.197 --> 01:09:10.450
Alan!  Here!

01:09:10.511 --> 01:09:11.511
Right!

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:46.304
Show 'em
how we do it, yeah?

01:12:39.473 --> 01:12:41.153
(laughter)

01:12:41.776 --> 01:12:45.615
Oh, fuck.
Oh, you motherfucker.

01:12:45.617 --> 01:12:47.600
Get the fuck outta here.

01:12:47.736 --> 01:12:48.884
Do you believe this?

01:12:48.988 --> 01:12:51.109
You fuckin' turkey.

01:12:55.044 --> 01:12:56.708
Whoo, I'm drained.

01:12:57.755 --> 01:13:00.035
You must admit
it's exceptional footage.

01:13:00.086 --> 01:13:03.939
I-I didn't expect
such impact, such authenticity.

01:13:04.043 --> 01:13:07.170
I don't-- I don't think exceptional
is the right word.

01:13:07.894 --> 01:13:10.186
You don't?

01:13:10.290 --> 01:13:11.344
No

01:13:11.346 --> 01:13:13.175
I mean, what's exceptional
about a primitive tribe

01:13:13.177 --> 01:13:15.477
like the Yacumo being terrorized

01:13:15.498 --> 01:13:18.355
and forced into to doing something that
they don't-- they don't normally do?

01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:20.830
Come on now Professor,

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:22.174
Let's be realistic

01:13:22.176 --> 01:13:25.010
Who knows anything
about the Yacumo civilization?

01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:27.424
Today people want sensationalism.

01:13:27.594 --> 01:13:29.985
The more you rape their senses
the happier they are.

01:13:30.093 --> 01:13:32.401
Ah yes, that's typical
western thought.

01:13:32.476 --> 01:13:35.647
civilized is it?   That's what Alan thought
and that's why he's dead.

01:13:36.029 --> 01:13:38.008
The Yacumo Indian
is a primitive.

01:13:38.193 --> 01:13:40.067
And he has to be
respected as such.

01:13:40.171 --> 01:13:42.445
You know, did you ever think
of the Yacumo point of view

01:13:42.447 --> 01:13:44.527
that we might be
the ones who are savages?

01:13:44.541 --> 01:13:46.067
Well, I never thought of it that way,

01:13:46.107 --> 01:13:48.430
but it's an interesting idea.
-  Yes.

01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:50.483
Let's say
things are reversed, right,

01:13:50.787 --> 01:13:52.468
and the Yacumo attacked
your house

01:13:52.479 --> 01:13:54.223
defiled everything
you held holy.

01:13:54.247 --> 01:13:56.124
You know that pig
that was killed?

01:13:56.541 --> 01:13:58.087
That was food
for those people.

01:13:58.254 --> 01:14:00.442
Now, what would happen if
someone came  into your house

01:14:00.442 --> 01:14:01.442
when you're hungry and

01:14:01.444 --> 01:14:03.746
and took the little bit of food
you had in the refrigerator

01:14:03.748 --> 01:14:05.023
and threw it down the toilet?

01:14:05.188 --> 01:14:07.547
Would you behave in
a civilized way?

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.797
Would you like people to makie money
 off your misery?

01:14:14.275 --> 01:14:16.378
We have
succeeded in establishing

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:19.003
shall we say... diplomatic relations
with the Yacumas,

01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:21.739
but, what are we for them?

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.387
These are people who have never seen
a white man before,

01:14:27.492 --> 01:14:29.170
or heard the sound of a gun.

01:14:29.274 --> 01:14:32.002
We know they are
really afraid of our powers.

01:14:32.002 --> 01:14:33.261
But for how long?

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.988
And can we really be sure
they don't hate us, like

01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:38.402
most people hate
what that don't understand.

01:14:49.415 --> 01:14:52.142
When the old members of the tribe
feel death approach

01:14:52.246 --> 01:14:55.813
they wander off to a secluded spot.

01:14:55.918 --> 01:14:58.436
After she dies this old woman--

01:15:01.269 --> 01:15:05.221
This old woman will probably end up
as lunch for some alligator.

01:15:05.695 --> 01:15:10.386
In the jungle nothing goes to waste,
nature recycles everything.

01:15:11.787 --> 01:15:13.676
You are about to witness
an ancient ritual

01:15:13.781 --> 01:15:15.668
never before
seen by civilized man.

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:18.081
The tribe is a
primitive social unit.

01:15:18.186 --> 01:15:21.018
Bound together by
the basic needs of survival.

01:15:25.843 --> 01:15:29.305
To protect itself, the tribe must eliminate
any diseased elements.

01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:30.564
Now don't go away.

01:15:30.669 --> 01:15:32.137
What your about to see

01:15:32.243 --> 01:15:35.494
...may simply be described
as social surgery.

01:16:47.082 --> 01:16:49.051
Had a long discussion last nigh
 about whether

01:16:49.054 --> 01:16:51.387
to keep going or turn back.

01:16:52.327 --> 01:16:54.311
Wasn't easy
to come to an agreement.

01:16:55.894 --> 01:16:58.831
Perhaps the others are right,
maybe we shouldn't push our luck.

01:16:59.775 --> 01:17:02.083
God knows
we've been lucky so far.

01:17:04.181 --> 01:17:06.383
But you know
what finally convinced them?

01:17:06.489 --> 01:17:08.586
The chance
to become famous.

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:11.765
To reach that spot where...
time stopped

01:17:11.768 --> 01:17:13.764
three or four
thousand years ago.

01:17:14.146 --> 01:17:19.391
Where the Yanomamos, the Tree People,
live in constant strife with their,

01:17:19.391 --> 01:17:21.818
their enemies
the Shamatares.

01:17:23.002 --> 01:17:25.468
See this guy?

01:17:25.809 --> 01:17:28.117
This was a
Yanomamo warrior,

01:17:28.117 --> 01:17:29.771
killed by the Yacumos.

01:17:30.224 --> 01:17:32.140
Just to give you an idea,

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:36.900
to the Yacumos this is a savage.

01:17:42.697 --> 01:17:45.635
I'm not speaking as a scientist
but as a man of the street.

01:17:45.635 --> 01:17:49.305
This so-called documentary
footage is offensive.

01:17:49.411 --> 01:17:53.502
It is dishonest and above all,
it is  inhuman!

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:57.801
Yes, yes, of course...
we all know what Alan was like.

01:17:57.908 --> 01:17:59.376
He overdid it
as usual.

01:17:59.376 --> 01:18:02.103
But what you saw
is a rough cut.

01:18:02.207 --> 01:18:04.166
Perhaps I haven't made
myself clear.

01:18:04.422 --> 01:18:05.822
But I...

01:18:06.151 --> 01:18:09.970
I refuse to have anything  to do
with this material.

01:18:09.970 --> 01:18:11.230
Look! Professor,

01:18:11.334 --> 01:18:14.276
we are talking about the most
sensational documentary

01:18:14.278 --> 01:18:15.642
to come along in years.

01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:19.306
...and you want us to just shelve it,
forget about it

01:18:19.411 --> 01:18:20.610
as if it had never been found?

01:18:20.670 --> 01:18:22.033
Is that what you want?

01:18:22.558 --> 01:18:24.760
Yes, yes.

01:18:25.181 --> 01:18:27.384
That is precisely what I want.

01:18:27.697 --> 01:18:30.256
I've seen the rest of the material,
you haven't.

01:18:30.744 --> 01:18:32.469
You haven't seen the stuff
that even your editors

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.206
didn't have the stomach
to put together.

01:18:34.238 --> 01:18:37.348
And if you'd had, you wouldn't hesitate
but to agree with me.

01:18:53.916 --> 01:18:55.548
John? Go ahead...

01:19:04.982 --> 01:19:07.773
We're somewhere in the middle
of this Green Inferno,

01:19:07.775 --> 01:19:10.170
where no civilized man has
ever been before.

01:19:11.691 --> 01:19:14.529
The ah,
jungle here's different.

01:19:15.826 --> 01:19:17.355
It's almost hospitable.

01:19:19.378 --> 01:19:21.905
But so far we've seen no sign yet
of these Tree People,

01:19:21.907 --> 01:19:25.053
the Yanomamos.
- Good?  Nice?

01:19:25.150 --> 01:19:26.875
We're beginning to wonder
if they really exist

01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:29.583
or if they're just a legend.

01:19:40.930 --> 01:19:41.930
Alan!

01:19:46.437 --> 01:19:47.999
I think we got one.

01:19:52.164 --> 01:19:53.943
Look what we found.

01:19:55.067 --> 01:19:57.567
Some taste you guys have,
she stinks.

01:19:58.308 --> 01:19:59.601
She's marked.
What do you guys think she is?

01:19:59.603 --> 01:20:01.269
 A Yanomamo or a Shamatare?

01:20:01.271 --> 01:20:03.246
How should I know?
Why don't you ask her?

01:20:03.445 --> 01:20:04.903
What do you want to do with her?

01:20:05.007 --> 01:20:06.986
I'll take care of the little monkey!

01:20:07.298 --> 01:20:08.548
Judging from the looks of this girl,

01:20:08.652 --> 01:20:10.839
We finally found the Yanomamos,
The Tree People.

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:12.609
We're gonna have to be
very careful,

01:20:12.818 --> 01:20:15.317
because these people
are known for their cruel--

01:20:15.991 --> 01:20:18.089
Alan, come on!

01:20:18.091 --> 01:20:21.211
Alright... alright...
I got this little monkey

01:20:22.399 --> 01:20:24.608
You go first.

01:20:25.211 --> 01:20:28.335
Oh, drop on her...Oh right.

01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:32.701
I can't help it!

01:20:33.126 --> 01:20:35.000
Oh, go ahead... alright!

01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:45.527
Open!

01:20:48.647 --> 01:20:53.010
Jack! What do you want to use it for?
A porno film?   You stupid ass!!!

01:20:53.718 --> 01:20:56.559
That's not a bad idea...
How about  <i>"Jungle Joeys"</i> ?

01:20:56.707 --> 01:20:59.207
Hey, you want me to
keep shootin'?

01:21:01.906 --> 01:21:03.843
Do you want me
to keep shooting or what?

01:21:04.093 --> 01:21:05.759
That's a stupid question.

01:21:05.863 --> 01:21:08.879
Hurry up Casanova!  It's Jack's turn...
Jack's next!

01:21:13.465 --> 01:21:14.715
Okay Jack...
go ahead.

01:21:20.131 --> 01:21:21.368
Come on.

01:21:32.853 --> 01:21:35.544
We have only three cans of film left,
we can't use this!

01:21:35.856 --> 01:21:38.756
Why do you wanna waste it like that?
- Shut up!

01:21:40.439 --> 01:21:42.082
Hey, aren't you
gonna get some Alan?

01:21:42.313 --> 01:21:45.333
The only thing he get's off on
 is his camera!

01:21:49.707 --> 01:21:52.349
Okay, Mark!
- Come on Indie!

01:21:52.435 --> 01:21:53.144
Stop shooting Mark!

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.860
Stop it Alan!!!

01:22:23.319 --> 01:22:24.815
Aaah!!

01:22:28.657 --> 01:22:30.441
God damn you!!!!

01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:37.457
He's changing reels.

01:22:47.078 --> 01:22:50.202
Alright...
move in tight, tight!

01:22:51.035 --> 01:22:52.898
Zoom in for a close up.

01:23:16.029 --> 01:23:18.020
Watch it Alan I'm shooting.

01:23:20.352 --> 01:23:21.914
Oh good Lord!

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:26.288
It's unbelievable, it's...

01:23:26.392 --> 01:23:28.058
it's horrible!

01:23:28.892 --> 01:23:32.120
I can't understand the reason
for such cruelty.

01:23:32.328 --> 01:23:36.770
Must have something to do
with some obscure sexual rite or--

01:23:37.327 --> 01:23:39.217
with the almost
profound respect

01:23:39.217 --> 01:23:41.438
these primitives
have for... for

01:23:41.525 --> 01:23:43.031
 virginity.

01:23:58.484 --> 01:24:00.249
You're rolling Mark?
- Yeah.

01:24:04.383 --> 01:24:05.633
Look up there
on the right.

01:24:07.728 --> 01:24:10.125
Wait they're
all around us!

01:24:29.377 --> 01:24:31.660
Keep rolling.
We're gonna get an Oscar for this.

01:24:52.182 --> 01:24:53.916
Jack!!!

01:24:56.571 --> 01:25:00.391
 Alan, Alan you can't!
You can't!

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:03.628
Look he's had it anyway...
- He's still alive you bastard!

01:25:03.702 --> 01:25:05.402
-You can't!  You can't!
- How much you want--

01:25:05.423 --> 01:25:07.174
Get the fuck off me!

01:25:07.713 --> 01:25:08.913
Goddamn it!

01:25:19.676 --> 01:25:21.485
Keep filming Mark,
I'll cover you.

01:25:21.589 --> 01:25:23.955
You got it!
Right down to the last foot.

01:29:06.493 --> 01:29:08.264
We really
screwed ourselves this time.

01:29:08.369 --> 01:29:10.764
trying to stay there
for the last shot.

01:29:10.868 --> 01:29:12.080
I don't even
 know where we are now.

01:29:12.082 --> 01:29:13.578
But, I know that...

01:29:14.409 --> 01:29:16.885
I know they, ah,
they followed us, and

01:29:17.567 --> 01:29:19.683
and we lost everything
trying to escape.

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.595
We're screwed!  We're trapped!

01:29:23.519 --> 01:29:25.150
I'm gonna try and
scare 'em away with this.

01:29:25.152 --> 01:29:26.265
I hope it works.

01:29:29.718 --> 01:29:31.593
Stay by me, Faye!
Don't get too far away!

01:29:31.593 --> 01:29:33.051
Stay over here!

01:29:33.155 --> 01:29:34.405
You motherfuckers!

01:29:34.696 --> 01:29:36.276
Alan!

01:29:39.377 --> 01:29:41.586
Please help me!
- Faye!!!

01:29:41.996 --> 01:29:43.251
Faye!

01:29:43.344 --> 01:29:46.485
Hey, Alan!
Ahhhh!! Help Me!  Alan!

01:29:46.902 --> 01:29:49.336
She's had it!

01:29:49.505 --> 01:29:51.159
We've gotta
think of ourselves! Hey!

01:29:51.901 --> 01:29:53.567
We've gotta take the film
back home Alan!

01:29:54.088 --> 01:29:55.129
Think of the film.

01:29:55.233 --> 01:29:56.266
Save the film.
Save the film!

01:34:04.846 --> 01:34:06.046
Burn it.

01:34:16.355 --> 01:34:17.451
John.

01:34:17.465 --> 01:34:21.380
I want this material burned.
All of it.  Yeah.

01:34:39.243 --> 01:34:42.585
I wonder who
the real cannibals are.
