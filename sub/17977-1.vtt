YOU COULD HAVE CHANGED YOUR PLAN
A LITTLE BIT?

00:38.500 --> 00:39.900
I DON'T HAVE A PLAN.

00:39.933 --> 00:41.233
THAT'S THE POINT.

01:38.733 --> 01:40.533
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND?

01:40.567 --> 01:43.067
TINA DOESN'T SEEM TO THINK
SHE REALLY IS YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

01:43.067 --> 01:45.200
I NEED TO HAVE
SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION

01:45.233 --> 01:46.367
BEFORE THE BABY IS BORN.

01:46.400 --> 01:47.800
THAT'S YOUR BABY.
