00:00.540 --> 00:04.100
Please do not try what we do on this show at home.

00:04.190 --> 00:05.700
We're what you call experts.

00:05.750 --> 00:06.670
Can't you tell?

00:09.100 --> 00:11.900
On this ship-wrecked episode of Mythbusters.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.960
Jamie and I are tend to survive on a deserted island

00:14.960 --> 00:17.600
with nothing but a pallet of duct tape.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.380
That's right, the duct tape versus wild

00:20.380 --> 00:24.420
in the most extraordinary survival challenge in history.

00:24.470 --> 00:26.990
We'll spend almost 4 day without water.

00:27.750 --> 00:28.740
It's hard.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.580
As Adam and Jamie take on mother nature

00:31.780 --> 00:34.390
using nothing but duct tape.

00:34.790 --> 00:35.870
That hurt.

00:36.430 --> 00:38.310
My stomach crows and I'm thirsty.

00:38.660 --> 00:40.480
Can they use it to collect water?

00:40.630 --> 00:42.830
Why does everything have to be so difficult?

00:42.980 --> 00:45.190
Can it stop them from starving?

00:48.720 --> 00:50.540
And will it be sink or swim

00:51.300 --> 00:53.280
in the ultimate great escape?

00:54.300 --> 00:55.610
There we go!

00:57.060 --> 00:59.250
How will this mythical material manage

00:59.430 --> 01:02.390
in this mother of all trials by tape?

01:02.840 --> 01:05.760
Can two grown men get by on a deserted island

01:05.830 --> 01:07.490
without driving each other crazy?

01:10.290 --> 01:12.020
Who are the "Mythbusters"?

01:13.120 --> 01:14.560
Adam Savage.

01:14.760 --> 01:15.830
That's disgusting.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.250
And Jamie Hyneman.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.530
It's party time.

01:18.860 --> 01:22.980
Between them, more than 30 years of special effects experience.

01:23.700 --> 01:25.500
Together with Grant Imahara.

01:25.580 --> 01:26.800
Can't wait for my car.

01:26.880 --> 01:27.630
Kari Byron,

01:27.700 --> 01:30.130
You have seen your last martini, 003.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.630
and Tory Belleci.

01:33.080 --> 01:35.010
They don't just tell the myths,

01:36.070 --> 01:38.370
they put them to the test.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.630
Pack your shades and sun hat,

01:46.680 --> 01:49.730
because it is time to be cast as castaways.

01:51.100 --> 01:52.600
What are you so happy about?

01:52.670 --> 01:54.180
I'm happy because I'm excited,

02:00.370 --> 02:01.110
What do you have in mind?

02:01.200 --> 02:04.390
I think it is time to do something truly spectacular.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.780
One, if you were stranded on a deserted island

02:06.860 --> 02:10.259
and you could choose only one material to bring with you,

02:10.460 --> 02:11.350
what would it be?

02:11.430 --> 02:12.710
- Duct tape. - Exactly.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.290
We strand ourselves on a deserted island,

02:15.340 --> 02:19.270
and all we have to survive is duct tape and duct tape alone.

02:19.270 --> 02:22.530
It certainly would be the ultimate test for duct tape.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.560
Exactly.

02:25.360 --> 02:27.290
As any castaway will tell you,

02:27.340 --> 02:30.980
staying alive on a deserted island is no mean fete.

02:31.410 --> 02:34.720
But could duct tape be the survival solution?

02:35.880 --> 02:37.250
So, what's the plan?

02:37.320 --> 02:40.540
Well, of course, first we have to be marooned, stranded.

02:41.650 --> 02:44.350
Then we have to do all the things that we need to do,

02:44.420 --> 02:46.790
like find food, water, shelter to survive,

02:46.790 --> 02:48.170
using only duct tape.

02:48.250 --> 02:51.840
Then I imagine we have to get off the island using only duct tape.

02:51.900 --> 02:52.980
Well, what are we waiting for?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.160
Let's get ship wrecked.

02:54.240 --> 02:54.850
Okay.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.830
To survive being marooned in the tropics,

02:57.900 --> 03:00.310
there are a series of life and death challenges

03:00.310 --> 03:04.560
that the "Mythbusters" like any castways simply have to overcome.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.920
The only difference for Adam and Jamie

03:06.950 --> 03:10.860
is that they have to overcome them using primarily duct tape.

03:11.300 --> 03:12.420
And to get started,

03:12.540 --> 03:14.320
there's two things they're going to need.

03:15.240 --> 03:18.550
First, a not quite deserted tropical island.

03:18.780 --> 03:19.930
And second.

03:20.090 --> 03:21.540
So, where does the duct tape come from.

03:21.540 --> 03:23.710
I don't know, maybe it washes up on the beach,

03:23.770 --> 03:25.190
like over there!

03:26.360 --> 03:30.920
Conveniently inexhaustible supply of their favorite fabric.

03:32.510 --> 03:35.150
With this much duct tape, we are set.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.420
We can build just about anything with this.

03:37.420 --> 03:38.420
Totally.

03:40.010 --> 03:44.390
The fact is, if you find yourself lost in the woods,or on a deserted island,

03:44.690 --> 03:47.870
your odds of being found diminish the longer you're gone.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.470
Therefore, one of your first

03:49.540 --> 03:52.870
and most primary tasks is to increase the ability to be detected.

03:52.870 --> 03:53.870
By a search party.

03:54.720 --> 03:58.930
Our plan is to use all these duct tape we've got to make a giant SOS signal.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.270
Hopefully somebody will see it

04:00.270 --> 04:03.040
if they're flying overhead and come rescue us.

04:03.210 --> 04:07.120
Signaling for help is certainly an urgent challenge for any strandee.

04:09.780 --> 04:11.570
The duct tape is acting like a sail.

04:11.970 --> 04:15.360
But in the tropical heat, it is also a dangerous one.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.550
It is hot and it is windy.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.170
And if you're moving around a lot

04:19.230 --> 04:21.200
trying to do stuff with no water,

04:21.730 --> 04:24.400
gets pretty uncomfortable, pretty quickly.

04:24.550 --> 04:27.040
And pretty soon it is already

04:27.040 --> 04:29.080
too uncomfortable for Adam to continue.

04:29.510 --> 04:30.620
Jamie?

04:30.700 --> 04:31.330
Yeah.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.290
This sun is killing me.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.310
I'm going to have to stop.

04:35.380 --> 04:36.770
'Cause otherwise I'm going to fry.

04:36.810 --> 04:37.410
Okay.

04:37.860 --> 04:41.760
The sun and I, we always had an agreement to disagree.

04:41.830 --> 04:44.080
I don't like him and he doesn't like me.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.540
So if I'm going to get any substantive work done,

04:46.960 --> 04:48.820
I am going to have to protect my head

04:49.440 --> 04:52.130
so that I can see and not get sun burned.

04:52.430 --> 04:54.010
This wind is brutal.

04:55.750 --> 04:57.800
It is a crucial change of course.

04:58.460 --> 05:00.920
Sun exposure is actually something to be avoided.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.340
Not only can you be raised burn skin,

05:03.400 --> 05:05.830
because it's even mild exposure can cause dizziness,

05:05.860 --> 05:07.410
nausea, and fever.

05:07.620 --> 05:11.030
All which could compromise our desert island survival.

05:11.470 --> 05:13.870
Which is why Adam's sticky stetson...

05:14.770 --> 05:16.220
This is great.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.430
is a tangent worth taking.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.680
All right, let's get back to work.

05:23.330 --> 05:24.320
I'm back.

05:24.330 --> 05:25.630
Nice hat.

05:25.700 --> 05:26.510
Thank you.

05:27.220 --> 05:28.730
With a reinvigorated Adam.

05:28.790 --> 05:30.140
Now we're talking.

05:30.480 --> 05:34.020
It is not long before their giant sign looms large.

05:34.980 --> 05:37.550
Our SOS signal is nice and large.

05:37.620 --> 05:41.390
And most importantly, it doesn't look like it belongs here.

05:41.450 --> 05:42.350
It is unnatural,

05:42.410 --> 05:46.060
which is what you want to catch somebody's eye from a plane overhead.

05:46.260 --> 05:48.590
The only bad thing about duct tape is that

05:48.650 --> 05:51.960
while it is slightly reflective, it is gray.

05:52.010 --> 05:55.020
It's not the most optimal thing to catch somebody's eye.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.130
But we're using what we have,

05:57.190 --> 05:58.130
so it will have to do.

05:58.570 --> 06:00.890
Covering 900 square feet

06:00.890 --> 06:03.120
and visible from 4 miles up,

06:03.250 --> 06:08.200
the giant duct tape SOS is a good start for our canny castaways.

06:08.260 --> 06:12.580
But task two is something that's much more do or die.

06:13.070 --> 06:16.470
The next thing that is at the very top of our list is water.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.840
We need fresh water and we need it soon.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.010
Ow, sand's hot.

06:21.160 --> 06:24.310
That means we got to make it or find it.

06:24.710 --> 06:25.600
One way or another,

06:25.650 --> 06:27.810
we've got to be able to move around well to do that.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.470
That means that we need shoes.

06:31.530 --> 06:32.420
Here's the thing,

06:32.430 --> 06:34.660
this ground is really not very friendly.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.100
If I were to puncture my feet,

06:36.160 --> 06:38.610
I could get infection and I could get a parasite

06:38.660 --> 06:40.660
that could put me way out of commission

06:40.670 --> 06:42.670
and compromise my survival significantly.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.260
Despite being tremendously thirsty,

06:45.370 --> 06:48.560
making shoes is another safety-first approach.

06:49.270 --> 06:50.730
That looks like a good spot.

06:50.730 --> 06:53.740
After all, going lame before finding water

06:53.740 --> 06:55.740
would be very bad news indeed.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.350
Long time ago,

06:57.440 --> 07:00.750
people discovered leather was a great thing to make shoes out of.

07:00.830 --> 07:02.750
I'm going for a Roman sandal type thing.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.060
Me, too.

07:04.310 --> 07:06.430
As it happens, not long ago,

07:06.490 --> 07:08.420
we made a duct tape boat and

07:08.420 --> 07:10.170
found when we worked with it,

07:10.200 --> 07:12.580
it was very very similar to leather.

07:12.700 --> 07:16.140
That means that duct tape

07:16.260 --> 07:19.140
is actually a perfect material to make shoes out of.

07:19.490 --> 07:21.560
I am getting cautiously optimistic about these.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.180
Despite the tremendous tropical heat,

07:24.230 --> 07:26.770
the guys cover their way through rips,

07:28.570 --> 07:29.260
twists--

07:29.600 --> 07:31.130
Look at that, instant rope.

07:31.310 --> 07:32.540
--and turns.

07:32.590 --> 07:33.660
Dude, check it out.

07:33.840 --> 07:34.870
Those look great.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.410
Until both sets of shoes are all set.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.370
My shoes are completed.

07:41.390 --> 07:42.890
They're light, they're comfy.

07:42.890 --> 07:44.950
I'm not sure exactly how well they're gonna hold up.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.260
But the best part about are being made of duct tape, is that it doesn't matter,

07:48.290 --> 07:50.150
they're infinitely repairable.

07:50.210 --> 07:51.200
There we go.

07:51.410 --> 07:52.510
Those are great.

07:52.580 --> 07:53.490
- You know what I am? - What?

07:54.180 --> 07:55.690
I am fricking thirsty.

07:55.950 --> 07:57.910
Let's go get some water.

07:57.910 --> 07:58.910
All right.

07:59.590 --> 08:01.010
With their footwear finished,

08:01.040 --> 08:04.240
the guys can finally begin the hunt for some H2O.

08:04.820 --> 08:06.340
Water is essential to life.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.690
A person can go for about three weeks without food,

08:09.750 --> 08:13.460
but can go only about three days without water.

08:13.820 --> 08:16.080
Water is our number one priority.

08:16.970 --> 08:18.720
There's got to be water around here somewhere.

08:18.720 --> 08:19.970
I really hope so.

08:21.630 --> 08:23.850
It's been hours since their last drink,

08:24.750 --> 08:27.050
and staying positive ain't easy.

08:28.010 --> 08:31.090
Not only am I thirsty, I'm cranky.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.320
But with dusk not far away,

08:33.360 --> 08:35.630
Adam at last thinks he struck gold.

08:35.970 --> 08:38.039
Oh, thank God.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.030
Hold on there, cowboy.

08:39.330 --> 08:40.400
I wouldn't touch that.

08:40.450 --> 08:41.159
Why?

08:41.289 --> 08:42.610
This is stagnant water.

08:42.750 --> 08:43.760
You'll get sick.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.500
With how thirsty I am, we can't drink any of this?

08:46.610 --> 08:47.940
No, we got to do it right.

08:48.050 --> 08:48.910
Crap.

08:50.050 --> 08:51.130
Look, when it comes to water,

08:51.170 --> 08:52.920
there are certain things you can't do.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.710
You can't drink saltwater, drink your own urine,

08:55.740 --> 08:58.060
you can't drink murky, still,

08:58.060 --> 08:59.230
stagnant water.

08:59.420 --> 09:01.020
If you do any of those things,

09:01.080 --> 09:03.890
you'll and up with losing more water than you'll gain.

09:04.130 --> 09:05.390
That's all there is to it.

09:05.520 --> 09:06.480
Jamie is right.

09:06.570 --> 09:10.100
The smell alone says that this water is not for drinking.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.380
And that's not the only bad news.

09:12.470 --> 09:13.930
Dude, it's getting dark.

09:14.350 --> 09:15.500
Yeah.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.910
I think we need to stop trying to find water

09:17.950 --> 09:19.520
and find a place to sleep instead.

09:19.580 --> 09:20.110
Okay.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.670
It is the survivor's worst case scenario.

09:22.680 --> 09:23.640
With daylight fading,

09:23.650 --> 09:26.560
the guys have to abandon the search for water

09:26.660 --> 09:29.020
and instead, make an emergency camp.

09:29.330 --> 09:30.890
Let's just make some mats

09:30.950 --> 09:32.890
so we don't have to lay on the bare ground.

09:34.370 --> 09:35.650
With no time to waste,

09:35.710 --> 09:38.750
their only option is to literally tape a duct tape sheet

09:38.810 --> 09:39.860
straight to the ground.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.310
With any luck, the bugs will get stuck on the adhesive

09:43.310 --> 09:45.660
instead of crowling on you.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.700
It's not a good wrap for a not very good day.

09:51.410 --> 09:53.200
There it is when I've been proud of the work

09:53.200 --> 09:54.990
we have done on the show.

09:55.410 --> 09:57.190
Escaping an underwater car.

09:57.190 --> 09:58.260
I survived.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.420
Firing the world's first hail rocket.

10:05.390 --> 10:07.530
Today is not one of those days.

10:07.730 --> 10:08.930
We built some stuff,

10:08.990 --> 10:10.870
but we did not succeed getting food

10:10.880 --> 10:12.760
and definitely not succeed getting water.

10:12.790 --> 10:14.440
Consequently I am both thirsty,

10:14.980 --> 10:17.530
famished, uncomfortable, and really tired.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.460
Honestly. I am a little daunted about what tomorrow holds.

10:22.600 --> 10:23.470
Still to come.

10:23.560 --> 10:24.670
On November 14th,

10:24.720 --> 10:26.550
Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman were removed

10:26.550 --> 10:30.120
from civilization with only their wits duct tape to survive.

10:38.850 --> 10:40.750
You know there's an awful lot of footprints

10:40.750 --> 10:43.470
on this beach for it being a deserted island at all.

10:43.470 --> 10:44.760
Let's not think about it.

10:44.830 --> 10:45.890
It could drive yourself crazy.

10:46.650 --> 10:48.630
The mythbusters started their

10:48.630 --> 10:50.610
duct tape survival special with high hopes.

10:51.130 --> 10:53.400
We are stranded on a deserted island with nothing

10:53.430 --> 10:54.980
but several miles of duct tape.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.390
I am feeling pretty optimistic

10:57.420 --> 10:58.660
about our chance of survival.

10:59.030 --> 11:01.690
Although day one didn't go according to plan.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.720
I can't drink any of this?

11:05.460 --> 11:07.370
They're beginning day two

11:07.380 --> 11:08.920
by trying to stay upbeat.

11:09.300 --> 11:10.750
Might as well take this with us.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.990
Oh, that's nasty.

11:17.570 --> 11:21.810
Well, I suppose we could take the two of these we made,

11:21.880 --> 11:23.920
put them together, we would have a nice mattress.

11:25.060 --> 11:28.280
There's no doubt that they are in a sticky situation,

11:28.510 --> 11:30.080
but with shoes refitted.

11:30.150 --> 11:32.100
Not pretty but they get the job done.

11:32.530 --> 11:37.060
Adam grabs some duct tape and sets out to try to find drinkable water.

11:38.470 --> 11:39.610
Good walking stick.

11:39.740 --> 11:43.530
This time he is heading in the opposite direction to yesterday's route.

11:45.260 --> 11:47.810
Clearly these plants are getting water from somewhere.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.260
I just need to find it.

11:49.260 --> 11:51.600
By following the lusher vegetation,

11:51.780 --> 11:54.810
he hopes to increase his chances of finding a water source.

11:55.030 --> 11:57.200
But it is still no walk in the park.

11:57.380 --> 11:58.790
I have been walking around for a while.

11:59.770 --> 12:01.170
And I still haven't found any water.

12:01.210 --> 12:03.690
What we have here is a classic Catch-22.

12:04.870 --> 12:05.870
I need water

12:06.500 --> 12:08.070
and I'm burning through a lot of it

12:08.170 --> 12:09.980
just to try to find water.

12:10.250 --> 12:13.230
If I don't find it soon, it's going to be bad.

12:13.850 --> 12:15.680
So let's hope Jamie can do better.

12:16.390 --> 12:18.810
It's hot out here and I'm thirsty.

12:18.890 --> 12:22.000
I got water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.

12:22.670 --> 12:27.640
Except I can make fresh water out of this saltwater

12:28.210 --> 12:30.660
with the sun's help and some duct tape.

12:30.970 --> 12:33.860
It may sound as though Jamie has been in the sun too long--

12:34.130 --> 12:35.720
It's already getting moist.

12:36.030 --> 12:38.620
But his fresh water from saltwater idea

12:38.750 --> 12:40.450
is rooted in reality.

12:41.870 --> 12:42.910
I found water.

12:43.170 --> 12:46.420
He is going to build a device called a solar still,

12:46.960 --> 12:49.300
which is considerably more complicated

12:49.380 --> 12:52.190
than finding salty water in a sandy hole.

12:52.830 --> 12:55.070
A solar still uses the sun's rays

12:55.070 --> 12:57.360
and condensation to collect water.

12:57.790 --> 12:58.780
Here is how.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.830
The hole I've dug is deep enough that it is wet with saltwater.

13:01.920 --> 13:02.660
At the bottom,

13:02.730 --> 13:05.390
I'll place a collection cup made from duct tape.

13:05.690 --> 13:08.800
Above the hole, I'll put clear plastic sheeting.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.860
The hot sun shines through,

13:10.900 --> 13:12.630
evaporates it from the sand

13:12.630 --> 13:14.090
leaving the salt behind.

13:14.510 --> 13:18.110
The water vapor than condenses on the cool inside of plastic surface,

13:18.180 --> 13:21.570
and drips down into the cup as pure, drinkable water.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.060
That's the theory, at least.

13:23.060 --> 13:24.510
Let's see how well it works.

13:24.890 --> 13:28.870
Having made his well and taped up a collection cup.

13:29.580 --> 13:31.990
There it is, guarantee it is waterproof.

13:32.380 --> 13:35.170
All that's missing is a clear plastic overshoot.

13:35.180 --> 13:39.240
For that, Jamie is bending the duct tape rules.

13:39.980 --> 13:43.010
I'm making a duct tape spider web as a framework

13:43.240 --> 13:47.080
for which to hold together this stuff, shrink wrap.

13:47.440 --> 13:49.270
I know that you're saying it is not duct tape.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.230
Why are we using it.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.990
It did come on the duct tape pallet.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.090
I don't know what I'm going to use this stuff for,

13:55.160 --> 13:58.640
but I bet you it's going to come in real handy.

13:59.090 --> 14:00.960
You know, it is survival.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.250
We have to use everything at our disposal.

14:03.390 --> 14:07.010
The thing is that all these little pieces don't really help us so much.

14:07.030 --> 14:10.710
But once they're held together in one big sheet, we're golden.

14:10.870 --> 14:11.840
There we go.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.730
Hopefully I didn't use more water

14:13.730 --> 14:15.490
making it than it will make for me.

14:16.980 --> 14:20.490
The last step is to carefully position the sheet over the hole.

14:20.950 --> 14:22.760
Here we go. That's the ticket.

14:23.050 --> 14:26.360
And almost immediately, there are encouraging signs.

14:27.010 --> 14:28.990
All of that fog you can already see

14:29.050 --> 14:31.760
forming on the underside of the plastic is what this is about.

14:32.170 --> 14:34.500
It is picking up moisture from damp sand,

14:34.600 --> 14:36.690
which is evaporating, collecting on plastic.

14:36.730 --> 14:39.510
Eventually, those will form larger and larger droplets

14:39.540 --> 14:42.580
which will run downhill into my collection container.

14:43.020 --> 14:44.040
Now we just have to wait.

14:46.290 --> 14:47.750
It is the moment of truth.

14:47.940 --> 14:49.950
Two hours cooking in the midday sun.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.290
What's the verdict?

14:51.500 --> 14:54.010
Well, there it is.

14:54.250 --> 14:55.740
That's pure water.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.850
But that's like a quarter of a cup.

14:58.860 --> 15:02.720
With less than 5% of their daily watery needs,

15:02.760 --> 15:04.430
it is a disappointing result.

15:04.430 --> 15:06.760
Why does everything have to be so difficult?

15:07.570 --> 15:09.680
But back at the rumble in the jungle,

15:09.760 --> 15:12.210
Adam is welling up with excitement.

15:16.050 --> 15:17.060
It is fresh!

15:17.390 --> 15:18.350
All right, water bottles.

15:18.650 --> 15:21.310
Half my task is down. I've found fresh water.

15:21.310 --> 15:22.510
No small feat.

15:22.570 --> 15:24.370
That's really important for our survival.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.310
Now I simply have to get it back.

15:28.110 --> 15:29.870
So I'm going to build something to carry the water.

15:30.270 --> 15:31.740
But in the middle of the bush--

15:34.320 --> 15:35.880
Beeping mosquitos.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.370
that's something not as easy as it sounds.

15:39.870 --> 15:41.980
I would kill for a workbench right about now.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.470
Adam's making a kind of tubular bottles

15:44.710 --> 15:46.850
which should hold about ten pints of water,

15:47.160 --> 15:49.280
provided of course that it doesn't leak.

15:49.540 --> 15:51.640
If I get a single wrinkle in this thing,

15:52.010 --> 15:53.680
it is a place water can get out.

15:54.110 --> 15:54.970
Can't have that.

15:55.340 --> 15:57.080
Water has got to go from the pond

15:57.090 --> 15:59.200
into here into here.

15:59.410 --> 16:01.610
It is a painstaking operation.

16:01.670 --> 16:04.410
But eventually, there's only one thing left to do.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.240
Oh, oh, it is cold.

16:07.240 --> 16:08.180
Fill it up.

16:09.430 --> 16:11.060
Fill up, baby. Come on.

16:11.850 --> 16:12.800
Please hold up.

16:13.210 --> 16:14.690
First impressions are good.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.430
It's working!

16:19.420 --> 16:22.200
And second impressions are even better.

16:22.540 --> 16:23.720
Seems to be holding.

16:27.650 --> 16:28.500
Awesome!

16:28.590 --> 16:29.990
I better get back to Jamie.

16:30.020 --> 16:31.070
I bet he's thirsty.

16:32.160 --> 16:35.220
It is the most crucial survival challenge overcome,

16:35.460 --> 16:38.270
thanks incrediblly to duct tape shoes and duct tape water vessel,

16:39.920 --> 16:42.410
Adam source that never ending water supply.

16:42.680 --> 16:45.260
That means things are finally looking up.

16:45.660 --> 16:47.500
Because for the time being, at least,

16:47.660 --> 16:50.130
the myth busters aren't going to drop dead.

16:50.830 --> 16:52.380
How did the solar still work?

16:52.510 --> 16:53.380
It worked.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.470
But I only got about half a cup.

16:55.530 --> 16:57.670
I have some good news.

16:58.750 --> 17:00.470
How about six liters' worth.

17:00.610 --> 17:01.510
That's fantastic.

17:01.720 --> 17:02.940
The hunt was worth it.

17:03.520 --> 17:04.540
Look at that.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.460
Cheers!

17:08.839 --> 17:09.819
Oh, that's good.

17:10.609 --> 17:12.099
You know what I am ready for now?

17:12.460 --> 17:14.319
A nice, fat, juicy steak.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.250
- Time for food?  - Yeah.

17:16.250 --> 17:17.950
Let's do it.

17:18.220 --> 17:20.819
Next, will dinner be served?

17:20.859 --> 17:22.800
Chasing a chiken,

17:22.800 --> 17:24.400
which is not a euphemism.

17:24.490 --> 17:25.760
This is harder than I thought.

17:32.230 --> 17:33.280
Without doubt,

17:33.480 --> 17:38.070
tropical islands can be the very epitome of paradise on earth.

17:39.380 --> 17:40.950
Yet for the "Mythbusters,"

17:41.690 --> 17:44.490
it's been more a case of paradise lost.

17:46.140 --> 17:48.390
But having finally quenched their thirst.

17:48.390 --> 17:49.430
Cheers.

17:49.430 --> 17:52.090
Their duct tape survival is improving.

17:52.620 --> 17:54.610
Now that we've got fresh water,

17:55.110 --> 17:57.010
it's time to figure out how to get food.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.980
Adam is going to tackle the land,

18:00.030 --> 18:01.550
and I'm going to tackle the sea.

18:02.410 --> 18:04.070
With the hunger clock ticking,

18:04.110 --> 18:06.450
Jamie decides there's only one solution.

18:06.980 --> 18:07.970
Spear fishing.

18:08.150 --> 18:09.000
There we go.

18:09.610 --> 18:12.860
And while mother nature does provide the main component.

18:12.950 --> 18:14.060
Give it up, tree,

18:14.260 --> 18:15.330
You're going to lose.

18:16.070 --> 18:18.380
Duct tape is an integral part.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.920
Might be able to do something with that.

18:21.730 --> 18:23.300
There're three things that I can do to help

18:23.300 --> 18:24.870
with duct tape to help make a spear.

18:25.490 --> 18:29.720
First it will allow me to attach and easily replace multiple points on the tip.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.240
Perfect.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.450
I dare say any little fish or critter

18:33.450 --> 18:35.590
wouldn't really want to get stuck by that.

18:37.250 --> 18:40.110
Then I can also use it to mark the balance point of the shaft

18:40.160 --> 18:41.620
which will help with accuracy.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.710
There we go.

18:43.850 --> 18:46.060
And finally, the line on the end

18:46.120 --> 18:47.780
helps me retrieve it once I have thrown it.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.500
I'm going to go catch me some fish!

18:53.310 --> 18:54.850
Meanwhile, in the forest,

18:54.920 --> 18:57.050
Adam is on a wild chicken run,

18:57.050 --> 18:57.970
Literally.

19:01.340 --> 19:04.620
I'm really hungry, and I saw some chickens out here.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.910
Wild chickens are good eating.

19:09.270 --> 19:10.370
It flies?

19:11.220 --> 19:13.130
Nobody told me that chickens could fly.

19:16.730 --> 19:20.320
Clearly chasing them is a low percentage game.

19:20.490 --> 19:22.010
I'm gonna need to outsmart them,

19:22.680 --> 19:23.990
and make some kind of trap.

19:24.070 --> 19:27.190
I'm thinking --a snare

19:28.030 --> 19:30.690
Usually consisting of an anchored wire noose,

19:30.870 --> 19:33.950
snare traps are one of the simplest of all hunting tools.

19:35.080 --> 19:38.400
But can one made of woven duct tape really work?

19:39.580 --> 19:41.550
I've got to study that baton twirling.

19:43.020 --> 19:44.810
Now the whole idea of snare,

19:44.810 --> 19:47.580
is taht this loop sits unassumingly on the ground

19:47.660 --> 19:50.430
until a chicken walks by, I yank it,

19:51.200 --> 19:52.950
and hopefully I catch the chicken by the leg.

19:54.700 --> 19:55.820
Now it is a waiting game.

19:56.670 --> 19:57.880
And while Adam waits,

19:57.880 --> 19:59.750
let's cut to the chase with Jamie.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.790
What I've got to do is pretty straightforward.

20:04.580 --> 20:06.430
Spot a fish and spear it.

20:06.840 --> 20:10.670
Like snaring a chicken, it sounds easy in theory.

20:10.810 --> 20:14.320
Okay, fish, hold still.

20:16.130 --> 20:19.610
But in practice, it's a bitch.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.900
I'm not leaving here without dinner.

20:22.300 --> 20:23.380
On the plus side go,

20:23.980 --> 20:25.910
the duct tape spear is holding up well.

20:25.930 --> 20:29.170
I like my wired string, work like tree.

20:30.420 --> 20:32.410
Now if I can get just the fish to hold still.

20:33.830 --> 20:35.690
Just like fishing with a rod and real,

20:35.980 --> 20:38.430
spear fishing is about patience.

20:38.630 --> 20:41.060
It is not like they're going to sit there like ducks

20:41.160 --> 20:42.790
and wait for you to spear them.

20:43.170 --> 20:44.940
You have got to just hang it out,

20:44.960 --> 20:48.050
wait for the right time, and then throw.

20:48.510 --> 20:50.630
And there's no time like the present.

20:51.490 --> 20:54.660
Yeah!

20:55.490 --> 20:56.660
About time.

20:56.790 --> 20:58.770
At last, he nailed it.

20:59.310 --> 21:01.000
Oh, yeah, baby.

21:01.780 --> 21:03.140
Sushi for dinner.

21:03.140 --> 21:04.690
It's a great result.

21:04.690 --> 21:07.090
Sorry, little buddy, it's for a good cause.

21:07.420 --> 21:08.520
Yeah, I know.

21:08.690 --> 21:10.330
Especially because in the jungle,

21:10.330 --> 21:13.460
Adam's snare affair is a dud.

21:13.970 --> 21:14.990
Damn!

21:14.990 --> 21:16.650
Consequently, he has been busy

21:16.650 --> 21:18.970
taping up plan c.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.410
I have been unable to coax a bird into my snare.

21:22.410 --> 21:23.810
I've changed direction.

21:23.810 --> 21:26.110
And I am not actually building a duct tape spider web here,

21:26.110 --> 21:27.220
I'm building a net,

21:27.220 --> 21:28.790
that a layer cross the forest floor.

21:28.790 --> 21:30.650
When a chicken walks across it,

21:30.650 --> 21:34.300
I'll snatch it up kind of like the Ewoks from the Star Wars.

21:34.650 --> 21:35.260
Why?

21:35.460 --> 21:37.700
Because if anyone knows about hunting in forest,

21:37.700 --> 21:39.760
it's the Ewoks.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.150
Getting close.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.170
Now it's time to conceal it.

21:43.170 --> 21:45.990
So surely this is a homerun.

21:45.990 --> 21:48.130
The net is concealed on the forest floor here.

21:48.130 --> 21:49.930
I'm hoping to chase chicken through

21:50.260 --> 21:51.690
from this direction.

21:51.960 --> 21:54.600
I can be as far back as 15 feet behind him,

21:54.700 --> 21:57.050
and I got this lean on this line,

21:57.210 --> 21:59.080
and all the sidelines go up,

21:59.080 --> 22:01.560
along with the net, along with the chicken.

22:01.970 --> 22:03.090
And that's dinner.

22:04.110 --> 22:07.500
Moments later, Adam carefully crows out some passing poultry

22:07.500 --> 22:09.850
into the danger zone.

22:09.970 --> 22:11.110
Until --

22:13.180 --> 22:15.310
Oh, no.

22:16.940 --> 22:18.220
He got away!

22:18.930 --> 22:21.090
He squirmed right out the side.

22:21.670 --> 22:24.150
The force is strong with this one.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.730
There he is, taunting me.

22:27.620 --> 22:28.380
He's taunting me.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.760
It's like "In your face, Mythbuster".

22:31.120 --> 22:32.840
But a quick reset later,

22:32.840 --> 22:35.330
and Adam is soon on the prowl once more.

22:42.420 --> 22:43.110
I got it!

22:43.110 --> 22:43.770
I got the chicken!

22:46.690 --> 22:48.730
Look, look!

22:49.030 --> 22:52.190
My net caught the chicken!

22:54.680 --> 22:55.990
How're you doing there, buddy?

22:59.280 --> 23:00.890
We're going to eat good tonight.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.350
Ain't that the truth?

23:02.350 --> 23:04.740
With two food groups captured in one day,

23:04.740 --> 23:07.340
it's another tick for the chanllenge tape.

23:07.340 --> 23:10.490
But before moving to the next survival challenge,

23:10.490 --> 23:12.770
here is a quick word from our sponsor.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.220
For those of you playing at home,

23:15.220 --> 23:16.220
I just want to be clear,

23:16.220 --> 23:18.240
that this is in fact a wild chicken in Hawaii.

23:18.240 --> 23:21.280
We did chase it and we did catch it in my net.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.220
We're not, however, going to kill it, cook it and eat it.

23:24.220 --> 23:26.480
The chicken you see us eat later in the episode

23:26.630 --> 23:27.810
was store bought.

23:27.810 --> 23:28.840
Next, on Mythbusters

23:28.840 --> 23:30.010
Who's made it homy?

23:30.010 --> 23:32.700
Adam and Jamie sharpened up their shelter.

23:32.700 --> 23:34.430
By the way, what's with the chicken?

23:34.430 --> 23:36.510
Well, that's Wilson.

23:36.510 --> 23:37.850
He's my new friend.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.530
Please don't try what you're about to see at home.

23:43.710 --> 23:45.970
We're what you call experts.

23:46.070 --> 23:47.610
Yeah.

23:51.990 --> 23:55.300
Food has featured in many an episode of "Mythbusters."

23:57.630 --> 24:00.080
That's so wrong.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.960
But rarely is it ever actually eaten.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.060
Tenderizing steak with explosives.

24:07.790 --> 24:11.490
But on day three of this duct tape survival special,

24:11.490 --> 24:12.360
I got the chicken!

24:13.300 --> 24:15.410
Food is finally on the menu.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.730
Sushi for dinner.

24:17.930 --> 24:21.750
Provided, of course, the "Mythbusters" can cook up.

24:22.380 --> 24:24.550
It's time to do the most primordial of human inventions.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.720
It's time to build the fire.

24:27.370 --> 24:28.670
How is this gonna work?

24:29.040 --> 24:30.170
Jesus crow.

24:30.170 --> 24:31.150
Come on.

24:31.570 --> 24:33.020
It's gonna work by friction,

24:33.020 --> 24:34.430
specifically the friction between this piece of wood

24:34.430 --> 24:35.960
and the base piece of wood,

24:35.960 --> 24:39.270
created by what's called a friction bow.

24:39.610 --> 24:43.010
I have a duct tape string streched on a piece of bamboo.

24:43.010 --> 24:45.270
I will roll it back and forth,

24:45.270 --> 24:48.380
which cause the stick to spin very rapidly,

24:48.380 --> 24:50.250
hopefully creating enough friction to creat an ember

24:50.250 --> 24:52.120
which will be the germ of my fire.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.660
The so called bore-drill

24:53.660 --> 24:57.070
is one of the most traditional ways to start a flame.

24:57.990 --> 24:59.520
I don't want to get optimistic yet.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.310
It's also one of the hardest.

25:05.990 --> 25:08.280
No, no, no, no.

25:12.450 --> 25:16.310
But Adam tries, tries, and tries again.

25:16.310 --> 25:20.130
Until at last his duct tape bow goes ballistic.

25:24.010 --> 25:25.370
I got it, Jamie!

25:25.580 --> 25:26.660
I got it!

25:28.170 --> 25:29.580
It took freaking forever.

25:29.580 --> 25:31.920
And once the fire really takes hold,

25:32.610 --> 25:34.010
Now we're cooking.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.980
it's not long before dinner is served.

25:37.990 --> 25:39.940
Not bad living here on the deserted island.

25:41.020 --> 25:42.530
Nothing beats home cooking.

25:42.540 --> 25:43.550
Nope.

25:45.490 --> 25:47.570
With food and fire now sorted,

25:47.570 --> 25:51.000
the real life and death hurdles have been cleared comfortably.

25:51.040 --> 25:54.860
But there's a lot more to taming an island paradise than that.

25:55.370 --> 25:58.400
And next, it is time to better their abode.

25:59.510 --> 26:01.040
So with a new day dawned,

26:01.040 --> 26:04.030
Adam is searching for some respectable real estate.

26:04.090 --> 26:06.630
And will this do?

26:09.060 --> 26:10.190
Look at that!

26:10.810 --> 26:12.210
It's beautiful!

26:13.580 --> 26:14.790
Looks like a cathedral.

26:14.790 --> 26:19.060
This is the perfect place for us to set up a more permanent camp.

26:21.100 --> 26:22.180
I love it!

26:23.110 --> 26:24.920
One of the reasons this place is perfect

26:24.930 --> 26:26.860
is that I can string a couple of hammocks.

26:28.100 --> 26:28.890
Hammocks are great.

26:28.890 --> 26:30.370
Not just 'cause they're comfy.

26:31.510 --> 26:33.100
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

26:35.180 --> 26:36.560
In an unfamiliar place,

26:36.560 --> 26:38.400
you don't really want to sleep on the ground.

26:38.840 --> 26:41.600
You don't want to give yourself such easy access to things like,

26:41.930 --> 26:44.240
I don't know, centipedes,

26:44.800 --> 26:47.890
scorpions and other things I don't want to think about.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.940
Adam, how come you used up

26:50.940 --> 26:54.130
all our good duct tape ropes on those hammocks.

26:54.690 --> 26:58.690
Jamie, staying on a deserted island for weeks,

26:59.340 --> 27:01.190
I want to be comfortable when I sleep.

27:02.300 --> 27:04.010
I don't really care how I sleep.

27:04.010 --> 27:06.140
I could sleep on a pile of rocks and millipedes.

27:06.140 --> 27:07.720
I wouldn't care.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.920
Alright, here goes enough.

27:11.000 --> 27:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

27:20.700 --> 27:22.390
This is seriously comfortable.

27:22.640 --> 27:25.400
Like I'm not even kidding for television comfortable.

27:27.630 --> 27:30.800
As home renovations go, it's a solid start.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.830
But there's much more to this castaway crave

27:32.830 --> 27:34.850
than good hang time.

27:36.350 --> 27:37.730
Oh, hello!

27:38.100 --> 27:39.290
I'm so glad you stopped by.

27:39.290 --> 27:41.050
Welcome to banion estates.

27:41.050 --> 27:42.640
Can I give you the grand tour?

27:42.770 --> 27:46.050
This is the buster's accommodations with the master bed,

27:46.500 --> 27:48.750
shelter and rain capture all in one,

27:48.750 --> 27:51.870
with a nice foot mat, so one can get in and out of bed

27:52.010 --> 27:53.700
without having to wear shoes.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.900
The guest accommodations are almost as nice

27:55.900 --> 27:59.440
with guest rain catcher and roof along with extra rope

27:59.440 --> 28:02.210
for anything that needs rope.

28:02.530 --> 28:04.460
It is all the comforts of home

28:04.480 --> 28:06.180
on your own deserted island.

28:07.260 --> 28:09.100
And if that weren't enough.

28:09.640 --> 28:11.220
I can't tell you how good it is to sit

28:11.460 --> 28:12.820
after all this time.

28:12.820 --> 28:15.060
Adam goes the extra "Mythbusters" mile

28:15.200 --> 28:17.240
by building up table and chairs.

28:17.580 --> 28:18.450
Now, for the pieces.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.030
And a chess set,

28:20.230 --> 28:24.240
which should give their duct tape camp that little bit of luxury.

28:29.820 --> 28:33.050
Meanwhile, Jamie's been taking an experimental tangent.

28:34.090 --> 28:35.420
These waves make me wonder,

28:36.190 --> 28:37.580
Maybe I can make a surfboard

28:37.980 --> 28:39.140
out of duct tape.

28:40.860 --> 28:43.420
Yep, with hunger and thirst no longer an issue,

28:43.620 --> 28:45.640
Jamie's decided to get gnarly.

28:47.390 --> 28:50.120
The surf boards came together pretty much the way that I had planned.

28:50.120 --> 28:53.380
It has four pontoons that are all taped together into one big thing

28:53.380 --> 28:56.250
that is the size and shape of a surfboard, more or less, and,

28:56.250 --> 28:59.000
I imagine it will work like one.

28:59.760 --> 29:00.830
Time to go surfing.

29:02.930 --> 29:04.200
Despite the optimism,

29:04.440 --> 29:06.360
there's a major drawback.

29:07.020 --> 29:08.060
Look at that.

29:08.970 --> 29:11.230
Jamie's never surfed in his life.

29:15.640 --> 29:19.540
And learning on a slightly leaky duct tape surfboard

29:20.150 --> 29:22.110
was never going to be plain sailing.

29:29.780 --> 29:30.950
Here we go!

29:32.150 --> 29:33.200
Well, that was exhausting,

29:34.350 --> 29:37.110
but I'm actually kind of happy with it,

29:37.530 --> 29:42.160
because I learned that while duct tape is okay at sealing things up,

29:42.160 --> 29:43.310
it is not perfect.

29:43.310 --> 29:44.730
It eventually stops in leaks.

29:49.450 --> 29:52.930
So if you built something that's relying on a sealed pontoon,

29:53.930 --> 29:54.790
then you're screwed,

29:54.790 --> 29:58.550
because you got no ability to bail it and empty it out anyway,

29:58.560 --> 30:00.240
and it's gonna sink.

30:00.650 --> 30:04.220
So failure as a surfboard, yes.

30:04.310 --> 30:06.570
But success as an experiment.

30:07.150 --> 30:08.980
And that's not the only success.

30:08.980 --> 30:10.640
Because physical exercise,

30:12.920 --> 30:14.640
along with mental stimulation

30:14.650 --> 30:17.160
I don't think we ever actually played a game of chess together before.

30:17.670 --> 30:21.690
are two very important goals for any survivalist.

30:21.890 --> 30:23.270
There's a bug on my bishop.

30:25.110 --> 30:26.970
It is actually a proven fact

30:27.250 --> 30:28.420
that keeping yourself mentally acute

30:28.420 --> 30:29.870
with something like a game of chess

30:29.970 --> 30:32.240
makes you better at problem solving.

30:32.360 --> 30:34.200
And surviving in a situation like this

30:34.400 --> 30:36.280
is all about problem solving.

30:36.560 --> 30:37.560
Checkmate.

30:37.660 --> 30:39.070
- Nicely done. - Thank you.

30:39.870 --> 30:43.320
Which means another key target in the survival challenge

30:43.420 --> 30:44.530
has been met.

30:44.860 --> 30:46.220
And that leaves only one thing.

30:47.970 --> 30:48.680
Escape.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.330
Although Adam and Jamie's island survival

30:59.530 --> 31:01.190
has not gone quite this well.

31:03.550 --> 31:04.540
This is going to be a fish.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.430
It has been a resounding success,

31:08.170 --> 31:11.400
because after four days as duct tape castaways,

31:11.610 --> 31:12.960
they're physically fresh,

31:16.730 --> 31:17.900
mentally focused,

31:17.900 --> 31:19.240
Oh, quag. I'm in check.

31:19.980 --> 31:21.520
and so well fed

31:23.530 --> 31:27.430
that a nosey chicken is more a pet than picking.

31:28.310 --> 31:29.870
By the way, what's with the chicken?

31:30.650 --> 31:32.350
Well, that's Wilson.

31:32.660 --> 31:33.550
He's my new friend.

31:33.920 --> 31:36.250
So with their short term survival sorted,

31:36.520 --> 31:39.110
the "Mythbusters" are dreaming of one final thing.

31:39.620 --> 31:40.390
Escape.

31:42.730 --> 31:44.580
We made ourselves a nice little home on this island.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.160
Duct tape provided us everything we need.

31:47.330 --> 31:49.150
Food, fire, water.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.000
We can stay here as long as we like,

31:51.000 --> 31:52.180
but rescue is not coming.

31:52.340 --> 31:54.360
It is time for us to get ourselves off this island.

31:54.820 --> 31:57.830
In other words, it is time to build a boat.

31:58.090 --> 32:00.880
So cue the banian tree brainstorm.

32:01.210 --> 32:03.090
So we gotta make a duct tape boat,

32:03.420 --> 32:05.300
and it's gotta be ocean worthy for

32:05.400 --> 32:07.190
probably a significant distance.

32:07.190 --> 32:08.910
We're gonna have to have a couple weeks' worth of water

32:09.000 --> 32:10.560
couple of weeks worth of food.

32:11.300 --> 32:13.050
- Bailers. - Bailers. Yeah.

32:13.050 --> 32:16.130
It's gonna have to be pretty good size, like 20 feet or so.

32:16.250 --> 32:17.550
What about a canoe design,

32:17.590 --> 32:18.180
where we paddle it.

32:18.670 --> 32:21.110
Yeah, a canoe design is pretty efficient.

32:21.240 --> 32:23.270
But if we do that, we have to make outriggers.

32:23.510 --> 32:25.450
You mean like one of those pontoon things off to the side.

32:25.460 --> 32:26.450
Yeah, for stability.

32:26.740 --> 32:29.120
We'll make it all out of duct tape and bamboo.

32:29.330 --> 32:30.700
It's light and it's strong.

32:31.110 --> 32:32.240
- Let's do it.  - OK.

32:32.870 --> 32:35.010
Our boat design is straightforward.

32:35.020 --> 32:36.280
It's basically gonna be a canoe,

32:36.690 --> 32:38.490
It's gonna be about 20 feet long.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.670
This should be plenty of room for both me and Jamie

32:40.670 --> 32:42.520
and all the provisions we're going to need

32:42.520 --> 32:44.050
for our ocean journey.

32:44.210 --> 32:46.950
The canoe will also have an outrigger for stability.

32:47.370 --> 32:49.590
Its frame could be made of bamboo,

32:49.970 --> 32:53.910
and it's going to be skinned in several layers of duct tape.

32:54.830 --> 32:56.780
Said like that, it sounds easy.

32:57.770 --> 33:00.430
- Bamboo. - We can totally use this.

33:01.050 --> 33:04.100
But this project will put all of their other island

33:04.100 --> 33:06.280
innovations firmly in the shame.

33:09.790 --> 33:10.870
But for the first one,

33:10.880 --> 33:14.000
we had steel and a welder to make the frame.

33:14.820 --> 33:15.810
It's pretty.

33:16.240 --> 33:20.670
Out here, all we've got is this stuff and duct tape.

33:21.070 --> 33:22.930
That's a whole different kettle of fish.

33:23.490 --> 33:26.790
So you kind of have to build your own work table,

33:26.790 --> 33:27.560
your own jig.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.910
'Cause otherwise, you end up with this stuff

33:30.510 --> 33:31.860
full of dirt and pine needles

33:31.860 --> 33:33.030
and everything is all sloppy.

33:33.840 --> 33:34.460
We can't have that,

33:34.460 --> 33:37.130
especially when we're talking about a waterproof boat.

33:37.360 --> 33:38.850
So having jerry-rigged a jig,

33:39.000 --> 33:39.920
Perfect.

33:40.690 --> 33:42.480
Adam and Jamie first focus on

33:42.480 --> 33:44.090
the canoe's bamboo mainframe,

33:44.390 --> 33:45.750
starting with the sides.

33:46.530 --> 33:47.080
Look at that.

33:47.350 --> 33:49.120
That's already feeling like a boat.

33:50.110 --> 33:52.530
One in front, one in back paddling.

33:53.040 --> 33:55.490
Yeah, this is just wide enough to sit inside there.

33:56.820 --> 33:59.610
Next, the guys turn their attention to the hull's base.

34:00.580 --> 34:01.740
That's gonna be awesome.

34:02.510 --> 34:05.140
Then they position a myriad of internal cross struts

34:05.460 --> 34:06.810
for maximum strengths.

34:08.690 --> 34:12.440
Everything of course, bound together with duct tape.

34:12.639 --> 34:14.690
The boat design we have here is basically a canoe,

34:15.170 --> 34:17.639
and that's fine if you're on a lake, but we're not.

34:17.900 --> 34:18.750
We are on the ocean,

34:18.750 --> 34:22.060
and we need a lot more stability so we don't tip over in the waves.

34:22.650 --> 34:24.739
You know, the traditional way of dealing with that

34:24.840 --> 34:26.110
is with an outrigger,

34:26.429 --> 34:27.940
and so that's what we're gonna put on this.

34:28.280 --> 34:31.080
The outrigger is like the canoe's baby brother.

34:32.199 --> 34:34.070
It, too, has a bamboo frame.

34:34.800 --> 34:35.780
Well, that ought to work.

34:36.350 --> 34:38.690
And it, too, needs a duct tape skin.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.139
We're gonna skin this boat once with the tape facing out.

34:45.520 --> 34:47.590
Attention to detail means the boat doesn't leak.

34:48.370 --> 34:50.560
And we're gonna skin it again with the tape facing in.

34:51.889 --> 34:53.989
My fingers are raw from being

34:54.969 --> 34:56.520
stuck to tape repeatedly.

34:58.450 --> 35:02.700
This should give us a really secure, leathery duct tape skin.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.130
Hopefully it keeps the water out

35:04.330 --> 35:05.450
and gets us home.

35:05.890 --> 35:07.610
You know, Adam, I sure hope this works.

35:08.850 --> 35:10.960
You and me both, man.

35:11.590 --> 35:13.330
It's a time-consuming,

35:13.710 --> 35:14.350
Getting closer.

35:15.160 --> 35:17.400
and somewhat painful process.

35:18.220 --> 35:21.290
All this sticky stuff is giving me nightmares.

35:21.870 --> 35:26.540
After a full six hours, their rescue raft is as good as done.

35:31.550 --> 35:32.390
Look at that!

35:33.100 --> 35:34.850
I think this is gonna work great.

35:34.850 --> 35:37.380
That is really, really pretty.

35:37.480 --> 35:38.910
A couple dozen rows of duct tape,

35:38.910 --> 35:42.410
couple hundred feet of bamboo and some ingenuity,

35:42.410 --> 35:45.560
I am super pleased with how the boat has turned out.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.540
My fingers are raw from tearing

35:47.540 --> 35:49.640
so many thousands of pieces of tape.

35:49.680 --> 35:52.060
I think it might just be sea worthy.

35:52.830 --> 35:55.710
The "Mythbusters" canoe confidence is high.

35:55.960 --> 35:57.600
But with sunset approaching,

35:57.600 --> 35:58.680
That's it.

35:59.090 --> 36:00.800
Those are all of our provisions.

36:01.080 --> 36:03.620
her maiden voyage has to wait.

36:04.780 --> 36:07.710
Coming up, in the finale of the duct tape island special,

36:08.090 --> 36:12.400
will it be sink or swim for Adam and Jamie's canoe?

36:13.270 --> 36:14.580
Here we go!

36:22.470 --> 36:25.560
The "Mythbusters" duct tape island adventure

36:25.560 --> 36:28.470
has been eventful, to say the least.

36:30.590 --> 36:32.540
Jamie and I, we've had our highs.

36:33.100 --> 36:34.220
I got the chicken!

36:35.540 --> 36:36.800
we've had our lows.

36:36.890 --> 36:38.500
I'm thirsty and I actually think I've got

36:38.890 --> 36:40.920
ants in my hair.

36:40.930 --> 36:42.930
And now we've determined that it's time to go home.

36:42.930 --> 36:46.240
So we built ourselves a boat.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.070
We have provisioned it for at least a few weeks at sea,

36:49.070 --> 36:52.460
and soon we're about to head out into the great blue yonder

36:52.460 --> 36:54.350
to try to get ourselves home.

36:55.220 --> 36:58.110
And when Adam says they provisioned it for a few weeks,

36:58.250 --> 37:00.070
he is not exaggerating.

37:00.390 --> 37:02.050
Here is what we're taking on the journey.

37:02.050 --> 37:04.390
We got rope, we got fishing line.

37:04.390 --> 37:07.390
We got bailers, oars, duct tape.

37:07.390 --> 37:10.060
We have tarps. We have water bags,

37:10.060 --> 37:12.910
food bags, and a fishing speer.

37:12.930 --> 37:15.850
That doesn't help us make it, we weren't meant to.

37:17.150 --> 37:19.140
I think we're ready to put it in, huh?

37:19.400 --> 37:21.310
- Let's carry it out. - All right.

37:21.900 --> 37:23.190
At this point we found that

37:23.190 --> 37:26.570
duct tape is not a perfect solution for anything.

37:27.140 --> 37:30.100
But with some creativity in a pinch,

37:30.340 --> 37:33.830
it's an adequate solution for just about everything.

37:34.140 --> 37:36.550
Now, whether it will hold up to a boat

37:36.590 --> 37:39.000
that has to get us across the ocean,

37:39.160 --> 37:41.420
there's only one way to find out.

37:42.250 --> 37:43.420
Okay.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.380
And in it joins the waves.

37:48.620 --> 37:50.470
As the guys clamor in,

37:52.630 --> 37:53.570
it's worth highlighting

37:53.570 --> 37:57.250
that the one thing they don't have is a map.

37:57.960 --> 37:59.040
It's working.

37:59.290 --> 38:00.390
Oh, yeah, baby!

38:00.390 --> 38:01.570
Like real castaways,

38:01.570 --> 38:06.400
they're simply going to paddle until they find land or sink.

38:06.990 --> 38:08.480
Pontoon is looking great.

38:08.480 --> 38:10.570
But with the breaking waves approaching,

38:10.720 --> 38:13.300
sinking is a very real possibility.

38:13.300 --> 38:15.100
Oh, no, here we go.

38:17.830 --> 38:19.100
It took it.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.510
There's another one coming.

38:20.660 --> 38:21.670
It is bigger.

38:23.150 --> 38:24.090
Dude!

38:24.820 --> 38:25.940
There we go!

38:31.260 --> 38:32.890
There's no two ways about it.

38:32.890 --> 38:35.030
Those breakers were intense.

38:37.950 --> 38:40.860
We're sitting there in the canoe made of duct tape,

38:41.210 --> 38:44.250
paddling towards waves that're three or four feet higher

38:44.250 --> 38:46.360
than the prow of our boat.

38:48.290 --> 38:51.250
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

38:51.250 --> 38:53.260
It was absolutely terrifying.

38:53.260 --> 38:54.860
But once the minute past,

38:57.020 --> 39:00.280
totally knew we have passed one of the worst hurdles we could

39:00.280 --> 39:02.380
and the boat was gonna be okay.

39:02.900 --> 39:05.730
Adam's right. Having survived the breakers,

39:05.730 --> 39:07.800
How does she look like she's holding up in the water?

39:07.800 --> 39:09.330
the main question now,

39:09.330 --> 39:10.280
Looking great.

39:10.280 --> 39:12.530
is whether the canoe will hold together

39:12.530 --> 39:15.520
long enough for them to find civilization.

39:17.270 --> 39:18.930
Man, it is hot out here.

39:19.390 --> 39:22.090
Given that we're in the ocean and it is about 90 degrees,

39:22.090 --> 39:23.910
we got bold in spades,

39:23.910 --> 39:26.620
but the only bailing I'm having to do so far

39:26.620 --> 39:28.790
Adam, I've got a little water back here.

39:28.790 --> 39:30.950
is because of water that's being splashed into the boat

39:30.950 --> 39:32.970
rather than any sort of leak.

39:32.970 --> 39:35.020
Are you saying my oar technique sucks?

39:35.130 --> 39:38.750
Two hours in and with their island now a distant memory,

39:39.450 --> 39:41.600
I can't see the shore anymore.

39:41.670 --> 39:42.850
We are in open water now.

39:42.850 --> 39:45.700
Adam and Jamie start raiding their provisions.

39:46.020 --> 39:47.320
First water.

39:48.130 --> 39:48.830
You want some?

39:48.830 --> 39:50.120
And then food.

39:51.220 --> 39:54.270
Three hours in, an impromptu fishing stop

39:54.270 --> 39:55.370
There. Right there.

39:56.630 --> 39:58.500
is all that slowed them down.

39:59.470 --> 40:00.570
I think you missed it.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.980
As three hours becomes four,

40:03.250 --> 40:04.110
Dude,

40:04.630 --> 40:06.320
I'm gonna take a little break, okay?

40:06.670 --> 40:08.950
and four becomes five.

40:08.970 --> 40:11.860
Let's just hope we're not paddling in circles.

40:12.150 --> 40:16.130
Let's put this maritime masterpiece in contest.

40:16.260 --> 40:18.410
Adam and Jamie's yesterday's news,

40:18.410 --> 40:20.160
I'm kicking the world.

40:20.970 --> 40:23.100
broke apart in twenty minutes.

40:23.160 --> 40:26.590
The duct tape dinghy was on the water not much longer,

40:26.590 --> 40:28.800
Try not to push your feet through the bottom.

40:28.800 --> 40:32.820
and their Alcatraz escape raft was an accident waiting to happen.

40:32.820 --> 40:34.730
I have no idea where we are.

40:35.950 --> 40:39.150
But their duct tape canoe has now been in the open ocean

40:39.150 --> 40:40.880
for over a half day,

40:40.980 --> 40:42.890
and is still going strong.

40:43.160 --> 40:45.480
This boat, strongest case yet.

40:45.480 --> 40:47.790
The duct tape is a fricking miracle material.

40:47.800 --> 40:51.580
Yep, there's no underestimating in the power of duct tape.

40:51.640 --> 40:53.860
With neither a leak nor a tear,

40:53.860 --> 40:56.060
you might say it has been plain sailing.

40:56.170 --> 40:57.570
And what's more.

40:57.800 --> 41:00.130
Dude, land!

41:00.130 --> 41:01.130
I see it.

41:01.690 --> 41:02.920
At last,

41:02.920 --> 41:05.260
after close to seven hours at sea,

41:05.260 --> 41:07.990
land looms large on the horizon.

41:08.160 --> 41:09.980
Dude, we are saved.

41:10.440 --> 41:11.610
I think so.

41:11.610 --> 41:14.990
And what that means is it's mission accomplished!

41:15.530 --> 41:18.650
Because their final challenge to build a sea worthy boat

41:18.650 --> 41:21.260
and escape their myth worthy deserted island

41:21.260 --> 41:25.030
has like all their other duct tape demands

41:25.030 --> 41:26.740
been a total triumph.

41:26.990 --> 41:29.360
I can't believe this boat actually held up.

41:29.360 --> 41:30.380
I know!

41:31.080 --> 41:33.160
Our little duct tape boat did great.

41:35.410 --> 41:36.890
Held up through the breakers,

41:37.660 --> 41:39.090
Here we go.

41:40.970 --> 41:43.920
held up in the open water and it held up in the sun.

41:47.160 --> 41:50.290
And it did that despite only weighing about 100 pounds.

41:51.170 --> 41:52.530
- I'm out.  - I'm out.

41:52.530 --> 41:55.630
which for a boat that size is incredibly light weight.

41:56.030 --> 41:56.790
I've got to say,

41:56.790 --> 41:59.800
I'm pretty impressed with the duct tape right now.

41:59.800 --> 42:00.940
Excellent.

42:02.030 --> 42:04.040
Well, duct tape this stuff

42:04.090 --> 42:05.910
not only did it help us climb on the island

42:05.910 --> 42:07.490
and it helps us get off the island.

42:07.490 --> 42:10.450
And ultimately, it helps us find civilization.

42:11.520 --> 42:12.610
Adam.

42:13.060 --> 42:14.610
It's the same island.

42:21.170 --> 42:23.540
Have you had enough? Of course you haven't.
