♪♪

00:11.178 --> 00:15.981
You guys, it is our first
Rooney family Christmas
in California!

00:15.983 --> 00:17.016
Who's excited?

00:17.018 --> 00:18.650
Oh, you know I am!

00:18.652 --> 00:21.220
Here, everyday is shorts weather

00:21.222 --> 00:24.623
and my sculpted calves
can finally breathe.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.091
Wa-cha-chow!

00:27.528 --> 00:29.461
Ah, ladies likey.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.798
Joey, nobody likey.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.868
In fact, um...

00:35.870 --> 00:38.237
everybody hatey.

00:39.807 --> 00:43.509
Why is Dad coming out here
next week to this sun-blasted
wasteland?

00:43.511 --> 00:46.211
We should all be going
to Wisconsin.

00:46.213 --> 00:49.982
Don't you guys want a Christmas
where the slush spills
into your boots

00:49.984 --> 00:52.317
and freezes your toes
until you, like,
scream in pain?

00:54.388 --> 00:56.588
I love wearing boots,

00:56.590 --> 00:59.258
the rest of that sounds
really awful.

01:00.995 --> 01:02.494
What do you want
for Christmas?

01:02.496 --> 01:04.430
I don't know, Liv.
I can't think about Christmas.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.265
It's like 90 degrees.

01:06.267 --> 01:10.235
Actually, it's 82 with chance
of handsome weatherman
coming your way!

01:10.237 --> 01:12.337
All:
Johnny Nimbus!

01:12.339 --> 01:15.541
Oh, Rooney Family!
You are a sight for sore eyes.

01:15.543 --> 01:18.777
And I do mean my eyes are sore
'cause I've been crying.

01:20.848 --> 01:25.350
Yeah, it's tough to break in
as a weatherman in a city
where it's always sunny!

01:26.854 --> 01:29.188
Well, I know you've been
working a little.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.890
Your lovely wife Gemma and I
have been listening to you do

01:31.892 --> 01:33.926
play-by-play
for Mexican wrestlers.

01:33.928 --> 01:39.832
Oh!<i> Sí , sí . La Federacion</i>
<i>de Combate Mortal</i>
<i>es muy bueno.</i>

01:41.769 --> 01:45.304
<i>Y tambien,</i> I'm hosting
the holiday toy drive
here at The Cove.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.773
That's amazing.
We just donated some toys.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.109
Yeah, hopefully it will put
some smiles on kids' faces.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.710
Oh, that's great!

01:51.712 --> 01:55.280
Hey, stop by tomorrow.
I'm hosting the best
Santa contest.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.616
The winner gets to hand out
toy donations

01:57.618 --> 01:59.451
to kids who wouldn't
otherwise have presents.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.486
Oh, I am in!

02:00.488 --> 02:03.088
I love handing out
toys to kids

02:03.090 --> 02:05.457
because they are forced
to like you.

02:07.394 --> 02:09.128
No flaws in that logic.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.263
Well, I got
a Christmas tree to light.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.898
Oh, hey.

02:12.900 --> 02:16.168
Look at that, Maddie.
Johnny Nimbus lighting
the Christmas tree.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.787
It's like we're back
in Stevens Point.

02:18.788 --> 02:21.405
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That actually does make me feel
a little bit better.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.842
Hello, holiday shoppers!

02:23.844 --> 02:25.978
Who's ready to light
this candle, huh?

02:25.980 --> 02:27.579
(cheering)

02:27.581 --> 02:29.314
(drumroll)

02:29.316 --> 02:30.415
(fanfare)

02:32.419 --> 02:34.319
Seriously?

02:34.321 --> 02:37.289
Dude, a palm tree is not
a Christmas tree.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.590
You know what?
I'm gonna get out of here

02:38.592 --> 02:41.326
before somebody hangs kale
instead of mistletoe.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.532
Joey, I just thought of
the perfect present for Maddie.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.934
-Yeah?
-I'm gonna give her
a Wisconsin Christmas!

02:48.936 --> 02:51.436
Oh, that's a good idea.
What are you getting me?

02:51.438 --> 02:52.471
Pants.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.634

still standing.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.805
This family just does not
let things go!

04:01.075 --> 04:03.175
Sweetie, that's
how families work.

04:04.511 --> 04:08.213
So, Liv asked me to make
a gingerbread version
of our house.

04:08.215 --> 04:12.384
She is giving Maddie
a surprise Wisconsin Christmas
because she is homesick.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.620
Homesick for what?

04:14.622 --> 04:16.555
The cold, the ice,
the howling wind?

04:16.557 --> 04:18.924
The only thing that I miss
are snow days.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.892
What's a snow day?

04:20.894 --> 04:22.694
Oh, Ruby,
sometimes in Wisconsin,

04:22.696 --> 04:26.298
it snows so much
that they cancel school.

04:26.300 --> 04:30.135
You mean you get a day off
school and you don't even
have to fake being sick?

04:31.639 --> 04:33.972
Because I hear some kids
will fake being sick.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.610
Yeah, one time we got
a whole week off of school.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.512
I forgot how to spell!

04:41.582 --> 04:44.516
Man, I wish we had snow days
here in Santa Luego!

04:46.320 --> 04:48.053
Challenge accepted!

04:49.657 --> 04:52.791
One snow day experience
for my Cali cuz coming up.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.595
This chimney looks
delicious.

04:56.597 --> 04:57.963
(alarm blaring)

04:59.633 --> 05:03.535
Yeah, I took precautions
so you wouldn't destroy
our house again.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.375
Ah!

05:12.613 --> 05:14.813
Ho, ho, ho!

05:14.815 --> 05:19.685
Merry Christmas, family.
Ho, ho!

05:19.687 --> 05:23.388
Mom, your light placement
is awful.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.925
The Santa look is great
on you, Joe.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.528
I totally think you're gonna
win this contest.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.864
Oh, yeah. It is not
my first time rocking
the red suit.

05:32.866 --> 05:36.601
Plus, I just happen
to have a collection
of white wizard beards.

05:36.603 --> 05:37.569
Oh.

05:39.306 --> 05:42.374
Okay, well, hurry home
because we are surprising Maddie

05:42.376 --> 05:43.975
with a Wisconsin Christmas

05:43.977 --> 05:45.777
right after
her team holiday party.

05:45.779 --> 05:49.014
Oh, yeah. Sounds like
you're planning quite
the Christmas spectacle.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.516
Yeah, yeah. We just need to add
the Wisconsin,

05:51.518 --> 05:54.019
so I ordered some brisket
from Beef McGravy's

05:54.021 --> 05:56.888
and our family ornaments
are coming.

05:56.890 --> 06:00.826
They were in the garage,
the one place you and Parker
didn't destroy.

06:00.828 --> 06:04.363
Santa says,
ho, ho, ho,

06:04.365 --> 06:06.365
let it go.

06:08.569 --> 06:12.371
But wait, honey. How are you
gonna get the ornaments?
Dad's not coming till next week.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.639
They are coming with
one more super-cool,

06:14.641 --> 06:17.743
I'm-an-amazing-sister
thing for Maddie's Wisconsin
Christmas.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.378
-(doorbell rings)
-(squeals)

06:22.983 --> 06:24.716
-(gasps)
-Merry Christmas!

06:24.718 --> 06:26.585
-Diggie!
-Diggie!

06:26.587 --> 06:28.720
Santa answered my letters.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.456
Oh!

06:36.597 --> 06:39.164
Hey, thank you so much
for bringing these, Diggie.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.767
Yeah, thanks for flying me out
to surprise Maddie.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.602
I just would have been
stuck at home all weekend
with Artie.

06:43.604 --> 06:47.072
He and the minions are
into Double Dutch recently.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.675
It's really weird.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.779
So how was your flight?

06:53.781 --> 06:55.280
Good, thank you
for asking.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.516
Although, I am kind of
regretting holding takeout

06:57.518 --> 06:58.717
from Beef McGravy's
the whole way.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.586
-(sniffs)
-Oh, no, don't be.

07:01.588 --> 07:02.754
You smell like home.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.457
(both sniffing)

07:05.459 --> 07:06.925
Mmm!

07:06.927 --> 07:09.661
And you got
mashed potatoes too. Ah!

07:11.031 --> 07:15.033
Gravy and nostalgia. Maddie
is gonna love this Christmas!

07:17.271 --> 07:19.304
-(groans)
-(door slams)

07:19.306 --> 07:21.773
I hate this Christmas!

07:23.043 --> 07:25.644
Maddie, honey,
what you doin' home?

07:25.646 --> 07:28.380
You were supposed to be
at your team holiday party.

07:28.382 --> 07:29.915
Yeah, I was.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.117
I was at a pool party.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.385
Oh! Mm.

07:33.387 --> 07:35.687
A Christmas party...
at a pool!

07:37.891 --> 07:40.125
I mean, who does that?

07:40.127 --> 07:42.127
-Californians.
-Yeah.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.964
Okay, ooh.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.134
Wait. Why are we hiding?

07:49.136 --> 07:50.669
Let's just tell Maddie I'm here.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.471
No! No, no, no.
No, we can't do that.

07:52.473 --> 07:55.507
I mean, everything's
not set up yet,
and it has to be perfect.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.945
Do I smell...
Beef McGravy's?

07:59.947 --> 08:02.180
That is impossible.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.582
-You're just homesick.
-Mom--

08:03.584 --> 08:04.649
Don't go in
the kitchen, Maddie!

08:04.651 --> 08:06.051
Maddie's coming!

08:08.355 --> 08:09.754
Surprise!

08:14.194 --> 08:15.393
What surprise?

08:16.296 --> 08:19.664
Surprise! You made it
into the first paragraph

08:19.666 --> 08:22.367
of the Rooney Roundup
Holiday Newsletter.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.205
Ugh! Of course
there's no Beef McGravy's.

08:28.442 --> 08:29.975
Maddie, no! No!

08:29.977 --> 08:31.443
No!

08:31.445 --> 08:32.711
"No," what?

08:33.780 --> 08:35.614
Know this song?

08:35.616 --> 08:39.284
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way ♪

08:39.286 --> 08:43.154
♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh ♪

08:43.156 --> 08:44.689
You know, it's "Jingle Bells."

08:48.128 --> 08:50.795
(gasps, pants)

08:52.799 --> 08:55.901
-That was
a very close call.
-Yes.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.503
We should get Maddie's
surprise set up before
she comes back down.

08:58.505 --> 09:01.640
Yes, I completely agree.
But first...

09:01.642 --> 09:03.074
one more hit of home.

09:03.076 --> 09:06.244
(both sniffing)

09:06.246 --> 09:08.179
Oh, that's the stuff.

09:08.181 --> 09:09.714
This is so weird.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.116
Mm!

09:15.055 --> 09:17.322
Hello, shoppers!

09:17.324 --> 09:20.892
It is time for our
Mr. North Pole Santa Contest.

09:20.894 --> 09:24.563
Time to find the best Santa
in Santa Luego!

09:24.565 --> 09:28.533
Hey! And if you like this show,
don't forget to donate a toy

09:28.535 --> 09:30.735
to our holiday gift drive,
all right?

09:30.737 --> 09:33.405
But now, let's meet
Santa wannabe number one.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.908
Ho, ho, ho-ey.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.711
It's Santa Joey.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.746
Ho, ho!

09:41.748 --> 09:45.216
Drop a present
in the toy drive bin

09:45.218 --> 09:48.954
and I'll put you
on my nice list.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.755
(laughs)

09:51.925 --> 09:54.726
All right, without further ado,

09:54.728 --> 09:56.294
let's meet Santa number two.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.904
No gut? No beard?

10:05.906 --> 10:08.807
Have they even heard
of Christmas out here?

10:08.809 --> 10:11.776
This Kringle is gonna crush it.

10:11.778 --> 10:15.246
And now it's time
for our final Santa.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.716
Man:
Drop that tasty Christmas beat.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.852
("Jingle Bells"
thumping over speakers)

10:34.134 --> 10:36.935
Todd Stetson?

10:36.937 --> 10:39.137
What are you doing
in California?

10:39.139 --> 10:42.173
Wisconsin couldn't contain
all this Toddness.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.909
And ditch the shirt,
you're killing the mood.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.813
Okay, Todd. Uh...

10:48.815 --> 10:53.385
But nothing about you
says Santa.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.454
Well, me and my reindeer
beg to differ.

10:56.456 --> 11:00.825
Meet Dasher, Prancer, Comet,
Donner, Blitzen, and Cheryl.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.761
(cheering)

11:02.763 --> 11:05.563
Okay, there's no reindeer
named Cheryl, Todd.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.099
The audience doesn't care, Joey.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.002
Todd Stetson's running away
with this Mr. North Pole thing.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.872
(cheering)

11:20.981 --> 11:22.781
I'm ready for my snow day!

11:22.783 --> 11:24.149
What do we do first?

11:24.151 --> 11:26.051
This is how
a snow day works.

11:26.053 --> 11:29.220
It's been snowing all night,
and now we huddle around
the radio

11:29.222 --> 11:31.289
to see if our schools
are closed.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.027
Nimbus:
<i>Hello, children of Los Angeles!</i>

11:36.029 --> 11:40.565
<i>Johnny Nimbus is here</i>
<i>to announce the school closings</i>
<i>during this snow storm.</i>

11:40.567 --> 11:43.468
I had Johnny Nimbus record
a fake radio broadcast

11:43.470 --> 11:46.037
to make it authentic for Ruby.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.273
He also recorded
some classic Christmas songs.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.876
But that's for me!

11:51.878 --> 11:53.878
Nimbus:
<i>The following schools</i>
<i>will be closed:</i>

11:53.880 --> 11:58.650
<i>Woodfax Elementary,</i>
<i>Valley North Academy,</i>

11:58.652 --> 12:00.418
<i>Larsen Middle School,</i>

12:00.420 --> 12:02.087
<i>BOOMS.</i>

12:02.089 --> 12:04.489
BOOMS, yes!
Snow day.

12:04.491 --> 12:09.661
<i>Also, kids who work on...</i>
♪ Sing It Louder! ♪

12:09.663 --> 12:11.362
<i>Yeah!</i>

12:11.364 --> 12:14.499
Sweet! What now?

12:14.501 --> 12:17.969
No school? Time to change
back into our pajamas.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.609
I love snow days.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.016
Can this get any better?

12:32.018 --> 12:35.787
Well, in Wisconsin, we'd go
outside and build a snowman,

12:35.789 --> 12:37.122
go sledding,
and have a snowball fight.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.090
That sounds awesome!

12:39.092 --> 12:40.992
Too bad we don't have any snow.

12:42.129 --> 12:45.363
Oh, Ruby.
You poor child.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.968
When did you
stop dreaming?

12:53.306 --> 12:56.307
And our Mr. North Pole
Santa Contest

12:56.309 --> 12:58.076
is down to two finalists!

12:58.078 --> 12:59.377
Santa Todd.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.879
(cheering)

13:00.881 --> 13:02.647
And Santa Joey.

13:07.921 --> 13:11.823
Next up, they're gonna
show us what they think
Christmas should look like.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.458
First up,
Santa Todd.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.794
(cheering)

13:15.796 --> 13:19.230
I will be making a toy
with two power tools.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.471
Joey:
Okay.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.240
You're not even
making anything.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.110
Sure I am.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.179
I'm making Los Angeles swoon.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.881
(cheering)

13:39.452 --> 13:41.986
-Sorry, Joey,
just not your night.
-Aah!

13:41.988 --> 13:44.022
This crowd loves them
some Todd Stetson.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.291
-(camera clicks)
-Joey: I don't
get it, Johnny.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.761
I mean, I could obviously
bust out my arm cannons

13:49.763 --> 13:55.200
and wow this crowd,
but... that's not what
Christmas is all about.

13:55.202 --> 13:59.204
Well, Joey, why don't you
show these people what
you think Christmas looks like.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.105
You know what, Johnny,

14:01.107 --> 14:02.607
I will.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.475
But I need reinforcements,

14:04.477 --> 14:05.977
so can you stall for me?

14:05.979 --> 14:08.513
(scoffs) Did you just ask
Johnny Nimbus to fill time?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.949
Hello, Angelenos!

14:13.653 --> 14:17.155
I cannot wait to see
the shocked look on Maddie's
cute little homesick face.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.357
Yay. Okay,
so when she opens the box,

14:19.359 --> 14:21.159
you jump out and you yell,

14:21.161 --> 14:22.961
"Merry Wisconsin Christmas!"

14:22.963 --> 14:25.230
-Okay, got it.
-Okay. Okay.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.665
Okay, so I know that
you think you got it,

14:27.667 --> 14:31.369
but just trust me on this,
your instinct is going to be
to yell, "Surprise!"

14:31.371 --> 14:34.038
Yeah, but I won't. I'll yell,
"Merry Wisconsin Christmas."

14:35.242 --> 14:36.975
Okay. Yeah, no, good.

14:37.911 --> 14:40.311
Just... do it better than that.

14:42.849 --> 14:45.850
So, you will not be able to open
the box from the inside.
I'm gonna go get Maddie.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.051
-Okay.
All right.
-Okay.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.020
-Oh, oh, oh! Oh.
-What? What?

14:49.022 --> 14:51.256
Okay. What if we have, like,
a bunch of balloons in here

14:51.258 --> 14:53.258
and then when the box opens,
the balloons go everywhere!

14:53.260 --> 14:54.926
-That'd be so crazy!
Diggie, get in the box.
-Yeah.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.197
But, okay,
you can pick out the color,
and I'll blow them up myself.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.532
Okay. Yay.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.002
All right,
nice and cozy.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.838
I'm gonna go get Maddie
and she's gonna be so excited.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.506
Diggie:
Okay, hurry back.
It's dark in here, Liv.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.275
No talking in the box!

15:19.085 --> 15:20.852
Ho, ho, ho.

15:20.854 --> 15:23.321
This is all gonna go.

15:26.793 --> 15:30.094
It was time to show
that jerk, Todd Stetson,

15:30.096 --> 15:32.764
the true meaning of Christmas.

15:32.766 --> 15:36.234
By stealing
my family's Christmas.

15:36.236 --> 15:40.204
(humming "Deck the Halls")

15:45.278 --> 15:48.813
(humming "Deck the Halls"
aggressively)

15:51.251 --> 15:53.618
Why am I walking
down the stairs
with a hat over my eyes?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.320
Okay, I know it seems
really dangerous,

15:55.322 --> 15:57.488
but trust me, it's all gonna be
worth it when you see...

15:58.458 --> 15:59.824
Nothing!

16:02.128 --> 16:04.228
Somebody stole Christmas!

16:05.298 --> 16:07.131
And I mean,
you know, Diggie.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.567
But they stole Christmas!

16:12.005 --> 16:15.306
Um... okay.
You know what?
False alarm.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.841
Back to your room.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.479
Liv, little help?
Please.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.547
Ow!

16:28.021 --> 16:31.322
-Come on, Diggie, pick up!
-(line ringing)

16:31.324 --> 16:32.824
-(beep)
-Hello?

16:32.826 --> 16:34.759
Diggie, where are you?

16:34.761 --> 16:36.494
I don't know,
where are you taking me?

16:39.299 --> 16:41.332
No, I'm not taking you anywhere.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.901
Okay, well,
I'm going somewhere.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.205
(Joey humming)

16:47.207 --> 16:49.240
And I think I hear Joey.

16:50.443 --> 16:54.512
(scoffs) Joey.
Okay, I know where
he's taking you.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.948
Liv:
<i>I'll be right there.</i>
<i>Do not move!</i>

16:56.950 --> 16:59.584
I can't move,
I'm in a box.

16:59.585 --> 17:02.219
Um, Liv, will you just
keep talking to me?
It's kind of dark in here.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.322
Liv? Liv?

17:07.460 --> 17:10.028
You're about to see snow
for the first time.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.295
How do you feel?

17:11.297 --> 17:14.966
Super sweaty,
but excited for
the possibilities.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.702
Well, brace yourself for...

17:20.173 --> 17:23.274
Dr. P's
Snow-Day-On-Demand Machine.

17:24.344 --> 17:25.243
Who's Dr. P?

17:25.245 --> 17:28.880
Uh... you're looking at him,
sunshine.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.349
Okay.

17:31.351 --> 17:34.819
Well, um, "sunshine" is gonna
keep calling you Parker.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.222
Oh, you'll come around.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.259
(whirring)

17:41.261 --> 17:42.393
(rumbling)

17:43.263 --> 17:45.430
Whoa!

17:45.432 --> 17:47.398
You made a cloud.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.269
Oh, cool!

17:51.271 --> 17:53.004
It's snowing!

17:54.441 --> 17:56.741
Well, I promised you
a snow day.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.410
You're amazing, Dr. P.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.917
What'd that take,
five seconds? Ten?

18:07.053 --> 18:09.987
They all come around to Dr. P.

18:12.292 --> 18:17.562
And that's the difference
between a Doppler radar
and a mega-Doppler radar.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.197
Johnny! Johnny! Johnny!

18:19.199 --> 18:21.966
-Oh.
-Thanks for stalling,
but...

18:21.968 --> 18:24.268
it's Santa time.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.403
Gotcha.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.106
All right, people of The Cove.

18:28.108 --> 18:32.276
Santa Joey is now gonna
show you what he thinks
Christmas should look like.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.245
So let's click, click, click...
(claps hands)

18:34.247 --> 18:35.613
for our next Saint Nick.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.219
Ho, ho, ho!

18:41.221 --> 18:45.556
This is what Christmas
should look like.

18:45.558 --> 18:50.161
Christmas isn't about dancing
with your shirt off.

18:51.564 --> 18:55.066
Now, who wants to sit
on old Santa's lap

18:55.068 --> 18:58.503
and tell him what you want
for Christmas?

18:59.506 --> 19:01.305
Joey!

19:01.307 --> 19:03.541
Ho, ho... Oh, no.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.478
Joey, you stole Christmas.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.913
Uh...

19:08.915 --> 19:11.315
Say it ain't so,
Santa Joe.

19:13.153 --> 19:16.053
Maddie, get over here!
Come see your
Christmas surprise.

19:19.926 --> 19:23.928
Hmm... My surprise is
Todd Stetson with his shirt off?

19:25.598 --> 19:26.898
You're welcome.

19:28.368 --> 19:31.469
Okay. No, not Todd Stetson.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.204
Look at the tree!

19:33.206 --> 19:37.041
Liv, are those
our family ornaments?

19:37.977 --> 19:39.210
Yeah.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.212
Did you do this for me?

19:41.214 --> 19:42.380
Yeah.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.350
Why did you do this
for me in the mall?

19:47.554 --> 19:49.620
-That was Joey's fault.
-Aah.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.855
He is the worst.

19:52.125 --> 19:55.593
Ho, okay.
Santa can hear you.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.330
Thank you, Liv.

19:59.332 --> 20:02.300
Oh, you are not done, Maddie.
Open your presents.

20:02.302 --> 20:05.102
Oh. (laughs) Okay.

20:08.241 --> 20:10.408
Merry Wisconsin Christmas!

20:13.546 --> 20:15.379
Dang it.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.381
Merry Wisconsin Christmas!

20:17.383 --> 20:20.585
Diggie! Hi! Hi.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.386
Merry Christmas, Maddie.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.455
Liv, seriously,
best present ever.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.392
I missed you.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.594
I missed you.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.464
(sniffing)

20:34.734 --> 20:37.602
Why do you smell
like Beef McGravy's?

20:40.073 --> 20:42.106
Because I brought some
from Wisconsin...

20:42.108 --> 20:44.008
and it's at your house.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.109
What?

20:45.111 --> 20:46.744
That's even better
than you coming!

20:46.746 --> 20:48.679
-I know! Yeah!
-Let's go!

20:51.184 --> 20:57.521
Well, looks like Santa Joey
saved Christmas!

20:58.625 --> 21:02.760
Um... Yeah, you almost
ruined everything.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.963
Exactly. Almost.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.437
Oh!

21:14.874 --> 21:16.941
I miss you so much.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.878
Are you talking about me
or the Beef McGravy's?

21:23.216 --> 21:24.515
Could it be both?

21:27.587 --> 21:30.154
Maddie, how can you
miss Wisconsin so much?

21:30.156 --> 21:32.490
It's December 23rd,
I'm laying out in the sun

21:32.492 --> 21:35.092
wearing shorts, wondering
if I should put on sunscreen.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.961
Yeah, I know.
The sun's really nice.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.730
(birds chirping)

21:41.734 --> 21:43.034
What is that sound?

21:44.003 --> 21:45.569
Uh... birds.

21:47.307 --> 21:50.408
It's December 23rd
and the birds are singing!

21:53.479 --> 21:57.181
Hey, Diggie.
You should get out there.
I just surfed with dolphins!

22:01.587 --> 22:04.388
Maddie,
it's December 23rd,

22:04.390 --> 22:06.657
it's sunny,
the birds are singing,

22:06.659 --> 22:08.192
and there are dolphins!

22:10.296 --> 22:12.263
Tell me again why
you're homesick.

22:13.433 --> 22:16.834
I mean, I'm...
not homesick right now.

22:21.674 --> 22:25.076
Is that because of me
or because of the week's worth
of Beef McGravy's?

22:26.512 --> 22:28.012
Hmm...

22:29.182 --> 22:30.581
Can it be both?

22:33.886 --> 22:35.419
-No.
-No.

22:38.124 --> 22:39.457
(sighs)

22:40.660 --> 22:42.593
It's definitely...
the Beef McGravy's.

22:44.163 --> 22:46.397
You guys, Johnny
is gonna sing.

22:46.399 --> 22:48.265
Johnny Nimbus is singing
in our house!

22:49.202 --> 22:50.634
