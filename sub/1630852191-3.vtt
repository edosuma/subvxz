<i>Every story has a beginning.</i>

01:14.824 --> 01:16.451
<i>My story begins…</i>

01:39.599 --> 01:40.600
<i>No.</i>

01:48.441 --> 01:49.859
What do you mean?

01:50.485 --> 01:52.821
What makes you think that?

01:55.782 --> 01:57.492
<i>My story begins</i>

01:58.701 --> 02:00.537
<i>with you.</i>

02:16.219 --> 02:21.641
EPISODE 3
MY PERSONAL STORY

02:22.976 --> 02:25.103
GOETHE-INSTITUT

02:25.186 --> 02:26.813
<i>Where are you from?</i>

02:26.896 --> 02:28.648
Where are you from?

02:30.108 --> 02:32.193
I'm from Korea.

02:32.777 --> 02:35.613
I'm from Korea.

02:36.698 --> 02:37.740
Where are you from?

02:38.533 --> 02:40.743
I'm from Korea.

02:40.827 --> 02:44.289
Good. Now, find a partner

02:44.372 --> 02:45.915
and practice together.

02:56.426 --> 02:59.262
"…is too big."

03:03.433 --> 03:05.101
This is my third time taking this class.

03:05.685 --> 03:06.853
I see.

03:09.188 --> 03:12.609
You're just not used to German.
It just takes time to get used to it.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.735
Right.

03:15.194 --> 03:16.529
Why are you learning German?

03:19.532 --> 03:22.160
Because I don't think
my in-laws can speak German.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.412
I see.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.751
But what's the point? I can't understand
a word of German either.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.377
This is embarrassing.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.212
That's how you learn.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.299
If you think you know everything,
you'll never learn.

03:43.014 --> 03:45.141
It's mine. Isn't it?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.935
Why is it so complicated?

03:47.018 --> 03:48.853
Because Father is still the president.

03:48.937 --> 03:52.565
So even if you own it, you must
still provide your management history.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.234
Whoever inherits it

03:54.317 --> 03:57.737
must be able to manage Taerim for a decade
and get the board's approval--

03:57.820 --> 04:00.698
I'm sure the board
will just side with Dad.

04:00.782 --> 04:04.077
The hospital director should be a doctor,
not someone who just manages--

04:04.160 --> 04:07.247
How much longer do you think
your dying father will have a say in it?

04:07.956 --> 04:09.666
We should set up a school foundation.

04:11.459 --> 04:12.502
Is that your idea?

04:19.133 --> 04:20.385
Is there a school for that?

04:21.219 --> 04:23.263
There's Gyeongseon Academy
near the hospital--

04:23.346 --> 04:24.681
I want you to answer.

04:26.849 --> 04:30.353
It's family run, but the founder's
grandson doesn't want to run it anymore.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.982
They'll give us the chairman position
if we make a financial contribution.

04:34.065 --> 04:37.068
Then will our foundation
be taking it over?

04:37.151 --> 04:38.820
Not our medical foundation.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.406
But we can turn it into a subsidiary

04:41.489 --> 04:44.117
if we change the corporate name
of the school to Taerim.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.451
What about the students?

04:46.452 --> 04:49.580
Last year, a 2,000-unit apartment
complex was built around the school.

04:49.664 --> 04:52.250
So the number of students
will be maintained.

04:52.333 --> 04:55.003
Buying a school isn't
some children's game.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.422
I'm planning to donate

04:57.505 --> 05:01.134
12 billion won's worth
of our hospital shares to the school.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.303
To reduce taxes,
I think this is the best--

05:03.386 --> 05:04.721
Reduce taxes?

05:05.513 --> 05:07.098
Those thieves.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.642
What has this country done for me?

05:10.226 --> 05:12.645
I worked my butt off.
Why are they taking my money?

05:12.729 --> 05:15.189
How do they expect me to live
after taking everything?

05:17.275 --> 05:18.109
Gosh.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.362
This is so infuriating.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.198
Where's the housekeeper?

05:25.491 --> 05:27.577
-I let her go.
-Why?

05:27.660 --> 05:31.039
Li-sa isn't in Korea anymore. Why hire
a housekeeper when we have a loafer?

05:59.901 --> 06:02.236
-Hi, Li-sa. My princess.
<i>-Hi.</i>

06:02.320 --> 06:04.530
So what time is it there?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.408
Did you eat, Li-sa?

06:10.119 --> 06:10.953
Okay.

06:18.878 --> 06:19.837
Li-sa.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.685
Okay, Li-sa. Make sure to eat well.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.271
I'll call you a bit later tomorrow…

06:55.248 --> 06:57.542
<i>St. Christina's? England?</i>

06:57.625 --> 06:59.335
Gosh. So your daughter goes there?

06:59.418 --> 07:01.587
Yes. Do you know the school?

07:01.671 --> 07:02.588
No.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.967
But I can tell by the name that
it must be expensive and good. Right?

07:06.050 --> 07:09.011
I'm not sure.
My mother-in-law chose that school.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.182
THE PAINTER IS PAINTING A PICTURE

07:17.645 --> 07:18.646
You are beautiful.

07:19.397 --> 07:20.231
Sorry?

07:20.898 --> 07:23.234
You're giving it your all.
I envy you for it.

07:23.317 --> 07:27.113
Gosh. Why would you envy me for it?
Everything is more fun when it's a hobby.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.034
You're an art major, right?

07:32.118 --> 07:33.953
Yes. My college is near Mt. Namsan.

07:34.036 --> 07:36.456
I see. That's so cool.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.002
I also liked drawing
when I was a little kid.

07:41.085 --> 07:44.839
I used to draw in my journal at night
with a flashlight on.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.760
Do you have a photo of your daughter?

07:49.844 --> 07:51.095
Yes.

08:03.149 --> 08:06.152
If you like drawing,
just draw whenever you want.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.784
-Thanks for the drink.
-Sure.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.752
What about Mother's dinner?

08:27.965 --> 08:29.008
Here.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.095
What is it?

08:34.180 --> 08:37.850
You remember all the other occasions,
but never our wedding anniversary.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.436
Right. I'm sorry.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.834
Do you not like it?
Should I get something else you need?

09:06.587 --> 09:11.008
I don't think mere words
would be enough to thank you.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.555
-What's wrong?
-I must be losing it.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.308
I really like it. I mean it.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.435
I'm so happy right now.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.525
But you'll get busier and busier,

09:27.608 --> 09:29.694
and since Li-sa is at boarding school,

09:29.777 --> 09:32.280
I just feel useless.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.241
Don't be silly.

09:35.324 --> 09:38.786
Right. I guess I have
too much time on my hands.

09:40.538 --> 09:43.124
-Then you should think about that.
-What?

09:44.709 --> 09:46.877
About what you want to do
in your spare time.

09:57.555 --> 09:58.639
Hey.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.434
People do use contés and charcoals a lot.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.436
But pencils are the best for beginners.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.315
Here. 4B pencils.

10:08.482 --> 10:10.610
-You've seen them in art classes, right?
-Yes.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.988
They are good for drawing,
adding details, and adjusting accents,

10:14.071 --> 10:16.824
but not so good when sketching
because they smudge easily.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.536
So for sketching, 2B pencils are better.

10:21.412 --> 10:24.957
These are harder, so they are better
when drawing thick lines.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.168
And…

10:27.918 --> 10:31.505
unless you're very experienced,
drawing with 6B pencils will be tough.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.760
Just remember
pencils also have their own colors.

10:36.761 --> 10:40.306
I was hesitant to learn
how to draw because of my age.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.391
But I'm glad I decided to.

10:43.392 --> 10:46.395
Even if you started late,
you can do it for a long time.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.106
There's no point starting early
if you end up quitting.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.400
I'll do it then.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.323
-Gosh. This is so nice.
-Right?

11:03.663 --> 11:04.997
<i>Don't be so formal with me.</i>

11:05.081 --> 11:06.749
In due time.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.586
I quit my job at the academy today.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.505
Thank you so much.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.052
Preparing students
for the exam is so hard.

11:18.135 --> 11:20.388
I have to only focus
on the technical aspects.

11:20.471 --> 11:21.347
Technical aspects?

11:21.430 --> 11:24.558
Some choose art because of their grades,
and some lack direction.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.645
But if we train them for a few years,
they can draw pretty well.

11:28.771 --> 11:33.025
And some of them get quite good.
Then I feel really bad for them.

11:33.109 --> 11:36.821
Why? If they improve,
doesn't it mean you've done your job?

11:38.197 --> 11:40.574
Let's say they drew for years
and got pretty good.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.577
Then they'd have no choice
but to continue drawing.

11:43.661 --> 11:46.997
But in the end, it's a waste of time
because they can't beat talent.

11:47.081 --> 11:50.292
I see. You can only say that

11:50.376 --> 11:52.670
because you are the talented one.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.923
Well, I'm different. My grandpa
worked all his life to support me,

11:56.006 --> 11:57.508
so I could pursue my dream.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.969
Failing was never an option for me.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.264
I love your confidence.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.474
I know it's tough.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.853
I don't really feel that way.
This is fun for me.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.730
I'm simple. When I like something,
I get lost in it.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.747
HANNAH

12:29.832 --> 12:32.501
-Hey.
<i>-I'm sorry, Hui-ju.</i>

12:33.544 --> 12:35.546
What's wrong? Did something happen?

12:35.629 --> 12:38.382
<i>My grandfather is hurt.
About today's lesson--</i>

12:38.466 --> 12:40.551
We can reschedule our lesson.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.678
Is he hurt badly?

12:42.761 --> 12:45.181
<i>Well, I'm not sure.</i>

12:45.264 --> 12:46.891
<i>I'll know once I get there.</i>

12:46.974 --> 12:48.851
Where are you? Let me--

12:48.934 --> 12:52.563
<i>No, Hui-ju. A close friend of mine
from school will fill in for me today.</i>

12:53.272 --> 12:54.148
What?

12:54.231 --> 12:56.066
<i>My friend will teach you instead.</i>

12:56.150 --> 12:59.778
No. We can just reschedule it…

13:02.072 --> 13:03.407
<i>That must be my friend.</i>

13:03.491 --> 13:06.160
<i>Hui-ju, I just need a few days.
I'll call you again.</i>

13:07.578 --> 13:08.662
Hannah…

14:01.006 --> 14:03.551
<i>So you're the one who brought all this</i>

14:05.427 --> 14:06.929
<i>upon yourself.</i>

14:14.853 --> 14:17.064
I don't want anything from you, Hui-ju.

14:20.609 --> 14:24.280
How can I believe you?

14:25.072 --> 14:28.492
You gave up a full-time position,
came to the school where my husband works,

14:28.576 --> 14:30.202
and assaulted my daughter.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.163
I didn't know. I'm telling the truth.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.500
After I found out, I wanted to apologize.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.335
Your apology makes me uncomfortable.

14:39.044 --> 14:42.548
You barge in here as you please
just to give me your sorry excuses.

14:45.342 --> 14:48.470
I'm sorry if I made you feel that way.

14:48.554 --> 14:49.847
Hearing that you're sorry…

14:55.227 --> 14:58.981
The person you should apologize to
is Li-sa, not me.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.734
As I told you the other day,
she's not ready to see you.

15:01.817 --> 15:04.153
So what you're doing
to my family is abuse.

15:07.197 --> 15:10.826
I heard last year that Taerim High School
would turn into a high school of arts.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.162
I heard working at Taerim
would increase my chance

15:13.245 --> 15:15.289
at getting a job at an arts high school.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.958
So I gave up on the full-time position
and came to Taerim.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.210
I had no ulterior motive.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.047
So

15:24.256 --> 15:25.674
you want me to believe you?

15:27.384 --> 15:30.888
What should I do to make you believe me?
Should I lie?

15:34.600 --> 15:35.726
Ma'am.

15:37.394 --> 15:40.397
-Hello.
-Hello.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.399
-Thank you. Bye.
-Bye.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.943
My teacher said I did well!

15:46.153 --> 15:47.363
Get in the car.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.041
You can keep denying all you want,

15:59.124 --> 16:02.127
but I think you're deliberately
hanging around my family.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.298
I hope I'm worried for nothing.

16:28.862 --> 16:29.905
Ho-su.

16:35.244 --> 16:39.289
Ho-su, I told you
not to be friendly with strangers.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.250
She's not a stranger.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.712
What do you mean?

16:45.295 --> 16:47.047
Ho-su, it's time for your snack.

16:52.302 --> 16:53.595
Ho-su.

16:56.765 --> 16:57.933
Were you home?

16:59.643 --> 17:01.020
When did you come home?

17:01.103 --> 17:03.188
A while ago. I was tired.

17:34.928 --> 17:38.432
<i>Did you talk to your ex? What did he say?</i>

18:14.343 --> 18:15.427
May I help you?

18:17.137 --> 18:18.931
I'm here to pick up my stuff.

18:19.014 --> 18:21.225
I had to wait until the students left.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.859
Teachers mediate when kids fight.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.404
-Pardon?
-You told Ju-yeong

18:35.405 --> 18:37.366
not to put up with Li-sa.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.575
Oh, that?

18:39.326 --> 18:40.494
I did.

18:41.578 --> 18:44.957
Since they weren't foolish enough
to fight in front of me,

18:45.040 --> 18:46.750
I never got the chance to stop them.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.502
So you didn't even see them fight,

18:48.585 --> 18:50.671
but you made that decision
after talking to Ju-yeong?

18:52.005 --> 18:54.299
What you see isn't everything.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.096
Don't be fooled, Mr. An.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.936
If you underestimate kids,

19:06.436 --> 19:09.273
you might find yourself
in trouble beyond your imagination.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.154
You make it sound like
Li-sa did something wrong.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.364
What is it that you know?

19:19.908 --> 19:22.786
Li-sa and Ju-yeong
didn't tell me anything alarming.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.289
Of course not.

19:25.372 --> 19:28.125
Girls at that age don't trust their dads.

19:32.379 --> 19:33.589
Right.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.383
Ju-yeong told me

19:37.551 --> 19:40.679
that you seemed like a great guy.

19:41.638 --> 19:44.892
But I don't trust people who give off

19:45.851 --> 19:47.102
such an impression.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.022
Because people like that usually

19:50.772 --> 19:52.482
come with disgusting caveats.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.327
NOTICE OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION

20:07.122 --> 20:09.208
TAERIM GIRLS' MIDDLE SCHOOL,
TEACHER GU HAE-WON

20:09.291 --> 20:12.419
THE TEACHER IS TO BE DISMISSED
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, AN HYEON-SEONG

20:12.502 --> 20:15.714
It hasn't been finalized yet.
How did you get this?

20:15.797 --> 20:19.009
Right? Someone who was
worried about the school

20:19.092 --> 20:22.054
gave me a heads-up
about the possible mishap.

20:22.763 --> 20:23.805
Who?

20:24.473 --> 20:27.768
That's not the point.
Don't you think this is a cowardly move?

20:27.851 --> 20:29.728
Ms. Gu. Watch your tongue.

20:29.811 --> 20:34.024
I will face the punishment
for what I did to Li-sa.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.735
But I will not let you violate

20:36.818 --> 20:39.613
my rights as a teacher
and diminish the quality of my class.

20:39.696 --> 20:40.948
And what if you won't?

20:45.202 --> 20:46.536
<i>Have you ever tried avoiding a dog?</i>

20:47.955 --> 20:50.624
If you run, it chases after you even more.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.419
I hope you will make a wise decision.

21:12.854 --> 21:16.483
<i>His wife showed up
after several years and took him?</i>

21:19.987 --> 21:22.030
And Ms. Gu's immigration records?

21:22.656 --> 21:24.866
She was in Korea when his wife showed up.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.869
So this piece of paper was all it took?

21:30.622 --> 21:33.125
The hospital didn't even check up on it?

21:38.380 --> 21:41.049
DIRECTOR AN HYEON-SEONG

21:48.098 --> 21:49.808
We must find him then.

21:49.891 --> 21:50.892
Yes, sir.

21:51.476 --> 21:55.355
Look everywhere we can
around Gu Hae-won first.

21:57.816 --> 21:58.942
Find him.

22:40.567 --> 22:43.612
JEONG HUI-JU'S SOLO INVITATIONAL EXHIBIT

22:43.695 --> 22:46.239
REVISED: <i>FANTASY I</i>
COMPLETED: <i>LI-SA I</i>, <i>LI-SA II</i>

23:01.129 --> 23:02.798
I'm sorry to call you this late.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.218
But you left behind a painting.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.459
I feel like I'm dreaming.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.087
<i>You are.</i>

23:44.464 --> 23:46.341
I don't care if it's just a dream.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.885
I just don't want to wake up from it.

23:54.641 --> 23:55.767
<i>A nightmare is over</i>

23:56.768 --> 23:58.103
<i>once I wake up.</i>

24:19.791 --> 24:21.084
Li-sa.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.170
I'm off to my lesson.

24:23.753 --> 24:26.006
Already? Do you think you'll be okay?

24:26.089 --> 24:28.008
The competition is around the corner.

24:28.091 --> 24:29.759
I already wasted enough time.

24:29.843 --> 24:30.886
Yesterday…

24:31.678 --> 24:32.762
What about yesterday?

25:21.895 --> 25:24.856
Who comes unannounced that early?
You should've called.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.316
Sleep some more.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.986
I came because
I heard you were worried about me.

25:30.070 --> 25:33.573
If that was the case,
you could have just called me.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.494
Since you're here,
have some food before you go.

25:38.495 --> 25:42.249
When the weather is cold,
radishes are good for your health.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.336
I'll braise them with anchovies.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.129
Keep chopping them.

25:49.005 --> 25:50.006
What?

25:51.967 --> 25:54.719
I like listening to the sound
of you chopping radishes.

25:56.179 --> 25:57.722
What a silly thing to like.

25:59.641 --> 26:02.978
I like it. It makes me feel safe.

26:03.645 --> 26:04.729
I like it.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.694
Come visit me whenever things get tough.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.990
I can chop up
all the radishes in the world for you.

26:29.296 --> 26:33.717
Since when did my hospital
have a partner in Ireland?

26:35.427 --> 26:38.096
Where's Ireland, by the way?

26:43.310 --> 26:44.311
Did you approve this?

26:45.312 --> 26:46.187
Yes.

26:47.814 --> 26:49.149
How many years has it been?

26:49.774 --> 26:51.860
Why invest in this, instead of the school?

26:51.943 --> 26:53.194
It won't be a waste.

26:54.112 --> 26:57.073
Even if the school has leftover endowments
after the expenditure,

26:57.157 --> 26:59.868
you know that
we can't use that money to reinvest.

26:59.951 --> 27:02.412
And I don't want to buy land
like the other schools.

27:03.496 --> 27:04.414
And?

27:04.497 --> 27:06.499
The general hospital coming into Sejong

27:06.583 --> 27:09.669
will start a joint curriculum
with Trinity University in Ireland.

27:09.753 --> 27:13.757
And Korean pharmaceuticals started
to manufacture their products in Ireland.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.384
Taerim doesn't have a partner abroad yet,

27:16.468 --> 27:18.595
so I thought
this would be favorable for us.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.598
Is he telling the truth?

27:22.974 --> 27:24.684
Among English-speaking countries,

27:24.768 --> 27:27.562
it's the only hospital
without a partner in Korea.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.733
Why didn't you tell me
if this was a good deal?

27:31.816 --> 27:33.276
I was going to tell you

27:34.194 --> 27:35.653
once we started making profit.

27:36.237 --> 27:37.989
How and when did you set this up?

27:48.208 --> 27:49.459
It's been a while.

27:51.836 --> 27:53.213
I postponed a meeting for you.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.173
I'll get going now.

28:05.266 --> 28:07.477
I doubt that he came up with this alone.

28:08.311 --> 28:10.230
I bet Hui-ju had something to do with it.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.150
Check everything from A to Z.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.821
A recommendation
from another artist will go here.

28:18.321 --> 28:20.448
We'll list your past exhibitions here.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.660
You can write the explanations
for your pieces yourself,

28:23.743 --> 28:27.122
or we can invite a critic
to write something for your pieces.

28:31.126 --> 28:34.796
That exhibition seems to have
the director's attention.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.172
Right.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.508
Our slots were
already filled for the year.

28:38.591 --> 28:41.052
But she invited the artist
for a pop-up exhibition.

28:41.136 --> 28:43.221
We just do what she tells us to do.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.351
-As for the price range…
-Yes.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.603
This is the number
we have in mind per piece.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.112
EXHIBITION UNDER PREPARATION

30:13.478 --> 30:14.854
She looks like you.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.566
Hello.

30:18.650 --> 30:22.946
It really does give off
the impression of you.

30:24.697 --> 30:25.990
I'm still torn.

30:26.074 --> 30:28.201
This piece doesn't suit the overall theme

30:28.827 --> 30:31.371
or show the artist's style,
but I'm drawn to it.

30:32.455 --> 30:34.415
Of all the works,
this is the only portrait.

30:36.209 --> 30:37.877
It must be someone they liked.

30:38.419 --> 30:42.382
Maybe it's the angle, but it's like
the artist is secretly peeking at her.

30:42.465 --> 30:44.884
I can feel the love from the artist.

30:46.386 --> 30:50.056
Who's the artist?
I heard that you handpicked them.

30:50.765 --> 30:54.561
You wouldn't know even if I told you.
At least not yet.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.646
Right. Why don't you come?

30:56.729 --> 30:58.857
I'll introduce you during the reception.

30:58.940 --> 31:01.651
Sure. Thank you.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.803
Thank you, Hui-ju.

31:29.387 --> 31:32.682
Without a car, I even thought
about borrowing a cart to the post office.

31:35.018 --> 31:37.478
You've been drawing here the whole time?

31:38.062 --> 31:40.189
Can you even focus here?

31:40.940 --> 31:42.483
It's my friend's studio.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.111
This place is really good
compared to the one at school.

31:45.194 --> 31:47.405
The school studio stinks and is dusty.

31:47.488 --> 31:50.325
Some even pee there because
walking to the toilet is a hassle.

31:56.664 --> 31:58.833
I got it. It's mine, so I should do it.

32:19.103 --> 32:21.147
They look so lonely.

32:21.230 --> 32:24.943
-Pardon?
-I mean, why didn't you draw faces?

32:25.735 --> 32:28.446
Oh, those? Those are my friend's works.

32:28.529 --> 32:30.114
He doesn't draw faces.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.574
Why not?

32:31.658 --> 32:33.701
He only draws what he considers real,

32:33.785 --> 32:35.745
but he doesn't feel that way
towards people.

32:35.828 --> 32:37.121
Really?

33:23.209 --> 33:26.379
Don't erase it. Start from here again.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.007
It'll be yours even if it's bad.

33:31.217 --> 33:35.138
But how much longer
do I have to draw the same thing?

33:35.847 --> 33:38.891
Until you can draw
the same object differently.

33:42.770 --> 33:46.274
I'm not doing this to pass some exam.
I've been doing the same thing for days.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.495
Can't we wrap up here today?

36:16.299 --> 36:19.093
You left this behind last time.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.305
Okay. You can start now.

37:37.004 --> 37:38.005
Goodness.

37:39.840 --> 37:40.967
Sorry.

37:42.551 --> 37:44.053
I was thirsty, so…

37:47.890 --> 37:49.684
Your left side is prettier.

37:50.851 --> 37:51.894
Pardon?

37:53.437 --> 37:54.647
I mean, your face.

37:55.648 --> 37:59.110
And the curve from your forehead,
cheekbone, and chin.

38:01.737 --> 38:04.407
You say that as if it was nothing.

38:07.493 --> 38:10.663
That's not true.
I had to muster up the courage to say it.

40:03.943 --> 40:04.902
We meet again.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.617
The confessional is closed for the day.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.081
I thought about giving it a try today.

40:17.164 --> 40:18.707
Did you do something wrong?

40:19.834 --> 40:21.293
I was just curious

40:22.378 --> 40:26.215
if God would forgive me for the sins
I would commit in the future.

40:29.969 --> 40:32.346
That won't be possible, will it?

40:33.764 --> 40:35.516
Then you can just not do it.

40:37.852 --> 40:39.228
What are you planning to do?

40:41.480 --> 40:42.857
That's a secret.

41:04.545 --> 41:06.589
What are you doing here at this hour?

41:07.381 --> 41:08.674
Are you here to pray?

41:10.009 --> 41:11.427
I was waiting for you.

41:12.636 --> 41:14.054
In case you showed up.

41:15.639 --> 41:16.599
Me?

41:17.892 --> 41:18.893
Yes.

41:21.687 --> 41:22.938
Well…

41:24.190 --> 41:25.441
Li-sa…

41:28.068 --> 41:29.195
She's my niece.

41:32.448 --> 41:33.657
I see.

41:34.325 --> 41:35.159
I have a question.

41:37.119 --> 41:38.913
From what I've seen,

41:38.996 --> 41:42.082
you're not the type to get emotional
and hit a student for no reason.

41:45.127 --> 41:48.881
If I say you're right,
it'll only paint Li-sa in a bad light.

41:50.132 --> 41:53.552
And if I say you're wrong,
it will make me look really awful.

41:54.970 --> 41:56.639
But I was awful.

41:58.015 --> 41:59.433
Whatever the reason was,

41:59.517 --> 42:02.728
I did get emotional when I hit Li-sa.

42:06.106 --> 42:08.067
So I'm in the process of apologizing.

42:09.109 --> 42:10.569
And I will keep trying.

42:12.154 --> 42:14.698
I'm not sure if she'll forgive me though.

42:17.535 --> 42:18.786
You should.

42:19.703 --> 42:22.081
Apologize to her when you have the chance.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.669
Not being able to apologize

42:27.503 --> 42:30.631
is harder than not being forgiven.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.639
It's been shaking the whole time.

42:40.516 --> 42:43.852
I think it's a muscle spasm
due to anxiety. Come in for treatment.

42:55.322 --> 42:56.824
You know what today is, right?

42:58.200 --> 43:00.035
-Yes.
-Let's go.

43:13.048 --> 43:14.800
I'd like those pears. How much is it?

43:14.883 --> 43:15.926
It's 10,000 won.

44:03.349 --> 44:05.184
You have to live

44:06.226 --> 44:09.313
a good life for Jeong-seop's sake.

44:11.190 --> 44:12.399
Okay?

44:25.537 --> 44:27.498
While I was going through the closet,

44:28.082 --> 44:31.543
I found a shirt I bought
for him to wear when he woke up.

44:32.586 --> 44:34.213
I want you to wear it instead.

44:34.296 --> 44:38.092
You guys used to share clothes.
Your size hasn't changed, right?

44:41.845 --> 44:42.971
Thank you.

44:48.727 --> 44:50.145
Have some more rice.

45:06.787 --> 45:07.955
<i>Right.</i>

45:08.997 --> 45:11.125
I know how Hui-ju feels.

45:11.875 --> 45:14.378
She can't gloss over it
after what happened to Li-sa.

45:15.129 --> 45:17.464
The disciplinary committee
will make a decision

45:17.965 --> 45:20.050
by the end of today.

45:29.268 --> 45:30.269
Was I too loud?

45:30.352 --> 45:34.648
No. It's just that I have
a lot to go over today.

45:36.525 --> 45:40.904
Don't just sit at the desk all day.
Get some exercise.

45:40.988 --> 45:42.281
Exercise.

45:43.615 --> 45:47.786
And I told you multiple times
we should use honorifics with each other.

45:48.704 --> 45:51.707
That's cringey. It's not like
we have a big age gap.

45:55.377 --> 45:56.545
I insist.

45:59.006 --> 46:00.716
If we're loose with our words,

46:01.800 --> 46:03.552
our actions will soon follow.

46:23.238 --> 46:25.324
Open up your chest.

46:25.866 --> 46:27.576
That's it.

46:46.428 --> 46:49.223
Okay. Keep looking forward.

46:49.890 --> 46:52.267
You have more muscles than me.
You're flexible too.

46:52.935 --> 46:55.103
I don't want to do it,
but I'm forcing myself.

46:55.812 --> 46:57.314
You can lower it.

46:57.397 --> 46:58.732
Slowly.

47:00.901 --> 47:02.110
You can get up now.

47:03.278 --> 47:07.574
I mean, I'm exercising to survive.
That's all.

47:08.450 --> 47:10.869
The final products of art are beautiful.

47:10.953 --> 47:14.206
But the process of getting there
is like doing manual labor.

47:14.289 --> 47:16.124
Sounds similar to exercising.

47:16.792 --> 47:18.835
-Let's take a break.
-Okay.

47:30.264 --> 47:32.391
MOTHER

47:42.401 --> 47:45.487
Why did you invite her?
She rarely wears these kind of clothes.

47:46.113 --> 47:48.323
Then you should lose weight.

47:49.366 --> 47:52.578
She's a nice trophy to drag around
when we go shopping.

47:57.416 --> 48:01.211
She makes good clothes,
but she gossips too much.

48:01.795 --> 48:04.006
-We're done.
-Thank you.

48:06.174 --> 48:07.217
This way, please.

48:16.226 --> 48:17.978
Keep the measurements tight.

48:18.061 --> 48:21.064
She didn't use to be such a wreck.
She's been gaining weight lately.

48:24.359 --> 48:27.237
Did you check what I sent you?
The school looks good, right?

48:28.697 --> 48:32.242
Yes, it does.
But Ho-su is still very young.

48:32.326 --> 48:34.703
So he won't know what a privilege that is.

48:35.662 --> 48:38.040
He should to go
a normal school just like--

48:38.123 --> 48:39.374
What are you saying?

48:39.958 --> 48:44.129
Hey, how could you be so naive
in this day and age?

48:44.630 --> 48:47.966
A normal school?
Do you think everyone is equal?

48:48.050 --> 48:50.719
He was born into a different class.
Why throw that away?

48:53.847 --> 48:56.391
If he wants to go there,
I'll think about it.

48:57.476 --> 49:00.562
Jeong-hwan said
he wanted to go abroad first.

49:01.813 --> 49:05.525
He must be educated properly
to be able to recognize good values.

49:05.609 --> 49:08.654
The quality of their lives
will depend on their upbringings.

49:09.237 --> 49:10.322
Look at Li-sa.

49:10.405 --> 49:12.741
She could've stayed in England.
But you brought her back--

49:12.824 --> 49:14.701
I heard Li-sa changed her major again.

49:14.785 --> 49:16.411
How dare you cut me off.

49:17.329 --> 49:20.832
Turning the school into a school of arts
just for Li-sa is too much.

49:22.626 --> 49:26.171
It was already decided
before Li-sa came back to Korea.

49:26.254 --> 49:27.923
You know that.

49:28.006 --> 49:31.885
Right. I know that you have
Hyeon-seong wrapped around your finger.

49:32.636 --> 49:35.931
Even so, she should still study.
People might look down on her.

49:36.598 --> 49:40.435
I don't think studying is for everyone.
Not everyone can get--

49:40.519 --> 49:42.562
She should study for her own good.

49:42.646 --> 49:44.064
That's enough.

49:44.147 --> 49:46.858
Getting good grades
doesn't guarantee success.

49:46.942 --> 49:49.611
The best a doctor's son
can be is a doctor.

49:49.695 --> 49:51.655
I already have a hospital full of them.

49:52.572 --> 49:54.991
Look at her. She's a high school graduate.

49:55.575 --> 49:59.162
But she can talk back to me
because she married my son.

50:01.540 --> 50:02.374
Ma'am.

50:02.958 --> 50:06.086
You are the first client
I'm showing our new line.

50:06.169 --> 50:07.713
-Good.
-Feel the fabric.

50:30.819 --> 50:31.820
Are you all right?

50:33.655 --> 50:34.489
Delete that.

50:38.076 --> 50:39.327
Delete it.

50:45.083 --> 50:46.543
Are you okay, Li-sa?

50:50.130 --> 50:51.798
Gosh.

50:53.258 --> 50:55.552
You're Ju-yeong, right?

50:55.635 --> 50:57.095
Where do you live?

51:03.268 --> 51:06.271
Does your leg hurt a lot?
Should I ask your uncle to take a look?

51:07.272 --> 51:08.190
I'm fine.

51:08.690 --> 51:10.484
The competition is next month.

51:10.567 --> 51:12.277
I'll do something else if I can't.

51:12.360 --> 51:14.613
You already changed it three times.

51:14.696 --> 51:16.615
You should try the best you can.

51:16.698 --> 51:18.450
Li-sa is good at drawing too.

51:21.620 --> 51:24.247
I heard you were
aspiring to be a director.

51:24.331 --> 51:26.708
Yes. I'll apply
to Taerim High School of Arts too.

51:26.792 --> 51:28.251
For photography and video.

51:28.335 --> 51:31.505
I'm filming Li-sa preparing
for her performance test for my portfolio.

51:31.588 --> 51:33.590
You won't get extra points for filming me.

51:33.673 --> 51:35.592
Other kids' portfolios will be so boring.

51:35.675 --> 51:38.678
I'll film someone people want to watch.
And that's you.

51:39.679 --> 51:42.349
You must be happy
to have found your passion early on.

51:42.432 --> 51:45.060
I didn't know
what I wanted to do up until last year.

51:45.143 --> 51:46.394
But Mimi helped me.

51:47.604 --> 51:49.648
She said people like me
should eliminate my options first

51:49.731 --> 51:51.233
before finding my passion.

51:52.609 --> 51:53.735
Eliminate your options?

51:53.819 --> 51:54.653
Yes.

51:55.779 --> 51:58.990
I eliminated the things
I couldn't do even if I wanted to.

51:59.950 --> 52:03.036
And then I eliminated
the things I could do but didn't want to.

52:04.871 --> 52:06.581
And I ended up with only this.

52:06.665 --> 52:08.583
I tried it but as Ms. Gu said--

52:08.667 --> 52:10.502
Are you nuts? Do you have a death wish?

52:15.340 --> 52:16.508
Li-sa!

52:34.526 --> 52:36.152
I'll buy you the same phone.

52:36.236 --> 52:37.779
This model's been discontinued.

52:39.155 --> 52:42.993
Any model on the market will do.
They're all better than this.

52:43.076 --> 52:46.288
Okay. I'll call you as soon
as I find a decent one.

52:46.872 --> 52:48.081
Thank you.

52:48.164 --> 52:49.916
I'm sorry. Wait.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.379
I think Li-sa is being sensitive
because she hurt her leg.

52:54.462 --> 52:55.505
Please take a cab.

52:56.089 --> 52:59.217
I'm okay. It's because
I brought up Mimi first.

53:01.011 --> 53:02.846
To me, she was a really good teacher.

53:18.778 --> 53:20.906
You're grounded unless it's for lessons.

53:22.198 --> 53:23.742
-Why?
-Do you have to ask?

53:23.825 --> 53:25.285
We didn't fight.

53:25.368 --> 53:28.330
She'll come crawling back to me tomorrow
because she needs me.

53:28.413 --> 53:29.664
Even so, she's your friend.

53:29.748 --> 53:31.791
I can be mean to her. It's okay.

53:31.875 --> 53:33.293
How can you say that?

53:33.376 --> 53:35.378
No one deserves to be treated like that.

53:35.462 --> 53:38.089
-She does! She doesn't have a mom!
-Li-sa!

53:52.646 --> 53:55.941
Because your wife assaulted the teacher,

53:56.024 --> 53:58.902
we can't suspend her
on the grounds of violence.

53:58.985 --> 54:02.697
With this cause, the disciplinary action
will be in her record for ten years.

54:02.781 --> 54:04.908
So she won't be able to teach anywhere.

54:04.991 --> 54:08.161
Of course, dismissing her
would damage her career the most.

54:08.244 --> 54:09.829
But if we take it that far,

54:09.913 --> 54:12.707
Ms. Gu might file an appeal
to review the case.

54:13.333 --> 54:15.126
If she does, it'll be a huge scandal.

54:16.753 --> 54:20.507
That's not the point.
Don't you think this is a cowardly move?

54:21.883 --> 54:24.135
<i>Someone who was worried about the school</i>

54:24.219 --> 54:27.806
<i>gave me a heads-up
about the possible mishap.</i>

54:29.933 --> 54:31.935
THE TEACHER IS TO BE DISMISSED

54:32.018 --> 54:34.980
I understand. You can all go now.

54:35.063 --> 54:36.898
We should take care of this right away

54:36.982 --> 54:40.819
so we can file for approval next month
and won't be held responsible.

54:41.736 --> 54:44.489
Since people might
misunderstand it as retaliation,

54:45.407 --> 54:46.950
it won't hurt to be careful.

54:50.870 --> 54:52.998
I'm sure Mr. An will review it thoroughly.

54:58.586 --> 55:00.547
Well, all right then.

55:20.233 --> 55:21.401
Did you come here alone?

55:24.154 --> 55:27.198
People come here to fish.
So you can't take home what you catch.

55:27.282 --> 55:29.534
And you can only cook food
at the snack bar.

55:30.118 --> 55:32.287
Put your trash here. And leave the bag.

55:32.370 --> 55:35.206
You need to pay 30,000 won upfront.
10,000 won is the deposit.

55:42.297 --> 55:43.506
First-timer?

55:44.174 --> 55:47.552
Yes. I heard fishing is good
for clearing your head.

55:47.635 --> 55:50.096
That's why a lot of people
come here alone.

55:50.180 --> 55:52.682
And more young people are starting
to fish these days.

55:52.766 --> 55:54.559
It must be those TV shows, right?

55:54.642 --> 55:56.811
It might be you, the kind owner.

55:58.229 --> 56:02.192
First-timers usually don't know
that I'm the owner here.

56:02.275 --> 56:04.694
They always look for
a husband that I don't even have.

56:04.778 --> 56:05.820
I see.

56:08.823 --> 56:10.492
This place is huge.

56:11.367 --> 56:13.620
It must be hard
to maintain this place alone.

56:13.703 --> 56:14.704
I guess.

56:16.498 --> 56:18.541
I'll let you have
your peace and quiet now.

56:18.625 --> 56:20.502
Let me know if you need anything.

56:52.700 --> 56:54.202
<i>Hello, Ms. Jeong.</i>

56:54.285 --> 56:57.539
<i>Ho-su's grandmother came
and picked him up just now.</i>

57:04.963 --> 57:08.883
<i>Thank you, Hui-ju. Thanks to you,
the incident at school will be sorted out.</i>

57:09.467 --> 57:13.138
<i>I'll be more careful,
so I don't make the same mistake again.</i>

57:13.221 --> 57:14.597
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

57:27.569 --> 57:29.195
<i>You've arrived at your destination.</i>

57:45.837 --> 57:47.088
I didn't know you called.

57:47.172 --> 57:49.632
My phone died
right after I sent you the text message.

57:50.884 --> 57:54.179
I was by the river today,
so I still feel a little chilly.

57:56.347 --> 57:59.851
Are you sure you don't want any?
The food here is really good.

58:04.814 --> 58:06.816
Thank you again, Hui-ju.

58:07.484 --> 58:09.903
-Thanks to you--
-It wasn't me.

58:11.321 --> 58:14.407
Whatever the school decided,
I had nothing to do with it.

58:16.743 --> 58:19.829
You might be a good teacher
to some students.

58:20.497 --> 58:22.749
But Li-sa and I feel
uncomfortable around you.

58:24.459 --> 58:26.377
-I--
-So…

58:28.213 --> 58:29.714
don't thank me.

58:31.549 --> 58:34.636
This will be the last time we meet.
So I wanted to tell you this in person,

58:35.220 --> 58:37.222
not over the phone.

58:40.308 --> 58:43.645
So that you won't get the wrong idea.

58:52.237 --> 58:54.739
I also had something
to tell you in person.

59:06.251 --> 59:07.752
It's about Woo-jae.

59:12.465 --> 59:16.302
He sends his regards to you.

59:47.500 --> 59:48.835
<i>What are you doing?</i>

59:50.962 --> 59:52.380
Why are you packing?

59:53.965 --> 59:56.426
-That's enough!
-Stop it.

59:56.509 --> 59:57.885
Stop it!

59:57.969 --> 59:59.220
Gosh.

1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:13.359
Are you out of your mind? Are you nuts?

1:00:13.443 --> 1:00:15.320
Stop acting like a fool.

1:00:16.613 --> 1:00:18.156
Am I the only fool here?

1:00:20.074 --> 1:00:21.284
No.

1:00:22.452 --> 1:00:23.494
No.

1:00:24.287 --> 1:00:25.788
So let's stop fighting.

1:00:26.873 --> 1:00:27.999
Give him to me.

1:00:28.958 --> 1:00:31.878
If you want to leave, leave on your own.
You can't take Ho-su.

1:00:33.379 --> 1:00:34.505
Seo Woo-jae!

1:01:19.342 --> 1:01:20.760
Woo-jae…

1:01:21.678 --> 1:01:23.680
really misses you.

1:02:11.561 --> 1:02:13.938
<i>Whenever I think of the good times
I've had with Woo-jae,</i>

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:17.859
<i>you were always there too.</i>

1:02:19.235 --> 1:02:21.195
We should get together some time.

1:02:21.696 --> 1:02:23.030
Bullshit.

1:02:23.114 --> 1:02:25.450
<i>I didn't know you were married.</i>

1:02:25.533 --> 1:02:27.201
<i>Is that a problem?</i>

1:02:27.285 --> 1:02:29.579
<i>We're on the same side after all.</i>

1:02:32.665 --> 1:02:34.292
<i>-Where is she?
-Who?</i>

1:02:35.209 --> 1:02:36.669
Where the hell is she?

1:02:39.422 --> 1:02:40.798
<i>I'm going to forgive him.</i>

1:02:41.466 --> 1:02:43.301
<i>Because Woo-jae…</i>

1:02:44.427 --> 1:02:45.762
<i>came back.</i>

1:02:46.345 --> 1:02:48.431
<i>I'm late, aren't I?</i>

1:02:48.514 --> 1:02:53.519
