00:36.640 --> 00:38.141
We're here.

00:38.175 --> 00:40.043
Years from now, the world will realize

00:40.077 --> 00:42.412
that this is where
the future became possible.

00:42.446 --> 00:44.481
Man will live on the moon.

00:44.514 --> 00:47.150
It'll be our rockets
that carry them there.

00:47.316 --> 00:49.234
And this...

00:50.487 --> 00:52.456
is where we're gonna build them.

01:03.666 --> 01:05.535
Oh, there's one of 'em now.

01:09.973 --> 01:11.407
It's irresponsible.

01:11.441 --> 01:12.751
They didn't even know
what they were doing,

01:12.775 --> 01:14.777
and then boom.

01:31.166 --> 01:32.801
Morning, Professor.

01:32.882 --> 01:34.667
What are you all testing here today?

01:35.042 --> 01:36.911
Nothing that would interest you.

01:38.445 --> 01:42.290
We don't anticipate
any, uh, explosive findings.

01:47.698 --> 01:49.291
It's a shame, really.

01:49.316 --> 01:51.451
Such a waste of talent.

02:42.476 --> 02:45.012
Come on, faster.
Richard will be here soon.

02:48.449 --> 02:50.017
Come on.

02:55.302 --> 02:56.588
Hello?

03:15.342 --> 03:17.311
You still sure about this?

03:18.268 --> 03:20.581
Mesulam agreed to keep the
project under his supervision.

03:20.882 --> 03:23.517
Yeah, well, our last prototype
nearly took my foot off.

03:24.292 --> 03:26.897
He was the only one that
knew it was going to fail.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.079
Hey, Jack?

03:30.148 --> 03:32.550
Is that a busty redhead riding a wolf?

03:35.012 --> 03:37.414
It's a werewolf, actually.

03:43.180 --> 03:44.615
He's here.

03:48.630 --> 03:51.545
We were starting to worry
you weren't gonna show up.

03:51.723 --> 03:54.880
I stopped by campus to pick up
the last of our things.

03:54.966 --> 03:58.503
Richard, we got to stay focused
on what's in front of us.

04:00.307 --> 04:02.000
What do you think?

04:03.087 --> 04:04.890
It's a work in progress, I know,

04:04.915 --> 04:07.257
but we'll have everything
we had at GALCIT and more.

04:07.346 --> 04:10.383
We'll store chemicals over
here, put up some more tents.

04:10.622 --> 04:13.514
One for propellants,
one for engineering.

04:13.617 --> 04:16.820
And right there is where we're
gonna put our testing platform.

04:17.048 --> 04:21.153
The first dedicated rocketry
testing facility of its kind,

04:21.185 --> 04:24.990
or, as I like to call it, the JPROL.

04:25.023 --> 04:28.493
The Jack Parsons/Richard
Onsted Testing Laboratory.

04:28.527 --> 04:31.278
Oh, doesn't exactly
roll off the tongue, does it?

04:32.505 --> 04:35.359
Well, we could just drop
your name and call it JPL.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.616
I'm kidding.

04:39.777 --> 04:41.930
Your name can even come
first for all I care.

04:41.979 --> 04:43.477
The only thing that matters is

04:43.502 --> 04:44.863
that it's gonna be revolutionary,

04:44.888 --> 04:46.457
and it's gonna be ours.

04:48.081 --> 04:50.028
Can you picture it?

04:50.248 --> 04:53.218
Well, this place has
one thing going for it.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.526
At least here...

04:58.726 --> 05:01.259
no one will see us blow ourselves up.

05:09.509 --> 05:13.356
_

06:23.675 --> 06:26.278
Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit.

06:43.194 --> 06:45.397
Oh, is that the guy Parsons?

06:45.430 --> 06:46.798
Did you see the paper?

06:46.831 --> 06:49.067
I heard he almost blew himself up.

07:05.844 --> 07:07.812
I assume it's just alcohol in these?

07:07.966 --> 07:11.970
Absinthe made
by the Grand Magus himself.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.514
Not bad.

07:15.587 --> 07:17.729
Have you seen my pal Ernest around?

07:17.835 --> 07:20.805
First names must never be spoken.

07:27.327 --> 07:28.674
Good. You got a drink.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.567
Look like you could use it.

07:30.592 --> 07:34.062
Everybody, this is Frater J.P.,
a Minerval initiate.

07:34.232 --> 07:36.968
I remember him. Last time
he didn't come alone.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.653
- How - <i>is</i>
- Your wife?

07:38.690 --> 07:40.191
She's fine, thanks.

07:40.352 --> 07:41.937
Jack's wife is Catholic.

07:42.013 --> 07:44.616
Oh. My sympathies.

07:44.696 --> 07:46.420
I didn't realize you came to these?

07:47.047 --> 07:49.968
Well, it's important to Ernest,

07:50.514 --> 07:52.674
so, when in Rome...

07:52.732 --> 07:54.768
How many of those have you had?

08:01.078 --> 08:02.707
I'm glad you came.

08:02.798 --> 08:05.176
You tapped into your inner
potency out in the desert.

08:05.505 --> 08:07.779
Thelema can do the same thing for you.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.348
What exactly is Thelema?

08:12.129 --> 08:14.087
It's better experienced than explained.

08:14.223 --> 08:15.727
<i>Do what thou wilt</i>

08:15.752 --> 08:17.750
<i>shall be the whole of the law.</i>

08:19.684 --> 08:22.087
Love is the law.

08:22.527 --> 08:24.963
Love under will.

08:25.402 --> 08:27.732
I proclaim the Law of Light,

08:27.954 --> 08:33.471
Life, Love and Liberty
in the name of IAO.

08:33.683 --> 08:36.087
Love is the law.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.316
Love under will!

08:41.246 --> 08:44.282
Sing unto me the rapturous love song!

08:44.483 --> 08:46.758
Burn to me perfume!

08:46.925 --> 08:48.461
Wear to me jewels!

08:50.241 --> 08:51.796
Drink to me.

08:52.169 --> 08:54.493
I am the blue-lidded
daughter of sunset.

08:56.105 --> 08:57.740
I am the naked brilliance

08:58.096 --> 09:01.182
of the voluptuous... night sky.

09:02.826 --> 09:04.476
To me!

09:05.063 --> 09:06.545
To me!

09:06.874 --> 09:09.692
Love is the law.

09:09.755 --> 09:11.769
- Love under will.
- Love under will!

09:11.962 --> 09:14.147
Love is the law.

09:14.218 --> 09:16.220
Love under will.

09:39.624 --> 09:41.593
What happens now?

09:43.808 --> 09:45.843
Now you leave.

09:47.965 --> 09:51.436
You must ascend higher before
you can partake in the workings.

10:00.084 --> 10:03.153
Hey, you know what they're
doing up there now?

10:04.664 --> 10:06.404
What's this?

10:06.564 --> 10:09.100
The answers you seek.

10:36.034 --> 10:37.794
This is London.

10:37.888 --> 10:41.224
You will now hear a statement
by the prime minister.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.168
I am speaking to you

10:43.201 --> 10:46.638
from the cabinet room
of 10 Downing Street.

10:46.837 --> 10:50.608
This morning
the British ambassador in Berlin

10:50.842 --> 10:55.146
<i>handed the German government
a final note</i>

10:55.272 --> 11:00.211
<i>stating that, unless we heard
from them by 11:00,</i>

11:00.418 --> 11:02.770
<i>that they were prepared at once</i>

11:02.795 --> 11:04.997
<i>to withdraw their troops from Poland,</i>

11:05.490 --> 11:09.253
a state of war would exist between us.

11:09.746 --> 11:11.852
I have to tell you now

11:11.929 --> 11:15.366
that no such undertaking
has been received,

11:15.466 --> 11:17.035
<i>and that consequently</i>

11:17.377 --> 11:21.767
<i>this country is at war with Germany.</i>

11:22.127 --> 11:26.565
<i>You can imagine
what a bitter blow it is to me</i>

11:26.744 --> 11:30.114
<i>that all my long struggle
to win peace has failed.</i>

11:30.280 --> 11:31.672
<i>Yet I cannot believe</i>

11:31.697 --> 11:34.360
<i>that there is anything more
or anything different</i>

11:34.385 --> 11:35.807
<i>that I could have done</i>

11:35.860 --> 11:37.795
<i>and that would have been
more successful.</i>

11:38.389 --> 11:41.929
Up to the very last it would
have been quite possible

11:41.954 --> 11:45.024
to have arranged a peaceful
and honorable settlement

11:45.396 --> 11:48.726
between Germany and Poland.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.203
But Hitler would not have it.

11:56.070 --> 11:59.105
<i>Now may God bless you all</i>

11:59.551 --> 12:01.955
<i>and may He defend the right.</i>

12:03.246 --> 12:06.351
<i>For it is evil things that
we shall be fighting against,</i>

12:06.871 --> 12:09.497
<i>brute force, bad faith,</i>

12:09.761 --> 12:12.164
<i>injustice, oppression,</i>

12:12.743 --> 12:14.984
and persecution.

12:15.385 --> 12:19.397
And against them I am certain
that the right will prevail.

12:21.847 --> 12:23.735
You heard?

12:24.324 --> 12:26.468
Just now... in the truck.

12:26.543 --> 12:28.148
...with a solemn
statement declaring war...

12:28.172 --> 12:30.033
I can't believe it.

12:30.195 --> 12:32.055
Please stay tuned
for further developments.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.182
We now return you
to regular programming.

12:37.327 --> 12:39.363
Don't worry. Europe's a world away.

12:42.593 --> 12:44.595
Where were you?

12:45.269 --> 12:46.674
Uh, I'm sorry.

12:46.699 --> 12:49.954
I was trying to get the
generator going in the Arroyo.

12:50.667 --> 12:52.769
Lost track of time.

12:53.491 --> 12:56.027
Well, I'm glad you're here now.

13:34.550 --> 13:36.040
Lay back.

13:36.074 --> 13:37.858
What are you doing?

13:38.229 --> 13:40.520
Jack, what are you doing?

13:40.879 --> 13:42.948
Just trust me.

14:21.146 --> 14:22.553
Stop.

14:22.587 --> 14:26.643
St-Stop. I said stop.

14:36.714 --> 14:39.350
Why would you think I'd like that?

14:40.905 --> 14:43.608
Well, I didn't. It was disgusting.

14:45.883 --> 14:47.518
Fine.

14:48.893 --> 14:51.298
I guess I'm disgusting.

16:38.770 --> 16:41.332
Hop in. We're heading
to the same place.

16:42.613 --> 16:44.382
Did Jack invite you out here?

16:44.407 --> 16:45.988
Told me all about your project.

16:46.013 --> 16:48.149
Nothing gives people faith
in their endeavors

16:48.599 --> 16:50.968
like a sense of posterity.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.123
Well, come on. I don't have all day.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.675
<i>One of the advantages
of being out here</i>

16:57.700 --> 16:59.619
<i>is that we can run as
many tests as we like.</i>

16:59.641 --> 17:00.787
Which is why I've developed

17:00.812 --> 17:02.686
a state-of-the-art testing mechanism.

17:03.011 --> 17:04.214
Come on.

17:09.775 --> 17:11.309
Your neighbor gave me a lift.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.569
Apparently, we need a documentarian.

17:13.636 --> 17:15.707
Figured it might be helpful
to record the tests

17:15.732 --> 17:16.887
so you can watch 'em back later.

17:16.912 --> 17:18.780
That actually would be very helpful.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.507
Thank you, Ernest.

17:20.675 --> 17:21.821
We're not running any tests today,

17:21.847 --> 17:23.327
but maybe you can capture
the preparations.

17:24.338 --> 17:26.307
You just pretend I'm not here.

17:27.516 --> 17:29.652
Well, back to the job at hand.

17:30.017 --> 17:31.719
Here's what I'm proposing.

17:32.759 --> 17:35.318
We dig a trench out there

17:35.343 --> 17:37.625
and lay the test rocket sideways,

17:37.847 --> 17:39.628
attaching a recoil spring

17:39.662 --> 17:42.285
so that any misfires will have
a limited blast radius.

17:42.344 --> 17:45.981
Conversely, we could just stop
designing rockets that blow up.

17:47.708 --> 17:49.583
Well, the quicker we...

17:49.694 --> 17:50.909
eliminate bad ideas,

17:50.934 --> 17:52.428
the quicker we reach escape velocity.

17:52.453 --> 17:54.677
So we're just back
to trial and error then, huh?

17:54.702 --> 17:57.154
Think of it as destruction and rebirth.

17:57.179 --> 17:58.707
Exactly, he gets it.

17:58.807 --> 18:00.208
Don't point that thing at me.

18:02.433 --> 18:04.193
So...

18:04.800 --> 18:06.647
shall we get started?

18:09.024 --> 18:10.960
You want us to dig the trench?

18:10.993 --> 18:12.243
It's not gonna dig itself.

18:12.494 --> 18:14.606
The guy's a prophet. If he
tells you to do something,

18:14.630 --> 18:16.198
you just do it.

18:18.567 --> 18:19.868
Richard.

18:30.335 --> 18:31.696
Well, if he's not gonna bust his ass,

18:31.720 --> 18:33.822
I don't see why
the guy on crutches has to.

18:38.740 --> 18:41.376
Come on, Richard.
Are you gonna pitch in or not?

18:43.873 --> 18:45.374
Goddamn it.

18:47.792 --> 18:49.706
<i>In every part of the world,</i>

18:49.751 --> 18:53.691
<i>a fearsome anxiety
possesses the souls of men.</i>

18:54.411 --> 18:57.170
We therefore enjoin all men,

18:57.379 --> 19:00.272
as this ominous storm approaches,

19:00.651 --> 19:04.313
to make their way back
to the Prince of Peace,

19:05.281 --> 19:07.716
the Conqueror of Death,

19:08.504 --> 19:11.287
from Whom we have heard
the comforting words,

19:11.493 --> 19:14.456
"Peace be unto you."

19:14.988 --> 19:16.911
His peace

19:17.059 --> 19:19.461
which alone can calm

19:19.839 --> 19:22.667
and allay the fear and confusion

19:22.757 --> 19:24.838
in men's minds.

19:34.376 --> 19:36.545
God, it's like someone died.

19:40.775 --> 19:41.904
I'm just saying.

19:41.936 --> 19:44.066
It's not like we're in Poland.

19:44.499 --> 19:45.721
You wouldn't understand.

19:45.754 --> 19:47.756
You were born after the Great War.

19:50.057 --> 19:53.562
Were you listening
to Father Shelby's sermon?

19:54.081 --> 19:57.266
It may look like the dark clouds
are only gathering over Europe,

19:57.300 --> 19:59.168
but believe me,

19:59.467 --> 20:02.570
before too long,
the storm will blow in.

20:04.446 --> 20:06.548
Do you think Jack will have to enlist?

20:07.638 --> 20:08.932
Yeah, but knowing him,

20:08.957 --> 20:11.463
he'll figure a way to get out of it.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.744
I wouldn't wish
what I went through on anyone.

20:13.769 --> 20:15.304
Can I be excused?

20:16.645 --> 20:18.320
Do the dishes,
then straight to your room.

20:18.354 --> 20:19.555
But it's only 6:00.

20:19.588 --> 20:22.051
And you're grounded, remember?

20:23.617 --> 20:25.907
Don't make me ask you again.

20:40.069 --> 20:41.389
What did you do this time?

20:41.436 --> 20:43.338
You really want to know?

20:45.627 --> 20:47.896
Daddy caught me sneaking
out to meet Carl.

20:48.027 --> 20:49.785
The boy from Halloween?

20:49.868 --> 20:52.354
Daddy refuses to let me see
him, so what does he expect?

20:52.794 --> 20:55.376
Probably that you'll do as you're told.

20:59.096 --> 21:01.397
Virgil tried to get me
to stop seeing Jack.

21:01.830 --> 21:04.289
I obviously didn't listen, either.

21:04.602 --> 21:08.005
My older sister admitting
she's not perfect?

21:09.125 --> 21:10.672
You must really like this boy.

21:11.124 --> 21:12.408
He's okay.

21:12.467 --> 21:14.202
Though he's dumb as a stone.

21:15.797 --> 21:18.366
It's not like I'm planning
on marrying him or anything.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.142
Doesn't seem like it's worth

21:20.167 --> 21:21.969
getting into all this trouble, then.

21:22.217 --> 21:23.997
Oh, it is.

21:26.943 --> 21:28.704
What?

21:29.777 --> 21:31.399
You haven't...

21:31.506 --> 21:32.974
Haven't what?

21:35.696 --> 21:37.132
You know.

21:38.827 --> 21:40.195
Maybe.

21:40.947 --> 21:42.738
Spare me another sermon.

21:43.004 --> 21:45.049
I know what you're going to
say. That I'm too young,

21:45.074 --> 21:46.518
that I should be saving
myself for the right boy.

21:46.542 --> 21:47.876
Shh.

21:48.275 --> 21:49.470
You heard Daddy.

21:49.495 --> 21:51.664
With war coming, I may
never get another chance.

21:52.295 --> 21:53.882
- That's why?
- No.

21:54.043 --> 21:55.350
It just feels good.

21:55.384 --> 21:56.967
Why should I have to wait?

21:59.288 --> 22:01.208
Come on, you know what I mean.

22:01.290 --> 22:02.891
You and Jack must do it all the time.

22:02.916 --> 22:05.018
Isn't that the whole
point of getting married?

22:05.593 --> 22:07.200
Not the whole point.

22:07.289 --> 22:09.691
Okay. When you do, don't
you like how it feels?

22:11.947 --> 22:13.649
Whoa, what happened?

22:14.236 --> 22:16.332
I just don't want to
talk about this with you.

22:16.357 --> 22:17.659
You're the one that brought it up.

22:17.684 --> 22:18.906
Is everything all right?

22:19.013 --> 22:20.442
Yeah, it's fine, Daddy.

22:20.476 --> 22:22.677
Least she didn't break
one of the fancy ones.

22:35.247 --> 22:36.525
We need to talk.

22:36.558 --> 22:38.827
The point of knocking
is for someone to answer, but...

22:38.881 --> 22:40.734
What's going on with you?

22:42.287 --> 22:43.478
Out in the Arroyo,

22:43.503 --> 22:44.527
you couldn't care less about

22:44.552 --> 22:45.857
anything anyone was doing.

22:45.921 --> 22:48.023
Maybe I'm just camera-shy.

22:48.552 --> 22:50.439
Well, at least Ernest is helping.

22:50.585 --> 22:52.341
We've got too much work to do.

22:52.665 --> 22:54.849
There isn't time to sulk.

22:55.575 --> 22:56.945
You need to snap out of it.

22:57.361 --> 22:58.938
If not for me,
then for the rest of the team.

22:58.963 --> 23:00.356
Okay.

23:02.237 --> 23:03.919
Look, I get it.

23:04.161 --> 23:05.821
Your worst fear came true.

23:06.263 --> 23:07.582
You failed in front
of the whole campus.

23:07.606 --> 23:09.513
Thanks for spelling it out so clearly.

23:09.597 --> 23:12.467
My point is your worst fear
is behind you.

23:12.661 --> 23:14.878
You don't need to worry
about it anymore.

23:17.381 --> 23:19.268
Come on, we're the Suicide Club.

23:19.361 --> 23:21.231
Men who'd pay
the ultimate price for science.

23:21.289 --> 23:23.948
Or men who failed one time too many.

23:26.108 --> 23:27.728
- Jack.
- "Dear Professor von Braun,"

23:27.756 --> 23:28.787
"I hope you are well."

23:28.812 --> 23:29.834
- That's private.
- "With the gravity"

23:29.859 --> 23:31.451
"of recent events weighing on me,"

23:31.480 --> 23:33.450
"I find myself wondering
whether I can continue"

23:33.521 --> 23:37.392
"such frivolous-seeming pursuits."

23:37.712 --> 23:39.013
"Frivolous"?

23:40.802 --> 23:42.988
Are you talking about our project?

23:51.934 --> 23:54.087
When you're finished
feeling sorry for yourself,

23:54.241 --> 23:56.243
you know where to find me.

24:11.084 --> 24:13.654
Is he gonna be much longer?

24:29.658 --> 24:31.830
- Are you okay?
- What?

24:32.060 --> 24:34.996
Oh, yes. It's not what you think.

24:35.233 --> 24:36.645
Here.

24:37.433 --> 24:38.780
I've been purging.

24:42.372 --> 24:44.479
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:45.039 --> 24:46.474
No, keep it.

24:46.734 --> 24:48.624
Looks like you've got
more to purge than me.

24:57.390 --> 24:59.189
He's ready for you.

24:59.962 --> 25:01.386
Hope it goes well in there.

25:01.443 --> 25:02.927
I'll be fine.

25:10.525 --> 25:14.349
Frater E.D. tells me
you are a scientist

25:14.843 --> 25:18.520
designing ships intending
to take us all to the moon.

25:18.972 --> 25:22.409
It's no wonder you were drawn to Agape.

25:23.872 --> 25:26.641
You seek to leave this realm in body.

25:27.356 --> 25:29.088
We seek to transcend it

25:29.113 --> 25:30.448
in spirit.

25:30.799 --> 25:32.134
I guess.

25:32.167 --> 25:33.702
No, we don't guess.

25:33.735 --> 25:35.126
We seek to know.

25:35.151 --> 25:37.654
If we don't know,
we keep asking questions

25:37.679 --> 25:39.715
till we find the answer.

25:40.247 --> 25:42.844
Do you know why people don't
like having their picture taken?

25:43.485 --> 25:46.710
Because they're scared
of what they will see.

25:49.150 --> 25:52.679
What... is standing in the way

25:53.558 --> 25:56.024
of manifesting your dream?

25:56.670 --> 25:58.227
Plenty.

25:59.067 --> 26:01.236
My partner, for starters.

26:01.490 --> 26:03.892
Your frustration with him
is what brought you in today?

26:04.012 --> 26:05.546
Yes.

26:07.710 --> 26:09.871
He's starting to lose faith

26:10.280 --> 26:11.694
in our project

26:11.751 --> 26:13.561
because of one minor setback.

26:13.928 --> 26:15.408
Is he a jealous man?

26:16.278 --> 26:18.945
Great men cast even greater shadows.

26:19.014 --> 26:21.650
Must be hard for your partner
to live in yours.

26:23.464 --> 26:24.766
The setback wouldn't have happened

26:24.791 --> 26:26.369
if he'd just listened to me.

26:26.529 --> 26:28.173
Perhaps he's blaming the endeavor

26:28.198 --> 26:32.015
rather than admitting
these feelings of inferiority.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.168
And what about your wife?

26:34.233 --> 26:35.977
- What about her?
- You don't ask questions

26:36.002 --> 26:37.400
during the process.

26:38.190 --> 26:39.932
You brought her here
the first time you came.

26:39.994 --> 26:41.460
- Yeah.
- But she didn't come back.

26:41.485 --> 26:42.853
- No.
- Why not?

26:43.512 --> 26:45.141
I think what she saw scared her.

26:45.207 --> 26:47.362
- You think?
- I know.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.171
People that carry fear inside them

26:49.196 --> 26:50.330
spread that fear to others.

26:50.355 --> 26:52.272
Has she impeded your will?

26:53.673 --> 26:55.331
She's the only reason
I made it this far.

26:55.356 --> 26:56.624
She never doubts you?

26:56.652 --> 26:57.919
Not really, no.

26:58.324 --> 26:59.755
Never makes you feel guilty

26:59.788 --> 27:01.389
or you're not meeting your obligations?

27:01.414 --> 27:03.683
Never judges you?

27:03.838 --> 27:05.873
Does she make you feel desired?

27:07.145 --> 27:08.312
Master Crowley tells us

27:08.337 --> 27:11.407
that the greatest obstacle
in manifesting our will

27:12.366 --> 27:14.046
is sexual frustration.

27:14.126 --> 27:16.037
That's my wife you're talking about.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.215
Hi.

27:21.095 --> 27:23.239
You look great. Just...

27:24.079 --> 27:25.769
- There you go.
- Thanks.

27:26.081 --> 27:27.930
<i>Stitches may not show up on camera,</i>

27:27.955 --> 27:29.990
But they still have to be straight.

27:30.458 --> 27:32.994
Let's see. Hmm.

27:34.022 --> 27:36.132
Oh, hike up that hem.

27:36.204 --> 27:37.963
It's a comedy, not Sunday school.

27:37.988 --> 27:39.356
Okay.

27:39.467 --> 27:40.935
Afternoon, beautiful.

27:41.062 --> 27:42.655
What are you doing here?

27:43.075 --> 27:44.555
Well, I wanted to give
this back to you.

27:44.581 --> 27:46.018
Tell Phoebe I said thanks.

27:47.441 --> 27:49.204
Stop it.

27:49.374 --> 27:51.110
I will.

27:51.673 --> 27:53.311
You want me to ask her
to develop the film

27:53.336 --> 27:54.911
while I'm at it? Sure.

27:54.936 --> 27:56.966
Jack will be dying to see it.

27:58.239 --> 28:00.716
I sure hope he's appreciative.

28:01.116 --> 28:03.047
Quite a thing to ask you to...

28:03.534 --> 28:06.221
document his rocket test
and yet no pay.

28:06.246 --> 28:07.354
This is what we do

28:07.379 --> 28:09.138
for those who want to walk
their chosen path.

28:09.163 --> 28:11.031
We help them stay on it.

28:11.946 --> 28:13.581
What?

28:13.742 --> 28:15.811
Everyone take ten.

28:16.013 --> 28:17.874
I'm gonna show my hubby
what we've been working on.

28:17.899 --> 28:19.257
What's wrong?

28:19.913 --> 28:21.102
Nothing.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.720
It's just maybe we shouldn't talk

28:22.744 --> 28:24.346
about the Agape at my work.

28:24.639 --> 28:26.107
Why? You embarrassed?

28:26.239 --> 28:27.799
No.

28:28.143 --> 28:30.759
It's just the Grand Magus
said you should only speak of it

28:30.784 --> 28:32.319
to those who are ready to listen.

28:32.344 --> 28:33.712
The Grand Magus, huh?

28:33.737 --> 28:35.594
I didn't realize you were so devoted.

28:36.674 --> 28:38.186
Okay, you got me.

28:38.253 --> 28:40.788
That's not the only reason
I cleared the office.

28:43.197 --> 28:46.834
I haven't been able to stop
thinking about the other night.

28:47.135 --> 28:49.337
- Have you?
- No.

28:52.229 --> 28:56.137
I'm starting to understand, I think.

28:56.403 --> 29:00.140
It did feel sort of... magical.

29:01.232 --> 29:02.944
Didn't you like it?

29:03.104 --> 29:06.307
The point isn't whether
or not I Liked it.

29:08.316 --> 29:10.364
I'm trying, Ernest.

29:10.806 --> 29:12.574
What more do you want from me?

29:12.721 --> 29:14.153
It's not about what...

29:14.178 --> 29:15.778
What you want. I know.

29:15.957 --> 29:17.692
Jesus.

29:18.179 --> 29:20.195
But, I mean, isn't it?

29:21.716 --> 29:23.675
Do you still want me?

29:23.752 --> 29:26.054
Yes, I told you.

29:26.632 --> 29:29.255
But you also want...
all those other women.

29:29.280 --> 29:30.385
It's not about that.

29:30.410 --> 29:32.723
Each person is a different
shaped key that can...

29:34.016 --> 29:35.596
- open up a different part of us.
- Can you stop

29:35.621 --> 29:37.789
With the Thelema stuff for two seconds?

29:39.294 --> 29:40.534
Just tell me.

29:40.608 --> 29:42.183
How many other keys were you with

29:42.208 --> 29:43.936
while we were apart?

29:44.089 --> 29:46.288
You can be just as free
as me to explore.

29:47.528 --> 29:48.756
What if my true will

29:48.781 --> 29:51.751
is to be with you and only you?

29:55.021 --> 29:56.364
I'm sorry.

29:57.101 --> 29:58.776
Don't say that.

29:59.497 --> 30:00.684
At least not like that.

30:00.728 --> 30:01.850
What do you want me to say?

30:01.875 --> 30:03.963
Just promise me...

30:05.740 --> 30:07.569
Listen, please, I...

30:09.344 --> 30:11.065
...I can handle you exploring

30:11.090 --> 30:13.626
as long as I know
there's not someone else.

30:13.815 --> 30:15.455
Someone...

30:15.717 --> 30:17.966
someone you want more than me.

30:19.306 --> 30:20.834
There's no one else.

30:34.702 --> 30:37.238
Then cut through the side...

30:52.494 --> 30:54.095
Nifty trick.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.391
It's not a trick.

30:56.660 --> 30:58.920
In life, we all start out ill-formed.

30:58.980 --> 31:01.206
But the more people
grasp their true selves,

31:01.275 --> 31:03.110
the more they come into focus.

31:03.198 --> 31:05.612
Or you just changed the shutter speeds.

31:05.753 --> 31:07.200
The camera settings are identical.

31:07.225 --> 31:10.088
The only variable is the subject.

31:11.506 --> 31:14.915
The process reveals latent agitations.

31:15.395 --> 31:17.917
Invisible to the naked eye.

31:19.199 --> 31:21.335
Indelible on film.

31:27.755 --> 31:30.058
You have a rare clarity, Jack.

31:32.761 --> 31:36.433
Your struggle is not
discovering your true will.

31:36.458 --> 31:38.990
It's getting others to heed it.

31:40.634 --> 31:42.391
You can say that again.

31:42.603 --> 31:44.208
To restore your friend's faith,

31:44.325 --> 31:47.757
we must help him recapture the passion

31:47.782 --> 31:50.531
that once ignited his ambitions.

31:51.925 --> 31:53.435
How do I do that?

31:53.488 --> 31:55.323
Well, fortunately,
you are no longer alone

31:55.348 --> 31:57.562
in figuring that out.

31:59.152 --> 32:01.088
As for your wife,

32:01.863 --> 32:04.138
place this under your bed.

32:08.522 --> 32:12.159
Before long, you'll notice a change.

32:13.034 --> 32:14.984
What, like a...

32:15.915 --> 32:17.185
like a magic potion?

32:18.390 --> 32:19.496
You are a scientist.

32:19.533 --> 32:21.535
I don't expect you
to take my word for it.

32:22.860 --> 32:24.640
Put it to the test.

32:25.099 --> 32:28.122
See if you observe any results.

33:11.705 --> 33:12.785
Jack? What are you doing?

33:12.810 --> 33:13.993
Uh, found them.

33:15.114 --> 33:16.560
You're going out?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.909
There's a meeting of the
Science Fantasy Society tonight.

33:20.175 --> 33:21.869
I'm taking Richard.

33:23.490 --> 33:25.392
Haven't been
to one of those in a while.

33:26.491 --> 33:27.833
What's the book?

33:27.966 --> 33:30.641
It's a werewolf story called <i>
Darker Than You Think.</i>

33:30.701 --> 33:32.054
Some title.

33:32.112 --> 33:34.557
Hopefully, just being in that
room will remind Richard

33:34.582 --> 33:37.239
why we started all this
stuff in the first place.

33:37.357 --> 33:39.359
Reignite his passions, you know?

33:42.686 --> 33:43.686
Are we ever going to talk

33:43.711 --> 33:45.913
about what happened the other night?

33:49.416 --> 33:51.007
What's there to talk about?

33:51.390 --> 33:54.402
You made your feelings pretty clear.

33:54.908 --> 33:57.077
I'm sorry for what I said.

33:59.866 --> 34:02.210
Don't be. I get it.

34:02.766 --> 34:04.279
What do you get?

34:05.031 --> 34:06.581
I don't know what came over me.

34:07.148 --> 34:09.050
I don't know why, I-it...

34:09.745 --> 34:11.286
it just felt strange.

34:12.760 --> 34:13.955
I understand.

34:13.987 --> 34:15.155
Listen, I got to go,

34:15.179 --> 34:17.014
but these things don't run very late.

34:17.478 --> 34:19.813
Maybe we can make up
for it when I get home.

34:22.971 --> 34:24.505
I'd like that.

34:33.708 --> 34:36.953
<i>"He was free and swift and strong.</i>"

34:37.434 --> 34:40.447
"He wanted to explore
this new existence,

34:40.661 --> 34:43.495
to find his powers and their bounds."

34:43.831 --> 34:46.266
Did you get to the end?

34:46.685 --> 34:48.489
- It's even better than
- <i>The Cometeers.</i>

34:48.523 --> 34:51.029
He's a poor man's
Edgar Burroughs at best.

34:51.054 --> 34:52.056
"Her white fangs"

34:52.081 --> 34:53.496
"flashed in scorn."

34:53.522 --> 34:56.091
"'Our enemies are men.'"

35:02.388 --> 35:05.057
Y-You're far too kind.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.591
Now, if anyone has any questions.

35:08.343 --> 35:09.493
Yes, you there.

35:09.589 --> 35:10.695
I loved it,

35:10.720 --> 35:13.132
but was a little confused by one thing.

35:13.372 --> 35:16.155
Did that woman turn
that guy into a wolf?

35:16.180 --> 35:19.341
Or was he a wolf already,
just trapped in a man's body?

35:19.474 --> 35:22.010
April is very much a Freudian
image of the id,

35:22.752 --> 35:25.159
leading Barbee into the darker side

35:25.193 --> 35:27.061
of his desires and instincts.

35:27.515 --> 35:29.631
In a sense, the wolf
was always inside Barbee.

35:31.439 --> 35:33.468
<i>As it is in all of us.</i>

37:23.931 --> 37:26.614
What the hell are you doing here?

37:27.604 --> 37:29.304
One piece, please.

37:29.463 --> 37:30.904
I'm following my true path.

37:30.957 --> 37:32.133
Shh.

37:34.727 --> 37:36.792
I want to move up a degree,
but the Magus says

37:36.817 --> 37:39.694
I need to practice my workings
out in the world.

37:40.166 --> 37:42.068
Practice on who?

37:45.600 --> 37:47.835
You better not say anything to him.

37:48.004 --> 37:49.940
I'm not here to spill secrets.

37:50.211 --> 37:52.695
I'm here to restore
your friend's faith.

37:53.940 --> 37:55.362
How?

38:00.233 --> 38:03.440
It's a shame Ackerman
or Doc Smith didn't talk.

38:03.940 --> 38:06.653
Someone to feed our inspiration.

38:08.320 --> 38:09.922
You disagree?

38:11.873 --> 38:14.137
You said you wanted to take
my mind off our project,

38:14.162 --> 38:16.698
but that is exactly why
we're here, isn't it?

38:16.831 --> 38:18.251
No, we're here to remind you

38:18.276 --> 38:20.312
that we were friends
before we were partners.

38:21.726 --> 38:23.924
The first time we read Smith,
we stayed up all night,

38:23.949 --> 38:25.406
and created our own Skylark

38:25.431 --> 38:26.848
to carry us across the universe.

38:26.873 --> 38:28.413
We were 17.

38:28.543 --> 38:30.198
And I've learned the
difference between science

38:30.223 --> 38:32.243
and science fiction since then.

38:35.762 --> 38:37.669
This seat taken?

38:40.561 --> 38:42.122
I'm Marisol.

38:42.509 --> 38:44.076
I'm Jack.

38:45.173 --> 38:46.427
And you?

38:47.126 --> 38:48.734
Richard.

38:49.197 --> 38:50.898
Eh, Rich.

38:51.695 --> 38:53.726
Okay, Rich.

38:54.202 --> 38:56.020
Did you boys enjoy the reading?

38:56.076 --> 38:57.511
I'm a huge fan of Williamson's.

38:57.557 --> 38:59.993
His work draws a lot from
eastern esoteric thought.

39:00.274 --> 39:01.742
Wow, those are big words.

39:02.374 --> 39:04.212
It's an area of personal interest.

39:04.696 --> 39:05.947
What about you?

39:06.016 --> 39:08.363
What do you boys get up to
when you're not at Clifton's?

39:09.463 --> 39:11.031
Well, believe it or not,

39:11.219 --> 39:13.554
we run the rocketry team at Caltech.

39:13.898 --> 39:15.824
- No kidding.
- Mm-hmm.

39:15.957 --> 39:18.321
If I knew you could study
spaceships in college,

39:18.359 --> 39:19.436
I mighta gone.

39:19.499 --> 39:20.667
They're not spaceships.

39:20.928 --> 39:22.238
They're metal containers

39:22.263 --> 39:23.774
that propel themselves into the air

39:23.799 --> 39:25.461
based on Newton's third law.

39:26.105 --> 39:28.076
No little green men, then?

39:37.331 --> 39:39.033
You have pretty eyes.

39:39.139 --> 39:41.147
You should look up once in awhile.

39:47.939 --> 39:48.956
So?

39:49.033 --> 39:50.892
Tell me how these rockets work.

39:51.286 --> 39:54.965
Um... when fuel burns,

39:54.990 --> 39:57.065
the pressure in the chamber causes

39:57.425 --> 39:59.834
the hot gas to exit the nozzle.

40:00.327 --> 40:01.762
Fascinating.

40:03.037 --> 40:06.051
Um... it is, actually.

40:06.076 --> 40:08.611
And-And I've over-simplified it.

40:09.579 --> 40:11.345
To get one of these to work properly,

40:11.600 --> 40:13.769
an array of engineering challenges

40:13.794 --> 40:15.295
have to be overcome.

40:15.456 --> 40:16.690
That's what you do?

40:17.471 --> 40:19.139
Overcome them?

40:20.427 --> 40:21.742
Yes, I guess I do.

40:21.802 --> 40:23.270
You know what? I just remembered,

40:23.490 --> 40:25.143
Susan put a roast on.

40:25.459 --> 40:26.737
I've got to go.

40:27.101 --> 40:29.602
You... You're leaving?

40:29.664 --> 40:32.466
Yeah. I'll catch you
at the Arroyo tomorrow.

41:07.294 --> 41:09.059
Jack Parsons?

41:10.658 --> 41:12.794
Mm-hmm.

41:13.007 --> 41:15.341
Oh, I'm glad I caught you.

41:15.476 --> 41:16.777
Honey, I never leave.

41:17.008 --> 41:18.304
Haven't seen the sun in so long,

41:18.329 --> 41:19.889
they're gonna put me in
Lugosi's next picture.

41:20.792 --> 41:23.054
Here's that screen test
you wanted printed.

41:23.181 --> 41:24.418
Screen test?

41:24.554 --> 41:25.853
Who's the actor?

41:26.049 --> 41:27.780
Never seen him before.

41:27.822 --> 41:30.324
Never seen a reel quite
like this before either.

41:30.477 --> 41:32.125
It's very experimental.

41:32.166 --> 41:34.804
Oh, I-I think there might be
some sort of a mix-up.

41:34.829 --> 41:37.077
The footage I'm here for
was shot by my husband.

41:37.151 --> 41:38.763
Yeah. Donovan. I know.

41:38.799 --> 41:40.024
His name's on the can.

41:40.073 --> 41:41.313
Well, it's not a screen test.

41:41.338 --> 41:44.063
He was shooting some kind
of rocket experiments

41:44.088 --> 41:45.773
for a friend up at Caltech.

41:45.889 --> 41:47.508
I didn't see any rockets.

41:47.884 --> 41:50.373
You want to make sure it didn't
get switched at the lab?

41:50.477 --> 41:52.273
Sure.

42:54.009 --> 42:55.889
Yeah, we both loved the same authors.

42:57.645 --> 43:00.961
H.G. Wells, Jules Verne.

43:01.515 --> 43:03.684
That's how it started, I guess.

43:04.536 --> 43:07.401
Jack, of course, imagined
himself as the hero,

43:07.426 --> 43:08.989
swashbuckling through space,

43:09.023 --> 43:12.469
but... I always liked the machines.

43:14.787 --> 43:18.878
These intricate, amazing,
beautiful machines.

43:18.966 --> 43:20.613
And I thought, if I could make

43:20.638 --> 43:23.341
something like that one day, well,

43:24.983 --> 43:27.775
that really would be something.

43:28.244 --> 43:30.718
It sounds like
you should stick with it.

43:32.402 --> 43:34.014
You're really interested
in all of this?

43:35.049 --> 43:36.951
Can't you tell?

43:37.346 --> 43:38.732
I just never met a woman

43:38.757 --> 43:41.074
who didn't mind me
prattling on about it.

43:44.237 --> 43:47.222
I never met anyone
quite like you, neither.

43:51.208 --> 43:52.833
That's my ride home.

43:53.288 --> 43:54.799
Oh.

43:54.969 --> 43:56.637
We could go grab a drink.

43:56.769 --> 43:59.099
You could tell me more
about your rockets.

44:00.200 --> 44:02.836
My bike... I can't take it
on the Red Car.

44:03.698 --> 44:04.979
Oh, well.

44:05.238 --> 44:08.115
It was an honor to meet you,
Richard... Rich.

44:08.314 --> 44:10.184
Sure I'll read about you
in the paper some day.

44:17.214 --> 44:20.828
Marisol! Marisol!

44:21.164 --> 44:22.963
Marisol!

44:23.556 --> 44:25.199
Can I have your number?

44:25.478 --> 44:27.902
Glenview 7537.

45:03.610 --> 45:05.423
I hope I didn't wake you, Father.

45:05.490 --> 45:07.308
You're always a welcome sight,

45:07.400 --> 45:08.635
even at this late hour.

45:10.903 --> 45:13.291
You know, the last time
I saw you looking so worried

45:13.511 --> 45:15.473
was when you caught Betty Parks

45:15.539 --> 45:17.675
stealing the sacramental wine.

45:19.620 --> 45:22.156
Hopefully, this isn't quite as serious.

45:22.744 --> 45:24.291
It's far worse than that.

45:24.411 --> 45:26.331
I found this under my bed.

45:29.282 --> 45:31.117
I think Jack put it there.

45:38.599 --> 45:40.734
To what purpose?

45:40.945 --> 45:42.537
I have no idea.

45:43.677 --> 45:47.023
Our neighbor is part of
some strange... religion,

45:47.523 --> 45:49.471
if you can call it that.

45:49.650 --> 45:51.252
I think Jack may be going, too.

45:51.366 --> 45:52.786
You think?

45:53.040 --> 45:55.476
You mean he's going
without your knowledge?

45:58.438 --> 46:01.308
Have you ever attended any of these...

46:02.233 --> 46:04.067
rituals?

46:05.687 --> 46:07.668
No.

46:08.039 --> 46:11.460
Then it's difficult to know
what we're up against.

46:11.980 --> 46:13.974
What did Jack say
when you confronted him?

46:14.737 --> 46:16.770
I haven't yet.

46:17.378 --> 46:19.713
He's been out all night, like always.

46:20.634 --> 46:22.716
You did well coming to me.

46:25.071 --> 46:27.707
The Bible warns us
against false prophets.

46:28.043 --> 46:30.124
They come dressed in sheep's clothing,

46:30.455 --> 46:32.714
but secretly are wolves.

46:33.213 --> 46:35.540
What do I do to make him see that?

46:37.831 --> 46:41.807
Speak to him about his actions
and be honest about your fears.

46:42.460 --> 46:44.337
What if he keeps going anyway?

46:45.330 --> 46:49.040
This way leads straight to hell, Susan.

46:50.240 --> 46:52.293
Jack is a man of science, isn't he?

46:53.381 --> 46:54.990
Present him with the facts.

46:55.707 --> 46:58.786
Find out everything you can
about this false religion

46:58.819 --> 47:00.719
and lay it bare for him.

47:01.055 --> 47:04.120
He'll be unable to deny the truth

47:04.224 --> 47:05.869
once he's confronted by it.

47:16.876 --> 47:18.229
Richard Onsted?

47:18.669 --> 47:19.747
Yes?

47:19.772 --> 47:21.441
We need you to come with us.

47:23.560 --> 47:25.469
What's this about, Professor?

47:25.593 --> 47:27.628
General Braxton will explain.

47:27.688 --> 47:29.159
<i>Professor Mesulam, Mr. Onsted,</i>

47:29.183 --> 47:31.139
Please, step inside.

47:31.598 --> 47:33.467
We've already rounded up
your compatriots.

47:33.526 --> 47:34.994
It's extremely combustible.

47:35.053 --> 47:37.483
They call it "green dragon"
on account of the flame.

47:37.730 --> 47:39.825
Rich, looks like the military

47:39.850 --> 47:41.952
had a change of heart
about our project.

47:42.464 --> 47:43.964
Now that we're all here,

47:43.998 --> 47:45.288
are you going to tell us
what this is about?

47:45.312 --> 47:46.819
I'll cut to the chase.

47:47.112 --> 47:49.737
What do you all know about
Wernher von Braun?

47:50.284 --> 47:52.886
Boys, it is not secret you correspond

47:52.939 --> 47:54.941
with the German scientist.

47:55.142 --> 47:57.595
You even brag about it, Richard.

47:57.969 --> 48:00.512
Yes, sir, but I may have been
embellishing a little bit.

48:00.537 --> 48:03.318
It's not as if we have a
personal relationship with him.

48:03.417 --> 48:05.652
But you have been carrying
on a correspondence?

48:05.753 --> 48:07.154
Yes, since we were teenagers.

48:07.272 --> 48:08.599
Why, has something happened to him?

48:08.624 --> 48:09.864
You could say that.

48:10.017 --> 48:11.466
This was taken earlier this year

48:11.491 --> 48:13.059
at a testing site in Germany.

48:20.669 --> 48:23.009
It seems your idol has a new patron.

48:23.055 --> 48:25.105
- No, that can't be.
- I'm afraid so.

48:25.184 --> 48:27.399
Our sources tell us
that von Braun is working

48:27.424 --> 48:29.877
on a missile capable of hitting
London from Berlin.

48:30.010 --> 48:32.595
Von Braun is designing weapons
for the Nazis?

48:32.620 --> 48:33.890
They're giving him all the money

48:33.914 --> 48:35.564
and personnel he needs.

48:35.774 --> 48:37.121
If he succeeds,

48:37.183 --> 48:40.262
all of Europe is in grave danger.

48:41.422 --> 48:43.924
How close is he to achieving
his target distance?

48:44.337 --> 48:45.926
We have no idea.

48:46.143 --> 48:48.071
That's where you all come in.

48:48.362 --> 48:50.086
Well, we've made some strides...

48:50.128 --> 48:52.254
He's not talking about our work, Jack.

48:53.178 --> 48:56.008
They want our correspondence
with von Braun.

48:59.173 --> 49:01.909
Here. I don't know
how helpful these will be.

49:04.671 --> 49:06.139
Thank you, son.

49:06.181 --> 49:07.741
I told you this wasn't about your visa.

49:07.766 --> 49:09.246
Hopefully, he let slip some clues

49:09.270 --> 49:10.753
about how far along he is,

49:10.838 --> 49:12.808
or, at the very least,
information that'll help

49:12.833 --> 49:14.402
our scientists play catch-up.

49:14.652 --> 49:17.157
Well, if there's anything
there, we sure missed it.

49:17.754 --> 49:18.864
We'll get these back to you

49:18.889 --> 49:20.160
if they don't yield anything of use.

49:20.194 --> 49:22.983
Don't bother. Just get rid of them.

49:29.614 --> 49:31.184
Gentlemen.

49:43.576 --> 49:44.789
Berlin to London...

49:44.814 --> 49:46.783
That's what, 600 miles?

49:47.569 --> 49:48.944
Can you imagine what we could do

49:48.969 --> 49:52.273
if the military opened their
eyes and decided to back us?

49:53.359 --> 49:54.962
There's a silver lining here.

49:55.223 --> 49:57.097
- What?
- Can't you see it?

49:58.418 --> 50:00.787
What? That-That our hero is a Nazi?

50:00.847 --> 50:03.183
Why do you always look on the downside?

50:03.450 --> 50:05.687
Look up at the moon.

50:06.273 --> 50:08.728
Doesn't it seem that much closer?

50:09.485 --> 50:11.420
Jesus, Jack.

50:11.538 --> 50:12.688
Disgusting.

50:38.786 --> 50:40.955
<i>In life, we all start out ill-formed.</i>

50:45.235 --> 50:47.860
<i>The more people grasp
their true selves,</i>

50:47.885 --> 50:49.420
<i>the more they come into focus.</i>

50:50.107 --> 50:51.493
<i>Do you know why people don't like</i>

50:51.518 --> 50:53.126
<i>having their picture taken?</i>

50:53.159 --> 50:55.508
<i>'Cause they're scared
of what they will see.</i>

50:55.694 --> 50:56.844
<i>She never doubts you?</i>

50:56.883 --> 50:58.104
<i>Makes you feel guilty</i>

50:58.158 --> 51:00.050
<i>or you're not meeting your obligations?</i>

51:00.100 --> 51:02.435
<i>Does she make you feel desired?</i>

51:02.563 --> 51:04.738
<i>People that carry fear
inside them spread that fear</i>

51:04.763 --> 51:06.366
<i>to others. Has she impeded your will?</i>

51:18.613 --> 51:21.482
<i>You seek to leave this realm in body,</i>

51:21.949 --> 51:24.848
<i>we seek to transcend it in spirit.</i>
