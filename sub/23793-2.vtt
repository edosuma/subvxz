>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:34.033 --> 00:36.567
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:36.567 --> 00:37.667
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:37.667 --> 00:38.467
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:38.467 --> 00:41.033
FOR JOINING US.

00:41.033 --> 00:42.133
LOOK, BEFORE WE START THIS

00:42.133 --> 00:43.000
EVENING, A QUICK UPDATE

00:43.000 --> 00:45.533
REGARDING THIS SHOW.

00:45.533 --> 00:46.900
BECAUSE YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT

00:46.900 --> 00:47.967
LAST YEAR,

00:47.967 --> 00:51.633
WE DID AN EPISODE ON COAL.

00:51.633 --> 00:52.500
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS MAN,

00:52.500 --> 00:53.533
BOB MURRAY.

00:53.533 --> 00:54.500
WE SAID A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT

00:54.500 --> 00:55.600
HIM, CULMINATING IN A SEVEN-FOOT

00:55.600 --> 00:56.734
SQUIRREL TELLING HIM

00:56.734 --> 00:59.900
TO EAT SHIT.

00:59.900 --> 01:03.700
AND HE SUED US FOR DEFAMATION.

01:03.700 --> 01:04.600
IT'S TRUE.

01:04.600 --> 01:05.867
THAT CASE HAS BEEN GOING ON EVER

01:05.867 --> 01:06.500
SINCE, BUT THIS WEEK, WE LEARNED

01:06.500 --> 01:07.433
THE JUDGE HAS SAID HE'S GOING TO

01:07.433 --> 01:12.400
DISMISS IT

01:12.400 --> 01:13.834
IT'S NOT FINAL YET,

01:13.834 --> 01:15.734
IT'S NOT FINAL YET,

01:15.734 --> 01:17.000
I'VE BEEN ADVISED NOT TO SAY

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
MUCH MORE FOR NOW.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.266
SO I WON'T.

01:19.266 --> 01:20.533
BECAUSE NOW IS NOT THE TIME

01:20.533 --> 01:22.433
FOR VICTORY LAPS.

01:22.433 --> 01:24.300
IT'S NOT A TIME FOR GLOATING.

01:24.300 --> 01:25.233
IT'S NOT A TIME FOR SAYING,

01:25.233 --> 01:28.333
"HEY, WE WON," AND JUST RUBBING

01:28.333 --> 01:29.834
IT IN THE FACE OF THE PERSON

01:29.834 --> 01:32.433
WHO LOST OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

01:32.433 --> 01:35.967
THAT TIME WILL COME.

01:35.967 --> 01:37.900
IT WILL COME.

01:37.900 --> 01:38.900
AND I PROMISE, WE WILL DISCUSS

01:38.900 --> 01:39.567
THIS WHOLE CASE AS SOON AS

01:39.567 --> 01:40.433
WE ARE ABLE TO.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.633
UNTIL THEN, MY FURRY FRIEND,

01:41.633 --> 01:42.834
AWAY!

01:42.834 --> 01:45.567
AWAY!

01:45.567 --> 01:49.300
HE'LL BE BACK.

01:49.300 --> 01:51.100
I PROMISE.

01:51.100 --> 01:53.033
FOR NOW, LET'S MOVE ON TO

01:53.033 --> 01:54.600
A QUICK RECAP OF THE WEK, WHICH

01:54.600 --> 01:55.967
WAS DOMINATED BY THE CONTINUING

01:55.967 --> 01:56.567
DEBATE OVER GUN CONTROL IN THE

01:56.567 --> 01:57.266
WAKE OF LAST WEEK'S

01:57.266 --> 01:58.400
SCHOOL SHOOTING.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.533
BUT DON'T WORRY.

02:00.533 --> 02:01.600
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID

02:01.600 --> 02:02.533
HE'S DETERMINED TO STOP THIS

02:02.533 --> 02:04.200
FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN,

02:04.200 --> 02:05.467
AND HE EVEN GAVE US A GLIMPSE

02:05.467 --> 02:06.700
OF HIS NEW PLAN.

02:06.700 --> 02:07.867
>> WHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS

02:07.867 --> 02:09.500
HE'S LISTENING TO NEW IDEAS

02:09.500 --> 02:10.867
ABOUT SCHOOL SAFETY,

02:10.867 --> 02:12.533
HE EMPHASIZED ARMING TEACHERS

02:12.533 --> 02:14.500
AND OTHER SCHOOL PERSONNEL,

02:14.500 --> 02:16.033
AN IDEA BACKED BY THE NATIONAL

02:16.033 --> 02:18.266
RIFLE ASSOCIATION.

02:18.266 --> 02:19.500
>> WE NEED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.200
YOU COME INTO OUR SCHOOLS,

02:21.200 --> 02:22.767
YOU'RE GONNA BE DEAD,

02:22.767 --> 02:26.700
AND IT'S GOING TO BE FAST.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.567
>> John: OKAY, SO FIRST THING.

02:28.567 --> 02:29.400
"YOU'RE GOING TO BE DEAD,

02:29.400 --> 02:30.333
AND IT'S GOING TO BE FAST"

02:30.333 --> 02:31.633
IS ALREADY THE SLOGAN

02:31.633 --> 02:32.633
FOR CARL'S JR., SO YOU CAN'T USE

02:32.633 --> 02:34.266
THAT.

02:34.266 --> 02:35.900
BUT TRUMP'S SUPPORT FOR THIS

02:35.900 --> 02:37.467
CLEARLY TERRIBLE IDEA SEEMED

02:37.467 --> 02:38.734
TO DEVELOP OVER THE WEEK.

02:38.734 --> 02:39.667
HE ACTUALLY FOCUS-GROUPED IT

02:39.667 --> 02:40.400
ON WEDNESDAY DURING

02:40.400 --> 02:41.834
A LISTENING SESSION FEATURING

02:41.834 --> 02:43.700
SURVIVORS OF THE SHOOTING,

02:43.700 --> 02:45.433
A SESSION, INCIDENTALLY, FOR

02:45.433 --> 02:46.333
WHICH HIS OWN NOTES INCLUDED

02:46.333 --> 02:49.367
A REMINDER TO SAY, "I HEAR YOU,"

02:49.367 --> 02:50.700
WHICH IS WHAT YOU MIGHT WRITE

02:50.700 --> 02:51.667
DOWN IF YOU WERE A ROBOT

02:51.667 --> 02:52.834
PRETENDING TO BE A PERSON

02:52.834 --> 02:54.367
PRETENDING TO BE A ROBOT

02:54.367 --> 02:56.600
PRETENDING TO BE A PERSON.

02:56.600 --> 02:59.200
AND NOT SURPRISINGLY,

02:59.200 --> 03:00.734
ARMING SOME TEACHERS DIDN'T GO

03:00.734 --> 03:02.333
DOWN TOO WELL IN THERE.

03:02.333 --> 03:03.166
WATCH WHAT HAPPENED WHEN

03:03.166 --> 03:04.133
HE ASKED FOR A SHOW OF HANDS.

03:04.133 --> 03:05.734
>> DOES ANYBODY LIKE THAT IDEA?

03:05.734 --> 03:06.600
HERE?

03:06.600 --> 03:08.233
DOES ANYBODY LIKE IT?

03:08.233 --> 03:08.767
RIGHT?

03:08.767 --> 03:11.433
YES?

03:11.433 --> 03:12.467
FOR MEADOW,

03:12.467 --> 03:13.066
YOUR BEAUTIFUL MEADOW.

03:13.066 --> 03:15.967
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT.

03:15.967 --> 03:16.767
AND DO PEOPLE FEEL STRONGLY

03:16.767 --> 03:17.667
AGAINST IT?

03:17.667 --> 03:18.567
ANYBODY, ANYBODY?

03:18.567 --> 03:19.567
STRONGLY AGAINST IT?

03:19.567 --> 03:20.834
ALL RIGHT.

03:20.834 --> 03:21.467
LOOK, WE CAN UNDERSTAND

03:21.467 --> 03:23.200
BOTH SIDES.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.266
>> John: THAT IS DONALD TRUMP

03:24.266 --> 03:25.300
IN A NUTSHELL:

03:25.300 --> 03:26.834
PROPOSING A TERRIBLE IDEA

03:26.834 --> 03:28.166
IN A TONE-DEAF WAY,

03:28.166 --> 03:30.900
THEN REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE

03:30.900 --> 03:34.300
HE JUST LOST A POPULAR VOTE.

03:34.300 --> 03:36.033
NOW, THERE ARE CLEARLY MULTIPLE

03:36.033 --> 03:37.767
ISSUES WITH THE IDEA OF ARMING

03:37.767 --> 03:39.567
TEACHERS, FROM THE FACT THAT

03:39.567 --> 03:40.700
THAT'S NOT THEIR JOB TO THE FACT

03:40.700 --> 03:41.967
THAT THERE WAS AN ARMED DEPUTY

03:41.967 --> 03:43.133
IN PARKLAND AND THAT DIDN'T

03:43.133 --> 03:44.600
DETER OR STOP THE SHOOTER,

03:44.600 --> 03:46.367
BUT EVEN THE LOGISTICS OF IT

03:46.367 --> 03:48.400
ARE PRETTY DAUNTING.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.767
>> THERE ARE OVER 3 MILLION

03:49.767 --> 03:51.367
PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS

03:51.367 --> 03:52.900
NATIONWIDE AND 400,000

03:52.900 --> 03:54.834
IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS.

03:54.834 --> 03:56.734
ARMING 20% OF THEM, AS MR. TRUMP

03:56.734 --> 03:58.166
SUGGESTED THURSDAY, WOULD MEAN

03:58.166 --> 04:00.266
MORE THAN 700,000 PEOPLE

04:00.266 --> 04:04.500
WITH GUNS IN SCHOOLS.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.633
>> John: YEAH, SO IT'S NO WONDER

04:05.633 --> 04:06.200
THE NRA LIKES THIS SOLUTION.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.233
IT INVOLVES BUYING HUNDREDS

04:07.233 --> 04:09.033
OF THOUSANDS OF GUNS.

04:09.033 --> 04:09.667
THAT'S THEIR SOLUTION

04:09.667 --> 04:10.834
TO EVERYTING.

04:10.834 --> 04:11.700
THEY'D PROBABLY DEAL

04:11.700 --> 04:12.433
WITH CLIMATE CHANGE BY

04:12.433 --> 04:14.467
POINTING A GLOCK AT THE OCEAN

04:14.467 --> 04:15.467
AND DARING THAT MOTHERFUCKER

04:15.467 --> 04:18.633
TO RISE.

04:18.633 --> 04:19.934
AND IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT ONE

04:19.934 --> 04:21.200
OF THE MANY KEY GROUPS

04:21.200 --> 04:22.500
EXPRESSING DOUBTS ABOUT THIS

04:22.500 --> 04:25.100
IDEA IS TEACHERS.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.166
>> THIS DOES NOT PASS ANY COMMON

04:26.166 --> 04:28.633
SENSE TEST WHATSOEVER.

04:28.633 --> 04:29.867
>> THE NATIONAL EDUCATION

04:29.867 --> 04:34.500
ASSOCIATION SAID MORE GUNS

04:34.500 --> 04:35.900
IN A SCHOOL IS NOT THE SOLUTION.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.600
>> THE PROBLEM IS THAT VERY

04:37.600 --> 04:39.266
DANGEROUS PEOPLE HAVE VERY EASY

04:39.266 --> 04:41.266
ACCESS TO VERY DANGEROUS

04:41.266 --> 04:43.467
WEAPONS.

04:43.467 --> 04:44.700
>> John: SHE'S RIGHT, AND SHE'S

04:44.700 --> 04:46.633
USING THE PATIENT, EXASPERATED

04:46.633 --> 04:48.333
TONE OF A TEACHER EXPLAINING

04:48.333 --> 04:51.233
SOMETHING TO THE DUMBEST STUDENT

04:51.233 --> 04:53.200
IN HER CLASS, WHICH, IN A WAY,

04:53.200 --> 04:55.500
SHE IS.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.333
"DONALD, YOUR ANSWER

04:56.333 --> 04:58.533
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

04:58.533 --> 04:59.967
ALSO, WE DON'T ACTUALLY WANT

04:59.967 --> 05:01.433
LESS GUNS IN SCHOOLS.

05:01.433 --> 05:03.533
WE WANT FEWER GUNS IN SCHOOLS.

05:03.533 --> 05:04.233
DONALD.

05:04.233 --> 05:05.200
DONALD.

05:05.200 --> 05:05.967
FOCUS, DONALD.

05:05.967 --> 05:06.700
1, 2, 3.

05:06.700 --> 05:10.166
ALL EYES ON ME."

05:10.166 --> 05:11.700
FOR NOW, LET'S MOVE ON TO INDIA.

05:11.700 --> 05:12.567
AN ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL

05:12.567 --> 05:14.467
POWERHOUSE, AND THE REASON YOUR

05:14.467 --> 05:15.467
MOST ANNOYING FRIEND WON'T

05:15.467 --> 05:17.033
SHUT UP ABOUT BIKRAM YOGA.

05:17.033 --> 05:18.333
"WE GET IT, PAISLEY.

05:18.333 --> 05:22.200
YOU CAN FUCK UPSIDE DOWN NOW."

05:22.200 --> 05:23.100
THIS WEEK, INDIA HOSTED A NUMBER

05:23.100 --> 05:24.266
OF FOREIGN DIGNITARIES.

05:24.266 --> 05:25.033
FIRST, THERE WAS CANADIAN

05:25.033 --> 05:26.500
PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU,

05:26.500 --> 05:27.667
WHOSE VISIT GOT OFF TO

05:27.667 --> 05:29.166
A ROCKY START.

05:29.166 --> 05:30.367
>> PRIME MINISTER MODI'S GLARING

05:30.367 --> 05:31.600
SILENCE ON THE VISIT OF CANADIAN

05:31.600 --> 05:32.867
PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU

05:32.867 --> 05:35.767
TO INDIA HASN'T GONE UNNOTICED.

05:35.767 --> 05:36.967
NO WELCOME TWEET, NO AIRPORT

05:36.967 --> 05:38.400
HUG, AND NO JOINT VISIT

05:38.400 --> 05:40.233
TO GUJURAT.

05:40.233 --> 05:41.433
IS CANADA'S PRIME MINISTER

05:41.433 --> 05:42.233
JUSTIN TRUDEAU GETTING

05:42.233 --> 05:44.467
THE MODI SNUB?

05:44.467 --> 05:45.734
>> John: OUCH!

05:45.734 --> 05:47.333
IT SEEMS LIKE MODI'S TREATING

05:47.333 --> 05:48.600
TRUDEAU LIKE A GUY WHO FINISHES

05:48.600 --> 05:49.934
THIRD ON "THE BACHELORETTE,"

05:49.934 --> 05:51.233
WHICH, LET'S FACE IT,

05:51.233 --> 05:52.033
IS ACTUALLY WHAT

05:52.033 --> 05:55.100
JUSTIN TRUDEAU LOOKS LIKE.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.867
OH, HE'D GET TO HOMETOWNS.

05:56.867 --> 05:57.767
BUT AFTER FANTASY SUITE,

05:57.767 --> 05:59.734
IT'S DONE-ZO.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.033
NOW, THAT SNUB MAY HAVE

06:01.033 --> 06:02.400
ITS ROOTS IN TRUDEAU'S PERCEIVED

06:02.400 --> 06:03.667
SOFT APPROACH TO SIKH EXTREMIST

06:03.667 --> 06:05.367
GROUPS IN CANADA.

06:05.367 --> 06:06.700
AND HE DIDN'T HELP THE SITUATION

06:06.700 --> 06:08.767
BY GOING IN HEAVY ON THE

06:08.767 --> 06:09.700
NATIONAL-DRESS PANDERING,

06:09.700 --> 06:10.800
WITH INDIAN OUTFIT

06:10.800 --> 06:14.066
AFTER INDIAN OUTFIT THAT SEEMED

06:14.066 --> 06:15.066
A BIT MUCH.

06:15.066 --> 06:16.567
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE, WHEN MODI

06:16.567 --> 06:17.834
VISITS OTTOWA, HE TURNS UP

06:17.834 --> 06:20.033
IN FULL CANADIAN FORMAL DRESS,

06:20.033 --> 06:21.333
BY WHICH I MEAN A GRAVY-STAINED

06:21.333 --> 06:22.734
TORONTO RAPTORS JERSEY

06:22.734 --> 06:26.100
AND ROOTS SWEATPANTS.

06:26.100 --> 06:27.266
AND IT'S NOT JUST ME

06:27.266 --> 06:28.066
WHO FOUND IT OVER THE TOP.

06:28.066 --> 06:28.533
LISTEN TO THIS INDIAN

06:28.533 --> 06:30.367
FASHION DESIGNER.

06:30.367 --> 06:32.533
>> WELL, I THOUGHT IT WAS

06:32.533 --> 06:36.333
A LITTLE TOO INDIAN FOR INDIANS.

06:36.333 --> 06:37.633
A LITTLE TACKY WHEN IT

06:37.633 --> 06:39.367
CAME TO THE SARTORIAL CHOICES.

06:39.367 --> 06:40.133
I'M GLAD IT'S A CANADIAN

06:40.133 --> 06:41.133
DESIGNER.

06:41.133 --> 06:44.200
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT AN INDIAN

06:44.200 --> 06:45.033
DESIGNER WHO MADE THIS FASHION

06:45.033 --> 06:45.767
BLUNDER.

06:45.767 --> 06:47.500
HE LOOKED LIKE A BACKUP DANCER

06:47.500 --> 06:52.133
FOR A CHEAP BOLLYWOOD MOVIE.

06:52.133 --> 06:53.633
>> John: OOH!

06:53.633 --> 06:54.633
"A CHEAP BOLLYWOOD MOVIE."

06:54.633 --> 06:56.166
THAT IS A SOLID ZING FROM INDIAN

06:56.166 --> 06:57.266
TIM GUNN.

06:57.266 --> 06:58.266
TRUDEAU'S VISIT TURNED OUT TO BE

06:58.266 --> 06:59.333
THE MOST UNWATCHABLE

06:59.333 --> 07:00.100
WHITE PERSON'S TRIP THROUGH

07:00.100 --> 07:01.266
INDIA SINCE

07:01.266 --> 07:03.367
"THE DARJEELING LIMITED."

07:03.367 --> 07:04.500
BUT TRUDEAU WAS ACTUALLY LUCKY,

07:04.500 --> 07:05.633
BECAUSE HIS TRIP WAS

07:05.633 --> 07:06.500
OVERSHADOWED BY A VISIT

07:06.500 --> 07:08.300
FROM DONALD TRUMP JR.,

07:08.300 --> 07:09.567
NAMED MAN OF THE YEAR BY

07:09.567 --> 07:11.066
"DADDY ISSUES" MAGAZINE

07:11.066 --> 07:12.767
40 YEARS RUNNING.

07:12.767 --> 07:15.200
SO WHAT BROUGHT AMERICA'S

07:15.200 --> 07:16.100
GREATEST-LIVING DONALD TRUMP

07:16.100 --> 07:17.767
TO INDIA?

07:17.767 --> 07:18.667
WAS IT A PROFOUND SENSE OF

07:18.667 --> 07:20.600
WANDERLUST?

07:20.600 --> 07:22.600
OR DID, PERHAPS, A TRASH PILE OF

07:22.600 --> 07:25.567
SHITTY CONDOS NEED UNLOADING?

07:25.567 --> 07:28.834
I WON'T KEEP YOU IN SUSPENSE.

07:28.834 --> 07:30.433
>> DONALD JR. ARRIVING

07:30.433 --> 07:31.734
TODAY USING THE TRUMP BRAND

07:31.734 --> 07:32.667
TO SELL NEW LUXURY APARTMENTS.

07:32.667 --> 07:33.700
NEWSPAPER ADS IN THE COUNTRY

07:33.700 --> 07:34.467
TOUTING, "TRUMP HAS ARRIVED.

07:34.467 --> 07:37.367
HAVE YOU?"

07:37.367 --> 07:38.300
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, "TRUMP HAS

07:38.300 --> 07:40.100
ARRIVED" IS UNQUESTIONABLY WHAT

07:40.100 --> 07:43.934
DON JR. SAYS WHEN HE ORGASMS.

07:43.934 --> 07:44.834
HE SAVES THE "HAVE YOU?"

07:44.834 --> 07:46.967
FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.667
AND ALSO, THAT'S A PRETTY

07:48.667 --> 07:49.934
MISLEADING AD.

07:49.934 --> 07:50.934
WHEN YOU SAY "TRUMP HAS

07:50.934 --> 07:52.700
ARRIVED," PEOPLE ASSUME YOU MEAN

07:52.700 --> 07:54.400
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

07:54.400 --> 07:56.567
STATES, NOT DON, JR.

07:56.567 --> 07:58.166
IT'S LIKE IF ED SULLIVAN WENT,

07:58.166 --> 07:58.633
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

07:58.633 --> 08:00.000
THE BEATLES!"

08:00.000 --> 08:01.266
AND THEN THE STUDIO WAS JUST

08:01.266 --> 08:07.233
OVERRUN WITH BEETLES.

08:07.233 --> 08:09.700
THAT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE

08:09.700 --> 08:10.600
SIGNED UP FOR.

08:10.600 --> 08:11.700
AND IF YOU THINK THAT'S HARSH,

08:11.700 --> 08:12.300
EVEN THOSE PRESENT WERE A TAD

08:12.300 --> 08:13.166
DISAPPOINTED, WITH ONE

08:13.166 --> 08:13.800
REAL-ESTATE DEVELOPER TELLING

08:13.800 --> 08:14.700
"THE WASHINGTON POST,"

08:14.700 --> 08:15.800
"IDEALLY WE'D HAVE PREFERRED

08:15.800 --> 08:16.500
IVANKA."

08:16.500 --> 08:17.767
WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE,

08:17.767 --> 08:19.266
BUT YOU'RE COMING OFF A LITTLE

08:19.266 --> 08:20.333
UNGRATEFUL, INDIA.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.867
JUST BE THANKFUL

08:21.867 --> 08:25.900
YOU DIDN'T GET ERIC.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.633
IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.

08:27.633 --> 08:28.467
NOW, DON, JR.'S TRIP STARTED OFF

08:28.467 --> 08:29.867
A LITTLE BUMPY AS WELL.

08:29.867 --> 08:31.900
HE SAT DOWN WITH CNBC INDIA FOR

08:31.900 --> 08:33.467
A SOFTBALL INTERVIEW IN WHICH HE

08:33.467 --> 08:35.033
SOMEHOW MANAGED TO GIVE THE ONLY

08:35.033 --> 08:37.000
WRONG ANSWER TO THE QUESTION,

08:37.000 --> 08:37.834
"CAN YOU SAY ONE THING YOU LIKE

08:37.834 --> 08:40.000
ABOUT INDIA?"

08:40.000 --> 08:41.400
>> I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING

08:41.400 --> 08:42.233
ABOUT THE SPIRIT OF THE INDIAN

08:42.233 --> 08:43.700
PEOPLE THAT'S UNIQUE HERE

08:43.700 --> 08:44.600
TO OTHER PARTS OF THE EMERGING

08:44.600 --> 08:46.066
WORLD.

08:46.066 --> 08:48.100
I CAN, YOU KNOW, YOU GO THROUGH

08:48.100 --> 08:49.367
A TOWN AND YOU, YOU KNOW,

08:49.367 --> 08:50.400
I DON'T MEAN TO BE GLIB ABOUT

08:50.400 --> 08:51.867
IT, BUT YOU CAN SEE THE POOREST

08:51.867 --> 08:54.667
OF THE POOR, AND THERE'S STILL

08:54.667 --> 08:55.600
A SMILE ON A FACE.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.400
YOU SAY HELLO.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.600
IT'S A DIFFERENT SPIRIT THAT YOU

08:58.600 --> 08:59.467
DON'T SEE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE

08:59.467 --> 09:03.266
WORLD.

09:03.266 --> 09:05.233
>> John: OKAY, LOOK.

09:05.233 --> 09:06.166
CONDESCENDING TONE ASIDE,

09:06.166 --> 09:06.967
I'LL JUST POINT OUT THAT

09:06.967 --> 09:07.767
EVEN IF "THE POOREST OF THE

09:07.767 --> 09:09.533
POOR" WERE SMILING AT DON, JR.,

09:09.533 --> 09:10.700
THERE'S NO WAY THEY WEREN'T ALSO

09:10.700 --> 09:11.700
THINKING, "WE WOULD HAVE

09:11.700 --> 09:15.400
PREFERRED IVANKA."

09:15.400 --> 09:16.567
BUT THE SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEM WITH

09:16.567 --> 09:18.233
THIS TRIP WAS THE ETHICAL

09:18.233 --> 09:19.700
QUESTIONS IT POSED, IN PART

09:19.700 --> 09:20.300
BECAUSE THOSE WHO BOUGHT IN TO

09:20.300 --> 09:21.767
THE CONDOS GOT OFFERED

09:21.767 --> 09:23.066
"CONVERSATION AND DINNER"

09:23.066 --> 09:24.533
WITH DON, JR., WHICH IS FINE FOR

09:24.533 --> 09:26.166
A PRIVATE CITIZEN BUT BECOMES

09:26.166 --> 09:27.400
PROBLEMATIC IF HE'S PERCEIVED AS

09:27.400 --> 09:28.800
REPRESENTING THE GOVERNMENT.

09:28.800 --> 09:29.934
AND WHILE HE INSISTED THAT HE

09:29.934 --> 09:31.700
WAS JUST A PRIVATE BUSINESSMAN

09:31.700 --> 09:33.834
DOING PRIVATE BUSINESS,

09:33.834 --> 09:35.734
ONE SPEECH WAS ORIGINALLY

09:35.734 --> 09:37.700
TITLED, "RESHAPING INDO-PACIFIC

09:37.700 --> 09:39.600
TIES: THE NEW ERA OF

09:39.600 --> 09:40.834
COOPERATION," WHICH SURE AS SHIT

09:40.834 --> 09:42.500
SOUNDS LIKE FOREIGN POLICY.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.834
AND THEY MUST'VE REALIZED IT WAS

09:43.834 --> 09:45.400
A PROBLEM, BECAUSE THE TITLE WAS

09:45.400 --> 09:47.500
LATER CHANGED TO "FIRESIDE CHAT

09:47.500 --> 09:48.934
WITH DONALD TRUMP JR.,

09:48.934 --> 09:49.967
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT,

09:49.967 --> 09:52.767
THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION."

09:52.767 --> 09:53.467
PRESUMABLY, IN BETWEEN,

09:53.467 --> 09:54.300
IT WAS BILLED AS

09:54.300 --> 09:55.734
"BIG BOY BUSINESS WITH

09:55.734 --> 09:58.567
I'M DONALD TRUMP TOO."

09:58.567 --> 09:59.967
STILL, I WILL SAY THIS

09:59.967 --> 10:01.400
IN DONALD JR.'S DEFENSE:

10:01.400 --> 10:02.367
IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR HIM

10:02.367 --> 10:03.633
TO SELL ACCESS TO HIS FATHER'S

10:03.633 --> 10:05.433
INNER CIRCLE, BECAUSE, AS HE

10:05.433 --> 10:06.533
REVEALED DURING THAT FIRESIDE

10:06.533 --> 10:08.333
CHAT, HE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

10:08.333 --> 10:10.033
ANYWHERE NEAR IT.

10:10.033 --> 10:10.767
>> WHAT ARE CONVERSATIONS

10:10.767 --> 10:12.233
AT HOME LIKE?

10:12.233 --> 10:13.300
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, AGAIN,

10:13.300 --> 10:14.200
I THINK, THESE DAYS, I SEE HIM

10:14.200 --> 10:14.967
SO LITTLE THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY

10:14.967 --> 10:16.400
TALK POLITICS.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.166
NOW WHEN I THINK, "HEY,

10:18.166 --> 10:19.867
WHY DON'T I CALL HIM JUST TO SAY

10:19.867 --> 10:20.967
HI," I THINK ABOUT THE STUFF

10:20.967 --> 10:21.533
THAT HE'S DEALING WITH

10:21.533 --> 10:22.834
ON A DAILY BASIS.

10:22.834 --> 10:24.100
WHEN SOMETHING GOES ON,

10:24.100 --> 10:24.967
YOU KNOW, IN A COUNTRY FAR,

10:24.967 --> 10:26.100
FAR AWAY, AND I'M --

10:26.100 --> 10:26.767
MAN, I DON'T EVEN WANT TO BOTHER

10:26.767 --> 10:27.633
HIM.

10:27.633 --> 10:29.200
I FEEL IT'S ALMOST TRITE TO CALL

10:29.200 --> 10:30.266
HIM AND JUST TO SAY HELLO.

10:30.266 --> 10:31.834
DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE?

10:31.834 --> 10:34.500
IT PROBABLY DOESN'T.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.233
>> John: NO.

10:35.233 --> 10:37.900
IT DOESN'T.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.567
AT ALL.

10:39.567 --> 10:40.600
CALLING YOUR DAD JUST TO SAY

10:40.600 --> 10:41.533
HELLO COULD NEVER SEEM TRITE.

10:41.533 --> 10:42.633
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST NOT WHAT

10:42.633 --> 10:46.834
THE WORD "TRITE" MEANS.

10:46.834 --> 10:47.867
IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM.

10:47.867 --> 10:48.500
BUT I WILL SAY THIS: HE CAN CALL

10:48.500 --> 10:49.367
HIS DAD OR NOT CALL HIM.

10:49.367 --> 10:49.834
IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE

10:49.834 --> 10:50.633
A DIFFERENCE.

10:50.633 --> 10:51.567
BECAUSE AFTER THIS WEEK,

10:51.567 --> 10:52.700
IF WE'VE LEARNED ONE THING ABOUT

10:52.700 --> 10:54.100
DONALD TRUMP, IT'S THAT YOU CAN

10:54.100 --> 10:56.100
BE SITTING RIGHT IN FRONT OF

10:56.100 --> 10:57.667
HIM, AND HE CAN EVEN TELL YOU HE

10:57.667 --> 11:02.133
HEARS YOU, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

11:02.133 --> 11:03.266
HE'S LISTENING TO A FUCKING WORD

11:03.266 --> 11:03.767
YOU'RE SAYING.

11:03.767 --> 11:11.033
AND NOW THIS.

11:11.033 --> 11:16.133
>> MY FIRST MEMORY OF LITERALLY

11:16.133 --> 11:17.734
GRILLING MY OWN THUMB.

11:17.734 --> 11:19.333
NOT A PLEASANT MEMORY.

11:19.333 --> 11:21.533
GOOD THING I CAN'T FEEL MY

11:21.533 --> 11:22.133
FINGERS.

11:22.133 --> 11:23.333
IT'S OKAY.

11:23.333 --> 11:24.734
I CAN'T FEEL MY DIGITS.

11:24.734 --> 11:27.533
>> I CAN'T FEEL MY FINGERS.

11:27.533 --> 11:31.133
I CAN'T FEEL MOST OF MY FINGERS.

11:31.133 --> 11:33.767
>> THIS FINGER IS SO DEAD, I

11:33.767 --> 11:35.934
THAT PEOPLE HOW LONG I CAN LEAVE

11:35.934 --> 11:37.133
IT IN A FLAME.

11:37.133 --> 11:38.533
IT'S LIKE A DEAD FINGER.

11:38.533 --> 11:41.533
NO SENSATION LEFT.

11:41.533 --> 11:43.133
A LITTLE BIT OF SALT IN THE

11:43.133 --> 11:46.500
SAUCE AND OVER THE SHOULDER FOR

11:46.500 --> 11:51.900
LOCK.

11:51.900 --> 11:56.333
-- LUCK.

11:56.333 --> 11:57.500
>> John: MOVING ON.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.500
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

11:58.500 --> 11:59.834
ITALY, THE COUNTRY THAT GAVE US

11:59.834 --> 12:01.567
SPAGHETTI, THE COLOSSEUM,

12:01.567 --> 12:02.533
AND IN A ROUNDABOUT WAY,

12:02.533 --> 12:04.467
THE GUY WHO PLAYED TURTLE.

12:04.467 --> 12:06.266
SO IT'S A RICH TAPESTRY

12:06.266 --> 12:07.433
IS WHAT I'M SAYING.

12:07.433 --> 12:08.767
ITALY IS HOLDING AN ELECTION

12:08.767 --> 12:09.834
NEXT SUNDAY TO SELECT A NEW

12:09.834 --> 12:10.467
PARLIAMENT AND EVENTUALLY A NEW

12:10.467 --> 12:11.100
PRIME MINISTER.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.967
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING,

12:12.967 --> 12:14.166
"I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO ITALY'S

12:14.166 --> 12:16.667
CURRENT PRIME MINISTER IS.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.500
I ASSUMED IT WAS JUST A VESPA

12:18.500 --> 12:19.467
IN A TANK TOP."

12:19.467 --> 12:20.300
WELL, DON'T BE TOO HARD

12:20.300 --> 12:22.000
ON YOURSELF.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.567
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF THEM.

12:23.567 --> 12:25.266
THIS WILL BE ITALY'S 65TH

12:25.266 --> 12:26.367
GOVERNMENT IN JUST OVER

12:26.367 --> 12:27.900
70 YEARS.

12:27.900 --> 12:28.734
AT THAT RATE, IT'S PROBABLY HARD

12:28.734 --> 12:30.133
FOR ITALIANS TO REMEMBER

12:30.133 --> 12:31.433
WHO THEIR LEADER IS.

12:31.433 --> 12:33.333
FOR THE RECORD, IT'S THIS MAN.

12:33.333 --> 12:34.433
ALSO, FOR THE RECORD,

12:34.433 --> 12:36.200
IT'S NOT THAT MAN.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.300
I JUST TYPED "ITALIAN MAN"

12:37.300 --> 12:42.200
INTO A STOCK IMAGE SITE

12:42.200 --> 12:43.567
AND HE IS WHAT CAME UP.

12:43.567 --> 12:44.166
THIS ELECTION IS COMING AT

12:44.166 --> 12:45.567
A PIVOTAL TIME FOR ITALY AND THE

12:45.567 --> 12:47.533
RUN-UP TO IT HAS BEEN TOXIC.

12:47.533 --> 12:49.100
>> ITALY IS SEEING A RISE IN

12:49.100 --> 12:50.667
POLITICAL VIOLENCE AHEAD OF ITS

12:50.667 --> 12:52.667
NATIONAL ELECTIONS ON MARCH 4TH.

12:52.667 --> 12:53.900
ON THURSDAY, RIOT-EQUIPPED

12:53.900 --> 12:55.734
POLICE FIRED WATER CANONS

12:55.734 --> 12:58.433
AND TEAR GAS AS THEY CLASHED

12:58.433 --> 12:59.700
WITH FAR LEFT PROTESTERS

12:59.700 --> 13:00.967
MARCHING AGAINST A NEARBY

13:00.967 --> 13:02.467
NEO-FASCIST RALLY.

13:02.467 --> 13:04.066
OVER THE PAST MONTH, THERE HAVE

13:04.066 --> 13:05.700
BEEN SERIES OF POLITICAL

13:05.700 --> 13:06.967
MOTIVATED STABBINGS AND BEATINGS

13:06.967 --> 13:11.433
IN SOME ITALIAN CITIES.

13:11.433 --> 13:12.400
>> John: IT'S TRUE, ITALY IS

13:12.400 --> 13:12.900
IN TURMOIL AND DABBLING

13:12.900 --> 13:13.967
WITH FASCISM.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.233
AND THAT SHOULD WORRY EVERYONE,

13:15.233 --> 13:17.166
BECAUSE LAST TIME THEY DID THAT,

13:17.166 --> 13:19.066
THEY WOUND UP WITH MUSSOLINI,

13:19.066 --> 13:20.800
THE, TO PUT IT NICELY,

13:20.800 --> 13:24.400
TURNER TO HITLER'S "HOOCH."

13:24.400 --> 13:26.400
AND SADLY, THE CONDITIONS ARE

13:26.400 --> 13:28.000
RIPE FOR FASCISM TO FLOURISH.

13:28.000 --> 13:28.900
ITALY IS EUROPE'S THIRD-LARGEST

13:28.900 --> 13:30.133
ECONOMY, YET ITS PUBLIC DEBT

13:30.133 --> 13:32.834
IS 130% OF GDP.

13:32.834 --> 13:33.800
FOR CONTEXT, THAT'S SECOND ONLY

13:33.800 --> 13:35.433
TO GREECE.

13:35.433 --> 13:36.433
AND THE BANK OF GREECE

13:36.433 --> 13:37.967
IS CURRENTLY JUST A GOAT

13:37.967 --> 13:40.734
DANCING AROUND AN OPEN FIRE.

13:40.734 --> 13:42.300
MEANWHILE, UNEMPLOYMENT IS HIGH,

13:42.300 --> 13:43.300
AND POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN

13:43.300 --> 13:44.600
STOKING ANTI-IMMIGRANT

13:44.600 --> 13:46.300
SENTIMENTS AS MORE THAN 600,000

13:46.300 --> 13:47.934
MIGRANTS HAVE LANDED ON ITALIAN

13:47.934 --> 13:50.233
SHORES IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS.

13:50.233 --> 13:51.934
AND ON TOP OF ALL THIS, ITALY IS

13:51.934 --> 13:53.066
FACING THE SAME PROBLEM THAT HAS

13:53.066 --> 13:55.066
PLAGUED AMERICAN ELECTIONS.

13:55.066 --> 13:56.967
>> PATRIZIO NISSIRIO IS A SENIOR

13:56.967 --> 13:58.200
EDITOR AT ANSA, ITALY'S LEADING

13:58.200 --> 13:59.500
NEWS AGENCY.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.433
HE SAYS FAKE NEWS IS EXPLODING

14:01.433 --> 14:04.300
ACROSS EUROPE.

14:04.300 --> 14:07.066
>> IT'S SUCH A DANGER THAT

14:07.066 --> 14:10.033
FIGURES LIKE POPE FRANCIS WARNED

14:10.033 --> 14:11.433
THE PRESS NOT TO SPREAD.

14:11.433 --> 14:14.500
YOU KNOW, WHAT HE -- HE ACTUALLY

14:14.500 --> 14:16.467
MADE A STRONG PARALLEL BETWEEN

14:16.467 --> 14:20.667
FECES AND THIS KIND OF NEWS.

14:20.667 --> 14:21.500
>> John: THAT'S TRUE!

14:21.500 --> 14:22.834
THE POPE REPORTEDLY SAID

14:22.834 --> 14:24.433
FAKE NEWS IS LIKE GETTING

14:24.433 --> 14:26.734
SEXUALLY AROUSED BY FECES.

14:26.734 --> 14:28.300
IT TRULY IS A MAGICAL TIME

14:28.300 --> 14:34.233
TO BE ALIVE.

14:34.233 --> 14:36.033
SO IT SEEMS YET AGAIN, A LARGE

14:36.033 --> 14:36.867
EUROPEAN COUNTRY IS TEETERING ON

14:36.867 --> 14:38.700
THE EDGE OF CHAOS.

14:38.700 --> 14:39.734
IT'S WORTH LOOKING AT THE

14:39.734 --> 14:41.166
ITALIAN ELECTION BECAUSE

14:41.166 --> 14:41.800
EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS

14:41.800 --> 14:42.900
FASCINATING.

14:42.900 --> 14:43.834
AND LET'S BEGIN WITH

14:43.834 --> 14:45.567
THE KEY FIGURES.

14:45.567 --> 14:46.433
FIRST, FORMER PRIME MINISTER

14:46.433 --> 14:49.834
MATTEO RENZI.

14:49.834 --> 14:50.834
HE'S A CENTRIST AND HE HAD TO

14:50.834 --> 14:51.667
RESIGN DRAMATICALLY AFTER MAKING

14:51.667 --> 14:54.467
A BOLD ATTEMPT TO REFORM ITALY'S

14:54.467 --> 14:55.166
POLITICAL SYSTEM,

14:55.166 --> 14:55.967
A REFERENDUM THAT DIDN'T GO WELL

14:55.967 --> 14:58.533
FOR HIM.

14:58.533 --> 15:00.600
>> I LOST AND I SAY IT LOUD

15:00.600 --> 15:01.967
AND CLEAR, EVEN IF I HAVE A LUMP

15:01.967 --> 15:03.333
IN MY THROAT, I WASN'T ABLE

15:03.333 --> 15:06.133
TO WIN.

15:06.133 --> 15:07.433
LONG LIVE ITALY.

15:07.433 --> 15:12.500
AND GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF US.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.233
>> John: WOW, THAT IS OMINOUS.

15:14.233 --> 15:18.033
THAT'S LIKE A PILOT COMING ON

15:18.033 --> 15:19.100
OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER AND SAYING,

15:19.100 --> 15:20.166
"WELL, FOLKS, LOOKS LIKE

15:20.166 --> 15:20.834
OL' CAPTAIN DOUG CAME UP SHORT

15:20.834 --> 15:21.433
THIS TIME.

15:21.433 --> 15:22.300
ANYWAY, SIT BACK, RELAX,

15:22.300 --> 15:25.934
AND GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF US."

15:25.934 --> 15:26.867
I'D SAY THAT WAS RENZI'S MOST

15:26.867 --> 15:29.667
HUMILIATING DEFEAT, BUT THAT

15:29.667 --> 15:30.934
HONOR REALLY HAS TO GO TO HIS

15:30.934 --> 15:35.100
ACTUAL APPEARANCE IN THE

15:35.100 --> 15:36.100
'90s ON ITALY'S "WHEEL OF

15:36.100 --> 15:37.000
FORTUNE."

15:37.000 --> 15:38.367
>> I'D LIKE TO GIVE THE ANSWER.

15:38.367 --> 15:42.033
>> I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT.

15:42.100 --> 15:57.367
>> John: LOOK, IT IS NOT GOOD

15:58.367 --> 16:02.834
WHEN THE HOST IS JOINING IN.

16:02.834 --> 16:04.467
"HEY, I KNOW MY ONLY JOB ON THIS

16:04.467 --> 16:05.433
SHOW IS TO MOVE THINGS ALONG,

16:05.433 --> 16:06.200
BUT THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN!

16:06.200 --> 16:08.200
BOO!

16:08.200 --> 16:09.600
BOO TO YOU!"

16:09.600 --> 16:10.467
RENZI'S ATTEMPTING A COMEBACK

16:10.467 --> 16:11.834
BUT IS FACING AN UPHILL BATTLE,

16:11.834 --> 16:12.600
AS ITALY'S EXPERIENCING A WAVE

16:12.600 --> 16:19.000
OF ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT SENTIMENT.

16:19.000 --> 16:19.400
AND THAT'S ENIRELY

16:19.400 --> 16:20.166
UNDERSTANDABLE.

16:20.166 --> 16:21.033
THE COUNTRY HAS WELL-DOCUMENTED

16:21.033 --> 16:21.867
PROBLEMS WITH CORRUPTION

16:21.867 --> 16:22.533
AND THEIR GOVERNMENT IS FAMOUSLY

16:22.533 --> 16:23.367
GRIDLOCKED.

16:23.367 --> 16:24.000
ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING

16:24.000 --> 16:25.166
PARTIES ATTEMPTING TO HARNESS

16:25.166 --> 16:26.800
THIS ANGER IS FIVE-STAR,

16:26.800 --> 16:28.000
WHICH STARTED JUST EIGHT YEARS

16:28.000 --> 16:30.233
AGO IN A VERY UNUSUAL WAY.

16:30.233 --> 16:31.533
>> HE COMES ONTO STAGE LIKE

16:31.533 --> 16:33.333
A ROCK STAR.

16:33.333 --> 16:38.233
BEPPE GRILLO, COMEDIAN TURNED

16:38.233 --> 16:39.000
FIRE-BREATHING CURSE-FLINGING

16:39.000 --> 16:41.100
CRITIC OF THE STATUS QUO.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.133
GRILLO FOUNDED HIS SO-CALLED

16:42.133 --> 16:43.567
"FIVE STAR" MOVEMENT,

16:43.567 --> 16:45.033
FIRST RAILING ON HIS BLOG AND

16:45.033 --> 16:46.700
MORE RECENTLY IN PIAZZAS ACROSS

16:46.700 --> 16:49.266
THE COUNTRY AGAINST SKY-HIGH

16:49.266 --> 16:51.500
TAXES, ITALY'S LEGENDARY RED

16:51.500 --> 16:53.700
TAPE, CORRUPT POLITICIANS,

16:53.700 --> 16:55.600
GREEDY BUSINESSMEN AND LAZY

16:55.600 --> 16:57.600
BUREAUCRATS.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.367
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT.

16:58.367 --> 16:59.333
FIVE-STAR WAS STARTED BY

16:59.333 --> 17:00.900
A COMEDIAN WHO ORGANIZED

17:00.900 --> 17:02.033
DEMONSTRATIONS CALLED

17:02.033 --> 17:03.767
"VAFFANCULO DAY,"

17:03.767 --> 17:04.934
WHICH TRANSLATES TO

17:04.934 --> 17:07.433
"FUCK OFF DAY,"

17:07.433 --> 17:08.433
WHICH IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY GREAT

17:08.433 --> 17:10.767
IDEA FOR A HOLIDAY.

17:10.767 --> 17:12.300
HALLMARK SHOULD REALLY TAKE THAT

17:12.300 --> 17:13.600
CONCEPT AND RUN WITH IT BECAUSE

17:13.600 --> 17:17.100
I CAN THINK OF A LOT OF PEOPLE

17:17.100 --> 17:19.500
I'D LIKE TO SEND A CARD TO.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.900
NOW, GRILLO HAS SINCE STEPPED

17:20.900 --> 17:22.233
AWAY FROM THE PARTY, AND FIVE

17:22.233 --> 17:24.367
STAR'S CANDIDATE IS

17:24.367 --> 17:26.600
31-YEAR-OLD LUIGI DI MAIO.

17:26.600 --> 17:28.100
AND I'D ARGUE 31 IS A LITTLE

17:28.100 --> 17:29.533
YOUNG TO BE THE LEADER OF

17:29.533 --> 17:31.166
A MAJOR EUROPEAN NATION.

17:31.166 --> 17:32.734
TO GIVE YOU SOME PERSPECTIVE,

17:32.734 --> 17:34.367
DI MAIO IS ONE YEAR YOUNGER

17:34.367 --> 17:37.100
THAN FRANKIE MUNIZ, AND I DON'T

17:37.100 --> 17:39.166
WANT HIM RUNNING ITALY.

17:39.166 --> 17:40.233
I DON'T EVEN WANT HIM RUNNING

17:40.233 --> 17:42.834
HIS OWN TWITTER ACCOUNT.

17:42.834 --> 17:44.166
'CAUSE TWO DAYS AGO, HE TWEETED

17:44.166 --> 17:45.834
"I HAVE A TOOTHACHE."

17:45.834 --> 17:46.633
COME ON, FRANKIE!

17:46.633 --> 17:50.734
SELL YOUR BRAND!

17:50.734 --> 17:51.834
DO BETTER, BOY.

17:51.834 --> 17:52.467
THE POINT IS, WHEN YOU SEE

17:52.467 --> 17:53.633
DI MAIO IN ACTION, HE LIVES UP

17:53.633 --> 17:55.066
TO YOUR WORST ASSUMPTIONS OF

17:55.066 --> 17:56.166
WHAT A 31-YEAR-OLD CANDIDATE

17:56.166 --> 17:59.667
FOR PRIME MINISTER COULD BE.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.600
>> THIS COUNTRY IS WEIGHED DOWN.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.633
PARTIES ARE A WEIGHT,

18:02.633 --> 18:03.266
WITH THEIR CONFLICTS OF

18:03.266 --> 18:05.266
INTEREST.

18:05.266 --> 18:07.367
WE HAVE TO FLY HIGH, BRING THIS

18:07.367 --> 18:09.700
COUNTRY AND MAKE IT FLY HIGH.

18:09.700 --> 18:10.900
AND THIS IS WHY TODAY WE WILL

18:10.900 --> 18:15.533
ACTUALLY FLY!

18:15.600 --> 18:23.567
♪ ♪

18:23.567 --> 18:28.000
>> John: COOL.

18:28.000 --> 18:28.834
ALTHOUGH, THAT'S NOT REALLY

18:28.834 --> 18:30.200
FLYING, IS IT?

18:30.200 --> 18:31.667
TO BE ACCURATE, HE SHOULD HAVE

18:31.667 --> 18:32.767
SAID, "THE COUNTRY IS WEIGHED

18:32.767 --> 18:33.934
DOWN WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST,

18:33.934 --> 18:35.834
SO WE HAVE TO MAKE ITALY

18:35.834 --> 18:37.300
PATHETICALLY HOVER 20 FEET

18:37.300 --> 18:38.200
OFF THE GROUND WHILE SPINNING

18:38.200 --> 18:39.266
IN CIRCLES AND GRIPPING

18:39.266 --> 18:42.000
AN ATTENDANT'S HAND."

18:42.000 --> 18:43.333
AND WHILE THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE

18:43.333 --> 18:44.467
ABOUT SOME OF FIVE STAR'S

18:44.467 --> 18:45.600
POLICIES, THERE'S ALSO A LOT

18:45.600 --> 18:47.467
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT.

18:47.467 --> 18:48.700
BECAUSE WHILE THEY'RE AGAINST

18:48.700 --> 18:54.066
A LOT OF THINGS, IT'S LESS CLEAR

18:54.066 --> 18:55.233
WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY FOR.

18:55.233 --> 18:55.800
AND IN RECENT MONTHS,

18:55.800 --> 18:56.433
THEY'VE SHOWN AN UGLY SIDE,

18:56.433 --> 18:57.033
TAKING AN INCREASINGLY

18:57.033 --> 18:57.633
HARD-LINE STANCE REGARDING

18:57.633 --> 18:58.400
IMMIGRATION, WITH DI MAIO

18:58.400 --> 18:59.333
CRITICIZING SOME RESCUE EFFORTS

18:59.333 --> 19:00.400
IN THE MEDITERRANEAN

19:00.400 --> 19:02.433
AS "SEA-TAXI SERVICES"

19:02.433 --> 19:06.266
THAT MUST END.

19:06.266 --> 19:08.066
SOME PARTY MEMBERS HAVE ENGAGED

19:08.066 --> 19:09.200
IN VACCINE SKEPTICISM, PROPOSING

19:09.200 --> 19:10.333
ROLLING BACK MANDATORY

19:10.333 --> 19:11.500
VACCINATIONS FOR CHILDREN,

19:11.500 --> 19:13.066
WHICH IS PRETTY DANGEROUS,

19:13.066 --> 19:14.533
CONSIDERING ITALY SAW NEARLY

19:14.533 --> 19:16.967
5,000 CASES OF MEASLES,

19:16.967 --> 19:18.200
INCLUDING FOUR DEATHS

19:18.200 --> 19:20.166
JUST LAST YEAR.

19:20.166 --> 19:21.867
AND THAT SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING

19:21.867 --> 19:23.433
IN THIS DAY AND AGE.

19:23.433 --> 19:24.233
IT'S LIKE HEARING FOUR PEOPLE

19:24.233 --> 19:25.500
WERE TRAMPLED TO DEATH

19:25.500 --> 19:27.133
IN LINE AT A BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO.

19:27.133 --> 19:32.400
HOW?

19:32.400 --> 19:33.834
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

19:33.834 --> 19:34.400
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE MOVED

19:34.400 --> 19:35.066
PAST THAT!

19:35.066 --> 19:37.166
NEXT, THERE'S THE LEAGUE,

19:37.166 --> 19:38.467
A FAR-RIGHT PARTY LED BY MATTEO

19:38.467 --> 19:39.900
SALVINI, WHO, INCREDIBLY,

19:39.900 --> 19:41.633
LIKE RENZI, ALSO APPEARED

19:41.633 --> 19:44.567
ON AN ITALIAN GAME SHOW

19:44.567 --> 19:47.300
NOT JUST AS A 12-YEAR-OLD

19:47.300 --> 19:48.266
CHILD BUT ALSO LATER AGAIN

19:48.266 --> 19:48.900
WHEN HE WAS 20,

19:48.900 --> 19:53.667
ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT

19:53.667 --> 19:54.367
AND RACING AROUND

19:54.367 --> 19:55.433
WITH BOXES ON HIS FEET.

19:55.433 --> 19:56.500
AND I DO HOPE YOU ENJOYED THOSE

19:56.500 --> 19:57.333
CLIPS, BECAUSE THAT'S AS LIKABLE

19:57.333 --> 19:59.400
AS SALVINI GETS.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.333
HE'S GROWN UP INTO

20:00.333 --> 20:02.100
A TRULY POISONOUS POLITICIAN.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.266
HE COMPARED THE FEMALE SPEAKER

20:03.266 --> 20:04.233
OF THE HOUSE TO AN INFLATABLE

20:04.233 --> 20:05.300
SEX DOLL.

20:05.300 --> 20:06.834
HE'S TAKEN A HARD LINE

20:06.834 --> 20:08.033
ON IMMIGRATION, SAYING

20:08.033 --> 20:09.667
OUT OF CONTROL IMMIGRATION LEADS

20:09.667 --> 20:11.333
TO DRUG DEALING, RAPE, THEFT,

20:11.333 --> 20:12.700
AND VIOLENCE.

20:12.700 --> 20:13.934
AND HE'S TRAFFICKED IN SOME

20:13.934 --> 20:16.633
PRETTY ALARMING RHETORIC.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.300
>> THERE'S A NEED FOR A MASS

20:18.300 --> 20:19.600
CLEANING, EVEN IN ITALY.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.400
FROM ONE STREET TO THE NEXT,

20:21.400 --> 20:22.767
FROM ONE NEIGHBORHOOD TO THE

20:22.767 --> 20:24.767
NEXT, TOWN SQUARE TO TOWN

20:24.767 --> 20:26.100
SQUARE, WITH STRONG METHODS,

20:26.100 --> 20:27.567
IF NECESSARY.

20:27.567 --> 20:28.867
>> John: WOW.

20:28.867 --> 20:30.467
A MASS CLEANING WITH STRONG

20:30.467 --> 20:31.734
METHODS!

20:31.734 --> 20:32.767
HE SOUNDS LIKE A FASCIST

20:32.767 --> 20:34.700
MARY POPPINS.

20:34.700 --> 20:39.000
SO BASICALLY: MARY POPPINS.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.300
AND THE FRIGHTENING THING IS,

20:40.300 --> 20:41.600
NOT ALL ITALIAN VOTERS

20:41.600 --> 20:43.600
ARE CONCERNED BY SALVINI.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.467
ONE TOLD "THE NEW YORK TIMES,"

20:45.467 --> 20:46.166
"I LIKE HIM BECAUSE HE PUTS

20:46.166 --> 20:48.333
ITALIANS FIRST.

20:48.333 --> 20:50.066
AND I GUESS HE'S A FASCIST, TOO.

20:50.066 --> 20:52.000
WHAT CAN YOU DO?"

20:52.000 --> 20:53.567
TO WHICH THE OBVIOUS ANSWER IS,

20:53.567 --> 20:55.100
"DON'T VOTE FOR HIM!"

20:55.100 --> 20:56.467
THAT'S LITERALLY THE ONLY THING

20:56.467 --> 20:57.300
YOU SHOULD DO.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.667
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING,

20:59.667 --> 21:00.900
"WAIT, I KNOW SOMEONE WHO MIGHT

21:00.900 --> 21:02.367
REALLY HIT IT OFF WITH THIS

21:02.367 --> 21:03.767
GUY," WELL, DON'T WORRY.

21:03.767 --> 21:09.633
OF COURSE, THEY'VE MET.

21:09.633 --> 21:10.667
OF COURSE.

21:10.667 --> 21:11.400
OH, YOU THOUGHT MAYBE TRUMP

21:11.400 --> 21:12.033
WOULDN'T POP UP IN THIS STORY?

21:12.033 --> 21:12.834
THINK AGAIN.

21:12.834 --> 21:13.400
HE'S THE FORREST GUMP

21:13.400 --> 21:17.867
OF HUMAN MISERY.

21:17.867 --> 21:19.767
THIS IS TRUE.

21:19.767 --> 21:22.266
SALVINI MET WITH TRUMP DURING

21:22.266 --> 21:23.333
THE 2016 CAMPAIGN, AND TRUMP

21:23.333 --> 21:25.533
REPORTEDLY TOLD SALVINI THAT HE

21:25.533 --> 21:26.367
HOPED HE WOULD BECOME PRIME

21:26.367 --> 21:29.433
MINISTER OF ITALY SOON.

21:29.433 --> 21:30.767
AND I HOPE THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN,

21:30.767 --> 21:39.533
BECAUSE SALVINI'S PARTY'S

21:39.533 --> 21:41.600
TONE HAS ATTRACTED NASTY

21:41.600 --> 21:42.900
FOLLOWERS.

21:42.900 --> 21:43.734
>> THE FAR-RIGHT SUPPORTER

21:43.734 --> 21:44.734
IN CENTRAL ITALY IS ACCUSED OF

21:44.734 --> 21:45.633
OPENING FIRE ON AFRICAN MIGRANTS

21:45.633 --> 21:46.166
SATURDAY AND WOUNDING

21:46.166 --> 21:47.233
SIX OF THEM.

21:47.233 --> 21:47.867
AFTER THE SHOOTING, HE DROVE IN

21:47.867 --> 21:48.900
FRONT OF A WAR MONUMENT AND MADE

21:48.900 --> 21:49.500
A FASCIST SALUTE WEARING WHAT

21:49.500 --> 21:52.300
LOOKED LIKE AN ITALIAN FLAG.

21:52.300 --> 21:53.800
>> John: NOW, THE MAN IN

21:53.800 --> 21:55.033
QUESTION REPORTEDLY CALLED

21:55.033 --> 21:56.266
SALVINI HIS CAPTAIN, AND WAS ONE

21:56.266 --> 21:57.367
OF THE LEAGUE'S CANDIDATES FOR A

21:57.367 --> 21:58.300
LOCAL ELECTION LAST YEAR,

21:58.300 --> 21:59.166
WHICH IS AWFUL.

21:59.166 --> 21:59.934
ALTHOUGH IT SHOULD BE NOTED

21:59.934 --> 22:00.967
THAT, IN THAT ELECTION,

22:00.967 --> 22:03.533
HE RECEIVED NO VOTES,

22:03.533 --> 22:04.667
WHICH MEANS NOT ONLY DID HIS

22:04.667 --> 22:05.500
FAMILY AND FRIENDS NOT VOTE FOR

22:05.500 --> 22:08.800
HIM.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.467
HE DIDN'T EVEN VOTE FOR HIMSELF!

22:11.467 --> 22:13.000
EVEN IF YOU'RE A RACIST,

22:13.000 --> 22:14.700
MURDEROUS PIECE OF SHIT,

22:14.700 --> 22:16.333
IF YOU RUN FOR ANYTHING,

22:16.333 --> 22:17.834
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST GET ONE

22:17.834 --> 22:20.934
VOTE, OR YOU'RE JUST AN IDIOT.

22:20.934 --> 22:22.333
SO IN THE MIDST OF ECONOMIC

22:22.333 --> 22:23.467
UNCERTAINTY, FAKE NEWS,

22:23.467 --> 22:24.967
AND RACE-BAITING, IT'S CLEAR

22:24.967 --> 22:26.266
THAT WHAT ITALY NEEDS IS SOMEONE

22:26.266 --> 22:27.133
TO STEP UP AND LEAD THEM OUT OF

22:27.133 --> 22:31.567
TROUBLE,

22:31.567 --> 22:32.900
I'M TALKING ABOUT A BOLD NEW

22:32.900 --> 22:33.867
VOICE,

22:33.867 --> 22:35.000
A FRESH LEADER OF TOMORROW.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.300
SHOW US, ITALY, WHO SHALL BE

22:36.300 --> 22:38.567
YOUR KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR?

22:38.567 --> 22:40.900
>> FORZA ITALIA!

22:40.900 --> 22:41.934
FORZA LIBERTA!

22:41.934 --> 22:43.066
>> MANY THOUGHT HE WAS

22:43.066 --> 22:44.934
POLITICALLY FINISHED,

22:44.934 --> 22:46.900
DONE.

22:46.900 --> 22:48.367
BUT SILVIO BERLUSCONI,

22:48.367 --> 22:50.033
ITALY'S FOUR-TIME PRIME

22:50.033 --> 22:53.033
MINISTER, IS MAKING A COMEBACK.

22:53.033 --> 22:54.133
>> John: OH, IT'S TRUE.

22:54.133 --> 22:55.667
HE'S BACK!

22:55.667 --> 22:57.633
SILVIO BERLUSCONI.

22:57.633 --> 22:59.300
SORRY, THAT'S HPV.

22:59.300 --> 23:01.200
SILVIO BERLUSCONI.

23:01.200 --> 23:01.800
SORRY, THAT'S JUST

23:01.800 --> 23:03.066
A CONDOM FILLED WITH

23:03.066 --> 23:04.667
MARINARA SAUCE.

23:04.667 --> 23:06.767
SILVIO BERLUSCONI HAS RETURNED,

23:06.767 --> 23:08.200
AND THE MOST RECENT POLLS

23:08.200 --> 23:08.734
ACTUALLY HAD HIS COALITION

23:08.734 --> 23:11.033
IN THE LEAD.

23:11.033 --> 23:12.200
SO IF ITALY IS SERIOUSLY

23:12.200 --> 23:14.300
CONSIDERING TAKING BERLUSCONI

23:14.300 --> 23:15.633
BACK, IT'S WORTH THE REST OF US

23:15.633 --> 23:16.467
BRUSHING UP ON HIM,

23:16.467 --> 23:18.066
BECAUSE HE IS ONE OF HISTORY'S

23:18.066 --> 23:20.600
MOST LUDICROUS HUMANS.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.734
HIS EGO IS LEGENDARY.

23:21.734 --> 23:31.400
HE ONCE CLAIMED,

23:31.400 --> 23:32.367
"MY GREATNESS IS BEYOND

23:32.367 --> 23:32.934
DISCUSSION.

23:32.934 --> 23:33.867
MY HUMAN SUBSTANCE, MY HISTORY

23:33.867 --> 23:34.433
ARE WHAT OTHERS DREAM OF."

23:34.433 --> 23:35.867
AND IN THE YEARS BERLUSCONI WAS

23:35.867 --> 23:36.500
IN POWER, HE BUILT A QUASI CULT

23:36.500 --> 23:37.367
OF PERSONALITY AROUND HIMSELF,

23:37.367 --> 23:41.266
PERHAPS BEST EXEMPLIFIED BY THIS

23:41.266 --> 23:43.166
CAMPAIGN SONG FROM 2008.

23:43.233 --> 23:57.967
♪ ♪

23:57.967 --> 23:59.367
>> John: THAT HAS TO LITERALLY

23:59.367 --> 24:00.633
BE SILVIO BERLUSCONI'S FANTASY:

24:00.633 --> 24:01.333
A WORLD WHERE HE IS APPARENTLY

24:01.333 --> 24:02.200
THE ONLY MAN LEFT ON EARTH

24:02.200 --> 24:04.934
AND EVERY WOMAN SINGS ABOUT HIM

24:04.934 --> 24:06.433
WHILST FONDLING PRODUCE.

24:06.433 --> 24:07.600
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, WHAT MOST PEOPLE

24:07.600 --> 24:08.400
KNOW ABOUT BERLUSCONI CAN BE

24:08.400 --> 24:09.633
SUMMED UP IN TWO WORDS:

24:09.633 --> 24:11.633
THE WORD "BUNGA" TWICE.

24:11.633 --> 24:13.900
HE FAMOUSLY HOSTED SEX PARTIES

24:13.900 --> 24:15.066
WHICH ALLEGEDLY FEATURED

24:15.066 --> 24:17.834
SCORES OF ORGIES AND

24:17.834 --> 24:18.867
FEMALE GUESTS DRESSED UP

24:18.867 --> 24:20.600
AS NUNS, NURSES,

24:20.600 --> 24:21.667
AND EVEN BARACK OBAMA,

24:21.667 --> 24:22.667
WHICH IS BOTH DEEPLY WEIRD

24:22.667 --> 24:25.266
AND SOMEHOW DEEPLY PROGRESSIVE.

24:25.266 --> 24:26.533
SILVIO BERLUSCONI WOULD LIKE TO

24:26.533 --> 24:28.166
EXPLORE A MIXED-RACE,

24:28.166 --> 24:30.600
QUASI-HOMOSEXUAL EXPERIENCE.

24:30.600 --> 24:33.467
GOOD ON YOU, PIG MONSTER!

24:33.467 --> 24:34.200
BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.233
HE OWNS A STAKE IN TV CHANNELS,

24:36.233 --> 24:36.834
SOME OF WHICH HAVE BROADCAST

24:36.834 --> 24:38.567
SHOWS THAT HAVE BEEN LONG

24:38.567 --> 24:39.533
CRITICIZED FOR THEIR COARSE

24:39.533 --> 24:41.133
CONTENT, INCLUDING LITERALLY

24:41.133 --> 24:42.734
TREATING WOMEN LIKE PIECES OF

24:42.734 --> 24:44.000
MEAT.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.133
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

24:45.133 --> 24:47.333
HE ALSO OWNED A FOOTBALL TEAM,

24:47.333 --> 24:48.734
AC MILAN, BUT COULDN'T EVEN TALK

24:48.734 --> 24:49.834
TO THEIR PLAYERS WITHOUT GETTING

24:49.834 --> 24:51.967
WEIRD.

24:51.967 --> 24:52.800
>> WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO

24:52.800 --> 24:54.100
INTRODUCE ME TO YOUR WIFE?

24:54.100 --> 24:55.166
JUST TO SEE HER.

24:55.166 --> 24:56.300
I'M OLD.

24:56.300 --> 24:58.100
I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE,

24:58.100 --> 24:58.734
BUT BECAUSE EVERYONE SAYS SHE'S

24:58.734 --> 25:03.266
THE PRETTIEST ONE.

25:03.266 --> 25:04.300
>> John: OH, WHAT

25:04.300 --> 25:05.200
A TERRIFIC BOSS!

25:05.200 --> 25:05.900
"HELLO, EMPLOYEE!

25:05.900 --> 25:06.633
WHERE'S YOUR SPOUSE I'D LIKE TO

25:06.633 --> 25:07.467
FUCK?

25:07.467 --> 25:08.066
DON'T WORRY, I'M TOO OLD

25:08.066 --> 25:09.100
TO FUCK HER NOW.

25:09.100 --> 25:10.233
OTHERWISE I WOULD, THOUGH.

25:10.233 --> 25:11.667
WE'RE HAVING FUN, AREN'T WE,

25:11.667 --> 25:14.800
PAID SUBORDINATE?"

25:14.800 --> 25:16.700
WE DO HAVE FUN!

25:16.700 --> 25:18.233
AND THE FACT THAT BERLUSCONI

25:18.233 --> 25:19.600
IS AN IRREPRESSIBLE HORNDOG

25:19.600 --> 25:21.000
IS FUNNY, BUT IT'S WORTH

25:21.000 --> 25:22.133
REMEMBERING THOSE BUNGA-BUNGA

25:22.133 --> 25:23.433
PARTIES ALLEGEDLY FEATURED

25:23.433 --> 25:25.066
A 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHOM

25:25.066 --> 25:26.233
BERLUSCONI PAID FOR SEX.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.600
AND WHEN THE WHOLE SCANDAL

25:27.600 --> 25:28.667
BROKE, HIS RESPONSE WAS LESS

25:28.667 --> 25:33.100
THAN CHARMING.

25:33.166 --> 25:38.333
>> I HAVE ALWAYS WORKED WITH NO

25:38.333 --> 25:39.967
INTERRUPTION AND IF IT SOMETIMES

25:39.967 --> 25:41.000
HAPPENS TO ME TO SEE THE FACE OF

25:41.000 --> 25:42.900
A BEAUTIFUL GIRL, I SAY, "BETTER

25:42.900 --> 25:45.700
TO LIKE GIRLS THAN TO BE GAY."

25:45.700 --> 25:46.800
>> John: THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING

25:46.800 --> 25:47.900
TO SAY, AND IT'S NOT EVEN

25:47.900 --> 25:48.834
CONNECTED TO THE TERRIBLE THING

25:48.834 --> 25:51.033
YOU'RE BEING ACCUSED OF.

25:51.033 --> 25:51.700
HE'S BASICALLY

25:51.700 --> 25:52.333
BERNIE MADOFF SAYING,

25:52.333 --> 25:53.367
"HEY!

25:53.367 --> 25:54.667
BETTER TO BE A COMPLETE CROOK

25:54.667 --> 25:56.200
THAN TO BE PUERTO RICAN."

25:56.200 --> 26:01.367
FUCK YOU, BERNIE.

26:01.367 --> 26:02.033
HOW DID YOU JUST MAKE THIS

26:02.033 --> 26:02.800
WORSE?

26:02.800 --> 26:03.567
AND ON THE WORLD STAGE,

26:03.567 --> 26:04.133
BERLUSCONI'S DIPLOMACY LEFT

26:04.133 --> 26:04.700
A LOT TO BE DESIRED.

26:04.700 --> 26:06.467
HE JOKED MORE THAN ONCE THAT

26:06.467 --> 26:07.433
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS "TANNED,"

26:07.433 --> 26:08.233
AND ALLEGEDLY MADE A COMMENT

26:08.233 --> 26:10.967
ABOUT ANGELA MERKEL

26:10.967 --> 26:11.767
THAT WAS SO CONTROVERSIAL,

26:11.767 --> 26:12.900
HE WAS CONFRONTED ABOUT IT IN AN

26:12.900 --> 26:13.967
INTERVIEW THAT WAS SPECTACULARLY

26:13.967 --> 26:15.633
AWKWARD.

26:15.633 --> 26:16.433
>> DO YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR

26:16.433 --> 26:18.100
PROBLEM WITH ANGELA MERKEL?

26:18.100 --> 26:20.400
IS IT TRUE YOU CALLED HER AN

26:20.400 --> 26:25.100
UNFUCKABLE LARD

26:25.166 --> 26:34.300
>> I WOULD NEVER...

26:34.300 --> 26:35.567
I HAVE NEVER IN...

26:35.567 --> 26:36.934
EXCUSE ME, I HAVE NEVER,

26:36.934 --> 26:38.700
IN 20 YEARS OF POLITICS,

26:38.700 --> 26:40.000
INSULTED ANYBODY.

26:40.000 --> 26:46.500
EVER.

26:46.500 --> 26:47.367
>> John: OH, PLEASE.

26:47.367 --> 26:48.500
YOUR WORDS SAY NO.

26:48.500 --> 26:49.233
BUT YOUR FACE, SILENCE, AND YOUR

26:49.233 --> 26:49.834
HISTORY OF HUMAN INTERACTIONS

26:49.834 --> 26:50.900
SAY "SI."

26:50.900 --> 26:52.533
AND BY THE WAY, SOMEONE WHO

26:52.533 --> 26:53.700
LOOKS LIKE THIS SHOULD NEVER SAY

26:53.700 --> 26:54.333
A THING ABOUT ANYONE ELSE'S

26:54.333 --> 26:56.033
PHYSICAL APPEARANCE.

26:56.033 --> 26:57.934
HE LOOKS LIKE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

26:57.934 --> 26:58.533
IF A SMOKED BRISKET

26:58.533 --> 27:01.533
FUCKED ANDY GARCIA.

27:01.533 --> 27:02.367
BERLUSCONI'S CLOSEST FRIEND

27:02.367 --> 27:03.433
ON THE WORLD STAGE IS,

27:03.433 --> 27:04.633
UNSURPRISINGLY,

27:04.633 --> 27:06.300
VLADIMIR PUTIN.

27:06.300 --> 27:07.834
THEY'RE SO CLOSE, BERLUSCONI

27:07.834 --> 27:09.533
ONCE GAVE PUTIN THIS

27:09.533 --> 27:10.633
ACTUAL BEDSPREAD WITH A PICTURE

27:10.633 --> 27:11.834
OF THEM ON IT,

27:11.834 --> 27:13.400
WHICH ISN'T JUST CREEPY,

27:13.400 --> 27:14.800
IT'S POINTLESS.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.567
WE ALL KNOW PUTIN DOESN'T SLEEP

27:16.567 --> 27:17.934
IN A BED AT NIGHT.

27:17.934 --> 27:19.700
HE JUST SITS IN A CHAIR

27:19.700 --> 27:20.800
AND STARES AT A POTATO

27:20.800 --> 27:24.166
UNTIL IT BAKES.

27:24.166 --> 27:26.033
AND IF YOU THINK HAVING

27:26.033 --> 27:27.934
A BEDSPREAD MADE OF YOU AND YOUR

27:27.934 --> 27:29.066
FRIEND IS CHILDISH, THAT'S

27:29.066 --> 27:30.367
BECAUSE BERLUSCONI IS NOTHING IF

27:30.367 --> 27:32.967
HE'S NOT A GIGANTIC CHILD.

27:32.967 --> 27:34.333
HE EVEN HAD A REMOTE-CONTROLLED

27:34.333 --> 27:36.367
VOLCANO BUILT AT HIS HOUSE,

27:36.367 --> 27:37.867
FEATURING EVERYTHING FROM FIRE

27:37.867 --> 27:39.633
TO ARTIFICIAL EARTH TREMORS.

27:39.633 --> 27:40.667
THIS THING WAS APPARENTLY

27:40.667 --> 27:42.033
EXTREMELY REALISTIC, BECAUSE

27:42.033 --> 27:43.500
AT ONE POINT, BERLUSCONI'S

27:43.500 --> 27:45.066
NEIGHBORS WERE SO ALARMED BY THE

27:45.066 --> 27:46.166
BELCHING FLAMES, THEY CALLED

27:46.166 --> 27:49.200
THE FIRE BRIGADE.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.633
AND I'D LOVE TO SHOW YOU A PHOTO

27:50.633 --> 27:52.367
OF IT, BUT AMAZINGLY

27:52.367 --> 27:54.433
WE CAN'T FIND ONE ANYWHERE,

27:54.433 --> 27:56.467
WHICH IS INSANE, BECAUSE IT'S

27:56.467 --> 27:57.700
NOT LIKE THERE AREN'T HUNDREDS

27:57.700 --> 27:58.600
OF LUDICROUS PHOTOS INVOLVING

27:58.600 --> 28:00.467
BERLUSCONI.

28:00.467 --> 28:01.934
HERE'S ONE OF HIM RECEIVING

28:01.934 --> 28:03.100
A RIFLE FROM GADDAFI.

28:03.100 --> 28:04.433
HERE'S ONE OF HIM AND PUTIN

28:04.433 --> 28:07.166
WEARING MATCHING FURRY HATS.

28:07.166 --> 28:08.333
AND HERE'S ONE OF HIM DRESSED

28:08.333 --> 28:11.266
LIKE PITBULL AT A SLUMBER PARTY.

28:11.266 --> 28:12.700
THE POINT IS, A PHOTO OF

28:12.700 --> 28:14.066
A BELCHING IN-HOME VOLCANO

28:14.066 --> 28:15.100
WOULDN'T EVEN BE IN HIS TOP

28:15.100 --> 28:22.000
THREE WEIRDEST PHOTOS.

28:22.000 --> 28:22.900
BUT WHAT'S EVEN MORE AMAZING

28:22.900 --> 28:23.533
ABOUT BERLUSCONI'S COMEBACK IS

28:23.533 --> 28:24.934
ITALY WAS DONE WITH HIM.

28:24.934 --> 28:25.633
HE LEFT OFFICE AFTER HE WAS

28:25.633 --> 28:26.300
FINALLY CONVICTED OF TAX FRAUD,

28:26.300 --> 28:27.900
AND HIS CONVICTION IN 2013

28:27.900 --> 28:28.467
INCLUDED BANNING HIM FROM

28:28.467 --> 28:29.934
SERVING IN PUBLIC OFFICE

28:29.934 --> 28:31.867
FOR SIX YEARS.

28:31.867 --> 28:35.233
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

28:35.233 --> 28:39.233
2013 PLUS 6 IS 2019.

28:39.233 --> 28:40.600
AND WE CRUNCHED THE NUMBERS ON

28:40.600 --> 28:42.633
THAT ALL WEEK, AND IT TURNS OUT,

28:42.633 --> 28:46.567
THAT'S A YEAR FROM NOW.

28:46.567 --> 28:50.967
STILL BANNED.

28:50.967 --> 28:51.967
HE'S STILL BANNED.

28:51.967 --> 28:52.567
AND YET, HE'S BEEN GOING ON

28:52.567 --> 28:53.433
A CHARM OFFENSIVE, WITH VIDEOS

28:53.433 --> 28:54.133
ONLINE OF HIM EITHER SNUGGLING

28:54.133 --> 28:54.834
ADORABLY WITH A BABY LAMB OR --

28:54.834 --> 28:55.800
BECAUSE IT'S BERLUSCONI --

28:55.800 --> 28:56.967
GETTING TO SECOND BASE WITH AN

28:56.967 --> 28:59.200
INAPPROPRIATELY YOUNG SHEEP.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.834
AND HE'S POSITIONING HIMSELF AS

29:00.834 --> 29:02.400
A KINGMAKER IN THIS ELECTION,

29:02.400 --> 29:05.066
AND MAY WELL END UP HAND-PICKING

29:05.066 --> 29:05.767
THE NEXT LEADER.

29:05.767 --> 29:07.533
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD.

29:07.533 --> 29:09.233
BECAUSE HIS ALLIANCE INCLUDES

29:09.233 --> 29:11.133
MATTEO SALVINI, THE GAME-SHOW

29:11.133 --> 29:12.500
FASCIST FROM EARLIER, WHO COULD

29:12.500 --> 29:13.867
WELL GET A HIGH-POWERED POSITION

29:13.867 --> 29:17.400
IN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.600
SO YOU HAVE TO FEEL FOR ITALY,

29:19.600 --> 29:21.734
BECAUSE THE OUTCOMES DON'T LOOK

29:21.734 --> 29:22.500
GOOD.

29:22.500 --> 29:23.934
THERE ARE A LOT OF BAD OPTIONS,

29:23.934 --> 29:25.333
RANGING FROM AN AWFUL PRIME

29:25.333 --> 29:26.367
MINISTER TO NO OUTRIGHT WINNER,

29:26.367 --> 29:27.066
PLUNGING ITALY INTO POLITICAL

29:27.066 --> 29:29.633
LIMBO.

29:29.633 --> 29:30.800
BUT WAIT, THERE'S ONE MORE

29:30.800 --> 29:31.900
WILD CARD HERE.

29:31.900 --> 29:34.066
UNDER ITALIAN LAW, THE GOVERNING

29:34.066 --> 29:35.633
COALITION, WHOEVER THAT IS,

29:35.633 --> 29:37.300
COULD STILL PICK

29:37.300 --> 29:38.333
A NON-POLITICIAN WHO'S HAD

29:38.333 --> 29:39.700
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS CAMPAIGN

29:39.700 --> 29:40.567
SO FAR.

29:40.567 --> 29:42.367
SO IT COULD BE SOME RANDOM

29:42.367 --> 29:43.633
JACKASS ITALY HAS NEVER HEARD

29:43.633 --> 29:45.900
OF.

29:45.900 --> 29:47.033
AND IF YOU DON'T SEE WHERE

29:47.033 --> 29:54.033
I'M GOING WITH THIS, THEN YOU'VE

29:54.033 --> 29:55.467
CLEARLY NEVER SEEN THIS FUCKING

29:55.467 --> 29:56.200
SHOW BEFORE.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.333
BECAUSE WE ASKED HALF A DOZEN

29:57.333 --> 29:58.000
ITALIAN LEGAL EXPERTS, AND WHILE

29:58.000 --> 29:58.734
THEY TOLD ME I COULDN'T RUN

29:58.734 --> 29:59.533
FOR PRIME MINISTER OF ITALY,

29:59.533 --> 30:00.767
THEY ALSO ADMITTED THERE'S

30:00.767 --> 30:02.266
NO EXPLICIT PROVISION IN THE

30:02.266 --> 30:05.133
ITALIAN CONSTITUTION THAT SAYS

30:05.133 --> 30:05.700
"NON-CITIZENS CAN'T RUN

30:05.700 --> 30:06.834
FOR PRIME MINISTER."

30:06.834 --> 30:10.300
SO, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

30:10.300 --> 30:11.367
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

30:11.367 --> 30:12.700
WE HAVE OURSELVES AN

30:12.700 --> 30:15.400
"AIR BUD" SCENARIO.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.900
REMEMBER, THE RULES OF

30:16.900 --> 30:17.967
BASKETBALL DIDN'T EXPLICITLY

30:17.967 --> 30:19.200
STATE THAT HE COULDN'T PLAY.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.900
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

30:20.900 --> 30:23.066
THE DOG'S DUNKING.

30:23.066 --> 30:25.567
WELL, I AM THAT DOG, ITALY.

30:25.567 --> 30:30.467
SO ALLY-OOP, MOTHERFUCKERS.

30:30.467 --> 30:32.333
BECAUSE I'D ARGUE THAT I'D MAKE

30:32.333 --> 30:33.367
JUST AS GOOD A LEADER AS MANY

30:33.367 --> 30:34.233
OF YOUR POLITICAL FIGURES.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.200
YOU'VE GOT A PARTY STARTED BY

30:35.200 --> 30:39.033
A COMEDIAN?

30:39.033 --> 30:39.633
TECHNICALLY I'M ONE OF

30:39.633 --> 30:40.500
THOSE.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.200
YOU LIKE POLITICIANS WHO APPEAR

30:41.200 --> 30:41.700
ON TV WITH ANIMALS?

30:41.700 --> 30:43.300
PLEASE.

30:43.300 --> 30:46.200
IT'S LIKE JUMANJI UP IN HERE.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.767
SOMEONE BRING ME MY LAMBO!

30:48.767 --> 30:52.600
BRING ME MY LAMBO!

30:52.600 --> 30:54.033
HELLO, BUDDY.

30:54.033 --> 30:55.333

30:56.233 --> 31:00.533

31:00.533 --> 31:01.400
AND THERE'S PLENTY MORE WHERE

31:01.400 --> 31:05.133
THIS CAME FROM.

31:05.133 --> 31:07.467
I HAVE GOT 40 LAMBS BACKSTAGE.

31:07.467 --> 31:11.633
THANK YOU!

31:11.633 --> 31:12.533

31:15.867 --> 31:17.367
SADLY, I HAVEN'T DONE THAT.

31:17.367 --> 31:19.734
HOWEVER, SINCE YOU'RE SWIMMING

31:19.734 --> 31:21.900
IN FAKE NEWS, I SEE NO REASON

31:21.900 --> 31:23.667
NOT TO LIE AND TELL YOU I HAVE.
