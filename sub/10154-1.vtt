00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching on 123Movies.to

00:35.680 --> 00:38.411
<i>It was a dark and stormy night.</i>

00:39.840 --> 00:43.049
<i>The storm was electrical. No rain.</i>

00:43.200 --> 00:45.441
<i>Too bad, because we could use some.</i>

00:55.360 --> 00:56.725
Okay, everybody.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.930
Joke's over. Come on out.

01:07.880 --> 01:12.681
Ian? Ls that you?
I'm pretty vulnerable out here.

01:12.880 --> 01:19.126
I'm just a doe, a deer, a female deer,
out in the woods all alone.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.487
Where are you going, you simple lass?

01:21.680 --> 01:25.002
To check on that noise. I want to
make sure it isn't a scary monster.

01:25.160 --> 01:29.449
Only a buffoon in a horror movie
investigates creepy sounds...

01:29.600 --> 01:31.204
instead of running away.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.643
Now stand back while I investigate
instead of running away.

01:38.800 --> 01:43.044
By those claw marks,
I'd wager that's none other...

01:43.200 --> 01:47.091
than the Wailing Wampus Werewolf.
Hold me.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.370
I thought that was a legend.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.569
Aye, the legend lives!

01:58.440 --> 02:02.126
<i>They needed a hero,
and they were about to get one.</i>

02:02.360 --> 02:03.850
Who can protect us?

02:04.800 --> 02:06.040
I can!

02:08.320 --> 02:10.890
Elliot! You're just in time, lad.

02:11.039 --> 02:14.567
Oh, Elliot. I don't know
how you find the courage.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.405
It comes with being
a Wailing Wampus Werewolf whisperer.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.971
Say that three times fast.

02:19.120 --> 02:22.203
Wailing Wampus Werewolf Whisperer,
Wailing Rumpus Rufleaf Rolips.

02:22.360 --> 02:27.127
Weeling Rimpless Roplips... Ugh, I can't
do it! I'm not as skilled as you.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.601
It's okay, McSquizzy. I'll handle this.

02:29.760 --> 02:33.526
The werewolf communicates
through interpretive dance, and so can I.

02:43.520 --> 02:47.081
Elliot, please be careful.
It's so dangerous.

02:47.240 --> 02:51.928
Danger is my maiden name.
Now, stay here while I defend our home.

02:55.360 --> 02:59.160
There goes the bravest
and most handsomest muledeer...

02:59.360 --> 03:01.328
that ever graced this earth.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.891
Moose pucky!

03:03.280 --> 03:05.760
Your story's a sack of wee jobbies...

03:05.920 --> 03:08.366
you daft tube! SQUIRRELS: Oi!

03:08.520 --> 03:13.003
Who tells a story in black and white
anyways, you jug-eared galoot!

03:13.160 --> 03:15.208
Hello? It's called atmosphere.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.364
Only a complete imbecile
would ever believe...

03:18.520 --> 03:21.729
such a ridiculous story
about a werewolf.

03:21.880 --> 03:25.726
Uh, actually, I find his story
quite convincing.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.082
Thanks, Boog.
I can always count on you.

03:28.240 --> 03:32.006
There was no doubt about it,
that werewolf meant business.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.650
Blood business.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.446
Now, werewolves
aren't like you and me.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.810
Unless you enjoy ripping lungs out of
things. But hey, who am I to judge?

03:41.960 --> 03:45.328
I'm sure there are some perfectly nice
werewolves out there...

03:45.480 --> 03:49.565
just waiting to be friends.
But not this werewolf. Oh, no.

03:49.720 --> 03:52.451
The Wailing Wampus Werewolf
is a different breed.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.888
He stalks the forest,
looking for the biggest...

03:56.040 --> 03:58.850
juiciest tub of lard he can find.

04:04.280 --> 04:08.126
One thing's for sure,
this werewolf wanted to devour me!

04:09.480 --> 04:12.768
- Okay. All right. Time to turn in.
- Aww.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.809
But he was just getting
to the best part.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.611
Yeah, Boog, this is when
I really bring the scares home.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.969
I stood face to face
with the rabid beast.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.009
Oh, you poor deer.

04:26.440 --> 04:31.367
- I could smell its smelly breath.
- Ew. I bet it smelled awful.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.482
Its claws were long and sharp.

04:35.960 --> 04:39.248
Well, you sure can paint a picture,
Elliot. On that note...

04:39.400 --> 04:43.041
There was only one thing sharper than
the werewolf's claws.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.044
Keep it together, Boog.
Come on, go to your happy place.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.009
Its deadly fangs!

04:51.960 --> 04:53.849
He's worse than the bunnies.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.731
Let's take a short intermission.
There's refreshments at the lake.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.929
And by that, I mean you can drink
the lake, which is refreshing.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.730
I'll be right back.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.681
Boog, that was awesome.
You made the story so real.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.411
When you wet yourself,
that really pushed it over the top.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.451
Yeah. Yeah, that's it. I was trying to
help you sell your story.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.450
Thanks to you, that was
the scariest one I told all week.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.604
These werewolf stories
aren't actually true. Are they?

05:26.800 --> 05:29.121
- You have nothing to worry about.
- Ah...

05:29.280 --> 05:30.406
They're absolutely true.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.524
The Wailing Wampus Werewolf is real
and ready to pounce.

05:33.680 --> 05:38.083
- That's what I was worried about.
- Wait a minute. You're actually afraid.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.925
- Am not.
- Am too.

05:41.080 --> 05:44.402
- Am not.
- Am too, am too, am too, am too.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.891
Am not?

05:47.200 --> 05:48.884
All right. I'm afraid. Happy now?

05:49.040 --> 05:52.886
Aha! I knew it!
Wait, what are you afraid of?

05:54.080 --> 05:58.244
Listen, I didn't grow up in the woods.
I lived in a cozy garage, remember?

05:58.760 --> 06:01.366
<i>I had a comfy bed
with my own blanky.</i>

06:01.520 --> 06:05.445
<i>A bowl with my name on it, I think.
Fishy crackers.</i>

06:05.600 --> 06:07.887
<i>And</i> Wheel <i>of Fortune on TV.</i>

06:08.560 --> 06:12.963
Hey, is that a unicycle?
You got the best flashbacks, Boog.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.088
Point is, I was safe.

06:15.240 --> 06:19.529
You'll be fine. You're the fattest animal
in the forest.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.842
That's why the werewolf
will come for me first.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.685
I'm its main competition.
I've gotta get away.

06:24.840 --> 06:28.367
You are getting away. We're
going on that camping trip. Remember?

06:28.520 --> 06:31.205
I am not going camping
with a monster out there.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.728
You can't bail on this trip.
We've been planning it for three years.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.326
Think of the river rafting.
The boogie boards!

06:37.480 --> 06:39.721
Perfect for a guy named Boog.
Zip lines!

06:39.920 --> 06:42.685
Snorkeling. Parasailing.
It'll be relaxing.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.360
You expect me to relax
when a werewolf is after me?

06:45.520 --> 06:47.124
But you promised you'd go.

06:47.280 --> 06:50.966
And when you make a promise to
a friend, that's a promise to the end.

06:54.080 --> 06:58.881
Because you never ever abandon
your friend. Everyone knows that.

06:59.040 --> 07:02.567
I'm sorry, Elliot. I can't.
I'm gonna build a panic room...

07:02.720 --> 07:04.961
and hide until the werewolf
dies from old age.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.690
So what's a panic room?

07:06.840 --> 07:10.322
It's a safe place you can lock yourself
into to keep the werewolves out.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.563
First, you dig a hole.
Say this acorn is me...

07:13.720 --> 07:16.007
and this ladybug is the werewolf.

07:16.200 --> 07:19.886
So the ladybug tries to eat me, see?
But she can't.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.686
So you're afraid of ladybugs too?

07:22.840 --> 07:24.649
Therapy,

07:25.320 --> 07:30.804
I, Elliot Deer Esquire Junior the Third,
nee Danger, am hereby making it...

07:30.960 --> 07:32.769
my mission to help you overcome...

07:32.920 --> 07:36.447
- your fear of the werewolf and ladybugs.
- Please don't do anything.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.166
Don't worry, Boog.
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

07:39.320 --> 07:44.042
Something bad has happened!
Something really, really bad!

07:44.200 --> 07:45.920
- Mr. Weenie!
- What are you doing out here?

07:45.960 --> 07:47.769
- Is it the werewolf?
- Worse!

07:47.920 --> 07:50.082
My beloved owner Bobbie is gone.

07:50.280 --> 07:53.090
So is Bob, who I get along with
but I'm not as close to.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.647
- What happened?
- I woke up in the RV...

07:55.800 --> 07:57.086
and they were not there.

07:57.240 --> 08:00.881
- I will obviously never see them again.
- Maybe they went on a trip.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.162
Or maybe the Wailing Wampus Werewolf
got them.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.560
You're really not helping.

08:04.720 --> 08:09.282
The unihorn is right. That has to be it.
There can be no other explanation.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.408
Don't worry.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

08:11.560 --> 08:15.645
We'll take out that bloodthirsty,
impossibly large and vicious...

08:15.800 --> 08:18.326
werewolf,
and then we'll go on that camping trip.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.801
See you in the morning, Boogster.
Sweet dreams.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.125
- Elliot?
- Yeah, Boog?

08:23.280 --> 08:25.760
Don't tell anyone
I'm afraid of the werewolf.

08:25.920 --> 08:30.403
Don't worry. We're speaking
in the pine cone of silence.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.282
Guess what, everybody,
Boog is afraid of the werewolf!

08:36.440 --> 08:38.408
You mean that was not an act?

08:38.559 --> 08:41.881
- Nope. He's genuinely terrified.
- Your stories aren't even true.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.401
What? How can you say that?
They're totally true.

08:44.560 --> 08:47.086
You've never even seen
this so-called werewolf.

08:47.240 --> 08:50.722
I've never seen my so-called brain,
but I'm pretty sure I've got one.

08:50.920 --> 08:54.925
If you ask me, I saw this coming
a long time ago.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.924
I knew that bear
couldn't hack it out here.

08:58.080 --> 09:03.484
He's more like an em-bear-assment.
Get it? Em-bear-assment. Ha, ha!

09:03.640 --> 09:05.802
Go easy on Boog.
We all have our fears.

09:05.960 --> 09:09.521
- Ah! McSquizzy fears nothing!
- See what I mean?

09:09.680 --> 09:12.650
And, Maria, you're afraid you're never
gonna find someone...

09:12.800 --> 09:15.406
that you'll end up a spinster
living with two pet bobcats.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.928
Actually I wasn't afraid of that,
until now.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.566
Mr. Weenie, you're afraid of
hot dog buns.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.451
Yeah, and pickle relish. And mustard!

09:24.600 --> 09:26.409
Serge, you're afraid of duct tape.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.801
Reilly, you're afraid of splinters.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.288
And, Buddy, balloons scare
the quills off of you.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.090
Balloons.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.490
And I'm afraid of whatever crazy thing
you're gonna do...

09:40.680 --> 09:42.250
to help Boog overcome his fear.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.004
You see, even Giselle is afraid.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.561
- But I've got a brilliant plan.
- Ugh.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.530
- It involves all of us.
- Here we go.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.001
We're gonna scare the fear
out of Boog.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.561
Uh, and how exactly
are we gonna do that?

09:54.720 --> 09:57.405
Here's the plan.
Ian, you're gonna be the star.

09:57.560 --> 09:58.607
Naturally.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.922
We'll take some skunks,
throw in some ducks...

10:08.400 --> 10:14.601
Beth! Dinkelman! We're home! It was all
just a real long bad dream!

10:14.800 --> 10:19.601
Oh, Beth, I'm so glad to see you! I knew
you would never dump me in the woods.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.326
Beth?

10:32.280 --> 10:33.441
Nightmare.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.646
Oh.

10:39.880 --> 10:42.804
- Boo!
- Aah! Are you trying to scare me?

10:42.960 --> 10:46.806
I was trying to say your name, but you
jumped before I got to the "guh" sound.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.480
Boo-guh. You're so impatient.

10:49.640 --> 10:50.971
I'm really not in the mood.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.361
I've got something
that will make you happy.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.363
- Woo-hoo.
- Where'd you find that?

10:55.520 --> 10:58.649
My main bear, Dinkelman.
Actually, you're my main bear.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.047
Dinkelman's my second main bear.
Smokey's my third.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.326
Uh...

11:02.480 --> 11:05.211
Aww. Do you want your baby doll back?

11:08.120 --> 11:09.849
No one touches my Dinkelman.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.609
Hey! That was my last one.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.882
Lucky for you, a little bird told me
a new shipment of Woo-Hoo bars...

11:21.040 --> 11:23.884
came into town. You've met Jerry, right?
The little bird?

11:24.040 --> 11:27.522
We can't go into town, the trail
will expose us to the werewolf.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.730
- Not if we take the shortcut.
- Shortcut?

11:30.880 --> 11:32.370
Yep. The shortcut.

11:34.920 --> 11:38.129
- Well, that looks nice.
- Yeah, we're going over there.

11:41.280 --> 11:45.205
- Through Dead Bear Gulch?
- Ls there a problem?

11:45.360 --> 11:50.082
I'm a bear. Also, I'm a bear!
I don't want to die.

11:50.240 --> 11:54.882
All bears die. Some bears never live.
Let's get you into that gulch.

11:55.040 --> 11:59.807
No way. Nothing good ever happens
in a gulch, especially not in that one.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.281
Boog, I got your back, and your front.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.442
Cootchie-cootchie-coo.
You're totally covered.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.170
Uh, I don't know.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.210
If not for me,
then do it for Woo-Know-Hoo.

12:10.560 --> 12:14.645
Oh, man! Why can't I follow my instincts
instead of my nose?

12:15.520 --> 12:19.286
Wait, you can't leave.
What if I never see you again?

12:19.520 --> 12:20.965
We're only going to town.

12:21.120 --> 12:25.091
That's what Bobbie told me just before
she was eaten by a werewolf.

12:25.240 --> 12:28.130
If it makes you feel any better,
you can hang with us, Mr. Weenie.

12:28.280 --> 12:32.171
Oh, joyful day!
My good luck has returned at last.

12:42.120 --> 12:46.444
Come on, tree huggers!
That tree is not part of the tour.

12:46.640 --> 12:51.089
Lap it up, granola buffs.
Here's nature in all its gory.

12:51.280 --> 12:55.490
Oops. I mean glory.
Trees and this thing.

12:55.640 --> 12:56.880
Ooh. Awesome.

12:58.760 --> 13:02.765
Mr. Shaw? Exactly how long
have you been a nature guide?

13:02.920 --> 13:07.130
Too long. Ever since they declared
open season illegal...

13:07.280 --> 13:10.489
I've had to find another use
for my unique talents.

13:10.680 --> 13:15.322
Good news is, as a nature guide,
I can still shoot whatever I see...

13:15.840 --> 13:18.286
- Oh, no!
- With a camera.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.250
Oh, what a cute camera.

13:22.760 --> 13:27.288
Take a gander, boys and girls.
We've arrived at Dead Bear Gulch.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.163
- I've heard it's haunted.
- Me too.

13:31.320 --> 13:34.290
Isn't this where the Wailing
Wampus Werewolf was last sighted?

13:34.440 --> 13:37.649
There's no werewolf down there.
That's crazy talk.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.282
A rumor propagated by the animals
to distract us...

13:41.440 --> 13:44.284
from their overall plan
of world domination.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.887
Um, okay.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.841
Well, let's get those sandals
flip-flopping.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.049
If you're lucky, maybe we'll see a bird
or something.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.771
If you're really lucky,
maybe it'll be dead.

14:03.720 --> 14:06.803
What did I tell you, Boog?
It's not so scary here.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.321
Sure, there's spooky mist.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.606
Die.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.482
Bottomless pits that lead to
the bowels of the earth.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.209
I said "bottomless" and "bowels"
in the same sentence.

14:19.440 --> 14:22.125
And evil, dead trees
that have "kill" on their minds.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.567
- Aah!
- But on the whole, it's quite pleasant.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.368
Excuse me one moment.
I think I hear my mom calling.

14:30.720 --> 14:33.200
He's coming!
Let's scare the fear out of him.

14:33.360 --> 14:37.081
Just like in rehearsal.
Places, everyone. And action!

14:38.360 --> 14:41.250
False alarm. It wasn't my morn.
It was just gas.

14:43.560 --> 14:46.291
- What's that?
- I'm sorry.

14:46.440 --> 14:50.968
That was my stomach. Without Bobbie
to feed me, I'm so very hungry.

14:51.160 --> 14:54.403
See? Nothing to worry about.
It's just Mr. Weenie starving.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.882
- I'm pretty scared here.
- I wouldn't exactly call you "pretty."

14:58.080 --> 14:59.570
This place gives me the creeps!

14:59.720 --> 15:03.122
Ruggedly handsome, maybe,
but definitely not pretty.

15:03.440 --> 15:09.243
What's that? A vampire bat!
An extinct Tyrannosaurus Rex!

15:09.400 --> 15:12.688
Such teeny arms,
how does he comb his hair?

15:13.760 --> 15:16.161
That's the scariest thing I've ever seen!

15:17.880 --> 15:19.245
Let's get out of here!

15:19.400 --> 15:24.930
No, Boog, face your fear. You look it
in the eye and say, "I'm a grizzly bear!"

15:25.080 --> 15:27.321
- And then you roar!
- Roar?

15:28.640 --> 15:34.443
A spider! The Eiffel Tower! A cow.
A chicken. Bunny and doggie.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.647
Sailor's knot.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.280
Oh, bad idea.

15:39.200 --> 15:43.410
Huh. Your roar worked. The shadows
are gone. Now's our chance. Hurry!

15:43.560 --> 15:45.881
You did it, Boog. You faced your fear.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.646
You can face anything now,
including a werewolf.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.241
- Now can we go on that camping trip?
- No way!

15:51.400 --> 15:53.880
I just added more to
my list of things that scare me.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.089
Evil rock shadows
and zombie skeletons!

15:57.680 --> 15:59.364
- Achtung, baby!
- Gesundheit.

15:59.560 --> 16:02.689
- I'm out of here!
- Hold on. Be brave. We can beat it.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.161
But how can we beat something
that's already dead?

16:05.360 --> 16:08.011
Face your fear with your face,
and your eyeballs.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.041
Elliot wanted us
to move like a skeleton.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.322
I'm doing the skeleton dance.

16:14.480 --> 16:17.131
Skeletons don't shake their hips
like they're trying to get a date.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.760
Ha! Like you know
anything about getting a date.

16:19.920 --> 16:24.801
- Why you gotta be like that?
- Whoa! Well, this stinks.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.924
What did I tell you? We beat it!
Still scared?

16:28.080 --> 16:29.127
More than ever.

16:29.280 --> 16:33.410
If something happens to me, I want you
to have my adorable sweaters.

16:33.560 --> 16:37.167
- Oh, come on. Chin up, guys.
- We don't have chins.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.607
- Sure we do. Right here.
- That's a muzzle.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.003
- It's a chin. See how I rub it?
- Mine is a snout.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.731
Forget the chins.
We've got courage and strength.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.850
If the werewolf himself appeared,
you'd scare him away too.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.765
- Wanna bet?
- Great idea. I'll summon the werewolf.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.127
- No, no, no.
- If I win the bet, we go camping.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.891
- If I win the bet, we get eaten.
- Deal.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.047
Do you have to tinkle?

17:01.200 --> 17:04.204
I'm performing the Wailing
Wampus Werewolf dance.

17:04.359 --> 17:08.523
♪ Wampus wailing walla-walla
Wampus wailing chimi changa ♪

17:08.680 --> 17:10.921
♪ Wampus wailing walla-walla ♪

17:11.079 --> 17:12.444
That's my cue.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.522
Yeah, I don't think you should do this.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.564
You don't think I've got the chops
to scare that bear?

17:17.760 --> 17:21.162
You don't even look like a monster.
You look like a deer covered in moss.

17:21.319 --> 17:23.128
It's all about the performance.

17:23.280 --> 17:27.922
Trust me, Boog will be so petrified
he'll forget he's scared.

17:28.079 --> 17:31.766
- Wolfie, Wolfie. Where's Wolfie?
- I don't want any part of this.

17:31.920 --> 17:36.209
Your loss. Time for the maestro
to work his magic.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.446
It's working.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.647
♪ Wampus wailing ♪

17:49.880 --> 17:54.329
I can't see! Give me something soft. Oh.

17:54.960 --> 17:56.644
Aah! BUDDY: Buddy.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.808
Mr. Weenie, tell me
that was your stomach.

17:58.960 --> 18:02.487
That was not my stomach,
but I am still starving.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.569
You don't have a burrito on you?

18:04.720 --> 18:06.085
Quiet. It's here.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.488
- Aah!
- Wait a minute.

18:10.640 --> 18:14.167
That's not Ian.
That's the real werewolf. Run!

18:24.440 --> 18:26.442
Ouch. That's gonna leave a mark.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.084
What in the name
of Uncle Sam's striped pajamas?

18:36.400 --> 18:40.405
- It's the werewolf!
- It's not a legend. Give me my gun!

18:41.800 --> 18:43.211
Ugh!

18:50.320 --> 18:53.005
The Wailing Wampus Werewolf.

18:53.160 --> 18:57.370
It's real. It's real.

19:00.240 --> 19:05.371
The Wailing Wampus Werewolf! It's real!
It's real! That was amazing!

19:05.520 --> 19:09.605
No, it wasn't. I thought I was gonna die.
I'm hyperventilating.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.001
Anybody got a paper bag
I can breathe into?

19:12.160 --> 19:14.561
Perhaps one of my scented
doodie bags will do?

19:14.720 --> 19:16.563
- Uh, no thank you.
- At least we're safe!

19:20.320 --> 19:23.563
Hey, what's a car doing
on this paved deer trail?

19:23.760 --> 19:25.171
I just thought of something.

19:25.320 --> 19:27.891
Excuse me one moment.
I need a word with Mr. Weenie.

19:28.200 --> 19:32.171
Whoa! We faked the werewolf,
but it's real!

19:32.320 --> 19:36.211
If Boog can overcome his fear of a real
werewolf, he's sure to be brave enough...

19:36.400 --> 19:38.528
to go on that special camping trip
with me!

19:38.680 --> 19:41.047
It's not fake! It's not fake!

19:41.240 --> 19:43.208
- What's not fake?
- The werewolf!

19:43.360 --> 19:46.967
- You mean it was fake before?
- No. It wasn't fake before.

19:47.160 --> 19:50.369
But now it's really not fake!
We'd better hurry.

19:50.520 --> 19:53.364
We've got an appointment with some
Woo-Hoo bars in Timberline!

19:53.520 --> 19:57.730
Isn't it great how near-death experiences
make you feel so alive?

19:57.920 --> 20:02.050
Maybe I would appreciate near death
more if I wasn't so hungry.

20:02.200 --> 20:06.649
Look at us. Walking around, not dead.
High five. Or high three in my case.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.722
How could you put me
in danger like that?

20:09.880 --> 20:11.928
You're supposed to be my best friend.

20:12.280 --> 20:17.047
Best friend?
You've never said that out loud.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.851
Hold on, I've got something in my eye.

20:21.760 --> 20:23.808
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.443
False alarm, it's just sweat.

20:28.320 --> 20:31.802
Now that we're officially best friends,
we should have our own theme song.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.207
- Elliot and Boog.
- And Mr. Weenie.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.522
♪ Elliot and Boog and Mr. Weenie ♪

20:36.680 --> 20:38.921

20:39.080 --> 20:41.481
♪ Oh, Elliot is smart
And Boog is all heart ♪

20:41.640 --> 20:43.881
♪ And Weenie's legs
Are so very teeny ♪

20:44.040 --> 20:47.487
I've gotta be honest,
the Mr. Weenie part feels a little forced.

20:48.920 --> 20:52.288
Boog, if I may be so bold, perhaps
I could be your new best friend.

20:52.480 --> 20:55.802
Of course this means you would
have to feed me and rub my belly.

20:55.960 --> 20:58.930
- What is your stance on neutering?
- You or me?

21:07.760 --> 21:10.366
- It's Shaw.
- On the deer trail.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.648
Just when this day
couldn't get any worse.

21:12.800 --> 21:16.168
He can't do anything to us.
It's against the law now, remember?

21:21.520 --> 21:27.289
Huh. Laugh it up, tick magnet.
I'll be seeing you. Real soon.

21:35.680 --> 21:39.924
- That went well.
- No, Shaw's up to something.

21:40.080 --> 21:41.525
We better find out what.

21:47.040 --> 21:52.080
Okay! The meeting is called to order.
Marcia, you have an announcement?

21:52.320 --> 21:54.243
Thank you, Sheriff Gordy.

21:54.400 --> 21:58.041
We're having a bake sale to raise money
to repaint the school bus.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.323
Make it stop!

22:07.080 --> 22:10.323
Y'all know me.
You know how I earn a living.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.323
Yeah, you're the tour guide.

22:12.480 --> 22:16.007
Before that I was a hunter.
Best there ever was.

22:16.160 --> 22:19.130
And now there's something
in them woods that needs hunting.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.931
Spotted it just outside of
Dead Bear Gulch.

22:22.120 --> 22:23.201
Ooh.

22:23.400 --> 22:28.645
It was none other than
the Wailing Wampus Werewolf.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.446
There's no such thing as werewolves.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.204
Settle down, everybody.

22:33.360 --> 22:36.887
I'll catch this beast for you,
but it ain't gonna be easy.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.844
He doesn't even have any evidence.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.281
You mean besides
this massive head wound?

22:42.160 --> 22:46.370
Oh, I've got evidence.
Everybody here is in danger.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.841
- Why are you on top?
- Because I'm taller.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.004
- Makes sense. Unh!
- Keep still.

22:52.280 --> 22:53.361
What are they saying?

22:53.520 --> 22:58.287
I don't know. I can't read lips, or books,
or anything, really. I'm a bear.

22:58.480 --> 23:01.245
Hmm. I'm going in. Oh!

23:01.920 --> 23:06.164
As soon as I get out from
under your butt area. Please.

23:06.560 --> 23:10.724
Anything like this.
You wanted evidence. Behold.

23:14.120 --> 23:15.804
But it's so small.

23:15.960 --> 23:20.249
You moron. This isn't life size.
This thing is huge!

23:21.920 --> 23:28.121
This monster has got fury in its eye
and hunger in its belly.

23:28.280 --> 23:31.170
Belly hunger?
That's the worst kind of hunger.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.446
Whoa! Whoa!

23:33.720 --> 23:35.290
Hold still, Will you?

23:35.440 --> 23:40.162
Oh, my apologies. I'm so weak from
the hunger I could eat this rope.

23:40.400 --> 23:43.802
Mm. Delicious rope. Ooh.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.081
Mm.

23:45.280 --> 23:48.170
Huh. I don't see
anything conclusive here, Shaw.

23:48.360 --> 23:52.729
Thought you might not, sheriff,
which is why I drew a detailed sketch.

23:55.360 --> 23:58.409
I was skeptical of werewolves
until I saw the drawing.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.648
Dude can draw.

24:00.800 --> 24:04.521
Mm. The end of the rope
is the most delicious part!

24:04.960 --> 24:07.167
Aah! Mr. Weenie, bad dog.

24:07.320 --> 24:12.406
The werewolf wants to destroy you,
your family, your way of life.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.289
This is the worst PTA meeting ever.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.491
Ooh. This rope is good!

24:22.920 --> 24:24.570
Although it could use some salt.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.644
Hey! Let go!

24:26.800 --> 24:30.202
You've gotta let me go out there
armed to catch this thing.

24:30.400 --> 24:34.371
- You mean you want me to...
- Reopen open season.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.609
Open season? Whoa!

24:40.600 --> 24:41.647
The werewolf!

24:42.960 --> 24:46.328
Mr. Weenie! Drop it! Sit. Stay. Heel!

24:54.560 --> 24:56.688
Huh. Werewolf footprints.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.842
The werewolf's been eavesdropping.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.646
Sheriff, you know what you have to do.

25:05.920 --> 25:10.084
Better safe than
ripped to sorry shreds by a werewolf.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.968
Come on, sheriff,
reopen open season...

25:14.120 --> 25:16.646
and let the tour guide
hunt down the werewolf!

25:18.360 --> 25:21.762
Okay. Open season is reopened.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.207
You've made the right decision.

25:24.360 --> 25:29.002
Gordy, what are you doing?
Oh, no! Open season?

25:29.160 --> 25:34.041
Shaw, only the werewolf. You're not
to touch anything else in that forest.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.727
Sure thing, sheriff.
I will only shoot the werewolf.

25:38.560 --> 25:41.643
And anything that
gets in between me and the werewolf...

25:41.800 --> 25:44.565
like, say, a bear or a deer.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.005
We gotta warn the others!

25:52.320 --> 25:53.606
Unh!

25:55.320 --> 25:58.608
I guess things can get worse.
Now Shaw is after us.

25:58.760 --> 26:02.526
While Shaw did not specifically mention
coming after Mr. Weenie...

26:02.680 --> 26:06.082
I stand with you.
I've got nowhere else to go!

26:08.080 --> 26:10.208
Hey, wait up for Mr. Weenie!

26:11.160 --> 26:13.128
Deer tick! I think I got a deer tick.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.681
You can never be
too careful these days...

26:15.880 --> 26:19.282
what with Lyme disease
and everything. No, guess I'm clean.

26:19.440 --> 26:21.283
You know, I've been thinking.

26:21.440 --> 26:25.126
I've been talking about the werewolf
and suddenly it's everywhere.

26:25.280 --> 26:29.808
What if...? Hmm. Pine trees,
pine trees, pine trees.

26:31.000 --> 26:36.166
No way! I say it and I see it.
Rocks. Aah!

26:37.120 --> 26:41.921
I shall call this power The See-cret
and use it responsibly.

26:42.120 --> 26:45.602
Focus. We got a Shaw problem,
and a werewolf problem.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.250
So we've only got two problems.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.289
- Piece of cake.
- I like cake!

26:49.440 --> 26:51.761
But both these two problems
can kill us.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.440
If you could stop the werewolf
and stop open season...

26:54.600 --> 26:57.171
I'd gladly go on
that special camping trip with you.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.209
- Yes!
- But you can't.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.522
- No.
- Maybe we should build that panic room...

27:01.720 --> 27:03.927
where hunters
and werewolves can't get in.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.844
Somewhere we can both safely hide.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.607
Don't forget about Mr. Weenie.
I too would like to safely hide.

27:09.760 --> 27:12.764
We're not hiding. We're gonna
catch this werewolf ourselves.

27:12.920 --> 27:14.331
That's too dangerous.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.130
Everyone is counting on us, Boog.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.926
We've gotta take care of the werewolf
to get rid of Shaw.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.969
What do you mean "we"?

27:21.160 --> 27:24.323
- Have I ever let anything happen to you?
- Yes.

27:24.480 --> 27:29.008
Okay, so our adventures are messy,
they're unpredictable, wild.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.242
But we usually survive. Don't we?

27:31.400 --> 27:32.606
We do.

27:32.760 --> 27:36.082
I won't let anything happen to you
this time and that's a promise.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.685
- Why?
- Why?

27:37.880 --> 27:41.930
Because friends are always there
for each other. Now, repeat after me.

27:42.080 --> 27:44.845
"I'm Boog and I'm a brave bear."

27:45.000 --> 27:47.970
"I'm Boog and I'm a brave bear."

27:48.120 --> 27:50.168
- Are you with me?
- I'm with you.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.322
- Me too!
- Excellent.

27:52.520 --> 27:56.206
Now let's get back and warn the others
about Shaw and the werewolf.

28:03.960 --> 28:05.610
Whoops.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.446
Mm-hm.

28:22.840 --> 28:29.291
Sweetheart, Daddy's home.
Wakey, wakey. Time to get up.

28:32.280 --> 28:34.681
Hello, Lorraine. Mwah.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.161
I know you've been holed up here
too long. Heh.

28:37.360 --> 28:39.681
Probably going half out of your mind.
Mwah.

28:39.840 --> 28:43.731
But your interminable wait
is finally commencing to be over.

28:43.880 --> 28:49.205
You and me are going out!
Open season is back on, babycakes!

28:49.360 --> 28:52.125
We're painting the town red.

28:55.160 --> 28:59.370
<i>Come on down to Ed and Edna's
Poutine Palace!</i>

28:59.520 --> 29:04.481
<i>Home of the Big Curd.
Hey, Ed. What's Poutine?</i>

29:04.680 --> 29:07.809
<i>Funny you should ask, Edna.
First, you take french fries...</i>

29:09.200 --> 29:12.886
<i>Dump boiling gravy on them.
Aah! Boiling gravy!</i>

29:13.040 --> 29:16.601
<i>Then plop in some curds,
and viola! Poutine.</i>

29:16.960 --> 29:19.201
<i>With one convenient location!</i>

29:19.400 --> 29:22.210
<i>Right on Highway 7,
next to the big tree.</i>

29:22.400 --> 29:25.882
<i>"Plenty of free parking!
So come on down."</i>

29:26.040 --> 29:28.884
<i>Or up, depending on
where you start from, eh? Heh, heh.</i>

29:29.040 --> 29:34.285
♪ To Ed and Edna's Poutine Palace
Curds fit for a king ♪

29:34.440 --> 29:36.090
Or a queen!

29:37.480 --> 29:39.005
Nice commercial, Ed.

29:39.160 --> 29:42.289
Now, if that don't get them
busting down our door, nothing will.

29:47.080 --> 29:49.731
- Ooh, that was fast!
- The power of advertising!

29:49.880 --> 29:53.885
- Howdy, Ed and Edna!
- Ooh, Shaw. Good day, eh?

29:54.040 --> 29:57.522
Hey, you haven't lived till you've tried
our Poutine on the ritz.

29:57.680 --> 30:00.809
Save your curds.
We're getting the band back together.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.361
Ah, no way, eh. You're in a band?

30:03.520 --> 30:05.807
I can play a mean accordion
if you're interested.

30:05.960 --> 30:08.201
Open season is open again.

30:08.360 --> 30:11.807
We've got a monster to hunt,
and whatever else gets in our way.

30:11.960 --> 30:17.000
Oh, boy, I've been
waiting for this moment, don't you know?

30:21.840 --> 30:25.287
Hey, Ian, didn't see you out in Dead Bear
Gulch in your werewolf disguise.

30:25.440 --> 30:28.205
Stage fright, right? You should
do what I do and imagine...

30:28.360 --> 30:30.169
the audience are
in their underwear.

30:30.320 --> 30:33.688
I guess it didn't matter anyway
since the real werewolf showed up.

30:33.840 --> 30:36.366
Hello, everybody. We got some news.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.528
Slow down, Boog. Let me handle this.

30:38.680 --> 30:41.889
We've got some news.
I've got bad news and bad news.

30:42.040 --> 30:45.010
- What do you want to hear first?
- The bad news?

30:46.960 --> 30:49.884
- Tell them.
- I was pausing for dramatic effect.

30:50.040 --> 30:54.011
- Open season is open again.
- Shaw is back in action.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.446
- Ooh.
- What's the bad news?

31:00.600 --> 31:04.366
There really is a Wailing
Wampus Werewolf in our wilderness.

31:04.520 --> 31:09.481
There's no werewolf. That's just
a big fat lie you told to try to scare us.

31:09.680 --> 31:11.921
He's the fat one. But here's my proof.

31:12.080 --> 31:15.050
Check out Shaw's
detailed masterpiece.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.767
Oh! That thing looks horrible!

31:18.920 --> 31:21.287
Shaw is a rather gifted artist,
I must say.

31:21.480 --> 31:25.121
- Is there any good news?
- Yes. I'm on the case.

31:25.320 --> 31:28.881
He asked if there was good news,
not the worst news ever.

31:29.040 --> 31:30.690
- Oi!
- Another mess...

31:30.840 --> 31:34.640
caused by you
and your bonky interpretive dances.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.882
When have my dances
ever caused a problem?

31:37.080 --> 31:38.206
Lightning dance!

31:42.320 --> 31:44.368
- Mud slide dance!
- Aah!

31:44.760 --> 31:46.330
Avalanche dance!

31:49.480 --> 31:51.005
You have to stop dancing.

31:51.160 --> 31:53.686
Especially the ones
named after natural disasters.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.411
This is all your fault, Smelliot.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.967
Did you hear that?
I just called him "Smelliot."

31:59.120 --> 32:01.248
Don't worry, guys. I'll make things right.

32:01.440 --> 32:04.967
Once I dramatically capture the werewolf,
slap him around a little bit...

32:05.120 --> 32:09.444
and heroically ride him into town,
open season will be closed again.

32:09.600 --> 32:12.729
And exactly how are you
gonna capture the werewolf?

32:12.880 --> 32:16.680
With a clever monster corralling
interpretive dance, of course. Duh.

32:16.840 --> 32:18.490
- Aye...
- Well...

32:18.640 --> 32:21.723
I'm not so sure about
Elliot's dancing abilities and I'm not...

32:21.880 --> 32:25.327
convinced there is a werewolf,
but I do know Shaw's guns are real.

32:25.480 --> 32:27.130
Elliot may be our only hope.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.045
If Elliot's our only hope, we're doomed!

32:30.200 --> 32:34.046
Hold up, everyone. It's true
that Shaw and his gun are on the loose.

32:34.200 --> 32:37.204
And until the werewolf is dealt with,
we're all at risk.

32:37.360 --> 32:40.125
But if Elliot says he can capture it,
I believe him.

32:40.280 --> 32:42.123
He's the best deer for the job.

32:42.280 --> 32:45.602
- Thanks for standing up for me.
- Friends don't abandon friends.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.728
What makes Elliot so qualified?

32:47.880 --> 32:53.523
Wah! I'm a master werewolf hunter-slash-
tracker-slash-expert-slash-whisperer.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.682
- That's three slashes.
- Aye.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.969
I'm coming with you. To make sure
you don't bust any more moves.

32:59.160 --> 33:03.722
Fine. The rest of you, stay alert.
If you see something, say something.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.045
Something.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.406
Where to first?

33:07.560 --> 33:12.646
In order to track the werewolf, we need to
start at the first place it appeared.

33:12.840 --> 33:15.411
Ooh, ooh! I know! At the RV!

33:15.560 --> 33:20.043
That's where Bob and or Bobbie
were eaten by the werewolf! Aw.

33:37.440 --> 33:40.842
Obviously none of you have ever been on
a Wailing Wampus Werewolf...

33:41.000 --> 33:44.800
investigation, so follow my lead.
Don't touch the evidence...

33:45.000 --> 33:48.607
don't contaminate the crime scene,
and do not, under any circumstances...

33:48.760 --> 33:51.081
pee on anything. Boog.

33:52.600 --> 33:56.002
- You're disgusting.
- Let's go!

33:56.240 --> 33:58.766
Elliot, what do we do
once we find the werewolf?

33:58.920 --> 34:00.809
Is there a special dance or something?

34:00.960 --> 34:04.965
We face the threat the same way
we face headlights: Head on.

34:05.600 --> 34:07.125
That is a terrible analogy.

34:07.280 --> 34:10.601
I have no idea what you just said,
Giselle, but touché.

34:17.320 --> 34:22.645
Movies! Two words! Um, ooh-ooh.
<i>Lethal</i> Weapon 2.

34:22.800 --> 34:26.690
The door is locked. Need Mr. Weenie
to go in through the doggy door.

34:26.840 --> 34:30.161
- I was way off.
- Oh. Why didn't you just say that?

34:34.000 --> 34:36.206
Welcome to the scene of the crime.

34:38.600 --> 34:43.128
Blasted fly zapper's on the fritz again.
You may enter.

34:43.280 --> 34:48.446
But I must warn you, what you are
about to see can't be unseen.

34:48.600 --> 34:53.891
It is a tableau of unfathomable depravity.
Come on in.

34:54.840 --> 34:58.925
The wiener dog is right. No offense,
Boog, but it might be grisly.

34:59.080 --> 35:01.003
- You're weird, Elliot.
- Weird like a fox.

35:01.200 --> 35:05.524
Aah! The horror!
The food bowl is empty.

35:09.120 --> 35:11.407
Actually, this is a nice crib.

35:12.600 --> 35:15.331
It's spotless. No signs of a struggle.

35:15.480 --> 35:19.724
Obviously the werewolf attacked Bobbie
and Bob, then cleaned the RV.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.723
He wants us to think he wasn't here.

35:21.880 --> 35:24.963
The Wailing Wampus Werewolf
is notoriously tidy.

35:27.240 --> 35:29.641
So you're saying the werewolf
cleaned the dishes?

35:31.040 --> 35:32.610
Classic werewolf move.

35:34.160 --> 35:36.811
I think this is equipment
for tracking a monster.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.530
Boog, you're new at this.

35:38.680 --> 35:42.207
What we could really use right now
is equipment to track the monster.

35:42.360 --> 35:43.646
You mean like this?

35:43.800 --> 35:47.202
Monster tracking equipment,
monster tracking equipment.

35:48.680 --> 35:53.322
Wow. The power of The See-cret.
Still not used to it.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.364
You know how any of this stuff works?

35:55.520 --> 36:00.845
I'll use my instincts. Part of being
an animal. We'll need this face helmet!

36:02.520 --> 36:05.126
- He's not gonna turn that thing on, is he?
- Probably.

36:10.000 --> 36:10.280
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:10.280 --> 36:11.850
We're not taking the face helmet.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:11.850 --> 36:16.560
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:16.560 --> 36:18.164
Well, that was a bust.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:18.164 --> 36:20.840
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:20.840 --> 36:22.000
Even though this werewolf is a neat freak,
he could have left a clue somewhere.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:22.000 --> 36:25.687
Even though this werewolf is a neat freak,
he could have left a clue somewhere.

36:26.800 --> 36:30.771
Like this one. Bone voyage.

36:30.920 --> 36:35.562
The werewolf has eaten poor Bobbie,
or maybe Bob. That's all that is left.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.403
I'm so sad. But so hungry.

36:41.560 --> 36:43.961
Oh, but so sad.

36:45.960 --> 36:48.281
Why does it smell like
11 herbs and spices?

36:48.440 --> 36:51.125
The smell of pure evil.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.322
No. It really smells more like
11 herbs and spices.

36:58.480 --> 37:02.087
I understand how you "laymen"
are having a hard time...

37:02.280 --> 37:04.601
- following my logic.
- Mm-hm.

37:04.800 --> 37:08.600
With this "monster tracking equipment,"
we'll be able...

37:08.760 --> 37:12.367
to cleverly track down the whereabouts
of our alleged perpetrator...

37:12.520 --> 37:14.807
i.e., for example, said werewolf.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.207
- Oh, goodie.
- Someone is coming.

37:17.360 --> 37:18.407
Quick, blend in.

37:21.560 --> 37:22.800
Moo.

37:24.880 --> 37:26.484
Moo. I'm a cow.

37:31.360 --> 37:34.682
Bobbie and or Bob, I shall avenge thee!

37:39.800 --> 37:43.930
Mr. Weenie, I brought you
some Weiner Chow.

37:44.080 --> 37:49.325
They're shaped like little wiener dogs.
Hm. Where could he be?

37:51.280 --> 37:55.683
Okay, Ed and Edna, let's put this thing
in cruise control...

37:55.840 --> 37:59.447
so we can go over my big plan
to track down this monster.

37:59.640 --> 38:01.847
- Big plan?
- Should we be taking notes?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.843
Just listen, dingdongs.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.927
Good old Sheriff Gordy has given us
carte blanch to blast away!

38:09.080 --> 38:11.048
Now, who's this here "Carte Blanch"?

38:11.200 --> 38:14.204
I think it's a kind of animal,
related to the penguin, eh.

38:14.360 --> 38:17.967
We get to shoot a real live werewolf!

38:19.880 --> 38:23.248
And by "werewolf," do you mean
one of them abominable snowmen?

38:23.440 --> 38:26.842
- No!
- Ooh, ooh! A chupacabra?

38:27.000 --> 38:28.411
“No! 'Vampire?

38:28.560 --> 38:30.801
A werewolf, you morons!

38:30.960 --> 38:36.569
A 10-foot tall, drooling, blasphemous
scourge that needs to be eradicated!

38:39.800 --> 38:42.087
Ugh. Traffic these days.

38:42.240 --> 38:46.404
Now, here's the fun part.
While we are hunting to extinction...

38:46.560 --> 38:49.564
this unholy denizen
from the very bowels of Hades...

38:49.760 --> 38:54.288
we can take out a certain bear and deer,
if you get my drift.

38:59.680 --> 39:04.971
My gut tells me that we'll find
our werewolf in Dead Bear Gulch.

39:05.120 --> 39:09.682
Oh. This is gonna be easy! The werewolf
is right there next to that.

39:09.840 --> 39:12.764
That's why I love you, Edna.
You're good at reading maps.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.361
Ugh. Imbeciles.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.245
- Ooh.
- Aah!

39:22.040 --> 39:26.568
There's certain werewolf behavior
that will clearly give away its location.

39:26.760 --> 39:29.411
Are you talking about where it eats,
where it sleeps?

39:29.560 --> 39:33.281
- Where it poos.
- What does poo have to do with this?

39:33.440 --> 39:35.283
It's our key to finding the werewolf.

39:35.440 --> 39:38.250
Its poo is like bread crumbs.
But way different.

39:38.400 --> 39:39.686
I'm not looking for poo.

39:39.840 --> 39:43.447
You don't have to.
I've got this trusty werewolf-poo finder.

39:43.600 --> 39:46.490
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
that isn't a werewolf poo-finder.

39:47.840 --> 39:48.887
You were saying?

39:51.440 --> 39:53.966
We've struck the mother lode.

39:55.880 --> 39:58.531
Isn't that kind of small
for werewolf poop?

39:58.680 --> 40:01.001
Werewolves are
notoriously small poopers.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.924
That reminds me of Bobbie.

40:03.080 --> 40:06.801
Who will save my precious doodoo
in a little plastic baggie now?

40:06.960 --> 40:08.883
- Don't look at me.
- You can learn a lot...

40:09.040 --> 40:11.884
about a monster from its poo.
It's the window to the soul.

40:12.040 --> 40:13.724
The eyes are the window to the soul.

40:13.880 --> 40:20.240
Not for a werewolf. It's poo.
It's always poo. We've got to analyze this.

40:22.200 --> 40:25.010
- He's touching it. Oh.
- Ugh. Ew.

40:25.280 --> 40:28.921
Elliot, what exactly
do you mean by "analyze"?

40:29.080 --> 40:32.129
It means
I must become one with the poo.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.050
This dropped fifty-seven... Wait.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.809
- Fifty-six minutes ago.
- He's good.

40:39.960 --> 40:43.851
That's strange. I hear the ocean.
Funny how that happens every time.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.963
How many times do you do this?

40:46.120 --> 40:48.361
Enough times to know
there's only one way left...

40:48.520 --> 40:51.285
to truly know
the werewolf's whereabouts.

40:52.280 --> 40:54.931
No. No, no, no!

40:55.080 --> 40:57.208
- What are you...? No! Ugh.
- Ooh!

40:58.280 --> 41:02.251
Mm-hm. He's heading north.
Seventh of eight kids.

41:02.400 --> 41:06.246
Left-handed, but bats righty.
Swimmer's build.

41:06.440 --> 41:12.891
Likes long walks in the moonlight.
I can taste it. And also... Pistachios?

41:13.040 --> 41:15.884
What in the bazookie are you doing?

41:16.040 --> 41:19.123
A field fecal study of
the Wailing Wampus Werewolf.

41:19.280 --> 41:22.682
That is mine. This is my spot.

41:22.840 --> 41:25.969
So that's not monster poo?
That's your poo?

41:26.120 --> 41:27.201
Aye!

41:27.360 --> 41:28.521
Just to be clear...

41:28.680 --> 41:32.162
you're saying the poo that's in
Elliot's mouth right now is your poo.

41:32.320 --> 41:35.563
I'd recognize
those pistachios anywhere.

41:39.320 --> 41:45.885
Code brown! Code brown! Friend's poo!
I just ate a friend's poo!

41:46.040 --> 41:50.125
We're not friends.
Friends don't eat friends' poo.

41:50.320 --> 41:56.362
Water, water, water! Need water now!

41:56.520 --> 41:57.885
The lake is right over there.

42:05.840 --> 42:09.367
Only a monster
would leave something like this behind.

42:09.520 --> 42:12.888
- The werewolf, eh?
<i>- I'll</i> check. Hmm.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.129
It's moving north.

42:17.280 --> 42:21.080
- Oh, yeah, you're good.
- We could use Jolene's help.

42:21.240 --> 42:24.961
I got her down by the lake.
Let's go pay her a visit.

42:25.760 --> 42:29.651
Don't leave now,
I was about to bring out dessert!

42:36.520 --> 42:42.163
Stop looking at my tushy.
Ugh. I can still taste the shame.

42:42.320 --> 42:47.201
♪ Elliot and Boog and Mr. Weenie
The bestest friends you ever seen-ie <i>H'</i>

42:47.360 --> 42:49.806
Not exactly a theme song moment,
Mr. Weenie.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.210
- Timber! Rookies.
- Ugh.

42:54.360 --> 42:56.044
Hey! What happened to him?

42:56.200 --> 42:59.283
- He accidentally ate McSquizzy's poo.
- Yeah, who hasn't?

42:59.440 --> 43:01.090
Despite this one minor setback...

43:01.240 --> 43:03.322
- I am not giving up.
- So let's recap.

43:03.480 --> 43:06.165
- You didn't find any clues at the RV.
- Check.

43:06.320 --> 43:08.209
McSquizzy's poo
didn't give us any clues.

43:08.360 --> 43:10.886
- Check.
- So we don't have any clues.

43:11.040 --> 43:13.850
Exactly! That's how I know
we're getting closer.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.001
I'm confused.

43:15.160 --> 43:18.687
The werewolf isn't leaving behind any
clues because he knows I'm onto him.

43:18.840 --> 43:21.002
He's clearly trying to outsmart me.

43:21.200 --> 43:24.090
- Hmm. Not that hard to do.
- Thank you, Giselle.

43:24.240 --> 43:26.447
Shaw!

43:27.600 --> 43:31.764
We won't hurt you, porcupine.
We just want to ask you a few questions.

43:31.960 --> 43:35.248
Oh, man. Shaw's never gonna stop
until he gets us all.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.562
We gotta find and capture
that werewolf fast...

43:37.760 --> 43:39.364
so they can call off
open season.

43:39.520 --> 43:42.444
We could find him if we could just
see the forest from above.

43:42.640 --> 43:45.166
If only we had a sea plane.

43:46.600 --> 43:50.730
I am mastering The See-cret.
All we need now is a pilot.

43:50.880 --> 43:52.644
Serge, can you fly?

43:52.800 --> 43:55.167
- But of course.
- Right this way, please.

43:58.080 --> 44:01.323
- Someone's jacking my plane!
- Who's Jack?

44:05.480 --> 44:07.881
Uhn. My seat belt won't go all the way.
Uhn.

44:08.080 --> 44:10.447
Elliot, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

44:10.600 --> 44:15.003
Yep, I can hotwire this thing. Now, do
I cut the blue wire or the red wire?

44:18.600 --> 44:21.171
- Yep. It's the red wire.
- Jolene!

44:21.960 --> 44:24.008
Whoa! They're coming!

44:24.160 --> 44:26.766
Uhn! Uhn! My horn's stuck!

44:29.160 --> 44:31.049
Lookie! A werewolf pilot!

44:33.200 --> 44:34.725
The werewolf? Duck!

44:38.600 --> 44:40.443
- Jolene.
- Jolene.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.602
Jolene!

44:45.320 --> 44:47.926
We did it! Ha-ha. Shaw!

44:48.120 --> 44:49.929
See you, wouldn't want to be you.

44:50.280 --> 44:52.851
Now, everyone keep your eyes peeled
for the werewolf.

44:53.040 --> 44:56.044
But don't literally peel them
because that would be gross.

44:57.440 --> 45:00.046
Oh, stewardess!
Would you mind asking the bunnies...

45:00.200 --> 45:03.443
not to recline so far back
into my personal space?

45:05.640 --> 45:08.849
- Nuts?
- Uh, got any wood?

45:11.520 --> 45:14.444
- Okay, Serge, take over.
- Take over?

45:14.600 --> 45:17.683
- Yeah. You said you could fly.
- My apologies.

45:17.840 --> 45:21.686
There has been a misunderstanding.
We can fly, just not a plane.

45:22.680 --> 45:25.763
Our pilots have left the plane.
This is bad, no?

45:25.920 --> 45:29.527
I just discovered a new fear. Heights!
Aah!

45:31.720 --> 45:32.881
Jolene!

45:34.800 --> 45:36.529
Are you afraid of plane crashes?

45:36.680 --> 45:38.523
I've always had a fear of plane crashes.

45:38.680 --> 45:41.684
But I thought being in one
was impossible since I'm a bear.

45:41.880 --> 45:44.565
Nothing is impossible
if you believe in yourself.

45:44.760 --> 45:49.163
Relax, everyone. Statistically,
flying is still the safest way to travel.

45:49.320 --> 45:50.401
If you got a pilot.

45:50.600 --> 45:53.604
It'll be fine. Quick question.
Is there a pilot on board?

45:53.760 --> 45:56.969
- Aah!
- Okay, is there a taxidermist on board?

46:02.640 --> 46:07.851
Oh, no! Since it appears this is the end,
I feel it's only right to confess.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.685
I'm not really German, I am Swiss!

46:10.840 --> 46:12.888
You're Swiss? Well, <i>hola!</i>

46:14.480 --> 46:16.960
Hey! We can use this
to float to the ground.

46:17.120 --> 46:18.360
Nice, Giselle.

46:20.120 --> 46:21.326
We're saved.

46:21.480 --> 46:22.561
Uh-oh.

46:28.120 --> 46:31.966
Do whatever you're supposed to do
in the event of an emergency landing.

46:32.120 --> 46:34.168
- Aah!
- Excellent.

46:34.320 --> 46:36.926
Maybe there's parachutes in the back.

46:39.240 --> 46:42.050
Boog, you're flying
by the seat of your pants!

46:47.280 --> 46:51.365
- You're a crack pilot! Hee-hee!
- Ls this what they call a bum steer?

47:01.560 --> 47:03.722
Boog, your butt saved ours!

47:08.200 --> 47:09.770
Hey, what'd I miss?

47:11.240 --> 47:13.208
Now it's personal.

47:13.360 --> 47:15.761
How did a werewolf
get a pilot's license?

47:15.920 --> 47:17.922
It's got the intelligence of a man.

47:18.080 --> 47:20.242
But you'd think
when it applied for a license...

47:20.440 --> 47:22.602
- somebody would have said something.
- Ooh!

47:22.760 --> 47:25.843
Maybe it dressed up like a man
when it went into the office.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.001
Shut your curd-holes!

47:27.160 --> 47:30.607
To catch the monster,
we've got to think like the monster.

47:30.760 --> 47:32.205
You mean think like a man?

47:32.360 --> 47:34.362
You said it's got
the intelligence of a man.

47:34.520 --> 47:36.887
Hm. What would a man do?

47:37.080 --> 47:39.242
Ugh. Morons.

47:41.600 --> 47:45.161
Come on, guys. We're not gonna
let a little thing like a "plane crash"...

47:45.320 --> 47:49.325
crush our spirits. We got us
a werewolf to catch. Who's with me?

47:50.160 --> 47:52.288
Crickets. Crickets. Crickets.

47:52.640 --> 47:55.962
Fine. But if you ask me, we got the
werewolf right where we want him.

47:56.840 --> 48:00.481
Elliot, maybe we ought to take a break
from all this werewolf stuff.

48:00.640 --> 48:03.610
- Re-strategize.
- Sorry, I don't parlez vous French.

48:03.760 --> 48:07.207
Look, we just survived a plane crash.
Maybe we should quit while...

48:07.400 --> 48:10.927
we're ahead and, I don't know,
build ourselves that panic room?

48:11.080 --> 48:13.526
There's plenty of wood.
We could build one ASAP.

48:13.680 --> 48:16.490
Could you build me a little tiny house
with my name on it...

48:16.640 --> 48:19.246
- that we could keep in the panic room?
- Sure thing.

48:19.400 --> 48:21.687
- I am in.
- Me too.

48:21.840 --> 48:25.208
You tried your best, Elliot,
but maybe you're in over your head.

48:25.360 --> 48:28.967
Guys, guys, guys,
and Giselle, and Ian...

48:29.120 --> 48:32.522
we're fighting for our forest!
Remember, if we don't get rid...

48:32.720 --> 48:37.009
of the werewolf, open season
stays open. And we're not quitters.

48:37.160 --> 48:40.209
Did the Romans quit when the Vikings
landed at Plymouth Rock?

48:40.360 --> 48:44.001
Did the mighty dodo bird
give up when it went extinct?

48:44.160 --> 48:47.562
Did the Titanic call it quits
when it hit the ice cream truck?

48:47.720 --> 48:49.529
Nope, nope, and nope.

48:50.160 --> 48:53.881
Sure, the werewolf has fangs,
Shaw has guns.

48:54.040 --> 48:59.331
But you know the one thing we've got
that nobody else has? Boog's butt!

48:59.480 --> 49:02.211
- Where are you going with this, Elliot?
- It's an amalgagee.

49:02.360 --> 49:03.646
- Analogy.
- That too.

49:03.800 --> 49:05.529
Point is,
when the chips were down...

49:05.680 --> 49:08.729
the odds were against us,
the pilots had left the building...

49:08.920 --> 49:11.207
We will never live this down.

49:11.360 --> 49:14.523
Boog's butt saved the day.
There's always gonna be something...

49:14.720 --> 49:17.644
that comes through for us,
because that's how we roll.

49:17.800 --> 49:20.121
Boog's <i>butt!</i> Boog's <i>butt!</i>

49:20.280 --> 49:22.248
Boog's <i>butt!</i> Boog's <i>butt!</i>

49:22.400 --> 49:24.482
I'm starting to feel
a little self-conscious.

49:26.080 --> 49:29.163
Great speech, but I vote
we build that panic room and hide.

49:29.360 --> 49:30.646
You can count us in.

49:30.800 --> 49:33.565
<i>Panic room, panic room, panic room!</i>

49:34.600 --> 49:38.571
All this talk about butts and panic rooms
is making me hungry again.

49:38.720 --> 49:40.245
I'm gonna search for some food.

49:41.600 --> 49:43.329
Okay, we got rid of our dead weight.

49:43.480 --> 49:46.484
Still with me, Boog? You know
I can't do this without my BFF.

49:46.640 --> 49:49.007
That's Bear Friend Forever, FYI.

49:49.160 --> 49:52.164
- For your information. LOL.
- Still with you.

49:52.320 --> 49:55.005
You know, maybe we've been
going about this the wrong way.

49:55.160 --> 49:58.130
- Maybe?
- Instead of going after the werewolf...

49:58.280 --> 50:01.045
maybe we should
lure the werewolf to us.

50:01.200 --> 50:02.361
What do you have in mind?

50:02.560 --> 50:06.963
Boog, you look like
a size 12... hundred. Petite.

50:07.120 --> 50:08.565
Why?

50:10.480 --> 50:11.891
Boog, we're waiting.

50:12.040 --> 50:14.042
I don't feel comfortable coming out.

50:14.240 --> 50:17.210
- I'm sure you look fine.
- Ugh.

50:28.920 --> 50:30.160
This is ridiculous.

50:30.320 --> 50:31.367
Ha-ha. Oh.

50:31.520 --> 50:34.410
- You're surprisingly cute.
- More importantly...

50:34.560 --> 50:38.690
you look exactly like a female Wailing
Wampus Werewolf. Give us a spin.

50:41.680 --> 50:43.728
I'm not sure I can pull this off.

50:43.880 --> 50:45.882
Let's rehearse. I'll pretend to be male.

50:46.200 --> 50:49.568
- Don't strain yourself.
- Boog, make me attracted to you.

50:49.720 --> 50:53.520
Uh, hi, I'm Boog...
I mean, Boogette.

50:53.680 --> 50:57.969
Cut! Ugh. That is not how you seduce
a Wailing Wampus Werewolf.

50:58.120 --> 51:01.522
Okay. Although, I'm pretty sure
there isn't a real werewolf...

51:01.680 --> 51:05.048
if you're gonna do this, let me help.
Now, Boog, play it cool.

51:05.200 --> 51:08.170
Make eye contact, but don't stare.

51:08.320 --> 51:14.089
Be mysterious, but not super scary.
And most importantly, smile.

51:14.480 --> 51:16.244
Heh, heh, heh. Ooh!

51:17.560 --> 51:19.244
Better. Much better.

51:19.400 --> 51:22.165
Giselle, obviously you know nothing
about being a woman.

51:22.320 --> 51:25.563
It's all about the body language.
You've gotta have the right walk...

51:25.720 --> 51:28.724
the right pose,
and the right eyelash flutter.

51:29.240 --> 51:34.041
This is dumb. It'll never work.
Walk. Pose.

51:34.200 --> 51:39.809
Well, hello there, miss.
Never seen you around these parts.

51:39.960 --> 51:44.204
You know, me and some friends
are building a romantic panic room...

51:44.360 --> 51:47.364
if you care to join me... I mean us.

51:47.520 --> 51:51.002
Ian, it's me, Boog. I'm not a lady.

51:51.160 --> 51:53.891
Oh, yeah. Call me.

51:55.480 --> 51:57.562
"It'll never work."

52:01.240 --> 52:04.642
I am so very hungry,
I could drink a horse.

52:06.720 --> 52:10.008
Mm! Food! At long last!

52:13.560 --> 52:16.166
I'm never gonna be
the girl you want me to be.

52:16.360 --> 52:18.203
Come on! We can make this work.

52:18.400 --> 52:20.607
Why can't you just accept me
for who I am?

52:20.760 --> 52:23.445
Uh, guys, this is getting
a little too intense.

52:23.600 --> 52:27.605
Instead of disguising me as bait,
why not use The See-cret?

52:27.760 --> 52:30.411
- Say it and you see it.
- I know!

52:30.560 --> 52:33.166
I'll use The See-cret. Genius!

52:33.560 --> 52:36.291
Wailing Wampus Werewolf,
Wailing Wampus Werewolf.

52:38.560 --> 52:42.884
Hey, guys! I have satisfied my hunger,
for now.

52:45.760 --> 52:50.288
Let's huddle. Oh, man.
Mr. Weenie's the werewolf.

52:50.440 --> 52:54.764
A wiener dog werewolf! Of course!
A textbook "wereweenie."

52:54.920 --> 52:58.766
Okay, break!
How could I have missed the signs?

52:58.920 --> 53:02.481
I'm sure there is a reasonable explanation
for what is on his face.

53:02.640 --> 53:05.530
Yes. And that explanation is, it's blood.

53:05.680 --> 53:07.648
Because Weenie
is a bloodthirsty werewolf.

53:10.240 --> 53:14.040
Think about it, Giselle. You never see
Mr. Weenie and the werewolf together.

53:14.200 --> 53:16.362
You never see the werewolf
and anyone together.

53:16.520 --> 53:18.921
In that case,
any one of us could be the werewolf.

53:19.080 --> 53:22.607
She's right.
Boog, are you the werewolf?

53:22.800 --> 53:24.609
- No.
- Giselle?

53:24.800 --> 53:26.962
- Yes, I am.
- I knew it!

53:27.120 --> 53:29.122
No, Elliot, I am not the werewolf.

53:29.280 --> 53:33.569
I knew that too. I was just testing you.
You passed. Barely.

53:33.720 --> 53:36.803
If we really want to make sure that
Mr. Weenie is the werewolf...

53:36.960 --> 53:39.327
we need to observe him
without him knowing.

53:39.480 --> 53:42.450
Like a stakeout. I love how I think.

53:42.600 --> 53:44.728
Tonight we complete our investigation.

53:44.880 --> 53:49.169
You boys have fun. I'm gonna find
a cool, dry place and call it a night.

53:52.200 --> 53:56.171
Hey, Mr. Weenie. We need you to,
uh, guard this log.

53:56.320 --> 53:59.051
Ooh. Mr. Weenie is on duty!

54:07.560 --> 54:11.724
The full moon is even fuller than
last night's full moon.

54:11.880 --> 54:15.566
If Mr. Weenie is gonna transform into
the werewolf, tonight's the night.

54:15.720 --> 54:18.929
We've got to stay awake.
No matter what.

54:19.080 --> 54:21.242
No problem. I can stay awake.

54:21.480 --> 54:23.050
- Mee-mee-mee.
- Elliot.

54:24.400 --> 54:29.281
Oh, Boog, I had the most wonderful
dream! Me and you were dolphins.

54:29.440 --> 54:32.842
I was a regular dolphin and you were
kind of a fat dolphin and we were...

54:33.040 --> 54:35.805
camping in the woods,
without a fear in the world.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.482
Although, we were getting dried out
with pine needles sticking to our fins.

54:39.640 --> 54:42.211
You were asleep two seconds
and you dreamed all that?

54:42.360 --> 54:46.604
Then this beautiful seahorse appeared
and we rode off into the sunset.

54:46.800 --> 54:48.211
What does that even mean?

54:48.360 --> 54:51.045
I think it means we're friends,
even if we're fish.

54:51.200 --> 54:52.531
Of course you're my friend.

54:53.160 --> 54:56.289
Okay, I know this is your first stakeout,
so don't hesitate...

54:56.480 --> 54:58.562
to ask me any questions.
For instance...

54:58.720 --> 55:03.647
this is a werewolf-transformation cam.
It will capture any transformation...

55:03.800 --> 55:06.326
the wiener dog makes.
But we must stay alert.

55:06.480 --> 55:08.403
- Got it.
- Be ready for anything.

55:08.560 --> 55:13.441
- I'm ready.
- Eyeballs must be open at all times.

55:17.600 --> 55:21.161
Hey, guys! Guys. Mr. Weenie is gone.

55:22.960 --> 55:24.644
Let's check the transformation cam!

55:31.120 --> 55:34.090
- He's sleeping.
- A clever werewolf ploy.

55:34.240 --> 55:36.288
Or he's a sleeping wiener dog.

55:38.880 --> 55:42.089
Aww. Obviously he's having a werewolf
dream of chasing...

55:42.240 --> 55:45.722
down and ripping apart
a helpless victim. Pretty standard stuff.

55:47.400 --> 55:49.641
- Another werewolf move?
- No.

55:49.800 --> 55:52.610
It's just a wiener dog
scratching his back. Come on. Ooh.

55:55.640 --> 55:58.291
That's the traditional
werewolf interpretive dance...

55:58.440 --> 56:01.444
done to summon other werewolves.
So graceful.

56:01.600 --> 56:05.127
It's settled then.
Mr. Weenie is the werewolf.

56:05.280 --> 56:09.888
So I am the werewolf? I'm always
the last to hear about these things.

56:10.320 --> 56:15.281
So that would mean I ate Bobbie!
And Bob. I must leave this place...

56:15.440 --> 56:19.490
before I eat my friends too.
I mean, think of all the calories!

56:20.600 --> 56:23.809
If he is the werewolf, why didn't he
attack you guys in your sleep?

56:23.960 --> 56:27.248
- Hmm. Good point.
- For once, Giselle, you're right.

56:27.440 --> 56:30.091
Mr. Weenie couldn't be the werewolf.
Well, no harm done.

56:33.400 --> 56:35.164
Shoot that ugly female werewolf!

56:35.320 --> 56:37.721
- What... Who's he calling ugly?
- Whoa!

56:37.960 --> 56:42.488
- It's in cahoots with the deer.
- What is this world coming to?

56:50.560 --> 56:53.803
Let's stop and talk this over,
you dirty rotten animals!

56:53.960 --> 56:55.962
We just want to be your friend!

56:57.840 --> 57:01.561
- What's these guys' deal, anyway?
- Yeah. What do they have against us?

57:06.560 --> 57:09.325
- Careful there, Shaw.
- We got a pot full of Poutine...

57:09.480 --> 57:11.050
- simmering in there.
- Aah!

57:14.440 --> 57:15.965
Whoa. Uh-oh.

57:16.160 --> 57:17.844
Aah! Huh?

57:19.880 --> 57:22.645
Well, we'll have to change
our commercial, Ed.

57:22.800 --> 57:25.041
Yeah. We're not by
the big tree no more.

57:25.200 --> 57:27.282
Come on, Canucks! Let's go!
Whoo-hoo!

57:30.280 --> 57:31.566
Aah!

57:37.800 --> 57:39.928
- The old lava mine?
- Who mines for lava?

57:41.840 --> 57:43.285
It's that or the hunters.

57:52.880 --> 57:54.370
How are we gonna get in?

57:54.520 --> 57:56.522
Guys, how about we use the door?

58:05.960 --> 58:07.530
- Aah!
- Whoa.

58:12.120 --> 58:13.770
Do you hear something? Aah!

58:16.080 --> 58:18.924
It was just a bunch of vampire bats
that feed off the blood...

58:19.080 --> 58:21.321
of living creatures. Everything's cool.

58:31.200 --> 58:34.488
- Let's hide in one of those!
- Uhn! I lost them.

58:34.640 --> 58:37.928
Are we sure jumping into
a rusty mining car on a rickety track...

58:38.080 --> 58:40.526
that leads who-knows-where
is the best idea?

58:40.720 --> 58:43.200
Come out, come out wherever you are.

58:43.360 --> 58:44.850
Sounds good to me.

58:47.120 --> 58:48.804
We're safe now.

58:49.000 --> 58:55.884
Ready or not, here we come!
Let's go mining for treasure.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.765
- Did we lose them?
- They're right on our tails!

59:02.920 --> 59:04.922
Ha-ha-ha!

59:09.000 --> 59:10.286
Whee!

59:16.520 --> 59:19.444
Whoa!

59:20.040 --> 59:24.284
I smell pumpkin pie. Uhn! It's me!

59:27.360 --> 59:28.691
Whoa!

59:28.880 --> 59:31.451
Who puts a loop-de-loop
in a lava mine?

59:32.040 --> 59:34.361
Whoa! Deer?

59:34.600 --> 59:37.365
- Whoa!
- Dinkelman!

59:37.560 --> 59:39.289
Whoa!

59:41.120 --> 59:44.283
Out of ammo.
Time to get touchy feely!

59:46.440 --> 59:50.889
Come here, werewolf!
I got her backpack! Reel me in!

59:51.520 --> 59:53.602
What does a werewolf
need a backpack for?

59:53.760 --> 59:56.969
- To keep his pilot license in.
- No!

59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.522
Hey! Let go of my
second-favorite bear!

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:07.564
Let go of my Dinkelman!

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:10.766
Dinkelman! No!

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.370
Dinkelman! SHAW: Dagnabbit!

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.729
Elliot, don't leave me!

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.247
Boog! I'll write you every single day!

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.565
Whoa!

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.246
Help!

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.726
Whee!

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:47.003
Whoa!

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.328
Werewolf, you've won this round.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.408
This ain't over.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:04.170
It figures. There's one cactus in all of
Timberline and I land right on it.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.651
Boog, I'm okay.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:10.647
We landed in this super-cushiony pile
of rose petals and clover!

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.926
Good thing we didn't land on old prickly.
Wasn't that crazy?

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.845
The dip where we went down
and our stomachs went up!

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.401
The lava singed my eyelashes!

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.643
Listen, Elliot, I've had enough!
This is too dangerous!

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:27.361
And now Dinkelman's gone.
You don't know what he meant to me.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:31.287
Yeah... But we're safe now.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.201
Safe? We've never been safe!
Crashing in airplanes...

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:39.160
getting shot at by hunters,
flying off the rails in a lava mine.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.961
We're so close to finding the werewolf.
We can't give up now.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.327
Now seems like the perfect time.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.009
Boog, I believe in you.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:52.131
When you want to be, you can be
a super brave bear. The superest.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.726
I've had enough! I'm done!

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:58.930
I'm building that panic room by myself
and hibernating forever.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.924
- Then after that, can we go camping?
- No, Elliot.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:08.968
Fine. I take it back. You're not super.
You're a pooper. I don't need you.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.925
Myself.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:16.648
Because myself never hurts my feelings
like certain heavy-set bears.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.885
- That doesn't even make sense.
- Words can hurt, you know, tubby?

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.690
Okay. Let's cool down for a second.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.810
I stood up for you because
I thought you were my best friend.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.689
- Maybe you're not.
- Huh?

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.970
You don't care about me. You only
care about your stupid camping trip.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:36.328
It's not stupid.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:40.127
Go find yourself a new best friend
who likes selfish deers.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.889
Well, you can forget about
that stupid camping trip!

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:50.408
I wouldn't go with you if you were
the last best friend on earth!

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.126
You hear that?
The werewolf is out there.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.362
He's hiding in Dead Bear Gulch.

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.367
I'm going after him. I'm not a selfish
deer. I'm gonna save everyone.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:11.047
Elliot, don't go. Shaw is gonna be
out there. It's too dangerous.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.089
Danger is my maiden name.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.844
Oh, no.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:22.250
I never should have trusted Elliot.
How could I have been so stupid?

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:24.647
- Boog, wait.
- I'm done with him.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.690
Elliot went about things the wrong way,
but he was genuinely...

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:30.080
trying to help you get over
your fear of the werewolf.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.170
Because all he cared about
was some dumb camping trip.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.368
He wanted to spend time
with his best friend.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.887
He tied pumpkins to my chest.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:42.005
I'll be the first to admit, Elliot is
a ding-a-ling. But he's our ding-a-ling.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:46.006
Can you give me a hand? I don't know
how you girls do this every day.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.846
Elliot can take care of himself.
That's what he's good at.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.002
Elliot is headed into Dead Bear Gulch.

01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:54.208
He's convinced the werewolf
will be hiding there tonight.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:57.728
Thanks for the tip.
Pine needle eyelashes.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:01.680
Unh. I'll be sure to stay far away
from Dead Bear Gulch.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.889
Boog, he cares about you.
And you care about him.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.611
The Boog I know
wouldn't abandon his friend.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:13.563
The Boog I know is gonna build
his panic room. See you, Giselle.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.570
So I am the werewolf. Go figure.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:25.090
In order to not viciously eviscerate
my beloved friends...

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:30.644
I am destined to wander aimlessly
these vast woods alone, forever!

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.087
But I am so hungry. Oh, shoot.
That must be the werewolf in me talking.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.723
Maybe if I don't look at the full moon,
I won't transform.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:47.807
But it's so beautiful.
Maybe one little peek.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:52.045
Oh, no! What have I done?

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.649

Hey, Booger. You hear that?
I called him "Booger."

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.326
What are you guys doing?

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.642
We took your advice
and built a panic room.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.968
Not bad. You got room for one more?

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.248
- Come on in.
- Take a load off.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.164
Just close the door behind you.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:27.482
So where's your best friend Idiot?
You notice how I called Elliot "Idiot"?

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.525
The great werewolf hunter
is in Dead Bear Gulch...

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.445
probably talking the ear off
of some poor werewolf.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.926
Shh.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:40.687
That's where it all began,
in Dead Bear Gulch.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.002
That's where we'll find our werewolf.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.202
But that gulch is haunted,
don't you know.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.010
Yeah. With evil spirits.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.845
Which is why the werewolf
will be hiding out there.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.929
We've got it on the run.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:55.448
It's gonna hunker down
in the one place it thinks we won't go.

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.410
- And where is that?
- Dead Bear Gulch!

01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.607
Oh, right.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:04.806
I got special camo for us in the truck.
We'll take him by surprise!

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.361
- Take who by surprise?
- The werewolf!

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.403
Ooh. I love surprises.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.729
Instead of Dead Bear Gulch,
they're gonna have to call it...

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.611
Dead Everything Gulch
by the time we're through.

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.410
We'll blast everything that moves.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.723
- You mean like us?
- How can we hunt if we can't move?

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:24.207
- Uhn. I won't blast you!
- But we'll be moving!

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:30.129
- Yeah! You said that...
- Forget what I said! Ugh. Canadians.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.604
- Elliot's in trouble!
- What are we gonna do, Boog?

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.841
Maybe we should go help him.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.609
Here monster, monster, monster.
Here monster, monster, monster.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:08.008
Elliot, please go. I'm a werewolf now.

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:12.000
I don't want to hurt you,
but I am not in control of my faculties.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.560
Sometimes I'm not in control of
my faculties either.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.165
I cover it up and walk away.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:21.121
Do your senses betray you?
Do you not see my vicious claws...

01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:26.161
my hideous fangs,
my irascible disposition?

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:32.042
I have become the werewolf!
And there are more of us behind you.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:33.966
I'm sorry, what?

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:39.841
My brothers.

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.408
Danger isn't my maiden name!
It's McGillicutty. I know, weird, right?

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:56.123
Oh, See-cret. I could sure
use your help right now.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.009
I need a hero to save me.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.288
Boog's butt? You're saving me?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.411
I'm a grizzly bear!
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:14.411 --> 01:10:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.725
Yes! Aah!

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.281
Ooh. Whoa.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:35.891
Aah!

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:40.570
Shaw? You mean there's no werewolf?

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:46.329
Well, if we can't bag a werewolf,
a deer and a bear will do just fine!

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.046
Come on, Canucks.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.843
The evil spirits! They're here!

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.610
Undead zombie ghost ducks
from hunting seasons past!

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:06.449
- What?
- I brought some friends.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.243
We should consider taking our talents
on the road, eh, Deni?

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:14.200
Where are you going?
I don't see any evil...

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.404
Wait for me!

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:20.291
Aye! Shake it, sister!

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.889
Fine. Abandon me. I got Lorraine.
She's all I need.

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.131
Face the wrath of a true werewolf!

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.443
- Oof!
- Ha-ha-ha!

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.006
Lorraine! Now, you've gone too far.

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.926
It's just you and me, bear.
Mano a bear-o.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:55.729
Your shoe's untied! Aah!
Come on, teddy bear! Free shot!

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:00.283
Too fast for you! Guess who?

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.646
- Ooh!
- Come on, scared-y bear!

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.045
Boo-boo-boop! Uhn! Ha-ha-ha.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.608
Ooh! Ha-ha-ha.

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.047
Ha-ha. Ooh.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.400
Crud.

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.045
That's gonna smart for a few days.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:33.767
- I'm allergic to hornets!
- Washcloth?

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:37.526
Aah! BUDDY: Buddy.

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.409
Why did you come back for me?

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:47.451
Because friends don't abandon friends.
You taught me that.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.883
Oh. My eyes are starting to pee.

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.129
Nice shooting, sheriff.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:14.522
Well, looks like we've found our werewolf.
Shaw, I should have known.

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:18.480
- I guess he's in deep doodoo.
- Ha-ha-ha. Sure is.

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:21.405
Selfie! And post.

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.963
- Bears...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:28.091
You'll have plenty to say
at your trial for posing as a monster...

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:33.201
and creating a general panic.
Open season is closed. Permanently.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.051
Take them away, boys.

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:44.731
Boog?

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.962
Thought I recognized your work.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.724
You know, you're always welcome
to come back home.

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.761
He's going back to live in town.

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:12.366
I understand. You are home.

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:18.327
Technically, I shouldn't be feeding
the wildlife, but I think...

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:22.451
we can make an exception.
Take care of yourself, Boog.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.481
Eeh!

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.210
Whoo-hoo!

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.522
I knew you wouldn't go back
to live in town.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.365
Of course not.
Who's gonna protect you, Elliot?

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.409
You can't go camping by yourself.

01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:40.448
I got something for you.
I was waiting to surprise you.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.841
Surprise! Happy Mother's Day!

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.363
Dinkelman!

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.362
Hey, how long you had him?

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.249
It's a See-cret.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:05.571
Hey, Boog. I can't believe it!
We're finally camping! Whoo-hoo!

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:09.930
I told you it'd be great. I got goosebumps
up and down my goose!

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:14.085
Exactly how is camping different
than what we normally do in the woods?

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.966
This is totally different!
It's just you and me and the stars...

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.442
above our horn and the dirt
beneath our fuzzy bottoms!

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.683
I thought you said there would be
zip lines and parasailing...

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:25.887
and boogie boarding.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.242
You haven't heard of
writer's embellishment?

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:31.006
- No.
- Me neither. I was hoping you knew.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:34.084
At least we're away from the riff raff.
See any riffs or raffs?

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.447
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Ian. Hey, Giselle.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:41.447
Hm. So hard to keep the riff raff out
these days. Boog! Staring contest! Go!

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:45.242
- What?
- Ah! Ooh. You're good.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:49.691
- Hey! Let's tell a scary story.
- Really?

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:54.448
I'll start. The Wailing Wampus Werewolf
was on the prowl.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:56.045
No one was safe.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:00.842
Ooh, scary. And the vicious werewolf
emerged from the dark...

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.688
through the misty mist, upon two friends
who were having a blast camping.

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.604
I think that's a great setup.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.685
- Ha-ha. Nice try, Ian.
- Aah!

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.844
Whoa. Props on the fake teeth.
Very convincing.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.650
Everything all right over there?

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.006
This is not Ian?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.765
Nice werewolf, good werewolf.

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:35.845
- Aah! I don't know what to do!
- Elliot! You know what to do.

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:40.883
Boog, you're right! I've been training
for this moment my entire life!

See? I told you.

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.406
The werewolf communicates
through interpretive dance.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:33.201
Yeah, interpretive dance and talking.
I can talk. Heh, heh, heh.

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:37.843
- I think he means us no harm.
- Whatever.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.561
We need to show him we don't either.
Everybody, dance now.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.171
Shake that tail feather!

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.210
- Bud... Bud...
- Ow!

01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:58.086
Busting a move.

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.169
Ooh. Impressive moves, Boog.

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.328
We should call you
Dances With Werewolves.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:10.284
Boog, I have something shocking
to tell you. I might not be the werewolf.

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:11.601
Got it, Mr. Weenie.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.324

And everybody lived happily ever after.

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:40.687
Except for Mr. Weenie,
who is now a drifter.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:49.970
Oh, Bobbie, or Bob.
How did it come to this?

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.650
Bobbie lives!

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:05.131
Surprise, Mr. Weenie!

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:13.446
I feel like it's been forever.
Did Gordy feed you? We asked him to.

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.927
That would have been nice to know.

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.321
We were at a See-cret convention...

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.650
you know, "Say it and see it." When
Bob says, "It's Mr. Weenie's birthday."

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.087
And I say "Gee, Bob,
do you ever quit talking?"

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:28.682
But then I say, "You're right."
So we gathered up all of your friends...

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.605
for a surprise birthday party.
Are you surprised?

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.925
- Not pleasantly.
- Mr. Weenie is excited to see us.

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:42.445
Are you excited to see him, Bob?
Oh, Bob is so excited, he's speechless.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:45.001
This is gonna be the best party.

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:55.046
So everybody did live happily ever after,
including Mr. Weenie. The end.

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.361
- Just one more time.
- No.
