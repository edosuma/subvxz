(male narrator)
Previously on
Children's Hospital..

00:05.106 --> 00:06.240
I just wish
we could hit rewind.

00:06.274 --> 00:09.177
- Life's not a VCR.
- I know.

00:09.210 --> 00:13.147
- Goodbye, Blake.
- Goodbye, Freckles.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.759
You're fired, 'cause I'd
rather be liked than right.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.761
You're not fired.
You're re-hired.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.330
Sweet.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.704
[Valarie thinking]
Babies.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.107
Somewhere under all
the masks we acquire

00:39.140 --> 00:41.275
we're just babies.

00:41.309 --> 00:46.214
Unwritten upon, innocently
pooping in public places.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.516
Where did you come
from, little one?

00:48.549 --> 00:51.352
Oh, what's this?

00:51.385 --> 00:55.723
"Please help me. My real parents
can't take care of me.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.759
"They can barely take
care of themselves.

00:58.792 --> 01:02.130
Please find me a home."

01:02.163 --> 01:04.532
I'll try, little one.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.733
I'll try.

01:08.669 --> 01:11.505
Then we grow up and change,
until we realize that

01:11.539 --> 01:14.342
people we thought we knew were
just more babies wearing masks.

01:14.375 --> 01:17.278
You can't judge a book by its
cover, unless, of course,

01:17.311 --> 01:19.713
it's a Mexican novella,
you know what you'll get.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.150
A peasant girl'll get raped
by a wealthy landowner.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.152
What are you gonna do?

01:24.185 --> 01:25.453
Whoa, Dr. Maestro!

01:25.486 --> 01:27.455
You know hospital
policy on sunglasses.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.822
Heart surgeons only.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.391
Take 'em off.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.866
Dr. Maestro,
what happened to you?

01:38.899 --> 01:43.171
It's nothing, Dori. I fell
down a flight of...fists.

01:43.204 --> 01:47.241
Listen, Owen, I had a...
friend who was always making

01:47.275 --> 01:48.842
excuses for her bruises.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.845
Turned out, it was her husband
who had been beating her.

01:51.879 --> 01:55.649
A "friend," huh, Dori? And what
happened to this "friend"?

01:55.683 --> 01:58.486
She got a job as a nurse
in a children's hospital

01:58.519 --> 02:02.156
and helped other people who were
suffering as she had suffered.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.858
Her nursing company moved her
to Santa Fe. We lost touch.

02:04.892 --> 02:08.729
She was kind of a bitch anyway,
so she probably deserved it.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.898
But the same exact
thing happened to me.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.901
The relocation,
not the beating thing.

02:13.934 --> 02:17.205
I got a 10-year-old with
severe knuckle trauma!

02:17.238 --> 02:20.641
Owen, meet me in Room 4, now!
Go, go, go!

02:20.674 --> 02:24.612
Sometimes we're all alone
in our pain, and sometimes

02:24.645 --> 02:27.581
we're just all alone and
there's nothing to..

02:27.615 --> 02:30.318
You can't think
of anything to..

02:30.351 --> 02:32.353
Talked about the
"book by its cover" thing

02:32.386 --> 02:37.258
the masks, the whole
peasant-girl dealie..

02:37.291 --> 02:39.760
Oh! There's something
happening in here.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.663
I'm honored, Senator, that
you would choose come to me.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.665
You seem to understand
the delicate nature

02:44.698 --> 02:46.834
of this request,
Dr. Spratt.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.537
The pro-life stance is essential
to my re-election bid.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.206
But my wife really
needs this abortion.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.642
I can't have a baby
right now, Doctor.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.944
My dancing career is
too important to me.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.779
I understand.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.282
And, Daniel, you're
okay with this?

03:01.315 --> 03:03.851
- I don't want to be aborted.
- You knock it off.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.987
Now, I do have to point out,
just medically speaking

03:07.020 --> 03:10.891
that your son is well beyond the
traditional age for an abortion.

03:10.924 --> 03:13.427
I'm a Christian, not interested
in your medical school

03:13.461 --> 03:17.598
scientific information proof,
left-wing voodoo mumbo-jumbo.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.833
My wife wants to be
a better jazz dancer

03:19.867 --> 03:21.869
and we need to get
rid of Daniel.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.505
- This is not brain surgery.
- But it is a surgery.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.474
Wow, heavy.

03:26.507 --> 03:29.843
Oh, here's something else I
can watch and comment on.

03:29.877 --> 03:33.281
Sometimes the worst in people
brings out the best in others.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.416
Hey. What is this?

03:35.449 --> 03:38.352
- Someone left an orphan here.
- Get rid of it.

03:38.386 --> 03:41.422
Speaking of masks,
Sy hasn't been himself lately.

03:41.455 --> 03:45.293
- Valerie, do you mind?
- Oh, you... You can see me.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.728
- Sy.
- Hmm?

03:47.761 --> 03:51.399
What has happened to you?
You used to be so kind.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.501
Yeah, but now I'm living
for myself now.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.902
Screw the others.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.538
Took me a long time to
get in that spotlight.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.640
Feel the light?
Huh, do you feel that?

03:59.673 --> 04:05.346
And now that I'm here...
I'm staying. Wah!

04:05.379 --> 04:07.581
I see what's happened,
and it's all my fault.

04:07.615 --> 04:10.851
I encouraged you to spread your
wings and then you went too far.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.387
It's as if I offered
you one drink

04:13.421 --> 04:16.890
and you've become
an alcoholic.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.793
Oh, my God.
I'm an alcoholic.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.795
That's what it is.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.664
- Eh, just..
- Help. Help.

04:23.697 --> 04:27.468
I'm a slave to the
demons of alcohol.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.837
I'll find a home
for you, wee one.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.374
Hold still, please.

04:33.407 --> 04:36.344
Owen, get over here.
Give me a hand, will you?

04:36.377 --> 04:38.646
Come on, he's gonna
lose this fist.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.814
'Come here. Restrain him''

04:40.848 --> 04:43.617
I'm sorry, Blake.
I can't do this.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.586
What the hell's
the matter with you?

04:47.020 --> 04:48.556
[breathing heavily]

04:50.691 --> 04:52.526
[thinking]
Hey, Owen.
You're not going anywhere.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.095
Hey, Owen. Hey, Owen.
You're not going anywhere.

04:55.128 --> 04:59.533
- Hey, Owen.
- Justin.

04:59.567 --> 05:02.970
- I'm just going to work.
- You're not going anywhere.

05:05.773 --> 05:10.378
I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.514
I'm a grown-up.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.985
I don't like children.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.987
[Valarie thinking]
Life is like chess.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.423
Sometimes, if you want
to shake up the board

05:22.456 --> 05:24.425
you've got to move
your pieces around.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.427
Blake to Lola 7.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.862
Lola, Blake here used to
perform a lot of abortions.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.998
Now you guys talk.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.434
Oh, is that true, Blake?
Were you an abortionist?

05:33.467 --> 05:34.968
- Oh, hells yeah.
- Why'd you stop?

05:35.002 --> 05:37.004
This is a very complicated
issue, you know.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.840
With a lot of different sides,
a lot of different viewpoints.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.842
Plus, it just
stopped being fun.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.713
I'm unsanitary.
I'm an alcoholic.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.581
I wish it were
a black-and-white issue.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.817
There are times when abortion
is a valid option

05:49.850 --> 05:53.086
like in cases of rape or incest
or if the mother's an a-hole.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.122
But other times,
it's such a gray area

05:55.155 --> 05:57.157
like when the baby
is sixteen years old.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.059
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

05:59.092 --> 06:02.062
At the end of the day,
it's a woman's right to choose

06:02.095 --> 06:04.632
and nothing trumps
my respect for women.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.900
You got to do what's
in your heart.

06:06.934 --> 06:10.037
- That's not my heart.
- I know.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.074
I just don't know
what to do.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.944
You got to go
with your gut.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.012
- That's not my gut.
- Oh, I know.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.748
I know that.

06:22.783 --> 06:26.454
If the senator wants an
abortion, then that's his choice

06:26.487 --> 06:28.489
and I should just
respect that.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.658
"Keep your laws off my body. "

06:30.691 --> 06:33.961
These pinkos say it always
at hospitals just like this.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.730
I say that abortion is
unacceptable in any case.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.599
Questions.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.634
'Senator, please. The question
was about your wife'

06:40.668 --> 06:42.069
'and her jazz-dance career.'

06:42.102 --> 06:43.704
Where was I?

06:43.737 --> 06:45.806
Oh, yeah, this whole thing.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.180
Gasoline!

06:53.213 --> 06:55.616
Is there something you
want to talk about, Owen?

06:55.649 --> 06:57.518
I'm okay.

06:57.551 --> 07:00.788
I once had a friend who needed
to get something off her chest

07:00.821 --> 07:03.223
really badly but couldn't,
so she turned to a friend

07:03.256 --> 07:05.225
who had had
a similar experience.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.996
That friend ended up helping
my friend get through it.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.999
- Was that friend you, Dori?
- Yes.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.668
- I was also the other friend.
- Wait, what?

07:14.702 --> 07:16.203
'Well, well, well''

07:16.236 --> 07:18.906
Dr. Maestro, finally ready
to help me with this kid?

07:18.939 --> 07:22.476
- Go for it.
- Ow!

07:22.510 --> 07:24.878
Blake, I have a
confession to make.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.114
I'm a battered doctor,
and every day before work

07:27.147 --> 07:28.849
this man beats me up.

07:28.882 --> 07:32.620
- He's a boy. He's 10.
- It seems that way.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.222
- It's that way. He's 10.
- You would think he's 10.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.124
- You'd know he's 10--
- Bet he's 11.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.859
What are we arguing about?

07:38.892 --> 07:40.561
Let's wake him to ask
if he has pubic hair.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.829
Let's never do that.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.631
- I bet he drives.
- Bet he doesn't.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.699
- He has a fulltime job.
- He goes to school full-time.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.868
- He's from the future.
- Why'd that explain anything?

07:47.901 --> 07:51.071
Looks like you two have
a lot to talk about.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.807
Like the fact that
he's only 10.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.943
No, he's not.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.545
(female announcer on intercom)
'Attention.'

07:57.578 --> 08:00.047
'Neurology rules,
oncology drools.'

08:00.080 --> 08:02.115
'Suck it, oncology.
Suck it.'

08:02.149 --> 08:04.852
This is quite a moral conundrum.

08:04.885 --> 08:08.522
Dr. Spratt. I'm calling it off.
We want to keep Daniel.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.558
- I don't understand.
- I'm gonna be a grandfather.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.225
Daniel is pregnant.

08:12.259 --> 08:16.229
Senator, that's impossible,
because Daniel is a..

08:16.263 --> 08:18.231
Boy, am I happy for you.

08:18.265 --> 08:21.201
My son is with child.
Come here.

08:21.234 --> 08:24.071
My son is with child.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.540
I fooled my parents into
thinking I'm pregnant.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.542
But what happens when
no baby arrives?

08:28.576 --> 08:30.811
They'll be sure
to abort me then.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.947
I think I might have a solution
that benefits everybody.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.948
Take this baby.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.919
Great.
Thanks.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.087
Okay.

08:46.259 --> 08:49.096
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.732
I beat you up all the time,
and it's super-embarrassing

08:51.765 --> 08:53.901
- because I'm only 10.
- Why do it?

08:53.934 --> 08:56.970
I've a dark, but socially
relevant situation at home.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.806
It doesn't justify my
aggressions towards you

08:58.839 --> 09:00.641
but nevertheless,
it's my source of rage.

09:00.674 --> 09:04.244
My dad used to smack me on
the head with a sledgehammer.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.747
You mean a sledgehammer,
just like this one?

09:06.780 --> 09:08.215
No way.

09:08.248 --> 09:11.051
I carry it with me everywhere
I go to remind me

09:11.084 --> 09:14.688
of the terrible and humiliating
things my father did to me.

09:16.724 --> 09:19.292
You see, we're not so
different after all.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.261
- Yeah.
- Ow!

09:25.032 --> 09:28.335
Babies. That's all we are.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.771
You know I can't
hear you, right?

09:30.804 --> 09:32.773
Books without covers..

09:32.806 --> 09:35.909
Dead air.
That's all I'm getting.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.278
Long pause, while
you're staring at me.

09:38.311 --> 09:41.081
Stories without endings..

09:41.114 --> 09:43.150
Still doing it?
Yeah.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.152
Well, I guess
that's her thing.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.621
Tales filled with tragedy..

09:47.655 --> 09:50.691
I'm gonna drink myself to death
right here in this hotel room

09:50.724 --> 09:53.727
at this second,
right now, watch.

09:53.761 --> 09:56.997
Oh, my God, I don't know how
people can drink this stuff.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.767
Tales filled with beauty..

09:59.800 --> 10:01.735
You did it.
Oh, it's a boy.

10:04.972 --> 10:08.842
Fairy tales filled with whimsy
and childlike wonder.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.844
And that's the end.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.846
Or maybe it's the beginning.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.848
What the hell happened here?

10:14.882 --> 10:16.984
A sledgehammer.

10:17.017 --> 10:20.253
Or maybe it's a little bit of
both, a beginning and an end.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.689
A begending.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.657
So, the begend.

10:26.326 --> 10:29.262
[theme music]

10:42.342 --> 10:46.680
(female announcer)
'Attention. I'm on a seafood
diet. I only eat seafood.'

10:48.415 --> 10:49.416
Ahh!
