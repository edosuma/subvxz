How about this kind?

01:00:37.375 --> 01:00:38.583

01:00:42.292 --> 01:00:43.667
Um...

01:00:43.833 --> 01:00:44.917
are you all right?

01:00:45.042 --> 01:00:46.625
Ken?

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:48.208
Mm-mm-mm.
No, no, no, um.

01:00:48.375 --> 01:00:50.625
I'm so sorry.
I'm fine.

01:00:51.875 --> 01:00:54.292
No, you're...
you're definitely not.

01:00:56.042 --> 01:00:56.833
What's wrong?

01:00:58.208 --> 01:00:59.833
Ken, what's up?

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:00.958
[sighs]

01:01:01.042 --> 01:01:02.500
Come on.

01:01:02.625 --> 01:01:05.167
[♪]

01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:11.292
Something happened to me.

01:01:14.542 --> 01:01:16.292
This guy...

01:01:16.375 --> 01:01:17.458
[inhales shakily]

01:01:17.583 --> 01:01:19.292
[sighs]

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:21.750
[quietly] ...he kind of like
forced himself on me.

01:01:22.708 --> 01:01:24.667
What? When?

01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:27.333
The night we were
supposed to go get dinner.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:28.417
That's why I didn't show up.

01:01:28.542 --> 01:01:29.667
Who did it?

01:01:29.792 --> 01:01:30.875
I'm not gonna tell you
who it was.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.417
It really doesn't even matter.

01:01:32.542 --> 01:01:33.375
No, of course it does matter!
What do you mean, it--?

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.417
Ben, stop. Stop!

01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:37.167
Okay, but if you tell me
who it is,

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:38.833
my peoples are lawyers.

01:01:38.958 --> 01:01:40.667
-We could fix this like this.
-No!

01:01:40.792 --> 01:01:42.875
I've been thinking
about all of this.

01:01:43.958 --> 01:01:46.083
It's his word
against my word.

01:01:46.208 --> 01:01:47.542
There's no evidence.

01:01:47.667 --> 01:01:50.417
I didn't do a rape kit.

01:01:50.542 --> 01:01:51.958
It...

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.458
the fact
that we're even thinking

01:01:53.542 --> 01:01:54.750
about all of this
going public,

01:01:54.875 --> 01:01:56.500
I can't do that right now.

01:01:56.625 --> 01:01:58.292
I understand...

01:01:58.375 --> 01:02:00.125
I understand.

01:02:00.208 --> 01:02:03.542
Look, I'm... I'm really sorry
this happened to you.

01:02:11.667 --> 01:02:13.875

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.083
[chuckles]
Thank you.

01:02:15.208 --> 01:02:16.458
[quietly] Wow.

01:02:16.583 --> 01:02:19.875
What do you think
about showing them

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.833
at the Spring Showcase?

01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:23.458
That would be amazing.

01:02:23.542 --> 01:02:24.750
Then it's done.

01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:26.958
Now, have you given
any more thought to Maddox?

01:02:28.208 --> 01:02:31.083
Didn't I miss the deadline
for transfers?

01:02:31.208 --> 01:02:33.333
If you can get your application
in by the end of February,

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:34.333
you'll still be considered.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.625
That's in two weeks.

01:02:35.708 --> 01:02:37.125
Can you swing it?

01:02:38.542 --> 01:02:40.375
You really think
I got a shot?

01:02:40.542 --> 01:02:42.042
I really do.

01:02:43.708 --> 01:02:45.667
Okay.

01:02:53.542 --> 01:02:55.458
we finally could get Kendra
out of the house, girl.

01:02:55.542 --> 01:02:57.000
Yeah.

01:02:57.125 --> 01:02:58.958
[Ben] Hey, you want a drink?

[♪]

01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:13.667
That's just soda.

01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:15.000
Just soda,
nothing else.

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:16.333
Aw, thanks.

01:03:16.458 --> 01:03:17.458
You want to dance?

01:03:17.542 --> 01:03:18.542
Huh?

01:03:18.667 --> 01:03:19.667
Dance! Like...

-Some air.

Ken. Ken?
Are you all right?

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:49.542
[tearfully] No.

01:03:49.708 --> 01:03:50.792
He's here.

Talk to me.

What's up, Benjamin?

01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:07.417
I know what you did.

01:04:08.833 --> 01:04:10.375
-What are you talking about?
-Admit it.

01:04:10.542 --> 01:04:12.042
Ben, come on.
Take me home.

01:04:12.167 --> 01:04:13.875
Yeah, Ben.

One second.

I'm so sorry.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.333
No. No, no, no, no.

01:04:40.458 --> 01:04:42.333
It's not your fault.

01:04:42.417 --> 01:04:44.167
You were just trying
to protect me.

01:04:44.292 --> 01:04:44.958
[tersely] Enough.

01:04:45.083 --> 01:04:47.167
Benjamin.
We're leaving.

Are you okay to get home?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.542
-Yeah.
-Are you sure?

What were you thinking,
Benjamin?

Risking everything
for some girl?

01:05:06.708 --> 01:05:07.833
It wasn't Kendra's fault.

01:05:07.958 --> 01:05:09.125
Do you know

01:05:09.208 --> 01:05:10.333
how embarrassing this is
for your father and I?

01:05:10.417 --> 01:05:11.542
You don't even know
the full story!

He's unconscious, Ben!

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:13.833
He deserved it!

01:05:13.958 --> 01:05:15.000
You don't mean that.

01:05:15.167 --> 01:05:17.083
No, I do,
and don't tell me what I mean.

[sternly]
Watch your tone.

This girl has been
a terrible influence on you.

You're not yourself lately.

[blurting]
How could you possibly know?

01:05:26.875 --> 01:05:28.333
How could you know who I am?

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:30.375
You have never asked me
a single question

01:05:31.583 --> 01:05:32.958
or-or what I want,

01:05:33.042 --> 01:05:34.042
or what I'm interested in.

01:05:35.333 --> 01:05:37.208
You know? Like, do you know
how awful it feels

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:39.042
for your parents to have
zero curiosity about you?

01:05:39.958 --> 01:05:41.208
I'm not you!

01:05:41.375 --> 01:05:43.583
And yeah,
I may not know who I am

or what I want to be yet,

01:05:44.875 --> 01:05:47.750
but Kendra's the first person
in my life

01:05:47.875 --> 01:05:49.333
who's ever thought to ask.

have put you in--

is the suspension for?

Until the case is closed.

01:06:33.542 --> 01:06:34.375
What? There's a case?

01:06:34.542 --> 01:06:37.000
Reg's parents
decided to press charges.

01:06:38.583 --> 01:06:40.000
Hey, it's not your fault.

01:06:40.125 --> 01:06:42.292
Yeah, but it is.
Your mom is right.

What are you talking about?

01:07:22.583 --> 01:07:24.833
Your parents are
pressing charges against Ben.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.958
I didn't want to.
It's my mom.

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:29.000
I told her not to,
but she wouldn't listen.

01:07:29.125 --> 01:07:31.500
Well, you'll just have
to make her listen then,

01:07:31.667 --> 01:07:32.542
huh, Reg?

01:07:34.875 --> 01:07:36.833
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.625
My mom's pissed I'm in here.

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:41.000
So, she's not gonna back down,
but I'll try.

01:07:41.125 --> 01:07:43.250
Trying isn't good enough, Reg.

01:07:43.375 --> 01:07:45.458
I need you to tell her
it was your fault,

01:07:45.583 --> 01:07:48.083
and that she can't
press charges.

01:07:49.542 --> 01:07:51.125
All right, this is how
this is gonna work.

You either guarantee me

01:07:53.042 --> 01:07:55.167
those charges
are gonna be dropped,

01:07:55.292 --> 01:07:57.500

you raped me.

it was my fault.

01:09:28.958 --> 01:09:30.333
Hmm. Mm.

01:09:30.458 --> 01:09:31.583
Kendra?

01:09:31.708 --> 01:09:33.167
What'd you do?

01:09:33.333 --> 01:09:35.667
I just paid Reg a little visit
at the hospital.

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:36.750
You what?

01:09:36.875 --> 01:09:38.583
Yeah, I told him
if he didn't drop his charges,

01:09:38.708 --> 01:09:39.500
I was gonna press my own.

01:09:39.667 --> 01:09:42.417
Look, I know you want
to protect me,

01:09:42.542 --> 01:09:45.542
but I want
to protect you, too, so...

01:09:45.708 --> 01:09:47.208
just let me.

01:09:48.583 --> 01:09:49.875
Okay.

01:09:59.208 --> 01:10:01.167

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.875

01:10:08.042 --> 01:10:09.042
Hey.

01:10:09.208 --> 01:10:11.417
Are you--
are you all right?

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:14.000
Oh.

01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:15.708
Wait.

01:10:18.083 --> 01:10:20.708
I'm sorry
I've been so awful to you.

01:10:23.708 --> 01:10:25.583
[sighing]

01:10:32.792 --> 01:10:34.708
What's... What's going on?

01:10:42.083 --> 01:10:43.917
I'm pregnant.

01:10:47.542 --> 01:10:49.458
Um...

01:10:50.583 --> 01:10:52.250
...what did the father say?

01:10:52.375 --> 01:10:54.333
It doesn't matter.
I'm keeping the baby.

01:10:54.458 --> 01:10:56.792
Have you told him yet?

01:11:02.083 --> 01:11:03.583
Who's the father, Connie?

01:11:04.875 --> 01:11:06.833
Ben.

01:11:06.958 --> 01:11:08.375
Ben is.

[indistinct exchange]

01:11:22.292 --> 01:11:23.333
'Cause you don't even know
what you're doing.

01:11:23.417 --> 01:11:24.583
We'll just put you
down for that.

01:11:24.708 --> 01:11:25.917
You're not getting the--
You know what this is?

01:11:27.708 --> 01:11:28.375
Okay.

01:11:28.542 --> 01:11:29.958
-What's up?
-"What's up?"

01:11:30.042 --> 01:11:31.625
"What's up?"
Really?

01:11:31.708 --> 01:11:32.792
Can you stop?

01:11:32.875 --> 01:11:34.708
No, shut-- No.
You go talk to her about it.

01:11:34.833 --> 01:11:35.917
Not me.

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:36.875
Kendra, can you wait up?

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.458
Ken!

01:11:48.583 --> 01:11:49.500
Ooh.

01:11:50.958 --> 01:11:52.667
Ben was looking for you again.

01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:54.375
I'm not ready
to talk to him.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:55.292
Still? Girl, come on.

01:11:55.375 --> 01:11:56.833
It's been--

01:11:56.958 --> 01:11:58.958
You do you.

01:12:08.292 --> 01:12:09.208
Oh, my god.
It's here.

01:12:09.375 --> 01:12:10.417
What is?

01:12:11.292 --> 01:12:12.500
Oh, my gosh!

01:12:27.708 --> 01:12:28.833
-I got in!
-[shrieking]

01:12:36.875 --> 01:12:39.792
Kendra Evans is a first-year
photography student

01:12:39.875 --> 01:12:42.833
and we're excited to have her
be part of the show tonight.

01:12:44.292 --> 01:12:45.625
Hey, how are you?

01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:47.167
I can't believe you guys came!

01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:49.000
I'm so proud of you.

01:12:51.208 --> 01:12:52.333
Um...

01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:56.458
Congrats, Ken.

01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:59.042
Thanks.

01:12:59.167 --> 01:13:01.167
Can we go
somewhere private?

01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:03.042
I don't think
this is a good time.

01:13:03.208 --> 01:13:05.167
Please, Kendra?

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.625
You've been
avoiding me all week.

01:13:11.042 --> 01:13:12.000
[quietly] I'm gonna step out.

01:13:26.792 --> 01:13:29.375
Uh, so, my-- my parents want me
to marry Connie.

01:13:29.542 --> 01:13:31.708
I swear,
I didn't know, Ken.

01:13:31.833 --> 01:13:34.167
It must've happened
while we were on a break.

01:13:34.333 --> 01:13:35.333
My parents are livid,

01:13:35.417 --> 01:13:36.750
and they're saying
if I don't...

01:13:38.292 --> 01:13:40.125
...they'll cut me off
of everything--

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.292
tuition, childcare.

01:13:42.375 --> 01:13:43.458
That's tough.

01:13:43.542 --> 01:13:45.000
[scoffs, hurt]

01:13:45.125 --> 01:13:46.625
That's all you have to say?

01:13:46.708 --> 01:13:48.250
What do you want me
to say, Ben?

01:13:48.375 --> 01:13:49.875
I don't know.
I don't know.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.375
I've seen Sunny grow up
without a father.

01:13:52.542 --> 01:13:54.458
Marrying her makes sense.

01:13:54.542 --> 01:13:56.458
It's the responsible thing
to do.

01:13:56.542 --> 01:13:58.458
I can't marry her.

01:13:58.542 --> 01:14:00.917
I love you, Kendra, and...

01:14:02.625 --> 01:14:04.333
Look, I'm so sorry
that this is happening.

01:14:04.417 --> 01:14:06.583
Ben, this is not
just "happening."

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.417
These are choices
that you made.

01:14:08.542 --> 01:14:09.458
But you broke--

01:14:09.542 --> 01:14:12.333
you broke up with me!

01:14:12.458 --> 01:14:14.667
Are you seriously sitting here,
blaming me,

01:14:14.792 --> 01:14:16.958
for you impregnating
another woman?

01:14:17.083 --> 01:14:18.875
No. No. No, no.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:19.833
That's not what I meant.

01:14:19.958 --> 01:14:21.167
Look, I'm an idiot.

01:14:21.292 --> 01:14:22.417
Okay? I'm an idiot.

01:14:22.542 --> 01:14:24.417
I've always known
it was you.

01:14:24.542 --> 01:14:26.333
I've always wanted you
and I'm just...

01:14:26.417 --> 01:14:29.333
pissed at myself

01:14:29.417 --> 01:14:31.333
that I allowed myself
to be distracted

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:33.542
by someone
who was clearly not it.

01:14:36.708 --> 01:14:38.417
I just want to do
the right thing.

01:14:38.542 --> 01:14:39.708
I know.

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:42.583
I know you do.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.208
Look, um...

01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:48.958
I'm gonna be there
for my kid.

01:14:53.042 --> 01:14:54.875
That's good.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.333
But I also want to keep
being there for you, too.

01:14:58.417 --> 01:15:00.667
I want to--
I want to be with you, Kendra.

01:15:00.792 --> 01:15:02.250
Me too.

01:15:02.375 --> 01:15:04.958
Yeah?

01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:09.125
I feel like I can do anything
with you by my side.

01:15:14.375 --> 01:15:16.875
I applied to Maddox...

01:15:18.333 --> 01:15:19.458
...and I got in.

01:15:20.708 --> 01:15:21.875
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:15:22.042 --> 01:15:23.125
What? W...

01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:24.542
What?

01:15:24.667 --> 01:15:28.708
Professor Lovett,
she encouraged me to transfer.

01:15:28.875 --> 01:15:31.000
Yeah, but why didn't you
tell me you was applying?

01:15:31.125 --> 01:15:33.000
I-I didn't even think
I was gonna get in.

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:34.458
So, what? Are you gonna do it?
Are you transferring?

01:15:34.583 --> 01:15:36.500
I don't know!

01:15:36.625 --> 01:15:39.250
It's the best program
in the country,

01:15:39.375 --> 01:15:43.500
and with everything
that happened with, you know...

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.833
...it would be a relief
not to have to be

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:49.500
at the scene of the crime
for another three years.

01:15:49.583 --> 01:15:50.917
So, you're just running away?

01:15:51.042 --> 01:15:54.042
I'm not running away!
I'm running towards something.

01:15:54.167 --> 01:15:55.917
[sadly] Right.

01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:00.167
I should get back.

01:16:03.042 --> 01:16:05.167
So, are we over?

01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:07.333
[sighs]

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:09.958
I don't know.

01:16:10.042 --> 01:16:12.292
[♪]

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:21.833
So, what are you gonna do?

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.292
I don't know.

01:16:24.375 --> 01:16:26.250
I've just been doubting

01:16:26.375 --> 01:16:28.500
everything he ever said
about us.

01:16:28.625 --> 01:16:29.833
I mean, I was already
on the fence

01:16:29.917 --> 01:16:32.625
about transferring, but...

01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:35.000
I mean,
if he could just throw away

01:16:35.167 --> 01:16:36.083
everything we have and...

01:16:36.208 --> 01:16:37.667
I hear you, Ken.

01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:39.958
And not to make excuses
for him--

01:16:40.042 --> 01:16:40.625
you're right.

01:16:40.708 --> 01:16:41.958
But you know,

01:16:42.083 --> 01:16:44.208
I didn't plan on
getting pregnant as a teenager.

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:47.500
I was a kid who thought,
"What could possibly go wrong?"

01:16:47.583 --> 01:16:49.333
I'm sure Ben meant
what he said.

01:16:49.417 --> 01:16:51.583
Life just happens sometimes.

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:55.083
What would you do
if you were me?

01:16:55.208 --> 01:16:56.542
[playfully] Wow!

01:16:56.667 --> 01:16:58.500
Are you asking me for advice?

01:16:58.583 --> 01:17:00.958
No, for real.

01:17:02.708 --> 01:17:05.083
I would choose myself.

01:17:06.333 --> 01:17:09.500
You're the most amazing person
I know, Kendra,

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:10.458
and I know
what you have with Ben

01:17:10.542 --> 01:17:11.500
-...is--
-Special.

01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:12.958
Yes, special,

01:17:13.083 --> 01:17:15.958
but you've always chosen
the path of most resistance

01:17:16.042 --> 01:17:17.333
your entire life.

01:17:17.417 --> 01:17:19.458
If transferring feels good...

01:17:19.542 --> 01:17:20.708
do that.

01:17:22.625 --> 01:17:24.750
Choose your art.
Choose yourself.

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:28.250
Don't clip your wings, Kendra.

01:17:29.417 --> 01:17:30.375
Use them.

01:17:31.708 --> 01:17:34.000
[♪♪]

01:17:49.458 --> 01:17:50.875
Hey...

01:17:51.042 --> 01:17:52.750
Hey.

01:17:55.583 --> 01:17:57.750
Yeah.

01:18:03.625 --> 01:18:05.625
[exhaling]

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:12.083
So, I've decided
that I'm not marrying her...

01:18:12.208 --> 01:18:15.292
and I don't care
if my parents cut me off.

01:18:15.375 --> 01:18:17.167
I'm gonna figure it out.

01:18:18.458 --> 01:18:19.875
I'm proud of you.

01:18:21.667 --> 01:18:23.417
Thanks.

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:26.708
I'm proud of you, too,

01:18:26.875 --> 01:18:29.500
and I-I know I should have
said that way sooner.

01:18:29.583 --> 01:18:31.667
Mm.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.750
So, when do
you leave for Chicago?

01:18:35.875 --> 01:18:37.917
Uh, Professor Lovett
got me a summer job

01:18:38.042 --> 01:18:39.333
working at a gallery out there,

01:18:39.458 --> 01:18:41.542
so I'll spend a week at home,

01:18:41.708 --> 01:18:43.917
and then I'm heading out.

01:18:45.375 --> 01:18:47.125
Wow, that's...

01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:48.333
[deep breath]

01:18:48.458 --> 01:18:49.500
...that's--
that's really soon.

01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:51.792
Yeah.

01:18:55.125 --> 01:18:58.208
Look, we could...
we can make this work.

01:18:59.417 --> 01:19:01.792
The baby is not due
for another few months.

01:19:01.875 --> 01:19:03.500
I could come out there
and visit?

01:19:03.667 --> 01:19:05.125
How?

01:19:05.250 --> 01:19:06.917
You'll be broke.

01:19:08.458 --> 01:19:09.917
Your baby needs you.

01:19:10.042 --> 01:19:11.125
Yeah.

01:19:16.833 --> 01:19:18.958
You're my best friend.

01:19:20.292 --> 01:19:22.000
You know that, right?

01:19:23.625 --> 01:19:26.500
You're mine, too...

01:19:26.583 --> 01:19:28.500
but don't tell Terry that.

01:19:28.667 --> 01:19:30.708
[chuckling]

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:41.750
If you knew...

01:19:42.875 --> 01:19:45.417
...what you know now...

01:19:47.958 --> 01:19:50.000
...would you do it
all over again?

01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:57.000
Hmm.

01:19:58.833 --> 01:20:01.708
Honestly?

01:20:01.875 --> 01:20:03.250
I don't know.

01:20:06.708 --> 01:20:08.292
It really hurts.

01:20:11.708 --> 01:20:13.583
[sighing] I know.

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:15.167
I'm so sorry.

01:20:21.208 --> 01:20:23.000
You know...

01:20:25.625 --> 01:20:29.667
