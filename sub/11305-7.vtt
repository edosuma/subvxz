00:01.126 --> 00:03.038
<i>Previously on Wynonna Earp...</i>

00:03.212 --> 00:05.493
Why do revenants always have
to be such a frigging hassle?

00:05.631 --> 00:06.963
He attacked my home, Dolls.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.652
A souvenir photo
with my father's body.

00:08.717 --> 00:10.333
This is what Bobo's
been digging up

00:10.511 --> 00:11.922
half of Purgatory for.

00:12.095 --> 00:14.633
Oh, my God,
it's a real dead guy.

00:14.806 --> 00:16.091
I know what you really are.

00:16.265 --> 00:17.632
- Competition.
- The enemy.

00:17.809 --> 00:20.176
Nobody goes out there
unless they really have to.

00:20.354 --> 00:23.392
Who is this person nobody
goes to see unless they have to?

00:23.565 --> 00:25.602
The Blacksmith.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.642
She's coming for me.
I need to find some salt.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.185
Who's coming? Am I in danger?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.025
Of course you are.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.084
Witch.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.584
Well, shit.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.924
John, John, John...

00:56.932 --> 00:59.970
didn't I blow you up
with a motorbike?

01:00.143 --> 01:01.725
Yeah, well, it didn't take.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.636
This one will.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.980
Oh, you like
to make an entrance.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.644
Hey, Doc...

01:12.864 --> 01:15.322
you want to tell me
why you're living in the woods,

01:15.492 --> 01:18.405
screaming in your sleep
and being ambushed by revenants?

01:18.579 --> 01:20.161
I had him
right where I wanted him.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.947
On top of you?

01:27.004 --> 01:29.212
If you are done your business,

01:29.381 --> 01:31.418
I wouldn't mind getting
some shut-eye, so...

01:31.592 --> 01:34.585
Not done yet. I'm here on recon.

01:34.761 --> 01:38.345
Johnny-Come-Twicely was a bonus.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.267
Last of the Seven is too blurry
for me to make out,

01:43.437 --> 01:45.269
but you knew Auggie so...

01:50.068 --> 01:52.435
Wynonna, you wanna know why
I nearly got my throat slit?

01:52.613 --> 01:55.856
Because I've been
helping the heir.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.319
You.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.154
And I'm doing it for nothing.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.248
That's funny. I thought
you were doing it for me.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.662
I have my own devils to trap.

02:02.831 --> 02:06.074
So unless we are gonna make this
a more equal partnership,

02:06.251 --> 02:08.834
I must politely say go to hell.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.844
Oh, wake up.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.512
I know you're here.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.180
I can smell you.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.520
Sure that's not your fear?

02:31.693 --> 02:34.310
I'm...

02:34.488 --> 02:36.946
positively choking on it.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.072
I don't have
what you want, Constance.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.234
But you know where he is.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.867
You touched him, Mattie.

02:47.084 --> 02:50.873
As I've longed to touch him

02:51.046 --> 02:53.709
for 130 years.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.999
My beautiful boy.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.338
I could make you young again.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.469
At a cost that would make
a whore blush.

03:00.639 --> 03:03.006
I can cure that tumour
in your breast.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.678
Now, that's just rude.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.721
You want rude?

03:12.359 --> 03:15.352
Cute.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.738
But if you don't take
the carrot,

03:18.907 --> 03:21.069
you get the stick.

03:21.243 --> 03:24.236
Where's my boy?

03:24.413 --> 03:26.370
Ah! Ugh!

03:49.730 --> 03:51.972
He nearly got scalped. Ugh!

03:52.149 --> 03:54.266
And he's living in a tent
a raccoon wouldn't piss on.

03:54.443 --> 03:57.436
And I'm pretty sure he hates me,
so that's really nice.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.274
But you and Dolls,

03:59.448 --> 04:01.235
you're still working
all weekend?

04:01.408 --> 04:04.196
OK. You're asking why?

04:04.369 --> 04:06.361
Just trying to keep up, right?

04:06.538 --> 04:09.747
We're gonna track down
the last of the Seven if it kills me.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.623
You want me to ask him
to run tests

04:11.793 --> 04:13.159
on your bony little friend?

04:13.336 --> 04:14.827
Uh, no.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.791
Curtis left it to me,

04:16.964 --> 04:20.083
and if I give it to Black Badge,
I might never see it again.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.798
They say I have trust issues.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.554
You're gonna be OK without me?

04:25.724 --> 04:27.056
I'm good.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.808
I'm a happily single Virgo
with hair for days.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.890
Well, you get lonely
and you call me.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.850
OK. OK.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.945
Why wouldn't Doc
look at the photo?

04:42.407 --> 04:44.399
Because he was drunk and ornery.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.364
- More than usual.
- Mm-hm.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.030
Yes, we all know
how much you "mm-hm" Doc.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.621
Doc's the kind of bad
that's good to keep around.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.205
Wynonna, you don't
become immortal

04:55.378 --> 04:56.789
by making deals with angels.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.795
You gotta go
to the other guys for that.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.375
There.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.418
Look at his hand.

05:06.181 --> 05:09.140
Well, looks like your seventh
was quite the gentleman.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.009
Tell that to my dead sister.

05:14.397 --> 05:17.561
Look. See? There's a... spade.

05:20.612 --> 05:21.853
Nice work.

05:24.032 --> 05:27.275
- You up for some Chinese?
- Yes! Put me down for...

05:27.452 --> 05:29.239
Gong Bao chicken
with enough hot sauce

05:29.412 --> 05:31.028
to blind a T-Rex, right?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.451
It's gonna be a long night.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.242
We should make it fun.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.662
Hmm. 'Cause fun's
your middle name.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.711
I'll give you this, Mattie,

05:43.885 --> 05:47.299
you've lasted hours longer
than I thought you would.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.758
Maybe you've underestimated

05:48.932 --> 05:50.673
the good that's left
in this world.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.434
I highly doubt it.

05:53.603 --> 05:57.267
You've done your worst.
I'm not coming out.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.102
Are you sure?

06:25.051 --> 06:26.508
Go on.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.392
Now,

06:39.566 --> 06:41.353
we can finally begin.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.813
Tell me,

06:43.987 --> 06:46.695
who has the skull?

06:46.865 --> 06:51.030
The girl that's gonna
finally end you.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.660
Wonderful!

06:55.081 --> 06:56.993
Got an address?

07:44.047 --> 07:46.460
How many tiny pillows
does one girl need?

07:49.928 --> 07:51.590
Dare I ask?

07:53.640 --> 07:55.632
My uncle Curtis left it
for me to look after.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.301
Human remains, what every girl
wants in her inheritance, right?

08:08.780 --> 08:10.442
I don't think this is human.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.527
Best be careful
who knows you have that.

08:12.701 --> 08:13.908
Why?

08:14.077 --> 08:16.034
In Bobo Del Rey's camp,
there was two skeletons,

08:16.204 --> 08:17.695
one of which was missing a head.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.457
Great.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.743
My parlay with Bobo
has finished.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.754
This morning, Wynonna,
she requested assistance and...

08:26.923 --> 08:28.380
You told her to go to hell!

08:28.550 --> 08:30.587
And it was wrong of me.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.797
Too much drink, too much pride.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.381
Hey, wait a second.

08:34.556 --> 08:35.888
I want to record this

08:36.057 --> 08:39.971
so that I can replay it to you
when you're being a dick.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.977
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

08:42.147 --> 08:45.015
Your tele... telephone
is angry about something.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.524
Yeah, you need to go.
Girls only tonight.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.026
Engagement party.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.529
A chance for me to show my friends
that I'm not a freak.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.362
You hunt demonic outlaws
who rise from the dead.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.824
Gunslingers cannot foster
friendships with civilians.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.659
It just never works.

09:00.832 --> 09:04.997
See, you being here is
definitely not selling normal.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.996
So, look, the only invitation
you're getting

09:09.174 --> 09:10.881
is to move onto our land.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.544
What? Friends don't let friends
get gutted by revenants.

09:15.764 --> 09:18.507
Plus, it might be nice for us
to have some company.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.972
You know, chop wood,
help us not die.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.477
That is a generous offer,

09:23.646 --> 09:25.166
one that should come
from your sister also.

09:25.190 --> 09:28.479
Look, she might not be able
to figure you out, Doc,

09:28.651 --> 09:30.267
but Wynonna
doesn't want you dead.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.440
Well, I will consider it.

09:36.618 --> 09:39.531
I'll sleep in the barn tonight
and see if it meets my needs.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.535
Good.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.617
You should hide that cranium
somewhere safe.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.408
You wouldn't want to spoil
the revelry.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.483
They carving our chopsticks
by hand or what?

10:10.652 --> 10:12.439
Look, I need you
to listen carefully.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.229
- OK.
- There's been a change of plans.

10:15.406 --> 10:18.240
- I have to go away for a while.
- What? Where are you...?

10:18.409 --> 10:21.573
Look, I need you
to stand by for instructions.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.908
I may need you to access
my files quickly.

10:24.082 --> 10:26.199
OK, this is supremely cryptic,
even for you.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.538
Look, you can do it, Earp.
You don't need me.

10:28.711 --> 10:32.421
OK? You can break the curse,
find the last of the Seven.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.001
Believe that.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.543
OK, Dolls, do I need
to send in the cavalry?

10:37.720 --> 10:40.303
Say 'pomegranate'
if someone's got a gun on you.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.681
I owe you a nice dinner
when I get back.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.559
Double order of dumplings.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.139
Dolls?

11:09.836 --> 11:11.247
Welcome to the party!

11:11.421 --> 11:13.458
Oh, Chrissy, Steph.

11:13.631 --> 11:16.374
- Where is everybody?
- Um...

11:19.846 --> 11:21.633
Rach and Sonja bailed.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.344
They were too freaked
to come to the 'Murder House'.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.510
It's not a murder house,
it's my home.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.179
'Murder House', 'Murder Home'...

11:31.733 --> 11:33.315
I'm kidding. It looks great.

11:33.484 --> 11:34.895
Thanks.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.527
We're just surprised you ended up
moving back in with Wynonna.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.939
It just doesn't
seem healthy, Waves.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.699
What? To put the past to rest
and move on?

11:42.869 --> 11:46.408
Aren't you the ones who got me,
like, five Dr Phil books?

11:46.581 --> 11:47.822
See?

11:47.999 --> 11:49.365
Look, it's cute.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.955
You know, shabby chic.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.996
I don't really care where we are
as long as we're all together.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.039
Here's to moving on.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.917
- And Steph getting engaged.
- Yeah!

12:00.094 --> 12:02.427
Again.

12:02.597 --> 12:05.135
And to bargain-bin decorating. Ha!

12:05.308 --> 12:07.220
You know?

12:18.029 --> 12:19.816
Saturday night.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.481
I'm the town pariah
with 10 years of bad deeds

12:22.659 --> 12:24.867
and social suicides
to make up for.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.369
- What's your excuse?
- Nedley.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.154
Say no more.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.164
Bosses are the worst.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.876
Also, I'm scared
mine might be dead.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.163
Oh, kidding.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.424
Are you sure you're OK?

12:42.428 --> 12:44.511
- Mmm.
- Mm-hm.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.641
At least I'm not the only one
who wasn't invited to the party.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.222
Makes me feel better.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.558
What party?

12:56.526 --> 12:58.108
Très sparkly.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.395
Right? Thank God
he finally grew a pair

13:00.571 --> 13:02.233
and got it back from his ex.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.820
So, when are we going shopping
for the bridesmaids' dresses?

13:04.993 --> 13:07.781
We already did.
Thanksgiving weekend in the city.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.661
Merlot, shopping, spa day.

13:09.831 --> 13:12.323
- It was fabulous!
- Oh.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.742
You've been so busy
reconnecting with Wynonna.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.911
Ignoring your boyfriend...

13:17.088 --> 13:19.751
No. No. Champ and I
are... are over.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.540
- For real this time.
- Good for you.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.880
- Yeah, but Champ was so...
- What? Ignorant?

13:24.053 --> 13:26.386
- Immature?
- Indulgent.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.922
He loved you.

13:28.099 --> 13:29.931
I mean, I'm not trying
to be mean here,

13:30.101 --> 13:31.717
but there aren't exactly
a bunch of dudes

13:31.894 --> 13:33.510
lined up waiting
to date an Earp.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.356
Well...

13:36.482 --> 13:38.348
There's a man outside.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.939
Like, a cute lumberjack, cowboy,

13:41.112 --> 13:43.195
light-more-than-your-fire
kind of man!

13:43.364 --> 13:45.230
You whore!

13:45.408 --> 13:47.400
You got a stripper?!

13:47.577 --> 13:49.113
Hi.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.199
Don't be cross. I got wood.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.534
- I'll bet you do.
- Just in time.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.745
Come on in, honey.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.784
I know exactly
who she invited too.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.625
- Chrissy Nedley.
- What?! Sheriff's daughter?

14:00.798 --> 14:02.960
Mm-hm! And Stephanie Jones.

14:03.134 --> 14:06.377
You know, one time,
Stephanie told me

14:06.554 --> 14:09.092
that I should think
about getting a butt lift.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.972
What?! Your ass is like...

14:11.142 --> 14:13.304
It's top shelf, man.

14:13.478 --> 14:14.969
- It's top shelf.
- Thanks.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.813
Have I pulled Waves too close?

14:17.982 --> 14:24.024
You know, I think that Waverly
has spent her whole life

14:24.197 --> 14:27.440
tailoring who she is
to the people she's with.

14:28.659 --> 14:29.945
She's only now just starting

14:30.119 --> 14:31.530
to figure out
what she really wants.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.321
Dude, you're like
a walking bumper sticker.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.367
Who's armed!

14:37.543 --> 14:39.500
Waverly should be
hanging out with you.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.003
I agree.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.750
Who's this?

14:45.927 --> 14:47.293
Who's this lady?

14:47.470 --> 14:50.929
That is victim number three.

14:51.933 --> 14:53.595
Same guy killed three women?

14:53.768 --> 14:55.509
Yeah, killing them
was only the start.

14:55.686 --> 14:58.144
This is Joyce Arbour.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.850
She's 22.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.936
We found her Wednesday morning,

15:02.110 --> 15:03.897
and the cause of death
appears to be

15:04.070 --> 15:05.777
multiple lacerations,
but of course,

15:05.947 --> 15:08.906
the autopsy report
is practically illegible.

15:09.075 --> 15:12.318
Dolls picked a great time
to go AWOL.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.037
Um, I need to see the body.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.585
So, is this strip poker?

15:29.762 --> 15:31.594
I'm not shy.

15:31.764 --> 15:35.132
- No, you're engaged.
- We can bet pennies.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.949
I think I'm more comfortable
with pennies.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.893
Is it true that everybody
has a tell?

15:39.063 --> 15:41.646
Well, I most certainly do not.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.933
Henry has
the biggest tell of all.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.566
- You're bluffing.
- Wanna bet?

15:47.738 --> 15:51.027
I'll bet that this is the lamest
engagement party in history.

15:54.203 --> 15:57.662
Well, a hostess
is only as good as her company.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.837
Pair of sevens.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.291
Aces and eights.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.007
Well, you best rebutton
your blouse

16:12.180 --> 16:14.547
'cause all the heat's
over here on my girl.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.396
What was that?

16:33.201 --> 16:36.194
Barn door's come open is all.
I'll see to it.

16:49.383 --> 16:50.874
OK.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.109
Give me a minute.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.023
One second.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.911
She's coming.

17:20.080 --> 17:23.199
She's coming.
I-I-I t-tried to...

17:23.376 --> 17:25.163
I'll have someone
call a physician!

17:25.336 --> 17:26.667
No, no, no.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.794
This kind of wound won't heal.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.706
I'm dead already, Holliday.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.380
- Have we met?
- There isn't much time.

17:34.554 --> 17:38.673
You know Constance Clootie,
some who call the 'Stone Witch'?

17:38.849 --> 17:41.011
I am familiar with her work.

17:41.185 --> 17:44.223
Waverly Earp
has something she desires.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.138
Her boy.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.606
The skull.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.897
If she unites
what was scattered,

17:56.075 --> 17:59.819
she will let the revenants
of Wyatt Earp loose

17:59.996 --> 18:04.240
and set them free
of the Ghost River Triangle.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.160
She will kill the girl.

18:07.336 --> 18:10.044
Come the witching hour,
Constance will be upon you.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.921
Oh, I'll be waiting for her.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.957
No! She's too strong.

18:14.135 --> 18:17.378
You must warn Waverly,
and you take her away.

18:17.555 --> 18:19.262
You go!

18:20.433 --> 18:22.220
I waited three lifetimes

18:22.393 --> 18:24.510
dreaming of ways
to kill that witch.

18:24.687 --> 18:28.055
- There's only one way to do so.
- Well, you tell me.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.565
First, I need your word.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.769
That you will take Waverly
and you will flee.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.312
Now.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.822
You save your vendetta
for another night.

18:37.992 --> 18:39.483
Oh, I so swear.

18:39.660 --> 18:42.653
OK.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.617
First,

18:44.790 --> 18:47.703
you need to collect
what is of her flesh -

18:47.877 --> 18:49.869
hair, blood.

18:50.046 --> 18:54.962
Dipped in it, this gallows silk
will lessen her powers.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.545
It will bind her.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.211
But you need to be patient
when you hunt her.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.301
She's vulnerable
only in the time

19:02.475 --> 19:04.683
following the witching hour.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.436
The Reckoning.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.516
No.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.406
Doc?

19:25.289 --> 19:27.531
Oh, it ain't nothing
but a north wind

19:27.708 --> 19:29.324
and some sneaky whiskey jacks.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.494
Now, I believe

19:31.671 --> 19:35.039
I was about to give your friends
a lesson in bluffing.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.800
Oh. Eugh.

19:45.267 --> 19:48.101
Yeah, they say
you get used to the smell.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.013
I spent a summer's probation
on roadkill removal.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.102
Pfft! This is nothing.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.438
And here she is.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.402
Joyce Arbour.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.753
She kind of looks
like you, Wynonna.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.963
Jesus Christ! Who did this?

20:21.137 --> 20:22.628
Someone who knew
what they were doing.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.762
Dude! This is a morgue!

20:24.932 --> 20:26.969
Wear a bell or something, OK?

20:27.143 --> 20:30.136
Sorry. Once a ninja,
always a ninja.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.350
Plus I forget I'm wearing
these cotton balls for shoes.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.732
They help absorb the smell.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.234
But you two pretty ladies
don't care about that.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.943
Um, I'm Dr Reggie,
the unlucky SOB

20:42.116 --> 20:44.324
who has to make sure
the dead don't rise again.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.825
You suck at your job.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.362
- Uh, excuse me?
- Never mind.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.997
Did you do this autopsy report?

20:52.001 --> 20:54.368
Uh... if I'd done this,

20:54.545 --> 20:55.985
I wouldn't have
misspelled 'breasts'.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.038
I can tell you something
about the body.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.831
Did my own examination.

21:00.009 --> 21:04.049
Anything unusual or creepy
about the wounds

21:04.221 --> 21:05.803
or the way she died?

21:05.973 --> 21:08.841
Well, she died
because humans can't survive

21:09.018 --> 21:10.304
when their organs are removed.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.140
She was alive
when he took them out?

21:12.313 --> 21:14.805
Correct. But the incision
isn't what killed her.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.269
He drugged her,
hooked her up to an IV,

21:17.443 --> 21:19.560
a blood bag,
just like any surgeon would

21:19.737 --> 21:21.524
doing open-heart
or intestinal surgery.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.405
But here is the uber-weird part.

21:25.409 --> 21:28.902
The wounds were cauterised
as they were made.

21:29.914 --> 21:32.998
So he cut her open
with something hot?

21:33.167 --> 21:34.703
Like lightsaber hot.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.292
Hellfire hot.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.967
<i>I need your word</i>

21:45.137 --> 21:47.754
<i>that you will take Waverly
and you will flee.</i>

21:47.932 --> 21:49.423
<i>Now.</i>

21:49.600 --> 21:51.683
<i>You save your vendetta
for another night.</i>

21:51.852 --> 21:53.639
<i>Oh, I so swear.</i>

21:56.774 --> 21:59.767
Whoo-hoo!

22:04.740 --> 22:07.027
Alright, so you remove
the organs

22:07.201 --> 22:09.001
if you're gonna sell them
on the black market.

22:09.036 --> 22:12.245
Why would you take 'em out
and then put 'em back in?

22:12.414 --> 22:14.747
Maybe somebody
was looking for something.

22:14.917 --> 22:18.331
- You keep looking at her neck.
- Yeah, there's a welt.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.130
Dude, I saw on the photos
it's the shape of a spade,

22:22.299 --> 22:23.756
like on a deck of cards.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.252
Sweet crickets!
I missed that entirely.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.761
What would have caused that?

22:28.931 --> 22:31.844
Well, she was hit by something
in the shape of a spade, right?

22:32.017 --> 22:33.633
I mean, sure, yeah.

22:33.811 --> 22:35.894
Or it could have been
prolonged pressure.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.396
Did, uh, you study forensics?

22:45.698 --> 22:47.485
Someone just went
into the cooler.

22:47.658 --> 22:49.320
You guys come alone?

22:49.493 --> 22:50.825
I don't know, did we?

22:50.995 --> 22:54.488
There more than one way
of getting inside the cooler?

22:54.665 --> 22:56.907
Uh, yeah. Rear exit.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.827
Alright, I got it.

23:00.004 --> 23:01.996
Don't shoot me, Earp.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.760
Nicole!

23:13.934 --> 23:16.768
OK, I get it, right?
MacGilly sent you.

23:16.937 --> 23:20.180
Haze the new guy? Real original.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.204
The door was locked.
I couldn't get in.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.665
Jesus, Wynonna.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.667
I can't beg your forgiveness,

23:48.844 --> 23:52.303
but I can assure you the best way
to protect Waverly Earp

23:52.473 --> 23:55.181
is to put that witch
in the ground.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.732
Did you make that cake?

24:04.902 --> 24:06.643
Yeah, it was
my aunt's recipe and then...

24:06.820 --> 24:09.312
What's upstairs?
Wynonna's grow op?

24:09.490 --> 24:12.073
- We don't go up there!
- Oh, jeez.

24:12.242 --> 24:15.861
Relax. Honestly, Waverly,
you've gotten so weird.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.745
Sorry.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.781
It's just we use it
for storage, that's all.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.291
Uh-huh? Whatever.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.543
I'm gonna go bum
a cigarette off Henry.

24:26.423 --> 24:29.791
- Special delivery.
- OMG, bitch!

24:29.969 --> 24:32.302
- You did hire a stripper?!
- Uh, no.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.929
- I-I just have a package.
- Is it a big package?

24:37.685 --> 24:40.348
- Whoo-hoo!
- Uh! Uh! Uh!

24:42.106 --> 24:44.849
OK, Magic Mike,
show us your moves.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.891
Take it off!

24:51.448 --> 24:52.609
Take your pants off!

24:52.783 --> 24:55.992
Whoo!

25:07.506 --> 25:09.543
I think he's local.

25:18.225 --> 25:21.514
This gallows silk
will lessen her powers.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.098
Bind her.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.559
She's vulnerable
only in the time

25:25.733 --> 25:27.690
following the witching hour.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.227
Oh, I've waited long enough.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.449
Ugh!

25:49.715 --> 25:52.082
Where is the skull, little girl?

25:55.345 --> 25:57.302
- Put her down!
- That is not sexy!

25:57.473 --> 25:59.931
Waverly!

26:05.439 --> 26:07.556
Where's Chrissy?

26:14.948 --> 26:17.782
So I guess this means you got
the promotion, Agent Lucado.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.487
Sit down, Dolls.

26:28.212 --> 26:30.625
Look, I know things
have started slow.

26:32.049 --> 26:34.541
But I've submitted dozens,
dozens of detailed reports.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.630
Wherein we learned
your only recruits

26:36.804 --> 26:40.593
are a cocktail waitress
and a criminal.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.473
Yeah, and that criminal's
Wynonna Earp.

26:42.643 --> 26:44.555
"Give me three months,"
you said,

26:44.728 --> 26:46.765
"and I'll deliver evidence
of a demon conspiracy"

26:46.939 --> 26:49.022
"the likes of which
Black Badge has never seen."

26:49.191 --> 26:50.932
Your three months are up,

26:51.110 --> 26:53.477
and I've seen
all of this before.

26:53.654 --> 26:54.986
Sir, if I may...

26:55.155 --> 26:57.693
I have a follow-up examination
with the board.

26:57.866 --> 27:02.201
I'll return later with
your new orders and deployment.

27:02.371 --> 27:04.158
You speak Swedish, right?

27:04.331 --> 27:06.288
Look, I've got specimens
in the lab right now.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.792
Human remains that have been
mummified by revenant saliva.

27:10.963 --> 27:14.081
And do we think they will be
any less disappointing?

27:24.768 --> 27:27.681
Nobody keeps booze
in here, Wynonna!

27:27.855 --> 27:30.848
Except you. You want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

27:31.024 --> 27:33.107
Yeah. Dry morgue air
is murder on the schnoz.

27:33.277 --> 27:34.358
Bullshit!

27:34.528 --> 27:38.112
I think somebody's trying
to scare you, toy with you. Why?

27:38.282 --> 27:40.148
I picked up this case,
like, an hour ago.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.237
- How could...
- It be connected to you?

27:42.411 --> 27:45.529
Yeah, I would really like
to know that too.

27:45.706 --> 27:48.119
People getting eaten by something?
Call Wynonna.

27:48.292 --> 27:50.659
Guy gets murdered
by a man in the mirror?

27:50.836 --> 27:52.577
Yeah, Wynonna to the rescue.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.666
Black Badge specialises in cases

27:54.840 --> 27:58.880
that are, uh, too complex
for rookie flatfoots,

27:59.052 --> 28:01.294
so it makes sense
that you're a bit confused.

28:01.471 --> 28:03.804
- I'm not.
- Alternately...

28:05.392 --> 28:07.554
I don't suppose you have
a deck of playing cards

28:07.728 --> 28:09.845
in this utility belt, huh?

28:10.022 --> 28:11.138
Excuse me?

28:11.315 --> 28:14.399
How do I know you didn't double back
to mess with the body?

28:14.568 --> 28:16.855
Yeah, you're awful interested
in me and my sister.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.237
Maybe I should be grilling
the shit out of you.

28:19.406 --> 28:20.897
Maybe you're the crazy one.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.565
You of all people
should know better

28:22.743 --> 28:24.860
than to try to make me
question my sanity.

28:50.312 --> 28:53.805
I just killed someone!

28:55.651 --> 28:57.358
It was him or you.

29:01.949 --> 29:03.565
What were you shooting at
out there?

29:03.742 --> 29:05.028
The Stone Witch.

29:05.202 --> 29:07.194
The woman who made me what I am.

29:07.371 --> 29:08.578
Constance Clootie?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.989
Funny how the woman
that you were looking for

29:11.166 --> 29:12.828
happens to find you here.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.414
Your 'Murder House's
reception is balls!

29:20.259 --> 29:23.047
- After she made me ageless...
- Ageless?!

29:23.220 --> 29:25.382
She stuck me
at the bottom of an old well

29:25.555 --> 29:27.137
to spend my immortality...

29:27.307 --> 29:28.969
- Immorta...?
- ..rotting in the ground.

29:29.142 --> 29:31.600
And then Wynonna showed up
to retrieve Wyatt's gun

29:31.770 --> 29:34.228
and left me a rope a-danglin',
and here I am.

29:34.398 --> 29:36.515
Dangling? Are you both high?

29:36.692 --> 29:39.685
OK. Well, she might be able
to get onto our land,

29:39.861 --> 29:43.070
but she's not coming into
our house unless we invite her.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.372
You are just as mental
as your sister!

29:53.542 --> 29:55.750
Yes, OK! Stephanie,
you're right, it's all true!

29:55.919 --> 29:57.751
I am a freak! Wynonna's a freak!

29:57.921 --> 29:59.787
- Doc's a freak!
- Hey now!

29:59.965 --> 30:02.207
But I'm a freak who knows
that the most lethal place

30:02.384 --> 30:04.797
to stab someone bigger than you
is through the ear.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.053
Yes, I'm the freak
who knows that witches

30:07.222 --> 30:09.542
can't cross lines of salt,
which is pretty handy right now.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.974
And I'm the freak
who, six months ago,

30:12.144 --> 30:14.010
would have been too polite
to mention

30:14.187 --> 30:16.679
that that big old diamond
on your finger,

30:16.857 --> 30:20.396
not only is it cubic zirconium,
but it is ugly as shit!

30:21.820 --> 30:23.231
You bitch!

30:23.405 --> 30:25.317
So for once in your life,

30:25.490 --> 30:28.073
please, just be smarter than you look
and just shut up!

30:32.706 --> 30:35.414
- What the hell now!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

30:36.626 --> 30:38.458
You can't kill him
'cause he's already dead!

30:38.628 --> 30:40.836
- Door!
- Oh, my God!

30:44.217 --> 30:45.799
OK.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.803
OK, so she can make zombies.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.589
Yeah, that's... that's neat.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.893
Wait, you said
Bobo has two skeletons,

30:56.063 --> 30:57.975
and the skull
is part of one of them.

30:58.148 --> 30:59.639
Oh, she's trying
to resurrect them!

30:59.816 --> 31:01.102
Where did you hide it?

31:01.276 --> 31:03.393
No, I'm not supposed
to give it to anybody, OK?

31:03.570 --> 31:05.232
Look, I'm its keeper.
It's somewhere safe.

31:05.405 --> 31:07.988
What a pity we can't say
the same things about ourselves.

31:08.158 --> 31:10.992
Screw you Satanist party poopers!

31:11.161 --> 31:13.073
No, wait! Stephanie, don't!

31:13.246 --> 31:14.578
Stephanie!

31:19.669 --> 31:21.831
- Steph! No!
- It's too late.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.792
It's too late.

31:30.138 --> 31:33.006
Christ, she got
the lady blacksmith.

31:41.024 --> 31:42.686
Oh, my God!
And we gave her Steph.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.600
That was unfortunate.

31:44.778 --> 31:46.986
Alright. OK. Oh, God!

31:52.244 --> 31:56.068
Hi, Dolls.
Uh, shit's really hit the fan.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.953
This last guy,
the last of the Seven,

32:00.127 --> 32:01.993
he's just... he's toying with me.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.787
It's like when I'm in
the presence of his...

32:05.841 --> 32:09.334
work, it's just all
goose bumps and nosebleeds,

32:09.511 --> 32:12.629
and I could really use
your help right now.

32:14.474 --> 32:17.717
It's Wynonna by the way.
Wynonna Earp.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.598
Dolls! Are you OK?

32:23.775 --> 32:26.358
Wave? Wave, slow down.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.855
What do you mean,
you killed a stripper?

32:31.950 --> 32:34.067
- OK, Wynonna's on her way.
- Splendid!

32:34.244 --> 32:36.031
- How far are we from the jeep?
- Too far.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.116
They'd be on us as quick
as devils on sin.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.622
Dynamite -
now, in my experience,

32:39.791 --> 32:41.227
dynamite solves
all manners of problems.

32:41.251 --> 32:42.811
They can't kill us
if they're in pieces.

32:42.878 --> 32:45.106
Oh, yeah, sure, sure, dynamite.
I'll get some from the kitchen.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.247
No, Doc! These things
are under a spell, OK?

32:47.424 --> 32:49.381
They're puppets.
We have to cut their strings.

32:49.551 --> 32:51.838
Well, their puppet master
is a witch who will kill you

32:52.012 --> 32:53.469
soon as look at you, or worse.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.300
Doc, why did she
give you immortality

32:55.474 --> 32:56.931
only to throw you down a well?

32:57.100 --> 32:58.511
I...

32:58.685 --> 33:00.017
Oh, God! Ah!

33:00.187 --> 33:03.180
OK, we... uh, we have
some coyote traps in the attic.

33:03.356 --> 33:05.396
- Maybe some more shotgun shells.
- Desperate times.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.350
You toss them down to me,
then you stay put.

33:07.527 --> 33:09.327
We'll have a better chance
from higher ground.

33:09.446 --> 33:12.314
Doc... If they break through,
I'll be hot on your heels.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.904
- Now get!
- OK.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.491
OK.

33:43.396 --> 33:46.104
Oh, my God, Chrissy! Jesus!

33:46.274 --> 33:47.936
I'm sorry. I know
upstairs is off-limits.

33:48.109 --> 33:50.021
Dad always said,
"Just put as many people"

33:50.195 --> 33:52.027
"between you and the intruders
as you can."

33:53.365 --> 33:55.106
I'm done with this.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.990
This is Willa's room.

33:57.160 --> 34:00.153
- I mean WAS.
- I'm so sorry, Waves.

34:00.330 --> 34:01.662
Was Willa's room.

34:01.831 --> 34:04.164
Did you call my dad?
Did you call the police?

34:04.334 --> 34:05.791
Wynonna's on her way.

34:05.961 --> 34:07.247
She's the best chance we got.

34:07.420 --> 34:10.128
OK, just please, please,
just trust me, Chrissy.

34:10.297 --> 34:11.914
Jeez.

34:12.092 --> 34:14.630
OK, I do. I always have.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.465
Do you remember
that time when we were 12

34:16.638 --> 34:18.594
and the boys tried to lock me
in the porta-potty?

34:18.764 --> 34:21.007
And you, you took a stick
and you came out

34:21.184 --> 34:23.103
and you started whacking
the leader in the balls.

34:23.186 --> 34:24.927
Champ Hardy.

34:25.105 --> 34:27.722
God, he was a dick
and three quarters back then.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.061
You never stayed out
of a fight, Waves.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.773
You were the one who always knew
how to win it.

34:32.946 --> 34:34.733
By any means necessary.

34:36.199 --> 34:38.565
Willa would be really proud
of her little sister.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.735
I know Wynonna is.

34:42.496 --> 34:44.284
Stone Witch.

34:44.456 --> 34:47.746
She's just another bully.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.386
She said she's sorry she lied.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.802
And then she just left
out the window.

35:06.813 --> 35:09.726
Chrissy, what was in the box?

35:15.780 --> 35:20.024
Curious. I gave them
no command to spare you.

35:20.201 --> 35:22.443
Give me my boy.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.329
He's not just your boy anymore.

35:25.498 --> 35:28.115
The Blacksmith bound him to me.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.829
Clever.

35:30.837 --> 35:33.796
But will he protect
your friends?

35:33.965 --> 35:36.298
What? No.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.084
Wait, no.

35:38.261 --> 35:40.844
All I want to know
is why you trapped Doc,

35:41.014 --> 35:42.471
why you hate him.

35:42.641 --> 35:45.554
Because he was loved
by Wyatt Earp,

35:45.727 --> 35:49.266
and Wyatt Earp
slaughtered my sons.

35:49.439 --> 35:51.146
No, if Wyatt killed them,

35:51.316 --> 35:53.808
then they would have resurrected
like the other revenants.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.726
Revenants are human.

35:55.904 --> 35:57.315
My boys were...

35:57.489 --> 35:59.446
are...

35:59.616 --> 36:01.107
something more.

36:03.870 --> 36:05.156
Well, that explains
the overbite.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.413
There's an evil in this world

36:07.582 --> 36:09.494
far greater than your revenants,

36:09.668 --> 36:11.500
Waverly Earp.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.912
- It's coming.
- Yeah?

36:14.089 --> 36:16.832
Well, then we'll stop it. OK?

36:17.008 --> 36:19.500
Haven't you read
a romance novel lately?

36:20.595 --> 36:22.211
Heroes always win.

36:22.389 --> 36:24.551
Oh, you want to be a hero?

36:24.724 --> 36:26.056
Very well, give me the skull

36:26.226 --> 36:29.594
or I will take it
from your lifeless hands.

36:29.771 --> 36:31.808
Come and get it.

36:31.981 --> 36:34.940
- Aaah!
- Nooo!

36:36.611 --> 36:38.819
- Arggh!
- You will die!

36:38.988 --> 36:40.195
Someone will.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.197
She's mine!

36:47.706 --> 36:50.073
Damn her to hell and below.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.880
Want to tell me
what that was all about?

36:59.050 --> 37:02.009
That was my Seven.

37:02.178 --> 37:05.012
And probably my greatest chance
of bringing her down.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.264
You best see to your sister.

37:10.395 --> 37:13.559
Wave. Hey, you OK?

37:16.901 --> 37:19.518
I'll never play piano again.

37:19.696 --> 37:21.483
Do you play piano?

37:22.824 --> 37:24.315
- No.
- No.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.203
That was really brave.

37:30.373 --> 37:31.830
Stupid...

37:33.793 --> 37:35.500
but very brave.

37:51.853 --> 37:54.095
I have something I need to say.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.766
Mattie tried to warn you,
and you didn't listen.

37:59.861 --> 38:03.525
Because you knew that if
you told me about Constance,

38:03.698 --> 38:05.655
I'd take the skull and leave.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.612
You used us as bait.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.574
The witch is all I want
in this world.

38:10.747 --> 38:13.239
Thinking of her at the end of a gun
is the only thing

38:13.416 --> 38:15.328
that kept me alive in that well,
kept me sane.

38:15.502 --> 38:19.246
I'm starting to think
sanity's overrated.

38:19.422 --> 38:22.039
See, whereas I underestimated.

38:24.135 --> 38:27.253
I mean, I forgot
about the other stuff,

38:27.430 --> 38:29.262
the living stuff.

38:29.432 --> 38:32.049
I understand if you hate me.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.184
I don't hate you, Doc.

38:34.354 --> 38:38.223
You're the scorpion,
I'm the frog.

38:38.399 --> 38:40.356
I'm not sure I follow.

38:41.569 --> 38:42.901
Just google it.

38:43.071 --> 38:45.814
I suppose this bears repeating
to Wynonna.

38:45.990 --> 38:49.358
At least be man enough
to tell her yourself.

38:49.536 --> 38:52.279
You do love her after all.

38:52.455 --> 38:54.162
Love?

38:55.583 --> 38:57.575
Well, that's a bit rich.

38:57.752 --> 38:59.960
There.

39:00.129 --> 39:03.213
You wanted to know
what your tell at poker is?

39:03.383 --> 39:05.340
Simple.

39:07.720 --> 39:11.509
You're always, always lying.

39:33.329 --> 39:34.615
Your sister OK?

39:34.789 --> 39:36.781
Yeah, well, she's being Waverly.

39:36.958 --> 39:40.372
Yeah, well, Chrissy says
she scissored a stripper.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.207
So?

39:42.380 --> 39:45.088
Any idea why your homestead
was targeted?

39:45.258 --> 39:47.466
I mean, besides the fact
that it's yours.

39:48.511 --> 39:50.468
You know what,
we should get some breakfast.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.129
I could murder
a stack of pancakes.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.720
Then we'll talk, really talk.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.600
OK, you're gonna
help me understand

39:56.769 --> 39:58.681
why some of these cases
are a little too complex

39:58.855 --> 40:00.391
for local flatfoots?

40:00.565 --> 40:02.807
I'll do my best.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.902
Your boss gonna be OK with that?

40:09.115 --> 40:10.777
My boss isn't here.

40:10.950 --> 40:13.693
- OK.
- Guess you're my ride.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.041
- Come here, sweetie.
- Thanks, Waves.

40:28.217 --> 40:29.674
Let's get you warm.

40:34.515 --> 40:35.847
- Eight hours!
- Mm-hm.

40:36.017 --> 40:37.974
Most people would have left.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.010
You should know by now
I'm not most people.

40:40.188 --> 40:41.019
Mm-hm.

40:41.189 --> 40:44.273
As expected, your samples
didn't prove conclusively

40:44.442 --> 40:46.482
there are demons in Purgatory,
and they sure as hell

40:46.611 --> 40:48.131
don't prove the existence
of revenants.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.986
If you knew what we were
dealing with...

40:50.156 --> 40:51.772
Yes. If I knew.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.943
But it seems you can't show me.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.826
I'm shutting your division down.

40:56.996 --> 41:00.205
We will, of course,
have to deal with your recruits.

41:00.375 --> 41:04.494
Just how much intel have they
been privy to, would you say?

41:05.546 --> 41:07.538
- I have something else.
- Dolls, enough!

41:07.715 --> 41:11.083
Not a revenant or a demon.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.922
Never before documented.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.469
I'm listening.

41:52.969 --> 41:54.380
She's mine!

41:56.014 --> 41:58.427
Well, you learn something new
every day.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.927
Wynonna!
