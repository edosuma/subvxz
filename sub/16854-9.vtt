somewhat interested,
thinking of his wife.

08:02.944 --> 08:05.438
Are there moral consequences
for our actions?

08:05.480 --> 08:08.973
Is monogamy even natural,
fertility outdated?

08:09.017 --> 08:12.685
Thinking of...
hearing mother's voice.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.280
Losing erection.

DORI:
Oh, no, no, no.

08:15.510 --> 08:16.957
Not worth it. Into the O.R.

08:16.991 --> 08:19.326
[ Indistinct conversation ]

08:19.360 --> 08:21.527
What is going on here?

08:21.562 --> 08:22.695
DORI:
I'm so sorry.

08:22.763 --> 08:24.497
I did everything I could
to stop him,

08:24.531 --> 08:27.000
even the "boob out of the scrubs"
routine.

08:27.034 --> 08:29.943
Do I smell
a 1991 Sempia Bordeaux?

08:29.978 --> 08:30.996
SY:
No.

08:31.021 --> 08:33.039
Are you doing a wine tasting
in the middle of an operation?

08:33.073 --> 08:34.640
SY:
It's my fault, sir.

08:34.674 --> 08:37.844
VALERIE: Oh, finally, you admit it.
Was that so hard?

08:37.910 --> 08:40.546
This is fantastic.

08:40.614 --> 08:43.049
- SY: What?
- Wine loosens the senses.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.884
It releases the inhibitions.

08:44.918 --> 08:48.088
I do my best writing
when I'm wasted.

08:48.122 --> 08:49.615
I'm drunk right now.

08:49.650 --> 08:51.821
- Sempia me, please?
- SY: Yes.

08:51.856 --> 08:53.759
VALERIE:
Ohh...

08:53.794 --> 08:55.941
VALERIE: We nicked her vesica.

Stop the blood!

08:57.564 --> 08:59.466
VALERIE:
I don't want to do this anymore.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.535
VALERIE: Let's play light as a feather,
stiff as a board.

09:02.569 --> 09:04.003
OWEN: All you have to do
is clamp it.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.239
SY:
A show of hands...

09:05.313 --> 09:07.707
Does anybody know
what they're doing here?

09:07.774 --> 09:10.510
Well, I'm sure there's somebody
who can do the operation.

09:10.544 --> 09:11.644
SY:
Well, there is one doctor,

09:11.678 --> 09:14.184
Dr. Owen Maestro,
but he's on a day off.

09:14.219 --> 09:16.782
- GLENN: I'll do it.
- SY: No, Glenn. You can't do it.

09:16.817 --> 09:18.918
You're a plastic surgeon.
Now wait a minute.

09:18.952 --> 09:20.720
I'm gonna call Owen
on his phone.

09:20.754 --> 09:21.721
[ Cellphone ringing ]

09:21.755 --> 09:23.346
What is that?
[ Ringing continues ]

09:23.590 --> 09:25.092
OWEN:
It's Owen's phone,

09:25.203 --> 09:28.828
a.k.a. my phone because,
you see...

09:28.862 --> 09:31.564
[ Grunts ]

09:31.598 --> 09:33.599
I'm Dr. Owen Maestro.

09:33.667 --> 09:34.867
[ Clears throat ]

[ Normal voice ]
I am Dr. Owen Maestro,

certified in "laparostomy"

09:39.607 --> 09:43.443
and in an enormous amount of pain
in my face area right now.

09:43.511 --> 09:45.860
SY:
You changed places with Glenn

09:45.895 --> 09:48.714
in order to do an
unauthorized shift switch?

09:48.782 --> 09:51.943
OWEN: I had to.
Glenn needed this day off

09:52.017 --> 09:54.098
for a reason that I can't remember
right now.

09:54.133 --> 09:56.997
I'll face the consequences later
but right now,

09:57.032 --> 09:58.624
a child is suffering.

09:58.659 --> 10:00.726
Clamp! I need a clamp!

10:00.761 --> 10:02.165
- DORI: Clamp!
- OWEN: A clamp.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.004
DORI: Okay, okay,
I'm getting it.

10:04.068 --> 10:05.198

Is that it?

Done.

Okay, here.

10:11.705 --> 10:12.838
SAL:
Attention, staff.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.174
This might be the wine talking,

10:14.208 --> 10:17.177
but I love living in a bottle
until I get poured. That is all.

10:17.244 --> 10:20.699
SY: Yes, yes, Owen.
You did save that girl's life.

10:20.734 --> 10:24.370
But you did pose as another physician.
That is a felony.

10:24.405 --> 10:25.918
GLENN: Hey.
What's going on, guys?

10:25.986 --> 10:28.188
OWEN: You missed a lot, buddy,
but long story short,

10:28.222 --> 10:29.855
looks like
we're both going to jail.

10:29.890 --> 10:32.592

Ah, figures.
