WEBVTT

00:24.208 --> 00:26.958
<i>And now the news from Europe.</i>

00:26.958 --> 00:29.500
<i>With British forces
withdrawn from the continent,</i>

00:29.500 --> 00:33.625
<i>the Nazis presently command
the English Channel, the Atlantic coast,</i>

00:33.625 --> 00:35.083
<i>and the north of France,</i>

00:35.083 --> 00:40.250
<i>forcing multitudes to flee Paris
for the unoccupied zone in the south.</i>

00:46.500 --> 00:51.583
<i>The last free port of Marseille
teems with refugees from all over Europe,</i>

00:51.583 --> 00:56.500
<i>desperately seeking travel visas
and funds to depart for the new world.</i>

01:53.458 --> 01:55.708
Whoo!

01:56.458 --> 01:57.791
Whoo!

02:03.333 --> 02:04.791
Whoo!

02:11.916 --> 02:12.750
Ah!

02:40.500 --> 02:41.416
Mm.

02:43.625 --> 02:46.000
This came for you today
in my diplomatic pouch.

02:46.708 --> 02:47.916
Go ahead. It won't bite.

02:54.666 --> 02:55.500
Hm.

02:56.833 --> 03:00.000
My father is demanding
that I come home to Chicago.

03:02.375 --> 03:04.875
He's bought me a ticket
for tomorrow night.

03:04.875 --> 03:08.791
He has been asking nicely
ever since the Nazis marched into Paris.

03:08.791 --> 03:11.541
He's done being nice.
He's threatening to cut me off.

03:11.541 --> 03:15.458
Can you blame him? His only daughter
gallivanting around wartime Marseille

03:15.458 --> 03:16.833
with Hitler's most wanted?

03:16.833 --> 03:18.625
I'm trying to save their lives.

03:18.625 --> 03:22.916
Come on, Ms. Gold. Be good.
Go home. Settle down with a nice guy.

03:22.916 --> 03:25.958
- Well, I don't see you rushing home.
- I'm here for work.

03:26.583 --> 03:27.500
And so am I.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.625
These are some of Europe's finest minds,
Mr. Patterson,

03:31.625 --> 03:33.750
and America would be lucky to have them.

03:33.750 --> 03:36.708
- You know what makes America great?
- Please remind me.

03:36.708 --> 03:40.958
The hammer. There's 50 different kinds
of hammer in the United States.

03:40.958 --> 03:43.375
- Fifty.
- What was wrong with the first one?

03:43.375 --> 03:46.625
Nothing.
And they're already working on the 51st.

03:46.625 --> 03:48.333
That's American ingenuity for you.

03:48.333 --> 03:51.416
These European intellectuals are
just staring at their own navels.

03:51.416 --> 03:52.458
Says you.

03:53.041 --> 03:56.500
Do you really wanna help
that badly? Send money from Chicago.

03:58.416 --> 04:00.916
Will you please speak to my father for me?

04:01.791 --> 04:03.875
He thinks you're a man with common sense.

04:05.208 --> 04:06.375
Maybe.

04:07.583 --> 04:10.083
If you'll excuse me,
I have to powder my nose.

04:23.250 --> 04:26.333
Here. Take it.
The boy didn't even touch it.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.708
Are you trying to get out of Marseille?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.125
Isn't everybody?

04:35.333 --> 04:37.041
We both got away from Paris.

04:37.541 --> 04:41.125
I can get you on the boat
to New York tomorrow. The MS Rex.

04:42.625 --> 04:43.958
You can get visas?

04:43.958 --> 04:46.583
No, but if you go at 6:00 a.m.,

04:46.583 --> 04:49.000
they will be loading cargo
in the back of the ship.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.166
You talk to Lionel, and he can get you on.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.416
As stowaways?

04:52.416 --> 04:53.500
Yes.

04:54.416 --> 04:56.125
I'm traveling with my brother.

04:56.125 --> 04:57.375
Um...

04:57.375 --> 05:00.166
Then I... I'll pay Lionel for both of you.

05:01.208 --> 05:02.250
Why?

05:02.250 --> 05:05.041
I have the money.
I can do it. Does it matter why?

05:05.041 --> 05:08.916
Here. If you need to reach me,
you can find me here.

05:12.666 --> 05:15.000
I'm working with
the Emergency Rescue Committee

05:15.000 --> 05:16.750
at the Hotel Splendide.

05:19.666 --> 05:23.541
If you clean yourself up, you can go up
on the deck once the ship sets sail,

05:23.541 --> 05:25.208
and no one will notice.

05:42.583 --> 05:45.000
- Did you--
- Oh, I just fixed my hair.

05:47.500 --> 05:48.458
Do you like it?

05:53.166 --> 05:55.166
Good morning.
- Good morning.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.666
Good morning, Paul.
- Mary Jayne.

06:11.666 --> 06:14.000
Special delivery for Mademoiselle Gold!

06:15.458 --> 06:19.125
Can you get this to Lionel?
I have two more for the boat.

06:19.125 --> 06:20.125
No problem.

06:25.916 --> 06:28.041
Dagobert.

06:28.041 --> 06:29.791
Hello.
- Hello.

06:38.291 --> 06:40.541
Here's your lunch.
- I thank you.

06:41.791 --> 06:42.791
Thank you.

07:02.083 --> 07:03.625
- Varian Fry.

07:05.416 --> 07:06.916
This way.
Thanks.

07:09.416 --> 07:11.291
How goes
your Rescue Committee?

07:11.291 --> 07:12.708
<i>Emergency</i> Rescue Committee.

07:12.708 --> 07:15.416
Knights on shining horses.
Or is it shining knights on...

07:15.416 --> 07:16.708
I always forget.

07:16.708 --> 07:18.583
I saw your Miss Gold today.

07:18.583 --> 07:21.041
Miss Gold.
She's indispensable to our operation.

07:21.041 --> 07:24.000
A spoiled young lady
with no clue about the real world.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.708
Her daddy's money is indispensable.
Let's hope he keeps it coming, hm?

07:31.625 --> 07:32.500
Mr. Patterson,

07:33.791 --> 07:37.375
why are you stonewalling
Mr. Benjamin's visa request?

07:37.375 --> 07:39.291
This is a matter of life and death.

07:39.291 --> 07:40.416
It always is.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.958
People here have been
killing since the Trojan War.

07:46.208 --> 07:50.041
The Trojan War was fought for love.
The Nazis are driven only by hate--

07:50.041 --> 07:51.916
You're a guest here, Mr. Fry.

07:52.458 --> 07:56.125
The United States has a neutral position
in this war. Don't forget that.

07:56.125 --> 08:00.625
You and I are in wartime France
at the pleasure of the French authorities.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.625
Most Americans
wouldn't come here to begin with.

08:03.625 --> 08:05.666
My own wife refused to join me.

08:05.666 --> 08:06.750
So,

08:07.291 --> 08:10.041
what are you really doing here, Mr. Fry?

08:10.625 --> 08:11.791
You bored at home?

08:13.333 --> 08:14.166
Unhappy marriage?

08:19.541 --> 08:24.583
Innocent people's lives are being ruined,
Mr. Patterson.

08:25.541 --> 08:27.791
They're being wrongfully incarcerated.

08:28.458 --> 08:29.375
Even killed.

08:30.166 --> 08:32.791
Last week, two more people on my list
committed suicide.

08:34.958 --> 08:38.625
These refugees need help,
and no one else is lifting a finger.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.958
I don't need a better reason.

08:43.916 --> 08:47.375
Well, as an American, I expect you
to behave yourself in Marseille.

08:47.875 --> 08:50.791
Do that for me,
and I'll figure out Mr. Benjamin's visa.

08:55.000 --> 08:55.958
Thank you.

09:08.375 --> 09:11.583
Please leave the food outside. Thank you.

09:16.416 --> 09:18.791
Mr. Benjamin, it's me. Mary Jayne.

09:20.208 --> 09:22.583
Now please release me from this purgatory.

09:22.583 --> 09:26.250
The MS Rex is in the harbor,
ready to take you to New York.

09:29.583 --> 09:30.833
What are you doing?

09:30.833 --> 09:33.500
No, Mr. Benjamin,
it smells like a hash den in here.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.750
If the French find me here,
they'll send me to the prison camps,

09:36.750 --> 09:38.166
and I can't go back there.

09:38.166 --> 09:39.583
I understand.

09:40.250 --> 09:41.250
I really do.

09:44.416 --> 09:47.375
My Berlin was a paradise.
Now they've destroyed it.

09:47.958 --> 09:50.208
Please don't touch that.

09:50.958 --> 09:54.000
It's the only thing
that I have left from my past.

09:58.041 --> 09:59.416
You know, you're lucky.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.333
You can go back home.

10:04.708 --> 10:07.000
Well, I don't know about that.

10:34.583 --> 10:35.416
Come.

10:39.583 --> 10:40.416
Come.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.166
<i>Gut shabbes.</i>

10:55.625 --> 10:57.541
Let's share my challah.

10:57.541 --> 10:58.791
Challah?

10:59.458 --> 11:01.750
I thought you were Jews,
like everyone here.

11:01.750 --> 11:02.833
We are.

11:03.916 --> 11:07.416
We were. We just never really...

11:09.500 --> 11:11.458
Our parents left all that behind.

11:11.458 --> 11:14.291
Your parents left all that behind,

11:14.291 --> 11:16.833
and yet they
are still Jewish enough for Hitler?

11:16.833 --> 11:18.000
Yes.

11:26.833 --> 11:27.750
Thank you.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.875
Thank you.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.000
My daughter is waiting in New York.

11:43.333 --> 11:47.333
She wanted me to leave Germany with her.
That was two years ago.

11:47.333 --> 11:48.791
Why didn't you leave?

11:51.250 --> 11:52.291
Stupidity.

11:54.833 --> 11:55.708
Pride.

11:56.416 --> 11:59.000
Do you have the documents
to be able to leave?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.583
No, not yet.

12:01.583 --> 12:05.958
But I have unwavering faith
and trust in God.

12:05.958 --> 12:06.875
And...

12:07.541 --> 12:08.458
<i>hatmadah.</i>

12:09.250 --> 12:10.500
<i>Hatmadah?</i>

12:10.500 --> 12:11.666
Perseverance.

12:12.791 --> 12:15.333
If Abraham can survive the ten tests,

12:15.333 --> 12:17.208
then we can survive this too.

12:21.916 --> 12:23.916
Hello.
- Speak of the devil.

12:23.916 --> 12:25.166
Oh, gee, thanks.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.791
Where's your dress?

12:30.791 --> 12:31.708
Oh.

12:31.708 --> 12:33.416
Seriously, what are you wearing?

12:33.416 --> 12:35.500
Down to the beach again?
- No.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.916
Our job's difficult enough.

12:38.916 --> 12:42.666
Just find the 200 people on the list
approved by the State Department,

12:42.666 --> 12:44.250
get them out on boats to the US.

12:44.250 --> 12:47.375
While the American government
is hoarding all of the visas

12:47.375 --> 12:50.208
and we have how many people
hiding out in this hotel?

12:50.208 --> 12:53.333
Poor Mr. Benjamin
is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

12:53.333 --> 12:54.541
I'm working on him.

12:54.541 --> 12:57.375
The Museum of Modern Art
is working on Ernst and Breton.

12:57.375 --> 13:00.000
You've been in Marseille
for how long now, Varian?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.708
What is it, two months?

13:01.708 --> 13:03.125
And in all that time,

13:03.125 --> 13:05.666
how many people
from the committee's famous list

13:05.666 --> 13:07.500
have you officially managed to rescue?

13:07.500 --> 13:10.333
Not enough.
- Eleven people.

13:10.333 --> 13:11.958
Eleven people! That's it.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.625
Do you think I don't know that?

13:14.750 --> 13:17.875
I haven't managed one tenth
of what I've set out to do.

13:19.208 --> 13:21.208
My wife's already demanding I come home.

13:21.208 --> 13:25.458
I'm sorry. It's just the port is...
It's overflowing with desperate people.

13:25.458 --> 13:28.291
You're not the only person who cares.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.625
But this isn't a mob operation.

13:31.833 --> 13:33.791
We have to concentrate our resources.

13:33.791 --> 13:35.083
You mean my money.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.666
Yes, your money.

13:36.666 --> 13:37.916
My time.

13:38.625 --> 13:39.666
Lena's time.

13:41.333 --> 13:44.541
Look, if we don't concentrate
on who we've set out to rescue,

13:44.541 --> 13:46.458
we're never gonna get anything done.

15:15.166 --> 15:16.583
You know how he looks?

15:23.375 --> 15:24.208
Lionel?

15:26.666 --> 15:27.500
Lionel!

15:35.833 --> 15:37.291
A woman sent us.

15:37.833 --> 15:38.916
Mary Jayne Gold.

15:40.916 --> 15:42.375
She only paid for two.

16:13.250 --> 16:14.375
Listen up!

16:15.000 --> 16:19.291
Take the dinghy and hurry over
to the stern side of the boat.

16:19.291 --> 16:21.916
Our men will tell you where to hide.
Understood?

16:21.916 --> 16:22.833
Okay.

16:22.833 --> 16:26.041
Documented passengers board
when the ship comes into port.

16:26.041 --> 16:28.958
You'll board now, before the cargo.

16:29.625 --> 16:32.958
Stay in the hold
till the anchor is raised. Okay?

16:44.208 --> 16:45.625
Isn't he coming?

17:56.500 --> 17:57.416
Shit.

17:58.250 --> 17:59.416
Oh no!

17:59.416 --> 18:00.625
No! No, no, no!

18:05.416 --> 18:06.375
No, no, no, no!

18:10.916 --> 18:12.083
Police.

18:12.083 --> 18:13.416
Don't stop.

18:19.583 --> 18:22.375
Ursula, we need to jump!
Take off your coat.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.375
You'll be too heavy.

18:27.208 --> 18:29.708
Can he swim?
- Quick!

18:30.708 --> 18:31.708
Ursula!

18:34.625 --> 18:35.750
Ursula!

18:37.291 --> 18:38.291
Albert!

18:42.875 --> 18:44.208
Can you see him?

18:44.208 --> 18:46.916
- No, I can't find him!
- I'll go back down. Stay here!

18:52.625 --> 18:53.583
Albert!

18:59.666 --> 19:00.541
Albert!

19:28.500 --> 19:30.583
Did you try to swim to America?

19:32.500 --> 19:34.583
Easier than getting an exit visa.

19:37.750 --> 19:39.375
At least I survived.

19:40.625 --> 19:42.166
An old man drowned trying.

19:43.083 --> 19:45.500
Exit stamps, entry papers,

19:46.375 --> 19:47.666
transit visas...

19:49.625 --> 19:52.041
The Nazis took inspiration from Kafka.

19:53.333 --> 19:54.541
Thank you.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.916
An American tried to help us, but...

20:02.250 --> 20:03.500
Americans?

20:04.083 --> 20:05.000
Forget it.

20:06.750 --> 20:08.333
We have to help ourselves.

20:12.875 --> 20:16.833
Mr. Benjamin, I assure you
that we are gonna get you out of here.

20:16.833 --> 20:19.250
There was no way to anticipate
what happened...

20:21.583 --> 20:22.625
What's going on?

20:24.875 --> 20:27.750
Police round-up on the MS Rex.
What?

20:27.750 --> 20:30.333
Caught dozens of refugees
trying to stow away.

20:30.333 --> 20:31.750
The boat's been impounded.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.416
Can you take the dog, please?

20:33.416 --> 20:35.291
- Sorry, I have to go.
- Mary Jayne.

20:38.750 --> 20:41.250
I'll die
in this godforsaken country.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.583
Is this enough?
- No.

21:12.625 --> 21:13.916
<i>Let's go, ladies.</i>

21:16.125 --> 21:18.583
What's going on?
- Just keep walking.

21:39.125 --> 21:40.750
How can we help ourselves?

21:42.333 --> 21:43.333
Tell me.

21:51.375 --> 21:52.750
You set us up?

21:52.750 --> 21:56.958
No. I swear to you, I didn't.
I thought it would work. I bailed you out.

21:56.958 --> 21:58.125
I'm so sorry.

21:58.750 --> 22:01.833
Uh, your brother should be here too.

22:02.708 --> 22:04.458
Did you see my brother?

22:05.166 --> 22:08.875
Did you see my brother?
He's... He's this tall, blue eyes.

22:08.875 --> 22:11.958
Oh yeah. I think they took him aside
as we were coming out.

22:11.958 --> 22:13.791
He's still inside?
- Yeah.

22:18.625 --> 22:21.958
My brother's still inside.
Please, you have to help us.

22:23.875 --> 22:26.375
I've found an unguarded path
over the mountains.

22:26.875 --> 22:29.750
Over the Pyrenees?
On foot? That's impossible.

22:29.750 --> 22:31.541
I'm leaving now. Come if you want.

22:31.541 --> 22:33.625
Please let me make it up to you.

22:34.416 --> 22:37.958
- She found a pass into Spain.
What?

22:37.958 --> 22:38.958
Who's that?

22:38.958 --> 22:41.625
You can trust me.
Please. I wanna help.

22:45.500 --> 22:48.125
The path starts
outside Banyuls-sur-Mer.

22:48.125 --> 22:49.458
Albert, I...

22:49.458 --> 22:52.291
I can't leave Albert.
- I'll wait for him.

22:52.291 --> 22:54.500
- You'd do that?
- Here... one second.

22:57.458 --> 22:59.291
Can we really trust her?

22:59.291 --> 23:02.041
Show me.
I'll make sure he finds you.

23:02.041 --> 23:03.458
We can't wait for him.

23:04.250 --> 23:07.333
Border guards start patrolling at sunrise.
They shoot to kill.

23:07.333 --> 23:10.541
Then I will make sure
that he is right behind you, I promise.

23:10.541 --> 23:14.541
Okay, just outside Banyuls-sur-Mer,
there is a stone house.

23:14.541 --> 23:17.791
You want to turn right. Okay?
And then you see the vineyards...

23:20.083 --> 23:21.958
Hirschman. Sir.

23:22.833 --> 23:23.791
Um...

23:23.791 --> 23:26.208
An old German name.

23:27.500 --> 23:28.916
Difficult.
- Hm.

23:29.541 --> 23:33.000
Maybe. It's spelled
differently in each of your passports.

23:34.875 --> 23:36.541
So, which is the real one?

23:36.541 --> 23:38.541
Or are they all fake?

23:40.583 --> 23:42.541
Uh, you fought at Hannut?

23:43.125 --> 23:44.500
- Hm?
Um...

23:44.500 --> 23:46.500
You fought at Hannut?

23:47.958 --> 23:49.750
Ah, yes.

23:50.500 --> 23:54.208
I still don't understand
how it all went south so quickly.

23:58.458 --> 23:59.583
I served...

24:01.625 --> 24:06.416
in the French immigrant infantry division,

24:07.458 --> 24:08.541
east of Paris.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.916
It's where
my French passport comes from.

24:14.583 --> 24:17.750
General Georges gave it to me himself.

24:18.833 --> 24:20.208
I used this one

24:22.125 --> 24:24.208
to fight for the republicans in Spain.

24:25.666 --> 24:29.458
This one here got me into Italy
to study economics

24:30.958 --> 24:32.750
until the fascists kicked me out.

24:33.666 --> 24:34.750
And this one...

24:37.000 --> 24:39.791
This one got me out of Germany in '33.

24:44.625 --> 24:45.625
Um...

24:47.291 --> 24:49.416
So which is your real identity?

24:50.958 --> 24:53.125
If you ask the Nazis? None.

24:53.125 --> 24:56.166
They don't think
that I deserve an identity.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.625
An American woman paid your bail.

25:05.666 --> 25:08.375
I kept you for falsifying documents, but...

25:10.833 --> 25:12.333
I see nothing false about you.

25:14.833 --> 25:16.083
<i>Sir, please...</i>

25:16.083 --> 25:18.666
You told me he'd be out two hours ago,

25:18.666 --> 25:21.333
and now I've been waiting here, and I...

25:27.083 --> 25:30.083
Excuse me, are you Albert Hirschman?

25:31.500 --> 25:33.666
- I'm Mary Jayne--
- I know. The American.

25:34.958 --> 25:36.500
- Where's my sister?
- Um...

25:37.250 --> 25:40.250
There's a lot
that I have to explain to you,

25:40.958 --> 25:43.708
but... we are so late.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.625
You're never gonna make it. Um...

25:46.625 --> 25:47.625
Wh--

25:48.416 --> 25:51.291
I... I could drive you there.
I'll drive you there.

25:51.291 --> 25:53.666
You don't have
somewhere else you need to be?

26:31.416 --> 26:32.375
How old are you?

26:32.916 --> 26:33.750
Twenty-five.

26:35.208 --> 26:36.166
How old are you?

26:37.166 --> 26:38.916
That's a very rude question.

26:43.291 --> 26:44.416
And what do you do?

26:44.958 --> 26:45.791
Do?

26:45.791 --> 26:46.916
Professionally.

26:48.375 --> 26:50.416
- I trained as an economist.
- Oh.

26:50.416 --> 26:53.458
But, uh, well, I've been running
from the Nazis for so long,

26:53.458 --> 26:57.041
at this point,
I guess... I'm a professional refugee.

26:58.458 --> 26:59.500
And a Jew.

27:01.208 --> 27:04.875
Yeah. You know, being Jewish
never really meant anything to me.

27:05.916 --> 27:08.041
Now it's the most important thing
about me.

27:11.000 --> 27:11.958
What do you do?

27:12.583 --> 27:14.708
I... do what I can.

27:14.708 --> 27:16.208
I have a car.

27:16.208 --> 27:19.000
- A Mercedes, no less.

27:21.041 --> 27:24.958
People think there's nothing
they can do to help, so they do nothing.

27:25.625 --> 27:29.291
Most people don't expect rich, beautiful
American girls to do anything.

27:32.375 --> 27:37.833
I'm missing my plane to Chicago tonight
to drive you to the border of Spain.

27:37.833 --> 27:39.083
What's in Chicago?

27:40.791 --> 27:41.791
Nothing.

27:48.458 --> 27:52.500
People's assumptions about you
can be useful if you know how to use them.

28:41.000 --> 28:41.958
Oh God.

28:43.916 --> 28:47.291
Just play the American girl.
- Yeah, what are you gonna do?

29:05.375 --> 29:09.250
Hello. Papers, please.
- Oh. Yes, sir.

29:15.458 --> 29:17.333
Excuse me, sir. Um...

29:18.125 --> 29:19.708
We're in a hurry.

29:20.666 --> 29:23.791
Hurry... Hurry?
- Ah. Why are you in a hurry?

29:25.541 --> 29:27.250
We just had oysters.

29:29.291 --> 29:31.000
Ah, oysters.

29:36.833 --> 29:39.125
- Uh...

29:39.125 --> 29:40.375
All good.

29:41.083 --> 29:42.708
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:42.708 --> 29:43.708
Let them pass!

30:10.416 --> 30:12.583
Paul. Any news?

30:12.583 --> 30:13.666
Nothing yet.

30:15.833 --> 30:18.583
Your wife must have a lot to say.
Never misses a day.

30:20.750 --> 30:22.041
You married, Paul?

30:22.041 --> 30:25.791
Not yet, sir. Just me and Petit.
And our mother back home in Ouidah.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.708
- Where is that?
- West Africa, Mr. Fry.

30:29.625 --> 30:32.875
Some say French Dahomey.
But it used to be the Kingdom of Dahomey.

30:33.416 --> 30:34.500
She want you home?

30:34.500 --> 30:38.458
- She's just glad we are out of the army.
- I am saving all my money to go home.

30:38.458 --> 30:40.125
He wants to go back.

30:40.125 --> 30:42.916
But I want to finish my studies.
I have big plans.

30:44.500 --> 30:46.875
Where's this from?
There's no postage on this.

30:47.833 --> 30:51.750
A man hand-delivered it this morning.
He said he was an old friend.

30:59.875 --> 31:02.041
Uh, do you have a map of the local area?

31:02.041 --> 31:03.583
Yes. Yes, of course.

31:07.708 --> 31:08.541
Here.

31:10.125 --> 31:11.083
Thanks.

31:38.541 --> 31:42.041
So, I think they can't be that far away

31:42.041 --> 31:45.083
because you've already
cut the distance in half. You see?

31:45.083 --> 31:46.125
Mm-hmm.

31:55.208 --> 31:58.916
Whoever's waiting for you in Chicago
will be very disappointed tomorrow.

32:03.791 --> 32:04.791
Thank you.

33:18.583 --> 33:19.583
Thomas.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.208
Welcome to the Villa Air-Bel.

33:24.625 --> 33:25.958
Whose house is this?

33:25.958 --> 33:28.791
It belongs to a distant relative.

33:29.666 --> 33:31.416
And you're living here?

33:31.416 --> 33:32.791
I just got here.

33:33.666 --> 33:36.375
I'm still trying to get
the electricity turned on.

33:55.166 --> 33:57.416
I sent a letter
to your home in New Jersey.

33:59.166 --> 34:00.458
Your wife wrote back.

34:01.166 --> 34:04.416
Told me you're saving
the European brain trust from the Nazis.

34:08.041 --> 34:09.041
How's that going?

34:12.083 --> 34:14.083
It's going very well. Thank you.

34:17.833 --> 34:19.541
You're still a terrible liar.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.125
I have to get back to work.
- Right now?

34:28.416 --> 34:33.000
I'm doing something truly important here,
maybe for the first time in my life.

34:33.625 --> 34:36.125
I could help you.
- And then what?

34:36.125 --> 34:38.041
Disappear again for five years?

34:39.041 --> 34:41.291
I thought you'd been captured, Thomas.

34:42.958 --> 34:43.958
Or worse.

34:57.125 --> 34:58.208
Thomas.

35:30.333 --> 35:32.083
I can't let you distract me.

35:34.250 --> 35:35.291
Never.

36:30.333 --> 36:32.833
Just a few steps to the Spanish border.

36:33.833 --> 36:35.375
- Is that good?
- Yeah.

37:02.791 --> 37:04.583
Say goodbye to France.

37:06.791 --> 37:07.875
Stop!

37:07.875 --> 37:08.791
Run!

37:08.791 --> 37:10.458
Stop immediately!

37:13.083 --> 37:14.833
Papers, please, everyone!

37:15.458 --> 37:17.791
The village ahead is Spanish territory!

37:17.791 --> 37:20.875
You cannot approach the border
without a French exit stamp.

37:20.875 --> 37:23.541
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

37:24.333 --> 37:26.333
Why did you abandon your posts?

37:26.333 --> 37:28.875
Huh? Unmanned tracts of the Spanish border

37:28.875 --> 37:31.625
are under direct control
of the Geheime Staatspolizei.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.500
What's that?
- Gestapo.

37:34.500 --> 37:37.916
Your presence is
a violation of the Compiègne Armistice

37:37.916 --> 37:39.750
between our two governments.

37:39.750 --> 37:43.250
This is the new France, officers.

37:43.250 --> 37:46.666
Performing duties
beyond the limits of your jurisdiction

37:46.666 --> 37:49.333
is punishable by law.
Do you understand that?

37:49.333 --> 37:51.791
Yes.
Keep it straight.

37:51.791 --> 37:53.916
Now run along back to your desks.

37:53.916 --> 37:55.833
Go! Now! Run!

38:00.083 --> 38:00.958
Oh.

38:06.583 --> 38:07.416
Hey.

38:13.791 --> 38:14.708
Thank you.

38:18.833 --> 38:21.583
From Barcelona,
we take the bus to Lisbon?

38:21.583 --> 38:22.666
Exactly.

38:31.500 --> 38:32.416
Come.

38:34.041 --> 38:35.625
- I can't do it.
What?

38:36.208 --> 38:37.250
I'm going back.

38:37.250 --> 38:38.875
- No.
I'm going.

38:42.041 --> 38:43.041
Not you too?

38:46.833 --> 38:48.541
- Listen to me.
- I knew it.

38:49.166 --> 38:53.625
There are so many people now
in Marseille just waiting to get out.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.125
We know how to get them out.

38:55.125 --> 38:58.458
We observe Shabbat once
with that old man and now you're Moses?

38:58.458 --> 38:59.541
Ursula...

38:59.541 --> 39:02.333
You'll both end up in a camp.
Or dead.

39:02.333 --> 39:03.500
- Ursula...

39:05.333 --> 39:07.250
You promised you'd stay with me.

39:07.250 --> 39:09.791
<i>Señores, nos vamos.</i>

39:18.208 --> 39:19.125
Ursula.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.666
Please understand.

39:23.208 --> 39:25.875
I'll catch up with you in Lisbon.
Do you hear?

39:26.541 --> 39:29.916
Send word of your whereabouts
to the Splendide. Did you hear me?

39:29.916 --> 39:32.458
Send word of where you are
to the Splendide!

39:45.125 --> 39:47.958
<i>In Marseille,
authorities declared</i>

39:47.958 --> 39:51.791
<i>that due to gross mismanagement,
creating an illegal immigration crisis,</i>

39:51.791 --> 39:56.791
<i>a series of arrests,
and an unmanageable crisis for the police,</i>

39:56.791 --> 40:03.541
<i>no passenger ships bound for points west
will dock in Marseille or in France...</i>

40:03.541 --> 40:04.458
Damn it.

40:04.458 --> 40:05.791
<i>...until further notice.</i>

40:07.208 --> 40:11.250
<i>In fact, all French ports will remain
closed to all passenger ships</i>

40:11.750 --> 40:12.916
<i>until the threat of...</i>

40:12.916 --> 40:16.125
Wait. Can they do that?
- They just did it.

40:16.125 --> 40:18.333
<i>Vichy has instructed the police</i>

40:18.333 --> 40:22.708
<i>to begin enforcement of Article 19
of the Franco-German armistice.</i>

40:25.125 --> 40:26.625
What's Article 19?

40:26.625 --> 40:30.291
All refugees on French soil
must be surrendered on demand.

40:30.291 --> 40:32.666
- To whom?
- The German Reich.

40:33.458 --> 40:35.666
You said they weren't gonna crack down.

40:36.583 --> 40:37.625
I was wrong.

40:37.625 --> 40:40.416
Wait. They can't actually deport people,
can they?

40:40.416 --> 40:43.833
- They can make it impossible to get out--
- It's already impossible.

40:43.833 --> 40:45.916
But send them back? Now?

40:45.916 --> 40:47.500
Come in!

40:49.083 --> 40:49.916
Can I help you?

40:51.375 --> 40:54.750
I'm looking for Miss Gold.
What are you doing here?

40:56.666 --> 40:58.416
This is Lisa Fittko.

40:58.416 --> 41:01.500
- She found a safe route into Spain.
It worked?

41:01.500 --> 41:03.416
We went over last night

41:03.416 --> 41:06.916
with five people who are now
on their way to safety in Lisbon.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Commissaire Frot!

41:25.375 --> 41:26.916
So glad you could join me.

41:33.416 --> 41:39.208
I just want to be absolutely sure
that you understand the Article 19.

41:39.208 --> 41:42.000
Yes, I read your cable.

41:42.000 --> 41:47.041
Uh, all undesirables are to be surrendered
upon demand to the local police.

41:47.041 --> 41:48.083
Rosé?

41:49.375 --> 41:53.458
Marseille is crawling with refugees
from all over Europe.

41:53.458 --> 41:58.333
Um, I am the chief of police,
so it is my job to clean up the city.

41:59.416 --> 42:02.416
You are the American consul,
Mr. Patterson.

42:02.416 --> 42:07.666
So it is your job to make sure that
no American people make trouble for me.

42:08.875 --> 42:09.750
Of course.

42:11.000 --> 42:16.708
Then what about
the American Emergency Rescue Committee?

42:17.708 --> 42:19.000
Hm.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.750
Despite my instructions,
you issued the visa they requested

42:22.750 --> 42:25.125
for German writer Walter Benjamin.

42:26.041 --> 42:28.125
You said dangerous writers.

42:28.125 --> 42:30.958
You never mentioned
Walter Benjamin explicitly.

42:31.500 --> 42:34.583
He writes about nonsense.
How could he be dangerous?

42:34.583 --> 42:36.416
He's on the Nazi blacklist.

42:37.166 --> 42:41.666
So if this man leaves Marseille
on my watch,

42:42.708 --> 42:44.583
I will hold you accountable.

42:48.375 --> 42:50.500
Well, lucky for both of us,

42:50.500 --> 42:52.583
his boat got impounded a few days ago,

42:52.583 --> 42:55.458
so he's probably
still shacked up at the Splendide.

42:56.208 --> 42:58.166
Benjamin is at the Hotel Splendide?

42:58.166 --> 43:02.500
Last I heard, they all were.
Benjamin, Ernst, Breton.

43:08.458 --> 43:11.083
If we cross the border
before the guards show up at daybreak,

43:11.083 --> 43:15.291
I could take...
four people at a time, twice a week.

43:15.291 --> 43:17.291
That's over 100 by Christmas.

43:17.291 --> 43:19.500
And you don't need French exit stamps?

43:19.500 --> 43:22.250
If they do, we'll just buy forgeries.
That's easy.

43:22.250 --> 43:24.291
I need to keep this squeaky clean.

43:24.291 --> 43:27.875
Varian, this is our chance.
Think about the number of people we can--

43:27.875 --> 43:30.958
What if the French police
come after me and shut this down?

43:30.958 --> 43:33.125
You don't have to know about it.

43:34.541 --> 43:37.000
I'll deal with the black market.
You remain clean.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.208
Forgeries can't be cheap.
- No.

43:39.208 --> 43:40.708
I'll take care of it.

43:40.708 --> 43:43.208
- We're also talking about train tickets.
Mm-hmm.

43:43.208 --> 43:45.083
- Hotels. Meals.
I have the money.

43:45.083 --> 43:46.000
No problem.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.208
- Okay.
Okay!

43:54.208 --> 43:57.833
Okay!
All right, well, that is settled, then.

43:57.833 --> 44:00.875
Varian, you remain
the face of the operation.

44:00.875 --> 44:03.791
Lisa, you are the muscle.

44:03.791 --> 44:06.875
- Albert's definitely the criminal.
- Oh no!

44:06.875 --> 44:08.583
Okay, then what are you?

44:09.375 --> 44:10.750
Oh, I'm just the bank.

44:12.875 --> 44:14.500
Give yourself more credit.

44:14.500 --> 44:16.375
Come in.

44:20.166 --> 44:21.125
And who are you?

44:21.125 --> 44:22.958
Paul. Kandjo.

44:22.958 --> 44:26.458
- Oh, he's the brains.
Uh, telegram for Mary Jayne.

44:28.041 --> 44:29.583
We need a budget.

44:29.583 --> 44:31.125
How much per person?

44:31.833 --> 44:34.041
I'm sure people will be happy
to share rooms.

44:35.250 --> 44:36.500
How easy is the hike?

44:44.000 --> 44:45.750
Right, Mary Jayne?

44:47.666 --> 44:49.250
Mary Jayne, everything okay?

44:50.166 --> 44:51.166
Yes.

44:52.291 --> 44:53.666
Let's get back to work.
