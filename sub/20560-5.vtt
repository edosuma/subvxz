00:21.563 --> 00:23.481
[theme music playing]

02:22.433 --> 02:23.726
Is it true?

02:28.940 --> 02:29.858
Jonas is dead.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.698
What do we do now?

02:46.791 --> 02:49.919
-Yes?
-My name is Koman Nyagah.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.589
I'm head of the Kenyan
Democratic Reform Party.

02:52.672 --> 02:53.756
May we have a word?

02:53.840 --> 02:56.968
-We are tired.
-We're tired of bosses, thieves and thugs.

02:57.051 --> 02:59.929
-We're tired of corruption.
-It's endemic, systemic.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.806
We can no longer ignore the injustice.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.516
-We want to end it.
-We need your help.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.977
-We want to fight.
-Just as Van Damn would.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.187
We want you to run for office.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.776
[chuckles]

03:13.860 --> 03:15.820
Did Jela put you up to this?

03:16.279 --> 03:18.615
No, my friend. This is not a prank.

03:19.115 --> 03:22.410
-We're dead serious.
-We saw you on Kobi Kihara.

03:22.493 --> 03:24.829
-You were amazing.
-We believe that with your help,

03:24.913 --> 03:26.998
we can effect some
real meaningful change here.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.920
And what do you know about here?

03:33.254 --> 03:34.631
Are you from Kibera?

03:41.596 --> 03:42.931
I thought not.

03:44.974 --> 03:47.685
I think you should leave
before my mother returns.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.569
I'm not from here.

03:57.237 --> 04:01.241
But I don't need to be
to see the unfairness, the injustice.

04:01.324 --> 04:04.285
Please, just give our proposal
some thought.

04:05.161 --> 04:06.287
I'm not a politician.

04:06.371 --> 04:10.541
We're not looking for a politician.
We're looking for a leader.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.132
Welcome home.

05:50.641 --> 05:53.686
[Sanyam] And you can probably taste
a few new spices.

05:53.770 --> 05:57.523
Trying it out to see if customers like it.

05:58.357 --> 05:59.817
Try. Try this one.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.326
[Kala] Hmm...

06:10.161 --> 06:11.412
Tastes good.

06:11.496 --> 06:15.666
I've added a little bit of saffron
and, uh, some...

06:16.334 --> 06:19.378
black spiders. Some shoe leather.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.922
So good.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.758
And a pinch of horse shit.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.427
-My favorite.
-Your favorite?

06:26.511 --> 06:27.887
Hmm? [chuckles]

06:27.970 --> 06:29.472
You can taste it?

06:31.557 --> 06:34.560
[Kala laughs]

06:34.644 --> 06:35.937
Sorry.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.233
You want to talk about it?

06:40.316 --> 06:42.819
I would,
but there's nothing to talk about.

06:42.902 --> 06:47.490
Everything's perfect. My...
My house, my job, my husband...

06:48.324 --> 06:50.451
-Your bodyguard.
-[laughs]

06:51.369 --> 06:54.455
A very small price to pay
for all of this good fortune.

07:01.504 --> 07:04.006
-A-ha!
-What?

07:04.090 --> 07:07.468
Here's a connection.
The manufacturer of Angelica's equipment.

07:08.177 --> 07:09.262
How did you get that?

07:09.345 --> 07:11.639
The photos Lito sent from Raoul's room.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.307
God, you're smart.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.728
Abrasax Electronics, still in business,

07:17.812 --> 07:22.733
and still supplying technology
to guess-what-school's R and D lab?

07:23.609 --> 07:25.319
University of Chicago.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.322
Which could mean the research Angelica
was doing at the cabin

07:28.406 --> 07:30.324
she took with her to Whispers and Kolovi.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.744
-But why would she help them?
-Angels!

07:34.787 --> 07:37.039
I bring glad tidings.

07:37.748 --> 07:41.961
I have the solution... to your problem.

07:42.044 --> 07:43.838
Oh, which one?

07:43.921 --> 07:47.467
The one that brought you to Chateau Bug
in the middle of the night.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.260
Bendix.

07:49.343 --> 07:52.180
Ugh! The cops are never gonna
leave us alone.

07:52.263 --> 07:56.225
True. As long as you're alive, yes.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.479
But they'd stop pretty quick
if you were dead, wouldn't they?

08:02.773 --> 08:07.487
-What are you talking about, Bug?
-I'm talking E-Death.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.616
But E-Death is just a rumor.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.326
It's real.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.286
Though I use that word cautiously

08:15.369 --> 08:19.499
in this post-Homo sensorium relativity
of realities.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.375
What's E-Death?

08:21.459 --> 08:24.337
Supposedly something cooked up
by the NSA and CIA--

08:24.420 --> 08:27.131
It's a redaction protocol.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.884
They use it when someone's been
renditioned or black-sited

08:29.967 --> 08:32.053
and they want zero accountability.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.889
-Bug--
-I've seen it, buddy.

08:35.264 --> 08:37.266
They erase warrants, records,

08:37.350 --> 08:40.144
anything that might make one agency
trip over another one.

08:40.228 --> 08:44.273
They just go poof. And so do you.

08:44.857 --> 08:48.653
If you can do this, why haven't you?

08:48.736 --> 08:54.659
I didn't say I could do it, but I just
reached out to the guy that can.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.661
What guy?

08:56.744 --> 09:00.831
Not just any guy. The guy.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.459
Okay, can we stop with the whole
pregnant pause-y thing?

09:03.543 --> 09:06.879
Right. Sorry. Right. Okay.

09:06.963 --> 09:07.922
I'll set it.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.134
Up.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.556
Sometimes all my good fortune
makes we wonder

09:16.639 --> 09:18.558
whether I'm actually
appreciating it enough.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.310
And if I'm honest, I have to admit that,
no, I'm not sure I am.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.147
Which then makes me think that there
must be some flaw in my personality

09:25.231 --> 09:28.234
or my brain chemistry, which means
I just have to get used to the fact

09:28.317 --> 09:30.570
that no matter what happens,
I'm never going to be a person

09:30.653 --> 09:33.573
who can ever just... feel happy.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.533
No, that's not true.

09:36.158 --> 09:40.246
Few children in the world ever smiled
as easily as my daughter did.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.458
What happened to that girl?

09:46.210 --> 09:49.672
Do you remember the doll
you wanted so badly on your birthday?

09:49.755 --> 09:52.174
Uh, it had red hair.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.301
Anna.

09:54.510 --> 09:57.305
God, how you prayed and prayed
for that doll.

09:57.388 --> 10:00.141
On your birthday,
the whole family had come over.

10:00.224 --> 10:05.396
There was this huge pile of presents
on the table, but none of that mattered.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.983
It was like you had this x-ray vision.

10:09.066 --> 10:12.862
You went straight to it,
ripped it open and that was it.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.655
Party over.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.616
I loved that doll.

10:17.908 --> 10:22.705
As adults, we learn to carefully open
all the rest of the presents.

10:23.456 --> 10:28.961
We are taught to smile and to pretend
that all are equally important to us.

10:30.421 --> 10:34.717
But our heart... always knows the truth.

10:40.139 --> 10:44.352
But what if the truth is something
that can cause people to feel unhappy

10:44.435 --> 10:48.564
or-- or disappointed or... hurt?

10:51.651 --> 10:55.071
There are times I wish I could go back
to being that little girl.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.906
My life was much easier then.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.661
But I'm a woman now,

11:01.744 --> 11:06.707
and part of being a woman is understanding
that hearts are complicated things.

11:08.626 --> 11:09.835
They are.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.088
They are indeed.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.805
[dog whimpers]

11:29.480 --> 11:32.233
[chuckles, laughs]

11:36.320 --> 11:37.530
[kisses]

11:43.202 --> 11:45.538
[upbeat music plays]

11:50.459 --> 11:52.753
What you need is a good meal.

11:53.754 --> 11:54.880
Come.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.158
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll now be making a short stop.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.410
Buy some peanuts, stretch your legs,
admire the view,

12:24.493 --> 12:27.746
drink in this wonderful morning.
We'll be leaving in 15 minutes.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.253
[music continues]

12:41.218 --> 12:42.470
Good?

12:43.888 --> 12:46.557
-[belches]
-[laughs]

12:46.640 --> 12:47.766
I guess so.

13:12.958 --> 13:16.504
Hello. I would like to go to NTV.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.589
[laughs]

13:23.594 --> 13:24.678
Turn it up.

13:26.013 --> 13:30.142
Your sister has murdered
three more people. Do you care to comment?

13:30.976 --> 13:37.399
It's just, uh... I just wish people
could know my sister the way I know her.

13:37.942 --> 13:42.947
It's very hard to connect
these terrible crimes

13:43.030 --> 13:45.533
with the person I thought of
as my big sister.

13:46.408 --> 13:49.620
If your big sister is listening,
what would you like to say to her?

13:53.874 --> 13:58.963
Big sister... please, do the right thing.

14:00.881 --> 14:04.718
Please turn yourself in
before anyone else gets hurt.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.559
Sorry.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.520
If you didn't, I would have.

14:15.145 --> 14:18.899
Come, let's get you back where you belong.

14:31.787 --> 14:35.374
I would like to speak with a journalist,
Miss Zakia Asalache. Please.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.418
You're Van Damn, isn't it?

14:38.210 --> 14:39.920
Your interview was amazing.

14:40.546 --> 14:44.133
Hey. The one and only
Kung Fu King of Kibera.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.427
[man] Vanquisher of crime lords.

14:46.510 --> 14:50.306
-Provider of water to the thirsty masses.
-And Internet viral sensation.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.641
Though, I'll be honest,
that speech of yours

14:52.725 --> 14:55.352
sounded suspiciously like Zakia herself.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.731
Yeah, come on, Van Damn.
Your secret is safe with us.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.274
Zakia invented you, didn't she?

15:00.983 --> 15:02.109
Invented me?

15:02.192 --> 15:03.777
She may have come up with the story,

15:03.861 --> 15:05.779
but there's no way
she came up with that jacket.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.532
-That's definitely authentic.
-You mean antique.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.035
Yeah, I'm guessing early Bronze Age.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.954
Last worn during the reign of Seyyid Said.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.956
[man laughs]

15:16.040 --> 15:19.001
I don't know you and I'm sorry
if you have a problem with me.

15:19.084 --> 15:22.713
It's not us who have the problem,
if you're interested in Zakia Asalache.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.506
-Yeah.
-Why?

15:25.299 --> 15:26.550
Do we tell him the truth?

15:28.385 --> 15:30.512
[man laughs]

15:33.515 --> 15:38.687
A bit of a sordid tale here,
but when Zakia was studying in London,

15:38.771 --> 15:42.316
a story broke out that she preferred
lunchboxes to baguettes.

15:44.902 --> 15:45.945
I'm sorry...

15:46.028 --> 15:49.448
She'd rather slurp on a mango
than chomp on a banana.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.742
You know, she prefers pussies to puppies.

15:51.825 --> 15:56.080
-Dude, she likes girls.
-It was a huge scandal for the family.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.207
You know, her father's a serious
muckety-muck.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.416
All we're saying is--

15:59.500 --> 16:04.088
If you've got a dick in those pants,
you've got no chance, bro. [chuckles]

16:08.717 --> 16:12.054
Yes. Okay. Okay.

16:13.889 --> 16:18.727
Miss Zakia is in meetings all day
and cannot be disturbed. I'm sorry.

16:19.728 --> 16:21.814
-[whispers] Stop.
-Could you let her know that...

16:23.023 --> 16:26.318
No, never mind. Thank you.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.042
Oh!

16:42.584 --> 16:43.669
Are you okay?

16:44.253 --> 16:46.005
Prison was good for you.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.216
Tell me you have a war plan.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.262
I have no plan. I have an enemy.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.765
And I won't stop until he's dead.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.352
Or I am.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.610
Good plan.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.034
[Whispers] Good morning, Will.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.538
I love watching a woman wake.

17:19.621 --> 17:24.001
A glimpse of her innocence
before she begins assembling herself.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.252
Riley.

17:26.628 --> 17:27.463
Is he here?

17:27.546 --> 17:30.924
True beauty is in that moment
of vulnerability.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.677
-I have the blockers.
-Yeah.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.512
You won't need them.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.766
This isn't a trick, Will.
That game's over for me.

17:38.849 --> 17:39.850
Thanks to you,

17:39.933 --> 17:43.187
I have the most secure position
I've ever had in the organization.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.189
[Will] Then what do you want?

17:46.523 --> 17:49.610
I was hoping we could be honest
with each other.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.949
I guess it's safe to say you're in London.

17:59.036 --> 18:02.998
When I did my PhD in medicine,
I came here for the first time.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.501
I'm in awe of this building.

18:07.377 --> 18:10.547
As much a work of art as it is a fortress.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.760
Soaring, beautiful vertical lines.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.180
The style is called Perpendicular Gothic,

18:18.263 --> 18:23.727
widely used after the Black Plague
destroyed much of Europe.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.855
Is this gonna be on the test?

18:28.982 --> 18:34.029
The Black Plague revealed our
vulnerabilities and it terrified people.

18:34.113 --> 18:39.159
So what did they do? They built temples
to the immortal like this.

18:39.243 --> 18:42.287
Vertical lines descend from heaven,

18:42.371 --> 18:46.083
with all the might of the Lord
bearing down on a single point

18:46.166 --> 18:50.087
until it is utterly
and irrevocably crushed.

18:51.421 --> 18:55.175
Let me guess... I'm that single point.

18:56.718 --> 18:57.761
No.

18:59.638 --> 19:00.848
I am.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.854
I don't expect you to understand me
or my work.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.273
Another misunderstood psychopath.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.652
I am trying to engineer a future
with a species that is more violent,

19:13.735 --> 19:17.948
intolerant and possessive than
any species in the history of this planet.

19:18.031 --> 19:21.076
Sapiens live in a world
designed by their worst fears.

19:22.327 --> 19:25.372
And nothing terrifies them
like difference.

19:25.455 --> 19:29.293
You save your fucking justifications.
You murdered an innocent girl.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.838
I know you killed Sara Patrell.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.674
Who?

19:37.050 --> 19:41.388
There will always be unfortunate
necessities during the construction

19:41.471 --> 19:42.931
of a monument such as this.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.184
I thought a cop would understand that.

19:45.851 --> 19:46.810
Angelica did.

19:46.894 --> 19:50.814
She saw our work as the key to the future
for both our species.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.774
[Whispers] This building is a symbol.

19:53.317 --> 19:57.738
Its powerful vertical lines
are the assurance of authority.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.867
She believed in what we were doing
as much as I did.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.330
Then why did she put a gun in her mouth
and blow her brains out?

20:07.331 --> 20:09.333
Why do soldiers kill themselves?

20:10.459 --> 20:11.752
Or cops?

20:14.630 --> 20:19.760
People who bear the full weight
of the truth sometimes break, Will.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.474
Angelica broke.

20:27.100 --> 20:30.437
Just like one day you or I might break.

20:32.064 --> 20:35.525
But then you know all about breaking,
don't you?

20:36.401 --> 20:41.031
You watched it happen to your father,
day after day...

20:42.366 --> 20:45.786
though he chose booze instead of a bullet.

20:48.205 --> 20:50.624
Let me show you what I know
about breaking.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.292
[grunts]

20:53.085 --> 20:54.419
Will.

20:56.338 --> 20:57.589
Are you okay?

21:10.477 --> 21:12.896
These extremists won't be happy

21:12.980 --> 21:16.233
until they've dragged the entire world
back to Dark Ages.

21:16.316 --> 21:19.987
I'm not sure that's what they're after,
but I do take your point.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.906
Maybe we should just discuss
a more pleasant subject.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.116
-Good point.
-Mm.

21:24.199 --> 21:26.576
-This Banjari Gosht is incredible.
-Yes, it's wonderful.

21:26.660 --> 21:30.455
-The balance between spice and masala...
-Sanyam, you've totally outdone yourself.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.082
-Thank you.
-If you don't mind...

21:32.165 --> 21:36.003
Sanyam, do you understand
the kind of the future world

21:36.086 --> 21:38.839
these terrorists hope to build
with their bombs?

21:38.922 --> 21:41.258
It's not for me to speak for them.

21:41.341 --> 21:44.428
Well, somebody should.
Somebody should because they themselves

21:44.511 --> 21:47.639
obviously can't speak any other language
besides violence.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.726
Maybe that was the language
that was taught to them.

21:50.809 --> 21:51.852
Oh...

21:51.935 --> 21:55.147
Don't tell me you're one of those liberals
who really believes

21:55.230 --> 21:57.733
these psychopaths who murder
innocent civilians,

21:57.816 --> 21:59.651
-they themselves are the victims.
-No, no, no.

21:59.735 --> 22:03.030
I'm one of those silly people who believe
that if you kill someone,

22:03.113 --> 22:08.577
you should be tried for it, whether you're
a psychopath, a policeman or a president.

22:09.578 --> 22:10.954
You're worse than a liberal.

22:11.038 --> 22:15.167
Oh, Daya, may I have some of the Dal?
Dad, the Dal... phenomenal.

22:15.250 --> 22:18.837
One second, one second. Hold on, hold on.
Let me ask you something, Manendra.

22:18.920 --> 22:22.632
As a government insider, tell me, since
the British left, the structure of power,

22:22.716 --> 22:25.802
the distribution of wealth,
these things remain almost identical.

22:25.886 --> 22:29.598
And sometimes, I ask myself... why?

22:30.223 --> 22:33.977
Maybe a man as smart as you can finally
answer this question for me.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.645
You know, I think I'll have
a bit more Dal myself.

22:35.729 --> 22:38.440
-Yes, yes. It's very good, right?
-[overlapping chatter]

22:38.523 --> 22:40.817
-Really, I'm having so much of the Dal.
-Mm. Try some, Father?

22:40.901 --> 22:43.487
In my humble opinion, Sanyam,

22:43.570 --> 22:47.908
societies remain unchanged
because the human beings remain unchanged.

22:48.575 --> 22:54.414
Not everyone is born to be a great leader,
just as not everybody's born to be a cook.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.168
Okay, I see.

22:58.668 --> 23:03.507
Well, spending a lifetime in the kitchen
learning how to cook was my destiny,

23:03.590 --> 23:06.301
just as inheriting a fortune was yours.

23:07.052 --> 23:09.638
[Rajan] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Look at the time!

23:09.721 --> 23:12.849
The conversation has been so stimulating
that the evening has just flown by.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.143
-Yeah. You have a meeting.
-I have a meeting, yes.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.770
I don't know about the rest of you,
but Kala and I

23:16.853 --> 23:19.397
are really beginning
to love these family dinners.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.691
-[Kala] Best part of the week.
-[laughter]

23:21.775 --> 23:23.693
-[Rajan] Sadly, we have to head home now.
-[Kala] Yeah.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.153
-[woman] Bye.
-Good evening. Bye, Mum.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.488
[woman] Bye.

23:31.368 --> 23:34.538
Mm? This one... This one's not bad.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.498
-How many pages?
-Nine.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.458
But it's good. It's the hero's brother.

23:38.542 --> 23:42.254
-Let me guess, the sensitive brother.
-Lifelong bachelor.

23:42.337 --> 23:45.048
-But at least he doesn't die from AIDS.
-So he does die.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.467
Drug overdose.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.220
I don't know.
It's still a notch up from...

23:50.303 --> 23:53.682
"serial killer who talks with a soft lisp
and wears mascara."

23:55.267 --> 23:58.520
You think that's bad? Listen to this.

23:58.603 --> 24:02.149
"The Hispanic coke dealer is about
to give another kind of blow job

24:02.232 --> 24:04.860
when he finally gets the bullet
he deserves."

24:06.361 --> 24:09.239
I told you. I told you. This is it.

24:09.322 --> 24:10.490
This is how careers end.

24:10.574 --> 24:13.326
You either take the roles you hate
or you sit at home

24:13.410 --> 24:16.246
-until you're completely forgotten.
-Lito, you're not gonna be forgotten.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.373
Your films are so good
and you have so many fans.

24:18.456 --> 24:20.917
Had. I had fans, Dani.

24:21.001 --> 24:24.462
-Look at my Twitter feed.
-Hey, you promised no social media.

24:24.546 --> 24:27.424
But it's evidence.
It's evidence, Hernando.

24:27.507 --> 24:29.384
It proves no one wants anything
to do with me.

24:30.051 --> 24:33.972
Well, that is not true.
Somebody wants you and here's the proof.

24:34.055 --> 24:37.475
An all-expenses-paid trip to São Paulo.

24:37.559 --> 24:40.645
[squeals] São Paulo? I've never been.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.522
-Is it an offer?
-Yes.

24:42.606 --> 24:44.774
Is it a... Is it a movie offer?

24:44.858 --> 24:47.444
As the grand master
of the São Paulo Gay Pride parade.

24:47.527 --> 24:50.238
-Oh, my God! That's amazing!
-Come on, guys.

24:50.947 --> 24:54.659
What? What? Last year they had
over five million people.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.287
-Are you serious?
-It sounds so fun.

24:57.370 --> 24:58.872
Come on, Lito. You have to go.

24:58.955 --> 25:00.957
Maybe this is just what you need.

25:01.041 --> 25:05.503
To remember how many people
are affected by what you did.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.464
[Lito] Yeah, great idea.

25:07.547 --> 25:10.258
Then El Tempo can publish pictures of me
with five million people

25:10.342 --> 25:13.386
in thongs, leather and feathers.
[laughs]

25:13.470 --> 25:16.223
I can't wait for the scripts we get
after that.

25:18.892 --> 25:22.103
Family, please,
try to understand what is happening here.

25:23.021 --> 25:24.731
I've been typecast.

25:25.732 --> 25:27.067
This is prison for an actor.

25:28.777 --> 25:33.615
I'm trapped here not because
of what I did, but because of who I am.

25:34.866 --> 25:37.118
This is painful enough to think about.

25:38.245 --> 25:39.371
But worse...

25:41.248 --> 25:45.252
is facing the idea that...
there may be no way out of it.

26:19.536 --> 26:21.538
What the fuck?

26:21.621 --> 26:22.622
What?

26:24.457 --> 26:25.709
It's Lito.

26:25.792 --> 26:27.961
[indistinct dialogue in movie]

26:30.130 --> 26:32.132
What the fuck?

26:32.215 --> 26:34.342
You know Lito Rodriguez?

26:35.677 --> 26:37.178
He's in my cluster.

26:38.346 --> 26:42.809
Lito Rodriguez...
is one of the voices in your head?

26:42.892 --> 26:46.146
-Shh! Bug!
-Right. Sorry. Shh!

26:48.815 --> 26:50.066
All good.

26:51.151 --> 26:54.529
I've seen this film, like, ten times.

26:54.612 --> 26:55.780
Okay.

26:55.864 --> 26:59.492
The Bug does not do fanboy,

26:59.576 --> 27:03.913
but if you wanted, you could tell him,
you know, nice work.

27:04.789 --> 27:06.082
Really?

27:07.125 --> 27:08.418
-Tell him yourself.
-What?

27:08.501 --> 27:09.961
He's sitting right there.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.174
Holy shit.

27:14.257 --> 27:15.717
Be cool, Bug.

27:19.637 --> 27:20.805
Perdón?

27:21.639 --> 27:25.685
[in broken Spanish]
Major honor, Mr. Rodriguez.

27:27.645 --> 27:28.772
Thank you.

27:28.855 --> 27:30.357
You speak Spanish?

27:30.940 --> 27:34.944
The language of love
is the Bug's native tongue.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.780
I thought that was French.

27:41.701 --> 27:42.702
[man gasps]

27:44.287 --> 27:45.622
[applause]

27:53.088 --> 27:54.381
Love this part.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.929
[grunts]

28:04.933 --> 28:06.559
"No more lies."

28:10.146 --> 28:15.193
-"No more lies!"
-No more lies!

28:15.485 --> 28:18.446
[crowd cheering, applauding]

28:19.948 --> 28:21.699
Always gets me.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.958
This is where it belongs. This is it.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.085
Mm. I love it.

28:32.168 --> 28:33.086
Ah!

28:33.169 --> 28:36.047
-The light of my life. You remember Ajay.
-Of course.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.801
Ajay is laying out the plans
for the new tower.

28:39.884 --> 28:43.304
21st Century India.
And we are building it right here.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.682
Yeah. Very impressive.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.059
-You texted?
-I did.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.061
Um, excuse us, please.

28:52.063 --> 28:54.149
-I'll be back.
-My office.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.318
Could be up there someday.

28:57.402 --> 28:58.903
[chuckles]

29:01.197 --> 29:02.490
Now, how can I help?

29:03.283 --> 29:04.993
I wanted to go over the reports.

29:05.076 --> 29:08.747
I'm finding inconsistencies between
our drug samples and the quality reports,

29:08.830 --> 29:12.041
and I'm very confused by some of the data
from the controller general.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.585
I wouldn't really stress out about it.

29:13.668 --> 29:16.212
I mean, all the CG really wants
from us is for us to say

29:16.296 --> 29:18.131
that we are doing the best we can.

29:18.214 --> 29:20.592
I've been through it a million times
with the lawyers. Really.

29:20.675 --> 29:24.262
I mean, these reports are mostly done
for the sake of appearances.

29:24.345 --> 29:27.640
-But--
-What matters is that we ship on time.

29:27.724 --> 29:31.144
Our clients are depending on us,
as I am depending on you.

29:33.104 --> 29:34.272
Come, let's go.

29:39.486 --> 29:42.155
So, Bug, where is he?

29:42.238 --> 29:43.198
[Bug] Who?

29:43.698 --> 29:45.909
You said we were meeting your guy here.

29:45.992 --> 29:49.329
Not my guy, the guy.

29:49.412 --> 29:50.914
Well, where is he?

29:51.623 --> 29:53.041
-[man] Et voilà.
-[Bug gasps]

29:54.292 --> 29:55.126
[man] I'm the guy.

29:55.210 --> 29:58.838
-Holy shit.
-Shh! Be cool.

30:00.590 --> 30:01.841
[man] Hello, Nomi Marks.

30:04.594 --> 30:05.637
You know who I am?

30:05.720 --> 30:07.430
[man] We've had our eyes on you.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.766
That's kind of cool and kind of creepy.

30:09.849 --> 30:12.519
[man] Yeah, it sounded a little stalkery.
Didn't mean it like that.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.103
What did you mean?

30:14.854 --> 30:17.565
[man] Bug's been a bud for a while.
We know what you did for him.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.567
When he told us about your troubles,

30:19.651 --> 30:22.821
we looked into it, shall we say...
anonymously.

30:22.904 --> 30:26.324
-And what did you find?
-How many languages do you speak?

30:29.285 --> 30:33.581
Seven. And, you know,
some shitty French from high school.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.458
[man] You're Homo sensorium.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.461
You know about us?

30:38.545 --> 30:42.006
[man] Anyone that's interested
in the truth knows about Homo sensorium.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.801
And those three unpleasant letters.

30:45.385 --> 30:46.427
BPO.

30:48.012 --> 30:49.472
Who are they?

30:49.556 --> 30:53.184
[man] Another secret security organization
that needs to be taken down.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.770
-How?
-[man] We don't know.

30:55.854 --> 30:59.899
They have more money and more autonomy
than any other group we've come across.

30:59.983 --> 31:03.903
But ultimately, all that power
testifies to one thing.

31:03.987 --> 31:07.448
-What?
-How afraid they are of people like you.

31:09.284 --> 31:15.039
Right now, all we can offer you
is a little... invisibility.

31:15.790 --> 31:16.624
E-Death.

31:17.625 --> 31:21.754
[man] If you accept this offer, there may
come a day when we ask something of you.

31:22.505 --> 31:23.339
What?

31:23.423 --> 31:26.134
[man] Nothing venal, vile or vainglorious.

31:26.217 --> 31:29.345
Rather a vital vertex of virtue,

31:29.429 --> 31:32.265
valor and virtuosity
in the name of veracity.

31:32.974 --> 31:36.144
Wow. Did you just come up
with that yourself?

31:36.227 --> 31:38.771
-[man] No. There's an app for it.
-Ah.

31:38.855 --> 31:43.026
[crowd applauding, cheering]

31:59.459 --> 32:00.460
Hello?

32:03.421 --> 32:04.756
Fuchs?

32:04.839 --> 32:06.424
Anybody home?

32:09.719 --> 32:10.762
Felix?

32:12.722 --> 32:13.932
Hello?

32:14.933 --> 32:16.809
[softly] Where the fuck is everybody?

32:27.528 --> 32:28.363
Pretty, isn't it?

32:29.739 --> 32:30.907
Where's Fuchs?

32:33.034 --> 32:34.327
Shanghai.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.538
So there was no meeting.

32:40.124 --> 32:43.503
I thought it was time for us
to get to know each other a little better.

32:43.586 --> 32:45.546
[sighs]

32:52.387 --> 32:54.138
What do you want from me?

32:54.931 --> 32:57.100
Am I being too subtle?

33:00.144 --> 33:03.731
-Playing hard to get?
-I'm not interested in playing at all.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.901
Wolfgang, I'm sorry I lied
about the Fuchs meeting,

33:06.985 --> 33:09.445
but it's getting very complicated.

33:10.279 --> 33:12.031
You know what's going on, don't you?

33:12.699 --> 33:15.535
Fuchs left town. You're following Volker.
It's not rocket science.

33:15.618 --> 33:19.497
He's going after the other kings.
That's his choice.

33:19.580 --> 33:22.834
Maybe it will work out for Sebastian,
maybe it won't.

33:22.917 --> 33:25.169
What I'm going to make sure
is that it works out for me.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.087
Hm.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.880
-And maybe--
-Me.

33:29.716 --> 33:32.844
It's been a while since I've met one of us
as tempting as you.

33:35.304 --> 33:36.681
I told you, I'm not interested.

33:38.182 --> 33:42.854
You might not want to admit it...
but we need each other.

33:43.646 --> 33:46.357
You're wrong. I don't need anyone.

33:50.903 --> 33:54.157
[doorbell rings]

34:00.830 --> 34:03.041
[man] Hello. [clears throat]

34:04.125 --> 34:07.545
Mun. From Seoul Metropolitan Police.

34:09.714 --> 34:12.050
I was hoping to talk to you about Sun Bak.

34:13.134 --> 34:16.763
Hope is undiscovered disappointment.

34:18.681 --> 34:20.475
I hope to keep her alive.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.436
Do you?

34:23.519 --> 34:25.271
[clears throat]

34:28.232 --> 34:30.985
-Come on.
-Thank you.

34:35.448 --> 34:36.741
You, uh...

34:37.909 --> 34:40.328
Oh, thank you.

34:41.829 --> 34:43.331
You know her well, don't you?

34:44.749 --> 34:46.209
I was her teacher.

34:47.251 --> 34:50.129
When I was a young man, I fought her once.

34:50.213 --> 34:52.090
But she used a different name.

34:52.173 --> 34:55.551
Her father did not approve
of women fighting.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.096
Ah.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.641
I was stupid like him, too.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.108
I was cocky.

35:19.909 --> 35:21.494
And then she kicked my ass.

35:22.912 --> 35:25.039
She did that a lot.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.938
I never forgot it.

36:00.950 --> 36:03.995
[laughs] But I became better
because of her, though.

36:05.663 --> 36:09.375
Many people have made up their mind
about Ms. Bak,

36:09.458 --> 36:13.171
and I was wondering about you.

36:13.254 --> 36:18.509
Do you think she has done all the things
that she's been accused of?

36:19.093 --> 36:22.889
The person I trained? The person I know?

36:23.723 --> 36:27.518
This is not the same person
the TV talks about.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.355
[grunts]

36:32.690 --> 36:37.361
Just between the two of us, something
stinks in the story of her escape.

36:37.445 --> 36:41.741
For some reason, the security camera
covering her cell was out,

36:41.824 --> 36:44.243
as was the one in the laundry hall.

36:44.327 --> 36:48.206
And the guards, they were not
from the prison. They came from Seoul.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.211
Mm.

36:53.294 --> 36:55.421
The tea is still warm.
Did you just have a guest?

36:57.006 --> 36:58.257
A friend.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.551
I figured.

37:03.679 --> 37:07.308
Ms. Bak, I think, could use a friend.

37:09.435 --> 37:15.733
Look, what she's trying to do,
as good as she is... she cannot do alone.

37:20.029 --> 37:21.197
Thanks for the tea.

37:40.424 --> 37:42.551
-How long will it take?
-I don't know.

37:42.635 --> 37:45.179
I never redacted anyone before.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.813
Uh-oh. What was that?

37:53.896 --> 37:56.482
[Bug typing]

37:58.150 --> 37:59.986
[beeping]

38:01.654 --> 38:03.197
-Oh, my God.
-What?

38:03.281 --> 38:06.867
I alarmed the police reports on you and...
Jesus.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.619
-What?
-They're gone.

38:08.703 --> 38:12.164
BOLO's gone, wants and warrants gone,
person of interest gone.

38:12.915 --> 38:14.917
[computer beeping]

38:15.001 --> 38:17.420
Shit.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.048
[gasps]

38:21.132 --> 38:22.425
It's official.

38:24.176 --> 38:25.761
I'm dead.

38:48.492 --> 38:49.410
Hello.

38:50.411 --> 38:51.996
It's good to see you.

38:52.079 --> 38:53.706
Good to see you, too.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.292
Tequila?

38:56.959 --> 38:59.170
-Please.
-Squared?

38:59.837 --> 39:00.671
Cubed.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.007
Eight?

39:03.090 --> 39:04.592
Eight.

39:07.636 --> 39:12.433
I've been hoping you would come back,
so I could say thank you.

39:12.516 --> 39:13.768
Why?

39:13.851 --> 39:15.936
When you burst in here the last time,

39:16.020 --> 39:21.025
you were so full of fire
and with a sense of fearlessness.

39:21.108 --> 39:23.069
And then you kissed me and...

39:24.028 --> 39:29.075
Well, let's just say I was... inspired.

39:29.825 --> 39:34.622
I got home that night
and I proposed to my boyfriend,

39:34.705 --> 39:36.165
and we got married.

39:37.458 --> 39:40.002
That's my Pepe there.

39:43.089 --> 39:44.131
Hello, Pepe.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.549
How are you?

39:45.633 --> 39:48.719
We had the best year of our lives.

39:49.512 --> 39:55.643
But I know I would have never been brave
enough to do it... without that kiss.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.606
Courage. It is contagious.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.360
Well, the drink's on us.

40:04.693 --> 40:05.528
Thank you.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.254
He's right.

40:24.964 --> 40:27.466
Nothing changes if we keep
playing it safe.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.344
Look at me.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.388
Look at us.

40:34.598 --> 40:36.517
We're hiding in holes.

40:37.226 --> 40:38.811
Whispers has turned me into a fugitive.

40:38.894 --> 40:41.647
He's got me acting like one
and thinking like one.

40:41.730 --> 40:42.815
I'm not.

40:45.067 --> 40:46.318
I'm a cop.

40:52.241 --> 40:56.120
A fugitive runs because he's alone.

40:56.203 --> 40:58.456
A cop knows he's not.

41:01.041 --> 41:03.127
Whispers showed me something.

41:03.210 --> 41:04.628
Something I've been missing.

41:04.712 --> 41:06.964
It's the scale of this fight.

41:07.965 --> 41:10.676
Why does BPO have so many resources?

41:12.428 --> 41:15.806
It has to be because there is a lot more
of us out there than we thought.

41:17.016 --> 41:19.143
-We need...
-...to find them.

41:29.403 --> 41:31.697
[indistinct dialogue]

41:31.780 --> 41:33.741
[crowd cheering]

41:43.667 --> 41:45.503
Vincent, this is Riley.

41:47.213 --> 41:49.673
We risked so much to get you free, Riley.

41:49.757 --> 41:53.594
It seems very dangerous to me,
exposing ourselves like this.

41:57.306 --> 41:59.600
Vincent offered us protection.

41:59.683 --> 42:04.605
Guys, are we really going to put our lives
in the hands of someone like Vincent?

42:07.525 --> 42:09.401
What do you mean someone like Vincent?

42:09.485 --> 42:11.320
-Someone who--
-Doesn't like his movies.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.573
Nah. Nah.

42:15.407 --> 42:18.118
Well, I mean, taste in movies
says a lot about someone.

42:19.828 --> 42:20.913
Sun?

42:24.792 --> 42:27.711
You can't win a fight protecting yourself.

42:38.389 --> 42:39.848
Nomi?

42:39.932 --> 42:42.560
A coded media alert
can make it almost impossible

42:42.643 --> 42:44.353
for cops to respond fast enough.

42:44.436 --> 42:48.399
Not just the plan.
What do you think about the risk itself?

42:50.651 --> 42:54.655
Your life is either defined
by the system...

42:56.490 --> 42:58.701
or by the way you defy the system.

43:02.162 --> 43:03.581
Wolfgang?

43:05.958 --> 43:07.668
Fear never fixed anything.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.096
To courage.

43:27.229 --> 43:31.108
[upbeat rock music plays]

43:37.114 --> 43:39.825
[man] The one and only Riley Blue!

43:44.038 --> 43:46.874
[music continues]

44:11.815 --> 44:14.526
-Uh... hi.
-[crowd cheering]

44:19.281 --> 44:21.283
I don't usually talk up here.

44:23.327 --> 44:26.163
But I need to say something
I should have said a year ago.

44:27.831 --> 44:31.877
I wasted a lot of my life
with my eyes looking down.

44:34.505 --> 44:36.757
Afraid of anything beyond the next step.

44:39.426 --> 44:41.428
And then something happened to me.

44:44.306 --> 44:46.183
Someone reminded me to look up.

44:48.644 --> 44:51.438
And I wanted to tell that someone
thank you.

44:53.899 --> 44:56.318
I wanted to tell you that I love you.

44:57.945 --> 44:59.321
I love you.

45:09.039 --> 45:14.670
Tonight, I want everyone in this room
to know... that I see you.

45:16.797 --> 45:18.173
I believe in you.

45:21.260 --> 45:23.137
And as long as we're together...

45:27.433 --> 45:30.227
I know that there's nothing we can't do.

45:30.310 --> 45:33.272
[music continues]

45:41.655 --> 45:44.533
[electronic music plays]

46:37.920 --> 46:39.588
Holy shit!

47:05.906 --> 47:07.699
This was careless, Will.

47:07.783 --> 47:10.577
No. This was amazing.

47:12.329 --> 47:15.666
-The cops are coming.
-Cops are coming. We gotta get her out.

47:18.961 --> 47:20.254
See you soon, Milt.

47:22.464 --> 47:25.217
-Sorry, love. Fun's over.
-He's the club owner. Come on.

47:25.300 --> 47:26.510
-Gotta go.
-Cops are coming.

47:26.593 --> 47:27.719
Gotta go! Gotta go!

47:37.020 --> 47:38.438
[crowd shouting]

47:39.648 --> 47:42.025
Oh! No! You idiots! No! Outside!

47:43.110 --> 47:44.069
Outside!
