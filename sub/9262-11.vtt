WEBVTT

00:01.109 --> 00:03.258
Previously on "the shield"...
Guillermo Beltran...

00:03.425 --> 00:04.968
the Guerrero drug cartel
head of security.

00:05.135 --> 00:07.023
You heard Vic turned in
his badge yesterday?

00:07.190 --> 00:09.838
That leaves me to be
your most important instrument

00:10.005 --> 00:12.038
in the Guerrero cartel
investigation.

00:12.371 --> 00:14.338
We're not sure you're valuable
to this investigation.

00:14.749 --> 00:17.538
Just give me some time to get
cozied up to this Beltran guy.

00:17.877 --> 00:18.704
You want to prove yourself
to me?

00:19.045 --> 00:20.804
I never want to see
Pezuela again.

00:21.172 --> 00:22.004
Beltran sent me
to kill you.

00:22.340 --> 00:24.105
Lucky for you,
I work for Olivia Murray.

00:24.272 --> 00:26.271
I'm gonna need you
to give me back her file

00:26.438 --> 00:28.038
before I can bring you in.

00:28.346 --> 00:30.271
We have to convince Beltran
that I took out Pezuela.

00:30.556 --> 00:32.371
A colleague of yours
committed suicide tonight.

00:32.642 --> 00:35.004
That means there'll be a hole
in your organization.

00:35.311 --> 00:36.238
Where do I submit
an application?

00:36.562 --> 00:39.405
Shane Vendrell hired you
to kill Gardocki?

00:39.690 --> 00:41.538
Why does Vendrell
want you dead?

00:41.901 --> 00:44.205
Vic thinks that Shane was
waiting at his place last night.

00:44.529 --> 00:46.771
There's a reward waiting
for anyone who can deliver him.

00:47.114 --> 00:49.238
Your cop buddy's paying 10 g's
for your head, ese.

00:49.617 --> 00:50.771
You got almost 100 grand
in there.

00:50.938 --> 00:52.405
That's more than enough
to keep walking.

00:52.572 --> 00:54.771
As punishment for the
shit you tried to pull today,

00:54.938 --> 00:57.038
there is a written confession
of one of your many sins

00:57.205 --> 00:59.171
on its way to the Barn,
addressed to claduette Wyms.

00:59.502 --> 01:01.771
Since you caused us
to lose all of our cash today,

01:01.938 --> 01:03.171
you're gonna replace it.

01:03.338 --> 01:05.298
We got to figure out a way
to put a hundred grand

01:05.550 --> 01:07.405
- in Shane's hands by tomorrow afternoon.
- I'm gonna run.

01:07.802 --> 01:09.338
Give me one last shot.

01:09.505 --> 01:11.737
If I fail,
we'll both run.

01:12.056 --> 01:12.904
Mara,
this is Claudette Wyms.

01:13.224 --> 01:15.472
All I want from this
is Vic Mackey.

01:15.639 --> 01:17.238
Corrine's working
with the police.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:31.605 --> 01:34.505
Think Mara
changed her mind?

01:34.829 --> 01:37.171
Does anyone want
any coffee?

01:37.456 --> 01:38.438
Uh, thanks, but no.

01:47.904 --> 01:49.105
Hello.

01:49.272 --> 01:50.343
Put on Claudette.

01:50.605 --> 01:52.261
She wants to talk to you.

01:52.538 --> 01:54.889
I'm glad you called.

01:55.205 --> 01:56.849
My husband's given Vic
a 5:00 deadline

01:57.101 --> 01:59.518
to come up with $100,000.

01:59.770 --> 02:00.853
Okay.

02:01.171 --> 02:03.522
Corrine is supposed to hand
the money to Shane

02:03.871 --> 02:06.271
by the fountain
in Hollenbeck park.

02:06.438 --> 02:08.138
I appreciate you
working with us.

02:08.305 --> 02:09.652
Promise Shane won't
get hurt.

02:09.937 --> 02:11.338
I promise.

02:11.505 --> 02:14.771
'Cause I know how some suspects
wind up dead getting booked.

02:14.938 --> 02:18.438
You are going to make sure
that every cop in that park

02:18.605 --> 02:21.771
understands that Shane
going after Vic and Ronnie

02:21.938 --> 02:23.138
was self-defense.

02:23.305 --> 02:25.920
So, he'll cooperate
with us?

02:26.272 --> 02:27.704
I can get him to cooperate.

02:27.871 --> 02:30.538
But he's gonna have to
get something in exchange.

02:30.705 --> 02:33.305
I'll do everything I can.
That's not good enough.

02:33.472 --> 02:35.763
You need to guarantee
that he'll get a light sentence.

02:37.038 --> 02:39.600
Otherwise, I will blow this
whole thing out of the water!

02:42.538 --> 02:46.505
I will work it out
with the D.A.

02:46.672 --> 02:48.572
Just make sure
he's treated okay.

02:54.672 --> 02:56.909
That's beautiful.

02:57.305 --> 02:58.405
That was beautiful, baby.

02:59.871 --> 03:02.604
We just walked Vic and a bag
of dirty money into a bust.

03:02.771 --> 03:03.938
We never have to worry

03:04.105 --> 03:06.438
about that prick coming after us
ever again.

03:06.605 --> 03:08.804
The only problem
with getting Vic arrested

03:08.971 --> 03:11.371
is that we lose any leverage
to negotiate a deal

03:11.538 --> 03:12.771
if we ever get caught.

03:12.938 --> 03:14.572
Well, that's why we absolutely
can't get caught,

03:14.739 --> 03:16.071
'cause I'm not going
to prison.

03:16.238 --> 03:18.739
And I'm sure as hell not
gonna let you end up there.

03:21.038 --> 03:22.771
When Vic makes contact
with you,

03:23.229 --> 03:25.171
you're hearing all this
for the first time.

03:25.564 --> 03:27.105
You go along with it
reluctantly.

03:27.272 --> 03:28.604
Don't sign on too easily.

03:28.771 --> 03:30.538
Believe me,
having a problem with all this

03:30.705 --> 03:31.737
won't be a stretch.

03:31.904 --> 03:33.704
I don't want you wired
for your initial meet.

03:33.871 --> 03:35.438
Vic's a master
at smelling a setup.

03:35.605 --> 03:36.971
But when he hands over
that money,

03:37.138 --> 03:38.338
we'll be recording it.

03:38.505 --> 03:40.911
How does Vic not figure out
that I set him up?

03:42.305 --> 03:45.472
We'll play as if he's been
under surveillance for a while.

03:45.639 --> 03:46.671
We'll go
through the motions

03:46.838 --> 03:47.543
of arresting you
to sell your cover.

03:47.904 --> 03:49.305
I don't like this.

03:49.472 --> 03:52.305
I mean, what if Vic finds out or
something goes wrong with Shane?

03:52.472 --> 03:54.004
We will take
every precaution.

03:54.171 --> 03:56.138
You came to us
to get Vic out of your life,

03:56.305 --> 03:57.904
to close the book on him
forever.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.438
Let's do that.

03:59.605 --> 04:03.171
How does somebody
get witness protection?

04:03.338 --> 04:06.305
You'll have to testify.

04:06.472 --> 04:07.838
That's not gonna happen.

04:08.005 --> 04:09.838
Like I said,
Vic can never find out

04:10.005 --> 04:11.637
that I helped put him in prison.

04:11.804 --> 04:12.904
It's his own doing.

04:15.205 --> 04:18.491
Then why do I still feel ashamed
about this?

04:22.639 --> 04:25.238
Little overdressed
for your paper route.

04:25.405 --> 04:26.904
Pezuela's grieving widow.

04:27.071 --> 04:30.438
Obit mourns "an international
business guru's tragic suicide."

04:30.605 --> 04:31.971
His shrink should be sued

04:32.138 --> 04:34.704
for not recognizing
the seven warning signs.

04:34.871 --> 04:36.509
Only Pezuela wasn't
suicidal.

04:36.771 --> 04:38.538
Oh, it just goes
to show you...

04:38.705 --> 04:41.737
you never really know what's
going on inside someone's head.

04:41.904 --> 04:43.938
Suicide my ass.
Beltran had him whacked.

04:44.105 --> 04:46.871
The only question is whether
or not he used you to do it.

04:47.038 --> 04:48.704
Hey, whoa, you're giving me

04:48.871 --> 04:51.238
a hell of a lot
of credit there, Dave.

04:51.405 --> 04:53.438
Olivia's not returning
any of my phone calls.

04:53.605 --> 04:55.904
Now you drop a body
in the middle of my campaign?

04:56.071 --> 04:58.737
Well, you were the last one seen
mud wrestling with Pezuela.

04:58.904 --> 05:01.071
You're not screwing up
my investigation

05:01.238 --> 05:04.305
and costing me the mayor's job
with one last scandal, Vic.

05:04.472 --> 05:07.804
Nice to know that justice is
still your number-one priority.

05:16.871 --> 05:18.004
Hello.

05:18.171 --> 05:20.671
Corrine, I need to see you
A.S.A.P. It's important.

05:20.838 --> 05:22.871
I'm on my way to work, Vic.
What's up?

05:23.038 --> 05:24.771
It's not something I can
get into over the phone.

05:24.938 --> 05:25.904
Can you take
a personal day?

05:26.071 --> 05:27.171
What's wrong, Vic?

05:27.338 --> 05:29.505
Meet me by the fountain
in Hollenbeck park.

05:29.672 --> 05:31.871
How soon can you be there?

05:33.538 --> 05:35.205
Vic, this is crazy.

05:35.372 --> 05:36.771
It's gonna be fine.

05:36.938 --> 05:38.538
Just meet me here
at 5:00.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.971
And you're gonna give me
a bagful of money

05:41.138 --> 05:43.205
to give to the guy
who tried to kill you.

05:43.372 --> 05:45.305
So Shane can take his wife
and his kid

05:45.472 --> 05:48.171
and this whole Vendrell
shitstorm out of the country.

05:48.338 --> 05:49.938
What if he tries
to hurt me?

05:50.105 --> 05:53.138
He saved you once
from the armenians.

05:53.305 --> 05:55.796
It's me he wants to hurt,
not you.

05:57.938 --> 06:00.838
Maybe we shouldn't
do this, Vic.

06:01.005 --> 06:02.572
When Shane calls,

06:02.739 --> 06:05.971
tell him he's on his own
or blame it on me.

06:06.138 --> 06:07.405
I...

06:07.572 --> 06:10.771
I just need you to do
this one last favor for me.

06:24.372 --> 06:25.005
You certainly
caught yourself a break...

06:26.171 --> 06:28.238
Pezuela's narrow-mindedness
being cremated

06:28.405 --> 06:29.771
along with the rest
of him.

06:29.938 --> 06:31.071
Narrow-minded how?

06:31.238 --> 06:35.971
I can understand him
being down with la raza,

06:36.138 --> 06:38.338
but 40% of the drug trade
in this city

06:38.505 --> 06:40.171
is black-owned
and -operated.

06:40.338 --> 06:42.472
Never could
get that prick interested

06:42.639 --> 06:44.038
in affirmative action.

06:44.205 --> 06:46.737
Our experience with the blacks
in phoenix, San diego

06:46.904 --> 06:47.971
has never been good.

06:48.138 --> 06:50.472
Well, that's because
you don't have a trade rep

06:50.639 --> 06:51.771
fluent in the culture,

06:51.938 --> 06:54.138
and that's costing you
market share.

06:54.305 --> 06:56.138
You would be
an upgrade, huh?

06:56.305 --> 06:58.138
A white cop
who's made a career

06:58.305 --> 07:00.737
cracking the heads
of low-level gangbangers.

07:00.904 --> 07:03.138
You would be surprised
at how much sense

07:03.305 --> 07:06.205
I've knocked into some
of those heads over the years.

07:06.372 --> 07:08.505
If I was interested...

07:08.672 --> 07:10.105
well, then,
I'd set up a meet and greet

07:10.272 --> 07:11.904
with you and the black board
of directors,

07:12.071 --> 07:14.704
offer to become
their exclusive supplier

07:14.871 --> 07:16.871
below current
wholesale cost.

07:17.038 --> 07:20.138
Year or two,
you'd have a monopoly.

07:20.305 --> 07:21.938
I don't meet and greet.

07:22.105 --> 07:26.105
Sure, want to minimize your
exposure to law enforcement.

07:26.272 --> 07:31.205
I'd be happy to take
the meeting, negotiate terms.

07:33.138 --> 07:36.138
I would need
a substantial security deposit

07:36.305 --> 07:39.038
from the blacks
as a show of good faith.

07:39.205 --> 07:41.105
Of course.

07:41.272 --> 07:43.271
What you need, Mackey?

07:43.438 --> 07:47.505
Well, back in the day,
we had an understanding.

07:47.672 --> 07:50.971
We did?
I don't recall that far back.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.904
Just two dinosaurs
sitting down now.

07:54.071 --> 07:57.071
I need to arrange a meet
with your board of directors.

07:57.238 --> 07:59.004
I got
a business opportunity.

07:59.171 --> 08:01.438
Business? What do you know
about our business?

08:01.605 --> 08:04.305
You and your five-o crew
only swarm on the street level.

08:04.472 --> 08:06.171
Thought it was about time

08:06.338 --> 08:08.771
I started using
my entrepreneurial skills...

08:08.938 --> 08:10.604
go to work
for the other side.

08:10.771 --> 08:13.105
Mm-hmm, so, you come to me
and the board with this

08:13.272 --> 08:17.338
'cause Vic Mackey is all about
the black man rising?

08:17.505 --> 08:20.171
I don't give a shit
about the black man.

08:20.338 --> 08:22.038
I'm just looking to earn.

08:23.505 --> 08:25.671
I'm guessing that's
the first honest thing

08:25.838 --> 08:27.038
you've said in a month.

08:27.205 --> 08:31.004
I'm gonna need to think on this
for a minute.

08:31.171 --> 08:33.538
Beltran's still
taking my temperature,

08:33.705 --> 08:35.105
but he'll come around.

08:35.272 --> 08:37.472
The goal is getting him
to trust you to the point

08:37.639 --> 08:39.938
where you have access
to the cartel's inner workings.

08:40.105 --> 08:41.971
Has he mentioned
any illegal dealings yet?

08:42.138 --> 08:44.771
He's still
playing it quiet.

08:44.938 --> 08:46.472
Pezuela
give you anything?

08:46.639 --> 08:49.271
Besides attitude?
He's an uncooperative shithead.

08:49.438 --> 08:51.438
No worries...
only a matter of time

08:51.605 --> 08:53.804
before I know everything
he knows and more.

08:53.971 --> 08:55.171
I hope that includes

08:55.338 --> 08:57.171
what he did with
the blackmail box and my file.

08:57.338 --> 08:59.338
I turned his world upside down
looking for it,

08:59.505 --> 09:01.271
and still no luck.

09:01.438 --> 09:04.338
Good news is,
with Pezuela in custody,

09:04.505 --> 09:06.938
he can't get to it
to use it against you.

09:07.105 --> 09:09.538
It doesn't mean
somebody else won't.

09:09.705 --> 09:11.305
Iook, I got two jobs...

09:11.472 --> 09:13.804
gathering enough intel
against Beltran and the cartel

09:13.971 --> 09:16.505
to deliver I.C.E.
Their biggest bust to date

09:16.672 --> 09:18.971
and cover your ass
by finding that file.

09:19.138 --> 09:21.138
I intend to come through
on both.

09:24.538 --> 09:25.472
Yeah.

09:25.639 --> 09:27.105
Meet is on.

09:27.272 --> 09:30.938
72 pine bluff, inglewood.

09:31.105 --> 09:32.804
2:00 P.M.
That was quick.

09:32.971 --> 09:34.305
What you think, man?

09:34.472 --> 09:37.272
Men's jail is headquarters,
baby.

09:46.572 --> 09:48.804
Something you need?

09:48.971 --> 09:52.038
This new guy handing out
the mail must be dyslexic.

09:52.205 --> 09:53.904
They keep
mixing up our mail.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.271
When's Danny coming back?

09:55.438 --> 09:56.472
Unis responded
to a shooting.

09:56.639 --> 09:58.121
Victim pronounced
at the scene.

09:58.457 --> 10:00.004
Steve!
Need you, too!

10:00.171 --> 10:02.271
Kid's name
is Cardell Rhodes,

10:02.438 --> 10:04.538
gunned down
outside his house.

10:04.705 --> 10:05.971
Cardell Rhodes?
The football player?

10:06.138 --> 10:07.505
You know him?

10:07.672 --> 10:09.338
Yeah, coached him in
pop Warner. I'm sorry.

10:09.505 --> 10:11.604
I need you and Steve
to get on over there.

10:11.771 --> 10:14.238
But I thought I was still supposed
to be riding a desk? Well, not today.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.071
I've got everyone available
sweeping the streets

10:16.238 --> 10:17.704
ahead
of the presidential motorcade.

10:17.871 --> 10:19.771
Stash houses, dealers,
hookers, the whole nine.

10:19.938 --> 10:21.971
Well, much as I want out
of my forced detention,

10:22.138 --> 10:24.205
Julien's history with the kid
gives him a leg up here.

10:24.372 --> 10:25.505
You're right.
Go with Ronnie.

10:25.672 --> 10:27.771
What's up?
Uh, never mind.

10:27.938 --> 10:29.671
There was another victim,
minor injuries...

10:29.838 --> 10:30.938
he was treated
at the scene.

10:31.105 --> 10:32.338
I'm going back
to my crosswords.

10:33.705 --> 10:35.704
I'll meet you outside.

10:35.871 --> 10:39.305
Hey, Steve. Steve.
I need you to do me a solid.

10:39.472 --> 10:43.138
I took a bedroom tumble
with a woman on the force.

10:43.305 --> 10:45.472
She found out she's not the only
teeter-totter on the playground,

10:45.639 --> 10:46.737
got pissed,

10:46.904 --> 10:47.938
now she's trying
to jam me up with Claudette.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.405
This chick wrote a letter
to Claudette

10:50.572 --> 10:52.138
laying the whole thing out.

10:52.305 --> 10:54.071
Should stand out as personal.

10:54.238 --> 10:55.338
I've been trying
to intercept it,

10:55.505 --> 10:56.671
but now I got to work this case
with Julien.

10:56.838 --> 10:59.071
You know, Ron, you and me,
we've had our friction.

10:59.238 --> 11:00.637
But in a world
of crazy coozes,

11:00.804 --> 11:02.171
trust me,
I got your back.

11:02.338 --> 11:04.904
That poison pantygram
won't hit Claudette's desk.

11:05.071 --> 11:06.238
Thanks, man.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.704
First mail delivery came in...
nothing.

11:13.871 --> 11:15.171
Shit.

11:15.534 --> 11:17.105
Might not come until
this afternoon, maybe tomorrow.

11:17.272 --> 11:19.238
Or maybe not at all. He could
just be screwing with us.

11:19.405 --> 11:20.538
Ah, we can't
take that chance.

11:20.705 --> 11:22.737
Good news is,
you're trapped at the Barn.

11:22.904 --> 11:25.604
Was. Claudette just put me
on a 187 with Julien.

11:25.771 --> 11:26.572
You can't bail?

11:26.739 --> 11:28.838
Believe me, I tried.

11:29.005 --> 11:30.238
How's that other thing
going?

11:30.405 --> 11:32.238
One minute.
One minute.

11:32.405 --> 11:34.305
I think I see a play
with the cartel.

11:34.472 --> 11:35.438
More on that later.

11:35.605 --> 11:36.804
That sounds kind of iffy.

11:36.971 --> 11:39.538
I don't do "if."
I'm only about "when."

11:39.705 --> 11:41.472
Hey, wake up.

11:54.538 --> 11:57.671
All right, I put something
over here for safekeeping.

11:57.838 --> 11:59.472
You all know
what I'm talking about.

11:59.639 --> 12:00.804
Now, where the hell is it?

12:00.971 --> 12:02.205
Huh?

12:05.672 --> 12:07.871
You think your quality
of life sucks now?

12:08.038 --> 12:09.704
You wait till I get done
with you.

12:09.871 --> 12:11.572
Now, where's my gun?

12:12.705 --> 12:14.338
Huh?

12:23.871 --> 12:25.771
Hey, dog's ass!

12:25.938 --> 12:28.138
I got to talk to you.

12:28.305 --> 12:29.938
Think pink
while you can, hero.

12:30.105 --> 12:34.838
You die now amongst the
righteous and the urine savior.

12:39.338 --> 12:41.038
It's not loaded, pigpen.

12:43.538 --> 12:44.938
I've arranged
the trade summit...

12:45.105 --> 12:46.305
all the Senior management.

12:46.472 --> 12:48.737
Just need to know
how much weight you can provide.

12:48.904 --> 12:50.737
It's a tempting opportunity

12:50.904 --> 12:53.238
to eliminate the competition
in one fell swoop.

12:53.405 --> 12:55.637
Absorbing them into
your corporate structure

12:55.804 --> 12:57.871
means less waves,
more profit.

12:58.038 --> 13:00.038
Pezuela was here for how long

13:00.205 --> 13:02.305
and he never moved
past the byz lat level?

13:02.472 --> 13:04.505
Pezuela.

13:04.672 --> 13:06.305
Pezuela
was a waste of clothes.

13:06.472 --> 13:08.971
But he did manage
to renovate this place

13:09.138 --> 13:12.038
and build a few others
to store our product...

13:12.205 --> 13:14.604
over budget
and behind schedule.

13:14.771 --> 13:18.305
You're gonna fill
this whole place with drugs?

13:18.472 --> 13:21.804
The blacks...
they understand the terms?

13:21.971 --> 13:22.838
They will.

13:23.005 --> 13:25.305
Disagreeable people.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.071
Well, they've gone through
some shit over the years.

13:28.238 --> 13:31.871
I'm gonna be walking
into an adversarial situation.

13:32.038 --> 13:34.405
You got a few guys
I can borrow?

13:34.572 --> 13:35.804
You forget, huh?

13:35.971 --> 13:38.238
My background
is professional military.

13:41.605 --> 13:43.071
Cardell and I are talking,

13:43.238 --> 13:44.904
he dives on top of me,
pulls me down.

13:45.071 --> 13:47.171
Then I hear gunshots.
Kid saved my life.

13:47.338 --> 13:48.438
How'd you know Cardell?

13:48.605 --> 13:50.171
I'm out here
on a recruiting trip.

13:50.338 --> 13:53.038
Cardell was my prize get...
had him all but committed.

13:53.205 --> 13:55.472
He was on his way to a heisman,
had a special talent.

13:55.639 --> 13:57.472
Yeah, his field vision
was one of a kind.

13:57.639 --> 13:59.472
That kid had eyes
in the back of his head.

13:59.639 --> 14:00.971
I coached him
a while back.

14:01.138 --> 14:03.004
You guys vet these kids
pretty thoroughly.

14:03.171 --> 14:04.671
Any problems
in his personal life?

14:04.838 --> 14:06.205
Enemies?
Look around.

14:06.372 --> 14:09.071
Shit you have to put up with
to get a bcs bid...

14:09.238 --> 14:10.671
take a banger to brunch.

14:10.838 --> 14:13.138
- Rhodes was affiliated?
- No way.

14:13.305 --> 14:14.604
I had to get permission
from the shot caller

14:14.771 --> 14:15.739
just to get a sit-down
with the kid.

14:16.904 --> 14:18.205
I'll talk to his mother.

14:21.038 --> 14:24.338
He was a child of God.

14:24.505 --> 14:26.904
But I don't
have to tell you that.

14:27.071 --> 14:28.405
You knew my baby.

14:28.572 --> 14:32.804
Do you have any idea
who might have done this?

14:32.971 --> 14:36.838
Why would
anyone want to hurt my baby?

14:39.238 --> 14:42.238
No!

14:49.938 --> 14:52.004
Hard to understand
why the good lord

14:52.171 --> 14:54.338
would let something
like this happen.

14:54.505 --> 14:56.804
I see it every day,
all day.

14:56.971 --> 14:58.671
Tests my faith,
believe me.

14:58.838 --> 15:01.737
Mister,
faith is all we got.

15:01.904 --> 15:04.904
I lost my son
last year, too.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.904
He was killed
in a drive-by.

15:07.071 --> 15:08.338
Sorry to hear that.

15:08.505 --> 15:10.472
So, they're saying
that all this happened

15:10.639 --> 15:12.904
because Cardell was
running around with a gang.

15:13.071 --> 15:14.704
You think that's what
this is about?

15:14.871 --> 15:16.038
No.

15:16.205 --> 15:17.938
Here's my card.

15:18.105 --> 15:20.272
If you hear anything,
give me a call.

15:27.505 --> 15:29.338
Recruiter says Cardell
was repping acorn park.

15:29.505 --> 15:31.572
How in the hell does he know
what goes on around here?

15:31.739 --> 15:33.038
Well, you heard him.

15:33.205 --> 15:35.205
He had to have a sit-down with
o.g. S just to talk to Cardell.

15:35.372 --> 15:37.572
That wasn't Cardell.
I knew him.

15:37.739 --> 15:38.938
I get your history
with the kid,

15:39.105 --> 15:40.871
but we got to look
at everything.

15:41.038 --> 15:42.505
That kid was the closest
thing to a hero

15:42.672 --> 15:43.938
this neighborhood ever had.

15:44.105 --> 15:45.704
And nothing would make me
happier than to be proved wrong.

15:45.871 --> 15:46.838
Let's chat
with the warring factions.

15:47.005 --> 15:48.804
You get with acorn park,

15:48.971 --> 15:51.505
and I'll discourse
with spook street.

15:51.672 --> 15:53.637
You're using
the I.C.E. Sting on Beltran

15:53.804 --> 15:55.671
to scam 100 grand
off of Beenie Spears' guys?

15:55.838 --> 15:57.138
Hail Mary,

15:57.305 --> 15:59.371
but I don't know how else
to come up with the money

15:59.538 --> 16:01.171
to buy off Shane,
given the time frame.

16:01.338 --> 16:03.338
Playing both sides like this
is crazy dangerous.

16:03.505 --> 16:04.704
How long before Beltran
or the board

16:04.871 --> 16:05.871
figure out
they're getting jacked

16:06.038 --> 16:07.572
and this thing goes nuclear?

16:07.739 --> 16:10.505
I only need to keep it together
a couple of days...

16:10.672 --> 16:12.771
enough time
to get Shane ghost,

16:12.938 --> 16:15.438
walk Beltran into a jackpot
so I.C.E. Can take him down

16:15.605 --> 16:19.271
in exchange for giving us
an overall deal and immunity.

16:19.438 --> 16:20.704
Jesus.

16:20.871 --> 16:22.704
I got Billings
back at the Barn

16:22.871 --> 16:25.438
intercepting Shane's letter...
nut-job plan.

16:25.605 --> 16:27.737
The wheels are coming off
the whole goddamn thing.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.871
I'm on the way
to this fund-raiser.

16:30.038 --> 16:32.737
I could really use some backup
that speaks inglés.

16:32.904 --> 16:36.737
Can't. Claudette's got me
hip-deep in some shit.

16:36.904 --> 16:38.105
Okay, no worries.

16:42.572 --> 16:44.739
God damn it.

16:47.572 --> 16:49.305
You know, you don't have to be
on the stakeout

16:49.472 --> 16:50.704
if you're not feeling
up to it.

16:50.871 --> 16:52.472
If you have
to take me there

16:52.639 --> 16:54.771
on a damn stretcher
with I.V. S running,

16:54.938 --> 16:57.838
I'll be there to take down
Vic Mackey and Shane Vendrell.

17:00.138 --> 17:01.938
You need help
finding something?

17:02.105 --> 17:04.938
I'm looking for my medicine.
It was here a minute ago.

17:05.105 --> 17:06.704
Um, is this it?

17:10.472 --> 17:12.637
Take it easy.

17:12.804 --> 17:15.003
How's Vic
gonna get the money?

17:15.171 --> 17:16.638
Somebody could get hurt
or worse.

17:19.105 --> 17:20.271
You wanted me?

17:20.438 --> 17:23.438
Vic been in communication
with Ronnie at all today?

17:23.605 --> 17:27.070
Ronnie's gotten a couple
of calls. Don't know who.

17:31.272 --> 17:33.271
We're moving on intel
that we're pretty convinced

17:33.438 --> 17:34.637
will give us Shane Vendrell.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.371
We have reason to believe

17:36.538 --> 17:38.205
we're gonna be making
another arrest...

17:38.372 --> 17:41.004
Vic Mackey
for aiding and abetting.

17:41.171 --> 17:43.572
If you're free
of the other case,

17:43.739 --> 17:44.771
I'd like you involved.

17:47.138 --> 17:50.405
I'll make myself available.
Just let me know when.

17:50.572 --> 17:51.871
I just want to give you
a heads-up

17:52.038 --> 17:53.637
so that you could
mentally prepare yourself

17:53.804 --> 17:55.538
to throw bracelets
on your former colleagues.

17:55.850 --> 17:57.405
Also, Ronnie and Vic
might be planning something.

17:57.572 --> 17:58.405
We don't know what.

17:58.572 --> 18:00.305
They were your teammates.

18:00.472 --> 18:03.038
It's pick-a-side time.

18:03.205 --> 18:05.371
If I get wind of anything,
you'll be the first to know.

18:05.538 --> 18:09.004
Good. I'm also borrowing backup
from rampart.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.671
I'd like you to take point.

18:10.838 --> 18:12.637
Is any of this
gonna be a problem?

18:12.804 --> 18:14.572
Not at all.

18:17.639 --> 18:20.271
Changing suppliers
benefits us how?

18:20.438 --> 18:22.637
Lower cost,
unlimited supply,

18:22.804 --> 18:25.604
highest-quality product
on the market.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.438
We've been
with the same wholesaler

18:27.605 --> 18:29.438
since before
you had a cowlick.

18:34.672 --> 18:37.305
This meth came
from pure Mexican ephedra,

18:37.472 --> 18:40.238
cooked up
in a state-of-the-art laboratory

18:40.405 --> 18:43.138
by a team
of PhD chemists.

18:43.305 --> 18:45.538
Clean
as a virgin's whistle hole.

18:45.705 --> 18:49.038
And a lot cheaper than the shit
that you're getting.

18:49.205 --> 18:52.705
You sure you want an undercut
on your price on the street?

18:54.904 --> 18:57.071
We pass.

18:57.238 --> 18:59.838
But you haven't even, uh,
sampled the blow.

19:00.005 --> 19:01.938
We got love for Beenie.

19:02.105 --> 19:04.737
Only took this meeting
as a courtesy to him.

19:04.904 --> 19:07.371
We got too much history
with our connect

19:07.538 --> 19:09.472
to just go astray
for some cop...

19:09.639 --> 19:12.405
a peckerwood cop at that.

19:15.438 --> 19:16.938
I lay out a proposal

19:17.105 --> 19:20.271
with enormous financial upside
to you people

19:20.438 --> 19:22.938
and you just dismiss it
out of hand?

19:24.538 --> 19:28.038
Why don't you take a look
outside that window?

19:28.205 --> 19:30.338
That's what's in your future.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.238
I asked my boss
for a little backup today.

19:34.405 --> 19:36.038
That's what he sent.

19:36.205 --> 19:39.971
Your spik boss wants
to throw down, bring it.

19:40.138 --> 19:43.405
'Cause I see two trucks eight
deep with Mexican gardeners.

19:43.572 --> 19:45.171
They hear a shot out there,

19:45.338 --> 19:47.405
there'll be an rpg
in this living room

19:47.572 --> 19:48.771
before I hit the floor.

19:48.938 --> 19:51.438
Put that shit away.

19:54.705 --> 19:57.405
Let me tell you
about the landscaping job

19:57.572 --> 19:58.971
those gardeners did.

19:59.138 --> 20:01.671
In rosarito beach, Mexico,
last year,

20:01.838 --> 20:05.438
them and a convoy of amigos
rolled up on a police station,

20:05.605 --> 20:07.572
murdered everyone inside.

20:07.739 --> 20:12.538
47 people...
cops, dispatchers, janitors.

20:12.705 --> 20:15.704
That was my, uh, spik boss' plan

20:15.871 --> 20:17.971
for gaining market share
in the area.

20:18.138 --> 20:21.271
Now, if they're willing to do
that to their own countrymen,

20:21.438 --> 20:22.971
imagine what
they're willing to do

20:23.138 --> 20:27.238
to a handful of, uh,
stubborn soul brothers.

20:30.472 --> 20:34.138
And you think I'm a peckerwood.

20:34.305 --> 20:38.505
This ain't no proposal.
This is a gank and grab.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.604
I'm just trying
to increase the peace

20:40.771 --> 20:44.671
and promote racial harmony
through economic opportunity.

20:44.838 --> 20:47.038
Buy-in's 200 large.

20:49.105 --> 20:51.691
I can wait if you need
to run to the atm.

20:58.238 --> 20:59.238
Jefe.

20:59.405 --> 21:01.000
Wrong way.

21:01.272 --> 21:03.044
Señor Beltran's
in the other direction.

21:03.338 --> 21:05.238
I'll catch up to you.
I got an errand to run.

21:05.405 --> 21:06.255
No, jefe.

21:06.572 --> 21:09.342
Our instructions are
to be your seguridad.

21:09.594 --> 21:11.438
We got to get the money back
to Beltran right now.

21:11.605 --> 21:12.553
He's waiting.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.055
Oh, shit.

21:14.372 --> 21:17.391
Uh, I'm gonna need
some gas...

21:17.643 --> 21:19.227
gasolina.

21:56.405 --> 21:57.372
Yeah?

21:57.539 --> 21:59.038
Code red...
third and alvarado.

21:59.205 --> 22:02.472
Gas station, men's room,
trash can... there's a package.

22:02.639 --> 22:03.804
You know what to do.

22:04.065 --> 22:05.537
Highest priority.

22:05.704 --> 22:08.192
Oh, you get your ass over here

22:08.444 --> 22:10.438
as fast as you can,
and I mean soon.

22:10.605 --> 22:12.971
All right, sweetheart,
daddy has to work late.

22:13.138 --> 22:15.105
I'll see you later, okay?
Love you.

22:16.704 --> 22:18.995
Kids are terrific, huh?
You got any?

22:19.247 --> 22:21.138
Sí. Cinco.

22:23.417 --> 22:24.709
Vanbro!

22:25.005 --> 22:27.604
Yo, docki, my man.
What's good?

22:27.771 --> 22:29.088
What's up, black?

22:29.405 --> 22:31.704
Hey, I heard what happened
to the strike team, man.

22:31.871 --> 22:33.738
I guess you must be
the last cat standing.

22:33.905 --> 22:35.219
Upright and breathing.

22:35.505 --> 22:37.005
You signify your own path,
you won't get caught up

22:37.172 --> 22:38.637
in other folks' bullshit
and tribulation.

22:38.804 --> 22:40.138
That's how I do.

22:40.305 --> 22:43.604
And look at me, standing strong
and doing the damn thing.

22:43.771 --> 22:46.738
But, vanbro, what is up with this? Huh?

22:47.024 --> 22:48.271
You used to have talent.

22:48.438 --> 22:51.235
Hey, that's nonrepresentational
art right there.

22:51.539 --> 22:53.696
It worked for basquiat.
It'll work for vanbro.

22:54.071 --> 22:55.938
Take it. Nah, nah. We
just want information.

22:56.105 --> 22:57.305
Suit yourself.

22:57.472 --> 22:58.671
What do you hear about
the Cardell Rhodes shooting?

22:58.838 --> 22:59.938
Rumor going around

23:00.105 --> 23:02.305
the cats making book
got pissed at youngblood

23:02.472 --> 23:04.874
for point-shaving against dorsey
the other night.

23:05.138 --> 23:06.771
Cardell was involved
in gambling?

23:06.938 --> 23:09.472
I mean, I wouldn't want to
speculate on that for certain,

23:09.639 --> 23:11.238
but little man
with all that speed

23:11.405 --> 23:13.504
stepping out of bounds
with all kinds of daylight

23:13.671 --> 23:15.537
numerous times?

23:15.704 --> 23:17.472
I mean, you got to wonder
about the spread.

23:17.639 --> 23:19.138
Where did you hear this?

23:19.305 --> 23:20.640
Fourth-hand knowledge.

23:20.892 --> 23:23.787
Don't really have
any specific names.

23:27.138 --> 23:28.971
You might want to check
with my man deuce

23:29.138 --> 23:30.983
down there on bronson,
next to the laundromat.

23:31.305 --> 23:34.445
Appreciate it, though, you keep
vanbro name out your mouth.

23:34.697 --> 23:36.539
Stay black.

23:40.405 --> 23:41.535
Detective Billings.

23:41.787 --> 23:42.787
Anything yet, Steve?

23:43.038 --> 23:44.971
Oh, shit. Right.
Uh, let me look.

23:49.505 --> 23:50.971
Deuce says
it wasn't point-shaving.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.038
Cardell's been playing it smart
all season...

23:53.205 --> 23:55.138
stepping out of bounds
to avoid cheap shots,

23:55.305 --> 23:56.778
saving his knees
for the next level.

23:57.030 --> 23:58.838
All the bookies making the line
knew that.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.346
They factored that
into the spread.

24:00.598 --> 24:01.681
No, no mail yet.

24:01.971 --> 24:03.326
Just keep an eye out,
okay?

24:04.804 --> 24:05.904
Let's head back to the Barn
and regroup.

24:06.071 --> 24:07.580
No, hey, I want to talk
to that recruiter again

24:07.832 --> 24:08.838
as soon as he gets back

24:09.005 --> 24:10.372
from scouting that kid
down in San diego.

24:10.539 --> 24:11.691
Polk's a victim, not a suspect. Exactly.

24:12.071 --> 24:13.401
Maybe he was the target.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.338
That's worth
a conversation.

24:15.505 --> 24:17.530
I got to go get
a prescription filled.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.639
I'll meet you
back there, okay?

24:29.604 --> 24:30.804
Hey, yo, my man!

24:33.305 --> 24:34.804
Hey, man, you goddamn deaf,
homey?

24:42.372 --> 24:43.764
What are you looking
to get into, gabacho?

24:44.038 --> 24:45.571
None of that goddamn
stepped-on shit.

24:45.738 --> 24:47.005
I ain't
seen you around before.

24:47.172 --> 24:48.686
Yeah, well,
I'm changing slangers, man.

24:48.938 --> 24:50.804
I'm looking to bring my business
to you.

24:50.971 --> 24:52.704
You want to get paid
or what, man?

24:52.871 --> 24:54.338
'Cause I'm looking
to get low.

24:54.505 --> 24:56.038
Let me see
what I'm working with.

25:00.804 --> 25:02.575
I'm gonna hold a dub, cuz.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.209
You ain't no cop!

25:12.472 --> 25:14.571
You need to work
on your street skills.

25:14.738 --> 25:17.938
Now, you're gonna walk me into
that stash house off normandie.

25:18.105 --> 25:20.038
I ain't doing shit for you.
I'm 16.

25:20.205 --> 25:22.005
Take me in,
and we'll call my moms.

25:22.263 --> 25:23.372
I don't have her number.

25:23.539 --> 25:25.056
Hey, bro, why you tripping?
Aah!

25:26.183 --> 25:27.405
I can do this shit all day.

25:27.685 --> 25:29.171
So, what's it gonna be?

25:29.338 --> 25:33.038
You doing what I tell you
or blood coming out your ears?

25:33.316 --> 25:36.336
How much firepower inside?

25:36.639 --> 25:38.360
Enough to shred
your bony, white ass.

25:38.639 --> 25:39.862
How much cash?
Huh?

25:40.172 --> 25:42.448
8 to 10.
Had a good couple of days.

25:42.738 --> 25:44.138
All right,
let's get this done.

25:51.542 --> 25:52.472
What the hell happened?

25:52.639 --> 25:53.838
Beats the shit out of me.

25:54.005 --> 25:55.704
It was up and slanging
two hours ago.

26:03.338 --> 26:04.948
You ain't a cop.
I was right.

26:05.238 --> 26:07.038
Yeah,
you're a goddamn genius.

26:18.738 --> 26:20.071
We got a runner!

26:22.539 --> 26:23.675
We got a runner!

26:23.991 --> 26:25.405
Hey, freeze!

26:25.572 --> 26:26.572
Police!

26:28.639 --> 26:31.905
100 grand...
earnest money.

26:34.854 --> 26:36.627
Don't smoke, don't drink.

26:37.004 --> 26:39.905
A man of few vices.

26:42.338 --> 26:44.237
For me,
it blurs the edge.

26:44.539 --> 26:48.238
The edge is where we live...
all of us, all the time.

26:48.405 --> 26:51.238
People try to convince
themselves otherwise,

26:51.405 --> 26:53.894
it's just an exercise
in self-deception.

26:54.172 --> 26:55.637
A philosopher.

26:55.804 --> 26:58.899
Former cop.
Same deal, less horseshit.

26:59.172 --> 27:01.205
Things come easy
for you, huh?

27:01.372 --> 27:02.945
Are you one of these

27:03.238 --> 27:05.508
"hard work
is its own reward" guys?

27:05.760 --> 27:07.671
I had grandparents
like that.

27:07.838 --> 27:09.702
They died miserable
and broke.

27:10.005 --> 27:13.504
You've accomplished a lot
in a very short time.

27:13.671 --> 27:17.585
You need to understand
something Pezuela never did...

27:17.838 --> 27:21.505
you got an action hero
on your payroll.

27:35.038 --> 27:36.804
Okay.

27:36.971 --> 27:39.208
She's in position.

27:39.483 --> 27:41.605
I've got a visual.

27:43.988 --> 27:46.947
Tell me she's gonna get through
this without cracking on us.

27:47.205 --> 27:49.537
I'd feel better if we could
communicate with her.

27:49.704 --> 27:51.005
The wire's risky enough.

27:51.172 --> 27:53.704
I don't want Mackey
sniffing anything.

28:00.338 --> 28:03.130
Ronnie's here.
Vic's not with him.

28:03.382 --> 28:04.438
It's Gardocki.

28:04.605 --> 28:06.926
What's he doing...
recon for Vic?

28:07.205 --> 28:08.947
Julien, you have a visual
on Mackey?

28:09.199 --> 28:10.971
Negative.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.325
Where's Vic?

28:12.600 --> 28:13.637
This is for you.

28:13.995 --> 28:16.060
Well, Vic was supposed
to be here. Is he all right?

28:16.338 --> 28:17.645
He's fine.
Something came up.

28:17.938 --> 28:19.372
Come on, Corrine,
get him talking.

28:19.539 --> 28:21.205
Is that what I'm supposed
to give Shane? Good girl.

28:21.372 --> 28:22.274
I got to go.
Thanks, Corrine.

28:22.539 --> 28:25.639
Ronnie as his goddamn
errand boy.

28:27.072 --> 28:28.049
Mackey's a no-show.

28:28.338 --> 28:30.074
On my signal, prepare
to apprehend Gardocki.

28:30.338 --> 28:31.704
No, no,
Mackey might be watching.

28:31.871 --> 28:32.938
You hold your positions

28:33.105 --> 28:34.745
until you've got a visual
on the primary.

28:35.038 --> 28:36.438
We've got Ronnie
dead to rights.

28:36.605 --> 28:38.938
We've got Gardocki on tape.
We can file on him later.

28:39.105 --> 28:40.668
We haven't got
the real bastard yet.

28:40.938 --> 28:44.637
Stand down.
Do not engage the target.

28:47.848 --> 28:49.481
Shane's an hour late.

28:50.148 --> 28:51.637
This doesn't feel right.

28:53.648 --> 28:55.799
Maybe Mara got cold feet,
spilled to Shane.

28:58.414 --> 29:00.347
Claudette,
they're not coming.

29:00.514 --> 29:02.564
What if Vic figured out
that I was working with you?

29:02.948 --> 29:04.775
That's why he sent Ronnie.

29:05.115 --> 29:06.948
Jesus Christ.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.781
Okay, she's losing it.

29:11.948 --> 29:14.114
Why didn't you give me something
so I could hear you?

29:14.281 --> 29:16.147
Somebody talk to me!

29:16.314 --> 29:17.981
Okay, call it.
Yeah.

29:18.148 --> 29:19.447
All units, abort.

29:19.614 --> 29:21.083
10-4. copy that.

29:21.448 --> 29:23.502
God damn it!

29:23.848 --> 29:26.182
So, now what?

29:28.082 --> 29:29.548
Bottom line...
we got to hunker down

29:29.715 --> 29:30.915
while they sweat the streets

29:31.082 --> 29:32.344
on account
of the president coming.

29:32.715 --> 29:33.814
You know, the real danger

29:34.066 --> 29:35.431
is that they know you think
like a cop,

29:35.815 --> 29:39.414
so they're expecting you
to hit certain targets.

29:39.581 --> 29:40.848
But they don't know
how I think.

29:41.015 --> 29:42.021
If you've got an idea on how
we can score some cash, baby,

29:42.472 --> 29:43.381
lay it on me.

29:43.548 --> 29:45.347
The safe
at the real-estate company.

29:45.514 --> 29:46.608
Come on.

29:46.981 --> 29:49.481
No, there's a lockbox where
the coordinator keeps checks

29:49.648 --> 29:51.047
before they send them
to escrow.

29:51.214 --> 29:54.247
Mara, if I can't
knock over a stash house,

29:54.414 --> 29:56.714
what makes you think
we're gonna walk into a bank

29:56.881 --> 29:58.381
and cash a bunch
of stolen checks

29:58.548 --> 30:00.347
made out to a goddamn
escrow company? Shh.

30:00.514 --> 30:02.714
They also keep the checks
for apartment rentals...

30:02.881 --> 30:04.881
first, last, security deposit. So?

30:05.048 --> 30:06.915
So, most of the time,
they're cashier's checks.

30:07.082 --> 30:09.414
Folks in the hood
don't have checking accounts.

30:09.581 --> 30:12.468
Well, I can pass
a cashier's check, no problem.

30:12.881 --> 30:14.897
But I don't know
about cracking in no safe.

30:15.149 --> 30:16.614
No, no,
I have the combination.

30:16.781 --> 30:17.915
I've been filling in
for the assistant manager

30:18.082 --> 30:19.114
out on maternity leave.

30:19.403 --> 30:21.134
So, I'll go in,
grab the checks, and go.

30:21.548 --> 30:23.047
Hmm?
No, it's too dangerous.

30:23.214 --> 30:24.938
The only people that'll be there
are the cleaning crew.

30:25.432 --> 30:26.614
You don't think they know you're a
fugitive already? And they know me.

30:26.781 --> 30:28.448
They're illiterate,
and they don't speak english.

30:31.815 --> 30:33.790
I'll go in.

30:34.042 --> 30:36.681
I don't want the mother
of this little girl

30:36.985 --> 30:39.648
in harm's way any more
than she already is.

30:44.915 --> 30:45.781
Ha!

30:45.948 --> 30:47.481
For a guy in a close race,

30:47.648 --> 30:49.963
you'd think you'd have
more pressing matters

30:50.381 --> 30:51.748
than to stalk me
for my vote.

30:51.915 --> 30:53.467
I've been looking
into the circumstances

30:53.881 --> 30:56.047
surrounding Pezuela's
"suicide."

30:56.398 --> 30:57.981
And here I thought
you'd miss the prick.

30:58.148 --> 31:00.681
Interesting fact surfaced when
I reached out to my contacts

31:00.848 --> 31:02.217
at the coroner's office.

31:02.581 --> 31:05.714
Cruz Pezuela ate a bullet
less than 24 hours ago,

31:05.981 --> 31:10.414
yet his body
is already back in Mexico.

31:10.581 --> 31:12.694
Why waste time
taking out the garbage?

31:13.048 --> 31:14.347
A suicide in L.A. County,

31:14.514 --> 31:16.814
the coroner's required
to perform an autopsy.

31:17.066 --> 31:18.614
But he never
had the chance.

31:18.781 --> 31:21.453
That's because
Pezuela isn't dead,

31:21.815 --> 31:23.648
is he?

31:24.051 --> 31:26.881
I got someplace to be.

31:27.048 --> 31:29.429
We can debate the eternal
qualities of the soul

31:29.681 --> 31:30.781
at another time.

31:30.948 --> 31:33.915
Is Pezuela testifying?
What's he saying about me?

31:34.082 --> 31:35.748
I played my cards.
You played yours.

31:35.915 --> 31:37.681
I took the pot.
I win.

31:37.848 --> 31:40.472
Now step away from the table.
Game over.

31:41.026 --> 31:43.180
No, I still have
one more card to play.

31:43.347 --> 31:44.481
I will go
straight to Beltran

31:44.648 --> 31:46.270
and tell him that Pezuela
is alive and testifying.

31:46.648 --> 31:48.281
I will wreck
this investigation

31:48.448 --> 31:50.514
before I let you and Olivia
cut me out.

31:50.681 --> 31:52.047
What makes you
more afraid...

31:52.214 --> 31:55.015
being denied your legacy
as the great Brown informer

31:55.182 --> 31:56.381
or it coming out

31:56.548 --> 31:58.740
that your campaign is financed
with dope money?

32:00.715 --> 32:03.281
We have a common cause.

32:05.314 --> 32:08.333
Are you asking me
to be your friend?

32:08.748 --> 32:12.314
I'm asking that we both
respect the other's end game.

32:16.314 --> 32:19.047
Hey, how goes it?
Fine.

32:19.214 --> 32:20.387
Claudette had you out
on something?

32:20.715 --> 32:21.681
Checking a lead.

32:21.848 --> 32:23.080
Something on Shane?

32:23.247 --> 32:24.975
Um, turned out
to be nothing.

32:30.314 --> 32:33.275
Hey.
Everything okay?

32:33.581 --> 32:36.614
Yeah. Yeah.

32:36.781 --> 32:39.689
Um, Polk's back from San diego.
I'm gonna go see him.

32:39.981 --> 32:41.481
You got that covered?

32:41.648 --> 32:43.314
Yep.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.422
Great.

32:53.115 --> 32:54.614
What about drugs?

32:54.781 --> 32:57.147
Our intel says
the cartel's a major supplier

32:57.314 --> 32:58.848
across the southwest.

32:59.015 --> 33:01.414
Beltran never mentioned
any drugs.

33:01.581 --> 33:03.414
This guy's all about banks.

33:03.798 --> 33:05.180
The scale of this thing...

33:05.347 --> 33:08.147
the infrastructure,
transportation, security...

33:08.314 --> 33:12.648
looks like they're planning
to wash half the Mexican gnp.

33:12.948 --> 33:14.015
Chaffe wants to find a way

33:14.182 --> 33:15.848
to embed a couple
of our agents with you.

33:16.015 --> 33:18.320
It's time for me to pull my guy
Ronnie Gardocki into this thing.

33:18.681 --> 33:19.404
We'd rather use someone
from our end.

33:19.981 --> 33:21.615
This isn't the time to play
"getting to know you."

33:21.981 --> 33:22.991
Ronnie and I
have a short hand.

33:23.281 --> 33:24.648
Also, I need Beltran to feel
like he's got reach

33:24.815 --> 33:25.494
into the local
police department.

33:25.848 --> 33:27.120
Vic, I can't say yes
to that.

33:27.481 --> 33:28.664
That's the way
it's got to be!

33:35.715 --> 33:37.923
Meanwhile, this is yours.

33:39.781 --> 33:43.178
Pezuela's blackmail file
on you.

33:43.671 --> 33:46.765
I just found it.

33:47.048 --> 33:49.881
If I'm honest...

33:50.261 --> 33:53.031
I was tempted
to hold onto it...

33:53.283 --> 33:54.814
pull an Aceveda,

33:54.981 --> 33:57.115
use it to squeeze you.

34:02.048 --> 34:03.865
Thank you.

34:07.247 --> 34:10.047
I just gave away any leverage
I ever had on you.

34:10.342 --> 34:12.246
Now I'm out of a job,

34:12.414 --> 34:14.158
and I'm cozying up

34:14.409 --> 34:17.380
to the most dangerous man
in the Mexican cartel.

34:17.547 --> 34:20.813
And even if I fool Beltran
long enough to stay alive,

34:20.981 --> 34:23.677
I've got no future
I can plan on past tomorrow.

34:26.014 --> 34:30.748
I need a place to land.
Can I count on you for that?

34:43.313 --> 34:45.364
Excuse me, mi amigo.
Hey, uh, mi amigo?

34:46.952 --> 34:49.347
¿qué?

34:49.672 --> 34:51.681
¿sí?

34:51.848 --> 34:53.040
Buenas noches.
Let's go... in the back.

34:53.414 --> 34:54.481
Silencio.
Silencio. Silencio.

34:54.648 --> 34:56.080
Silencio.
Shh. Be quiet. Be quiet.

34:56.246 --> 34:57.748
In the back. In the back.
Silencio.

34:59.048 --> 35:01.173
Hey, come on. Let's go.
Let's go, right there.

35:01.581 --> 35:02.591
Shh! Be quiet!
Shh!

35:02.948 --> 35:04.676
Be quiet! Be quiet!
Silencio!

35:04.981 --> 35:06.637
On the floor, damn it!
On the floor!

35:07.213 --> 35:08.889
Hit the deck, damn it,
right now. Down.

35:09.182 --> 35:10.766
Down.
Abajo. Abajo.

35:11.018 --> 35:12.684
God!

35:12.948 --> 35:14.811
All right.

35:15.115 --> 35:16.581
Right 32, left...

35:16.748 --> 35:18.190
hey, shut up!
I'm trying to think here!

35:19.948 --> 35:22.861
...27, right 60.

35:23.148 --> 35:24.655
Ahh.

35:25.106 --> 35:26.015
Okay.

35:26.182 --> 35:30.786
32 left, 27 right, 60.

35:31.082 --> 35:32.147
Shit.

35:32.314 --> 35:33.781
Okay, all right.

35:33.948 --> 35:36.750
Anyone moves, um, muerto.
Muerto.

35:40.214 --> 35:42.247
Mara, come on.

35:42.414 --> 35:43.674
I got...

35:44.015 --> 35:46.426
bring him.
Just bring him. Come on.

35:46.715 --> 35:48.419
Let's go! God!

35:48.805 --> 35:51.223
Hurry up!

35:52.392 --> 35:53.314
God.

35:53.481 --> 35:54.518
What?

35:54.781 --> 35:57.104
That goddamn safe.

36:01.314 --> 36:05.654
Okay, I dialed right 32,
left 27, right 16.

36:06.048 --> 36:07.814
You have to pass 27 twice,
remember?

36:07.981 --> 36:10.147
Stop on it the third time
and then right to 16.

36:10.314 --> 36:11.618
I don't know
what that means.

36:11.981 --> 36:13.514
Oh, God.
Here. Take him.

36:13.681 --> 36:14.663
Um, hey.

36:14.981 --> 36:16.514
Hey, Jackson,
be still, buddy.

36:16.681 --> 36:17.958
Can you just
be still, okay?

36:19.881 --> 36:21.514
Dámelo, por favor.
What?

36:21.681 --> 36:22.671
Dámelo.

36:25.926 --> 36:27.676
Hey.

36:33.514 --> 36:36.059
Okay, I got it.

36:36.414 --> 36:37.988
Gracias.
De nada.

36:41.182 --> 36:42.881
So?
How'd we do?

36:43.048 --> 36:44.915
$5,000, give or take.

36:45.082 --> 36:47.048
That'll work.

36:59.790 --> 37:01.723
Shane didn't show up
today?

37:01.890 --> 37:03.754
What happened?
I was worried.

37:04.057 --> 37:05.890
Job interview came up
at the last minute.

37:06.057 --> 37:06.990
I had no choice.

37:07.157 --> 37:08.008
Job interview?

37:08.423 --> 37:10.723
Yeah, a position opened up
with the feds.

37:10.890 --> 37:12.888
I really have a shot...
good benefits.

37:13.224 --> 37:15.423
Obviously,
we're gonna need it.

37:15.590 --> 37:18.890
Corrine, I am so sorry
I left you on the hook today.

37:19.057 --> 37:21.146
I did not want
to do that to you.

37:25.190 --> 37:28.523
We sure as hell would have heard
if Shane got popped.

37:28.690 --> 37:32.590
Anything happen at the park
that might have spooked him?

37:32.757 --> 37:34.990
No, just me
and the crackheads.

37:35.157 --> 37:38.356
Listen, please just get this
out of here, okay?

37:38.523 --> 37:40.023
It makes me nervous.

37:40.190 --> 37:42.389
Keep it.
Shane might call back.

37:42.556 --> 37:45.003
And if he doesn't,
use it for the kids.

37:45.356 --> 37:47.798
Where did this money
come from?

37:48.090 --> 37:50.690
All that matters now
is it's in good hands.

37:51.053 --> 37:52.886
Please tell me
when this is gonna be over.

37:53.138 --> 37:55.764
Soon.

37:56.023 --> 37:57.389
Hi, dad.

37:57.556 --> 37:59.017
Hey, kid.

37:59.289 --> 38:00.289
How are you?

38:00.456 --> 38:02.057
Cassidy, you need
to get to bed.

38:02.224 --> 38:03.814
You have an early morning
tomorrow.

38:04.157 --> 38:05.923
I just want to show dad
my math test.

38:06.090 --> 38:06.983
I got a 98%.

38:07.235 --> 38:10.590
You got a 98%.

38:10.757 --> 38:12.656
That's great, kid.

38:12.957 --> 38:15.890
You're really pulling it
together, aren't you?

38:16.057 --> 38:18.286
Thanks. I'm trying.

38:20.332 --> 38:21.248
Vic.

38:21.556 --> 38:24.876
What?
She earned it.

38:25.224 --> 38:27.057
Okay, dad.
Iove you.

38:27.224 --> 38:28.590
Iove you, too.

38:33.823 --> 38:36.057
I'll fax you a list of
all the I.a. Kids we've met with

38:36.224 --> 38:37.430
as soon as I get back
to dallas.

38:37.682 --> 38:39.356
That could be helpful.

38:39.523 --> 38:42.790
Just know that, usually,
a sit-down for me

38:42.957 --> 38:44.646
involves a coach,
overprotective mother,

38:44.957 --> 38:47.222
sometimes
a family minister.

38:47.389 --> 38:49.901
With Rhodes,
I had a meet-cute

38:50.289 --> 38:52.571
with some inked-out thug
in baggy clothes and a grill.

38:52.923 --> 38:54.556
Got me wondering
if offering him a scholarship

38:54.723 --> 38:55.615
was even a good idea.

38:55.990 --> 38:57.323
For all we know, that thug
could have been there

38:57.490 --> 38:58.623
as a show of respect
to Cardell...

38:58.790 --> 39:00.356
make sure he wasn't
taken advantage of.

39:00.523 --> 39:01.621
By who? Me?

39:01.990 --> 39:04.489
I walk into a place like this,
I'm Mr. Opportunity...

39:04.656 --> 39:05.723
money, education,

39:05.890 --> 39:07.556
chance to get out
of a shitty environment.

39:07.723 --> 39:08.879
That cuts both ways.

39:09.224 --> 39:11.890
In your job, you destroy more
dreams than you make come true.

39:12.057 --> 39:13.356
That earns you
some enemies.

39:13.523 --> 39:14.990
Tell me about it.

39:15.157 --> 39:17.723
Last year, I had a mother come
after me with a baseball Bat

39:17.890 --> 39:19.222
after we took a pass
on her kid.

39:19.389 --> 39:21.641
Same block as Cardell.

39:21.923 --> 39:23.602
How random's that?

39:25.556 --> 39:27.057
Thanks for bringing verna
down here.

39:27.224 --> 39:28.940
I didn't want her
coming down here by herself,

39:29.289 --> 39:31.156
picking up
her boy's things.

39:31.323 --> 39:33.122
Did they find
who did this?

39:33.289 --> 39:34.279
Um, not yet.

39:34.531 --> 39:36.222
Never found the gang member

39:36.389 --> 39:38.890
that murdered your son
last year, either.

39:40.890 --> 39:42.057
No, they didn't.

39:42.224 --> 39:45.081
You were at home at the time
of today's shooting?

39:45.423 --> 39:47.456
I was there watching my stories
on television.

39:47.623 --> 39:49.836
Did you hear shots?

39:50.124 --> 39:53.189
No, I, uh...
I heard the siren, though.

39:53.356 --> 39:55.556
And then my neighbor came
knocking on the door.

39:55.723 --> 39:56.843
If you care
about your friend,

39:57.224 --> 39:58.489
you'll help me
solve this case...

39:58.656 --> 39:59.763
save verna a lot of pain.

40:00.157 --> 40:02.356
All you got to do is
tell the truth. Of course.

40:02.523 --> 40:04.184
You knew darren Polk was
in that truck,

40:04.436 --> 40:06.311
didn't you?

40:06.656 --> 40:08.063
He the same man
that recruited your son?

40:11.923 --> 40:16.122
He promised dion a scholarship,
a car, money...

40:16.289 --> 40:18.073
all kinds of things.

40:18.389 --> 40:19.908
And then it just, what?
All falls through?

40:20.224 --> 40:24.023
Your son was shot and killed
a little while after that.

40:24.190 --> 40:27.749
Six months. Shot my baby
in the head at a bus stop.

40:28.057 --> 40:31.878
Mia, as a mother
who has lost a child,

40:32.224 --> 40:35.023
tell me that you didn't know
he was in that truck.

40:38.757 --> 40:40.490
With them dark windows...

40:43.656 --> 40:46.890
...I didn't...
I didn't see Cardell.

40:47.057 --> 40:48.323
And that's the truth.

40:48.490 --> 40:49.688
I didn't see Cardell.

40:49.990 --> 40:54.923
That man...
he destroyed my boy.

40:55.090 --> 40:56.723
And now he's lying
in the dirt

40:56.890 --> 40:58.947
when he should be running
for touchdowns.

41:23.265 --> 41:24.723
Shit.

41:26.556 --> 41:28.893
Hey, I was just about
to go upstairs and take...

41:29.145 --> 41:30.857
did you get it?

41:42.957 --> 41:45.389
Called I.A.D., got the paperwork
started on Gardocki.

41:45.556 --> 41:47.489
We'll be ready to hit him
with an indictment

41:47.656 --> 41:48.523
when the time comes.

41:48.690 --> 41:49.590
That's fine.

41:49.757 --> 41:51.207
Why don't you go home?

41:51.556 --> 41:53.251
Because I've got work
to do.

41:53.503 --> 41:57.256
I, uh, talked to Danny.

41:57.423 --> 41:58.556
Now that Vic's not
around here anymore,

41:58.723 --> 41:59.549
I think she's ready
to come back...

41:59.890 --> 42:01.957
help you take care
of things again.

42:03.423 --> 42:06.347
Seeing the bottom of my inbox
is not a priority.

42:06.599 --> 42:09.623
We'll get Vic.

42:09.790 --> 42:10.990
At the moment,

42:11.157 --> 42:13.813
I'm a little bit more concerned
about you.

42:14.157 --> 42:16.856
You know, we can't
expect justice out there

42:17.023 --> 42:19.623
when we don't demand it
in our own house.

42:19.790 --> 42:21.613
Okay, so,
now you're taking on

42:21.923 --> 42:24.189
the problems
of the whole world?

42:24.356 --> 42:26.659
Everything's not
under your control.

42:29.823 --> 42:32.723
You don't like the way
I'm handling this case,

42:32.890 --> 42:34.209
you can always leave.

42:44.057 --> 42:47.656
Olivia smelled Beltran's musk
on me... made her wet.

42:47.823 --> 42:48.765
We deliver,

42:49.157 --> 42:51.389
I.C.E. Is gonna take care
of both of us, I know it.

42:51.556 --> 42:53.590
If we close the deal
before Shane gets caught.

42:53.757 --> 42:55.756
He and Mara just
have to stay invisible

42:55.923 --> 42:57.122
for another day or two.

42:57.289 --> 42:58.690
What do you think of Shane

42:59.027 --> 43:00.990
taking a pass on that bag
of free money?

43:01.157 --> 43:02.823
He was just
giving us busywork...

43:02.990 --> 43:04.823
keeping it so we couldn't
look for him.

43:05.157 --> 43:08.389
Jesus,
this is cutting it close.

43:08.556 --> 43:10.489
Hey.

43:10.656 --> 43:12.580
A little ulcer
never hurt anyone.

43:14.790 --> 43:18.923
Say hello
to my friend Ronnie Gardocki.

43:19.090 --> 43:20.356
Mucho gusto.

43:20.523 --> 43:22.674
He speaks highly of your
character and your abilities.

43:23.023 --> 43:26.845
He taught me
everything I know.

43:29.432 --> 43:31.516
Boo-Ray.

43:31.768 --> 43:32.934
It's been a minute.

43:33.186 --> 43:34.923
How's the family doing?

43:35.090 --> 43:37.023
My peoples
is doing good.

43:37.190 --> 43:38.314
Glad to hear it.

43:38.623 --> 43:42.944
Iook, uh, I need your help
on a little business matter.

43:45.623 --> 43:47.489
I'm tapped out.
Come back another time.

43:47.656 --> 43:50.410
Oh, look, man, come on, you know
these are as good as cash.

43:50.757 --> 43:53.023
All the favors I did for you...
looking the other way

43:53.190 --> 43:55.373
while you ran your little
weed operation out the back.

43:55.723 --> 43:58.790
Come on.
You owe me, homey.

44:00.130 --> 44:02.755
I will make it up to you.

44:03.124 --> 44:04.623
You got yourself
in a spot.

44:04.790 --> 44:06.885
Yeah, don't believe
everything you hear.

44:11.757 --> 44:13.349
This is 2 grand light.

44:13.601 --> 44:14.809
50 cents on the dollar.

44:15.124 --> 44:17.353
That's a pretty steep vig.

44:17.605 --> 44:18.690
Iook, it's unacceptable.

44:18.857 --> 44:20.057
Give me 75 cents,
and we'll call it even.

44:20.224 --> 44:21.357
I got enough trouble.

44:21.723 --> 44:25.057
I got a kid. You know,
I got another one on the way.

44:25.224 --> 44:28.456
Walk away, white man,
or I dial 911.

44:28.623 --> 44:30.423
Put the phone down.
You're not a snitch, man.

44:30.590 --> 44:33.453
Giving up a killer cop
ain't snitching in my hood.

44:49.256 --> 44:50.553
It's the best I could do.

44:54.190 --> 44:57.723
Anyway, it's a down payment
on us getting out of here.

44:57.890 --> 45:00.856
I thought you said
this guy was your friend...

45:01.023 --> 45:04.224
that he owed you big-time.

45:08.490 --> 45:10.823
Baby, come here.

45:14.389 --> 45:15.856
Moving forward,

45:16.023 --> 45:18.590
I guess we both need
to embrace the reality

45:18.757 --> 45:20.667
that neither one of us
has a friend in the world...

45:22.823 --> 45:24.823
...except each other.

45:26.200 --> 45:29.100
