00:04.004 --> 00:06.277
(Meredith) WE'VE ALL HEARD
THE SAYING.

00:06.277 --> 00:08.179
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS

00:08.179 --> 00:11.182
WE LEARN IN SEVENTH GRADE
SCIENCE CLASS--ADAPT OR DIE.

00:11.182 --> 00:13.044

00:13.044 --> 00:14.645
(Cristina) IT'S TWO WORDS.

00:14.645 --> 00:16.647
NO... SEX.

00:16.647 --> 00:18.789
I'M SURE THERE SHOULD BE
MORE WORDS.

00:18.789 --> 00:21.422
IF YOU'RE GONNA CHOOSE
CHIEF RESIDENT,

00:21.422 --> 00:23.154
YOU HAVE TO BE IMPARTIAL.

00:23.154 --> 00:25.496
(grunts) COME ON.
THIS? NOW?

00:25.496 --> 00:27.658
SEX WITH ME,
HOWEVER HOT AND EXCELLENT,

00:27.658 --> 00:29.530
COULD CLOUD YOUR JUDGMENT.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.532
THIS IS BLACKMAIL
IS IT WHAT IT IS.

00:31.532 --> 00:34.135
NO, IT IS NOT.
FINAL INTERVIEWS ARE TODAY,

00:34.135 --> 00:36.807
AND COINCIDENTALLY,
I AM ON YOUR SERVICE.

00:36.807 --> 00:39.270
COINCIDENTALLY.
WELL, SINCE TEDDY'S
SHUTTING ME OUT OF CARDIO,

00:39.270 --> 00:42.543
WHERE I CAN SHOW MY STUFF,
I'M GONNA SHOW IT TO YOU.

00:42.543 --> 00:45.576
SO TODAY YOU'LL SEE ME NOT AS
YOUR NAKED AND DESIRABLE WIFE...

NO. NO, NO. NO CLOUDING.

MORE THAN IT HURTS YOU.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.690
NO, IT DOESN'T.

00:59.690 --> 01:02.233
I KNOW.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.366

OH, WATCH OUT.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.855

06:35.395 --> 06:37.668
WE WOULD JUST
HAVE TO SORT IT OUT.

06:37.668 --> 06:39.430

06:46.537 --> 06:49.540
YEAH, IF A UNIBROW WAS MY THING,
I'D BE ALL OVER THAT.

17-YEAR-OLD PREGNANT FEMALE

06:59.419 --> 07:02.422

(Miranda) LOOK, SHE'S GOT BLOOD
IN HER LEFT LOWER QUADRANT.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.856
COULD BE A SPLENIC RUPTURE,
BUT IT'S HARD TO TELL.
ABENA...

07:05.856 --> 07:08.529
ABENA'S FINE. DON'T WORRY
ABOUT HER RIGHT NOW.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.531
YOU NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT YOURSELF.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.063
YOU NEED TO HAVE SURGERY.
LEBO, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
YOU WERE PREGNANT?

07:13.063 --> 07:16.106
YOU WOULD'VE SAID I CANNOT FLY.
I HAD TO BE HERE FOR MY SISTER.

07:16.106 --> 07:18.709
IS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH MY BABY?

07:18.709 --> 07:20.841
I SEE A STRONG HEARTBEAT,
BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH FLUID

07:20.841 --> 07:22.543
SURROUNDING THE BABY,

07:22.543 --> 07:25.946
AND HE'S VERY SMALL
FOR 32 WEEKS.
SHE'S EIGHT MONTHS ALONG?

07:25.946 --> 07:29.680
YEAH, I'M GONNA NEED
TO MONITOR THIS BABY.
(Arizona) WELL, WE NEED
TO TAKE HER TO C.T. FIRST

07:29.680 --> 07:31.882
TO SEE WHERE THE ABDOMINAL
BLEEDING'S COMING FROM.
OKAY, I'LL MEET YOU
IN SURGERY.

07:31.882 --> 07:34.154
(monitor beeping erratically)
(Alex) SHE'S BARELY BREATHING.
I'LL GET AN AMBU.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.186
I'VE GOT BLOOD HANGING,
BUT HER B.P.'s STILL DROPPING.

07:36.186 --> 07:38.589
NO TIME FOR A C.T.
ALL RIGHT, CALL UP
AND GET AN O.R. READY.

07:38.589 --> 07:40.991
IT'S BASED ON
A PROTOCOL USED IN AVIATION.
MM-HMM.

07:40.991 --> 07:42.563
A SIMPLE CHECKLIST

07:42.563 --> 07:44.565
HAS LED TO A HUGE DROP
IN PLANE CRASHES.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.567
'CAUSE IT CUTS DOWN
ON HUMAN ERROR.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.569
EXACTLY, AND I THOUGHT
INSTEAD OF--
HERE YOU GO.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.571
THANKS--TELLING YOU
ABOUT IT IN AN INTERVIEW,

07:50.571 --> 07:52.573
I'D WALK YOU THROUGH IT.
MM-HMM.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.575
SO THE CHECKLIST
IS THE FIRST PAGE

07:54.575 --> 07:57.548
ON EVERY PATIENT CLIPBOARD
SO YOU CAN SEE AT A GLANCE

07:57.548 --> 08:00.751
THAT MR. ARANDA HAS BEEN CHECKED
IN FOR COUGHING UP BLOOD,

08:00.751 --> 08:02.913
HAS BEEN SEEN BY A PHYSICIAN,
HAS HAD A CHEST X-RAY,

08:02.913 --> 08:04.915
AND THOSE RESULTS
HAVE COME BACK,

08:04.915 --> 08:07.157
SO NOW WE JUST NEED TO GET
A CONSENT FOR BRONCHOSCOPY

08:07.157 --> 08:09.520
TO RULE OUT CANCER.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.491
CANCER?
HE MIGHT HAVE CANCER?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.263
LIKE GRANDPA HAD?

08:13.263 --> 08:16.166
HE DIED.
WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

08:16.166 --> 08:18.669
I'M SORRY. I-I SAID
"RULE OUT CANCER."

08:18.669 --> 08:20.500
THERE'S A SPOT ON YOUR X-RAY

08:20.500 --> 08:22.773
THAT WE JUST NEED TO TAKE
A CLOSER LOOK AT

08:22.773 --> 08:25.205
SO THAT WE CAN BE SURE
THAT YOUR DAD'S JUST FINE.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.277
JUST TO BE SURE, OKAY?

08:27.277 --> 08:30.681
OKAY. SO THAT'S, UH...
UPDATE THE PATIENT.

08:30.681 --> 08:32.683
DR. HUNT, BED SEVEN
IS ADMITTED FOR OBSERVATION,

08:32.683 --> 08:35.515
BED FIVE IS DISCHARGED,
I PUT IN A DRAIN IN BED NINE,

08:35.515 --> 08:37.517
AND I'M REPORTING
FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTION.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.650
YOU ARE ORGANIZED.

08:39.650 --> 08:41.091
AND FOCUSED AND EFFICIENT.

08:41.091 --> 08:43.754
OKAY. WELL, MR. ARANDA HERE
NEEDS TO GO UP TO BRONCHOSCOPY.

08:43.754 --> 08:46.056
WELL, I'LL TAKE HIM.
OH, ACTUALLY, NO.

08:46.056 --> 08:48.528
PROPER PROTOCOL
IS TO PAGE DR. ALTMAN.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.530
SHEWILL SCHEDULE
THE BRONCHOSCOPY.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.933
SEE? IT'S RIGHT HERE
ON THE CHECKLIST.
(taps clipboard)

08:52.933 --> 08:55.065
PROTOCOL.
OKAY, SO THE NEXT STEP

08:55.065 --> 08:58.208
IS THE O.R. CHECKLIST.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.910
(indistinct conversations)

08:59.910 --> 09:02.873
(clicks pen)

09:02.873 --> 09:06.046
MR. ARANDA, LET'S GET YOU
UP TO BRONCHOSCOPY.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.048
(Miranda) OH, THERE'S A LOT
OF BLEEDING HERE.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.950
UH, MORE SUCTION.
WHERE'S THE SOURCE?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.952
WELL, SO FAR THE SPLEEN
LOOKS GOOD.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.553
(suction gurgling)

09:13.553 --> 09:15.586
JUST KEEP EXPLORING.

09:15.586 --> 09:16.987
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

09:16.987 --> 09:20.030
UH, JUST A LITTLE MORE
RETRACTION THERE, PLEASE.

09:20.030 --> 09:21.762
(gasps)
(Alex) WHOA.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.994
UH--
WHAT'S HE DOING THERE?

09:23.994 --> 09:26.637
NOBODY MOVE. GOWN ME.
I'M GOING IN.

09:26.637 --> 09:29.069
UM, HOW DID HER BABY GET
TANGLED UP IN HER INTESTINES?

09:38.148 --> 09:40.751
RIGHT OVER HERE.
(Alex) THE BABY SURVIVED
A FULL TERM

09:40.751 --> 09:42.813
OUTSIDE OF THE UTERUS?
YEAH, IT'S EXTREMELY RARE.

09:42.813 --> 09:45.115
HER TUBES ARE SCARRED,
SO THE FERTILIZED EGG

09:45.115 --> 09:47.357
FOUND A PLACE TO IMPLANT
WHERE IT COULD CONTINUE TO GROW.

09:47.357 --> 09:49.790
DR. BAILEY, GRAB HIS FOOT WHILE
I FREE HIM FROM THESE ADHESIONS.

09:49.790 --> 09:52.192
WELL, WHY DIDN'T IT SHOW UP
ON THE ULTRASOUND?

09:52.192 --> 09:54.194
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IT'S MISSED
ABOUT 50% OF THE TIME.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.996
KEEP SUCTIONING.
OKAY, HE'S COMING OUT.

09:55.996 --> 09:59.099
CLAMPS TO DR. ROBBINS, PLEASE.
DR. KAREV, CUT THE CORD

09:59.099 --> 10:01.101
AND TAKE HIM TO GET CHECKED OUT.
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

10:01.101 --> 10:02.673
OKAY, THE BLOOD IN HER ABDOMEN

10:02.673 --> 10:05.035
IS FROM HER PLACENTA
RIPPING APART.

10:05.035 --> 10:08.038
WE NEED TO REMOVE
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

10:08.038 --> 10:10.981
BE PREPARED FOR TORRENTIAL
HEMORRHAGE. CHECK THE--
(monitor beeping erratically)

10:10.981 --> 10:13.714
(Miranda) PRESSURE'S DROPPING.
DAMN IT.
CLAMPS. ZERO VICRYL.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.886
WE GOTTA STOP THIS BLEEDING,
OR WE'RE GONNA LOSE HER.

10:15.886 --> 10:17.718
CROSSMATCH SIX MORE UNITS
OF R.B.C.s

10:17.718 --> 10:20.190
AND GET THEM UP HERE, STAT.
ALEX, I DON'T HEAR THAT BABY.

10:20.190 --> 10:22.753
COME ON, BUDDY.
GIVE IT UP.
(beeping continues)

10:22.753 --> 10:25.756
(baby crying)

10:25.756 --> 10:29.129
(beeping continues)

10:29.129 --> 10:32.262
(crying continues)

10:32.262 --> 10:34.264
AND I'VE BEEN DOING
SOME RESEARCH ON DIABETES,

10:34.264 --> 10:36.266
AND I HEARD YOU'RE STARTING
A CLINICAL TRIAL.

10:36.266 --> 10:38.268
I-I'D LIKE TO SEE
IF I COULD GET ON IT.

10:38.268 --> 10:40.270
WELL, THE TRIAL HAS
VERY SPECIFIC CRITERIA.

10:40.270 --> 10:42.272
I MEAN, THE SUBJECTS
HAVE TO REMAIN IMPARTIAL.

10:42.272 --> 10:45.175
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE MARRIED
TO ONE OF MY ATTENDINGS--

10:45.175 --> 10:47.177
LOOK, I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE
NEVER BEEN WILD

10:47.177 --> 10:49.179
ABOUT THE FACT
THAT TEDDY MARRIED ME,

10:49.179 --> 10:52.022
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
I REALLY LIKE HER...

10:52.022 --> 10:54.024
AND NOT
JUST FOR HER INSURANCE.

10:54.024 --> 10:56.026
BUT SHE STILL SEES ME
AS A PATIENT,

10:56.026 --> 10:58.288
AS A--AS AN INSURANCE SPONGE.

10:58.288 --> 11:00.991
I NEED TO GET
MY OWN INSURANCE,

11:00.991 --> 11:02.993
SO IN ORDER TO DO THAT
I NEED A JOB,

11:02.993 --> 11:05.395
AND IN ORDER TO GET A JOB,
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL

11:05.395 --> 11:08.668
IF I WASN'T GOING INTO DIABETIC
SHOCK EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.270
(elevator bell dings)

11:10.270 --> 11:12.002
HEY, UM, WHAT'S THIS?

11:12.002 --> 11:13.403
JUST A...
(speaks indistinctly)
OH.

11:13.403 --> 11:15.746
HEY.
HUNT. UH, MY KNEE REPLACEMENT
GOT CANCELED,

11:15.746 --> 11:17.748
AND I NEED TO BREAK
SOME BONES.

11:17.748 --> 11:19.750
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO
MEND THEM?

11:19.750 --> 11:22.152
WELL, IT'S MY FIRST DAY BACK,
AND I LEFT MY BABY

11:22.152 --> 11:23.754
FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE WE GOT HOME.

11:23.754 --> 11:26.156
I NEED TO REMEMBER WHY I LOVE
BEING A SURGEON SO MUCH

11:26.156 --> 11:28.759
OR I'M AFRAID I WILL WALK OUT
OF HERE AND NEVER COME BACK.

11:28.759 --> 11:30.761
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BIG.

11:30.761 --> 11:33.163
JUST A SPRAINED ANKLE,
HAIRLINE FRACTURE, ANYTHING.
(baby crying)

11:33.163 --> 11:35.766
OKAY.
OH, MY GOD. (laughs)
ANYTIME I HEAR A BABY CRY,

11:35.766 --> 11:37.768
IT MAKES ME THINK OF SOFIA.
(sighs)

11:37.768 --> 11:41.471
THEY ALL SOUND LIKE HER. WAIT.
THAT REALLY SOUNDS LIKE HER.

11:41.471 --> 11:44.334
(gasps) WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:44.334 --> 11:46.336
IT'S BRING YOUR DAUGHTER
TO WORK DAY.

11:46.336 --> 11:47.938
NO, IT'S NOT.

11:47.938 --> 11:50.080
I BATHED HER, CHANGED HER.
I FED HER, I NAPPED HER.

11:50.080 --> 11:52.242
HI.
WE READ A BOOK,

11:52.242 --> 11:54.444
PLAYED WITH THAT LITTLE
HANGING, JINGLING THING...

11:54.444 --> 11:56.116
WOW.

11:56.116 --> 11:59.119
AND IT WAS STILL ONLY 11:30.
I NEEDED SOME ADULT CONTACT.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.991
UH-HUH.

12:00.991 --> 12:03.393
PLEASE TAKE THIS BABY
AWAY FROM ME.

12:03.393 --> 12:05.856
SURE.
I'M SERIOUS. TAKE HER, MARK.

12:05.856 --> 12:07.257
OKAY.

12:07.257 --> 12:09.860
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.
THIS BABY'S CRACK.

12:09.860 --> 12:12.732
(baby talk voice)
SHE'S A CRACK BABY.
YOU SHOULDN'T CALL HER THAT.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.735
TORRES. YOU'RE IN LUCK.
MOTORCYCLE CRASH 20 MINUTES OUT.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.737
(normal voice) YES. OKAY.

12:17.737 --> 12:21.441
(whiny voice) OH, I LOVE YOU,
BUT MOMMY'S GOTTA GO TO WORK.

12:21.441 --> 12:24.044
(normal voice) TAKE HER, MARK.
GIVE ME THE BABY.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.076
JUST PHYSICALLY LIFT HER
FROM MY ARMS.

12:26.076 --> 12:27.217
OKAY.

12:27.217 --> 12:29.219
(whispers) OH, BYE.

12:29.219 --> 12:30.821
(cries)
OH, NO.

12:30.821 --> 12:33.353
OH, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.
OKAY. I'LL BE RIGHT--

12:33.353 --> 12:36.056
BACK--BACK YOU GO.
(makes chewing sound)
OKAY. (clears throat)

12:36.056 --> 12:38.058
(Arizona)
LEBO'S BOWEL LOOKS CLEAN.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.030
WE GOT ALL THE ADHESIONS.

12:40.030 --> 12:42.192
HOW'S THE BABY?

12:42.192 --> 12:44.194
GOOD. APGAR SCORE'S
9 AND 10.

12:44.194 --> 12:46.066
HOW'S SHE DOING?

12:46.066 --> 12:48.238
WE GOT THE BLEEDING
UNDER CONTROL

12:48.238 --> 12:50.971
AND REMOVED THE PLACENTA,
AND WE'RE ABOUT TO CLOSE.
SHE'S GONNA BE JUST FINE.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.372
YEAH, FOR NOW.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.044
SHE'S GONNA GO BACK THERE.

12:54.044 --> 12:56.176
SHE WON'T GET THE FOLLOW-UP CARE
THAT SHE NEEDS.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.849
ONCE SHE AND HER SISTER RUN OUT
OF THE SICKLE CELL MEDS

12:58.849 --> 13:01.852
WE GAVE THEM,
THEN WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO?
THE BEST THEY CAN.

13:01.852 --> 13:04.314
WHAT ABOUT THE KID?
HE'S PROBABLY A SICKLER, TOO.

13:04.314 --> 13:07.017
WHO'S GONNA GIVE HIM
HIS VACCINATION?
WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU, KAREV?

13:07.017 --> 13:08.158
WHAT?

13:08.158 --> 13:09.259
YOU.

13:09.259 --> 13:11.221
GO THERE.
GO BACK WITH THEM.

13:11.221 --> 13:13.864
THE JOB AT NAMBOZE CLINIC
HAS NEVER BEEN FILLED.

13:13.864 --> 13:15.866
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S SINGLE, UNATTACHED,

13:15.866 --> 13:17.227
WITH MINIMUM THREE YEARS
RESIDENCY.

13:17.227 --> 13:19.229
THERE'S A MED SCHOOL LOAN
FORGIVENESS GRANT

13:19.229 --> 13:22.472
ATTACHED TO IT. THEY'VE ALREADY
BEEN COORDINATING WITH YOU.

13:22.472 --> 13:26.076
I MEAN, THEY KNOW YOU.
YOU'RE KIND OF PERFECT.
WELL, THAT'S PRETTY FAR TO GO
FOR A FOLLOW-UP EXAM.

13:26.076 --> 13:29.179
YOU'D BE GREAT. I COULD
TAKE CARE OF IT WITH ONE CALL.

13:29.179 --> 13:31.341
SO YOU JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

13:33.383 --> 13:35.585
(indistinct conversations)

13:35.585 --> 13:37.817
(clears throat) SIR.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.921
OH, AVERY. UH, THAT CHART
OVER THERE--HENRY BURTON--

13:40.921 --> 13:42.322
NEEDS TO BE SCREENED.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.325
IF HE MEETS THE CRITERIA,
PUT HIM IN LINE FOR PHASE 1.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.057
CHIEF, I, UM, I'M SORRY.

13:47.057 --> 13:50.560
I NEED TO STEP AWAY
FROM THE TRIAL.

13:50.560 --> 13:53.103
YOU WHAT?

13:53.103 --> 13:55.835
I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY,
I DO, AND I DON'T WANT

13:55.835 --> 13:58.838
TO INCONVENIENCE YOU
GOING FORWARD--
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT ME.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.841
YOU WERE A BIG PART OF GETTING
THIS THING WHERE IT IS.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.844
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU WANT TO GIVE IT UP.
WELL, THAT'S VERY NICE
OF YOU TO SAY, SIR.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.847
BUT I FEEL LIKE I NEED
TO FOCUS ON SURGERY RIGHT NOW.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.220
YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

14:10.220 --> 14:12.522
RESPECTFULLY, YES.

14:12.522 --> 14:15.125
I AM.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.887
THANK YOU, SIR.

14:22.132 --> 14:23.533
(inhales deeply)

14:23.533 --> 14:26.897
(blows air)

14:26.897 --> 14:28.438
EXCELLENT WORK, DR. KAREV.

14:28.438 --> 14:31.041
GREY, JUST GIVE ME
TWO SECONDS.

14:31.041 --> 14:32.542
OKAY.

14:32.542 --> 14:34.444
(door closes)

14:34.444 --> 14:36.176
NO, I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

14:36.176 --> 14:39.179
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD
IF YOU'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT IT,

14:39.179 --> 14:41.281
BEFORE SOMEBODY FINDS OUT.

14:41.281 --> 14:44.284
NO ONE IS GOING TO.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.885
(door opens)

14:45.885 --> 14:48.388
GREY. READY?

14:48.388 --> 14:49.559
YEAH.

14:49.559 --> 14:51.661
OKAY, THERE IT IS.

14:51.661 --> 14:53.663
IT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE A TUMOR.

14:53.663 --> 14:55.265
IT LOOKS LIKE...

14:55.265 --> 14:58.168
WAIT. WHAT IS THAT?

14:58.168 --> 15:00.971
I'M GONNA COME AT IT
FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE.

15:00.971 --> 15:02.672
THERE. THAT'S BETTER.

15:02.672 --> 15:05.475
I JUST NEED TO GET
A LITTLE CLOSER.

15:05.475 --> 15:07.077
OH, MY GOD.

15:07.077 --> 15:09.409
WAIT. IS THAT...

15:09.409 --> 15:11.681
IS THAT A--
IS IT?

15:11.681 --> 15:13.984
YES.

15:13.984 --> 15:16.086
SHOULD WE CALL DR. ALTMAN?

15:16.086 --> 15:18.318
NO.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.250
NO.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.701
(beeps)

15:31.701 --> 15:34.634
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
YOU DON'T HAVE A TUMOR.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.707
YOU HAVE A TREE
GROWING IN YOUR LUNG.

15:37.707 --> 15:39.709
MY HUSBAND HAS A WHAT?

15:39.709 --> 15:41.511
A-A TREE.

15:41.511 --> 15:43.513
YOU COULD HAVE, UH,
INHALED A SEEDLING

15:43.513 --> 15:46.246
AND SOMEHOW, IT TOOK ROOT
AND STARTED GROWING IN THERE.

15:46.246 --> 15:49.119
WE WERE, UM,
TRIMMING OUR TREES

15:49.119 --> 15:50.650
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO,

15:50.650 --> 15:53.023
AND--AND STUFF WAS FLYING
AROUND, BUT--

15:53.023 --> 15:54.424
BUT--BUT HOW CAN IT GROW?

15:54.424 --> 15:56.586
THERE'S--THERE'S NO LIGHT,
THERE'S NO SOIL.

15:56.586 --> 15:59.359
I-IT HAPPENS.
SOMEHOW, IT JUST ADAPTED.
(elevator bell dings)

15:59.359 --> 16:01.561
SO MY DAD
DOESN'T HAVE CANCER?

16:01.561 --> 16:04.564
NO, HE DOESN'T. UH, BUT HE'LL
NEED A LITTLE SURGERY,

16:04.564 --> 16:07.697
AND THEN HE'LL BE FINE.
DR. YANG, CAN I PLEASE
SEE YOU IN THE HALL?

16:07.697 --> 16:09.439
MY DAD DOESN'T HAVE CANCER.

16:09.439 --> 16:11.441
THAT'S GREAT.

16:11.441 --> 16:13.973
UM, TO BE CLEAR,
I NEVER SAID HE HAD CANCER.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.506
YOU WERE WRONG.
YOU'RE A BAD DOCTOR.

16:16.506 --> 16:18.248
(woman) SHH. HEY.
COME ON.

16:18.248 --> 16:21.351
DR. YANG,
ONE MINUTE, PLEASE.

16:21.351 --> 16:24.514
I'LL BE BACK.

16:24.514 --> 16:26.386
(indistinct conversations)

16:26.386 --> 16:28.388
YOU FALSIFIED HIS CHECKLIST.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.660
I STREAMLINED IT, AND I FOUND
A TREE IN HIS LUNG.

16:30.660 --> 16:33.723
YOU NEVER PAGED DR. ALTMAN.
YOU JUST HIJACKED THIS PATIENT.

16:33.723 --> 16:36.396
A TREE,APRIL. A CONIFER.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.628
THAT'S...
(elevator bell dings)

16:38.628 --> 16:40.770
WELL, THAT'S...
MM-HMM.

16:40.770 --> 16:44.003
WELL, DID--DID YOU...
DID YOU TELL DR. ALTMAN?

16:44.003 --> 16:46.005
NO. I FOUND IT.
HE'S MY PATIENT.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.608
AND I'M GONNA
TAKE IT OUT MYSELF.
YOU'RE WHAT?

16:48.608 --> 16:50.610
IT'S A BIOPSY--
LIKE A GLORIFIED LUNG BIOPSY.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.612
OTHERWISE KNOWN
AS A THOROCOTOMY, WHICH IS

16:52.612 --> 16:55.014
A PROCEDURE THAT NEEDS TO BE
SUPERVISED BY AN ATTENDING--

16:55.014 --> 16:57.016
ONE LITTLE BREACH
IN PROTOCOL WON'T--

16:57.016 --> 16:59.419
OH!SO YOU DO ADMIT IT WAS
A BREACH OF PROTOCOL?

16:59.419 --> 17:01.451
APRIL, IF YOU DO THIS WITH ME,

17:01.451 --> 17:05.295
I WILL PUT IN A GOOD WORD
FOR YOU WITH OWEN.

17:05.295 --> 17:06.726

17:15.034 --> 17:18.037
(woman speaks indistinctly

17:18.037 --> 17:21.771
GOT YOUR C.T. AND BLOOD WORK,
REVIEWED YOUR FILES.

17:21.771 --> 17:23.313
YES, AND?

17:23.313 --> 17:25.645
AND IT LOOKS LIKE MEDICALLY,
YOU'RE A CANDIDATE.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.448
BUT, UH, I STILL HAVE
SOME RESERVATIONS.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.450
OH, DR. WEBBER.

17:30.450 --> 17:33.323
ANDREW PERKINS.
WELL, THIS IS A SURPRISE.

17:33.323 --> 17:35.225
HOPE YOU'RE NOT HERE
ON BUSINESS.

17:35.225 --> 17:38.228

OH, THE V.H.L. GUY
WITH, UH, DIABETES?

17:48.398 --> 17:51.201
AMONG OTHER THINGS,
YES. H-HENRY BURTON.
UH, SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN--

17:51.201 --> 17:53.673
NO, IT'S FINE. I AM--
I'M TEDDY'S FRIEND,

17:53.673 --> 17:55.805

WITH DIABETES.

17:55.805 --> 17:58.348
BUT HOPEFULLY, NOT FOR LONG.
(elevator bell dings)

17:58.348 --> 18:00.650
HENRY'S GONNA BE
ON MY CLINICAL TRIAL.

18:00.650 --> 18:03.783
THAT'S--THAT'S GREAT.
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT.

18:03.783 --> 18:07.357
WELL, I DON'T LIKE
TO BRAG, SO...

18:07.357 --> 18:09.359
SO SHOULD WE GET TO LUNCH?

18:09.359 --> 18:12.122
YEAH. YEAH, SURE.
UM, CONGRATULATIONS.

FOR THE UNDERDOG.

18:27.177 --> 18:28.708
HE IS A HANDSOME MAN.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.681

FOREMOST TRAUMA COUNSELORS.

KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR.

18:59.409 --> 19:01.441

A REASON TO STAY,

23:50.429 --> 23:52.431

YOU HAVE A HISTORY OF QUITTING

29:14.884 --> 29:16.425
NICE WORK.

29:16.425 --> 29:19.829
SO YOU GONNA DO IT--
AFRICA?

29:19.829 --> 29:22.191
HONESTLY, I'M NOT SURE.

29:22.191 --> 29:24.794

30:03.202 --> 30:05.474
YOU SAW HOW GOOD THIS BABY
LOOKED ON ME,

30:05.474 --> 30:07.937
SO YOU HAD TO GO GET ONE

30:07.937 --> 30:09.939
(laughs) EVERYTHING'S
A COMPETITION WITH YOU.

30:09.939 --> 30:11.480
HOW'D HER SURGERY GO?

30:11.480 --> 30:14.383
ROBBINS SAID SHE'S FINE.
SHE'S FEEDING AGAIN.

30:14.383 --> 30:18.247
GOOD, BECAUSE SOFIA CAN'T WAIT
TO HAVE A NEW FRIEND.

30:18.247 --> 30:21.050
(baby talk voice)
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, SOFIA?

30:21.050 --> 30:24.053
YOU AND ZOLA ARE GONNA BE
BEST FRIENDS. ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

30:24.053 --> 30:26.055
(normal voice)
OH, YOU JUST WAIT.

30:26.055 --> 30:29.058
THIS CRAP WILL BE COMING OUT
OF YOUR MOUTH, TOO.
(laughs) WELL, LET'S HOPE SO.

30:29.058 --> 30:31.060

WE'RE DEALING WITH

30:31.060 --> 30:32.962

ADOPTION TREATIES,

30:32.962 --> 30:35.604

30:35.604 --> 30:37.606
USUALLY GIVE
THOSE THINGS OUT.

30:37.606 --> 30:41.570
WELL, YOU'RE... BOTH SURGEONS,
YOU'D MAKE GOOD PARENTS.

30:41.570 --> 30:43.372
THEY'RE GONNA SEE THAT.

30:43.372 --> 30:45.844
WE'D BE NAIVE
TO GET AHEAD OF OURSELVES.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.246
YOU'RE DEREK SHEPHERD.

30:47.246 --> 30:49.979
THERE'S A REASON I'VE BEEN
JEALOUS OF YOU MY WHOLE LIFE,

30:49.979 --> 30:51.981
AND IT'S NOT YOUR HAIR.

30:51.981 --> 30:55.154
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
EVEN SOFIA KNOWS THAT.

30:55.154 --> 30:57.156
(baby talk voice)
RIGHT, SOFIA? SAY HI...

30:57.156 --> 30:58.888
(laughs)
UNCLE DEREK.

30:58.888 --> 31:01.490
THAT'S ZOLA'S DADDY.
YES, HE IS, RIGHT?

31:01.490 --> 31:03.993
OHH.

31:03.993 --> 31:05.995
(normal voice)
I'M GONNA GO FEED HER.

31:05.995 --> 31:07.866
MM-HMM.

31:07.866 --> 31:11.000
SO I SEE HERE THAT YOUR MOTHER
WAS A SURGEON.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.072
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

31:13.072 --> 31:15.604
UH, WELL, BEING RAISED
BY A SURGEON,

31:15.604 --> 31:19.548
YOU DEFINITELY... GET TO BE
VERY INDEPENDENT.

31:19.548 --> 31:21.880
UM, AND--

31:21.880 --> 31:24.283
NOT THAT I WOULD RAISE ZOLA

31:24.283 --> 31:26.285
THE WAY THAT
MY MOTHER RAISED ME.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.157
I, UH...

31:28.157 --> 31:31.260
SHE... DIDN'T BAKE.

31:31.260 --> 31:34.663
SHE WASN'T A BAKE SALE MOM,

31:34.663 --> 31:38.167
AND I... PLAN ON BAKING
ALL THE TIME.

31:38.167 --> 31:41.370
HOW ABOUT YOU TELL ME
ABOUT ZOLA?

31:41.370 --> 31:45.274
WELL, ZOLA HAD, UH,
ALREADY HAD A SHUNT

31:45.274 --> 31:47.606
AND SPINA BIFIDA SURGERY,

31:47.606 --> 31:50.079
AND THEN WE REALIZED
SHE HAD THIS HERNIA.

31:50.079 --> 31:51.910
AND TODAY IN HER SURGERY,

31:51.910 --> 31:54.643
IT LOOKED LIKE SHE MIGHT GO
INTO S.V.T.

31:54.643 --> 31:56.645
AND JUST
AS THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST

31:56.645 --> 31:59.048
WAS ABOUT TO PUSH
THE ADENOSINE,

31:59.048 --> 32:02.091
IT'S LIKE SHE KNEW TO STOP,

32:02.091 --> 32:04.493
AND HER HEART JUST SLOWED DOWN
ALL BY ITSELF,

32:04.493 --> 32:07.096
AND SHE WENT INTO SINUS.

32:07.096 --> 32:09.398
(inhales deeply)

32:09.398 --> 32:12.401
I-I'M SORRY. THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU ASKED ME, RIGHT?

32:12.401 --> 32:15.404
I... YOU WANT ME TO TALK ABOUT
HOW CUTE AND SWEET SHE IS,

32:15.404 --> 32:18.307
AND SHE IS VERY CUTE
AND SWEET,

32:18.307 --> 32:20.339
AND I...

32:20.339 --> 32:24.413
SHE--I'M NOT DOING VERY WELL,
AM I?

32:24.413 --> 32:26.945
I DON'T HAVE AN AGENDA HERE,
DR. GREY.

32:26.945 --> 32:30.349
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
A SENSE OF WHO YOU ARE.

32:30.349 --> 32:33.322
(sighs) I'M A SURGEON.

32:33.322 --> 32:36.485
AND, UH, I'M A GOOD SURGEON.

32:36.485 --> 32:38.487
AND I WANT TO BE
A GOOD MOTHER.

32:38.487 --> 32:41.660
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT IT.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.663
BUT I AM READY TO LEARN,

32:44.663 --> 32:46.695
AND I'M A FAST LEARNER.

32:46.695 --> 32:50.339
AND I WILL DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES

32:50.339 --> 32:52.671
TO BE A GOOD MOM.

32:54.373 --> 32:56.445
YOU KNOW WHAT GOOD MOMS DO?

32:56.445 --> 32:58.977
THEY BRAG ABOUT THEIR BABIES,

32:58.977 --> 33:00.979
AND THAT'S
WHAT I HEARD TODAY.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.512
AS IT TURNS OUT, ZOLA'S DAY
DIDN'T INVOLVE PLAYGROUP

33:03.512 --> 33:05.654
OR BABY GYM CLASS.

33:05.654 --> 33:07.986
IT INVOLVED SURGERY,

33:07.986 --> 33:10.459
AND YOU KNEW WHERE SHE WAS
EVERY SECOND.

33:10.459 --> 33:13.592
I APPRECIATE YOU
SHARING THAT WITH ME.

33:13.592 --> 33:16.595

33:19.598 --> 33:21.600

33:21.600 --> 33:23.602

I WAS SHOWING INITIATIVE.

33:23.602 --> 33:25.604
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU GET TO PRETEND

33:25.604 --> 33:27.336
THAT YOU'RE AN ATTENDING!

33:27.336 --> 33:29.678
I WASN'T PRETENDING, I JUST
DIDN'T NEED AN ATTENDING.
OH, MY GOD--

33:29.678 --> 33:31.680
TEDDY IS DOING A DISSERVICE
TO ME

33:31.680 --> 33:34.143
AND TO THE EDUCATION
THAT I DESERVE.

33:34.143 --> 33:36.785
I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO TAKE
MY LEARNING INTO MY OWN HANDS.

33:36.785 --> 33:38.617
SO I TOOK THE INITIATIVE
AND TREATED A PATIENT

33:38.617 --> 33:40.619

TO A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME.
