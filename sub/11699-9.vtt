00:01.758 --> 00:03.035
Philip.

00:03.036 --> 00:04.908
Don't you just love the way it sounds?

00:04.909 --> 00:06.010
Philip!

00:07.376 --> 00:09.563
And how adorable is that accent?

00:10.380 --> 00:13.513
But to be honest, I only understand
half of what he says.

00:15.123 --> 00:17.462
Where's Danny? Has he seen this?

00:17.463 --> 00:19.396
No, but have you seen this?

00:19.397 --> 00:21.890
Meet the Rangers' newest icegirl.

00:21.891 --> 00:23.108
<i>Ben: Oh, ho ho!</i>

00:23.109 --> 00:24.801
She's got her hands up
high, her feet down low,

00:24.802 --> 00:26.293
and that's the
way she jig-a-lo... 

00:26.294 --> 00:27.914
jig-a-lo
jig-a-lo!

00:27.915 --> 00:29.107
Jig-a-lo!

00:31.772 --> 00:33.435
Um, maybe it's just me.

00:33.436 --> 00:35.302
But isn't dressing Emma
up like a cheerleader

00:35.303 --> 00:36.935
just a little sexist?

00:36.936 --> 00:38.326
No, it's not just you.

00:39.219 --> 00:41.398
It's all the unpopular girls
who couldn't make cheerleading.

00:42.955 --> 00:45.307
Danny, take a look at this.

00:45.308 --> 00:47.271
Front page of the sports section.

00:47.272 --> 00:49.516
That Logan Parker is at it again.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.156
(Exhales) That dude hates me.

00:51.157 --> 00:53.021
He even criticized my Jersey.

00:53.022 --> 00:55.628
- We all wear the same ones!
- Yeah. Jerk!

00:56.105 --> 00:57.708
Well, we need him to start writing words

00:57.709 --> 01:00.215
like "awesome," "amazing,"
and "spectacular."

01:00.216 --> 01:02.470
Or the next contract
we negotiate is gonna be

01:02.471 --> 01:05.126
for you to sell shoes at
the big and tall store.

01:06.168 --> 01:07.705
What am I supposed to do about it?

01:07.706 --> 01:10.118
Here's a crazy idea. Play better?

01:10.936 --> 01:13.794
Come on! We need real ideas!

01:14.731 --> 01:16.752
Huh. Okay, you know what?

01:16.753 --> 01:18.130
Here's what we're gonna do.

01:18.131 --> 01:20.632
After practice today, we are gonna find him

01:20.633 --> 01:22.798
and we are gonna schmooze him.

01:22.799 --> 01:24.254
Okay? We just have to stop by my house

01:24.255 --> 01:25.606
and grab my cleavage. Okay? Let's go.

01:25.607 --> 01:26.941
Let's go. Come on.

01:28.450 --> 01:29.896
So, uh... 

01:29.897 --> 01:32.204
I was thinking of bringing
Philip to Danny's game tomorrow.

01:32.205 --> 01:33.369
Oh, my God!

01:33.950 --> 01:36.094
Can we please go like two full sentences

01:36.095 --> 01:38.537
without mentioning lord stuffy pants?

01:39.468 --> 01:42.054
Whoa, okay. Hey, you're the
one who made the big speech

01:42.055 --> 01:44.657
after we broke up about how
we could still be friends.

01:44.658 --> 01:47.504
Well, if you can't be supportive
of my relationship with Philip,

01:47.505 --> 01:49.904
then I think this little
experiment might be over.

01:49.905 --> 01:51.553
Meaning that we get back together?

01:53.159 --> 01:55.466
I love it when I say the words here... 

01:55.467 --> 01:58.725
And they mean something
totally different here.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.099
Fine.

02:03.711 --> 02:05.764
I will try and get to know Philip.

02:05.765 --> 02:06.944
Have him come by to the bar today.

02:06.945 --> 02:07.923
We can hang out during my break.

02:07.924 --> 02:10.104
Thank you for being so mature, Ben.

02:11.461 --> 02:12.935
His name is Phil and he's a bore,

02:12.936 --> 02:14.449
and that is why he makes us snore... 

02:14.450 --> 02:17.532
Phil's a snore! Phil's a snore!

02:17.533 --> 02:19.144

02:32.619 --> 02:34.751
about how one of your students
mistook you for the TA

02:34.752 --> 02:37.340
and said she heard the
Professor was super hot.

02:37.341 --> 02:38.650
Well, actually... 

02:39.256 --> 02:40.517
That was pretty much it.

Oh, my God. I love that story.

Nothing.

Oh, hey, can I get a beer?

02:55.207 --> 02:57.900
Oh, give me a minute. We're
just a little short-staffed.

02:57.901 --> 03:01.194
Yeah, probably shouldn't take
my break during the lunch rush.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.225
Trouble you for a pint, love?

03:03.226 --> 03:04.796
Right away.

03:07.399 --> 03:08.825
Wait, did you see that?

03:08.826 --> 03:10.699
What does he have that I don't?

03:10.700 --> 03:12.223
Well, I could make you a list.

03:14.106 --> 03:16.041
But let's start with the accent.

03:16.042 --> 03:17.864
Wait, really? Girls like that?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.650
May I present you exhibit... 

03:19.651 --> 03:21.949
(Female voice) "I love that story, ohh."

03:22.967 --> 03:24.776
Yeah yeah. Yeah.

03:25.090 --> 03:26.399
Well, in that case... 

03:26.719 --> 03:28.782

03:28.783 --> 03:31.401

03:34.016 --> 03:36.070
Uh, so, Ben... 

03:36.071 --> 03:37.786
Philip had some really fun ideas

03:37.787 --> 03:39.225
for when the two of you hang out.

03:39.744 --> 03:41.481
I thought this was the hanging out.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.150
But once you start, who
wants to stop, right?

03:46.517 --> 03:49.495
Brilliant. I thought maybe you
could pop by the campus later

03:49.496 --> 03:50.802
and I could show you around.

03:50.803 --> 03:52.275
Pop by the campus?

03:52.276 --> 03:54.610
Well, that's almost too much fun.

03:54.611 --> 03:55.886
I'll be there.

03:56.764 --> 03:59.064
<i>- (Mouthing)

04:00.443 --> 04:01.912

"Caesar salad with a side of anchovies."

04:05.857 --> 04:06.976
See?

04:06.977 --> 04:09.613
I hate anchovies, but
that sounds delicious.

(In British accent) Excuse me, barkeep,

04:13.072 --> 04:15.746
can I trouble you for a couple of pints?

04:15.747 --> 04:18.192
It's for my new lady friend.

04:18.875 --> 04:20.312

04:20.313 --> 04:22.033
(Normal voice) This
accent thing is amazing!

04:22.034 --> 04:24.248
You were right. You can
literally say anything,

04:24.249 --> 04:25.550
and women love it.

04:26.297 --> 04:27.988
(In British accent) Excuse
me, has anyone ever told you

04:27.989 --> 04:30.256
you've got an absolutely lovely bosom?

04:34.262 --> 04:37.162
(Normal voice) See? I just told
that girl she's got nice boobs,

04:37.163 --> 04:38.702
and I'm still standing here.

Well, hello.

05:06.707 --> 05:07.843
Hi, there.

05:07.844 --> 05:10.394
Are we finally sharing the
locker room with the ice girls?

05:10.395 --> 05:12.671
Because I put a request
in for that months ago.

05:12.672 --> 05:13.929
Oh, sorry to disappoint,

05:13.930 --> 05:15.715
but I am not one of your cheerleaders.

05:15.716 --> 05:16.950
Are you sure?

05:16.951 --> 05:18.740
Because I know I'm feeling inspired.

05:19.183 --> 05:21.505
Too bad you're not this
aggressive on the ice.

05:21.506 --> 05:23.847
Hey! I made some pretty good passes today.

05:23.848 --> 05:26.226
You're not counting this
as one of them, are you?

05:26.227 --> 05:27.954
(Exhales) Ouch!

05:27.955 --> 05:30.678
She takes me down, which
I'm totally okay with.

05:31.574 --> 05:33.228
All right, seriously?

05:33.229 --> 05:35.959
I cannot find that
talentless hack anywhere.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.866
Hey, do you know which
one of these jackasses

05:37.867 --> 05:39.504
is Logan Parker?

05:39.505 --> 05:42.625
Logan Parker, talentless
hack at your service.

05:47.783 --> 05:49.378

Gotcha! (Laughs)

06:03.325 --> 06:04.744
Now look what you've done!

06:05.201 --> 06:06.516
Whoa.

06:08.476 --> 06:09.730
After you, ladies.

06:10.741 --> 06:12.285
Oh-ho-ho!

06:12.286 --> 06:14.859
Maybe this whole college thing
isn't the worst idea after all.

06:14.860 --> 06:16.953
It has its perks, but I'm
afraid you're a little late

06:16.954 --> 06:18.239
and I have to leave for a meeting.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.335
Oh, am I? Do you?

06:20.336 --> 06:21.733
Darn it!

06:22.446 --> 06:24.437
Well, I guess I'll just take off then.

06:24.438 --> 06:26.365
But don't forget to tell
Riley that I came by... 

06:27.079 --> 06:28.780
Because I did.

06:28.781 --> 06:29.968
Actually, I won't be long.

06:29.969 --> 06:32.119
And the rest of my evening
is completely clear.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.922
(Chuckles) Of course it is.

06:34.534 --> 06:36.421
All right, I'm off. Make yourself at home.

06:41.928 --> 06:42.994
(Clears throat)

06:44.289 --> 06:46.164
(Mocking Philip) Hello, Philip here.

06:46.165 --> 06:47.649
Can I get someone to come down here

06:47.650 --> 06:49.687
and pull the stick out of me arse?

06:50.388 --> 06:51.488
(Knocks on door)

06:51.489 --> 06:52.588
Professor Farlow, are you busy?

06:52.589 --> 06:53.807
No no no, I'm not... 

06:54.437 --> 06:56.060
(In British accent) ... Busy at all.

06:56.852 --> 06:58.423
What can I do for you, love?

06:58.424 --> 07:00.413
I was hoping to audit
your art history seminar.

07:00.414 --> 07:01.830
I brought the form.

07:01.831 --> 07:03.880
Oh, you can audit me anytime.

07:04.656 --> 07:05.648
Excuse me?

07:05.649 --> 07:07.673
Why don't we discuss
it further over a pint?

07:08.251 --> 07:11.277
I may need to give you an entrance exam.

07:14.203 --> 07:15.614
(Ringing)

07:18.068 --> 07:19.720
<i>- Hello?
-  Danny?</i>

07:19.721 --> 07:21.127
Where did you go?

07:21.128 --> 07:23.240
I'm home. I always nap after practice.

07:23.241 --> 07:25.541
<i>Okay, I turn my head for like two... </i>

07:27.903 --> 07:30.619
Three seconds, and you disappear.

07:30.620 --> 07:33.200
You were supposed to try and talk to Logan.

07:33.201 --> 07:35.149
<i>- Oh, I did.
- (Gasps) You did?</i>

07:35.150 --> 07:37.378
Okay, that... that's
great. So, how'd it go?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.896
Not exactly how I thought it would.

07:44.193 --> 07:46.959
- (Both laughing)
- That's so good!

07:46.960 --> 07:49.565
Oh, my God. You guys are never
going to believe what happened.

07:49.566 --> 07:52.084
I had a good time with Phil. No,
I know, I don't believe it either.

07:52.730 --> 07:55.895
No, apparently some woman asked
to audit Philip's class yesterday,

07:55.896 --> 07:57.680
and claims he totally hit on her.

07:57.681 --> 07:59.432
What?! How could she?

07:59.433 --> 08:01.217
He! How could he?!

08:02.345 --> 08:05.659
He's been called before the Dean
and accused of sexual harassment.

08:05.660 --> 08:08.943
Harassment?! That's a pretty strong
word for a little innocent flirting.

08:09.359 --> 08:10.834
I'm assuming.

08:11.629 --> 08:14.062
You know, the brits actually pronounce it

08:14.063 --> 08:16.096
"harrisment." (Laughs)

08:16.398 --> 08:19.382
Truly, they can make anything sound classy.

08:19.383 --> 08:21.207
(In British accent) My bum itches.

08:21.208 --> 08:23.098
Fancy a scratch? (Laughing)

08:23.917 --> 08:25.912
Tucker, this is serious.

08:25.913 --> 08:28.964
- They're probably going to fire him.
- Fire him?!

08:28.965 --> 08:31.102
Is that really fair? Maybe
it's just a misunderstanding.

08:31.103 --> 08:32.816
God, I just... I should have known.

08:32.817 --> 08:34.013
It was too good to be true.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.773
Why is it that every time
I fall for the perfect guy

08:36.774 --> 08:39.573
he turns out to be just the perfect jerk?

08:40.167 --> 08:41.542
No offense.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.193
But there are two sides to every story.

08:44.195 --> 08:45.809
Sometimes even three.

08:46.634 --> 08:48.426
(Normal voice) No. Oh, hell nah.

08:48.427 --> 08:50.297
Look, nah.

08:50.298 --> 08:52.935
Listen, I say where
there's smoke, there's fire.

08:52.936 --> 08:54.706
Which means, girl, get
your ass out that building

08:54.707 --> 08:56.274
before you get burned.

08:59.069 --> 09:00.442
See? See?

09:00.443 --> 09:01.852
Thank you. Tucker gets it.

09:01.853 --> 09:05.271
But... but aren't you the one who's
always saying innocent until proven guilty?

09:05.272 --> 09:07.273
No. Why would I... 

09:07.274 --> 09:09.125
Oh, lawyer. Right.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.709
Well, he did deny everything.

09:11.710 --> 09:13.278
- See?
- Uh-uh, he lyin'.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.529
You're right. Of course.
Of course he's lying.

09:16.970 --> 09:20.353
Or perhaps you're turning your
back on a man wrongfully accused.

09:20.758 --> 09:23.566
Riley, you have to trust your heart

09:23.567 --> 09:25.444
and give him the benefit of the doubt.

09:26.945 --> 09:28.984
You're right. (Exhales)

09:28.985 --> 09:30.297
Thanks, Ben.

09:30.298 --> 09:32.226
You really are a good friend.

09:32.227 --> 09:33.649
Remember that.

09:35.773 --> 09:38.713
Well, I have got to go
find Philip and apologize.

09:38.714 --> 09:40.272
You know, I may have called
him a no-good philanderer

09:40.596 --> 09:43.370
and made a disparaging
remark about the crown jewels.

09:44.466 --> 09:46.358
His, not the Queen's.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.411
(Chuckles) Wow.

09:50.773 --> 09:54.381
Hey, Ben, when did you
become such a Philip fan?

09:54.382 --> 09:56.133
When I realized that
Riley will never forgive me

09:56.134 --> 09:57.684
if she finds out the truth.

09:57.685 --> 09:59.348
Philip didn't hit on a student.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.469
It was me.

10:00.470 --> 10:02.220
Oh, my God. Philip hit on you?

10:05.314 --> 10:06.753
Dude, I'm telling you,

10:06.754 --> 10:09.079
you can never tell with those brits.

10:10.260 --> 10:11.608
No!

10:11.609 --> 10:13.092
I hit on one of his students

10:13.093 --> 10:14.937
using your stupid accent routine.

10:14.938 --> 10:16.705
- And did it work?
- Obviously not.

10:16.706 --> 10:18.474
Well, then it wasn't my routine.

10:22.383 --> 10:24.738
Okay, after a few failed attempts,

10:24.739 --> 10:26.356
I am finally out of here.

10:26.357 --> 10:28.839
- See ya.
- Hey, slow down.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.459
Not to be all girly, but no goodbye kiss?

10:32.249 --> 10:33.722
Ooh, Danny.

10:33.723 --> 10:35.691
I'm sorry, but I can't.

10:35.692 --> 10:37.837
- This was bad.
- Sorry.

10:37.838 --> 10:40.108
First time's usually a little awkward.

10:41.761 --> 10:43.320
Danny, this is a conflict of interest.

10:43.321 --> 10:44.538
I can be fired.

10:44.539 --> 10:47.287
Oh, well, we'll just make sure
that nobody else finds out.

10:47.288 --> 10:49.225
Just don't write anything too nice about me

10:49.226 --> 10:50.652
in the paper tomorrow.

10:50.653 --> 10:51.870
Wait.

10:51.871 --> 10:53.569
Is that what this is about?

10:53.570 --> 10:56.025
Is that why you talked me into bed?

10:56.026 --> 10:57.712
You want me to go easy on you?!

10:57.713 --> 10:59.293
Whoa whoa, calm down.

10:59.294 --> 11:00.381
No.

11:00.382 --> 11:02.366
You can go any way you want on me.

11:03.595 --> 11:05.189
Logan, I like you.

11:05.190 --> 11:06.770
And I like you too.

11:06.771 --> 11:08.681
Which is why this will never work.

11:08.682 --> 11:11.075
I have to be able to
write the truth about you.

11:11.076 --> 11:14.206
And unfortunately, your game's
not as pretty as you are.

11:15.284 --> 11:17.581
Hey... I'm working on it.

11:17.582 --> 11:19.183
Not as hard as you should be.

11:19.184 --> 11:20.666
I think you're a really good player,

11:20.667 --> 11:22.171
but you could be great.

11:22.172 --> 11:23.204
You really think so?

11:23.205 --> 11:24.650
Yeah, I do.

11:27.869 --> 11:29.102
See you around, Wheeler.

11:34.676 --> 11:35.992
- Hello, Logan!
- (Yelps)

11:35.993 --> 11:38.800
(Exhales) Ah, the mother.

11:39.327 --> 11:40.651
Hi. I was just... 

11:40.652 --> 11:43.391
Oh, I know exactly what you were just... 

11:44.324 --> 11:45.448
Seriously?

11:45.449 --> 11:48.287
I live across the alley, and those boys
leave the blinds open all the time.

11:49.614 --> 11:51.672
Well, I hope you enjoyed the show,

11:51.673 --> 11:53.774
but it was a one night only kinda thing.

11:53.775 --> 11:55.720
Ohh, that's too bad.

11:55.721 --> 11:57.690
I was going to invite your editor

11:57.691 --> 11:59.343
to the next performance.

12:00.748 --> 12:01.884
My editor?

12:02.254 --> 12:04.765
That sounds like a
not-so-very-veiled threat.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.127
Oh, and here I was afraid
you weren't gonna get it.

12:08.748 --> 12:10.198
Oh, I get it.

12:10.199 --> 12:12.174
And now I'm just waiting
to hear what you want.

12:12.175 --> 12:14.731
Well, what I want is a star map,

12:14.732 --> 12:18.142
an unmarked van and the alarm
code to Jon Bon Jovi's house.

12:20.217 --> 12:22.483
But I'll settle for you

12:22.484 --> 12:25.154
writing a nice article about Danny.

12:25.155 --> 12:28.467
So you want me to throw away
my journalistic integrity?

12:28.468 --> 12:30.038
Oh, honey, you left that
on Danny's nightstand

12:30.039 --> 12:32.135
next to your morals and scruples.

12:33.752 --> 12:34.890
Wow.

12:35.357 --> 12:38.249
I have faced a lot of
challenges in this business.

12:38.250 --> 12:41.605
I never thought my biggest one
would come from another woman.

12:41.606 --> 12:42.904
Oh, I'm not a woman.

12:44.477 --> 12:46.342
I'm a mother.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.344
Dude, what is taking you so long?

12:55.345 --> 12:57.967
You know I'm not good
at looking inconspicuous.

12:57.968 --> 13:00.386
In related news, I'm
rushing sigma beta kappa.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.289
I'm sorry, man.

13:02.290 --> 13:03.448
I just gotta find that girl's paperwork.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.290
She left it here
somewhere. Here, hold Emma.

13:05.608 --> 13:08.494
Dude, I cannot believe you
brought your baby on a heist.

13:08.495 --> 13:09.918
Are you kidding? It's genius.

13:09.919 --> 13:12.755
If someone catches me, I was just
looking for a place to change the baby.

13:12.756 --> 13:15.381
And trust me, not one's gonna be
checking to see if I'm telling the truth.

13:15.382 --> 13:17.351
<i>Hilip:  I'll just be two
seconds and we'll be on our way.</i>

13:17.352 --> 13:18.505
That's him!

13:18.846 --> 13:20.795
Under the desk. Go go go.

13:24.014 --> 13:25.332
I can't tell you how much it means to me

13:25.333 --> 13:26.796
that you're standing
by me through all this.

13:26.797 --> 13:28.975
Oh, well, you kinda have
Ben to thank for that.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.134
See, I knew he wasn't as
bad as you made him out be.

13:31.988 --> 13:33.885
There has to be something you can do.

13:33.886 --> 13:34.794
You have to fight this.

13:34.795 --> 13:35.885
It's her word against mine.

13:35.886 --> 13:37.128
And since I'm the teacher without tenure,

13:37.545 --> 13:39.429
easier on everyone just to fire me.

13:39.430 --> 13:40.694
Well, I'll hire you.

13:41.127 --> 13:43.477
You know, for general boyfriend duties,

13:43.478 --> 13:44.886
maybe some light housekeeping.

13:45.729 --> 13:48.751
Unfortunately, this whole
mess is now delaying my visa.

13:48.752 --> 13:51.076
If I don't get it, I'm packing to go home.

13:51.467 --> 13:53.453
No, you can't go now.

13:53.454 --> 13:55.378
I just started to understand you.

13:56.339 --> 13:57.864
There really is nothing we can do.

14:00.071 --> 14:01.278
Unless... 

14:02.965 --> 14:04.317
Unless what?

14:05.556 --> 14:07.798
Riley, is there any
chance you'd consider... 

14:09.308 --> 14:10.763
Marrying me?

14:16.242 --> 14:17.718
- Hey, Logan. Can I talk to you?
- No!

14:17.719 --> 14:19.444
Then I guess you don't
want your computer back.

14:19.445 --> 14:20.994
Of course that's where I left it.

14:20.995 --> 14:23.381
Mm-hmm. And this day just
goes from bad to worse.

14:23.798 --> 14:25.776
Hey, I know you don't want
everyone to know about us,

14:25.777 --> 14:27.489
but can you turn the hostile down?

14:27.490 --> 14:28.823
You're making me feel bad.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.680
Oh, and I'm supposed to
care about your feelings

14:30.681 --> 14:32.560
after what you and your mom pulled?

14:32.561 --> 14:34.006
What does my mom have to do with this?

14:34.007 --> 14:35.265
Don't play dumb, Wheeler.

14:35.266 --> 14:36.686
And don't even worry about me.

14:36.687 --> 14:38.444
I already asked to get
transferred to another beat.

14:38.754 --> 14:41.655
Oh, and good luck sleeping with
the next reporter they send in.

14:42.104 --> 14:45.140
Unless it's Ken. He likes tall guys.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.041
Just know... 

14:47.042 --> 14:48.648
That you are never gonna
be better than mediocre

14:48.649 --> 14:50.247
if you're not willing to hear the truth.

14:51.589 --> 14:53.304
Danny! Have you seen Phil and Riley?

14:53.305 --> 14:54.622
They're not in their seats.

14:54.623 --> 14:56.479
Oh, yeah, she called. They can't make it.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.180
Something about having to go
by their friend court's house.

14:59.181 --> 15:02.846
Or possibly the courthouse?

15:02.847 --> 15:04.824
No, I'm pretty sure she said court's house.

15:05.482 --> 15:07.802
She wouldn't actually go
through with it, would she?

15:07.803 --> 15:10.831
(In British accent) I don't
suppose you'd consider marrying me?

15:10.832 --> 15:12.949
(Normal voice) Dude, I almost said yes!

15:12.950 --> 15:14.911
We've gotta go. Oh, mom! Good. You're here.

15:14.912 --> 15:16.505
Hey, do you wanna hold
Emma for like two seconds?

15:16.506 --> 15:17.560
- Yes.
- Thanks.

15:17.561 --> 15:18.697
Do you wanna hold the bag for another sec?

15:18.698 --> 15:19.928
- Oh, yeah yeah.
- Sweet... 

15:22.696 --> 15:24.433
Mom, did you talk to Logan?

15:24.434 --> 15:26.763
Oh, I did more than talk to her.

15:26.764 --> 15:28.530
I kinda blackmailed her.

15:28.531 --> 15:30.757
Yeah.Show mama some love, huh?

15:30.758 --> 15:32.152
Yeah?

15:34.953 --> 15:37.423
- Do you see her?
- Oh oh! There she is.

15:37.424 --> 15:39.710
Aw, I like that she's not wearing white.

15:39.711 --> 15:40.911
It's more honest.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.097
Riley, wait.

15:44.725 --> 15:46.061
Ben, what are you doing here?

15:46.062 --> 15:47.401
Trying to stop you from doing something

15:47.402 --> 15:49.367
you could end up regretting
for the rest of your life.

15:49.368 --> 15:50.881
Riley, this is too big a decision.

15:50.882 --> 15:52.124
You can't just rush into this.

15:52.125 --> 15:55.045
Rest of my life? This is
maybe three years, tops.

15:55.046 --> 15:56.951
And what do you really
even know about him anyway?

15:56.952 --> 16:00.434
Yeah, sure, he looks like a
prince and talks like a Butler,

16:00.764 --> 16:04.681
but superficial reasons aren't enough
to write your name down next to his.

16:10.673 --> 16:12.431
(Chuckles softly) But you're
the one who convinced me

16:12.432 --> 16:13.710
how great he was.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.780
And you picked today to
start listening to me?

16:17.300 --> 16:19.685
And using her like this
to stay in the country?

16:19.686 --> 16:21.703
How can you live with yourself?

16:26.108 --> 16:28.600
Ben, it's just a piece of paper.

16:28.601 --> 16:30.808
No, it's not. Don't you get it?

16:30.809 --> 16:33.110
This shouldn't just be your
first. This should be your only.

16:33.111 --> 16:34.881
Your happily ever after.

16:34.882 --> 16:37.599
And it should be with a
guy who understands you

16:37.600 --> 16:40.790
and will be by your side
when you're old and ugly

16:40.791 --> 16:42.294
and you need one of those chairs

16:42.295 --> 16:43.875
that goes up and down stairs.

16:45.063 --> 16:47.369
My Nana actually died in one of those.

16:49.766 --> 16:52.310
Yeah, she just kept going
up and down for like two days

16:52.311 --> 16:53.699
before we found her.

16:54.086 --> 16:55.942
(mouthing)

17:00.736 --> 17:03.207
What exactly do you think we're doing?

17:03.208 --> 17:04.419
Getting married.

17:04.420 --> 17:06.587
No! Why would I do that?

17:06.588 --> 17:09.671
Ben, I'm here helping Philip
with the paperwork for his visa.

17:10.171 --> 17:11.742
But aren't you getting fired?

17:11.743 --> 17:13.644
Oh, no, the university called.

17:13.645 --> 17:15.563
Apparently, the young woman saw my picture,

17:15.564 --> 17:17.093
realized she'd made a mistake.

17:17.935 --> 17:19.450
Ohh... 

17:20.444 --> 17:22.231
Well, then, in that case,

17:22.232 --> 17:23.732
have a lovely afternoon
and welcome to the States.

17:24.207 --> 17:25.237
Yeah.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.444
But, you know, I'm wondering

17:27.444 --> 17:30.204
what she'd say if we
showed her your picture.

17:30.205 --> 17:31.319
My picture?

17:31.771 --> 17:33.429
(Sighs deeply)

17:33.430 --> 17:36.424
(In British accent) Well, isn't
this just a dilly of a pickle?

17:36.425 --> 17:37.726
(Chuckles)

17:38.764 --> 17:41.114
Oh, my God, Ben, what is wrong with you?!

17:41.115 --> 17:43.345
Riley, I was just trying to prove
to you I could be your friend

17:43.346 --> 17:44.898
by trying to be his friend.

17:45.212 --> 17:47.539
- And then Tucker suggested... 
- Ooh, don't even go there.

17:49.587 --> 17:51.769
Philip, man, I'm so sorry.

17:52.258 --> 17:53.408
You've been nothing but nice to me,

17:53.409 --> 17:55.116
and I've been nothing but a jerk to you.

17:56.009 --> 17:57.435
Ben, you're an odd fellow.

17:57.970 --> 18:00.934
But you are one of Riley's oldest friends.

18:00.935 --> 18:02.359
Mm, let's not get crazy.

18:03.191 --> 18:06.751
So I suppose the right thing
to do is accept your apology.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.564
What about you, Riley?

18:10.724 --> 18:13.166
I still can't believe you
thought I would get married.

18:13.664 --> 18:15.278
In this.

18:17.011 --> 18:19.664
But if Philip can forgive you,

18:19.665 --> 18:22.001
then I guess I can too.

18:22.526 --> 18:24.191
- Hug?
- Mm, I'm not there yet.

18:25.055 --> 18:26.118
Good enough for me.

18:27.718 --> 18:29.136
Tucker, man, you comin'?

18:29.137 --> 18:30.385
Yeah yeah yeah. In a sec.

18:30.386 --> 18:32.256
Kelly and Joe asked me
to be their best man.

18:35.634 --> 18:36.735
<i>(Knocking on door)</i>

18:36.736 --> 18:37.892
It's open.

18:38.962 --> 18:40.678
Your message said you
weren't gonna be here.

18:41.082 --> 18:44.690
For some reason, people seem to get
upset when you leave a baby alone.

18:45.820 --> 18:48.266
What the hell is this?
Did you use my computer?

18:48.267 --> 18:50.979
It's a little article
about how my drop pass sucks

18:50.980 --> 18:52.441
and I need to work on my speed.

18:52.833 --> 18:55.588
What the hell is this?! Do you
see what just went up online?

18:56.015 --> 18:57.865
Oh, you!

18:59.196 --> 19:01.279
You are going down.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.763
When I am done, the only
thing you'll be writing

19:03.764 --> 19:06.192
is people's names on coffee cups!

19:07.339 --> 19:09.926
Mom, Logan didn't write the story. I did.

19:09.927 --> 19:13.012
Really? Why would you write that you're not

19:13.013 --> 19:14.804
living up to your potential?

19:14.805 --> 19:17.248
And when did you learn
how to spell "potential"?!

19:21.261 --> 19:22.783
Why would you do that?

19:22.784 --> 19:24.702
I didn't want you to
think that I was using you.

19:25.428 --> 19:27.145
And how am I supposed
to become a better player

19:27.146 --> 19:29.180
if you stop everyone from criticizing me?

19:29.181 --> 19:30.337
I mean, what are you gonna do next?

19:30.338 --> 19:31.865
Start dating the owner?

19:31.866 --> 19:33.449
I'm working on it.

19:34.700 --> 19:37.456
But he keeps changing his cellphone number.
(Groans softly)

19:38.897 --> 19:41.495
You can't keep trying to beat
up all the bullies for me.

19:41.496 --> 19:42.877
I can take a few hits.

19:42.878 --> 19:45.604
But, Danny, I am just doing
what I think is best for you.

19:45.605 --> 19:47.603
I know. And I love you for it.

19:48.808 --> 19:51.037
And I don't know what to say.

19:51.038 --> 19:52.729
Maybe I did misjudge you.

19:52.730 --> 19:54.943
Not your playing, but you.

19:55.860 --> 19:56.955
Well, great.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.577
I guess I've got all three of
my ladies taken care of then.

19:59.578 --> 20:00.857
All three?

20:01.735 --> 20:03.136
Hey, darlin'.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.098
I traded her pom-poms for a puck.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.863
Emma, you can be whatever you wanna be.

20:08.864 --> 20:11.775
A cheerleader, an
athlete, a writer or a mom.

20:12.111 --> 20:16.095
Well, you might not wanna be a
cheerleader and a mom at the same time.

20:17.404 --> 20:19.835
(Groaning) It was tough.

20:22.063 --> 20:23.299
Are you sure we can't
keep seeing each other?

20:23.707 --> 20:24.665
I'm sure.

20:25.020 --> 20:26.843
(Both panting)

20:28.021 --> 20:29.687
You're right, we can't keep doing this.

20:29.688 --> 20:30.669
Uh-uh.

20:30.670 --> 20:31.830
So same time tomorrow?

20:31.831 --> 20:33.373
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

20:36.548 --> 20:39.120
(In British accent)
You are a cheeky little dove.

20:39.121 --> 20:41.403
I'd like to fly you home to my nest.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.242
(Laughs)

20:43.243 --> 20:45.669
Tucker, your accent is
almost perfect... amazing.

20:45.670 --> 20:46.952
Okay okay, now me, now me.

20:47.317 --> 20:48.752
(In Irish accent) I'm a Randy lad

20:48.753 --> 20:51.503
looking for a good snog. Care to join me?

20:52.635 --> 20:54.780
Or maybe we could try... 

20:55.829 --> 20:58.277
My mate says American
girls don't kiss well.

20:58.278 --> 20:59.476
I disagree.

20:59.858 --> 21:01.355
Care to settle the argument?

21:02.081 --> 21:04.395
- Oh, that is so good!
- Oh, damn!

21:04.976 --> 21:06.524
That is so good! I love it, man.

21:06.970 --> 21:08.700
This was all before I met you, darling.

21:09.681 --> 21:11.216
Uh, remind me again

21:11.217 --> 21:13.091
why I insisted you guys hang out?

21:13.092 --> 21:14.635
- (Guys laugh)
- Who knows?

21:14.636 --> 21:17.609
- We love him!
- New bestie! (Laughs)
