WEBVTT

00:07.746 --> 00:10.227
Previously onSWAT...I had a hell of a day.

00:10.271 --> 00:12.229
And when it ended, I just
realized the only thing

00:12.273 --> 00:14.623
I wanted to see
was your face.

00:14.666 --> 00:16.190
You're still gonna try
to pass the PFQ?

00:16.233 --> 00:18.757
I'm gonna do it. I just
need to be with my team.

00:18.801 --> 00:20.063
HONDO:
JP Hicks. Commander's son.

00:20.107 --> 00:22.935
We both know
that I'm not the man you tried

00:22.979 --> 00:25.373
to raise me to be.When Barb got
close to the end,

00:25.416 --> 00:27.114
JP's addiction got worse.

00:27.157 --> 00:28.550
I really miss her.

00:28.593 --> 00:29.812
I know.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.729
[chuckles]
Nichelle, if I had known

00:33.772 --> 00:35.296
this is what
"stopping by" meant...

00:35.339 --> 00:39.604
Hey, if my man can bench 300
pounds, you'd best believe

00:39.648 --> 00:42.433
I'm gonna be taking
advantage of that.

00:42.477 --> 00:44.087
Hey, you...

00:44.131 --> 00:47.047
I got better ideas on how
you can be taking advantage.

00:48.961 --> 00:50.093
[chuckles]

00:50.137 --> 00:51.790
Mm-mm, no.
Aw...

00:51.834 --> 00:53.401
Not right now.
I got to get this place

00:53.444 --> 00:54.402
ready for
tomorrow night.

00:54.445 --> 00:55.620
All right.

00:55.664 --> 00:56.926
So, who you got
coming through

00:56.969 --> 00:58.319
to inspire young minds
this month?

00:58.362 --> 01:01.757
For once, someone the
kids think is cool.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.672
It's that rapper, FarKrai.

01:05.717 --> 01:08.416
FarKrai?
Baby, he rose to the top

01:08.459 --> 01:10.809
with a song about
putting bullets in cops.

01:10.853 --> 01:13.116
Are you sure that's the kind
of message you want to spread?

01:13.160 --> 01:16.206
That song was a metaphor
for the frustrations

01:16.250 --> 01:17.816
people have
with the system.

01:17.860 --> 01:21.037
It was also seven years ago.
He's evolved.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.995
Even if he does have
good intentions now,

01:23.039 --> 01:25.302
he still comes
with a lot of baggage.

01:25.346 --> 01:26.825
FarKrai made good
and has been

01:26.869 --> 01:29.001
giving back to the tune of
millions of dollars.

01:29.045 --> 01:32.179
The kind of activism
you and I want to encourage.

01:32.222 --> 01:34.398
And he still rolls with the
same bangers he grew up with.

01:34.442 --> 01:37.575
Nichelle, loyalty can get you
killed in these streets.

01:37.619 --> 01:39.229
Now, maybe FarKrai isn't about
that life anymore,

01:39.273 --> 01:41.536
but hanging with people who are,
he's glamorizing it.

01:41.579 --> 01:43.233
He's a complicated figure.

01:43.277 --> 01:46.889
Okay, look. I have been
working on this for weeks.

01:46.932 --> 01:48.325
The things
you're saying,

01:48.369 --> 01:49.631
I've thought them
through already, okay?

01:49.674 --> 01:51.154
I've weighed the
pros and the cons.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.461
I'm sure you have,
but you need to...Hondo,

01:53.504 --> 01:55.898
I don't need your help here.
This isn't a cop thing.

01:55.941 --> 01:57.595
No, this is a South L.A. thing.

01:57.639 --> 01:58.944
That's why I understand
this issue.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.470
I may not have grown up here,

02:02.513 --> 02:04.385
but I'm not as naive
as you may think.

02:04.428 --> 02:06.169
This is my call.

02:06.213 --> 02:08.650
Okay? So, if this is
really how you feel,

02:08.693 --> 02:10.173
you shouldn't come
tomorrow night.

02:11.174 --> 02:13.350
I'll set up myself.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.182
All right.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.192
Sergeant Wilkins told me as soon
as you finished this morning.

02:29.236 --> 02:30.846
There's no reason
to beat around the bush.

02:30.889 --> 02:32.326
You already know
you failed the PFQ.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.066
Yeah.Not all of it.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.677
You exceeded expectations
in the pull-ups, the sit-ups.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.026
It was just the...Three-mile run.

02:37.069 --> 02:38.723
I know. And there's
no need to worry.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.290
Oh, I'm not.Okay.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.639
You just had
hip surgery.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.032
Your rehab commitment
is impressive.

02:43.075 --> 02:44.686
There's no reason why
you can't retake

02:44.729 --> 02:46.166
that section in a few weeks.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.994
Yeah, until then, I got to
ride the pine at HQ.

02:49.038 --> 02:51.649
And, you know, I missed it by,
like, this much, Commander.

02:51.693 --> 02:54.696
I know.I'd like to sign up
for the next qualifier.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.741
Luca, that's in three days.I know.

02:56.785 --> 02:59.309
You fail the second PFQ,
department regulations

02:59.353 --> 03:02.225
has you riding the bench
for months.

03:02.269 --> 03:05.097
Just, why not get in
a little more physical therapy?

03:05.141 --> 03:07.665
I don't need more rehab, sir.
I need to get past this

03:07.709 --> 03:09.711
and get back out there.I'm not saying no.

03:09.754 --> 03:12.279
I'm just saying, take a day.

03:12.322 --> 03:14.498
Think it over.
And if you still insist,

03:14.542 --> 03:17.501
then I'll approve your sign-up.[door opens]

03:17.545 --> 03:19.764
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize
that you had a meeting going.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.157
No, it's all good, JP.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.637
How you doing, man?Good to see you, Luca.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.942
You, too, man.

03:23.986 --> 03:25.335
Our dinner's not
until next week, right?

03:25.379 --> 03:27.250
I'm sorry I had to reschedule
so many times.

03:27.294 --> 03:28.512
It's just been busy.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.035
No, please, don't
worry about it.

03:30.079 --> 03:32.647
I actually came here to
ask you for a favor.

03:32.690 --> 03:34.257
Um, this is my
friend Frida.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.390
Hello, sir.Hi.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.696
Her car got
impounded today, and...

03:38.740 --> 03:42.134
we were kind of hoping you could
help us get it un-impounded.

03:42.178 --> 03:43.658
Rack up a bunch
of parking tickets?

03:43.701 --> 03:46.051
JP:
Look, I know it's not
official SWAT business,

03:46.095 --> 03:47.662
but she really
needs it back.

03:47.705 --> 03:50.273
What your son isn't saying is
I live in that car.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.319
It's got all my things.

03:52.362 --> 03:54.582
My bed.
Okay, I see.

03:54.625 --> 03:57.280
Um, I can't promise anything,
but I'll make a few phone calls.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.500
Do you have a safe place
to spend the night?

03:59.543 --> 04:00.849
My floor.

04:00.892 --> 04:03.678
Um, so here's
all the car info.

04:04.983 --> 04:07.421
All right, well,
I'll be in touch tomorrow.

04:07.464 --> 04:08.552

Hope is the kidnappers
are still in the area.

Well, party in the hills,
few roads in and out.

05:58.445 --> 06:01.056

wanted some air for a sec.

When we tried to go back,

06:42.010 --> 06:43.794
there were cops everywhere.STREET:
You figured the house

06:43.838 --> 06:45.143
was busted, so you
tried to slip out

before anyone noticed
you were missing, huh?

while you were

06:50.061 --> 06:51.106
getting some air?

06:51.149 --> 06:52.803
No, sir.

06:53.543 --> 06:54.849
Seems like you guys have

06:54.892 --> 06:56.981
more important stuff to do
than walk us home?

07:02.857 --> 07:04.467
DEACON:
Hondo and Stevens

07:04.511 --> 07:06.469
found the kidnappers' vehicle.
It was abandoned.

07:06.513 --> 07:09.341
Swapped rides.
Now they're really in the wind.Well, maybe not.

07:09.385 --> 07:11.300
Bunch of the kids at the party
reported that the kidnappers

07:11.343 --> 07:13.302
called Zane Coleman's
phone before taking him.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.739
Quick way to I.D.
someone in a crowd.Do we know who called him?

07:15.783 --> 07:17.611
Yeah. Well, Zane's a-a
minor, so RHD was able

07:17.654 --> 07:19.308
to access his phone
records without a warrant.

07:19.351 --> 07:20.962
Call came in from
a phone registered

07:21.005 --> 07:22.137
to a Joel Powell.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.834
Now, he's got no priors,

07:23.878 --> 07:25.314
no connections
to the Coleman family.

07:25.357 --> 07:26.620
But his apartment
is located close

07:26.663 --> 07:28.143
to the family mega-mansion.Yeah.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.927
He clocks the wealth, the kid.
He sees an opportunity.

07:29.971 --> 07:32.452
Guy uses his own phone
during an abduction?

07:32.495 --> 07:34.366
It seems too easy.Or too stupid.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.281
If that means
we can get Zane home quicker,

07:36.325 --> 07:37.805
it's all the better for us.

07:39.197 --> 07:41.199
So, I heard Powell's smarter
than he first looked.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.811
Unfortunately. From the smell
of the dishes in his sink,

07:43.854 --> 07:45.595
he cleared out
of his place days ago.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.292
We didn't find
any planning materials,

07:47.336 --> 07:49.164
nothing to indicate where
he might have taken Zane.

07:49.207 --> 07:50.644
Seems like a gnarly safe

07:50.687 --> 07:52.950
for just a passport
and some tax documents, though.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.474
Chris, you're freshly certified.

07:54.517 --> 07:55.823
You sure you can pop it?

07:55.866 --> 07:57.520
On my way to find out.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.566
HICKS:
So, what did we find
in Powell's home?

08:01.176 --> 08:03.178
This is Zane?

STREET:
Mm-hmm. Candid photo, long lens.

08:04.701 --> 08:06.616

he was being watched.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.183
More like stalked.

08:08.226 --> 08:10.098
Powell's got newspaper articles
about Zane's baseball team.

08:10.141 --> 08:11.534
Copy of his yearbook.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.231
Nothing on the parents?
No financial records

08:13.275 --> 08:15.277
or job info?STREET:
Just a bunch of creepy stuff

08:15.320 --> 08:17.409
that tells us he's obsessed
with someone else's kid.

08:17.453 --> 08:18.454
Who is this guy?

08:18.498 --> 08:20.021
I don't know.
But, Commander,

08:20.064 --> 08:21.936
this isn't some kidnap
and ransom scheme.

08:21.979 --> 08:23.764
Whatever Powell
wants from Zane,

08:23.807 --> 08:25.809
it ain't about money.

08:27.245 --> 08:29.247

09:06.546 --> 09:07.895
So, our suspect, Joel Powell,

09:07.938 --> 09:09.592
is about as vanilla
as you can get.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.507
LUCA: Yeah, he's been
in L.A. three years.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.726
Originally from Chicago.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.510
But, um, there's
no history of stalking.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.164
Not in any database
of sexual predators.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.687
What about the
two accomplices?

09:17.731 --> 09:19.733
The kids said that the men
never took off their masks.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.430
We've got no way
to I.D. them.

09:21.473 --> 09:24.259
Officers, this is Zane's
father, Mark Coleman.

09:24.302 --> 09:25.826
His wife was already
on the plane

09:25.869 --> 09:27.436
back from Europe
when Zane was taken.

09:27.479 --> 09:28.872
I-I've been trying
to reach Leah,

09:28.916 --> 09:30.918
but she usually sleeps
through that flight.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.355
She doesn't even know that Zane
is missing. It's a nightmare.

09:33.398 --> 09:34.661
We'll coordinate
with the FAA,

09:34.704 --> 09:36.097

you know this man?

09:39.666 --> 09:41.581
Has he contacted you
about a ransom?

09:41.624 --> 09:43.104
Because we're willing
to pay anything.

09:43.147 --> 09:44.627
LUCA:
Actually, we think

09:44.671 --> 09:47.195
it might be more personal.Like, a revenge thing? I-I...

09:47.238 --> 09:48.892
I'll get you a list
of everyone that Leah and I

09:48.936 --> 09:50.328
have worked with.HONDO:
Unfortunately, Mr. Coleman,

09:50.372 --> 09:52.287
Powell seems to have some kind
of obsession with Zane.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.941
What kind of obsession?

09:53.984 --> 09:54.942
We're not sure.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.639
This is all my fault.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.642
I told Zane it would be fine
to go to the party

09:59.686 --> 10:01.035
as long as he didn't
get into a car

10:01.078 --> 10:02.863
with someone that's
been drinking.It's okay.

10:02.906 --> 10:04.560
You rest assured
that LAPD and SWAT

10:04.604 --> 10:06.954
are doing everything
possible to find your son.

10:06.997 --> 10:08.477
Look, there's still an
active Amber Alert.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.131
Even if the kidnappers
swapped vehicles,

10:10.174 --> 10:11.698
someone could spot Zane.

10:11.741 --> 10:13.743
Powell's not trying to hide.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.136
Now he's completely vanished?

10:15.179 --> 10:17.486
Something strange going on here.

10:17.529 --> 10:18.792
HONDO:
Chris is working
on his safe.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.663
We'll know Powell's secrets
soon enough.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.458
Pressure sensors ready.

10:33.502 --> 10:35.635

10:38.289 --> 10:40.248

particular safe has

10:40.291 --> 10:43.164
over 64 million
combinations?

10:43.207 --> 10:45.732
It might take a
minute... or ten.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.168
Worth the wait.

10:47.211 --> 10:49.083
Kinds of stuff
Powell leaves lying out,

10:49.126 --> 10:51.128

what he's locking away.

10:53.783 --> 10:54.828

Hey.

10:54.871 --> 10:57.265
I only got a minute. I'm sorry.

10:57.308 --> 10:59.963
It's okay. We'll be quick.
Any word on Frida's car?

11:00.007 --> 11:01.182
Well, it depends.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.836
I called over, and I was able

11:02.879 --> 11:04.533
to get the parking tickets
waived, but, um...

11:04.576 --> 11:06.143
But...?

11:07.405 --> 11:09.625
The impound lot
cross-checked with the DMV.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.627
Your registration's
been lapsed two years.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.542
Now, you're gonna
have to get it renewed,

11:13.585 --> 11:16.066
and you've got
some pretty hefty fines.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.678
All in all, this is what
you're looking at.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.898
I can't afford this.

11:21.942 --> 11:23.857
I can't afford
a tenth of this.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.728
Please, it's her shelter.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.774
It's way beyond my powers, son.
I'm sorry.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.863
But I got you
a guaranteed space

11:29.906 --> 11:31.299
at the Third Street
Rescue House.

11:31.342 --> 11:33.301
I have an officer
bringing your things over

11:33.344 --> 11:35.738
from the impound lot, and they'd
be happy to drive you downtown

11:35.782 --> 11:37.218
if that's, you know,
something you'd want.

11:37.261 --> 11:38.610
Thank you.Mm-hmm.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.743
Is there a place that I
can wait for my things?

11:40.787 --> 11:42.745
Yeah, absolutely.JP:
No, no. Okay?

11:42.789 --> 11:44.312
She needs her car,

11:44.355 --> 11:46.096
not a bed
in some random mission.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.925
Knock it off, JP.Look, I get
that you tried,

11:48.969 --> 11:51.188
but it's not good enough.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.281
It's okay. Come on.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.457
It's fine.

11:59.501 --> 12:00.676
Come on.

Got some very insistent

12:03.810 --> 12:05.115

12:05.159 --> 12:06.900
LUCA:
Okay, thanks, Sallen.

12:06.943 --> 12:09.641
So, you guys saw the abducted
boy we're looking for?

12:09.685 --> 12:11.078
Been trying to tell
the right person all day.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.254
We saw the kid
and the truck he was taken in.

12:13.297 --> 12:14.821
Uh, unfortunately,
we already found that vehicle

12:14.864 --> 12:16.083
abandoned in the hills.Yeah.

12:16.126 --> 12:18.259
Off Nichols Canyon Road?
We were working

12:18.302 --> 12:20.217
up there last night,
filmed the whole thing.

12:20.261 --> 12:22.176
So you got the kidnappers on
tape? Let's have a look, bud.

12:22.219 --> 12:24.134
Ooh. Uh, terms first.

12:24.178 --> 12:26.006
No, that's not how it works.
We're the LAPD.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.616
We can subpoena it.

12:27.659 --> 12:30.140
You could, if you want
to wait hours to see this.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.752
Seriously?See, we're part of a
news-gathering organization,

12:32.795 --> 12:34.492
not required by law to help.

12:34.536 --> 12:36.277
But we are
willing to.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.713
Just want a little quid
for our quo.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.715
There's a kidnapped kid
out there.All we're after

12:39.759 --> 12:42.849
are the LAPD's incident logbooks
for June 10, 2016.

12:42.892 --> 12:43.980
What for?

12:44.024 --> 12:45.416
That's our business.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.896
We got a deal or what?

12:48.898 --> 12:50.813
Okay, look, if
the video's useful,

12:50.857 --> 12:53.729
we get you the logbook
but a redacted version.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.775
Okay. Thanks.

in another car.

from the kids at the party, man.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.311
We can't see the
plate on that SUV.

13:12.356 --> 13:14.445
What are you doing?

13:14.489 --> 13:15.925
That's a plate. All right,
I'll put out a BOLO.

13:15.969 --> 13:17.492
All right, I guess
I'm arranging for those dudes

13:17.535 --> 13:19.494
to get a look at the logbook.All right.

13:19.537 --> 13:20.843
Yeah.

13:35.902 --> 13:38.513
We have more creeping on Zane.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.515
Here's a copy of the kid's
birth certificate.

13:40.558 --> 13:43.039
Uh, weird. He wasn't born
Zane Coleman. He's Zane Fuller.

13:43.083 --> 13:45.433
Looks like his mother's
maiden name. No father listed.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.219
CHRIS:
Weirder. That's Powell,

13:49.263 --> 13:52.135
and this is Leah Coleman,
Zane's mother.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.050
And they look pretty legit.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.312
MARK:
No, I am not

13:55.356 --> 13:57.706
Zane's biological father.

13:57.749 --> 14:01.014
I adopted him when he was three,
after Leah and I got married.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.667
I take it she never
mentioned Powell.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.234
No, Leah never talked
about Zane's bio-dad,

14:04.278 --> 14:06.715
and as far as I know,

14:06.758 --> 14:09.761
he was out of the picture
before Zane was even born.

14:09.805 --> 14:11.676
I just can't...
I believe that...

14:11.720 --> 14:13.461
Well, this explains
Powell's obsession.

14:13.504 --> 14:14.897
He was tracking his son.Then he got

14:14.941 --> 14:16.377
a couple of buddies to help him
take his family back.

14:16.420 --> 14:17.682
CHRIS:
Abducting him

14:17.726 --> 14:19.336
seems pretty extreme
for a custody battle.

14:19.380 --> 14:21.077
I have to believe
he tried reaching out

14:21.121 --> 14:22.252
some other way first.

14:22.296 --> 14:23.688
FAA got in touch with Leah.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.255
I'm gonna have them patch me
through to her plane,

14:25.299 --> 14:26.778
ask some new questions.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.130
You got something new on Powell?DEACON: More like I'm
developing a theory,

14:30.173 --> 14:31.740
but just go with me
for a second.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.176
So, according to his records,
Powell attended

14:33.220 --> 14:34.874
one of the largest
high schools in Chicago.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.137
He followed that up by
going to one of the biggest

14:37.180 --> 14:39.748
undergrad programs in the
country, University of Illinois.

14:39.791 --> 14:43.404
But he doesn't appear in any
yearbooks or club rosters.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.278
It's an old Witness Protection
trick, right?

14:48.322 --> 14:51.238
Yep.
Falsify degrees
from institutions so large,

14:51.281 --> 14:52.892
any one student
looks anonymous.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.894
Nobody questions if he
ever went to school there.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.331
And that gives him motive.
17 years ago,

14:57.374 --> 14:58.810
if Powell went into
Witness Protection

14:58.854 --> 15:00.508
and Leah didn't
go with him...

15:00.551 --> 15:02.727
Courts would've granted full
custody of their child to her.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.686
And then he's out in
the cold and all alone.

15:04.729 --> 15:06.949
He lays low for a minute,
and then follows them to L.A.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.951
and sees his son
being raised by a new father.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.997
Powell's got no problem
burning his WITSEC I.D.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.476
He's got the connections,

anything to her,

wanted us to save him.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.574
So Powell's not the kidnapper,
he's a victim

18:17.618 --> 18:19.098
and another hostage.LUCA:
Crew is using

18:19.141 --> 18:20.925
his kid as leverage,
coercing him, man.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.927
To do what?
Who are they?

18:22.971 --> 18:24.755
That's what we got
to figure out.HICKS: I got a deputy

18:24.799 --> 18:26.279
U.S. Marshal in my office
who might

18:26.322 --> 18:27.758
be able to fill in some details.

18:27.802 --> 18:30.500
Deacon, Chris, meet me
in the situation room.

18:32.154 --> 18:35.288
Officers, this is Elena Reid,
Powell's WITSEC handler.

18:35.331 --> 18:37.551
Bernard, bring up Powell
and Cassata's crew.

18:37.594 --> 18:40.423
17 years ago, Joel Powell
was Quinn Burnett.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.208
He was a member
of an anti-war group,

18:42.251 --> 18:44.123
called itself the
Deliverance Accord.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.125
The Accord's protests
were initially nonviolent,

18:46.168 --> 18:48.779
until Powell's college roommate
Damian Cassata took the reins.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.477
He figured more casualties
meant more attention.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.174
And Powell was the bomb builder?

18:52.218 --> 18:54.437
Yes, but he didn't have the
stomach for blowing people up.

18:54.481 --> 18:56.787
Turned state's evidence,
told us about the group's plot

18:56.831 --> 18:58.572
to attack
a hotel conference hall

18:58.615 --> 19:00.791
and was the key witness
against his conspirators.

19:00.835 --> 19:02.315
Probably saved
hundreds of lives.

19:02.358 --> 19:05.318
But put a target
on his back.

19:05.361 --> 19:09.365
Cassata, Lars Greer,
Pierce Felton all got 12 to 18.

19:09.409 --> 19:12.934
Cassata took it personal, openly
threatened Powell in court.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.544
So Powell enrolled in WITSEC.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.198
His pregnant girlfriend
didn't want to go with him?

19:16.242 --> 19:17.939
Ah, Leah didn't want to leave
her friends and family.

19:17.982 --> 19:20.202
It's a big ask
for partners and spouses.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.857
So, Powell lost her
and his unborn son.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.859
Only way to have a
relationship with his family

19:24.902 --> 19:26.426
is to watch from a distance.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.602
REID:
Fast-forward to now.
Cassata and a few other

19:28.645 --> 19:30.691
Accord members got out of prison
a few months ago.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.040
So, Powell's
hidden by WITSEC,

19:32.083 --> 19:33.868
and Damian must have
tracked down Leah.

19:33.911 --> 19:36.436
Then found Zane. Realized the
kid was the perfect motivator

19:36.479 --> 19:38.220
to make Powell
do what they want.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.744
Any chance that they're looking
to restart their agenda now?

19:40.788 --> 19:42.311
They would go after
a political target,

19:42.355 --> 19:44.226
something with a lot of
potential for collateral damage.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.097
I'll have threat assessment
draw up some possible targets,

19:46.141 --> 19:47.316
alert unis around the city.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.147
STREET:
Hey.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.323
Lab's taking inventory
on what was stolen.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.020
We should hear back
from them soon.
Okay.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.761
But get this. Those
tipsters from earlier?

19:57.805 --> 19:59.894
Yeah, I was just about
to tell them I fast-tracked

19:59.937 --> 20:01.548
their records request.I was looking into them.

20:01.591 --> 20:04.072
LUCA:
What is that? Is that a UFO?

20:04.115 --> 20:05.378
They aren't journalists.

20:05.421 --> 20:08.946
They're conspiracy
theory YouTubers.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.948
You lied.

20:10.992 --> 20:13.342
Uh, we recontextualized.

20:13.386 --> 20:14.996
Technically,
we do report information

20:15.039 --> 20:18.217
to five million subscribers.Five million?

20:18.260 --> 20:20.001
ERIC:
Requests take months
for civilians.

20:20.044 --> 20:22.003
Can't blame us for spotting an
opportunity to use a shortcut.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.787
STREET:
What do you guys want
with the logs anyway?

20:23.831 --> 20:26.399
I mean,
what happened back in 2016?

20:28.139 --> 20:30.141
On the night of
June 10, 2016,

20:30.185 --> 20:32.274
I was crashing at Ira's,
and we saw it.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.624
Just hanging there
in the night sky,

20:34.668 --> 20:36.539
our first unidentified
flying object.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.149
IRA:
We started looking
into close encounters

20:38.193 --> 20:39.977
for folks all over the country.

20:40.021 --> 20:43.024
But viewers want the details
of our origin story.

20:43.067 --> 20:44.417
ERIC:
And we didn't know
how to prove what we'd seen.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.027
Then we thought,

20:46.070 --> 20:47.376
the ship was huge,
and it was hovering

20:47.420 --> 20:48.638
over the city for
six full minutes.

20:48.682 --> 20:50.249
STREET:
So you figure,

20:50.292 --> 20:52.729
other people must have seen it,
and if someone called 911,

20:52.773 --> 20:55.036
that'd back
your story.

20:55.079 --> 20:57.560
You guys know there's
no such thing as UFOs, right?

20:57.604 --> 21:00.041
[laughs]
Tell that to the Navy

21:00.084 --> 21:02.609
and their cockpit videos
that just got declassified.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.263
What we saw that night
was oblong

21:04.306 --> 21:06.221
and defied physics
as we know it.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.875
It's what made us start
our YouTube channel,

21:07.918 --> 21:10.747
exposing the things the
government tries to keep hidden.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.358
There's one problem, fellas--

21:12.401 --> 21:14.185
SWAT's not in the paranormal
investigation business.

21:14.229 --> 21:15.578
Hey, we made a deal.

21:15.622 --> 21:18.929
If our video was useful,
we get the logbook.

21:18.973 --> 21:21.410
Can you honestly say
it didn't help you?

21:22.629 --> 21:23.847
[sighs]

21:23.891 --> 21:25.109
[knocking]

21:27.590 --> 21:29.200
These are your personal effects.Ah.

21:29.244 --> 21:32.465
Thank you.Could you give us a minute?

21:35.337 --> 21:37.252
You don't have to
stay at the shelter,

21:37.296 --> 21:39.515
but wherever you decide
to have them take you,

21:39.559 --> 21:41.604
please be safe.

21:41.648 --> 21:44.128
[sighs]: Um... I-I wanted
to tell you that JP knows

21:44.172 --> 21:47.523
that the mission houses
have restrictions, curfews.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.133
I mean, they're
to keep people safe,

21:49.177 --> 21:52.398
but I work in deliveries,
late shift.

21:52.441 --> 21:55.139
Oh. So it's hard to stay
there and keep your job.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.532
Yes.I got it.

21:56.576 --> 21:59.709
And JP said what he said
because he's protective.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.407
A kind neighbor.

22:01.450 --> 22:04.235
Started parking my car
on his street six months ago.

22:04.279 --> 22:06.803
He brings me takeout every week.

22:06.847 --> 22:08.849
We have dinner.

22:08.892 --> 22:10.938
He never told me
any of that.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.811
Commander,
I don't know you very well,

22:14.855 --> 22:17.814
but it seems like
the two of you are...

22:17.858 --> 22:20.774
so worried
about scaring each other away...

22:22.297 --> 22:24.125
...you don't really talk.

22:40.446 --> 22:44.014
Please. He's a kid.
He didn't do anything to you.

22:44.058 --> 22:46.408
You and I were gonna
change the world, remember?

22:46.452 --> 22:49.368
This time, I'm not foolish
enough to care about that.

22:49.411 --> 22:50.978
I'm the one you want.
Let Zane go.

22:54.329 --> 22:55.635
Does he know?

22:59.552 --> 23:01.945
[chuckles softly]

23:01.989 --> 23:03.947
He doesn't.

23:03.991 --> 23:06.254
Let me introduce you.

23:07.908 --> 23:10.084
This lying, worthless coward
is your father.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.219
There's a dozen events
all over town

23:15.263 --> 23:16.656
the Accord might be targeting,

23:16.699 --> 23:19.136
and who knows
how many we're not thinking of.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.182
First, Powell needs to
finish their bombs.

23:21.225 --> 23:23.750
Lab took stock--
in addition to the RDX,

23:23.793 --> 23:26.927
they also took binding
materials and tributyl citrate.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.450
They're gonna build Semtex.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.278
Look, it matches the Accord's
plan from 17 years ago.

23:30.321 --> 23:31.801
I mean, it's ironic,

23:31.845 --> 23:33.673
using military explosives
to protest a war.

23:33.716 --> 23:35.152
Cassata still has
two hostages,

23:35.196 --> 23:36.806
one of them a kid.
Any good news?

23:36.850 --> 23:38.242
To mix the plasticizer,

23:38.286 --> 23:39.548
Powell needs
a high-temperature furnace.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.420
Okay, we narrowed
down the options.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.639
This is a glassworks
in the Arts District.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.728
The area's too busy
for people trying to lay low.

23:45.772 --> 23:48.122
USC's med school has one,
but it's a good distance

23:48.165 --> 23:50.429
from the places
we know the Accord's been.

23:50.472 --> 23:53.562
Which leaves this factory,
abandoned six months ago.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.956
Unclear if the furnace
is even still there.

23:55.999 --> 23:57.827
That's a good location.
Minimal onlookers.

23:57.871 --> 23:59.438
Round up 20 squads.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.440
You're gonna have to take
a new armored vehicle.

24:01.483 --> 24:03.659
Try not to get this one
blown up.

24:05.574 --> 24:07.446
♪

24:30.164 --> 24:31.731
There's a furnace here.

24:31.774 --> 24:33.123
It's still warm.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.951
Got bomb-building materials,
not a lot else.

24:34.995 --> 24:37.301
Definitely used this place
as their home base.

24:38.694 --> 24:41.001
[rustling nearby]

24:41.044 --> 24:42.306
Hold.

24:42.350 --> 24:43.743
This is 20-David.

24:43.786 --> 24:46.136
I'm hearing activity
in the northeast corner.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.533
MAN:
Help!

24:51.577 --> 24:52.839
LAPD!

24:52.882 --> 24:55.494
It's Powell.
They left him behind.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.017
Are you alone?Uh-huh.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.192
All right,
we're coming down.

25:00.890 --> 25:02.631
We've got Powell.

25:02.675 --> 25:04.807
They got him strapped
to an explosive device.

25:04.851 --> 25:06.635
This is 20-David.
Everybody out of the building,

25:06.679 --> 25:07.854
and call the bomb squad.

25:07.897 --> 25:09.812
DEACON:
Running out of time here.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.858
There's fail-safes everywhere.
Leave me. They still have Zane.

25:11.901 --> 25:13.599
No, we got to get you
out of here first.

25:13.642 --> 25:15.383
Now, you built this thing.
How do we beat it?

25:15.426 --> 25:16.689
There isn't enough time
to disarm it safely.

25:16.732 --> 25:18.429
Hold on. It's Semtex, right?

25:18.473 --> 25:20.562
So there's got to be
a detonator charge somewhere?Yeah.

25:20.606 --> 25:23.173
Where are you thinking, Deac?If we put the whole vest
in water,

25:23.217 --> 25:24.435
would that disperse the charge?

25:24.479 --> 25:26.655
Short it out
without detonating the bomb?

25:26.699 --> 25:28.135
I don't know.
It might.

25:28.178 --> 25:29.571
This is 20-David.
I need water.

25:29.615 --> 25:30.920
A tub, a tank, anything.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.705
Utilities haven't
run here in months.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.576
There's bottled water
with the emergency supplies.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.404
What about bottled water?No.

25:36.447 --> 25:38.624
Just getting it wet could close
the circuit and set it off.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.582
Negative. It's got to be
fully submerged.

25:40.626 --> 25:43.629
If this doesn't work, you need
to know I built two vests.

25:43.672 --> 25:45.587
Damian said the other
one's for Zane.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.633
We're gonna get you
through this.DEACON: Tan,

25:47.676 --> 25:48.982
I need some good news.

25:49.025 --> 25:50.461
[panting]:
Save Zane.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.202
And will you
tell him I...

25:52.246 --> 25:54.030
I wanted so badly to know him.

25:54.074 --> 25:55.771
I'm sorry I never got
to be his father.

25:55.815 --> 25:57.077
HONDO:
No, hey, hey,
listen to me.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.687
We are gonna get you
out of this.

25:58.731 --> 25:59.862
Just help us help you.

25:59.906 --> 26:01.385
You're gonna see your son again.

26:01.429 --> 26:03.083
TAN: I got a fountain
on the three side--

26:03.126 --> 26:04.475
not clean, but it's full.

26:04.519 --> 26:05.955
All right, let's get him
out of here.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.435
Easy.
Let's go.

26:07.478 --> 26:09.089
Carry him slowly,
slowly, slowly.

26:12.701 --> 26:13.876
Over there,
over there.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.399
It's about four and a half deep.

26:15.443 --> 26:16.749
All right, good.
Get some distance.

26:17.750 --> 26:18.838
Go, Deac.

26:18.881 --> 26:20.404
Throw him now.

26:31.415 --> 26:34.070
[panting]

26:34.114 --> 26:35.898
20-David. We're clear.

26:35.942 --> 26:36.943
Bomb's deactivated.

26:40.990 --> 26:42.339
Powell wasn't
supposed to survive,

26:42.383 --> 26:44.254
so the Accord didn't hide
their plans from him.

26:44.298 --> 26:46.605
They intend to hit the First
River Bank on Hill Street,

26:46.648 --> 26:47.910
then skip town
via charter plane.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.129
I thought these guys
were political.

26:49.172 --> 26:50.783
Why switch
to a straight cash grab?

26:50.826 --> 26:52.611
According to Powell,
Cassata ranted a lot

26:52.654 --> 26:54.264
about what
the world owes him.

26:54.308 --> 26:56.266
Sounds like he lost
his ideals in prison.

26:56.310 --> 26:57.920
It's all about
revenge and profit now.

26:57.964 --> 27:00.488
Putting the bomb on Zane
and sending him into the bank

27:00.531 --> 27:02.490
covers both bases,
and it provides a diversion

27:02.533 --> 27:04.318
while the Accord
makes a run for it.

27:04.361 --> 27:05.798
All right, we'll connect
with the airfield,

27:05.841 --> 27:08.148
shut down any chance
to get out of L.A.

27:08.191 --> 27:09.497
Cassata can't
know what's up.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.151
If they even start
to feel cornered,

27:11.194 --> 27:12.326
he'll detonate that vest,

27:12.369 --> 27:13.806
killing Zane and
anyone near him.

27:13.849 --> 27:15.024
Not on our watch.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.507
Let me come with
you to save Zane.Can't do that.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.668
Yeah, I mean, maybe if
we work on her together.

39:28.278 --> 39:30.280
All right. Yeah.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.327
I'll be in touch.

39:34.459 --> 39:35.938
Thanks, Dad.

39:37.462 --> 39:39.333
You're welcome.

39:46.427 --> 39:48.429
It's like, when you
from the hood like I'm from,

39:48.473 --> 39:50.823
you never expect to see success,
at least not like this.

39:50.866 --> 39:54.435
You know? But if you keep your
head down and your heart up,

39:54.479 --> 39:57.264
keep pushing through,
you can make it, too.

39:58.787 --> 40:02.574
Okay. One final thing
before we wrap up.

40:02.617 --> 40:06.578
FarKrai, you've gone
through a lot of phases,

40:06.621 --> 40:08.449
worked to be more
of a role model.

40:08.493 --> 40:11.321
Has it been difficult
still being

40:11.365 --> 40:13.846
so close with people
from your past

40:13.889 --> 40:16.152
who maybe haven't
made that effort,

40:16.196 --> 40:17.415
haven't changed?

40:17.458 --> 40:18.720
FARKRAI:
Look, there's
a lot of stuff

40:18.764 --> 40:20.113
in my life
I'm not proud of.

40:20.156 --> 40:23.159
I got homeys
who still do dirt.

40:23.203 --> 40:25.031
And loyalty's important.

40:25.074 --> 40:26.467
But I love y'all.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.296
I love South L.A.

40:29.339 --> 40:31.080
And if building
a brighter future

40:31.124 --> 40:33.300
means sometimes I got
to leave my past alone,

40:33.343 --> 40:35.650
I hope y'all can learn
from the mistakes that I made,

40:35.694 --> 40:37.609
as much as the things
that I do right.

40:37.652 --> 40:39.132
You feel me?

40:39.175 --> 40:40.916
Thank you so much
for being here, FarKrai.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.352
It's all love.
It's all love.

40:42.396 --> 40:44.093
Let's give him a
round of applause.

40:45.921 --> 40:48.533
All right, come up,
get some autographs. Slowly.Oh, oh, oh.

40:58.151 --> 40:59.544
Hey.

40:59.587 --> 41:01.110
Hi.

41:01.154 --> 41:04.592
I didn't catch most
of that, but...

41:04.636 --> 41:06.986
I'm gonna hold him
to that last answer.

41:11.860 --> 41:14.297
Nichelle...

41:14.341 --> 41:16.822
I'm sorry.

41:16.865 --> 41:19.825
Me feeling strongly about
something is no excuse

41:19.868 --> 41:21.827
not to respect your opinion.

41:23.568 --> 41:26.353
It was wrong of me
to ask you to stay away.

41:26.396 --> 41:28.181
Mm.

41:28.224 --> 41:30.618
That feels so good to hear.

41:30.662 --> 41:33.795
There isn't anyone else that
I would rather disagree with.

41:33.839 --> 41:35.536
[chuckles softly]

41:42.456 --> 41:45.415
You know what I'm
thinking right about now?

41:45.459 --> 41:47.417
That you're gonna
help me lay out snacks

41:47.461 --> 41:49.550
and lemonade for these kids?

41:49.594 --> 41:51.552
You read my mind.

41:51.596 --> 41:53.946
