03:25.665 --> 03:27.531
Hi. You've reached Nikki.

03:27.532 --> 03:30.667
If you cannot leave a message, you
better have something good to say!

03:31.766 --> 03:35.564
Hey. It's me.

03:35.565 --> 03:38.198
I'm about to go into Alice's.

03:38.199 --> 03:42.298
If you want to stop by
after work, please do.

03:42.299 --> 03:45.365
It'd be great to see you.

03:45.366 --> 03:48.498
If not, I will see you tomorrow.

03:48.499 --> 03:50.098
Okay.

03:50.099 --> 03:51.199
Bye.

04:00.999 --> 04:02.066
Hey!

04:03.099 --> 04:04.664
Look at you.

04:04.665 --> 04:06.132
Where's Nik?

04:06.133 --> 04:08.232
She's at work, but she might
stop by later, though.

04:08.233 --> 04:09.564
Okay.

04:09.565 --> 04:11.333
Single girl tonight, then, hmm?

04:12.632 --> 04:13.898
Come on. Let's get us a drink.

04:13.899 --> 04:15.365
What are you having?

04:15.366 --> 04:16.964
I think you've already had enough.

04:16.966 --> 04:18.232
Oh, hush, hush.

04:18.233 --> 04:22.000
Come on. What are you having?
Just get me a beer.

04:24.333 --> 04:25.801
All right.

04:52.099 --> 04:53.633
Hey, Sam.

04:55.099 --> 04:56.898
Hey.

04:56.899 --> 04:57.931
Riley.

04:57.932 --> 04:59.098
Yeah. Yeah.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.431
I didn't expect to see you here.

05:00.432 --> 05:03.564
I thought Alice said you
might not be coming.

05:03.565 --> 05:05.631
Yeah, it was a last-minute thing.

05:05.632 --> 05:07.065
Cool.

05:07.066 --> 05:08.965
Can I get you a drink?

05:08.966 --> 05:09.998
Oh, no, no.

05:09.999 --> 05:11.898
Alice just went to
get me something.

05:11.899 --> 05:13.965
Okay. Oh, of course.

05:13.966 --> 05:16.298
I'm sorry.

05:16.299 --> 05:17.931
For what?

05:17.932 --> 05:22.102
For... assuming, um...

05:23.066 --> 05:25.165
Hey. It's okay.

05:25.166 --> 05:27.098
It's not a big deal.

05:27.099 --> 05:30.664
So are you still
seeing that bartender?

05:30.665 --> 05:32.731
I'm gonna run to the
bathroom really quick.

05:32.732 --> 05:34.033
Sorry.

05:37.766 --> 05:39.367
'Cause who cares?

05:40.532 --> 05:41.731
Like, pick me up, you know?

05:41.732 --> 05:43.165
Oh, sorry. Hold on.

05:43.166 --> 05:44.698
Sam.

05:44.699 --> 05:46.132
Hey.

05:46.133 --> 05:48.698
Zain.
What's up?

05:48.699 --> 05:49.731
Nothing.

05:49.732 --> 05:52.098
It's been... a long time.

05:52.099 --> 05:54.464
You been good?

05:54.465 --> 05:55.531
Yeah.

05:55.532 --> 05:57.132
I'm trying to.

05:57.133 --> 05:58.564
Uh...

05:58.565 --> 06:00.133
where's Nik?

06:04.999 --> 06:06.332
Is that-did I say...

06:06.333 --> 06:09.165
Sorry.
Did I say something weird?

06:09.166 --> 06:10.298
No.

06:10.299 --> 06:11.831
You know what?
It's fine.

06:11.832 --> 06:13.033
Forget it.

06:14.366 --> 06:15.533
Okay.

06:18.066 --> 06:21.765
'Cause I'm about to go to the
bathroom, if you need a bump.

06:21.766 --> 06:25.567
I'm good.
It'll help.

06:27.099 --> 06:28.365
Thanks.

06:28.366 --> 06:29.531
Really.

06:29.532 --> 06:30.831
All right.

06:30.832 --> 06:32.300
Well, let me know.

06:46.799 --> 06:49.498
Do you need some help with that?

06:49.499 --> 06:51.600
I got you a drink.

06:54.966 --> 06:56.332
Oh, what is in that?

06:56.333 --> 06:58.765
Vodka.
And what else?

06:58.766 --> 07:00.765
Vodka.

07:00.766 --> 07:03.232
This isn't what I asked for.

07:03.233 --> 07:05.501
Oh, it's alcohol.
Come on. You'll love it.

07:08.532 --> 07:09.564
Shots.

07:09.565 --> 07:11.566
Come on.
Shots solve everything.

07:12.565 --> 07:14.232
I can't do two shots.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.965
Well, you're not gonna do two shots.
You're gonna do four shots.

07:16.966 --> 07:18.232
Oh, no, no, no.

07:18.233 --> 07:19.998
No, no.
I-I can't.

07:19.999 --> 07:21.065
Quick.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.531
Are you trying to get me drunk?

07:22.532 --> 07:23.699
Yes!

07:25.699 --> 07:27.132
Yes!

07:27.133 --> 07:28.765
If Nikki shows up,
she's gonna kill me.

07:28.766 --> 07:30.234
Oh, fuck her.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.900
She's not gonna show up.

07:35.499 --> 07:36.798
Alice...

07:36.799 --> 07:37.798
Drink.

07:37.799 --> 07:39.734
Come on.

07:42.266 --> 07:45.731
Just do it before
you think about it.

07:45.732 --> 07:47.332
Quick, before you think
about it, just do it.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.598
Fine.
Okay.

07:48.599 --> 07:49.933
Let's do this.

07:55.932 --> 07:57.232
Oh.

07:57.233 --> 07:59.535
Hurry before you regret
your life choices.

08:05.233 --> 08:07.399
Might as well look
elsewhere, my friend.

08:07.400 --> 08:10.803
She is no longer interested in
what our kind have to offer.

08:16.133 --> 08:17.664
Yay.

08:17.665 --> 08:20.464
Ugh.

08:20.465 --> 08:22.431
W...

08:22.432 --> 08:23.831
Uh-oh.

08:23.832 --> 08:26.464
You know, Riley's on the prowl.

08:26.465 --> 08:29.831
He can sense that the alcohol
is taking over your body.

08:29.832 --> 08:33.931
He's gonna sit there
silently, off to the side,

08:33.932 --> 08:36.164
until he senses that you've thrown

08:36.166 --> 08:38.731
all your inhibitions to the wind,

08:38.732 --> 08:40.765
and that's when he's
gonna make his move,

08:40.765 --> 08:44.232
sweeping you off of your
feet and into his bed.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.298
Oh, as if that would help.

08:46.299 --> 08:47.867
Hey, Riley.

08:49.799 --> 08:52.232
Sam says if you can eat
pussy like a lesbian,

08:52.233 --> 08:55.135
then she'll take you for a
ride in about an hour or so.

08:56.766 --> 08:58.798
Alice, what the fuck are you doing?

08:58.799 --> 09:01.098
Oh, come on.
He knows I'm kidding.

09:01.099 --> 09:03.731
Well, someone has to tell that
kid he doesn't have a chance.

09:03.732 --> 09:05.900
And you had to tell
half the party, as well.

09:06.866 --> 09:08.834
I don't know half these
people, anyways.

09:15.032 --> 09:17.198
Hi.
You've reached Nikki.

09:17.199 --> 09:18.431
If you cannot leave a message,

09:18.432 --> 09:20.198
you better have
something good to say!

09:20.199 --> 09:21.598
Beep!

09:21.599 --> 09:23.165
Hey.

09:23.166 --> 09:25.731
It's...

09:25.732 --> 09:28.332
it's almost 2:00.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.268
I guess you're not coming.

09:31.732 --> 09:35.298
I probably shouldn't
be calling you, but...

09:35.299 --> 09:37.531
I can't help it.

09:37.532 --> 09:40.031
I'm thinking of you...

09:40.032 --> 09:42.598
a lot.

09:42.599 --> 09:45.031
And...

09:45.032 --> 09:47.831
I'm not sure how much
longer I'm gonna stay.

09:47.832 --> 09:50.365
So...

09:50.366 --> 09:52.734
I guess I'll see you
in the morning.

09:53.966 --> 09:55.965
Okay.

09:55.966 --> 09:57.400
I love you.

10:09.932 --> 10:11.198
Shit!

10:11.199 --> 10:12.965
Look what you made me do.

10:12.966 --> 10:14.431
I'm so sorry.

10:14.432 --> 10:15.933
I'll help you clean that up.

10:17.266 --> 10:18.567
Here's your drink.

10:21.166 --> 10:23.265
Did I have a drink?

10:23.266 --> 10:26.132
I don't even remember
what I was doing.

10:26.133 --> 10:28.535
I'm pretty sure
I saw you holding it.

10:30.699 --> 10:32.998
Are you spying on me?

10:32.999 --> 10:34.765
I thought you looked...

10:34.766 --> 10:37.031
interesting.

10:37.032 --> 10:38.498
Interesting.

10:38.499 --> 10:40.334
Haven't heard that one before.

10:45.565 --> 10:47.965
I think I saw you earlier.

10:47.966 --> 10:49.464
You know Alice?

10:49.465 --> 10:51.232
I came here with a friend,

10:51.233 --> 10:53.198
B.J.

10:53.199 --> 10:55.065
How does your friend know Alice?

10:55.066 --> 10:57.898
I'm not sure.

10:57.899 --> 11:00.898
Is your friend a girlfriend and
you're just not saying it?

11:00.899 --> 11:02.498
No, it's not.

11:02.499 --> 11:04.498
How about you?
Are you here with anyone?

11:04.499 --> 11:06.165
No.
I'm not.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.265
Hmm.
Well, are you seeing anyone?

11:08.266 --> 11:10.431
Yeah. I am.

11:10.432 --> 11:11.933
He's a lucky guy.

11:13.099 --> 11:14.466
Girl.

11:16.199 --> 11:18.365
How long has that been going on?

11:18.366 --> 11:20.765
Me being a lesbian or me and her?

11:20.766 --> 11:22.531
Both.

11:22.532 --> 11:24.399
Same time.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.198
Both.

11:27.199 --> 11:29.098
Are you intimidated?

11:29.099 --> 11:31.031
A little.

11:31.032 --> 11:33.033
Why isn't she here
with you tonight?

11:44.400 --> 11:45.868
We should stop.

11:52.832 --> 11:54.333
I'm serious.

11:58.333 --> 11:59.433
Please?

12:04.999 --> 12:06.433
Please.

12:42.932 --> 12:45.267
Oh, holy shit.

12:58.032 --> 12:59.998
Hey, Sam. It's Nik.

12:59.999 --> 13:03.698
I got your messages last night,
and I was super busy at work,

13:03.699 --> 13:07.332
so there was no way
I was going out after.

13:07.333 --> 13:10.898
So yeah, I guess I'll just
see you when I see you.

13:10.899 --> 13:12.100
All right. Bye.

13:54.932 --> 13:56.498
It's freezing in here.

13:56.499 --> 13:57.798
You think?

13:57.799 --> 13:59.765
I was gonna turn the air on.

13:59.766 --> 14:02.265
You feel okay?

14:02.266 --> 14:03.698
What are you doing home?

14:03.699 --> 14:05.498
Well, I was on my break,

14:05.499 --> 14:08.998
and I thought I would
pick some stuff up and...

14:08.999 --> 14:10.399
You hear from the committee?

14:10.400 --> 14:13.132
Can't make them get
back to me faster.

14:13.133 --> 14:15.265
I don't know.
For 100 grand?

14:15.266 --> 14:19.069
That could use some
follow-up, I think.

14:22.565 --> 14:24.431
Can I see them?

14:24.432 --> 14:26.267
Mom.

14:28.799 --> 14:30.731
Slept in pretty late this morning.

14:30.732 --> 14:32.332
Day's getting away from you.

14:32.333 --> 14:33.731
I was out kind of late.

14:33.732 --> 14:35.132
I heard.

14:35.133 --> 14:37.531
So did the whole apartment
building when you came home.

14:37.532 --> 14:38.564
Great.

14:38.565 --> 14:40.931
Well, I'm gonna go get
ready to see Nikki.

14:40.932 --> 14:43.498
Oh, what are you two gonna do?

14:43.499 --> 14:46.201
You know, girly things.

15:09.766 --> 15:11.731
I didn't think you were coming.

15:11.732 --> 15:14.531
I said I would.

15:14.532 --> 15:16.367
Are you going somewhere cold?

15:17.899 --> 15:21.464
No, I-I think I'm
just getting sick.

15:21.465 --> 15:23.800
Or hungover.

15:27.465 --> 15:30.165
So how was work after I left?

15:30.166 --> 15:32.365
Did you get my message?

15:32.366 --> 15:33.567
Yeah.

15:42.932 --> 15:44.664
How was your lover's?

15:44.665 --> 15:45.765
Stop it.

15:45.766 --> 15:47.534
I hate when you say that.

15:50.099 --> 15:53.001
It was... okay.

15:55.699 --> 15:57.800
Did you do anything fun?

15:59.732 --> 16:01.066
No.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.299
I missed you, though.

16:14.465 --> 16:16.633
The flowers are looking good.

16:18.199 --> 16:21.365
I actually got the Dendrobium
spectabile to bloom.

16:21.366 --> 16:23.098
Oh, really?

16:23.099 --> 16:25.564
Yeah.

16:25.565 --> 16:28.000
Yeah, I think I have a
real shot at getting in.

16:29.899 --> 16:34.464
Listen, if I get accepted,
could we talk about me moving?

16:34.465 --> 16:36.765
Excuse me, but...

16:36.766 --> 16:38.467
do I know you from somewhere?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.631
I'm sorry?

16:41.632 --> 16:43.798
I've seen you around before.
What's your name?

16:43.799 --> 16:46.332
Oh, that's smooth.

16:46.333 --> 16:48.399
I'm sorry?

16:48.400 --> 16:50.365
She's not interested, mate.

16:50.366 --> 16:52.134
Sorry to tell you that.

16:53.565 --> 16:54.865
Put it this way:

16:54.866 --> 16:58.402
you're not working with the
right equipment down there.

17:07.565 --> 17:10.065
Are you done yet?

17:10.066 --> 17:12.332
Yeah.

17:12.333 --> 17:14.165
Yeah.

17:14.165 --> 17:15.967
Fucking men.

17:23.464 --> 17:25.800
Dinner is served.

17:30.565 --> 17:32.633
What are you doing?

17:34.199 --> 17:37.065
I'm gonna go sit down and eat?

17:37.066 --> 17:39.801
Tonight we're having dinner
sitting at the table.

17:41.199 --> 17:43.298
I'm not 12.

17:43.299 --> 17:46.531
My roof, my rules.
Sit.

17:46.532 --> 17:48.931
You know, I'm not gonna
be here much longer.

17:48.932 --> 17:50.198
Then while you're here,

17:50.199 --> 17:52.434
we're going to act like a family.

17:59.966 --> 18:01.631
I can go get a hotel.

18:01.632 --> 18:03.098
Why would you do that?

18:03.099 --> 18:05.198
So I don't have to put up
with these ridiculous rules.

18:05.199 --> 18:07.598
You and your roommate never
sat at the dinner table

18:07.599 --> 18:08.765
and had dinner together?

18:08.766 --> 18:10.334
My roommate?

18:12.032 --> 18:13.900
Humor me.

18:15.233 --> 18:16.531
No.

18:16.532 --> 18:18.265
We didn't.

18:18.266 --> 18:20.531
As you can imagine, we're
not your ordinary couple.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.431
That's what this is about.

18:22.432 --> 18:24.934
It's a part of not being ordinary.

18:25.899 --> 18:27.498
Watch that.

18:27.499 --> 18:29.631
I've been here ten days, and
you're already driving me nuts.

18:29.632 --> 18:31.298
So where are you gonna go?
A hotel?

18:31.299 --> 18:32.765
That'll last you a couple of weeks.

18:32.766 --> 18:33.965
That's all I need.

18:33.966 --> 18:37.198
That's what you said when you got here.
Your two weeks is coming up fast.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.464
Everything's gonna work out.

18:38.465 --> 18:39.798
We had a really good time today.

18:39.799 --> 18:41.598
And what if it doesn't?
What's your plan?

18:41.599 --> 18:43.298
Get my own place.
With what money?

18:43.299 --> 18:44.898
With the money I get
from the flowers.

18:44.899 --> 18:46.698
You haven't been following up.

18:46.699 --> 18:48.232
How do you know
you're gonna get in?

18:48.233 --> 18:50.098
You know what?
I don't want to talk about this.

18:50.099 --> 18:51.600
Thanks for dinner.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.365
Oh!
You okay?

18:55.366 --> 18:57.198
Um... yeah.

18:57.199 --> 18:58.965
It's... just cramps.

18:58.966 --> 19:00.165
You sure?

19:00.166 --> 19:02.065
I'm gonna lie down.

19:02.066 --> 19:03.365
Do you need anything?

19:03.366 --> 19:04.867
I'll be fine.

19:50.266 --> 19:51.767
Fuck.

21:05.032 --> 21:07.098
Shit! Oh!

21:07.099 --> 21:09.200
Oh, shit!

21:11.233 --> 21:12.498
Shit, shit, shit!

21:12.499 --> 21:15.031
Are you making breakfast?
Oh!

21:15.032 --> 21:16.065
What happened?

21:16.066 --> 21:18.564
Oh, I burned my hand
on that damn coffeepot.

21:18.565 --> 21:20.065
Are you cooking something?

21:20.066 --> 21:21.898
No. Why?

21:21.899 --> 21:23.533
No reason.

21:24.499 --> 21:27.431
I'm fine, if you were wondering.

21:27.432 --> 21:29.265
Shit.
Sorry.

21:29.266 --> 21:30.431
Let me help you.

21:30.432 --> 21:31.799
Thanks.

21:33.333 --> 21:34.731
When are you going in?

21:34.732 --> 21:37.000
I'm gonna leave here in a minute.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.265
You can keep it.

21:42.266 --> 21:43.531
I have more at work.

21:43.532 --> 21:45.098
You slept in this morning.

21:45.099 --> 21:47.298
You feeling okay?

21:47.299 --> 21:49.165
Don't even start with that.

21:49.166 --> 21:52.031
It's my job.
Not looking very well.

21:52.032 --> 21:53.199
Thanks, Mom.

22:01.999 --> 22:03.332
How are you feeling?

22:03.333 --> 22:04.531
Fucking awful.

22:04.532 --> 22:06.865
I've never had a hangover
that lasts more than a day.

22:06.866 --> 22:07.898
That's good.

22:07.899 --> 22:10.668
It means the alcohol is
cleansing you of your stress.

22:11.699 --> 22:13.367
Hey, hold on.

22:16.665 --> 22:18.631
Never mind. It can wait.

22:18.632 --> 22:20.965
Ignoring her calls, huh?
Big one?

22:20.966 --> 22:22.399
Shut up.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.765
So did you get my text messages?

22:24.766 --> 22:27.034
Fuck, I forgot to check them.
What's going on?

22:28.032 --> 22:30.399
I've had the worst fucking morning.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.998
I woke up to the fucking cops
at my house this morning.

22:32.999 --> 22:35.332
What? Are you serious?
Yeah.

22:35.333 --> 22:36.531
Well, what for?

22:36.532 --> 22:37.798
They're looking for some guy

22:37.799 --> 22:40.034
who was at my house
a couple nights ago.

22:41.299 --> 22:42.898
No way. Who?

22:42.899 --> 22:46.399
I don't know.
Some guy named Brent Jaffe.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.298
Well, did they say why?

22:48.299 --> 22:50.431
No, and they were being
really weird about it.

22:50.432 --> 22:54.332
They wouldn't say much about it, just that
if I talked to anyone that knew anything

22:54.333 --> 22:55.433
to give them a call.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.598
So... do you know anything?

22:58.599 --> 23:01.232
No, I don't.
That's crazy.

23:01.233 --> 23:02.765
Hope it's nothing serious.

23:02.766 --> 23:04.564
Well, it was serious enough

23:04.565 --> 23:07.132
for the cops to
fucking wake me up.

23:07.133 --> 23:09.132
No more randoms at my house.

23:09.133 --> 23:10.898
I don't care how hot they are.

23:10.899 --> 23:12.698
Did they show you a
picture or anything?

23:12.699 --> 23:14.365
Yeah, but I didn't recognize him.

23:14.366 --> 23:16.898
I was so fucked up that night.

23:16.899 --> 23:19.198
Well, is anything missing
from your place?

23:19.199 --> 23:20.232
Mo.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.411
I'm, like, going through
everything right now, but...

23:23.099 --> 23:24.464
I don't think so.

23:24.465 --> 23:27.731
Well, listen, I got to go into work, but
I'll call you as soon as I'm out, okay?

23:27.732 --> 23:30.067
Okay.
Bye, love.

23:56.599 --> 23:59.631
Sam, you've got someone
in your section.

23:59.632 --> 24:01.931
Okay. Thanks.

24:01.932 --> 24:04.234
Is everything okay?

24:07.266 --> 24:09.367
Yeah. I'm good.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.165
Hey, Riley.

24:24.166 --> 24:25.731
Hey.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.631
Back again, huh?

24:27.632 --> 24:29.733
Yup.
I know what I like.

24:32.166 --> 24:35.365
Listen, about the other
night at Alice's.

24:35.366 --> 24:37.031
I was not trying to...

24:37.032 --> 24:38.931
No explanation needed.

24:38.932 --> 24:41.598
And I'm sorry about
what Alice said.

24:41.599 --> 24:43.700
Oh, no, don't be.
It was funny.

24:48.032 --> 24:49.831
So you want the usual?

24:49.832 --> 24:52.668
Yeah.
I...

24:57.299 --> 25:00.098
Hey, can you switch
sections with me?

25:00.099 --> 25:01.667
Yeah. Sure.

25:11.233 --> 25:12.898
Hey.
How you guys doing?

25:12.899 --> 25:14.065
Fine. How are you?
Good.

25:14.066 --> 25:15.664
Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

25:15.665 --> 25:17.098
What can I get you to drink?

25:17.099 --> 25:19.034
I'll have a glass of
chardonnay, please.

25:28.099 --> 25:29.564
I'm sorry.
What was that?

25:29.565 --> 25:32.534
Glass of...
Chardonnay, please.

25:42.766 --> 25:44.431
A-and for you, ma'am?

25:44.432 --> 25:45.833
I'll have...

25:53.632 --> 25:55.965
I'm gonna get you some water

25:55.966 --> 25:58.601
and I'll be right back
with those drinks.

26:04.966 --> 26:06.531
Hey, can you cover my table?

26:06.532 --> 26:08.834
Where are you going?
I'll be just a minute.

26:34.665 --> 26:35.965
Stop it!

26:35.966 --> 26:37.765
Stop it!

26:37.766 --> 26:38.866
Stop it!

26:39.832 --> 26:41.133
Samantha?

26:46.166 --> 26:47.734
Are you all right?

26:50.799 --> 26:53.134
Yeah, I'll be out in a second.

26:54.499 --> 26:55.766
Okay.

27:42.166 --> 27:44.399
Oh, no.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.500
Oh!

27:52.099 --> 27:53.233
Oh!

28:09.099 --> 28:10.598
Is everything okay?

28:10.599 --> 28:14.836
Yeah.
Just really bad cramps.

28:16.599 --> 28:18.500
Do you need a tampon?

28:20.032 --> 28:22.434
I'm gonna go take
care of this table.

28:32.032 --> 28:33.132
Here you go.

28:33.133 --> 28:34.300
Thank you.

28:36.099 --> 28:37.598
Are you ready to order?

28:37.599 --> 28:38.631
Yeah.

28:38.632 --> 28:39.831
Oh!

28:39.832 --> 28:41.564
Oh, my God!

28:41.565 --> 28:43.166
Are you okay?

28:45.599 --> 28:47.300
Ow.

29:03.032 --> 29:04.633
Samantha?

30:02.032 --> 30:03.765
Hello, Samantha.

30:03.766 --> 30:05.464
How are you?

30:05.465 --> 30:07.198
I'm okay.
How are you?

30:07.199 --> 30:08.265
Fine.

30:08.266 --> 30:09.564
Fine.

30:09.565 --> 30:11.967
What seems to be the problem?

30:12.999 --> 30:15.835
Well, I'm feeling kind of funny.

30:19.565 --> 30:21.066
What kind of funny?

30:23.299 --> 30:27.498
Well, this morning, I woke up,
and my stomach was killing me,

30:27.499 --> 30:29.831
and then I went to the bathroom,

30:29.832 --> 30:32.965
and there was blood...

30:32.966 --> 30:34.965
there was a lot of blood.

30:34.966 --> 30:36.898
Did you start your period?

30:36.899 --> 30:39.031
I think so.

30:39.032 --> 30:40.664
But something's wrong.

30:40.665 --> 30:43.198
It's acting up.

30:43.199 --> 30:44.466
Let's take a look.

30:50.166 --> 30:51.266
Deep breath.

30:54.199 --> 30:55.566
Again.

30:58.333 --> 31:00.101
One more time.

31:04.233 --> 31:05.467
Good.

31:09.766 --> 31:12.165
Do you have a history
of heart problems?

31:12.166 --> 31:14.498
Or anybody in your family?

31:14.499 --> 31:16.965
No. Why?

31:16.966 --> 31:20.402
Your heart rate
is unusually slow.

31:21.199 --> 31:23.531
Hmm.

31:23.532 --> 31:25.333
Hold still for me.

31:34.233 --> 31:35.634
Hold still.

31:41.732 --> 31:44.232
Okay, open wide for me.

31:44.233 --> 31:45.232
Say, "Ah."

31:45.233 --> 31:48.065
Ah.

31:48.066 --> 31:49.400
Thank you.

31:54.066 --> 31:55.731
So what is it?

31:55.732 --> 31:58.998
Well, your ear canals appear
to be getting infected.

31:58.999 --> 32:01.431
That could be a head
cold getting worse.

32:01.432 --> 32:03.831
Now, the illness may be
lowering your immune system,

32:03.832 --> 32:06.765
which may be lowering
your heart rate.

32:06.766 --> 32:09.965
But that would not explain
the vaginal bleeding.

32:09.966 --> 32:12.001
Shall we take a look?

32:14.699 --> 32:16.464
W-w...

32:16.465 --> 32:21.536
What if I told you there
was something else?

32:24.333 --> 32:27.502
I-I have a rash... down there.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.066
Lie back for me.

32:43.233 --> 32:44.731
Samantha.

32:44.732 --> 32:47.065
Samantha, are you sexually active?

32:47.066 --> 32:48.399
Why?

32:48.400 --> 32:51.232
I think you know why.

32:51.233 --> 32:52.867
I'm a lesbian.

32:55.899 --> 32:58.968
Have you ever been sexually
active with a man?

33:02.333 --> 33:04.598
I will take that as a yes.

33:04.599 --> 33:07.332
It-it was one time, last night...

33:07.333 --> 33:08.431
two nights ago.

33:08.432 --> 33:10.531
Samantha, if you're not
being truthful with me, I...

33:10.532 --> 33:12.065
I swear.
It was the other night.

33:12.066 --> 33:13.098
That's it.

33:13.099 --> 33:15.701
I haven't been with a guy
in eight months until then.

33:16.632 --> 33:18.631
Are you using protection?

33:18.632 --> 33:22.302
I don't-I don't remember
if we did the other night.

33:29.632 --> 33:33.265
Well, you definitely
have a severe rash.

33:33.266 --> 33:36.798
Lot of dead skin, chafing.

33:36.799 --> 33:38.998
Is there any discomfort?

33:38.999 --> 33:41.564
God, yes.

33:41.565 --> 33:43.564
You should apply some
moisturizing lotion

33:43.565 --> 33:45.099
when you get home tonight.

33:47.199 --> 33:48.865
What about the bleeding?

33:48.866 --> 33:53.399
Unless it's some sort of
internal bleeding or...

33:53.400 --> 33:55.232
an unknown pregnancy...

33:55.233 --> 33:58.803
I told you, I...
The other night, that's it.

34:08.732 --> 34:12.335
As far as I can tell you have
a head cold and 'a rash.

34:42.665 --> 34:44.232
Sam.

34:44.233 --> 34:46.201
I totally forgot
you were visiting.

34:47.498 --> 34:48.831
Can I come in?

34:48.831 --> 34:52.165
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

34:52.166 --> 34:55.531
You know George is gonna be
pissed at you for missing again.

34:55.532 --> 34:57.698
It was dead.
He cut me early.

34:57.699 --> 34:59.399
Oh.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.898
Good of you to stop by, then.

35:01.899 --> 35:03.433
Yeah.

35:08.166 --> 35:10.132
So how was work last night?

35:10.133 --> 35:12.098
Oh, it was fucking awful.

35:12.099 --> 35:15.399
There was this guy there that
was hitting on me all night.

35:15.400 --> 35:18.332
Actually, he reminded
me of that fellow

35:18.333 --> 35:20.332
that always comes in to see you.

35:20.333 --> 35:21.431
Riley.

35:21.432 --> 35:22.731
Yeah, that's him.

35:22.732 --> 35:23.965
I just don't understand it.

35:23.966 --> 35:26.498
It's like they know
they can't have us,

35:26.499 --> 35:28.564
so they try even harder.

35:28.565 --> 35:32.232
Finally I just told him, I said,
"I'm not gonna touch your cock."

35:32.233 --> 35:34.931
Then he ran up a $200 tab
trying to impress me.

35:34.932 --> 35:37.200
It was pathetic.

35:41.333 --> 35:43.668
Are you not feeling well?

35:45.565 --> 35:46.899
I'm okay.

35:50.233 --> 35:55.004
I don't mean to be a twat,
but you look like shit.

35:56.932 --> 35:59.498
Yeah...

35:59.499 --> 36:02.731
I think that hangover
is sticking with me.

36:02.732 --> 36:05.367
Right.

36:07.565 --> 36:10.631
Anyway, I've got your post.

36:10.632 --> 36:12.464
Oh, anything from the committee?

36:12.465 --> 36:14.065
I've been waiting to hear back.

36:14.066 --> 36:15.534
I don't know.

36:23.400 --> 36:26.332
So I got us something.

36:26.333 --> 36:28.434
Did you?

36:30.333 --> 36:33.298
Today's ten months.

36:33.299 --> 36:35.798
Oh. Right.

36:35.799 --> 36:39.098
I didn't know we were
exchanging gifts.

36:39.099 --> 36:42.101
It's kind of an odd
anniversary, right?

36:44.266 --> 36:46.098
Well, I...

36:46.099 --> 36:50.165
I just figured with everything
that's been going on,

36:50.166 --> 36:51.731
it'd be nice.

36:51.732 --> 36:53.332
Yeah.

36:53.333 --> 36:54.700
Right.

37:01.133 --> 37:03.498
The place looks nice.

37:03.499 --> 37:06.399
Happy to see you kept my stuff.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.765
Stop it.

37:07.766 --> 37:09.100
What?

37:11.400 --> 37:12.968
What?

37:14.565 --> 37:15.999
I miss you.

37:17.066 --> 37:18.567
I miss us.

37:20.532 --> 37:22.066
Don't you?

37:23.532 --> 37:24.765
Yeah.

37:24.766 --> 37:27.034
I guess.

37:28.233 --> 37:31.035
Then let it happen.

37:32.732 --> 37:34.765
You know, this is...

37:34.766 --> 37:36.601
It's all just a wee bit
too fast for me.

37:38.899 --> 37:42.201
Well, if you don't let things happen,
nothing's gonna get resolved.

37:43.899 --> 37:47.302
You know, it's good to have space.

37:52.532 --> 37:54.765
Fine.

37:54.766 --> 37:56.464
I'm gonna go meet
Alice for dinner.

37:56.465 --> 37:59.031
Oh. Dinner.

37:59.032 --> 38:00.798
Stop it.

38:00.799 --> 38:03.298
She wants to fuck you, you know.

38:03.299 --> 38:04.931
Oh, my gosh.

38:04.932 --> 38:06.498
What?
Like you're surprised?

38:06.499 --> 38:09.198
You knew about this?
Well, isn't it obvious?

38:09.199 --> 38:11.731
When did this come?

38:11.732 --> 38:14.100
Oh, that.

38:15.333 --> 38:17.334
Is that important?

38:26.465 --> 38:28.298
Hey.
Sorry I was late.

38:28.299 --> 38:30.898
Is it slow?

38:30.899 --> 38:33.265
Dude, what the hell?

38:33.266 --> 38:35.165
What?

38:35.166 --> 38:37.664
Your fucking eye.

38:37.665 --> 38:39.232
My eye?
What about it?

38:39.233 --> 38:41.501
Go to the fucking bathroom.

38:48.665 --> 38:51.434
What the fuck?

38:57.732 --> 39:00.098
Fuck.
Holy shit!

39:00.099 --> 39:01.731
Sorry. I'm sorry.

39:01.732 --> 39:03.065
I just wanted to check on you.

39:03.066 --> 39:04.399
Are you okay?

39:04.400 --> 39:07.631
Yeah, I'm...
I'm a little jumpy.

39:07.632 --> 39:11.631
What the hell is
wrong with your eye?

39:11.632 --> 39:14.564
I think there's something
caught in it or...

39:14.565 --> 39:16.767
or, like, an allergic reaction.

39:17.866 --> 39:19.065
Well...

39:19.066 --> 39:23.332
you need to get it
looked at, because...

39:23.333 --> 39:26.664
it looks super gross, man.

39:26.665 --> 39:27.998
Thanks.

39:27.999 --> 39:29.165
I'm serious.

39:29.166 --> 39:31.598
What the fuck have
you been smoking?

39:31.599 --> 39:32.765
Nothing. I...

39:32.766 --> 39:34.464
I just left Nikki's.

39:34.465 --> 39:36.965
Oh, yeah?
You guys working it out?

39:36.966 --> 39:39.464
Maybe.

39:39.465 --> 39:41.598
Great.

39:41.599 --> 39:43.531
Hey, have you heard
anything about that guy

39:43.532 --> 39:44.965
from the other night?

39:44.966 --> 39:46.399
Oh. Yeah.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.898
They put out an alert about him
on the fucking news this morning

39:48.899 --> 39:51.298
like they do with child molesters.

39:51.299 --> 39:53.467
I mean, they said he
could be dangerous.

39:55.066 --> 39:56.564
Holy shit.

39:56.565 --> 39:58.065
Yeah.

39:58.066 --> 39:59.667
Crazy.

40:02.032 --> 40:03.199
Yeah.

40:34.366 --> 40:36.134
Ow.

43:11.632 --> 43:13.467
Honey, are you okay?

43:15.333 --> 43:16.631
I'm fine.

43:16.632 --> 43:18.133
Stay back.

43:21.366 --> 43:24.132
Oh, my God.

43:24.133 --> 43:25.431
What is wrong?

43:25.432 --> 43:27.031
Be honest with me.

43:27.032 --> 43:29.400
Nothing.
I'm just sick.

43:31.732 --> 43:33.733
Are you pregnant?

43:35.766 --> 43:38.101
What's that word you
love to call me so much?

43:39.766 --> 43:41.067
Dyke?

43:44.499 --> 43:47.098
No, I'm not pregnant.

43:47.099 --> 43:49.801
Just leave me alone.

43:51.899 --> 43:53.333
Oh, yeah.

43:56.032 --> 43:57.633
I got in.

44:01.665 --> 44:03.967
I'm proud of you.

45:04.499 --> 45:07.101
What the fuck?

45:19.333 --> 45:22.498
Mom, did you use
all the hot water?

45:22.499 --> 45:24.531
What are you talking about?

45:24.532 --> 45:27.298
Did you use all the hot water?

45:27.299 --> 45:29.100
I haven't showered yet.

45:31.766 --> 45:34.098
Well, there's not any hot water.

45:34.099 --> 45:36.731
Are you kidding me?
It's like a sauna in here.

45:36.732 --> 45:38.065
Look.

45:38.066 --> 45:39.467
See? Nothing.

45:40.266 --> 45:41.998
Oh, my God!
What?

45:41.999 --> 45:43.431
Samantha!

45:43.432 --> 45:45.100
Look at your hand!

45:47.133 --> 45:49.931
I will not stand for this
in this house again.

45:49.932 --> 45:52.033
Never again.

46:57.432 --> 46:58.464
Where are you going?

46:58.465 --> 46:59.931
I'm going to the doctor.

46:59.932 --> 47:02.132
Where are you really going?
Get off my back.

47:02.133 --> 47:04.898
Honey, I ask because I care.

47:04.899 --> 47:06.564
You've been sleeping in late.

47:06.565 --> 47:07.965
You're "sick."

47:07.966 --> 47:10.698
That's how it started the last time.
This isn't last time.

47:10.699 --> 47:12.298
You don't know where the
fuck I'm going every night.

47:12.299 --> 47:14.798
I'm not this horrible person that
you think I am in your head.

47:14.799 --> 47:16.967
I didn't say you were!
You don't have to say it!

47:21.299 --> 47:23.031
What was that?

47:23.032 --> 47:25.133
What did you do?

47:27.599 --> 47:29.267
Excuse me?

47:30.665 --> 47:33.498
What are you doing to yourself?

47:33.499 --> 47:36.601
What the fuck are
you talking about?

47:39.465 --> 47:41.199
Your hair.

47:46.266 --> 47:47.500
What the...

47:52.032 --> 47:53.198
What is this?

47:53.199 --> 47:54.698
What did you do?

47:54.699 --> 47:56.600
You think I did this?

47:57.665 --> 47:58.832
Fuck!

48:01.499 --> 48:03.464
Sammy, where are you going?

48:03.465 --> 48:05.365
Come back!

48:05.366 --> 48:06.466
You...

48:07.766 --> 48:10.265
Hey. It's George.
Where are you?

48:10.266 --> 48:11.564
Fuck.
I'm sorry, George.

48:11.565 --> 48:14.365
I'm headed to the doctor and
then I have to be somewhere.

48:14.366 --> 48:17.198
The doctor?
Why didn't you ask off?

48:17.199 --> 48:19.198
This is an emergency.

48:19.199 --> 48:21.167
What, are you dying?

48:23.133 --> 48:24.365
Hello?

48:24.366 --> 48:26.965
No, but it is an emergency,
George.

48:26.966 --> 48:29.098
Listen, I heard about yesterday.

48:29.099 --> 48:30.464
I only have you on right now.

48:30.465 --> 48:34.167
I need you to come in just for a little bit
until I can get someone to replace you.

48:35.266 --> 48:37.664
Is that cool?

48:37.665 --> 48:40.664
Hello?
Hello?

48:40.665 --> 48:43.067
Yeah. Okay.
I'll be there in a minute.

48:44.499 --> 48:45.800
Fuck!

49:18.400 --> 49:20.731
Hey, Sam.

49:20.732 --> 49:22.865
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

49:22.866 --> 49:24.734
You can't wear those.

49:25.665 --> 49:27.865
I really need you to cut me
some slack here, George.

49:27.866 --> 49:32.302
I'm cutting you slack, but I can't have
you look like slack at work, get it?

49:35.299 --> 49:37.798
Holy shit.

49:37.799 --> 49:41.598
What happened?
It's pinkeye.

49:41.599 --> 49:44.564
Oh, that looks like some
really bad pinkeye.

49:44.565 --> 49:47.564
I know.
The doctor. Remember?

49:47.565 --> 49:49.898
Yeah.
You should go.

49:49.899 --> 49:51.600
I mean, you look not well.

49:56.632 --> 49:58.333
Try to squint or something.

50:07.599 --> 50:08.931
Sorry about the wait.

50:08.932 --> 50:10.900
Is there anything
else I can get you?

50:14.032 --> 50:16.232
I think we'll be okay.

50:16.233 --> 50:18.201
Great.
I will go check on your food.

50:33.866 --> 50:35.431
I got Joey coming in for you.

50:35.432 --> 50:37.767
You can take care of your
face when he gets here.

51:54.266 --> 51:56.865
Hey, Sam?

51:56.866 --> 51:59.332
Hey, Sam! Wait up!

51:59.333 --> 52:01.298
Sam!

52:01.299 --> 52:03.898
Hey, Sam! Hey.
What do you want?

52:03.899 --> 52:05.165
I was just coming in to see you.

52:05.166 --> 52:06.765
I figured you'd be working.
I got to go.

52:06.766 --> 52:10.698
Wait.
Are you okay?

52:10.699 --> 52:13.631
I'm not feeling well, okay?

52:13.632 --> 52:15.865
And you need to stop coming
to see me all the time.

52:15.866 --> 52:18.132
Do you want me to take
you to the doctor?

52:18.133 --> 52:19.931
That's not your job.

52:19.932 --> 52:22.332
I am not your problem.

52:22.333 --> 52:25.065
You're a really nice guy,
but I'm not into you.

52:25.066 --> 52:26.166
Wait.

52:31.099 --> 52:33.067
I saw you the other night.

52:34.432 --> 52:35.833
With that guy.

52:37.899 --> 52:40.466
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, you do.

52:41.866 --> 52:44.198
You know what I'm talking about.

52:44.199 --> 52:46.267
Now the cops are looking for him.

52:48.499 --> 52:50.300
Were you spying on me?

52:52.133 --> 52:55.833
Stay away from me, or I'll tell
'em about how you're stalking me.

53:16.099 --> 53:17.831
Hey, I'm in the
middle of something.

53:17.832 --> 53:20.031
Holy shit, dude.
Where have you been?

53:20.032 --> 53:22.332
I just got off work.
What's wrong?

53:22.333 --> 53:23.931
So they caught the
guy from the party,

53:23.932 --> 53:25.232
and now the police are asking me

53:25.233 --> 53:27.431
for a list of names of
anyone that was there.

53:27.432 --> 53:29.631
They're questioning anyone that's
come into contact with him.

53:29.632 --> 53:31.232
Are you serious?
Why?

53:31.233 --> 53:34.399
I don't know, but it has
to be something bad.

53:34.400 --> 53:36.132
Holy shit.

53:36.133 --> 53:38.031
I mean, he was going
by his nickname, B.J.,

53:38.032 --> 53:42.464
which is why his name didn't
sound familiar to anyone.

53:42.465 --> 53:44.433
Did you meet anyone named B.J.?

53:46.632 --> 53:48.598
I, um...

53:48.599 --> 53:49.698
What?

53:49.699 --> 53:51.698
Samantha?
What is it?

53:51.699 --> 53:53.367
I have to go.
Wait!

53:54.599 --> 53:56.132
What do you mean,
you don't know anything?

53:56.133 --> 53:58.464
We have to wait for the
results of your blood test.

53:58.465 --> 53:59.998
These things take time.

53:59.999 --> 54:01.332
I don't have time.

54:01.333 --> 54:03.401
Whatever's happening to
me is getting worse.

54:13.599 --> 54:15.332
When did this happen?

54:15.333 --> 54:17.902
Yesterday, after I left.

54:19.432 --> 54:22.731
It looks to be viral, but...

54:22.732 --> 54:25.798
there's no buildup that
would suggest infection.

54:25.799 --> 54:27.298
What does that mean?

54:27.299 --> 54:29.232
You're sure this happened
after you had sex...

54:29.233 --> 54:30.531
unprotected sex?

54:30.532 --> 54:31.766
Yes.

54:33.632 --> 54:35.498
I can't be sure until I
see the test results,

54:35.499 --> 54:40.564
but this appears to be some sort
of sexually transmitted disease.

54:40.565 --> 54:43.698
Is-is there anything
you can give me?

54:43.699 --> 54:46.031
Antibiotics? Cream?
Anything?

54:46.032 --> 54:49.198
Anything I would give you could
be had over the counter.

54:49.199 --> 54:50.431
The real treatment will happen

54:50.432 --> 54:53.534
once I can identify what this is.

54:55.699 --> 54:58.698
So what do I do?

54:58.699 --> 55:01.898
Do not come into
contact with anyone

55:01.899 --> 55:05.736
until we can determine what
it is we're dealing with.

55:29.233 --> 55:31.731
Hey.
Hi.

55:31.732 --> 55:33.198
What's up?

55:33.199 --> 55:34.998
I'm in kind of a bind.

55:34.999 --> 55:36.898
I need something to help me out.

55:36.899 --> 55:38.464
What kind of bind are you in?

55:38.465 --> 55:41.498
You need some cash?

55:41.499 --> 55:43.434
Can I just come inside?

55:45.465 --> 55:46.698
Yeah.

55:46.699 --> 55:49.265
Sure.

55:49.266 --> 55:51.731
Alice is on her way too, so...

55:51.732 --> 55:54.598
just in time.

55:54.599 --> 55:56.300
What are you looking for?

55:57.732 --> 56:00.365
Something that'll help me get
through the next 48 hours.

56:00.366 --> 56:03.399
You sound like you're
in some deep shit.

56:03.400 --> 56:05.768
Want to talk about it?

56:07.133 --> 56:09.298
No? Okay.
No worries.

56:09.299 --> 56:11.365
Here.

56:11.366 --> 56:15.165
Now, just be careful
with this stuff, okay,

56:15.166 --> 56:17.301
because it's been a while.

56:19.099 --> 56:20.400
Whew.

56:26.932 --> 56:28.566
Ah. That's Alice.

56:29.932 --> 56:31.232
Hey.

56:31.233 --> 56:32.865
No, yeah.
Just come to the front.

56:32.866 --> 56:34.934
I'll let you in.
All right.

56:54.665 --> 56:57.664
Sam?

56:57.665 --> 56:59.998
What the fuck?
What are you doing to her?

56:59.999 --> 57:01.698
What?
She came here.

57:01.699 --> 57:04.731
I've had a pretty fucked-up
last couple of days.

57:04.732 --> 57:06.466
What's going on?

57:10.333 --> 57:12.132
You know that guy,

57:12.133 --> 57:13.498
B.J.?

57:13.499 --> 57:15.200
Yeah.

57:16.899 --> 57:18.967
Well...

57:26.799 --> 57:28.399
I don't know what happened.

57:28.400 --> 57:32.098
I was at your party,
and then we were in his car

57:32.099 --> 57:35.564
and then I woke up at home.

57:35.565 --> 57:36.965
It's all a blur.

57:36.966 --> 57:38.631
Samantha, you have
to tell the police.

57:38.632 --> 57:39.965
No, I can't!

57:39.966 --> 57:42.998
You have to tell the
police what happened!

57:42.999 --> 57:44.600
That's not it.

57:48.599 --> 57:51.835
Something's been wrong with
me ever since that night.

57:53.732 --> 57:55.633
Oh, I'm way too high for that.

57:58.565 --> 58:00.098
Sam,

58:00.099 --> 58:02.399
we need to take you to the police

58:02.400 --> 58:05.232
so that you can tell
them what happened.

58:05.233 --> 58:08.298
No, I can't go to the police.
I can't let Nikki find out.

58:08.299 --> 58:11.098
Forget Nikki.
We have to think about you.

58:11.099 --> 58:12.564
You would like that,
wouldn't you?

58:12.565 --> 58:13.731
Me to forget Nikki.

58:13.732 --> 58:15.165
What are you talking about?

58:15.166 --> 58:17.198
Oh, don't act like you
haven't been waiting for us

58:17.199 --> 58:18.898
to break up since the
moment you met her.

58:18.899 --> 58:21.531
Okay.
Now I know you're high.

58:21.532 --> 58:23.232
Fuck you!
Sam!

58:23.233 --> 58:25.031
No, you don't care about
what's best for me.

58:25.032 --> 58:26.698
You care about what's best for you.

58:26.699 --> 58:29.132
If you fucking cared,
you'd help me hide this shit

58:29.133 --> 58:30.365
and not try to expose it

58:30.366 --> 58:32.334
so I can be left
with nobody but you!

58:34.565 --> 58:36.066
Samantha!

58:38.999 --> 58:40.698
Before you say anything,

58:40.699 --> 58:43.898
I may have sold roofies to a guy
named B.J. at that party.

58:43.899 --> 58:47.001
So...

58:52.599 --> 58:55.464
Thanks, Joey.
Is George here?

58:55.465 --> 58:57.731
Not right now.

58:57.732 --> 58:59.931
But if I were you,
I wouldn't stay here too long.

58:59.932 --> 59:01.600
He's pretty pissed
about the other day.

59:29.699 --> 59:31.564
Doing okay?

59:31.565 --> 59:33.265
Do you want to get out of here?

59:33.266 --> 59:34.500
Let's go.

01:00:16.732 --> 01:00:18.332
Listen, I want you to convince her

01:00:18.333 --> 01:00:20.531
that what I'm doing is
right because it is right.

01:00:20.532 --> 01:00:22.265
All right.
It is.

01:00:22.266 --> 01:00:23.431
Sammy?

01:00:23.432 --> 01:00:25.798
What are you doing home?

01:00:25.799 --> 01:00:28.198
I'm going to sign in
for the weekend.

01:00:28.199 --> 01:00:29.998
What's going on?

01:00:29.999 --> 01:00:33.431
Dr. Sullivan and I wanted
to have a talk with you.

01:00:33.432 --> 01:00:35.166
Why?

01:00:38.299 --> 01:00:39.900
Have you been drinking?

01:00:40.866 --> 01:00:42.731
What's this about?

01:00:42.732 --> 01:00:44.965
Samantha, we just want you
to get the help you deserve.

01:00:44.966 --> 01:00:46.332
I-I don't need any help.

01:00:46.333 --> 01:00:48.332
Samantha, we could
go away together,

01:00:48.333 --> 01:00:49.698
just you and me,

01:00:49.699 --> 01:00:52.365
have a little time
just for one another.

01:00:52.366 --> 01:00:54.731
You don't even know
what's wrong with me.

01:00:54.732 --> 01:00:55.965
Then take off your glasses.

01:00:55.966 --> 01:00:57.098
You think I'm on drugs.

01:00:57.099 --> 01:00:59.898
I know you're on drugs.
I know you are back on drugs!

01:00:59.899 --> 01:01:01.498
No, no, no!
I'm going to Nikki's.

01:01:01.499 --> 01:01:03.265
No, no!
Nikki is enabling you.

01:01:03.266 --> 01:01:04.298
That's right.
No!

01:01:04.299 --> 01:01:05.831
Nikki is absolutely wrong for you.

01:01:05.832 --> 01:01:08.132
We can get you through this...
together.

01:01:08.133 --> 01:01:09.631
We've done it before.
We can do it again.

01:01:09.632 --> 01:01:11.198
I don't even know who he is.

01:01:11.199 --> 01:01:13.098
Y-you do not know what's
going on with me.

01:01:13.099 --> 01:01:16.198
I'm really sorry that you don't approve of
your fucked-up daughter, but you know what?

01:01:16.199 --> 01:01:17.431
You're not so perfect yourself.

01:01:17.432 --> 01:01:20.399
You're looking for love from any men
that'll give you the time of day.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.664
Are you gonna stay
sober this time?

01:01:21.665 --> 01:01:23.332
Are you crazy?
You shut your mouth!

01:01:23.333 --> 01:01:24.731
No, you listen to me!

01:01:24.732 --> 01:01:27.298
Well, then talk, Samantha.
Tell us what's wrong.

01:01:27.299 --> 01:01:29.464
You want to know what's wrong?
Fine!

01:01:29.465 --> 01:01:31.033
Here!

01:01:37.266 --> 01:01:39.534
I'm sorry.

01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:01.433
Hi.
I'm here to sign in.

01:02:03.499 --> 01:02:07.135
Okay, and do you have your ID?

01:02:20.632 --> 01:02:23.998
Ah, yes, you have the
Dendrobium spectabile.

01:02:23.999 --> 01:02:25.664
We're very excited to see it.

01:02:25.665 --> 01:02:28.300
Well, this is it.

01:02:43.699 --> 01:02:46.468
Can I see you without the glasses?

01:03:04.766 --> 01:03:06.534
Just a second, please.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.098
I'm so sorry, but we're
not gonna be able

01:03:34.099 --> 01:03:36.365
to admit you into the competition.

01:03:36.366 --> 01:03:37.865
What? Why not?

01:03:37.866 --> 01:03:39.998
I-I've already gotten the letter.
I can go get it right now.

01:03:39.999 --> 01:03:43.068
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but there's nothing I can do.

01:04:00.499 --> 01:04:03.068
Nikki, open up, please.

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:06.300
Nikki!

01:04:11.665 --> 01:04:14.399
Nikki, I can hear your phone!

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.965
Please open up!
What's wrong?

01:04:16.966 --> 01:04:19.067
I just want to talk.

01:04:27.899 --> 01:04:29.065
Fuck off.

01:04:29.066 --> 01:04:30.731
Nikki, what's wrong?

01:04:30.732 --> 01:04:32.365
Alice told me all of it.

01:04:32.366 --> 01:04:34.198
She what?

01:04:34.199 --> 01:04:37.831
Yeah, about how you fucked
a man at her party.

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:39.400
About how you got loaded earlier.

01:04:42.099 --> 01:04:43.132
Nikki...

01:04:43.133 --> 01:04:46.798
Samantha, you fucked a man.

01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:47.898
Wake up.

01:04:47.899 --> 01:04:50.399
You're a confused little girl
going through a phase.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.664
Nikki, I care about you.
Please don't do this to me.

01:04:52.665 --> 01:04:55.232
Samantha, isn't it obvious?

01:04:55.233 --> 01:04:56.831
I'm not into you anymore.

01:04:56.832 --> 01:04:58.767
You've run your course.

01:05:02.066 --> 01:05:04.134
Is there someone else?

01:05:05.333 --> 01:05:07.198
Of course there's someone else.

01:05:07.199 --> 01:05:09.668
There's always someone else, love.

01:05:11.099 --> 01:05:12.500
Go away, Samantha.

01:05:41.233 --> 01:05:44.669
I... fucking love you!

01:06:26.999 --> 01:06:28.266
Alice!

01:06:34.766 --> 01:06:36.332
What the fuck are you doing?

01:06:36.333 --> 01:06:38.332
Why did you do it?
Why did you tell Nikki?

01:06:38.333 --> 01:06:41.198
Because you're out of control!
You can't fucking stand us together!

01:06:41.199 --> 01:06:42.831
You need some fucking
help, Samantha,

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:43.998
and you look like shit.

01:06:43.999 --> 01:06:45.564
Fuck you, Alice!
Admit it!

01:06:45.565 --> 01:06:47.466
I'm not saying shit to you.

01:06:50.066 --> 01:06:52.332
Is this what you want?

01:06:52.333 --> 01:06:54.434
You want me, right?

01:06:56.432 --> 01:06:58.898
Well, here I am.

01:06:58.899 --> 01:07:01.265
I'm all yours now.

01:07:01.266 --> 01:07:02.931
Get out of my house.
No.

01:07:02.932 --> 01:07:05.898
I mean it.
Get out of my house now!

01:07:05.899 --> 01:07:07.065
Now!

01:07:07.066 --> 01:07:09.201
You don't even know
what you made me do!

01:07:11.133 --> 01:07:13.301
What did you do?

01:07:18.266 --> 01:07:20.134
I'm all alone now.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.965
Sam, I love you.

01:07:34.966 --> 01:07:36.765
What I did is for your own good.

01:07:36.766 --> 01:07:38.834
You fucked everything up.

01:07:40.366 --> 01:07:42.167
Look at me.

01:07:56.766 --> 01:07:58.734
This is what you wanted.

01:08:12.465 --> 01:08:14.898
What the fuck?

01:08:14.899 --> 01:08:17.464
Help me!
Don't come near me!

01:08:17.465 --> 01:08:19.298
No, Alice.
Don't!

01:08:19.299 --> 01:08:20.663
Alice, please, Alice!

01:08:20.665 --> 01:08:22.064
I'm calling the police!

01:08:22.066 --> 01:08:24.801
No, no, don't!

01:08:25.999 --> 01:08:27.165
Get off of me, you freak!

01:08:27.166 --> 01:08:28.765
I can't let you do this, Alice!

01:08:28.765 --> 01:08:30.765
Help!

01:08:30.765 --> 01:08:32.834
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

01:08:42.032 --> 01:08:44.399
No.

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:47.435
No. I'm so sorry, Alice.

01:09:02.198 --> 01:09:04.167
But I can't let you do this!

01:09:48.698 --> 01:09:50.497
Hello?

01:09:50.499 --> 01:09:51.731
Hey, Riley.

01:09:51.732 --> 01:09:54.598
It's Samantha.

01:09:54.599 --> 01:09:57.132
Samantha, hey.

01:09:57.133 --> 01:09:58.467
Is everything okay?

01:10:00.665 --> 01:10:02.298
No.

01:10:02.299 --> 01:10:04.467
I need someone to talk to.

01:10:05.899 --> 01:10:08.431
Are you around?

01:10:08.432 --> 01:10:11.232
Y-yeah, yeah, of course.

01:10:11.233 --> 01:10:12.834
Where are you?

01:10:14.333 --> 01:10:16.268
I'm at Alice's.

01:11:45.299 --> 01:11:46.500
Hello?

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.101
Samantha?

01:12:01.099 --> 01:12:02.733
I'm here.

01:12:09.133 --> 01:12:10.601
Everything okay?

01:12:12.432 --> 01:12:14.333
Everything's fine.

01:12:20.366 --> 01:12:21.733
Where's Alice?

01:12:23.032 --> 01:12:24.867
She's in the back.

01:12:28.233 --> 01:12:30.201
So what's going on?

01:12:32.665 --> 01:12:35.834
I just...
I needed someone to talk to.

01:12:40.432 --> 01:12:42.332
Listen, I'm...

01:12:42.333 --> 01:12:44.664
I'm really sorry about earlier.

01:12:44.665 --> 01:12:46.266
It's not my place...

01:12:47.565 --> 01:12:49.433
You don't need to be sorry.

01:12:50.732 --> 01:12:53.498
You were just...

01:12:53.499 --> 01:12:55.065
looking out for me.

01:12:55.066 --> 01:12:57.835
Yeah.

01:12:59.732 --> 01:13:01.500
I really do like you.

01:13:04.066 --> 01:13:06.768
That's why I asked
you to come over.

01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:10.334
I need someone.

01:13:13.732 --> 01:13:15.698
Uh...

01:13:15.699 --> 01:13:17.800
W-what about Nikki?

01:13:19.766 --> 01:13:21.200
Or Alice?

01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:24.834
No cares the way you do.

01:13:28.699 --> 01:13:30.233
Um...

01:13:31.565 --> 01:13:32.731
I'm a little confused.

01:13:32.732 --> 01:13:35.232
I, uh...

01:13:35.233 --> 01:13:36.431
I'm confused.

01:13:36.432 --> 01:13:38.233
I-I thought you weren't into me.

01:13:41.966 --> 01:13:44.365
I'm going through...

01:13:44.366 --> 01:13:46.301
changes.

01:13:48.699 --> 01:13:50.867
I need someone that cares.

01:13:57.766 --> 01:13:59.865
I care.

01:13:59.866 --> 01:14:01.267
I know you do.

01:14:05.333 --> 01:14:08.664
You wouldn't... hurt me.

01:14:08.665 --> 01:14:10.198
Would you?

01:14:10.199 --> 01:14:11.965
No.

01:14:11.966 --> 01:14:13.965
No, I never would.

01:14:13.966 --> 01:14:15.300
Ever.

01:14:26.799 --> 01:14:28.265
Take this off.

01:14:28.266 --> 01:14:30.835
Okay.
Okay, okay.

01:14:39.299 --> 01:14:40.765
Shit!

01:14:40.766 --> 01:14:42.165
Shit, shit!

01:14:42.166 --> 01:14:43.198
What?

01:14:43.199 --> 01:14:44.898
Um...

01:14:44.899 --> 01:14:46.298
I don't have a condom.

01:14:46.299 --> 01:14:48.965
You're fine.
Really?

01:14:48.966 --> 01:14:50.531
Yeah.
Are you sure?

01:14:50.532 --> 01:14:52.100
Yeah.
Okay.

01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:04.831
Oh, God.

01:15:04.832 --> 01:15:06.132
Does that feel okay?

01:15:06.133 --> 01:15:08.332
Yeah, uh-huh.
That's okay.

01:15:08.333 --> 01:15:09.765
Okay.

01:15:09.766 --> 01:15:11.765
It kind of tingles.

01:15:11.766 --> 01:15:13.367
It's tingling.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.631
Is that okay?
It's okay.

01:15:17.632 --> 01:15:19.132
Okay.
Okay.

01:15:19.133 --> 01:15:20.701
Oh, wait. Wait.

01:15:21.999 --> 01:15:24.134
Oh, my God, you're really wet.

01:15:56.233 --> 01:15:57.564
Aah! Aah!

01:15:57.565 --> 01:16:00.631
What is that?
Wait. Wait. Wait.

01:16:00.632 --> 01:16:02.132
There's something moving.

01:16:02.133 --> 01:16:03.631
There's something moving in there.

01:16:03.632 --> 01:16:04.765
Oh, my-oh, my God.

01:16:04.766 --> 01:16:05.798
What the hell?

01:16:05.799 --> 01:16:08.568
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:16:13.099 --> 01:16:14.300
Riley!

01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:21.735
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:16:23.499 --> 01:16:25.332
Oh!

01:16:25.333 --> 01:16:26.399
Don't come near me!

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.336
I swear to God!

01:16:39.632 --> 01:16:42.534
Holy shit.

01:16:49.932 --> 01:16:52.365
Mom?

01:16:52.366 --> 01:16:53.798
Samantha, where are you?

01:16:53.799 --> 01:16:56.098
I'm down the street from Alice's.

01:16:56.099 --> 01:16:57.731
Are you in your car?

01:16:57.732 --> 01:16:59.631
I just want to come home.

01:16:59.632 --> 01:17:01.931
I'm gonna get you help, okay?

01:17:01.932 --> 01:17:04.332
But you need to let me help you.

01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:06.464
I want you to pull over.

01:17:06.465 --> 01:17:08.098
You don't need to be driving.

01:17:08.099 --> 01:17:10.598
You were right.

01:17:10.599 --> 01:17:11.998
We'll get through this!

01:17:11.999 --> 01:17:14.298
There's something wrong with me.

01:17:14.299 --> 01:17:15.800
Here!

01:17:17.932 --> 01:17:22.002
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

01:18:14.299 --> 01:18:15.965
Whoa, ma'am, you need to sit down!

01:18:15.966 --> 01:18:17.165
You've just been in accident!

01:18:17.166 --> 01:18:19.265
Whoa! Hey, get back!

01:18:19.266 --> 01:18:20.831
Ma'am, do you know
where you're at?

01:18:20.832 --> 01:18:22.198
Sam?

01:18:22.199 --> 01:18:23.533
Honey, it's me!
It's Mom!

01:18:24.932 --> 01:18:26.698
Ma'am, stay where you are!

01:18:26.699 --> 01:18:28.165
Ma'am, we need you
to stay where you are!

01:18:28.166 --> 01:18:30.434
Don't do it!
I said stay right there!

01:18:31.699 --> 01:18:33.498
Officer, don't shoot!

01:18:33.499 --> 01:18:35.267
Don't shoot!
She's my daughter!

01:18:36.465 --> 01:18:39.301
She's my daughter.
Sam! Honey, it's me!

01:18:40.432 --> 01:18:41.765
Come to me!

01:18:41.766 --> 01:18:43.399
Come to me!
You can relax!

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.631
I'm here to help you!

01:18:44.632 --> 01:18:45.833
It's gonna be okay!
