so we're gonna get started.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.910
Yes? Let's commence.

08:32.278 --> 08:33.646
Abby, where‐where's
Kaylee dancing?

08:33.646 --> 08:36.149
She's dancing
with the minis.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.417
The minis?
Yes.

08:37.417 --> 08:38.952
They need somebody older
in their group,

08:38.952 --> 08:40.720
'cause they're goofballs.
<i>In this mini team,</i>

08:40.720 --> 08:42.822
<i>there's some</i>
<i>nine‐ and ten‐year‐olds,</i>

08:42.822 --> 08:44.858
<i>but they're not advanced enough</i>

08:44.858 --> 08:46.626
<i>to carry the whole team,</i>
<i>so I'm hoping</i>

08:46.626 --> 08:48.194
the big one, who is 11,
will step up

08:48.194 --> 08:50.397
and become a leader
of that mini team.

08:50.397 --> 08:53.133
Do you care that you're
dancing with the minis?

08:53.133 --> 08:55.368
Or would you‐‐?
Kind of? Yeah.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.771
<i>You'd rather dance</i>
<i>with the older ones.</i>

08:57.771 --> 08:59.372
Oh, yeah.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.874
I know, honey.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.809
<i>Okay, you can be the leader</i>

09:02.809 --> 09:04.377
of the group, okay?

09:04.377 --> 09:05.412
All right.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.448
ASHLEE:
So, Jeannie?

09:08.448 --> 09:09.983
How do you feel about her

09:09.983 --> 09:11.718
dancing with six
and seven‐year‐olds?

09:11.718 --> 09:13.153
JEANNIE: I mean,
I think Kaylee should hang

09:13.153 --> 09:14.487
with the older team,
personally.

09:14.487 --> 09:17.557
I think that, technically,
she's at that level.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.292
Okay.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.460
I think this is funny.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.494
Jeannie really

09:21.494 --> 09:23.730
thought that Kaylee
was gonna dance

09:23.730 --> 09:25.765
with the juniors,
but she's not.

09:25.765 --> 09:27.567
<i>She's with our minis,</i>
<i>and at least</i>

09:27.567 --> 09:29.536
<i>we have a team this week.</i>

09:29.536 --> 09:32.205
So, girls, this is
a contemporary routine,

09:32.205 --> 09:35.041
entitled, "The...

09:35.041 --> 09:36.176
Vultures."

09:36.176 --> 09:37.477
It's a little different.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.579
The vulture
protects the nest.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.347
Yes?

09:41.347 --> 09:42.515
All right, let's go.

Nothing brings in students

Is Brynn back here somewhere?

10:22.188 --> 10:23.189
Okay.

Hey...

10:24.491 --> 10:26.459
Ooh, look at you!

10:26.459 --> 10:28.661
So, um, I was thinking
about taking you

10:28.661 --> 10:32.165
to The People's
Choice Awards with me.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.134
Really?
You want to go?

10:34.134 --> 10:36.035
Yeah!
Yeah?

10:36.035 --> 10:38.004
We have to get
you together, like,

10:38.004 --> 10:39.272
literally, in five minutes.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.573
<i>Brynn is kind of always</i>

10:40.573 --> 10:41.875
on the outs with the kids.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.576
You know, they don't
include her in things,

10:43.576 --> 10:45.979
because they can't stand
her mother Ashlee.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.647
<i>And since I'm considering</i>

10:47.647 --> 10:49.616
putting her on the team
permanently,

10:49.616 --> 10:52.118
<i>I want to see</i>
<i>how this kid behaves.</i>

10:52.118 --> 10:53.586
<i>Does she have</i>

10:53.586 --> 10:54.888
proper theater etiquette?

10:54.888 --> 10:56.389
Does she have the right manners?

10:56.389 --> 10:58.291
Can I see you?

10:58.291 --> 10:59.292
Me?

10:59.292 --> 11:00.894
Yeah.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.428
Oh‐‐

11:02.428 --> 11:04.330
Come here.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.632
Oh, look how cute you look!

11:05.632 --> 11:06.666
I like it!

11:06.666 --> 11:07.734
I'm gonna take her with me.

11:07.734 --> 11:08.768
You are?
Yes.

11:10.036 --> 11:13.706
JILL: Abby, why would you
not take your students?

11:13.706 --> 11:15.108
She wanted to go.
That's, like, ridiculous.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.910
JESSALYNN: This one
is Maddie's best friend.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.044
That's who you
really should take.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.413
All these kids have been to

11:20.413 --> 11:22.515
award show after award show.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.651
Brynn has never been
to an event like that.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.085
JILL:
Does Melissa know

11:26.085 --> 11:27.253
Brynn's going with you?

11:27.253 --> 11:29.088
Probably not.

11:29.088 --> 11:31.057
Melissa's gonna die
when she sees this.

11:31.057 --> 11:33.560
Melissa invited me,
and she gave me two tickets.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.928
She bought two tickets...

11:34.928 --> 11:35.995
She didn't say

11:35.995 --> 11:38.164
this ticket's for somebody else!

11:38.164 --> 11:39.465
You and Brynn
go have a good time.

11:39.465 --> 11:41.467
I just want you to know
Melissa will be disappointed.

11:41.467 --> 11:44.137
It's‐it's not worth
the aggravation.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.139
My God!

11:48.641 --> 11:50.243
I just think it's sad

11:50.243 --> 11:52.345
they can't just
for once be, like,

11:52.345 --> 11:53.446
oh, happy for Brynn ever.
No. No.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.547
It's not gonna happen.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.950
Brynn is not going.

11:56.950 --> 11:57.784
Period.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.219
Because I quit fighting.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.387
I quit fighting.
I don't fight anymore.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.589
Kalani,
you want to go?

12:08.261 --> 12:09.696
I don't want to go
to The People's Choice Awards

12:09.696 --> 12:12.098
with Abby because this drama
doesn't include me,

12:12.098 --> 12:13.933
and I don't want
to make it include me.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.403
Okay. Kendall,
do you really want to go?

12:19.072 --> 12:20.273
So, you don't want to go?

12:20.273 --> 12:21.341
Okay.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.742
You want to go, Jill?

<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

JILL: I don't understand
why Brynn is not going.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.630
Because you guys got so mad.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.931
You guys got so upset that

13:18.931 --> 13:22.435

<i>that I stole Brynn's ticket.</i>

13:29.942 --> 13:31.911
<i>I would never</i>

No one wants it!

13:33.346 --> 13:34.447
No one wants to go!

13:34.447 --> 13:36.916
It's‐it's like a bad deal.

13:36.916 --> 13:39.218
Brynn did want to go until
you guys ruined it for her.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.022
Nobody now.

13:43.022 --> 13:44.524

against these huge celebrities,

14:12.852 --> 14:14.087

And we're like‐‐
Why Brynn?

14:34.240 --> 14:35.475
That's what we said.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.943
ASHLEE:
Her reasoning was that

14:36.943 --> 14:38.711
Brynn had never been
to anything like that before.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.612
That's a dumb reason.

14:39.612 --> 14:40.613
Abby uninvited her

14:40.613 --> 14:42.348
when you guys threw such a fit!

14:42.348 --> 14:44.450
Did we uninvite her
or did Abby uninvite her?

14:44.450 --> 14:46.219
Abby uninvited her
because of you.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.620
So it's not our fault.
It's Abby.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.890
ASHLEE:
<i>It was them who made it</i>

14:50.890 --> 14:52.024
<i>so that Brynn couldn't go.</i>

14:52.024 --> 14:54.260
<i>It really is unbelievable</i>

14:54.260 --> 14:56.162
how they can distort
and twist things

14:56.162 --> 14:58.364

how they want to see it.

<i>Okay.</i>

15:00.900 --> 15:02.902

You better be

the mini trio was amazing.

HOLLY: <i>This entire week</i>

34:38.977 --> 34:41.079
<i>around the mini team drama,</i>

34:41.079 --> 34:43.214
<i>and that's unfortunate,</i>

34:43.214 --> 34:44.983
<i>the lead competition team</i>

34:44.983 --> 34:46.117

about vultures‐‐

they're resourceful,

looked good on stage, dancing.

I thought we need to
work on that pirouette,

and all that, but...

40:26.891 --> 40:28.393
the elite juniors, right now,

40:28.393 --> 40:30.561
they are getting older,

All right, keep working, okay?

All those tricks

40:47.145 --> 40:48.680
My disbehaving.

40:48.680 --> 40:49.714
She means misbehaving.

40:49.714 --> 40:51.416
We know what...
we know what she means.

40:51.416 --> 40:54.485
I don't want her crying in front

40:54.485 --> 40:55.486

so much for...

40:55.486 --> 40:57.288
Well, I think her...

40:57.288 --> 41:00.325
reaction, you know,
was to your action.

41:00.325 --> 41:02.560
She does not like
to see you in that light.

41:02.560 --> 41:03.962
Am I correct?

41:03.962 --> 41:05.263
ABBY LEE: Yes.
And I do respect you

41:05.263 --> 41:06.664

41:29.687 --> 41:32.690
You... asking those types
of questions...

41:32.690 --> 41:35.126
makes us not like
the kid as much.

41:35.126 --> 41:36.461
We‐we like your daughter.

41:36.461 --> 41:40.231
