00:37.467 --> 00:38.495
HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA 1974

00:38.595 --> 00:40.883
Stop desecrating God's holy world!

00:41.092 --> 00:42.258
'KILLER NUNS'
WORLD PREMIERE

00:42.425 --> 00:44.425
One two three four!
God's what we're fighting for!

00:44.592 --> 00:45.592
God's free speech!

00:45.758 --> 00:47.112
Five, six, seven, eight!
The Bible is--

00:47.212 --> 00:51.384
Boycott this movie. Make Hollywood stop
irreverent content!

00:52.217 --> 00:53.425
God is love!

00:56.550 --> 01:00.633
I've never seen the line down the block 
in front of one of our films before.

01:01.550 --> 01:03.508
It's a picket line, Uncle Max.

01:03.675 --> 01:06.925
Maybe the film is just ahead of its time.
You never know, Walter.

01:07.133 --> 01:10.020
When Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring
first performed

01:10.120 --> 01:12.267
at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées 
in Paris

01:12.367 --> 01:16.021
people were so overwhelmed
by its unique atonal qualities

01:16.135 --> 01:18.800
that a fist fight erupted 
amongst the patrons.

01:18.967 --> 01:22.217
What does that have to do with us?
- Well, I'm just saying.

01:26.342 --> 01:29.989
"The movie's excruciatingly bad taste 
can only be matched

01:30.089 --> 01:32.621
by the ineptitude of its execution.

01:32.758 --> 01:37.145
Truly, the only good thing 
about this film is that after 90 minutes...

01:37.567 --> 01:38.804
it's over."

01:39.383 --> 01:40.675
I thought you said we got a good review.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.092
This is a good review. They liked the end.

01:43.258 --> 01:46.682
Blasphemy! You're the devil! The devil!

01:47.274 --> 01:49.622
Stop the exploitation!

01:52.758 --> 01:55.717
Uncle Max, I gotta ask you something.

01:56.633 --> 01:59.383
We've been at this a long time...
-So?

01:59.550 --> 02:02.300
Do you think maybe we should...

02:03.842 --> 02:04.800
quit?

02:04.925 --> 02:07.550
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that word.

02:07.717 --> 02:12.008
Quit? Are you outta your fucking mind?
Quit, Walter?

02:12.217 --> 02:13.675
Bite your tongue.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.383
We don't quit. We're Miracle 
Motion Pictures. What's our motto?

02:18.550 --> 02:20.342
"If it's good - it's a miracle."

02:20.508 --> 02:25.217
Exactly. And why do we call ourselves MMP?
Because miracles are out there. They exist.

02:25.383 --> 02:29.175
They happen every day. 
Not to us but... they're real.

02:29.342 --> 02:32.092
All we have to do is to keep 
our eyes open and hearts free

02:32.258 --> 02:38.092
so that when our miracle presents itself,
we then recognize it and seize it accordingly.

02:38.258 --> 02:40.675
All right, let's go find our miracle.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.258
Great. Can you help me with the check?
-Sure.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.217
One two three four!

02:48.383 --> 02:49.675
God is what we're fighting for!

02:49.800 --> 02:52.633
Boycott movies made by MMP.

02:52.800 --> 02:56.592
They are not miracles
They are blasphemy!

03:01.342 --> 03:02.258
"Avon Used Car"

03:02.425 --> 03:03.883
Scene 1, take 1.

03:08.925 --> 03:12.300
Hi, I'm Duke Mon...

03:14.008 --> 03:16.883
Sorry. We will go again.
Keep it rollin'.

03:17.092 --> 03:19.175
It's fine. We're shooting on videotape.

03:19.342 --> 03:20.508
What?

03:20.675 --> 03:25.133
It's the latest thing. We're always rollin'.
So ready whenever you are, Duke.

03:37.133 --> 03:39.758
MY HEART SINGS
ONLY FOR YOU

03:52.782 --> 03:54.326
DUKE MONTANA
AND THE GOLDEN LASSO

03:58.932 --> 04:01.640
DUKE MONTANA
AND THE LOBOS OF THE RIVER

04:44.550 --> 04:46.758
Hey, Reggie, glad you're here.

04:47.467 --> 04:51.103
First I thought I would put 
a fucking bomb in your car.

04:51.412 --> 04:55.023
Like that Mexican kid did
in Orson Welles' "Touch Of Evil".

04:55.162 --> 04:57.008
That kid was shifty.

04:57.217 --> 04:58.967
Then I thought, "No..."

04:59.175 --> 05:01.775
What I'll do is I'll stab him to death

05:02.086 --> 05:05.342
like Tony Perkins did 
to Janet Leigh in "Psycho."

05:05.758 --> 05:07.842
That motherfucker really loved his mama.

05:08.008 --> 05:11.717
Then I thought,
"No, no. You know what I'll do?"

05:12.342 --> 05:13.934
I'll push his ass down the stairs

05:14.034 --> 05:16.804
like Richard Widmark did 
to that old bat in "Kiss of Death".

05:16.842 --> 05:20.925
Remember Tommy Udo?
- I haven't seen that one.

05:21.133 --> 05:23.342
Did you ever consider letting me go

05:23.508 --> 05:26.883
like Claude Rains did to John Garfield
in "They Made Me A Criminal"?

05:27.092 --> 05:28.550
Shit I hated that movie.

05:28.883 --> 05:31.800
That's bad luck for you, 
I liked that movie.

05:31.925 --> 05:33.863
Unfortunately for you, Max,

05:34.037 --> 05:37.847
this is one time 
when life would not imitate art.

05:40.633 --> 05:42.592
Reggie, listen.

05:42.758 --> 05:47.114
I told you this the movie business 
and there's always a chance

05:47.214 --> 05:48.795
that we could take a loss. 
I told you that.

05:49.175 --> 05:50.800
A "loss"?

05:51.217 --> 05:54.192
I just looked by the theater. 
You haven't sold one goddamn ticket.

05:54.364 --> 05:56.239
There's gotta be 
some sort of fucking record.

05:56.335 --> 05:57.409
But that's not my fault.

05:57.554 --> 06:00.381
I didn't do anything. Those goddamn Catholics 
went all the way crazy.

06:00.508 --> 06:04.508
They won't let people into the theaters.
But this is gonna blow over. Wait and see.

06:04.675 --> 06:07.842
And all of this press is great for us.
You can't buy this kind of publicity.

06:08.008 --> 06:09.758
Listen to me, Max.

06:10.550 --> 06:15.217
That piece of shit cost me 350,000 dollars.
I want my money back. all of it.

06:15.383 --> 06:17.550
But I don't have your money.
It's up on the screen.

06:17.717 --> 06:20.675
"A sure hit" - is what you said.
- I said that? - Yeah.

06:20.800 --> 06:23.217
I said that?
-"A guaranteed hit".

06:23.383 --> 06:25.550
We all heard you say that bull of shit.

06:25.717 --> 06:28.216
Reggie, come on, I'm a producer.

06:28.316 --> 06:31.308
You can't always believe every word I say 
when I'm trying to raise money.

06:31.342 --> 06:33.383
I get carried away.
That's normal.

06:33.550 --> 06:36.217
Just give me time. 
Give me time and I'll have your money.

06:36.383 --> 06:38.300
I'll have all of your money. I promise.

06:38.467 --> 06:39.383
You are lying.

06:39.550 --> 06:43.217
I swear I'm not lying.
Well, okay, I'm lying a little bit.

06:43.383 --> 06:46.648
But hear me out. I'm a hustler. 
I'm a producer. That's what I do.

06:46.842 --> 06:50.893
I promise I will look under every rock, 
every nook, every cranny.

06:50.993 --> 06:52.425
I will leave no stone unturned.

06:52.592 --> 06:56.682
I will leave no resource untapped 
until I have your money in full.

06:56.782 --> 06:57.659
I promise you.

06:57.758 --> 07:01.842
With vig?
- Yeah, vig... of course.

07:09.383 --> 07:11.883
All right, you got 72 hours.
-72 hours?

07:12.092 --> 07:13.872
After that I'll choke you to death.

07:13.925 --> 07:15.550
Like Tony Curtis in "The Boston Strangler"?

07:15.717 --> 07:17.425
You bet.

07:19.592 --> 07:21.383
I liked that movie.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.626
BEVERLY HILLS

07:47.883 --> 07:50.842
...but he's so drunk 
that he can't even stand up...

07:51.008 --> 07:52.633
...so they throw me out there...

07:52.800 --> 07:54.967
...thank God I'm a master of improvisation.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.324
And I thought to myself, 
"Who gives a shit?

07:57.628 --> 07:59.179
The French don't speak English."

08:00.883 --> 08:05.092
Security! Who the fuck let this guy in here?
-Funny.

08:05.258 --> 08:08.008
Max Barber.
-Jimmy Moore.

08:08.300 --> 08:11.925
I prefer "James".
-I remember you when you were just a kid.

08:12.133 --> 08:16.758
That was a long time ago, Max.
-Things have changed.

08:18.527 --> 08:19.350
Yeah.

08:20.342 --> 08:23.474
Can we go somewhere private to talk?
-Sure thing.

08:26.800 --> 08:31.092
Let me guess... you need money.

08:31.675 --> 08:33.092
Is it that obvious?

08:33.256 --> 08:36.174
No, I can't tell from your eyes.

08:36.342 --> 08:38.256
I can't tell from your posture.

08:38.424 --> 08:40.868
You've always concealed your motives well.

08:40.967 --> 08:43.548
That's one of the many things 
I've learned from working with you, Max.

08:43.674 --> 08:46.179
Never let them know 
what's really going on inside of you.

08:46.279 --> 08:47.274
Sit down.

08:49.592 --> 08:52.008
It's all over the street, Max.

08:52.467 --> 08:57.508
Your all of 350,000 of Reggie Fontaine
for your latest opus.

08:57.675 --> 09:00.425
Look, Jimmy... I mean James...

09:01.717 --> 09:03.592
It's all short term, believe me.

09:04.779 --> 09:08.675
What? You gotta whole strings in the hands 
you're putting together?

09:09.800 --> 09:12.800
All right. Very funny.
-I'm just messing with you, Max.

09:12.967 --> 09:16.508
I'm happy to give it to you.
For old time sake.

09:16.675 --> 09:17.758
Thank you.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.758
I'm just gonna need one thing in return.

09:21.883 --> 09:25.800
Terry Miller's script... 
"Paradise". I want it.

09:27.685 --> 09:28.437
No, Jimmy...

09:28.505 --> 09:31.258
It's the best script I've ever read.

09:31.425 --> 09:34.842
It's guaranteed best picture for me 
and I want it.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.967
I can't. Anything but that.

09:37.175 --> 09:38.706
You can't get it made, Max.

09:38.806 --> 09:41.449
It'll cost 10 million dollars 
to make that picture the right way.

09:41.549 --> 09:43.294
I can get that kind of money 
in a heartbeat.

09:43.394 --> 09:46.662
You couldn't put that kind of money 
together in a dozen lifetimes.

09:46.675 --> 09:48.258
Why are you being so goddamn stubborn?

09:48.425 --> 09:51.222
Because that script is my baby.
It what keeps me going, Jimmy.

09:51.322 --> 09:52.222
I can't do it.

09:53.133 --> 09:55.300
You forgot who brought it to you?
-Yeah. You did. So what?

09:55.367 --> 09:56.727
Look who put all the work into it.

09:56.827 --> 09:59.332
Look who had to fuck his widow 
to get their hand over the rights.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.962
You did? No, I did.
You know what courage that took?

10:02.058 --> 10:05.398
You had a chance to make it years ago 
when you were almost somebody.

10:05.498 --> 10:07.759
You wanted to make it 
with Frank Pierce, for Christ’s sake.

10:07.772 --> 10:09.628
Frank Pierce is a movie star!
-Frank Pierce is a bum.

10:09.728 --> 10:12.008
He's wrong for the part! He's dead wrong. 
He would've ruined it.

10:12.217 --> 10:15.592
At least it would've been 
something to ruin!

10:19.133 --> 10:24.383
350,000 dollars, Max.
I'll write you the check right now.

10:24.842 --> 10:28.342
I get that script once and for all 
and you avoid your shallow grave.

10:28.508 --> 10:31.175
I can't do it.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.175
500,000 dollars, Max.

10:36.258 --> 10:38.592
Absolutely not. I can't.

10:39.717 --> 10:41.467
750,000.

10:44.717 --> 10:45.967
I can't.

10:47.550 --> 10:51.633
All right... A million dollars, Max.

10:54.258 --> 10:56.175
A million?

10:57.092 --> 10:58.175
No...

10:58.550 --> 11:00.800
I can't...

11:00.967 --> 11:03.800
I'm not gonna let you have that script.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.175
Every scene is perfect.
Every word is a gem.

11:06.221 --> 11:08.024
You're beneath that script. 
You don't deserve it.

11:08.099 --> 11:10.155
I'm never gonna let you have it.

11:10.217 --> 11:13.133
You just gonna ruin it. 
You're gonna ruin it like Frank Pierce...

11:13.217 --> 11:13.858
Fine.

11:14.045 --> 11:15.497
You can't you just give me the money?

11:15.597 --> 11:17.507
You gotta put me through 
this fucking humiliation?

11:17.508 --> 11:19.967
I'll just make it 
with Walter once you're dead.

11:20.773 --> 11:22.716
I'll will that script to Ed Wood

11:22.816 --> 11:25.297
before I let you get your greasy 
fucking hands on it. Fuck you!

11:25.397 --> 11:27.694
Say hi to Reggie for me 
you self centered son of a bitch.

11:27.794 --> 11:32.633
You know what you make?
You make fucking garbage, and I win Oscars!

11:58.552 --> 12:00.056
7155 HOLLYWOOD BLVD

12:07.092 --> 12:08.300
Good morning.
-Good morning.

12:10.883 --> 12:11.842
What's this?

12:12.008 --> 12:14.967
It's a present from Jimmy Moore.
But it's an odd one.

12:15.175 --> 12:16.633
What does that card mean?
Did somebody die?

12:16.800 --> 12:17.717
No idea.

12:17.842 --> 12:19.461
He also sent this.

12:19.599 --> 12:20.658
VIPER LYE

12:21.633 --> 12:25.300
Why the hell would he send you 
a shovel and a bag of lye?

12:26.092 --> 12:29.092
It's an inside joke
between the two of us.

12:29.258 --> 12:34.133
You wanna let me hit on it?
-Not really. Any messages?

12:34.300 --> 12:36.592
Yeah, Reggie Fontaine.

12:36.758 --> 12:40.467
He only said "48 hours".
What the hell does that mean?

12:40.633 --> 12:42.467
I don't know.

12:42.758 --> 12:45.258
You don't know much this morning, do you?

12:46.842 --> 12:48.550
Walter...

12:49.383 --> 12:51.592
You're my nephew.

12:52.092 --> 12:57.258
If anything God forbid would happen to me
all of this would be yours.

12:57.800 --> 13:00.800
So I suppose you have the right to know
what's going on.

13:02.300 --> 13:06.449
We both know that Jimmy Moore
has wanted "Paradise" for forever.

13:06.640 --> 13:07.368
Yeah.

13:07.484 --> 13:12.008
Last night he made me an offer 
to buy the script.

13:12.217 --> 13:13.883
How much?
-It was a lot.

13:14.092 --> 13:16.092
How much is "a lot"?

13:16.258 --> 13:18.133
A million dollars.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.633
A million dollars? What'd you say?

13:21.800 --> 13:24.092
What do you think I said?
-I would image you said yes.

13:24.258 --> 13:27.853
I said no.
-What! Are you kid... It's a million dollars!

13:28.217 --> 13:30.999
Walter, what are we 
if we don't have our dreams?

13:31.054 --> 13:32.272
Rich?

13:35.800 --> 13:38.800
Walter... no, no...

13:39.467 --> 13:43.925
This script, "Paradise" 
is one of the greatest scripts ever written.

13:44.133 --> 13:48.342
We'd win Academy Awards.
Me and you up there on the stage taking bows.

13:48.508 --> 13:52.092
Up at the podium thanking each other.
Thanking each other.

13:52.258 --> 13:53.800
But a million dollars.

13:53.925 --> 13:57.675
With a million dollars we'd not only be out 
of the hock, we'd be living the good life.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.592
With a million dollars 
we could make a dozen more movies.

13:59.758 --> 14:01.914
I can't stand the thought 
of him making this film.

14:02.014 --> 14:03.340
After all the fucking work I did?

14:03.342 --> 14:06.058
Why should he be doing this.
Why should he be taking bows,

14:06.158 --> 14:08.933
receiving accolades
when I did all the fucking work?

14:09.033 --> 14:10.897
It was me! Me! Me!

14:10.967 --> 14:13.133
Don't you get that? Me!

14:13.508 --> 14:15.342
I'm not an idiot, 
I know you're in trouble.

14:15.377 --> 14:17.715
I'm in trouble? What do you mean? 
What are you talking about?

14:17.815 --> 14:19.673
The flowers and the shovel and the lye.

14:19.773 --> 14:22.456
And someone saying "48 hours". 
Come on. I'm not an idiot.

14:22.513 --> 14:23.704
What exactly are you getting at?

14:23.804 --> 14:26.599
I think you haven't painted 
the most accurate portrait of our investor,

14:26.699 --> 14:27.605
Mr. Fontaine.

14:29.474 --> 14:32.952
Walter, sometimes you stun me 
with your ability to connect the dots.

14:33.052 --> 14:33.968
That's amazing.

14:34.113 --> 14:35.342
Don't patronize me.
-I'm not patro--

14:35.508 --> 14:37.425
Yes, you're being very patronizing.
-I'm not patronizing you.

14:37.592 --> 14:39.649
You're talking down to me 
like I'm a nephew.

14:39.749 --> 14:41.395
I'm not patronizing you.
- Yes, you are!

14:41.495 --> 14:44.508
All right! Yes, we're in trouble.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.958
We've been in trouble before.
We're always in trouble.

14:47.058 --> 14:48.894
We always find a way out, Walter.

14:48.925 --> 14:51.925
That's what we do. We're Miracle 
Motion Pictures. What's our motto?

14:52.133 --> 14:53.584
Stop with the motto!

14:54.004 --> 14:56.665
You were talking about miracles yesterday.
How they're out there.

14:56.765 --> 14:59.883
All we have to do is recognize them 
when they presented themselves.

15:00.092 --> 15:01.834
I'll tell you what a miracle is.

15:01.994 --> 15:04.580
It's a miracle that Jimmy Moore 
wants to cut you a check

15:04.743 --> 15:08.080
for a million dollars 
over some stupid script.

15:08.248 --> 15:10.249
How could you say stupid script? 
Don't you...

15:10.429 --> 15:13.274
How can you say stupid script?
You take that back right now, Walter.

15:13.374 --> 15:14.790
You worked on this too, Walter!

15:14.800 --> 15:17.315
For once in your life please be practical.

15:17.415 --> 15:19.337
Sell the script. Take the money.

15:20.479 --> 15:22.742
Look at this place. 
Let's turn our lives around.

15:22.758 --> 15:25.316
Turn your life around 
while you still got it.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.761
Okay? Please.

15:26.901 --> 15:28.466
It's the adult thing to do.

15:36.967 --> 15:39.323
So then we agree? 1.2 million?

15:46.076 --> 15:47.112
Yeah.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.717
I'm proud of you, Max.
It's the adult thing to do.

15:51.842 --> 15:54.508
That's exactly what I said, Jimmy.

15:54.842 --> 15:55.938
James...

15:57.837 --> 16:02.175
I'll have the paperwork drawn up 
and over to you by 6:00 PM.

16:02.425 --> 16:05.234
And in the spirit of being adult

16:05.438 --> 16:12.635
here is down payment of 350,000 dollars.

16:13.717 --> 16:19.342
So that you can take care of your... 
investor issues.

16:21.092 --> 16:23.133
Take it, Max...

16:23.300 --> 16:27.425
Take it, Max. Again, 
it's the adult thing to do.

16:45.425 --> 16:48.133
He's kidding, right?
-No, he's not kidding.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.800
You're not kidding, Max?

16:52.133 --> 16:54.383
Hey, stop it...

16:54.633 --> 16:57.758
We're gonna find you another great script.

16:59.592 --> 17:03.008
Why don't you guys come by
the set? It's the first day of shooting.

17:03.217 --> 17:07.175
Frank Pierce is gonna be there.
He's gonna perform a terrific stunt.

17:07.340 --> 17:08.800
Frank Pierce is my favorite actor.

17:08.965 --> 17:14.383
I'm gonna cast him as the lead in "Paradise".
-That's exciting!

17:14.550 --> 17:16.715
We love Frank Pierce.

17:16.840 --> 17:20.133
Let's go visit the set, huh?
And see him do his stunt.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.883
I would love to meet Frank Pierce.

17:23.090 --> 17:25.965
You're not kidding?
-Let's go meet Frank Pierce.

17:26.175 --> 17:29.258
Frank, give me a second, 
I'll get you strapped up, bud.

17:29.425 --> 17:30.967
Here you go, darlin'.

17:31.717 --> 17:36.342
Did I tell you guys 
about the new Oldsmobile 442?

17:36.508 --> 17:38.800
It's got a rocket 4.55 in it.

17:38.925 --> 17:43.467
Cops were chasing me all over the Laurel
last night, couldn't catch me.

17:45.967 --> 17:48.342
Wow, a real movie set.

17:48.508 --> 17:51.550
Come on, act like you've been on set before.
-That's Frank Pierce right there!

17:51.717 --> 17:54.383
I see it.
- It certainly is. You wanna go say hi?

17:54.456 --> 17:56.333
Do you think I could? 
I don't wanna bother him.

17:56.467 --> 17:58.987
It's not bothering. I called ahead 
and told him you were coming.

17:59.087 --> 18:01.643
And he said as soon as you get here 
to just walk right over there.

18:01.743 --> 18:03.235
Okay. I'll be right back.

18:03.925 --> 18:05.717
You know Frank's wrong for "Paradise".

18:05.842 --> 18:09.592
He's a movie star, Max. 
One of the biggest in the world.

18:09.758 --> 18:11.925
With him the picture gets 
an automatic green light.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.622
He doesn't have the gravitas 
to play the lead character.

18:14.722 --> 18:16.418
This is a story about dreams.

18:16.716 --> 18:20.467
The stuff that lingers in their souls. 
It's about a man who refuses to perform.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.925
Who goes on a quest.

18:22.133 --> 18:24.508
Excuse me, Mr. Pierce? I'm so sorry 
to bother you, I'm Walter Creason.

18:24.675 --> 18:25.883
James said that I could say hi.

18:26.092 --> 18:29.592
Guys, can we lock it up? 
Where's the security?

18:29.758 --> 18:30.550
What's going on around here?

18:30.717 --> 18:34.092
I'm James Moore's 
associate friend acquaintance.

18:34.258 --> 18:37.633
That's right! Jimmy's friend.
Yeah. Yeah. Nice to meet you.

18:37.800 --> 18:40.546
Yeah, Max, I know the goddamn story.

18:40.646 --> 18:43.008
But Jimmy, James, this is my letter 
to the world.

18:43.217 --> 18:46.899
How many more movies can I make?
You remember when I was starting this project?

18:46.999 --> 18:52.217
Please just consider, we can't have 
someone like... Frank is totally wrong.

18:52.383 --> 18:54.641
You need someone who's not happy
with the way things are.

18:54.741 --> 18:57.919
You need someone who's looking for 
a better world, looking for a better life.

18:57.925 --> 19:00.550
Who's tortured in living 
in an alternate universe

19:00.717 --> 19:05.133
but ultimately is forced to confront 
the demons of his own reality.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.359
You sound like you'd be perfect
for the part.

19:07.459 --> 19:09.133
Yeah. What?

19:09.300 --> 19:12.717
Nice to meet you. Can I shake your hand? 
I am your biggest fan.

19:12.842 --> 19:15.717
Please?
Frank, you're not strapped in yet.

19:15.842 --> 19:18.076
Would you calm down, please?

19:19.027 --> 19:22.205
Not like I haven't done this 
a million times before, you know what I mean?

19:22.206 --> 19:24.217
He's Frank Pierce,
I think he knows what he's doing.

19:24.383 --> 19:27.675
Please don't use him.
Don't use him. I'll do anything.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.758
What happened to you, Max? Honestly.
-What can I do?

19:30.883 --> 19:33.217
The Max I used to know would kill
to get this movie made.

19:33.383 --> 19:37.258
Respect my age, James. You worked for me.
-Don't let me down anymore.

19:37.425 --> 19:40.758
You're embarrassing me, Max. This is sad.

19:40.883 --> 19:42.675
Can I get your autograph?

19:44.008 --> 19:46.717
Please?
-Sure.

19:46.842 --> 19:49.633
Just let it go, Max. Let it go.

19:52.092 --> 19:55.383
This is my letter
to the world. Please?

19:55.550 --> 19:58.300
No, I'm giving it to Frank Pierce.

19:58.633 --> 20:00.550
Fuck you... prick.

20:00.717 --> 20:01.842
Here's a pen.

20:02.133 --> 20:03.758
Give me a fucking break.

20:10.883 --> 20:11.800
Frank!

20:17.467 --> 20:18.425
Frank!

20:23.800 --> 20:26.133
Looks like that's lunch.

20:29.925 --> 20:32.685
Such a wonderful day, yes a wonderful day.

20:32.785 --> 20:35.670
I just saw a movie star fall away.

20:37.175 --> 20:40.550
Walter, did you see the look on his face?

20:40.717 --> 20:41.800
Whose, Frank's?

20:41.925 --> 20:44.236
How could I look at Frank's face? 
He was 20 storeys down.

20:44.519 --> 20:45.557
I'm talking about Jimmy.

20:45.592 --> 20:48.550
Watching his dreams implode 
just like Frank's head when he hit that bus.

20:48.717 --> 20:53.800
That look was fucking priceless! Priceless

20:53.925 --> 20:56.111
I loved it. I loved it.

20:56.987 --> 20:58.786
And I have you to thank for that, Walter.
-What?

20:58.886 --> 21:01.300
Because if you hadn't twisted my arm 
to go and struck this deal

21:01.400 --> 21:03.044
this whole thing never would've happened.

21:03.225 --> 21:06.636
You're right, Walter, "Oh, God". 
It's times like these when I actually believe

21:06.736 --> 21:08.907
in the big guy upstairs.

21:08.951 --> 21:11.383
What you're saying 
is so incredibly horrible.

21:11.550 --> 21:14.758
<i>Schadenfreude</i>, that's what it's called.
That's what the Germans call it.

21:14.883 --> 21:17.214
"Please derived 
from the misfortune of others".

21:17.261 --> 21:19.781
Leave it to the Krauts... They come up 
with an actual word for it.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.100
I don't want this party to end.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.193
I wanna go back to my place 
and I wanna get drunk.

21:23.293 --> 21:24.319
I think I'm gonna throw up.

21:24.419 --> 21:25.566
You can do whatever you want.

21:25.666 --> 21:29.097
I'm going back there 
and I am going to get drunk. Celebrate it.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.467
It's on. Come on. It's on.

21:32.967 --> 21:35.133
Walter, come on!
-I don't wanna see it.

21:35.300 --> 21:37.550
Come on, you have to, it's part 
of the healing process. Come on.

21:37.717 --> 21:38.967
<i>In sad news today...</i> 
- Come on!

21:39.175 --> 21:41.470
<i>Hollywood is mourning the loss 
of one of their own,</i>

21:41.505 --> 21:44.481
<i>Frank Pierce, 
renowned for doing all of his own stunts</i>

21:44.581 --> 21:48.258
<i>died today in a fall 
from the Los Angeles courthouse.</i>

21:48.425 --> 21:52.425
<i>We're just in shock.</i>

21:52.762 --> 21:53.889
Can you believe this asshole?

21:53.989 --> 21:56.899
Going on TV like this
sucking up all the glory for himself?

21:56.925 --> 21:59.800
You're a dick. 
You're a dick, you little shithead!

22:00.300 --> 22:03.842
<i>At this time I would also liked to say</i>

22:04.008 --> 22:08.800
<i>that the whole production, 
we gonna cancel it</i>

22:08.967 --> 22:11.133
Look at this guy. He's so fucking phony!

22:15.217 --> 22:19.008
<i>I love you, Frank...
Fucking Frank Pierce, man.</i>

22:19.217 --> 22:24.008
Did you hear that? Guess whose movie 
fell apart this time, jerk-off?

22:24.217 --> 22:26.800
Yours did. It fell. Get it?

22:26.967 --> 22:28.836
<i>It is worth noting however</i>

22:28.882 --> 22:31.222
<i>that because Pierce 
did all of his own stunts</i>

22:31.312 --> 22:33.354
<i>he was insured for five million dollars.</i>

22:33.454 --> 22:35.951
<i>A portion of which 
James Moore is planning to donate</i>

22:36.051 --> 22:37.552
<i>to a foundation set in Pierce's name. </i>

22:37.652 --> 22:39.858
Five million dollars, oh my God. 
Five million dollars.

22:39.917 --> 22:42.187
This scumbag walks away 
with five million dollars.

22:42.342 --> 22:46.925
He doesn't shoot a frame of the fucking film 
and he makes five million dollars?

22:47.133 --> 22:49.842
I'm beaten up. I'm done. He's the devil.

22:50.008 --> 22:52.891
I don't have enough holy water, 
crucifixes, garlic

22:52.991 --> 22:54.779
to be able to fight 
this fucking son of a...

22:54.883 --> 22:57.800
You're a fucking crook. 
You little fucking shit!

22:57.967 --> 23:00.592
His a fucking crook! This is crazy.
-Calm down...

23:00.758 --> 23:03.686
You're fucking killing me. You see 
where I live, in this fucking shithole.

23:03.786 --> 23:07.203
And your little fucking face, 
you fucking... You little shithead!

23:07.245 --> 23:08.644
You're gonna give yourself a stroke.

23:08.744 --> 23:12.217
Please, God, give me 
a fucking stroke. Let me die!

23:12.383 --> 23:16.592
Let me go right now! Let me die.
This is so fucking unjust.

23:16.758 --> 23:20.383
Somebody's at the door. Can you please calm--
-What more do I need?

23:20.550 --> 23:22.383
A delivery for Mr. Barber 
from James Moore.

23:22.550 --> 23:25.842
Give us a second 
and we'll get back to you, okay?

23:26.717 --> 23:28.175
The final nail to the coffin.

23:28.342 --> 23:30.808
Give me a pen, Walter 
so I could stab myself to death

23:30.908 --> 23:32.564
and put myself out of my fucking misery.

23:32.633 --> 23:35.258
You're thinking about this 
the wrong way, Uncle Max.

23:35.425 --> 23:37.758
You're not putting yourself 
in James' shoes.

23:37.883 --> 23:42.800
Remember in "Killer Nuns" 
when Bernadette Tabbot caught on fire?

23:42.967 --> 23:45.342
How would you have felt 
if she burnt to death

23:45.508 --> 23:49.758
and all you had to show for it 
was a lousy insurance check?

24:03.633 --> 24:08.133
You know, Walter, as always you're right.
-Thank you.

24:14.842 --> 24:16.842
FUCK YOU!

24:17.008 --> 24:19.175
SINCERELY, MAX BARBER

24:19.592 --> 24:24.383
All right, let's give this back to James.

24:25.267 --> 24:26.906
You did it! You went through with it.

24:27.006 --> 24:29.604
I gotta be honest I didn't think 
you were gonna get through with it.

24:29.687 --> 24:31.567
Of course I'm gonna go through with it.

24:32.883 --> 24:33.842
Here you go.

24:34.008 --> 24:36.233
Wait, let's give the young man a nice tip

24:36.333 --> 24:38.769
here for going out of his way.
-Sure.

24:41.800 --> 24:45.175
Here you go, that's for you.
Thank you for waiting.

24:45.342 --> 24:48.300
You did it. You signed it. You went 
through with it. I'm so proud of you.

24:48.467 --> 24:49.383
How does it feel?

24:49.550 --> 24:53.008
Surprisingly wonderful. Invigorating.

24:53.217 --> 24:55.722
I feel very inspired all of the sudden.

24:55.822 --> 24:58.439
A whole new sense of purpose 
is washing over me, Walter.

24:58.550 --> 25:00.300
We're making our next movie

25:00.443 --> 25:02.926
and I wanna be in production 
as soon as we can.

25:03.175 --> 25:05.175
It'll be our greatest venture 
to the world of cinema.

25:05.342 --> 25:08.592
I love it when you get inspired.
What script you wanna make?

25:08.758 --> 25:10.883
What script do you wanna make?

25:11.092 --> 25:12.800
The blue one.

25:14.008 --> 25:15.717
The blue one?
-Yeah.

25:16.817 --> 25:19.383
This is "The Oldest Gun In The West"?
This is Uncle Eddie's script.

25:19.550 --> 25:22.550
Yeah, may he rest in peace. 
"The Oldest Gun In The West". It's perfect.

25:22.717 --> 25:25.675
You hate this script.
-Hated... past tense.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.592
So you like it now?
-Like it? I love it.

25:28.758 --> 25:31.592
I can't think of anything 
more worthy to being put on celluloid.

25:31.758 --> 25:33.508
That's what I've been saying forever!
-I know.

25:33.675 --> 25:35.964
I love this script. How could you not 
love the story

25:36.064 --> 25:39.493
about the washed up cowboy 
finding out that he is Indian blood.

25:39.592 --> 25:43.497
And then helping his tribe drive out 
all the bigoted members of the town

25:43.597 --> 25:45.855
that have settled on their land 
after screwing them over

25:45.955 --> 25:48.714
in a horrible land deal?
-It's a magnificent story.

25:48.798 --> 25:51.543
Oh my God, all this time I thought 
you weren't even listening to me.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.706
Of course I've been listening.

25:52.806 --> 25:55.850
Just sometimes it takes a little time 
for the words to sink into this...

25:56.556 --> 25:57.874
skull of mine.

25:58.758 --> 26:04.508
So what do you say, Walter? How about it?
-Are you kidding me? I am so in, partner.

26:05.383 --> 26:06.633
Let's go find our star.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.758
Okay. Back at it.

26:14.092 --> 26:16.772
I don't know about this, Uncle Max. 
These people look really...

26:16.886 --> 26:18.252
Talented?
-Old.

26:18.352 --> 26:19.267
That's the point.

26:19.592 --> 26:21.659
There's a lot of dangerous stunts 
in this film.

26:21.759 --> 26:22.605
I know.

26:22.967 --> 26:27.800
Walter, my dear nephew, 
who doesn't love a comeback?

26:27.967 --> 26:31.357
Think of what we gonna do. 
We gonna give one of this forgotten souls

26:31.357 --> 26:32.696
one last shot at glory

26:32.777 --> 26:38.142
while giving their adoring public our ticket 
to buy the chance to re-live their childhoods.

26:38.242 --> 26:39.954
I mean that's beautiful, isn't it?

26:41.467 --> 26:43.467
It kinda is when you put it that way.

26:44.133 --> 26:45.675
Come on.

26:51.967 --> 26:53.383
Good morning.

26:53.550 --> 26:54.842
Good morning, gentlemen.
-Good morning.

26:55.008 --> 26:57.092
Are you here to join the facility?

26:57.258 --> 26:59.915
Not in the matters you're thinking. 
We're producers. Film producers.

27:00.015 --> 27:01.044
My name is Max Barber.

27:01.144 --> 27:04.133
This is my partner, Walter Creason.
And we're from Miracle Motion Pictures.

27:04.300 --> 27:08.550
We're looking to cast 
a male lead in our new film.

27:08.717 --> 27:11.467
Did you say producers?
-Yes, I did.

27:11.758 --> 27:16.592
I've lived in New York for 35 years.
I did 16 Broadway musicals.

27:16.758 --> 27:20.717
I'm a singer. I'm a dancer. 
I did two shows with Bob Fosse.

27:22.065 --> 27:25.092
What you need is someone 
with real acting chops

27:25.258 --> 27:26.935
not some old hoofer.

27:26.976 --> 27:31.575
I starred alongside Laurence Olivier, 
Ingrid Bergman,

27:31.925 --> 27:33.467
and Orson Welles!

27:33.675 --> 27:35.133
That's impressive.
-That's impressive.

27:35.300 --> 27:38.925
You wanna see impressive? Watch this!

27:47.717 --> 27:49.758
My heart! Help!

27:50.925 --> 27:52.300
Doctor!

27:55.758 --> 27:58.800
I'm telling you if he's not actually dead 
that was pretty damn convincing.

27:58.925 --> 28:04.092
Who gives a shit if he's alive or dead? 
What you need is a strong female character.

28:04.258 --> 28:07.300
I think we'll probably go just a little bit 
younger with the female role.

28:07.467 --> 28:09.550
I was a child actor.
-Were you?

28:09.717 --> 28:12.675
Maybe you saw me in "The Dead Incas".
I was the kid in the end.

28:12.800 --> 28:14.550
You gotta get me outta here.

28:14.717 --> 28:19.258
Come on back to my room and I'll show you 
just how right I am for the role.

28:19.675 --> 28:22.717
Uncle Max, one of them got me.
-I'm trying.

28:22.842 --> 28:24.383
I'll pay you.
-Sure.

28:24.550 --> 28:27.092
Put me in the trunk of your car.
Just take me with you.

28:27.258 --> 28:29.728
Just take your fucking hands off me.
-Take me with you!

28:29.800 --> 28:32.425
Go. We'll talk to you later.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.758
Quick, Walter. In here.

28:45.425 --> 28:47.383
Sorry to interrupt.

28:49.758 --> 28:53.074
Oh my God, you're Duke Montana,
"The Man with the Golden Lasso".

28:54.258 --> 28:56.717
You think you fellas could give me 
a little privacy here?

28:56.842 --> 28:58.671
You're Duke Montana?
-Yeah, that's Duke Montana.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.125
What are you doing, Duke Montana?

29:00.225 --> 29:02.175
My daily game of Russian Roulette.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.611
You could kill yourself 
doing something like that.

29:05.711 --> 29:07.884
It's more like euthanasia.
-But it's wrong.

29:08.023 --> 29:09.967
Well I'll have to kill someone, son.

29:10.175 --> 29:12.504
You reckon that it would rather be you?
-Wait! Don't!

29:12.604 --> 29:15.342
Mr. Montana? 
You can't kill us. We're producers.

29:15.508 --> 29:17.550
I've always wanted to kill a producer.

29:17.717 --> 29:20.425
Even the ones that came here 
to give you your next part?

29:20.592 --> 29:21.800
My next part?

29:21.925 --> 29:24.425
That's right, Duke. 
Now if you'd put that gun down...

29:24.592 --> 29:28.758
my partner here and I would like to offer 
you the leading role in our next film.

29:30.092 --> 29:32.800
Can we just have a quick chat?

29:33.217 --> 29:35.008
Excuse us a moment.
- One moment.

29:36.175 --> 29:39.258
Him? You're offering him the part?
-Yeah I'm offering him the part. He's perfect.

29:39.425 --> 29:40.550
He's suicidal.

29:40.717 --> 29:44.758
He's a star, Walter. He's worked 
with John Ford, John Houston. He's perfect.

29:44.883 --> 29:45.967
That was 20 years ago.

29:46.175 --> 29:48.678
So what? Think about all the pain 
and hardship, and anguish

29:48.778 --> 29:50.702
that must've brought him 
to this very moment

29:50.802 --> 29:52.445
in his life when he tries to kill himself.

29:52.545 --> 29:54.842
Imagine bringing that pain 
to this character.

29:55.008 --> 29:57.550
That's charisma. That's depth. 
That's gravitas.

29:57.717 --> 29:58.733
That's insane.
-Not true.

29:58.833 --> 30:01.008
Let me say it to you, boys.
-You don't know what you're talking about.

30:01.217 --> 30:02.633
I'm not interested.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.217
I'm totally washed up.

30:05.383 --> 30:10.500
I have no desire whatsoever to make 
any kind of a goddamn comeback.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.111
I just wanna die.

30:13.758 --> 30:15.467
<i> Comprende, amigo? </i>

30:16.925 --> 30:19.217
<i> Comprende, amigos? </i>

30:19.883 --> 30:24.732
Duke, I gotta tell you 
as an experienced producer,

30:24.917 --> 30:27.790
you are perfect for this particular part.

30:27.967 --> 30:30.119
I can't think of anybody better than you.

30:30.219 --> 30:32.176
Let's leave him alone.
I think he might be afraid.

30:32.276 --> 30:34.550
Afraid? Duke Montana 
is not afraid of a goddamn thing!

30:34.717 --> 30:37.883
I didn't mean "afraid" like that.
-Do you think I can't do this role?

30:38.092 --> 30:41.133
You're the one who said you were finished.
- I'll be the judge of that.

30:41.184 --> 30:43.002
That's right, you let him be 
the judge of that.

30:43.102 --> 30:44.803
He was the judge of that.
-He is the judge--

30:44.903 --> 30:47.234
And I'm the judge...
-You both the judge of that. Case closed.

30:47.309 --> 30:48.558
Goddamnit!

30:53.740 --> 30:54.997
Shit.

31:15.258 --> 31:17.383
I'm in, fellas.

31:18.092 --> 31:21.092
I am in.

31:23.300 --> 31:24.550
Duke...

31:26.342 --> 31:27.925
Congratulations.

31:39.258 --> 31:42.175
Hey, is Bess home?

31:42.592 --> 31:44.883
No, Mr. Montana, she's not here.

31:46.300 --> 31:50.217
Will she be back later?
-No, sir. She's out of town.

31:52.842 --> 31:56.800
Do you know if she's been reading 
my letters or throwing them out?

31:58.133 --> 32:00.967
Hell, never mind, 
that's not a fair question.

32:01.175 --> 32:05.717
Just tell her that I was here.
Tell her I came by.

32:06.550 --> 32:07.508
Sure.

32:39.217 --> 32:42.342
Hey, you gotta pay the rent.

32:42.800 --> 32:46.633
I hope that's my money 
you've got in that bag, Max.

32:48.967 --> 32:53.675
I got Moo goo gai pan, I got ribs. 
Egg rolls maybe? Anything else?

32:53.800 --> 32:56.217
All I want is my money.

32:56.383 --> 32:59.550
Just give me my money and me 
and the boys will be on our way.

32:59.717 --> 33:02.217
What, on an empty stomach?
Come on, Reggie...

33:02.271 --> 33:04.798
Why don't guys grab some plates over 
in the cupboard over there.

33:04.898 --> 33:07.428
And then we gonna get some silverware 
over this drawer over here.

33:07.528 --> 33:10.868
And then I could tell you 
how you can make some real money.

33:11.210 --> 33:13.546
How about five times more than your money?

33:13.550 --> 33:17.467
Don't tell me that want me
to invest in another goddamn movie, Max.

33:17.633 --> 33:20.175
That's exact same <i>spiel</i> you used before.

33:20.342 --> 33:24.125
But the difference is that this time 
I can absolutely guarantee

33:24.225 --> 33:25.790
that you gonna make a ton of money.

33:25.800 --> 33:30.175
You guaranteed it the last time.
Same shit, different day, Max.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.800
Then I'm guaranteeing it again with 
a completely new guarantee. How about that?

33:33.925 --> 33:37.092
All right, that's enough.
Choke the fucking life out of him.

33:38.342 --> 33:39.717
Please...

33:41.425 --> 33:44.800
Reggie, don't you at least wanna hear 
what I have to say?

33:44.925 --> 33:48.508
About some goddamn movie? No, all I want 
to hear is you struggling to breathe.

33:48.675 --> 33:51.842
But Reggie, I'm telling you 
this can't fail, just listen.

33:52.008 --> 33:56.175
You can crush my windpipe 
in a minute, just listen.

33:56.342 --> 33:57.965
All right, Max. One minute.

33:58.065 --> 34:00.125
You've got one minute.
-Okay.

34:01.967 --> 34:07.425
Yeah, well, look, I gotta script.
I've got Duke Montana.

34:07.592 --> 34:10.967
Duke Montana?
-Yeah, Duke Montana.

34:13.132 --> 34:14.007
He's alive?

34:14.217 --> 34:16.632
Yeah, barely, but he's alive.

34:17.300 --> 34:20.132
All I need to get this payday going.

34:20.300 --> 34:26.342
All I need to do to get this 
absolute guaranteed payday off the ground -

34:26.507 --> 34:28.675
just some money, 
that's all. Just a little money.

34:29.425 --> 34:31.132
How much money, Max?

34:31.842 --> 34:32.967
A million dollars?

34:33.425 --> 34:34.342
Kill him.

34:34.675 --> 34:37.800
No, no, that's not a minute. 
You said you'd give me a minute.

34:37.925 --> 34:41.257
That's not...

34:41.757 --> 34:44.967
That's not a minute. 
You said you'd give me a minute.

34:45.175 --> 34:47.842
We're not really gonna be making a movie.

34:48.007 --> 34:51.842
We're gonna make it look 
like we're making a movie. It's a scam.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.757
Wait!

34:58.717 --> 35:00.258
Let him go.

35:02.758 --> 35:04.133
Come over here, Maxy.

35:13.175 --> 35:14.592
Have a seat.

35:16.675 --> 35:20.550
Now you speak in my language.
What do you mean "a scam"?

35:20.717 --> 35:21.655
A scam.

35:22.263 --> 35:25.259
But we'll make it look like we're actually 
gonna be putting together a movie.

35:25.359 --> 35:27.633
That we're serious about it. 
The bigger the better.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.658
We're making an entire movie.

35:29.807 --> 35:32.276
We heavily insure the star 
who'll do his own stunts,

35:32.300 --> 35:34.105
which Duke Montana will do.

35:34.141 --> 35:38.236
And then on the first day of shooting. 
Bam! We kill him in a stunt. He's dead.

35:38.508 --> 35:41.036
And the insurance companies 
they pay us all off.

35:41.487 --> 35:45.193
And then what? We're rich. We're rich!

36:03.592 --> 36:05.800
You say you've got egg rolls?

36:07.717 --> 36:09.717
Find me egg rolls.

36:15.932 --> 36:17.618
DUKE MONTANA IS BACK!

36:27.758 --> 36:30.800
How is it the guy making a million dollar 
movie doesn't have a better car?

36:30.925 --> 36:33.592
Well, Duke, I don't believe in
instantaneous flamboyance.

36:33.758 --> 36:36.967
I believe it corrupts and corrodes 
the creative process.

36:37.175 --> 36:37.993
"Creative process?"

36:38.093 --> 36:41.432
Your last movie was about a bunch 
of fucking nuns slicing people to ribbons.

36:41.508 --> 36:42.730
That ain't exactly Shakespeare.

36:42.830 --> 36:44.598
Trying to hurt my feelings,
aren't you, Duke?

36:44.698 --> 36:47.334
You have feelings now? You told me 
you're a Motion Picture producer.

36:47.434 --> 36:49.658
Any other sober insights 
you'd like to get off your chest?

36:50.092 --> 36:54.217
Yeah, who in the hell would finance 
a million dollar movie with me?

36:54.383 --> 36:57.967
A broke down over the hill man,
doesn't make any sense.

36:58.175 --> 37:00.300
Max is financing it himself, Duke.

37:00.467 --> 37:03.800
He's come into a bunch of money 
and he's putting every dime he has in you.

37:03.925 --> 37:06.675
You really did that?
-Yes, I did.

37:09.383 --> 37:10.675
What, you're stupid?

37:10.800 --> 37:13.258
No, Duke, I'm not stupid at all.
I believe in you.

37:13.425 --> 37:16.184
I believe in Duke Montana.
And I believe your big comeback

37:16.284 --> 37:19.018
is exactly what the world 
wants to see right now.

37:24.423 --> 37:26.279
MIRACLE MOTION PICTURES
MOVIE STUDIO

37:26.675 --> 37:30.133
He is the oldest gun in the West. Right?

37:30.300 --> 37:32.675
Now, he's not what he used to be.

37:32.800 --> 37:36.383
Shaking hands. Failing eyesight.

37:38.034 --> 37:43.300
So I want to shoot the whole movie 
with a camera that is hardly shaking. <i>ja?</i>

37:43.467 --> 37:46.508
The camera... 
it's like it has its Parkinson's disease.

37:46.675 --> 37:48.842
<i>Parkinson Krankheit</i>, you understand?

37:49.008 --> 37:52.784
And all of it should be out of focus, <i>ja?</i>

37:52.986 --> 37:55.108
Just like his failing eyesight.

37:55.633 --> 37:59.425
The whole movie should be shaking 
<i>und</i> out of focus. All of it.

37:59.592 --> 38:01.300
<i> Die ganze zeit. </i>

38:02.300 --> 38:04.800
Yeah, that's a way to go.

38:05.342 --> 38:08.800
Oppression, motherfuckers,
that's what this movie is about.

38:08.967 --> 38:11.542
Indians ain't nothing 
but niggas of the West

38:11.642 --> 38:14.227
oppressed by whitey
and the cavalries of men.

38:14.508 --> 38:20.469
When this white cracker old fame 
motherfucker finds out he's got Indian blood

38:20.830 --> 38:22.895
coursing through his veins. 
What does he do?

38:22.925 --> 38:25.925
He embraces his own inner nigga.

38:26.133 --> 38:30.883
And takes over the goddamn imperialist 
government machine. You smell that?

38:35.633 --> 38:37.675
Smells like an Oscar.

38:42.092 --> 38:45.717
I felt like I really connected 
to this story.

38:45.842 --> 38:48.467
And especially the main character.

38:48.633 --> 38:51.967
As the matter of fact 
my heart broke for him.

38:52.175 --> 38:55.258
It seemed as he was living a lie.

38:55.425 --> 38:59.842
It was as if all along he knew 
that he was something else.

39:00.008 --> 39:04.592
He just didn't know 
how to express it.

39:06.217 --> 39:07.800
I know this character.

39:07.967 --> 39:11.383
I know this character very well.

39:11.550 --> 39:20.133
And I know if you give me the chance
I can do a great job.

39:20.383 --> 39:23.217
But you are a woman.
-So?

39:23.383 --> 39:26.300
No. It's just kinda like 
a guys movie. Right?

39:26.467 --> 39:30.925
We have a lot of gun fights,
big stunts, drinking, womanizing.

39:31.133 --> 39:35.133
But your movie is so much more 
than just that.

39:35.300 --> 39:36.925
Is it?
-Yes.

39:37.508 --> 39:40.300
She'll do. Hire her.

39:40.681 --> 39:43.111
But Duke, with all due respect, 
it's sorta like guys movie.

39:43.211 --> 39:44.925
Yeah. Hire her.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.883
But Duke it's like 
a root-in'-toot western.

39:47.092 --> 39:48.633
It's very masculine.

39:52.717 --> 39:55.467
Okay, our star has spoken.
-Congratulations.

39:55.842 --> 39:58.488
Oh my God. Oh my God.

39:58.758 --> 40:00.842
Thank you guys. Thank you.

40:03.523 --> 40:05.175
You won't be disappointed.

40:10.383 --> 40:12.800
Thank you, Mr. Montana.

40:14.467 --> 40:18.383
When I was a little girl my dad 
would take me to movies to see you.

40:19.258 --> 40:24.550
When you'd appear on screen
he'd say, "Now that is a hero.

40:24.717 --> 40:28.717
That's what a real man 
looks and sound like."

40:29.883 --> 40:31.300
And now I know.

40:31.467 --> 40:34.467
He was right. Thank you.

40:34.842 --> 40:36.467
Thank you guys.

40:41.300 --> 40:42.925
She'll do.

41:04.258 --> 41:06.217
You're sitting all alone?

41:07.258 --> 41:11.092
Uncle Max, I don't know how you did it. 
But once again you pulled it off.

41:11.258 --> 41:12.675
Thank you, Walter.

41:12.800 --> 41:15.467
These people are ready
to die for you.

41:15.633 --> 41:18.342
Not the best choice of words,
but again thank you.

41:18.508 --> 41:22.467
And the setting, the atmosphere... 
It's perfect.

41:22.633 --> 41:25.842
Uncle Eddie would be very proud of us.
-May he rest in peace.

41:26.008 --> 41:26.925
Amen.

41:27.133 --> 41:30.508
By the way, the cherry on top: did you see 
that old drive-in we past on the way up?

41:30.675 --> 41:31.467
No, I didn't.

41:31.675 --> 41:33.789
Well, it's pretty beat up, 
but I asked around.

41:33.889 --> 41:35.159
The projector still works.

41:35.175 --> 41:38.467
We could screen our dailies
underneath the stars.

41:38.633 --> 41:40.258
How great would that be?
-Wonderful.

41:40.425 --> 41:42.331
We should do it!
-Yeah, that's... We will.

41:42.332 --> 41:43.980
Definitely gonna do that.

41:45.008 --> 41:46.322
I'm just so happy.

41:46.422 --> 41:50.371
I've heard this expression before 
but I never understood it until this movie.

41:50.758 --> 41:53.842
I know what they mean 
when they say, "movie magic".

41:54.008 --> 41:56.175
You said it.
-I'm very proud to be your partner.

41:56.342 --> 41:59.508
To success.
-In whatever form she may come.

42:01.675 --> 42:04.165
Mr. Barber? The animal trainer 
is here for you.

42:04.955 --> 42:07.226
Excuse me, Walter.
-Sure. That's exciting.

42:07.842 --> 42:09.967
Hey, Mr. Barber.
-Hey there, Duke.

42:10.175 --> 42:11.717
Everything all right?
-Sure. Fine.

42:11.842 --> 42:13.451
I'm just thinking about having a drink.

42:13.551 --> 42:16.737
Good. Have a whole bunch. 
Charge it all through me.

42:16.758 --> 42:21.342
That's very kind of you, Mr. Barber.
-No problem. My pleasure.

42:21.508 --> 42:24.084
Hey, Mr. Barber, you're paying 
for everyone's drink?

42:24.184 --> 42:25.746
No, not yours.

42:29.592 --> 42:32.925
Max Barber. Bob Stillwater.
-Hey, Bob. Nice to meet you.

42:33.133 --> 42:36.883
Nice to meet you too I guess. Guess what?
-What?

42:37.092 --> 42:40.550
Here he is. This is gonna be 
our stunt horse. Ol' Butterscotch.

42:40.717 --> 42:42.508
Beautiful horse.

42:42.675 --> 42:44.967
He's not just a horse.
-He's not?

42:45.175 --> 42:48.342
No, Butterscotch is a champion, a giant.

42:48.508 --> 42:50.842
He's a legend amongst legends.

42:51.467 --> 42:53.675
John Wayne says it's the greatest horse 
he's ever ridden.

42:53.800 --> 42:55.585
He did?
-Yes, sir.

42:55.705 --> 42:57.216
Wow.
-Yeah.

42:58.217 --> 42:59.754
Tell him, Butterscotch.

42:59.989 --> 43:02.886
Tell Mr. Barber how many movies 
you made with John Wayne.

43:04.217 --> 43:07.258
You see, that'd be one. That would be two.
-Wow.

43:07.425 --> 43:09.717
And that'd be three, and that'd be four.

43:09.842 --> 43:11.550
Four?

43:12.175 --> 43:14.883
Well now he's just lying, 
you stop that, old lad, Butterscotch.

43:15.092 --> 43:16.842
Sometimes he does that. I got you.

43:19.758 --> 43:22.758
Somebody's telling me you wanna know 
everything ol' Butterscotch here can do?

43:22.883 --> 43:26.467
I do, Bob. Why don't we discuss it
over a couple of drinks inside?

43:26.675 --> 43:28.842
You read my mind.

43:30.675 --> 43:32.133
Johnny Carson!

43:35.467 --> 43:37.300
Where the hell is he going?

43:37.633 --> 43:39.342
Where is he going?
-Yeah.

43:39.633 --> 43:42.300
His going back to the trailer. 
To settle in. Take a nap.

43:42.467 --> 43:45.758
To watch "The Tonight Show."
-"The Tonight Show"?

43:45.883 --> 43:47.300
Don Rickles is the guest.

43:47.467 --> 43:51.467
That's gotta be Butterscotch's favorite.
-Who doesn't like Don Rickles?

43:52.800 --> 43:55.633
That's quite the impressive stager
you got there, Bob, I gotta say.

43:55.800 --> 44:01.633
When I saw him take off for his trailer
to catch Carson? This is amazing.

44:01.800 --> 44:05.133
Actually that's just the tip of the iceberg.
-Really?

44:05.300 --> 44:07.857
You should see everything he can do.
-Like what?

44:07.957 --> 44:09.550
Like what?
-Yeah.

44:09.650 --> 44:12.948
Like if you say the word "pumpkin"
he's gonna bow.

44:12.996 --> 44:15.000
He bows?
-Yeah.

44:17.133 --> 44:21.550
And if you say the word "mattress"
he'll lay down.

44:21.717 --> 44:23.133
Impressive.

44:24.925 --> 44:29.383
Listen, if you say the word "rocket"
-Then what?

44:29.550 --> 44:32.467
He's gonna go, like a rocket.

44:35.425 --> 44:38.342
Oh yeah, "Sassafras".
-What happens?

44:38.508 --> 44:40.258
He rears straight up.
-He rears up?

44:40.425 --> 44:41.883
Straight up.

44:43.092 --> 44:45.842
That's something.
-It is something.

44:46.508 --> 44:51.175
I heard there was a word
that if you even suggest,

44:51.342 --> 44:53.633
even the beginning of it, 
that somehow he will just

44:53.800 --> 44:55.383
go apeshit.
- No. No.

44:56.300 --> 44:59.772
You sure man? Just tell me. 
I'm not gonna say anything to anybody.

44:59.872 --> 45:01.826
I'm just curious.
-No, that's too dangerous.

45:02.052 --> 45:03.255
You gonna get somebody hurt.

45:03.258 --> 45:06.717
I'll take my chances.
-Are you sure?

45:07.258 --> 45:09.327
I'll never say in front of him.
I'm just curious.

45:09.383 --> 45:12.925
Listen, if you that stupid.

45:13.342 --> 45:15.800
Rhubarb.
-Rhubarb?

45:15.967 --> 45:19.467
Rhubarb.
-What happens?

45:19.758 --> 45:22.675
No. You don't wanna go there.

45:25.842 --> 45:28.342
Hey, would you give a light to me?

45:34.967 --> 45:40.383
Man, thank you so much.
Look at you. Very good for you, man.

45:44.217 --> 45:45.300
To Butterscotch.

45:45.467 --> 45:47.467
Yeah, to Butterscotch.

45:53.467 --> 45:54.467
Amazing horse.

45:54.633 --> 45:59.300
I just gotta make a couple of notes 
about tomorrow's shootings. Give me a sec.

46:07.340 --> 46:09.578
RHUBARB - INSANE

46:13.092 --> 46:15.675
I wanna thank you, sir.
-About what?

46:15.800 --> 46:19.842
You know I am grateful, Mr. Barber.
I think I've been a little bit tough on you.

46:20.008 --> 46:23.842
I find most producers to be the lowest 
form of human life imaginable.

46:23.914 --> 46:25.858
People who'd throw their own mother 
out of the window

46:25.958 --> 46:27.627
just for a ham sandwich.

46:27.633 --> 46:31.217
You sir, you're different.
-Thank you, Duke.

46:31.383 --> 46:35.425
If it wasn't for you I'd be 
six feet under on Bainville right now.

46:37.641 --> 46:39.847
ROCKET - LIKE LIGHTNING
SASSAFRAS

46:40.883 --> 46:44.425
Kalispell, just outside Whitefish.
You ever heard of it?

46:44.592 --> 46:45.508
No, I didn't. Sorry.

46:45.675 --> 46:48.523
My dad raised me
to be a farmer, not a cowboy.

46:48.623 --> 46:54.340
We raised wheat, barley, lentils, garlic.

46:54.883 --> 46:58.092
Sugar beets the size of a pumpkin.
Home made.

46:58.550 --> 46:59.999
Not kidding? Wow.

47:00.038 --> 47:02.823
Listen, I have a very important note 
I have to write here.

47:02.842 --> 47:05.092
How can I help you?
- It's for my mother.

47:05.258 --> 47:09.967
What I'm talking about is the smell
of rhododendrons, Mr. Barber.

47:10.175 --> 47:13.508
The lonesome cry
of the mysterious coyote.

47:13.675 --> 47:17.175
Indians. Missouri Braves.

47:17.342 --> 47:19.508
That's nice.
-Wigwams.

47:20.225 --> 47:22.425
I have no idea what you're saying 
but sounds nice.

47:22.592 --> 47:26.912
What I'm trying to say, Mr. Barber 
is that you are a cool drink

47:27.012 --> 47:28.598
of Shayan Spring water

47:28.675 --> 47:32.800
after a long gallop 
across the golden arid prairie.

47:32.925 --> 47:33.842
Thanks. Thanks.

47:35.586 --> 47:36.472
Jesus.

47:36.675 --> 47:38.800
Excuse me.

47:40.133 --> 47:41.842
Big help, thank you.

47:44.675 --> 47:46.217
Thanks.

48:07.925 --> 48:09.402
Over there.
-Perfect.

48:09.875 --> 48:11.673
Megan, are you sure 
you wanna shoot that way?

48:11.773 --> 48:13.377
You'll be shooting directly into the sun.

48:13.477 --> 48:17.342
I want my star backlit. 
I want him to look glorious.

48:17.758 --> 48:19.717
Now put the camera right there.
-Yes. Perfect.

48:19.842 --> 48:21.375
Megan, hi, all the wagons are brown.

48:21.475 --> 48:23.830
Can we just please add 
a splash color in there somewhere?

48:23.930 --> 48:25.967
No, Danny, I want them to look real.

48:26.175 --> 48:29.842
Dirty. Like the wagons have traveled 
hundreds of miles across the plains.

48:30.008 --> 48:33.717
Got it. More brown.
Why am I even here?

48:33.842 --> 48:36.508
All right everyone, we better get 
this film finished. Let's go!

48:36.675 --> 48:37.592
That's our first shot.

48:37.758 --> 48:40.758
Yeah, when I say "finished" I mean 
one step closer to the end. That's good.

48:40.883 --> 48:43.258
Max, we need to have a safety meeting.
-Good idea.

48:43.425 --> 48:44.342
Like now?

48:44.508 --> 48:46.092
Hey, Duke?
-Yo!

48:46.550 --> 48:49.508
We gonna start filming now. 
You might hop in on ol' Butterscotch here?

48:49.675 --> 48:51.425
I'll be right there.

49:00.633 --> 49:01.633
Where's Bob?

49:01.800 --> 49:03.251
Bob's not feeling so great today,

49:03.351 --> 49:06.013
but don't worry he told me everything 
we need to know.

49:10.092 --> 49:11.800
Are you sure? Is that safe?

49:11.967 --> 49:14.006
Walter, are you questioning 
my professionalism

49:14.106 --> 49:15.288
and my dedication to my craft?

49:15.383 --> 49:17.258
Who hasn't seen an accident 
in over a year?

49:17.425 --> 49:19.190
Our last film wrapped 
a year and a half ago.

49:19.217 --> 49:21.717
Irrelevant. And even if something 
were to happen, which it won't

49:21.842 --> 49:25.425
we have the best set medic 
in Hollywood standing by right over there.

49:30.175 --> 49:31.592
Mattress!

49:44.058 --> 49:46.330
I'll ask you next time 
to get all of your facts straight

49:46.430 --> 49:48.919
before you attempt 
to slander my good name, Walter.

49:49.008 --> 49:50.258
Sorry.

49:55.175 --> 49:57.342
Are you sure you gonna be able 
to do this stunt, Duke?

49:57.508 --> 50:00.008
Of course he can do this stunt.
He's Duke Montana.

50:00.217 --> 50:01.967
I'll be fine.

50:03.717 --> 50:06.633
You know you look pretty handsome
up there on that horse.

50:10.383 --> 50:12.217
Let's make a movie.

50:16.467 --> 50:18.800
Hold up! That's my horse!
-Everybody's set to one?

50:18.967 --> 50:20.217
Picture's up!

50:20.383 --> 50:23.127
Megan, I have an idea 
if I may suggest something?

50:23.227 --> 50:24.089
Sure, Max.

50:24.092 --> 50:25.833
I was thinking instead of just 
a simple jump

50:25.933 --> 50:28.339
why don't we make this look 
really spectacular?

50:28.425 --> 50:29.675
I'm listening.

50:29.800 --> 50:32.423
This being the first shot of our movie 
and the introduction of Duke,

50:32.523 --> 50:34.779
instead of him just galloping along 
and jumping into frame

50:34.879 --> 50:36.857
why don't we do it through a wall of fire?

50:36.957 --> 50:40.675
Let's set the wagons in blazing, and Duke 
and his beloved Steve jump through the flames

50:40.800 --> 50:45.008
sail through the air and land right 
into a Close up to save the settlers.

50:45.217 --> 50:46.342
That sounds very dangerous.

50:46.508 --> 50:51.383
That sounds great.
Get those wagons lit.

50:51.550 --> 50:53.717
Great, set 'em in blaze.
That'll be some color.

50:53.842 --> 50:56.786
Are you sure we shouldn't talk 
to trainers about this? It's very dangerous.

50:56.788 --> 50:58.209
Usually we rehearse with the horse--

50:58.309 --> 50:59.432
Walter. Walter.

50:59.467 --> 51:02.967
For the last time, would you
stop the fucking bothering me.

51:09.508 --> 51:11.800
Ready and...

51:12.467 --> 51:13.467
Action!

52:19.175 --> 52:20.800
Duke! Medic!

52:21.133 --> 52:24.675
Awful hand of fate
that has dealt us these cards

52:24.800 --> 52:27.800
I can see it now 
in your obituary in Variety.

52:27.967 --> 52:30.717
"Duke Montana, he died with his boots on."

52:30.842 --> 52:33.300
If you were alive right now,
I know he would be saying--

52:33.467 --> 52:35.467
Where's that damn horse at?

52:37.300 --> 52:39.842
Duke? My God, you're alive!

52:40.008 --> 52:41.758
There you are.

52:42.300 --> 52:43.432
If I come off you again

52:43.532 --> 52:47.018
me and you are actually gonna have 
some feisty cups. Is that clear?

52:47.092 --> 52:50.425
All right then. Let's do this again. 
Wardrobe?

52:50.592 --> 52:52.800
Try to stay handy, will ya?
-Duke, are you sure?

52:52.925 --> 52:57.175
Hell yes, I'm sure, 
I just need to talk to my director.

52:58.133 --> 53:00.018
Oh my God, that was so close.

53:00.118 --> 53:02.620
Yeah, that was close. 
That could've been a big tragedy.

53:03.311 --> 53:04.832
We could've had a big tragedy.

53:05.008 --> 53:07.508
We're so lucky.
-We are lucky. Yeah.

53:07.717 --> 53:09.467
Reset. Let's go again.

53:09.633 --> 53:10.883
Back to one!

53:11.302 --> 53:12.218
And...

53:12.300 --> 53:13.758
Action!

53:59.675 --> 54:00.800
Cut!

54:01.383 --> 54:03.425
Perfect. Great.

54:04.092 --> 54:05.592
Moving on!

54:08.092 --> 54:11.717
Shouldn't we just get one more, 
for safety, for protection?

54:11.842 --> 54:14.761
And maybe we should set up 
an even bigger bigger fire

54:14.961 --> 54:16.708
to make it more effective?

54:16.743 --> 54:19.508
We can at least try that.
-I like what I've got. We're moving.

54:19.675 --> 54:21.800
I'm really starting to like her.
She's very decisive.

54:21.967 --> 54:25.842
Hey, Duke! Great job out there.
I like what you're doing.

54:26.008 --> 54:31.300
Can I get you anything, 
like a root beer with sassafras?

54:32.925 --> 54:35.008
No, sir. I don't care for root beer.

54:35.062 --> 54:37.558
How about something for lunch? 
How about lentil soup?

54:37.658 --> 54:39.746
I like beets well. I'd like a lentil soup.

54:40.925 --> 54:42.508
How about pumpkin?

54:45.967 --> 54:48.550
With lentils? No, thank you, sir.

54:52.092 --> 54:54.217
What do you look so happy about?

54:59.217 --> 55:00.925
Rodent?

55:01.175 --> 55:03.175
Rhapsody?

55:08.217 --> 55:09.246
Rotor? Runner?

55:10.021 --> 55:10.665
Rhubarb?

55:26.342 --> 55:28.487
Jesus, Uncle Max, are you okay?

55:28.982 --> 55:31.029
You took off like a rocket.

55:37.175 --> 55:42.342
My horse? My Butterscotch?
Just like that gone?

55:42.508 --> 55:45.675
That horse looked up to me
like I was his father.

55:46.383 --> 55:48.383
And I looked at him like he was my son.

55:48.675 --> 55:51.508
Don't worry, Bob. We're insured.
-Insured?

55:51.675 --> 55:54.675
Did you realize my horse is priceless?

55:55.133 --> 55:58.217
And I wanna sue you. 
And I'm gonna sue you.

55:58.373 --> 56:02.369
And whoever else is responsible 
in financing this debacle

56:02.644 --> 56:04.657
for every pity you worth.

56:10.717 --> 56:12.258
What's his problem?

56:12.425 --> 56:13.550
I don't know.

56:14.918 --> 56:17.550
On the bright sight this is 
one of our best first days ever.

56:17.717 --> 56:21.508
Best? What are you talking about?

56:22.342 --> 56:25.049
We lost our featured horse, 
we're getting sued,

56:25.099 --> 56:26.567
I got ejected from my own feet.

56:26.675 --> 56:29.508
Duke Montana is still...
- Still what? Still as good as ever?

56:29.612 --> 56:31.551
Because he was incredible today.

56:31.651 --> 56:33.591
And Megan said 
she's got some fantastic stuff.

56:33.675 --> 56:34.836
What the hell does she know?

56:34.936 --> 56:37.888
I have no idea, you're the one who wanted 
to hire her. But she's our director.

56:38.758 --> 56:41.633
I'm not talking to anybody.
You hear me? Nobody.

56:41.800 --> 56:43.972
I don't care if it's a Christ 
on a cross. Nobody.

56:44.017 --> 56:45.305
Okay. I'll get it.

56:45.342 --> 56:46.925
Hello?

56:47.342 --> 56:49.675
It's Reggie Fontaine.
-Give me the phone

56:49.800 --> 56:52.758
Hey, Reggie. How are you?

56:52.883 --> 56:56.925
Thanks for calling.
-So... the cowboy?

56:57.383 --> 56:58.342
Dead, right?

56:58.508 --> 57:00.300
No, well, not...

57:00.467 --> 57:02.181
Why do you mean "no"?

57:02.989 --> 57:05.491
You said "dead". You said "dead by noon".

57:05.508 --> 57:06.342
"Dead"!

57:06.508 --> 57:08.758
Like William Holden in "Sunset Boulevard".

57:10.176 --> 57:12.925
Oh, no. He's doing great actually.

57:13.217 --> 57:15.592
You should've seen him. 
He's like amazing.

57:15.758 --> 57:17.468
Jumping the horse like he was only 50.

57:17.599 --> 57:19.984
It was really something to see.

57:20.008 --> 57:24.008
I don't wanna hear that shit!
I wanna hear that he died tragically!

57:24.442 --> 57:26.342
We gonna make that happen, 
Reggie, wait and see.

57:26.508 --> 57:29.143
Tomorrow we're shooting 
this fantastic rope bridge scene.

57:29.555 --> 57:31.512
You've never seen the chasm this deep.

57:32.300 --> 57:35.342
It's gonna be a real killer.
Wait and see.

57:35.675 --> 57:39.145
It better be, because if not 
I'm gonna hunt you down.

57:39.746 --> 57:42.626
I'm gonna hunt you down like 
Lefors did with Newman and Redford

57:42.726 --> 57:45.520
in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid". 
You hear me?

57:48.217 --> 57:51.967
Thank you, Reggie, thank you, and again, 
thanks for the call. It was very nice of you.

57:52.342 --> 57:56.342
Reggie I told you I never trusted 
that motherfucker.

58:00.633 --> 58:02.217
A little support.

58:02.467 --> 58:05.175
Why the hell is Reggie Fontaine calling you?
-What?

58:05.342 --> 58:09.967
Why is Reggie Fontaine calling you?
-I don't think I like your tone.

58:10.175 --> 58:12.720
I'm sorry but I wanna know 
why he's calling you.

58:13.082 --> 58:14.128
-What do you think?

58:14.133 --> 58:16.175
I have no idea, that's why I'm asking.

58:16.342 --> 58:19.258
I'll tell you why. Because the word 
must already be out there.

58:19.425 --> 58:20.342
What word?

58:20.508 --> 58:23.165
The word that every producer wants to hear

58:23.265 --> 58:26.596
being said about their movie 
on the first day of production.

58:26.633 --> 58:29.004
I have no idea. What's the freaking word?
-Hit!

58:29.173 --> 58:32.175
No.
-Yes, Walter. Hit.

58:32.592 --> 58:34.133
And that's what we've got.
-Really?

58:34.300 --> 58:36.758
A hit. It's already on the street.

58:36.925 --> 58:39.300
Already on the lips of people who know.

58:39.467 --> 58:43.175
Being whispered like the wind 
in every corner of Tinseltown.

58:43.342 --> 58:48.300
And it's obvious that Mr. Fontaine is trying 
to work his way back into my good graces

58:48.452 --> 58:50.213
but you heard what I said. 
I was nice to him.

58:50.313 --> 58:52.859
But I really was telling him 
to go fuck himself.

58:53.595 --> 58:56.409
Yes! A hit. I knew it!

58:56.593 --> 58:57.820
I was feeling it.

58:57.920 --> 58:59.438
I'm so proud of you.

58:59.740 --> 59:02.726
If I have to be honest, I thought 
you're up to something shady again.

59:03.383 --> 59:06.758
I'll forgive you this time, Walter.
-Thank you.

59:47.941 --> 59:50.597
Forest. Forest. How much? 
What are we looking at?

59:54.698 --> 59:56.892
... You gotta hang in there, 
we're gonna get to you soon.

59:59.092 --> 01:00:02.675
Great job on bridge.
-Sure. More brown.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.800
No. It's beautiful.

01:00:04.967 --> 01:00:08.592
I'm sorry, I'm actually seeing 
someone else right now.

01:00:09.967 --> 01:00:13.342
Can I talk to you fellas for a minute?
-Sure, Duke. What can we do for you?

01:00:13.508 --> 01:00:15.130
I'm not too sure how to say this.

01:00:15.837 --> 01:00:18.606
Duke, you can tell us anything, so...
-All right then.

01:00:19.925 --> 01:00:22.967
I really don't wanna 
get out there on that bridge.

01:00:23.985 --> 01:00:26.463
But Duke, this is the scene 
where you cross the gorge

01:00:26.633 --> 01:00:29.175
into the sacred and forbidden
Indian burial ground

01:00:29.342 --> 01:00:32.092
where you awaken the spirit 
of your great-grandfather,

01:00:32.258 --> 01:00:34.744
therefore revealing to your character 
and the audience

01:00:34.844 --> 01:00:36.912
that you're actually 1/8 Indian.

01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:39.862
I don't care why I'm crossing 
the goddamn gorge. I don't like heights.

01:00:39.962 --> 01:00:42.800
The great Duke Montana
doesn't like heights?

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:46.000
That right there is the reason 
I don't ever tell anybody about it.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:46.932
But Duke. Look...

01:00:47.258 --> 01:00:50.098
If we are to get this 
incredibly poignant and important scene.

01:00:50.198 --> 01:00:52.515
That one that would win you 
your Academy Award

01:00:52.615 --> 01:00:54.434
if you want that, and I know you do.

01:00:54.925 --> 01:00:57.508
There's no way that you can't cross 
that bridge.

01:00:57.675 --> 01:00:59.008
You have to cross that bridge.

01:00:59.098 --> 01:01:01.213
That's easy enough to say 
from where you're standing.

01:01:01.313 --> 01:01:04.378
I'll see you fellas when you find a new way 
for me to reach the burial ground.

01:01:04.425 --> 01:01:07.633
Perhaps some of the liquid courage 
would help? What do you think?

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:09.633
You sure?
-No!

01:01:10.425 --> 01:01:13.516
You know what, Duke, you're right.
It is easy to say from where we're standing.

01:01:13.542 --> 01:01:14.616
But look.

01:01:17.579 --> 01:01:20.022
Walter, what are you doing?
-Don't worry, Uncle Max.

01:01:20.133 --> 01:01:21.925
Yeah, but what are you doing?
-Don't worry.

01:01:22.133 --> 01:01:23.842
Walter.

01:01:24.008 --> 01:01:26.425
See, Duke? It's perfectly safe.

01:01:26.592 --> 01:01:30.967
Sure, when you're that close to solid ground. 
But what about out in the middle?

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.758
All right...
-Is this really necessary?

01:01:34.883 --> 01:01:37.758
It's okay, Uncle Max.
-Is this really necessary?

01:01:38.467 --> 01:01:39.367
It's good.

01:01:39.467 --> 01:01:41.883
I like the man who puts his money 
where his mouth is.

01:01:42.008 --> 01:01:44.211
Are you convinced 
that it's safe now, Duke? Look.

01:01:44.311 --> 01:01:45.956
No, how about a little further out?

01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:47.675
Okay...

01:01:49.342 --> 01:01:50.300
No, Walter!

01:01:52.467 --> 01:01:53.967
Walter.

01:01:54.467 --> 01:01:55.508
Now?

01:01:56.008 --> 01:01:58.633
No, get further down out there.

01:01:59.188 --> 01:02:02.441
Walter! Walter! Enough. Stop!

01:02:02.726 --> 01:02:04.682
The scene is not worth it. Come back.

01:02:05.175 --> 01:02:08.967
It's okay, Uncle Max. It doesn't matter.
We can't shot down.

01:02:09.175 --> 01:02:14.217
We're making the greatest movie ever.
It's totally fine.

01:02:16.133 --> 01:02:19.217
That is the kind of passion 
and commitment to the project

01:02:19.317 --> 01:02:20.645
that gets my blood boiling.

01:02:20.675 --> 01:02:25.592
You have yourself a scene, Mr. Barber.
-You got this, Duke!

01:02:27.258 --> 01:02:30.675
Okay...
-Let's shoot.

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:33.550
Rolling.

01:02:33.641 --> 01:02:34.826
And...

01:02:34.883 --> 01:02:36.592
Action!

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.342
This is gonna be great. Watch this.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.383
Oh no.

01:03:20.967 --> 01:03:22.425
What are you talking about? This is great.

01:03:22.592 --> 01:03:23.906
No... yeah... sure.

01:03:39.217 --> 01:03:40.758
Cut! Reset!

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:44.300
Let's go again.
-Back to one!

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:50.467
Hurry up, people!
-Listen to the lady Director!

01:03:51.675 --> 01:03:54.300
<i>Mach schnell</i> ! Come on!

01:04:00.925 --> 01:04:03.133
I think I'm over my fear of heights!

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.247
Yeah, Duke!
-That's great, Duke!

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:09.967
Duke Montana is not afraid of heights!

01:04:11.717 --> 01:04:12.967
Run!

01:04:13.175 --> 01:04:14.758
Roll the fucking camera!
-Yes. Yes. Quickly!

01:04:16.467 --> 01:04:17.925
Everybody clear the bridge!

01:04:27.508 --> 01:04:29.508
Oh my God!

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.925
Duke!

01:05:01.638 --> 01:05:02.800
Yeah, Duke Montana!

01:05:02.925 --> 01:05:04.217
Cut!

01:05:06.425 --> 01:05:09.141
I know. I know. 
Tell me you got it.

01:05:09.233 --> 01:05:10.811
We got it? Yes!

01:05:11.258 --> 01:05:14.342
Duke Montana, people! Duke Montana!

01:05:19.842 --> 01:05:21.758
Good job, Duke.

01:05:23.133 --> 01:05:24.587
<i>I am Duke Montana.</i>

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:27.864
<i>I'm here to talk to you 
about my good friends</i>

01:05:29.317 --> 01:05:32.213
<i>from the Rio Grande 
to the Rocky Mountains...</i>

01:05:34.008 --> 01:05:37.425
Hello?
-Who the fuck is Butterscotch?

01:05:37.592 --> 01:05:38.508
What?

01:05:38.675 --> 01:05:42.800
Who the fuck is Butterscotch?

01:05:44.217 --> 01:05:45.800
He's a horse.

01:05:45.967 --> 01:05:49.266
I'm being sued for a million dollars
because you lost a fucking horse

01:05:49.366 --> 01:05:50.535
named Butterscotch?

01:05:50.758 --> 01:05:55.133
No, we'll find him.
-You goddamn right you'll find him.

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:59.175
And what about the fucking cowboy?
No, let me guess: not dead.

01:06:00.258 --> 01:06:01.383
No.

01:06:02.133 --> 01:06:03.800
Max?

01:06:05.967 --> 01:06:07.717
If you're fucking around with me

01:06:08.717 --> 01:06:10.508
I swear for God, Max

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:13.300
I'm gonna throw your ass 
off the roof.

01:06:13.467 --> 01:06:16.258
Reggie I promise you
I'm doing my best.

01:06:16.425 --> 01:06:18.842
It's not that hard
to kill somebody!

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:21.800
Fair enough. But you don't know this guy.
He's got like nine lives, Reggie.

01:06:21.925 --> 01:06:26.863
Shoot him, strangle him, poison him.
I don't give a fuck how you'll do it!

01:06:27.286 --> 01:06:28.517
But do it!

01:06:29.325 --> 01:06:31.381
If not I'm gonna come out there 
and do it myself.

01:06:31.481 --> 01:06:33.778
And when I'm done with him 
I'll be starting on you.

01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:42.758
This motherfucker hung up on me.

01:07:03.862 --> 01:07:04.970
Hey!

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:09.549
Look who's here. Butterscotch!

01:07:09.925 --> 01:07:13.258
I'm so happy to see you. Come on.
Do you wanna watch the show?

01:07:13.425 --> 01:07:16.467
Rodney Dangerfield,
Dr. Joyce Brothers.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.633
Anthony Newley.
"What Kind Of Fool Am I"

01:07:20.883 --> 01:07:23.300
It's okay, come on.

01:07:24.675 --> 01:07:26.383
What are you thinking?

01:07:27.675 --> 01:07:31.425
He's good too, you're gonna enjoy him.
Come on.

01:07:31.842 --> 01:07:32.967
What?

01:07:36.717 --> 01:07:38.967
Fuck you, Butterscotch!

01:07:46.467 --> 01:07:48.342
There you go.

01:07:48.508 --> 01:07:50.231
Nice horse. Nice horse.

01:07:52.041 --> 01:07:54.268
That's it. That's it.

01:07:55.717 --> 01:07:57.342
Good horse.

01:08:05.758 --> 01:08:09.175
Thanks for coming back, Bob.
I really appreciate it.

01:08:09.342 --> 01:08:11.800
Yeah? But I'm still suing you.

01:08:11.967 --> 01:08:15.800
Do what you gotta do.
Tell me about old Mordecai here.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:20.341
Mordecai comes from a very long 
prestigious line of bulls.

01:08:24.925 --> 01:08:26.828
Do you realize who his 
great-grandfather was?

01:08:26.983 --> 01:08:27.627
No.

01:08:27.728 --> 01:08:30.175
El Jefe José Gonzales.

01:08:30.631 --> 01:08:33.256
And he's a bad son of a bitch.
-Really?

01:08:33.425 --> 01:08:37.091
Killed 14 of them damn matadors 
in less than 3 weeks.

01:08:38.966 --> 01:08:43.466
So Mordecai charges 
whenever he sees the color... red?

01:08:44.466 --> 01:08:46.627
Jesus Christ! Come here!

01:08:46.731 --> 01:08:50.045
Don't ever let me hear you say that word 
around him again, do you understand me?

01:08:50.466 --> 01:08:52.716
I'm the only one here 
who can control that big bastard.

01:08:52.841 --> 01:08:55.841
He goes ballistic and crazy 
if he just sees that color.

01:08:56.006 --> 01:08:58.341
And you need to tell your crew about that.

01:08:58.506 --> 01:09:01.381
I told everybody 
to stay clear of Mordecai here.

01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:04.006
That's good.
-What's the story on this bull?

01:09:04.216 --> 01:09:05.716
Excuse me.

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:08.828
Duke, this is the scene 
where the cowboys fight the Indians

01:09:08.848 --> 01:09:10.483
over the bull that they stole from them.

01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:13.081
I know what this scene is about 
it just doesn't make any sense.

01:09:13.081 --> 01:09:13.693
I'm sorry.

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:16.622
Why in the world would an Indian 
steal a white man's bull

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.899
when there're 3 million buffaloes 
standing out there?

01:09:18.925 --> 01:09:22.631
That's a good point, but let's just focus 
on today's work, can we do that?

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:25.069
Fine, tell me about the bull 
that doesn't make any sense.

01:09:25.099 --> 01:09:28.131
He's a Stunt Bull. He looks mean
but he wouldn't harm a fly.

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.675
Sounds hanky.
-Hanky?

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:33.341
As in "ridiculous".
-It's the newest thing, Duke.

01:09:33.506 --> 01:09:35.591
You've been out 
of the business for a long time.

01:09:35.756 --> 01:09:38.925
Believe me, Duke 
this is the state of the art.

01:09:39.381 --> 01:09:43.091
By the way, where is that big beautiful 
bright red hat that I gave you?

01:09:43.256 --> 01:09:46.116
I like my hat. I gave the red one 
to that little kid down there.

01:09:46.216 --> 01:09:47.885
What? What kid?

01:09:48.809 --> 01:09:50.194
Walter. Walter.
-Yes.

01:09:51.212 --> 01:09:52.090
What's with the kid?

01:09:52.091 --> 01:09:55.550
Megan had a great idea this morning. 
Instead of Duke just facing off the bull

01:09:55.717 --> 01:09:59.383
first he's gonna rescue 
that little boy named Lyle.

01:09:59.675 --> 01:10:01.675
What?
-Isn't that exciting?

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:05.258
Why didn't you tell me this?
-It's gonna be great. You gonna love it.

01:10:05.425 --> 01:10:07.800
We're in position!
-Looking good, Lyle!

01:10:09.675 --> 01:10:11.133
Rolling!

01:10:14.633 --> 01:10:17.342
Ready. And action!

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:23.967
And action, Duke!

01:10:28.717 --> 01:10:30.758
Hurry up!

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:33.258
Come on. What's the matter with you?

01:10:39.717 --> 01:10:40.675
Shit!

01:10:45.415 --> 01:10:46.632
Harriet! No!

01:10:47.342 --> 01:10:48.592
No!

01:10:49.227 --> 01:10:50.466
Harriet! No!

01:10:51.535 --> 01:10:52.664
No no!

01:10:57.244 --> 01:10:58.468
No no!

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:16.008
Hey Look! Butterscotch!

01:11:54.633 --> 01:11:57.258
Stunt bull my ass.

01:11:57.675 --> 01:11:59.300
Get out of here.

01:12:00.425 --> 01:12:01.842
And cut!

01:12:03.258 --> 01:12:05.008
Hey, Mr. Barber, can I get you anything?

01:12:14.925 --> 01:12:17.633
Uncle Max, you're sure are light 
on your feet.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.258
I gotta tell you almost dodged that bull.

01:12:22.217 --> 01:12:25.008
Lie down, get your feet up.

01:12:25.342 --> 01:12:26.967
Fucking thing looked like Satan.

01:12:27.175 --> 01:12:31.258
On the bright side, Butterscotch coming back 
is something we never could've planned.

01:12:31.425 --> 01:12:35.736
And I was thinking, it totally encapsulates
the heroic nature of Duke

01:12:35.936 --> 01:12:37.884
and the Indians, and the town's people.

01:12:37.984 --> 01:12:40.559
And even Megan said 
it's some of the best stuff we've gotten.

01:12:40.559 --> 01:12:41.984
Yeah. Fucking fabulous.

01:12:42.842 --> 01:12:45.094
There's a note here from Reggie Fontaine.

01:12:45.191 --> 01:12:48.552
Don't worry it's Morgan News, 
he says he's gonna come to set tomorrow

01:12:48.652 --> 01:12:51.348
to make sure we end up 
on the front page of the trades.

01:12:52.675 --> 01:12:54.087
Can you believe that?

01:12:54.243 --> 01:12:58.706
He's sure as nice to go out of his way to 
help out on a movie he's not even involved in.

01:13:05.717 --> 01:13:07.717
Duke, whatever happened to you?

01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:12.842
I don't know. I think
I'd rather not talk about it.

01:13:13.633 --> 01:13:15.071
But you know what,

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:17.526
I'd really like to know.

01:13:18.508 --> 01:13:23.883
If all of my years have taught me anything 
is that you have to be what you are.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.842
With no apology.

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.675
Even when there ain't no role to play.

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:00.758
All I want to do is make movies.

01:14:15.633 --> 01:14:18.175
Fuck you. 
You should be dead now.

01:14:18.342 --> 01:14:21.342
No matter what you think you saw
I was not talking to that horse.

01:14:21.967 --> 01:14:24.717
Come here I gotta show you something.
You not gonna believe this.

01:14:24.842 --> 01:14:26.842
Just come with me. 
I gotta surprise for you.

01:14:27.508 --> 01:14:29.217
You gotta see this.

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:31.800
Come here.

01:14:32.092 --> 01:14:35.133
Walter, I have absolutely no interest 
whatsoever in seeing this.

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:36.258
Start it up.
-Please.

01:14:36.425 --> 01:14:38.092
Just trust me. Start it up.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.467
Oh my God.
-I know, Uncle Max.

01:14:48.633 --> 01:14:51.300
Oh my God.
-I know, Uncle Max.

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:56.008
Did you just see what he...
-It's incredible.

01:14:56.967 --> 01:14:58.508
Oh my God.
-I know.

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:05.425
It's a hit...
It's a bona fide hit.

01:15:05.717 --> 01:15:07.967
It's wonderful. It's breathtaking.

01:15:08.633 --> 01:15:10.096
It's Duke Montana...

01:15:11.046 --> 01:15:12.923
I've never seen him more virile.

01:15:12.967 --> 01:15:14.675
More alive. My God.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.573
Oh my God...
-What? What?

01:15:17.606 --> 01:15:19.056
Oh my God. Oh my God.

01:15:19.156 --> 01:15:20.342
Duke!

01:15:20.508 --> 01:15:22.342
Harriet, where's Duke?
Where's Duke?

01:15:22.383 --> 01:15:24.743
I don't know, Mr. Barber, 
I think he went to his trailer.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.633
What's going on?
-Stay there! Stay over there!

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.758
Stay back!

01:15:27.883 --> 01:15:28.967
Duke!

01:15:29.175 --> 01:15:32.064
Oh my God. Duke, where are you? Duke!

01:15:32.868 --> 01:15:33.802
Duke!

01:15:35.967 --> 01:15:37.508
Hey, there you are!

01:15:38.846 --> 01:15:40.175
I wanna ask you something.

01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:56.842
You've been trying to kill Duke Montana.

01:15:57.008 --> 01:15:59.425
What?
-You heard me.

01:16:00.758 --> 01:16:02.258
Who are you?

01:16:02.717 --> 01:16:06.425
You don't have an amnesia,
you lying son of a bitch.

01:16:06.779 --> 01:16:09.865
Is that how you talk to your own flesh and
blood who's just coming out of a coma?

01:16:09.928 --> 01:16:10.925
A coma?

01:16:11.842 --> 01:16:13.417
You've only been out for three hours.

01:16:13.425 --> 01:16:15.936
You never had any intention 
of making a great movie.

01:16:16.036 --> 01:16:18.327
You are incapable of making a great movie.

01:16:18.377 --> 01:16:21.592
You just wanted to take the easy way out
and cash in on the insurance.

01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:23.425
And that's why you invested
your own money.

01:16:23.592 --> 01:16:26.675
Just the idea that you were 
never even gonna tell me any of this.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:29.258
I didn't think you'd approve.
-Of course I don't approve.

01:16:29.425 --> 01:16:32.013
You see? Keeping you in the dark 
was the best thing for all of us.

01:16:32.113 --> 01:16:33.477
Not Duke!
-Duke?

01:16:33.592 --> 01:16:36.071
Duke got a gun in his mouth 
when we met him. He wanted to die.

01:16:36.171 --> 01:16:39.258
We gave him the greatest gift of all - 
the will to live again.

01:16:39.425 --> 01:16:42.842
An besides, you know what
this is really all your fault.

01:16:43.008 --> 01:16:43.667
What?

01:16:43.699 --> 01:16:45.592
You're the one who killed Frank Pierce.

01:16:45.758 --> 01:16:47.511
You are the one 
who wanted to go on the set.

01:16:47.611 --> 01:16:50.423
And you are the one who put 
that idea into my head in the first place.

01:16:50.523 --> 01:16:53.425
Your ability to twist things around
is incredible.

01:16:53.592 --> 01:16:55.670
How you can just... You... You...

01:16:55.770 --> 01:17:00.217
You cherrypick information and you just 
mold it into whatever you want.

01:17:00.383 --> 01:17:02.675
It's truly incredible. How do you do it?

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.834
I gotta know because you make...

01:17:05.338 --> 01:17:07.218
You make greed seem palatable.

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:11.592
You make murder seem just... 
you know... It's well...

01:17:11.758 --> 01:17:14.092
What kind of a human being are you?

01:17:14.258 --> 01:17:16.842
Well, I'm a producer, Walter.
That's my gift.

01:17:17.137 --> 01:17:19.427
You're nothing more 
than a garden variety of psychopath.

01:17:19.427 --> 01:17:21.976
That is finally becoming clear to me.

01:17:23.092 --> 01:17:26.258
My God, gambling on this insanity 
with your own money

01:17:26.425 --> 01:17:30.383
is the only quasi respectable thing 
you've done this entire shoot.

01:17:37.925 --> 01:17:40.092
You're not gambling with your own money?

01:17:41.717 --> 01:17:45.758
Please tell me you didn't get us 
into the bed with Reggie Fontaine again.

01:17:46.342 --> 01:17:49.175
Oh my God!
-That's my line.

01:17:49.342 --> 01:17:52.557
What happened to all the money you got 
from selling "Paradise" to Jimmy Moore?

01:17:52.657 --> 01:17:55.467
I never signed that contract.
I told him to go fuck himself.

01:17:55.633 --> 01:17:57.758
Why would you do that?
-Why would I do that?

01:17:57.883 --> 01:18:00.753
He doesn't deserve that script.
He's beneath that script.

01:18:00.853 --> 01:18:02.330
I'll never let him have that script.

01:18:02.342 --> 01:18:05.790
I'll take that script to my grave 
before I would let him have that script.

01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:06.791
Are you kidding me?

01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:08.550
You are an insane person.

01:18:08.565 --> 01:18:10.934
Fine, Walter, sticks and stones. 
Call me whatever you want.

01:18:10.967 --> 01:18:12.848
But we need to protect our movie right now.

01:18:13.165 --> 01:18:16.401
We are on the precipice
of greatness of cinematic glory

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:18.925
or dare I say it?
Academy Awards.

01:18:19.133 --> 01:18:22.175
There's only one thing stopping us now.

01:18:23.235 --> 01:18:26.258
That Reggie Fontaine is on his way
to kill Duke Montana himself.

01:18:26.425 --> 01:18:28.633
And possibly you and me.

01:18:29.383 --> 01:18:31.633
Help me find my shoes, where are they?

01:18:38.383 --> 01:18:42.092
What are you doing there, Sheriff?
-I'm afraid I can't let you in the town.

01:18:42.258 --> 01:18:43.717
And why is that?

01:18:43.842 --> 01:18:47.717
Anyone siding with the Indians 
ain't welcome here.

01:18:48.633 --> 01:18:50.482
That's where you got 
things wrong, Sheriff.

01:18:50.582 --> 01:18:53.688
I ain't on the side of the Indians, 
I'm on the side of right.

01:19:06.008 --> 01:19:09.175
You know this is 
where they shot Gunga Din?

01:19:09.342 --> 01:19:12.967
Who's Gunga Din, 
and why did they shoot him?

01:19:13.175 --> 01:19:14.217
Never mind.

01:19:15.467 --> 01:19:17.258
How do you wanna do this, boss?

01:19:18.175 --> 01:19:19.675
Publicly.

01:19:22.217 --> 01:19:24.133
It's your move, Sheriff.

01:19:38.867 --> 01:19:40.560
Go get Duke and meet me at the drive-in.

01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:42.221
Drive-in?
-Yeah, trust me.

01:19:45.092 --> 01:19:46.709
We don't want Indians in here.

01:19:46.809 --> 01:19:49.617
You better be reaching 
for that holster on your hip.

01:20:00.133 --> 01:20:01.842
Cut! Cut!

01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:06.217
Who the hell are these guys?
-Who cares? At least it's some color.

01:20:06.383 --> 01:20:07.883
Rhubarb!

01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:09.800
Rhubarb! Rhubarb!

01:20:11.967 --> 01:20:13.133
Shit!

01:20:16.217 --> 01:20:17.258
Motherfucker!

01:20:17.425 --> 01:20:20.467
Duke, we gotta get out of here!
We gotta go. We gotta get out of here.

01:20:20.633 --> 01:20:22.300
Get the car! Get the car!

01:20:26.967 --> 01:20:28.592
Hurry up!

01:20:39.092 --> 01:20:43.883
Butterscotch, no! Come back!

01:22:19.717 --> 01:22:22.258
Sorry, Mr. Montana...

01:22:22.717 --> 01:22:25.258
but I'm gonna have to kill you.
-Kill me?

01:22:25.331 --> 01:22:27.506
Under different circumstances
I might be telling you

01:22:27.606 --> 01:22:29.170
how much I appreciated your work

01:22:29.175 --> 01:22:31.383
in "Silver Spurs",
"I'll Save Three For Papa".

01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:34.633
You liked that fucking movie?
-Yeah. A lot.

01:22:35.425 --> 01:22:37.383
But... Well I...

01:22:38.508 --> 01:22:40.550
I gotta kill you.

01:22:46.217 --> 01:22:49.508
Reggie, don't do something 
you gonna regret, please.

01:22:49.675 --> 01:22:51.592
Reggie? Do you know these guys?

01:22:51.758 --> 01:22:54.300
I'm not gonna regret any part of this.

01:22:54.467 --> 01:22:58.342
As a matter of fact, 
I gotta kill you first, Max.

01:23:02.092 --> 01:23:04.028
Great job, Duke. Now what?

01:23:04.365 --> 01:23:07.648
Now what? How about telling me 
what the hell is going on here?

01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:16.133
Duke...

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:29.258
Holy fucking shit...

01:24:31.142 --> 01:24:32.727
Yes!
-Yes!

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:39.342
Maxy, goddamn 
I think you did it, partner.

01:24:39.508 --> 01:24:41.342
That's our movie?
-Yeah, that's it.

01:24:42.190 --> 01:24:44.463
I would say 
this is some of your best work, Max.

01:24:44.467 --> 01:24:47.258
But that wouldn't be saying 
a whole lot, would it?

01:24:47.425 --> 01:24:49.620
But let me be the first one 
to say it to you...

01:24:49.876 --> 01:24:51.126
Oscar!

01:24:53.175 --> 01:24:55.800
How much more do you gotta shoot?
-One day.

01:24:55.967 --> 01:24:57.883
I'll see you in LA.

01:24:58.092 --> 01:24:59.517
Mr. Mon...

01:24:59.806 --> 01:25:01.812
Duke? Duke?

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.800
Thank you.

01:25:06.342 --> 01:25:08.508
Put the guns away.
We're not killing anybody!

01:25:08.675 --> 01:25:10.997
Can I at least throw a bullet
at the motherfucker?

01:25:11.925 --> 01:25:14.800
Like I said would you mind telling me 
what's going on here?

01:25:14.925 --> 01:25:19.718
Well, Duke, I just... 
I don't want you to be upset with...

01:25:19.978 --> 01:25:21.484
With what I'm gonna tell you.

01:25:21.508 --> 01:25:24.464
Oh, heck, Mr. Barber, 
you can tell me anything.

01:25:25.345 --> 01:25:26.618
We're friends.

01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:34.675
Duke, you can't!
-Why the hell not? You were trying too.

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:36.008
What the hell are you doing?

01:25:36.217 --> 01:25:38.425
Max is sorry 
he was trying to kill you, Duke.

01:25:38.592 --> 01:25:41.175
Which Walter inspired me to do.
-No, I did not!

01:25:41.342 --> 01:25:43.133
Oh, yes, you did. 
Oh, Yes, you did.

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:45.883
I did not... the point is,
Duke, we all want you alive.

01:25:46.258 --> 01:25:48.800
Goddammit this is not about me
living or dying.

01:25:48.925 --> 01:25:50.633
It's not?
-No.

01:25:51.425 --> 01:25:54.383
Duke, you're not making any sense.

01:25:55.883 --> 01:26:00.717
I have been trying to destroy myself.

01:26:00.842 --> 01:26:03.217
because I broke her heart.

01:26:03.383 --> 01:26:07.758
The love of my life.
I can't let her go.

01:26:07.883 --> 01:26:10.800
Who, Duke?
-Bessy.

01:26:12.425 --> 01:26:13.925
Bessy Jones.

01:26:14.842 --> 01:26:18.550
When I was in New Orleans
I wound up in black club.

01:26:18.717 --> 01:26:21.883
Booze, and Willie Proudfoot playing.

01:26:22.092 --> 01:26:25.758
Then she looked at me 
with those big beautiful eyes and...

01:26:26.425 --> 01:26:28.800
she sang.

01:26:31.342 --> 01:26:34.219
And I knew right then 
that she was the one for me.

01:26:34.434 --> 01:26:35.652
And me for her.

01:26:36.675 --> 01:26:40.425
I'm about to sign a million dollar contract 
and studio old boss says:

01:26:40.592 --> 01:26:44.633
Duke, you gotta make up your mind:
you wanna be a rich western movie star

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:50.800
or do you wanna run off 
with your black girlfriend?

01:26:50.967 --> 01:26:52.342
So you chose stardom?

01:26:52.508 --> 01:26:54.800
Who the goddamn hell 
is telling this fucking story?

01:26:54.925 --> 01:26:57.633
A happy, well adjusted man 
with a sole mate at his side

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:01.114
or an angry, broke down, emptied up

01:27:01.892 --> 01:27:04.172
suicidal drunk?

01:27:05.883 --> 01:27:08.675
Why don't you guys get out of here 
so I can kill myself?

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:09.976
No! No!

01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:11.362
Duke! No, no!

01:27:12.175 --> 01:27:13.592
Duke!

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.133
Listen to me, you son of a bitch!

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:20.105
I'm sick and tired of this shit.

01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:22.737
I don't give a shit about you 
or your sad story.

01:27:22.758 --> 01:27:25.800
Or your fucking colored Louisiana 
blues singer girlfriend!

01:27:25.967 --> 01:27:28.851
I bled to my ass for this fucking moment.

01:27:28.896 --> 01:27:31.122
And I am one sit away 
from my fucking Oscar.

01:27:31.222 --> 01:27:34.536
You gonna stop with the booze, 
stop with the gun and stop with the bullshit!

01:27:34.675 --> 01:27:38.424
You gonna get a good night sleep.
You gonna have wonderful, beautiful dreams

01:27:38.524 --> 01:27:41.900
of prairies and mountain streams 
with the dear and antelope playing.

01:27:41.956 --> 01:27:44.258
And in the morning 
you gonna wake up refreshed

01:27:44.425 --> 01:27:47.258
Drink a pot of fucking coffee, 
you gonna do the goddamn scene.

01:27:47.425 --> 01:27:49.619
And you gonna do it brilliantly.

01:27:49.823 --> 01:27:52.292
And after that
when our director yells 'cut'

01:27:52.383 --> 01:27:56.092
you can stick up bazooka up your ass 
and pull the fucking trigger for all I care.

01:27:56.467 --> 01:28:01.717
But you will be on that set 
tomorrow morning at 7 AM,

01:28:01.842 --> 01:28:04.842
and you will finish this movie!

01:28:11.758 --> 01:28:16.342
That's the most honest thing
anybody's said this entire shooting.

01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:30.800
<i>Life is really 
just one big mistake, isn't it?</i>

01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:35.592
<i>I mean so precious</i>

01:28:36.633 --> 01:28:40.508
<i>and we're treating it 
like it was meaningless.</i>

01:28:41.508 --> 01:28:47.633
I was playing poker one time 
with this old Chinese fella named Chen Liu.

01:28:48.425 --> 01:28:53.758
Long, black flowing hair, 
boniest of hands, far too many teeth.

01:28:53.883 --> 01:28:58.383
And he was laughing, and drinking 
and having a good ol' time

01:28:58.550 --> 01:29:01.996
and I swear he had the biggest pot 
of poker chips in front of him

01:29:02.096 --> 01:29:03.687
I had ever seen.

01:29:04.092 --> 01:29:05.800
Thousands of dollars.

01:29:05.967 --> 01:29:07.882
Thousands upon thousands. Hell...

01:29:08.098 --> 01:29:10.917
He had so many poker chips 
he was giving them away.

01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:18.925
And then his pile of poker chips dwindled.

01:29:19.675 --> 01:29:22.342
And it dwindled some more.

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:27.925
And the evening went on,
Old Chen sobered up,

01:29:28.217 --> 01:29:31.800
realized what he had done.

01:29:34.675 --> 01:29:38.661
I wish I had been a little bit 
more respectful of a pile of poker chips

01:29:38.695 --> 01:29:41.464
that God put in front of me
to get started on.

01:29:44.342 --> 01:29:47.800
But hell, that's life.

01:29:49.675 --> 01:29:52.717
Mistakes and lost poker chips.

01:29:54.342 --> 01:29:59.633
One great day, beautiful...

01:30:01.133 --> 01:30:03.258
mistake.

01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:15.383
And cut!

01:30:20.342 --> 01:30:22.092
That's a wrap!

01:30:26.425 --> 01:30:28.008
You did it!

01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:46.408
DUKE MONTANA
THE OLDEST GUN IN THE WEST

01:30:49.675 --> 01:30:53.550
This is Sophie Renee. It's a beautiful 
summer evening in Los Angeles.

01:30:53.717 --> 01:30:57.175
And we're all here for the world premiere 
of "The Oldest Gun In The West".

01:30:57.342 --> 01:30:59.331
We're waiting for the stars to arrive.

01:30:59.541 --> 01:31:02.519
We have some producers, 
we have some of the actors.

01:31:03.092 --> 01:31:05.717
And this is a big return of Duke Montana.

01:31:05.842 --> 01:31:09.550
One of the greatest Hollywood icons 
ever to grace the silver screen.

01:31:09.717 --> 01:31:11.800
Excuse me, gentlemen? Hello.

01:31:11.925 --> 01:31:14.175
Max Barber, Walter Creason.

01:31:14.342 --> 01:31:16.342
You two and the producers of
"The Oldest Gun In The West"

01:31:16.508 --> 01:31:19.217
which many are saying is gonna be the one 
to beat on Oscar night.

01:31:19.317 --> 01:31:20.240
How are you feeling?

01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:22.425
We are very honored 
and humbled to be here.

01:31:22.532 --> 01:31:24.888
And this is what happens 
when a lot of talented individuals

01:31:24.988 --> 01:31:27.788
all come together 
with a singular vision and purpose.

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:29.550
It's quite special.

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:31.717
I want to say that my uncle and I 
believe in miracles.

01:31:31.842 --> 01:31:33.675
That's for sure.
-That's lovely.

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:37.842
Excuse me, Megan Albert, I heard 
your work is amazing in the picture.

01:31:38.008 --> 01:31:40.588
You are one of the very few 
female directors in the Hollywood.

01:31:40.611 --> 01:31:41.789
How does that feel?

01:31:41.883 --> 01:31:45.925
I really hope that I can inspire 
more women to become directors.

01:31:46.133 --> 01:31:48.206
I really have Max Barber, Walter Creason,

01:31:48.306 --> 01:31:51.320
and most of all Duke Montana
to thank for believing in me.

01:31:51.633 --> 01:31:54.633
She's cool, huh? We met at work together.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:56.004
What's next for you all?

01:31:56.046 --> 01:31:58.945
Actually, now that I'm the president 
of the studio

01:31:59.175 --> 01:32:02.633
I've signed Max, Walter and Megan
to a multi-picture deal.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:07.300
In fact my first project out of the gate
is gonna be the epic "Paradise".

01:32:07.467 --> 01:32:14.093
And I will be co-financing 
all future Miracle Motion Picture pictures.

01:32:14.128 --> 01:32:15.298
Right, you heard me.

01:32:15.425 --> 01:32:19.583
Just like Humphrey Bogart muscled up 
Jimmy Cagney in "The Roaring Twenties".

01:32:19.683 --> 01:32:20.521
You remember that?

01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:23.592
That's right, yeah.
-Remember?

01:32:24.467 --> 01:32:27.467
Like the brother just said:
We in the business!

01:32:27.633 --> 01:32:32.168
And we're gonna be doing black movies soon 
with black actors. Right on!

01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:34.493
Okay, so...

01:32:34.593 --> 01:32:37.244
Max and James, rumor has it 
that over the years

01:32:37.344 --> 01:32:39.651
you two have had 
very contentious relationship.

01:32:39.751 --> 01:32:40.962
You care to comment?

01:32:41.119 --> 01:32:43.196
Jimmy and I have talked this over 
and we both agree

01:32:43.296 --> 01:32:46.370
that there's nothing as tenuous
as enemies in show business.

01:32:46.633 --> 01:32:49.215
Yeah, you can't believe 
everything you hear. Max Barber

01:32:49.515 --> 01:32:53.649
is a great great grandfather figure 
for me. Always has been.

01:32:54.925 --> 01:32:58.633
Okay, gentlemen, thank you for stopping 
and I wish you all the best tonight.

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:00.717
Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

01:33:00.842 --> 01:33:04.126
What the fuck is the "grandfather" thing?
I told you not to call me Jimmy.

01:33:04.175 --> 01:33:06.298
Don't call "Paradise" your movie. 
Cause it's not.

01:33:06.398 --> 01:33:08.354
Can we at least agree that it is ours?

01:33:08.425 --> 01:33:11.675
No, it's not ours. I haven't signed--
-Max, come on. Max...

01:33:12.493 --> 01:33:16.425
Come on, it's our movie.
-Yeah, all right, that.

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:29.675
Duke Montana, how does it feel
to be back on top?

01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:31.022
I don't know.

01:33:31.943 --> 01:33:35.341
I guess it's very nice if you all 
came out to see an old cowboy.

01:33:36.085 --> 01:33:38.800
Congratulations, and we wish you 
the best of luck tonight.

01:33:38.967 --> 01:33:41.800
Duke? Come on, 
you gonna miss your big comeback.

01:33:41.925 --> 01:33:43.717
I'll be right with you, partner.

01:33:43.991 --> 01:33:45.035
Hey, Duke.

01:33:46.518 --> 01:33:49.146
Come on, Duke, this is more your night 
than anybody's.

01:33:50.467 --> 01:33:53.800
I don't do very well 
in crowds, Mr. Barber.

01:33:54.675 --> 01:33:57.383
I think I do better 
in the wide open spaces.

01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:59.550
But we need you. Come on.

01:33:59.717 --> 01:34:01.842
Mr. Barber.

01:34:02.092 --> 01:34:04.175
I can’t do it.

01:34:13.967 --> 01:34:16.467
Thank you for trying to kill me.

01:34:16.633 --> 01:34:19.092
Thanks for not dying.

01:34:19.836 --> 01:34:20.950
Okay.

01:34:21.558 --> 01:34:22.717
What's he doing?

01:34:24.072 --> 01:34:25.137
Stay!

01:34:31.278 --> 01:34:32.198
You're the man, Duke.

01:34:32.398 --> 01:34:33.674
You're the best, Duke.

01:34:33.793 --> 01:34:36.364
We're gonna watch your movie, Duke.

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:38.767
Thank you, Duke.

01:34:41.758 --> 01:34:44.175
Hope you'll find 
what you're looking for.

01:35:22.425 --> 01:35:24.258
Is Bess home?

01:35:24.557 --> 01:35:25.931
There's an after credit scene.
