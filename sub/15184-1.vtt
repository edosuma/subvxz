01:45.620 --> 01:48.476
Be careful.

01:48.839 --> 01:51.355
Tommy!

01:53.740 --> 01:56.896
Don't do that.

02:01.499 --> 02:04.235
Look, there's daddy.

02:04.380 --> 02:06.177
Where?

02:06.259 --> 02:09.395
I see him!

02:24.820 --> 02:26.870
Where, daddy?

02:26.979 --> 02:29.413
This thing is getting heavy.

02:29.499 --> 02:31.455
My office, right there.

02:31.540 --> 02:34.196
There.

02:38.260 --> 02:40.728
I can watch you from here
when you work.

02:40.820 --> 02:45.898
Yeah, but most of the time
I'll be way out there.

03:11.419 --> 03:15.314
Daddy when do we get there?
- She said it again mom.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.818
What?

03:17.900 --> 03:22.371
I told you, if you said that one more
time, I was gonna strangle you.

03:22.460 --> 03:26.179
I spy with my little eye.

03:29.299 --> 03:31.955
Hallelujah!

03:32.100 --> 03:36.395
Are all these guys
working for you, daddy?

03:41.900 --> 03:46.216
How's it going?
- Its going pretty well.

03:46.299 --> 03:50.258
By the way, I would like you to
take a look at some plan-drawings

03:50.339 --> 03:54.378
This is my wife Jean.
- Hi, how are you?

03:56.140 --> 03:58.996
Tommy!

04:00.939 --> 04:04.932
We have to clear ten square kilometres
and level the ground right now

04:05.020 --> 04:10.079
It will be some time before your
husband can start pouring concrete

04:12.139 --> 04:17.214
The roots of the trees aren't very deep
so the bulldozer just push them down.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.870
I'm scared.
-I'm not.

04:24.140 --> 04:27.610
When you get a little bigger, I'll
show you how to drive one of those.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.836
Great!

04:39.300 --> 04:42.609
Come on,
let's get something to eat.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.369
Where is everything
going to be?

05:28.460 --> 05:33.612
Well, there's a lot more work to be
done. We got to clear all these trees.

05:34.659 --> 05:39.557
All this, down to the river. Before we
even can start construction of the dam.

05:42.699 --> 05:46.791
Over here, we'll put the
town and the airstrip.

05:48.019 --> 05:51.572
It's really gonna be
something, isn't it?

05:52.500 --> 05:55.491
Mommy is Tommy allowed?

05:57.660 --> 06:00.349
It's okay daddy, isn't it?

06:00.700 --> 06:02.656
Is it safe?

06:02.740 --> 06:06.549
You just stay where
I can see you, okay?

06:10.619 --> 06:13.938
Are there any snakes here daddy?

06:17.460 --> 06:20.316
No.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.252
Daddy!

07:01.660 --> 07:06.248
There is people in there.
- People, what kind of people?

07:06.340 --> 07:08.619
Smiling people.

07:08.859 --> 07:12.254
He just wants you
to play with him.

07:13.179 --> 07:15.935
Okay big boy,
let's go and have a look.

07:16.179 --> 07:19.247
All right, come on.
- There, I'll show you!

07:20.260 --> 07:22.616
Where are they?

07:22.779 --> 07:25.735
Smiling people, huh?

07:26.499 --> 07:29.555
Come on!

07:36.459 --> 07:38.415
I don't see anybody.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.856
They were here.

07:46.420 --> 07:49.676
Come on, let's go.

07:55.220 --> 08:00.338
Tell you what I like to do? Let's go
down to the river and have a swim.

08:02.179 --> 08:05.293
Quit fooling around, let's go!

08:10.980 --> 08:14.256
Tommy!
Get yourself down here.

08:14.339 --> 08:18.416
Come on, Tommy,
I'm not playing around now.

08:22.219 --> 08:26.272
I'm gonna bust your behind
when I get you, son.

08:40.099 --> 08:42.455
Jean!

08:44.259 --> 08:47.695
Get some help!
They've taken Tommy!

08:47.779 --> 08:52.136
They've taken Tommy!
Just get some help!

08:52.219 --> 08:55.075
Help!

08:55.780 --> 08:59.236
Somebody help me please!

09:14.656 --> 09:17.495
Come here baby.

09:17.779 --> 09:20.635
It's okay.

09:42.460 --> 09:45.516
Baby answer me.

09:45.939 --> 09:48.797
Bill!

11:33.660 --> 11:37.775
It's a big problem here, yes,
These abandoned children.

11:42.819 --> 11:47.107
More than two millons
roaming the streets etc, etc.

11:47.619 --> 11:50.338
I will cover it, but it's been done
so many times.

11:50.419 --> 11:53.650
Jean searched all these
places for Tommy.

11:53.739 --> 11:57.709
When she saw what's going on,
she kind of, got involved.

11:58.780 --> 12:01.533
I see, she looks after lost children,

12:01.620 --> 12:06.654
and maybe someone, somewhere
looks after her lost boy.

12:12.019 --> 12:15.216
So we gradually built up this map
of Amazonian tribes...

12:15.299 --> 12:21.259
their hunting grounds, numbers,
cosmologies and so on.

12:21.980 --> 12:26.212
Your editor was so helpful early on,
by publishing our problem.

12:26.300 --> 12:29.212
a lot of people
came forward with information.

12:29.300 --> 12:32.394
Yeah, he is very sentimental.

12:32.980 --> 12:36.574
He likes, human stories.

12:36.820 --> 12:38.856
It makes him feel noble.

12:38.939 --> 12:41.533
This area that...

12:41.619 --> 12:45.208
you and Bill are
going to be going to...

12:45.540 --> 12:49.337
We know for a fact
there are at least...

12:50.180 --> 12:54.978
two tribes, that have had no
contact with the outside world.

12:55.219 --> 12:58.529
Are you taking fireworks this time?
- Sure.

12:58.619 --> 13:01.614
Somewhere in this region here.

13:02.179 --> 13:05.212
And you think,

13:05.899 --> 13:08.855
the poor little boy...

13:09.060 --> 13:12.530
No, it's not knowing
that is so hard, you know.

13:12.620 --> 13:17.535
There are times when I...
- You almost wish he were dead?

13:17.819 --> 13:22.290
So you can stop all the searching,
and at least get some peace of mind.

13:22.379 --> 13:27.134
I can understand that.
- You don't understand, at all.

13:33.699 --> 13:37.138
Can you smell it?
The oxygen.

13:37.499 --> 13:42.015
40 percent of the worlds oxygen
is produced here, in the Amazon.

13:42.100 --> 13:45.251
Come on, Uwe,
you know oxygen doesn't smell,

13:45.340 --> 13:49.376
it's the rot, the decay.

13:50.379 --> 13:54.235
Also the blossoms.

14:26.939 --> 14:29.995
Look!

14:39.499 --> 14:44.548
You would miss these trips
if you found your boy, huh?

14:46.819 --> 14:52.197
Listen Uwe, I'm letting you tag along
because I owe your magazine a favor.

14:55.579 --> 14:58.616
But I am running out
of gratitude real fast.

14:58.699 --> 15:02.491
No hombre, please,
just making fun.

15:30.580 --> 15:32.377
Father Leduc.
- Hello.

15:32.459 --> 15:35.932
Good to see you.
This is Uwe Werner.

15:36.380 --> 15:41.216
Confirmed atheist, I'm afraid.
- Ahh, they confirm atheists now.

15:41.299 --> 15:44.697
It's hard to keep up
with new ideas out here.

15:45.340 --> 15:48.117
Here you go.

15:49.419 --> 15:51.853
You got my message?
- I did indeed.

15:51.939 --> 15:55.009
Would this craft be suitable?

15:55.579 --> 15:59.135
Just the ticket.

15:59.940 --> 16:04.838
You talk with the indians
before you go?

16:29.700 --> 16:32.817
He is saying something about,
being not seen.

16:32.900 --> 16:36.931
Yes, they say it's an arrow of...

16:37.460 --> 16:41.416
The Invisible People

16:51.780 --> 16:55.995
Did he say,
they hunt on this side of the river?

16:56.179 --> 16:58.818
Yes.

16:58.899 --> 17:01.572
You ever had contact
with this tribe?

17:01.660 --> 17:03.491
Nobody has.

17:03.579 --> 17:08.676
Even these people here, have only
heard about them from others.

18:43.620 --> 18:45.611
Killed him! One dart.

19:09.779 --> 19:10.973
No.

19:11.060 --> 19:13.210
He's old and slow like me.

19:28.820 --> 19:33.857
Beware, it's a very hungryjaguar
that hunts fish.

20:00.139 --> 20:04.253
Allow for the water bending the arrow.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.091
One more day and we are home.

20:43.820 --> 20:47.857
When you hear the toucan,
danger is near.

20:58.539 --> 21:01.595
The Fierce People.

22:07.020 --> 22:08.692
I killed a monkey.

22:08.779 --> 22:10.531
By yourself?

22:10.619 --> 22:13.133
My father let me.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.093
We saw The Fierce People.

22:21.540 --> 22:26.295
A war party of The Fierce People
is very close.

22:28.540 --> 22:31.590
We must be prepared.

22:37.899 --> 22:39.855
I will watch.

22:43.739 --> 22:46.651
Mother, it is for you.

22:47.779 --> 22:49.735
Honey.

23:00.620 --> 23:04.249
My new son!

23:47.299 --> 23:50.335
Girls from Paranita.

23:55.580 --> 23:57.457
Who's she?

23:57.540 --> 23:59.656
That's Kachiri.

23:59.740 --> 24:02.049
Little Kachiri?

24:02.139 --> 24:04.095
You like her?

24:27.019 --> 24:29.374
You will scare the fish.

24:29.459 --> 24:32.019
You won't spear a fish.

24:32.100 --> 24:34.170
But a fish is going to spear you.

24:48.299 --> 24:51.052
Tomme, you think you are a man

24:51.139 --> 24:54.290
but I only see a stupid boy.

24:57.420 --> 25:00.014
Your time has come to die.

25:02.860 --> 25:05.055
Must he die?

25:05.139 --> 25:07.130
Yes.

25:07.219 --> 25:11.417
I will never see my boy again.

26:50.699 --> 26:52.735
The boy is dead...

26:56.099 --> 26:58.408
and the man is born.

31:39.020 --> 31:41.136
I saw green stones in a waterfall.

31:41.220 --> 31:43.450
You have seen the Sacred Stones.

31:43.540 --> 31:49.410
It was the place we lived in
before The Fierce People came.

31:49.500 --> 31:57.930
From these stones comes the paint
that makes us The Invisible People.

31:58.019 --> 31:59.975
Just these are left.

32:00.780 --> 32:04.056
I will go to that place and find more stones.

32:36.980 --> 32:39.210
I need you and you need me.

32:40.420 --> 32:43.776
Now you are a man
you say what other men say to me.

32:43.859 --> 32:45.770
I will find the Sacred Stones

32:45.860 --> 32:47.896
which is more than other men can do.

32:47.980 --> 32:50.335
The Fierce People will catch you.

32:50.419 --> 32:52.455
I will be invisible.

32:57.700 --> 33:00.134
They will cook you and eat you...

33:00.220 --> 33:03.417
even the grandfathers without teeth.

33:04.420 --> 33:07.650
I am invisible.

34:07.059 --> 34:10.929
Astonishing!

34:35.380 --> 34:37.496
This is what you came for, isn't it?

34:37.580 --> 34:40.949
You think they are a lost tribe?

34:41.139 --> 34:46.156
If anybody is lost, it is us.

36:06.179 --> 36:09.091
What did he say?
- The arrow is from The Invisible People

36:09.180 --> 36:11.679
who are good meat.

36:11.779 --> 36:15.312
Maybe you and I are even sweeter.

37:31.420 --> 37:34.571
What is going on?
What did he say?

37:34.659 --> 37:40.796
He says, that I have the heart
of a hungry jaguar, like him.

37:49.420 --> 37:54.210
He is giving me a chance.
I go now...

37:54.229 --> 37:57.754
at dawn they'll hunt me.

37:58.059 --> 38:00.951
What about me?

46:28.499 --> 46:30.455
My name is Tomme.

46:41.260 --> 46:43.057
We go to my father.

46:43.140 --> 46:45.051
He will help you.

46:45.139 --> 46:47.209
I am your father.

46:48.219 --> 46:50.687
No, you are Daddee.

46:50.780 --> 46:54.250
You live in there, when I dream.

46:54.339 --> 46:56.295
Now you are here.

46:58.139 --> 47:00.095
Come.

47:17.420 --> 47:19.615
Listen.

47:19.699 --> 47:21.894
The frogs.

47:21.980 --> 47:24.210
A big rain comes.

47:30.019 --> 47:34.934
Your mother, Jean.
Can you remember her?

48:20.020 --> 48:21.976
The Stones.

48:25.859 --> 48:27.895
The Sacred Stones.

48:35.820 --> 48:37.811
I killed five Fierce warriors.

48:37.900 --> 48:39.379
Five!

48:39.460 --> 48:42.930
He is Daddee. I told you about him...

48:43.020 --> 48:45.534
the one in my dreams.

48:47.180 --> 48:49.978
Hey, Daddee. Yes, we know you.

49:07.539 --> 49:10.736
When a dream becomes flesh

49:10.820 --> 49:13.015
trouble is not far behind.

49:24.579 --> 49:26.535
He has a fever.

49:32.699 --> 49:34.974
He is near death.

49:32.699 --> 49:35.975
Father, surely you can cure him.

49:39.819 --> 49:42.617
Even a great storm

49:42.700 --> 49:45.851
cannot always quench a forest fire.

49:46.699 --> 49:48.929
Wanadi, do it.

49:50.419 --> 49:53.331
If it can be done

49:50.419 --> 49:52.375
I will do it.

49:59.619 --> 50:02.179
Daddee, can you hear me?

50:07.820 --> 50:09.856
He will hear you.

50:13.059 --> 50:18.816
I will suck out the evil fire.

50:50.939 --> 50:56.969
The evil fire is gone.

50:58.179 --> 51:00.215
You see,

51:00.300 --> 51:02.256
he is a great healer.

51:06.579 --> 51:08.774
Now, he must sleep.

51:21.420 --> 51:23.729
I will show you a great secret.

51:28.500 --> 51:30.456
Watch the fire.

52:00.739 --> 52:02.730
Why did you take my son?

52:02.819 --> 52:07.529
One day, I was hunting
at the Edge of The World

52:07.619 --> 52:10.497
when Tomme appeared

52:11.580 --> 52:13.696
and he smiled

52:14.819 --> 52:17.970
and even though
you were a Termite Child,

52:19.939 --> 52:23.056
I had not the heart

52:24.659 --> 52:28.254
to send you back to The Dead World.

52:31.539 --> 52:34.133
Why are they called The Termite People?

52:34.979 --> 52:37.015
They come into The World

52:37.099 --> 52:40.136
and chew down all the grandfather trees.

52:40.220 --> 52:43.371
Just like termites.

53:55.500 --> 53:58.572
I want your daughter

53:58.660 --> 54:01.333
but I give you the Sacred Stones.

54:13.859 --> 54:17.977
Kachiri, you will tend the fire.
- No! I tend to my father's fire.

54:20.860 --> 54:22.816
Do it right.

57:04.539 --> 57:06.495
You like it?

57:07.500 --> 57:09.491
I made it for you.

57:22.259 --> 57:25.217
Tomme needs Kachiri

57:25.299 --> 57:27.608
and Kachiri needs Tomme.

57:29.100 --> 57:31.136
You need me?

57:40.219 --> 57:42.687
You are well?

57:42.780 --> 57:45.010
She is yours if you have need.

57:46.099 --> 57:48.659
Need?
Yes.

57:57.299 --> 57:59.017
Eat and be strong,

57:59.100 --> 58:01.091
then you will have need.

58:02.819 --> 58:05.287
Shall we got to the river and bathe?

58:36.500 --> 58:38.968
We have crushed the Sacred Stones.

58:40.140 --> 58:43.132
And once again they

58:43.220 --> 58:45.495
shine in our war paint.

58:45.580 --> 58:47.536
You are well.

58:51.340 --> 58:53.729
I want you to come with me.

58:54.900 --> 58:56.652
Momma wants you to come home.

58:56.739 --> 59:01.369
He is finished with mothers.
I am his woman now.

59:03.820 --> 59:05.776
You stole my son.

59:07.900 --> 59:10.573
He took you from me, from Momma.

59:15.219 --> 59:17.528
That was long ago.

59:21.020 --> 59:24.410
I just want you to see the home
that you came from.

59:25.180 --> 59:27.136
This is my home.

59:28.940 --> 59:31.170
It will be the home of my children.

59:37.779 --> 59:40.418
Daddee, you must rest here

59:40.499 --> 59:43.138
and we must hunt.

59:43.220 --> 59:47.259
For tonight is the feast
of Tomme and Kachiri.

59:49.100 --> 59:51.250
Stop.

59:51.340 --> 59:53.012
You are the chief.

59:53.100 --> 59:55.056
Tell him to come and visit.

59:55.140 --> 59:56.937
He can choose.

59:57.020 --> 59:58.931
If I tell a man

59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.170
to do what he does not want to do

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:03.216
I am no longer chief.

01:00:45.619 --> 01:00:47.814
Why are you so sad?

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.050
Ten years, Tomme,

01:01:02.179 --> 01:01:04.295
looking for you,

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:07.730
all over.

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:12.778
Yes. It is good to hunt,

01:01:13.859 --> 01:01:15.815
to track an animal.

01:01:17.459 --> 01:01:20.735
You should be happy.

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:24.134
But no, you feel sad.

01:01:30.259 --> 01:01:32.329
It will be a good feast tonight.

01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:55.171
I must return.

01:03:57.939 --> 01:04:00.737
Why go back to that terrible place?

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.777
You can stay

01:04:03.859 --> 01:04:06.419
and become a great warrior and hunter.

01:04:09.219 --> 01:04:11.335
My family is there.

01:04:12.859 --> 01:04:14.815
It is where I belong.

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:23.456
Bring the pipe.

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.530
I swore to Tomme's mother

01:04:31.419 --> 01:04:33.375
I would bring him back.

01:04:36.979 --> 01:04:38.935
Your heart is torn.

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:43.498
If you take him, you'll wish you had not.

01:04:46.179 --> 01:04:49.888
If you don't take him, you will wish you had.

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:15.897
You are a man of courage.

01:05:16.459 --> 01:05:18.415
You have travelled far

01:05:18.499 --> 01:05:21.457
and you have come
to the centre of The World.

01:05:23.619 --> 01:05:26.008
Now you can go farther and see more.

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:30.976
But you cannot enter that place naked.

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:36.412
It is our way.

01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:05.248
Accept out gift, Daddee.

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:12.173
You will meet your spirit animal
and he will show you.

01:08:02.659 --> 01:08:04.490
When I was a boy,

01:08:04.579 --> 01:08:07.855
the Edge of The World was very far,

01:08:07.939 --> 01:08:10.851
but every year it comes closer.

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:29.220
The Fierce Ones came before dawn.

01:09:42.139 --> 01:09:44.095
Mother!

01:09:53.618 --> 01:09:56.087
There was a terrible noise.

01:09:58.379 --> 01:10:00.768
They had spears that made lightning.

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:07.172
Did you see Kachiri?

01:10:07.259 --> 01:10:09.215
I ran away.

01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:14.775
Father, they have killed Uluru.

01:10:16.059 --> 01:10:17.811
I cannot find Kachiri.

01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:25.531
The fire will set free their souls to the stars.

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:50.131
And what is left of the dead
must be crushed.

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:54.136
Crushed into dust.

01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:00.688
In here is the dust
of those who went before us,

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:04.412
even the First Man and First Woman.

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:51.292
Now drink in the memory
of what we have been

01:12:52.419 --> 01:12:55.695
and the lives of those who went before us

01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:58.891
will live inside us.

01:13:12.299 --> 01:13:14.767
Drink, boy. You come too.

01:14:24.899 --> 01:14:28.175
They are taking the skin off The World.

01:14:28.259 --> 01:14:29.977
How will she breathe?

01:14:30.059 --> 01:14:32.334
There was a great river there once.

01:14:33.819 --> 01:14:36.049
What is that?

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.897
It's like...a log jam.

01:14:40.979 --> 01:14:43.777
This was the home of The Fierce People.

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:47.569
Now we know why
they came to our part of The World.

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:53.051
Father, there!

01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.698
Come back.

01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:02.533
We are not invisible in The Dead World.

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:03.735
But, Father!

01:15:03.819 --> 01:15:06.413
No. We go along The Edge of The World.

01:16:47.659 --> 01:16:50.810
Look. Strange trees and vines.

01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:53.899
We can climb up.

01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:56.130
Go across the vine and down.

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:04.500
If we attack now we will all die.

01:19:04.579 --> 01:19:07.810
But without our women
we will be a people no more.

01:19:56.779 --> 01:19:58.735
Father.

01:20:28.739 --> 01:20:31.572
Put me down. I must die.

01:20:39.659 --> 01:20:44.096
Brother, set my soul free with fire.

01:20:44.939 --> 01:20:47.089
Add a few grains of my bones

01:20:47.699 --> 01:20:50.771
to the dust of those that went before us.

01:20:53.699 --> 01:20:55.655
Son,

01:20:56.859 --> 01:20:59.771
do what I could not do.

01:20:59.859 --> 01:21:01.815
I will, Father.

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:16.891
Do as my father says.

01:21:16.979 --> 01:21:19.254
Take his body back

01:21:19.339 --> 01:21:21.534
and wait for me there.

01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:26.094
What? Where will you go?

01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:30.854
I will go beyond The Edge of The World.

01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:33.090
To find my other father.

01:21:33.179 --> 01:21:36.216
He knows about the Lightning Spears.

01:21:36.299 --> 01:21:38.255
I will ask him to help us.

01:21:52.339 --> 01:21:54.295
How do you know this is the way?

01:21:54.379 --> 01:21:58.292
He told me he lives at the end
of The River-Without-Water.

01:22:39.739 --> 01:22:42.537
The River-Without-Water ends here.

01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:44.576
Daddee lives here?

01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:47.931
He said his village

01:22:48.019 --> 01:22:50.408
has more people than ants in an ant hill.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.256
Could that be it?

01:24:47.459 --> 01:24:49.814
I know you.

01:24:49.899 --> 01:24:52.652
You are The Invisible People.

01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:57.130
Come. Hurry.

01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:06.649
So there are still people like you.

01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:34.936
You called us The Bat People.

01:25:35.019 --> 01:25:36.611
Because you hunted at night.

01:25:36.699 --> 01:25:40.612
My father told me
many stories about your tribe.

01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:42.372
Why do you come here?

01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:45.338
We seek what you call A White Man.

01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:47.331
Can you help us?

01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:48.739
What's he called?

01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:51.334
Bil. He said he was called Bil.

01:25:53.539 --> 01:25:55.370
Señor Bil?

01:25:55.459 --> 01:25:57.097
It's not enough.

01:25:57.179 --> 01:26:01.138
The people here have many names.
You must know them all,

01:26:01.219 --> 01:26:03.892
and each living place has a number.

01:26:03.979 --> 01:26:06.732
Did he tell you any numbers?

01:26:06.819 --> 01:26:08.730
No.

01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:12.532
We cannot wait.

01:26:12.619 --> 01:26:14.575
I must find him.

01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:20.458
I will look through the darkness
of what-has-been.

01:26:50.939 --> 01:26:52.895
I have seen.

01:26:52.979 --> 01:26:54.935
I remember.

01:31:49.939 --> 01:31:52.453
I have told them to wait for the war cry.

01:31:57.500 --> 01:32:00.412
Wait for the war cry.

01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:30.296
Go. This way.

01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:34.336
Go. Go.

01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:53.018
You are not fierce.

01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:27.416
Father,

01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:31.496
we will tell our children

01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:34.094
the story of what you did for us.

01:35:37.460 --> 01:35:40.930
You will always live in our hearts
and in our dreams.

01:35:44.859 --> 01:35:46.895
Tomme, my son.

01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:52.332
Do you see that?

01:35:52.419 --> 01:35:54.296
Do you know what it is?

01:35:54.379 --> 01:35:56.973
Wanadi said it is a big log jam.

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:04.210
Yes. Lots of logs and the river...
cannot flow.

01:36:05.819 --> 01:36:08.128
Because of that log jam,

01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:11.530
more white people will come here

01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:14.851
and enter The World
and cut down more trees

01:36:15.699 --> 01:36:17.974
and take what is yours.

01:36:19.459 --> 01:36:21.575
They will not find us.

01:36:21.659 --> 01:36:23.615
We are The Invisible People.

01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:27.215
They will, Tomme. They will see you.

01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:32.778
Father,

01:36:32.859 --> 01:36:34.975
if that is a log jam,

01:36:35.059 --> 01:36:37.015
water can break it.

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:42.090
A great flood of water can break it.

01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:43.693
No.

01:36:43.779 --> 01:36:46.009
Not this kind of log jam.

01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:50.731
You remember,

01:36:50.819 --> 01:36:53.128
the frogs sing and it rains.

01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:59.098
We will ask the frogs to sing very loudly.

01:40:22.899 --> 01:40:26.016
The water level rose ten feet,
in the last 40 minutes.

01:40:26.099 --> 01:40:29.988
That's within your safety margin.

01:40:31.419 --> 01:40:33.955
I don't know.

01:40:34.379 --> 01:40:37.137
What?

01:40:39.037 --> 01:40:43.000
I could have made a mistake.
- A mistake!

01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:46.995
You!
- You got to evacuate the men!

01:40:47.259 --> 01:40:50.315
You want the men off?

01:41:59.060 --> 01:42:00.698
The rain?

01:42:00.779 --> 01:42:03.896
It has been raining for two days.

01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:10.614
We have been to the river.

01:42:10.699 --> 01:42:12.894
A big flood is coming.

01:43:09.300 --> 01:43:13.259
..and every stream has its spirit snake

01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:17.652
and all the spirit snakes
meet in the big river

01:43:17.739 --> 01:43:20.856
and twist around each other

01:43:20.940 --> 01:43:22.896
to become one of the greatest,

01:43:22.979 --> 01:43:25.573
the greatest spirit of all spirits,

01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:28.333
The Great Anaconda,

01:43:29.099 --> 01:43:32.216
and nothing can stop
The Great Anaconda,

01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:34.575
not even a log jam,

01:43:34.659 --> 01:43:40.416
because it is angry, very, very angry.

01:45:10.739 --> 01:45:13.572
See. Samanpo and Caya.

01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:19.016
And Mapi?

01:45:20.979 --> 01:45:23.049
Mapi and Kaba.

01:45:27.899 --> 01:45:30.208
It is time to settle these matters.

01:45:38.939 --> 01:45:41.214
And Jabuti?

01:45:45.939 --> 01:45:47.930
It will be Pucu

01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:50.375
but they do not know it yet.

01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:54.454
There will be some without men.

01:45:54.539 --> 01:45:57.576
You should marry one or two of them.

01:45:57.660 --> 01:46:00.216
If you say so.

01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:06.456
There is only you, Kachiri.
