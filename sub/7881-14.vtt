See you in three years.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.250
Well, now that
my suit is hung,

00:42.291 --> 00:45.166
it's time for me to show you
something else that's...

00:45.208 --> 00:48.083
well, not-not hung
but super wide.

00:48.125 --> 00:51.166
An 18-wheeler!
I made it at work.

00:51.208 --> 00:53.333
And now sex time.

00:53.375 --> 00:55.500
Slow down. I want
to finish the story

00:55.542 --> 00:57.083
I was telling
you at dinner.

00:57.125 --> 00:58.250
Oh, great.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.625
Where'd I leave off? Oh, yeah.

01:00.667 --> 01:03.125
So, I saw Sandra
at the market today.

01:03.166 --> 01:06.375
She's still having a tough time
dealing with little Jason.

01:06.417 --> 01:08.750
I guess he took a
blender to school and...

01:20.291 --> 01:22.000
Welcome, Mr. Smith.

01:22.041 --> 01:25.417
Back for another evening
of pantomime and shadow?

Stan?

01:35.417 --> 01:36.750
I'm here!
Okay, let's do this.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.458
Stan!
What?

01:38.500 --> 01:39.792
You want
to start individually

01:39.834 --> 01:41.625
and then join forces
for the big finale?

01:41.667 --> 01:44.375
No. I'm tired of you
pretending to listen to me

01:44.417 --> 01:46.125
just so you can
pound this.

01:46.166 --> 01:47.709
It's disrespectful.

01:47.750 --> 01:48.792
What? I was listening.

01:48.834 --> 01:50.583
Oh, really?

01:50.625 --> 01:52.667
Then you won't mind
taking this pop quiz

01:52.709 --> 01:54.625
about everything
I said today.

01:54.667 --> 01:57.333
The gender of Denise's
new baby?

01:57.375 --> 01:59.625
The ethnicity
of your friend Tuvok?

01:59.667 --> 02:02.333
Your maiden name?
These questions are impossible!

02:02.375 --> 02:06.000
Impossible to answer
right now, because...

02:06.041 --> 02:08.709
My stomach!
It hurts so bad!

02:08.750 --> 02:09.834
Oh, brother.

02:09.875 --> 02:12.000
How dare you!
It could be my appendix!

02:12.041 --> 02:16.000
Oh. Well, then you'll need
an ambulance, won't you?

02:27.458 --> 02:29.125
I'm beat.

02:29.166 --> 02:31.291
You know, you tell yourself
you're gonna get this job

02:31.333 --> 02:34.375
at Hearty's and it's gonna
be this great thing, but...

02:34.417 --> 02:35.625
it's not.

02:35.667 --> 02:37.000
So why don't you quit?

02:37.041 --> 02:39.917
I'd love to, but I only
have $1,200 saved.

02:39.959 --> 02:42.583
H-Hold up. $1,200?

02:42.625 --> 02:44.709
Klaus, you can quit your job!

02:44.750 --> 02:47.917
We'll use that money to start a
business and be our own bosses!

02:47.959 --> 02:49.625
I don't know.

02:49.667 --> 02:50.583
What's the business?

02:50.625 --> 02:52.583
Roger and Klaus's Business.

02:52.625 --> 02:54.041
I love it!

02:54.083 --> 02:57.500
Right? I'm thinking we offer
a service or a product

02:57.542 --> 02:58.750
that customers will pay for.

02:58.792 --> 03:00.500
Shh!
Keep your voice down.

03:00.542 --> 03:02.083
People will hear.

03:04.583 --> 03:07.375
Thing is, I already had my
appendix out when I was a kid.

03:07.417 --> 03:08.959
Then what did
they remove?

03:09.000 --> 03:10.542
Some red thing--
I didn't recognize it.

03:10.583 --> 03:12.709
But how could Francine tell
you weren't listening?

03:12.750 --> 03:14.875
Didn't you smile while
she was speaking?

03:14.917 --> 03:15.917
Of course.

03:15.959 --> 03:17.542
Did you remember also to nod?

03:17.583 --> 03:18.542
Uh, yeah.

03:18.583 --> 03:20.000
Then that's
all you can do.

03:20.041 --> 03:22.125
There's no third
thing to listening.

03:22.166 --> 03:25.792
I suppose, but I'd still like
to have sex sometime this year.

03:25.834 --> 03:27.375
She's withholding sex?

03:27.417 --> 03:29.709
Why didn't you
say something?

03:29.750 --> 03:31.083
Pharmacology Department?

03:31.125 --> 03:34.208
Send up a bottle of
Estrocillin right away!

03:34.250 --> 03:35.792
What's Estrocillin?

03:35.834 --> 03:38.333
It's an experimental drug
the CIA has designed

03:38.375 --> 03:42.667
to enable male agents to listen
to female intelligence targets

03:42.709 --> 03:45.250
and actually retain the
information they tell them.

03:45.291 --> 03:47.917
Damn it, why is this fridge
always so full?

03:47.959 --> 03:50.125
That's it. I quit!

03:50.166 --> 03:52.041
Wait, I can't quit.

03:52.083 --> 03:53.500
I've got a family.

03:53.542 --> 03:56.875
Unfortunately, I've already
accepted your resignation.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.083
Ah, Trish. There you are.

03:59.125 --> 04:01.667
Here's the Estrocillin
you requested, sir.

04:01.709 --> 04:02.750
Here you go, Smith.

04:02.792 --> 04:04.208
Take these,
and in no time you'll be

04:04.250 --> 04:06.500
connecting with your wife
all night long.

04:06.542 --> 04:08.000
Gentlemen,

04:08.041 --> 04:09.959
this is the perfect opportunity,
while I have you both here.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.709
I wanted to let
you know that...

04:13.417 --> 04:14.583
What do you hear, sir?

04:14.667 --> 04:16.500
Is it the hum
of an AC unit?

04:16.542 --> 04:18.333
Actually, mine's whales.

04:31.417 --> 04:34.250
Well, we've spent all the money,
but we have our location.

04:34.291 --> 04:36.959
Wow. So much potential.
Right?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.208
All that's left is to figure out
what we're gonna sell,

04:39.250 --> 04:41.125
where we're gonna get it
and how to run

04:41.166 --> 04:42.875
and properly manage
a successful business.

04:42.917 --> 04:45.917
The finishing touches.

05:02.792 --> 05:04.917
Uh, uh, wait, wait, Francine,
uh, don't go to sleep.

05:04.959 --> 05:07.083
I never got to ask you
how your day was.

05:07.125 --> 05:08.500
Very funny, Stan.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.291
No, seriously.
I want to know.

05:10.333 --> 05:11.834
How was your day?

05:13.208 --> 05:14.625
Well...

05:14.667 --> 05:16.375
I just wasn't feeling it.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.667
You know what I mean?
I don't.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.417
But I want to.

05:20.458 --> 05:21.500
Elaborate.

05:22.959 --> 05:25.208
♪ ♪

05:37.625 --> 05:39.166
...then she told her
that she'd never said that

05:39.208 --> 05:42.500
to either of them in the first
place, least of all her.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.542
Not to her, certainly.
Oh, and, Francine,

05:44.583 --> 05:46.792
I'm ready to take
your listening test.

05:46.834 --> 05:49.709
Stan, there's no
time for a test.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.458
I want you immediately.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.542
And I, you.

05:52.583 --> 05:53.875
But first I got to pee.

05:55.709 --> 05:57.917
My insides are squirming
like eels.

05:57.959 --> 05:59.542
What are you doing to me, girl?

05:59.583 --> 06:02.583
Oh, Stan. Pee fast.

06:06.041 --> 06:07.542
Bathroom phone.

06:07.583 --> 06:09.583
Smith! Tell me you
haven't taken the Estrocillin!

06:09.625 --> 06:11.333
Why? What's the prob...

06:34.917 --> 06:36.458
Oh, my God, sir!

06:36.500 --> 06:39.500
Either I've gone crazy,
or I've turned into a woman!

06:39.542 --> 06:40.583
What's the difference?

06:43.667 --> 06:44.959
Hey, screw you!

06:49.625 --> 06:53.542
Stan, get out here
and ravage me.

07:05.875 --> 07:09.125
I have a headache
from all that screaming.

07:09.166 --> 07:10.625
Well, not to compete
with you,

07:10.667 --> 07:13.250
but I have a headache
from my skull changing shape.

07:13.291 --> 07:15.417
How did this happen?
I don't know.

07:15.458 --> 07:18.125
All I did was take this pill,
but the woman at the lab said

07:18.166 --> 07:21.041
nothing about recommended dosage
or possible side effects.

07:21.083 --> 07:24.375
It's imperative that you
only take half a pill.

07:24.417 --> 07:28.458
A whole pill will
transform you into a woman.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.542
You know what? I'm gonna
start making them smaller.

07:31.583 --> 07:34.834
"Increases comprehension
of female chatter."

07:34.875 --> 07:37.875
So this is why you were
listening so well.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.750
I'm sorry. I was just trying
to be a better husband.

07:40.792 --> 07:42.250
Don't I get points
for effort?

07:42.291 --> 07:45.041
Yeah, I guess.

07:45.083 --> 07:46.792
Don't worry.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.000
We'll figure this out.

07:48.041 --> 07:51.875
Are... are your boobs
bigger than mine?

07:51.917 --> 07:53.583
Just different, is all.

07:53.625 --> 07:55.792
In size.

07:58.709 --> 08:00.000
So what's with
the family meeting?

08:01.041 --> 08:02.875
What the hell? Dad?

08:03.834 --> 08:04.750
Kind of.

08:04.792 --> 08:07.291
Kids, your father's...

08:07.333 --> 08:08.792
a woman now.

08:08.834 --> 08:12.417
We all need to process this
as a family,

08:12.458 --> 08:15.834
so if you have any questions,
let's hear them.

08:15.875 --> 08:16.959
I-I don't understand.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.250
That's not a
question, Hayley.

08:18.291 --> 08:20.208
And you don't have to
raise your hand, Steve.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.709
How are you
a woman now?

08:21.750 --> 08:24.375
In every way. From my
ridiculous split ends

08:24.375 --> 08:26.166
to these boots I'm
already sick of.

08:26.208 --> 08:27.750
Wait, so d-does
this mean...

08:27.792 --> 08:29.125
Steve had his hand raised.
Steve.

08:29.166 --> 08:31.709
So, like, are you
gonna wear a bra now?

08:31.750 --> 08:34.083
Absolutely not. Everyone knows
if they're flawless,

08:34.125 --> 08:36.000
you can go braless.
Next question.

08:36.041 --> 08:37.625
Will you...
Oh, Steve beat you by a hair.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.750
Are trains
becoming obsolete?

08:39.792 --> 08:41.000
On the contrary, Steve.

08:41.041 --> 08:43.041
Trains are more relevant
than ever.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.291
Now Hayley.

08:44.333 --> 08:46.291
A-Am I the only one
struggling with this here?

08:46.333 --> 08:48.083
You found a book,
right, Stan?

08:48.125 --> 08:50.291
They didn't have one
where a dad becomes a mom,

08:50.333 --> 08:52.792
so maybe read it backwards.

08:52.834 --> 08:55.458
How does it work
with-with you guys then?

08:55.500 --> 08:57.083
Are you still together?

08:57.125 --> 09:00.583
Yes. We love each other
very much.

09:00.625 --> 09:04.709
So... you're lesbians now?

09:04.750 --> 09:07.291
I... I don't know.

09:08.792 --> 09:11.625
Hey! I figured out what we're
gonna sell for our business.

09:11.667 --> 09:13.083
Stan's suits!

09:13.125 --> 09:15.333
He's got hundreds of them
that he doesn't need anymore.

09:15.375 --> 09:17.750
Is he dead?
Is he finally dead?

09:17.792 --> 09:18.959
Can I go free?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.333
No, he's a woman now.

09:20.375 --> 09:22.375
Oh.

09:22.417 --> 09:24.875
A woman fish?

09:27.583 --> 09:30.166
So... lesbians?

09:30.208 --> 09:31.542
Lesbians.

09:36.583 --> 09:38.542
Don't-don't do that.

09:38.583 --> 09:40.125
I-I don't feel
confident there.

09:40.166 --> 09:41.083
Let me do this.

09:42.917 --> 09:44.667
Hey. Ow, ow.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.959
Stan, what are
you doing?

09:47.000 --> 09:50.417
I don't know, but it feels like
we're trying to make a fire.

09:50.458 --> 09:51.375
This isn't working.

09:51.417 --> 09:53.667
Well, until the
CIA fixes you,

09:53.709 --> 09:55.709
I guess sex is
off the table.

09:55.750 --> 09:58.542
'Cause we are
not lesbians.

09:58.583 --> 09:59.458
We should tell the kids.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.458
Kids, we are not lesbians!

10:01.500 --> 10:03.250
We tried,
but it was a no go!

10:03.291 --> 10:05.417
Please stop
involving me in this!

10:05.458 --> 10:07.291
I am a child!

10:10.417 --> 10:11.709
Agent Smith
reporting for duty.

10:11.750 --> 10:15.208
Come in. Let me
get a look at you.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.959
Do a quick turn for us.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.166
You really do cut quite
a figure as a woman, Smith.

10:21.208 --> 10:24.083
You look exactly
as I imagined.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.333
Only I drew the
hair a bit short.

10:28.375 --> 10:30.625
Well, that's
easily fixed.

10:31.458 --> 10:32.625
There it is.

10:32.667 --> 10:35.458
Any news from the lab on
reversing... all this?

10:35.500 --> 10:37.709
Not yet,
but I'll keep you posted.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.917
Now off to work with you.

10:44.834 --> 10:46.250
Go for Bullock.

10:46.291 --> 10:48.291
Sir, we've successfully
engineered a way

10:48.333 --> 10:50.041
to reverse the effects
of Estrocillin.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.542
Oh, that's exciting.

10:51.583 --> 10:54.041
Shall I notify
Agent Smith?
I'll do it.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.917
We have a thing where he
likes to hear things from me.

10:56.959 --> 10:58.083
It's a thing.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.625
We have it.

11:01.667 --> 11:03.625
This fridge is always full.

11:03.667 --> 11:05.000
We need a second one.

11:05.041 --> 11:07.208
That way, we could
have one for drinks

11:07.250 --> 11:09.667
and the other one
for people's bag lunches.

11:09.709 --> 11:11.291
Hmm, not a bad idea.

11:11.375 --> 11:13.667
I think I should go to
the deputy director with this.

11:13.709 --> 11:15.291
Are you done
having your idea?

11:15.333 --> 11:17.750
Can I get the
Sriracha now?

11:20.166 --> 11:21.500
Thanks for taking me out.

11:21.542 --> 11:22.959
I really needed this.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.542
The girls at work have been
really rough on me.

11:25.583 --> 11:26.959
No respect.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.083
I'm like the Rodney Dangerfield
of that office

11:29.125 --> 11:31.500
because I basically
am dead to them.

11:33.291 --> 11:35.291
Excuse me,
are you Megan Fox?

11:35.333 --> 11:36.417
No.

11:36.458 --> 11:39.542
So you're just
a regular fox.

11:41.583 --> 11:45.041
Stan, as a woman
with an unnecessarily large

11:45.083 --> 11:47.959
and perky bosom, you're
gonna get lots of attention.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.291
Guys will say anything
to try and pick you up,

11:50.333 --> 11:52.083
and some of it's
gonna be tempting.

11:52.125 --> 11:53.917
So I don't look
like Megan Fox?

11:53.959 --> 11:56.458
I know it's all new
and confusing.

11:56.500 --> 11:58.166
Just be careful.

11:58.208 --> 12:01.542
Hopefully, you won't have
to be a woman much longer.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.500
I'll get us another round.

12:03.542 --> 12:06.959
At The K&R Suit Experience,
we have hundreds of suits,

12:07.000 --> 12:08.917
in the only color
you'll ever need.

12:08.959 --> 12:11.291
Blue, blue, this shade of blue!

12:11.333 --> 12:13.333
All suits in stock
are 42 regular.

12:13.375 --> 12:15.125
Smaller than that?
Get it tailored.

12:15.166 --> 12:17.500
There are tailors
all over the city.

12:17.542 --> 12:19.083
Open a phone book.

12:19.125 --> 12:20.834
Are you bigger than 42 regular?

12:20.875 --> 12:21.917
We can't help you.

12:21.959 --> 12:23.208
Look elsewhere!

12:23.250 --> 12:25.959
These prices are so low,
they're driving us mad.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.542
Why are we burning
these suits?

12:27.583 --> 12:28.500
For warmth?

12:28.542 --> 12:31.458
My grip on reality
is weakening!

12:31.500 --> 12:34.083
Must... lower... prices.

12:34.125 --> 12:36.166
K&R Suit Experience
in Little Detroit.

12:36.208 --> 12:37.417
Next to the abandoned
police station.

12:37.458 --> 12:39.458
If you see "God is Dead"
written on the side

12:39.500 --> 12:41.875
of the collapsing overpass,
then you've gone too far!

12:45.667 --> 12:46.583
What do I owe you?

12:46.625 --> 12:48.125
Your drinks have
been paid for, miss.

12:48.166 --> 12:49.625
Shut up.

12:49.667 --> 12:50.834
Deputy Director Bullock.

12:50.875 --> 12:51.917
What are you doing here?

12:51.959 --> 12:53.125
Is there news
from the lab?

12:53.166 --> 12:55.125
Yes, and I'm afraid
it isn't good.

12:55.166 --> 12:56.709
There's no cure
for this.

12:56.750 --> 12:59.750
You'll be a beautiful
woman forever.

12:59.792 --> 13:00.959
Oh, my God.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.792
No time for an honest
emotional response.

13:03.834 --> 13:06.709
We also have urgent CIA
business to attend to.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.375
Oh, uh, let me just
tell Francine.

13:08.417 --> 13:10.792
As I said, no time.
Now let's go.

13:10.834 --> 13:14.041
Yes, sir. I'll grab my pashmina
and meet you out front.

13:15.792 --> 13:17.750
See that woman over there?

13:17.792 --> 13:19.041
I'm going to rail her.

13:19.083 --> 13:21.000
Oh! We got one!

13:21.041 --> 13:22.917

13:22.959 --> 13:24.500

13:36.667 --> 13:38.583
Have you seen
my husband?

13:38.625 --> 13:40.834
Six foot tall?
Dark hair?

13:40.875 --> 13:42.041
Body of a woman?

13:42.083 --> 13:43.333
Oh, that lady.

13:43.375 --> 13:45.667
She left about 20 minutes ago
with some guy.

13:45.709 --> 13:48.125
What? Do you remember
anything about him?

13:48.166 --> 13:51.000
Not much. Only that he was bald,
worked for the CIA,

13:51.041 --> 13:52.667
and sounded like The Beatles.

13:52.709 --> 13:55.208
Not when they sing,
but when they do interviews.

13:55.250 --> 13:56.208
Bullock!

14:00.667 --> 14:02.000
So, what's the
urgent business?

14:02.041 --> 14:05.083
Oh, that. Uh,
yes, well, um...

14:06.250 --> 14:07.667
Ah. Mission cancelled.

14:07.709 --> 14:10.417
Looks like another gumshoe
found Carmen Sandiego for us.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.542
Well, that is good news.

14:11.583 --> 14:13.792
I guess you can
take me back to the bar.

14:13.834 --> 14:16.750
Or we could just
keep driving.

14:16.792 --> 14:19.000
It's rare that I
get one-on-one time

14:19.041 --> 14:20.375
with my employees.

14:20.417 --> 14:23.125
Actually, I was hoping
to talk to you about a solution

14:23.166 --> 14:25.041
to the break room
fridge problem that,

14:25.083 --> 14:27.166
frankly, I'm pretty
excited about.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.959
You ever see one
of these bad boys?

14:33.000 --> 14:36.291
Not many people get the chance
to see the moon while moving.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.500
It's...

14:41.000 --> 14:42.083
Are you okay?

14:42.125 --> 14:45.166
God, I am so sick
of that happening.

14:45.208 --> 14:48.583
But let's not let
it ruin our night.

14:48.625 --> 14:50.959
Anyway, about my idea for
the fridge in the break room...

14:51.000 --> 14:53.458
Yes, I can't wait
to discuss it.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.500
But we should probably
do it somewhere indoors.

14:56.542 --> 14:59.834
Where could we go?
Where could we go?

14:59.875 --> 15:02.750
I suppose we could
go to my place.

15:03.792 --> 15:06.792
I mean, we're already here.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.917
Not one customer all day.

15:11.959 --> 15:13.083
I mean, that dog came in,

15:13.125 --> 15:15.083
but he was just looking
for a place to die.

15:15.125 --> 15:17.375
Eh, let's get
out of here.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.250
Thanks a lot, Obama.

15:24.583 --> 15:25.875
Is this the warehouse
dance party?

15:25.917 --> 15:26.917
Huh?

15:26.959 --> 15:28.291
Flyer says 50 bucks.

15:28.333 --> 15:29.917
This is the place, right?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.083
Oh, uh, yeah.

15:32.125 --> 15:34.250
Yeah, this is the
place you think it is.

15:34.291 --> 15:35.375
Head on in.

15:35.417 --> 15:36.792
Head on in.

15:36.834 --> 15:39.083
Text your friends,
tell them you found it.

15:42.417 --> 15:43.959
Stan?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.250
Stan?!

15:47.709 --> 15:49.417
Sorry to interrupt
your science,

15:49.458 --> 15:51.959
but have you seen
my husband Stan Smith?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.166
Anatomically a woman.

15:53.208 --> 15:54.875
Agent Smith is
still a woman?

15:54.917 --> 15:56.291
Well, yeah.

15:56.333 --> 15:57.959
We're still waiting on a cure.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.291
There is a cure.

15:59.333 --> 16:02.417
A simple pill that'll
turn Stan back into a man.

16:02.458 --> 16:04.667
Bullock was
supposed to tell him.

16:04.709 --> 16:06.250
Apparently they have a thing.

16:06.291 --> 16:07.834
Wait a minute.

16:07.875 --> 16:10.250
Then Bullock's
keeping Stan a woman

16:10.291 --> 16:11.750
so he can sleep with him.

16:11.792 --> 16:13.625
I have to find out
where they are.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.417
Well, if Bullock's
trying to seal the deal,

16:15.458 --> 16:16.834
they're probably at his house.

16:16.875 --> 16:19.208
That's where he likes
to have his sex.

16:20.792 --> 16:22.542
There.
Two glasses of zin,

16:22.583 --> 16:25.500
some pickled ginger,
a bowl of clementines.

16:25.542 --> 16:28.500
The scene is set to
discuss work concerns.

16:28.542 --> 16:29.834
Well, as we both know,

16:29.875 --> 16:32.834
the situation with the fridge
has become untenable.

16:32.875 --> 16:35.291
My proposal:
a second fridge.

16:35.333 --> 16:36.917
Where would we put it,
you ask?

16:36.959 --> 16:38.667
Put it where the Fruitopia
vending machine is.

16:38.709 --> 16:41.375
I mean, we can keep waiting
for the guy to come back

16:41.417 --> 16:43.542
and restock it,
but it's been 12 years.

16:43.583 --> 16:44.667
It's time to move on.

16:44.709 --> 16:46.083
Intriguing.

16:46.125 --> 16:47.709
Very intriguing.

16:47.750 --> 16:49.875
Oh, I'm so glad
you're into it.

16:49.917 --> 16:50.959
Open.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.583
Yes, enjoy that, Smith.

16:52.625 --> 16:54.625
It's the last thing
you'll put in your mouth

16:54.667 --> 16:56.375
a little at a time.

16:56.417 --> 16:59.709
Come on, come on!
Get out of my way!

16:59.750 --> 17:01.750
I love what
I've heard so far.

17:01.792 --> 17:03.458
You have to
tell me more.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.792
Well, I'm just saying,
if we have two fridges,

17:05.834 --> 17:08.625
then we essentially
double our capacity.

17:08.667 --> 17:11.750
You know, I have
over four swords.

17:11.792 --> 17:13.000
Hai-yah!

17:14.166 --> 17:16.291
Oops.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.250
That's the exact
same car as mine.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.583
Oh, no!

17:36.625 --> 17:39.000
Do I have a man's haircut?

17:39.041 --> 17:41.333
And people don't want to put
their lunches in the door

17:41.375 --> 17:43.333
because it sometimes
squishes the sandwiches.

17:43.375 --> 17:46.166
So, Smith, now that you're
a woman permanently,

17:46.208 --> 17:49.625
you and your wife probably
won't be getting it on, eh?

17:49.667 --> 17:51.792
No, I guess not.

17:51.834 --> 17:53.208
We'll just be friends.

17:53.250 --> 17:54.250
Best friends.

17:54.291 --> 17:55.792
Seems like a best friend

17:55.834 --> 17:58.583
would want you to have
all your needs met.

17:58.625 --> 18:00.208
Sir, what are you saying?

18:00.250 --> 18:01.792
Look in the mirror, bro.

18:01.834 --> 18:05.792
You're a red-hot mama and your
body is crying out for a man.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.583
Let me be that man.

18:07.625 --> 18:10.041
I... I-I don't know.

18:10.083 --> 18:12.834
You're telling me you haven't
wondered what it'd be like

18:12.875 --> 18:15.500

changed genders

18:15.542 --> 18:18.166

pharmacological mishap?

21:16.041 --> 21:17.250
Oh, crap! Cops!

21:22.166 --> 21:23.458
Who's responsible
for this?

21:23.500 --> 21:25.041
Who's in charge here?

21:25.083 --> 21:27.625
Oh, uh, you know, I think
it's a guy named Lazer.

21:27.667 --> 21:29.792
Haven't seen him
in a while.

21:29.834 --> 21:31.625
Bye! Have a beautiful time.
