WEBVTT

00:08.173 --> 00:11.878
We're back and things are
about to get fucking naughty.

00:12.712 --> 00:14.080
(screaming)

00:14.147 --> 00:17.117
It's going to be bigger
than ever before.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.486
Cheers!

00:19.552 --> 00:20.920
More kissing.

00:21.454 --> 00:22.689
Getting fucked up.

00:24.290 --> 00:28.294
Arguing.
(shouting)

00:28.361 --> 00:29.529
Tears.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.198
Bring it on.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.468
Let's get fucking mortal!

00:36.336 --> 00:38.238
Aaron might get lucky tonight.

00:38.304 --> 00:41.174
Maybe I shouldn't have invited
that girl, shit.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.610
Aaron has been all over that girl.

00:45.044 --> 00:46.780
Whoa. Shit.

00:46.846 --> 00:49.449
Mate, I'm really sorry.
I thought we were mates.

00:54.154 --> 00:55.155
(screams)

00:57.524 --> 00:59.058
I just need me mam.

00:59.125 --> 01:01.428
Tonight was meant to be a fantasy,

01:01.494 --> 01:03.997
but it's a fucking nightmare.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.403
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:10.470 --> 01:13.039
I am a Geordie girl,
with a VIP Edge.

01:13.106 --> 01:15.642
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

01:15.708 --> 01:17.644
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.779
I never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

01:19.846 --> 01:21.881
The hardest graft I've
done is me hair.

01:21.948 --> 01:23.583
Colourful, full of mischief.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.685
I'm fit, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.321
I'm gonna make sparks fly
and get everyone Feisty.

01:28.388 --> 01:30.490
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

01:36.196 --> 01:38.731
See you, babe, safe journey home.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.804
Have you seen me foot, man?

01:47.674 --> 01:49.843
What is going through
that kid's head?

01:49.909 --> 01:53.646
I still can't believe that Kyle
necked down his best mate, Marnie,

01:53.713 --> 01:56.149
knowing for a fact
Aaron's getting with her.

01:56.216 --> 01:57.851
What was he playing at?

01:59.052 --> 02:00.987
Right, don't get us wrong.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.556
But not half as angry as
with that prick.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.158
I'm finished with the kid.

02:05.225 --> 02:06.860
Kyle can fuck off.

02:06.926 --> 02:10.029
He can apologise all he wants
but for now that's us done.

02:14.400 --> 02:17.403
Last night it kicked off
between Kyle and the lads,

02:17.470 --> 02:21.174
but I was too preoccupied with Kate
to even realise what was going on.

02:21.241 --> 02:22.242
How you feeling?

02:23.877 --> 02:26.613
Fucking killing that.
What did you actually do?

02:27.881 --> 02:30.450
I can't even remember, mate.

02:30.517 --> 02:35.221
All I know is that I've kissed
Marnie and I've stupidly done it.

02:35.288 --> 02:39.425
Last night I kissed Marnie, today
I'm dreading speaking to Aaron.

02:43.496 --> 02:46.933
In the middle of every single game,
every single argument,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.236
every single fight, every single
punch up is Marnie.

02:50.303 --> 02:53.206
What Marnie and Kyle did was
completely out of order.

02:53.273 --> 02:54.941
They shouldn't have necked on.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.011
Marnie's using Kyle as a pawn
in this stupid little game.

02:58.077 --> 03:01.781
She's used him to get back at Aaron,

03:01.848 --> 03:05.785
which in turn has then now made
all the lads dislike Kyle.

03:05.852 --> 03:09.322
Maybe it's just best she stays gone
for a while, sorts her head out

03:09.389 --> 03:13.026
and we get to live an easy life.

03:22.235 --> 03:23.269
Hi, Anna.

03:23.336 --> 03:25.972
Anna rings, she's gonna kick off
about the party

03:26.039 --> 03:29.175
or we've gotta go to work.
Either way it's never good news.

03:32.612 --> 03:34.514
OK, brilliant, yeah, no problem.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.219
Fucking hell.

03:40.286 --> 03:43.723
For once the stupid bint's actually
got some good news to give us.

03:43.790 --> 03:47.226
Now that, Anna, is the type of phone
call I like to fucking answer.

03:47.293 --> 03:49.429
There's good news
and there's bad news.

03:49.495 --> 03:52.398
The bad news is we've all
got to go to work tonight.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.767
What?!
Tonight?!

03:54.834 --> 03:56.769
The good news is it's in Paris.

03:56.836 --> 03:59.038
(screaming)

03:59.105 --> 04:01.341
It's in Paris!

04:01.407 --> 04:03.409
Je m'appelle fuckan massive.

04:03.476 --> 04:05.745
Get your passports, get packed.

04:05.812 --> 04:09.616
I'm absolutely over the moon.
Je m'appelle Scotty Fucking T.

04:09.682 --> 04:12.385
(screaming)
Buzzing!

04:16.656 --> 04:19.692
The French are ridiculously good
looking and stylish,

04:19.759 --> 04:20.760
I'll fit in well.

04:20.827 --> 04:23.296
I just feel a bit sorry
for the rest of them.

04:25.531 --> 04:28.568
I'm having an absolute nightmare,
I can't find my beret.

04:28.635 --> 04:31.371
Think we'll get a chance to do
some sightseeing?

04:31.437 --> 04:33.740
I wanna go and see the Eiffel Tower.

04:33.806 --> 04:35.908
The Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe.

04:35.975 --> 04:38.111
The Leaning Tower of Piza.
In Italy.

04:40.246 --> 04:42.382
I'm gutted Marnie's not coming.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.517
Most of the lads
aren't speaking to us

04:44.584 --> 04:47.987
and I feel like this trip
could be a bit shit.

04:48.054 --> 04:49.922
I'm so glad Marnie's not coming.

04:49.989 --> 04:53.893
I just wanna have a good time with
all the others and ignore Kyle.

04:55.561 --> 04:59.365
(girls chant) Paris! Paris! Paris!

04:59.432 --> 05:01.300
Bags are packed and we're ready.

05:01.367 --> 05:04.771
Bring on the French birds
in their French knickers.

05:04.837 --> 05:06.706
Paris!

05:06.773 --> 05:11.477
# Paris, Paris, you make me
Weak at the knee, Paris #

05:12.679 --> 05:15.648
Hopefully we'll leave the house,
leave the drama behind

05:15.715 --> 05:17.550
and we all have a fucking good time.

05:18.685 --> 05:21.821
(girls chant) Paris! Paris! Paris!

05:21.888 --> 05:26.059
We're at the airport, we're one step
closer to the City of Love.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.294
Get me on this plane now.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.069
Paris! Paris!

05:36.135 --> 05:39.238
Bonjour, Paris.
The Geordies have arrived.

05:49.849 --> 05:50.850
Yeah.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.322
What do you think French women
are like?

05:56.389 --> 05:59.525
The French people love a good pube.

05:59.592 --> 06:02.495
Well, I've got plenty of them,
Frenchies!

06:07.834 --> 06:10.002
I couldn't give a fuck
if they're hairy.

06:10.069 --> 06:13.372
If they're fit I'll just go
through them with me lawn mower.

06:15.908 --> 06:19.479
Char, run! We get to the apartment
and we'll have to be first

06:19.545 --> 06:22.849
because we will get
the best bedroom.

06:26.252 --> 06:30.056
Good choice.
Ooh, I'm having this, nice one.

06:31.324 --> 06:34.127
This one. Bang bang.

06:34.193 --> 06:35.762
I was first on this floor.

06:35.828 --> 06:38.297
I can't believe
that Anna's put we up here.

06:38.364 --> 06:40.700
Gaz has got a tree house for a bed.

06:40.767 --> 06:45.138
To be honest, I actually think
we've got the best room. We did, aye.

06:45.204 --> 06:48.107
I'm glad I'm not staying with
Aaron or Gary.

06:48.174 --> 06:51.177
It's awkward between me and Aaron,
but not just that,

06:51.244 --> 06:55.214
I think Gary's an arsehole
for jumping on Aaron's side.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.216
He's done ten times worse.

06:57.283 --> 07:01.721
I do feel sorry for Kyle. All the
lads didn't wanna share with him.

07:01.788 --> 07:05.792
He did make a mistake but there's
no need for the lads to isolate him.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.603
I'm so excited about Paris.

07:17.670 --> 07:20.239
Things with Mitch
haven't been going well

07:20.306 --> 07:23.009
and this trip could be a chance
to clear me head.

07:23.075 --> 07:25.278
I'm excited for tonight.
So am I.

07:25.344 --> 07:27.413
Are we gonna start getting ready?

07:28.548 --> 07:30.516
I'm buzzing, first night in Paris.

07:30.583 --> 07:31.851
Yes, there's tension,

07:31.918 --> 07:35.154
but who gives a fuck, we're only
here once, let's smash it.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.161
Come on!

07:43.763 --> 07:48.100
First night out in Paris.
Whoop, whoop!

07:48.167 --> 07:52.605
I am literally frothing from the
foof about our first night in Paris.

07:52.672 --> 07:57.443
No one, and I say no one,
is as excited as I am right now.

08:00.112 --> 08:02.648
We've got work tonight,
but first things first,

08:02.715 --> 08:06.652
we're gonna have a family meal French
style. Bonjour, you fucking Ragee.

08:06.719 --> 08:08.621
Let's all get a nice glass of wine.

08:08.688 --> 08:12.158
At dinner, Kyle sat at one end of
the table and I'm sat at the other,

08:12.225 --> 08:14.560
we couldn't be farther apart,
suits me.

08:19.565 --> 08:22.168
Bordeaux. What's Bordeaux?
It's a wine area.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.502
Got any Prosecco?

08:23.569 --> 08:26.706
The others don't know about wine
but I've got it down to a T.

08:26.772 --> 08:28.307
Scotty Fucking T. Come on.

08:28.374 --> 08:30.576
Two bottles of red
and a bottle of white.

08:30.643 --> 08:34.179
Scott is giving it the biggun
like he's some sort of sommelier.

08:34.246 --> 08:39.284
Mm. I'm getting overtones of
pretentious fucking wanker!

08:39.352 --> 08:42.688
Anyway, guys.
First night in Paris.

08:44.624 --> 08:47.260
Oh!
That's a nice one, mind.

08:47.326 --> 08:50.963
I want yous all to have a really
good time at work so just have fun.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.132
Let's get drunk,
let's just enjoy it.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.534
We're in Paris and we've decided

08:55.601 --> 08:59.705
while we're here we've got to try
some local delicacies.

08:59.772 --> 09:02.375
Oh, no!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

09:02.441 --> 09:04.844
What the fuck?
Why would you eat snails?

09:04.911 --> 09:08.881
Right, who's going first?
I'm going for it, me.

09:08.948 --> 09:13.085
They're unreal. Gaz, it's lush.
One, two, three, four.

09:16.956 --> 09:19.725
Holly's being a pussy
about trying the snails,

09:19.792 --> 09:24.630
should tell her they're cock flavour,
she'll munch the whole bowl.

09:36.776 --> 09:40.346
If things weren't awkward enough
Aaron just made it worse.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.815
I'm just glad Marnie's
not here to see this.

09:42.882 --> 09:43.883
(all) Cheers!

09:46.118 --> 09:48.087
(James) Mince night?

09:49.322 --> 09:51.123
Whoa!
Whoa!

09:51.190 --> 09:52.291
The boss is pissed!

09:52.358 --> 09:54.327
Vicky is fucking mortal.

09:54.393 --> 09:58.197
Well, this is a good example to set,
should I follow your lead, boss?

09:58.264 --> 09:59.665
Let's go.

09:59.732 --> 10:03.602
Vicky is the boss, we haven't even
got to work yet and she's pissed.

10:03.669 --> 10:06.005
It's only gonna be downhill
from here.

10:07.206 --> 10:08.374
Cheers.

10:10.476 --> 10:12.945
Kyle sits next to us.
What does he want?

10:15.748 --> 10:17.616
Kyle can fuck off.

10:17.683 --> 10:19.685
Gaz and Kyle start kicking off.

10:19.752 --> 10:23.889
You were cracking on with Marnie.
No, I wasn't. Fuck off right now.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.424
Gary can go fuck himself.

10:46.245 --> 10:49.949
Vicky's got us hosting a Tash on
Tours boat party for French singles.

10:50.016 --> 10:53.185
Don't you worry, we'll have them
necking on the Geordie way.

10:53.252 --> 10:57.923
Bonjour, Paris! Ca va?

10:57.990 --> 11:01.360
J'adore France.
That's good news, yeah?

11:01.427 --> 11:04.597
I get to work and it hits me
like a ton of bricks

11:04.663 --> 11:07.366
that I am slightly drunker
than usual.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.135
French wine is fucking strong.

11:09.201 --> 11:14.306
Je m'appelle Vicky.
Yes, you've got it right, pet.

11:14.373 --> 11:15.975
Vicky's French is terrible.

11:16.042 --> 11:19.645
I don't know if it's because she's
pissed or because she's thick,

11:19.712 --> 11:21.447
but this isn't going very well.

11:21.514 --> 11:25.651
We're gonna play some drinking games.
Who wants to get pissed?

11:25.718 --> 11:28.521
These French people are being
so fucking boring,

11:28.587 --> 11:30.856
I'm gonna spice this party right up.

11:30.923 --> 11:35.828
My name is Charlotte
and I prefer cock.

11:35.895 --> 11:38.297
Vicky's bad enough,
then Charlotte pipes up,

11:38.364 --> 11:40.666
"Je m'appelle Charlotte
and I love cock."

11:40.733 --> 11:42.201
Fuck it, I'm gonna step in.

11:46.906 --> 11:49.442
The first game is the baguette game.

11:49.508 --> 11:52.845
Control something massive and hard
between your legs.

11:52.912 --> 11:55.381
How hard can it be?
I do that every night.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.383
Floppy man!

11:57.450 --> 12:00.252
I hope they're ready for Scotty T's
grande baguette.

12:00.319 --> 12:01.887
Three, two, one, go!

12:12.364 --> 12:15.868
Scott and Gary act like they're doing
me a favour by taking over,

12:15.935 --> 12:19.205
but we all know it's not the case,
they just can't wait to lord it

12:19.271 --> 12:21.874
over us that I've made a mistake.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.178
I need two girls.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.347
The next game is
the lap dancing game.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.983
The girl sits down
and the lad dances on them.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.885
They actually seemed quite game.

12:38.824 --> 12:42.461
I'm getting a lap dance off
not one, but two men.

12:42.528 --> 12:44.563
It's like the fucking Moulin Rouge.

12:47.666 --> 12:50.669
Anna should be so proud,
we've literally smashed it.

12:53.305 --> 12:56.442
The French people are looking at us
like we're from Mars.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.945
Haven't you ever tried to deep
throat a massive baguette,

13:00.012 --> 13:01.413
like it's a huge penis?

13:02.314 --> 13:03.749
Baguette fight.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.424
Come on, come on.

13:12.491 --> 13:16.095
Work was boxed off. Now it's off to
the club to show these Paris people

13:16.162 --> 13:18.264
how us Geordies
like to fucking party.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.733
Now let's hit the fucking club.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.203
Ow, I just knocked my head.

13:27.840 --> 13:32.611
We're in the club and it's bouncing.
This is amazing.

13:39.885 --> 13:42.621
I'm in the club
and Kyle comes and sits next to us.

13:42.688 --> 13:44.123
What the fuck does he want?

13:51.530 --> 13:55.668
I just wanted to explain
what happened and apologise.

14:03.075 --> 14:06.412
Kyle's apologising and his only
defence is Marnie kissed him.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.914
Takes two to tango, mate,
you shoulda said no.

14:22.361 --> 14:25.965
Aaron, I'm sorry I necked on with
your bird, simple as, let's move on.

14:36.108 --> 14:38.277
As far as I'm concerned
Kyle can fuck off.

14:38.344 --> 14:41.213
Apologise all he wants,
you fucking two faced prick.

14:46.852 --> 14:48.687
Who ordered a round of tequila?

14:48.754 --> 14:53.692
Probablys me because I'm so wild
and crazy in Paris. Cheers.

15:09.108 --> 15:12.645
Even though we're not as close as we
were, we are friends.

15:12.711 --> 15:15.147
I can always rely on us
having a wicked laugh.

15:29.228 --> 15:32.197
Gary's teasing us saying
I've got me Gary smile on,

15:32.264 --> 15:36.835
"No, Gary, I've got me Paris smile
on." Total different thing.

15:45.744 --> 15:48.814
It feels so nice to be relaxed
and have fun with Gary.

15:48.881 --> 15:52.184
It's been so long since we've
laughed this hard together.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.495
I've had a wicked first night,

16:03.562 --> 16:07.566
but it's time to get our arses
out this club and back to bed.

16:14.473 --> 16:19.011
Charlotte is hammered and trying
to get in the taxi with the boys.

16:19.078 --> 16:21.680
Me and Vicky are trying to
keep her away from Gary,

16:21.747 --> 16:23.949
we can feel her
gravitating towards him.

16:24.016 --> 16:26.719
You are unreal.

16:28.554 --> 16:30.622
Yes, yes.
Very incredible.

16:30.689 --> 16:32.558
Come on. This is me.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.427
(Kyle) You don't like us?
(Gary) Nah.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.662
The fuck have I done?

16:36.729 --> 16:39.898
The minute you went in the house,
you fucking lied.

16:39.965 --> 16:41.266
How is it a fucking lie?

16:41.333 --> 16:44.570
We've all had a mint night but
Gaz and Kyle start kicking off

16:44.636 --> 16:46.205
and we know what it's about.

16:46.271 --> 16:48.040
You were cracking on with Marnie.

16:48.107 --> 16:51.744
No, I wasn't, no, I wasn't.
You can fuck off right now.

16:51.810 --> 16:55.647
I'm asking Kyle questions but
he's getting angry and kicking off.

16:55.714 --> 16:58.283
Angry people
are always hiding something.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.987
Why don't me and Aaron just sort it
and everyone else stay out of it?

17:02.054 --> 17:03.055
Simple as.

17:03.122 --> 17:06.157
You and Aaron sort it out
and if you and Aaron become mates.

17:06.224 --> 17:09.627
I accept he doesn't accept my
apology and I am willing to sit here

17:09.694 --> 17:15.166
and say sorry until accepts me
apology, don't get involved, mate.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.736
The only person
I want to apologise to is Aaron.

17:17.803 --> 17:20.038
To be honest,
Gary can go and fuck himself.

17:27.346 --> 17:32.451
Hello house. Bonjour home.
Bonjour ma maison.

17:32.518 --> 17:36.121
I've had enough of this. I can't
be round these fucking pricks.

17:36.188 --> 17:39.291
I'm sick of Gary, I'm sick of Aaron,
I'm going to bed.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.999
Safe to say
we're all absolutely mortal.

17:47.065 --> 17:50.002
Drink in Paris must be stronger
than in Newcastle.

17:50.068 --> 17:51.370
I can't deal with this.

17:52.271 --> 17:54.606
I'm pissed
and I'm having such a good time

17:54.673 --> 17:59.645
and I just want a cuddle from Gary.
No one else, just Gary.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.148
Tonight was amazing,

18:03.215 --> 18:06.185
but I never expected Charlotte
to get back to the house,

18:06.251 --> 18:09.888
be running round after us
trying to get in me room.

18:17.429 --> 18:20.132
I might be pissed,
I might have fucked up at work

18:20.199 --> 18:25.204
but there is no chance I am allowing
Charlotte to go anywhere near Gary.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.638
Not on my watch.

18:26.705 --> 18:31.276
Let me go. Need to let me go.

18:31.343 --> 18:35.080
Charlotte is absolutely smashed but
there's only so much pinning down

18:35.147 --> 18:38.116
that I can do
before she slaps me in the face.

18:38.183 --> 18:39.985
Out.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.654
And you've won.
That's enough of this.

18:44.923 --> 18:50.028
Oh, fuck off, Vicky. I only wanna
cuddle, a midnight chat.

18:50.095 --> 18:53.198
We're friends now.
I'll keep me pants on.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.268
Night.

18:58.203 --> 19:01.173
Charlotte might just have wanted to
come in my room,

19:01.240 --> 19:03.208
lie in bed and have a bit of banter.

19:03.275 --> 19:06.645
But do not fear for bouncer Vicky's
there to grab Charlotte

19:06.712 --> 19:08.447
and put her to bed. Cheers Vicky.

19:08.514 --> 19:10.249
(Vicky) Oh, thank God.

19:12.451 --> 19:15.087
(Kyle) Oh, God.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.563
Paris really is the most romantic
city in the entire world.

19:24.630 --> 19:29.234
If the Eiffel Tower was a penis,
I'd let it come all over my face.

19:29.768 --> 19:31.737
It's horrible seeing Charlotte cry.

19:31.803 --> 19:35.440
I know Mitch is gonna be angry at us
for spending time with Gary.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.376
I really don't know what to do.

20:05.003 --> 20:08.640
I am.

20:15.614 --> 20:18.717
Last night was a disaster
of biblical proportions.

20:18.784 --> 20:22.788
Not only did I get fucking mortal at
work, Charlotte followed Gary around

20:22.854 --> 20:26.925
all night trying to jump on his
pain au chocolat. Sacre bleu!

20:28.594 --> 20:32.898
Yeah, I was trying to contain you
like a wild boar for two hours.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.533
Me and Gary are just friends,

20:34.600 --> 20:37.069
I was probably just going
to have a little chat.

20:37.135 --> 20:40.038
We probably made it worse
trying to keep you contained,

20:40.105 --> 20:42.207
but we were just worried.

20:42.274 --> 20:44.977
The last thing Charlotte wants is

20:45.043 --> 20:48.814
the one person who used to fuck her
over countless times in the past.

20:50.482 --> 20:55.253
Char, don't cry. It's just natural
for you to gravitate towards Gary

20:55.320 --> 20:58.156
because, well, if I'm honest,

20:58.223 --> 21:01.793
you're not really getting any
attention from Mitch, are ya?

21:04.596 --> 21:08.500
I know Mitch is gonna be angry at us
for spending time with Gary.

21:08.567 --> 21:12.037
I know that if Mitch found out
he would literally never forgive us.

21:12.104 --> 21:16.375
Like, I've always felt so happy
with him until now

21:16.441 --> 21:19.044
and like I really
don't know what to do.

21:30.756 --> 21:34.660
Last night Kyle tried to apologise
and said Marnie kissed him.

21:34.726 --> 21:36.595
Sorry, apology not accepted.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.407
I've come here to enjoy meself,

21:48.473 --> 21:51.276
I'm not gonna let him
ruin Paris for us.

21:52.277 --> 21:54.513
Yo, yo, yo.
Hiya. Alright?

21:55.080 --> 21:57.249
Me and Charlotte are close,

21:57.315 --> 22:00.018
one of my best mates
and I wanna make sure she's OK.

22:00.085 --> 22:02.087
My business is
having a laugh with you

22:02.154 --> 22:04.222
and cheering you up, having a giggle.

22:04.289 --> 22:07.092
Yeah, I want you to be there for us
as a friend.

22:07.159 --> 22:10.696
So you're going through a rough
patch, it's my job to cheer you up

22:10.762 --> 22:13.932
and that's what I did.
We had a laugh, you got pissed...

22:13.999 --> 22:17.002
And it was so nice to just finally
let me hair down,

22:17.069 --> 22:21.139
like I feel so like just awful
about this whole Mitch thing.

22:21.206 --> 22:23.408
I know.

22:23.475 --> 22:25.210
It's fine.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.245
It's horrible seeing Charlotte cry.

22:27.312 --> 22:30.682
I wanna be the good guy for once,
cheer her up and make her happy.

22:35.053 --> 22:38.290
Me and Gary are close and I feel
like I can talk to him

22:38.356 --> 22:41.893
about these kind of things because
even though he hurt us in the past

22:41.960 --> 22:45.597
he doesn't want to see us
get hurt by someone else.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.539
Second day in Paris
and we've got no work.

22:54.606 --> 22:57.209
It's time to smash this city
Geordie style.

22:57.275 --> 22:59.745
There's a couple of things
we have to do today.

22:59.811 --> 23:04.716
A boat trip down the river Seine
is like must do in Paris.

23:04.783 --> 23:07.385
But if you wanna be more
adventurous...

23:08.520 --> 23:10.255
I'll do boat.
OK, boat.

23:12.390 --> 23:15.961
Me and the lads have decided
we're gonna go out, hire some bikes

23:16.027 --> 23:19.164
and mission round Paris, wonky foot
has to sit on the boat

23:19.231 --> 23:20.832
with the girls. Ill!

23:24.369 --> 23:28.607
I can't wait for me first day out in
Paris to see what it's got to offer.

23:29.808 --> 23:31.810
Today is gonna be boatilicious.

23:34.746 --> 23:38.250
Musee de Louvre which is the Louvre.
The what?

23:38.316 --> 23:40.485
The Musee de Louvre.
De Lubre?

23:40.552 --> 23:41.853
De Louvre.
De Lubre?

23:41.920 --> 23:45.157
This bunch of uncultured buffoons
could be taking a boat trip

23:45.223 --> 23:47.592
down the Tyne
for the notice they're taking.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.163
Mona Lisa lives in where?
The Louvre.

24:00.305 --> 24:01.439
Tour de France.

24:01.506 --> 24:03.308
The best hangover cure ever.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.610
The lads on bikes
cruising round Paris,

24:05.677 --> 24:09.681
looking at all the sights in
blistering sun. Paris, ooh la la.

24:09.748 --> 24:12.551
Je m'appelle shit on a bike.
Fuck.

24:18.190 --> 24:22.060
James is all over the place.
We should have got stabilisers.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.228
James there's a bus!

24:26.565 --> 24:30.769
Fuck that was close. I nearly ended
up putting a hole in that bus.

24:41.413 --> 24:42.781
Do you know what I mean?

24:42.848 --> 24:45.984
I feel really sorry for Kyle
because at the end of the day

24:46.051 --> 24:47.485
nobody is speaking to him,

24:47.552 --> 24:50.922
it's not anybody else's argument
except his and Aaron's.

24:52.490 --> 24:53.925
No one's perfect, are they?

24:53.992 --> 24:57.329
Yeah, we all make mistakes
and I just hope it gets sorted out.

24:58.730 --> 25:02.300
What's that there?
Oh, my God, that's amazing!

25:02.367 --> 25:05.136
We eventually spot
the giant Paris erection,

25:05.203 --> 25:07.439
also known as the Eiffel Tower.

25:07.505 --> 25:10.308
That'll look nice
when the lights are on, won't it?

25:10.375 --> 25:13.545
That's amazing that, like.
That is amazing.

25:13.612 --> 25:17.449
The boat trip's been lovely.
We've seen some sights,

25:17.515 --> 25:19.918
but now it's time to
get back to the house.

25:27.025 --> 25:29.895
Let's get ready.

25:32.397 --> 25:35.267
I am so excited for the last night
in Paris.

25:35.333 --> 25:38.236
I just hope that we leave
the city of love all as friends.

25:38.303 --> 25:41.406
I don't know if tonight
can top last night, it was so good.

25:41.473 --> 25:43.708
It was good, wasn't it?

25:47.078 --> 25:50.482
It's our last night in Paris
and we don't want any tension,

25:50.548 --> 25:54.052
so Kyle and Aaron better grab their
lady balls and kiss and make up.

26:05.964 --> 26:08.800
We've had an amazing day off,
seen the sights,

26:08.867 --> 26:12.570
time to enjoy our last night in
Paris with the Geordie Shore family.

26:16.508 --> 26:19.177
To the last night in Paris.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.780
Tonight is the last night in Paris

26:21.846 --> 26:25.250
and I'm so excited to smash it
with the whole family.

26:29.754 --> 26:32.958
Tonight
I will do everything in my power

26:33.024 --> 26:35.293
to get these two boys
speaking again.

26:45.303 --> 26:48.540
Time for me and Charlotte
to put our plan into action.

26:48.606 --> 26:52.277
We are gonna make sure that Aaron
and Kyle leave Paris as friends.

26:54.512 --> 26:55.947
First part of the plan,

26:56.014 --> 26:58.650
get Kyle and Aaron
to stand together.

26:58.717 --> 27:02.887
If they're kissing
they might as well speak, right?

27:08.293 --> 27:12.097
Another game that can only bring
happy things towards Aaron and Kyle.

27:12.163 --> 27:15.233
Say something nice about
the person standing next to ya.

27:31.116 --> 27:34.819
For fuck's sake, Scott, I'm trying
to get Kyle and Aaron back together

27:34.886 --> 27:37.789
not push them further apart,
you giant wally!

27:39.891 --> 27:41.926
I'm only joking!
Be nice.

27:47.565 --> 27:50.301
This hasn't gone as well
as I thought it was gonna go.

27:50.368 --> 27:53.438
Kyle and Aaron aren't exactly
best friends again,

27:53.505 --> 27:55.607
but everyone loves a trier.

28:04.816 --> 28:07.786
At least Kyle stayed around
and faced up to his problems,

28:07.852 --> 28:11.089
he's apologised, said sorry
and there's nothing more he can do

28:11.156 --> 28:13.591
and Aaron should respect him
for doing that.

28:28.373 --> 28:31.543
I'm sorting things out
because this can't go on any longer.

28:31.609 --> 28:33.244
At least he faced his problems.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.495
I feel terrible.

28:50.562 --> 28:54.032
I should never have gone behind
Aaron's back and kissed Marnie.

29:08.246 --> 29:09.347
They're making up.

29:09.414 --> 29:14.752
What a buzz, what a buzz, what
a buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz buzzing!

29:27.398 --> 29:31.069
I'm glad me and Aaron are friends,
now we can have a mint night.

29:47.952 --> 29:50.522
Paris night life is mint.
I wish I could be French

29:50.588 --> 29:53.491
and stay here for ever,
but I think my boobs are too big.

30:03.168 --> 30:05.503
It's been an amazing last night
in Paris,

30:05.570 --> 30:08.806
now we're off to the Eiffel Tower
to see the light show.

30:11.409 --> 30:13.511
Oh, my God!

30:17.148 --> 30:20.685
We get to the Eiffel Tower
and it looks absolutely amazing,

30:20.752 --> 30:22.353
I love everyone.

30:31.596 --> 30:34.732
Even after everything she's done,
I wish Marnie was here.

30:34.799 --> 30:38.369
It's not the same without her and
she'd love to see the Eiffel Tower.

30:41.839 --> 30:44.709
We're in Paris, standing
in front of the Eiffel Tower.

30:44.776 --> 30:49.080
All standing there linking arms,
smiling, we actually look happy.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.054
(laughs)

30:56.120 --> 30:59.557
Paris really is the most
romantic city in the entire world

30:59.624 --> 31:02.360
and although I'm not sharing it
with someone I love,

31:02.427 --> 31:06.531
I'm sharing it with loads of people
who I love, my family.

31:06.598 --> 31:08.366
(screaming)

31:10.635 --> 31:14.439
So cute!
It's so flashy.

31:17.075 --> 31:19.477
That is mint that though, innit?

31:19.544 --> 31:24.382
I'm overwhelmed by Paris. Everything
just gets better and better.

31:24.449 --> 31:29.053
If the Eiffel Tower was a penis
I'd let it come all over my face.

31:36.394 --> 31:37.895
For what?

31:45.803 --> 31:48.139
Charlotte's saying
that I never loved her.

31:48.206 --> 31:51.709
Charlotte that's like saying
water isn't wet. Course I did.

31:59.951 --> 32:01.185
I've had a mint night,

32:01.252 --> 32:04.589
we're back at the house
and the party's still going strong.

32:12.830 --> 32:15.133
Hold on, Holly,
are you flirting with me?

32:15.199 --> 32:18.369
Haven't we been down this road
before?

32:22.407 --> 32:26.678
Next thing I know, I feel myself
getting reeled in by Kyle,

32:26.744 --> 32:30.048
I'm going over the top of the
balcony. What the fuck is going on?

32:30.114 --> 32:32.150
I'm flailing around like a salmon.

32:33.151 --> 32:38.523
I don't know how I ended up here,
but it wasn't my intention.

32:38.589 --> 32:41.726
I am loving how hard how hard Kyle
is trying to get into me

32:41.793 --> 32:43.328
but I'm not gonna go there,

32:43.394 --> 32:47.231
I can't let myself be a mug,
I don't wanna get hurt.

32:53.037 --> 32:54.706
I know for a fact Holly wants us.

32:54.772 --> 32:58.309
She will give in eventually,
she can't resist us.

32:59.410 --> 33:02.780
It's been an amazing last night
in Paris, everyone's mortal,

33:02.847 --> 33:04.148
it's time to go to bed.

33:08.553 --> 33:11.489
Paris has been amazing
and I don't wanna leave

33:11.556 --> 33:15.159
because I don't wanna go back home
and face all of the problems.

33:15.226 --> 33:19.430
But I guess that's the only way
it's gonna get any easier.

33:22.800 --> 33:26.537
I've come back to the house
ready to face everyone. Hi, Marnie!

33:26.604 --> 33:30.108
I hope things don't kick off again.
I'm sorry for kissing Kyle.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.676
Wrapped around me finger.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.381
I need to leave
and try and get this sorted out.

33:36.447 --> 33:39.951
I just hope more than
anything that I can stay strong.

34:02.673 --> 34:05.176
(water running)

34:05.243 --> 34:08.478
(farting)

34:08.545 --> 34:10.181
Woops.

34:10.248 --> 34:14.284
I've woken up this morning and I'm
absolutely dying and I hear a noise

34:14.351 --> 34:17.021
and yeah, Charlotte's having a shit
above my head.

34:17.088 --> 34:19.456
I can't believe
it's our last day in Paris.

34:19.524 --> 34:23.494
I know. I don't wanna go home.
I don't, I've had such a good time.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.163
I don't, I have as well.

34:25.228 --> 34:29.400
Paris has been absolutely amazing, I
just wish I could stay here forever.

34:29.467 --> 34:33.603
How are you feeling about Mitch?
In Paris, I didn't think about it.

34:33.670 --> 34:36.107
It's like being on holiday, isn't it?

34:36.174 --> 34:38.676
And now it's
just all come flooding back.

34:38.743 --> 34:42.480
Vicky's asking about Mitch
and I don't even know what to say.

34:42.547 --> 34:43.681
Me head is fucked.

34:43.748 --> 34:47.150
As soon as I get back to Newcastle,
I need to sort this out.

35:00.932 --> 35:04.602
Paris has been absolutely amazing.
One of the best trips we've done.

35:04.669 --> 35:08.473
And the main reason probablys is
cos Marnie wasn't here to stir shit.

35:16.047 --> 35:19.016
Paris couldn't have come
at a better time.

35:19.083 --> 35:21.385
Everyone's got on
and I'm speaking to Kyle.

35:21.452 --> 35:24.322
Now I've just gotta sort things out
with Marnie.

35:28.426 --> 35:31.496
We're packing to go to Newcastle
and I don't wanna leave.

35:31.562 --> 35:34.899
I haven't experienced everything
what Paris has to offer.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.467
I didn't shag a French bird.

35:36.534 --> 35:38.703
Gotta go and grab
fucking Marnsworth.

35:38.769 --> 35:41.339
Think she'll be there?
Hopefully not.

35:41.405 --> 35:42.974
Back together as a family.

35:43.040 --> 35:47.378
And let's all try not to neck on
with each other's lasses right howa.

35:47.445 --> 35:51.282
We have had the best time in Paris,
it's been absolutely amazing.

35:51.349 --> 35:53.584
I'm gutted to be going back
to Newcastle.

36:07.265 --> 36:09.767
I've come back to the house
to face everyone.

36:09.834 --> 36:13.037
I feel so nervous cos I didn't
resolve anything when I left.

36:13.104 --> 36:14.438
But there's no one here.

36:19.243 --> 36:21.345
Paris has been absolutely amazing.

36:21.412 --> 36:25.216
We came with a bunch of issues but
I feel like everything's been solved.

36:25.283 --> 36:28.286
It's amazing what can happen
when Marnie's not here.

36:30.321 --> 36:32.623
Home sweet home!

36:32.690 --> 36:35.092
I hear everyone get back
and I'm so nervous.

36:35.159 --> 36:37.295
After the way I left things
at the party,

36:37.361 --> 36:40.197
I just don't know how it's gonna go.

36:40.264 --> 36:41.399
Hi, Marnie!

36:41.465 --> 36:43.801
We get back from Paris
and who's there?

36:43.868 --> 36:47.004
It's Marnie. Shit, I hope
things don't kick off again.

36:47.071 --> 36:48.839
Hi.
Hey, are you OK?

36:48.906 --> 36:49.941
Yeah, you?
Yeah.

36:50.007 --> 36:52.143
Hi, Marns. All hug at the same time.

36:52.209 --> 36:55.580
The girls are being so nice.
I don't even know why I was nervous,

36:55.646 --> 36:59.984
they actually look so happy
to see us back.

37:01.385 --> 37:02.420
What?

37:02.486 --> 37:05.623
I'm absolutely devastated
that I never got to go to Paris.

37:05.690 --> 37:07.825
But I would have ruined it for them.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.427
So, what did you do?

37:09.493 --> 37:12.330
Ate some snails, ate loads of bread.

37:12.396 --> 37:15.566
Went to see the Eiffel Tower.
We had a couple of good days.

37:15.633 --> 37:18.703
They're telling us about Paris
and it sounded amazing.

37:18.769 --> 37:21.439
Even though leaving was
the best thing at the time,

37:21.505 --> 37:22.807
I'm gutted I missed out.

37:22.873 --> 37:27.578
Sorry about the way I've acted.
You know I wasn't meself.

37:27.645 --> 37:30.281
Shall we leave them
to have a little chat?

37:30.348 --> 37:32.817
I know Marnie's not in everyone's
good books,

37:32.883 --> 37:34.986
but I've really missed her.

37:37.188 --> 37:40.091
I was a coward. Such a coward.
That's so bad of you.

37:40.157 --> 37:43.861
I need to say sorry to Kyle for
dragging him into my situation.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.463
I shouldn't of done that.

37:45.529 --> 37:47.865
I'm so sorry.
No, no it's fine, it's fine.

37:47.932 --> 37:50.768
I feel like it was my fault though.
It was both of we.

37:56.974 --> 38:00.044
By the sounds of it Kyle and Aaron
have sort of made up,

38:00.111 --> 38:02.446
but I'm worried
how he's gonna act with me.

38:02.513 --> 38:04.348
I didn't feel awkward to see you,

38:04.415 --> 38:07.218
I just thought we've known
each other long enough,

38:07.284 --> 38:09.487
you can understand
why that happened.

38:09.553 --> 38:12.490
That's sound, man.
It's absolutely sound, honestly.

38:12.556 --> 38:14.925
I'm glad to see you, me,
I missed you in Paris.

38:14.992 --> 38:18.496
I know, I'm devastated I missed it,
but it was the right thing.

38:18.562 --> 38:21.399
One more knock
and I would have fell over the edge.

38:21.465 --> 38:25.002
I just wanna say no matter what,
no matter about that the other night

38:25.069 --> 38:27.805
or anything else,
I've still got your back

38:27.872 --> 38:29.607
and I still love you to bits.

38:29.674 --> 38:33.144
Whatever happens, I love her
and I'll always be there for her.

38:47.558 --> 38:49.326
I'm still thinking about Mitch.

38:49.393 --> 38:53.330
I can't go on any longer
thinking about this every day

38:53.397 --> 38:55.466
and speaking about it
to everyone else

38:55.533 --> 38:58.469
but not letting him know
about the situation.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.542
I need to leave,
I need to speak to Mitch

39:04.608 --> 39:06.444
and try and get this sorted out.

39:12.249 --> 39:14.185
The girls are helping us make a list

39:14.251 --> 39:16.854
of issues
in mine and Mitch's relationship,

39:16.921 --> 39:19.490
so I can try and sort out
what I wanna say to him.

39:22.827 --> 39:26.063
Now we're back, I need to speak
to Marnie, but I'm nervous.

39:26.130 --> 39:29.200
She's definitely got a hold over me.

39:29.266 --> 39:32.269
You all right?
Yeah, you? How do you feel?

39:33.804 --> 39:34.805
I dunno.

39:39.877 --> 39:41.746
It took a lot
for me to come back in.

39:41.812 --> 39:44.482
I felt so nervous,
how I left things.

39:44.548 --> 39:48.586
I'm so pleased Aaron told us he felt
nervous about seeing me as well,

39:48.652 --> 39:51.822
it means we're both on the same page
and if we're both nervous

39:51.889 --> 39:53.824
there's obviously feelings there.

40:00.064 --> 40:05.169
Yeah, because you invited that girl,
I didn't get to go to Paris.

40:11.976 --> 40:13.677
I'm sorry for kissing Kyle.

40:13.744 --> 40:17.782
I needed to hear Marnie apologise
cos she was just as much to blame.

40:17.848 --> 40:20.951
I've made her jealous
and she wanted to get us back.

40:30.027 --> 40:32.797
I'm so pleased
Aaron's taken some responsibility

40:32.863 --> 40:34.532
for what happened at the party

40:34.598 --> 40:36.967
and he understands
why I done what I done.

40:39.036 --> 40:40.070
Yeah.

40:47.478 --> 40:48.546
Is it?

40:48.612 --> 40:51.615
I've been back an hour
and Marnie's massaging me neck.

40:51.682 --> 40:54.351
She's wrapped around
me little finger.

40:54.985 --> 40:57.688
I don't feel secure
in me relationship.

40:57.755 --> 41:01.458
I'm just waiting for the next day
that he's gonna finish us. Right.

41:01.525 --> 41:04.328
Right now Charlotte's head's
all over the place

41:04.395 --> 41:08.899
and this list is gonna help her
focus her thoughts.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.802
So far we have, used to
make her feel really happy,

41:11.869 --> 41:14.939
but now the negatives
are outweighing the positives

41:15.005 --> 41:17.007
and he's starting to
make her feel sad.

41:17.074 --> 41:20.344
There's a lot of problems
that need to be solved

41:20.411 --> 41:23.948
and even though I've got them all
written down on me pieces of paper,

41:24.014 --> 41:25.983
I am fucking shitting meself.

41:26.050 --> 41:28.485
Why wouldn't Mitch wanna be with ya?

41:28.552 --> 41:32.056
You're beautiful
and you're lovely to be around

41:32.122 --> 41:34.658
and you're a nice person.

41:34.725 --> 41:35.726
(sniffs)

41:35.793 --> 41:38.229
I'm so scared because I'm so weak

41:38.295 --> 41:42.333
and I've been so weak with him
for so long because I love him.

41:42.399 --> 41:44.802
I don't wanna have
a life without him,

41:44.869 --> 41:47.104
but I can't keep on going this way.

41:51.108 --> 41:53.944
What if I forget the list?
I've wrote it down.

41:54.011 --> 41:58.015
It's gonna look like a freak
if I walk in with paper.

42:00.651 --> 42:04.288
I've done it quite big writing
as well so you can read it.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.857
And I've not used many words
over five letters.

42:06.924 --> 42:10.761
Right now I don't know whether I'm
gonna come back to this house single

42:10.828 --> 42:13.764
or in a relationship,
I'm just so confused.

42:13.831 --> 42:19.637
I feel like I need to go
and I need to just sort it out.

42:19.703 --> 42:24.008
So either things change or you
fucking have some time off,

42:24.074 --> 42:27.845
or just say I want time to think.
That's what I'm gonna go in with.

42:27.912 --> 42:32.383
I do really appreciate all of Gary's
support, but I can't help but feel

42:32.449 --> 42:36.787
so bad thinking, "Should I even be
talking about this to you?"

42:36.854 --> 42:38.889
Is this the right thing to be doing?

42:40.691 --> 42:44.962
You'll be fine. I'll speak to you
when you get back. Yeah.

42:45.029 --> 42:48.265
The next few days are gonna be tough,
but I'll be here for her

42:48.332 --> 42:50.834
and so will her Geordie Shore family.

42:54.571 --> 42:55.806
See you later.

42:57.841 --> 43:00.611
I'm leaving the house
and I'm going to speak to Mitch

43:00.678 --> 43:04.848
and I just hope more than anything
that I can stay strong.

43:11.522 --> 43:13.390
This is gonna be a messy night.

43:15.960 --> 43:19.863
If looks could kill, Marnie and
Scott would be six feet under.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.166
Why should I clean everyone's filth?

43:22.232 --> 43:24.668
Vicky's taking this boss role
way too far.

43:24.735 --> 43:28.272
Why should I clean that shithole up?
Because you're not a princess!

43:30.174 --> 43:35.112
Me and Gary are brushing each
other's teeth. This is so romantic.
