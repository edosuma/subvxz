00:26.762 --> 00:28.399
- Rusty, pick up, come on.

00:31.404 --> 00:33.437
- Hi, did you get him?

00:33.472 --> 00:34.438
- No, no, not yet.

00:34.473 --> 00:36.737
He's about 500 yards up.

00:36.772 --> 00:38.409
This time, we're gonna get him.

00:38.444 --> 00:40.444
You gotta meet me at
spit fork right now.

00:40.479 --> 00:43.216
- I'm so happy, I
could just kiss you!

00:44.681 --> 00:45.845
- Now that's just wrong.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.187
- Why?

00:47.222 --> 00:48.254
- Because you're my sister.

00:48.289 --> 00:49.585
- Oops, keep forgettin'.

00:49.620 --> 00:50.586
- Yeah, just get on with it.

00:50.621 --> 00:52.357
Meet me up there.

01:13.512 --> 01:14.841
- I'm so excited!

01:26.822 --> 01:28.459
I thought you were Bigfoot!

01:28.494 --> 01:31.528
- Quit you're talking,
he's right over there.

01:31.563 --> 01:32.496
- Where?

01:32.531 --> 01:33.926
- Shh.

01:33.961 --> 01:34.894
Go, go, go.

01:36.403 --> 01:37.270
Get going.

01:45.445 --> 01:46.840
- He's not here!

01:46.875 --> 01:48.545
- What do you
mean he's not there?

01:48.580 --> 01:49.678
- He got away.

01:49.713 --> 01:52.186
- Oh, no, he got away.

01:52.221 --> 01:53.847
Well, you know what?

01:53.882 --> 01:56.784
Next time we're gonna give
him the red carpet treatment.

01:58.392 --> 02:01.921
- The red carpet
treatment?

02:01.956 --> 02:06.497
I'm ready for my
closeup!

02:06.532 --> 02:08.202
Now find him!

02:08.237 --> 02:09.467
- Get going.

06:01.932 --> 06:03.965
- Hi, Dr. Dawn.
- How are you?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.165
- I'm doing great, how are you?

06:06.200 --> 06:08.068
- Listen, there's been
a bunch of Bigfoot

06:08.103 --> 06:09.872
sightings in the area.

06:09.907 --> 06:11.511
I'm so excited.

06:11.546 --> 06:14.646
And I really think that
he's close this time.

06:14.681 --> 06:17.781
So I've been talking to some
of the girls from the team,

06:17.816 --> 06:19.981
and I thought what we'd do
is we'd get together again.

06:20.016 --> 06:22.720
I really think this
time we might find him.

06:22.755 --> 06:26.658
- Oh my God, I just
had the craziest dream.

06:26.693 --> 06:30.596
I dreamt Bigfoot was stalking
me, and there he was.

06:30.631 --> 06:32.125
- That's kind of an omen.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.797
- I think it is.

06:33.832 --> 06:34.930
- So the girls are
all getting ready

06:34.965 --> 06:36.800
to come tomorrow morning.

06:36.835 --> 06:39.132
I've also got an ad on
Craigslist for a new girl.

06:39.167 --> 06:41.640
So we'll meet here
tomorrow, nine o'clock?

06:41.675 --> 06:43.202
- Okay, that's perfect.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.478
See you then.

06:44.513 --> 06:45.171
- Bye.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.482
- Pull!

06:50.079 --> 06:51.045
Pull!

06:52.917 --> 06:53.817
Pull!

06:54.952 --> 06:56.116
Pull!

06:57.724 --> 06:58.558
Pull!

07:01.288 --> 07:02.221
Pull!

07:03.796 --> 07:04.795
Pull!

07:06.161 --> 07:07.567
Pull!

07:09.736 --> 07:11.032
- You never miss.

07:15.038 --> 07:17.808
Whoa, whoa, easy,
easy.

07:17.843 --> 07:18.743
Don't shoot.

07:19.812 --> 07:21.207
- What are you doing here?

07:21.242 --> 07:22.846
- Just though I'd
check on my sis.

07:22.881 --> 07:23.880
- Yeah, well, I'm
doing just fine.

07:23.915 --> 07:25.849
You can go now.

07:25.884 --> 07:28.016
- Mm, yeah, you seem real fine.

07:29.855 --> 07:31.184
God, you're still so angry.

07:32.759 --> 07:34.220
I mean, Jess, it's
been five years.

07:34.255 --> 07:36.156
When are you gonna let this go?

07:36.191 --> 07:38.290
- When are you gonna give a
shit that our father's dead?

07:38.325 --> 07:42.030
- You don't think that this
kills me every single day, huh?

07:42.065 --> 07:43.867
It was a horrible accident.

07:43.902 --> 07:45.704
He was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

07:45.739 --> 07:50.709
- It was about a bunch of
greedy hunters out for Bigfoot.

07:51.646 --> 07:53.008
And again, he got away.

07:53.043 --> 07:55.681
And our father lost
his life because of it.

07:55.716 --> 07:57.045
And it's gonna happen
to somebody else

07:57.080 --> 07:59.850
unless this damn
beast is caught.

08:04.186 --> 08:08.122
- All right, why
don't you get him?

08:08.157 --> 08:09.695
- What?

08:09.730 --> 08:11.158
- Come on, Jess.

08:11.193 --> 08:13.028
You're the best shot in
this neck of the woods.

08:13.063 --> 08:15.063
If anyone could hunt
him down, it's you.

08:16.671 --> 08:17.538
Do it.

08:19.234 --> 08:20.200
Do it for dad.

08:24.943 --> 08:28.307
- I love you, Billy.
- Love you too, kiddo.

08:30.179 --> 08:32.652
Now, gear up and go get him.

- Hi, Tilly.

10:12.050 --> 10:13.148
- You look great.

10:13.183 --> 10:14.314
- And this is, Daisy.

10:14.349 --> 10:15.788
- Hi!

10:15.823 --> 10:17.251
I'm Daisy May.

10:17.286 --> 10:19.418
- She answered the
add in Craigslist,

10:19.453 --> 10:21.255
and I thought she was perfect.

10:21.290 --> 10:22.960
So Daisy's not done this before,

10:22.995 --> 10:24.423
so we're gonna teach her.

10:24.458 --> 10:27.965
- This is my first
time, first time.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.329
- And then, Tilly, you're
gonna be showing her

10:29.364 --> 10:30.198
how to do the
sword and the toys.

10:30.233 --> 10:31.936
- Yes, I am.

10:31.971 --> 10:33.267
- Yeah.
- Oh.

10:33.302 --> 10:35.137
Yeah.

10:35.172 --> 10:36.435
- And Penny, you're gonna
be showing her how we

10:36.470 --> 10:37.843
use our sensuality to--
- To be sexy.

10:37.878 --> 10:40.307
- Oh, I heard he likes booties.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.410
And I heard Bigfoot
likes big titties.

10:45.314 --> 10:46.280
Right?

10:47.448 --> 10:49.019
- So we're gonna seduce him out,

10:49.054 --> 10:50.955
but this time we're
gonna find him.

10:50.990 --> 10:53.188
And I even heard that
they've had these wolf calls,

10:53.223 --> 10:54.728
like woo, hoo, hoo!

10:54.763 --> 10:57.225
You know, the Bigfoot
making noises.

10:57.260 --> 11:00.096
- But like is the local
news gonna be here?

11:00.131 --> 11:01.493
Is like CNN?

11:01.528 --> 11:04.133
- Oh, when we get
selfies with Bigfoot,

11:04.168 --> 11:06.069
and then when we
actually interview him,

11:06.104 --> 11:07.906
oh, we're gonna
have so much press.

11:07.941 --> 11:09.743
- But like how long do
you think it's gonna be

11:09.778 --> 11:11.107
before we get famous?

11:11.142 --> 11:12.438
- Oh, right away.

11:12.473 --> 11:13.780
- Yeah, it's instant.
- Right away.

11:13.815 --> 11:15.243
- Then I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

11:15.278 --> 11:16.948
- So do you guys have
outfits for the hunt?

11:16.983 --> 11:18.752
- I do, I do, I do.

11:18.787 --> 11:20.116
- Yeah, sexy stuff?

11:20.151 --> 11:21.249
Okay, let's change.
- Let's do it.

11:21.284 --> 11:22.250
- Okay.
- Let's go.

11:28.489 --> 11:31.193
- Hi, my name is Penny Blossom,

11:31.228 --> 11:33.525
and I'm an internet influencer.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.396
I have a lot of
people following me,

11:36.431 --> 11:40.136
and I have sponsors that pay
me money because they like me.

11:40.171 --> 11:42.006
They think I'm cute.

11:42.041 --> 11:44.778
But the main reason is I
get visited from celebrities

11:44.813 --> 11:47.407
that have passed away
and they come and see me

11:47.442 --> 11:49.244
because they tell
me I'm special.

11:50.885 --> 11:53.347
- Hi, I'm Dr. Dawn.

11:55.186 --> 11:57.483
This is gonna be my third
expedition to find Bigfoot.

11:57.518 --> 12:01.223
And this time we're
gonna find him.

12:01.258 --> 12:03.093
I'm so excited.

12:03.128 --> 12:05.194
I've actually been an
enthusiastic about Bigfoot

12:05.229 --> 12:07.559
since I was a little
girl in England,

12:07.594 --> 12:10.397
and I was part of
the Girl Guides.

12:10.432 --> 12:12.333
Girl Scouts over here,
but that, you know,

12:12.368 --> 12:14.203
we're more hardcore in England.

12:15.107 --> 12:16.876
- I'm Daisy May.

12:16.911 --> 12:19.846
I'm a stripper by trade,

12:19.881 --> 12:22.442
but I'm trying to
make a career change

12:22.477 --> 12:26.215
and become a successful
famous person.

12:26.250 --> 12:30.120
So what happened was
I'm at my strip club,

12:30.155 --> 12:32.452
and I'm talking to
one of my regulars.

12:32.487 --> 12:37.490
And his friend comes in and
says, "Guess what, Charlie?"

12:38.427 --> 12:40.295
That's my regular.

12:40.330 --> 12:43.397
"There is a Bigfoot out in
the woods on the loose."

12:43.432 --> 12:46.334
- My name is Tilly Takahashi.

12:46.369 --> 12:49.040
I'm half-German
and half-Japanese.

12:49.075 --> 12:52.043
My mother was German,
and she named me Tilly

12:52.078 --> 12:54.309
because I have
bravery and strength.

12:54.344 --> 12:58.115
And my father gave me his
sword on his deathbed.

12:58.150 --> 13:01.514
So I travel with
it wherever I go.

13:01.549 --> 13:04.220
Even in the forest, even
when I'm on the bathroom.

13:04.255 --> 13:06.123
You know why?

13:06.158 --> 13:08.323
Because Bigfoot can sneak
up on you in the forest.

13:08.358 --> 13:10.897
Even when you're
popping a squat!

13:10.932 --> 13:15.935
- Ahoy maties, I'm Jesse
James from Bigfoot or Bust.

13:17.598 --> 13:20.005
And I have a plan to come
back and prove to everyone

13:20.040 --> 13:24.108
that Bigfoot exists and
bring him back alive.

13:25.210 --> 13:26.209
But in my care.

13:27.278 --> 13:29.410
I have a way of taming beasts.

13:29.445 --> 13:31.643
- Hi, I'm Rusty Ready.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.216
I'm Wally's sister.

13:33.251 --> 13:34.954
Well, I used to think
we were cousins,

13:34.989 --> 13:37.385
but I found out he's my brother,

13:37.420 --> 13:40.058
which is so strange because
also there's a rumor

13:40.093 --> 13:42.555
in our family that we're
related to Bigfoot.

13:42.590 --> 13:45.459
And it's been my dream since I
was a little, little, little,

13:45.494 --> 13:50.464
little, little girl to capture
Bigfoot, and I'm gon do it.

13:52.072 --> 13:55.975
If I have to entice him
any way I can.

13:57.638 --> 14:01.310
- Hi, I'm Wally, and I am a
lean, mean killing machine.

14:01.345 --> 14:03.147
- Lean?

14:03.182 --> 14:04.643
- I even got firepower
because the number one thing

14:04.678 --> 14:08.449
that's on my plate
right now is Bigfoot.

14:08.484 --> 14:10.253
He's mine.

14:10.288 --> 14:13.157
I'm gonna get very large
amounts of money for that thing.

14:13.192 --> 14:15.159
Big smelly turd.

14:15.194 --> 14:18.195
By the way, these are my horses.

14:20.496 --> 14:22.067
This is my farm.

14:22.102 --> 14:24.003
You go on my website
anytime you want

14:24.038 --> 14:28.502
because I can teach you how
to ride one of them horses.

14:33.575 --> 14:36.279
- Okay, ladies, are we locked
and loaded and ready to go?

14:36.314 --> 14:37.313
- Yes, we are.

14:37.348 --> 14:39.414
I got my crossbow.

14:39.449 --> 14:40.679
- Ready to shoot.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.351
- Woo!
- My darts.

14:42.386 --> 14:44.617
- Now, Daisy, I have
an instrument here.

14:44.652 --> 14:46.322
- Okay.
- I'm gonna give you this.

14:46.357 --> 14:49.028
This is a tranquilizer
gun, right?

14:49.063 --> 14:51.261
Just 'cause it's your
first time and everything.

14:51.296 --> 14:52.625
- What does it do?

14:52.660 --> 14:54.231
- If he gets close,
you're gonna,

14:54.266 --> 14:55.397
you're gonna shoot him with it.

14:55.432 --> 14:57.003
- Okay, okay, where?

14:57.038 --> 14:58.598
In the butt, right, in the butt?

14:58.633 --> 14:59.467
- I say in the butt.
- In the butt, in the butt?

14:59.502 --> 15:01.106
- Oh no, no.

15:01.141 --> 15:02.272
We need to shoot
him in the balls.

15:02.307 --> 15:03.977
- In the balls?
- Ooh, nasty!

15:04.012 --> 15:05.704
- I mean, if he's
not cooperating.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.376
- Like that!
- Yeah, exactly.

15:07.411 --> 15:09.983
- And so you know the
one action where you.

15:10.018 --> 15:11.149
- Okay.
- Yeah, there you go.

15:11.184 --> 15:12.216
There you go.
- Like that!

15:12.251 --> 15:13.448
- Right.
- And then that.

15:13.483 --> 15:15.384
- And also Penny will cover you.

15:15.419 --> 15:18.420
Hopefully you won't shoot
one of us, but if you do.

15:18.455 --> 15:20.356
- I have Narcan in my backpack.

15:20.391 --> 15:21.753
- Oh, well that would help.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.755
- Okay, but if I shoot
him in the balls,

15:23.790 --> 15:25.757
how are we gonna do
a good interview?

15:25.792 --> 15:27.429
I thought you said
there's gonna be

15:27.464 --> 15:29.695
like news crews from
all over the world.

15:29.730 --> 15:33.039
- We'll do the selfies first,
and if he's not cooperating,

15:33.074 --> 15:34.436
then you shoot him in the balls.

15:34.471 --> 15:36.042
- I don't think this--
- We'll tell you.

15:36.077 --> 15:37.076
We'll tell you when
to do it, yeah.

15:37.111 --> 15:38.308
Right, are we ready?

15:38.343 --> 15:39.672
- Yeah.
- Are we ready to go?

15:39.707 --> 15:41.476
- Yes.
- Yeah, let's do it ladies!

15:41.511 --> 15:42.741
Let's go!

- Yeah, what's up, Jess?

16:50.118 --> 16:52.151
- Billy, you're not gonna
believe what just happened.

16:52.186 --> 16:57.156
I'm driving my Jeep, and
Bigfoot just ran across the road

16:58.258 --> 16:59.356
right in front of my Jeep.

16:59.391 --> 17:01.226
- Did you shoot him?

17:01.261 --> 17:04.460
- I got out, I ran with my
gun, but I couldn't catch him.

17:04.495 --> 17:05.659
But can you believe that?

17:05.694 --> 17:07.760
- All right, look, be careful,

17:07.795 --> 17:10.136
regroup and take
care of business.

17:10.171 --> 17:12.534
- I'll get him, don't you worry.

17:12.569 --> 17:15.207
All right, keep you posted, bye.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.148
- Is everyone all right?

17:22.183 --> 17:22.808
- Yes.
- Yes.

17:22.843 --> 17:24.084
- Okay, good.

17:25.516 --> 17:27.120
What year is it?

17:27.155 --> 17:28.253
- 2022.

17:28.288 --> 17:29.716
- Well, at least it's not 2020.

17:31.489 --> 17:32.686
Where is Bigfoot?

17:32.721 --> 17:33.819
- We're gonna find out.

17:36.593 --> 17:38.164
I see him.

17:38.199 --> 17:38.857
- Let's go that way.

17:38.892 --> 17:39.726
- Yep.
- Yeah.

17:39.761 --> 17:40.393
- Let's go.

17:41.664 --> 17:43.301
- Where'd you last see Bigfoot?

17:43.336 --> 17:44.830
- Well, last time
he got really close,

17:44.865 --> 17:46.271
but we were watching
for the droppings.

17:46.306 --> 17:48.405
We were looking on the ground

17:48.440 --> 17:50.605
to see if we could
see any, any...

17:50.640 --> 17:52.277
- You mean the poop?

17:52.312 --> 17:53.575
- Wait, wait, hold
it, hold it, guys.

17:53.610 --> 17:55.445
This thing is so heavy.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.447
I just don't know what to
do, I can't carry it anymore.

17:57.482 --> 17:58.910
- Yeah, me too, this
is really heavy.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.582
- Okay, come on, girls.

18:00.617 --> 18:03.453
Use your brain, put
it in your backpack.

18:23.772 --> 18:26.443
- Hey there, sweetheart.

18:26.478 --> 18:30.612
First I got your daddy,
and now I got his kin.

18:37.753 --> 18:41.326
Adios, doll.

19:02.646 --> 19:04.745
- Oh my God, did you
bitches just hear that?

19:04.780 --> 19:07.286
- That's Bigfoot,
it's gotta be Bigfoot!

19:07.321 --> 19:09.849
- That has to be something,
that was really big.

19:09.884 --> 19:11.587
- Yes, let's get him!

19:11.622 --> 19:13.919
- Come on, girls, let's go!
- Let's do this.

19:13.954 --> 19:15.591
- Oh my God, are you sure?

19:15.626 --> 19:17.791
Okay, I guess I really
wanna get famous.

19:21.566 --> 19:22.532
- What is that?

19:24.998 --> 19:26.239
- Someone's hurt!

19:26.274 --> 19:26.899
- Oh!

19:26.934 --> 19:27.900
Oh!

19:27.935 --> 19:29.902
- Oh my God, you guys.

19:29.937 --> 19:31.442
Is she dead?

19:31.477 --> 19:32.575
Is she dead?

19:32.610 --> 19:34.610
- Dr. Dawn, you're a doctor.

19:34.645 --> 19:35.908
Is she dead?
- It's Jesse.

19:38.286 --> 19:39.681
- Well, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

19:39.716 --> 19:40.682
You're a doctor,
you can help her.

19:40.717 --> 19:41.881
- You're a doctor?

19:41.916 --> 19:42.882
She's a doctor.
- Are you okay?

19:42.917 --> 19:44.521
- Yeah, she is a doctor.

19:44.556 --> 19:46.457
- Well, I'm not that
kind of a doctor.

19:46.492 --> 19:47.326
- Oh!

19:47.361 --> 19:48.624
She's alive.

19:48.659 --> 19:49.790
She's alive.
- What, are you okay?

19:49.825 --> 19:51.495
Are you okay?
- Oh my God.

19:51.530 --> 19:52.859
- You've broken something?
- You okay?

19:52.894 --> 19:54.432
You need help.
- No, no, I'm good.

19:54.467 --> 19:55.433
I'm good.

19:55.468 --> 19:56.863
- You guys, she's alive.

19:56.898 --> 19:58.733
- Jesse, what are
you doing here?

19:58.768 --> 20:00.306
- Holy cow.

20:00.341 --> 20:04.409
Some freaking, whatever
the hell that was.

20:04.444 --> 20:05.311
- Bigfoot!

20:08.877 --> 20:10.547
- Are you guys looking
for Bigfoot too?

20:10.582 --> 20:11.977
- Yes.
- Yeah.

20:12.012 --> 20:13.385
- Oh my God.
- Are you looking for Bigfoot?

20:13.420 --> 20:14.584
- Yes.

20:14.619 --> 20:15.717
Yes.
- Did you find him?

20:15.752 --> 20:17.785
- He snuck up on me.

20:17.820 --> 20:19.457
- Bigfoot threw
you off the bridge?

20:19.492 --> 20:20.887
- Was he stinky?
- I think so.

20:20.922 --> 20:22.625
- Oh my God, you're
so lucky to be alive.

20:22.660 --> 20:23.923
- I know.

20:23.958 --> 20:25.595
- I know.
- You were so close.

20:25.630 --> 20:27.432
Did you feel him,
did you smell him?

20:27.467 --> 20:29.302
- I, I, I could...

20:29.337 --> 20:31.370
I could sense that he was
there or something was there.

20:31.405 --> 20:32.800
And then I just saw his.

20:32.835 --> 20:35.869
- I'm amazed, there's
not even any blood.

20:35.904 --> 20:37.508
- Here, help her
up, help her up.

20:37.543 --> 20:38.003
- We were right, okay.
- Can you stand up?

20:40.348 --> 20:41.776
- Oh, I'm fine.

20:41.811 --> 20:44.482
I'm good, I'm good.
- You wanna join us?

20:44.517 --> 20:46.616
- I mean, really?

20:46.651 --> 20:48.486
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Yeah.

20:48.521 --> 20:50.521
- I think that
would be fricking awesome.

20:50.556 --> 20:52.754
- Woo!
- Yay, honey!

20:52.789 --> 20:54.624
- There's not a scratch on you.

20:54.659 --> 20:55.757
- All right, guys.

20:55.792 --> 20:57.088
- Let's go.
- Come on, yeah.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.958
- This a-way.
- Okay.

20:58.993 --> 21:01.026
- And stay clear of that
bridge, for the love of God.

21:01.061 --> 21:03.699
- There's not a
scratch on you, bitch.

21:03.734 --> 21:06.372
And you still look good.

21:13.711 --> 21:16.349
- He's gotta be out
there somewhere.

21:16.384 --> 21:19.484
- You know, I think it's
time for Bigfoot calling.

21:19.519 --> 21:22.080
- Yeah, Tarzan style.

21:22.115 --> 21:22.949
- Oh.

21:27.021 --> 21:28.086
- Is it working?

21:28.990 --> 21:30.561
- Bigfoot!

21:30.596 --> 21:32.431
- Let's try Jane style.

21:32.466 --> 21:33.432
- What's Jane style?

21:33.467 --> 21:34.433
- Like.

21:35.062 --> 21:36.028
- Oh.

21:37.064 --> 21:38.030
- Like a girlie one.

21:40.804 --> 21:41.869
Is he coming?

21:41.904 --> 21:43.002
No.

21:43.037 --> 21:45.004
Let's try ape style, like.

21:45.039 --> 21:46.610
- Oh, okay.

21:50.616 --> 21:51.549
- Yeah, put with it.

21:53.883 --> 21:55.080
Like put it in.

21:58.426 --> 22:00.789
- Maybe we need to
try something else.

22:00.824 --> 22:01.757
- Try this one.

22:04.927 --> 22:06.157
- Okay.

22:07.864 --> 22:09.864
- No, no, you need to be
louder than that, Penny.

22:09.899 --> 22:10.997
Like this.

22:12.572 --> 22:13.868
- Okay, let me try.

22:16.444 --> 22:17.938
- No, no, like this one.

22:19.777 --> 22:20.644
- Okay.

22:27.048 --> 22:28.784
- Okay, that has gotta do it.

22:28.819 --> 22:30.588
- That has to do it.

22:30.623 --> 22:31.589
Do you see him yet?

22:32.592 --> 22:33.624
- No.

22:35.122 --> 22:37.826
We need some like
real sound system.

22:37.861 --> 22:41.060
- Yeah, maybe we can try and
find a real sound system,

22:41.095 --> 22:42.094
and that would work.
- Yeah.

22:42.129 --> 22:43.766
- I bet that would work.

22:43.801 --> 22:44.866
- There's gotta be one
round here somewhere.

22:44.901 --> 22:45.768
- Yeah.

22:47.673 --> 22:48.936
- Do you think he's close?

22:48.971 --> 22:50.641
- I think I smell him.

22:50.676 --> 22:51.543
- Yeah.

22:52.909 --> 22:55.481
We are real close,
I smell him too.

22:55.516 --> 22:56.878
All right, team.

22:56.913 --> 22:58.682
We need to remember
why we are here.

22:58.717 --> 22:59.683
- But why are we here?

22:59.718 --> 23:00.849
- Yeah, why are we here?

23:02.589 --> 23:04.787
- To get Bigfoot's droppings.

23:06.120 --> 23:08.527
- You mean we're here
looking for shit?

23:09.596 --> 23:10.958
- Yeah.

23:10.993 --> 23:13.994
No, I mean, for
medicinal purposes,

23:14.029 --> 23:16.601
we need his droppings.

23:16.636 --> 23:18.229
Team.

23:18.264 --> 23:22.772
In 2050, Bigfoot droppings
are worth trillions

23:22.807 --> 23:24.675
and trillions.
- Wow.

23:24.710 --> 23:29.548
- All we need is just two or
three of those big babies,

23:30.617 --> 23:31.242
and we'll be trillionaires.

23:32.619 --> 23:35.147
- That is great, oh my God!

23:35.182 --> 23:36.918
- Get it together, let's go.

23:37.855 --> 23:39.525
- Droppings, shit.

23:41.661 --> 23:44.024
- This is gonna be the third
time that I've done this.

23:44.059 --> 23:46.191
The call me Dr. Dawn
because I'm a doctor.

23:46.226 --> 23:50.536
I have a PhD from Oxford
in chemical engineering.

23:50.571 --> 23:54.100
Actually it was a little,
little college down the road

23:54.135 --> 23:55.772
from the regular Oxford.

23:55.807 --> 23:58.137
And it's actually in
paranormal science.

23:58.172 --> 24:00.546
But you know, I don't
tell the girls that.

24:00.581 --> 24:03.043
I'm a little on the edge,
and I'm not sure that,

24:03.078 --> 24:05.650
you know, they all
really appreciate that.

24:05.685 --> 24:08.081
- I had an Elvis sighting,

24:08.116 --> 24:09.720
and he asked me
if he can help me.

24:09.755 --> 24:12.283
And I go, "Yeah, sure.

24:12.318 --> 24:13.922
"But you're not really
Elvis, are you?"

24:13.957 --> 24:15.792
He goes, "No, I'm Elvis.

24:15.827 --> 24:17.860
"No one can see me, but
you because you're special.

24:17.895 --> 24:20.060
"And I'm making an appearance."

24:20.095 --> 24:22.260
I said, "Can I get a selfie?"

24:22.295 --> 24:25.131
So I took a selfie, and
I turned around to finish

24:25.166 --> 24:28.299
putting the gas on, he just
disappeared into thin air.

24:28.334 --> 24:31.170
- And this particular Bigfoot is

24:31.205 --> 24:35.515
really attracted to white
girls with big booties.

24:36.716 --> 24:38.144
Like mine.

24:38.179 --> 24:40.311
- You might wonder why I
joined this expedition.

24:40.346 --> 24:42.852
Well, I felt like the
girls could use my help

24:42.887 --> 24:45.151
because I have sword skills!

24:45.186 --> 24:47.758
I think I'm very strong.

24:47.793 --> 24:50.123
And I don't think Bigfoot
is gonna stand a chance

24:50.158 --> 24:53.060
against me, even though
I'm much smaller than him.

24:53.095 --> 24:55.964
It doesn't matter,
I've got brains too.

24:55.999 --> 24:57.801
And he's just a big oaf.

24:57.836 --> 25:00.166
What is he doing wandering
around the forest all the time?

25:05.371 --> 25:06.337
- Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:06.372 --> 25:07.580
Look, look, look.

25:08.649 --> 25:09.747
- Is that an animal?

25:09.782 --> 25:11.243
- It's a clue, it looks...

25:11.278 --> 25:13.080
- Oh my God.
- Oh no, it looks like.

25:13.115 --> 25:16.721
- It stinks.
- What is that stench?

25:16.756 --> 25:18.085
Ew!

25:18.120 --> 25:19.658
Ew, ew, ew.
- It smells.

25:19.693 --> 25:21.187
- Ew, ew, ew.

25:21.222 --> 25:23.354
- Does it smell like him?
- What is it?

25:23.389 --> 25:25.224
- Oh.
- I don't wanna smell it.

25:25.259 --> 25:27.963
I can smell it from here,
don't get closer, no!

25:27.998 --> 25:29.195
- You can see the skin
underneath if you look.

25:29.230 --> 25:30.801
- Oh no, it's fresh.

25:30.836 --> 25:32.264
- It came from his butt?

25:32.299 --> 25:34.607
- Well, this looks like
where the legs would be.

25:34.642 --> 25:36.708
- Maybe he's hurt.
- Yeah, maybe he's hurt.

25:36.743 --> 25:38.138
Maybe somebody cut him.

25:38.173 --> 25:39.337
- Well, he hurt
me, good for him.

25:39.372 --> 25:40.910
- So wait a second.

25:40.945 --> 25:42.879
Does this mean
we're one more step

25:42.914 --> 25:45.244
closer to finding Bigfoot?

25:45.279 --> 25:47.279
So we're one step closer
to getting famous?

25:47.314 --> 25:49.215
- No, I think what
happened was he--

25:49.250 --> 25:50.755
- Oh my God, I'm so excited.

25:50.790 --> 25:52.218
- He's gotta be close.

25:52.253 --> 25:54.088
- Okay, let's go find him.
- Yeah.

25:54.123 --> 25:56.156
- Okay, find him.
- This is my moment.

25:56.191 --> 25:57.322
I'm getting famous.

25:58.391 --> 25:59.225
I'm brave.

25:59.260 --> 26:00.127
Here we go!

26:02.967 --> 26:04.131
- Oh my God.

26:13.912 --> 26:14.779
Oh my God.

26:16.310 --> 26:20.312
Guys, unless that's a
mirage, that is a trampoline!

26:20.347 --> 26:22.116
- A what?
- Trampoline.

26:22.151 --> 26:24.118
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

26:24.153 --> 26:26.758
- Just like that?
- Let's go check it out!

26:29.158 --> 26:31.224
- Let's go jump on it!

26:32.733 --> 26:34.700
Trampoline!
- God, freaking awesome.

26:34.735 --> 26:37.263
- Oh my God, I love trampolines.

26:38.299 --> 26:39.903
Oh, I am so excited!

26:41.302 --> 26:44.039
I love trampolines.
- Who's gonna go first?

26:44.074 --> 26:46.008
- Me, me, me, me, me,
me, me, I'm always last.

26:46.043 --> 26:47.141
I'm going first.

26:47.176 --> 26:48.747
No, I'm always fucking last.

26:48.782 --> 26:49.880
I'm going first,

actually scientific evidence

26:53.149 --> 26:56.722
that squeaky springs are
gonna excite Bigfoot?

26:56.757 --> 26:58.416
- Really?
- Wow.

26:58.451 --> 27:01.320
- So if we jump really high,
we could get him all excited,

27:01.355 --> 27:02.992
and he could come down to us.

27:03.027 --> 27:06.930
- I'm really good at
making beds squeak.

27:06.965 --> 27:08.932
So let me see what I can do.

27:08.967 --> 27:10.835

You know, Sox went down.

34:48.459 --> 34:50.327
Henry's Burger Grill closed.

34:50.362 --> 34:52.560
They just shot the final
season of Schitt's Creek,

34:52.595 --> 34:53.660
which sucks.

34:53.695 --> 34:55.662
Which really sucks.

34:55.697 --> 35:00.304
Although it kind of feels
like we are in Schitt's Creek.

35:00.339 --> 35:04.902
But that red M&M, I'm so
excited they bought back.

35:04.937 --> 35:08.444
They're making it by the
bag full, and that's good.

35:08.479 --> 35:10.479
- Jesse, I'm being serious.

35:10.514 --> 35:11.777
You took quite a fall.

35:11.812 --> 35:13.779
Are you okay?

35:13.814 --> 35:14.714
- Yeah, I'm good.

35:14.749 --> 35:15.748
No worries.

35:15.783 --> 35:17.354
- I am worried.

35:17.389 --> 35:19.290
I'm a doctor, it's
my job to be worried.

35:19.325 --> 35:22.425
- I thought you were some
sort of paranormal doctor?

35:22.460 --> 35:25.329
- I am, but I'm also a doctor
of internal medicine as well.

35:25.364 --> 35:27.727
- Oh, that's quite impressive.

35:27.762 --> 35:29.795
- Let's take off your
shirt, let me examine you.

35:29.830 --> 35:31.698
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait
a minute, I just met you.

35:31.733 --> 35:33.601
You're not gonna at least
buy me a drink or something?

35:33.636 --> 35:36.208
- So silly, let
me just take your shirt.

35:36.936 --> 35:37.836
- Oh, man.

35:42.282 --> 35:44.645
- Okay, I need to look at
your neck and your spine.

35:44.680 --> 35:46.185
I'm a bit concerned.

35:49.982 --> 35:51.982
Does it hurt right there?
- Ow, yes!

35:52.017 --> 35:54.457
- I'm sorry, that's a hematoma.

35:54.492 --> 35:56.459
- What the hell is that?

35:56.494 --> 35:58.230
- Well, that's not another that

35:58.265 --> 35:59.693
that's where blood is collected

35:59.728 --> 36:02.234
under the skin where
the injury was.

36:02.269 --> 36:03.631
Are you feeling dizzy?

36:03.666 --> 36:05.699
- Yeah, a little, yeah.

36:05.734 --> 36:08.636
- Yeah, I'm a little concerned
you've got a concussion.

36:08.671 --> 36:10.407
Just don't go to sleep.

36:10.442 --> 36:12.805
Don't take a nap for
at least six hours.

36:12.840 --> 36:14.807
- Why is that?

36:14.842 --> 36:16.875
- Because you might not wake up.

36:21.750 --> 36:23.387
- Did you hear that?

36:23.422 --> 36:24.388
- What?

36:24.423 --> 36:26.291
- Nothing.

36:26.326 --> 36:28.425
- Put your shirt on, we should
go catch up with the girls.

36:28.460 --> 36:29.558
- Okay.

36:29.593 --> 36:32.264
You go ahead, and I'll catch up.

36:56.389 --> 36:57.982
- He's gotta be close.

36:58.017 --> 37:01.425
I mean, those sounds are
getting louder and the tracks.

37:01.460 --> 37:03.295
You know, you're lucky
when he came up behind you

37:03.330 --> 37:05.792
on the bridge that
he didn't hurt you.

37:05.827 --> 37:06.694
Jesse?

37:07.829 --> 37:08.696
Jesse?

37:11.063 --> 37:12.337
Jesse, where'd you go?

37:15.441 --> 37:16.308
Jesse?

37:19.577 --> 37:21.445
- It's so hot.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.348
I don't think we
went the right way.

37:23.383 --> 37:24.811
- No.
- I don't know.

37:24.846 --> 37:26.582
I wish there was some
way we could cool off.

37:26.617 --> 37:27.979
- I put my hair up.

37:28.014 --> 37:29.321
It's not helping.
- It's getting hotter.

37:29.356 --> 37:31.048
- Yeah, I don't know what to do.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.720
- Well, I'm a stripper, so
I'm gonna start stripping.

37:32.755 --> 37:34.293

- Hi, I'm Director Jim Wynorski,

38:45.157 --> 38:47.762
and I'm stopping
this film right now.

38:47.797 --> 38:49.830
There's just too
much gratuitous sex.

40:37.709 --> 40:38.576
- Jesse?

40:40.173 --> 40:41.040
Jesse!

40:42.142 --> 40:43.108
- Freeze!

40:43.143 --> 40:44.747
- Who are you?

40:44.782 --> 40:46.177
- Who the hell are you?

40:46.212 --> 40:49.213
- I'm Dr. Dawn from
the Dr. Dawn Show!

40:49.248 --> 40:50.247
- Dr. Dawn.

40:50.282 --> 40:51.886
- Who's that?

40:51.921 --> 40:54.284
- The Dr. Dawn Show was
canceled 20 years ago.

40:54.319 --> 40:56.561
- Well, who are you,
where are you from?

40:56.596 --> 41:00.125
- We're from 2050, and
we're here hunting Bigfoot.

41:00.160 --> 41:02.798
- We were here first,
we're hunting Bigfoot.

41:02.833 --> 41:04.668
- We're the ones that
are gonna hunt Bigfoot

41:04.703 --> 41:06.131
because we need his crap.

41:06.166 --> 41:07.539
- Oh no, you're not.

41:07.574 --> 41:09.706
- Yeah, and it's
worth trillions.

41:09.741 --> 41:12.005
- You're telling me that
you are collecting his poop?

41:12.040 --> 41:13.237
- We're getting his poop.

41:13.272 --> 41:16.009
- Bigfoot is passing gold bars?

41:16.044 --> 41:18.880
- Practically, and
we're gonna be rich!

41:18.915 --> 41:20.310
- Yes!
- That's right.

41:20.345 --> 41:22.653
- I'm a scientist,
this is fascinating.

41:22.688 --> 41:23.819
What are you gonna do with it?

41:23.854 --> 41:25.150
- Doesn't matter what you think

41:25.185 --> 41:27.856
because we have the big guns.

41:27.891 --> 41:30.925
- Oh yeah, well
look at these guns.

41:32.929 --> 41:33.994
- She's got pretty big guns.

41:34.029 --> 41:35.325
- Wow.
- Yeah.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.602
- Those are...

41:37.637 --> 41:38.603
big guns.

41:38.638 --> 41:39.967
Well, what about yours?

41:41.168 --> 41:43.740
- We got big guns too.
- Mm-hmm.

41:46.679 --> 41:48.338
- So you are out.

41:48.373 --> 41:51.143
- You're not gonna hurt him
with those guns, are you?

41:51.178 --> 41:54.278
- No, we're just gonna
scare the poop out of him.

41:56.315 --> 41:57.886
- What do you do in the future?

41:57.921 --> 41:59.690
What is this poop gonna be for?

42:01.628 --> 42:02.891
I need to know about this, I
need to know about everything.

42:02.926 --> 42:04.321
- All right, enough of this.

42:04.356 --> 42:05.322
- Well, tell me
about the future.

42:05.357 --> 42:06.323
What is it about?

42:06.358 --> 42:07.797
- I'm gonna zap her.

42:11.099 --> 42:12.230
All right, that's
good, let's go.

42:12.265 --> 42:13.198
- Okay.

42:13.233 --> 42:14.100
- Jesse?

42:15.873 --> 42:16.740
Jesse!

42:17.743 --> 42:18.610
Jesse?

42:25.212 --> 42:26.816
- Whoo!
- Whoo hoo!

42:28.116 --> 42:29.984
- Hey, let's try
some Bigfoot calling!

42:30.019 --> 42:31.722
- Oh yeah, let's do that.

42:31.757 --> 42:32.888
- Let's try it.

42:35.123 --> 42:36.727
- Bigfoot!

42:38.357 --> 42:39.994
Whoo!
- Whoo!

42:40.029 --> 42:41.963
Come out, come out, Bigfoot!

42:41.998 --> 42:43.393
Okay, that one again,
that one again.

42:49.236 --> 42:51.137
Okay, let's try that one,
see what that one does.

42:58.377 --> 42:59.684
That should do it.

42:59.719 --> 43:01.114
Come out, come out, Bigfoot.

43:01.149 --> 43:02.247
- Yeah, where's
Bigfoot, come on.

43:02.282 --> 43:03.886
- Okay, try the first one again.

43:03.921 --> 43:05.316
Try that one, that
was a good one.

43:14.360 --> 43:16.701
Whoo!

43:16.736 --> 43:18.065
That was very loud!

43:18.100 --> 43:20.397
Let's put the volume up, whoo!

43:27.340 --> 43:28.207
Whoo!

43:41.057 --> 43:43.860

- What happened?

43:43.895 --> 43:44.993
- Where's Jesse?

43:45.028 --> 43:47.028
- I don't know, Jesse's gone.

43:47.063 --> 43:48.898
- What happened?
- I don't know.

43:48.933 --> 43:51.703
I mean, I look around and
she's just not there anymore.

43:51.738 --> 43:52.396
Don't know where she went.

43:52.431 --> 43:53.738
- Oh my God.

43:53.773 --> 43:55.036
- Did Bigfoot come back for her?

43:55.071 --> 43:57.236
- He came back for her!
- Oh my God.

43:57.271 --> 43:58.875
- I think so, I don't know.

43:58.910 --> 44:00.745
I don't know anything!

44:00.780 --> 44:02.175
- Where did it happen?
- You didn't see anything?

44:02.210 --> 44:04.342
- Look, we've got two
hours of daylight left.

44:04.377 --> 44:05.915
We gotta find her.

44:05.950 --> 44:06.784
- We gotta hurry, come on.

44:06.819 --> 44:07.917

- No, we can't tell Dateline.

45:20.519 --> 45:21.925
- Like, they'd be interested.

45:21.960 --> 45:23.157
This would be a scoop.

45:23.192 --> 45:24.521
- You would never be famous.

45:24.556 --> 45:26.160

gonna make me famous?

45:36.975 --> 45:38.843
- What was that?

45:38.878 --> 45:40.339
- Jesse!

45:40.374 --> 45:41.846
- Jesse!

45:43.850 --> 45:45.080
- Oh my God.

45:45.115 --> 45:46.345
- She's alive.

45:46.380 --> 45:48.248
- What happened?

45:48.283 --> 45:50.085
- Oh my God, when I left
you, I went down the hill.

45:50.120 --> 45:51.515
- We were so worried.

45:51.550 --> 45:53.088
- I was walking
around for a bit,

45:53.123 --> 45:56.861
and I like saw Bigfoot
in the distance.

45:56.896 --> 45:58.522
- Again?

45:58.557 --> 46:01.558
- Just all of a sudden
it made a beeline for me.

46:01.593 --> 46:03.164
And I was like
kinda behind rocks.

46:03.199 --> 46:04.935
And he started chasing me.

46:04.970 --> 46:06.365
And then he came close to me,

46:06.400 --> 46:07.465
and he was trying
to pull my bra off.

46:07.500 --> 46:08.466
- Oh my God.

46:13.913 --> 46:15.143
Wait, that's nothing.

46:15.178 --> 46:16.606
He actually physically...

46:19.083 --> 46:20.478
Tried to take my bra off.

46:20.513 --> 46:23.415
- He's a pervert,
first and foremost.

46:23.450 --> 46:25.054
Just saying.

46:25.089 --> 46:26.924
- Guys, listen, he's
not just after me.

46:26.959 --> 46:28.255
He's about a block away.

46:30.226 --> 46:31.929
He's on my tail.

46:31.964 --> 46:33.326
- He's coming, he's
coming to the house?

46:33.361 --> 46:35.559
- Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

46:35.594 --> 46:38.001
Aren't we trying to
find this mother fucker?

46:38.036 --> 46:40.168
- Okay, but you can't fight
him off with flashlights.

46:40.203 --> 46:41.598
You guys need to be armed.

46:43.239 --> 46:44.942
- Oh my God, weapons,

46:44.977 --> 46:46.405

46:46.440 --> 46:47.406

- Let's get the weapons.

46:47.441 --> 46:48.979
- Weapons!

46:50.675 --> 46:51.916

46:51.951 --> 46:53.115
- Nope.
- No.

46:54.954 --> 46:58.120
- Wait a second, where's Jesse?

46:58.155 --> 47:00.320
Did we lose her again?

47:00.355 --> 47:02.124
- Do you think Bigfoot got her?

47:02.159 --> 47:04.863
- Nah, she's just in
the room changing.

47:06.031 --> 47:07.591
- It's been a stressful day.

47:07.626 --> 47:08.933
- What do we do?

47:08.968 --> 47:10.396

51:16.677 --> 51:19.216
- Oh yeah, the brunettes.

51:19.251 --> 51:21.680
- Jesse, Tilly,
while we're young!

51:22.551 --> 51:24.287
- She's gone!

51:24.322 --> 51:26.652
Jesse's disappeared again.

51:26.687 --> 51:27.785
- What do you mean?

51:27.820 --> 51:29.622
- I looked for her everywhere.

51:29.657 --> 51:33.263
In the bathrooms, the
bedrooms, the garage, poof!

51:33.298 --> 51:34.693
- What?
- Yeah.

51:37.731 --> 51:41.238
- Something stinks in Denmark.

51:41.273 --> 51:42.932
And I'll tell you why.

51:42.967 --> 51:45.341
Do you guys remember yesterday

51:45.376 --> 51:50.379
she "supposedly" fell off
a bridge onto a big rock?

51:51.778 --> 51:53.943
Bitch didn't have
a scratch on her.

51:53.978 --> 51:58.552
And then she showed up
at the house last night,

51:58.587 --> 52:00.389
face on point.

52:00.424 --> 52:01.522
- That was weird.

52:02.888 --> 52:04.558
- Hair did.

52:05.990 --> 52:07.264
- What are you saying?

52:07.299 --> 52:09.299
Are you saying that...

52:09.334 --> 52:10.729
That she made this up?

52:10.764 --> 52:12.665
That Bigfoot really
didn't attack her?

52:12.700 --> 52:15.371
- Yeah, I mean, you know
what, with all that fur,

52:15.406 --> 52:16.966
that's probably the
fur that we found.

52:17.001 --> 52:19.375
She went back and got
it when she disappeared.

52:19.410 --> 52:20.805
- And that thing
about the bra strap.

52:20.840 --> 52:22.510
I mean, that was weird.

52:22.545 --> 52:24.380
I didn't believe that.
- She's crazy.

52:24.415 --> 52:28.879
- And last night she said the
fool was like a block away

52:29.882 --> 52:31.915
and coming right for us.

52:31.950 --> 52:34.357
Dude never showed up.

52:34.392 --> 52:37.558
- And we were dancing
all sexy and everything.

52:37.593 --> 52:39.329
I mean, if he was out there,

52:39.364 --> 52:41.562
he would've for sure
come and got us.

52:42.928 --> 52:44.829
- Let's go look for
him, her and Bigfoot.

52:44.864 --> 52:46.435
- Yeah, let's track 'em both.

52:47.438 --> 52:48.569
- Can we call Dateline?

52:50.441 --> 52:53.244
- So I have been practicing
at home, which my boyfriend,

52:53.279 --> 52:55.411
Roger, didn't really like it
'cause I was doing that...

52:56.744 --> 52:58.216
You know, getting my Catgirl on.

52:59.285 --> 53:01.450
And doing my paw licking stuff.

53:03.454 --> 53:05.718
- And people think
I'm hallucinating,

53:05.753 --> 53:07.489
but I know it was the real Elvis

53:07.524 --> 53:10.294
'cause he told me
and he assured me.

53:10.329 --> 53:13.396
- So I said, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding,

53:13.431 --> 53:15.332
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

53:16.962 --> 53:18.566
I've been trying to get out
of the stripping business

53:18.601 --> 53:21.866
for a minute now, trying
to find a new career.

53:21.901 --> 53:24.440
And I really wanna get famous.

53:24.475 --> 53:27.377
- I don't do dog stuff
'cause I'm a cat, right?

53:27.412 --> 53:30.644
So we're all gonna be getting
our spirit guide animal,

53:30.679 --> 53:32.547
getting the animalistic thing.

53:32.582 --> 53:37.013
And that's really gonna bring
out the feminine pheromones

53:37.048 --> 53:39.884
in all of us, but
our animalistic kind.

53:39.919 --> 53:42.788
- My sponsorship has
been going down a little.

53:42.823 --> 53:45.494
So what I did...

53:45.529 --> 53:48.992
- I decided to get into the...

53:49.027 --> 53:51.665
- Was I said, I'm
gonna go find Bigfoot.

53:51.700 --> 53:54.602
- Looking for Bigfoot business.

53:54.637 --> 53:56.769
- I'm gonna get a
selfie with Bigfoot.

53:56.804 --> 53:58.408
- So I'm very excited.

53:58.443 --> 54:01.444
You know, we got a
bunch of girls here.

54:01.479 --> 54:03.941
We're all gonna be
getting our furry on.

54:03.976 --> 54:07.714
- And hopefully there is a
Bigfoot out there somewhere,

54:07.749 --> 54:09.584
and if there is...

54:09.619 --> 54:12.081
- And we're gonna find him,
and we're gonna get him.

54:12.116 --> 54:15.458
We're gonna empower him
with our femininity.

54:15.493 --> 54:17.020
- I'm gonna find him.

54:17.055 --> 54:19.627
- We're gonna interact with him.

54:19.662 --> 54:22.729
We're gonna find out about
his thoughts and his feelings

54:22.764 --> 54:24.764
and his inner self,
and why he's been

54:24.799 --> 54:26.832
hiding out all these years.

54:26.867 --> 54:28.636
- I would bet on me.

54:28.671 --> 54:30.737
If you're a betting
person, Vegas odds have it,

54:30.772 --> 54:32.838
that we're 50 to one,
whatever that means.

54:32.873 --> 54:34.477
I'm not a betting person.

54:34.512 --> 54:38.415
- So I met some other
girls along the way,

54:38.450 --> 54:40.615
and they are out to
do the same thing.

54:41.585 --> 54:43.519
Five girls together?

54:43.554 --> 54:46.489
Now come on guys,
you can't beat that.

54:47.591 --> 54:49.327
We're gonna get him.

57:13.297 --> 57:15.132
- Wait, I'm getting a signal.

57:15.167 --> 57:19.543
It's detecting
something right here.

57:19.578 --> 57:20.874
- Do you see anything?

57:20.909 --> 57:22.007
- What is it?

57:22.042 --> 57:24.548
- Someone fell here recently.

57:24.583 --> 57:26.011
- Who?

57:26.046 --> 57:27.782
- Wait a minute, wait a
minute, I'm getting it.

57:30.919 --> 57:33.986
There's some hot chicks.

57:34.956 --> 57:36.054
- What?
- Wait.

57:36.089 --> 57:37.187
Are they hotter than, than us?

57:37.222 --> 57:38.661
- No.
- No way.

57:38.696 --> 57:40.058
- No.

57:40.093 --> 57:43.963
But it means that
there's a lot of them.

57:43.998 --> 57:45.767
- No way.

57:45.802 --> 57:47.835
- And they're also
hunting Bigfoot.

57:49.806 --> 57:53.137
It just means that we're
gonna have to be hotter,

57:54.305 --> 57:57.680
faster, sexier and...

57:57.715 --> 57:58.879
- Bustier!

57:58.914 --> 58:01.178
- Yes.
- Bustier, that's it.

58:01.213 --> 58:02.850
Now I know what we're
gonna have to do.

58:02.885 --> 58:06.216
We're gonna have to use
this press-ta-digitizer,

58:06.251 --> 58:08.251
and we're gonna need to
transport out of here

58:08.286 --> 58:09.923
to a better location.

58:09.958 --> 58:11.056
We can do this.
- Yes.

58:11.091 --> 58:12.255
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

58:12.290 --> 58:13.795
- All right and...

58:28.944 --> 58:32.682
- Bubba, you are getting
rid of that ugly TV

58:33.751 --> 58:35.278
if it is the last thing you do.

58:35.313 --> 58:38.215
I don't care if it's
got a built in VHS.

58:38.250 --> 58:40.052
- It's battery operated!

58:40.087 --> 58:42.692
- You stole it from
the thrift store.

58:42.727 --> 58:44.859
And how much do you think
you're gonna get for it now?

58:44.894 --> 58:46.058
- Oh, come on, sis.

58:46.093 --> 58:47.697
You got it so easy.

58:47.732 --> 58:49.798
I'm trying to pay for
college here, all right?

58:49.833 --> 58:51.899
- Oh, pfft, I take
care of your ass.

58:51.934 --> 58:54.935
Here, it's $2, take it.

58:54.970 --> 58:56.574
What I owe you, 10 more?

58:58.336 --> 59:02.008
Now, Bubba, you cannot
get caught stealing
again, all right?

59:02.043 --> 59:03.845
You're not gonna be
able to go to college

59:03.880 --> 59:06.848
because you're gonna
go to the pokey!

59:06.883 --> 59:09.081
You remember that time
that you got caught

59:09.116 --> 59:11.787
flashing those nuns in public?

59:14.187 --> 59:15.725
- Yeah.

59:15.760 --> 59:18.629
- Well, you stole those
prescription drugs

59:18.664 --> 59:20.257
from that store after hours?

59:20.292 --> 59:22.160
- Oh my God.

59:22.195 --> 59:23.799
Yeah, I remember that.

59:23.834 --> 59:25.064
- Bubba, you're old
enough now you are

59:25.099 --> 59:26.934
gonna go to the big house.

59:26.969 --> 59:29.200
- What, really?

59:29.235 --> 59:31.070
- I'm gonna go on down
just right past this crick,

59:31.105 --> 59:32.643
and you're gonna get
this thing outta here.

59:32.678 --> 59:33.875
Do you understand?

59:37.980 --> 59:38.847
Now git!

59:49.156 --> 59:50.419
Go, go, go!

59:50.454 --> 59:52.927
- It's battery-operated,
come on.

59:56.427 --> 59:57.668
- Attaboy.

1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:05.907
Get in.

1:00:09.880 --> 1:00:10.978
- All right, let's go.

1:00:11.013 --> 1:00:12.111
- I'm proud of you, Bubba.

1:00:12.146 --> 1:00:13.376
Let's go get some ice cream.

1:00:40.207 --> 1:00:42.779
- Hello, I'm Screens.

1:00:42.814 --> 1:00:46.948
I work as a monitoring system
for Robo Sports Action Now.

1:00:46.983 --> 1:00:49.247
- Oh, I can't believe I'm
actually afraid of a penis.

1:00:49.282 --> 1:00:50.380
Who would've thought?

1:00:50.415 --> 1:00:51.381
- A blue one at that.

1:00:51.416 --> 1:00:52.151
- I don't wanna die!

1:01:23.019 --> 1:01:24.381
- No, no!

1:01:27.419 --> 1:01:30.827
- It's the
Dr. Dawn Show in 3D.

1:01:31.896 --> 1:01:34.490
With your host, Dr. Dawn.

1:01:34.525 --> 1:01:36.866
Tonight's special
guest, Penny Blossom.

1:01:36.901 --> 1:01:41.200
And tonight's topic is none
other than Bigfoot as usual.

1:01:41.235 --> 1:01:43.466
Hello, Dr. Gail.

1:01:43.501 --> 1:01:47.910
- Hi, I'm Dr. Dawn,
doctor of parapsychology,

1:01:47.945 --> 1:01:50.880
doctor of internal medicine
and sometimes surgery.

1:01:50.915 --> 1:01:54.917
And I'm here with my very
special guest, Penny Blossom.

1:01:54.952 --> 1:01:56.853
- Hi!

1:01:56.888 --> 1:01:58.855
- And tonight we're gonna
be talking about Bigfoot.

1:01:58.890 --> 1:02:00.285
- Yay.

1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:02.419
- So Penny, you think
you actually so Bigfoot?

1:02:02.454 --> 1:02:04.828
- Oh, I know I saw him.

1:02:04.863 --> 1:02:08.260
My friends doubted me, but
I was up near Sacramento.

1:02:08.295 --> 1:02:10.262
I was panning for
gold 'cause you know,

1:02:10.297 --> 1:02:12.099
I'm a golddigger.

1:02:12.134 --> 1:02:14.970
And there he was in the
distance, and my friend said,

1:02:15.005 --> 1:02:16.400
"No, that's not Bigfoot."

1:02:16.435 --> 1:02:18.303
And I said, "It is,
I know it's Bigfoot."

1:02:18.338 --> 1:02:23.308
He's a big and handsome, young
looking ape and...

1:02:25.147 --> 1:02:27.081
I didn't know what to do,
and then he disappeared.

1:02:27.116 --> 1:02:28.082
- Oh, was he handsome?

1:02:28.117 --> 1:02:29.512
Was he really handsome?

1:02:29.547 --> 1:02:31.085
Was he really hairy
chest and everything?

1:02:31.120 --> 1:02:32.889
Oh!
- Oh my God.

1:02:32.924 --> 1:02:35.089
- My viewers know that
I wrote a bestseller.

1:02:35.124 --> 1:02:38.389
It's called Bigfoot and Dr.
- The True Love Story.

1:02:38.424 --> 1:02:40.831
And we have been
communicating, telepathically.

1:02:40.866 --> 1:02:43.097
He's been coming every
night in my dreams.

1:02:43.132 --> 1:02:45.363
And so we're going to be
going and finding him.

1:02:45.398 --> 1:02:48.839
So are you excited to be on
this expedition with us, Penny?

1:02:48.874 --> 1:02:50.500
- I am so excited.

1:02:50.535 --> 1:02:52.205
Be still my beating heart.

1:02:53.945 --> 1:02:56.176
- We've had a few
expeditions before,

1:02:56.211 --> 1:02:58.882
and some of the girls didn't
make it, unfortunately.

1:02:58.917 --> 1:03:00.477
Last time we had
a bear incident.

1:03:00.512 --> 1:03:02.380
But this time's
gonna be really good

1:03:02.415 --> 1:03:05.581
'cause we have our guns locked
and loaded and ready to go.

1:03:05.616 --> 1:03:08.056
Yes?
- I have my crossbow.

1:03:08.091 --> 1:03:09.387
And I don't wanna kill Bigfoot,

1:03:09.422 --> 1:03:11.323
but I, we need to be protected.

1:03:11.358 --> 1:03:12.962
- Oh no, we're not
gonna kill him.

1:03:12.997 --> 1:03:15.294
No, no, no, we're gonna,
we're gonna find him.

1:03:15.329 --> 1:03:16.460
We're gonna lure him in.

1:03:16.495 --> 1:03:18.297
We're gonna seduce him.

1:03:18.332 --> 1:03:21.971
And we're gonna have
a relationship, right?

1:03:22.006 --> 1:03:24.006
- That's right.

1:03:24.041 --> 1:03:27.075
- I'm gonna finish my
fantasy book about him

1:03:27.110 --> 1:03:28.208
because, oh wow.

1:03:28.243 --> 1:03:30.045
He's so big and handsome.

1:03:30.080 --> 1:03:32.575
And, oh, I can't wait
to just to meet him

1:03:32.610 --> 1:03:34.610
and have him hold
me in his arms,

1:03:34.645 --> 1:03:38.350
and his big, hairy, his big
hairy chest against mine.

1:03:38.385 --> 1:03:41.859
Oh, just to make out and
kiss with him and ooh, ooh!

1:03:42.686 --> 1:03:43.352

1:04:52.558 --> 1:04:54.965
- Two kilometers from
where we were last.

1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:56.329
- North, West, South, what?

1:04:56.364 --> 1:04:58.001
- I don't know.

1:04:59.466 --> 1:05:00.696
- Well, let's just
take a look around.

1:05:00.731 --> 1:05:01.598
- What is this?

1:05:04.042 --> 1:05:05.943
- Holy moth balls!

1:05:07.012 --> 1:05:08.341
That looks like a piece of crap!

1:05:08.376 --> 1:05:11.080
- Bigfoot's crap!

1:05:11.115 --> 1:05:12.477
- Oh God, what are we gonna do?

1:05:12.512 --> 1:05:15.216
We can't touch it.
- Okay, I got an idea.

1:05:15.251 --> 1:05:17.383
Let's put our energy together,

1:05:17.418 --> 1:05:20.320
and transport it
forward to 2050.

1:05:20.355 --> 1:05:22.025
- That's it, that's it.

1:05:22.060 --> 1:05:24.962
- Beyond
ho, away we go.

1:05:26.130 --> 1:05:27.998
Beyond ho, away we go.

1:05:29.628 --> 1:05:31.496
Beyond ho, away we go.

1:05:33.269 --> 1:05:35.137
Beyond ho, away we go.

1:05:37.537 --> 1:05:41.077
- Holy crap, we're
gonna be trillionaires!

1:05:41.112 --> 1:05:42.144
- I love it!

1:05:44.214 --> 1:05:46.709
- Oh my God, that was a big one!

1:05:56.226 --> 1:05:57.225
- Oh my God.

1:05:58.261 --> 1:06:00.393
- Oh wow.
- What is that?

1:06:01.429 --> 1:06:03.165
It's a hoof print.

1:06:03.200 --> 1:06:05.431
Looks like I'm finally
gonna get my selfie.

1:06:05.466 --> 1:06:07.532
- It's so big.

1:06:07.567 --> 1:06:10.403
And you know what they say
about men with big feet?

1:06:10.438 --> 1:06:13.670
- My ex-boyfriend had big
feet, definitely worth it.

1:06:13.705 --> 1:06:17.377
- This monster probably
has pretty big hands too.

1:06:17.412 --> 1:06:19.346
- He's close by.

1:06:19.381 --> 1:06:20.479
- Let's go find him.

1:06:20.514 --> 1:06:21.480
Let's get that selfie for you.

1:06:21.515 --> 1:06:23.086
- Let's get the selfie.

1:06:23.121 --> 1:06:24.087
- Let's go get
this fool, ladies.

1:06:33.560 --> 1:06:36.759
- I think she's
definitely from the loony bin.

1:06:36.794 --> 1:06:39.465
- Oh yeah,
that's plausible.

1:06:39.500 --> 1:06:41.434
- You know what, we set
out to find Bigfoot.

1:06:41.469 --> 1:06:42.732
Let's just go look for him.

1:06:42.767 --> 1:06:44.074
We'll find her on the way.

1:06:44.109 --> 1:06:47.605
- Ladies, I think at this point

1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:52.610
we really gotta accept
there ain't no Bigfoot!

1:07:25.150 --> 1:07:26.611
- We may never
see that girl again.

1:07:26.646 --> 1:07:29.152
- Yeah.
- She's lost forever probably.

1:07:29.187 --> 1:07:30.714
- She may be gone for good.

1:07:32.652 --> 1:07:34.190
- Jesse!

1:07:34.225 --> 1:07:35.587
Where have you been?

1:07:36.920 --> 1:07:38.590
- Don't give me that
look, I know that look.

1:07:38.625 --> 1:07:40.394
- Bitch!
- I know, I know, I know.

1:07:40.429 --> 1:07:43.760
I got up early this
morning, and I was inspired.

1:07:43.795 --> 1:07:45.861
And I always like to
write when I'm inspired.

1:07:45.896 --> 1:07:49.535
And I wrote a song for
our quest to get Bigfoot.

1:07:49.570 --> 1:07:50.668
- For what?
- We were worried about you.

1:07:50.703 --> 1:07:52.538
- I wrote a song.

1:07:52.573 --> 1:07:55.244
I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
but you'll love the song.

1:07:55.279 --> 1:07:56.674
- So you wrote a song?

1:07:56.709 --> 1:07:57.708
- Of course, it's
about all of us.

1:07:57.743 --> 1:07:59.182
- All right.

1:07:59.217 --> 1:08:00.480
- Actually.
- Can we hear the song?

1:08:00.515 --> 1:08:01.613
- I wanna hear it.
- Yeah.

1:08:01.648 --> 1:08:03.483
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1:08:03.518 --> 1:08:04.880
- Now I wrote it with
like a Western spaghetti,

1:08:04.915 --> 1:08:06.222
Southern twang kind
of a feel to it.

1:08:06.257 --> 1:08:07.355
Like kind of a like, you know,

1:08:07.390 --> 1:08:09.819

1:08:09.854 --> 1:08:12.327

1:09:51.626 --> 1:09:52.955
We need to change.

1:09:52.990 --> 1:09:54.792

1:10:07.037 --> 1:10:07.904
- No, okay.

1:10:16.387 --> 1:10:17.617
It's getting better.
- Yeah.

1:10:17.652 --> 1:10:18.783
- Maybe a little bit, you know?

1:10:18.818 --> 1:10:20.422

1:10:22.954 --> 1:10:25.790

Nah, one more.

1:10:46.714 --> 1:10:48.351

1:11:04.699 --> 1:11:05.698
We're ready.

1:11:08.769 --> 1:11:11.572
All right, team, we did it.

1:11:12.509 --> 1:11:14.036
We're looking great.

1:11:14.071 --> 1:11:18.007
Time for 2050.

1:11:22.651 --> 1:11:24.387

the red carpet.

1:11:25.918 --> 1:11:27.522
What is this, the
Academy Awards?

1:11:27.557 --> 1:11:28.655
I thought we were
hunting Bigfoot.

1:11:28.690 --> 1:11:30.492
You really didn't have to.

1:11:31.693 --> 1:11:32.791
- What was that?

1:11:32.826 --> 1:11:34.364
That was something big in there.

1:11:34.399 --> 1:11:35.794
- It sure sounded big.

1:11:40.130 --> 1:11:42.504
- That's Bigfoot,
that's Bigfoot!

1:11:42.539 --> 1:11:44.539
- Fuck, I wanna be famous!

1:11:59.688 --> 1:12:00.720
- Did you get an alert?
- Yes, we did.

1:12:00.755 --> 1:12:02.557
He's up on the overlook.

1:12:02.592 --> 1:12:04.625
That critter's up there
right now, let's go, move it.

1:12:04.660 --> 1:12:06.055
Here you go, let's go.

1:12:06.090 --> 1:12:07.529

go, go, go, go.

1:12:13.768 --> 1:12:14.635
- Don't you move.

1:12:16.441 --> 1:12:18.100
- Stop, stop, don't hurt him.

1:12:20.577 --> 1:12:23.941
- Oh my God, this
is really happening.

1:12:27.980 --> 1:12:28.847
- Oh!

1:12:33.623 --> 1:12:36.723
- Damn, he's kinda hot.

1:12:50.871 --> 1:12:53.872
- Oh, Bigfoot, I've looked
for you my entire life.

1:12:53.907 --> 1:12:55.511
You're so amazing.

1:12:55.546 --> 1:12:57.876

anyone, have you?

1:12:57.911 --> 1:12:58.778
- Oh.

1:13:00.749 --> 1:13:02.914
