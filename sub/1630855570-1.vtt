WEBVTT

00:30.541 --> 00:32.875
Many people call us idols,

00:33.625 --> 00:37.083
heroines, icons,
stars, leaders,

00:37.416 --> 00:38.500
and they are right.

00:38.916 --> 00:41.625
But we do our work very humbly.

00:43.333 --> 00:44.541
A poet said:

00:45.666 --> 00:48.583
With great powers
come great responsibilities.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.125
And yes, we have used
the power of the SOS MAMIS

00:54.750 --> 00:57.833
for the good of the Saint
Michael School community,

00:58.208 --> 01:00.958
each of us, however,
is very different,

01:01.125 --> 01:03.708
but our strength
comes from our unity.

01:04.583 --> 01:06.041
Milagros,

01:06.458 --> 01:08.708
with her mountain-moving faith.

01:10.625 --> 01:11.625
Luna,

01:11.791 --> 01:14.625
our Captain Planet,
who always brings us

01:14.708 --> 01:16.625
-closer to Earth.
-Pacha Mama.

01:16.833 --> 01:17.875
That too.

01:17.958 --> 01:21.041
Julia.
Julia, our CEO.

01:21.208 --> 01:23.166
Who has taught each one of us

01:23.250 --> 01:25.458
that we can be
the Big Boss of our lives.

01:26.375 --> 01:27.541
And Clarita,

01:28.166 --> 01:30.375
our Clarita,
with her tools...

01:30.916 --> 01:31.958
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:32.083 --> 01:33.666
The screen, Clarita!

01:33.750 --> 01:35.166
Just a second.

01:36.291 --> 01:39.625
I was pretty sure,
that I had left it secured.

01:40.041 --> 01:41.375
This happens every day.

01:41.958 --> 01:44.625
I'll have to put a stone
with a wire to hold it

01:44.708 --> 01:46.125
because the springs are bad.

01:46.208 --> 01:47.250
-So...
-Hurry up.

01:47.333 --> 01:48.500
I pull it down,
but the springs....

01:48.583 --> 01:51.375
I think everyone
understood very clearly

01:51.458 --> 01:53.291
the contribution you have made
to the school community.

01:53.375 --> 01:54.500
Relax, Regina, I'm not done.

01:54.625 --> 01:56.083
There are other more pressing matters.

01:56.166 --> 01:59.416
You' ve been there for more
than 20 minutes, what is left to say?

01:59.958 --> 02:02.125
-Trini, me!
-Sure, Luna!

02:02.416 --> 02:04.125
Solve it fast.
Let's not waste any more time,

02:04.208 --> 02:05.791
mine costs money, okay? Bye.

02:12.750 --> 02:16.208
Please stop speaking
in that native language.

02:16.291 --> 02:17.375
Ok? Please.

02:19.458 --> 02:21.416
Father, Anthony, please come with me.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.750
-As vice president...
-Treasurer.

02:23.875 --> 02:26.125
-Is the same.
-Is not the same.

02:26.208 --> 02:28.375
I am honored to introduce

02:28.458 --> 02:31.375
the first family to benefit

02:31.458 --> 02:34.166
from the Clarita
Arts and Sciences grant,

02:34.250 --> 02:36.708
with a self-sacrificing mother
who has managed

02:36.833 --> 02:39.625
to raise her son on her own.

02:39.708 --> 02:42.875
With Father Anthony
we entrust ourselves to the Lord

02:42.958 --> 02:45.375
to make the best decision.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.291
And we did.

02:47.416 --> 02:50.375
Yes, with Milagros
we are a very good couple.

02:50.750 --> 02:52.166
Right, Milagros?

02:52.958 --> 02:54.916
Team, Father. Team.

02:55.166 --> 02:57.125
And we worked many nights.

02:57.291 --> 02:58.250
Luna!

02:58.333 --> 02:59.500
So many.

02:59.958 --> 03:02.750
In a spiritual retreat in Pomaire.

03:02.833 --> 03:04.708
What happened in Pomaire,
stays in Pomaire.

03:04.791 --> 03:06.250
Nights with a lot of passion.

03:06.375 --> 03:09.208
Like the passion of Jesus,
with sacrifice, with pain.

03:09.291 --> 03:11.833
And it is a process
that has brought me much pleasure.

03:11.916 --> 03:13.250
With Milagros, of course.

03:13.333 --> 03:14.416
Well done, Millie.

03:14.541 --> 03:16.041
Well, I want to introduce you

03:16.125 --> 03:19.083
to Álex Quintanilla and his mother,

03:19.791 --> 03:20.833
Daniela Muñoz.

03:22.125 --> 03:24.375
Bravo, our grant student.

03:24.583 --> 03:25.833
Bravo, bravo!

03:28.166 --> 03:30.166
Thank you very much to all.

03:31.916 --> 03:33.833
I wanted to thank you for

03:34.583 --> 03:36.791
welcoming us in this beautiful community,

03:37.458 --> 03:40.583
with my Alex we have not had
a very good time

03:40.666 --> 03:43.291
-due to the death of his father, but...
-Such a pity!

03:43.375 --> 03:46.833
...we knew that we would find
kind hearts in this capital.

03:47.916 --> 03:50.583
Well, Daniela comes from Mechuque,

03:50.666 --> 03:52.958
a very colorful island in Chiloé.

03:53.541 --> 03:54.666
Yes.

03:54.750 --> 03:57.625
Thank you all very much...
To Milagros and Father Anthony.

03:57.875 --> 03:58.875
Thanks.

03:58.958 --> 04:01.333
I only have one doubt.
I was checking the grant,

04:01.416 --> 04:04.583
what it includes, and I wanted to know
if it includes the school supplies,

04:04.666 --> 04:06.875
because I sent several emails
and I have not heard back.

04:06.958 --> 04:09.083
Thank you very much, Daniela, really.

04:09.166 --> 04:13.083
I am sure that Alex will have
a nice time at our school.

04:13.458 --> 04:16.333
Well, I guess you're not
the kind of people

04:16.416 --> 04:18.375
who want everything for free,
are you?

04:18.541 --> 04:20.083
-No? Ah, good.
-No...

04:20.166 --> 04:22.083
All right, seat.

04:22.166 --> 04:24.291
-Maria Grace, please.
-Did she hit you?

04:24.666 --> 04:26.291
I would like to remind everyone

04:26.375 --> 04:29.000
that this month we have
a mandatory charity event

04:29.083 --> 04:31.791
to raise funds for the nursing home
"Grandpa, tell me"

04:31.875 --> 04:34.500
one of the many humanitarian causes
that my foundation is in charge of.

04:34.583 --> 04:38.125
So, the collaboration
of all parents is very important.

04:38.208 --> 04:38.958
Each and all.

04:39.041 --> 04:41.291
Each and all parents

04:42.166 --> 04:43.416
without any exception.

04:47.041 --> 04:48.208
Don't worry.

04:57.708 --> 05:01.166
The supplies are not included
in the grant. Outrageous.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.958
ALERT!
PROTOCOL

05:03.166 --> 05:06.041
Neither are the school uniforms.
It's in the fine print of the grant

05:06.125 --> 05:07.625
which is not so fine.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.791
Well, we did everything
with the best of intentions.

05:10.875 --> 05:13.041
This world is full
of good intentions.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.333
That is corruption.

05:14.416 --> 05:15.541
We all know that the principal

05:15.625 --> 05:18.000
is in collusion with the guy
who sells the uniforms.

05:18.083 --> 05:21.000
-They are lovers.
-No, it's a rumour.

05:21.625 --> 05:22.791
Who has a tumor?

05:22.916 --> 05:24.208
I AM OUTRAGEED

05:25.041 --> 05:26.791
Our grant holder is very beautiful.

05:26.958 --> 05:29.166
Beautiful?
I find her quite normal.

05:29.791 --> 05:32.541
I was going through the spreadsheet
and we have a little money.

05:32.625 --> 05:35.541
We could give her
all the school supplies for the year.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.041
Like a welcome gift.

05:37.125 --> 05:40.458
No, the poor should not be given
fried fish on a platter.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.291
You have to teach them to fish.

05:42.583 --> 05:45.500
What if we invite her to our rehearsal
and give her the gift there?

05:51.916 --> 05:53.041
Will it be fine?

05:53.166 --> 05:55.875
We've been rehearsing for weeks,
mishap included.

05:55.958 --> 05:57.791
Obviously she won't be able to.
It is for advanced.

05:57.958 --> 06:01.041
Come on. I missed two weeks
due to my trip to France.

06:01.125 --> 06:03.541
I closed three million-dollar contracts
and I know it by heart.

06:03.625 --> 06:06.791
I haven't missed any rehearsal
and I still haven't learned it!

06:06.958 --> 06:08.708
Puppy,
put the xylophone in the backpack!

06:08.875 --> 06:12.083
Well, let it be clear
that I don't agree with the song.

06:12.208 --> 06:13.208
WHAT?

06:13.291 --> 06:14.333
STOP IT...

06:14.708 --> 06:15.708
ENOUGH!

06:16.416 --> 06:18.541
No, I will not get tired of repeating it.

06:18.625 --> 06:21.125
Does anyone have a spare flute
for Blanquita?

06:21.291 --> 06:22.666
Gross.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.250
Juan de Dios,
don't forget the flute.

06:25.333 --> 06:27.625
Stretch!
Shoulder, neck, shoulder.

06:27.708 --> 06:30.750
For God's sake, my Pig.
He is so patient with boys.

06:30.833 --> 06:33.541
-Children
-Oh, yeah. Children.

06:35.375 --> 06:38.166
Hey, this little new child...

06:38.958 --> 06:41.541
It is very late. Why don't we just
start the rehearsal without her?

06:41.625 --> 06:42.916
Here comes, poor thing.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.833
All humble, so she won't feel bad
for not being an expert dancer like me.

06:46.916 --> 06:48.541
You are not an expert dancer.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.291
That's the attitude!

06:50.375 --> 06:52.041
-Hello!
-Hello, Piggy!

06:52.333 --> 06:53.625
Welcome, welcome!

06:53.708 --> 06:55.750
-Didn't you bring your sports outfit?
-No...

06:55.958 --> 06:58.333
Honey, look, go play with
the other children, they are kind.

06:58.416 --> 06:59.958
Pig! Love!

07:00.083 --> 07:02.083
Pig! It's the grant boy.

07:02.708 --> 07:03.708
What?

07:03.791 --> 07:05.916
Integrate him.
Make him play.

07:06.958 --> 07:09.250
No, Pig, my love!
Welcome the new child!

07:09.791 --> 07:10.833
It's okay.

07:11.375 --> 07:13.583
My Pig.
Oh, how cute your ginger!

07:13.666 --> 07:14.333
Right?

07:14.458 --> 07:15.291
-Hello.
-Hi, sir.

07:15.375 --> 07:16.958
Sofia, my love, come on.

07:17.041 --> 07:18.291
They say they bring good luck too.

07:18.375 --> 07:19.416
Make him play.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.291
Don't worry, because while we rehearse
my Pig will take care of them.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.583
He is the most feminist thing there is,
he always helps me with the puppies.

07:25.666 --> 07:27.708
And by God,
what a handsome man too.

07:29.083 --> 07:30.458
Okay. Come here

07:30.541 --> 07:33.250
and see us rehearse, because
she didn't bring her sporting outfit.

07:33.541 --> 07:35.208
-No, I did.
-But, you didn't tell me.

07:35.291 --> 07:37.541
Because you didn't let me.
What happened is that I came by bus,

07:37.625 --> 07:39.250
so I put my clothes under.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.041
Do you mind
if I take off my clothes here?

07:41.291 --> 07:43.416
-We are all free here.
-No! I do not!

07:43.583 --> 07:45.041
-I do not care.
-Me too.

07:45.125 --> 07:46.583
So I do not slow you down.

07:47.958 --> 07:48.750
Okey, okey.

07:48.833 --> 07:50.875
Well, don't worry about learning
all the choreography today,

07:50.958 --> 07:52.958
because the presentation
is actually in another month.

07:53.250 --> 07:54.291
Ready.

07:54.541 --> 07:57.125
How beautiful, the most folkloric there
is, I love it, it's very Chilean.

07:57.208 --> 07:58.958
And come on Macarena and...

07:59.041 --> 08:01.708
Shinning, and shinning and shinning.

08:01.791 --> 08:03.750
Then swimming!
And swimming

08:04.000 --> 08:05.916
and swimming.
Travolta!

08:06.208 --> 08:08.375
Travolta... Stop, stop.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.875
Trinity, Travolta is like groove,

08:10.958 --> 08:12.291
Right? Travolta...

08:12.375 --> 08:15.083
-Okay.
-Good. Ok, from Travolta, everybody.

08:15.208 --> 08:16.208
All together.

08:16.291 --> 08:19.041
Travolta, Travolta, Travolta.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.708
Rib, rib, rib.

08:21.791 --> 08:22.958
And now...

08:23.125 --> 08:25.125
Sunrise, sunrise. Stop.

08:25.708 --> 08:27.541
Trini. Sunrise!

08:28.166 --> 08:30.291
-Okay.
-Five, six, seven, eight.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.582
Sunrise!

08:32.666 --> 08:34.832
And one, two, three, four.

08:35.041 --> 08:37.041
Kick and up!

08:37.332 --> 08:39.041
-What now!
-Let's stop a little,

08:39.125 --> 08:41.041
-I pulled a muscle.
-Everybody, take five.

08:41.125 --> 08:42.625
-Material fatigue.
-Daniela, please come here.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.666
-Go.
-Yeah, relax.

08:46.416 --> 08:48.041
Daniela, I'm impressed!

08:48.125 --> 08:50.625
-Thank you!
-I want everyone to follow Daniela.

08:50.708 --> 08:53.500
Daniela has the groove
this dance needs

08:53.583 --> 08:55.541
and we hadn't achieved in a month.

08:55.625 --> 08:57.541
Daniela, please take Trini's position.

08:57.625 --> 08:58.791
Trini go to the back.

08:58.875 --> 09:01.041
Wait, sorry,
if we don't respect the formation

09:01.125 --> 09:03.833
everyone else will get confused
without having me as a reference.

09:03.916 --> 09:05.541
Girls, is anyone confused?

09:05.625 --> 09:06.625
-No.
-No.

09:06.708 --> 09:08.541
-Great!
-Daniela, please.

09:08.625 --> 09:09.666
Excuse me, Trini.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.333
Trinity, to the back.

09:11.625 --> 09:13.166
-Let's go.
-From the beginning?

09:13.500 --> 09:14.875
From the top.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.875
Oops, we are together!

09:18.958 --> 09:20.208
Five, six, seven, eight.

09:20.333 --> 09:24.666
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.541
Chuchuka, chuchuka.

09:26.625 --> 09:28.750
And Macarena to the side, yes!

09:29.333 --> 09:30.458
Let's see...

09:31.541 --> 09:33.708
Warm, warm, warm, warm.

09:35.250 --> 09:36.708
How nice, Daniela.

09:37.416 --> 09:41.041
Really integrated into the community,
a member of the group.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.500
She even gets along with your husband.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.916
I didn't know he was such
a great talker. Impressed.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.958
Look at my Inti playing with Alex.

09:48.041 --> 09:50.541
Good, even though my Dante
is very selective.

09:50.625 --> 09:54.125
You can tell this poor kid
was raised with good soft skills.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.583
Yes, my Sofi is also
the most soft skilled there is.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.541
Hey, it's getting late. Where is Milagros?
We must hand over the box.

09:59.625 --> 10:01.708
-Here I am, here I am.
-Finally, Millie!

10:01.833 --> 10:03.125
Well, quick,
it's too late now.

10:03.208 --> 10:04.625
Very late.
I have many things to do.

10:04.791 --> 10:05.500
Daniela!

10:05.583 --> 10:07.833
-Daniela.
-Got to go.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.625
Quick, pretty.

10:09.708 --> 10:11.333
-Come, sweetie.
-Yes, yes!

10:12.958 --> 10:14.458
Dear Daniela,

10:14.625 --> 10:15.833
on behalf of all...

10:15.916 --> 10:17.708
As president of the parents
of the 5th D,

10:17.791 --> 10:20.500
representing the SOS MAMIS,

10:20.708 --> 10:22.541
I would like to give you
this humble gift.

10:22.625 --> 10:25.041
We would like.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.125
Yes, we.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.208
-Here.
-For me?

10:29.291 --> 10:31.791
-What is this?
-The supplies for the whole year!

10:31.958 --> 10:34.125
-Yay!
-Bravo Bravo!

10:34.250 --> 10:37.666
Thank you very much, really,
I can't thank you enough...

10:37.750 --> 10:40.791
Whatever, make this quick,
I have to work. I work.

10:40.875 --> 10:42.875
Yes, actually,
I can't thank you enough...

10:42.958 --> 10:45.291
Great, great. Better that way,
let's go. Congratulations.

10:45.375 --> 10:46.541
-Thank you.
-Very good, sweetie.

10:46.625 --> 10:49.041
Honestly, I've never had this before.

10:49.541 --> 10:51.375
-Supplies?
-No.

10:52.958 --> 10:55.208
-Friends.
-Ugh, what a drag...

10:55.458 --> 10:56.458
Poor dear.

10:56.541 --> 10:57.625
So sweet.

10:59.875 --> 11:01.666
Oh, may the Lord protect her.

11:02.958 --> 11:04.416
We did it well.

11:08.041 --> 11:09.625
Oh, my mom.
Say hello.

11:09.958 --> 11:11.833
- Hello.
- Hello.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.875
Puppy, where is Bubbles?
It's time to sleep.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.208
Where is your snuggle pal?

11:23.291 --> 11:24.625
I can not find it.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.500
Where is Bubbles?

11:26.708 --> 11:28.625
-What?
-Bubbles. Where is it?

11:29.208 --> 11:30.750
I lost it in Alex's game.

11:31.125 --> 11:34.291
-What?
-You couldn't play if you didn't bet.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.208
He was very good
and he beat us all.

11:37.250 --> 11:38.333
Puppy.

11:38.625 --> 11:40.750
Bubbles is your snuggle pal.

11:41.125 --> 11:44.291
That is relative. It was mine,
but only because you gave it to me.

11:44.875 --> 11:47.791
Before it belonged to the company
that made it and now it belongs to Alex.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.083
Sorry?

11:50.208 --> 11:53.041
Attachment to things
only brings suffering, mom.

11:53.791 --> 11:55.750
Where did you get that, my love?

11:55.833 --> 11:57.666
From the podcast...

11:58.291 --> 11:59.875
"The death of the soul".

12:00.583 --> 12:02.541
By Pepe Mari Manzanares.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.208
Why are you talking like that, Puppy?

12:05.291 --> 12:07.916
Damn, mom.
Because the podcast is from Spain.

12:08.208 --> 12:09.791
You don't understand anything, gosh.

12:20.458 --> 12:22.875
He stole Bubbles
from our daughter.

12:22.958 --> 12:25.208
Moms have to be careful.
Always attentive.

12:25.291 --> 12:27.541
I'm not saying
Daniela is a bad mom.

12:27.625 --> 12:29.958
On the contrary,
I think she is a good mom.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.375
What do you think of her?

12:33.666 --> 12:35.708
Did you happen to talk
to her today?

12:36.583 --> 12:37.708
Aha.

12:39.416 --> 12:40.750
What did you talk about?

12:43.458 --> 12:46.041
I asked her
about that bitcoin thing,

12:46.125 --> 12:48.125
if now it was a good idea
to invest.

12:48.208 --> 12:50.083
Pig, no.
That's Julia, the blonde.

12:50.166 --> 12:53.208
I'm talking about the other one,
Daniela, very plain.

12:53.291 --> 12:55.708
The mother of the grant ginger,
the average woman.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.333
Aha.

12:59.333 --> 13:00.791
Did you talk to her then?

13:04.416 --> 13:06.625
Luna and the others say that...

13:07.583 --> 13:08.916
... that she is pretty.

13:09.666 --> 13:12.625
Maybe. Maybe she is attractive.
What do you think?

13:14.083 --> 13:15.791
Pig. What do you think?

13:16.666 --> 13:19.041
Does she seem pretty, attractive to you?

13:20.375 --> 13:21.833
Yes, she can be.

13:21.958 --> 13:23.958
Can be what?
Pretty or attractive?

13:25.250 --> 13:27.041
I do not know, my love.
She seems...

13:28.541 --> 13:29.625
... nice.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.541
Nice what?
Nice to look at or nice...

13:32.625 --> 13:34.625
-...psychologically speaking.
-Yes, that.

13:34.708 --> 13:37.041
What then?
Pick one option.

13:37.125 --> 13:39.458
Either one, my love.
I do not care.

13:39.541 --> 13:41.708
Let me finish answering this email.

13:49.791 --> 13:52.875
Mommies,
we have to address a high-impact topic.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.250
I'm talking about Alex
and his illegal gambling business.

13:56.458 --> 13:59.958
You know that yesterday
he took Bubbles from my poor Puppy.

14:00.041 --> 14:03.041
Bubbles is snuggle pal
for sweet dreams. Poor thing.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.083
He also kept a quartz from my Inti.

14:05.166 --> 14:07.791
And Juan de Dios' rosary
blessed by the Pope.

14:08.291 --> 14:12.041
He took $100 from James
and a GPS smartwatch from my son.

14:12.125 --> 14:15.500
But he did me a great favor,
with my Dante we are with STRT.

14:16.416 --> 14:18.875
-TTTT?
-Oh, what a pity!

14:18.958 --> 14:20.625
I hope you get better soon.

14:21.166 --> 14:23.458
It's not a disease, STRT.

14:23.625 --> 14:24.791
Kidney trauma?

14:24.875 --> 14:26.833
Screen time reduction therapy.

14:26.916 --> 14:27.958
What's that?

14:28.041 --> 14:30.041
A therapy to control the minutes

14:30.125 --> 14:32.291
we can spend on electronic devices.

14:32.375 --> 14:34.333
In fact, I'm going to be
cut off at any moment.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.958
Well, Julia, but not all of us
are millionaires like you.

14:37.250 --> 14:40.041
-It hurts some of us to be robbed.
-That boy is not a thief.

14:40.125 --> 14:43.416
He is an entrepreneur. He saw
the opportunity and closed the deal.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.333
-We should congratulate him.
-We should report him.

14:46.416 --> 14:47.166
You do it.

14:47.250 --> 14:48.875
As part of the selection committee

14:48.958 --> 14:51.458
for the Clarita Arts
and Sciences grant.

14:51.541 --> 14:53.458
-What happened to me?
-Nothing, Clarita.

14:54.083 --> 14:58.041
I assure you
that he has no history of misconduct.

14:58.208 --> 14:59.375
Ha!

14:59.458 --> 15:01.416
But if the children didn't mind,

15:01.666 --> 15:03.541
why are we going to get involved?

15:03.625 --> 15:05.541
Those Adult centric ideas
are not good.

15:05.625 --> 15:08.791
It is better that they solve
their conflicts alone.

15:08.875 --> 15:12.208
If we let this go on like this,
what will we be robbed of tomorrow?

15:13.250 --> 15:15.416
And what do you want to do?
A bingo?

15:15.750 --> 15:18.083
A raffle?
A food and beverage party?

15:18.250 --> 15:20.041
We have to talk to Daniela.

15:24.208 --> 15:25.416
I understand.

15:25.666 --> 15:27.250
Nobody has the guts.

15:27.583 --> 15:31.000
Well, as usual, the President is going
to have to save the day. You are welcome.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.833
Don't take your eyes off your backpack.
Okay? Here is an inventory

15:35.916 --> 15:38.500
with all the things you carry
and you check it before leaving

15:38.583 --> 15:41.000
and then we check it at home because
no one can be trusted anymore. Here.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.375
If that gives you
a false sense of control

15:43.458 --> 15:46.833
and helps you ease your anxiety over
the randomness of existence.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.041
What are you talking about,
my love? Come on.

15:50.125 --> 15:54.208
From the podcast "Cosmic Depression"
by Pepe Mari Manzanares.

15:56.083 --> 15:58.333
Ok.
Yeah, cheer up.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.541
Have a wonderful day and please,
I beg you,

16:00.625 --> 16:03.416
take off that horrible bangs,
you look like a memo girl.

16:03.958 --> 16:06.041
-Emo.
-Oh, no! How awful!

16:07.708 --> 16:08.791
Okay.

16:08.958 --> 16:11.333
Daniela,
if your child has long fingers,

16:11.500 --> 16:15.083
-that hurts my daughter, because...
-Trini, did you talk to Daniela?

16:17.166 --> 16:19.833
Do you have a speech
and are you rehearsing it?

16:20.625 --> 16:23.625
You have a speech
and you are rehearsing it. What stress.

16:23.708 --> 16:24.750
I'm not rehearsing.

16:24.833 --> 16:27.375
It will be a totally
organic conversation, that's it.

16:27.458 --> 16:31.458
If your son is a friend of the student,
then that will imply...

16:31.791 --> 16:34.291
-What happens?
-...that your son is going to be...

16:34.750 --> 16:36.375
She is rehearsing her speech.

16:36.458 --> 16:38.875
I'm not rehearsing anything.
Come on, Luna.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.958
-Your son...
-Has she already given the speech?

16:41.041 --> 16:43.041
-Not yet.
-But she has a speech?

16:43.125 --> 16:44.958
Yes, and she is willing to use it.

16:45.041 --> 16:46.625
Okay. I know this story,

16:46.708 --> 16:48.875
I'm leaving, because I have
a very important meeting...

16:48.958 --> 16:52.875
-Why do you use an organizer?
-Because we are with STRT.

16:52.958 --> 16:56.250
Oh, don't be stupid.
I told you it's not a disease.

16:56.500 --> 17:00.166
The organizer helps me
reduce screen time. That is all.

17:00.625 --> 17:02.750
-Hello!
-Daniela.

17:03.791 --> 17:05.625
-My dear, there are moments in life...
-It started.

17:05.708 --> 17:07.290
-I have a yoga class. Namastë.
-Okay, bye!

17:07.375 --> 17:09.375
-One has to...
-No, no, please, don't go.

17:09.915 --> 17:11.750
I want to apologize to you.

17:13.665 --> 17:14.790
You have five minutes.

17:16.083 --> 17:18.790
Last night, when we got home
with Alex, I saw that...

17:19.833 --> 17:22.708
... he had brought some things
from his classmates and...

17:23.125 --> 17:26.375
...well, we're so sorry.
It's not something I taught him.

17:26.875 --> 17:27.958
Of course.

17:28.583 --> 17:31.041
Yeah, well,
sometimes it happens. No?

17:31.166 --> 17:33.333
If you're going
to blame someone, blame me.

17:33.416 --> 17:36.791
Because he has had a very difficult
year with the death of his father,

17:37.208 --> 17:39.125
moving to a new house, a new city.

17:39.250 --> 17:42.541
I have never really been able
to buy a lot of things for him.

17:42.625 --> 17:46.291
I haven't had the money,
but he's a cute boy.

17:46.458 --> 17:48.750
Don't judge him
before you meet him, please.

17:48.875 --> 17:49.875
Of course.

17:49.958 --> 17:50.958
-Poor dear.
-Okay.

17:51.041 --> 17:54.041
-Okay.
-Oh, Bubbles!

17:55.375 --> 17:57.083
That is...

17:57.625 --> 17:59.291
No, no...

17:59.791 --> 18:02.125
... this quartz has a very nice energy.

18:02.541 --> 18:06.166
-It will do you and your son good.
-Really? Thanks.

18:06.750 --> 18:09.333
I also found the rosary.

18:09.416 --> 18:11.041
Oh, no! No!

18:11.916 --> 18:14.500
Give it to Alex,
to pray every night

18:14.583 --> 18:16.666
and meet our Lord Jesus Christ.

18:16.750 --> 18:17.791
Thanks.

18:18.333 --> 18:21.083
And your babysitter's money
and the watch.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.875
No, keep everything.
James's money doesn't matter.

18:23.958 --> 18:26.166
-I pay him quite well.
-Sure?

18:26.250 --> 18:28.541
And that watch is better suited
for your son than mine.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.875
Also, with my Dante
we are in STRT.

18:30.958 --> 18:32.708
It is not a contagious disease.

18:32.791 --> 18:36.375
Yeah, screen time reduction therapy.
Yes, yes, I've heard it.

18:36.458 --> 18:39.041
-Thank you very much. Really.
-It has GPS.

18:40.125 --> 18:42.666
You will always know
where your son is.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.916
Aren't you going to say anything, Trini?

18:47.708 --> 18:48.750
Uh? Nope.

18:48.833 --> 18:50.375
Well, I wanted

18:50.583 --> 18:54.166
to invite you to my house for dinner.
Would you like to?

18:54.958 --> 18:58.458
I imagine you are super busy,
but I really want to thank you

18:58.541 --> 19:00.208
for everything you've done
for me and my Alex.

19:00.291 --> 19:02.458
Thank you very much.
But the truth is, I don't think we can.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.416
-I can. Yes
-Yes? Oh, that's good!

19:04.500 --> 19:05.791
Yes, but Clarita
isn't here to ask her.

19:05.875 --> 19:08.875
I met her at the inspector' office
and she said yes, she can.

19:08.958 --> 19:10.958
We will be there,
won't we, Trinidad?

19:15.166 --> 19:16.541
Is this one, jump.

19:16.625 --> 19:18.291
-Don't leave me without an umbrella.
-Jump!

19:18.500 --> 19:21.000
Hey, you left me without an umbrella.

19:21.083 --> 19:23.083
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.
-I don't like getting my hair wet.

19:23.166 --> 19:25.625
-Be careful with the cake.
-No, I bring it well covered.

19:25.708 --> 19:28.375
-Here it is? Oh, yeah.
-Here, here.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.541
Hello, hello!

19:29.958 --> 19:32.291
Pig, put the cakes
in the lunch box

19:32.375 --> 19:34.750
tomorrow they have
shared snack, please.

19:35.166 --> 19:37.250
Hey, how cute is this house!

19:37.333 --> 19:39.958
It is the most interesting thing
there is. It is like...

19:40.166 --> 19:41.166
Like...

19:41.666 --> 19:42.708
Authentic.

19:43.291 --> 19:45.958
-Simple.
-It's like a granny's house.

19:46.708 --> 19:47.875
Vintage.

19:48.208 --> 19:51.291
I would throw it all away!
It is a possible good investment.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.583
-Julia! Come on.
-It is true.

19:54.625 --> 19:56.541
Please, I would like to ask you
to speak quietly,

19:56.666 --> 19:58.458
my aunt Agustina is sleeping.

19:59.083 --> 20:01.458
-Is she visiting?
-No, this is her house.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.291
She has senile dementia.

20:03.375 --> 20:05.541
And I am taking care of her
in her last days.

20:06.625 --> 20:08.791
-And who inherits it? You?
-Huh?

20:09.583 --> 20:10.791
No.

20:11.041 --> 20:13.708
The real estate market is very dynamic.

20:13.833 --> 20:17.291
They tear all this down
and build a big strip center.

20:17.375 --> 20:19.041
-Mall.
-Yes.

20:19.250 --> 20:20.291
Julia!

20:20.375 --> 20:23.083
We can do business
when your aunt dies. Right?

20:23.541 --> 20:25.541
The thing is, she's donating it
all to the church.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.291
Because she is very religious.

20:27.375 --> 20:29.208
-How nice!
-Another one.

20:29.291 --> 20:33.166
Like my blessed mother,
may she rest in peace. She donated it all.

20:35.250 --> 20:37.541
Sometimes it's really exhausting
to take care of her,

20:37.625 --> 20:39.041
but I'm very grateful

20:39.125 --> 20:41.958
since she gave me
a space in her house to live.

20:43.291 --> 20:45.208
Well, chocolates to sweeten your life.

20:45.291 --> 20:46.291
Thanks.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.208
-A candle to light it up.
-Oh, how nice!

20:48.291 --> 20:50.208
I made you a cake.
It didn't raise

20:50.291 --> 20:53.416
-but the intention is what counts.
-Oh yeah. How nice!

20:54.083 --> 20:57.583
I brought you an image
of the guardian angel.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.958
-Do you know the pray?
-Of course, yes.

21:00.041 --> 21:02.875
-Angel of God, my guardian dear.
-Angel of God, my guardian dear.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.458
ever this day be at my side
to light and guard,

21:04.541 --> 21:06.208
-to rule and guide
-With God I go to sleep,

21:06.291 --> 21:08.166
with God I wake up,
and the grace of the Holy Spirit.

21:08.750 --> 21:12.083
No, this whiskey is for me.
I assumed you hadn't.

21:12.750 --> 21:14.291
No, I didn't.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.541
-I knew it.
-Okay, let's go.

21:16.791 --> 21:18.750
Over there.
Yes, to the dining room.

21:18.916 --> 21:19.958
Excuse.

21:20.041 --> 21:21.291
Piggy, what snack?

21:21.375 --> 21:24.458
And we were so in love,
we couldn't stop looking at each other.

21:25.500 --> 21:28.333
And two months after we got married,
Alex arrived.

21:28.458 --> 21:30.541
Oh, such blessing.

21:30.791 --> 21:33.333
It is a miracle that the Lord
has brought your paths together.

21:33.416 --> 21:34.666
Where is the lunch box?

21:34.750 --> 21:37.958
Pig, the lunch box has been on
the same shelf for five years, please.

21:38.041 --> 21:39.333
Stop it, Trini.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.791
Excuse me, is that him?

21:42.875 --> 21:44.541
Yes, it's him.

21:44.875 --> 21:47.375
Such tenderness
and what a great sorrow too.

21:48.250 --> 21:50.625
-How long ago did he die?
-Trinidad!

21:50.833 --> 21:52.375
It doesn't matter.
It's ok.

21:52.583 --> 21:54.000
Two years ago already.

21:54.583 --> 21:56.708
He was a fireman,

21:57.166 --> 22:00.291
and one day there was
a giant fire in the village.

22:00.375 --> 22:02.791
And he went in
to save a granny in a house.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.500
And he burned to death
with the granny?

22:04.583 --> 22:06.416
Oh, what a sordid question, please!

22:06.500 --> 22:08.458
No, what happens
is that he inhaled toxic gases

22:08.541 --> 22:12.458
and that caused him
a degenerative lung disease.

22:12.750 --> 22:14.666
They gave him six months to live,

22:14.750 --> 22:17.250
but he spent two years fighting.

22:20.250 --> 22:22.833
And he died here, in my arms.

22:26.291 --> 22:28.041
His last words were

22:28.791 --> 22:32.833
"Life will always be too short
with you by my side."

22:34.750 --> 22:36.708
Yeah, but how many meters
did you say the house was?

22:36.791 --> 22:38.208
-Julia.
-No, no, it's just that I was thinking,

22:38.291 --> 22:40.208
the other option
is to throw down the walls

22:40.291 --> 22:42.958
-and we build a Co-work place.
-Joint work.

22:43.041 --> 22:44.750
Ah, nothing can be said.

22:44.833 --> 22:45.875
Sorry...

22:46.125 --> 22:49.333
But why were there toxic gases
in the burning house?

22:50.333 --> 22:52.708
No, it was a factory,
not a house.

22:52.791 --> 22:54.208
But wasn't it a village?

22:54.291 --> 22:56.166
Yes, a factory in a village.

22:56.958 --> 22:59.958
Factories are the cancer
of the planet.

23:01.166 --> 23:03.000
-And why was the granny in the factory?
-Trinidad.

23:03.083 --> 23:06.250
I don't know. I have no idea,
but if I can tell you something

23:07.541 --> 23:09.666
I miss him every day of my life.

23:13.291 --> 23:16.041
Let's take a selfie?
To keep this moment.

23:16.125 --> 23:17.125
Ok!

23:17.208 --> 23:18.708
With Julia's phone, is more modern.

23:18.791 --> 23:21.750
No, no, my psychiatrist gave me
this old cell phone, is useless.

23:21.833 --> 23:22.833
It does not even ring.

23:22.916 --> 23:25.833
Here, I found it.
Ok, say "Mommies."

23:27.416 --> 23:29.208
Mommies!

23:30.916 --> 23:32.958
A spider!
Mom I have a spider!

23:33.041 --> 23:35.458
Oh, Lord!
But what's wrong with you by god?

23:35.541 --> 23:37.791
Calm down!
You are going to wake up my aunt.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.666
Son, look, look.
It is just a fluff.

23:40.750 --> 23:42.208
Look, did you see?

23:42.625 --> 23:44.750
-Are you sure I don't have anything?
-Sure.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.708
Excuse me. But he has
a phobia of spiders.

23:47.791 --> 23:50.958
When he was two years old,
a giant spider went into his crib.

23:51.250 --> 23:52.458
Oh, poor thing.

23:52.583 --> 23:54.000
Calm down, my love.

23:54.083 --> 23:56.333
Also, you know,
there is a very nice story

23:56.458 --> 23:58.708
of a very famous superhero
who had such a thing happen to him.

23:58.791 --> 24:00.458
Yes. Aquaman.

24:02.166 --> 24:04.041
Clarita. Come on.

24:04.250 --> 24:05.708
I think it's time to go.

24:05.791 --> 24:07.208
-Ok.
-There is nothing. Look.

24:07.291 --> 24:09.458
I even lost my munchies
with the scare.

24:09.541 --> 24:11.208
Good thing,
because you've eaten like...

24:11.291 --> 24:13.708
Hey, didn't you find the story
a little weird?

24:13.791 --> 24:16.500
Yes. Aquaman
wasn't afraid of spiders.

24:16.791 --> 24:18.458
No, the husband's.

24:18.541 --> 24:20.708
Please have a little respect
for the dead.

24:20.958 --> 24:22.958
The deceased

24:23.208 --> 24:25.958
or people who transcend
to other dimensions.

24:26.500 --> 24:28.541
It seemed weird to me too.

24:29.125 --> 24:31.708
Have you seen the lunchtime soap opera?
The one with the doctors?

24:31.791 --> 24:32.666
No.

24:32.750 --> 24:34.250
Look, the only weird thing here

24:34.333 --> 24:37.708
is how this poor woman,
who has suffered so much, stands tall.

24:37.791 --> 24:40.375
So, please,
let's stop this discussion here.

24:42.625 --> 24:44.875
Cover me, please, my hair
gets frizzy in the rain. I hate it.

24:44.958 --> 24:46.333
-I cover you.
-Cover me!

24:46.416 --> 24:48.250
-I hate getting my hair wet.
-I already got wet.

24:48.375 --> 24:50.750
-Be careful with the pools.
-Everything was nice! Right?

24:51.250 --> 24:52.250
Loving.

24:57.875 --> 24:59.708
Why are you reading that book?

25:00.458 --> 25:02.458
I have read this four times already.

25:02.541 --> 25:05.375
You could have told me and I would
have sent you an autographed copy.

25:06.250 --> 25:08.291
What? Is it you?

25:08.375 --> 25:11.708
And they will know that I am the Lord

25:11.916 --> 25:15.208
when I bring my vengeance upon them

25:15.458 --> 25:18.791
-and I will execute against them...
-This is my favorite verse.

25:18.875 --> 25:20.208
...great revenges...

25:20.291 --> 25:22.750
I didn't know
you were so religious.

25:22.833 --> 25:25.208
-Of course.
-May the body and blood of your son

25:25.291 --> 25:28.458
I could not live my life without giving
myself into the hands of the Lord.

25:29.416 --> 25:33.208
I have not practiced yoga
since my life partner left this plane.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.625
Ah, it shows in your aura

25:35.833 --> 25:38.208
that you have worked hard
to heal yourself.

25:38.750 --> 25:41.708
And tantric sex has helped me
so much to energize myself.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.708
Between us, I haven't been able
to think of any man

25:45.791 --> 25:47.916
since I bid farewell
to the love of my life.

25:49.291 --> 25:51.041
Oh, so cute.

25:52.041 --> 25:54.916
To keep yourself in abstinence
to the memory of your husband.

25:55.041 --> 25:57.625
-It's a great leap of faith.
-Of course.

25:57.708 --> 25:59.375
As it should be.
Of course,

25:59.458 --> 26:02.000
I have not dared to invest yet
because it scares me a little.

26:02.125 --> 26:05.833
The best thing about cryptos
is they are totally outside the system.

26:06.208 --> 26:08.958
-And they leave no trace.
-And they leave no trace.

26:09.041 --> 26:12.375
Good, my love. You earned
five more minutes of screen time.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.750
-Yes!
-Here it is.

26:14.166 --> 26:16.833
I learned everything
from my teacher Amancay in Chiloé.

26:17.083 --> 26:18.166
Everything.

26:18.791 --> 26:21.625
Amancay?
Do you mean a woman?

26:22.166 --> 26:25.291
There are not many men
who practice tantric sex in Mechuque.

26:26.583 --> 26:27.833
But women, yes.

26:28.291 --> 26:30.333
It is amazing how much you know.

26:30.416 --> 26:32.583
It would be an honor for me
to have you as my teacher.

26:32.666 --> 26:34.833
-I have no time.
-Oh, obviously.

26:34.916 --> 26:38.083
Right. A business woman like you,
a good mother,

26:38.166 --> 26:42.208
hard-working,
intelligent, stylish, gorgeous!

26:42.333 --> 26:43.541
Yeah, well, yeah.

26:44.666 --> 26:48.041
-You have to be open to everything. No?
-Yes, of course.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.583
Are you open to everything?

26:53.208 --> 26:54.625
Of course.

26:56.458 --> 26:57.791
Good to know.

26:57.875 --> 26:59.750
I wanted to ask you to please
not tell anyone,

26:59.875 --> 27:02.833
because I would not like them to think
that I want to take advantage of you.

27:02.916 --> 27:06.541
Don't worry. No one has ever
taken advantage of me.

27:07.166 --> 27:08.500
-Never.
-Of course.

27:10.208 --> 27:12.291
Of course,
I wanted to ask you for discretion,

27:12.833 --> 27:14.958
around here
people are very conservative.

27:16.333 --> 27:18.291
I wanted to ask you for discretion.

27:18.958 --> 27:21.541
People judge a lot
when one is a believer.

27:21.750 --> 27:23.583
You don't know
how much I understand you.

27:24.166 --> 27:25.333
Don't worry.

27:26.958 --> 27:29.333
This is God's Word.

27:29.833 --> 27:32.333
Praise the Lord.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.750
-What time do we meet today?
-At eight.

27:34.958 --> 27:36.875
-Thank you.
-What meeting is at eight?

27:36.958 --> 27:40.708
-I have no messages.
-Sorry, I was in the wrong chat.

27:40.958 --> 27:42.833
This message was for another group.

27:43.958 --> 27:46.208
What do you mean for another group?
Luna answered you.

27:46.375 --> 27:48.291
-What chat is that?
-Another group.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.833
The Single Mommies Party group.

27:50.916 --> 27:53.041
Where is Luna, Julia and I.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.916
Today we are going
to take Daniela to Julia's bar.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.666
Oh, sounds great.
Fantastic.

27:57.750 --> 28:00.708
I'm going to tell Pig
to stay in charge of the ship.

28:00.791 --> 28:03.333
Because today we have girls night.
I'm lovin 'it!

28:05.166 --> 28:07.041
It's just for single mommies.

28:07.166 --> 28:09.583
I don't think Daniela
goes to those things.

28:10.083 --> 28:11.333
She is very devoted.

28:11.458 --> 28:12.833
That's discrimination.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.875
And we in this chat
do not accept discrimination.

28:16.333 --> 28:17.750
Am I invited or not?

28:19.791 --> 28:23.166
-Sorry, sorry. I got confused.
-Oh, Clarita.

28:23.791 --> 28:26.833
-Now what do we tell her?
-Trinidad lowers our stocks.

28:26.916 --> 28:28.541
I would leave her on view.

28:28.625 --> 28:31.416
Do you think that Trinidad is going
to accept that we leave her in seen?

28:31.916 --> 28:33.875
-Yes.
-How lovely. It is full of things.

28:33.958 --> 28:35.500
It is ideal for doing yoga.

28:35.625 --> 28:37.333
Did you see the dishes over there?

28:39.625 --> 28:42.666
Ariela? Ariela!

28:44.791 --> 28:48.541
-You're confusing me with someone else.
-What are you doing in the big city?

28:48.625 --> 28:51.625
-I didn't know you had left Mechuque.
-Yes.

28:52.041 --> 28:54.333
-Go away!
-And how is your husband?

28:54.416 --> 28:55.875
Hey, I miss him so much.

28:55.958 --> 28:57.916
Tell him to call me.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.791
-Ok, thanks! There's the bathroom.
-Have him call me.

29:00.916 --> 29:02.666
-I already went to the bathroom.
-There, look.

29:02.750 --> 29:05.500
Don't push me.
How rude, bye!

29:05.958 --> 29:07.958
-Did you meet a friend?
-Huh?

29:08.333 --> 29:10.625
No, no, he was a drunk.

29:11.875 --> 29:14.208
But didn't he mention
something about Mechuque?

29:14.416 --> 29:16.625
No, no, he told me something like...

29:16.708 --> 29:19.541
...you shook me
or something like that, drunk.

29:20.375 --> 29:23.583
-Dani, here.
-Thanks, shall we go to the dance floor?

29:23.666 --> 29:26.166
Yes, yes. My informant says
that the best prospect

29:26.250 --> 29:28.000
is far away.

29:28.083 --> 29:30.000
I feel so special.

29:30.250 --> 29:33.125
I kind of walked in,
and the second I got dizzy.

29:33.291 --> 29:34.708
Far away.

29:34.791 --> 29:37.208
-Shall we?
-How nice!

29:45.750 --> 29:49.250
Pig, my love, put the wooden spoon
and the sheet of cardboard

29:49.375 --> 29:53.041
or lined cardboard, but the thin one,
in his backpack. Ok, bye.

29:53.916 --> 29:57.416
-Hey, gorgeous, do you want to dance?
-No, no. I'm married.

30:00.208 --> 30:01.500
Thanks.

30:03.916 --> 30:06.666
Pig, my love, I forgot that Sofi
has a shared snack tomorrow.

30:06.750 --> 30:09.958
Please put it in the front pocket
of her backpack. It's in

30:10.083 --> 30:12.291
-the black cabinet in the kitchen.
-Hello.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.083
-Do you want to dance with me?
-I'm married.

30:16.333 --> 30:18.000
-Oh, okay.
-Yes, yes.

30:18.125 --> 30:20.541
No! Without my cell phone,
I am not me.

30:20.666 --> 30:24.125
In fact, I don't know if I'm alive
because there are no notifications.

30:24.208 --> 30:25.291
I have no idea.

30:25.375 --> 30:27.916
-Do you know what my heart rate is?
-No.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.083
No. Do you know how much
oxygen I have in my blood now?

30:31.166 --> 30:32.541
No. To be honest no.

30:32.625 --> 30:34.125
Neither do I.

30:34.208 --> 30:37.208
I have no idea. I don't even know
when my period comes.

30:37.291 --> 30:39.458
Because this fucking
old cell phone,

30:39.541 --> 30:40.875
from 1500 BC,

30:40.958 --> 30:44.250
-does not send notifications.
-It doesn't!

30:44.375 --> 30:48.083
Even the poor! The poor stop eating
to charge their fucking cell phone.

30:48.208 --> 30:50.250
-Look!
-And I am a businesswoman...

30:51.166 --> 30:52.458
And these drinks?

30:52.666 --> 30:54.541
Wow, Trini,
they didn't send you.

30:54.666 --> 30:56.666
What didn't they send me?

30:56.875 --> 31:00.000
They told me for the four of us,
except for the lady.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.958
-But you don't drink, right?
-Of course not!

31:02.083 --> 31:04.000
Well, unless it's a toast.
That's different.

31:04.125 --> 31:08.208
Oh, no! This song sets
all my chakras on fire. Let's Dance.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.708
Let's go!

31:15.791 --> 31:18.875
Hey, leave the bag,
don't be a peasant.

31:19.041 --> 31:22.458
Leave it here. Trini can take care of it,
because no one ask her to dance.

31:22.541 --> 31:24.000
Sure?
Thank you!

32:04.166 --> 32:05.625
Daniela.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.291
Mariela?

32:11.750 --> 32:13.500
Ariela?

32:22.833 --> 32:23.791
Hello.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.791
-Ouch!
-You got nervous.

32:26.958 --> 32:28.791
-Excuse me.
-How are you?

32:29.041 --> 32:30.791
I am married.
I am very married.

32:30.875 --> 32:33.708
And I'm also very injured.
So, I'm not good at dancing

32:33.875 --> 32:36.333
-not at all. So, goodbye.
-Your lost.

32:36.416 --> 32:38.833
Oh, what a pity.
What a shame to miss it.

32:47.208 --> 32:50.166
-You dropped it.
-Oh, I dropped it! Yeah.

32:50.250 --> 32:52.750
A very insistent guy came
and he wanted to dance with me.

32:52.833 --> 32:55.291
-He said he knew me.
-Yes?

32:55.416 --> 32:57.291
Curious, huh?

32:59.041 --> 33:01.333
Seems like that happens a lot
around here.

33:05.791 --> 33:07.083
Dude! Another one.

33:09.833 --> 33:11.458
More ice water.

33:15.250 --> 33:17.625
What happened now?
Moral hangover?

33:18.500 --> 33:21.291
-What are we doing here?
-Where is Clarita?

33:21.375 --> 33:23.541
-Hi, Mommies.
-Oh Clarita, you scared me!

33:23.625 --> 33:25.833
Well, Clarita was kind enough
to lend us this room

33:25.916 --> 33:27.750
so we could talk in peace.

33:27.916 --> 33:30.875
I have to tune all the instruments
before the music class starts.

33:30.958 --> 33:33.416
-Thank you very much.
-But what happened?

33:35.041 --> 33:36.791
It's Daniela.

33:37.416 --> 33:38.666
She hides something.

33:43.958 --> 33:46.625
-Pretend I'm not here.
-It's what we always do.

33:49.125 --> 33:51.958
Last night when we went dancing,

33:52.083 --> 33:54.125
well, I didn't dance,
although I did get asked a lot.

33:54.250 --> 33:57.583
I saw myself in the obligation
to look at Daniela's bag.

33:59.291 --> 34:00.708
Daniela has...

34:02.750 --> 34:05.333
...three identity cards.

34:06.041 --> 34:09.291
All with different names
and with different photographs.

34:10.500 --> 34:12.750
-Come on, Clarita, leave it!
-What happened?

34:13.083 --> 34:15.791
-I just can't believe it.
-Wild, right? Neither do I.

34:15.916 --> 34:18.291
Did you check Daniela's bag?

34:18.916 --> 34:21.916
That's worse than stealing.
It is a deadly sin.

34:22.125 --> 34:23.500
Thou shalt not steal.

34:24.041 --> 34:27.041
-And you are sure of all this?
-I'm absolutely sure.

34:27.166 --> 34:31.291
Look, one of them had the name Ariela
and the other one Maria,

34:31.416 --> 34:34.916
-or something similar. Mariel...
-You don't even remember.

34:35.125 --> 34:37.916
-Of course I remember.
- You had a lot to drinks last night.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.708
And besides, it was all so dark
you can't see anything, Trini.

34:41.833 --> 34:43.416
-Yes, that's right.
-First, I don't drink.

34:43.541 --> 34:46.833
I drink alcohol only for toasts.
And I am totally sure of what I say.

34:46.916 --> 34:49.333
Can we all have
the same conversation, please?

34:49.416 --> 34:52.375
My head hurts.
She' s talking about false identities.

34:52.500 --> 34:54.541
-Serious, very serious.
-Look, Trinidad.

34:55.250 --> 34:57.500
We know that you don't like Daniela.

34:58.250 --> 35:00.458
But to invent such a thing, by God!

35:00.541 --> 35:03.541
-I'm not making it up, Milagros.
-Do you have any evidence?

35:06.083 --> 35:08.833
Oh, sorry, sorry, Clarita.
No, I do not have.

35:09.416 --> 35:12.416
Well then, Namastë.

35:12.875 --> 35:15.958
-No, no namastë. Luna. Luna!
-Get some,

35:16.083 --> 35:19.666
-without evidence, there's no crime.
-Julia, this is serious.

35:21.666 --> 35:22.916
Amen.

35:28.875 --> 35:29.875
Sorry.

35:31.875 --> 35:33.208
-Wow. Very good, huh?
-Yes.

35:33.333 --> 35:34.375
Very different!

35:36.166 --> 35:38.666
-Very intense. Very intense.
-Yes.

35:38.750 --> 35:40.958
Are you sure
you've never danced before?

35:41.291 --> 35:44.500
-True. I swear.
-It's just you're so good.

35:45.958 --> 35:47.791
-To dance, very good.
-Oooh!

35:47.916 --> 35:51.500
No, no, no, Father.
You are very good at dancing.

35:51.625 --> 35:54.166
-You are very good at dancing.
-Thank you.

35:55.125 --> 35:58.458
Well, Father, as always,
we are very grateful for your time.

35:58.541 --> 36:01.291
-It is only the will of the Lord.
-Let's go!

36:01.583 --> 36:05.125
-Bye. No! We can't go.
-But Milagros offered me a ride.

36:05.708 --> 36:08.125
-It is not possible now.
-Why not?

36:08.291 --> 36:12.166
Because today we are going
to give Daniela a nice welcome.

36:12.250 --> 36:14.458
Bravo! Clap, clap, clap, clap.

36:14.625 --> 36:17.500
-Thanks for considering me.
-No, no, no, no, Father.

36:17.708 --> 36:19.958
Girls only.
Girls just wanna have fun.

36:20.208 --> 36:22.958
The conclave of virgins.
Blessings.

36:23.291 --> 36:25.250
-Bye! See you tomorrow.
-Bye, Father!

36:25.375 --> 36:27.000
I'm leaving.
I have to work. Bye, bye.

36:27.083 --> 36:29.500
No, no, Julia.
It is the welcome rite.

36:30.875 --> 36:35.166
Daniela, I imagine you have noticed
that we are a very united

36:35.250 --> 36:37.666
-and unbreakable group.
-Yes, yes.

36:37.833 --> 36:39.625
Do you know what the basis
of our strength is?

36:39.791 --> 36:41.791
-What?
-Our exclusive WhatsApp group.

36:42.083 --> 36:45.250
Right, Mommies?
And we have thought that, well,

36:45.333 --> 36:48.916
you deserve to be part
of our sisterhood.

36:49.416 --> 36:51.791
-Oh, thanks!
-Yes. The cutest thing there is.

36:51.916 --> 36:56.125
So, in order for you to be a real
SOS MAMIS, we customarily

36:56.208 --> 36:58.750
-do an initiation ritual.
-Yes?

36:58.833 --> 37:03.291
Oh, I love rituals,
but what ritual?

37:03.375 --> 37:04.500
The ritual.

37:05.291 --> 37:06.833
Absolute trust.

37:07.708 --> 37:09.125
In a woman's purse

37:09.791 --> 37:11.791
is where all her secrets
are kept. Right?

37:12.833 --> 37:14.458
And in this group,

37:15.666 --> 37:17.583
-we have no secrets.
-No.

37:24.208 --> 37:27.083
-Right, Julia?
-Right. The ritual.

37:27.291 --> 37:30.208
Of course, Mommies, react!
We have all done it.

37:41.708 --> 37:43.458
And what are these?

37:43.875 --> 37:46.166
These are the pills
the doctor gave me.

37:46.708 --> 37:49.416
I take this in the morning
when I can't get up.

37:49.500 --> 37:52.166
And this when I feel a thing,
here, like this.

37:52.291 --> 37:54.125
And these are my pills to be happy.

37:54.208 --> 37:56.958
I take these when I can't eat.

37:57.166 --> 37:59.375
And these, at night,
when I can't sleep.

37:59.541 --> 38:01.708
Okay. Very healthy.
Come on, Julia, now you.

38:02.291 --> 38:03.291
Me?

38:08.791 --> 38:10.875
Wow, how beautiful is this color!

38:11.458 --> 38:14.625
-It is moving.
-It's my Brad Pitt.

38:14.875 --> 38:16.250
Don't play stupid.

38:18.875 --> 38:22.791
Oh! Put that away please.
I don't want to go to jail again.

38:22.875 --> 38:26.000
-No, it's mine.
-It's a ritual, you have to participate.

38:26.083 --> 38:27.916
We have all participated.
The end.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
There.
Easy as that. Done.

38:30.125 --> 38:33.833
-Be careful, you're going to burn.
-...I swear they are ideal...

38:34.666 --> 38:35.791
Give me that!

38:35.875 --> 38:38.708
Hey, why do you have a photo
from the Ghost movie?

38:38.791 --> 38:41.208
Starring Millie and Father Anthony.

38:41.291 --> 38:45.000
No, no, it's a souvenir
from the Pomaire retreat.

38:45.875 --> 38:47.916
You know what?
Give me that.

38:48.250 --> 38:50.625
I don't have to explain myself to anyone.

38:50.750 --> 38:53.500
This is a memory of a spiritual journey

38:54.125 --> 38:55.750
where we meet the Lord.

38:55.958 --> 38:57.208
What Lord?

38:57.375 --> 38:59.000
Mystery of Pomaire solved.

39:00.333 --> 39:04.750
-Okay. It's your turn, Daniela.
-Me?

39:06.041 --> 39:07.791
Unless you have something to hide.

39:18.958 --> 39:19.958
There.

39:21.958 --> 39:25.708
-Aha! What do we have here?
-My documents.

39:26.333 --> 39:27.708
Documents?

39:30.333 --> 39:31.333
Yes.

39:31.583 --> 39:33.041
But where are the others?

39:33.166 --> 39:34.458
-Others?
-Where are the others?

39:34.541 --> 39:36.416
It is the same wallet,
but it is not the same content.

39:36.541 --> 39:37.708
Where are the others,
where are you hiding them?

39:37.791 --> 39:40.625
-What?
-What are you hiding? Where are they?

39:40.708 --> 39:43.208
-In another bag?
-Yeah, yeah. Trinidad, enough.

39:43.291 --> 39:46.375
-Thank you.
-We already did the ritual. Happy?

39:48.708 --> 39:50.583
-My god, frankly.
-Thank you.

39:50.791 --> 39:51.791
Bye.

39:52.083 --> 39:53.625
-Do I help you?
-Thank you.

39:56.625 --> 39:58.833
-We better let's go.
-Let's go.

39:59.083 --> 40:00.500
Happy?

40:01.208 --> 40:04.375
Now, Dani, nevermind.
It's just Trini.

40:04.666 --> 40:06.416
She gets a little silly.

40:11.916 --> 40:14.666
-I can't find the keys to my house.
-Oh, Clarita, please!

40:14.750 --> 40:17.375
I lost them when I turned
my purse upside down.

40:20.583 --> 40:22.458
I don't understand
why no one believes me.

40:22.541 --> 40:24.000
Daniela is hiding something.

40:24.458 --> 40:26.500
You know what I was thinking
the other day?

40:26.708 --> 40:29.916
It is as if Daniela's life
had served as inspiration

40:30.000 --> 40:32.083
-for the soap opera.
-What soap opera?

40:32.291 --> 40:34.083
The one at lunchtime,
"Amor y dolor."

40:34.250 --> 40:35.833
Oh, it keeps me company.

40:35.916 --> 40:38.333
Look,
that firefighter husband story she told,

40:38.541 --> 40:41.958
is the same, exactly the same
as the story of an episode.

40:42.708 --> 40:43.708
Look.

40:48.958 --> 40:53.041
My husband, may he rest in peace,
he inhaled toxic gases

40:53.125 --> 40:54.708
in the smoke from the fire.

40:55.208 --> 40:59.208
Which caused a strong
degenerative disease in his lungs.

41:00.500 --> 41:03.333
They gave him six months to live.

41:04.458 --> 41:07.833
Still, he fought for two years.

41:08.250 --> 41:09.958
He died in my arms.

41:10.333 --> 41:12.416
His last words were

41:13.291 --> 41:16.958
"Life will always be too short

41:17.875 --> 41:19.416
with you by my side."

41:19.708 --> 41:23.500
I miss him.
I miss him so much!

41:25.666 --> 41:27.500
-What's that?
-What are you watching?

41:27.583 --> 41:29.375
I met my screen quota today.

41:29.458 --> 41:32.166
You see? It's exactly
the same story

41:32.250 --> 41:34.791
Daniela told us about her husband,
the firefighter, how he died.

41:34.916 --> 41:38.000
-She copied it from here!
-Oh, that episode is so,

41:38.125 --> 41:40.791
-so good.
-I was a little drunk that night.

41:40.875 --> 41:43.875
-I do not remember anything.
-I was a little high too.

41:46.083 --> 41:48.125
But the energies of the universe

41:48.208 --> 41:51.958
can generate such coincidences
when the stars align.

41:52.541 --> 41:53.750
It's nothing weird.

41:54.416 --> 41:56.541
We call it...

41:59.291 --> 42:00.375
... synchrony.

42:00.458 --> 42:02.333
I agree with what Luna says.

42:02.416 --> 42:06.416
You know? The same thing happened
to me once, in a episode of ALF.

42:06.500 --> 42:09.291
But Clarita,
you said it was the same.

42:09.416 --> 42:11.750
Yes,
but on second thought,

42:12.041 --> 42:14.125
the actress was dressed differently

42:14.458 --> 42:16.333
and besides,
she was speaking Mexican.

42:16.458 --> 42:18.750
-Done!
-Are we done yet?

42:19.750 --> 42:21.708
I have to feed my blessings.

42:21.791 --> 42:23.958
No, Puppy. The shower
is with hair wash too.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.583
Wait, please wait.

42:25.666 --> 42:27.458
-Take a good look at it.
-Look, Trinidad.

42:27.625 --> 42:29.958
I think the best for everyone

42:30.583 --> 42:32.958
is that we leave Daniela
alone with her pain.

42:33.083 --> 42:34.875
But look at the amount of coincidences.

42:34.958 --> 42:36.750
It's exactly the same sto...
Milag...!

42:36.833 --> 42:38.791
-Bye!
-No!

42:38.875 --> 42:42.291
-Your minutes are up for today.
-Oops.

42:42.375 --> 42:43.666
This meeting has ended.

42:44.625 --> 42:47.250
-I'll wash it tomorrow!
-Wash your hair, Sofia!

42:47.375 --> 42:48.500
Wash it!

42:49.375 --> 42:52.541
You see?
It is exactly the same.

42:52.666 --> 42:54.250
Sometimes I feel
like I'm going crazy.

42:54.333 --> 42:55.375
Did Sofi wash her hair?

42:55.916 --> 42:56.958
Aha...

42:57.291 --> 42:59.958
I feel like I talk, talk, and talk,
and no one listens to me.

43:00.083 --> 43:02.416
Sometimes I even have doubts
whether I saw the IDs correctly.

43:02.500 --> 43:05.250
Or if this soap opera, maybe,
is what they call synchrony.

43:06.458 --> 43:07.458
Aha...

43:07.958 --> 43:09.833
I sense it,
really, I sense it.

43:09.916 --> 43:13.166
I sense that this girl, Daniela,
is not who she says she is.

43:13.333 --> 43:15.041
That's why I feel angry,
because...

43:15.125 --> 43:17.416
I know that you are a man,
men do not intuit anything, but...

43:17.500 --> 43:20.250
...but Milagros, the others,
are women, they have intuition.

43:20.375 --> 43:23.833
-How do they not realize? Don't you think?
-Something I do not understand...

43:24.125 --> 43:25.958
Why, if he has amnesia,

43:26.708 --> 43:28.333
he's still in love with her?

43:29.041 --> 43:31.125
Pig, I am asking you for help, my love.

43:31.416 --> 43:33.083
If I'm helping you, love.

43:33.291 --> 43:35.500
You asked me to watch this carefully.

43:37.125 --> 43:38.500
Carefully...

43:38.916 --> 43:40.625
Of course, Pig, my love.

43:40.708 --> 43:44.333
I have not seen things carefully.
I haven't looked closely.

43:44.416 --> 43:47.250
I haven't paid attention to the details.
And in the details is where

43:47.375 --> 43:48.875
the answer is always, my love.

43:48.958 --> 43:51.791
-Let's see.
-...with the man who ruined you.

43:51.875 --> 43:53.916
-With who?
-With Felipe Carmona del Real.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.291
San Felipe school?

43:55.375 --> 43:57.458
-No, not with him.
-It's Felipe!

43:57.583 --> 44:00.833
No! San Felipe, my love.
Pig, you are a guru,

44:01.083 --> 44:03.916
A pope, a Zen master.

44:04.125 --> 44:06.750
Love! Really, love.
San Felipe School.

44:06.875 --> 44:08.333
Wow! Bingo!

44:14.083 --> 44:15.541
Seven by nine?

44:16.250 --> 44:19.625
- 57?
- No, my love. 63.

44:19.708 --> 44:22.125
If not, you do the little trick
I taught you with the fingers.

44:22.208 --> 44:23.666
San Felipe School, good morning.

44:23.750 --> 44:26.000
-How I can help?
-Hello.

44:26.208 --> 44:28.833
Am I communicating with
the San Felipe de Mechuque school?

44:28.958 --> 44:31.791
-Yes, the same one.
-Oh, great.

44:31.916 --> 44:33.291
Puppy, buckle up.

44:33.583 --> 44:36.958
I am calling to find out
the issue of the enrollment.

44:37.416 --> 44:39.875
Do you want to enroll
your child for next year?

44:39.958 --> 44:40.791
Yes.

44:40.875 --> 44:43.375
-I mean, actually, my daughter.
-What!?

44:45.625 --> 44:48.666
I have a very close friend

44:48.875 --> 44:51.958
and she highly recommended
the school, because she was there.

44:52.208 --> 44:53.958
I don't know if you remember her.
Her name is Ariela.

44:54.083 --> 44:56.291
-I don't want to go to Machuque!
-Sofia, please.

44:56.375 --> 44:58.000
Ariela?

44:58.125 --> 45:00.375
Yes. Mom of...

45:00.750 --> 45:04.166
... of a very nice ginger, Alex.

45:04.916 --> 45:07.500
Ah, of course I remember them.

45:07.625 --> 45:11.458
-Very loving the child, huh?
-I don't want to transfer to Machuque!

45:11.875 --> 45:13.875
Yes, he is very loving.

45:13.958 --> 45:16.000
Too bad what happened to his dad, right?

45:16.083 --> 45:17.750
Too bad he's no longer with us.

45:17.875 --> 45:19.708
-Right?
-Yes, it's true.

45:19.833 --> 45:22.125
But hey,
he made the decision to leave.

45:22.916 --> 45:24.958
-From this world?
-What?

45:25.208 --> 45:28.791
-Alex's father passed away, right?
-No, of course not.

45:28.916 --> 45:30.791
-He is in the hospital.
-In coma?

45:31.333 --> 45:34.458
-No, he's alive.
-At the Mechuque hospital?

45:35.166 --> 45:37.500
In Port-au-Prince hospital.

45:38.291 --> 45:40.791
Wait, we're talking
about the same Alex's dad...

45:40.875 --> 45:42.291
I'm not going to Mechuque!

45:42.375 --> 45:44.291
Sorry, sorry,
I'm here with a tween.

45:44.375 --> 45:47.083
She is furious, but calm,
everything is fine.

45:47.208 --> 45:49.583
Are we talking
about Alex's dad, the firefighter?

45:50.541 --> 45:53.000
Yes, I mean, he is a doctor.

45:54.375 --> 45:57.208
-Daniela's husband is a doctor?
-Who is Daniela?

45:57.625 --> 46:00.750
-Ariela, I'm sorry.
-Of course he is a doctor.

46:00.833 --> 46:03.875
Hey, are you friends with Ariela or not?

46:04.500 --> 46:07.708
Yes, yes,
we are friends, very close ones.

46:07.916 --> 46:10.750
Do you happen to have
any information on...

46:10.875 --> 46:13.958
or a contact, an email,
a phone number of Alex's dad

46:14.041 --> 46:17.333
-to contact him?
-No, no, no, no, no.

46:17.458 --> 46:19.375
I can't share information.

46:20.583 --> 46:22.375
Not even for a generous...

46:22.833 --> 46:25.291
...figure or a personal contribution of...

46:26.416 --> 46:30.458
-Sorry, sorry.
-Ah, well, that's something else.

46:36.750 --> 46:37.958
-Alberto!
-Hello.

46:38.083 --> 46:41.666
Wonderful! Thanks with all my heart.
Thanks for answering my email.

46:41.750 --> 46:43.791
-And thanks for...
-Is Alex okay?

46:43.916 --> 46:47.166
-That's why I answered.
-Yes, he is very well. Calm down.

46:47.666 --> 46:51.166
-Where is he?
-In Santiago. He is with his mother.

46:51.958 --> 46:54.458
He is a classmate of my Puppy,
Sofia, at Saint Michael School.

46:54.708 --> 46:57.791
Doctor, doctor,

46:58.750 --> 47:00.083
Where are you?

47:00.750 --> 47:02.208
I am in Haiti.

47:02.625 --> 47:04.708
Oh, sorry.
And I am eating. So sorry.

47:04.791 --> 47:07.833
Sorry. We eat here too.
Less, but we eat.

47:07.958 --> 47:10.291
Are you with Ariela?
Did she ask you to call me?

47:10.416 --> 47:12.875
No, not at all. Alberto,
I am calling you because

47:13.708 --> 47:16.458
she is scamming my friends
and I don't know what to do.

47:16.791 --> 47:18.750
Do not believe her nothing,
nothing!

47:19.125 --> 47:21.083
Look, I have a theory
that her name isn't even Ariela.

47:21.791 --> 47:26.083
See, after she did to me
what she did to me,

47:26.375 --> 47:27.958
I had to start from scratch.

47:28.125 --> 47:30.000
And here I have been warmly welcomed.

47:30.375 --> 47:33.375
Here I discovered that
what had happened to me meant nothing.

47:33.458 --> 47:35.333
Well, I don't know if nothing.
I wanted to die, really.

47:35.458 --> 47:36.791
But here they know
what it is to suffer.

47:37.458 --> 47:40.375
-It's been a good place to start.
-What are you talking about?

47:41.625 --> 47:45.000
She took everything from me.
And then she kept taking from me.

47:45.125 --> 47:48.666
I was surprised because I thought when
they took everything and ruined your life,

47:48.750 --> 47:52.166
they couldn't take anything else from you.
So she probably has my soul,

47:52.541 --> 47:55.958
my dignity and my will to live,
in a box, there, in Santiago.

47:56.041 --> 47:59.875
She took my money, my family
and now Alex, he doesn't want to see me.

48:00.083 --> 48:04.541
Well, don't worry, because together
we are going to unmask her, okay?

48:04.791 --> 48:07.500
I want everyone to know what kind
of person she is. You know?

48:07.625 --> 48:11.041
-When are you going back to Chile?
-No! I can't go back to Chile.

48:11.166 --> 48:12.583
I can't face her.

48:12.666 --> 48:14.458
No! I am not close to being ready.

48:14.708 --> 48:16.875
You are the only person
who knows the truth about her.

48:16.958 --> 48:19.875
Look, do you want some advice?

48:20.125 --> 48:22.125
A piece of advice
that could save your life.

48:22.458 --> 48:24.666
Get away from her!

48:24.750 --> 48:26.416
-But, Alberto...
-Look.

48:27.750 --> 48:31.708
If you let that... being into your life,

48:32.416 --> 48:36.125
She's going to do like this, like this.
She's going to take everything!

48:36.250 --> 48:37.625
Don't you want to see your son?

48:38.583 --> 48:40.708
It's what I want most in the world.

48:41.458 --> 48:43.291
But I can't get close to that woman.

48:43.708 --> 48:46.333
- Doctor,
- No, please, don't...

48:46.416 --> 48:47.458
Alberto!

48:47.541 --> 48:50.000
Again, good luck.
But I can't help you.

48:55.750 --> 48:58.541
And kick,
and turn, and up.

48:58.666 --> 49:00.291
-Yes! We have it.
-Okay.

49:00.375 --> 49:02.583
That is our last move. Okay?

49:02.666 --> 49:06.125
-Daniela, incredible, as always.
-Thanks, thanks.

49:06.250 --> 49:08.958
-The rest, very well too.
-Thank you, Father.

49:09.166 --> 49:11.000
Almost everyone.
Trinity.

49:11.541 --> 49:14.250
What's happening?
A little lost? A little...?

49:14.333 --> 49:16.416
No! No. It' s all good.
Everything perfect.

49:16.500 --> 49:18.833
Remember, dancing is love.

49:18.916 --> 49:20.750
You need to have good elongation.

49:20.833 --> 49:23.416
Girls, this is the essay we need.

49:23.500 --> 49:25.333
-Great, Father.
-We are so close.

49:25.416 --> 49:27.458
It turned out very well,
so thank you very much, Father. Bye.

49:27.583 --> 49:29.166
-Okay, okay.
-Bye, Father.

49:29.416 --> 49:31.208
-Bye bye!
-Hey! No pushing.

49:31.541 --> 49:33.416
-Please stay.
-I am sorry. I have to use

49:33.500 --> 49:36.833
-the screen minutes I have left.
-No screen minutes available.

49:36.916 --> 49:38.125
Idiot.

49:38.333 --> 49:39.666
Good, perfect.

49:39.875 --> 49:43.666
Because Mommies,
a miracle has happened.

49:43.916 --> 49:46.750
-What a thrill!
-Oh, no. What did she think of now?

49:46.875 --> 49:49.583
Someone has risen from the dead.

49:49.708 --> 49:50.750
Who?

49:52.541 --> 49:54.500
-Daniela's husband.
-Ooh!

49:55.083 --> 49:57.166
-What?
-No! No, no, no, no, no.

49:57.625 --> 49:59.833
-Do not play with that.
-Exactly.

50:00.125 --> 50:02.833
I'm not playing.
So, please tell the truth, Daniela.

50:02.916 --> 50:05.916
-I don't know what you mean.
-Wait. No, don't say anything.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
These are Trini's crazy things.
Shall we go?

50:08.541 --> 50:10.291
Does it look familiar to you, Daniela?

50:10.750 --> 50:12.333
Or should I call you Ariela.

50:13.750 --> 50:14.958
That's him?

50:16.541 --> 50:18.583
No, I can't look at the screen.
Who is he?

50:18.708 --> 50:22.375
-It seems that it is... your husband?
-Exactly. He is Daniela's husband.

50:22.458 --> 50:24.666
-But wasn't the man dead?
-No!

50:25.166 --> 50:27.208
He is very much alive,
and in good health.

50:34.958 --> 50:36.416
Is that the best you have?

50:36.500 --> 50:39.041
-Ok, ok, Trinidad, enough.
-No, Milagros.

50:42.125 --> 50:43.583
I owe you an explanation.

50:46.541 --> 50:47.833
Trinidad is right.

50:49.583 --> 50:50.833
Alberto is alive.

50:52.166 --> 50:54.458
But he is a bad man.
That's why I got divorced.

50:54.541 --> 50:55.958
But what a waste of time.

50:56.041 --> 50:58.375
Because you didn't tell
the truth at first.

50:58.458 --> 51:01.000
Because the grant requirements said

51:01.083 --> 51:03.208
they didn't accept divorced mothers.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.666
I lied, yes.

51:06.958 --> 51:08.333
But I did it for my son.

51:08.833 --> 51:10.625
God knows
I can't give him everything.

51:10.708 --> 51:12.500
And we really need that grant.

51:13.375 --> 51:17.375
I apologize for lying to you,
but I would do it a thousand times.

51:17.458 --> 51:18.833
I would do anything for my son.

51:18.916 --> 51:20.291
-Don't you?
-Yes, friend.

51:20.375 --> 51:22.875
-Come on!
-I just wanted to start from scratch,

51:22.958 --> 51:25.750
for Alex to had a normal childhood.

51:26.916 --> 51:29.250
After all what he has suffered
with his father.

51:29.541 --> 51:31.500
His father, the monster!

51:32.583 --> 51:35.166
I talked to him
and he told me everything.

51:35.458 --> 51:37.958
-You spoke with him?
-Of course, yes.

51:38.416 --> 51:40.916
I was surprised because I thought
when they took everything

51:41.000 --> 51:43.541
and ruined your life,
they couldn't take anything else from you.

51:44.416 --> 51:46.541
-I have to go.
-Where are you going?

51:46.666 --> 51:48.083
I have to go.
I have to runaway.

51:48.166 --> 51:49.750
I can't stay in this country.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.291
-But why?
-Because Alberto is very violent.

51:53.375 --> 51:55.750
He was chasing me.
He never left me alone.

51:56.250 --> 51:58.750
I'm scared to death
to think what he can do to Alex.

51:58.833 --> 51:59.916
He is very kind.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.791
Listen, he is a non-violent person.
I saw him.

52:02.875 --> 52:05.583
He is in Haiti helping others
who are very grateful to him.

52:05.708 --> 52:07.041
It's his front, Trinidad.

52:07.166 --> 52:10.833
He always does that,
but I'm sure he's here in Chile.

52:11.166 --> 52:12.833
Now, now,
calm down, calm down.

52:14.666 --> 52:19.333
-Luna, I know you are impressionable.
-I'm not impressionable.

52:19.458 --> 52:22.916
Sure, the vaccines with 5G, the magnesium
chloride that cures, the earth is flat.

52:23.041 --> 52:25.250
I am open-minded,
it is quite different.

52:25.375 --> 52:29.541
But even to you it has to be obvious
that she is lying.

52:29.625 --> 52:32.000
She is trying
to manipulate us once again.

52:32.083 --> 52:34.250
Her name is not even Daniela,
her name is Ariela.

52:34.333 --> 52:36.083
Yes, my name is Daniela.

52:36.375 --> 52:38.333
My name is Ariela Daniela Mariela.

52:38.416 --> 52:39.375
So original.

52:39.458 --> 52:41.250
I had to use my middle name

52:41.333 --> 52:42.958
so that Alberto couldn't find me.

52:43.166 --> 52:45.666
You don't know how much
I've suffered, Trinidad.

52:46.166 --> 52:48.791
And now, because of you,
he's going to find me again.

52:49.291 --> 52:50.458
Calm down.

52:52.291 --> 52:54.291
I understand your mistrust.

52:54.500 --> 52:55.708
I would too.

52:57.416 --> 52:59.625
Thanks.
Really, thank you for everything.

53:00.833 --> 53:02.833
These were the best days of my life.

53:03.125 --> 53:05.875
No, no, Danielle, no.
Do not go.

53:05.958 --> 53:07.250
Of course we believe you.

53:07.333 --> 53:10.375
Now, believe her,
there are violent men all over the world.

53:11.291 --> 53:12.625
Are you serious?

53:14.166 --> 53:17.083
This time you crossed the line, Trinidad.

53:17.833 --> 53:19.958
You got into Daniela's private life.

53:20.041 --> 53:22.750
-Ariela!
-Ariela Daniela Mariela!

53:22.916 --> 53:24.166
Stop now.

53:24.250 --> 53:26.416
Can't you see
you're exposing her and Alex?

53:26.791 --> 53:28.291
Why so little sorority?

53:28.625 --> 53:31.250
-She is lying!
-It's all my fault.

53:31.333 --> 53:33.875
I should never have married
a man like him.

53:33.958 --> 53:35.958
It's the patriarchy's fault.
It's not your fault.

53:36.083 --> 53:38.375
Don't worry.
We are with you.

53:38.458 --> 53:41.458
No means no.
To fight with everything.

53:41.541 --> 53:44.583
Alert, alert, sexist alert!

53:44.666 --> 53:47.500
Cut it down
with your revolutionary shouts.

53:47.583 --> 53:49.250
Please, we have a problem.

53:50.500 --> 53:51.833
-Thank you.
-I'm leaving.

53:55.666 --> 53:58.875
-Hey! Julia!
-No, what a waste of time.

53:58.958 --> 54:01.416
Frankly, I'm not
for these melodramas. It's over.

54:01.958 --> 54:04.291
And?
Was her husband dead or alive?

54:04.583 --> 54:05.750
I missed it.

54:29.958 --> 54:31.541
Come on, Puppy, out.

54:32.750 --> 54:36.083
You are even
more peculiar than usual, Puppy.

54:36.208 --> 54:37.958
Did something happen in catechesis?

54:39.083 --> 54:41.291
Nothing escapes mom's eyes.

54:41.375 --> 54:42.791
So, please tell me.

54:45.416 --> 54:49.541
Alex microaggresses me
when Father Anthony isn't looking.

54:49.833 --> 54:51.416
And when I tell him something,

54:51.500 --> 54:54.541
he says that I'm the one bothering him
and no one believes me.

54:55.375 --> 54:56.583
Alex does what to you?

54:57.166 --> 54:59.416
Microaggressions.

55:00.500 --> 55:02.500
Microaggressions.

55:02.708 --> 55:04.875
It is the systematic
and repetitive practice

55:04.958 --> 55:08.125
of small acts of psychological violence.

55:10.333 --> 55:12.208
-That's from the...
-From the podcast

55:12.333 --> 55:15.375
"Little Big Pains of Childhood"

55:16.208 --> 55:17.916
by Pepe Mari Manzanares.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.583
Are you telling me that this kid,
Alex, is bullying you?

55:20.666 --> 55:24.166
Bullying is when there is physical
and psychological violence in a big way.

55:24.875 --> 55:26.583
He microaggresses me.

55:29.250 --> 55:31.333
Can I stop going to catechesis?

55:32.375 --> 55:35.166
No, my love,
because we are going to solve this,

55:35.458 --> 55:39.375
because that infernal ginger
is going to be micro attacked

55:39.833 --> 55:41.541
as the guy on the podcast says.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.875
Let's go.
Get down, Puppy.

55:45.250 --> 55:47.833
Clarita, please,
can you frame it a little better?

55:48.333 --> 55:51.833
No, there. We're going to start
with that, that's the first one.

55:52.083 --> 55:55.208
Dads, moms,
moms, dads, please, attention.

55:56.041 --> 55:57.958
Well, welcome.

55:58.375 --> 56:00.500
As everyone knows,
the fire that suffered

56:00.583 --> 56:04.000
the "Grandpa, tell me you" nursery home
left it in appalling conditions.

56:04.541 --> 56:07.875
My heart breaks just seeing
these poor grandparents.

56:08.500 --> 56:11.041
But with the donations
we're all going to make,

56:11.250 --> 56:12.291
it could look like this.

56:14.666 --> 56:17.750
The foundation suggested putting
a commemorative bronze plaque

56:17.833 --> 56:22.208
in one of the halls and baptizing it
"María Gracia Vicuña Montt Hall".

56:22.708 --> 56:25.708
But I, of course, rejected that initiative
because I consider that

56:26.250 --> 56:30.208
it should bear the name of all
the Saint Michael School parents.

56:33.041 --> 56:35.375
Don't expect me to be on time
with this old cell phone.

56:35.458 --> 56:37.208
No, calm down, Julia.
You arrived just in time.

56:37.291 --> 56:40.125
Thank you, Maria Gracia. A big applause
for her, please. Clap, clap.

56:40.208 --> 56:43.083
-What happened?
-Well, now let's go to the subject

56:43.541 --> 56:45.458
that summons us.
A really important topic.

56:45.583 --> 56:48.416
We have to decide what we are going
to do about microaggressions.

56:48.500 --> 56:51.208
Good thing that you bring
that topic up, Trinidad,

56:51.333 --> 56:55.333
because we have learned
that Sofía has done them

56:55.458 --> 56:58.875
-these past few weeks.
-Suffered, you mean.

56:58.958 --> 57:00.958
No, done them.

57:01.791 --> 57:05.625
-Wait, my Puppy has been...
-The responsible for putting at risk

57:05.708 --> 57:08.666
-my Alex's mental health. Poor thing.
-What?

57:08.833 --> 57:10.541
-Nights without being able to sleep.
-Without sleeping.

57:10.625 --> 57:12.333
-Concentration difficulty.
-Concentration.

57:12.458 --> 57:14.625
Crying. I ask you to please
tell your daughter

57:14.708 --> 57:16.625
to stop harassing my Alex, please,

57:16.708 --> 57:19.708
because what your Pup is doing
is not microaggression,

57:19.791 --> 57:23.708
-it is bully...
-Wait, don't go smearing

57:23.833 --> 57:25.416
my Puppy with that word.

57:25.541 --> 57:27.875
-Llying.
-Bullying, Trinidad.

57:28.333 --> 57:30.916
Daniela told me that Sofia

57:31.750 --> 57:33.750
draws him pictures of...

57:34.125 --> 57:35.208
You say it.

57:35.291 --> 57:37.333
-Female genitals!
-In her notebook.

57:37.666 --> 57:39.916
That's preposterous.
It doesn't exist, it's not true.

57:40.250 --> 57:44.500
Sofía told me Álex microaggresses her
when no one sees him.

57:44.625 --> 57:47.541
-What a coincidence, nobody sees him.
-Yeah, right.

57:47.750 --> 57:50.041
-We have evidence, look.
-We have evidence.

57:51.958 --> 57:53.416
-Look, everyone.
-It's a lie.

57:53.500 --> 57:56.166
This is absolutely a lie.
My Puppy only draws pink unicorns...

57:56.250 --> 57:57.250
Well, they're black now

57:57.375 --> 57:59.458
because she's going through
a memo phase, a bit dark,

57:59.541 --> 58:02.833
-but she would never do a thing like that.
-Well, I think

58:03.250 --> 58:05.958
there is no need to go
on the matter any further.

58:06.083 --> 58:08.583
We have to talk about
what is really important.

58:08.708 --> 58:11.708
-The new committee.
-What new committee?

58:12.666 --> 58:14.875
Well, there has to be
a shift in power.

58:15.375 --> 58:17.666
It is dangerous
for a single person

58:17.750 --> 58:20.416
to remain in the same position
for a long time.

58:20.583 --> 58:22.250
That creates dictators.

58:24.333 --> 58:26.250
I know I'm new to this school

58:26.375 --> 58:31.250
and I still don't know how everything
works, but I think the person responsible

58:31.333 --> 58:34.416
to improve the life of my son
must be the new president.

58:35.291 --> 58:36.458
You, Milagros.

58:39.958 --> 58:42.583
Sorry. This is a democratic process.
We have to vote.

58:42.666 --> 58:44.750
Let's vote then.
Who votes for Trinidad?

58:46.208 --> 58:49.083
-Why are we voting?
-1, 2. Who votes for Milagros?

58:49.708 --> 58:52.833
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

58:52.958 --> 58:55.166
12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

58:57.291 --> 58:58.416
Okay.

58:59.458 --> 59:00.833
I assume my defeat.

59:02.250 --> 59:04.291
And I accept the position
of vice president.

59:04.416 --> 59:06.291
-Treasurer.
-It's the same.

59:06.458 --> 59:07.916
It's not the same.

59:08.375 --> 59:11.958
In fact, I had thought
of someone else for that position.

59:14.458 --> 59:15.791
-Me?
-Yes!

59:15.875 --> 59:18.125
-No, I wouldn't be able to.
-You are able.

59:19.083 --> 59:20.666
Does anyone object?

59:21.958 --> 59:23.000
No.

59:24.375 --> 59:26.666
-This is a coup!
-No, Trinidad.

59:27.791 --> 59:30.958
This is the result
of a democratic process.

59:31.750 --> 59:32.958
How you wanted it.

59:34.333 --> 59:36.583
Bravo for our new president!

59:37.208 --> 59:39.500
-Clap your hands!
-To the treasurer!

59:44.708 --> 59:46.916
Come on, my love,
Mommy's puppy.

59:47.083 --> 59:49.750
Look, don't worry,
because the truth always comes out.

59:50.125 --> 59:52.500
We are going to prove
your innocence. Right, Pig?

59:53.750 --> 59:56.208
Objective facts
no longer matter

59:56.333 --> 59:58.625
when post-truth sets in.

59:59.125 --> 01:00:00.666
Is that from...?

01:00:00.958 --> 01:00:03.708
From the "Facts, Not Feelings" podcast

01:00:03.791 --> 01:00:05.416
by Pepe Mari Manzanares.

01:00:09.916 --> 01:00:11.166
-Pig?
-Hmm?

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:13.083
Pig.

01:00:15.666 --> 01:00:19.791
Tell her something, Chancho. She listens
to some awful language podcasts.

01:00:22.958 --> 01:00:25.333
-My love, calm down...
-Exactly.

01:00:25.541 --> 01:00:28.833
Because we are going
to unmask that lying child.

01:00:29.083 --> 01:00:31.750
We are going to unmask him.
And I'm going to call each mom

01:00:31.875 --> 01:00:33.541
to tell them your side of the story.

01:00:33.625 --> 01:00:36.708
-Very good, Pig.
-It is practically impossible

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:40.208
to change the narrative
after a public accusation.

01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:44.166
At least I know I'm not a liar.

01:00:48.375 --> 01:00:50.750
Pig, why don't they get my messages?

01:00:55.125 --> 01:00:57.166
Clear your face, my love, please.

01:00:57.833 --> 01:00:59.083
Because they blocked you.

01:00:59.791 --> 01:01:00.833
What!

01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:04.333
Julia, do you know what's up
with the SOS MAMIS chat?

01:01:04.416 --> 01:01:06.125
I write
but no one answers me.

01:01:06.666 --> 01:01:08.041
Maybe someone hacked us?

01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:12.625
Puppy, my love, please,
don't push the carrot apart. Eat it.

01:01:12.958 --> 01:01:16.791
Julia! Can you look at the screen
for a minute please, to answer me?

01:01:17.416 --> 01:01:19.625
We had to take you out
of the chat room.

01:01:19.916 --> 01:01:20.916
But why?

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.666
A chat with you and Dani,
is not possible.

01:01:24.208 --> 01:01:25.958
Imagine the energy tension.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.958
Better for some time to pass,
and the air is renewed.

01:01:30.916 --> 01:01:33.458
Buddha, my love,
come down from the tree.

01:01:33.708 --> 01:01:35.166
Or are you sleeping up there?

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:37.166
It was three votes to two.

01:01:37.583 --> 01:01:39.375
We thought you were
going vote to stay.

01:01:39.541 --> 01:01:43.416
So, it was your vote plus my vote,
against the other three.

01:01:43.708 --> 01:01:47.708
Daniela did not want to vote, she said
she did not want to make such a decision.

01:01:47.833 --> 01:01:49.250
But don't worry,

01:01:49.375 --> 01:01:52.083
because I can tell you
everything they talk about.

01:01:52.791 --> 01:01:55.416
Did you kick me out of a WhatsApp group
that I created myself?

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:58.125
How can that be?
Please explain it to me.

01:02:01.666 --> 01:02:03.958
Don't pretend to be disconnected,
I know you're there.

01:02:04.083 --> 01:02:05.958
You're online, Milagros.
I see you.

01:02:10.083 --> 01:02:12.416
You blocked me!
Really?

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.541
Milagros!

01:02:15.541 --> 01:02:17.125
Trinidad blocked

01:02:18.916 --> 01:02:19.916
I'll kill her.

01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:22.333
Angelita, did you see
that your puppy's sweater

01:02:22.416 --> 01:02:24.291
is in the lost and found
in the closet?

01:02:26.833 --> 01:02:28.833
-Hello, Mia.
-Hello, Rosita.

01:02:31.125 --> 01:02:33.958
Mommy's puppy,
it's at times like these

01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:37.208
where the little girls distinguish
themselves from the warriors.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:41.208
-And what are we?
-Two people doomed to ostracism?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.291
Is that from Pepe,
the man of the apples?

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.583
Pepe Mari Manzanares.

01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:50.875
"Great Greek Punishments
of the 21st Century".

01:02:51.583 --> 01:02:52.625
Okay.

01:02:52.916 --> 01:02:55.250
Well, my love,
you keep calm.

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:59.000
Because your mom is a warrior.
And a Greek one.

01:02:59.958 --> 01:03:01.041
And your warrior mom

01:03:01.125 --> 01:03:04.541
is going to make us take revenge
on all those who have hurt us.

01:03:05.083 --> 01:03:08.500
The need for revenge
can only be had with kindness.

01:03:08.666 --> 01:03:10.500
Otherwise, hatred grows.

01:03:10.833 --> 01:03:13.708
But kindness does not exist
when people act as a mass

01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:15.750
and just want to vent their anger.

01:03:15.875 --> 01:03:19.500
And thus begins a cycle of hate
that is impossible to break.

01:03:19.583 --> 01:03:21.291
We are facing a paradox.

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:24.875
Sure. Yes.

01:03:25.333 --> 01:03:26.791
Maybe, too.

01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:29.625
Anyway, I think it's more like...

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:34.375
Honey, you are forbidden to listen
to those podcasts, did you hear me?

01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:36.416
And clear your face,
I can't see your eyes.

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.833
Daniela! Daniela!
I need to talk with you.

01:03:38.958 --> 01:03:42.416
-Trinidad, how are you?
-Outraged, yes.

01:03:43.208 --> 01:03:45.000
But you know that I am a warrior.

01:03:45.166 --> 01:03:47.333
-And you know what happens....
-Are you threatening me?

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:50.000
-What?
-I feel like you're threatening me

01:03:50.291 --> 01:03:51.958
in front of my son.
Right, Alex?

01:03:52.083 --> 01:03:55.500
Yes, mom. I feel threatened
by an older woman.

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:58.958
-And Sofia is also threatening us.
-What? I have not done anything!

01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:00.375
Do you feel threatened by Sofia?

01:04:00.458 --> 01:04:03.750
Yes, mom always teases me at school.
I want her to leave me alone.

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:06.291
You are completely crazy!

01:04:07.666 --> 01:04:09.000
Didn't you learn anything?

01:04:09.833 --> 01:04:12.041
Besides your friends,
what else do you want to lose?

01:04:12.333 --> 01:04:13.458
What are you talking about?

01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:19.416
By God, he's a handsome man!

01:04:20.625 --> 01:04:23.666
Oh no.
That's too much!

01:04:24.041 --> 01:04:25.583
The Pig is mine!

01:04:26.416 --> 01:04:27.416
Help!

01:04:28.208 --> 01:04:31.000
It's my Pig!
Nobody touches my Pig!

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.958
-Let go!
-Please, someone do something!

01:04:35.583 --> 01:04:36.916
Trinidad!

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:42.708
Let me get this straight.

01:04:42.791 --> 01:04:46.208
All this is because you were taken out
of a WhatsApp group, Trinidad?

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:47.791
It is far more complex.

01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:51.291
Trinidad, you hit Daniela,

01:04:51.375 --> 01:04:53.708
-there are multiple witnesses.
-She provoked me.

01:04:54.166 --> 01:04:56.333
In addition,
I learned that your daughter

01:04:57.541 --> 01:05:01.750
was drawing pictures
in Alex's notebook.

01:05:03.083 --> 01:05:05.208
My daughter would be
absolutely incapable

01:05:05.333 --> 01:05:08.458
of doing a disgusting thing like that.
She is innocent!

01:05:08.541 --> 01:05:11.250
Trinidad, here is the evidence.

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:15.958
So, I think the only way
to solve all this

01:05:16.041 --> 01:05:19.000
is a public apology.
You and your daughter.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:24.500
It's ok, it's ok. The truth is
I do not want problems with anyone.

01:05:26.166 --> 01:05:27.375
Cynical.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.458
Wait, wait.

01:05:29.875 --> 01:05:32.458
Well, this is what we are going to do.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.625
You're going to stay away
from Daniela,

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:37.916
at least ten meters.

01:05:38.375 --> 01:05:39.916
We don't want
any more problems.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.375
-It is in everyone's best interest.
-Ten meters.

01:05:43.208 --> 01:05:44.541
Ha! Then tell me,

01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:47.708
how am I going to do the dance
for the grandparents?

01:05:48.541 --> 01:05:50.375
-Wait, that's the final amount?
-Yes.

01:05:50.458 --> 01:05:52.083
-That has been raised?
-Yes.

01:05:52.166 --> 01:05:55.083
Oh no, I just can't believe it.
Let's see, wait, calm down.

01:05:55.291 --> 01:05:57.541
Hello everyone,
I want to tell you as Chair

01:05:57.625 --> 01:05:59.625
of the Vicuña Montt Foundation,

01:06:00.375 --> 01:06:02.208
I am deeply disappointed

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:06.541
all of you because we have not been
able to reach the necessary amount.

01:06:06.833 --> 01:06:09.208
Apparently,
the Saint Michael School community

01:06:09.458 --> 01:06:12.500
it is not as committed
to the elderly as it seems.

01:06:13.375 --> 01:06:17.291
For this reason, I had to make
the decision to make a personal donation,

01:06:17.833 --> 01:06:20.083
let's see if we can meet the goal.

01:06:23.666 --> 01:06:27.083
The idea is that we can reach the goal.
So I'm doing this not for me,

01:06:27.375 --> 01:06:29.958
but it for all the grandparents
in the nursery home

01:06:30.416 --> 01:06:31.833
"Grandfather tell me"

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:35.291
Drumroll.

01:06:37.041 --> 01:06:40.625
We have a new collection count.

01:06:40.875 --> 01:06:42.875
Vice President, please.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.833
-Treasurer.
-Is the same.

01:06:45.916 --> 01:06:48.000
-Is not the same.
-Go ahead.

01:06:50.458 --> 01:06:53.416
I am pleased to announce
the new amount.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:54.625
It's...

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:58.416
Pesos!

01:07:00.291 --> 01:07:02.958
I would like to tell you
that it is the largest amount

01:07:03.041 --> 01:07:06.583
at a Saint Michael School
charity event.

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:13.125
I want to thank all of you
and especially Daniela.

01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:16.750
-I'm dying of boredom.
-Thanks to her,

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.583
I am president.

01:07:29.041 --> 01:07:30.916
Thank you very much, Milagros.

01:07:32.208 --> 01:07:34.750
Now,
it is with the grace of the Lord

01:07:34.833 --> 01:07:38.166
that we want to celebrate all grandparents

01:07:38.333 --> 01:07:41.833
who made a tremendous effort to be here.

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:52.375
Ugh. Okay.

01:07:52.958 --> 01:07:58.500
Without further ado,
let's now dance with your favorites.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.125
The SOS MAMIS,

01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:03.333
new formation.

01:08:05.583 --> 01:08:07.083
A bigger round of applause!

01:08:17.375 --> 01:08:19.332
My love, shouldn't you be there?

01:08:22.041 --> 01:08:23.541
-Let's go.
-Positions.

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:26.000
-Please, let's go.
-Music, please.

01:08:26.082 --> 01:08:27.125
Let's go.

01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:29.750
-Come on, let's go, Puppy.
-My love, but...

01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:34.291
Mom, what if we apologize?

01:08:35.207 --> 01:08:37.291
Did you make those gross drawings?

01:08:37.375 --> 01:08:40.875
Mom, if you mean the vulvas,
they're not gross. And it wasn't me.

01:08:41.375 --> 01:08:44.082
But you did hit Daniela.

01:08:44.207 --> 01:08:46.666
-Oh, look, there's Sofi.
-OK, right.

01:08:49.041 --> 01:08:51.332
-Hello.
-Don't look at her, don't look at her.

01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:53.957
Now, she is no longer
with us, she left.

01:08:54.041 --> 01:08:55.791
-Let's go.
-Okay.

01:08:55.875 --> 01:08:57.250
Blanqui,
how is your candy?

01:08:57.375 --> 01:09:00.832
Let's apologize.
When people don't want to listen,

01:09:00.957 --> 01:09:03.541
forgiveness,
however false, works.

01:09:04.625 --> 01:09:09.041
Look, Puppy, as much as
Pepe Manzana's podcast says so,

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:11.750
we are not going to lie.

01:09:12.041 --> 01:09:15.041
That's my Pig! Aha!

01:09:17.082 --> 01:09:18.250
Beautiful, my love.

01:09:33.207 --> 01:09:36.375
Again a video call.
I told you, how stubborn.

01:09:36.457 --> 01:09:39.666
I can only receive phone calls,
faxes and letters.

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:41.916
-Has anyone talked to Daniela?
-Me!

01:09:42.125 --> 01:09:44.041
-When?
-Oh, you mean today?

01:09:44.791 --> 01:09:46.791
No, I thought in life.

01:09:46.957 --> 01:09:48.000
No, today.

01:09:48.082 --> 01:09:51.957
Last night she agreed to go to the bar
but never showed up, so I drinked hers.

01:09:52.041 --> 01:09:54.458
I wanted to call her,
but I didn't have screen minutes.

01:09:54.541 --> 01:09:56.791
She also did not come
to the sun salutation.

01:09:56.916 --> 01:09:58.958
Ouch! OMG!

01:09:59.666 --> 01:10:03.333
What if because of Trinidad
her ex-husband found her

01:10:03.541 --> 01:10:06.208
-and did something to her?
-Don't be paranoid, please.

01:10:06.333 --> 01:10:09.166
-Especially before my first drink.
-In fact, today,

01:10:09.333 --> 01:10:11.625
we need to deposit
the money to the foundation.

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:15.916
-What do we do?
-I don't know.

01:10:16.083 --> 01:10:18.833
-Oh, oh.
-Don't be evil-minded.

01:10:18.916 --> 01:10:21.750
We have to go find her
before her ex-husband does.

01:10:22.166 --> 01:10:24.166
We have?
It is a lot of people.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.833
-Calm down!
-I do not have patience.

01:10:32.083 --> 01:10:33.208
Hello!

01:10:34.833 --> 01:10:35.958
Is Ariela here?

01:10:36.416 --> 01:10:39.583
-There's no Ariela here.
-Well, Ariela, Mariela, Daniela,

01:10:39.666 --> 01:10:40.750
whatever.

01:10:41.041 --> 01:10:42.916
But, aren't you her aunt?

01:10:43.958 --> 01:10:45.458
-No.
-What aunt?

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:48.125
-The senile dementia aunt.
-Oh.

01:10:48.541 --> 01:10:49.541
Hello!

01:10:49.875 --> 01:10:53.458
We are friends
with your niece, Ariela!

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:55.666
-Yes, yes.
-I'm not deaf!

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:57.291
She clearly has dementia.

01:10:57.416 --> 01:10:59.166
Why don't we go in
once and for all?

01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:01.416
Besides, this old lady won't remember.

01:11:01.541 --> 01:11:05.375
Look, here lives a young woman,

01:11:06.333 --> 01:11:07.541
beautiful,

01:11:07.916 --> 01:11:10.958
with a little buddha
with red hair.

01:11:11.125 --> 01:11:12.416
Oh! Look.

01:11:13.458 --> 01:11:14.833
Wait. Wait.

01:11:16.625 --> 01:11:17.958
She.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.500
Are you blind too?
Don't you recognize her, your niece?

01:11:21.583 --> 01:11:23.375
-Julia!
-Teresa.

01:11:24.041 --> 01:11:26.958
That's the motherfucker
who signed the lease

01:11:27.041 --> 01:11:30.000
and left without paying the rent.
She left two days ago.

01:11:31.166 --> 01:11:34.208
Now, open the bank account
and share the screen. Now.

01:11:34.416 --> 01:11:35.416
Where are you?

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.750
I don't want my Dante
to see me using a screen.

01:11:37.833 --> 01:11:39.833
Can you imagine the example I would set?

01:11:40.291 --> 01:11:42.208
Someone's withdrawal syndrome?

01:11:45.291 --> 01:11:47.125
-It can't be.
-What?

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:49.333
- It can't be.
-Huh?

01:11:49.416 --> 01:11:50.541
It can't be!

01:11:52.208 --> 01:11:54.625
-Oh?
-Yes, it can be.

01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:57.916
The money for the nursery home
is no longer in the account.

01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:01.083
-Oh!
-No, no, no, no, no.

01:12:03.125 --> 01:12:05.958
-Maybe we got hacked.
-I have the same account, the same,

01:12:06.041 --> 01:12:07.375
and no one has hacked me.

01:12:07.458 --> 01:12:11.500
Here are several transfers
to Teresa, Vanesa, Tomasa.

01:12:11.583 --> 01:12:13.791
-Who are they?
-They must all be her.

01:12:15.333 --> 01:12:16.458
Check this out.

01:12:18.041 --> 01:12:20.500
Page not available.
Link is broken or deleted.

01:12:20.583 --> 01:12:24.666
-Her profile no longer exists.
-She erased all traces. I mean...

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.083
She is a ghost?

01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:31.083
No, no, no!

01:12:31.541 --> 01:12:34.416
-Yes, yes, yes.
-We have been scammed.

01:12:35.125 --> 01:12:36.791
But where is the money?

01:12:38.208 --> 01:12:41.791
Sorry, Mommies, but I taught her
all about cryptocurrency.

01:12:41.875 --> 01:12:43.625
If we don't find it soon,

01:12:43.833 --> 01:12:46.625
that money is going to be
lost in the metaverse.

01:12:48.125 --> 01:12:49.541
-Meta what?
-Verse!

01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:51.166
Oh.

01:12:55.041 --> 01:12:56.166
And you?

01:12:58.833 --> 01:12:59.958
Trinidad...

01:13:01.625 --> 01:13:03.083
Are you here to humiliate me?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.833
-Uh, Daniela...
-Please, I beg you,

01:13:10.333 --> 01:13:11.750
don't mention her to me.
Okay?

01:13:14.625 --> 01:13:15.833
You were right.

01:13:16.375 --> 01:13:17.416
Uh?

01:13:18.208 --> 01:13:19.625
Daniela ripped us off.

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:21.583
What?

01:13:22.375 --> 01:13:23.916
Daniela ripped us off.

01:13:25.166 --> 01:13:26.250
No, the first thing.

01:13:27.208 --> 01:13:29.666
-Ehh, you were right?
-Yes.

01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:32.791
That.
Can you repeat it?

01:13:34.166 --> 01:13:35.375
You were right.

01:13:36.916 --> 01:13:39.083
Can you repeat it now,
a little louder?

01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:40.666
Oh, Trinidad.

01:13:43.583 --> 01:13:46.916
For you never to doubt
your former president again.

01:13:47.958 --> 01:13:49.250
President.

01:13:50.458 --> 01:13:52.125
I make my position available.

01:14:00.416 --> 01:14:01.625
Thanks.

01:14:03.875 --> 01:14:07.166
-What are we going to do?
-Let's get to work, then.

01:14:07.458 --> 01:14:10.541
First we have to go
to the place that never fails: Justice.

01:14:11.083 --> 01:14:13.625
Come with me to tidy up
and change my clothes, let's go.

01:14:13.708 --> 01:14:15.250
And she had three identity cards.

01:14:15.375 --> 01:14:17.750
And she gave me holy water
blessed by the Pope.

01:14:17.875 --> 01:14:19.541
And she said she didn't know how
to dance, but she did.

01:14:19.666 --> 01:14:21.750
-I made her treasurer.
-All the money was stolen.

01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:23.833
And she also stole my dignity
and my Puppy's.

01:14:23.916 --> 01:14:25.000
And mine?

01:14:25.166 --> 01:14:27.458
-She also scammed me.
- Your dignity?

01:14:27.708 --> 01:14:29.458
All this was because
you didn't listen to me.

01:14:29.541 --> 01:14:31.541
Also, how can you give her the grant?

01:14:31.666 --> 01:14:34.708
There are so many needy, honest,
wonderful people in this country.

01:14:34.791 --> 01:14:35.791
And you gave it to her.

01:14:35.916 --> 01:14:38.333
I did all the background checks,
with Father Anthony.

01:14:38.458 --> 01:14:41.916
Oh, I can't believe it. First problem,
and you throw the priest to the lions.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.958
This reminds me of a character
in the Bible who starts with J.

01:14:45.041 --> 01:14:47.875
-I'm not Judas!
-Can you stop a little bit, please?

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.041
Thanks.

01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:56.458
Ho, ho, hol...

01:14:57.375 --> 01:14:58.250
holi.

01:14:58.333 --> 01:14:59.833
It's with an Y,
not that one.

01:15:01.125 --> 01:15:02.250
Thanks.

01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:06.541
Look, I'll summarize it.
We are facing a case

01:15:06.625 --> 01:15:08.708
-of identity theft.
-And scam.

01:15:08.875 --> 01:15:10.416
-That's right.
-Wait, ladies,

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.500
I am not understanding you at all.

01:15:12.958 --> 01:15:14.875
What do you really need?

01:15:14.958 --> 01:15:16.958
-To find her.
-And put her in jail.

01:15:17.083 --> 01:15:19.500
-And to return the money.
-And do it now!

01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:22.333
Ahh, ok.

01:15:25.125 --> 01:15:27.666
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:15:30.333 --> 01:15:32.333
Okay.
He's not going to do anything.

01:15:40.208 --> 01:15:42.916
Golden rose, heal my body!
It's from school.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.291
It turns out that
the nursery home

01:15:46.416 --> 01:15:49.000
has not received a single peso
of the proceeds,

01:15:49.083 --> 01:15:52.250
not even my generous
and selfless donation.

01:15:52.958 --> 01:15:55.916
And the treasurer
does not answer my emails,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.875
does not answer the phone,
she is nowhere to be found.

01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:00.875
What happened to the treasurer?

01:16:04.208 --> 01:16:05.875
She is inexperienced...

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:09.958
... and she got confused
and put the wrong password.

01:16:10.041 --> 01:16:12.208
So they blocked the pin pass,

01:16:12.541 --> 01:16:15.541
and she was very embarrassed to call...

01:16:16.208 --> 01:16:18.416
She is from Mechuque,
what else can we ask of her?

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:21.791
But there's no problem. The bank
is already creating a new password.

01:16:21.916 --> 01:16:25.166
What happens is that they changed
the interface and the metadata. Whatever.

01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:28.791
The thing is, the key is going
to be ready in a few hours.

01:16:28.958 --> 01:16:33.250
-One day, two days, Ok, three.
-To give them a little more time.

01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:37.083
My IT team is in full contact with the
bank,

01:16:37.208 --> 01:16:40.625
so that password will appear
as soon as possible.

01:16:40.708 --> 01:16:41.791
Problem solved.

01:16:41.875 --> 01:16:43.833
Really?
That's great!

01:16:43.916 --> 01:16:45.583
What did the police station say?

01:16:45.666 --> 01:16:46.791
What police station?

01:16:46.958 --> 01:16:48.958
The police station
where the theft report was made.

01:16:49.208 --> 01:16:50.708
What theft report?

01:16:50.958 --> 01:16:54.125
Clarita, Clarita, Clarita.
Always so messed up in her head.

01:16:54.208 --> 01:16:56.500
Nothing, calm down.
This will be solved in three days.

01:16:56.583 --> 01:16:57.791
Four.

01:16:57.875 --> 01:17:00.041
Exactly, in five days,
everything will be Ok.

01:17:00.125 --> 01:17:02.916
Five days!
Five days.

01:17:03.041 --> 01:17:04.500
We don't have five days.

01:17:04.791 --> 01:17:07.708
You have 24 hours
to solve this problem.

01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:10.666
Starting... Now!

01:17:11.333 --> 01:17:13.875
And say what, Milagros?
The Treasurer scammed us,

01:17:13.958 --> 01:17:16.916
and look like incompetent people?
No, over my dead body.

01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:20.541
Julia, there has to be
some way to find the money.

01:17:20.625 --> 01:17:23.625
Tracking
a cryptocurrency account is impossible.

01:17:23.708 --> 01:17:26.708
And I gave her the rosary
of my Juan de Dios,

01:17:26.791 --> 01:17:29.541
that was blessed by the Pope
to that little boy Alex.

01:17:29.666 --> 01:17:31.416
It's just that Daniela was...

01:17:31.958 --> 01:17:33.125
...so devoted.

01:17:33.875 --> 01:17:35.958
I gave her the quartz of my Inti.

01:17:36.166 --> 01:17:37.833
Well, and I also gave her my...

01:17:38.666 --> 01:17:41.458
-She was like a sister to me.
-Also for me.

01:17:41.583 --> 01:17:44.875
That little boy Alex
is a little con man.

01:17:44.958 --> 01:17:47.791
-Didn't you say he was an entrepreneur?
-It's the same.

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:51.458
That's it!

01:17:52.375 --> 01:17:53.500
Of course!

01:17:54.083 --> 01:17:56.166
Alex has Dante's watch.

01:17:56.250 --> 01:17:57.375
-Julia!
-What?

01:17:57.458 --> 01:17:59.666
Dante's watch, Alex has it.

01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:00.958
It has GPS!

01:18:01.041 --> 01:18:03.333
-Let's track down that bitch.
-Let's go.

01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:07.916
-No, Julia, no!
-You are sick, please, I'll do it!

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.333
-You do it.
-What I do?

01:18:09.458 --> 01:18:11.916
-Open the "Search my watch" app.
-There.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.541
Search my watch Plus?
Or Search my personal watch?

01:18:14.666 --> 01:18:15.958
-No, the other one.
-The pink one?

01:18:16.041 --> 01:18:17.375
-No, it's one with...
-The light blue one?

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:19.291
A light blue, square,
with a circle in the middle.

01:18:19.416 --> 01:18:21.416
-But where is it, Julia?
-It says Search...

01:18:21.583 --> 01:18:22.833
Enough!

01:18:23.041 --> 01:18:25.625
-Hey, Zara!
-Hello, Julia.

01:18:25.958 --> 01:18:27.416
I missed your voice.

01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:30.500
Me too.

01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:32.583
Find Dante's watch.

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:36.458
-Find Dante's watch.
-Locating Dante's watch.

01:18:36.916 --> 01:18:39.875
It is 90 kilometers from your position,

01:18:39.958 --> 01:18:43.000
-at the Rancagua Catholic School.
-Rancagua...

01:18:43.083 --> 01:18:44.375
Oh, I love Rancagua!

01:18:46.083 --> 01:18:47.958
She's going to scam other mommies!

01:18:48.666 --> 01:18:50.916
Let's go.
Go, go, go, team.

01:18:51.125 --> 01:18:53.375
-You can see exactly...
-We can't have it!

01:18:53.458 --> 01:18:55.708
-Look, it looks perfect.
-Caravan, team, go!

01:18:57.291 --> 01:18:58.833
She fooled us all.

01:19:00.458 --> 01:19:02.666
She told me that she did not have...

01:19:05.458 --> 01:19:07.083
... since her husband died.

01:19:08.208 --> 01:19:10.416
And she taught me
everything about trantric sex...

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.125
She stole my autograph.

01:19:12.208 --> 01:19:14.083
She deceived everybody
saying that my Puppy

01:19:14.208 --> 01:19:15.833
had made those gross drawings.

01:19:16.333 --> 01:19:18.041
She didn't fool me about anything.

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.708
-Did she?
-What's to fool you with, Clarita?

01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:25.000
I...

01:19:26.166 --> 01:19:28.583
...would not be a good Christian...

01:19:30.208 --> 01:19:32.416
...if I didn't tell you, Trinidad...

01:19:34.375 --> 01:19:38.125
...that I am very sorry
I didn't believe you.

01:19:38.958 --> 01:19:40.166
And...

01:19:41.083 --> 01:19:42.250
...I apologize.

01:19:44.416 --> 01:19:45.500
Okay.
I'm sorry.

01:19:45.791 --> 01:19:47.333
What?

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:49.833
-I'm sorry, friend.
-I am sorry.

01:19:51.916 --> 01:19:54.541
-Here?
-Yes, the exit.

01:19:56.416 --> 01:19:57.750
I accept your apologies.

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:00.750
Thanks.

01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:04.750
But you know what hurts me the most?

01:20:04.916 --> 01:20:06.541
All that your Blessing suffered.

01:20:06.666 --> 01:20:09.375
No. Well, that too.
A little, obviously.

01:20:09.583 --> 01:20:11.833
But what hurts me the most is
you took me out of the choreography.

01:20:11.916 --> 01:20:13.041
Oh, come on.

01:20:13.125 --> 01:20:15.416
-Is that what hurts the most?
-Of course.

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.833
I risked my life for that dance.
Also, you did a lousy job,

01:20:17.916 --> 01:20:20.208
-very uncoordinated.
-It's not true!

01:20:20.375 --> 01:20:21.708
Yes, very uncoordinated.

01:20:21.875 --> 01:20:25.791
In the bounce, the sticky leg,
the chuchuka, the shinning, the rib.

01:20:25.916 --> 01:20:28.125
Well, it doesn't matter.
Nevermind. It was bad.

01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:30.500
-You did it badly, lousy.
-Liar, you didn't even see us.

01:20:30.583 --> 01:20:32.208
You left before we start.

01:20:32.291 --> 01:20:35.291
No. I stayed looking at you
from a corner.

01:20:42.958 --> 01:20:45.875
Does anyone know what
we are going to do when we get there?

01:20:46.333 --> 01:20:48.583
Well, talk to her and,

01:20:49.375 --> 01:20:50.791
make her see her mistake.

01:20:50.875 --> 01:20:53.291
Make her see her mistake?
Let's hit her together.

01:20:53.416 --> 01:20:54.708
Oh, how do you think?

01:20:54.791 --> 01:20:57.458
Let's take away all the cryptocurrency
passwords. All of them.

01:20:57.583 --> 01:20:59.208
-How?
-Hitting her, obviously.

01:20:59.291 --> 01:21:03.250
-No, no, without violence.
-Oh, she just takes all the zen out of me.

01:21:07.416 --> 01:21:10.625
Now, we officially welcome Alex,

01:21:10.708 --> 01:21:14.750
and his mother, Mariela,
to Rancagua Catholic School.

01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:17.000
And the grant takes care
of everything.

01:21:17.083 --> 01:21:20.125
So, you young man,
the only thing you have to worry about

01:21:20.666 --> 01:21:22.666
-is to study a lot.
-Yes.

01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:25.958
And most importantly,
to pray and thank

01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:27.708
Almighty God...

01:21:30.041 --> 01:21:32.708
for the generosity
He has shown to you,

01:21:32.833 --> 01:21:34.750
-the poor.
-Amen.

01:21:36.416 --> 01:21:38.541
-How incompetent you are.
-Hurry up!

01:21:38.666 --> 01:21:41.375
You handle it! Right now
I'm in an important meeting.

01:21:41.458 --> 01:21:43.125
I can't be on top of this.

01:21:43.458 --> 01:21:46.875
-No. I don't have...
-Thank you very much, really.

01:21:47.708 --> 01:21:51.375
My son and I have had
a very difficult time since he got sick.

01:21:51.958 --> 01:21:52.958
Thanks.

01:21:54.125 --> 01:21:55.500
I wanted to ask you,

01:21:55.666 --> 01:21:58.791
-are the supplies included?
-Everything. Everything is included.

01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:01.875
I'm sure it's here.

01:22:01.958 --> 01:22:04.666
-Hey, but what's going on?
-... never wrong.

01:22:05.166 --> 01:22:07.208
Well, it is not very usual for us

01:22:07.333 --> 01:22:09.666
to receive a student
at this time of the year.

01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:11.916
-Indeed.
-We could do no less,

01:22:12.041 --> 01:22:13.708
knowing your story, Alex.

01:22:14.083 --> 01:22:17.625
The strength that you have experienced,
is unprecedented.

01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:19.458
-Hallelujah!
-Also,

01:22:19.541 --> 01:22:22.916
-all this touching story.
-Oh! Stop everything!

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.208
-Who are you?
-We are the SOS MAMIS.

01:22:27.958 --> 01:22:29.250
What?

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.583
They are! They are the parents
I told you were making fun of my boy.

01:22:33.666 --> 01:22:35.916
That's why
we had to move from Santiago.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.875
-Stop the show, you crazy bitch.
-Hey!

01:22:38.416 --> 01:22:40.625
-This woman is not who she claims to be.
-No.

01:22:40.916 --> 01:22:44.000
Surely she told you the story
of the dead husband

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:46.250
and his illness.
But none of that is true.

01:22:46.625 --> 01:22:48.666
Nothing.
Not even her hair is real.

01:22:56.166 --> 01:22:57.625
Holy Virgin.

01:22:57.916 --> 01:22:59.625
You peeled like Sinéad O'connor.

01:23:00.958 --> 01:23:02.791
-How beautiful!
-Give me that.

01:23:03.708 --> 01:23:05.916
Do you remember
what I had told you about...

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.833
my illness, my treatment?

01:23:07.958 --> 01:23:09.208
That's why I'm like this.

01:23:09.291 --> 01:23:11.500
But with the donations
I was able to buy this wig.

01:23:11.583 --> 01:23:13.416
But how far do your lies go?

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:16.000
-Bald, you're a scammer.
-And a bad friend.

01:23:16.125 --> 01:23:20.250
-Worse, a hypocrite.
-Wait, I don't know who you are,

01:23:20.333 --> 01:23:22.375
but leave immediately.

01:23:22.666 --> 01:23:25.750
And you. Go find someone, man,
don't just stand there!

01:23:25.958 --> 01:23:28.250
That child walks, runs, plays tag.

01:23:28.375 --> 01:23:30.083
It's not true, I can't.
Ignore her.

01:23:30.208 --> 01:23:31.291
Yes.

01:23:31.375 --> 01:23:32.375
-Hello.
-Bye.

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.958
Are you getting down
or am I getting you down, precious

01:23:35.083 --> 01:23:37.666
-No, better not...
-Yes, come with your aunt.

01:23:39.666 --> 01:23:41.750
-Let me go!
-Yes, let him go!

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:43.500
Leave him, don't touch him.

01:23:45.791 --> 01:23:47.083
Mom!

01:23:49.583 --> 01:23:50.916
Help me, mom!

01:23:51.666 --> 01:23:52.791
The yellow cot.

01:23:53.208 --> 01:23:55.500
These women
are totally crazy.

01:23:55.625 --> 01:23:57.208
Go find the police, now!

01:23:57.291 --> 01:23:58.791
He is faking it!

01:23:58.916 --> 01:24:01.083
-He's putting on a show.
-Yes.

01:24:01.375 --> 01:24:02.541
You are wrong.

01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:04.458
-She's scamming you.
-Help me!

01:24:05.291 --> 01:24:07.583
Alex, watch out.
You have a spider!

01:24:10.291 --> 01:24:12.208
A giant spider!
It's poisonous

01:24:13.541 --> 01:24:15.250
See? I told you.

01:24:16.333 --> 01:24:18.916
But what is this?
Holy Virgin!

01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:24.375
It's a miracle!
Call the Vatican!

01:24:25.083 --> 01:24:28.958
Oh, thanks!
Thank my Lord!

01:24:29.791 --> 01:24:30.875
No.

01:24:38.375 --> 01:24:41.458
Now son, stand up.
Come on, my love, come on.

01:24:42.125 --> 01:24:45.250
They don't believe in miracles
and they pretend to be Catholics.

01:24:45.375 --> 01:24:49.166
-Hey! What did you say?
-Calm down, Milagros, please!

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:51.625
-Is not the proper way. Easy.
-No, not easy.

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:55.875
This woman committed
the crime of identity theft and fraud.

01:24:55.958 --> 01:24:57.708
She played with our feelings.

01:24:58.041 --> 01:24:59.791
With my feelings!

01:24:59.875 --> 01:25:02.291
I thought we were a coup... sisters.

01:25:02.458 --> 01:25:03.583
We were friends.

01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:05.791
Do you know
what happens to someone

01:25:05.875 --> 01:25:08.041
-who does what your mother did?
-What?

01:25:08.166 --> 01:25:12.833
The moms go to jail
and the kids go to an orphanage.

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:15.583
-What?
-No, leave him alone.

01:25:15.666 --> 01:25:18.875
Shut up. Be thankful we won't
take the child away from you now.

01:25:19.333 --> 01:25:23.166
And you, little devil,
are going to hell for being a liar.

01:25:23.291 --> 01:25:25.375
-Lie!
-Don't talk to him like that.

01:25:25.625 --> 01:25:28.416
I don't believe in hell,
but I do believe in karma.

01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:29.708
This will come back to you.

01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:31.875
-Everything you did.
-Sinner, sinner!

01:25:36.208 --> 01:25:39.125
Everything comes back.
Everything comes back in life.

01:25:45.166 --> 01:25:48.625
The need for revenge
can only be had with kindness.

01:25:49.458 --> 01:25:51.250
Otherwise, hatred grows.

01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:55.000
But kindness does not exist
when people act as a mass

01:25:55.208 --> 01:25:57.041
and just want to vent their anger.

01:25:57.208 --> 01:26:00.916
And thus begins a cycle of hate
that is impossible to break.

01:26:02.125 --> 01:26:04.208
... Grandparents, in court...

01:26:05.291 --> 01:26:07.583
The artichoke is eaten by the leaf!

01:26:07.916 --> 01:26:09.125
-What?
-Huh?

01:26:09.791 --> 01:26:11.000
Step by step, I say.

01:26:12.833 --> 01:26:14.375
Here, let me explain.

01:26:15.041 --> 01:26:18.958
We filed a police report
against this woman.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.625
And we ourselves are going
to take her now to the police

01:26:22.791 --> 01:26:25.083
to put an end
to this whole situation.

01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:28.416
Come, Daniela. Ariela, Mariela,
whatever your name is.

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:31.333
-Yeah, come on.
-Don't touch me. Do not touch me.

01:26:31.458 --> 01:26:34.041
-Now, out, out!
-Calm down, calm down!

01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:36.333
Everyone in calm,
in peace and harmony.

01:26:36.958 --> 01:26:39.750
Thank you very much. Sorry.
Sorry, really, sorry.

01:26:40.041 --> 01:26:42.166
-May God catch us confessed.
-So be it.

01:26:46.125 --> 01:26:47.291
What a day!

01:26:55.833 --> 01:26:57.833
-Where is the money, Manuela?
-Daniela.

01:26:57.958 --> 01:26:59.166
-Gabriela.
-Mariela!

01:26:59.250 --> 01:27:01.833
-Yanela?
-Whatever. Where is it?

01:27:02.833 --> 01:27:05.250
It's all in cryptocurrency,
as you taught me.

01:27:05.333 --> 01:27:07.416
-I knew it. Give me the phone.
-Now.

01:27:07.708 --> 01:27:09.708
-Give me.
-Oh, I'm so hot.

01:27:09.833 --> 01:27:11.500
-Me too.
-Yeah, me too.

01:27:11.708 --> 01:27:14.208
-Face ID.
-Ok.

01:27:14.916 --> 01:27:17.125
It doesn't recognize you
with that awful wig.

01:27:17.208 --> 01:27:21.000
-Password.
-8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8.

01:27:23.541 --> 01:27:27.958
Wow, they rented 45%.
Congratulations.

01:27:28.333 --> 01:27:30.208
-Thank you.
-I'm proud of you, marvelous.

01:27:30.291 --> 01:27:31.375
Julia!

01:27:31.458 --> 01:27:33.375
-Make the transfer, please.
-Oh, ok.

01:27:37.958 --> 01:27:39.125
I have the money.

01:27:39.208 --> 01:27:41.208
Oh, finally!
Wonderful!

01:27:42.125 --> 01:27:44.875
Now can you let us go?
We won't bother you anymore...

01:27:44.958 --> 01:27:46.583
Do you think we are stupid?

01:27:46.708 --> 01:27:48.083
We'll let you free for what?

01:27:48.208 --> 01:27:50.375
To fool other fools?

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.000
I mean, naive women.

01:27:57.416 --> 01:27:59.958
-What happened?
-Trini!

01:28:01.416 --> 01:28:02.708
We need to talk.

01:28:08.708 --> 01:28:10.375
We're not taking her
to the police station.

01:28:10.458 --> 01:28:13.166
-Oh, no? Are we going to do what I said?
- No! No.

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.375
Have you heard
of the circle of hate?

01:28:18.416 --> 01:28:22.166
We are in a circle,
in a circle of revenge,

01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:24.583
violence, lack of control, right?

01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:26.916
If we punish her,

01:28:27.041 --> 01:28:29.625
she'll return to the world
with more rage, angrier.

01:28:29.708 --> 01:28:31.291
So, this circle is not broken.

01:28:31.375 --> 01:28:33.875
You need to listen
to Pepe Manzana's podcast, it's great.

01:28:33.958 --> 01:28:35.208
He is Sofi's guru.

01:28:35.291 --> 01:28:38.291
She explains it amazingly,
even in tongues, but let's see...

01:28:40.375 --> 01:28:43.208
Basically,
I want you to understand

01:28:43.875 --> 01:28:46.458
that depends on each one of us

01:28:47.583 --> 01:28:49.041
to end this madness.

01:28:50.166 --> 01:28:52.708
-Mom, I'm scared.
-Now, calm down.

01:28:55.875 --> 01:28:58.458
I bet people can change.

01:28:58.916 --> 01:29:00.083
And you girls?

01:29:15.833 --> 01:29:18.958
Well and... so,
what are we going to do?

01:29:22.666 --> 01:29:23.666
Daniela.

01:29:25.666 --> 01:29:28.583
This is the moment
when you have to make a decision.

01:29:28.666 --> 01:29:30.583
You can continue
with this life of lies

01:29:31.416 --> 01:29:33.458
or take a path to change your life.

01:29:33.625 --> 01:29:36.083
Your life and your Puppy's life.

01:29:37.083 --> 01:29:38.958
One that allows Alex to choose

01:29:39.041 --> 01:29:42.000
who he wants to be,
where he can express himself.

01:29:42.416 --> 01:29:45.250
And give him the opportunity
to be part of our community,

01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:48.833
where he can love,
and be loved.

01:29:50.333 --> 01:29:53.583
Having a circle of love,
that finally...

01:29:55.166 --> 01:29:57.291
...is what gives
meaning to life, isn't it?

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.166
How nice!

01:29:59.958 --> 01:30:01.708
Is that also from
the man of the apples?

01:30:01.791 --> 01:30:02.875
Pepe.

01:30:03.333 --> 01:30:04.458
My guru.

01:30:07.458 --> 01:30:08.666
What do you say?

01:30:23.625 --> 01:30:25.458
Bravo!

01:30:28.166 --> 01:30:29.583
Thank you very much.

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:31.916
Well, and with this ribbon cutting,

01:30:32.041 --> 01:30:35.250
we inaugurate the renew
nursery home "Grandpa, tell me you",

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:38.541
reconstructed by
the Vicuña Montt Foundation,

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:41.500
-which I have the honor of chairing.
-Bravo!

01:30:43.416 --> 01:30:45.541
And well, of course,
with the collaboration

01:30:45.625 --> 01:30:47.291
of the Saint Michael School.

01:30:47.708 --> 01:30:48.750
Bravo!

01:30:49.041 --> 01:30:50.791
And some private ones.

01:30:51.208 --> 01:30:52.500
Private like me.

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.166
Do not waste more time.
Get him off the team now.

01:30:59.166 --> 01:31:03.041
Of course, none of this
would have been possible

01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:05.166
without the help of...

01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:09.166
Without the collaboration...

01:31:11.458 --> 01:31:13.958
-Without the enthusiasm?
-Planning.

01:31:14.666 --> 01:31:15.875
And governance.

01:31:16.333 --> 01:31:17.375
The...

01:31:17.708 --> 01:31:18.666
Implementation.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.041
-Implementation.
-All that from Trini,

01:31:22.416 --> 01:31:24.958
-Milagros...
-The SOS MAMIS.

01:31:25.416 --> 01:31:26.500
Right.

01:31:27.125 --> 01:31:30.500
We also thank Daniela and Clarita...

01:31:30.625 --> 01:31:32.583
Ooh!
Very good!

01:31:32.708 --> 01:31:35.875
they built, side by side,
this reconstruction.

01:31:35.958 --> 01:31:36.958
Bravo!

01:31:38.666 --> 01:31:41.125
It was four months
of hard work.

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:43.750
We didn't even rest on weekends.

01:31:43.833 --> 01:31:45.208
But after all that,

01:31:45.416 --> 01:31:49.500
now we are BFF,
Best Friends Forever.

01:31:49.708 --> 01:31:51.458
The best friends forever.

01:31:52.708 --> 01:31:53.750
Bravo!

01:31:54.333 --> 01:31:55.958
Ok, grandpa,
where's the candy?

01:31:56.875 --> 01:31:59.125
And also Daniela,

01:31:59.208 --> 01:32:01.500
she is a volunteer here
at the nursery home

01:32:01.583 --> 01:32:05.041
and she supports the grandparents
who need her so much.

01:32:05.541 --> 01:32:06.791
An applause.

01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:09.958
Paid volunteer
at the expense of my foundation.

01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:11.958
Right.

01:32:12.041 --> 01:32:13.125
We did it well.

01:32:13.958 --> 01:32:16.250
Let's get together now

01:32:16.541 --> 01:32:18.708
in a prayer to bless

01:32:19.041 --> 01:32:22.375
this remarkable piece of work.
Oh, God...

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.083
I warn you, Luna, sit down.

01:32:26.208 --> 01:32:28.250
-Puppy.
-Where is it, where is it?

01:32:30.458 --> 01:32:32.833
I love that Alex and you
are now friends.

01:32:34.291 --> 01:32:37.375
Since he told everyone that it was
a lie about the drawings,

01:32:37.666 --> 01:32:39.583
the circle of hate was broken.

01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:41.666
How wonderful,
Mommy's puppy.

01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:43.333
The future belongs to children.

01:32:44.666 --> 01:32:46.458
-Hey, but you guys are...
-Mom?

01:32:46.541 --> 01:32:47.541
What?

01:32:47.625 --> 01:32:50.375
-Now we're in collusion.
-Colluded?

01:32:51.583 --> 01:32:53.458
That's illegal, my love.

01:32:53.625 --> 01:32:55.875
No, mom.
We are letting them win.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.166
All the glasses
have a candy underneath.

01:32:59.708 --> 01:33:01.875
Puppy, you know it's wrong

01:33:01.958 --> 01:33:03.583
to deceive people. Right?

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.083
Yes, mom. But in this case,
we are not fooling them.

01:33:07.791 --> 01:33:09.458
We are giving them happiness.

01:33:14.458 --> 01:33:15.708
Very good, my love, ok.

01:33:16.583 --> 01:33:17.791
Love you.

01:33:20.708 --> 01:33:23.666
And now, the icing on the cake.

01:33:23.875 --> 01:33:25.125
Trini, Trini, come, come!

01:33:25.208 --> 01:33:27.500
-Now what?
-I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:33:27.791 --> 01:33:31.250
Now, we are going to amend
the last dance performance

01:33:31.375 --> 01:33:32.791
which was full of errors.

01:33:32.916 --> 01:33:34.791
Very amateurish.

01:33:35.958 --> 01:33:37.916
So the message could not be

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.708
faithfully conveyed in full.

01:33:39.791 --> 01:33:41.375
You can't be serious.

01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:44.708
I'm dead serious.

01:33:45.208 --> 01:33:46.333
Yes.

01:33:47.083 --> 01:33:48.125
Now?

01:33:48.208 --> 01:33:49.291
I'll let you know.

01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:34.000
Tell me now,
you need to rest,

01:34:34.125 --> 01:34:36.916
Tell me now, waiting is too long

01:34:37.875 --> 01:34:40.916
Because it's going to happen,
the summer of love,

01:34:42.041 --> 01:34:45.791
I know it's gonna happen,
the sexual revolution.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.250
And you've known for days,

01:34:49.708 --> 01:34:52.125
Sometimes you don't have to be right.

01:34:58.958 --> 01:35:00.458
Are you ready to go?

01:35:00.958 --> 01:35:04.625
You who decided
that your life was not worth it,

01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:08.708
Who inclined to feel bad all the time,

01:35:09.708 --> 01:35:12.583
Who anticipated a catastrophic future,

01:35:13.833 --> 01:35:16.375
Today you predict the sexual revolution.

01:35:16.791 --> 01:35:20.416
You who decided
that your love was no longer useful,

01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:24.208
Who preferred to make up your identity,

01:35:25.416 --> 01:35:28.291
Today you prepare
for the most fantastic blow

01:35:28.958 --> 01:35:31.083
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:35:35.958 --> 01:35:39.083
Let it go now, don't try to mislead,

01:35:40.083 --> 01:35:43.041
Let it go, who do you want to fool,

01:35:43.208 --> 01:35:45.208
Because it's going to happen...

01:35:45.708 --> 01:35:47.916
-I love this song.
-Me too.

01:35:48.041 --> 01:35:51.208
Today we will talk about
friendship and forgiveness.

01:35:51.625 --> 01:35:53.333
In apologizing and forgiving,

01:35:53.541 --> 01:35:55.500
the friendship becomes stronger.

01:35:55.833 --> 01:35:58.750
The people get most real
and the soul lightest,

01:35:59.666 --> 01:36:01.000
like light music.

01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:03.708
As our colleague Marian Rojas says:

01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:06.500
Forgiveness
is like traveling to past

01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:09.083
and return safe and sound.

01:36:09.333 --> 01:36:11.958
And up to here,
my light moment of reflection...

01:36:12.041 --> 01:36:13.708
My God, what a wise man.

01:36:13.791 --> 01:36:15.000
And now,
the main event,

01:36:15.125 --> 01:36:18.833
which is the one who has won
the snack with Pepe Mari Manzanares.

01:36:19.041 --> 01:36:21.750
And the winner

01:36:21.958 --> 01:36:22.958
is...

01:36:26.416 --> 01:36:28.750
Sofi Emo 21.

01:36:28.875 --> 01:36:29.958
Congratulations!

01:36:30.083 --> 01:36:33.250
You are the winner of the snack
with Pepe Mari Manzanares.

01:36:38.333 --> 01:36:39.833
Principality of Asturias
Spain

01:36:49.166 --> 01:36:51.250
We are not in red.
We are not in red.

01:36:51.333 --> 01:36:52.958
We are not in red.

01:37:13.541 --> 01:37:15.541
-Hello?
-Hello?

01:37:16.958 --> 01:37:18.375
Anyone home?

01:37:20.166 --> 01:37:21.666
What a rustic house, isn't it?

01:37:23.666 --> 01:37:24.791
-Hi.
-Hello.

01:37:24.916 --> 01:37:27.500
We are looking for
Don Pepe Mari Manzanares.

01:37:27.708 --> 01:37:28.958
Will this be his abode?

01:37:29.083 --> 01:37:31.916
Dad! Here is the annoying one
for the snack.

01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:33.666
It is the daughter!

01:37:33.791 --> 01:37:35.250
The heiress of Manzanares!

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:37.291
Excuse me!

01:37:42.833 --> 01:37:44.916
Sofi Emo 21.

01:37:46.208 --> 01:37:47.416
Oh, it's you.

01:37:48.041 --> 01:37:49.875
Sit to the right
of Pepe Mari Manzanares.

01:37:49.958 --> 01:37:52.000
And you here,
whoever you are.

01:37:53.583 --> 01:37:56.375
You who decided
that your life was not worth it,

01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.958
Who inclined to feel bad all the time,

01:38:01.541 --> 01:38:04.166
Who anticipated a catastrophic future,

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:08.208
Today you predict the sexual revolution.

01:38:08.791 --> 01:38:11.916
You who decided that your love
was no longer useful,

01:38:13.333 --> 01:38:15.875
Who preferred to make up your identity,

01:38:17.458 --> 01:38:20.375
Today you prepare
for the most fantastic blow

01:38:21.375 --> 01:38:23.875
Because today
the sexual revolution begins.

01:38:34.125 --> 01:38:35.166
And you are?

01:38:35.291 --> 01:38:36.875
I am Trinidad Necochea.

01:38:36.958 --> 01:38:39.083
Nice to meet you.
I'm Sofi Emo 21's mom.

01:38:39.166 --> 01:38:40.375
We come from Chile.

01:38:41.125 --> 01:38:43.833
Welcome to Pepe Mari Manzanares' snack.

01:38:44.333 --> 01:38:46.833
Churros, marañueles
and casadielles.

01:38:47.958 --> 01:38:49.041
How delicious!

01:38:49.333 --> 01:38:51.375
We also brought a gift.

01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:54.333
A typical small detail,
we bought it at Duty Free.

01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:57.666
Everything was so fast, a surprise,
but it's a local craft.

01:38:59.041 --> 01:39:00.375
What's this?

01:39:02.208 --> 01:39:04.625
I swear I was completely unaware
of that detail.

01:39:04.708 --> 01:39:07.000
Sofia, please take it out.
Did you know?

01:39:09.375 --> 01:39:11.041
Oops, what a bad time.

01:39:11.333 --> 01:39:13.791
This is for Sofi Emo 21,
the winner.

01:39:22.708 --> 01:39:24.750
But how can you bring him that gift!

01:39:27.833 --> 01:39:30.625
The Pig told me to bring him
a Chilean handicraft!

01:39:31.125 --> 01:39:34.041
Your subconscious played
a trick on you with your "guru"...

01:39:36.583 --> 01:39:39.333
How inappropriate, Luna!
I only have eyes for my Pig.

01:39:39.875 --> 01:39:42.500
Oh, Trini! More than
1,000 kilometers does not count.

01:39:43.208 --> 01:39:46.333
What's bill? I'm up to date. Or am I?
Sorry, I'm at the cinema.

01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:48.833
With the phone on?
How disrespectful.

01:39:48.916 --> 01:39:51.083
Cause of people like you,
I only watch streaming.

01:39:51.166 --> 01:39:54.166
The movie is over. I'm watching
the end credits...

01:39:54.250 --> 01:39:56.666
Do you stay to watch the end credits?

01:39:56.916 --> 01:39:59.125
Yes, I feel guilty leaving early,
poor people.

01:39:59.208 --> 01:40:00.833
So much work
and nobody reads their names.

01:40:00.916 --> 01:40:03.333
Well, that depends on the movie....
Right?

01:40:04.041 --> 01:40:05.333
This one was very nice.

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:08.166
It's about some women
who had to face...

01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:09.875
CLARA HAS BEEN SILENCED...
