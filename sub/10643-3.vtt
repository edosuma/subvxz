02:12.590 --> 02:13.216

03:14.485 --> 03:15.361
{\an1}And I notice that my boy Nicky

03:15.445 --> 03:16.321
{\an1}fell behind.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.122
{\an1}We get in there.

03:26.205 --> 03:27.123

03:38.051 --> 03:38.760

03:40.470 --> 03:42.305
{\an1}So I come out the bathroom, and

03:47.685 --> 03:48.853
{\an1}Or actually it was--like a

03:55.360 --> 03:56.027

03:57.278 --> 03:58.237
{\an1}She starts getting close.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.197
{\an1}And then all of the sudden, I

{\an1}don't know how it happened, how

04:00.406 --> 04:01.407

04:02.700 --> 04:03.284

04:08.957 --> 04:10.625
{\an1}Until the front door slams

04:10.708 --> 04:12.710
{\an1}open--boom, kids come in.

04:12.794 --> 04:13.795
{\an1}They're a little saucy.

04:13.878 --> 04:14.879
{\an1}The first kid I kinda recognize.

04:14.963 --> 04:15.630
{\an1}I can't put my finger on it

04:15.713 --> 04:16.464
{\an1}though.

04:16.547 --> 04:17.714
{\an1}The second kid walks in, and

04:17.798 --> 04:18.632
{\an1}it's the girl Kaitlyn's

04:18.716 --> 04:20.593
{\an1}boyfriend from earlier.

04:20.677 --> 04:21.344
{\an1}I have no idea how he found me.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.388
{\an1}But this kid is out of his mind.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.098
{\an1}So I look at my boys, I'm like,

04:25.181 --> 04:26.599
{\an1}"Dip, dip, dip, gone."

04:26.683 --> 04:27.392
{\an1}I book it out the backyard.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.394
{\an1}I'm a lover, not a fighter.

04:29.477 --> 04:30.353
{\an1}I hop over the fence.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.270
{\an1}They come after me.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.313
{\an1}The kid's still chasing us.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.231
{\an1}Somehow I lose him.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.774
{\an1}We're on our way out of there,

04:34.857 --> 04:36.859
{\an1}and I go on Facebook, and I have

04:36.943 --> 04:38.194
{\an1}a Facebook message.

04:38.277 --> 04:38.611
{\an1}It was from the kid.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.071
{\an1}I guess somewhere there knew my

04:40.154 --> 04:40.613
{\an1}name.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.823
{\an1}But the Facebook message says...

04:47.870 --> 04:49.789

05:25.908 --> 05:27.326
{\an1}of the most magical theme parks

05:27.410 --> 05:28.161
{\an1}in the country.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.079
{\an1}And you know we weren't going to

05:30.163 --> 05:30.913
{\an1}go sober.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.165
{\an1}So we stayed up 'til 3 o'clock

05:32.248 --> 05:33.958
{\an1}in the morning and made little

05:34.042 --> 05:35.710
{\an1}magical edible buddies that we

05:35.793 --> 05:37.754
{\an1}decided to bring along with us.

05:37.837 --> 05:38.588
{\an1}So they put us all on a bus

05:38.671 --> 05:39.547
{\an1}together at 9 o'clock in the

05:39.630 --> 05:40.339
{\an1}morning.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.632
{\an1}When we got to the park, this

05:41.716 --> 05:43.051
{\an1}girl had sort of latched onto

05:43.134 --> 05:43.885
{\an1}Kelsey.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.136
{\an1}And her name was Lola.

05:45.219 --> 05:46.554
{\an1}She seemed like a normal person.

05:46.637 --> 05:47.430
{\an1}Anyway, we arrive

05:47.513 --> 05:49.182
{\an1}to the theme park.

05:49.265 --> 05:49.849
{\an1}All right, it's time for us to

05:49.932 --> 05:51.184
{\an1}partake.

05:51.267 --> 05:52.602
{\an1}Lola comes up to us, "Are those

05:52.685 --> 05:53.644
{\an1}edible cakes?"

05:53.728 --> 05:55.480
{\an1}"Yeah, man, take one."

05:55.563 --> 05:56.647
{\an1}So we give her like maybe like

05:56.731 --> 05:57.440
{\an1}this much.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.232
{\an1}Like just a corner.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.692
{\an1}I ate one the size of my head.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.152
{\an1}This is gonna be fantastic.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.195
{\an1}We decide we're going to go on,

06:02.278 --> 06:04.197
{\an1}um, Pirate's Ocean.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.156
{\an1}Everything's starting to kick

06:05.239 --> 06:05.907
{\an1}in.

06:05.990 --> 06:06.699
{\an1}I'm already starting to have

06:06.783 --> 06:08.493
{\an1}that feeling of like, "Is this a

06:08.576 --> 06:10.119
{\an1}"normal place to put my hand?

06:10.203 --> 06:11.329
{\an1}"I'm not really sure.

06:11.412 --> 06:12.371
{\an1}"Do I still have my purse?

06:12.455 --> 06:13.164
{\an1}"I can't believe this is

06:13.247 --> 06:14.791
{\an1}happening right now."

06:14.874 --> 06:15.958
{\an1}And we get off the ride, and I

06:16.042 --> 06:16.959
{\an1}all of the sudden, I just hear

06:17.043 --> 06:18.711
{\an1}Kelsey's voice go, "Laura,

06:18.795 --> 06:19.712
{\an1}Laura, stop.

06:19.796 --> 06:20.546
{\an1}Laura."

06:20.630 --> 06:22.173
{\an1}And I turn around, and Lola is

06:22.256 --> 06:23.716
{\an1}just on the ground in the middle

06:23.800 --> 06:24.884
{\an1}of the off ramp.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.219
{\an1}And she looks up at me,

06:26.302 --> 06:28.179
{\an1}"I'm dying. I'm dying.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.263
{\an1}"Like I'm moving through space,

06:29.347 --> 06:30.098
{\an1}"and like I don't even

06:30.181 --> 06:30.932
{\an1}"understand what

06:31.015 --> 06:31.766
{\an1}"space really is.

06:31.849 --> 06:32.934
{\an1}"Like these thoughts in my head,

06:33.017 --> 06:33.643
{\an1}"I don't even know what I'm

06:33.726 --> 06:34.560
{\an1}thinking."

06:34.644 --> 06:35.937
{\an1}"Okay, you're high.

06:36.020 --> 06:36.854
{\an1}It's gonna be okay."

06:36.938 --> 06:38.147
{\an1}"I've never been high."

06:38.231 --> 06:39.357
{\an1}Everybody was looking at us.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.025
{\an1}We were blocking the entire exit

06:41.109 --> 06:42.026
{\an1}of this ride.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.195
{\an1}So we take her over to this like

06:44.278 --> 06:45.279
{\an1}little seating area, and there's

06:45.363 --> 06:46.489
{\an1}this woman sitting there.

06:46.572 --> 06:47.657
{\an1}"Children, children.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.700
{\an1}"She's saying she's dying,

06:49.784 --> 06:50.660
{\an1}"so you should take her to the

06:50.743 --> 06:51.911
{\an1}hospital."

06:51.994 --> 06:53.162
{\an1}So we take her.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.539
{\an1}And the doors of the hospital

06:54.622 --> 06:55.706
{\an1}open.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.582
{\an1}And then this nurse comes up to

06:56.666 --> 06:57.375
{\an1}us.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.794
{\an1}She was just so creepy.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.087
{\an1}It was like she knew something.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.088
{\an1}"Hey, I have brownies in my

07:02.171 --> 07:02.922
{\an1}"backpack.

07:03.005 --> 07:03.673
{\an1}"Like should we do something

07:03.756 --> 07:05.591
{\an1}about that?"

07:05.675 --> 07:06.467
{\an1}We're tearing out of this

07:06.551 --> 07:08.261
{\an1}hospital, sprinting through the

07:08.344 --> 07:09.095
{\an1}park.

07:09.178 --> 07:09.887
{\an1}I look to my left, and I see

07:09.971 --> 07:10.972
{\an1}this little kid on a leash.

07:11.055 --> 07:11.973
{\an1}And he's looking at me.

07:12.056 --> 07:13.057
{\an1}And I look to my right, and

07:13.141 --> 07:14.475
{\an1}there's this guy wearing like a

07:14.559 --> 07:15.560
{\an1}big mascot costume.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.061
{\an1}Like he's looking at me.

07:17.145 --> 07:17.937
{\an1}So we start ducking behind

07:18.020 --> 07:18.980
{\an1}trash cans.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.314
{\an1}And like everyone in the park is

07:20.398 --> 07:21.607
{\an1}clearly looking at us.

07:21.691 --> 07:22.358
{\an1}"You have drugs in your

07:22.441 --> 07:23.484
{\an1}"backpack.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.777
{\an1}"And there are children around.

07:24.861 --> 07:25.862
{\an1}That's not okay."

07:25.945 --> 07:27.613
{\an1}We eventually sort of land in

07:27.697 --> 07:29.574
{\an1}this space-themed area.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.617
{\an1}And I see this Jedi Knight, and

07:31.701 --> 07:32.660
{\an1}he's taking down this Storm

07:32.743 --> 07:34.829
{\an1}Trooper with just no fear.

07:34.912 --> 07:35.997
{\an1}And I'm like, "He would not

07:36.080 --> 07:37.790
{\an1}"leave this poor girl Lola alone

07:37.874 --> 07:39.417
{\an1}in a themed hospital.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.543
{\an1}What would a Jedi do?"

07:40.626 --> 07:41.669
{\an1}"What are you talking about?"

07:41.752 --> 07:42.920
{\an1}"What would a Jedi do?"

07:43.004 --> 07:44.338
{\an1}"I don't know what you mean."

07:44.422 --> 07:45.339
{\an1}"What I'm saying is we should go

07:45.423 --> 07:46.465
{\an1}back to the hospital."

07:46.549 --> 07:47.592
{\an1}So we eventually found our way

07:47.675 --> 07:48.885
{\an1}back to the hospital.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.053
{\an1}And Lola's all happy.

07:51.137 --> 07:51.929
{\an1}"Oh my God, guys, like I'm so

07:52.013 --> 07:53.723
{\an1}"excited to go on the rides.

07:53.806 --> 07:54.640
{\an1}"Like I'm totally fine.

07:54.724 --> 07:55.516
{\an1}"I'm like so sorry.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.018
{\an1}Like I'm so sorry."

07:57.101 --> 07:58.895
{\an1}And we decided to go on the

07:58.978 --> 08:00.271
{\an1}Mountain of Space.

08:00.354 --> 08:01.397
{\an1}We go on the ride.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.732
{\an1}Those three minutes that we were

08:02.815 --> 08:04.317
{\an1}zooming through techno space, it

08:04.400 --> 08:06.068
{\an1}made it all worth it.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.236
{\an1}And if there's one thing I say I

08:07.320 --> 08:09.280
{\an1}took away from this day, don't

08:09.363 --> 08:10.573
{\an1}eat a brownie the size of your

08:10.656 --> 08:11.991
{\an1}head before you go into a

08:12.074 --> 08:13.451
{\an1}children's amusement park,

08:13.534 --> 08:14.368
{\an1}because all your dreams might

08:14.452 --> 08:14.869
{\an1}not come true.

08:14.952 --> 08:15.786
{\an1}They might just turn into

08:15.870 --> 08:17.580
{\an1}nightmares.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.373
{\an1}>> [wind rushing]

08:20.958 --> 08:22.960
{\an1}>> ♪

08:23.044 --> 08:23.586
{\an1}>> So we're at this big

08:23.669 --> 08:24.629
{\an1}fraternity meeting.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.255
{\an1}And Sharon contacts me.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.548
{\an1}Yo know, she's light skinned,

08:27.632 --> 08:28.966
{\an1}long, black hair.

08:29.050 --> 08:29.967
{\an1}Her face kinda looks like a

08:30.051 --> 08:30.801
{\an1}gerbil.

08:30.885 --> 08:31.677
{\an1}She has a gerbil face, but it's

08:31.761 --> 08:32.428
{\an1}cute though.

08:32.510 --> 08:33.638
{\an1}She got like little freckles.

08:33.721 --> 08:34.514
{\an1}I didn't have a car, so I

08:34.597 --> 08:36.140
{\an1}pleaded to my boys to take me.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.433
{\an1}She's got other friends from her

08:37.515 --> 08:38.768
{\an1}sorority, like we're all gonna

08:38.851 --> 08:39.602
{\an1}eat tonight.

08:39.684 --> 08:41.145
{\an1}You know what I'm saying?

08:41.229 --> 08:43.606
{\an1}It's me, Mooch and Josh.

08:43.688 --> 08:45.316
{\an1}Mooch, he's from Zimbabwe.

08:45.399 --> 08:46.025
{\an1}And I don't know why, but he

08:46.108 --> 08:47.109
{\an1}just looks like a penguin.

08:47.193 --> 08:47.944
{\an1}And he's always like pointing

08:48.027 --> 08:48.736
{\an1}his fingers to the sky.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.363
{\an1}"Hey, turn up," like that.

08:50.446 --> 08:51.739
{\an1}"Let's go, let's go!

08:51.822 --> 08:52.740
{\an1}Turn up!"

08:52.823 --> 08:53.658
{\an1}Now when we walk in, we're

08:53.741 --> 08:54.825
{\an1}expecting to see people like

08:54.909 --> 08:55.743
{\an1}dancing and doing their little

08:55.826 --> 08:57.286
{\an1}thing and whatever.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.955
{\an1}All's I see is Sharon, who's

08:59.038 --> 09:00.206
{\an1}opened the door, her friend

09:00.289 --> 09:02.458
{\an1}lying on a couch.

09:02.541 --> 09:03.709
{\an1}And directly in front of us is

09:03.793 --> 09:05.628
{\an1}this big, brooding, bear-like

09:05.711 --> 09:06.879
{\an1}creature.

09:06.963 --> 09:07.880
{\an1}It had like this purple and

09:07.964 --> 09:09.048
{\an1}white Jordans.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.007
{\an1}And I kinda wanted to get them.

09:10.091 --> 09:10.841
{\an1}I was like, "A'ight, them

09:10.925 --> 09:12.009
{\an1}Jordans look pretty tight."

09:12.093 --> 09:13.594
{\an1}And he's just sitting there.

09:13.678 --> 09:14.553
{\an1}[snorting]

09:14.637 --> 09:16.264
{\an1}Like he couldn't wait for lunch.

09:16.347 --> 09:16.889
{\an1}So my friends are like, "All

09:16.973 --> 09:17.598
{\an1}"right, we're getting the hell

09:17.682 --> 09:18.224
{\an1}out of there."

09:18.307 --> 09:19.267
{\an1}They're starting to turn around.

09:19.350 --> 09:19.976
{\an1}"Come on, man, do this for me,

09:20.059 --> 09:20.601
{\an1}"man.

09:20.685 --> 09:21.519
{\an1}We're supposed to be brothers."

09:21.602 --> 09:22.228
{\an1}"I don't know, man.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.271
{\an1}You gotta promise me this ain't

09:23.354 --> 09:24.188
{\an1}gonna be some bull."

09:24.272 --> 09:24.814
{\an1}"I promise, dude.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.023
{\an1}I promise."

09:26.107 --> 09:27.733
{\an1}We all sit down to this big

09:27.817 --> 09:29.026
{\an1}dinner table to play the game

09:29.110 --> 09:29.694
{\an1}Kings.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.195
{\an1}Like she was sitting next to me.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.280
{\an1}She would like put her leg on my

09:32.363 --> 09:34.240
{\an1}leg.

09:34.323 --> 09:34.991
{\an1}And I wasn't moving.

09:35.074 --> 09:35.700
{\an1}I was--'cause I was just

09:35.783 --> 09:36.534
{\an1}looking at him the whole time.

09:36.617 --> 09:37.493
{\an1}Just, you know?

09:37.576 --> 09:39.245
{\an1}Like I think I may have twitched

09:39.328 --> 09:39.954
{\an1}or something, and he's like

09:40.037 --> 09:40.871
{\an1}that.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.331
{\an1}Just like look.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.708
{\an1}[laughs] I'm just ooh.

09:43.791 --> 09:44.625
{\an1}[laughs] But my hand right back

09:44.709 --> 09:45.501
{\an1}on the table.

09:45.584 --> 09:46.460
{\an1}"Oh, this is, uh, play some more

09:46.544 --> 09:47.336
{\an1}cards."

09:47.420 --> 09:48.963
{\an1}So it's the end of the game.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.172
{\an1}Sharon picks up the card.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.299
{\an1}It's the last king.

09:51.382 --> 09:52.633
{\an1}"Oh God."

09:52.717 --> 09:54.135
{\an1}"Turn up kings!"

09:54.218 --> 09:55.344
{\an1}All right.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.220
{\an1}And she looks at me, she's like,

09:56.304 --> 09:58.139
{\an1}"Brandon, like you got--you

09:58.222 --> 09:58.931
{\an1}"gotta take half.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.599
{\an1}Like I can't drink all of this."

10:00.683 --> 10:01.559
{\an1}I wanted to be that man.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.311
{\an1}I wanted to put on the cape.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.395
{\an1}But I kept looking at it.

10:04.478 --> 10:05.313
{\an1}The quantity.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.605
{\an1}And I was like, "Okay.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.357
{\an1}"Um, I--you know, I don't know

10:08.441 --> 10:10.401
{\an1}"if I should be doing that,

10:10.484 --> 10:11.527
{\an1}"because, you know, alcohol

15:43.692 --> 15:43.984

15:44.068 --> 15:45.944

15:46.987 --> 15:48.947

15:49.031 --> 15:49.573

15:49.657 --> 15:50.366
{\an1}"Do you walk in your sleep?"

15:50.449 --> 15:52.242
{\an1}"Oh, sleepwalk, yeah, no, no,

15:53.077 --> 15:53.535
{\an1}"Yeah, you do last night."

15:53.619 --> 15:54.495

15:56.455 --> 15:57.122

15:57.206 --> 15:57.998
{\an1}"drunk.

15:58.082 --> 15:58.624
{\an1}"And then you come to the middle

15:58.707 --> 16:00.209

16:00.292 --> 16:00.417

16:00.501 --> 16:01.794
{\an1}"And then you go to my friend

16:01.877 --> 16:03.003
{\an1}"over in his bed, and he is very

16:03.087 --> 16:03.671
{\an1}"afraid.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.089
{\an1}"So then you climb off my friend

16:05.172 --> 16:06.590
{\an1}"and then onto the window sill.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.967
{\an1}"And you're going 'Ahhhh.'

16:09.051 --> 16:10.094
{\an1}"And then you run out the door.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.345
{\an1}"Forty-five minutes, then you

16:11.428 --> 16:12.096

16:12.805 --> 16:13.389
{\an1}"I open it, you say thank you.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.390
{\an1}"And then you go to bed.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.307
{\an1}And now we are here."

16:15.391 --> 16:16.809
{\an1}I think to myself, "He has got

16:16.892 --> 16:18.352

16:18.435 --> 16:19.812
{\an1}So I then decide I might as well

16:19.895 --> 16:20.145
{\an1}go downstairs.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.772
{\an1}And then when the elevator doors

16:21.855 --> 16:23.440
{\an1}open, that's when I knew the

16:23.524 --> 16:25.359
{\an1}story was true.

16:25.442 --> 16:26.568
{\an1}What did I do?

16:26.652 --> 16:27.486
{\an1}"Hi, mate. You remember me?"

16:27.569 --> 16:28.487
{\an1}"Yeah, you're the bouncer from

16:28.570 --> 16:29.780
{\an1}the bar last night."

16:29.863 --> 16:30.489
{\an1}"Yeah, I kicked you out because

16:30.572 --> 16:31.198
{\an1}"you was too drunk.

16:31.281 --> 16:31.699
{\an1}"You weren't gone long.

16:31.782 --> 16:32.700
{\an1}"And the next thing I know, you

16:32.783 --> 16:34.827
{\an1}came back, and you was naked."

16:34.910 --> 16:36.578
{\an1}Oh, God.

16:36.662 --> 16:37.705
{\an1}"So then you went up to the bar,

16:37.788 --> 16:38.497
{\an1}"trying to order a beer.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.289
{\an1}"And I didn't know what to do

16:39.373 --> 16:40.082
{\an1}"with ya, 'cause you was way too

16:40.165 --> 16:41.291
{\an1}"drunk to punch, and you're too

16:41.375 --> 16:42.543
{\an1}"naked to grab.

16:42.626 --> 16:43.168

16:43.252 --> 16:44.336
{\an1}"to like corral ya.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.087
{\an1}"But then you didn't know which

16:45.170 --> 16:46.171
{\an1}room you was in, didn't ya?"

16:46.255 --> 16:48.090
{\an1}I was like, "No, I don't."

16:48.173 --> 16:48.674
{\an1}I should have wrote it down on

16:48.757 --> 16:49.591
{\an1}my arm, I don't know.

16:49.675 --> 16:50.300

16:51.427 --> 16:52.761
