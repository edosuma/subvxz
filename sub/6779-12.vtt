00:06.340 --> 00:08.592
( theme music playing )

01:53.080 --> 01:55.332
( groaning )

01:58.480 --> 02:00.414
SHE'S CROWNING.
SHE'S CROWNING.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.011
- ( gasps )
- OKAY, YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.180
JUST RELAX.
EASY.

02:06.290 --> 02:08.679
- BREATHE.
- ( whimpering )

02:10.030 --> 02:12.897
YOU'RE DOING FINE.
JUST KEEP BREATHING.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.093
( exhales )

02:15.200 --> 02:17.293
- ( sloshing )
- ( groans )

02:17.400 --> 02:19.664
( heart monitor
beeping rapidly)

02:21.240 --> 02:23.208
WHY ISN'T SHE CRYING?

02:23.310 --> 02:26.609
SHE JUST NEEDS A LITTLE HELP
GETTING HER AIRWAYS OPEN.

02:26.710 --> 02:29.975
- SHE'S NOT BREATHING!
- WE'RE GONNA HELP GET
HER BREATHING.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.548
( beeping slows )

02:33.720 --> 02:35.642
OKAY...

02:42.530 --> 02:45.829
- IS SHE ALIVE?
- Doctor: YES, SHE'S ALIVE.

02:49.130 --> 02:51.621
WHERE ARE
THEY TAKING HER?

03:05.380 --> 03:08.076
Ruth on machine:
She's so small.
So tiny.

03:08.180 --> 03:12.014
Only 2 lbs. 4 oz.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.453
A very kind nurse
told me she's seen plenty
of premature births

03:15.560 --> 03:17.824
and she could usually
tell which ones...

03:20.230 --> 03:22.994
I don't know
if I could...

03:23.100 --> 03:25.068
( sobbing )
1--

03:25.170 --> 03:28.469
I CAN'T TAKE
ANOTHER CHILD DYING.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.342
Anyway,
I'm at Cedars-Sinai.

03:37.450 --> 03:40.010
BRENDA'S IN ROOM...

03:40.120 --> 03:41.815
913.

03:41.920 --> 03:45.845
Poor thing, her mother
won't be back until tomorrow.

03:45.950 --> 03:48.487
IT'S ONLY ME HERE.

03:48.590 --> 03:50.751
I'M SURE YOU'LL
WANT TO COME TOO.

03:50.860 --> 03:53.158
Okay, bye.

03:53.260 --> 03:55.649
( clicks )

03:57.700 --> 03:59.930
- ( answering machine beeps )
- Ted: I hope you're okay.

04:00.040 --> 04:04.465
And I hope you will
please call me and let me
know you are.

04:04.570 --> 04:06.401
I know you're mad
about me taking the keys,

04:06.510 --> 04:08.535
but don't be stupid,
Claire.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.870
Yeah,
the world is fucked up,

04:10.980 --> 04:14.143
but you ending up
in a wheelchair isn't going
to make it any better.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.172
You're too smart.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.679
You're too good.

04:18.790 --> 04:20.678
Don't waste that.

04:20.790 --> 04:22.724
( machine beeps )

04:24.530 --> 04:28.091
Okay, I just
turned into my father...

04:28.200 --> 04:31.863
like exactly.
That was my father.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.858
This is
what you do to me.

04:36.970 --> 04:38.608
Call me please.

04:41.810 --> 04:43.903
David:
WHEN YOU SAID GO AWAY,
I DIDN'T THINK YOU MEANT

04:44.010 --> 04:45.841
GO AWAY!
THIS IS BULLSHIT
AND YOU KNOW IT.

04:45.950 --> 04:48.942
SO THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN I REALLY NEED YOU.

04:49.050 --> 04:51.280
IT'S NICE TO KNOW
I CAN DEPEND ON YOU
IN A CRISIS.

04:51.390 --> 04:52.755
THIS IS FOR US.

04:52.860 --> 04:57.058
NO, THIS IS FOR YOU,
YOU ARROGANT MACHO FUCK!

04:57.160 --> 05:00.550
YOU THINK EVERYBODY'S
SUPPOSED TO BE SO FUCKING
STRONG ALL THE TIME!

05:00.660 --> 05:03.094
YOU CAN'T STAND
TO SEE ME WEAK LIKE THIS.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.191
YOU'RE REVOLTED BY ME.
"THIS IS FOR US."

05:05.300 --> 05:08.690
- FUCKING LIAR!
- I MEANT ALL FOUR OF US,
YOU FUCKIN' IDIOT!

05:08.800 --> 05:11.200
- YOU NEVER EVEN
WANTED THOSE KIDS...
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.

05:11.310 --> 05:14.473
...AND NOW YOU HONESTLY
THINK YOU CAN TAKE CARE
OF THEM ON YOUR OWN?

05:14.580 --> 05:16.229
YOU'RE NOT UP TO BEING
A SINGLE PARENT.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.306
WELL, YOU'RE NOT UP TO
BEING A PARENT AT ALL.

05:18.410 --> 05:20.742
YOU ARE USING THIS
AS AN EXCUSE TO DUMP ME,

05:20.850 --> 05:23.842
WHICH YOU'VE WANTED
TO DO EVER SINCE ANTHONY
AND DURRELL CAME HERE!

05:23.950 --> 05:25.815
DON'T TOUCH ME.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.184
COME HERE!

05:28.290 --> 05:31.088
- GOD!
- DAVID, I LOVE YOU.

05:31.190 --> 05:32.896
BUT I AM THOSE BOYS' FATHER,

05:33.000 --> 05:35.719
AND RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO
TAKE CARE OF THEM,
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T.

05:35.830 --> 05:40.335
YOU ARE SICK,
AND I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN GET WELL HERE.

05:46.240 --> 05:49.846
JESUS, WHEN AM I
GONNA FIND A FUCKING
MEDICATION THAT WORKS?

05:58.150 --> 05:59.788
( sobs )

05:59.890 --> 06:03.758
SHE HAS A PRETI'Y SEVERE
LACK OF SURFACT ANT
IN HER LUNGS,

06:03.860 --> 06:07.091
BUT SHE IS BREATHING STEADILY
WITH A VENTILATOR.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.328
I WANNA SEE HER.
WHY HASN'T SOMEBODY
BROUGHT HER IN?

06:10.430 --> 06:13.888
WELL, SHE'S IN AN INCUBATOR,
AND SHE'S HOOKED UP TO MONITORS,
A FEEDING TUBE.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.299
THEN WHY DOESN'T SOMEBODY
TAKE ME TO HER?

06:17.410 --> 06:19.207
SHE'S MY BABY.
YOU CAN'T KEEP HER FROM ME.

06:19.310 --> 06:22.131
WE'RE STILL LOOKING FOR SEPSIS,
POSSIBLE BLEEDS IN THE BRAIN.

06:22.240 --> 06:25.744
- OH GOD.
- MOST BABIES BORN
BEFORE 30 WEEKS

06:25.850 --> 06:29.479
EXPERIENCE CRANIAL BLEEDING
WITH VARYING DEGREES
OF SEVERITY.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.684
- WHEN CAN I SEE HER?
- AS SOON AS SHE'S READY.

06:32.790 --> 06:35.088
I PROMISE YOU SOMEONE
WILL COME TAKE YOU TO HER.

06:37.260 --> 06:38.921
OH GOD.

06:41.060 --> 06:42.664
DON'T YOU WORRY.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.625
WILLA IS GOING TO GET
THROUGH THIS AND BE HEALTHY,

06:45.730 --> 06:48.858
AND SHE'S GOING TO BE
HOME WITH YOU SOON.

06:54.840 --> 06:58.503
AND MAYA IS GONNA BE
HOME WITH YOU TOO.

07:09.190 --> 07:12.557
( rock music playing )

07:22.470 --> 07:26.065
I KNOW YOU DON'T
LIKE KIWI...

07:26.170 --> 07:30.573
BUT, REALLY,
I THINK YOU NEED TO GIVE IT
A SECOND CHANCE.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.315
( chuckles )
WHAT?

07:35.420 --> 07:38.742
WAS THAT PUSHY?

07:40.090 --> 07:41.785
_NO.
( glggles )

07:44.490 --> 07:48.119
NO, IT'S JUST
I'M EATING FRUIT SALAD

07:48.230 --> 07:51.859
IN BED WITH A NAKED FRAT BOY
WHO VOTED FOR GEORGE BUSH.

07:55.570 --> 07:59.131
WE'RE LISTENING
TO WHAT SOUNDS SUSPICIOUSLY
LIKE... CHRISTIAN MUSIC?

07:59.240 --> 08:01.333
IT IS CHRISTIAN MUSIC.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.374
WHAT?

08:03.480 --> 08:05.448
I JUST HEAR SONGS
ON THE RADIO

08:05.550 --> 08:07.370
AND IF I LIKE THEM,
I BUY THE CD.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.789
OH MY GOD,

08:09.890 --> 08:13.883
YOU MIGHT BE THE MOST
DEEPLY UN-HIP PERSON
I'VE EVER MET.

08:13.990 --> 08:18.757
AH, SEEING HOW
BEING HIP IS PRIMARILY
AN ADOLESCENT CONCERN,

08:18.860 --> 08:21.658
I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

08:21.760 --> 08:25.594
YOU KNOW, IF YOU
REALLY ARE CHRISTIAN...

08:25.700 --> 08:30.069
UM, I SHOULD PROBABLY
TELL YOU I HAD AN ABORTION.

08:35.110 --> 08:36.805
THAT'S OKAY...

08:38.280 --> 08:41.147
I SORT OF
PAID FOR ONE.

08:42.550 --> 08:45.587
WELL I... DIDN'T
REALLY PAY FOR IT.

08:45.690 --> 08:48.079
I STILL HAVE TO
SEND HER THE CHECK.

08:56.060 --> 08:59.291
GOD, I FEEL LIKE
I'M TRAPPED UNDERWATER.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.233
AND IT'S NOT JUST
NATE DYING.

09:02.340 --> 09:05.036
I MEAN, I HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA

09:05.140 --> 09:07.472
WHAT I AM SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH MY LIFE.

09:07.580 --> 09:10.640
DON'T YOU STILL
WANNA BE AN ARTIST?

09:13.620 --> 09:15.611
YEAH.

09:21.690 --> 09:24.250
BUT I'M SCARED THAT MAYBE
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.519
IS THAT TRUE?

09:27.630 --> 09:31.964
- MAYBE.
- SO GET BE'I'I'ER.

09:32.070 --> 09:33.697
UGH...

09:33.800 --> 09:36.598
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.407
I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH
IT'S ART,

09:39.510 --> 09:41.171
I STILL FEEL THAT
I'M JUST BEING PROGRAMMED.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.748
JUST TAKE PICTURES.
IF YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH,
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

09:43.850 --> 09:46.273
AND IF YOU'RE NOT,
YOU'LL GET GOOD ENOUGH.

09:47.350 --> 09:50.183
OR YOU'LL FIND OUT
YOU CAN'T.

09:56.990 --> 09:59.049
BUT I BET YOU ARE, THOUGH.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.227
MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE
PICTURES OF YOU NAKED.

10:06.330 --> 10:09.299
OKAY.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.561
OKAY.
( chuckles )

10:11.670 --> 10:15.606
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE
THAT YOU WON'T POST THEM
ON THE INTERNET.

10:15.710 --> 10:18.042
I MIGHT WANT TO RUN
FOR PUBLIC OFFICE SOME DAY.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.606
( giggles )

10:19.720 --> 10:21.915
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YEAH.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.817
AREN'T YOU?

10:25.990 --> 10:28.686
( rock music playing )

10:49.180 --> 10:52.718
( babies crying )

10:52.820 --> 10:55.971
Nate:
TOO BAD YOU DON'T
BELIEVE IN ANYTHING...

10:58.750 --> 11:00.854
OR YOU COULD PRAY.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.993
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS AFRAID O.

11:10.700 --> 11:13.066
FUCK!

11:24.180 --> 11:26.648
Come on, Charles.
You're our hero!

11:26.750 --> 11:28.718
- I'm no hero.
- Sure you are.

11:28.820 --> 11:32.688
You've gotta snap out of it.
You have to remember
the good times!

11:32.790 --> 11:35.987
- Like when?
- Like over there!

11:36.090 --> 11:37.887
UH, BOYS...

11:40.660 --> 11:43.265
I'M GONNA BE TAKING OFF
FOR A FEW DAYS.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.419
- WHY?
- WELL--

11:46.530 --> 11:48.361
'CAUSE Y'ALL ARE
SPLI'ITIN' UP,

11:48.470 --> 11:52.133
AND YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE US
WITH HIM-- THAT'S WHY.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.902
- LIKE WE DON'T KNOW.
- DURRELL.

11:55.010 --> 11:58.047
- I'M NOT LEAVING,
- YEAH, WELL, WHY YOU
HAVE A SUITCASE?

12:00.420 --> 12:03.480
( sighs )
LOOK...

12:05.820 --> 12:10.029
I HAVE TO GO AWAY
FOR NOW...

12:10.130 --> 12:14.920
BECAUSE THERE'S
A FUNERAL DIRECTORS'
CONFERENCE IN PORTLAND.

12:15.030 --> 12:17.669
DO YOU WANT ME TO BRING YOU
SOMETHING BACK?

12:17.770 --> 12:21.592
YEAH, BRING ME
A SILVER ESCALADE.

12:21.700 --> 12:25.568
DURRELL, I PROMISE YOU
I AM COMING BACK--

12:25.670 --> 12:28.070
I HEARD THAT BEFORE!

12:37.820 --> 12:39.879
( door closes )

12:39.990 --> 12:42.151
ARE YOU GONNA
BATHE YOURS?

12:44.290 --> 12:46.224
FUFFLE WITH IT.

12:48.330 --> 12:50.059
- TULIPS.
- PRETI'Y!

12:51.070 --> 12:52.662
YOU LEAVE YOUR DOOR
OPEN LIKE THAT?

12:52.770 --> 12:54.533
WE WERE JUST OUTSIDE
PICKING FLOWERS.

12:54.640 --> 12:58.064
RUTH, IT ISN'T
THE '505 ANYMORE,
NO MATTER HOW YOU DRESS.

13:01.810 --> 13:04.574
- SO YOU'RE READY TO GO,
YOU LITI'LI\IIEO|\l/ION KEY?

13:04.680 --> 13:07.217
- NO?!
- GO WHERE?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.470
WELL, BACK TO BRENDA'S
OF COURSE.

13:11.690 --> 13:13.715
BRENDA SAID YOU
AGREED TO THAT.

13:13.820 --> 13:17.586
WELL, YES, BUT I
THOUGHT BRENDA WAS STAYING IN
THE HOSPITAL A LITTLE LONGER.

13:17.690 --> 13:19.328
BRENDA'S NOT
THE ONE WHO'S SICK,

13:19.430 --> 13:21.295
AND ANYWAY, SHE CAN'T
REALLY VISIT THE BABY

13:21.400 --> 13:23.823
AFI'ER 10:00 P.M.,
SO SHE'S COMING HOME TONIGHT.

13:23.930 --> 13:27.036
AND THE BABY'S
STAYING IN THE HOSPITAL
AN EXTRA COUPLE OF WEEKS.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.392
OH.

13:38.050 --> 13:40.075
I SUPPOSE I'D BETTER
GO PACK HER THINGS THEN.

13:40.180 --> 13:42.478
THAT WOULD
BE HELPFUL, RUTH.

13:48.390 --> 13:53.089
SO HE SAYS THE HOUSE ALONE
IS WORTH $2 MILLION.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.624
SO 25%, I SHOULD BE ENTITLED
TO HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.

13:56.730 --> 14:00.131
- WHAT "SHOULD BE"? YOU ARE.
- ARE WE GONNA HAVE $1 MILLION?

14:00.240 --> 14:02.629
MM-HMM, SOMEDAY,
IF YOU EAT YOUR EGGS.

14:02.740 --> 14:06.107
YOU KNOW, I COULD
PUT HALF OF THAT DOWN
AS A DEPOSIT ON THE NEW PLACE,

14:06.210 --> 14:11.238
- SPEND 100 OR SO ON UPGRADES.
- THE REST WOULD TIDE US OVER
UNTIL WE GOT THINGS GOING.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.875
YEAH. YOU REALLY THINK
THIS COULD WORK?

14:13.980 --> 14:18.189
YOU KNOW WHAT, RICO?
I LIKED WHEN I HELPED YOU OUT
WITH THAT FUNERAL YESTERDAY.

14:18.290 --> 14:20.110
IT WAS SORT OF
LIKE BEING A NURSE,

14:20.220 --> 14:22.757
BUT WITHOUT ALL THE BLOOD
AND BEDPANS AND PILLS...

14:22.860 --> 14:24.521
AND I GOT TO WEAR
BETTER CLOTHES.

14:25.460 --> 14:26.825
JULIO,
PLEASE, EGGS.

14:26.930 --> 14:28.522
AUGUSTO THINKS
THEY'RE GROSS.

14:28.630 --> 14:30.495
WELL... THEY ARE
KIND OF GROSS,

14:30.600 --> 14:32.022
BUT EAT 'EM
ANYWAY.

14:32.130 --> 14:34.769
ALL YOU GOTTA DO NOW
IS GET THE FISHERS
TO BUY YOU OUT.

14:34.870 --> 14:36.531
OR SELL...

14:36.640 --> 14:39.234
PREFERABLY
TO SOMEONE WHO JUST
WANTS THE HOUSE AND THE LAND

14:39.340 --> 14:41.171
AND WANTS TO SHUT
THE BUSINESS DOWN.

14:42.440 --> 14:43.839
WHAT?

14:43.950 --> 14:45.474
NATE LEFT HIS PART
TO BRENDA.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.719
I DON'T THINK
SHE WANTS TO BE
IN THE FUNERAL BUSINESS.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.310
I THINK DAVID'S
GOING KIND OF NUTS.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.547
HE NEEDS TO GET OUT.

14:51.650 --> 14:55.518
PLUS, WHO NEEDS
THE COMPETITION ANWVAY,
YOU KNOW?

14:57.160 --> 15:00.049
( phone ringing )

15:08.800 --> 15:11.064
- HELLO? _
- George: HI.

15:11.170 --> 15:13.809
I JUST THOUGHT I'D
CHECK IN WITH YOU.

15:13.910 --> 15:15.901
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

15:16.010 --> 15:18.274
Any news about Willa?

15:18.380 --> 15:20.211
NO, AND I'M FINE.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.016
DOESN'T SOUND
VERY CONVINCING.

15:23.120 --> 15:26.339
WELL, I'M SORRY, GEORGE,
BUT I HAVE ENOUGH
TO WORRY ABOUT

15:26.450 --> 15:29.510
WITHOUT HAVING
TO CONVINCE YOU
HOW I'M FEELING.

15:29.620 --> 15:33.795
- ANOTHER BAD DAY?
- Yes, it's a terrible day.

15:33.900 --> 15:36.926
BRENDA'S MOTHER CAME
AND TOOK MAYA.

15:39.130 --> 15:42.190
NOW I'M ALONE.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.905
I'M FINALLY
COMPLETELY ALONE.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.137
OH, HONEY.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.935
You're not alone.
You have me.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.577
GEORGE, I HAVE TO GO.
DAVID'S HERE.

15:56.150 --> 15:58.687
I CAN'T BE AT HOME
RIGHT NOW.

16:00.090 --> 16:02.354
WHERE WILL YOU GO?

16:03.730 --> 16:05.322
HERE.

16:05.430 --> 16:07.352
OH...

16:09.060 --> 16:11.164
GO PUT YOUR THINGS
UPSTAIRS THEN.

16:11.270 --> 16:12.965
I'LL MAKE YOU
SOME CEREAL.

16:17.940 --> 16:19.703
WOULD YOU LIKE IT
IN YOUR YELLOW BOWL?

16:19.810 --> 16:22.779
MOM, I DON'T THINK
I'VE EATEN OUT OF
THAT YELLOW BOWL

16:22.880 --> 16:24.643
SINCE I WAS
A LITTLE BOY.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.015
YEAH, PUT IT
IN THE YELLOW BOWL.

16:39.090 --> 16:41.695
Man on machine:
Yeah, uh, I'm looking
for Claire Fisher.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.859
- ( door closes )
- This is Dennis
at New Image

16:43.970 --> 16:46.962
- and I'm just calling
to find out where I should--
- HELLO.

16:47.070 --> 16:49.834
- Hi, Claire Fisher?
- YEAH?

16:49.940 --> 16:53.330
I need an address to send
your application package to.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.109
ARE YOU FROM
THE TEMP AGENCY?

16:57.210 --> 16:59.542
No, I'm from New Image.

16:59.650 --> 17:02.676
We're a stock
photo production house
in New York City.

17:02.780 --> 17:05.010
UM...

17:05.120 --> 17:07.088
WHAT KIND OF APPLICATION?

17:07.190 --> 17:08.782
Photographer's assistant.

17:08.890 --> 17:10.858
_I_t's like _ _
a traInIng pOSItIon.

17:10.960 --> 17:14.623
About a quarter of
our staff photographers
started out as assistants.

17:15.700 --> 17:16.849
REALLY?

17:16.960 --> 17:20.862
Uh, really.

17:20.970 --> 17:23.768
ALL I COULD THINK OF IS
MAYBE THE GALLERY OWNER
FROM MY SHOW

17:23.870 --> 17:27.704
IS THE ONE WHO SUGGESTED ME.
OR MAYBE IT WAS BILLY.
YEAH, HE WOULD DO THAT,

17:27.810 --> 17:31.871
PARTLY JUST TO MAKE ME
FEEL GUILTY FOR DUMPING HIM.
FUCK THAT.

17:31.980 --> 17:33.845
AND THE PAY IS SHIT,
I'M SURE.

17:33.950 --> 17:36.544
BUT IT IS A JOB--
NEW YORK CITY!

17:36.650 --> 17:40.040
I ACTUALLY COULD
MOVE UP TO BECOME
A STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER,

17:40.160 --> 17:43.948
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT
GONNA GET MY HOPES UP
LIKE I DID ABOUT THAT GRANT.

17:44.060 --> 17:45.948
IT'S WONDERFUL TO HEAR.

17:46.060 --> 17:48.551
YOU COULDN'T PAY ME
TO LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY.

17:52.330 --> 17:54.560
WOULD YOU LIKE
A BOWL OF CEREAL?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.763
UM, NO THANKS.

18:00.710 --> 18:05.374
Woman:
I'M NOT SURE WHO DESIGNED
THE STAINED-GLASS WINDOW.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.539
I HEARD IT WAS A SOMEWHAT
INFLUENTIAL ARTIST.

18:07.650 --> 18:10.448
UH, WHAT ABOUT
THE WATER PROBLEMS
IN THE BASEMENT?

18:10.550 --> 18:13.485
OH, BIG REPAIR JOB
LESS THAN A YEAR AGO.

18:13.590 --> 18:17.424
THEY COMPLETELY REDID
THE PLUMBING AS WELL AS
ALL THE UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.851
- Vanessa:
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
- WOW!

18:19.960 --> 18:23.327
YES, APPARENTLY,
THERE WAS SOME SORT
OF A-- A PROBLEM.

18:23.430 --> 18:25.227
EH, WHEN EVERYTHING
GETS BACKED UP,

18:25.330 --> 18:26.991
THEN BLOOD COMES
OUT OF THE TOILET.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.501
YEAH, THAT HAPPENS.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.931
CAN WE GET A COPY
OF THE WORK REPORT
AND THE GUARANTEE?

18:33.040 --> 18:34.735
- YES.
- GREAT.

18:34.840 --> 18:38.571
I WILL HAVE THE SELLER
FAX THAT OVER TO YOU.

18:38.680 --> 18:41.649
WE COULD PUT AN ESPRESSO BAR
IN THIS NOOK.

18:43.220 --> 18:44.744
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS
WANTED TO DO THAT,

18:44.850 --> 18:47.580
BUT DAVID THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE DISRESPECTFUL.

18:48.220 --> 18:50.984
( sighs )

18:51.090 --> 18:52.853
GREAT.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.252
VERY NICE.

18:57.730 --> 19:00.062
I CAN'T SAY SHE'S
OUT OF THE WOODS FOR SURE.

19:00.170 --> 19:02.491
YOU'LL HAVE TO WATCH
AND SEE HOW SHE DEVELOPS

19:02.600 --> 19:05.330
TO KNOW IF THERE'S
ANY PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.931
BUT, FROM
A PHYSICAL STANDPOINT,

19:08.040 --> 19:10.008
SHE IS DOING
REMARKABLY WELL.

19:10.110 --> 19:12.078
THANK GOD.

19:12.180 --> 19:15.809
SHE'S BEEN TAKING
YOUR MILK FROM THE BOTTLE
ALL THE TIME NOW, RIGHT?

19:15.920 --> 19:17.581
- RIGHT.
- THEN I THINK WE CAN

19:17.690 --> 19:19.442
PERMANENTLY REMOVE
THAT FEEDING TUBE.

19:19.550 --> 19:21.381
WHEN CAN I
TAKE HER HOME?

19:21.490 --> 19:23.526
WELL, I'D LIKE TO KEEP HER
ANOTHER 24 HOURS

19:23.630 --> 19:25.882
AFTER THE TUBE COMES OUT
JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE.

19:25.990 --> 19:30.859
SO THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
NO SIGN OF SPINA BIFIDA
OR DOWN'S?

19:30.970 --> 19:33.438
- DEFINITELY NEITHER OF THOSE.
- AND YOU CHECKED FOR

19:33.540 --> 19:36.236
EVERY POSSIBLE PROBLEM
THAT THE TRIPLE MARKER
COULD HAVE FOUND?

19:36.340 --> 19:37.898
AND I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING--

19:38.010 --> 19:40.001
NOTHING THAT
WOULD BE APPARENT
AT THIS POINT ANYWAY.

19:40.110 --> 19:42.977
GREAT. SO SHE'LL SEEM
NORMAL FOR A WHILE

19:43.080 --> 19:45.571
BEFORE WHATEVER'S
FUCKED UP ABOUT HER
SHOWS UP.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.911
WELL, THAT'S POSITIVE NEWS,
ISN'T IT, SWEETHEART?

19:49.020 --> 19:51.181
SHUT UP, MARGE,
YOU FUCKIN' IDIOT.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.848
THE FACT SHE
WAS PREMATURE

19:52.950 --> 19:56.681
HAS SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THAT BLOOD TEST
AND YOU KNOW IT.

19:56.790 --> 19:59.258
THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH OUR BABY.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.328
YOU SHOULD NEVER
HAVE HAD HER.

20:01.430 --> 20:04.490
- OH GOD.
- FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, BRENDA,

20:04.600 --> 20:06.420
THERE'S SOMETHING
TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT.

20:06.530 --> 20:08.566
DON'T SHIT
ALL OVER IT!

20:11.970 --> 20:13.904
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.314
- I got him--
- Aha!

20:20.420 --> 20:22.741
Don't ever do that!

20:22.850 --> 20:25.489
- What? Do what?
- Pop up like that.

20:25.590 --> 20:28.150
- Like this?
- Don't!

20:28.260 --> 20:31.582
- ( audience laughing )
- RUTH?

20:35.500 --> 20:37.127
THE BACK DOOR IS OPEN.

20:37.230 --> 20:41.132
YES, I SUPPOSE SOMEONE
COULD JUST COME IN AND
MURDER ME IN COLD BLOOD,

20:41.240 --> 20:44.505
- WHICH WOULD BE
A BLESSING.
- RUTHIE...

20:45.840 --> 20:47.899
IT JUST TAKES TIME.

20:48.010 --> 20:50.501
LIAR.

20:50.610 --> 20:53.374
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY
ALWAYS SAYS AND IT'S A LIE.

20:54.580 --> 20:57.219
EACH DAY I FEEL WORSE,

20:57.320 --> 21:00.756
MORE EMPTY,
MORE DEAD.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.886
I BARELY EVEN REMEMBER
MY LIFE BEFORE NATE.

21:03.990 --> 21:07.699
I WAS PRACTICALLY A CHILD
WHEN I HAD HIM.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.419
HOW CAN I LIVE
WITHOUT HIM? I CAN'T.

21:11.530 --> 21:14.658
YES, YOU CAN...
FOR MAYA.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.504
THEY'VE TAKEN MAYA.

21:21.940 --> 21:25.444
I WILL PROBABLY NEVER SEE HER
OR HER SISTER AGAIN...

21:25.550 --> 21:28.849
IF HER SISTER
EVEN SURVIVES.

21:28.950 --> 21:32.147
RUTH...

21:32.250 --> 21:34.684
I PROMISE YOU,
YOU WILL GET THROUGH THIS.

21:34.790 --> 21:37.054
I DON'T WANNA
GET THROUGH IT!

21:39.930 --> 21:44.594
THIS IS THE WORST THING
THAT CAN EVER HAPPEN
TO ANYONE.

21:46.270 --> 21:48.898
THIS IS HELL, GEORGE,
HELL,

21:49.000 --> 21:51.139
AND I JUST WANT IT
TO END.

21:51.240 --> 21:54.698
THEN LET ME
TAKE CARE OF YOU.

21:54.810 --> 21:57.847
LET ME MAKE SURE YOU DON'T
GO THROUGH THIS ALONE.

21:59.780 --> 22:01.941
YOU DID IT FOR ME.

22:02.050 --> 22:03.881
NOW IT'S MY TURN.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.548
TO DO WHAT?

22:05.650 --> 22:09.313
FEEL HELPLESS WHILE YOU
WATCH ME LOSE MY MIND?

22:13.230 --> 22:16.722
JUST... LET ME HOLD YOU.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.375
David:
ABSOLUTELY NOT!

22:30.480 --> 22:33.074
THIS IS MY FAMILY'S BUSINESS
AND I WON'T SELL IT.

22:33.180 --> 22:36.513
SO... BUY ME OUT.

22:36.620 --> 22:37.985
FINE!

22:38.090 --> 22:40.115
BUT I HOPE THAT YOU'RE
AWARE THAT THIS PLACE

22:40.220 --> 22:42.017
IS PROBABLY WORTH
$2 MILLION.

22:42.120 --> 22:43.883
I HAD IT APPRAISED.

22:43.990 --> 22:46.550
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
WITH YOUR PART, BRENDA?

22:46.660 --> 22:49.823
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.967
SORRY, DAVID,
I DON'T.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.963
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T REALLY CARE EITHER.

23:01.810 --> 23:05.598
WHY AM I FIGHTING
FOR SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN AMBIVALENT ABOUT?

23:05.710 --> 23:08.270
HABIT.

23:08.380 --> 23:12.885
SO... WE PUT IT
ON THE MARKET?

23:17.220 --> 23:19.120
SURE. WHY NOT?

23:21.360 --> 23:23.863
COOL.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.460
( beeps )

23:25.570 --> 23:27.390
I MEAN, IF WE CAN MAKE
THAT KIND OF MONEY,

23:27.500 --> 23:29.161
WHY HANG ON TO IT?

23:29.270 --> 23:30.806
I HAVE NO REASON.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.231
WE'VE BEEN CLUTCHING
SO DESPERATELY TO THE PAST

23:33.340 --> 23:35.069
AND FOR WHAT?

23:35.180 --> 23:37.603
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHEN THERE WAS HOPE.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.312
( gasps )

23:49.420 --> 23:52.025
(crying )

23:53.530 --> 23:55.725
UM, I'M GOING OVER
TO TED'S TONIGHT.

23:55.830 --> 23:59.266
TAKE A SWEATER!
OH... DAMN!

23:59.370 --> 24:03.033
- WHAT IS SHE DOING?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

24:05.270 --> 24:06.908
( sobbing )

24:07.010 --> 24:09.433
MOM?

24:12.880 --> 24:15.474
MAYA'S MONKEY!

24:16.450 --> 24:18.145
SHE LOVES
THIS MONKEY!

24:25.560 --> 24:27.755
I HAVE TO WASH IT.

24:38.610 --> 24:40.669
Keith:
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.237
I MEAN, THINK OF
WHAT WE CAN DO WITH
YOUR PORTION AND MY SAVINGS.

24:43.340 --> 24:44.773
WE COULD FINALLY
BUY A HOUSE.

24:44.880 --> 24:46.575
WE COULD BUY
A HOUSE NOW.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.875
BUT WE COULD BUY A HOUSE
AND YOU COULD GO BACK TO SCHOOL

24:48.980 --> 24:51.710
AND BECOME A LAWYER
LIKE YOU'VE ALWAYS DREAMED.

24:51.820 --> 24:54.288
I DON'T THINK I EVER
REALLY EVEN WANTED
TO BE A LAWYER.

24:54.390 --> 24:57.928
I THINK I JUST WANTED
TO HAVE SEX WITH
HARRY HAMLIN.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.726
I'M SERIOUS.
YOU CAN BE WHATEVER
YOU WANNA BE, DAVID.

25:00.830 --> 25:03.799
- SO CAN YOU.
- EXACTLY.

25:03.900 --> 25:06.698
WE COULD REALLY BUY
A HOUSE, COULDN'T WE,
WITH A YARD?

25:06.800 --> 25:09.394
WE COULD GET THE BOYS
A DOG AND A TIRE SWING.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.866
THOSE BOYS DON'T WANT
A TIRE SWING,

25:11.970 --> 25:13.972
THEY WANT A TV
THE SIZE OF A WALL.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.674
( chuckles )

25:16.780 --> 25:19.476
SO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE READY
TO COME BACK HOME SOON?

25:19.580 --> 25:23.584
- BECAUSE I DO.
- MAYBE.

25:24.450 --> 25:26.543
GOOD.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.024
( ominous music
Playing )

25:39.130 --> 25:41.837
( music stops )

25:41.940 --> 25:43.828
( sighs )

25:45.570 --> 25:48.698
Anthony:
MAN, THOSE ARE BIG TEETH.

25:50.410 --> 25:53.470
WHOA, LOOK AT
THE WOLF BRAIN
MADE INTO ASPHALT!

25:53.580 --> 25:58.085
- WOW!
- BUT IT LOOKS
LIKE POOP!

25:58.190 --> 26:00.488
( chuckles )
COOL.

26:00.590 --> 26:03.081
NO, IT'S NOT COOL.

26:03.190 --> 26:06.751
AND YOU SAYING IT IS
JUST MAKES IT EVEN
MORE NOT COOL.

26:13.070 --> 26:15.163
I THINK IT'S COOL.

26:15.270 --> 26:17.192
THANK YOU,
ANTHONY.

26:19.540 --> 26:22.202
( Olivier singing
in French )

26:33.990 --> 26:36.914
( cooing )

26:38.530 --> 26:40.521
( laughing )

26:40.630 --> 26:43.997
I'VE NEVER NEVER
SEEN YOU ACT THIS WAY!

26:44.100 --> 26:47.092
- SO?
- YEAH, SO IT HAS TO
BE ANALYZED

26:47.200 --> 26:50.397
AND DIAGNOSED AND
TURNED INTO AN EXAMPLE
OF SOME KIND OF PATHOLOGY.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.400
I MEAN, THIS IS
THE CHENOWITH FAMILY.

26:52.510 --> 26:55.331
OH GOD, BILLY!
HAVE A DRINK!

26:58.580 --> 27:01.413
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE
BORN INTO. I'M SORRY.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.341
- AREN'T THEY FUNNY?
- ( chuckles )

27:04.450 --> 27:07.214
( laughing )

27:07.320 --> 27:09.959
OH, DEAR,
SHE'S HAVING GUESTS.

27:10.060 --> 27:13.052
MOM, SHE KNOWS
WE'RE COMING.

27:13.160 --> 27:16.652
- I CALLED HER.
- I CAN'T GO IN.
I'LL WAIT IN THE CAR.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.990
MRS. FISHER,

27:19.100 --> 27:23.332
I THINK MAYA WOULD BE
VERY HAPPY TO SEE
HER MONKEY.

27:24.470 --> 27:26.404
AND TO SEE YOU.

27:43.220 --> 27:43.288
- OH, HI.
- HEY!

27:46.060 --> 27:48.654
COME ON IN.
EVERYONE'S IN THE KITCHEN.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.967
- MRS. FISHER.
- HI.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.719
HI. TED.

27:52.830 --> 27:55.139
THIS IS BILLY,
BRENDA'S BROTHER.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.607
- OH, BILLY.
- TED.

27:58.710 --> 28:01.406
I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

28:02.840 --> 28:05.047
YEAH, NICE TO MEET
YOU TOO!

28:09.480 --> 28:11.539
Ruth:
WHAT-WHAT IS THAT?

28:11.650 --> 28:14.414
DO YOU--
CAN YOU TELL ME?

28:14.520 --> 28:15.851
CAN YOU TELL ME?

28:15.960 --> 28:18.258
DOES THE MONKEY KNOW?

28:18.360 --> 28:21.022
YOU'RE SO PENSIVE,
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

28:21.130 --> 28:24.918
OH, JUST HOW MUCH IT SUCKS
THAT WE HAVE TO GET OLD.

28:25.030 --> 28:27.760
OH CLAIRE, PLEASE,
DON'T GET MAUDLIN ON ME.

28:30.870 --> 28:34.203
SO BRENDA TELLS ME
YOU'RE PLANNING ON
MOVING TO NEW YORK?

28:34.310 --> 28:36.733
UH, MAYBE.

28:38.410 --> 28:40.970
I'VE APPLIED FOR THIS,
LIKE, ENTRY-LEVEL POSITION

28:41.080 --> 28:44.481
- AT THIS, LIKE,
STOCK PHOTO HOUSE...
- HMM.

28:44.590 --> 28:46.387
...NEW IMAGE.

28:46.490 --> 28:48.879
- IMPRESSIVE.
- NOT REALLY.

28:48.990 --> 28:51.823
IT'S JUST A LAME GOFER JOB
LIKE I USED TO DO FOR YOU.

28:51.930 --> 28:54.023
NO, IT ISN'T.

28:54.130 --> 28:58.226
YOU COULD EASILY
GO ON TO BECOME A SOULLESS
ADVERTISING PHOTOGRAPHER.

28:58.330 --> 29:01.891
AND WITH YOUR GIFTS, HMM,
I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY WILL.

29:06.340 --> 29:08.706
AND I'M THE ONE
WHO RECOMMENDED YOU.

29:08.810 --> 29:10.869
SHUT THE FUCK UP.

29:10.980 --> 29:13.574
CLAIRE, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO FUCKED RUSSELL.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.114
I STILL BELIEVE
IN YOU.

29:16.220 --> 29:18.688
JESUS, OLIVIER,

29:18.790 --> 29:20.917
THAT'S SO NICE OF YOU.

29:22.820 --> 29:24.924
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

29:25.030 --> 29:27.658
CALM DOWN. I MEAN,
YOU JUST POPPED
INTO MY MIND

29:27.760 --> 29:30.194
BECAUSE I'D JUST SEEN YOU
AT THAT JUNIOR SHOW.

29:34.740 --> 29:36.093
MAYA,

29:36.200 --> 29:39.863
DON'T YOU WANT TO SHOW
GRANDMA YOUR OKAPI?

29:39.970 --> 29:42.939
- OKAPI!
- YES!

29:43.040 --> 29:45.179
I DON'T BELIEVE
I'VE EVER HEARD
OF AN OKAPI.

29:45.280 --> 29:48.374
OH, THE OKAPI IS
THE ONLY KNOWN LIVING
RELATIVE OF THE GIRAFFE.

29:48.480 --> 29:51.540
ITS YOUNG REALLY DON'T SEEM
TO IMPRINT ON THE MOTHERS,

29:51.650 --> 29:54.289
SO THEY NURSE
FROM MANY AVAILABLE
LACTATING FEMALES.

29:54.390 --> 29:57.018
WE JUST WENT
TO THE ZOO THIS WEEK.

29:58.090 --> 30:00.786
( singing lullaby)

30:04.870 --> 30:07.225
SO, UH...

30:08.340 --> 30:09.762
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
AND CLAIRE BEEN...

30:09.870 --> 30:12.805
- TOGETHER?
- UH...

30:12.910 --> 30:15.071
WELL, WE MET--

30:15.180 --> 30:18.308
I GUESS IT WAS ABOUT
FOUR MONTHS AGO.

30:18.410 --> 30:21.174
- HUH!
- WELL, WE--

30:21.280 --> 30:23.510
WE REALLY DIDN'T
HIT IT OFF THAT GREAT
AT FIRST.

30:23.620 --> 30:25.178
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

30:25.290 --> 30:28.088
I WAS THERE WHEN
SHE GOT THE CALL
ABOUT NATE

30:28.190 --> 30:29.509
AND I SPENT MOST
OF THAT NIGHT

30:29.620 --> 30:31.087
IN THE HOSPITAL
WITH HER.

30:31.190 --> 30:32.851
HUH.

30:33.960 --> 30:36.053
THAT'S HOW MY SISTER
MET HER BROTHER.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.219
THE NIGHT
HIS FATHER DIED.

30:39.130 --> 30:41.598
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

30:43.100 --> 30:47.036
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
IT LIKE RUNS IN THE FAMILY?

30:51.250 --> 30:53.468
IAM SO...

30:53.580 --> 30:56.413
JEALOUS OF YOU.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.178
EXCUSE ME A SECOND.

31:14.070 --> 31:15.867
SHE LOOKS MUCH STRONGER.

31:15.970 --> 31:18.165
Brenda:
OH, SHE IS.
SHE'S MUCH STRONGER.

31:18.270 --> 31:20.465
Nate:
NO, SHE'S NOT.
SHE'S BARELY MOVING.

31:22.110 --> 31:24.044
SHE'S A VERY CALM BABY.

31:24.150 --> 31:26.106
I THINK SHE'S BLIND.

31:26.210 --> 31:28.041
SHE GETS STRONGER
EVERY DAY.

31:28.150 --> 31:30.675
OH, SHE'S FIERCE
WHEN SHE NURSES.

31:30.780 --> 31:32.941
I'M COVERED IN BRUISES.

31:33.050 --> 31:34.779
NATE HAD
A BIG APPETITE.

31:34.890 --> 31:36.812
IS SHE GASSY?

31:36.920 --> 31:39.718
NO, NOT OVERLY SO,

31:39.830 --> 31:41.991
BUT SHE'S ALWAYS HUNGRY.

31:42.100 --> 31:44.318
THAT'S BECAUSE
SHE KNOWS SHE DOESN'T
HAVE MUCH TIME.

31:44.430 --> 31:46.898
SHE WANTS TO GET IT
WHILE SHE CAN.

31:54.710 --> 31:56.905
( floor creaking )

32:04.250 --> 32:05.786
( sighs )

32:05.890 --> 32:08.313
SO YOU'RE REALLY
GOING TO SELL YOUR LEGACY?

32:08.420 --> 32:11.526
- YOUR BIRTHRIGHT?
- YEAH, AND GOOD RIDDANCE.

32:11.630 --> 32:14.258
WELL, I CAN'T
SAY I'M SURPRISED.
YOU NEVER HAD IT IN YOU.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.521
NEITHER DID YOU.
THE ONLY WAY YOU
COULD HANDLE IT

32:16.630 --> 32:19.667
WAS TO HAVE A SECRET ROOM
OVER A REALLY BAD
INDIAN RESTAURANT.

32:19.770 --> 32:22.568
OH, AND YOU DON'T THINK
YOU HAVE A SECRET ROOM?

32:22.670 --> 32:26.606
WHAT DO YOU THINK BEING
GAY IS, YOU FUCKING FREAK?

32:28.610 --> 32:30.532
FUCK YOU.

32:31.780 --> 32:33.372
WHAT DID YOU
JUST SAY TO ME?

32:33.480 --> 32:35.641
LEAVE ME ALONE, DAD.

32:35.750 --> 32:38.446
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE?

32:42.420 --> 32:45.651
YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST
WALK AWAY FROM THIS?

32:47.290 --> 32:49.451
ARE YOU REALLY
THAT STUPID?

32:51.230 --> 32:54.996
- IT ONLY GETS CLOSER, DAVID.
- SHUT UP.

32:57.840 --> 32:59.262
( growling )

33:01.080 --> 33:02.968
YOU DON'T EXIST.

33:59.570 --> 34:03.165
( Yelps )
The window washer's
been right outside

34:03.270 --> 34:06.034
this whole time watching me
change my stockings.

34:06.140 --> 34:08.779
( giggling )
YES, I WILL CALL YOU LATER.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.178
OKAY, BYE.

34:12.710 --> 34:15.372
Woman on TV:
Actually, he's pretty cute.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.414
Dark hair
and good build.

34:17.520 --> 34:20.387
- Claire:
WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?
- Hello, Mr. Clean.

34:20.490 --> 34:24.756
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S ALWAYS ON.
- I've been a very dirty girl.

34:24.860 --> 34:28.227
( audience laughing )

34:28.330 --> 34:32.198
ISN'T IT WEIRD
THIS ISN'T GONNA BE
OUR HOUSE ANYMORE?

34:37.200 --> 34:39.964
I GUESS I'LL MOVE IN
WITH TED,

34:40.070 --> 34:42.573
ALTHOUGH I REALLY HATE
HIS APARTMENT.

34:44.150 --> 34:45.777
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

34:45.880 --> 34:48.371
I SUPPOSE I'LL MOVE IN
WITH GEORGE.

34:48.480 --> 34:51.688
- YEAH?
- HE'S OFFERED.

34:53.190 --> 34:55.078
WELL, IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?

34:57.490 --> 34:59.924
I'LL NEVER HAVE
WHAT I WANT, NEVER.

35:00.030 --> 35:02.521
( phone ringing )

35:07.170 --> 35:09.536
- HELLO?
- Man: Is this Claire?

35:09.640 --> 35:12.859
- YEAH.
- This is Scott in
accounting at New Image.

35:12.970 --> 35:16.337
I need you to send me
your social and address
in New York.

35:16.440 --> 35:19.102
UM... I DON'T HAVE
AN ADDRESS IN NEW YORK.

35:19.210 --> 35:20.802
I LIVE IN CALIFORNIA.

35:20.910 --> 35:25.210
Hmm. That's gonna be
an awfully big commute.

35:26.220 --> 35:27.847
DOES THAT MEAN
I HAVE THE JOB?

35:27.950 --> 35:31.226
Uh, I have you down
as starting work
on December 7th.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.685
YOU DO?
OH MY GOD, MOM!

35:38.030 --> 35:39.463
Hello?

35:39.570 --> 35:42.459
I CAN GIVE YOU
MY SOCIAL NOW.

35:42.570 --> 35:45.403
CAN I GIVE YOU MY
IN NEW YORK ADDRESS
A LITTLE BIT LATER...

35:45.510 --> 35:47.432
LIKE WHEN I ACTUALLY
HAVE ONE?

35:47.540 --> 35:49.405
Sure.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.513
( footsteps approaching )

35:59.820 --> 36:01.856
I CALLED OFF ESCROW.

36:03.220 --> 36:04.824
YOU DID WHAT?

36:04.930 --> 36:08.195
THIS IS MY FAMILY'S BUSINESS,
RICO, AND I WON'T SELL IT.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.359
I'M SORRY.

36:12.400 --> 36:15.062
WELL THEN,
YOU HAVE TO
BUY ME OUT.

36:15.170 --> 36:17.593
I DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF MONEY.

36:18.940 --> 36:20.532
( chuckling )

36:23.310 --> 36:25.141
SO, WHAT?
I'M JUST FUCKED?

36:25.250 --> 36:28.447
MAYBE YOU CAN FIND SOMEONE
TO BUY YOUR SHARE OUT.

36:28.550 --> 36:30.472
NOBODY'S GONNA WANNA PAY
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

36:30.580 --> 36:32.480
FOR 25% OF THIS BUSINESS,
YOU FUCKIN' MORON!

36:32.590 --> 36:34.285
IF THEY HAVE
THAT KIND OF MONEY,

36:34.390 --> 36:36.449
THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO
OPEN UP THEIR OWN PLACE.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.926
SOMETHING SMALLER.
SOMETHING THEY CAN
FINALLY CALL THEIR OWN

36:39.030 --> 36:41.396
AND RUN THE WAY
THEY WANT WITHOUT
A BUNCH OF IDIOTS

36:41.500 --> 36:43.058
ALWAYS GETTING
IN THEIR FUCKING WAY!

36:43.160 --> 36:45.219
( clangs )

36:51.440 --> 36:54.273
Ruth:
OH, JUST THROW IT OUT.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.507
REALLY? I ALWAYS
LIKED THIS ON YOU.

36:56.610 --> 36:58.407
IT ITCH ES.

36:59.780 --> 37:03.739
MY ENTIRE LIFE I'VE BEEN
WEARING CLOTHES THAT I HATE.

37:07.020 --> 37:10.478
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK YOU,
HOW IS MAGGIE DOING?

37:11.360 --> 37:13.487
I HAVE NO IDEA.

37:13.590 --> 37:15.797
MAGGIE LEFT
OVER A MONTH AGO.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.619
LEFT?
WHERE DID SHE GO?

37:18.730 --> 37:20.459
I DON'T KNOW.

37:20.570 --> 37:23.368
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE YOUR OWN DAUGHTER IS?

37:23.470 --> 37:25.961
RUTH, PLEASE,
DON'T SENSATIONALIZE IT.

37:26.070 --> 37:29.631
GEORGE, DON'T TALK TO ME
LIKE YOU'RE MY FATHER
OR MY TEACHER.

37:29.740 --> 37:32.641
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH I HATE IT
WHEN YOU DO THAT?

37:34.880 --> 37:36.643
I SAW MAGGIE...

37:36.750 --> 37:39.218
JUST BEFORE BRENDA
GAVE BIRTH.

37:39.320 --> 37:42.209
AND SHE WAS COMPLETELY
IRRATIONAL.

37:42.320 --> 37:45.756
SHE WAS VERY VERY ANGRY.

37:45.860 --> 37:47.623
WITH YOU?

37:47.730 --> 37:50.358
NO, I THINK SHE WAS ANGRY
WITH THE STATE OF HER LIFE.

37:50.460 --> 37:52.018
SHE JUST CHOSE
TO TAKE IT OUT ON ME.

37:52.130 --> 37:54.269
WHAT STATE OF HER LIFE?

37:54.370 --> 37:57.692
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE DIDN'T TELL ME.

37:57.800 --> 38:00.268
- YOU DIDN'T ASK?
- NO, I DIDN'T.

38:01.940 --> 38:04.443
SHE TOLD ME
SHE WOULD CALL ME
WHEN SHE GOT SETTLED.

38:04.550 --> 38:08.441
LOOK, THIS IS NOT
THE FIRST TIME
IT'S HAPPENED.

38:12.520 --> 38:15.580
I DON'T THINK I CAN
MOVE IN WITH YOU, GEORGE.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.125
WHY NOT?

38:20.230 --> 38:23.688
BECAUSE--
DON'T GET ME WRONG,

38:23.800 --> 38:26.496
YOU'RE A GOOD, DECENT MAN
WITH A BIG HEART.

38:26.600 --> 38:29.467
BUT THERE ARE WALLS
AROUND THAT HEART--

38:29.570 --> 38:32.630
WALLS BEHIND WALLS
BEHIND WALLS.

38:32.740 --> 38:36.574
AND I CAN SPEND A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF TIME AROUND THAT,

38:36.680 --> 38:39.046
BUT I CANNOT LIVE WITH IT,
NOT ANYMORE.

38:44.450 --> 38:46.589
OH, DON'T LOOK SO SOUR.

38:46.690 --> 38:50.581
IT DOESN'T MEAN
I WON'T GO OUT WITH YOU.

38:50.690 --> 38:52.749
WE CAN HAVE A LOT
MORE FUN THIS WAY.

38:53.830 --> 38:55.991
BELIEVE ME...

38:57.400 --> 38:59.766
I COULD USE
A LITTLE FUN.

39:01.600 --> 39:04.296
FATHER, WE THANK THEE
FOR THESE AND ALL
THY BLESSINGS.

39:04.410 --> 39:05.934
All: AMEN.

39:06.040 --> 39:08.702
NOT SO FAST.

39:10.510 --> 39:12.842
WE THANK THEE FOR THE GIFT
OF THIS FOOD...

39:14.380 --> 39:17.508
AND PLEASE THANK THE ANIMALS
WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES
SO WE COULD EAT,

39:17.620 --> 39:21.283
FOR THE LOVE WE FEEL
FOR EACH OTHER,

39:21.390 --> 39:23.085
EVEN WHEN IT'S HARD,

39:23.190 --> 39:25.556
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S HARD.

39:31.830 --> 39:33.969
AND FINALLY FOR
THESE TWO BOYS...

39:36.670 --> 39:39.332
WHO CAME INTO OUR LIVES
AND MADE US A FAMILY,

39:39.440 --> 39:41.635
AND WHO HAVE
GIVEN US A HOME

39:41.740 --> 39:44.641
EVERY BIT AS MUCH
AS WE HAVE THEM.

39:48.380 --> 39:50.348
- AMEN.
- AMEN.

39:50.450 --> 39:53.613
- AMEN.
- AMEN.

40:05.370 --> 40:07.429
( whispering )
SHE CAN'T BREATHE.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.361
SHE CAN'T GET ANY OXYGEN
TO HER BRAIN!

40:09.470 --> 40:11.859
( gasps )

40:11.970 --> 40:14.609
( Brenda sighs )

40:14.710 --> 40:18.908
- WHY CAN'T YOU LOVE HER?
- BECAUSE SHE'S DAMAGED...

40:20.010 --> 40:22.615
AND NOBODY WILL EVER
BE ABLE TO FIX HER.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.683
EVER.

40:31.320 --> 40:33.788
I TALKED TO
MY ACCOUNTANT TODAY.

40:37.630 --> 40:41.168
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,
WE CAN BUY RICO OUT.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.535
KEITH, I CAN'T LET YOU
DO THAT.

40:44.640 --> 40:47.006
- THAT MONEY IS YOURS.
- THAT MONEY IS OURS...

40:47.110 --> 40:50.307
FOR OUR NEW HOUSE.

40:50.410 --> 40:53.243
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE REALIZED,
BUT THAT HOUSE YOU GREW UP IN

40:53.350 --> 40:55.545
IS A PRETTY GREAT
FUCKIN' HOUSE.

40:57.720 --> 40:59.847
YOU DON'T FIND THIS
DEPRESSING?

40:59.950 --> 41:02.054
I DON'T THINK
IT HAS TO BE.

41:02.160 --> 41:05.584
I THINK WE CAN MAKE IT INTO
SOMETHING PRETTY SPECTACULAR.

41:07.290 --> 41:10.020
- YOU'RE SERIOUS?
- YEAH.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.797
IAM.

41:18.940 --> 41:22.535
- MAGGIE, DR. PETERMAN
WILL SEE YOU NOW.
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.146
( cell phone ringing )

41:26.250 --> 41:28.206
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.
SORRY.

41:28.310 --> 41:30.175
THIS IS MAGGIE.

41:30.280 --> 41:33.340
Ruth:
Thank heavens you still have
the same cell phone number.

41:33.450 --> 41:36.180
RUTH?

41:36.290 --> 41:38.383
I HAVE TO ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

41:38.490 --> 41:41.288
Sure.

41:41.390 --> 41:43.620
YOU WERE WITH NATE
THE NIGHT HE...

41:45.900 --> 41:49.563
- YES.
- WAS HE HAPPY?

41:51.140 --> 41:53.233
He was...

41:53.340 --> 41:56.400
feeling, I think,
that his life was
very complicated.

41:56.510 --> 41:59.877
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
HIS LIFE, I'M TALKING
ABOUT THAT NIGHT.

41:59.980 --> 42:01.868
WAS...

42:03.050 --> 42:04.915
WAS HE HAPPY?

42:07.050 --> 42:09.211
HE WAS.

42:13.890 --> 42:15.596
GOOD.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.922
WERE YOU?

42:23.540 --> 42:25.735
YES.

42:29.180 --> 42:30.932
YES, I WAS HAPPY.

42:31.040 --> 42:33.099
Good.

42:37.220 --> 42:39.211
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

42:42.520 --> 42:44.681
IT HELPS.

42:48.290 --> 42:50.292
RUTH...

42:50.400 --> 42:52.265
UM...

42:53.100 --> 42:55.568
I'M SORRY.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.862
I HAVE TO GO.

43:09.050 --> 43:11.746
David:
WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU
TO GIVE US ANYTHING.

43:11.850 --> 43:14.239
WE'RE JUST ASKING YOU
TO LET US BUY YOU OUT
OVER TIME.

43:14.350 --> 43:17.183
WE'LL PAY YOU
AS SOON AS WE CAN.
I PROMISE.

43:17.290 --> 43:18.951
OKAY.

43:20.530 --> 43:22.691
LOOK, MY DAD LEFT ME
A TON OF MONEY.

43:22.800 --> 43:26.759
PLUS, NATE HAD
LIFE INSURANCE,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

43:28.430 --> 43:31.831
- SO TAKE YOUR TIME.
- THANK YOU.

43:33.470 --> 43:35.301
COME ON, WE'RE FAMILY.

43:35.410 --> 43:37.901
YEAH, WE ARE.

43:38.010 --> 43:40.001
YES, WE ARE.

43:48.450 --> 43:51.089
- HELLO.
- OH, HELLO, RUTH.

43:51.190 --> 43:53.829
- HOW'S THE BABY DOING?
- SHE'S GOOD.

43:53.930 --> 43:56.819
OH! I HAVE NEW PHOTOS.

43:58.160 --> 44:00.720
OH, THANK YOU.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.761
OH MY GOODNESS!

44:06.870 --> 44:09.407
LOOK AT THOSE EYES!

44:10.810 --> 44:12.869
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
DO YOU SEE SOMETHING WRONG?

44:12.980 --> 44:17.314
OH NO, IT'S JUST THAT
IT SEEMS LIKE SHE SEES
MORE THAN WE DO,

44:17.420 --> 44:20.719
LIKE SHE'S
A VERY OLD SOUL.

44:23.220 --> 44:24.881
- HUH.
- YOU POOR DEAR.

44:24.990 --> 44:27.686
YOU'RE STILL WORRIED
ABOUT HER, AREN'T YOU?

44:29.230 --> 44:31.494
OH... SHE SEEMS GOOD.

44:31.600 --> 44:34.023
EVERY VISIT
TO THE DOCTOR GOES FINE.

44:34.130 --> 44:36.394
I JUST CAN'T
SHAKE THE FEELING

44:36.500 --> 44:39.230
THAT SOMETHING'
GOING TO GO WRONG,

44:39.340 --> 44:41.399
SOMETHING IS WRONG.

44:41.510 --> 44:43.728
YOU'RE ALL ALONE.

44:46.650 --> 44:48.811
IF MY EXPERIENCE
IS ANYTHING TO GO BY,

44:48.920 --> 44:52.708
MOTHERHOOD IS
THE LONELIEST THING
IN THE WORLD.

44:54.290 --> 44:57.259
NATHANIEL WASN'T EVEN HERE
WHEN NATE WAS BORN.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.521
HE WAS STILL IN VIETNAM.

44:59.630 --> 45:02.394
EVEN WHEN HE CAME HOME
AND DAVID WAS BORN

45:02.500 --> 45:04.229
AND HAVING
TERRIBLE ASTHMA,

45:04.330 --> 45:07.026
NATHANIEL WAS NEVER
REALLY HERE FOR ME.

45:07.130 --> 45:11.692
WHETHER IT WAS
THE WAR OR JUST HIM,
I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER KNOW.

45:13.470 --> 45:16.303
- YOU KNOW NATE AND I WERE--
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

45:16.410 --> 45:19.948
I KNOW HE LOVED YOU
THE VERY BEST HE COULD,

45:20.050 --> 45:23.747
AND I KNOW
YOU NEEDED MORE.

45:25.320 --> 45:27.345
SO DID I.

45:29.760 --> 45:32.684
AND I HOPE AND PRAY
THAT YOU PUT EVERYTHING--

45:32.790 --> 45:36.123
EVERYTHING BEHIND US
AND LET ME HELP YOU,

45:36.230 --> 45:39.461
BECAUSE I KNOW
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

45:41.800 --> 45:43.961
THANK YOU.

45:44.840 --> 45:46.728
I WILL NEED IT.

45:46.840 --> 45:49.479
I DO NEED IT.

45:58.150 --> 46:00.948
- DO WE HANCE) TO MOVE?

46:01.050 --> 46:05.259
WE'RE GONNA KEEP LIVING HERE.
MAYBE WE'LL MOVE, EVENTUALLY,

46:05.360 --> 46:06.850
IF THINGS GO WELL.

46:06.960 --> 46:08.222
BUT I LIKE THIS HOUSE.

46:08.330 --> 46:10.491
WHAT IF YOU GOT TO
HAVE YOUR OWN ROOM?

46:10.600 --> 46:13.296
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

46:14.700 --> 46:15.894
-TO...
-AH!

46:16.000 --> 46:17.661
- ...THE--
- AH!

46:17.770 --> 46:19.567
AH-- FUTURE.

46:19.670 --> 46:21.763
YES, BABY.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.442
( Ruth crying )

46:42.300 --> 46:44.291
MOM.

46:48.670 --> 46:50.831
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I KEEP LOOKING AT THIS.

46:56.340 --> 46:59.343
IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T MAKE ME
FEEL ANY BETTER.

47:14.900 --> 47:18.154
( kisses )

47:18.260 --> 47:22.333
GOD, I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING
IF I COULD MAKE THINGS
DIFFERENT FOR YOU.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.965
I WOULD TOO.

47:30.680 --> 47:32.602
YOU KNOW WHAT?

47:34.350 --> 47:36.568
I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA GO TO NEW YORK.

47:38.550 --> 47:41.747
OLIVIER SAYS
IT'S A CRAPPY PLACE
TO WORK ANYWAY.

47:41.850 --> 47:45.729
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO GO ABOUT FINDING
A PLACE TO LIVE.

47:45.830 --> 47:49.095
YOU WOULD DO THAT?

47:49.200 --> 47:52.089
YOU WOULD...
STAY HERE FOR ME?

47:56.600 --> 47:58.465
YES.

48:06.010 --> 48:08.171
ABSOLUTELY NOT!

48:10.480 --> 48:12.141
GO. LIVE.

48:12.250 --> 48:13.911
I'LL UNFREEZE
YOUR TRUST FUND.

48:14.020 --> 48:17.558
TAKE IT AND FIND
WHATEVER LIFE HAS
IN STORE FOR YOU.

48:17.660 --> 48:19.958
WELL...

48:20.060 --> 48:22.051
ARE YOU STILL GONNA
MOVE IN WITH GEORGE?

48:22.160 --> 48:24.754
NO, I'M MOVING IN
WITH SARAH.

48:24.860 --> 48:27.260
OH, SHE'S BACK
FROM COSTA RICA?

48:27.370 --> 48:29.998
NO, BETTINA'S HOUSE-SITTING,
BUT I'M MOVING IN ANYWAY.

48:30.100 --> 48:32.432
IF SARAH DOESN'T LIKE IT,
IT'S TOO FUCKING BAD.

48:32.540 --> 48:35.976
MOM, REALLY,
I CAN WAIT.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.969
CLAIRE, I STAYED HOME
TO TAKE CARE OF A SICK WOMAN,

48:39.080 --> 48:41.002
AND I'VE ALWAYS
REGRETTED IT.

48:42.120 --> 48:45.612
I DON'T REGRET YOU
OR ANY OF MY CHILDREN

48:45.720 --> 48:48.518
OR... NATHANIEL EVEN,

48:48.620 --> 48:50.986
BUT I DO REGRET

48:51.090 --> 48:53.729
NEVER GIVING MYSELF
ANY CHOICE.

48:53.830 --> 48:58.119
I WON'T LET YOU MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE!

49:01.400 --> 49:02.833
MOM.

49:02.940 --> 49:05.306
(crying )

49:08.010 --> 49:10.478
OH, MY LITTLE GIRL.

49:13.410 --> 49:15.469
( both crying )

49:18.150 --> 49:20.539
( Maya coughing )

49:24.590 --> 49:26.558
MAYA?

49:29.700 --> 49:32.191
MAYA, ARE YOU OKAY?

49:37.840 --> 49:39.603
( sighs )

50:02.660 --> 50:04.992
Nate:
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

50:06.200 --> 50:08.725
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

50:10.100 --> 50:13.604
HI. WE'VE NEVER MET.
I'M NATHANIEL.

50:21.080 --> 50:23.548
I LOVE HER SO MUCH.

50:24.720 --> 50:27.211
AND I ALWAYS WILL.

50:43.740 --> 50:45.708
( Willa coos )

51:19.070 --> 51:21.709
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T LISTEN TO THIS

51:21.810 --> 51:25.109
UNTIL YOU START TO DRIVE AWAY
TOMORROW MORNING.

51:26.410 --> 51:29.846
I CAN'T PLAY IT TONIGHT
AT MY BIG FAREWELL DINNER...

51:29.950 --> 51:31.679
THAT YOU WON'T
EVEN COME TO?

51:31.780 --> 51:35.557
( sighs )
EVERYBODY'S GONNA
WANT A PIECE OF YOU.

51:36.920 --> 51:39.980
I'M SORRY, BUT...

51:40.090 --> 51:42.229
I DON'T WANT
TO SHARE YOU.

51:43.630 --> 51:45.564
THAT'S SWEET.

51:46.800 --> 51:50.133
AND STRANGELY
POSSESSIVE.

51:55.180 --> 51:57.899
I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME
SOMETHING TOO.

51:58.010 --> 52:00.001
I WANT YOU TO PROMISE

52:00.110 --> 52:03.876
THAT IF THE CORPORATE
WARMONGERS DECIDE WE
HAVE TO INVADE IRAN

52:03.980 --> 52:06.881
- AND THEY
REINSTATE THE DRAFT...
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

52:06.990 --> 52:09.481
- ...THAT YOU WILL
MOVE TO CANADA.
- IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

52:09.590 --> 52:13.151
PROBABLY NOT.
BUT, IF THEY DO...

52:13.260 --> 52:16.593
PROMISE ME...

52:16.700 --> 52:18.588
THAT YOU WON'T GO
GET YOUR HEAD BLOWN OFF

52:18.700 --> 52:21.760
SO HALLIBURTON AND
BECHTEL CAN GET RICHER.

52:21.870 --> 52:24.464
I PROMISE.

52:27.570 --> 52:31.870
YOU'RE TOO SMART.
YOU'RE TOO GOOD.

52:34.080 --> 52:36.776
DON'T WASTE THAT.

52:44.760 --> 52:47.479
I PROMISE.

52:54.070 --> 52:56.038
- A WHAT?
- A METH LAB.

52:56.140 --> 52:57.289
( laughing )
MARCIE, GET SERIOUS!

52:57.400 --> 52:59.038
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

52:59.140 --> 53:01.028
IT'S ILLEGAL AND
SHE'S PULLING YOUR LEG.

53:01.140 --> 53:02.573
WE'D MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.

53:02.680 --> 53:05.478
SO COULD OPENING OUR OWN
PROFESSIONAL ASSASSIN SERVICE,

53:05.580 --> 53:07.502
BUT THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN EITHER.

53:07.610 --> 53:09.441
WHY NOT?
I THINK I'D LIKE THAT.

53:09.550 --> 53:11.848
WE COULD STEAL
PEOPLE'S KIDNEYS.

53:11.950 --> 53:14.418
OH, GOD, NO!
IT'S TOO MESSY.

53:14.520 --> 53:18.479
OOH, OOH!
I HEARD ON NPR

53:18.590 --> 53:22.856
ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE
THAT GO IN AND CLEAN UP
VIOLENT CRIME SCENES.

53:22.960 --> 53:25.758
- THEY MAKE
A SHITLOARCSJIF MONEY!

53:25.870 --> 53:29.260
I'M NOT GOING TO
CLEAN UP SOMEONE ELSE'S
VIOLENT CRIME.

53:29.370 --> 53:32.533
OH, WE JUST
HAVE TO ACCEPT IT.

53:32.640 --> 53:36.337
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE.
WE HAVE TO BECOME HOOKERS.

53:36.440 --> 53:39.136
I'M THINKING OF STARTING
A DAY-CARE SERVICE.

53:39.250 --> 53:42.572
- SERIOUSLY?
- YES, FOR DOGS.

53:42.680 --> 53:45.513
( all laugh )

53:47.290 --> 53:50.111
WELL, I WASN'T AWARE
SUCH A THING EXISTED

53:50.220 --> 53:53.018
UNTIL NATE WORKED IN ONE
BRIEFLY LAST YEAR.

53:53.130 --> 53:57.419
BUT APPARENTLY
A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL
PAY YOU A LOT OF MONEY

53:57.530 --> 53:59.498
TO BABYSIT THEIR DOGS.

53:59.600 --> 54:02.797
LET'S FACE IT,
DOGS ARE A LOT
EASIER THAN CHILDREN.

54:02.900 --> 54:04.788
THEY JUST ARE.

54:04.900 --> 54:07.403
NO OFFENSE, HON.

54:07.510 --> 54:09.330
OH, THERE'S GEORGE.

54:09.440 --> 54:12.898
Ruth:
HI, GEORGE.
COME JOIN US.

54:14.280 --> 54:17.772
Bettina:
GEORGIE PORGIE.
HE HATES ME.

54:18.920 --> 54:20.888
( phone rings )

54:23.560 --> 54:25.357
( machine beeps )

54:25.460 --> 54:27.428
Claire, hi,
this is Gavin at New Image

54:27.530 --> 54:29.828
and I hate to be the one
to tell you this, but...

54:29.930 --> 54:32.569
New Image has been bought
by Stock Aid,

54:32.670 --> 54:35.468
and they're consolidating
their operations, and...

54:35.570 --> 54:40.064
well, they're in Chicago,
so I hope you haven't
headed out here yet.

54:40.170 --> 54:43.901
- Um, sorry.
- ( machine beeps )

54:46.880 --> 54:50.213
AW, WHO CARES?

54:50.320 --> 54:52.743
GO ANYWAY.

54:52.850 --> 54:54.408
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?

54:54.520 --> 54:56.852
I'M GONNA MOVE
TO NEW YORK CITY
WITHOUT A JOB?

54:56.960 --> 55:00.589
MOM GAVE YOU THE MONEY,
YOU'RE GONNA LAND SOMEWHERE.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

55:00.690 --> 55:03.727
- ( sighs )
- YOU'RE TALENTED,
YOU'RE SMART,

55:03.830 --> 55:07.163
- YOU'RE READY.
- WHAT IF I'M NOT?

55:07.270 --> 55:09.488
CLAIRE, YOU WANT
TO KNOW A SECRET?

55:10.600 --> 55:12.465
I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE
BEING SCARED.

55:12.570 --> 55:15.471
SCARED OF NOT BEING READY,
OF NOT BEING RIGHT,

55:15.580 --> 55:17.502
OF NOT BEING
WHO I SHOULD BE.

55:17.610 --> 55:20.579
AND WHERE DID IT GET ME?

55:25.420 --> 55:27.183
WHAT SHOULD I TELL
EVERYONE TONIGHT?

55:27.290 --> 55:29.144
NOTHING!

55:29.250 --> 55:31.286
( sighs )

55:31.390 --> 55:34.450
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE!

55:38.460 --> 55:40.325
_ ( laughter)
- ( rock music playing )

55:40.430 --> 55:43.263
George:
WOW, YOU'VE DONE
A GREAT JOB.

55:43.370 --> 55:46.032
AND THIS IS
VIDEO GAME CENTRAL.

55:47.570 --> 55:50.505
I'VE MADE IT TO MOSCOW
ON "TONY HAWK UNDERGROUND."

55:50.610 --> 55:52.578
HMM.
THAT'LL COME
IN HANDY.

55:52.680 --> 55:55.240
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
THE RESPECT IT BOUGHT ME.

55:55.350 --> 55:57.272
HO, BOY, WHAT HAVE
YOU DONE IN HERE?

55:57.380 --> 55:58.938
WELL, WE REPLACED
THE JALOUSIE WINDOWS

55:59.050 --> 56:02.679
- WITH THESE
DOUBLE-HUNG WINDOWS.
- THAT LOOKS GREAT.

56:05.020 --> 56:06.351
( giggles )

56:06.460 --> 56:08.223
Ruth:
IT'S LIKE I NEVER
LIVED HERE.

56:08.330 --> 56:12.767
- THERE'S SO
MUCH SPACE, THOUGH.
- JUST BEIGE, THOUGH.

56:12.870 --> 56:14.826
BEIGE BEIGE BEIGE.

56:14.930 --> 56:18.491
- I LOVE THIS.
- OH, THIS IS THE--

56:22.070 --> 56:23.606
HA!
THREE FOURS.

56:23.710 --> 56:27.749
- DOES IT HURT
TO HAVE A BABY?
- YES, IT DOES.

56:27.850 --> 56:30.944
IT'S BEAUTIFUL I ADMIT IT,
BUT IT'S A LITTLE INTIMIDATING.

56:31.050 --> 56:33.189
( whispering )
IT'S GAY.

56:33.290 --> 56:35.383
THIS IS A 100% GAY
KITCHEN.

56:35.490 --> 56:37.310
THIS TABLE LOOKS
SORT OF OUT OF PLACE.

56:37.420 --> 56:39.285
DAVID SAYS THEY KEEP
MEANING TO GET RID OF IT.

56:39.390 --> 56:41.324
I SUPPOSE THEY'LL
GET AROUND TO IT.

56:41.430 --> 56:43.250
( laughing )

56:43.360 --> 56:46.818
OH MY GOD, YOU REMEMBER
THAT ONE DINNER THAT
HE CAME TO

56:46.930 --> 56:51.765
AND HE WAS HIGH
ON ECSTASY, WHICH HE
HAD TAKEN BY ACCIDENT?

56:51.870 --> 56:55.636
- WHAT'S ECSTASY?
- IT'S MEDICINE.

56:55.740 --> 56:57.731
- ( laughing )
- I MUST HAVE MISSED
THAT ONE.

56:57.840 --> 57:00.877
NATE KEPT GROPING
MY BREASTS THROUGH
THE MEAL.

57:00.980 --> 57:02.811
I WAS MORTIFIED.

57:02.920 --> 57:05.809
I WALKED IN ON THE TWO
OF YOU IN MUCH MORE
MORTIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES.

57:05.920 --> 57:08.582
OKAY, THAT WE WILL NOT
GET INTO WITH YOUNGER EARS
AT THE TABLE.

57:08.690 --> 57:13.627
- WHAT? TELL ME.
- WHAT, TELL ME!

57:13.730 --> 57:17.450
I JUST REMEMBER--
I DON'T KNOW, I WAS
IN SEVENTH GRADE,

57:17.560 --> 57:20.723
NATE WAS PROBABLY
A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL...

57:20.830 --> 57:23.628
AND HE HAD STARTED
THAT NEW WAVE BAND

57:23.740 --> 57:25.765
WITH SAM HOVIAK
AND TOM WHEELER,
DO YOU REMEMBER?

57:25.870 --> 57:27.667
I DO.

57:27.770 --> 57:32.469
HE HAD THE WORST HAIR.
I MEAN REALLY BIG,
BAD '805 HAIR

57:32.580 --> 57:34.548
WITH ALL THIS SPRAY
AND LACQUER IN IT.

57:34.650 --> 57:37.346
AND I WAS SITTING
NEXT TO HIM AT DINNER,

57:37.450 --> 57:39.372
AND I SAW SOMETHING MOVE,

57:39.490 --> 57:41.287
AND IT WAS A SPIDER.

57:41.390 --> 57:42.948
IT HAD SPUN A WEB
IN HIS HAIR.

57:43.060 --> 57:44.311
I SWEAR.

57:44.420 --> 57:48.129
- ( all laughing )
- Anthony: SICK!

57:48.230 --> 57:51.893
AND I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
BECAUSE I KNEW HOW COOL
HE WAS TRYING TO BE.

57:53.770 --> 57:58.366
I WANTED HIM
TO BE THAT COOL.
I WANTED HIM TO BE...

57:58.470 --> 58:02.679
THE COOLEST BROTHER
ANYBODY HAD EVER HAD.

58:11.320 --> 58:13.788
TO NATE.

58:18.060 --> 58:19.755
TO NATE.

58:19.860 --> 58:22.226
TO NATE.

58:22.330 --> 58:26.528
- TO NATE.
- TO NATE.

58:28.370 --> 58:30.167
TO MY FIRST-BORN.

58:31.500 --> 58:34.765
- TO UNCLE NATE.
- YEAH, TO UNCLE NATE.

58:37.610 --> 58:39.498
CAN YOU SAY "TO DADDY"?

58:39.610 --> 58:41.805
TO DADDY.

58:41.910 --> 58:45.641
TO NATE.

58:57.330 --> 58:59.594
David:
MAY HE REST IN PEACE.

59:03.100 --> 59:05.705
( singing "I Just
Want to Celebrate" )

59:17.050 --> 59:19.712

59:57.660 --> 1:00:00.879
I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO DO THIS.

1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:04.949
YOU JUST SAY "GOODBYE."

1:00:09.330 --> 1:00:11.594
AND JUST SAY
"I LOVE YOU."

1:00:13.170 --> 1:00:14.865
I'LL MISS YOU.

1:00:14.970 --> 1:00:18.030
OH GOD, I'M GONNA
MISS YOU SO MUCH.

1:00:19.210 --> 1:00:21.678

1:00:43.300 --> 1:00:46.337
DON'T LET THEM WORK YOU
TOO HARD AT YOUR NEW JOB.

1:00:46.440 --> 1:00:49.671
I WON'T.

1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:53.542
MOM, I REALLY HOPE
YOU CAN COME AND VISIT.

1:00:53.650 --> 1:00:55.641

1:00:55.750 --> 1:00:59.208
OH, CLAIRE.

1:01:00.950 --> 1:01:06.126
I PRAY YOU WILL BE
FILLED WITH HOPE AS LONG

1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:15.418
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

1:01:15.530 --> 1:01:18.738
AND THANK YOU

1:01:19.910 --> 1:01:21.798

1:01:21.910 --> 1:01:23.673
OH, GOD, I DON'T
WANT TO GO.

1:01:23.780 --> 1:01:25.998

1:01:26.110 --> 1:01:28.647
Keith:

THE FIRE DEPARTMENT MUSEUM?

1:01:45.660 --> 1:01:48.128

1:01:48.230 --> 1:01:50.494

TO BE A FIREMAN.

1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:52.397

USED TO BE A COP?

1:01:52.500 --> 1:01:54.104

IN HIS UNIFORM.

1:01:56.240 --> 1:01:58.231

1:02:07.320 --> 1:02:09.788
OH, I WANT TO TAKE
A PICTURE OF EVERYONE.

1:02:12.860 --> 1:02:16.091
YOU CAN'T TAKE
A PICTURE OF THIS.
IT'S ALREADY GONE.

1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:17.758
( shutter snaps )

1:02:31.780 --> 1:02:36.217
( "Breathe Me" playing )

1:03:17.820 --> 1:03:20.254
SO AS THE BLOOD IS
DRAINING OUT OF THE BODY

1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:22.180
IT FLOWS DOWN
INTO THAT DRAIN THERE.

1:03:22.290 --> 1:03:24.520
IT'S REPLACED WITH
THIS EMBALMING FLUID.

1:03:30.140 --> 1:03:32.961

1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:33.058

1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:03.973
SO I'M EXPECT ING--
I'M EXPECTING

1:07:04.080 --> 1:07:06.139

1:07:06.250 --> 1:07:07.808

EMOTIONAL RESPONSE.

1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:10.616
TED RESPONDED
IN A WAY THAT

1:07:10.720 --> 1:07:13.518
I FELT SOME EMOTIONAL

1:07:17.800 --> 1:07:20.121
