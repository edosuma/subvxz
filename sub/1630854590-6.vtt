01:35.253 --> 01:36.487
Where is your son now?

01:37.955 --> 01:39.924
Bringing in the other flock.

01:39.924 --> 01:42.760
He'll be back soon.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.762
Then send him for my father?

01:44.762 --> 01:46.230
Then feed him supper.

01:46.230 --> 01:48.065
Then he sleeps.

01:49.634 --> 01:51.202
Then send him for your father.

04:22.486 --> 04:23.921
Maybe we bury them.

04:27.425 --> 04:28.926
Bury them deep.

04:28.926 --> 04:30.995
By the creek where
the ground is soft.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.866
- Hole won't look fresh then.
- Mm.

04:35.866 --> 04:37.201
Yeah.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.838
Issaxche Rainwater?

05:13.838 --> 05:15.239
That is me.

05:15.239 --> 05:16.874
Your granddaughter
is Teonna Rainwater,

05:16.874 --> 05:18.743
enrolled at the U.S. school
for Native Americans?

05:18.743 --> 05:20.044
Yes?

05:22.213 --> 05:23.614
I have a warrant
for her arrest.

05:23.614 --> 05:24.715
Please step aside.

05:25.950 --> 05:28.486
You say she is murdered?

05:28.486 --> 05:30.087
I say she <i>did</i> the murders.

05:30.087 --> 05:32.156
She killed two teachers
at the school. Now step aside.

05:32.156 --> 05:35.259
My granddaughter?
You make no sense.

05:38.696 --> 05:41.866
Why-why are you here?
What are you doing?

05:51.909 --> 05:54.678
I saw a barn out back.
Check it. Check the teepee.

06:00.951 --> 06:03.854
Harboring a fugitive
is a felony.

06:03.854 --> 06:06.023
What is a fugitive?

06:11.095 --> 06:12.530
Get out of my house now!

06:21.772 --> 06:22.840
Ain't no sign of her in the...

06:24.742 --> 06:26.343
What happened here?

06:26.343 --> 06:28.078
She attacked me.

06:28.078 --> 06:29.380
I pushed her back.

06:29.380 --> 06:31.982
She must have hit her head
on the stove.

06:33.384 --> 06:36.654
Why are you asking?

06:36.654 --> 06:39.990
You were here, you saw everything.

06:39.990 --> 06:42.426
Didn't you.

06:42.426 --> 06:46.030
Yeah.
Yeah, she attacked you.

06:50.301 --> 06:51.502
Let's keep looking.

08:41.979 --> 08:43.013
Alex!

08:45.215 --> 08:47.117
Alex!

08:49.853 --> 08:51.055
Alex!

08:57.027 --> 08:58.028
Alex!

09:06.136 --> 09:07.237
Alex!

09:09.373 --> 09:10.474
I'm coming!

09:35.499 --> 09:37.701
Spencer!

09:42.606 --> 09:44.274
Come on.

09:44.274 --> 09:46.010
Catch your breath.

09:46.010 --> 09:47.311
How well do you swim?

09:47.311 --> 09:50.914
Under normal circumstances,
I would say quite well.

09:53.417 --> 09:54.718
Hang on.

10:06.096 --> 10:07.498
- Hang on to these, okay?
- Okay.

10:11.769 --> 10:13.270
- Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:51.909 --> 10:54.278
What happened?

10:54.278 --> 10:56.714
Ghost ship hit us.

10:56.714 --> 10:58.282
How long can this stay afloat?

10:58.849 --> 10:59.850
I don't know.

10:59.850 --> 11:01.618
Doesn't really matter.

11:01.618 --> 11:04.722
We're not gonna make through
the day without water or shade.

11:10.828 --> 11:13.630
Hey. I gotta go back down.

11:13.630 --> 11:14.965
What for?

11:14.965 --> 11:16.066
We need things.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.837
Hey, stay here.

11:21.605 --> 11:22.906
That was a dumb thing to say.

11:22.906 --> 11:24.641
Just stay in the
center of the hull.

11:24.641 --> 11:26.009
Don't go towards the edge.

11:26.009 --> 11:27.878
I'll stay in the center.

11:27.878 --> 11:30.247
- Be right back.
- You'd better.

12:24.334 --> 12:27.905
Alex!

12:37.815 --> 12:39.016
Spencer!

12:50.460 --> 12:51.795
We're drifting away from it!

12:53.397 --> 12:54.865
We swim right now or we die.

12:54.865 --> 12:56.300
Okay?

13:00.370 --> 13:01.972
Come on!

13:01.972 --> 13:03.073
Keep going!

13:04.408 --> 13:05.609
Swim as hard as you can!

13:09.079 --> 13:10.147
There you go! Keep going!

13:11.014 --> 13:12.049
Come on!

13:20.991 --> 13:23.060
This way. Come on. Come on.

13:31.001 --> 13:32.903
Not your sharpest moment.

13:32.903 --> 13:34.071
I'm aware, thank you.

13:35.305 --> 13:37.541
This is not how
I thought I'd die.

13:37.541 --> 13:39.977
Because it isn't.
Look at me.

13:39.977 --> 13:41.645
This is hopeless.

13:42.713 --> 13:44.481
Is it hopeless?

13:44.481 --> 13:46.550
I'll admit we're gonna
need a little bit of luck.

13:46.550 --> 13:48.852
We're certainly due some.

13:48.852 --> 13:50.554
May not feel like it now...

13:51.922 --> 13:54.391
but sitting on this hull
is about the luckiest thing

13:54.391 --> 13:56.360
that ever happened to you.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.896
I made contact with a ship
before we went down.

13:58.896 --> 14:02.132
They know we're here, okay?

14:02.132 --> 14:05.002
Wanna hope for something?

14:06.303 --> 14:08.672
Hope they're coming. Okay?

14:11.241 --> 14:13.043
Try and get all of
yourself underneath.

14:14.578 --> 14:16.179
What about you?

14:17.447 --> 14:18.982
I'm gonna work on my tan.

14:53.865 --> 14:55.066
I'll catch up.

14:59.303 --> 15:00.405
Good to see you moving.

15:00.405 --> 15:04.308
Glad someone enjoys
seeing me moving.

15:04.308 --> 15:06.911
I sure don't.

15:06.911 --> 15:08.780
Pretty stiff?

15:08.780 --> 15:12.984
Damn bed sucked all
my strength from me.

15:12.984 --> 15:14.452
You were in it a while.

15:14.452 --> 15:16.954
Might sleep standing
up from now on.

15:16.954 --> 15:19.957
Well, if you figure out that
trick, gotta teach it to me.

15:19.957 --> 15:21.259
Spencer's coming home.

15:21.259 --> 15:23.261
From where?

15:23.261 --> 15:25.263
Cara sent the last
letter to Africa.

15:25.263 --> 15:27.265
That sounds like a long trip.

15:27.265 --> 15:31.569
Six, eight weeks on a ship.
Another week on the train.

15:31.569 --> 15:33.871
Then we get after their asses.

15:33.871 --> 15:36.174
Start asking around real quiet

15:36.174 --> 15:38.242
about who wants to
be on the posse.

15:38.242 --> 15:41.646
Half the cowboys around
here went to California.

15:41.646 --> 15:43.781
Quitters went to California.

15:43.781 --> 15:47.051
Tough ones are still here.
Find some.

15:48.152 --> 15:49.687
Want me to saddle you a horse?

15:49.687 --> 15:51.689
No, I think
I'll just walk for today.

15:51.689 --> 15:54.058
Make sure I don't
come unstitched.

16:02.400 --> 16:03.601
Have a seat, Spur.

16:06.838 --> 16:08.439
Are you currently employed?

16:11.476 --> 16:13.110
Ma'am?

16:13.110 --> 16:16.080
Do you have a job?

16:16.080 --> 16:17.715
In the spring I have a job.

16:17.715 --> 16:18.850
When the snow melts.

16:18.850 --> 16:20.184
What ranch?

16:20.184 --> 16:23.921
Ma'am, why are you so curious
about where I work?

16:23.921 --> 16:26.657
Well, you're applying for the
position of Livestock Agent.

16:26.657 --> 16:28.526
It would stand to
reason we consider

16:28.526 --> 16:31.095
your previous employment
while making a decision.

16:31.095 --> 16:32.697
Who's conducting
this interview?

16:32.697 --> 16:34.398
I am.

16:34.398 --> 16:36.100
What the hell does a woman
know about law enforcement?

16:36.100 --> 16:37.768
Absolutely nothing.

16:37.768 --> 16:39.570
But I know men.

16:39.570 --> 16:41.606
You see, I can look in
a man's eye and know

16:41.606 --> 16:45.343
if he can be trusted, if he
can maintain his composure

16:45.343 --> 16:47.245
while facing adversity.

16:47.245 --> 16:50.815
An element of this interview
you seem to be failing.

16:52.483 --> 16:54.118
My own mama never
talked to me like that.

16:54.118 --> 16:55.553
Mm. Maybe she should've.

16:55.553 --> 16:58.122
Ain't a fucking woman
on this--

17:00.691 --> 17:02.093
I'm afraid you lack
the temperament

17:02.093 --> 17:03.628
this job requires.

17:03.628 --> 17:05.162
We thank you for your interest.

17:06.297 --> 17:07.465
And don't forget your hat.

17:10.902 --> 17:13.738
Go easy on the head busting.

17:13.738 --> 17:16.107
Nobody speaks
to my aunt like that.

17:16.107 --> 17:17.708
We've been at it all morning.

17:17.708 --> 17:20.011
And we've only found two.

17:20.011 --> 17:22.213
It's a dangerous job
that don't pay well.

17:22.213 --> 17:24.348
We're gonna have to sort through
a lot of drifters and bullies

17:24.348 --> 17:26.918
to find true believers, ma'am.

17:33.591 --> 17:35.259
- Have a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

17:35.259 --> 17:38.763
So, are you
currently employed?

17:38.763 --> 17:39.964
No, ma'am.

17:39.964 --> 17:41.732
I have a homestead north
of Big Timber.

17:41.732 --> 17:43.534
That's a long ride
from Big Timber.

17:43.534 --> 17:44.735
Three days or more.

17:44.735 --> 17:46.203
But three hours by train.

17:46.203 --> 17:48.139
Them engines shrink
the world, aye?

17:48.139 --> 17:49.540
For better or for worse.

17:49.540 --> 17:51.208
I think worse in the long run.

17:51.208 --> 17:53.811
You may be right.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.546
We should mark
the calendar, ma'am.

17:55.546 --> 17:57.415
It's rare when that happens.

17:57.415 --> 17:59.850
I've seen you before.

17:59.850 --> 18:01.686
At the Civic Center.

18:01.686 --> 18:04.555
I don't miss a meeting.

18:04.555 --> 18:07.825
McDowell: What makes you want to
be a Livestock Agent?

18:07.825 --> 18:12.430
Well, if you think the
thieving's bad here, go east.

18:12.430 --> 18:14.031
Go where there's
no cities at all

18:14.031 --> 18:16.067
and a straight shot
to Sheridan...

18:16.067 --> 18:17.868
No big ranches my way.

18:17.868 --> 18:19.904
If we lose ten head, we feel it.

18:19.904 --> 18:22.239
We lose twenty
and we're out of business.

18:22.239 --> 18:24.575
Plus, I know the life.

18:29.347 --> 18:32.149
Was a copper during the war,
when the stockyards was booming.

18:32.149 --> 18:33.284
Half the city drunk,

18:33.284 --> 18:36.220
trying to beat and
steal from the other half.

18:36.220 --> 18:37.755
Why'd you quit?

18:37.755 --> 18:38.889
The smell.

18:38.889 --> 18:41.425
Fifteen million cattle
and three million people

18:41.425 --> 18:43.894
all belching and pissing
and screaming and fighting.

18:43.894 --> 18:47.064
crammed together
in the same place.

18:47.064 --> 18:52.870
My apologies, ma'am, but there's
no gentle way to describe it.

18:52.870 --> 18:56.774
I don't know what hell is but
it ain't worse than Chicago.

18:56.774 --> 18:59.644
Now I try to limit the time
my feet spend on concrete.

19:01.679 --> 19:04.181
Well, thank you for your
interest, we'll discuss--

19:08.386 --> 19:09.920
Sign there you received it.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.023
Pays two-hundred
and twenty a month.

19:12.023 --> 19:13.924
Better than Chicago.

19:13.924 --> 19:15.793
A little more risk here.

19:15.793 --> 19:17.662
I don't know about that.

19:17.662 --> 19:20.598
We have an orientation
at 8:00 A.M. tomorrow,

19:20.598 --> 19:22.967
you'll receive your book
of penal codes,

19:22.967 --> 19:24.902
and a firearm if you
don't have one.

19:24.902 --> 19:26.804
I'm plenty armed, thank you.

19:28.139 --> 19:30.408
Ma'am, it's been a pleasure.

19:30.408 --> 19:31.542
Thank you for the opportunity.

19:39.684 --> 19:40.985
How many is that?

19:40.985 --> 19:41.986
Three.

19:41.986 --> 19:44.622
Jacob said we need
at least twenty.

19:44.622 --> 19:47.258
We'll get there.
It's just gonna take some time.

19:47.258 --> 19:48.526
We don't have any time.

19:48.526 --> 19:51.796
Cara, time is the one
thing we have in abundance.

19:51.796 --> 19:53.597
<i>You</i> have it in abundance.

19:56.634 --> 20:00.705
My family, however,
has run out.

20:04.909 --> 20:06.811
I need to show you
something, Will.

20:33.904 --> 20:34.939
What is that?

20:35.639 --> 20:36.907
Schools of little fish

20:36.907 --> 20:39.577
collecting in the shade
beneath the boat.

20:42.480 --> 20:43.948
What's that?

20:46.550 --> 20:48.819
Bigger fish.

20:48.819 --> 20:50.421
Tuna, I think.

20:58.929 --> 21:00.164
Are we in danger?

21:00.164 --> 21:04.201
More danger than we were
five minutes ago, I mean?

21:04.201 --> 21:05.669
I wouldn't go swimming.

21:08.672 --> 21:12.543
Think about
it like this...

21:12.543 --> 21:15.946
In the last six hours

21:15.946 --> 21:18.783
this ocean has adapted
to this boat being here.

21:19.850 --> 21:22.853
Taking advantage of it.

21:22.853 --> 21:27.424
People think they're so smart.

21:29.860 --> 21:32.062
People ain't that smart.

21:34.431 --> 21:37.935
You might be.
I know I am.

21:40.871 --> 21:44.608
I learn from my mistakes,

21:44.608 --> 21:46.110
but I still make plenty.

21:47.845 --> 21:49.847
Like our current situation.

21:49.847 --> 21:53.217
Are you saying this was
likely your last tugboat ride?

21:56.587 --> 21:58.956
No matter how this shakes out,

21:58.956 --> 22:01.992
this was my last tugboat ride.

22:06.063 --> 22:10.901
I refuse to be scared.

22:10.901 --> 22:12.236
Refuse it.

22:14.405 --> 22:16.240
I will not feel
sorry for myself.

22:19.376 --> 22:21.679
If death is our fate
I will draw my last breath

22:21.679 --> 22:24.114
and kiss you with it.
I swear to God.

22:34.692 --> 22:35.960
It ain't our fate.

22:38.596 --> 22:40.464
You're gonna need another
reason to kiss me.

23:20.638 --> 23:23.941
Aw. This makes me smile.

23:25.809 --> 23:28.946
You wouldn't be smiling if you
knew what I was waiting for.

23:28.946 --> 23:30.781
I don't care what
you're waiting for

23:30.781 --> 23:34.752
so long as you're
standing there doing it.

23:34.752 --> 23:37.154
What are you waiting for?

23:37.154 --> 23:40.624
See that mountain?
About two-thirds of the way up?

23:42.192 --> 23:45.095
- See that?
- Yes. What is that?

23:45.095 --> 23:47.598
They're cutting a road.

23:47.598 --> 23:49.466
Up the side of a mountain?

23:49.466 --> 23:52.236
A road to nowhere, then?

23:52.236 --> 23:53.804
A road to somewhere.

23:55.139 --> 23:57.875
Guess you're gonna be holding
nursing me back to health

23:57.875 --> 24:00.044
pretty high over my head, huh?

24:02.079 --> 24:04.315
Put it this way.

24:04.315 --> 24:06.483
There is no more debate
about a generator.

24:07.551 --> 24:08.686
Ahh.

24:08.686 --> 24:11.989
Or a clothes-washing machine.

24:11.989 --> 24:13.724
Pretty expensive nurse.

24:13.724 --> 24:16.660
And you might want to lean on
your cane for this one.

24:18.028 --> 24:20.364
- Don't say it.
- Motor car.

24:20.364 --> 24:22.566
Oh my God. Jesus...

24:24.335 --> 24:26.303
Suppose there's no way
I could kind of

24:26.303 --> 24:28.939
just ease into this modern age?

24:28.939 --> 24:32.543
Yes, of course. I'll let you
choose which one we get first.

24:32.543 --> 24:34.545
That's mighty generous of you.

24:35.713 --> 24:37.314
You find
any more men today?

24:37.314 --> 24:39.149
Fewer than I'd hoped.

24:39.149 --> 24:43.554
Well, what we can't hire,
I'll raise in a posse.

24:43.554 --> 24:47.291
You leave all
the fighting to the agents.

24:47.291 --> 24:49.059
I'm not going
through that again.

24:49.059 --> 24:51.261
It's not my intention
to get shot.

24:51.261 --> 24:54.798
Nor is it my intention
to become a widow.

24:54.798 --> 24:58.869
So, all those thoughts
of justice in your head...

24:58.869 --> 25:00.437
They stay there.

25:02.006 --> 25:03.173
They're blasting a mine

25:03.173 --> 25:06.610
right above this ranch's
main water supply.

25:06.610 --> 25:09.380
They own the property
to the north now.

25:09.380 --> 25:13.283
And to the south.

25:13.283 --> 25:15.185
To squeeze what's in the middle.

25:16.887 --> 25:18.422
And what's in the middle is us.

25:19.857 --> 25:21.925
Justice would be a luxury.

25:24.094 --> 25:25.829
My concern is survival.

25:27.798 --> 25:29.433
I know.

25:29.433 --> 25:31.668
That's why I did it.

25:32.936 --> 25:35.305
Did what?

25:40.444 --> 25:42.613
Don't be mad.

25:42.613 --> 25:43.914
I did it for you.

26:04.977 --> 26:07.579
For God sakes, Jacob,
you're a damned law man.

26:07.579 --> 26:09.581
You know how bad this looks?

26:09.581 --> 26:11.850
It's just like I said.

26:11.850 --> 26:15.387
And there's a dozen
witnesses say the same.

26:15.387 --> 26:17.289
But no proof anywhere.

26:17.289 --> 26:18.690
You want some fucking proof?

26:18.690 --> 26:20.158
I'll show you
some fucking proof!

26:20.158 --> 26:23.395
And there's more proof
buried in our graveyard here

26:23.395 --> 26:26.698
and even more proof shipped
back east and buried there.

26:26.698 --> 26:28.734
Where's all the bodies
of all the Creighton men?

26:28.734 --> 26:32.804
Rotting on the Wyoming border.

26:32.804 --> 26:34.106
Mm-hmm.

26:34.106 --> 26:36.908
Well, you sure got
a lot done for a dead man.

26:36.908 --> 26:38.043
What would you have
done different?

26:38.043 --> 26:40.045
I would have told the sheriff.

26:40.045 --> 26:42.314
You think you could've
kept the bank away,

26:42.314 --> 26:45.150
along with every thief
from Laramie to Whitefish?

26:45.150 --> 26:48.453
I understand what
the bank would've done.

26:48.453 --> 26:52.290
And I know what the thieves
would've done if you'd died.

26:52.290 --> 26:53.458
But you didn't.

26:53.458 --> 26:56.561
And you still sat on this.

26:56.561 --> 27:00.699
Now, I know what you're up to,
and I won't allow it.

27:00.699 --> 27:02.434
Wyoming's already
had a range war,

27:02.434 --> 27:03.969
Montana ain't
having another.

27:06.605 --> 27:08.740
I'll arrest him in the morning.

27:08.740 --> 27:12.811
In the meantime, everybody,
and that means you,

27:12.811 --> 27:14.579
gives a statement
to the deputies.

27:33.498 --> 27:35.200
Damn right, I'm mad.

27:38.537 --> 27:39.538
Jacob.

27:41.039 --> 27:42.874
Jacob.

27:53.719 --> 27:54.720
Jacob...

28:04.963 --> 28:07.566
How dare you give
your back to me?

28:08.967 --> 28:11.103
After all I've given to you.

28:12.404 --> 28:14.539
It's not even justice.

28:14.539 --> 28:17.309
It's more petty than that.

28:17.309 --> 28:19.711
It's vengeance you seek.

28:21.646 --> 28:24.082
Never mind he'll be
arrested in the morning.

28:24.082 --> 28:27.819
You'd rather put the bullet
in him yourself.

28:27.819 --> 28:31.123
Then it's you in prison and
the ranch is lost all the same.

28:33.258 --> 28:34.693
You think it's you
who's suffered the most?

28:34.693 --> 28:37.262
How would you know, you were
asleep half the time.

28:37.262 --> 28:40.499
While I bathed you and
spoon fed you like an infant,

28:40.499 --> 28:42.434
I wiped your ass like an infant.

28:42.434 --> 28:48.340
While I shoveled graves
between unanswered prayers.

28:48.340 --> 28:50.208
You don't know what it
is to suffer.

28:50.208 --> 28:53.411
Emma did. She suffered her way
into the hole I dug her.

28:55.614 --> 28:57.249
Elizabeth knows it.

28:57.249 --> 28:59.417
Father in the ground, family
gone, stuck in this house

28:59.417 --> 29:01.453
like a dungeon.

29:01.453 --> 29:04.122
Can you fathom the strength
it took for that girl

29:04.122 --> 29:07.025
to smile again?

29:07.025 --> 29:08.894
If there is a line
forming for vengeance,

29:08.894 --> 29:11.263
you are at the back of it.

29:11.263 --> 29:13.598
But we've abandoned any
desire of vengeance.

29:13.598 --> 29:16.802
Even Jack, for you.

29:16.802 --> 29:20.372
I wonder if your pride
can withstand the sacrifice

29:20.372 --> 29:22.641
of showing us the same courtesy.

30:23.401 --> 30:24.936
Son of a bitch.

30:30.041 --> 30:31.309
Boy, come here.

31:17.450 --> 31:19.485
I don't hear anything.

31:19.485 --> 31:20.953
Supposed to hear
'em moving around.

31:20.953 --> 31:23.656
Not yet.
It'll be six months or more.

31:25.224 --> 31:27.059
You don't look pregnant.

31:27.059 --> 31:29.796
I will be in time, trust me...

31:29.796 --> 31:33.966
I'll be milk-cow fat
with cheeks like a beaver.

31:36.602 --> 31:39.639
Well, if I can't hear it,
and I can't feel it

31:39.639 --> 31:42.675
and you won't show for months,
how do you know?

31:42.675 --> 31:45.244
Men sure know how
to make babies

31:45.244 --> 31:47.113
but boy is that where
the knowledge stops.

31:50.216 --> 31:53.453
I missed my monthly visitor

31:53.453 --> 31:59.025
and then I was dizzy
and then I was nauseous.

31:59.025 --> 32:01.060
Do you need more proof?

32:01.060 --> 32:02.762
Well, is there more proof?

32:02.762 --> 32:04.564
Well, there is, but that's
all I'm going to share.

32:11.504 --> 32:13.172
Hey...

32:13.172 --> 32:14.474
That's the past.

32:15.842 --> 32:17.443
This is the future.

32:22.715 --> 32:24.183
We're a year away from
making another, Jack.

32:24.183 --> 32:26.118
Well, I was thinking this
is a pretty good

32:26.118 --> 32:28.321
opportunity to practice.

32:28.321 --> 32:30.990
- Practice?
- Mm-hmm.

32:30.990 --> 32:33.025
Practice is how
we got into this.

32:33.025 --> 32:36.162
Well, a year's a long time.
I'll forget everything.

32:36.162 --> 32:37.930
I mean...

32:37.930 --> 32:41.100
Look at it like this:
you can't get more pregnant.

32:42.301 --> 32:44.971
I can't believe that's
the line that sells me.

32:44.971 --> 32:46.906
'Cause you see
the logic in it.

32:50.910 --> 32:53.513
Or you're just so overcome with
desire you can't think straight.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.548
Hey!

32:55.548 --> 32:59.185
I touched a nerve
with that one.

32:59.185 --> 33:00.586
That's about to be
all you're touching.

33:00.586 --> 33:02.121
Yeah?

33:25.811 --> 33:28.614
Awful cold outside
to have that window open.

33:28.614 --> 33:30.550
Not in that room.

33:33.719 --> 33:35.254
Can't make two at once.

33:35.254 --> 33:38.024
Well, it seems they are
embracing the sport of it.

33:42.995 --> 33:44.764
We can hear ya!

33:56.642 --> 34:00.546
You saved my life.

34:00.546 --> 34:03.482
I know it.

34:03.482 --> 34:05.518
I did not need to be told.

34:06.652 --> 34:07.954
It's not vengeance .

34:10.256 --> 34:11.624
It's preservation.

34:14.427 --> 34:18.331
You've been to New York,
you've been to Boston.

34:18.331 --> 34:19.665
Um-hum.

34:19.665 --> 34:21.968
Now close your eyes
and imagine those places

34:21.968 --> 34:23.836
if the cities weren't there.

34:27.073 --> 34:28.708
Come on, do it.

34:33.179 --> 34:37.683
White sands stretching
to a forest of

34:37.683 --> 34:40.319
hickory and elm...

34:42.188 --> 34:45.124
taller than the buildings
that stand there now.

34:47.493 --> 34:51.263
Meadows filled with bison

34:51.263 --> 34:54.600
and moose and bear,

34:54.600 --> 34:58.204
and millions of salmon swimming
up the east river

34:58.204 --> 35:01.774
to spawn, so thick,
you could walk across them.

35:05.344 --> 35:08.714
Now think about
what's there now:

35:08.714 --> 35:14.320
a thirteen-mile island of cement

35:14.320 --> 35:16.789
with rivers of sewage
running underneath it

35:16.789 --> 35:21.794
until they dump into the bay
where salmon don't dare to swim.

35:21.794 --> 35:23.396
That's what they'll
do to this place:

35:24.697 --> 35:26.032
dam the rivers...

35:27.933 --> 35:29.969
flood the valleys...

35:29.969 --> 35:34.507
cut every tree that
stands to build cities.

35:34.507 --> 35:39.712
This paradise becomes
another concrete desert.

35:41.013 --> 35:42.782
I'm not going to kill him
for what they done to me,

35:42.782 --> 35:44.650
or what they done to John,

35:44.650 --> 35:45.918
or what they're
still doing to you.

35:49.088 --> 35:52.391
I'm going to kill them...

35:52.391 --> 35:54.393
because the men who build cities

35:54.393 --> 35:56.862
always send men
like Banner first.

36:01.467 --> 36:04.503
I do it for the child
of a child I will never meet.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.341
I do it for the land.

36:11.043 --> 36:13.079
I do it for you.

36:13.079 --> 36:15.981
So that when you're laid
to rest under the aspens...

36:17.483 --> 36:22.922
no one cuts them down
and builds a city over you.

36:24.657 --> 36:26.659
I know how much you've suffered.

36:26.659 --> 36:28.360
And I thank you for it.

36:30.162 --> 36:31.664
It's their turn now.

36:33.666 --> 36:35.568
God damn it,
it's their turn now.

37:32.725 --> 37:35.661
Spencer. Spencer.

37:38.464 --> 37:40.633
Do you see that?

37:40.633 --> 37:42.268
Is that the shore?

37:42.268 --> 37:43.435
It's a ship.

37:51.443 --> 37:52.678
See me.

37:56.615 --> 37:58.851
Come on, see me! Come on!

38:03.656 --> 38:07.359
Come on, see me! Come on!

38:09.562 --> 38:11.564
See me!

38:12.832 --> 38:14.266
See me!

38:35.354 --> 38:40.526
They see us?
They see us?

38:45.798 --> 38:48.300
Come on. Come on.

39:21.567 --> 39:22.968
Here we go.

39:29.508 --> 39:31.243
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

39:31.243 --> 39:33.279
I'd like to take you two
to a casino.

39:34.813 --> 39:35.881
All right, here we are.

39:42.221 --> 39:43.656
Just slide over here to me.

39:46.625 --> 39:48.327
Thank you.

39:48.327 --> 39:50.596
That's a shiny penny
that you have there, mate.

39:50.596 --> 39:52.464
You're lucky I don't whip
this skiff around

39:52.464 --> 39:54.066
with you still
standing on the hull.

39:54.066 --> 39:56.001
Don't forget how
I flagged down the ship.

39:56.001 --> 39:58.904
Teasing ya, mate.
Come on, then.

39:58.904 --> 40:00.839
Before the sea eats
the rest of this tug.

40:03.642 --> 40:04.843
All right, there you go.

40:33.099 --> 40:34.668
Could I have one of those?

40:43.276 --> 40:44.778
I suppose it's
unnecessary to point out

40:44.778 --> 40:46.813
how lucky
you are to be alive.

40:50.884 --> 40:52.486
You both
seem keenly aware.

40:55.355 --> 40:57.591
I doubt you were able
to retrieve the Captain's log,

40:57.591 --> 41:00.327
based on the condition
of your vessel.

41:00.327 --> 41:02.062
Captain's log was the
last thing on my mind.

41:03.029 --> 41:05.732
Yes, I suppose
it would have been.

41:09.936 --> 41:11.838
Our port of call
is Marseilles.

41:11.838 --> 41:13.507
What was your destination?

41:13.507 --> 41:15.175
Tug was headed to Suez.

41:17.110 --> 41:18.411
Beyond that, I don't know.

41:21.081 --> 41:23.750
Our final destination
is the United States.

41:23.750 --> 41:25.285
Quite the journey.

41:27.454 --> 41:30.824
You could book passage
from Marseilles.

41:30.824 --> 41:31.825
Where in the United States?

41:31.825 --> 41:32.959
Montana.

41:35.195 --> 41:36.863
Afraid I don't know it.

41:38.265 --> 41:41.001
It's in the mountains.

41:41.001 --> 41:43.336
In the middle of the country.

41:43.336 --> 41:47.107
Your journey is only beginning
when you get to port.

41:47.107 --> 41:49.809
You could say that.

41:49.809 --> 41:51.778
I'd recommend the Port
of Galveston

41:51.778 --> 41:53.980
or Port Arthur in the Gulf.

41:53.980 --> 41:57.617
Ellis Island
is a cesspool of disease.

41:57.617 --> 42:01.221
I hear it takes months for
an immigrant to gain entry.

42:04.157 --> 42:06.026
I was hoping that you
could help me with that.

42:07.460 --> 42:09.729
I have no dealings with
American immigration, sir.

42:11.464 --> 42:13.600
You are the captain
of this ship.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.135
I am.

42:15.135 --> 42:17.370
These are
international waters.

42:19.839 --> 42:20.907
They are.

42:23.610 --> 42:24.644
Marry us.

42:26.913 --> 42:30.483
Marriage to gain
citizenship is illegal, sir.

42:31.685 --> 42:33.553
It's a benefit.

42:38.325 --> 42:42.696
That's not why I'm doing it.

42:42.696 --> 42:43.930
No.

42:45.932 --> 42:47.400
No, I wouldn't think so.

42:52.072 --> 42:53.873
I'd be honored.

42:53.873 --> 42:55.041
I'll prepare the color guard.

42:56.443 --> 43:00.280
I'd like to do it now.
If you could.

43:00.280 --> 43:01.715
We can't make much
of a ceremony here,

43:01.715 --> 43:03.550
but we can make something.

43:03.550 --> 43:06.686
Putting things off
a day isn't proving conducive

43:06.686 --> 43:08.521
to our current lifestyle.

43:11.057 --> 43:13.393
No, I don't suppose it is.

43:16.830 --> 43:18.164
Very well.

43:22.602 --> 43:24.070
Don't suppose you have rings?

43:24.804 --> 43:26.239
No rings.

43:46.192 --> 43:48.361
When sailors pass
and we've no address

43:48.361 --> 43:51.498
to send belongings to their
widows, they accumulate here.

43:52.966 --> 43:55.402
See if you can find
some that fit.

43:55.402 --> 44:00.240
Rather morbid, getting
wed with a dead sailor's ring.

44:00.240 --> 44:02.409
Yes, I would endeavor
to replace at the first opportunity.

44:06.613 --> 44:07.614
I don't know.

44:11.384 --> 44:13.620
Ocean almost took us.

44:13.620 --> 44:14.754
Now it gives us rings.

44:19.125 --> 44:20.994
I think I'll keep mine.

44:32.539 --> 44:34.874
They're too big.

44:43.383 --> 44:44.417
Try this one.

44:48.388 --> 44:49.889
Belongs to my wife.

44:49.889 --> 44:51.524
I wear it when I'm on the sea.

44:53.693 --> 44:54.794
I'm certain she would approve.

45:19.285 --> 45:20.320
All right?

46:21.281 --> 46:22.715
Your quarters, sir.

46:33.426 --> 46:35.061
- Your essentials, my lady.
- Thank you.

46:35.061 --> 46:36.262
Enjoy your--

47:40.260 --> 47:42.262
Alex [whispering]:
You're very still.

47:46.366 --> 47:49.202
Odd how you can stay in
the exact same position,

47:49.202 --> 47:51.170
no fidgeting at all.

47:54.440 --> 47:56.075
You haven't moved in an hour.

47:58.778 --> 48:00.346
It's quite reptilian.

48:06.619 --> 48:08.288
Could be that I'm tired.

48:14.694 --> 48:16.429
I think our age difference
is showing when

48:16.429 --> 48:18.698
one good ravaging
has you knackered.

48:22.468 --> 48:23.770
Who says I'm older?

48:29.108 --> 48:31.110
Are you saying I look
as old as you?

48:34.380 --> 48:36.249
Have you seen a mirror lately?

48:43.089 --> 48:44.991
I should be exhausted as well.

48:44.991 --> 48:48.328
But alas...
I see no sleep for me tonight.

48:59.639 --> 49:00.640
Okay.

49:09.716 --> 49:11.617
Surely our wedding night
warrants celebration.

49:12.618 --> 49:16.255
Even from a curmudgeon like you.

49:16.255 --> 49:17.657
I don't know what that means.

49:17.657 --> 49:19.559
It is an insult, my love.

49:19.559 --> 49:22.161
Meant for my amusement.

49:22.161 --> 49:23.663
I know a better way
to entertain you.

49:25.665 --> 49:26.799
Get dressed.

49:33.373 --> 49:34.374
What are those lights?

49:40.380 --> 49:41.314
That's Egypt.

49:41.314 --> 49:42.949
That's the canal.

49:45.718 --> 49:48.221
London looks like
that at night.

49:48.221 --> 49:51.758
There's a cocoon of
light hugging the city.

49:54.494 --> 49:56.496
No light where we're going.

49:57.663 --> 49:59.165
Just moon and the stars.

50:00.666 --> 50:03.469
And whatever you burn
in the fireplace.

50:06.072 --> 50:08.608
- Why no lights?
- No electricity.

50:08.608 --> 50:11.244
I suppose you'll tell me
there's no plumbing next.

50:17.450 --> 50:19.552
There's no plumbing.

50:23.456 --> 50:25.058
Fascinating the things
men fail to mention

50:25.058 --> 50:26.692
when they're trying
to bed you.

50:31.731 --> 50:32.765
What's your dream?

50:35.368 --> 50:36.369
I don't dream.

50:39.539 --> 50:41.007
Everyone has a dream.

50:44.010 --> 50:46.446
I have plenty.

50:46.446 --> 50:48.147
I can take some
of yours, then.

50:48.147 --> 50:49.715
I mean it.
Tell me.

50:51.084 --> 50:52.385
You're my husband now.

50:54.120 --> 50:56.055
Sworn to tell me everything.

50:57.123 --> 50:58.658
I don't remember that vow.

50:58.658 --> 50:59.859
It's in there.

50:59.859 --> 51:02.228
Right between your vow
to honor and obey me.

51:02.228 --> 51:03.896
I think you got all that
shit backwards.

51:03.896 --> 51:05.131
You weren't listening.

51:05.131 --> 51:11.170
You must tell me everything,
honor me and obey me.

51:11.170 --> 51:14.407
You are at risk of breaking all
three vows on our wedding night,

51:14.407 --> 51:17.210
something else you didn't dare
mention prior to bedding me.

51:19.312 --> 51:21.013
I'll tell you one.

51:21.013 --> 51:22.448
I'll tell you a dream.

51:26.152 --> 51:27.920
In my heart I know
it was wrong to take you.

51:30.256 --> 51:32.191
And everything that happened
up to now was a sign.

51:33.860 --> 51:34.961
A warning.

51:38.197 --> 51:42.034
The elephant, the lions
the shipwreck.

51:45.738 --> 51:47.707
It was all the universe
telling me to put you back.

51:54.814 --> 51:57.016
I'm just too fucking
selfish to do it. So...

52:08.094 --> 52:10.763
My dream is...

52:11.764 --> 52:13.766
My dream is that
the universe is wrong.

52:15.601 --> 52:16.869
And you're mine to keep.

52:18.671 --> 52:22.008
The universe has
absolutely no say, whatsoever.

52:22.008 --> 52:24.377
I am following
you wherever you go.

52:24.377 --> 52:26.546
Whether you like
it or not.

52:26.546 --> 52:28.047
Choose another dream.

52:30.716 --> 52:32.051
This one's already come true.

52:34.420 --> 52:36.322
It's far from coming true.

52:41.794 --> 52:43.763
There is no putting me back.

52:48.301 --> 52:49.669
We are one now.

52:55.875 --> 52:59.612
When the sun hits your face
I am your shadow.

53:03.716 --> 53:06.085
When it finds my back
you are mine.

53:11.057 --> 53:12.792
I go where you go.

53:16.429 --> 53:18.331
Even if
it's the death of me.
