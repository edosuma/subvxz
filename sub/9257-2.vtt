00:29.738 --> 00:31.462
Sangre nuevo, homes.

00:44.851 --> 00:47.024
Police. Hold it right there.

00:47.158 --> 00:50.226
–Hands up. Against the car.
–Turn around.

00:50.359 --> 00:54.420
–I didn't do nothing, man.
–Buenos noches, muchachas.

00:56.411 --> 00:58.966
–Nice boa.
–Sí.

01:01.119 --> 01:03.542
New tags, new ink.

01:03.712 --> 01:05.949
What's up with that, Chapa?

01:06.114 --> 01:09.465
We're just changing brands.
Torrucos now.

01:09.635 --> 01:11.677
–Torrucos now?
–Simón.

01:11.813 --> 01:13.756
Armadillo's calling you guys?

01:21.131 --> 01:24.035
Armadillo's bro looks good
behind bars, huh?

01:36.501 --> 01:38.095
You tell him I called.

01:56.289 --> 01:59.427
Someone torched
Tio's drug crib.

01:59.461 --> 02:01.789
–What if our blow was in there?
–Then it's gone.

02:01.829 --> 02:04.190
Hey, we got a lot of
bread tied up in that shipment.

02:04.230 --> 02:06.592
You're so worried about your
goddamn money you don't get it.

02:06.632 --> 02:09.026
This could open up
an investigation into Tio's business.

02:09.067 --> 02:12.836
If we're not careful,
all roads are gonna lead back to us.

02:12.876 --> 02:14.597
Go find Tio.
I'll take care of this.

02:14.637 --> 02:19.208
–Let's just call Lem. I'll stay here and help.
–Did I ask for your help?

02:19.248 --> 02:20.972
–Hey.
–Morning, gentlemen.

02:21.202 --> 02:23.116
–Guess I missed the weenie roast.
–What happened?

02:23.156 --> 02:26.124
Arson. Started on the first floor.
Then the whole place went up.

02:26.164 --> 02:28.270
They were able
to determine that already?

02:28.310 --> 02:32.208
Whoever set the fire didn't try to
hide it. Gas can out back.

02:32.248 --> 02:34.360
–What brings you here?
–My case.

02:34.426 --> 02:37.365
We found the same graffiti
as the necklace tire executions.

02:37.405 --> 02:40.854
–Do we have a motive yet?
–That's not all we have.

02:42.559 --> 02:45.495
–Huh? Is that a kid?
–Not exactly.

02:50.308 --> 02:52.731
I'm shaking down
the new king cholo.

02:54.311 --> 02:57.505
Armadillo. I gave my card to
a few of his recruits.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.393
I guess they weren't kosher.

02:59.466 --> 03:04.229
Armadillo's my case. He raped a 12-year-old
girl last night to cover the tire murders.

03:04.269 --> 03:08.167
–He raped a kid?
Why isn't he in Central by now?
–Her brother's uncooperative.

03:08.207 --> 03:10.409
I think he took her
back to Mexico.

03:10.449 --> 03:12.622
No victim, no arrest.

03:12.754 --> 03:16.492
–Why would he burn this building?
–I spoke to some of the locals.

03:16.532 --> 03:19.895
It appears the owner
is a Theodore Osmond.

03:19.928 --> 03:23.096
He's selling more than
comic books. Drug dealer.

03:23.769 --> 03:27.123
Armadillo burns out his competition
and sends me a message.

03:27.163 --> 03:30.901
–Me and my boys'll handle this.
–Hey, I'm just giving you
information. This is my case.

03:30.941 --> 03:33.879
You see that little piggy
with my card spiked to its head?

03:33.919 --> 03:36.310
This is gangland…
my domain.

03:36.482 --> 03:39.772
–I'm already on it.
–Detective,
let me show you something.

03:39.812 --> 03:42.623
Any reason why the two of you
shouldn't pair up together?

03:42.663 --> 03:47.019
I just think it would make more sense
if I handled this on my own.

03:47.368 --> 03:50.947
You're gonna see some kind of kicking
and screaming you didn't know existed…

03:50.987 --> 03:53.380
you try pulling me off this.
–You both want it.

03:53.420 --> 03:56.166
It's big enough for the two of you.
Work it together.

03:56.206 --> 03:58.990
–Fine.
–Great.

04:20.125 --> 04:21.620
Whoa, hold.

04:21.790 --> 04:23.514
Maybe the doorbell works.

04:28.259 --> 04:30.140
–Armadillo.
–What's this about?

04:30.180 --> 04:31.970
It's all about love, ese.

04:33.542 --> 04:35.852
Come on, boys. Let's go for a walk.

04:35.911 --> 04:38.400
You heard him. Let's go.

04:42.635 --> 04:45.733
–Where were you…
–I was with some friends when the fire was set.

04:45.773 --> 04:47.979
I'll give you their names.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.682
You and your brother
are into a lot of things.

04:52.722 --> 04:56.781
–Pimping drugs, consolidating chulitos.
–No, I'm not like my brother.

04:56.821 --> 05:00.599
Navaro enjoys parties,
late nights.

05:00.633 --> 05:04.401
I'm much more comfortable in bed
with a good book to read.

05:04.441 --> 05:06.157
And a little girl to rape.

05:08.059 --> 05:12.382
I have no outstanding warrants.
My visas are in perfect order.

05:12.416 --> 05:15.289
There are no drugs, guns
or money in the house.

05:15.329 --> 05:18.138
If you're such a good boy
then you do as I say.

05:18.178 --> 05:22.006
Pack up your shit and get on the next
donkey back to home.

05:22.853 --> 05:26.565
No.
I just got here.

05:26.696 --> 05:29.480
I want to be
staying for a while, hmm?

05:32.267 --> 05:33.996
Fine.

05:34.029 --> 05:37.575
–Maybe you can stay at my house
for a little while.
–What's the charge?

05:37.615 --> 05:40.399
I'll think of something on the way.

05:40.592 --> 05:42.922
Anyone of you guys
not named Martinez?

05:42.962 --> 05:45.804
This guy Perez, his license expired
eight months ago. I'm calling it in.

05:45.844 --> 05:48.942
What's up with that, Xavier?
Lines too long at the DMV.?

05:48.982 --> 05:51.415
Yeah, okay. This guy Xavier, man.

05:51.449 --> 05:53.776
He's got an outstanding warrant
for aggravated assault.

05:53.816 --> 05:56.818
Oh. Now we got you
for harboring a felon.

06:00.125 --> 06:04.085
–For my wall, right next to your brother.
–Can I get a copy?

06:05.312 --> 06:08.571
This guy's got a notorious reputation,
but his rap sheet's squeaky clean.

06:08.611 --> 06:11.356
Unlike his brother, he's smart.
No mistakes so far.

06:11.396 --> 06:12.895
–Good morning.
–Oh, morning.

06:12.935 --> 06:16.608
Have you met our civilian auditor?
Claudette Wyms. Lanie Kellis.

06:16.648 --> 06:18.372
–Hello.
–Hi. Another one?

06:18.569 --> 06:22.243
Yeah. The brother of that Mexican
national. If anything, he's worse.

06:22.283 --> 06:25.741
Wow. Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

06:25.775 --> 06:28.102
Oh, well, not at all.
I was just saying that…

06:28.142 --> 06:31.817
unless we get this guy on something else,
the harboring charges won't hold him.

06:31.857 --> 06:33.680
I know. So does he.

06:33.906 --> 06:36.172
We have to find the guy who set
the fire, connect it to Armadillo…

06:36.212 --> 06:37.994
then get him for the arson.

06:38.133 --> 06:40.503
I want him
for more than that.

06:40.536 --> 06:44.913
We'll start with the shop owner.
You know where I can find him?

06:45.498 --> 06:48.187
–No.
–Really?

06:48.221 --> 06:53.765
'Cause it says Theodore Osmond is registered
as one of your confidential informants.

06:55.648 --> 06:58.819
Oh, Tio.
I haven't seen him in months.

06:58.852 --> 07:02.782
Theodore Osmond? That's his real name?

07:03.172 --> 07:05.214
I'll get the word out.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.258
–Meantime, I'll have my guys
hunt down the firebug.
–Good.

07:08.298 --> 07:11.106
I'd like to observe
Detective Mackey on this.

07:11.146 --> 07:14.949
–Sure. Give us a chance to talk.
–Actually, I was just coming to get you.

07:14.989 --> 07:17.383
–A city official has just been shot.
–Who?

07:17.423 --> 07:20.712
I don't have all the details, but I'm sure
your people will want you down there.

07:20.752 --> 07:24.595
–Dutch, you've met Lanie Kellis?
–Of course.

07:24.628 --> 07:27.437
We've got a city official
shot at Benton and Hollis.

07:27.477 --> 07:29.454
I need you
down there right away.

07:29.494 --> 07:32.398
–Lanie's gonna ride along.
–Great.

07:32.536 --> 07:35.025
About you,
not the city official.

07:35.226 --> 07:37.235
–Do we know who the victim is?
–Uh, not yet.

07:37.275 --> 07:39.643
–Okay. You ready? Let's go.
–Uh, I—

07:39.804 --> 07:41.529
I guess so.

07:46.241 --> 07:48.698
You have a connection with the drug
dealer whose place just got burnt down?

07:48.738 --> 07:51.194
–Yeah.
–Jesus Christ.

07:51.363 --> 07:54.911
I asked you if there was any reason
not to bring Claudette into this.

07:54.951 --> 07:57.568
Hey, you're the politician. Learn
to read between the goddamn lines.

07:57.608 --> 08:00.776
I told you I wanted
to handle this thing myself.

08:01.162 --> 08:02.944
What does this mean for us?

08:04.588 --> 08:07.722
It just means
I'll have to be careful.

08:07.887 --> 08:12.297
Tio's laying low at his kid's
mom's place. He's spooked.

08:14.034 --> 08:17.100
–How long you freezing us out?
–Until I can trust the three of you again.

08:17.140 --> 08:19.279
–Look, I'm really sorry, boss.
–Me too.

08:19.319 --> 08:22.735
–We made a mistake.
–Yeah, you did.

08:23.064 --> 08:27.354
I need one of you to come with me.
I don't give a damn which one.

08:31.902 --> 08:34.686
–You wanna go higher?
–No. No higher.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.183
Okay.

08:37.345 --> 08:40.063
All right. Come on.

08:40.259 --> 08:42.464
Go inside
with your mom, baby.

08:42.596 --> 08:44.899
Beautiful kid.

08:45.062 --> 08:47.005
Hi. You okay?

08:47.143 --> 08:49.064
No.

08:49.098 --> 08:52.771
–A Mexican psycho torched
my goddamn building.
–Yeah, we saw.

08:52.811 --> 08:53.867
What'd you lose?

08:53.901 --> 08:56.613
I got lucky. Most of the product
was cut, bagged, and out.

08:56.653 --> 08:58.374
I had some cash and
my records in the safe.

08:58.414 --> 09:00.554
–What safe?
–What records?

09:00.720 --> 09:03.978
–Accounts ledger…
income, expenses, you know.
–No, I don't know.

09:04.018 --> 09:06.028
I'm running a business. I gotta know
what's coming in and going out.

09:06.068 --> 09:09.966
Going out? Like payments to me?
My name is in that goddamn ledger?

09:10.006 --> 09:12.400
It's in code, man.
I call you “Landlord.”

09:12.440 --> 09:15.185
Hey, you and your boys didn't have
a problem with the way I do business…

09:15.225 --> 09:17.778
when I damn near doubled your cut.
–Where's the safe?

09:17.818 --> 09:20.694
Back room of the shop.
One of those corporate espionage deals.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.518
You try to force it open,
it destroys the contents.

09:22.558 --> 09:26.914
–All right, all right. I'll get the safe.
–And I'll get Armadillo.

09:28.258 --> 09:31.003
–I want you to stay here and lay low.
–This can't go unanswered.

09:31.043 --> 09:33.757
It won't. I need a couple
of your guys, names and numbers.

09:33.797 --> 09:36.220
Guys that know
how to use a Zippo.

09:38.216 --> 09:41.026
–Find out where the Torrucos are hanging.
–Want us to roust them?

09:41.066 --> 09:44.612
No. Give them this address.
Tell them to burn it on my signal.

09:44.652 --> 09:49.095
And just the building. No bodies.
I wanna send a message, not start a war.

09:49.135 --> 09:51.115
You think you can handle that?

09:52.913 --> 09:56.428
–It's locked.
–Have Lem pick you up.

09:59.670 --> 10:03.152
Need to use my phone?

10:11.293 --> 10:13.334
It's pretty quiet
for the shooting of a city official.

10:13.374 --> 10:16.792
I figured there'd be some news crews,
at least one of the independents.

10:16.832 --> 10:19.420
Ray, what do we know?

10:19.586 --> 10:23.100
The victim was Helen Zamorski.
Shot three times in the back.

10:23.140 --> 10:24.930
No witnesses. No weapon.

10:25.190 --> 10:27.071
–Took her to Mission Cross.
–Helen Zamorski.

10:27.111 --> 10:28.901
–Who is she?
–P.E.O.

10:29.097 --> 10:33.191
–P.E.O.?
–Parking enforcement officer.

10:33.419 --> 10:37.478
–A meter maid? You gotta be shitting me.
–This is her machine right here.

10:37.518 --> 10:39.242
This is our city official?

10:41.392 --> 10:45.006
Will you get your captain
on the phone for me, please?

10:55.481 --> 10:58.582
Hey. Got a call from
the fire inspector.

10:58.715 --> 11:00.980
The safe was in
the back of the shop.

11:01.020 --> 11:03.191
Cocaine residue and scales
were found upstairs.

11:03.231 --> 11:07.801
–That will give us probable cause
for the search and seizure.
–Nice work.

11:07.841 --> 11:11.537
–Can't wait to see what's inside.
–That makes two of us.

11:11.556 --> 11:14.813
–What do we have?
–The building's owner was definitely peddling.

11:14.853 --> 11:16.896
He's M.I.A,
but we found his safe.

11:16.936 --> 11:19.969
Maybe there's something inside
to tie Armadillo to him.

11:20.009 --> 11:22.530
Tio's no saint,
but he's the victim here.

11:22.570 --> 11:25.702
We have to go after Armadillo.
Get whoever set that fire to roll on him.

11:25.742 --> 11:29.636
I know Tio's your C.I.,
but Armadillo hit him for a reason.

11:29.870 --> 11:31.752
Motive's a pretty good
starting point.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.673
I'll get a warrant
to open the safe.

11:33.713 --> 11:35.723
–I got a guy who can crack that.
–Great.

11:35.763 --> 11:38.997
–Any luck finding Tio?
–We got a couple of leads.

11:45.177 --> 11:48.539
–What do you got?
–An address in Colorado Springs.

11:48.572 --> 11:53.757
–Where?
–She's staying with a Camille Briskin.

11:53.822 --> 11:57.518
–Some chick she went to college with.
–My kids with her?

11:57.697 --> 11:59.803
–I'm on the next flight.
–Uh…

11:59.938 --> 12:02.241
I just talked to my guy there.

12:02.372 --> 12:05.276
–She's packing up to go someplace.
–Packing?

12:05.317 --> 12:08.289
–Did this guy spook her?
–No, look. I trust him.

12:08.329 --> 12:10.657
Let him stay on her.
Look, you go there now…

12:10.697 --> 12:12.834
she's liable to be someplace
else by the time you land.

12:12.874 --> 12:14.986
Let's just see how it plays out.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.794
All right.

12:20.655 --> 12:23.177
–My mom's the one that called.
–Yeah? Is your mom around?

12:23.217 --> 12:25.612
–Yeah.
–Ma'am, are you the one that called us?

12:25.652 --> 12:27.852
–About apartment two.
–What's the problem?

12:27.892 --> 12:30.796
–There's a terrorist in there.
–Terrorist?

12:30.934 --> 12:34.768
–Tell them about the smells.
–Chemicals, like he's makin'
dirty bombs or something.

12:34.808 --> 12:38.039
My babies sleep
on the other side of that wall.

12:38.203 --> 12:41.685
Look. I'm trying to raise
two boys by myself.

12:41.885 --> 12:44.951
–Now I gotta deal with these people?
–Okay. Fine. We'll check it out.

12:44.991 --> 12:46.716
I should come with you.

12:46.912 --> 12:49.420
No, ma'am.
You should stay right here.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.765
–Mr Al-Thani?
–Zayed, yes.

13:01.962 --> 13:04.708
Zayed, I'm Officer Sofer.
This is Officer Lowe.

13:04.748 --> 13:07.335
–Yes?
–We've received a complaint.

13:07.533 --> 13:09.551
A complaint?
About me?

13:09.584 --> 13:13.514
It's her. She told you I was
a terrorist, didn't she?

13:14.033 --> 13:18.444
–Sir, if we could just come in…
–I did nothing wrong. You people
pick on me for no reason.

13:18.484 --> 13:21.582
–Okay. Just let us come in,
take a quick look around.
–So.

13:21.622 --> 13:24.755
I am a suspect
just because I am Arab?

13:24.889 --> 13:28.018
No, sir. You're a suspect because 19 guys
who look like your twin brother…

13:28.058 --> 13:30.231
killed 3·000 Americans.

13:33.053 --> 13:37.337
Look, the easiest way for us to handle this is
just let us come in, take a look around.

13:37.377 --> 13:42.591
Or we can file a report with the federal
government and let them check you out.

13:45.573 --> 13:49.438
–God bless America.
–After you, sir.

13:55.788 --> 13:57.829
My brother sends it
to me from home.

13:57.869 --> 14:01.188
–I cannot control what they print.
–Where's home?

14:01.392 --> 14:04.426
–Damascus.
–How long have you been in this country?

14:04.466 --> 14:06.802
Five years.
I have a job.

14:06.963 --> 14:09.266
I pay taxes.

14:09.429 --> 14:12.148
My wife.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.595
–What you making?
–Pickled fish.

14:26.079 --> 14:28.022
Mmm.

14:30.338 --> 14:32.699
Well, thank you.
We appreciate your cooperation.

14:32.739 --> 14:36.303
So you will tell the black one
that I am no terrorist?

14:36.358 --> 14:38.181
We'll tell her.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.955
I found out where
Armadillo's boys are working from.

14:41.995 --> 14:46.116
The old Sugar Cube Lounge on Juniper.
Salsa by night, distribution by day.

14:46.156 --> 14:48.462
I doubt they have permits.

14:48.496 --> 14:52.264
Go in. Tell them you're
with Alcohol Control. Close it down.

14:52.304 --> 14:55.146
Have Tio's boys light it up
once it's all clear.

14:55.186 --> 14:58.158
Hey, Vic. We got a positive I.D
on Armadillo's fire starter.

14:58.198 --> 15:01.960
–Ripley Verdugo. He's, uh, flame retarded.
–Bring him in.

15:05.912 --> 15:09.075
Hey, Vic. Shane told me
about your family splittin'.

15:09.115 --> 15:11.123
I'm really sorry, man.

15:14.078 --> 15:16.087
Are you an idiot?

15:17.408 --> 15:19.769
–Smith, you old drunk.
–Mackey, you bald bastard.

15:19.809 --> 15:22.205
–What are you doing?
–Same old. You look good, man.

15:22.245 --> 15:25.949
–How's the brood?
–They're good. So Shane
brought you up to speed?

15:25.989 --> 15:27.935
Yeah. You need me
to open some safe?

15:27.975 --> 15:30.817
Right. Only I need you
to go through the front lock.

15:30.857 --> 15:33.218
The boys said it's a smart safe.
By going through the lock…

15:33.258 --> 15:36.756
it'll trigger the acid
and destroy whatever's inside.

15:37.677 --> 15:39.817
Oh. I get it.

15:41.039 --> 15:43.283
Oh, Smith.
This is Detective Wyms.

15:43.440 --> 15:47.334
–Smith the locksmith? That's convenient.
–Yeah, I get that.

15:50.069 --> 15:54.293
–Looks like the Omni 600 series.
–Actually, it's the 700 series.

15:54.391 --> 15:56.116
Right.

16:01.596 --> 16:07.800
Hold on. The manufacturer said
you gotta go through the back to
disarm the destruct mechanism.

16:09.858 --> 16:14.300
What the hell's going on, man? I thought
you'd worked on these things before.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.578
Yeah, sorry.

16:16.741 --> 16:20.005
I'll go through the back.

16:20.168 --> 16:21.893
–Good catch.
–Yeah.

16:24.395 --> 16:27.268
It would take more than a few bullets
to bring down Officer Zamorski.

16:27.308 --> 16:29.702
Officer Zamorski?
She's a meter maid.

16:29.742 --> 16:32.165
We're all officers here.

16:32.336 --> 16:34.185
You know how much revenue
we bring in for this city?

16:34.225 --> 16:37.515
If it wasn't for people like Helen
Zamorski risking her life every day…

16:37.555 --> 16:40.173
you guys would be making
less than schoolteachers.

16:40.213 --> 16:42.036
And we appreciate it.

16:42.230 --> 16:44.151
This is awful.

16:44.185 --> 16:47.219
Helen writes 30% above
her quota every month.

16:47.641 --> 16:51.252
–Helen's electronic ticket book
was smashed to pieces.
–Animals.

16:51.292 --> 16:54.076
–Restroom?
–Yeah, it's in the back.

16:54.142 --> 16:56.632
I'd like to see who she
wrote tickets for today…

16:56.672 --> 16:58.680
specifically the last ticket
she wrote before she was shot.

16:58.720 --> 17:03.004
I'd also like names of
people she's written large
numbers of tickets to over the last year.

17:03.044 --> 17:04.637
I'll print them out.

17:04.868 --> 17:07.521
Hey, uh…

17:07.751 --> 17:11.396
who can I talk to
about a parking snafu?

17:11.625 --> 17:16.843
–I got this $63 ticket.
–Ah, “No Parking 4:00 to 7:00.”

17:16.972 --> 17:19.526
Right. Yeah.
In front of the courthouse.

17:19.566 --> 17:23.271
See, I was on the job.
I was testifying in a kiddie porn case.

17:23.311 --> 17:28.018
We got the sick bastard, thank God.
But anyway, I got this ticket.

17:28.211 --> 17:30.893
Aren't the police provided
parking off of Grand Avenue?

17:30.933 --> 17:33.294
Yeah, but that's like
six blocks away.

17:33.334 --> 17:36.913
I was running late for this, uh,
child pornography case.

17:36.953 --> 17:40.435
Well, I guess you're gonna
have to challenge it in court.

17:40.475 --> 17:45.716
Come on, a little help maybe.
One officer to another.

17:46.239 --> 17:48.728
I don't fix parking tickets, sir.

17:50.081 --> 17:53.975
And being a police officer
doesn't place you above the law.

17:58.663 --> 18:02.081
–All set?
–Mm-hmm.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.771
–This guy was quite the bookkeeper.
–Oh, yeah?

18:04.811 --> 18:06.535
What's he got in there?

18:06.603 --> 18:10.086
Nothing about Armadillo,
but look at this.

18:10.414 --> 18:14.185
He was making monthly payments
to a landlord when he owns the building.

18:14.225 --> 18:18.061
Well, maybe Armadillo's the landlord.
Tio got tired of shelling out.

18:18.101 --> 18:21.665
–Fire was the payback.
–Black dealer, Latino boss man?

18:21.718 --> 18:27.088
I doubt it. Besides, he was making payments
weeks before Armadillo crossed the border.

18:27.128 --> 18:29.399
Oh.

18:29.530 --> 18:32.276
Maybe this is the guy
Armadillo's trying to squeeze out.

18:32.316 --> 18:34.039
–Your boys find Tio?
–Yeah.

18:34.079 --> 18:37.048
–Well, good. Let's bring him in.
–It's not that easy.

18:37.088 --> 18:38.877
Sure it is. Come on.

18:45.765 --> 18:47.646
–I'll bring him out.
–I'll come with.

18:47.686 --> 18:51.522
Uh… He's my C.I I just bring
a stranger in there, it'll blow the trust.

18:51.562 --> 18:55.075
You said you hadn't seen him in months. You
don't know how squirrelly this guy might be.

18:55.115 --> 18:57.348
–You're not going in there without backup.
–Look.

18:57.388 --> 18:59.622
Tio's still valuable
to me, all right?

18:59.662 --> 19:01.485
Now wait here.

19:01.679 --> 19:03.279
I'll handle this.

19:03.313 --> 19:06.186
Something I should know
about you and this guy?

19:06.226 --> 19:09.610
No. I'll be right out.

19:14.775 --> 19:17.201
If you come in voluntarily, it'll look
like you've got nothing to hide.

19:17.241 --> 19:22.068
–You gonna watch my back, right?
–Yeah. And you're gonna watch
mine. She wants Armadillo.

19:22.108 --> 19:27.190
–Thinks grillin'you about the
landlord will lead to him.
–What do I tell her?

19:27.551 --> 19:30.586
You're just another local shop owner
forced to pay protection money.

19:30.626 --> 19:32.507
Choose your favorite
band of brothers.

19:32.547 --> 19:35.133
–One-niners, The Monks, Jack-uzis, got it?
–Yeah, I'm good.

19:35.173 --> 19:38.109
Yeah, so is Wyms.
You be careful.

19:38.246 --> 19:41.216
I'm trying to lead her
down a different path.

19:43.114 --> 19:45.226
Here's the guy you're gonna I.D.

19:46.444 --> 19:49.544
I'm pretty sure
he's the firebug.

19:49.678 --> 19:52.680
Now, you tell us that you saw him casing
the building last night before you left.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.402
No problem. What are we doing
about hitting Armadillo?

19:55.442 --> 19:57.771
We found out
where the Torrucos hang.

19:57.811 --> 20:01.934
Your little friends are gonna rip
a three-alarmer through it tonight.

20:01.974 --> 20:03.535
Vic.

20:03.735 --> 20:07.185
–You get the plan?
–Yeah, I'm good.

20:09.851 --> 20:12.219
Everything okay in here?

20:12.380 --> 20:15.065
Sure. Everything's fine.

20:20.930 --> 20:25.220
This is a list of your property.
I want you to take a look at it.

20:25.989 --> 20:28.382
That the bitch
that burned my place up?

20:28.422 --> 20:31.173
You're here to tell us
what you know.

20:32.233 --> 20:34.466
–Hey, Vic.
–I'm in the middle of something.

20:34.506 --> 20:36.874
–It's important.
–Give me a minute.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.760
I'll start without you.

20:41.230 --> 20:45.001
–What's up?
–My guy. Followed Corrine
to the Colorado Springs airport.

20:45.041 --> 20:48.043
Airport? Where's she going?

20:50.068 --> 20:51.792
Come on.

20:51.989 --> 20:53.710
Where the hell
is she going?

20:53.750 --> 20:55.631
–Who does she know in Phoenix?
–Phoenix?

20:55.671 --> 20:58.513
–Mm-hmm.
–No clue. That's what
I'm paying you to find out.

20:58.553 --> 21:01.686
–And I'm trying, Vic.
–Are the kids with her?

21:02.043 --> 21:03.924
Just the baby. Cassidy and Matthew
are still with the friend.

21:03.964 --> 21:05.686
And I got another guy
waiting for her on that end.

21:05.726 --> 21:08.411
Phoenix?

21:08.608 --> 21:13.243
–Look, I gotta go. Call me
as soon as you know something.
–All right. I will.

21:13.283 --> 21:15.725
–What did I miss?
–Tio found our guy.

21:15.844 --> 21:18.046
This is the dude. Couldn't
miss that inked baldhead.

21:18.086 --> 21:20.031
Saw him hangin' out
in the back lot when I was leavin'.

21:20.071 --> 21:24.823
–Ripley Verdugo. Seven priors, three for arson.
–Consider him picked up.

21:29.069 --> 21:32.359
–You coming with?
–No, you go ahead and pick up the suspect.

21:32.399 --> 21:35.303
I'm gonna have
a little talk with Tio.

21:40.404 --> 21:44.563
Juice? Soda? A new distribution crib?

21:45.015 --> 21:47.252
–I'm here to help, lady.
–Good.

21:47.417 --> 21:49.906
Let's talk about
your record keeping.

21:49.978 --> 21:54.072
There are some pretty
interesting things in this ledger.

21:54.333 --> 21:56.566
I'll tell you what.
I've never seen Vic this pissed.

21:56.606 --> 21:59.162
He's pissed about his kids.
It's classic displacement, man.

21:59.202 --> 22:02.170
–It's classic replacement I'm worried about.
–Think he'll boot us?

22:02.210 --> 22:03.934
Gimme a break.

22:04.099 --> 22:06.012
–What would Vic be without us?
–Maybe we'll find out.

22:06.052 --> 22:07.933
I'm not going back to Traffic.

22:07.973 --> 22:09.921
Let's just do our jobs,
and do it well.

22:09.961 --> 22:12.321
Oh, so now that plan
makes sense to you?

22:12.361 --> 22:14.751
–Shut up.
–No, you shut up.
–Damn!

22:16.235 --> 22:17.959
Put on a shirt, bitch.

22:29.875 --> 22:32.653
Racked up quite
the parking portfolio, Barney.

22:32.693 --> 22:36.590
–Thirteen hundred
and eighty-six dollars. Wow.
–Uh, yeah.

22:36.728 --> 22:40.146
I get a lot on the job.
I lose track.

22:40.315 --> 22:43.546
–What is your job?
–I'm a messenger.

22:43.740 --> 22:48.021
–I gotta pay for any tickets I get.
–You got another one today.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.528
Oh, yeah. So?

22:50.689 --> 22:53.627
So the woman who wrote that ticket
was shot three times this morning.

22:53.667 --> 22:56.060
She's gonna live,
but not like she used to.

22:56.100 --> 23:00.447
–I'm sorry to hear that.
–She wrote you 34 tickets
in the last seven months.

23:00.487 --> 23:03.777
–Maybe you're a little upset about that.
–Uh, yeah.

23:03.817 --> 23:07.715
Yeah, I'm upset.
I don't have 1·300 bucks.

23:07.820 --> 23:11.270
And I could lose my job.

23:11.470 --> 23:13.194
But I didn't shoot her.

23:13.391 --> 23:15.694
Where were you at 9:30?

23:16.881 --> 23:20.528
I was, uh, in traffic
on my way to L.A.X.

23:20.724 --> 23:24.021
–You fired a gun today, Barney?
–Of course not.

23:24.182 --> 23:27.829
–You willing to take a G.S.R.?
–What is that?

23:28.025 --> 23:31.194
Gunshot Residue Test.
Standard government test.

23:31.228 --> 23:33.652
It detects whether you've
fired a gun recently.

23:33.692 --> 23:35.799
Oh, yeah, sure.
If it'll help.

23:37.791 --> 23:42.234
How does a novice comic book
merchant buy two buildings, cash?

23:42.434 --> 23:44.603
Man, I can barely
cover my mortgage.

23:44.643 --> 23:47.809
I'm smart with money.

23:47.973 --> 23:51.840
If you're smart, how come you're
making payments to a landlord
when you don't have one?

23:51.880 --> 23:55.460
Being a C.I isn't
a “get out of jail free” card.

23:55.690 --> 23:57.732
We found scales
and drug residue above your shop.

23:57.772 --> 24:02.150
–I know you're dealing.
–Reality check.

24:04.274 --> 24:07.082
My building getting smoked
makes me a victim.

24:07.122 --> 24:10.606
I can get that stack of cash in the safe
and the dollar amounts in this ledger…

24:10.646 --> 24:14.382
and have search warrants
for your home and other building.

24:14.422 --> 24:17.524
What we find there
gonna make you a victim too?

24:19.162 --> 24:21.814
Can I help you somehow?

24:22.075 --> 24:26.038
Help me get
Armadillo, and I ignore this ledger.

24:26.109 --> 24:30.297
That's Tio? He's the guy the Long Beach
sheriffs pulled over with your team.

24:30.337 --> 24:33.535
Right.

24:33.763 --> 24:36.636
–What else haven't you told me?
–Be quiet. I'm trying to listen.

24:36.676 --> 24:39.390
How deep is your
relationship with this guy?

24:39.430 --> 24:41.766
Deep enough.

24:45.418 --> 24:47.590
–Can he hurt us?
–He won't.

24:47.724 --> 24:49.902
–He can't or he won't?
–He won't.

24:49.997 --> 24:54.026
We had a deal. You said
you were gonna clean up your act.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.332
I'm in control.

24:56.465 --> 24:58.380
I've got a watchdog in my house,
and now one of my best detectives…

24:58.420 --> 25:01.852
is grilling the guy who can
blow the whistle on you.

25:02.901 --> 25:06.034
Hey, how's she doing?

25:06.167 --> 25:07.892
Aren't you working a case?

25:08.089 --> 25:12.313
I got half an hour before
my next evil parking suspect shows up.

25:16.382 --> 25:20.249
–We gotta stop this.
–Yeah, and we gotta be careful
the way we play Claudette.

25:20.289 --> 25:22.461
Come on, greaseball.
Let's go.

25:24.451 --> 25:26.175
Beauty.

25:32.392 --> 25:36.999
–Firebug's here. Wanted to
give you the first crack at him.
–Thanks.

25:37.580 --> 25:39.304
Let Tio stew.

25:39.501 --> 25:41.613
I haven't finished with him yet.

25:41.678 --> 25:44.550
Sure.

25:44.688 --> 25:47.056
Look at my prayer mat.

25:47.217 --> 25:49.835
I hang it here to dry.
And she had her dog rip it to pieces.

25:49.875 --> 25:53.101
Anyone could have done that. If it's
so sacred, you shouldn't leave it out.

25:53.141 --> 25:55.406
Somebody needs to put
that animal to sleep.

25:55.446 --> 25:58.257
Is that what you're doing in there?
Cookin'up gas to put us all to sleep?

25:58.297 --> 26:00.502
That's enough!

26:00.666 --> 26:03.798
Look, you had us search his place,
and we did. He's not a terrorist.

26:03.838 --> 26:07.126
Go back inside and restrain that dog
before I call animal control.

26:07.166 --> 26:10.730
And you, stop egging her on.
Stop threatening her dog.

26:10.912 --> 26:12.793
And stop acting
like such a victim.

26:12.833 --> 26:15.836
Both of you go inside
and stay inside your own apartments.

26:15.876 --> 26:18.976
You do not want us
coming back here again.

26:27.371 --> 26:30.570
–You're learning.
–Good teacher.

26:33.327 --> 26:35.785
Wanna tell me where you were
last night, Ripley?

26:35.825 --> 26:37.549
I was home.

26:37.649 --> 26:41.296
Jerkin' off into a sock.
You wanna see the evidence?

26:41.588 --> 26:44.656
Have some manners
when you talk to me.

26:48.536 --> 26:51.058
How long since you
looked like that?

26:51.258 --> 26:54.228
The shaved head thing went out
like six months ago. Why?

26:54.268 --> 26:57.532
–Jesus, I can't catch a goddamn break.
–What now?

26:57.694 --> 26:59.936
–Tio I.D'd a bald guy.
–Vic!

26:59.970 --> 27:02.874
–Yeah?
–You care to tell me how our eyewitness Tio…

27:02.914 --> 27:06.236
identified a thug from a year-old
police mug shot that only you and I had?

27:06.276 --> 27:08.157
No clue, but I'm gonna
help you find out.

27:08.197 --> 27:11.391
It's okay. You've done enough.
I'll get to the bottom of this.

27:11.431 --> 27:14.782
You identified the right guy,
but the wrong hair.

27:15.113 --> 27:17.449
Wrong hair? That's weird.

27:17.611 --> 27:22.627
Now, you're gonna tell me why you lied
and who you're protecting, right now!

27:23.567 --> 27:26.897
Tio will hold up.
He knows the drill.

27:26.930 --> 27:30.296
You wanna put both our careers
in this guy's hands?

27:39.193 --> 27:41.463
Why'd she do that?

27:45.244 --> 27:47.574
Who are you paying
protection money to?

27:47.614 --> 27:50.071
I saw who I saw.

27:55.427 --> 27:58.146
What's your
connection to Mackey?

27:59.526 --> 28:01.159
I'm just a C.I.

28:01.193 --> 28:04.609
I tie that payout to a cop,
and I'll get you for racketeering.

28:04.649 --> 28:06.498
You hitch that to the intent
to distribute charge…

28:06.538 --> 28:09.413
and you won't see your
baby girl until she's 35.

28:09.453 --> 28:12.618
–Now talk to me!
–Claudette, you got a second?

28:12.974 --> 28:15.659
–Now?
–Yes.

28:17.297 --> 28:19.179
A club on Juniper
just went up in flames.

28:19.219 --> 28:22.540
F.D says it looks like the same
arson M.O as the comic book store.

28:22.580 --> 28:25.135
–I want you down there.
–I'm in the middle of this.

28:25.175 --> 28:29.809
–Questioning a witness can wait.
–He could be the key to getting Armadillo.

28:29.849 --> 28:34.601
An hour ago it was your mandate.
Now you've got me chasing fire engines?

28:34.748 --> 28:37.526
I have a civilian auditor
evaluating my every move.

28:37.566 --> 28:41.017
You're the primary detective on
this case. I need you on scene.

28:41.057 --> 28:44.190
–This isn't a discussion.
–What is it exactly?

28:47.652 --> 28:50.911
The cop said this was about
that parking lady that was shot today?

28:50.951 --> 28:54.624
That's right, Izzy. And the last ticket
she wrote before that happened was to you.

28:54.664 --> 28:56.866
Which means you're either
a witness or a suspect.

28:56.906 --> 28:59.590
–Take a seat.
–Well, I didn't see anything.

28:59.630 --> 29:02.309
–I guess that makes you a suspect.
–A suspect?

29:02.349 --> 29:05.224
Look, I take the tickets
'cause it's cheaper than the garage.

29:05.264 --> 29:09.838
–Cheaper?
–The parking structure is 22 bucks for the day.

29:10.034 --> 29:13.845
I usually get two,
maybe three $30 tickets a week.

29:13.879 --> 29:16.978
110 versus 90.
I'm saving 20 taking the fines.

29:17.335 --> 29:19.377
So you knew you were
gonna get the ticket?

29:19.417 --> 29:22.995
–It's part of doing business.
–Are you willing to take
a Gunshot Residue Test?

29:23.035 --> 29:26.582
–Will it cost me anything?
–Only if you're lying.

29:31.809 --> 29:34.140
–Burn this. No more bookkeeping.
–Understood.

29:34.180 --> 29:37.596
You're out of here. Lay low.

29:37.956 --> 29:41.246
–Yeah?
–Corrine caught a connecting flight
in Phoenix.

29:41.286 --> 29:43.232
She's due in Burbank
in 40 minutes.

29:43.272 --> 29:46.049
–She's coming here? I should go…
–Let me tail her.

29:46.089 --> 29:48.804
See what she's planning.
Be ready for my call.

29:48.844 --> 29:51.081
Okay.

29:54.927 --> 29:58.923
A high-level city official.

29:59.058 --> 30:01.900
I know. I'm sorry. I didn't have a chance
to return your call.

30:01.940 --> 30:06.929
Is there some reason you didn't want me
following Detective Mackey today?

30:07.159 --> 30:10.511
–Of course not.
–Excuse me.

30:11.930 --> 30:14.324
It was arson.
But it was Torruco base.

30:14.364 --> 30:18.195
–Someone trying to pay back Armadillo.
–That was fast.

30:18.335 --> 30:20.216
I'll see if Tio knows anything.

30:20.256 --> 30:22.461
–We cut him loose.
–What?

30:22.593 --> 30:25.338
Didn't have enough to hold him.
We had to release him and his property.

30:25.378 --> 30:28.064
–The ledger?
–Yes.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.084
What ledger?

30:35.209 --> 30:36.966
Nothing important.

30:40.492 --> 30:43.990
Three shots. The victim's book
was smashed to pieces.

30:44.143 --> 30:47.505
–This was a rage crime. Try this.
–Nope.

30:47.539 --> 30:50.971
–Mr Thrifty knew he was getting the ticket.
–Mm-hmm.

30:51.059 --> 30:53.679
–Mmm, it's homemade. Try it.
–Yeah?

30:53.877 --> 30:55.694
Barney's just way too passive.

30:55.734 --> 30:59.601
–Plus, they both willingly agreed to a G.S.R.
–So what are you gonna do now?

30:59.641 --> 31:02.004
I'll take a look at other
crimes in the area this morning.

31:02.044 --> 31:05.717
Make sure somebody wasn't trying
to avoid being put at the wrong
place at the right time.

31:05.757 --> 31:10.167
–G.S.R results came back
on Barney Plotkin. Positive.
–What?

31:10.335 --> 31:13.337
Oh, the “way too passive” guy?

31:13.473 --> 31:15.198
Let me see that.

31:20.934 --> 31:22.178
Look out.

31:28.299 --> 31:30.279
You failed the G.S.R., Barney.

31:31.853 --> 31:34.757
Oh, really?
Can I take it again?

31:34.895 --> 31:40.179
No. In ten minutes, I'll have
a search warrant for your car and home.

31:40.212 --> 31:43.908
I'm gonna find the gun you used
to shoot Helen Zamorski.

31:48.760 --> 31:52.210
–It's three inches.
–Excuse me?

31:53.819 --> 31:55.700
My tire was in the red
three inches…

31:55.740 --> 31:57.465
and she gave me a ticket.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.243
She finds me every time.

32:04.194 --> 32:06.636
I asked her nicely.
She just laughed.

32:17.162 --> 32:19.372
Barney.

32:19.405 --> 32:23.629
If you knew you shot her,
why did you agree to the residue test?

32:23.694 --> 32:26.280
Well, if I didn't take it,
I'd look guilty.

32:26.320 --> 32:29.486
And… And you said
it was a government test…

32:30.002 --> 32:33.419
so I figured,
how reliable could it be?

32:37.143 --> 32:40.018
I just got off the phone with the DA.
They cut a deal with Ripley.

32:40.058 --> 32:42.931
He confessed to the arson
and turned in two accomplices…

32:42.971 --> 32:46.484
with the understanding that
the three of them will do time
together at Terminal Island.

32:46.524 --> 32:49.559
This guy's taking over the
goddamn prisons, consolidating
his guys into one place.

32:49.599 --> 32:51.224
The D.A never
should've signed that.

32:51.264 --> 32:53.593
And we can never charge
Armadillo with this crime.

32:53.633 --> 32:56.933
And since we've got
nothing on the rape, he walks.

32:57.699 --> 32:59.194
I'm afraid so.

32:59.364 --> 33:03.199
You send me on a bogus run.
You cut loose the only lead I have.

33:03.239 --> 33:06.978
And then you let this guy cut a deal that
buries my case. What the hell is going on?

33:07.018 --> 33:10.051
–We want this as much as you do.
–We got three arsonists off the streets.

33:10.091 --> 33:12.966
–That's a pretty good day.
–Save the statistic crowing
for your civilian auditor.

33:13.006 --> 33:15.528
What happened here today
was bullshit!

33:15.792 --> 33:19.474
I don't know exactly
what the puzzle looks like yet…

33:19.507 --> 33:22.477
but the pieces I see
are pretty goddamn ugly.

33:25.301 --> 33:28.667
I have never interfered
with how you run your team…

33:30.520 --> 33:32.278
or how you run for office.

33:32.474 --> 33:36.797
I get assigned a case.
I'm gonna find the truth.

33:36.830 --> 33:40.344
And if I have to go
through both of you… I'll get it.

33:47.236 --> 33:52.324
Dutch just got the meter maid shooter.
Is there a problem?

33:52.487 --> 33:57.569
Just a little misunderstanding.
A difference of opinion. Keeps us all honest.

34:05.711 --> 34:08.080
“Harboring a felon”?

34:08.114 --> 34:11.414
Come on.
That's a stretch, even for this precinct.

34:11.666 --> 34:14.418
–I'll be in touch.
–I know.

34:15.638 --> 34:18.127
I'd rather it didn't
cover my window.

34:18.295 --> 34:21.713
It wouldn't hurt you to look out and be
reminded of what country you're living in.

34:21.753 --> 34:25.268
–I am reminded every time
I look at your ugly face.
–Hey, hey!

34:25.308 --> 34:29.141
–This is my window, my property.
–Move back to your cave, Osama.

34:29.181 --> 34:33.400
Why don't you go back to the jungle?
No job, raising fat, stupid children.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.969
That's it!

34:35.138 --> 34:37.275
–Sir, get back in the house.
–Back inside.

34:37.315 --> 34:39.902
Talk about my boys like that,
and I'll cut your tongue out!

34:39.943 --> 34:43.588
–Drop it!
–Don't you talk about my boys!

34:44.039 --> 34:47.042
–You don't protect me. Allah protect me.
–Put down the gun!

34:47.081 --> 34:49.027
–Drop the gun!
–I do nothing wrong.

34:49.067 --> 34:54.281
–Drop the gun right now!
–I just don't want to be bothered
by her, him, or you.

34:59.186 --> 35:03.312
Zayed. Zayed!

35:04.789 --> 35:07.180
Zayed!

35:07.350 --> 35:11.182
Where's your Allah now?

35:20.286 --> 35:23.480
–Sounds like a clean shoot.
–I didn't have a choice.

35:23.520 --> 35:25.820
C.I.I.D will be here
to do follow up.

35:25.860 --> 35:29.725
Fatality involved. Mandatory
downtime for the next two days.

35:29.765 --> 35:31.588
Just take it easy, okay?

35:31.782 --> 35:33.605
Call if you need anything.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.524
Okay.

35:42.157 --> 35:46.095
Everything seems
exceptionally calm.

35:46.129 --> 35:49.693
No one seems too concerned
about a dead Arab, I guess.

35:51.314 --> 35:55.791
How bad would this scene be for you if
the other neighbor were laying there dead?

35:55.831 --> 35:58.383
People are still looking
for a reason to riot.

35:58.423 --> 36:00.563
It would be very bad.

36:08.605 --> 36:12.666
Is there someone I can call
for you? No one at all?

36:17.155 --> 36:20.573
–What do you mean disappeared?
–I mean they're bone gone.
Three of my best dealers.

36:20.613 --> 36:23.263
–You called?
–Callin', pagin', two-wayin'
They ain't answerin', man.

36:23.303 --> 36:26.785
It's Armadillo. He's probably already
got tires around their goddamn necks.

36:26.825 --> 36:29.250
All right, relax. Round up the rest
of your guys. Get them to lay low.

36:29.290 --> 36:31.496
He's completely punking us, man.

36:31.628 --> 36:35.815
–It's time to send his “cholo-ing” ass south.
–Yeah, like six feet south.

36:35.855 --> 36:41.096
Hey, you relax too. Jesus Christ,
am I the only one thinking around here?

36:55.643 --> 36:57.368
How did the arson go?

36:57.565 --> 36:59.388
All smoke and mirrors.

36:59.582 --> 37:01.688
Why so vague?

37:03.553 --> 37:05.863
–You don't wanna know.
–Sure, I do.

37:07.171 --> 37:10.206
You mean,
you don't wanna tell me.

37:10.340 --> 37:12.650
And you think
you can't read women.

37:19.083 --> 37:21.867
–You okay?
–Oh, yeah, fine. Thanks. Why?

37:22.124 --> 37:23.848
Just… Nothing.

37:23.886 --> 37:26.247
It was great spending time with you.
I hope I didn't make too many mistakes.

37:26.287 --> 37:29.355
Not at all.
Thank you for all your time.

37:29.650 --> 37:33.452
If you wanna talk some more,
maybe we could grab a meal sometime.

37:33.492 --> 37:37.204
Dutch, hitting on me…
that is a mistake.

37:37.398 --> 37:42.486
N-No. I meant if you wanted
to ask some more questions…

37:42.649 --> 37:44.373
I've got a girlfriend.

37:46.587 --> 37:47.832
Christ.

37:47.997 --> 37:49.846
She made a stop
at the county courthouse.

37:49.886 --> 37:53.208
Made copies of the kids'
birth certificates, came here.

37:53.248 --> 37:56.610
–What, a P.I.?
–Yeah. A big one.

37:56.644 --> 38:00.029
He played one season for the Rams.
Thinks he's Dick Butkus.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.826
Jesus.

38:06.985 --> 38:09.474
–Oh, God.
–Liman.

38:09.675 --> 38:12.132
–Morgal.
–This is a confidential matter.

38:12.172 --> 38:15.111
Yeah, a matter of betrayal.
She took his children away from him.

38:15.151 --> 38:17.128
He's been looking for them
for over a month.

38:17.168 --> 38:21.322
–Where are Cassidy and Matt?
–I'm not gonna do this.
–You don't have to answer him.

38:21.362 --> 38:24.652
–Who the hell is this ape?
–Your children are where you can't hurt them.

38:24.692 --> 38:27.266
Hur… What is he talking about?
Corrine.

38:27.286 --> 38:29.168
I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to do.

38:29.208 --> 38:32.177
–Let me do the talking, Corrine.
–Shut your mouth, you big, fat-necked prick.

38:32.217 --> 38:34.675
–One more step and she
signs a restraining order.
–Stop it.

38:34.715 --> 38:36.499
–Corrine!
–I'm scared for our kids.

38:36.539 --> 38:38.966
'Cause of what happened with Gilroy?
That was a one-time thing.

38:39.006 --> 38:41.407
–Let's go.
–Don't do this, Corrine.

38:41.440 --> 38:44.121
–Sorry.
–Corrine, you're not gonna
at least talk to me?

38:44.161 --> 38:46.912
It's not just Gilroy. It's all of it.

38:47.106 --> 38:49.468
–Get out of my way!
–This is exactly the kind
of behavior I'm talking about.

38:49.508 --> 38:52.379
–That's my daughter!
–No!
–Hey, no!

38:54.119 --> 38:57.185
–That's enough, Morgal.
–The I.A.D investigations.

38:57.225 --> 39:00.419
The civil suits. The money
that mysteriously appears.

39:00.459 --> 39:02.307
You got a lot to answer for.

39:02.412 --> 39:05.676
You're investigating me?
Corrine. Corrine!

39:05.838 --> 39:08.905
–I don't know what else to do.
–Corrine!
–Don't.

39:08.945 --> 39:11.085
We'll get them back. Vic!

39:15.061 --> 39:18.227
We'll get them back.

39:24.698 --> 39:27.253
–What?
–Mackey! Mackey!

39:27.452 --> 39:28.663
Tio?

40:22.175 --> 40:24.825
–I asked you to leave.
–This is my house.

40:24.865 --> 40:28.231
Unless you have a warrant,
you're breaking the law.

40:32.710 --> 40:34.434
One of these laws?

40:42.733 --> 40:44.709
I told you to leave.

40:44.846 --> 40:46.570
Vic!

40:48.368 --> 40:51.020
Vic!

40:51.218 --> 40:53.161
You ready to go now, huh?

40:55.988 --> 40:57.745
Vic, Jesus!

41:04.602 --> 41:06.938
I don't have to leave.

41:20.997 --> 41:22.301
You planning to leave?

41:22.341 --> 41:24.677
You'll just have to kill me.

41:27.784 --> 41:30.688
Tell me you're leaving. Say it!

41:36.623 --> 41:38.729
Vic!

41:38.864 --> 41:41.069
I wanna hear you say it.
Say it!

41:41.233 --> 41:44.366
Vic! Vic, that's it!

41:44.500 --> 41:46.282
Come on.
It's all over now.

41:49.783 --> 41:52.337
–No!
–Take it easy.
