A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:10.510 --> 00:11.761
[Edha] Are you OK?

00:21.604 --> 00:24.399
-I'll call a cab for you.
-[Teo] No need.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.526
You should go to the hospital.

00:26.609 --> 00:29.279
Here's money to get yourself checked
and fix your bike.

00:29.362 --> 00:30.864
[Teo] You paying me off?

00:31.197 --> 00:34.659
I'm not going to go to the police.
I could, but I won't.

00:35.827 --> 00:38.204
The precinct, witnesses,
it's a waste of time.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.373
I'm not paying you off.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.042
Give me a job then. That's what I need.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.132
I've got nothing to offer you.

00:54.637 --> 00:56.723
-I've seen you before.
-Me?

00:57.932 --> 01:00.351
Impossible,
I'm not from this neighborhood.

01:04.189 --> 01:06.524
Do you have a cook? A dog?

01:07.442 --> 01:09.235
I can cook, walk the dog.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.364
Teo. Nice to meet you.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.368
Edha.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.543
Sure you don't need anybody?

01:28.588 --> 01:32.300
I have a fashion show this week,
we'll probably need some help. Call me.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.427
Get in.

01:38.389 --> 01:41.226
[doors shut, motor starts]

01:49.734 --> 01:54.364
[Yastin]  Girl, taking and carrying stuff,
without asking, the first time of many.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.241
See? It wasn't so hard.

01:58.159 --> 02:01.663
Women inspire more trust.
Now we finish this,

02:01.746 --> 02:03.998
there'll be a show,
I'll get you on the runway.

02:05.583 --> 02:06.584
Your cut.

02:07.710 --> 02:10.338
With this, you're done with Medina.
Forget about him.

02:10.421 --> 02:11.714
And I'm stuck with you.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.967
Think of it as an investment.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.054
-Can you take it to him?
-Yeah, I can do that.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.099
-OK, El Pija goes with you.
-Let's go.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.726
I take care of myself, Pija.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.825
This is what we owe you. We're done.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.786
This all you've got for me?

02:43.246 --> 02:44.789
You don't owe me anything.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.667
Not until I saw you.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.422
Did that rat Teo send you?
Why didn't he come himself?

02:53.089 --> 02:54.090
Because I came.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.969
Now you came,
I have a problem that I didn't have.

02:59.554 --> 03:04.100
If your husband sends me candy,
I can't turn it down. It wouldn't be nice.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.226
No one gave me away.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.272
-Don't touch me. Ah! Let go of me!
-Come here!

03:09.355 --> 03:11.524
-Come here!
-Don't touch me! Don't--

03:11.983 --> 03:13.401
Ow!

03:17.238 --> 03:19.324
[El Pija] Let her go.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.660
-That kid is mine.
-Pija, dear!

03:22.744 --> 03:25.747
Nice nickname!
You know who gave it to him?

03:26.289 --> 03:28.499
-Daddy.
-Go. Now!

03:29.250 --> 03:31.002
You like trouble, girl.

03:31.085 --> 03:35.131
Don't come near. You have your money.
Stop fucking around.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.052
-[El Pija] Let's go.
-You owe me a ride!

03:42.055 --> 03:45.266
-Do you know him from before?
-Medina raised me.

03:46.559 --> 03:49.854
-How did you get away?
-I left when I was 15.

03:49.938 --> 03:53.066
-Yastin took me in.
-Will you tell me your name?

03:53.524 --> 03:54.901
Christian.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.945
Thank you, Christian.

03:58.279 --> 03:59.447
Take care, kid.

04:09.624 --> 04:10.917
Yastin.

04:11.417 --> 04:16.214
[singing in Hebrew]

04:31.688 --> 04:32.855
Amen.

04:33.356 --> 04:36.025
I made a promise to the investors.
You should care too.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.026
I do care.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.571
[sewing machines whir]

04:40.655 --> 04:41.656
[Antonio] What is it?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.868
-Elena.
-Don't worry so much.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.204
-He'll treat her right.
-I don't know.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.958
-Elena is strong, she'll defend herself.
-Jáuregui isn't after her. He's after me.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.476
[Jáuregui] Orange juice for the princess.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.561
[Elena] Thank you.

05:12.770 --> 05:15.273
-It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
-Yes.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.858
-Is it too hot?
-No.

05:16.941 --> 05:19.319
-Did you put sunscreen on?
-Yes.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.446
[cellphone vibrates]

05:23.531 --> 05:24.824
You're not answering?

05:25.408 --> 05:27.869
No. I'm enjoying an afternoon
with my daughter.

05:29.620 --> 05:30.830
Cheers.

05:35.460 --> 05:39.172
Oh, Molina. It's not very creative, is it?
To accuse the foreman?

05:40.256 --> 05:41.924
I'm not here to innovate.

05:42.675 --> 05:46.220
For creative types,
look in advertising or engineering...

05:46.304 --> 05:48.181
-Art, perhaps.
-Let's talk about the brand.

05:48.264 --> 05:52.018
-Who was this factory sewing for?
-I'm on it. The search turned up empty.

05:52.769 --> 05:56.647
The witnesses don't even know what
they were doing. You know how it is.

05:57.315 --> 06:00.610
I want this case.
And I'll get it somehow, Molina.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.238
You've already decided who's guilty,
haven't you?

06:04.322 --> 06:07.658
-That's futurism, not investigating.
-You know as well as I do.

06:10.495 --> 06:14.123
Why don't you get over your dad's death
with counselling?

06:15.249 --> 06:17.543
We DAs have access to counselling.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.797
It might help you quit smoking.

06:22.256 --> 06:23.716
[DA Ramos] I don't smoke anymore.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.053
[DA Ramos] When the case is mine,
I'll begin a new investigation.

06:29.806 --> 06:30.848
[door closes]

06:32.809 --> 06:37.271
[Yastin] Paloma Zucatzer, Edha.
The show is today, High Couture.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.816
-[Celia] I can't go.
-I already sold you.

06:40.316 --> 06:43.319
-Who, me?
-[Yastin] Yes, I'm one short, get changed.

06:44.153 --> 06:46.155
This is a modeling agency,
not a fruit store.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.950
-[Yastin] I have to deliver.
-She's saying she can't go.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.869
-What part don't you understand?
-Listen to me, Brad Pitt.

06:51.953 --> 06:55.873
You know that loose tongue of mine?
Or have you forgot how you got to Edha?

06:57.375 --> 07:01.504
If I tell them you're the foreman's
brother, you're toast, baby.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.714
I'll wait for you. Let's go.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.426
[cellphone rings]

07:10.680 --> 07:13.141
-[Teo] Yes?
- [Mota]  It's now, you have to do it.

07:13.933 --> 07:14.892
Today?

07:14.976 --> 07:17.979
[Mota]  The DA has changed. They're doing
a new investigation at the sweatshop.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.063
What time?

07:19.147 --> 07:20.940
[Mota]  Anytime now. Hurry up.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.024
OK.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.529
-[Celia] What is it?
-Mota.

07:27.655 --> 07:30.199
They're opening
a new investigation at the factory.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.458
I'm going there.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.043
This time they'll find something.

07:45.673 --> 07:46.966
[door closes]

07:53.222 --> 07:54.307
[inhales]

07:54.390 --> 07:55.683
Come out, I saw you.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.770
Come on, I'm nervous. Don't make it worse.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.109
-What's your friend's name?
-He's not my friend.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.820
You can't name him. I told you what to do.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.034
-And if they ask who sent me?
-They won't.

08:13.117 --> 08:18.206
If you get there it's because you know.
Go where I told you to. Knock the door.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.000
Thank you, Manito.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.796
-Remember what you promised.
-What's wrong with him knowing?

08:25.880 --> 08:28.674
Neither him nor anybody else.
Teo has a very loose tongue.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.760
Nobody can know I went.

08:30.843 --> 08:32.762
You know I do what you tell me.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.680
No, I don't. Prove it to me.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.976
-This is my chance, you know?
-I know.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.104
-Lips sealed?
-I promise.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.578
You can't smoke here.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.048
[Edha] Where are you from?

09:10.466 --> 09:12.426
Me? From the South Zone.

09:13.719 --> 09:16.305
-Where are you from?
-[Celia] You want my address?

09:16.847 --> 09:19.642
-What agency?
-I don't know. Antonio saw her.

09:20.434 --> 09:21.602
My name is Celia Vargas.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.104
Where are you from?

09:23.187 --> 09:25.273
-[Celia] Buenos Aires.
-Which agency?

09:26.732 --> 09:29.735
- [speaking English] How did she get here?
- I have no idea.

09:29.819 --> 09:33.322
It's obvious she has
no agency, though she knows about today.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.366
- She looks really good.
- Yeah.

09:35.449 --> 09:38.536
She's by far the best,
I love that sense of darkness.

09:39.745 --> 09:42.915
- Give her a chance?
- No, no agency.

09:42.999 --> 09:46.252
No references,
I don't know how she got here. No, no.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.176
[Florencia] Girls, we're done here.

09:59.557 --> 10:02.226
-[Celia] Are you OK?
-That's normal, don't worry.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.478
-What did she say?
-Nothing, it doesn't matter.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.522
-Tell me.
-With a name like that...

10:06.606 --> 10:08.441
...she bets you clean the toilet well.

10:08.524 --> 10:10.568
-What else?
-All awful. Pay no attention.

10:10.901 --> 10:12.945
-Don't even tell her.
-No, better not to.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.792
Why don't you tell me in Spanish,
tough girl?

10:27.376 --> 10:29.503
Shit sticks together, you know?

10:29.587 --> 10:31.756
Why are we waiting? We'll be late.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.593
The princess...
That's who we're freezing our asses for.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.219
That bitch?

10:37.303 --> 10:38.846
[laughter]

10:38.929 --> 10:41.974
Stop drinking! You'll swell like toads.
Come on, get going!

10:42.058 --> 10:44.101
Let's get in! Go on, get going!

10:48.648 --> 10:52.193
We're all waiting for you.
Who do you think you are, kid?

10:52.985 --> 10:54.153
I can't go.

10:54.570 --> 10:55.946
Stop screwing around and get in.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.531
-She knows me.
-Who?

10:57.615 --> 11:00.868
That woman, Edha.
She knows me. Teo doesn't know.

11:02.870 --> 11:06.457
Look, I know I owe you one and I'll pay,
but not today.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.459
I can't.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.503
I want to, but I can't.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.593
You're such a cheat.

11:21.889 --> 11:22.932
[motor starts]

11:23.015 --> 11:24.225
Let's go.

11:40.699 --> 11:43.536
-Thank you very much. Nice work.
- Baruch Hashem.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.705
Blessed be the name. Do you understand?

11:48.916 --> 11:52.002
Antonio told me you were a couple.
Do you know him well?

11:53.212 --> 11:54.422
Take care of him.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.216
[motor starts]

12:11.522 --> 12:13.232
Not those, they're awful.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.946
Florencia, I don't want
any wrinkles on the collar.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.993
-Aníbal, start loading the van.
-You told me someone else was doing that.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.411
He hasn't arrived.

12:27.621 --> 12:30.624
The clothes hangers, going to the bank,

12:30.708 --> 12:34.753
running errands to the pharmacy, security,
the suppliers... I do everything.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.298
Speak to Lorenzo
about your trade union problems.

12:47.349 --> 12:50.728
-What's up with Aníbal?
-The usual. Complaining about everything.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.146
Sometimes he's right.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.149
You like him because he's an ass-kisser.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.067
Your problem is he doesn't kiss yours.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.653
No, he stares at mine,
and it's unpleasant.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.281
-Is that so?
-Yes, it is.

13:05.075 --> 13:06.952
Aníbal is here and obeys orders.

13:07.536 --> 13:10.414
That guy you were bringing didn't show up.
Where is he?

13:11.332 --> 13:12.333
[glass shatters]

[DA Ramos]  Come on, come on,
let's go in, gentlemen!

14:00.464 --> 14:05.928
[DA Ramos] C areful in the sewing areas,
everything could be evidence.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.347
[police sirens]

14:08.430 --> 14:12.518
[DA Ramos]  Any papers, any cloth,

14:12.601 --> 14:15.646
any labels could be evidence in the case.

14:21.193 --> 14:26.073
[upbeat music plays]

15:06.614 --> 15:09.658
-So? What's up?
-You're always late?

15:10.326 --> 15:12.786
[Edha] You can't wear that
if you're working with me.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.538
-Antonio!
-[Antonio] Edha.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.000
-Give him proper clothes, please.
-Come this way, please.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.544
[Antonio] Come on.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.257
There's a mirror here, put this on.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.011
Go to hair for a touch-up.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.888
-Where are your boots?
-I don't know.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.950
[Antonio] Hey. Put this on.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.619
Good. Go.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.958
[Antonio] Don't put me on the spot
with Edha. Wait for me.

16:02.753 --> 16:03.796
[Antonio] Edha!

16:05.005 --> 16:06.173
[Edha] Come here.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.680
-What happened here?
-I had an accident on my way here.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.269
That one over there is Aníbal.
He'll tell you what boxes to load.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.688
Tell him you're with me.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.232
I'm "with you"?

16:24.733 --> 16:27.569
You work for me.
That's why you're here, isn't it? Go on.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.408
-Antonio, Maia's boots are missing.
-Where are Maia's boots?

16:32.908 --> 16:36.120
[El Pija] Go on, walk like ladies,
everyone's beneath you.

16:36.203 --> 16:39.123
-Be good, the boss is in a bad mood.
-Get lost.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.083
Park this thing far away.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.753
Hey. We're here for the show,
these are my girls.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.048
Paloma Zucatzer is waiting for us.
Can you do me the favor?

16:51.301 --> 16:52.428
[Elena laughs]

16:52.511 --> 16:53.637
How awful.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.806
So? How do I look?

16:56.765 --> 16:57.683
Bad.

16:57.766 --> 17:00.644
-[Monina] I'm not asking you.
-[Elena] Good, it's really nice.

17:00.728 --> 17:04.273
-Those pants make your ass look fat.
-Your dad loves it.

17:04.857 --> 17:08.027
Well, make something to eat later,
I don't want you ordering in.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.696
-You don't need to open the door.
-Say hi to my mom.

17:10.779 --> 17:14.950
Study hard.
You especially, Delfina, please.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.244
I don't want another year
without a vacation.

17:17.327 --> 17:20.164
-I promise you that won't happen.
-OK, bye!

17:20.956 --> 17:22.458
[bedroom door closes]

17:24.084 --> 17:25.502
[front door closes]

17:32.926 --> 17:35.637
-What are you doing, Del?
-You think I'm studying?

17:35.721 --> 17:37.598
Yes, that's what we're going to do.

17:37.681 --> 17:40.601
I can't tell you the truth
because you're a terrible liar.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.271
-Go on, get changed.
-Where are we going?

17:44.354 --> 17:46.523
-To a party.
-What party?

17:47.024 --> 17:48.358
A party with Sebi.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.403
[Delfina] Come on, get changed.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.538
-Hello.
-No, not that one.

18:02.706 --> 18:07.211
-How are you, Paloma? I'm very well. You?
-Happy. Happy with this.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.797
We're so far removed from the real world.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.716
You converted to Buddhism or something?

18:12.800 --> 18:16.637
No, I'm talking about our work.
We have to get engaged with reality.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.722
-Which reality?
-The production one.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.267
-Didn't you hear what happened?
-No.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.561
Another fire. Another clothes factory.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.939
Tremendous. How many is that now?

18:28.607 --> 18:31.819
The investors were very pleased
with you after that dinner.

18:32.569 --> 18:33.987
You do a fine job.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.782
Yes. Hurried, but tidy.

18:36.865 --> 18:40.119
[Paloma] Let's go to our area.
We're bothering the other designers here.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.247
Inclusive beauty?

18:43.664 --> 18:45.749
She's no fool. I'll look shallow now.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.418
-The investors asked for some of that.
-You didn't tell me.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.962
I don't follow whims.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.672
-Except your own.
-Except my own.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.675
[Edha] Is everyone dressed?

18:56.218 --> 18:59.721
[electronic music plays]

19:01.807 --> 19:03.058
[crowd cheers]

19:06.728 --> 19:09.481
[crowd cheers]

19:54.693 --> 19:57.696
[crowd cheers]

20:23.055 --> 20:26.141
[crowd cheers]

21:24.199 --> 21:28.704
[crowd applaud]

21:33.834 --> 21:36.670
[crowd scream]

21:45.512 --> 21:47.472
Florencia, have you seen the new guy?

21:48.473 --> 21:50.183
-The new helper?
-Teo.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.269
[Florencia] No, I haven't seen him.

21:52.519 --> 21:55.856
[crowd applause continues]

21:57.190 --> 21:59.109
Delfi! Delfi!

21:59.484 --> 22:01.361
-Eh?
-Stay here, I'm leaving.

22:01.445 --> 22:05.115
-Where are you going?
-Wait. I left my things in your house.

22:05.198 --> 22:06.575
-Go on then.
-Let's go.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.535
-How do I get home?
-Take these.

22:08.618 --> 22:11.413
-No, I'm not going alone, let's go!
-Calm down, take them!

22:11.496 --> 22:12.873
Go on, Elena, just go!

22:49.868 --> 22:51.244
[Julián] Where's Delfina?

22:51.661 --> 22:52.662
[Elena] She's coming.

22:54.831 --> 22:57.584
-She's coming, from where?
-A party.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.671
Weren't you supposed to be studying?

23:03.090 --> 23:04.633
We studied, then went out.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.264
I came back early
because I wasn't feeling well.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.600
-You threw up again?
-[Elena] No.

23:13.683 --> 23:15.435
No, I'm a little dizzy.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.062
I got dizzy, I don't know.

23:18.814 --> 23:21.566
But I'm going now. I came to get my keys--

23:21.650 --> 23:23.652
It's very late, Ele. Did you eat?

23:24.903 --> 23:25.821
No.

23:26.863 --> 23:28.740
Eat something and then sleep here.

23:29.032 --> 23:31.910
-I'm not hungry.
-You get dizzy because you don't eat.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.203
That's what happened.

23:34.162 --> 23:35.914
Or I can call your mom.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.751
No, it's OK. I'll eat.

23:40.877 --> 23:42.254
I won't be eating alone.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.841
It's after 12. It's my birthday.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.474
It didn't turn out as I hoped.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.226
It was delicious.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.108
You shouldn't lie to me.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.236
-No, I liked it.
-No, I mean Delfi.

24:06.319 --> 24:09.364
I know she smokes and does other things,
I'm not an idiot.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.784
Hard to believe, but I was your age once.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.161
[she laughs]

24:16.496 --> 24:21.668
I understand everything's
more... complicated these days.

24:21.751 --> 24:24.713
I don't like her not telling me
because if something happens,

24:24.796 --> 24:26.298
I don't know where she is.

24:26.381 --> 24:28.049
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

24:30.051 --> 24:32.304
Anyway, it's not your fault.

24:33.138 --> 24:36.099
You always do things... correctly.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.731
-What? Did I say something wrong?
-No.

24:43.356 --> 24:44.733
Your face says "yes."

24:46.401 --> 24:49.362
I'm always the idiot, the boring one.

24:49.946 --> 24:52.115
I'm sick of doing the right thing.

24:52.199 --> 24:55.952
I don't think so. I know very well
the price of being a goody two-shoes.

24:56.369 --> 25:00.415
Look, I'm the eldest of three.
I was always the cleanest, the tidiest,

25:00.498 --> 25:04.544
the best student, the cutest...
The cutest, no. That was Lucas.

25:05.420 --> 25:09.049
Nice is being here with you
and having you listen to me.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.820
-We're like worms, you and me.
-What?

26:53.903 --> 26:58.241
They cut us in half and we live on.
We survive everything.

26:58.325 --> 26:59.534
Cheers.

26:59.617 --> 27:03.538
They're here. Despite the scene you made
at the restaurant, here they are.

27:03.621 --> 27:06.124
-They liked the collection.
-Oh, they went crazy.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.209
It wasn't crazy
putting the workshop at home.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.794
No, it wasn't so crazy.

27:09.878 --> 27:13.006
Focus on the new collection
and we'll present it to them soon.

27:26.686 --> 27:28.855
[door opens]

27:48.333 --> 27:49.667
Why didn't you go?

27:50.627 --> 27:52.462
Why are you dressed like that?

27:52.545 --> 27:53.963
[she sighs]

27:55.131 --> 27:56.633
I got into trouble.

27:57.884 --> 28:00.095
I got the money and paid Medina for you.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.389
Where did you get the money?
What did you do?

28:02.472 --> 28:03.765
What did I do?

28:05.809 --> 28:08.353
I saved your life,
while you were playing detective.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.021
-Look, Celia--
-What do I do...

28:10.105 --> 28:12.565
...if something happens to you, Teo?
Where do I go?

28:13.358 --> 28:17.195
Manito is gone, now you...
Why the fuck did I come with you two?

28:17.695 --> 28:19.114
So you'd leave me alone?

28:21.741 --> 28:23.076
[sighs]

28:23.159 --> 28:26.663
Manito shouldn't have been there
when the factory caught fire.

28:26.955 --> 28:27.997
It wasn't your fault.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.460
If we hadn't told him the truth,
he'd be here.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.340
Manito is here...

28:38.425 --> 28:39.843
...with us.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.137
He always will be.

28:45.765 --> 28:47.183
[laughs]

28:47.809 --> 28:49.102
Look at your clothes.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.690
They're shit. Take them off.

29:33.313 --> 29:39.068
[DA Ramos]  After a second appraisal,
among other evidence, a roll of labels

29:39.152 --> 29:45.325
with the inscription EDHA was found,
which would involve the clothing brand

29:45.408 --> 29:50.997
with the place's activity, which was
determined to be that of a sweatshop.

29:54.083 --> 29:57.295
This gives us grounds for suspicion
over any and all persons

29:57.378 --> 30:01.049
who can be proven to have entered
or left the burnt-down factory...

30:05.470 --> 30:09.390
...among which we note the presence
of the deceased foreman's brother,

30:09.474 --> 30:11.935
as well as the apparent girlfriend
of one or both.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.415
So? Where did you go this time?

30:37.502 --> 30:39.003
Did you eat at his place?

30:40.004 --> 30:41.005
Yes.

30:43.424 --> 30:45.009
What did you do after?

30:45.718 --> 30:47.804
-Nothing.
-What do you mean, "nothing"?

30:49.013 --> 30:50.014
We were alone.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.560
You were alone when you went
for Japanese? What else?

30:55.520 --> 30:56.729
We ate well.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.982
What are you saying?
I'm talking to myself.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.442
-What?
-What's wrong with you?

31:01.526 --> 31:03.194
-Nothing.
-Where are you?

31:03.278 --> 31:04.237
Here.

31:06.322 --> 31:07.407
Did he treat you well?

31:11.035 --> 31:12.203
Yeah, it was weird.

31:13.621 --> 31:14.747
Weird, how?

31:15.373 --> 31:16.875
I don't know, Mom.

31:21.045 --> 31:23.882
[Molina] They did a new investigation
and some labels showed up.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.386
-And you're just telling me now, Molina?
-I just found out.

31:28.469 --> 31:31.681
The labels were never sewn on
in the factory. It was an express order.

31:31.764 --> 31:33.766
It's textbook stuff. I don't believe it.

31:34.183 --> 31:36.394
Their value as evidence is dubious.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.063
That ass-wipe Pereyra did something shady.

31:39.147 --> 31:42.442
That son of a bitch has got it in for me.
He's capable of anything.

31:42.525 --> 31:45.904
That report has no legal worth.
I still had the case.

31:46.362 --> 31:50.033
There's just hours between the report
and the case being passed to him.

31:50.783 --> 31:51.701
The same file?

31:52.660 --> 31:54.954
No, a federal judge.

31:56.039 --> 31:58.958
-A people trafficking and slavery case.
-No!

31:59.042 --> 32:00.460
[inhales deeply]

32:00.543 --> 32:03.421
-Can you do something?
-No, not me.

32:03.504 --> 32:06.716
-You can, you have to do something.
-Me? But tell me what.

32:06.799 --> 32:09.719
You have to sacrifice someone.
Someone has to fall.

32:10.178 --> 32:12.805
-But who?
-I don't know. Think about it.

32:13.264 --> 32:15.099
[Molina] This will help you.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.900
[Molina] Take my advice.

32:24.567 --> 32:25.652
Hello, daughter.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.237
A pleasure.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.202
Why did you bring me here?

32:34.285 --> 32:36.454
Well, this is a private place.

32:36.537 --> 32:38.748
I invited him. The DA did me a favor.

32:38.831 --> 32:41.501
-We can't be seen together.
-Something happened?

32:42.627 --> 32:43.711
Yes.

32:44.379 --> 32:45.463
What?

32:46.214 --> 32:48.174
-Something of a delicate nature.
-What?

32:48.257 --> 32:50.843
What do you think, Edha?
The fire at the factory.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.638
-You said that was taken care of.
-It was.

32:53.721 --> 32:55.682
-The case has gone to another DA.
-And?

32:57.433 --> 32:58.601
We could go to prison...

33:02.105 --> 33:05.066
...unless I do what Molina suggested.

33:06.067 --> 33:07.026
What did he say?

33:07.110 --> 33:10.405
That if someone, Antonio, for instance...

33:11.364 --> 33:14.367
...were to give himself up voluntarily...

33:15.076 --> 33:18.121
...to show we have nothing to hide,
it could help us.

33:19.330 --> 33:20.623
Do you understand?

33:23.626 --> 33:26.879
-Why Antonio?
-I don't cut fabric, Edha.

33:26.963 --> 33:30.216
-Leave this to me.
-Not Antonio. Don't drag him into this.

33:30.299 --> 33:32.468
Relax, it will be fine. I promise.

33:34.262 --> 33:35.888
It will be dealt with quickly?

33:35.972 --> 33:38.099
Absolutely.
Pastene will take care of everything.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.977
He's been my lawyer my whole life.
You know him.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.979
[Lorenzo] He'll tell you what to say.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.064
Are you on board?

33:45.148 --> 33:48.317
Listen, Antonio.
I'm not feeding you to the dogs.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.695
If things go badly for you,
they do for me.

33:51.404 --> 33:53.948
You're the number-one employee
in this company.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.034
I'm ultimately responsible.

33:56.117 --> 33:59.203
-It's just a show of good faith.
-That's right.

34:02.623 --> 34:03.916
What do you think?

34:05.585 --> 34:07.211
I don't know anything about this.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.049
It's best to let Lorenzo take care of it.

34:12.633 --> 34:16.262
Listen, I assure you that in three days
this case will be closed

34:16.345 --> 34:20.892
and we can forget all about it.
I've got the investors after me.

34:20.975 --> 34:24.020
I need to seal the deal,
and you're essential in that.

34:28.858 --> 34:31.694
-[Monina] Is Sebastián going to be long?
-I texted him.

34:32.278 --> 34:34.655
-[Monina] And?
-[Delfina] He hasn't read it yet.

34:35.823 --> 34:39.660
Don't worry about me.
I'll survive if Sebastián can't make it.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.746
[Delfina] You're so mean.

34:41.829 --> 34:45.083
Let's order drinks. I don't like
taking up a table and not ordering.

34:45.166 --> 34:48.628
-No, let's wait.
-Just the drinks.

34:48.711 --> 34:51.172
No, Mom, we have to wait.

34:51.255 --> 34:55.426
Happy birthday to you!

34:56.135 --> 35:00.431
Happy birthday to you!

35:00.515 --> 35:02.683
Happy birthday...

35:03.267 --> 35:06.854
-[Sebastián] And out of respect.
-[Julián] There are better ways...

35:06.938 --> 35:08.439
[Sebastián] How old are you?

35:09.148 --> 35:14.570
[indistinct chatter]

35:20.451 --> 35:21.953
Happy birthday, Julián.

35:22.662 --> 35:23.996
I'm going to the bathroom.

35:39.053 --> 35:40.388
Aníbal sent for me.

35:43.057 --> 35:44.559
Are you going to escape again?

35:46.227 --> 35:49.981
Last chance. If you pass, you stay.
If not, you're out.

35:51.274 --> 35:52.692
[doorbell rings]

35:54.318 --> 35:56.404
[keys jingle]

35:56.487 --> 35:57.738
I'll be right back.

36:13.087 --> 36:14.672
-Edha Abadi?
-Yes.

36:15.214 --> 36:17.967
Andrés Pereyra Ramos... DA.

36:54.003 --> 36:56.964
[door creaks open]

37:32.291 --> 37:33.292
[Manito] Half.

37:34.377 --> 37:37.546
-I have to deliver it today.
-Make do with that.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.131
Don't bust my balls.

37:40.299 --> 37:41.842
[Aníbal] What are you looking for?

37:43.386 --> 37:45.304
You were going through this stuff. Why?

37:48.224 --> 37:49.267
Stop playing dumb.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.686
I know you're planning something.

37:51.769 --> 37:55.022
This is my house. Here we have
the showroom and the offices.

37:55.606 --> 37:58.818
We set up workshops
according to production demands.

37:58.901 --> 38:00.778
And how is current demand?

38:00.861 --> 38:03.656
Low. We just finished a collection.

38:04.115 --> 38:07.159
-And where was that made?
-Right here. I made it.

38:07.243 --> 38:08.703
Ah. You?

38:09.537 --> 38:13.249
And how did you supply the businesses,
the quantity production?

38:13.582 --> 38:15.584
We work with four factories and a tailor.

38:16.043 --> 38:17.420
We never had any trouble.

38:17.503 --> 38:19.171
Anyway, I don't deal with that.

38:19.255 --> 38:22.258
Contact our lawyer
or failing that, Lorenzo Abadi.

38:22.341 --> 38:23.551
-Lorenzo Abadi?
-Yes.

38:25.177 --> 38:27.888
Tell your father
I'll contact him later, OK?

38:29.473 --> 38:31.684
Have you ever considered
an Italian collar?

38:32.601 --> 38:33.561
Excuse me?

38:34.353 --> 38:37.106
Your ties would look much better
with an Italian collar.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.442
But to each his own.

38:45.281 --> 38:47.908
The police are outside. Explain to them.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.244
-I've got nothing to explain.
-What is this?

38:50.328 --> 38:52.705
-[Aníbal] He was in your workshop--
-What were you doing?

38:52.788 --> 38:54.332
No one can go in there.

38:54.415 --> 38:57.918
-Search me if you want.
-He's new, he doesn't know the rules.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.128
Come with me.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.926
[door opens]

39:10.806 --> 39:11.640
[door closes]

39:15.353 --> 39:16.604
Get up here.

39:21.108 --> 39:24.111
Aníbal was right.
I don't let anybody come in here.

39:24.653 --> 39:27.615
-Let's go somewhere else.
-No, I want to try something on you.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.368
[Edha]  Teo is much more than a model...

39:30.951 --> 39:32.953
...or a support for my designs.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.790
Teo is real. Unique.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.041
Everything.

39:40.294 --> 39:43.130
[Edha]  A feeling that's impossible
to define resides in him.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.257
His story, his mystery.

39:46.425 --> 39:49.178
What I don't know about him
is as compelling as what I do.

39:50.096 --> 39:52.098
-The pants too?
-What did this?

39:53.265 --> 39:55.893
-I cut myself with a glass shard.
-Accidentally?

39:55.976 --> 39:57.019
Yes.

39:59.438 --> 40:01.357
[Edha]  Teo is the perfect model.

40:03.943 --> 40:07.321
I don't know if you'll like it.
No one really does.

40:07.947 --> 40:11.325
You just have to bear with it.
Sometimes it gets tiring.

40:11.951 --> 40:13.244
Tiring? This?

40:13.327 --> 40:15.246
There are worse jobs, I'm not stupid.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.707
There's a false belief about this job.

40:18.791 --> 40:20.751
No one knows what it's really about.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.379
Girls come with an air of triumph...

40:24.171 --> 40:26.924
...without knowing
they're going to crash and burn.

40:27.675 --> 40:29.301
They live by themselves.

40:30.010 --> 40:33.222
Then the agency calls them,
sends them to Japan or Australia.

40:33.806 --> 40:36.016
With a guide under their arm...

40:36.725 --> 40:39.437
...they only learn how to say
"hello" and "please."

40:40.396 --> 40:42.273
They're old by the time they're 25.

40:44.233 --> 40:45.443
Don't touch it.

40:47.319 --> 40:49.905
-How old are you?
-Thirty-five.

40:50.739 --> 40:52.074
You're old.

40:53.576 --> 40:54.535
Old for what?

40:56.954 --> 40:58.289
For almost everything.

41:02.126 --> 41:03.669
I don't know what I'm doing.

41:04.044 --> 41:06.964
You don't? Model.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.259
A model for my brand.

41:13.429 --> 41:16.891
-Don't you make women's clothing?
-I have some designs for men.

41:18.184 --> 41:19.477
Exceptional.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.271
An attempt that never succeeded.

41:26.942 --> 41:29.111
-No one liked them?
-People liked them.

41:29.195 --> 41:31.030
But I didn't know how to continue them.

41:31.906 --> 41:33.991
-What was your name?
-Teo.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.913
Welcome to Edha, Teo.

41:40.956 --> 41:42.666
