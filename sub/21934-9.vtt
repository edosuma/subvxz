WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.736
CABE:
It started as a normal night.

00:02.770 --> 00:04.105
I was getting ready
to watch my favorite show.

00:04.138 --> 00:06.140
(music plays over television)

00:09.443 --> 00:11.512
My dad was at work.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.414
My mom was mopping.

00:13.447 --> 00:16.417
I remember because I love
the pine smell of that soap.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.285
(popcorn popping)

00:17.318 --> 00:20.254
Could hear popcorn
on the stove.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.591
(doorbell rings)

00:31.099 --> 00:33.267
That was the night
my father died.

00:33.301 --> 00:35.669
H-How did you feel
in that moment

00:35.703 --> 00:38.172
or in the moments
that followed?

00:38.206 --> 00:39.807
I felt blessed.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.475
Blessed?

00:41.509 --> 00:43.344
Blessed to have such
a strong mother

00:43.377 --> 00:45.779
that was able to get the two
of us through such a tough time.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.115
That's wonderful.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.483
And powerful.

00:52.220 --> 00:55.823
Well, still, though,
loss of a father...

00:55.856 --> 00:59.593
My father died a hero,
and I had it better than most.

00:59.627 --> 01:02.196
I mean, I learned more
from that old man in nine years

01:02.230 --> 01:04.765
than most people learn
in a lifetime.

01:04.798 --> 01:07.301
I was blessed.

01:07.335 --> 01:08.469
Yeah, there's no doubt

01:08.502 --> 01:10.304
he was a good father.
You're proof of that.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.473
(chuckles lightly)

01:12.506 --> 01:15.776
Didn't you ever wonder why this
happened to such a good man?

01:15.809 --> 01:19.680
You know, a lot of people ask,
"Why me?"

01:19.713 --> 01:21.749
But why not me?

01:21.782 --> 01:24.785
Bad things happen all the time.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.220
Why should I be exempt?

01:28.356 --> 01:29.457
(timer dings)

01:29.490 --> 01:31.892
Time's up.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.894
Hey, thank you
for opening up about that.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.131
I-I know you don't
like sharing and...

01:37.165 --> 01:39.233
hardly ever talk
about your father.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.868
I guess it's not
really therapy

01:40.901 --> 01:43.237
unless you dig into
Mom and Dad, huh?

01:43.271 --> 01:44.505
That's true.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.274
Hey, I'm glad we got
this session in.

01:46.307 --> 01:49.177
I haven't seen you around much
the past few weeks.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.145
Like you only drop in between
cases to mooch meals.

01:51.179 --> 01:54.615
You know, I'm doing some, uh,
legal research for my trial,

01:54.648 --> 01:56.217
trying to lighten
Sly's workload.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.519
Sly hasn't mentioned anything.

01:58.552 --> 02:01.855
I haven't found anything useful.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.292
There's nothing to report.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.206
Well, I hope you
and your friends are hungry.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.607
PAIGE:
Hope you guys aren't too hungry.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.875
Thanksgiving on a tight budget.

02:21.909 --> 02:24.245
Glad Toby likes
canned cranberry

02:24.278 --> 02:25.313
'cause we can't afford
to make the real thing.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.181
And Tom Turkey is a little

02:27.215 --> 02:28.349
smaller than last year.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.318
Oh, Thomas. That's a great name
for a boy.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.420
I can't talk about this
with you anymore.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.522
Why? Picking baby names
is the fun part.

02:34.555 --> 02:35.689
Baby?

02:35.723 --> 02:37.191
Did I miss an announcement?

02:37.225 --> 02:39.427
No. No baby
on the immediate horizon,

02:39.460 --> 02:41.362
but Toby is determined

02:41.395 --> 02:42.530
to pick a name pronto.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.431
He read a study

02:43.464 --> 02:45.766
about how a strong name
increases chances

02:45.799 --> 02:47.268
of a successful life.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.869
Totally irrational.
HAPPY:
Agreed.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.238
The thing is, Toby wants
to name the kid

02:50.271 --> 02:52.873
after a distinguished
relative,

02:52.906 --> 02:54.875
and that takes us back
a few generations

02:54.908 --> 02:57.811
and I do not want to end up
raising an Obadiah Curtis,

02:57.845 --> 02:59.747
so I need some alternatives.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.450
Well, one obvious alternative

03:02.483 --> 03:04.818
would be to name the baby Walter

03:04.852 --> 03:06.620
or Walena if it's a girl.

03:08.356 --> 03:11.792
You said Toby wants a name
that invokes success.

03:11.825 --> 03:12.993
TOBY: Let me save everyone
the suspense.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.728
There's not a chance our bambino

03:14.762 --> 03:16.497
is gonna be saddled
with either one of those names.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.931
I'm sorry, Walena.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.472
Hey, is it here? Did it come?

03:24.505 --> 03:25.773
Thought you were taking
a vacation day.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.441
SYLVESTER: Uh, I did, but
the new Chair of Blades book

03:27.475 --> 03:29.310
comes out today,
and I had it delivered here

03:29.343 --> 03:31.412
instead of my apartment.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.980
Okay, you got a package
an hour ago.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.386
(laughs)

03:40.454 --> 03:41.855
It took J. Randall P. Smythe

03:41.889 --> 03:43.724
ten years to write this.

03:43.757 --> 03:47.295
Ah, its weight is the heft

03:47.328 --> 03:49.863
of literary substance.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.432
TOBY: Sly, the book's
about magic.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.667
Magic is for children's birthday
parties, not grown men.

03:53.701 --> 03:54.668
This is all nonsense.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.637
Nuh-uh.
Look at that chair.

03:56.670 --> 03:57.871
It's made of blades.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.006
Can't sit in that chair.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.040
Your body would be shred
to pieces.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.442
Not if you're a Klentorian

04:01.475 --> 04:03.010
because their bodies
are impervious.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.945
It's another example
of the infantilization

04:04.978 --> 04:06.280
of American culture.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.648
CABE:
I love those books.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.317
Does that make me an infant?

04:11.752 --> 04:12.753
Anyway...

04:14.021 --> 04:16.357
What's with
the thermos, buddy?

04:16.390 --> 04:17.591
Oh, I was inspired

04:17.625 --> 04:19.593
by Walt's
brain food regimen,

04:19.627 --> 04:21.329
so this is a fish-based
protein shake

04:21.362 --> 04:22.396
to get me through the read.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.300
No meal breaks.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.836
This is gonna be an all-nighter.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.471
FLORENCE:
Excuse me.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.973
Where is this child's mother?

04:33.006 --> 04:35.042
Right here. What's going on?

04:35.075 --> 04:36.944
I think this belongs to you.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.479
Yes, his name's Ralph.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.748
Let go of his wrist, please.
What's going on?

04:40.781 --> 04:42.850
He was crawling through
the ceiling vents in my lab.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.051
That is, until he fell

04:44.084 --> 04:45.353
through the ceiling

04:45.386 --> 04:47.355
and destroyed
a very expensive set

04:47.388 --> 04:49.357
of Erlenmeyer flasks.
Are you okay?

04:49.390 --> 04:51.525
He's fine. I checked.
What were you looking for
up there?

04:51.559 --> 04:52.493
Parental guidance, perhaps.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.795
Could you please
let my son answer? Spill it.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.630
Some of our waxworms
matured into moths

04:56.664 --> 04:57.698
and flew into the vents.

04:57.731 --> 04:58.799
I know Florence is

04:58.832 --> 05:00.868
particular about
her work space,

05:00.901 --> 05:02.536
so I went to retrieve them

05:02.570 --> 05:03.504
so that she wouldn't
get upset.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.872
How'd that work out for you?

05:04.905 --> 05:07.441
Ralph, what do you
have to say?

05:07.475 --> 05:09.410
Those vents are
poorly constructed.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.612
You're reading
the room wrong, kid.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.949
I apologize.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.586
Well, I don't blame you.

05:18.619 --> 05:21.422
You're a child,
curious and unformed.

05:21.455 --> 05:25.993
It is the job of your parent
to keep an eye on you.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.461
Paige is an excellent mother.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.463
If you must know,

05:29.497 --> 05:31.865
I give Ralph a little
bit more freedom

05:31.899 --> 05:34.001
because he is a genius.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.737
What a shock-- an L.A. mother
who thinks that her child

05:36.770 --> 05:37.905
is a genius.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.741
And watch your moth infestation.

05:40.774 --> 05:41.975
HAPPY:
It's not an infestation.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.444
It's a solution we've devised

05:43.477 --> 05:45.379
for NOAA, National
Oceanic...

05:45.413 --> 05:47.381
And Atmospheric Administration.
I'm familiar.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.949
It is a prestigious job.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.651
We're cleaning
the Great Pacific Garbage Patch,

05:50.684 --> 05:53.921
a 500-ton mass of plastic shards
floating in the ocean.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.589
HAPPY:
Until a piece the size

05:55.623 --> 05:57.124
of a football field broke off,

05:57.157 --> 05:59.092
started drifting
toward the West Coast,

05:59.126 --> 06:01.028
leaching chemicals as it goes.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.696
I am assuming you're using

06:02.730 --> 06:04.532
waxworms because they eat
and digest plastic,

06:04.565 --> 06:05.966
rendering it nontoxic.

06:05.999 --> 06:10.003
I can see that you developed
some sort of binding agent?

06:10.037 --> 06:11.071
We spray it on
the plastic shards

06:11.104 --> 06:12.973
so it hardens into
a solid mass.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.608
That way we can walk
right onto the trash

06:14.642 --> 06:16.009
and scatter the worms.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.445
Just what geniuses do.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.713
It's a foolproof solution.
(snorts lightly)

06:19.747 --> 06:24.985
If you consider a 93%
success rate foolproof.

06:25.018 --> 06:25.986
Excuse me?

06:26.019 --> 06:28.589
Your binding agent is flawed.

06:28.622 --> 06:31.459
It has a chemical that will
partially pass through the worms

06:31.492 --> 06:33.461
intact, right back
into the Pacific.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.429
I estimate a seven percent rate
of failure.

06:35.463 --> 06:38.799
That would leave 35 tons
of plastic in the ocean.

06:38.832 --> 06:42.002
Well, that's assuming she's
correct, which she isn't.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.905
Our formula is better than
every existing binding agent.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.941
Not every existing
binding agent.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.810
The one that I
made in my lab,

06:49.843 --> 06:51.979
despite constant
interruptions,

06:52.012 --> 06:53.814
is fully organic.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.048
No chemical coating.

06:55.082 --> 06:58.619
Your worms could digest a
hundred percent of the plastic.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.554
Last time I checked,
a hundred percent

07:00.588 --> 07:02.756
is better than 93,
but I'm not a genius.

07:02.790 --> 07:03.991
I'm just a chemist.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.961
Lucky for you guys,

07:07.995 --> 07:10.531
my lab has run into a
bit of a funding gap,

07:10.564 --> 07:13.000
so I'm willing to tag along

07:13.033 --> 07:14.067
for one sixth of the take.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.003
Absolutely not.
PAIGE:
Walter, perhaps we should...

07:16.036 --> 07:17.638
I don't like her.
Excuse me.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.007
Walter, you're letting
your personal feelings

07:20.040 --> 07:21.542
get in the way of work.

07:21.575 --> 07:24.177
Now, if her product is more
effec... more effective,

07:24.211 --> 07:26.547
then we'll do a better job
with the 100-yard chunk

07:26.580 --> 07:28.849
of ocean trash,
and perhaps we'll get hired

07:28.882 --> 07:31.552
to clean up the rest and then
we won't be broke anymore.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.721
She's arrogant
and condescending.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.989
Oh, hi, pot. I see
you've met kettle.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.125
HAPPY: I know she stinks,
but since when does

07:38.158 --> 07:40.594
Walter O'Brien choose
the less efficient route?

07:44.532 --> 07:45.766
You have a deal.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.936
At one-sixth our fee, assuming
your product passes inspection.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.572
So, we leave in... 40 minutes.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.206
So, let's pack up the worms.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.241
It's today?

07:54.274 --> 07:56.744
It's Thanksgiving.
Not that it's
your business,

07:56.777 --> 07:59.680
but NOAA charges a great deal
for use of their boats,

07:59.713 --> 08:01.649
so we procured one of our own.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.651
And the rates are cheapest
on Thanksgiving.

08:03.684 --> 08:04.685
Wonderful.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.655
You have holiday plans,
so you can't come with us.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.223
Actually...

08:10.257 --> 08:12.059
I'm free.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.260
WALTER:
No plans.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.529
No friends.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.830
How not shocking.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.299
(car horn honking)

08:19.332 --> 08:20.868
Oh, Ralph, that's
your troop leader.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.970
Don't forget our contribution
for the food drive,

08:23.003 --> 08:24.972
and I'll see you tonight
at dinner.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.875
Hey, Paige, can I get a word
with you in the kitchen?

08:27.908 --> 08:31.579
You know, I think I'm gonna
hang back, make the yams.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.947
You don't cook.

08:33.981 --> 08:38.218
Cabe is on the verge of a
major breakthrough in therapy.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.219
I think I can really help him

08:39.252 --> 08:42.322
with all his fears about
the trial and prison.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.092
I mean, we're making
some good progress here.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.126
That's great.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.095
I think it'd be good if
I stay here with him.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.631
I mean, you don't really
need me or an unarmed intern

08:50.664 --> 08:52.633
to scatter worms on garbage.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.334
No, but we'll be
a pair of hands short.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.137
SYLVESTER:
Yes.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.708
I got a solution.

09:02.710 --> 09:03.944
Hey, buddy.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.246
Hey, pal.

09:06.279 --> 09:10.584
I have to tell you,
I am just loving my vacation.

09:10.618 --> 09:14.054
I'm just loving my vacation.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.789
Oh, man.

09:25.766 --> 09:28.268
Okay, Ralph's pumpkin launcher
is loaded.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.070
Now, the balls have
a three-second timer,

09:30.103 --> 09:32.740
so it should explode
shortly after launch,

09:32.773 --> 09:35.342
raining binding agent
down on plastic shards

09:35.375 --> 09:36.644
and hardening the plastic.

09:36.677 --> 09:37.711
That's assuming that

09:37.745 --> 09:39.312
your chemical
solution works.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.614
It does.

09:40.648 --> 09:41.815
HAPPY:
Walt, hold up.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.017
I ran the physics,
I know the launch angle,

09:44.051 --> 09:45.185
give me that sucker.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.023
Fire in the hole!

09:50.057 --> 09:51.992
(shouts)

09:54.762 --> 09:55.863
All right.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.666
The agent should congeal the
plastic into one solid mass.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.668
It'll be safe to walk on
in about two hours.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.771
Looks like you've got some time
to read.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.239
Best vacation ever.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.946
Look at you, pretty handy
with a yam.

10:12.980 --> 10:16.116
Yeah, you don't need an IQ
like yours to peel vegetables.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.251
That story you were
telling me earlier

10:18.285 --> 10:20.721
got me thinking
about those old TVs.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.155
Grandmother had one.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.692
I loved it, except the reception
was always so fuzzy.

10:24.725 --> 10:27.027
Not ours. Perfect picture.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.429
Hmm.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.699
That stove-top popcorn,

10:31.732 --> 10:33.366
ah, that brought me
back, too.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.703
Used to love watching
the tinfoil rise,

10:35.736 --> 10:37.738
but that bottom layer
always got burnt.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.873
Not the way my mom did it.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.709
Was good to the last kernel.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.412
I'm gonna hit the head.
Be right back.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.786
Patient confirms
likely fictitious recollections.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.756
His details are suffering
from nostalgic whitewashing

10:55.789 --> 10:57.257
where no bad memory,

10:57.290 --> 10:58.792
even something as small
as burnt popcorn,

10:58.826 --> 11:00.060
is allowed to exist.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.996
Further research is required.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.434
Plastic's consolidated.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.136
FLORENCE:
Two hours on the dot.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.238
My binding agent
worked perfectly.

11:11.271 --> 11:14.141
Well, let's hope it doesn't
disintegrate under our feet.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.008
Be careful.

11:17.344 --> 11:20.147
Look at you, walking
right across the water.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.883
Toby always said
Walt had a god complex.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.952
Solid as advertised.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.721
(quietly): Congratulations,
you perfected glue.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.990
Okay, let's get to it. Sly,
help Happy unpack the worms.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.126
That was not a part
of my vacation.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.029
It's just 'cause Toby
wanted to make yams.

11:37.464 --> 11:41.034
HAPPY: Been watching
these guys for an hour now.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.771
They start eating as soon
as they hit pay dirt.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.338
This is gonna work better
than we thought.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.439
WALTER:
Yeah.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.342
Uh, Paige?

11:49.376 --> 11:51.178
The current
is starting to drift

11:51.211 --> 11:52.312
the boat away from the island.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.346
Could you guys
secure the vessel?

11:53.380 --> 11:54.347
PAIGE:
We've been trying.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.382
Attempting to steady this boat

11:55.415 --> 11:57.217
while Sly parks this baby.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.820
I don't know
when that's going to happen.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.454
Having a little bit
of trouble dropping anchor.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.991
Have you tried
a high-fiber diet?

12:05.292 --> 12:07.527
Well, that kind of humor
is Toby's influence.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.461
SYLVESTER:
Guys, seriously.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.930
I'm jammed up.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.765
I'll let that one lie.

12:11.799 --> 12:14.067
PAIGE: Walt, we can't get
this anchor mechanism to work.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.435
We're gonna drift a little bit,
but when you're done,

12:15.468 --> 12:16.837
we'll swing by, pick you up.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.306
Copy that.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.474
So, um, speaking
of the influence

12:21.508 --> 12:23.844
that Dr. Curtis has had on you,

12:23.877 --> 12:26.980
I hope he's not forcing your
hand on the baby name front.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.850
Since when can Toby
force my hand on anything?

12:29.883 --> 12:31.484
He got you to marry him.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.085
Touché.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.153
You know, I'm just saying,

12:33.186 --> 12:38.125
that history has had
its share of exemplary Walters.

12:38.158 --> 12:41.028
Milwaukee North Side Strangler:
Walter Ellis.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.496
Sir Walter Raleigh, founder
of the doomed colony of Roanoke,

12:43.530 --> 12:46.166
and, of course, Walter Mondale.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.835
What's wrong with Mondale?

12:47.868 --> 12:49.569
He lost 49 out of 50 states.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.505
So, if you want your kid
to grow up to be a loser,

12:52.539 --> 12:53.874
that's your choice.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.208
Just spread your worms.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.878
Can't. My buckets are empty.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.346
Yeah, me, too.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.881
WALTER:
Okay.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.050
Let's let these guys feast
and clean the Pacific.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.217
Paige, we're done.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.253
Come get us.
Okay. On our way.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.554
(engine stalling)

13:10.090 --> 13:12.893
Uh, we got a little bit
of a problem.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.561
The engine doesn't seem
to want to turn over.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.296
There's no "seem"
when it comes to engines.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.198
Either they work or they don't.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.499
Then we're dealing
with a "don't" situation,

13:19.532 --> 13:20.300
because the fuel is high,

13:20.333 --> 13:21.534
there's-there's
no warning lights.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.535
Just sounds really angry.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.839
Thank you for the high-end
diagnostic.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.875
But there's got
to be a reason...

13:27.908 --> 13:28.842
Walt?

13:28.876 --> 13:31.879
We got a problem.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.249
FLORENCE:
Those are men o' war.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.550
There's thousands of them.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.419
I believe the plural
is "man of wars."

13:39.452 --> 13:40.387
HAPPY:
Whatever they are,

13:40.420 --> 13:42.089
they are caught in the works
of the anchor

13:42.122 --> 13:43.957
and the engine's water intake.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.926
That's why the boat is dead.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.427
Are they eating the trash?

13:47.460 --> 13:49.863
No. Jellyfish don't eat garbage.

13:49.897 --> 13:52.265
If they did, we wouldn't
have brought worms.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.467
It's not the garbage
that they're eating,

13:54.501 --> 13:55.568
it's the binding agent.

13:55.602 --> 13:56.536
What'd you put in the solution?

13:56.569 --> 14:00.273
Agar, various proteins,
copepods, rotifers.

14:00.307 --> 14:01.641
Copepods
and rotifers?

14:01.674 --> 14:03.076
Building blocks for zooplankton.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.444
It's the snack of choice
for jellyfish.

14:04.477 --> 14:05.879
How did you not think of that?

14:05.913 --> 14:07.180
Because I am a chemist,

14:07.214 --> 14:08.548
not a zoologist.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.550
So why didn't you think to ask?

14:10.583 --> 14:12.185
Doesn't matter
whose fault it is.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.353
Kind of matters.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.287
Point is,

14:14.321 --> 14:15.588
we can't start the engine

14:15.622 --> 14:17.190
until we clear out
the jellyfish.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.192
Clear out the super-poisonous,
deadly jellyfish?

14:19.226 --> 14:20.460
Sounds simple.

14:20.493 --> 14:21.361
FLORENCE:
Great.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.963
There's no signal out here.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.264
Okay. I-I'll radio
the Coast Guard.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.665
HAPPY:
Better get here fast,

14:25.698 --> 14:27.600
'cause we just dropped
a thousand plastic-eating worms

14:27.634 --> 14:29.903
on this island, and in 90
minutes, it'll disintegrate,

14:29.937 --> 14:31.604
and we'll be in the water
getting stung to death.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.674
Actually, man o' war stings
are toxic, not lethal.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.309
How about a hundred of them?

14:36.343 --> 14:37.477
Totally lethal.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.980
Well, the bloom has doubled
since we've been talking.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.081
They can do more than double.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.516
Blooms can grow dozens
of miles long.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.386
So by the time
the Coast Guard gets here,

14:46.419 --> 14:47.654
they'll have to
anchor 12 miles out

14:47.687 --> 14:51.091
and row to us, by which time, we
will definitely be in the water.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.393
Once again,
getting stung to death.

14:53.426 --> 14:57.197
I am so glad
you came along today, Flo.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.541
Worms must have been starving
'cause this garbage raft

15:08.575 --> 15:11.311
is decaying faster
than anticipated.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.412
SYLVESTER:
More bad news.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.581
The Coast Guard is hours away.

15:14.614 --> 15:15.648
We don't have hours.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.684
That's the first correct thing
you've said today.

15:17.717 --> 15:20.287
I have a potential,
yet stressful, solution.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.721
Uh, we connect two ropes

15:21.754 --> 15:23.323
to form a bridge

15:23.356 --> 15:25.058
between the garbage island
and our boat.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.727
Your fix is to make us swing
over deadly sea creatures?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.629
How are we supposed to get
the rope all the way to them?

15:29.662 --> 15:31.564
Harpoon gun.
Harpoon gun.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.167
I spotted it earlier, when we
were loading gear in the cabin.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.569
Fairly certain I saw it first.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.675
I think this just might work.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.344
(plastic cracking)

15:44.377 --> 15:46.746
HAPPY: Okay, Sly?
Hurry and launch that rope!

15:46.779 --> 15:49.316
This thing is cracking
under our feet!

15:54.754 --> 15:57.057
Ugh. Cabe, you mind hitting that

15:57.090 --> 15:58.191
with some cleanser?

15:58.225 --> 15:59.659
I'm wrist-deep
in chowder over here.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.231
Sure.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.266
(cabinet opens)

16:10.303 --> 16:11.371
(Cabe sighs)

16:22.482 --> 16:23.416
You okay?

16:23.450 --> 16:25.752
Yeah, I'm-I'm fine, I...

16:27.787 --> 16:30.423
I'm gonna get a pan
for the turkey.

16:39.132 --> 16:43.303
Patient exhibits strong reaction
to olfactory memory trigger.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.272
Moving on to second phase
of testing.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.706
(recorder beeps)

16:46.739 --> 16:48.541
PAIGE: Are you ready
to launch that thing or what?

16:48.575 --> 16:51.711
Just calculating the trajectory
of the harpoon.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.746
I need to be seven more inches
off the ground

16:53.780 --> 16:54.847
in order
to achieve the angle

16:54.881 --> 16:57.617
necessary to securely plant
the harpoon on the island.

16:57.650 --> 16:58.685
This thing's about seven inches.

16:59.752 --> 17:00.687
My tome?

17:00.720 --> 17:01.821
Just stand on the damn thing.

17:01.854 --> 17:05.725
J. Randall P. Smythe,
forgive me.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.629
By the fire of Klentoria!

17:15.768 --> 17:16.836
(grunts)

17:16.869 --> 17:18.505
Seems sturdy.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.672
Good work, Sly.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.241
Thanks, but we won't know
for sure

17:21.274 --> 17:22.775
until someone's
actually on it, though.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.245
I'll just put you up here

17:25.278 --> 17:27.114
for safekeeping.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.482
Lots of lethal
planktonic invertebrates

17:29.516 --> 17:30.683
down there.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.086
So, who wants to go first?

17:33.120 --> 17:34.421
I'll go.

17:34.454 --> 17:35.788
Oh, sure, yeah.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.425
The person who caused the
predicament should absolutely

17:38.458 --> 17:39.759
be the first one to safety.

17:39.792 --> 17:40.793
It's pretty gutsy.

17:40.827 --> 17:44.431
If this thing doesn't hold,
she's the test dummy.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.500
Suppose you're right.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.836
The wind is pretty
unpredictable,

17:49.869 --> 17:51.838
so keep the space in between
your hands equidistant

17:51.871 --> 17:54.441
on each swing to prevent
stability loss.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.642
That is apparent.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.144
Thank you.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.647
I hope you have the requisite
upper body strength

18:00.680 --> 18:02.182
to make it across.

18:02.215 --> 18:05.518
I think ten years of Tae Bo
has prepared me well.

18:05.552 --> 18:09.689
Well, I focus my time
on research, not athletics.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.126
Yes.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.531
(grunts)

18:25.738 --> 18:27.807
Strong little monkey.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.777
Yeah. Well, she focuses
on athletics, not research.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.345
Well, she's a strong
little monkey.

18:32.379 --> 18:33.813
Okay, come on. We got you.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.882
(grunting)

18:35.915 --> 18:38.185
Okay.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.852
(rope creaking)
Oh, boy.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.788
SYLVESTER:
The current's pulling back out.

18:41.821 --> 18:42.822
The rope doesn't have
the tensile strength

18:42.855 --> 18:43.856
to take on much strain!

18:43.890 --> 18:45.525
Guys, get across now!

18:45.558 --> 18:46.793
I'll hold it steady. You go.

18:46.826 --> 18:47.727
But then you'll have
to go on your own.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.396
You don't have the best
balance, you know?

18:49.429 --> 18:52.165
I focus my time on research,
not athletics.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.466
Okay. Snippy.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.667
Sheesh.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.942
Whoa, Nellie!

19:02.975 --> 19:04.544
Hold on! Hold on!

19:05.778 --> 19:07.614
I don't think
the rope's gonna hold.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.683
Oh, forget the rope.

19:10.717 --> 19:11.884
The harpoon's
being pulled out!

19:11.918 --> 19:12.719
HAPPY:
Walt,

19:12.752 --> 19:15.154
if that harpoon pops,
I'm a goner!

19:16.223 --> 19:18.325
(screams)

19:18.358 --> 19:19.792
I can't hold on!

19:19.826 --> 19:20.893
I'm turning back.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.729
I think the harpoon's
coming out!

19:23.796 --> 19:25.398
The harpoon
is definitely coming out.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.399
Happy, hurry!

19:35.442 --> 19:36.509
The harpoon punctured the hull.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.677
We're taking
on water.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.989
When the harpoon snapped off,

19:50.022 --> 19:52.392
it took a hunk
of plastic with it.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.560
Made the hole worse.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.761
Thank you for the play-by-play.

19:54.794 --> 19:55.995
I'd always hoped to die
fully informed.

19:56.028 --> 19:56.996
PAIGE: All right,
I'm radioing

19:57.029 --> 19:58.731
the Coast Guard to get
an ETA on their arrival.

19:58.765 --> 19:59.866
Not possible.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.269
The harpoon cut the telecom hub.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.703
FLORENCE:
Great, so there's no radio

20:03.736 --> 20:04.804
and no cell service.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.072
And the yahoos in the garage

20:06.105 --> 20:08.441
won't have their comms in until
Cabe's therapy is wrapped up,

20:08.475 --> 20:09.876
so we can't get to them
for help.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.478
Not necessarily.

20:11.511 --> 20:12.779
Just 'cause they don't
have them in,

20:12.812 --> 20:14.247
doesn't mean they can't hear us.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.815
How are they supposed to hear us
over their comms

20:15.848 --> 20:17.650
if they're not wearing them?
They're not bats.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.352
SYLVESTER:
Actually, moths have

20:19.386 --> 20:21.388
better hearing than bats,
but I totally get your point.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.323
Who the hell cares?
Walter, I'm not about to sink

20:23.356 --> 20:25.358
out here with these nerds.
What's your plan?

20:25.392 --> 20:27.360
WALTER: We manipulate
the comm's microwave frequencies

20:27.394 --> 20:28.928
to send a high-pitch signal.

20:28.961 --> 20:30.863
You'll need to manipulate
the transmitter.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.499
I can use a paper clip.

20:32.532 --> 20:33.633
Great idea,
but the water rushing in

20:33.666 --> 20:34.834
won't wait for the Coast Guard.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.403
HAPPY:
So, plug the hole.

20:36.436 --> 20:39.306
No clue how,
so don't ask for a follow-up.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.841
Okay, okay, I can
synthesize a polymer

20:41.874 --> 20:43.543
using the plastic
from the harpoon,

20:43.576 --> 20:45.545
boiled together with the
unvulcanized rubber sealant

20:45.578 --> 20:46.679
from the hull.

20:46.713 --> 20:47.880
Let's get cooking.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.282
Okay.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.322
Um, boss?

20:55.355 --> 20:56.656
Are we gonna ignore

20:56.689 --> 20:57.824
the jellyfish in the room?

20:57.857 --> 20:59.025
They can fix the boat
all they want,

20:59.058 --> 21:02.762
but we can't fix this plastic
craptastic barge we're on.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.664
Well, once they get in touch
with Toby and Cabe,

21:04.697 --> 21:06.032
they'll get help. Until then,

21:06.065 --> 21:08.835
I'm confident in the
seaworthiness of this thing...

21:08.868 --> 21:10.437
(yelps)

21:10.470 --> 21:11.871
Okay, we're dead if we
don't get off this thing.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.139
The worms are starting
to eat right through it.

21:13.172 --> 21:16.609
We just need to figure out a way
to swim without getting stung.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.077
Perhaps Groucho Marx
glasses.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.012
They'll never recognize us.

21:20.046 --> 21:20.980
Disguise.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.515
E-Exactly.

21:22.549 --> 21:24.083
The jellyfish hunt

21:24.116 --> 21:26.986
via taste and smell, so if we
mimic their biological makeup,

21:27.019 --> 21:28.988
then they'll think
that we're jellyfish, too,

21:29.021 --> 21:30.056
and ignore us.

21:30.089 --> 21:33.526
Sly, we'll need your
fish oil-based protein shake.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.794
My lunch?

21:34.827 --> 21:36.095
WALTER: If we denature
the shake proteins

21:36.128 --> 21:38.365
with sea salt that's
collected on the plastic,

21:38.398 --> 21:40.099
we'll be able to mimic
the proteins

21:40.132 --> 21:42.335
in the bells of the jellyfish.

21:42.369 --> 21:43.870
We'll baste up
like a couple of turkeys

21:43.903 --> 21:45.405
and swim past the jellies.

21:45.438 --> 21:46.906
But my lunch is here.

21:46.939 --> 21:48.741
(gasps)
The pumpkin chucker.

21:48.775 --> 21:51.010
We have extra plastic balls

21:51.043 --> 21:52.111
from when we launched
the binding agent.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.746
We can fill them
with my protein shake.

21:53.780 --> 21:56.082
Paige, I will talk you through
modifying the launcher

21:56.115 --> 21:58.385
so it can properly toss
Sly's lunch.

21:58.418 --> 21:59.185
Really?

21:59.218 --> 22:01.020
Could you people be
any less mature?

22:01.053 --> 22:01.988
I'm headed topside.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.991
Oh, and we could be
infinitely less mature.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.058
Happy could've
easily said

22:06.092 --> 22:07.360
it's time to launch Sly's balls,

22:07.394 --> 22:08.060
but she didn't.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.398
Hmm.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.903
Look at that golden beauty,
Doc, huh?

22:16.936 --> 22:19.606
Staying back, doing the cooking.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.073
What better way
to spend a day?

22:21.107 --> 22:22.775
Doesn't mean it can't
be made better

22:22.809 --> 22:24.377
with some
popcorn, right?

22:26.112 --> 22:27.113
(corn kernels popping)

22:28.948 --> 22:30.082
Oh!

22:30.116 --> 22:31.684
(kernels continue popping)

22:31.718 --> 22:32.952
You all right, hombre?

22:32.985 --> 22:34.754
Yeah.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.423
Yeah, that popping startled me.

22:36.456 --> 22:39.025
Never considered popcorn
one of the scarier snack foods.

22:39.058 --> 22:41.728
What about that sound
threw you off guard?

22:43.463 --> 22:46.399
(erratic whistling sound)

22:46.433 --> 22:47.934
What the hell is that?

22:47.967 --> 22:50.537
It's coming
from over there.

22:50.570 --> 22:53.473
(whistling sound continues)

22:56.543 --> 22:57.510
What's your problem?

22:57.544 --> 22:59.946
Toby! Cabe!

22:59.979 --> 23:01.448
Mayday! Mayday!

23:01.481 --> 23:02.482
What the hell?

23:02.515 --> 23:04.984
Cabe, put in the comm.

23:05.017 --> 23:06.619
What's going on?
SYLVESTER:
Ship sinking!

23:06.653 --> 23:07.620
Jellyfish bloom!

23:07.654 --> 23:08.455
Walter and Happy trapped

23:08.488 --> 23:09.856
on a disintegrating
trash island!

23:09.889 --> 23:11.791
The radio is broken,

23:11.824 --> 23:14.060
Coast Guard is too far off,
and we need help!

23:14.093 --> 23:16.729
Give me the coordinates,
I'll start making calls.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.482
PAIGE:
Okay,

23:35.515 --> 23:36.883
getting ready.

23:36.916 --> 23:37.750
Oh, boy.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.519
The boat is taking on
a lot of water!

23:39.552 --> 23:41.554
Okay, Florence, ETA on the goop?

23:41.588 --> 23:42.689
Once it liquefies.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.023
ETA on the liquefying?

23:44.056 --> 23:45.224
When it's good and ready,

23:45.257 --> 23:47.994
and no amount of questioning is
going to speed that along.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.497
You're stressed.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.363
That's understandable.

23:51.397 --> 23:52.665
This is your first
Scorpion disaster.

23:52.699 --> 23:54.734
We're used to it.
FLORENCE: How do you know
that I'm stressed?

23:54.767 --> 23:56.235
Maybe this is how I normally act

23:56.268 --> 23:59.238
when I'm synthesizing a polymer
on a sinking ship.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.740
I assume

24:00.773 --> 24:02.975
you apply polymer
on strips of cloth,

24:03.009 --> 24:04.944
like papier-mâché.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.147
That would be correct.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.916
Okay. I will get to work
on that.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.584
I'll ballast the boat.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.820
Maybe a shift
in the weight

24:13.853 --> 24:15.087
will bring the hole
out of the water.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.123
Just working in a kitchen.

24:17.156 --> 24:18.791
Standard Thanksgiving, right?

24:18.825 --> 24:20.593
I'm not feeling very thankful.

24:20.627 --> 24:21.460
And I know that
you're just trying

24:21.494 --> 24:22.962
to take my mind
off of the situation.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.964
I am. Because
I know working with

24:24.997 --> 24:26.599
a team of geniuses
can be trying.
(short laugh)

24:26.633 --> 24:28.000
I'm seriously starting to doubt

24:28.034 --> 24:30.503
that anyone on this
team is a genius.

24:30.537 --> 24:33.940
Excuse me, but a genius
would have done the math

24:33.973 --> 24:35.675
to know that your product
is jellyfish bait.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.009
So, one, this is your fault.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.145
And two, I am trying
to be nice to you,

24:39.178 --> 24:41.581
but I draw the line
at you badmouthing my nerds.

24:42.314 --> 24:42.949
HAPPY (over comm):
Sly?

24:42.982 --> 24:44.551
What's going on over there?

24:44.584 --> 24:46.819
Ladies are fighting.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.956
This predicament is not
the fault of my product--

24:49.989 --> 24:52.625
which, by the way,
is working like gangbusters.

24:52.659 --> 24:53.826
That plastic bound together

24:53.860 --> 24:55.562
faster than any of you
could calculate.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.864
Oh, oh, I didn't see
the Nobel Prize committee.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.766
Maybe they're stuck in
the quadrillion jellyfish

24:59.799 --> 25:00.933
you attracted!

25:00.967 --> 25:04.103
Oh, okay.
Sorry, Miss... Perfect.

25:04.136 --> 25:05.538
What?

25:05.572 --> 25:06.806
Oh, please.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.308
The hot mom with the genius kid,
dating the boss.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.812
It's super easy to criticize
when you've had it easy.

25:12.845 --> 25:16.248
I built a successful
company out of nothing.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.217
Then one lousy quarter

25:18.250 --> 25:19.952
and the shareholders
just voted me out.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.287
And now I'm clawing my way back

25:21.320 --> 25:23.189
and I will not allow
the bad luck

25:23.222 --> 25:25.257
of being Scorpion's neighbor
to derail me.

25:25.291 --> 25:28.828
I will also not allow
someone to insult

25:28.861 --> 25:31.063
my work after everything
that I've put into it.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.599
What do you even know

25:32.632 --> 25:34.133
about-about breaking your back

25:34.166 --> 25:36.002
to make it on your own?

25:36.035 --> 25:37.704
Someone's about to get schooled.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.773
Let me tell you
how easy I've had it.

25:40.807 --> 25:41.774
I'm a single mom.

25:41.808 --> 25:43.142
My son and I have lived
in rat-infested motels,

25:43.175 --> 25:44.143
cold water apartments,

25:44.176 --> 25:46.245
and, for one week
when he was three, my car.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.815
I've had my butt grabbed
by every creep in L.A.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.583
who thinks my ass comes
with the blue plate special.

25:50.617 --> 25:52.184
And I insulted
your work

25:52.218 --> 25:53.586
because you put
my team in jeopardy,

25:53.620 --> 25:55.221
and I wanted to hurt
your feelings

25:55.254 --> 25:57.089
because you're being a jerk.

25:57.123 --> 25:59.592
(liquid bubbling)

26:00.727 --> 26:02.962
I believe we have liquification.

26:05.632 --> 26:09.902
Oh, there's a
lot of jellyfish.

26:09.936 --> 26:13.172
Staring at them won't tell us
if this slop will protect us.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.374
You're right.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.743
Shove your arm in.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.611
You're the boss.
You shove your arm in.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.212
The fact that you admitted
that I'm the boss

26:20.246 --> 26:22.148
means that you should
shove your arm in.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.183
This trash-raft
is crumbling under us.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.085
We're gonna be filled
with venom in five minutes

26:26.118 --> 26:28.354
if this doesn't work,
so shove your damn arm in!

26:31.423 --> 26:33.626
I don't know how Toby does it.

26:46.305 --> 26:47.406
Not a sting.
Not even a tickle.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.675
For now.

26:48.708 --> 26:49.709
The water's movement will start

26:49.742 --> 26:50.943
washing off this gunk

26:50.977 --> 26:52.111
as soon as we're wet;

26:52.144 --> 26:54.346
we'll be without protection
in less than ten minutes.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.282
Then we'll swim fast.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.317
Gonna be hard for a guy who
didn't focus on athletics.

27:05.024 --> 27:07.359
SYLVESTER:
That'll raise the hole
a bit out of the water.

27:07.393 --> 27:08.761
Water will still slosh
into the boat,

27:08.795 --> 27:09.762
but at a slower rate,

27:09.796 --> 27:12.899
so... we're still sinking.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.033
Sealant is done.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.735
Now all we have to do is
lower it to Happy and Walter.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.369
Lower it? We can just
patch it right here.

27:17.403 --> 27:18.304
If we patch it on the inside,

27:18.337 --> 27:20.206
the water pressure
will make it pop out.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.340
But if we patch it
on the outside,

27:21.373 --> 27:24.010
the water pressure will compress
the patch to the hull,

27:24.043 --> 27:25.011
making it stronger.

27:25.044 --> 27:26.178
You hear that, Walt, Happy?

27:26.212 --> 27:27.413
You're going to work.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.332
Came here to get plastic
out of the ocean,

27:46.365 --> 27:47.867
now we're lowering tar into it.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.306
I am a skilled chemist...

27:54.340 --> 27:56.042
but I am not a biologist.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.911
So, it's outside my
scope of expertise

27:58.945 --> 28:01.047
to know that my product
would attract the jellyfish.

28:03.349 --> 28:07.954
Probably should've thought of
that before offering it up.

28:10.022 --> 28:13.125
I'm responsible for us
being in this situation.

28:13.159 --> 28:15.795
This is my attempt
at an apology.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.866
And this is my
acceptance of it.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.404
HAPPY: Get that junk that
they've lowered down

28:25.437 --> 28:27.073
and I'll grab that rope
out of the hole.

28:35.347 --> 28:36.315
We really don't have
time for this.

28:36.348 --> 28:37.984
The jellyfish

28:38.017 --> 28:39.819
will know soon enough
that we are not one of them.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.153
If we don't patch the hole,

28:41.187 --> 28:42.755
we're just climbing
onto a sinking ship.

28:42.789 --> 28:43.823
But we should work fast,

28:43.856 --> 28:45.925
because I can feel them
getting curious down there.

28:47.193 --> 28:49.428
This stuff is working
like a charm!

28:49.461 --> 28:50.529
How fast does it seal?

28:50.562 --> 28:53.232
Within seconds of application.

28:53.265 --> 28:55.267
This is good stuff.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.903
Nice work, Flo.
FLORENCE:
Thank you.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.370
It's Florence.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.972
HAPPY:
Whoa!

29:00.006 --> 29:01.440
Big swell!

29:04.276 --> 29:06.112
Finish quickly, please. The
jellies aren't fooled anymore.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.114
Aah! Aah...

29:08.147 --> 29:09.415
I think I just got stung.

29:09.448 --> 29:10.850
Aah!

29:10.883 --> 29:12.384
Oh, okay, me, too.
(grunts)

29:12.418 --> 29:14.420
Okay.
I'm done.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.288
Another swell...

29:16.322 --> 29:17.356
hold on.

29:21.861 --> 29:22.795
Whoa...

29:22.829 --> 29:24.230
(shrieks)

29:24.263 --> 29:25.264
Florence!

29:32.571 --> 29:34.540
(gasping)

29:34.573 --> 29:37.143
Help... me! Aah!

29:37.176 --> 29:38.477
You get on the boat!

29:38.510 --> 29:39.946
I'll grab Florence!

29:43.115 --> 29:44.183
Happy!

29:44.216 --> 29:46.085
Grab the ladder! Hurry!

29:48.487 --> 29:50.289
(sputtering)

29:50.322 --> 29:51.290
Aah!

29:51.323 --> 29:53.292
You know, I've never really

29:53.325 --> 29:54.961
watched Walter swim before.

29:54.994 --> 29:57.296
He focuses on research,
not athletics.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.431
TOBY (over comm):
Walt, if she's getting
repeatedly stung,

29:59.465 --> 30:02.068
you've got about ten seconds
before she goes into shock.

30:02.101 --> 30:04.136
(gasping)

30:04.170 --> 30:06.105
She's going under!

30:11.177 --> 30:12.411
Hold on.

30:12.444 --> 30:13.612
I got you.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.115
(panting)

30:16.148 --> 30:17.583
Thank you.

30:17.616 --> 30:18.885
You okay?
My leg.

30:18.918 --> 30:19.852
One bad sting.

30:19.886 --> 30:21.187
TOBY:
The boat should have

30:21.220 --> 30:22.254
a freshwater line.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.056
Hose down her leg
and then saturate the other two

30:24.090 --> 30:25.091
once they're on the deck.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.262
Hey! (groans)

30:30.296 --> 30:32.531
Guys?
I don't think Walt's fish goop

30:32.564 --> 30:34.033
is helping much anymore.

30:34.066 --> 30:36.903
Cabe, if they don't get
Flo to a hospital fast,

30:36.936 --> 30:37.970
she could go into
full anaphylaxis and die.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.171
Where's the ride?

30:39.205 --> 30:40.372
It's not like
I'm ordering a pizza.

30:40.406 --> 30:41.573
They're in the middle
of the ocean.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.075
I'm pulling every string I can.

30:43.109 --> 30:45.077
Then pull more!
(timer dings)

30:47.146 --> 30:48.514
(dings)

30:48.547 --> 30:49.515
TOBY:
Cabe?

30:49.548 --> 30:50.983
Cabe!

30:51.017 --> 30:52.084
Where'd you just go?

30:52.118 --> 30:53.452
Uh, no... nowhere.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.621
Uh, sh-shut up, I'm fine.

30:57.323 --> 30:58.590
(grunts)

31:04.964 --> 31:05.932
PAIGE:
Oh, my God.

31:05.965 --> 31:08.134
She has stings all over her.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.203
I'm gonna spray them down!

31:11.237 --> 31:13.105
Get off any bits of tentacles.

31:13.139 --> 31:14.173
Those can sting even after

31:14.206 --> 31:15.207
they've detached
from the jellyfish.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.179
Aah!

31:21.280 --> 31:22.214
And find vinegar.

31:22.248 --> 31:23.315
I'll check the galley.

31:25.651 --> 31:27.987
Florence? Florence!

31:28.020 --> 31:29.588
Florence! Toby,

31:29.621 --> 31:31.190
she's in trouble.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.258
Her breathing's labored

31:32.291 --> 31:34.026
and she's pale, unresponsive.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.394
TOBY:
Just pour the vinegar on her.
(wheezing)

31:35.427 --> 31:37.163
Wrap her in blankets
to keep her warm.

31:38.030 --> 31:38.965
I'll get blankets!

31:38.998 --> 31:40.266
Vinegar.

31:42.168 --> 31:44.536
Florence, stay with me.

31:49.241 --> 31:50.142
SYLVESTER:
You have multiple stings;

31:50.176 --> 31:51.577
you need to save
some of that for yourself.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.079
She needs it more than I do.

31:53.112 --> 31:54.046
CABE:
All right, I got a buddy

31:54.080 --> 31:56.115
out of Pendleton that
flies a medevac chopper.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.649
She doesn't have enough fuel
to get there and back,

31:57.683 --> 31:59.218
but if they meet her
ten miles east,

31:59.251 --> 32:00.386
she can get to the hospital.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.288
We can't move an inch east!

32:02.321 --> 32:04.123
Jellyfish have clogged
our engines!

32:04.156 --> 32:06.358
Maybe we won't have
the jellyfish to deal with.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.194
Cabe, give us the coordinates

32:08.227 --> 32:09.695
that we need to reach;
Sly, chart the course.

32:09.728 --> 32:12.431
CABE: Chopper's gonna be
at 192 degrees north

32:12.464 --> 32:14.266
by 87 degrees west

32:14.300 --> 32:16.268
in 24 minutes.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.437
She has enough time to hover
and pick them up,

32:18.470 --> 32:20.706
but if you're not there,
she turns for base.

32:20.739 --> 32:23.042
Walter, how do you plan,
exactly, to get this boat going?

32:23.075 --> 32:24.376
We need to light
the ocean on fire.

32:24.410 --> 32:27.213
Douse the area
around the engine with fuel.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.148
It'll light right above the
jellyfish and scare 'em off.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.183
Letting us get the engines
to full speed,

32:31.217 --> 32:33.385
provided we don't
blow up the boat.
That is s risk.

32:33.419 --> 32:34.320
Do it fast.

32:34.353 --> 32:36.188
Your patient doesn't have
any more time.

32:36.222 --> 32:37.623
Sly, Walt, fuel drum.

32:38.490 --> 32:39.658
Okay.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.461
First we dump tar
into the ocean,

32:42.494 --> 32:44.063
and now we are dumping fuel.

32:44.096 --> 32:46.165
Greater good.
If we save Florence,

32:46.198 --> 32:47.399
she'll do more to
preserve the environment

32:47.433 --> 32:50.169
with her scientific work than
the damage that we're doing

32:50.202 --> 32:51.237
right now in this moment.

32:53.239 --> 32:54.540
Don't tell her I told you that.

32:57.043 --> 32:58.344
You think this is gonna
be enough?

32:58.377 --> 33:00.179
Only one way
to find out.

33:00.212 --> 33:02.481
Happy, need your Zippo.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.053
Now, get back in the
cabin and get ready.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.188
Oh, Happy, if I ignite,

33:09.221 --> 33:11.057
will you tell baby Walena
I was a hero?

33:11.090 --> 33:12.191
It's never gonna happen.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.293
What, me igniting, or you
naming the baby after me?

33:14.326 --> 33:16.528
Don't make me choose.

33:18.364 --> 33:20.066
Okay.

33:20.099 --> 33:22.068
How will we know if it worked?

33:22.101 --> 33:25.171
If we don't explode.
Walt, light it up.

33:38.417 --> 33:39.451
Happy, the flames are
against the side of the boat.

33:39.485 --> 33:42.321
We have to get out of here.

33:42.354 --> 33:43.822
You heard him.

33:43.855 --> 33:44.623
I need to make sure
that the jellies

33:44.656 --> 33:46.792
move away from the engine.
When?!

33:46.825 --> 33:48.527
Now. She's not doing well.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.796
Happy, start the damn engine!

33:50.829 --> 33:52.164
Happy!

33:52.198 --> 33:53.832
(engine stalling)

33:53.865 --> 33:55.734
Uh, she's not turning over.
This is not happening.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.770
Happy, the boat's
starting to burn.

33:59.805 --> 34:03.275
This was supposed to be
my vacation day!

34:03.309 --> 34:05.477
(engine starts)
Okay, hold tight.

34:07.513 --> 34:09.615
(engine revving)

34:11.483 --> 34:13.485
We'll have you on a medevac
in just a few minutes, okay?

34:13.519 --> 34:15.387
Just hold on.

34:26.698 --> 34:28.667
Okay, glad to hear.

34:30.169 --> 34:32.471
Florence has made
a full recovery.

34:32.504 --> 34:33.739
Hospital's releasing her.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.574
Great news.
I'll go pick her up.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.409
Okay.
More great news.

34:37.443 --> 34:39.845
Satellite images show
the garbage island

34:39.878 --> 34:42.281
is almost fully dissolved.

34:42.314 --> 34:44.216
I won't wear this apron, and
I really should not be the one

34:44.250 --> 34:45.217
checking on the food.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.519
I don't cook, I reheat.

34:47.553 --> 34:48.854
I'll finish up the turkey,

34:48.887 --> 34:51.190
but could you please
keep it down?

34:51.223 --> 34:52.524
(whispering):
They're still in the trailer.

34:52.558 --> 34:55.494
Right. Forgot.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.463
(whispering):
Doctor is in.

34:57.496 --> 34:59.531
TOBY: Bunch of things
sent you into space today.

34:59.565 --> 35:01.767
One time during a very
critical moment in the case.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.135
You want that to happen again?

35:03.169 --> 35:06.405
It was a momentary lapse.
No, it wasn't.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.706
You know that.

35:07.739 --> 35:09.475
You're having memory triggers.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.543
I think you're
starting to remember

35:11.577 --> 35:13.612
what really happened
the night your father died.

35:13.645 --> 35:15.814
I told you what
really happened.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.349
What was that, again?

35:17.383 --> 35:20.452
Damn it, Doc,
the-the cops came to the door

35:20.486 --> 35:21.720
and they gave us the news.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.855
And then your mom
stopped her mopping.

35:23.889 --> 35:26.658
There was popcorn
popping, and what else?

35:26.692 --> 35:28.794
Why does there have to
always be something else?

35:28.827 --> 35:31.697
My mom, she took care of me.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.699
She hugged me,
she told me

35:33.732 --> 35:35.301
everything was
gonna be okay.

35:35.334 --> 35:37.769
She put some calamine
lotion on my neck...

35:37.803 --> 35:39.571
You hadn't mentioned
that before.

35:39.605 --> 35:41.307
Why'd she put calamine
lotion on your neck?

35:41.340 --> 35:43.875
'Cause of the blanket
that the cops gave me.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.445
It was... it was wool,
and I had a reaction to it.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.946
Why did the cops
give you a blanket?

35:47.979 --> 35:49.748
Because it was cold that night.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.650
Well, you were in your house.

35:52.818 --> 35:57.656
Right.
I was, uh...

35:57.689 --> 36:00.226
I was at the house, uh...

36:00.259 --> 36:01.893
The cops must have brought me
back there afterwards.

36:01.927 --> 36:02.894
I don't know.

36:02.928 --> 36:05.431
Brought you back from where?

36:10.236 --> 36:12.538
The bodega.

36:15.807 --> 36:18.210
My God, I was at the bodega.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.326
(register rings)

36:36.662 --> 36:37.663
(echoing):
Money in the bag,
or you're dead!

36:49.741 --> 36:51.877
I froze.

36:51.910 --> 36:56.848
I was there... I saw the guy...

36:59.318 --> 37:01.453
I should have said
something sooner,

37:01.487 --> 37:04.256
and he'd still be alive.
Cabe,

37:04.290 --> 37:06.258
the only person responsible
for your father's death

37:06.292 --> 37:08.026
is the man who shot him,
not you.

37:08.059 --> 37:11.297
No, I froze.

37:11.330 --> 37:14.300
I was responsible.
You were a child.

37:14.333 --> 37:16.735
Children don't stop
men with guns.

37:16.768 --> 37:19.805
Children make up stories,
and you made up one.

37:19.838 --> 37:23.275
Perfectly popped popcorn
and wonderful pine scents,

37:23.309 --> 37:26.278
and this impossibly picturesque
loss of a father.

37:27.879 --> 37:31.317
Your story was so damn good,
you believed it as an adult.

37:32.851 --> 37:33.885
You were just trying
to protect

37:33.919 --> 37:35.787
this nine-year-old
version of you,

37:35.821 --> 37:39.591
because, deep down,
you blame yourself,

37:39.625 --> 37:42.661
because you were
only nine years old.

37:42.694 --> 37:44.963
You were nine, Cabe.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.698
So now you're 59.
Why don't you stop

37:46.732 --> 37:48.266
beating up on
that little kid?

37:53.739 --> 37:56.808
Why is all this stuff
coming up now?

37:56.842 --> 37:58.444
Why now?

37:58.477 --> 38:00.646
Because you think
if you get sent to jail,

38:00.679 --> 38:03.349
you'll be failing us, like you
think you failed your father.

38:03.382 --> 38:05.083
You think you need
to protect us,

38:05.116 --> 38:07.052
like you thought you needed
to protect your father.

38:07.085 --> 38:09.087
And that's why you haven't
been coming around much

38:09.120 --> 38:12.524
the past few weeks-- guilt.

38:13.725 --> 38:16.395
Cabe, you did not
fail your father,

38:16.428 --> 38:18.096
and you're not failing us.

38:18.129 --> 38:21.433
You've taken care of us
for a long time.

38:23.502 --> 38:26.772
Now it's time to let us
take care of you.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.376
(sighs)

38:33.579 --> 38:35.681
Hey.

38:35.714 --> 38:36.682
How'd it go?

38:36.715 --> 38:39.851
It was good.
I'm better.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.391
HAPPY:
Well, you helped
cook this slop,

38:45.424 --> 38:47.125
so your work is done here,
old man.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.861
I'll make sure, uh,
you get a drumstick.

38:51.397 --> 38:53.465
How about we
take a load off?

38:53.499 --> 38:55.033
Okay.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.038
Hey.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.107
How is he?

39:02.140 --> 39:04.576
It was a rough
therapy session,

39:04.610 --> 39:06.678
but he'll be all right.

39:06.712 --> 39:07.879
He just needs us.

39:12.884 --> 39:15.921
Oh, hey, uh,
while I have a moment...

39:15.954 --> 39:17.656
Say the word "Walena"--

39:17.689 --> 39:18.757
and it's a word,
not a name--

39:18.790 --> 39:20.659
you get yams
down your pants.

39:24.996 --> 39:27.499
Hey, I just wanted
to apologize

39:27.533 --> 39:28.867
for harping on
about the name

39:28.900 --> 39:30.702
of your future offspring.

39:30.736 --> 39:32.804
Okay.

39:32.838 --> 39:35.040
It's just, I, uh, I don't know
if I'll ever have children.

39:35.073 --> 39:37.443
It's not something
that I thought about.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.177
You know, until
Ralph came around,

39:39.210 --> 39:40.879
and then I, you know,
I thought I might not be

39:40.912 --> 39:42.548
such a terrible parent.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.015
Which is not something that's
been discussed with Paige.

39:44.049 --> 39:46.585
It's not really appropriate yet.

39:46.618 --> 39:49.455
But you and Toby,
I hired you.

39:49.488 --> 39:53.725
You wouldn't know each other
if it wasn't for me.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.994
So if you had a child,
it would just be

39:56.027 --> 39:58.664
something that I...

39:58.697 --> 40:01.066
I'd take a lot of pride in.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.768
Fine.

40:02.801 --> 40:05.937
You've touched my heart.

40:05.971 --> 40:07.606
"Walter" is on the list.

40:08.607 --> 40:09.875
Just don't tell Toby.

40:13.178 --> 40:15.146
Ralph, can you
help her to her seat?

40:15.180 --> 40:17.783
Carefully.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.757
There she is,
the chemist of the hour.

40:25.791 --> 40:26.725
How you feeling, Flo?

40:26.758 --> 40:27.993
Um, it's Florence.

40:28.026 --> 40:29.995
Uh, I-I feel tired.

40:30.028 --> 40:31.697
But I'm glad
to be alive,

40:31.730 --> 40:33.665
due to your efforts.

40:35.233 --> 40:36.935
I've said unkind things

40:36.968 --> 40:38.804
to you.

40:38.837 --> 40:41.039
They were not deserved.

40:41.072 --> 40:43.975
So I will endeavor
to be a better neighbor.

40:50.716 --> 40:51.983
What is...
What's this?

40:52.017 --> 40:55.153
New flasks, to replace
the ones I broke.

40:55.186 --> 40:57.989
Thank you.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.958
You're not the problem urchin
I thought you were.

41:01.627 --> 41:04.029
WALTER: So, while I'm glad
that she's okay,

41:04.062 --> 41:06.231
I'm still not sure about her.
Well,

41:06.264 --> 41:09.000
I'm gonna give her a chance,
and I think you should, too.

41:10.035 --> 41:11.236
HAPPY:
All right, everybody ready

41:11.269 --> 41:13.639
to shove food
in our gullets or what?

41:13.672 --> 41:14.873
TOBY:
No, no, not yet.

41:14.906 --> 41:17.976
Tradition dictates that Dad
sits at the head of the table.

41:18.009 --> 41:23.048
And, from what I've gleaned from
Norman Rockwell paintings...

41:26.785 --> 41:27.786
...he carves.

41:44.035 --> 41:47.105
I've realized recently
that I've been

41:47.138 --> 41:51.276
messing a bit with my memories.

41:51.309 --> 41:53.745
Been rewriting 'em
over the years.

41:55.981 --> 41:57.649
I'm not gonna do that anymore.

41:59.751 --> 42:01.887
And it's okay, 'cause

42:01.920 --> 42:04.890
I got a great girl

42:04.923 --> 42:08.994
and I've got great friends.

42:09.027 --> 42:11.329
No matter what
the future holds for me,

42:11.362 --> 42:15.567
I want to remember this moment
right now

42:15.601 --> 42:18.003
exactly as it is.

42:19.771 --> 42:23.041
'Cause to have you all
in my life,

42:23.074 --> 42:26.177
I am truly thankful.

42:26.211 --> 42:28.647
ALL:
Hear, hear!
