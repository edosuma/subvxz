00:04.504 --> 00:06.768
- I saw Ron Austin.
- The counterfeiter?

00:06.840 --> 00:08.535
- In Alpine Crest?
- Let's go get him!

00:08.608 --> 00:10.769
He is a slippery one,
isn't he, Michael?

00:11.878 --> 00:14.210
I have a constitutional right
to know what's going on.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.477
As soon as I know what's going on, I
promise you... You'll be the second to know.

00:17.550 --> 00:20.314
Money!
- I gotta get through! It's counterfeit!

00:20.387 --> 00:23.788
Either you find a way to detour him,
or I'll shut down the presses.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.553
- He's a Bible salesman.
- That's what keeps America great.

00:26.626 --> 00:28.560
Michael sent me.
He's in jail.

00:41.741 --> 00:46.838
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:46.913 --> 00:48.938
who does not exist.

00:59.993 --> 01:01.984
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.062 --> 01:04.587
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.664 --> 01:07.690
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:07.767 --> 01:11.328
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:17.670 --> 02:20.070
I don't know, KITT.
Maybe he slipped out the back.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.404
I'm picking up a man
who fits his description...

02:22.475 --> 02:24.409
coming out... now.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.895
Stand by, KITT. I may need
you. Of course, Michael.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.443
Get him around back.
Pick me up real quick.

03:32.011 --> 03:34.275
Here I am, Michael.
Hop in.

03:35.515 --> 03:37.449
Let's go get him!

03:37.517 --> 03:41.817
- He is a slippery one, isn't he, Michael?
- That's the word, KITT.

03:45.225 --> 03:48.251
I still don't believe it!

03:48.328 --> 03:51.786
Money! Money!
He's throwing away money!

04:02.842 --> 04:05.640
Move!

04:05.712 --> 04:08.010
I gotta get through!
It's counterfeit!

04:24.530 --> 04:26.623
Anyway, for the first time,
I had him cold.

04:26.699 --> 04:29.964
He goes in to make his contact,
he comes out with a briefcase...

04:30.036 --> 04:31.970
briefcase full of money.

04:32.038 --> 04:35.997
Then he slips out to the back side of the
hotel. I follow him. He opens the briefcase...

04:36.075 --> 04:38.202
- How do I look?
Fine.

04:38.278 --> 04:42.738
- Where's the matching handkerchief?
- Oh. There we are.

04:44.150 --> 04:46.482
Oh. KITT's rotors are overheating.

04:46.552 --> 04:49.043
I'll increase the gap
five degrees and retime.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.091
Am I interrupting something
here or what?

04:52.158 --> 04:55.525
Relax, Michael. We'll manage
to capture your counterfeiter.

04:55.595 --> 04:58.928
- Good. When?
- We'll get together immediately after my speech.

04:58.998 --> 05:03.025
My speech. Bonnie, I seem to
have misplaced my note cards.

05:03.102 --> 05:05.093
Your left pocket.
Oh.

05:05.171 --> 05:07.401
What is so important
about this speech?

05:09.008 --> 05:12.136
The Foundation is presenting an award
to the town of Alpine Crest...

05:12.211 --> 05:14.736
for the lowest
per capita crime rate in the state.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.112
Although it may seem
unlikely to you, Michael,

05:17.183 --> 05:21.620
it is barely conceivable that you may
find parts of my speech... interesting.

05:22.789 --> 05:27.123
After all, at the very worst, you
could use an hour or two of relaxation.

05:28.127 --> 05:30.857
Yeah, b...

06:31.090 --> 06:33.081
Can I buy you a drink?

06:33.159 --> 06:36.651
Uh, normally I don't accept
offers like that from strangers,

06:36.729 --> 06:39.027
but since it's lemonade,
I'll make an exception.

06:39.098 --> 06:41.032
Got it. Hi.
Hi.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.768
I'm Michael Knight.
Jobina Bruce.

06:44.837 --> 06:47.328
Nice little town
you've got around here.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.069
Yeah. Is this your first visit
to Alpine Crest?

06:50.143 --> 06:52.668
Actually, I'm just passin' through.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.077
I didn't think
places like this existed anymore.

06:55.148 --> 06:59.312
Neither did I. I came here a couple months
ago to help my aunt, and I was shocked.

06:59.385 --> 07:01.649
Hasn't changed in 12 years.

07:01.721 --> 07:03.712
What do you do?

07:03.790 --> 07:06.918
Um, I help run the local newspaper.

07:06.993 --> 07:10.292
I'd call myself a reporter, but actually,
there's not too much to report.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.191
This is Mr. Miles.
Thank you, sir.

07:17.336 --> 07:19.861
Sit down.
Well, what a turnout.

07:21.507 --> 07:23.441
You know, it's civic pride like this...

07:23.509 --> 07:25.807
that's made Alpine Crest
what it is today.

07:25.878 --> 07:27.812
Wouldn't you say so?

07:31.651 --> 07:35.178
Now, before we get to
our honored guest,

07:35.254 --> 07:38.883
I would like to turn the microphone over
to one of my favorite people,

07:38.958 --> 07:40.892
and I'm sure one of yours,

07:40.960 --> 07:43.019
Martha Haberstraw.

07:47.266 --> 07:49.200
Uh, thank you, Sheriff,

07:49.268 --> 07:51.600
and Mr. Barnswell,

07:51.671 --> 07:56.074
and thanks all of you folks
for your support and for your enthusiasm.

07:56.142 --> 08:00.670
It is my pleasure to introduce
a distinguished gentleman...

08:00.746 --> 08:05.809
who has come here
to confer an honor upon all of us.

08:05.885 --> 08:07.876
Uh, Devon Miles,

08:07.954 --> 08:11.390
from the Foundation
for Law and Government.

08:11.457 --> 08:14.449
Uh, Mr. Miles.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.789
Thank you, Mrs. Haberstraw.

08:20.867 --> 08:24.428
Sheriff, Mr. Barnswell, members of
the town council, ladies and gentlemen,

08:24.504 --> 08:26.938
the Foundation,
of which I am the director,

08:27.006 --> 08:29.873
annually presents an award...

08:29.942 --> 08:33.035
to the community
with the lowest per capita crime rate.

08:34.212 --> 08:37.273
- This year it is my honor
to bestow that award...

08:51.564 --> 08:54.465
What do you think you're doing?
Trying to catch up to an old friend.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.094
I advise you to catch up
with your friend someplace else,

08:57.169 --> 09:00.297
or else I'm gonna have to
take you in for disturbing the peace.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.206
Yeah, right.
Thanks for the advice.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.088
I'll say this for you, Michael.

09:16.155 --> 09:19.056
You have an uncanny facility
for making me forget my lines.

09:19.125 --> 09:23.323
If it hadn't been for my notes, I would have been
hopelessly lost. Devon, it wasn't intentional.

09:23.396 --> 09:27.059
Not to mention, if those people had known
that you were employed by the Foundation,

09:27.133 --> 09:29.192
they would have thrown me off the dais.

09:29.268 --> 09:31.668
Devon, I'm sorry
I spoiled your presentation,

09:31.737 --> 09:33.671
but I had a very good reason.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.502
And what, may I ask, was that?

09:35.575 --> 09:38.703
- I saw Ron Austin there.
- The counterfeiter?

09:38.778 --> 09:42.544
- In Alpine Crest? - The most
crime-free community in the state?

09:42.615 --> 09:45.516
Crime-free or not, I saw him.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.383
He may have been on his way
to Twin Falls or a bigger city,

09:48.454 --> 09:51.514
but as long as he's here,
I'm gonna give it a shot.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.916
With your permission, of course.

09:54.994 --> 09:57.019
As you say, Michael,
give it a shot.

09:58.698 --> 10:01.326
Not even a good-bye?
See you later?

10:01.400 --> 10:03.334
Aloha?

10:03.402 --> 10:06.200
Aloha.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.864
Cheers.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.464
Cheers!

10:18.618 --> 10:20.643
KITT, I need a visual on Ron Austin.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.416
Certainly, Michael.
I'll show you what I have available.

10:23.489 --> 10:25.889
That's good. Freeze.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.722
Picture perfect.
Can you give me a hard copy?

10:33.232 --> 10:35.223
How's that for service?

10:35.301 --> 10:37.269
Terrific.

10:37.336 --> 10:40.669
Wait a minute.
Are you sure this is not counterfeit?

10:40.740 --> 10:43.800
- I beg your pardon?
- Just a joke, pal.

10:56.956 --> 10:59.424
That's the guy that caused
all the trouble. Uh-huh.

11:00.559 --> 11:03.084
Excuse me, Sheriff.
Well, a familiar face.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.130
Yeah. Sorry about that.

11:05.197 --> 11:07.688
In fact, that's why I'm here.
I'm a freelance skip tracer.

11:07.767 --> 11:10.395
I've been chasing this guy
across the tristate area.

11:10.469 --> 11:13.063
You know him?

11:13.139 --> 11:16.472
No, never saw him before.
What's he wanted for?

11:16.542 --> 11:18.476
Well, he jumped bail
on an old warrant.

11:18.544 --> 11:21.308
I saw him this morning
in the crowd at the award ceremony.

11:21.380 --> 11:24.349
Oh, I find that pretty hard to believe.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.477
A fella like that in Alpine Crest? Why?

11:27.553 --> 11:30.113
I don't know.
I don't either.

11:30.189 --> 11:33.249
Well, I'll keep an eye out for him,
pass the word on to my deputies,

11:33.325 --> 11:35.589
but I wouldn't get any hopes up
if I were you.

11:35.661 --> 11:38.027
Sorry.
Can't ask for more than that.

11:38.097 --> 11:40.361
Mm-hmm.
Thanks for your time, huh?

11:51.210 --> 11:54.771
Boy, I don't believe this place.
It's like it's frozen out of the '50s.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.940
I keep expecting to see
Wally and the Beaver.

11:57.016 --> 12:00.144
"Wally and the Beaver"?
That doesn't compute, Michael.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.744
Are they a part
of the counterfeit operation?

12:02.822 --> 12:05.791
No.

12:05.858 --> 12:07.849
Just part of my past, KITT.

12:10.229 --> 12:15.292
Michael, we've covered every block
in Alpine Crest 2.7 times.

12:15.367 --> 12:18.359
I think it's reasonable
to assume Mr. Austin is,

12:18.437 --> 12:20.837
as the saying goes, long gone.

12:20.906 --> 12:24.000
I wish I could argue with you, pal,

12:24.076 --> 12:26.010
but I think you're right.

12:55.341 --> 12:57.866
Michael.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.070
Hi, Jobina.
Uh, I'll be back.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.942
Hi.
Hi.

13:04.016 --> 13:05.950
Can I buy you a drink?

13:06.018 --> 13:07.952
Yeah. How about a beer?

13:08.020 --> 13:11.820
Good. Uh, Christy, bring the
man a beer, please. Thanks.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.121
Well, this is a surprise.

13:14.193 --> 13:18.095
Um, the way you took off all of a
sudden, I never expected to see you again.

13:18.164 --> 13:22.498
Well, here I am. How's the
biggest story of 1983 coming?

13:22.568 --> 13:24.593
Slow. Writing is hell.

13:24.670 --> 13:28.333
"Writing is hell"?
I thought the expression is "War is hell."

13:28.407 --> 13:31.433
Obviously said by someone
who never attempted to write.

13:31.510 --> 13:34.206
So why'd you decide
to stay?

13:34.280 --> 13:38.239
Well, it's too late to drive anywhere. I thought
I'd check in, get a room, take off tomorrow.

13:38.317 --> 13:41.047
- What about you?
- It's not that simple for me.

13:42.054 --> 13:44.181
I keep waiting for my good-bye story.

13:44.256 --> 13:46.884
Good-bye story?
What's a good-bye story?

13:46.959 --> 13:49.894
That is the story that will launch me
into big-city journalism.

13:49.962 --> 13:52.931
- Aha.
- Aha.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.456
You see, I'm a little impatient, and...

13:56.535 --> 14:00.232
well, I don't want to spend 10 years as
a junior reporter on some big-city paper...

14:00.306 --> 14:03.537
before I get a chance
to cover something other than,

14:03.609 --> 14:05.770
well, the social events
or the food section.

14:05.845 --> 14:09.042
Listen to me rattle on. You
probably want to get up to your room.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.082
Well, I could use a shower.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.414
Okay. Well, listen,

14:13.485 --> 14:15.976
if you need anything,
please feel free to call me.

14:16.055 --> 14:18.023
I'll be at the office,
slaving away.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.320
Okay.

14:20.392 --> 14:23.259
Good luck.
And, uh, thanks for the beer, huh?

14:23.329 --> 14:25.320
My pleasure.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.903
Well, guess what.

14:39.979 --> 14:42.607
Knight just checked in to the hotel.

14:42.681 --> 14:46.515
Terrific. What does this mean I'm
supposed to do now? Spend the night here?

14:46.585 --> 14:48.519
Well, you got a safer place
in mind?

14:48.587 --> 14:52.785
Of all the places, this guy had to decide to
spend the night in the sleeping bag of the West.

14:52.858 --> 14:55.224
Wait a minute.
He'd have been gone this afternoon...

14:55.294 --> 14:57.660
if you hadn't taken
your little stroll through the park.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.892
Now, what is this? A hamburger?

15:00.966 --> 15:03.230
I ordered a steak.
Oh, that's too bad.

15:03.302 --> 15:06.897
I don't want to give you a hard time, but
you have to understand about my lifestyle.

15:06.972 --> 15:09.839
You see, I go first-class.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.877
I stay in the best hotels,
eat the best food.

15:11.944 --> 15:16.438
I cannot operate at my peak if I'm
sleeping in cots, eating hamburgers...

15:16.515 --> 15:19.609
and the TV... All I can get is this
crazy lady and her knitting class.

15:19.685 --> 15:22.153
Why don't you people get
a cable TV hookup?

15:22.221 --> 15:24.189
Austin, look,

15:24.256 --> 15:27.191
I don't give a damn
about your lifestyle.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.955
You just do your job,
and I'll do mine.

15:30.029 --> 15:34.625
That's fair enough. I'd say your job right now is to
see that Knight leaves Alpine Crest as soon as possible.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.601
He will.
Leave it to me.

15:37.670 --> 15:42.437
In the meantime, I want you to
do your job tomorrow... and fast.

15:42.508 --> 15:45.966
'Cause every minute you're in this town,
you disturb my lifestyle.

16:11.437 --> 16:13.371
Perfect.

16:13.439 --> 16:15.703
I'll wire a copy of this
off to Washington,

16:15.774 --> 16:19.608
and in 24 hours I'll know everything
there is to know about Michael Knight.

16:19.678 --> 16:22.841
And whatever breaks,
it's my exclusive, right?

16:22.915 --> 16:24.883
That's our agreement, isn't it?

16:24.950 --> 16:26.941
Yeah.

16:27.953 --> 16:29.887
Oh, I meant to ask you something.

16:29.955 --> 16:31.946
Why did you pick me
to work with you?

16:32.024 --> 16:35.687
I believe I explained to you
how sensitive this case is.

16:35.761 --> 16:38.491
If the C.I.A. is involved,
I know how sensitive it is,

16:38.564 --> 16:41.294
but you never told me
exactly what the case was.

16:44.970 --> 16:48.269
It involves
a terminated federal project...

16:49.274 --> 16:51.208
and counterfeit money.

16:51.276 --> 16:53.403
Counterfeit money?
Can you tell me anything else?

16:53.479 --> 16:56.812
Who are you suspicious of?
Why are you so reluctant to be seen?

16:56.882 --> 17:00.443
Look, I can't answer
those questions. Not yet.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.386
Now, your participation
in this phase is finished.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.357
Stay away from Knight.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.893
You know, I wouldn't mind
doing a little extra research.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.895
All for the good of my country,
of course.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.193
There are two rules
in this business, young lady.

17:13.265 --> 17:17.792
Rule number one is never become
involved with a potential adversary.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.464
What's rule number two?

17:20.539 --> 17:23.234
Never become involved
with a potential friend.

17:23.308 --> 17:26.209
Tough rules.
Well, it's a tough business.

17:26.278 --> 17:28.906
That's what keeps America great.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.484
Morning, KITT.

17:43.562 --> 17:46.497
Well, KITT, say good-bye
to Alpine Crest.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.760
It's such a nice, decent little town.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.859
That's what everybody says.

17:50.936 --> 17:53.734
Bet your turbo ducts
will miss the fresh air, huh?

17:53.806 --> 17:57.708
I'm specifically designed to perform
uniformly in any type of weather.

17:57.776 --> 18:01.041
Thus, fresh air is neither an advantage,
nor a disadvantage.

18:01.113 --> 18:03.911
In other words, neither rain,
nor snow, nor gloom of night...

18:03.982 --> 18:06.143
will stay you from
your appointed rounds.

18:06.218 --> 18:09.278
That was, as they say, rather poetic.

18:09.354 --> 18:11.948
Did you make it up? Nope.
Read it in the post office...

18:12.024 --> 18:13.958
underneath the mug shots.

18:14.026 --> 18:16.017
I should have known.

18:44.990 --> 18:48.585
Sheriff, this is Deputy Cole.
Knight's gone.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.164
You're missing the climax here. The knitting
lady is slipping a thing around a mannequin.

18:59.238 --> 19:01.331
Very sensuous stuff.

19:01.406 --> 19:03.533
Get your gear ready.
He's gone?

19:03.609 --> 19:05.873
- He's goin'.
- Well, it's about time.

19:05.944 --> 19:08.412
Not that I don't appreciate
your hospitality.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.448
Have you talked to Barnswell?

19:10.516 --> 19:14.111
I don't talk to Barnswell unless
I have to. That is your department.

19:14.186 --> 19:17.678
Considering the fat percentage you
pull down, what is your department?

19:17.756 --> 19:20.122
Saving you from yourself...

19:20.192 --> 19:23.423
and keeping Alpine Crest the kind
of town nobody looks at twice.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.487
Now get your stuff.

19:34.206 --> 19:37.266
Michael, what's our
destination? I don't know, KITT.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.537
We're not giving up
on Ron Austin, are we?

19:39.611 --> 19:41.875
No, we're not giving up.

19:41.947 --> 19:44.472
We never give up.
You know that.

19:44.550 --> 19:48.418
'Alpine Crest.
Home of the Hallelujah Press."

19:48.487 --> 19:50.648
Hallelujah Press?

19:51.657 --> 19:53.648
I wonder what that is.

19:55.727 --> 19:57.627
It's the largest
Bible printers in the state.

19:59.598 --> 20:04.365
You know, we've been stumped as to why
Ron Austin came to this little town.

20:04.436 --> 20:08.998
What if it wasn't to... to distribute money,
but to pick it up?

20:09.074 --> 20:11.634
I don't follow your logic.

20:11.710 --> 20:14.406
I'm not sure that logic enters into it.

20:14.479 --> 20:16.970
Except to make counterfeit money,

20:17.049 --> 20:19.779
you need more than plates and paper.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.116
You need a printing press, KITT.

20:39.204 --> 20:42.537
- Are we hiding?
- No, KITT.

20:42.608 --> 20:45.668
We're just keeping
a low profile for a while.

21:06.565 --> 21:08.499
Oh, hello.
Hi.

21:08.567 --> 21:10.558
Oh, can I help you?

21:10.636 --> 21:13.696
Yes, you can. I just dropped by
to see Jobina for a couple minutes.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.969
Oh, you're the young man
she told me about.

21:17.042 --> 21:21.638
Michael Knight? That's right.
You're Martha Haberstraw, aren't you?

21:21.713 --> 21:23.647
Do you have any idea...

21:23.715 --> 21:28.015
how long it's been since a handsome
young man remembered my name?

21:28.086 --> 21:30.077
Don't answer that.

21:31.089 --> 21:33.614
Be patient with her.
She likes you.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.626
I can always tell.

21:35.694 --> 21:38.288
Oh, what are you saying about me?
Aunt Martha!

21:38.363 --> 21:42.493
Oh, it... it is time to be moving on.

21:42.567 --> 21:44.728
Remember what I said.
Bye-bye.

21:46.171 --> 21:48.503
Take whatever she said
with a grain of salt.

21:48.573 --> 21:51.133
I thought you left town.
Yeah, I did. But you know what?

21:51.209 --> 21:55.942
I'm beginning to like this little town. As a matter of
fact, I'm thinking about staying and buying a small business.

21:56.014 --> 21:58.676
I heard the Hallelujah Press
was for sale.

21:59.685 --> 22:02.916
Well, Charles Barnswell bought it
from my aunt last year.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.252
I can't imagine
where you heard it was for sale.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.849
No kidding.
Who's Charles Barnswell?

22:07.926 --> 22:11.225
A businessman. He, uh...
He's a retired government official.

22:11.296 --> 22:14.197
What branch of government?
I don't know.

22:14.266 --> 22:17.599
Why are you asking me all these
questions? What's going on? I wish I knew.

22:17.669 --> 22:20.297
Besides this newspaper here
and the Hallelujah Press,

22:20.372 --> 22:23.170
are there any other companies
in town that use printing presses?

22:23.241 --> 22:25.971
No. No, not that I can think of.
Okay. Thanks.

22:26.044 --> 22:27.909
Michael.

22:27.979 --> 22:31.608
Michael, I'm a reporter. Listen, I have a
constitutional right to know what's going on.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.617
You're absolutely right.

22:33.685 --> 22:37.815
And when I find out, I promise you...
You'll be the second to know.

22:42.928 --> 22:45.226
Tribune. Jobina Bruce speaking.

22:46.665 --> 22:48.599
What?

22:48.667 --> 22:50.601
I thought you told me to
discourage him.

22:50.669 --> 22:53.399
Yeah, well, I just got the report back
from Washington.

22:53.472 --> 22:55.406
There's no record of his prints,

22:55.474 --> 22:59.103
no driver's license,
no social security number... nothing.

22:59.177 --> 23:02.305
Well, then who is he?
That's a very good question.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.815
I want you to try
and get close to him, okay?

23:04.883 --> 23:08.410
Use your feminine wiles on him. Work
him over a little, love him up some.

23:08.487 --> 23:10.421
He'll break.
They all do.

23:10.489 --> 23:14.118
Mr. Larkin, there are limits
to what I consider my patriotic duty.

23:14.192 --> 23:17.593
And another thing, why am I the
only one doing any work around here?

23:17.662 --> 23:21.928
Well, look at it this way. Those Watergate
reporters had to spend months in a damp garage.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.968
All things considered,
you got it pretty easy.

23:24.035 --> 23:26.026
Thanks.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.003
You got that, Devon?

23:34.079 --> 23:37.640
Charles Barnswell,
retired federal employee.

23:37.716 --> 23:39.707
Let me see what I can do.

23:39.785 --> 23:42.879
By the way, are you still in Alpine
Crest? Are you enjoying yourself?

23:42.954 --> 23:45.718
Well, let me put it this way.

23:45.791 --> 23:48.385
It's a real nice place
if you're thinking of retirement.

23:48.460 --> 23:51.224
Oh, don't mention that, my dear
fellow. Don't even think it.

23:52.964 --> 23:57.230
- I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
- Okay. Give Bonnie a kiss for me, will you?

23:57.302 --> 23:59.736
I will. Of course.

24:02.707 --> 24:05.335
Michael, believe it or not,
there's Austin.

24:09.314 --> 24:13.011
Hi. Listen, I'm sorry I was so rude
in there. I just had a lot on my mind.

24:13.084 --> 24:15.075
Excuse me.

24:32.404 --> 24:34.338
Michael, look out.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.767
KITT, watch out for pedestrians.

24:37.843 --> 24:40.573
Of course, Michael.

24:56.795 --> 24:58.786
Don't worry, Michael.
We'll catch him.

25:27.826 --> 25:30.056
Here we go.

25:31.897 --> 25:33.990
Whoo! Yeah!

25:36.067 --> 25:39.901
Attention all units, two vehicles are racing
out of control through town.

25:40.906 --> 25:45.002
This is Car Three.
I got the lead vehicle in sight.

26:09.501 --> 26:12.629
Hey, what's going on?
I'm pursuing a suspect.

26:12.704 --> 26:14.899
You have the right
to remain silent.

26:14.973 --> 26:18.465
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

26:32.657 --> 26:34.591
Hey, Sheriff.
Hmm?

26:34.659 --> 26:37.219
What about that phone call, huh?
Local call?

26:37.295 --> 26:40.628
No, it's not a local call. What is
this? I'm entitled to a phone call.

26:40.699 --> 26:42.633
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

26:42.701 --> 26:46.364
Look, you may not like what I did, but I
did it because I was pursuing a suspect.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.803
Knight,

26:49.874 --> 26:52.672
I don't know who or what you are,

26:52.744 --> 26:54.735
but you are not a cop.

26:54.813 --> 26:59.147
And in this town,
the cops will pursue the suspects.

26:59.217 --> 27:01.151
Okay?

27:02.687 --> 27:05.417
Sheriff, i-if you don't mind,
I'd like my watch back, please.

27:05.490 --> 27:07.481
Sorry. Against regulations.

27:07.559 --> 27:09.493
Look, you're in big trouble, man.

27:09.561 --> 27:11.756
If I were you, I'd be less concerned
with regulations...

27:11.830 --> 27:14.628
and more concerned with what's
going on in front of your face!

27:14.699 --> 27:18.692
Mr. Knight, there are a lot of people
in this world I'll take advice from,

27:18.770 --> 27:21.432
but they don't talk to me
from behind bars.

27:21.506 --> 27:23.098
See?

27:23.174 --> 27:25.608
Enjoy your meal.

27:25.677 --> 27:28.111
That corn bread's homemade.

27:38.757 --> 27:41.521
Well, I've never seen anything
like this car before.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.761
I got an idea.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.797
Nice car.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.401
Good car.

27:50.468 --> 27:52.368
It's a car, Hanks, not a dog.

27:56.207 --> 27:58.801
Wait a minute.

27:58.877 --> 28:02.369
I got a better idea.
Do it again.

28:02.447 --> 28:04.506
It'll just move again.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.118
Do it.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.860
All right!

28:39.350 --> 28:41.511
Where have you been?
Don't ask.

28:41.586 --> 28:45.283
What do you mean, "Don't ask"? You were
supposed to be here at 1:00 this afternoon.

28:45.356 --> 28:48.325
I'm having a little problem
with a joker in a hot Trans-Am.

28:48.393 --> 28:53.353
He's been on my tail for two days. Every
time I think I've lost him, he shows up again.

28:53.431 --> 28:55.592
It's okay now.
Moore's got him in jail.

28:55.667 --> 28:58.659
It's about time he did something
to justify his percentage.

28:58.737 --> 29:02.639
I gave him a hard enough time. Don't
you get on his case. He does his job.

29:02.707 --> 29:06.939
Who'd ever think of Alpine Crest
as the counterfeit capital of the world?

29:07.011 --> 29:09.411
Anyway, I've got some people to see.
Where's the money?

29:09.481 --> 29:12.848
It's not ready yet. It was supposed
to be ready by 1:00 this afternoon.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.010
You got problems,
I got problems.

29:15.086 --> 29:17.020
There's a company man in town.

29:18.022 --> 29:20.320
Company. You mean C.I.A.

29:21.459 --> 29:24.622
I saw him this afternoon
when I went out for a sandwich.

29:24.696 --> 29:27.631
His name's Larkin. I remembered
him from a couple of years ago.

29:27.699 --> 29:31.465
He was a junior field operative at the
time. He's apparently been promoted.

29:31.536 --> 29:34.733
- Good for him. Where's a glass?
- Don't you hear what I'm saying?

29:34.806 --> 29:36.740
You think Larkin's here
for the clean air?

29:36.808 --> 29:39.709
He knows something.
He's here on assignment.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.338
You're not letting your imagination
run away with you again?

29:42.413 --> 29:44.404
Don't be condescending
with me, Austin.

29:44.482 --> 29:47.110
I'm the one
who's vulnerable here.

29:47.185 --> 29:49.949
I'm the one who headed up the pilot
program to counterfeit money.

29:50.021 --> 29:51.955
And when the company shut it down,

29:52.023 --> 29:55.720
I'm the one who got the plates
before they were destroyed.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.228
I created this operation.

29:58.296 --> 30:01.527
Imagination? You wouldn't
know the meaning of the word.

30:01.599 --> 30:03.567
I'll make it real clear for you.

30:04.569 --> 30:07.436
I spent 25 years with the company,

30:07.505 --> 30:10.531
and there's no way I'm gonna spend
the next 25 in prison.

30:10.608 --> 30:13.702
Now, if Larkin stays, I go.

30:13.778 --> 30:16.008
Either you find a way to detour him,

30:16.080 --> 30:20.278
or I'll shut down the presses
and take the plates with me.

30:26.758 --> 30:28.749
KITT?

30:28.827 --> 30:31.421
KITT, are you there?

30:32.764 --> 30:34.994
- Yes, Devon.
- Ah.

30:35.066 --> 30:38.365
KITT, what's happening? I've been
trying to reach Michael for over an hour.

30:38.436 --> 30:41.064
Michael is... indisposed.

30:41.139 --> 30:43.972
Oh. That means he's either
with a young lady or he's in jail.

30:44.042 --> 30:47.842
- No comment.
- I admire your loyalty, KITT.

30:47.912 --> 30:51.313
Frankly, I'd just as soon not know...
Unless, of course, he's in real trouble.

30:53.051 --> 30:57.078
I've got the information
on Charles Barnswell that he requested.

30:57.155 --> 30:59.885
When you see him, tell him
that Barnswell worked for the C.I.A...

30:59.958 --> 31:02.324
on several top-secret pilot projects...

31:02.393 --> 31:04.384
before retiring last year.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.725
- That's curious.
- Retiring?

31:07.799 --> 31:10.097
No.

31:10.168 --> 31:14.867
The last project he worked on involved a plan to
destabilize the economies of unfriendly countries.

31:14.939 --> 31:17.840
Believe it or not,
it involved infiltrating...

31:17.909 --> 31:20.571
counterfeit U.S. Dollars
into the monetary system.

31:20.645 --> 31:25.082
Hmm. The counterfeit plates used
were of the highest possible quality.

31:25.149 --> 31:28.676
Only recently it was discovered
that they were not destroyed after all.

31:28.753 --> 31:31.916
At present,
their whereabouts is unknown.

31:33.591 --> 31:36.082
Well, there you have it.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.151
Keep an eye on Michael.

31:38.229 --> 31:41.164
- I'll do my best, Devon.
- Right. That's the spirit.

31:49.507 --> 31:52.499
As an American citizen, not to mention
a member of the press, I insist...

31:52.577 --> 31:56.411
Wait a minute. That little fish wrapper you're
printing up, you're calling that the press?

31:56.481 --> 32:01.248
Just as surely as you call those six high
school dropouts in uniform the police force.

32:01.319 --> 32:03.810
Jobina, I've known
your Aunt Martha four years now...

32:03.888 --> 32:05.822
ever since I took over as sheriff.

32:05.890 --> 32:09.291
I like her, she likes me,
and that'll buy you a little flexibility.

32:09.360 --> 32:13.319
But it won't buy you sensationalizing
Knight's arrest in the Tribune.

32:13.398 --> 32:16.890
This town has a reputation to maintain,
and I'm the head maintenance man.

32:16.968 --> 32:19.528
Got that?
Now don't forget it.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.595
He's right in there.

32:26.644 --> 32:28.635
Hi.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.673
Hi.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.617
Listen, I would have baked you a
cake with a hacksaw blade in it,

32:35.687 --> 32:37.621
but I flunked
home economics.

32:37.689 --> 32:41.022
That's okay. I flunked hacksaw.
Thanks for coming.

32:41.092 --> 32:43.754
It's the least I could do.
You okay?

32:43.828 --> 32:45.659
No.

32:45.730 --> 32:48.130
What'd they do?
Violate your civil rights?

32:48.199 --> 32:50.190
Did they beat you
with a rubber hose?

32:50.268 --> 32:55.171
Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just forget
about your good-bye story for a minute and listen to me.

32:55.239 --> 32:57.707
Jobina, I'm not a skip tracer.

32:57.775 --> 33:00.175
I'm not an investor
looking for a small business.

33:00.244 --> 33:02.906
I work with Devon Miles,

33:02.981 --> 33:06.678
the man your Aunt Martha invited
to speak at the award ceremony.

33:06.751 --> 33:09.879
If you're with that Foundation,
why are you keeping it such a big secret?

33:09.954 --> 33:14.687
Because something strange is going on around
here, and it's gettin' stranger by the minute.

33:14.759 --> 33:18.456
Jobina, I came here in pursuit of
a counterfeit-money broker.

33:18.529 --> 33:22.124
When I saw him at the award ceremony,
I thought he was passing through.

33:22.200 --> 33:26.694
But I changed my mind.
I think he came here for a reason.

33:26.771 --> 33:30.400
- You mean Ron Austin?
- You know Ron Austin?

33:30.475 --> 33:32.409
The... The guy you chased in the park.

33:32.477 --> 33:34.570
He's a Bible salesman.

33:34.645 --> 33:36.636
At least that's what
Mr. Barnswell told us.

33:36.714 --> 33:38.841
You've seen him before?

33:38.916 --> 33:41.407
Yeah. He comes through here
once or twice a month.

33:41.486 --> 33:44.148
He stops by the Hallelujah Press,
picks up some Bibles.

33:45.823 --> 33:49.224
You know, for a guy in that profession,
he's a terrible flirt.

33:49.293 --> 33:51.625
Barnswell!
Why didn't I think of that before?

33:51.696 --> 33:55.632
Barnswell. He bought the Hallelujah Press
as a front for the counterfeit-money presses.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.725
Michael, this is it.
This is my story.

33:57.802 --> 33:59.861
Jobina, I'll make a deal with ya.

33:59.937 --> 34:02.201
We need each other.
Now, we team up here,

34:02.273 --> 34:05.003
I get the counterfeiters
and you get your good-bye story.

34:06.911 --> 34:10.244
- Deal?
- What do I have to do?

34:22.293 --> 34:24.591
I've never talked to a car before.

34:24.661 --> 34:26.652
Actually, that's not true.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.665
Yeah, I did talk to my Volkswagen.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.963
The difference is
it never talked back.

34:31.034 --> 34:33.799
Please, talk to me.

34:33.871 --> 34:35.862
If you don't,
I'll never forgive myself.

34:37.942 --> 34:41.206
Michael sent me.
He's in jail.

34:45.315 --> 34:47.284
KITT, he needs your help.

34:47.351 --> 34:49.683
Please, he told me
you'd know what to do.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.681
Is there anything I can do for you?

34:54.759 --> 34:57.056
Now that you mention it, yes.

34:57.128 --> 35:00.564
- If you'd be so kind as to put me down.
- Down?

35:00.631 --> 35:03.395
My dear, I'm a car, not a plane.

35:03.468 --> 35:06.460
Oh. Yes, of course you are.

35:06.537 --> 35:08.835
The release button is to your left.

35:16.280 --> 35:20.080
So, tell me, what were you doing
up there in the first place?

35:20.151 --> 35:22.051
Spinning my wheels.

35:23.421 --> 35:26.185
- That was a joke.
- Oh.

35:26.257 --> 35:28.418
As Michael would say, thanks, pal.

35:28.493 --> 35:31.394
Oh. Sure.

35:31.462 --> 35:34.090
Oh, of course, of course.
Anytime.

35:34.165 --> 35:37.430
Uh, is there anything else
I can do for you?

35:37.502 --> 35:40.835
Yes. Stand back.

36:07.798 --> 36:10.892
- You rang, Michael?
- What the hell was that?

36:13.371 --> 36:15.737
Hop in.

36:31.088 --> 36:35.616
Michael, I must remind you... This sort of thing
is causing excessive wear and tear to my system.

36:38.362 --> 36:41.820
When he didn't answer a second time, I
thought I'd check and see if he was okay.

36:41.899 --> 36:44.424
This is it.

36:44.502 --> 36:46.493
Hey, hey. Stand back.

36:55.513 --> 36:58.107
Uh, his name's Larkin.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.542
Is he dead?

37:19.103 --> 37:21.128
Jobina.

37:21.205 --> 37:23.799
Jobina!

37:23.874 --> 37:25.808
My, aren't we in a foul mood.

37:25.876 --> 37:27.810
Busy morning?

37:27.878 --> 37:29.937
I want to see both those stories.

37:30.014 --> 37:32.608
Knight's escape and the murder
before you go to press.

37:32.683 --> 37:37.017
- I can't believe you said that.
- Well, you believe it. And you believe I can back it up too.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.283
Sheriff, I don't know
where you think you are,

37:39.357 --> 37:41.291
but you've got
your geography confused.

37:41.359 --> 37:43.850
This is not Russia! It's not
some South American dictatorship.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.954
We have freedom of the press here
and very tough laws to guarantee it.

37:47.031 --> 37:49.261
A lot tougher than you are.

37:49.333 --> 37:52.461
Give a girl a little college, she
thinks she knows how the world works.

37:52.536 --> 37:54.697
You stay away from me.
No. That isn't my style.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.740
Here's my style.

37:56.807 --> 38:00.504
I've got a witness who can place you in the
immediate vicinity of the police garage...

38:00.578 --> 38:04.480
just minutes before somebody took
that car and busted Knight out of jail.

38:04.548 --> 38:09.349
Now, if you weren't with your Aunt
Martha playing bridge during that time,

38:09.420 --> 38:13.015
I can arrest you right now...
As an accessory.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.392
Now you think about that...

38:16.460 --> 38:18.553
before you print your little stories.

39:00.604 --> 39:03.368
Michael, we can't stay
hidden here forever.

39:03.441 --> 39:06.239
- Punch me up a visual, will you, KITT?
- Right away, Michael.

39:07.378 --> 39:11.280
As you can see, the patrol cars are
still in the immediate area.

39:12.483 --> 39:15.008
Ah. Yoo-hoo.

39:15.086 --> 39:17.213
Good morning.
Good morning.

39:19.623 --> 39:21.784
Let me give you a hand
with this, huh? Oh.

39:21.859 --> 39:25.386
Well, just put it on the chair there.
We'll take it inside in a while.

39:25.463 --> 39:28.057
No luck?
No luck.

39:28.132 --> 39:32.159
Aunt Martha, they're everywhere. I couldn't
get within a hundred yards of Hallelujah Press.

39:33.170 --> 39:37.038
Good. Then maybe you'll have enough time
to come for a country breakfast with me.

39:37.108 --> 39:39.042
I couldn't think of anything better...
Oh.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.408
But I'm sorry, I don't have the time.

39:41.479 --> 39:43.413
Aunt Martha,
I need your help.

40:19.583 --> 40:24.111
Now, Aunt Martha, just sit back, relax,
and leave the driving to me.

40:43.974 --> 40:47.341
Oh, KITT, this is fun.
I love it.

40:47.411 --> 40:49.504
- I'm glad, Aunt Martha.
- Oh, my!

40:54.752 --> 40:58.813
Patrol, we've spotted Knight
heading north on 3-7.

40:58.889 --> 41:01.881
Repeat. Highway 37, heading north.
Move in to intercept.

41:05.830 --> 41:07.923
That's a roger.

41:07.998 --> 41:09.863
Oh, my Lord!

41:33.524 --> 41:35.424
Here we go, Aunt Martha.

41:37.595 --> 41:41.725
- Wow!
- Sheriff, I got him heading my way. I'll run him back to you.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.591
Hang on, Aunt Martha.

41:57.681 --> 41:59.615
Here we go.

42:04.889 --> 42:05.947
Oh!

42:19.303 --> 42:21.703
What you did
is the act of an insane man.

42:21.772 --> 42:25.503
You said to detour Junior
Agent Larkin. Well, dig this.

42:25.576 --> 42:27.908
One man's detour
is another's derailment.

42:27.978 --> 42:29.912
So I derailed the sucker.

42:29.980 --> 42:32.972
What are you, a child?

42:33.050 --> 42:35.211
You don't walk around,

42:35.286 --> 42:37.516
kill a C.I.A. Field agent...

42:37.588 --> 42:39.818
and continue to walk around.

42:39.890 --> 42:42.654
Whether you know it or not,
you're a dead man.

42:42.726 --> 42:46.526
I don't do business with dead men.

42:46.597 --> 42:50.294
You take one more step,
and you'll never do business again.

42:50.367 --> 42:54.599
Okay, Austin. You want the
plates? You got the plates.

43:01.946 --> 43:03.937
You're driving.

43:39.483 --> 43:41.974
Hey. What are you doing
in her car?

43:42.052 --> 43:44.077
I thought I told you
to let me handle this.

43:44.154 --> 43:47.419
Well, they're not in
there. They left. Which way?

43:52.463 --> 43:55.091
Here we are, Aunt Martha.
Safe and sound.

43:55.165 --> 43:58.259
Oh, hot dog! What a car!

43:58.335 --> 44:01.532
I gotta borrow it. Well,
whatever you say, good-lookin'.

44:01.605 --> 44:04.904
What do you think you're doin'? You
want to argue or catch those guys?

44:04.975 --> 44:06.909
Okay.

44:06.977 --> 44:09.275
Bye-bye. Whoo!

44:23.661 --> 44:25.754
I'm getting a reading
on the suspect vehicle.

44:25.829 --> 44:29.595
He will enter the monitor
at south-southeast, color yellow.

44:31.101 --> 44:35.902
All right. If we play this one right, we should
be able to run the whole table with one ball.

44:35.973 --> 44:37.998
Let's go for it!

44:41.845 --> 44:43.779
Hang on.

44:52.456 --> 44:54.424
Sheriff, this is Deputy Cole.

44:54.491 --> 44:57.654
The suspect's headed your way,
north on Highway 12.

45:11.575 --> 45:13.133
I got him now.

45:29.760 --> 45:31.022
There he is.

45:31.095 --> 45:35.964
You said some guy in a black Trans-Am had been
following you. Look behind and tell me if that's him.

45:36.033 --> 45:38.024
I don't believe it.

45:42.039 --> 45:44.667
Give him a blast, KITT.
You there. Austin.

45:44.742 --> 45:46.801
Pull over.

45:58.956 --> 46:00.890
Are they okay?

46:00.958 --> 46:03.051
Yeah. Just shaken up.

46:03.127 --> 46:05.459
Hey, KITT.

46:05.529 --> 46:07.827
I think we crossed the county line.

46:07.898 --> 46:10.196
Patch me through
to a friendly sheriff, will ya?

46:10.267 --> 46:14.169
- I'll see what I can do, Michael.
- Is there anything this car can't do?

46:15.739 --> 46:18.731
I think a woman
would be a better judge of that.

46:18.809 --> 46:21.039
I beg your pardon?

46:28.152 --> 46:31.417
Tell you the truth, Devon,
don't you feel a little foolish,

46:31.488 --> 46:33.456
giving them the Foundation's award,

46:33.524 --> 46:36.391
finding out their town
didn't have a low crime rate after all?

46:36.460 --> 46:39.952
I imagine the new sheriff will, uh,
restore tranquillity in short order.

46:40.030 --> 46:41.998
I'm glad they kept the award.

46:42.065 --> 46:44.260
I never realized
there were still towns like that.

46:45.369 --> 46:47.860
I think I'd have liked growing up there.

46:47.938 --> 46:51.772
By the way, is Jobina really going to leave,
now that she's got her good-bye story?

46:51.842 --> 46:53.776
Well, if I were a betting man,
I would, uh,

46:53.844 --> 46:57.336
wager that she would think it over
and then decide to stay.

46:57.414 --> 47:00.247
- I hope she does.
- So you know where to find her?

47:00.317 --> 47:02.376
Yeah, that's a thought.

47:02.452 --> 47:07.219
Well, now that Aunt Martha's back at
the helm of the Hallelujah Press again,

47:07.291 --> 47:09.282
she wanted each of you
to have a keepsake.

47:09.359 --> 47:11.554
Ah, a Bible.
Hey, it's nice.

47:11.628 --> 47:14.324
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes. Quite.

47:14.398 --> 47:17.561
- And informative.
- May I ask who programmed it?

47:22.105 --> 47:24.699
Well, that's, uh,
kind of a long story, KITT.

47:24.775 --> 47:26.902
That's all right, Michael.
I have plenty of time.

47:28.345 --> 47:32.304
It seems to me that you've got your
work cut out, old boy. Come, Bonnie.

47:32.382 --> 47:34.976
- Oh, wait a minute.
- Bye-bye.

47:35.052 --> 47:37.612
Uh... Uh...
Michael, I'm sure it's no problem.

47:37.688 --> 47:39.986
Just begin at the beginning.

47:49.967 --> 47:51.958
Okay.
