00:01.500 --> 00:03.542
Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.542 --> 00:04.959
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE ANGRY WITH ME

00:04.959 --> 00:06.000
FOR KISSING YOU.

00:06.000 --> 00:06.667
I THINK YOU'RE
ANGRY WITH YOURSELF

00:06.667 --> 00:08.708
FOR KISSING ME BACK.

00:08.708 --> 00:09.834
YOU KISSED MY GIRLFRIEND.

00:09.834 --> 00:10.917
THE TRUTH IS
I'D DO IT AGAIN.

00:10.917 --> 00:11.834
KISS ME.

00:11.834 --> 00:13.000
I THOUGHT
YOU'D NEVER ASK.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.875
Joey:
YOU MAKE ME SO HAPPY,

00:14.875 --> 00:17.208
BUT I HAVE TO MAKE
MYSELF HAPPY FIRST.

00:17.208 --> 00:20.000
WE CAN'T JUST SAY
I LOVE YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
AND HAVE IT BE OVER!

00:21.000 --> 00:21.291
GOOD NIGHT.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.291
Woman [ON TV]:
I TRUST I MAY HAVE LEAVE
TO SPEAK, AND SPEAK I WILL.

00:35.291 --> 00:38.500
Dawson: THERE'S NOT
A SINGLE DRAMATIC
STORY LINE IN EXISTENCE

00:38.500 --> 00:40.375
THAT SHAKESPEARE
DIDN'T CONQUER FIRST.

00:40.375 --> 00:43.000
FAMILY REVENGE,
POLITICAL INTRIGUE,
THE GREAT GENDER BATTLE.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.375
THE GUY MAPPED IT
ALL OUT FOR US.

00:45.375 --> 00:46.834
AND WHAT WAS
HIS PARTING LESSON?

00:46.834 --> 00:49.000
WHAT GENRE OF ALL GENRES
DID HE FINALLY ARRIVE AT

00:49.000 --> 00:53.375
AFTER YEARS OF TOIL
AND SACRIFICE? TRAGEDY.

00:53.375 --> 00:54.208
SHH!

00:54.208 --> 00:55.875
LIKE ALL GREAT ROMANTICS,

00:55.875 --> 00:59.708
HE FINALLY REALIZED
THAT LIFE WAS A LOT
MORE LIKELY TO END UP

00:59.708 --> 01:02.166
WITH A BUNCH OF DEAD
DANISH PEOPLE ON STAGE
THAN WITH A KISS.

01:04.375 --> 01:05.208
WHAT A SAD MOVIE.

01:05.208 --> 01:07.667
MOM, YOU CRIED
AT COMMERCIALS.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.625
ONLY THAT
COTTON COMMERCIAL.

01:09.625 --> 01:12.792
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR PERPETUAL
STATE OF MELANCHOLY.

01:12.792 --> 01:15.542
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT YOU.

01:15.542 --> 01:19.959
WELL, HONEY,
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT YOU.

01:19.959 --> 01:21.792
EVER SINCE
YOUR BREAKUP WITH JOEY,

01:21.792 --> 01:23.166
YOU HAVEN'T SAID
ONE WORD ABOUT IT.

01:23.166 --> 01:26.917
DAWSON, YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN WALLOWED.

01:26.917 --> 01:28.583
WHAT GOOD
IS WALLOWING?

01:28.583 --> 01:31.125
ALL THE WALLOWING
IN THE WORLD DOESN'T
BRING SOMEONE BACK.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.250
WALLOWING ISN'T
ABOUT GETTING THEM BACK.

01:32.250 --> 01:35.583
IT ISN'T ABOUT THEM AT ALL.
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

01:35.583 --> 01:37.542
AND LEARNING
TO ALLOW YOURSELF

01:37.542 --> 01:40.917
THE FEW MEAGER ADVANTAGES
OF BEING THE DUMPEE.

01:40.917 --> 01:42.583
ADVANTAGES?

01:42.583 --> 01:47.166
SURE, LIKE ALLOWING YOURSELF
TO STUFF YOUR FACE

01:47.166 --> 01:50.417
WITH A LIFETIME SUPPLY OF
RED LICORICE AND DOUGHNUTS.

01:50.417 --> 01:54.834
OR, UM, A NEWFOUND
APPRECIATION
FOR COUNTRY MUSIC.

01:54.834 --> 01:58.208
LIKE AN EXCUSE TO WATCH
THAT LAST SCENE
FROM FIELD OF DREAMS.

01:58.208 --> 02:01.708
ACQUIRING THE NECESSARY
PAIN TO WRITE
BAD, BITTER POETRY.

02:01.708 --> 02:02.959
A REASON TO SCOWL.

02:02.959 --> 02:03.917
A REASON TO BITCH!

02:03.917 --> 02:04.959
WORK OUT AGGRESSION.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.041
YEAH! YOU SEE,

02:06.041 --> 02:08.125
WHEN YOU THINK
ABOUT IT, HONEY,

02:08.125 --> 02:12.083
EVERY INCH OF PAIN
THAT TOUCHES YOU

02:12.083 --> 02:14.250
MAKES YOU A DEEPER,
MORE REAL INDIVIDUAL.

02:14.250 --> 02:19.959
WHETHER YOU'RE 15 OR...
SLIGHTLY OLDER.

02:19.959 --> 02:22.417
SO IT DOESN'T
GET ANY EASIER?

02:22.417 --> 02:26.291
NOPE. YOU JUST
GO TO BED EARLIER.

02:26.291 --> 02:28.208
NIGHT, HONEY.

02:28.208 --> 02:29.667
GOOD NIGHT, MOM.

02:29.667 --> 02:34.125
UM, HOPE I WAS AN
ACCEPTABLE SUBSTITUTE
FOR MOVIE NIGHT.

02:34.125 --> 02:36.166
YOU DID GREAT.

04:04.834 --> 04:08.542
"WHAT LIGHT THROUGH
YONDER WINDOW BREAKS?"

04:08.542 --> 04:12.458
IT IS THE MIDTERM.

04:12.458 --> 04:17.791
AND YOUR IMPENDING FAILURE
IS BUT HOURS AWAY.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.333
BLUE BOOKS.

04:20.333 --> 04:22.083
YOU'LL NOTICE
THEY ARE BLANK.

04:22.083 --> 04:24.917
AND FOR MANY OF YOU,

04:24.917 --> 04:30.792
THEY'LL SCORE HIGHER AS SUCH
THAN WHEN ACTUALLY WRITTEN IN.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.667
PLEASE SIGN YOUR REAL NAME,
AHEM.

04:32.667 --> 04:36.417
AS FOR THE TEST, AHEM,
IT WILL COVER EVERYTHING

04:36.417 --> 04:39.333
WE HAVE STUDIED IN
ENGLISH LITERATURE THUS FAR

04:39.333 --> 04:45.834
AND WILL BE WORTH 50%
OF THIS TERM'S GRADE.

04:47.583 --> 04:50.750
MAIN POINTS OF INTEREST:
SHAKESPEARE, DICKENS,
THE ROMANTICS,

04:50.750 --> 04:55.750
AND YOUR FAVORITE--THE READ
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT--

04:55.750 --> 04:56.750
BEOWULF.

05:01.250 --> 05:04.959
I WILL BE HOSTING
A STUDY SESSION

05:04.959 --> 05:06.917
IN THIS CLASSROOM
AT 3:00.

05:06.917 --> 05:09.000
IT IS MY RECOMMENDATION
YOU ATTEND,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.375
UNLESS,
OF COURSE, YOUR PARENTS

05:11.375 --> 05:16.542
HAVE DEDICATED
A EAST WING OR TWO TO
AN IVY LEAGUE INSTITUTION,

05:16.542 --> 05:21.125
IN WHICH CASE YOUR TRAGIC,
EAST COAST ARISTOCRATIC,
SOCIAL ALCOHOLIC FATE

05:21.125 --> 05:24.792
HAS ALREADY BEEN SEALED.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.500
THIS IS MORE THAN
JUST AN EXAM, PEOPLE.

05:29.959 --> 05:31.125
IT'S YOUR LIFE.

05:31.125 --> 05:33.667
[BELL RINGING]

05:35.708 --> 05:36.542
HEY.

05:38.792 --> 05:41.834
DAWSON, AT SOME POINT
WE HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING
TO EACH OTHER.

05:41.834 --> 05:43.250
WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO SAY, JOEY?

05:43.250 --> 05:45.208
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO SAY?

05:45.208 --> 05:46.792
GO AWAY.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.333
BESIDES THAT.

05:50.333 --> 05:53.250
JOEY, YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR
YOU NEEDED SPACE, OK?

05:53.250 --> 05:54.834
I AM GIVING YOU THAT SPACE.

05:54.834 --> 05:56.000
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD MEAN

05:56.000 --> 05:58.500
WE'D BE CUTTING OFF
ALL COMMUNICATION,
DAWSON.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.250
WHAT DID YOU THINK,
IT WOULD MEAN, JOEY?

06:00.250 --> 06:01.333
THIS ISN'T FAIR.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.291
TO WHICH ONE OF US?

06:02.291 --> 06:03.834
YOU CAN'T MAKE UP
ALL THE RULES!

06:03.834 --> 06:04.792
I DON'T WANT TO.

06:04.792 --> 06:06.417
THEN WHAT
DO YOU WANT?!

06:14.125 --> 06:16.250
ONE DAY THIS CAFETERIA
IS DESTINED

06:16.250 --> 06:17.583
TO COOK A FRY THAT
ACTUALLY TASTES LIKE A FRY.

06:17.583 --> 06:21.542
MéNAGE Ä TROIS.
EVER BEEN IN ONE?

06:21.542 --> 06:25.250
ALL HAIL, THE QUEEN
OF NON SEQUITURS HAS SPOKEN.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.792
IT'S NOT A NON SEQUITUR.
IT'S THIS MONTH'S JANE.

06:27.792 --> 06:29.667
CHICK MAGAZINES
ARE RACIER THAN PLAYBOY.

06:29.667 --> 06:31.333
THERE'S ALWAYS
SOME ARTICLE IN THERE

06:31.333 --> 06:33.458
ABOUT HOW
TO PROLONG YOUR THIS
OR AROUSE YOUR THAT.

06:33.458 --> 06:34.792
THIS ONE'S
A PURITY TEST.

06:34.792 --> 06:36.708
WHAT?

06:36.708 --> 06:38.875
PURITY TEST.
YOU'VE HEARD OF 'EM.

06:38.875 --> 06:40.375
AN ASSORTMENT
OF SEXUAL QUESTIONS

06:40.375 --> 06:43.375
WHICH WHEN TOTALED IS
MEANT TO GAUGE THE LEVEL
OF SEXUAL EXPERIENCE.

06:43.375 --> 06:46.083
OKEY-DOKEY. TIME
TO PUT THAT AWAY NOW.

06:46.083 --> 06:48.375
WHY? IT'S FUN.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.625
GAUGING OUR LEVEL
OF SEXUAL EXPERTISE

06:50.625 --> 06:54.166
IS NOT REALLY MY IDEA
OF JOY ABOUNDING.

06:54.166 --> 06:58.083
DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT,
PACEY WITTER.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.125
I KNOW YOUR HISTORY.

07:00.125 --> 07:01.667
YOU DO?

07:01.667 --> 07:04.250
SURE. YOU'RE
A TYPICAL GUY.

07:04.250 --> 07:05.750
YOU WANT EVERYONE
TO THINK

07:05.750 --> 07:10.917
YOU HAVE THIS UNSEEMLY,
ADVENTUROUS
SEXUAL EXISTENCE

07:10.917 --> 07:12.834
WHEN IN FACT
YOUR PURITY LEVEL

07:12.834 --> 07:16.000
IS PROBABLY CLOSER
TO BIG BIRD'S
THAN BILL CLINTON'S.

07:17.291 --> 07:19.375
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU GOT ME.

07:19.375 --> 07:21.917
THAT'S ME, MR.
EMBARRASSINGLY PURE.

07:21.917 --> 07:24.750
WHATEVER. SO, AM I
GONNA SEE YOU AT
PETERSON'S CRAM-O-RAMA?

07:24.750 --> 07:26.333
THAT WOULD IMPLY
THAT I AM GOING.

07:26.333 --> 07:29.208
NO, NO, PACEY,
YOU CANNOT BAIL
ON THIS STUDY SESSION.

07:29.208 --> 07:30.250
WAY TOO IMPORTANT.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.250
TO YOU.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.708
TO ANYONE WHO CARES
ABOUT THEIR GRADE.

07:33.708 --> 07:34.417
WELL, SEE,
THERE'S THE RUB.

07:34.417 --> 07:36.625
YO SOY
NOT CONCERNED.

07:36.625 --> 07:37.708
DON'T JOKE ABOUT THIS.
I'M SERIOUS.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.625
AS COMMITTED AS YOU ARE
TO DOING EVERYTHING

07:39.625 --> 07:42.000
WITHIN YOUR POWER
TO GETTING AN "A,"

07:42.000 --> 07:43.959
I AM EQUALLY COMMITTED
TO GETTING MY "C."

07:43.959 --> 07:45.875
POSSIBLY "D" IF I
CAN'T GET A GOOD LOOK
AT YOUR ANSWER SHEET.

07:45.875 --> 07:47.750
PACEY.

07:47.750 --> 07:50.458
GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON
WHY I SHOULD.

07:50.458 --> 07:51.792
ME.

07:55.750 --> 07:57.500
OK. FINE. I'LL GO.

07:57.500 --> 08:00.750
JUST DON'T EXPECT ME
TO STAY AWAKE.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.041
JEN-A-LISH, DELISH.

08:03.041 --> 08:05.458
HEY, CHRIS.
WHAT'S UP?

08:05.458 --> 08:06.542
LONG RUN TODAY.

08:06.542 --> 08:07.458
YEAH.

08:07.458 --> 08:08.500
THOUGHT YOU'D BE LOOKING

08:08.500 --> 08:10.166
FOR SOMEONE
TO KEEP STRIDE WITH.

08:10.166 --> 08:12.417
AND YOU'D LIKE
TO BE THAT SOMEONE?

08:12.417 --> 08:14.458
I'M A GOOD PACER.

08:14.458 --> 08:16.500
I KNOW WHEN TO SPEED UP
AND WHEN TO SLOW DOWN.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.000
AND WHEN
TO LEAVE SOMEONE ALONE?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.583
JEN, IS THERE
A PARTICULAR REASON

08:21.583 --> 08:23.834
WHY YOU'RE NOT RECEPTIVE
TO MY WILY CHARMS?

08:23.834 --> 08:26.667
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT
YOU EMIT THEM REGULARLY

08:26.667 --> 08:29.041
TO ANY SKIRT
WITHIN A 6-MILE RADIUS?

08:29.041 --> 08:30.000
ACTUALLY, I HAVE A CAR,

08:30.000 --> 08:31.917
SO IT'S MORE LIKE
THE TRI-STATE AREA.

08:31.917 --> 08:34.375
AHA. A SMILE.

08:34.375 --> 08:35.958
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

08:35.958 --> 08:37.958
[SIGHS]

08:37.958 --> 08:38.792
LATER, CHRIS.

08:48.333 --> 08:51.000
AND THE HAWK CIRCLES.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.500
HE'S JUST BEING CUTE,

08:53.500 --> 08:55.250
WHICH HE REALLY IS.

08:55.250 --> 08:57.917
YOU SEEN HIS LOVE 'EM
AND LEAVE 'EM RAP SHEET?
IT'S EPIC.

08:57.917 --> 08:59.375
RELAX, DAWSON.

08:59.375 --> 09:01.166
JUST LOOKING OUT.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.792
SO, YOU HITTING
THAT STUDY SESSION?

09:03.792 --> 09:05.083
OH. I DOUBT IT.

09:05.083 --> 09:09.625
I'M NOT MUCH IN
THE "APPLYING MYSELF"
ZONE THESE DAYS.

09:09.625 --> 09:11.000
HOW ABOUT YOU?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.375
WELL, IT'S EITHER THAT

09:12.375 --> 09:15.708
OR ANOTHER EVENING
WATCHING SOME AWFUL,
SEVENTIES TEARJERKER

09:15.708 --> 09:17.708
WITH MY MOTHER,
SO...YOU SHOULD GO.

09:20.208 --> 09:22.041
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
DAWSON.

09:22.041 --> 09:23.917
SINCE IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE I'LL BE HAVING

09:23.917 --> 09:27.083
A HOT NIGHT OF UNBRIDLED
PASSION WITH ROMEO
OVER THERE,

09:27.083 --> 09:28.708
I'LL CONSIDER IT.

09:28.708 --> 09:29.875
ALL RIGHT.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.083
"DEAR CLASS,
WENT HOME WITH A COLD

09:32.083 --> 09:35.542
"THAT WAS CONSIDERABLY
MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.583
"THE TEST IS STILL ON
FOR TOMORROW.

09:37.583 --> 09:38.917
"STUDY THE SAMPLE QUESTIONS.

09:38.917 --> 09:41.708
UNTIL THEN, HARDLY YOURS,
MR. PETERSON."

09:41.708 --> 09:45.417
SO HE BAILED ON HIS
OWN SESSION. GREAT.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.417
WE SHOULD HAVE
OUR OWN STUDY SESSION.

09:47.417 --> 09:49.125
MY FOLKS ARE
IN SAINT MARTIN.

09:49.125 --> 09:50.834
WE'LL HAVE THE WHOLE
HOUSE TO OURSELVES.

09:50.834 --> 09:52.583
LIKE WE'D GET A LOT
OF WORK DONE THAT WAY.

09:52.583 --> 09:55.083
THE LADY QUESTIONS
MY MOTIVES?

09:55.083 --> 09:57.166
INVITE YOUR FRIENDS.

09:57.166 --> 09:58.417
YOU TWO INTERESTED?

09:58.417 --> 10:01.000
LET'S STUDY AT MY PLACE.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.125
I WAS THINKING MORE
ALONG THE LINES OF
THE CITY LIBRARY.

10:04.125 --> 10:07.083
WHOA, WHOA. HIS OFFER
DOES HAVE A CERTAIN
ENTICING QUALITY.

10:07.083 --> 10:10.250
SINCE WHEN HAVE YOU
BEEN IN SUCH A RUSH
TO FORM A STUDY GROUP?

10:10.250 --> 10:12.083
HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN THIS MAN'S HOUSE?

10:12.083 --> 10:14.250
HIS FAMILY
IS TOTALLY LOADED.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.208
THEY GOT
A SATELLITE DISH.

10:16.208 --> 10:19.125
OH, COME ON.

10:19.125 --> 10:20.917
ALL RIGHT. WE'RE IN.

10:20.917 --> 10:22.667
COOL.
I'LL DRIVE.

10:24.750 --> 10:25.750
YOUNG LADY.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.417
WILL YOU
JOIN US?

10:28.417 --> 10:30.041
HOW CAN I RESIST?

10:35.959 --> 10:38.959
Andie: HEY, JOEY.
SO WHAT ARE YOUR STUDY PLANS?

10:38.959 --> 10:41.667
OH, JUST ME, MY ENGLISH LIT
BOOK, AND A LOUD, CRYING BABY.

10:41.667 --> 10:43.625
GOOD. THEN YOU CAN
COME WITH ME.

10:43.625 --> 10:44.917
WHERE?

10:44.917 --> 10:47.834
A STUDY SESSION AT CHRIS
WOLFE'S. I CAN'T DO THIS ALONE.

10:47.834 --> 10:51.041
CHRIS WOLFE'S? YOU'RE GOING TO
RELY ON CHRIS WOLFE TO PROVIDE A
SUITABLE STUDY ENVIRONMENT?

10:51.041 --> 10:54.166
I THINK I'M BETTER OFF
WITH THE LOUD, CRYING BABY.

10:54.166 --> 10:56.458
OK, DO YOU HONESTLY
BELIEVE I WOULD LET THIS NIGHT

10:56.458 --> 10:58.708
BE ANYTHING LESS THAN
RIDICULOUSLY BENEFICIAL?

10:58.708 --> 11:01.834
TRUST ME. I'M IN MEGA-CONTROL
OF THIS EVENT.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.250
HEY DAWSON! WHERE YOU
HEADED LITTLE BUDDY?

11:05.250 --> 11:08.375
WELL, SKIPPER, I SAW PETERSON'S
NOTE. I'M HEADED HOME.

11:08.375 --> 11:12.333
I'M ACTUALLY HEADED TO A
DIFFERENT STUDY SESSION, IF
YOU'RE UP FOR IT.

11:12.333 --> 11:13.500
"DIFFERENT STUDY SESSION"?

11:13.500 --> 11:15.000
IS THIS PACEY WITTER CODE
FOR PARTY?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.500
BROTHEL? ROAD TRIP
TO DISNEYLAND?

11:16.500 --> 11:19.000
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS IS A
TRUE MEETING OF INTELLECTUALS

11:19.000 --> 11:23.417
IN A HIGHLY MODERATED STUDIOUS
ENVIRONMENT AND THAT, MY FRIEND,
IS OUR RIDE.

11:23.417 --> 11:24.500
[HONKS HORN]

11:24.500 --> 11:25.166
Pacey: SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

11:25.166 --> 11:27.333
SURE.

12:03.917 --> 12:05.917
UH, THE TV IS THAT WAY.

12:05.917 --> 12:08.542
THE JACUZZI AND SAUNA
ARE OUT BACK.

12:08.542 --> 12:10.000
WE KEEP EXTRA SUITS IN THE
GUEST ROOM,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.708
AND, UH, KITCHEN'S THAT WAY
IF YOU GET HUNGRY.

12:12.708 --> 12:15.250
SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE GOING
TO GET A LOT OF STUDYING DONE.

12:15.250 --> 12:18.458
REMINDER, I'M IN
COMPLETE CONTROL HERE.

12:18.458 --> 12:20.375
[CLEARS THROAT]

12:20.375 --> 12:23.667
EVERYONE, MY LITTLE SISTER,
DINA.

12:24.917 --> 12:27.917
SHE PROMISES TO STAY
OUT OF THE WAY.

12:27.917 --> 12:30.333
NOPE. THIS ROOM ISN'T
GONNA DO.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.542
WE'RE GONNA NEED A LONG
TABLE, PROPER LIGHTING,

12:32.542 --> 12:34.375
AND HIGH-BACKED CHAIRS.

12:36.333 --> 12:37.750
WHERE'S PACEY?

12:38.750 --> 12:40.500
HEY, CHECK THIS OUT.

12:40.500 --> 12:41.583
TWO HUNDRED CHANNELS FROM
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

12:41.583 --> 12:42.917
IT'S A COUCH POTATO'S DREAM.

12:42.917 --> 12:46.083
LOOK AT THAT!
3 STOOGES  IN CANTONESE.

12:46.083 --> 12:50.917
WHY DO YOU INSIST ON UNDERMINING
ME AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY YOU GET?

12:50.917 --> 12:53.667
THINK OF HOW BORING
THE ALTERNATIVE IS.

12:53.667 --> 12:56.333
LOOK, I'M GOING TO NEED YOUR
HELP WITH OUR ATTENTION DEFICIT
HOST, OK?

12:56.333 --> 12:59.917
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN EXPEND
ENERGY ROUNDING UP THE BOTH OF
YOU.

12:59.917 --> 13:00.917
NOW, COME ON!

13:00.917 --> 13:03.750
[WHINING]
BUT I WANNA WATCH TV.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.458
SO, THE PLAN OF ATTACK
IS SIMPLE.

13:05.458 --> 13:08.166
USING THIS BOOK, WE'LL SPEND 30
MINUTES ON EACH OF THE VARIOUS
SECTIONS:

13:08.166 --> 13:11.834
VICTORIAN POETRY, SHAKESPEARE,
DICKENS, ETC.

13:11.834 --> 13:15.917
AND, BY MY WATCH, IF WE ALLOW
FOR A FEW 15 MINUTE BREAKS,

13:15.917 --> 13:18.917
WE'LL BE ABLE TO COVER THE
ENTIRE COURSE LOAD BY MIDNIGHT.

13:18.917 --> 13:23.125
THAT WILL STILL GIVE US ENOUGH
TIME TO DO AN HOUR SPEED ROUND
AND GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

13:23.125 --> 13:24.250
SOUND GOOD?

13:28.625 --> 13:29.959
UH, ANYBODY WANNA ORDER PIZZA?

13:29.959 --> 13:31.959
Joey: ME.
ABSOLUTELY, YEAH.

13:31.959 --> 13:34.959
HEY, I GOT IT!

13:34.959 --> 13:40.792
LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU JUST THINK
OF THIS AS SEVERAL OF OUR 15
MINUTES BREAKS STRUNG TOGETHER?

13:40.792 --> 13:44.875
GOT A BOTTLE IN HERE FROM '84.
IT'S FROM NAPA.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.083
FANCY.

13:47.083 --> 13:49.542
WELL, ACTUALLY THE WINE IS MADE
BY A MARRIED COUPLE

13:49.542 --> 13:53.041
WHO HAVE SORT OF A MOM-AND-POP
VINEYARD THING GOING.

13:53.041 --> 13:56.166
I WAS TAUGHT TO CHOOSE
QUALITY OVER LABELS.

13:59.542 --> 14:02.708
I THINK WE'RE GETTING TO KNOW
EACH OTHER MINUS SEXUAL
OVERTONES.

14:02.708 --> 14:05.291
WELL, IT IS POSSIBLE.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
YOU KNOW, JEN, IT BOTHERS ME
THAT YOU ASSUME THE WORST ABOUT
ME.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.500
I DON'T ABOUT YOU.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.834
WELL, GIVEN OUR PREVIOUS
ENCOUNTERS, PLUS YOUR
REPUTATION,

14:15.834 --> 14:18.792
WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT
ME TO ASSUME?

14:19.500 --> 14:21.583
THAT WE'RE A LOT ALIKE.

14:21.583 --> 14:25.291
THAT REPUTATIONS AREN'T WORTH
THE AIR THEY'RE WRITTEN ON,

14:25.291 --> 14:30.500
AND THAT THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY
GET TO KNOW SOMEONE IS BY
GETTING TO KNOW THEM.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.500
DEAL.

14:38.708 --> 14:41.917
I DON'T WANT TO LET GO
JUST YET..

ADDITIONAL 100 POINTS,

HIT THAT HOT TUB?

CHILL OUT A BIT?

15:37.333 --> 15:38.333
WE'VE BEEN CHILLIN' OUT
FOR 2 HOURS.

15:38.333 --> 15:41.750
WHAT WE NEED TO DO
NOW IS FOCUS.

15:42.625 --> 15:45.291
WELL, THEN,
WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

15:45.291 --> 15:48.917

NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC TYPE?

KIDDING ME!

I VOTE FOR ONE LAST BONDING
EVENT BEFORE I GO BACK TO
ACADEMIC TORTURE.

16:01.458 --> 16:03.625
WHY NOT?

16:06.166 --> 16:11.291
OK, IN AN EFFORT TO KEEP THIS
MOMENT OF FOLLY UNDER CONTROL,
I'M TAKING CHARGE.

16:11.291 --> 16:15.542
THERE'S 100 QUESTIONS TOTAL,
AND I ONLY HAVE ONE TEST.

16:15.542 --> 16:19.041

NUMBER 22: "HAVE YOU EVER GOTTEN
COZY IN AN AIRPLANE?"

"..IN A PUBLIC PLACE?"

Chris: "..IN YOUR
PARENT'S BED?"

"HAVE YOU EVER CAUGHT
YOUR PARENTS HAVING SEX?"

PARTICIPATED IN.."

17:00.583 --> 17:03.792
"HAVE YOU EVER ENGAGED IN SEXUAL
ACTIVITY WITH A MEMBER OF THE
SAME SEX?"

17:03.792 --> 17:05.708
"...WITH A TRANSVESTITE?"

17:05.708 --> 17:07.040
"...WITH A 4-LEGGED CREATURE?"

17:08.000 --> 17:09.500
"HAVE YOU EVER PAID FOR SEX?"

DOES DINNER COUNT?
QUESTION #84:

17:13.834 --> 17:17.165
"HAVE YOU EVER FANTASIZED ABOUT
A FRIEND'S SIGNIFICANT OTHER?"

ALL OF A SUDDEN.

"HAVE YOU EVER HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH A FRIEND'S SIGNIFICANT

"HAVE YOU EVER HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH A FRIEND'S PET?"

17:33.500 --> 17:34.834
HOW COME I GET ALL THE
ANIMAL QUESTIONS?

17:34.834 --> 17:37.625
OK, #100:

17:40.708 --> 17:42.834
UM, "HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN LOVE?

17:42.834 --> 17:45.917

YOURSELF A POINT OF PURITY FOR
EACH TIME."

IS THIS YOUR VERSION OF SPACE?

18:12.417 --> 18:13.708
YOU'RE FREE TO LEAVE ANYTIME.

18:13.708 --> 18:15.417
I DON'T SEE YOU MAKING
A RUSH FOR THE DOOR.

18:15.417 --> 18:16.250
THAT'S BECAUSE I CAME
HERE TO STUDY.

18:16.250 --> 18:18.291
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING.

18:18.291 --> 18:19.667
IS IT SO AWFUL THAT
I'M HERE?

18:19.667 --> 18:22.375
NO! STOP PUTTING
WORDS INTO MY MOUTH.

18:22.375 --> 18:24.917
I ASKED FOR TIME, DAWSON,
JUST TIME.

18:24.917 --> 18:26.834
PLEASE RESPECT THAT.

18:30.250 --> 18:33.917
ISSUES. DAWSON, RIGHT?

18:33.917 --> 18:37.250
DINA WOLFE HERE,
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T REMEMBER.

18:37.250 --> 18:40.792

THE COFFEE IS?

18:40.792 --> 18:42.834
YEAH, DRIP OR INSTANT?

18:42.834 --> 18:43.792
UM, DRIP.

18:43.792 --> 18:45.166
APPROPRIATE.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.625
TOUGH ROOM.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.375

18:48.375 --> 18:53.959
SO, CARE TO FILL ME IN ON THE
DETAILS OF YOUR LITTLE LOVE
AFFAIR?

18:53.959 --> 18:57.625
ID' RATHER NOT DISCUSS IT,
ACTUALLY, THANKS.

18:57.625 --> 19:01.333
YOU'RE RIGHT, DAWSON.
WHY TALK?

19:01.333 --> 19:05.125
PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME, WE CAN
SAY EVERYTHING WITH A LOOK.

19:11.125 --> 19:17.625
AND THE TOTALS ARE AS FOLLOWS,
CHRIS CLOCKED IN WITH THE LEAST
PURE SCORE OF 66%,

19:17.625 --> 19:20.625
JEN IS A CLOSE SECOND WITH 69%,

19:20.625 --> 19:25.125
JOEY AND DAWSON BRING US UP THE
SCALE WITH A MATCHING LEVEL OF
85%,

19:25.125 --> 19:29.000
AND I ROUND US UP WITH A 92.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
WAIT A MINUTE...
WE'RE MISSING ONE HERE.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.208
IT'S RIGHT HERE.
OH, WHY DIDN'T YOU TURN IT IN?

19:33.208 --> 19:37.166
DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO.
HAND IT OVER.

19:37.166 --> 19:38.333
Chris: YOU DOG!

19:38.333 --> 19:40.875
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH QUESTION #16.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.000
SIXTEEN? I DON'T GET IT.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.583
YEAH, WE BLEW RIGHT PAST IT,

19:44.583 --> 19:46.500
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD READ
IT AGAIN ALOUD.

19:46.500 --> 19:47.667
WHAT DO YOU SAY, PACE?

19:47.667 --> 19:49.583
CHRIS, STOP IT.
COME ON. I'M DYING TO KNOW.

19:49.583 --> 19:50.875
WHAT'D YOU PUT FOR 16, WITTER?

19:50.875 --> 19:52.542
LET'S JUST PUT AN OLD RUMOR
TO REST RIGHT NOW.

19:52.542 --> 19:56.667
IS THERE ANYTHING REDEEMING
ABOUT YOU OTHER THAN YOUR HOUSE?

19:56.667 --> 19:58.291
OUCH.

19:58.291 --> 20:01.291
OK, WILL SOMEONE PLEASE TELL
ME WHAT YOU GUYS ARE TALKING
ABOUT?

20:01.291 --> 20:03.250
OK, I'LL LOOK IT UP MYSELF.

20:03.250 --> 20:09.500
UM, 16: "HAVE YOU EVER HAD SEX
WITH SOMEONE... TWICE YOUR AGE?"

20:09.500 --> 20:12.208
HUH? IT'S A JOKE, RIGHT?

20:12.208 --> 20:14.250
Chris:
WELL, IT'S TRUE AFTER ALL.

20:14.250 --> 20:16.542
WITTER LAID THE PIPE WITH
MISS JACOBS.

20:16.542 --> 20:20.125
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO
CONGRATULATE YOU OR FALL OFF MY
CHAIR.

20:21.291 --> 20:24.625
MISS JACOBS... THE TEACHER
WHO LEFT CAPESIDE?

20:24.625 --> 20:29.166
PACEY... YOU SAID THAT YOU
WERE EMBARRASSINGLY PURE.

20:29.166 --> 20:31.500
THOSE WERE YOUR WORDS, RIGHT?

20:59.542 --> 21:01.875
CHRIS, DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THEY MAY HAVE GONE?

21:01.875 --> 21:04.834
I'M TELLING YOU, THEY'RE OUT
THERE SCREWING AROUND BY NOW.

21:04.834 --> 21:06.458
EVERYONE KNOWS MAKEUP SEX
IS THE BEST KIND.

21:08.041 --> 21:10.750
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.208
DON'T WORRY, BUD.

21:12.208 --> 21:13.583
THE WAY YOU AND JOEY
ARE GOING AT IT,

21:13.583 --> 21:16.208
THERE'S BOUND TO BE SOME
SERIOUS MAKE-UP SEX IN YOUR
FUTURE.

21:19.083 --> 21:19.542
SO...

21:21.834 --> 21:23.083
SO?

21:23.083 --> 21:26.083
HOW AM I DOING?
WITH?

21:26.083 --> 21:28.792
THE LOVELY JEN LINDLEY.
YOU GUYS USED TO DATE.

21:28.792 --> 21:31.166
YOU KNOW HOW SHE THINKS.
SHE LIKES ME, HUH?

21:31.166 --> 21:37.000
WELL, YOU NEVER HAVE HAD MUCH
TROUBLE ATTRACTING THE OPPOSITE
SEX, CHRIS.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.041
YEAH, BUT, UH, JEN'S DIFFERENT.

21:40.041 --> 21:43.792
SHE'S, UH, TOO WITH IT.

21:43.792 --> 21:47.000
CLOSING THE DEAL REQUIRES A
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STRATEGY.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.291
YOU MEAN SLEEPING WITH HER.

21:48.291 --> 21:49.250
NO, I MEAN A HEAVY GAME OF UNO.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.500
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

21:51.500 --> 21:52.542
WE'LL SEE.

21:55.166 --> 21:56.458
YOU KNOW, CHRIS,

21:56.458 --> 22:00.542
JEN IS IN THIS REALLY WEIRD
VULNERABLE STATE RIGHT NOW.

22:00.542 --> 22:01.417
DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT.

22:01.959 --> 22:05.291
RELAX.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.458
WE WON'T DO ANYTHING SHE'S
NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO.

22:07.458 --> 22:08.917
WE'LL SEE.

22:08.917 --> 22:10.500
AH, IF IT'S PROOF YOU NEED,

22:13.792 --> 22:16.166
YOU SEE THAT LIGHT UP THERE
IN THE GUEST HOUSE?

22:16.166 --> 22:18.917
WHEN THAT LIGHT'S OFF,

22:18.917 --> 22:24.458
THAT MEANS I'M INSIDE
WITH JEN...

22:24.458 --> 22:29.875
...LOWERING BOTH OUR PURITY
LEVELS, AND YOU?

22:29.875 --> 22:34.417
YOU'LL BE OUT HERE ALONE.

22:37.792 --> 22:41.166
LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED
TO BORROW A SWIMSUIT.

22:43.708 --> 22:45.250
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS PLACE.

22:45.250 --> 22:49.166
THEY'VE GOT BRAND-NEW SWIMSUITS
JUST FOR VISITORS.

22:49.166 --> 22:50.875
NICE DIGS.

22:50.875 --> 22:53.542
WHAT'S THE MATTER, JO? YOU'RE
NOT GONNA GIVE IN TO A LITTLE
HOT TUB TEMPTATION?

22:53.542 --> 22:56.291
Joey: I'M JUST GONNA
STUDY, THANKS.

22:59.208 --> 23:04.208
YOU KNOW, I REALLY AM SORRY
ABOUT YOU AND DAWSON,

23:04.208 --> 23:05.708
AND I KNOW THAT YOU MAY
NOT BELIEVE IT.

23:05.708 --> 23:07.083
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT!
I DON'T!

23:08.792 --> 23:10.208
THANKS, JOEY.

23:10.208 --> 23:12.834
THANKS FOR MAKING OUR
CONVERSATION JUST AS DELIGHTFUL
AS EVER.

23:12.834 --> 23:15.000
ANYTIME.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.792
YOU KNOW, I USED TO THINK THAT
IT WAS OUR MUTUAL FEELINGS

23:17.792 --> 23:19.333
FOR DAWSON THAT KEPT US APART.

23:19.333 --> 23:22.542
I NEVER REALLY CONSIDERED THE
FACT THAT MAYBE YOU WERE JUST A
BITCH.

23:28.458 --> 23:34.542
LOOK. JEN, I DIDN'T
MEAN TO BE SO HARSH.

23:34.542 --> 23:38.708
GOD, I AM SO SICK OF
TALKING ALL THE TIME.

23:38.708 --> 23:42.542
I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW MY
FEELINGS AND NOT DISCUSS IT.

23:42.542 --> 23:45.583
WE RUN IT INTO THE
GROUND AND...

23:51.333 --> 23:58.542
DON'T YOU JUST WANT TO HAVE
SOMETHING LEFT TO JUST
EXPERIENCE?

24:11.250 --> 24:12.750
AS MUCH AS ANYONE.

24:26.792 --> 24:29.041
I WAS BEGINNING TO THINK YOU
WALKED ALL THE WAY HOME.

24:32.959 --> 24:34.959
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT HER?

24:38.166 --> 24:39.750
IT NEVER CAME UP.

24:39.750 --> 24:43.375
NO GOOD, PACEY.
IT DID, AND YOU LIED.

24:43.375 --> 24:45.333
COME ON, ANDIE,
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

24:45.333 --> 24:47.875
OK, WELL HOW ABOUT FOR STARTERS,

24:47.875 --> 24:52.125
"OH, BEFORE YOU FALL FOR ME,
ANDIE, I SLEPT WITH MY TEACHER."

24:52.125 --> 24:53.667
OH, RIGHT,
THERE'S AN EASY SENTENCE.

24:53.667 --> 24:56.542
IT'S NOT A JOKE, OK?
IT'S SERIOUS.

24:58.583 --> 25:02.125
AND DESPITE YOUR BRAGGART
TENDENCIES, PACEY,

25:02.125 --> 25:05.000
IT'S NOT EXACTLY AN
ADMIRABLE EVENT.

25:06.834 --> 25:09.750
THAT'S NOT FAIR, ANDIE.

25:09.750 --> 25:11.458
YOU'RE JUDGING ME, AND YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

25:11.458 --> 25:16.291
BESIDES, I SLEPT WITH HER,
NOT YOU.

25:18.375 --> 25:21.291
WHY WOULD YOU DO IT, PACEY?
WHY?

25:23.750 --> 25:24.708
SEX.

25:24.708 --> 25:26.000
OH, SO THERE WERE NO
FEELINGS INVOLVED.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.708
OF COURSE THERE WERE FEELINGS
INVOLVED. YOU ASKED WHY.

25:29.708 --> 25:31.625
OK, I TAKE IT BACK.
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYMORE.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.834
YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT.

25:37.834 --> 25:39.083
OF COURSE I'M LIKE THAT!

25:39.083 --> 25:42.291
I'M A SEXUAL CREATURE, ANDIE,
AND SO ARE YOU.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.125
WHY DO YOU THINK WE
TALK ABOUT IT SO MUCH?

25:44.125 --> 25:45.583
WHY DO YOU THINK WE
JOKE ABOUT IT?

25:45.583 --> 25:46.291
WHY DO YOU THINK WE
GIVE EACH OTHER TESTS

25:46.291 --> 25:48.208
TO SEE HOW PURE WE ARE?

25:48.208 --> 25:49.375
NO, NO, NO!
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

25:49.375 --> 25:50.208
THAT'S COMPLETELY INNOCENT.

25:50.208 --> 25:52.291
NO, IT'S NOT!

25:52.291 --> 25:55.125
THE TEST WAS ABOUT SEX,
AND SEX IS NEVER INNOCENT!

25:55.125 --> 25:57.208
IT'S INTENSE, IT'S PASSIONATE,

25:57.208 --> 25:59.166
AND SOMETIMES IT CAN BE
LIFE-ALTERING,

25:59.166 --> 25:59.834
BUT IT'S NEVER INNOCENT, ANDIE,

26:04.041 --> 26:09.583
AND I'M REALLY SORRY IF THIS
CHANGES THE WAY THAT YOU FEEL
ABOUT ME,

26:09.583 --> 26:11.208
BUT I CAN'T CHANGE THAT.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
AND IF THINGS ARE GOING TO
CONTINUE BETWEEN US,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.542
I THINK YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT.

26:33.917 --> 26:36.959
YO JEN! HOT TUB'S READY.

26:38.250 --> 26:39.792
Jen: BE RIGHT DOWN.

26:40.917 --> 26:43.750
JEN, HEY!
DAWSON, WHAT?
YOU'RE NOT GOING IN?

26:43.750 --> 26:47.875
NO, UM, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

26:47.875 --> 26:49.417
YEAH...

26:49.417 --> 26:51.708
I'M WORRIED CHRIS DOESN'T
EXACTLY HAVE THE BEST OF
INTENTIONS HERE.

26:53.708 --> 26:55.083
TELL ME SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW.

26:55.083 --> 26:58.250
YOU'RE AWARE THAT HIS GOAL IS
TO SLEEP WITH YOU TONIGHT?

26:59.750 --> 27:02.625
HE'S A GUY. HE'S 16 AND
HE...

27:02.625 --> 27:04.000
...SEEMS TO FIND ME ATTRACTIVE,

27:04.000 --> 27:07.458
SO YES, I WOULD ASSUME HE'S
GOT SOME SORT OF AGENDA.

27:07.458 --> 27:10.000
AND YOU'RE OK WITH THAT?

27:11.083 --> 27:12.875
JUST BECAUSE HE HAS SOME
SORT OF MASTER PLAN

27:12.875 --> 27:15.750
DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'VE
GOT TO GO ALONG WITH IT.

27:15.750 --> 27:17.291
OK...

27:17.291 --> 27:19.959
FOR THAT MATTER, WHY DO YOU
ASSUME I DON'T HAVE A PLAN
OF MY OWN?

27:19.959 --> 27:21.417
NO-- UH, I JUST--

27:21.417 --> 27:23.834
PSST! GORGEOUS!

27:26.291 --> 27:28.166
WHAT? DO YOU HIDE IN THE VENTS?

27:28.166 --> 27:29.792
SO YOU DATED BOTH OF THEM, HUH?

27:29.792 --> 27:32.375
YOU CERTAINLY DO YOUR RESEARCH.

27:32.375 --> 27:34.542
WHICH ONE'S THE ONE?

27:34.542 --> 27:38.458
ON YOUR TEST, YOU PUT
YOU'D BEEN IN LOVE ONCE.

27:38.458 --> 27:39.500
I'M DYING TO KNOW.

27:39.500 --> 27:42.500
IS IT CAMERON DIAZ
OR JULIA ROBERTS?

27:42.500 --> 27:46.291
HOW DID YOU...
IT'S CALLED AN ANSWER SHEET.

27:46.291 --> 27:48.208
IT'S CALLED... HERE!

27:48.208 --> 27:48.834
GIVE ME THAT.

27:48.834 --> 27:52.000
WAIT.
NOT SO FAST!

27:52.000 --> 27:54.875
I HAVE ONE YOU WANT
MUCH MORE.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.708
JOEY'S?

27:57.708 --> 28:01.250
SHE PUTS A LITTLE
SMILEY FACE IN HER O'S.

28:01.250 --> 28:02.708
KIND OF MAKES ME
WANT TO PUKE.

28:02.708 --> 28:04.166
LET ME SEE IT.

28:04.166 --> 28:07.000
NOT SO FAST,
THIS TOLL HAS A FEE.

28:07.000 --> 28:07.875
OK. WHAT?

28:10.750 --> 28:13.583
[SCOFFS]
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

28:13.583 --> 28:15.667
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

28:19.333 --> 28:22.834
I THINK YOU'LL FIND HER LAST
ANSWER RATHER INTERESTING.

28:22.834 --> 28:25.834
SEEMS WHILE YOU'VE ONLY
BEEN IN LOVE ONCE,

28:25.834 --> 28:27.542
ACCORDING TO YOU-KNOW-WHO'S
ANSWER SHEET,

28:27.542 --> 28:29.792
SHE'S BEEN IN LOVE... TWICE.

28:35.250 --> 28:40.083
[LAUGHING] ALL RIGHT, THAT'S
ENOUGH. IT'S TIME TO STUDY.

28:40.083 --> 28:44.625
NO, NO. RELAX.
WE'RE IN A HOT TUB.

28:44.625 --> 28:46.125
STUDYING'S NOT PERMITTED.

28:46.125 --> 28:50.417
REALLY? THEN, WHAT IS?
THIS.

28:57.792 --> 29:02.959
AND... WHAT IF I DON'T
WANT TO MESS AROUND?

29:04.333 --> 29:05.000
THEN WE WON'T.

29:07.542 --> 29:13.375
JEN, I'M NOT A BAD GUY.
I JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN.

29:13.375 --> 29:15.000
WELL, THEN TELL ME,

29:15.000 --> 29:20.750
CHRISTOPHER ROBBIN,
WHAT IS YOUR IDEA OF FUN?

29:21.166 --> 29:22.667
THIS.

29:31.417 --> 29:34.959
SO, JEN...
ARE WE ON THE SAME PAGE?

29:36.417 --> 29:37.875
SAME PAGE.

30:00.667 --> 30:04.917
IS SHE OK?
YEAH. SHE'LL BE FINE.

30:04.917 --> 30:07.417
SHE JUST WANTS TO BE ALONE
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW?

30:08.208 --> 30:10.208
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST WRITE "NO"?

30:13.208 --> 30:14.834
I DIDN'T WANT TO LIE TO HER.

30:16.583 --> 30:18.667
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE?

30:20.166 --> 30:22.166
I'D LIKE TO THINK I WOULD
HAVE BEEN HONEST.

30:24.125 --> 30:25.375
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S...

30:25.375 --> 30:28.333
...I SEEM TO HAVE TROUBLE SAYING
A LOT OF THINGS LATELY.

30:31.083 --> 30:34.875
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHAT?

30:36.083 --> 30:37.667
TRY HARDER.

30:51.083 --> 30:55.041
LOOK, NO MORE ROUNDS TONIGHT,
DAWSON. I AM SO TIRED.

30:55.041 --> 30:57.083
I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET
5 MINUTES OF STUDYING IN.

31:00.333 --> 31:02.250
JO, I THOUGHT WHAT WE HAD
WAS SPECIAL.

31:02.250 --> 31:06.750
LOOK, I'M SERIOUS. I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING BUT THIS.

31:06.750 --> 31:08.792
YOU WROTE THAT YOU HAVE
BEEN IN LOVE TWICE.

31:11.333 --> 31:12.792
YOU LOOKED AT MY TEST?!

31:12.792 --> 31:14.291
NO, I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON ABOUT
INVADING YOUR PRIVACY.

31:14.291 --> 31:17.875
CHRIS'S SISTER WAS KIND ENOUGH
TO IMPART THAT INFORMATION.

31:17.875 --> 31:19.959
JOEY, YOU SAID THAT
I WAS YOUR WORLD.

31:19.959 --> 31:22.208
WHEN DID YOU HAVE TIME
FOR GUY #2?

31:22.208 --> 31:23.208
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
SHALLOW ENOUGH

31:23.208 --> 31:25.667
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH JACK
AFTER ONE KISS.

31:25.667 --> 31:27.166
LOOK, STOP IT!
I DON'T UNDERSTAND!

31:27.166 --> 31:28.542
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW, OK?!

31:28.542 --> 31:30.375
WHY CAN'T WE GO BACK
TO THE WAY THINGS WERE?

31:30.375 --> 31:31.917
WHY CAN'T WE
JUST BE FRIENDS, DAWSON?

31:31.917 --> 31:33.458
THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU WANT?
YES!

31:33.458 --> 31:34.542
AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH, JUST FRIENDS?

31:34.542 --> 31:36.834
YEAH.

31:36.834 --> 31:38.041
IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY THAT CAN'T HAPPEN,

31:38.041 --> 31:42.041
IF YOU DON'T GET THAT,
YOU DON'T GET ME!

31:51.708 --> 31:56.041
VERY EMOTIONAL.
OSCAR NOMINATING. REALLY.

31:56.583 --> 31:58.792
GO AWAY.

32:00.083 --> 32:02.959
DAWSON, YOU AREN'T CRYING,
ARE YOU?

32:02.959 --> 32:05.750
YOU WANTED A KISS.
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

32:05.750 --> 32:08.208
ARE YOU PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING
THAT COMES WITH THAT KISS?

32:08.208 --> 32:10.250
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T JUST END
WITH A FADE OUT.

32:10.250 --> 32:12.458
THERE ARE REPERCUSSIONS.
HEARTS GET BROKEN.

32:12.458 --> 32:13.708
FRIENDSHIPS GET RUINED.

32:13.708 --> 32:15.959
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE COULD
FALL APART BECAUSE OF ONE KISS.

32:15.959 --> 32:17.834
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK
FORWARD TO.

32:17.834 --> 32:20.417
DO YOURSELF A BIG FAVOR...
DON'T RUSH IT.

33:06.542 --> 33:07.125
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

33:07.125 --> 33:08.834
Joey: KNOCK, KNOCK.

33:08.834 --> 33:10.083
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

33:12.375 --> 33:15.208
TO HANG OUT WITH THE ONLY SANE
INDIVIDUAL HERE.

33:17.792 --> 33:19.083
HE'S SO MEAN.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.458
ALL BOYS ARE.

33:23.458 --> 33:26.834
IT'S THEIR EASIEST WAY
OF EXPRESSING THEMSELVES.

33:26.834 --> 33:31.083
AFTER TONIGHT, I'M AVOIDING
GROWING UP AT ALL COSTS.

33:31.083 --> 33:33.125
SOUNDS GOOD. LET ME KNOW
IF YOU HAVE ANY LUCK.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.250
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
ARGUING THE OTHER SIDE?

33:39.250 --> 33:41.959
CONVINCING ME THAT
GROWING UP CAN BE

33:41.959 --> 33:44.667
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE
IF I JUST LET IT?

33:44.667 --> 33:46.458
I SEE.

33:46.458 --> 33:49.458
YOU WANT THE "I'M OLDER THAN
YOU, SO HERE'S HOW IT WORKS"
SPEECH?

33:50.667 --> 33:53.834
HOW'S THIS?
GROWING UP SUCKS.

33:53.834 --> 33:55.375
NOT ALL KISSES ARE MAGIC,

33:55.375 --> 33:58.875
AND MOST BOYS DO NOT LIVE UP
TO YOUR EXPECTATIONS,

34:01.458 --> 34:08.083
BUT THERE ARE THOSE TIMES WHEN
EVERYTHING, I MEAN LOVE,

34:08.083 --> 34:10.458
ROMANCE, RELATIONSHIPS,

34:10.458 --> 34:15.166
IT ALL FALLS TOGETHER PERFECTLY
AND IT'S INCREDIBLE.

34:17.041 --> 34:21.542
IT'S THOSE MOMENTS, NO MATTER
HOW DEPRESSINGLY FEW AND FAR
BETWEEN,

34:21.542 --> 34:22.208
THAT MAKE GROWING UP WORTH IT.

34:24.625 --> 34:27.041
YOU'LL BE OK.

38:00.333 --> 38:01.375
I'LL BUY IT.

38:01.375 --> 38:03.500
BROMDAMING!
BROMDAMING!

38:03.500 --> 38:05.667
BROBDINGNAGIANS.

38:05.667 --> 38:08.667
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS,
WE'RE DONE,

38:08.667 --> 38:10.750
BUT I GOT ONE LAST
GROUP ACTIVITY.

38:43.917 --> 38:45.583
HEY.

38:45.583 --> 38:48.333
WOW. YOU REALLY TOOK
CONTROL IN THERE.

38:48.333 --> 38:50.333
YOU HAVE AN INTERESTING WAY
OF DOING THAT.

38:50.333 --> 38:52.417
YEAH, WELL, I PERFORM WELL
UNDER PRESSURE.

38:52.417 --> 38:54.291
I WANT TO EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO YOU.

38:54.291 --> 38:56.333
YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT THIS, ANDIE.

38:56.333 --> 38:57.667
I DO, PACEY.

38:57.667 --> 39:00.917
I MEAN, I'M THE QUEEN OF
KEEPING DIRTY SECRETS.

39:00.917 --> 39:05.250
SO I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DIDN'T
JUMP FORWARD WITH THE
INFORMATION.

39:05.250 --> 39:07.750
I THINK I WAS JUST MORE
SHOCKED BY THE IDEA

39:07.750 --> 39:14.125
THAT YOU HAVE SO MUCH
EXPERIENCE AND I, UM...

39:14.125 --> 39:17.166
WILL.

39:17.166 --> 39:19.667
YOU'RE SUCH A JERK!
A SLACKER JERK.

39:19.667 --> 39:25.875
A CHAMPION SLACKER JERK.
AND WHAT DOES THAT MAKE YOU?

39:25.875 --> 39:28.041
I DON'T KNOW, PACEY.
YOU TELL ME.

39:28.041 --> 39:29.500
I DARE YOU.

39:30.834 --> 39:36.333
YOU, ANDIE McPHEE, ARE THE GIRL
THAT I LOVE TO HATE.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.542
I LOVE TO HATE YOU, TOO.

39:47.875 --> 39:49.583
[SIGHS]

39:49.583 --> 39:50.792
NOT FORGIVEN.
IT'S A NO?

39:55.208 --> 39:55.542
HEY.

39:57.333 --> 40:01.667
HEY.
CAN WE TALK?

40:06.083 --> 40:08.333
SURE.

40:11.375 --> 40:13.291
DO ME A FAVOR AND DON'T SAY
ANYTHING, OK?

40:13.291 --> 40:15.291
EVERY TIME WE SPEAK,
I ALWAYS SCREW THIS UP.

40:15.291 --> 40:17.583
JUST PLEASE LISTEN.

40:18.083 --> 40:21.417
OK?

40:21.417 --> 40:24.875
ALL I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
LATELY IS HOW MUCH I WANT TO
TAKE BACK OUR FIRST KISS.

40:24.875 --> 40:28.750
HOW MUCH I WOULD PAY TO JUST LET
YOU CLIMB THROUGH THAT WINDOW.

40:28.750 --> 40:32.417
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS WHAT
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED?

40:32.417 --> 40:34.083
MAYBE WE'D STILL
BE BEST FRIENDS.

40:34.083 --> 40:35.875
MAYBE YOU'D EVEN STILL
HAVE A THING FOR ME.

40:35.875 --> 40:39.875
I JUST KNOW THAT I
WOULDN'T BE HURTING LIKE THIS.

40:43.125 --> 40:45.000
BUT THEN I THINK ABOUT...

40:46.083 --> 40:48.917
...EVERYTHING THAT KISS
BROUGHT INTO MY LIFE.

40:48.917 --> 40:52.792
WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO LOOK AT YOU
AND KNOW NOT JUST WHAT YOU WERE
THINKING,

40:52.792 --> 40:56.333
BUT ALSO WHAT YOU WERE FEELING
BECAUSE I WAS FEELING THE SAME
THING,

40:58.417 --> 41:00.250
AND THEN IT'S WORTH IT.

41:02.458 --> 41:04.500
IT'S WORTH ALL THE PAIN
THAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

41:04.500 --> 41:08.375
I WANT TO REGRET KISSING YOU,
JOEY, BUT I CAN'T.

41:09.375 --> 41:12.291
IT WAS THE SMARTEST DECISION
I EVER MADE.

41:14.959 --> 41:19.291
DAWSON, THE TWO TIMES I
FELL IN LOVE,

41:19.291 --> 41:23.708
ON THE TEST,
THEY WERE BOTH YOU.

41:25.959 --> 41:29.959
I MEAN, THE FIRST TIME
I FELL WAS FOR MY FRIEND,

41:29.959 --> 41:32.458
THE DAWSON I GREW UP WITH,
THE BOY ACROSS THE CREEK,

41:32.458 --> 41:35.625
AND THE SECOND TIME
WAS AFTER WE KISSED.

41:35.625 --> 41:38.959
I MEAN, YOU BECAME THIS
WHOLE NEW PERSON TO ME AND...

41:38.959 --> 41:42.250
I FELL IN LOVE ALL OVER AGAIN.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.750
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER ANYMORE

41:44.750 --> 41:46.750
DOES NOT CHANGE
MY FEELINGS FOR YOU, DAWSON.

41:46.750 --> 41:49.750
IT'S ME I'M UNSURE OF.

41:52.834 --> 41:54.834
JOEY, I'M GOING TO GIVE
YOU THAT SPACE.

41:56.333 --> 42:02.333
NO HOSTILITY, NO UNDERHANDED
COMMENTS, JUST SPACE.

42:02.333 --> 42:04.917
BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE
WAY I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

42:07.208 --> 42:07.834
NOTHING CAN CHANGE THAT.

42:48.208 --> 42:48.834
COME ON, DAWSON!
LET'S GO!

43:07.375 --> 43:11.417
"DEAR CLASS, SOMETIMES
PREPARATION TEACHES YOU MORE
THAN THE EXAM ITSELF THEREFORE,

43:11.417 --> 43:13.834
YOU HAVE MORE OF IT.

43:13.834 --> 43:16.417
MY ILLNESS HAS CLAIMED ME FOR
ANOTHER DAY. TEST RESCHEDULED."

43:16.417 --> 43:17.834
[ALL SIGH]

43:17.834 --> 43:21.500
WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE CRAMMED
ALL NIGHT FOR NOTHING.

43:21.500 --> 43:23.500
NOW WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

43:23.500 --> 43:25.291
GO TO OUR OTHER CLASSES,
I GUESS.

43:25.291 --> 43:28.417
ACTUALLY, NO.
I GOT ONE LAST GROUP ACTIVITY.

43:28.417 --> 43:29.917
FOLLOW ME.
