WEBVTT

00:01.803 --> 00:03.037
This is so gross.

00:03.171 --> 00:05.373
I don't understand why they
don't just hire an exterminator.

00:05.507 --> 00:07.708
It's like, what is my rent
even going to?

00:07.843 --> 00:09.710
Well, they gave you the
bug bombs for free, right?

00:09.845 --> 00:11.212
Yeah, great, so, like,
everyone in the building

00:11.346 --> 00:13.547
can just, like, mass murder
all their own cockroaches?

00:13.682 --> 00:14.615
Ridiculous.

00:14.750 --> 00:16.450
Coming up on
1600 hours here.

00:16.551 --> 00:18.486
No, 4:00 p.m. sharp, are you
kidding?

00:18.587 --> 00:20.287
Everyone in the building is
doing it at 4:00 p.m. sharp.

00:20.389 --> 00:22.223
That-- that's what
that is, 4:00.

00:22.324 --> 00:23.924
Okay, I knew that.

00:23.992 --> 00:25.126
Zero dark thirty!

00:25.227 --> 00:26.894
Zero dark 29!

00:26.962 --> 00:28.763
Zero dark 28!

00:28.897 --> 00:30.898
Zero dark 27!

00:31.033 --> 00:32.700
Zero dark 26!

00:32.868 --> 00:34.435
... Zero dark three!

00:34.536 --> 00:36.504
Zero dark two!

00:36.605 --> 00:37.738
Zero dark one!

00:37.873 --> 00:39.774
Zero dark zero!

Go, go, go!

Oh.

00:53.522 --> 00:55.756
Hey.
What's up, Jer?

00:55.891 --> 00:56.957
That's crazy.

00:57.059 --> 00:57.958
Nothing like the smell of
a million dead bugs in the

00:58.060 --> 00:59.260
morning, right?
I know.

00:59.394 --> 01:01.996
It's like an insect holocaust
in here or something.

01:02.097 --> 01:05.933
It would make us
Mr. and Mrs. Hit-- Hitler.

01:06.001 --> 01:08.002
Like Nazis?
Yeah, like the--

01:08.170 --> 01:11.005
I mean, I just was--
Yeah, have a good 24 hours.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.373
I wouldn't--

01:12.474 --> 01:14.442
(coughing violently)

01:14.543 --> 01:15.943
It's in my mouth!

01:16.044 --> 01:17.878
♪ Four and the
and two and one, one ♪

01:23.051 --> 01:25.719
And another thing, I know
a girl who returned a vacuum

01:25.787 --> 01:29.023
after three years of
using it, dude.

01:29.091 --> 01:30.724
They just gave
her her money back.

01:30.792 --> 01:32.193
They really care about
their customers.

01:32.294 --> 01:34.361
Okay, Ab, you know, you're
spending the entire weekend

01:34.463 --> 01:36.163
at my place, just--

01:36.298 --> 01:37.932
Spread out the Bed Bath
& Beyond lectures.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.366
I love the place, you know?
I just.

01:39.468 --> 01:41.569
Yeah, fine, I just have a lot
more to say about it, so.

01:41.703 --> 01:44.171
Great, you should tell me more
while I transform my room

01:44.306 --> 01:45.473
into a walk-in closet.

01:45.540 --> 01:46.841
Dude, you're not doing
the pole right now.

01:46.975 --> 01:48.843
It's gonna take
me ten minutes, dude.

01:48.977 --> 01:51.912
Okay, it's gonna take you three
months, like everything does.

01:52.047 --> 01:53.380
Did you forget about my art show?
No, no.

01:53.482 --> 01:54.381
This is a big deal.

01:54.516 --> 01:56.050
Your first gallery
opening is...

01:56.184 --> 01:58.119
I mean, this is the
biggest moment of our lives.

01:58.253 --> 01:59.587
It's my life, but--

01:59.688 --> 02:00.888
I mean, you're with--
you're with me.

02:01.022 --> 02:02.256
So when we get inside,
I'm gonna shower first, okay,

02:02.357 --> 02:05.759
and then I'm gonna pluck my
eyebrows, get my make-up on.

02:05.927 --> 02:07.995
I'll Nair, like, a bunch
of different areas.

02:08.163 --> 02:09.630
Maybe you could massage my
shoulders for a second, but,

02:09.731 --> 02:11.966
like, not like last time
'cause that wasn't cool.

02:12.100 --> 02:15.269
Abbi,
I have some bad news,

02:15.337 --> 02:18.472
but it's white people
problems, so let's see if you

02:18.573 --> 02:19.974
can keep it in
perspective.

02:20.075 --> 02:23.444
I-- I don't have my key.

02:23.545 --> 02:25.679
Okay, first of all,
I'm allowed to be upset

02:25.814 --> 02:27.848
even though I'm white.
Typical honky.

02:27.916 --> 02:29.250
All right, we don't have time
to be locked out.

02:29.384 --> 02:30.718
Is Jaime home?

02:30.852 --> 02:32.987
He is in Vermont
for a straight wedding.

02:33.121 --> 02:35.222
Let's just call a locksmith.
No, I'm not calling a locksmith.

02:35.390 --> 02:36.924
They take forever
to get here.

02:37.058 --> 02:38.926
I think we can get in--
We have street smarts.

02:39.027 --> 02:40.194
All right, there's got
to be at least, like,

02:40.262 --> 02:41.996
one person home in
your building, right?

02:42.130 --> 02:43.364
Yeah, just a--
Hey, don't, don't--

02:43.465 --> 02:45.799
Use the wood, dude.
Oh, my God, all right.

02:45.901 --> 02:48.269
Wood, I mean...

02:48.336 --> 02:50.437
(electric buzzing)
Jesus!

02:50.539 --> 02:52.773
Okay, okay, you need
to move at some point.

02:52.908 --> 02:54.909
I know.
All right.

02:55.010 --> 02:57.111
Where's your fire escape?

02:57.245 --> 02:59.847
Okay, hands on my shoulders
on three.

02:59.948 --> 03:01.448
One, two...

03:03.685 --> 03:04.585
Jesus.

03:04.686 --> 03:06.120
Sorry,
I released too early.

03:06.288 --> 03:07.621
Okay, we got this.

03:07.756 --> 03:09.590
One, two...

03:09.758 --> 03:11.358
Okay.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.661
Okay.
Okay.

03:13.762 --> 03:16.931
(grunting)
Just one pull-up.

03:17.098 --> 03:19.667
I should be supporting myself--
dude, I work at a gym.

03:19.801 --> 03:22.803
There are so many
upper-body strength classes.

03:22.871 --> 03:24.505
Okay, you got it?

03:24.606 --> 03:25.472
You got it?

03:25.574 --> 03:26.607
Do you have me?
Here, I got you.

03:26.741 --> 03:27.641
Okay.

03:27.742 --> 03:29.877
I don't think it's
gonna work out.

03:29.978 --> 03:33.347
(laughing)
That was my bad, dude.

03:33.448 --> 03:34.648
Okay, you just, like--

03:34.783 --> 03:36.784
You just went up
inside me.

03:36.918 --> 03:38.752
Okay.
That's just what happened.

03:38.820 --> 03:40.120
It was honestly
not intentional.

03:40.255 --> 03:42.056
It was natural for me.

03:42.224 --> 03:45.593
Okay, who would you rather
have go down on you?

03:45.694 --> 03:49.597
Michael Buble
or Janet Jackson?

03:49.698 --> 03:51.699
Oh, okay.

03:51.833 --> 03:54.034
What Buble are we
talking about, though?

03:54.169 --> 03:55.836
I don't know, the optimal
Michael Buble.

03:55.971 --> 03:57.271
His weight fluctuates.

03:57.372 --> 03:58.706
Yeah.
So does hers.

03:58.807 --> 04:00.207
Yeah.
So does mine.

04:00.308 --> 04:01.909
Yeah.
But then again,

04:02.010 --> 04:03.844
Michael Buble is,
like, such a crooner.

04:03.945 --> 04:05.946
I feel like he could do
stuff with his mouth that,

04:06.014 --> 04:08.148
like, most people
couldn't.

04:11.286 --> 04:13.153
Somebody call
a locksmith?

04:15.357 --> 04:19.059
Yeah.

04:19.194 --> 04:21.362
I'm gonna look disgusting
for tonight is all.

04:21.463 --> 04:24.298
No, you're gonna
look hot and cool.

04:24.399 --> 04:26.300
Your shower is just
a lockpick away.

04:26.401 --> 04:27.801
Very hot.

04:27.902 --> 04:30.371
Very cool.

04:30.505 --> 04:32.172
What's your name,
sweetheart?

04:32.307 --> 04:33.907
Uh...

04:34.009 --> 04:35.809
Yolanda.

04:35.944 --> 04:38.012
Yolanda.

04:38.179 --> 04:39.613
So where is it
you sleep?

04:39.681 --> 04:41.148
What?

04:41.283 --> 04:43.250
Which apartment's yours?

04:43.351 --> 04:44.818
Um...

04:44.886 --> 04:46.787
Do you have any, like,
credentials?

04:46.888 --> 04:48.756
Or, like, a license to be
a locksmith that you could

04:48.857 --> 04:50.324
just show us?

04:50.492 --> 04:52.293
No, the only thing you
need to be a locksmith is

04:52.460 --> 04:54.662
you gotta want it.

04:54.796 --> 04:56.363
Real bad.

04:59.801 --> 05:01.535
That one.

05:01.636 --> 05:02.903
Yeah, it's this one,
the 6--

05:03.038 --> 05:05.005
6C.

05:11.713 --> 05:15.582
(amorous groaning)

05:18.053 --> 05:20.788
They call this
a whore door.

05:20.889 --> 05:23.657
'Cause it's so easy.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.159
Okay.

05:25.226 --> 05:29.730
Thank you for your
terrifying services

05:29.864 --> 05:31.965
and don't call us,
we'll call you.

05:32.133 --> 05:33.634
Oh yeah.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.605
Oh, you'll call me, huh?

05:42.944 --> 05:44.511
(whistling)

05:50.118 --> 05:51.352
God.

05:51.486 --> 05:54.388
Look at this gorgeous
immigrant family.

05:54.522 --> 05:55.789
At least
they're not home.

05:55.924 --> 05:57.458
How do I not know them?
I don't know.

05:57.559 --> 06:01.095
New Yorkers don't usually
know their neighbors.

06:01.196 --> 06:02.496
Except for me and Jeremy,

06:02.630 --> 06:04.531
just 'cause that's
a special relationship.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.567
Yeah, I would know
Jeremy, too.

06:06.668 --> 06:09.737
I'd know him in and up
and all around.

06:09.838 --> 06:13.173
Cute little
Mexican candies.

06:13.241 --> 06:18.679
They're Nerds.

06:18.780 --> 06:19.747
I am the problem.

06:19.848 --> 06:22.783
I am gentrification,
you know.

06:22.884 --> 06:24.752
In three generations,
gentrification is gonna be a

06:24.853 --> 06:26.787
non-issue because
statistically,

06:26.921 --> 06:28.522
we're headed toward an age
where everybody's gonna be like

06:28.623 --> 06:30.491
caramel and queer and
everybody's gonna live

06:30.558 --> 06:32.259
where they're gonna--
(doorknob turning)

06:35.864 --> 06:37.164
What the hell is this?

06:37.232 --> 06:38.432
I live next door,
I live here!

06:38.566 --> 06:39.700
I've never
seen you before!

06:39.834 --> 06:41.502
We got locked out and I was
gonna make my room

06:41.636 --> 06:43.203
a walk-in closet and--
Robbers!

06:43.304 --> 06:45.172
(screaming)

06:48.411 --> 06:49.578
I'm gonna shoot you
in your face!

06:49.679 --> 06:50.612
Wait, wait!

06:50.713 --> 06:52.147
I can prove that
I live here, okay?

06:52.248 --> 06:53.382
Uh...

06:53.483 --> 06:55.517
Three-- three months ago,
that old white dude

06:55.585 --> 06:57.085
was found chopped up
in our dumpster.

06:57.186 --> 06:59.321
That happens all the time in Gowanus.
Okay.

06:59.422 --> 07:02.090
Last week, one of you
farted and I heard it

07:02.225 --> 07:03.759
'cause the walls are
so thin and I laughed

07:03.926 --> 07:06.762
and then you heard me,
so you laughed.

07:06.896 --> 07:08.530
That did happen.

07:08.664 --> 07:09.865
Why are you
in our apartment then?

07:09.966 --> 07:13.502
We got locked out and we
called this locksmith

07:13.636 --> 07:16.238
and he was really
scary, he was so creepy.

07:16.339 --> 07:18.707
We couldn't let him
into our apartment,

07:18.775 --> 07:22.811
so we had him let us
in, uh, to your--

07:22.945 --> 07:24.513
Unbelievable!

07:24.680 --> 07:27.983
Now that I say it out loud, I
realize I led the creepy dude

07:28.084 --> 07:31.319
to your apartment
and I am so sorry.

07:31.454 --> 07:34.122
I'm so sorry.

07:34.257 --> 07:36.758
'Cause of the--
I threw up.

07:36.859 --> 07:38.927
'Cause of the--
It was because of the mace.

07:38.995 --> 07:40.195
'Cause I never thought--

07:40.329 --> 07:42.564
I haven't thrown up in like
a year, I'm so sorry.

07:44.834 --> 07:46.468
Oh, yes.
Oh.

07:46.602 --> 07:47.869
Oh, my God.

07:48.004 --> 07:49.471
I'm sorry I got you maced.

07:49.605 --> 07:50.705
That's okay.

07:50.807 --> 07:51.940
It's not your fault.

07:52.041 --> 07:54.409
We're just technically
homeless right now, so.

07:54.477 --> 07:57.446
Ben Affleck was homeless
for a night for charity.

07:57.547 --> 08:00.882
We're, like, doing that,
just involuntarily.

08:01.017 --> 08:03.351
Yeah, we're just
a regular Matt and Ben.

08:03.486 --> 08:05.053
Exactly what's happening.

08:14.097 --> 08:16.231
(beeping)

08:21.537 --> 08:24.039
(beeping)

08:29.445 --> 08:30.479
Oh, God.

08:30.613 --> 08:32.847
I am--
I'm so sorry.

08:35.818 --> 08:36.885
Listen, don't mess
this up for me.

08:37.019 --> 08:38.486
I'm gonna be
a teacher here one day.

08:38.587 --> 08:40.956
We are just gonna shower really
quick and get to the gallery,

08:41.057 --> 08:43.558
and honestly, probably look
better than if we hadn't been

08:43.693 --> 08:45.794
maced 'cause our pores are
tight and burning.

08:45.928 --> 08:47.129
It's like we had
a chemical peel.

08:47.230 --> 08:49.397
I-- I highly doubt that, so
going right to the locker room,

08:49.499 --> 08:52.667
if anyone sees me, it's gonna be a whole thing.
Okay, okay, okay.

08:52.802 --> 08:55.003
Oh, my God,
there's Trey.

08:55.104 --> 08:56.938
Gonna really feel it in
those glutes, okay?

08:57.073 --> 08:58.874
Okay, give me your stuff,
give me your stuff.

08:59.008 --> 09:01.676
I'm out, I'm out,
I'm out, I'm out.

09:01.777 --> 09:03.712
(Trey)
Hey, Ab.

09:03.846 --> 09:05.981
Hey.

09:06.115 --> 09:07.849
Trey, I didn't think--
Whoa.

09:07.950 --> 09:09.217
What happened to your face?

09:09.352 --> 09:13.054
Oh, it's-- It's really
embarrassing, actually.

09:13.122 --> 09:16.458
I was-- I was doing
parkour just now.

09:16.592 --> 09:17.659
Abbi, that's great.

09:17.727 --> 09:19.895
Using the city as your gym,
very solstice.

09:19.996 --> 09:23.031
I did a backflip...
off of a car

09:23.166 --> 09:25.800
and I fell right
into a fire hydrant.

09:25.902 --> 09:27.669
That's-- It's a pretty
advanced technique.

09:27.803 --> 09:29.971
You can't take a break from
fitness, that's what I say.

09:30.039 --> 09:32.307
To myself.
I wish I was as strong as you.

09:32.475 --> 09:35.076
I mean, sometimes I just go
to Quizno's and I go nuts.

09:35.211 --> 09:36.077
It's bad.

09:36.212 --> 09:37.512
Quizno's is
my guilty pleasure.

09:37.647 --> 09:39.114
Dennis, relax that face,
buddy, okay?

09:39.215 --> 09:40.448
Relax that face.

09:40.583 --> 09:42.751
While I'm here, you know what,
I should check out the locker

09:42.885 --> 09:45.554
room just to make sure that
it's, like, up to code,

09:45.655 --> 09:48.857
nice and clean, just the way you
like it, I'm gonna check it out.

09:48.991 --> 09:50.358
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Ab.

09:50.493 --> 09:52.394
I know what
this is really about.

09:52.528 --> 09:54.029
You're afraid of your
own failure.

09:54.197 --> 09:57.065
Abbi, parkour
is terrifying, I know.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.401
But you've got to get back
on that urban jungle.

09:59.535 --> 10:00.869
I guess so.

10:01.003 --> 10:02.537
I'm glad to hear you say that
'cause I'm gonna walk you out

10:02.605 --> 10:04.472
and watch you do it, all right, come on.
Okay.

10:04.540 --> 10:06.241
Dennis, keep squatting,
I'm gonna do some parkour.

10:10.079 --> 10:15.650
(classical music playing)

10:28.631 --> 10:29.898
Kiehl's.

10:33.636 --> 10:35.971
Oh, yeah.

10:54.223 --> 10:55.624
All right, you speak
parkour, right?

10:55.758 --> 10:57.559
Yeah, totally.
Awesome.

10:57.693 --> 10:59.294
Show me a tic-tac
on the hydrant.

10:59.462 --> 11:00.729
Come on.
Okay, tic-tac.

11:00.863 --> 11:01.730
Yeah.

11:01.864 --> 11:05.100
Um...

11:05.201 --> 11:06.167
Okay.

11:06.302 --> 11:07.402
That's--
That's pretty good.

11:07.536 --> 11:08.937
Do a cat pass
under the hood.

11:09.105 --> 11:10.171
Cat pass?
Do a cat pass.

11:10.306 --> 11:11.473
Okay.

11:15.311 --> 11:16.344
Beautiful.

11:16.512 --> 11:17.779
I want you to tic-tac
right over the car.

11:17.913 --> 11:19.014
Tic-tac right over.

11:19.148 --> 11:20.482
Abbi, you're overcoming
your fear, all right?

11:20.583 --> 11:21.483
Don't give up now, Abbi.

11:21.651 --> 11:22.484
You've got this.

11:22.618 --> 11:24.185
Arch that back,
arch that back.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.487
That's a good hostage,
okay.

11:25.588 --> 11:27.188
Come down
and do a spit roast.

11:27.323 --> 11:28.390
You know what?

11:28.524 --> 11:30.725
Your full body is involved,
so that's good.

11:30.826 --> 11:32.327
Beautiful, Abbi.

11:32.495 --> 11:33.328
Picabo Street.

11:33.429 --> 11:35.497
Abbi, you are
a natural traceur.

11:35.631 --> 11:37.799
I want to see a jack in
the pulpit in the bikes.

11:37.867 --> 11:39.134
Jack in the pulpit.
Yeah.

11:39.268 --> 11:41.770
Totally.
Okay, yeah, pump it.

11:41.871 --> 11:42.771
It's very Grecian.

11:42.872 --> 11:44.773
Tap, tap, tap, tap,
good.

11:44.874 --> 11:47.475
Now I want you to do a Kong
jump and a back handspring

11:47.610 --> 11:50.545
off the car, but don't let
me anticipate the movement.

11:50.680 --> 11:55.317
You know, I-- I bet you that
Dennis is not squatting anymore.

11:55.418 --> 11:56.951
Anticipation.

11:57.086 --> 11:59.287
Abbi, that's the makings
of a great trainer.

11:59.388 --> 12:01.022
I think that I know--
Thank God I am one.

12:01.123 --> 12:02.390
Hasta la vista, Abbi.

12:02.558 --> 12:03.425
Dennis!

12:03.526 --> 12:05.527
♪

12:07.263 --> 12:08.663
We are officially
homeless.

12:08.764 --> 12:10.899
No, dude, we are
standing and awake.

12:10.966 --> 12:14.769
You gotta be lying down
to be really homeless.

12:14.870 --> 12:16.371
Sorry.

12:16.539 --> 12:18.306
Or officially dicks.

12:18.441 --> 12:21.076
You know what?
This is insane.

12:21.210 --> 12:22.243
I'm changing here, just,
like, cover me.

12:22.411 --> 12:24.579
This is, like,
getting to be ridiculous.

12:24.714 --> 12:26.047
Okay.

12:26.182 --> 12:28.817
Oh, my God.

12:28.918 --> 12:30.585
Ilana.

12:30.720 --> 12:33.555
What did you do?

12:33.656 --> 12:35.490
That solstice, like...

12:35.591 --> 12:37.258
They should, like,
give you containers for--

12:37.360 --> 12:40.195
You know, for--
For what? Stealing lotion?

12:40.296 --> 12:42.197
What did you put it in?

12:42.331 --> 12:44.699
Those, like, plastic bags.

12:44.834 --> 12:45.767
Okay.

12:45.901 --> 12:47.502
The plastic bags are for
swimsuits and, like,

12:47.603 --> 12:51.272
dirty gym clothes,
not for loose goo.

12:51.374 --> 12:53.608
Just an FYI, okay?

12:53.743 --> 12:55.443
This is just insane.
I know.

12:55.578 --> 12:58.680
I can't believe that I'm gonna
go to my first gallery show

12:58.748 --> 13:00.582
looking like this.

13:00.683 --> 13:02.217
You're ruining
my big break.

13:02.351 --> 13:04.786
I mean, look-- look at me,
I look like garbage.

13:04.887 --> 13:06.788
You know what?
I'm going in.

13:06.922 --> 13:08.823
Wait.
What?

13:08.958 --> 13:10.825
This is the gallery?
Yeah.

13:10.993 --> 13:14.229
This is a sandwich shop.

13:14.363 --> 13:16.398
Or it's a gallery after 8:00
'cause they make people put

13:16.499 --> 13:17.966
their laptops away.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.835
You have been busting
my balls all day

13:20.936 --> 13:23.338
over a sandwich shop?

13:23.406 --> 13:24.672
You know what, dude?

13:24.774 --> 13:27.976
I think I want you to stay out
here, 'cause I definitely don't

13:28.077 --> 13:30.178
want you coming in there if
you're not gonna be supportive.

13:30.279 --> 13:33.581
Oh, I will absolutely
be coming in.

13:33.682 --> 13:34.883
Oh, Jesus.

13:34.984 --> 13:36.418
You know what?
Fine.

13:36.552 --> 13:39.187
I'll just park myself out here
while you do your thing

13:39.321 --> 13:40.455
and you know what?

13:40.589 --> 13:42.490
In the meantime, I can just
watch your bag and make sure

13:42.591 --> 13:44.092
nobody touches it.
Fine, thank you.

13:44.226 --> 13:46.327
Yeah, you're welcome.
I appreciate it.

13:46.429 --> 13:47.429
Anytime!
God.

13:48.899 --> 13:50.766
♪ My eyes cannot
see the pain ♪

13:50.901 --> 13:56.305
♪ I walk in the dark I cry

13:56.406 --> 13:58.574
I'm sorry,
can I help you?

13:58.675 --> 14:00.443
Oh, I'm one
of the artists.

14:00.577 --> 14:01.744
One of the
sandwich artists?

14:01.845 --> 14:04.447
No, I'm one of the--
the artist artists.

14:04.548 --> 14:06.782
Have any of the pieces
sold yet?

14:06.917 --> 14:09.852
I know it's early.
I haven't heard anything.

14:09.953 --> 14:12.121
But I highly doubt it.

14:12.222 --> 14:14.657
Well, no, it's just that people
don't really come in here

14:14.791 --> 14:16.258
for the art.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.626
We're a sandwich shop.

14:17.761 --> 14:20.563
So we sell food.

14:20.697 --> 14:22.098
Would you like some?

14:22.265 --> 14:23.933
Are they...
free sandwiches?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.836
You can order
and then pay.

14:26.937 --> 14:29.338
Okay, so how it
usually works.

14:29.439 --> 14:30.539
It's-- Yeah.

14:30.640 --> 14:33.576
High-quality lotion,
I'm gonna take the lotion.

14:33.677 --> 14:35.311
God.

14:35.379 --> 14:37.413
(scoffs)
Gallery.

14:37.514 --> 14:38.681
Step into reality.

14:56.767 --> 14:59.435
Oh.

14:59.536 --> 15:01.904
Ilana?

15:02.072 --> 15:04.807
Are you eating
garbage bagels?

15:04.875 --> 15:05.975
Why are you here?

15:06.109 --> 15:09.779
Abbi sent me a Facebook invite
to her gallery debut.

15:09.880 --> 15:13.582
Do you...
look... crazy?

15:13.717 --> 15:16.185
Mm-hmm.

15:16.286 --> 15:18.287
Yeah, I do.

15:18.388 --> 15:20.723
I got locked out
and then I--

15:20.857 --> 15:24.660
I just, like, ruined
her night completely.

15:24.795 --> 15:27.363
I'm an idiot,
I'm like a dumb ass.

15:27.497 --> 15:28.864
I, like, can't function.

15:28.999 --> 15:30.466
Oh, don't be so hard
on yourself.

15:30.567 --> 15:31.834
Nobody's perfect.

15:31.935 --> 15:33.536
I'm not
a perfect dentist.

15:33.670 --> 15:34.737
I eat candy all the time.

15:34.871 --> 15:36.972
I got, like,
six cavities.

15:37.107 --> 15:38.707
Thanks-- thanks for--
Ahh!

15:38.842 --> 15:39.975
Ooh, what?

15:40.076 --> 15:41.043
Oh.

15:41.144 --> 15:44.647
Oh, my God.

15:44.748 --> 15:46.682
Oh, my God.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.684
The keys to
my apartment.

15:48.785 --> 15:50.453
Don't you ever
tell Abbi.

15:50.587 --> 15:51.754
You can't ever tell her.

15:51.888 --> 15:53.122
You can't ever tell her this,
this is--

15:53.223 --> 15:57.860
I won't tell Abbi, but I've
told you several times

15:57.994 --> 15:58.894
and I'll
tell you again,

15:59.062 --> 16:00.529
phone, keys, wallet--
Every time.

16:00.597 --> 16:02.665
Phone, keys,
wallet, P-K-W.

16:02.799 --> 16:06.936
Your brain is a muscle, Ilana,
and I feel like that muscle

16:07.103 --> 16:08.971
isn't getting
enough exercise.

16:09.105 --> 16:10.573
You need to do your
brain kegels.

16:15.846 --> 16:17.246
And five.

16:17.347 --> 16:18.714
Crushed it.

16:22.752 --> 16:25.688
That's my--
my drawing up there.

16:25.822 --> 16:28.491
You're in
a good spot for it.

16:28.592 --> 16:30.659
I'll take the hamburger.

16:30.794 --> 16:33.028
Oh, that's actually
not a menu item.

16:33.096 --> 16:34.363
It's art.

16:34.498 --> 16:36.198
We're actually a vegan
sandwich place.

16:36.333 --> 16:38.300
I mean, I guess it's,
like, ironic or something.

16:42.372 --> 16:43.305
Abbi's right.

16:43.406 --> 16:46.008
I'm not gonna make my room
a walk-in closet.

16:46.109 --> 16:48.577
I was always
anti- that idea.

16:48.712 --> 16:50.746
Who would want to live
in a closet?

16:50.847 --> 16:52.214
Oh, my God.

16:52.315 --> 16:55.618
Because then I would
be closeted.

16:55.719 --> 16:58.754
I was thinking more like who
would want to live amongst

16:58.855 --> 17:03.859
their clothes,
but also what you said.

17:03.994 --> 17:06.428
Either one.
Let's just go in here.

17:06.530 --> 17:08.830
Okay, yeah.

17:08.964 --> 17:11.634
Is that lotion?
Yeah.

17:11.734 --> 17:15.404
God, these bagels here are,
like, very good, so.

17:20.175 --> 17:21.844
How's the, um,
gallery going?

17:21.978 --> 17:23.244
It's not a gallery.

17:23.313 --> 17:25.347
It's a sandwich shop,
you were right.

17:25.482 --> 17:26.648
And they don't really--

17:26.782 --> 17:29.184
They don't even have meat,
so I don't know if I would even

17:29.286 --> 17:32.288
consider it
a sandwich shop,

17:32.389 --> 17:34.957
but... I'm sorry
I was a bitch.

17:35.058 --> 17:37.560
Don't even worry about it,
you know?

17:37.694 --> 17:38.994
When a friend
makes a mistake,

17:39.062 --> 17:40.262
you forgive them
blindly, right?

17:40.397 --> 17:41.463
Cool, yeah.

17:41.531 --> 17:44.733
I'm gonna go take a dump.
Oh... cool, cool.

17:44.801 --> 17:47.002
Hey Abbi, you gotta
start somewhere.

17:47.137 --> 17:48.504
And look at the Hardy boys.

17:48.638 --> 17:51.273
They started out as
kid detectives,

17:51.374 --> 17:53.676
just solving
mysteries in Bayport

17:53.810 --> 17:57.179
and now they have an entire
book series about them.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.381
Yeah, definitely, but you know,
they are, like,

17:59.516 --> 18:03.485
fictional characters,
but I appreciate the...

18:03.620 --> 18:04.787
sentiment behind it.

18:04.888 --> 18:07.222
Thanks for coming, Lincoln.
Thanks for inviting me.

18:07.357 --> 18:09.658
They wouldn't accept me
in the bathroom,

18:09.759 --> 18:11.594
so I'll just go
at your place.

18:11.728 --> 18:14.096
We're staying over, by the way.
Sleepover! Yes.

18:14.230 --> 18:15.698
I need this day to end.

18:15.765 --> 18:17.399
Hey, your drawing sold.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.902
Oh, my gosh!

18:20.003 --> 18:22.271
I think I'm gonna solstice--
I mean, focus on my art.

18:22.372 --> 18:24.139
So you have two options.

18:24.307 --> 18:27.876
You can take your cut of the
proceeds, which are 17.50,

18:28.044 --> 18:31.580
or you can get a credit
for, like, three sandwiches.

18:31.715 --> 18:33.549
17.50.
Yeah.

18:33.683 --> 18:34.683
Okay.

18:34.784 --> 18:36.952
And there's no meat.
No.

18:37.087 --> 18:38.887
Okay, how big are
the sandwiches?

18:38.989 --> 18:40.389
Like, substantial?

18:40.557 --> 18:41.557
We-- Sometimes.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.425
That's not--
That's not like a sandwich.

18:43.560 --> 18:45.561
That's a teeny
sandwich, right?

18:45.695 --> 18:46.862
People are full on that.

18:46.997 --> 18:48.464
Okay, well, I'm not
normal people.

18:48.531 --> 18:49.665
Okay.
I don't--

18:49.766 --> 18:52.267
Tofu is in them.
Is it thick?

18:52.402 --> 18:54.103
I don't know the degree
of tofu-ness.

18:54.204 --> 18:55.104
You have
no idea the degree.

18:55.205 --> 18:56.839
There should be some
sort of scale.

18:56.940 --> 19:00.142
Okay, to-go coffee mugs,
you guys must have that.

19:00.276 --> 19:02.277
Do you know what
a sandwich is?

19:02.345 --> 19:03.379
Do you?

19:03.546 --> 19:06.715
'Cause you don't have
any meat in them.

19:06.783 --> 19:08.183
There's no meat
in the sandwiches.

19:08.251 --> 19:11.453
Just an FYI, that makes the sandwich.
That's funny.

19:11.588 --> 19:12.621
Do you guys have
Naked juices?

19:16.559 --> 19:17.660
Hello.

19:17.761 --> 19:19.461
Oh, so you bought
the drawing.

19:19.529 --> 19:20.796
Two of my
favorite things.

19:20.964 --> 19:21.897
Art and Abbi?

19:21.998 --> 19:23.799
Um, hamburgers and Abbi.
Oh.

19:37.147 --> 19:38.280
Okay, I just--

19:38.381 --> 19:40.716
I kind of want
to hold it.

19:40.817 --> 19:42.317
All right.

19:50.293 --> 19:54.129
(whistling)

19:59.202 --> 20:02.638
(man)
Yolanda.

20:04.974 --> 20:07.443
Yolanda.

20:07.610 --> 20:10.746
I wanna pick
your little keyhole...

20:12.315 --> 20:14.183
Ahh!

20:14.317 --> 20:17.352
Yolanda!

20:17.487 --> 20:19.354
No!

20:19.456 --> 20:21.724
Yolanda!

20:21.858 --> 20:23.125
Why?

20:23.226 --> 20:24.993
Why?

20:27.664 --> 20:30.466
It's just a keyhole!

20:34.738 --> 20:36.638
Why?

20:36.773 --> 20:40.909
Why?

20:41.010 --> 20:45.848
(man screaming)

20:46.305 --> 20:52.588
