00:01.668 --> 00:04.004
Tonight, "Shark
Tank" brings the holiday cheer.

00:04.004 --> 00:06.707
Well, the fabric,
it's 6% spandex.

00:06.707 --> 00:09.209
The whole thing looks dated
and not that attractive.

00:09.209 --> 00:11.879
What did you think was going
to happen in "Shark Tank"?

00:11.879 --> 00:13.380
Not so festive.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.848
Ho! Ho! Ho!

00:14.848 --> 00:16.717
It's really hard to learn!

00:16.717 --> 00:19.253
This isn't ready yet.
We don't know what we're
doing.

00:19.253 --> 00:22.789
This is a toy that's going to
be in every house in America.

00:24.057 --> 00:26.693
Mr. Wonderful,
you have such a huge heart.

00:26.693 --> 00:27.694
- Aww.
- So true.

00:27.694 --> 00:29.096
Oh, my Lord.

00:37.170 --> 00:39.640
First in the Tank
is a convenient way

00:39.640 --> 00:42.276
to get festive
for the holidays.

00:49.416 --> 00:50.951
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Liz.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.019
And I'm Kristina.

00:52.019 --> 00:54.121
We're from San Francisco, California,

00:54.121 --> 00:56.890
and we're seeking
$250,000

00:56.890 --> 00:59.927
for a 10% equity stake
in our company... Wow.

00:59.927 --> 01:02.429
...ReadyFestive.

01:02.429 --> 01:05.599
Sharks, we all love the
feeling of a festive home

01:05.599 --> 01:08.402
for the many holidays
and seasons throughout the year.

01:08.402 --> 01:11.171
We love the magic,
the memories,

01:11.171 --> 01:14.708
the traditions made
with family and friends.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.411
But shopping
for decorations?

01:17.411 --> 01:19.046
Not so festive.

01:19.046 --> 01:21.815
Finding holiday
and seasonal decorations

01:21.815 --> 01:23.517
for your home
and your style

01:23.517 --> 01:26.353
can be a frustrating
and overwhelming process.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.956
Many of us lack the time
or the creativity

01:28.956 --> 01:30.657
to pull it
all together.

01:30.657 --> 01:32.359
And as soon
as one holiday's over,

01:32.359 --> 01:34.328
the next one
is around the corner.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.730
We need some help!

01:36.730 --> 01:39.032
Introducing
ReadyFestive.

01:39.032 --> 01:42.169
ReadyFestive is a customizable
and convenient service

01:42.169 --> 01:44.004
delivering on-trend
home decor

01:44.004 --> 01:46.506
for the holidays
and seasons you celebrate

01:46.506 --> 01:48.041
throughout the year.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.376
Here's how it works--

01:49.376 --> 01:51.278
Go to our website
and choose your favorite

01:51.278 --> 01:52.679
holidays and seasons.

01:52.679 --> 01:56.049
Select a mini, standard,
or deluxe box size.

01:56.049 --> 01:58.118
Next, customize your decor,

01:58.118 --> 02:00.354
and your ReadyFestive box
will be delivered

02:00.354 --> 02:01.622
right to your doorstep

02:01.622 --> 02:04.925
to help take your home
from everyday to holiday.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.627
No more
frenzied shopping trips

02:06.627 --> 02:08.795
or hours of scrolling required.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.064
Simply unbox
and start decorating,

02:11.064 --> 02:12.733
or as we like
to say...

02:12.733 --> 02:15.068
Stress less
and festive more.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.304
Sharks,
who's ready to flip

02:17.304 --> 02:20.173
this $25 billion industry
on its head

02:20.173 --> 02:21.375
and deliver festive

02:21.375 --> 02:23.510
to every doorstep
in America...

02:23.510 --> 02:24.745
With us?

02:24.745 --> 02:26.780
Wow. What do we have
in front of us?

02:26.780 --> 02:28.682
So, each of you has
a ReadyFestive box

02:28.682 --> 02:30.417
in front of you
to enjoy.

02:30.417 --> 02:33.654
Mark, we've curated
a Hanukkah box for you today.
Thank you.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.189
Barbara, we know that you love
to host Thanksgiving,

02:36.189 --> 02:39.059
so we have chosen
that box for you.
I do. I do.

02:39.059 --> 02:41.294
Mr. Wonderful,
America's sweetheart,

02:41.294 --> 02:43.397
we've chosen
a Valentine's Day box for you

02:43.397 --> 02:45.265
since you have such
a huge heart.

02:45.265 --> 02:46.366
- Aww.
- So true.

02:46.366 --> 02:47.567
Oh, my Lord.
You got confused.

02:47.567 --> 02:48.568
What does Lori have?

02:48.568 --> 02:49.870
Lori, we've curated

02:49.870 --> 02:52.072
a glam Halloween box
just for you.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.840
I love Halloween. Thank you. Wow.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.008
These are bunnies!

02:55.008 --> 02:56.576
We know you have
two cute bunnies at home

02:56.576 --> 02:58.045
that love
to decorate for Easter,

02:58.045 --> 02:59.446
so you have
an Easter box today.

02:59.446 --> 03:00.714
Oh, thank you.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.516
So, the products
in front of you

03:02.516 --> 03:05.719
are really representative of
the breadth of products

03:05.719 --> 03:07.721
that we provide
in all of our boxes.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.156
What's this?

03:09.156 --> 03:10.991
It's a table runner.
It's a runner.

03:10.991 --> 03:12.325
Oh.

03:12.325 --> 03:13.627
What's a table runner?

03:13.627 --> 03:14.861
It's a table runner.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.064
So, you lay it across
your dining room table,

03:17.064 --> 03:19.099
and then you can put
decorations or candles--

03:19.099 --> 03:21.101
Oh.
Why do they call it a runner?

03:21.101 --> 03:22.569
'Cause it runs down
the middle of the table.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.137
And why would
you even do that?

03:24.137 --> 03:26.006
Why don't you just
put it on the table?

03:26.006 --> 03:27.207
To make it
more festive.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.811
Do you get to choose
what you want in your box,

03:30.811 --> 03:33.613
and do you price it per box
or per item?

03:33.613 --> 03:34.881
So, we allow our customers

03:34.881 --> 03:36.783
to customize
in four different ways--

03:36.783 --> 03:38.719
choosing their holidays
and seasons.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.787
So, we have 14 options.

03:40.787 --> 03:43.423
Wow.
4 seasons
and 10 holidays.

03:43.423 --> 03:45.025
And we just require
that you sign up

03:45.025 --> 03:46.560
for a minimum
of three.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.828
We have two
payment options.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.696
You actually
can pay up front

03:49.696 --> 03:51.698
and save 10%
or pay as you go,

03:51.698 --> 03:53.366
which means you pay
as your box ships.

03:53.366 --> 03:56.203
You're trying to entice me
into a subscription service?

03:56.203 --> 03:58.505
It is, isn't it?
Yes. Yes.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.674
To our customer,
we're a subscription service,

04:00.674 --> 04:02.242
but, really,
we see ourselves

04:02.242 --> 04:03.677
as the new wave
of subscription

04:03.677 --> 04:05.812
because our service
is completely customizable

04:05.812 --> 04:06.913
for our customer.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.216
We're not a monthly
or a quarterly box

04:09.216 --> 04:10.784
because that's not how
you celebrate

04:10.784 --> 04:12.385
the holidays
and seasons.

04:12.385 --> 04:16.423
How do you keep track, then,
and have so much inventory?

04:16.423 --> 04:18.358
Because if I'm getting to pick
from everything,

04:18.358 --> 04:19.659
you have to pick and pack
each thing.

04:19.659 --> 04:21.194
Yeah.
Right?

04:21.194 --> 04:22.195
The beauty
of our business

04:22.195 --> 04:23.663
is that
it is customizable,

04:23.663 --> 04:25.932
and so our customers
are pre-ordering

04:25.932 --> 04:27.601
and we have
a lot of data

04:27.601 --> 04:30.003
that they feel comfortable
trusting us with. Yeah.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.706
And so with that data
and constantly talking to them

04:32.706 --> 04:34.541
and serving them,
and the pre-orders,

04:34.541 --> 04:36.676
we're able to forecast
very closely.

04:36.676 --> 04:39.746
And we've actually scoured
the trade shows every season

04:39.746 --> 04:41.782
and we find
the biggest trends,

04:41.782 --> 04:44.050
the biggest ideas,
and we curate

04:44.050 --> 04:46.219
usually three to four collections

04:46.219 --> 04:47.621
each holiday or season.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.590
And, Kristina, are you trying
to hit a certain price point

04:50.590 --> 04:52.259
in that collection
each and every time?

04:52.259 --> 04:53.260
We are, Barbara.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.896
So, our mini box is $69,

04:55.896 --> 04:57.664
our standard is $99,

04:57.664 --> 05:00.167
and our deluxe
is $159 plus shipping.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.868
And, really, what we promise
our customer

05:01.868 --> 05:03.303
is that the total
retail value

05:03.303 --> 05:04.805
of the items in your box

05:04.805 --> 05:06.506
will be equal to,
if not greater than,

05:06.506 --> 05:08.341
if you were to go out
and shop for them yourself.

05:08.341 --> 05:10.110
And then, of course,
we've saved you the time

05:10.110 --> 05:11.411
and the hassle
of doing that.

05:11.411 --> 05:15.015
Kristina, this seems like
a very complicated business.

05:15.015 --> 05:18.084
Potentially inventory,
potentially moving pieces.

05:18.084 --> 05:21.955
What makes you guys
qualified and experienced

05:21.955 --> 05:24.724
to run this business?

05:24.724 --> 05:26.726
So, Kristina and I
like to say

05:26.726 --> 05:29.129
that we have very
complementary business backgrounds.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.463
I bring the customer
in the door,

05:30.463 --> 05:32.132
and she gets them
out the door.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.167
Great. That's great.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.536
My background is primarily
in marketing and sales.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.171
I spent most of
my corporate career

05:38.171 --> 05:39.906
working for
one of the world's largest

05:39.906 --> 05:41.441
media and entertainment companies.

05:41.441 --> 05:43.276
And so, I really
handle everything

05:43.276 --> 05:44.578
that's customer-facing,

05:44.578 --> 05:46.313
all of our marketing
and social media.

05:46.313 --> 05:48.915
And my background
is in merchandising

05:48.915 --> 05:50.016
and product development.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.886
And I worked
for over 15 years

05:52.886 --> 05:54.921
at one of the world's
largest retailers.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.223
Okay, who?

05:56.223 --> 05:57.390
Gap Inc.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.326
So, guys, now would be
the appropriate time

05:59.326 --> 06:00.327
to talk about sales.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.261
Sales!
Yes.

06:01.261 --> 06:02.562
- Exactly.
- Yay!

06:02.562 --> 06:03.763
We were waiting
for you to ask.

06:03.763 --> 06:05.031
Well, I just did.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.801
So, we launched ReadyFestive
at the very end of 2019,

06:07.801 --> 06:09.402
so we're going on
our third year in business,

06:09.402 --> 06:11.805
and we've done
over $1.5 million in sales

06:11.805 --> 06:13.039
lifetime to date.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.407
Good for you.
Wow. Good job.

06:14.407 --> 06:15.609
Can you walk us through...
Now tell us each year.

06:15.609 --> 06:16.977
...year one,
year two, year three?

06:16.977 --> 06:20.413
So, year one,
we did $250,000 in sales.

06:20.413 --> 06:23.183
Year two, we doubled that
and did $500,000 in sales.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.285
And then this year,
we're tripling that, obviously,

06:25.285 --> 06:27.888
with $1.6 million
in sales for 2022.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.623
And are you
making money?
And what's your
year to date?

06:29.623 --> 06:30.657
This is the first year

06:30.657 --> 06:32.125
that we're going
to turn a profit.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.326
Good for you.
How much
are you going to make?

06:33.326 --> 06:34.761
We're going to make
$300,000 this year.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.830
Oh, congratulations.
And that's after
paying yourselves?

06:36.830 --> 06:37.898
We don't
pay ourselves, no.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.733
And what's your sales
year to date?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.902
Our sales year to date,
$800,000.

06:41.902 --> 06:42.936
That's good.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.237
What does it cost you
to make it,

06:44.237 --> 06:45.906
and what do you sell it for?

06:45.906 --> 06:49.042
Our average box
sells for $127

06:49.042 --> 06:51.745
and costs us
$75 to make.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.714
So it's a 40% margin
landed to the customer.

06:54.714 --> 06:57.751
So you must know
your customer acquisition cost.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.153
Our customer acquisition cost
is $40.

07:00.153 --> 07:03.556
Oof.
So, the average customer
comes to us and gets

07:03.556 --> 07:05.592
six-and-a-half boxes
during their tenure.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.128
They spend about
$750 with us.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.063
Our monthly churn
is about 5%.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.498
So that would lead to...
Oh, that's good.

07:11.498 --> 07:13.233
...our average customer stays
with us for about two years.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.434
So, another way
to look at that

07:14.434 --> 07:16.469
is how much is your prepaid
revenue right now?

07:16.469 --> 07:20.273
So what we have committed is
$800,000 in the door.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.109
And then we already
know, for 2023,

07:23.109 --> 07:24.945
that we have
close to $1.5 million.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.913
But you haven't collected
the cash.

07:26.913 --> 07:27.981
Some we have.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.083
85% pay
as your box ships.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.451
- Oh, I see.
- Okay, so only 15%.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.919
'Cause that's
an amazing float.

07:32.919 --> 07:35.188
If you could get
to a float of $800,000

07:35.188 --> 07:37.390
or $1 million up front,
that would be incredible.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.592
Boy, you guys
really know your numbers.
Guys, let me get
the ball started.

07:39.592 --> 07:41.394
Thank you.
You guys have built
a great business, right?

07:41.394 --> 07:43.463
Thank you.
And it's super cash friendly.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.232
And I can see you growing to
be, you know, $10 million in sales.

07:46.232 --> 07:49.235
But that's just not a business
that gets me excited.

07:49.235 --> 07:52.105
This is not my thing.
So for those reasons, I'm out.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.340
Thank you, Mark.
But congrats.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.441
You've built
an amazing business.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.242
Thank you.
Listen, ladies.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.478
The part of the business
that I'm uncomfortable with

07:58.478 --> 08:00.380
is how many holidays you have

08:00.380 --> 08:02.549
and how many SKUs
you have to keep stocked.

08:02.549 --> 08:05.352
And how you're cash-buying
all that product

08:05.352 --> 08:07.487
has to be anticipated well.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.389
It's too many SKUs,
so I'm out.

08:09.389 --> 08:10.757
Thank you, Barbara.
Thank you, Barbara.

08:10.757 --> 08:12.525
O'Leary: Ladies, I'm not sure
it's worth $2.5 million.

08:12.525 --> 08:16.363
And I was thinking, "Do I
beat them to a pulp on valuation

08:16.363 --> 08:18.798
even though I've got a little
love sign in front of me?"

08:18.798 --> 08:19.866
Aww.

08:19.866 --> 08:21.768
You know,
it's one of those deals

08:21.768 --> 08:24.204
where it's too small
right now.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.206
It's not for me.
I'm out.

08:29.342 --> 08:32.379
So, I don't really think
that you need a Shark.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.546
I don't always say that.

08:33.546 --> 08:36.082
When I feel it, though,
I say it honestly.

08:36.082 --> 08:39.285
Love what you're doing,
but, unfortunately, I'm out.

08:39.285 --> 08:42.856
Thank you, Lori.
Well, I don't agree
with that.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.959
Because you've made me
an amazing decorator.

08:47.494 --> 08:51.564
Look, you've created a
different push model to your customers,

08:51.564 --> 08:53.733
which is really fabulous.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.535
I love the holiday model.

08:55.535 --> 08:59.339
And what I've learned--
Tipsy Elves.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.774
We started out with
inappropriate, ugly

09:00.774 --> 09:03.343
Christmas sweaters.
Now we do every season.

09:03.343 --> 09:06.079
The key to it
is great operators.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.647
There's inventory challenges,

09:07.647 --> 09:10.617
there's stocking challenges,
there's design challenges.

09:10.617 --> 09:14.621
You need fantastic operators
who live and breathe

09:14.621 --> 09:17.490
the business all day long.

09:17.490 --> 09:20.593
You guys are great operators.

09:20.593 --> 09:21.928
Thanks, Robert.
Thanks, Robert.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.530
Like, you make me believe

09:23.530 --> 09:24.831
you're going to make
this business happen.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.132
Thank you.

09:26.132 --> 09:27.467
I'm going
to make you an offer.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.545
Four Sharks are out.

09:38.545 --> 09:42.248
Robert is Kristina and Liz's
last chance for a deal

09:42.248 --> 09:47.087
for their holiday decoration
business, ReadyFestive.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.090
You guys are great operators.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.458
Thanks, Robert.
Thanks, Robert.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.059
Like, you make me believe

09:53.059 --> 09:54.427
you're going to make
this business happen.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.762
Thank you.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.331
I'm going
to make you an offer.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.033
I love the holiday season,

10:00.033 --> 10:02.235
and I think it's a bet
on you guys.

10:02.235 --> 10:06.005
I will give you
the $250,000 for 20%.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.175
20%?
Yeah.

10:10.677 --> 10:11.678
Thank you, Robert.

10:11.678 --> 10:14.047
Thank you
for that offer.

10:14.047 --> 10:17.383
At 20%,
that's going to value us

10:17.383 --> 10:20.420
below what we'll do
in sales for this year.

10:20.420 --> 10:23.256
So, we'd like to...
Good for you. Good for you.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.358
...counter you. Okay.

10:25.358 --> 10:29.529
Would you do
the $250,000 for 12%?

10:31.998 --> 10:34.467
12% just isn't enough
for me, Liz.

10:34.467 --> 10:38.371
I mean, yeah, it may
value you below the revenue,

10:38.371 --> 10:42.775
but I think it's more of what
we can do with the money today

10:42.775 --> 10:44.144
and where we're going.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.547
I built a $500 million
business with a line of credit,

10:47.547 --> 10:52.418
so I'm very good at making
sure the money is being used wisely.

10:52.418 --> 10:56.122
But I love you so much,
I'll come down a little bit.

10:56.122 --> 10:57.123
Okay.

10:57.123 --> 10:59.826
You went up 2%.
I'll go to 18%.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.296
Let's go
and decorate Christmas.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.531
O'Leary: Ladies,
remember the love.

11:04.531 --> 11:05.899
Let's bring joy to the world.

11:05.899 --> 11:09.469
Remember the love.

11:09.469 --> 11:12.071
Thank you, Robert.

11:12.071 --> 11:13.973
Okay,
one more counter-offer.

11:13.973 --> 11:16.876
Okay.
How about 15%?

11:16.876 --> 11:18.378
18.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.879
How about 15?
18.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.681
Based on our forward-looking
run rate... 18.

11:21.681 --> 11:25.051
...we're gonna do $2.5 million
in the next 12 months.

11:25.051 --> 11:26.686
That feels very fair.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.655
It is, but this is
the Shark Tank.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.890
And you're not going--
Can you do $300,000
for 18%?

11:30.890 --> 11:32.926
I'll do $250,000 for 18%.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.428
Look, a year from now,

11:35.428 --> 11:37.197
you're not going to look back
and remember the 3%.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.502
Alright, Robert.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.503
You've got a deal!
You've got a deal!

11:43.503 --> 11:44.704
Whoo!

11:44.704 --> 11:46.439
Thank you, Robert.
We're glad to have you.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.440
So excited!

11:47.440 --> 11:48.708
You're even
in Easter pastels.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.911
I stepped on you.
No, that's okay.

11:51.911 --> 11:53.613
Wow!
This is awesome.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.548
Thank you so much!
Yay! Thank you, everyone.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.283
Congratulations, guys.

11:57.283 --> 11:58.885
Whoo!

11:58.885 --> 11:59.886
Yeah!

11:59.886 --> 12:01.354
We gave away more equity

12:01.354 --> 12:02.789
than we were looking for,

12:02.789 --> 12:04.958
but Robert is going to be
a great partner.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.192
He has Tipsy Elves.

12:06.192 --> 12:08.361
He gets the holidays,
he gets us,

12:08.361 --> 12:10.897
and we know that we are going
to do great things with him.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.467
In Season 11,
we saw Daniel Zakowski,

12:14.467 --> 12:16.002
Dr. Katie Marks-Cogan,

12:16.002 --> 12:18.504
and Dr. Andy Leitner
make a deal with Mark Cuban

12:18.504 --> 12:21.007
for their food allergy
introduction kit for babies,

12:21.007 --> 12:22.041
Ready, Set, Food!

12:22.041 --> 12:24.310
Feeding allergenic foods
to babies

12:24.310 --> 12:26.246
can help prevent
food allergies.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.081
Let's see
what they're up to now.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.215
When we pitched
to the Sharks,

12:29.215 --> 12:31.117
we had no retail
distribution at all,

12:31.117 --> 12:32.118
and about
half a million dollars

12:32.118 --> 12:33.386
of lifetime sales.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.988
In the last two-and-a-half
years since "Shark Tank,"

12:34.988 --> 12:36.155
everything has changed.

12:36.155 --> 12:37.390
We've launched
in large retailers

12:37.390 --> 12:38.825
like Target and Walmart,

12:38.825 --> 12:41.594
and we've sold over $6 million
worth of product.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.695
Today we're doing
a photoshoot

12:42.695 --> 12:44.130
for the exciting,
new holiday flavor

12:44.130 --> 12:45.798
of baby oatmeal,
pumpkin cinnamon.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.133
It's delicious.
Babies love it.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.102
It's just an exciting way
to celebrate the holiday,

12:49.102 --> 12:50.770
announce the launch,
and also to build awareness

12:50.770 --> 12:52.205
for early
allergen introduction.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.574
We've seen growth
in all areas of the company,

12:54.574 --> 12:57.176
starting from 8 employees
to now 27,

12:57.176 --> 12:59.112
including retail sales, science,

12:59.112 --> 13:00.480
research and development.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.282
Marks-Cogan: Our biggest issue
before "Shark Tank"

13:02.282 --> 13:04.050
was the ability
to spread awareness

13:04.050 --> 13:05.985
to the public
and the medical community

13:05.985 --> 13:07.954
about food allergies
and prevention.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.223
And now,
because of Mark's backing,

13:10.223 --> 13:12.625
we're able to get in front
of major health care systems

13:12.625 --> 13:15.161
so we can reach hundreds
of thousands of families

13:15.161 --> 13:16.162
every year.

13:16.162 --> 13:17.430
You know,
it's frustrating

13:17.430 --> 13:19.832
when you hear about children
that have food allergies

13:19.832 --> 13:21.167
when you know
it's preventable.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.069
And our biggest challenge is
getting the word out.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.538
And our goal is to reach
more than a million kids

13:25.538 --> 13:26.939
each and every year.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.741
You know,
it's an educational process,

13:28.741 --> 13:30.310
but we're going to hit
that million.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.613
And being able to protect
more than a million kids a
year?

13:33.613 --> 13:34.714
That's insane.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.382
Tell us what your
experience has been like

13:36.382 --> 13:39.719
as a parent with a child
of extreme food allergies.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.654
You know, as a parent
of a daughter

13:41.654 --> 13:45.224
with multiple peanut
allergies, it's terrifying.

13:45.224 --> 13:47.760
You know, one pistachio,
one cashew

13:47.760 --> 13:50.296
that someone puts in a recipe,
and it can be fatal.

13:50.296 --> 13:53.032
And what's more terrifying
than that to a parent?

13:53.032 --> 13:54.901
And so this really
hits home for me,

13:54.901 --> 13:57.236
and I'm proud to be
part of Ready, Set, Food!

13:57.236 --> 13:59.405
And I'm really excited that,
in the future,

13:59.405 --> 14:01.207
no other parent
will go through

14:01.207 --> 14:02.709
what we are going through

14:02.709 --> 14:04.310
and no other child
will go through

14:04.310 --> 14:05.545
what my daughter
is going through

14:05.545 --> 14:07.413
because of what
Ready, Set, Food! is doing.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.693
Next up
is what the entrepreneurs

14:20.693 --> 14:23.796
believe will be
the next big hit toy.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.035
Whoa.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.639
Hello, Sharks.

14:33.639 --> 14:35.174
I'm Austin Hillam.

14:35.174 --> 14:36.642
And I am Stephen Fazio.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.511
Throughout the decades,

14:38.511 --> 14:40.246
we have been
introduced to objects

14:40.246 --> 14:42.982
that have entertained
and engaged millions.

14:44.150 --> 14:47.387
Early on,
it was the yo-yo.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.723
In the '60s,
we had the Etch A Sketch.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.127
In the '80s,
there was the Rubik's Cube.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.129
Now introducing...

14:56.129 --> 14:58.965
The toy
of the future.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.836
ZipString!

15:07.006 --> 15:10.443
Anything the user does,
ZipString follows.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.746
The string flies around
35 miles per hour,

15:13.746 --> 15:15.882
and yet is safe
to the touch.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.850
Alright, Sharks,
watch this trick.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.585
It's called
"the swirl."

15:22.054 --> 15:24.023
This one's
"the corkscrew."

15:24.023 --> 15:27.693
This one's
"the step-through."

15:27.693 --> 15:29.829
And "the pop."

15:29.829 --> 15:31.864
Presenting...
"the portal."

15:32.999 --> 15:34.901
Whoo! Whoo!

15:34.901 --> 15:37.970
ZipString glides around
smooth objects.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.105
Ooh.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.574
All smooth objects.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.777
ZipString has taken
the world by storm.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.913
Oh, my God.
It's so cool.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.014
Wow!

15:48.014 --> 15:50.216
We are here
for a $100,000 investment

15:50.216 --> 15:52.452
for 10% of our business.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.920
Wow!
Sharks...

15:53.920 --> 15:55.888
Who's ready to Zip?

15:56.923 --> 15:58.090
Let's show you guys
how it works.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.092
And some of you
have already figured it out.

16:00.092 --> 16:01.627
So what you want to do
is you want to hold it

16:01.627 --> 16:02.962
upright like this
with the logo facing downwards.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.163
And get it into
the channel.

16:04.163 --> 16:05.898
- Oh, yeah!
- You got it? You got it?

16:05.898 --> 16:09.068
Yeah, there you go!
Whoo! Whoo!

16:09.068 --> 16:11.304
See how that
emulates your movements?

16:11.304 --> 16:12.305
Guys, come on.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.506
I love it!

16:13.506 --> 16:15.875
We love it, too.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.577
Did you invent it?
Yes, we sure did.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.645
Tell us the story,
how you came up with it.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.414
I'm super passionate
about electronics.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.884
Couple of years ago,
I watched a physics teacher

16:24.884 --> 16:27.787
demonstrate
a benchtop string launcher.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.489
He had this device

16:29.489 --> 16:31.724
that would launch a string
in a loop.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.759
And I took
that benchtop version,

16:33.759 --> 16:36.829
I compacted it,
made it handheld,

16:36.829 --> 16:39.131
and I made this prototype.

16:39.131 --> 16:40.533
Everybody loved it.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.269
But I knew I couldn't make
a scalable business out of it.

16:43.269 --> 16:45.204
Until I had Austin over.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.240
We were just
nerding out about this device.

16:47.240 --> 16:51.310
My father had some great
input, and we turned it into a toy.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.346
I put that toy
on my social media,

16:53.346 --> 16:57.016
and by the end of the day,
I had over 20 million views.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.384
No way. Wow.
What?!

16:58.384 --> 17:00.319
It hit
the front page of Reddit.

17:00.319 --> 17:01.921
Wow!
Oh, my gosh!

17:01.921 --> 17:03.589
It went
just absolutely nuts.

17:03.589 --> 17:04.690
When was that?

17:04.690 --> 17:05.491
We had everybody
reaching out to us.

17:05.491 --> 17:06.425
When was that?

17:06.425 --> 17:08.394
It was just
over a year ago.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.263
So how many of you sold
from all that?

17:10.263 --> 17:12.298
We sold over 10,000.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.500
That's it? And how much
do you charge for them?

17:14.500 --> 17:16.502
They start at $25.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.572
What?
Why, with 20 million views,
you only sold that little?

17:19.572 --> 17:22.074
What's it cost to make them?
It costs $6.35.

17:22.074 --> 17:23.242
So,
here's what happened.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.978
So, we did a Kickstarter,
ran that successfully.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.580
An all American
comedy group

17:27.580 --> 17:29.315
known as Dude Perfect
reached out.

17:29.315 --> 17:30.683
Yeah.
They loved it.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.919
They took it
on a nationwide stage tour,

17:32.919 --> 17:34.086
showed it around
the world.

17:34.086 --> 17:38.124
Today, ZipString
is in over 50 countries.

17:38.124 --> 17:40.326
We've had so much exposure.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.295
Over 200 million views
in total.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.397
Austin, after the
Kickstarter... Yeah?

17:44.397 --> 17:47.567
...20 million views,
national tour, all of that...

17:47.567 --> 17:49.635
Yeah.
...what were the total sales

17:49.635 --> 17:51.270
in dollars?
Yeah.

17:51.270 --> 17:53.873
$277,000.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.274
Why so little?
Disappointed.

17:55.274 --> 17:57.476
With all due respect... Absolutely.

17:57.476 --> 17:58.678
...if we didn't have
the 20 million views

17:58.678 --> 17:59.745
and all the other stuff...
Sure, sure, sure.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.080
...I'd say,
"Hey, great start."

18:01.080 --> 18:03.482
Why this and only this?

18:03.482 --> 18:04.584
Supply chain.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.252
We were struggling
to figure that out.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.688
The demand was there.
Preorders were coming.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.624
We couldn't make them
fast enough. We weren't ready.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.693
Have you solved your
supply chain problems?

18:13.693 --> 18:15.361
Supply chain
is all set up.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.263
Can you do an order
for 100,000 units?

18:17.263 --> 18:18.664
We can. As long as
we have the cash flow.

18:18.664 --> 18:20.466
How does that
reduce the price?

18:20.466 --> 18:22.401
Because right now you're
paying $6.35 to make them.

18:22.401 --> 18:24.770
I know we can get it down
to $5.87.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.973
$25 is too expensive.
I think so.

18:26.973 --> 18:29.208
What is the expense in this?
The battery?

18:29.208 --> 18:31.477
That's the largest expense.
That's correct. Yeah.

18:31.477 --> 18:33.446
Why? You think $25
for this is expensive?

18:33.446 --> 18:34.547
- I do.
- Too much.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.182
- Yeah, I do, too.
- For little kids, yeah.

18:36.182 --> 18:37.617
For parents to buy
for their little kids.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.986
$19.95,
it's five times the sales.
Are you kidding me?

18:39.986 --> 18:41.754
Have you guys not bought
a stuffed animal lately?

18:41.754 --> 18:43.155
Well,
if you could be $9.95,

18:43.155 --> 18:45.825
you would sell them like billions.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.059
And here's what's happened.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.828
They've talked and have
a verbal commitment

18:48.828 --> 18:51.497
with Walmart Canada
to start shipping

18:51.497 --> 18:52.531
and selling these.

18:52.531 --> 18:55.301
There,
it'll be $14.97.

18:55.301 --> 18:58.037
I'll make you an offer.
I'll take no equity whatsoever.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.373
If I've ever seen a royalty
deal, it's this one.

19:00.373 --> 19:03.009
I want a buck a unit,
and I'll give you the
$100,000.

19:03.009 --> 19:06.145
And watch what I can do
in blowing this thing up.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.247
There's only one
Mr. Wonderful.

19:08.247 --> 19:09.515
Kevin,
is that in perpetuity?

19:09.515 --> 19:11.384
Kevin, they don't
have that big a margin.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.085
What's perpetuity, Robert?
Here's--

19:13.085 --> 19:15.554
- Forever.
- Oh, yes, it is.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.256
Here's what
you're investing in.

19:17.256 --> 19:21.360
You're investing
in a new category of toys.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.562
Really, Austin,
I've heard this my whole life--

19:23.562 --> 19:25.131
new categories of everything.

19:25.131 --> 19:28.401
This is a new category.
We are the category kings.

19:28.401 --> 19:31.103
What do you think
of my offer?

19:31.103 --> 19:32.638
If there's no other offer,

19:32.638 --> 19:35.274
all of a sudden
I'm feeling even more wonderful.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.145
Let me jump in.
I mean, I love the innovation.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.446
Love you guys.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.915
I think it's early,
so I am taking myself out.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.216
I wish you good luck.

19:44.216 --> 19:46.952
It's nothing I could help
with, honestly.

19:46.952 --> 19:49.722
It's not for me.
I'm out.

19:49.722 --> 19:52.992
Alright, guys.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.560
Couldn't love it more.
Let's hear it.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.595
Couldn't love it more, seriously.

19:56.595 --> 19:59.832
The key for me
is you gotta keep going, right?

19:59.832 --> 20:01.534
You've got to be the cool... Exactly.

20:01.534 --> 20:06.205
...stringy, floaty,
scientist-y, geeky product.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.074
That's the investment
I want to make.

20:08.074 --> 20:09.742
That's the ride
I want to go on with you.

20:09.742 --> 20:10.810
Is there
an offer involved?

20:10.810 --> 20:16.082
Yeah. I will give you
$100,000 for 20%.

20:16.082 --> 20:19.585
I'll do $100,000
for 15%.

20:19.585 --> 20:22.822
I'll do $100,000 for 10%.

20:22.822 --> 20:27.626
Exactly what you offered
if you take the deal.

20:27.626 --> 20:31.030
I'll give you extra.
I'll do it for 9%.

20:37.503 --> 20:39.338
Can we take a second
to talk real quick?

20:39.338 --> 20:40.406
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.475
Guys, let me--
let me step in.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.510
What you guys have done
is great, right?

20:44.510 --> 20:47.213
It's creative. You got a
chance to make some money.

20:47.213 --> 20:50.750
But as an investment, I think
it peters out at some point.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.618
I don't really see it
as being investable.

20:52.618 --> 20:53.753
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.721
- Oh!
- Sure. Thank you, Mark.

20:55.721 --> 20:59.158
O'Leary: Robert,
just thinking here.

20:59.158 --> 21:02.061
You and me together
for 20%.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.562
For $100,000, right?

21:03.562 --> 21:05.297
I like it!
You know why?

21:05.297 --> 21:06.599
I like it, Kevin.
Because you double

21:06.599 --> 21:08.968
your social media following,
you get two Sharks,

21:08.968 --> 21:10.436
and we're
a little sharky.

21:10.436 --> 21:13.506
Together, instead of us
killing each other, we help you.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.241
- Double trouble.
- Double trouble.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.276
So, basically, we give you
$100,000 for 20%,

21:17.276 --> 21:18.444
you get two Sharks.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.812
Oh, I love that, Kevin.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.081
Guys, it's your chance--
$100,000 for 20%?

21:22.081 --> 21:24.183
$100,000, 20%,
two of us.

21:24.183 --> 21:27.086
Would you-- your
previous offers, are
those still available?

21:27.086 --> 21:28.053
Oh, he wants to hear
what you said before.

21:28.053 --> 21:29.188
Are those
still on the table?

21:29.188 --> 21:31.423
There is no rearview mirror
in my life.

21:31.423 --> 21:32.858
You gotta let it go.

21:32.858 --> 21:34.593
This is the deal
in front of you right now.

21:34.593 --> 21:35.861
What do
you want to do?

21:39.365 --> 21:41.901
Alright, we're
going to counter.

21:43.435 --> 21:45.337
The counter is,
would you be willing

21:45.337 --> 21:47.072
to go for 15%
together?

21:47.072 --> 21:48.707
No!
You know why?

21:48.707 --> 21:49.708
I want to get up
in the morning

21:49.708 --> 21:50.743
and feel I own
a piece of it.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.878
Come on,
we each own 10%.
Yeah.

21:52.878 --> 21:54.547
This is a toy
that's going to be

21:54.547 --> 21:55.981
in every house
in America.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.883
We agree, which is why
we made you the offer.

21:57.883 --> 21:58.951
You guys realize

21:58.951 --> 22:01.720
that you had
an offer before at 9%,

22:01.720 --> 22:02.788
but you didn't grab it.

22:02.788 --> 22:05.157
So now you're
sitting here at 20%.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.392
That happens
in the Shark Tank sometimes.

22:06.392 --> 22:07.393
Yes, it does, Lori.

22:07.393 --> 22:08.394
But you walk out
with a deal,

22:08.394 --> 22:09.395
you get two Sharks.

22:09.395 --> 22:11.096
That's extremely valuable.

22:11.096 --> 22:13.032
Alright.
Uh-oh.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.133
What's going on?

22:15.067 --> 22:17.570
Robert? Kevin?

22:18.537 --> 22:19.538
You got a deal.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.408
Let's get up here. Alright.

22:22.408 --> 22:23.676
Let's Zip around.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.277
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

22:25.277 --> 22:26.512
You were absolutely fantastic.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.580
We're very excited.
Thank you very much.

22:27.580 --> 22:28.581
This is the next...

22:31.250 --> 22:32.384
Let's build
a big business.

22:32.384 --> 22:33.485
Alright, Sharks.

22:33.485 --> 22:34.954
- Congratulations, guys.
- Good luck, guys.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.422
- Good luck.
- Take care, guys.

22:36.422 --> 22:40.092
What do you think, man?
Dude, two Sharks, 20%.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.628
You know, $100,000 and 9%
would have been the deal,

22:42.628 --> 22:44.830
and we probably should have
just grabbed it up.

22:44.830 --> 22:45.831
But, you know,
I don't think

22:45.831 --> 22:47.366
we lost at all
in the end.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.901
With two
Sharks joining,

22:48.901 --> 22:50.502
I think this is going to be
an exciting ride.

22:50.502 --> 22:51.604
Good day
in the Tank.

23:02.848 --> 23:04.116
Next into the Tank

23:04.116 --> 23:07.853
is a better way to learn
how to play a classic game.

23:15.828 --> 23:17.796
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Jeff Wigh.

23:17.796 --> 23:19.031
And I'm Adam Roush.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.199
We are two
of the founders

23:20.199 --> 23:22.835
of Bryght Labs,
the makers of ChessUp.

23:22.835 --> 23:25.170
We're here seeking
a $300,000 investment

23:25.170 --> 23:27.339
for a 5% equity share
in our company.

23:27.339 --> 23:28.340
Wow.

23:28.340 --> 23:30.943
Sharks, chess
is a brilliant game.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.344
It's great
for the mind,

23:32.344 --> 23:33.746
and it connects
millions of people

23:33.746 --> 23:35.180
all around the world,

23:35.180 --> 23:37.583
regardless
of age or culture.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.118
But chess has one

23:39.118 --> 23:40.586
king-sized
problem.

23:40.586 --> 23:43.122
It's really hard to learn!

23:43.122 --> 23:44.290
And once
you do learn,

23:44.290 --> 23:45.925
it's even harder
to improve,

23:45.925 --> 23:48.627
making chess
an intimidating game.

23:48.627 --> 23:49.628
Until now.

23:49.628 --> 23:50.729
ChessUp is chess

23:50.729 --> 23:52.364
like you've never
seen it before.

23:52.364 --> 23:54.166
It has
a built-in AI.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.734
It teaches you
how to play.

23:55.734 --> 23:57.169
New to chess?

23:57.169 --> 23:59.138
The magic is
at your fingertips.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.205
Simply touch a piece,

24:00.205 --> 24:02.408
and you're already
learning how to play.

24:02.408 --> 24:03.876
ChessUp features
a patented

24:03.876 --> 24:06.312
artificial intelligence
trainer that comes with

24:06.312 --> 24:08.347
six different levels
of assistance.

24:08.347 --> 24:10.449
Now, you really can
learn and improve

24:10.449 --> 24:11.617
while you play.

24:11.617 --> 24:12.851
It even
lets you play

24:12.851 --> 24:15.120
with a buddy who's
halfway around the world,

24:15.120 --> 24:16.989
with their moves
instantly lighting up

24:16.989 --> 24:18.924
right on the board
in front of you.

24:18.924 --> 24:20.759
For the first time ever,

24:20.759 --> 24:22.561
two players
of any skill level

24:22.561 --> 24:23.996
can have a balanced,

24:23.996 --> 24:26.999
competitive, and fun match
against each other.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.868
ChessUp is soaring
to success.

24:29.868 --> 24:30.936
But there's one piece

24:30.936 --> 24:32.471
that our chess set
is missing--

24:32.471 --> 24:33.472
a Shark.

24:34.573 --> 24:36.108
So who's ready
to make a move

24:36.108 --> 24:37.643
and capture
a whole lot of cash?

24:38.644 --> 24:40.412
Okay, Sharks,
you each have a ChessUp

24:40.412 --> 24:41.914
that's set up
and ready to play.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.315
Once you touch
a piece for white,

24:43.315 --> 24:44.817
the AI on your side
will show you

24:44.817 --> 24:47.052
all the available moves
ranked by strength.

24:47.052 --> 24:48.187
So green moves
are the best

24:48.187 --> 24:49.888
and red moves
are the worst.

24:49.888 --> 24:51.757
Then once you move
the white piece,

24:51.757 --> 24:53.025
the black side
is going to show you

24:53.025 --> 24:54.360
where it wants you
to move its piece,

24:54.360 --> 24:56.562
and you can continue
the game from there.

24:56.562 --> 24:57.830
But it
doesn't talk to you.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.331
Like, I'm making those moves,

24:59.331 --> 25:01.633
but I don't really understand
the logic behind it.

25:01.633 --> 25:03.102
There's a curated
set of lessons

25:03.102 --> 25:05.004
that we have
a professional chess teacher

25:05.004 --> 25:06.905
that actually walks you
through different scenarios

25:06.905 --> 25:08.173
and teaches you
different strategies.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.475
That's what comes with it.

25:09.475 --> 25:10.809
Not pertaining to this
particular game I'm playing?

25:10.809 --> 25:12.144
Not your exact game you're
playing right now, no.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.212
I got it.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.681
So, I'm curious,
how much does this cost,

25:15.681 --> 25:17.049
and what does it cost you
to make it?

25:17.049 --> 25:19.418
Full retail
is $399.

25:19.418 --> 25:21.653
We land it here
for $120.

25:21.653 --> 25:24.289
Okay, so, I've played chess
since I was 13,

25:24.289 --> 25:27.826
and I don't want to be told
what I've got to do.

25:27.826 --> 25:30.229
I want to play the AI.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.597
We can control
the level of assistance

25:31.597 --> 25:32.598
on either side.

25:32.598 --> 25:34.299
You can adjust
the settings on there

25:34.299 --> 25:35.267
to just see
the legal moves

25:35.267 --> 25:36.135
and you would receive
no assistance.

25:36.135 --> 25:37.302
Why is it so slow?

25:37.302 --> 25:39.038
Can I adjust the speed?

25:39.038 --> 25:40.639
Because I'm trying
to play it quickly.

25:40.639 --> 25:42.975
Let us show you a video,
actually, on this.

25:42.975 --> 25:45.010
The board can keep up
with every human movement.

25:45.010 --> 25:46.812
You can play bullet games,
blitz games,

25:46.812 --> 25:48.180
which are
very fast formats.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.681
You're going to see
that it's doing

25:49.681 --> 25:51.083
an automatic clock
where it's keeping track

25:51.083 --> 25:52.351
of your time
and your opponent's time.

25:52.351 --> 25:53.585
Wow. That's fast.

25:53.585 --> 25:54.887
That's cool.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.389
So, wait, there's a ton of
online chess platforms.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.657
Yes.
Right?

25:58.657 --> 26:00.559
There's a ton
of software apps. Absolutely.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.494
You know,
why would I spend $399,

26:02.494 --> 26:04.830
when a lot of them are free
or ad driven or whatever?

26:04.830 --> 26:05.998
Online chess
is incredible.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.566
We connect with
those platforms

26:07.566 --> 26:09.535
and you can play just
like you'd play online,

26:09.535 --> 26:10.936
but you're playing
on a real, physical board.

26:10.936 --> 26:12.905
So the real difference
is that you're playing

26:12.905 --> 26:15.841
on a physical board, so you
get the tactile feel. Yeah.

26:15.841 --> 26:17.209
And the learning element.
It's just
a preference.

26:17.209 --> 26:20.079
And what online misses
is that family experience.

26:20.079 --> 26:23.348
So are you doing this full
time or do you have a
different job?

26:23.348 --> 26:25.250
We are very much
full time.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.419
We met at
the innovation lab

26:27.419 --> 26:29.655
of a major consumer
electronics brand.

26:29.655 --> 26:30.656
Between
Jeff and myself,

26:30.656 --> 26:32.391
we're listed
on over 20 patents...

26:32.391 --> 26:34.593
Wow.
...and we're responsible
for a lifetime revenue

26:34.593 --> 26:36.295
of over $1 billion. Whoa.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.097
Can you name a product that
you brought to market

26:38.097 --> 26:39.231
that we would know?

26:39.231 --> 26:41.900
Sure. So I did,
most recently, Garmin Lily,

26:41.900 --> 26:43.135
which is a women's
smartwatch.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.269
It's really small
and it's--

26:44.269 --> 26:46.038
I wear the Garmin,
and I love it.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.473
Oh, that's fantastic.

26:47.473 --> 26:50.442
So, I took the job at Garmin
in an innovation lab

26:50.442 --> 26:52.744
in order to take a step
through entrepreneurship.

26:52.744 --> 26:54.346
No joke, when I
started that job,

26:54.346 --> 26:56.048
I had never been around
all the business terms,

26:56.048 --> 26:57.249
so I started watching
"Shark Tank."

26:58.217 --> 27:00.285
I'm up here
because of this show.

27:00.285 --> 27:02.588
Three years ago,
after a few hits,

27:02.588 --> 27:04.289
you know, watching these
hundreds of millions of dollars

27:04.289 --> 27:06.725
for our employer, and we were
just getting paid salaries,

27:06.725 --> 27:07.726
I decided to leave.

27:07.726 --> 27:08.794
I called up Adam first.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.196
We started prototyping
these gadgets,

27:11.196 --> 27:12.998
and the best
concept we had

27:12.998 --> 27:14.700
when we were working
was on this chess product.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.135
So we took it
to Kickstarter,

27:16.135 --> 27:17.903
and from there
we had enough revenue

27:17.903 --> 27:19.505
from Kickstarter
to start the company.

27:19.505 --> 27:20.873
Herjavec and Greiner: What did
you raise in your Kickstarter?

27:20.873 --> 27:22.307
We did $1.7 million

27:22.307 --> 27:23.308
in 39 days.
Whoa!

27:23.308 --> 27:24.309
- Whoa.
- Wow.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.511
What were
you looking to raise?

27:25.511 --> 27:27.613
We set the goal
at $30,000.

27:27.613 --> 27:28.647
That is crazy.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.082
And you
raised $1.7 million.

27:30.082 --> 27:32.818
But you're asking for
$300,000 for 5%.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.753
$6 million valuation.

27:34.753 --> 27:35.954
What are your sales?

27:35.954 --> 27:37.389
So, we told you about
the Kickstarter sales.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.724
That was $1.7 million.

27:38.724 --> 27:40.826
Since then, we have not
been running ads at all,

27:40.826 --> 27:43.095
but we've just had people
trickling to the website.

27:43.095 --> 27:45.063
We've sold $400,000
this year to date.

27:46.231 --> 27:48.467
Adam and Jeff, I want to get
the ball rolling.

27:48.467 --> 27:50.636
This is a business
I could do nothing for you.

27:50.636 --> 27:51.737
It's not my thing.

27:51.737 --> 27:53.238
I'm still on checkers
and struggling.

27:54.239 --> 27:55.407
I'm out.

27:56.375 --> 27:57.376
Thank you, Barbara.
So, guys...

27:57.376 --> 27:58.544
Thank you.

27:58.544 --> 28:00.779
...why am I limited
to the hardware platform?

28:00.779 --> 28:02.748
I love chess.
I'm going to travel.

28:02.748 --> 28:04.683
I'm always taking
my laptop with me.

28:04.683 --> 28:05.951
Now I'm going to take <i>this?</i>

28:05.951 --> 28:08.020
I'm going to take
another bag with me?

28:08.020 --> 28:10.122
There's 50 million
online chess players,

28:10.122 --> 28:11.857
and we're not arguing
that online chess

28:11.857 --> 28:13.125
doesn't have
its place.
50 million?

28:13.125 --> 28:14.459
Yeah, there's
600 million people

28:14.459 --> 28:15.627
who play over
a real board.

28:15.627 --> 28:17.629
Over a real board?
Yes.

28:17.629 --> 28:21.400
I was gonna say, there's
something about chess pieces
and doing it physically.

28:21.400 --> 28:25.871
It is.
I mean, to me, playing chess
on a tablet feels terrible.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.706
Yeah.
See, I have no problem
with the tablet, guys.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.274
I like chess.
I don't love it, right?

28:29.274 --> 28:30.943
I'll play it when my son
wants to play it.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.311
To me, it doesn't matter
if it's a board.

28:32.311 --> 28:33.979
And actually,
it's better when it's online

28:33.979 --> 28:35.747
because I can be wherever.

28:35.747 --> 28:37.583
I just don't see it
as a big enough market for me.

28:37.583 --> 28:39.084
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

28:40.085 --> 28:41.920
And what will sales be
this year?

28:41.920 --> 28:42.988
So, our sales
for this year

28:42.988 --> 28:44.723
are going to be
about $1.4 million.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.658
Are you going to make
any money on the $1.4 million?

28:46.658 --> 28:48.193
Yeah. This year,
we'll actually book

28:48.193 --> 28:50.229
an accounting profit 'cause
all the deferred revenue

28:50.229 --> 28:51.897
from the presales
counts towards this year.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.332
Do you have any debt
on the company?

28:53.332 --> 28:55.434
Yes, we have some debt
that's actually

28:55.434 --> 28:57.869
into a royalty structure.

28:57.869 --> 28:59.204
What is that?
What is that?
How much?

28:59.204 --> 29:01.740
So there's $392,000
that gives us--

29:01.740 --> 29:04.710
We give 3.92% of our sales
back to that.

29:04.710 --> 29:08.347
It's 3.92% of sales until
you've cleaned that up, right?

29:08.347 --> 29:10.682
That gets
a 1.5 times return.

29:10.682 --> 29:11.883
That sounds like
one of my deals.

29:11.883 --> 29:14.186
Yeah. We're very familiar
with your deals.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.954
So, during COVID
and getting this thing done

29:15.954 --> 29:17.256
in just 15 months,

29:17.256 --> 29:19.224
we went through a middleman
because we can't visit

29:19.224 --> 29:21.226
the factories.
We manufacture in Shenzhen.

29:21.226 --> 29:23.228
And so he's taken
a 20, 30% cut.

29:23.228 --> 29:24.997
We can drop that out
almost instantly.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.098
Wow, there's a lot of guys

29:26.098 --> 29:28.000
taking pieces of the pie
in this deal.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.601
But we got out quick
and we're out

29:29.601 --> 29:31.169
and we're ahead
of competition.

29:31.169 --> 29:33.772
I'm looking at it, and I'm one
of these on-the-fence deals

29:33.772 --> 29:34.773
because I play the game.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.074
I understand
what you've done.

29:36.074 --> 29:38.176
It's a complicated cap table
right now.

29:38.176 --> 29:39.811
It's a complicated structure.

29:39.811 --> 29:41.213
I'm gonna take a pass.
I'm out.

29:42.581 --> 29:45.384
Listen, I think
you did an amazing job,

29:45.384 --> 29:47.586
and I think there's something
really important about

29:47.586 --> 29:50.389
touching and playing on a
board when you're playing chess.

29:50.389 --> 29:52.991
But [Sighs] I'm struggling because...

29:53.992 --> 29:56.728
...I do wonder, how am I going
to make back my money?

29:56.728 --> 30:01.199
If I said I wanted it
for $300,000 for 10%?

30:03.368 --> 30:05.837
It's a tough one.
It really is.

30:05.837 --> 30:07.472
Let-- Can we--

30:07.472 --> 30:08.540
We would love
to work with you,

30:08.540 --> 30:10.575
so let's-- let's
think about this.

30:10.575 --> 30:11.843
We can get you
capital back.

30:11.843 --> 30:13.178
Join in the royalty.

30:13.178 --> 30:14.880
Another royalty?

30:14.880 --> 30:16.515
Yeah, but what would
the royal be?
On the sale.
It's very small.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.083
Tell me. Entice me.
Excite me.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.752
Yeah,
so how about $300,000?

30:21.720 --> 30:23.989
We'll pay you back
3% of every sale

30:23.989 --> 30:28.026
until you're paid back
1.5 times, so $450,000.

30:28.026 --> 30:29.828
We'll give you
the 5% of the company.

30:31.797 --> 30:33.131
That's not a bad counter.

30:33.131 --> 30:35.400
It's not bad at all. Uh...

30:37.202 --> 30:38.203
Guys, let me--
let me just--

30:38.203 --> 30:39.438
I'll take it.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.073
Oh.

30:41.073 --> 30:42.708
It's done, yes?

30:44.676 --> 30:45.977
Deal.
You got a deal.

30:45.977 --> 30:47.746
Whoo!

30:47.746 --> 30:48.747
You guys
are so smart.

30:48.747 --> 30:50.282
Thank you so much.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.217
Whoo! so excited
about this.
So excited
to work with you.

30:52.217 --> 30:53.552
Thank you,
thank you.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.087
Yeah. Thank you, everyone, for
the time. This has been great.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.455
Congrats, guys.
Well done.

30:56.455 --> 30:57.889
Thanks so much.
Good luck.

30:57.889 --> 30:59.458
I'm sorry, Robert.
I had to do it.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.026
Lori is
another royalty,

31:01.026 --> 31:02.661
but they're really not
adding up to much.

31:02.661 --> 31:04.162
We're still under
10% of the sale,

31:04.162 --> 31:05.697
and we got the Shark queen
that we wanted.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.265
It's amazing.
Lori is our queen.

31:16.808 --> 31:21.747
Next up is an easy
way to show your holiday spirit.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.822
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Bill.

31:30.822 --> 31:31.823
And I'm Bill.

31:31.823 --> 31:32.824
And together,
we're the...

31:32.824 --> 31:34.559
Bill Websters.

31:35.694 --> 31:36.828
As you've
probably guessed,

31:36.828 --> 31:38.029
we're
the father-son team

31:38.029 --> 31:40.165
behind
Garage Celebrations.

31:40.165 --> 31:43.835
Sharks, today, we're looking
for a $200,000 investment

31:43.835 --> 31:45.704
for 20% of our business.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.172
You know, decorating
for the holidays

31:47.172 --> 31:48.640
can be a real pain.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.175
You have to crawl up
into your attic,

31:50.175 --> 31:52.177
find that dusty box
of decorations,

31:52.177 --> 31:54.045
pull out
the ratty wreath

31:54.045 --> 31:56.248
and the plastic
candy canes,

31:56.248 --> 31:58.183
and for sure you're going
to find a big wad

31:58.183 --> 32:00.051
of tangled
Christmas lights.

32:00.051 --> 32:01.820
There's gotta be
an easier way.

32:01.820 --> 32:04.489
Sharks, the outdoor
holiday decorating industry

32:04.489 --> 32:06.224
is multi-billion dollar,

32:06.224 --> 32:07.926
whether it's
Christmas lights,

32:07.926 --> 32:09.561
Halloween graveyards
in the front yard,

32:09.561 --> 32:11.496
or flags on
the 4th of July.

32:11.496 --> 32:12.631
But most people
are missing

32:12.631 --> 32:13.899
the opportunity
to decorate

32:13.899 --> 32:15.801
the largest surface
on their home.

32:15.801 --> 32:18.637
Introducing
Garage Celebrations.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.605
Our decorative
garage door covers

32:20.605 --> 32:22.641
fit on most residential
garage doors,

32:22.641 --> 32:25.510
both in one car
and two-car sizes.

32:25.510 --> 32:27.446
Better yet, they're
super easy to install

32:27.446 --> 32:30.515
and require no tools,
clips, cords, or tape.

32:30.515 --> 32:33.218
And the best part is
our flexible covers stretch

32:33.218 --> 32:35.854
with the opening and closing
of the garage door

32:35.854 --> 32:38.790
so it doesn't impede
the operation of the door.

32:38.790 --> 32:39.858
What's cool is
we have covers

32:39.858 --> 32:41.760
for all the major
holidays and events,

32:41.760 --> 32:42.894
everything from Christmas

32:42.894 --> 32:44.930
to Halloween
to the 4th of July.

32:44.930 --> 32:48.967
Our covers are reusable,
they're machine washable,

32:48.967 --> 32:51.002
and they fold
for easy storage.

32:51.002 --> 32:52.270
So how about it,
Sharks?

32:52.270 --> 32:53.305
Who wants to help us

32:53.305 --> 32:56.241
turn America's boring
garage doors into...

32:56.241 --> 32:58.143
Garage
Celebrations?!

32:58.143 --> 33:00.145
Ta-da!

33:00.145 --> 33:01.213
So, Sharks,
in front of you,

33:01.213 --> 33:03.281
you each have one of
our more popular covers.

33:03.281 --> 33:05.350
Robert, we gave you Santa
for Christmas.

33:05.350 --> 33:06.818
Well, because I'm jolly.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.453
There you go.

33:08.453 --> 33:10.088
Lori, we gave you
the smiling pumpkins

33:10.088 --> 33:11.723
for Halloween.
Love it.

33:11.723 --> 33:13.859
Mr. Wonderful,
we gave you Frankenstein.

33:13.859 --> 33:15.260
Now, Kevin,
don't read into that. Nice.

33:15.260 --> 33:16.595
Don't read into that.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.096
Barbara, we gave you
our dogs for--

33:18.096 --> 33:19.764
Christmas dogs.
That's my dog on there,
by the way.

33:19.764 --> 33:20.899
Exactly.
I'm suing you.

33:20.899 --> 33:22.968
And, Mark, we gave you

33:22.968 --> 33:24.536
an American flag
for the 4th of July.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.137
Yes, sir. Thank you.

33:26.137 --> 33:28.273
Guys,
it's really cool.

33:28.273 --> 33:30.876
Is there other
products out there?

33:30.876 --> 33:33.478
There is, actually. Oh.

33:33.478 --> 33:35.847
There are vinyl covers

33:35.847 --> 33:38.850
that have clips
and screws.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.352
And do they rip and tear?

33:40.352 --> 33:41.353
They do.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.420
Have you ever seen
a vinyl cover

33:42.420 --> 33:43.822
that isn't creased?

33:43.822 --> 33:45.757
Yeah, they degrade. Mm-hmm.
They're shiny and look bad.

33:45.757 --> 33:48.793
Would you explain to me how
it attaches to the garage
door?

33:48.793 --> 33:50.495
Ah! There
is the trick.
Ah!

33:50.495 --> 33:51.930
So the magic sauce.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.632
This is
the Santa Claus...

33:53.632 --> 33:55.200
Ho! Ho! Ho!
...that Robert has.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.101
There he is.

33:56.101 --> 33:58.837
The fabric,
it's 6% spandex,

33:58.837 --> 34:01.039
so it's like a big pair
of Lululemon

34:01.039 --> 34:03.208
yoga pants.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.910
The important part
is the connection.

34:04.910 --> 34:06.478
And at each corner
of the cover,

34:06.478 --> 34:07.646
there's a cutout.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.080
Now, we call this
the collar.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.248
We've gone ahead
and mocked up

34:10.248 --> 34:11.816
a corner of
a garage door for you.

34:11.816 --> 34:13.552
You will open your
garage door a little bit

34:13.552 --> 34:15.954
just so you have access
to all four corners.

34:15.954 --> 34:18.657
You'll take the collar,
you'll wrap it around the corner

34:18.657 --> 34:22.360
of the garage door,
and then zip up the collar...

34:22.360 --> 34:23.795
Oh, that's smart.
...on all four corners.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.063
Clever, yeah.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.398
- That is clever.
- So easy.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.599
Even <i>I</i> could do it.

34:27.599 --> 34:29.467
There we go.
There we go, got it.

34:29.467 --> 34:30.936
Because the fabric stretches,

34:30.936 --> 34:32.737
it can accommodate
a wide range,

34:32.737 --> 34:34.072
so we're
able to fit on

34:34.072 --> 34:35.473
almost everyone's garage door,
have it look fantastic.

34:35.473 --> 34:37.175
Plus or minus
4 or 5 inches, actually

34:37.175 --> 34:38.710
O'Leary: Okay,
but, Bill Squared,

34:38.710 --> 34:40.078
okay,
let me ask you something.

34:40.078 --> 34:43.248
Because over the years,
we've seen many holiday items.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.683
Right.
And the big issue

34:44.683 --> 34:46.618
with all of them
is seasonality.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.987
How do you know which style,
which colors,

34:48.987 --> 34:51.690
which sizes to order, because
you have to have them there

34:51.690 --> 34:52.991
just before
the holidays hit?

34:52.991 --> 34:54.192
Well, we don't yet

34:54.192 --> 34:56.795
because we're
just starting now.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.497
Oh, you're
pre-revenue!

34:59.497 --> 35:01.232
No.
No, we're not.

35:01.232 --> 35:03.001
They sold one to Grandma!
Yeah!

35:03.001 --> 35:05.537
We have $175,000
in sales.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.138
Over what period of time?
That's good.

35:07.138 --> 35:09.574
Just took delivery of
the product last week
and delivered--

35:09.574 --> 35:11.042
Oh, my God.
Oh, wow.

35:11.042 --> 35:12.210
Oh, so where did you
pre-sell them?

35:12.210 --> 35:14.245
Largest Halloween retailer
in the country.

35:14.245 --> 35:15.981
They ordered
sight unseen.

35:15.981 --> 35:18.516
Bill,
what do you sell this for?

35:18.516 --> 35:23.254
That one-car garage door cover
sells for $120,

35:23.254 --> 35:25.457
and our landed cost
is $35.

35:25.457 --> 35:28.560
So what are you selling it
to that retailer for?

35:28.560 --> 35:31.029
About $43.
What?

35:31.029 --> 35:32.864
$43? That's not enough.
$43?

35:32.864 --> 35:34.165
This deal, we said,

35:34.165 --> 35:36.134
"Well, we can't afford to
really turn down that order."

35:36.134 --> 35:38.870
But you made the mistake of
telling them it was $129
retail,

35:38.870 --> 35:40.138
and they wanted
half off, right?

35:40.138 --> 35:41.673
Yeah.
Oh, they wanted 70% off.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.274
They wanted
a ton off.
We wish.

35:43.274 --> 35:44.809
The material's
coming in right now.
Alright, so, I'm really curious.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.111
You've just started this.

35:46.111 --> 35:47.112
Right.
Yeah.

35:47.112 --> 35:48.580
What made you
come up with this?

35:48.580 --> 35:50.348
Is it your full-time job?

35:50.348 --> 35:51.916
I've been
a serial entrepreneur,

35:51.916 --> 35:55.153
and a couple years ago,
I retired.

35:55.153 --> 35:58.289
And so I did an add-on
to the house

35:58.289 --> 36:00.458
and I did all my honey do's
for my wife.

36:01.459 --> 36:02.694
I played
a little golf.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.062
And I was depressed.

36:04.062 --> 36:05.864
I hated being retired.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.866
I want my phone to ring
with something

36:07.866 --> 36:09.300
other than
somebody offering

36:09.300 --> 36:11.603
to renew the warranty
on my car.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.606
And so I started
looking at it,

36:14.606 --> 36:16.941
saying, "I got to find
something else to do."

36:16.941 --> 36:18.309
And I've always been
playing around

36:18.309 --> 36:20.779
with this idea of these
garage door covers.

36:20.779 --> 36:22.280
And so I turned
to my son,

36:22.280 --> 36:25.383
who's the Harvard
architect graduate,

36:25.383 --> 36:28.586
and said, "Hey, can you
help me productize this?"

36:28.586 --> 36:30.321
So, I had enough skill
to look at it and say,

36:30.321 --> 36:31.556
"Okay,
how do we take this

36:31.556 --> 36:33.558
beyond just putting
a sign on a garage?"

36:33.558 --> 36:34.626
Right?
"How do we protect it?

36:34.626 --> 36:36.127
How do we patent
the attachment?"

36:36.127 --> 36:38.396
And ultimately,
"How do we make it easy?"

36:38.396 --> 36:40.632
You know, it's not always easy
working with your dad.

36:40.632 --> 36:43.568
However, our skills
are fantastic together,

36:43.568 --> 36:44.703
and we've done
a heck of a lot.

36:44.703 --> 36:45.770
O'Leary:
Okay, guys.

36:45.770 --> 36:46.838
Okay.
Come at us, Kevin.

36:46.838 --> 36:49.140
Come back.
Why is this worth $1 million?

36:49.140 --> 36:51.276
You haven't made
a dime on it yet,

36:51.276 --> 36:52.577
including that order

36:52.577 --> 36:54.646
which you gave away
for basically your cost.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.314
So why is it worth $1 million?

36:56.314 --> 36:57.582
Because it's not proprietary.

36:57.582 --> 36:58.950
You told me there's
lots of other guys doing it.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.685
No, it <i>is</i> proprietary.
It is.

37:00.685 --> 37:02.954
What's proprietary about it,
the collar?

37:02.954 --> 37:06.157
The utility patent
on the collar itself.

37:06.157 --> 37:08.660
But, Bill, how are you going
to generate more sales?

37:08.660 --> 37:11.129
We're going to do social.
Social, social, social.

37:11.129 --> 37:12.530
Show people
how this works.

37:12.530 --> 37:14.899
And who has that specialty?
Who knows how to do it?

37:14.899 --> 37:16.701
Is your dad
big on Instagram?

37:17.736 --> 37:18.737
No, not yet.

37:18.737 --> 37:19.971
Not yet,
but he's gonna be.

37:22.607 --> 37:23.708
Who did your designs?

37:24.976 --> 37:26.277
Oh.
He did.

37:26.277 --> 37:28.146
I want to start with
the design, If I might.

37:28.146 --> 37:30.381
And please don't
be offended, alright?

37:39.190 --> 37:42.293
All Sharks are in,
and Barbara has a critique

37:42.293 --> 37:45.930
on the design of Bill and
Bill's garage decoration product,

37:45.930 --> 37:47.966
Garage Celebrations.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.367
Please don't be offended,

37:49.367 --> 37:52.537
but my first impression of
this product is it looks dated.

37:52.537 --> 37:54.873
It's the design elements
that don't look fresh.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.841
The letter style
doesn't look right to me.

37:56.841 --> 37:59.911
Just the whole thing looks
dated and not that attractive.

37:59.911 --> 38:03.181
Mm-hmm.
I just don't see this
going anywhere, honestly.

38:03.181 --> 38:04.983
So for that reason,
I'm out.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.017
Oh.

38:07.018 --> 38:08.086
"Don't be
offended by it."
Thanks anyway.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.621
But don't be offended.
We're not.

38:09.621 --> 38:11.222
We won't be.
We're lucky
to be here.

38:11.222 --> 38:14.058
I guess I have a little bit
of a different spin on it.

38:14.058 --> 38:16.761
I love this one. Yeah.

38:16.761 --> 38:19.264
Halloween happens to be,
like, my favorite holiday.

38:19.264 --> 38:20.832
This, I think,
looks beautiful.

38:20.832 --> 38:23.802
To Barbara's point, some of
the others, you could change,

38:23.802 --> 38:25.970
but that's an easy fix.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.072
I think this is
perfectly doable

38:28.072 --> 38:30.175
and a nice business
for you guys.

38:30.175 --> 38:33.978
But for me, I don't think it's
the right kind of investment.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.013
Oh.
I'm sorry to hear that.

38:35.013 --> 38:36.014
I'm out.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.115
Thanks.
Thanks for the feedback.

38:37.115 --> 38:38.183
What are you gonna do
with the money?

38:38.183 --> 38:39.684
There's a couple things.

38:39.684 --> 38:42.754
One is these are being made
in Vietnam right now.

38:42.754 --> 38:46.825
It's taking like five months
from order to landed.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.059
Right.
Your challenge though, guys--

38:48.059 --> 38:49.961
Look, the real money
is going to come

38:49.961 --> 38:51.996
from customized versions, right?

38:51.996 --> 38:54.499
So how does that work if
you've got a five-month lead
time?

38:54.499 --> 38:55.767
Well, it doesn't, actually.

38:55.767 --> 38:58.937
One, personalized covers
can command a little more money.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.338
Yeah.
And, secondly--

39:00.338 --> 39:02.373
It's also going to take
a lot more work.

39:02.373 --> 39:03.908
Do you have any software developed

39:03.908 --> 39:06.611
that lets people upload
their high-res JPEG?

39:06.611 --> 39:08.379
Right.
That's where we're going.

39:08.379 --> 39:11.082
So tell me about that,
because that's the real
chance for the company.

39:11.082 --> 39:13.284
We can actually start
to do it now.

39:13.284 --> 39:17.021
Our manufacturer in Vietnam
is ready to take--

39:17.021 --> 39:21.092
We basically just e-mail them
the graphic, he makes it.

39:21.092 --> 39:24.195
So, I-- I don't agree with
the customization.

39:24.195 --> 39:27.866
I look at the two of you,
I love you guys,

39:27.866 --> 39:32.570
but how do I
invest $200,000 for 20%?

39:32.570 --> 39:35.573
And then, what,
we go out and hire somebody

39:35.573 --> 39:38.443
to be the brains
of the social media rollout?

39:38.443 --> 39:40.211
We would like some help
getting us--

39:40.211 --> 39:41.913
You know, we've got everything
under way.

39:41.913 --> 39:44.649
Alright, guys, look,
there's a person missing here

39:44.649 --> 39:47.685
that's going to do that for
you, because in reality,

39:47.685 --> 39:50.722
what's happened is
the cost of customer acquisition

39:50.722 --> 39:53.391
has gone up,
in some cases 80%.

39:53.391 --> 39:57.428
And so strategies now have
moved to more of a community structure

39:57.428 --> 40:00.298
so that you build word of
mouth on platforms like TikTok.

40:00.298 --> 40:03.534
Right.
And you have to be
very sophisticated to do it,

40:03.534 --> 40:08.339
because this product would
sell well in 59 seconds on TikTok

40:08.339 --> 40:10.041
if you knew how to do it.

40:10.041 --> 40:11.609
Look, I love it,

40:11.609 --> 40:13.745
but I don't see an opportunity
to make a lot of money here.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.346
So I'm sorry, guys.
I'm out.

40:15.346 --> 40:16.381
Bill. Bill.
Thanks, Kevin.
Appreciate it.

40:16.381 --> 40:18.383
I love the product.
Love you guys.

40:18.383 --> 40:22.420
But there's something
really big missing in this deal.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.188
And that's a third Bill.

40:24.188 --> 40:27.058
Somebody that understands
e-commerce

40:27.058 --> 40:30.228
and socially driven marketing
and all that kind of stuff. Right.

40:30.228 --> 40:32.196
I'm not saying
you can't learn it... Yeah.

40:32.196 --> 40:34.732
...but from where you are
today to get to that path,

40:34.732 --> 40:35.800
it's going to be
a long road.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.669
I wish you were
farther along,

40:37.669 --> 40:40.438
but because the third Bill
isn't here, I can't be in.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.639
I'm out.
I'm sorry.

40:41.639 --> 40:42.774
Appreciate it.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.275
So, guys,
that leads me to a question.

40:44.275 --> 40:45.910
So you order the materials...

40:45.910 --> 40:46.911
Fabric.
Fabric.

40:46.911 --> 40:47.912
...and then you
send it to them

40:47.912 --> 40:49.113
in Vietnam.
Mm-hmm.
Yep.

40:49.113 --> 40:50.648
And what kind of
machine do they use

40:50.648 --> 40:52.350
to cut it and print it?

40:52.350 --> 40:55.520
They're using a six-foot
dye sublimation printer.

40:55.520 --> 40:58.122
We want to buy our own
machine. That would make it cheap...

40:58.122 --> 40:59.857
And what does the machine
cost? ...if we bought our own machine.

40:59.857 --> 41:02.026
The machine costs
about $60,000, $80,000.

41:02.026 --> 41:03.227
- That's all?
- That's it?

41:03.227 --> 41:05.663
Yeah. So we could buy a
machine. That'd be an option.

41:05.663 --> 41:06.931
So let me get this straight, then.

41:06.931 --> 41:08.933
You guys could take
this money... Yeah.

41:08.933 --> 41:10.902
...buy a machine... Yep.

41:10.902 --> 41:12.070
...do it all in your garage.

41:12.070 --> 41:13.004
Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

41:13.004 --> 41:14.305
Then you could build to order.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.406
Yeah.
I just like it

41:15.406 --> 41:16.641
'cause I can
make some for the Mavs.

41:16.641 --> 41:17.976
And I just, like,
if the price is low enough--

41:17.976 --> 41:19.510
Why don't you buy them
instead? What's that?

41:19.510 --> 41:21.879
Why don't you buy the banners
instead?

41:21.879 --> 41:24.315
Yeah, but these guys are fun
and they can do most of the work.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.917
Yeah, exactly.
That's what we're here to do.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.819
He's got a lot of money,
this guy.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.120
So, I'll make you an offer.

41:29.120 --> 41:32.523
I'll give you the 200K.
I want 30% of the company.

41:32.523 --> 41:33.791
30%.
Phew.

41:33.791 --> 41:35.560
Well...
I would just say yes.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.862
What did you think was going
to happen in "Shark Tank"?

41:37.862 --> 41:40.498
Well, you keep it
entertaining. Sharky offer.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.834
Right?
That's not sharky.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.770
Mark...

41:45.770 --> 41:47.238
You got a deal. Done.

41:48.873 --> 41:50.808
Good job.
I just think it's gonna be fun.

41:50.808 --> 41:51.943
- Thanks, man.
- Appreciate it, man.

41:51.943 --> 41:53.111
I appreciate it.
Good to meet you.

41:53.111 --> 41:54.479
Dad, enjoy.
Thanks a lot.

41:54.479 --> 41:56.381
Thanks, Mark.
You got it. Appreciate it.

41:56.381 --> 41:57.982
Thank you all, everyone.
Really appreciate it.
Thanks, everybody.

41:57.982 --> 42:00.084
Enjoy your day.
Thank you.

42:00.084 --> 42:01.686
Alright!
Alright!

42:01.686 --> 42:02.820
We're there. Alright.

42:02.820 --> 42:04.322
That was cool. Yes.

42:04.322 --> 42:06.257
Boom!

42:06.257 --> 42:08.693
So, Mark,
you're the third Bill.

42:08.693 --> 42:09.894
Yeah.

42:09.894 --> 42:11.295
You just liked them,
basically, right?

42:11.295 --> 42:14.098
Yeah, I like these guys.
It'll be fun for my kids.

42:14.098 --> 42:17.135
It'll be fun for the
community. It'll be fun for
the Mavs.

42:17.135 --> 42:19.137
You know what? Let's not even
call it "Shark Tank" anymore.

42:19.137 --> 42:20.605
Let's call it
the Fun Tank.

42:20.605 --> 42:22.507
Yeah, well, that's where you
can make a lot of money sometimes,

42:22.507 --> 42:24.342
doing a business
that you have fun with.
