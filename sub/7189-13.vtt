10:21.746 --> 10:23.706
Daniel says
you're great at making plans.

10:23.789 --> 10:27.543
It's one of
your many great qualities.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.045
- I am.
It's true.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.546
- And you know Emma best,

10:30.629 --> 10:34.967
so you're my--
I mean, our best weapon.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.386
- Oh!
Get a pen and paper.

10:37.470 --> 10:37.845
I dictate.
You write.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.229
Oh, what a cool-looking trunk.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.064
What do you keep in here?

10:48.147 --> 10:49.273
- Don't open it!

10:49.357 --> 10:50.983
Step away.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.861
Nobody opens my trunk.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.031
- Oh!

10:57.114 --> 10:58.407
"Don't touch my trunk.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.951
That's where I keep my Hexoren
and all my magic stuff."

11:01.035 --> 11:02.745
- No, I don't!

11:02.828 --> 11:05.081
Why are you so interested
in the hex-a-gram anyway?

11:05.164 --> 11:10.669
- So you can cast some spells
and we can have some fun.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.588
- I'm in.
- Me too.

11:12.671 --> 11:14.673
- Now get the Hexoren,
and let's get our cray-cray on.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.761
- I don't know what that means.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.262
- It means
we're gonna conjure up

11:20.346 --> 11:22.098
some serious crazy here.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.558
- Yes!

11:24.642 --> 11:25.810
- Andi's right.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.144
You never conjured
any real cray-cray for us.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.397
- Fine.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.149
Let's conjure up
some serious cray.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.110
- Yay!

11:39.490 --> 11:41.617
- Let's try something easy.

11:41.700 --> 11:42.701
Which one first, Andi?

11:44.161 --> 11:45.579
[sighs]

11:49.500 --> 11:52.461
It's past its prime.
It's sung its tune.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.921
So turn this flower
into a spoon.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.135
Whoa.

11:59.218 --> 12:02.179
As Andi would say,
"That was way pitiful, dude."

12:11.564 --> 12:14.150
It's kind of drab and faded
from the sun.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.527
Make this couch look
a bit more fun.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.656

12:27.580 --> 12:28.539
Hey, Tony.

12:28.622 --> 12:29.832
What are you doing here?

12:29.915 --> 12:31.542
- Well, you looked
a little upset at school,

12:31.625 --> 12:33.169
so I brought over
my favorite sudoku books.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.379
- Oh.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.214
That's thoughtful of you.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.549
Uh, come on in.

12:42.761 --> 12:43.679
- Re-decorating?

12:43.762 --> 12:45.264
- You could say that.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.267
- So are you practicing magic?

12:48.350 --> 12:49.518
- Trying.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.479
- Well, that's how you become

12:51.562 --> 12:52.438
a great magician.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.023
You practice, practice,
practice,

12:54.106 --> 12:55.316
and when you think
you can't practice anymore--

12:55.399 --> 12:57.485
- Keep practicing.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.570
- Actually,
have a ham sandwich.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.113
Then you keep practicing.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.032
- I'll keep that in mind.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.658
- So you need any help?

13:04.742 --> 13:06.160
- I don't know.

13:08.954 --> 13:09.371
- [sighs]

13:09.455 --> 13:11.790
Hi, Coach.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.210
Dude, you parked far away
from everything.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.544
- So no one will see you here.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.963
We have a lot to work on,
so let's get started.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.131
- Yes, sir!

13:19.215 --> 13:20.799
- Hey, I'm serious.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.843
I'm already risking enough
doing this.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.053
Are you ready?

13:24.136 --> 13:25.596
- Yeah, but I don't really
understand

13:25.679 --> 13:27.890
the whole Kanay thing.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.142
- Right now, the most important
thing for you to know

13:30.226 --> 13:32.269
is to stay away from witches.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.812
- [scoffs]
Witches?

13:33.896 --> 13:36.607
Well, that'll be easy
because they don't exist.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.943
- Okay, we have a lot more work
to do than I thought.

13:39.026 --> 13:42.571
Let's start simple,
a fireball.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.949
Can you really, really
conce--

13:51.830 --> 13:53.207
Whoa.

13:53.290 --> 13:54.750
- Like that?

13:59.964 --> 14:03.133
- So I just shimmy this way
and turn that way.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.928
And...

14:06.011 --> 14:07.179
Ta-da!

14:07.846 --> 14:09.765
- Do you want some help?

14:09.848 --> 14:11.809
- Uh, no, no, I got this.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.769
- I'm stepping in.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.771
He couldn't get out in a snap,

14:15.854 --> 14:17.565
so release Tony from his trap.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.654
- Emma!

14:24.572 --> 14:26.282
That was great!

14:26.365 --> 14:28.033
You cast a spell
at the spur of the moment,

14:28.117 --> 14:29.618
and it worked perfectly!

14:29.702 --> 14:31.203
You must work well
under pressure.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.330
- You know what?
I do!

back into human-Lily

14:35.791 --> 14:37.126

14:37.209 --> 14:38.252

you didn't erase my memory?

a great job
