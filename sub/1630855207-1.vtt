02:04.332 --> 02:06.751
Perhaps you should focus on your skills

02:06.751 --> 02:08.461
instead of showing off.

02:09.796 --> 02:12.590
Perhaps you should catch your breath
before trying to talk.

02:15.176 --> 02:18.221
Give it back.

02:24.060 --> 02:26.855
You don't even know how to use it.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.237
That's enough!

03:20.200 --> 03:21.534
Stop!

03:23.119 --> 03:24.871
You don't have to do this.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.008
Yes, I do.

03:55.109 --> 03:59.614
<i>Customer needs assistance in frozen food.</i>

04:03.409 --> 04:05.787
Jin, how about this one?

04:07.497 --> 04:10.625
Uh, I don't think so, Mom.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.502
This one?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.921
Yeah. No.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.798
You need clothes for tomorrow, Jin.

04:16.798 --> 04:20.301
Mom, I'm starting tenth grade,
not directing airport traffic.

04:20.301 --> 04:23.221
Why so picky? This is a hip store.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.515
Is it, Mom? 'Cause they also sell milk.

04:26.224 --> 04:27.433
This one?

04:27.433 --> 04:29.519
Yeah, I don't think I'm that guy.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.563
Okay, then. What guy are you, huh?

04:32.563 --> 04:36.776
Uh, skateboard guy,
camping guy, handsome guy?

04:36.776 --> 04:38.486
Yeah, you think that mannequin's handsome?

04:38.486 --> 04:39.988
Yeah. He's good-looking.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.865
What about your friend New-jee?
Where does he shop?

04:42.865 --> 04:45.785
His name's Anuj.
Wait, have you been calling him "New-jee"?

04:45.785 --> 04:47.704
You know who I was talking about.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.580
Also, we don't really hang anymore.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.666
Why not?

04:51.666 --> 04:53.668
You know, I had club soccer
over the summer

04:53.668 --> 04:55.044
and he was busy with cosplay.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.255
Who-- Who's that?

04:58.298 --> 05:01.884
Cosplay, Mom. It's where you dress up
as, like, a warrior or a sexy demon.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.429
- What?
- Yeah, it's too hard to explain.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.557
So, who are you gonna read
your comic books with?

05:07.557 --> 05:09.434
I was thinking this year
I'd try to switch it up.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.770
And, like, you know, get on another level.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.439
So, what level are you now?

05:15.231 --> 05:16.566
In a lobby.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.943
Parking.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.575
- Hey, Mom?
- Mmm?

05:25.575 --> 05:28.411
Uh, what do you think about this one?

05:28.411 --> 05:29.495
How much?

05:29.495 --> 05:31.080
It is...

05:32.123 --> 05:33.207
80.

05:35.793 --> 05:36.919
Uh, here.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.173
Try this on. Good price.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.216
Less is more!

05:44.969 --> 05:46.012
Yeah.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.765
I guess it's all right.

05:48.765 --> 05:49.891
Mom?

05:50.933 --> 05:52.310
Mom?

05:54.270 --> 05:55.897
Sorry, I thought you were my mom.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.691
I didn't think--
I didn't think you were my mom.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.319
My mom was standing there a second ago,
so that's why I said that.

06:03.237 --> 06:04.530
Hot stuff.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.252
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, you like it?

06:19.212 --> 06:20.213
Chili's cute, huh?

06:21.214 --> 06:23.841
I don't. No, I-- N-no.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.803
Okay, I give up. Let's go home.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.431
Wait. I need to get some milk first.
Bring the cart, huh?

06:57.792 --> 06:59.585
<i>What could go Wong?</i>

07:48.384 --> 07:51.179
You said you would ask about the raise.

07:51.179 --> 07:54.599
I'm not talking about money right now.

08:26.672 --> 08:27.882
Jin,

08:27.882 --> 08:29.467
did you wear clean underwear?

08:29.967 --> 08:32.553
- What?
- Did you wear clean underwear?

08:32.553 --> 08:35.806
Yeah, I did, Mom.
What kind of a question is that?

08:35.806 --> 08:38.726
Sometimes I see your underwear
in the hamper and they're dirty.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.978
Yeah. Right.
Yes, that's why they're in the hamper.

08:40.978 --> 08:42.063
- Oh.
- Right?

08:42.063 --> 08:43.606
- Okay, I'm just gonna hop out here.
- Huh?

08:43.606 --> 08:45.358
- I'll see you at 3:00, okay?
- Wait, wait.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.653
- Okay. Have a good day.
- Yeah.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.405
- Don't fight. Don't talk back to teacher.
- Thanks. See you at 3:00, Mom.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.596
Anuj! Hey!

09:25.022 --> 09:28.609
Awful! This guy!

09:28.609 --> 09:30.695
- You can't!
- That's so funny.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.947
- Hey. What's up, guys?
- What's up, man?

09:32.947 --> 09:34.991
- Yo.
- What, uh-- What are we laughing about?

09:36.367 --> 09:38.536
Travis was telling us
about his mom's boyfriend.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.997
- Tell him. Tell him.
- Okay. So--

09:40.997 --> 09:44.083
So, his name is Spencer, right?
And we went to the pool the other day,

09:44.083 --> 09:46.711
so this is the first time I'd seen him
without his shirt.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.963
And he's got a back tattoo.
You know what it says?

09:48.963 --> 09:50.423
- What?
- "Spencer."

09:52.466 --> 09:53.718
Who does that?

09:53.718 --> 09:56.304
He does have a sick-ass boat though,
which we should all go on.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.264
- You have been waterskiing, right?
- Yeah.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.807
- Right? Cool.
- Yeah, of course.

09:59.807 --> 10:02.685
What are you guys talking about?
Puberty? That's cute.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.145
What's up, Greg?

10:04.145 --> 10:07.690
Yo. So, Coach Garrett wants me to round up
some more guys for JV tryouts tomorrow.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.776
It's not really my problem anymore, so
you dudes need to hand out these flyers.

10:10.776 --> 10:11.902
Yeah. Sure.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.112
What's your name, bro?

10:13.654 --> 10:15.281
Ah, uh, Jin Wang.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.075
- Greg. Varsity cap.
- Hi.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.535
You play soccer?

10:19.535 --> 10:21.787
Yeah. Or--
Sort of. I don't know.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.164
Love the confidence.

10:23.164 --> 10:26.167
He plays. He was on our team this summer.
Solid midfielder.

10:26.167 --> 10:29.420
Nice. Yeah, that's my position.
You should come to tryouts tomorrow.

10:29.420 --> 10:33.966
- Should be a decent squad this year.
- Yeah. Uh, sure. Thanks.

10:34.508 --> 10:37.303
Hey, don't worry, man. You just gotta be
better than this little turd.

10:38.554 --> 10:39.680
Yeah.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.644
Hey, Andy says you're a solid player,
so you should come.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.022
Yeah, thanks. I appreciate that.

11:04.455 --> 11:07.750
Here, here. Sometimes you have to--

11:07.750 --> 11:08.834
Yeah.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.427
All right. Welcome to Bio 2.

11:18.427 --> 11:22.306
I'm Mr. Larkins, and we're gonna
start the year off with evolution.

11:22.306 --> 11:26.435
Now, contrary to popular belief,
it's not all smooth and easy.

11:26.435 --> 11:29.397
It's actually a brutal battle
for survival.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.732
Which is why my ex-wife is on the chart.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.735
She's the second monkey from the left.

11:34.735 --> 11:38.447
Not cool, Mr. Larkins. You shouldn't
comment on a woman's appearance.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.450
You're absolutely right, Ruby.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.537
Uh, that was not funny and I apologize.

11:45.287 --> 11:49.125
Speaking of natural selection,
our first unit is a partner project.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.211
So, everybody, find a primate
and let's pair up. All right? Get to it.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.180
Oh, hey, Mr. "Hot Stuff."

12:03.723 --> 12:07.768
Yea-- Yes. Ye-Yeah.
"Hot Stuff." That's me.

12:07.768 --> 12:11.689
- Amelia.
- Uh, Jin. It's nice to meet you, sort of.

12:11.689 --> 12:12.690
Sort of?

12:12.690 --> 12:16.026
I meant we sort of know each other 'cause
we went to elementary school together.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.779
Then you went to Crest Road Intermediate,
I went to Dorothy Nichols Middle.

12:18.779 --> 12:21.615
And now I'm kind of creeping myself out.
I should-- I should stop.

12:21.615 --> 12:25.119
You know, I think I do remember you.
Well, you kind of stand out, obviously.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.205
- I do?
- Hey, you're trying out for soccer?

12:28.205 --> 12:30.958
Yeah. Or, you know, I don't know. Maybe.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.376
No, that's cool.

12:32.376 --> 12:33.919
I was actually gonna try out too,

12:33.919 --> 12:37.631
but, um, my mom wants me to do drama
because she did drama in high school,

12:37.631 --> 12:40.134
and apparently we have to have
all the same interests.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.178
Are your parents ever like that?

12:42.178 --> 12:43.387
Uh, I'm--

12:43.387 --> 12:46.474
I'm not actually sure
if my parents have any interests.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.019
So, did you, uh,
end up getting that hoodie?

12:50.019 --> 12:52.480
- Yeah, I got like eight of 'em.
- Eight?

12:52.480 --> 12:53.981
One for every day of the week,

12:53.981 --> 12:56.484
and then one more for laundry day,
in case I forget.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.860
Do you think I could get one?

12:57.860 --> 12:59.403
No, it's a collection.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.990
Got it.

13:05.576 --> 13:08.829
So, do you, um--
Do you have a lab partner yet?

13:11.832 --> 13:15.669
Ah, Principal Kinney,
to what do we owe this honor?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.130
- What?
- I just-- I don't know.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.675
Hey, everyone.
Um, is there a Jim Wang here?

13:22.259 --> 13:23.844
Jim Wang?

13:25.513 --> 13:27.431
Wang.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.475
Can I borrow you for a second?

13:33.270 --> 13:34.647
Ooh!

13:34.647 --> 13:36.524
- Okay. Please.
- I know. I know.

13:37.149 --> 13:40.069
So, uh, what's going on?

13:43.697 --> 13:48.077
Oh. Uh, so sorry,
b-but my Chinese isn't super good.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.371
- Oh.
- Uh, well, this is Wayne Chung.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.331
- Wei-Chen.
- He's a new student

13:52.331 --> 13:53.791
and he's Chinese, like you.

13:54.625 --> 13:55.626
Uh, okay.

13:55.626 --> 13:59.588
I thought that you could show him around
since you two have so much in common.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.173
Uh, we do?

14:01.173 --> 14:03.801
So, for the rest of the day,
he's gonna be your shadow.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.219
Sorry, my what?

14:05.219 --> 14:08.389
Well, he's gonna tag along with you
to all of your classes,

14:08.389 --> 14:12.393
except English,
because he's ESL, and math.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.145
He's way ahead of you in math.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.524
You excited? Have fun.

14:31.495 --> 14:34.707
Hi. My name is Sun Wei-Chen.

14:35.666 --> 14:36.834
Nice to meet you.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.142
- So, do you want to get started?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.108
- Yo.
- Hey.

15:01.108 --> 15:04.486
- We're, uh, over on the bricks.
- Oh, awesome. Cool. I'll, uh--

15:04.486 --> 15:09.575
Jin! Jin! I found seats for us!

15:09.575 --> 15:12.328
Come on! Here. Right here.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.079
Oh, you're, uh, sitting with someone.

15:14.079 --> 15:16.248
- It's all good. Don't worry about it.
- No.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.919
Come on. Can you see me?

15:29.428 --> 15:31.805
Jin, would you like some <i>luóbo gao</i>?

15:32.431 --> 15:34.016
Uh, no, thanks.

15:34.892 --> 15:35.976
Okay.

15:37.478 --> 15:41.357
Um, Jin, do you like barbecue sauce?

15:42.733 --> 15:43.984
Not really, dude.

15:44.735 --> 15:45.736
Okay.

15:48.822 --> 15:50.783
Oh, Jin, do you like humorous films?

15:50.783 --> 15:53.577
You don't have to say my name
every time, okay? You can just talk.

15:53.577 --> 15:55.120
Oh, okay.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.375
Oh, Jin! Oh, yeah.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.669
Sorry.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.432
Who's that?

16:16.266 --> 16:22.106
This? Oh. This is from
a popular manga called <i>Kugo Ren Saga</i>.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.316
- Uh, yeah, no. I know <i>Kugo Ren</i>.
- Oh, you do?

16:24.316 --> 16:27.027
Yeah, I just-- I didn't recognize
the character. Who is that?

16:27.027 --> 16:29.989
This is Kugo Ren from book four.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.658
No, that's not Kugo Ren.
Also, there's only three books.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.827
No, there's seven.

16:36.453 --> 16:39.081
Yeah.
Maybe some have not come to America yet.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.209
Ah, here. Let me show you.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.045
- Ah, w-wait, uh, hold on.
- What?

16:46.505 --> 16:48.132
- What up, Jin?
- Hey, 'sup, Trav?

16:48.132 --> 16:50.759
Uh, Andy said you couldn't
have lunch with us today

16:50.759 --> 16:53.303
because you made a new friend.

16:53.303 --> 16:57.182
What's up, man? I'm Travis.
This is Josh. What's your name?

16:57.182 --> 16:59.309
Um, Wei-Chen. Nice to meet you.

16:59.309 --> 17:02.604
Nice to meet you. I like that shirt, man.
Where'd you get it?

17:02.604 --> 17:04.064
Oh. Oh, this? Um--

17:04.064 --> 17:06.150
This is from a-a Chinese company.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.485
Uh, you can buy this on their website.

17:08.485 --> 17:10.988
Oh. No way, I love websites.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.740
I gotta check that out.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.242
You know, I've been meaning
to wear more robot shirts.

17:16.493 --> 17:17.870
Um...

17:18.495 --> 17:21.331
Yeah. Uh, nice to meet you.
And I'll, uh, check you later, Jin.

17:21.331 --> 17:22.666
- Yeah. Later, Trav.
- Cool.

17:28.714 --> 17:29.923
Who is he?

17:29.923 --> 17:32.718
That's Travis.
He's a friend of mine from soccer.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.512
That guy is your friend?

17:35.512 --> 17:37.973
He kind of likes to mess with people,
as you can see.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.601
He got into this whole thing
with my buddy Anuj over the summer.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.853
Anuj is still kind of messed up about it, honestly.

17:44.938 --> 17:48.025
Hey! What are you laughing at?

17:48.025 --> 17:50.986
Uh, well, hey, uh. Please--
Please don't-- don't-- don't do that.

17:50.986 --> 17:54.281
- Why? He's being disrespectful.
- Yeah. Yes, but everybody's staring at us.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.784
- Yeah. Good. Let them.
- No, no. Yeah. Please chill.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.411
Yeah.

18:00.454 --> 18:01.497
Thanks.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.629
You're kind of, like,
a confident dude, huh?

18:09.546 --> 18:10.756
"Confident dude"?

18:11.423 --> 18:13.926
Yeah, like,
you don't ever really doubt yourself.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.345
Why would I doubt myself?

18:18.013 --> 18:21.350
Okay. You can show me the book now,
if you want.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.186
Oh, yeah. Oh, but it's not a book.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.063
It's...

18:26.939 --> 18:28.357
It's this.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.819
Come with me.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.489
- Cool, right?
- Yeah.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.783
Just, it doesn't look like Kugo Ren.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.245
In book four,
he learns the 72 transformations.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.207
So, wai-- Where'd you get this?

18:45.207 --> 18:46.834
Oh, my dad gave it to me.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.545
He wants me to stay at home
and work for him,

18:50.129 --> 18:52.297
but I want something different.

18:53.382 --> 18:57.177
So, like, your dad wasn't cool
with you coming here?

18:57.761 --> 19:00.013
No, my dad's never cool.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.641
He's like a burning fire.

19:06.270 --> 19:07.354
Okay.

19:07.354 --> 19:10.732
Uh, yeah.
My dad's kind of the opposite of that.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.943
He's just sort of stressed and tired
all the time.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.863
Last night he got into a fight with my mom
about "fried squid,"

19:15.863 --> 19:18.490
which was pretty pathetic.

19:23.996 --> 19:27.583
Hey, Jin, I think you should
go ask that girl out for a date.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.169
I should w-- Sorry, what?

19:30.169 --> 19:32.212
The American girl you were looking at.

19:32.212 --> 19:34.590
Okay, yeah.
Uh, that's what I thought you said.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.134
No, that's not a good idea.
That's-- That's--

19:37.134 --> 19:38.385
Why not?

19:38.886 --> 19:41.430
Be a "confident dude" like me.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.974
Huh? Come on.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.309
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.894
Here.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.150
<i>What could go Wong?</i>

19:54.109 --> 19:56.570
This is so good.

19:56.570 --> 19:57.738
Stop. Stop.

19:57.738 --> 19:58.864
What?

19:59.615 --> 20:01.491
I think it's, like, problematic.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.203
No! It's ironic.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.496
It's-- It's ironic, right?

20:06.496 --> 20:09.208
Yeah. Uh, yeah, it's--

20:11.084 --> 20:12.252
Yeah, I-- Yeah.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.420
Yeah.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.553
- Hey, Mom?
- Hmm?

20:22.054 --> 20:24.139
Do you think
we could go waterskiing someday?

20:24.139 --> 20:26.475
You don't want to do that.

20:26.475 --> 20:30.103
I-- I... [chuckles] ...think I do, right?
'Cause I just asked you.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.731
We went skiing once. You hated it.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.566
You fell in the snow and cried.

20:34.566 --> 20:38.153
No. Mom, waterskiing, like,
you do it on a lake with a boat.

20:38.153 --> 20:42.532
<i>Aiya</i>,
we are not water ski people, Jin.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.868
What's that mean, Mom?

20:46.536 --> 20:48.538
Ask Daddy tonight if he's home.

20:48.538 --> 20:51.375
He may be late, though.
He's supposed to talk to his boss.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.876
What's he talking to him about?

20:52.876 --> 20:55.420
Daddy has worked at the company
for a long time,

20:55.420 --> 20:58.840
but he's been in the same level now
for many years.

20:59.466 --> 21:02.886
I want him to speak up,
but it's not so easy.

21:04.638 --> 21:05.931
Why not?

21:06.640 --> 21:09.017
Because we are not water ski people, Jin.

21:20.153 --> 21:22.864
Bull Demon is planning
to attack during the Autumn Equinox.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.284
His uprising is building strength.

21:26.159 --> 21:28.120
This isn't political. It's personal.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.831
We all know
he wants revenge against Wukong.

21:31.623 --> 21:35.877
Whatever his reason, we won't stand
a chance against him without the staff.

21:36.378 --> 21:38.839
Why would Wei-Chen steal
from his own family?

21:39.965 --> 21:41.550
He is my son.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.635
I'll find him.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.989
You know, in Taiwan,
people love this. It's good for you.

22:05.532 --> 22:06.616
Right.

22:07.409 --> 22:08.994
Can you explain to me
how it's good for you?

22:08.994 --> 22:11.538
'Cause, it's literally--
It's skin and toenails.

22:11.538 --> 22:15.000
Sometimes the things
you hate are the things you need.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.585
Eat it. It's good for you.

22:17.419 --> 22:20.380
Right. But this one
looks like it's giving me the thumbs-up.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.758
Want me to put it
in the hot dog bun?

22:22.758 --> 22:25.886
- A little ketchup? Some ice cream?
- Y-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.846
Yummy.

22:31.725 --> 22:32.726
So...

22:34.186 --> 22:37.105
Jin, how was school?

22:37.105 --> 22:39.399
Uh, it was good. School was-was fine.

22:39.399 --> 22:43.153
Um, I've got American Lit, Bio 2, Trig,

22:43.153 --> 22:46.865
uh, World History,
which I think is way too broad. Art.

22:46.865 --> 22:50.744
And I-I-I also have PE this year
which I can sub for a sport,

22:50.744 --> 22:53.246
so, I was thinking,
maybe I could do soccer.

22:54.373 --> 22:57.751
Not too many activities, hmm?
Just stay focused.

22:57.751 --> 23:00.504
Study, work hard. That is enough.

23:01.838 --> 23:03.298
Sometimes...

23:05.300 --> 23:06.551
What?

23:07.052 --> 23:08.804
Sometimes that's enough.

23:08.804 --> 23:12.015
Sometimes you gotta speak up
so that people notice you.

23:14.142 --> 23:18.647
Sometimes the best way to get people
to notice you is to work hard, hmm?

23:18.647 --> 23:20.982
And sometimes people treat you
like an animal.

23:20.982 --> 23:22.526
Like a little monkey.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.792
Did you know that there's a kind of monkey
that-- It knows if it's gonna rain?

23:40.210 --> 23:41.753
It's called a Burmese sneezing monkey.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.463
- We learned about it in school today.
- Jin. Jin.

23:43.463 --> 23:46.049
It's got a big nose,
so the condensation collects

23:46.049 --> 23:49.386
and irritates its, uh, follicles.

23:52.472 --> 23:56.143
<i>In entertainment news,

Well, Freddy, looks like

24:53.658 --> 24:55.869
Maytag?

24:57.704 --> 24:59.789
It's just an expression.
It means that it's dead.

24:59.789 --> 25:01.625
I'll order you a new fridge tomorrow.

25:02.292 --> 25:05.837
Gosh, I never knew taking over
this building would be so much work

25:05.837 --> 25:08.048
when I inherited it
from old Mr. Henderson.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.050
Ah, yes.

25:10.050 --> 25:12.886
Old Mr. Henderson, rest in peace.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.721
He have gone to meet his Maytag.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.350
You'll get the hang of it eventually.

25:18.850 --> 25:19.851
Hey, by the way,

25:19.851 --> 25:23.188
do you think that your neighbor Lindsay
might need repairs too?

25:24.022 --> 25:27.317
Ooh, Danny.
Danny, are you in love with Lindsay?

25:27.317 --> 25:30.028
What? No.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.989
Okay, fine. Maybe I'm interested.

25:32.989 --> 25:34.950
But... [sighs] ...I have no chance.

25:34.950 --> 25:39.120
Just go for it. As my wise ancestor say,
"What could go Wong?"

25:43.583 --> 25:45.835
You know what? Maybe I'll fix
that ceiling fan while I'm here.

26:29.796 --> 26:31.590
- Hey, Amelia.
- Oh, hey.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.467
Um, I was wondering,
would you be interested

26:34.467 --> 26:36.344
in, like, maybe hanging out sometime?

26:37.137 --> 26:39.055
- Uh...
- Jin! Jin!

26:40.015 --> 26:42.601
Look, we are twins.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.733
Oh, s-sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.818
- Yeah. Yeah. Go.
- Uh, you're not. It's fine.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.487
Listen, uh, forget I said anything--

26:54.487 --> 26:56.781
No, it was--
It was really sweet of you to ask.

26:56.781 --> 26:59.701
Uh, maybe we could hang out.
Just, like, as buds, you know?

27:02.037 --> 27:03.204
Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

27:03.204 --> 27:05.707
Sorry, that was-- That was really lame.

27:05.707 --> 27:08.418
Uh, it's good. It's all good.
Buds is cool. Buds is--

27:08.418 --> 27:10.670
So, I guess I'll, uh--
I'll see you later then?

27:11.838 --> 27:13.131
Yeah. See you.

27:19.596 --> 27:21.473
Jin, are you okay?

27:24.142 --> 27:25.685
- I gotta get to class.
- Yeah, we should go.

27:25.685 --> 27:27.979
- No, don't follow me.
- But I'm your shadow.

27:27.979 --> 27:30.231
No, you're not.
You're not my shadow. You're not my twin.

27:30.231 --> 27:33.109
You're not my friend, okay?
So, please just leave me alone.

27:33.109 --> 27:34.653
Jin, wait.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.702
- Whoa!
- Somebody help him.

27:42.702 --> 27:45.080
Jin! Jin! Jin, are you okay?

28:09.729 --> 28:10.772
Hey, Anuj.

28:12.607 --> 28:13.650
Hey.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.485
How's it going?

28:16.194 --> 28:17.404
Fine.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.155
Cool. Uh...

28:20.824 --> 28:23.993
That's, uh, cool Rebel Hatsuko makeup.

28:25.078 --> 28:28.581
Just, um, exploratory stuff that'll--
It'll get better.

28:28.581 --> 28:29.833
For sure.

28:31.167 --> 28:32.210
Hey, uh, did you know

28:32.210 --> 28:34.754
there's actually seven <i>Kugo Ren Saga</i> books
instead of three?

28:36.172 --> 28:38.466
Good to know. Thanks for the update.

28:40.093 --> 28:42.887
So, what's the plan, dude?
You're just gonna never talk to me again?

28:42.887 --> 28:45.849
Because Travis made fun of you,
like, two months ago?

28:46.433 --> 28:47.517
Okay.

28:48.059 --> 28:51.187
Listen, you can't just show up
to my club soccer game dressed as Naruto

28:51.187 --> 28:53.690
and do a bunch of <i>jutsus</i>
and expect everyone to be like,

28:53.690 --> 28:55.525
"Oh, that's normal."

28:57.193 --> 29:02.198
Well, I'm sorry if I embarrassed you
in front of your new, cool soccer bros.

29:03.032 --> 29:07.746
Why are you even mad at me? Right?
'Cause I didn't do anything.

29:09.372 --> 29:11.249
That's right, you didn't.

29:11.249 --> 29:14.127
You just stood there and let it happen.
Maybe you should've done something.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.421
Okay, and maybe you should learn
to take a joke.

29:18.757 --> 29:21.176
Have you seen that meme
that's been going around?

29:21.176 --> 29:23.553
The one with the guy from the old TV show?

29:23.553 --> 29:24.929
Yeah. Why?

29:25.597 --> 29:27.015
Well, there's a new one.

29:33.396 --> 29:36.399
<i>What could go Wong?</i>

29:37.734 --> 29:38.943
Who made that?

29:41.237 --> 29:42.447
Hey, who made that?

29:47.702 --> 29:51.122
Welcome to JV soccer tryouts.

29:51.122 --> 29:53.333
My name is Coach Garrett.

29:53.333 --> 29:57.754
We're starting with the speed drills,
so make sure you're warmed up and ready.

29:57.754 --> 29:58.922
Glad you made it.

29:58.922 --> 30:00.298
Thanks. Yeah, we'll see.

30:00.298 --> 30:01.549
You got this, dude.

30:02.717 --> 30:03.885
Hey, Jin.

30:03.885 --> 30:05.011
Hey, what's up?

30:05.553 --> 30:07.013
Hey, where's your new buddy?

30:07.013 --> 30:08.765
That was just
something I had to do yesterday.

30:08.765 --> 30:11.059
That was pretty cool of you
to have lunch with him though.

30:11.684 --> 30:13.645
Just glad
I don't have to deal with it anymore.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.272
Why? What could go Wong?

30:18.483 --> 30:19.734
Okay.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.653
"Win the ball."

30:21.653 --> 30:23.488
Here's how this works.

30:23.488 --> 30:27.700
Two guys on each side of the pitch,
ball is in the center.

30:27.700 --> 30:33.957
On my signal, you sprint and try to--
you guessed it-- win the ball.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.125
Who's first?

30:36.709 --> 30:38.002
I'll go.

30:38.002 --> 30:39.712
Very good, Travis.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.422
Who else?

30:42.757 --> 30:44.717
- I'll go.
- Great, what's your name?

30:45.635 --> 30:46.636
Jin.

30:46.636 --> 30:51.307
Okay. Travis versus Jim. Line it up!

30:54.686 --> 30:58.356
Here we go. Ready. Set.

31:21.504 --> 31:22.964
It's good for you.

31:25.675 --> 31:27.510
Be a confident dude.

31:36.686 --> 31:38.897
You okay, man? That was pretty gnarly.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.816
Point of the drill is to win the ball,
not take the guy's head off.

31:41.816 --> 31:43.526
Yeah, man. What the hell was that about?

31:43.526 --> 31:45.236
You know exactly what that was about.

31:45.236 --> 31:47.322
You're not laughing now, right?
At least do it to my face!

31:47.322 --> 31:50.199
- Easy there, Jim.
- Jin! My name is Jin!

31:50.199 --> 31:53.494
Listen, this is not how we roll
on this team, Son.

31:53.494 --> 31:56.414
Now, I think you may wanna consider
another activity.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.250
Just cool off. Take a walk.

32:07.091 --> 32:09.177
Whoa! Whoa!

32:10.303 --> 32:11.304
Wow.

32:11.804 --> 32:13.765
Coach.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.809
Right. Right. Sorry. Come on.
Let's get you to the nurse's office.

32:23.566 --> 32:24.817
Hey, Jin.

32:25.401 --> 32:26.444
Hey.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.288
Hey, um...

32:38.957 --> 32:40.917
I'm really sorry about earlier.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.544
And all that crap I said.

32:43.544 --> 32:45.546
It's stupid.

32:46.798 --> 32:50.426
I swear I'm not that guy, you know.
Or, at least, I don't wanna be,

32:50.426 --> 32:55.264
and honestly, maybe that's the problem,
is that I don't know what guy I am.

33:03.731 --> 33:04.816
What were you watching?

33:07.276 --> 33:08.778
Oh, uh... S--

33:09.612 --> 33:14.826
Someone took a video of me and you earlier
and they posted it on this dumb app.

33:15.785 --> 33:16.953
Can I see?

33:16.953 --> 33:18.162
Yeah, sure.

33:20.289 --> 33:22.333
Pretty sure it was Travis.

33:22.333 --> 33:25.420
<i>What could go Wong?</i>

33:33.302 --> 33:34.512
Not Travis.

33:38.516 --> 33:41.019
Greg?

33:43.187 --> 33:48.484
Oh, uh. That's my mom.
So, I guess I'll see you later.

33:48.484 --> 33:49.777
Fried squid.

33:50.611 --> 33:52.530
- Sorry, what?
- Fried squid.

33:53.698 --> 33:56.576
In Chinese, it means
"getting fired from your job."

35:03.142 --> 35:06.229
You'll need a better
disguise than that to hide from me.

35:07.647 --> 35:10.525
What are you doing here?

35:11.442 --> 35:13.194
I'm searching for the Fourth Scroll.

35:13.194 --> 35:15.404
Are you serious?

35:16.864 --> 35:20.034
The Fourth Scroll is a myth.

35:20.868 --> 35:21.869
No.

35:22.578 --> 35:23.746
It's real.

35:24.705 --> 35:29.085
I brought back the sutras.
There were three scrolls, not four.

35:29.669 --> 35:30.753
You're wrong.

35:31.420 --> 35:32.713
How do you know?

35:35.758 --> 35:36.759
I had a dream.

35:39.887 --> 35:41.806
A dream!

35:41.806 --> 35:43.975
Why can't you listen to me for once?

35:45.393 --> 35:49.063
I don't have time for this.

35:49.063 --> 35:51.440
Have you forgotten
about the uprising back home?

35:52.150 --> 35:54.235
You're a child living in a fantasy.

35:54.944 --> 35:58.114
And you're too weak to carry my staff.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.243
Give it back.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.328
I'm taking you home now.

36:08.416 --> 36:09.417
No.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.547
- You think you know everything?
- I didn't say that!

36:56.547 --> 36:58.883
Why don't you get a job then?

37:21.656 --> 37:25.910
Why don't you speak up like this at work?

37:25.910 --> 37:28.037
Then they wouldn't walk all over you.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.819
Don't you remember who you used to be?

37:59.819 --> 38:04.740
We came here with nothing,
with no connections.

38:04.740 --> 38:07.076
Where did that brave man go?

38:09.537 --> 38:10.997
We were young.

38:11.622 --> 38:13.374
It's different now.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.209
One of us needs to live in reality.

38:15.209 --> 38:17.086
And I don't live in reality?

38:40.067 --> 38:41.902
I fight for this family
just as much as you do!

38:41.902 --> 38:43.738
Calm down!

38:43.738 --> 38:44.822
Stop!

39:15.686 --> 39:17.980
Wukong.

39:18.981 --> 39:21.108
I haven't seen you act like this
in a long time.

39:21.609 --> 39:25.738
Leave the boy alone.
He has his own journey.

39:25.738 --> 39:29.158
With respect, Guanyin.

39:29.950 --> 39:32.536
He is my son.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.289
Clearly.

40:01.440 --> 40:02.650
Don't let anyone find it.

40:03.692 --> 40:06.946
They will come for him.
