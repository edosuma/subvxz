WEBVTT

00:04.679 --> 00:06.804
Previously,
on Homeland...

00:06.887 --> 00:08.363
We have to buy time,
40 minutes, maybe an hour,

00:08.387 --> 00:09.762
till they're in the air.

00:09.845 --> 00:11.154
- I'm not leaving you.
- I agreed with Saul.

00:11.178 --> 00:12.618
If things go wrong,
this is the plan.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.237
What, to allow them
to fucking catch you?

00:15.720 --> 00:18.178
speaking foreign language

00:26.095 --> 00:27.553
It was you.

00:30.178 --> 00:32.804
Carrie Mathison, you're just
going to leave her here?

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:42.220 --> 00:45.303
Ms. Martin, what was
your most recent operation?

00:45.387 --> 00:47.428
We tried to compromise
your president

00:47.512 --> 00:50.178
and push her out of office.

00:57.428 --> 00:59.053
Your medication.

00:59.136 --> 01:02.053
How do you wanna spend
the rest of your days here?

01:02.136 --> 01:04.428
Reading nice books
that Alexander brings you

01:04.512 --> 01:07.470
and exercising in the yard...

01:07.553 --> 01:11.387
or going mad,
locked up in an asylum?

01:11.470 --> 01:12.929
No one back in Moscow

01:13.011 --> 01:14.845
is much in the mood
to negotiate, anyway.

01:14.929 --> 01:17.428
Maybe it's better
if you wait a few months.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.053
I can't wait a few months.

01:19.136 --> 01:21.387
I don't even know if she'll be
alive in a few months.

01:24.136 --> 01:25.595
Go.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.261
You all right?
You all right?

02:00.887 --> 02:03.220
No, no, no, no.
Not the coat.

02:03.303 --> 02:05.011
No, no, no, no, no.
Not the coat.

02:05.095 --> 02:07.387
Not the coat.
Not the coat.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.529
Don't be scared.

02:14.553 --> 02:15.887
Don't be scared.

02:25.136 --> 02:27.053
No, no, no, no!

03:06.804 --> 03:08.053
Rough ride?

03:09.887 --> 03:11.512
You need to sleep.

03:11.595 --> 03:13.303
I'm trying.

03:13.387 --> 03:15.178
It's been almost six hours.

03:15.261 --> 03:18.136
You can have another lorazepam.

03:18.220 --> 03:20.387
No, I wanna wean myself.

03:29.053 --> 03:30.387
Maybe a half.

04:00.428 --> 04:01.553
Blood work?

04:01.637 --> 04:03.512
Tomorrow.

04:16.803 --> 04:18.220
Sorry.

04:18.303 --> 04:21.595
No, come on in.
Have a seat.

04:21.678 --> 04:22.720
Is Doug...

04:22.804 --> 04:23.863
I'm sitting in for Doug.

04:23.887 --> 04:25.929
Jim Turrow.

04:33.970 --> 04:36.011
You're his supervisor.
Is that right?

04:36.095 --> 04:37.387
You want anything to drink?

04:37.470 --> 04:39.178
Uh, no.
No, I'm good.

04:39.261 --> 04:40.637
Okay if I ask you
a few questions?

04:40.720 --> 04:43.095
Sure.

04:43.178 --> 04:45.553
You were detained in Russia
for 213 days?

04:45.637 --> 04:47.428
Yes.

04:47.512 --> 04:49.679
And you were interrogated
for the first...

04:49.762 --> 04:52.679
Uh, 30ish...

04:52.762 --> 04:54.136
Who was your interrogator?

04:55.220 --> 04:57.679
Um, a colonel named
Sergei Tobokov,

04:57.762 --> 04:58.887
most of the time, anyway.

04:58.970 --> 05:00.011
GRU.

05:00.095 --> 05:01.970
Why'd he stop?

05:02.053 --> 05:03.720
All of this is in the file.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.303
It's a big file.

05:05.387 --> 05:07.029
Can you tell me why
he stopped interrogating you?

05:10.011 --> 05:12.845
I think because
I threw my feces at him.

05:12.929 --> 05:14.845
And was that strategic?

05:14.929 --> 05:16.428
No, no.

05:16.512 --> 05:19.970
I... I... I was in the midst
of a florid psychosis.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.679
They withheld my medication

05:21.762 --> 05:25.345
and it took about 20 days
for me to devolve

05:25.428 --> 05:28.303
into a not
very helpful subject, um,

05:28.387 --> 05:30.303
but they kept at it
for another week or so.

05:30.387 --> 05:32.929
I can't give you
an exact figure.

05:33.011 --> 05:35.720
After that,
it's all either blank

05:35.804 --> 05:37.929
or a series of images

05:38.011 --> 05:40.345
that don't much comport
with reality.

05:40.428 --> 05:42.303
Um, if we're doing this
the slow way,

05:42.387 --> 05:44.345
may... maybe I will take
some water.

05:44.428 --> 05:47.470
Doug informs me you'd like
to be reinstated at the agency.

05:47.553 --> 05:49.178
Yes.

05:49.261 --> 05:50.887
Yes,
I would like that very much.

05:50.970 --> 05:52.970
A security clearance
isn't an option

05:53.053 --> 05:55.303
with upwards of 180 days
unaccounted for.

05:55.387 --> 05:56.845
Yeah, I know that.

05:56.929 --> 05:58.196
That's why I've been
working so hard

05:58.220 --> 05:59.679
with Dr. Foley and Doug,

05:59.762 --> 06:01.970
just trying
to fill in the gaps.

06:02.053 --> 06:02.845
Did they give you
the impression

06:02.929 --> 06:03.845
that wasn't the case?

06:03.929 --> 06:05.303
No.

06:05.387 --> 06:07.107
Did they tell you
you failed your polygraph?

06:08.887 --> 06:11.095
Deception indicated.

06:11.178 --> 06:13.553
So you're gonna have
to bear with me.

06:16.261 --> 06:18.970
Um... which questions?

06:19.053 --> 06:22.178
You said it was usually Tobokov
but not always.

06:22.261 --> 06:24.387
I'd like to know
which questions, please.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.720
Quite a few, actually.

06:28.637 --> 06:30.136
Such as?

06:30.220 --> 06:31.595
Have you ever conspired

06:31.679 --> 06:33.929
with a foreign intelligence
officer or service?

06:43.470 --> 06:45.345
Wh... so... so what does that mean?

06:45.428 --> 06:48.762
Are... are you accusing me
of something?

06:48.845 --> 06:50.261
Could mean a lot of things:

06:50.345 --> 06:52.261
giving up sources
and methods,

06:52.345 --> 06:54.053
working for the enemy.

06:54.136 --> 06:55.553
You tell me.

06:57.679 --> 07:00.053
My memory doesn't distinguish
between what was real

07:00.136 --> 07:01.679
and... and what wasn't.

07:01.762 --> 07:03.178
You get that, right?

07:03.261 --> 07:05.679
The polygraph doesn't care
if you were delusional.

07:05.762 --> 07:07.261
It says you were lying.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.261
I edit my answers,
because I don't trust

07:10.345 --> 07:11.345
my own brain.

07:11.387 --> 07:12.762
That's what it's picking up.

07:12.845 --> 07:14.804
Maybe.

07:14.887 --> 07:16.387
We expected that
going into this.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.970
Dr. Foley and Doug both said
it was a possibility.

07:25.887 --> 07:27.762
Why is he acting like
this is incriminating?

07:27.845 --> 07:30.428
We expected it.

07:30.512 --> 07:32.072
You wanna jump in here?

07:32.136 --> 07:33.887
Sit down, please.

07:45.345 --> 07:48.011
You did admit to giving up
the location

07:48.095 --> 07:49.845
of a safe house in Beirut.

07:49.929 --> 07:52.762
Yeah, one that hasn't been
active for decades.

07:52.845 --> 07:54.095
I believe at that point

07:54.178 --> 07:56.512
I had been kept awake
for 96 hours.

07:56.595 --> 07:59.470
- What about assets?
- What about them?

07:59.553 --> 08:01.154
Did you ever reveal
the identity of an asset?

08:01.178 --> 08:02.470
No.

08:02.553 --> 08:04.553
Maybe somebody who died
ten years before.

08:04.637 --> 08:06.762
No, assets have families.
I wouldn't do that.

08:06.845 --> 08:09.095
You sure?

08:09.178 --> 08:10.929
How much more clearly
can I say this?

08:11.011 --> 08:13.261
I did not.

08:13.345 --> 08:16.720
Ms. Mathison,
how can you be so sure

08:16.804 --> 08:18.428
if there's 180 days
of your life

08:18.512 --> 08:20.011
you don't remember?

08:36.761 --> 08:38.220
Sorry to keep you waiting.

08:38.303 --> 08:40.511
Parties are prepared
to work through dinner tonight.

08:40.595 --> 08:41.986
Should we take that
as a positive sign?

08:42.010 --> 08:43.886
Just getting the Taliban
to the table

08:43.970 --> 08:45.428
has taken nine years.

08:45.512 --> 08:46.613
So the fact
they're sitting down

08:46.637 --> 08:48.517
with the Afghan government
at all is a positive.

08:48.595 --> 08:51.512
Come on, Saul, make some news.
It's been three weeks.

08:51.595 --> 08:54.512
At least give us a sense
of how it's going so far.

08:54.595 --> 08:56.136
It's going;
from what I understand,

08:56.220 --> 08:58.053
there's a nice lamb kabsa
on the menu tonight.

08:58.136 --> 08:59.595
- Ha.
- Okay.

08:59.679 --> 09:00.879
How 'bout off the record then?

09:03.053 --> 09:04.220
Sure.

09:07.095 --> 09:08.895
Well, the list
of missed opportunities

09:08.970 --> 09:10.637
for peace in Afghanistan
is long.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.887
What do you see as the main
obstacles to a deal?

09:12.970 --> 09:15.220
Well, for one thing,
America hasn't got

09:15.303 --> 09:17.220
a whole lot of good options.

09:17.303 --> 09:19.136
We're not staying forever.

09:19.220 --> 09:21.553
President's made that
abundantly clear.

09:21.637 --> 09:22.877
We can't just walk away either.

09:22.929 --> 09:25.345
Why not?

09:25.428 --> 09:27.108
Well, our forces out past
a critical point,

09:27.178 --> 09:28.679
Kabul falls in six weeks.

09:28.762 --> 09:31.762
General Edwards
told me six months.

09:31.845 --> 09:34.387
Trillion dollars spent,

09:34.470 --> 09:38.178
more than 2,000 lives lost...

09:38.261 --> 09:40.595
it's a U.S. surrender
any way you look at it.

09:42.220 --> 09:43.720
Other issue is
the Taliban itself.

09:43.804 --> 09:45.321
It's not clear they have
anything to gain

09:45.345 --> 09:46.679
by a political settlement.

09:46.762 --> 09:48.553
What do you mean, exactly?

09:48.637 --> 09:51.136
Only reason to cut a deal
is to get us to leave

09:51.220 --> 09:52.345
sooner than later.

09:52.428 --> 09:53.828
Which you just said
isn't an option.

09:53.887 --> 09:55.887
Not without serious
security guarantees in place

09:56.011 --> 09:57.011
before we go.

09:57.095 --> 09:58.387
And what's wrong with that?

09:58.470 --> 09:59.946
Nothing, if you think
the Taliban will abide

09:59.970 --> 10:01.130
by the terms of an agreement.

10:01.178 --> 10:02.345
And will they?

10:02.428 --> 10:05.053
Your guess is as good as mine.

10:05.136 --> 10:06.720
President Warner
seems confident enough.

10:06.804 --> 10:08.595
Well, the President's
an optimist.

10:08.679 --> 10:09.929
Me, I'm a spy.

10:10.011 --> 10:12.595
And his
National Security Advisor.

10:12.679 --> 10:13.720
Don't remind me.

10:14.970 --> 10:16.529
G'ulom's making a statement.

10:16.553 --> 10:18.637
Sorry, I gotta go.
More later.

10:22.220 --> 10:24.553
What's he gonna say?
Do we know?

10:24.637 --> 10:25.887
No idea.

10:25.970 --> 10:27.428
His office only just announced

10:27.512 --> 10:29.178
that he was doing
the press conference.

10:29.261 --> 10:30.929
This can't be good.

10:33.261 --> 10:36.804
But we are
lions, brothers and sisters.

10:38.345 --> 10:41.679
Other animals in the jungle
are afraid

10:41.762 --> 10:46.053
of even a sick lion
and stay away from him.

10:46.136 --> 10:50.011
We are lions.

10:50.095 --> 10:54.011
The United States
should treat us

10:54.095 --> 10:56.762
as lions.

10:56.845 --> 11:00.178
And we demand nothing less.

11:01.303 --> 11:05.303
Instead, our president

11:05.387 --> 11:09.136
and foreign minister
have been tricked.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.387
Tricked into promising
to release

11:13.470 --> 11:16.553
more than 1,000

11:16.637 --> 11:20.387
Taliban prisoners of war,

11:20.470 --> 11:24.387
12 of them responsible
for the bomb...

11:25.470 --> 11:29.428
hidden inside an ambulance

11:29.512 --> 11:31.470
and killed nearly

11:31.553 --> 11:35.845
100 citizens last month

11:35.929 --> 11:37.720
in Kabul.

11:39.970 --> 11:43.512
I want you to know...

11:43.595 --> 11:47.804
I am in charge of these
prisoners,

11:47.887 --> 11:51.720
and I will never agree
to their release.

11:51.804 --> 11:54.053
Never.

11:54.136 --> 11:58.387
Not even a single one.

12:18.762 --> 12:20.303
Robin, talk to me.

12:20.387 --> 12:21.720
Phones started going off,

12:21.804 --> 12:23.237
and you can imagine
what happened next.

12:23.261 --> 12:24.762
Where's Agha Jan?

12:24.845 --> 12:26.279
He threw down his credentials
and he stormed off

12:26.303 --> 12:28.595
with the rest
of the Taliban delegation.

12:28.679 --> 12:30.178
I don't think
he's coming back, Saul.

12:30.261 --> 12:31.529
- I really don't.
- Which way they go?

12:31.553 --> 12:32.679
Um...

12:41.387 --> 12:43.553
Agha Jan.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.011
Agha Jan!

12:45.095 --> 12:48.053
We told you,
no prisoners, no talks.

12:48.136 --> 12:49.387
I'm aware.

12:49.470 --> 12:51.220
The very first thing
we agreed to

12:51.303 --> 12:52.553
and now it is broken.

12:52.637 --> 12:54.845
I understand you're angry.

12:54.929 --> 12:57.720
I'm angry,
but nothing is broken.

12:57.804 --> 12:59.720
We agreed
to a prisoner exchange

12:59.804 --> 13:01.720
upon successful completion
of an agreement.

13:01.804 --> 13:03.720
We are not there yet,
not even close.

13:03.804 --> 13:05.053
You heard G'ulom.

13:05.136 --> 13:06.946
Vice President doesn't speak
for the government.

13:06.970 --> 13:08.387
You know that.

13:08.470 --> 13:10.261
What is done is done.

13:10.345 --> 13:11.637
Too bad.

13:12.595 --> 13:13.887
Agha Jan.

13:15.720 --> 13:16.738
Leave now
and it'll be years before

13:16.762 --> 13:18.220
we get back to this point,
if ever.

13:19.470 --> 13:20.887
I'm sorry, I truly am.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.053
I have an idea.

13:25.136 --> 13:26.887
What if I was able
to accelerate the release

13:26.970 --> 13:28.637
of some of the prisoners
in U.S. custody?

13:28.720 --> 13:30.595
Say, 5 of the 32 at Guantanamo?

13:30.679 --> 13:32.929
Would that change your mind?

13:33.011 --> 13:34.804
You could do that?

13:34.887 --> 13:36.845
I could try.

13:36.929 --> 13:40.011
I would consider it
if we get to choose which five.

13:41.220 --> 13:42.679
Okay.

13:42.762 --> 13:46.053
Then we'll stay
for one week,

13:46.136 --> 13:49.845
but you still have to get
G'ulom to change what he said.

13:58.970 --> 14:00.428
speaks foreign language

14:05.637 --> 14:07.053
I'll call you back
from the office.

14:08.637 --> 14:10.178
Give us a minute, will you?

14:10.261 --> 14:11.970
Of course.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.428
You look peeved.
What's happened?

14:16.512 --> 14:18.011
You know damn well.

14:18.095 --> 14:19.470
I warned you.

14:19.553 --> 14:22.220
It was only a matter of time
before things fell apart.

14:22.303 --> 14:23.720
There's falling apart

14:23.804 --> 14:26.011
and then there's pushing 'em
off a cliff.

14:26.887 --> 14:29.512
Pakistan had nothing to do
with this.

14:29.595 --> 14:32.220
We're not leaking details
of these talks to anyone.

14:32.303 --> 14:34.095
Please.

14:34.178 --> 14:38.762
It wasn't me, and it wasn't
anybody in my delegation.

14:40.178 --> 14:41.738
You know, you almost
make me believe you.

14:41.762 --> 14:44.845
Then I remember Islamabad,
the embassy,

14:44.929 --> 14:47.887
the two hours you stood down
your response team,

14:48.011 --> 14:51.845
while 36 Americans were killed
in cold blood.

14:58.762 --> 15:00.387
Colonel Jefrani.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.011
Yes, ma'am?

15:06.095 --> 15:08.220
Show Mr. Berenson out.

16:21.762 --> 16:23.011
You got a lot of shit.

16:24.428 --> 16:25.595
I'm Gonzales.

16:25.679 --> 16:26.762
Piotrowski.

16:26.845 --> 16:28.095
Huh?

16:28.178 --> 16:30.929
Piotrowski.
Max!

16:32.303 --> 16:34.011
Squad's out on patrol.

16:34.095 --> 16:35.762
Nobody gonna be back
till morning.

16:35.845 --> 16:38.178
Anything I should do
in the meantime?

16:39.845 --> 16:42.762
Stay low, try not to get shot.

17:02.053 --> 17:03.387
Doug.

17:03.470 --> 17:04.637
Hey.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.136
Jim Turrow,
counterintelligence.

17:06.220 --> 17:07.303
Hi, Jim, good to meet you.

17:07.387 --> 17:08.303
And you know Dr. Foley.

17:08.387 --> 17:09.387
Hi.

17:09.428 --> 17:10.595
Where are we?

17:10.679 --> 17:12.195
Physically,
she's in good shape.

17:12.220 --> 17:14.804
Sleep is still an issue,
but it's better than it was.

17:14.887 --> 17:16.970
Her thyroid hasn't quite
leveled out.

17:17.053 --> 17:18.762
That's from?

17:18.845 --> 17:20.637
The malnutrition.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.470
It improves when she eats more
or treat it with a pill?

17:23.553 --> 17:24.553
Medication.

17:24.595 --> 17:26.011
We're playing with the dosage.

17:26.095 --> 17:27.804
That and the sleep
both have an impact

17:27.887 --> 17:30.136
on mood regulation
and memory access.

17:30.220 --> 17:32.470
So we are hoping
that her recall will improve

17:32.553 --> 17:34.136
as we go.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.071
There are still
significant gaps in her story,

17:36.095 --> 17:38.470
but that's par for the course.

17:38.553 --> 17:40.512
She's recovering
more information every day.

17:40.595 --> 17:42.470
It's not the gaps
I'm concerned about.

17:42.553 --> 17:44.679
If you're worried
about the polygraph,

17:44.762 --> 17:46.202
I would take it
with a grain of salt.

17:46.261 --> 17:48.512
It's not something
we can ignore.

17:48.595 --> 17:50.136
Polygraphs are unreliable.

17:50.220 --> 17:52.637
"Deception indicated"
can mean she's nervous

17:52.720 --> 17:54.512
or lying to herself.

17:54.595 --> 17:57.303
Or it can indicate deception.

17:57.387 --> 18:00.011
We have a long way to go.
This is just one data point.

18:00.095 --> 18:03.595
Look, I... I don't wanna dismiss
your misgivings,

18:03.679 --> 18:05.929
but bringing in Mr. Berenson
may have been premature.

18:06.011 --> 18:07.345
He didn't call me here.

18:08.595 --> 18:11.053
Oh.
I misunderstood.

18:11.136 --> 18:12.929
I'm here because
I need Carrie in Kabul

18:13.011 --> 18:14.095
for a week or two.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.428
- When?
- Right away.

18:20.470 --> 18:22.929
We're making progress here.

18:23.011 --> 18:25.261
Put her in a war zone,
we could be back to square one.

18:25.345 --> 18:28.220
Terms of debriefing timeline
or her mental state?

18:28.303 --> 18:29.595
Both.

18:29.679 --> 18:30.804
She unstable?

18:30.887 --> 18:32.804
Not now.

18:34.095 --> 18:35.929
It's an important mission.

18:37.053 --> 18:38.887
I'm okay with a setback.

18:38.970 --> 18:41.887
We may be dealing with
a compromised officer here.

18:41.970 --> 18:43.679
You know, she has a kid.

18:43.762 --> 18:45.095
Mathison?
Yes.

18:45.178 --> 18:46.887
You know,
she signed away custody

18:46.970 --> 18:49.387
and walked into a bear trap
in the middle of Moscow

18:49.470 --> 18:51.387
to stop an attack
on our presidency.

18:51.470 --> 18:52.970
Yes.

18:53.053 --> 18:54.196
Everyone breaks
under interrogation,

18:54.220 --> 18:55.762
especially
Russian interrogation.

18:55.845 --> 18:57.345
They're good at it.

18:57.428 --> 18:58.929
That's why our sources
were protected

18:59.011 --> 19:00.970
and procedures changed
after she was captured.

19:01.053 --> 19:02.428
It's more complicated
than that.

19:02.512 --> 19:04.428
I'm well aware.

19:06.053 --> 19:08.136
What I wanna know is,

19:08.220 --> 19:11.637
do you have anything
other than a jumpy polygraph?

19:22.261 --> 19:23.637
Hey.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.095
Hey.

19:25.178 --> 19:26.845
How are you?
Color's better.

19:29.011 --> 19:31.345
They're big on fresh air
around here.

19:31.428 --> 19:34.136
It seems my vitamin D level's
not great.

19:34.220 --> 19:35.696
Also, I'm a Russian agent,
apparently.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.178
So I heard.

19:37.261 --> 19:38.553
Ridiculous.

19:38.637 --> 19:41.553
You won't mind, then,
if I pick your brain a bit.

19:41.637 --> 19:43.804
Only if you think it's safe
to be seen talking to me.

19:43.887 --> 19:45.220
I'll take my chances.

19:47.637 --> 19:50.804
Your old friend
Abdul Qarid G'ulom

19:50.887 --> 19:53.095
just fired a broadside
into the peace talks.

19:53.178 --> 19:55.053
Yeah, I saw that.

19:55.136 --> 19:56.720
I need him to
publicly walk back

19:56.804 --> 19:59.428
his comments about the POWs.

19:59.512 --> 20:01.595
Agreeing to their release
is what got the Taliban

20:01.679 --> 20:04.428
to the negotiating table
in the first place.

20:04.512 --> 20:06.595
I assume the ambassador's
already taken a run at him.

20:06.679 --> 20:08.887
And the chief of station,
got exactly nowhere.

20:08.970 --> 20:10.303
Who's the current COS?

20:10.387 --> 20:12.428
Mike Dunne.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.512
What?

20:14.887 --> 20:16.279
You need an alpha to deal
with an alpha.

20:16.303 --> 20:19.303
- Mike's not that.
- No.

20:19.387 --> 20:21.821
All right, give me a few days.
I'll come up with some options.

20:21.845 --> 20:23.679
You don't have a few days.

20:23.762 --> 20:24.905
Putting you on
a military transport

20:24.929 --> 20:27.929
to Kabul tonight.

20:28.011 --> 20:30.387
If you're up for it, that is.

20:30.470 --> 20:33.929
You kidding?
Hell yes.

20:36.470 --> 20:38.929
- Saul...
- Don't thank me yet.

20:39.011 --> 20:40.845
Kabul isn't the place
you knew before.

20:40.929 --> 20:43.470
It's ten times more dangerous
just walking around,

20:43.553 --> 20:45.845
and you'll be without
any of your old assets.

20:47.595 --> 20:49.887
Pulled from the field, huh?

20:49.970 --> 20:51.490
The minute you were
arrested in Moscow.

20:51.553 --> 20:53.053
Everybody?

20:53.136 --> 20:56.261
Ones you reported
to headquarters, at least.

20:56.345 --> 20:58.512
Saul, I report all my assets
to headquarters,

20:58.595 --> 21:01.053
no matter who they are
or how sensitive.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.887
Of course you do.

21:04.970 --> 21:07.637
Come on, let's get you
packed up, ready to go.

21:09.053 --> 21:12.512
Hey, Mike, it's Turrow.

21:12.595 --> 21:14.804
You heard from Saul Berenson
by any chance?

21:14.887 --> 21:16.303
No, what's up?

21:16.387 --> 21:17.696
I could be wrong,

21:17.720 --> 21:18.905
but I think you got
a bad situation

21:18.929 --> 21:19.595
coming your way.

21:19.679 --> 21:20.887
Bad how?

21:20.970 --> 21:22.720
A compromised officer.

21:22.804 --> 21:24.720
Who is it?

21:24.804 --> 21:27.220
Your old boss,
Carrie Mathison.

21:30.637 --> 21:33.553
Piotrowski's doing
hardware maintenance.

21:33.637 --> 21:36.470
We're gonna provide support
so he can repair or replace.

21:37.679 --> 21:39.553
The unit's on Sar Ridge.

21:39.637 --> 21:41.220
We're gonna loop around
north of Decup.

21:41.303 --> 21:42.804
We're going over the six-one?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.762
If the trail's intact,
we'll take it two clicks west.

21:46.845 --> 21:48.325
If the rain last week
washed it out...

21:48.387 --> 21:49.470
What is he, NSA?

21:51.887 --> 21:54.178
We're doing this
for a cable repair guy?

21:57.178 --> 21:58.428
Back me up, Gonzo.

21:58.512 --> 21:59.905
We already know
how this shit goes down.

21:59.929 --> 22:01.136
He's right, LT.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.620
At least tell us
what this is about.

22:06.011 --> 22:07.011
Mission's classified.

22:07.095 --> 22:09.845
- Oh, great.
- Hey.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.512
We leave at 22:00.

22:11.595 --> 22:13.553
Whole thing will be done
under cover of darkness,

22:13.637 --> 22:15.720
which should afford us
a measure of security.

22:15.804 --> 22:17.095
This is bullshit.

22:19.345 --> 22:21.720
Show him where
the riverbed's at.

22:21.804 --> 22:25.929
Okay, look, every time we cross
the six-one, we get hit.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.637
Last couple of times,
we lost a guy.

22:27.720 --> 22:28.970
We'll take it slow

22:29.053 --> 22:30.112
'cause you're not used
to the altitude,

22:30.136 --> 22:31.804
but we're gonna cross
the riverbed

22:31.887 --> 22:34.136
right about here
that's fairly exposed.

22:34.220 --> 22:36.053
You just gotta haul ass
till you get

22:36.136 --> 22:37.011
to the trees
on the other side,

22:37.095 --> 22:39.637
about 25, 30 yards.

22:41.261 --> 22:43.887
So when we get
to the riverbed...

22:43.970 --> 22:45.470
Run.

23:26.303 --> 23:27.553
Can you unlock the window?

23:27.637 --> 23:29.553
They don't open.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.595
speaking foreign language

24:19.929 --> 24:22.428
Thank merciful God.
The cavalry's shown up.

24:22.512 --> 24:24.312
Is it just me or is that
chip on your shoulder

24:24.387 --> 24:26.107
bigger than the last time
we saw each other?

24:26.136 --> 24:28.428
Fuck off.

24:28.512 --> 24:30.220
Hey, I want you
to meet somebody.

24:30.303 --> 24:32.720
This is Jenna Bragg.
Jenna, Carrie Mathison.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.512
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

24:34.595 --> 24:35.780
Jenna's the newest member
of the team.

24:35.804 --> 24:36.946
She's gonna be looking
after you.

24:36.970 --> 24:38.154
Come on, Mike,
you know how I roll.

24:38.178 --> 24:38.804
Don't waste your time.

24:38.887 --> 24:40.303
Not at all.

24:40.387 --> 24:41.446
She wants to do it,
don't you, Jenna?

24:41.470 --> 24:42.679
Happy to.

24:42.762 --> 24:44.387
Any word on the G'ulom meeting?

24:44.470 --> 24:46.178
Set for Friday morning.

24:46.261 --> 24:48.571
I figured you'd want a few days
to see what you could dig up.

24:48.595 --> 24:51.470
Saul told me I could get a look
at the latest 201 file on him.

24:51.553 --> 24:53.345
Loaded onto the laptop
in your room,

24:53.428 --> 24:55.148
and if you need anything
run down, just ask.

24:55.178 --> 24:56.970
Thanks.

24:59.679 --> 25:02.178
Glad you're here, Carrie.
I mean that.

25:02.261 --> 25:04.095
Glad to be here.

25:04.178 --> 25:05.321
I'll show you to your room.

25:05.345 --> 25:08.220
Hey, Carrie, um, truth is,

25:08.303 --> 25:09.943
she's a little stuck
in the starting gate.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.720
I've only been here a month.

25:39.804 --> 25:41.553
Sorry?

25:41.637 --> 25:43.720
How am I supposed to get
out of the starting gate

25:43.804 --> 25:45.470
if he won't let me leave
the station

25:45.553 --> 25:48.428
without an armored vehicle
and a security detail?

25:50.637 --> 25:53.553
I might as well have
"CIA" tattooed on my forehead.

25:56.428 --> 25:58.345
How bad is it out there?

25:58.428 --> 26:01.011
It's bad and getting worse.

26:01.095 --> 26:02.720
Foreign workers are
definitely a target,

26:02.804 --> 26:04.845
but isn't this exactly
what I was trained for?

26:08.887 --> 26:10.762
Here.

26:13.095 --> 26:15.720
- Insist, then.
- Excuse me.

26:15.804 --> 26:17.762
You're in a hard place,
trying to do hard things.

26:17.845 --> 26:19.565
Don't whine and don't take no
for an answer.

26:42.095 --> 26:43.095
Who's it to?

26:43.178 --> 26:45.136
Berenson.

26:46.679 --> 26:47.696
What makes you think
she's gonna have

26:47.720 --> 26:49.720
any more luck with G'ulom
than we did?

26:49.804 --> 26:51.387
G'ulom trusts her.

26:51.470 --> 26:52.780
The two of them made
a pretty good partnership

26:52.804 --> 26:53.929
back in the day.

26:54.011 --> 26:55.887
Killed a lot of bad guys
together.

26:57.178 --> 26:58.470
Shh.

27:07.011 --> 27:08.053
What's that?

27:08.136 --> 27:09.679
A call code...

27:09.762 --> 27:11.595
prearranged between asset
and base.

27:11.679 --> 27:13.053
Two pings for this,
three for that.

27:13.136 --> 27:15.136
Old-school.

27:19.345 --> 27:20.762
Now find out
who owns that number.

27:35.679 --> 27:39.595
Got any questions?
'Cause this is the time.

27:39.679 --> 27:41.762
Only about the riverbed.

27:41.845 --> 27:43.261
You'll let me know?

27:43.345 --> 27:44.780
You'll know,
'cause we're fucking running.

27:44.804 --> 27:46.845
You don't need to worry
about it on the way out.

27:46.929 --> 27:48.154
There's just spotters
when we head out.

27:48.178 --> 27:50.261
It's the way back
that's the problem.

27:50.345 --> 27:51.625
So they'll have eyes on us?

27:51.679 --> 27:52.804
Starting now.

27:52.887 --> 27:55.595
Where the road ends,
the Taliban begins.

28:13.720 --> 28:16.178
Should we walk
or would you rather go inside?

28:19.428 --> 28:21.929
Let's walk.

28:22.011 --> 28:25.011
I was emotional before
and rude.

28:25.095 --> 28:26.303
I apologize.

28:27.679 --> 28:29.220
Apology accepted.

28:30.720 --> 28:33.011
I've been meaning to ask
about your father.

28:33.095 --> 28:34.303
How is he?

28:34.387 --> 28:36.804
Stepfather, and poorly,
I'm afraid.

28:36.887 --> 28:39.303
The MS is starting to affect
his vision.

28:39.387 --> 28:41.095
I'm sorry to hear that.

28:41.178 --> 28:42.279
Must be proud of you, though,

28:42.303 --> 28:44.178
getting the job
he always wanted.

28:44.261 --> 28:46.345
I think he'd have
preferred grandchildren.

28:46.428 --> 28:48.220
You said you needed to see me.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.970
Frankly, I'm at a loss.
I don't know what to do.

28:52.053 --> 28:54.887
- About what?
- You.

28:54.970 --> 28:55.970
Me?

28:56.011 --> 28:57.720
Well, Pakistan.

28:57.804 --> 29:00.595
I was hoping for another
adult in the room.

29:00.679 --> 29:02.239
Seems all you're interested in
is making

29:02.303 --> 29:04.679
what's already a difficult
situation impossible.

29:04.762 --> 29:06.804
I'm sorry.
Am I missing something here?

29:06.887 --> 29:09.178
Weren't you just apologizing
30 seconds ago?

29:09.261 --> 29:11.011
I was, now I'm imploring.

29:11.095 --> 29:12.679
Really?

29:12.762 --> 29:15.303
Because that's not
what it sounds like.

29:15.387 --> 29:17.220
I know we want
the same thing here.

29:17.303 --> 29:20.303
- Do we?
- Yes.

29:20.387 --> 29:22.553
Fair and durable peace
in the region.

29:23.637 --> 29:27.428
Don't lecture me
about peace in the region.

29:27.512 --> 29:28.887
You abandoned the region

29:28.970 --> 29:31.470
after the Soviets
were sent packing.

29:31.553 --> 29:33.595
Then 9/11 happened
and you're back.

29:33.679 --> 29:35.428
We've all seen this movie.

29:35.512 --> 29:37.512
We know how it ends...

29:37.595 --> 29:40.345
in chaos and civil war
on our border.

29:40.428 --> 29:42.136
That's exactly what
we're trying to avoid.

29:42.220 --> 29:43.762
How?

29:43.845 --> 29:46.470
By announcing timetables
and benchmarks?

29:46.553 --> 29:48.136
By unilaterally drawing down

29:48.220 --> 29:51.011
your combat troop levels
to zero?

29:51.095 --> 29:54.303
The Afghan state you've built
is a house of cards,

29:54.387 --> 29:56.136
its army a joke.

29:56.220 --> 30:00.762
You want real resolution,
then show some real resolve.

30:02.053 --> 30:04.053
At least make the Taliban think

30:04.136 --> 30:05.637
you aren't running
for the exits.

30:07.470 --> 30:10.053
Policy's the policy.

30:10.136 --> 30:11.845
No way that is changing now.

30:13.595 --> 30:16.303
Then peace isn't what you want.

30:16.387 --> 30:18.345
You just want out.

31:21.887 --> 31:25.387
speaking foreign language

31:55.261 --> 31:57.178
All right, we're here.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.970
You see the kid?

32:13.970 --> 32:15.595
Where?

32:15.679 --> 32:16.929
By the caves.

32:30.887 --> 32:33.970
Come on, get a move on.
We don't got all night.

33:08.679 --> 33:10.929
They sent the fucking A-team.

34:26.344 --> 34:27.637
Carrie!

34:27.719 --> 34:29.011
Arman, how are you?

34:29.094 --> 34:30.844
Good, good, prosperous.

34:30.929 --> 34:32.637
Yeah, I can see that.

34:32.719 --> 34:34.219
23 in the fleet now.

34:34.303 --> 34:37.011
This one, it is brand-new,
10,000 gallons.

34:37.094 --> 34:38.011
Beautiful.

34:38.094 --> 34:39.219
All thanks to you.

34:39.303 --> 34:40.469
Hardly.

34:40.553 --> 34:42.237
You built this yourself,
Arman, from nothing.

34:42.261 --> 34:45.094
One rented truck,
and who helped me rent it?

34:46.719 --> 34:48.053
This is for Daria.

34:48.136 --> 34:50.387
I tried to get the Lancome,
but I couldn't find it.

34:50.469 --> 34:52.011
Never mind.

34:52.094 --> 34:53.469
She will love
whatever you bring.

34:53.553 --> 34:55.428
So who's driving me tonight?

34:55.512 --> 34:56.512
I am.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.345
- You are?
- Yeah.

34:58.428 --> 34:59.905
But I thought you don't
drive anymore.

34:59.929 --> 35:01.887
I do for you.

35:07.345 --> 35:08.845
Nothing has changed:

35:08.929 --> 35:11.053
bribes, extortion, murder.

35:11.136 --> 35:14.720
It is criminal enterprise,
this government.

35:14.804 --> 35:17.720
And G'ulom himself, where does
he fit in these days?

35:17.804 --> 35:20.095
Oh, he's at the very top
of the pyramid.

35:20.178 --> 35:21.658
He's more powerful
than the President.

35:23.220 --> 35:24.720
Then I need to find an enemy,

35:24.804 --> 35:26.637
someone willing
to bring him down.

35:26.720 --> 35:29.136
Maybe one
of the other ministers.

35:29.220 --> 35:32.136
Don't bother.
They don't have the guts.

35:34.303 --> 35:35.845
What about Faqiar?

35:35.929 --> 35:37.863
I read somewhere he was running
an anti-corruption campaign.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.387
G'ulom paid him off.

35:40.470 --> 35:43.762
I hear he's in Dubai now.
He's living like a king.

35:43.845 --> 35:47.095
The law in this country,
it is only for the poor.

35:51.553 --> 35:52.970
Taliban?

35:53.053 --> 35:55.011
Most likely pro-Taliban
kochi nomads.

35:55.095 --> 35:58.428
They are very brave
to be fighting Sunni in Kabul.

35:58.512 --> 36:00.762
I thought Ghazni was as far
as they'd advanced.

36:00.845 --> 36:02.095
That was last month.

36:02.178 --> 36:04.679
Today, they make attacks
on Afghan army positions

36:04.762 --> 36:05.887
almost anywhere.

36:09.929 --> 36:11.512
That was closer.

36:11.595 --> 36:14.470
I give them free gas
in exchange for safe passage.

36:14.553 --> 36:15.637
I think we'll be fine.

36:24.178 --> 36:26.720
Ghazni.

36:26.804 --> 36:28.804
Ah, right, checkpoint.

36:47.929 --> 36:49.720
All clear.

36:52.011 --> 36:53.261
No checkpoint, huh?

36:53.345 --> 36:55.178
- No.
- What's that mean?

36:55.261 --> 36:56.970
I don't know.
How long will you be?

36:57.053 --> 36:59.512
An hour at the most.
I'll text you when I'm ready.

36:59.595 --> 37:00.512
Okay.

37:34.095 --> 37:36.512
speaking foreign language

38:41.887 --> 38:43.136
Are you Sheena?

38:48.178 --> 38:49.929
Do you speak English?

38:50.011 --> 38:51.637
English study, Pashto.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.762
Good.

38:53.845 --> 38:56.261
I'm so sorry to disturb you
at night.

38:56.345 --> 38:58.929
Your husband has told me
wonderful things.

38:59.011 --> 39:00.845
It's really an honor
to meet you.

39:00.929 --> 39:02.970
I met Zarawar
when he was this high.

39:03.053 --> 39:04.929
He's so big.

39:05.011 --> 39:06.970
Uh, is Roshan here?

39:07.053 --> 39:08.345
No.

39:10.553 --> 39:12.595
Okay, do... do you know
when he'll be back?

39:12.679 --> 39:14.011
No.

39:16.637 --> 39:18.303
I really would like to see him.

39:18.387 --> 39:20.136
Would you mind calling him
for me?

39:20.220 --> 39:23.220
No, I'm sorry.
You should go.

39:25.845 --> 39:28.178
I understand it's uncomfortable
having a strange woman

39:28.261 --> 39:29.303
speak to your husband,

39:29.387 --> 39:31.929
but it's... it's very,
very important.

39:32.011 --> 39:33.470
And I'm not gonna leave
your house

39:33.553 --> 39:34.637
until you contact him.

39:34.720 --> 39:35.905
Can you please pick up
your phone?

39:35.929 --> 39:37.178
I said no.

39:38.929 --> 39:41.303
speaks foreign language

39:41.387 --> 39:43.553
Tell me what?

39:51.011 --> 39:53.345
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

39:53.428 --> 39:55.929
I didn't know.

39:56.011 --> 39:58.011
They killed him.

39:59.053 --> 40:00.303
Who did?

40:00.387 --> 40:02.970
The Taliban, because of you.

40:03.053 --> 40:05.220
Because of the CIA.

40:05.303 --> 40:07.220
No, no, that's...
that's not possible.

40:07.303 --> 40:09.220
They said,
"This is what happens

40:09.303 --> 40:11.261
to a traitor
for the Americans."

40:11.345 --> 40:13.136
They pulled him from the house,

40:13.220 --> 40:15.762
ropes on his hands, feet...

40:15.845 --> 40:17.512
tied him to a truck,

40:17.595 --> 40:19.887
dragged him
through the streets.

40:19.970 --> 40:21.970
Oh, Sheena, I'm so sorry.

40:22.053 --> 40:23.095
Zarawar...

40:23.178 --> 40:24.720
Don't speak to my son.

40:26.470 --> 40:27.887
You have to believe me.

40:27.970 --> 40:30.470
I never told anyone
about my meetings with Roshan,

40:30.553 --> 40:33.053
not... not even the people
I work for, nobody.

40:35.220 --> 40:37.470
Is it... is it possible he had
another American contact?

40:38.845 --> 40:39.970
Only you.

40:42.762 --> 40:44.220
When did this happen?

40:45.553 --> 40:46.804
Five months ago.

40:49.845 --> 40:51.470
I don't... I...

40:51.553 --> 40:53.470
I... I... I... I wasn't
even in Afghanistan.

40:53.553 --> 40:55.762
I was in prison.

40:55.845 --> 41:00.053
I never told anyone his name.
Please... please believe me.

41:00.136 --> 41:02.970
I'm s... I'm so sorry.

41:04.303 --> 41:05.804
You should go now.

41:08.220 --> 41:09.387
Get out of my house.

41:25.804 --> 41:27.845
Did you ever reveal
the identity of an asset?

41:27.929 --> 41:29.512
No.

41:29.595 --> 41:31.237
Maybe somebody who died
ten years before.

41:31.261 --> 41:32.404
No.
Assets have families.

41:32.428 --> 41:33.553
I wouldn't do that.

41:33.637 --> 41:35.845
Ms. Mathison,
how can you be so sure

41:35.929 --> 41:37.220
if there's 180 days
of your life

41:37.303 --> 41:38.303
you don't remember?

41:44.970 --> 41:46.428
No, stay.

41:48.136 --> 41:49.136
Don't leave me.

41:49.178 --> 41:51.095
Don't leave me.

41:51.178 --> 41:53.845
Stay.
Stay, stay.

41:55.512 --> 41:56.887
shouting in foreign language

42:08.220 --> 42:10.970
shouting in foreign language

42:23.136 --> 42:24.345
Fuck!

42:24.428 --> 42:27.470
speaking foreign language

42:34.011 --> 42:36.762
speaking foreign language

42:43.804 --> 42:45.887
shouting foreign language

43:01.470 --> 43:04.011
speaks foreign language

43:08.887 --> 43:11.762
speaking in foreign language

43:16.762 --> 43:18.387
speaks foreign language

43:28.136 --> 43:30.136
shouts foreign language

43:45.220 --> 43:47.178
Are you done yet?

43:47.261 --> 43:48.345
No.

43:48.428 --> 43:50.220
How much longer?

43:50.303 --> 43:51.553
I don't know.

43:51.637 --> 43:53.345
I thought I could fix
the switch box,

43:53.428 --> 43:54.428
but it's not working.

43:54.470 --> 43:56.220
I gotta swap it out.

43:56.303 --> 43:57.720
How involved is that?

44:01.929 --> 44:03.428
Fuck this, man.

44:03.512 --> 44:06.261
Well, it's gonna be light
in an hour.

44:06.345 --> 44:07.845
You're gonna have to
wrap it up.

44:09.512 --> 44:12.470
You go ahead.
I'll find my own way back.

44:14.345 --> 44:16.011
Come on, huddle up.

44:18.095 --> 44:20.470
Hey, we're going.

44:20.553 --> 44:22.178
I'm not leaving until I'm done.

44:22.261 --> 44:24.303
Just pick up
your fucking bag and walk.

44:26.345 --> 44:29.053
We don't have
a functional listening device

44:29.136 --> 44:31.512
in 14 miles
of the Pakistani border.

44:31.595 --> 44:34.595
We're in negotiations
with the Taliban in Doha.

44:34.679 --> 44:36.679
Our people don't know
if they are having

44:36.762 --> 44:39.345
a real conversation
or if it's just bullshit

44:39.428 --> 44:41.178
designed to get us to release

44:41.261 --> 44:43.679
1,000 Taliban fighters
from prison.

44:44.970 --> 44:48.512
Hasan Hakhami is
down there somewhere.

44:48.595 --> 44:51.804
He's the one calling the shots
in a hideout in Pakistan

44:51.887 --> 44:54.804
that we can't find,
on a phone that we can't tap.

44:56.845 --> 44:59.428
He's the guy that slaughtered
36 of our people

44:59.512 --> 45:00.804
in Islamabad.

45:03.053 --> 45:04.720
I watched him do it.

45:06.053 --> 45:08.387
You were there, at the embassy?

46:15.053 --> 46:16.387
It's not that you went out,

46:16.470 --> 46:17.905
it's that you went out
without informing anybody.

46:17.929 --> 46:18.845
Mike...

46:18.929 --> 46:19.845
And don't give me any bullshit

46:19.929 --> 46:21.387
about source protection

46:21.470 --> 46:22.780
or "better to ask forgiveness
than permission."

46:22.804 --> 46:24.595
I don't need anybody's
permission.

46:24.679 --> 46:26.613
I'm here on behalf of
the National Security Advisor.

46:26.637 --> 46:27.720
God damn it, Carrie.

46:27.804 --> 46:29.279
There are three teams
out there right now

46:29.303 --> 46:30.720
risking their lives
to find you.

46:30.804 --> 46:31.905
Well, I didn't ask
for that either.

46:31.929 --> 46:35.553
Well, for your sake,
I hope it was worth it.

46:35.637 --> 46:37.470
Wh... what's that supposed
to mean?

46:37.553 --> 46:40.220
That you got what you needed,
because G'ulom's office called.

46:40.303 --> 46:41.446
Your meeting's been
rescheduled.

46:41.470 --> 46:43.178
- For when?
- This morning.

46:43.261 --> 46:44.387
Six hours from now.

46:44.470 --> 46:46.220
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

46:47.929 --> 46:50.553
Jenna will be here at 8:45
to pick you up.

46:50.637 --> 46:52.553
Hey, Mike.

46:52.637 --> 46:54.553
I need to ask you something.

46:54.637 --> 46:55.804
What?

46:57.512 --> 47:00.345
About Russian cooperation
with the Taliban.

47:00.428 --> 47:01.845
How real is it?

47:03.553 --> 47:04.845
Real enough.

47:06.762 --> 47:08.095
What does that look like,
exactly?

47:08.178 --> 47:09.595
Military aid, advisors?

47:09.679 --> 47:10.929
Both.

47:13.136 --> 47:15.303
What about intelligence?
Are they sharing intelligence?

47:15.387 --> 47:17.595
You bet,
anything to piss us off.

47:17.679 --> 47:18.919
It's what the Kremlin
lives for.

47:22.178 --> 47:24.887
I see.

47:24.970 --> 47:26.762
Why do you ask?

47:27.762 --> 47:29.428
I don't know.

47:29.512 --> 47:32.136
I just... I'm trying to get
the lay of the land, I guess.

47:32.220 --> 47:33.460
Where were you tonight, Carrie?

47:35.720 --> 47:38.040
Well, maybe you can tell me
how it relates to Russia, then.

47:39.136 --> 47:40.053
How what relates?

47:40.136 --> 47:41.376
You're here to leverage G'ulom,

47:41.428 --> 47:42.637
but you're asking Russia.

47:42.720 --> 47:44.136
Jesus, Mike, not you too.

47:44.220 --> 47:45.428
What the hell'd they tell you?

47:45.512 --> 47:47.053
That you tanked a polygraph.

47:52.720 --> 47:54.887
I was in Ghazni, okay,
meeting a guy

47:54.970 --> 47:56.363
who used to run against
the insurgents.

47:56.387 --> 47:57.780
He mentioned a GRU contact
in the area.

47:57.804 --> 47:59.637
- Who?
- Well, he wasn't naming names,

47:59.720 --> 48:00.720
was he?

48:05.220 --> 48:06.553
Okay.

48:10.220 --> 48:12.679
Okay.

48:17.428 --> 48:20.428
You look tired.
You should get some rest.

48:20.512 --> 48:22.136
Big day tomorrow.

48:22.220 --> 48:23.428
Yeah.

49:49.345 --> 49:51.762
All right, I'm pushing up
with Stout.

49:51.845 --> 49:53.071
Cover till we're behind
the boulders.

49:53.095 --> 49:55.804
Durkin, you and Soto got
rear security.

49:55.887 --> 49:58.261
Remember what I told you about
that path at the riverbed?

49:58.345 --> 50:00.178
Watch out.

50:00.261 --> 50:03.136
This is it.
Remember what to do?

50:04.345 --> 50:05.762
Haul ass.

50:05.845 --> 50:07.804
Wait till I tell you.

50:07.887 --> 50:09.929
- Ready?
- Yeah.

50:10.011 --> 50:10.929
Move.

50:23.220 --> 50:25.011
Stay down.

50:43.929 --> 50:45.220
Set.

50:45.303 --> 50:46.428
Okay.

50:46.512 --> 50:47.637
Your turn.

50:47.720 --> 50:50.136
Hey, tell me when.

50:51.512 --> 50:52.804
When.

50:54.053 --> 50:57.011
Look, they're right there.
Okay?

50:57.095 --> 50:58.679
Go, go.

51:15.845 --> 51:17.595
Motherfucker.

51:24.553 --> 51:26.011
Come on.
On the wall.

51:26.095 --> 51:27.387
On the wall.

51:29.261 --> 51:31.095
We got him.

51:36.095 --> 51:39.178
Where the fuck are they?

51:39.261 --> 51:41.053
Some patient motherfuckers.

51:41.136 --> 51:42.512
Fuck this place.

51:42.595 --> 51:44.303
You ready?

51:44.387 --> 51:46.595
- No.
- Let's move.

52:15.220 --> 52:17.428
Move, move, move!

52:25.970 --> 52:27.512
Now!
Coming in, coming in!

52:37.011 --> 52:38.220
Everybody okay?

52:38.303 --> 52:40.512
- Yeah.
- Brace for a second attack.

52:40.595 --> 52:42.595
Viper zero-two,
troops in contact.

52:42.679 --> 52:44.428
I say it again.
Troops in contact.

52:44.512 --> 52:46.432
Viper
zero-two is two mikes out.

52:46.512 --> 52:47.655
I'll give you a ten-second...

52:47.679 --> 52:48.821
Negative.
We need close air support.

52:48.845 --> 52:50.595
I repeat, close air support.

52:50.679 --> 52:51.905
Roger,...

52:51.929 --> 52:53.303
What the fuck is that?
Am I hit?

52:53.387 --> 52:54.762
Am I hit?

52:54.845 --> 52:57.679
Shit.

52:59.762 --> 53:00.679
Just your CamelBak.

53:00.762 --> 53:02.220
What?

53:02.303 --> 53:03.804
It's water.

53:03.887 --> 53:05.762
Ha.
I thought that fucker hit me.

53:05.845 --> 53:08.470
It's water or piss.
It ain't blood.

53:10.053 --> 53:11.404
I thought that motherfucker
hit me.

53:11.428 --> 53:14.220
Hey, get down!

53:14.303 --> 53:16.970
This ain't over.

53:17.053 --> 53:18.804
Where the hell are those
air assets?

53:18.887 --> 53:20.136
One minute out.

53:28.887 --> 53:31.053
Coming down from Sar Ridge,
where else?

53:31.136 --> 53:33.804
In broad daylight?
Nobody got hit?

53:33.887 --> 53:37.095
My pack got hit,
blew my fucking water open.

53:37.178 --> 53:38.553
You pissed yourself?

53:38.637 --> 53:40.136
No, my actual water pack.

53:40.220 --> 53:41.512
He fucking pissed himself.

53:43.387 --> 53:44.720
No, I didn't.

53:44.804 --> 53:48.053
One casualty:
water transport apparatus.

53:48.136 --> 53:51.679
Cable Guy, he's like a... he's
like a lucky fucking charm.

53:51.762 --> 53:53.303
Cable Guy.

53:53.387 --> 53:56.345
You're like a frosted
Lucky Charm, man.

53:57.762 --> 53:58.845
You're all right.

53:58.929 --> 54:00.387
Look at his face.

54:00.470 --> 54:02.637
He's still freaked out.

54:06.011 --> 54:07.512
You good, pal?

54:10.220 --> 54:12.095
It's working.

54:15.095 --> 54:17.345
Heh.

54:48.887 --> 54:50.845
Thank you.

54:50.929 --> 54:53.804
Here you go.

54:56.220 --> 54:58.637
Ms. Mathison,
this way, please.

55:03.178 --> 55:05.720
The Vice President is
completing another meeting.

55:05.804 --> 55:06.946
He will be ready in a moment.

55:06.970 --> 55:08.637
Thank you.

55:13.720 --> 55:15.303
You okay?

55:15.387 --> 55:16.738
Mike told me you were
out late last night.

55:16.762 --> 55:18.679
I'm fine.

55:20.220 --> 55:23.261
You know you're not going
in there with me, right?

55:23.345 --> 55:24.929
I'm sure you're smart enough
to realize

55:25.011 --> 55:26.387
the Vice President's
not opening up

55:26.470 --> 55:29.178
with some female in the room
he's never met before.

56:16.011 --> 56:17.845
Don't leave me.
Don't leave me.

56:17.929 --> 56:19.095
Don't leave me.

56:19.178 --> 56:23.679
Stay, stay, stay, stay.

56:27.387 --> 56:29.887
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

56:29.970 --> 56:32.428
No!
No!

56:32.512 --> 56:35.762
You can't leave me here!
You can't leave me here!

56:35.845 --> 56:37.136
No!

56:37.220 --> 56:40.428
Don't go!
Don't go!
