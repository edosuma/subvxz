WEBVTT

00:09.630 --> 00:11.808
Beyond space and time,

00:11.850 --> 00:15.738
lies a dimension where life
has evolved into machines,

00:15.780 --> 00:18.558
and the most dangerous
weapon in the universe

00:18.600 --> 00:21.342
is a force called love.

02:06.930 --> 02:08.928
We've detected an unidentified spacecraft

02:08.970 --> 02:10.398
approaching the citadel.

02:10.440 --> 02:12.231
They are not responding
to our transmissions.

02:13.198 --> 02:14.845
They're going
to smash into the energy field

02:14.887 --> 02:16.447
if they don't slow down.

02:16.489 --> 02:19.608
Something's wrong. The
energy shields are dropping.

02:19.650 --> 02:22.120
Impossible.

02:35.095 --> 02:36.454
Red alert.

02:36.496 --> 02:39.428
Energy shield has been deactivated.

02:39.470 --> 02:41.557
All units stand by.

03:01.653 --> 03:03.444
Situation critical,

03:03.486 --> 03:05.077
Situation critical.

03:05.119 --> 03:09.002
All units proceed to the citadel.

03:40.709 --> 03:43.368
Ah, what you got
there, a karaoke machine?

03:43.410 --> 03:44.593
I don't know what it is,

03:44.635 --> 03:47.126
but it's gonna bury us
in gold-coated plastic

03:47.168 --> 03:48.678
for years to come.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.118
Better find a good place to hide it,

03:50.160 --> 03:53.658
in case we get boarded by
the interplanetary goon squad.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.169
Yeah, I'll just tuck it away

03:55.211 --> 03:57.258
in one of these junkers over here.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.728
Gonna have to talk to Krogarr

03:58.770 --> 04:01.698
about using our ship as a storage unit.

04:01.740 --> 04:04.713
You think if we sold this
for scrap, he would notice?

04:04.755 --> 04:08.328
Ah, if you know Krogarr,
he's got inventory on everything.

04:08.370 --> 04:10.263
Yeah, I hear ya.

04:26.115 --> 04:29.538
For thousands of years,
the Arculon Destroyer

04:29.580 --> 04:33.408
has protected our planet
from the intergalactic hoards

04:33.450 --> 04:36.198
that would seek to strip of its resources.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.868
We must activate the Destructivas.

04:38.910 --> 04:41.718
Only their primitive
warlike ways can save us.

04:41.760 --> 04:44.194
The Destructivas are too unpredictable.

04:44.236 --> 04:46.248
They may elect to destroys us themselves.

04:46.290 --> 04:47.688
We have no choice.

04:47.730 --> 04:50.688
Once word gets out
that the Arculon is gone,

04:50.730 --> 04:53.892
our world will be picked
apart from all sides.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.778
Are you sure you want to do this?

05:05.820 --> 05:08.280
Once they're out, there's no turning back.

05:09.379 --> 05:10.470
Do it.

05:39.866 --> 05:43.388
You have reached the
doors of enlightenment.

05:43.430 --> 05:46.818
To open the gates and
advance to the next level,

05:46.860 --> 05:49.068
you must choose.

05:49.110 --> 05:51.063
The all-seeing heart of love,

05:52.200 --> 05:55.143
or the chainsaw of destruction.

05:56.190 --> 05:59.838
One will take you into a
world of joy and happiness.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.908
Hmm. Ugh.

06:01.950 --> 06:04.338
The other
will take you to a place

06:04.380 --> 06:06.978
of death and destruction.

06:07.020 --> 06:08.519
Ah, yes!

06:18.376 --> 06:21.215
Hey. Take it easy. I'm just an employee!

06:25.735 --> 06:29.186
Who dares
awaken us from our slumber?

06:29.228 --> 06:31.410
Please. We mean you no harm.

06:34.555 --> 06:36.511
What year is this?

06:36.553 --> 06:39.362
The year is 8675309.

06:39.404 --> 06:41.810
Our world is in desperate
need of your capabilities.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.733
I was having the strangest dream.

06:45.570 --> 06:49.218
Everything was green
and I was made of water.

06:49.260 --> 06:52.203
For thousands of years while you slept,

06:52.245 --> 06:54.965
our world has evolved into a utopia,

06:55.007 --> 06:57.332
free from war and strife.

06:57.374 --> 06:59.897
Our utopia's come to
rely on a super weapon

06:59.939 --> 07:01.338
called the Arculon Destroyer.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.228
It has been stolen from us.

07:03.270 --> 07:06.648
We are now defenseless
against the thousands of worlds

07:06.690 --> 07:08.658
that hunger for our resources.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.328
This weapon is so important to you,

07:11.370 --> 07:13.428
yet you lose it so easily.

07:13.470 --> 07:15.199
Why do you call on us?

07:15.241 --> 07:17.268
We need your help to
hunt down the Arculon

07:17.310 --> 07:19.728
and return it to us so
we may defend our world.

07:19.770 --> 07:21.318
Clean up your own messes.

07:21.360 --> 07:24.017
I was one step away from
enlightenment, you droogs.

07:24.059 --> 07:27.108
Retrieve the Arculon
Destroyer and you will be returned

07:27.150 --> 07:29.958
to the dream existence with
which you were extracted.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.938
Never to be bothered again.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.618
You have our word.

07:33.660 --> 07:36.948
They have proven to
be honorable custodians

07:36.990 --> 07:37.995
of our hyper sleep.

07:38.037 --> 07:40.038
Mytra?

07:40.080 --> 07:42.588
I'm on board with
whatever you want to do.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.421
I dunno.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.653
Ugh. All right then.

07:45.695 --> 07:48.103
We accept your terms.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.588
We've located the
Arculon heading 38 degrees

07:55.630 --> 07:57.678
towards the outer rim of the galaxy.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.928
Most likely to be delivered
to one of the many pirates

07:59.970 --> 08:01.638
that reside in that sector.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.948
We have your coordinates locked in.

08:03.990 --> 08:06.588
We will bring back your weapon.

08:06.630 --> 08:09.417
May the eternal drums
of the night guide your way.

08:09.459 --> 08:11.315
Okay, get on with it.

08:28.283 --> 08:31.008
This is cargo
transport vessel Egulon Nepsis,

08:31.050 --> 08:32.568
reporting heavy damage.

08:32.610 --> 08:35.009
Reactor core has ruptured.
Engines are inoperative.

08:35.051 --> 08:36.618
Our weapons have been disabled.

08:36.660 --> 08:38.208
Please send repair crew

08:38.250 --> 08:41.058
at the earliest possible convenience.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.458
This is cargo transport
vessel Egulon Nepsis,

08:43.500 --> 08:44.623
reporting heavy damage.

08:45.498 --> 08:46.715
Reactor has ruptured. Engine-

08:48.960 --> 08:50.598
So what are you gonna
do with all the tokens

08:50.640 --> 08:52.012
you're about to make?

08:52.054 --> 08:55.260
Trog not think so much about future.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.976
Trog always in present.

08:58.018 --> 09:02.317
Trog enjoy journey.
Not so much destination.

09:04.516 --> 09:06.948
Hey, it's a Kro mission!

09:06.990 --> 09:10.308
Hello my friends. How was your mission?

09:10.350 --> 09:12.768
Let me tell you, it's
been quite the adventure.

09:12.810 --> 09:14.628
And a successful one I might add.

09:14.670 --> 09:16.335
That's what I like to hear.

09:16.377 --> 09:19.368
Uh, you will all be rewarded mightily.

09:19.410 --> 09:23.147
May the solar winds
guide you to your salvation.

09:23.189 --> 09:24.656
Or whatever.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.858
What'd I tell you guys?

09:27.900 --> 09:31.308
Crime pays and pay is good. Ha!

09:31.350 --> 09:33.198
Yeah, but just think what we can do

09:33.240 --> 09:35.058
if we had the right tools.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.548
What are you getting at, Strobo?

09:37.590 --> 09:39.166
Time travel.

09:39.208 --> 09:40.518
Balderdash!

09:40.560 --> 09:43.488
No! It's the opposite of balderdash!

09:43.530 --> 09:45.978
Look, we find some time crystals,

09:46.020 --> 09:50.958
recalibrate a hyperspace
drive to fold space time,

09:51.000 --> 09:54.108
go back before the
beginning of all of this,

09:54.150 --> 09:55.668
and I don't know,

09:55.710 --> 09:59.658
go on "Wheel of Non-Fungibility".

09:59.700 --> 10:01.664
We'd be a big hit.

10:01.706 --> 10:03.010
Balderdash!

10:05.512 --> 10:08.598
We are representatives
sent by the Planet Radia

10:08.640 --> 10:11.298
to retrieve the Arculon Destroyer.

10:11.340 --> 10:14.877
Stand down now and prepare to be boarded.

10:14.919 --> 10:16.574
Balderdash!

10:24.331 --> 10:25.788
I think our ship just exploded.

10:25.830 --> 10:28.894
It matters not. We will take theirs.

10:38.237 --> 10:40.350
Come on, they just
landed the boarding craft.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.712
Haunted.

10:50.754 --> 10:52.013
Ghosts.

10:52.055 --> 10:55.314
Come on, we'll squeeze
through the service tube!

10:59.882 --> 11:02.315
All right, everybody
just settle down now.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.378
Where is the Arculon?

11:06.420 --> 11:08.642
Gone. We delivered it yesterday.

11:09.900 --> 11:12.897
Wrong! We traced the signal.

11:14.730 --> 11:16.518
You'll never find it on this ship.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.348
I hid it good. Ha!

11:18.390 --> 11:20.038
Found it.

11:31.843 --> 11:33.426
Everybody freeze!

11:34.737 --> 11:35.528
Like I said, free-

11:35.570 --> 11:38.223
Ah!

11:47.250 --> 11:49.687
Don't make another
move or I'll push the button.

11:50.633 --> 11:53.445
Young lady, you have no
idea what you're messing with.

11:53.487 --> 11:56.328
I don't suppose it's too
late to work out a deal?

11:56.370 --> 11:58.128
All right, into the escape pod.

11:58.170 --> 11:59.770
Don't make me push this button.

11:59.812 --> 12:00.969
Get in there.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.738
We have 600 tokens coming our way.

12:03.780 --> 12:05.808
We don't mind splitting it with you.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.568
Move it.

12:07.610 --> 12:09.708
You know what, you can take it all.

12:09.750 --> 12:12.828
Just take me with you. I'm good in a fight.

12:12.870 --> 12:15.797
These guys are cramping my style anyway.

12:19.110 --> 12:20.298
Well you are.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.398
We leave you with your lives.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.188
Others have not been so lucky.

12:25.230 --> 12:27.286
Pull that lever on your right.

12:37.230 --> 12:39.622
This is cargo
transport vessel Egulon Nepsis

12:39.664 --> 12:41.212
reporting heavy damage.

12:41.254 --> 12:43.883
Reactor core has ruptured.
Engines are inoperative.

12:43.925 --> 12:44.998
Our weapons have been disabled.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.469
Please send a repair crew

12:46.511 --> 12:48.729
at the earliest possible convenience.

12:52.018 --> 12:55.207
Egulon Nepsis reporting heavy
damage. Reactor core has-

12:55.249 --> 12:56.940
This transmission makes no sense.

12:56.982 --> 12:57.773
Our weapons...

12:57.815 --> 12:59.839
Why reveal you have no weapons?

12:59.881 --> 13:01.835
Foolish mechanoids.

13:01.877 --> 13:03.868
Or it's a trap.

13:03.910 --> 13:05.515
But if it's not...

13:05.557 --> 13:07.688
I feel we must know for sure.

13:07.730 --> 13:10.353
You know how good
deeds go.

13:10.395 --> 13:11.771
Weapons have been disabled.

13:11.813 --> 13:14.615
Please send repair crew at
earliest possible convenience.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.335
This is cargo transport
vessel Egulon Nepsis.

13:17.377 --> 13:20.083
It could be us in another life.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.260
We'll see.

13:21.302 --> 13:22.093
Our weapons...

13:22.135 --> 13:24.902
Mytra. Prepare a boarding craft.

13:24.944 --> 13:27.063
Roger. Prepping the boarding craft.

13:27.105 --> 13:29.335
If it's a trap, we'll make them pay.

13:29.377 --> 13:32.230
That we will, sister. That we will.

13:32.272 --> 13:34.538
"Mytra do this, Mytra do that."

13:34.580 --> 13:36.372
I wanna be in charge!

13:36.414 --> 13:39.647
Mytra. Your radio's still on.

13:39.689 --> 13:40.522
Oh.

13:42.823 --> 13:45.021
This is cargo
transport vessel Egulon Nepsis

13:45.063 --> 13:45.854
reporting heavy damage...

13:45.896 --> 13:48.138
We've got a heavy
cruiser closing in, sir.

13:48.180 --> 13:50.981
Sensors indicate the pirate ship Corsair.

13:51.023 --> 13:53.780
Excellent. Our plan
is coming to fruition.

13:53.822 --> 13:55.696
Prepare to activate the troopers.

13:55.738 --> 13:56.529
Yes sir.

14:25.119 --> 14:28.307
Ready yourselves, vermin.
Prepared to be rescued.

14:32.465 --> 14:34.424
Well, have we seen enough?

14:38.573 --> 14:41.764
It seems your instincts
are not without merit.

14:47.382 --> 14:50.586
Come on
out, we're here to help.

15:02.343 --> 15:04.496
See that? What'd I tell you.

15:04.538 --> 15:07.707
My faith in your
skepticism has been restored.

15:07.749 --> 15:09.329
We better find an exit.

15:16.437 --> 15:17.375
Mytra!

15:34.808 --> 15:36.969
They have defeated our troopers.

15:37.011 --> 15:38.753
Activate the weapon!

15:38.795 --> 15:41.532
Weapon activated.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.109
So cold.

15:46.656 --> 15:48.781
Tell my holo-cats I love them.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.664
Oh, stop it, you got a tiny scratch.

15:50.706 --> 15:52.130
Now get up so we can get outta here.

16:04.918 --> 16:08.738
I am peacekeeper. Prototype Exoria One.

16:08.780 --> 16:10.967
I have been tasked with your apprehension.

16:11.009 --> 16:13.505
Yeah sister, that's just
not gonna work out for you.

16:13.547 --> 16:16.245
Deactivate yourselves immediately

16:16.287 --> 16:19.094
and you will not be harmed.

16:40.844 --> 16:43.633
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

16:43.675 --> 16:47.570
Whoa!

16:55.445 --> 16:57.573
Is that all you've
got? You wait till I get my-

17:03.573 --> 17:07.767
I have a red cat, a
blue cat, a purple one.

17:09.083 --> 17:12.605
I've got a silver one too, and a gray one.

17:23.195 --> 17:25.931
Will the defendants please step forward.

17:25.973 --> 17:28.725
Blow it out
your gasket, lead head.

17:28.767 --> 17:30.686
We are not who you think we are.

17:30.728 --> 17:33.656
This has all been a
case of mistaken identity.

17:33.698 --> 17:35.653
Where are we?

17:35.695 --> 17:37.050
We, the representatives

17:37.092 --> 17:39.771
of the Third Robot
Empire's justice division,

17:39.813 --> 17:43.066
hereby find you guilty of deep space piracy

17:43.108 --> 17:44.867
and resistance of apprehension.

17:44.909 --> 17:47.016
Wait, don't we get a lawyer?

17:47.058 --> 17:49.614
I am certain their
decision has been made.

17:49.656 --> 17:52.862
We hereby sentence you
to a minimum of 1,000 years

17:52.904 --> 17:57.189
of hard labor in the mining
colonies of Arborus Seven.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.795
You can hereby kiss my shiny metal-

18:00.837 --> 18:03.545
Aah...

18:12.600 --> 18:16.161
We've got a transmission
coming in from the lead ship.

18:16.203 --> 18:18.444
Put it through.

18:18.486 --> 18:21.053
Lower your defenses, people of Radia.

18:21.095 --> 18:23.842
You no longer possess the Arculon Destroyer

18:23.884 --> 18:25.800
and cannot withstand our attack.

18:25.842 --> 18:27.311
We don't fear you, vultures.

18:27.353 --> 18:30.520
Turn back now before we pulverize you.

18:34.949 --> 18:36.897
I guess you scared them off.

18:40.634 --> 18:43.150
Where are you, Destructivas?

18:56.052 --> 18:57.553
Step off the pad and proceed

18:57.595 --> 19:00.614
toward the assimulation
facility for orientation.

19:00.656 --> 19:01.823
I've got a better idea.

19:01.865 --> 19:02.959
Why don't you give me that staff,

19:03.001 --> 19:03.972
so I can shove it up your...

19:04.014 --> 19:05.882
Aah!

19:05.924 --> 19:07.755
We are not here to make trouble.

19:26.902 --> 19:29.039
Krogarr, we've got a
coded transmission coming in

19:29.081 --> 19:31.854
from one of our spies on Arborus Seven.

19:31.896 --> 19:33.285
Put it through.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.966
Captain Krogarr, this is Agent Worlow.

19:37.008 --> 19:39.851
Three inmates just
arrived at Arborus Seven.

19:39.893 --> 19:42.233
They fit the description
of the three warriors

19:42.275 --> 19:45.929
who hijacked the Corsair
several days ago. Over.

19:45.971 --> 19:48.627
Good work Worlow.

19:48.669 --> 19:51.494
Prepare to receive extraction details.

19:54.172 --> 19:57.014
You will each be issued plasma blasters

19:57.056 --> 20:02.056
to break down metal ore
infused within the asteroid walls.

20:02.200 --> 20:05.302
A truck and crane unit
will be by periodically

20:05.344 --> 20:08.342
to pick up the products of your labor.

20:08.384 --> 20:11.669
You must meet a daily quota of four tons

20:11.711 --> 20:13.531
or you will be taken to the furnace,

20:13.573 --> 20:18.043
melted down, and
recycled into patio furniture.

20:18.085 --> 20:21.158
This is our last chance.
No one expects us to attack.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.243
Agreed. We act now.

20:23.285 --> 20:24.661
Wait, what?

20:24.703 --> 20:27.370
Trust me, now is not the time.

20:28.608 --> 20:29.603
What's it to you?

20:29.645 --> 20:33.235
I've got a line on something.
You might be interested.

20:33.277 --> 20:34.578
Better turn around.

20:34.620 --> 20:35.421
What?

20:41.086 --> 20:42.596
Not now.

20:42.638 --> 20:45.077
Remember.

20:45.119 --> 20:48.369
You break the rules, you pay the price.

21:12.184 --> 21:14.723
The Centuries are shielded
against the plasma blasters,

21:14.765 --> 21:16.106
if you're wondering.

21:16.148 --> 21:17.947
You like being a prisoner,
that's your business.

21:17.989 --> 21:20.657
I'm gonna escape or kill myself trying.

21:20.699 --> 21:22.150
In about 30 seconds,

21:22.192 --> 21:24.897
my time as a prisoner will come to an end.

21:24.939 --> 21:28.758
Keep your head down and so will yours.

21:47.124 --> 21:48.041
Here we go.

22:00.368 --> 22:01.486
Let's move.

22:01.528 --> 22:02.742
Where's Azalla?

22:08.957 --> 22:12.393
Return to your work stations immediately!

22:12.435 --> 22:14.559
Or be destroyed!

22:21.084 --> 22:22.617
I've got you, boss.

22:38.446 --> 22:41.086
Initiate self destruct sequence.

22:47.550 --> 22:51.303
Mission accomplished. Reel us back in.

23:14.521 --> 23:17.389
We're all on board. Hit the gas.

23:28.915 --> 23:30.926
Get off of me you dolt!

23:40.034 --> 23:41.750
Wilhelm scream!

23:44.503 --> 23:48.553
Oh! What a world, what
a world, what a world.

24:17.002 --> 24:20.657
Ah, these must
be the great warriors

24:20.699 --> 24:22.275
I've heard so much about.

24:22.317 --> 24:25.384
We've seen better days.
What do you want with us?

24:25.426 --> 24:28.509
Straight to the point. I like that.

24:29.685 --> 24:33.671
Several days ago I sent a
group of my best warriors,

24:33.713 --> 24:35.575
or so I thought,

24:35.617 --> 24:39.490
to obtain the device called
the Arculon Destroyer.

24:39.532 --> 24:41.989
We lost all contact with our comrades

24:42.031 --> 24:43.928
and we can only assume

24:43.970 --> 24:47.227
they've either been lost or destroyed.

24:47.269 --> 24:51.693
What is this, how do
you say, Arculon Destroyer?

24:51.735 --> 24:53.851
Yeah, what's an Arculon Destroyer?

24:53.893 --> 24:57.200
That's not important right now.

24:57.242 --> 24:59.669
We've tracked its
location to an impound unit

24:59.711 --> 25:00.971
on Taurus Five.

25:01.013 --> 25:03.691
An interplanetary justice location.

25:03.733 --> 25:06.293
We need a skilled band of raiders,

25:06.335 --> 25:08.053
such as yourselves,

25:08.095 --> 25:09.487
to break into it.

25:09.529 --> 25:13.189
You want us to raid an
outpost? We raid an outpost.

25:13.231 --> 25:14.840
I can't believe our luck.

25:14.882 --> 25:16.285
What are the chances?

25:16.327 --> 25:18.680
He's delivering the Arculon Destroyer

25:18.722 --> 25:20.168
right into our hands.

25:20.210 --> 25:21.318
Better play it cool.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.293
Yeah, this is all very interesting.

25:23.335 --> 25:24.891
What's in it for us?

25:24.933 --> 25:27.606
I can't believe they're falling for this.

25:27.648 --> 25:30.971
I really am
a criminal mastermind.

25:31.013 --> 25:32.754
Better play it cool.

25:32.796 --> 25:35.614
You get an autographed picture of me

25:35.656 --> 25:38.147
and I let you live.

25:40.934 --> 25:43.776
And I'll pay you 600 credits.

25:44.879 --> 25:46.725
If you want us to do heavy lifting,

25:46.767 --> 25:49.948
we will need weapons.

26:12.628 --> 26:13.944
Hey!

26:35.406 --> 26:36.691
An unidentified ship

26:36.733 --> 26:39.184
has just entered the outpost perimeter.

26:39.226 --> 26:41.265
Activate sentries.

26:50.013 --> 26:53.012
We're approaching the drop
zone. Are you ready for launch?

26:53.054 --> 26:54.544
Just get on with it.

27:15.115 --> 27:16.469
Hello, Worlow.

27:16.511 --> 27:21.100
Have we provided the
distraction you've been looking for?

27:21.142 --> 27:22.284
I'm all clear.

27:22.326 --> 27:25.171
Moving towards the impound as we speak.

27:39.092 --> 27:41.127
This isn't the impound.

27:47.700 --> 27:48.844
Sorry to do this to you,

27:48.886 --> 27:51.399
but the impound was too heavily guarded

27:51.441 --> 27:55.288
and I needed someone
to distract the patrols.

27:55.330 --> 27:59.016
You have performed your roles
with the greatest enthusiasm.

27:59.058 --> 28:01.405
Please feel free to keep the docking ship

28:01.447 --> 28:04.859
and as many tokens as you can carry.

28:04.901 --> 28:06.609
Krogarr out.

28:06.651 --> 28:07.844
Is trap?

28:07.886 --> 28:10.355
We were decoys the whole time.

28:19.174 --> 28:22.113
Please
enter the correct ignition code.

28:22.155 --> 28:23.761
I did enter the correct code.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.922
Mothership has departed.

28:25.964 --> 28:27.634
Ugh, we've been had!

29:10.685 --> 29:14.115
I am peacekeeper prototype Exoria Two.

29:14.157 --> 29:16.950
I have been tasked with your apprehension.

29:16.992 --> 29:19.294
Deactivate yourselves immediately

29:19.336 --> 29:20.849
and you will not be harmed.

29:20.891 --> 29:22.891
Ugh. Here we go again!

29:41.938 --> 29:45.103
We need some sort
of magnetic vacuum cleaner.

30:00.868 --> 30:04.698
This is peacekeeper prototype Exoria Two

30:04.740 --> 30:08.323
requesting back uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh...

30:11.262 --> 30:13.429
Help me! Help me! Help me!

30:21.738 --> 30:23.000
Let's get out of here.

30:29.659 --> 30:32.624
Engine requires maintenance.

30:32.666 --> 30:35.083
Come on, Don't cut out now.

30:59.861 --> 31:03.435
The Corsair has been
located and retrieved, Krogarr.

31:03.477 --> 31:05.998
En route to docking as we speak.

31:35.299 --> 31:37.187
It's a teleportation platform.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.896
Yes. But to where?

31:43.262 --> 31:44.679
Let's find out.

31:54.314 --> 31:55.672
Oh, no.

31:55.714 --> 31:58.926
Will the defendants please step forward?

31:58.968 --> 32:00.547
How about I step
forward, remove your head,

32:00.589 --> 32:01.380
and shove it up your-

32:01.422 --> 32:06.146
You have been accused of
prison escape, illegal recycling,

32:06.188 --> 32:08.912
breaking and entering, piracy,

32:08.954 --> 32:11.929
and destruction of private property.

32:11.971 --> 32:14.542
You forgot the murder
of three public officials.

32:14.584 --> 32:15.583
Good one.

32:15.625 --> 32:16.873
Don't help them.

32:16.915 --> 32:19.676
You have been sentenced
to serve out the remainder

32:19.718 --> 32:22.753
of your existence on the
inter-dimensional prison

32:22.795 --> 32:25.508
planetoid of Interprison.

32:25.550 --> 32:30.268
May the great programmer
have mercy on your circuits.

32:31.614 --> 32:33.228
Someone should have mercy on your ugly-

32:33.270 --> 32:36.361
Aah...

33:01.610 --> 33:04.006
Surrender now, people of Radia.

33:04.048 --> 33:06.470
And we promise to only torture three-thirds

33:06.512 --> 33:08.661
of the left sides of your bodies

33:08.703 --> 33:12.422
and four-quarters of your right side.

33:12.464 --> 33:13.489
The force field generators

33:13.531 --> 33:17.908
can't withstand this
bombardment for much longer.

33:17.950 --> 33:21.033
We may need to contemplate surrender.

33:23.403 --> 33:25.881
Where are you, Destructivas?

33:35.961 --> 33:37.715
What is this place?

33:37.757 --> 33:40.681
We appear to be inside
an artificial planetoid

33:40.723 --> 33:42.593
in a pocket dimension.

33:42.635 --> 33:45.713
If so, the skies would be impenetrable.

33:49.436 --> 33:52.142
It appears we are not alone.

34:25.797 --> 34:26.640
Get in quick!

34:26.682 --> 34:28.953
This place is gonna be
swarming with berzerkers

34:28.995 --> 34:30.245
any second now!

34:51.339 --> 34:52.422
All aboard!

35:28.060 --> 35:31.560
They made it back. Lower the drawbridge.

35:58.799 --> 35:59.632
Uh oh.

36:02.102 --> 36:05.922
Ah. You answered that
distress signal, didn't ya?

36:06.965 --> 36:08.557
Any way off this rock?

36:08.599 --> 36:10.670
Unfortunately this planet has been placed

36:10.712 --> 36:12.181
in a pocket dimension.

36:12.223 --> 36:14.644
There's no conventional way of escape.

36:14.686 --> 36:15.552
Lucky for us,

36:15.594 --> 36:18.568
Strobo built that time machine over there.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.032
Thank you, Max.

36:20.074 --> 36:21.269
While you're at it,

36:21.311 --> 36:23.302
why don't you just give
'em the launch codes

36:23.344 --> 36:27.286
so they can steal it and
leave us here stranded.

36:29.489 --> 36:30.280
Look.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.533
We'd take you with us,

36:31.575 --> 36:35.333
but we only have enough
time crystals for the four of us.

36:35.375 --> 36:39.899
We'll leave you the karaoke
machine in case you get bored.

36:39.941 --> 36:44.941
♪ Ahoo hey-eh-eh-eh ♪

36:47.402 --> 36:50.256
This, this is unfortunate.

36:50.298 --> 36:52.441
The fate of the universe is at stake

36:52.483 --> 36:54.147
and we are trapped here.

36:54.189 --> 36:55.681
The poor Radians.

36:57.098 --> 37:00.468
Left defenseless against
the scourges of the galaxy.

37:00.510 --> 37:03.089
While that mad man
Krogarr roams the galaxy

37:03.131 --> 37:04.816
with a doomsday weapon.

37:04.858 --> 37:08.338
Yeah, Strobo! Have some compassion, man.

37:08.380 --> 37:09.714
Strobo mean.

37:10.570 --> 37:12.944
Yeah, Strobo. You're just mean.

37:12.986 --> 37:15.210
Mean, man. Selfish.

37:15.252 --> 37:18.272
All right, already! I'll do what I can.

37:18.314 --> 37:19.653
Who wants to go out there with me

37:19.695 --> 37:22.080
and find some more time crystals?

37:24.163 --> 37:26.976
All right, you guys hold down the fort

37:27.018 --> 37:30.691
and you all don't even think
about using your feminine wiles

37:30.733 --> 37:33.272
to extract the codes from these bumpkins.

37:33.314 --> 37:35.231
They've got years of...

37:37.376 --> 37:38.668
No they don't.

38:22.046 --> 38:23.379
Trog ticklish.

38:28.189 --> 38:29.856
Now Trog tickle you.

38:35.646 --> 38:40.139
Try not to be distracted by
my sensuous movements, Auto.

38:40.181 --> 38:41.937
I know what you're trying to do, Luna.

38:41.979 --> 38:45.065
I am like the Alturian devil snake, no?

38:45.107 --> 38:46.151
It's not gonna work.

38:46.193 --> 38:48.281
My mind's like a box of concrete.

38:48.323 --> 38:50.964
Nothing's getting in or out.

38:57.135 --> 39:00.229
Oh yeah, a little to the right.

39:00.271 --> 39:03.983
No offense, but Trog
better at this than you.

39:04.025 --> 39:06.675
Yeah, less talk more drumming, pal.

39:06.717 --> 39:09.800
"Whoa, whoa, what are we gonna do?"

39:14.396 --> 39:19.396
It's me, Max,
here to save your butts again.

39:20.569 --> 39:22.735
The protector of the universe.

39:22.777 --> 39:26.031
"Oh, Max, you saved us again!"

39:26.073 --> 39:30.085
I know. It's what I do.

39:30.127 --> 39:32.254
"Oh, how are you so awesome?"

39:32.296 --> 39:37.296
I don't know. I just am.

39:38.132 --> 39:39.130
"I love you, Max!"

39:39.172 --> 39:42.902
I know.

39:45.014 --> 39:46.931
"Wait, don't leave us!"

39:47.810 --> 39:50.483
I'm back! I'm back again.

39:50.525 --> 39:52.022
To protect the universe.

39:52.064 --> 39:53.871
"Oh, we love you, Max."

39:53.913 --> 39:58.543
I know,
but I can't stay here for long.

39:58.585 --> 40:01.835
Sorry. I gotta save the universe again!

40:02.904 --> 40:05.972
"We love you Max!"

40:06.014 --> 40:11.014
"I wish you could stay!"

40:11.711 --> 40:14.884
Hello, Max. What are you doing?

40:14.926 --> 40:16.751
Playing with my toys.

40:16.793 --> 40:18.626
Ooh. Can I play too?

40:20.286 --> 40:21.119
Sure.

40:22.450 --> 40:23.639
Hey, look at me.

40:23.681 --> 40:25.738
I'm an innocent little robot girl,

40:25.780 --> 40:28.787
trapped on a planet with no way to escape.

40:28.829 --> 40:31.987
If we only had the launch
codes to the time machine!

40:32.029 --> 40:34.915
Mmm. Tell me the launch codes, Max.

40:34.957 --> 40:37.930
What's that? You ate all of the donuts?

40:37.972 --> 40:40.218
This relationship is over.

40:40.260 --> 40:42.858
Save your tears for someone else.

40:42.900 --> 40:45.492
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.

40:45.534 --> 40:48.990
Mmm.

41:10.189 --> 41:12.943
Hmm. That looks familiar.

41:19.307 --> 41:21.457
Bunch of bull slag.

41:58.195 --> 42:03.195
1 8 9 7 3 2 4 8.

42:03.529 --> 42:06.070
Well that wasn't too
hard. Everybody buckled up?

42:06.112 --> 42:08.294
They are a curious lot.

42:08.336 --> 42:11.695
I detect a small pang. Is this guilt?

42:11.737 --> 42:13.265
Sure, a little bit.

42:13.307 --> 42:15.828
Maybe we wait till Strobo returns.

42:15.870 --> 42:19.022
We all leave together
like big happy family.

42:19.064 --> 42:20.923
Nah, let's just go.

42:20.965 --> 42:22.582
Yeah, let's go.

42:22.624 --> 42:24.377
Yes, they will understand.

43:25.949 --> 43:26.939
Alright.

43:26.981 --> 43:28.573
It was a harrowing adventure,

43:28.615 --> 43:32.444
but I managed to find
some more time crystal...

43:32.486 --> 43:33.563
All right.

43:33.605 --> 43:35.495
Who gave away the launch codes?

43:35.537 --> 43:36.865
Ha ha!

43:36.907 --> 43:39.356
Hey, where'd they go?

43:39.398 --> 43:42.023
Max! I should have known.

43:48.634 --> 43:50.443
Et tu, Auto.

43:50.485 --> 43:52.520
Seems like Trog and I are the only ones

43:52.562 --> 43:56.934
pulling our weight in
this glorious operation.

43:56.976 --> 43:59.740
Trog ready to leave dopey friends behind

43:59.782 --> 44:01.615
with great enthusiasm.

44:02.733 --> 44:04.316
Where the girls at?

44:06.412 --> 44:09.782
Well at least we got the karaoke machine.

44:09.824 --> 44:13.196
Well, nevermind. That's gone too.

44:13.238 --> 44:15.613
Hmm.

44:48.402 --> 44:49.985
Uh. Where are we?

45:01.475 --> 45:03.814
We've gone back to
the time of the initial raid.

45:03.856 --> 45:06.181
They've just stolen the Arculon Destroyer.

45:06.223 --> 45:07.776
We can strike now and return the Arculon

45:07.818 --> 45:09.513
before any of this happens.

45:09.555 --> 45:12.539
It won't work. How
would we exist right now?

45:12.581 --> 45:14.608
They would have no reason to wake us up.

45:14.650 --> 45:16.098
You're thinking about this too much.

45:16.140 --> 45:19.274
In gold-coated
plastic for years to come.

45:19.316 --> 45:20.839
Better find a good place to hide it,

45:20.881 --> 45:24.196
in case we get boarded by
the interplanetary goon squad.

45:24.238 --> 45:25.561
Yeah, I'll just tuck it away

45:25.603 --> 45:27.903
in one of these junkers over here.

45:27.945 --> 45:29.236
Gonna have to talk to Krogarr

45:29.278 --> 45:32.315
about using our ship... Hide!

45:32.357 --> 45:35.737
You think if we sold this
for scrap, he would notice?

45:35.779 --> 45:37.118
If you know Krogarr,

45:37.160 --> 45:39.353
he's got inventory on everything.

45:57.730 --> 45:59.974
Yeah, I hear ya.

46:22.291 --> 46:25.870
Trog, I'm starting to
believe this ship is haunted.

46:25.912 --> 46:27.831
That or we're gonna have
to start overhauling the wiring

46:27.873 --> 46:31.607
on this jalopy.

46:59.704 --> 47:03.454
Hmm. Must have picked
up some space ghosts.

47:22.227 --> 47:26.594
Whoa! Yeah! Finally making some gains!

47:29.137 --> 47:31.106
Whoa!

47:31.148 --> 47:32.880
Ah! I think there's something wrong

47:32.922 --> 47:35.048
with the artificial gravity.

47:38.287 --> 47:41.704
Oh, I'm think I'm gonna be sore tomorrow.

48:08.183 --> 48:09.891
Haunted.

48:09.933 --> 48:11.127
Ghosts.

48:11.169 --> 48:15.030
Come on, we'll squeeze
through the service tube!

48:19.358 --> 48:21.891
All right, everybody
just settle down now.

48:24.503 --> 48:26.076
Where is the Arculon?

48:26.118 --> 48:28.326
Gone. We delivered it yesterday.

48:29.294 --> 48:32.484
Wrong! We traced the signal.

49:05.728 --> 49:07.453
You'll never find it on this ship.

49:07.495 --> 49:09.272
I hid it good. Ha!

49:09.314 --> 49:10.916
Found it.

49:32.259 --> 49:34.716
This is cargo
transport vessel Egulon Nepsis

49:34.758 --> 49:36.085
reporting heavy damage.

49:36.127 --> 49:38.565
Reactor core has ruptured.
Engines are inoperative.

49:38.607 --> 49:40.184
Our weapons have been disabled.

49:40.226 --> 49:41.746
Please send repair crew

49:41.788 --> 49:44.484
at the earliest possible convenience.

49:44.526 --> 49:46.759
Ah. How young we were.

49:46.801 --> 49:48.258
And naive.

49:48.300 --> 49:51.853
Many lessons we have learned.

50:06.068 --> 50:07.938
The
ship appears to empty.

50:07.980 --> 50:10.323
Make sure you check the cargo bay.

50:14.479 --> 50:17.508
Whoa, easy. The gravity is all wonky.

50:17.550 --> 50:18.940
Place is haunted.

50:59.190 --> 51:00.798
Looks like we've got some time to kill.

51:00.840 --> 51:01.968
Any suggestions?

51:02.010 --> 51:03.738
We might as well help our past selves

51:03.780 --> 51:05.207
in their futile escape.

52:08.211 --> 52:11.272
Engine requires maintenance.

52:11.314 --> 52:13.731
Come on, don't cut out now.

52:22.492 --> 52:26.279
This is peacekeeper prototype Exoria Two

52:26.321 --> 52:29.821
requesting back uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh...

52:33.041 --> 52:35.208
Help me! Help me! Help me!

52:43.329 --> 52:45.003
Let's get outta here.

52:56.715 --> 52:57.548
Help me!

53:51.570 --> 53:54.108
We've safely entered hyperspace, Krogarr.

53:54.150 --> 53:55.458
There are no ships in pursuit.

53:55.500 --> 53:56.598
Excellent.

53:56.640 --> 53:59.718
I'll be down in the
docking bay. Hold my calls.

53:59.760 --> 54:02.213
We've got a transmission
coming in from Mohana.

54:02.255 --> 54:03.255
Should we ignore it?

54:04.453 --> 54:06.573
Put him through.

54:10.375 --> 54:11.166
Krogarr!

54:11.208 --> 54:13.668
It's been a long time, my old friend.

54:13.710 --> 54:15.468
I've heard chatter amongst the stars

54:15.510 --> 54:18.708
that you've raided a
certain little outpost?

54:18.750 --> 54:20.028
Well, yes.

54:20.070 --> 54:21.288
And would you believe it?

54:21.330 --> 54:24.558
We've managed to carry
away all 6 billion tokens

54:24.600 --> 54:25.587
that we owe you.

54:25.629 --> 54:26.568
Krogarr.

54:26.610 --> 54:30.498
I never doubted you for
more than a few millennia.

54:30.540 --> 54:32.688
I'll have my minions
transmit the coordinates

54:32.730 --> 54:34.338
for our rendezvous.

54:34.380 --> 54:38.568
May the solar winds guide
your way, et cetera, et cetera.

54:38.610 --> 54:40.214
Whatever. Just bring me my stuff.

54:57.420 --> 54:58.515
Well there it is.

54:58.557 --> 55:01.233
The infamous Arculon Destroyer.

55:02.259 --> 55:04.308
You know how to work this thing?

55:04.350 --> 55:07.218
If it's galactic domination you desire,

55:07.260 --> 55:10.780
then by pushing the big
red button, you will acquire.

55:39.601 --> 55:41.238
I'm not picking up
anything on the sensors.

55:41.280 --> 55:42.318
Are you sure they're coming?

55:42.360 --> 55:43.518
They'll be here.

55:43.560 --> 55:45.764
I owe that goon a lot of money.

56:12.540 --> 56:14.253
I knew they wouldn't disappoint.

56:15.540 --> 56:17.883
Prepare the Arculon Destroyer.

56:39.930 --> 56:41.996
Open up a channel.

56:42.038 --> 56:43.518
Krogarr.

56:43.560 --> 56:47.343
For once in my many
lives, I'm happy to see you!

56:48.180 --> 56:49.968
Now, Mohana.

56:50.010 --> 56:54.048
I confess, I may have
exaggerated a little bit

56:54.090 --> 56:56.418
on the 6 billion tokens.

56:56.460 --> 57:01.053
You dare to hoodwink the
great and powerful Mohana!

57:02.182 --> 57:04.458
Give me one reason not to blast you

57:04.500 --> 57:06.888
into radioactive space dust.

57:06.930 --> 57:09.048
You deceitful charlatan!

57:09.090 --> 57:12.888
Now Mohana, I know
we've had our differences.

57:12.930 --> 57:16.308
I've defaulted on a few loans, yes,

57:16.350 --> 57:21.078
I may or may not have destroyed
some of your space stations,

57:21.120 --> 57:22.998
and I assure you,

57:23.040 --> 57:26.479
had I known they were
your space stations...

57:26.521 --> 57:28.784
Captain Krogarr,

57:28.826 --> 57:31.565
the Arculon Destroyer is ready.

57:32.550 --> 57:35.268
You know what Mohana,
I've had it up to here

57:35.310 --> 57:39.078
with your ranting and
raving and complaining.

57:39.120 --> 57:42.348
You knuckle dragging moron.

57:42.390 --> 57:46.128
You primitive sub-humanoid being

57:46.170 --> 57:51.170
with your paid escorts and
your sycophantic followers.

57:51.840 --> 57:54.198
I think it's about time you learned

57:54.240 --> 57:56.817
who's really the boss around here.

57:56.859 --> 57:58.398
Krogarr!

57:58.440 --> 58:01.713
There will be no forgiveness.

58:03.450 --> 58:05.891
Activate the Arculon Destroyer.

58:05.933 --> 58:08.367
The Arculon Destroyer?!

58:08.409 --> 58:10.366
How can this be?

58:34.885 --> 58:37.443
♪ Ahoo hey-eh-eh-eh ♪

58:52.338 --> 58:53.171
Oh boy.

58:55.677 --> 58:57.916
Destroy that ship!

58:57.958 --> 59:00.312
Have a nice life, Krogarr.

59:07.982 --> 59:09.623
Whoa, what happened back there?

59:09.665 --> 59:10.456
Ah, who cares?

59:10.498 --> 59:12.498
We've got nothing but
the future ahead of us.

59:12.540 --> 59:16.836
Yes. The boundless freedoms
of our dreams awaits us.

59:26.020 --> 59:27.768
I'll get you, Destructivas.

59:27.810 --> 59:30.900
Somehow, someway, I'll get you.

59:47.310 --> 59:49.908
It appears we may be too late.

59:49.950 --> 59:52.737
Better late than never,
let's get this thing hooked up.

01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:12.310
It's time for distraction, no?

01:00:15.271 --> 01:00:16.104
Help me!

01:00:26.550 --> 01:00:30.288
I am peacekeeper prototype Exoria Two.

01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:33.318
I have not been tasked
with your apprehension.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.718
Deactivate yourselves immediately

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.644
and you will not be harmed.

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:44.388
Do yourself a favor and run, little girl.

01:00:44.430 --> 01:00:47.018
Events are about to get apocalyptic.

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:58.503
Distraction achieved. Let's go!

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:07.818
Mercy.

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.188
There will be no mercy this day.

01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:12.918
Without your precious Arculon Destroyer,

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.088
you're nothing but fodder

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:16.722
for my hoards of barbarous warriors.

01:01:20.177 --> 01:01:24.790
Who dares interrupt
my poetic pontifications.

01:01:28.881 --> 01:01:31.072
Um, I give up. I was just leaving.

01:01:31.114 --> 01:01:35.049
Thank you.

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:36.708
Uh, I have an announcement to make!

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:38.739
They have the Arculon Destroyer.

01:01:38.781 --> 01:01:40.371
Run for your lives!

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:02.595
You have done well, Destructivas.

01:02:02.637 --> 01:02:05.208
But your story is not over yet.

01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:06.584
You got your weapon back,

01:02:06.626 --> 01:02:08.451
now return us to our dream world.

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.643
All right, what's going on?

01:02:15.714 --> 01:02:18.783
I'm
gonna go look for a broom.

01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:23.268
You're not the only
ones with a time machine.

01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:26.088
We traveled back in time 10,000 years,

01:02:26.130 --> 01:02:27.948
introduced the Arculon Destroyer,

01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:30.918
and brought peace in
this once war-torn world.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.318
Just to see the looks on your faces.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.328
And to be honest, I'm
a little disappointed.

01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:39.693
10,000 years! Poker faces.

01:02:39.735 --> 01:02:41.101
Now, if you don't mind.

01:02:41.143 --> 01:02:43.068
We can get 600 coupons

01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:46.338
for delivering this bad boy to Krogarr.

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:48.296
So step aside.

01:02:48.338 --> 01:02:50.568
Well,
you better go back in time

01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:52.908
to about 10 hours ago.

01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:55.600
'Cause Krogarr is now a dead-garr.

01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:01.308
Surprise!

01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:04.698
I'm back, baby.

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.218
Thought you could pull
one over on me, did ya?

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:09.318
Back away from that Arculon Destroyer

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.277
or I'll fry your circuits.

01:03:11.319 --> 01:03:13.092
Bite me, Krogarr.

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:26.073
To enter the gates of
enlightenment, you must choose.

01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:31.340
The all-seeing heart of love,

01:03:31.382 --> 01:03:35.423
or the chainsaw of destruction.

01:03:37.744 --> 01:03:39.366
What are you doing in my dream?

01:03:39.408 --> 01:03:42.033
We're here to help you choose.

01:03:42.075 --> 01:03:44.945
This is an important decision.

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:45.820
Hmm.

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:49.278
I built my whole life around this moment.

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.038
Now that I have the Arculon Destroyer,

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.988
I can destroy my enemies

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:59.030
and anyone else who gets
in my way.

01:04:00.312 --> 01:04:02.358
Wait. Are we still getting paid?

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.708
Are you kidding me?

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:06.108
You idiots are the worst bunch of criminals

01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:09.498
I've ever had the
displeasure of working with.

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:12.526
I'll buy you a slice of
pizza, but nothing more.

01:04:12.568 --> 01:04:13.359
That's fair.

01:04:13.401 --> 01:04:14.337
I like pizza. - That's fair.

01:04:14.379 --> 01:04:16.200
- I like pizza.
- I love pizza!

01:04:25.345 --> 01:04:26.808
Foolish mortals.

01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:29.808
You cannot stop the
architects of annihilation.

01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:33.288
The executors of extinction.

01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:36.048
Bow down before your destroyers.

01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:37.523
Or be

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:40.188
destroyed.

01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:42.108
Not so fast, Mohana.

01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:44.808
Take one more step and I push this button.

01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:48.198
Your threats mean nothing to me, Krogarr.

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.998
Now put down that toy.

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.798
And eliminate yourself,

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.404
so I may refrain from lifting my arms.

01:04:55.446 --> 01:04:57.195
Easy, Krogarr,

01:04:57.237 --> 01:05:00.258
you have no idea the power
you're about to unleash.

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.808
Yeah, man. That thing's
hotter than a supernova.

01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:04.354
Don't push it.

01:05:04.396 --> 01:05:05.391
Push it!

01:05:05.433 --> 01:05:08.808
No, don't push it. Push it! Yeah!

01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:11.388
Trust has led to much chaos.

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:13.188
Maybe chainsaw would be best.

01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:16.668
Trust isn't such a
bad thing. I trust you.

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:18.063
Sometimes it works out.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.534
You guys aren't helping much.

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:40.193
I can't believe I'm saying this,

01:05:40.235 --> 01:05:42.258
but can everyone just relax for a second?

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.823
She's right. Everyone relax.

01:05:44.865 --> 01:05:45.698
Nah!

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:47.928
Look, a few minutes ago,

01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:49.998
I'd be the first person
to split a head open

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:50.868
or chop an arm off.

01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:53.260
But I think right now
we need to use our heads.

01:05:54.330 --> 01:05:56.388
I can't help but think we've
been drawn here together

01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:57.588
for a reason.

01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:59.838
That we're meant for something bigger.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.578
We have to figure this out.

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:04.901
And not with our fists,
but with our brains.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:06.783
Our computers,

01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:08.943
our hearts.

01:06:10.830 --> 01:06:14.533
Our hearts.

01:06:17.031 --> 01:06:18.724

Love is the most powerful
force in the universe.

01:08:04.450 --> 01:08:05.950
And what is music?

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.417
Music is love.

01:08:09.342 --> 01:08:11.426
Balderdash!

01:08:19.955 --> 01:08:22.705
Sorry.

01:09:20.107 --> 01:09:23.627
Trog solve. Trog solve.

01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:25.740
Okay Trog, go ahead.

01:09:25.782 --> 01:09:27.999
A bird in the hand,

01:09:28.954 --> 01:09:32.403
worth two in bosh.

01:09:34.896 --> 01:09:37.728
I can't even
believe that. What the hell?

01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:40.784
I'm sorry. But "bosh" is not a word.

01:09:40.826 --> 01:09:42.438
Oh wait, wait. They're telling me...

01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.628
Oh, oh, I guess it is a word!

01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:47.274
Well ladies and gentlemen, how about that?

01:09:48.388 --> 01:09:49.925
What do I know?

01:09:49.967 --> 01:09:51.778
Congratulations Trog.

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:54.018
Doltron, tell them what they've won.

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:56.268
Get ready for fun in the sun!

01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:59.918

paid trip to the planet Earth!
