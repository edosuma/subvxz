WEBVTT

00:00.504 --> 00:03.067
- Here you guys go. Some cookies.
- Wow.

00:03.068 --> 00:04.075
Okay, great. Um,

00:04.075 --> 00:06.057
as you guys know, I'm moving in

00:06.058 --> 00:08.006
with Caroline,
and I'm glad we can

00:08.007 --> 00:09.038
talk about this like adults.

00:09.039 --> 00:12.020
Caroline is, uh,
quite the baker.

00:12.021 --> 00:13.010
Anything else, anyone?

00:13.011 --> 00:14.050
You're making a huge,

00:14.051 --> 00:16.065
life-ruining mistake
by moving in

00:16.067 --> 00:18.016
with a woman
who turned you

00:18.017 --> 00:19.073
into an agoraphobic,

00:19.074 --> 00:21.058
turtle-faced,
borderline alcoholic.

00:22.088 --> 00:24.037
I'm going to start over,

00:24.038 --> 00:26.053
'cause this did not go
the way I had planned.

00:26.554 --> 00:28.992
As you guys know, I'm leaving,
so there are some things

00:28.993 --> 00:31.012
- we need to work out.
- Yeah, like, what am I going to do

00:31.013 --> 00:33.038
with all that extra money I have
now that I don't

00:33.039 --> 00:35.038
- have to cover for you any more?
- Okay.

00:35.041 --> 00:37.050
- Maybe I'll buy a city.
- Oh, and you can open a mall

00:37.053 --> 00:39.012
- And call it Winston's Corners.
- What are you guys doing?

00:39.013 --> 00:40.092
You're just sitting here
and letting this happen?

00:40.093 --> 00:42.016
What else are we
going to do?

00:42.017 --> 00:44.000
The guy obviously
knows what he wants.

00:44.001 --> 00:45.025
- I do.
- When Nick leaves,

00:45.028 --> 00:47.032
I'm going to call a plumber
and just

00:47.033 --> 00:48.079
throw cash at him
while he works.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.087
Fitties and hunnits,
hunnits, hunnits.

00:50.088 --> 00:52.056
Look, while you're at it, can
you please call an exterminator

00:52.057 --> 00:54.036
so we can get rid
of that crime against nature?

00:54.037 --> 00:55.079
Yeah, he's
not fooling anyone.

00:55.080 --> 00:57.074
You think, just 'cause he's

00:57.075 --> 00:59.031
a snappy dresser,
the mice don't see the hammer?

00:59.032 --> 01:00.075
Mice come
from all over the building

01:00.076 --> 01:02.041
to laugh at that dummy witch.

01:02.042 --> 01:04.007
Is this a freaking carob chip?

01:04.007 --> 01:05.015
What, are you trying
to buy our love

01:05.016 --> 01:06.079
with hippie chocolate?

01:06.080 --> 01:08.020
You idiot.

01:08.021 --> 01:10.082
Aren't you going to
miss this, Nick?

Winston, can you take me
to the doctor tomorrow?

01:20.022 --> 01:22.012
- He's taking the bandages off.
- Wow.

01:22.013 --> 01:23.083
The old Washington
Monument.

01:23.084 --> 01:26.016
Ready to serve this
great nation once again.

01:26.017 --> 01:27.067
- Can you stop?
- What?

01:27.068 --> 01:29.052
It's time to make this
horse into a unicorn.

01:29.053 --> 01:31.036
Can we save this talk
until after we're done

01:31.037 --> 01:32.998
interviewing Neil here
to take Nick's room?

01:32.999 --> 01:34.088
Hey, don't worry about me.

01:34.089 --> 01:37.020
I could talk about my dingus
all night long.

01:37.021 --> 01:39.060
Neil, tell us about yourself--
you know, uh, anything

01:39.061 --> 01:41.002
we should know,
aside from the fact

01:41.003 --> 01:43.096
that you responded
to our Craigslist ad with a fax?

01:43.097 --> 01:46.003
Well, um, yeah, my name is Neil.

01:46.004 --> 01:49.074
Um, just coming out
of a pretty hairy divorce.

01:49.075 --> 01:51.020
I am in
human resources.

01:51.021 --> 01:52.054
Well, I used to be.

01:52.055 --> 01:54.003
I had the unique, uh, experience

01:54.004 --> 01:56.053
of having to let myself go.

01:56.054 --> 01:59.067
- I did not take it well.
- Let me ask you a question.

01:59.068 --> 02:01.094
I would love for you to save
your questions till the end.

02:01.095 --> 02:03.075
Are you going to be
a wuss about things

02:03.076 --> 02:06.017
- like crabs and bedbugs?
- Like, crabs from Maine?

02:06.018 --> 02:08.062
I hope you like feminist rants,
'cause that's kind of my thing.

02:08.062 --> 02:10.095
Neil, she's just saying this
to scare you.

02:10.096 --> 02:12.062
What are you...

02:12.065 --> 02:14.021
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

02:14.024 --> 02:16.007
I'm a cutter.

02:16.008 --> 02:18.016
Neil, uh, I want you
to give us a minute, okay?

02:18.017 --> 02:19.054
I got to go talk
to my roommates

02:19.055 --> 02:21.012
in the bathroom. Guys? - Okay.
Yeah.

02:21.013 --> 02:22.046
You're acting insane.

02:22.047 --> 02:25.016
I'm acting insane?
That guy's insane.

02:25.017 --> 02:27.054
Look, Jess, when you moved in,
we all had to roll with it.

02:27.055 --> 02:30.011
To be fair, you do some
pretty weird stuff.

02:30.012 --> 02:31.998
You know, I still can't
get used to the way

02:31.999 --> 02:33.092
you let us know
when you're using the toilet.

02:37.029 --> 02:39.011
I'm good with Neil.

02:39.012 --> 02:41.033
- I am, too.
- What are you guys doing?

02:41.036 --> 02:43.011
Nick's leaving.

02:43.012 --> 02:44.083
You're his friends.

02:44.084 --> 02:47.011
Aren't you going to fight
for him to stay?

02:47.012 --> 02:48.070
You're in.

02:48.071 --> 02:50.011
Ah, yes! Okay.

02:50.012 --> 02:51.092
And get ready for songs,

02:51.093 --> 02:54.045
'cause I am kind of
a troubadour.

02:54.046 --> 02:57.007
This is happening, Nick.
This is happening.

02:57.008 --> 02:58.983
Whoa, whoa! Why you
taking back your lamp?

02:58.984 --> 03:00.024
I think you just
answered that

03:00.025 --> 03:02.020
when you called
it my lamp.

03:02.021 --> 03:04.016
No, man.
Squatters' rights.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.083
What's wrong?
You still afraid of the dark?

03:05.084 --> 03:07.016
What? No. Dude.

03:07.017 --> 03:08.021
'Cause, if you are,

03:08.022 --> 03:10.003
I'll leave this behind.

03:10.004 --> 03:11.998
Nick, first of all,
I'm not afraid of the dark.

03:11.999 --> 03:13.054
But if I were afraid
of the dark,

03:13.055 --> 03:14.999
that would be a
totally rational,

03:15.000 --> 03:17.016
adaptive evolutionary response.

03:17.017 --> 03:18.038
- Good night, Winston.
- That's ridiculous.

03:18.039 --> 03:19.096
I'm not afraid of the dark.

03:19.097 --> 03:21.082
Good night, sweetheart.

03:21.083 --> 03:24.057
Unless the monsters get you.

03:29.058 --> 03:31.041
Hey.

03:31.042 --> 03:33.049
You came.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.053
Whoa.

03:36.054 --> 03:37.999
What you got in there?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.008
It's a hard cast.

03:39.009 --> 03:41.016
Yeah, things
didn't go

03:41.017 --> 03:43.016
quite like we had hoped
at the doctor.

03:43.017 --> 03:45.019
Yeah, so I told the guy
I had never been snowmobiling

03:45.020 --> 03:46.033
in my life,
you know, and...

03:46.034 --> 03:48.999
Oh, God!

03:49.000 --> 03:50.008
That's not my penis.

03:50.009 --> 03:52.007
But look,
on the bright side,

03:52.008 --> 03:54.015
it is impossible for me
to get aroused in this thing.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.071
Here, watch--
say something hot to me.

03:57.075 --> 04:01.017
Fresh-pressed linens.

04:02.071 --> 04:04.087
Nope, nothing.

04:04.088 --> 04:06.020
Not an inch.

04:06.021 --> 04:08.017
- Like a swaddled baby.
- Hey, Cece.

04:08.020 --> 04:10.008
- They're ready for us.
- Oh, okay.

04:10.011 --> 04:12.000
Just hang out, okay?
Have fun.

04:16.083 --> 04:18.024
That's right. Ride that missile.

04:18.026 --> 04:19.087
Grip it. Yeah.

04:19.088 --> 04:21.060
You've got a whole
tank full of jet fuel.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.008
You're heading
straight for the sun.

04:23.009 --> 04:25.011
What the hell war is this?

04:25.012 --> 04:27.004
- All right, turn around and face him.
- Am-am I...

04:27.005 --> 04:28.067
Am I supposed
to want to buy a missile?

04:28.068 --> 04:30.041
I don't understand.

04:30.042 --> 04:32.003
Just pounding the drum of war.

04:32.004 --> 04:34.083
What-what, did no one
listen to Eisenhower?

04:36.004 --> 04:37.065
All right,
so that's everything.

04:37.066 --> 04:39.046
I took my fair share
of rubber bands,

04:39.047 --> 04:41.028
so I don't want
to hear about it.

04:41.029 --> 04:43.049
In my room,
you will find a shoe box.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.007
In that box,
there is a guinea pig

04:46.008 --> 04:47.999
that I said I would bury,

04:48.000 --> 04:50.008
- so please deal with it.
- There's a corpse in your room?

04:50.009 --> 04:51.069
All right, guys, well,
thanks for helping me move.

04:51.070 --> 04:53.006
What are we standing
in a circle for,

04:53.007 --> 04:54.017
like a bunch
of weirdos? Let's go.

04:54.018 --> 04:55.020
Hey, Nick?

04:55.021 --> 04:56.091
Yeah.

04:56.092 --> 04:58.024
Why are you rushing this?

04:58.025 --> 04:59.071
You have so
much time.

04:59.072 --> 05:01.011
Why not just...

05:01.012 --> 05:03.028
take a second and
think about this?

05:03.029 --> 05:04.073
I feel confident.

05:04.074 --> 05:06.038
I-I couldn't be
more confident, Jess.

05:06.039 --> 05:09.050
- Are you?
- Yeah.

05:09.053 --> 05:11.046
- Are you?
- Yes.

05:11.047 --> 05:12.075
Are you really?

05:12.576 --> 05:14.067
Thanks for helping me move.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.074

05:27.096 --> 05:31.003
I love the way
he smelled.

05:31.004 --> 05:33.999
Caroline and I are starting
a whole new life together.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.050
Right now, we're
trying to decide

05:35.051 --> 05:38.057
between eggshell and
soft mint for the walls.

05:38.058 --> 05:41.091
My gut says that eggshell
is trying too hard,

05:41.092 --> 05:45.011
but soft mint is really
tricky to match.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.071
Have I told you guys about the
bay windows I'm going to have?

05:46.072 --> 05:48.021
- Yes, you have.
- Yeah, you just did.

05:48.022 --> 05:49.096
They are stunning, right?

05:49.097 --> 05:54.003
I'm going to curl up
in those like a damn cat.

05:54.004 --> 05:56.092
- That's the place.
- That's-that'sthe place right there?

05:56.095 --> 05:57.999
Right there, yeah.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.054
Aren't you going to stop?

05:59.055 --> 06:01.016
Yeah, seems like I should.

06:01.017 --> 06:02.067
Um, hey-hey, Nick.

06:02.068 --> 06:04.000
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

06:04.003 --> 06:07.046
- I'm freaking out! Yeah!
- What are you...?

06:07.049 --> 06:09.007
Oh, no.

06:09.008 --> 06:10.075
Oh, Nick Miller's
freaking out again!

06:10.076 --> 06:12.003
Whoop-de-whoo.

06:12.004 --> 06:13.000
What's new?

06:20.021 --> 06:21.582
Come on!

06:21.583 --> 06:22.560
What the hell?
You think he's okay, man?

06:22.561 --> 06:24.510
Oh, no, no, no,
he's totally fine.

06:24.511 --> 06:25.544
We do this every day.

06:25.545 --> 06:27.504
We just never invite
you, Winston.

06:28.508 --> 06:29.515
What have I done?!

06:29.516 --> 06:31.504
Hey, Nick,
I'm pretty sure

06:31.505 --> 06:34.524
you overshot the apartment
by like 140 miles!

06:34.525 --> 06:35.567
Let's just hop
back in the truck,

06:35.568 --> 06:37.532
turn around
and go home.

06:37.533 --> 06:40.567
Yeah, yeah, you're right. - Okay?
Okay.

06:40.570 --> 06:43.504
- This is crazy that I drove out here.
- Yeah, it is.

06:43.505 --> 06:45.546
Give me the keys.
I'll drive you back to Caroline.

06:45.547 --> 06:47.587
Caroline... no!

06:48.988 --> 06:51.520
Well, that was
unexpected.

06:51.521 --> 06:54.503
♪ I like to move in, move in,
I like to move in, move in ♪

06:54.504 --> 06:56.503

06:56.504 --> 06:57.524

06:57.525 --> 07:00.504
I like it quiet, quiet.

07:02.512 --> 07:03.550
Okay, I rode up

07:03.551 --> 07:05.511
in the elevator with that guy,

07:05.512 --> 07:07.532
and something growled
in that box.

07:07.533 --> 07:09.553
I hope he has a pet.
That would cheer me up.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.511
Um, is Schmidt here?

07:11.512 --> 07:13.520
No, he's helping Nick
move-- but, uh, Neil is.

07:13.521 --> 07:15.566
Do you want to do a
sex-only thing with him?

07:15.567 --> 07:19.591
He came by my shoot earlier
and was so jealous.

07:19.592 --> 07:22.553
He was freaking out
the entire time.

07:22.554 --> 07:24.512
Oh.

07:24.513 --> 07:25.583
It's him, so...

07:26.584 --> 07:27.574
Hi, Schmidt.

07:27.575 --> 07:29.507
How's it going?

07:29.508 --> 07:30.573
How's the new apartment?

07:30.574 --> 07:32.588
Does it smell like, uh,
new paint and compromise?

07:33.089 --> 07:34.499
What?

07:34.500 --> 07:35.566
Where?

07:35.567 --> 07:37.533
- There's not much sunlight left.
- What are you

07:37.536 --> 07:39.596
- afraid of, the dark?
- No, I'm not afraid of the dark.

07:39.597 --> 07:41.596
Worried about Schmidt.
He's a Jew in the desert.

07:41.597 --> 07:43.554
I don't want him to wander.

07:43.557 --> 07:45.570
That's Caroline.
Now, what do I tell her?

07:45.571 --> 07:47.591
Tell her there's
freaking fire ants everywhere.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.511
Give me a sec.

07:49.512 --> 07:50.566
Hey.

07:50.567 --> 07:51.567
Nick, where are you?

07:51.568 --> 07:52.591
In the desert.

07:52.592 --> 07:54.499
The what?

07:54.500 --> 07:55.521
Yeah, I kind of...

07:55.522 --> 07:57.570
I kind of freaked out.

07:57.571 --> 08:00.578
Look, I know it's a lot.

08:00.579 --> 08:02.520
Just get back here

08:02.521 --> 08:04.532
as soon as you can,
and we'll...

08:04.533 --> 08:06.499
we'll figure it out.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.562
Really?

08:08.063 --> 08:10.511
I love you.

08:10.512 --> 08:11.596
I love you, too.

08:17.575 --> 08:19.591
Think I overreacted
by throwing my keys earlier.

08:19.592 --> 08:21.521
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. I don't know why

08:21.524 --> 08:23.537
I ever doubted Caroline.
She's the best.

08:23.538 --> 08:25.771
So, why the hell would you throw
your damn keys away?!

08:25.772 --> 08:26.571
I deserve this.

08:26.574 --> 08:29.504
- I'm going to kill you!
- Hey, Winston, no.

08:29.507 --> 08:31.550
- The sun is going down!
- All right, all right.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.529
- Calm down. Nick!
- I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

08:33.532 --> 08:35.520
Enough!

08:35.522 --> 08:37.515
Would you stop it?
There's violence everywhere!

08:37.515 --> 08:38.596
Why are we fighting?
Why are we fighting?

08:41.549 --> 08:42.515
Oh, good.

08:42.517 --> 08:43.570
Oh, thank God.

08:43.571 --> 08:45.511
Hey, Jess!

08:45.512 --> 08:46.540
What took you so long?

08:46.541 --> 08:47.592
Let me tell you something--
you never want

08:47.593 --> 08:49.520
to lose a race
against the night.

08:49.521 --> 08:51.511
Nice new place, Nick.

08:51.512 --> 08:52.579
- It's very spacious.
- Yes, I'm an idiot, Jess.

08:52.582 --> 08:54.517
- Really nice.
- Hey.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.516
That's for you.

08:56.517 --> 08:57.519
What happened
at the shoot?

08:57.520 --> 08:58.552
You... you kind of left

08:58.553 --> 09:00.510
before I had a chance
to say good-bye.

09:00.511 --> 09:01.536
Good stuff, sure.

09:01.537 --> 09:03.521
It was hard to tell
where you stopped

09:03.522 --> 09:05.561
and Goggles McHardBody began.

09:05.562 --> 09:07.520
That's my job.

09:07.521 --> 09:09.583
Gino is just some guy
that I see around the office,

09:09.584 --> 09:11.587
except for, in my office,
they rub us down

09:11.588 --> 09:14.508
- with baby oil before we start.
- Yeah, I-I get that.

09:14.511 --> 09:16.541
Look, your business
is selling sex.

09:16.542 --> 09:19.499
Sure, you're
a sex worker.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.571
You're an idiot.

09:20.572 --> 09:22.507
If we leave right now,

09:22.508 --> 09:23.558
I can get back
to Caroline by 8:00.

09:23.559 --> 09:25.520
Caroline?

09:25.521 --> 09:27.566
Yeah, I-I changed my mind.
Gonna move in.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.519
Yeah, and I actually don't
even care about this truck.

09:29.520 --> 09:30.540
I'll come back
and get it tomorrow.

09:30.541 --> 09:31.571
I say we just leave now,

09:31.572 --> 09:33.504
- get out of the desert.
- Sounds good.

09:33.507 --> 09:34.567
- Sounds good.
- Here's my question.

09:34.570 --> 09:36.546
- What's that?
- How are you going to get there?

09:36.547 --> 09:38.498
Uh, I think you're
going to drive me.

09:38.499 --> 09:39.588
- Oh, I don't think so.
- Wait. What?

09:39.589 --> 09:41.546
- Then why'd you come out to the desert?
- What?!

09:41.549 --> 09:43.508
- What? What are you doing?
- Jess.

09:43.511 --> 09:44.546
- Jess!
- No!

09:44.549 --> 09:46.507
Come on!

09:46.508 --> 09:47.562
People, just please
listen to me.

09:47.563 --> 09:50.520
Stop throwing
your damn keys!

09:50.521 --> 09:52.510
The werewolves
come out at night, man.

09:52.511 --> 09:53.592
I don't want
nobody to eat me!

09:53.593 --> 09:56.538
- I got big thighs. I got a fat ass.
- Relax.

09:56.539 --> 09:58.498
We are in the middle
of the desert, and nobody

09:58.499 --> 09:59.571
- is going to find our bodies!
- Come here.

09:59.574 --> 10:01.508
- What?
- You're having a nervous breakdown.

10:01.511 --> 10:02.525
You're having a nervous breakdown.

10:04.079 --> 10:05.565
The tow truck can't come
until tomorrow.

10:05.566 --> 10:07.525
Aren't you glad
I stole all this beer?

10:07.526 --> 10:10.521
- Hello. Look what I found.
- Don't. Put that away.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.071
- No, I have to hear it.
- I-I'm begging you

10:12.072 --> 10:14.056
to put that away.
It's humiliating.

10:14.057 --> 10:15.088
I made that
when I was 14.

10:15.089 --> 10:17.049
Nick, I have to hear this.

10:17.050 --> 10:20.008
This next song - Turn it up.
No, please...

10:20.011 --> 10:22.020
Goes out to a very special girl,
Gwen Bressler.

10:22.021 --> 10:24.083
I know you like breakfast,
but how do you feel about...

10:24.084 --> 10:26.025
- "Breakfast at Tiffany's"?
- "Breakfast at Tiffany's."

10:26.028 --> 10:28.007
Oh, that is a terrible song.

10:28.008 --> 10:30.012
This is a great song.

10:30.013 --> 10:31.079
You guys are crazy.
Listen to the lyrics.

10:31.080 --> 10:34.024
Oh, man.
I feel it in my body.

10:34.025 --> 10:36.003
Oh...

10:36.004 --> 10:39.066
Are you kidding me?
This is in my bones.

10:39.067 --> 10:41.999

Breakfast at Tiffany's"?♪

10:53.521 --> 10:57.499
Oh, yes, this is where Nick
got cool again.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.558
Oh, not you, too.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.566

11:28.592 --> 11:30.504
making fun of Nick.

11:32.508 --> 11:33.554
Okay.

11:37.338 --> 11:38.566
All right, I did it.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.499
I'm an idiot.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.554
I see what you guys are doing.

11:41.555 --> 11:43.528
I get it.

11:43.529 --> 11:45.506
You're trying to force me
to remember how great it is

11:45.507 --> 11:46.592
when we're all hanging out
so I don't want to leave.

11:46.593 --> 11:48.533
- We're just having fun.
- I get it.

11:48.534 --> 11:50.502
You guys think I'm dumb
and I make bad decisions,

11:50.503 --> 11:51.525
- but this isn't that.
- No.

11:51.528 --> 11:52.578
What? Come on.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.502
You're being crazy.
Where are you going?

11:54.503 --> 11:55.533
- To get my keys.
- Dude, where you going?

11:55.534 --> 11:56.592
You're never gonna
find your keys.

12:00.575 --> 12:03.499
What's wrong with you?

12:03.500 --> 12:04.567
You're stress-eating meat.

12:04.568 --> 12:06.524
Hey, Jess.

12:06.525 --> 12:07.567
How many have you had?

12:07.568 --> 12:08.587
Like, three.

12:08.588 --> 12:10.520
That's a lot of pig parts.

12:10.521 --> 12:11.540
It's just Cece.

12:11.541 --> 12:13.567
I thought it was going
so well between you guys.

12:13.568 --> 12:14.595
Yeah.

12:14.596 --> 12:16.579
You know, she's a good egg.

12:18.588 --> 12:20.567
She's never gonna be happy
with somebody like me, Jess.

12:20.568 --> 12:22.532
What? That's crazy.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.498
That's why I'm gonna
have to White Fang her.

12:24.499 --> 12:25.554
Schmidt, come on!

12:25.555 --> 12:27.561
Look, I try not to
judge what you guys do,

12:27.562 --> 12:29.542
but please don't tell
me things like that.

12:29.543 --> 12:31.545
No, no, Jess, Jess.

12:31.546 --> 12:33.566
The book: White Fang.

12:33.567 --> 12:35.504
- Oh.
- This guy

12:35.507 --> 12:37.532
Befriends a wild creature.

12:37.533 --> 12:39.541
But he must, he must
set the animal free

12:39.542 --> 12:41.498
because that's
what's best for it.

12:41.499 --> 12:42.523
I know the plot
of White Fang.

12:42.524 --> 12:43.523
But the animal won't go.

12:43.524 --> 12:44.583
So with a breaking heart,

12:44.584 --> 12:47.503
he throws stones at it
until it runs away.

12:47.504 --> 12:49.524
You-you want
Cece to go away?

12:49.525 --> 12:52.503
No.

12:52.504 --> 12:54.587
I want her to be happy.

12:54.588 --> 12:57.511
'Cause when-when you care
about somebody,

12:57.512 --> 12:59.528
you do what's-what's best
for them.

12:59.529 --> 13:02.529
Even if it sucks for you.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.566
Even if they're just a "woof."

13:06.567 --> 13:07.591
A wolf?

13:07.592 --> 13:09.521
- A "woof."
- A wolf.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.548
Yeah, that's what I said,
a "woof."

13:10.549 --> 13:11.596
A wolf.

13:11.597 --> 13:13.511
A "woof."

13:13.512 --> 13:14.541
Come on, keys.

13:14.542 --> 13:15.565
Hey, Nick?

13:15.566 --> 13:16.573
Come on, they could be anywhere.

13:16.574 --> 13:17.583
Let's come back in the morning.

13:17.584 --> 13:19.999
I don't want to come back
in the morning, Jess.

13:20.000 --> 13:20.992
Okay, I want to be

13:20.993 --> 13:23.545
in my new bed,
in my new apartment,

13:23.546 --> 13:25.511
with my new old girlfriend.

13:25.512 --> 13:27.541
Okay, just-- look,
I know I've been--

13:27.542 --> 13:29.503
What?

13:29.504 --> 13:31.507
Oh, my God.

13:31.508 --> 13:33.591
Shh-shh. Shh.

13:37.029 --> 13:38.091
Oh, my God.

13:38.592 --> 13:39.507
Okay, just be cool.

13:39.508 --> 13:40.565
What do we do?
What do we do?

13:40.566 --> 13:42.502
I don't know, I don't
know what to do!

13:42.503 --> 13:44.550
Okay, but, Jess, we have
to do something!   - Shh.

13:47.025 --> 13:48.070
Meep-meep!

13:48.071 --> 13:49.567
- What are you doing?
- Like the Road Runner.

13:49.568 --> 13:50.583
I know it's like
the Road Runner.

13:50.584 --> 13:52.507
Why would you
do the Road Runner?

13:52.508 --> 13:53.554
- Because he's...
- Don't do that, Jess.

13:53.557 --> 13:55.500
- Meep-meep!
- Jess, honestly,

13:55.503 --> 13:57.516
Don't do the Road Runner
to a coyote!

13:57.517 --> 13:58.575
That's how you
deal with coyotes.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.516
Coyotes hate roadrunners!

14:00.517 --> 14:01.506
That's how you
deal with them.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.538
Coyotes want to
kill roadrunners!

14:04.521 --> 14:05.520
Meep-meep!

14:05.521 --> 14:06.520
Oh, you...

14:08.562 --> 14:10.520
No disrespect.

14:10.521 --> 14:13.550
It's watching us.
It's watching us.

14:20.521 --> 14:21.562
We need to talk.

14:21.563 --> 14:22.582
All right.

14:22.583 --> 14:24.541
This is not another
one of those

14:24.542 --> 14:26.500
"merlot is the whore of the
vineyard" talks, is it?

14:26.501 --> 14:28.516
This isn't working out.

14:29.517 --> 14:32.516
Are you kidding... right now?

14:32.517 --> 14:34.521
Are you trying
to end this with me?

14:45.529 --> 14:47.550
Now go on!

14:49.504 --> 14:50.507
You heard me!

14:50.508 --> 14:51.511
Go on!

14:51.512 --> 14:52.557
Go on, scram!

14:52.558 --> 14:53.570
Go!

14:53.571 --> 14:55.541
I hate you! Go!

14:59.542 --> 15:01.503
Go back to your kind!

15:01.504 --> 15:02.546
Are you White Fanging me?

15:02.547 --> 15:03.549
Sorry, what?

15:03.550 --> 15:06.541
White Fang, Schmidt.

15:06.542 --> 15:08.528
The only book on your Kindle.

15:08.529 --> 15:10.502
The one that you wouldn't
stop talking about.

15:10.503 --> 15:11.542
Remember, I
said, "Please,"

15:11.543 --> 15:13.520
stop talking about White Fang."

15:13.521 --> 15:16.524
And you said, "Someday,
I'm gonna do this to somebody."

15:16.525 --> 15:18.503
That White Fang. Uh-huh.

15:19.504 --> 15:21.521
Why are you trying
to push me away?

15:23.500 --> 15:25.570
I saw your phone, Cece.

15:25.571 --> 15:28.524
I saw the text message
from Gino.

15:28.525 --> 15:30.507
Your colleague.

15:30.508 --> 15:31.542
You went through my phone?

15:31.543 --> 15:32.591
What? No.

15:32.592 --> 15:34.571
Winston... Winston
went through your phone.

15:34.572 --> 15:37.549
That is not okay.

15:37.550 --> 15:41.507
This is about trust,
Schmidt, okay?

15:41.508 --> 15:42.548
It's about trust.

15:42.549 --> 15:44.527
And I told you how
this was gonna be,

15:44.528 --> 15:46.498
and I asked you to
get okay with it.

15:46.499 --> 15:47.562
How am I supposed
to trust you, Cece?

15:47.563 --> 15:49.524
You slept with me.

15:49.525 --> 15:51.525
I mean, that doesn't say much
about your taste in men.

16:02.533 --> 16:05.532
And I have more than one book
on my Kindle.

16:05.533 --> 16:08.503
And a subscription to Cricket.

16:08.504 --> 16:10.516
And a lot of PDFs!

16:11.571 --> 16:13.507
Doesn't he have
somewhere to be?

16:13.508 --> 16:15.499
Well, this is a disaster.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.029
Why did you
keep driving?

16:17.030 --> 16:18.527
I don't want to talk
to you about this, Jess.

16:18.528 --> 16:20.567
I know what you're gonna say,
and I don't want to hear it.

16:20.568 --> 16:22.566
No.

16:22.567 --> 16:25.512
No, you don't know
what I'm gonna say.

16:26.517 --> 16:29.516
I want you to be happy.

16:29.517 --> 16:32.516
And if that means
moving in with Caroline,

16:32.517 --> 16:34.517
then I think you should do it.

16:37.054 --> 16:38.554
That's what you think?

16:40.512 --> 16:41.575
I think you need me too much.

16:41.576 --> 16:43.537
No, I'm gonna be fine. I am.

16:43.538 --> 16:44.529
I don't think so.

16:44.530 --> 16:47.525
- You know why?
- Why?

16:48.028 --> 16:49.525
'Cause I met you.

16:52.938 --> 16:54.592
That's why I'm okay.

16:58.575 --> 16:59.524
That's why

16:59.995 --> 17:02.016
I can do this.

17:02.017 --> 17:03.503
What are you doing?

17:03.504 --> 17:06.936
To beat the coyote,
you have to be the coyote.

17:07.038 --> 17:08.537
That's what I thought
you were gonna say.

17:08.538 --> 17:09.588
That's a very dumb idea.
Don't do this.

17:09.589 --> 17:11.523
I'm not with her on this.

17:11.525 --> 17:12.554
This is her move, not mine, sir.

17:15.526 --> 17:16.523
No.

17:23.538 --> 17:25.503
- Oh, my God.
- I did it!

17:25.507 --> 17:27.499
Oh, my God.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.502
I did it! I have so much dirt
in my mouth, and I did it!

17:29.503 --> 17:30.596
- Come here, come here.
- I did it!

17:30.597 --> 17:31.596
Nice job!

17:31.597 --> 17:32.596
I did it!

17:36.579 --> 17:39.520
Oh, my God. Schmidt?

17:39.521 --> 17:40.520
Hello?

17:40.521 --> 17:41.531
Winston?

17:41.532 --> 17:42.552
Oh, my goodness!

17:42.553 --> 17:43.588
Oh, my goodness!

17:43.589 --> 17:46.533
- Oh... my goodness!
- He'll be fine.

17:49.504 --> 17:50.587
I don't know.

17:50.588 --> 17:52.523
You guys want
some candy or something?

17:52.524 --> 17:53.546
Found it in the truck.

17:53.547 --> 17:54.561
No.

17:54.562 --> 17:56.503
I don't want
your dirty lolly.

17:56.504 --> 17:57.521
Guys!

17:57.522 --> 17:58.562
- Ah!
- Whoo!

17:58.563 --> 17:59.567
I survived, man.

18:00.568 --> 18:02.516
I made it out alive.

18:02.517 --> 18:03.588
- Wait, wait, don't touch me.
- Don't touch...

18:03.589 --> 18:04.596
There's, uh,
there's pee everywhere.

18:04.597 --> 18:07.499
Like... everywhere.

18:07.500 --> 18:08.519
It's everywhere?

18:08.520 --> 18:09.552
Well, I didn't just pee on me.

18:09.553 --> 18:10.590
I peed-- well, I peed on me,

18:10.591 --> 18:12.588
but other-other things
peed on me, too.

18:12.589 --> 18:14.566
I saw things, man.

18:14.567 --> 18:16.587
I had an experience.

18:16.588 --> 18:19.511
I think I made out with
the side of a dune.

18:19.512 --> 18:20.574
Hey!

18:20.575 --> 18:22.503
Look, I found my keys!

18:22.504 --> 18:23.542
Ah! Thank God!

18:30.583 --> 18:32.520
We still on for brunch?

18:32.521 --> 18:34.502
Gonna come help me
unload my stuff tomorrow?

18:34.503 --> 18:35.512
No, not a chance.

18:35.513 --> 18:37.512
No, yeah, so we can't do brunch.

18:48.554 --> 18:50.503
Just go.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.512
Get in the car.

18:53.521 --> 18:55.520
Unacceptable.

18:55.521 --> 18:57.529
Good luck.

19:04.092 --> 19:05.557
Well...

19:05.558 --> 19:07.592
Well...

19:10.096 --> 19:12.500
All right, I'll see you.

19:16.504 --> 19:17.571
See ya.

19:29.517 --> 19:30.591
Wow.

19:30.592 --> 19:33.557
Look how pronounced
Nick's couch hole got.

19:33.558 --> 19:35.520
All this time

19:35.521 --> 19:36.562
I thought he was
just sitting here

19:36.563 --> 19:38.537
drinking beer
and complaining,

19:38.538 --> 19:39.583
he was making
something.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.041
Hey.

19:53.542 --> 19:55.521
What do you think?

20:21.950 --> 20:23.999
Hey, WNICK listeners,

20:24.000 --> 20:25.583
this one is going out
to all the ladies

20:25.584 --> 20:27.532

20:27.533 --> 20:29.511
Not.

20:42.558 --> 20:45.554

20:48.558 --> 20:52.504
