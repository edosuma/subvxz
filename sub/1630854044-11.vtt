[narrator] <i> Previously</i>
<i> on</i>  Queen Sugar.

00:02.911 --> 00:04.119
I was in a tent in the Sudan,
desperate to know
how you were,

00:04.121 --> 00:06.714
and you were here
with your ex-cop boyfriend

00:06.790 --> 00:08.298
<i> that's the love of your life</i>

00:08.300 --> 00:09.425
Talked to Blue this morning.

00:09.427 --> 00:10.968
Maybe we should tell him.

00:10.970 --> 00:12.344
<i> I mean, everything comes ou</i>
<i> eventually, Darla.</i>

00:12.346 --> 00:14.096
Not now.

00:14.098 --> 00:16.515
<i> If we can find</i>
<i> a pattern of corruption,</i>

00:16.592 --> 00:17.683
<i> we can build a case.</i>

00:17.685 --> 00:19.935
You're hiding so many secrets.

00:19.937 --> 00:22.312
Look, everybody
agrees this is skids.

00:22.314 --> 00:25.232
Whether or not Betty Flynn
has anything to do with this.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.693
<i> She would stop it</i>
<i> if she could.</i>

00:27.695 --> 00:29.528
It's best I do this on my own.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.330
-Hi, Betty.
-Vi!

00:40.958 --> 00:42.416
Oh, my God. Is that you?

00:43.002 --> 00:44.543
What are you doing here?

00:45.046 --> 00:46.545
I needed to see you.

00:47.298 --> 00:49.590
I needed to look
into your eyes

00:49.592 --> 00:52.926
and know that you were still
the woman I knew.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.846
Betty, I need your help.

00:57.349 --> 00:58.599
I need you to come home.

00:59.477 --> 01:02.603
Vi, I can't go back there.

01:04.356 --> 01:09.735
You know I would not ask
if it wasn't important.

01:16.077 --> 01:19.828

01:43.479 --> 01:46.814
Yeah, that whole town
turned on me.

01:46.816 --> 01:48.107
Even my own family.

01:48.818 --> 01:51.610
My father, he couldn't
even look at me.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.029
Poor Mama, she just cried.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.532
They all turned
their back on me.

01:56.534 --> 01:58.492
Not me and Ernest.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.953
And you're right.

02:01.029 --> 02:04.039
I would have never made it
out to California
if it wasn't for you two.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.918
Now, Betty, I know

02:07.920 --> 02:10.420
that what I'm asking
for you to do is hard.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.549
But I need you.

02:13.625 --> 02:16.718
Vi's been trying to
reach you for months.

02:16.795 --> 02:20.305
We wouldn't have even came
all the way this way
if it wasn't serious.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.517
Y'all don't understand.

02:23.519 --> 02:26.979
I have not stepped foot
back at that place

02:27.055 --> 02:29.106
since I was
eighteen years old.

02:29.108 --> 02:31.817
Sam's father threatened
to kill us both
if I had the baby.

02:31.894 --> 02:34.027
Y'all were determined.

02:34.989 --> 02:38.490
Wasn't nobody gonna
tell you who you could love.

02:38.492 --> 02:43.162
Vi and Ernest drove us
to another parish
about three hours away

02:43.164 --> 02:44.413
where we got married.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.458
[sighs] We thought that...

02:48.460 --> 02:50.502
...that we were gonna
be together forever.

02:52.047 --> 02:54.089
My grandmother left me
a little piece of land,

02:54.091 --> 02:55.757
so we were gonna
build a house,

02:55.759 --> 02:59.595
and, you know,
start our life together.

02:59.597 --> 03:01.471
[Violet] We were packing up
Betty's suitcase

03:01.473 --> 03:05.809
the day she and Sam were
supposed to leave to go west.

03:06.604 --> 03:09.938
Sam shows up last minute
with a black eye

03:10.858 --> 03:12.399
and a wad of cash.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.485
His daddy beat
the mess out of him.

03:15.487 --> 03:18.822
Threatened to cut him off
if he went with Betty.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.325
Oh, and I begged him.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.161
I begged him to come with me.

03:24.205 --> 03:29.416
But he was more afraid
of being broke
than being with me.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.543
-[Hollywood] Mmm.
-[Violet] Well, one thing
you can say about

03:31.545 --> 03:33.420
that Sam Landry

03:33.422 --> 03:35.297
is that money
didn't change him.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.926
Like that from the day
he was born.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.928
Lord, yes he was.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.182
But, you know,
that was a million years ago.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.784
I mean, it's all in the past.

03:47.786 --> 03:51.605
It ain't in the past
if you and Sam
are still legally married.

03:51.682 --> 03:54.441
-Oh, Vi, that old country
courthouse wedding--
-Still legal.

03:54.443 --> 03:57.736
[Hollywood] Now right now,
your claim to that land,

03:57.738 --> 04:00.697
is the only thing standing
between us and the Landrys.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.825
He wants to bulldoze
over Ernest's farm.

04:06.497 --> 04:07.737
We need your help.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.085
So, where you staying
in the Big Apple?

04:13.161 --> 04:15.545
Uh, my grandma has
an apartment
on the Upper West Side,

04:15.547 --> 04:17.481
so I'm gonna kick it there.

04:17.483 --> 04:19.341
I hear she's setting you up
with some big fund person
or something.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.093
Yeah, there's
this fund manager

04:21.169 --> 04:23.428
that's interested in financing
the NFT Collective.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.721
So...

04:25.307 --> 04:26.381
[Ralph Angel] That's exciting.

04:26.976 --> 04:29.101
You don't sound
excited though.

04:29.177 --> 04:33.355
Last time I went down
this investor route,
it blew up in my face.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.524
It's hard to know
who to trust.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.025
I get it.

04:38.988 --> 04:39.903
All right.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.263
Ready.

04:45.703 --> 04:48.662
I actually wanna
chop with you before
you jet off to New York.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.210
So, what's up?

04:57.464 --> 04:58.714
Can't get him out my head.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.299
Chase?

05:03.095 --> 05:04.511
Can't get him out
of my head either.

05:07.016 --> 05:10.058
I mean, one minute,
I'm back at my house,

05:10.060 --> 05:14.396
dealing with the store,
and the next, here he come,

05:14.473 --> 05:17.274
just messing up my peace.

05:17.276 --> 05:20.110
You feel like you were in
a peaceful place
before that night?

05:20.612 --> 05:22.821
I mean, yeah, mostly.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.282
I don't know.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.326
Got a job that provides,

05:27.328 --> 05:29.036
apartment I could afford,

05:29.580 --> 05:30.954
co-op been booming.

05:31.999 --> 05:35.125
I got Darla, True, and Blue.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.629
You still have
all of those things.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.757
Yeah, but I'm in my head
now, Micah.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.084
About it all.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.845
I mean, how I'm just
supposed to let this man

05:46.847 --> 05:48.513
walk in my house
and do nothing?

05:49.475 --> 05:51.224
I'm supposed to
just let it go?

05:53.520 --> 05:56.188
I mean, you pulled me off him.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.731
Hollywood pulled me
off him, but...

05:58.567 --> 06:00.108
...I still wanna
make him hurt.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.528
I'm supposed to just let him
talk shit about Blue,

06:03.530 --> 06:05.447
like he's nothing,
talking crazy, like...

06:06.200 --> 06:07.366
[shudders]

06:07.442 --> 06:09.117
I could have killed him,
I swear to God.

06:09.194 --> 06:10.994
No, where would that
have left you?

06:11.538 --> 06:13.413
Or the people who love you?

06:13.415 --> 06:15.332
Yeah, but it don't change
how I feel, Micah.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.835
Everybody expect me
to let it go...

06:19.880 --> 06:21.129
...and I'm trying.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.715
But I can't.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.133
That's just how I feel.

06:27.513 --> 06:29.179
Have you talked to
Darla about it, or...

06:29.181 --> 06:30.931
I mean, she put it
all behind her.

06:31.007 --> 06:33.100
I bring it up,
I'm bringing up her pain.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.229
Your pain matters too.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.023
She's your partner.

06:40.192 --> 06:41.349
She loves you.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.319
You should just
chop it up with her.

06:46.824 --> 06:49.366
Is Dominic joining us?

06:49.368 --> 06:54.121
No, he has to help his student
with her thesis presentations.

06:54.197 --> 06:57.999
And did he apologize
for reading your piece?

07:02.631 --> 07:03.630
He did.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.215
We talked it out.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.575
But it still hurts.

07:09.346 --> 07:14.057
He apologized profusely
and I promised
to open up more.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.851
I mean, we've been
together for almost a year

07:15.853 --> 07:19.354
and all that time,
I thought I was really
letting him in.

07:19.431 --> 07:23.733
And I was in my own way,
but I'm still holding back.
I don't know.

07:28.699 --> 07:31.199
Okay, so six months ago,

07:31.276 --> 07:35.912
I thought that it was over
between me and Vince
and then...

07:37.499 --> 07:39.875
...you couldn't have told me
that I was going to

07:39.877 --> 07:43.044
-propose to the man
after Daddy's wedding.
-What?

07:43.121 --> 07:45.672
Girl, and got on one knee!

07:45.674 --> 07:47.424
Billie, are you serious?

07:47.885 --> 07:49.092
Wow!

07:51.054 --> 07:53.555
And he's... It's incredible.

07:53.632 --> 07:56.641
I mean, after all these years
of never wanting to me married
and now...

07:57.519 --> 07:58.727
Nova, now I do.

07:58.729 --> 08:01.021
Life is full of surprises,
isn't it?

08:02.065 --> 08:03.723
Bless you both.

08:03.725 --> 08:06.401
Thank you, girl.
We gonna need all
the blessings we can get.

08:08.363 --> 08:11.490
Well, actually there's
a reunification blessing

08:11.492 --> 08:13.658
that I can do for you
if you like.

08:13.735 --> 08:16.661
Aunt Martha did it
for my folks when they
got back together.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.706
Yeah, I'd really
like that, please.

08:19.708 --> 08:20.740
Well, I'm past due to see her,

08:20.742 --> 08:23.543
so I'll drive
out there tomorrow,

08:23.545 --> 08:26.129
have her remind me
of everything I need
for you and Vince.

08:28.884 --> 08:29.925
Wow.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.511
I'm really happy for you.

08:33.430 --> 08:34.554
Me too.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.101
"I'm here to speak
before the USDA,

08:41.355 --> 08:43.813
about the inequities
in the treatment
of black farmers."

08:44.775 --> 08:46.249
[sighs]

08:47.069 --> 08:49.861
"I'm a fifth generation farmer
from St. Josephine."

08:49.863 --> 08:52.447
"Look, I'm here
to speak before the USDA

08:52.449 --> 08:54.950
about the inequities
of..." [sighs]

08:56.119 --> 08:57.619
[Darla] You're gonna
do great today.

09:00.082 --> 09:02.040
Somebody more
experienced should talk.

09:03.502 --> 09:08.421
You are the very best
person to talk.

09:14.596 --> 09:15.971
I know you're nervous.

09:16.047 --> 09:17.222
But you can do this.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.227
Thank you for being
a good partner.

09:23.689 --> 09:26.731
That is a very lovely thing
to hear out of nowhere.

09:27.651 --> 09:30.360
Thank you for being the same.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.532
I'll be sensitive sometimes.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.117
Sometimes.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.829
This Chase thing...

09:42.082 --> 09:43.415
...still got me messed up.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.629
I feel bad bringing it up.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.132
But I feel like I need
to let you know.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.218
I'm still not past it.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.430
We have the paperwork.

09:59.725 --> 10:01.433
We are free and clear of him.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.228
Please forget him.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.855
So, you don't wanna
make him pay?

10:08.233 --> 10:09.608
For what he did to you?

10:09.684 --> 10:11.501
I don't need that.

10:11.503 --> 10:14.321
And you ain't worried
about him being
in the same city as Blue?

10:14.323 --> 10:16.531
He wants nothing to do
with Blue, you heard him.

10:18.327 --> 10:20.327
And that ain't make you feel
some type of way?

10:21.371 --> 10:23.747
Him talking about
my little man
like he's nothing?

10:23.790 --> 10:26.833
It infuriated me, of course.

10:27.586 --> 10:30.295
But not as much as
him saying he wants Blue

10:31.006 --> 10:32.756
and the nightmare
that that would be.

10:32.758 --> 10:34.633
We cannot have it both ways.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.052
Got an answer
for everything, huh?

10:37.128 --> 10:38.094
Excuse me?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.013
Forget about it.

10:40.090 --> 10:41.306
Don't do that.

10:41.383 --> 10:44.726
-It's all good.
-Ralph Angel, don't do that.

10:44.728 --> 10:47.312
-If you're gonna
start something, finish it.
-I'm finished.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.531
All right, you good?
You got your stats?

10:58.533 --> 10:59.449
Got it.

10:59.451 --> 11:00.575
Tell our story.

11:00.577 --> 11:01.826
Yes, sir.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.914
You know, all I did
to try and help you people

11:05.916 --> 11:08.166
and you gonna
pull a stunt like this.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.418
No stunt, it's just facts.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.128
Well, good luck in here,
you're gonna need it.

11:14.299 --> 11:15.924
Hey!

11:15.926 --> 11:18.510
[indistinct chatter]

11:18.586 --> 11:22.222
See, they got
a whole little club.

11:22.298 --> 11:24.391
They take care of each other
and make it worse for us.

11:25.227 --> 11:26.226
[scoffs]

11:30.315 --> 11:31.431
Can I have a word?

11:34.361 --> 11:36.444
I just wanna share
one thing with you.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.946
Forget them white people.

11:39.741 --> 11:42.200
You're standing for us,
for yourself.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.035
For your father.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.498
Ernest would be so proud
of you right now.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.166
He is proud.

11:50.168 --> 11:53.211
He always knew that you would
grow into being the man

11:53.246 --> 11:56.131
that you were meant to be
and here you are.

11:58.135 --> 12:00.802
And just speak
from your heart.

12:02.431 --> 12:04.514
Speak for your father.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.730
Come on.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.444
So, what is the last time
you saw my daughter?

12:19.531 --> 12:22.240
Parker was at
the council meeting

12:22.242 --> 12:28.079
convincing them to overturn
the landmark on Ernest's farm.

12:28.081 --> 12:33.877
Dig up our ancestors' remains,
her ancestors' remains.

12:33.879 --> 12:37.630
Oh, Lord. I don't know
who she is anymore.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.092
This, this "Parker" character
that she created.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.888
The name on that child's
birth certificate
is Imani Arsenault

12:44.890 --> 12:48.099
But you know what?
Sam got into her mind.

12:48.101 --> 12:52.729
And he told her that
she couldn't get into Wharton
with a name like "Imani."

12:52.773 --> 12:54.189
And she believed him.

12:54.265 --> 12:56.524
Rejected me and believed him.

12:56.601 --> 12:59.319
Your spirit is still in there.

12:59.395 --> 13:03.031
Everything that you
instilled in her, I see it.

13:05.243 --> 13:06.951
I gotta be honest with you,

13:08.038 --> 13:13.833
as much as I love you,
and as much as I owe you,

13:15.128 --> 13:18.463
if this were just
about the land,

13:19.424 --> 13:21.216
baby, I wouldn't come.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.933
then that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

13:31.269 --> 13:37.023
-And I am gonna be
right there with 'ya.
-Mmm.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.559
You don't have to do it alone.

13:43.782 --> 13:48.660
[Sam] <i> Look everybody grease</i>
<i> the skids, that's just the w</i>
<i> it's been done here for year</i>

13:48.662 --> 13:50.203
<i> -It's just business.</i>
-[recorder clicked off]

13:52.249 --> 13:54.374
Uh... [clearing throat]

13:54.376 --> 13:59.295
We'll now have a statement
from a local farmer
on the matter on the tape.

13:59.297 --> 14:03.216
Your statement will go
into the official records
of our regional branch,

14:03.927 --> 14:05.993
all who are present,

14:05.995 --> 14:11.391
as well as the state senator
representing Louisiana's
agriculture committee.

14:13.728 --> 14:17.146
G'afternoon. [clearing throat]

14:17.148 --> 14:21.109
My name's
Ralph Angel Bordelon,
outta St. Josephine Parish.

14:21.903 --> 14:27.198
That tape you heard
is not an isolated incident.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.284
-Happens all the time.
-[man in room] Right!

14:29.286 --> 14:36.332
The Boudreaux and Landry
family are now 18 months
past doin' their loans.

14:36.376 --> 14:40.169
18, and they still
occupy that property.

14:40.171 --> 14:44.132
Now, my neighbor,
Miss Parthena Gilmore,
a black woman,

14:45.218 --> 14:48.052
she fell behind 90 days.

14:48.054 --> 14:53.892
90 days and got evicted
off some land her family
had for generations.

14:53.894 --> 15:00.023
Now the local U.S.D.A.,
it's no secret that
there's individuals

15:00.984 --> 15:03.142
that discriminate
against black farmers

15:03.219 --> 15:06.112
and has been discriminatin'
against black farmers, ever
since we had land to farm.

15:06.114 --> 15:09.324
Uh, Mr. Bordelon,
uh, are you aware

15:09.326 --> 15:17.040
that the government paid out
an additional 1.2 billion
settlement funds in 2013?

15:17.042 --> 15:22.128
Uh, that woulda been
around the time that you were,
uh, incarcerated.

15:22.839 --> 15:23.796
Correct?

15:26.217 --> 15:27.333
That's correct.

15:28.345 --> 15:31.137
I was incarcerated
when I was younger.

15:31.214 --> 15:35.141
Made some mistakes,
I did some time,
and I paid for 'em.

15:35.685 --> 15:39.812
I came home ready
to work like my daddy,

15:39.814 --> 15:44.943
who worked to support
our family, tryin' to climb up
some ladder that don't exist.

15:46.112 --> 15:49.864
When men,
like Sam Landry, get
to play by their own rules,

15:49.866 --> 15:51.783
what ladder?

15:51.859 --> 15:57.538
My daughter girl, Tru,
she ten months old,
my boy, he's 11.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.626
I'm not here today
on my behalf,
I'm here for them.

16:02.379 --> 16:05.380
In hopes,
that things'll be different,

16:05.382 --> 16:08.800
not only for them,
but hopefully
for their kids, too.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.094
I mean, it has to stop.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.554
I won't give up.

16:13.631 --> 16:15.139
-We need--
-Ahem, all right,
thank you,

16:15.216 --> 16:17.809
uh, your remarks
will be duly noted.

16:17.885 --> 16:19.852
-Uh, next order of business--
-Now, just a minute,

16:20.438 --> 16:22.605
I want to review these files.

16:22.607 --> 16:25.525
We'll put some time
on the schedule to discuss
at next week's meeting.

16:27.237 --> 16:31.197
I'll need all
of Mr. Miller's case records
for the last decade.

16:31.199 --> 16:34.701
My office and I will be going
through these personally,

16:34.703 --> 16:38.329
and we'll be sharing
our findings with the state
agricultural committee.

16:38.406 --> 16:41.874
I'll also need
Sam Landry's U.S.D.A.
loan history, as well.

16:41.876 --> 16:46.045
-And what was the other name
you mentioned, sir?
-Boudreaux.

16:46.047 --> 16:52.093
Thank you, Mr. Bordelon
for coming here and sharing
your experience with us today.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.220
Thank you
for your time today.
I thank you.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.223

Your mom's a badass.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.747
I sat on a panel
with her once at Harvard,

17:20.823 --> 17:23.291
Women Changing
the Cultural Landscape.

17:23.293 --> 17:24.959
She had the audience
on their feet at the end.

17:27.172 --> 17:31.299
-I'm Rae.
-Micah, it's nice
to meet you.

17:33.178 --> 17:37.138
Um, you know, when my grandma
said she was setting me up
with a fund manager named Rae,

17:37.215 --> 17:39.766
-I was kind of expecting--
-A white tech bro?

17:39.768 --> 17:43.102
-[chuckling] A white
tech bro, yeah.
-Listen, I get it.

17:43.179 --> 17:46.105
It's what we're used to,
but it doesn't have to be
what it is.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.640
Amen.

17:47.642 --> 17:49.817
That's exactly why I put
together my own fund.

17:49.819 --> 17:52.111
You know, my pitch
to investors was simple.

17:52.188 --> 17:54.405
Finding propulsive ideas that
are gonna shake up the world,

17:54.482 --> 17:57.742
should be spearheaded by those
who inherit the world.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.745
young people, who know
what will appeal to us, right?

18:00.822 --> 18:03.623
-Absolutely.
-[waiter] Can I take
your order?

18:03.625 --> 18:05.666
[Rae] Can you bring
us each one
a the small bites?

18:05.668 --> 18:06.751
-Thank you.
-[Micah] Thanks.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.254
-So...
-So...

18:10.256 --> 18:12.965
I wanna know what makes
an up and coming photographer

18:12.967 --> 18:15.093
leave an established place
and go out on your own?

18:16.012 --> 18:18.971
You're either crazy or brave.

18:19.048 --> 18:22.433
I don't know, I guess
I didn't know who I was
until I picked up a camera,

18:22.435 --> 18:25.728
and ever since then,
I felt this pull.

18:25.730 --> 18:30.900
I wanna create something
for us in Web3, decidedly
and definitively black.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.852
World changing.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.949
-You sound like an idealist.
The best kind of people.
-[Micah chuckling]

18:37.951 --> 18:41.994
But I didn't just build
this fund on dreams,
I built it on data.

18:42.071 --> 18:45.039
On the hard fact
that authenticity can be
profitable, I believe that.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.274
I agree.

18:48.378 --> 18:51.045
I'm gonna really need to delve
into your creative portfolio
and your business plan.

18:51.122 --> 18:53.280
I'm ready for that.

18:54.884 --> 18:59.220
-But are you ready for this?
'Cause this looks incredible.
-[Micah] Oh, wow. Ooh.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.722
-We gotta eat while
we change the world, right?
-Yeah, right.

19:21.035 --> 19:22.201
Aunt Martha?

19:25.415 --> 19:28.416
-Who's there?
-[exhaling] Hi!

19:29.169 --> 19:30.710
I'm looking
for my Aunt Martha.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.421
Nova, right?

19:35.258 --> 19:38.593
I'm Pearl, next house over.

19:38.595 --> 19:41.262
Hi, Miss Pearl.
Is... Is she around?

19:44.851 --> 19:46.642
Uh, I'm sorry, dear.

19:49.189 --> 19:52.440
Aunt Martha crossed
over last month.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.039
Huh.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.292
The past few weeks been hard.

20:15.298 --> 20:17.256
[Pearl whimpering]
She led all our prayers.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.514
You look just like them.

20:25.516 --> 20:29.977
Oh, those Lavoisier women
had a air about them.

20:29.979 --> 20:33.731
Regal, you could see
it in their eyes.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.737
-You knew my mother?
[exhaling]
-Oh, yes.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.697
She had a gift.

20:44.577 --> 20:49.914
I haven't kept up this part
of me. I feel like
it's all lost now.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.464
She left that out for you.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.218
I'm gonna give you some time.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.720
I'll be right across the way
if you need anything.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.056
Thank you.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.026

21:42.885 --> 21:44.860
[exhaling]

22:09.120 --> 22:12.455
-[Micah] I appreciate
you letting me tag along.
-Oh, it was my pleasure.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.666
We can't have you roamin'
these mean streets unattended.

22:15.668 --> 22:19.962
This isn't the hottest club
or whatever you did
with Ivory, but it's a vibe.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.047
For sure.

22:41.361 --> 22:42.985
Hey.

22:42.987 --> 22:44.945
-Micah, this is Blaze,
they're...
-Hey.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.530
...an incredible
performance artist,

22:46.532 --> 22:49.742
print makers, supported
by the Ford Foundation.

22:49.744 --> 22:53.120
Favorite
of Darren Walker, himself.

22:53.122 --> 22:57.333
-I mean, the Ford Foundation,
that's... Congratulations.
-Appreciate it.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.126
Micah West, right?

22:59.128 --> 23:02.129
-Amazing new artist
outta New Orleans.
-I'm familiar.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.298
-Interesting work.
-Thank you.

23:05.510 --> 23:08.594
For the record, that NFT
that I posted of my parents

23:08.671 --> 23:10.721
is a completely
different direction.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.849
Yeah, that one
was not the move.

23:13.851 --> 23:17.895
But then I saw your new stuff,
those photos
from the hurricane clean up.

23:17.897 --> 23:22.858
Out of all that
destruction and pain,
you capture connection.

23:22.860 --> 23:26.821
That's what it's
all about, connection.
We need more a that.

23:26.823 --> 23:29.323
-I agree.
-Ooh, let's
see what's cookin'.

23:31.119 --> 23:34.787
Liza works
for Shenarri Freeman
at Cadence. You know it?

23:34.789 --> 23:38.749
-Um, no. No, should I?
-Damn, I shoulda
taken you there.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.960
The best vegan soul food
you've ever had.

23:40.962 --> 23:42.086
-[Micah] Okay.
-They made
the New York Times

23:42.163 --> 23:43.671
for the most
exciting restaurants.

23:43.673 --> 23:46.424
-Those sisters can burn.
-Mmm...

23:46.426 --> 23:47.758
-[Rae] Ready
to meet more people?
-Yeah.

23:47.969 --> 23:49.743
Come on.

23:49.745 --> 23:53.764
-Good people, this is Micah
West, straight outta the NO.
-NO!

23:53.766 --> 23:55.248
What's up?

23:55.250 --> 23:58.060
I never imagined this much
drama to get this deal done.

23:58.062 --> 23:59.812
[Sam] It's always somethin'
with those people.

23:59.889 --> 24:02.064
They always had to push.

24:02.066 --> 24:04.650
Well, maybe we played
the wrong hand with them.

24:04.652 --> 24:07.695
-Maybe we shoulda tried
finesse tactics.
-No.

24:08.573 --> 24:13.200
For people like them,
only dominance works.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.204
Well, it hasn't been working.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.124
Are you doubting me?

24:21.002 --> 24:22.918
Quite frankly, yes.

24:25.465 --> 24:30.050
I had no intention
of being here this long.

24:30.052 --> 24:34.597
-What we're
doing isn't working.
-It all ends today.

24:34.599 --> 24:37.850
The council will vote
in our favor,
and the bank issues,

24:37.852 --> 24:43.397
the permit issues,
the historical society issues,
all disappear.

24:43.474 --> 24:49.236
And you, a black descendent,
have domain over that property
as much as them.

24:50.448 --> 24:52.740
It's a full circle
moment for me.

24:54.452 --> 24:57.578
It's... It's fate.

24:57.580 --> 25:02.124
It's... Perfect.

25:05.963 --> 25:10.424
Thank you all for coming.
Usually our board
meetings are closed.

25:10.426 --> 25:17.097
But with a project like this
with the starts and stops,
we wanted full visibility.

25:17.099 --> 25:19.975
-So you know
it's real this time.
-[board chuckling]

25:19.977 --> 25:22.937
If there isn't
any further discussion
from the board,

25:23.856 --> 25:25.689
let's make this vote official!

25:25.691 --> 25:28.192
All in favor of finalizing

25:28.227 --> 25:30.444
the sale of land
for the commercial
development--

25:30.446 --> 25:36.033
Uh, before a vote, uh,
at this time, outside remarks
must be heard.

25:36.035 --> 25:39.411
Now, that's, uh, according
to the Hamilton bylaws.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.289
I'm a long time farmer
in this community,

25:42.366 --> 25:45.543
and a proud member
of the farmin' coop.

25:46.254 --> 25:50.047
Okay then,
community comments time.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.799
-[board chuckling]
-Give it your best shot, sir.

26:00.977 --> 26:03.727
How are you gonna sell
land this isn't yours, Sam?

26:07.817 --> 26:08.816
Mama?

26:10.111 --> 26:11.527
Surprised to see me, baby?

26:12.572 --> 26:15.948
Uh, yes. Yes, ma'am.

26:16.284 --> 26:17.741
What are you doing here?

26:17.818 --> 26:19.910
Something that I should have
done long time ago.

26:20.621 --> 26:21.829
I've come to get you.

26:22.957 --> 26:25.958
Uh... Get me?

26:25.960 --> 26:29.461
I've let your father turn
you into someone that
I don't even recognize,

26:29.538 --> 26:31.647
and for what?

26:31.649 --> 26:36.635
Baby, none of his... His money
and power is worth a damn
when you're miserable.

26:36.637 --> 26:39.054
I'm miserable,
and I think you are, too.

26:47.189 --> 26:50.107
Mother, please,
it's a done deal.

26:50.142 --> 26:52.985
I can't let you do this.

26:52.987 --> 26:54.945
It's the one that keeps
your checks coming
every month.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.363
Don't bite the hand, Mom.

26:59.368 --> 27:01.535
W... Watch
your mouth, partner.

27:08.961 --> 27:15.758
Part of the land that
Sam Landry is leveraging
for this deal is mine.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.223
It's ours.

27:23.517 --> 27:26.977
Mine and my daughter's.

27:46.999 --> 27:50.793
-This marriage certificate
doesn't mean anything unless--
-He never filed for divorce,

27:50.795 --> 27:52.127
and I didn't either.

27:52.963 --> 27:56.048
This, this paper right here,

27:57.426 --> 28:01.512
it's signed by Sam
and his father,
your grandfather.

28:01.588 --> 28:05.349
Violet and Ernest helped
me figure out what to ask for.

28:05.351 --> 28:10.396
A lump sum,
plus quarterly payments
according to interest rates.

28:10.398 --> 28:11.814
That was Ernest's idea.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.566
Plus, full custody of you.

28:14.568 --> 28:15.901
-[Betty] And--
-Land.

28:15.978 --> 28:17.903
I think that's why
he never divorced me.

28:17.905 --> 28:20.406
He figured as long as we were
legally wed, it was his.

28:20.408 --> 28:23.617
But, I guess he counted
on me never coming back.

28:24.912 --> 28:26.286
Why are you back?

28:26.288 --> 28:27.746
You don't care
about this place.

28:27.823 --> 28:29.081
I came back for you.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.874
Mother, I live in Atlanta,

28:30.876 --> 28:32.751
and could give a damn
about this place myself.

28:32.828 --> 28:34.169
I just want my money.

28:34.171 --> 28:35.295
That's what I care about.

28:35.297 --> 28:36.964
Well, I care about you.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.465
Selling out the Bordelons,

28:38.467 --> 28:40.008
and bulldozing over
land that our family

28:40.052 --> 28:41.385
has worked on for decades?

28:41.387 --> 28:43.929
Letting your father take
what he promised to me?

28:44.006 --> 28:45.556
All that cannot abide.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.224
You cannot let this happen.

28:47.935 --> 28:49.184
You are better than this.

28:49.186 --> 28:50.936
You come from
better than this.

28:51.439 --> 28:52.938
My side, good people.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.357
You are good.

28:56.444 --> 28:57.818
Walk away from this, Imari.

28:59.029 --> 29:00.553
It's Parker.

29:12.293 --> 29:15.085
[Nova] I feel like
I let Martha and my
mother down.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.569
I should have went
to see her more often,

29:16.647 --> 29:19.757
I should have been more
in tune with her all along,

29:19.759 --> 29:22.718
with everything on my
mother's side of the family.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.095
I lost my way.
I got distracted.

29:25.172 --> 29:26.430
My book, Dominic.

29:27.016 --> 29:28.348
It's not me.

29:28.726 --> 29:30.100
I failed her.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.935
I failed all of them.

29:31.937 --> 29:35.731
Do you still feel
things for people?

29:35.733 --> 29:39.359
When you were little,
you'd get a feeling from
somebody, and just,

29:39.361 --> 29:41.945
I don't know, you'd kinda
go off in a trance somehow.

29:43.032 --> 29:44.281
Sometimes.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.325
My mom had it too,
but I haven't cultivated it.

29:46.401 --> 29:48.660
Practiced it.
I just let it go.

29:48.662 --> 29:52.331
I mean, I can barely remember
blessings and incantations.

29:52.333 --> 29:54.124
Chants, herbs...

29:55.044 --> 29:56.627
...I don't know
how I got here.

29:56.703 --> 29:58.370
[Billie] You still
believe they're here?

29:58.372 --> 30:00.672
That those that have
gone before us are still
among us now?

30:00.674 --> 30:02.841
Yes, you know I do.

30:02.918 --> 30:04.426
Then it's not too late.

30:05.346 --> 30:07.179
Shut 'em down, Nova.

30:07.181 --> 30:09.097
Do the work and get it back.

30:13.771 --> 30:14.812
What is she doing here?

30:15.648 --> 30:16.772
Who?

30:21.779 --> 30:23.987
That was me last year.

30:24.064 --> 30:26.698
Trying to find a place
to drown my memories.

30:29.954 --> 30:31.119
Think we should ask her over?

30:31.163 --> 30:32.329
Hell no!

30:32.998 --> 30:34.147
What are you even saying?

30:34.224 --> 30:37.459
Right now, she seems
like the enemy.

30:37.461 --> 30:39.711
But I'm gonna talk to her
like a human being.

30:39.713 --> 30:41.129
It might make a difference.

30:48.639 --> 30:50.764
Make it a whiskey,
and one for her, too.

30:50.766 --> 30:51.765
[bartender] Yes, ma'am.
Coming right up.

30:51.842 --> 30:53.684
[chuckles]

30:55.479 --> 30:57.337
I'd ask for a martini,

30:57.339 --> 30:59.606
but I don't think they
know how to make that
in this Podunk town.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.525
-[bartender] Here
you go, ladies.
-You'd be surprised.

31:02.945 --> 31:05.362
So you look like you could
use some company.

31:07.074 --> 31:08.365
You wanna join us?

31:10.995 --> 31:12.035
No, thanks.

31:17.543 --> 31:18.667
Hey.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.169
You ever call that man?

31:21.171 --> 31:22.504
I did.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.172
And we're getting married.

31:24.174 --> 31:25.716
[gasps]

31:25.718 --> 31:27.467
Because of my advice?

31:27.544 --> 31:28.802
[both chuckle]

31:28.804 --> 31:30.679
Maybe a little.

31:30.681 --> 31:32.097
But you know, none of that
would have happened

31:32.174 --> 31:33.432
if I hadn't come home.

31:34.310 --> 31:35.392
Faced my past.

31:37.479 --> 31:39.730
And we both know a little bit

31:39.806 --> 31:42.399
about coming home
and blowing things up.

31:44.028 --> 31:45.694
Where you been living again?

31:46.822 --> 31:47.779
Chicago.

31:48.699 --> 31:49.948
You're lucky you got out.

31:50.659 --> 31:51.950
I was run out.

31:53.454 --> 31:54.828
Just like you and your mother.

31:57.124 --> 31:58.832
You ever ask her why she left?

32:03.923 --> 32:05.422
I tried, but...

32:06.467 --> 32:07.999
...but she shuts down.

32:09.219 --> 32:13.305
And yet, she still came back
to face your father anyhow.

32:19.897 --> 32:21.063
[door opening]

32:24.818 --> 32:26.401
Vi's cooking dinner later.

32:27.696 --> 32:29.196
Wants us to come by
and meet Betty.

32:30.699 --> 32:31.782
[Ralph Angel exhales]

32:36.038 --> 32:37.204
I'm scared.

32:37.206 --> 32:38.455
Of what?

32:40.042 --> 32:41.792
I thought that all this
was behind us.

32:42.836 --> 32:43.961
But I guess it was...

32:44.964 --> 32:46.279
...only behind me.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.174
I'm scared to bring
all this back up again.

32:49.176 --> 32:50.717
I don't get the point.

32:53.347 --> 32:54.721
But if it's hurting you,

32:56.600 --> 32:57.849
I'll do it.

32:57.851 --> 32:59.309
[Ralph Angel] I'm not
trying to hurt you.

33:00.354 --> 33:02.396
But if I don't talk about it,
nothing changes.

33:02.982 --> 33:04.523
What do you wanna change?

33:06.527 --> 33:07.943
I think we should tell him.

33:10.030 --> 33:12.280
Tell him what?

33:12.324 --> 33:14.449
He already knows you're not
his biological father.

33:14.451 --> 33:16.218
What else do you
wanna tell him?

33:16.220 --> 33:18.870
I don't want him being
surprised if he finds out
about Chase.

33:18.872 --> 33:20.998
I mean, they living
in the same city.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.541
What if he end up at school
with the man kids--

33:22.543 --> 33:25.127
I do not want our son

33:25.671 --> 33:27.504
to associate that night

33:29.008 --> 33:30.716
with what happened to me.

33:31.969 --> 33:33.427
With who he is.

33:34.471 --> 33:37.389
That's not his identity,
Ralph Angel, he's,

33:37.391 --> 33:40.142
he's so much more
than where he came from.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.727
Ain't it better
coming from us?

33:41.729 --> 33:43.353
Ralph Angel, he's only 11.

33:43.897 --> 33:46.064
He is too young.

33:46.066 --> 33:48.775
Blue is smart as hell.
Now he's too young?

33:49.695 --> 33:51.086
I don't want him catching up.

33:51.088 --> 33:52.821
I always want him to know
where he stands with us.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.531
You are doing
too much, Ralph Angel,
you are doing too much.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.659
It's his, this is
so unnecessary!

33:57.661 --> 33:59.494
-Where is this coming from?
-It's coming from my gut!

34:02.249 --> 34:04.708
Look, I remember when Charlie
would come for summers.

34:05.919 --> 34:07.961
And I knew we have
the same mom.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.504
But Pops never
talked about it.

34:11.050 --> 34:12.299
But it hurt.

34:12.676 --> 34:13.842
All of us.

34:14.470 --> 34:16.178
Look, I know how that feels.

34:16.180 --> 34:17.596
And I don't want
Blue going through that.

34:17.598 --> 34:20.057
Blue isn't you, Ralph Angel.

34:21.310 --> 34:23.351
He is too young.

34:23.353 --> 34:24.936
And it is too soon.

34:29.359 --> 34:30.650
No.

34:31.945 --> 34:33.403
[exhales]

34:38.077 --> 34:40.243
[Betty] You know,
she's never gonna forgive me.

34:40.245 --> 34:43.205
[exhales] I just feel
like I lost my daughter.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.499
Yeah, well.

34:45.876 --> 34:47.501
I'm not a mother.

34:49.088 --> 34:52.089
But I know a little bit
about raising a baby,

34:52.091 --> 34:54.091
and letting them go.

34:55.177 --> 34:58.011
And I'm sure that
you made the choice

34:58.013 --> 35:00.722
that you thought
was best at the time.

35:02.726 --> 35:05.435
And I'm also sure

35:05.437 --> 35:10.816
that that girl has more of you
in her than she even knows.

35:13.821 --> 35:14.945
[Violet] Sam.

35:18.325 --> 35:19.324
Mm-mm.

35:20.410 --> 35:21.701
You're not welcome here.

35:22.496 --> 35:23.453
I'm okay about it.

35:25.749 --> 35:26.873
I'm okay.

35:41.306 --> 35:42.889
I brought you the paperwork.

35:43.684 --> 35:45.392
Giving you the land outright.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.940
I can't afford
for this to go public,

35:51.984 --> 35:53.608
after all these years.

36:00.409 --> 36:03.118
-You still take
my breath away--
-Don't.

36:10.460 --> 36:13.336
You ever wonder
what our lives would
have been like,

36:13.338 --> 36:14.296
together?

36:14.298 --> 36:16.339
Yeah. I do.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.428
Everything would
have been different.

36:22.097 --> 36:24.723
Not just our lives.
Our daughter.

36:25.601 --> 36:28.518
This whole town
could have been different,

36:28.520 --> 36:31.104
and you could have
made that happen.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.231
Fight hatred.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.525
Set an example.

36:37.029 --> 36:38.320
But you were weak.

36:39.072 --> 36:40.822
You were a coward.

36:42.326 --> 36:43.825
So you took the easy way out.

36:44.745 --> 36:46.786
I wish I had
been stronger then.

36:51.627 --> 36:52.876
And now.

37:14.650 --> 37:17.150
-Hey, Vi?
-[Violet] Hey, baby!

37:17.152 --> 37:19.694
-[Ralph Angel]
What's going on?
-Where's Darla? And Tru?

37:19.696 --> 37:22.781
Tru was fussing, so Darla
stayed home with her.

37:22.857 --> 37:25.408
-Good to see you too.
-Mm. [chuckles]

37:25.410 --> 37:28.745
Betty, this is my nephew,
Ralph Angel.

37:28.747 --> 37:32.332
He's the reason that I flew
to Seattle to see you.

37:32.409 --> 37:34.793
-[Ralph Angel] How you doing?
-Oh, look at you!

37:36.004 --> 37:37.837
Oh, I knew your daddy from,

37:37.839 --> 37:39.664
from almost the day
I was born.

37:39.666 --> 37:43.426
And I heard about
everything you're doing
in St. Jo with the co-op.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.304
Your daddy would be so proud.

37:46.306 --> 37:49.140
I don't know if we could
have held on without
you stepping in.

37:49.142 --> 37:51.643
Yeah, the Arsenaults
and Bordelons

37:51.645 --> 37:54.729
been shoulder to shoulder
a long time.

37:54.731 --> 37:56.731
And it's not gonna stop now.

37:57.359 --> 37:58.424
[chuckling]

37:58.502 --> 38:00.694
[Betty] My daddy
was hard on me,

38:00.696 --> 38:03.321
but I knew deep down,
he loved me.

38:03.907 --> 38:07.409
And, he would
want me to do this.

38:07.411 --> 38:10.453
This is the property deed
to the land Sam stole.

38:10.530 --> 38:13.039
My land, in my name,
like it should have been
all along.

38:15.544 --> 38:18.211
That land's just been sitting
there, all these years.

38:19.589 --> 38:21.298
So I know you're gonna
put it to good use.

38:31.143 --> 38:32.517
This is for the co-op?

38:32.769 --> 38:34.311
For the Bordelons.

38:34.387 --> 38:36.730
I mean, build a new
house on it, farm it,

38:36.732 --> 38:38.773
sell it and get
your land back, whatever.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.692
Just make good use of it.

38:42.029 --> 38:44.112
Make it mean something.

38:48.910 --> 38:52.537
Feels like one thing
after another since
we lost our land.

38:52.614 --> 38:54.497
Not knowing if
I'm doing the right thing.

38:55.375 --> 38:56.541
Going the right way.

38:58.253 --> 38:59.711
And you bless me with this.

39:03.216 --> 39:05.008
-Lets me know
he's still watching.
-[Betty] Mm.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.593
Telling me to keep going.

39:07.971 --> 39:09.596
Thank you ain't
enough, Miss Betty.

39:11.767 --> 39:13.683
You just keep going, baby.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.393
Keep going.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.021
[Ralph Angel] Thank you.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.230
[Betty] You're welcome.

39:19.307 --> 39:20.440
[all laughing]

39:20.517 --> 39:22.192
I'm telling you,
now these two,

39:22.268 --> 39:24.569
they used to follow
me and Ernest around
like puppies.

39:24.571 --> 39:26.604
[all laughing]

39:26.606 --> 39:29.866
Asking him all these questions
about the kind of music
he was listening to,

39:29.868 --> 39:31.826
what's his favorite
movie that he watched--

39:31.828 --> 39:33.328
Well, of course we did!
What did you expect?

39:33.372 --> 39:34.704
We were 10, and you were,

39:34.706 --> 39:38.166
-you guys were, what,
uh, 17 and 18?
-Wow.

39:38.210 --> 39:40.585
-Shoot, you was
the coolest people we knew!
-We didn't know no better!

39:40.662 --> 39:42.212
-[laughing]
-Well, I'd have
gave anything to see

39:42.214 --> 39:44.339
a 17-year-old Mr. Prosper!

39:44.341 --> 39:46.800
But I bet you was cooler
than a polar bear's toenails.

39:46.802 --> 39:47.926
Still hella cool!

39:47.928 --> 39:49.594
-Yeah! I'm nice!
-Hey!

39:49.671 --> 39:52.180
I had the biggest
crush on Ernest.

39:52.182 --> 39:54.224
Ah, but Vi, you knew that.

39:54.300 --> 39:56.059
Every girl in town did.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.852
By the time I was old enough,

39:57.854 --> 40:00.021
you know, he was
already with Trudy,

40:00.023 --> 40:02.232
and then Sam
started coming around.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.694
You ever wonder
what could have been?

40:07.114 --> 40:08.905
Don't do no good, baby.

40:08.982 --> 40:10.865
'Cause boy,
I coulda been your mama.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.952
[all laugh]

40:14.538 --> 40:15.995
[knocking on door]

40:32.013 --> 40:33.138
Uh...

40:36.393 --> 40:37.934
...I came to apologize.

40:39.521 --> 40:41.521
I didn't know the whole story.

40:42.858 --> 40:44.816
I didn't know
he abandoned you.

40:46.778 --> 40:47.819
Us.

40:50.323 --> 40:51.698
Why didn't you tell me?

40:52.576 --> 40:54.784
Because I didn't want you

40:54.786 --> 40:56.953
to walk through this world
with the bitterness

40:57.497 --> 40:59.330
that I held on for so long.

41:09.426 --> 41:10.633
[Violet] Parker.

41:11.678 --> 41:12.802
Baby, come on. Sit down.

41:12.879 --> 41:14.721
We got all this food here,

41:14.723 --> 41:16.931
it's just us,
come be yourself.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.057
Please, baby.

41:19.102 --> 41:20.435
Stay.

41:41.208 --> 41:43.416
This man was just
in the middle of a lie.

41:43.418 --> 41:45.919
[stammering] Here,
here we go! Here we go!

41:45.921 --> 41:47.712
-[Prosper] Here we go!
-[Violet] Finish! Finish!

41:47.714 --> 41:49.839
-[Prosper] Finish?
-[laughing]

41:49.841 --> 41:51.382
[Prosper] You're
telling me to?

41:51.384 --> 41:53.801
[all laughing]
