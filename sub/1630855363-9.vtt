-Good morning.

You want me to
make you some coffee?

-Uh...

01:49.963 --> 01:52.168
Ah, it's alright.
I'll just grab something
on the way.

01:52.201 --> 01:54.540
Thanks. Um, still
coming tonight, right?

01:54.573 --> 01:56.811
Most definitely.

how you do what you do.

02:14.278 --> 02:17.251
Well, thanks, Dad.
It means a lot.

02:17.284 --> 02:20.692
I know you can put
a lot of pressure on yourself.

I had a left Twix,

pressure's our friend here.

But that's okay is the point.

02:30.912 --> 02:32.882
Because I love you very much.

02:33.450 --> 02:35.220

Baby, if that's true,

02:55.895 --> 02:58.901
then why put so much
pressure on this one?

03:03.309 --> 03:05.515
Because I...

if I could do another one.

I'm not trying to...

08:33.770 --> 08:35.741

like you need mine.

08:55.013 --> 08:55.982
Yes, Nat, I have a phone.

Okay.

09:01.726 --> 09:03.196
Good, good.
Menu looks good.

09:03.229 --> 09:04.766
Looks like a menu. And...

09:05.200 --> 09:07.738
-Just gotta do it, like,
a thousand times now.
-Hmm.

with your mom like?

09:17.290 --> 09:19.195
Okay. Where did that come from?

09:19.228 --> 09:23.136
Um, uh, Nat, Nat invited
our mom to, uh,

09:23.169 --> 09:24.706
to dinner, so...

09:24.739 --> 09:26.309
It's not-not-not good?

09:26.342 --> 09:28.881
It's not good.
I mean, it's, um, it's fine.

09:28.914 --> 09:30.150
It's fine for me 'cause I know

09:30.183 --> 09:32.354
that it's like
a fuckin' disaster.

09:32.387 --> 09:35.060
I know what to expect,
but for Nat, it's...

09:35.093 --> 09:36.362
It's really not good.

09:36.395 --> 09:38.634
She-she expects, like,
some kinda fuckin' miracle

09:38.667 --> 09:39.669
or something.

09:39.702 --> 09:42.107
Well, to answer your question,

09:42.140 --> 09:45.313
I-I don't really have
a great relationship with my...

09:45.346 --> 09:48.687
Um... She's dead. She died.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.992
I could have probably
said that a bit smoother.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.062
Yeah, she died
when I was, like, four. Lupus.

09:57.003 --> 09:58.674
I feel... I'm sorry.
I feel like I should have
known that or something.

09:58.707 --> 09:59.976
No. Don't, don't, don't, don't.

10:00.009 --> 10:01.212
Don't do the... that thing.

10:01.245 --> 10:02.247
-The, like...
-What?

10:02.280 --> 10:04.251
"I'm sorry for your loss" thing.

10:04.284 --> 10:06.022
It's okay,
it happened a while ago,

10:06.055 --> 10:07.725
and, you know, I don't know.

10:07.758 --> 10:09.061
-Alright, well--
-I was young.

10:09.094 --> 10:10.229
-Whatever.
-I'm sorry.

10:11.432 --> 10:13.203
-Thank you.
-Yeah. (clears throat)

10:13.236 --> 10:15.106
Yeah, so we don't really
have the best relationship

10:15.139 --> 10:18.112
just 'cause of the whole,
like, dead thing.

10:18.145 --> 10:19.381
That'll do it.

10:19.414 --> 10:21.886
-That'll really do it. Yeah.
-CARMY: Yeah.

10:35.948 --> 10:37.985
-(Richie chuckles)
-What's up?

10:38.486 --> 10:39.890
Why don't you go lay down?

10:39.923 --> 10:41.259
Hmm, if I lay down,

10:41.292 --> 10:42.996
I will never stand up again.

10:43.029 --> 10:45.133
Show me the month.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.703
Okay, um...

10:46.736 --> 10:47.872
Here, sit down.

10:49.174 --> 10:50.276
Thank you.

10:53.416 --> 10:55.721
-Huh.
-Huh?

10:55.754 --> 10:57.492
-Uh-huh.
-Uh-huh what?

10:57.525 --> 11:00.430
We're good for
a couple weeks and then...

11:00.463 --> 11:01.967
It's not bad.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.238
-No, it's-it's not bad.
-It's not.

11:04.271 --> 11:05.775
But it's barely good.

11:05.808 --> 11:06.910
And we need great.

11:07.411 --> 11:08.948
Well, food costs,
labor aren't cheap.

11:08.981 --> 11:10.250
All these cooks aren't cheap.

11:10.283 --> 11:11.385
You know what else isn't cheap?

11:11.418 --> 11:12.822
Cantaloupe and caviar.

11:12.855 --> 11:13.890
Correct.

11:14.458 --> 11:16.863
-Dope, though.
-It's definitely dope.

11:16.896 --> 11:18.733
So dope the menu
has to go up five.

11:20.269 --> 11:23.276
Yeah.
Five, seven. Agreed.

11:23.309 --> 11:25.313
-Yeah, you're thinking that?
-RICHIE: I think so.

11:25.346 --> 11:28.052
I'm not actually entirely sure
what we're talking about.

11:28.085 --> 11:30.891
Yeah, we gotta raise the prices
by five percent.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.296
Uh... word.

11:33.329 --> 11:35.333
(sighs) I won't panic yet.

11:35.366 --> 11:36.469
I'm not gonna panic.

11:36.503 --> 11:39.275
-Yeah, likewise, Chef.
-Yeah.

11:39.308 --> 11:40.811
How full are we next week?

11:40.844 --> 11:42.180
Next week? We're full.

11:42.213 --> 11:43.249
SUGAR: Yeah? And then?

11:43.282 --> 11:45.153
And then, you know,
not as full.

11:45.186 --> 11:46.990
Okay, we die down, we die.

11:47.023 --> 11:49.294
-Mm-hmm.
-Is there a waitlist?

11:51.800 --> 11:53.235
How many holds every night?

11:55.340 --> 11:57.410
-None.
-Okay.

11:58.547 --> 11:59.983
I'm panicking.

12:00.016 --> 12:01.251
No. Come on.

12:02.287 --> 12:04.324
Fuck that. We got this.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.963
-Yeah?
-RICHIE: Mm-hmm

12:08.299 --> 12:09.502
We got this.

12:09.736 --> 12:12.975
("New Noise" by Refused playing)

12:15.881 --> 12:17.919
Alright, Chef,
I need you to salt that
like a sidewalk.

12:17.952 --> 12:19.121
Like my childhood home.

12:19.154 --> 12:20.190
The fuck did you
grow up, Arizona?

12:20.223 --> 12:21.560
-CONNOR: Chef.
-CARMY: Look. Okay?

12:21.593 --> 12:23.296
-Pans, please.
-CONNOR: Yes, Chef.

12:23.329 --> 12:25.467
CARMY:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why is this on the left side?

12:25.501 --> 12:28.206
It should be on the right side
'cause we're all right-handed.

12:28.239 --> 12:29.475
-CONNOR: Whoa! Shit!
-SYDNEY: Jesus Christ!

12:29.509 --> 12:30.811
-JOSH: Butterfinger boy!
-(yells)

12:30.844 --> 12:32.047
CARMY:
Okay, that's my fault.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.416
Who the fuck put it
on the left side?

12:33.449 --> 12:35.020
The contractor,
who's left-handed,
who called you

12:35.053 --> 12:36.890
about fifty-eleven times
asking what side to put it on.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.794
-Carmen, do you
even have a phone?
-Yes, I have a phone, T.

12:38.827 --> 12:40.831
Why didn't you tell him
to put it on the right side?

12:40.864 --> 12:43.136
Because you're the one
who asked for final approvals

12:43.169 --> 12:44.973
over all equipments, Chef.

12:45.006 --> 12:46.810
-That was you.
-TINA: Focus. Please.

12:46.843 --> 12:48.179
Bro, that's wild fast.

12:48.212 --> 12:49.549
TINA:
That's obscenely fast.

12:49.582 --> 12:50.985
MARCUS:
You all are like
making me nervous.

12:51.018 --> 12:52.555
Carmen, I'm ready
when you're ready.

12:52.588 --> 12:54.258
CARMY: Yeah,
I'll be right there, Chef.

12:54.291 --> 12:57.431
Alright.
Two hours to open, Chefs.

12:57.464 --> 12:59.134
-Menu run in 45.
-ALL: Chef.

12:59.167 --> 13:01.105
CARMY:
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Chef, Chef. Behind.

13:01.138 --> 13:02.575
-Did you taste this?
-DANIELA: Um, not yet.

13:02.608 --> 13:04.011
Needs way more acid.

13:04.044 --> 13:05.548
Reduce that for,
like, ten minutes maybe?

13:05.581 --> 13:07.050
The consistency
is not there.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.620
Yes, Chef.
Behind, behind, behind.

13:08.653 --> 13:11.425
CARMY:
We need the handles
at 45-degree angles.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.933
Okay? We can grab 'em faster.
Every second counts. Chefs!

13:14.966 --> 13:15.801
ALL: Yes, Chef.

13:15.835 --> 13:17.371
-SYDNEY: Behind, behind, behind.
-Chef.

13:17.404 --> 13:18.974
-Check.
-Looks gorgeous, Chef.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.343
-SYDNEY: Checked. Thank you.
-CARMY: Marcus, you ready?

13:20.376 --> 13:21.980
-Let's do it, Chef.
-CARMY: Behind.

13:22.013 --> 13:23.048
Corner.

13:23.550 --> 13:24.919
-Syd?
-SYDNEY: Yep. Coming.

13:24.952 --> 13:25.854
Behind you.

13:26.422 --> 13:28.960
Alright, so we got number one...

13:30.564 --> 13:31.833
Mom's Honeybun.

13:32.635 --> 13:35.140
-That's nice, Chef.
-Thank you, Chef.

13:35.173 --> 13:37.377
Number two.
You guys seen this one already.

13:37.410 --> 13:39.481
But... Copenhagen Sundae.

13:39.883 --> 13:42.320
-Well, this is like a classic.
-Right?

13:42.722 --> 13:45.961
Number three
is Sydney's Donut...

13:46.395 --> 13:48.032
in parentheses
After Carm Destroyed it

13:48.065 --> 13:49.067
Like a Little Bitch.

13:49.100 --> 13:50.269
I don't really know where
the name came from.

13:50.303 --> 13:52.542
Definitely not from some asshole
who's gonna feel like shit

13:52.575 --> 13:53.544
about it
for the rest of his life.

13:53.577 --> 13:54.378
MARCUS:
Yeah, definitely not.

13:54.411 --> 13:55.981
But I am glad
he feels like shit.

13:56.014 --> 13:57.985
-I-I vote we workshop the name.
-Good.

13:58.018 --> 13:59.254
-Yeah.
-Oh, we can talk about it.

13:59.287 --> 14:00.958
EBRA: Marcus,
package from Denmark.

14:00.991 --> 14:02.528
Thank you, Chef.

14:02.561 --> 14:04.264
And then number four,

14:04.297 --> 14:07.370
bonus edition,
special savory dish.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.909
-CARMY: Wow.
-MARCUS: Wait one second.

14:09.942 --> 14:10.944
(Carmy whistles)

14:11.378 --> 14:13.917
This one is a little bit
of all of us.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.155
Everything that we all

14:16.188 --> 14:18.025
kinda know
about each other and...

14:19.094 --> 14:21.899
And I wouldn't know any of you
if I didn't work at The Beef.

14:23.937 --> 14:25.005
What's this one called?

14:26.308 --> 14:27.511
The Michael.

14:36.529 --> 14:37.965
You can throw down, huh?

14:37.998 --> 14:39.702
TINA:
Jeff? Jimmy's out front.

14:39.735 --> 14:41.105
Yeah, T. Thank you.

14:41.138 --> 14:43.275
-TINA: Housekeeping.
-ALL: Chef!

14:47.618 --> 14:49.121
So what I gotta do?

14:49.154 --> 14:51.358
You'll be fine.
It's a eight-hour online test.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.262
Just, you know,
have him take it tonight.

14:53.295 --> 14:54.933
Health inspectors
aren't coming today.

14:54.966 --> 14:57.036
-You sure about that?
-Nope.

14:57.738 --> 14:59.240
And then there's this.

15:01.713 --> 15:03.282
I wanna know what this is?

15:03.315 --> 15:04.652
Yeah, you most certainly
wanna know what that is.

15:05.320 --> 15:08.560
That, my friend,
is a State of Illinois

15:08.593 --> 15:10.430
Business Certificate

15:10.463 --> 15:13.302
which certifies that The Bear
is allowed to do business

15:13.335 --> 15:16.976
in, and only in,
the great state of Illinois.

15:20.717 --> 15:22.320
Congratulations, partner.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.092
Thank you.

15:27.096 --> 15:28.165
It's, um...

15:29.301 --> 15:30.469
It feels heavy.

15:31.438 --> 15:33.209
Heavy moment, right?

15:33.242 --> 15:35.146
I mean,
odds are against you, kid.

15:35.179 --> 15:36.481
-Is that right?
-Yeah, that's right.

15:39.020 --> 15:42.661
May I share with you a story
of complete and utter failure?

15:44.565 --> 15:46.636
-Yes. I've been waiting.
-CICERO: Wonderful.

15:46.669 --> 15:50.176
Do you remember Alex Gonzalez?
Shortstop for the Cubs?

15:50.645 --> 15:53.282
Um... no.
No, I don't think so.

15:53.315 --> 15:54.619
Right. And it's a shame
you don't think so,

15:54.652 --> 15:56.488
but I'm gonna explain why
you don't think so.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.493
He was a good player.
Solid player.

15:58.526 --> 16:01.398
Moved around a lot.
Cubs had him, like, two years.

16:01.431 --> 16:03.369
One of those years,
they're playing the Marlins.

16:03.402 --> 16:04.606
-Huh.
-CICERO: Right?

16:04.639 --> 16:05.674
Cubbies up three-one.

16:05.707 --> 16:07.176
Top of the eighth. Game six.

16:07.443 --> 16:09.782
National League
Championship fuckin' Series.

16:09.815 --> 16:10.684
-CARMY: Hmm.
-Okay?

16:10.717 --> 16:12.722
They win, they go
to the World Series,

16:12.755 --> 16:14.759
which at this point
they hadn't been in, like,

16:14.792 --> 16:17.097
I don't know, 45 years, okay?

16:17.130 --> 16:18.700
Runner on first,
runner on second.

16:18.733 --> 16:20.470
There's one out.

16:20.504 --> 16:25.079
Miguel Cabrera hits a choppy,
shitty little thing to Gonzalez.

16:25.112 --> 16:27.384
Right?
And I mean an easy grab,

16:27.417 --> 16:28.553
no-fuckin'-brainer kinda thing.

16:28.586 --> 16:31.392
But for whatever reason,
Gonzalez is like,

16:31.425 --> 16:34.131
oh, maybe I'll catch it
with my hand and then,

16:34.164 --> 16:35.701
oh, maybe I'll catch it
with my glove

16:35.734 --> 16:37.470
and, oh, maybe
I'll catch it with both.

16:37.504 --> 16:40.276
He bobbled the fuckin' ball,
didn't make the double play,

16:40.309 --> 16:42.280
couldn't send
the Cubs to the ninth.

16:42.715 --> 16:45.319
Unforced error, right?

16:46.088 --> 16:48.159
The result of that,
the bases are loaded.

16:48.192 --> 16:50.531
And the result of that,
all fuckin' hell breaks loose.

16:50.564 --> 16:53.202
Error after error after error.

16:53.235 --> 16:56.342
Oh, man. The Cubs
fall apart at the seams.

16:56.375 --> 16:58.378
Marlins score five runs,
Cubs lose.

17:01.719 --> 17:03.289
So why don't we
remember him?

17:03.322 --> 17:06.495
Because that very same inning,
several plays earlier,

17:06.963 --> 17:10.403
Luis Castillo hits a foul ball
to left outfield.

17:10.436 --> 17:13.275
Right? And, oh, my God,
it looks like...

17:13.944 --> 17:16.248
(sighs) it feels like,
it smells like

17:16.281 --> 17:18.587
Moisés Alou gonna
grab that fuckin' thing

17:18.620 --> 17:20.724
and the Cubs are gonna be
four outs from the pennant.

17:20.757 --> 17:24.131
But instead, just as
Moisés is jumping for the ball,

17:24.164 --> 17:26.603
a fan in the stands
inches from Moisés

17:26.636 --> 17:29.474
does what any goddamn
fuckin' person would do

17:29.508 --> 17:31.478
with a goddamn fuckin' ball

17:31.512 --> 17:33.517
flying towards him in a
major league sporting venue.

17:33.550 --> 17:35.286
He tries to catch it.

17:35.821 --> 17:38.527
But his glove
bumps into Moisés' glove,

17:38.560 --> 17:41.098
the fucking ball drops,
and end of play.

17:41.131 --> 17:42.233
Fuck you, Cubbies.

17:43.369 --> 17:44.505
Bartman.

17:44.538 --> 17:45.841
-Bartman.
-CARMY: Yeah.

17:45.874 --> 17:48.478
And everyone wants
to kill little Stevie Bartman.

17:48.913 --> 17:50.718
But Alex Gonzalez's fuckup,

17:50.751 --> 17:53.422
trust me,
it's the real fuckup, right?

17:53.455 --> 17:55.126
Led to eight other fuckups.

17:55.159 --> 17:57.397
But then all of a sudden,
all those fuckups are a wash

17:57.430 --> 17:58.600
'cause of Steven Bartman,

17:58.633 --> 18:00.436
'cause everybody
and their mother

18:00.469 --> 18:01.806
wants to blame
this fucking guy

18:01.839 --> 18:04.545
instead of the actual
fuckin' motherfuckin' fuckups

18:04.578 --> 18:05.747
who fucked it up.

18:07.483 --> 18:10.256
Just a normal guy, right?

18:10.289 --> 18:11.826
You know, with
normal fuckin' headphones

18:11.859 --> 18:13.496
just reaching for a foul ball...

18:14.865 --> 18:17.270
on a lovely night at Wrigley,

18:17.303 --> 18:20.143
and he ends up
taking the blame
for an entire squad

18:20.176 --> 18:22.881
who literally
took their eye off the ball.

18:26.589 --> 18:28.893
Okay. So we don't
wanna be Bartman, right?

18:29.562 --> 18:32.668
No, dumbass.
You don't wanna be Gonzalez.

18:32.701 --> 18:34.404
You don't wanna be unfocused.

18:34.437 --> 18:36.308
-Are you even fuckin'--
-Alright. Yeah. Yeah.

18:36.341 --> 18:38.613
CICERO:
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen.

18:38.646 --> 18:40.951
You wanna be the guy, right?

18:40.984 --> 18:43.288
-CARMY: Yeah.
-So be the fuckin' guy.

18:46.796 --> 18:49.836
This business, like a lot
of businesses, it sucks, right?

18:49.869 --> 18:51.740
But this one sucks extra hard

18:51.773 --> 18:53.744
'cause the profit margins
are non-existent.

18:53.777 --> 18:55.446
-CARMY: Hmm.
-Right?

18:55.479 --> 18:57.618
And unforced errors,
trust me, they're contagious.

18:57.651 --> 18:59.722
So you don't have the luxury

18:59.755 --> 19:01.425
of hiding behind
little Stevie Bartman.

19:01.458 --> 19:02.694
It is all you.

19:03.863 --> 19:05.333
It's all you. Right?

19:05.366 --> 19:06.603
So you gotta put
your fuckin' head down.

19:06.636 --> 19:09.240
You gotta focus, and you gotta
live this shit and nothin' else.

19:13.516 --> 19:15.353
I actually want this place
to work for you, buddy.

19:15.386 --> 19:16.354
I really do.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.426
I don't wanna,
I don't wanna take it from you.

19:18.459 --> 19:19.562
I don't wanna knock it down.

19:19.595 --> 19:20.764
I will take it from you,

19:20.797 --> 19:22.300
I will knock it the fuck down.

19:22.333 --> 19:23.402
I don't wanna.

19:23.435 --> 19:24.972
But if this is
gonna work for you,

19:25.005 --> 19:26.576
you gotta give up
every fuckin' minute,

19:26.609 --> 19:27.845
every drop of blood you have.

19:27.878 --> 19:30.182
You cannot
take your eyes off this thing.

19:31.986 --> 19:33.556
And in return, you know
what you're gonna get?

19:34.290 --> 19:37.498
A nice, sharp kick
in your little nuts daily

19:37.531 --> 19:39.501
for the foreseeable future.

19:42.373 --> 19:44.343
Now how is that
all soundin' to you?

19:50.055 --> 19:51.424
I, um...

19:54.532 --> 19:56.201
I've actually kinda
been dating someone.

19:58.673 --> 20:00.877
-Really?
-Yeah.

20:01.746 --> 20:03.348
CICERO: No shit.

20:05.821 --> 20:08.259
I gotta tell you, nephew,
I don't know if I've
ever been so happy

20:08.292 --> 20:09.729
to hear anything
in my entire fuckin' life.

20:09.762 --> 20:12.935
And I say the following
with all the love of my heart.

20:12.968 --> 20:13.903
CARMY: Hmm.

20:14.905 --> 20:15.840
Uh-oh.

20:17.076 --> 20:18.780
CORTEZ:
Family meal up front, y'all.

20:18.813 --> 20:20.383
-SUGAR: Hey.
-Hi.

20:20.416 --> 20:22.688
You okay on the puntarelle sub?

20:22.721 --> 20:25.627
Yeah. Are you okay
on, like, life?

20:25.660 --> 20:26.962
Yeah. Yeah.

20:27.396 --> 20:29.267
I just haven't eaten.

20:29.300 --> 20:30.637
Oh, let me
make you something.

20:30.670 --> 20:32.006
No, I can't.
I can't let you do that.

20:32.039 --> 20:33.342
What are you talking about?
There's...

20:33.375 --> 20:34.511
What-what do you want?

20:35.614 --> 20:37.585
An omelet?

20:37.618 --> 20:39.287
Yeah, I can make you an omelet.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.524
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Go wait in the office.

20:40.557 --> 20:42.026
Hey, thank you.

20:43.061 --> 20:44.665
Ohh. (sighs)

21:55.039 --> 21:56.041
Hi.

21:56.074 --> 21:57.510
SUGAR:
(exhales) Hi!

21:58.680 --> 21:59.982
Oh-oh-oh.

22:09.602 --> 22:10.670
Mm.

22:12.106 --> 22:15.379
I could cry. Honestly.

22:15.412 --> 22:17.349
You're so good. Thank you.

22:19.053 --> 22:20.523
(Sugar sighs)

22:21.358 --> 22:23.796
-Okay. Don't watch me eat.
-I-I... Okay.

22:25.700 --> 22:26.936
You're a fucking genius.

22:26.969 --> 22:28.405
Shut the fuck up.

22:29.174 --> 22:30.644
MAN (over phone):
...keep fruits and vegetables

22:30.677 --> 22:33.583
separate from
raw meat, poultry and...

22:33.616 --> 22:34.718
EBRA: Makes sense.

22:35.052 --> 22:37.156
MAN: Produce should
always be washed...

22:37.189 --> 22:39.595
-Excellent.
-MAN: ...before combining it
with other ingredients.

22:40.063 --> 22:43.035
So you'll also wanna clean
and sanitize the prep sink

22:43.068 --> 22:45.039
and work area before starting.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.140
I accept.

22:51.786 --> 22:52.787
(buzzing)

22:54.223 --> 22:55.794
(line ringing)

22:55.827 --> 22:57.797
(buzzing continues)

23:03.876 --> 23:05.479
(buzzing continues)

23:06.749 --> 23:08.085
-MARCUS: Yo, Carm.
-Chef.

23:08.118 --> 23:09.788
-MARCUS: Try this.
-CARMY: Yeah. Yeah.

23:14.732 --> 23:15.733
Mm. (sighs)

23:16.201 --> 23:18.171
-Bravo, Chef. Good.
-Thank you, Chef.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.044
Uh, 30 minutes to open, Chefs.

23:21.077 --> 23:21.946
ALL: Chef!

23:21.979 --> 23:24.083
(phone buzzes)

23:25.754 --> 23:27.958
SYDNEY:
Marcus, this is...

23:27.991 --> 23:30.229
(scoffs) incredible.

23:30.262 --> 23:31.799
Thank you, Chef.

23:31.832 --> 23:32.968
-It's all you.
-Fuck you talking about?

23:33.001 --> 23:34.070
It's all you, dude.

23:34.103 --> 23:35.607
MARCUS:
Yeah. You pushed me.

23:35.640 --> 23:37.578
Okay, because you
let me push you.

23:37.611 --> 23:38.680
That's because you know me.

23:38.713 --> 23:40.016
Ok... Uh, no, no.

23:40.049 --> 23:41.753
We're not doing, like,
a corny fuckin' back and forth.

23:41.786 --> 23:42.755
What are you,
what are you doing later?

23:42.788 --> 23:43.790
SYDNEY: Well, when's later?

23:43.823 --> 23:44.992
I don't know, like, after work.

23:45.025 --> 23:47.598
I'll probably fuckin' barf,
like, 40 times.

23:47.631 --> 23:49.802
Okay, well,
would you want to go eat

23:49.835 --> 23:53.208
before that or after
or in between?

23:53.241 --> 23:56.983
Uh, well, I don't know
if there's time.

23:57.016 --> 24:00.222
Also, uh, we have to drill this
with, like, the servers,

24:00.255 --> 24:01.793
so I'm gonna get them
and then,

24:01.826 --> 24:03.897
and then let's run through, um,

24:03.930 --> 24:05.967
just ingredients, any allergies.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.644
Um, that wasn't... that wasn't
like an ask out or anything?

24:10.677 --> 24:11.746
-MARCUS: No, no. No.
-Yeah.

24:11.779 --> 24:13.048
No, no, no, no. I-I just...

24:13.081 --> 24:14.184
Sorry. I just wanted
to make sure.

24:14.217 --> 24:15.587
That would be weird.

24:15.620 --> 24:16.956
I don't know why I, like,
assumed you're--

24:16.989 --> 24:18.258
-Weird?
-SYDNEY: No, no, no, no, no.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.995
-Not-not-not weird, obviously.
-Uh-huh.

24:20.028 --> 24:22.668
No, um, I just more meant...
You know what I meant.

24:22.701 --> 24:24.103
-MARCUS: Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

24:24.672 --> 24:27.276
Let's... I'm gonna...
This was very good.

24:27.309 --> 24:28.613
-This was very good.
-Cool.

24:28.646 --> 24:29.548
SYDNEY:
Uh, thank you, Chef.

24:29.581 --> 24:31.952
Okay. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

24:32.954 --> 24:34.090
Fuck.

24:47.249 --> 24:48.886
First day, lizards.

24:49.788 --> 24:51.124
I wanna thank you guys.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.195
Thank you all so much
for all your hard work.

24:53.228 --> 24:54.799
There's nowhere else
in the world

24:54.832 --> 24:56.301
I'd rather be than right here,
right now with you guys.

24:56.334 --> 24:58.673
We are in the fortunate position

24:58.706 --> 25:02.581
of being able to
blow some fuckin' minds tonight.

25:02.614 --> 25:04.117
But in order to do that,

25:04.150 --> 25:05.587
we gotta read
some minds, alright?

25:05.620 --> 25:07.724
-Neil, how do we do that?
-We read the room.

25:07.757 --> 25:08.993
RICHIE:
Yeah. How do we do that?

25:09.026 --> 25:10.931
We read, uh, facial expressions.

25:10.964 --> 25:12.668
We listen for verbal cues.

25:12.701 --> 25:15.005
We wanna be
inside of people's minds.

25:15.038 --> 25:16.876
RICHIE:
Yeah. We ask questions, right?

25:16.909 --> 25:19.013
Not too many.
We be fuckin' nice.

25:19.046 --> 25:21.853
We remember names.
We remember everything.

25:21.886 --> 25:24.290
Alright? When we
walk into this room,

25:24.323 --> 25:29.702
we enter into
a state of profound,
heightened sensitivity.

25:29.735 --> 25:31.037
Now, who remembers

25:31.639 --> 25:35.012
what Vasudeva,
the ferryman, said to Siddartha

25:35.045 --> 25:36.749
on the banks
of the Ganges River?

25:38.018 --> 25:41.224
He whispered, "Listen better."

25:42.326 --> 25:43.729
And that's what we're gonna do.

25:44.163 --> 25:47.002
He also said water glasses
are always full.

25:47.369 --> 25:51.244
Somebody gets up,
that napkin gets folded,
placed on the seat.

25:51.277 --> 25:54.819
If someone looks bored,
make 'em fuckin' not bored.

25:54.852 --> 25:57.123
You know?
If the food's taking too long,

25:57.156 --> 25:59.060
make that food
not take too long.

25:59.093 --> 26:01.198
If someone looks cold,
Gary, what do you do?

26:01.231 --> 26:02.935
We make them not cold.

26:02.968 --> 26:06.141
That's right.
But don't make 'em ask.

26:06.174 --> 26:09.982
Listen, you know.
Watch. Execute. Alright?

26:10.015 --> 26:12.153
We're gonna be
streets ahead tonight.

26:12.186 --> 26:16.294
Anticipation
creates luxuriation.

26:18.098 --> 26:19.166
Yeah.

26:20.102 --> 26:21.170
Yeah.

26:22.006 --> 26:25.613
Fuckin'...
abra-fuckin'-cadabra, Chefs.

26:26.181 --> 26:27.383
-Cousin?
-Yeah. Beautiful.

26:27.416 --> 26:28.653
Thank you.
Thank you, cousin.

26:28.686 --> 26:31.959
Um, okay, so, uh...

26:31.992 --> 26:34.230
Tonight is
dress rehearsal, right?

26:34.263 --> 26:38.038
Um, it is designed
to find the cracks.

26:38.071 --> 26:40.810
Um, we're gonna
be doing a tasting menu.

26:40.843 --> 26:44.083
It's nine courses.
That's the best way
to practice, okay?

26:44.116 --> 26:45.820
Uh, it's gonna be crazy.

26:45.853 --> 26:47.356
It's gonna be overwhelming.

26:47.389 --> 26:50.296
That is the point.
Do not get crazy.

26:50.329 --> 26:52.099
Do not get overwhelmed, alright?

26:52.132 --> 26:55.907
I want you guys
to just try to... focus.

26:56.408 --> 26:58.212
-Okay?
-ALL: Chef!

26:58.245 --> 27:01.084
CARMY:
Yes. Um, mistakes will be made
so we can learn from them.

27:01.117 --> 27:02.854
We're all here to learn, right?

27:02.887 --> 27:04.692
I want us to remind our guests

27:04.725 --> 27:07.129
that there are
no checks tonight, okay?

27:07.162 --> 27:09.200
We've got Gary and Neil
over here.

27:09.233 --> 27:10.269
They're our captains.

27:10.302 --> 27:11.672
They're gonna be
floating around.

27:11.705 --> 27:14.344
Uh, Nat's gonna be
in the front of house.

27:14.377 --> 27:16.782
Uh, I'm gonna be in the back
should you need anything.

27:16.815 --> 27:18.051
Uh, thank you.
Thank you, guys.

27:18.084 --> 27:19.120
-Thanks so much.
-SYDNEY: Chefs.

27:19.153 --> 27:20.790

of escarole

27:28.940 --> 27:31.144

for puntarelle.

27:31.177 --> 27:33.482
And, uh, there's
a new addition to the menu.

27:33.516 --> 27:37.858
The, uh, mortadella
and parmesan cannoli,

27:37.891 --> 27:40.796
uh, with a mostarda caviar.

27:41.330 --> 27:42.466
"Caviar." It's not really...

27:42.500 --> 27:44.170
-(Sugar chuckles)
-Thanks.

27:44.203 --> 27:48.312
Um, and also we have
a pistachio crush on that.

27:48.345 --> 27:50.349
So, you know,
if you have any questions,

27:50.382 --> 27:52.888
feel free
to ask me or, uh, Chef.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.390
But, yeah. Thank you.

27:54.423 --> 27:55.860
-ALL: Chef!
-CARMY: Thanks, Chef.

27:55.893 --> 27:56.796
SUGAR: Sounds good.

27:56.829 --> 27:59.067
Uh, last reminder, A, B, C.

27:59.100 --> 28:01.404
Always Be Communicating. Okay?

28:01.437 --> 28:03.241
I want the front to know
what the back is up to,

28:03.274 --> 28:06.214
and I want the back to know what
the front is up to at all times.

28:06.247 --> 28:08.786
Keep the notes moving,
keep the dials dialed

28:08.819 --> 28:10.456
and, yeah.

28:10.489 --> 28:11.892

28:19.541 --> 28:22.747
♪ ♪

28:42.854 --> 28:45.159
I'm so excited but I'm scared
but I'm so excited.

28:45.192 --> 28:47.096
I'm aware. I'm aware.
Stop talking.

28:47.129 --> 28:49.100
-You're moving around too much.
-And I'm lookin' really good.

28:49.133 --> 28:50.937

start calling me Chef.

28:50.970 --> 28:53.075
Well, I'ma keep

28:53.108 --> 28:54.812
Fak, can't find a screwdriver.
Can I get one, please?

28:54.845 --> 28:57.149
Does it look like I would know
where a screwdriver is?

28:57.182 --> 28:58.519
I'm front of house now.

28:58.552 --> 29:00.322

29:37.597 --> 29:39.200
-Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.
-(imitating gunfire)

29:39.233 --> 29:41.104
Bup, bup, bup, bup.
Read your mind.

29:41.137 --> 29:43.575
-Al Capone shit.

29:47.149 --> 29:48.452
-Hey, Syd.

29:48.485 --> 29:50.155
Hey, can you come here
help me for a sec?

29:50.188 --> 29:51.825
-Yeah, sure.
-Thanks.

29:53.161 --> 29:54.263
(Carmy sighs)

29:55.232 --> 29:57.336
Um, it's a little uneven.

29:57.369 --> 29:59.541
If you could just
get under here
and hold that top up.

29:59.574 --> 30:01.545
-Yep. Okay.
-Good?

30:01.578 --> 30:03.448
Oh... yeah.

30:10.028 --> 30:11.264
-No. You're good?
-Yeah, yeah.

30:11.297 --> 30:12.199
Good.

30:13.034 --> 30:14.036

30:15.973 --> 30:16.942
Look you, um...

You deserve my full focus.

30:23.321 --> 30:24.457
And I'm, uh, I'm sorry.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.394
-No, don't.
-It's just, it's, um...

30:27.497 --> 30:30.035
-It's not Claire's fault.
-I-I didn't s... I didn't...

30:30.068 --> 30:31.304
I don't think
it's Claire's fault.

30:31.337 --> 30:33.308
-No, I know.
I know. I'm just...
-Like...

30:33.341 --> 30:36.281
I'm just saying,
my attention shouldn't be split.
You know?

30:36.314 --> 30:38.952
It shouldn't have to be shared.
I understand.

30:40.990 --> 30:42.928
I don't want you to think
I was, like, being jealous

30:42.961 --> 30:44.932
or, like, bitter or whatever,

30:44.965 --> 30:48.104
because that's, like,
not the case at all.

30:48.706 --> 30:50.442
And like thank you
for-for saying that.

30:50.475 --> 30:53.115
And also, she was really nice.

30:53.148 --> 30:54.585
I'm sure she's great.

30:54.618 --> 30:56.353
She is. She is.
She's great.

30:57.590 --> 30:58.625
Yeah?

31:01.297 --> 31:02.232
Yeah.

31:04.270 --> 31:06.373
Yeah. She's so great
it scares the shit outta me.

31:07.309 --> 31:08.377
(sighs)

31:10.015 --> 31:12.186
I don't know why
