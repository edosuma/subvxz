WEBVTT

00:07.575 --> 00:10.078
(muffled clamoring)

00:10.178 --> 00:11.712
(muffled):
Do you understand?

00:11.812 --> 00:13.881
Sergeant Hanson,
do you understand?

00:13.981 --> 00:16.550
PIERCE:
Sergeant Hanson,
do you understand?

00:16.650 --> 00:18.219
Yes, Staff Sergeant.
I can't hear you!

00:18.319 --> 00:21.021
(shouting):
Yes, Staff Sergeant!
Rise to fight.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.990
(cheering, whooping)

00:24.925 --> 00:26.327
MARINE:
Come on!

00:27.128 --> 00:28.662
Let's go, Hanson!

00:28.762 --> 00:30.764
Semper fi, man! Take him out!
(indistinct shouting)

00:34.068 --> 00:35.603
Go, Hanson!

00:39.006 --> 00:40.474
Fight!

00:40.574 --> 00:43.277
(growling)
Swing!

00:43.377 --> 00:45.045
Damn it, Hanson, swing!

00:45.146 --> 00:47.181
Swing, swing!

00:47.281 --> 00:50.017
Hanson, I need
more from you!

00:50.118 --> 00:51.719
Come on, Hanson!

00:52.453 --> 00:54.322
Come on, damn it.
Get up!

00:54.422 --> 00:55.589
Damn it, Hanson, get up!

00:55.689 --> 00:58.326
Get up!
Come on, fight back!

00:58.426 --> 01:00.328
Aah!

01:00.428 --> 01:03.431
(distorted): Hanson!

01:03.531 --> 01:06.967
Fight back!

01:07.067 --> 01:09.770
Come on!

01:11.339 --> 01:12.573
(grunting)

01:13.774 --> 01:15.143
(groaning)
(high-pitched ringing)

01:15.243 --> 01:16.810
That's it, stay positive!

01:16.910 --> 01:19.747
Fight back.
Fight back, Hanson!

01:20.514 --> 01:22.183
(grunting)

01:23.050 --> 01:25.453
(whistle blows)
Hanson, stop!

01:27.655 --> 01:29.557
Hanson, stop!

01:34.962 --> 01:37.365
I said stop!

01:38.566 --> 01:40.234
When I blow
that whistle, that...

01:40.334 --> 01:41.235
Hanson?

01:41.335 --> 01:43.070
Hanson?

01:43.170 --> 01:44.838
(grunting)

01:46.240 --> 01:47.475
Corpsman!

01:47.575 --> 01:49.810
* *

02:07.928 --> 02:09.830
* *

02:39.059 --> 02:40.928
Okay, all right.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.432
All right, so we got this.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.334
Oh, snap.

02:46.434 --> 02:47.668
It's good, it's good.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.770
It's good, it's good. Hmm?

02:49.870 --> 02:51.439
Look at you,
look at you, little guy.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.507
Smiley face.
Dad's out here killing it.

02:53.607 --> 02:56.977
Good morning.
Who wants breakfast?

02:57.077 --> 02:58.045
That's not breakfast.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.579
It's a murder weapon.
Please.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.081
These are vegan.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.251
No animals were harmed in
the making of these doughnuts.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.385
Not talking about the animals.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.286
Besides, I already
made breakfast.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.554
Aw, that's so cute.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.021
But definitely not vegan.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.057
Well, Rosa's not vegan
and neither am I.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.725
Yeah, well, you take
a couple of bites

03:11.825 --> 03:14.194
of one of these babies
and you might be.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.728
No, Mom, don't put
the doughnut...
Come on, give it a shot.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.197
Mom, we talked about this.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.799
I'm really excited that
you moved so close...

03:18.899 --> 03:23.103
Yeah, I timed myself.
84 seconds door-to-door.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.172
I brought my laundry.

03:25.273 --> 03:26.340
84 seconds-- wow, that is...

03:26.440 --> 03:27.941
that is terrifyingly close.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.010
But, listen, Mom,
we agreed on this,

03:30.110 --> 03:32.680
that you would... we would talk
before you just dropped by.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.448
I did. I texted Kensi.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.849
Well, Kensi's not here.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.619
Wow, but you'd never know it
with all the mess.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.087
Stop touching that.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.590
She is at Quantico for a week
for a refresher course.

03:42.690 --> 03:45.359
Well, then it's
a good thing I'm here.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.560
Your hands must be full.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.061
I'll go help Rosa
get dressed.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.228
Uh, she's 16.

03:49.329 --> 03:50.698
Besides, I got
everything taken care of.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.433
All right? I made
a beautiful breakfast.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.634
I got, uh, an incredible

03:53.734 --> 03:55.303
bento box
ready to go.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.537
Look how pretty
that is.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.671
And in 12 minutes,
we're walking

03:57.771 --> 03:59.072
out the door
to go to school

03:59.172 --> 04:01.241
if she would just wake up
and come eat breakfast!

04:01.342 --> 04:03.877
I brought donuts!
No, Mom.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.379
What do you got
against doughnuts?

04:05.479 --> 04:06.914
Weren't you a cop?

04:07.014 --> 04:08.549
How d...

04:08.649 --> 04:11.352
Ah, sleepy head. You okay?

04:11.452 --> 04:12.986
No me siento bien.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.422
Really?

04:14.522 --> 04:15.423
(coughs)

04:15.523 --> 04:17.757
(gags)

04:19.560 --> 04:20.894
Rosa?

04:20.994 --> 04:22.763
(retching)

04:24.598 --> 04:26.334
Well. I don't
speak Spanish,

04:26.434 --> 04:28.669
but I'm pretty sure
I know what that means.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.771
(Rosa coughing)

04:36.644 --> 04:38.145
(door closes)

04:38.245 --> 04:39.347
(exhales)

04:39.447 --> 04:41.749
Good run?
Yeah, it was good.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.817
Santa Ana was strong today.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.018
What are you doing?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.687
I'm looking at some
satellite footage

04:46.787 --> 04:49.657
of the town in Syria
where Hetty was last seen.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.425
Hoping maybe I can find
some trace of her.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.761
Gonna need a powerful satellite
to pick up someone her size.

04:53.861 --> 04:54.995
CALLEN: It's incredible.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.430
I mean, Hetty's gone
off the grid before,

04:56.530 --> 04:59.500
but this is, uh,
this is next-level.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.102
We'll find her, G.
We always do.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.572
(hissing nearby)

05:14.081 --> 05:16.249
G, why is there a snake
on the coffee table?

05:16.350 --> 05:18.185
Oh, yeah, that's,
uh, my nephew Jake's.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.853
He and Alex went
out of town this morning

05:19.953 --> 05:22.122
so I'm, uh... I'm pet-sitting.

05:22.222 --> 05:23.691
So, you had to bring it
to the boatshed?

05:23.791 --> 05:25.959
Well, I picked it up
on the way to work.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.396
I'll bring it home tonight.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.897
Everything okay?

05:31.064 --> 05:32.766
Oh, I forgot,
you're...

05:32.866 --> 05:33.801
you're afraid of snakes.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.403
I'm not afraid of snakes.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.770
I don't like snakes.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.739
What does that mean?

05:38.839 --> 05:41.742
What?
What-what do you mean?

05:41.842 --> 05:44.945
W-Why don't you like them?
Do I have to like them?

05:45.045 --> 05:46.980
Well, I... I don't know.
No, I guess.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.683
I just... I mean,
it seems a little unfair.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.352
It's not unfair.
It's survival instinct.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.521
A fear of snakes
is healthy.

05:53.621 --> 05:54.722
It's been passed down

05:54.822 --> 05:55.689
to humans
for thousands of years.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.090
Okay, so...

05:57.190 --> 05:58.291
you are afraid of snakes.
(phone vibrates)

05:58.392 --> 05:59.593
I gonna take a shower.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.094
Yeah, well...
This guy's bringing snakes

06:01.194 --> 06:02.696
to the office.
Make it quick.
We just got a case.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.231
(door closes)
DEEKS: Damn it.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.466
(Rosa coughing)

06:05.566 --> 06:06.900
Okay, I talked to the school.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.402
They think that you might have
caught the flu

06:08.502 --> 06:09.437
that's going around.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.071
Here, let's lift
your head up

06:11.171 --> 06:12.372
a little bit.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.107
How's that?
Is that better?
Mm.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.176
Okay, can I get you anything?
You want some-some toast

06:16.276 --> 06:17.811
or some coconut water
or ginger ale?

06:17.911 --> 06:19.212
I know--
I know the perfect thing.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.081
When I get sick,
I-I eat crunchy peanut butter

06:21.181 --> 06:22.650
right out of the jar.
Works every time.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.685
Ah, caldo de res.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.387
Sorry, what?

06:27.488 --> 06:29.557
It's a soup.

06:29.657 --> 06:33.060
My mom would make it for me
whenever I was sick.

06:33.159 --> 06:36.764
And she would
put her hand through my hair.

06:37.598 --> 06:38.799
Like this.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.134
Until I fell asleep.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.475
(sighs)
Sorry.

06:47.575 --> 06:50.511
No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that she's not here.

06:50.611 --> 06:54.381
And I'm sorry that I didn't
have a chance to meet her.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.685
She would have liked you.
Yeah?

06:57.784 --> 07:00.554
Yeah.
E-Except your hair.

07:00.654 --> 07:04.224
Well, you know...
She would have
combed it all neat.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.126
(laughing):
You would've looked terrible.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.796
(chuckling)
Yeah. Well, yeah.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.131
This is style by pillow.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.566
(phone vibrates)

07:12.666 --> 07:15.302
Sorry.
Work?

07:15.402 --> 07:17.137
Yeah.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.606
I got to take it.
Sorry.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.440
Rountree, hey.
Um, I'm-I'm coming.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.544
Uh, Rosa is sick and so we're
just waiting on my Mom to...

07:23.644 --> 07:25.278
I'm back.
And there she is.

07:25.378 --> 07:26.880
With the movies!
DEEKS: I'm on my way.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.448
Just hold down the fort.
All right, buddy.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.817
And the good news is

07:29.917 --> 07:32.284
I got my 84 seconds
down to a cool 43.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.387
I found a shortcut through
a neighbor's backyard.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.490
Okay, we'll just have to add
that to the list of things

07:36.590 --> 07:38.759
we need to discuss, but
right now I just, I need to...

07:38.859 --> 07:39.893
ROBERTA: Go.
go.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.062
I got this.
Just in case.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.564
(laughs)

07:43.664 --> 07:44.698
We're gonna have a great time.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.299
Hey.

07:46.399 --> 07:51.171
I love you.
And I am so sorry.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.742
Where do we start?

07:54.842 --> 07:56.977
I've been on a
Paul Newman kick lately.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.411
Lately being
the last 50 years.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.048
Oh, you think you got
a fever now, honey?

08:01.148 --> 08:04.685
Wait'll you meet
the cool hand of Mr. Luke.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.253
(chuckling)

08:06.353 --> 08:08.055
(purrs)

08:11.058 --> 08:12.392
This is Camp Pendleton
yesterday.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.427
And that's Private First Class
Edward Hanson

08:14.528 --> 08:15.529
in the blue helmet.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.064
A corp videographer
was filming

08:17.164 --> 08:18.065
for promotional purposes.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.432
Pugil stick training.

08:19.533 --> 08:22.469
I did this during
SEAL training at Coronado.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.172
Looks like fun.
It isn't.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.775
This guy's beast.
Look at him go.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.544
Until he suffered
a massive seizure.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.946
They got Hanson to the naval
hospital within minutes,

08:33.046 --> 08:34.881
but he quickly fell into a coma

08:34.982 --> 08:37.116
and now his organs
are failing.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.385
I'm assuming he doesn't
have a history of seizures.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.388
No. Doctors believe
that he suffered

08:41.488 --> 08:44.424
an intense immunological
response to something.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.726
Nerve agent?

08:45.826 --> 08:47.227
Well, that's what
they thought at first,

08:47.327 --> 08:50.263
and then they found traces
of an adenovirus in his blood.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.865
Don't they give you
cold symptoms?

08:51.965 --> 08:52.866
ROUNTREE:
Usually. But

08:52.966 --> 08:54.301
this virus specifically

08:54.401 --> 08:57.004
was found to be carrying
the CRISPR/cas9 enzyme.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.205
CALLEN:
Hold on.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.406
Isn't that used
for gene editing?

08:59.506 --> 09:00.407
FATIMA:
Exactly.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.142
Someone engineered the virus

09:02.242 --> 09:04.277
to be a delivery vehicle
for CRISPR.

09:04.377 --> 09:08.315
And then they introduced it into
a member of our armed forces.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.483
I just got off the phone
with SECNAV.

09:10.584 --> 09:13.186
Everyone from
the secretary of defense

09:13.286 --> 09:16.523
to the joint chiefs
wants us to find out where

09:16.624 --> 09:20.193
and how PFC Hanson was exposed
and who is responsible.

09:20.293 --> 09:24.564
This case has just taken on
the highest of priorities.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.134
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:27.234 --> 09:29.770
the United States
may have just suffered

09:29.870 --> 09:33.106
its first attack
by a genetic weapon.

09:43.415 --> 09:44.652
DEEKS:
Wait, a genetic weapon?

09:44.752 --> 09:46.253
Is this for real?
Mm-hmm.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.387
Just when you thought
you didn't have

09:47.487 --> 09:48.656
anything else to worry about.

09:48.756 --> 09:49.690
Right. The virus
carrying the CRISPR--

09:49.790 --> 09:51.224
is it contagious?
It's not.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.359
Good morning.
Yeah.

09:52.459 --> 09:53.661
Neutralized viruses
are often used

09:53.761 --> 09:55.462
to introduce
gene therapies into cells.

09:55.562 --> 09:57.297
The virus itself
is harmless.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.766
It just delivered
the CRISPR payload.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.433
Yeah, doctors found
what they suspect

10:00.533 --> 10:02.736
is an injection site
on PFC Hanson's arm.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.005
They still don't know what genes
it was specifically targeting,

10:05.105 --> 10:07.174
but whatever it was,
he's not doing well.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.575
So, who has
these capabilities?

10:08.676 --> 10:10.043
Well, we know Iran has
expressed interest.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.611
Mm. Russia, too.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.881
And a few years ago, a
Chinese researcher used CRISPR

10:13.981 --> 10:16.149
to genetically alter
human embryos.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.417
But the scary thing about this

10:17.517 --> 10:19.119
is anybody can
play around with it.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.520
You can order it online.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.990
Yeah, but still, to pull
something like this off,

10:23.090 --> 10:25.558
you'd need advanced knowledge
of genetic medicine.

10:25.659 --> 10:26.927
Which begs the question,

10:27.027 --> 10:28.829
why using it
on a marine private?

10:28.929 --> 10:31.364
Exactly. Why not
a captain or a general?

10:31.464 --> 10:33.901
Or an admiral?
Excuse me?

10:34.001 --> 10:35.302
Ooh, uh...

10:35.402 --> 10:37.304
Not an admiral like you, sir.
You're retired.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.073
Am I, Agent Rountree?

10:40.173 --> 10:42.009
I must be doing it wrong.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.645
Have Callen and Sam
arrived at Pendleton?

10:45.746 --> 10:47.614
Yes, sir.
Good.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.850
I just learned that
PFC Hanson's mother

10:49.950 --> 10:51.752
flew in yesterday from Indiana

10:51.852 --> 10:53.787
and is joining him
at the hospital.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.456
Agent Rountree,
I need you to speak with her.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.025
Yes, sir.

10:58.125 --> 11:01.228
Agent Namazi, find out
everything PFC Hanson has done

11:01.328 --> 11:02.362
for the last week.

11:02.462 --> 11:03.430
On it.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.965
What about me?
You...

11:05.065 --> 11:07.134
Yeah, me.
I would like to see
show up on time

11:07.234 --> 11:08.568
for once in your life.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.237
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
It was just...

11:10.337 --> 11:12.072
I don't care what it was.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.974
I realize
after 13 years

11:14.074 --> 11:18.045
this place may seem like
your own personal clubhouse,

11:18.145 --> 11:20.380
but you are still
a federal investigator

11:20.480 --> 11:22.249
with a rather important job,

11:22.349 --> 11:25.252
and your tardiness, as much
as I hate to admit it,

11:25.352 --> 11:28.121
is a detriment to
this office's mission.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.256
Am I clear?

11:29.356 --> 11:30.557
Crystal.
Good.

11:30.657 --> 11:33.060
You will join Agent Rountree--

11:33.160 --> 11:34.828
who is hiding
behind that pillar--

11:34.928 --> 11:39.800
and find out if PFC Hanson's
mother knows anything.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.169
DEEKS:
Yes, sir.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.537
(sighs)

11:49.709 --> 11:50.811
Yeah, he's been talking
with the Pentagon

11:50.911 --> 11:52.746
all morning.
I don't think he knows

11:52.846 --> 11:55.648
anything about
Rosa being sick.
Yeah, let's roll.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.920
DRILL SERGEANT:
Let's go! Move! Move! Move!

12:00.020 --> 12:01.588
Adler, you're next on the line!

12:01.688 --> 12:03.056
ADLER:
Yes, sir!

12:03.156 --> 12:05.625
My mama has three words
for people like Eddie Hanson:

12:05.725 --> 12:07.460
"bless his heart."

12:07.560 --> 12:09.462
Nothing seemed to come
easy to him.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.398
Physically, he's been
struggling to keep up.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.500
Really? Well, it
didn't look that

12:13.600 --> 12:14.868
in the training session video.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.104
Yeah, he surprised us all
yesterday, but

12:17.204 --> 12:19.406
after he collapsed,
I thought that...

12:19.506 --> 12:21.474
maybe I pushed him too hard.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.844
I can promise you
it wasn't that.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.080
Listen, they won't
tell us anything,

12:27.180 --> 12:29.382
but suddenly we all
had to give blood tests

12:29.482 --> 12:31.218
this morning, now NCIS is here.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.753
I got a wife and a baby.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.956
We don't think there's an
immediate threat to anyone else.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.324
The blood tests
are just a precaution.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.892
Although it would
be helpful

12:38.992 --> 12:40.928
if we knew everything
Hanson was up to last week.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.896
I can send you his work
and training schedule,

12:42.996 --> 12:44.531
but for his liberty activities,

12:44.631 --> 12:47.100
you'll need to talk to his
roommate, PFC James Williams.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.836
(chuckles) Them two
are like birds of a feather.

12:48.936 --> 12:49.837
They went everywhere together.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.571
Off base?
Oh, yeah.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.874
Hanson's one of the few
PFCs with a car.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.276
Yellow Camaro.
Gorgeous but loud, you know?

12:56.376 --> 12:58.078
You knew when Hanson
was going somewhere,

12:58.178 --> 12:59.679
and Williams
was always with him.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.381
When was the last time
they left together?

13:01.481 --> 13:03.483
Night before Hanson's collapse.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.919
I caught staff duty
at battalion, saw them leave.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.454
Do you know where they went?

13:07.554 --> 13:10.190
Long as they make it back
sober and safe, I don't ask.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.691
But I'm sure Williams
will tell you.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.026
I can call over
to his work section.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.661
We'd appreciate that,
Staff Sergeant.

13:14.761 --> 13:16.629
You can have them send him over
to the barracks.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.131
We're gonna check out
Hanson's rack.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.099
Roger that.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.467
All right.
Thank you.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.002
Thanks.

13:23.036 --> 13:25.172
Excuse me, Mrs. Hanson?

13:25.272 --> 13:26.139
Yes?
Hi.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.507
I'm, uh, Investigator Deeks.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.709
This is Special Agent Rountree.
We're with NCIS.

13:29.809 --> 13:30.978
We talked to somebody upstairs,

13:31.078 --> 13:32.412
they said we'd find you
down here.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.147
Sorry, I-I needed
a moment.

13:34.247 --> 13:37.450
It's really hard to see
your child like that.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.819
You know, he's so sick.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.755
I can't even imagine.
I'm sorry,

13:42.856 --> 13:45.325
why is NCIS here?

13:45.425 --> 13:47.760
Eddie suffered a seizure.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.629
I mean, didn't he?
Yes, ma'am,

13:49.729 --> 13:51.198
but it's possible
he came in contact

13:51.298 --> 13:53.033
with something
that caused the seizure,

13:53.133 --> 13:54.801
so We're trying to determine
what that might be.

13:54.902 --> 13:55.936
DEEKS:
Do you mind if we

13:56.036 --> 13:57.971
sit down,
ask you a few questions?

13:58.071 --> 13:59.706
Yeah.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.477
When's the last time
you spoke to Eddie?

14:04.577 --> 14:06.146
He calls every Saturday

14:06.246 --> 14:08.281
at 9:00 a.m.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.050
He's a good boy.

14:10.150 --> 14:13.620
I was so proud
when he joined the Marines.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.422
Just like his daddy.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.325
He, uh, died in combat.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.493
I'm sorry to hear that.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.763
So when, um, Eddie calls,
what is it you guys talk about?

14:23.863 --> 14:25.198
I don't know.

14:25.298 --> 14:28.068
His day. My day.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.070
Our dog. Crypto.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.372
You have a dog named Crypto?

14:32.472 --> 14:36.209
(laughs) No.
No.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.046
Uh, we would-we would
talk about cryptocurrency.

14:39.146 --> 14:40.513
Oh.

14:40.613 --> 14:44.484
I know, I do not look like
your typical altcoiner.

14:44.584 --> 14:49.489
After Eddie's dad died,
I spent a lot of time online.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.926
It took a while, but after
I mined my first coin, ooh,

14:53.026 --> 14:55.662
I was hooked.
I think I like

14:55.762 --> 14:57.797
NomportaCoin best.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.467
But you know
what they say: DYOR.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.835
What do-what do they say?
D-O... What do you...

15:02.936 --> 15:04.204
Uh, "do your own research."

15:04.304 --> 15:06.439
Yeah, no. D... Do your...
DY... Yeah, right.

15:06.539 --> 15:10.010
I always do my own. So, does
Eddie-- he also mines crypto

15:10.110 --> 15:13.146
as well?
On, no, no, no.
That was never his thing.

15:14.381 --> 15:18.051
Until a few weeks ago,
when he called me

15:18.151 --> 15:21.288
and asked me to help him
set up an account

15:21.388 --> 15:22.956
at one of the exchanges.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.791
Did he say what it was for?
No.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.960
Something with
his roommate, James.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.861
He was on the call, too.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.231
He and Eddie-- they're so close.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.735
I thought I'd
see him here.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.040
CALLEN:
Dietary supplements
and car magazines.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.741
Probably just like
every other room

15:41.841 --> 15:43.043
in this barracks.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.045
It's what I'm not finding
that concerns me.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.014
No phone, for one thing.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.648
Well, he wouldn't have needed it
for the training session.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.150
It's got to be here somewhere.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.985
Don't see
Hanson's car keys, either.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.921
Why would someone take
his phone and his car, unle...

15:55.888 --> 15:57.690
Williams on his way?
'Fraid not, sir.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.893
Williams is UA. He didn't muster
for duty this morning.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.963
Thanks.
All right, thanks.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.066
Main gate surveillance cameras
show Hanson's Camaro

16:06.166 --> 16:07.634
leaving the base
about an hour ago.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.169
Last spotted heading north
on the 5.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.438
Talked to Deeks,
said Hanson and Williams

16:11.538 --> 16:13.540
recently opened a cryptocurrency
account together.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.176
You don't think
somebody paid them

16:16.276 --> 16:17.610
to bring CRISPR
into Pendleton, do you?

16:17.710 --> 16:20.513
Could be. Doesn't explain
what got Hanson sick.

16:20.613 --> 16:23.550
Maybe Williams got greedy,
wanted the money for himself.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.085
Now he's on the run.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.819
Except if I was him,
I'd head south for the border,

16:26.919 --> 16:28.321
not north to L.A.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.290
Unless he's got
a bigger target in mind.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.862
KILBRIDE:
I don't want excuses.

16:35.962 --> 16:38.265
Now, you get a chopper
in the air over the 5,

16:38.365 --> 16:40.267
or I will personally make sure
(knocks)

16:40.367 --> 16:41.968
that the president
knows it was you

16:42.069 --> 16:44.204
who let our suspect slip away.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.407
Tell me that you have
located PFC Williams.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.409
He was last seen exiting
into the Anaheim area,

16:49.509 --> 16:51.811
but I think I know
where he's heading.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.780
Hanson's mother
got us access to her son's

16:53.880 --> 16:55.248
NomportaCoin wallet.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.950
The thing is,
he wasn't receiving money.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.086
He was paying it out.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.554
He recently dispersed
three coins

17:01.654 --> 17:03.156
worth just over $2,000.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.858
To whom?
Well, it's crypto,
so it's anonymous.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.859
But bank accounts aren't.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.063
I accessed
the blockchain ledger,

17:10.163 --> 17:11.798
and I found out that
he recently converted

17:11.897 --> 17:14.134
the NomportaCoins
into U.S. currency

17:14.233 --> 17:15.902
and deposited them
into the bank account

17:16.002 --> 17:19.506
of a Xander Yost,
who lives in Anaheim.

17:19.606 --> 17:22.608
Get Deeks and Rountree
over there now.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.411
(tires screech)

17:27.747 --> 17:28.915
That's Hanson's Camaro.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.418
You take the back,
I'll take the front.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.423
Uh-oh.

17:36.523 --> 17:40.493
I got blood on the handle
and the door's unlocked.

17:41.628 --> 17:45.665
PFC Williams.
Federal agents.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.334
Deeks, he's running.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.141
(grunting)

18:02.849 --> 18:04.584
(coughing)
Stay down.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.119
I didn't kill him.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.820
You're right.
PFC Hanson isn't dead.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.457
No, not Hanson.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.249
Son of a bitch.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.396
Hey, how you, uh, how you
feeling? Able to eat anything?

18:49.496 --> 18:50.563
(coughing)

18:50.663 --> 18:52.131
That's okay.

18:52.232 --> 18:55.268
You just, uh, keep sipping
liquids. You take it slow.

18:55.368 --> 18:58.171
Yes, I know. It's not
my first time getting sick.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.173
Yeah, but it's my first time
with you getting sick,

19:00.273 --> 19:02.108
so I'm sorry, I apologize
for you having to deal with

19:02.209 --> 19:03.710
the incessant mothering.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.845
Speaking of mothers, yours wants
to talk to you right now.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.014
No, no, I don't...
Yeah. Hello, Martin?

19:08.114 --> 19:09.882
You know your
DVD player's broken?

19:09.982 --> 19:11.251
Mom, we don't have
a DVD player.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.785
Yes, you do.
No, we don't.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.121
Then what have I been shoving
my DVDs into

19:15.222 --> 19:16.489
for the past hour?

19:16.589 --> 19:18.658
Oh, my God. Mom, listen,
I got to go to work.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.193
Just make sure she's
drinking water.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.261
No, don't go. Don't go!

19:21.361 --> 19:22.729
I got to go. I love you. Bye!

19:22.829 --> 19:26.199
God!
(chuckles)

19:26.299 --> 19:27.567
How's Rosa?

19:27.667 --> 19:28.868
Well, besides the fact that

19:28.968 --> 19:30.237
she's trapped in a house
with a crazy person,

19:30.337 --> 19:31.538
she's feeling better.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.373
What did the, uh...
What'd the coroner say?

19:33.473 --> 19:36.108
Uh, well, they confirmed that
that is indeed Xander Yost,

19:36.209 --> 19:38.678
But they put his TOD
at about two hours ago.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.547
PFC Williams was
just leaving the base.

19:40.647 --> 19:41.848
It means he couldn't
have done it.
Yeah.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.149
Castor's on his way
to pick him up,

19:43.250 --> 19:44.751
and Kilbride wants us
to stay behind

19:44.851 --> 19:47.454
while they process the scene.
He is the boss.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.522
Indeed.
Indeed.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.558
FATIMA:
Xander Yost,

19:51.658 --> 19:54.527
med-school dropout,
dark web entrepreneur.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.764
Let me tell you, it took a bit
of digging to find him,

19:57.864 --> 20:01.268
but I found his site:
XY Apothecary.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.503
That's where he makes
homemade gene therapies,

20:03.603 --> 20:06.773
including a four-week
myostatin-inhibitor treatment

20:06.873 --> 20:08.575
that promotes the growth
of muscle cells.

20:08.675 --> 20:11.444
And for two people, it costs
exactly three NomportaCoins.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.212
That's the same amount that
Hanson and Williams

20:13.313 --> 20:14.581
paid out to Yost.

20:14.681 --> 20:15.615
Staff sergeant said that
Hanson and Williams

20:15.715 --> 20:17.450
were struggling to keep up.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.151
SAM:
All the supplements in their
room-- they were definitely

20:19.252 --> 20:20.953
looking for an answer.
These guys aren't terrorists.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.022
They were just trying
to enhance themselves.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.826
Question is
who murdered Yost?

20:26.926 --> 20:29.329
And why did the treatment
almost kill PFC Hanson?

20:30.563 --> 20:33.400
WILLIAMS:
We just wanted to be
better Marines. I swear.

20:33.500 --> 20:37.270
Stronger. Faster.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.907
So, yeah, we found XY

20:41.007 --> 20:43.576
and we did a few rounds
of shots.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.912
And it was all good. It was.

20:46.012 --> 20:50.583
It actually felt like we were
getting results, you know?

20:50.683 --> 20:53.219
But then Eddie got sick.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.887
And all day yesterday
I kept telling myself

20:54.987 --> 20:58.057
it wasn't
the gene therapy, but...

20:58.157 --> 20:59.659
This morning they called us up
for blood tests,

20:59.759 --> 21:01.861
and I freaked out.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.564
Started having trouble
breathing.

21:04.664 --> 21:08.200
I thought it was happening to
me, too, so I took Eddie's car.

21:08.301 --> 21:09.836
And his phone.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.004
We found it in the Camaro.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.606
He had the address for
Xander's house in his phone.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.509
I couldn't open it
without his face ID,

21:16.609 --> 21:18.845
but when you hook it up
to the car, you can get access.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.380
I was going to return
everything.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.915
I just needed a few hours
to get up there and get help.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.484
I thought maybe Xander
would have an antidote

21:24.584 --> 21:27.253
or something.

21:27.354 --> 21:30.757
But when I got there,
the door was open...

21:30.857 --> 21:33.393
and he was dead.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.861
So why'd you run?

21:34.961 --> 21:37.029
I thought the agent who chased
me might be the killer.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.431
He yelled "federal agent."
I know.

21:38.531 --> 21:39.699
But I just didn't
process it.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.268
I think I was having
a panic attack.

21:46.539 --> 21:49.308
Do you have any idea
who could have killed him?

21:49.409 --> 21:50.610
No.

21:50.710 --> 21:51.911
Because when we
searched his house,

21:52.011 --> 21:53.846
for a guy who sells
gene therapies,

21:53.946 --> 21:55.615
we didn't find many
gene therapies.

21:55.715 --> 21:58.385
CALLEN:
Meaning whoever killed him
cleared the place out.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.420
More people could
end up in the hospital,

22:00.520 --> 22:01.588
just like your friend Hanson.

22:01.688 --> 22:02.955
So if there's anything

22:03.055 --> 22:05.725
you could tell us...
I don't know anything.

22:07.627 --> 22:10.863
Sir.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.699
Did you talk to
Xander's assistant?

22:12.799 --> 22:14.834
Xander Yost had an assistant?

22:14.934 --> 22:17.937
Yes, sir.
A guy about my age.

22:18.705 --> 22:19.772
Name?

22:19.872 --> 22:22.709
No, sir.
I don't think he said.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.312
I only saw him at Xander's
the last time we went.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.616
But he gave Eddie and I these.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.884
He said it was
to track our heart rates,

22:31.984 --> 22:35.054
look for any fluctuations
after the treatment.

22:37.524 --> 22:38.825
KILBRIDE:
Was PFC Hanson

22:38.925 --> 22:41.260
wearing his monitor
when he suffered his seizure?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.830
Yes. Meaning whoever
was monitoring it

22:43.930 --> 22:45.498
would have known
he was in distress.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.767
Any leads
on who that might be?

22:47.867 --> 22:49.736
I traced the serial numbers
and discovered

22:49.836 --> 22:51.771
that they were purchased
by this organization:

22:51.871 --> 22:54.040
Open Source Bio,

22:54.140 --> 22:55.942
a community lab
in downtown L.A.

22:56.042 --> 22:59.145
DIY biologists,
also known as biohackers.
Yeah.

22:59.245 --> 23:02.849
I read a report by Homeland
Security on these people.

23:02.949 --> 23:07.787
Amateurs using powerful
chemical and biological tools,

23:07.887 --> 23:09.756
virtually unchecked
by authorities.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.958
I mean, as far as I can tell,

23:12.058 --> 23:13.860
Open Source Bio's primary goal

23:13.960 --> 23:15.628
is simply
to democratize science.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.964
(scoffs)
Yeah, they share knowledge
and conduct research

23:18.064 --> 23:20.232
without the financial support
of larger institutions.

23:20.332 --> 23:23.770
Well, while their goals
may be noble,

23:23.870 --> 23:26.506
it is easy to imagine
one bad apple

23:26.606 --> 23:30.242
using this access to
create something dangerous.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.612
And it may be where Xander Yost

23:32.712 --> 23:35.214
picked up his lab assistant.
Mm.

23:35.314 --> 23:36.983
I want you to infiltrate
this group.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.985
Find out whom
we're dealing with.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.821
And, uh, pick up
Agent Rountree on the way.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.089
Are you covering Ops again?

23:43.189 --> 23:46.258
Hell no.
Have Deeks report back here.

23:46.358 --> 23:48.895
(door closes)

23:51.464 --> 23:54.333
Hey, Fatima, thanks
for bringing my ride.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.235
I always keep snacks
in the glove box,

23:56.335 --> 23:58.605
and I have not had lunch today.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.907
Where are my Danger Bars?

24:03.109 --> 24:04.711
Mm, sorry about that.

24:04.811 --> 24:07.379
I haven't had lunch either.
That's why I brought your ride.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.115
Not cool.

24:11.383 --> 24:12.719
Huh. It's locked.

24:12.819 --> 24:16.789
Uh, you must be Miranda?

24:16.889 --> 24:18.991
Lisa Cho. We-we
spoke on the phone.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.927
Yes, of course.

24:21.027 --> 24:22.529
Thank you for meeting me

24:22.629 --> 24:23.863
on such short notice.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.131
Yeah, so you're starting
your own business?

24:25.231 --> 24:27.299
That's right.
My own line of kombucha.

24:27.399 --> 24:28.801
LISA:
Oh, I love kombucha.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.069
Okay, yeah,
we can definitely help.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.604
We work with SCOBYs
all the time.

24:31.704 --> 24:32.839
Uh, how about I show you around?

24:32.939 --> 24:36.809
Fabulous.
Pardon me.

24:36.909 --> 24:37.810
(panel beeps, lock clicks)

24:37.910 --> 24:40.379
How did you do that?

24:40.479 --> 24:41.748
It's pretty cool, right?

24:41.848 --> 24:43.950
RFID chip implanted
in my right hand,

24:44.050 --> 24:45.852
magnets in my left.
Mm.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.687
TSA must love you.

24:47.787 --> 24:50.056
But, um, why all the security?

24:50.156 --> 24:53.760
Uh, we work with some
pretty... hazardous materials.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.562
Hmm.
Follow me.

25:00.266 --> 25:02.869
Wow, very impressive.

25:02.969 --> 25:04.436
What sort of projects
do you work on here?

25:04.537 --> 25:07.406
Whatever our members
are interested in doing.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.709
Sometimes that includes
body modifications,

25:09.809 --> 25:12.144
uh, like my hand implants.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.914
But, uh, we also have a few
other community projects.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.482
We make vegan cheese,

25:16.583 --> 25:20.352
uh, biodegradable materials
out of mycelium,

25:20.452 --> 25:21.788
and our own insulin.

25:21.888 --> 25:24.156
Really?
You make medicine?

25:24.256 --> 25:26.192
Yeah. FDA approved
and everything.

25:26.292 --> 25:29.328
Uh, that's actually
how a lot of us met.

25:29.428 --> 25:31.097
We're diabetic.
(chuckles)

25:31.197 --> 25:33.800
the price of insulin
has skyrocketed

25:33.900 --> 25:36.836
in the last ten years,
so we decided

25:36.936 --> 25:38.304
to take the power away
from Big Pharma

25:38.404 --> 25:40.006
and bring it to the people.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.341
Oh, come here.
(clears throat)

25:42.441 --> 25:45.077
Hey, everyone,
uh, this is Miranda.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.679
She's thinking about
joining us.

25:46.779 --> 25:47.880
Hi.
Hey, Miranda.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.717
Miranda, hi.
How are you, Miranda?

25:50.817 --> 25:53.052
(footsteps approach)

25:56.589 --> 25:58.958
Hello?

25:59.058 --> 26:01.728
Oh, uh, sorry, this is Herman.

26:01.828 --> 26:04.797
Um, he is a cyborg.
A what?

26:04.897 --> 26:08.034
A cyborg.
Yes, we exist.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.236
Harbisson.
De Aguas. Moon Ribas.

26:10.336 --> 26:14.540
We strive to enhance our senses
using cybernetic implants.

26:14.641 --> 26:17.076
This device is an antenna.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.278
It's attached to
the back of my skull.

26:19.378 --> 26:21.447
With it, I can
intercept all manner

26:21.547 --> 26:25.551
of electromagnetic radiation,
including radio waves.

26:25.652 --> 26:27.954
Speaking of which,
I am detecting

26:28.054 --> 26:31.190
a very strange frequency...

26:32.591 --> 26:35.127
...coming from you.

26:35.227 --> 26:38.430
Lisa, this woman
is wearing a wire.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.100
She is a fed!

27:03.122 --> 27:05.124
Hang tight, Fatima,
I'm on my way.

27:05.224 --> 27:06.058
Herman, seriously?

27:06.158 --> 27:07.694
A fe-a fed?

27:07.794 --> 27:09.528
It happened
in San Francisco, Lisa.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.363
My DIY lab was infiltrated

27:11.463 --> 27:12.732
by an undercover FBI agent.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.600
They thought we were
making anthrax or sarin.

27:14.701 --> 27:17.069
Fascist monsters.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.838
Take off your hijab.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.239
Herman, that is out of line!

27:22.875 --> 27:24.844
No, no, it's quite all right.

27:24.944 --> 27:27.646
I am wearing an RF device.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.987
But I'm not a federal agent.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.356
It's another form
of biohacking.

27:37.456 --> 27:39.491
Like your antenna,

27:39.591 --> 27:41.060
or your heart rate monitor.

27:43.562 --> 27:44.997
I suffer from hyperacusis--

27:45.097 --> 27:47.399
noise sensitivity.
This device uses

27:47.499 --> 27:51.270
acoustic channels to reduce
noise and calm my anxiety.

27:51.370 --> 27:53.205
But if it makes you
more comfortable,

27:53.305 --> 27:54.306
I can turn it off.

27:54.406 --> 27:55.407
It would.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.608
Thank you.
LISA: No, Herman.

27:56.709 --> 27:57.609
We would not ask you

27:57.710 --> 27:58.878
to remove your antenna.

27:58.978 --> 28:00.412
Well, that
would be very painful.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.914
So we will not
be asking Miranda

28:02.014 --> 28:04.550
to remove her device. It
provides an essential function.

28:04.650 --> 28:06.753
Fine.

28:06.853 --> 28:09.221
But I'll be keeping
my eyes on you.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.257
All three of them.

28:14.126 --> 28:17.029
Yeah, um,
so sorry about Herman.

28:17.129 --> 28:20.266
He is brilliant,
he's just a little, um...

28:20.366 --> 28:21.533
paranoid about the government.

28:21.633 --> 28:24.670
Um, so I actually
have to prep and deliver

28:24.771 --> 28:26.005
our next shipment of insulin
for our customers,

28:26.105 --> 28:27.774
but, um, feel free
to take a look around,

28:27.874 --> 28:29.942
talk to anybody
about your project.
Mm.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.444
Except Herman.
Thanks, Lisa.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.681
ROUNTREE: Hyperacusis.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.249
I'm impressed, milady.
(chuckles)

28:37.349 --> 28:39.685
Heard what you said
about the heart rate monitor.

28:39.786 --> 28:42.188
Herman could be our guy.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.622
(shutter clicks)

28:43.722 --> 28:44.924
(phone chimes)
Got his photo.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.158
I'll get this over
to Sam and Callen.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.594
Maybe PFC Williams
can identify him.

28:48.694 --> 28:50.462
CALLEN:
How you doing, little guy?

28:50.562 --> 28:52.832
Come on, buddy. Come on.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.934
Come on, buddy.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.602
G, do you have
to do that now?

28:56.702 --> 28:57.904
I told Jake I'd feed him
this afternoon,

28:58.004 --> 28:59.238
but he doesn't seem
very hungry.

29:01.707 --> 29:03.209
No, sorry, it's not him.

29:03.309 --> 29:05.311
I would remember
if Xander's assistant

29:05.411 --> 29:07.713
was a giant with a wire
sticking out of his head.

29:09.315 --> 29:12.418
So, clothing, tattoos...

29:12.518 --> 29:13.786
what he drove to get there.

29:13.886 --> 29:17.857
A Copperhead.
That's actually a bald python.

29:17.957 --> 29:20.092
No, there was a bright orange
Copperhead motorcycle

29:20.192 --> 29:21.693
at Xander's house
two nights ago.

29:21.794 --> 29:23.162
Eddie commented on it.

29:23.262 --> 29:26.065
Thought it was cool.
It wasn't there the other times.

29:26.165 --> 29:27.699
Deeks.
DEEKS: Yo, buddy?

29:27.800 --> 29:29.268
Deeks, where are you?

29:29.368 --> 29:31.170
Oh.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.973
Sorry.
I was on the wrong computer.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.810
Does Xander Yost have
a Copperhead motorcycle?

29:37.910 --> 29:39.578
Uh, I did not
see one at the house

29:39.678 --> 29:42.648
and he doesn't have one
registered under his name, no.

29:42.748 --> 29:43.983
It could be his assistant's.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.484
Can you...
check the traffic cams

29:45.584 --> 29:48.254
in the area around the time
of Xander's murder?

29:48.354 --> 29:49.421
Already scrubbing.

29:49.521 --> 29:50.923
Scrub City. Scrub-a-dub-dub,

29:51.023 --> 29:52.892
two guys in the...
Okay.

29:52.992 --> 29:53.893
Yeah, no, I definitely got it.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.761
Pulling up the plate now.

29:55.862 --> 29:59.665
It's, uh, registered
to Nicholas Embry.

29:59.765 --> 30:01.067
I got an address for him,
but it looks like

30:01.167 --> 30:02.601
it's a shuttered
homeless shelter.

30:02.701 --> 30:04.803
Hold on a second.
He's also got a van.

30:04.904 --> 30:06.205
It was just ticketed
this morning

30:06.305 --> 30:09.241
in a public parking structure
in Sherman Oaks.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.043
Good work, Deeks.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.378
Yeah, no,
I definitely killed that.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.413
Although it was
mostly the computer.

30:14.513 --> 30:15.848
I just got hit F1 and then F6

30:15.948 --> 30:17.749
because Janice preprogram...
Janice,

30:17.850 --> 30:19.185
they said great work.
Bye, Deeks.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.887
Oh. Oh, yeah.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.856
Bye-bye, buddy.

30:28.627 --> 30:29.996
Hello.

30:30.096 --> 30:32.664
I couldn't help but notice
your heart rate monitor.

30:32.764 --> 30:33.900
Do you like it?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.434
My friend Nick
has the same one.

30:35.534 --> 30:37.336
He's actually the one
who recommended this place.

30:37.436 --> 30:38.804
You mean Nicholas Embry?

30:38.905 --> 30:43.075
Yes. Well, we're not
really friends.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.276
We went to university together

30:44.376 --> 30:46.078
and I ran into him
a few weeks ago.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.314
Why would Nicholas Embry
recommend this place?

30:48.414 --> 30:51.050
He left on very bad terms.
He wanted to

30:51.150 --> 30:53.953
use CRISPR and we told him
we don't do that here.

30:54.053 --> 30:56.455
He got angry, said he'd find
someplace that did.

30:56.555 --> 30:59.191
Though it doesn't surprise me
he took a heart rate monitor.

30:59.291 --> 31:00.893
We suspect he stole
a bunch of equipment

31:00.993 --> 31:02.794
on his way out of the door.
Wow, I...

31:02.895 --> 31:04.897
I had no idea.

31:04.997 --> 31:09.201
Well, pretty convenient,
you running into him.

31:12.238 --> 31:15.007
I still think you're a Fed.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.810
(antenna humming)

31:22.314 --> 31:24.883
All right,
there's Embry's van.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.256
The motorcycle's gone.

31:33.759 --> 31:35.761
I don't see anyone.

31:35.861 --> 31:37.997
Hey, Deeks, do we have
that warrant?

31:38.097 --> 31:39.298
DEEKS:
Good to rock and roll, boys.

31:39.398 --> 31:40.899
(window shatters)

31:42.334 --> 31:44.336
Hmm.

31:45.837 --> 31:48.307
This guy's living in here.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.876
Yeah, and working, too.

31:50.977 --> 31:52.844
SAM:
"21st Century Eugenics:"

31:52.945 --> 31:54.480
CALLEN:
"Using Modern Tools
to Exterminate

31:54.580 --> 31:57.416
Genetic Inferiority."

31:57.516 --> 31:59.718
This guy wants to
kill a lot more people.

31:59.818 --> 32:02.388
And now he has the tools
to do it.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.866
Find anything else?
Not yet.

32:14.967 --> 32:17.903
Just a lot of really
technical notes and research.

32:18.004 --> 32:20.239
Well, we know Nicholas Embry
wants to eliminate

32:20.339 --> 32:22.141
anyone he deems
genetically inferior,

32:22.241 --> 32:24.643
and he joined Open Source Bio
to get the tools he needed.

32:24.743 --> 32:27.980
Well, except they have rules
against working with CRISPR.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.615
So he joins up with Xander Yost,

32:29.715 --> 32:30.949
who doesn't much care for rules.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.884
Starts messing with
Xander's therapies,

32:32.985 --> 32:35.421
tracking his customers' health
data with heart rate monitors.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.023
When PFC Hanson got sick,

32:37.123 --> 32:39.191
Embry knew that
his CRISPR formula was right.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.393
Xander figured out what he was
doing and confronted him.

32:41.493 --> 32:43.395
Embry takes him out,
he steals the therapies.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.597
Question is, who is he
gonna use 'em on?

32:45.697 --> 32:47.866
Deeks, tell me you have
a location on Nicholas Embry.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.468
I wish that I could,
but I got no hits

32:49.568 --> 32:50.969
on his motorcycle,

32:51.070 --> 32:52.771
and Mein Kampf part two
is just a bunch of

32:52.871 --> 32:54.906
technical gobbledy-gook. I can't
make heads or tails of it.

32:55.007 --> 32:56.708
We need someone who
speaks the same language.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.744
Yeah. Hey, Deeks,
send it to Fatima.

32:58.844 --> 33:00.546
Have her show it
to the biohackers.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.681
That is a great idea.
Janice!

33:02.781 --> 33:05.017
(wind chimes chiming)

33:11.123 --> 33:12.091
Hi.

33:12.191 --> 33:17.029
So, I am a federal agent.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.399
I hate being right
all the time.

33:21.967 --> 33:24.436
Okay, this is pretty
straightforward.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.705
He's talking about eliminating
people with genetic defects.

33:26.805 --> 33:29.375
Or at least what he deems
to be genetic defects.

33:29.475 --> 33:30.809
We already know that.

33:30.909 --> 33:33.145
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you needed my help.

33:33.245 --> 33:35.013
If that's not the case,
I'll just go home.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.849
No, no, listen, sorry.
Yes, we do need your help.
Okay.

33:37.949 --> 33:40.086
Here's the deal.

33:40.186 --> 33:41.353
Embry is smart enough to know

33:41.453 --> 33:43.855
that CRISPR is extremely
difficult to use.

33:43.955 --> 33:45.957
Even the pros can't do
what he's referencing here.

33:46.058 --> 33:48.394
Then how did he
take down PFC Hanson?

33:48.494 --> 33:50.496
CRISPR isn't the weapon.

33:50.596 --> 33:53.132
The gene delivery vehicle is.

33:53.232 --> 33:54.233
The adenovirus.

33:54.333 --> 33:55.501
I thought
that was neutralized.

33:55.601 --> 33:56.902
True.
It can't give you a cold.

33:57.002 --> 33:58.670
But if it's altered
in just the right way,

33:58.770 --> 34:00.439
it can cause
a dangerous response

34:00.539 --> 34:01.740
from the immune system.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.542
That's what happened
to your Marine.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.644
But we still don't know
who he's targeting.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.113
Embry has Type 1 diabetes.

34:07.213 --> 34:08.880
'Cause he's written here
that he's never had

34:08.980 --> 34:11.550
a stable living situation
and he suffered a lot

34:11.650 --> 34:13.552
of medical complications
due to his condition.

34:13.652 --> 34:14.886
That's why
he joined the lab.

34:14.985 --> 34:16.388
A few years ago
he was having trouble

34:16.487 --> 34:17.822
affording the high cost
of insulin,

34:17.922 --> 34:19.558
so he rationed it to the point
where he almost died.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.059
Things got so bad

34:21.159 --> 34:23.027
he attempted suicide.

34:23.129 --> 34:24.295
Whoa.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.364
Embry deems himself a defect.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.065
And everyone like him.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.303
I think he's trying
to contaminate

34:31.402 --> 34:32.838
the insulin that they make here.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.342
Lisa's out making
deliveries right now.

34:36.442 --> 34:37.708
We have over 100 customers.

34:37.809 --> 34:40.411
Deeks, we need you to locate
the Open Source Bio

34:40.512 --> 34:42.148
delivery van now.

34:42.248 --> 34:44.350
DEEKS:
All right, you should be
seeing it straight ahead.

34:44.449 --> 34:46.083
There it is. And the bike.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.621
I'll cut 'em off.

34:52.791 --> 34:55.161
Federal agents!

34:55.261 --> 34:56.594
Out of the vehicle, now!

34:58.096 --> 35:01.032
Stay back!
You come any closer, she dies.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.000
Drop the knife.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.836
There's nowhere to go, Nicholas.

35:05.637 --> 35:07.706
Please don't.

35:08.774 --> 35:09.941
Please don't.

35:10.041 --> 35:12.178
I was never meant
to live anyway.

35:16.047 --> 35:17.082
We're broken.

35:17.183 --> 35:18.684
Come on, Nicholas.
That's not true.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.852
You're more than your disease,
you know that.

35:22.321 --> 35:24.423
"Life unworthy of life."

35:24.523 --> 35:25.924
SAM: Don't do it!
N-No!

35:28.794 --> 35:30.996
I'm going around.

35:34.266 --> 35:36.134
Stay down.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.604
Hands behind your back.

35:39.605 --> 35:42.140
What the...
Magnets, baby.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.020
(exhales sharply)

35:59.191 --> 36:01.159
God bless her.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.265
Ah!

36:07.933 --> 36:10.001
Admiral.

36:10.101 --> 36:12.338
Something I can
do for you?

36:12.438 --> 36:15.641
I heard your daughter is sick.
How is she?

36:17.343 --> 36:22.514
Um, she still has a fever,
but she's doing well.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.616
Thank you for asking.
I did not know

36:24.716 --> 36:27.653
the reason
for your lateness today.

36:27.753 --> 36:30.689
Agent Namazi
spoke up on your behalf.

36:30.789 --> 36:33.259
Yeah, well, she didn't...

36:33.359 --> 36:34.793
she didn't have to do that.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.862
No. And to be clear,

36:36.962 --> 36:40.165
this is not an apology
for what I said this morning.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.935
Regardless of
personal circumstances,

36:44.035 --> 36:47.906
I have to hold this office
to the highest of standards.

36:48.006 --> 36:51.843
Right. Yeah, no, it definitely
won't happen again, sir.

36:55.247 --> 36:57.249
Isn't easy.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.118
S-Sorry, what?

37:01.720 --> 37:03.922
It isn't easy

37:04.022 --> 37:06.758
balancing the work
that you do here

37:06.858 --> 37:09.060
with the, uh,

37:09.160 --> 37:11.730
equally important work
that you do at home.

37:11.830 --> 37:15.267
Speaking for myself,
I was never able

37:15.367 --> 37:16.968
to find that balance,

37:17.068 --> 37:20.138
and it is my life's regret.

37:30.282 --> 37:33.685
I have every confidence
that you will.

37:36.588 --> 37:39.458
Thank you, sir.

37:39.558 --> 37:43.862
I do not envy you.

37:52.504 --> 37:53.405
(door shuts)

37:53.505 --> 37:56.274
Want a beer?
Uh, sure.

37:56.375 --> 37:57.509
(phone chimes)

37:57.609 --> 37:59.645
Oh, just got a message
from the hospital.

37:59.745 --> 38:03.315
PFC Hanson has stabilized.

38:03.415 --> 38:06.352
Well...

38:06.452 --> 38:08.153
Here.

38:08.253 --> 38:09.855
Him and Embry
have something in common.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.690
Neither one of them
thought they were fit enough

38:11.790 --> 38:13.992
or good enough
to make something of themselves.

38:14.092 --> 38:15.827
Mm-hmm.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.531
Think I ought to get
magnets in my hands?

38:19.631 --> 38:21.132
Definitely.

38:21.232 --> 38:22.868
Hell, I'd even
consider it.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.003
The way she moved
that knife away from Embry.

38:25.103 --> 38:26.738
(chuckles)
That was sick.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.740
Uh, Sam...

38:28.840 --> 38:31.109
don't panic.

38:31.209 --> 38:32.844
What?

38:38.149 --> 38:40.452
G...

38:41.587 --> 38:44.523
Jake said that Houdini
was pretty good at escaping.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.958
The snake's name is Houdini?

38:48.827 --> 38:51.062
(boards creak)
Oh, hell no.

38:57.168 --> 39:00.672
I'm starting to see
why you don't like snakes.

39:00.772 --> 39:03.074
(door opens)

39:03.174 --> 39:04.342
Sam?

39:06.412 --> 39:08.914
(Houdini hisses)

39:09.014 --> 39:10.616
(boards creaking)

39:10.716 --> 39:12.984
(door opens)

39:14.753 --> 39:16.722
Mom? Mom!

39:16.822 --> 39:18.990
Shh! Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.926
What?
I just got her in bed.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.529
Her fever's broke,
but she's exhausted.

39:23.629 --> 39:25.296
Me too.

39:25.397 --> 39:27.433
It's amazing how
nine hours of television

39:27.533 --> 39:29.901
can take it out of you.

39:31.403 --> 39:33.472
You okay?
Yeah.

39:33.572 --> 39:35.140
I guess.

39:35.240 --> 39:38.444
What's going on?
Talk to me, Martin.

39:38.544 --> 39:41.947
I just feel like I was
torn in two all day long.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.415
I mean, Rosa gets sick and I

39:43.515 --> 39:45.016
don't want to leave
her, you know?

39:45.116 --> 39:46.718
'Cause she's already lost
so much in her life,

39:46.818 --> 39:48.019
I just wanted to stay and remain

39:48.119 --> 39:49.421
some sort of constant
in her life,

39:49.521 --> 39:50.922
but I can't do that
'cause I got a job,

39:51.022 --> 39:52.123
so I go to my job,
but then I'm late,

39:52.223 --> 39:54.292
Kilbride freaks out,
tears into me,

39:54.392 --> 39:56.562
punishes me with Ops,
which I am not built for,

39:56.662 --> 39:59.197
I can't make caldo de res,
I can't even spell it,

39:59.297 --> 40:02.834
I tried to google it.
My point is that today was...

40:02.934 --> 40:05.170
(sighs)
today was...

40:08.206 --> 40:10.275
I just wanted
to say thank you.

40:11.610 --> 40:14.179
Thank you for-for watching her

40:14.279 --> 40:16.982
and thank you for
taking care of her.

40:20.118 --> 40:23.555
And I'm really glad that
you live 43 seconds away.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.697
Thank you, Mama.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.932
You're welcome, honey.

40:36.468 --> 40:37.903
Ooh.
Ooh?

40:38.003 --> 40:40.506
You're burning up.
Yeah, I think you caught

40:40.606 --> 40:41.640
Rosa's flu.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.274
I did not. I'm just tired.

40:43.374 --> 40:45.644
Oh, God, Martin,
we're all tired.

40:45.744 --> 40:47.513
Come on, lay down.
I'm fine, Mom.

40:47.613 --> 40:49.047
Lay down. Pick 'em up.
Mom.

40:49.147 --> 40:50.982
Leave me... Mom.
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

40:51.082 --> 40:52.584
Come on, lay down, honey.
Are you kidding me?

40:52.684 --> 40:54.520
I'm not kidding anybody.
Lay down.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.522
Ah.
There we go.

40:56.622 --> 40:59.725
Now you just rest, okay?

40:59.825 --> 41:02.060
Mom'll bring you
the peanut butter.

41:06.064 --> 41:07.533
Is it crunchy?

41:07.633 --> 41:09.901
Of course it's crunchy.

41:10.001 --> 41:11.870
What do you take me for?

41:11.970 --> 41:14.172
(chuckles)

41:17.543 --> 41:19.277
I love you.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.588
ROBERTA: I love you, too.
