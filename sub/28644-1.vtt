<i>Now, I'm sure you've
heard of the amazing author</i>

00:15.549 --> 00:16.582
<i>Mitch Stockridge.</i>

00:16.584 --> 00:18.134
<i>So, how does he do it?</i>

00:18.135 --> 00:19.685
<i>How does he come up
with these original ideas,</i>

00:19.687 --> 00:21.053
<i>you guys are wondering.</i>

00:21.055 --> 00:23.088
<i>Some argue his books
have saved lives.</i>

00:23.090 --> 00:24.323
<i>So, join us next week</i>

00:24.325 --> 00:26.759
<i>for a documentary
on his amazing life.</i>

00:26.761 --> 00:28.227
<i>I'm a really big fan,</i>

00:28.228 --> 00:30.468
<i>so I'm gonna tell you now
you won't be disappointed.</i>

01:12.206 --> 01:14.206
<i>Success...</i>

01:15.209 --> 01:17.209
<i>it isn't what most
people think it is.</i>

01:18.312 --> 01:20.446
<i>It's a long and dark road</i>

01:21.248 --> 01:23.549
<i>and probably leave
many messes behind,</i>

01:23.551 --> 01:26.118
<i>and if you're not careful,</i>

01:26.120 --> 01:27.586
<i>you don't clean up
after yourself,</i>

01:27.588 --> 01:29.655
<i>those messes can come
back to haunt you.</i>

03:50.397 --> 03:51.897
Ms. Dettler, I'm John Logan.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.465
We spoke on the phone.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.668
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.303
No problem.

03:58.305 --> 03:59.838
Just ready to tell my story.

04:00.774 --> 04:01.773
Right.

04:01.775 --> 04:05.544
People need to know
who the real Mitch is.

04:12.820 --> 04:13.952
Proceed.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.524
Well, for six months

04:19.526 --> 04:22.394
I was in a relationship
with Mitch Stockridge.

04:23.297 --> 04:26.298
Wait, the... the author?

04:26.300 --> 04:28.317
Yes, the author.

04:28.318 --> 04:30.518
I keep a copy of <i> How to be
a Better Me</i> on my desk.

04:31.672 --> 04:34.273
Why? I'm a fan. I'm a big fan.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.474
I don't know how
the guy does it,

04:35.476 --> 04:38.310
comes up with all
these original ideas.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.379
If it wasn't for his
books on positivity,

04:40.381 --> 04:43.348
I wouldn't be the detective
I am today. Just saying.

04:43.350 --> 04:46.985
Mitch is a monster and a
brilliant liar at that.

04:48.622 --> 04:52.291
How? The guy helps
thousands of people.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.293
He's done things...

04:54.695 --> 04:56.762
terrible things to others,

04:57.898 --> 05:00.299
even terrible things to me.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.401
Alright, can you be
more specific?

05:02.403 --> 05:04.736
Look, I don't want
to be an accomplice

05:04.738 --> 05:07.739
or withhold valuable information
from the cops, you know.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.708
You said you were his ex, right?

05:11.312 --> 05:12.044
Yeah.

05:12.046 --> 05:14.446
Look, it's not for nothing.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.381
We get ex-girlfriends
in here all the time,

05:16.383 --> 05:18.143
say something like it
and back out.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.353
What are we talking
about here, huh?

05:21.355 --> 05:24.923
Domestic dispute? Abuse? What?

05:24.925 --> 05:26.358
It was abuse.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.461
Not the textbook kind though.

05:31.565 --> 05:34.933
Mitch was bullied
in school, I mean,

05:34.935 --> 05:36.501
he was bullied quite a bit.

05:37.371 --> 05:41.707
The worst was a childhood
bully named Luke Rousseau.

05:50.117 --> 05:54.419
¶¶¶

06:14.375 --> 06:15.707
From where do I know that name?

06:16.744 --> 06:18.477
Currently he's a missing person.

06:21.415 --> 06:22.415
And he told you this?

06:23.917 --> 06:24.950
You guys still talk?

06:26.553 --> 06:28.987
Well, we still talk
from time to time.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.425
He trusts me.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.696
But Mitch isn't the
most forgiving person.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.109
He holds grudges.

06:39.110 --> 06:40.521
But do you think
he would have...

06:40.522 --> 06:41.933
Okay, everything you
need to know about Mitch

06:41.935 --> 06:43.802
goes back to his childhood.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.704
And I know that sounds
like shrink talk

06:45.706 --> 06:47.005
but it's really all there.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.675
He was always
closer to his mother.

06:51.645 --> 06:52.944
<i>Talked about her a lot.</i>

06:56.517 --> 06:59.651
¶¶¶

07:13.867 --> 07:17.569
I got a mom, I get it.
It's a motherhood thing.

07:18.472 --> 07:19.671
Right.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.007
Go on, Sophie.

07:22.009 --> 07:25.677
His dying father lives
in that house with him,

07:25.679 --> 07:27.512
sealed away like some secret.

07:28.182 --> 07:30.015
I wasn't even allowed
to go into certain rooms

07:30.017 --> 07:31.082
on the second floor.

07:31.084 --> 07:35.120
The funny thing is Mitch
and his dad barely spoke.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.688
<i>He said it was his mom</i>

07:36.690 --> 07:38.857
<i>who always cheered on
his writing and stuff.</i>

07:39.793 --> 07:42.461
<i>His dad was the more "it's
not a real job" kind of guy.</i>

07:46.633 --> 07:47.966
It's garbage.

07:48.802 --> 07:53.205
Mitch and Carver
didn't really get along,

07:53.207 --> 07:54.840
and I know that's classic

07:54.842 --> 07:57.209
and you hear that from
half the scum you drag in,

07:57.211 --> 08:00.679
"It's not my fault. Daddy didn't
love me. Blah blah blah."

08:00.681 --> 08:02.013
<i>Yeah, but come on.</i>

08:02.015 --> 08:05.684
<i>I mean, Mitch prove
the old man wrong to me.</i>

08:05.686 --> 08:07.118
<i>He's been pretty successful.</i>

08:11.925 --> 08:14.960
I don't think success
changed Mitch.

08:14.962 --> 08:18.096
I think he's been who he is
for much longer than that.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.498
All right. Look, whatever.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.933
But is there anybody
this guy likes?

08:23.904 --> 08:24.904
Well...

08:27.908 --> 08:30.642
Okay, Mitch, you're
driving me crazy, man.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.177
It's late after work,
you dragged me out here

08:32.179 --> 08:34.011
'cause you have something
important to tell me

08:34.014 --> 08:35.780
and I should be at home
right now with Laura

08:35.782 --> 08:37.249
watching <i> Stranger Things.</i>

08:37.251 --> 08:38.984
- Final layouts due in a week.
- And?

08:38.986 --> 08:40.184
All I need is an ending.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.754
That's all you need, an ending.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.689
That's it. Well, that should
be so easy for you, Mitch.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.992
But the reason I have summoned
you my friend, Nick,

08:46.994 --> 08:49.227
is for something
much, much greater.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.230
Are you proposing to Sophie?

08:53.166 --> 08:55.267
You are, dude. I knew
it was gonna happen...

08:55.269 --> 08:57.302
Laura said, "He wants to be
single his whole life,

08:57.304 --> 08:58.720
he's a single guy."

08:58.721 --> 09:00.137
I said, "No, I know Mitch,
he's gonna settle down."

09:00.140 --> 09:02.173
And I knew it was coming.
I knew you were gonna do it.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.743
Actually, Sophie and I
are not a thing anymore.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.177
I feel like a giant asshole now.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.179
- That's because you are.
- Yeah.

09:08.181 --> 09:09.814
God.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.283
I'm sorry man. You okay?

09:11.285 --> 09:12.918
Yeah, I'm fine.
It ran its course.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.286
We still talk sometimes.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.557
Anyways, check this out.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.931
Luke Rousseau.
The Luke Rousseau wrote you?

09:25.933 --> 09:27.666
Can that guy even write?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.267
Who hand writes letters anyways?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.070
What does it say?

09:32.172 --> 09:34.139
- It's an apology.
- Well...

09:34.141 --> 09:36.141
- Better late than never, right?
- I guess.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.309
So you know about the letter?

09:37.311 --> 09:39.044
Wait, how do you know
about the letter?

09:39.046 --> 09:41.746
His family mentioned it
in the missing-persons report.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.882
- Do you have that letter?
- No.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.985
I'm just going to do with one
of the Cuban sandwiches.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.086
Sure.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.655
- <i>Pollo frito.</i>
- Excellent choice.

09:50.657 --> 09:52.657
Is this separate or together?

09:52.659 --> 09:53.625
- Together.
- Separate.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.126
- Mitch, don't...
- I got it.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.695
Stubborn.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.097
- Mitch Stockridge?
- In the flesh.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.131
I thought it was you.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.633
Oh, God, here we go.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.101
I love all your books.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.137
I read your <i> Life is Beautiful</i>
cover to cover twice

10:06.139 --> 10:07.339
the week that it came out.

10:07.341 --> 10:10.976
Just... really helped
with my depression.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.346
Oh, sorry, TMI.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.648
It's okay, I... it's very kind.
I like hearing those stories.

10:16.650 --> 10:17.849
Are you working on anything new?

10:17.851 --> 10:21.920
Oh, always.
I have a desk full of things,

10:21.922 --> 10:23.888
working on my newest collection

10:23.890 --> 10:26.625
and hoping to have my first
novel done soon as well.

10:26.627 --> 10:27.926
Wow!

10:27.928 --> 10:30.795
Well, I will have
to pick those up

10:30.797 --> 10:32.637
but I'll take care
of this for you, guys.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.487
<i>Whatever
happened to the dad?</i>

10:36.403 --> 10:38.837
He lives with him in his house.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.171
Mitch also works from home.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.086
Hey, dad, how are
you holding on?

10:56.723 --> 10:57.756
Yeah.

10:57.758 --> 10:58.758
That good, huh?

10:59.726 --> 11:00.726
What are you reading?

11:04.965 --> 11:07.065
You know that author and I
used to have the same agent.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.333
You know this guy?

11:10.103 --> 11:12.237
Well, that's a shame
I used to like him.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.107
We're not always on the
best sellers' list together

11:16.109 --> 11:17.242
but he's a great writer.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.260
- Luke, come on in.
- Hi, Mitch.

11:35.262 --> 11:36.995
<i>So Luke did come by.</i>

11:36.997 --> 11:38.797
<i>Yeah, Mitch told me.</i>

11:38.799 --> 11:41.066
Luke the childhood bully?

11:41.068 --> 11:43.968
Yes, John, try and keep up.
Don't interrupt.

11:44.871 --> 11:45.871
Were you there for this?

11:46.840 --> 11:48.306
No.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.308
There you go.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.110
<i>Can I get you anything?</i>

11:52.112 --> 11:54.279
Water, please.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.314
- H2O coming right up.
- Thank you.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.755
Make yourself at home.
<i>Mi casa su casa.</i>

12:03.757 --> 12:05.323
Okay, okay.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.927
- It's sweet place, man.
- Thank you.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.261
It's just you?

12:10.263 --> 12:11.830
It's me and dad.
I take care of him.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.498
He's a salty old fucker
but he's family, right?

12:13.500 --> 12:17.302
Yeah. For sure.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.042
I'm really surprised you called
me after that last letter.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.279
You know, I was such a prick.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.215
You know, I thought
you'd still be mad at me.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.884
Kids will be kids, right?

12:32.886 --> 12:34.919
Right. Right.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.790
- I appreciate that, Mitch.
- We all change.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.832
- I appreciate you reaching out.
- Yeah.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.362
Well, I read the last
bunch of your stories

12:44.364 --> 12:46.397
and it's interesting stuff, man.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.499
Any favorites?

12:48.301 --> 12:49.301
Yeah.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.003
The one about forgiveness.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.507
Chapter seven.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.210
It's literally calling
I forgive you Luke.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.313
And...

13:12.859 --> 13:15.393
Well, it's a great book, Mitch.

13:15.395 --> 13:18.863
Thank you. I like to write
about the human emotions

13:18.865 --> 13:21.833
and I think forgiveness is
a very important part of that.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.336
Yeah, yeah it is.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.973
Well, you did it, right?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.543
Look at you now. Famous writer.

13:31.545 --> 13:33.278
Not yet. Baby steps.

13:33.280 --> 13:36.481
Oh, you did it!
Stop being modest.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.184
And your mom would
be very proud of you.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.052
Thanks. I appreciate that.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.955
You never really feel
like "I did it though."

13:43.957 --> 13:45.557
It's never really done.

13:45.559 --> 13:47.926
What is doing it anyways, right?

13:47.928 --> 13:50.161
It's like there's always
the next one, and the next one

13:50.163 --> 13:52.564
and then somehow you
got to find the inspiration

13:52.566 --> 13:53.565
to do it all again.

13:53.567 --> 13:56.267
I feel like people
don't really understand

13:56.269 --> 13:59.137
the real sacrifice
for true success.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.441
Hey, beats working
in construction, right?

14:03.443 --> 14:04.909
Can I show you something?

14:07.180 --> 14:08.180
Yeah.

14:08.949 --> 14:09.949
Follow me.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.244
You are gonna love this.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.145
Yeah. The man cave?

14:41.147 --> 14:42.280
Something like that.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.449
Awesome.

14:49.623 --> 14:52.090
What in the fuck, man.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.259
- You helped me create it.
- What the fuck is that?

15:32.499 --> 15:33.998
Very inspirational, Luke.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.171
Can I interrupt now?

15:40.173 --> 15:41.472
Proceed, Detective.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.542
What kind of drugs are you on?

15:44.544 --> 15:46.678
I didn't believe it
at first either.

15:46.680 --> 15:47.612
Who would?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.280
Let me get this straight.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.250
- What exactly happened to Luke?
- I just told...

15:52.252 --> 15:54.085
You're accusing Mitch of...

15:54.087 --> 15:58.089
It gives him his stories,
all of his original ideas.

15:58.091 --> 16:01.109
What?

16:01.110 --> 16:04.128
Mitch feeds it people and
it gives him his story ideas.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.297
Okay, I think we're done here.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.565
Why don't we take a break?

16:07.567 --> 16:10.101
Good idea. Let's take a break.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.403
One more thing,
just hear me out.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.974
You should really consider
becoming an author.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.576
You... no, you're good,
you're really good.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.644
Just saying.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.656
Don't tell me you're
buying this crap.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.458
I'm not yet. I'm listening.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.627
We're not supposed
to support crazy.

16:36.629 --> 16:40.565
- Maybe she isn't crazy.
- What? Come on.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.117
Ignore the story.

16:42.118 --> 16:43.668
That's just something
her boyfriend is saying

16:43.670 --> 16:44.736
to mess with her head.

16:46.122 --> 16:47.505
Sounds like something
out of a book, right?

16:47.507 --> 16:49.440
Yeah, go back to the part
about ignoring the story.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.275
That part I can do,
not a problem.

16:51.277 --> 16:52.744
Look at the
facts, all right.

16:52.746 --> 16:55.513
This is our first lead
on Luke Rousseau.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.583
We have plenty of missing people
out there with no leads at all.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.519
- If Stockridge has motive here...
- Stockridge?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.221
You guys talking
about Mitch Stockridge?

17:03.223 --> 17:07.525
We got missing people, yeah.
Transient, sex workers.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.762
You think Stockridge is out
there feeding them to something?

17:10.763 --> 17:12.664
Of course, not.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.565
But if he thinks he is that's
enough to keep him going.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.567
You know these artistic types.
They're all a little...

17:16.569 --> 17:19.470
Yeah, I wouldn't kill somebody
to write a fucking book.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.339
Mitch is a rising star.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.807
Maybe he is a star.

17:22.808 --> 17:24.273
He could be famous
worldwide one day.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.643
That could be worth it to some.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.046
How? Why?

17:28.048 --> 17:31.416
Mitch writes inspirational
books, your self-help shit.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.969
Doesn't make sense
he's killing people.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.521
Just because his books help some
doesn't mean they help everyone.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.456
What does that even mean?

17:38.458 --> 17:39.424
Forget about it.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.426
Yeah.

17:42.729 --> 17:46.631
Look, I know you need this case,
especially after your last case.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.102
But please don't...
don't go overboard on this.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.205
I cannot believe you
just brought that up.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.640
Sorry.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.442
There's more to this, John.

17:57.444 --> 18:01.479
Yeah, scorned ex-lover blows
whistle on monster ex-boyfriend.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.847
How original?

18:02.849 --> 18:05.316
- I'm taking this on.
- Knock yourself out.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.287
Still love his books though.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.289
Me, too.

18:14.661 --> 18:15.661
Thank you.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.265
Where's Detective Logan?

18:21.267 --> 18:24.502
My counterpart and I don't
see eye to eye on this one.

18:24.504 --> 18:25.504
I noticed.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.273
I take it you were the good cop.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.275
Abby Dunn.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.579
I believe you.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.613
Really?

18:35.615 --> 18:36.781
Yes, actually.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.286
Good. He's beginning
to think I was going crazy.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.589
Sophie, being a cop in this area

18:44.591 --> 18:46.757
means I see a lot of rich
and powerful people

18:46.759 --> 18:48.519
get away with things
they shouldn't.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.595
That concerns me.

18:50.597 --> 18:54.799
Hearing someone out on a story
doesn't concern me at all.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.336
Thank you.

18:58.771 --> 19:02.874
So, how long has Mitch been
working and getting his ideas

19:02.876 --> 19:05.176
from this thing from the room?

19:06.212 --> 19:08.146
I have no idea.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.868
He's good at covering
his tracks.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.440
<i>How can he
do it all by himself?</i>

19:36.442 --> 19:37.602
<i>I really don't know.</i>

19:38.444 --> 19:40.411
<i>I know he has a driver
that's mute.</i>

19:40.413 --> 19:42.914
<i>That's the only person
that occasionally helps him.</i>

19:45.251 --> 19:48.286
Well, if you think of anything,
please let me know.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.188
I did the right thing, right?

19:50.190 --> 19:51.322
Absolutely.

20:04.938 --> 20:07.271
<i>Mitch Stockridge,
you might have heard of him,</i>

20:07.273 --> 20:08.639
<i>but this local celebrity</i>

20:08.641 --> 20:11.209
<i>has been releasing
life-changing self-help books</i>

20:11.211 --> 20:13.811
<i>and his latest release
is even more compelling.</i>

20:13.813 --> 20:16.347
<i>His original ideas
are captivating</i>

20:16.349 --> 20:18.249
<i>and even more so inspiring.</i>

20:18.251 --> 20:22.587
<i>I myself had a hard time
putting down his new book.</i>

20:22.589 --> 20:24.956
Of course, now to
bring out the topic

20:24.958 --> 20:28.693
of your newest collection
<i>All Is Forgiven.</i>

20:28.695 --> 20:30.628
Already flying off the shelves.

20:30.630 --> 20:34.365
I gotta say, Mitch,
this one is fantastic.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.969
Thank you. I'm trying, I guess.

20:37.971 --> 20:39.904
Well, tell us a little
about the book,

20:39.906 --> 20:42.607
you know, without giving
away the ending, of course.

20:43.876 --> 20:47.011
Well, this time it's a
series of connected stories

20:47.013 --> 20:49.880
dealing with redemption
and the lengths

20:49.882 --> 20:53.918
that our main characters
are willing to go to to get it

20:53.920 --> 20:56.454
with a few twists
and turns, of course.

20:56.456 --> 20:59.857
Well, we all know and love
the Stockridge voice.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.544
But over the years,

21:03.545 --> 21:06.429
your writing has gotten way
more creative and inventive.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.399
What's your secret?

21:09.469 --> 21:10.469
Who's your muse?

21:11.304 --> 21:12.370
No muse.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.473
Well, you're just on fire.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.609
The book is called
<i>All Is Forgiven</i>

21:18.611 --> 21:20.678
and you should buy
a copy right now.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.447
Mitch, thank you.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.906
Are you seeing this, Mitch?
The line is out the door.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.342
It's my hometown crowd,
what do you expect?

21:51.344 --> 21:53.978
Imagine what it'd be like
if we were in New York.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.513
You know I can't leave town.

21:55.515 --> 21:56.847
Oh, yeah, whatever, Mitch.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.382
As long as you keep up
the good work

21:58.384 --> 22:00.918
and, more importantly,
the sales, what do I care.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.753
And you thought I wouldn't
make the deadline.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.356
And you did
with three hours to spare.

22:05.358 --> 22:06.691
Don't let me stop you.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.326
- Look at that shirt.
- Yeah.

22:09.362 --> 22:12.063
- And who do I make that to?
- Yeah, Amelia, please.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.400
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

22:16.402 --> 22:19.070
If you don't mind,
I've got a quick question.

22:19.072 --> 22:21.356
Okay.

22:21.357 --> 22:23.641
I was wondering, where
do you get your ideas from?

22:23.643 --> 22:25.643
They're just so original!

22:25.645 --> 22:27.645
I get them from things
that happened to me,

22:27.647 --> 22:29.864
things in my life.

22:29.865 --> 22:32.082
Yeah, but is there a process?
Does someone help you?

22:32.085 --> 22:33.085
No.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.020
Then where?

22:36.956 --> 22:38.756
I don't steal them,
if that's what you're asking.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.558
- Can you get her mother...?
- Mitch.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.826
You're arguing
with a little girl.

22:41.828 --> 22:42.860
I'm fourteen.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.428
She's accusing me of plagiarism.

22:44.430 --> 22:46.030
What does that even mean?

22:46.032 --> 22:47.465
Have you lost your mind?

22:47.467 --> 22:48.799
Come on sweet, let's go.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.868
Good luck marrying her off.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.536
Asshole.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.605
- Am I the asshole?
- The line, Mitch.

22:55.575 --> 22:56.841
- Hi.
- Who do I make that to?

22:56.843 --> 22:58.042
- Bailey.
- Bailey.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.645
- Thank you.
- Next.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.116
Thank you.

23:17.830 --> 23:21.132
Pops, I just made soup.

23:22.802 --> 23:25.035
Hope you cook better
than your write.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.837
It's the joy of my day
to come up here

23:26.839 --> 23:28.839
and pump you full of soup

23:28.840 --> 23:30.840
after I've had a book
signing for a hundred fans.

23:30.843 --> 23:33.711
- Those keep me humble.
- A hundred fans, huh?

23:33.713 --> 23:35.913
Want to keep the
mortgage up on this pile.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.515
You even read the new one yet?

23:37.517 --> 23:39.717
- I flipped through.
- And?

23:39.719 --> 23:41.152
Come on Mitch,

23:41.154 --> 23:43.788
you've been writing the
same stupid self-help books

23:43.790 --> 23:45.423
over and over since
you were in college.

23:45.425 --> 23:46.791
Newsweek said the same thing.

23:46.793 --> 23:48.926
But I think they
meant it in a good way.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.861
What was your big plan
for me anyways growing up?

23:50.863 --> 23:51.996
Being a doctor?

23:51.998 --> 23:53.864
I'd still be paying off loans.

23:55.768 --> 23:58.769
Well, I would have been proud
of a son if he was a doctor.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.640
But I guess my dreams
will never come true.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.444
Anyway, it's good honest work.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.748
Sometimes people ask me
where I get my ideas from.

24:12.819 --> 24:15.019
I tell them from
forgiving my father.

24:15.021 --> 24:17.188
You're always a little bitch.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.928
Turns out you do cook
better than you write.

24:26.065 --> 24:27.998
It's still shit though.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.600
Yeah, you are what you eat.

24:37.844 --> 24:40.544
Who is the one little bitch now?

24:40.546 --> 24:42.112
Shut the fuck up.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.493
So congrats again
on the signing, man.

24:56.229 --> 24:58.128
Thanks. And you
weren't there why?

24:58.130 --> 25:00.831
Mitch, this is the third time
I'm telling you this,

25:00.833 --> 25:02.566
and I know you're
super butthurt about it,

25:02.568 --> 25:04.935
but the line to get
to you is a mile off.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.954
You're a mile tall,

25:06.955 --> 25:08.972
you could have pushed your way
to the front as my bodyguard.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.674
Yeah, as true
as that might be Mitch,

25:10.676 --> 25:12.743
there's no way
I'm getting through

25:12.744 --> 25:14.811
literally four hundred crazed
estrogen-fueled women

25:14.814 --> 25:15.913
trying to get to you.

25:17.917 --> 25:20.117
God, so how many
is this for you now?

25:20.119 --> 25:21.119
Women?

25:21.888 --> 25:23.053
Or you even kept count?

25:23.890 --> 25:25.556
No, books.

25:25.558 --> 25:27.118
- Too many to count.
- Yeah?

25:28.628 --> 25:31.529
- Did Luke end up showing up?
- Luke didn't come here.

25:32.265 --> 25:33.797
No, I didn't ask
if Luke came here.

25:33.799 --> 25:35.666
I mean, did he go
to the signing?

25:35.668 --> 25:38.903
Oh... Uh... I really didn't...

25:41.707 --> 25:42.740
He didn't show up.

25:43.843 --> 25:45.643
It's no big deal. I mean...

25:45.645 --> 25:47.678
I guess you could hand him
a copy of your book and say,

25:47.680 --> 25:50.648
"Luke, all is forgiven."

25:53.920 --> 25:55.837
It's a joke.

25:55.838 --> 25:57.755
Mitch, just give me something.
Courtesy laugh even.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.024
- Hearty ha ha.
- I'll take it. Jesus.

26:01.561 --> 26:02.960
Did you even read it?

26:02.962 --> 26:06.096
Yeah, of course, I read it.
It was nice. I liked it.

26:06.098 --> 26:07.598
It was "nice"?

26:07.600 --> 26:10.701
Yeah, man, I mean, you're
the English major here, okay?

26:10.703 --> 26:13.604
I'm an IT guy. I see
things in black and white.

26:13.606 --> 26:16.607
I liked the book. So, I don't
have a more colorful vocabulary.

26:16.609 --> 26:17.841
It's gonna have to be enough.

26:20.313 --> 26:21.579
Did you um...

26:23.849 --> 26:25.929
did you catch that piece
on you and the locals?

26:26.953 --> 26:28.819
I probably skimmed it.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.323
Yeah, it was super interesting.

26:32.325 --> 26:34.358
The... the reporter, she asked
you one of those, you know,

26:34.360 --> 26:36.660
"Where do you draw your
inspiration from" questions.

26:36.662 --> 26:39.229
You would know,
you were there, right?

26:39.231 --> 26:41.231
And if I remember correctly,

26:41.233 --> 26:44.368
you told her that you have
a never-ending supply

26:44.370 --> 26:47.972
of anger that you draw
from for your stories.

26:49.976 --> 26:50.675
Yeah.

26:50.676 --> 26:51.375
Okay, well, it's new news to me

26:51.377 --> 26:54.211
since I've known
you for forever.

26:54.213 --> 26:57.348
So, would you like to
elaborate a little more on it?

26:57.350 --> 26:58.350
It's like a...

26:59.986 --> 27:03.020
It's like a permanent
battery backup of anger.

27:04.357 --> 27:06.477
I write these books more
for myself than anything.

27:07.693 --> 27:09.760
Inadvertently it just
helps other people.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.998
Maybe one day I can
actually help myself.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.368
So, a permanent
battery backup of anger

27:17.370 --> 27:21.672
sounds way worse than
I thought to be honest.

27:22.408 --> 27:25.376
And I didn't want to
call you out on this,

27:25.378 --> 27:29.747
but do you think that's
the right choice to be taking?

27:29.749 --> 27:33.851
I mean, if you ever want to have
any peace or joy in your life?

27:34.820 --> 27:37.921
And this is why I make
more money than you make.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.826
Wow. Thanks, asshole.

27:45.665 --> 27:46.830
That's Laura. Hold on.

27:47.933 --> 27:50.167
Hey, hon.
Yeah, I'm over at Mitch's.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.986
No, it's fine.

27:51.987 --> 27:53.804
He just threatened me
with a butcher knife though.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.439
Yeah. No, I'm kidding,
we're good. We're good.

27:55.441 --> 27:58.776
Let him know he's a douchebag?
Yeah, I'll let him know.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.079
Okay. Yeah.
No, I'll be done soon, okay.

28:02.081 --> 28:04.161
And I'll head over there.
Just send me a list.

28:04.450 --> 28:07.685
Got it. Alright. Love you. Bye.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.539
Everything all right?

28:11.540 --> 28:13.724
Yeah. No, she just wants me to
make a Costco run on my way home

28:13.726 --> 28:15.459
because that's all marriage is,

28:15.461 --> 28:18.796
an endless supply
of Costco runs.

28:18.798 --> 28:21.765
- Sounds like fun.
- It's a fucking delight.

28:21.767 --> 28:23.233
And I wish you were married

28:23.235 --> 28:25.369
so you could know
just how much I enjoy it.

28:27.740 --> 28:31.041
You know, it's a pry
but whatever happened to Sophie?

28:36.882 --> 28:38.949
I tried to show her
who I really am,

28:40.119 --> 28:41.819
reveal myself to her,

28:42.855 --> 28:44.775
and I guess she just
wasn't ready for that.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.891
Well, Mitch, that's the
problem right there, buddy.

28:49.962 --> 28:52.062
You gotta stop revealing
yourself to women.

28:53.899 --> 28:56.934
Again, hearty ha ha. Laugh.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.368
- Don't you have to go?
- I do.

28:58.370 --> 29:01.004
Finish the avocados.
I'll see you soon.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.081
<i>Why don't you
ever stay the night?</i>

29:13.285 --> 29:16.253
I take care of my father.
You know that.

29:23.362 --> 29:26.497
You could put him
in a home or something

29:27.366 --> 29:29.466
or hiring home caring.

29:32.304 --> 29:35.305
I thought about it. But I got my
reasons for keeping him around.

29:37.510 --> 29:39.510
You're always so guarded.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.246
I guess.

29:42.248 --> 29:46.416
It's just weird I've
never even met him.

29:46.418 --> 29:48.519
That's because I like you.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.843
You're smaller?

30:15.114 --> 30:18.148
I'm trying to create something
big and you're getting smaller?

30:21.554 --> 30:23.053
What are you telling me?

30:26.959 --> 30:28.639
I don't know what
else to feed you.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.362
I'd kick your ass
if you even had one.

30:37.369 --> 30:38.468
No!

30:42.942 --> 30:46.210
Yeah.

30:46.212 --> 30:47.911
- <i>Hi, Mitch.</i>
- Natalie.

30:47.913 --> 30:50.347
How nice of you to call again.

30:50.349 --> 30:53.617
I'm just calling to congratulate
you on a great event.

30:53.619 --> 30:54.852
I'm sure.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.386
But while I have
you on the phone,

30:56.388 --> 30:58.188
is there any chance we could get

30:58.190 --> 31:01.491
a first few chapters
of the novel by the weekend?

31:03.295 --> 31:04.494
That wasn't the deal.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.263
I know, I know
it wasn't the deal,

31:06.265 --> 31:09.099
but I'd like to do things a bit
differently this time around,

31:09.101 --> 31:13.103
so we can avoid those instances
of being perpetually late.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.906
No need to beat around the bush.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.341
<i>I know, I'm just saying</i>

31:17.343 --> 31:19.943
that I don't want
to be late on this project.

31:19.945 --> 31:21.144
This is going to be the one

31:21.146 --> 31:24.181
that's gonna take you
way over the top.

31:24.183 --> 31:27.885
Yeah, I know, I want it to.

31:27.887 --> 31:29.487
Then we are on
the same page then?

31:30.256 --> 31:32.656
I'll see what I can
do over the weekend.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.224
<i>Great. That's good.</i>

31:55.047 --> 31:56.047
Fuck it.

32:01.987 --> 32:04.421
I know you get
this all the time.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.423
That's okay, go for it.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.659
Where do you get your ideas?

32:08.661 --> 32:12.562
Things happen to me and then
I exaggerate for effect.

32:14.166 --> 32:18.035
How many shitty people could you
possibly have left to forgive?

32:18.037 --> 32:21.238
Self-development is
a lifelong process.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.406
I guess.

32:22.408 --> 32:26.576
Don't worry, I don't have
anything against you... yet.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.180
You're funny.

32:30.182 --> 32:33.650
¶¶¶

32:40.192 --> 32:41.391
Mm.

32:44.430 --> 32:45.595
Let me look at you.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.699
Well?

32:48.701 --> 32:49.967
You're gorgeous, Mary.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.450
Uh...

33:06.452 --> 33:07.384
What you looking at?

33:07.386 --> 33:09.753
Sorry. I'm nosey.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.455
It's okay.

33:11.457 --> 33:12.457
You know...

33:14.059 --> 33:16.059
I thought I could be
a writer someday.

33:17.296 --> 33:18.595
Something special.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.331
I guess I just didn't
have the gift.

33:21.333 --> 33:24.201
Gift, curse, call it
wherever you like.

33:25.004 --> 33:27.571
- Don't be so dramatic.
- I know, I'm sorry.

33:29.575 --> 33:32.676
My latest book is
just missing something.

33:33.645 --> 33:36.046
It's like you never know
exactly what it takes.

33:36.048 --> 33:38.048
It takes a lot
out of you, doesn't it?

33:39.651 --> 33:42.285
Yeah. Nobody ever gets that.

33:49.495 --> 33:51.461
I don't like people
very close to me.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.431
This is why my last
relationship failed.

33:55.601 --> 33:59.136
This job requires
a certain type of isolation.

33:59.138 --> 34:02.639
Well, you must be
doing something right.

34:02.641 --> 34:05.075
Maybe. I have my regrets.

34:06.345 --> 34:07.345
Who doesn't?

34:09.782 --> 34:11.148
You wanna go upstairs?

34:14.119 --> 34:15.185
Yeah.

34:18.791 --> 34:22.292
¶¶¶

34:32.737 --> 34:35.338
- There's really a dog in there?
- Yeah.

34:45.650 --> 34:49.252
What is that?

34:53.125 --> 34:54.257
I'm sorry, Mary.

35:18.851 --> 35:20.717
This isn't a story,
these are notes.

35:20.719 --> 35:22.385
What you got, writer's
block or something?

35:24.623 --> 35:26.223
Not enough is right.

35:31.196 --> 35:33.630
Fuck you. I liked her.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.233
I kept up my end of the bargain.
You give me what she is worth.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.304
Make all the sound you want.
This is the last straw.

35:41.306 --> 35:42.539
I'll finish this book on my own

35:42.541 --> 35:44.301
like I should have
from the beginning.

36:20.345 --> 36:24.414
¶¶¶

36:43.602 --> 36:48.305
¶¶¶

36:48.307 --> 36:50.807
Hey, Sophie, it's me.

36:52.611 --> 36:55.612
Just wanted to talk.
I'm having kind of a bad night.

36:57.382 --> 36:59.916
<i>Anyways, call me back.</i>

37:01.420 --> 37:02.819
<i>Love you.</i>

37:02.821 --> 37:08.225
¶¶¶

37:20.505 --> 37:22.439
Mitch Stockridge?

37:22.441 --> 37:23.974
Nope. I think you're mistaken.

37:23.976 --> 37:26.876
You are not Mitch Stockridge,
bestselling author,

37:26.878 --> 37:29.512
whose picture hangs
in every local bookstore?

37:29.514 --> 37:32.182
Nope.

37:32.183 --> 37:34.851
Without that cheesy get-up,
you'll look just like him.

37:34.853 --> 37:37.254
- Well, I'm...
- Mr. Stockridge,

37:37.256 --> 37:39.289
I have a few questions
about Luke Rousseau.

37:40.792 --> 37:43.026
Alright. What do
you want to know?

37:43.028 --> 37:47.330
Well, I'm told he came to visit
you and then he never came home.

37:47.332 --> 37:48.431
That's not my problem.

37:49.635 --> 37:52.869
- You two had a history.
- You can say that.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.404
What, did he visit you?

37:54.406 --> 37:55.939
He did and then he left.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.041
What did you discuss?

37:58.043 --> 37:59.943
Nothing really. Just caught up.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.585
Hadn't seen him
since high-school.

38:02.314 --> 38:03.380
He liked the new book.

38:03.382 --> 38:07.450
Did he happen to mention where
he was headed after he left?

38:07.452 --> 38:09.052
Look, I'll save
you some digging.

38:10.289 --> 38:11.655
I never liked the guy much.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.791
And if you ask anybody
that knew us twenty years ago,

38:14.793 --> 38:16.426
they'll tell you the same thing.

38:16.428 --> 38:20.563
I wanted him gone... back then.

38:20.565 --> 38:23.433
We've moved on, all of us.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.969
And if that's all you have,
you wouldn't know how much.

38:25.971 --> 38:29.439
So, if you'll excuse me,
I am a little busy right now.

38:29.441 --> 38:30.991
Well, I understand that,

38:30.992 --> 38:32.542
but I still have a few
questions for you, Sir.

38:32.544 --> 38:34.978
What makes you think that I
even remember where he went?

38:34.980 --> 38:37.147
That was weeks ago.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.315
You never know.
They say writers are observant.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.820
I'm sorry I bothered you,
Mr. Stockridge.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.822
- Thank you for your time.
- You're welcome.

38:48.493 --> 38:51.761
If you hear anything else,
give me a call.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.863
Detective Abigail Dunn.

38:53.865 --> 38:54.931
I prefer Abby.

38:56.968 --> 39:00.603
My ex-husband used to read
your inspirational stories.

39:00.605 --> 39:02.439
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.874
- Happy to help.
- I didn't say they helped.

39:05.677 --> 39:08.778
All right.
Have a good one.

39:37.109 --> 39:38.408
Hello, Natalie.

39:38.410 --> 39:39.776
<i>Yeah, I saw the covers.</i>

39:39.778 --> 39:41.144
We haven't said anything.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.746
Be a lot easier
to get through things

39:42.748 --> 39:44.381
if I stopped
getting interrupted.

39:44.383 --> 39:46.649
I'm gonna pretend you're
referring to other people.

39:46.651 --> 39:49.552
Well, I could choose
a cover if I had a book.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.888
And it's kind of hard for us
to come up with a cover

39:51.890 --> 39:53.890
when we haven't got a book yet.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.959
Can we just slow things
down a little bit right now?

39:55.961 --> 39:57.660
I'm kind of going
through something here.

39:57.662 --> 40:00.430
Oh, Mitch,
you made a commitment.

40:00.432 --> 40:02.632
<i>You're gonna have
to live with it.</i>

40:11.643 --> 40:13.576
Yeah, go fuck yourself.

40:20.018 --> 40:24.154
I didn't peg you to be a reader
of self-help books, Detective.

40:26.158 --> 40:28.525
I tried to see what it would
give me on Luke Rousseau.

40:28.527 --> 40:30.761
It wasn't much.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.996
- Well, maybe Logan was right.
- Maybe.

40:32.998 --> 40:36.533
Well, in any event, I hope
you like missing person cases

40:36.535 --> 40:38.468
- because I've got another one.
- Let me guess.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.503
Another drunk college kid
on daddy's boat.

40:40.505 --> 40:41.871
You wish.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.941
This one is a sad story.
A woman named Mary.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.776
Christ.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.912
- Any leads?
- Nothing so far.

40:48.914 --> 40:51.114
I guess there's no
justice in this world.

40:51.116 --> 40:54.117
If you find any, make sure
the front desk knows.

40:59.724 --> 41:01.191
Okay.

41:01.193 --> 41:02.926
I propose a toast right now

41:02.928 --> 41:04.861
to the best first draft

41:04.863 --> 41:08.965
of the best novel
since Jane Eyre.

41:10.202 --> 41:12.001
Please don't laugh.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.637
- Don't. It's insulting.
- Jane Eyre?

41:14.639 --> 41:16.973
It's literally the only novel
I can think of at the time.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.775
Did you google books
just to drop that one?

41:18.777 --> 41:21.010
Okay, I like Jane Eyre,
I have a feminine side.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.880
What? Stop.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.215
Cheers, Nick.

41:25.217 --> 41:27.617
Now I know why are you
over here all the damn time.

41:27.619 --> 41:30.487
I haven't toked like this
since grad school.

41:30.489 --> 41:31.788
- Did she say toked?
- Mm-Hm.

41:31.790 --> 41:33.523
Is that the word
she just used, "toked"?

41:33.525 --> 41:35.091
I've never heard my wife
use that word before.

41:35.093 --> 41:37.160
- My classy, classy wife.
- Hey.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.095
I'm allowed to have
a masculine side.

41:39.097 --> 41:40.129
Yes, you are.

41:40.131 --> 41:42.599
Mm. I'm out.

41:42.601 --> 41:43.967
Let me get you another
one real quick.

41:43.969 --> 41:45.702
Fresh out.
I'm gonna go make a run.

41:45.704 --> 41:47.170
Not like this, you're not.

41:47.172 --> 41:48.805
It's a few beers. I'm fine.

41:48.807 --> 41:50.039
Mitch, don't.

41:50.041 --> 41:51.508
You two have fun.

41:52.911 --> 41:54.711
Drive safe, buddy.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.750
He can't just go on like this.

42:01.786 --> 42:03.586
There's nothing
I can do for him. I know.

42:03.588 --> 42:05.054
It's not your job.

42:05.056 --> 42:06.256
You can't just
take care of him...

42:06.258 --> 42:07.991
I know. Listen, okay?

42:07.993 --> 42:09.926
You are not there when
the crowds are there

42:09.928 --> 42:12.128
and the parties, everybody is
gushing over the guy, okay?

42:12.130 --> 42:13.263
I'm there in the alone time

42:13.265 --> 42:16.299
and I see how he is
and how he acts.

42:16.301 --> 42:18.001
While I'm
sitting home alone?

42:18.003 --> 42:19.536
You don't have
to sit home alone.

42:19.538 --> 42:21.037
You go out have
girl time if you want.

42:21.039 --> 42:24.007
- Okay, thank you very much.
- Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:24.009 --> 42:26.109
Okay, listen, right?

42:26.111 --> 42:27.243
Mitch is my best friend.

42:27.245 --> 42:30.280
He is just going through
a rough period right now, okay?

42:30.282 --> 42:31.548
That's it.

42:33.552 --> 42:35.084
He brings it on himself.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.887
He is never happy.

42:39.991 --> 42:41.157
Yeah, I know he is not.

42:57.242 --> 42:59.576
Small world. Hi there.

43:01.746 --> 43:03.813
You followed me
to the store, really?

43:05.684 --> 43:07.917
I'm not here on business,
Mr. Stockridge.

43:07.919 --> 43:10.186
Contrary to what you
may have seen on TV,

43:10.188 --> 43:13.122
cops do not subsist
exclusively on donuts.

43:13.124 --> 43:15.625
Are you denying that you
like donuts, Detective?

43:15.627 --> 43:17.961
Don't be ridiculous.
They are delicious.

43:17.963 --> 43:20.330
- Excuse me, Mr. Stockridge.
- Oh, hi.

43:20.332 --> 43:22.899
Hi. I can't believe it.

43:22.901 --> 43:25.068
- I'm your biggest fan. Do you...
- Yes.

43:25.070 --> 43:27.670
- Do you think you could?
- Yes, of course.

43:32.744 --> 43:33.876
Thank you so much.

43:33.878 --> 43:35.094
You're welcome.

43:35.095 --> 43:36.695
Your book saved
my friend's life.

43:40.719 --> 43:42.051
Wow.

43:42.053 --> 43:45.288
You saved a life.
Not many authors can say that.

43:45.290 --> 43:46.356
What do you want?

43:46.358 --> 43:48.691
Nothing. I promise.

43:48.693 --> 43:53.029
Although, since we are
both here shopping for juice,

43:53.031 --> 43:56.032
I will confess I do have
a few more questions.

43:56.034 --> 43:58.034
Doesn't mean I'm gonna
have any more answers.

43:58.036 --> 44:00.770
- Not about Luke Rousseau.
- Oh.

44:00.772 --> 44:02.205
You were recently
seen having drinks

44:02.207 --> 44:03.973
with a woman named Mary Rollins.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.908
I can provide you with
the date, time and location

44:05.910 --> 44:07.210
if that would refresh
your memory.

44:07.212 --> 44:09.812
I remember. Nice girl.

44:09.814 --> 44:14.083
Well, it was bar, so eyewitness
memories are predictively fuzzy.

44:14.085 --> 44:15.885
No one can be sure
they saw her leave.

44:15.887 --> 44:18.221
- I was wondering if you did.
- Can't help you.

44:18.223 --> 44:20.090
So, we done here?

44:20.091 --> 44:21.958
Another person is missing,
Mr. Stockridge.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.693
Most people might express

44:23.695 --> 44:25.995
little more interest
in the situation you're at.

44:25.997 --> 44:26.997
Leave me alone.

44:29.167 --> 44:30.199
Suit yourself.

44:31.336 --> 44:33.136
Enjoy your day.

44:35.206 --> 44:37.523
Oh, Detective,

44:37.524 --> 44:39.841
I just remembered donuts
are on aisle nine, FYI.

44:54.159 --> 44:55.191
Got a treat for you.

44:57.328 --> 44:59.028
That's just poison.

44:59.030 --> 45:00.270
What are you, a health nut now?

45:01.433 --> 45:02.832
What you got to live
for anyways?

45:02.834 --> 45:04.100
Who are those people downstairs?

45:04.102 --> 45:06.069
It's Nick and Laura.

45:06.071 --> 45:08.705
You still hanging
around that Nick kid?

45:08.707 --> 45:10.273
Damn!

45:10.275 --> 45:13.042
- She's still eight feet tall?
- It's actually worse, dad.

45:13.044 --> 45:15.044
I'm still hanging around you.

45:15.046 --> 45:16.412
You love to complain.

45:17.482 --> 45:20.383
I was half as bad
as you say I am.

45:20.385 --> 45:23.019
You put a pillow
over my face long ago.

45:23.021 --> 45:24.454
I would never do that, dad.

45:24.456 --> 45:26.723
These pillows are
way too expensive.

45:26.725 --> 45:30.126
- Oh, my son!
- That's debatable.

45:52.283 --> 45:53.449
Working on it!

46:07.499 --> 46:08.898
Hi.

46:08.900 --> 46:10.433
Jab cross.

46:10.435 --> 46:12.769
Put some power on it. Jab cross!

46:13.838 --> 46:15.304
I want some power. One, two.

46:16.174 --> 46:17.807
Think of someone
you hate. One, two.

46:19.511 --> 46:20.810
Think of someone you hate!

46:20.812 --> 46:22.278
Come on!

46:22.280 --> 46:24.547
I said someone
you hate. One, two.

46:24.549 --> 46:27.049
Come on. Come on!

46:27.852 --> 46:29.852
I said someone you hate!

46:29.854 --> 46:32.088
One, two!

46:32.090 --> 46:34.857
Come on! Come on!

49:58.162 --> 50:00.229
I am proud.

<i>I just hope you are hard
at work on the next one.</i>

50:02.300 --> 50:05.001
Yeah, I just got pages
flowing out of me.

50:06.304 --> 50:07.770
Any updates, Detective?

50:07.772 --> 50:09.305
None so far, Sir.

50:09.307 --> 50:11.240
I have been keeping
a close eye on him,

50:11.242 --> 50:14.143
but I've got about as close
as I can get without a warrant.

50:14.145 --> 50:16.545
No, remember, we want
to keep this quiet.

50:16.547 --> 50:17.780
He's kind of a big shot in town.

50:17.782 --> 50:19.615
Big shots are my specialty, Sir.

50:19.617 --> 50:22.418
Detective,
we do not want a repeat

50:22.420 --> 50:24.186
of your last investigation.

50:24.188 --> 50:25.688
There won't be, Sir.

50:25.690 --> 50:26.690
Good.

50:27.625 --> 50:30.359
Just play it cool
with Stockridge.

50:30.361 --> 50:32.762
- No more gut feelings.
- Understood.

50:50.148 --> 50:52.181
Yeah, gotcha.

51:08.299 --> 51:09.565
Yeah, I know.

51:13.404 --> 51:14.737
I'm just disappointed.

51:15.640 --> 51:17.306
You can do better than that.

51:17.308 --> 51:20.576
Fuck you, grand old
dork motherfucker.

51:21.446 --> 51:22.611
Piece of shit!

51:31.089 --> 51:32.354
You seem tense.

51:33.191 --> 51:34.457
I hope you're happy

51:34.459 --> 51:37.493
because they're saying what
you've been saying all along.

51:38.296 --> 51:40.229
I'll have to take
your word for it.

51:41.265 --> 51:43.165
I don't get them much.

51:43.167 --> 51:44.767
I tried to do
something different,

51:44.769 --> 51:46.769
something new,
something from here.

51:50.173 --> 51:51.739
But in the end, it was
the same old trick.

51:51.742 --> 51:54.210
What are you telling me for?

51:54.212 --> 51:56.278
Because I don't have
mom to talk to anymore.

51:57.482 --> 51:59.115
She would have made you soft.

52:14.132 --> 52:16.632
I guess I'm just more
of a short story guy, huh?

52:16.634 --> 52:18.200
Aren't you on top of this?

52:18.202 --> 52:20.369
We publicized all we could.

52:21.739 --> 52:24.540
I guess one week here on top,
next week it's a ghost town.

52:27.745 --> 52:28.778
I just don't understand.

52:28.779 --> 52:29.812
- The book's out and...
- And?

52:29.814 --> 52:31.914
Well, you read the reviews.

52:31.916 --> 52:33.716
I just don't get it.
This book has everything.

52:33.718 --> 52:36.485
I know, your blood,
your sweat, your tears.

52:36.487 --> 52:38.888
Is this the
Terrance Williams signing?

52:38.890 --> 52:40.623
No, he was here yesterday.

52:40.625 --> 52:42.558
Oh. Sorry.

52:42.560 --> 52:44.793
- Fucking Terrance.
- Oh, come on, Mitch.

52:44.795 --> 52:47.196
You know the reading
public's fickle.

52:47.198 --> 52:49.565
Maybe they just needed something
different this time around.

52:49.567 --> 52:52.268
- Thanks for your input.
- I'm just trying to be helpful.

52:52.937 --> 52:55.471
Oh, great, hope that
makes you feel better.

53:00.378 --> 53:01.461
<i>Voilá.</i>

53:01.462 --> 53:02.545
It's better be
as good as you say.

53:02.547 --> 53:04.387
You've been rolling it
for half hour.

53:16.527 --> 53:17.527
I love you.

53:24.735 --> 53:27.970
I just don't know what happened.
There was like nobody there.

53:27.972 --> 53:29.538
Well, I'll be honest.

53:30.341 --> 53:31.607
You finished it last night.

53:34.312 --> 53:35.312
Yeah?

53:37.782 --> 53:39.715
I'm your friend, I'm gonna
give it to you straight.

53:39.717 --> 53:40.717
I know.

53:42.620 --> 53:45.221
Something is different
about you, man.

53:45.223 --> 53:47.456
Something's changed.
I don't know what it is.

53:48.426 --> 53:50.392
And maybe you need to stay
with the small stuff.

53:50.394 --> 53:52.034
No one is gonna
fault you for that.

53:52.563 --> 53:54.413
Some people will.

53:54.414 --> 53:56.414
Come on, Mitch, who's
gonna fault you for that?

53:58.369 --> 54:00.402
Nick, what motivates you
to get up in the morning,

54:00.404 --> 54:01.604
go to the office and all that?

54:04.508 --> 54:06.108
If I didn't,
I wouldn't have a job.

54:09.013 --> 54:10.613
I don't know what
you want me to say, man.

54:10.615 --> 54:11.914
I mean, I'm living it up here.

54:11.916 --> 54:13.749
You know, I got a
great middle-class life.

54:13.751 --> 54:17.553
I have a wife who's
way too hot for me.

54:17.555 --> 54:19.755
It's more than we could've
ever dreamed of as kids.

54:20.992 --> 54:23.726
All we had as kids it's Luke
Rousseau beating our faces in

54:23.728 --> 54:25.995
every day for our lunch money.

54:25.997 --> 54:29.565
And if you lost your job,
your career went belly-up,

54:29.567 --> 54:31.734
how would Laura react?

54:32.870 --> 54:35.004
Laura would be
extremely disappointed.

54:35.006 --> 54:36.372
She'd be pissed off for a while.

54:37.608 --> 54:39.808
But Laura doesn't depend
on material things

54:39.810 --> 54:41.410
to make her happy.

54:41.412 --> 54:42.945
Let's say you did
a really good job at work,

54:42.947 --> 54:45.648
and you got a promotion
and a bonus

54:46.484 --> 54:48.784
or whatever, and you were
able to buy a bigger house.

54:50.021 --> 54:51.754
Then, not to say it's bad now,

54:51.756 --> 54:53.716
but your relationship
would be better, right?

54:55.293 --> 54:56.592
Can be worse.
I'll give you that.

54:56.594 --> 54:58.434
Okay, then you see
where I'm coming from.

55:01.365 --> 55:02.898
Here comes the airplane.

55:06.704 --> 55:08.737
Look who's in a good mood.

55:09.607 --> 55:11.907
Yeah, I am.

55:11.909 --> 55:13.409
I finally figured something out.

55:18.783 --> 55:19.915
From now on,

55:20.985 --> 55:23.018
you're gonna like
me for who I am

55:23.854 --> 55:27.022
or you can just
go fuck yourself.

55:28.659 --> 55:29.758
What about you?

55:31.629 --> 55:33.762
Do you like yourself?

55:33.764 --> 55:34.930
I'm gonna give it a try.

55:36.734 --> 55:39.068
You hate yourself, Mitch.

- Yeah, sorry.

57:49.099 --> 57:50.566
I get down here from New York

57:50.568 --> 57:52.701
and you can't
make it six blocks?

57:52.703 --> 57:54.136
I'm busy, come on.

57:54.138 --> 57:57.072
I can't be the first writer
to be behind on a deadline.

57:57.074 --> 57:58.874
Yeah, well, about that.

57:58.876 --> 58:00.042
What?

58:01.145 --> 58:02.878
You got a contract
for two books.

58:02.880 --> 58:04.880
We haven't seen
the second book yet.

58:04.882 --> 58:06.215
The first one wasn't that great,

58:06.217 --> 58:07.716
so what's the rush
for the next one?

58:07.718 --> 58:09.918
You've had enough extensions.

58:09.920 --> 58:13.155
Yeah, we need the manuscript
and we need it in a week.

58:13.157 --> 58:14.089
A week?

58:14.091 --> 58:17.226
That's impossible.
That's not gonna happen.

58:17.228 --> 58:20.529
Well, then we're gonna sue
you for breach of contract.

58:20.531 --> 58:21.497
What?

58:21.499 --> 58:25.267
Look, your last book
didn't work out, now did it?

58:25.269 --> 58:27.236
We need something
new from you

58:27.238 --> 58:29.905
to fill the shelves
and cover up, a stanch.

58:29.907 --> 58:33.275
And we are less likely
to play nice with you Mitch

58:33.277 --> 58:35.811
after the last debacle.

58:35.813 --> 58:36.879
I'm being serious.

58:37.681 --> 58:39.181
I made your reputation.

58:39.183 --> 58:41.550
Yeah, and we made yours.

58:41.551 --> 58:43.918
And you know, if you
could just get things to us

58:43.921 --> 58:47.256
in plenty of time so we could
edit it to our satisfaction

58:47.258 --> 58:49.825
instead of a usual trick
of bringing us things

58:49.827 --> 58:52.594
three minutes
before the deadline.

58:52.596 --> 58:56.698
Honestly, Mitch, you artistic
types, you all are the same!

58:57.701 --> 59:01.570
Plenty of ideas,
nothing to show for it.

59:01.572 --> 59:03.171
Now, what are we in
the hole for here anyways?

59:03.173 --> 59:05.040
We're selling paper

59:05.041 --> 59:07.081
and most of the business
is in e-books anyway.

59:07.778 --> 59:09.912
So, the last one
didn't go that well.

59:09.914 --> 59:11.464
We'll make it up.

59:11.465 --> 59:13.015
- Not good enough.
- I'll give you good enough.

59:13.017 --> 59:15.250
Yeah, well just give me
good enough in seven days.

59:31.302 --> 59:34.069
All right.
I'm gonna take you upstairs.

59:34.071 --> 59:36.805
Okay. What's upstairs?

59:36.807 --> 59:38.106
A surprise.

59:38.108 --> 59:40.042
- Should I close my eyes?
- No.

59:41.178 --> 59:43.946
I want to open your eyes for the
first time in our relationship.

59:43.948 --> 59:46.715
Right, there's that mysterious
writer talk again.

59:46.717 --> 59:49.217
No. No mysteries.

59:53.223 --> 59:54.256
Sophie...

59:56.760 --> 59:57.760
I love you.

59:59.129 --> 01:00:01.063
I haven't said that
to a lot of women.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:04.633
I want to be honest
with you about everything

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:07.870
Come on.

01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:13.342
Shhh, shhh.

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:15.278
Listen.

01:00:18.048 --> 01:00:19.348
I don't hear anything.

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:22.250
It's being quiet.

01:00:22.252 --> 01:00:24.920
I've been keeping it in check
since you've been coming over.

01:00:24.922 --> 01:00:27.222
What are you hiding in there?

01:00:28.025 --> 01:00:29.025
Really?

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:30.792
The truth.

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:33.695
Something I've never
shown anyone before.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.365
Well, let's get this over with.

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:38.934
I'm gonna close your eyes now.

01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:43.271
Okay.

01:00:48.879 --> 01:00:51.313
Surprise, it's me.

01:00:55.753 --> 01:00:56.785
What?

01:00:58.022 --> 01:01:00.756
That's how I get
my ideas for my stories.

01:01:00.758 --> 01:01:03.892
I defeated people
but it's how it works.

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:05.794
I... I don't understand.

01:01:05.796 --> 01:01:07.896
It just showed up one night.
I don't know.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:14.136
Sophie, I do this for us.

01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:15.404
I can't... I can't do this.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.673
We let you in.

01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:21.109
Sophie!

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:35.757
¶¶¶

01:02:01.018 --> 01:02:02.018
Hi.

01:02:03.087 --> 01:02:04.687
Hi yourself.

01:02:04.688 --> 01:02:07.128
It's the part where you ask me
if I want to have a good time?

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:10.792
Hard to get it like it.

01:02:12.096 --> 01:02:13.228
How much?

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.930
All depends on
how much you want.

01:02:14.932 --> 01:02:16.064
Fair enough.

01:02:17.868 --> 01:02:19.034
I've got money, don't worry.

01:02:19.036 --> 01:02:20.302
Who is worried?

01:02:30.881 --> 01:02:31.847
Come on.

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:38.954
You are under arrest for
solicitation of a prostitute.

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:40.422
This is entrapment.

01:02:40.424 --> 01:02:41.890
You asked me, big boy.

01:02:41.892 --> 01:02:43.825
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:46.762
Anything you say maybe held
against you in the court of law.

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:48.029
Wonderful.

01:02:49.967 --> 01:02:51.466
I love your books.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:54.169
Thanks. You want me to go now?

01:03:07.084 --> 01:03:11.887
¶¶¶

01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:13.388
Is he still here?

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.891
- Made bail last night.
- Figures.

01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:18.260
I have been trying to get
warrant on this guy since...

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:20.929
This may be my chance.

01:03:22.032 --> 01:03:23.749
With this in his file,

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:25.467
someone up the chain may see
that he's not so perfect

01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:27.836
and back me up on this.

01:03:27.838 --> 01:03:28.970
Thank you.

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:42.818
Thanks for bailing me out, man.

01:03:43.821 --> 01:03:45.461
Do we need to go
get your car now?

01:03:46.123 --> 01:03:47.422
I'll take care
of it in the morning.

01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:51.593
God, Mitch, this Sophie thing
must have you really fucked up

01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:53.128
if you're picking up hookers.

01:03:56.099 --> 01:03:59.868
I was gonna kill her
and hope nobody would notice.

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:01.970
It's good. You should keep
that charming sense of humor,

01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:03.305
it's getting you far.

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:05.941
I'm fucking drained.

01:04:05.943 --> 01:04:08.977
You know, I wasn't gonna say
anything but you look like shit.

01:04:08.979 --> 01:04:10.078
I was in jail.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.246
I know.

01:04:11.248 --> 01:04:13.481
And I hope you've
made a lot of friends,

01:04:13.483 --> 01:04:16.518
friends you can confide in,
talk to, you know.

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:19.421
I feel like shit.

01:04:20.991 --> 01:04:23.024
I've been in a bad
place for a while, Nick.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:24.960
That's generally the reason

01:04:24.962 --> 01:04:27.362
people pick up hookers
in the first place.

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:28.463
No, it's not that.

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:34.302
I think I know what
I need to do now

01:04:35.505 --> 01:04:37.265
and a hooker wasn't
gonna be enough.

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:41.443
I got some rainy day
money upstairs...

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:44.045
to get you paid.

01:04:45.115 --> 01:04:46.214
Come with me.

01:04:58.528 --> 01:05:00.028
All right. So, I
kind of understand

01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:02.197
why you don't want people
snooping around up here.

01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:05.567
Well, I think after all
these years my secret is safe.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:08.236
I can't believe
I'm even up here.

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:10.505
You've kept this whole
upstairs from me for so long.

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:14.590
I almost don't want
to show you.

01:05:16.179 --> 01:05:17.179
Show me what?

01:05:18.649 --> 01:05:19.649
Me.

01:05:32.362 --> 01:05:33.628
I know, right?

01:05:36.466 --> 01:05:37.565
What is that?

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:41.149
I'm trying to figure out
for years, believe me.

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:45.674
Is it real?

01:05:45.676 --> 01:05:47.676
Yeah.

01:05:52.249 --> 01:05:53.715
Okay.

01:05:53.717 --> 01:05:55.517
All right. Uh...

01:05:57.554 --> 01:05:59.020
Thank you for showing me.

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:04.192
I... You know, I won't say
anything to anyone about this.

01:06:05.228 --> 01:06:07.228
No, Nick, I know.

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:08.296
No, Mitch!

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:09.331

Hello?

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:41.749
Who is there?

01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:42.751
Luke?

01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:44.652
Hello?

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:52.127
Mitch, is that you?

01:09:00.337 --> 01:09:02.770
Shit!

01:09:02.772 --> 01:09:04.139
What's that?

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:08.443
Okay, okay.

01:09:42.312 --> 01:09:45.813
¶¶¶

01:09:53.223 --> 01:09:55.490
Well, author Mitch Stockridge's
second novel

01:09:55.492 --> 01:09:57.559
is raking in the rave reviews.

01:09:57.561 --> 01:10:00.662
New York Times calls it
ambitious and brilliant.

01:10:00.664 --> 01:10:03.731
The Chicago Tribune
says it's a bold new step

01:10:03.733 --> 01:10:05.200
in truly self-help.

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:07.235
<i>And the San Francisco
Chronicle says</i>

01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:09.571
<i>it's not only the most
inspirational book</i>

01:10:09.573 --> 01:10:10.638
<i>of the decade,</i>

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.374
<i>it just might be the strongest.</i>

01:10:29.593 --> 01:10:31.326
I knew you could do it, Mitch.

01:10:31.962 --> 01:10:33.779
You're a genius.

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:35.597
No such thing. It's a lot
of hard work and sacrifice.

01:10:35.599 --> 01:10:36.864
Matthew Lopez.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:44.005
Next please.

01:10:44.007 --> 01:10:46.608
To Peter Sanchez.

01:10:49.779 --> 01:10:51.479
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:11:06.997 --> 01:11:07.997
Mitch.

01:11:09.733 --> 01:11:11.266
Hey, Laura.

01:11:11.268 --> 01:11:13.568
I see you've got
another book out.

01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:15.536
Congratulations.

01:11:15.538 --> 01:11:18.039
- I'm sure Nick is very proud.
- Thanks. That means a lot.

01:11:18.041 --> 01:11:20.008
Have you heard
anything from Nick?

01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:21.693
No.

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:23.377
You're his best friend.
He didn't tell you anything?

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:24.545
I'm sorry.

01:11:24.547 --> 01:11:25.780
Please try to...

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:27.949
I have to go, Laura.

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:40.495
You're walking
the beat, Detective?

01:11:40.497 --> 01:11:43.564
Kind of. I was over at
Mitch Stockridge's place.

01:11:43.566 --> 01:11:46.367
Oh, funny story.
You got your warrant.

01:11:47.837 --> 01:11:49.671
Are you kidding me?

01:11:49.673 --> 01:11:52.307
I thought they were gonna
protect this guy forever.

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:54.742
What did it?

01:11:54.744 --> 01:11:56.744
- The hooker thing?
- Yes.

01:11:56.746 --> 01:12:00.415
Well, it turns out the guy that
bailed your boy out is missing.

01:12:02.385 --> 01:12:04.686
What is it with you
and this author?

01:12:04.688 --> 01:12:05.753
I have to go.

01:12:13.863 --> 01:12:17.065
Look at this,
"ambitious and brilliant."

01:12:18.635 --> 01:12:20.501
It's the New York Times talking.

01:12:21.738 --> 01:12:22.904
You read The Chronicle yet?

01:12:24.107 --> 01:12:25.540
I got through some of them.

01:12:26.576 --> 01:12:27.842
Takes me a while these days.

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:31.913
Advance sales are
out of the roof.

01:12:31.915 --> 01:12:33.981
It almost makes up for the time

01:12:33.983 --> 01:12:37.452
you left me alone
to go write in a cabin.

01:12:37.454 --> 01:12:38.820
You're still alive.

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:40.889
Barely.

01:12:44.661 --> 01:12:46.894
Well, Son, you did it.

01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:50.031
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No.

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:51.366
This time you did it.

01:12:56.106 --> 01:12:57.106
Thanks, Dad.

01:12:58.041 --> 01:12:59.107
It means the world to me.

01:13:01.811 --> 01:13:04.112
Is that what you really
all you were waiting for?

01:13:04.114 --> 01:13:05.874
You really are a mess,
aren't you?

01:13:07.684 --> 01:13:09.917
If you actually thought anything
you've done with your life

01:13:09.919 --> 01:13:11.119
was worth a damn,

01:13:11.121 --> 01:13:13.621
you wouldn't be so
worried about what I felt

01:13:14.824 --> 01:13:17.625
and you wouldn't be so angry
at the world all the time.

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:22.063
You're right, Dad,

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:25.500
I don't need to be
angry anymore.

Get down!

01:14:34.604 --> 01:14:35.837
What?

01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:56.624
Thank you so much for the time.

01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:02.797
- Mr. Stockridge.
- Detective.

01:15:02.799 --> 01:15:04.866
It is so nice to see you again.

01:15:05.735 --> 01:15:07.235
I feel like you have
a thing for me.

01:15:07.237 --> 01:15:10.505
Mr. Stockridge, I recently
received a distraught phone call

01:15:10.507 --> 01:15:11.706
from a grieving widow.

01:15:12.542 --> 01:15:14.542
I had nothing new to tell her.

01:15:14.544 --> 01:15:16.277
She had nothing new to tell me.

01:15:16.279 --> 01:15:19.714
- Well, except for one thing.
- And what's that?

01:15:21.251 --> 01:15:23.485
Quite by chance,

01:15:23.486 --> 01:15:25.720
poor Mrs. Brennaman
corroborated Ms. Dettler's story

01:15:25.722 --> 01:15:27.755
about rooms on the second floor

01:15:27.757 --> 01:15:30.191
that no one was
allowed to go in.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:31.193
Hmm...

01:15:32.061 --> 01:15:33.761
I see.

01:15:33.763 --> 01:15:35.997
I see, I see, I see.

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:40.568
- I'm a very private person.
- Mitch, I have a warrant.

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:43.538
We can do this the easy
way or the hard way.

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:45.640
I guess you got what you
wanted then, Detective.

01:15:46.576 --> 01:15:47.909
Will there be anything else?

01:15:47.911 --> 01:15:49.644
I need to go meet
with my publisher.

01:15:51.114 --> 01:15:53.147
If you like books,
you're welcome to join us.

01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:58.119
You know I know you never
shed any tears for Luke Rousseau

01:15:58.121 --> 01:16:02.590
and I can accept that you made
yourself not care about any

01:16:02.592 --> 01:16:04.859
or many of the others.

01:16:05.828 --> 01:16:09.730
- Nick Brennaman was your friend.
- And I miss him every day.

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:11.666
I'll choose to believe that.

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:13.601
I noticed you made a beeline
for the room upstairs,

01:16:13.603 --> 01:16:15.937
like you knew exactly
what you were looking for.

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:19.073
I'm not mad.

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:22.143
I'm just wondering
how much do you know.

01:16:22.145 --> 01:16:24.596
I know enough.

01:16:24.597 --> 01:16:27.077
Well, then you'll know no one's
going to believe your story.

01:16:29.986 --> 01:16:33.888
- You're a monster, Stockridge.
- I take your word for it.

01:16:33.890 --> 01:16:35.256
I help people.

01:16:35.258 --> 01:16:38.059
You remember the woman
from the grocery store.

01:16:38.061 --> 01:16:39.627
She said I saved
her friend's life.

01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:41.596
Even you were impressed.

01:16:41.598 --> 01:16:44.031
You think your books
help everyone, huh?

01:16:45.969 --> 01:16:48.369
Well, guess again,
they didn't help me.

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:50.605
How? You act like I destroyed
your life or something.

01:16:50.607 --> 01:16:54.609
But you did,
Mitch the bitch.

01:16:54.611 --> 01:16:58.279
Your little stories,
inspirational stories

01:16:58.281 --> 01:17:00.915
inspired my husband
to follow his dreams

01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:02.883
and walk out on his family.

01:17:02.885 --> 01:17:04.952
So that's what
this has been about.

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:09.890
We were happy, happy
and then you ruined everything.

01:17:09.892 --> 01:17:11.959
You'll never know how many
people I actually helped.

01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:13.628
Where is Nick, Mitch?

01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:15.680
He is not here.

01:17:15.681 --> 01:17:17.731
How could you do this
to your best friend?

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:19.000
You're just projecting.

01:17:19.002 --> 01:17:20.522
- You're a monster.
- Leave.

01:17:21.104 --> 01:17:24.271
You're a selfish piece
of shit and I swear...

01:17:24.273 --> 01:17:26.941
I help people.
My books help people.

01:17:26.943 --> 01:17:30.111
God, keep telling yourself that.

01:17:30.113 --> 01:17:31.646
Goodbye, Detective.

01:17:41.024 --> 01:17:45.259

01:18:12.088 --> 01:18:13.854
<i>Mitch Stockridge,</i>

01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:15.322
<i>his self-help books
are blowing up.</i>

01:18:15.324 --> 01:18:17.324
<i>I highly recommend...</i>

01:18:17.325 --> 01:18:19.325
<i>You should buy
Mitch Stockridge's book today.</i>

01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:22.930
<i>It's changed my life.
It can change yours.</i>

01:18:22.932 --> 01:18:25.166
Wow, Mitch, you're on time.

01:18:25.168 --> 01:18:27.001
Well, I know how you treat
authors that run late.

01:18:27.003 --> 01:18:30.237
Oh, come on, that's
water under the bridge.

01:18:30.239 --> 01:18:31.472
Would you actually have sued me?

01:18:31.474 --> 01:18:34.909
What? You gotta do
what you gotta do, Mitch,

01:18:34.911 --> 01:18:36.911
to get ahead these days.

01:18:36.913 --> 01:18:38.312
Yeah, you're right there.

01:18:38.314 --> 01:18:41.348
Can I get you something?
Coffee, biscotti?

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:43.217
The book must be selling well.
You're being nice.

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:46.220
Well, of course, I'm being nice.
You're back on top, Mitch.

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:50.758
You've got everything
you ever wanted, you know.

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.793
God, you must be so proud.

01:18:52.795 --> 01:18:53.795
I am.

01:18:54.764 --> 01:18:56.230
And you're fired.

01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:58.983
Excuse me?

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:00.801
Don't take it, personal.
You know how it is.

01:19:00.803 --> 01:19:02.136
You've got to do
what you've got to do

01:19:02.138 --> 01:19:03.871
to get ahead these days.

01:19:03.873 --> 01:19:05.406
Oh, come on, Mitch.
Let's talk about...

01:19:05.408 --> 01:19:08.142
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Don't be angry.

01:19:09.479 --> 01:19:11.078
That's the funny thing.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.481
I'm not angry. I'm happy.

01:19:16.018 --> 01:19:17.151
Good luck, Natalie.

01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:22.923
Bastard.

01:19:27.964 --> 01:19:30.197
<i>We have
Author Mitch Stockridge with us</i>

01:19:30.199 --> 01:19:33.167
hot off the success
of <i> Sorry, Not Sorry.</i>

01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:35.336
- Mitch, you got a second?
- Absolutely.

01:19:35.338 --> 01:19:37.338
Glad to be here
supporting the cause.

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:40.575
Great.

01:19:40.576 --> 01:19:43.811
We would all love to know where
do you get your ideas from?

01:19:44.847 --> 01:19:46.527
Believe it or not,
I get it a lot.

01:19:48.384 --> 01:19:50.551
Well, it's sort of like this:

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:53.287
Ever since I was a little kid
I've been haunted by a monster

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:56.023
and I feed it
sacrifices of people

01:19:56.025 --> 01:19:58.859
and, in return, it spits out
an outline for a best-seller

01:19:58.861 --> 01:20:01.128
and I just can't stop.

01:20:02.532 --> 01:20:03.532
Uh...

01:20:04.901 --> 01:20:09.103
Okay, well that's
why you're a writer.

01:20:09.105 --> 01:20:12.106
All right then. Wow.
