00:01.401 --> 00:03.369
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

00:03.403 --> 00:06.770
The Chief's under the spell
of some insane man in camouflage.

00:06.806 --> 00:08.933
Major Owen Hunt.
I'm a trauma surgeon.

00:10.043 --> 00:11.772
You're reading your mom's diary?

00:11.811 --> 00:13.642
I'm not half the surgeon my mother was.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.614
Chief wants us
to give George one of our interns?

00:15.648 --> 00:20.415
You didn't even think to ask for me?
Screw you, Dr. O'Malley.

00:21.788 --> 00:25.485
We can take it slow.
Maybe just... first base.

00:34.401 --> 00:36.494
Meredith.

00:36.536 --> 00:39.528
- I'm only opening one box.
- Plan was not to open any.

00:39.572 --> 00:41.699
The plan was to take
the boxes to the attic.

00:41.741 --> 00:44.437
Look, it's Anatomy Jane.

00:44.477 --> 00:47.241
<i>For a surgeon,</i>
<i>every patient is a battlefield.</i>

00:47.280 --> 00:50.408
- I'll never have my own office.
- <i>They're our terrain,</i>

00:50.450 --> 00:54.716
<i>where we advance, retreat,</i>
<i>try to remove all the landmines.</i>

00:54.754 --> 00:57.780
- And she still has her little twosh.
- Her what?

00:57.824 --> 00:59.985
Anatomy Jane had detachable organs.

01:00.026 --> 01:03.086
I could never remember the real names,
so I made up names.

01:03.129 --> 01:06.064
Like the twosh was next to the chubbel.

01:06.099 --> 01:09.000
And that was connected to the slivvy.

01:09.636 --> 01:13.163
- Oh, and look, it's the jelly pouch.
- Jelly pouch, my favorite.

01:13.206 --> 01:15.504
Still can't get enough
of the jelly pouch.

01:15.542 --> 01:19.535
<i>Just when you think you won</i>
<i>the battle, made the world safe again...</i>

01:20.713 --> 01:22.613
<i>...along comes another landmine.</i>

01:22.649 --> 01:26.210
- Are we screwing other people or not?
- What?

01:26.252 --> 01:29.881
I want to know if you're gonna go
screw O'Malley or some other loser.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.824
Then I don't cancel my plans
with the chick from Peds.

01:35.195 --> 01:38.494
You're an ass.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.493
What?

01:43.069 --> 01:45.799
- That was amazing.
- Yay.

01:46.739 --> 01:48.070
It was for me, too.

01:49.542 --> 01:53.308
- I mean, that was amazing.
- For me too!

01:56.483 --> 02:02.444
My whole life, my whole adult life,
I have been with men,

02:02.489 --> 02:07.017
and it always felt,
you know, fine, good.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.460
But I never...

02:10.763 --> 02:13.493
I mean, I did, but not...

02:13.533 --> 02:15.558
Not like this.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.568
This is like... needing glasses.

02:21.708 --> 02:25.769
- I blinded you?
- No. When I was a kid,

02:25.812 --> 02:29.248
I would get these headaches
and I went to the doctor,

02:29.282 --> 02:31.375
and they said that I needed glasses.

02:31.417 --> 02:34.284
I didn't understand that.
It didn't make sense to me

02:34.320 --> 02:37.619
because I could see fine,
and then I get the glasses

02:37.657 --> 02:41.218
and I put them on and I'm in the car
on the way home,

02:41.261 --> 02:44.094
and, suddenly, I yell...

02:46.266 --> 02:50.566
...because the big green blobs
I'd been staring at my whole life,

02:50.603 --> 02:53.299
they weren't big green blobs!

02:53.339 --> 02:57.366
They were leaves... on trees.

02:58.077 --> 03:00.238
I could see the leaves.

03:01.447 --> 03:04.007
And I didn't even know
I was missing the leaves,

03:04.050 --> 03:08.453
I didn't even know that leaves existed,
and then... leaves.

03:11.057 --> 03:13.389
You are glasses.

03:15.461 --> 03:17.861
I am so gay.

03:17.897 --> 03:20.866
I am so, so, so gay.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.095
I am extremely gay.

03:23.136 --> 03:27.232
Um...

03:29.642 --> 03:31.132
I have to go.

03:41.454 --> 03:45.254
Gentlemen, I want you to meet the new
head of trauma at Seattle Grace,

03:45.291 --> 03:48.454
Major Owen Hunt. You remember
Derek Shepherd, Mark Sloan?

03:48.494 --> 03:50.462
- He stole my patient.
- Mine too.

03:50.496 --> 03:53.659
- Now you'll get a chance to steal mine.
- Looking forward to it.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.691
I talked to a friend
of mine at the DOH.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.568
Now that we have Owen,
we are being reclassified

03:58.605 --> 04:01.836
as a level-one trauma unit
by the end of the month.

04:01.874 --> 04:03.307
That explains it.

04:03.343 --> 04:05.334
My mom bought it for me when I was five,

04:05.378 --> 04:08.905
which was a super creepy gift
for a five-year-old, but I liked it.

04:08.948 --> 04:10.040
Run!

04:18.925 --> 04:23.658
- OK, what was that all about?
- I just saw Owen. Major Owen Hunt.

04:23.696 --> 04:26.028
The guy who pulled
the icicle from my chest.

04:26.065 --> 04:29.159
- I thought he was in Iraq.
- Now he's here, in my hospital.

04:29.202 --> 04:32.933
- OK, so?
- So... So we kissed.

04:32.972 --> 04:36.499
He kissed me. It was stupid,
it was nothing. Stupid nothing.

04:36.542 --> 04:39.477
But you don't think he thinks
it was a stupid nothing.

04:39.512 --> 04:41.912
He obviously likes me, he's back.
What's he doing?

04:41.948 --> 04:45.611
Don't think he quit the military
for you? That'd be severely stalkery,

04:45.652 --> 04:46.710
but very romantic.

04:46.753 --> 04:49.654
I'm not getting involved
with another attending.

04:49.689 --> 04:52.214
Coast clear?

05:00.667 --> 05:03.158
- You paged me, chief?
- Yes, I did.

05:03.202 --> 05:07.571
'Cause generally, when I'm paged to
the helipad, there's something landing.

05:07.607 --> 05:11.543
Yeah. You pulled off a 12-person
domino surgery last week.

05:11.577 --> 05:13.909
That's the kind of thing
we need every week.

05:13.946 --> 05:17.882
It's the kind of thing that shows me
you'll be a great surgeon someday.

05:17.917 --> 05:20.477
- Well, thank you, sir.
- It's not enough.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.683
I don't want you to be just great.
I want you to be the best.

05:23.723 --> 05:27.454
If you're gonna succeed me as the
best general surgeon in this hospital,

05:27.493 --> 05:30.656
you need to start now, today,
which means you need to be me.

05:30.697 --> 05:33.222
You want to take point
on a surgery, take point.

05:33.266 --> 05:36.258
Problem comes up, solve it.
Don't talk to me, just do it.

05:36.302 --> 05:38.236
- Be me.
- Be you?

05:38.271 --> 05:39.363
Be me.

05:40.506 --> 05:41.939
I can do that.

05:42.608 --> 05:45.736
I don't know why you had to bring me
all the way up here to...

05:45.778 --> 05:49.407
That's why. Lake Washington Med
is sending over a 10-year-old girl

05:49.449 --> 05:52.418
with an abdominal leiomyosarcoma.
It's inoperable.

05:52.452 --> 05:56.821
You're gonna have to put together a team
and come up with a plan to save her.

05:57.857 --> 06:02.885
- Save a girl with an inoperable tumor?
- It isn't easy being me.

06:02.929 --> 06:04.863
What's wrong with you?

06:04.897 --> 06:06.125
What's wrong with me?

06:06.165 --> 06:09.566
We've been sleeping together
for a week and already you're bored.

06:09.602 --> 06:12.298
I'm hot and great in bed,
so what's wrong with you?

06:12.338 --> 06:16.274
I didn't say I was bored. I asked if
I should keep sleeping with Michelle.

06:16.309 --> 06:19.107
I'm asking if you're all in.
What's wrong with that?

06:19.145 --> 06:23.980
You're a barbarian. How can I be
all in with an actual barbarian?

06:24.016 --> 06:28.112
Fine. Claudia in Radiology thinks
I have a hot ass. I'll tap that next.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.382
You do that.

06:29.422 --> 06:32.550
Would you mind picking up...
Lexie, I'm your roommate.

06:32.592 --> 06:34.787
- You'll eventually have to talk to me.
- I reject that supposition.

06:34.827 --> 06:38.126
- I reject your rejection.
- I ignore your rejection of rejection.

06:38.164 --> 06:40.894
- I don't reject you, George.
- Thank you.

06:41.200 --> 06:45.330
OK, two things. You all have
a skills lab this morning.

06:45.371 --> 06:48.238
It is mandatory. Don't think
about trying to get out.

06:48.274 --> 06:51.334
Second, one of you will not
have to go to the mandatory lab

06:51.377 --> 06:53.402
because you will be assisting me

06:53.446 --> 06:56.847
in my efforts to remove an inoperable
tumor from a 10-year-old girl.

06:56.883 --> 06:58.373
- I'll do it.
- You won't.

06:58.418 --> 07:02.855
You have a hundred delinquent charts.
You will do those after the lab.

07:02.889 --> 07:03.947
Slacker.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.855
How can you operate
on an inoperable tumor?

07:05.892 --> 07:09.123
- Karev is also out. You doubted me.
- What did I say?

07:09.162 --> 07:11.653
- I don't doubt you.
- Yang is out too.

07:11.697 --> 07:14.097
You weren't supportive
of a fellow resident

07:14.133 --> 07:16.499
who couldn't get his paperwork
under control.

07:16.536 --> 07:18.731
What is that?
Grey, is that Anatomy Jane?

07:19.672 --> 07:21.697
- Yes.
- With the 24 removable organs

07:21.741 --> 07:24.301
and the optional parts
to simulate pregnancy?

07:24.343 --> 07:27.642
- Yes. Does that mean I'm out too?
- No, that means you're in.

07:27.680 --> 07:28.704
- Yes!
- Not fair.

07:28.748 --> 07:31.239
Next time you'll know
to bring in an ugly doll.

07:34.554 --> 07:37.682
Dr. Yang, what exactly happens
in a skills lab?

07:37.723 --> 07:40.988
- Who are you?
- I'm your new intern. Ryan Spalding.

07:41.027 --> 07:44.588
I'm never gonna remember that.
You're... 4.2.

07:48.434 --> 07:49.799
Three, Three.

07:49.836 --> 07:52.100
- Is everything OK?
- Shut up. Don't move.

07:52.905 --> 07:54.930
I'm Dr. Hunt. Over the next few months

07:54.974 --> 07:58.000
I'll be teaching you how to work
quickly and efficiently

07:58.044 --> 08:00.137
to keep someone alive
in the circumstances

08:00.179 --> 08:03.012
where the safe bet is they're dead
by the end of the hour.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.609
Anyone have a problem
working with live tissue?

08:05.651 --> 08:06.913
- Live tissue?
- Anyone?

08:06.953 --> 08:09.513
Speak now. In fact, leave now.

08:09.555 --> 08:11.682
If not, I own you
for the rest of the day.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.557
Good. Here we go.

08:23.636 --> 08:26.366
Each resident gets a pig,
interns assist.

08:26.405 --> 08:27.463
Hang on.

08:40.119 --> 08:41.950
Go ahead.

08:41.988 --> 08:43.386
Save their lives.

08:57.003 --> 08:58.163
You're a monster.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.571
They're under,
they didn't feel any pain.

09:01.607 --> 09:04.337
- You stabbed them!
- Yeah, so we can save them.

09:04.377 --> 09:08.245
We can practice on surgical mannequins.
We can learn to do the same stuff.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.841
- Does that mean you're out?
- Yeah, I'm out!

09:10.883 --> 09:14.080
In that case, who wants two pigs?

09:17.890 --> 09:23.453
Tori Begler, age 10.
Tori has an abdominal leiomyosarcoma.

09:23.496 --> 09:27.364
The tumor is wrapped around
her celiac artery, her splenic artery

09:27.400 --> 09:30.927
and her left gastric artery.
It is considered unresectable.

09:30.970 --> 09:33.200
Did you understand a word of that, Tori?

09:33.239 --> 09:34.866
Not really.

09:35.708 --> 09:36.732
Grey.

09:39.011 --> 09:41.445
This is Anatomy Jane.

09:42.381 --> 09:47.409
- She's kinda funny-looking.
- She is funny-looking, but helpful.

09:48.254 --> 09:52.452
So the tumor...
is way down here in your belly.

09:52.491 --> 09:55.756
Hard to get at because
it's underneath all these organs.

09:55.795 --> 09:59.959
- Hard but not impossible, right?
- We're gonna try everything we can.

09:59.999 --> 10:03.127
Everything you can should include
your cardiothoracic gal.

10:03.169 --> 10:06.730
Dr. Stewart at Seattle Pres said
the vasculature is the problem,

10:06.772 --> 10:10.173
and you stole the best cardiovascular
surgeon he's ever had.

10:10.810 --> 10:14.439
If she's not on Tori's team
we're leaving, going to San Francisco.

10:17.016 --> 10:18.916
Fudge? It's homemade.

10:21.954 --> 10:24.980
- I love this hospital.
- Yeah, no small talk. Come on.

10:25.024 --> 10:27.458
- More lessons?
- No lessons, just sex.

10:27.493 --> 10:31.122
Nothing fancy, just plain
missionary, boy <i>I</i> girl, penis <i>I</i> vagina sex.

10:31.564 --> 10:36.126
I mean it. No dirty talk, no Erica talk.
No talk. Just grunting and grinding.

10:36.168 --> 10:38.602
- Now who's talking dirty?
- Shut up!

10:38.638 --> 10:41.402
- What's this about?
- I'm testing a theory.

10:46.178 --> 10:47.975
Good. That looks good.

10:49.515 --> 10:51.073
Are you petting the pig?

10:52.051 --> 10:54.019
Stop petting the pig.

10:55.855 --> 10:59.552
Spending a lot of time on that
anastomosis. What's your name again?

10:59.992 --> 11:01.425
Yang. Cristina Yang.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.758
Right. Come take a look
at this guy's pig.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.326
- O'Malley?
- This is gonna be good.

11:06.365 --> 11:08.993
- Make way for Dr. Yang.
- See what he did?

11:09.035 --> 11:12.402
He stopped the bleeding, then
moved on to his liver laceration.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.872
But sloppy work
can lead to complications.

11:14.907 --> 11:17.569
Two days from now when this pig
starts vomiting blood

11:17.610 --> 11:19.339
O'Malley'll wish he'd been thorough.

11:19.378 --> 11:22.541
He can come back later, make things
pretty when his pig is stable.

11:22.581 --> 11:25.448
Meanwhile your pig is getting
acidotic and hypothermic.

11:25.484 --> 11:28.078
If this was a scrawny kid
he'd be dead by now.

11:28.120 --> 11:32.489
- Quick and dirty, Cristine.
- "A." Cristina.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.085
Let's guide the catheter
into the celiac axis.

11:35.127 --> 11:36.685
Turning on the fluoro.

11:37.463 --> 11:40.057
What? Excuse me a sec.

11:42.601 --> 11:44.159
Hello, you can't be in here.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.103
That's my Uncle Pat
and Aunt Jean.

11:46.138 --> 11:49.130
They like to make sure
I don't get lonely.

11:49.842 --> 11:53.300
She's not lonely. Dr. Grey and I
are very entertaining.

11:56.615 --> 12:01.552
OK, fine. They have to stay in there.
There's radiation in here.

12:03.255 --> 12:05.746
All right, let's inject dye.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.961
Is everything OK?

12:17.636 --> 12:20.161
Uh... It's fine.

12:26.846 --> 12:30.043
Owen Hunt is a murdering,
sadistic bastard.

12:30.082 --> 12:34.576
- Let me guess, your first wet lab?
- He's stabbing pigs, defenseless pigs,

12:34.620 --> 12:36.986
or as he likes to call them,
"live tissue,"

12:37.022 --> 12:39.547
God forbid you should call them animals.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.651
He is the new head of trauma, Stevens.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.390
May not be ideal, but if that's
how he does things, roll with it.

12:44.430 --> 12:47.593
We don't need live subjects.
What happened to "first do no harm"?

12:47.633 --> 12:49.191
That's about all living things.

12:49.235 --> 12:52.136
Actually, I think
it's just about humans.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.630
I'm saying this to you as my roommate
and not my attending.

12:55.674 --> 12:57.335
Uh-huh.

12:57.376 --> 12:59.071
You disgust me.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.973
- Damn it!
- What, it wasn't good for you?

13:04.016 --> 13:07.179
- Impossible.
- It's not that it wasn't good.

13:07.219 --> 13:09.517
It's that it was.

13:12.992 --> 13:16.587
- A "thank you" would've been nice.
- You paged me?

13:16.629 --> 13:19.792
Got a 10-year-old girl with a tumor
wrapped around her aorta.

13:19.832 --> 13:22.494
- I'm putting together a team.
- This is her angio?

13:22.535 --> 13:25.003
Thing is wrapped around
five major arteries.

13:25.037 --> 13:28.837
- It's bad, but I've got ideas.
- Try them on someone who might live.

13:28.874 --> 13:31.502
I admit it doesn't look great,

13:31.544 --> 13:36.379
- but her family mentioned you by name.
- That's nice, but I really don't care.

13:36.415 --> 13:38.440
Well, I do.

13:38.484 --> 13:42.284
Don't get emotional, Bailey.
No one likes a girl who gets emotional.

13:44.089 --> 13:48.082
Still, I'd like you on my team.

13:52.198 --> 13:55.258
I'm sorry about this, little guy.
It must've been awful.

13:55.301 --> 13:58.464
One day you're at some beautiful farm
out in the country,

13:58.504 --> 14:02.065
breathing in the fresh air,
lounging in the mud with your friends.

14:02.107 --> 14:03.972
Next thing you know you're sedated

14:04.009 --> 14:06.534
- and stabbed in some skills lab.
- Get it together.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.240
Heads up.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.714
Take your interns down to ER.
I'll meet you.

14:10.749 --> 14:14.617
Multiple MVC. Six incoming.
You, lab's over. Do your charts.

14:14.653 --> 14:16.484
- What about my pig?
- She's got it.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.149
- What?
- You're staying here.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.624
With a half dozen crash victims
into the pit?

14:20.659 --> 14:23.822
You have four struggling victims here.
Keep them alive.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.832
Karev gets to work on people
and I have 300 pounds of bacon?

14:26.866 --> 14:29.528
Live bacon. They better be
that way when I get back.

14:34.506 --> 14:38.704
Thirty-five-year-old backseat passenger,
forehead versus window, the window won.

14:38.744 --> 14:41.577
Second-degree burns on the left side.
Vitals stable en route.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.047
Trauma one. What do you got?

14:43.082 --> 14:46.882
Charles Hiott, 46. Positive ecchymosis
over abdomen. Last BP 96 over 68.

14:46.919 --> 14:48.318
Know how to do a trauma ultrasound?

14:48.354 --> 14:50.049
- Yes.
- In that case he's yours.

14:50.089 --> 14:52.557
- Can I help you?
- Dr. Karev paged us.

14:52.591 --> 14:53.888
Got it covered.

14:53.926 --> 14:56.326
A head injury and burns.
Don't think you have it covered.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.330
- Karev, are you a doctor?
- Yes, sir.

14:58.364 --> 15:00.924
Capable of assessing
a patient's injuries?

15:00.966 --> 15:02.661
- Yep.
- Like I said, got it covered.

15:02.701 --> 15:04.362
- Let us dive in.
- Appreciate it,

15:04.403 --> 15:06.496
but I want my residents
to learn to deal with trauma.

15:06.538 --> 15:08.563
They won't learn as much or as fast

15:08.607 --> 15:12.634
if they watch attendings do it
unless that attending is me.

15:14.113 --> 15:17.207
Three other hospitals
have already sent them away.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.774
And if we were smart,
we would do the same thing.

15:19.818 --> 15:21.809
What is the matter with you?

15:23.122 --> 15:25.352
We can try and cut around the stomach.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.655
No. The only way to do that
is to take it out.

15:27.693 --> 15:31.424
- They've done ex-vivo autotransplants.
- With livers and kidneys.

15:31.463 --> 15:33.931
Why don't we take out
the stomach and kidneys?

15:33.966 --> 15:36.127
That'd be great,
if you wanted to kill her.

15:36.168 --> 15:39.501
We're talking about two completely
different blood supplies here.

15:39.538 --> 15:41.768
So no, not a good idea, Grey.

15:44.343 --> 15:45.674
Who are those people?

15:46.245 --> 15:50.705
Uh, that's Tori's dad, Randy,
and his brother, Pat,

15:50.749 --> 15:53.877
and Pat's wife, Jean,
and Tori's brother David...

15:53.919 --> 15:56.717
- Why are they staring at us?
- I don't think they're staring.

15:56.822 --> 15:59.086
I think they're just waiting...

15:59.124 --> 16:01.149
...seeing if we have any news.

16:01.193 --> 16:04.128
Try and come up with something
before I get back.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.266
Close the blinds, Grey.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.605
- You paged me?
- Rambo's completely out of control.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.438
- Excuse me?
- Hunt. He kicked me out of my own ER.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.239
- Did he kill somebody?
- Not yet.

16:19.278 --> 16:21.838
Call me when he does.
I don't have time for it.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.745
I have a dying 10-year-old and doctors

16:23.782 --> 16:26.410
who can't stop bickering
long enough to solve a problem,

16:26.452 --> 16:30.513
except for your girlfriend who's more
interested in playing with a doll.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.582
She dragged that thing all around
the hospital when she was five,

16:33.625 --> 16:36.150
and let me tell you,
it was cuter in a child.

16:40.065 --> 16:41.965
- Any luck?
- What do you think?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.730
I know you want to be number one,

16:43.769 --> 16:47.102
but we can't take in
every charity case that comes along.

16:47.139 --> 16:49.699
It is a huge waste of resources.

16:51.210 --> 16:52.837
It's your call, Dr. Bailey.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.178
Grey, put that away.
This isn't playtime.

16:56.215 --> 17:00.208
I'm not playing, I'm thinking.
What if we took out each of the organs

17:00.252 --> 17:03.016
where the tumor interferes
with the blood supply?

17:03.055 --> 17:06.820
By the time you clamp off the aorta
you risk damaging the other organs.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.656
- Even if you take them out one by one?
- You don't have the time.

17:09.694 --> 17:13.153
What about if we made the time?

17:15.200 --> 17:19.136
Dr. Bailey, let's throw
some stuff up on the board.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.237
CT showed a subdural hematoma.
Should I book an OR?

17:25.277 --> 17:28.246
First thing's first. The scalp
is bleeding. What do you do?

17:28.280 --> 17:30.942
- Normally I page Shepherd.
- Shepherd's not here.

17:30.983 --> 17:34.009
- What do you do to stop the bleeding?
- Suture laceration, tie off bleeders.

17:34.053 --> 17:38.046
That'll take two hours. What would you
use in this room to take care of this?

17:38.090 --> 17:39.819
- Staples?
- It's his forehead.

17:39.858 --> 17:43.089
Want this guy to look like
Frankenstein the rest of his life?

17:43.128 --> 17:44.561
- Skin glue.
- Excellent.

17:44.596 --> 17:47.531
Clean it, close it,
stick a pressure dressing over it.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.501
- How are you feeling, Mr. Hiott?
- Not too good.

17:50.536 --> 17:52.527
How'll we make Mr. Hiott feel better?

17:52.571 --> 17:55.563
Ultrasound showed free fluid.
We'll get him to a CT to confirm.

17:55.607 --> 17:58.576
- Pretty much OR bound.
- Excellent. Is that tetanus?

17:58.610 --> 18:01.977
Know who we have to thank for
the invention of the tetanus shot?

18:02.014 --> 18:05.415
Horses. First experiments
were done on horses.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.389
Want to take out
her abdominal organs?

18:11.423 --> 18:14.654
- Intestines, stomach, everything?
- All at once?

18:14.693 --> 18:15.785
That's right.

18:15.828 --> 18:19.127
We'll put the organs on ice
while we dissect out the tumor,

18:19.164 --> 18:21.598
then reconnect the vessels
using synthetic grafts

18:21.633 --> 18:23.123
and put the organs back in.

18:23.168 --> 18:26.604
Why didn't Graham or Fleisher over
at Lake Washington suggest this?

18:26.638 --> 18:28.230
They're a couple of smarties.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.935
Probably because
it's never been done before.

18:32.177 --> 18:36.136
It is extremely risky. There are any
number of things that could go wrong.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.910
I don't know, Randy.
Maybe we should try more chemo.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.889
With all due respect, Mrs. Begler,
I don't think there's time for that.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.423
Is it going to save her life?

18:48.460 --> 18:51.952
It's your best shot. Your only shot.

18:56.301 --> 18:59.964
- Then do it.
- OK.

19:02.608 --> 19:05.099
Dr. Bailey, I'm not a vet,

19:05.144 --> 19:09.376
and while I can appreciate the value
of practicing technique on live tissue,

19:09.414 --> 19:11.177
there's a multiple MVC in the pit

19:11.216 --> 19:14.777
and my education will be far
better served practicing on humans.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.618
- Who's babysitting the pigs now?
- My interns.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.853
Major Hunt order the interns
to baby-sit the pigs or you?

19:20.893 --> 19:22.793
- Not the point.
- Make it the point.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.023
I don't have time. I'm taking
six organs out of a person.

19:25.063 --> 19:27.793
See, that's not fair.
I'm not Dr. Doolittle.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.234
The zebras and the elephants
are thanking their lucky stars for that.

19:34.239 --> 19:35.934
I have a question.

19:36.675 --> 19:40.236
Why aren't we taking out the kidney
since the left renal artery is involved?

19:40.279 --> 19:43.976
We can remove the tumor
without doing that, so why bother?

19:46.151 --> 19:48.813
- I have another question.
- Yes?

19:48.854 --> 19:50.879
Why can't you look at me?

19:52.925 --> 19:55.826
- What?
- You can't look at me.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.489
You haven't been able
to look at me all day.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.395
I think you're imagining things.

20:00.899 --> 20:05.893
Oh, I don't think I am.
But, hey, if you say so.

20:05.938 --> 20:11.001
I do. I say so. Instead of worrying
about whether or not I'm looking at you,

20:11.043 --> 20:15.844
concentrate on saving a 10-year-old
girl that we're about to eviscerate.

20:25.357 --> 20:28.224
Dr. Grey, why do we
dissect down in quadrants?

20:28.260 --> 20:32.253
So we can look at the vessels
to make sure we have reconstruction.

20:32.297 --> 20:35.164
- Very good.
- Suction in here, please.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.862
Tori's dad is on the phone.
OR desk wants to know

20:37.903 --> 20:39.734
- if they can put him through.
- No.

20:39.771 --> 20:42.103
- He's insistent.
- I'm busy.

20:42.140 --> 20:45.268
I think... Hold this up
a little bit higher, Dr. Grey.

20:45.711 --> 20:48.339
I want to make sure to avoid... that!

20:49.615 --> 20:53.142
- Let's get some clamps.
- Another clamp, please.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.813
- Right there.
- Let's hang another bag of blood.

20:55.854 --> 20:58.152
Better hope the aorta's
not that friable.

20:58.190 --> 21:01.489
Otherwise all the blood in the world
won't save this girl.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.594
- Ryan, what's Reggie's pulse?
- Sixty-nine.

21:07.633 --> 21:11.364
Really? 'Cause Wilbur's at 102.
I'm pretty sure that's bad.

21:11.403 --> 21:14.497
- Babe's like an ox. Hers is 52.
- Hey, no cute names!

21:14.539 --> 21:16.734
They're not pets, they're subjects.

21:16.775 --> 21:20.768
It's not our job to get affectionate.
It's our job to keep them alive,

21:21.413 --> 21:25.679
so the attending who thinks we're
incapable can choke on his words.

21:25.717 --> 21:28.914
So I don't want to hear Wilbur or Babe.

21:28.954 --> 21:33.323
You want to call them something,
call them sausage or prosciutto.

21:33.358 --> 21:35.588
Wilbur's crashing.

21:35.627 --> 21:39.256
- What? What did you do?
- I don't... I don't...

21:40.299 --> 21:43.632
I gotta re-open that
thoracotomy. Pull that chest tray back.

21:46.471 --> 21:49.565
- Dr. Bailey?
- Removing the organs on three.

21:49.841 --> 21:53.106
Ready? One... two...

21:53.145 --> 21:56.672
...three.

22:00.452 --> 22:02.477
Let me have it.

22:07.559 --> 22:08.924
Wow.

22:08.960 --> 22:13.761
I'll need medium and large
vessel loops to dissect out the tumor.

22:13.799 --> 22:17.064
Mr. Begler again. He wants
to talk to you about his daughter.

22:17.102 --> 22:19.832
- I'm pretty busy.
- I already told him that.

22:19.871 --> 22:22.032
- Tell him again.
- I've told him 18 times.

22:22.074 --> 22:24.372
Chief,
you need to go talk to them.

22:25.777 --> 22:27.768
Hey, you did put me in charge.

22:29.381 --> 22:32.179
I'll be back.

22:33.452 --> 22:36.114
What the hell?
Look at this crap.

22:36.154 --> 22:39.123
Is that glue? You used skin glue?

22:39.858 --> 22:42.656
Dr. Hunt wanted to get him
out of there pretty quick.

22:42.694 --> 22:45.424
Because Dr. Hunt didn't
have you revise the wound,

22:45.464 --> 22:47.329
he could lose half his face.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.630
You can't rotate a flap,
you call someone who can.

22:49.668 --> 22:52.296
He says the ER's like being
in the field. Use what's available.

22:52.337 --> 22:56.467
What qualifies us as a war zone, Karev?
Our undermanned gift shop?

22:56.508 --> 22:58.976
The lukewarm drinks
from the coffee cart?

22:59.010 --> 23:00.773
Guy's a meatballer. What do you expect?

23:00.812 --> 23:03.178
- Meatballer?
- Trauma guys slap it together.

23:06.485 --> 23:09.215
- Dr. Webber, how's Tori?
- Stable.

23:09.254 --> 23:12.485
We're removing the tumor.
I should be in there to help,

23:12.524 --> 23:15.152
- but I'm out here instead.
- I just needed an update.

23:15.193 --> 23:17.627
Not important you get
an update right now.

23:17.662 --> 23:20.597
The best doctors we have
are focused on your daughter.

23:20.632 --> 23:23.863
Calls and interruptions
don't help us focus.

23:23.902 --> 23:27.531
I'm sorry. I know we have been
underfoot sometimes,

23:27.572 --> 23:29.665
but we have been to a lot of hospitals,

23:29.708 --> 23:32.677
and hospitals are not easy places
to get information.

23:32.711 --> 23:35.908
A lot of times it's impossible
to get a doctor to talk to you

23:35.947 --> 23:38.211
or to get the doctors
to talk to each other.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.879
And I don't know if it's neglect
or their egos getting in the way,

23:41.920 --> 23:45.412
I don't care. We're just trying
to take care of our little girl.

23:45.457 --> 23:48.824
She's 10, she's scared and she's sick.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.022
We're doing whatever we can.

23:55.534 --> 23:58.094
Don't ever stop
taking care of her like that.

24:02.407 --> 24:05.035
Stevens, have you ever used
a GIA stapler?

24:05.076 --> 24:07.374
No, but I'm ready, I can handle it.

24:07.412 --> 24:09.846
Answer me three questions
and I'll let you.

24:09.881 --> 24:12.042
- OK.
- Question one:

24:12.083 --> 24:15.382
The polio vaccine, which animal
do we have to thank for that?

24:15.420 --> 24:18.651
- This really necessary?
- Only if you want to use that stapler.

24:18.690 --> 24:20.920
- Flipper babies.
- What?

24:20.959 --> 24:24.520
Flipper babies. Ten thousand babies
were born with birth defects

24:24.563 --> 24:27.498
in the 1950s because their pregnant
mothers took Thalidomide.

24:27.532 --> 24:30.865
First developed on guinea pigs.
Guinea pigs didn't have side effects.

24:30.902 --> 24:31.926
And your point?

24:31.970 --> 24:35.462
My point is that humans and animals
have different physiologies,

24:35.507 --> 24:38.442
- different reactions.
- They can have different reactions.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.844
- Doesn't mean they will.
- Tell that to those babies and moms.

24:42.414 --> 24:45.713
So the polio vaccine,
developed using mice and monkeys.

24:45.750 --> 24:49.015
You can keep your stapler.
It's not worth it.

24:50.622 --> 24:52.681
Give me the status on Reggie and Paddy.

24:52.724 --> 24:55.056
Reggie's fine.
Paddy's pulse ox is low but stable.

24:55.093 --> 24:56.424
- Babe?
- Holding steady.

24:56.461 --> 24:58.429
Thought we weren't supposed
to give them names.

24:58.463 --> 25:02.126
I could give them numbers but then
I'd tell you Three needs antibiotics

25:02.167 --> 25:04.533
and find you shoving a needle
in Grey's ass.

25:04.569 --> 25:06.628
His vitals
are getting worse, damn it.

25:06.671 --> 25:09.697
- Uh, did you check his lung?
- I took out an entire lobe.

25:09.741 --> 25:12.073
- His descending aorta?
- I've tried everything.

25:12.110 --> 25:14.101
Pulseless.

25:14.145 --> 25:16.272
That's it. We need
to give him more exposure.

25:16.314 --> 25:20.011
- You're opening him up more?
- I need everyone's help, stem to stern.

25:21.019 --> 25:23.487
What if he can't take it?
You could kill him.

25:23.522 --> 25:27.356
Don't get emotional. Get ready to
start massaging his heart. Scalpel.

25:30.795 --> 25:32.990
Bailey, can you
dissect any more?

25:33.031 --> 25:36.364
There's nothing to dissect.
There's barely any artery left.

25:36.401 --> 25:38.801
What about if we extend
the Gore-Tex graft?

25:38.837 --> 25:40.805
What's left is too friable.

25:40.839 --> 25:43.307
We can't reconnect the organs
to the vessels?

25:43.341 --> 25:47.437
- Not at this moment. No.
- But if we can't reconnect,

25:47.479 --> 25:49.470
they won't reperfuse and they'll die.

25:49.514 --> 25:52.142
- Yes, they will.
- Too late for a transplant?

25:52.183 --> 25:55.949
Well, we'd have to find six
good organs in about eight hours.

25:55.987 --> 25:59.718
- It's too late for a transplant.
- And a gold star for Grey.

26:09.768 --> 26:12.498
We could
put in more Gore-Tex.

26:12.537 --> 26:14.129
Oh, put even more
synthetic material in?

26:14.172 --> 26:17.733
- What about a saphenous vein graft?
- She's getting acidotic.

26:17.776 --> 26:20.438
- That has to be pre-planned.
- What's your idea?

26:20.478 --> 26:21.502
Excuse me?

26:21.546 --> 26:24.413
You're good at shooting down every idea
we come up with. What's yours?

26:24.449 --> 26:27.680
It was my idea not to do this
in the first place, Dr. Bailey.

26:27.719 --> 26:30.882
Yeah, and you made that very clear
every chance you got.

26:30.922 --> 26:34.050
Shut up! I don't care
who had what idea when.

26:34.092 --> 26:38.153
Get over yourselves.
Shut up and talk to each other.

26:43.935 --> 26:49.305
What about using
human umbilical vein?

26:49.341 --> 26:54.438
- Ready to go, already heparinized.
- OK. I like it.

26:54.479 --> 26:57.141
- Erica, what do you think?
- It could work.

26:57.182 --> 27:00.413
It's Dr. Bailey's call,
if she wants to do it.

27:00.986 --> 27:05.013
- I do.
- OK, in that case, let's do it.

27:06.358 --> 27:08.383
Nice work on the valve.

27:08.426 --> 27:11.623
First developed in pigs, but more
recently in cows.

27:11.663 --> 27:15.258
Are you done beating me up for the day
because I'd like to go home.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.791
- I was trying to teach you.
- You want to teach us?

27:17.836 --> 27:21.272
Take us to the Simulab with
the plastic guys who have heart rates

27:21.306 --> 27:24.104
and blood pressure and croak
when you nick an artery.

27:24.142 --> 27:27.737
Until you apply scalpel to skin
you're just going through motions.

27:27.779 --> 27:29.542
That attitude? That's from before.

27:29.581 --> 27:31.981
We have technology.
We don't have to torture creatures.

27:32.851 --> 27:34.785
You don't get to accuse me of torture.
Those animals felt no pain.

27:34.819 --> 27:37.219
You don't know that.
You don't know that.

27:37.255 --> 27:41.089
You don't know what they felt,
you don't know how scared they were.

27:41.126 --> 27:44.095
Animals are sensitive
and intelligent creatures.

27:44.129 --> 27:47.758
And that is not me being emotional,
that is simply the truth.

27:47.799 --> 27:51.701
Want me to learn from your methods?
Want me to learn anything from you?

27:51.736 --> 27:56.139
Then don't stab pigs in front of me
and tell me the sky isn't blue.

27:56.174 --> 27:59.974
You are torturing God's creatures in
an age where we have the technology

28:00.011 --> 28:03.208
that no longer requires us to.
If you want to do that, go ahead,

28:03.248 --> 28:06.183
but don't tell me I'm less
of a doctor for walking away.

28:08.920 --> 28:12.378
Come on, Wilbur, don't do this.

28:13.391 --> 28:15.689
His heart's not filling. You know...

28:15.727 --> 28:19.026
Massage it with both hands,
like a heart sandwich.

28:19.064 --> 28:21.328
Good. Good.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.034
There! Right there. Stupid.
Look at that.

28:25.070 --> 28:28.301
The knife went through
his diaphragm into his spleen. OK.

28:28.339 --> 28:29.829
Hand me those clamps.

28:29.874 --> 28:32.672
We've got blood pooling
the lower left quadrant.

28:32.711 --> 28:37.239
- Anybody see where it's coming from?
- Here. This graft. Satinsky clamps.

28:37.282 --> 28:39.750
- And four-0 Prolene.
- Scissors.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.545
Waiting, Dr. Bailey.

28:46.324 --> 28:48.554
OK,
this thing's coming out.

28:49.794 --> 28:51.762
We're still waiting, Dr. Bailey.

28:51.796 --> 28:55.197
OK. Suction. Clear it out.

28:56.801 --> 28:58.291
OK, release clamps.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.233
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

29:03.274 --> 29:05.970
- Right in here.
- Still nothing.

29:07.145 --> 29:08.806
No pulsation.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.850
Come on, come on.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.883
Reperfusion complete!

29:20.291 --> 29:22.452
The heart's beating on its own.

29:24.796 --> 29:25.820
All right!

29:28.867 --> 29:29.891
All right.

29:30.969 --> 29:34.132
Everyone, hell of a job.

29:40.779 --> 29:44.875
I've known women to be upset because
they couldn't make it to the big finish.

29:44.916 --> 29:46.884
Never had anything to do with me.

29:46.918 --> 29:49.352
Usually something to do
with their anatomy.

29:49.387 --> 29:52.083
Point is, I've never known
a woman to be upset

29:52.123 --> 29:56.958
because she could take a curtain call.
You're a conundrum, Torres.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.155
Erica cried this morning.

30:01.199 --> 30:04.464
In bed. After sex.

30:04.502 --> 30:07.596
That was a compliment, for you.

30:07.639 --> 30:11.632
- The crying was a compliment.
- It wasn't a compliment for me.

30:11.676 --> 30:15.635
She was having a revelation.
She was having...

30:16.281 --> 30:18.374
The sex is awesome with Erica.

30:19.951 --> 30:23.182
We've reached awesome, which is...

30:23.221 --> 30:26.349
- Awesome.
- Yes, but it's also awesome with you.

30:26.391 --> 30:28.655
So, what's the problem?

30:30.161 --> 30:33.130
Guess I thought there should be
a difference...

30:33.164 --> 30:35.598
...between you and Erica.

30:36.100 --> 30:40.002
If I'm... There should be a difference.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.537
The difference between me and Erica

30:45.577 --> 30:49.138
is that I know you had sex
with her 12 hours ago.

30:49.180 --> 30:52.707
She doesn't know you had sex with me,
and that makes you a cheater.

30:52.750 --> 30:56.311
Do you want to be a cheater?
'Cause I'm fine with it.

30:56.354 --> 30:59.016
The question is, are you?

31:01.926 --> 31:03.985
Gonna yell at the major general.
Wanna come?

31:04.028 --> 31:07.361
- Hell yeah. Be right there.
- Hey, Torres.

31:07.398 --> 31:08.797
Hey.

31:12.103 --> 31:14.196
- Hunt, can I talk to you?
- Sure.

31:14.239 --> 31:16.901
- Karev?
- No, no, he can stay.

31:16.941 --> 31:20.308
Want Karev to hear how you screwed up
the flap of my head trauma, fine.

31:20.345 --> 31:22.142
My job's to keep him alive.
It's what I did.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.045
What you did was almost maim a guy
for the rest of his life.

31:24.082 --> 31:26.983
You're lucky I saved the blood supply.

31:27.018 --> 31:30.181
- What would you have done?
- A man with a deep scalp wound,

31:30.221 --> 31:33.850
and two of the best surgeons in
the country standing ten feet away.

31:33.892 --> 31:37.953
I would've asked those two surgeons
to step in. That's what I would've done.

31:37.996 --> 31:41.898
I mean, medically. What would you
have done medically so I can do better?

31:41.933 --> 31:45.801
I recognize there's different ways
of doing things, even the basics.

31:45.837 --> 31:48.499
Here, someone appears dead,
you go to them first.

31:48.539 --> 31:51.838
In Iraq someone appears dead you don't.
This is day one for me.

31:51.876 --> 31:55.607
You think there's a better way
then tell me, and I'll listen.

32:00.652 --> 32:04.554
- Again, both of you, great job.
- Thank you.

32:05.690 --> 32:09.285
Is there a problem, Dr. Bailey?

32:10.228 --> 32:13.823
Just find it hard to believe
you're accepting congratulations,

32:13.865 --> 32:16.834
considering you didn't
want to do this operation.

32:16.868 --> 32:20.201
When you finally did do it,
you fought me every step of the way.

32:20.238 --> 32:25.642
And yet you still had a world-class
heart surgeon by your side.

32:26.244 --> 32:31.648
You may be a fine surgeon,
God knows I know that, but not today.

32:31.683 --> 32:35.915
Today you were a pain in the ass.

32:35.954 --> 32:40.789
A naysaying, bullying,
consistently negative pain in the ass.

32:40.825 --> 32:42.952
At no point did you encourage me

32:42.994 --> 32:46.794
or do anything to make me think this
surgery could be anything but a failure.

32:46.831 --> 32:51.564
And it wasn't just me. You made it as
hard as humanly possible for all of us.

32:51.602 --> 32:56.505
So, yeah, we did do a nice job today.
We did a great job today.

32:56.541 --> 33:00.443
But that wasn't thanks to you,
that was thanks to me and the chief.

33:00.478 --> 33:02.776
And Meredith Grey.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.441
And Anatomy Jane.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.449
Babe is indestructible.

33:09.487 --> 33:12.854
She lost a part of her liver and
small bowel but she's doing fine.

33:12.890 --> 33:16.553
We had to cross-clamp
Wilbur's aorta and massage his heart.

33:16.594 --> 33:18.755
I couldn't locate the source
of his bleeding

33:18.796 --> 33:22.789
until I found a hole in his diaphragm,
realized he had a splenic laceration.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.529
He's a fighter, he's pulling through.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.935
Reggie had some oozing
after his colon resection,

33:26.971 --> 33:29.565
but we packed it and
he's been stable ever since.

33:29.607 --> 33:33.304
Paddy almost bled out because
his carotid was sliced right through.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.676
We put in a graft.
He's been stable ever since.

33:35.713 --> 33:38.181
- He's good as new.
- That's good.

33:38.216 --> 33:40.116
That's great work, all of you.

33:40.151 --> 33:43.780
So put them out and make sure
you write up all your work.

33:44.689 --> 33:47.988
- What do you mean "put them out?"
- Terminate them. Kill 'em.

34:05.243 --> 34:08.940
I'm not killing those pigs. I spent
the day trying to keep them alive.

34:08.980 --> 34:12.210
- Want them dead, do it yourself.
- You resected half of a liver today.

34:12.250 --> 34:15.981
You repaired a diaphragm, did
a splenectomy, grafted a severed artery

34:16.054 --> 34:18.818
and repaired a lacerated bladder,
performed a lobectomy.

34:18.856 --> 34:21.518
And I understand you even
removed a tumor.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.590
On Paddy, his thyroid.

34:25.429 --> 34:28.331
You have any idea
how much you just learned?

34:29.233 --> 34:33.465
They'd be in pain. Those are massive
injuries, months of recovery.

34:33.504 --> 34:36.337
To keep them alive after all that,
it's not humane.

34:39.310 --> 34:41.471
Seriously, you don't remember my name?

34:41.512 --> 34:43.810
I remember your name,
but that was before.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.514
This last tour, I was on
a forward surgical team.

34:51.556 --> 34:55.150
We... treated
combat casualties in the field.

34:55.193 --> 34:57.423
You're mostly looking to do
damage control:

34:57.462 --> 35:00.158
Sedate 'em, ventilate 'em, airlift 'em
to Baghdad, get out of there.

35:00.198 --> 35:03.099
Only this one time
we didn't get out fast enough

35:03.134 --> 35:06.900
'cause we ended up in the middle
of an RPG ambush.

35:08.873 --> 35:12.502
There were 20 people in my unit,
including me, and 19 died.

35:15.146 --> 35:16.613
And then I got discharged.

35:16.647 --> 35:20.606
So... I'm not there anymore,
in the before.

35:22.653 --> 35:24.712
I knew your name in the before.

35:26.891 --> 35:28.722
Now I'm living in the after.

35:44.041 --> 35:46.407
- Erica.
- You want to apologize to someone,

35:46.444 --> 35:49.936
apologize to Bailey. Thanks to you,
I made her life a living hell.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.243
I slept with Mark Sloan.

35:54.852 --> 35:58.379
If that's your idea of an apology,
you seriously...

35:58.422 --> 36:00.219
Shut up!

36:00.258 --> 36:04.718
You were crying and seeing leaves.

36:04.762 --> 36:06.627
And I wasn't.

36:07.465 --> 36:09.626
OK? I may never see leaves.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.903
Or maybe I will see leaves,
but I'll also see flowers.

36:13.938 --> 36:16.338
I might be a whole forest girl,
I don't know,

36:16.374 --> 36:18.365
but I do know that I want to be with you

36:18.409 --> 36:21.378
and... to do that I have to
at least tell you the truth,

36:21.412 --> 36:24.074
and the truth is I slept with
Mark Sloan today.

36:28.619 --> 36:29.984
OK.

36:31.122 --> 36:32.714
Twice, actually.

36:35.626 --> 36:37.116
OK.

36:41.532 --> 36:45.127
- You paged?
- Yeah. How's Tori?

36:45.169 --> 36:46.830
She's good, stable.

36:54.845 --> 36:56.870
You weren't imagining things.

36:56.914 --> 37:00.441
You used to run around here
with that doll all the time.

37:00.484 --> 37:04.614
Took her everywhere.
The cafeteria, the old art gallery.

37:06.190 --> 37:09.353
Tori's got a whole army.
You didn't have anyone.

37:10.661 --> 37:12.891
Seeing Anatomy Jane

37:12.930 --> 37:16.024
reminded me of how much
I was to blame for that.

37:17.935 --> 37:20.904
You're a living reminder
of every failure in my life.

37:21.505 --> 37:23.473
That's not your fault.

37:24.475 --> 37:29.174
And if I thought "I'm sorry" would hold
any meaning for you at all, I'd say it.

37:31.415 --> 37:33.315
I'd say it a thousand times a day.

37:34.452 --> 37:36.317
<i>Some wars are never over.</i>

37:40.491 --> 37:42.652
<i>Some end in an uneasy truce.</i>

37:47.898 --> 37:50.059
I can't do it.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.433
I know I'm supposed to, but...

37:52.470 --> 37:57.271
They'll suffer.
Don't let them suffer.

38:11.989 --> 38:14.822
- So no more on-call room, huh?
- Afraid not.

38:14.859 --> 38:16.622
That's too bad.

38:17.662 --> 38:20.825
Guess I'll, uh, see you around.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.565
Hey.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.467
Wanna get a drink?

38:28.539 --> 38:29.836
Really?

38:29.874 --> 38:32.069
Just 'cause we're not sleeping together

38:32.109 --> 38:34.441
doesn't mean we can't hang out,
be friends.

38:37.214 --> 38:39.444
You're good for more than sex, Mark.

38:40.217 --> 38:41.912
I would love to get a drink.

38:45.556 --> 38:48.719
- She's not gonna cry every time, right?
- No. That passes.

38:55.599 --> 39:01.629
<i>Some wars result</i>
<i>in complete and total victory.</i>

39:08.713 --> 39:09.805
Sit.

39:14.185 --> 39:17.086
Mac and cheese,
from the box, not the freezer.

39:17.121 --> 39:19.681
<i>Some wars</i>
<i>end with a peace offering.</i>

39:24.595 --> 39:26.426
I named the pigs today.

39:29.066 --> 39:31.466
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what that means.

39:32.737 --> 39:34.762
I take things personally.

39:35.272 --> 39:36.967
I get too emotional.

39:37.875 --> 39:41.436
There's no place for it at work,
not with the pigs and not with you.

39:43.414 --> 39:44.779
I'm sorry.

39:52.823 --> 39:55.656
This is so much better
than the freezer kind.

40:05.102 --> 40:08.765
Thought you were sleeping with
Michelle tonight, or was it Jackie?

40:08.806 --> 40:11.297
- Iz.
- I've had a hard day, Alex.

40:11.342 --> 40:13.867
And a sad night.
Please just leave me alone.

40:13.911 --> 40:15.708
- Izzie.
- What?

40:15.746 --> 40:17.680
I'm not good at this, all right?

40:17.715 --> 40:21.276
I'm not good at relationships
or talking about stupid feelings

40:21.318 --> 40:26.017
and you are, so maybe you could
teach me or something, you know?

40:26.056 --> 40:27.819
Tell me what I did wrong.

40:30.127 --> 40:32.891
You don't want us to see other people.

40:36.066 --> 40:40.230
You don't want us to see other people
and that's how you tried to tell me...

40:41.138 --> 40:44.972
...by asking if it was cool
if you screwed Michelle.

40:45.009 --> 40:47.500
- Laughing's not helping.
- I'm sorry.

40:47.545 --> 40:49.035
I'm sorry.

40:52.883 --> 40:55.647
- So you want lessons, huh?
- I want lessons.

40:55.686 --> 40:59.645
OK. You start with, "Isobel Stevens,

40:59.690 --> 41:02.250
you are staggeringly good in bed.

41:02.293 --> 41:05.854
You're amazingly smart,
wonderfully funny,

41:05.896 --> 41:08.763
- and you care about animals."
- That's where I start?

41:08.799 --> 41:11.393
Yeah. And then you say,

41:11.435 --> 41:15.565
- "You want to go steady with me?"
- That's what I'd say if it was 1952.

41:21.412 --> 41:24.540
- Alex.
- Yeah?

41:24.582 --> 41:26.880
You want to go steady with me?

41:28.452 --> 41:31.080
If that's what you want.
I mean, yeah, whatever.

41:31.121 --> 41:33.419
<i>And some wars...</i>

41:33.457 --> 41:34.981
<i>...end in hope.</i>

41:35.025 --> 41:36.856
Oh, look!

41:36.894 --> 41:39.692
I wore this every day
to elementary school.

41:39.730 --> 41:42.756
Nice. Your mom make that for you?

41:42.800 --> 41:46.634
Yeah, right. She probably got it
at the lost and found at the hospital.

41:48.005 --> 41:50.769
- Mer, you should do this one.
- Is it more ugly hats?

41:53.944 --> 41:56.105
- Another diary?
- More than one.

41:56.146 --> 41:58.011
<i>But</i>
<i>all these wars are nothing...</i>

41:58.048 --> 41:59.845
Oh, my God.

41:59.884 --> 42:02.546
<i>...compared to the most</i>
<i>frightening war of all.</i>

42:10.494 --> 42:12.655
<i>The one you have yet to fight.</i>
