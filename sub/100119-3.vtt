WEBVTT

00:12.440 --> 00:14.160
You scared the hell out of me.

00:15.520 --> 00:16.560
What are you doing out?

00:17.120 --> 00:20.240
Do you get vacations in prison?

00:22.840 --> 00:23.680
[whispering] I broke out.

00:23.760 --> 00:24.680
What?

00:24.760 --> 00:25.920
Actually, I didn't even do it.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.400
Someone paid off the guards
and broke me out.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.880
You're kidding, right? Who?

00:29.960 --> 00:32.560
At first, I thought it was Dad,
but then I heard the news--

00:32.640 --> 00:35.640
So, you decided to make things easier
for him on his last day by coming here?

00:35.720 --> 00:38.640
Hey! I never should have been in prison
in the first place.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.160
Judy told me the whole thing
was a covert CIA mission.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.120
Including the part where I got hypnotized?

00:44.960 --> 00:46.040
Brooke...

00:48.840 --> 00:50.680
I have nowhere to go.

00:53.880 --> 00:54.760
I--

00:57.000 --> 01:00.360
-Alex. Hey. What's up?
-Hey.

01:02.440 --> 01:07.480
Are you all right? You...
You look a little off. Is everything okay?

01:10.920 --> 01:12.920
[theme music playing]

01:31.840 --> 01:37.040
I, um... I just needed some time to think.
It's been a hard day.

01:37.120 --> 01:40.240
Well, hey, maybe we can think together.

01:41.080 --> 01:44.240
Unless you'd, you know, rather be alone.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.360
Kind of.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.560
I'll join you downstairs in a bit, okay?

01:49.640 --> 01:53.720
I think I'm gonna hop
in the shower, clean up.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.400
[sarcastically] I mean,
I do look "off" and all.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.480
Hey, no. You...

02:03.280 --> 02:04.480
You look beautiful.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.600
Um, I'll see you later, okay?

02:19.840 --> 02:22.200
We have to get you out of here.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.960
Nobody will look for you here.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.320
So, Dad really resigned over a hike?

02:32.800 --> 02:34.880
Brooke, were you in danger?

02:36.240 --> 02:38.120
-No, we were fine.
-Okay, good.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.640
Because if anything had happened to you...

02:40.720 --> 02:41.720
Stay here.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.640
I'll get you a blanket.

02:44.720 --> 02:45.560
Okay.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.400
[door opens]

02:52.200 --> 02:53.360
[door closes]

02:54.640 --> 02:57.560
Don't these guys have anything
more important to cover than this school?

02:59.520 --> 03:01.680
[indistinct chatter]

03:02.640 --> 03:03.720
[Becca] How's your hand?

03:04.520 --> 03:06.200
Are you hungry? I can totally feed you--

03:06.280 --> 03:09.040
Becca, thanks. I'm good.

03:11.440 --> 03:15.200
-[indistinct chatter]
-Oh, hey, Alex. How's Brooke?

03:17.320 --> 03:18.600
She's been better.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.120
I feel awful.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.920
Well, you should.
This is really all your fault.

03:27.000 --> 03:27.840
No, it's not, Becca.

03:28.880 --> 03:33.080
Look, I love Louis just as much as anyone,
but he made his decision,

03:33.160 --> 03:35.280
and now he needs to live
with the consequences.

03:35.360 --> 03:36.800
-It's what he's been teaching us...
-[Louie chimes]

03:36.880 --> 03:38.480
...since the day he got here.

03:38.560 --> 03:41.840
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys, my dad just texted.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.280
He's on the Greenhouse board of directors.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.120
He said they've already come up

03:45.200 --> 03:47.680
with a list
of potential replacements for Louis.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.280
Now we know how you got into school.

03:49.360 --> 03:52.440
Hmm, funny. You wanna hear this or not?

03:52.520 --> 03:54.120
Well, there's Kevin Steen,

03:54.200 --> 03:57.440
uh, the guy who retired at age 24
after creating a very--

03:57.520 --> 04:00.000
Another useless social media app.

04:00.080 --> 04:03.320
Yeah, let's put the Greenhouse
in the hands of a 12-year-old.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.680
Okay. Um, Rachel Chavez.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.720
She's one of the biggest
venture capitalists in Silicon Valley.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.040
-She's amazing.
-[Louis] She'd turn this place

04:10.120 --> 04:13.560
into a brain factory and steal
every ingenious idea these kids have.

04:14.120 --> 04:17.600
Okay. What about Roger Cupertino?

04:17.680 --> 04:21.160
He's the guy that started
the software company Switchback at age 16.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.920
High school dropout.
Great role model for the students.

04:25.399 --> 04:28.360
All right, so,
there's that one guy, Roger...

04:28.440 --> 04:29.680
-Roger Cupertino?
-Yeah.

04:29.760 --> 04:30.800
He's a legend.

04:30.880 --> 04:31.720
Who dropped out of high school.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.400
But he's a bazillionaire.

04:33.480 --> 04:34.560
That doesn't make a good headmaster.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.920
Neither does someone who's practically
our age and skateboards to work.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.760
Face it, guys,
things are gonna change here.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.560
Yeah, I mean, it's not like

04:42.640 --> 04:45.760
the new headmaster is just
gonna fall out of the sky or something.

04:45.840 --> 04:46.960
[Daniel] Right.

04:49.040 --> 04:52.200
Wait. Hayley, you're a genius.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.400
-What?
-Someone did fall out of the sky.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.120
I gotta go talk to Louis.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.560
[Parker] What is he talking about?

05:03.160 --> 05:05.720
-[knocking at door]
-Yes?

05:05.800 --> 05:07.840
I am sorry to interrupt.

05:07.920 --> 05:11.640
I know who will be the perfect headmaster
for the Greenhouse.

05:16.120 --> 05:21.000
-Oh, hey. You feeling better?
-Um, yeah.

05:21.080 --> 05:24.160
Great. Well, come with us.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.240
We have something amazing
to tell everyone.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.600
[Louis] I wanna thank you all
for being here.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.720
I have a few things I wanna say.

05:31.800 --> 05:35.040
First, I wanna tell Sophie how proud I am
of you, for your brave choice.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.880
I know a lot of you were trying
to protect me,

05:38.960 --> 05:41.560
but Sophie taught us all
what a true leader does.

05:42.360 --> 05:43.920
Most of all, she taught me.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.080
Thank you, Sophie.

05:48.040 --> 05:51.320
Secondly, I want to talk
about my replacement.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.880
-No one can replace you, Lou.
-[all chuckle softly]

05:54.920 --> 05:58.160
I have to admit, I didn't like the names
that were being thrown around out there.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.920
But then Alex came up
with the perfect solution.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.280
I've just offered the job
to Hayley and Alex's mom, Ryan Woods.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.320
[all exclaim]

06:08.920 --> 06:11.120
[Louis] Our most famous
and esteemed alumnus,

06:11.200 --> 06:13.000
and someone I have no doubt

06:13.080 --> 06:15.760
will continue the vision
I have for you here at the Greenhouse.

06:15.840 --> 06:19.160
-That's a great idea.
-Yeah. Will the Greenhouse board approve?

06:19.240 --> 06:23.000
I don't see how someone can say no
to an American hero, do you?

06:23.080 --> 06:26.680
That's so great.
Your mom will make the best headmaster.

06:27.600 --> 06:28.440
Yeah.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.360
And finally, I wanna end a difficult day
with a sense of optimism.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.240
Looking forward, not backwards.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.360
Parker, would you bring
your turntables down here?

06:36.440 --> 06:38.200
-[student] Hey!
-[Parker] Okay, okay.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.480
Hey, you trying to go out with a bang.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.680
I think we all need
a little something to lift our spirits,

06:42.760 --> 06:44.720
and I would like a farewell party.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.440
[students cheering]

06:48.400 --> 06:50.120
[upbeat electronic music playing]

06:57.240 --> 06:59.320
[music continues faintly]

07:09.560 --> 07:10.400
How's your leg?

07:10.960 --> 07:13.680
Much better.
I still can't do my moonwalk, though.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.480
You're still a really great dancer, Max.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.680
He seems to be coping well.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.200
[indistinct chatter]

07:27.280 --> 07:28.920
-[Hayley] Hey.
-Hey.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.880
So, I just spoke to Mom on the phone.
They're packing.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.080
This is crazy.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.360
Yeah, I mean, she said
it was kind of perfect timing

07:35.440 --> 07:39.760
with her feeling well enough to work,
and Dad taking time off from the FBI.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.040
She did miss an entire year of our lives.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.080
Yeah.

07:44.640 --> 07:46.240
I'm really sorry about your dad, Brooke.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.680
I know. Thanks.

07:51.760 --> 07:55.560
Well, having my mom here is a lot better
than having an outsider, right?

07:59.200 --> 08:01.120
Yeah. Yeah, totally.

08:01.200 --> 08:04.280
I mean, come on.
She's an alumni here. She--

08:04.360 --> 08:06.200
Yeah, she was a Raven.

08:06.280 --> 08:09.840
She graduated, like, with flying colors.
It's insane.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.160
-Miss Hayley.
-Hello.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.920
-What's up, bro?
-[Alex] What's up?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.160
[sighs]

08:27.240 --> 08:31.560
Guys, your mom is saving the Greenhouse.
It's great. [chuckles]

08:31.640 --> 08:34.000
-[Alex] I know.
-Yeah! You're right, it's great.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.320
-It really is great. It's great.
-Yes.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.280
Hey, come dance with me.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.240
Okay, but you need to know...

08:40.320 --> 08:42.120
-Mmm-hmm.
-...if this relationship is gonna work,

08:42.200 --> 08:44.200
you have to be
a terrible dancer like I am.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.840
Hmm. Well, you are in luck.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.720
-I'm terrible.
-[both chuckle]

08:49.800 --> 08:50.640
Come on.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.360
[music continues]

09:08.600 --> 09:09.440
Hey.

09:24.360 --> 09:25.200
[inaudible]

09:54.760 --> 09:56.360
Your money. [sniffs]

09:57.960 --> 09:59.480
What happened to the other guy?

10:00.680 --> 10:02.960
I don't know. You should ask his doctor.

10:04.520 --> 10:05.400
Sit down.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.560
He is $7,000 short.

10:12.640 --> 10:15.680
What? No.
No, that's the $20,000 I owe you.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.280
But you're late for one week.
It's $1,000 for every day you're late.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.600
Dude, it takes time
to get a fight like that arranged.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.040
Cost of doing business.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.320
Well, that's not fair business.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.560
I'm not the idiot who bet on the Cubs.

10:27.640 --> 10:31.120
You better stay in shape if you want
to get us the rest of the money.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.480
Hey, Enzo...

10:38.320 --> 10:40.200
isn't that the chick you used to date?

10:46.400 --> 10:47.400
[Enzo] Yeah.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.640
Her name's Sophie.

11:07.760 --> 11:08.640
Ryan.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.320
Carter.

11:11.640 --> 11:13.000
Welcome to the Greenhouse.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.760
[students cheer]

11:17.400 --> 11:18.240
Hey, Mom.

11:18.320 --> 11:19.720
[Louie chimes]

11:22.000 --> 11:25.840
[Becca] Mrs. Woods. On behalf
of the Ravens, I just wanted to say

11:25.920 --> 11:28.720
how excited we all are
for having you here.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.320
You're an American hero.

11:30.400 --> 11:34.680
[Ryan] Thank you.
That is so thoughtful of you. [chuckles]

11:40.600 --> 11:42.600
So, I cleaned out my files this morning.

11:42.680 --> 11:45.160
Anything you'll need
for the Greenhouse, I left for you.

11:45.760 --> 11:46.760
Thank you.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.200
I know this is hard for you.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.240
It's a little easier knowing you're here.

11:55.120 --> 11:58.880
-[knocking at door]
-Come... Oh, this is your office now.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.880
[chuckles] Come in.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.240
-What's this?
-This is my resignation.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.120
-Louis wasn't acting alone out there.
-Ryan, I'm--

12:11.200 --> 12:12.880
Louis, no need. Uh...

12:12.960 --> 12:17.160
Rob, I won't lie to you, I'm unhappy
about what happened on that hike.

12:17.240 --> 12:21.600
But, uh, I know what it's like
when a superior asks you to do something.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.280
It's hard to say no.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.240
I'd like you to stay.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.760
And if you do, I only ask one thing.

12:30.840 --> 12:34.440
If I ever ask you to do something
you don't agree with, you tell me.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.960
[inhales and exhales heavily]

12:38.640 --> 12:39.640
You have my word on that.

12:41.040 --> 12:42.360
I really love those kids.

12:42.440 --> 12:43.720
I know.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.960
I knew I was leaving this place
in good hands.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.560
[chuckles]

12:58.200 --> 12:59.800
Hey. Babe.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.320
Oh, hey.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.400
[chuckles] Wow. Oh, my God,
you came out of nowhere.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.960
What are you doing?

13:07.040 --> 13:10.320
I was just hungry.

13:11.200 --> 13:13.800
I've been so, so upset, you know,

13:14.440 --> 13:16.680
'cause of my dad,
that I haven't been able to eat.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.320
-I know this has been hard for you.
-[creaking]

13:21.800 --> 13:24.360
Okay, well, I'm gonna go eat now.

13:26.440 --> 13:29.480
Shouldn't you, like,
help your parents move in?

13:29.560 --> 13:30.640
Yeah.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.840
Right. I... I should do that.

13:35.120 --> 13:35.960
Great.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.160
Okay.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.280
Alex.

13:52.760 --> 13:56.120
You have no idea what my dad's gonna do
if he sees him here.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.080
-But you can't tell him.
-Brooke, I already lied to my dad once.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.240
I can't do it again.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.840
Alex, please.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.120
For me.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.040
Fine.

14:11.280 --> 14:14.360
You have five minutes to get out of here,
or I'm telling him everything.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.320
I have nowhere to go.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.400
I don't care.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.920
Figure it out for once
and take responsibility.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
Alex!

14:21.080 --> 14:22.080
Five minutes.

14:30.520 --> 14:31.640
Go out the back exit.

14:31.720 --> 14:35.600
[sighs] Hey, I was sneaking out of
this place when you were in diapers.

14:46.800 --> 14:50.160
Goodbye, sis. Take care.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.560
[Alex] Brooke...

14:59.640 --> 15:01.680
[sarcastically] Thanks for being
so understanding.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.360
And Ryan said she'd be honored

15:13.440 --> 15:16.160
if I continue to host
the tech convention at the Greenhouse.

15:17.080 --> 15:21.840
So, in six weeks, I'll be back here again.
I'm sure the time will just fly by.

15:24.200 --> 15:25.040
Sure.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.600
Honey, I'd take it all back if I could.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.440
Daddy, it's not too late.

15:31.520 --> 15:35.040
I'm sorry. I know I failed you.

15:35.120 --> 15:36.880
-You didn't.
-I did.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.680
I think I became so focused on Jason
and what happened to him

15:39.760 --> 15:41.720
that I lost sight of everything else.

15:42.360 --> 15:45.880
The people outside of that,
the people that mattered.

15:45.960 --> 15:46.880
You.

16:51.800 --> 16:52.800
[creaks]

17:22.119 --> 17:23.680
[indistinct chatter]

17:31.880 --> 17:35.880
I just wanted to tell you both,
there is a learning curve for me, as well.

17:35.960 --> 17:38.240
I will be leaning on you two to help me

17:38.320 --> 17:40.800
with anything I might not know
as headmaster.

17:40.880 --> 17:42.600
-Of course, Ryan.
-Any time.

17:42.680 --> 17:43.800
[Louie chimes]

17:45.040 --> 17:46.400
[Louie chimes]

17:46.480 --> 17:48.280
Take it. It's okay.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.320
One second.

17:51.680 --> 17:56.920
-Hello?
-[Enzo] <i>Hey, it's me. Missed you, babe.</i>

17:57.000 --> 17:58.560
Where are you calling me from?

17:59.120 --> 18:01.880
I'm right here, outside.

18:01.960 --> 18:03.840
[Ryan talking indistinctly]

18:05.160 --> 18:08.080
Uh... Ryan, I have to take this.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.160
That's fine.

18:10.560 --> 18:15.600
Leo, while I have you,
I was wondering if you could explain

18:15.680 --> 18:18.120
what happened with Hayley switching clubs.

18:18.200 --> 18:21.720
I really don't know.
It was completely her decision.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.200
I mean, could you tell me
why she wanted to leave?

18:26.840 --> 18:32.480
And I am asking as headmaster,
not her mom.

18:32.560 --> 18:34.720
Ryan... uh, Ms. Woods...

18:36.320 --> 18:37.800
I really think that
you should ask Hayley that.

18:37.880 --> 18:38.760
Ask me what?

18:40.920 --> 18:41.800
Hmm?

18:43.240 --> 18:45.160
So, you two are having
a nice chat about me?

18:45.720 --> 18:47.560
I'm sure he was happy
to tell you his side.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.840
-I didn't--
-Leo told me very little, actually.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.200
[chuckling] Though, I think
you just told me everything.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.080
Thank you for coming, Leo.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.680
Good night, Ryan. Woods.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.920
I didn't realize it was so personal
between you two.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.760
It's not personal. It's over and done,
and happened before you even got here.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.920
-Well, I'm here now.
-And I'm happy about that,

19:13.640 --> 19:16.320
but I still need you to trust me
to make my own decisions, Mom.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.400
[sighs]

19:25.560 --> 19:26.960
-[Enzo] Hey, Soph.
-[gasps]

19:29.600 --> 19:30.720
Hey. You scared me.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.720
Funny, I was gonna say
the same thing about you.

19:34.560 --> 19:37.080
You know,
with you having to move to Colombia

19:37.160 --> 19:38.720
to live with your poor, sick aunt...

19:39.680 --> 19:40.920
I was worried about you, Soph.

19:41.960 --> 19:45.560
But here you've been the whole time,
just one hour away from me.

19:46.120 --> 19:50.760
Look, Enzo, I got the chance of a lifetime
to come here, and I took it, okay?

19:50.840 --> 19:51.960
It had nothing to do with you.

19:52.040 --> 19:53.800
Of course.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.200
You wanted nothing to do
with your old life.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.320
[scoffs] Yeah, maybe I didn't.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.040
I needed a fresh start,
and I needed to get--

20:00.120 --> 20:01.400
You needed to get away from me.

20:04.080 --> 20:04.920
Right?

20:05.440 --> 20:06.560
[Sophie] You know what?

20:07.520 --> 20:08.680
Yeah, you're right.

20:10.720 --> 20:13.640
[laughs] Sophie...

20:15.920 --> 20:18.760
don't you remember
how great we were together?

20:22.240 --> 20:23.200
-No.
-No?

20:23.280 --> 20:28.040
No. You see, I remember making
a lot of bad choices together.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.320
I'm not that girl anymore.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.560
I don't believe that.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.560
You're still you,

20:33.440 --> 20:34.800
and I'm still me.

20:36.720 --> 20:37.720
Please go.

20:38.680 --> 20:42.520
Please go. There's nothing left
for you here. I have to get back.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.240
Good girls are always in by curfew, huh?

21:15.560 --> 21:17.000
[computer chimes]

21:33.920 --> 21:35.920
