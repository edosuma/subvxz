00:00.113 --> 00:01.446
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.480 --> 00:02.613
What is Ms. Porter saying happened?

00:02.648 --> 00:05.316
She's saying that Sally
initiated the kiss.

00:05.351 --> 00:06.517
That's not true.

00:06.552 --> 00:08.453
Monte's career is at stake.

00:08.487 --> 00:10.288
This lie could ruin her life.

00:10.322 --> 00:12.323
Privatization is incredibly effective.

00:12.358 --> 00:14.292
We can get so much more done.

00:14.326 --> 00:18.196
Ms. Keene must prove she
can find gainful employment.

00:18.230 --> 00:19.630
- I got you a job.
- What?

00:19.665 --> 00:21.232
Where?

00:21.266 --> 00:22.400
With Justina.

00:22.434 --> 00:24.435
Someone recently made an
ugly accusation about you.

00:24.470 --> 00:25.470
What'd they say?

00:25.504 --> 00:27.305
That you had sex with your foster brother.

00:27.339 --> 00:28.406
I still love you.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.341
Then why didn't you answer my letter?

00:30.376 --> 00:32.343
What letter? What did it say?

00:32.378 --> 00:33.511
That I still love you too.

00:33.545 --> 00:36.214
If you're ever not feeling this,

00:36.248 --> 00:37.281
then just be honest with me.

00:37.316 --> 00:38.549
I think I did something stupid.

00:38.584 --> 00:40.184
I kissed Jude.

00:40.219 --> 00:41.352
So we think the wife's still inside.

00:41.387 --> 00:43.254
I know this guy, okay?
I arrested him last year

00:43.288 --> 00:44.389
and he had a gun.

00:44.423 --> 00:45.623
Drop the gun!

00:52.598 --> 00:54.432
"For all of us waiting,

00:54.466 --> 00:55.666
our time will come.

00:57.269 --> 00:59.237
The truth will then set us free.

00:59.271 --> 01:01.439
Day will rise, night will fall.

01:01.473 --> 01:03.141
To you who are waiting,

01:03.175 --> 01:05.176
your kingdom will come

01:06.345 --> 01:08.546
for one and for all."

01:10.382 --> 01:13.584
Those are the lyrics from one
of Jack's favorite metal bands.

01:13.619 --> 01:17.155
Jack never did find his
kingdom here on Earth.

01:18.590 --> 01:21.325
He never did find a home
or family to call his own.

01:23.462 --> 01:26.264
But in the Bible, Jesus says,

01:26.298 --> 01:28.366
"Let the little children come to me

01:28.400 --> 01:30.568
and do not hinder them...

01:30.602 --> 01:34.505
for the kingdom of heaven
belongs to such as these."

01:40.646 --> 01:43.247
May the kingdom of heaven belong to Jack.

01:55.494 --> 01:58.663
How was Pearson even
allowed to have another kid?

01:58.697 --> 02:01.199
It's the system, Callie.

02:03.302 --> 02:05.269
Maybe we should cancel tomorrow.

02:05.304 --> 02:07.472
I mean, it feels wrong to have a party.

02:07.506 --> 02:09.173
Well, it's not really a party.

02:09.208 --> 02:12.176
I mean, it's a political event
and I mean, yes, we're launching

02:12.211 --> 02:14.412
the Fost and Found phone
app, but the main purpose is

02:14.446 --> 02:16.380
to draw attention to
the bill, and we've got

02:16.415 --> 02:18.182
state senators coming, the mayor...

02:18.217 --> 02:19.250
Okay. I just...

02:19.284 --> 02:20.551
Look, I... I understand.

02:21.587 --> 02:23.387
Everybody's grieving.

02:23.422 --> 02:25.356
But the best way to honor Jack is...

02:25.390 --> 02:28.259
is not on some beach
or at home feeling sad.

02:28.293 --> 02:30.561
It's doing something
before another kid gets hurt

02:30.596 --> 02:32.363
or killed in foster care.

02:49.281 --> 02:50.481
What was he like?

02:51.650 --> 02:53.184
Weird.

02:54.586 --> 02:56.287
In a good way.

02:58.357 --> 03:00.324
Nobody knows this, but...

03:00.359 --> 03:02.493
I think he wanted to be more than friends.

03:04.162 --> 03:05.463
- He was gay?
- Well...

03:05.497 --> 03:07.398
he kissed me.

03:07.432 --> 03:08.566
Oh.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.602
Is that what you wanted?

03:11.637 --> 03:13.237
No.

03:15.240 --> 03:16.607
I'm not really sure I'm into guys.

03:19.278 --> 03:20.611
What about Connor?

03:22.314 --> 03:23.548
I think it was just the person.

03:23.582 --> 03:24.582
You know?

03:27.185 --> 03:28.519
So...

03:28.554 --> 03:30.354
are you, like, into girls?

03:32.190 --> 03:33.624
Maybe.

03:33.659 --> 03:35.626
I mean, I've never even kissed a girl,

03:35.661 --> 03:37.295
so how would I know?

03:44.636 --> 03:46.637
Hey, baby. Come sit with us.

03:48.607 --> 03:50.308
So sorry that your birthday is being

03:50.342 --> 03:51.642
overshadowed by all this, love.

03:51.677 --> 03:53.444
Ah, it's okay.

03:53.478 --> 03:55.279
It's not until tomorrow anyway.

03:56.348 --> 03:58.282
And are you sure all you want is dinner

03:58.317 --> 03:59.650
at the house for your birthday?

03:59.685 --> 04:01.218
Yeah. Positive.

04:01.253 --> 04:03.354
- Cortney's coming, yeah?
- Yep.

04:03.388 --> 04:05.156
Is there anything we
need to know about her?

04:05.190 --> 04:07.425
Likes, dislikes, food allergies?

04:07.459 --> 04:10.194
Uh, no. I don't... I don't think so.

04:10.228 --> 04:12.330
Except that there's...

04:12.364 --> 04:14.198
maybe something you should know.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.134
Just in case it comes up.

04:17.168 --> 04:18.435
Um...

04:18.470 --> 04:20.504
she has a kid.

04:20.539 --> 04:23.608
Mason. He's almost three...

04:23.642 --> 04:25.576
Um... and it's... it's
not open for discussion.

05:12.547 --> 05:14.581
I had sex with Zoey because

05:14.615 --> 05:17.417
I thought since you never
said anything about my letter

05:17.452 --> 05:18.518
that you were over me.

05:18.553 --> 05:19.619
She's probably the one

05:19.654 --> 05:21.288
who took it out of my purse, you know.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.590
If she knew how I felt
about you, why would...

05:23.624 --> 05:26.460
Because she knows that you're a good guy

05:26.494 --> 05:29.496
who wouldn't have sex with
a girl and then dump her.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.565
Would you?

05:31.599 --> 05:33.667
I don't want to hurt her.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.537
Yeah, and I don't want
to hurt Nick either.

05:39.474 --> 05:41.641
He's been really sweet to me, and...

05:42.710 --> 05:44.377
he saved the play.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.579
Your play.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.347
But the play is over.

05:49.283 --> 05:50.650
And isn't it worse to be with someone

05:50.685 --> 05:52.486
when you love someone else?

05:53.554 --> 05:55.388
Oh, I didn't know you guys were in here.

05:55.423 --> 05:58.258
Uh, yeah. We were... we were just, uh...

05:58.292 --> 05:59.459
Waiting for you...

05:59.494 --> 06:00.560
to go strike the sets.

06:00.595 --> 06:03.330
Well, what if we didn't?

06:03.364 --> 06:05.198
I... I just talked to Nick

06:05.233 --> 06:07.234
and he's gonna talk to his dad
about letting us keep the show

06:07.268 --> 06:09.236
at the warehouse for, like, a real run.

06:09.270 --> 06:10.637
I mean, we could... we
could like, charge admission.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.572
You know, I mean, there's
been all this buzz, you know,

06:12.607 --> 06:14.241
from people who... who haven't seen it

06:14.275 --> 06:15.609
or... or want to see it again.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.377
and I mean, there's a couple

06:17.411 --> 06:19.412
papers that... that want to review us.

06:19.447 --> 06:22.382
I mean, why does this just
have to be our senior project?

06:23.451 --> 06:24.484
Right?

06:29.423 --> 06:30.590
What do you want me to do about it?

06:30.625 --> 06:33.293
Well, I'd like you to tell
him that it's a bad idea

06:33.327 --> 06:35.362
to date a girl who has a kid.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.264
Then why don't you tell him?

06:37.298 --> 06:39.599
Lena thinks that, uh,
he'll just get defensive

06:39.634 --> 06:41.334
and dig in deeper if we say anything.

06:41.369 --> 06:42.636
I think she's right.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.604
Well, I think that if
you had a talk with him

06:44.639 --> 06:47.574
man-to-man about the mistakes
that you've made with women,

06:47.608 --> 06:49.242
he might be a little more receptive.

06:49.277 --> 06:50.377
Should I start with his mother?

06:50.411 --> 06:53.213
Okay, I am not here
to start a fight, Mike.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.549
Well, uh, maybe if you were
a little less judgmental.

06:55.583 --> 06:59.319
I'm concerned about our son
being taken advantage of again.

06:59.353 --> 07:00.487
So, this is about Dani.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.455
No, this is about father and son

07:02.490 --> 07:05.458
being vulnerable to needy
women like Dani and Ana.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.394
Okay, okay. I'll speak to him.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.462
- Okay, good.
- I'll impart my lack of wisdom

07:09.497 --> 07:11.565
'cause God forbid he should
have any respect for his father.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.200
You do remember that we had to take

07:13.234 --> 07:15.335
a restraining order out to
keep him away from Callie?

07:16.571 --> 07:18.638
I don't want him to jeopardize his future

07:18.673 --> 07:22.375
so he can take care of a girl
and play daddy to her kid.

07:22.410 --> 07:24.377
He may be 18, but he's not an adult.

07:36.357 --> 07:37.591
You get all that?

07:39.660 --> 07:41.328
Pretty much.

07:43.364 --> 07:45.465
We shouldn't be doing this, should we?

07:48.559 --> 07:50.059
They want us to come in this afternoon,

07:50.060 --> 07:52.295
so I'm gonna have to meet
you at Callie's launch party.

07:52.329 --> 07:53.296
Okay.

07:54.364 --> 07:55.731
You worried?

07:55.766 --> 07:58.401
It's never fun going in front
of the department of education.

07:58.435 --> 08:01.437
Sally is gonna say that
she kissed Monte, right?

08:01.471 --> 08:02.571
I hope so.

08:02.606 --> 08:04.540
But if she brings that mother, who knows.

08:04.574 --> 08:06.642
Well, I will get the lasagnas

08:06.677 --> 08:08.377
for Brandon's dinner tonight, all right?

08:08.412 --> 08:09.612
- Sounds good.
- Okay. Good luck.

08:09.646 --> 08:11.614
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.

08:14.685 --> 08:18.654
Hey, um, do you know
what's going on with Gabe?

08:18.689 --> 08:23.259
Yes. He is out on bail
pending his parole hearing.

08:23.293 --> 08:24.627
Is there anything we can do?

08:24.661 --> 08:27.430
I offered to talk to his
parole officer, but he said no.

08:27.464 --> 08:29.365
Well, it wasn't his fault.
He didn't know Mariana was

08:29.399 --> 08:31.233
- gonna show up at the warehouse.
- I know, honey.

08:31.268 --> 08:32.434
I'm sure he will tell that to the judge.

08:32.469 --> 08:33.602
Yeah, but if he doesn't believe him,

08:33.636 --> 08:35.371
he could go back to jail, right?

08:35.405 --> 08:38.274
I guess he could. Yeah.

08:38.308 --> 08:39.607
Well, that's not fair.

08:39.643 --> 08:41.443
We have to do something.

08:41.477 --> 08:43.546
And if it comes to
that, we will, all right?

08:43.580 --> 08:44.714
Don't worry, love.

08:46.283 --> 08:47.316
Go ahead.

08:49.017 --> 08:52.817
_

08:57.661 --> 08:59.595
You think your dad will say yes?

08:59.629 --> 09:01.430

09:01.465 --> 09:03.332
my old man in the palm of my hand.

discovered and blow up

09:16.646 --> 09:18.247

10:30.720 --> 10:33.456
any impropriety, even if initiated

10:33.490 --> 10:36.358
by a student, um, that caused me no harm,

10:36.393 --> 10:38.427
must be disclosed.

10:38.462 --> 10:40.329
I just didn't want to embarrass the girl

10:40.363 --> 10:41.730
any more than she already was.

10:41.765 --> 10:47.303
And Sally is going to confirm
that she initiated this kiss?

10:48.672 --> 10:49.772
Yes.

10:49.806 --> 10:52.641
Okay. Ms. Porter, you can step out.

10:54.444 --> 10:55.744
Oh, and...

10:55.779 --> 10:58.581
please ask Ms. Benton to come in.

11:05.722 --> 11:09.291
Sally, thank you and your
mother for being here.

11:09.326 --> 11:11.427
Now, I know this is not a...

11:11.461 --> 11:13.562
comfortable thing to talk about, but...

11:13.597 --> 11:16.565
maybe you can just tell us what happened.

11:19.402 --> 11:22.471
Um, Ms. Porter and I were working together

11:22.506 --> 11:27.309
on our school's Community
Outreach Project, and...

11:28.578 --> 11:30.346
and, um, I kissed her.

11:30.380 --> 11:31.480
Or I tried to.

11:32.782 --> 11:34.583
Tell them why you kissed your principal.

11:36.620 --> 11:37.753
She offered to write me

11:37.787 --> 11:39.321
a college recommendation

11:39.356 --> 11:42.291
to Brown, where she's an alumnus...

11:42.325 --> 11:43.526
if...

11:43.560 --> 11:45.761
if... if I...

11:45.795 --> 11:47.663
If... if you what?

11:47.697 --> 11:49.698
If I gave her what she wanted.

11:49.733 --> 11:52.668
And did she say what she wanted?

11:54.604 --> 11:57.706
Not in so many words, but she was always

11:57.741 --> 12:00.676
flirting with me and
saying how pretty I was.

12:00.710 --> 12:02.411
Sally, that's not what you told me.

12:02.445 --> 12:04.613
That's because you cornered
her at your daughter's party

12:04.648 --> 12:06.682
and tried to convince
my daughter she's gay.

12:06.716 --> 12:08.417
I did no such thing.

12:08.451 --> 12:11.287
Mrs. Adams-Foster is an out lesbian

12:11.321 --> 12:12.521
and she's covering for Ms. Porter

12:12.556 --> 12:13.722
because they're lovers.

12:22.399 --> 12:24.733
So how's your birthday so far?

12:24.768 --> 12:26.435
Pretty great.

12:26.469 --> 12:28.671
Thanks for making an exception.

12:30.307 --> 12:33.442
You know, to your
no-bringing-guys-home rule.

12:33.476 --> 12:35.344
Oh. Yeah, well,

12:35.378 --> 12:37.713
I'm just glad the toddler
bed didn't turn you off.

12:37.747 --> 12:39.515
Right.

12:39.549 --> 12:42.585
No, no, Thomas the Train's
very inspiring actually.

12:42.619 --> 12:44.720
You know, the whole, "I think I can,

12:44.754 --> 12:47.523
I think I can, I think I can."

12:47.557 --> 12:49.592
That's The Little Engine That Could.

12:49.626 --> 12:51.293
Oh, right.

12:51.328 --> 12:53.429
Oh.

12:53.463 --> 12:56.632
This little engine thinks he could again.

12:56.666 --> 12:58.634
If you're interested.

12:59.703 --> 13:01.270
Hell no!

13:01.304 --> 13:02.571
Eddie, what are you doing here?

13:02.606 --> 13:04.506
- Get the hell out of my bed.
- This isn't your bed!

13:04.541 --> 13:05.708
Pack your stuff and get out.

13:05.742 --> 13:08.410
- You can't just throw me out!
- My name's on the lease!

13:08.445 --> 13:10.679
- But what about Mason?
- Don't worry, I'll tell him his mother's a whore.

13:10.714 --> 13:12.548
- Hey!
- You wanna mess with me?

13:12.582 --> 13:14.250
- Don't.
- When I get back,

13:14.284 --> 13:16.418
you and all your crap
better be out of here.

13:16.453 --> 13:17.653
Where are we supposed to live?

13:17.687 --> 13:20.456
Why don't you move in with
your boyfriend and his parents?

13:26.494 --> 13:29.177
- So what happens now?
- Well, they believe she kissed you

13:29.178 --> 13:30.225
and that we're not lovers.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.460
I didn't flirt with her.

13:31.494 --> 13:33.228
You were attentive and encouraging.

13:33.262 --> 13:35.464
Isn't that our job? To encourage students?

13:35.498 --> 13:37.232
Not off campus and not in our cars...

13:37.266 --> 13:38.333
and not without clear boundaries

13:38.368 --> 13:40.202
because without them,
people get the wrong ideas,

13:40.236 --> 13:42.204
especially teenagers!

13:42.238 --> 13:44.406
I have done everything I can
to help you keep your job,

13:44.440 --> 13:47.075
but if it comes down to
that, I can't defend you.

13:55.118 --> 13:56.118
Hey.

13:56.152 --> 13:59.254
- Hey. I didn't see you there.
- Sorry.

13:59.288 --> 14:01.256
- You look very nice.
- Thanks.

14:01.290 --> 14:04.292
Um, I have to get to
the launch party early.

14:04.327 --> 14:06.161
Everything okay?

14:06.195 --> 14:08.430
I think I found out how Pearson got Jack.

14:08.464 --> 14:10.132
How?

14:10.166 --> 14:13.068
- Through a non-profit organization.
- Non-profit? Like a charity?

14:13.102 --> 14:14.436
Well, in this case, a private charity,

14:14.470 --> 14:19.107
who then gave his placement
to a for-profit foster care

14:19.142 --> 14:20.442
company called Arbiter.

14:20.476 --> 14:23.045
How it works is is most
counties will only allow

14:23.079 --> 14:26.348
for a certain limited number
of foster care contracts to go

14:26.382 --> 14:29.251
to for-profit companies, so how a company

14:29.285 --> 14:31.319
like Arbiter gets around
it is that they create

14:31.354 --> 14:34.990
non-profit companies
who get the contracts

14:35.024 --> 14:37.192
and then they turn around and hire Arbiter

14:37.226 --> 14:40.095
to place and care for
the kid and get the money.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.164
- That sounds like a total scam.
- Yeah.

14:42.198 --> 14:45.100
And apparently it's legal,
but the worst part is that

14:45.134 --> 14:49.071
Arbiter's a multi-million
dollar company that is traded

14:49.105 --> 14:50.305
on the New York Stock Exchange every day.

14:50.373 --> 14:53.041
So, you can buy stock in foster care.

14:53.076 --> 14:55.310
And with shareholders to answer to,

14:55.344 --> 14:58.246
there's a great deal of
pressure to be profitable.

14:58.281 --> 15:00.182
- So, can we sue them?
- I suppose we could,

15:00.216 --> 15:02.150
but, um, you know, companies like that,

15:02.185 --> 15:04.152
they have insurance against liability.

15:04.187 --> 15:05.320
What about the CEOs?

15:05.354 --> 15:07.355
CEOs are a protected class.

15:07.390 --> 15:10.225
When the banks went under,
not a single CEO that was

15:10.259 --> 15:12.194
responsible for all of
that fraud went to jail.

15:12.228 --> 15:13.228
Not a single one.

15:14.464 --> 15:16.998
Unfortunately, Callie, aside from Pearson,

15:17.033 --> 15:18.366
I don't think we're gonna
be able to hold one person

15:18.401 --> 15:20.202
responsible for what happened to Jack.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.005
- _
- It's gone.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.107
He took all my money.

15:25.141 --> 15:26.141
Are you sure?

15:26.175 --> 15:28.076
I never took his name off the account.

15:29.212 --> 15:31.980
Oh, my God, how could he do this to me?

15:32.014 --> 15:35.016
This is all the money I was
saving for the new apartment.

15:35.051 --> 15:36.384
Wait, no, hang on. My mom's a cop, okay?

15:36.419 --> 15:38.386
- She's not gonna...
- We're still legally married, Brandon.

15:38.421 --> 15:40.222
He can say the money was his.

15:41.424 --> 15:43.391
Okay, well, do you have
anywhere else to go with him?

15:43.426 --> 15:47.095
I mean, I have friends, but I
can't stay with them forever.

15:47.130 --> 15:48.430
Okay, well... well, what can I do?

15:48.464 --> 15:50.232
Nothing, Brandon. Nothing.

15:50.266 --> 15:51.399
This isn't your problem.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.469
I don't want you to get dragged into this,

15:54.504 --> 15:56.204
- and I'm ruining your birthday.
- Hey, no.

15:56.239 --> 15:57.339
Hey, you're not ruining it.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.340
Okay?

15:59.442 --> 16:01.276
I have to go pick up Mason from daycare.

16:01.310 --> 16:04.146
I... I would go with you, but I, uh...

16:04.180 --> 16:07.149
I have this thing to get to for... Callie.

16:08.351 --> 16:10.152
It's okay. I'll... I'll figure it out.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.120
You don't have to worry about this.

16:14.323 --> 16:16.158
Look, I don't know about
this Arbiter company,

16:16.192 --> 16:18.193
but there are bad apples in privatization.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.262
I mean, that's the point of
the bill, is to weed them out

16:20.296 --> 16:22.097
with... with regulation and oversight.

16:22.131 --> 16:24.432
Okay, well what does it mean if no
one's really being held accountable?

16:24.467 --> 16:26.334
Do you think government employees are held

16:26.369 --> 16:28.069
accountable when they screw up?

16:28.104 --> 16:29.304
I mean, at least with the private sector,

16:29.338 --> 16:31.306
if you can't do your job, you lose it.

16:31.340 --> 16:33.141
I mean, that's accountability.

16:33.176 --> 16:35.277
Look, look, I know it's confusing, Callie,

16:35.311 --> 16:38.280
but we are so close to
making meaningful reform.

16:40.483 --> 16:42.250
You need to trust me.

16:44.053 --> 16:45.120
Okay.

16:45.154 --> 16:47.355
Okay. I made a few changes to your speech,

16:47.390 --> 16:49.257
so Daphne, can you show them to her?

16:50.459 --> 16:52.260
So, I set up this teleprompter app

16:52.295 --> 16:54.229
so it highlights and scrolls as you speak.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.330
That way, you don't lose your place.

16:55.364 --> 16:59.067
Um... I thought I was talking about Jack.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.235
I don't think we should.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.137
Why not?

17:02.171 --> 17:03.338
It's too sad.

17:03.372 --> 17:07.275
I thought sad stories
made people write checks.

17:07.310 --> 17:10.945
They do, but today is also your day.

17:10.980 --> 17:12.180
It's about Fost and Found

17:12.214 --> 17:14.983
and telling success stories like yours.

17:16.117 --> 17:17.319
Come on, let me show you downstairs.

17:17.353 --> 17:19.020
It looks fantastic.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.156

No! No, it's not easy for me to say.

Well, yeah, but I mean,
I... I really like her.

Okay, well, just keep
your head on straight

Positive.

20:14.196 --> 20:15.296
Maybe it's in her office.

20:16.332 --> 20:18.333
Daphne!

20:18.367 --> 20:20.235
She must have taken it out of the mail.

20:20.269 --> 20:22.036
It has to be here somewhere.

20:22.071 --> 20:23.438
Yeah, I don't feel right about this.

20:27.510 --> 20:29.411

Do you think it's the same company?

20:31.247 --> 20:33.214

They're paying her.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.164

Tasha.

21:05.381 --> 21:07.348
I know.

21:07.383 --> 21:09.384
- I'll just figure out another way.
- What are you doing?

21:11.353 --> 21:13.288
I left the pad on my desk

21:13.322 --> 21:15.223
and Callie just wanted
to go over her speech.

21:15.257 --> 21:17.192

21:17.226 --> 21:19.060

21:19.094 --> 21:20.995
I wanted to see how many
people are down there.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.430
Okay.

21:22.465 --> 21:24.132
Well, it's time to begin.

21:32.850 --> 21:35.290
Could I have everybody's attention please?

21:35.506 --> 21:37.607
So, I want to thank
you all for being here.

21:37.641 --> 21:42.612
We are here today to launch
the Fost and Found phone app

21:42.646 --> 21:44.580
and to applaud its creator,

21:44.615 --> 21:46.683
Callie Adams-Foster.

21:53.991 --> 21:57.527
When I first heard Callie tell her story

21:57.561 --> 21:59.662
about being in foster
care with her brother

21:59.697 --> 22:02.632
and being placed in seven
homes in seven years,

22:02.666 --> 22:05.768
many of them negligent and abusive,

22:05.803 --> 22:07.904
I knew immediately that she could advocate

22:07.938 --> 22:10.473
for reform much better than I.

22:10.507 --> 22:14.744
Callie's Fost and Found
web app has already helped

22:14.778 --> 22:18.681
hundreds of kids find services
that they desperately need.

22:18.716 --> 22:20.583
But what they really need is

22:20.617 --> 22:24.487
a system that protects and supports them.

22:24.521 --> 22:28.624
We need reform, and the
over 3,000 foster kids

22:28.659 --> 22:31.694
in San Diego County alone need it now.

22:31.729 --> 22:33.696
So, it is my honor

22:33.731 --> 22:36.933
to introduce a young woman
that I greatly admire,

22:36.967 --> 22:40.803
my comrade in arms and my
friend, Callie Adams-Foster.

22:57.755 --> 22:59.589
The same day I met Justina,

22:59.623 --> 23:03.426
I met a foster kid named Jack Downey.

23:05.629 --> 23:07.630
He asked me to talk about

23:07.664 --> 23:10.800
for-profit privatized foster care.

23:10.834 --> 23:12.668
He was in one of these homes

23:12.703 --> 23:15.705
and he wasn't being treated well.

23:15.739 --> 23:18.641
I had other friends in those homes

23:18.675 --> 23:20.610
who were also being abused.

23:21.779 --> 23:25.581
See, the more kids that
these companies place

23:25.616 --> 23:27.784
with foster families,
the more money they make,

23:27.818 --> 23:29.619
so they're really... they're not too picky

23:29.653 --> 23:31.721
about who they place these kids with,

23:31.755 --> 23:34.624
and they don't have to
because they operate outside

23:34.658 --> 23:35.725
of the government system.

23:38.929 --> 23:42.665
That's how Jack was placed
with a man named Pearson,

23:42.699 --> 23:47.603
a man whose foster license had
been taken away by the county

23:47.638 --> 23:50.873
because he had abused his foster kids.

23:50.908 --> 23:54.610
And those kids, believe it or
not, were me and my brother.

23:55.979 --> 23:59.415
He... he abused us
verbally and physically.

23:59.450 --> 24:00.817
He also pulled a gun on us.

24:03.887 --> 24:05.421
But we were lucky.

24:05.456 --> 24:09.492
We were rescued by a wonderful
foster family and adopted.

24:09.526 --> 24:10.860
Jack was not so lucky.

24:12.529 --> 24:15.531
Through a for-profit company
called The Arbiter Group,

24:15.566 --> 24:17.467
Pearson got another kid.

24:18.735 --> 24:20.436
He got Jack.

24:22.639 --> 24:24.474
And within a day of being placed with him,

24:24.508 --> 24:26.809
Jack was dead. Pearson beat him to death.

24:26.844 --> 24:29.745
And I've just learned that
Justina Marks works for Arbiter.

24:29.780 --> 24:32.615
They're paying her to get a bill passed

24:32.649 --> 24:34.717
because this bill will
award more contracts

24:34.751 --> 24:36.919
to for-profit companies like them

24:36.954 --> 24:39.856
who are not motivated
by welfare, but by money.

24:41.892 --> 24:44.594
Arbiter is responsible
for the death of Jack,

24:44.661 --> 24:46.529
and if you pass this bill,

24:46.563 --> 24:48.531
more children will be hurt and killed.

24:52.669 --> 24:54.570
- How dare you.
- How dare you.

24:54.605 --> 24:55.671
You lied about everything.

24:55.706 --> 24:56.806
Do you realize what you've just done?

24:56.840 --> 24:58.541
- I don't care.
- You will.

24:58.575 --> 25:00.576
Get away from my daughter.

25:06.517 --> 25:07.683
Excuse us.

25:19.563 --> 25:20.796
You okay?

25:32.876 --> 25:34.544
You did the right thing.

25:35.679 --> 25:37.647
Not for Jack. Not in time.

25:41.785 --> 25:44.453
Sorry I ruined your birthday.

25:44.488 --> 25:45.555
You didn't.

25:48.659 --> 25:51.561
Happy 18th.

26:02.773 --> 26:04.874
I love it.

26:04.908 --> 26:06.475
Thank you.

26:10.547 --> 26:11.647
Hey.

26:12.716 --> 26:14.417
Hey, what's wrong?

26:16.753 --> 26:18.454
Why are you crying?

26:18.488 --> 26:21.891
Just so many lies.

26:28.465 --> 26:30.666
Hey, hey, hey.

26:33.503 --> 26:34.604
It's okay.

26:36.840 --> 26:37.907
Everything all right?

26:37.941 --> 26:39.609
Yeah.

26:40.744 --> 26:41.811
She's, uh...

26:47.484 --> 26:48.918
It took a lot of courage
to do what you did.

26:50.887 --> 26:52.855
I'm really proud of you.

27:02.699 --> 27:05.434
- Party's still on?
- Yeah, it is.

27:05.469 --> 27:07.770
Um, Ana, AJ.

27:07.804 --> 27:09.505
Oh. Uh, this is for Brandon.

27:09.539 --> 27:10.606
Oh, thanks. Thank you very much.

27:10.641 --> 27:11.841
I appreciate that.

27:11.875 --> 27:14.710
So beverages and... and
food are in the kitchen,

27:14.745 --> 27:16.479
and outback, you know, we're doing kind of

27:16.513 --> 27:18.481
a serve yourself buffet
kind of thing, so...

27:19.616 --> 27:21.484
Hey, uh, is Callie okay?

27:21.518 --> 27:22.652
She will be.

27:22.686 --> 27:24.487
Yeah. Um...

27:25.589 --> 27:26.756
You didn't tell me you were bringing Ana.

27:26.790 --> 27:28.891
Oh, yeah. We're, uh, seeing each other.

27:28.925 --> 27:31.460
You and Ana are seeing each other.

27:31.495 --> 27:32.595
Mm-hmm.

27:34.798 --> 27:38.701
Uh, she just had a
major slip, did she not?

27:38.735 --> 27:41.437
And she was sober for a year before that.

27:41.471 --> 27:43.673
You know, one slip doesn't
take you back to zero.

27:43.707 --> 27:44.940
Are you sure about that?

27:44.975 --> 27:47.843
I mean, she seemed to go back
to zero when she saw Gabe again.

27:47.878 --> 27:48.911
Stef, I know what I'm doing.

27:48.945 --> 27:50.846
Besides, it's none of your business.

27:58.822 --> 28:00.389
So I told Brandon.

28:00.424 --> 28:01.490
I know.

28:04.795 --> 28:06.495
What are we gonna do?

28:07.664 --> 28:08.698
I don't know.

28:26.883 --> 28:28.551
So what the hell is this?

28:28.585 --> 28:30.553
It's, uh, it's...

28:30.587 --> 28:31.887
it's the sets from Romeo and Juliet .

28:31.922 --> 28:33.656
I mean, it's cool, right?

28:33.690 --> 28:35.825
I thought you were gonna
use the space to skateboard.

28:35.859 --> 28:38.594
Well, I... I was, I was,
but then, um, my friends,

28:38.628 --> 28:40.730
they... they, uh, they
lost the theater at school,

28:40.764 --> 28:42.431
- so I figured, "You know what?"
- Uh-huh...

28:42.466 --> 28:45.434
Do you have any idea the
liability you have exposed me to?

28:46.536 --> 28:47.703
What the hell is wrong with you?

28:49.573 --> 28:51.874
- My girlfriend's in the play.
- Oh.

28:51.908 --> 28:54.543
I don't know. I guess, I just, uh...

28:54.578 --> 28:55.578
thought I could impress her

28:55.612 --> 28:57.646
by showing her how successful my dad is.

28:57.681 --> 28:59.582
Uh-huh.

28:59.616 --> 29:01.517
Hasn't she seen your car?

29:01.551 --> 29:03.419
She's not into cars.

29:03.453 --> 29:05.554
Yeah, she's... she's smart.

29:05.589 --> 29:06.655
Oh.

29:06.690 --> 29:08.591
Then what's she doing with you?

29:08.625 --> 29:11.427
You know, I really like her, Dad.

29:11.461 --> 29:14.463
And she likes me for me.

29:14.498 --> 29:16.532
Apparently not.

29:16.566 --> 29:19.402
If you had to give her a warehouse...

29:19.436 --> 29:21.404
I just hope you're gettin' laid.

29:21.438 --> 29:24.507
- It's... it's not like that.
- It's always like that.

29:24.541 --> 29:27.610
- No, it's not.
- You are not that special, okay?

29:27.644 --> 29:30.513
Which is why you better make
something out of yourself

29:30.547 --> 29:31.680
'cause this gravy train ends

29:31.715 --> 29:33.682
when you graduate college.

29:33.717 --> 29:35.518
If you get into college.

29:35.552 --> 29:37.420
I'm gonna make money.

29:37.454 --> 29:39.688
Okay? I negotiated, half the door.

29:39.723 --> 29:40.856
We'll get insurance or whatever.

29:40.891 --> 29:44.493
You want me to make
something of myself, well...

29:44.528 --> 29:45.828
well how about this, Dad?

29:45.862 --> 29:48.497
How about this opportunity to be like...

29:49.833 --> 29:51.667
an entrepreneur?

29:51.701 --> 29:52.701
An entrepreneur?

29:52.736 --> 29:54.437
Yeah.

29:58.909 --> 30:00.576
Okay.

30:04.915 --> 30:06.615
What'd you tell Mason?

30:06.650 --> 30:09.885
Uh, just that we're having
a sleepover with Aunt Susan.

30:11.621 --> 30:12.822
Did you talk to Eddie?

30:15.692 --> 30:17.827
Brandon, it's your birthday.

30:17.861 --> 30:19.662
Let's have a good time.

30:25.769 --> 30:26.802
Thank you.

30:28.505 --> 30:29.605
She seems lovely.

30:30.674 --> 30:31.640
Hm.

30:32.809 --> 30:33.909
Hello?

30:35.579 --> 30:36.612
Who's this?

30:39.950 --> 30:41.917
Uh, she's not here right now.

30:46.656 --> 30:48.757
Hey, hey, hey, hey, love, what's going on?

30:48.792 --> 30:50.926
Um...

30:50.961 --> 30:54.563
a reporter just called to
ask me about the allegations

30:54.598 --> 30:57.666
- I made against Justina and Arbiter.
- What?

30:57.701 --> 31:00.669
- Am I in trouble?
- No, no, no. They're in trouble, honey.

31:00.704 --> 31:03.506
Okay, listen, if they,
uh, if they call again,

31:03.540 --> 31:05.841
you just... you say,
"No comment," all right?

31:06.943 --> 31:08.677
- Yeah.
- Okay.

31:17.787 --> 31:18.954
Do you, uh...

31:18.989 --> 31:20.923
do you think there's something
going on with Jude and Taylor?

31:25.829 --> 31:27.863
Grr! My man!

31:27.898 --> 31:28.898
So my dad said yes.

31:28.932 --> 31:30.900
He's gonna let us use the
warehouse for the play.

31:30.934 --> 31:32.668
That was easy. Mm.

31:32.702 --> 31:33.903
You seen Mariana?

31:33.937 --> 31:36.472
Mm, yeah. She should be
around here somewhere.

32:06.787 --> 32:08.955
A plane ticket to New York.

32:08.990 --> 32:10.790
For your audition at Julliard.

32:10.825 --> 32:12.659
There's something else in there too.

32:12.693 --> 32:14.861
It's the money from your hand settlement.

32:14.895 --> 32:17.664
- $7,500.
- In an account under your name.

32:17.698 --> 32:19.733
Okay? To save for
Julliard when you get in.

32:19.767 --> 32:20.967
Uh, if I get in.

32:21.002 --> 32:22.802
- Oh...
- You will.

32:22.837 --> 32:25.939
This is why we wanted
you to have it, love.

32:25.973 --> 32:28.842
Okay? We believe in you and your dreams.

32:30.578 --> 32:34.581
If you stay focused, we know
that you'll achieve them.

32:34.615 --> 32:35.782
You hear me?

32:36.984 --> 32:39.686
- Thank you, Moms.
- You're welcome, honey.

32:39.720 --> 32:41.788
- Mm, I love you.
- I love you too.

32:47.728 --> 32:49.863
I will, however, point
out that it says "economy".

32:51.799 --> 32:52.832
- Hey.
- Is Stef here?

32:52.867 --> 32:54.734
Uh, yeah. Come on in.

32:57.571 --> 32:58.872
- Gabe.
- I need to talk to you.

32:58.906 --> 32:59.906
Okay.

33:01.676 --> 33:03.943
Uh, sorry. I didn't know you had...

33:03.978 --> 33:05.812
No, no, no, it's fine.
It's okay. What's going on?

33:07.581 --> 33:08.882
Did you talk to my probation officer?

33:08.916 --> 33:10.617
No. Absolutely not.

33:10.651 --> 33:13.787
Then how did he know that I was
building sets for a school play?

33:13.821 --> 33:15.855
I told him.

33:15.890 --> 33:18.625
Yeah, I just wanted to
explain what happened

33:18.659 --> 33:19.893
with Mariana was a mistake.

33:19.927 --> 33:20.994
Oh, my God.

33:21.028 --> 33:24.698
I'm not allowed to live
within 500 feet of a school.

33:24.732 --> 33:27.500
It wasn't at a school and
my mom was supervising you,

33:27.535 --> 33:28.535
so I thought it was okay.

33:28.569 --> 33:29.569
It wasn't!

33:29.603 --> 33:30.970
I didn't tell my P.O. what I was doing,

33:31.005 --> 33:32.539
and that's a violation.

33:32.573 --> 33:34.941
Well, I was just trying to help.

33:34.975 --> 33:37.677
I don't want your help. I
thought I made that clear!

33:37.712 --> 33:39.546
Let me talk to your
probation officer, please.

33:39.580 --> 33:40.914
- I will call him in...
- No. No. You've done enough.

33:40.948 --> 33:42.716
You know, at least I wasn't in prison.

33:44.719 --> 33:46.519
And now I'm probably going back, so...

33:49.757 --> 33:51.558
Gabe!

33:51.592 --> 33:52.759
Ana!

34:01.836 --> 34:02.902
Hey.

34:04.772 --> 34:05.839
Where's Taylor?

34:05.873 --> 34:07.540
She had to go home.

34:10.745 --> 34:13.580
Are you, like, interested in her...

34:13.614 --> 34:15.547
as more than friends?

34:15.583 --> 34:16.783
Maybe.

34:16.817 --> 34:17.851
Why?

34:19.652 --> 34:21.588
Um...

34:21.621 --> 34:23.656
you know, because you've...

34:23.690 --> 34:26.626
been identifying as gay, so...

34:26.659 --> 34:28.695
I don't have to be.

34:29.797 --> 34:30.897
Well, yeah, of course you don't.

34:30.931 --> 34:33.500
You can be whatever you are, but...

34:33.534 --> 34:35.702
I don't think you can choose.

34:39.873 --> 34:41.741
God gave us free will.

34:41.775 --> 34:43.576
To be who we are.

34:46.614 --> 34:48.982
What if God doesn't want me to be gay?

34:49.016 --> 34:50.917
How would you know?

34:50.951 --> 34:52.585
Because he took away the only two guys

34:52.620 --> 34:53.719
I've ever kissed in my life.

34:54.822 --> 35:00.727
Okay. Jude, um, I don't think
that God works that way...

35:01.862 --> 35:03.563
but...

35:04.632 --> 35:06.399
Jack wasn't gay.

35:07.535 --> 35:10.370
So, God didn't take him away

35:10.404 --> 35:12.439
to punish you or something.

35:12.473 --> 35:14.641
Well... well how do
you know he wasn't gay?

35:14.675 --> 35:16.843
Because he told me that he kissed you

35:16.877 --> 35:19.713
because he wanted to make you
feel better about Connor...

35:21.449 --> 35:23.616
and then he realized it was a mistake.

35:24.785 --> 35:25.852
I don't believe you.

35:25.886 --> 35:27.821
Jude, why would I lie?

35:27.855 --> 35:30.724
Because you lie about
a lot of things, Callie.

36:43.631 --> 36:44.831
Callie, do you have any proof

36:44.865 --> 36:46.800
Justina Marks is employed by Arbiter?

36:46.834 --> 36:47.834
No comment.

36:47.868 --> 36:49.836
Is it true you made
these false allegations

36:49.870 --> 36:51.604
because she found out you were having sex

36:51.639 --> 36:53.640
with your foster brother, Brandon Foster?

36:57.445 --> 36:58.578
What are we doing here?

37:00.412 --> 37:01.979
You'll see.

37:05.417 --> 37:07.418
Whose place is this?

37:07.453 --> 37:09.320
Yours.

37:10.456 --> 37:13.224
Or it will be after you sign the lease.

37:14.393 --> 37:16.127
I don't have any money.

37:16.161 --> 37:17.428
I do.

37:17.463 --> 37:19.063
No.

37:19.097 --> 37:20.097
No way.

37:20.132 --> 37:22.066
No. I'm not letting you give me money!

37:22.100 --> 37:23.201
Look, I... I would've just rented it,

37:23.235 --> 37:25.303
but I... I don't have any credit,

37:25.337 --> 37:28.039
so I gave the guy the
first and last to hold it,

37:28.073 --> 37:31.442
and if you like it, you can move in today.

37:34.112 --> 37:36.113
Wait, you need that money for Julliard.

37:36.148 --> 37:38.416
I don't have enough money for Julliard.

37:38.450 --> 37:42.086
I... I barely have enough
money for a year's subway pass.

37:43.355 --> 37:47.358
If I get in, the only way I
go is if I get financial aid.

37:47.392 --> 37:52.263
So, this money doesn't make
a huge difference to me.

37:52.297 --> 37:54.131
But it will for you and Mason.

37:55.434 --> 37:57.101
Please.

37:58.403 --> 38:00.004
Let me do this.

38:01.373 --> 38:05.042
After careful consideration,
we are inclined to believe

38:05.077 --> 38:06.377
Ms. Porter's version of events.

38:08.247 --> 38:11.449
However, we have another problem.

38:11.483 --> 38:14.085
It's come to our attention that...

38:14.119 --> 38:16.320
you allowed a registered sex offender

38:16.355 --> 38:18.356
to build sets for a school play?

38:33.338 --> 38:34.438
Hey.

38:49.054 --> 38:51.022
So, uh, Mariana told me that

38:51.056 --> 38:52.456
you guys aren't getting back together.

38:52.491 --> 38:55.192
Thanks for not tanking the play.

38:55.227 --> 38:58.129
It wasn't just about the play.

38:58.163 --> 38:59.363
- Hey, Brandon.
- Hey.

39:05.037 --> 39:06.170
Hey.

39:06.204 --> 39:07.305
Have you seen Nick today?

39:07.339 --> 39:10.041
Uh, no. Not since he came over last night.

39:10.075 --> 39:12.276
- He came over last night?
- Yeah, he was looking for you.

39:12.311 --> 39:15.246
He wanted to tell you his dad's
giving you guys the warehouse.

39:21.186 --> 39:22.253
Justina's not gonna get away

39:22.287 --> 39:23.354
with dragging Callie through the mud

39:23.388 --> 39:25.356
because she... she exposed
the truth about her.

39:25.390 --> 39:27.391
Do we know that she's the
one making these allegations?

39:27.426 --> 39:29.994
She posted the restraining order
that we took out against Brandon

39:30.028 --> 39:31.228
on the Fost and Found website.

39:31.263 --> 39:32.263
How did she get that?

39:32.297 --> 39:34.065
Honey, it's public record.

39:34.099 --> 39:36.100
This is libel. It's libel.

39:36.134 --> 39:37.301
We're gonna... we're gonna hire a lawyer

39:37.336 --> 39:38.369
and we're gonna sue her ass!

39:38.403 --> 39:40.071
Let's not overreact.

39:40.105 --> 39:42.073
We're not gonna allow this woman

39:42.107 --> 39:45.142
to discredit our daughter
and then destroy our family

39:45.177 --> 39:47.078
with her lies, Lena!

39:47.112 --> 39:48.412
- 'Cause that's what they are!
- Stef, Stef...

39:53.418 --> 39:55.019
Callie, honey, listen to me.

39:55.053 --> 39:56.220
Listen, okay?

39:56.288 --> 39:57.455
We're gonna fight this.

39:57.489 --> 39:59.323
You hear me? We're gonna fight it.

40:01.059 --> 40:02.360
We can't sue her.

40:02.394 --> 40:05.196
Oh, yes we can. We absolutely can.

40:05.230 --> 40:06.430
No.

40:06.465 --> 40:09.066
We can't because it's true.
