WEBVTT

00:06.807 --> 00:09.343
And... here you go, babe.

00:09.377 --> 00:10.444
You made coffee?

00:10.478 --> 00:12.413
Better. Kona.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.048
I was really looking
forward to coffee,

00:14.082 --> 00:15.649
but I'll give it a shot.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.418
Can I push the thing down?

00:17.451 --> 00:18.652
Not until the duck quacks.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.490
Uh. Uh-uh.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.125
And now.

00:30.598 --> 00:33.101
Oh. Oh. Don't cry.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.269
You did good.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.371
No, it's just...

00:37.405 --> 00:40.608
all my life, I've seen people in
TV commercials living like this.

00:40.641 --> 00:42.243
Mm.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.278
I never thought it
would happen to me.

00:44.312 --> 00:48.516
Well, it's happening,
and... it's not gonna stop.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.251
Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.220
There's gonna be fluffy
robes, fluffy dogs

00:52.253 --> 00:55.456
and push-down
coffee forever?

00:55.489 --> 00:58.292
You want me
to lie to you? Sure.

00:58.326 --> 01:00.861
I wish I didn't
have to go home tonight.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.730
Yeah, me, too.
But, you know,

01:02.763 --> 01:04.632
it's... it's hours away.
I'll tell you what.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.567
Why don't we take
a walk on the beach,

01:06.600 --> 01:09.470
and then we'll warm up on
the pier with some clam chowder.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.305
In sourdough bowls?

01:11.339 --> 01:14.608
Well, they're always
disappointing, but sure.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.578
Mm.
What's that?

01:17.611 --> 01:19.147
Our scones are ready.

01:19.180 --> 01:22.383
Scones

01:22.416 --> 01:25.085
Kiss me, so I know this is
really happening.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.856
* Sunshine, lollipops and

01:28.889 --> 01:31.525
* Rainbows,
everything that's wonderful *

01:31.559 --> 01:34.528
* Is what I feel
when we're together *

01:34.562 --> 01:37.665
* Brighter than a lucky penny

01:37.698 --> 01:39.667
* When you're near the rain...

01:46.374 --> 01:49.777
And I'm me again.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.414
*

02:09.697 --> 02:13.934
Hamilton. We had
tickets to Hamilton.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.270
It was a high school
production, Bonnie.

02:16.304 --> 02:19.207
Still a tough ticket.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.941
I'm sorry.
I know it's an imposition,

02:20.974 --> 02:23.477
but my car is completely dead.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.347
Why did you call us
instead of Patrick?

02:26.380 --> 02:28.482
Because he's a new boyfriend
and everything's perfect.

02:28.516 --> 02:31.919
I don't want him to know
what a mess I am.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.954
You live with your mom
and you're an alcoholic;

02:33.987 --> 02:36.490
those are fairly large
bread crumbs.

02:36.524 --> 02:39.227
What'd the mechanic say?

02:39.260 --> 02:41.229
That I should have
changed my oil

02:41.262 --> 02:43.531
at least once
since I got the car.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.266
You never changed
your oil?

02:45.299 --> 02:47.835
I meant to.
I even put a Post-it in my car

02:47.868 --> 02:49.603
that said "change oil."

02:49.637 --> 02:53.241
And then I put my gum in it,
and that was five years ago.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.877
How are you gonna get by
without a car?

02:56.910 --> 02:58.779
I thought maybe my mom...

02:58.812 --> 02:59.880
Nope!

02:59.913 --> 03:01.515
Please?

03:01.549 --> 03:03.384
My car has 400,000 miles on it.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.953
One week with your crazy
schedule, and it'll just be me

03:05.986 --> 03:08.956
taping you to 50 balloons,
hoping for the best.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.992
Well, can I at least
hitch a ride to meetings?

03:12.025 --> 03:13.727
Of course.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.963
But I am listening
to Spanish language tapes,

03:15.996 --> 03:18.999
so you'll have
to shut-o el trap-o.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.269
Christy, I'd lend you

03:21.302 --> 03:23.904
my van, but it's all set up
for me to drive.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.906
Thanks.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.342
I'll figure something out.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.919
Watch it.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.488
Ow!
I'm sorry.

03:40.521 --> 03:41.789
I'm sorry,
I-I have to carry

03:41.822 --> 03:43.991
all my stuff in my bag;
my car broke down.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.025
No one cares!

03:52.933 --> 03:55.002
Oh, man. Come on, come
on, come on, come on.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.737
Nope.
What?

03:56.770 --> 03:59.340
The Warriors are down by two
with three minutes to go,

03:59.373 --> 04:03.043
and every time you come in
this room, Steph Curry misses.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.713
I got up to make you a sandwich.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.549
And the minute you left,
he nailed a three-pointer.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.385
You're insane.
Steph's open.
Take the shot!

04:11.419 --> 04:13.521
Oh, you're killing me!

04:15.523 --> 04:18.659
Do you know how many babies
throw up on the bus?

04:18.692 --> 04:20.428
All of them.

04:21.429 --> 04:22.996
They ought to change the song.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.798
* The babies on the bus
throw up, up, up. *

04:26.367 --> 04:28.336
Are you having dinner?

04:28.369 --> 04:31.372
Nope. I've got 15 minutes
to wash this day off of me,

04:31.405 --> 04:32.940
change my clothes,
and head out to Patrick's.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.676
It's a bus to a train to
another bus, but it's worth it.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.511
Is it? 'Cause you seem
a little stressed out.

04:37.545 --> 04:40.314
Really? You picking up
on that, Dr. Phil?

04:41.549 --> 04:43.717
And, by the way,
who goes,

04:43.751 --> 04:46.454
"Hey, I'm on a bus, time
to shave my calluses"?

04:46.487 --> 04:48.088
Wow. Hey.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.424
How about I give you
a ride to the station?

04:50.458 --> 04:52.693
Oh, man. How about you have this
conversation in the kitchen?

04:52.726 --> 04:54.428
'Cause he just
missed another shot.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.764
I'm sorry, Steph,
there's two of them now.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.767
Thanks, Mom.
That'd be great.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.935
TV ANNOUNCER:
...third foul of the night...

05:04.071 --> 05:06.374
You may stand near me;
it's a time-out.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.112
She looks awful.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.548
How long can she
keep going on like this?

05:14.582 --> 05:16.016
I don't know.
She's pretty tough.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.386
For one whole year,
she slept in a drawer.

05:18.419 --> 05:21.722
A lot of babies
sleep in drawers.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.491
No, she was 13.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.526
She fit in a drawer
when she was 13?

05:25.559 --> 05:27.861
She fits now.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.863
Listen,

05:29.897 --> 05:33.401
what if I lend Christy the money
for a down payment on a car?

05:33.434 --> 05:35.403
That is so kind of you,

05:35.436 --> 05:38.472
but if you do, I will punch you
right in the throat.

05:38.506 --> 05:39.973
Why?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.141
Because I love you.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.443
What?

05:42.476 --> 05:43.911
You lend her money,

05:43.944 --> 05:46.914
she can't pay you back,
she starts avoiding you,

05:46.947 --> 05:48.982
you start complaining to me,
I bring it up to her,

05:49.016 --> 05:51.385
she tells me to go to hell,
I get mad at you,

05:51.419 --> 05:53.387
you and I break up,
and I'm stuck with my backup guy

05:53.421 --> 05:55.789
at the tire department
at Costco.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.127
You have a backup guy?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.996
Please. Like you wouldn't drive
straight from my funeral

06:03.030 --> 06:05.833
to Trader Joe's
to pick up Louise.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.901
:
What?

06:07.935 --> 06:09.503
Is that her name?

06:09.537 --> 06:12.105
Oh, shut up.

06:12.139 --> 06:15.008
Nobody has that many questions
about cheese.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.513
:
* Sunshine, lollipops

06:19.547 --> 06:22.149
* And rainbows,
everything that's wonderful *

06:22.182 --> 06:24.151
* Is what I feel when

06:24.184 --> 06:26.820
* We're together,
brighter than a lucky... *

06:28.622 --> 06:30.491
You need some help with that?

06:30.524 --> 06:32.993
You need a mascara wand
in your eye?

06:43.804 --> 06:45.539
Oh, man.

06:45.573 --> 06:46.974
There you are.
Hi.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.009
I was so worried about you.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.645
I mean, I was texting you
for, like, three hours.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.814
Yeah. Sorry about that.
That's okay.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.883
Phone died, took a bus,
let's get it on.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.485
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.887
Why were you on a bus?
Ah, car died.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.222
Didn't change the oil.
Let's get it on.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.924
Oh, wait, wait. Hold on.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.193
Y-You took a bus all
the way down from Napa?

07:06.226 --> 07:08.896
And a train and another bus.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.198
Why are your pants still on?
Okay, I'm taking my pants off.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.100
Taking them off.
But hey, but, uh,

07:13.133 --> 07:15.035
tomorrow we are
getting you a car.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.705
I can't afford a car.
Well, mm...

07:17.738 --> 07:20.508
Well, that's why I said "we."
I'll lend you the money.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.142
No, no, no.
I appreciate it,

07:22.175 --> 07:24.244
but we're still at the "coffee
and fluffy robe" stage.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.079
Let's not ruin it.
No, no, no.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.648
I know you're
good for it.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.483
Uh, no, I'm not.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.919
Ah. Cute underwear.
Uh, thanks. Mm.

07:31.952 --> 07:35.088
They're my "I got me a
new girlfriend" underwear.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.557
Mm-hmm.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.230
What's the matter?

07:43.263 --> 07:46.500
Something sticky
in your hair.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.836
Oh, God,
that could be anything.

07:51.639 --> 07:54.608
I'm getting worried about
Christy missing meetings.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.677
Ooh. Was I supposed
to pick her up?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.178
Oh, well.

08:01.048 --> 08:03.016
Maybe we could
take up a collection

08:03.050 --> 08:04.718
and buy her a new car.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.587
Adam offered to float her
a down payment,

08:06.620 --> 08:08.756
but I said, "Never
lend money to a Plunkett."

08:08.789 --> 08:11.592
They should actually
put that on money.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.594
Riding the bus
isn't so bad.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.063
Except for that one time

08:16.096 --> 08:18.699
a guy leaned his head
on my shoulder and died.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.607
There was a time I
loved taking the bus.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.642
I used to strike up
a conversation

08:28.676 --> 08:30.310
with whoever sat
down next to me.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.912
Of course you did.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.786
MAN: Hey, lady.
You can't sleep here.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.220
What?

08:40.253 --> 08:41.589
What's going on?

08:41.622 --> 08:43.056
End of the line.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.592
Where am I?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.560
Stockton.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.762
Stockton?

08:48.796 --> 08:51.799
Where the hell is Stockton?

09:00.340 --> 09:02.810
Thank you so much
for picking me up.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.745
I know it was
a long drive.

09:04.778 --> 09:08.081
Yeah, two hours.

09:08.115 --> 09:11.719
Gonna be two hours
back, too, so...

09:11.752 --> 09:14.855
that's a total
of four hours.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.357
I am so sorry.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.226
Cheesy peanut butter cracker?

09:19.259 --> 09:21.094
Uh, sure.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.930
Vending machine dinner?

09:22.963 --> 09:25.866
I wish. I found 'em
on an empty seat.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.703
Open or closed?

09:29.737 --> 09:32.139
Closed. I'm not an animal.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.245
It's probably
not my place,

09:38.278 --> 09:40.047
and I don't mean to
offend you, but...

09:40.080 --> 09:41.782
I've been thinking,
how 'bout I loan you

09:41.815 --> 09:43.784
some money for a
down payment on a car?

09:43.817 --> 09:46.720
Great. Is there a dealership
open right now?

09:46.754 --> 09:50.223
Whoa. I had a whole thing
prepared to talk you into it.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.259
Well, waking up in Stockton

09:52.292 --> 09:54.294
smacked the pride
right out of me.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.898
But we have to
keep it on the DL,

09:57.931 --> 10:00.033
because Patrick offered me
a loan, and I said no.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.334
Yeah, let's keep it away
from your mom, too.

10:01.368 --> 10:02.970
She shot me down
when I brought this up

10:03.003 --> 10:04.104
a couple of weeks ago.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.239
What

10:06.273 --> 10:08.241
She said it was a bad idea
to loan money

10:08.275 --> 10:09.309
to anyone in your family.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.410
Oh, she's right.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.979
What you're doing is stupid,

10:12.012 --> 10:14.014
and two grand
should get it done.

10:17.685 --> 10:21.154
The kick is up...
oh, and it's good!

10:25.325 --> 10:26.794
Hey, Baxter?

10:26.827 --> 10:29.763
Oh, God, what did I do?

10:29.797 --> 10:32.265
Nothing.
I want to buy a car.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.002
Can you just tell me why you're
mad and skip the mind games?

10:35.035 --> 10:38.672
I'm not here as your ex.
I really do want to buy a car.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.941
You know, they cost money.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.110
And I have some.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.345
Well, then, come right in!

10:45.378 --> 10:47.347
Can I get you
a complimentary cappuccino?

10:47.380 --> 10:49.249
Hot chocolate

10:49.282 --> 10:52.319
They all come out of the same
machine; it's a miracle.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.356
Just the car, thanks.

10:56.389 --> 10:59.827
I want a new one
with buttons and seat heaters

10:59.860 --> 11:01.361
and a working turn signal.

11:01.394 --> 11:04.397
But it still has to be
really cheap, so I need a deal.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.766
Where'd you get the money?

11:07.067 --> 11:08.235
Oh, God.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.369
Christy, are you gambling again?

11:12.239 --> 11:15.408
And if so, who do you like
tonight, Sharks or Calgary?

11:15.442 --> 11:18.411
I'm not gambling,
and only idiots bet on hockey.

11:18.445 --> 11:21.882
Well, WNBA season
doesn't start for a while.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.854
Oh. I know
what's happening here.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.957
Your new little boyfriend
is underwriting this dream.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.491
Hey, that's offensive.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.927
I got the money
from my mom's boyfriend.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.732
My new guy offered,
and I said no.

11:38.766 --> 11:41.234
That is nothing to be proud of.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.236
Be like me.

11:43.270 --> 11:46.273
Find someone rich that
you don't hate, and kick back.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.942
You're still cute enough
to nab a sugar daddy.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.344
I should have gone to Nissan.

11:51.378 --> 11:55.015
Yeah, those are great cars.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.286
Face it, you and me,
we're arm candy.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.288
Got to use it
before you lose it.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.024
So you're saying I should
drain everything I can

12:04.057 --> 12:06.526
out of my boyfriend
before I become an old hag?

12:06.559 --> 12:09.329
Ticktock.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.036
I always heard about
this new-car smell.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.838
I never knew
it was real.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.840
Can you smell it?
I can.

12:19.873 --> 12:23.076
And?
Uh, definite upgrade.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.412
Yeah, I just couldn't get
that wet-dog smell

12:25.445 --> 12:26.847
out of my old car.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.081
Oh, yeah, you had a dog?

12:28.115 --> 12:30.483
Nope. Therein lies the mystery.

12:30.517 --> 12:33.253
Ooh, ooh, check this out.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.923
I don't have to
roll down the window

12:35.956 --> 12:37.490
and yell "honk
honk" anymore.

12:37.524 --> 12:38.458
That's great, babe.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.927
Where'd you get the money?

12:39.960 --> 12:42.229
My ex-husband sells cars,

12:42.262 --> 12:44.397
and he also loaned me
the down payment.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.366
Ooh, check this out.
Satellite radio.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.401
Do you want to hear the
Canadian comedy channel?

12:48.435 --> 12:51.839
H-Hold on. So, uh, you wouldn't
take money from me,

12:51.872 --> 12:54.174
but you took it
from your ex

12:54.207 --> 12:56.376
Yeah, because
that relationship's

12:56.409 --> 12:58.278
already burned down.

12:58.311 --> 13:02.182
Has it? I mean, what's this guy
doing loaning you money?

13:02.215 --> 13:04.952
He's just a good guy.
Well, I'm a good guy,

13:04.985 --> 13:08.588
but I don't write my ex
any checks I don't have to.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.191
So, does he want to
get back together with you?

13:11.224 --> 13:13.193
Oh, God, no.

13:13.226 --> 13:16.263
Trust me, we tried a couple
times; it did not work out.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.431
A couple of times?
Not recently.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.499
Ah. Well, when?

13:19.532 --> 13:21.969
Not since he
got engaged.

13:22.002 --> 13:25.105
Wait, not since
he got married.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.508
You know, this story's
not getting better.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.944
Okay, look,

13:30.978 --> 13:32.445
I promised I wouldn't
say anything,

13:32.479 --> 13:34.614
but I got the money
from your brother.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.449
What?

13:36.483 --> 13:39.486
Let's not make it a thing, okay?

13:39.519 --> 13:43.190
Yeah.
Of course not.

13:47.594 --> 13:51.031
Where do you get off
loaning my girlfriend money?

13:51.064 --> 13:52.499
You did what?!

13:52.532 --> 13:55.502
I thought it wasn't a thing!
Nice job keeping a secret!

13:55.535 --> 13:57.637
I had to tell him; he thought
I was sleeping with my ex.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.206
You're sleeping
with Baxter again?

13:59.239 --> 14:00.573
No!

14:01.574 --> 14:03.643
No!

14:03.676 --> 14:05.645
All right, we're
cleaning this up.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.647
How much did you loan her?
'Cause I'm giving it back

14:07.680 --> 14:09.582
to you right now
with interest.

14:09.616 --> 14:12.219
No, do not take his money.
Oh, I'm not taking his money.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.286
Well, somebody's
taking my money.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.522
We could use a new fridge.

14:15.555 --> 14:19.426
Consider it done.
Blank check, there you go.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.095
You lend my
girlfriend money,

14:22.129 --> 14:23.563
I lend your
girlfriend money.

14:23.596 --> 14:24.898
How's that feel?

14:24.932 --> 14:28.168
Great. Finally
my beer will be cold.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.171
Patrick, you cannot
give money to my mom.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.106
Especially a blank check.

14:33.140 --> 14:36.109
She'll have a black wig
and new fingerprints by sundown.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.579
Look, your woman had a problem,
I solved it.

14:39.612 --> 14:40.948
Don't get all threatened.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.582
His woman?
Screw you.

14:42.615 --> 14:43.984
Screw you!

14:44.017 --> 14:45.919
Screw both of you!

14:45.953 --> 14:48.922
Excuse... excuse me. I think
I need to sit down for a minute.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.657
You okay?
Yeah, it's just
everybody's fighting,

14:50.690 --> 14:52.292
and nobody's mad at me.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.962
I-I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.535
Hey, Baxter.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.171
Hey.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.538
Sorry to interrupt your lunch.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.074
Don't be.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.675
Candace made me
a kale and salmon wrap.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.910
She fooled me 'cause
it looked like a burrito.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.382
Thanks for taking the car back.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.384
I only put ten miles on it,

15:17.417 --> 15:20.587
but they were the happiest
ten miles of my life.

15:20.620 --> 15:25.625
Ugh. Good-bye,
sweet silver sedan.

15:25.658 --> 15:26.994
Take it.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.529
Rip the Band-Aid off.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.199
Christy, I'm not
taking the car back.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.201
Unbelievable.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.635
You promised.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.572
You are the most selfish,

15:39.606 --> 15:41.274
unreliable person
I've ever met,

15:41.308 --> 15:42.542
and that includes my mother.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.311
And why the hell
are you smiling?!

15:44.344 --> 15:47.214
'Cause you're gonna feel
so terrible in a second.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.615
What does that mean?

15:53.486 --> 15:55.655
I'm buying you the car.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.590
What?

15:57.624 --> 16:01.028
Look, we always focus on
the bad stuff you did to me,

16:01.061 --> 16:03.496
but I did a lot
of bad things to you.

16:04.597 --> 16:07.167
I would disappear
for days on end,

16:07.200 --> 16:10.170
I smoked your weed,
I slept with your friends.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.305
Friends?
I thought it was one.

16:12.339 --> 16:15.675
One friend six times,
six friends one time.

16:15.708 --> 16:19.412
The point is...

16:19.446 --> 16:21.714
over the years,
I've watched you

16:21.748 --> 16:24.051
make up for all the bad stuff
you did wrong,

16:24.084 --> 16:26.553
and I found it
really inspiring.

16:28.121 --> 16:32.392
So, this is me making
an amendment to you.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.327
It's actually called
an "amends."

16:34.361 --> 16:37.664
Dude, I'm giving you a free car.
Get off my ass.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.167
You're right. I'm sorry.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.169
But isn't Candace
going to be upset

16:42.202 --> 16:43.770
about you spending money on me?

16:43.803 --> 16:45.572
Eh, she'll never know.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.807
I had a secret
start-a-new-life fund,

16:47.840 --> 16:50.643
but then I realized,
who am I kidding?

16:50.677 --> 16:54.381
Money's turned me
into a house cat.

16:54.414 --> 16:57.084
Thank you, Baxter.
Oh...

16:57.117 --> 16:59.086
Oh.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.287
Wait.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.821
You're not doing this

17:01.854 --> 17:03.790
so you can sleep
with me, are you?

17:03.823 --> 17:07.494
Christy, I'm married.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.630
So only if you insist.

17:10.663 --> 17:11.731
I'm good.

17:11.764 --> 17:13.766
Cool, cool.

17:20.840 --> 17:23.643
You know, Baxter was
kind of a dick to me, too.

17:23.676 --> 17:26.413
You think I can get a car?

17:26.446 --> 17:28.348
Maybe you can get
an oil change,

17:28.381 --> 17:32.685
like the one I'm getting
in, uh, 2,981 miles.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.755
Whoa, whoa.
A granola bar?

17:35.788 --> 17:38.191
Why don't you just saw
a piece of wood in here?

17:38.225 --> 17:43.230
So I guess it's a no
on this incredibly ripe peach?

17:45.365 --> 17:48.135
How are you gonna tell
Patrick about the car?
Mm.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.670
I ran him by the dealership
to meet Baxter,

17:50.703 --> 17:53.606
who was hiding from his boss
in a large tire.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.175
Patrick's no longer threatened.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.076
Well played.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.746
Son of a bitch!

17:59.779 --> 18:01.681
Can I eat my peach now?
