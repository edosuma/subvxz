Tonight, in a well-balanced show,
James gets egg on his face,

00:15.282 --> 00:17.580
Richard runs himself over,

00:17.651 --> 00:21.280
and I power-slide
the new Aston Martin DBS.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.655
- (Applause)
- Yes, thank you.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.130
Thank you very much.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.325
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

00:33.401 --> 00:36.461
Hello. Hello and welcome to the show.

00:37.471 --> 00:42.067
Meanwhile,
next year sees the 40th anniversary

00:42.143 --> 00:44.441
of the formation of British Leyland,

00:44.512 --> 00:48.642
and we thought it would be a brilliant idea
to celebrate this automotive milestone,

00:48.716 --> 00:53.312
but unfortunately the producers of Top Gear
said there was nothing to celebrate,

00:53.387 --> 00:58.848
because BL was a miserable disaster
and everything they ever made was rubbish.

00:58.926 --> 01:02.089
And we said, well, yes, sure,
the cars weren't terribly well built,

01:02.163 --> 01:03.494
and quite a lot of bits fell off,

01:03.564 --> 01:07.762
but even so, we insisted
that some of the designs were quite clever.

01:07.835 --> 01:10.531
There was a really big argument,

01:10.604 --> 01:13.095
which ended up with the people in the office
saying to us,

01:13.174 --> 01:16.507
"If you think BL made a decent car,
you go out and buy one."

01:16.577 --> 01:20.035
They gave us each L1,200
of our own money...

01:20.114 --> 01:23.049
- (Laughter)
...and then set us a number of challenges.

01:23.117 --> 01:27.247
We were told to meet up
at the Warwick Services on the M40,

01:27.321 --> 01:29.448
and Jeremy was first to arrive.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.627
This is what I've bought.

01:37.698 --> 01:43.068
It's a Rover SD1 styled to look like
a Ferrari Daytona and it does.

01:43.137 --> 01:47.335
This particular model
has the 3.5 liter V8 engine,

01:47.408 --> 01:52.573
and inside you will find...
plum-colored vulgalour upholstery.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.843
It's got a stereo/radio cassette
that doesn't work,

01:55.916 --> 01:58.749
it's got cruise control... that doesn't work,

01:58.819 --> 02:02.380
an electric sunshine roof that...
doesn't work,

02:02.456 --> 02:07.291
er... but, as a result of these
small niggly little faults,

02:07.361 --> 02:12.890
I was able to get this bucket of magnificence
for just 1,100 of my pounds.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.701
The next contender arrived.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.603
Wait, there's a car arriving here
with no one behind the wheel.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.164
It must be Hammond
and it's a Dolly Sprint!

02:22.243 --> 02:25.644
- What d'you think?
- Yeah, look at that!

02:25.713 --> 02:29.615
First ever production car to have 16 valves,
four per cylinder.

02:29.683 --> 02:30.945
Wow!

02:31.018 --> 02:34.818
And the first British saloon car
to have alloy wheels as standard.

02:34.889 --> 02:37.050
- Wow!
- It's up there.

02:37.124 --> 02:39.456
Now, I seem to recall... Very sporty.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.154
- But, hang on, real wood.
- I know.

02:41.228 --> 02:44.720
The only thing is, they forgot to sand it.
You'll get splinters off it.

02:44.798 --> 02:48.393
It's made out of floorboards -
it's unbelievable!

02:48.469 --> 02:50.369
How much did you pay
of your own money?

02:50.437 --> 02:51.631
1,250ish.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.730
- So, you've gone over.
- It's a classic.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.037
It's desirable, people want these things.

02:56.110 --> 02:59.102
I talked Richard
through the Rover's little foibles.

02:59.180 --> 03:03.674
A little known fact about the Rover SD1
is that it was longer on one side,

03:03.751 --> 03:06.345
because it wasn't very well made,
than it was on the other.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.912
Engine, good.
Gearbox, good. Clutch, good.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.458
- These had central locking, electric windows.
- Mm-hm.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.256
- Didn't people used to get trapped and killed?
- Yeah.

03:15.329 --> 03:18.457
Your Dolly Sprint
was the hot hatchback of its day.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.056
- Very much so.
- So, what's May got?

03:24.471 --> 03:27.668
- Morning.
- And he's brought a piece of cheese.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.606
(Laughs)

03:29.677 --> 03:32.111
- You brought a Princess, James.
- I have.

03:32.179 --> 03:35.171
We're trying to prove British Leyland
occasionally made good cars.

03:35.249 --> 03:38.241
- You're not helping our case.
- Most interesting car they ever made.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.980
And most radical and most modern.

03:40.054 --> 03:43.023
Oh, look at the brown interior! Ooh!

03:43.090 --> 03:45.490
Brown, brown, brown.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.890
It's brown and browner.

03:46.961 --> 03:52.297
Brown was a '70s color. This is a 1978 car.
It's very interesting, it's in good condition...

03:52.366 --> 03:53.424
Why is it interesting?

03:53.500 --> 03:57.527
This was the first car in the world to obscure
its wiper spindles under the bonnet.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.870
Obscured windscreen wiper spindles -
there's a reason to own one.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.772
At the time it was important.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.367
What's the suspension in this?

04:04.445 --> 04:06.640
Hydragas. Very, very...

04:06.714 --> 04:09.342
- It's very low.
- No, that's how it should be.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.146
It's very low on that side and very high.

04:12.219 --> 04:14.813
- It's actually broken, James.
- It's leaked.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.822
This car, the Dolly Sprint,
was driven in the Professionals.

04:17.891 --> 04:23.557
This featured in the video of Don't You Want Me
Baby by the Human League.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.259
This was driven by Terry Scott
in Terry And June.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.459
- I know.
- Enough said.

04:29.403 --> 04:32.895
Now, at this point,
we'd normally receive our challenge,

04:32.973 --> 04:37.967
but spitefully, the production team said
we had to drive 40 miles to go and get it.

04:40.447 --> 04:43.348
40 miles? No problem at all.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.146
To horse.

04:45.219 --> 04:46.914
Come on!

04:46.987 --> 04:48.318
Yeah!

04:49.757 --> 04:50.883
Oh, God!

04:53.160 --> 04:55.651
(Engine won't start)

05:01.468 --> 05:02.765
Erm...

05:07.408 --> 05:09.376
The key won't turn in my ignition.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.967
Mine doesn't start at all.

05:11.045 --> 05:12.910
Hang on, James.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.380
Which slovenly Midlander built this?

05:16.417 --> 05:18.078
The steering lock's gone on.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.143
God!

05:24.625 --> 05:26.684
I like it here.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.695
- It's a shame to move from this glorious spot.
- It's a lovely morning.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.231
I'm just letting my engine breathe,
get some air.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.995
(Richard) Eventually the Rover
screeched into life.

05:35.069 --> 05:37.435
(Fan belt squealing)

05:39.740 --> 05:43.437
I got my Dolly going as well,
and we were on our way.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.571
Now, for our younger viewers,

05:47.648 --> 05:52.347
we should explain why the Top Gear office
thinks the three of us have lost our marbles.

05:52.419 --> 05:56.048
You see,
some BL cars were quite badly built...

05:57.758 --> 05:59.453
...but most weren't built at all.

06:00.494 --> 06:05.158
This is because the workforce
spent most of its time outside on strike.

06:05.232 --> 06:10.568
But still, we say that despite all this,
some good cars did sneak through the net,

06:10.637 --> 06:12.662
and we were going to prove it.

06:13.741 --> 06:18.769
I was full of hope, right up to the end
of the slip road leaving Warwick Services.

06:18.846 --> 06:21.679
My throttle's broken.
My throttle's broken.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.307
Oh, God.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.352
Hammond's in trouble already.

06:25.419 --> 06:28.411
I got a hundred yards and it's broken.

06:28.489 --> 06:31.822
I can't make the...
The throttle doesn't work.

06:34.995 --> 06:39.432
In the lopsided Princess,
James was unaware of my demise.

06:39.500 --> 06:43.527
I think British cars of the 1970s were good.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.266
We had this, we had Jeremy's Rover,
great car.

06:46.340 --> 06:48.570
The Dolomite Sprint that Hammond's got,
great car.

06:53.247 --> 06:56.216
They've given us these little cameras
to film our various calamities.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.478
We were expecting car problems
and we've got them,

06:58.552 --> 07:01.112
but there's another one here -
Jeremy's finger.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.748
I was just seeing what was in here.

07:10.297 --> 07:11.958
Has anyone got any butter?

07:13.100 --> 07:18.834
With some AA wire and some AA Lurpak,
Jeremy and I were soon on our way.

07:22.376 --> 07:24.003
Yeah!

07:24.077 --> 07:26.545
And quickly we caught up with James,

07:26.613 --> 07:30.014
so we could reflect
on the brilliance of our cars.

07:30.083 --> 07:33.052
Some great details on this thing,
like the seat belt warning light,

07:33.120 --> 07:35.850
which flashes if you sit in the seat
but don't put the seat belt on.

07:35.923 --> 07:40.883
That sounds perfectly everyday now,
but back then, that was radical,

07:40.961 --> 07:43.521
and annoying,
because seat belts weren't compulsory.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.794
It's almost as though this car
was designed by futurologists.

07:51.872 --> 07:56.571
I mean, this little slot down here
is the exact size of a mobile phone.

07:56.643 --> 08:01.774
Tomorrow's World never even saw the
mobile phone coming and yet Rover did.

08:01.849 --> 08:05.580
And here, look, the door mirrors
are operated by this switch, OK?

08:05.652 --> 08:08.712
Now, the people who put that switch there
knew it would break,

08:08.789 --> 08:11.758
so they put manual controls in as well.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.824
Here comes Hammond,
he's coming through.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.792
Yeah!

08:18.765 --> 08:23.225
(Laughs)
The noise it's making is Biblical!

08:23.303 --> 08:27.763
I shall now engage my fully-functioning
overdrive by pressing this button.

08:29.776 --> 08:31.073
Nothing's happened.

08:34.448 --> 08:39.578
To get our first challenge, we'd been told
to go to the old Morris factory in 0xford.

08:39.653 --> 08:44.249
Unfortunately, when we got there,
we found the plant now belongs to BMW...

08:45.826 --> 08:47.623
...who told us to go away.

08:52.399 --> 08:56.460
So we were sent instead
to the old Triumph factory in Canley,

08:56.537 --> 09:00.473
but when we got there, we discovered
it had been turned into a hotel.

09:02.442 --> 09:07.402
The only evidence of its existence
was a few forlorn road names.

09:09.383 --> 09:13.615
So, we were told to go to
the old Austin factory in Longbridge.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.024
Sadly, though, it had gone.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.732
There's nothing...
There's nothing left.

09:28.468 --> 09:31.995
I'd heard the Chinese had bought Longbridge.
I didn't know they bought all of it.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.403
Everything.

09:33.473 --> 09:34.599
How's your car holding up?

09:34.675 --> 09:37.007
I've got some odd squeaks and rattles.

09:37.077 --> 09:43.107
I could actually make a fairly good drum solo
out of various bits of trim in my car.

09:43.183 --> 09:46.277
We decided to compare noises.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.344
(Banging, rattling and squeaking)

09:52.125 --> 09:53.319
And before you knew it...

09:53.393 --> 09:55.384
(Banging, squeaking and rattling)

09:57.000 --> 10:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:12.913 --> 10:17.748
A requiem to Longbridge
from the Top Gear British Leyland Trio.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.583
That's got a certain something.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.422
It was time to move on.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.086
(Laughs)

10:33.200 --> 10:34.497
You opened the door wide.

10:34.568 --> 10:37.401
I opened the door... The door's still there!

10:37.471 --> 10:40.167
(All laugh)

10:40.240 --> 10:43.937
- It's come back to Longbridge.
- It's on strike.

10:46.113 --> 10:49.776
Finally, I got past my stable door
and we were off.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.217
Well... one of us was.

10:53.286 --> 10:56.278
(Engines turn but don't start)

11:00.627 --> 11:02.788
(Applause)

11:02.863 --> 11:04.160
That did happen, that.

11:04.231 --> 11:09.134
Yes, but that door, how it got stuck,
I have no idea.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.199
I've opened one door,
now I'll open another.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.208
Meanwhile, we did eventually
get our cars started

11:16.276 --> 11:19.905
and we made our way to where they set us
some challenges. More of that later on.

11:20.714 --> 11:24.150
But now it's time to do the news and...
Oh, God, there's a lot to get through.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.310
We've got the Ferrari 430 Scuderia.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.686
I've driven this now.
It's absolutely fantastic.

11:29.756 --> 11:33.214
Unfortunately, we won't be able to show it
to you because some idiot's crashed it.

11:33.293 --> 11:36.751
Supposed to be filming it later this week,
but that's not gonna happen.

11:36.830 --> 11:41.858
Nissan, this is the GTR - this is gonna be
the most exciting car of 2008.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.698
We've just heard this week it goes round...

11:43.770 --> 11:45.260
- Is it the Nurburgring?
- It is.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.330
It goes round the Nurburgring
quicker than a 911 Turbo.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.171
- Wow!
- Can't wait for that.

11:50.243 --> 11:54.077
Then of course, we've got the battle between
the Subaru Impreza, the new one,

11:54.147 --> 11:56.877
and the Mitsubishi Evo 10.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.781
So much good stuff!

11:58.852 --> 12:01.150
- Hammond, what have you got?
- News from Korea.

12:01.221 --> 12:05.214
The Kia Picanto,
it's got a new front bumper.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.089
- Look at that.
- Wow!

12:07.160 --> 12:08.422
Is that it?

12:08.495 --> 12:10.793
- Yeah, just the bumper.
- Anything else?

12:10.864 --> 12:13.833
Well, more news from Korea, actually.
You know the Hyundai CoupÃ©?

12:13.900 --> 12:16.664
- Yes.
- Well, there's a new one coming.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.705
Look. That looks brilliant.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.798
The trouble with the Hyundai CoupÃ©
is that it always looks quite good

12:21.875 --> 12:25.902
it's quite nice to drive and it's front-wheel drive
and a bit sort of half-arsed, I always think.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.971
Well, this time they're talking about
putting a V8 in the front of that.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.745
As it is, there's a V6, 300 brake horsepower,
it's a light engine,

12:31.818 --> 12:33.843
or you can have a four-pot turbo.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.445
- It is rear-wheel drive this time.
- It's rear drive?

12:36.523 --> 12:39.686
Yeah, and limited slip diff.
They're looking to take on the Mustang with it.

12:39.760 --> 12:42.354
Even I like that.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.727
- They'll be delighted.
- No, I do.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.356
So, what news have you got, James?

12:46.433 --> 12:49.334
Well, actually,
I've got some news from Korea.

12:49.402 --> 12:52.371
You can't tell, can you, that Top Gear's
just been sold in Korea?

12:52.439 --> 12:53.497
(Laughter)

12:53.573 --> 12:56.599
I think we're smoothing this one out nicely.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.007
It's not showing.

12:58.078 --> 13:01.445
- Hello, you industrious little fellows.
- (Laughter)

13:02.849 --> 13:04.476
That's got 'em on-side, well done.

13:04.551 --> 13:08.647
From Korea, you know the Kia Cee'd?

13:08.722 --> 13:11.020
- Yes, what about it?
- Cee'd.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.855
Well, it's the fourth best car of the year.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.622
Fourth best?

13:15.695 --> 13:17.356
It's the fourth best car of the year.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.091
That's not even a podium finish, is it?

13:19.166 --> 13:20.565
What beat it?

13:20.634 --> 13:22.795
- The Fiat 500 was the winner.
- Mm-hm.

13:22.869 --> 13:26.361
Third place was the Ford Mondeo.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.634
And then fourth place, the Cee'd.

13:28.708 --> 13:33.475
Then in fifth place was the Nissan...
Cuscus?

13:33.547 --> 13:35.242
Squishsquash.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.441
Where's the Audi R8?

13:37.684 --> 13:38.651
It's not here.

13:38.718 --> 13:46.682
Who here... would have a Nissan Kumquat
in front of an R8?

13:46.760 --> 13:48.057
It's a survey.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.493
(Laughter)

13:49.563 --> 13:53.021
That's 0% of British people
would do that.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.124
What idiots have come up with that?

13:55.202 --> 13:57.170
Well, you see, it's the Car of the Year jury.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.535
It's senior people from 22 countries,

13:59.606 --> 14:03.474
and they have a sort of pathological hatred
of any car that's expensive.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.942
They're just communists.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.638
The interesting thing is, you see,

14:06.713 --> 14:10.046
a couple of weeks ago, remember I drove
that Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead?

14:10.116 --> 14:12.084
- Mm-hm.
- I dunno,

14:12.152 --> 14:14.620
- I thought that was better than the Fiat.
- (Laughter)

14:14.688 --> 14:17.248
- I think it could be, yeah.
- More news.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.621
You know the Hyundai Sonata?

14:18.692 --> 14:20.057
- Oh, Hyundai.
- Korean car.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.356
- Mm.
- New front bumper, here it is.

14:22.429 --> 14:26.422
New headlamps, new dashboard,
new radiator grille

14:26.499 --> 14:28.626
- and I wouldn't have one.
- Me neither.

14:28.702 --> 14:33.571
Honestly, things I'd rather do
than drive one of those include

14:33.640 --> 14:37.576
presenting next week's show
while gently cupping James' scrotum.

14:37.644 --> 14:38.906
(Laughter)

14:38.979 --> 14:42.471
And we're... We're off the air in Korea.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.143
Goodbye, industrious little fellows. Erm...

14:45.218 --> 14:48.381
Oh, give me a minute, I'm gonna have trouble
shifting that vision now.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.753
- (Laughter)
- You're gonna have trouble?

14:50.824 --> 14:53.987
We've also been sold, you'll like this,
we've been sold in Australia.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.620
We have, so we should probably talk
about Australian cars.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.493
- Is there an Australian here?
- (Man) Yeah!

14:58.565 --> 15:01.261
- Yeah.
- We're now yours.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.665
Yeah, you've bought us.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.637
And so
we must talk about an Australian car.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.195
(Richard) Yeah, er, yeah.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.935
The XR8, that's Australian.

15:09.009 --> 15:12.638
It isn't. It's got an American engine
and it was engineered by a Scotch.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.407
- You're right.
- So, what else is there?

15:15.315 --> 15:16.646
- Erm...
- There's...

15:18.251 --> 15:20.276
- (Laughter)
- Erm...

15:20.353 --> 15:21.752
Wasn't? No.

15:22.789 --> 15:24.654
What Australian cars are there?

15:24.724 --> 15:27.659
- Falcon!
- That's a Ford, you blithering idiot,

15:27.727 --> 15:29.752
- that's American.
- (Laughter)

15:29.829 --> 15:32.730
What did you say - you're no good at rugby
and we've beaten you twice?

15:32.799 --> 15:34.027
(Laughter)

15:34.100 --> 15:35.692
(Applause)

15:35.769 --> 15:37.396
That's what I heard.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.994
Yeah.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.004
I think...

15:43.043 --> 15:44.840
...we'll move on.

15:44.911 --> 15:49.644
Now, have you ever wanted
to buy a sports car that's got a diesel engine,

15:49.716 --> 15:52.378
top speed of 150 miles an hour,

15:52.452 --> 15:58.413
that's a high-riding 4x4 off-road car,
and is also a four-seater convertible?

15:58.491 --> 16:00.584
- (Both) No.
- Neither have I,

16:00.660 --> 16:02.719
but Audi's made one anyway.
Here it is.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.230
(Richard) What do you do with it?

16:05.298 --> 16:07.129
- (Laughter)
- I've no idea.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.533
It's called the Cross Cabriolet.
Not as cross as the owner will be

16:10.603 --> 16:13.697
when he buys it and discovers
he looks like Graham Norton's plumber.

16:13.773 --> 16:14.740
(Laughter)

16:14.808 --> 16:18.209
But, the thing is,
it's only a concept at the moment.

16:18.278 --> 16:21.509
The trouble is, Audi have a habit
of putting their concepts into production,

16:21.581 --> 16:23.014
but really, just no with that one.

16:23.083 --> 16:28.885
You know the Morgan Aero 8, which was
the first car ever made with cross eyes?

16:28.955 --> 16:30.388
We've got a picture of it here.

16:30.457 --> 16:34.257
There you are. I called it Clarence
from the old Daktari programs.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.819
Anyway, Morgan has now fixed
the sort of squint.

16:37.897 --> 16:41.594
The problem is, that they've decided
that while they were at it,

16:41.668 --> 16:45.866
they would make a coupÃ© version of the Aero 8
and it's called the Aero Max.

16:45.939 --> 16:47.668
We've got a picture of that.

16:47.741 --> 16:50.005
Now, I'm sorry,
d'you know how much that is?

16:50.076 --> 16:53.534
L110,000.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.776
You would have to be so mad
to buy one of those,

16:56.850 --> 16:59.410
that you wouldn't be able to have
a driving license.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.351
You know who's ordered one, don't you?

17:01.421 --> 17:02.911
Ray Charles? Stevie Wonder? Who?

17:02.989 --> 17:04.819
(Laughter)

17:04.891 --> 17:06.858
- Who?
- Him.

17:06.925 --> 17:08.894
Yes, I have.

17:08.962 --> 17:11.453
- Thanks for that.
- You've ordered one of those?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.726
- Yes, I have.
- Why?

17:13.800 --> 17:15.961
Because it's brilliant.

17:16.036 --> 17:19.493
It's like saying "Well, you know,
I've had marriage proposals this week

17:19.571 --> 17:22.803
"from Keira Knightley and Natalie Portman
and Angelina Jolie,

17:22.876 --> 17:25.503
"but I've decided
I'm gonna marry John McCririck."

17:25.578 --> 17:27.512
(Laughter)

17:27.579 --> 17:30.014
Very funny and everything,
but you're wrong.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.278
That is the last
of the proper British sports cars.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.877
- It's got a German engine.
- Yes, but the rest of it...

17:34.954 --> 17:37.650
- And it looks like an insect.
- You drive a Spyder.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.784
- Technically, a spider isn't an insect.
- Oh, shut up, James.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.418
(Laughter)

17:42.495 --> 17:44.463
You've got a Panda, you know nothing.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.055
- Can I say something here?
- What?

17:46.132 --> 17:48.657
- I'm with Hammond.
- What, you like that?

17:48.735 --> 17:51.226
- I think it's terrific.
- When you said "I'm with Hammond"

17:51.304 --> 17:53.704
- I thought you meant we were going out.
- (Laughter)

17:55.075 --> 17:58.943
I would like to apologise to the nation
and to the world, what's left of it,

17:59.012 --> 18:02.311
erm, what's left that's watching,
for the level of blind idiocy this week,

18:02.782 --> 18:04.716
and now I'm going to move it on.

18:05.518 --> 18:08.715
It's time for me to try
a new Aston Martin out on our track.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.517
There are two reasons I want to do that -

18:10.590 --> 18:12.353
one, it's a new Aston Martin,

18:12.425 --> 18:16.225
and two, I couldn't work out what it's for.

18:24.137 --> 18:27.766
It's called the DBS
and Aston Martin are very adamant

18:27.841 --> 18:32.175
that it's an all-new six liter, hard-driving
lightweight thoroughbred.

18:32.912 --> 18:39.249
I'm not sure about that. To my mind,
a thoroughbred car is Italian and flamboyant

18:39.319 --> 18:42.049
and it has its engine in the middle
and it goes wrong all the time.

18:43.356 --> 18:46.382
This is... none of those things.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.823
Yes, it has four nostrils in the bonnet,

18:53.900 --> 18:57.700
carbon fiber buttocks
and carbon ceramic brakes.

18:57.770 --> 19:02.707
But the engine's at the front,
there's lots of storage space in the cabin,

19:02.775 --> 19:05.266
and it has a boot you can actually use.

19:06.412 --> 19:11.873
It therefore isn't laid out like a thoroughbred,
but who knows, maybe it'll drive like one.

19:14.754 --> 19:19.282
OK, I'm gonna tell the adaptive suspension
that I'm on a track. There we are.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.119
And here we go.

19:34.407 --> 19:35.874
I like the steering.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.172
I do like that and I like the brakes.

19:39.946 --> 19:43.905
And I have to say, I'm also pretty fond
of the tweaked differential they've put in,

19:43.983 --> 19:45.917
which means you can do this.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.145
Yeah, look at that!

19:49.656 --> 19:55.026
I must say, the tires, which are specially
made just for this car, by Pirelli, are brilliant.

19:55.094 --> 19:56.925
Very good, excellent.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.230
Wey-hey!

20:01.301 --> 20:03.565
It makes the right noises as well.

20:07.874 --> 20:11.469
But, you don't get that same sense of terror

20:11.544 --> 20:15.241
that you get from a proper thoroughbred,
like, say a Ferrari.

20:18.751 --> 20:23.120
None of that sense of
"Oh, my God, I've wet myself!"

20:29.162 --> 20:31.357
There's something else as well.

20:31.431 --> 20:34.195
Hard, really, to put my finger on,
but it feels...

20:34.934 --> 20:36.993
Dunno, it just feels a little bit...

20:38.538 --> 20:39.698
...old-fashioned.

20:41.674 --> 20:45.633
Maybe old-fashioned is unkind.
Maybe old school would be better,

20:45.712 --> 20:48.977
but either way, it's not a thoroughbred.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.153
Perhaps then, it's a work of art.

20:58.625 --> 21:02.425
There's no denying that it's
bite-the-back-of-your-hand beautiful.

21:04.530 --> 21:07.294
But is it better looking than a DB9?

21:07.367 --> 21:10.359
Well, apart from the racing paraphernalia
on the DBS,

21:10.436 --> 21:12.734
they look pretty much the same to me.

21:14.007 --> 21:15.941
Keira Knightley...

21:16.009 --> 21:19.172
Keira Knightley in Puff Diddly's jewelry.

21:19.245 --> 21:22.737
And it's all very well them saying
the DBS is carbon fiber,

21:22.815 --> 21:25.215
it's only ten stone lighter than the DB9,

21:25.285 --> 21:29.483
and that's what,
the weight of a medium sized... woman.

21:32.592 --> 21:37.586
So, it's not a thoroughbred supercar
and it's not as good-looking as its sister.

21:37.664 --> 21:41.896
Maybe then, we should view it
as a replacement for the old Vanquish S.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.465
The trouble with doing that though,

21:45.538 --> 21:49.975
is that the DBS's V12 produces
510 brake horsepower,

21:50.043 --> 21:54.070
and that's ten less than you got
from the Vanquish's V12.

21:55.515 --> 21:56.982
(Engines revving)

21:57.050 --> 21:58.574
(Tires squealing)

22:03.122 --> 22:07.218
As a result, the Vanquish will do 200 mph.

22:07.293 --> 22:11.627
This is out of puff at 191.
Come on!

22:12.899 --> 22:14.799
There are other problems too.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.928
The interior is all marvelous -

22:20.006 --> 22:23.134
an amazing blend of carbon fiber, suede,

22:23.209 --> 22:26.736
and lots of exciting buttons
you can't see or reach.

22:27.847 --> 22:32.614
I especially love the gear lever
which is like a Power Ranger's leg.

22:33.386 --> 22:37.584
And then they go and let the whole thing down
with this stupid key.

22:37.657 --> 22:41.718
They call it, and I'm not joking,
an emotional control unit.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.284
Got one of those already.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.888
It's called a government
and I don't like that either.

22:52.238 --> 22:55.503
This car then, is shaping up
to be a bit of a misfit.

22:58.344 --> 23:02.872
But don't worry, because
there's one thing it does brilliantly.

23:04.517 --> 23:09.216
Put it back in road mode and it becomes
a stunning long-distance cruiser -

23:09.288 --> 23:11.779
an epic grand tourer.

23:15.661 --> 23:19.290
I'd be happy to drive this
all the way to the south of France,

23:19.365 --> 23:23.131
and I'd be happy if I got there and found
I'd forgotten my swimming trunks,

23:23.202 --> 23:26.330
because then I could drive it all
the way back again.

23:29.008 --> 23:32.910
When you're on a motorway,
it's smooth and civilized. Quiet as well.

23:32.979 --> 23:34.970
It is magnificent.

23:41.354 --> 23:43.549
But even here, there's a problem.

23:43.623 --> 23:47.855
Because if you want a good-looking
and fast long-distance cruiser,

23:47.927 --> 23:51.294
what exactly is the matter with the DB9?

23:52.131 --> 23:55.862
It's easier to use, has the same engine,
has two more seats,

23:55.935 --> 23:59.496
and it costs L50,000 less.

24:03.576 --> 24:05.874
(Applause)

24:14.854 --> 24:16.378
Yeah, but it's no good then?

24:16.456 --> 24:22.019
Oh, no, this is the best car I've driven all year
and by a huge margin.

24:22.094 --> 24:25.586
Hang on, you just said it's not at quick
as a Vanquish,

24:25.665 --> 24:27.098
and it's not as pretty as a DB9.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.760
And it's L50,000 more.

24:29.836 --> 24:32.168
Yeah, the thing is, Aston Martin messed up.

24:32.238 --> 24:35.833
When they said it's a thoroughbred,
it's an all-new car, it isn't.

24:35.908 --> 24:40.242
That's what threw me. It's taken me ages
to work it out but what this is,

24:40.313 --> 24:45.615
is a DB9 where every little piece
is a little bit better.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.516
I tell you what, this is the way to think of it -

24:47.587 --> 24:52.615
don't think of it as a DBS,
think of it as a DB9S,

24:52.692 --> 24:55.820
like a DB9 Evo, and then it makes sense.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.157
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:57.230 --> 25:00.028
- L50,000?
- I agree,

25:00.099 --> 25:04.035
the price is a bit steep.
It's perilously close to the Ferrari 599,

25:04.103 --> 25:07.664
but honestly, you cannot buy a DB9 any more,
you just can't do it,

25:07.740 --> 25:10.436
because one day,
you will be sitting at a set of lights,

25:10.510 --> 25:12.978
someone will pull up alongside
in one of these,

25:13.045 --> 25:16.572
and you will feel hopeless and inadequate
and you will have to kill yourself.

25:16.649 --> 25:17.775
(Laughter)

25:17.850 --> 25:21.513
Anyway, it is now time to see how fast
this goes round our track,

25:21.587 --> 25:24.522
and that of course means handing it over
to our tame racing driver.

25:24.590 --> 25:30.756
Some say that he knows two facts
about ducks and both of them are wrong.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.320
(Laughter)

25:34.534 --> 25:36.502
And, that 61 years ago,

25:36.569 --> 25:42.804
he accidentally introduced her majesty
the Queen to a Greek racialist.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.206
(Laughter)

25:44.277 --> 25:48.805
All we know is, I'm going to the Tower now
to have my head cut off,

25:48.881 --> 25:51.372
erm, and he is called The Stig.

25:52.718 --> 25:56.051
And he's off,
with a wheel spin and a V12 bellow.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.783
Thundering down to the first corner.

25:57.857 --> 26:00.621
It's wet out there today.
Let's see how that affects things.

26:00.693 --> 26:04.629
Carving a pretty steady path through there,
no problems so far.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.426
Brilliantl

26:07.066 --> 26:10.797
(Man) What is my purpose?
What would I want to accomplish?

26:10.870 --> 26:12.861
What values do I want to live by?

26:12.939 --> 26:17.103
(Jeremy) Staying on his self-help odyssey
there as he kicks the tail out.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.768
Whoa, really kicking the tail outl

26:18.844 --> 26:23.907
In every way, this car's better than the DB9
including those superb new tires.

26:23.983 --> 26:26.144
They might be struggling with the damp,
mind you.

26:26.218 --> 26:29.915
Looking pretty planted round Hammerhead
and then, whoa, look at thatl

26:29.989 --> 26:33.288
(Man) What wall do I want
to put my ladder of life against?

26:33.359 --> 26:36.692
(Jeremy) Keeping it pinned open through
the Follow-through. Does he lift-off?

26:36.762 --> 26:41.699
Yes, then back on the loud pedal.
Down now to the last two corners.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.964
Magnificent brakes, better diff,
all doing their stuff.

26:45.037 --> 26:47.198
A normal DB9 would be nowhere now.

26:47.273 --> 26:51.175
Here he comes, slices through Gambon
and across the line.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.108
- (Applause)
- Yeah!

26:53.179 --> 26:55.511
Now...

26:56.716 --> 27:03.986
Now, it did it on a wet track
in one minute 27.4,

27:04.056 --> 27:07.423
which is sort of here,
in the middle of nowhere.

27:07.493 --> 27:11.156
Thing is though, the track dried out
just before we came on air,

27:11.230 --> 27:14.256
so I said to Tthe Stig "Quickly go out,
do it again, get a time.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.267
"Let's see how good this thing really is."

27:16.335 --> 27:20.169
One minute, 23.9.

27:20.239 --> 27:23.572
It's up here, it's with Koenigseggs
and the Zonda.

27:23.643 --> 27:26.373
It's the same time as the Zonda.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.606
I mean, that is just staggering. Brilliant.

36:27.383 --> 36:33.811
Meanwhile, earlier on, the three of us
each spent L1,200 of our own money,

36:33.889 --> 36:35.413
on three BL cars,

36:35.491 --> 36:40.053
in a bid to show that the old British
warhorse did occasionally get something right.

36:40.129 --> 36:42.461
Yes, and the producers of the show

36:42.531 --> 36:45.762
were keen to demonstrate
that they never got anything right at all,

36:45.835 --> 36:49.293
so they came up
with a series of challenges.

36:49.372 --> 36:51.169
Yeah, and for every one we passed,

36:51.240 --> 36:53.708
we'd win money back
towards the cost of the car.

36:53.776 --> 36:58.213
Yes, so full of enthusiasm,
we were sent to the MIRA Test Track -

36:58.280 --> 37:02.011
top secret place - it's where the motor industry
tests all its secret new models.

37:02.084 --> 37:06.180
It's just outside Nuneaton, on the A5,
between Hinckley and Atherstone...

37:07.223 --> 37:08.656
...just before the A444.

37:08.724 --> 37:11.818
If you get to Fenny Drayton,
you've gone too far, you need to back up.

37:11.894 --> 37:12.986
(Laughter)

37:15.064 --> 37:18.329
This is it, an automotive torture chamber.

37:18.401 --> 37:21.063
An endless series of twists,
bumps and corners,

37:21.137 --> 37:24.334
designed to find weaknesses in cars.

37:25.374 --> 37:29.105
We would begin with timed laps
on the handling circuit.

37:30.346 --> 37:36.182
And to spice things up, we'd have to beat
a time set by The Stig in a Datsun 120Y.

37:37.253 --> 37:40.279
This was the little Japanese car
that showed our dads

37:40.356 --> 37:45.316
they didn't have to have a flaky Austin 1100
that broke down all the time.

37:50.299 --> 37:53.427
1,171cc four-cylinder engine.

37:53.502 --> 37:55.231
- How many BHP is it?
- 69.

37:55.304 --> 37:57.397
- Wow!
- 69 horsepowers!

37:58.607 --> 38:03.670
Every single cold morning,
Britain echoed to the sound of "eh-eh-eh"

38:03.746 --> 38:05.839
as nobody's car started,
then along came that,

38:05.915 --> 38:08.349
which showed the world
cars could be reliable.

38:08.417 --> 38:10.942
- Yes, but reliability is so tedious.
- It's boring.

38:11.020 --> 38:14.114
Here he comes now.
He's coming up to the triple right here.

38:14.190 --> 38:16.124
Ooh, he's locked up, terrible brakes.

38:17.126 --> 38:19.651
- And across the line in?
- One minute eleven.

38:19.728 --> 38:21.958
- One minute eleven seconds?
- Yes.

38:22.031 --> 38:25.489
With nearly twice the horsepower
of the Datsun,

38:25.568 --> 38:30.062
naught to sixty in 8.7 seconds
and double wishbone suspension,

38:30.139 --> 38:32.664
I would destroy the Datsun's time.

38:34.410 --> 38:35.468
Go.

38:37.246 --> 38:41.444
My washing machine
moves around the kitchen faster than that.

38:41.517 --> 38:43.712
(Richard) Come on, little fella.

38:43.786 --> 38:47.950
Richard, it's for you, it's for Triumph,
it's for British Leyland, it's for Britain!

38:51.126 --> 38:52.889
- Hairpin, hairpin.
- Here we go.

38:52.962 --> 38:55.453
This is where the sophisticated suspension
will help him.

38:58.501 --> 38:59.468
Will not help help him.

39:02.037 --> 39:03.004
Smooth!

39:04.874 --> 39:07.035
That's the slowest I've ever seen a car move.

39:08.010 --> 39:11.673
0n the plus side, the cornering
did give my electrics a good shake.

39:11.747 --> 39:13.715
(Radio static)

39:13.782 --> 39:15.477
Every now and again,
the radio comes on.

39:16.519 --> 39:18.544
That's my radio.

39:18.621 --> 39:20.555
0ne minute eleven to beat.

39:20.623 --> 39:23.183
Yeah! I think we did well.

39:23.259 --> 39:24.783
Jesus!

39:26.562 --> 39:29.429
- (Laughs) Yeah, fifty-eight seconds.
- Yeah, yeah, brilliant.

39:29.498 --> 39:34.663
If you're watching this in Japan, there you go,
you see, you're not so clever. Eh-heh!

39:34.737 --> 39:36.534
- What was it really?
- One sixteen.

39:36.605 --> 39:37.572
Oh, God.

39:37.640 --> 39:39.039
(Claps) Nice one.

39:40.509 --> 39:42.170
- Well done.
- Yeah!

39:42.244 --> 39:44.212
- Well done. Excellent.
- It felt good.

39:45.247 --> 39:48.114
Now, let's see if we can give the Datsun
another thrashing,

39:48.183 --> 39:51.118
with some Rover V8 muscle.

39:51.186 --> 39:54.087
No need to worry about traction control -
doesn't have it.

39:55.424 --> 39:59.155
Ohh, that was a wheel spin!

39:59.228 --> 40:00.627
That's not fast.

40:00.696 --> 40:07.864
3,500cc developing an astonishing
155 brake horsepower.

40:08.837 --> 40:11.305
Oh, yes, feel the grip!

40:13.008 --> 40:16.273
That wasn't a sophisticated car,
despite looking modern, was it?

40:16.345 --> 40:19.473
Oh, not at all, no.
The suspension was from the 1950s.

40:19.548 --> 40:22.244
- And it's not a sophisticated man driving it.
- Yes!

40:22.318 --> 40:25.583
(Tires squealing)

40:25.654 --> 40:28.418
Ohh, what was that?

40:28.490 --> 40:31.687
- A lot of grass. A lot of grass.
- It was off-road.

40:33.429 --> 40:36.125
It does sound good, though.
Well, no, it sounds terrible.

40:36.198 --> 40:38.291
(JJerekmy) Crossing the line!

40:40.235 --> 40:42.260
Unfortunately...

40:42.338 --> 40:43.930
Got smoke.

40:44.006 --> 40:47.965
...some oil had come out
and was sort of on fire, but no matter.

40:48.043 --> 40:49.067
Ah!

40:49.144 --> 40:50.304
(Richard) Your time.

40:50.379 --> 40:52.904
Yes, my time.
One minute eleven for that.

40:52.982 --> 40:54.540
Yes, and...

40:54.617 --> 40:56.915
- What?
- One minute twelve. It was.

40:56.986 --> 40:58.146
That's impossible.

40:58.220 --> 41:02.452
Look, even with Ray Charles at the wheel,
you could get this round faster.

41:02.524 --> 41:03.582
Well, you didn't.

41:03.659 --> 41:09.291
So now, terrifyingly, the pride of a nation
rested with Terry Scott.

41:12.868 --> 41:14.893
Beautiful smooth six-cylinder engine.

41:14.970 --> 41:18.736
(Richard laughs) That is just a rubbish sight.

41:18.807 --> 41:21.207
- It's automatic as well.
- (Both laugh)

41:21.276 --> 41:24.643
The uneven suspension didn't help...

41:24.713 --> 41:25.941
Bloody Nora!

41:26.015 --> 41:28.609
...but that wasn't the biggest problem.

41:30.085 --> 41:32.485
Cock, gone the wrong way.

41:32.554 --> 41:34.579
What are you doing, man?

41:34.657 --> 41:39.458
You idiot! You stupid long-haired idiot!

41:41.530 --> 41:44.055
I don't think it will have affected the time
too badly.

41:45.501 --> 41:47.492
It was never gonna be good, but...

41:51.006 --> 41:52.564
OK.

41:52.641 --> 41:55.701
- Oh, I dropped it.
- Oh, that's cos it was better.

41:55.778 --> 41:58.246
(Jeremy) Are you gonna break it to him
or shall I?

41:58.313 --> 42:00.838
- He must know.
- He must feel it.

42:00.916 --> 42:02.577
He can't feel that went well.

42:02.651 --> 42:04.619
- So?
- He feels it went well.

42:04.687 --> 42:06.382
- What?
- I dropped the stopwatch.

42:06.455 --> 42:08.082
- Yeah.
- So, what was it really?

42:08.157 --> 42:09.488
Well, I dunno, I dropped it.

42:09.558 --> 42:11.526
- 1:02?
- Not, not...

42:11.593 --> 42:14.960
I think we all have to accept
that after the power challenge,

42:15.030 --> 42:17.965
where we should have done well,
we haven't.

42:18.033 --> 42:19.057
No.

42:19.134 --> 42:21.602
So, we've made... How much money
have we got back then?

42:21.670 --> 42:23.763
- Nothing.
- None at all.

42:23.839 --> 42:26.171
So, never mind,
we'll move on to the next challenge.

42:26.241 --> 42:27.538
Here it comes.

42:29.411 --> 42:34.280
"As you can see, The Stig's Datsun
is now parked on a one in three hill."

42:37.419 --> 42:38.511
Yes.

42:38.587 --> 42:41.681
"It is being held, no problem at all,
by its handbrake.

42:41.757 --> 42:46.558
"You will now park your cars there, put them
in neutral, apply the handbrake, get out.

42:46.628 --> 42:49.461
"You get L100 if it stays where it is."

42:49.531 --> 42:50.520
It's a simple test.

42:50.599 --> 42:53.124
Yours is pointing in the right direction.
You go first.

42:57.673 --> 43:00.301
(Richard) It is steeper than you think.
(Jeremy) It is very steep.

43:00.375 --> 43:02.605
Actually, it is a bit steeper than it looks.

43:02.678 --> 43:04.873
Right, stopped on the foot brake.

43:05.981 --> 43:08.848
- Ooh, would you get out of that now?
- No.

43:08.917 --> 43:10.851
His foot's still on the brakes, look.

43:10.919 --> 43:13.046
I'm not sure.

43:13.122 --> 43:14.248
What's he doing?

43:16.158 --> 43:18.183
That's the quickest I've ever seen him move.

43:18.260 --> 43:19.989
- How's that?
- You're there.

43:20.062 --> 43:21.620
- L100.
- Thank you.

43:21.697 --> 43:25.724
What a machine, the mighty Princess, yeah.
Genuinely pleased about that.

43:25.801 --> 43:28.235
- Watch this.
- Yeah, I'm going to.

43:29.972 --> 43:32.873
I was feeling confident about this test.

43:32.941 --> 43:36.809
All I had to do
was get to the stopping point.

43:36.879 --> 43:38.574
God, it is steep.

43:51.794 --> 43:53.819
I've never seen that before.

43:56.799 --> 44:02.066
Happily, the wheel spin generated so much
smoke, the car was hidden from view.

44:02.137 --> 44:05.800
I therefore claimed I'd done it,
and then it was Hammond's turn.

44:09.378 --> 44:10.845
- There he is, parked.
- Oh.

44:10.913 --> 44:12.881
No, that's not working for me at all.

44:12.948 --> 44:15.246
Er... (Grunts)

44:16.485 --> 44:18.680
His foot's out, his arm's out.

44:18.754 --> 44:20.119
OK.

44:21.623 --> 44:23.955
Ah, that's not gone well.

44:24.026 --> 44:27.894
- (Laughter)
- Sorry, that's gone badly wrong.

44:27.963 --> 44:30.193
- (Laughter)
- It's gonna come... Oh!

44:30.265 --> 44:33.666
- (Laughter)
- Sorry.

44:33.735 --> 44:36.260
Having failed the test,
he's knocked down the sign

44:36.338 --> 44:38.238
warning you how steep the hill is.

44:38.307 --> 44:41.208
Still, every cloud and all that.

44:41.276 --> 44:45.770
Good test of how fast it goes backwards
with the handbrake on.

44:46.782 --> 44:49.410
So, we tested the performance
and the handbrakes

44:49.484 --> 44:52.578
and now it was time
to look at ride comfort.

44:52.654 --> 44:54.053
Thank you very much.

44:54.122 --> 44:55.384
OK.

44:55.457 --> 44:59.325
"New cars are tested on MIRA's rough road
at 20 mph.

44:59.394 --> 45:02.386
"You will drive down it at 30 mph."

45:02.464 --> 45:04.227
I may not excel at this one.

45:04.299 --> 45:08.167
"Attached to the roof lining of your car
is a colander full of eggs."

45:08.237 --> 45:14.472
"The more your car shakes about,
the more egg will end up in your hair.

45:16.545 --> 45:21.141
"Each gram of egg left in the colander at
the end equals L10 paid into..." Who?

45:21.216 --> 45:23.309
This is the well-known industry egg test.

45:23.385 --> 45:25.444
Who thinks of this stuff?

45:25.520 --> 45:27.886
There's no egg cap rating, is there,
for new cars?

45:27.956 --> 45:29.981
Euro egg cap!

45:31.360 --> 45:35.990
We also learned that we'd lose money for any
pieces of trim that were dislodged

45:36.064 --> 45:39.033
by the savage cobbles
on MIRA 's rough road.

45:42.738 --> 45:44.729
Oh, God, it's rough.

45:44.806 --> 45:47.001
- Here he comes, here he comes!
- Yeah.

45:49.544 --> 45:52.012
Ah, got egg in my eye.

45:52.080 --> 45:53.445
Got egg on the wheel.

45:55.617 --> 45:58.108
It's a warm day as well,
let's be honest.

45:58.186 --> 46:01.587
Oh, and the glovebox has gone
and the radio panel.

46:01.657 --> 46:04.854
Look at that suspension working.
How's he looking?

46:04.927 --> 46:07.589
- Eggy.
- (Both laugh)

46:09.164 --> 46:12.133
He looks like a spaniel
that's crashed into the back of a hen.

46:12.200 --> 46:13.633
Ah!

46:15.904 --> 46:17.633
What's happened to you?

46:17.706 --> 46:19.003
I got covered in eggs.

46:19.074 --> 46:20.234
Where's your colander?

46:20.309 --> 46:22.436
Above my head.
Where the hell did you think it was?

46:22.511 --> 46:23.978
Could've been worse.

46:24.046 --> 46:25.206
Pretty much all of them.

46:25.280 --> 46:27.305
How many were there? Five eggs.

46:27.382 --> 46:29.475
There's a bit left in the bottom.

46:29.551 --> 46:32.850
The only thing that slightly worries me
looking at you...

46:32.921 --> 46:35.014
Is that one of my eyes is welded together
with egg?

46:35.090 --> 46:37.081
- No.
- That doesn't worry be at all, no.

46:37.159 --> 46:39.525
This is the most comfortable car here.

46:39.594 --> 46:41.027
Yes, it is.

46:41.096 --> 46:43.587
Which meant
that with my sports suspension,

46:43.665 --> 46:45.997
I was likely to become a human omelet.

46:46.068 --> 46:47.501
Right, we're off.

46:47.569 --> 46:50.163
Accelerate up to 30 mph.

46:55.577 --> 46:57.135
The glovebox has gone.

46:57.212 --> 47:01.273
It honestly isn't looking as bad as your car.
It is now looking as bad as your car.

47:03.051 --> 47:06.987
Not enjoying it at all.
It's gone down my neck. Oh!

47:08.423 --> 47:09.913
Something just came off.

47:09.992 --> 47:12.085
The bumper.
It's not going well.

47:12.160 --> 47:14.355
Ow, please just break!

47:17.199 --> 47:19.258
Oh, the sun visor's gone.

47:21.636 --> 47:25.231
I was working out the other day
how many classics Led Zep... (Laughs)

47:25.307 --> 47:29.243
I mean classics like Stairway.
Oh, dear.

47:29.311 --> 47:32.906
It wasn't even worth
measuring the egg residue,

47:32.981 --> 47:36.041
because I'd lost so much money
for bits falling off.

47:36.118 --> 47:40.817
Door mirror, glovebox lid,
oh, and this funny thing.

47:40.889 --> 47:42.083
That's three.

47:42.157 --> 47:44.148
- And this.
- Four.

47:44.226 --> 47:46.057
- And that.
- Five.

47:47.829 --> 47:50.059
- Technically, that.
- Six.

47:50.432 --> 47:52.457
I fired up the Rover.

47:52.534 --> 47:54.229
(Fan belt squealing)

47:55.670 --> 47:56.796
It does that.

47:56.872 --> 47:59.102
- I have more on the front. Why's that?
- Mine was...

47:59.174 --> 48:02.974
They could only mount it on... I have
to sit further forwards than you, cos I'm short.

48:03.045 --> 48:04.012
That's what it is.

48:06.348 --> 48:09.647
Oh-ho-ho, no!

48:10.719 --> 48:12.482
Now, that looks pretty poor.

48:12.554 --> 48:15.580
Coil springs absorbing all the bumps nicely.

48:15.657 --> 48:18.319
There's a lot of weight on those springs.

48:23.098 --> 48:25.066
Ooh!

48:27.302 --> 48:28.462
That was the door.

48:28.537 --> 48:29.799
Having fun?

48:31.840 --> 48:33.831
Still, I'd only lost one thing.

48:35.043 --> 48:37.477
Two things.

48:37.546 --> 48:41.778
...sunbleached. What you need to do
is find a bit that's not been exposed.

48:41.850 --> 48:43.750
British racing green was an official color.

48:43.819 --> 48:45.548
No worries.

48:47.255 --> 48:50.418
Except I desperately needed
to wash my hair.

48:50.492 --> 48:54.724
Oh, get off, Jeremy, that's disgus... ting!

48:54.796 --> 48:56.286
I don't know what's worse...

48:56.364 --> 48:58.662
I've just wiped my hair on a seat
that's 30 years old,

48:58.733 --> 49:00.701
and has had some Midlander's bottom on it.

49:02.537 --> 49:05.233
So, I borrowed
MIRA 's wet weather skidpan.

49:08.477 --> 49:13.642
Yeah, now, I'm drifting and washing my hair -
it's a world first.

49:16.384 --> 49:18.545
You're drifting, I'm drifting off.

49:18.620 --> 49:22.852
We'd tested speed, handbrakes
and ride comfort,

49:22.924 --> 49:24.789
but there was one more thing.

49:26.795 --> 49:29.263
I was told to weld my door back in place,

49:29.331 --> 49:32.528
and report with the others
to the Top Gear test track,

49:32.601 --> 49:34.364
in dry suits.

49:39.174 --> 49:41.199
- Mine doesn't fit.
- Oh, stop moaning.

49:41.276 --> 49:42.903
- It doesn't fit.
- Just pull it.

49:42.978 --> 49:46.709
There you go.
Oh, it's like watching it give birth to a thing.

49:46.781 --> 49:48.715
(Laughs)

49:48.783 --> 49:50.808
We were given the challenge.

49:50.886 --> 49:51.944
What?

49:52.020 --> 49:55.956
"Your cars will now be filled to the brim
with water,

49:56.024 --> 49:58.390
"and then you will drive round the track."

49:58.460 --> 50:00.087
That explains it.

50:00.162 --> 50:02.960
- How will you breathe?
- It doesn't say.

50:03.031 --> 50:08.025
It says "When the water level drops below the
bottom of the steering wheel, you will stop.

50:08.103 --> 50:11.038
"The person who covers the greatest distance
is the winner."

50:11.106 --> 50:14.337
Yeah, the water will come out of all the panels
that don't fit properly,

50:14.409 --> 50:18.402
so, the quicker the water comes out, the
less well made it is and the shorter distance.

50:18.480 --> 50:20.072
There's a speed side of it as well.

50:20.148 --> 50:24.050
If water's going to be gushing out and you've
got a really fast car, you'll go miles.

50:24.119 --> 50:27.577
Actually, it's quite a thorough test,
because it tests performance,

50:27.656 --> 50:31.023
and build quality for the water,
it's pretty thorough.

50:31.092 --> 50:32.889
It does say you go first.

50:32.961 --> 50:35.191
- Right.
- So, off you go.

50:35.263 --> 50:36.753
- See you.
- Right-o.

50:36.831 --> 50:39.493
You'll be the first person ever
to drive a car underwater.

50:39.568 --> 50:41.661
- Were you making it up?
- Yes. (Laughs)

50:44.105 --> 50:46.801
The cars would be filled by fire trucks,

50:46.875 --> 50:51.278
and to make sure they didn't leak so badly
that they couldn't be brimmed with water,

50:51.346 --> 50:54.474
the doors were sealed with gaffer tape.

50:56.451 --> 50:58.385
You could've used warm water.

50:58.453 --> 51:00.080
It's freezing.

51:00.155 --> 51:05.354
Oh, there's 30-odd years worth of fag ends
and fluff coming up on top.

51:05.427 --> 51:07.759
Look at it going up the window.
It's fantastic.

51:07.829 --> 51:09.763
(Laughs) Oh, I can hear him.

51:14.803 --> 51:15.792
Go, go, go!

51:16.571 --> 51:20.200
The extra weight
did blunt the Dolly's performance.

51:30.852 --> 51:33.719
- And he's leaving a big trail.
- That's a big trail of water.

51:35.123 --> 51:38.524
Fortunately, because the water
came out so quickly,

51:38.593 --> 51:41.027
I was soon able to pick up some speed.

51:41.096 --> 51:43.997
One thing they said
is that the weight of the water is so immense,

51:44.065 --> 51:48.001
that as you go round a corner, you could
slosh over to one side and roll over.

51:51.940 --> 51:54.500
Imagine filling the insurance form in on that.

51:54.576 --> 51:55.907
"Well, how did he drown?"

51:55.977 --> 51:59.105
- This is gonna take more than that little...
- Little box.

52:01.349 --> 52:05.080
Despite the Dolly's leakiness,
I made it past Hammerhead.

52:08.023 --> 52:09.684
That's fallen out.

52:09.758 --> 52:11.350
Whoo!

52:11.426 --> 52:15.362
I better be honest, that's just dipped below
the steering wheel now.

52:15.430 --> 52:18.922
He's stopped. He's stopped
just before the Follow-through.

52:22.037 --> 52:23.163
More than half a lap.

52:23.238 --> 52:26.036
Moe than half a lap.
D'you think you can beat that?

52:26.107 --> 52:27.335
Let's see.

52:29.210 --> 52:30.677
Here we go.

52:30.745 --> 52:31.939
Oh, look at this.

52:32.013 --> 52:35.847
One of the issues with the Austin Princess
we're able to determine now -

52:35.917 --> 52:37.680
very badly fitted door handles.

52:37.752 --> 52:40.118
It should've been called the Austin Colander.

52:40.188 --> 52:43.123
Even so, it was filling quite well.

52:43.191 --> 52:44.954
This is a great sport.

52:45.026 --> 52:48.291
And I checked to make sure
James' snorkel was working.

52:50.065 --> 52:52.033
(James wailing)

52:53.468 --> 52:54.992
And go!

52:55.070 --> 52:58.164
- Wow, look at the speed!
- (Laughter)

53:00.742 --> 53:04.041
The other great thing is, James still
has no idea how to drive round this track -

53:04.112 --> 53:05.340
he never does power tests.

53:08.083 --> 53:11.314
Oh, he's doing it right, about at
the same speed Terry Wogan went round in.

53:13.021 --> 53:15.819
Nevertheless,
James was doing brilliantly.

53:15.890 --> 53:17.323
I'm gonna pass Hammond.

53:17.392 --> 53:19.553
There it is, yes!

53:19.627 --> 53:24.724
In fact, the Princess could hold its drink
so well, he did a full lap.

53:25.467 --> 53:28.493
- He's not cheating, I can't believe it!
- He's still there!

53:28.570 --> 53:31.300
And then he passed Hammond againl

53:31.373 --> 53:34.069
Yes! Yes!

53:34.142 --> 53:35.837
And I've just lost it.

53:35.910 --> 53:39.402
- You've been lapped... by Captain Slow.
- Doesn't happen every day.

53:39.481 --> 53:40.971
In an Austin Princess full of water.

53:45.920 --> 53:48.855
- Right, bring on the Rover!
- Yeah!

53:49.724 --> 53:51.521
The water thundered in...

53:51.593 --> 53:53.993
This is quite cold now.

53:54.062 --> 53:57.225
...and came straight out again.

53:57.298 --> 54:00.665
We're having to use two hoses
because your Rover leaks so badly...

54:00.735 --> 54:02.396
Rubbish!

54:02.470 --> 54:04.495
I was only bothered
about my secret weapon.

54:04.572 --> 54:08.008
Yeah, height adjustable.

54:08.076 --> 54:09.839
- He's lowered it.
- Cheating...

54:10.812 --> 54:13.042
Two hoses still weren't enough.

54:13.114 --> 54:16.606
We're gonna have to put a third hosepipe
in to fill it.

54:28.096 --> 54:29.859
Jeremy, it's not filling up.

54:29.931 --> 54:32.593
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

54:32.667 --> 54:36.865
Eventually, we became bored
and the tankers became empty,

54:36.938 --> 54:38.371
so we sent him on his way.

54:38.440 --> 54:39.839
Go!

54:39.908 --> 54:42.001
Yeah, feel the power.

54:44.579 --> 54:46.376
It's looking good.

54:47.949 --> 54:49.974
Oh!

54:50.051 --> 54:51.985
(Both laugh)

54:52.053 --> 54:54.419
The damn door's come off.

54:54.489 --> 54:55.581
(Laughs)

54:56.858 --> 54:59.793
- That's quite a big panel gap you've got there.
- That is quite a gap.

54:59.861 --> 55:01.260
You lost that badly.

55:01.329 --> 55:04.127
- You're last place, mate.
- In that test.

55:04.199 --> 55:06.133
(Applause)

55:13.575 --> 55:14.974
That...

55:15.977 --> 55:18.673
That wasn't even the door
that you welded back on?

55:18.746 --> 55:24.275
No, I'll tell you exactly what happened here.
This car, this Rover, has been lightly restored

55:24.352 --> 55:26.980
by some previous owner,
who was probably an ape.

55:27.055 --> 55:30.923
It's a good point, because my dad had three
of those and none of the doors ever fell off.

55:30.992 --> 55:32.926
It's not Rover's fault,
they were built brilliantly.

55:32.994 --> 55:34.928
In fact, I seem to remember at the time,

55:34.996 --> 55:39.592
the SD1 was often praised
for the way its back doors stayed on.

55:39.667 --> 55:42.636
Exactly. No, no,
it was one of the key features of the car.

55:42.704 --> 55:45.673
Anyway, now,
we've gotta do some totting up.

55:45.740 --> 55:48.140
We've got the chart over here,
I've got a pen.

55:49.177 --> 55:51.907
Now, this is what we paid for the cars.

55:53.047 --> 56:00.078
We were given L100 if we could get to
the top secret test track on the A5,

56:00.154 --> 56:02.349
without any mechanical problems.

56:02.423 --> 56:05.551
- I didn't do that.
- No, I didn't do that.

56:05.627 --> 56:09.427
- I didn't do that.
- So, that's no pounds to us for that.

56:09.497 --> 56:11.727
The power test against the Datsun.

56:11.799 --> 56:12.766
- Nothing?
- No.

56:12.834 --> 56:16.292
No, naught there coming back.

56:16.371 --> 56:17.702
The handbrake test.

56:17.772 --> 56:19.171
I didn't do that either.

56:19.240 --> 56:23.472
No, it was a sad moment that,
it was no pounds back for you.

56:23.545 --> 56:25.206
- I did.
- You did.

56:25.280 --> 56:27.942
- That's L100.
- And you?

56:28.016 --> 56:29.142
I did it as well.

56:29.217 --> 56:31.117
(Laughter)

56:31.185 --> 56:35.485
Well, we never saw you do it, but if you say
you did it, then, Jeremy, you did it.

56:35.557 --> 56:38.025
- Absolutely, so that's L100 back to me.
- Yeah.

56:38.092 --> 56:40.959
Er... The egg test. An important test.

56:41.029 --> 56:47.764
Yeah, now I had four grams of egg left but
I lost two trim pieces, so that's... I'm L20 up.

56:47.835 --> 56:49.826
- L20 up for James, well done.
- Well done.

56:50.471 --> 56:56.103
I had four grams left and I lost two trim pieces,
one of them was quite large, I admit,

56:56.177 --> 56:58.873
but nevertheless, L20 up.
Richard?

56:58.947 --> 57:03.441
I had no egg left at all
and six trim pieces fell off, so...

57:04.519 --> 57:07.613
...I'm L60 down.
- Yeah, you're minus 60.

57:07.689 --> 57:11.022
- That's not going well for the Dolly.
- A let-down for BL, I'm sorry.

57:11.092 --> 57:12.081
Now, the water test.

57:12.160 --> 57:15.891
Yeah, now, this we got 20 pence
for every yard you covered.

57:15.964 --> 57:20.560
- You did 1,500 yards, so...
- Yes.

57:20.635 --> 57:24.162
- That's um...
- It's L300, you halfwit!

57:24.238 --> 57:27.071
- (Laughter)
- It was right on the tip of my tongue.

57:27.141 --> 57:31.475
300 for him.
Yes, L300 back, well done.

57:31.546 --> 57:39.078
I did... I did 4,500 yards,
which I think you'll find is L900.

57:39.153 --> 57:40.780
- Well done!
- L900!

57:40.855 --> 57:43.255
That's better than going on The Weakest Link.
L900.

57:43.324 --> 57:44.348
(Laughter)

57:44.425 --> 57:47.121
- And you did ten yards, Jeremy.
- That's L2.

57:47.195 --> 57:48.389
(Laughter)

57:48.463 --> 57:50.158
- Every little helps.
- Put it on.

57:50.231 --> 57:53.200
OK, so, let's tot it up,
let's see how we did.

57:53.267 --> 58:02.437
OK, so, Richard, you are L1,010
out of pocket, that's minus.

58:02.510 --> 58:08.710
I'm... L978 out of pocket.

58:08.783 --> 58:11.081
- Well done.
- And James, you are...

58:11.152 --> 58:13.916
...you're L20 in the black!
- Oh, brilliant!

58:13.988 --> 58:15.683
James is the winner!

58:15.757 --> 58:17.657
(Applause and cheering)

58:17.725 --> 58:18.817
Thank you all.

58:18.893 --> 58:20.554
Congratulations.

58:23.331 --> 58:24.855
You...

58:26.000 --> 58:28.400
You have proved...

58:28.469 --> 58:31.438
You've proved
to the producers of the show,

58:31.506 --> 58:33.701
you've proved to the nation,
and indeed the world,

58:33.775 --> 58:38.405
that British Leyland did make a good car,
and here it is -

- Yeah!

58:43.551 --> 58:45.109
Yeah, Britain made a good car.

58:45.186 --> 58:46.619
Yeah.

58:47.922 --> 58:49.685
- Well done, James.
- Thank you.

58:54.362 --> 58:56.796

Thank you very much for watching.
Take care. Bye!
