WEBVTT

02:52.620 --> 02:53.690
AH.

02:58.830 --> 02:59.900
OH, YEAH.

03:01.830 --> 03:03.800
HUH?

03:03.870 --> 03:04.870
MMM.

03:04.930 --> 03:06.140
SESAME SEED?

03:06.200 --> 03:07.270
MY MOLECULAR RECONSTRUCTOR

03:07.340 --> 03:09.240
IS A CUTTING EDGE
SCIENTIFIC TOOL.

03:09.310 --> 03:12.110
NOT A FAST FOOD MAKER.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.310
LOOK I CAN ADJUST THE
MAGNETIC FLUX CAPACITORS.

03:16.380 --> 03:19.320
SO PLEASE KEEP YOUR HANDS
OFF MY STUFF.

03:19.380 --> 03:20.920
ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY
YOU CAN TRUST ME

03:20.980 --> 03:22.190
BECAUSE I'M HONEST.

03:22.250 --> 03:23.550
AND SEE, NO HANDS ON STUFF.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.990
OF COURSE, I NEVER SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT MY BEAK.

03:30.190 --> 03:31.700
WHOA! THERE IT IS.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.970
WHOA! TOTALLY SWEET,
SWEET, SWEET.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.540
OOH, A VIDEO GAME.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.540
DID SOMEONE SAY
VIDEO GAME?

03:42.610 --> 03:44.110
HEY!

03:46.580 --> 03:47.840
COOL.

03:47.910 --> 03:49.650
WATCH OUT.

03:50.650 --> 03:52.550
I CALL THIS
MY BALLISTIC BUNNY BLAST.

03:52.620 --> 03:54.980
HEY, WHEN IT COMES
TO VIDEO GAMES,

03:55.050 --> 03:57.590
THIS BUNNY'S GOT THE MOJO.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.360
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

04:00.420 --> 04:02.730
WELL, FOR ONE THING,
HIGH SCORE.

04:02.790 --> 04:03.930
THAT'S NO GAME.

04:03.990 --> 04:07.030
THAT'S MY NEW X3000
AUTOMATED WEAPON SYSTEM.

04:07.100 --> 04:10.400
UH-OH. SO THAT WAS
A REAL TARGET AND MISSILES?

04:10.470 --> 04:11.870
I WOULDN'T WORRY BECAUSE
THERE ARE BILLIONS

04:11.940 --> 04:13.700
OF UNINHABITABLE PLANETS
AND ASTEROIDS OUT THERE.

04:13.770 --> 04:15.040
WHAT ARE THE ODDS
OF HITTING SOMETHING

04:15.100 --> 04:17.270
THAT HAD SOMEONE
LIVING ON IT, HUH?

04:21.140 --> 04:22.680
WHOO.

04:22.750 --> 04:25.950
HOW DARE SOMEONE ATTACK MY
SPACECRAFT WITHOUT REASON.

04:26.020 --> 04:28.150
ATTACKING A SPACECRAFT
WITHOUT REASON

04:28.220 --> 04:30.850
IS WHAT I DO.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.960
EJECTING ENEMY MISSILE.

04:44.370 --> 04:48.570
TRACKING ENEMY MISSILE'S
POINT OF ORIGIN.

04:48.640 --> 04:52.340
AH, HERE'S WHERE
THE MISSILES WERE LAUNCHED FROM.

04:52.410 --> 04:54.380
ACMETROPOLIS.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.350
PERHAPS I WILL
CONGRATULATE THEM

04:56.410 --> 04:58.850
ON A MOST IMPRESSIVE ATTACK.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.020
OR BETTER YET,

05:00.080 --> 05:04.190
I WILL BLOW UP ACMETROPOLIS.

05:11.190 --> 05:15.530
* ROCK 'N' SET,
LOONATICS, LET'S JET *

05:15.600 --> 05:18.300
* REV, LEXI, AND TECH *

05:18.370 --> 05:21.300
* SLAM, AND DUCK *

05:21.370 --> 05:23.440
* ROCK 'N' SET, LET'S JET *

05:23.510 --> 05:26.580
* ACE IS COOL
AND LEADS THE PACK *

05:26.640 --> 05:30.850
* LASER SWORD
STRIKES 'EM BACK *

05:30.910 --> 05:32.880
* WHEN BIG, BAD BOTS
SMASH AND ATTACK *

05:32.950 --> 05:34.820
* LEXI'S BRAIN-BLAST
MAKES 'EM CRACK *

05:34.880 --> 05:36.920
* QUACKIN' IN, QUACKIN' OUT *

05:36.990 --> 05:39.190
* DUCK WILL
MAKE INVADERS SHOUT *

05:39.260 --> 05:40.820
* ACTIVATE, REGENERATE *

05:40.890 --> 05:43.390
* MAGNETIC POWERS LEVITATE *

05:43.460 --> 05:45.560
* ROCK 'N' SET, LET'S JET *

05:49.030 --> 05:51.200
* BAM, SLAM *

05:51.270 --> 05:53.670
* TORNADO ZING BLING BAUBLES *

05:53.740 --> 05:55.370
* SET, LET'S JET *

05:55.440 --> 05:59.280
* SUPERSONIC REV HEATS 'EM UP
AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT *

05:59.340 --> 06:01.080
* SET, LET'S JET *

06:04.250 --> 06:08.590
* R-R-ROCK 'N' SET, LET'S JET *

06:09.790 --> 06:12.320
* WHOO! POWERS

06:12.390 --> 06:14.390
* TONS OF EGO,
LOTS OF NERVE *

06:14.460 --> 06:16.160
* NEVER QUESTION,
NEVER SWERVE *

06:16.230 --> 06:19.130
* LOONATICS UNLEASHED *

06:32.640 --> 06:36.010
ALSO, FOR DESTROYING
MY GALACTIC DEATH CRUISER,

06:36.080 --> 06:38.650
MY COLLECTION OF
HAND PAINTED SPACE DISHES,

06:38.720 --> 06:41.720
MY MARTIANS PLAYING
POKER PAINTING,

06:41.790 --> 06:44.590
AND MY MARTIAN FROG
AND MONKEY STATUE,

06:44.650 --> 06:47.560
I DEMAND YOU SURRENDER
AT ONCE.

06:47.620 --> 06:50.190
OR YOUR PLANET
WILL BE DESTROYED.

06:51.460 --> 06:53.960
BY THE WAY,
NICE MISSILE TARGETING.

06:54.030 --> 06:56.930
THANKS. I MEAN,
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.430
WE FELT WE WERE
PLAYING A GAME,

06:58.500 --> 06:59.670
BUT IT WASN'T A GAME,
IT WAS REAL,

06:59.740 --> 07:00.770
BUT OF COURSE,
YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT,

07:00.840 --> 07:02.370
OR YOU SORT OF
KNEW THAT

07:02.440 --> 07:04.440
AND IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW THAT NOW.
YOU KNOW.

07:04.510 --> 07:06.940
I SAY MINI MEAN AND GREEN
HERE IS ALL TALK.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.380
BRAVE WORDS FROM SOMEONE
WHO'S A FINGER SNACK

07:09.450 --> 07:11.080
WHERE I COME FROM.

07:11.150 --> 07:13.050
LIKE I HAVEN'T HEARD
THAT ONE BEFORE.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.720
I BET YOU COULDN'T HIT
THE BROAD SIDE

07:14.780 --> 07:16.320
OF THE MOON
WITH THAT THING.

07:16.390 --> 07:18.090
OH, REALLY?

07:22.430 --> 07:25.060
AHA. EASY SHOT.

07:25.130 --> 07:27.100
I BET YOU COULDN'T HIT
SOMETHING SMALLER

07:27.160 --> 07:29.100
LIKE THOSE STARS OVER THERE.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.710
OK,
ANOTHER EASY SHOT.

07:36.770 --> 07:38.840
HOW ABOUT TRYING
THE SUN, BUDDY.

07:38.910 --> 07:40.480
BUT THIS TIME,
WITH YOUR EYES SHUT.

07:40.540 --> 07:43.480
LET'S NOT GET
CARRIED AWAY HERE, DUCK.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.580
LEAVE SOMETHING
THAT TWINKLES UP THERE.

07:45.650 --> 07:47.950
MAYBE I SHOULD DO
THE TALKING.

07:48.020 --> 07:50.320
I MEAN, I AM THE ONE
WHO CAUSED THIS.

07:50.390 --> 07:53.220
HI, MR. MELVIN
THE MARTIAN SIR.

07:53.290 --> 07:54.760
LOVE YOUR HELMET
AND THOSE SHOES.

07:54.820 --> 07:57.460
I ALWAYS HEARD MARTIANS
HAD THE BEST FASHION SENSE.

07:57.530 --> 07:58.560
BEST FASHION SENSE?

07:58.630 --> 08:01.870
THE GUY'S WEARING A TUTU.

08:01.930 --> 08:04.300
LISTEN, CORNBALL,
IF YOU TAKE OVER ACMETROPOLIS,

08:04.370 --> 08:06.170
IT'S JUST GONNA BE
ONE MORE PLANET

08:06.240 --> 08:07.740
FOR YOU TO KEEP TRACK OF.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.840
TRUE. I DO HAVE
SO MANY PLANETS.

08:10.910 --> 08:13.180
IT'S HARD TO KEEP COUNT.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.110
LISTEN, CHUM. YOU HAVE TO
SHRINK ACMETROPOLIS

08:16.180 --> 08:17.450
JUST TO MAKE ROOM.

08:17.510 --> 08:21.520
GOOD IDEA.

08:21.590 --> 08:23.590
I'LL SHRINK
EVERYTHING ON IT

08:23.650 --> 08:25.860
AND ADD IT
TO MY COLLECTION.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.420
YOU SEE HOW EASY
I HANDLED THAT?

08:27.490 --> 08:29.560
NOW HE'S ONLY GOING TO...

08:29.630 --> 08:31.730
SHRINK OUR PLANET!

08:31.800 --> 08:33.230
PLEASE, DON'T DO
ANYTHING RASH

08:33.300 --> 08:36.000
JUST BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS
PLAYING SOME SILLY GAME.

08:36.070 --> 08:38.700
YOU MUST BE A VERY GOOD
GAME PLAYER.

08:38.770 --> 08:42.170
MMM. I'VE JUST
LEARNED A NEW GAME.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.870
CELESTIAL CHECKERS.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.110
UNFORTUNATELY,
SERGEANT SIRIUS

08:46.180 --> 08:50.480
LACKS A CPU STRONG ENOUGH
TO MASTER SUCH A GAME.

08:52.120 --> 08:55.220
HE'S MORE OF A ROCK, PAPER
SCISSORS KIND OF ROBOT.

08:55.280 --> 08:56.450
THAT'S TOO BAD.

08:56.520 --> 08:57.750
IT'S NOT MUCH FUN
PLAYING GAMES

08:57.820 --> 08:59.490
WHEN NO ONE AROUND
HAS YOUR SKILLS.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.560
BELIEVE ME, I CAN RELATE.

09:01.630 --> 09:03.830
OH, GOODY.
THEN IT'S SETTLED.

09:03.890 --> 09:07.030
I WON'T DESTROY
OR SHRINK YOUR PLANET.

09:07.100 --> 09:08.800
I'LL JUST TAKE YOU.

09:08.870 --> 09:10.500
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
TAKE ME?

09:10.570 --> 09:12.400
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN HERE
SPACE CADET.

09:12.470 --> 09:14.300
NO ONE'S TAKING LEXI.

09:14.370 --> 09:15.570
OOH.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.640
HEY, HEY, HEY.
COME HERE FOR A SECOND.

09:17.710 --> 09:19.210
LET'S NOT BE TOO HASTY.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.580
I MEAN, WHAT'S SO BAD

09:20.640 --> 09:22.050
ABOUT TRAVELING
AND PLAYING CHECKERS, EH?

09:22.110 --> 09:23.480
HOW MANY PEOPLE
CAN SAY THEY'VE BEEN

09:23.550 --> 09:26.720
A BILLION
LIGHT YEARS AWAY?

09:26.780 --> 09:29.650
YOU HAVE 24 HOURS
TO RECONSIDER.

09:29.720 --> 09:30.850
AFTER THAT, ACMETROPOLIS

09:30.920 --> 09:35.320
WILL BE VERY HARD TO FIND
ON ANY MAP.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.600
YOU MEAN LIKE WEARING
A TUTU OUT IN PUBLIC.

09:43.670 --> 09:47.640
I MEAN LIKE PRODUCING
A TRILLION TIMES THE POWER

09:47.700 --> 09:48.970
OF OUR ENTIRE PLANET.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.210
WITH THAT MUCH JUICE,
WE'RE TOAST.

09:52.280 --> 09:53.310
HUH?

09:53.380 --> 09:54.780
WELL, WE GOT NO CHOICE.

09:54.840 --> 09:56.580
IF TINY WANTS A WAR,

09:56.650 --> 09:58.010
WE'LL GIVE HIM A WAR.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.720
OR WE COULD JUST GIVE HIM
WHAT'S HER NAME.

09:59.780 --> 10:02.250
LISTEN, GUYS. DUCK'S RIGHT.

10:02.320 --> 10:03.590
I'M THE ONE TO BLAME.

10:03.650 --> 10:05.990
I FEEL LIKE
HELEN OF TROY.

10:06.060 --> 10:06.760
WHO?

10:06.820 --> 10:09.090
I DON'T GET IT.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.330
HER BEAUTY BROUGHT ON
THE TROJAN WAR.

10:11.390 --> 10:14.760
PLEASE. THIS ISN'T
ABOUT YOUR BEAUTY

10:14.830 --> 10:16.730
BUT ABOUT YOUR
BALLISTIC BUNNY BLAST.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.570
BUT I DO AGREE,
YOU DESERVE THE BLAME.

10:18.630 --> 10:19.900
NO. I'M THE ONE
WHO HACKED

10:19.970 --> 10:21.100
INTO TECH'S COMPUTER
IN THE FIRST PLACE

10:21.170 --> 10:22.470
WHICH MAKES ME THE ONE
TO BLAME.

10:22.540 --> 10:24.070
RIGHT. YOU DESERVE
THE BLAME.

10:24.140 --> 10:26.780
BUT I CREATED
THE WEAPON SYSTEM PROGRAM.

10:26.840 --> 10:30.950
IF ANYONE'S TO BLAME,
IT'S ME.

10:31.010 --> 10:33.350
I AGREE.

10:33.420 --> 10:36.320
I SAY THERE'S PLENTY OF BLAME
HERE FOR ALL 3 OF YOU.

10:39.090 --> 10:41.830
HEY, MAYBE WE COULD
SHIP THEM ALL OUT.

10:44.990 --> 10:48.430
LET THE INVASION BEGIN.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.700
WELL, IT'S BEEN 24 HOURS

10:49.770 --> 10:52.040
AND STILL NO SIGN
OF THE MARTIAN.

10:52.100 --> 10:54.440
I KNEW SHORT STACK
WAS BLUFFING.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.770
UH, DON'T THINK SO.

11:08.790 --> 11:10.990
CITIZENS OF ACMETROPOLIS,
DO NOT PANIC.

11:11.050 --> 11:13.890
WE WILL PROTECT YOU
FROM THE INVADER.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.140
COMMENCE FIRING!

11:40.280 --> 11:42.150
COOL!

11:49.230 --> 11:51.660
THE INVADERS ARE COMING UP
THROUGH ACMETROPOLIS.

11:51.730 --> 11:54.700
SHRINKING ALL BUILDINGS
IN SIGHT.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.530
NOW BEAT THEM.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.130
I'M PUTTING UP
THE DEFLECTOR SHIELDS.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.940
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG THEY'LL LAST

12:00.000 --> 12:01.540
WITHOUT MORE POWER.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.170
MAYBE YOU COULD PLUG THEM INTO
A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT OUTLETS.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.940
YOU'RE BRILLIANT.
WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT.

12:08.010 --> 12:11.180
SERGEANT SIRIUS,
PRETTY SOON

12:11.250 --> 12:13.420
I'LL HAVE ALL OF
ACMETROPOLIS

12:13.480 --> 12:15.790
IN THE PALM OF MY HAND.

12:15.850 --> 12:19.320
LITERALLY.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.650
SO, UH, YOU THINK
THIS SOUPED UP GIZMO

12:42.710 --> 12:44.110
WILL DO THE JOB?

12:44.180 --> 12:47.120
WELL, THE MOLECULAR
RECONSTRUCTOR IS MY DESIGN.

12:47.180 --> 12:50.120
ONLY HITCH IS WE'RE GOING
TO NEED A LOT MORE POWER

12:50.190 --> 12:51.750
TO GET ALL OF
THE SHRUNKEN BUILDINGS

12:51.820 --> 12:53.190
BACK TO SIZE.

12:53.260 --> 12:55.120
WE BARELY HAVE ENOUGH POWER
TO KEEP UP THE SHIELDS.

12:55.190 --> 12:57.360
I KNOW YOU'RE
FEELING BAD, LEXI.

12:57.430 --> 13:00.000
BLAMING YOURSELF FOR THIS
WHOLE MESS YOU CAUSED,

13:00.060 --> 13:01.700
BUT YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.030
OH, THANKS.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.200
WHY IS IT
THAT THROUGHOUT HISTORY

13:05.270 --> 13:07.640
SO MANY HAVE TO SUFFER
FOR THE ACTS OF A FEW?

13:07.700 --> 13:09.670
OF IN THIS CASE, JUST ONE.

13:09.740 --> 13:12.880
THANKS, DUCK.
I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

13:12.940 --> 13:17.010
HEY. THAT'S WHAT
ACTION HERO FRIENDS ARE FOR.

13:22.550 --> 13:23.820
IT'S THE POWER GRID.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.120
WE'RE LOSING
SECTOR 3 SHIELDS.

13:25.190 --> 13:27.220
ACCORDING TO MY
CALCULATIONS,

13:27.290 --> 13:29.490
MELVIN'S FORCES
WILL BREAK THROUGH BY MORNING.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.360
WELL, NO ONE'S TURNING
OUR HEADQUARTERS

13:31.430 --> 13:32.700
INTO A DOLL HOUSE.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.400
I'LL REROUTE
AVAILABLE POWER.

13:34.460 --> 13:36.930
I CAN'T SAY HOW LONG
IT WILL HOLD UP.

13:52.820 --> 13:53.920
HUH?

13:53.980 --> 13:57.090
TECH. WAKE UP.

13:57.150 --> 14:00.160
THE MARTIAN ARMY.
WHERE ARE THEY?

14:02.460 --> 14:04.590
THEY'RE RETREATING.

14:04.660 --> 14:05.630
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?

14:05.690 --> 14:07.430
NO CLUE.

14:07.500 --> 14:08.700
DON'T ASK ME.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.900
I DON'T KNOW.
THEY'RE UGLY.

14:10.970 --> 14:13.540
I GUESS MARTIAN BOY
FINALLY REALIZED

14:13.600 --> 14:15.000
WHO HE WAS UP AGAINST.

14:15.070 --> 14:18.170
THE GREATEST ACTION HERO
IN THE GALAXY.

14:18.240 --> 14:20.140
HUH.

14:20.210 --> 14:23.010
HEY, UH,
ANYONE SEEN LEXI?

14:24.080 --> 14:25.450
THIS MIGHT EXPLAIN.

14:25.510 --> 14:26.550
IT'S FROM LEXI.

14:26.620 --> 14:28.220
A HOLOGRAM?

14:31.250 --> 14:32.260
HI, GUYS.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.020
SORRY TO SKIP OUT ON YOU
WITHOUT A GOODBYE,

14:34.090 --> 14:36.530
BUT I KNEW YOU'D TRY
TO TALK ME OUT

14:36.590 --> 14:37.930
OF WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

14:37.990 --> 14:40.900
I DECIDED TO TAKE MELVIN
UP ON HIS OFFER.

14:43.630 --> 14:44.630
WHAT?

14:44.700 --> 14:46.400
I MEAN, WHY
WOULD SHE DO THAT?

14:46.470 --> 14:47.470
YOU KNOW WOMEN.

14:47.540 --> 14:49.040
WHEN THEY GET SOMETHING
INTO THEIR HEADS,

14:49.110 --> 14:50.370
THERE'S NO STOPPING THEM.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.610
YOU CAN TRY,
BUT THEY NEVER LISTEN.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.680
OH, ALMOST FORGOT.

14:54.740 --> 14:56.510
THANKS FOR YOUR ADVICE, DUCK.

14:56.580 --> 14:59.050
YOU WERE RIGHT, IT IS BETTER
TO SACRIFICE ONE

14:59.120 --> 15:01.120
THAN FOR ALL TO PERISH.

15:06.020 --> 15:09.390
WHA--YEAH...OBVIOUSLY,

15:09.460 --> 15:11.890
I WAS TAKEN COMPLETELY
OUT OF CONTEXT.

15:11.960 --> 15:14.660
OK, TECH, USE YOUR
MOLECULAR RECONSTRUCTOR

15:14.730 --> 15:15.800
TO SIZE THINGS UP

15:15.860 --> 15:17.500
WHILE THE REST OF US
GO AFTER LEXI.

15:17.570 --> 15:20.140
UNFORTUNATELY,
MY REMOTE SECURITY SCAN

15:20.200 --> 15:22.110
INDICATES THAT
THE MARTIAN SPACECRAFT

15:22.170 --> 15:23.270
IS IMPENETRABLE.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.810
HMM. SAY, REMEMBER
WHAT LEXI SAID

15:25.870 --> 15:27.240
ABOUT FEELING LIKE
HELEN OF TROY?

15:27.310 --> 15:29.250
MAYBE WE CAN MAKE HER
REALLY FEEL THAT WAY.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.080
THAT LED TO US
DOING THE DOING

15:35.150 --> 15:36.290
THAT WAS DONE BY MY DOING.

15:36.350 --> 15:37.890
WE HAVE AN OFFER
OF PEACE

15:37.950 --> 15:40.260
WITH GENERAL MELVIN
THE MARTIAN.

15:55.970 --> 15:57.570
HUH?

15:59.380 --> 16:01.680
I BELIEVE THAT
BELONGS TO ME.

16:06.520 --> 16:09.190
I CAN'T LOSE
AT THIS GAME, LEXI.

16:09.250 --> 16:13.560
OH, YEAH? I'M GONNA BEAT
THAT TUTU OFF OF YOU.

16:18.160 --> 16:21.000
OOH. I LOVE THIS GAME.

16:24.670 --> 16:26.000
SILLY RABBIT.

16:26.070 --> 16:28.640
BOW BEFORE THE CELESTIAL
CHECKERS MASTER.

16:28.700 --> 16:31.610
HEY, YOU CAN'T
MOVE LIKE THAT.

16:31.670 --> 16:34.410
YOU CAN WHEN IT'S
YOUR BOARD.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.050
UGH. I'VE GOT
A FUNNY FEELING

16:38.110 --> 16:40.650
THIS IS GOING TO GET OLD
REAL FAST.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.250
MELVIN.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.890
HOW ABOUT A REMATCH?

16:46.960 --> 16:48.660
OH, DOUBLE OR NOTHING?

16:48.720 --> 16:51.130
WHERE TO START LOOKING.

16:51.190 --> 16:53.730
THIS BUCKET OF BOLTS
IS HUGE.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.130
AND THERE SEEMS TO BE
NOBODY AROUND.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.900
NO WONDER MELVIN
THE MARTIAN IS LONELY.

16:56.970 --> 16:58.400
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT
WOULD BE LIKE TO BE ALL ALONE

16:58.470 --> 16:59.970
AND NOT HAVE ANYONE
TO TALK TO DAY AFTER DAY

17:00.040 --> 17:01.270
AFTER DAY AFTER DAY
AFTER DAY?

17:01.340 --> 17:03.070
YEAH. PARADISE.

17:03.140 --> 17:04.740
ALL RIGHT.
HERE'S THE PLAN.

17:04.810 --> 17:06.110
DUCK AND I WILL LOOK FOR LEX.

17:06.180 --> 17:09.450
SLAM, YOU COVER US AND TRY
NOT TO EAT ANYTHING.

17:09.510 --> 17:11.510
NO EAT?

17:11.580 --> 17:12.980
UH-HUH.

17:13.050 --> 17:14.780
OK, OK.

17:14.850 --> 17:16.650
REV, FIND
THE SHIP'S COMPUTER

17:16.720 --> 17:17.720
AND BEGIN THE UPLOAD.

17:17.790 --> 17:19.690
I'M ALREADY THERE.

17:23.130 --> 17:25.060
WE'LL NEVER FIND LEXI.

17:25.130 --> 17:27.000
I SAY WE CUT OUR LOSSES
AND GO HOME.

17:27.060 --> 17:30.870
WE CAN DIVIDE UP OUR STUFF
AND CALL IT A DAY.

17:30.930 --> 17:31.930
DUCK.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.240
WHAT?

17:33.300 --> 17:34.600
YOU CAN HAVE FIRST PICK.

17:34.670 --> 17:37.570
YOUR PRIMITIVE BUNNY
BRAIN, LEXI,

17:37.640 --> 17:41.640
IS NO MATCH FOR MY
SUPERIOR MARTIAN MIND.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.310
WHAT'S UP, TECH?

17:44.380 --> 17:45.750
THE MARTIAN'S
DOUBLE-CROSSED US.

17:45.810 --> 17:47.380
THE WARSHIPS ARE BACK.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.690
THE WEIRD THING IS
THE PATTERN OF CITY BLOCKS

17:56.760 --> 18:00.460
BEING MINIATURIZED KIND OF
LOOKS LIKE A CHECKERBOARD.

18:03.700 --> 18:04.900
CHECKERBOARD, HUH?

18:04.970 --> 18:08.200
YOU MIGHT WANT TO COVER
QUADRANT 8C.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.840
HEY, IT WORKED.

18:13.910 --> 18:15.810
NOW COVER 4G AND KING ME.

18:15.880 --> 18:16.910
WHAT?

18:16.980 --> 18:18.350
JUST DO IT.

18:21.050 --> 18:22.120
RIGHT AGAIN.

18:22.190 --> 18:23.550
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

18:23.620 --> 18:25.350
LET'S JUST SAY
SPACE SHRIMP

18:25.420 --> 18:28.590
DOESN'T EXACTLY
PLAY BY THE RULES.

18:49.680 --> 18:52.550
ISN'T THERE SOME OTHER
GAME YOU WANT TO PLAY?

18:52.620 --> 18:55.220
NO. CELESTIAL CHECKERS
IS EVEN MORE FUN

18:55.280 --> 18:57.650
THAN TIC TAC TOE.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.760
OH, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO PLAY CHECKERS,

18:59.820 --> 19:01.490
LEARN THE GAME.

19:03.230 --> 19:05.760
SOMEONE BROUGHT ME A GIFT.

19:05.830 --> 19:07.060
OH, GOODY.

19:07.130 --> 19:10.630
I USUALLY DON'T RECEIVE
MANY GIFTS THIS DEEP IN SPACE.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.800
THERE'S A NOTE.

19:16.770 --> 19:19.780
"PLEASE ACCEPT THIS GIFT
WITH OUR APOLOGIES.

19:19.840 --> 19:22.810
"YOUR FRIENDS AND NOT
YOUR MORTAL ENEMIES,

19:22.880 --> 19:23.980
THE LOONATICS."

19:24.050 --> 19:26.820
HOW NICE.

19:28.380 --> 19:30.450
YES, I BET IT'S ONE
OF THOSE PUZZLE GAMES

19:30.520 --> 19:33.390
THAT YOU TAKE APART AND
CAN NEVER PUT BACK TOGETHER.

19:33.460 --> 19:37.930
OOH, I LOVE PUZZLE GAMES.
COME ALONG, SIRIUS.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.100
SURPRISE.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.030
I ORGANIZED
A RESCUE MISSION TO SAVE YOU.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.500
RIGHT. WAS THAT
BEFORE OR AFTER

19:44.570 --> 19:47.700
YOU PLANNED
TO DIVIDE UP MY THINGS?

19:47.770 --> 19:48.940
UH...

19:49.000 --> 19:50.640
SUPER HEARING, REMEMBER?

19:50.710 --> 19:51.870
HEY. YOU SHOULD
HAVE TO HAVE A WARRANT

19:51.940 --> 19:53.210
TO USE THOSE THINGS.

19:53.280 --> 19:55.210
LOOK, GUYS, I APPRECIATE
YOU COMING,

19:55.280 --> 19:56.610
BUT I CAN'T LEAVE.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.680
I MADE A DEAL TO SAVE
ACMETROPOLIS.

19:58.750 --> 20:01.320
WELL, YOUR LITTLE PLAYMATE
ALREADY BROKE THAT DEAL.

20:01.380 --> 20:03.050
HE SOMEHOW RIGGED
THE CHECKERBOARD

20:03.120 --> 20:04.390
TO HIS WEAPON SYSTEM.

20:04.450 --> 20:06.260
EVERY TIME YOU MAKE A MOVE,

20:06.320 --> 20:09.930
A PART OF ACMETROPOLIS
IS ZAPPED.

20:09.990 --> 20:13.900
WHAT? YOU MEAN I'M DESTROYING
STUFF BY ACCIDENT AGAIN?

20:13.960 --> 20:15.930
OLD HABITS DIE HARD.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.600
TIME TO JET.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.140
TECH, I'M AT
THE SHIPS COMPUTER.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.410
WHAT DO I DO NOW?

20:22.470 --> 20:24.140
LOCATE THE PRIMARY
ENERGY PROCESSOR

20:24.210 --> 20:26.580
AND PHOTON LASER IT
BACK TO HQ.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.580
IF I CAN RECHARGE
THE RECONSTRUCTOR,

20:28.640 --> 20:31.910
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO SAVE ACMETROPOLIS.

20:36.290 --> 20:38.550
UH-HUH. THERE IT IS.

20:48.900 --> 20:49.870
DOWN YOU GO.

20:52.500 --> 20:55.340
ACE, WE'VE GOT PROBLEMS.
LOOK.

20:57.670 --> 20:59.580
THE BOOSTER ROCKET
MUST HAVE BEEN DAMAGED

20:59.640 --> 21:00.610
WHEN WE WERE BROUGHT ABOARD.

21:00.680 --> 21:05.750
WE'LL NEVER GET LIFTOFF.

21:05.810 --> 21:07.280
REV, YOU MEET US
AT THE DOCK BAY, RIGHT...

21:07.350 --> 21:08.550
AWAY.

21:08.620 --> 21:10.050
ENERGY UPLOAD
TO ACMETROPOLIS IS UNDERWAY

21:10.120 --> 21:11.350
AND WILL BE COMPLETED
IN 8 MINUTES OR MAYBE 9 MINUTES

21:11.420 --> 21:12.590
DEPENDING ON
THE SOLAR WINDS,

21:12.660 --> 21:13.790
BUT MY GUESS WOULD
BE 8 MINUTES,

21:13.860 --> 21:15.420
BUT TO BE SAFE,
I WOULD SAY 9 MINUTES.

21:15.490 --> 21:17.560
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
ON THE WAY.

21:17.630 --> 21:20.400
YOU KNOW HOW I LOVE
THOSE LONG RAMBLING STORIES.

21:24.930 --> 21:27.270
THE INTRUDERS.

21:27.340 --> 21:30.370
SOUND THE ALARM,
SERGEANT.

21:32.010 --> 21:35.580
I HAVE A FEELING
THAT'S NOT THE WELCOMING PARTY.

21:38.350 --> 21:40.550
GUARDIANS, DEFEND!

21:44.490 --> 21:45.950
OUCH! OUCH!

21:53.560 --> 21:57.370
INTRUDERS MAKE ME
SO ANGRY.

21:57.430 --> 21:58.530
SO, UH...

21:58.600 --> 22:00.340
WHAT'S UP, DOC?

22:00.400 --> 22:02.340
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

22:02.410 --> 22:06.440
A URANIUM PU-36
EXPLOSIVE SPACE MODULATOR.

22:06.510 --> 22:07.410
NOW TAKE IT.

22:07.480 --> 22:08.540
OH, NO. I WON'T.

22:08.610 --> 22:10.110
OH, YES, YOU WILL.

22:10.180 --> 22:11.450
OH, NO, I WON'T.

22:11.510 --> 22:12.480
OH, YES, YOU WILL.

22:12.550 --> 22:13.450
OH, YES, I WILL.

22:13.520 --> 22:14.750
OH, NO, YOU WON'T.

22:14.820 --> 22:15.520
OH, YES, I WILL!

22:15.580 --> 22:16.890
OH, NO, YOU WON'T.

22:16.950 --> 22:20.160
ALL RIGHT, DOC. YOU WIN.
YOU ALWAYS WIN.

22:20.220 --> 22:21.820
I GUESS I SHOWED HIM.

22:21.890 --> 22:24.660
HE'LL THINK TWICE
BEFORE HE EVER...

22:24.730 --> 22:25.690
HMM. THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

22:26.830 --> 22:29.800
WELL, TWICE, I CAN DO IT
THIS TIME ON PURPOSE.

22:29.870 --> 22:32.470
WHAT? YOU'RE LEAVING
THE FATE OF OUR PLANET

22:32.540 --> 22:34.870
IN THE HANDS OF SOME
JOYSTICK JUGGLER?

22:34.940 --> 22:36.070
YOU GO, BUNNY.

22:36.140 --> 22:38.440
KICK SOME MARTIAN BUTT.

22:51.750 --> 22:53.620
WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE CALLS THAT MOVE?
