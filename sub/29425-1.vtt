00:57.500 --> 01:00.500
- Come on Roy. The storm is coming.
- Race ya!

01:00.500 --> 01:03.500

Sweetie.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.500
- Come on.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.500
<i>Roy.</i>

01:39.500 --> 01:43.500
- <i>Over there?
- Why?</i>

01:45.500 --> 01:47.500
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

02:02.500 --> 02:04.500
Edith!

02:12.500 --> 02:15.500
Edith!

02:17.500 --> 02:19.500
Edith!

02:22.500 --> 02:24.500
Edith!

03:07.500 --> 03:10.500
- Yes!
- Yes, it's ours.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.500
- I love it.
- It's gonna be good? It's gonna be good?

03:13.500 --> 03:16.500
- It's really good.
- Is it gonna be great, okay.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.500
- You're really good.
- I love you so much.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.500
Watch your head.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.500
Come on.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.500
- No cooking, Ben.
- No problem.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.500
My barn!

04:47.500 --> 04:50.500
It's bigger than I thought. Look at this.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.500
This is amazing.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.500
- Alright. Alright.
- We did it, we did it.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.500
This is us doin' it.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.500
- Hello.
- Hello.

05:30.500 --> 05:34.500
I need to thank you for getting me out of that kitchen.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.500
Thank you so much.

05:36.500 --> 05:40.500
This is what we needed. This is just perfect.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.500
Found it in the loft.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.500
Figured a little sandpaper, some varnish, and it'll look...

06:29.500 --> 06:33.500
- No. You leave this guy alone.
- He has so much more character like this.

06:33.500 --> 06:37.500
- Him?
- I thought maybe he could live in here.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.500
Did we do the right thing?

06:41.500 --> 06:47.500
One more year in that restaurant, and we wouldn't even be together.

07:06.500 --> 07:11.500
- Good mornin', Roy.
- Kathy you know what?

07:11.500 --> 07:16.500
I kept thinking to myself, the only thing that's gonna get me through this pisser

07:16.500 --> 07:21.500
of a day is a big, fat piece, of your beautiful blueberry pie.

07:21.500 --> 07:26.500
- Jeez, Roy, we are all out.
- Can I get you a slice of cherry pie?

07:29.500 --> 07:31.500
No, just the milk.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.500
- Sorry Roy.
- Yeah.

07:33.500 --> 07:36.500
Where? Is it on the other side?

07:37.500 --> 07:42.500
- Is it over here?
- Is it...

07:42.500 --> 07:45.500
- Morning.
- Hello.

07:52.500 --> 07:57.500
You the folks who bought the Dondlinger farm?

07:57.500 --> 08:00.500
Yeah. We're still moving in.

08:00.500 --> 08:04.500
Did you know the people who lived there?

08:06.500 --> 08:08.500
I did.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.500
Chicago chef.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.500
- Interior decorator.
- What?

08:18.500 --> 08:22.500
- How did you know?
- It's my job to know.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.500
Boy.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.500
What the...

08:59.500 --> 09:06.500
What the, what the hell is this?

09:08.500 --> 09:10.500
My...

09:26.500 --> 09:29.500
Who the fuck is...

10:00.500 --> 10:04.500
Me and my wife moved in to the Dondlinger farm.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.500
Excuse me?

10:06.500 --> 10:11.500
The Dondlinger farm, it's down the road aways.

10:11.500 --> 10:15.500
This guy's been around the farm, a little bit.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.500
I don't know if you, recognize him or anything.

10:18.500 --> 10:22.500
Maybe you could help me out with that.
I just, it's a blur.

10:22.500 --> 10:27.500
I mean, what you really need to do is learn how to focus your life.

10:27.500 --> 10:33.500
- Think about where you're stepping.
- That's what you really need to focus on.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.500
Let me ask you somethin'.

10:35.500 --> 10:39.500
When you came into this town for the very first time, what did you see?

10:39.500 --> 10:44.500
Nice, quiet town, nice people.

10:44.500 --> 10:48.500
Okay, nice, quiet town, nice, quiet people, that's right,

10:48.500 --> 10:54.500
and that's the way it's gonna stay. And you are a stranger.

10:54.500 --> 11:00.500
You ever hear that, it's a little saying, you can run, but you cannot hide?

11:01.500 --> 11:04.500
Yeah. I'd keep it memorized.

11:39.500 --> 11:44.500
Holy shit!

11:44.500 --> 11:46.500
My God.

11:46.500 --> 11:51.500
I'm sorry. You, you surprised me.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.500
Hello.

11:54.500 --> 11:58.500
- Pretty.
- Very pretty.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.500
This is beautiful.

12:00.500 --> 12:07.500
- I, I see the house before I go.
- The house? Hi, my name is Ben.

12:07.500 --> 12:10.500
I mo, I moved into the house with my wife.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.500
My home.

12:15.500 --> 12:19.500
My home. It's very nice. It's very nice.

12:22.500 --> 12:26.500
- Goodbye to you.
- Goodbye.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.500
May I take your picture?

13:12.500 --> 13:16.500
- When do you think we're gonna move the crib?
- I think it's charming, honey.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.500
I think it's a little creepy.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.500
- No.
- No?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.500
Okay.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.500
- Good night.
- Good night.

13:46.500 --> 13:51.500
- Excuse me. Are you the owner?
- Well, I own the building.

13:51.500 --> 13:54.500
- Hi, I'm Ben Holland.
- Okay.

13:54.500 --> 13:58.500
My background was cooking, but I have a real passion for nature photography.

13:58.500 --> 14:03.500
Moved out here, I'm gonna focus on my photography now.

14:05.500 --> 14:12.500
- Good for you. Where did you move from?
- Chicago. I have some photos here.

14:12.500 --> 14:16.500
I was hoping you would, maybe consider one or two for your gallery.

14:16.500 --> 14:19.500
Yeah, well, this isn't a gallery. This is an artist co-op.

14:19.500 --> 14:23.500
You rent a stall, and you sell 'em yourself.

14:25.500 --> 14:29.500
- These are good.
- Yeah.

14:29.500 --> 14:33.500
I used to live in the city, New York.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.500
What'd you do out there?

14:37.500 --> 14:45.500
Advertising photography, yeah, 25 years, jerking off clients, selling them sports cars, foot creams

14:45.500 --> 14:49.500
and then viral marketing, I got the hell out.

14:49.500 --> 14:56.500
Came back home, teach a few classes, it's really nice, peaceful.

14:57.500 --> 15:02.500
- My wife and I just bought a farm.
- It's beautiful out here.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.500
It's, it's Edith.

15:06.500 --> 15:11.500
What the, what the hell is this?

15:14.500 --> 15:19.500
- You enjoy taking advantage of people?
- Well, no.

15:19.500 --> 15:25.500
- I guess she's part of the land.
- Shut up! Do you think this is funny?

15:25.500 --> 15:30.500
Look, take this, get out! We're done here.

15:30.500 --> 15:33.500
- Excuse me.
- No, we're done here!

15:33.500 --> 15:39.500
- Do you want me to call Roy? Roy?
- He's the sheriff.

15:39.500 --> 15:42.500
The sheriff!

16:51.500 --> 16:55.500
- May I ask you a question?
- Do you know this guy?

16:55.500 --> 16:57.500
No.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.500
Could be Uncle Larry.

17:06.500 --> 17:11.500
- I really like that picture.
- Why you takin' photos of Edith?

17:11.500 --> 17:16.500
I was just taking pictures around the barn, and she showed up.

17:16.500 --> 17:21.500
- What barn?
- My wife and I bought the Dondlinger farm.

17:21.500 --> 17:27.500
Now you listen to me. You stay away, from that poor woman.

17:27.500 --> 17:32.500
Do you have any idea what she's been through?
Do you? You don't even know.

17:32.500 --> 17:37.500
You big city folk, you come in here and make trouble, and you don't care about people.

17:37.500 --> 17:42.500
- Well, we care about people in this town.
- How dare you?

17:51.500 --> 17:55.500
- She vanished in the storm?
- Yeah, it was tragic.

17:55.500 --> 17:59.500
The police, the state patrol, the whole town showed up looking for her.

17:59.500 --> 18:04.500
They searched for days and never found her.
And she was eventually pronounced dead.

18:04.500 --> 18:09.500
Then, 7 years later they find her, wandering down Main Street, in the middle of the night

18:09.500 --> 18:11.500
stark naked, in a trance.

18:11.500 --> 18:17.500
She can't speak.
This, made the state papers.

18:17.500 --> 18:20.500
They eventually had her committed to an asylum.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.500
Rumors were her parents or someone in town abducted her and hid her away

18:24.500 --> 18:27.500
doing God knows what to her all those years.

18:27.500 --> 18:32.500
It was a dark time back then, neighbors suspecting neighbors.

18:32.500 --> 18:40.500
Whoever did this might still be livin' today, on your farm.

19:02.500 --> 19:07.500
My Gosh! My Gosh.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.500
My God.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.500
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.500
- How'd it go?
- What?

19:34.500 --> 19:37.500
- The gallery.
- Yeah.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.500
It went great.

19:39.500 --> 19:43.500
Owner said he was busy, though, so it might be a bit.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.500
- Yeah.
- How are you?

19:46.500 --> 19:49.500
- I'm great, yeah.
- Great.

19:49.500 --> 19:53.500
Alright, I'm gonna go out to the man barn.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.500
- Enjoy.
- Okay.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.500
- I love you. Bye.
- Bye. I love you.

21:32.500 --> 21:37.500
- Well, sweet piggy!
- Look at you, Farmer Brown.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.500
What the hell are you doing out here, you son of a bitch?

21:40.500 --> 21:42.500
Get in the car!

21:42.500 --> 21:45.500
- But I thought you wanted...
- Get in the car!

21:48.500 --> 21:50.500
Car!

21:52.500 --> 21:56.500
- Jeez!
- Come here, what's up?

21:56.500 --> 22:00.500
- Look at you.
- No, no, no, look at you.

22:00.500 --> 22:05.500
Well, I do what I gotta do. I came up to hit a quick 18 with Cal from Bon Appetit.

22:05.500 --> 22:09.500
- You're golfing now?
- Listen, whatever it takes, you know.

22:09.500 --> 22:15.500
- Some of us have real business to tend to.
- Alright.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.500
All the reservations are low.

22:27.500 --> 22:32.500
People won't say it directly, but they miss you.

22:32.500 --> 22:38.500
And I'm trying to make ends meet right now, and it's, it's embarrassing.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.500
It's not the same without you.

22:49.500 --> 22:53.500
Listen, you're a culinary genius. Everybody knows that.

22:53.500 --> 22:57.500
I just couldn't get out of that kitchen, man. It's like 90 hours.

22:57.500 --> 23:01.500
- That's crazy.
- Yeah, but the kitchen, that's where the magic was.

23:01.500 --> 23:05.500
I mean, listen, I'm gonna do whatever it takes to convince you

23:05.500 --> 23:08.500
that's where you need to be.

23:11.500 --> 23:16.500
Lydia! Beautiful as ever.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.500
It was our decision, okay.

23:23.500 --> 23:27.500
- So that's how it is?
- That's how it is, man.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.500
Come on.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.500
I'll see you.

23:41.500 --> 23:45.500
Don't worry. You saved my life.

24:43.500 --> 24:47.500
Hello? Hello!

25:11.500 --> 25:13.500
This isn't funny!

25:27.500 --> 25:30.500
Where are you?

25:34.500 --> 25:36.500
Where are you, man?

25:36.500 --> 25:40.500
Get out here. I saw you.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.500
This isn't funny!

26:01.500 --> 26:03.500
Holy shit.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.500
What the fuck?

26:28.500 --> 26:31.500
What the fuck is going on?

27:25.500 --> 27:29.500
- I told you. I don't want to see you here.
- I'm not here to cause any problems. Listen.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.500
No, I'm not.

27:31.500 --> 27:35.500
I am sorry if I offended you the other day, but I have a photo question.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.500
Right, well...

27:40.500 --> 27:43.500
- Where did you take this?
- At the farm.

27:43.500 --> 27:48.500
- Where on the farm?
- In the field behind the house.

27:51.500 --> 27:55.500
- Now I set the camera up at 1/1000th.
- no, there's no way.

27:55.500 --> 27:58.500
This image was not taken at 1/1000th of a second.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.500
- Why?
- Because it's blurry!

28:00.500 --> 28:04.500
It wouldn't be this blurry, at that fast a shutter speed.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.500
- It would have to be...
- Well, how...

28:06.500 --> 28:09.500
How would you explain this image, if the shutter speed was that fast?

28:09.500 --> 28:13.500
He'd have to be going 100 miles/h, at least.

28:13.500 --> 28:17.500
So you're telling me this is impossible?

28:17.500 --> 28:21.500
You're saying that this image is impossible at that speed?

28:21.500 --> 28:25.500
Yeah, yeah, it's impossible! You made a mistake.

28:27.500 --> 28:30.500
You made a mistake!

28:32.500 --> 28:37.500
<i>¶ Me ¶
¶ My God ¶</i>

28:43.500 --> 28:48.500
<i>¶ Me ¶
¶ My God ¶</i>

31:06.500 --> 31:08.500
- Ben, you promised.
- No, no, baby.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.500
You weren't in our bed last night.

31:11.500 --> 31:15.500
- I was working.
- You promised.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.500
Lydia, wait. Wait.

31:57.500 --> 32:01.500
- You okay?
- I'm just tired, alright?

32:01.500 --> 32:07.500
- Yeah, I'm familiar with that line.
- What's that supposed to mean?

32:07.500 --> 32:09.500
Nothing.

32:14.500 --> 32:21.500
- Just take it easy, chef.
- I moved out here for you, didn't I?

32:21.500 --> 32:23.500
What else do you want from me?

33:12.500 --> 33:18.500
I haven't been completely honest with you.
I need to show you something.

33:24.500 --> 33:27.500
- He's gone.
- He's there.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.500
He's gone.

33:29.500 --> 33:33.500
I have no idea what I'm looking at.

33:33.500 --> 33:36.500
Him. Look.

33:38.500 --> 33:41.500
- He's not there.
- He's there.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.500
Then he's not.

33:43.500 --> 33:49.500
I took those pictures a second apart, Lydia.
I can't explain it. I...

33:49.500 --> 33:54.500
This is what kept me in the barn last night.
Lydia.

33:54.500 --> 33:58.500
I think it's, I think it's a ghost.

34:00.500 --> 34:04.500
- Can we just be serious, honey?
- I'm, I am serious.

34:04.500 --> 34:08.500
- I'll prove it to you.
- Come on.

34:08.500 --> 34:11.500
We're gonna go out in the field. I'm gonna show this to you.

34:11.500 --> 34:13.500
Come on!

34:15.500 --> 34:18.500
It's not there, I... Shit!

34:21.500 --> 34:25.500
I don't know why it's not working, but...

34:25.500 --> 34:29.500
- Come on Ben, it's getting cold.
- Just, just wait, okay.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.500
Shit.

34:34.500 --> 34:41.500
I don't know why it's not working, but there is something odd out there in that field.

34:41.500 --> 34:44.500
- Ben. Ben!
- What?

34:44.500 --> 34:49.500
I haven't been entirely honest with you either.

35:00.500 --> 35:03.500
That's the guy from the gallery.

35:06.500 --> 35:11.500
- I hope we did the right thing.
- We'll be okay.

36:02.500 --> 36:05.500
- The sheriff's here.
- What?

36:07.500 --> 36:09.500
Come on.

36:14.500 --> 36:17.500
- Good morning.
- Morning, Sheriff.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.500
- Ben, ma'am.
- How you doing?

36:20.500 --> 36:23.500
Folks have some real pretty dirt out here.

36:23.500 --> 36:28.500
- Thinkin' about doin' any farmin'?
- I doubt it.

36:28.500 --> 36:32.500
- We just, like the space.
- It's, it's nice to be able to spread out.

36:32.500 --> 36:36.500
Well, what made you consider Manitowoc County?

36:39.500 --> 36:43.500
We just found the town to be, omfortable.

36:45.500 --> 36:50.500
- Can we do something for you, Sheriff?
- Yeah, Ben I got to ask you a question.

36:50.500 --> 36:55.500
What were you doin' with Edith Millard out there, in that field the other day?

36:55.500 --> 36:59.500
I was just out there taking some photos, and she walked...

36:59.500 --> 37:02.500
- Yeah, George told me that.
- Kathy said you came in and talked to her.

37:02.500 --> 37:06.500
Charlotte Waite said you were in the library,  lookin' up all the old stories about her.

37:06.500 --> 37:08.500
Now what's that all about?

37:08.500 --> 37:14.500
Well, I just heard things, and I wanted to find out what the big deal was.

37:14.500 --> 37:19.500
Yeah, well the big deal is Edith Millard spent most of her adult life in a sanitarium

37:19.500 --> 37:21.500
alright, in Windy Ridge.

37:21.500 --> 37:25.500
Now she lives peaceful, quiet and safe in that little cottage by the edge of your property

37:25.500 --> 37:29.500
back by the old field out there, and that's the way we like it.

37:29.500 --> 37:33.500
Everybody in town likes it that way, and we want to keep it that way.

37:33.500 --> 37:38.500
So don't come in here thinking you can publicize her story, just to make a quick buck, alright?

37:38.500 --> 37:40.500
Are you accusing me of something?

37:40.500 --> 37:44.500
Listen, people in this town went through hell, when that little girl disappeared.

37:44.500 --> 37:49.500
Some of those folks are still here and their kids and their grandkids.

37:49.500 --> 37:56.500
You've been warned, son. No more of this Edith Millard nonsense.

37:56.500 --> 38:02.500
- Don't make me come back out here.
- I just took her picture.

38:04.500 --> 38:06.500
I...

38:48.500 --> 38:51.500
What are you doing?

39:00.500 --> 39:06.500
What are your secrets for apple pie? Do you have any?

39:06.500 --> 39:08.500
Son of a bitch!

39:09.500 --> 39:13.500
You leave Edith alone.

39:15.500 --> 39:18.500
I haven't done anything to Edith.

40:23.500 --> 40:28.500
I'll get you some cough drops for your cough.

40:31.500 --> 40:34.500
They taste good, too.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.500
Wanna hold hands?

41:28.500 --> 41:31.500
Hit it hard.

41:33.500 --> 41:35.500
Shut up!

41:40.500 --> 41:42.500
Come on, go, go!

41:49.500 --> 41:54.500
Run fast! Run hard, down the well, with Edith Millard.

41:54.500 --> 42:07.500
Run fast, run hard, down the well, with Edith Millard!

42:09.500 --> 42:12.500
Down the well with Edith Millard!

42:12.500 --> 42:15.500
- Edith!
- Down the well with Edith Millard!

42:15.500 --> 42:19.500
Run fast, run hard, down the well with Edith Millard.

42:39.500 --> 42:42.500
Pretty sure you're breaking the law.

42:43.500 --> 42:47.500
A lot of folks would love to know what you're doing out here.

42:47.500 --> 42:50.500
I would like to know, what you're doing out here.

43:04.500 --> 43:08.500
- How much do you know about this place?
- Not much.

43:08.500 --> 43:12.500
The more I find out about it, the weirder it gets, though.

43:12.500 --> 43:14.500
What do you mean weird?

43:14.500 --> 43:18.500
Well, I found out what happened to Edith, and the sheriff.

43:18.500 --> 43:22.500
And I'm taking pictures of people that aren't there.

43:27.500 --> 43:32.500
What do you mean? Who's that, and who's that and that and that?

43:32.500 --> 43:35.500
Well, one second, I'll take a picture with nothing.

43:35.500 --> 43:41.500
The next picture I take, someone's there.
And then the second after that, they're gone.

43:46.500 --> 43:49.500
Don't mention this to Roy.

43:53.500 --> 44:01.500
There's a lot of memories out here, some good ones, bad ones.

44:01.500 --> 44:04.500
I made a few myself.

44:05.500 --> 44:10.500
- If I was you, I would stop it.
- I'm just taking pictures.

44:10.500 --> 44:14.500
I said if I were you, I'd stop it.

44:26.500 --> 44:31.500
I'm not calling about work, Kenny.
I need you to be straight with me, man.

44:31.500 --> 44:34.500
Are you playing a joke on me?

44:36.500 --> 44:40.500
Are you playing a practical joke on me, you know, to get me back to Chicago?

44:40.500 --> 44:45.500
Because I gotta tell you, it's, it's not funny anymore, man.

44:45.500 --> 44:49.500
<i>Now what's up? What's going on?</i>

44:49.500 --> 44:57.500
You're not messing with my camera, you know, putting images there that shouldn't be?

45:00.500 --> 45:02.500
<i>No, I'm not playing any games.</i>

45:02.500 --> 45:06.500
Let me just make this clear. I am not coming back.

45:06.500 --> 45:10.500
But if you are messing with me, man, I'm taking the next fuckin' train down there

45:10.500 --> 45:13.500
and I'm gonna kick your ass.

45:20.500 --> 45:25.500
- It's not funny, man!
- This ends now, got it?

45:28.500 --> 45:32.500
Well, the site of your farm is where the original Fort Jackson stood.

45:32.500 --> 45:38.500
It was built for the Black Hawk War in 1832.
But lots of strange things happened there.

45:38.500 --> 45:41.500
- Like what?
- Well, here's my favorite story.

45:41.500 --> 45:50.500
In your field, there was a deep, deep well, and people fell down and never were found.

45:50.500 --> 45:54.500
Actually, they thought Edith Millard fell down the well.

45:54.500 --> 46:01.500
But get this, Roy was the last person to see her before she disappeared, and as a young officer

46:01.500 --> 46:03.500
the first one to find her.

46:03.500 --> 46:06.500
- Well, what a coincidence.
- Yeah.

46:06.500 --> 46:09.500
No, people do not like that guy.

46:38.500 --> 46:41.500
- Yeah.
- What's that?

46:43.500 --> 46:49.500
It's a high- speed video camera that can take over 1,500 frames per second.

46:49.500 --> 46:53.500
- You paid how much?
- I can return this.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.500
<i>¶ Alright ¶</i>

49:49.500 --> 49:52.500
- My name's Lydia.
- Yes.

49:59.500 --> 50:01.500
Thank you.

50:07.500 --> 50:11.500
Ben tells me you used to live in our house.

50:13.500 --> 50:18.500
I need to be near my home. My family.

50:19.500 --> 50:22.500
We're not going to ask you to leave.

50:27.500 --> 50:30.500
My family waits for me.

50:30.500 --> 50:35.500
- Always waits for me.
- Where is your family?

50:39.500 --> 50:49.500
My home, in the field, my home.
My family waits for me.

50:55.500 --> 50:58.500
Ben and I are hoping to start a family.

51:22.500 --> 51:26.500
- Goodbye to you.
- Goodbye.

51:26.500 --> 51:32.500
I wonder if I could, I wonder if I could come back sometime?

51:32.500 --> 51:35.500
- Yes, goodbye to you.
- Goodbye.

51:35.500 --> 51:37.500
Thank you.

51:53.500 --> 51:56.500
- What's going on?
- Where were you?

51:56.500 --> 52:01.500
I was just, I saw Edith. I ran into Edith.
I need you to come see this.

52:01.500 --> 52:03.500
- Come on.
- Are you okay?

52:03.500 --> 52:05.500
- Yeah.
- Okay.

52:05.500 --> 52:09.500
So I took the camera, and set it up to take 1,500 frames a second.

52:09.500 --> 52:14.500
Then I went through the frames and took out each one with him in it, and I set them up

52:14.500 --> 52:17.500
in a sequence. Now watch.

52:23.500 --> 52:26.500
Just look at that.

52:27.500 --> 52:31.500
- Is this an animation?
- No, it's real.

53:14.500 --> 53:16.500
Scone.

53:18.500 --> 53:21.500
I brought you something else, too.

53:23.500 --> 53:26.500
It's from Ben.

53:35.500 --> 53:37.500
That's you, Edith.

53:39.500 --> 53:41.500
That's you.

53:45.500 --> 53:48.500
No Edith.

53:49.500 --> 53:51.500
Joonica.

53:53.500 --> 53:57.500
Joonica. Joonica.

54:00.500 --> 54:03.500
Not from here.

54:03.500 --> 54:07.500
I'm sorry. What do you mean you're not from here?

54:11.500 --> 54:14.500
I go home.

54:16.500 --> 54:19.500
Family waiting. My family.

54:21.500 --> 54:23.500
Joonica.

54:23.500 --> 54:26.500
What's in the field?

54:28.500 --> 54:31.500
Big storm.

54:31.500 --> 54:35.500
Big storm, Joonica go home.

54:48.500 --> 54:53.500
Ben, we need to tell someone about this.
I think we should get more footage.

54:53.500 --> 54:57.500
More footage? I mean, how much more footage could you possibly get?

54:57.500 --> 55:00.500
We don't know what this is.

55:09.500 --> 55:11.500
Well, maybe it's not for us to figure out.

55:11.500 --> 55:14.500
I mean, maybe we should contact a scientist or something.

55:14.500 --> 55:17.500
Look at this, it's even clearer than the other ones.

55:17.500 --> 55:19.500
- Ben!
- Lydia.

55:19.500 --> 55:22.500
- This is overwhelming.
- We are on something big here.

55:22.500 --> 55:26.500
- This could be enormous for us, Lydia.
- A haunted farm?

55:26.500 --> 55:30.500
- It's not haunted.
- You're safe here.

55:30.500 --> 55:33.500
- Then why was the sheriff here?
- The sheriff's an asshole.

55:33.500 --> 55:35.500
- Ben.
- Listen!

55:35.500 --> 55:40.500
We shouldn't go jumping to conclusions, until we know what we have here.

55:40.500 --> 55:43.500
You know, Ben, this is just like Chicago.

55:43.500 --> 55:46.500
Long nights, late hours, we're not sleeping together.

55:46.500 --> 55:51.500
This is Chicago? This right here is Chicago?

55:51.500 --> 55:57.500
You're being ridiculous! I can't even believe you right now.

58:04.500 --> 58:06.500
Ben!

58:58.500 --> 59:01.500
Hello?

59:01.500 --> 59:10.500
Children? Where are you? I can't see you, come here! Kids!

59:14.500 --> 59:17.500
There you are.

59:58.500 --> 01:00:04.500
I'm so sorry about last night. Honey, I'm sorry.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:09.500
I'm sorry we're stuck with this place. It's my fault.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:15.500
- No, it's, it's not your fault.
- We made a deal.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:23.500
- I forced you.
- You didn't force me. You saved me.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:28.500
- You're saving our marriage.
- You gave up a career, too.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.500
- I can't...
- Yeah.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.500
I can't lose you.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:38.500
I won't ever let anything happen to you. I promise.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:42.500
Me and the baby would never forgive you.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.500
When we have a baby.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:57.500
- Ben.
- What's this?

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.500
This isn't more cameras, is it?

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:08.500
No, no, it's, some lights, some stands, stuff we need. Stuff we need.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.500
Aren't you a little old to be hanging around with teenagers?

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:37.500
Look, kids these days, especially in these times, they need a role model.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:48.500
I'll tell you somethin' about the singular point of view of the celestial spear.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:53.500
- God.
- Yeah, it's watchin' you, from above.

01:01:53.500 --> 01:02:02.500
It sees you, and it sees what's inside of you, and you yourself have a spear

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.500
and it's full.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:11.500
It's full, but you've got to let the air out, because love's got to come in.

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:16.500
That's something you ain't got.
That's something that you need.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:20.500
And the celestial spear will give that to you.

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:28.500
- Have a seat, milady.
- There you are.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:34.500
- Behold, my biggest fan.
- Alright.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:41.500
What if I could tell you I could freeze time, with this and this alone?

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:46.500
Behold. The fan is spinning at a very fast speed, and I will stop it.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:54.500
Look at that. At the right frequencies, I can also set this to mimic a camera shutter

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:58.500
speed of 1/1000th of a second, therefore being  able to see things

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:02.500
that you would not normally see with the naked eye.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:07.500
No more dragging cameras out into the field, never needing to sift through thousands of photos

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:14.500
and just me, my naked eye, find whatever's out there?

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.500
What?

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.500
Shit!

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:59.500
- Ben! Ben, come inside! Come inside right now!
- Calm down. Lydia.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:03.500
- Come with me right now. I saw them.
- Calm down. What did you see?

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.500
- Turn that off.
- I didn't see!

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.500
- What did you see? What is it?
- Lock the doors!

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:12.500
-  Lydia, Lydia.
- I saw something.

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:15.500
- What did you see?
- I don't know.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.500
- I don't know.
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:21.500
We're okay. I'm right here.

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.500
Look at me. Look at me.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:27.500
- Come here.
- Ben, I'm so scared.

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:29.500
- Lydia.
- Honey.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:31.500
- It's okay.
- I can't have anything happen to you.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:35.500
- I love you so much.
- I won't let anything happen to you.

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.500
Come here.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:41.500
- Come here.
- Calm down.

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.500
- Ben.
- What?

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.500
We should set up over there.

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.500
Okay.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.500
Joonica.

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:37.500
Is this you as a girl?

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.500
No, no Joonica.

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:48.500
- This isn't you as a baby?
- No.

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.500
You had family?

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.500
You had baby.

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:19.500
It's coming. It's coming!

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.500
- Alright, Ben, come on.
- Just one more minute.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.500
- Come on.
- No, let's go inside.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:31.500
- I'm almost set.
- Ben, listen to me. Look, it's gonna storm.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.500
- Come on.
- This is what we need.

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:37.500
- It's getting dangerous.
- Joonica, come on, we're gonna go inside.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.500
Joonica wait! Joonica!

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:58.500
Lydia. Lydia?

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.500
Lydia.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:19.500
Lydia! Where are you? Where are you? Lydia, answer me!

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:29.500
Lydia! Lydia! Lydia, answer me! Lydia!

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.500
Dammit!

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:07.500
Ben! Ben!

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:11.500
Ben, I'm over here! Ben!

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:15.500
- Ben, I'm over here!
- It's beautiful.

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:18.500
Beautiful.

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.500
Ben, Ben! Ben, please, Ben!

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:26.500
Ben!

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:49.500
- What do you want?
- Where is she?

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.500
Who?

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:59.500
We found Edith's coat in that field there with your generators, and your cables

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.500
and your crap.

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:07.500
- Now what the hell did you do with her?
- I didn't do anything.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:10.500
You know, you are one shitty liar, son.

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:14.500
- You want to try again?
- I don't know.

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.500
- What?
- I don't know!

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:21.500
- What?
- I didn't do anything to her!

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:25.500
Yeah, we'll, we'll just see about that.

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:47.500
- House is clean, Roy.
- Check the barn.

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:55.500
You mind telling me why the wife has been gone so long?

01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:02.500
- She went to her parents house.
- We've been having problems.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:06.500
If you're having problems, why'd you buy the farm?

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:13.500
I thought it might fix things. Things don't fix things. People fix things.

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.500
Nothing.

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:25.500
I'm gonna tell you this just one time.

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:30.500
If anything happened to Edith, I will kill you.

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:35.500
And don't think I won't. And don't think I can't.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.500
I got a badge, and I got a gun.

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:42.500
People hang themselves in jail cells all the time.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:48.500
Get the fuck off of my car. Now!

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:17.500
Okay, Friday, October 15th, 8:15PM, interview with one Benjamin Holland

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:20.500
in regards to the disappearance of Edith Millard.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:23.500
You're comfortable, mr. Holland?
You need anything, water, coffee?

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.500
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:30.500
Alright, mr. Holland, when was the last time you saw Edith Millard?

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.500
- 5 days ago.
- 5 days, that'd make it about October 10th?

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.500
- Yes.
- And what time of day was that?

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:39.500
It was in the afternoon like 4, 5 o'clock maybe.

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:42.500
4 or 5, so we're talking late afternoon, early evening?

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:44.500
Yes.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:47.500
We found an article of clothing of hers, out in your field, a jacket.

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:51.500
Was she wearing that jacket at the time you saw her on October 10th?

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.500
I don't recall. She visits us a lot.

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:56.500
And does she wear the jacket when she visits you?

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.500
- You don't know?
- Yes and no.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:01.500
- But you didn't see it at the time?
- I don't recall.
-

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:06.500
People have been saying they've been seeing some strange lights, flashing things

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:09.500
out in your field, last couple of nights.

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:14.500
Can you explain that? I'm taking specialized night photography.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:18.500
I didn't realize it was illegal. Well, not yet.

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.500
Where's your wife?

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:33.500
- She went to her folks house.
- Where would that be?

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:37.500
- Chicago.
- Expect her back?

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.500
I hope so.

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:49.500
Okay, let's back it up here. The last time you saw Edith Millard was roughly

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:53.500
October 10th, between 4 and 5 p.m. in the afternoon?

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:55.500
- Yes.

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:59.500
You don't recall whether she was wearing a jacket that we found in the field?

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:02.500
I don't. Or whether she was carrying it when you saw her.

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:06.500
I don't. I don't know if she was wearing it or carrying it. I don't know.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:13.500
- How many times do I need to tell you?
- Alright. I think we've heard enough.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:21.500
I'm gonna advise you not to leave town.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.500
Lydia?

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.500
I am so sorry.

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.500
I...

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:43.500
I don't understand.

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:48.500
Lydia.

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:53.500
Please, please come back.

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:55.500
Ben Holland, you are under arrest in connection, with the disappearance of Edith Millard

01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:57.500
and Lydia Holland.

01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:00.500
- Here, cuff him.
- Wait, wait, I can explain.

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:02.500
You have the right to remain silent.

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:05.500
Roy, I can tell you, what happened that night that Edith disappeared.

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:09.500
I know there was a storm.
There was a storm the night she disappeared.

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:11.500
- Yeah.
- I know, I know you're not responsible.

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:13.500
- If you do not...
- I have proof! I can show you.

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:17.500
In the barn, I can show you right now.
I could show you that I know what happened.

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.500
Alright.

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.500
- Dammit, let go.
- What?

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.500
What is it you think you can show me?

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:27.500
The more and more I worked on it, finally I figured out

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:30.500
that not all the frames show what's happening.

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:35.500
You can't just watch the whole picture.
It moves too fast.

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:39.500
But if you go frame to frame, that you can't look at everything.

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:43.500
And that's what it is, because it's just impossible to see it.

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:47.500
But when the lightning strikes, and it knocked out all the power.

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:49.500
What is it you're showing me?

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:52.500
I'm showing you this is, the footage that was left on the camera

01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.500
before the lightning strikes.

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:57.500
Ben, what is it you're showin' me?

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:14.500
Ben what is this?

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:21.500
What am I supposed to be watchin' here, Ben?

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:24.500
- The fuck is he doing?
- He's fuckin' nuts is what it is.

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:27.500
Let's take him in now.

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:38.500
Just work. Yeah.

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:45.500
That's it, take him.

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:48.500
- Come on. Mr. Holland, mr. Holland!
- Stay back!

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.500
- Step away from the machine!
- Do not, no!

01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:53.500
- What's going on here?
- Don't you, what are you doing?

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:55.500
Get off me!

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.500
- Hang on, I got him.
- Get off me!

01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:00.500
Turn that thing off, will ya? I can't see anything.

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:03.500
- What are you doing?
- Better shut up!

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:06.500
Will ya turn that mother...

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.500
Lydia!

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:35.500
- Lydia.
- Ben, it's you?

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.500
- It's you!
- Yeah, it's me.

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:41.500
- My God.
- It's alright.

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:44.500
I thought I lost you.

01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.500
Hello Roy.

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:03.500
My God. How are you, Roy?

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:07.500
- It's me, Roy.
- Edith?

01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:11.500
- Is it really you?
- Yes.

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:23.500
- Is it you?
- Yeah.

01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:25.500
- Is it really you, is it?
- Yeah.

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:29.500
My God. You're so beautiful.

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:36.500
I never want to let you go.
I never want to let you go again.

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:40.500
Let's go home.

01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:42.500
- Can we go home?
- Yeah.

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:45.500
- Yeah, let's go home.
- Yeah.

01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:06.500
And look at you.

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:09.500
- Yeah, yeah.
- You're a sheriff now.

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:14.500
Yeah, There's so much. So good to see you.

01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:18.500
We should sell this farm.

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:22.500
Get away from the field and just start over.

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:25.500
- No.
- This is the right place, Ben.

01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:29.500
- Are you sure?
- I'm pregnant.

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:36.500
- Really? How do you know?
- I saw our daughter.

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:18.500
- You're alright?
- See?

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:28.500
- Let's take a picture.
- It's picture time!

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:31.500
- What'd you say?
- What is here?

01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:35.500
There you go. We're gonna get a picture.

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:38.500
My goodness.

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:43.500
Get up, make sure you got that food in your mouth, right?

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:46.500
Yeah, yes, yes.

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:51.500
- Ready?
- Okay.

01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:56.500
- Who's ready?
- Take a picture.

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:04.500
Alright.

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:09.500
Come on.

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:12.500
This is gonna be great.
