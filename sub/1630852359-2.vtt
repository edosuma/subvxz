[inhales]

00:45.979 --> 00:47.581
[grunts]

01:10.838 --> 01:12.673
[hooves approaching]

02:35.356 --> 02:38.192
[metal clanking]

02:38.259 --> 02:40.060
[music]

02:53.641 --> 02:54.742
- Captain.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.156
[sigh]

03:12.360 --> 03:14.395
[stammers]

03:16.964 --> 03:17.998
- I know.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.703
I know.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.141
[sobbing]

04:03.243 --> 04:05.212
Elsa: My father won't
speak of the war.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.850
When men ask if he fought,
he says no.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.588
I've seen fellow soldiers call
out his name on the street.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.825
He turns and walks
the other way.

04:21.395 --> 04:24.965
He spent three years
in a Union prison.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.735
When he came home,
my mother said

04:27.801 --> 04:29.737
he weighed ninety-seven pounds.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.774
[music]

06:02.062 --> 06:04.798
[music]

06:48.476 --> 06:50.143
- Gonna need a cook.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.211
Or two.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.780
- Why do we need a cook?

06:52.846 --> 06:55.048
- Because your passengers are
feasting like it's Christmas

06:55.115 --> 06:56.584
and somebody needs
to ration their food

06:56.650 --> 06:59.286
because when they run out,
they're coming after my food.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.854
Or your food...

07:00.921 --> 07:03.691
- We're gonna bring
a herd of beef with us.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.258
Food ain't gonna be a problem.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.427
- Yeah, it will.

07:07.495 --> 07:09.162
Add a cook to the list.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.166
You feel like moving some cows?

07:14.568 --> 07:16.637
- Somebody's gotta watch
after these folks.

07:16.704 --> 07:20.173
- If these folks can't survive
six hours sitting by a river,

07:20.240 --> 07:21.575
I'd rather know it now.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.177
[sigh]

07:29.583 --> 07:31.084
- What are you looking at?

07:31.151 --> 07:32.720
- Nuthin'.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.828
- How come I ain't got no hair?

07:42.596 --> 07:44.798
- "Ain't got no"?

07:44.865 --> 07:48.001
Been in Texas six days,
you already forgot how to speak.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.570
- How come?

07:49.637 --> 07:51.238
- You will.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.643
When you're older.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.245
- But how come not now?

07:58.311 --> 08:00.581
- I don't know
"how come not now."

08:00.648 --> 08:03.851
Maybe 'cause it makes
you easier to tickle.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.786
[laughing]

08:07.287 --> 08:08.488
James: Elsa.

08:13.794 --> 08:15.395
Where's your mother?

08:16.429 --> 08:18.398
- Don't know.

08:18.465 --> 08:20.167
- We're going to go
round up some cattle.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.201
Be back in the afternoon.

08:21.268 --> 08:22.435
I want you to stay in camp,

08:22.502 --> 08:23.871
I want you to keep
an eye on your brother,

08:23.937 --> 08:25.873
and don't wander off.

08:27.274 --> 08:28.475
All right.

08:29.910 --> 08:33.681
[music]

09:06.379 --> 09:11.484
- Cool air rises from the ground
and sends a shiver through me.

09:11.551 --> 09:15.088
Then the sun finds my face,
and I am warm.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.526
The world here plays parlor
tricks on your senses...

09:21.461 --> 09:25.065
I do not know what
the word "Texas" means.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.433
But to me it means magic.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.242
- Look, these here cattle,

09:35.308 --> 09:36.509
they're going to Kansas

09:36.576 --> 09:38.345
unless you can
pay Kansas prices.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.147
- What are Kansas prices?

09:40.213 --> 09:41.615
- Hell, you can get
forty dollars a head

09:41.682 --> 09:42.950
for these sons
of bitches up there.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.285
Those New Yorkers
sure do love their steaks.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.854
- We can't pay that.

09:46.920 --> 09:51.224
- Well, I don't blame you.
I wouldn't either.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.727
I tell you what,
I'll put a bee in your bonnet.

09:53.794 --> 09:56.029
There's still wild cattle
down there on the Brazos,

09:56.096 --> 09:58.098
if you got the stones
to go get 'em.

09:58.165 --> 10:01.268
- We got the stones,
we just don't have the men.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.071
- We could saddle up some
of them wagon horses,

10:04.137 --> 10:05.839
stick them Germans on them.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.708
Surely they can hold a line.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.243
- Don't bet on it.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.546
[horse neighs]

10:13.613 --> 10:15.448
- Let's put them in the sell
barn, lot four.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.728
Ain't changed
our mind yet, Captain.

10:27.795 --> 10:30.397
- We're going to round some up.
Can I hire you for that?

10:30.463 --> 10:31.765
- Where you holding 'em?

10:31.832 --> 10:34.234
- Ain't found them to hold them.
- Hm.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.803
You hunting wild cattle?

10:35.869 --> 10:39.139
- I'll give you a dollar apiece
for every one you gather.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.774
- How many you trying
to get together?

10:40.841 --> 10:42.275
- Hundred or so.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.111
- You need ten hands.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.746
And I mean good hands.

10:45.813 --> 10:49.016
- How 'bout three good hands and
twenty who ain't worth a shit.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.650
- If they ain't worth a shit

10:50.718 --> 10:52.720
we ain't gonna get nuthin'
and we ain't gonna get paid.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.187
- I'll pay you
ten dollars apiece

10:54.254 --> 10:55.823
whether we wrangle any or not.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.162
- You're wasting your money.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.697
- Aw, come on, Wade.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.498
You're handy enough
for all of us.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.970
- Yeah, there's still some wild
cattle around Fort Griffith.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.872
That's a pretty
good ride though.

11:11.939 --> 11:14.742
- We're ready when you are.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.144
- Yee-haw. [clicks tongue]
- Yee-haw.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.279
- Come on, boys, y'all
got cattle to sort, let's go.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.081
- We'll be back for them
cattle, don't you worry.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.315
Hya!
[clicks tongue]

11:24.885 --> 11:29.990
[music]

11:31.859 --> 11:35.362
- It seems even trees
are new to this place.

11:35.428 --> 11:38.665
They scatter about in clusters,
like little villages...

11:41.701 --> 11:43.837
And everywhere, treasures.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.673
Everywhere there
is a bounty

11:46.740 --> 11:48.475
just waiting
to be scooped up...

12:23.310 --> 12:24.444
[gasps]

12:30.017 --> 12:33.120
When I looked
out over this land,

12:33.186 --> 12:35.856
I only saw the freedom
it promised.

12:37.490 --> 12:41.294
I knew nothing of the horror
that hides in freedom's shadow.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.032
[gasps]

12:50.270 --> 12:51.538
[groaning, vomiting]

13:01.114 --> 13:03.450
[sighs]

13:11.091 --> 13:12.159
- Let me see 'em

13:17.097 --> 13:18.966
[sigh]

13:19.032 --> 13:20.267
Put them in the pot.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.141
[sighs]
Fools.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.449
- I'm going to go warn him
- Don't bother.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.351
Better they die up here

13:38.418 --> 13:40.587
than do something on
the trail that gets us killed.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.456
Only cure for stupid is
reaching the gates of heaven.

13:43.523 --> 13:47.394
- Funny, I don't recall the word
"stupid" anywhere in the Bible.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.665
[panting]

13:52.732 --> 13:54.701
- Look what
the cat drug to camp.

13:54.767 --> 13:59.106
- Across the river...
People...

13:59.172 --> 14:01.041
Nausea has a number
of them to their knees.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.012
- You were across the river?

14:06.246 --> 14:08.248
Your dress is dry,
so you didn't swim.

14:08.315 --> 14:11.418
Either you learned how to fly

14:11.484 --> 14:13.186
or you rode the back
of one of those Germans.

14:13.253 --> 14:16.589
I don't know which image
is more upsetting.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.591
- There's a sand bar.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.393
And a log.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.029
- Mystery solved then.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.070
They don't even boil it.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.372
Just drink it like
it's from a faucet.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.607
Cholera will run
the lot of them.

14:35.675 --> 14:36.977
- What's my mother doing?

14:38.811 --> 14:43.316
- She's wasting her time.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.985
- I'm done with berries.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.653
Your turn.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.355
Mind the thorns.

14:49.689 --> 14:53.893
[music]

14:59.699 --> 15:01.401
- Don't see any saddle horses.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.704
- I've got a few.

15:04.771 --> 15:06.439
- Got a few saddles, too?

15:06.506 --> 15:09.542
These sons of bitches
are plow drivers.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.178
- We warned you.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.347
- Hell, we're better
off without 'em.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.049
- Can any of 'em ride?

15:16.116 --> 15:18.251
- I got one can ride.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.720
[clicks tongue]

15:27.460 --> 15:28.728
[crying]

15:35.068 --> 15:37.270
- It's the water.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.739
You have to boil it
before you drink it.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.574
[speaks German]

15:41.641 --> 15:43.210
Don't drink it.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.544
[groans]

15:54.254 --> 15:55.888
[cries]

16:01.061 --> 16:02.495
- Go saddle Lightning.

16:02.562 --> 16:05.498
- She's sick.
From the water.

16:05.565 --> 16:06.699
They all are.

16:08.935 --> 16:09.969
- Go saddle Lightning.

16:11.404 --> 16:14.541
[groaning]

16:30.157 --> 16:31.591
You making them tea?

16:31.658 --> 16:33.860
- These poor people
don't know to boil water.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.329
- I'll be gone
'till tomorrow late.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.431
- Be careful.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.567
- Shotgun's under the
buckboard if there's trouble.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.569
- [laughs] I have Claire
if there's trouble.

16:42.635 --> 16:45.004
- Claire usually
makes things worse.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.939
I'm taking Elsa...

16:47.006 --> 16:48.441
- You're what?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.243
- This bunch is short
on riders and we need her.

16:52.912 --> 16:56.216
- I'd object, but it sounds like
you're not asking my permission.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.151
- No, ma'am, I am not.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.819
- How am I supposed
to make her a lady

16:59.886 --> 17:02.389
when you keep treating her
like a man?

17:02.455 --> 17:03.856
- Plenty of ladies
in this world.

17:03.923 --> 17:06.059
Pretty short
on decent men, though.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.327
[clicks tongue]

17:07.394 --> 17:09.596
- How am I supposed
to respond to that?

17:20.840 --> 17:22.242
- Sun'll be fierce.

17:27.013 --> 17:29.682
- [laughs]
It'll blow off.

17:32.752 --> 17:33.753
- Here, tie it down.

17:42.262 --> 17:43.630
- What's that for?

17:43.696 --> 17:45.132
- Not sure.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.867
But I'd sure hate you don't
have it when we find out.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.503
Stay close to me.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.606
[chuckles]

17:57.577 --> 17:58.911
[music]

18:46.226 --> 18:48.027
- They're back early.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.396
- Yep.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.797
Shea: Who are they?

18:52.732 --> 18:54.267
- A stroke of luck
there, Captain.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.606
[clicks tongue]

19:17.790 --> 19:19.359
- Goddamn, Wade.

19:19.426 --> 19:22.028
If there's a better way
to get shot I don't know it,

19:22.094 --> 19:25.232
chargin' in here like a
bunch of fucking bandits.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.833
[chuckles]

19:26.899 --> 19:29.569
- We've seen you shoot, Grady.
I think the bandits are safe.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.137
- Y'all hunting strays?

19:31.204 --> 19:33.606
- Wild ones. Seen any?

19:33.673 --> 19:35.107
- Yeah, some.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.044
Them wild bulls pester them
English cows pretty good.

19:38.110 --> 19:40.580
Must be the way they smell.

19:40.647 --> 19:43.650
All smell the same to me,
but I ain't a bull.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.952
- Your crew's pretty light
to gather wild cattle.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.821
- Could use the help.
We'll pay.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.624
- No need.
We need to clear some out.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.560
Y'all best come on up to camp.

19:57.230 --> 19:58.765
- Come on.

19:58.831 --> 20:02.402
[music]

20:05.204 --> 20:07.073
- Good to see you, Wade.

20:07.139 --> 20:09.276
Almost fucking shot you.
- [laughing]

20:17.884 --> 20:20.052
- Whoo, yeah,
I got you one.

20:20.119 --> 20:22.221
- What you got here?

20:22.289 --> 20:23.756
- I bet you double.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.325
- Woo.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.295
- I'm surprised you got anything
to bet at all after Abilene.

20:28.361 --> 20:31.230
That town is hard
on a cowboy's wallet.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.900
- We stay away from
that son of a bitch.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.469
It'll suck on you like a tick.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.805
- You better bat your eyes...

20:38.871 --> 20:44.076
- Even if we get a herd
to the wagons, we can't hold it.

20:44.143 --> 20:48.047
We can't leave till we've hired
some guns and some hands.

20:48.114 --> 20:51.318
- These Germans gotta learn
to hold their own, Thomas.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.121
Or they won't survive the trip.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.523
None of us will.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.893
- They're barely
surviving the river

21:00.960 --> 21:04.130
and they ain't camped
five miles from town.

21:04.196 --> 21:05.732
- There ain't no one to hire.

21:08.134 --> 21:10.169
- Then we don't go.

21:10.236 --> 21:12.772
- You can stay.
I'm going.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.776
I want to see it one last time.

21:18.811 --> 21:19.912
Before it's settled.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.116
Before it's ruined.

21:25.418 --> 21:29.055
- After you see it, then what?

21:30.189 --> 21:32.325
- Then I don't care.

21:32.392 --> 21:35.695
The world can
open up and eat me.

21:35.762 --> 21:36.963
I don't give a shit.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.932
[sniffs]

21:53.880 --> 21:55.915
- What's that for?

21:55.982 --> 21:57.283
- Well, it's for snakes.

21:57.350 --> 22:00.720
They won't cross it.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.789
- What about you?

22:02.855 --> 22:04.223
- Honey, I'm so far away
from a bath

22:04.290 --> 22:06.493
ain't no snake gonna
curl up next to me.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.798
Ah...

22:11.864 --> 22:13.633
[Elsa laughs]

22:17.837 --> 22:19.238
[clears throat]

22:19.972 --> 22:21.408
- Mm.

22:24.276 --> 22:25.445
[sighs]

22:26.446 --> 22:27.547
- Thank you.

22:28.815 --> 22:29.816
For bringing me.

22:30.717 --> 22:33.553
- Hm. Bringing you ain't a gift.

22:35.287 --> 22:36.856
We need you.

22:38.290 --> 22:39.325
So, thank you.

22:40.627 --> 22:43.129
These cattle are wild.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.998
These bulls will hook you.

22:46.065 --> 22:49.502
Don't get caught up
in the brush with one.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.471
You push the ones
that want to be pushed,

22:51.538 --> 22:53.372
the rest we leave behind.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.275
I need you to hear
me on that.

22:57.510 --> 22:58.511
- Yes.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.181
- I trust you.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.296
- Know what today is?

23:20.132 --> 23:21.701
- [laughs]
I don't know.

23:25.171 --> 23:26.506
Thursday, maybe?

23:31.210 --> 23:35.147
- Eighteen years-ago
on this day,

23:35.214 --> 23:39.719
Lee surrendered to Grant
in the home of Wilmer Mclean

23:39.786 --> 23:43.756
in the village of Appomattox.

23:43.823 --> 23:47.794
A year later, I was born.

23:47.860 --> 23:52.364
It was Monday,
April 9th, 1883,

23:54.467 --> 23:55.768
Monday was my birthday.

23:56.836 --> 23:59.839
- Yeah, Thursday.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.144
I think you're right.

24:19.025 --> 24:21.293
- Hey. Wake up.

24:23.696 --> 24:24.697
We gotta go.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.939
He's already saddled.

24:46.052 --> 24:47.353
I'll follow you.

24:47.419 --> 24:48.855
- I can't see.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.857
- Follow the horse
in front of you

24:50.923 --> 24:53.960
and watch its hooves
sparking off the rocks.

24:54.894 --> 24:58.364
[music]

25:25.024 --> 25:27.326
- We'll ride out
in a line from here.

25:27.393 --> 25:29.195
I'll drop you off as we go.

25:29.261 --> 25:31.063
When I'm set, I'll call out.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.232
The next man in line
does the same.

25:33.299 --> 25:34.934
Drive due west.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.837
When you hit the river don't
cross if you don't see tracks.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.472
It's boggy enough to swallow
horse and rider both.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.941
When you hit the meadow,

25:42.008 --> 25:44.510
wait for the men in
the south to fold north.

25:44.577 --> 25:47.346
Hold your line and we'll
push 'em right into camp.

25:48.715 --> 25:51.718
Stay here.
This is your hole.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.586
The rest follow me.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.929
- What do I do?
- You follow 'em.

26:05.131 --> 26:07.066
[music]

26:23.082 --> 26:24.917
- In the back, hold...

26:38.665 --> 26:40.900
[horse snorting]

26:43.435 --> 26:45.938
[music]

26:53.579 --> 26:55.414
[yipping]

27:07.694 --> 27:09.829
[shouting]

27:10.830 --> 27:12.098
[shouts]

27:15.134 --> 27:16.168
- Come on, buddy.

28:15.561 --> 28:16.863
[snorts]

28:19.899 --> 28:21.467
[kisses]

28:27.706 --> 28:28.640
- Hey.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.243
Ha. Ha!

28:32.278 --> 28:34.446
[music]

28:55.134 --> 28:56.302
[shouting]

28:59.438 --> 29:00.940
[cow lows]

29:04.743 --> 29:05.812
[whooping]

29:07.013 --> 29:09.315
- Push 'em up,
push 'em up!

29:09.381 --> 29:10.850
- Come on!

29:12.151 --> 29:13.352
Get!

29:13.419 --> 29:15.354
[whoops]
- Keep 'em comin'.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.790
- Whoa!
- Come on, cow!

29:17.857 --> 29:19.959
- Come on.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.729
[cow lows]

29:28.434 --> 29:30.236
- They're coming out of
the south with a few more.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.504
We'll marry them here,
then push em on.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.143
Makes you wonder what
the rich folk are doing, huh?

29:39.211 --> 29:41.680
- They ain't doing this.

29:41.747 --> 29:43.883
- No, ma'am, they ain't.
- [laughs]

29:51.323 --> 29:54.827
- I looked to my right
and saw my father,

29:54.894 --> 29:57.529
somehow riding vertically
toward the earth.

30:02.801 --> 30:06.538
Beyond him, cowboys
and cattle pushed toward us,

30:06.605 --> 30:09.608
dust following them
like a cloudy shadow.

30:10.877 --> 30:14.914
The light was soft
and pale and pink,

30:14.981 --> 30:19.751
like God decided to
light this day with candles.

30:19.818 --> 30:23.255
And the whole of Texas
spread out before me.

30:23.322 --> 30:27.426
It was the most magnificent
thing I'd ever seen.

30:27.493 --> 30:28.861
- Well, that went better
than I expected.

30:28.928 --> 30:30.229
- [chuckles]

30:31.931 --> 30:33.832
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

30:38.737 --> 30:40.639
- We got to get someone
at the mouth of that draw,

30:40.706 --> 30:42.674
so they don't leak into it.

30:42.741 --> 30:44.877
Someone else
to push from the rear.

30:44.944 --> 30:47.179
- I'll do it.

30:47.246 --> 30:48.580
Can I do it?

30:48.647 --> 30:50.649
- You can do it.
- [chuckles]

30:50.716 --> 30:51.984
[clicks tongue]

30:53.920 --> 30:59.625
[music]

30:59.691 --> 31:02.094
- All right, boys.
Let's get a moving.

31:02.161 --> 31:04.330
Yip!

31:04.396 --> 31:05.497
- Freedom...

31:06.966 --> 31:08.600
To most, it is an idea.

31:10.169 --> 31:12.538
An abstract thought that
pertains to control.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.175
That's not freedom.

31:16.242 --> 31:19.145
That's independence.

31:19.211 --> 31:24.250
Freedom is riding wild
over untamed land

31:24.316 --> 31:27.053
with no notion
any moment exists

31:27.119 --> 31:29.355
beyond the one you are living.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.832
[playing music]

31:53.412 --> 31:56.148
- They gonna play
music all night?

31:56.215 --> 31:58.117
- It looks that way.

31:58.184 --> 31:59.986
- When do they sleep?

32:00.052 --> 32:03.289
- That is a question
yet to be answered.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.624
But I know when you sleep:
you sleep now.

32:05.691 --> 32:10.096
- Yes, ma'am.
[woman singing]

32:10.162 --> 32:13.399
- Godless noise.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.501
We could be listening
to cicadas and frogs

32:15.567 --> 32:17.836
by the river, but instead
we're listening to this.

32:17.903 --> 32:19.371
- For once, we're in agreement.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.874
But I don't mind the song.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.210
I mean, it's sad...

32:26.078 --> 32:28.580
But I suppose I'd be sad too

32:28.647 --> 32:30.682
if I was a world away
from my home.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.818
- You are a world
away from your home.

32:37.756 --> 32:40.326
I don't know what he expects
to find in these mountains,

32:40.392 --> 32:41.960
or wherever it is
we're headed,

32:42.028 --> 32:43.529
but I'll tell you
what we won't find:

32:43.595 --> 32:45.864
we won't find civilization.

32:45.931 --> 32:48.367
We won't find
a church for prayer

32:48.434 --> 32:51.837
or a house with wood floors
or painted walls,

32:51.903 --> 32:57.676
restaurants or friends
or schools for our children.

32:57.743 --> 32:59.545
We just left it all behind.

33:01.447 --> 33:04.016
- I don't recall anyone forcing
you on the train, Claire.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.491
- Fate forced me.

33:13.859 --> 33:15.561
When it robbed me of a husband

33:15.627 --> 33:18.330
and robbed my child
of a future with him.

33:18.397 --> 33:21.833
What was I to do,
beg on the street?

33:21.900 --> 33:24.070
Don't recall anyone
forcing me...

33:27.873 --> 33:29.941
Who the hell do you
think you are?

33:31.843 --> 33:33.179
- I...

33:34.913 --> 33:36.348
- What is so funny?

33:36.415 --> 33:37.949
- Honestly, Claire...

33:38.016 --> 33:39.918
I don't have the energy
or the interest

33:39.985 --> 33:42.721
to continue this conversation.

33:42.788 --> 33:43.789
- Well.

33:44.823 --> 33:46.125
[scoffs]

33:48.127 --> 33:49.895
He's a dreamer, Margaret.

33:49.961 --> 33:52.164
Always has been.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.799
And they never come true.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.102
- It's coming true, Claire.

33:56.168 --> 33:57.269
- No.

33:58.537 --> 33:59.838
This is not the dream.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.376
This is the nightmare.

34:09.715 --> 34:10.716
You'll see.

34:12.184 --> 34:15.554
[music]

34:35.607 --> 34:37.876
- You drink coffee?

34:37.943 --> 34:39.411
- It's not for me.

34:39.478 --> 34:40.646
- No one else here.

34:45.817 --> 34:46.752
You lied!

34:46.818 --> 34:48.320
- I did, didn't I?

34:48.387 --> 34:49.955
- What kind of a woman
drinks coffee?

34:50.021 --> 34:53.292
- I can't wait to hear
this lecture on womanhood.

34:53.359 --> 34:54.926
This coffee is for him.

34:54.993 --> 34:56.295
After a long night.

34:56.362 --> 34:59.598
Someday, if you're lucky
to find a man

34:59.665 --> 35:03.202
or simply find a man
who is extremely unlucky,

35:03.269 --> 35:08.340
you will learn coffee is a
welcome treat after a hard ride.

35:13.312 --> 35:14.846
Mmm.

35:23.289 --> 35:25.191
[hooves approaching]

35:25.257 --> 35:27.526
- Take it easy,
just a little bit.

35:31.597 --> 35:33.532
- Where's the wagon boss?

35:33.599 --> 35:35.066
- He camps to the south.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.973
- [laughs]
Fucking gypsies.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.942
Gypsies don't travel
with much, I've learned.

35:44.009 --> 35:45.644
But you, uh...

35:45.711 --> 35:50.216
You Irish, y'all usually
travel well stocked.

35:50.282 --> 35:53.985
I'll ask again,
where's your wagon boss?

35:54.052 --> 35:56.888
- You'll be meeting
him soon enough.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.257
- Mm-hmm.

35:58.324 --> 36:01.159
- We have nothing
to offer you, sir. Be gone!

36:04.095 --> 36:05.797
- Be gone, she says.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.602
- What do you want here?

36:10.669 --> 36:13.572
- Last I checked,
ain't nobody owned the river.

36:15.106 --> 36:16.508
Be gone.

36:26.218 --> 36:27.786
Hell.

36:30.522 --> 36:31.823
[panting]

36:36.262 --> 36:37.996
- God dammit.

36:38.063 --> 36:41.900
- Go!
You're not welcome here! Go!

36:42.968 --> 36:44.035
Go!

36:46.438 --> 36:48.240
[gasps]

36:48.307 --> 36:51.610
- You are the devil! I see you!
I see you!

36:51.677 --> 36:52.978
I see you!

36:56.982 --> 36:58.350
[screaming]

37:01.553 --> 37:04.356
- And to think, all I wanted
to do was water the horses.

37:04.423 --> 37:07.192
Ain't all I want to do now.

37:07.259 --> 37:08.327
[shotgun cocks]

37:08.394 --> 37:10.662
- It'll be the
last thing you do.

37:11.997 --> 37:14.266
- There's a dozen guns
with sixty bullets

37:14.333 --> 37:15.701
between 'em out here.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.570
You've only got two.
- And they're both for you.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.475
[shouting]
[gunshot]

37:24.676 --> 37:26.912
- Aw! Get off me!

37:28.314 --> 37:30.215
[horse grunting]

37:31.317 --> 37:34.119
[grunts]

37:34.185 --> 37:35.220
[gunshots]

37:35.287 --> 37:37.423
[shouting]

37:43.629 --> 37:45.597
- John?

37:46.765 --> 37:48.834
John?

37:49.868 --> 37:51.036
[gunfire, screaming]

37:55.774 --> 37:57.242
[screaming]

38:01.613 --> 38:05.016
- No! No!
No, no!

38:06.017 --> 38:07.586
[screaming in German]

38:15.927 --> 38:20.966
John! John!

38:21.032 --> 38:24.002
- Mama?
- John!

38:24.069 --> 38:26.271
Oh my God, oh my God!

38:28.807 --> 38:31.209
[music]

38:31.276 --> 38:33.745
[sobs]

38:46.392 --> 38:48.360
[cries]

39:16.822 --> 39:20.559
- Hey. That's a girl.

39:20.626 --> 39:22.928
- Yep.
Dress sort of gave it away.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.563
- Pretty handy.

39:24.630 --> 39:27.399
- She got around good.

39:27.466 --> 39:29.468
- Not awful to look at either.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.504
- Hard to tell with
that hat hanging over her head

39:32.571 --> 39:34.072
like elephant ears.

39:35.574 --> 39:38.977
- Hey.
[clicks tongue]

39:39.044 --> 39:40.579
[whistling]
- Come on.

39:40.646 --> 39:42.681
- Hey.

39:42.748 --> 39:43.915
Thirsty?

39:48.587 --> 39:50.789
There you go.
Careful.

39:50.856 --> 39:52.390
Would you take off your hat?

39:53.391 --> 39:54.893
Wanna get a better look at you.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.362
- Why get a better look?

39:57.429 --> 39:59.297
- Well.

39:59.364 --> 40:01.366
There's a fair chance
you're too pretty for me.

40:01.433 --> 40:04.369
If you are, I'd rather know
now so I don't waste my time.

40:05.771 --> 40:07.405
- Maybe you're
too pretty for me.

40:07.473 --> 40:09.775
[laughs]

40:09.841 --> 40:11.810
- Well, shoot.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.679
I mean, if me being pretty
is the problem,

40:13.745 --> 40:16.147
then we ain't got a problem.

40:17.616 --> 40:19.184
Shoot.

40:32.030 --> 40:34.399
Yep.

40:34.466 --> 40:35.701
Too pretty for me.

40:37.135 --> 40:38.069
Dang it.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.105
[laughing]

40:50.916 --> 40:55.086
- And just like that,
horror steps from the shadows.

40:56.221 --> 40:57.989
And our freedom was gone...

40:58.056 --> 40:59.825
[music]

41:20.712 --> 41:23.148
- We're gonna ride
into town with Josef

41:23.214 --> 41:24.950
and meet the Marshal.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.518
I'd like you with us.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.922
- Somebody needs to be here
in case they come back.

41:31.990 --> 41:34.225
- Cowboys are here.

41:34.292 --> 41:36.227
They've done dealt with
their share of bandits.

41:36.294 --> 41:38.229
[music]

41:52.077 --> 41:53.211
- I'm so sorry.

41:55.213 --> 41:57.783
- What are you sorry about?

41:57.849 --> 41:59.551
You didn't shoot her.

42:01.152 --> 42:02.420
- I'm still sorry.

42:04.189 --> 42:07.492
- Are you?
[scoffs]

42:10.996 --> 42:12.097
- Yes.

42:12.163 --> 42:14.165
- You don't know
what that word means.

42:17.068 --> 42:19.971
But you're going to learn.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.773
All of you are going to learn.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.122
- Going after them?

42:37.188 --> 42:38.189
- Yeah.

42:39.791 --> 42:43.094
- They were rough
and they were rude,

42:43.161 --> 42:45.230
and they were looking for it...

42:47.465 --> 42:49.000
But I can't say
they started it.

42:51.436 --> 42:53.071
- It don't matter
who started it.

42:54.706 --> 42:56.642
- I'm just saying...

42:56.708 --> 42:58.376
Not sure there's justice in it.

43:01.312 --> 43:03.314
- I believe in you,
and I believe in that boy,

43:03.381 --> 43:05.516
and I believe in our daughter.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.584
And that's all.

43:09.621 --> 43:11.222
Justice don't factor into it.

43:16.662 --> 43:19.564
You know that gun
that's in your saddle bag?

43:19.631 --> 43:20.632
- Yes, sir?

43:22.668 --> 43:24.102
- You sleep with it.

43:24.169 --> 43:25.603
[music]

43:32.377 --> 43:34.379
[cocks rifle]

43:42.788 --> 43:45.023
Sheriff: You think they
came to town?

43:45.090 --> 43:47.458
Shea: Where else would they go?

43:47.525 --> 43:49.761
- Well, if they're here they'll
be at the White Elephant.

43:53.965 --> 43:55.967
You're the only one
without a badge.

43:56.034 --> 43:57.769
- Will a badge
make me shoot better?

43:57.836 --> 43:59.337
- Doubtful.

43:59.404 --> 44:03.208
But it'll keep a rope off your
neck if things go sideways.

44:03.274 --> 44:04.642
Raise your right hand.

44:15.286 --> 44:18.089
- Ain't I gotta swear
to something?

44:18.156 --> 44:19.691
- You just did.

44:24.629 --> 44:26.998
- What about me?

44:28.033 --> 44:29.134
- What did you say?

44:31.069 --> 44:33.671
- Me. What about me?

44:33.739 --> 44:36.775
- You just keep your trap shut
'til I tell you to open it.

44:43.048 --> 44:45.917
[music]

45:10.275 --> 45:12.978
[piano playing]
Come on, keep up.

45:13.044 --> 45:14.045
Come here.

45:15.747 --> 45:17.548
[indistinct chatter]

45:30.195 --> 45:32.730
You see any of 'em,
you point 'em out, all right?

45:42.573 --> 45:43.842
All right, any more?

45:48.880 --> 45:50.681
That back table.

45:54.552 --> 45:55.821
Yeah, I know this crew.

46:03.728 --> 46:05.130
Clyde Barker!

46:10.635 --> 46:13.638
What of this business
on the Trinity?

46:13.704 --> 46:16.975
- We were just watering horses
and these immigrants--

46:17.042 --> 46:18.043
[scream]

46:33.925 --> 46:35.093
- Is there any more?

46:39.030 --> 46:41.132
Don't just sit there
shaking, are there any more?

46:53.311 --> 46:54.712
- I ain't armed.

46:54.779 --> 46:56.181
Them immigrants took my guns.

46:56.247 --> 46:57.482
- I can see that.

47:13.431 --> 47:14.866
If you want to
dance with the girls?

47:14.933 --> 47:15.967
Dance with the girls.

47:17.368 --> 47:19.204
If you want to drink at the bar?
Drink at the bar.

47:23.441 --> 47:26.144
But if anybody here
fancy himself a gunman...

47:28.646 --> 47:30.115
You're in the wrong town.

47:32.750 --> 47:35.253
There's only one killer
in Fort Worth and that's me.

47:47.232 --> 47:49.500
[indistinct chatter]

47:52.137 --> 47:54.472
- We're gonna head north
first thing in the morning.

47:54.539 --> 47:56.107
- They ain't ready.

47:56.174 --> 47:57.675
- They'd better get ready.

47:57.742 --> 48:00.011
Because everybody in this town
is gonna be looking for us,

48:00.078 --> 48:01.479
and if they find us
they're gonna hang us

48:01.546 --> 48:02.813
from a fucking tree.

48:07.085 --> 48:08.519
- God damnit.

48:08.586 --> 48:10.621
[music]

48:25.636 --> 48:27.472
- Did you find them?

48:27.538 --> 48:28.773
- We found them.

48:31.076 --> 48:32.277
- And?

48:42.053 --> 48:43.288
- We murdered them.

49:04.142 --> 49:05.610
[sighs]

49:26.998 --> 49:29.800
- Keep 20 feet between you.

49:29.867 --> 49:31.702
At water you wait to cross

49:31.769 --> 49:34.405
until the wagon
in front of you has crossed.

49:34.472 --> 49:37.975
Do not let your children
ride on the buckboard,

49:38.043 --> 49:40.245
they will fall off.

49:41.979 --> 49:44.215
Hold your children
and mind your animals.

49:52.090 --> 49:54.392
- I figure we'll
see you up to the Red.

49:54.459 --> 49:57.295
Ain't got nuthin better to do.

49:57.362 --> 49:59.897
Besides, there's a
few widows among them now.

50:01.099 --> 50:02.833
- You change your minds as well?

50:02.900 --> 50:06.637
- Well, it's the chivalrous
thing to do.

50:06.704 --> 50:08.706
- Earn your keep.

50:08.773 --> 50:10.975
This ain't no travelling
fucking carnival.

50:12.943 --> 50:14.645
- We know what this
is better than you do.

50:16.347 --> 50:18.849
- We know what we're
getting into, Captain.

50:18.916 --> 50:20.351
And we earn our keep.

50:23.521 --> 50:26.291
[music]

50:36.301 --> 50:37.635
- It's time.

50:39.737 --> 50:40.871
- No.

50:45.243 --> 50:46.644
Don't touch me.

50:52.683 --> 50:54.685
- Go help them hold the cattle.

50:58.589 --> 50:59.857
Let me talk with her.

51:05.830 --> 51:07.632
You don't want to go?

51:07.698 --> 51:09.800
- Where are you going, James?

51:09.867 --> 51:14.105
What do you think is waiting
for you out there?

51:14.172 --> 51:15.173
Eden?

51:16.874 --> 51:19.009
Eden is a garden.

51:22.280 --> 51:24.048
There are no gardens here.

51:25.350 --> 51:27.685
- You plant gardens.
You build them.

51:29.554 --> 51:31.889
- No, gardeners plant
gardens, James.

51:31.956 --> 51:33.491
We are not gardeners.

51:36.694 --> 51:38.163
- You'll die here.

51:39.697 --> 51:41.832
- You say that
like it's a warning.

51:48.273 --> 51:50.708
What do I have left
to live for, James?

51:55.646 --> 51:58.183
I have had seven children...

51:58.249 --> 52:04.121
[music]

52:04.189 --> 52:08.159
and they have all ended up
just like this one.

52:08.226 --> 52:10.428
In the dirt I kneel beside.

52:13.264 --> 52:15.400
I am done kneeling.

52:17.902 --> 52:19.870
I am ready to lay down.

52:22.507 --> 52:25.576
- Well, I can't just
leave you here.

52:25.643 --> 52:27.845
- Well, it's a free
country, remember?

52:29.780 --> 52:32.950
It is not your decision to make.
It is mine. And I have made it.

52:40.558 --> 52:41.659
- Goodbye, Claire.

52:43.194 --> 52:45.162
- God damn you, James.

52:45.230 --> 52:47.965
God damn you and your dreams.

52:48.032 --> 52:50.668
[music]

52:57.608 --> 52:59.544
[sobbing]

53:24.902 --> 53:26.504
- Move 'em, Thomas!

53:29.139 --> 53:34.279
[music]

53:34.345 --> 53:36.180
- Let's go.

54:01.972 --> 54:03.308
- You let her stay?

54:03.374 --> 54:05.876
- I didn't let her do anything.
That choice ain't mine.

54:06.911 --> 54:08.279
Don't look back.

54:10.815 --> 54:12.149
- What are you gonna do?

54:15.953 --> 54:17.422
- I'll catch up.

54:24.295 --> 54:25.696
- Stay in the wagon, son.

54:29.600 --> 54:33.037
[music]

54:47.184 --> 54:49.587
- Figure I'd stick around.

54:49.654 --> 54:51.989
Make sure you don't
drown in a river.

54:52.056 --> 54:55.793
- Thought I was too pretty
for you.

54:55.860 --> 55:00.164
- You are, but I'm pretty
short on common sense, so...

55:02.132 --> 55:04.702
- I've painted a picture
of my husband in my mind...

55:06.971 --> 55:08.806
And he don't look like you.

55:08.873 --> 55:13.010
- Well, I'm a cowboy, ma'am.

55:13.077 --> 55:14.612
We don't look
like nobody's husband.

55:16.381 --> 55:17.548
But we're the ones
you think about

55:17.615 --> 55:18.949
when your husband ain't around.

55:20.751 --> 55:22.152
[laughing]

55:25.022 --> 55:26.190
- Come on.

55:52.850 --> 55:54.485
[chuckles]

56:04.228 --> 56:05.696
[sobs]

56:46.170 --> 56:48.606
[crying]

57:01.952 --> 57:04.121
- No way to stop her?

57:04.188 --> 57:05.756
- For what?

57:12.997 --> 57:14.965
I've dug my share alone.

57:15.032 --> 57:17.635
- So have I, and wouldn't
wish it on anybody.

57:21.872 --> 57:23.474
I admire her courage.

57:24.642 --> 57:27.411
- It wasn't courage.
- Yes, it was.

57:27.478 --> 57:30.314
[music]

57:57.374 --> 58:00.745
Elsa: What began as a journey
had become a retreat.

58:00.811 --> 58:03.113
Into the unknown.

58:06.917 --> 58:09.720
We were backing into the abyss,

58:09.787 --> 58:12.222
so worried our
sins would follow us,

58:12.289 --> 58:14.792
we didn't bother
watching where we walked.

58:18.663 --> 58:21.165
And behind us was a cliff.

58:45.756 --> 58:49.694
[music]
