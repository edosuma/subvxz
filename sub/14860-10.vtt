00:04.213 --> 00:07.001
Six front row tickets to the
Rock Bottom Remainders concert.

00:07.299 --> 00:09.290
Ha ha! What is that?

00:09.593 --> 00:13.211
Only the most popular
rock band in the world,

00:13.514 --> 00:16.381

Well, in less
confusing news,

00:38.914 --> 00:41.201
Dave and I wanna have everyone
over for Thanksgiving this year.

00:41.500 --> 00:41.910

already started prepping, Jane.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.163
I've already started
prepping Thanksgiving

00:55.222 --> 00:56.553
Perfect.
Then it's settled.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.805
(SIGHS) Although
this time of year

00:59.101 --> 01:00.842
is always a little
bittersweet for me.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.680
(GROANS)
There it is.

01:02.980 --> 01:06.018
Thanksgiving is a real reminder
of my people's hardships.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.353
As an American living with
one-sixteenth Navajo-ism,

01:08.652 --> 01:10.768
I'm gonna use this
as an opportunity

01:11.071 --> 01:12.857
to educate... Perhaps
enlighten all you white people,

01:13.156 --> 01:14.738
and throw
an authentic Thanksgiving.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.194
White people?
(SIGHS)

01:16.493 --> 01:17.324
You guys
wouldn't understand.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.485
None of your ancestors were
at the first Thanksgiving.

01:19.788 --> 01:20.949
Okay, neither were
the Navajo.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.738
One of our many snubs.
Yeah.

01:23.041 --> 01:26.124
Oh! Fun factoid. at the time
of the first Thanksgiving,

01:26.420 --> 01:29.128
our Serbian ancestors were
having a Thanksgiving of their own.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.164
They were thanking God for
sparing them from the wolves

01:31.466 --> 01:32.797
while giving each other
the plague.

01:33.635 --> 01:34.295
(SIGHS)

01:35.887 --> 01:37.298
That fact
wasn't fun, was it?

01:37.598 --> 01:39.259
Oh, you'll get 'em
next time, kiddo.

01:39.558 --> 01:40.013

01:51.486 --> 01:53.147
DAVE:
I'm so excited about this.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.280
For our first dinner party at our
new place, | feel so sophisticated.

01:56.575 --> 01:57.656
Plus, look,
| can make the turkey dance.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.197
Where are those clams
that I put on the shopping list?

02:04.499 --> 02:06.536
Oh, I thought
that was a mistake.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.451
Why would you want clams
on Thanksgiving?

02:08.753 --> 02:10.791
| just assumed
you meant clamps.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.796
Why would I want clamps
on Thanksgiving?

02:13.091 --> 02:14.798
| don't know!
For clampin' stuff!

02:15.844 --> 02:16.675
See? Look.
(CLANKING)

02:17.971 --> 02:19.211
Don't need to worry
about that.

02:19.514 --> 02:20.970
It's all clamped up.

02:21.266 --> 02:25.260
Al, quahog clams were a featured
dish in the first Thanksgiving.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.519
| guess I gotta go get some
now to prove to you guys

02:27.814 --> 02:29.646
how much better
an authentic Thanksgiving is.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.774
Oh, Dave, come on. I respect
your cultural traditions.

02:33.070 --> 02:37.564
That's why... I made...
Navajo-Ho-Hos.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.779
Tepees, Al? The Navajo
did not live in tepee.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.318

On Real World: Sacramento.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.155
Uh-huh.
Of course.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.616
Totally normal. And how
they couldn't air that season

03:26.915 --> 03:27.950
because one of the roommates
burned down

03:28.250 --> 03:28.990
the converted firehouse
we were living in?

03:29.292 --> 03:29.906
Uh-huh.
Of course.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.496
To the ground.

03:31.795 --> 03:32.876
Well, they finally
sent me the DVDs,

03:33.171 --> 03:34.707

including the episode

03:35.006 --> 03:35.461

to visit.

Oh, my God!
Aah!

03:38.427 --> 03:40.543
(PENNY LAUGHING) Oh,
man! That was so long ago.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.177
That was before Dave and |
started dating.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.678
(GASPS)
That's where you met Brad.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.760

berries for the first time.

This is me coming out.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.640
If that season had aired,

we watch this that I am a hero.

how our six-some

04:08.749 --> 04:09.910

on The Real World,

04:10.208 --> 04:11.039

about a mile away.

a few dollars for gas?

08:25.839 --> 08:28.080
MAX: Talk about hair.
Look at Jane Stefani and Dave.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.215

an extra in Singles.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.753
What the fish?
Free haircuts?

08:34.054 --> 08:37.764

usually outside. It's so clever.

08:38.058 --> 08:40.926
Oh, Boo, this is when

Oh, look what time it is.

But the tub can clearly only
seat six people safely,

08:52.824 --> 08:54.235
maybe seven if we do
that weird thing

08:54.534 --> 08:55.319
where someone sits
in the middle.

08:55.618 --> 08:59.077
So I will make
a sign-up sheet, right?

08:59.372 --> 09:00.954
And we can all
take turns.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.705
Whoo! Sacramento!

09:03.418 --> 09:04.954
Sign-up sheet!

09:05.253 --> 09:06.743
Dude, what is
that girl's deal, man?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.754
She's so controlling.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.414
She should make a sign-up
sheet for who should stop talking

09:10.717 --> 09:12.173
and put herself
on top of the list.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.800

09:14.095 --> 09:16.757
Ugh! These shows!

your wife so much.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.066
(LAUGHS) Ah!

09:30.361 --> 09:32.352
It's crazy, like, how
they edit that stuff, right?

09:32.655 --> 09:34.237
It's like, how did they
make me say that?

09:34.532 --> 09:35.943
| didn't even say that.
It's like, what did they do?

09:36.242 --> 09:37.232

up in my mouth and just, like...

(GASPS)
Kerko-bitch, huh?

09:48.671 --> 09:51.629
Jane, that can't be the first

09:51.925 --> 09:53.415
It is the first time
you've heard that.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.083
So don't mention anything
about the fact

09:55.386 --> 09:56.126

| came up with "Jerk-ovich."

Will someone please get me
out of this cadence, 'cause...

10:01.142 --> 10:02.473
| am not controlling!

10:02.769 --> 10:05.101
I'll prove it.
You know what, Alex?

10:05.396 --> 10:06.807
Let's make potatoes
together.

10:07.107 --> 10:07.847
We can make them
any way you want...

10:08.149 --> 10:10.811
Either the good way
or your way.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.601
We can make my famous
bad potatoes this year?

10:12.904 --> 10:14.986
Jane, come on.
That was years ago.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.442

on my face.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.575
Yeah, why don't we all
take a fiver,

Here's the dealio.

Some pilgrims stole my car and
phone, so I can't call my friends

any of their numbers.

they won't take you to get clams

a taxi service for idiots."

that you and I could have

10:47.313 --> 10:51.728

of weird.

with Max, too, remember?

16:46.881 --> 16:48.087
right now ten years ago.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.373
Guys, listen,
Penny thinks it's weird

16:50.676 --> 16:51.757
that Dave hasn't
moved his stuff in.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.168
Is that really so weird?

16:53.471 --> 16:54.006
ALL: Yes!

16:54.931 --> 16:55.636
Oh.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.221
[, uh, didn't realize
you all felt that way.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.803
Guess it is
a little weird.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.143
Well, let's just see
what Dave has to say about it.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.182
Dave?

17:07.818 --> 17:08.728
David.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.439
Dave?

17:10.738 --> 17:11.978
Has Dave not been here
this whole time?

17:12.281 --> 17:13.146
| could have sworn he just
handed me this beer.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.148
Aah! Clams!

17:16.452 --> 17:17.031
Dave, are you okay, man?
(SNEEZES)

17:17.328 --> 17:19.410
Ay! Gosh.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.116
Dude, did you just give me
this beer, like, five minutes ago?

17:21.415 --> 17:24.031
Dude, you just sneezed
right in my mouth.

17:24.335 --> 17:25.040
(NASAL VOICE) | need
some hand sani for my face.

17:25.336 --> 17:27.042
(COUGHS)

17:27.338 --> 17:28.169
And then they got
my car back.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.954
ALL: Great.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.044
But then they confiscated
my R.B.R. tickets.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.715
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah!

17:36.013 --> 17:37.048
That's terrible.
Tough week.

17:37.348 --> 17:39.180
But it wasn't all bad.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.433
| mean, I wanted an authentic
Thanksgiving, and I got so much more.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.015
| experienced the entire plight
of the Native American people

17:45.314 --> 17:46.349
in just one day.

17:46.649 --> 17:47.730
Oh, no, you didn't.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.607
That is wildly insensitive.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.985
And 'cause of my hardships,
| feel as though

17:53.281 --> 17:54.942
I've earned the right
to bestow upon myself

17:55.241 --> 17:57.152
my own Indian name.
Oh.

17:57.451 --> 18:01.115
So henceforth, I will be known
as "Has Ordeals With Clams."

18:01.414 --> 18:02.620
| don't like it.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.826
Now is that
a legal name change,

18:05.126 --> 18:06.412
or this like the time you
wanted us to call you "Lindsey"?

18:06.711 --> 18:08.167
It's so much bigger
than that.

18:08.462 --> 18:09.748
Oh, excuse me, Linds.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.629
(SIGHS DEEPLY)
Pen.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.419
| overreacted. I know
you were just asking me

18:17.722 --> 18:19.838
a normal question about
Dave moving in, and I'm sorry.

18:20.141 --> 18:22.428
Look, I would never try
to hurt your relationship,

18:22.727 --> 18:24.843
and our friendship is the
most important thing to me.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.353
Yeah. And I am so
happy that you're happy.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.685
And me and Dave?
(SCOFFS)

18:29.984 --> 18:32.100
That would be...
(SINGSONGY) Crah-zah!

18:32.403 --> 18:33.643
(NORMAL VOICE) Crazy. |
should have just said "crazy."

18:33.946 --> 18:35.277
I'm the one who's
acting crazy.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.780
It's... It's just that...

18:38.075 --> 18:39.941
| hadn't eaten in, like, 20 minutes.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.905
There we go.
| think that was it.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.070
Your blood sugar...
You've gotta stay on top of it.

18:44.373 --> 18:48.116
So... Pretty crazy
Dave story, huh?

18:48.419 --> 18:50.501
Probably the most surprising
event or piece of information

18:50.796 --> 18:52.161
that's come to light today.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.170
| just can't believe
| was only an accident.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.632
Well, you know, ... I
was doing some research,

18:56.927 --> 18:58.884
and you know what else
was an accident,

18:59.180 --> 19:01.012
but then turned out
to be amazing?

19:01.307 --> 19:02.889
The slinky.
Nuh-unh.

19:03.184 --> 19:05.175
And corn flakes.
(GASPS)

19:05.478 --> 19:06.684
And Play-Doh. (WHISPERS)
| love the way that smells

19:06.979 --> 19:07.969
but not the way it tastes.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.728
And penicillin.

19:10.024 --> 19:10.764
(NASAL VOICE) | needed
so much of that in college.

19:12.193 --> 19:13.809
Oh! I love
all that stuff!

19:14.111 --> 19:16.148
And the accident
of us kissing

19:16.447 --> 19:17.778
didn't turn out to just
be something great,

19:18.074 --> 19:19.690
but it...it was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.487
(GROANS)

19:22.787 --> 19:25.324
And every moment after that
was no accident.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.120
(CLICKS TEETH)
Aw. Babe.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.253
BOTH: Mmm.

19:34.548 --> 19:35.834
Dave, I gotta ask you
a question,

19:36.133 --> 19:38.295
and I want you to be
totally honest with me.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.755
Why haven't you moved
your stuff in yet?

19:40.054 --> 19:41.715
What? I told you.
I'm moving in this weekend.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.927
That's the earliest
| could get movers.

19:45.226 --> 19:46.512
Don't tell me you were
eyes-open napping again.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.682
Hey, movers are coming with
my stuff on Saturday, okay?

19:52.400 --> 19:53.435
(SNORING)

19:54.860 --> 19:56.021
| do do that.
It's weird, huh?

19:56.570 --> 19:57.401
Yeah.

20:00.783 --> 20:03.320
Well, I've prepared the clams
in the traditional manner,

20:03.619 --> 20:05.826
then I sampled them and
subsequently disposed of them.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.533
You're welcome.

20:07.832 --> 20:10.290
But this turkey...
Oh, my God. It is delish.

20:10.584 --> 20:11.995
| guess I really
outdid myself.

20:12.294 --> 20:15.878
Yeah, you did, Al.
To the Kerko-bitch sisters.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.208
Yeah!
Yeah!

20:17.508 --> 20:18.714
Happy Thanksgiving!
Happy Thanksgiving.

20:19.009 --> 20:21.091
(COCKNEY ACCENT)
Happy Thanksgiving.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.969
ALEX: (COCKNEY ACCENT)
Happy Thanksgiving.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.629
(ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY
IN COCKNEY ACCENTS)

20:28.310 --> 20:30.051
Where are my porridge
and my turkey leg?

20:34.442 --> 20:35.432
Dude, I don't know
what to tell you.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.726
That's not my dish.
That is your dish.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.360
No, it's not! Yes, it...
I'm not washing that dish.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.772
| don't care what you do,
Wyclefl

20:43.075 --> 20:45.157
Dude, don't...don't...
don't start with me, dude.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.660
What? What do you mean? I... I just
found out your name wasn't "Maps."

20:47.955 --> 20:49.445
| thought it was "Maps"
this whole time. Wh-wh...

20:49.749 --> 20:52.241
<i>Why would it be "Maps"? Who
names themself after a thing?</i>

20:52.543 --> 20:53.749
You don't wanna
make me angry, dude,

20:54.044 --> 20:55.079
'cause when I get angry,
| get naked,

20:55.379 --> 20:56.210
and when I get naked,
| fight. Bottom line.

20:57.798 --> 20:58.879
Now I...
Do you wanna go?

20:59.175 --> 21:00.040
No, I don't wanna
fight you naked.

21:01.719 --> 21:02.584
You're making it
real weird right now.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.002
I'm making it real weird?

21:04.305 --> 21:05.841
All right, Busta Bust.
Don't call me that.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.006
Why don't you throw your hands
where my eyes can see,

21:08.309 --> 21:10.971
which would be in the sink,
doing my dishes?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.307
You think I'm supposed to do your
dishes 'cause I'm black and I have dreads?

21:13.606 --> 21:15.688
No, you're supposed to do
my dishes because you're black,

21:15.983 --> 21:17.599
have dreads, and clearly... Ha!
You just said they were your dishes!

21:17.902 --> 21:19.484
You said they were
your dishes.

21:19.779 --> 21:20.814
You said they were
your dishes. You got me.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.228
(LAUGHS) They're your dishes.
You got me.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.397
They are my dishes. They are
my dishes. (BOTH LAUGHING)

21:24.700 --> 21:27.192
Bro, I got you.
| knew it!

21:27.495 --> 21:28.610
It's all right, dude. You
don't have to clean it up.

21:28.913 --> 21:29.527
Make someone else clean it
up. Yeah. Screw them, man.

21:29.830 --> 21:30.319
(LAUGHS)

21:38.255 --> 21:38.335
<i>I
I</i>
