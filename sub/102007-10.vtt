Uh, pressure's dropping, Cap.

10:18.860 --> 10:21.845

We have to try another way.

10:21.863 --> 10:23.363

I got kicked out of my office.

-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-You looking at me?

20:47.488 --> 20:52.065
Because everything
could be taken away from you

20:52.085 --> 20:53.642
-like that.
-Mm-hmm.

20:53.661 --> 20:56.587
I know. My house blew up.

20:56.739 --> 20:59.815
Yes. Exactly.

20:59.834 --> 21:01.166
Same.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.819
I mean, but in a different way.

21:03.838 --> 21:05.429
Good.

21:05.581 --> 21:07.748
'Cause then we'd both be looking
for a place to crash.

21:07.767 --> 21:08.933
(laughs)

21:09.084 --> 21:12.937
And things were going so great.

21:13.088 --> 21:17.775
After that crappy year
we all had,

21:17.926 --> 21:20.111
things were really looking up.

21:20.262 --> 21:22.838
And then...
(imitates explosion)

21:22.931 --> 21:24.365
(imitates explosion)

21:25.451 --> 21:29.495
Well, at least
you got your health.

21:31.849 --> 21:34.125
-Do I?
-Mm-hmm.

21:35.019 --> 21:36.869
Can I tell you a secret?

21:37.021 --> 21:39.463
(laughs):
I don't think so.

21:39.615 --> 21:42.374
So...

21:42.527 --> 21:46.470
I was supposed to get
this last cancer surgery,

21:46.697 --> 21:49.956
and I canceled it.

21:50.051 --> 21:51.050
You canceled it?

21:51.144 --> 21:53.436
(laughing):
Why?

21:54.539 --> 21:57.598
Just didn't seem like
the right time.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.891
So I pushed it.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.910
TK thinks I rescheduled it,

22:01.912 --> 22:03.696
but I didn't, so...

22:04.899 --> 22:07.241
Shh.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.977
Cap canceled his cancer surgery?

22:10.997 --> 22:12.979
Wait, probie, are you sure
you weren't just

22:12.999 --> 22:14.481
drunk-dreaming or something?

22:14.500 --> 22:16.000
Because I cannot get
my head around

22:16.227 --> 22:17.409
Cap doing something
so flat-out dumb.

22:17.562 --> 22:19.395
No, I'm telling you,
it was real, okay?

22:19.413 --> 22:20.504
The man's depressed.

22:20.731 --> 22:22.656
And given the shape that
he was in last night,

22:22.675 --> 22:25.067
-I'd be surprised if he
showed up to work today.
-OWEN: Hey.

22:25.086 --> 22:28.237
Paul, Marjan. Roomie.
(chuckles)

22:28.330 --> 22:30.573
-What are you guys
talking about?
-(all stammer)

22:30.666 --> 22:33.092
Just about the, uh, situation
at my house.

22:33.244 --> 22:34.426
Craziest story, right?

22:34.579 --> 22:37.763
Yeah, to-totally crazy, Cap.
Just...

22:37.915 --> 22:39.440
MARJAN:
Crazy.

22:40.267 --> 22:41.767
What happened at your house?

22:41.861 --> 22:44.195
Oh, it blew up.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.763
Hey, look who's back on duty.

22:54.782 --> 22:55.873
Hey, T.

22:56.024 --> 22:57.433
We missed you around here,
Juddy.

22:57.451 --> 23:00.285
Well, I missed being here.
And, uh, thank you for

23:00.438 --> 23:02.380
all the meal deliveries
these past few weeks.

23:02.607 --> 23:04.440
That was all Charles
and the girls.

23:04.458 --> 23:06.625
But I can tell you that
a lot of love went into them.

23:06.777 --> 23:08.034
Yeah, we could taste it.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.129
First day back.
How you feeling?

23:10.281 --> 23:13.224
I feel good, you know.
I'm-I'm, uh, rip-rarin' to go.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.618
Oh. Yeah, you're worried sick
about your wife, aren't you?

23:15.636 --> 23:17.302
-You don't know the half of it.
-(chuckles)

23:17.397 --> 23:19.638
I mean, Grace has never asked
for help her whole life,

23:19.732 --> 23:22.716
and she made it very clear
that she ain't gonna start now.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.218
All right, well, you're
checking up on her, right?

23:25.312 --> 23:28.072
-Every other minute.
-And she always responds?

23:28.299 --> 23:29.890
With the patience of a saint.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.391
Then do not worry.

23:31.411 --> 23:34.060
Unless you have something
to worry about.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.913
Besides, if she's anything
like I was

23:36.140 --> 23:38.249
early in my pregnancy,
she won't stray

23:38.400 --> 23:41.493
more than ten feet from
that couch unless she has to.

23:41.646 --> 23:42.903
(both chuckle)

23:42.922 --> 23:45.131
Yeah.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.677
(panting)

24:05.928 --> 24:08.003
Ma'am?

24:08.096 --> 24:09.763
Would you like a hand?

24:09.782 --> 24:11.264
You're very kind.
I'm just--

24:11.284 --> 24:13.175
I'm just picking up
a few things.

24:13.268 --> 24:16.178
Are you sure?
I'm happy to help.

24:16.197 --> 24:18.514
I'm sure.
Thank you, sir.

24:18.607 --> 24:21.709
-Well, you have a good day.
-You, too.

24:24.689 --> 24:25.754
(exhales sharply)

24:39.962 --> 24:42.271
(groans, pants)

24:46.727 --> 24:49.803
(grunts, gasps)

24:49.822 --> 24:51.280
(sighs)

24:57.497 --> 24:59.330
(groans)

25:02.651 --> 25:05.336
-(crunching)
-(gasping)

25:05.487 --> 25:06.486
Oh, no.

25:06.506 --> 25:09.215
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

25:15.831 --> 25:18.724
(phone vibrating)

25:21.003 --> 25:23.003
(pained groan)

25:23.022 --> 25:25.231
(panting)

25:36.184 --> 25:39.870
Grace... you got this.

25:40.097 --> 25:42.114
You are gonna get your butt up,

25:42.266 --> 25:44.542
and you are gonna drive home.

25:46.528 --> 25:48.695
Okay.

25:48.789 --> 25:52.941
Oh... one, two, three.

25:53.002 --> 25:55.201
(cries out)

25:55.221 --> 25:59.473
Okay, no, no.
Okay, no, no.

26:00.301 --> 26:04.044
Honey... are you all right?

26:04.063 --> 26:06.230
Yes, ma'am, I'm just...

26:06.457 --> 26:08.624
I'm enjoying the fresh air,
that's all.

26:08.642 --> 26:10.359
Are you sure?

26:11.478 --> 26:14.146
Yeah, I'm totally fine.
Thank you.

26:14.298 --> 26:15.739
Oh, okay, then.
Well, you take care.

26:15.966 --> 26:17.241
You, too.

26:17.468 --> 26:20.452
And I think
your ice cream is melting.

26:33.926 --> 26:37.261
(siren wailing)

26:37.412 --> 26:39.171
OWEN:
How the hell did he
get up there?

26:39.265 --> 26:41.247
Dormers are sealed.
Our best guess is the boy

26:41.267 --> 26:44.101
-squeezed out an attic vent.
-Brave kid.

26:44.328 --> 26:48.606
Just stay where you are, baby.
They're gonna help get you down.

26:48.757 --> 26:52.017
Tell them to go away.
I don't want to come down.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.111
Captain Strand, this is Whitney.

26:54.262 --> 26:55.779
Her son Shawn is on the roof.

26:55.931 --> 26:57.448
Hey, hi. How you doing? Hey,
has he ever done this before?

26:57.599 --> 26:59.116
No, but he's never been
this upset before.

26:59.343 --> 27:00.284
Today's his birthday.

27:00.511 --> 27:01.785
I invited
the whole neighborhood,

27:01.937 --> 27:03.028
but no one showed up.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.847
We're new in town.

27:04.865 --> 27:06.123
He took it really hard.

27:06.274 --> 27:07.866
All right, well,
we're gonna get him down.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.627
My team here is the best
in the business.

27:09.854 --> 27:11.703
Thank you.

27:11.856 --> 27:13.038
<i> PAUL (over comm):</i>
<i> I don't know, probie.</i>
<i> I've been watching him</i>

27:13.132 --> 27:14.356
like a hawk all day.

27:14.375 --> 27:15.691
If the man's depressed,
he sure has

27:15.784 --> 27:16.875
<i> an amazing poker face.</i>

27:17.027 --> 27:18.377
He does have an amazing
poker face.

27:18.529 --> 27:20.362
<i> JUDD (over comm):</i>
<i> Wait, who y'all talking about?</i>

27:20.381 --> 27:22.214
-Who's depressed now?
<i> -MARJAN: Cap. Mateo got wasted</i>

27:22.366 --> 27:24.791
with him last night, and
apparently, he spilled his guts

27:24.885 --> 27:26.885
<i> about being super sad.</i>

27:27.037 --> 27:28.687
126, you're on an open channel.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.358
Excuse me.

27:33.635 --> 27:35.486
All right, Strickland,
take off your gear.

27:35.637 --> 27:37.212
-I'm going up.
-Why?

27:37.305 --> 27:39.990
Because I'm the captain.
I get to do what I want.

27:40.217 --> 27:42.159
And for those of you
who are wondering,

27:42.386 --> 27:45.237
I am not sad,
I am not depressed,

27:45.389 --> 27:49.124
<i> despite what some blabbermouth</i>
<i> might have told you.</i>

28:07.853 --> 28:09.077
Hey, Shawn.

28:09.096 --> 28:11.747
My name's Owen. How you doing?

28:11.765 --> 28:13.173
Leave me alone.

28:13.267 --> 28:15.434
Well, I wish I could, buddy.

28:15.528 --> 28:17.602
Your mom's worried about you,
and I promised her

28:17.697 --> 28:18.770
I'd bring you down.

28:18.923 --> 28:20.513
I don't want to go down.

28:20.607 --> 28:23.200
All right, well, we don't have
to do it right this minute,

28:23.351 --> 28:26.870
but I got to put this on you
to keep you safe, okay?

28:27.097 --> 28:28.747
Hands up. There you go.

28:31.526 --> 28:33.526
Hey.

28:33.546 --> 28:36.255
-You mind if I join you?
-I don't care.

28:39.443 --> 28:42.461
(exhales sharply)
Yeah, this is pretty great.

28:42.613 --> 28:44.112
I guess.

28:44.206 --> 28:45.614
Man, I get it.

28:45.632 --> 28:47.891
Sometimes you just want
to be alone.

28:48.118 --> 28:50.060
I'm always by myself.

28:50.212 --> 28:52.212
No one even came
to my birthday party.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.732
I have no friends.

28:54.883 --> 28:56.959
I don't think that's true.

28:57.052 --> 28:58.460
It is.

28:58.479 --> 29:00.145
Well, your mom told me
you just moved here.

29:00.297 --> 29:01.513
You'll make friends.

29:01.574 --> 29:03.240
I just think
you got to give it a minute.

29:03.391 --> 29:06.059
No. I don't want any friends.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.328
Friends suck.

29:09.840 --> 29:14.752
Well, there's some truth
to that, I'm not gonna lie.

29:14.979 --> 29:17.479
Sometimes friends are
more trouble than they're worth.

29:17.572 --> 29:19.498
If they're not nagging you
to your face,

29:19.650 --> 29:21.166
they're talking about you
behind your back,

29:21.260 --> 29:23.260
or forming little cabals.

29:23.411 --> 29:25.078
And two shots
of premium tequila,

29:25.172 --> 29:28.006
and they're betraying
confidences.

29:28.100 --> 29:32.519
I think I want to go down now.

29:34.940 --> 29:38.108
Okeydokey. Let's go.

29:41.021 --> 29:43.363
(sighs)

29:50.623 --> 29:51.530
(knock on window)

29:51.624 --> 29:54.124
Oh, Tommy,
I'm so happy to see you.

29:54.351 --> 29:56.293
-Thank you for coming, friend.
-Of course, honey.

29:56.520 --> 29:59.112
How long have you
been sitting here?

29:59.131 --> 30:01.114
About six hours, give or take.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.634
You waited six hours to call?

30:03.785 --> 30:05.544
Does Judd know you're here?

30:05.696 --> 30:08.547
-Well, I didn't want to bug him
while he was on shift, Tommy.
-Gracie...

30:08.699 --> 30:11.558
-All right, let's check you out.
-I'm okay.

30:13.370 --> 30:15.037
Are you having any trouble
breathing?

30:15.055 --> 30:18.315
-No.
-No? Any chest pain?

30:19.652 --> 30:21.710
All right.

30:21.728 --> 30:22.986
Where does it hurt?

30:23.213 --> 30:26.214
My legs. My back.

30:26.233 --> 30:28.492
-Ego's pretty busted.
-Mm. Well,

30:28.643 --> 30:31.069
at least you didn't go hungry,
which is good,

30:31.163 --> 30:34.314
'cause you can't take these
on an empty stomach.

30:34.408 --> 30:37.059
-They'll help with the pain
and relax your muscles.
-Uh...

30:37.077 --> 30:39.227
But, Tommy, this is not gonna
hurt the baby?

30:39.321 --> 30:41.246
-No.
-All right.

30:41.398 --> 30:44.490
But you could have.
Stressing your body like this?

30:44.585 --> 30:46.084
Girl, come on.
What were you thinking?

30:46.236 --> 30:48.828
I really wanted some rocky road.

30:48.922 --> 30:50.830
-Really bad.
-Oh, uh-huh.

30:50.924 --> 30:52.182
There's an app for that.

30:52.409 --> 30:55.561
Or you could have called
your parents or Charles.

30:57.264 --> 31:00.357
Tommy, I don't know how
to be this person.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.268
You are the same person, Gracie.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.345
You just can't do
the same things.

31:05.439 --> 31:07.847
And you won't be able to,
not for a while.

31:07.867 --> 31:09.274
Well, way to give a pep talk, T.

31:09.426 --> 31:11.276
(chuckles)
Yeah. You know, I know.

31:11.428 --> 31:16.689
Right? People expect women,
especially Black women,

31:16.709 --> 31:19.692
to just be on it 24/7.

31:19.712 --> 31:23.863
Handle your husband,
your-your household, your job

31:23.883 --> 31:27.109
like a boss all day, every day.

31:27.202 --> 31:31.613
But God only gave us this...
this one body.

31:31.632 --> 31:34.616
And as much as you and I
hate to admit it, we are human.

31:34.709 --> 31:39.955
Gracie, asking for help
doesn't mean that you're weak.

31:39.973 --> 31:41.957
It means you're wise.

31:42.050 --> 31:44.717
(sighs heavily)

31:44.737 --> 31:46.144
(both chuckle)

31:46.296 --> 31:48.146
And what are you doing?

31:48.240 --> 31:49.814
I'm driving you home.

31:49.967 --> 31:51.466
That pill I gave you

31:51.485 --> 31:54.152
should relax your muscles enough
to move again

31:54.246 --> 31:56.914
-by the time we get there.
-(scoffs) What? Tommy!

31:57.065 --> 31:59.975
What about your car?

32:00.068 --> 32:02.644
I will rideshare.

32:02.737 --> 32:05.997
-See, I know how to use my apps.
-(laughs)

32:06.091 --> 32:07.999
You're a good friend,
Tommy Vega.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.001
We got each other's backs.

32:10.154 --> 32:11.211
Yeah.

32:12.339 --> 32:15.098
So does that include
not telling my husband

32:15.250 --> 32:18.418
you found me stuck
in my own back seat?

32:18.512 --> 32:20.178
Oh, no, ma'am.
I'll leave that to you.

32:20.272 --> 32:23.148
-I appreciate that.
-(both laugh)

32:23.834 --> 32:25.359

32:35.788 --> 32:37.287
What the...?

32:37.397 --> 32:39.014
TK? What are you doing here?

32:39.032 --> 32:40.248
Get up, Dad.

32:41.351 --> 32:44.795
You seem peevish.
Are you peevish?

32:44.946 --> 32:47.130
I'm not peevish. I'm pissed.

32:47.357 --> 32:49.508
How long you been
hiding this from me?

32:49.693 --> 32:50.783
Hiding what?

32:50.803 --> 32:52.027
That you're depressed.

32:52.045 --> 32:54.879
Oh, they got to you, too, huh?

32:55.032 --> 32:57.457
Look, I am... (chuckles)
not depressed.

32:57.551 --> 33:00.978
When's the last time you slept
until 2:30 in the afternoon?

33:01.129 --> 33:02.871
-It's 2:30?
-Yeah.

33:02.964 --> 33:07.109
Grab a shower, get dressed,
meet me downstairs.

33:07.894 --> 33:10.545
Why? We going somewhere?

33:10.564 --> 33:12.047
TK!

33:12.065 --> 33:15.325
TK, if you're gonna be
so mysterious,

33:15.477 --> 33:18.620
you could at least give me
some guidance on footwear.

33:21.742 --> 33:25.002
And it's everybody.

33:25.229 --> 33:27.629
Dad, please have a seat.

33:30.234 --> 33:33.068
This better be
somebody's birthday.

33:33.161 --> 33:34.177
No, but mine's coming up.

33:34.329 --> 33:36.263
PAUL:
No, probie, no.

33:37.499 --> 33:39.924
Why does everybody look
like somebody died?

33:40.019 --> 33:43.729
We're here to talk about
your emotional wellness.

33:45.006 --> 33:46.523
Just-just please hear us out.

33:46.750 --> 33:48.933
Okay? And know that
this is a safe space,

33:49.028 --> 33:50.268
and there is
absolutely no judgment.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.845
Says the guy who just lured me
into an ambush.

33:52.865 --> 33:54.180
TK:
We both know that I've been

33:54.199 --> 33:56.015
in your chair
in more than one of these.

33:56.035 --> 33:59.094
And I know how tempting it is

33:59.112 --> 34:00.871
to want to bristle
and shut down.

34:01.098 --> 34:02.188
I'm not bristling.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.874
Carlos, am I bristling?

34:04.025 --> 34:06.284
Oh, y-you seem like

34:06.436 --> 34:10.380
you're understandably
on alert, Captain.

34:10.532 --> 34:14.593
For the love of God,
just call me Owen.

34:15.962 --> 34:17.946
All right, let's hear it.
Come on.

34:17.964 --> 34:20.115
Uh, read your opening
statements.

34:20.133 --> 34:21.299
Wait, we were supposed
to write statements?

34:21.393 --> 34:23.468
No. Relax, probie,
just talk from the heart.

34:23.562 --> 34:26.730
Yeah, exactly, Marjan.
Why don't you go first?

34:26.881 --> 34:28.957
-Me?
-Mm-hmm.

34:28.975 --> 34:30.716
Okay.

34:30.736 --> 34:31.902
Yeah, um...

34:32.011 --> 34:33.386
Cap.

34:33.405 --> 34:37.074
When you brought me here
from Miami,

34:37.225 --> 34:39.651
uh, you changed my life.

34:39.745 --> 34:43.246
And no boss has ever shown

34:43.473 --> 34:45.657
the belief in me that you have.

34:45.751 --> 34:49.294
And... uh...

34:50.831 --> 34:52.071
I want you to know that

34:52.165 --> 34:56.343
you are the best cap ever.

34:57.504 --> 34:59.838
This is a good intervention.
I like this.

34:59.990 --> 35:01.414
That's it?

35:01.433 --> 35:02.582
Yeah, that's it.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.659
Is there something
you want to say, Judd?

35:04.719 --> 35:06.686
Yeah. Uh...

35:08.089 --> 35:09.998
Yeah, you're depressed.

35:10.091 --> 35:11.683
-Everybody knows it.
-I'm not depressed.

35:11.835 --> 35:16.095
I d-- I don't know
where you're all getting this.

35:16.189 --> 35:18.840
I have nothing
to be depressed about.

35:18.933 --> 35:20.175
I'm fine.

35:20.193 --> 35:21.601
And that's why we're worried.

35:21.695 --> 35:23.269
Now, you were planning
for an entire future,

35:23.288 --> 35:25.029
and it got ripped out
from right under you,

35:25.182 --> 35:26.623
and you're "fine"?

35:26.774 --> 35:30.702
Yeah. Because I know
how to roll with the punches.

35:30.854 --> 35:31.870
JUDD:
No, you don't.

35:32.022 --> 35:33.279
You take the punches.

35:33.340 --> 35:36.875
And then if they stop,
uh, you go find some more.

35:36.969 --> 35:38.451
TK:
Like, you've always been

35:38.545 --> 35:41.045
a-a "grin and bear it"
kind of guy, okay?

35:41.198 --> 35:43.548
But I believe
that you're suffering from...

35:43.700 --> 35:45.458
smiling depression.

35:45.477 --> 35:48.461
(laughs) Smiling depression?
Is that a thing?

35:48.555 --> 35:50.630
-It's a thing.
-PAUL: It's when you use

35:50.649 --> 35:53.224
an upbeat attitude
to mask the fact that...

35:53.377 --> 35:55.727
you're not really taking care
of yourself.

35:55.879 --> 35:57.487
I'm not taking care of myself?

35:57.639 --> 36:00.215
I'm sorry, is there anybody else
in this room

36:00.308 --> 36:02.066
who has a six-step
skin care regimen?

36:02.161 --> 36:05.996
No one takes self-care
more seriously than I do.

36:06.165 --> 36:08.999
Then why did you cancel
your surgery?

36:09.150 --> 36:10.558
Where'd you hear that?

36:10.652 --> 36:12.894
-Mateo.
-Where'd
<i> you</i>
hear that?

36:12.913 --> 36:14.671
From you. When you told me.

36:14.822 --> 36:17.081
I did not tell you,
because that is not a thing

36:17.234 --> 36:18.991
that I would tell you.

36:19.085 --> 36:20.326
You were pretty bombed.

36:20.420 --> 36:21.419
Well, so were you.

36:21.571 --> 36:23.847
So whose memory
are we gonna trust?

36:23.998 --> 36:25.757
His or mine?

36:25.851 --> 36:26.850
Is it true or ain't it?

36:27.001 --> 36:29.427
Yeah.

36:29.579 --> 36:31.746
I canceled the surgery. And
it's not because I'm depressed.

36:31.765 --> 36:34.599
And it's not because
I have some death wish.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.842
It, uh...

36:36.862 --> 36:39.029
You were in the hospital.

36:39.256 --> 36:41.281
Well, you drove off of a bridge.

36:42.092 --> 36:43.533
I was needed.

36:43.685 --> 36:45.035
-Of course you were needed, Cap.
-Straight-up.

36:45.262 --> 36:46.594
Always.

36:46.705 --> 36:49.447
Dad, you need to call Dr. Jacobs
and reschedule your surgery.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.691
-And I will.
-When? It took you months

36:51.710 --> 36:53.785
to come around
and schedule the first one.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.103
And the only reason you did

36:55.196 --> 36:57.105
is because you were
gonna be a father.

36:57.198 --> 36:58.698
I was already a father.

36:58.717 --> 37:02.868
And I will forever regret that
unfortunate choice of words.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.537
And there were other reasons.

37:04.631 --> 37:06.372
Volcano.

37:06.466 --> 37:08.558
-Wildfire.
-TK: There will always be

37:08.710 --> 37:10.618
some sort of excuse, Dad.

37:10.637 --> 37:13.304
Another reason for you
to kick the can down the road,

37:13.457 --> 37:16.233
and that's what
depressed people do.

37:20.722 --> 37:23.365
What if the surgery
isn't successful?

37:24.910 --> 37:27.577
What if they, uh,

37:27.804 --> 37:30.062
can't get it all?

37:30.082 --> 37:31.990
Look, you're not afraid

37:32.125 --> 37:34.976
that they're not gonna get
all the cancer.

37:34.995 --> 37:36.360
You're afraid that they will

37:36.513 --> 37:38.070
and you'll lose
your biggest excuse

37:38.090 --> 37:40.072
for feeling sorry for yourself.

37:40.166 --> 37:42.592
Okay, I think we're done here.

37:42.744 --> 37:44.243
All right, fine.

37:44.263 --> 37:46.412
We came here to say
what we needed to say.

Uh, Paul said I could

38:04.098 --> 38:05.840
crash at his place tonight. I...
