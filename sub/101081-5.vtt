NEWSMAN:
A teenage girl has been
taken into custody

00:09.844 --> 00:11.470
following an attack
on the Belgian offices

00:11.512 --> 00:12.930
of Passway Pharmaceuticals,

00:12.972 --> 00:14.515
during which
two people were killed.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.893
The incident, which took place
during a medical research trial

00:17.935 --> 00:20.312
being conducted
on young volunteers, has led

00:20.354 --> 00:21.939
to heightened security
in the area.

00:21.981 --> 00:24.567
Passway denies
all responsibility,

00:24.650 --> 00:26.152
though the company concedes
the suspect

00:26.193 --> 00:28.195
was one
of the trial participants.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.746
Dumont.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.247
CARMICHAEL:
This is Carmichael.

00:38.289 --> 00:39.540
Did you get the file?

00:39.582 --> 00:40.875
Yeah.

00:40.916 --> 00:42.168
What do we know about this girl?

00:42.168 --> 00:43.544
Monica Gastner.

00:43.586 --> 00:45.337
History of anxiety
and depression,

00:45.379 --> 00:47.339
which we think she lied about
on the form.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.550
She have a history of violence?

00:49.592 --> 00:51.051
Nothing on her record.

00:51.093 --> 00:53.012
You have police there?

00:53.053 --> 00:54.764
I've been here all night
talking to them.

00:54.805 --> 00:57.099
I've kept them away
from the storage area.

00:57.141 --> 00:59.518
Your shipment
for the Meadows is secure.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.104
Yeah, well,
I'm not taking that risk.

01:02.146 --> 01:04.690
Accelerate delivery.
Do it yourself.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.279
LEO:
Mia?

01:09.361 --> 01:11.906
HANNA:
If we're never going to leave,

01:10.321 --> 01:12.907
Will you come with me?

01:11.947 --> 01:14.033
then why are you training me?

01:16.160 --> 01:17.495
ERIK:
Because one day,

01:17.578 --> 01:19.205
I may not be here
to protect you,

01:19.246 --> 01:21.457
and you'll have to cope
on your own.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.422
Hands on the wall.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.380
What do you need?

01:31.550 --> 01:34.595
Where are you taking me?

01:34.637 --> 01:37.306
I have the right to know.

01:48.651 --> 01:49.985
This way.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.619
Just in here.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.297
KIM:
This is Central.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.299
MARISSA:
Kim, it's Wiegler.
I'm just calling

02:12.341 --> 02:13.926
to say that I won't be in today.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.803
-Okay.
-Tell Sonia, please.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.345
CARMICHAEL:
Let's talk about Mia.

02:15.845 --> 02:17.429
Uh, she just called in.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.681
She's not gonna be here, either.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.975
Her name is Hanna.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.140
Did she say why?

02:20.182 --> 02:21.892
She just said it was personal.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.936
Okay. Thanks, Kim.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.216
You gonna talk to me?

02:54.258 --> 02:56.510
Why?

02:56.552 --> 02:59.972
Because I came for you,
and if I hadn't, you'd be dead.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.774
Still no sign.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.570
I don't know.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.363
Is this Clara's?

03:14.612 --> 03:16.614
I don't know what the fuck
this is.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.243
There's a place
called the Meadows.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.411
All right, will do.

03:21.285 --> 03:23.245
It's where they've taken her.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.498
You know it?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.792
But they didn't tell me
where it is.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.794
I saw this man

03:30.711 --> 03:32.212
LEO:
You know Terri?

03:30.836 --> 03:34.173
writing about it on a computer
last night in Passway.

03:32.254 --> 03:35.507
Hi, Mia. Nice to meet you.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.217
He was writing about sending
a shipment of drugs.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.802
I work back-of-house.

03:38.844 --> 03:41.013
What does that mean?

03:39.219 --> 03:41.180
I remember his face.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.596
:
All trainees,

03:40.638 --> 03:42.264
please gather all your affairs

03:41.055 --> 03:45.184
Identity creation
and maintenance.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.848
If we can find him,

03:42.306 --> 03:44.099
and collect
at meeting point "G"

03:42.890 --> 03:44.475
he could lead us to Clara.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.976
for immediate onward...

03:44.516 --> 03:47.186
Hanna, listen to me.

03:46.018 --> 03:48.520
Where are we going?
Why do they keep moving us?

03:46.769 --> 03:48.771
So you make up their names,
their families

03:47.227 --> 03:49.939
Clara is gone.
You can't save her.

03:48.562 --> 03:52.191
WOMAN:
Further information
will be given in transit.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.689
and their pretend lives.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.399
If you do what I say,
you fly to Canada today,

03:52.441 --> 03:53.817
then you're safe.

03:52.524 --> 03:53.484
Yes, I do.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.611
Well, I don't need one.

03:55.653 --> 03:58.280
I already have a name.

03:55.861 --> 03:59.406
She will escape,
or try to again.

03:59.448 --> 04:01.659
And they will kill her.

03:59.865 --> 04:00.866
I understand.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.661
It's my fault.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.411
What happened to Marissa?

04:03.702 --> 04:05.704
Not your fault.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.166
Marissa is gone.

04:09.124 --> 04:10.459
Go looking for that place,

04:10.501 --> 04:11.794
they'll see you,
they'll know you're alive.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.837
Everything we've been working on
will be ruined.

04:12.461 --> 04:14.463
This can be your home now.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.217
You're dead to them right now.
You have to stay that way.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.260
You lied to Clara.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.848
You told her
you were her mother.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.851
You gave her hope so that
they could take her back.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.895
How could you do that?

04:31.897 --> 04:34.608
I did it for you.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.319
:
We are approaching
our destination.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.612
I never asked you to.

04:37.361 --> 04:40.656
All trainees should prepare
for disembarkation.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.035
She can't live in that place.

04:45.077 --> 04:48.956
If we don't do something,
she will die.

04:48.330 --> 04:51.792
M. Wiegler, August 12.

04:48.998 --> 04:51.333
What do you suggest?

04:51.375 --> 04:52.918
That we find her.

04:51.834 --> 04:55.212
Interview commencing at
11:47 a.m.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.753
Welcome to the Meadows.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.503
Together.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.089
Where is Hanna?

04:58.841 --> 05:00.384
CARMICHAEL:
How'd she sleep?

04:58.924 --> 05:00.134
Where is she?

05:00.175 --> 05:02.720
I have a few questions
of my own.

05:00.426 --> 05:01.802
TERRI:
She didn't.

05:01.844 --> 05:03.804
CARMICHAEL:
Is she talking to you?

05:03.846 --> 05:05.931
TERRI:
Not yet.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.933
I have to put a deadline
on this.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.518
Sir...

05:09.560 --> 05:11.520
She's a drag on the boat.

05:11.437 --> 05:13.605
You want to take a look?

05:11.562 --> 05:13.522
We can change that.

05:13.564 --> 05:15.983
And you think the others
will welcome her back?

05:15.274 --> 05:17.401
No, thank you.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.946
It's...

05:19.820 --> 05:23.032
I'm gonna let you guys
get on with this.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.948
not impossible.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.909
I'll give you two days.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.075
It's great to see you
again, Mia.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.995
Then I make the call.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.707
MAN:
Marissa.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.709
-John.
-Ah.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.501
It's okay.

05:33.751 --> 05:35.502
Wasn't sure you'd recognize me.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.171
We have time.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.755
It's been a while.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.298
We didn't find your phone,
but we were able

05:37.796 --> 05:40.007
How's your leg? Getting better?

05:39.381 --> 05:41.300
to access your records,
which showed that you were

05:40.049 --> 05:42.968
Uh, it's been better
for two weeks.

05:41.383 --> 05:44.636
with Hanna in Belgium,
which means you lied to us.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.970
Why are you here?

05:46.013 --> 05:48.057
Well, I'm afraid
there are a few issues

05:47.181 --> 05:49.099
You knew about
Sonia Richter's death.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.267
that need clearing up.

05:49.141 --> 05:50.809
I have a hunch
you even assisted.

05:50.309 --> 05:53.896
Around what happened
at the Utrax facility.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.644
You have no evidence of that.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.855
Nor do I have any evidence
you killed Jerome Sawyer,

05:53.937 --> 05:55.939
How do you even know about that?

05:54.897 --> 05:56.899
but you did.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.779
I don't want to waste
too much of your time.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.239
Let's talk about Paris.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.822
Shall we begin?

06:04.281 --> 06:06.241
You harbored Hanna,
found her a safe house,

06:04.948 --> 06:07.493
Mm-hmm.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.951
visited her there.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.536
WOMAN:
Who is this?

06:07.993 --> 06:11.789
Arranged a whole new identity,
a new life.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.538
MARISSA:
This is Marissa Wiegler.

06:11.580 --> 06:14.750
I'm at the Utrax facility.

06:11.830 --> 06:13.832
Canada.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.668
An old geography professor
of yours

06:14.792 --> 06:17.544
Jerome Sawyer's dead.
I'm wounded.

06:16.710 --> 06:20.672
by the name of Thomas Kaladski.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.880
-Erik Heller shot me.
-

06:18.003 --> 06:19.963
-Are you there?
-HANNA: Yes.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.341
I can't see him.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.508
I need assistance.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.343
-Okay, stay outside.
I won't be long.
-

06:22.549 --> 06:24.134
WOMAN:
Where is Heller?

06:24.176 --> 06:25.803
MARISSA:
He's gone,

06:24.384 --> 06:27.096
If you see him, call me.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.930
but he's badly injured.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.138
And a new passport,

06:27.137 --> 06:28.764
J'arrive.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.640
He won't survive.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.723
acquired from a certain
Hafeez Mustafa

06:29.681 --> 06:31.683
WOMAN:
And the girl?

06:29.765 --> 06:32.726
in St. Denis.
Where is that passport now?

06:31.183 --> 06:33.018
Salut.

06:32.768 --> 06:35.687
What passport?

06:33.102 --> 06:34.728
MARISSA:
She, uh...

06:34.770 --> 06:36.146
she got away.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.943
So let me get this straight.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.945
-Heller killed Jerome Sawyer.
-Mm-hmm.

06:41.193 --> 06:42.861
Who was this for?

06:42.986 --> 06:45.531
He was escaping with Hanna
and the other girl.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.865
Was it for Hanna?

06:45.572 --> 06:46.782
I tried to stop them.

06:46.824 --> 06:48.826
-And he shot you in the leg?
-Mm-hmm.

06:52.121 --> 06:54.915
Or is there someone else
involved we don't know about?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.541
Why were you there?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.709
Sawyer's report seems to suggest

06:56.667 --> 06:58.919
Who removed the bug that
we placed in your apartment

06:57.751 --> 07:00.170
that you shouldn't have been
on that operation at all.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.963
There's no point doing this.

06:58.961 --> 07:00.087
in Paris?

07:00.129 --> 07:02.297
Who's helping you?

07:01.004 --> 07:02.548
What am I doing?

07:01.213 --> 07:03.507
Sawyer and I
didn't see eye to eye

07:02.589 --> 07:05.050
Trying to make me
the same as the others.

07:03.549 --> 07:07.261
on how to address Erik's
reemergence from the forest.

07:04.007 --> 07:07.469
Did you hope someone
would find you, Marissa?

07:05.092 --> 07:07.761
But I'm not the same.
I think different.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.472
And how do you know
what the others are thinking?

07:09.888 --> 07:13.809
Well, you were right
about Heller.

07:10.514 --> 07:12.474
I can tell.

07:10.681 --> 07:13.016
Lock her up.

07:12.516 --> 07:15.102
They don't question things
the way I do.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.018
And then what?

07:14.852 --> 07:16.728
He didn't make it.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.312
-You'll see.
-What about Hanna?

07:15.144 --> 07:17.229
It's not a bad thing
to question.

07:17.271 --> 07:18.647
It is here.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.773
Mia stays here.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.399
The girls buried him
in a rural graveyard.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.775
Where she belongs.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.651
Next to the mother.
Sentimental reasons, I imagine.

07:21.150 --> 07:23.986
Why did you sleep in my room?

07:23.694 --> 07:24.820
We disposed of him

07:24.027 --> 07:25.988
Did you think
you'd get to know me?

07:24.862 --> 07:27.447
in a more strategic fashion.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.407
You won't.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.449
Hmm.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.409
If this is a test,
I will fail it,

07:29.491 --> 07:32.661
Um, would you care
to come with me for a moment?

07:30.450 --> 07:32.536
so maybe you should
just give up now.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.788
I have no intention
of giving up.

07:34.830 --> 07:36.957
Why do you care?
You're just doing a job.

07:39.001 --> 07:41.003
I don't know.

07:42.588 --> 07:45.090
I understand what it is
to be the odd one out

07:45.132 --> 07:46.675
in every situation.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.509
Where are we going?

07:47.551 --> 07:48.927
It's right down here.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.929
Do you have a mother?

07:48.969 --> 07:50.387
Won't take long.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.306
Yes, I do.

07:51.638 --> 07:53.640
Through this door.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.894
Then don't try and pretend
you and I are the same.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.896
We're not even close.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.439
I don't understand.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.315
So how could you
possibly understand?

08:00.480 --> 08:02.441
What's in there?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.359
Don't worry, Marissa.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.403
It's just me.

08:05.694 --> 08:08.447
Mia Wolff, aged 18.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.200
Born in Dresden, and now lives
in Rutland, Vermont.

08:09.698 --> 08:10.949
Richter.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.951
Hi, it's Marissa.

08:11.241 --> 08:14.828
Mia loves nature, hiking
and being outdoors.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.204
How can I help?

08:14.870 --> 08:18.040
She's strong, smart,
independent,

08:15.245 --> 08:16.830
Listen, I-I've been thinking

08:15.829 --> 08:17.539
So...

08:16.872 --> 08:19.166
that I owe you an apology
for what I said.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.667
and can adjust quickly
to new environments.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.834
Let's go back to the beginning.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.751
I mean, you were only
doing your job.

08:20.709 --> 08:24.630
She has a dog,
a black Labrador named Buttons.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.294
If I'm gonna be pissed
at anyone,

08:22.336 --> 08:23.670
it should be Carmichael.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.379
MAN:
We have the results

08:23.712 --> 08:24.838
Don't worry about it.

08:24.421 --> 08:27.424
of your ALC training tests.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.799
Buttons is a stupid name
for a dog.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.466
Well, I would like us
to get past it,

08:27.466 --> 08:29.176
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, sir.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.801
so I was thinking maybe
we could start with a coffee.

08:29.218 --> 08:30.677
So, you think you're ready?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.220
I'm available this afternoon,

08:30.719 --> 08:32.554
Well, I'd rather not sit
at a training console

08:31.053 --> 08:32.137
You're right.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.222
if you're around.

08:32.596 --> 08:34.723
-for another year.
-That's good.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.474
This afternoon's gonna be tough.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.599
Chester?

08:34.765 --> 08:37.893
-So, we can put you
straight on the NSA main floor.
-Mm-hmm.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.517
Uh, how about
sometime next week?

08:37.559 --> 08:39.561
Sure, that works.

08:37.935 --> 08:39.603
You'd be assigned to a desk.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.937
Hmm.

08:39.603 --> 08:41.188
We don't have
to decide anything now

08:39.645 --> 08:41.605
Comms and SIGINT analysis.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.357
except for the fact
that I'm buying.

08:41.647 --> 08:42.940
Phone calls.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.816
Cryptographic decoding.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.817
I'll hold you to that.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.485
It's the usual process

08:45.859 --> 08:47.861
Good.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.487
for someone transitioning
from military intelligence

08:47.444 --> 08:50.113
So, she has a brother
named Nico.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.948
to an analysis-led arena.

08:50.155 --> 08:53.575
He's fun. Kind of a show-off.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.534
Or?

08:53.617 --> 08:56.703
Her mother works in
Human Resources.

08:55.577 --> 08:58.372
There is another possibility.

08:56.745 --> 09:00.415
Her father works as
a management consultant.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.791
It's in the field.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.793
It's kind of unusual.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.794
Bon.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.212
Classified project.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.295
Maybe not a consultant?

09:05.254 --> 09:07.214
And we would only want you
to do it

09:07.256 --> 09:09.508
if you felt it was right for you
at this time.

09:08.382 --> 09:12.427
How about environmental law?

09:09.549 --> 09:11.551
Okay. Merci.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.802
Where is it?

09:11.843 --> 09:13.595
Abroad.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.680
Fuck.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.055
That's a little vague, sir.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.640
A doctor?

09:17.099 --> 09:18.433
If you're interested,

09:17.975 --> 09:22.980
Mia Wolff, born April 22, 2001.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.018
I'd have to ask you to sign this

09:20.060 --> 09:22.229
before I tell you anything more.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.398
Favorite food, bananas.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.483
Second-favorite food,
curly fries.

09:26.525 --> 09:27.985
Favorite animal, capybara.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.070
Second-favorite animal,
Chester.

09:30.112 --> 09:33.282
Favorite subject, languages.
Least-favorite subject, history.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.784
-Mia...
-It's not difficult to pretend
to be someone else.

09:35.826 --> 09:37.828
I've done it before.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.583
We're not asking you to pretend.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.543
Welcome.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.919
Then what are you asking?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.962
-

09:48.797 --> 09:52.050
I understand your anger.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.511
You're not like the others.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.096
You've seen the world.

09:58.765 --> 10:02.352
But let me say something
very simple to you.

10:00.559 --> 10:02.144
WOMAN:
Due to increased security,

10:02.185 --> 10:04.646
staff are urged
to wear their security passes

10:02.394 --> 10:04.771
If you want to live
in that world,

10:04.688 --> 10:06.356
at all times.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.898
I'm your best chance
of doing so.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.734
Police will be questioning
members of staff...

10:08.400 --> 10:12.779
Hanna Petrescu will be hunted
all her life.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.364
Mia Wolff will be safe

10:14.406 --> 10:18.368
and... loved...

10:20.746 --> 10:22.748
...and happy.

10:25.542 --> 10:27.544
It's your choice.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.503
ERIK:
I wish we could
stay here forever.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.507
Why don't you go and
think about it?

10:32.507 --> 10:35.469
I can feel your heartbeat.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.518
You feel it?

10:45.020 --> 10:46.980
What is that?

10:48.982 --> 10:50.650
Nothing.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.195
Did they give it to you?

10:53.236 --> 10:55.655
They said it keeps us calm.

10:56.698 --> 10:57.908
What are you doing?

11:00.118 --> 11:01.912
SANDY:
Hey, Mia.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.955
Mia.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.250
It's okay.
Come sit with us.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.213
Where's Clara?

11:11.254 --> 11:14.883
Clemency's at training,
then she'll join us.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.469
Sit. Eat with us.

11:15.467 --> 11:18.011
You don't need this anymore.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.357
Are you angry with Clemency?

11:29.106 --> 11:31.108
OFFICER:
Jamal?

11:32.901 --> 11:34.319
Okay?

11:32.901 --> 11:34.486
Don't be.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.530
She just did what
she thought was best.

11:36.113 --> 11:37.906
Welcome, everybody.

11:37.948 --> 11:40.033
My name's Leo Garner.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.953
Can I see your file?

11:40.075 --> 11:42.077
Please take your seats.

11:42.994 --> 11:46.289
"Mia Wolff."

11:45.080 --> 11:49.042
So... let's make a start.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.874
That's a really nice name.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.918
I love your house.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.044
WOMAN:
Hi, there.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.711
-It's really pretty.
-JULES: Let me guess.

11:51.086 --> 11:54.047
My name's Joanne McCoy,
and I'm your group leader.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.131
Smart, middle-class,
heteronormative

11:54.089 --> 11:57.050
You're now entering the second
stage of your development.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.382
all-American girl.

11:55.424 --> 11:56.967
There's nothing wrong with
being American, Jules.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.260
You're American.

11:57.092 --> 11:58.885
You're gonna notice some changes

11:58.301 --> 11:59.636
I'm not all-American.

11:58.927 --> 12:01.096
in the way we work
here at the Meadows.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.304
Well, you're more American
than Mia.

12:01.138 --> 12:03.014
You're gonna have more freedom,

12:01.346 --> 12:04.808
HELEN:
Whoa, your dad's German.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.226
and you're gonna be able
to ask more questions of us.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.393
Do you speak German?

12:06.268 --> 12:10.105
Medication will be reduced
and rules relaxed

12:10.147 --> 12:13.775
as we prepare you for the next
stage of your journey.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.861
You'll shortly receive your
personalized character profile

12:15.902 --> 12:17.487
that will tell you
all you need to know

12:15.986 --> 12:16.945
You have a brother.

12:16.987 --> 12:20.115
Nico. Good name.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.114
about your new identities.

12:19.156 --> 12:20.949
Take time to read it.

12:20.157 --> 12:22.451
I have a sister. Jodie.

12:20.991 --> 12:23.618
It contains all you need
to know about yourself,

12:22.492 --> 12:24.077
She's younger than me.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.996
your family history,
your schooling,

12:24.119 --> 12:25.287
:
She's sick,

12:25.328 --> 12:28.707
but we're
helping her through it.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.831
your place of birth,
where you grew up,

12:26.913 --> 12:29.875
Hey, how's my favorite trainee?

12:27.873 --> 12:29.416
your hobbies and interests,

12:28.748 --> 12:30.208
HELEN:
Your brother's kind of cute.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.461
your aspirations
and your dreams.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.419
JULES:
Helen, you have a crush
everyone's brother.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.462
Shit.

12:32.461 --> 12:34.087
You were into Jessie's,
and he's 12.

12:33.503 --> 12:34.754
Doesn't matter.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.798
It's just skin.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.260
CARMICHAEL:
Operation Utrax.

12:38.633 --> 12:39.968
Where is she?

12:40.010 --> 12:41.011
Clara?

12:40.302 --> 12:43.805
Initiated in 2002,
Darabani, Romania,

12:41.052 --> 12:42.888
She's in isolation.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.181
She shouldn't be
allowed to be in here.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.807
to explore in utero enhancement

12:44.222 --> 12:45.932
-She's not safe.
-Fine by me.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.558
Hey, Clemency.

12:45.849 --> 12:48.310
of genetic makeup
in early-stage embryos.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.477
I don't like her
any more than you do.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.268
What's up?

12:48.351 --> 12:52.772
Wolf DNA implanted
into a three-month-old fetus,

12:50.312 --> 12:51.480
What's this?

12:51.521 --> 12:53.815
Oh, that arrived for you.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.691
to affect bone density,

12:53.857 --> 12:55.650
From your parents.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.067
sensory sensibility

12:55.692 --> 12:58.778
Apparently you used to love
reading it as a little girl?

12:56.109 --> 12:58.528
and reduced susceptibility
to disease.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.570
CLARA:
They gave you this?

12:58.570 --> 13:01.281
All with the intention
of creating

12:58.612 --> 13:01.156
Can I see?

13:00.071 --> 13:01.740
I don't remember that.

13:01.323 --> 13:03.658
a perfectly refined
military tool.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.993
I went to Sunday school
for years,

13:03.700 --> 13:05.285
Did you know about it
all these years?

13:05.327 --> 13:07.496
I thought I was keeping it
secret from you.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.830
I can barely remember
a thing they taught us.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.331
I was the one
who recommended you.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.793
You closed the operation in 2003

13:13.835 --> 13:17.547
after Erik Heller's
unfortunate intervention.

13:17.047 --> 13:19.174
I like it. It's very you.

13:17.589 --> 13:20.759
-We reopened it in 2004.
-Without telling me.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.470
CARMICHAEL:
It was decided
a clean slate was necessary.

13:23.512 --> 13:27.224
The DNA enhancements
are now synthetic,

13:27.265 --> 13:29.976
modeled on the same material
but now nonorganic.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.060
Are you Monica Gastner?

13:30.018 --> 13:32.312
And this time...

13:30.101 --> 13:32.020
Who are you?

13:32.062 --> 13:34.731
I work for the INL.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.439
it worked.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.899
Where are they?

13:34.773 --> 13:38.109
Investigating the illegal
trade of prescription drugs.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.611
They're
in socialization training,

13:38.151 --> 13:40.487
I've already fucking told them.

13:38.777 --> 13:39.903
FEMALE GUARD:
Get up!

13:39.653 --> 13:41.613
developing their new identities.

13:39.945 --> 13:41.863
I said get up!

13:40.529 --> 13:43.031
Why does nobody believe me?

13:41.655 --> 13:43.615
When socialization is complete,

13:43.073 --> 13:44.783
It wasn't me.

13:43.657 --> 13:46.826
they'll be transferred
into the field.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.160
-It was the girl.
-What girl?

13:47.202 --> 13:50.497
The girl who grabbed me
and gave me the money.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.538
They'll live in the real world,

13:49.579 --> 13:52.082
normally, quietly.

13:51.706 --> 13:54.751
What did she look like,
this girl?

13:52.123 --> 13:53.750
And all we have to do
is flip a switch,

13:53.500 --> 13:56.586
JULES:
First memory, South of France.

13:53.792 --> 13:55.085
and they'll do whatever we ask.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.671
100% deniability.

13:56.294 --> 13:57.587
She took Monica's clothes

13:56.628 --> 14:00.006
It says it was warm,
you were camping.

13:57.629 --> 13:59.214
and consent form.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.256
I mean,

13:59.256 --> 14:02.133
-The same age?
-Yeah, 16 or 17.

13:59.297 --> 14:02.092
who's really gonna suspect
an 18-year-old freshman

14:00.048 --> 14:02.300
SANDY:
I love camping.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.886
in pigtails
of state-sponsored murder?

14:02.175 --> 14:04.511
Does this girl have any
distinguishing features?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.010
JULES:
It was August.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.805
You swam in the river.

14:04.553 --> 14:05.929
Nothing we can use for an I.D.

14:05.971 --> 14:08.181
But apparently she was strong.

14:06.471 --> 14:09.432
And 100% reliable.

14:06.805 --> 14:10.475
The water was cold,
but you weren't scared.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.433
Oh, um, I'll call you back.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.476
Or so we thought.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.143
What's wrong with her arm?

14:10.517 --> 14:13.645
There was birdsong in the trees.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.353
According
to the gospel of Utrax,

14:12.185 --> 14:14.688
We had to implant new meds.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.980
Trainee 249 shouldn't have had

14:13.687 --> 14:18.066
You ate marshmallows
with your dad in the evening,

14:14.729 --> 14:16.398
She cut the old ones out.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.649
the ability to disobey orders
in the way she did.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.569
We need to determine
why that happened

14:18.149 --> 14:19.859
and lay next to each other
at night

14:18.275 --> 14:20.277
Or someone did.

14:19.901 --> 14:22.862
and looked up at the stars.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.821
and how to prevent it
in the future.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.073
To do that,

14:22.904 --> 14:27.826
HELEN: "The size of the sky
and the dark of the night.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.409
we need to bring her back.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.827
That's why I'm here.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.246
The feeling of the wind
as you ran through the trees."

14:30.287 --> 14:32.122
That's why I need your help.

14:31.288 --> 14:33.290
SANDY:
It's beautiful.

14:39.254 --> 14:41.339
JULES: The South of France.
I wonder what that's like.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.550
It's okay.

14:45.135 --> 14:47.345
Took me a while to
get my head around it, too.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.681
Hello?

14:47.387 --> 14:50.807
But you believe it now,
don't you, Clem?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.433
Come on, Hanna.

14:50.849 --> 14:51.933
Sandy was into it immediately.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.018
Answer your phone.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.853
Total fucking believer.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.811
into some trouble

14:54.853 --> 14:57.230
I fought it. It's natural.

14:57.272 --> 15:01.067
You don't think it's weird?

14:58.982 --> 15:01.901
getting doubled

15:00.734 --> 15:02.944
Okay.

15:01.109 --> 15:05.155
Everything's weird.
The world is weird.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.864
Take your time.

15:05.196 --> 15:08.366
JULES:
I read this philosopher.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.283
That's number one.

15:08.325 --> 15:09.367
MONICA:
No.

15:08.408 --> 15:12.370
He said the whole world was
pure illusion.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.410
SONIA:
No?

15:10.452 --> 15:13.830
Number two?

15:12.412 --> 15:15.332
Like shadows dancing
on a cave wall.

15:12.787 --> 15:17.250
and I am crossing over

15:13.872 --> 15:14.956
No.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.333
Not her?

15:15.373 --> 15:18.168
None of it real.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.500
No.

15:18.209 --> 15:21.671
So maybe we're no different
to anyone else.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.713
SONIA:
Number three?

15:20.670 --> 15:22.464
Come on. Let's go.

15:21.713 --> 15:24.883
Maybe it's all a dream.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.591
and we'll call it home

15:24.966 --> 15:29.512
It says my mother and father
are happy together.

15:26.176 --> 15:28.136
Yes, it's her.

15:28.178 --> 15:31.139
I'm good with faces.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.348
Yeah. It's nice, isn't it?

15:31.181 --> 15:33.433
She was blond, but...

15:31.389 --> 15:34.643
My mother died trying
to save my life.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.894
it's her.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.102
Her head was crushed
by a car.

15:36.144 --> 15:39.606
And my father,
the man who raised me,

15:39.648 --> 15:41.900
was killed by Utrax guards.

15:41.900 --> 15:46.780
I buried his body next to
my mother in a Romanian grave.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.905
Well, you're persistent.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.657
And we never ate marshmallows.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.573
I'll give you that.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.574
Where are you?

15:49.616 --> 15:51.493
Driving to a farmers market

15:51.534 --> 15:52.702
in the Eighth arrondissement.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.120
In Paris?

15:52.869 --> 15:53.828
HANNA:
Are you okay?

15:53.870 --> 15:55.705
Hmm?

15:54.162 --> 15:55.330
Well, yes, in Paris.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.706
Why?

15:56.748 --> 15:59.709
Have you heard from Hanna?

15:58.375 --> 16:00.502
GIRL:
Watch where you're going!

15:58.958 --> 16:02.212
Why couldn't we stay in one
of those cabins we steal from?

15:59.751 --> 16:01.753
What do you mean, John?

16:00.543 --> 16:02.671
VIDEO NARRATOR:
This world is not safe.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.381
You told me Hanna was dead.

16:02.253 --> 16:03.630
They're warmer.

16:03.672 --> 16:05.465
It's too close to the edge
of the forest,

16:04.422 --> 16:07.050
Yeah, well,
I might've been wrong.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.758
Society is not stable.

16:05.507 --> 16:07.467
and people come and stay in them
all the time.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.844
Power is not a given.

16:07.092 --> 16:09.135
Stop fucking around.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.053
It's not safe.

16:09.177 --> 16:10.512
Is she alive or not?

16:09.886 --> 16:11.471
The leaders of the free world

16:10.553 --> 16:11.554
I don't know.

16:11.513 --> 16:14.474
are as precariously positioned
as anybody else.

16:11.596 --> 16:13.556
It might've been a false flag.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.350
But if she does try
to contact you,

16:14.516 --> 16:18.561
-As subject to threat
and fear as anybody else.
-

16:15.392 --> 16:17.352
you call me immediately, okay?

16:17.394 --> 16:19.396
Sure.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.690
They need support.
Protection.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.188
Mm.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.232
Let's eat, huh?

16:21.731 --> 16:23.650
They need you.

16:23.608 --> 16:24.818
LEO:
All right, everyone.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.069
Please sit down.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.279
Where are you, Hanna?

16:28.196 --> 16:31.074
-Hey, calm down.
-This is all lies!

16:28.321 --> 16:29.656
They know you're alive.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.325
Okay.

16:31.116 --> 16:35.537
-My mother and father are dead.
-I know.

16:32.367 --> 16:36.162
So, the aim
of these sessions, guys,

16:36.204 --> 16:38.373
is to introduce you
to the dangers

16:36.955 --> 16:39.457
My father's gone.
He's not coming back.

16:38.415 --> 16:41.209
in the world outside,

16:41.251 --> 16:44.879
dangers you will be fighting
on behalf of our government

16:42.711 --> 16:45.505
He wasn't your father

16:44.921 --> 16:47.465
and people everywhere.

16:45.547 --> 16:48.758
any more than this one.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.300
Now, to be able to fight
these dangers,

16:49.342 --> 16:52.053
you'll need all the combat
and operational skills

16:51.720 --> 16:52.971
My mother's dead, too.

16:52.095 --> 16:53.263
you've been developing,

16:53.054 --> 16:57.267
She's not coming back
and I know that.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.515
but you'll also need
to understand the world

16:55.557 --> 16:57.892
and how it's come
to be this way.

16:57.308 --> 16:59.477
-What they offer us here...
-It's not real.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.271
But it could be.

17:02.981 --> 17:06.693
There's no life for us out there
without them, and you know that.

17:06.735 --> 17:09.446
That's why you came here.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.701
-I came here to find you.
-And you found me.

17:14.743 --> 17:15.910
But you're not you anymore.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.620
:
...will assemble

17:17.662 --> 17:19.539
at the outdoor training ground
for military maneuvers.

17:19.581 --> 17:22.500
I haven't changed.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.878
I just changed my name
and my clothes.

17:24.919 --> 17:28.006
Training Group A to the outdoor
training ground immediately.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.008
-You lied to me.
-I had to.

17:30.008 --> 17:32.552
-You chose to.
-Hanna...

17:38.475 --> 17:40.727
McCOY:
Riley.

17:40.769 --> 17:42.103
Baker-Smith.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.688
Young.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.774
Marks.

17:45.815 --> 17:50.487
Allen. Phillips.

17:50.445 --> 17:54.532
of a child.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.239
Jones. Wolff.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.658
:
We've just located her.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.620
Taylor.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.121
Moneo.

18:00.163 --> 18:01.706
Ainslee.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.959
-Where is Mia?
-Rodriguez...

18:05.001 --> 18:06.252
Fuck it, we don't need her.

18:06.294 --> 18:09.798
Harper. Crossman.

18:11.049 --> 18:14.511
Williams. Carter.

18:17.180 --> 18:20.642
You have been assigned teams.
Four teams of four.

18:20.683 --> 18:23.937
The objective of the mission
is to retrieve the flag

18:23.978 --> 18:25.313
from the burned-out vehicle.

18:25.355 --> 18:28.942
Work together.
Collaborate.

18:28.983 --> 18:33.363
Whoever gets the flag wins.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.033
Change of scenery?

18:35.865 --> 18:38.284
First time on maneuvers?

18:36.324 --> 18:38.451
Terri.

18:37.075 --> 18:39.452
Something like that.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.286
Pull to reload, hold to fire.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.119
My name's Leo Garner.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.538
Hello.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.373
Welcome to the Meadows.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.791
I know.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.375
Thank you.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.377
You've used one of these before?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.961
How's it going with Sandy?

18:47.418 --> 18:49.671
I've used a real one.

18:48.002 --> 18:50.839
Oh, you know.

18:49.712 --> 18:53.883
Red Team, move!

18:50.463 --> 18:52.966
You see something we missed?

18:50.880 --> 18:52.632
Slowly but surely.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.008
Hmm.

18:53.007 --> 18:54.968
If they're in the forest,
you'll never find them.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.553
It's thousands of miles,

18:55.093 --> 18:56.803
Where the hell is she going?

18:55.760 --> 18:56.970
Let me guess.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.681
and Hanna knows that terrain
better than anyone.

18:56.845 --> 18:57.971
We haven't been sent out yet.

18:57.011 --> 18:59.764
You're struggling.

18:58.012 --> 18:59.514
Blue Team, move!

18:59.722 --> 19:00.723
You found her last time.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.891
I made a mistake.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.183
Last time, she made a mistake

19:01.933 --> 19:03.309
I tried to make her feel
as though

19:02.225 --> 19:03.935
because she was frustrated
with her life.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.728
I was like her somehow.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.270
She won't do that again.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.773
Maybe you don't want us
to find her.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.272
But she's too smart for that.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.731
Mm-hmm.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.401
Sad thing is I don't think
she wants help.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.150
What exactly do you mean
by that?

19:11.442 --> 19:14.404
I think she wants
to destroy herself.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.153
Who took this photograph?

19:14.195 --> 19:16.406
MARISSA:
I did.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.155
Why?

19:16.197 --> 19:17.615
She's clinging on to something.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.366
Holiday snaps.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.033
Some...

19:18.408 --> 19:19.951
Not like you.

19:19.075 --> 19:22.036
pain she refuses to get rid of.

19:19.993 --> 19:23.121
I needed to prove to Sawyer
I had Hanna in my care.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.581
Something out there?

19:23.162 --> 19:25.707
Did you become attached to her?

19:24.622 --> 19:27.000
Her mother, I think.

19:25.748 --> 19:26.875
No, I did not.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.168
Perfectly natural
to have an affinity for her,

19:27.041 --> 19:29.127
But they never met.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.545
Doesn't matter.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.671
given the past,
no child of your own.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.338
She knows about her.

19:31.713 --> 19:34.257
I don't feel anything, John.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.883
And now, she can't let it go.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.968
I'll let you know when I do.

19:34.632 --> 19:38.219
I'll cover.
One, two--

19:34.924 --> 19:37.844
Let what go, exactly?

19:38.261 --> 19:40.221
-Clem!
-Where's Mia?

19:38.761 --> 19:40.346
I'd like to go.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.140
Screw her, she left us.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.515
You can't hold me here
against my will.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.057
She needs to know

19:42.140 --> 19:43.558
Clemency!

19:42.557 --> 19:44.267
You know that as well as I.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.101
if her mother ever loved her.

19:44.309 --> 19:45.685
Okay.

19:45.727 --> 19:47.562
Let me ask you something first.

19:47.604 --> 19:50.148
Are you lying to me?

19:50.189 --> 19:52.150
Did you really shoot Erik Heller

19:52.191 --> 19:56.571
or did you go to Utrax to kill
Sawyer and save Hanna's life?

19:53.484 --> 19:55.361
What's going on out there?!

19:56.613 --> 19:57.989
I think I know the answer.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.574
So, here's the deal:

19:59.616 --> 20:02.744
I stay quiet about what you did
and I leave Hanna alone,

20:01.367 --> 20:03.077
JULES:
Why are you reading that?

20:02.785 --> 20:06.289
but you give me Trainee 249.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.454
HELEN:
You said it was good.

20:04.495 --> 20:05.914
JULES:
Fuck that.

20:05.955 --> 20:09.918
Such a shitty phallocentric
piece of shit.

20:09.834 --> 20:13.671
on a knife's edge

20:09.959 --> 20:12.754
Last week you said you liked it.

20:12.629 --> 20:15.006
How did your mother die?

20:12.795 --> 20:14.088
"Last week"?

20:13.713 --> 20:15.673
Wow.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.340
You better keep up, girl.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.967
I told you.
I don't want to talk about it.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.592
Things move fast around here.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.886
Do you guys believe in God?

20:19.010 --> 20:20.595
LEO:
This is a whole new level.

20:19.928 --> 20:22.764
God is a human construct.

20:21.429 --> 20:23.890
Was she killed by them?

20:22.805 --> 20:24.182
What does that mean?

20:24.223 --> 20:25.600
It means he's made up.

20:25.642 --> 20:28.019
How do you know God is a man?

20:28.061 --> 20:31.189
Because he was invented by men.

20:28.186 --> 20:30.647
Do you miss her?

20:30.688 --> 20:32.065
I never knew her.

20:30.772 --> 20:34.400
What fucking chance did we have?
She left us totally exposed.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.982
Is this about Aaron?

20:32.106 --> 20:35.693
How can you miss someone
you've never met?

20:33.024 --> 20:34.525
No, it's not about Aaron.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.902
Then what do you have
against men?

20:35.944 --> 20:37.195
Nothing.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.322
I just prefer women.

20:39.364 --> 20:41.783
Since when?

20:41.824 --> 20:43.034
Since always.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.203
You're attracted to women?

20:44.661 --> 20:47.038
-Hello. How are you today?
-I'm well, thank you.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.830
That's the general idea, Helen.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.957
That's five dollars.
With rice or baked potato?

20:47.872 --> 20:49.874
Hmm.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.918
Are you attracted to me?

20:51.960 --> 20:54.128
Don't worry, you're not my type.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.255
-Hmm.
-What about me?

20:55.755 --> 20:57.256
TRAINEE 242:
She looks so weird,

20:57.298 --> 20:59.759
still in that old uniform.

20:58.925 --> 21:02.512
I see you more like a sister.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.928
Not everyone's done it.

21:02.553 --> 21:04.639
I'm the same.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.556
I'm glad you did.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.433
And anyway,
you've got your lover.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.059
It makes me feel better.

21:07.475 --> 21:10.144
I can't beat him.

21:11.479 --> 21:13.690
What's the name they gave you?

21:13.731 --> 21:15.108
Sandy.

21:15.149 --> 21:17.276
I'm Jules.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.735
Shh.

21:17.318 --> 21:19.445
Hi, Jules.

21:19.487 --> 21:20.822
Hi, Sandy.

21:20.780 --> 21:21.990
The truck, I found it.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.283
Where are you from, apparently?

21:24.325 --> 21:26.035
Uh, I'm from Ohio.

21:26.077 --> 21:27.203
A small town.

21:27.245 --> 21:29.288
Bentleyville.

21:29.330 --> 21:32.041
What's that like?

21:29.872 --> 21:31.290
HANNA:
Wait!

21:32.083 --> 21:33.960
Beautiful.

21:34.002 --> 21:36.796
There's lots of forest
and rivers.

21:36.838 --> 21:39.048
And you go fishing
for pike and bass,

21:37.880 --> 21:39.465
MARISSA:
Where are you, Hanna?

21:39.090 --> 21:41.300
except in the summer,
when it runs dry.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.926
They know you're alive.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.052
I'm from Oregon.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.470
By the ocean.

21:44.512 --> 21:45.972
I surf.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.473
I have a boyfriend called Aaron.

21:47.515 --> 21:48.808
He's hot.

21:48.850 --> 21:51.102
Why is he hot?

21:51.144 --> 21:54.689
No, it means, like,
he's really handsome.

21:54.731 --> 21:57.608
Oh.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.402
Can I see him?

21:58.568 --> 22:00.153
-Where the hell have you been?

21:59.444 --> 22:01.320
It's in here.

22:00.194 --> 22:01.821
HANNA:
I'm following him.

22:01.863 --> 22:03.823
He's eating in a diner.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.949
SANDY:
He looks nice.

22:03.197 --> 22:04.907
Down!

22:03.865 --> 22:05.742
Send me the address now.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.743
-Shit.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.451
He is.

22:06.492 --> 22:09.037
And I have a brother,
but I don't like him.

22:09.078 --> 22:11.205
It says he was mean to me
when I was young.

22:11.247 --> 22:12.790
Put beetles in my shoes.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.209
What a dumbass.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.628
Yeah.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.131
He is a dumbass.

22:20.173 --> 22:23.134
I have a brother and a sister,
too, but she's sick.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.053
It takes up a lot
of the family's attention.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.888
What's wrong with her?

22:26.929 --> 22:29.307
Muscular disease.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.391
It may be psychological.

22:30.433 --> 22:31.768
We don't know for sure.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.770
That must be annoying.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.147
No.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.899
I love her.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.567
MARISSA:
I need to talk
to the other trainees.

22:39.609 --> 22:41.235
The ones who were there.

22:49.911 --> 22:52.538
pididdle-a-diddle

22:52.580 --> 22:55.208
pididdle, oh, baby

22:54.123 --> 22:55.833
CARMICHAEL:
Hi, Sandy.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.251
That's your name, isn't it?

22:57.293 --> 23:00.296
-Yes.
-Hi. Uh, I know

23:00.338 --> 23:02.715
we already spoke to you about
this at Wilberforce Air Base,

23:01.672 --> 23:03.633
Hi.

23:02.757 --> 23:05.051
but I wanted to go through
one more time what happened,

23:03.674 --> 23:06.010
What was that noise earlier?

23:05.093 --> 23:06.636
with Agent Hawkins here.

23:06.052 --> 23:09.097
Hey, do you know
what's happening to me?

23:06.677 --> 23:09.305
About Trainee 249.

23:09.138 --> 23:11.224
Am I leaving?

23:09.347 --> 23:12.016
I've told you everything I know.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.435
Sandy, my name's Joan.

23:14.477 --> 23:17.855
I'm really worried
about Trainee 249.

23:14.769 --> 23:16.729
-Right in front of us.
-That's crazy.

23:15.478 --> 23:18.773
there came a 'rod

23:16.771 --> 23:18.106
Oh, fuck, man.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.690
She's missing the opportunity
to experience

23:18.147 --> 23:19.690
I could have killed you
for leaving us,

23:18.815 --> 23:21.859
and one lamp on...

23:19.732 --> 23:21.109
what you're experiencing,

23:19.732 --> 23:20.650
but you kicked ass.

23:20.691 --> 23:22.360
That was amazing.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.777
gaining a new life.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.027
Mademoiselle?

23:22.401 --> 23:25.404
It was so cool, Mia.
Really.

23:22.819 --> 23:26.197
I'd like to bring her back
and offer her that chance.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.445
Ah, merci.

23:26.239 --> 23:29.367
But for that,
I need your help, 'kay?

23:28.199 --> 23:30.952
To the winner, the spoils.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.868
So, you were in the room
next to her.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.037
Is that right?
The day she left.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.289
She talked to me
through the wall.

23:35.331 --> 23:36.374
What'd she say?

23:35.456 --> 23:38.835
What am I supposed
to do with this?

23:36.415 --> 23:37.959
She said someone was coming.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.627
Then what?

23:39.669 --> 23:42.255
I heard her talk to this girl
through the door.

23:41.337 --> 23:42.296
Whatever you want.

23:42.296 --> 23:44.423
The girl opened the doors
somehow.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.966
You can put it in your room.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.467
And then 249 went out.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.468
It's yours, Mia.
You earned it.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.719
She said we were free.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.764
I didn't believe her.

23:49.011 --> 23:50.388
I don't want it.

23:50.388 --> 23:51.722
But, Mia...

23:51.764 --> 23:52.974
I don't want it.

23:53.015 --> 23:54.308
You like it so much,
you have it.

23:53.975 --> 23:55.685
And so then what happened?

23:54.350 --> 23:56.811
What the fuck?

23:55.726 --> 23:57.436
Did she meet that girl alone?

23:56.853 --> 23:58.104
Leave it.

23:57.478 --> 23:59.480
I don't know.

23:58.146 --> 23:59.897
What was all that about?

23:59.522 --> 24:01.649
There's no reason to lie, Sandy.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.024
We won.  She won.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.067
Not to me.

24:03.109 --> 24:06.654
Did you go to the door and look?

24:10.449 --> 24:12.743
What happened
when you went to the door?

24:12.785 --> 24:13.744
What did you see?

24:13.786 --> 24:16.164
She showed her something.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.790
On the screen.

24:17.832 --> 24:18.958
What was it?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.710
I don't know.

24:20.751 --> 24:22.712
Yes, you do.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.929
It was something from her past.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.849
Her real past.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.893
What did she show her?

24:38.895 --> 24:41.647
She showed her
who her mother was, didn't she?

24:41.689 --> 24:43.399
SANDY:
I didn't tell

24:43.441 --> 24:45.151
any of the other trainees,
honestly.

24:45.193 --> 24:46.903
Oh, that's okay.
You're not in trouble.

24:46.944 --> 24:49.071
-I don't want
to leave the program.
-CARMICHAEL: It's okay.

24:49.113 --> 24:50.531
You did everything
we could have asked.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.742
Okay? Thanks. You can go now.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.794
ERIK:
Come on.

25:03.085 --> 25:06.756
CARMICHAEL:
Yeah, we're holding Wiegler
here in isolation.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.296
Faster.

25:05.338 --> 25:06.797
Don't give up.

25:06.797 --> 25:09.342
-Let me know your decision.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.469
Come in.

25:13.471 --> 25:14.805
You wanted to see me?

25:14.847 --> 25:18.100
Uh, yes, sir.
It's about Mia.

25:18.142 --> 25:19.602
What about her?

25:25.233 --> 25:27.443
I think she's having trouble

25:27.485 --> 25:31.656
accepting her identity
at a fundamental level.

25:31.697 --> 25:34.325
She's clearly attracted
to what we're offering,

25:33.366 --> 25:35.076
You okay?

25:34.367 --> 25:38.454
but there is a resistance
that she can't overcome.

25:38.496 --> 25:41.040
Her father, Erik Heller.

25:39.997 --> 25:42.959
Are we going to stay here
forever?

25:41.082 --> 25:42.375
Erik Heller was not her father.

25:42.416 --> 25:43.376
Not biologically.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.544
It's safe here.
Don't you want to be safe?

25:43.417 --> 25:46.170
But they had a strong bond.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.754
Sonia. Sorry.

25:45.586 --> 25:46.671
-Course I do.
-Maybe you don't.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.256
It's not easy to replace that.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.673
Maybe you want
to go back to that facility.

25:46.796 --> 25:48.422
I didn't mean to freak you out.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.591
You achieved strong bonds
with the other trainees.

25:48.464 --> 25:50.466
Carmichael called.
He asked me to bring you this.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.592
-That facility
doesn't exist anymore.
-Then another facility.

25:50.633 --> 25:53.719
With the others, we're not
trying to replace anything.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.344
Is that what you want?

25:53.761 --> 25:56.264
We are filling a gap.

25:54.387 --> 25:55.888
No, of course not.

25:55.930 --> 25:58.641
Where they put drugs under
your skin to keep you sleepy.

25:56.305 --> 25:58.933
With Mia, it's more difficult.

25:58.683 --> 26:00.518
The same room every day.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.270
The same food,
the same exercises.

26:01.435 --> 26:05.147
I think we need to acknowledge
what's already there

26:02.311 --> 26:04.563
-No air, no going outside.
-All right, I get it.

26:04.605 --> 26:06.482
No, you don't get it.
That thing in the sky,

26:05.189 --> 26:07.149
in order to move on from it.

26:06.524 --> 26:08.025
it wasn't after me,
it was after you.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.653
I'm protecting you.

26:10.403 --> 26:13.281
Why do you never listen to me?!

26:10.695 --> 26:11.946
In the whole wide world,

26:11.988 --> 26:14.240
this is the only place
we are safe.

26:13.322 --> 26:15.783
Now your father's gone
and called the police.

26:15.825 --> 26:16.867
What do you think about that?

26:18.077 --> 26:19.287
Hey!

26:19.328 --> 26:20.371
I asked you a question!

26:20.413 --> 26:22.164
LEO:
So there are 30 trainees.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.332
Fuck you.

26:22.206 --> 26:24.875
They'll be writing e-mails
and communicating online

26:23.374 --> 26:24.625
You get in this car.

26:24.667 --> 26:27.253
You get in this fucking car!
Get in.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.044
to a whole host of relatives
and friends

26:26.419 --> 26:30.798
want to see us alone

26:27.086 --> 26:31.007
as we build the backstory
for them and their families.

26:30.840 --> 26:34.760
want to see us apart

26:31.048 --> 26:33.551
Now, these stories need to
stack up for universities.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.928
Friends, lovers, uh,
anyone they might meet

26:34.802 --> 26:38.014
want to see us alone...

26:35.970 --> 26:37.138
and show them to.

26:36.637 --> 26:39.265
He'll pick up
his fucking car later.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.348
You send mails, posts,

26:38.055 --> 26:40.224
That'll teach you to be a hero.

26:39.390 --> 26:41.309
reply to their
social media shout-outs.

26:40.266 --> 26:44.562
want to see us apart

26:41.350 --> 26:43.728
You chat with them
on all the online platforms.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.147
You can make requests for
visual support material

26:45.396 --> 26:46.856
I told you
to stay outside the building.

26:46.188 --> 26:47.773
through the Gemini data archive,

26:46.897 --> 26:48.274
What were you thinking?

26:47.398 --> 26:49.317
Can't sleep?

26:47.815 --> 26:49.734
which you can access
through your computer.

26:48.316 --> 26:50.526
If I'd waited,
we would have lost him.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.152
Any questions?

26:50.568 --> 26:52.111
We have to follow the truck.

26:51.193 --> 26:54.864
Okay, so you said
there are 30 different trainees.

26:51.986 --> 26:54.947
You want help with that?

26:52.153 --> 26:54.280
It's going to the Meadows.

26:54.905 --> 26:57.074
-Yeah.
-Each with maybe ten

26:54.989 --> 26:56.991
Okay.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.368
or-or 20 major correspondents

26:59.410 --> 27:02.371
and a hundred occasional
social media contacts.

27:02.413 --> 27:04.415
And they'll show them all
to each other,

27:04.457 --> 27:06.000
so each one has to be different.

27:05.041 --> 27:07.543
This is from your mother.

27:07.543 --> 27:08.919
It's fun, huh?

27:08.544 --> 27:10.880
She wrote you a letter.

27:09.128 --> 27:11.714
I'm glad you're here.

27:11.714 --> 27:13.716
Food's available 24 hours a day.

27:11.756 --> 27:13.841
It wasn't my choice.

27:11.881 --> 27:14.091
That's impossible. When?

27:13.758 --> 27:15.468
Entertainment consoles, TV,
it's all yours.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.344
When you were born.

27:15.509 --> 27:16.927
But no contact
with the trainees,

27:16.177 --> 27:18.596
I know.

27:16.385 --> 27:19.513
We were supposed to give it to
you before your first mission.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.721
and from now on,
no phone calls home.

27:18.596 --> 27:22.600
But I also know if you wanted
to leave, you'd find a way.

27:18.763 --> 27:21.223
Oh, I have a family who think
I'm working for an oil company.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.265
But, because it's you,

27:21.265 --> 27:22.641
They'll expect to hear from me.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.809
we thought we'd bend the rules.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.894
I guess you were told
this was a Red Mark operation.

27:24.935 --> 27:27.521
Well, it is.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.647
Go ahead.

27:30.191 --> 27:32.651
When you were fighting
out there today,

27:30.274 --> 27:32.735
Have you read it?

27:32.693 --> 27:35.529
you looked at home.

27:32.777 --> 27:35.988
I didn't feel
it was any of my business.

27:35.571 --> 27:38.157
You looked like you, you know?

27:38.199 --> 27:41.243
It wasn't a real forest.
It was just trees.

27:41.285 --> 27:44.622
You could see the fence
all around us.

27:42.411 --> 27:45.498
You can take your time.

27:46.665 --> 27:50.878
But it feels real,
when you're in it, doesn't it?

27:56.425 --> 27:59.011
What is it?

28:08.729 --> 28:13.234
I just got a message
from my mom.

28:13.275 --> 28:14.902
My sister's at the hospital.

28:16.487 --> 28:17.738
They're operating now.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.366
I'm sorry.

28:19.782 --> 28:22.076
Is she in danger?

28:20.408 --> 28:23.536
You saved me,
and I'm not grateful.

28:23.577 --> 28:25.871
It's okay.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.288
She'll be okay.

28:26.330 --> 28:29.083
She's strong, right?

28:30.459 --> 28:33.295
I just don't want to
be alone anymore.

28:32.086 --> 28:35.214
:
Thank you.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.547
Hey, it's okay.

28:34.588 --> 28:37.007
We'll wait with you.

28:35.256 --> 28:37.883
I know you miss her.

28:35.423 --> 28:39.510
We're not alone.
We have each other.

28:37.925 --> 28:40.719
-You've never even met her.
-

28:40.761 --> 28:43.514
And that hurts inside.

28:47.143 --> 28:50.729
If she was here now,
what would you say?

28:49.770 --> 28:51.439
CARMICHAEL:
You sure about this?

28:51.730 --> 28:54.733
Go on. Try.

28:54.024 --> 28:56.235
I think so.

28:55.985 --> 28:58.362
Why didn't you want me?

28:56.277 --> 28:59.321
Okay. Do it now.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.114
-I know.

29:00.156 --> 29:03.659
I'm here. I'm here.
I'm here.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.620
Let it go.

29:06.704 --> 29:08.581
MARISSA:
Now Clara knows,

29:08.622 --> 29:10.541
she'll go looking
for her mother.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.001
She won't be able to resist it.

29:12.042 --> 29:14.003
And that's how you'll get her.

29:13.043 --> 29:14.837
-You were right.
-

29:14.044 --> 29:15.754
CARMICHAEL:
She's Egyptian.

29:14.879 --> 29:17.590
You were right.

29:15.796 --> 29:17.006
Came to Romania
as an illegal immigrant.

29:17.047 --> 29:20.217
Met a Nigerian guy.
She got pregnant by accident.

29:17.631 --> 29:20.092
I'm nothing like you.

29:20.134 --> 29:23.929
I can't even begin to imagine
how all this feels.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.178
She decided to give up the baby.

29:22.219 --> 29:25.181
After she gave her baby
to Utrax, she disappeared.

29:23.971 --> 29:28.392
But there are 30 girls
around here who do.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.640
There's no record
of where she went.

29:26.682 --> 29:27.975
Nothing online.

29:28.017 --> 29:30.478
Samira Mahan may not even
be her real name.

29:28.434 --> 29:32.813
And who will never,
ever abandon you.

29:30.519 --> 29:33.105
So if Clara does search
for her mother,

29:33.147 --> 29:34.773
there's nothing for her to find.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.275
Okay?

29:34.815 --> 29:39.111
Well, then I guess you better
make something up, John,

29:38.027 --> 29:39.862
Do you want me to read it?

29:39.153 --> 29:41.655
because she will go looking.

29:40.446 --> 29:43.282
Will they forgive me?

29:41.697 --> 29:44.116
Stand by! Engage!

29:44.158 --> 29:45.493
Whoa!

29:44.783 --> 29:47.828
We always wanted you here.

29:45.534 --> 29:48.204
Engage!

29:47.870 --> 29:50.789
And we still do.

29:48.245 --> 29:51.499
Whoa! Engage!

29:51.540 --> 29:52.583
Whoa!

29:55.169 --> 29:58.506
She said the doctors
really tried.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.549
They tried their best.

29:59.173 --> 30:01.550
TERRI:
"Hi, Sandy.
Just posting to see

30:01.592 --> 30:03.594
"how you are finishing
high school.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.721
"It's sunny here, and we took
Jodie out for a walk.

30:05.763 --> 30:09.099
"She took a few steps herself,
isn't that cool?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.976
"I'll get a photo for you soon.

30:11.018 --> 30:15.105
Write when you can. Mom."

30:12.937 --> 30:16.524
JULES:
I'm so sorry, Sandy.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.899
-

30:15.481 --> 30:17.858
through the walls

30:16.941 --> 30:18.442
SANDY:
"Hi, Mom.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.237
"I'm having a great time
at the private school.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.028
MARISSA:
What is it about Clara?

30:21.070 --> 30:23.197
It's not just guilt, is it?

30:21.278 --> 30:23.280
"I'm glad I decided to move
to New York,

30:21.570 --> 30:23.822
I should go.

30:23.239 --> 30:24.949
the walls...

30:23.322 --> 30:25.157
"even though I miss you all.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.534
Why do you care so much?

30:25.199 --> 30:27.660
"I needed the space from Jodie
to focus on my studies

30:26.700 --> 30:29.245
SANDY:
I know you don't believe
it's real.

30:27.701 --> 30:30.329
"so I can get into
a good college.

30:28.577 --> 30:30.037
When we were in the forest,

30:30.079 --> 30:33.249
I felt something
I'd never felt before.

30:30.371 --> 30:32.790
"Did I tell you I met a friend?

30:31.288 --> 30:34.667
But it's real to me.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.626
"She's really nice.
Her name is Jules.

30:33.290 --> 30:36.085
We are the same.

30:34.708 --> 30:38.420
She's real to me.

30:35.668 --> 30:39.296
"I'll send you a photo of her.
She has really cool hair.

30:36.126 --> 30:38.837
But you barely know each other.

30:38.462 --> 30:43.342
As real as anyone is to anyone.

30:38.879 --> 30:41.173
I don't need to.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.340
"Don't worry, I won't copy her.

30:41.382 --> 30:45.177
"The weather is good this fall.
Very sunny.

30:43.384 --> 30:46.220
And now she's gone.

30:45.219 --> 30:47.346
"And we're playing
a lot of sports,

30:47.388 --> 30:49.348
"and I'm looking forward
to my music lessons.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.306
Can I change it?

30:49.390 --> 30:52.726
"Sometimes, of course,
I get lonely.

30:50.683 --> 30:52.059
Oh.

30:52.101 --> 30:54.478
You don't like it?

30:52.768 --> 30:55.980
"I miss you and Dad,
and I miss Jodie.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.022
Do you?

30:56.021 --> 30:59.858
"But not Brad, and you can
tell him that.

30:58.399 --> 31:00.818
MARISSA:
Maybe it's not meant for you.

30:59.900 --> 31:01.443
"And I miss Montana, of course.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.611
Who is it meant for?

31:01.485 --> 31:03.571
"Give him a stroke for me.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.239
"Tell him I'll walk him
when I return,

31:03.904 --> 31:05.698
Older people.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.408
"after the semester ends.

31:05.739 --> 31:06.907
Like you.

31:06.949 --> 31:08.617
Yeah, like me.

31:07.449 --> 31:09.910
Hugs and kisses. Sandy."

31:08.659 --> 31:10.369
and I'm grown...

31:10.411 --> 31:13.289
I think you look good
for your age.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.791
Depends on how old
you think I am.

31:15.833 --> 31:18.377
Old enough
to look good for your age.

31:18.419 --> 31:21.213
Very good.

31:21.255 --> 31:23.841
a man and let his shit blow

31:22.339 --> 31:24.341
HANNA:
Come with me.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.801
choke on all of this smoke

31:25.843 --> 31:27.595
but nine times out of ten.

31:26.343 --> 31:27.761
Where?

31:27.803 --> 31:30.598
Just come.

31:34.602 --> 31:37.062
GUARD:
We've got an alarm tripped
in the accommodation block.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.398
Four trainees are out
before morning call.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.442
Shall I round them up?

31:41.483 --> 31:42.860
No. Leave them.

31:42.484 --> 31:44.111
LEO:
She's watching 'em run.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.278
Copy that.

31:44.153 --> 31:46.989
Where is she?

31:44.695 --> 31:46.989
ERIK:
Hanna?

31:48.991 --> 31:52.453
LEO:
She's been there
nearly half an hour.

31:52.494 --> 31:54.913
You know what that means?

31:56.206 --> 31:57.583
She's jealous.

31:57.625 --> 32:01.211
She wants to get back with them.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.713
So,

32:02.755 --> 32:05.341
now it's over to me.

32:10.471 --> 32:11.680
Come in.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.517
Oh. Sorry.

32:15.559 --> 32:16.518
It's okay.

32:15.809 --> 32:18.771
You want to...

32:16.560 --> 32:18.562
You sure?

32:18.604 --> 32:20.314
How's it going?

32:18.812 --> 32:20.898
say something?

32:20.356 --> 32:21.649
Okay, you know.

32:22.358 --> 32:24.568
What should I say?

32:23.275 --> 32:24.818
I'm so impressed,

32:24.860 --> 32:27.696
seeing you embrace
your parents' values.

32:25.903 --> 32:27.946
ERIK:
Hanna!

32:26.111 --> 32:31.200
Say who she was
and what she meant to you.

32:29.657 --> 32:31.033
How's Clara?

32:30.157 --> 32:32.159
Clara?

32:31.075 --> 32:32.785
Uh...

32:32.826 --> 32:35.829
we're deciding
what to do with her right now.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.331
Before you do,

32:36.121 --> 32:39.416
She was so beautiful.

32:37.373 --> 32:38.624
can I see her?

32:38.874 --> 32:41.043
How did you get lost?

32:39.458 --> 32:44.672
She was funny
and she was so sweet.

32:39.667 --> 32:40.709
Oh.

32:40.751 --> 32:42.211
I see.

32:41.085 --> 32:44.672
I was with my mother.
I went the wrong way.

32:42.252 --> 32:44.296
I didn't think you'd want to.

32:44.338 --> 32:47.174
No, I'd like to see her.

32:44.713 --> 32:47.341
You don't have a phone?

32:46.882 --> 32:49.718
She didn't deserve
the shit she had,

32:49.176 --> 32:51.637
Okay.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.595
DAUGHTER:
Are you American?

32:49.760 --> 32:52.638
but she never moaned.

32:51.679 --> 32:54.014
Let me see what I can do.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.890
She was the bravest person
I ever met.

32:53.222 --> 32:55.599
Are you on holiday?

32:55.641 --> 32:57.685
Where are you staying?

32:56.809 --> 32:58.811
And now she's gone.

32:56.892 --> 32:59.269
-

32:57.726 --> 32:59.895
My mother's name is
Samira Mahan.

32:59.937 --> 33:01.939
I need to find her.

33:09.571 --> 33:11.782
With an "A."

33:15.703 --> 33:17.705
Is this her?

33:24.169 --> 33:25.879
We're not going in guns blazing.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.214
I hope you know that.

33:27.256 --> 33:30.217
That's not my style.

33:30.259 --> 33:32.344
We find her,
we get her out, we leave.

33:39.101 --> 33:41.854
What is Canada like?

33:43.021 --> 33:45.816
It's really beautiful.

33:45.858 --> 33:47.568
There's lots of mountains,

33:47.192 --> 33:50.237
Thanks for what you did.

33:47.609 --> 33:49.069
forests.

33:49.111 --> 33:50.487
You'll love it.

33:50.279 --> 33:52.239
I'll check on her later.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.030
Both of you.

33:54.241 --> 33:56.243
Get some sleep.

33:55.159 --> 33:57.327
Will you come visit us?

33:58.579 --> 34:01.248
MOTHER:
She's staying in a hotel
near Bucharest.

33:59.788 --> 34:01.165
I would like that,

34:01.206 --> 34:04.960
but I don't think
it's a... good idea.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.586
I can take you there,
if you like.

34:06.128 --> 34:09.131
Why are you helping then?

34:10.257 --> 34:13.093
I don't know.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.219
Good night.

34:15.637 --> 34:17.431
Can I see Clara's passport?

34:17.473 --> 34:18.932
Yeah.

34:18.766 --> 34:21.226
-All good?
-Yeah.

34:18.974 --> 34:20.809
Oh.

34:20.851 --> 34:23.061
I'm sorry.

34:21.268 --> 34:23.479
Get some sleep. I'll take over.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.606
There.

34:25.647 --> 34:27.983
There you go.

34:34.865 --> 34:37.659
Carmichael.

34:37.701 --> 34:40.913
I understand. We'll do that now.

34:45.292 --> 34:47.669
Your transport's here.

34:47.711 --> 34:49.505
Where to?

34:47.961 --> 34:49.421
It's my ex.

34:49.463 --> 34:52.049
Sorry. I won't be long.

34:49.546 --> 34:52.132
Just wanted to show you that
before you go.

34:52.174 --> 34:54.635
To prove to you
that the fight's over.

34:57.054 --> 34:58.889
Have you been writing home?

34:57.679 --> 34:59.723
She'll never belong here.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.057
Hi.

34:58.931 --> 35:00.557
A little bit. You?

34:59.765 --> 35:01.725
She already does.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.475
Hanna's alive.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.935
Yeah, a lot.
To my mom, especially.

35:01.517 --> 35:03.143
She killed one of my people.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.852
You're the one who signed
the paper, remember?

35:02.976 --> 35:04.561
She's lonely without me.

35:03.894 --> 35:06.271
Or is it too long ago?

35:04.603 --> 35:07.439
My dad's in Iraq again,
and my sister's not well.

35:07.731 --> 35:09.483
Why not just kill me, John?

35:09.483 --> 35:11.401
-What?
-Nothing.

35:09.525 --> 35:11.485
Believe me, I would have.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.947
Just... you know
it's not real, right?

35:11.527 --> 35:13.153
With pleasure.

35:11.568 --> 35:13.779
MARISSA:
Where is she?

35:13.195 --> 35:15.489
But the powers that be...

35:13.821 --> 35:15.447
Is she in Paris?
Is that why you're calling me?

35:14.988 --> 35:16.949
Why do you say that?

35:15.489 --> 35:17.449
Last night,
she was in Charleroi, Belgium.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.992
Because it's not.

35:17.491 --> 35:19.076
And you sent Sonia to find her.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.453
Well, maybe it can be.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.245
Come on, John.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.247
She took a day off
without any notice.

35:21.495 --> 35:23.455
What do you mean?

35:21.495 --> 35:22.871
Keep it.

35:22.913 --> 35:25.415
Consider it my parting gift.

35:23.288 --> 35:24.665
It's not exactly subtle.

35:23.497 --> 35:25.040
Well, if they want us
to live in the world,

35:24.706 --> 35:27.251
I'm gonna send you a photograph.

35:25.082 --> 35:27.334
then my family can't
just be writing letters, right?

35:27.376 --> 35:30.170
At some point,
I have to talk to them.

35:30.212 --> 35:32.297
Maybe meet 'em.

35:32.339 --> 35:33.924
How can you meet them?

35:33.966 --> 35:35.926
They have faces.

35:40.597 --> 35:44.142
You don't... get it, do you?

35:44.184 --> 35:47.354
They're just a story
to tell people.

35:47.396 --> 35:49.147
Nothing more.

35:49.189 --> 35:50.607
Listen, you do what
you want, okay.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.109
You don't have to write
to anyone.

35:50.983 --> 35:52.568
CARMICHAEL:
I think it was Hanna.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.360
That's not what I meant.

35:52.609 --> 35:54.528
I think she's trying
to find the Meadows.

35:53.402 --> 35:55.195
-Just leave me alone.
-Sandy...

35:55.571 --> 35:56.780
MARISSA:
Okay.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.365
What do you need from me?

35:58.407 --> 36:01.660
I need you to find her.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.083
You want me to message her,
tell her you're coming?

36:08.125 --> 36:09.376
Yes, please.

36:09.418 --> 36:10.878
What should I say?

36:12.838 --> 36:14.423
Say her daughter wants
to see her.

36:17.134 --> 36:18.677
CARMICHAEL:
You were right.

36:18.719 --> 36:20.095
-She made contact.
-Where?

36:20.137 --> 36:22.222
In a forest south of
a village called Ulitze.

36:22.264 --> 36:25.601
She's heading to Bucharest now
with a Romanian family.

36:25.642 --> 36:27.603
Thinks her mother's
in the hotel.

36:27.644 --> 36:29.229
We're arranging the RV.

36:29.271 --> 36:31.231
-I need you there.
-MAN: Let's go.

36:31.273 --> 36:32.941
-MAN 2: Locked and loaded, sir.
-And what about Hanna?

36:32.983 --> 36:35.193
We're leaving Hanna alone,
just like you asked.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.614
CARMICHAEL:
This is Carmichael.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.825
Who is this?

37:14.650 --> 37:16.610
Hello?

37:16.652 --> 37:19.988
Can you hear me?

37:20.030 --> 37:21.990
Hey. I'm leaving.

37:22.032 --> 37:23.992
I need something to eat
before I go.

37:24.034 --> 37:26.036
GUARD:
No meals outside of hours.

37:26.078 --> 37:28.747
What about some water?

37:28.789 --> 37:32.584
That's allowed, right?

37:30.916 --> 37:32.876
SOLDIER:
Bravo Team on me,
going around back.

37:32.042 --> 37:34.461
Hanna?

37:32.626 --> 37:36.421
-Can I get a bottle of water
to lockdown area four?

37:34.503 --> 37:36.004
Hanna!

37:38.548 --> 37:40.550
Bravo Team in position.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.553
Hanna!

37:49.768 --> 37:51.728
-Nobody here, sir.
-All right.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.355
Search the forest!

37:53.397 --> 37:55.399
-Sir!
-Sir!

37:54.690 --> 37:56.108
Hanna?

38:00.237 --> 38:01.446
Ten meters!

38:01.905 --> 38:03.031
Hanna?

38:03.073 --> 38:04.074
Whoa.

38:06.201 --> 38:09.454
SANDY:
"Hi, Mom. I'm still happy
here at high school.

38:07.327 --> 38:10.038
What are you doing?

38:09.496 --> 38:11.623
"I've been made captain
of the hockey team.

38:10.330 --> 38:11.999
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

38:11.665 --> 38:15.002
"But I'm angry with that friend
I told you about.

38:12.666 --> 38:13.917
Hanna, it's me.

38:15.043 --> 38:17.462
"People can be so cruel.

38:17.504 --> 38:19.006
"I really gave her my trust,

38:19.047 --> 38:21.216
"but she doesn't
understand me at all.

38:21.258 --> 38:23.135
"I think it might be
because she doesn't have

38:23.176 --> 38:24.720
"such a close family.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.722
"Maybe she's jealous.

38:26.763 --> 38:30.475
Maybe she doesn't have the love
in her life that I do."

38:39.693 --> 38:41.653
I'm the only ally you have.

38:43.447 --> 38:46.033
DAUGHTER:
Hey, look, it's from your mom.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.466
You lied to me.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.593
How long until we get there?

39:03.842 --> 39:06.011
You always lie.

39:04.634 --> 39:06.636
Two hours.

39:22.069 --> 39:24.946
SOLDIER:
Group Lima headed
north-northwest.

39:24.988 --> 39:26.990
No eyeball.

39:31.119 --> 39:33.538
I just saw something.

39:40.504 --> 39:43.757
Target contact!
Fall back to the cabin!

39:43.799 --> 39:45.092
Engage!

40:15.163 --> 40:17.541
Can I sit?

40:24.756 --> 40:27.717
-Thank you.
-You want someone
to come with you?

40:27.759 --> 40:30.178
No, I'll be fine. Thank you.

40:31.513 --> 40:34.141
You can really fight,
you know that?

40:36.184 --> 40:38.103
You know why I did it.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.899
Is that all you have to say?

40:42.941 --> 40:45.777
-'Cause I'm the one
giving you a chance here.
-No.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.448
I was wrong.

40:50.490 --> 40:51.533
-To attack me?
-No.

40:51.575 --> 40:53.201
I-I mean yes.

40:53.243 --> 40:55.954
Of course.

40:55.996 --> 40:58.623
But more than that.

40:58.206 --> 40:59.374
Can I help you?

40:58.665 --> 41:00.834
About this... whole place.

40:59.416 --> 41:01.751
My mother is in Room 427.

41:00.876 --> 41:03.170
It's not what I expected.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.211
You okay?

41:04.212 --> 41:06.590
It feels...

41:04.671 --> 41:06.381
Uh, what's her name?

41:06.423 --> 41:08.425
Samira Mahan.

41:06.631 --> 41:07.799
Different.

41:07.674 --> 41:09.176
Who's there?

41:08.466 --> 41:10.886
-"Mahan."
-

41:09.509 --> 41:11.136
Like home.

41:10.927 --> 41:12.137
Okay. Would you like me
to call her?

41:12.179 --> 41:13.597
No, she knows I'm coming.

41:12.179 --> 41:14.431
Maybe it's time you realized

41:13.638 --> 41:15.432
Okay, it's, uh, second floor,
over there.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.599
MARISSA:
Inside.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.349
who your family really are.

41:20.437 --> 41:21.897
Sit.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.571
CLARA:
Uh...

41:29.613 --> 41:32.324
this wasn't like this before.

41:31.239 --> 41:32.365
You watch them all night?

41:32.365 --> 41:34.326
SANDY:
It's cool.

41:32.407 --> 41:34.534
It-it's my job.

41:34.576 --> 41:37.454
They think the cameras
are off but they're not.

41:35.535 --> 41:37.829
I guess.

41:35.911 --> 41:38.330
Mom?

41:38.538 --> 41:39.706
Do you have children?

41:40.332 --> 41:41.917
Mom, it's me.

41:41.708 --> 41:44.002
Do you want them?

41:42.792 --> 41:44.127
SANDY:
Wow.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.962
Mom?

41:44.044 --> 41:46.296
Uh, I don't know.

41:44.169 --> 41:45.795
They know you pretty well.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.631
Do they?

41:46.338 --> 41:48.465
I didn't at your age.

41:47.672 --> 41:50.258
How about... this?

41:48.548 --> 41:49.841
I chose work.

41:50.300 --> 41:52.010
You think it's me?

41:51.218 --> 41:52.719
Sit down, Clara.

41:51.593 --> 41:53.220
I don't regret it.

41:52.052 --> 41:53.929
Try it.

41:52.761 --> 41:54.137
I need to talk to you.

41:53.970 --> 41:55.931
Don't you get it, Clemency?

41:54.179 --> 41:56.556
Where's my mother?

41:55.972 --> 41:58.391
They're giving you
a second chance.

41:56.598 --> 42:00.185
I need to explain what's
happening. Please sit down.

41:56.681 --> 41:59.893
These girls are like
your children, though.

41:59.935 --> 42:01.144
Right?

42:00.227 --> 42:01.853
Where is my mother?

42:01.186 --> 42:04.439
You'd do anything
to protect them.

42:01.895 --> 42:03.855
She's not here.

42:03.897 --> 42:06.024
Stay calm.

42:04.481 --> 42:05.649
I would.

42:06.066 --> 42:08.485
Let me tell you what happened.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.526
CLARA:
What about the others?

42:08.568 --> 42:10.195
Will they be okay?

42:10.237 --> 42:11.947
With me coming back?

42:10.695 --> 42:13.114
Your mother chose to give
you up after you were born.

42:11.988 --> 42:14.574
SANDY:
If they're not,
they'll have me to deal with.

42:13.156 --> 42:14.866
And then, I'm afraid, she died.

42:14.616 --> 42:16.618
You can come eat
with us tonight.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.743
Hello?

42:14.908 --> 42:17.452
That's why you're with us.

42:16.660 --> 42:18.703
And we can go for a walk
in the grounds after.

42:17.494 --> 42:19.829
And why we're so keen
to look after you now.

42:17.744 --> 42:18.995
Dad?

42:18.745 --> 42:20.372
It's really beautiful.

42:19.871 --> 42:22.540
No.

42:20.247 --> 42:21.456
Hanna?

42:21.498 --> 42:24.459
Marissa?

42:22.582 --> 42:24.376
It's okay.

42:22.832 --> 42:24.417
How's it going?

42:24.417 --> 42:29.214
It's not gonna be like it was
before, in the facility.

42:24.459 --> 42:26.086
CLARA:
I'm almost ready.

42:24.501 --> 42:28.004
Listen. We need to move fast.
The guards will be there soon.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.215
Where are you?

42:29.256 --> 42:33.260
I want to show you what it's
going to be like from now on.

42:30.257 --> 42:31.967
I'm in the Meadows.
We need to go.

42:32.008 --> 42:33.969
We have help.
But we have to leave now.

42:34.010 --> 42:35.595
What's your location?

42:37.597 --> 42:39.182
What's your location, Hanna?

42:39.224 --> 42:40.517
I don't know.

42:40.558 --> 42:43.520
We're going to give you
a new life.

42:40.600 --> 42:41.977
Of course you know.

42:42.018 --> 42:44.187
What room are you in?

42:43.561 --> 42:45.146
Your name is Clemency.

42:45.188 --> 42:47.649
You're 18, you're in school.

42:47.691 --> 42:49.859
You live with a big family

42:49.901 --> 42:53.488
in a beautiful house
in Oakland, California.

42:50.110 --> 42:51.152
I don't want to.

42:52.362 --> 42:53.738
I don't want to go.

42:53.530 --> 42:55.490
Your father
is in local government.

42:53.780 --> 42:55.115
Hanna?

42:55.156 --> 42:56.324
Listen to me.

42:55.532 --> 42:59.703
Your mother, here,
she's a teacher.

42:59.744 --> 43:02.998
We can make all this
happen for you.

43:03.039 --> 43:05.166
And I promise
we're gonna give you

43:05.208 --> 43:06.835
-all the love you need.
-I don't want that.

43:06.876 --> 43:08.628
I want her.

43:10.505 --> 43:13.133
I know, but she's gone.

43:22.517 --> 43:24.728
Don't run away from me.

43:27.522 --> 43:29.941
Move in.

43:29.983 --> 43:31.776
SOLDIER:
Copy that.

43:36.948 --> 43:39.075
Mm.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.370
Down! On the ground!

43:44.164 --> 43:46.666
:
No! Let me go!

43:46.708 --> 43:48.835
No! No! Let me go!

43:48.877 --> 43:51.129
Let me go! No!

43:51.171 --> 43:53.131
:
Get off me!

43:53.173 --> 43:55.175
Let me go!

43:53.590 --> 43:55.675
GUARD:
Wiegler's late for her transit.

43:55.717 --> 43:57.886
-We have radio silence
from the isolation zone.
-GUARD 2: Who's down there?

43:57.927 --> 44:00.472
-GUARD: New guy.
-GUARD 2: Go check it out.

44:06.478 --> 44:09.939
You know there's still a place
for you with us if you want.

44:09.981 --> 44:12.233
-You'd trust me with that?
-Well, not everyone can deal

44:12.275 --> 44:13.401
with this kind of work.

44:13.443 --> 44:14.986
You've shown you can.

44:15.028 --> 44:18.823
You didn't leave Hanna
in the forest, did you?

44:17.238 --> 44:19.199
MAN:
Be advised, the girls
have made their way outside

44:19.240 --> 44:20.950
and appear to be
gathering in the garden.

44:20.283 --> 44:22.243
I know you, John.

44:20.992 --> 44:22.660
MAN 2:
Yeah, I've got eyes on them.

44:22.285 --> 44:24.287
Just tell me the truth.

44:22.702 --> 44:24.579
MAN:
Uh, Unit 2, you there?

44:26.373 --> 44:28.625
We found the cabin
in the forest.

44:27.290 --> 44:28.958
Where are you, Marissa?

44:28.666 --> 44:31.044
There was, uh,
a fight of some kind.

44:31.086 --> 44:33.505
A gas explosion in the cabin.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.257
And Hanna?

44:36.299 --> 44:38.968
She was inside.

44:38.593 --> 44:41.221
MARISSA:
Curfew's not over.
Go back to your room.

44:43.765 --> 44:45.642
Marissa, I assure you,

44:45.683 --> 44:48.520
-we never had any intention...
-Just... just get out.

44:58.154 --> 45:00.198
The offer remains open.

44:58.488 --> 45:00.323
Hi.

45:08.832 --> 45:11.209
Hanna, I don't know
what they've said to you,

45:11.251 --> 45:13.044
but you are not safe here.

45:17.006 --> 45:20.301
I worked for these people.

45:20.343 --> 45:22.095
I know them.

45:22.137 --> 45:24.097
And they are not on your side.

45:26.099 --> 45:29.436
I'm so tired of running.

45:28.852 --> 45:31.438
JULES:
...or Charity or Grace.

45:31.479 --> 45:33.440
SANDY:
I don't know why
you're so upset about this.

45:32.605 --> 45:35.275
I know.

45:33.481 --> 45:36.818
JULES:
I'm not upset, I'm just,
I'm just explaining.

45:36.860 --> 45:38.945
-You're upset.
-I'm just explaining

45:38.987 --> 45:41.531
you're, uh-- like we're in
some medieval fucking romance

45:40.947 --> 45:42.991
Listen, I have a friend
waiting outside for us.

45:41.573 --> 45:43.074
with all those men on horses.

45:43.032 --> 45:45.452
He's gonna help us.

45:43.116 --> 45:45.493
Uh-- I don't know where
you're getting this from.

45:45.493 --> 45:47.495
But we need to go  now.

45:45.535 --> 45:47.912
-All right. Guys, come on.
-No. Wait.

45:47.954 --> 45:49.873
-JULES: Come on.
-Why-why did you say that?

45:49.414 --> 45:50.999
The guards are gonna come soon.

45:49.914 --> 45:52.667
JULES:
Because, Sandy, it's a thing.

45:52.709 --> 45:54.127
You got me.

45:54.169 --> 45:55.587
I don't mean anything by it,
Clemency.

45:56.296 --> 45:58.465
That's not your father, Hanna.

45:58.506 --> 46:00.675
That's a computer program.

46:00.717 --> 46:04.262
It's curated by a very smart
young female operative.

46:01.384 --> 46:04.012
HANNA:
Where did you take her?

46:04.304 --> 46:05.513
You've probably met her.

46:07.515 --> 46:10.977
They want you to feel like
you can be loved here.

46:11.019 --> 46:13.229
But that's not true.
You're a weapon to them,

46:13.271 --> 46:14.564
and that's all that you are.

46:15.899 --> 46:19.194
VIRTUAL TEACHER:
Welcome, Sandy, to your
virtual piano lesson.

46:19.068 --> 46:22.363
Erik's gone, honey.

46:19.235 --> 46:22.071
Let's start by hitting a key.

46:22.113 --> 46:24.616
Try this one.

46:22.405 --> 46:24.949
And this...

46:24.991 --> 46:27.160
is not going to replace him.

46:40.173 --> 46:42.967
:
This is an emergency.

46:43.009 --> 46:45.386
All trainees to report
immediately to the main hall

46:45.428 --> 46:46.429
-for roll call.
-

46:46.471 --> 46:48.556
This is an emergency.

46:48.598 --> 46:50.850
All trainees to report
immediately to the main hall

46:50.892 --> 46:52.977
for roll call.

46:56.272 --> 46:58.316
Look, you know what family is.

46:58.358 --> 47:00.109
That is not what
they are offering you here.

47:00.151 --> 47:02.195
Then where is it?
Where do I belong?

47:02.237 --> 47:04.447
With me.

47:04.489 --> 47:08.368
I can look after you.
Please let me try.

47:10.912 --> 47:13.498
:
Two casualties.
Target may be armed.

47:13.540 --> 47:14.707
Received.

47:17.377 --> 47:19.921
and I don't believe it

47:19.003 --> 47:21.339
STEPHEN:
This way.

47:22.131 --> 47:24.342
hate propaganda

47:26.678 --> 47:28.805
into your darkness

47:31.015 --> 47:33.184
to your hatred

47:31.307 --> 47:33.768
Wait. We need her passport.
Hanna, where is it?

47:33.810 --> 47:35.395
-I hid it in the trees.
-Where's the car?

47:35.436 --> 47:36.688
-At the end of the road.
-We'll meet you there.

47:35.645 --> 47:37.939
no, no, no, no

47:36.729 --> 47:38.523
-McCOY: Marks.
-Present.

47:37.981 --> 47:40.066
no, no, no, no, no

47:38.565 --> 47:40.066
-Taylor.
-Present.

47:40.108 --> 47:42.068
no, no, no, no

47:40.108 --> 47:41.526
-Young.
-Present.

47:41.568 --> 47:43.027
-Wolff.
-Here.

47:43.069 --> 47:44.529
Okay, let's move.

47:44.404 --> 47:46.656
I am electric

47:46.531 --> 47:48.199
Two missing.

47:48.241 --> 47:50.952
Wolff.

47:48.741 --> 47:50.952
for your destiny, no

47:50.994 --> 47:52.120
Who else?

47:53.162 --> 47:55.248
to children

47:53.204 --> 47:55.081
Clara.

47:55.290 --> 47:57.375
forced to run

47:57.417 --> 47:59.794
I'm not a minion

47:57.834 --> 47:59.210
Clara wants to be here.

47:59.252 --> 48:01.212
-She chose them.
-I can't leave without her.

48:01.254 --> 48:03.548
You went back once.
It was a mistake.

48:02.130 --> 48:04.507
no, no, no, no

48:03.590 --> 48:06.050
I won't let you
make that mistake again.

48:04.549 --> 48:06.467
no, no, no, no, no

48:06.092 --> 48:07.427
We have to leave  now!

48:06.509 --> 48:08.720
no, no, no, no

48:07.468 --> 48:09.846
Oh!

48:09.929 --> 48:13.683
All units... you have authority
to use full force.

48:16.019 --> 48:17.979
Don't.

48:18.021 --> 48:19.981
She's taking you away.

48:20.064 --> 48:22.275
-I'm helping her escape!
-She doesn't want to escape.

48:22.317 --> 48:24.152
-This is her home.
-No, it isn't.

48:24.193 --> 48:26.070
And it isn't yours, either.

48:26.112 --> 48:27.322
That's not your family, Clara.

48:27.363 --> 48:29.574
My name is Clemency.

48:29.616 --> 48:32.160
-And they're the only
family left to me.
-That's not true.

48:32.201 --> 48:36.039
-You have a mother.
-My mother is dead.
You told me...

48:36.080 --> 48:37.832
No. It was a lie.

48:37.874 --> 48:41.002
They told me to say it
so that they could trap you

48:41.044 --> 48:43.796
and bring you here.
They have lost track of her.

48:43.838 --> 48:46.174
But that doesn't mean
she's dead.

48:47.216 --> 48:50.011
And if she is alive,
I'll help you find her.

48:50.053 --> 48:51.888
You're lying.

48:51.971 --> 48:56.517
No, I'm not.
I swear to God.

48:56.225 --> 48:58.853
no, no, no, no

48:56.559 --> 49:00.480
Mia, don't trust her.

48:58.895 --> 49:00.855
no, no, no, no, no

49:00.521 --> 49:03.358
She's lying about my mother.
And she killed yours.

49:04.942 --> 49:06.653
-Ah!

49:06.694 --> 49:08.196
-

49:09.405 --> 49:10.782
There! In the woods!

49:10.823 --> 49:12.492
GUARD:
Move! Move!

49:21.167 --> 49:23.044
You did the right thing.

49:23.086 --> 49:24.087
GUARD:
Hands above your head!

49:24.128 --> 49:25.880
GUARD 2:
Do as he says!

49:25.922 --> 49:27.507
GUARD:
Hands above your head!

49:36.766 --> 49:38.768
CLARA:
She tried to force Mia
to leave with her.

49:38.810 --> 49:40.561
But Mia shot her.

49:47.402 --> 49:49.320
Get her out of here.

49:49.362 --> 49:51.864
GUARD:
Yes, sir.

49:56.828 --> 50:01.249
It's okay, Mia.
You're safe.

50:03.459 --> 50:05.837
You're with us now.

50:10.174 --> 50:12.176
playing)

50:19.600 --> 50:22.645
I heard the mocking

50:29.819 --> 50:31.738
take a chance

50:33.740 --> 50:35.700
misbehave

51:54.529 --> 51:56.405
-
