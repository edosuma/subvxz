00:03.503 --> 00:05.964
Hi, okay, so I have
an extra ticket

00:06.047 --> 00:07.590
to see Ashlee Simpson
tonight at the Garden.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.634
I was supposed to go with Tina,
but as you know--

00:09.718 --> 00:12.095
(in unison)
You're not speaking to her.

00:12.178 --> 00:15.306
Holly, why don't you just
call Tina and ask her to go?

00:15.390 --> 00:16.933
Because Tina was her best friend

00:17.016 --> 00:19.144
and she slept with Vince,
her ex-boyfriend

00:19.227 --> 00:22.147
who she may or may not
still be in love with.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.816
It's...unforgivable.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.152
Hey, um..

00:27.235 --> 00:29.320
Do you wanna go with me
to the Ashlee Simpson show?

00:29.404 --> 00:32.365
Oh, I love her,
but I can't drive at night.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.618
- Call Tina.
- Too late.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.996
She's already been deleted
and once you've been deleted

00:38.079 --> 00:40.290
you are out of my life forever.

00:40.373 --> 00:43.042
Look, I get that you're hurt,
I do, but don't you think

00:43.126 --> 00:45.295
you're being
just a little bit harsh?

00:45.378 --> 00:47.130
I hate her.

00:47.213 --> 00:49.716
And since when did you think
that loveless sex

00:49.799 --> 00:51.468
and one-night stands are okay?

00:51.551 --> 00:53.803
When I was ten, you told me
that having sex without love

00:53.887 --> 00:56.097
can make a girl's ear fall off.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.977
So have you changed your mind?

01:01.060 --> 01:02.812
- No.
- So you're on my side.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.897
- Of course I am.
- Okay, well, good.

01:04.980 --> 01:07.484
Because my friends
are dropping like flies.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.655
Somebody call
about water damage?

01:12.739 --> 01:14.574
Yeah, it's right over..

01:14.657 --> 01:16.451
Holy crap.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.497
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:20.580 --> 01:22.165
Do you see that guy
who just came in?

01:22.248 --> 01:24.667
Yeah, what the hell
do you think this drool is?

01:27.420 --> 01:29.798
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:29.881 --> 01:30.882
Todd.

01:30.965 --> 01:33.927
You know that beautiful man?

01:34.010 --> 01:37.055
Val Tyler, did you lose
an ear to that man?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.851
Okay, wait, just so we're clear

01:41.935 --> 01:43.770
we're using "losing an ear"
as a metaphor

01:43.853 --> 01:45.730
for "having sex with," right?

01:45.814 --> 01:47.690
- Shh!
- Shut up!

01:47.774 --> 01:50.735
No, you shut up.
It was one night, okay?

01:50.819 --> 01:53.071
I just wanna forget
that it ever happened.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.949
One night?
As in one-night stand?

01:56.032 --> 01:58.535
You dirty bird.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.286
Uh, this pipe's gonna burst.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.871
I might need a hand down here.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.707
Hey, Val, is that the same line
he used on you?

02:06.251 --> 02:09.002
Would you keep it down?
Holly is in the back.

02:09.086 --> 02:10.295
And I have spent my whole life

02:10.380 --> 02:11.881
trying to set
a good example for her.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.592
She can never know that
I had a one-night liaison.

02:14.676 --> 02:17.387

Hi!

03:07.020 --> 03:08.646
I'm so glad you're spending
your lunch break with me.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.356
And you know what I was
thinking about?

03:10.440 --> 03:12.609
The one really great thing
about me hating Vince and Tina

03:12.692 --> 03:14.152
is now you and I get to spend--

03:14.235 --> 03:17.405
- 24 hours a day together.
- Yay!

03:23.286 --> 03:24.579
You smell weird.

03:24.662 --> 03:28.750
Yeah, well, you know,
I had a falafel on the way over.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.376
No, no.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.045
Gary, that's not
a falafel smell.

03:32.128 --> 03:35.465
It's...it's like vanilla and..

03:35.548 --> 03:37.300
...waterfalls and..

03:37.383 --> 03:39.802
Tina!

03:39.886 --> 03:43.473
Where were you for that missing
45 minutes this morning?

03:43.556 --> 03:45.475
- Holly, look--
- You were with her, Gary.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.644
- Weren't ya? Weren't ya?
- No, no.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.812
I-I-I got tickets
to the matinee.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.314
What matinee, huh? Huh?

03:51.397 --> 03:54.067
- Huh?
- "The Vagina Monologues!"

03:54.150 --> 03:55.193
You are such a liar.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.278
It is bad enough
that you live with Vince

03:57.362 --> 04:00.156
the other liar, but now you're
hanging out with Tina too?

04:00.239 --> 04:01.783
Look, just because
you're in a fight with her

04:01.866 --> 04:03.242
doesn't mean I can't
hang with her.

04:03.326 --> 04:04.953
That's exactly what this means.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.955
Do you understand
that this is life, Gary?

04:07.038 --> 04:08.957
You have to pick sides.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.835
You cannot be friends with Tina.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.212
But she smells so good.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.172
I don't care if she smells good.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.925
She's a bad, bad girl.

04:19.007 --> 04:21.844

Me or Tina?

She always looked
kind of troubled.

Well, from what I heard, it was
more than a kiss, so tell.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.196
No offense,
but it's kind of private.

06:45.279 --> 06:48.699

it wasn't that hot.

talked about this

that I never had

intimate relations
till I was 25, but..

10:00.558 --> 10:03.602

I knew you lied to me.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.730
Who cares?
I lie to you all the time.

But in all my 18 years,
I never would have

10:08.649 --> 10:10.735

had a one-night stand

10:36.552 --> 10:39.347
- Uh, tryst.
- There were three of you?

10:40.890 --> 10:43.309
No. Uh. Listen to me, okay?

10:43.392 --> 10:46.312
Holly, look, it might
have been bad judgment

10:46.395 --> 10:48.314
but it was
the spring fling, Holly.

10:48.397 --> 10:50.316
And Rick had just
broken up with me.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.026
Oh, my God, I totally
remember that night.

10:52.109 --> 10:54.236
You told dad that you got
sick at the spring fling

10:54.320 --> 10:56.030
and you had to spend the night
at your friend Debbie's

10:56.113 --> 10:58.324
which is why you missed
my standup act.

10:58.407 --> 10:59.909
So that's why you blew off

10:59.992 --> 11:01.702
your little 10-year-old
sister's standup?

11:01.786 --> 11:04.246
Because you were
with the plumber?

11:04.330 --> 11:06.957
I wasn't a plumber back then.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.793
I had hopes.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.421
Okay, hold on.
Just back it up a second.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.090
You were a standup at ten?

11:14.173 --> 11:17.968
Oh, my God, I was afraid
to take the bus at ten.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.054
I cannot believe
that this is why you missed

11:20.137 --> 11:21.806
one of the biggest days
of my life!

11:21.889 --> 11:24.141
I killed that day at Giggles.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.561
[audience cheering]

11:39.740 --> 11:43.119
Maybe I should have skipped
that 13th candy bar.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.704
[audience cheering]

11:51.001 --> 11:54.922
My parents are always
bugging me to slow down.

11:55.005 --> 11:56.507
Take it easy.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.842
Take a breather.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.927
Hang loose. Chill out.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.721
Take a break.

12:01.804 --> 12:06.475
Hey, why would I wanna
take a break at home?

12:06.559 --> 12:09.311
That's what I go to school for.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.439
[audience laughing]

12:11.522 --> 12:14.066
Yeah, I guess
you had to be there.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.569
Well, it was
very different live!

12:16.652 --> 12:18.487
Not that you would know,
because you were off

12:18.571 --> 12:21.824
bathing in the afterglow
of your friend's boyfriend.

12:21.907 --> 12:25.453
- Ick. Like Tina.
- W-w-wait, wait, wait, wait!

12:25.536 --> 12:27.496
Todd wasn't even
with his girlfriend then.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.331
And-and Rick had just dumped me.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.250
Okay, and let me guess.
You were bummed?

12:31.333 --> 12:32.543
Just like Tina was bummed

12:32.626 --> 12:34.336
when she went over
and slept with Vince.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.046
You two are so screwed up!

12:36.130 --> 12:38.340
Ahh! We're screwed up?
Hey! Hey!

12:38.424 --> 12:40.259
You, little sweetie,
let me tell you something.

12:40.342 --> 12:43.262
Todd and I were both single
at the time, alright?

12:43.345 --> 12:45.556
Just like Vince and Tina
were both single.

12:45.639 --> 12:46.849
The only one who wasn't single

12:46.932 --> 12:48.851
in this little
love triangle was you!

12:48.934 --> 12:50.561
So why don't you take
a look at that, little missy

12:50.644 --> 12:54.190
and then ask yourself,
"Who's the screwed-up one here?"

12:54.273 --> 12:58.068
Oh, my God.
You are <i> so</i> deleted!

12:59.236 --> 13:02.114
Let's see, "Val home."
Delete!

13:02.198 --> 13:04.617
Ha ha ha! There goes
your home number!

13:04.700 --> 13:07.161
Ha ha ha!
We have the same home.

13:07.244 --> 13:08.579
You just deleted yourself.

13:08.662 --> 13:11.040
Well, don't worry. I still
have a million friends left.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.209
Oh, really? Holly,
you better be careful

13:13.292 --> 13:16.170
'cause soon you're gonna delete
everybody from your life!

13:18.589 --> 13:19.882
[phone rings]

13:22.134 --> 13:24.762
Yes, Holly,
we are still friends.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.138
Hey, and since we're friends

13:26.222 --> 13:27.640
do you think you could
set me up on a date

13:27.723 --> 13:30.768
with your sister's
delicious one-night stand?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.649
[phone rings]

13:41.320 --> 13:43.906
Where have you been? Your shift
started a half-hour ago.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.491
Well, I tried to call you,
like, eight times

13:45.574 --> 13:46.659
but your line was busy.

13:46.742 --> 13:50.371
[phone ringing]
Aah, that's why!

13:50.454 --> 13:53.707
Holly won't stop calling,
and I can't take it anymore.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.251
I'm the only one left
on Holly's phone

13:55.334 --> 13:56.794
and she keeps calling me
every two minutes

13:56.877 --> 13:58.546
to complain
about everyone else

13:58.629 --> 14:02.424
and let me tell you, she ain't
the greatest storyteller.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.052
By the way, did you know
she used to do standup?

14:05.135 --> 14:08.973
Maybe I should've skipped
that 13th candy bar!

14:09.056 --> 14:10.266
Yeah, real brilliant stuff.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.602
No, she's driving me crazy!

14:13.686 --> 14:17.147
Not to mention, I've got Val
whining to me about Holly too.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.149
And, hey,
that's where Holly learned

14:19.233 --> 14:21.443
her excellent
storytelling ability.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.362
[snoring]

14:25.656 --> 14:28.534
Okay, alright, stop it,
stop it, make it stop, please!

14:28.617 --> 14:31.579
Okay, I can if you help me.
I've got a plan.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.831
Yeah, me too.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.336
That wasn't my plan.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.630
- But I stopped it.
- Yes, you did.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.008
[telephone rings]

14:46.677 --> 14:49.096
She's ba-a-ack.

14:57.104 --> 14:58.105
Lauren?

14:58.188 --> 15:00.024
Where are you at?

15:11.160 --> 15:12.286
My God.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.247
I've gotta call Val.
Deleted.

15:15.331 --> 15:16.832
I've gotta call Tina,
deleted.

15:16.915 --> 15:19.209
Oh, no, my whole posse's
been deleted!

15:20.836 --> 15:22.588
No!

15:24.089 --> 15:26.175
Okay, Lauren,
I think you can stop

15:26.258 --> 15:27.343
because she's gone.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.970
No. No, she could come back.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.847
No, no, no, no. I-I really
think that she's gone.

15:31.930 --> 15:34.850
Look, it's been a while,
damn it. Just humor me.

15:43.525 --> 15:45.069
Hey.

15:45.152 --> 15:47.029
Hey.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.197
How's Holly?

15:48.280 --> 15:50.741
I wouldn't know.
She's not talking to me.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.034
Why isn't she talking to you?

15:52.117 --> 15:53.160
What'd you do?

15:53.243 --> 15:55.454
Well, the same thing
as you, actually.

15:55.537 --> 15:58.457
Oh, my God.
You slept with Vince too?

15:58.540 --> 16:01.752
Val! Oh, good, you're both here.
You are not gonna believe this.

16:01.835 --> 16:04.713
Gary and Lauren were just
making out in the bakery.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.800
- What?
- Yes, totally making out.

16:07.883 --> 16:08.926
- No way.
- Wait. No!

16:09.009 --> 16:10.010
- Gary and Lauren?
- Yes.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.513
It was all hair and elbows.

16:12.596 --> 16:13.722
- Poor Gary.
- Poor Lauren.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.182
Okay. So come on, let's go!

16:15.265 --> 16:18.394
- Okay, come on!
- Okay, no, no, wait!

16:18.477 --> 16:19.687
We can't do this.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.523
Not without my camera.

16:22.606 --> 16:25.150
I got it, I got it!
Go! Move!

16:27.486 --> 16:29.405
Oh, there they are.
I knew it, I knew it!

16:29.488 --> 16:31.323
Are they coming this time,
or is this a trick?

16:31.407 --> 16:33.117
Okay, just come here.

16:35.577 --> 16:37.913
They're still going at it!

16:37.996 --> 16:40.833
No! Lauren!

16:40.916 --> 16:42.918
How long have you two been..

16:43.001 --> 16:44.712
Oh, you know, not long.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.463
But I do have to say,
the first time

16:46.547 --> 16:50.467
that I saw Lauren,
I-I fell in love.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.844
Really?

16:54.346 --> 16:56.557
Gotcha!

16:56.640 --> 16:59.309
Ha ha ha! Yeah! Yeah!

16:59.393 --> 17:01.145
'We gotcha!'

17:01.228 --> 17:02.938
- What?
- Well, it was a setup.

17:03.021 --> 17:06.900
One, hot, beautiful
ebony and ivory setup.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.194
We figured we had to do
something big

17:10.279 --> 17:11.739
to get you guys talking again.

17:11.821 --> 17:13.906
Oh, my God. Oh.

17:14.907 --> 17:16.702
We're not talking.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.913
But we're talking now,
and it feels really good.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.957
It does feel really good.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.712
Holly, I am so sorry about
what happened with Vince.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.547
I swear to God,
I never meant to hurt you.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.800
You're my best friend and it was
a stupid, stupid thing to do.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.802
Can you ever forgive me?

17:33.886 --> 17:36.263
Tina, you know
what I realized today?

17:37.514 --> 17:39.850
I have no other friends.

17:40.934 --> 17:43.061
Me neither.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.522
And sometimes, friends do
stupid, stupid things.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.024
Especially when they're bummed
because they just got

17:47.107 --> 17:49.526
broken up with,
and they're vulnerable

17:49.610 --> 17:51.862
and they're not
thinking straight

17:51.945 --> 17:55.032
and maybe they're just
a little bit slutty.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.994
Aw, you know me so well.

18:01.580 --> 18:04.333
- What about me?
- Aww, you're slutty too.

18:06.293 --> 18:09.004
Oh, look at 'em, Gary.
We did it.

18:09.087 --> 18:11.131
Do you wanna do it again?

18:11.215 --> 18:13.550
- No.
- Was that a "yes?"

18:17.554 --> 18:18.931
Okay.

18:20.557 --> 18:23.352
- My work here is done.
- Oh, thank you, God.

18:23.435 --> 18:26.021
You can call me Todd.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.314
Ew.

18:27.397 --> 18:28.774
How much do I owe you?

18:28.857 --> 18:32.861
You know, I think dinner
would more than cover it.

18:32.945 --> 18:33.821
Okay.

18:33.904 --> 18:36.698
Let's get this straight,
alright?

18:36.782 --> 18:38.784
What happened in high school
was a one-time thing.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.578
You and I have no magic.

18:41.662 --> 18:44.665
That eyebrow caught me
on a lonely night.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.001
I was vulnerable,
I was heartbroken

18:48.085 --> 18:50.003
I was a stupid kid, but I'm not
a stupid kid anymore.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.965
Never in a million years
would I ever..

19:01.849 --> 19:04.518
I'll pick you up
tomorrow night at 8:00.

19:07.062 --> 19:10.941
So, I-I'm guessing
Brenda's still in Paris?

19:13.777 --> 19:16.738
No. Holly,
you don't think that I--

19:16.822 --> 19:18.073
Val, I'm just kidding.

19:18.156 --> 19:20.450
Don't you know that your
sister's a funny girl?

19:20.534 --> 19:23.245
Right, yes,
how could I forget?

19:25.497 --> 19:29.418
I guess I shouldn't have had
that 13th candy bar!

19:29.501 --> 19:31.795
Well, it's not funny
if you do it like that.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.680
Oh! Oh! I'm so glad that
we're all friends again.

19:41.763 --> 19:45.267
Because now we can all watch
my comedy tape together!

19:45.350 --> 19:48.770
And how glad am I
that you found it?

19:48.854 --> 19:51.899
Now, tell me again, why do
I have to sit through this?

19:51.982 --> 19:55.777
I didn't have sex with
any of your ex-boyfriends.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.070
Holly, I can't believe
we're best friends

19:57.154 --> 19:58.572
and you never told me
about this.

19:58.655 --> 19:59.865
I love standup comedy.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.909
Oh, well, then get ready
to laugh your butt off

20:01.992 --> 20:03.785
because my impression
of Babe the Pig

20:03.869 --> 20:07.122
oinking the alphabet is gonna
make you pee your pants.

20:07.205 --> 20:09.875
Well, I'm sporting new drawers,
so maybe I should leave.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.252
No, no, no, you just
wait a minute, ebony.

20:12.336 --> 20:16.590
As soon as those lights go out,
you belong to ivory.

20:16.673 --> 20:19.718
Holly, leave the lights on.
I'm afraid of the dark.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.762
- Oh, my damn!
- Alright.

20:21.845 --> 20:24.181
You guys ready to pee?

20:25.599 --> 20:29.227
The other day, I got a pimple.

20:29.311 --> 20:33.982
I'm not even a teenager yet,
and I got a pimple.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.695
I mean, seriously,
how adorable was I?

20:40.113 --> 20:42.699
I knew it.
Totally peed the pants.

20:44.242 --> 20:45.953
[chuckles]

20:47.454 --> 20:50.165
I tell ya, that kid
should have her own show.

20:54.628 --> 20:55.712
[theme music]
