WEBVTT

00:09.010 --> 00:10.476
No way.
Our Lou?
I know, eh?

00:10.478 --> 00:13.045
But put him on the dance
floor, you'd think he...

00:13.047 --> 00:14.246
Hey! Happy Feet!

00:14.248 --> 00:15.414
Hey, what's up?

00:15.416 --> 00:16.382
Got the
pictures?
Yeah.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.716
Jamaica.
Yes, Ocho Rios.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.084
I want to see them.

00:19.086 --> 00:20.652
Oh, yeah.
110 degrees
in the shade.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.021
Check out our man here.

00:22.023 --> 00:23.655
He got a bit
of a tan.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.024
(laughs)

00:25.026 --> 00:26.258
Fast-forwarding to Bridget?

00:26.260 --> 00:27.426
Yeah, look at that.

00:27.428 --> 00:28.460
JULES: Who's Bridget?
Who's Bridget?

00:28.462 --> 00:29.695
SAM:
She's hot.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.063
Huh?

00:31.065 --> 00:32.297
I hadn't seen her
since high school.

00:32.299 --> 00:34.533
And then I don't see
this guy for three days.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.501
Really?

00:35.503 --> 00:37.102
You think
it's the real deal?

00:37.104 --> 00:38.570
Destiny speaks,
I don't ask questions.

00:42.343 --> 00:45.411
So Sheila's freaking out about
Joey talking or not talking.

00:45.413 --> 00:46.612
Kid's one and a half.

00:46.613 --> 00:47.812
Tell her to cut
him some slack.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.481
This is Sheila
we're talking about.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.450
The word "slack" is not
in her vocabulary.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.318
MAN 2:
He got any new words?

00:53.320 --> 00:55.320
MAN:
Yeah, "Up, Dada."

00:55.322 --> 00:57.122
MAN 2: No "Mama"?
MAN: No.

00:57.124 --> 00:58.557
MAN 2:
There's the problem.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.492
Got to teach him "Mama."

01:02.363 --> 01:03.796
Pretty quiet.

01:03.798 --> 01:06.598
Yeah, great for
writing reports.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.644
Thinking I'd go down
to the range.

01:07.645 --> 01:08.689
I've got some new ammo
for the Remmy.

01:08.690 --> 01:09.734
Homework first.
Then go play.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.303
WINNIE:
Strategic Response Unit.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.771
How did I know
you'd say that?
'Cause you know me.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.339
Boss.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.141
MALE VOICE:
In ten minutes

01:16.143 --> 01:18.510
the future headquarters
of Globalmax Energy Group

01:18.512 --> 01:20.512
will be destroyed by a bomb.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.347
I'm Sergeant Parker.
Who am I talking to?

01:22.349 --> 01:24.116
In ten minutes the future
headquarters...

01:24.118 --> 01:26.852
Prerecorded.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.287
WINNIE:
Is this for real?

01:28.289 --> 01:29.555
We move like it is.
ED:
Bomb call!

01:29.557 --> 01:31.190
Let's go!
(alarm sounds)

01:31.192 --> 01:33.125
Can we trace that call,
Winnie?
No.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.526
It's VOIP, rerouted
through an anonymous server.

01:34.528 --> 01:36.528
Future headquarters.
It's a construction site.

01:36.530 --> 01:39.398
Okay, find out
where Globalmax is building.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.499
Get a hold of the foreman,
patch him

01:40.501 --> 01:41.767
through to my phone.

01:41.769 --> 01:42.801
Got it.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.603
(sirens wailing)

01:44.605 --> 01:46.305
WINNIE:<i> Foreman's not</i>
<i> picking up, Sarge.</i>

01:46.307 --> 01:47.539
<i> I'll keep trying.</i>

01:47.541 --> 01:49.575
(saw buzzing)

01:49.577 --> 01:51.643
(indistinct chattering)

01:55.483 --> 01:57.649
(sirens wailing)

01:57.651 --> 01:59.718
(phone ringing)

02:02.590 --> 02:03.789
Yeah.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.892
This is Sergeant Greg Parker
with the police.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.461
We've received a bomb threat
targeting your

02:09.463 --> 02:10.629
construction site.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.197
Speak up. I can't hear you.

02:12.199 --> 02:13.365
Jimmy, kill it!

02:13.367 --> 02:14.500
Yeah, go again.

02:14.502 --> 02:15.734
This is the police.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.402
We've received a bomb threat.

02:17.404 --> 02:18.770
You need to evacuate.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.873
Come on. Haven't got time
for this. Who's this?

02:20.875 --> 02:22.474
Sir, this is not a prank.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.575
We've received
a bomb threat.

02:23.577 --> 02:24.643
You need to evacuate

02:24.645 --> 02:25.711
now.

02:25.713 --> 02:26.912
(sirens approaching)

02:26.914 --> 02:28.413
There's a bomb.

02:28.415 --> 02:29.648
(shouting)
There's a bomb!

02:29.650 --> 02:31.583
Everybody evacuate!

02:31.585 --> 02:32.918
Get out! Now!
Move it!

02:32.920 --> 02:34.419
Evacuate!

02:34.421 --> 02:35.921
Let's go!

02:35.923 --> 02:37.422
MAN:
Everybody out now!

02:37.424 --> 02:39.658
I need everyone
off the site now!

02:39.660 --> 02:40.626
This is the foreman!

02:40.628 --> 02:42.294
This is not a test!

02:42.296 --> 02:45.664
(sirens wailing)

02:45.666 --> 02:46.598
FOREMAN:
There's a bomb.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.733
Everyone off
the site now!

02:47.735 --> 02:49.568
It's an emergency! Move!

02:49.570 --> 02:51.203
Move! Move! Move!

02:51.205 --> 02:52.905
Keep moving! Let's go!
Off the site.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.206
(sirens wailing)

02:54.208 --> 02:57.509
(explosion)

02:59.480 --> 03:00.879
PARKER: Everyone okay?
I'm all right.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.714
I'm good, boss.
JULES: We're good.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.183
ED:
I'm good.

03:04.185 --> 03:06.218
SPIKE:
Yeah, me, too, boss.

03:08.556 --> 03:09.855
You okay, buddy?

03:09.857 --> 03:10.856
Yeah.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.824
Get an EMT
here right away.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.193
Everybody
get out okay?

03:14.195 --> 03:15.861
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
I think so.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.763
We got to do a head count.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.598
(typing)

03:19.600 --> 03:20.699
Sarge,

03:20.701 --> 03:21.667
priority call.

03:21.669 --> 03:22.834
Patch it through.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.536
MALE VOICE:
A bomb has been placed

03:24.538 --> 03:27.673
in the offices of a known
environmental criminal,

03:27.675 --> 03:30.809
and it will detonate
in one hour.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.314
PARKER:
Priority one: we
profile the subject,

03:35.316 --> 03:36.815
locate the target,
intercept it in time.

03:36.817 --> 03:37.983
All right? Spike?

03:37.985 --> 03:40.319
Lou and I will check
for a followup bomb.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.588
If we're clear, we'll run
diagnostics on the site.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.590
See what we can learn
from the bomber's materials.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.759
Boss, I had a look
at a lot of IEDs in Afghanistan.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.661
That's great.
Give them a hand.
All right.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.296
Wordy, let's take
the witnesses.
Got it.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.431
PARKER:
Jules, command truck.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.765
Let's get to
know our friend.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.704
PARKER:
What do you have, Spike?

03:58.706 --> 04:00.239
SPIKE:
Okay.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.474
Blast radius,
3.2 meters.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.642
Depth-- 1.6 meters.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.943
So, explosive force

04:04.945 --> 04:06.778
of about 3,000 kilojoules.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.647
That narrows it down.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.949
What have we got on
Globalmax Energy Group?

04:10.951 --> 04:12.751
Phew! Well,
they patented a method

04:12.753 --> 04:14.653
of extracting crude
from the tar sands.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.723
Effective,
but environmentally toxic.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.608
Okay, let's
talk to CSIS,

04:19.609 --> 04:21.492
see who they've got on
their eco-terror watch list.

04:21.495 --> 04:22.661
Boss?

04:22.663 --> 04:24.463
PARKER:
Yeah, Lou, go ahead.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.264
Ion scanner's identified
the explosive. It's TNT.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.733
Can we trace it?
SPIKE:
Yup.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.435
The residue-- it has tracer
elements embedded into it.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.537
The lab can trace it
right to the manufacturer,

04:32.539 --> 04:34.640
right down to where the shipment
was delivered, and from there...

04:34.642 --> 04:35.907
Okay, you had me at "yup."
Let's do it.

04:35.909 --> 04:36.908
Copy that.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.710
Spike, check this out.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.579
We can trace this.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.614
Has solder on it.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.815
This battery
set it off.

04:43.817 --> 04:44.916
We got bar code.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.852
Sweet, Sam. Nice.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.588
Eddie, any leads on a suspect?

04:49.590 --> 04:51.590
We're working on it.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.592
I can't believe
they went this far.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.927
These guys are a
royal pain in the butt.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.630
They're here every
day like clockwork.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.199
(clamoring)

05:00.200 --> 05:01.767
<i> And yesterday,</i>
<i> things got out of control.</i>

05:01.769 --> 05:03.535
Globalmax murders
the planet!

05:03.537 --> 05:04.903
We are not moving!

05:04.905 --> 05:06.438
You are not...

05:06.440 --> 05:07.739
Hold on one minute.
I'll get rid of them.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.007
MAN:
You are not getting
through here!

05:09.009 --> 05:10.475
Call your boss,
call your boss's boss.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.910
Tell him we
are not moving.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.645
Tell him he's accountable
for murdering the planet.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.681
You go call him.
I got a job to do.

05:15.683 --> 05:16.782
Get out of here!

05:16.784 --> 05:17.983
No, we're not moving!

05:17.985 --> 05:19.685
We are not moving!

05:19.687 --> 05:21.420
We are not
moving.
Okay, move it in.
Let's go.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.622
Move it in.
Move it in!

05:23.624 --> 05:25.824
You are not getting
through here.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.461
You are not getting...
I said move.
I meant,

05:29.463 --> 05:30.762
move!

05:30.764 --> 05:32.764
Get out of here!

05:32.766 --> 05:33.932
This is not over.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.867
I'm gonna be
your worst nightmare.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.936
We are taking this
to the next level!

05:37.938 --> 05:40.038
Boss, we have threats
uttered yesterday by a member

05:40.040 --> 05:42.507
of an activist group called
the Olive Branch Collective.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.743
He wanted to take the protest
to the next level.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.345
JULES:
Olive Branch.

05:46.347 --> 05:48.914
Yup. They are on
the CSIS watch list.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.982
It's not exactly
a covert operation.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.818
They've got a downtown
office address.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.820
Okay, here's
what we go.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.822
We've narrowed the list
of potential targets

05:56.824 --> 05:58.123
to three
possibilities.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.525
Keffler Corp, DuChamp Energy
and Morgan-Ellis.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.693
Now, they're all

06:01.695 --> 06:02.861
toxic bad boys
fighting charges

06:02.863 --> 06:04.997
under the Environmental
Protection Act.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.132
All right, good. We'll talk
to the heads of their security.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.668
We'll coordinate an immediate
evac with fire and police.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.837
All right, let's go.
JULES:
Let's go.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.772
We'll take Sam to help
handle the bomb sweeps,

06:13.774 --> 06:15.640
split the targets
with the bomb techs

06:15.642 --> 06:16.908
from Team Two
and Team Five.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.744
While you guys shake down
the tree-huggers.

06:18.746 --> 06:19.811
PARKER:
Environmental activists.

06:19.813 --> 06:20.979
Whatever.

06:20.981 --> 06:24.049
(siren wailing)

06:24.051 --> 06:27.018
(tires screeching)

06:35.062 --> 06:36.661
Hey, let's see
your warrant.

06:36.663 --> 06:39.164
We don't need a warrant
to walk through an open door.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.600
Oh, no warrant? Yeah, then
you can turn around and walk

06:41.602 --> 06:42.768
right out that open door.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.102
It's okay, Jordan.
I'm John Martens.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.821
Can I help you?

06:45.822 --> 06:47.539
Sergeant Greg Parker.
Officer Jules Callaghan.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.007
Wanted to ask you
a few questions

06:49.009 --> 06:50.609
about a bomb that was detonated

06:50.611 --> 06:52.161
at a construction site.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.712
Globalmax Energy Group.
I just read the news-feed.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.714
We understand
you were there yesterday.

06:55.716 --> 06:56.982
Yeah, we staged a lawful
non-violent protest action.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.084
Foreman said
that you uttered threats

06:59.086 --> 07:00.919
to take it to the next level.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.554
I threatened him?

07:02.556 --> 07:03.889
Have a look.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.435
You tell him

07:16.437 --> 07:18.170
take it to the next level
means unleash the most badass

07:18.172 --> 07:19.838
Internet petition in history.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.373
We don't do bombs.

07:21.374 --> 07:22.907
We start with the
carnage, we lose

07:22.910 --> 07:24.693
the public.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.477
No more donations,
our revenue streams dry up.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.180
Violence runs counter
to our business model.

07:28.182 --> 07:30.215
Business models
and revenue streams?

07:30.217 --> 07:31.850
The times they
are a-changin'.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.486
Yeah, well, just because
he speaks MBA doesn't mean

07:34.488 --> 07:36.721
they're not
into something harder.

07:36.723 --> 07:39.024
Hey, what if one of his
comrades went rogue?

07:39.026 --> 07:41.993
Or maybe John Martens
is hiding in plain sight.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.198
Winnie,

07:46.200 --> 07:48.967
let's get a hold of 41 Division,
let's send an undercover

07:48.969 --> 07:51.937
unit to surveil John Martens
and the Olive Branch.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.905
Copy that.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.944
ED:
Okay, let's split up.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.645
Report back with evac status.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.515
We're gonna start at the bottom,
work our way up with Fido here.

08:03.517 --> 08:04.850
Copy.
Got it.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.919
SPIKE:
<i> Boss.</i>

08:07.921 --> 08:09.404
We got something.

08:09.405 --> 08:10.888
We've been working
on finding our guy's signature.

08:10.891 --> 08:11.957
Signature?

08:11.959 --> 08:12.891
Yeah, bombers.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.059
They tend to be consistent.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.627
They find their
favorite materials

08:15.628 --> 08:17.194
and their techniques,
and they stick to them.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.698
So it could be a specific
photo-electric sensor

08:19.700 --> 08:20.699
from a smoke detector...

08:20.701 --> 08:21.900
Okay.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.235
Or a specific pattern
of circuits.

08:23.237 --> 08:24.903
So we ran all the elements

08:24.905 --> 08:25.971
through the federal
signature database.

08:25.973 --> 08:26.972
Find a match?

08:26.974 --> 08:28.607
Yeah, boss, I know the database

08:28.609 --> 08:30.141
doesn't lie, but Lou's
never heard of these guys.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.977
I never heard
of these guys.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.078
The PLC--
People's Liberation

08:33.080 --> 08:34.279
Corps.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.047
PLC.
That goes back.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.550
Winnie, you got anything for us?

08:38.552 --> 08:40.852
Uh, full membership
number unknown.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.287
Ah. String of
environmentally-related

08:42.289 --> 08:44.222
bombings, late '70s.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.692
Leaders Vanessa and Sheldon
Kominski arrested in 1980.

08:47.694 --> 08:48.894
Okay, any recent activity?

08:48.896 --> 08:50.161
Nothing reported.

08:50.163 --> 08:51.963
What about our
friends the Kominskis?

08:51.965 --> 08:55.867
Vanessa and Sheldon Kominski are
now faculty at the university.

08:55.869 --> 08:56.968
How's that?

08:56.970 --> 08:58.703
Professors emeritus, Poli-Sci.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.739
Professors, huh?

09:00.741 --> 09:03.141
Times are a-changin'.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.946
This is the most powerful
aspect of hegemony.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.781
State control
is redundant.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.017
We've internalized
the values that...

09:12.019 --> 09:13.919
Sheldon and
Vanessa Kominski?

09:13.921 --> 09:15.253
We need a word with you.

09:15.255 --> 09:18.690
Speaking of state control,
is today show and tell?

09:18.692 --> 09:20.292
(laughter)

09:23.196 --> 09:26.064
We've always been very open
about our past with the PLC.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.633
It's probably what gives us
credibility with our students.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.001
But the membership's

09:30.003 --> 09:32.103
long dispersed, and we've had
a lot of time to think

09:32.105 --> 09:33.939
as one does
behind bars.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.041
Besides, as soon
as we were released,

09:36.043 --> 09:37.576
I got pregnant with Sara.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.328
Is this Sara?

09:39.329 --> 09:41.079
VANESSA:
Yes. How could we run around
being outlaws

09:41.081 --> 09:42.814
when we had
a responsibility to her?

09:42.816 --> 09:44.082
Okay, well, then,
how do you explain

09:44.084 --> 09:46.952
that this morning's bomb
had the PLC's signature?

09:46.954 --> 09:49.854
Uh, there was only one
bomb technician among us,

09:49.856 --> 09:51.156
Rafer Wilcox.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.724
Where do we find him?

09:52.726 --> 09:53.992
No idea. We hardly see him.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.460
27 minutes

09:55.461 --> 09:56.927
until the next bomb goes off.
Think hard.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.363
We need to
talk to him.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.099
Rafer's always lived
off the grid, on principle.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.035
And to tell the truth, ever
since we had Sara, we've kept

10:04.037 --> 10:05.270
our distance.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.639
Okay, but is there something
you can give us?

10:07.641 --> 10:09.007
A former address? An alias?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.976
He used to go by Simon Richdale.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.144
Other times,
it was Ronald Mellor.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.348
That's great. Thank you
very much for your time.

10:16.350 --> 10:17.349
Boss.

10:17.351 --> 10:18.817
Eddie.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.253
We're in the machine room,
Keffler Corp.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.789
We've got bomb number two.

10:24.791 --> 10:28.393
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

10:59.259 --> 11:01.192
<i> 11:43 a.m.,</i>

11:01.194 --> 11:03.028
bomb call,
robot sending out signal

11:03.030 --> 11:04.796
blocking remote detonation.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.165
SPIKE:
We're sending in Babycakes.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.035
Assuming the device is triggered

11:10.037 --> 11:11.870
by a timer, boss,
we got 25 minutes

11:11.872 --> 11:14.072
until detonation.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.841
That's also assuming our guy's
any good at setting timers.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.843
And that he plans on sticking
to the schedule.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.345
Spike, I'm going to come out
there and give you a hand.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.346
Forget it.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.914
Rule number one of defusion.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.282
Don't blow stuff up?

11:24.284 --> 11:27.018
Never more than one man
downrange.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.203
You know that.

11:28.204 --> 11:29.387
Let's go. Let's
keep this moving.

11:29.389 --> 11:32.090
We need to evacuate this
building immediately.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.025
Sorry ma'am, we need
to keep moving.
Let me get this.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.510
Just take a sec.
I'm afraid
there's no time.

11:35.511 --> 11:36.994
There's no time.
We need you to keep moving.
Oh, my God!

11:36.997 --> 11:38.396
I didn't get my laptop.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.131
I have to go back for it.
It'll only take a minute.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.433
I've got 11 years work on it.
Ma'am,

11:41.435 --> 11:43.168
if anything happens, I'm
not going to be the one

11:43.170 --> 11:44.469
to tell your family "It was
just gonna take a minute."

11:44.471 --> 11:45.704
Let's keep moving.

11:45.706 --> 11:46.938
PARKER:
Winnie,

11:46.940 --> 11:49.007
has the lab come back with
anything on the TNT?

11:51.278 --> 11:52.294
WINNIE:
Just in.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.311
Manufacturer's name
is ProCan Chemical.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.346
That's great.
Now, let's look into purchases

11:55.348 --> 11:56.981
made by a Ronald Mellor

11:56.983 --> 11:58.183
or a Simon Richdale,

11:58.185 --> 12:00.318
last six months.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.720
Copy that.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.021
I'll red flag large quantities.

12:03.022 --> 12:04.321
No, negative.
Not large quantities.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.157
Large quantities
is for legitimate

12:06.159 --> 12:07.509
industrial clients.

12:07.510 --> 12:08.860
You're looking for small
quantities only.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.028
I knew that.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.463
ED:
Building's secure.

12:11.465 --> 12:12.497
Spike's the only remaining

12:12.499 --> 12:14.165
personnel.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.200
SPIKE:
And Babycakes.

12:15.202 --> 12:16.367
Don't forget Babycakes.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.803
(mechanical whirring)

12:18.805 --> 12:20.071
Okay, Spike,

12:20.073 --> 12:21.206
read me the tea leaves.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.274
Okay, you see that shadow,
top left?

12:23.276 --> 12:25.410
That's looking like a digital
clock-- so it is set

12:25.412 --> 12:27.145
to trigger by timer.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.214
Let's set up transport
to move this bomb off-site.

12:29.216 --> 12:30.749
We got 21 minutes.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.284
Except you see those
two shadows, bottom left?

12:33.286 --> 12:35.053
Those are mercury switches.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.222
Motion sensitive.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.757
Motion very sensitive.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.442
Can't move it.

12:40.443 --> 12:42.126
Going to take human hands
not to set it off.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.328
I'm going in.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.462
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.231
Spike...

12:49.936 --> 12:51.936
Okay. Okay.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.671
Copy that.

12:53.672 --> 12:55.405
(phone rings)
Sarge, we got another call
coming through.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.242
I'm patching this one in live.

12:57.244 --> 13:00.211
MALE VOICE:
The third bomb
will detonate 12:30 p.m.

13:00.213 --> 13:04.182
on the campus of Halliwell
Technical College.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.484
The third bomb
will detonate 12:30 p.m.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.486
on the campus of....
Okay.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.022
All right,
that's 40 minutes from now.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.457
He's picking up the pace.
Dividing to conquer.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.558
Jules, you stay here with Spike.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.094
Lou, let's get
to the college.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.195
Eddie?

13:17.197 --> 13:19.264
On it.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.874
Lou, get a head start
on the scans.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.509
I'll catch up
as soon as I can, okay?

13:31.511 --> 13:33.244
LEWIS:
Copy that.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.883
(beeping)

13:38.885 --> 13:41.820
You've got to be kidding me.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.256
I got a match.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.225
TNT delivery
to a Simon Richdale.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.960
(siren wailing)
That's Rafer's alias.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.195
What's the address?

13:50.197 --> 13:52.230
788 Joliet in Parkdale.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.198
ED:
Boss, that's close.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.232
Change of plans.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.867
We're going to drop in on Rafer.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.135
He might have answers,

13:57.137 --> 13:59.103
or demands,
or something we can use.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.242
Police!

14:04.244 --> 14:05.443
Strategic Response Unit!

14:05.445 --> 14:07.145
Police!
Stay where you are!

14:07.147 --> 14:08.379
Show us your hands!

14:08.381 --> 14:10.849
Wordy.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.585
Hands in the air!

14:13.587 --> 14:15.286
Or you'll shoot me?

14:15.288 --> 14:17.155
Rafer Wilcox?

14:17.157 --> 14:18.189
Uh-huh.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.324
ED:
Put down the syringe!

14:19.326 --> 14:20.325
Relax.

14:20.327 --> 14:21.359
Nothing in it.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.194
Put it down!

14:23.196 --> 14:24.229
No.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.548
WORDY:
Clear upstairs.

14:26.549 --> 14:28.866
You TNT had delivered
to this address three weeks ago.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.068
RAFER:
That's right.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.302
ED:
For what purpose?

14:31.304 --> 14:34.172
To blow stuff up.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.340
Boss, we got a trapdoor.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.180
You're responsible
for the bombs?

14:42.182 --> 14:43.214
RAFER:
No.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.716
Globalmax
Energy Group

14:44.717 --> 14:46.217
and Keffler are responsible
for the bombs.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.518
We just put them there.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.553
(coughing)

14:48.555 --> 14:49.587
You sick here, buddy?

14:49.589 --> 14:51.022
What's going on?

14:51.024 --> 14:52.323
It ain't catching.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.325
Hands in the air!

14:54.327 --> 14:57.462
All right.
ED:
Put it down! Put it down!

14:57.464 --> 14:59.397
Winnie,
we need an EMT!

14:59.399 --> 15:01.466
Won't get here in time.

15:05.238 --> 15:08.106
Then you're going
to talk fast.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.677
Sarge, we found his maps.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.913
The third bomb is located

15:14.915 --> 15:17.615
at the foot of
the Earth Sciences building.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.317
SAM:
And he knows
what he's doing.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.985
He's planted the bomb
at a support column--

15:20.987 --> 15:22.921
it blows, that
building comes down.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.956
Copy that. We're seconds away.
(siren wailing)

15:24.958 --> 15:28.092
The good news is, it looks like
it's the last of three targets.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.494
You said,
"We just put them there."

15:29.496 --> 15:31.362
Is this the PLC?
No.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.498
The Kominskis took everything
we fought for,

15:33.500 --> 15:35.333
spat on it and sold it out

15:35.335 --> 15:37.235
for an ivory
tower tenure.
Schematics
for the bombs?

15:37.237 --> 15:39.237
We just need the schematics
for the bombs.
I'm running out of time

15:39.239 --> 15:41.239
to make a difference,
Just give me
the schematics...

15:41.241 --> 15:42.640
so I'm calling
the shots now.
Okay.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.309
We're getting the
message out.
Okay.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.110
Okay, you and who else?
You and who else?

15:46.112 --> 15:47.145
I can't hear you.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.279
There are lives
at stake here!

15:48.281 --> 15:49.714
No, you don't get
to lecture me

15:49.716 --> 15:51.249
about human
lives, jackboot.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.284
We need to defuse
the bombs, please.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.552
How do you defuse the bombs?

15:54.554 --> 15:56.254
I'm not the
one to blame
Rafer, please.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.256
for collateral damage.
Come on.
You and who else?

15:58.258 --> 15:59.624
This is...
You and who else?

15:59.625 --> 16:00.991
this is what
I'm here for.
You... okay.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.293
You and who else?
You and who else?

16:02.295 --> 16:04.162
You and who else?
You and who else, please?

16:04.164 --> 16:05.430
(gasping)

16:05.432 --> 16:07.398
(exhaling)

16:15.342 --> 16:17.408
(screams)

16:27.153 --> 16:29.220
(siren wailing)
He gave himself a heart attack?

16:29.222 --> 16:31.122
He injected himself with air.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.191
Okay, did you get anything
out of him, Eddie?

16:33.193 --> 16:35.193
Yeah, he's not working alone.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.195
And he was sick.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.197
SAM:
Yeah, his hands
were shaking.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.065
Assembling a bomb
is precision work.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.433
He'd need someone
with steady hands.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.468
Let's tear this place apart.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.169
We look for e-mails, letters,

16:45.171 --> 16:47.205
anything that can help us
ID the accomplice.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.540
Let's go.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.477
And, guys, schematics.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.479
Schematics would be great.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.014
PARKER:
All right, team.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.649
Our subject,
may he rest in peace,

16:58.651 --> 17:00.685
has left us juggling
an unidentified

17:00.687 --> 17:04.055
<i> accomplice</i>
<i> and two scheduled detonations.</i>

17:04.057 --> 17:05.690
11 minutes to go
on the Keffler Corp bomb,

17:05.692 --> 17:08.226
29 minutes to go

17:08.228 --> 17:10.161
on the Halliwell
College bomb.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.530
This guy wants to save
the world, make a big statement.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.565
"Oh, I know, let's blow up
some college students.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.401
That'd be good."
It's not just that.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.736
Halliwell College just signed
a huge funding deal

17:18.738 --> 17:20.171
with the Lyrium think tank.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.506
The global warming deniers.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.207
PARKER:
The way he saw it

17:23.209 --> 17:26.210
they're brainwashing a new
generation of climate killers.

17:26.212 --> 17:28.212
Sarge... Halliwell? Lyrium?

17:28.214 --> 17:30.214
Is there anything
you don't know?

17:30.216 --> 17:32.517
It's the burden I bear, Wordy.
<i> That...</i>

17:32.519 --> 17:34.585
and it was a feature article
in the<i> Star</i> last weekend.

17:34.587 --> 17:35.686
Ouch.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.221
Thank you, Constable Callaghan.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.223
How we doing
on tracing that battery?

17:39.225 --> 17:40.258
Well, it's a common

17:40.260 --> 17:41.526
brand and a partial bar code,

17:41.528 --> 17:42.560
so I'll keep you posted.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.429
Copy that. Thanks.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.299
Spike, what kind of schematic
are we looking for?

17:48.301 --> 17:50.601
Anything showing a circuit
and three batteries.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.303
I'm flying blind here.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.771
Half these wires are dummy,

17:53.772 --> 17:55.238
and he's given me three
det wires to choose from.

17:55.241 --> 17:58.209
I cut the wrong one, or I even
touch a crush wire...

17:58.211 --> 17:59.444
Copy that.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.678
If we run out of time,

18:00.680 --> 18:02.647
I'm going to have to walk away,
let it blow.

18:02.649 --> 18:03.648
Copy?

18:03.650 --> 18:05.516
SAM:
Copy.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.418
Hey, Inspector.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.953
How you doing?
Sergeant.

18:08.954 --> 18:10.487
Our bomb's at the base
of that pillar there.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.457
It's under
the garbage bags.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.292
Okay, I'll get started
on the reckie.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.426
And our evacuation's
in progress.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.627
Thank you, Inspector.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.429
JULES:
Winnie, any update
on that battery?

18:18.431 --> 18:21.132
I've traced the serial number
and the expiry date

18:21.134 --> 18:23.468
to a Bulk Club outlet
in Mississauga.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.802
A lot shipped two weeks ago.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.271
That's great.
Bulk Club works by membership.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.506
I've checked
the membership records.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.608
There's no Rafer Wilcox
or any of his aliases.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.276
Well, it's his accomplice
that we're looking for.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.145
Can you upload the Bulk Club
security feed to me, please?

18:34.147 --> 18:35.313
I'm on it.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.381
(indistinct shouting)

18:40.553 --> 18:42.153
SPIKE:
Lou, we're looking for anyone

18:42.155 --> 18:43.654
or anything
that looks out of place.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.892
Any sign of a pull-wire
near the device?
LEWIS: Okay.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.361
It's hidden by garbage bags, but
there's nothing extending out.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.462
OFFICER:
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

18:51.464 --> 18:53.164
I don't see anything.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.365
How we doing, Wordy?

18:54.367 --> 18:55.766
Not great.

18:55.768 --> 18:59.237
Our pal Rafer was pretty fond
of his paper shredder.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.571
Spike, good news.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.640
Got schematics
for all three bombs,

19:02.642 --> 19:04.375
including one
with three batteries.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.410
Samtastic!
Upload me a photo, would ya?

19:06.412 --> 19:08.479
One minute.

19:10.583 --> 19:11.749
Clock's running down, Spike.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.501
How you doing?
Boss.

19:13.502 --> 19:15.252
We got the schematics.
Let me get a head start.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.421
No, no, no, I'll be there.
I'm nearly done here.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.157
Spike, I've seen you

19:19.159 --> 19:21.392
do it, okay?
I can handle a pair of cutters.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.793
Copy that.
We're gonna lose people here.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.463
Okay. Go.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.502
Going downrange.

19:48.421 --> 19:51.189
Okay, I'm on scene, Spike.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.324
Okay, Lou, you said
three garbage bags?

19:53.326 --> 19:55.226
Anything rigged if they move?

20:02.335 --> 20:04.936
Okay...

20:04.938 --> 20:07.305
no visible booby traps,
no wiring.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.324
Okay, that's good.

20:09.325 --> 20:11.342
So you get those garbage bags
out of the way, okay?

20:11.344 --> 20:12.810
Take it real slow.

20:12.811 --> 20:14.277
Make sure they don't touch
the device.

20:32.532 --> 20:37.535
Okay, I have 360 access
to the device.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.370
It's a shaped charge, Spike.

20:39.372 --> 20:40.404
It's big, man.

20:44.510 --> 20:45.576
(loud click)

20:47.947 --> 20:49.680
Guys...

20:49.682 --> 20:51.015
What is it?

20:51.017 --> 20:53.451
Lou?

20:55.488 --> 20:57.722
I think I just stepped
on a land mine.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.642
PARKER:
Come again, Lou?

21:17.644 --> 21:19.677
I stepped on a land mine.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.612
How do you know that?

21:21.614 --> 21:24.015
Heard the click.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.417
I can feel the trigger spikes
through my boot.

21:29.989 --> 21:33.357
Okay, Lou, the important thing
is just stay calm.

21:33.359 --> 21:34.725
I'm calm.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.762
Okay? Yeah?

21:37.764 --> 21:39.297
Yeah, I'm good, boss.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.064
Okay, you just make sure...

21:40.066 --> 21:41.065
I'm not moving.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.834
All right, good,
you just relax.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.803
Lou, don't even

21:45.805 --> 21:47.004
shift your weight, okay?

21:47.006 --> 21:48.456
No decrease

21:48.457 --> 21:49.907
in pressure.
Okay, I got you, Spike.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.709
PARKER: Spike...
I'm gonna get this thing nailed,

21:51.711 --> 21:53.344
and then I'm on my way.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.679
I'm gonna get you out,
buddy, okay?

21:54.681 --> 21:56.547
I'm gonna get you out.

21:56.549 --> 21:57.882
Spike, you just stay focused,
okay?

21:57.884 --> 22:00.201
We're all good here.

22:00.202 --> 22:02.519
Boss, how much time we got left
on this bomb?

22:04.457 --> 22:06.324
We got, uh, we got...

22:06.326 --> 22:09.593
(siren whoops)
we got time, Lou.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.865
(dialing phone)

22:14.867 --> 22:19.737
(line ringing)

22:19.739 --> 22:21.806
PARKER:
Eddie, go to channel four.

22:21.808 --> 22:22.973
What do you think
we're looking at?

22:22.975 --> 22:24.342
I don't know.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.010
He heard a click,
no visible wires.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.478
If it's a magnet
or vibration trigger,

22:27.480 --> 22:29.013
it would have already gone off.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.715
But is there any way of knowing
what he's standing on?

22:30.717 --> 22:33.351
Sam?

22:33.353 --> 22:36.554
Could be a blast mine,
bounding, frag.

22:36.556 --> 22:39.423
Guys, if he stepped
on one of those...

22:39.425 --> 22:40.891
it's over.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.365
All right, I got uniforms
containing the square.

22:47.367 --> 22:50.000
All communications
is now on channel four.

22:50.002 --> 22:52.370
I'll keep Lou on channel three.

22:52.372 --> 22:53.904
It's important
to keep him calm

22:53.906 --> 22:55.606
and let the rest of
the team know, Winnie.

22:55.608 --> 22:57.007
Copy that.

22:57.009 --> 22:59.043
JULES:
Sarge, I think I have something.

22:59.045 --> 23:02.446
Battery purchase matching
the barcode six days ago.

23:02.448 --> 23:03.881
It's not Rafer.
It's a female.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.483
I got a feeling.

23:05.485 --> 23:07.785
Okay. I need more
than a feeling here, Jules.

23:07.787 --> 23:08.953
Okay, hang on.

23:08.955 --> 23:12.123
11:02 a.m.
Member number 0763827.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.458
Vanessa Kominski.

23:14.460 --> 23:15.960
Nice.
JULES: Wait.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.828
Okay, it's her card,

23:17.830 --> 23:19.096
but it's their daughter.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.464
It's Sara Kominski.

23:20.466 --> 23:21.799
Okay, we're going
to need that photo.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.000
Send it out to everyone, Jules.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.168
On its way.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.808
Hey, Winnie, let's send a team
to the Kominskis'.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.943
See if Sara's there and
I want her parents here, too.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.979
On our way.

23:34.981 --> 23:38.115
If we find Sara, maybe we find
a way out of this for Lou.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.050
Sam, it's getting
a little delicate here.

23:40.052 --> 23:42.186
I'm going to need
both my hands, okay?

23:42.188 --> 23:43.554
Can you talk me through?

23:43.556 --> 23:45.823
He hasn't color coded his wires.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.057
He soldered hundreds
of them together.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.426
The guy has a death wish.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.827
<i> Had</i> a death wish.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.695
Okay...

23:51.697 --> 23:53.697
on the right side of the
resistor, third battery,

23:53.699 --> 23:55.466
I'm looking at a Y-circuit,
all right?

23:55.468 --> 23:57.635
Three wires.
Is one of them marked?

23:57.637 --> 24:00.671
You're looking north?
Yeah.

24:00.673 --> 24:03.641
Okay, east wire of the Y,
it looks like it grounds out.

24:03.643 --> 24:04.809
Yeah?

24:04.811 --> 24:06.577
It doesn't.
That's the one you want.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.479
It's the only one connected
to the active detonator

24:08.481 --> 24:09.747
on the third battery.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.349
Unless that's what he
wants you to think.

24:11.350 --> 24:12.950
You mean, he leaves a phony
schematic lying around?

24:12.952 --> 24:14.785
He might. He didn't look
too surprised to see us.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.087
WORDY:
He may have been
expecting company. Spike?

24:17.089 --> 24:19.657
Doesn't matter.
It's done.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.225
All right.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.527
Bomb needs to be contained
and disposed.

24:23.529 --> 24:26.096
Sam, send me a preview
of that college bomb.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.032
Lou, buddy, I'm on my way.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.971
No one's talking to me.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.640
Who would want to talk to you?

24:36.642 --> 24:38.142
You guys switched channels.

24:38.144 --> 24:41.579
That's because
you're always driving us nuts.

24:41.581 --> 24:43.514
You with the talking,
talking, talking.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.117
I can do it, Spike.

24:47.119 --> 24:48.719
No. We're close.

24:48.721 --> 24:51.088
We're not that close, Spike.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.690
Lou, you take your weight
off that trigger,

24:52.692 --> 24:53.924
it's going to blow.

24:53.926 --> 24:56.794
Isn't the job about risk?

24:56.796 --> 24:58.562
Huh?

24:58.564 --> 25:00.898
That's why we're here, right?

25:00.900 --> 25:02.516
Lou!

25:02.517 --> 25:04.133
LEWIS:
Isn't it about saving lives,
Spike?

25:04.136 --> 25:05.636
Come on.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.671
Come on, Spike.
Talk me through.

25:09.075 --> 25:11.075
Talk me through, Spike.
Come on.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.077
Let him do it, Spike.

25:13.079 --> 25:15.079
You got a kit?

25:15.081 --> 25:17.214
Yeah.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.949
Okay, Lou.

25:18.951 --> 25:21.051
Don't touch
the detonator, okay?

25:21.053 --> 25:23.120
He's got three layers
of countermeasures

25:23.122 --> 25:25.823
and we are going to disable them
in reverse order.

25:28.160 --> 25:31.128
(siren wailing)

25:32.164 --> 25:34.098
Inspector.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.066
There are people in there.
What's going on?

25:36.068 --> 25:37.167
I got every
available uniform here.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.903
What about those guys?

25:38.905 --> 25:42.072
Hey! I need you
to clear that building.

25:42.074 --> 25:44.675
There are live bombs here!

25:44.677 --> 25:47.111
(clamoring)

26:03.996 --> 26:05.663
Yeah, I got it.

26:05.665 --> 26:06.830
SPIKE:
Upper right corner.

26:06.832 --> 26:08.332
See the battery?
Yeah.

26:08.334 --> 26:09.934
Use that as your
orientation point, okay?

26:09.936 --> 26:11.101
Okay.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.236
We're calling that north,
you got it?

26:12.238 --> 26:13.771
Okay, I got it.
You sure?

26:13.773 --> 26:15.139
I got it.
SPIKE: Yeah?

26:15.141 --> 26:16.840
'Cause it wouldn't be the first
time you took a left

26:16.842 --> 26:18.008
when I told you to take a right.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.243
(chuckles)

26:27.787 --> 26:29.086
Eddie, how far are you?

26:29.088 --> 26:31.822
ED:
We're here.

26:31.824 --> 26:34.992
I got her. Sara Kominski.
Light purple sweater.

26:40.366 --> 26:41.999
(siren wailing)

26:42.001 --> 26:44.201
(tires screech)

26:44.203 --> 26:46.070
We're here, buddy.
I can see you.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.171
Okay, let's count them up now.

26:47.173 --> 26:48.205
How many you cut?

26:48.207 --> 26:50.107
Six.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.008
Oh, that's good.
You only got one more, okay?

26:52.011 --> 26:54.244
Just the one.
How you holding up?

26:54.246 --> 26:55.679
Cool as ice.

26:55.681 --> 26:56.714
Yeah?

26:56.716 --> 26:57.848
Yeah.

26:57.850 --> 26:58.949
Three minutes.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.117
You good to go?

27:00.119 --> 27:03.387
Legs a little shaky.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.189
You need a sec?

27:05.191 --> 27:06.757
Is the perimeter cleared?

27:06.758 --> 27:08.324
It's sealed.
The building's evacuated.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.927
We're three minutes away.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.161
Eddie?

27:11.163 --> 27:13.230
We got her, boss.
Don't-Don't move.

27:14.767 --> 27:17.334
Get off me, jackboots.

27:17.336 --> 27:20.237
Sara, that's not
very nice.

27:21.173 --> 27:24.208
Mr. Kominski.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.976
Sara and Rafer
have any history?

27:25.978 --> 27:28.045
There's no way my
daughter is involved.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.213
She bought the batteries

27:29.215 --> 27:30.981
that triggered
these bombs, sir.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.249
She was Rafer's accomplice.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.250
There's a mistake.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.285
No, sir,
there was no mistake.

27:35.287 --> 27:39.390
We hardly see him. How could he
have dragged her into this?

27:39.392 --> 27:42.259
Last time we saw him,
he drove by the office

27:42.261 --> 27:45.262
out of the blue.

27:45.263 --> 27:48.264
<i> About two years ago. He hadn't</i>
<i> seen Sara since she was a kid.</i>

27:48.267 --> 27:49.400
RAFER:
For ten years,
they're killing a river,

27:49.402 --> 27:51.301
poisoning
an entire community.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.970
Yeah, because nobody
does anything.

27:52.972 --> 27:54.872
One night is all it took.

27:54.874 --> 27:57.341
Morning, Rafer.

27:59.145 --> 28:01.011
Morning, Professors.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.714
Just filling in your offspring
here on the good ol' days.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.249
SHELDON:
Sara, don't you have class?

28:05.251 --> 28:06.216
Dad...

28:06.218 --> 28:07.718
Sara.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.460
VANESSA:
<i> That son of a bitch.</i>

28:17.430 --> 28:20.230
Well, Rafer Wilcox took
his own life a half hour ago.

28:20.232 --> 28:22.332
Boss, 60 seconds.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.034
Get behind the truck.
Spike!

28:26.372 --> 28:28.339
Move 'em back.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.307
STAINTON: Building's not clear.
PARKER: What?

28:30.309 --> 28:32.409
We've got kids on the roof
somewhere. We just found them.

28:32.411 --> 28:33.777
Building's not clear.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.345
Come on, Inspector.
Do it fast.

28:35.347 --> 28:38.749
Right side of the relay,
a Y-circuit, three wires.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.250
Yeah.

28:40.252 --> 28:42.019
East wire, east of the Y,

28:42.021 --> 28:43.320
where it splits.
You got it?

28:43.322 --> 28:44.722
(sighs)

28:44.724 --> 28:45.956
That's east.
That's your det wire.

28:45.958 --> 28:47.124
Okay.

28:47.126 --> 28:49.426
No wrong turns, right, buddy?

28:49.428 --> 28:51.495
No wrong turns.

29:01.307 --> 29:02.773
It's done.

29:02.775 --> 29:05.342
(sighs)

29:16.522 --> 29:18.188
Inspector, bomb's defused.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.356
The land mine's not.

29:19.358 --> 29:20.424
VANESSA:
Sara!

29:20.425 --> 29:21.491
SARA:
All right, here it comes.

29:21.494 --> 29:23.894
Is it true?
You and Rafer?
Yeah, it is.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.195
So lock me up.

29:25.197 --> 29:27.064
You know, you weren't so
scared of jail yourselves

29:27.066 --> 29:28.549
when there was
important work to do.

29:28.550 --> 29:30.033
All right, I've
had enough of this.

29:30.035 --> 29:32.302
Land mines, Sara.
Tell me about them.

29:32.304 --> 29:33.470
What? Land mines?

29:33.472 --> 29:35.317
Don't play dumb.

29:35.318 --> 29:37.163
No, I swear, we would
never do land mines.

29:37.164 --> 29:39.009
Property damage only. That's why
we gave advance warning.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.878
Oh-oh, my God. Rafer.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.514
Uh, we set the bombs
last night about 3:00 a.m.,

29:43.516 --> 29:45.182
and then he insisted
that I go home.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.117
ED:
He didn't set those

29:47.118 --> 29:49.051
bombs himself with his
unsteady hands. Come on, Sara.

29:49.054 --> 29:52.556
Land mines are totally safe
to handle until they're armed.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.892
Get her out of here.

29:54.894 --> 29:56.460
SPIKE:
Lou, you feel that trigger
under your foot?

29:56.462 --> 29:57.861
Yeah.

29:57.863 --> 29:59.229
SPIKE:
Okay, what does it feel like,

29:59.231 --> 30:01.064
flat, a spike,
or a bunch of spikes?

30:01.066 --> 30:03.066
It's a bunch of spikes.

30:03.068 --> 30:05.335
Gotcha.
What are you doing?

30:05.337 --> 30:07.337
These mines are plastic--
a metal detector won't work.

30:07.339 --> 30:08.839
I'm going to use a ground
penetrating radar.

30:08.841 --> 30:10.440
Spike, GPR is not...

30:10.442 --> 30:12.242
You got something
better in your backpack?

30:12.244 --> 30:14.978
Spike, it's a land mine.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.480
He is on the trigger.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.115
Now, even if
you make your way...

30:20.019 --> 30:21.351
(switching radio frequency)

30:21.353 --> 30:23.220
SPIKE:
I'm going to get him out.

30:23.222 --> 30:24.922
Spike, stay where you are.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.925
Lou, buddy,
what are you doing?

30:27.927 --> 30:29.510
Hey, Lou, you found us, huh?

30:29.511 --> 30:31.094
You guys got to find a better
hiding place than channel four.

30:31.096 --> 30:33.363
Coming out there, Lou.
No, you can't have

30:33.365 --> 30:34.464
two men downrange, Spike.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.233
Oh, what's the fifth rule, Lou?

30:36.235 --> 30:38.468
Fifth rule is break the rules
when you have to.

30:38.470 --> 30:40.003
He's not wrong.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.006
This job's about what?

30:43.008 --> 30:45.442
Yeah. Saving lives.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.511
(sighs)

31:07.299 --> 31:09.366
Following your footsteps, buddy.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.272
(beeping)

31:48.274 --> 31:50.340
Oh, got one.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.648
How we doing, buddy?

31:59.618 --> 32:01.551
I'm good.

32:01.553 --> 32:05.222
I hope you're taking
advantage of the downtime.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.290
Yeah, I'm just hanging out.

32:06.292 --> 32:07.691
(beeping)

32:07.693 --> 32:09.660
Ah, another one.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.540
(beeping)
There's another one.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.314
(beeping, Spike sighs)

32:30.316 --> 32:32.382
This guy was busy.

32:43.028 --> 32:45.395
Okay, we're clear.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.201
What took you so long, man?

32:51.203 --> 32:52.302
Traffic.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.503
You know how it is.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.706
(helicopter flying overhead)

32:58.344 --> 33:00.344
What are you doing?

33:00.345 --> 33:02.345
I'm going to see if he
booby-trapped the booby trap.

33:02.348 --> 33:04.348
Keep your foot still, okay?

33:04.350 --> 33:06.416
Yeah.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.624
Yep, there it is.

33:14.626 --> 33:15.993
Okay.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.327
Here we go.

33:17.329 --> 33:22.265
Let's see what
we're looking at.

33:24.303 --> 33:25.635
WORDY:
Hey! Hey!

33:25.637 --> 33:27.037
Move them back!

33:27.039 --> 33:29.439
This is still
a contained situation!

33:31.377 --> 33:34.144
Spike, what do you see?

33:34.146 --> 33:36.279
What have we got, Spike?

33:37.249 --> 33:38.415
Spike?

33:41.387 --> 33:43.353
It's a bounding mine.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.758
It's a CR38.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.797
I think you should just
get out of here, Spike.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.732
Doesn't change a thing, man.
Not a single thing.

33:55.734 --> 33:59.369
Spike, we got to
strategize here.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.138
Nothing to strategize.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.340
I'm going to defuse a land mine
and Lou's going to walk away.

34:03.342 --> 34:04.742
Defuse it how?

34:04.743 --> 34:06.143
I'm going to excavate
around the mine

34:06.145 --> 34:07.411
and then I'm going
to render it safe.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.079
Spike...
Shut up.

34:09.081 --> 34:11.448
I'm getting you put of here.
We're all going home today.

34:24.530 --> 34:25.595
(turns off radio)

34:25.597 --> 34:26.730
You've seen these
in the field?

34:26.732 --> 34:28.432
Yeah. They're Russian.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.467
Igniter sets off a
propelling charge,

34:30.469 --> 34:32.369
it fires a mine a
meter in the air.

34:32.371 --> 34:34.471
That ignites
the main charge.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.273
What if we get
a shield out there?

34:36.275 --> 34:39.076
It's not going
to do any good.

34:39.078 --> 34:42.279
CR38 is antitank.

34:42.281 --> 34:44.714
Can Spike defuse it?

34:44.716 --> 34:47.317
Sam?

34:47.319 --> 34:49.286
It's a 38.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.421
Maybe he can re-pin it.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.327
Land mines, man.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.663
You don't mess
with land mines.

34:59.665 --> 35:02.466
It'll take two men
down instead of one.

35:02.468 --> 35:04.301
If anybody can do it,
it's Spike.

35:04.303 --> 35:06.169
If I were Sarge,
I'd give him a direct order.

35:06.171 --> 35:07.704
Well, if I was Spike,

35:07.706 --> 35:09.406
I'd pretend
I didn't hear that order.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.512
Almost there, buddy.

35:15.514 --> 35:16.680
Almost there.

35:16.682 --> 35:19.516
You know what I'm looking for?

35:19.518 --> 35:21.218
A little hole.

35:21.220 --> 35:24.154
These mines,
they come with a safety.

35:24.156 --> 35:25.388
If I...

35:25.390 --> 35:29.326
With a little luck,
I can re-pin the hole.

35:29.328 --> 35:33.163
First rule of tactics:
Never rely on luck.

35:33.165 --> 35:34.364
Did you say something?

35:34.366 --> 35:36.800
Okay, hello.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.435
There you are.

35:38.437 --> 35:39.569
You got it?

35:41.340 --> 35:43.406
PARKER:
Status report. Spike?

35:46.478 --> 35:47.577
He glued it.

35:47.579 --> 35:50.313
He glued the hole.

35:50.315 --> 35:53.617
I can't even touch it.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.364
Uh-uh.

36:07.366 --> 36:08.765
No.

36:08.767 --> 36:11.368
No. Come on.
We gotta think of something.

36:11.370 --> 36:12.435
We dissolve it with acid.

36:12.437 --> 36:14.237
Freeze it with liquid nitrogen?

36:14.239 --> 36:16.506
Only works on electronics.
The mine's mechanical.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.508
PARKER:
Sam?

36:18.509 --> 36:20.509
You got to pull Spike
out of there, boss.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.612
How many shields we
got in the truck?

36:22.614 --> 36:24.614
Won't do any good.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.884
Hold your foot still, okay?

36:27.886 --> 36:29.953
I'm just going to restabilize.

36:32.391 --> 36:33.690
Okay.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.858
I know there's a way.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.326
There's always a way.

36:37.829 --> 36:39.696
Course there is.

36:39.698 --> 36:40.931
Okay, he sealed down
the safety with glue.

36:40.933 --> 36:42.399
I could lock down
the spikes down with glue.

36:42.401 --> 36:45.569
Unless...
You remember in Ocho Rios?

36:45.571 --> 36:46.903
Uncle Rodney,
Bonnie and her kids

36:46.905 --> 36:48.371
took us to that jump-up?

36:48.373 --> 36:50.240
Yeah, yeah.
That was good.

36:50.242 --> 36:51.775
Okay, neodymium magnet.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.126
We'll place it underneath.

36:53.127 --> 36:54.476
We'll lock down
all the moving parts.

36:54.479 --> 36:56.479
Bridget and her friend...

36:56.481 --> 36:57.948
Rum and ginger beer
by the beach.

36:57.950 --> 36:59.883
Lou, you mind?
I'm thinking.

36:59.885 --> 37:02.786
Always feels good
in the ocean, man.

37:02.788 --> 37:05.789
You're rocked by the waves.

37:05.791 --> 37:07.791
Like you're going
full circle, you know?

37:07.793 --> 37:08.992
Back to being a baby again.

37:08.994 --> 37:12.596
Water's just rocking you.

37:12.598 --> 37:14.965
Water.
We'll do a weight transfer.

37:14.967 --> 37:16.866
It probably could work.

37:16.868 --> 37:19.603
We run water into...
into a container.

37:19.605 --> 37:21.738
A gallon of water is what?
Is eight pounds, right?

37:21.740 --> 37:22.906
Spike, you know
what you should do?

37:22.908 --> 37:24.741
What?
You should call
up Bridget.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.409
What are you talking about?

37:26.411 --> 37:27.978
There's a game on
tonight, right?

37:27.980 --> 37:29.779
She loves baseball.
You should call her up.

37:29.781 --> 37:30.981
You should take her out.

37:30.983 --> 37:33.750
We transfer the weight.
It's a good shot.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.685
It's the best shot we...
It's a good shot.

37:35.687 --> 37:40.690
Spike.
I'm not leaving you.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.325
Okay.

37:43.695 --> 37:44.694
Okay. Water.
We'll do it.

37:44.696 --> 37:45.895
Okay.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.497
But first you got to
get the explosives

37:47.499 --> 37:49.399
from the first
bomb out of range.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.300
No, no, no. It's defused.
You cut the detonator.

37:51.303 --> 37:53.536
Spike, the mine goes off, it
triggers the TNT in there

37:53.538 --> 37:54.838
and we bring the building down.

37:56.375 --> 37:57.540
Okay?

37:57.542 --> 37:59.609
We just got to play it safe.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.845
That's a good thought.

38:01.847 --> 38:04.014
I have my moments.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.783
Don't go anywhere.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.459
I'm going to see you
in a bit, okay?

38:33.545 --> 38:34.878
It's not going to work.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.413
You don't know that.

38:36.415 --> 38:39.616
Actually, I think I do
know about that.
Radios off.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.352
Sam, How do you know that?

38:42.354 --> 38:43.553
That's the trigger.
That's his foot.

38:43.555 --> 38:45.689
You're not getting
anything in between there

38:45.691 --> 38:47.124
without a decrease
in pressure.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.558
No offense,
but you know that for sure?

38:48.560 --> 38:49.743
I've dealt with mines
in the field.

38:49.744 --> 38:50.927
So, you know everything
that there is to know.

38:50.929 --> 38:53.396
I didn't say that.
Easy, easy, guys.

38:53.398 --> 38:55.465
Sam, is Spike's plan
going to work?

38:55.467 --> 38:57.500
The chances are not good.
Okay, so you don't know.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.469
I know physics.
Oh, and I don't?

38:59.471 --> 39:00.704
What does that mean?
What I know
is that it is

39:00.706 --> 39:02.472
a long shot at best.
A long shot is still a shot.

39:02.474 --> 39:04.741
Greg, we're talking
about two lives here.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.509
WORDY:
Let's give Spike a chance.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.511
You want to see
two guys get blown up

39:08.513 --> 39:09.646
by giving Spike a chance?

39:09.648 --> 39:11.948
Okay. Spike, Spike,
maybe we should

39:11.950 --> 39:13.917
slow this thing down.
No, no, boss.

39:13.919 --> 39:15.752
There's no time.
PARKER: Spike...

39:15.754 --> 39:16.920
Spike...

39:18.924 --> 39:20.490
I'm coming back
to the truck, okay?

39:20.492 --> 39:21.991
We're going to need
something flat, like a shield.

39:21.993 --> 39:23.360
Somebody grab a shield.

39:23.362 --> 39:24.894
We can't let him go
back out there.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.629
He's made up his mind.

39:26.631 --> 39:28.365
He's emotional. He's panicking.
He is not thinking straight.

39:28.367 --> 39:29.699
And you are?

39:29.701 --> 39:31.935
I'm just... I'm saying
he can't make that decision.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.370
We cannot let him.

39:33.372 --> 39:34.871
He's given us an option.
It's not an option.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.540
Lou's leg is shaking, his
muscles are going to spasm,

39:37.542 --> 39:38.808
and when that happens...
Sam.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.009
You got to make the call.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.378
I'm not going to be the
one to hold him back

39:41.380 --> 39:42.545
from saving a friend.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.481
And I'm not going
to lose them both.

39:44.483 --> 39:45.749
So, what are we going to do,
just wait for Lou to get tired?

39:45.751 --> 39:48.017
What's the option here,
Greg? You tell me.

39:52.424 --> 39:54.491
(phone beeps on)

39:58.730 --> 40:00.797
Dad. Mom there?

40:03.802 --> 40:05.869
Oh, yeah?

40:08.774 --> 40:10.840
No.

40:14.479 --> 40:17.781
I just wanted to say
I love you guys.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.849
No, no.

40:19.851 --> 40:24.020
Everything's good.
I'm just, uh...

40:24.022 --> 40:28.158
I'm just at work.

40:28.160 --> 40:29.759
Just, um...

40:29.761 --> 40:31.761
tell her I called, okay?

40:31.763 --> 40:35.198
Just, um...

40:35.200 --> 40:38.535
tell her I was
thinking about her, okay?

40:38.537 --> 40:39.903
All right.

40:39.905 --> 40:42.639
(phone beeps off)

40:59.991 --> 41:02.091
SPIKE: Why are you all
just standing there? Let's go.

41:02.093 --> 41:04.227
I said we need a shield.
We need water.

41:04.229 --> 41:06.229
Okay? We're going
to do a weight transfer!

41:06.231 --> 41:07.597
Spike?

41:07.599 --> 41:09.732
Yeah, buddy? Lou?!

41:10.702 --> 41:11.835
It's going to be okay.

41:13.638 --> 41:15.705
SPIKE:
Lou?

41:16.942 --> 41:19.843
(explosion booming)

41:19.845 --> 41:22.812
(explosion echoes)

41:22.814 --> 41:24.814
(echo fades)

41:24.816 --> 41:27.884
(no audio)

41:32.657 --> 41:35.725
(gentle theme begins playing)

41:45.537 --> 41:48.137
