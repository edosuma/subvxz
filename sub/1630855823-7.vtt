WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:08.717
THE CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS AND
EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE WORKS OF FICTION

00:12.554 --> 00:14.764
I confirmed
he went into the police station.

00:15.015 --> 00:18.018
But with obstruction of justice
and assaulting a officer,

00:18.226 --> 00:19.310
it won't be easy.

00:20.437 --> 00:22.063
Try asking around more.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.148
Yes, Boss.

00:23.231 --> 00:26.067
Also, find out what Hwang Mingoo
is suspecting us of.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.152
Yes, Boss.

00:33.324 --> 00:34.325
(DOOR CLOSES)

00:39.497 --> 00:40.707
MINGOO: Hey.

00:40.832 --> 00:44.502
So it seems you used to be an athlete...

00:44.586 --> 00:46.046
But you're just a thug.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.256
Forget your place
and cross the line with cops,

00:48.339 --> 00:51.342
-and you could get yourself killed.
-(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

00:53.219 --> 00:54.304
Did you just laugh?

00:55.263 --> 00:59.559
Is the Korean police a joke to you?

00:59.976 --> 01:01.102
All right.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.813
How about I take off my badge
and we go at it, you fuck?

01:03.897 --> 01:06.733
-Calm down, sir.
-Let's do it, motherfucker.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.068
Come on, you bastard!

01:08.151 --> 01:10.028
-Let go.
-Calm down, sir.

01:10.111 --> 01:11.905
You better watch your attitude.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.740
Or you want to go straight to jail?

01:13.823 --> 01:15.075
Well, as you can see,

01:15.575 --> 01:17.577
I'm here to turn myself in.

01:18.703 --> 01:20.997
(SHARP LAUGH) Move. Is that so?

01:21.581 --> 01:23.333
If you came to turn yourself in,

01:23.416 --> 01:27.128
lift your head and list all your crimes.

01:28.880 --> 01:33.635
I forgot my place and crossed the line

01:33.718 --> 01:35.762
by assaulting a civil servant of Korea.

01:35.845 --> 01:36.846
I'm sorry.

01:38.473 --> 01:41.851
I told you to fucking list your crimes,
not apologize.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.315
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.775
Enough with the bullshit.

01:49.818 --> 01:53.404
Now, tell me who those people
in the hotel room were.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.532
You see,

01:55.657 --> 02:00.036
I'm not interested
in fucking nobodies like you, okay?

02:00.787 --> 02:03.748
So tell me who those fuckers were.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.793
The ones who came out of the hotel room
with Jung Gicheul.

02:06.876 --> 02:07.919
Who is this?

02:08.002 --> 02:09.254
Who the fuck are they?

02:09.337 --> 02:10.880
-I don't know.
-Hey.

02:11.422 --> 02:14.175
Stop trying to take the fall
and tell me the truth.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.844
Who are they?

02:15.927 --> 02:18.847
I'm a fucking nobody,
so I don't know anything.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.223
All I know is...

02:20.306 --> 02:22.934
that they're my boss' investors.

02:23.017 --> 02:24.185
That's all.

02:24.269 --> 02:27.355
Come on. Who invests in a thug?

02:27.438 --> 02:30.066
Also, why would investors run away then?

02:30.859 --> 02:32.152
Look, Detective.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.655
It would be strange not to run away

02:35.738 --> 02:38.199
from an approaching cop
who's yelling like crazy.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.243
What the hell did you just say?

02:40.326 --> 02:41.953
Say that again. What?

02:44.330 --> 02:46.207
It seems like you were
quite an athlete too.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.711
Let's be honest.
If you're a former athlete,

02:49.794 --> 02:52.172
you either end up as a thug or a cop.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.256
And?

02:54.799 --> 02:57.343
We're basically the same people.

02:57.427 --> 03:00.054
You were just a little luckier

03:00.138 --> 03:02.807
to be in that position right now.

03:03.683 --> 03:06.895
Come on, Detective. Look at you.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.355
You're acting like a thug now.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.773
Jeez.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.942
You should be ashamed, you asshole.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.903
Seriously, sir. Let go of me.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.446
That's it, you asshole.

03:16.529 --> 03:19.115
You fucking son of a bitch.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.242
Come here, you motherfucker.

03:21.326 --> 03:24.954
-Sir.
-You God damn motherfucker.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.372
-Sir.
-Come here, you fuck.

03:27.248 --> 03:28.416
You motherfucker!

03:28.499 --> 03:29.626
Stop it, sir.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.002
-Stop.
-Let go.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.254
You God damn son of a bitch.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.006
Fucking bastard.

03:35.089 --> 03:37.342
Let go, you bastard!

03:37.425 --> 03:39.219
Come here.

03:39.302 --> 03:43.598
You think you can block
my punches, you fucker?

03:43.681 --> 03:46.684
Fucking bastard!

03:49.020 --> 03:52.649
You're blocking my punches,
you motherfucker?

03:52.732 --> 03:54.317
How dare you?

03:54.400 --> 03:58.029
You damn motherfucker!

03:58.112 --> 04:01.282
-How dare you?
-I said stop!

04:07.121 --> 04:09.707
Let go of me, you bastard! Hey!

04:21.219 --> 04:24.013
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

04:25.932 --> 04:32.522
THE WORST OF EVIL

04:40.613 --> 04:44.033
All right. Let's get back to it.

04:44.951 --> 04:45.952
Hey.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.247
Who were those people?

04:49.330 --> 04:51.332
Fuck, I don't know.

04:52.542 --> 04:57.088
(LAUGHS) God damn it.
You damn son of a bitch.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.675
You still think I'm a joke, don't you?

05:00.758 --> 05:04.345
What? You're going to hit me again?

05:05.847 --> 05:07.765
Go on and hit me.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.350
Just kill me, asshole.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.729
All right. Die, you motherfucker.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.314
What is going on here?

05:34.792 --> 05:38.963
Does this happen often
in Gangnam Police Station?

05:39.047 --> 05:40.465
No, sir.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.759
Absolutely not.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.427
Sir.

05:44.510 --> 05:47.847
May I ask what brought you here
without any prior notice?

05:47.930 --> 05:51.726
Right. I have some information to share
regarding a murder case.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.689
I heard you were
in the middle of an investigation.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.696
Yes, sir. I was investigating
a missing drug dealer

06:03.780 --> 06:05.323
called Manager Cho.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.242
I think this may be the same case.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.206
I don't think I can help an officer
who commits assault though.

06:14.957 --> 06:18.086
I suppose I should report
that assault from moments ago, right?

06:18.795 --> 06:20.880
Please, sir.

06:20.963 --> 06:22.757
We're so sorry for what happened.

06:27.845 --> 06:31.516
I'll make sure
to thoroughly discipline my officers.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.060
So please let it slide just this once.

06:35.937 --> 06:36.938
Hey.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.232
I'll be more careful.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.217
Here.

07:11.013 --> 07:13.516
God damn it.

07:13.599 --> 07:14.684
What happened?

07:15.017 --> 07:18.688
They asked me to sign a paper
saying I wouldn't sue for being hit.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.149
They said if I forgot
about the cop hitting me,

07:21.232 --> 07:22.442
they would free me.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.613
Hey.

07:27.697 --> 07:28.698
Yes?

07:29.031 --> 07:30.616
You know everything now, right?

07:32.785 --> 07:33.786
Know what?

07:33.870 --> 07:35.496
You saw everything in the hotel.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.498
What's Boss doing?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.459
And what's this deal with China?

07:40.084 --> 07:43.337
Why the fuck did he have to
bring you instead of me?

07:49.051 --> 07:50.970
Well, it's drug-related so...

07:51.846 --> 07:53.848
You know my father is a junkie, right?

07:55.016 --> 07:57.351
So it's an area I know well.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.770
I fucking knew it.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.900
Only those three higher-ups are in this.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.027
We should join them too, Chief Seo.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.196
You wanted to make big money.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.115
They have to fucking let me in
to make big money.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.534
We've got to push our way in somehow.

08:14.702 --> 08:15.995
Fuck, if we can't,

08:16.746 --> 08:17.955
we'll push someone out.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.835
Are you serious?

08:22.919 --> 08:25.463
I'm just saying you deserve it.

08:26.130 --> 08:29.133
(SIGHS) You do all the hard work.

08:29.967 --> 08:31.969
Seriously, this is fucking unfair.

08:32.762 --> 08:35.389
You deserve lots of money.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.360
Here.

08:49.445 --> 08:50.446
Well done.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.365
Thank you.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.914
He was really lucky, by the way.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.583
He was getting beaten up by Hwang Mingoo,

09:02.667 --> 09:05.836
and the Chief Prosecutor
just happened to show up then.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.173
Could it be that your lady cop friend

09:09.298 --> 09:12.385
gave him a heads-up?

09:12.760 --> 09:15.346
Hey, are you upset
Seungho got freed or what?

09:15.805 --> 09:19.725
Look. There were detectives
who were undercover in that hotel.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.894
What are you talking about?

09:21.978 --> 09:23.312
Did you see them?

09:23.396 --> 09:26.274
JUNGBAE: It's just my gut feeling.

09:26.357 --> 09:28.276
Your gut feeling?

09:29.235 --> 09:30.278
Jeez.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.698
Well, you've always had good intuitions.

09:33.781 --> 09:36.117
Why didn't you check it yourself then?

09:36.242 --> 09:39.579
I can't just walk up to them
and ask, "Are you a cop?"

09:40.288 --> 09:41.497
You have a point.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.332
Those fuckers always stick out.

09:45.334 --> 09:48.462
Somehow, wherever you go,
there were always civil servants.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.632
Undercover cops, a prosecutor,

09:51.716 --> 09:53.467
and that lady friend of yours.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.553
The cop from the Security Division.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.930
Jungbae.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.015
Yes, sir?

09:59.098 --> 10:00.725
What's so suspicious?

10:01.684 --> 10:02.852
Well, you know.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.980
No one gets off so easily
after hitting a cop.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.524
So are you saying
the cops have Seungho's back?

10:09.650 --> 10:12.028
Well, I'm sure that's not the case,

10:12.111 --> 10:14.030
but something's just off.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.408
Seungho dealt with this on your behalf.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.331
Enough about that.
Let's just enjoy our drinks.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.087
-Jungbae.
-Yes, sir?

10:30.963 --> 10:33.841
This month's ledger seemed
to have a lot of gaps.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.676
You should sort that out.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.638
Yes, Boss. I will.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.038
Jungbae is in charge
of the company's books,

11:04.747 --> 11:06.957
so he's very meticulous.
Hope you understand.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.091
Boss.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.677
How did it go with the Chinese?

11:18.719 --> 11:20.179
We're still stuck.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.558
How about you talk to them?

11:25.685 --> 11:26.686
Pardon?

11:26.769 --> 11:28.688
The Chinese woman seemed to like you.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.357
Why don't you meet her and talk?

11:31.440 --> 11:33.025
HEESUNG: What are you talking about?

11:33.776 --> 11:36.362
I know Seungho's smart
and gets things done,

11:36.445 --> 11:38.406
but it's too early.

11:40.157 --> 11:43.577
Especially when it's something
so important as this.

11:44.161 --> 11:47.331
I think you should do it yourself.

11:48.332 --> 11:51.085
You have to be on the same level
to be able to talk.

11:51.585 --> 11:55.214
Those ungrateful bastards
from China and Japan don't remember

11:57.049 --> 11:59.343
they were able to make
big money thanks to me.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.471
They looked down on me and insulted me.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.850
Those motherfuckers.

12:05.933 --> 12:09.270
Let me take care of this, Boss.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.440
I'll get those bastards who insulted you

12:13.232 --> 12:15.234
and take care of all of them.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.736
(SMIRKS)

12:17.695 --> 12:19.447
Let's talk about this later

12:19.530 --> 12:21.949
when Jungbae is around, okay?

12:22.032 --> 12:24.368
All right. Let's drink.

12:24.452 --> 12:27.079
Kwon Seungho, you did a great job.

12:36.797 --> 12:40.009
And if you're with a drug dealer or not.

12:42.511 --> 12:44.221
HAERYUN: There's nothing you can do
right now.

12:44.513 --> 12:48.684
Your Japanese father is acting
like he's the king.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.105
You don't want to do it?

12:54.398 --> 12:57.067
Then, our deal is over.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.446
(PHONE RINGS)

13:07.036 --> 13:08.037
Hello?

13:11.081 --> 13:12.249
Hey, Euijeong.

13:13.125 --> 13:17.087
LEE AND BODYGUARD

13:17.630 --> 13:20.841
I sent information on their fake passports
to the Chinese police,

13:20.925 --> 13:23.093
so they'll start an investigation too.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.473
Okay, we're almost there.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.810
Now, we know what both Japan
and China are up to.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.978
We can see everything they're up to.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.482
Why don't we just arrest them all now?

13:36.565 --> 13:38.025
Of course, we can't.

13:39.109 --> 13:43.072
What if this woman called Miss Lee
shuts down the drug production factory?

13:43.656 --> 13:47.660
What if the Japanese insist they were
buying eyeglass frames or fake watches?

13:48.744 --> 13:53.123
Then, we'd only be able to charge
Jung Gicheul with murder. That's it.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.961
We have one last step left.

13:59.588 --> 14:02.675
Catching them at the scene
of the deal with evidence.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.344
But the thing is
their trade is about to end.

14:06.428 --> 14:09.765
No way. We must get it going again.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.308
God damn it.

14:11.392 --> 14:15.855
All right.
I'll talk with the Chinese woman.

14:17.398 --> 14:21.318
So I want you to take care
of Choi Jungbae.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.195
He's the one who suspects me the most,

14:23.612 --> 14:25.739
and I have no idea what he'll do about it.

14:27.449 --> 14:30.369

-What?
-What do we do?

36:39.447 --> 36:41.824
Fuck, those damn cops.

36:41.908 --> 36:44.202

36:47.496 --> 36:49.248
Hey, move!

36:49.332 --> 36:50.458
Move!

36:51.083 --> 36:52.877
Move.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.378
Move. Get out.

36:55.129 --> 36:57.965
Get down from there. Turn off the music.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.467
I said turn off the music.

36:59.884 --> 37:00.927
(MUSIC STOPS)

37:01.010 --> 37:04.180
-Come on. Get them fucking moving!
-Move them to one side!

37:05.681 --> 37:07.183
-Hurry and move them!
-Get down here!

37:10.228 --> 37:11.812
This is the police.

37:11.896 --> 37:12.897
GIRL: What are you doing?

37:18.736 --> 37:20.696
It'll be over soon if you cooperate.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.281
Stop that already!

37:23.074 --> 37:25.326
Hey, you rat. Stop right now.

37:25.409 --> 37:26.869
Turn around and stand still.

37:26.953 --> 37:27.954
Get him.

37:29.288 --> 37:30.414
Come here!

37:30.498 --> 37:32.083
-Hold him tight.
-Get off me.

37:33.292 --> 37:35.211
What the fuck are you doing?

37:36.295 --> 37:37.713
Well, what do you think?

37:37.797 --> 37:38.839
Treasure hunting.

37:42.343 --> 37:43.511
There it is.

37:45.054 --> 37:46.055
(SOFTLY) Fuck.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.104
God damn.

38:06.784 --> 38:07.785
Detective Choi.

38:13.332 --> 38:17.253
Man, I envy the life of a celebrity.

38:17.962 --> 38:19.005
Goodness...

38:26.804 --> 38:28.139
Excuse me, sir.

38:28.222 --> 38:29.223
Wake up.

38:29.765 --> 38:31.183
What...

38:31.267 --> 38:32.768
Wake up.

38:36.814 --> 38:39.191
-What the...
-(SHUSHING)

-MAN 2: How dare you...
-MAN 3: Fuck!

38:45.031 --> 38:46.657
-What?
-Get your hands off me.

38:46.741 --> 38:48.117
I said move, you bastard.

38:48.909 --> 38:50.202
God damn it!

38:56.208 --> 38:58.252
-Hey, come on.
-Son of a bitch...

38:59.462 --> 39:01.213
Don't mind us.

39:01.297 --> 39:02.381
Keep thinking.

39:06.469 --> 39:08.971
-What?
-Get a sample of your urine.

39:11.390 --> 39:13.768
Tell me. Who told you about me?

39:13.851 --> 39:17.104
(SHOUTS) Who's the bastard
talking about me?

39:17.438 --> 39:19.190
In the other room over there

39:19.273 --> 39:22.526
is the owner of Tae-ho Rock Cafe,
Choi Jungbae.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.153
You know him.

39:24.570 --> 39:27.073
He went to Yeoksam High too, right?

39:29.408 --> 39:30.409
Goodness.

39:32.495 --> 39:33.788
Sir, we're closed.

39:35.331 --> 39:38.125
If you're not going to talk,
go home and sleep.

39:42.421 --> 39:43.923
What?

39:44.006 --> 39:46.217
You're not a suspect. You're a witness.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.177
So if you have nothing to say, just go.

39:51.889 --> 39:53.641
-Give me a cigarette.
-We don't have any.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.684
Go buy some. You have a lot of money.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.576
What did you tell the cops?

40:13.244 --> 40:16.914
Well, what could I have said? (CHUCKLES)

40:18.874 --> 40:20.376
They mentioned it first.

40:21.293 --> 40:23.921
Rumors say you could buy meth
from Tae-ho Rock Cafe,

40:24.004 --> 40:25.589
and they asked if I knew anything.

40:26.048 --> 40:27.049
And?

40:31.846 --> 40:33.264
I didn't say anything.

40:38.978 --> 40:40.771
They ransacked the club after that.

40:44.316 --> 40:45.526
Wow.

40:48.195 --> 40:49.196
So are you saying...

40:51.031 --> 40:52.700
this happened because of me?

40:56.745 --> 40:57.746
(SCOFFS)

40:58.414 --> 41:00.166
MAN: Move. I need to talk to them.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.126
What the fuck is going on?

41:02.376 --> 41:04.837
Gicheul!

41:04.920 --> 41:07.673
-Choi Jungbae, you fucking bastard.
-What?

41:07.756 --> 41:09.592
How dare you rat on me?

41:09.675 --> 41:11.260
You motherfucker.

41:11.343 --> 41:14.722
How dare you try to fuck up the life
of a fellow graduate, you asshole?

41:14.805 --> 41:17.558
What the fuck are you talking about?
I didn't rat, you fuck!

41:17.641 --> 41:20.269
You told the cops I did drugs,
you motherfucker!

41:20.352 --> 41:22.646
Have you lost your fucking mind,
you meth head?

41:23.105 --> 41:24.940
I didn't fucking rat anybody out!

41:25.024 --> 41:26.734
Yeah. I have lost my mind, you fuck.

41:26.817 --> 41:28.319
If it weren't for my lawyer,

41:28.402 --> 41:31.071
I would've been fucked today, you asshole!

41:32.406 --> 41:33.657
Hey, Gicheul.

41:33.741 --> 41:35.993
Do something about this bastard!

41:38.829 --> 41:40.748
Everyone except Jungbae get out.

41:42.666 --> 41:43.792
Get out!

41:55.721 --> 41:57.473
Now we're alone,

41:58.974 --> 42:00.309
so tell me the truth.

42:05.272 --> 42:09.818
So it wasn't weird
when Kwon Seungho was freed

42:09.902 --> 42:12.363
and it's weird when I'm freed?

42:18.410 --> 42:20.371
I didn't say anything.

42:21.247 --> 42:23.582
Then, why did they just let you go?

42:24.291 --> 42:26.794
Seriously, Gicheul. Stop this.

42:28.045 --> 42:30.839
You know I've never lied to you.

42:31.298 --> 42:32.466
Are you sure?

42:32.550 --> 42:33.926
Gicheul.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.436
It's the second set of books
from your bar.

42:45.437 --> 42:46.438
(RAPS ON PAPERS)

42:47.648 --> 42:48.857
Explain it.

42:52.403 --> 42:53.779
-Jungbae.
-Yes?

42:55.239 --> 42:57.199
Have you been stashing money
behind my back?

42:58.742 --> 43:00.578
Did you run a background check on me?

43:00.661 --> 43:01.745
Did you think...

43:03.706 --> 43:06.959
I wouldn't know you were selling
my stuff behind my back?

43:07.042 --> 43:08.127
Your stuff?

43:08.210 --> 43:09.211
It's our stuff.

43:09.545 --> 43:10.629
What the hell did you say?

43:10.713 --> 43:14.091
Junkies turn their backs on you
when you run out of drugs.

43:14.174 --> 43:17.011
So I made sure we had some
in stock just in case.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.181
You should've told me about it.

43:21.265 --> 43:23.767
As if you would've let me if I told you.

43:24.268 --> 43:25.978
Are you sure that's why?

43:28.022 --> 43:30.941
-Then, bring me the stuff you put aside.
-(SHARP EXHALE)

43:33.944 --> 43:35.446
Bring it to me.

43:38.824 --> 43:42.161
Did you think I wouldn't know
you've already cashed it in?

43:42.244 --> 43:43.495
Did you?

43:53.464 --> 43:58.302
Gather all your money and go somewhere
far away into the country.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.347
And stay out of sight from the cops.

44:22.785 --> 44:23.869
Why?

44:25.245 --> 44:31.710
Is it so wrong that I wanted
to make some money too?

44:33.087 --> 44:34.963
I'm an ambitious man too, you know.

44:36.548 --> 44:39.343
-Why can't I go big time like you?
-(SLAMS DESK)

44:44.890 --> 44:46.642
You can do whatever you like,

44:47.976 --> 44:49.853
but you can't lie to me.

44:51.772 --> 44:53.023
I see.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.544
Seriously, after 20 years?

45:22.886 --> 45:26.181
You're going to kick me out
over something like this? Eh?

45:27.766 --> 45:30.227
I'm the one you need
by your side right now.

45:32.604 --> 45:33.605
Gicheul.

45:35.190 --> 45:39.528
Your judgement is totally off right now.
And I blame that fucking cop, Yu Euijeong.

45:39.611 --> 45:40.612
Am I wrong?

45:41.613 --> 45:42.990
Shut your mouth.

45:44.950 --> 45:46.577
Or I'll kill you.

45:47.995 --> 45:51.790
I'm not the one hanging around
with cops. It's you!

45:52.624 --> 45:55.961
And you keep bringing along Kwon Seungho
because he's close with her!

46:00.841 --> 46:02.926
Weird things keep happening to our gang,

46:03.010 --> 46:04.678
and yet, you never suspected him!

46:06.805 --> 46:10.142
I'm not the one you should kick out!

I understand how you're feeling,
but shouldn't we continue...

48:56.642 --> 48:58.143
the trade that we were doing?

-Yes, sir.

Hi, Haeryun.

49:27.089 --> 49:29.007
You're with Mr. Jung now, right?

49:29.424 --> 49:30.425
Yes.

49:34.930 --> 49:36.974
I was about to call you actually.

49:37.265 --> 49:38.600
I was hoping we could meet

49:38.684 --> 49:41.520
to clear the air
and talk about out future plans.

49:42.104 --> 49:44.439
How can we have a future

49:45.357 --> 49:47.484
when the present seems uncertain?

49:48.026 --> 49:51.446
This whole thing is on us. I apologize.

49:51.530 --> 49:55.283
Don't you usually have
other people apologize for you?

49:55.701 --> 49:57.244
When I have time later,

49:58.370 --> 50:00.831
I'll take the apology
from Seungho personally.

50:01.248 --> 50:02.749
Would that be okay?

50:04.501 --> 50:05.794
Anytime would be fine.

50:06.753 --> 50:08.755
Wouldn't it be better that way, Seungho?

Sure. If you let me know when,
I'll make sure to visit you.

50:39.202 --> 50:43.290
to change her mind.

to let others shine.

And in this way,
Theresa will live on forever.

56:08.365 --> 56:10.658
We humbly beseech you to shower your mercy

56:10.742 --> 56:13.828
upon those who mourn and grieve
for their departed loved ones.

56:13.912 --> 56:16.998
Envelop them in your love and compassion,

56:17.082 --> 56:19.584
and wash away their tears.

56:20.377 --> 56:23.797
As believers
in your life and resurrection,

56:23.880 --> 56:26.299
we affirm that death is not the end,

56:26.383 --> 56:30.011
but the beginning of a new
and everlasting existence.

56:33.264 --> 56:35.600
You didn't have to prepare this.

56:35.683 --> 56:37.560
Of course, we had to.

56:37.644 --> 56:41.356
We've attended church together
for over 20 years.

56:42.565 --> 56:44.484
How's your older brother doing?

56:44.859 --> 56:48.071
He and my son, Changdae,
used to say they were going to the library

56:48.154 --> 56:49.572
and always slacked off together.

56:50.073 --> 56:52.826
(LAUGHS) He's doing well.

56:52.909 --> 56:55.870
You look exactly the same
as when you were in elementary school.

56:56.788 --> 57:00.208
I felt bad I couldn't attend her funeral.

57:00.291 --> 57:02.627
But then, Gicheul asked us

57:02.710 --> 57:04.462
to organize this.

57:10.593 --> 57:12.011
Thank you, ma'am.

57:14.848 --> 57:17.809
You look exactly the same
as when you were in elementary school.

57:19.561 --> 57:21.271
How's your older brother doing?

57:21.855 --> 57:25.066
He and my son, Changdae,
used to say they were going to the library

57:25.150 --> 57:26.651
and always slacked off together.

57:28.111 --> 57:29.779
He's doing well.

57:36.744 --> 57:38.413
(LINE RINGING)

57:38.705 --> 57:39.747
JINPYUNG: Hello?

57:40.165 --> 57:41.541
Hello, this is Jung Gicheul.

57:41.666 --> 57:43.042
JINPYUNG: Hello, Mr. Jung.

57:43.126 --> 57:44.919
What did Jungbae ask you to do?

57:45.295 --> 57:47.297
To check if Yu Euijeong lived in Wonju,

57:47.630 --> 57:49.883
if Kwon Seungho went to the same school,

57:51.050 --> 57:52.385
and if he lived next door.

57:52.927 --> 57:54.387
I want you to check those now.

57:54.512 --> 57:55.513
JINPYUNG: Now?

57:55.597 --> 58:00.101
It seems she never moved to Wonju
and has always lived in Seoul.

58:00.185 --> 58:01.895
JINPYUNG: Yes, Mr. Jung.

58:18.620 --> 58:19.787
Thank you.

58:40.475 --> 58:41.476
Euijeong.

58:42.727 --> 58:44.229
Let's stay one more hour.

58:45.647 --> 58:46.814
To do what?

58:47.565 --> 58:48.942
I just want to quietly...

58:50.652 --> 58:52.654
look at your face for an hour.

58:56.491 --> 58:57.784
Captain Seok just called me

58:58.451 --> 59:00.328
and said they're in a coffee shop now.

59:01.955 --> 59:03.414
Where were they before that?

59:03.498 --> 59:06.125
He said they went to a church,
but I'm not sure.

59:10.088 --> 59:12.090
(PHONE RINGING)

59:15.969 --> 59:17.929
-Hello?
-LEE: Hello, sir. It's me.

59:18.012 --> 59:19.180
Hi, Mr. Lee.

59:19.264 --> 59:21.015
That private detective Cheon came by.

59:22.308 --> 59:24.102
He asked me to check

59:24.185 --> 59:27.021
if former Commissioner Yu Dukhoon
had ever worked in Gangwon.

59:27.855 --> 59:29.816
I said I couldn't do that,

59:29.899 --> 59:33.027
so he said he'd reach out
to the Retired Police Association.

59:33.403 --> 59:35.905
Is Jung Gicheul taking Euijeong hostage...

59:51.212 --> 59:55.425
I'm writing a memoir
on former Commissioner Yu Dukhoon.

59:55.508 --> 59:57.385
And I need a lot of information.

59:57.468 --> 59:59.846
RETIRED POLICE ASSOCIATION

59:59.929 --> 01:00:01.514
My shift's over soon.

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:03.850
Do you need it right now?

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:07.061
I know. You have to go home, right?

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:09.981
By the way, it looks like...

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.860
he has never been...

01:00:14.986 --> 01:00:16.946
to Gangwon Province in his life.

01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:19.991
(LAUGHS)

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.203
This is a big scoop.

01:00:48.227 --> 01:00:50.104
Hello.

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:53.900
Are you Cheon Jinpyung by any chance?

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:54.984
I am.

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:56.110
You know me, right?

01:00:57.445 --> 01:00:59.530
Mr. Jung sent me.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:07.455
Can we talk for a moment?

01:01:07.538 --> 01:01:08.539
Sure.

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:20.510
We could've talked inside
since it's raining.

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:25.431
By the way, what are those documents?

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:28.685
These? Why do you ask?

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:30.937
Well, my boss gave me an errand to run.

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:34.774
I think I should ask your boss first.

01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:38.695
No, wait.

01:01:39.278 --> 01:01:40.405
What are you doing?

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:43.241
I think I should see
those documents first.

01:01:45.576 --> 01:01:48.413
I said these were nothing.

01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:49.497
Damn it!

01:01:58.005 --> 01:01:59.006
God damn it!

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.759
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me the documents.

01:02:02.176 --> 01:02:05.596
Hey, who are you actually?

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.473
I said it's my boss's order!

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.225
Give me the documents now!

01:02:09.308 --> 01:02:10.768
Like fucking hell it's your boss.

01:02:11.477 --> 01:02:13.396
That's bullshit. Look.

01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:16.774
Why is a cop pretending
to be a gangster's lackey?

01:02:19.193 --> 01:02:20.862
Senior Police Officer Park Junmo.

01:02:20.945 --> 01:02:22.196
Yu Dukhoon's son-in-law.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:25.783
What in the world are you guys cooking up?

01:02:38.045 --> 01:02:40.923
Hey, Cheon Jinpyung.
Stop being a lackey for thugs,

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:43.217
or you'll end up rotting in jail.

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:46.929
Look, I'll have your back,

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:48.431
so cooperate with the police.

01:02:49.223 --> 01:02:51.058
"Cooperate"?

01:02:51.142 --> 01:02:53.770
Sure, I'll fucking cooperate.
Here it fucking is.

01:02:56.397 --> 01:02:57.440
That motherfucker.

01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:18.628
You son of a bitch!

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.423
Fuck.

01:03:47.114 --> 01:03:48.157
Fuck!

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:53.412
(SCREAMS)

01:04:22.233 --> 01:04:23.609
(THUNDERCLAP)

01:04:43.462 --> 01:04:44.463
Help me.

01:04:46.465 --> 01:04:47.633
Get the fuck off me.

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:58.352
SENIOR POLICE OFFICER PARK JUNMO

01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:00.646
(GASPS IN ANGUISH)

01:05:06.527 --> 01:05:07.987
Gicheul.

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:09.488
I need to go now.

01:05:13.826 --> 01:05:16.787
I'll see you again. Thanks for today.

01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:45.441
(PHONE RINGING)

01:05:47.568 --> 01:05:48.694
(LINE RINGING)

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.696
AUTOMATED VOICE:
The number you have dialed...
