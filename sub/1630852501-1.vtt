00:06.172 --> 00:10.010
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:17.767 --> 00:19.144
Good morning, princess.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.772
-What's happening?
-Quiet!

00:29.320 --> 00:30.405
Stop! Stop it!

00:31.197 --> 00:32.532
Get up, bastard.

00:33.116 --> 00:34.617
Grab this guy.

00:35.452 --> 00:36.578
What's going on?

00:47.714 --> 00:48.631
No talking.

00:51.259 --> 00:54.262
Welcome to the ceremony, freshmen.

01:03.772 --> 01:04.606
Strip!

01:06.441 --> 01:08.693
A FEW HOURS EARLIER

01:40.266 --> 01:41.559
-Jana, sweetie.
-Mom!

01:44.646 --> 01:48.149
I need you to choose a photo
for the magazine profile.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.069
This one, or this one?

01:51.945 --> 01:53.279
They're identical.

01:55.615 --> 01:56.783
That one.

01:58.159 --> 02:01.079
I'm not doing any more press.
I'm leaving for--

02:01.162 --> 02:06.084
A serious school, to make serious music,

02:06.167 --> 02:08.670
and be taken really, really seriously.

02:10.004 --> 02:10.839
Cut it out, Mom.

02:11.923 --> 02:15.718
I know you want to turn your back
on everything we've built.

02:15.802 --> 02:20.223
-Don't be so dramatic.
-To enroll in Elite Way School.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.724
No one calls it that.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.894
There are so many schools,
but you choose that one.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.231
It only sucked for you because
you were the principal's daughter.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.276
-You can still change your mind.
-But I won't.

02:34.195 --> 02:35.029
Honey,

02:36.156 --> 02:40.493
I understand that you want
to experience being normal.

02:41.077 --> 02:44.539
All I'm saying is
I don't think you'll like it.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.333
No one wants to be normal.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.335
I'll see you downstairs, okay?

02:52.130 --> 02:53.590
Clean up your room.

03:01.222 --> 03:05.518
I'm coming to you live from Mexico,
the country I once called home.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.271
I don't know
when I'll go back to Argentina,

03:08.354 --> 03:11.357
but for now, I'm in DF,
the capital of this--

03:11.441 --> 03:12.609
Mexico City!

03:13.902 --> 03:15.570
It's Mexico City, not DF.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.616
Thanks, Father.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.659
Any other insights before my first day?

03:22.911 --> 03:26.080
I can think of a couple things
about your outfit.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.958
Aren't you tired of acting surprised
every time you see me?

03:29.042 --> 03:30.919
I mean, you only see me once a year.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.338
If I'm lucky, you call on my birthday.

03:35.089 --> 03:38.801
I forgot just once.
Are you still hung up on that?

03:38.885 --> 03:41.596
Do what you want, keep the…

03:41.679 --> 03:42.513
Thank you.

03:43.431 --> 03:44.933
…cheap stuffed animal.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.351
None of this is cheap.

03:46.434 --> 03:49.437
Luckily, I didn't inherit your taste
for animal cruelty.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.065
If you want to inherit my money,

03:52.148 --> 03:54.817
we agreed you'd enroll
in the business program.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.903
Don't you get I want to make music?

03:58.738 --> 04:01.407
Besides, that's why I came here,
not for you.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.451
You have a responsibility to your family.

04:03.534 --> 04:05.328
Really? Like you have with yours?

04:06.579 --> 04:09.791
-Don't provoke me, Luka.
-No, don't you provoke me.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.840
-Are we going?
-The driver will take you.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.467
I have a meeting.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.826
PIANIST DAZZLES CROWD
ON BROOKLYN STAGE

04:48.288 --> 04:51.040
These snobs
wanted me to park on the street.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.921
Only because they don't know you.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.091
They don't realize the caliber
of artist I have here.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.053
Are you sure about this?

05:04.762 --> 05:07.724
I know you got a scholarship
and that's great, but…

05:08.516 --> 05:10.393
Look at those hairstyles.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.355
But if what you want
is to be a real musician,

05:14.439 --> 05:16.941
we can still get you a spot
in the conservatory.

05:17.442 --> 05:21.571
Son, you have the talent
of a young Mozart, not…

05:22.989 --> 05:25.491
-Not Jason Beeper.
-Justin Bieber.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.576
Yeah, him.

05:27.118 --> 05:30.371
-I don't want to be Justin Bieber, Dad.
-That's a relief.

05:30.955 --> 05:33.750
I know what I'm doing.
This is the best place for me.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.462
It's just that these people…

05:38.463 --> 05:40.089
they're not like us.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.091
-I don't want--
-Dad, trust me.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.721
Mom, don't make a scene.
I don't want to make a scene.

05:48.598 --> 05:52.143
Why did we have to walk
all the way here, Guillermo?

05:52.226 --> 05:54.354
Dixon. My name is Dixon, Mom.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.439
Whatever.

05:57.899 --> 06:01.361
Why did you make me
leave the car 18 blocks away?

06:01.444 --> 06:04.155
I told you to stay in the car.
Didn't I, Mom?

06:04.238 --> 06:06.032
Watch your tone, brat.

06:07.325 --> 06:11.204
I can't leave my baby alone
on the first day of class.

06:11.287 --> 06:14.749
-Mom, please.
-I'm going to miss you so much.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.002
-Me too.
-Say it louder.

06:18.086 --> 06:21.130
Me too. I'll miss you too, Mom.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.757
I'll miss you too.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.425
Come on, now.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.260
Don't cry.

06:26.844 --> 06:27.678
Please.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.439
Why don't you ever hug me like that?

06:39.899 --> 06:41.567
-Mom. No.
-Come on.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.486
Seriously, no way.

06:45.613 --> 06:48.741
-What's this?
-Why did you go through my stuff?

06:48.825 --> 06:51.035
Is this how we reward
your daughter's fuck-ups?

06:51.119 --> 06:52.954
Paying for this rich kid school?

06:53.454 --> 06:57.458
I spoke to your principal.
Zero tolerance for your stunts.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.920
-That doesn't matter--
-Are you undermining me?

07:01.003 --> 07:06.717
Why don't you just try to enjoy
the fact that I'll be gone?

07:13.141 --> 07:14.225
Let's go.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.940
-Take care of yourself.
-I will.

07:45.715 --> 07:50.428
Welcome all to the new EWS,
formerly the Elite Way School.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.305
"Welcome, folx."

07:53.139 --> 07:56.434
What? We're in the third decade
of the 21st century.

07:56.517 --> 07:57.351
Yes.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.728
Yes, Mom.

08:02.398 --> 08:03.524
I'll be all right, okay?

08:03.608 --> 08:07.403
<i>You'll face obstacles</i>
<i>that will test your faith.</i>

08:07.487 --> 08:08.321
Sure.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.741
Jesus is at the heart of everything.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.544
I mean, hello. Sorry.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.129
You’re not from here, are you?

08:27.882 --> 08:31.928
Not really. Well, my parents are,
but I'm from California.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.262
Yeah. I don't care.

08:34.305 --> 08:35.139
Come here.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.434
My advice to you is now that you're here,

08:38.518 --> 08:41.229
forget your dream of becoming Mia Colucci.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.981
There's nothing more
cringe-worthy than a fan.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.529
Blink twice if you understand.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.407
You're welcome, princess.

08:53.491 --> 08:54.617
Shall we?

09:20.101 --> 09:21.686
Look who it is.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.396
There she is, look.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.690
No way. Is it really her?

09:26.274 --> 09:29.235
Holy crap, who let her in?

09:30.653 --> 09:34.156
Her grandfather was the principal
and her father is Camilo Cohen.

09:34.865 --> 09:37.451
He produced basically
everything we listen to.

09:38.744 --> 09:42.999
No one told him
his daughter has everything but talent.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.085
You're harsh, Laura.

09:47.837 --> 09:52.341
Congrats! You're part of the most renowned
boarding school in Latin America.

09:52.842 --> 09:56.262
Those in the science, robotics,
and business programs,

09:56.345 --> 09:58.097
this is your territory.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.770
The pencil pushers. No offense.

10:07.732 --> 10:12.236
And the most important part, obviously,
the Musical Excellence Program.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.239
Musical Excellence Program,
also known as MEP.

10:17.491 --> 10:18.534
Why in English?

10:19.660 --> 10:24.624
We like everything better in English here,
it sounds more sophisticated.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.084
You break it, you buy it.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.463
Save your excitement.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.173
Like every year,

10:32.256 --> 10:36.344
half of you will go back home crying
in less than a month.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.441
So tacky.

10:52.318 --> 10:56.030
I mean, not just anyone
can accomplish what they did.

10:56.113 --> 10:58.658
They sold out stadiums
and got tons of gold records.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.243
Sorry, did you think I was talking to you?

11:03.663 --> 11:04.497
My bad.

11:07.416 --> 11:10.795
It's normal to get here
believing you're super talented

11:10.878 --> 11:15.257
only to discover that
what really got you in was nepotism.

11:16.467 --> 11:19.553
But we know that talent
isn't always what sells

11:19.637 --> 11:25.059
and that Spotify bases royalties
on streams, not musical quality, so…

11:34.443 --> 11:37.279
Those of you who get into
the Musical Excellence Program

11:37.363 --> 11:40.157
will play at the most important event
of the semester,

11:40.241 --> 11:42.201
The Battle of the Bands.

11:42.702 --> 11:47.498
The finalists will get to meet
the top names in the industry.

11:48.332 --> 11:50.668
It's a fast pass to stardom.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.504
Take a good look at that stage.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.800
Here your dreams can come true,
or shatter in a split second.

12:01.929 --> 12:02.763
Moving on.

12:46.056 --> 12:47.683
No. Don't stop.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.603
I thought I was alone.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.605
I can be your audience.

12:53.105 --> 12:57.067
I know you're used to being watched
by thousands, Jana Cohen Gandía.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.737
-You know who I am?
-Of course.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.030
I'm from Puebla, not Mars.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.117
-And who are you?
-I'm Esteban.

13:06.702 --> 13:09.288
Okay, Esteban from Puebla, not Mars.

13:09.371 --> 13:12.750
Shall we leave the private concert
for another day?

13:13.334 --> 13:14.168
Sure.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.262
Here you'll find the main offices.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.808
So, are you new?

13:29.642 --> 13:34.230
Obviously, right?
You're new, I’m new, we’re all new.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.357
-Yes. I'm new.
-Cool.

13:38.859 --> 13:39.693
Jana!

13:40.236 --> 13:41.195
Sebas.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.112
Wow.

13:42.738 --> 13:43.572
Jana…

13:53.040 --> 13:54.875
-Sebas…
-What?

13:56.043 --> 13:59.797
Don't be a drag, love. Listen to me.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.716
If the people want Jabas,
we'll give it to them.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.095
-Jabas?
-#Jabas… Jana and Sebas.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.306
Someone said you were here,
my Insta is on fire.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.891
-Really?
-Yeah, come here.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.144
Silence.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.939
-No? Are you sure?
-No.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.607
-Okay, thanks.
-Silence.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.025
Silence, now!

14:21.026 --> 14:23.946
You two, this isn't a night club.
Cut it out.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.407
It stinks of hormones
all the way to my office.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.618
Good, now you can breathe.

14:29.702 --> 14:34.999
The triple rooms have been assigned
in a personal, non-transferable manner.

14:35.666 --> 14:39.044
Curfew is at 9:00 p.m. sharp.
Post-meridiem.

14:39.545 --> 14:43.424
In case any of you don't know the meaning…

14:43.507 --> 14:45.843
-She talks fast.
-Too fast.

14:46.385 --> 14:50.556
…consider me the border, and believe me,
you don't want to cross me.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.474
You can go now.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.477
-I'll come to you.
-To my room?

14:55.561 --> 14:56.812
-Yeah.
-But my roomies…

14:56.896 --> 14:59.773
I don't know. Tell them to do you a solid.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.735
-Sebas, I want to be normal--
-You are.

15:02.818 --> 15:03.986
Sorry to interrupt.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.073
If you're expecting
preferential treatment,

15:08.574 --> 15:10.200
allow me to disappoint you.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.621
Do you see pimples on my face?
A disfigured nose,

15:13.704 --> 15:16.206
or my eyes full of promise
and unfulfilled dreams?

15:16.707 --> 15:17.625
No, right?

15:17.708 --> 15:21.253
That's because I'm not part
of your fan club, Miss Cohen.

15:21.337 --> 15:25.090
Mr. Langarica, I don't care
that your mom is the mayor.

15:25.174 --> 15:29.553
So please, don't test my patience.
Go to your rooms now!

15:31.221 --> 15:33.599
What are you doing?
Can't you see I'm busy?

15:33.682 --> 15:34.767
"I said now."

15:45.444 --> 15:48.781
-Hello.
-Hey, what's up? I'm Andi.

15:48.864 --> 15:51.200
-Hi, I'm--
-Jana Cohen Gandía.

15:55.871 --> 15:58.082
Why am I speaking in English? Sorry.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.960
So you don't speak Spanish?

16:01.043 --> 16:03.629
I do. I'm from California.

16:04.129 --> 16:07.925
-María José. Well, MJ.
-Nice to meet you, MJ.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.438
FROM GRANDPA

16:30.739 --> 16:34.660
-Is that all you brought?
-Yeah. I like traveling light.

16:34.743 --> 16:38.288
-We need a smaller font for the posters--
-Hey, guys.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.708
Here's your room. Say hi.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.211
-Is this a joke?
-No. No joke.

16:44.294 --> 16:47.423
This isn't a hotel, Mr. Colucci.
Go on, make friends.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.174
You don't get it.

16:49.258 --> 16:52.261
My father explicitly requested
a room for me alone.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.264
And I explicitly repeat,
this is not a hotel,

16:55.347 --> 16:58.183
and there are no exceptions
for anyone, okay?

16:58.267 --> 17:01.103
-Don't get on my nerves.
-You can leave now.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.317
What are you looking at?

17:09.153 --> 17:13.782
-Guys, the uniforms!
-No. No way!

17:13.866 --> 17:14.700
Wow!

18:06.251 --> 18:07.503
Welcome, everyone.

18:08.962 --> 18:10.923
Some of you already know me.

18:11.548 --> 18:12.883
For those who don't,

18:13.717 --> 18:15.803
I'm Celina Ferrer, your principal.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.681
I'm so excited to see so many new faces.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.016
We're very excited.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.644
Thanks, Anita.

18:23.727 --> 18:27.815
I’m going to tell you all about
our Musical Excellence Program.

18:27.898 --> 18:28.732
The MEP.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.902
That's what the kids call it. "The MEP."

18:32.778 --> 18:33.695
Thanks, Anita.

18:34.404 --> 18:37.616
If you’re 100% committed to trying out,

18:38.158 --> 18:41.411
you have to sign up today
for the final selection process.

18:41.495 --> 18:44.498
The list will be up on my office door.

18:45.582 --> 18:47.668
Auditions start tomorrow.

18:47.751 --> 18:50.796
This semester's co-captains,
Emilia and Sebas,

18:50.879 --> 18:52.089
will be the judges.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.053
Good luck to you all.

19:10.482 --> 19:11.358
AUDITIONS

19:21.660 --> 19:23.829
-Do you need something?
-Yes, hurry up.

19:23.912 --> 19:24.746
Do I know you?

19:25.706 --> 19:26.540
Unbelievable.

19:27.791 --> 19:28.876
It's Luka.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.546
No way, Luka! I last saw you--

19:32.629 --> 19:34.548
At my aunt's wedding, unfortunately.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.258
You've changed a lot.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.135
Haven't we all?

19:39.595 --> 19:43.015
-I hope you're still not mad--
-No, of course not.

19:43.891 --> 19:47.144
You just tried to out me
with your diversity speech--

19:47.227 --> 19:50.606
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I just wanted to help.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.776
Are you auditioning?
I didn’t know you liked music.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.821
Yeah, but unless you hurry up,
it's going to be hard.

19:59.948 --> 20:03.160
Your Highness, the queen of pop, welcome.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.459
Wow.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.795
We're in the presence of a Colucci,
what an honor.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.674
Please. The honor is all mine.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.470
Excuse me, Ms. Favela.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.149
-Sorry, my bad.
-It's okay.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.734
-Are you going that way?
-Yeah.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.948
Are you going to use
one of your songs to audition?

20:42.241 --> 20:44.284
People always make fun of me for that.

20:44.368 --> 20:47.746
It was a different time in my life,
that's not me anymore.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.706
I don't think they're so bad.

20:50.540 --> 20:54.544
I think they didn't understand
what you were trying to say and do.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.213
Exactly.

20:56.713 --> 21:00.550
People expect me to be
who they want me to be,

21:00.634 --> 21:02.094
or what they think I am.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.304
It's weird, isn't it?

21:05.347 --> 21:08.517
-If you want, we could rehearse.
-Sure.

21:09.184 --> 21:12.396
-Music room at 9:15?
-After curfew?

21:13.355 --> 21:14.189
Yeah.

21:19.319 --> 21:21.280
Okay. Sure.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.448
-Okay. See you later.
-Yes.

21:40.424 --> 21:44.177
Good morning. Put away your phones,
we're about to start.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.388
Please, pay attention.

21:50.392 --> 21:53.145
Would you look at that? He's Colombian!

21:54.438 --> 21:56.356
Careful with your phones and wallets.

21:56.440 --> 22:01.194
Don't even think about stealing here
or we'll get you deported.

22:01.278 --> 22:04.031
Your stupidity
can't match my street smarts.

22:05.115 --> 22:08.577
Just so you know,
most Colombians don't speak like that.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.956
And, yeah, better keep an eye
on your phone and wallet.

22:13.040 --> 22:16.209
Because there are worse things
that can go missing.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.716
Now, if you like,
we can forget about all this.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.927
I always give second chances.

22:26.762 --> 22:27.804
Yeah?

22:27.888 --> 22:31.683
-Or else what, tough guy?
-What's going on?

22:32.768 --> 22:36.063
This skunk-haired kid
wants to steal my stuff.

22:36.146 --> 22:36.980
Really?

22:37.564 --> 22:40.192
Don't be ridiculous.
Sit down, both of you.

22:42.611 --> 22:46.656
We're going to start with cell division,
chromosomes, and--

22:46.740 --> 22:47.741
Miss!

22:49.993 --> 22:50.994
Miss?

22:52.245 --> 22:55.165
-Agosti?
-Is that your last name?

22:55.248 --> 22:56.458
Or is it a question?

22:57.084 --> 22:58.335
Both?

22:59.252 --> 23:02.130
-Are you on your phone?
-What? Of course not.

23:03.215 --> 23:08.178
Okay. This is a good opportunity
to remind you all,

23:08.261 --> 23:12.849
that academic performance
is an essential requirement

23:12.933 --> 23:15.143
in all excellence programs.

23:16.311 --> 23:19.022
So if you fail my class, you're out.

23:20.190 --> 23:22.818
So pay attention, because unfortunately,

23:23.360 --> 23:25.570
I always go by first impressions.

23:32.869 --> 23:33.870
Oh no…

23:54.808 --> 23:55.642
Hi.

23:56.977 --> 23:57.936
Hi, there.

24:00.814 --> 24:01.898
Do you want to sit?

24:21.126 --> 24:23.628
I’ve never been to a school
with boys before…

24:24.838 --> 24:27.632
I've never been to a school with uniforms,

24:27.716 --> 24:30.260
but they say you get used to everything.

24:42.564 --> 24:45.650
Was I not clear, girls? Curfew! Curfew!

24:45.734 --> 24:47.194
Back to your room.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.009
Yo, listen to this part here.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.845
<i>You won't admit it but I know it</i>

25:13.929 --> 25:16.056
<i>You say trap is a "no"</i>

25:16.139 --> 25:17.474
<i>Metalheads dance to my song</i>

25:17.557 --> 25:19.434
<i>Dudes on the street</i>

25:19.518 --> 25:21.436
<i>All the way in Chapinero</i>

25:21.520 --> 25:23.313
<i>In Suba, Los Rosales</i>
<i>All the ghettos</i>

25:23.396 --> 25:24.689
<i>So forget the taboo</i>

25:24.773 --> 25:27.692
<i>I know you're watching me on YouTube</i>

25:30.695 --> 25:33.949
Cool! So you and this guy
are from the same area?

25:34.032 --> 25:36.535
-The very same.
-Do you guys ever shut up?

25:37.994 --> 25:41.289
Hey, bro, remember there's curfew.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.499
Curfew?

25:47.212 --> 25:50.048
-What the hell is his problem?
-Who knows?

25:50.882 --> 25:52.717
I have to go too.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.846
You don't care about curfew either?

25:57.889 --> 25:59.766
I thought you were tougher than that.

26:04.187 --> 26:07.107
Back home, if you don't
respect curfew, you're dead.

26:07.607 --> 26:09.943
We're in rich kid world. Don't worry.

26:10.610 --> 26:12.112
I'll see you later, okay?

27:10.378 --> 27:11.796
Hey. Is Jana here?

27:14.341 --> 27:15.175
No.

27:17.385 --> 27:18.720
I'll look for her. Thanks.

27:47.540 --> 27:49.793
Is this too weird? I’m sorry if it is.

27:49.876 --> 27:52.295
I know it's your song.
I don't want you to think--

27:52.379 --> 27:53.213
No.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.882
Where have you been all this time?

28:00.679 --> 28:01.513
I…

28:03.973 --> 28:09.521
I changed the key on the bridge,
I think it suits your voice better.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.524
I also added this arpeggio to the chorus.

28:22.325 --> 28:23.827
-Wow.
-You like it?

28:23.910 --> 28:24.744
I love it.

28:24.828 --> 28:27.914
-Can I try? Piano's not my strength, but…
-Sure. Sit.

28:31.167 --> 28:34.713
If you want to be seen differently,
you have to do something different.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.381
You're right.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.092
-Go on.
-Let's see.

28:39.175 --> 28:40.135
Start here.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.430
Then here.

29:06.995 --> 29:07.829
Hang on.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.083
That's it, perfect.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.423
EMILIA HAS REQUESTED TO FOLLOW YOU

29:29.476 --> 29:32.145
I had lunch with the cutest guy
in the whole school.

29:32.228 --> 29:35.815
-Esteban.
-Yes! He has the nicest eyes, and…

29:38.610 --> 29:41.362
-I think I love him.
-Yeah, you think.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.490
I'm serious, Andi. I love him!

30:06.387 --> 30:07.931
Good morning, princess.

30:11.184 --> 30:12.644
-What the hell?
-Quiet!

30:28.952 --> 30:30.036
Stop! Stop it!

30:30.703 --> 30:32.038
Get up!

30:32.622 --> 30:33.873
Grab this guy.

30:34.916 --> 30:36.251
What's going on?

30:41.089 --> 30:42.423
-Sorry.
-What is this?

30:42.507 --> 30:43.341
No talking.

30:46.219 --> 30:49.180
Welcome to the ceremony, freshmen.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.646
So you all want to be big stars, huh?

30:56.729 --> 30:59.274
I don't want to be a star. I am a star.

30:59.357 --> 31:01.609
-I'm going to bed.
-Great! A volunteer.

31:02.193 --> 31:04.696
-Let the show begin!
-Sure, let's do it.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.615
What did you say? Shut up.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.325
I said, "nice mask."

31:09.409 --> 31:12.620
-But was the elephant costume taken?
-Bring him here.

31:13.663 --> 31:14.622
I can walk on my own.

31:17.542 --> 31:21.754
-You don't know who I am, do you?
-We know exactly who you are.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.172
Colucci.

31:23.256 --> 31:25.091
That last name is a bit big for you.

31:25.675 --> 31:27.260
Poor rich boy, alone and abandoned.

31:27.343 --> 31:29.220
Do you really think you're talented?

31:30.471 --> 31:32.015
We'll prove otherwise.

31:33.391 --> 31:36.060
Enjoy your last day at school, freshmen.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.480
-Who else thinks they're talented?
-Me!

31:40.148 --> 31:41.107
What are you doing?

31:41.816 --> 31:42.817
Those two.

31:43.568 --> 31:44.652
Damnit.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.112
Anyone else?

31:48.865 --> 31:51.576
After this, you'll be running back home.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.916
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

32:01.294 --> 32:02.337
These two.

32:06.132 --> 32:07.258
And you.

32:10.845 --> 32:13.348
You think you're big shots, huh?
Let's see.

32:13.848 --> 32:17.810
Think you can fill the shoes
of those who came before you?

32:17.894 --> 32:18.937
Just for you.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.815
Where the hell are we supposed
to get changed?

32:23.816 --> 32:25.026
You want a dressing room?

32:26.110 --> 32:29.489
-What is this?
-Time to realize you don't belong here.

32:29.572 --> 32:32.283
Colucci, you're singing backup.

32:33.409 --> 32:36.996
And to round out your awful sound,
the queen of auto-tune,

32:37.080 --> 32:38.623
Jana Cohen Gandía.

32:38.706 --> 32:40.291
See? That was funny.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.711
-We're not your entertainment.
-Look, princess.

32:44.504 --> 32:45.588
Don't touch her.

32:46.089 --> 32:48.216
Or else what, scholarship boy?

32:48.967 --> 32:52.387
Lay a finger on me, I'll get you expelled.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.513
Do you want that?

32:53.596 --> 32:56.307
To risk everything
for a girl you just met?

32:56.391 --> 32:58.935
I don't think you'll last long, anyway.

32:59.018 --> 33:00.395
Strip!

33:00.478 --> 33:03.856
-What the hell are we singing?
-That's the best part.

33:10.405 --> 33:13.408
I've always felt like more of a Roberta.

33:14.283 --> 33:17.203
Selena Quintanilla,
this isn't cool, don't get confused.

33:17.286 --> 33:19.288
Nah, the guy in the skirt is Roberta.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.959
<i>Let's see these pathetic freshmen.</i>

33:24.460 --> 33:26.504
<i>What are you doing with that?</i>

33:26.587 --> 33:28.339
Whatever the fuck I want.

33:30.883 --> 33:32.176
Shut up and play!

33:32.260 --> 33:33.761
Fuck it, I'm leaving!

33:33.845 --> 33:37.015
Seems like Agosti wants us
to tell her mom's boyfriend

33:37.098 --> 33:38.850
how well-behaved she is.

33:38.933 --> 33:42.729
We know who you all are.
We can do terrible things to you.

33:42.812 --> 33:44.439
No one's leaving.

33:44.522 --> 33:47.025
A little sip for courage?

33:48.192 --> 33:49.444
Go on.

33:51.529 --> 33:53.281
Come on! Sing!

33:54.157 --> 33:55.241
Let's go!

34:00.121 --> 34:01.414
Do you know the lyrics?

34:01.497 --> 34:03.750
Of course. Everyone knows this song.

34:03.833 --> 34:04.876
Come on!

34:04.959 --> 34:06.836
What's taking you so long? Go!

34:09.630 --> 34:12.175
All right, then. Let's do this.

34:24.687 --> 34:28.441
<i>While my mind goes wherever you are</i>

34:29.484 --> 34:33.362
<i>My father yells at me again</i>…

34:33.446 --> 34:34.781
You don't belong here.

34:34.864 --> 34:37.492
<i>That I'm wasting my future and his peace</i>

34:37.575 --> 34:39.577
<i>Because of the way I am…</i>

34:39.660 --> 34:42.371
The lack of talent is staggering.

34:44.999 --> 34:47.877
Come on, show them. You've got this.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.172
The new Mia has no future.

34:55.593 --> 34:59.555
<i>Though I hear him</i>
<i>I'm far from here…</i>

34:59.639 --> 35:01.015
There you go.

35:01.099 --> 35:06.813
<i>I close my eyes</i>
<i>And I think of you</i>…

35:20.243 --> 35:21.410
Son of a…

35:23.746 --> 35:24.622
bitch.

35:24.705 --> 35:26.499
Come on, guys!

35:29.877 --> 35:34.882
<i>And I'm rebellious</i>
<i>When I don't follow others</i>

35:34.966 --> 35:36.676
<i>And I'm rebellious</i>…

35:36.759 --> 35:38.219
They're actually into it.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.846
<i>When I love with all my heart</i>

35:39.929 --> 35:44.767
<i>And I'm rebellious</i>
<i>Thinking differently from yesterday</i>

35:44.851 --> 35:49.856
<i>And I'm rebellious</i>
<i>When I choose to risk myself</i>

35:49.939 --> 35:55.069
<i>And I'm rebellious</i>
<i>When I don't follow others</i>

35:55.153 --> 36:00.408
<i>And I'm rebellious</i>
<i>When I love with all my heart…</i>

36:00.491 --> 36:01.909
What are you doing?

36:02.451 --> 36:05.204
<i>When I think differently from yesterday</i>

36:05.288 --> 36:09.876
<i>And I'm rebellious</i>
<i>When I choose to risk myself</i>
