WEBVTT

00:03.937 --> 00:07.141
This is so decadent.

00:07.175 --> 00:10.444
Flying to London
on the redeye
for the weekend.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.613
Well, I am not gonna
go to my grave

00:12.646 --> 00:14.548
without seeing
Billy Elliot the musical.

00:14.582 --> 00:17.318
What is it about a boy
in a tutu

00:17.351 --> 00:20.188
that always brings
a town together?

00:20.221 --> 00:22.823
Oh, excuse me,
can I get a second pillow?

00:22.856 --> 00:24.258
We're only supposed
to give out one.

00:24.292 --> 00:28.062
Ah, boo.

00:28.096 --> 00:32.032
That couldn't have been cuter.
I think I have an extra.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.403
Can I get
an extra one too?

00:35.436 --> 00:36.304
We're out.

00:38.439 --> 00:42.110
Perhaps you could
fold your hair up
behind your head.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.583
Ah, boo.

00:49.617 --> 00:50.584
Gimme that!

00:50.618 --> 00:52.553
Well, what do you expect?

00:52.586 --> 00:54.555
It's an international flight,
and you're dressed

00:54.588 --> 00:57.858
for the International House
of Pancakes.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.194
What? I want
to be comfortable.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.130
All I'm gonna be doing
is eating and sleeping

01:02.163 --> 01:04.498
and farting into
my airplane blanket.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.403
Well, at least today
you have an airplane blanket.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.309
( airplane tone )
Okay.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.611
- I'm gonna go do
a celebrity hunt.
- What?

01:17.645 --> 01:19.580
If there's
a major celebrity onboard,

01:19.613 --> 01:21.149
the plane won't go down.

01:21.182 --> 01:21.782
If there's
a minor celebrity,

01:21.815 --> 01:22.616
it'll definitely go down.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.218
Everybody knows that.

01:26.254 --> 01:28.156
That is ridiculous.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.191
The only way to prevent
a plane from going down

01:30.224 --> 01:32.393
is to pack
your lucky Woodstock.

01:35.163 --> 01:38.266
Oh, uh, this is first class.
You can't come in here.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.433
Oh, no, I'm just trying
to see--

01:39.467 --> 01:40.434
No, I know
what you're doing.

01:40.468 --> 01:41.435
And we're fine.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.404
Paula Abdul is in 2A.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.340
Oh, really?

01:46.374 --> 01:47.408
Couldn't that go either way?

01:50.378 --> 01:51.612
MAN: Excuse me.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.681
Do you have Princess Diaries,
part one?

01:53.714 --> 01:55.216
I don't think
I'll enjoy part two

01:55.249 --> 01:57.685
unless I know
how she became a princess.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.421
Oh, my God.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.324
( theme song )

02:10.764 --> 02:12.933
I totally shouldn't be
doing this

02:12.966 --> 02:14.235
because "A,"
I have a boyfriend,

02:14.268 --> 02:15.903
and "B,"
it's from first class.

02:15.936 --> 02:18.472
But here's a warm cookie.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.241
Oh! Thank you.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.609
Could I also get
a glass of champagne?

02:24.678 --> 02:25.713
You would not believe this.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.748
Leo's in first class.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.518
Leo DiCaprio
is in first class?

02:33.454 --> 02:36.524
No. L Leo. My Leo.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.292
Oh, my God. Leo?

02:38.326 --> 02:39.293
Leo.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.561
I don't know what to do.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.463
I'm--I'm completely
freaked out.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.498
I guess--I guess
I should say hello?

02:44.532 --> 02:46.267
Well, I--

02:46.300 --> 02:48.302
- I can't--Look at me!
- You see?

02:48.336 --> 02:50.671
This is why you should
always dress when flying.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.675
Oh. You know what?
Okay, I'm gonna check
my carry-on.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.176
Maybe I have something.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.948
Grace, Grace, Grace!

03:00.981 --> 03:02.550
It doesn't matter
what you're wearing.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.685
He cares about you,
not how you look.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.255
Are you kidding me?

03:07.288 --> 03:09.690
I know, even as I said it,
I didn't believe it.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.428
KAREN: Oh.

03:14.462 --> 03:15.696
I love tea.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.531
It's so proper.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.500
( both chuckle )

03:19.533 --> 03:23.003
Now, do you take lemon
or peyote in yours?

03:23.036 --> 03:25.473
Lemon, please.

03:25.506 --> 03:26.807
I always forget what you mean

03:26.840 --> 03:30.244
when you invite me over
for high tea.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.747
Karen.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.484
I'm thinking you need
to hire Rosie back.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.752
You've always said
she's your soul mate.

03:38.786 --> 03:42.690
No, I said
she was my soul maid.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.726
And I am not
hiring her back.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.596
I am very happy
with her replacement, Leni.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.230
( footsteps approaching )

03:52.733 --> 03:55.403
Oh, Mum,
I hope you don't mind.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.771
But I took the liberty
of lowering all the shelves

03:57.805 --> 03:59.507
in your medicine closet.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.710
For those days when you
jackknife behind the toilet.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.748
Oh!

04:07.781 --> 04:10.484
You must be
that famous Mr. McFarland!

04:10.518 --> 04:13.821
Oh, you're even more handsome
than I imagined.

04:15.623 --> 04:18.592
You're like
a young Princess Margaret.

04:18.626 --> 04:21.295
Well, it's a pleasure
meeting you.

04:21.329 --> 04:24.432
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too, Leni.

04:24.465 --> 04:27.067
See, Jackie,
isn't she nice?

04:27.100 --> 04:30.371
Yes, but Karen,
Rosie's a mess without you.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.705
Yesterday she actually
considered

04:31.739 --> 04:35.309
going back
to the American Ballet Theatre.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.710
She even started

04:36.744 --> 04:41.615
her binge-purge cycle
just to get back into shape.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.352
Rosario betrayed me.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.886
Now, if you'll excuse me,

04:45.919 --> 04:49.423
I think I may have had
one too many cups of tea.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.492
I'm just going to step
into the other room

04:51.525 --> 04:54.428
and scrape these scorpions
off of my body.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.865
Uh...

04:57.898 --> 05:01.802
Seems like you're really
fond of this Rosario.

05:01.835 --> 05:05.406
I'm sorry, Leni, it's--
it's got nothing to do with you.

05:05.439 --> 05:08.376
It's just that Karen
and Rosie go together.

05:08.409 --> 05:11.579
You know,
like Abbott and Consuelo.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.682
You understand.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.817
Oh, yes, I do.

05:16.850 --> 05:20.688
I mean, friendship is
the most important thing
in the world.

05:20.721 --> 05:24.492
Now, there's something
I'd like you
to understand.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.560
What's that, dear?

05:26.594 --> 05:30.097
I am not losing this job,

05:30.130 --> 05:32.533
you little pole-smoker.

05:32.566 --> 05:36.370
If you say
that woman's name
in this house again,

05:36.404 --> 05:38.606
I will peel you
like a banana.

05:40.608 --> 05:43.110
A what?

05:43.143 --> 05:46.346
A banana.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.450
A what?

05:49.483 --> 05:51.852
I'll cut your junk off.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.626
Oh, banana.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.464
Come on, Grace.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.732
There's only so much
you can accomplish

06:04.765 --> 06:06.567
in an airplane bathroom.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.508
Can you believe
this was still
in the bottom of my bag

06:14.542 --> 06:16.877
from our trip
to Provincetown?

06:16.910 --> 06:18.946
You look amazing.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.415
Nowfeel underdressed.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.451
I guess that's what they mean
by "cabin pressure."

06:26.787 --> 06:28.456
Don't laugh at your own jokes.
It makes you look like a dad.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.691
Right.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.961
Okay.
I can do this.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.764
I'm gonna walk by him,
confident and sexy,

06:36.797 --> 06:38.932
and I'm gonna let him
discover me.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.968
I'm very cute when
I'm caught off-guard.

06:41.001 --> 06:41.969
Here.
Catch me off-guard.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.838
Grace?

06:44.872 --> 06:45.839
( gasps )

06:45.873 --> 06:47.941
( giggles giddily )

06:49.643 --> 06:51.812
Wow.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.482
There is really nothing
authentic about you, is there?

06:56.517 --> 06:57.951
Go on.
You're gonna be great.

07:00.053 --> 07:03.023
I'm sorry,
no coach people allowed.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.792
Uh, yeah, my ex-husband
is up there,

07:04.825 --> 07:06.794
and I just wanna
say a quick hello.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.696
Mm. That's a great story.

07:08.729 --> 07:10.531
Now, why don't you hurry
back to your seat

07:10.564 --> 07:12.666
or you'll miss
your cheese sandwich.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.536
What's going on?

07:15.569 --> 07:16.637
He won't let me in.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.540
Oh, boo.

07:19.573 --> 07:22.710
That is adorable.

07:24.545 --> 07:27.781
And how did you get
those dangerous brown eyes

07:27.815 --> 07:30.518
through security?

07:30.551 --> 07:33.854
Oh, well, I have a license
to carry these.

07:38.592 --> 07:42.830
But my, uh, abs of steel
set off some alarms.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.064
( laughs )

07:44.097 --> 07:45.666
- So can I--
- Just go, blah.

07:52.740 --> 07:55.976
I stood behind Julie Andrews
in a bookstore once.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.578
Between you and me,

07:57.611 --> 08:00.648
she looked a lot more
Victor than Victoria.

08:11.825 --> 08:12.626
( clears throat )

08:14.662 --> 08:15.495
Oh!

08:18.766 --> 08:20.500
Grace?

08:28.175 --> 08:30.978
Wow.
I can't get over this.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.145
How are you?

08:32.179 --> 08:34.281
I'm good, yeah.
Going to Thailand.

08:34.314 --> 08:36.016
Connecting in London.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.619
Oh, that's so funny.
I'm going to London.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.287
Well, of course, hello.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.155
We're on the same plane,
and this plane is going
to London.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.290
Ha ha!

08:43.323 --> 08:45.325
Big relief.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.295
Would not want
to wake up
in Afghanistan.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.697
The war there
is just terrible.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.998
We should not be there.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.332
Not that I don't support
the troops,

08:52.365 --> 08:54.234
I just want them
to come home safely.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.169
Of course, I won't be there
if they come home this weekend

08:56.203 --> 08:56.904
because I'll be in London,
but I guess if they come home

08:56.937 --> 08:59.072
next weekend,
I could be there--

08:59.106 --> 09:01.642
- Grace--
- I just wouldn't know where
they would get off the plane.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.211
It's okay.
I'm nervous too.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.013
You are?

09:07.715 --> 09:11.184
Oh. Hi. Me again.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.154
Any chance I could, um,
move up here with you?

09:14.187 --> 09:16.323
Are you flirting with me
to get a better seat?

09:16.356 --> 09:18.759
( giggles )
Because I should tell you,
I have a boyfriend.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.227
Well, I should tell you

09:20.260 --> 09:21.662
that by the time
this plane lands,

09:21.695 --> 09:23.997
you might have two.

09:26.133 --> 09:29.002
If they let us wear pearls,
I'd be clutching them.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.073
- Come on up.
- Oh, great.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.742
- I'll get my stuff.
- Okay.

09:34.775 --> 09:36.610
What are you doing?

09:36.644 --> 09:37.778
I give you a pillow
and a cookie,

09:37.811 --> 09:40.013
and you flirt
with my boyfriend?

09:41.114 --> 09:43.751
He's your boyfriend?

09:43.784 --> 09:47.354
That's a twist
I did not need.

09:47.387 --> 09:50.157
I got a seat ready
for you, handsome.
Oh.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.225
I see you're up
to your old tricks again.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.794
Big surprise,
you've always had a thing

09:53.827 --> 09:56.029
for Middle Eastern men.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.701
KAREN:
Ninety-eight,

10:00.734 --> 10:03.704
ninety-nine,
one hundred.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.973
( sighs )

10:06.006 --> 10:07.140
Okay.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.283
Karen.

10:16.316 --> 10:19.386
Before you brush
your under-wig,
we need to talk.

10:19.419 --> 10:22.189
Leni's a monster.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.191
Honey, she's just British.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.126
They don't get a lot of sun.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.030
Yesterday she walked
in front of a lamp.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.132
I could see her brain.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.804
- Not that! She threatened me.
- What?

10:36.837 --> 10:40.741
Jackie, I cannot believe you.

10:40.774 --> 10:44.411
You will say anything
to get me to hire Rosie back.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.846
No, no, no, no, no.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.815
This isn't about
hiring Rosie back.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.117
Your new maid threatened me.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.153
She said she'd peel me
like a banana.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.654
A what?

10:56.223 --> 10:57.290
A banana.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.325
A what?

11:00.193 --> 11:02.662
She said she'd cut
my junk off.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.166
( British accent )
Oh, a banana.

11:09.136 --> 11:12.172
All right, I am gonna
get to the bottom
of this right now.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.341
( rings bell )

11:14.374 --> 11:15.809
What the hell
are you doing here?

11:15.843 --> 11:18.078
You call is--
( honks )

11:21.114 --> 11:22.149
Yes, Mum.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.217
Oh--

11:24.251 --> 11:25.318
Leni.

11:25.352 --> 11:29.422
Jack told me
that you threatened

11:29.456 --> 11:31.258
to assault him.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.326
KAREN:
Is that true?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.729
Oh, goodness, no.

11:35.763 --> 11:39.132
I would never lift
a finger to anyone.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.069
Well, I couldn't
even if I wanted to.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.804
During the blitz,
my arms were pinned

11:43.837 --> 11:45.305
under a dead horse
for a week.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.107
Liar!

11:48.942 --> 11:51.311
Jackie, please!

11:51.344 --> 11:54.848
The poor woman
got her finger
stuck in a horse

11:54.882 --> 11:57.217
while she was blitzed.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.754
Boy.

12:00.788 --> 12:03.824
You have really sunk
to a new low.

12:03.857 --> 12:08.395
Lying about this poor,
dear, translucent woman.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.833
Just to get me
to hire Rosie back?

12:12.866 --> 12:13.901
I can't even look
at you.

12:13.934 --> 12:14.935
- But Karen--
- No, I mean it.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.469
I'm gonna take a bath,

12:16.503 --> 12:18.839
and when I come out,
I don't want to see
your face.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.408
Fine! Then I'll take
my face and go!

12:26.379 --> 12:28.348
LEO:
And this was the Congo.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.851
So the spider
that was crawling up my bed

12:30.884 --> 12:32.485
was as big as a dinner plate.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.823
A hairy dinner plate.

12:35.856 --> 12:39.226
Yeah, I've got a couple
of plates like that
under my bed, too.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.129
What did you do?

12:42.162 --> 12:43.897
Well, I--I screamed.
Then he screamed.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.833
Then I threw a book,
he threw a chair.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.268
Things were implied,
insults were hurled.

12:48.301 --> 12:51.138
Finally I just slid
a piece of paper under him
and took him outside.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.239
Though he probably
will tell you

12:52.272 --> 12:54.407
it happened
the other way around.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.376
Wow. You've really grown.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.545
- You used to make me
vacuum them up.
- Yeah, I--

12:58.578 --> 13:00.547
It's not that
I was so afraid of the spider,

13:00.580 --> 13:02.382
it was just the only thing
I could do to get you to vacuum.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.251
( both laugh )
Oh, oh.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.853
Hi.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.989
Hey, um,
can I ask you something?

13:09.022 --> 13:10.190
Mm-hmm.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.959
Are you, um--

13:11.992 --> 13:13.493
Are you still mad at me?

13:15.996 --> 13:17.364
No.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.901
No, I'm not.
I'm really not.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.203
I'm glad.

13:24.872 --> 13:25.973
This is my fault.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.908
I'm gonna make it
my goal

13:27.941 --> 13:29.209
for the rest
of this flight

13:29.242 --> 13:30.944
to--to get you guys
back together.

13:30.978 --> 13:34.214
Because, you know, "A,"
there's obviously love here.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.950
And--and "B," you might be
working my return flight.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.453
So come on, come on.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.390
Sit down
and just work it out.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.225
Okay?

13:45.258 --> 13:47.227
- Can I have a blanket?
- Uh-uh-uh--

13:47.260 --> 13:50.230
You sit, you talk.
I'll get it.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.465
There we go.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.334
Can I get a coffee?

13:54.367 --> 13:56.003
Uh, oh--oh.

13:56.036 --> 13:59.372
No, I'm not actually
a fl-flight--

13:59.406 --> 14:01.341
Okay, who else wants coffee?
'Cause I'm not gonna
make two trips.

14:03.376 --> 14:06.914
Wow, I gotta say,
redeye flight to London,

14:06.947 --> 14:10.317
I wouldn't have expected you
to be all gussied up, you know?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.920
I would've figured you
for sweats.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.057
I guess I've changed.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.596
And so have you.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.066
You just became
the first Jew to say
the word "gussied."

14:26.099 --> 14:29.269
( laughs )

14:32.372 --> 14:36.910
I was--I was--I was scared
that it was gonna be...

14:36.944 --> 14:39.246
weird seeing you.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.613
But you know...

14:40.647 --> 14:42.049
it's not.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.616
I know.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.553
I'm just relieved
that after all this time,

14:46.586 --> 14:48.355
we can just be normal.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.057
I know.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.604
JACK:
Okay, the coast is clear.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.373
Now, you go find Karen

15:06.406 --> 15:08.108
and do
whatever you need to do
to get your job back.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.642
And I'll distract Leni.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.644
Oh, it's a great plan.
Like Ocean's Eleven.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.347
If only I looked like
Julia Roberts.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.416
You don't.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.389
( clears throat )

15:22.422 --> 15:24.357
( rings bell )

15:25.525 --> 15:27.027
Yes, Mum--

15:27.060 --> 15:28.461
Oh, look.

15:28.495 --> 15:31.364
It's the little
harmonica blower.

15:31.398 --> 15:34.101
Ready for his ass-kicking

15:34.134 --> 15:37.337
and right on "shedu"--
time.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.705
You're gonna have
to catch me first.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.040
Scary Poppins!

15:43.076 --> 15:44.377
Excuse me--

15:44.411 --> 15:45.378
Ma'am, please
take your seat

15:45.412 --> 15:48.715
until beverage service
is complete--oh, it's you.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.117
What are you doing?

15:50.150 --> 15:51.351
You know what?
I don't care.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.719
- Give me a white wine.
- $5.00.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.654
Ginger ale.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.457
You have no idea
what I have been through

15:57.490 --> 15:59.659
since I smuggled you
into first class.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.394
I got into a relationship,

16:01.428 --> 16:02.529
I broke up a relationship.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.597
Somehow I became
a flight attendant.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.765
Everybody wants headsets.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.635
And of course,
they only have twenties.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.604
So you better tell me
that you at least had
a decent conversation with Leo.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.173
I slept with him.

16:13.206 --> 16:16.109
My God, you are a gay man.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.779
What does this mean?

16:19.812 --> 16:23.716
It means...
It was nice.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.752
Nice?

16:25.785 --> 16:29.656
Yeah, it was nice
to have one moment
with Leo

16:29.689 --> 16:33.393
that wasn't weird
or complicated
or uncomfortable.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.028
( airplane tone )

16:35.062 --> 16:36.396
Oh, that damn
kosher meal again.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.498
It's not on any
of my lists.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.207
So are you okay?

16:47.240 --> 16:48.208
Yeah.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.478
Yeah. I think I am.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.447
I mean,
I wish I could have

16:54.481 --> 16:55.682
those last few hours
all the time.

16:58.151 --> 17:01.454
But Leo is always
gonna be the guy who's
flying off somewhere.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.523
And that's okay.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.458
As long as I'm not
the one home waitin'.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.660
- Sweetie--
- No, it's good.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.796
It's good.

17:09.829 --> 17:13.833
Most people never get
any closure.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.569
I got hot closure.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.474
Well, I'm happy for you.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.111
You washed your hands, right?

17:28.648 --> 17:29.849
Hello, Miss Karen.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.484
Rosario.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.186
What are you doing here?

17:33.220 --> 17:35.155
I fired you months ago!

17:35.188 --> 17:36.823
And besides,
I didn't do this--

17:36.856 --> 17:39.592
( slide whistle )

17:42.295 --> 17:44.597
God, I miss that sound.

17:46.699 --> 17:49.469
I came to apologize
and to ask for my job back.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.839
Well, I'm sorry.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.541
I have a new maid now.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.544
And she is an elegant,
distinguished woman.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.150
You fire that psycho.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.818
She's not a psycho.

18:05.852 --> 18:08.288
- You listen to me, lady!
- You know what?

18:08.321 --> 18:12.659
I don't have
to listen to you,
you Mexican nesting doll.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.195
- How dare you--
- You waste of space--

18:15.228 --> 18:16.729
( arguing )

18:16.763 --> 18:20.300
I could shove a dust rag
up a baboon's ass,

18:20.333 --> 18:23.303
and he'd do
a better job than you,
you big armadillo!

18:25.605 --> 18:28.241
God, I missed you so much.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.609
I've missed you too, Mami.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.115
Aqua Velva and garlic.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.222
Smells like home.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.290
I shaved.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.496
Okay, nine hours
till Billy Elliot.

18:49.529 --> 18:50.830
That gives us eight hours
to sleep

18:50.863 --> 18:52.865
and one hour to find
a Burger King.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.234
There it is.

18:54.267 --> 18:55.235
Perfect.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.204
LEO: Grace.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.272
Hi.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.208
( British accent )
Hello, Will.
Enjoying your holiday?

19:01.241 --> 19:02.342
That's cute.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.710
( British accent )
Hello, Leo.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.145
What are you doing?
You sound ridiculous.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.381
Okay.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.886
I thought you had
a plane to catch.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.256
Decided not to.
I thought we could
see London together.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.826
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.794
We always said
we were gonna do that.
What do you think?

19:21.828 --> 19:25.832
Um... I--yeah,
I--I'd like that.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.700
Great, I-I'll, um--
I'll change my ticket

19:27.734 --> 19:29.202
and, uh,
I'll leave tomorrow.

19:29.236 --> 19:33.573
Oh. Right, tomorrow.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.745
Wait. You know what?

19:38.778 --> 19:39.812
Don't--don't
change your flight.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.248
Why?

19:41.281 --> 19:44.917
Will and I have a lot planned.

19:44.951 --> 19:48.288
And, um, I just--I just
think it's better this way.

19:48.321 --> 19:52.292
So I-I don't really know
where this leaves us, Grace.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.394
I guess it--

19:54.427 --> 19:56.729
I guess it leaves us
where we were before the flight.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.400
I'm moving on with my life.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.902
And I probably should too.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.874
But thank you.

20:07.907 --> 20:11.678
For a wonderful flight.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.649
Wow, so, uh--
I, uh--

20:16.683 --> 20:18.618
I guess...
this is it, then.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.256
Goodbye, Grace.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.368
At least you got
to say goodbye.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.038
You know what?

20:39.071 --> 20:41.741
I don't think I'll ever
be able to say good-bye.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.916
Oh, Jackie.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.019
Great news, Jackie,

20:53.052 --> 20:54.721
I've got
my little Rosie back.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.490
Now the only problem
is Leni.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.926
Honey, would you be a dear
and fire her for me?

21:03.029 --> 21:05.064
Okay...

21:05.097 --> 21:08.901
but I'm going to need
a heavy, blunt object.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.003
Fine.
Rosie, go with him.
