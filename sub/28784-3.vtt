(Chip snoring)

00:05.000 --> 00:06.770
(alarm clock blaring)

00:10.770 --> 00:12.840
(alarm stops)

00:12.880 --> 00:15.510
(snoring)

00:15.540 --> 00:17.550
*

00:20.180 --> 00:21.950
(sighs)

00:35.900 --> 00:37.870
Hot!

00:42.710 --> 00:44.710
Shit.

01:07.730 --> 01:09.730
*

01:21.080 --> 01:23.010
Oh, gosh.

01:25.810 --> 01:28.820
(clicks tongue)
Sweet.

01:48.270 --> 01:50.270
(sighs)

01:51.710 --> 01:53.680
(line ringing)

01:54.710 --> 01:55.940
TAMMY:
Hello?

01:55.980 --> 01:57.780
Hey. Hey, Tammy.
It's, uh, Chip Baskets.

01:57.810 --> 01:59.080
Uh, the clown?

01:59.110 --> 02:00.350
Oh, Chip.

02:00.380 --> 02:02.520
Did everything go okay
with the condo?

02:02.550 --> 02:06.090
Uh, yeah. Actually, uh,
I'm-I'm here right now.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.120
You don't sound too excited
about it.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.930
No, it's good, it's good.
It's just, you know, um...

02:10.960 --> 02:13.100
It's just an adjustment,
I guess.

02:13.130 --> 02:14.930
You know, it's, uh...

02:14.960 --> 02:16.430
Trying to make it my own.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.030
Well, it is your own.

02:18.070 --> 02:21.870
Look, I'm hosting
a retreat-style workshop

02:21.900 --> 02:23.510
at my place tomorrow.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.610
It's technically
for my more advanced students,

02:25.640 --> 02:27.810
but I think
you'd get a lot out of it.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.140
Why don't you come?

02:29.180 --> 02:31.180
Um...

02:32.750 --> 02:34.650
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, I'll come.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.650
Great. See you tomorrow.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.220
Okay.

02:38.250 --> 02:39.860
Okay, thank-thanks, Tammy.

02:39.890 --> 02:42.490
-Okay.
-Okay, bye. Thank you.

02:45.990 --> 02:48.530
And this is my new kitchen!

02:48.560 --> 02:50.670
Ah! (gasps) I love this.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.740
-So industrial.
-Oh, yes.

02:52.770 --> 02:54.240
-Subzero.
-Oh!

02:54.270 --> 02:56.240
I love it. Oh!

02:56.270 --> 02:58.510
And the backsplash is beautiful.

02:58.540 --> 03:00.740
Oh, all of your accoutrements.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.580
-Oh!
-They're so fantastic.

03:02.610 --> 03:06.010
Well, maybe it'll give you some
inspiration for your kitchen.

03:06.050 --> 03:08.150
-You know, some good ideas.
-Oh. (sighs)

03:08.180 --> 03:09.820
I hope so. You know,

03:09.850 --> 03:12.990
I just don't feel at home
in that new house.

03:13.020 --> 03:15.160
I feel like I'm living
in a stranger's house.

03:15.190 --> 03:16.830
Oh, Christine,
give it some time.

03:16.860 --> 03:17.990
That's going to pass.

03:18.030 --> 03:19.400
-Is it?
-Yes.

03:19.430 --> 03:21.560
Look at you. You've got
all this beauty in here.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.370
It's... (laughs)

03:23.400 --> 03:26.170
-"Bless this mess"?
-MAGGIE (laughs): Oh, yes.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.170
-What is that?
-Oh, well,
I looked all over for it,

03:29.200 --> 03:30.710
and I finally found it at Sears.

03:30.740 --> 03:33.580
You know, you have to have
just the right one.

03:33.610 --> 03:35.580
-What's yours?
-Huh?

03:35.610 --> 03:37.610
-Your kitchen slogan.
-Oh.

03:37.650 --> 03:41.020
-What is a-a kitchen slogan?
-Oh, yeah.

03:41.050 --> 03:43.520
Makes everyone feel at home when
you're in the kitchen.

03:43.550 --> 03:46.590
You know, and it's-it's really
what my cooking's all about.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.020
(both laugh)

03:48.060 --> 03:50.190
I guess, uh...

03:50.230 --> 03:52.600
I guess I don't have one.

03:52.630 --> 03:54.230
Well, that's your problem.

03:54.260 --> 03:56.060
If you don't have
a kitchen slogan,

03:56.100 --> 03:58.730
how are you ever gonna know
what your kitchen's about?

03:58.770 --> 04:01.600
Oh, I guess you're right.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.040
Hmm.

04:03.070 --> 04:05.740
Uh-huh. Right.

04:05.770 --> 04:08.440
Well, I already told you
we don't cover arson,

04:08.480 --> 04:10.210
so it's not my problem.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.810
I'm hanging up now.

04:11.850 --> 04:14.420
Look at you being assertive.

04:14.450 --> 04:17.120
-Those Tammy classes
are really paying off.
-Yeah.

04:17.149 --> 04:19.290
I'm being a real bitch.
It's great.

04:19.320 --> 04:21.560
So, you think I can borrow
your car for tomorrow?

04:21.589 --> 04:23.830
-Oh, tomorrow?
-Yeah, tomorrow.

04:23.860 --> 04:26.500
-I've got an important thing
to do with important people.
-Um...

04:26.530 --> 04:28.230
I don't...

04:28.260 --> 04:29.730
What are you gonna do tomorrow?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.630
-You never do anything.
-Well...

04:31.670 --> 04:33.940
Chip, I'm not, um...

04:33.970 --> 04:35.000
Well, that sounds like a yes.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.740
-Well...
-Thanks, Martha.

04:36.770 --> 04:39.410
Those are also
my apartment keys.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.840
Goddamn it.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.480
What are you looking at, Scott?

04:44.510 --> 04:46.520
*

04:52.790 --> 04:54.760
(doorbell rings)

04:54.790 --> 04:57.630
Chip! I'm so glad you made it.

04:57.660 --> 04:59.360
This is gonna be so good
for you.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.800
Wait till you see.

05:00.830 --> 05:02.500
-Come on in.
-Nice place.

05:02.530 --> 05:04.270
There's some people
I want you to meet.

05:04.300 --> 05:07.270
This is Evan.
He's Merle Haggard's nephew,

05:07.300 --> 05:08.870
which I think is really cool.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.970
-Evan Haggard.
-Nice to meet you.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.340
TAMMY:
And this is Breezy.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.140
She's into crystals.

05:14.180 --> 05:17.050
And, Bart,
I want you to meet Chip.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.550
Bart once played the drums
with Peter Gabriel.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.480
Peter Cetera, but that's okay.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.790
-(chuckles) I'm so sorry.
-Nice to meet you, Mr. Cetera.

05:23.820 --> 05:26.220
-What an honor.
-And this is Shelby,

05:26.250 --> 05:27.720
but you might know her better

05:27.760 --> 05:31.460
-as the Garlic Queen
of Bakersfield.
-Hello.

05:31.490 --> 05:33.300
-Hello. How are you?
-And where is she?
Oh, there she is.

05:33.330 --> 05:34.830
You know Martha.

05:34.860 --> 05:38.070
Chip. You're here?

05:38.100 --> 05:40.840
TAMMY:
Everybody get settled,
make yourselves at home.

05:40.870 --> 05:43.070
We're gonna start in a minute.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.540
Oh, my God,
there's so many things.

05:44.570 --> 05:46.040
It's overwhelming.

05:46.070 --> 05:48.210
"Don't be afraid
of taking whisks."

05:48.240 --> 05:49.750
(laughs)

05:49.780 --> 05:53.880
Right? Is it just me
that thinks that's funny?

05:53.920 --> 05:56.020
Well, it's a big decision,
choosing the-the right sign.

05:56.050 --> 05:58.020
Well, what do most people get?

05:58.050 --> 06:00.890
Oh, well, "wine o'clock"
is very popular.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.660
MRS. BASKETS:
"Wine o'clock"?

06:02.690 --> 06:03.890
Does that sound like me?

06:03.930 --> 06:05.230
Do you drink a lot?

06:05.260 --> 06:06.900
No.

06:06.930 --> 06:09.060
You're the expert,
though, Jordan.

06:09.100 --> 06:10.730
(sighs) Geez.

06:10.770 --> 06:13.270
Look at this.
"Jesus and coffee, amen."

06:13.300 --> 06:14.600
Eh.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.540
What if I bought them all?
Would I get a deal?

06:16.570 --> 06:18.670
Yeah, we could...
we could cut something.

06:18.710 --> 06:20.340
'Cause then
I could just try them out

06:20.380 --> 06:22.550
and then the-the response
I'd get.

06:22.580 --> 06:25.880
Of course, I don't get that kind
of traffic at the house, so...

06:25.910 --> 06:28.350
You know what?
I'm gonna take this one.

06:28.380 --> 06:29.920
I love it.
I'll go get it for you.

06:29.950 --> 06:31.720
Thank you.

06:31.750 --> 06:33.060
(sighs)

06:33.090 --> 06:34.190
(metal clanging)

06:34.220 --> 06:35.220
TAMMY:
Gather in, everyone.

06:35.260 --> 06:36.790
Gather in.

06:39.460 --> 06:41.530
I just don't understand
why you didn't say something

06:41.560 --> 06:43.370
-when I came to borrow your car.
-TAMMY: Come on in.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.800
Because I didn't want you asking

06:44.830 --> 06:46.900
-if you could come with me.
-(Chip sighs)

06:46.940 --> 06:49.470
-Well, that's why I didn't
tell you what I was doing.
-TAMMY: Feeling okay?

06:49.510 --> 06:51.910
Look, Chip,
maybe you could just leave.

06:51.940 --> 06:54.140
I mean, I'm glad
that Tammy helped you

06:54.180 --> 06:55.580
with the condo and everything,

06:55.610 --> 06:58.780
but this is kind of my thing.

06:58.810 --> 07:02.720
Also, that Uber here
cost me almost $300.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.220
Why don't you take the bus?

07:04.250 --> 07:06.220
You take the bus next time.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.160
(metal clanging)

07:08.190 --> 07:10.090
TAMMY:
Chip,

07:10.130 --> 07:12.060
since this is your first time,

07:12.090 --> 07:15.000
why don't you tell us something
about yourself.

07:15.030 --> 07:17.000
CHIP:
Um...

07:17.030 --> 07:18.600
(clicking tongue)

07:18.630 --> 07:20.970
Uh... I don't like cats.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.970
TAMMY:
Okay. Let's move on.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.910
Martha, what about you?

07:24.940 --> 07:28.810
Well, Chip stole mine. Um...

07:28.840 --> 07:31.650
Okay, um,
I'm more of a dog person.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.320
Okay. Let's move on.
We're gonna have

07:34.350 --> 07:36.590
five minutes...

07:36.620 --> 07:38.750
of quiet.

07:38.790 --> 07:40.390
(whispers):
This is gonna be a long weekend.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.760
-Okay, keep your eyes
closed, Ken.
-My eyes are closed.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.160
-Here comes the surprise.
-This is so exciting, Christine.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.360
-Keep them closed.
-All right.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.430
Okay, open your eyes.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.300
(sighs)

07:53.340 --> 07:55.500
-MRS. BASKETS: Do you love it?
-I don't get it.

07:55.540 --> 07:58.040
What... what are head tomatoes?

07:58.070 --> 08:01.380
No, no. It's a thinker.
It's like me.

08:01.410 --> 08:04.050
-I'm sorry, I just,
I-I don't get it.
-Okay.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.350
Look, "I love...

08:06.380 --> 08:08.820
"you from my head

08:08.850 --> 08:11.550
to-may-toes."

08:12.820 --> 08:14.990
"I love you
from my head to my toes."

08:15.020 --> 08:16.020
Oh.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.690
Oh, I get it. Yeah.

08:17.730 --> 08:20.860
-It's very funny.
-Oh, it is not. You hate it.

08:20.900 --> 08:24.000
No, I mean,
not every kitchen has a slogan.

08:24.030 --> 08:26.540
Maybe we're just not
kitchen slogan people.

08:26.570 --> 08:28.570
What are we, blank walls people?

08:28.600 --> 08:30.640
Baby, it's no big deal.

08:30.670 --> 08:32.510
Well, this place
doesn't even feel like me.

08:32.539 --> 08:34.980
The cupboards don't.
The floors don't.

08:35.010 --> 08:37.049
This big island here.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.650
The stove.

08:38.679 --> 08:41.419
The knobs are European.
They turn to the left.

08:41.450 --> 08:43.090
They don't even turn
to the right to turn it on.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.520
-Honey...
-It's...

08:44.550 --> 08:46.390
Honey, listen to me now.

08:46.420 --> 08:48.760
-This is our home.
-Yeah.

08:48.790 --> 08:50.760
We're gonna clean up this mess,

08:50.790 --> 08:53.160
and we're gonna make it
just beautiful.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.730
-We'll paint it just
in the colors that you like.
-(exhales)

08:55.760 --> 08:59.200
We'll get some of your old stuff
to make it feel like your own.

08:59.230 --> 09:02.340
And we'll-we'll dig out
your old fridge magnets.

09:02.370 --> 09:03.740
(whispers):
Fridge magnets.

09:03.770 --> 09:05.270
Did you pack those?

09:06.310 --> 09:08.040
No. Was I supposed to?

09:08.080 --> 09:10.680
What box are those in?

09:10.710 --> 09:12.410
I had a little taco magnet.

09:12.450 --> 09:15.450
I had a little doughnut magnet
with a bite out of it.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.920
And then
Chip made me a half moon

09:17.950 --> 09:20.520
that was full of macaroni,
and it was really good.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.190
I've had it on my fridge
for 40 years.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.130
And then I got a collectible one

09:25.160 --> 09:26.760
from the bank
about the bicentennial.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.460
-That only happens every...
-I'm sorry, Christine,

09:28.500 --> 09:30.730
I just don't see them anywhere.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.400
We've unpacked
the kitchen boxes.

09:32.430 --> 09:34.640
-(sighs)
-What do you want to do?

09:36.070 --> 09:38.270
I want to find 'em.

09:38.310 --> 09:40.210
*

09:40.240 --> 09:41.610
(knocking)

09:42.650 --> 09:44.580
Can I help you?

09:44.610 --> 09:46.780
Remember me?
Christine Baskets?

09:46.820 --> 09:48.320
Sure.

09:48.350 --> 09:50.590
I used to own this house.

09:51.590 --> 09:52.720
I really just don't understand

09:52.760 --> 09:54.290
the point of this exercise.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.060
Well, we're just gathering food

09:56.090 --> 09:58.790
so that we can all participate
in nourishing each other.

09:58.830 --> 10:01.930
It just seems like we're all
working for free, that's all.

10:01.960 --> 10:05.400
Wait a minute, Tammy's
not charging you to be here?

10:05.430 --> 10:07.240
No. She charging you?

10:07.270 --> 10:09.270
(exhales)
You know what, Chip?

10:09.300 --> 10:11.910
I've been doing this program
for, like, four months,

10:11.940 --> 10:14.240
and I have a lot
of seniority over you,

10:14.280 --> 10:17.080
so I'm just gonna tell you
right now to shut up

10:17.110 --> 10:18.480
and pick your stupid tomatoes.

10:18.510 --> 10:20.820
-Good God!
-Everything okay here?

10:20.850 --> 10:22.820
-(Chip sighs)
-Sorry, Tammy,

10:22.850 --> 10:26.020
it's just these newbies bug
the shit out of me sometimes.

10:26.050 --> 10:28.360
Tammy, I'm just not real sure
how this is...

10:28.390 --> 10:30.190
how this is helping me.

10:30.230 --> 10:34.460
Here. Why don't you and I just
go for a little walk together,

10:34.500 --> 10:36.530
just the two of us, okay?

10:36.560 --> 10:38.200
-Let's go.
-(Martha sighs)

10:38.230 --> 10:40.840
Wai... Um, Tammy, wai...

10:40.870 --> 10:43.610
I'm sorry, but I've
been working really hard,

10:43.640 --> 10:46.710
and I've been looking forward
to this retreat for weeks,

10:46.740 --> 10:49.610
and then Chip just shows up
last minute?

10:49.640 --> 10:52.380
Martha...

10:52.410 --> 10:56.850
dear, why don't you just focus
on Martha right now.

10:57.850 --> 11:00.060
Focus.

11:00.090 --> 11:01.460
(Martha sighs)

11:01.490 --> 11:03.460
TAMMY:
Come on, Chip.

11:03.490 --> 11:05.330
MARTHA:
Damn it.

11:07.830 --> 11:08.960
Ow.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.270
God...

11:11.670 --> 11:14.000
-Sorry.
-TAMMY: You think this is all

11:14.040 --> 11:16.670
pretty silly, don't you?

11:16.710 --> 11:18.570
-No.
-(laughs)

11:18.610 --> 11:21.640
It's okay,
you don't have to pretend.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.810
I guess it... it wasn't
what I was expecting.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.480
And what were you
expecting, exactly?

11:27.520 --> 11:30.390
To be able to change everything
that's wrong in your life

11:30.420 --> 11:31.990
in one day?

11:32.020 --> 11:34.090
This is a daily practice, Chip.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.260
That's the whole point.

11:36.290 --> 11:39.560
There's no magic answer.
I know this seems

11:39.590 --> 11:41.930
-(sighs heavily)
-a little hippy-dippy to you,

11:41.960 --> 11:45.230
but that's what
most people respond to.

11:45.270 --> 11:47.370
You're different.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.070
I am?

11:49.100 --> 11:52.880
Yes. You have a deeply critical
sensibility about you.

11:52.910 --> 11:55.110
And that's a good thing.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.380
MRS. BASKETS:
You know, they were

11:58.410 --> 12:00.220
right here, the magnets.

12:00.250 --> 12:01.950
(gasps)
New backsplash, huh?

12:01.980 --> 12:04.020
-Mm-hmm.
-Wow.

12:04.050 --> 12:06.790
Not my taste, but... okay.

12:06.820 --> 12:09.390
(gasps)
My microwave! I miss it.

12:09.420 --> 12:11.690
-Do you use it? Do you love it?
-We...

12:11.730 --> 12:13.630
we don't really use it.

12:13.660 --> 12:16.560
Yeah, this is
such a great... kitchen.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.400
I really miss it.

12:18.430 --> 12:20.770
-My kitchen's a mess.
-You... you know,

12:20.800 --> 12:23.310
I'm pretty sure the fridge
was just blank when we moved in.

12:23.340 --> 12:25.870
Yeah, we would have noticed
the magnets.

12:25.910 --> 12:27.440
What about the kids?

12:27.480 --> 12:29.480
Maybe they got their hands
on them, you know,

12:29.510 --> 12:33.220
and squirreled them away
in some of their hiding places.

12:33.250 --> 12:36.320
No, they're actually, you know,
more into video games.

12:36.350 --> 12:37.820
-Well...
-WOMAN: You know,

12:37.850 --> 12:40.460
-why don't you just...
buy some new magnets?
-Yeah.

12:40.490 --> 12:43.790
What? Why don't you get
some new kids, if you lost them?

12:43.830 --> 12:45.230
(exhales)

12:45.260 --> 12:47.760
(Mrs. Baskets groans loudly
in frustration)

12:48.800 --> 12:50.770
The move.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.070
(whispers):
I'm so stressed out.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.240
-Yeah, no, we...
we totally get it.
-Mm-hmm.

12:55.270 --> 12:58.640
Those magnets really mean
a lot to me. I'm sorry.

12:58.670 --> 13:02.340
I'm very sorry to insult your...
(whispers): children.

13:02.380 --> 13:06.310
-MAN: It's okay.
-You mind if I poke around
in the garage a little bit?

13:06.350 --> 13:07.950
I still think
they might be here.

13:07.980 --> 13:09.480
Um...

13:11.190 --> 13:13.420
(birds chirping)

13:13.460 --> 13:15.690
I wasn't always like this,
you know.

13:16.990 --> 13:20.460
When my husband died...

13:20.500 --> 13:24.000
it wasn't until I was
in a car wreck

13:24.030 --> 13:27.940
that I realized how terrified
I was of being alive.

13:27.970 --> 13:30.140
What I'm talking about is that

13:30.170 --> 13:34.380
when people are having trouble
moving forward in their life,

13:34.410 --> 13:35.840
it's usually because
they're holding on

13:35.880 --> 13:37.280
to some kind of trauma.

13:37.310 --> 13:41.150
There's a reason that
you're here today, Chip.

13:41.180 --> 13:43.020
There's a reason that
you're having problems

13:43.050 --> 13:45.790
moving forward in life.

13:45.820 --> 13:47.560
Who are you afraid of becoming?

13:47.590 --> 13:50.730
Um...

13:50.760 --> 13:53.800
my dad...

13:53.830 --> 13:58.370
was a nice, normal...

13:58.400 --> 14:01.000
man, but he just--

14:01.040 --> 14:03.010
he wasn't happy.

14:04.570 --> 14:06.370
Is he still alive?

14:06.410 --> 14:09.410
No, he...

14:09.440 --> 14:12.080
(exhales)
He died when I was young.

14:12.110 --> 14:13.720
How?

14:13.750 --> 14:16.520
The bridge, and he, um...

14:19.550 --> 14:21.520
(whispers):
...jumped off the bridge.

14:21.560 --> 14:25.060
Look, Chip, we're all afraid
of becoming our parents,

14:25.090 --> 14:27.560
but I have a secret for you.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.530
-You're not your father.
-(sighs)

14:30.570 --> 14:34.170
I am not my mother.
(chuckles)

14:34.200 --> 14:36.400
You don't have to be afraid
of growing up.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.170
It's not gonna kill you.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.410
-(chuckles softly)
-Look.

14:41.210 --> 14:42.240
Give me your hand.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.580
I want you to keep this rock.

14:44.610 --> 14:48.580
I want you to hold on to this
any time you're feeling scared.

14:48.620 --> 14:50.120
I want you to put
all of your energy

14:50.150 --> 14:52.750
into this rock;
let it be your ballast.

14:52.790 --> 14:55.790
Let it remind you that you're
not afraid of growing up,

14:55.820 --> 14:57.790
that you're a mature adult.

14:57.830 --> 15:00.130
And then I want you to
go back to my house

15:00.160 --> 15:02.300
with your head held high,

15:02.330 --> 15:05.370
knowing that you are
an important adult

15:05.400 --> 15:07.470
with an impressive life.

15:09.470 --> 15:10.640
This is really neat.

15:10.670 --> 15:13.280
What is this made out of?

15:13.310 --> 15:15.240
It's... just a rock.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.410
Is it a crystal or...?

15:17.450 --> 15:20.150
It's a metaphor.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.150
Just drop it.

15:22.180 --> 15:23.320
It's in the pool.

15:23.350 --> 15:25.920
(laughing)

15:25.950 --> 15:28.260
You didn't mean "drop the rock"?
You mean...

15:28.290 --> 15:29.660
No, I meant...

15:29.690 --> 15:31.290
it's a metaphor.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.230
Learn from it.

15:33.260 --> 15:35.630
I'll see you in a bit.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.670
*

15:44.170 --> 15:45.570
(insects trilling)

15:45.610 --> 15:47.080
I found a sock.

15:47.110 --> 15:48.240
Oh.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.810
Well, we're not looking
for socks, honey.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.810
We're looking for magnets.

15:51.850 --> 15:55.680
Hey, you girls didn't hide
my magnets, did you?

15:55.720 --> 15:58.290
You know, there was
a Garfield one.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.360
I would imagine
you'd like to have one of those.

16:00.390 --> 16:01.860
We don't know who that is.

16:01.890 --> 16:05.360
What? They don't know
who Garfield is!

16:05.390 --> 16:06.860
Okay.

16:06.890 --> 16:09.260
Uh, so, girls,
it's time to take a bath.

16:09.300 --> 16:10.870
-(gasps)
-KID: But we haven't
found them yet.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.830
I don't think we're gonna
find them tonight, okay?

16:12.870 --> 16:15.270
Not with that attitude.
(laughs)

16:15.300 --> 16:16.870
Okay, kids. Come on.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.710
-Let's go.
-Thanks, girls.

16:18.740 --> 16:20.180
Enjoy that tub.
I love that tub.

16:20.210 --> 16:22.180
Okay, kids, come on.
Go with Mom.

16:22.210 --> 16:24.610
-Cute kids.
-Thanks.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.280
You know, I was thinking--
maybe we could pull

16:27.320 --> 16:30.320
that old stove out and see
if the magnets are behind there.

16:30.350 --> 16:32.720
Look, ma'am, I'm sorry,

16:32.750 --> 16:34.160
uh, about your magnets,

16:34.190 --> 16:36.560
but they're obviously not here.

16:36.590 --> 16:38.660
So I need you to leave.

16:38.690 --> 16:41.400
Oh.

16:41.430 --> 16:43.830
Well...

16:43.870 --> 16:46.230
Okay.

16:46.270 --> 16:47.540
(sighs)

16:47.570 --> 16:50.000
Thanks for letting me look.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.240
Enjoy that microwave.

16:52.270 --> 16:54.710
It's a beauty.

16:56.780 --> 16:58.010
So, Chip,

16:58.050 --> 16:59.510
you said you, uh,
run a business.

16:59.550 --> 17:03.090
Yes, I am owner-operator
of a rodeo.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.750
Uh, Baskets Family Rodeo.

17:04.790 --> 17:05.849
EVAN:
Rodeo.

17:05.890 --> 17:06.849
-Wow.
-Mm.

17:06.890 --> 17:07.890
That's very impressive.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.390
That must be a lot to handle.

17:09.420 --> 17:12.490
It's-- you know,
it's-it's very rewarding work.

17:12.530 --> 17:14.430
SHELBY:
Here, try this.

17:15.260 --> 17:16.730
(chuckles)

17:16.760 --> 17:19.069
-That is very flavorful.
-It's mostly garlic.

17:19.099 --> 17:21.569
-It's very good for the heart.
-Mm.

17:21.599 --> 17:23.569
Hey, Martha, can you see
if there's some salt over there

17:23.609 --> 17:24.770
-and bring it over?
-Why?

17:24.810 --> 17:26.040
Are your legs broken?

17:26.069 --> 17:27.579
Get your own salt.

17:27.609 --> 17:29.410
(quietly):
Martha, look,

17:29.440 --> 17:31.250
I know you're trying to be
a little bit more assertive,

17:31.280 --> 17:32.550
but this is a little much.

17:32.580 --> 17:33.620
Oh, is it?

17:33.650 --> 17:34.620
I guess you would know,

17:34.650 --> 17:36.380
since you've taken over
the retreat.

17:36.420 --> 17:37.790
Martha.

17:37.820 --> 17:40.050
-(scoffs)
-Sorry. I'm hammered.

17:41.090 --> 17:42.920
Oh, I was gonna put some
of these carrots

17:42.960 --> 17:44.090
in with the roast.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.760
Anybody here a vegetarian?

17:45.790 --> 17:47.460
I am. Yeah.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.360
Oh, yeah?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.760
Vegan, actually. Yeah.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.400
You're not vegan.

17:51.430 --> 17:52.430
Yeah, I am.

17:52.470 --> 17:54.140
MARTHA:
I've seen you eat raw beef.

17:54.170 --> 17:56.770
That-- Yeah.
Maybe from a long time ago,

17:56.800 --> 17:58.610
but... (stammers)
people change.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.240
Be quiet, Martha.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.310
How are we all doing in here?

18:02.340 --> 18:04.210
We're fine, Tammy.
Everything's fine.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.310
I think Martha might have had
a little too much zinfandel.

18:06.350 --> 18:09.120
Hey. Keep my name out
of your mouth, Sheryl.

18:09.150 --> 18:10.720
It's Shelby.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.590
Who gives a shit?

18:12.620 --> 18:16.590
Well, why don't
we all gather together

18:16.620 --> 18:18.990
around the table
and do a thankfulness circle

18:19.030 --> 18:20.230
before we eat?

18:20.260 --> 18:21.300
Wouldn't that be good?

18:21.330 --> 18:22.730
I'm not done basting.

18:22.760 --> 18:26.000
I think the roast
looks just fine, Martha.

18:26.030 --> 18:27.770
How 'bout a little water, honey?

18:27.800 --> 18:29.240
-I'm fine.
-You know, Martha,

18:29.270 --> 18:30.740
-I can handle it.
-Fine.

18:30.770 --> 18:31.910
(slurring):
You don't want it basted?

18:31.940 --> 18:33.580
-BART: Whoa!
-CHIP: Martha.

18:33.610 --> 18:35.080
-TAMMY: Oh. Be careful.
It's hot.
-(scoffs)

18:35.110 --> 18:36.510
-Ow, ow, ow, ow.
-It's really hot.

18:36.540 --> 18:37.780
-Watch out.
-BART: Oh! Hot!

18:37.810 --> 18:38.950
-Hot, hot, hot!
-Careful!

18:38.980 --> 18:40.750
(hisses)

18:40.780 --> 18:41.980
It's not that hot.

18:42.020 --> 18:43.190
That guy's a pussy.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.750
TAMMY:
Martha!

18:46.790 --> 18:48.790
I think you've had enough.

18:49.860 --> 18:52.260
I'm sorry, Martha, but...

18:52.290 --> 18:54.730
it's best that you leave.

18:56.060 --> 18:58.000
Okay. Fine.

18:59.030 --> 19:01.800
I guess I'll call an Uber.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.810
Watch out where you step.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.810
-There are potatoes everywhere.
-You watch your step.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.480
(phone chimes)

19:07.510 --> 19:10.380
Well, it's 48 minutes away.

19:10.410 --> 19:13.110
I guess I'll wait on the porch?

19:13.150 --> 19:14.850
"Uh...

19:14.880 --> 19:17.120
I'm a vegan."

19:17.150 --> 19:19.220
(Martha scoffs)

19:19.250 --> 19:20.860
-(exhales)
-(door opens)

19:20.890 --> 19:22.860
-I should drive her home.
-(door closes)

19:22.890 --> 19:25.990
If she's gonna throw up,
she should do it in her own car.

19:26.030 --> 19:27.500
And, um,

19:27.530 --> 19:30.570
look, I-I w-- I was just trying
to impress you all.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.200
I, uh...

19:32.230 --> 19:34.400
I'm not a vegan.

19:34.440 --> 19:38.110
I had a salami log
for breakfast this morning.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.310
Well, we've got
a lot of potatoes.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.350
They're everywhere.

19:53.190 --> 19:57.360
I'm sorry for being so weird
up there, Chip.

19:58.360 --> 19:59.890
That's okay, Martha.

19:59.930 --> 20:01.060
I was being weird, too.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.070
God, I was being so weird.

20:04.100 --> 20:07.500
You know,
I just need to realize...

20:07.540 --> 20:10.170
that...

20:10.200 --> 20:15.040
I-I don't need to be afraid
of growing up.

20:16.710 --> 20:20.280
And it's okay
to have a normal...

20:20.320 --> 20:23.420
happy existence.

20:24.920 --> 20:27.220
And that...

20:27.260 --> 20:29.920
for that to hap...

20:33.230 --> 20:35.230
(sighs)

20:37.230 --> 20:40.230
(singsongy):
You're turning into Martha.

20:40.270 --> 20:41.640
-(door opens)
-MRS. BASKETS: Ken!

20:41.670 --> 20:43.140
KEN:
In the kitchen!

20:43.170 --> 20:45.240
I didn't get the magnets.

20:45.270 --> 20:48.080
I think that young couple
sold 'em-- probably on eBay.

20:48.110 --> 20:50.810
I hope they got
a pretty penny for 'em,

20:50.850 --> 20:53.420
because they're collect...

20:53.450 --> 20:56.920
Ken, what did you do?

20:56.950 --> 20:58.650
Moving is hard.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.760
And I knew there was
a lot of stress on you.

21:00.790 --> 21:02.960
The place was a mess, so...

21:02.990 --> 21:05.230
I figured I'd try
to make it more homey.

21:05.260 --> 21:08.130
It's so beautiful, Ken.

21:08.160 --> 21:09.800
And take a look at this.

21:09.830 --> 21:13.640
Now you can decide
on whatever slogan you'd like.

21:17.270 --> 21:19.470
Thank you.

21:19.510 --> 21:22.480
Thank you, Ken.

21:22.510 --> 21:25.280
How thoughtful.

21:26.380 --> 21:28.820
(chuckles)

21:30.050 --> 21:31.620
I'm so sorry.

21:31.650 --> 21:34.460
I was just-- I'm so selfish.

21:34.490 --> 21:36.660
Oh, God.

21:36.690 --> 21:39.130
We have a lot of blenders,
don't we?

21:39.160 --> 21:40.260
KEN:
Yeah.

21:40.290 --> 21:42.500
We could start a smoothie stand.

21:42.530 --> 21:44.970
(both laughing)

21:46.130 --> 21:48.040
(sighs)

21:55.310 --> 21:57.680
TAMMY:
You're not your father.

21:57.710 --> 22:00.550
You are an important adult

22:00.580 --> 22:03.820
with an impressive life.

22:03.850 --> 22:06.220
(sighs) Okay.

22:06.250 --> 22:09.560
