00:35.502 --> 00:37.369
it's trashy as hell.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.616
- Yeah.

00:50.649 --> 00:52.786

I got this one--and I could

00:52.819 --> 00:55.655

01:24.840 --> 01:27.870
I really am.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.756
but you know what?

01:29.789 --> 01:31.257
She had a great time.

01:31.290 --> 01:34.360
Her friends had a great time,

01:31.290 --> 01:34.360
so that's all that matters.

01:34.394 --> 01:35.861
- I just thought to myself,

01:35.895 --> 01:39.865
"I have been raising kids

01:35.895 --> 01:39.865
since I was 21 years old."

01:50.810 --> 01:54.280
I'm not leaving my grandbabies

01:57.182 --> 01:58.585
till the day we die.

01:58.617 --> 02:00.853
- I've kind of reconciled

01:58.617 --> 02:00.853
myself to that.

02:00.887 --> 02:02.621
I mean, since the beginning

02:00.887 --> 02:02.621
of our relationship,

02:02.655 --> 02:04.456
it's never been

02:02.655 --> 02:04.456
just the two of us.

02:04.490 --> 02:06.292
- I already had two kids.

Chase followed shortly

02:06.325 --> 02:09.763
thereafter, then Savannah.

02:09.795 --> 02:12.298

02:09.795 --> 02:12.298
if we will ever get

02:12.331 --> 02:14.867
to that point

02:12.331 --> 02:14.867

02:14.901 --> 02:18.271

Don't you remember how fun

02:22.275 --> 02:24.544
that was when we kind of,

02:24.576 --> 02:27.347
like, would sneak away,

02:24.576 --> 02:27.347
we'd go to Charleston?

almost 30 years ago, so...

02:34.353 --> 02:36.222

you're smart.

03:13.926 --> 03:15.610
- Daddy, zip it.

03:15.949 --> 03:16.962

03:15.949 --> 03:16.962
a smart-ass comment.

He won't have many

03:24.699 --> 03:26.205

03:26.239 --> 03:27.907
- No way.

03:26.239 --> 03:27.907
- Are you kidding me?

03:27.941 --> 03:29.750
- Mm-mm.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.743
For as long

03:29.109 --> 03:30.743

03:30.776 --> 03:32.312
I've been blind

03:30.776 --> 03:32.312
as a damn bat.

03:32.344 --> 03:34.800
And I've always wanted

03:32.344 --> 03:34.800
to get Lasik done,

03:34.800 --> 03:35.682
but it scares the crap

03:34.800 --> 03:35.682
out of me.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.317
- But now you feel

03:35.715 --> 03:37.317
better about it.

03:37.349 --> 03:39.418
- I mean, not really,

03:37.349 --> 03:39.418
Savannah--it's terrifying.

03:39.451 --> 03:41.221
I mean, they cut

03:39.451 --> 03:41.221
into your eyeball.

03:41.253 --> 03:44.900
But I'm gonna do it anyway,

03:41.253 --> 03:44.900
I think.

03:44.900 --> 03:45.324
- [laughs]

03:45.358 --> 03:47.793
- I would let them

03:45.358 --> 03:47.793
just do one eye first.

03:47.826 --> 03:50.997
That way you can still

03:47.826 --> 03:50.997
get through life.

If you let them do both

03:52.979 --> 03:54.401
at one time

03:54.433 --> 03:56.670
and they screw them

03:54.433 --> 03:56.670

You can't be going at him

03:58.604 --> 04:00.139
like that.

what they do,

04:01.640 --> 04:03.643
'cause, you know,

04:01.640 --> 04:03.643

it, like, sizzles

04:03.676 --> 04:06.513

- Stop saying that.

04:07.847 --> 04:10.500
Why would you do that?

04:10.830 --> 04:11.550

04:11.584 --> 04:13.530
and you're just

04:11.584 --> 04:13.530
making it worse.

05:54.870 --> 05:56.889
- I'll give you that one.

05:54.870 --> 05:56.889
That was clever.

05:56.923 --> 06:00.427
Well, you know what?

05:56.923 --> 06:00.427
I got a surprise for you.

06:00.459 --> 06:04.129
I booked a week away for me

06:00.459 --> 06:04.129
and you at a spa and winery.

06:04.163 --> 06:06.660
- You did? For when?

06:06.990 --> 06:08.334
- Next week.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.637
I know it's shocking.

06:10.670 --> 06:14.740
- Well, listen, I greatly

06:10.670 --> 06:14.740
appreciate that gesture,

06:14.774 --> 06:16.709
but we have two children here

06:16.742 --> 06:20.346
who have to get back and forth

06:16.742 --> 06:20.346
to school, to activities.

06:20.379 --> 06:22.815
- Julie,

06:20.379 --> 06:22.815
Mama, Chase, Savannah--

06:22.848 --> 06:25.451
surely they can accomplish

06:22.848 --> 06:25.451
those things.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.454
- Okay. Well, Chloe has

06:25.485 --> 06:28.454
a parent-teacher conference

06:28.487 --> 06:30.356
next week,

06:28.487 --> 06:30.356
meaning it's the teacher,

06:30.389 --> 06:32.579
and it has to be a parent.

06:32.920 --> 06:33.293
- Julie, honey,

06:33.326 --> 06:35.295
it's time for us to throw

06:33.326 --> 06:35.295
caution to the wind.

06:35.327 --> 06:37.629
Let's just do

06:35.327 --> 06:37.629
what we want to do.

06:37.629 --> 06:40.233
- There's no way that

06:37.629 --> 06:40.233
I can be away for a week.

06:40.266 --> 06:42.668
- I mean, I thought this is

06:40.266 --> 06:42.668
what all women want--

06:42.701 --> 06:44.699
being surprised

06:44.103 --> 06:47.574
by, you know, an exotic trip,

06:44.103 --> 06:47.574
alone with a hot guy.

06:47.606 --> 06:48.942
- Honey, I would love that,

06:48.975 --> 06:50.509
but it takes a lot

06:48.975 --> 06:50.509
of preparation

06:50.543 --> 06:52.379
to make sure that the house

06:50.543 --> 06:52.379
is in order,

06:52.411 --> 06:53.846
that the kids

06:52.411 --> 06:53.846
are taken care of,

06:53.879 --> 06:55.247
that they have what they need.

06:55.281 --> 06:56.716
- Yeah, but what about

06:55.281 --> 06:56.716
what I need?

06:56.750 --> 06:59.853
- Well, yeah, that takes

06:56.750 --> 06:59.853
a lot of preparation, too.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.855
- Well, I was just trying

06:59.886 --> 07:01.855
to be spontaneous.

07:01.887 --> 07:03.122
But you know what?

07:03.156 --> 07:04.757
Shame on me for trying

07:03.156 --> 07:04.757
to do something nice.

07:04.790 --> 07:05.925
- Oh, gosh.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.793
- People leave their kids

07:06.259 --> 07:07.793
all the time.

07:07.826 --> 07:09.596
Let's be those parents.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.331
Give them a kiss.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.331
Give them a few bucks.

07:11.363 --> 07:13.733
And say, "We'll see you when

07:11.363 --> 07:13.733
we get back from the Bahamas."

07:13.766 --> 07:15.350
- Maybe one day.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.470
It's just this week

07:15.680 --> 07:17.470
it cannot work.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.172
- Julie, it's working.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.112
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

07:26.879 --> 07:28.514
<i>- What are we playing,</i>

07:26.879 --> 07:28.514

07:28.548 --> 07:29.615
- Blackjack.

07:28.548 --> 07:29.615
- All right.

07:29.649 --> 07:31.509
- I'm gonna

07:29.649 --> 07:31.509
tell you what, Chase.

07:31.509 --> 07:32.886
I was at the casino

07:31.509 --> 07:32.886
the other night

07:32.918 --> 07:34.454
and here come this gentleman.

07:34.487 --> 07:37.923
He kept saying that

07:34.487 --> 07:37.923
I had junk in my trunk.

07:37.956 --> 07:39.526
What does that mean?

07:39.558 --> 07:41.226
- Oh, my God.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.829
You got a lot of ass.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.497
- They always said I did.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.231
- Nanny!

07:44.531 --> 07:46.231
[laughs]

07:46.266 --> 07:47.733
God almighty.

07:47.766 --> 07:50.670
- So how you feel

07:47.766 --> 07:50.670
about your surgery coming up?

07:50.704 --> 07:51.771
- I'm really nervous.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.238
I mean, think about

07:51.805 --> 07:53.238
all that stuff

07:53.273 --> 07:55.875
that Dad said about the bacon

07:53.273 --> 07:55.875
and melting my eye.

07:55.908 --> 07:58.478
- He's been playing with us

07:55.908 --> 07:58.478
for years, lying.

07:58.511 --> 08:01.648
- Will you buy me a nice car?

08:01.680 --> 08:03.315
- I bought you a Ferrari,

08:03.350 --> 08:07.199
but you hit someone's car and

08:03.350 --> 08:07.199
left the scene of the accident.

08:07.199 --> 08:09.322
So now the police came

08:07.199 --> 08:09.322
to the house looking for you.

08:09.355 --> 08:11.156
- I wrecked my Ferrari?

08:11.190 --> 08:12.391
- Yeah, you did.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.226
- [crying]

08:14.259 --> 08:16.228
- So you ought to be

08:14.259 --> 08:16.228
used to it by now.

08:16.262 --> 08:18.310
- I know, but I'm starting

08:16.262 --> 08:18.310
to think

08:18.310 --> 08:19.565
about canceling my appointment

08:19.598 --> 08:21.468
because I don't want

08:19.598 --> 08:21.468
to deal with that.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.903
- No, you just keep right on

08:21.500 --> 08:23.903
doing what you plan on doing.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.939
- He's going to make me

08:23.937 --> 08:25.939
feel uncomfortable,

08:26.389 --> 08:28.240
so either way I go,

08:26.389 --> 08:28.240
I lose.

08:28.274 --> 08:30.442
- Well, that's just

08:28.274 --> 08:30.442
the typical Todd.

08:30.476 --> 08:33.480
When it comes to medical stuff,

08:30.476 --> 08:33.480
he makes light of it.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.347
You go on with your surgery.

08:35.381 --> 08:38.509
I know how to handle your dad.

08:38.509 --> 08:40.854
It's about time that your dad

08:38.509 --> 08:40.854
gets a taste

08:40.886 --> 08:42.187
of his own medicine.

08:42.221 --> 08:43.722
- I like the sound of that.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.924
- So we gonna send him

08:43.756 --> 08:45.924
on a wild-goose chase.

08:45.959 --> 08:49.528
And we gonna see how he likes

08:45.959 --> 08:49.528
it when the joke's on him.

08:49.562 --> 08:50.963
- Yeah, well, karma's

08:49.562 --> 08:50.963
a bitch.

08:51.639 --> 08:53.700
- You damn right,

08:51.639 --> 08:53.700
and her name is Faye Chrisley.

08:53.732 --> 08:54.868
- [laughs]

08:54.900 --> 08:56.769
- It's called

08:54.900 --> 08:56.769
sleight of the hand.

08:56.802 --> 09:00.572
I'll be playing with him here

08:56.802 --> 09:00.572
while I'm working him here.

but I cannot stand

09:10.500 --> 09:13.190
to get things in my teeth.

09:13.190 --> 09:15.654
See, you made a good choice.

09:13.190 --> 09:15.654
You got the chicken.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.691
- I know, but it's not

09:15.688 --> 09:17.691
as good as yours.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.826
No, I can't cook like her.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.826
No one can cook like her.

09:19.859 --> 09:21.326
Her food's like crack.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.129
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.798
- Listen, it is so nice

09:23.163 --> 09:25.798
just to be out,

09:25.831 --> 09:27.333
to have adult conversation.

09:27.366 --> 09:29.568
- I mean, I've actually been

09:27.366 --> 09:29.568
able to complete a sentence

09:29.601 --> 09:31.104
with you all

09:29.601 --> 09:31.104
without someone going, "Mom!"

09:31.136 --> 09:33.472
both:

09:31.136 --> 09:33.472
Mom! Mom! Mom!

09:33.505 --> 09:36.609
- "The PlayStation

09:33.505 --> 09:36.609
isn't working!"

09:36.643 --> 09:38.177
Then at night, I'm dog tired.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.578
You just want to run away.

09:39.611 --> 09:41.313
- Well, speaking

09:39.611 --> 09:41.313
of running away.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.383
Todd comes to me and says

09:41.347 --> 09:43.383
that he wants us

09:43.415 --> 09:44.616
to go away for a week.

09:44.650 --> 09:47.187
- A week?

09:44.650 --> 09:47.187
- To a winery and spa.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.389
I mean, he was trying

09:47.220 --> 09:49.389
to be spontaneous,

09:49.422 --> 09:53.590
but he doesn't even comprehend

09:49.422 --> 09:53.590
what it takes

09:53.929 --> 09:56.162
for the whole house to run.

09:56.196 --> 09:59.649
I mean, I know the romantic

09:56.196 --> 09:59.649
side of marriage is important,

09:59.990 --> 10:01.167
but where do you find the time?

10:01.201 --> 10:04.370
- It's just like exercise--

10:01.201 --> 10:04.370
you have to make it.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.405
You don't want to get

10:04.700 --> 10:06.405
complacent about those things.

10:06.438 --> 10:08.575
- Well, and, I mean, you may

10:06.438 --> 10:08.575
need to spice it up, Julie.

10:08.607 --> 10:09.808
- What?

10:09.842 --> 10:12.779
- Have you thought

10:09.842 --> 10:12.779
about a costume?

10:12.111 --> 10:13.379
- [laughs]

10:13.413 --> 10:15.914
- Thigh-highs and high heels.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.417
- [giggles]

10:17.450 --> 10:20.386
Todd would not even know what

10:17.450 --> 10:20.386
in the world was happening.

10:20.419 --> 10:21.921
- You know he would love it.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.899
- Lea, I just can't look at you

10:21.955 --> 10:24.899
the same anymore.

All right, girls, so here's

10:25.859 --> 10:30.263

Could he possibly

10:46.645 --> 10:48.815
use a different name?

10:48.847 --> 10:50.582
- He would never miss

10:48.847 --> 10:50.582
the opportunity

- Okay.

11:01.610 --> 11:02.961

- Mm.

you know,

11:53.746 --> 11:55.715
"Oh, my gosh,

11:53.746 --> 11:55.715
when I pick you up,

11:55.749 --> 11:57.450
"I hope you have

11:55.749 --> 11:57.450
two eyeballs still

11:57.484 --> 11:59.619
and I hope there's not

11:57.484 --> 11:59.619
something wrong"?

11:59.652 --> 12:01.620
I mean, you do this

11:59.652 --> 12:01.620
all the time.

12:01.653 --> 12:03.756
- Who, me?

12:01.653 --> 12:03.756
- Yeah.

12:05.424 --> 12:07.894

12:19.720 --> 12:20.572

12:20.606 --> 12:21.875

12:21.908 --> 12:23.308
- I think Daddy's still mad

12:23.342 --> 12:25.245
about what happened

12:23.342 --> 12:25.245
with Chase yesterday.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.980
- Do you know how bad

12:25.278 --> 12:26.980
you got to be

12:27.799 --> 12:28.248
for Chase to pull fast one?

12:28.280 --> 12:29.783
- Yeah, I know.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.783
- [laughs]

12:29.816 --> 12:31.150
- That is hot.

12:31.183 --> 12:33.253
I mean, that's the spiciest

12:31.183 --> 12:33.253
cheese I've ever had.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.754
- But it's also one

12:33.286 --> 12:34.754
of those things that, like,

12:34.788 --> 12:37.899
you want to have another bite.

12:34.788 --> 12:37.899
- Yeah.

12:37.899 --> 12:39.725
I've had some relationships

12:37.899 --> 12:39.725
like that, you know?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.860
[Laughter]

12:41.894 --> 12:43.730
both: Hey.

12:41.894 --> 12:43.730
- How are you?

12:43.763 --> 12:45.130
- It's about time

12:43.763 --> 12:45.130
you showed up.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.100
Yeah, your tea

12:45.164 --> 12:47.100
is probably watered.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.835
- I'm absolutely the busiest

12:47.100 --> 12:48.835
human being

12:48.868 --> 12:50.302
in the world right now.

12:50.336 --> 12:52.639
- You feeling better

12:50.336 --> 12:52.639
after yesterday?

12:52.672 --> 12:55.375
- You mean from the wild-goose

12:52.672 --> 12:55.375
chase that Chase sent me on?

12:55.408 --> 12:57.143
- Yes.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.143
- No.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.714
- Well, and I know

12:58.778 --> 13:00.714
that you're upset.

13:00.746 --> 13:02.548
So I have something

13:00.746 --> 13:02.548
to cheer you up.

13:02.581 --> 13:05.818
Our wonderful daughter

13:02.581 --> 13:05.818
volunteered to babysit tonight.

13:05.851 --> 13:08.120
And you and I are gonna go

13:05.851 --> 13:08.120
to a drive-in movie.

13:08.153 --> 13:11.124
- Honey, that all sounds great,

13:08.153 --> 13:11.124
but that can't happen tonight.

13:11.157 --> 13:13.929
- Really?

13:13.125 --> 13:14.793
- Tonight's just not

13:13.125 --> 13:14.793
a good time.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.229
I didn't get anything

13:14.827 --> 13:16.229
done yesterday

13:16.261 --> 13:18.932
with that damn eye appointment,

13:16.261 --> 13:18.932
and today's booked up.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.900
It would be great,

13:18.965 --> 13:21.900
but, listen, I can't do it.

13:21.934 --> 13:23.570
- I mean,

13:21.934 --> 13:23.570
just shoot me in the foot.

13:23.602 --> 13:25.572
I was just trying

13:23.602 --> 13:25.572
to do something nice

13:25.605 --> 13:27.774
just to try to make up

13:25.605 --> 13:27.774
for the other day.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.775
I'm telling you,

13:27.807 --> 13:29.775
this spontaneity stuff--

13:29.808 --> 13:31.244
it's hard work.

13:31.277 --> 13:33.789
I mean, I can't believe

13:31.277 --> 13:33.789
we're having this much trouble

13:33.789 --> 13:34.581
just trying to plan a date.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.982
- Well, honey, I can, because

13:34.614 --> 13:36.982
you and I are in high demand.

13:37.830 --> 13:38.384
- Well, listen,

13:37.830 --> 13:38.384
I'm not giving up.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.153
- Well, neither am I.

13:40.186 --> 13:41.754
- Well, you know,

13:40.186 --> 13:41.754
it would have been fun

13:41.788 --> 13:43.523
to actually go

13:41.788 --> 13:43.523
to an old-school drive-in,

13:43.556 --> 13:46.960
watch a movie

13:43.556 --> 13:46.960
in the car by ourselves.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.928
- I just don't know that

13:46.993 --> 13:49.928
you're that limber anymore.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.398
- Oh, my God.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.398
- Oh, please.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.533
It's like riding a bicycle.

13:53.566 --> 13:56.269
- I'm right here.

13:53.566 --> 13:56.269
I'm right here.

13:56.302 --> 13:58.738
- How do you think

13:56.302 --> 13:58.738
you got here?

14:04.210 --> 14:06.460
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

14:07.470 --> 14:11.317
- Julie, don't you love

14:07.470 --> 14:11.317
the smell of this room?

14:11.350 --> 14:12.951
- Kind of, but...

14:13.529 --> 14:15.254
- It's cedar.

14:13.529 --> 14:15.254
- Yeah, I know it's cedar.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.856
- It keeps things

14:15.288 --> 14:17.856
from deteriorating,

14:17.890 --> 14:20.600
which is why I want

14:17.890 --> 14:20.600
to put me a bed up in here.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.427
- You're just going

14:20.600 --> 14:21.427
to sleep in here?

14:21.461 --> 14:22.928
- I'm going to sleep

14:21.461 --> 14:22.928
in the aroma

14:22.961 --> 14:25.649
so maybe that'll stop

14:22.961 --> 14:25.649
the aging process.

14:25.980 --> 14:26.399
- Gotcha.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.268
- If it keeps moths out,

14:26.432 --> 14:28.268
maybe it'll keep age out.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.903
- [laughs]

14:28.301 --> 14:29.903
Okay.

14:29.936 --> 14:31.738
- Julie, you got to promise

14:29.936 --> 14:31.738
that you're not going to tell

14:31.770 --> 14:33.940
these kids about this closet,

14:31.770 --> 14:33.940
especially Chase,

14:33.972 --> 14:35.475
because, hell,

14:33.972 --> 14:35.475
I won't have anything left.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.676
- [laughs]

14:35.508 --> 14:36.676
Okay.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.144
I mean, he literally

14:36.710 --> 14:38.144
would treat it

14:38.177 --> 14:40.279
like he's at Bloomingdale's.

14:38.177 --> 14:40.279
- Yeah, I totally get that.

14:40.312 --> 14:43.383
But speaking of Chase, he's

14:40.312 --> 14:43.383
doing great after his Lasik.

14:43.415 --> 14:44.984
And I know you want

14:43.415 --> 14:44.984
to see him.

14:45.850 --> 14:47.953
- Julie, I love him more than

14:45.850 --> 14:47.953
anything in this world.

14:47.986 --> 14:49.855
And you know that.

14:47.986 --> 14:49.855
- I do know that.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.624
- But, I mean, clearly,

14:49.889 --> 14:51.624
he doesn't want me around.

14:51.658 --> 14:54.827
- In all honesty,

14:51.658 --> 14:54.827
can't say that I blame him.

14:56.960 --> 14:57.397
- What are you talking about?

14:57.429 --> 14:58.965
- Well, I think he was

14:57.429 --> 14:58.965
just a little nervous

14:58.998 --> 15:01.100
that you were gonna poke fun.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.370
I mean, surely, you can see

15:01.134 --> 15:03.370
where he's coming from.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.773
I mean, let's not forget about

15:03.403 --> 15:06.773
his wisdom-teeth procedure,

15:06.806 --> 15:08.607
my bunion surgery.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.610
- You was walking to the left.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.610
- Okay.

15:10.643 --> 15:11.910
- I mean, you had a hoof.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.214
- Let me tell you something

15:11.945 --> 15:14.214
about this foot.

15:14.246 --> 15:17.517
It's still well enough to put

15:14.246 --> 15:17.517
it where the sun don't shine,

15:17.549 --> 15:19.552
so just remember that.

15:17.549 --> 15:19.552
- [laughs]

15:19.586 --> 15:22.522
- I admit that I make fun

15:19.586 --> 15:22.522
of situations

15:22.554 --> 15:26.919
because I get afraid

15:22.554 --> 15:26.919
that something might go wrong.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.227
So I poke at it,

15:26.125 --> 15:28.227
I make jokes of it,

15:28.260 --> 15:31.130
only because

15:28.260 --> 15:31.130
I'm nervous about it myself.

15:31.163 --> 15:33.533
- And I get that

15:31.163 --> 15:33.533
that's your coping mechanism,

15:33.566 --> 15:35.679
but sometimes it's not easy

15:35.679 --> 15:36.568
when you're

15:35.679 --> 15:36.568
on the receiving end.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.710
I mean, trust me, I know.

15:38.710 --> 15:40.907
- Come on, get out.

15:38.710 --> 15:40.907
- My foot hurts so bad.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.942
- You look so sexy

15:40.940 --> 15:42.942
with that thing.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.576
- Shut up.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.179
Just saying.

15:47.212 --> 15:49.115
Chase has gotten

15:47.212 --> 15:49.115
the worst of it from you.

15:49.149 --> 15:52.152
So, I mean, surely,

15:49.149 --> 15:52.152
you can see why he's weary.

15:52.184 --> 15:53.552
- Okay,

15:52.184 --> 15:53.552
you may have a point.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.754
And I will go check on him.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.754
- Thank you.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.923
That's all I needed.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.923
- I do want to see him.

15:57.956 --> 15:59.919
And I want to make sure

15:57.956 --> 15:59.919
he's okay.

15:59.919 --> 16:02.279
I mean, I went

15:59.919 --> 16:02.279
and got a basket for him.

16:02.279 --> 16:03.462
- Well, that was

16:02.279 --> 16:03.462
very nice of you.

16:03.495 --> 16:05.649
- But I've got a good mind

16:03.495 --> 16:05.649
to keep it,

16:05.980 --> 16:06.765
'cause do you understand

16:05.980 --> 16:06.765
what I paid

16:06.799 --> 16:08.201
for that eye cream

16:06.799 --> 16:08.201
that's in there?

16:08.234 --> 16:11.270
- Oh, my gosh.

16:08.234 --> 16:11.270
- It's good. It's from Paris.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.706
- Just give him the basket.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.307
- I'm gonna take

16:12.739 --> 16:14.307
the eye cream out.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.809
- [sighs]

- I'm going to give you

16:33.726 --> 16:35.662
a massage.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.230
You'll give me a massage.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.499
And we'll kind of do role play,

16:37.263 --> 16:39.499

16:39.532 --> 16:42.434
I'll be the naughty masseuse.

You'll be the naughty masseuse.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.937
- Yeah, okay.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.572
- I need you to be

16:43.970 --> 16:45.572
a little naughtier.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.474
- The kids are away

16:45.605 --> 16:47.474
at your mom's.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.642
So we actually have

16:47.506 --> 16:49.642
some alone time.

16:49.676 --> 16:53.212
- So we gonna make it happen.

16:49.676 --> 16:53.212
- We're gonna make it happen.

16:53.245 --> 16:55.548
- Your world is getting ready

16:53.245 --> 16:55.548
to change.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.517
- Oh, good.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.517
I need for it to.

16:57.549 --> 17:00.886
- You tell me that Todd doesn't

16:57.549 --> 17:00.886
come up with some great ideas.

17:00.919 --> 17:02.220
- Yes.

17:02.220 --> 17:03.355
- You got a lot of knots

17:02.220 --> 17:03.355
to work out.

17:03.389 --> 17:06.920
- I do. Try living with

- None of your business.

17:23.609 --> 17:27.646
some dinner, but...

17:23.609 --> 17:27.646
- But I think the answer is no.

17:27.681 --> 17:31.317
I have never walked into

17:27.681 --> 17:31.317
something so awkward.

17:31.351 --> 17:34.220
This was, like,

17:31.351 --> 17:34.220
full-on Mom naked.

17:34.253 --> 17:37.900
Don't know if Dad had anything

17:34.253 --> 17:37.900
on underneath that.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.599
I'm scarred.

17:40.599 --> 17:41.326
- [grunts]

17:41.361 --> 17:43.630
Get rid of them, please.

17:43.630 --> 17:44.963
- You know, why don't y'all

17:43.630 --> 17:44.963
go on to dinner

17:45.650 --> 17:46.266
and not call us later?

17:46.298 --> 17:48.101
- Yeah, I think

17:46.298 --> 17:48.101
that's what we should do.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.170
Come on, let's...

17:48.134 --> 17:50.170
- Do your thing, Todd.

17:50.202 --> 17:51.337
- Yeah, let's go.

17:52.538 --> 17:54.307
- I knew we shouldn't have

17:52.538 --> 17:54.307
given them a key.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.759
- If only.

17:56.759 --> 18:00.113
<i>* *</i>

18:00.145 --> 18:02.150
<i>- How do you feel?</i>

18:02.150 --> 18:04.384
- My eyes are just kind of sore

18:02.150 --> 18:04.384
and burning.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.786
- Does your head hurt?

18:04.416 --> 18:06.786
- My arm kind of hurts.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.788
- Your arm.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.788
After you just had eye surgery?

18:09.823 --> 18:12.358
- I hate to see

18:09.823 --> 18:12.358
my little guy like this.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.859
- But do my arm and my head.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.960
[door closes]

18:13.893 --> 18:16.960
- Hey, honey. How are you?

18:16.128 --> 18:18.980
- Well, hi, how you doing?

18:16.128 --> 18:18.980
- Hey, darling.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.531
- Where are my glasses, Emmy?

18:19.566 --> 18:22.349
- Right here. Here you go.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.349
- Can you see?

18:22.349 --> 18:23.536
- If you've come here

18:22.349 --> 18:23.536
to make fun of me,

18:23.569 --> 18:27.400
just turn right around.

18:23.569 --> 18:27.400
- I'm not here to make fun.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.142
I brought you

18:27.400 --> 18:29.142
a basket of gifts.

18:29.174 --> 18:32.578
- Oh, I like gifts.

18:29.174 --> 18:32.578
- [laughs]

18:32.612 --> 18:33.712
- Look at that.

18:33.747 --> 18:35.949
- Wow.

18:33.747 --> 18:35.949
- Thank you.

18:36.490 --> 18:40.487
- Listen, I have decided

18:36.490 --> 18:40.487
that I am no longer

18:40.519 --> 18:43.288
going to torture my children.

18:40.519 --> 18:43.288
- Wow.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.325
- I love y'all more

18:43.323 --> 18:45.325
than anything in the world.

18:45.357 --> 18:47.326
And when I think

18:45.357 --> 18:47.326
about y'all being in pain

18:47.359 --> 18:49.261
or having to be put under,

18:49.295 --> 18:51.964
my way of coping

18:49.295 --> 18:51.964
with that is just humor.

18:52.650 --> 18:54.334
It's to be funny.

18:52.650 --> 18:54.334
It's to joke around.

18:54.366 --> 18:55.969
- But you're not funny.

18:56.690 --> 18:58.304
- Chase, come on,

18:56.690 --> 18:58.304
the wisdom teeth, it was funny.

18:58.337 --> 19:00.240
- It was funny.

19:00.272 --> 19:02.474
- I do feel bad

19:00.272 --> 19:02.474
that I made you feel nervous.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.178
So, I mean, I am sorry.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.178
- Well, thank you.

19:05.211 --> 19:08.181
- So you're gonna say

19:05.211 --> 19:08.181
I'm sorry back.

19:08.213 --> 19:10.182
- I'm not sorry.

19:10.215 --> 19:11.483
- So childish.

19:13.385 --> 19:15.454
- All right, maybe I'm sorry.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.290
Daddy, I cannot

19:15.488 --> 19:18.290
even put into words

19:18.324 --> 19:21.269
how amazing it is

19:18.324 --> 19:21.269
to have 20/20 vision.

19:21.269 --> 19:23.462
- Oh, I'm so thankful.

19:21.269 --> 19:23.462
- I'm so glad.

19:23.496 --> 19:26.566
- Because now I can truly see

19:23.496 --> 19:26.566
how much you've aged.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.634
- Okay. Okay.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.634
- Oh, gosh.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.538
- I'm 20/20

19:28.667 --> 19:32.538
and you're looking 50, 60.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.574
- Get the hell

19:32.572 --> 19:34.574
out of here.

19:40.113 --> 19:42.749
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

19:43.490 --> 19:46.185
<i>* *</i>

19:46.219 --> 19:48.355
- Come on, Nanny!

19:46.219 --> 19:48.355
- I'm so ready for this.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.856
We can go shopping.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.856
I don't have to drive.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.224
- No, it's gonna be good.

19:52.258 --> 19:54.760
So the trolley

19:52.258 --> 19:54.760
will pick us up here.

19:54.794 --> 19:57.630
It'll stop, get off, you shop.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.732
You go get something to eat,

19:57.630 --> 19:59.732
then you hit the next stop.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.401
- Well, I'm gonna love that.

20:01.433 --> 20:03.303
- You know, I am bummed

20:01.433 --> 20:03.303
that Chloe's not here

20:03.336 --> 20:05.137
'cause she would love it,

20:03.336 --> 20:05.137
but you know what?

20:05.171 --> 20:07.507
She's probably having

20:05.171 --> 20:07.507
much more fun at her playdate.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.420
- Now, how long

20:07.539 --> 20:09.420
is this trolley?

20:09.750 --> 20:10.410
- Like, three hours.

20:10.442 --> 20:12.979
- Well, we can do a lot

20:10.442 --> 20:12.979
of damage in three hours.

20:13.130 --> 20:14.814
- [laughs]

20:13.130 --> 20:14.814
- Here we go.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.883
Mama, if you're planning

20:14.847 --> 20:16.883
on getting drunk,

20:16.915 --> 20:18.250
I got bad news for you.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.619
There's no alcohol

20:18.284 --> 20:20.619
on this thing.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.256
- That you know of.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.256
- She's got it hidden.

20:23.288 --> 20:25.592
- Savannah...

20:23.288 --> 20:25.592
- I'm not responsible for her.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.193
- You shake her down and

20:25.625 --> 20:28.193
find out where that flask is.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.930
- Well, that flask is somewhere

20:28.228 --> 20:30.930
that nobody's been

20:30.963 --> 20:33.799
since your papa left you.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.799
- Nanny!

20:33.833 --> 20:35.701
Look!

20:33.833 --> 20:35.701
There's the trolley, y'all!

20:35.734 --> 20:38.538
- So much fun.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.538
- It's going to be so much fun.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.740
- I'm excited for this.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.740
- Me too.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.276
I can't hardly wait to ride it.

20:43.308 --> 20:45.478
- You got it?

20:43.308 --> 20:45.478
- Yes.

20:45.511 --> 20:48.781
- What is it?

20:45.511 --> 20:48.781
- We ain't going with them.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.282
- What do you mean?

20:50.316 --> 20:52.585
- I organized this trolley trip

20:50.316 --> 20:52.585
for the entire family

20:52.618 --> 20:55.521
so that I could spend time

20:52.618 --> 20:55.521
with you, just us together.

20:55.555 --> 20:56.855
- I love it.

20:56.890 --> 20:58.657
- You know, if this week

20:56.890 --> 20:58.657
has taught me anything,

20:58.692 --> 21:00.794
it's taught me

20:58.692 --> 21:00.794
that being spontaneous

21:00.826 --> 21:03.163
doesn't have to be

21:00.826 --> 21:03.163
this huge, big event.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.230
It's about stealing

21:03.195 --> 21:05.230
little moments,

21:05.265 --> 21:06.932
you know, with each other

21:05.265 --> 21:06.932
when you can.

21:06.965 --> 21:09.201
- And that a little time

21:06.965 --> 21:09.201
goes a long way.

21:09.234 --> 21:12.739
- Yes, and in our case,

21:09.234 --> 21:12.739
five minutes.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.941
- [chuckles]

21:14.973 --> 21:17.509
- Where are you going?

21:14.973 --> 21:17.509
- We're going to dinner.

21:17.544 --> 21:18.912
- What?

21:17.544 --> 21:18.912
- Bye-bye.

21:18.944 --> 21:22.248
- Have fun!

21:18.944 --> 21:22.248
- They just ditched us.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.517
- We'll have more fun

21:22.281 --> 21:24.517
without them.

21:24.550 --> 21:25.919
- Suckers!

21:25.951 --> 21:27.854
- Oh, my gosh.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.854
What are we doing?

21:27.886 --> 21:30.123
- Whatever you and I want to do

21:27.886 --> 21:30.123
for a change.
