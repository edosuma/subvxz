WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:04.429
Oh, it's a sanctuary base!
Deep space exploration.

00:04.546 --> 00:06.298
"Welcome to hell."

00:06.423 --> 00:08.175
What are you lot doing here?

00:08.258 --> 00:11.182
- That's a black hole.
- But that's impossible.

00:11.261 --> 00:15.357
This lump of rock is suspended
in perpetual geostationary orbit

00:15.432 --> 00:18.276
around that black hole, without falling in.

00:18.352 --> 00:21.071
There's some sort of power source
holding us here.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.819
We're drilling down to try and find it.

00:25.609 --> 00:26.906
The Tardis is gone.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.864
Well, whatever it is down there,
it's not a natural phenomenon.

00:29.947 --> 00:32.746
And there was some form of civilisation.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.167
They buried something.

00:37.329 --> 00:39.548
- What are they called?
- They're the Ood.

00:39.623 --> 00:40.840
Basic slave race.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.715
There's something happening with the Ood.

00:43.794 --> 00:46.263
And you will worship him.

00:49.925 --> 00:53.850
You can tell Toby
we've found his civilisation.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.894
These are the words of the Beast.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.646
And he has woken.

00:57.766 --> 01:01.191
I have been imprisoned for eternity.

01:01.270 --> 01:03.068
But no more.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.147
The Pit is open

01:06.191 --> 01:09.991
and I am free!

01:49.818 --> 01:51.695
Open fire!

01:59.077 --> 02:02.581
We're stabilising. We've got orbit.

02:07.711 --> 02:12.968
Doctor? Doctor, can you hear me?
Doctor, Ida, are you there?

02:14.718 --> 02:16.516
It's me!

02:17.387 --> 02:20.266
But they're coming. It's the Ood.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.976
- They've gone mad.
- How many of them?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.773
All of them, all 50.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.650
Danny, out of the way. Out of the way!

02:25.729 --> 02:28.733
But they're armed. It's
the interface device.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.943
I don't know how,
but they're using it as a weapon.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.086
Close door 7.

02:50.337 --> 02:53.341
Open door 7. Close door 7.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.721
Lockdown! Seal door 1!

02:55.801 --> 02:59.431
Seal door 25.
Seal door 24. Seal door 23!

02:59.554 --> 03:01.272
Jefferson, what's happening there?

03:01.348 --> 03:04.602
I've got very little ammunition, sir.
How about you?

03:06.144 --> 03:10.194
All I've got is a bolt-gun with, uh,
all of one bolt.

03:10.273 --> 03:14.119
I could take out a grand total of one Ood.
Fat lot of good that is.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.073
Given the emergency,
I recommend strategy nine.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.869
Strategy nine agreed.
Right, we need to get everyone together.

03:21.952 --> 03:25.047
Rose, what about Ida and the Doctor?
Any word?

03:25.122 --> 03:29.218
I can't get a reply. just nothing.
I keep trying, but it's...

03:29.292 --> 03:32.296
No, sorry. I'm fine. Still here!

03:32.379 --> 03:34.131
You could have said, you stupid...

03:35.590 --> 03:37.058
Whoa, careful!

03:37.134 --> 03:39.887
Anyway, it's both of us, me and Ida. Hello!

03:39.970 --> 03:44.146
But the seal opened up. It's gone.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.903
All we've got left is this chasm.

03:48.311 --> 03:52.066
- How deep is it?
- Can't tell. Looks like it goes down forever.

03:52.149 --> 03:55.244
The Pit is open. That's
what the voice said.

03:55.318 --> 03:59.414
But there's nothing.
I mean, there's nothing coming out?

03:59.489 --> 04:02.163
No, no, no. No sign of the Beast.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.619
It said Satan.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.500
Come on, Rose. Keep it together.

04:05.579 --> 04:09.425
Is there no such thing? Doctor?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.508
<i>Doctor; tell me there</i> 3 <i>no such thing.</i>

04:13.587 --> 04:17.091
Ida, I recommend
that you withdraw immediately.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.596
But we've come all this way.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.350
Okay, that was an order. Withdraw!

04:22.429 --> 04:24.682
When that thing opened,
the whole planet shifted.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.604
One more inch
and we fall into the black hole

04:26.725 --> 04:28.602
so this thing stops right now.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.438
But it's not much better up there
with the Ood.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.657
I'm initiating strategy nine

04:33.732 --> 04:37.487
so I need the two of you
back up top immediately. No...

04:38.945 --> 04:41.494
Ida? Ida?

04:42.073 --> 04:43.871
What do you think?

04:45.202 --> 04:46.624
He gave an order.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.957
Yeah, but what do you think?

04:52.918 --> 04:56.138
It said, "I am the temptation."

04:59.716 --> 05:04.973
If there's something in there,
why is it still hiding?

05:05.180 --> 05:09.481
Maybe we opened the prison
but not the cell.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.488
We should go down.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.066
I'd go.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.993
What about you?

05:19.069 --> 05:21.743
Oh, in a second. But then again...

05:24.074 --> 05:26.076
That is so human.

05:26.576 --> 05:29.079
Where angels fear to tread.

05:30.247 --> 05:33.000
Even now, standing on the edge,

05:34.376 --> 05:37.095
it's that feeling you get, yeah?

05:38.672 --> 05:40.720
Right at the back of your head.

05:41.383 --> 05:45.809
That impulse, that strange little impulse.

05:46.888 --> 05:51.485
That mad little voice saying,
"Go on, go on, go on."

05:51.768 --> 05:54.237
"Go over, go on."

05:56.064 --> 05:58.658
Maybe it's relying on that.

06:00.068 --> 06:03.948
For once in my life, Officer Scott,

06:04.072 --> 06:06.200
I'm going to say...

06:08.910 --> 06:11.038
retreat.

06:12.664 --> 06:16.294
Now I know I'm getting old.
Rose, we're coming back.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.221
Best news I've heard all day.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.719
What are you doing?

06:21.798 --> 06:25.473
He's infected. He brought
that thing on board. You saw it.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.852
Are you gonna start shooting your own
people now? Is that what you're gonna do?

06:28.930 --> 06:30.853
- Is it?
- If necessary.

06:30.932 --> 06:34.982
Well, then you'll have to shoot me,
if necessary. So what's it gonna be?

06:37.230 --> 06:40.655
Look at his face. Whatever
it was, it's gone.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.157
It passed into the Ood. You saw it happen.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.826
He's clean.

06:48.199 --> 06:51.328
Any sign of trouble, I shoot him.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.547
You all right?

06:56.124 --> 06:57.171
Yeah.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.254
- I don't know.
- Can you remember anything?

07:00.337 --> 07:03.011
Just... It was so angry.

07:03.089 --> 07:07.686
It was fury and rage and death.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.979
It was him.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.606
It was the Devil.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.112
Come here.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.446
What's strategy nine?

07:26.529 --> 07:31.501
Open the airlocks.
We'll be safe inside the lockdown.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.829
The Ood will get thrown out
into the vacuum.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.165
So we're going back to a slaughter?

07:37.123 --> 07:38.841
The Devil's work.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.880
Okay, we 're in. Bring us up.

07:44.464 --> 07:49.686
Ascension in three, two, one.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.733
This is the darkness.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.486
This is my domain.

08:01.564 --> 08:05.819
You little things that live in the light,

08:05.902 --> 08:08.826
clinging to your feeble suns

08:08.905 --> 08:11.033
which die, in the end...

08:11.116 --> 08:14.120
That's not the Ood.
Something is talking through them.

08:14.202 --> 08:17.331
Only the darkness remains.

08:17.622 --> 08:21.422
This is Captain Zachary Cross Flane
of Sanctuary Base 6,

08:21.501 --> 08:23.799
representing the Torchwood Archive.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.301
You will identify yourself.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.600
You know my name.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.222
What do you want?

08:30.301 --> 08:34.932
You will die here, all of you.
This planet is your grave.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.813
It's him. It's him. It's him.

08:38.058 --> 08:41.654
If you are the Beast, then answer me this.
Which one, hmm?

08:41.770 --> 08:44.615
'Cause the universe has been busy
since you've been gone.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.285
There's more religions
than there are planets in the sky.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.613
The Arkiphets, Quoldonity,

08:49.738 --> 08:53.083
Christianity, Pash Pash, Nee-Judaism,

08:53.158 --> 08:56.503
San Claar, the Church of the Tin Vagabond.
Which devil are you?

08:56.578 --> 08:58.205
All of them.

08:58.288 --> 09:01.667
What, then you're the truth
behind the myth?

09:01.750 --> 09:05.800
This one knows me as I know him.

09:05.879 --> 09:09.304
The killer of his own kind.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.177
How did you end up on this rock?

09:12.260 --> 09:15.935
The Disc/pies of the Light
rose up against me

09:16.014 --> 09:20.144
and chained me in the Pit for all eternity.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.603
When was this?

09:21.686 --> 09:23.188
Before time.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.656
What does that mean?

09:24.731 --> 09:26.779
Before time.

09:26.858 --> 09:29.077
What did "before time" mean?

09:29.152 --> 09:33.953
Before time and light
and space and matter.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.581
Before the cataclysm.

09:36.659 --> 09:40.414
Before this universe was created.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.842
That's impossible.
No life could have existed back then.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.636
Is that your religion?

09:48.129 --> 09:49.597
It's a belief.

09:49.672 --> 09:54.348
You know nothing. All of you, so small.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.481
The captain, so scared of command.

09:59.057 --> 10:03.858
<i>The soldier;
haunted by the eyes of his wife.</i>

10:04.687 --> 10:08.487
The scientist, still running from daddy.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.496
The little boy who lied

10:12.570 --> 10:17.451
the virgin and the lost girl.

10:17.534 --> 10:20.754
So far away from home.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.048
The valiant child

10:23.123 --> 10:26.878
who will die in battle so very soon.

10:27.710 --> 10:30.634
- Doctor, what does that mean?
- Rose, don't listen.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.135
What does it mean?

10:32.215 --> 10:34.217
You will die

10:35.260 --> 10:37.433
and I will live.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.600
What the hell was that?

10:41.683 --> 10:44.277
I had that thing inside my head.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.068
- Doctor, what did it mean?
- What do we do?

10:48.189 --> 10:50.863
Captain, what's the situation
with strategy nine?

10:50.942 --> 10:53.536
The black hole, everything's true!

10:53.611 --> 10:54.988
We've lost pictures.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.031
- How did it know...
- Did anyone get an analysis?

10:57.073 --> 10:58.290
Jefferson.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.118
Stop. Everyone, just stop!

11:00.243 --> 11:02.245
- What do we do?
- Report...

11:04.330 --> 11:06.128
If you want voices in the dark,
then listen to mine.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.710
That thing is playing on very basic fears.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.592
Darkness, childhood, nightmares,
all that stuff.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.173
But that's how the Devil works.

11:13.256 --> 11:14.803
Or a good psychologist.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.427
How did it know about my father?

11:17.510 --> 11:20.605
Okay, but what makes his version
of the truth any better than mine, hmm?

11:20.680 --> 11:23.183
'Cause I'll tell you what I can see.
Humans.

11:23.266 --> 11:27.237
Brilliant humans. Humans who travel
all the way across space.

11:27.312 --> 11:30.942
Flying in a tiny little rocket
right into the orbit of a black hole,

11:31.024 --> 11:33.948
just for the sake of discovery.
That's amazing!

11:34.027 --> 11:35.950
Do you hear me? Amazing. All of you.

11:36.070 --> 11:40.871
The captain, his officer, his elder,
his juniors, his friends.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.830
All with one advantage,
the Beast is alone, we are not.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.298
If we can use that to fight against him...

11:52.420 --> 11:53.717
The cable's snapped!

11:53.796 --> 11:55.264
Get out!

12:03.139 --> 12:07.110
Doctor, we lost the cable.
Doctor, are you all right?

12:07.185 --> 12:08.357
Doctor?

12:08.436 --> 12:10.939
- Comms are down.
- Doctor, can you hear me?

12:11.022 --> 12:13.616
I've still got life-signs,
but we've lost the capsule.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.695
- Say something! Are you there?
- There's no way out.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.530
They're stuck down there.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.669
How much air have we got?

12:25.787 --> 12:27.505
Sixty minutes.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.584
Fifty-five.

12:32.502 --> 12:33.879
But we've got to bring them back.

12:34.003 --> 12:37.553
They're ten miles down.
We haven't got another ten miles of cable.

12:40.385 --> 12:43.980
Captain, situation report?

12:58.861 --> 13:03.241
It's the Ood. They're cutting through
the door bolts. They're breaking in.

13:03.366 --> 13:06.870
- Yes. Same on door 25.
- How long is it gonna take?

13:06.953 --> 13:09.706
Well, it's only a basic frame.
Should take ten minutes.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.877
Eight.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.723
I've got a security frame, might last
a bit longer but that doesn't help you.

13:18.840 --> 13:22.470
Right. So we need to stop them
or get out or both.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.354
I'll take both, yeah? But how?

13:25.430 --> 13:28.650
You heard the Doctor.
Why do you think that thing cut him off?

13:28.725 --> 13:30.102
'Cause he was making sense.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.729
He was telling you
to think your way out of this.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.065
Come on! For starters,
we need some lights.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.228
Zack, there's got to be
some sort of power somewhere.

13:37.275 --> 13:42.406
There's nothing I can do. Some captain!
Stuck in here, pressing buttons.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.207
That's what the Doctor meant.
Press the right buttons.

13:45.283 --> 13:48.002
They've gutted the generators.

13:48.077 --> 13:51.377
But the rocket's got an independent supply.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.757
If I could reroute that...

13:54.584 --> 13:57.679
Mr Jefferson, open the bypass conduits.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.722
Override the safety.

13:59.797 --> 14:03.222
Opening bypass conduits, sir.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.352
Channelling rocket feed.

14:06.929 --> 14:11.435
In three, two, one.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.736
Power.

14:14.604 --> 14:15.901
There we go!

14:15.980 --> 14:18.358
- Let there be light!
- What about that strategy nine thing?

14:18.441 --> 14:20.535
Not enough power, needs 100 percent.

14:20.610 --> 14:24.205
Right, we need a way out. Zack,
Mr Jefferson, you start working on that.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.999
- Toby, what about you?
- I'm not a soldier. I can't do anything.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.995
No, you're the archaeologist.
What do you know about the Pit?

14:30.078 --> 14:31.955
Nothing, we can't even
translate the language.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.424
- Right.
- Hold on. Maybe...

14:35.249 --> 14:36.501
What is it?

14:37.960 --> 14:41.715
Since that thing was inside my head,
it's like the letters make more sense.

14:41.798 --> 14:46.019
Well, get to work.
Anything you can translate, just, anything.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.976
As for you, Danny boy,
you're in charge of the Ood.

14:49.097 --> 14:52.647
- Any way of stopping them?
- Well, I don't know.

14:52.934 --> 14:56.108
Then find out.
The sooner we get control of the base,

14:56.187 --> 14:59.532
the sooner we can get the Doctor out.
Now get going. Shift.

15:06.864 --> 15:10.585
We've got all this cable.
We might as well use it.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.879
The drum is disconnected.
We could adapt it.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.248
Feed it through.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.333
And then what?

15:17.417 --> 15:20.717
Abseil into the Pit.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.014
Abseil. Right.

15:23.172 --> 15:27.427
We're running out of air with no way back.
It's the only thing we can do,

15:27.510 --> 15:30.514
even if it's the last
thing we ever achieve.

15:31.055 --> 15:34.480
I'll get back. Rose is up there.

15:34.559 --> 15:38.530
Well, maybe the key to that
is finding out what's in the Pit.

15:39.522 --> 15:42.617
Well, it's half of a good plan.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.452
What's the other half?

15:44.527 --> 15:47.076
I go down, not you.

15:48.739 --> 15:53.040
Open junctions five, six, seven.

15:55.872 --> 15:59.422
Reroute filters 16 to 24. Go.

16:01.252 --> 16:04.131
There's all sorts of viruses
that could stop the Ood.

16:04.213 --> 16:07.137
Trouble is, we haven't got them on board.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.344
Well, that's handy,
listing things we haven't got.

16:09.427 --> 16:13.057
We haven't got a swimming pool either,
or a Tesco's.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.857
Oh, my God. It says yes! I can do it!

16:18.436 --> 16:21.280
Hypothetically, if you flip the monitor,

16:21.397 --> 16:25.152
broadcast a flare,
it can disrupt the telepathy. Brainstorm!

16:25.234 --> 16:28.613
- What happens to the Ood?
- It'll tank them, spark-out!

16:28.738 --> 16:31.082
There we are, then. Do it!

16:31.199 --> 16:32.746
I know, but...

16:33.618 --> 16:36.588
I'd have to transmit
from the central monitor.

16:36.704 --> 16:39.082
We need to go to Ood Habitation.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.636
That's what we'll do, then.

16:43.711 --> 16:47.056
- Mr Jefferson, sir, any way out?
- Just about.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.097
There's a network of maintenance tunnels
running underneath the base.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.178
We should be able to
gain access from here.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.683
Ventilation shafts.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.437
I appreciate the reference,
but there's no ventilation.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.434
No air, in fact, at all.

16:58.518 --> 17:02.022
They were designed for machines,
not life forms.

17:02.104 --> 17:05.324
But I can manipulate
the oxygen field from here,

17:05.441 --> 17:08.035
create discrete pockets of atmosphere.

17:08.109 --> 17:11.865
If I control it manually,
I can follow you through the network.

17:11.948 --> 17:16.704
Right. So we go down
and you make the air follow us by hand?

17:16.786 --> 17:18.538
You wanted me pressing buttons.

17:18.621 --> 17:22.592
Yep, I asked for it. Okay, we need to get
to Ood Habitation. Work out a route.

17:25.211 --> 17:28.464
That should hold it. How's it going?

17:28.589 --> 17:31.388
Fine. Should work.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.016
Doesn't feel like such a good idea now.

17:35.805 --> 17:39.355
Hmm. There it is again. That itch.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.606
Go down, go down, go down, go down!

17:41.727 --> 17:43.479
The urge to jump.

17:43.604 --> 17:46.528
Do you know where it comes from,
that sensation?

17:46.649 --> 17:51.746
Genetic heritage.
Ever since we were primates in the trees.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.449
It's our body's way of testing us,

17:54.532 --> 17:58.662
calculating whether or not
we can reach the next branch.

17:58.995 --> 18:03.171
No, that's not it. That's too kind.

18:04.375 --> 18:07.345
It's not the urge to jump.
It's deeper than that.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.846
It's the urge to fall.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.466
Doctor!

18:13.384 --> 18:15.887
- You okay?
- Not bad, thanks.

18:16.971 --> 18:20.100
The wall of the Pit seems to be
the same as the cavern,

18:20.182 --> 18:22.856
just not much of it.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.277
There's a crust about 20 feet down.

18:27.398 --> 18:28.945
And then...

18:29.817 --> 18:31.694
nothing, just the Pit.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.699
Okay, then. Lower me down.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.374
Well, here we go, then.

18:46.292 --> 18:49.466
- Danny!
- Hold on, just conforming.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.719
Danny, we've got to go now. Come on.

18:53.799 --> 18:54.971
There!

18:55.092 --> 18:58.312
Put that in the monitor
and it's a bad time to be an Ood!

18:58.387 --> 19:00.307
We're coming back.
We're coming back to this room

19:00.348 --> 19:01.941
and we're getting the Doctor out.

19:02.058 --> 19:05.983
Danny, you go first, then Miss Tyler, then Toby.
I'll go last in defensive position.

19:06.062 --> 19:09.157
Now come on, quick as you can!

19:11.734 --> 19:14.453
God, it stinks. You all right?

19:14.570 --> 19:17.244
Yeah, laughing. Which way do we go?

19:17.323 --> 19:19.826
Just go straight ahead.
Keep going till I say so.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.593
Not your best angle, Danny.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.171
Oi, stop it.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.096
- Don't know, could be worse.
- Oi!

19:34.423 --> 19:38.348
Straight on till you find junction 7.1.
Keep breathing.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.306
I'm feeding you air. I've got you.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.784
We're at 7.1, sir.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.740
Okay, I've got you.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.913
I'm just aerating the next section.

20:04.995 --> 20:08.374
Getting kind of cramped, sir.
Can't you hurry up?

20:08.457 --> 20:11.051
- I'm working on half power here.
- Stop complaining.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.425
- Mr Jefferson said stop complaining.
- I heard.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.802
- He heard.
- The air's getting a bit thin.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.384
- He's complaining now.
- I heard.

20:20.428 --> 20:23.432
- Danny, is that you?
- I'm not exactly happy.

20:23.514 --> 20:26.563
I'm just moving the air.
I've got to oxygenate the next section.

20:26.642 --> 20:30.192
Now, keep calm or it's gonna feel worse.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.535
- What was that?
- Mr Jefferson, what was that?

20:36.652 --> 20:39.531
- What was that noise?
- Captain, what was that?

20:39.822 --> 20:43.668
The junction in Habitation 5
has been opened. It must be the Ood.

20:44.118 --> 20:46.667
- They're in the tunnels.
- Open the gate.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.256
- I've got to get the air in!
Just open it; sir!

20:49.331 --> 20:52.881
- Where are they? Are they close?
- I can't tell. I can't see them.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.884
The computer doesn't register Ood
as proper life forms.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.427
Whose idea was that?

20:57.506 --> 20:59.008
Open the gate!

21:03.179 --> 21:05.932
Danny, turn left, immediate left!

21:09.643 --> 21:13.113
The Ood, sir, can't you trap them?
Cut off the air?

21:13.189 --> 21:15.567
Not without cutting off yours.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.785
Danny, turn right, go right.

21:21.864 --> 21:24.208
Go faster. They're gonna catch up.

21:25.576 --> 21:27.954
I'll maintain defensive position.

21:28.037 --> 21:31.541
- You can't stop!
- Miss Tyler, that's my job.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.467
You've got your task, now see to it.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.886
You heard what he said, now shift!

21:53.270 --> 21:56.194
8.2, open 8.2!

21:56.273 --> 21:58.696
Zack, open 8.2!

21:58.776 --> 22:01.325
- I've got to aerate it.
- Open it now!

22:01.403 --> 22:02.905
I'm trying!

22:04.740 --> 22:07.084
Danny, stop it. That's not helping!

22:07.743 --> 22:08.995
Zack, get it open!

22:09.078 --> 22:12.673
Jefferson, I've got to open 8.2
by closing 8.1.

22:12.748 --> 22:15.922
You've got to get past the junction,
now move!

22:16.836 --> 22:19.806
That's an order, now move!

22:23.676 --> 22:25.895
I'm gonna lose oxygen, Jefferson.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.189
I can't stop the automatics!

22:30.266 --> 22:33.110
That's it, come on, come on!

22:33.519 --> 22:36.864
Danny, turn left and head for 9.2.
That's the last one.

22:36.939 --> 22:40.113
Jefferson, you've got to move faster!

22:40.192 --> 22:41.409
<i>John! Move! Move!</i>

22:41.527 --> 22:44.326
- Mr Jefferson! Come on!
- Keep going!

22:50.578 --> 22:54.333
I regret to inform you,
sir, I was a bit slow.

22:55.416 --> 22:57.043
Not so fast these days.

22:57.126 --> 23:02.053
I can't open 8.1, John.
Not without losing air for the others.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.008
And quite right, too, sir.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.311
I think I bought them a little time.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.890
<i>There's nothing I can do, John-</i>

23:11.724 --> 23:14.694
- I'm sorry.
- You've done enough, sir.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.484
Made a very good captain
under the circumstances.

23:18.814 --> 23:23.445
Might I ask, if you can't add oxygen
to this section,

23:23.527 --> 23:26.406
can you speed up the process
of its removal?

23:26.488 --> 23:29.241
I don't understand. What do you mean?

23:29.325 --> 23:32.750
Well, if I might choose the manner
of my departure, sir,

23:33.996 --> 23:37.341
lack of air seems more
natural than, well...

23:39.001 --> 23:42.175
let's say, death by Ood.

23:42.713 --> 23:44.636
I'd appreciate it, sir.

23:45.549 --> 23:46.971
Godspeed, Mr Jefferson.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.020
Thank you, sir.

24:00.105 --> 24:05.157
Report.
Officer John Maynard Jefferson, PKD...

24:05.861 --> 24:08.956
deceased, with honours,

24:10.908 --> 24:13.127
43K 2.1.

24:13.202 --> 24:17.252
Zack, we're at the final junction.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.925
9.2.

24:21.377 --> 24:23.050
And, uh.

24:23.170 --> 24:27.220
If my respects could be on record,
he saved our lives.

24:27.800 --> 24:31.395
Noted. Opening 9.2.

24:35.057 --> 24:38.732
- Lower 9.2! Zack, lower it!
- Back, back, back!

24:38.811 --> 24:42.736
We can't go back.
Look, 8.2's sealed off. We're stuck!

24:43.565 --> 24:45.363
Come on! Up!

24:52.825 --> 24:55.078
Come on. Toby, come on!

24:57.913 --> 24:59.711
Toby, get out of there!

24:59.790 --> 25:02.088
Help me. Oh, my God! Help me!

25:07.715 --> 25:09.217
It's this way!

25:22.730 --> 25:24.323
Hurry UP!

25:27.276 --> 25:30.155
- Get it in.
- Danny, get it done.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.869
- Transmit!
- I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm getting it in...

25:32.948 --> 25:34.416
Stop them!

25:40.956 --> 25:43.550
Danny, get that thing transmitting.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.988
You did it! We did it!

26:09.318 --> 26:11.320
Yes! Oh, yes!

26:13.947 --> 26:17.167
Zack, we did it. The Ood are down!
Now we've got to get the Doctor.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.786
I'm on my way-

26:20.662 --> 26:22.790
You get representations
of the horned beast

26:22.873 --> 26:24.500
right across the universe,

26:24.625 --> 26:26.593
in the myths and legends
of a million worlds.

26:26.668 --> 26:30.298
Earth, Draconia, Vel Consadine.

26:31.006 --> 26:35.307
Daemos, the Kaled God of War.
It's the same image over and over again.

26:35.385 --> 26:39.640
Maybe that idea came from somewhere,

26:39.723 --> 26:41.521
bleeding through.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.862
A thought at the back
of every sentient mind.

26:44.978 --> 26:47.902
- Emanating from here?
- Could be.

26:47.981 --> 26:50.860
But if this is the original,

26:50.943 --> 26:52.661
does that make it real?

26:53.570 --> 26:56.039
Does that make it the actual Devil, though?

26:56.115 --> 26:58.664
Well, if that's what you want to believe.

26:58.742 --> 27:02.292
Maybe that's what the Devil is
in the end, an idea.

27:05.874 --> 27:07.342
That's it.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.212
That's all we've got.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.136
You getting any sort of read out?

27:13.215 --> 27:14.592
Nothing.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.016
Could be miles to go yet.

27:18.095 --> 27:22.350
Or it could be 30 feet.
There's no way of telling.

27:25.185 --> 27:26.732
I could survive 30 feet.

27:26.812 --> 27:29.907
Oh, no, you don't. I'm pulling you back up.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.158
What are you doing?

27:35.237 --> 27:38.582
You bring me back, we're just
gonna sit there and run out of air.

27:39.950 --> 27:42.419
- I've got to go down.
- But you can't.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.087
Doctor, you can't!

27:44.163 --> 27:46.257
Call it an act of faith.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.211
I don't want to die on my own.

27:52.588 --> 27:53.840
I kn ow.

27:59.511 --> 28:02.981
Doctor, are you there?
Doctor, Ida, can you hear me?

28:03.056 --> 28:04.478
The comms are still down.

28:04.558 --> 28:07.038
I can patch them through the central desk
and boost the signal.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.729
Just give me a minute.

28:13.275 --> 28:16.074
I didn't ask. Have you
got any sort of faith?

28:16.945 --> 28:18.618
Not really.

28:19.865 --> 28:23.335
I was brought up
Neo-Classic Congregational.

28:24.077 --> 28:26.171
Because of my mum, she was...

28:29.458 --> 28:30.801
My old mum.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.763
But, no, I never believed.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.558
Neo-Classics. Have they got a devil?

28:38.967 --> 28:41.186
No, not as such. just, um...

28:42.262 --> 28:44.481
the things that men do.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.479
Same thing in the end.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.435
What about you?

28:54.316 --> 28:58.696
I believe... I believe
I haven't seen everything, I don't know.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.910
It's funny, isn't it?

29:04.993 --> 29:07.416
The things you make up, the rules.

29:07.496 --> 29:10.670
If that thing had said it came
from beyond the universe, I'd believe it.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.093
But before the universe?

29:13.168 --> 29:14.761
Impossible.

29:16.421 --> 29:18.423
Doesn't fit my rule.

29:21.343 --> 29:24.187
Still, that's why I keep travelling.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.566
To be proved wrong.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.401
Thank you, Ida.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.192
Don't go!

29:36.858 --> 29:39.486
If they get back in touch...

29:39.569 --> 29:42.618
If you talk to Rose, just tell her...

29:50.497 --> 29:51.965
Tell her...

29:55.627 --> 29:57.174
Oh, she knows.

30:01.008 --> 30:05.013
Doctor, are you there?
Doctor, Ida, can you hear me?

30:06.054 --> 30:07.522
Are you there, Doctor?

30:07.597 --> 30:08.814
He's gone.

30:10.559 --> 30:12.482
What do you mean, he's gone?

30:13.270 --> 30:14.738
He fell...

30:15.439 --> 30:17.237
into the Pit.

30:18.608 --> 30:22.329
And I don't know how deep it is,
miles and miles and miles.

30:22.404 --> 30:24.077
What do you mean, he fell?

30:24.239 --> 30:26.116
I couldn't stop him.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.417
He said your name.

30:37.794 --> 30:38.920
I'm sorry.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.092
Ida?

30:46.011 --> 30:50.482
There's no way of reaching you.
No cable, no backup.

30:50.557 --> 30:54.528
You're ten miles down. We can't get there.

30:54.770 --> 30:57.114
You should see this place, Zack.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.779
It's beautiful.

31:07.115 --> 31:10.085
I wanted to discover things,

31:12.496 --> 31:14.169
and here I am.

31:14.247 --> 31:16.591
We've got to abandon the base.

31:16.666 --> 31:19.340
I'm declaring this mission unsafe.

31:19.419 --> 31:23.140
All we can do is make sure
no one ever comes here again.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.888
But we'll never find out what it was.

31:25.967 --> 31:28.595
- Well, maybe that's best.
- Yeah.

31:33.475 --> 31:35.648
- Officer Scott...
- It's all right.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.234
Just go.

31:41.358 --> 31:42.951
Good luck.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.323
And you.

31:50.117 --> 31:54.668
Danny, Toby, close down the feed-links.
Get the retrotopes online.

31:54.746 --> 31:58.046
Then get to the rocket
and strap yourselves in. We're leaving.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.918
I'm not going.

32:00.502 --> 32:02.049
Rose, there's space for you.

32:02.170 --> 32:06.391
No, I'm gonna wait for the Doctor,
just like he'd wait for me.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.688
I'm sorry, but he's dead.

32:13.014 --> 32:15.437
You don't know him.

32:15.517 --> 32:17.770
'Cause he's not.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.907
I'm telling you, he's not.

32:21.982 --> 32:25.236
And even if he was, how could I leave him

32:25.318 --> 32:27.537
all on his own, all the way down there?

32:27.612 --> 32:30.536
No, I'm... I'm gonna stay.

32:32.159 --> 32:34.127
Then I apologise for this.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.580
Danny, Toby, make her secure.

32:36.663 --> 32:40.759
No! No! No! Stop! No! Let me go!

32:40.834 --> 32:42.836
Get off me! I'm not leaving! No!

32:45.881 --> 32:49.977
I have lost too many people.
I am not leaving you behind.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.940
Let's get her on board.

32:58.602 --> 33:01.526
- Did that one just move?
- It's the telepathic field.

33:01.605 --> 33:05.326
- It's reasserting itself!
- Move it. Get to the rocket! Move!

33:26.379 --> 33:27.881
I'm breathing.

33:35.263 --> 33:37.686
Air cushion to support the fall.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.395
You can breathe down here, Ida.

33:41.478 --> 33:43.276
Can you hear me, Ida?

33:43.647 --> 33:46.867
Dislocating B clamp, C clamp.
Raising Blu-Nitro to maximum.

33:46.942 --> 33:50.196
- Toby, how's the Negapact feed-line?
- Clear, ready to go, sir.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.996
For God's sake, get us out of here!

33:52.113 --> 33:54.662
Captain, I think we're gonna have
a problem passenger.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.626
Keep an eye on her.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.295
- It's all right, Rose. We're safe.
- I'm not going anywhere!

33:59.412 --> 34:01.756
Get me out of this thing. Get me out!

34:01.831 --> 34:06.632
And liftoff!

34:20.308 --> 34:21.775
The rocket.

34:28.315 --> 34:30.534
Take me back to the planet.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.701
- Take me back!
- Or what?

34:34.489 --> 34:35.991
Or I'll shoot.

34:38.368 --> 34:41.496
Would you, though? Would you really?

34:41.705 --> 34:44.174
Is that what your Doctor would want?

34:51.214 --> 34:56.219
I'm sorry, but it's too late anyway.
Take a look outside. We can't turn back.

34:57.137 --> 35:00.687
This is what the Doctor would have wanted.
Isn't that right?

35:06.855 --> 35:10.029
History of some big battle.
Man against Beast.

35:10.150 --> 35:12.403
I don't know if you're getting this, Ida.
Hope so.

35:12.485 --> 35:16.490
Anyway, they defeated the Beast
and imprisoned it.

35:25.874 --> 35:28.218
And maybe that's the key.

35:35.925 --> 35:38.849
Or the gate or the bars.

36:02.535 --> 36:03.912
What's the joke?

36:04.037 --> 36:07.462
Just... We made it. We escaped.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.668
- We actually did it.
- Not all of us.

36:09.751 --> 36:11.674
We're not out of it yet.

36:11.753 --> 36:15.257
We're still the first people in history
to fly away from a black hole.

36:15.382 --> 36:17.259
Toby, read me the stats.

36:17.342 --> 36:21.688
Gravity funnel holding, sir.
Oh, it's holding.

36:21.763 --> 36:23.982
I accept that you exist.

36:25.308 --> 36:29.859
I don't have to accept what you are. But
your physical existence, I give you that.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.033
I don't understand.

36:34.109 --> 36:36.237
I was expected down here.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.114
I was given a safe landing and air.

36:40.073 --> 36:42.451
You need me for something. What for?

36:48.123 --> 36:50.046
Have I got to...

36:50.125 --> 36:54.221
I don't know, beg an audience or...
Is there a ritual?

36:54.295 --> 36:57.299
Some sort of incantation
or summons or spell?

36:57.382 --> 37:00.477
All these things I don't believe in,
are they real?

37:02.137 --> 37:04.481
Speak to me! Tell me!

37:08.309 --> 37:13.315
You won't talk or you can't talk.

37:16.443 --> 37:19.788
Hold on, hold on.
Wait a minute. just let me...

37:20.697 --> 37:24.167
Oh! No. Yes! No.

37:24.784 --> 37:28.129
Think it through.
You spoke before, I heard your voice.

37:28.204 --> 37:32.004
An intelligent voice.
No, more than that. Brilliant!

37:34.252 --> 37:38.723
But looking at you now, all I can see...

37:42.510 --> 37:45.639
is beast.

37:46.431 --> 37:49.776
The animal, just the body.

37:49.851 --> 37:52.070
You're just the body, the physical form.

37:52.145 --> 37:54.898
What's happened to your mind, hmm?

37:56.065 --> 38:00.161
Where's it gone? Where's that intelligence?

38:03.198 --> 38:05.121
Oh, no.

38:07.494 --> 38:12.421
Stats at 53. Funnel stable at 66.5.
Hull pressure constant.

38:13.041 --> 38:15.885
Smooth as we can, sir.
All the way back home.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.797
Coordinates set for planet Earth.

38:20.215 --> 38:23.014
You were imprisoned a long time ago.

38:24.052 --> 38:28.182
Before the universe, after, sideways,
in between, it doesn't matter.

38:28.264 --> 38:30.687
The prison is perfect.

38:30.767 --> 38:35.238
It's absolute. It's eternal. Oh, yes!

38:35.730 --> 38:39.576
Open the prison, the
gravity field collapses.

38:39.651 --> 38:42.404
This planet falls into the black hole.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.953
You escape, you die. Brilliant!

38:46.783 --> 38:51.505
But that's just the body.
The body is trapped, that's all.

38:53.122 --> 38:57.593
The Devil is an idea.
In all those civilisations, just an idea.

38:59.087 --> 39:02.637
But an idea is hard to kill.

39:02.799 --> 39:04.927
An idea can escape.

39:06.177 --> 39:11.354
The mind, the mind of the great Beast,
the mind can escape.

39:12.475 --> 39:16.571
Oh, but that's it!
You didn't give me air, your jailers did!

39:16.646 --> 39:20.571
They set this up all those years ago.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.994
They need me alive.

39:23.111 --> 39:26.786
Because if you're escaping,
then I've got to stop you!

39:32.370 --> 39:35.249
If I destroy your prison,
your body is destroyed,

39:35.331 --> 39:37.675
your mind with it.

39:45.550 --> 39:49.805
But then you're clever enough
to use this whole system against me.

39:51.264 --> 39:54.768
If I destroy this planet,
I destroy the gravity field.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.195
The rocket.

39:57.979 --> 40:01.654
The rocket loses protection,
falls into the black hole.

40:04.277 --> 40:06.405
I have to sacrifice Rose.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.088
It doesn't make sense.

40:16.998 --> 40:19.968
We escaped, but there's a thousand ways
it could have killed us.

40:20.043 --> 40:23.047
It could have ripped out the air

40:23.129 --> 40:25.632
or, I don't know, burnt us or anything.

40:25.715 --> 40:28.184
But it let us go. Why?

40:29.802 --> 40:33.181
- Unless it wanted us to escape.
- Hey, Rose, do us a favour.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.525
Shut up.

40:37.226 --> 40:42.027
Almost there. We're beyond the reach
of the black hole in 40, 39...

40:42.148 --> 40:44.025
So that's the trap

40:44.150 --> 40:46.994
or the test or the final judgement,
I don't know.

40:48.988 --> 40:51.616
But if I kill you, I kill her.

40:56.871 --> 40:59.624
Except that implies

40:59.707 --> 41:03.462
in this big, grand scheme
of gods and devils,

41:03.544 --> 41:05.546
that she is just a victim.

41:05.672 --> 41:08.391
But I've seen a lot of this universe.

41:08.466 --> 41:13.393
I've seen fake gods and bad gods
and demigods and would-be gods,

41:13.513 --> 41:17.734
and out of all that,
out of that whole pantheon,

41:17.809 --> 41:22.064
if I believe in one thing, just one thing,

41:23.731 --> 41:25.699
I believe in her.

41:30.738 --> 41:33.742
- What happened? What was that?
- What's he doing?

41:33.825 --> 41:37.329
- We've lost the funnel! Gravity collapse!
- What does that mean?

41:37.412 --> 41:40.666
We can't escape.
We're heading straight for the black hole.

41:51.092 --> 41:55.347
This is your freedom! Free to die!

41:55.430 --> 41:59.435
You're going into that black hole
and I'm riding with you!

42:04.897 --> 42:08.447
It's the planet. The planet's moving.

42:08.568 --> 42:10.366
It's falling.

42:11.821 --> 42:15.291
- I'm the rage and the bile and the ferocity!
- It's Toby!

42:15.408 --> 42:18.207
I am the prince and the fool and the agony!

42:18.286 --> 42:21.130
- I'm the sin and the fear and the darkness!
- It's him!

42:21.205 --> 42:25.836
Stay where you are. The ship's not stable.
What is he? What the hell is he?

42:29.464 --> 42:32.764
I shall never die!
The thought of me is forever.

42:32.842 --> 42:37.848
In the bleeding hearts of men,
in their vanity and obsession and lust!

42:37.972 --> 42:41.272
Nothing shall ever destroy me. Nothing.

42:41.350 --> 42:42.852
Go to hell.

42:54.489 --> 42:56.992
Emergency shield!

43:06.292 --> 43:10.092
We've still lost the gravity funnel.
We can't escape the black hole.

43:10.171 --> 43:13.095
But we stopped him.
That's what the Doctor would have done.

43:13.216 --> 43:15.264
Some victory.

43:15.510 --> 43:17.387
We're going in.

43:33.778 --> 43:37.703
The planet's lost orbit. It's falling!

44:04.851 --> 44:06.524
The planet's gone.

44:07.562 --> 44:09.735
- I'm sorry.
- Accelerate.

44:11.149 --> 44:12.742
I did my best.

44:13.734 --> 44:18.615
But, hey, the first human beings
to fall inside a black hole.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.083
How about that?

44:22.243 --> 44:23.745
History.

44:35.756 --> 44:37.429
What happened?

44:42.555 --> 44:44.432
We're turning.

44:45.600 --> 44:49.776
We're turning around. We're turning away!

44:51.397 --> 44:53.570
<i>Sony about the hijack, Captain.</i>

44:53.649 --> 44:56.027
This is the good ship Tardis.

44:56.110 --> 44:58.738
First things first,
have you got a Rose Tyler on board?

44:58.821 --> 45:03.418
I'm here! It's me! Oh, my God!
Where are you?

45:03.492 --> 45:06.371
I'm just towing you home.
Graviiy-shmavity.

45:06.495 --> 45:09.840
My people practically invented black holes.
Well, in fact, they did.

45:09.916 --> 45:14.968
Couple of minutes, we'll be nice and safe.
Oh, and Captain, can we do a swap?

45:15.087 --> 45:19.684
Say, if you give me Rose Tyler,
I'll give you Ida Scott. How about that?

45:19.759 --> 45:23.309
- She's alive!
- Yes. Thank you, God.

45:23.471 --> 45:26.520
Bit of oxygen starvation,
but she should be all right.

45:27.141 --> 45:29.360
I couldn't save the Ood.

45:29.435 --> 45:31.437
I only had time for one trip.

45:32.021 --> 45:34.194
They went down with the planet.

45:36.692 --> 45:39.696
Entering clear space. End of the line.

45:39.820 --> 45:41.697
Mission closed.

46:01.842 --> 46:05.472
I don't know. I can't remember.

46:05.680 --> 46:07.557
Well, it looked like a box.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.813
What do you mean, a box?

46:09.892 --> 46:13.897
Well, down in the hold, a big blue box.

46:14.021 --> 46:16.399
It just appeared. I don't know.

46:16.649 --> 46:20.904
Zack, we 'll be off now.
Have a good trip home.

46:21.529 --> 46:25.033
And the next time
you get curious about something...

46:25.825 --> 46:29.079
Oh, what's the point?
You’ll just go blundering in.

46:29.161 --> 46:30.253
The human race!

46:30.371 --> 46:33.500
But, Doctor, what did you find down there?

46:33.624 --> 46:35.376
That creature, what was it?

46:35.459 --> 46:39.089
I don't know.
Never did decipher that writing.

46:39.213 --> 46:40.465
But that's good.

46:40.548 --> 46:43.222
The day I know everything,
I might as well stop.

46:43.342 --> 46:46.095
What do you think it was, really?

46:46.178 --> 46:50.228
I think we beat it.
That's good enough for me.

46:50.308 --> 46:52.902
It said I was going to die in battle.

46:55.104 --> 46:56.606
Then it lied.

46:58.232 --> 47:02.112
Right! Onwards, upwards.
Ida, see you again maybe.

47:02.194 --> 47:03.411
I hope so.

47:03.529 --> 47:05.577
And thanks, boys!

47:05.656 --> 47:09.081
Hang on though, Doctor,
you never really said.

47:09.243 --> 47:12.543
You two, who are you?

47:12.621 --> 47:16.171
Oh, the stuff of legend.

47:19.837 --> 47:24.593
This is the final report
of Sanctuary Base 6.

47:24.800 --> 47:29.522
Officer Tobias Zed, deceased, with honours.

47:30.181 --> 47:33.105
43K 2.1.

47:33.434 --> 47:37.359
Also, Ood 1 Alpha 1,

47:37.438 --> 47:40.487
deceased, with honours.

47:40.566 --> 47:44.287
Ood 1 Alpha 2, deceased with honours...

47:52.286 --> 47:54.129
Lights!

47:55.498 --> 47:57.466
I am your salvation.

47:58.793 --> 48:00.841
The sound of the universe.

48:00.920 --> 48:02.593
What does it mean?

48:03.714 --> 48:06.137
- His name is the Doctor.
- Doctor what?

48:06.217 --> 48:08.140
Find me that girl!

48:09.678 --> 48:12.978
Here we are, complete strangers,
and I'm flashing you my knickers.

48:13.057 --> 48:15.810
One step closer to catching the Doctor.

48:15.976 --> 48:17.398
Don't I know you?
