<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill:

00:03.602 --> 00:06.265
I'm the one who did it.
I broke her windshield.

00:06.339 --> 00:08.899
When I got off the bus,
I saw Haley kissing some guy.

00:08.975 --> 00:12.934
He was kind of scrawny, had a guitar case,
sort of pelty hair.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.885
I took the test.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.781
We'll know in a couple of days.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.551
Thank you.

00:31.097 --> 00:32.997
I'm tired of running, Peyton.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.835
Come with me.
Let's bring Jenny back home.

00:38.071 --> 00:39.868
Something happened tonight.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.030
I asked her to marry me.

00:42.108 --> 00:44.975
You and I are the only ones
who know the truth about Jules.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.740
And I'm willing to keep it a secret.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.542
What do you want from me?

00:48.715 --> 00:50.876
I'm sure we can work something out.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

01:43.636 --> 01:48.096
-I think the Latin book's upside down.
-Like I could read it if it was right-side up.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.775
How long is it gonna take you
to get these fliers done?

01:51.845 --> 01:53.938
Just gotta download the pics
to my computer.

01:54.013 --> 01:57.471
-You got a slogan in mind?
-Yeah. ''Brooke Davis for President.''

01:57.784 --> 02:00.480
Short enough for even
the stoners to remember.

02:06.659 --> 02:10.026
-You gonna leave Keith and Jules alone?
-I'm thinking about it.

02:10.295 --> 02:14.255
Keith's happy for once.
He's getting married. Don't screw that up.

02:15.468 --> 02:17.163
They're getting married?

02:20.039 --> 02:22.405
I'll tell you what. I'll leave them alone...

02:22.775 --> 02:25.539
if you give me a chance to prove
I can be a good father.

02:25.612 --> 02:28.706
How you gonna do that? I get a lobotomy?

02:29.349 --> 02:30.338
No.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.808
You move in with me.

02:42.896 --> 02:46.559
Haley, we seriously have to hide
the matches from your pyro sister.

02:46.933 --> 02:50.733
Be grateful it's just candles. When
we were kids, I set fire to our bunk beds.

02:51.471 --> 02:54.440
Where is Haley, and does she know
that you're wearing her shirt?

02:54.507 --> 02:57.499
At school. And no.
I needed a beach cover-up.

02:57.844 --> 03:01.075
I borrowed some cash for beer.
I hope you don't mind.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.818
And she left the computer on.

03:08.588 --> 03:11.148
Love having you, Taylor.
Come visit anytime.

03:31.010 --> 03:34.377
Hey, Luke. I'm taking a poll
for the next issue of the paper.

03:34.714 --> 03:38.275
What is your biggest concern for the
upcoming student government election?

03:38.351 --> 03:39.909
Having to answer polls.

03:39.986 --> 03:43.353
If it isn't my favorite two voters
in the same place.

03:43.656 --> 03:46.591
You two can be the first to know
I'm running for president.

03:46.659 --> 03:49.253
-Do I have your support?
-Do I have any choice?

03:49.329 --> 03:50.990
Let me think about that. No.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.362
If you're doing your newspaper gig,
Mighty Mouth...

03:53.433 --> 03:55.924
I'll give you an exclusive on my campaign.

03:56.336 --> 03:58.497
-Yeah. We should set that up.
-Good.

03:59.606 --> 04:02.734
-Have you guys seen Haley?
-I think she's tutoring.

04:03.509 --> 04:05.306
-You okay?
-I gotta go.

04:07.146 --> 04:08.909
-AII right.
-No way.

04:09.549 --> 04:11.039
-Is that Jake?
-What?

04:13.386 --> 04:14.375
Hey.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.418
-When did you get back?
-A couple days ago.

04:17.490 --> 04:18.548
How's Jenny?

04:18.625 --> 04:19.683
-Hey.
-Hi.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.284
She's great.
She's getting bigger every day.

04:22.595 --> 04:26.122
You're getting scrawny.
Better hit that weight-room before camp.

04:26.399 --> 04:29.766
-Will you still be here then?
-Yeah. I'm back for good now.

04:29.836 --> 04:31.428
I've got some messes to clean up.

04:31.504 --> 04:34.473
I gotta get a lawyer
to see if I can keep Nicki away.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.132
But I'm done running.

04:36.743 --> 04:40.611
-Good. We need you here.
-Thanks.

04:42.448 --> 04:46.145
Jake, I'm so glad you came back.
You can still vote here, right?

04:47.553 --> 04:49.316
-You good?
-Yes.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.386
Thank you for calling him.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.757
You're a good friend, Luke.

05:04.504 --> 05:07.905
Hey. I heard you were out of town.
Fill me in on all the dirt.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.374
I think you're the only one who has any.

05:12.211 --> 05:14.372
-I have to ask you something.
-Yeah.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.348
Did you kiss Chris?

05:21.921 --> 05:23.752
How did you know about that?

05:24.123 --> 05:25.818
That is seriously not important.

05:25.892 --> 05:28.360
-It was like a goodbye kiss.
-With tongue?

05:29.762 --> 05:31.753
Haley, what's going on with you?

05:31.831 --> 05:35.232
You know how ugly everything got
with me and Brooke and Lucas.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.598
There were no wedding rings
in that scenario.

05:37.670 --> 05:41.128
Look, he just. He just kissed me.

05:42.608 --> 05:45.839
And I let him.
And it was a really stupid thing to do.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.068
But...

05:47.980 --> 05:50.107
it didn't mean anything, you know.

05:52.251 --> 05:54.185
A kiss always means something.

06:08.134 --> 06:11.900
I never thought I'd see you
darken my door again, Jaglieski.

06:12.338 --> 06:14.602
Yeah, I wasn't so sure myself, Coach.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.834
Where the hell have you been, son?

06:18.144 --> 06:20.942
Just looking for a safe place
in an unsafe world.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.571
-Did you find it?
-I don't think it exists.

06:24.450 --> 06:27.010
So I figured I'd just have
to create it myself.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.685
How's your game?

06:30.256 --> 06:32.417
I haven't had much cause to use it.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.819
How about your grades?

06:36.162 --> 06:39.461
I've been working a lot of hours
just to keep me and Jenny afloat.

06:39.532 --> 06:43.263
-So, I sort of stopped going to school.
-That's a damn fool plan.

06:44.737 --> 06:48.400
Jenny deserves a whole lot better
than a high-school dropout for a father.

06:48.474 --> 06:49.839
I know. That's why I'm here.

06:49.909 --> 06:54.141
I was hoping that you could speak to
Principal Turner on my behalf because...

06:54.313 --> 06:56.941
he wasn't really happy
the last time I talked to him.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.776
-You gonna disappear again?
-I don't plan on it, Coach.

07:04.357 --> 07:08.589
We've got a faculty meeting tonight.
I'll corner Turner and see what I can do.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.327
I appreciate that.

07:10.496 --> 07:12.794
About that safe place you're building.

07:13.499 --> 07:14.898
Don't do it alone.

07:15.568 --> 07:18.093
There's a lot of people here ready to help.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.576
You talk to your folks lately?

07:28.648 --> 07:30.775
Yeah, actually
my mom sent me an e-mail...

07:30.850 --> 07:32.841
said Daddy's dragging them
all over Wisconsin...

07:32.919 --> 07:35.581
looking for, like,
the Gouda Museum or something.

07:35.655 --> 07:37.020
What about Chris?

07:38.391 --> 07:40.291
Did you go through my e-mails?

07:40.860 --> 07:42.054
What is this, Haley?

07:42.128 --> 07:45.495
Nothing. I sent him one e-mail
to say good luck on your music.

07:45.698 --> 07:48.098
It looks like more than one e-mail to me.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.660
Taylor must've sent these
on my account because....

07:51.737 --> 07:54.205
Look at the dates.
They all start after she got here.

07:54.273 --> 07:56.901
And this one was sent
when I was at the cafe.

07:57.109 --> 07:58.838
So you didn't kiss Chris?

07:59.946 --> 08:02.676
Taylor is just stirring up trouble.
Like always.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.238
Okay.

08:05.284 --> 08:08.253
I'm gonna tell her to leave then.
That cool with you?

08:10.623 --> 08:12.454
Yeah. She should go.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.892
Good afternoon, folks.

08:24.470 --> 08:27.769
Welcome to the first
student government information session.

08:28.107 --> 08:31.599
I'm gonna pass out these sign-up sheets
for the various offices...

08:31.777 --> 08:35.371
and once you fill these out,
we'll talk about scheduling.

08:36.381 --> 08:38.350
Hi. Erica Marsh.

08:39.251 --> 08:41.777
I never pegged Brooke Davis
for student government.

08:41.854 --> 08:45.847
I am captain of the cheerleading squad
and a former homecoming queen.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.153
It can't be that different?

08:47.226 --> 08:50.923
Actually, government is a lot more
than a just a popularity contest.

08:50.997 --> 08:55.331
Everybody in this room has at least
a 3.8 GPA and a ton of outside interests.

08:55.401 --> 08:58.063
Take me. I'm president of
the National Honor Society...

08:58.137 --> 09:01.072
head of the French Club,
and co-chair of Tree Hill Big Sisters.

09:01.140 --> 09:05.440
Wow. You do all of that and yet you
still have time to talk to us little people.

09:05.511 --> 09:06.944
Maybe I can help you, Brooke.

09:07.013 --> 09:09.004
Have you thought about
running for secretary?

09:09.081 --> 09:10.844
Nobody serious ever wants that job.

09:10.917 --> 09:14.409
-Actually, I'm running for president.
-President?

09:15.054 --> 09:17.682
-I've been president since 7th grade.
-Really?

09:18.291 --> 09:20.759
-What was your name again?
-Erica Marsh.

09:22.094 --> 09:25.530
-No, doesn't ring a bell.
-Don't worry. It will.

09:26.632 --> 09:29.430
-Game on, Vivica.
-Erica.

09:30.336 --> 09:31.325
Whatever.

09:40.179 --> 09:42.739
-Hey.
-Hey. You're a lifesaver.

09:43.382 --> 09:46.215
Deb's out of town,
and I'm backed up on deliveries.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.020
Okay. No problem. I'll pack up the car.

09:49.388 --> 09:52.255
But first. The test results came.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.326
I don't have HCM. Keith's okay, too.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.596
Thank God.

09:59.365 --> 10:02.766
I don't think I could take it
if anything were wrong with you.

10:02.935 --> 10:03.924
I know.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.563
We should celebrate. Anything you want.

10:08.174 --> 10:10.938
-I want to move in with Dan.
-Right.

10:11.010 --> 10:13.638
And I want to drive metal spikes
into my eyes.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.880
Look, I know it sounds crazy, okay.

10:18.951 --> 10:22.614
-But college is gonna start in a few years--
-You're serious?

10:24.490 --> 10:25.479
Yeah.

10:27.360 --> 10:31.091
-I want to move in with Dan.
-Over my dead body.

10:32.264 --> 10:35.028
What's this really about, Lucas?
What's going on?

10:35.101 --> 10:36.090
Nothing.

10:37.536 --> 10:41.063
I know this comes as a surprise to you,
and I'm sorry, Mom...

10:41.140 --> 10:44.371
but it's what I want, okay?

10:52.852 --> 10:56.618
-You're late. Where the hell were you?
-I stopped by to check on Jules.

10:56.689 --> 10:59.385
You should have called.
Your office. Right now.

11:04.130 --> 11:05.461
Surprise.

11:07.299 --> 11:09.199
Congratulations, big brother.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.202
I hope Jules makes you as happy
as Deb has made me.

11:12.838 --> 11:16.239
-How did you know?
-Good news travels fast in this town.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.533
A toast. To Keith and to Jules.

11:18.744 --> 11:21.042
Two people lucky enough
to find each other.

11:21.113 --> 11:24.776
And I hope your lives together
are filled with many more surprises.

11:25.284 --> 11:28.981
This is just about the number of people
we're inviting to the wedding, so....

11:29.055 --> 11:30.420
What are you talking about?

11:30.489 --> 11:32.787
You know,
we're just gonna do something small.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.053
Out of the question.
You deserve a big blowout.

11:35.127 --> 11:36.685
No expense spared. It's my gift.

11:36.762 --> 11:39.856
I wanna give you a day
you'll remember for the rest of your life.

11:39.932 --> 11:41.661
Besides, it's not for you.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.165
It's for Jules.

11:44.236 --> 11:46.932
Every woman deserves to be
a queen for the day.

11:48.407 --> 11:51.171
-What the hell are you doing with Lucas?
-So he told you?

11:51.243 --> 11:53.711
Only he's moving in with you.
Not the real reason why.

11:53.779 --> 11:56.942
-He wants to get to know his father.
-That's crap, and we both know it.

11:57.016 --> 12:00.008
-You're manipulating him somehow.
-I'm letting him make a choice.

12:00.086 --> 12:03.180
He's a big boy, Karen. He needs
something more than just his mommy.

12:03.255 --> 12:06.850
Don't you dare walk away from me.
We are nowhere near finished....

12:09.562 --> 12:10.756
What's going on?

12:10.830 --> 12:13.731
It's a little party
to celebrate Keith's engagement.

12:16.602 --> 12:17.694
Champagne?

12:21.240 --> 12:22.229
Hey.

12:24.376 --> 12:25.365
Hey.

12:25.511 --> 12:28.571
So, Nathan found out that I kissed Chris.

12:28.647 --> 12:29.739
-You told him?
-No.

12:29.815 --> 12:32.841
My idiot sister has been e-mailing Chris
under my screen name...

12:32.918 --> 12:35.011
because the drama
in her own life isn't enough.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.419
-And Nathan found the e-mails.
-How'd he take it?

12:37.490 --> 12:39.617
I just told him Taylor made it all up.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.819
So you lied to him again?

12:43.028 --> 12:46.259
Yeah. And I felt awful about it.
What's the point of telling Nathan?

12:46.332 --> 12:48.800
Chris is out of my life, okay?

12:49.135 --> 12:51.695
Nathan would feel worse
if he knew the truth.

12:52.738 --> 12:54.137
What is the truth?

12:55.074 --> 12:58.043
That Chris and I
are connected through music.

12:59.211 --> 13:02.203
He understands that part of me
in a way that Nathan doesn't.

13:02.281 --> 13:07.014
Okay, Haley, if Chris were in town
would you be into him?

13:07.086 --> 13:08.781
Because, I mean, you kissed him.

13:08.854 --> 13:11.186
I know I kissed him, and it was a mistake.

13:11.257 --> 13:15.819
-This whole connection is strictly music?
-That's all it is. I love Nathan.

13:24.837 --> 13:27.203
So I guess congratulations are in order.

13:27.273 --> 13:31.073
I'm sorry about this morning.
That's not how I wanted you to find out.

13:31.443 --> 13:33.274
Why didn't you just tell me?

13:33.546 --> 13:36.344
You know,
for as long as I can remember, Karen...

13:37.116 --> 13:39.914
I wanted to be with you.
And then I proposed.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.852
-Keith.
-No, really. It's okay.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.485
When you turned me down...

13:46.792 --> 13:49.352
I thought I'd never have
any love in my life.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.196
But now I've found the love of my life.

13:56.068 --> 13:57.695
Jules is a lucky woman.

13:58.137 --> 14:02.767
I guess I didn't tell you because
I needed to say this first.

14:04.710 --> 14:08.874
I'm glad I loved you all those years,
you know, even if it didn't work out.

14:10.349 --> 14:14.251
My heart knew what it wanted.
So I was ready when Jules came along.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.021
Did you guys set a date yet?

14:20.960 --> 14:22.860
No. It'll be soon, though.

14:23.896 --> 14:26.057
Lucas has already agreed
to be my best man.

14:26.131 --> 14:28.156
Really? I didn't know.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.297
We haven't talked about anything but Dan
since Lucas asked to move in with him.

14:33.672 --> 14:34.900
Hang on, what?

14:34.974 --> 14:37.875
There's something going on
that he's not telling me.

14:42.781 --> 14:44.806
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:45.284 --> 14:46.876
Like my new campaign posters?

14:46.952 --> 14:49.785
-I have never seen you looking so--
-Presidential?

14:50.155 --> 14:51.144
Funereal.

14:51.824 --> 14:55.954
Funny word coming from you,
Miss Happy-Goofy-Grin-Queen.

14:56.428 --> 14:59.454
-What's going on with you and Jake?
-I don't know. Stop.

14:59.531 --> 15:02.591
-We're playing it by ear.
-Is that all you're playing?

15:04.270 --> 15:08.934
Fine. Don't tell us. I'll just keep my fingers
crossed and expect juicy details later.

15:15.881 --> 15:17.109
Who did that?

15:17.549 --> 15:20.882
<i>ln our great democracy,</i>
<i>anyone can run for president.</i>

15:21.220 --> 15:23.484
<i>But you deserve a leader you can trust.</i>

15:23.555 --> 15:26.319
<i>I have evidence that Brooke Davis</i>
<i>stuffed the ballot box...</i>

15:26.392 --> 15:28.087
<i>to win homecoming queen.</i>

15:30.296 --> 15:33.663
I knocked it over by accident.
I was just putting the ballots back in.

15:33.732 --> 15:35.996
<i>And that might not be all she stuffs.</i>

15:38.003 --> 15:40.733
Please. I haven't stuffed since puberty.

15:40.806 --> 15:43.400
I can't believe
that little bitch went negative.

15:43.475 --> 15:45.466
I can't believe she beat you to it.

15:45.544 --> 15:49.947
<i>This election, choose honesty.</i>
<i>Vote for me, Erica Marsh.</i>

15:59.325 --> 16:03.421
-Little frosty in here today, no?
-You here to eat or give a weather report?

16:04.863 --> 16:06.490
Okay, what's going on?

16:06.565 --> 16:09.398
I thought Lucas took the HCM test
and was fine.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.629
Yeah, but now
he wants to move in with Dan.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.832
I haven't been able to get him to budge,
so I'm gonna get Keith to try.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.273
-Keith?
-Who's getting married to Jules.

16:18.043 --> 16:19.271
Wow, that's great.

16:19.345 --> 16:22.007
Is it? I mean,
how well does he know this girl?

16:22.081 --> 16:25.016
What if he's just blinded
by a pretty face and a hot body?

16:25.084 --> 16:27.484
Some would say the same about you.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.817
You can't let Erica get away
with smearing you like that.

16:32.891 --> 16:35.587
You leave this unanswered,
it becomes the truth.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.730
So, what do you think I should do
about Erica's ads?

16:40.632 --> 16:43.157
-Are they true?
-Some of them.

16:43.435 --> 16:46.666
Don't deny it. Politicians
always get caught when they lie.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.537
That's brilliant, genius.
Stick to slinging hash.

16:51.210 --> 16:54.441
Look, people like you, Brooke.
Just be who you are.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.678
Okay, it's official.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.411
Michelle Branch and Jessica Harp
are playing at Tric tomorrow.

16:59.485 --> 17:00.474
-No way.
-Yes.

17:00.552 --> 17:01.849
That's awesome.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.580
That will be perfect
for my campaign launch party.

17:04.656 --> 17:07.284
Yeah. Wait. What?

17:10.695 --> 17:12.823
Hey. Can you zip me up, brother?

17:15.733 --> 17:19.226
-You're busted, Taylor.
-I'll take that for a no.

17:20.939 --> 17:22.736
Where the hell have you been?

17:22.808 --> 17:26.471
I met some people at the beach and we
partied all night. What's your problem?

17:26.545 --> 17:29.412
I know you pretended to be Haley
and e-mailed Chris.

17:30.315 --> 17:33.148
What kind of a sister
does something that twisted?

17:33.218 --> 17:36.847
The kind who's hoping the baby
of the family doesn't screw up like she did.

17:36.922 --> 17:40.085
Right. Is that why you made up
all that stuff about a kiss?

17:40.159 --> 17:41.786
You think I made it up?

17:42.694 --> 17:45.162
I talked to Haley. There was no kiss.

17:46.598 --> 17:49.465
Make whatever phone calls you need
to find a place to crash.

17:49.535 --> 17:51.002
You're out of here.

18:02.848 --> 18:06.079
I was beginning to think
you'd skipped town and left all your stuff.

18:06.151 --> 18:09.245
What do you care if I haven't been around?
You're kicking me out.

18:09.321 --> 18:12.256
Drop the attitude, Tay.
You know you brought this on yourself.

18:12.324 --> 18:16.090
You've pulled a lot of crap over the years.
But e-mailing Chris as me....

18:16.261 --> 18:19.059
I can't believe you'd be
such a conniving little bitch.

18:19.131 --> 18:22.464
Hey. You're the bitch who's kissing a guy
who isn't your husband.

18:22.534 --> 18:25.469
You need a scapegoat.
Let Nathan think that this is all on me.

18:25.537 --> 18:27.402
But you and I both know
the kiss happened.

18:27.473 --> 18:30.067
Hey. Have a bear claw, brother.

18:30.542 --> 18:32.908
We're celebrating. I'm leaving tonight.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.112
Upgrade. I'm Dan.

18:43.722 --> 18:46.020
-And I'm out of your league.
-Wanna bet?

18:46.558 --> 18:49.686
-What are you doing here?
-That's the last of your stuff.

18:49.761 --> 18:51.854
I need to make some room.
Lucas is moving in.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.194
-Lucas is moving in with you?
-Yeah.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.628
Guess I'm not the devil after all.
Enjoy your breakfast.

19:07.713 --> 19:10.181
Are you implying that I cheat for my 4.0?

19:10.382 --> 19:14.648
Absolutely not. Just like you weren't
implying that I have a double-digit I.Q.

19:23.128 --> 19:24.720
-Hey.
-Hey, Nate.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.455
What's going on, man?

19:27.900 --> 19:30.164
It's true you're moving in with Dan?

19:30.969 --> 19:32.800
-Yeah.
-Great.

19:33.138 --> 19:35.936
What happened to
''He can't make me a substitute Nathan''?

19:36.008 --> 19:39.136
-It's more complicated than that.
-Whatever, man.

19:39.811 --> 19:42.006
Lucas. Hey.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.538
I've to write a killer platform speech
if I'm gonna win this election...

19:45.617 --> 19:48.518
-but I have no idea where to start.
-Why don't you ask Felix?

19:48.587 --> 19:51.385
Because Whitey told us to read
speeches by world leaders...

19:51.456 --> 19:53.890
then he mentioned this
Charles de Gaulle guy who...

19:53.959 --> 19:57.690
I thought was that exchange student
that's always smelling his fingers in class.

19:57.763 --> 20:00.994
So obviously this is
your area of expertise and not mine.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.965
Will you help me?

20:04.536 --> 20:06.731
How about tonight right before Tric?

20:07.306 --> 20:09.433
You're the best, Lucas. Thank you.

20:09.575 --> 20:13.978
Maybe I should do a contest.
You know, vote for me and win a date...

20:14.046 --> 20:15.707
or offer a makeover.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.777
You don't need a gimmick, Brooke.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.050
Just...

20:24.523 --> 20:26.582
tell me why you want to be president.

20:26.658 --> 20:29.923
I am who I am. No excuses.

20:31.930 --> 20:36.196
But I'd like people to know there's
a lot more to me than just some party girl.

20:43.542 --> 20:46.010
This is from a speech by John F. Kennedy.

20:47.479 --> 20:51.813
-I think it could work for you.
-This is all about courage.

20:54.286 --> 20:56.754
Nobody's gonna believe this
coming from me.

20:59.191 --> 21:00.180
I would.

21:09.201 --> 21:11.897
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.703
I brought you some campaign buttons.

21:16.541 --> 21:19.032
Wow. Thanks, Felix. These look great.

21:20.579 --> 21:23.047
You wanted me to pick you up before Tric.

21:23.949 --> 21:27.476
Is it that late already?
I totally lost track of time.

21:28.553 --> 21:29.952
We're done anyway.

21:36.161 --> 21:40.188
Everything you need to say
is already in your heart.

21:51.376 --> 21:54.504
We're gonna go out to Tric.
You gonna be here when we get back?

21:54.579 --> 21:56.479
No, my ride's coming tonight.

21:57.349 --> 21:58.839
Where are you gonna go?

21:58.917 --> 22:01.511
I met some guy who's starting
a surf shop down in the Keys.

22:01.586 --> 22:02.814
I'll crash there for a while.

22:02.888 --> 22:05.152
-And then what?
-I don't think that far ahead.

22:05.223 --> 22:06.315
Maybe you should.

22:06.391 --> 22:09.019
Like, having a plan
has worked so well for you.

22:12.931 --> 22:17.766
Listen, it's not much but here.

22:18.370 --> 22:21.237
It's all I've got. I want you to have it.

22:25.777 --> 22:26.766
Thanks.

22:28.647 --> 22:31.810
But this won't make you feel
any less guilty about Chris.

22:37.122 --> 22:39.682
Are you kidding me? D.J. Bobo?

22:39.958 --> 22:43.052
Where are the X-ecutioners
or the Chemical Brothers or anything?

22:43.128 --> 22:45.995
Peyton. The D.J.
has got this under control, okay.

22:46.064 --> 22:47.895
The night's gonna be great. Come on.

22:47.966 --> 22:49.729
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:49.801 --> 22:51.063
Welcome back.

22:51.136 --> 22:54.071
-Where's Nathan?
-Karen needed help with some boxes.

22:54.539 --> 22:58.168
I'll go help him out.
I've been wanting to say hi to Karen, so.

22:58.243 --> 22:59.733
Good to see you.

22:59.978 --> 23:01.275
-Hi.
-Hi.

23:02.147 --> 23:06.277
Okay, this is gonna sound really weird
and groupie, I'm a Michelle Branch fan.

23:06.351 --> 23:09.650
-I was wondering if you'd introduce me.
-I will introduce you.

23:16.828 --> 23:19.092
-Hey, guys. I'm sorry.
-Hey.

23:19.197 --> 23:21.062
I wanted to introduce you to my friend.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.601
Michelle Branch, Jessica Harp,
this is Haley.

23:23.668 --> 23:25.795
-Haley James?
-Haley James-Scott, actually.

23:25.871 --> 23:28.066
You know what?
We've heard a lot about you.

23:28.140 --> 23:29.971
I don't think that's possible.

23:30.041 --> 23:33.477
No, our opening act
gave you rave reviews. Didn't you?

23:33.879 --> 23:35.369
I said she was okay.

23:47.159 --> 23:51.994
-So you're the opening act?
-Not for long. I'll be headlining soon.

23:52.664 --> 23:56.361
So, Haley, Chris played us your duet,
and it sounds really great.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.871
-You should join him on stage tonight.
-Thanks.

24:00.038 --> 24:01.471
I don't think....

24:02.741 --> 24:06.177
I'm gotta head out,
but it was really nice to meet you guys.

24:08.313 --> 24:09.905
Nice to meet you, too.

24:15.020 --> 24:18.581
-What the hell are you doing?
-Giving you the biggest break of your life.

24:18.657 --> 24:21.888
-You're welcome.
-No. You did not do me any favors, okay?

24:21.960 --> 24:23.518
I'm busted my ass to get them here.

24:23.595 --> 24:25.620
-Yeah, but I sealed the deal.
-Why?

24:25.697 --> 24:29.224
So you could see Haley?
I know that you kissed her.

24:30.435 --> 24:34.303
Listen, it takes two, Curly, okay?
She didn't exactly push me away.

24:36.508 --> 24:39.341
You're wasting your time, you know.
She's over you.

24:40.345 --> 24:42.711
Then you've got nothing to worry about.

24:42.848 --> 24:43.872
<i>Hey, you guys.</i>

24:43.949 --> 24:46.884
<i>Thanks a lot for coming out tonight</i>
<i>to check out the Wreckers.</i>

24:46.952 --> 24:49.648
<i>We've got a lot of great music</i>
<i>coming your way.</i>

24:49.721 --> 24:52.781
<i>And we also have Chris Keller.</i>

25:00.565 --> 25:04.331
-What's he doing here?
-I didn't know he was coming, I swear.

25:05.971 --> 25:09.566
You guys still aren't ready for this.
But I'm in a forgiving mood.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.238
This one's for you, Haley.

25:30.061 --> 25:32.154
Have you told Brooke
about the windshield?

25:32.230 --> 25:33.959
I'm working up to it.

25:36.668 --> 25:37.828
Vote for me.

26:28.453 --> 26:31.445
-Maybe we should go.
-No. I'm gonna waste that guy.

26:34.993 --> 26:38.053
-I thought you weren't coming.
-My ride's running late.

26:38.964 --> 26:41.489
-Who's the stud?
-Chris.

26:45.303 --> 26:47.703
This evening just got interesting.

27:14.032 --> 27:16.933
<i>Thanks a lot, guys.</i>
<i>You've been acceptable.</i>

27:17.969 --> 27:19.698
<i>The Wreckers are up next.</i>

27:27.479 --> 27:28.912
Looking for an autograph?

27:28.980 --> 27:31.540
No. Actually,
I was looking to kick your ass.

27:32.283 --> 27:36.879
But then I realized, why bother?
There's nothing here for you.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.788
Haley sees what you really are.
A pathetic poser.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.594
I just wanted to let you know.

27:45.263 --> 27:46.491
You're wrong.

27:47.098 --> 27:50.329
You're just trying to silence
that voice inside your head.

27:50.402 --> 27:53.838
Yeah, you know the one.
It's growing louder every day.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.966
It's saying ''We're drifting apart.
I'm losing her.''

27:57.042 --> 28:00.034
Actually, it's saying ''Shut this guy up
once and for all.''

28:00.111 --> 28:03.274
Okay. Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe she does love you.

28:03.782 --> 28:04.771
She does.

28:05.450 --> 28:07.179
What if that's not enough?

28:12.123 --> 28:14.648
<i>Okay, you guys. The wait is over.</i>

28:14.726 --> 28:16.853
<i>Please join me in welcoming to Tric...</i>

28:16.928 --> 28:21.865
<i>Maverick recording artists Michelle Branch</i>
<i>and Jessica Harp. The Wreckers.</i>

28:27.072 --> 28:30.439
<i>Hey, thanks, you guys.</i>
<i>It's so great to be here in Tree Hill.</i>

28:32.844 --> 28:35.039
<i>And vote for Brooke.</i>

30:08.406 --> 30:09.395
Hey.

30:12.277 --> 30:16.577
I have a confession to make.
I'm jealous of Jules.

30:19.784 --> 30:22.912
Every since I had Lucas, before that even...

30:23.388 --> 30:25.879
you've been the one person
I could count on.

30:26.991 --> 30:29.084
It's gonna be hard to lose that.

30:29.527 --> 30:30.516
Karen...

30:32.197 --> 30:35.462
we'll still be in each other's lives.
That'll never change.

30:35.900 --> 30:36.889
I know.

30:38.002 --> 30:40.493
It's just taking some getting used to.

31:04.863 --> 31:05.852
Hey.

31:11.970 --> 31:15.872
-You played a really great set.
-Yeah, I know.

31:19.744 --> 31:21.143
AII right...

31:23.214 --> 31:24.306
good luck.

31:25.283 --> 31:27.547
You want to know about it, don't you?

31:28.653 --> 31:32.089
The tour, the music,
it's all happening for me now.

31:35.260 --> 31:38.320
-I could still happen for you, Haley.
-It will someday.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.155
Someday's here.

31:40.498 --> 31:43.023
I talked to Michelle.
She wants you on the tour.

31:43.101 --> 31:46.537
-What?
-People love the duet. It's real.

31:47.105 --> 31:50.700
Jessica started off as Michelle's
back-up singer. Look at her now.

31:50.842 --> 31:54.778
The difference between wannabes
and successes is grabbing opportunity.

31:55.480 --> 31:59.314
Our tour bus leaves in a couple hours,
and you know you should be on it.

32:00.418 --> 32:01.783
You brave enough?

32:15.566 --> 32:19.559
Now that Taylor's leaving we'll have
enough hot water for our own showers.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.247
Haley, what's wrong?

32:37.121 --> 32:40.488
Michelle Branch likes my voice.
She thinks I could be a singer.

32:40.625 --> 32:41.717
A real one.

32:45.063 --> 32:47.088
Chris said that she wants me on tour.

32:47.198 --> 32:50.395
I'm so far ahead with classes
and I'd be back in time for finals.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.163
So says the great Chris.

32:52.437 --> 32:56.032
No, this isn't about him, Nathan.
This is about opportunity.

32:56.240 --> 33:00.006
I have my entire life been the reliable one,
and the dependable one.

33:00.078 --> 33:03.411
And I have always done precisely
what's expected of me.

33:03.481 --> 33:04.709
Until we got married.

33:04.782 --> 33:07.580
Exactly. And then
I finally did something for me.

33:07.952 --> 33:11.752
Something that I wanted.
And the world didn't end.

33:14.158 --> 33:16.058
And I have that chance again.

33:18.096 --> 33:21.190
-If you leave me--
-This is not the end for us.

33:22.500 --> 33:26.436
This is my shot to find out
if I am good enough to have a life in music.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.166
Or if nights at Tric are all I get.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.972
And this has nothing to do with Chris?

33:33.244 --> 33:35.474
No. Absolutely not.

33:38.383 --> 33:41.079
Then why haven't you asked me
to come with you?

33:46.424 --> 33:47.789
Did you kiss him?

33:53.031 --> 33:54.020
Yes.

33:55.199 --> 33:58.760
I'm sorry. You have to believe me.
That's not what this is about.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.027
Nathan--

34:01.406 --> 34:05.274
Haley, listen.
If you want to go, you should go.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.409
But if you do...

34:10.581 --> 34:11.706
we're done.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.289
Unpack.

34:33.471 --> 34:34.460
I can't.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.364
I said unpack.

34:42.179 --> 34:43.168
No.

34:46.016 --> 34:47.005
Lucas.

34:48.553 --> 34:52.420
If you'd tell me what Dan has said or done,
we could fight him together.

34:55.326 --> 34:56.554
No, we can't.

35:44.175 --> 35:46.769
Go back to sleep. I've got her.

36:03.895 --> 36:05.385
Hey, Mouth. You're just in time.

36:05.463 --> 36:07.761
I am so buzzed
from the reaction to my campaign...

36:07.832 --> 36:09.356
that I'm gonna practice my speech.

36:09.433 --> 36:12.561
I'm the one who threw the brick
through your car window.

36:14.272 --> 36:15.864
I was drunk and...

36:17.441 --> 36:18.601
I was angry.

36:21.279 --> 36:22.644
Angry about what?

36:24.282 --> 36:27.843
Being a little brother to you
and everyone else.

36:36.661 --> 36:39.289
I'm not sure
we can be friends anymore, Mouth.

36:42.466 --> 36:43.626
Me, neither.

36:46.637 --> 36:47.899
It's too hard.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.075
I thought I knew you.

37:06.557 --> 37:09.685
But I guess it's easier
to see what we want...

37:11.362 --> 37:13.159
than to look for the truth.

37:16.367 --> 37:19.131
You think you know me, but you don't.

37:21.005 --> 37:23.906
And that means you don't know
what I can do.

37:27.979 --> 37:31.471
<i>You see me as someone who's popular</i>
<i>and has all the answers.</i>

37:32.383 --> 37:33.873
<i>That's not true.</i>

37:51.002 --> 37:54.233
I know what it's like
to search for something more, Haley.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.574
That's why I'm always running.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.742
But then, I've never had a Nathan
to come home to.

38:05.516 --> 38:07.780
<i>I may not always know what I'm doing.</i>

38:09.387 --> 38:11.548
<i>But I'll try to make things better.</i>

38:27.104 --> 38:28.696
It's for you. Come on.

38:32.476 --> 38:34.603
Don't say I never gave you anything.

38:34.679 --> 38:37.477
<i>And when I make a mistake.</i>
<i>Because, face it...</i>

38:38.616 --> 38:39.708
<i>we all do.</i>

38:43.554 --> 38:47.513
He left. And I don't know what to do.

38:52.363 --> 38:54.456
<i>I promise I'll ask for your help.</i>

39:13.718 --> 39:14.707
Haley?

39:17.955 --> 39:20.947
I'm sorry, Nathan. She's gone.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.628
<i>I can't do this alone.</i>

39:41.979 --> 39:45.813
<i>But if you'll take a chance on me,</i>
<i>we can do great things together.</i>

39:51.889 --> 39:56.383
<i>I promise if you believe in me, I'll find</i>
<i>the courage to reach for your every dream.</i>

40:24.855 --> 40:28.416
-You got everything you need?
-Yeah.

40:29.193 --> 40:32.890
Listen, thank you
for paying for my medication.

40:34.165 --> 40:37.794
I don't want my mom to know,
so I need you to keep footing the bill.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.268
Sure. It'll stay our secret.

40:42.339 --> 40:43.931
But tell me something.

40:44.575 --> 40:47.408
How did you convince her
that you didn't have HCM?

40:50.681 --> 40:53.445
I used Keith's negative-results letter.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.442
Really?

40:58.022 --> 41:00.889
I wouldn't have pegged you
as being so duplicitous.

41:03.828 --> 41:06.058
I guess I'm your son after all.

41:12.269 --> 41:14.430
<i>John F. Kennedy said the courage of life...</i>

41:14.505 --> 41:18.168
<i>is a magnificent mixture of</i>
<i>triumph and tragedy.</i>

41:19.844 --> 41:23.575
<i>A man does what he must</i>
<i>in spite of personal consequences...</i>

41:23.981 --> 41:27.849
<i>in spite of obstacles and dangers</i>
<i>and pressures.</i>

41:32.056 --> 41:34.490
<i>And that is the basis of all morality.</i>

43:01.045 --> 43:02.034
