00:05.336 --> 00:07.298
Hey, Mom.
Hey, stink bug.

00:07.298 --> 00:09.340
I'm so excited.

00:09.340 --> 00:11.972
There's a-- Okay, do I stink?
Now you're inside my head.

00:11.972 --> 00:14.475
You're stinking cute,
you little bug.

00:14.475 --> 00:16.347
Okay, let's start this
whole thing again.

00:16.347 --> 00:17.688
Hey, Mom.
Don't reply.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.522
There's a museum exhibit
I'm dying to see
in San Francisco.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.854
It's nearly sold out,
but I managed to get us

00:23.854 --> 00:25.236
two tickets
for next Saturday night

00:25.236 --> 00:26.947
and I was hoping you
and I could go.

00:26.947 --> 00:31.412
Oh, that sounds like
so much fun, stink-- Avery.

00:31.412 --> 00:36.247
Gimme the deets, GF.
That's teen speak, GF.

00:36.247 --> 00:38.249
See? I'm getting ready for
some mother-daughter bonding.

00:38.249 --> 00:41.082
We should totally
do each other's nails.

00:41.082 --> 00:44.425
Yeah, we have plenty of time
for none of that, GF.

00:44.425 --> 00:46.087
So, we'll drive up
Friday night.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.928
Our tickets aren't
until Saturday night,

00:47.928 --> 00:49.430
so we'll get up there
nice and early.

00:49.430 --> 00:51.762
Oh. We can bond
as we drive up the coast.

00:51.762 --> 00:53.844
I heard it's so beautiful.
I've always wanted to see it.

00:53.844 --> 00:56.887
Oh, and maybe
someday you will.

00:56.887 --> 00:59.640
But this trip,
we're taking
the fast route inland,

00:59.640 --> 01:01.272
bonding through
the cow fields.

01:01.272 --> 01:02.773
You can moo at them
and hope that they respond

01:02.773 --> 01:04.275
like you always do
when you see cows.

01:04.275 --> 01:05.736
I do love a good moo-back.

01:07.448 --> 01:10.321
So, Avery and I are going
to San Francisco next weekend.

01:10.321 --> 01:13.114
It was Avery's idea.
Don't make a big
thing about it.

01:13.114 --> 01:15.116
She came to me!

01:15.116 --> 01:17.368
Well, of course.
She can't drive and--

01:17.368 --> 01:20.291
I mean, she came to you.
That's great.

01:21.542 --> 01:23.704
But my dance recital
is next Saturday.

01:23.704 --> 01:25.966
Oh, my gosh,
I totally forgot.

01:25.966 --> 01:27.628
I'm so sorry, Chloe.

01:27.628 --> 01:29.340
I bought the tickets
and I totally forgot
about your recital.

01:29.340 --> 01:30.801
But we don't want
to miss seeing you dance.

01:34.345 --> 01:35.716
There.
You saw me dance.

01:36.767 --> 01:38.349
The real problem is,

01:38.349 --> 01:39.980
who's gonna do my makeup
and hair bun?

01:39.980 --> 01:41.312
You have no idea
how important

01:41.312 --> 01:43.274
it is to get the makeup
and hair exactly right.

01:43.274 --> 01:46.527
Face it, none of us can dance.
It's all about the buns.

01:46.527 --> 01:49.490
Well, sweetie,
I could do your bun.

01:49.490 --> 01:51.612
Really? What's
the difference

01:51.612 --> 01:53.404
between a hair pin
and a bobby pin?

01:53.404 --> 01:55.576
Too late!
My hair fell into my eyes,

01:55.576 --> 01:57.328
I twirled off stage
into the front row,

01:57.328 --> 01:59.330
and landed in a face
full of grandma-lap.

02:01.502 --> 02:04.415
Yeah, Bennett,
you can't just do the bun.

02:04.415 --> 02:07.007
I went to three weeks of
bun-making seminars.

02:07.007 --> 02:09.420
Remember, my hand
got stuck in a bun-cramp?

02:11.802 --> 02:13.424
Avery, what if we postpone
the trip?

02:13.424 --> 02:15.596
We can't.
The exhibit closes that night.

02:15.596 --> 02:18.349
All right, Chloe,
what if I do your hair

02:18.349 --> 02:20.221
first thing Saturday morning,
and then we leave right after?

02:20.221 --> 02:22.683
We'll still have plenty of time
to make it to the museum.

02:22.683 --> 02:25.936
- I guess that could work.
- But I have to keep
my bun perfect all day.

02:25.936 --> 02:27.438
What if something
goes wrong?

02:27.438 --> 02:29.230
Like Olivia Winder
challenging me

02:29.230 --> 02:31.031
to a somersault contest.

02:31.031 --> 02:33.194
I'm supposed
to just plunk out?

02:33.194 --> 02:35.696
Well, girls, that sounds like
a good compromise.

02:35.696 --> 02:38.779
Avery gets her trip,
Chloe, gets her bun

02:38.779 --> 02:42.413
and with the bed all to myself,
I can sleep like a spider.

03:00.301 --> 03:03.143
- Stan, wake up.
- It's 5:00 A.M., Tyler.

03:03.143 --> 03:05.516
If you need to see me,
make an appointment
with my assistant.

03:08.148 --> 03:10.691
He's actually an intern.
He's trying to break
into the business.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.903
- Monkey business?
- Tyler, be serious.

03:14.485 --> 03:17.578
You be serious.
I need your help.
Nikki's gone and--

03:17.578 --> 03:20.491
Nikki's gone?
Don't worry, Tyler,
I can find her.

03:20.491 --> 03:22.993
I have a very particular
set of skills,

03:22.993 --> 03:25.496
skills I have acquired
over a very long career...

03:25.496 --> 03:27.668
as a dog.

03:27.668 --> 03:30.291
Robert,
clear my schedule.

03:30.291 --> 03:32.172
No, she's not missing.

03:32.172 --> 03:34.295
She flew back to El Salvador
last night to visit her aunt.

03:34.295 --> 03:36.096
The one who works
on Lace and Tears?

03:36.096 --> 03:38.339
That's my favorite
telenovela!

03:38.339 --> 03:40.010
Oh, there's something
I've always wondered

03:40.010 --> 03:42.893
about that show that
she has to ask her aunt for me.

03:42.893 --> 03:45.556
What are they talking about?
Because I don't speak Spanish.

03:46.767 --> 03:48.939
We haven't been
dating that long,

03:48.939 --> 03:50.811
and it's our first
time apart, so I don't
know what to text her.

03:50.811 --> 03:52.693
Oh, Robert, you have
a similar situation

03:52.693 --> 03:55.656
with that stuffed elephant
in Canada, right?

03:55.656 --> 03:57.278
Oh, she did?
Never mind then.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.119
Continue.

03:59.119 --> 04:01.121
When I was
chasing after Nikki,

04:01.121 --> 04:03.744
she wasn't interested
because I was trying too hard.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.746
So I have
to play it cool.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.748
But I so want to tell her
that she's my life,

04:07.748 --> 04:10.080
my world,
the air that I breathe.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.962
Wait, I know.

04:11.962 --> 04:14.375
Winky face.
And send.

04:16.086 --> 04:18.088
Come on, Mom, it's 5:00 A.M.
Let's go!

04:18.088 --> 04:19.590
You said we were
leaving in the morning.

04:19.590 --> 04:21.432
You didn't say anything
about 5:00 A.M.

04:21.432 --> 04:23.684
It was right there
in the itinerary
I slipped under your door.

04:23.684 --> 04:25.596
Wait, is that what came
under my door at 2:00 A.M.?

04:25.596 --> 04:27.978
I was so drowsy,
I thought I was at a hotel.

04:27.978 --> 04:31.101
I ordered a cheese plate
and tried to check out
on the DVR.

04:31.101 --> 04:32.773
But the cheese plate came.

04:33.984 --> 04:37.157
Nice work, Robert.

04:37.157 --> 04:39.570
Come on, Mom,
we need to get on
the road to San Francisco.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.071
I have to do
Chloe's hair first.

04:41.071 --> 04:42.953
I know.
She's in the kitchen.

04:42.953 --> 04:44.365
Okay, great. I'll do her bun,
then I have to go upstairs

04:44.365 --> 04:46.246
and pick up the towels
I left on the floor,

04:46.246 --> 04:48.329
and return the bathrobe
I apparently stole from myself.

04:50.961 --> 04:53.173
All right, you have
half an hour to get Chloe's
bun and makeup done

04:53.173 --> 04:55.085
so that we can
stay on schedule.

04:55.085 --> 04:56.337
That's not nearly
enough time.

04:56.337 --> 04:58.298
Well, I budgeted
one minute for you

04:58.298 --> 04:59.680
to complain about not having
nearly enough time,

04:59.680 --> 05:01.592
so if you'd like to stop
complaining now,

05:01.592 --> 05:03.223
you can roll the remaining
45 seconds

05:03.223 --> 05:04.725
into your hair
and makeup time.

05:04.725 --> 05:07.057
Okay, let's go, Chloe.

05:09.099 --> 05:10.310
All right, I am gonna
pack up the car.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.692
You have 27 minutes.

05:11.692 --> 05:13.063
I had 30 minutes
a minute ago.

05:14.935 --> 05:17.237
Mom, I know I'm being
a little rigid about all this,

05:17.237 --> 05:19.279
but it's only because
I can't wait to get
on the road with you

05:19.279 --> 05:23.203
and have
the best time ever.
You have 25 minutes.

05:25.285 --> 05:28.248
- Ow, ow, oww.
- Too tight?

05:28.248 --> 05:30.210
My ballet teacher,
Madame Olga says,

05:30.210 --> 05:32.663
( in Russian accent )
A bun that is too tight

05:32.663 --> 05:34.294
is like a good
bowl of borscht.

05:34.294 --> 05:37.257
There's no such thing.

05:38.258 --> 05:41.301
Ow! Oww! Oww!

05:41.301 --> 05:44.134
Okay, done.
Just be very careful
not to get your hair

05:44.134 --> 05:46.677
or makeup messed up
before tonight.
You feeling okay?

05:46.677 --> 05:48.639
The pain has changed
to a dull throb,

05:48.639 --> 05:50.681
so if Madame Olga
is right,

05:50.681 --> 05:52.933
( Russian accent )
soon the numbness
will blanket me

05:52.933 --> 05:55.396
like a Siberian winter.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.857
So good job, Mommy!

05:59.860 --> 06:01.902
Stan, you have
a huge responsibility today.

06:01.902 --> 06:04.284
While I'm gone,
you're gonna have to be me.

06:04.284 --> 06:05.576
I can do that.

06:05.576 --> 06:07.197
TOGETHER: It's not as easy
as you think.

06:07.197 --> 06:08.619
What are you doing?

06:08.619 --> 06:10.330
Just repeating me doesn't mean
you're being me.

06:10.330 --> 06:11.992
Stop that.
Stop that now.

06:11.992 --> 06:13.043
Stop that now.

06:13.043 --> 06:15.496
Now. Now!

06:15.496 --> 06:18.298
This may sound arrogant,
but I'm the glue

06:18.298 --> 06:20.130
that holds this
family together.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.803
But I thought
I was the glue.

06:22.803 --> 06:25.345
Oh, no, of course.
You are the glue.

06:25.345 --> 06:26.927
I'm more of the fixer.

06:26.927 --> 06:28.429
Then you should
probably go back

06:28.429 --> 06:30.270
and fix that comment about me
not being the glue,

06:30.270 --> 06:32.433
because it was very hurtful.

06:32.433 --> 06:36.276
You know, you're right.
It was thoughtless of me
and I'm very sorry.

06:36.276 --> 06:38.188
Wow, I feel a lot better.

06:38.188 --> 06:40.901
You are the fixer.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.233
So if anything happens
while I'm away,

06:43.233 --> 06:44.905
you're gonna have
to step in and fix it.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.236
That's what I meant
before when I said

06:46.236 --> 06:47.237
you have to be me.

06:47.237 --> 06:48.368
You got it, Avery.

06:48.368 --> 06:49.790
TOGETHER: Thanks, Stan.

06:49.790 --> 06:51.992
That means a lot to--
Stop it, Stan!

06:53.333 --> 06:55.125
I just hope
everything goes smoothly.

06:55.125 --> 06:56.707
This weekend
is so important to me.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.338
Mom thinks we're
going to the museum

06:58.338 --> 07:00.420
to see an exhibit,
but I have something

07:00.420 --> 07:01.922
very special that I want
to surprise her with.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.254
Oh, my gosh,
you're going
to steal a painting!

07:04.254 --> 07:06.386
Why did you tell me?
Now I'm in on it!

07:08.138 --> 07:10.010
After my mild
freak out,

07:10.010 --> 07:11.221
in which I suggested
we set Robert up

07:11.221 --> 07:13.263
as the patsy
to take the fall

07:13.263 --> 07:14.935
for stealing the painting,

07:14.935 --> 07:17.267
Avery decided not to tell me
what the surprise was.

07:17.267 --> 07:18.939
Don't worry, Robert.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.361
I would've made sure
your family was taken care of.

07:23.984 --> 07:26.406
Bye, Mommy, bye, Avery.
Have fun, gals!

07:26.406 --> 07:29.990
Okay, I did not want
to worry Mommy

07:29.990 --> 07:33.874
and spoil their trip,
but I'm feeling a little woozy.

07:33.874 --> 07:37.457
Oh, I didn't realize
it was this bad.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.130
I think I might be coming down
with something.

07:40.130 --> 07:41.421
I need to sit down.

07:43.253 --> 07:45.135
My bun!

07:45.135 --> 07:46.887
Seriously,
I need to sit down.

07:48.218 --> 07:51.261
Oh, no. Avery left me
to be the fixer.

07:51.261 --> 07:53.263
So many problems:
Chloe's bun,

07:53.263 --> 07:55.395
Bennett's sick,
Tyler's missing.

07:56.897 --> 07:59.149
Well, solved
the Tyler problem.

07:59.149 --> 08:00.861
I think
I've earned a massage.

08:00.861 --> 08:02.402
Robert,
crack those knuckles

08:02.402 --> 08:04.274
and meet me on the patio.

08:06.196 --> 08:09.700
No, this is
what you signed up for.

08:13.914 --> 08:15.455
Dad, you need
to get better.

08:15.455 --> 08:18.709
Oh. I'm okay.
It's just a little cold.

08:18.709 --> 08:20.671
No, I mean get better
at fixing hair.

08:20.671 --> 08:22.713
Look at me!

08:22.713 --> 08:25.586
I'm gonna look at you
with my eyes closed.

08:25.586 --> 08:27.467
That'll be nice.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.590
Oh, yeah, it is.

08:31.221 --> 08:33.894
Man, Nikki never replied
to my winky-face text.

08:33.894 --> 08:36.186
I can't text her
twice in a row.

08:36.186 --> 08:39.099
That wouldn't be cool.
What do I do?

08:39.099 --> 08:41.351
Nikki would know,
she knows everything.

08:41.351 --> 08:43.564
I should text her.
No!

08:46.316 --> 08:49.449
We got to call Mommy
and tell her to come
back and fix my hair.

08:50.911 --> 08:52.282
( Stan exclaims )

08:53.784 --> 08:55.576
And your makeup.
Whoa!

08:55.576 --> 08:57.207
What's wrong
with my makeup?

08:57.207 --> 08:59.660
Nothing, if you're in
a heavy metal band.

08:59.660 --> 09:01.461
But don't worry about that.

09:01.461 --> 09:03.964
We're not ruining your mom's
and Avery's trip.

09:03.964 --> 09:05.425
So what's the plan?

09:05.425 --> 09:07.047
I see only one option:

09:07.047 --> 09:08.759
you join a heavy metal band.

09:08.759 --> 09:11.261
Can you play three chords
on a guitar and go like this?

09:11.261 --> 09:13.433
( screaming )

09:13.433 --> 09:14.434
What was that?

09:18.018 --> 09:20.270
And there's
mile marker 254. Check.

09:20.270 --> 09:23.353
Are you going to check off
every mile marker we pass?

09:23.353 --> 09:26.066
Well, I need to do something
between checking off
every time you say,

09:26.066 --> 09:28.318
"Isn't this fun" while doing
a little shoulder dance.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.361
Well, isn't this fun?

09:32.863 --> 09:35.365
And there's another
cow herd. Moo!

09:35.365 --> 09:38.038
( cows mooing )

09:38.038 --> 09:39.790
Yes!
Check that off!

09:39.790 --> 09:42.252
Already did.
You're up to seven moo-backs.

09:42.252 --> 09:45.465
Eight, if you include
that hitchhiker who mooed
for some reason.

09:46.667 --> 09:49.049
I have to say, Mom,
I'm pretty stoked.

09:49.049 --> 09:51.421
Traffic is light
and we're ahead of schedule.

09:51.421 --> 09:54.264
We might even have time
before the exhibit
to visit Alcatraz.

09:54.264 --> 09:56.306
I hope it's not too late
to get tickets.

09:56.306 --> 09:57.477
How do you
even get into Alcatraz?

09:57.477 --> 09:59.559
Commit a crime before 1963.

10:03.183 --> 10:05.185
We are having
so much fun.

10:08.729 --> 10:10.400
Daddy, you're
looking much better.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.362
I'm feeling much better.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.154
Then can
you fix my hair?

10:14.154 --> 10:16.156
Of course, Tyler.

10:17.407 --> 10:19.079
Oh, no.

10:19.079 --> 10:21.331
Chloe's dance recital
is just a few hours away.

10:21.331 --> 10:24.044
If I'm gonna be Avery,
I've got to fix this.

10:24.044 --> 10:27.047
But if I'm gonna fix this,
I've got to be Avery.

10:29.549 --> 10:33.423
Avery?
How was the museum?

10:33.423 --> 10:36.216
Or Stan, good boy.

10:36.216 --> 10:38.428
I don't know
what is going on.

10:42.062 --> 10:44.354
Bennett can use the hair
spray on Chloe's hair.

10:47.317 --> 10:49.980
If this doesn't work,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

10:49.980 --> 10:51.361
Ooh, Tyler's phone.

10:51.361 --> 10:53.233
I bet Nikki would know
what to do.

10:53.233 --> 10:54.534
She knows everything.

10:54.534 --> 10:58.158
"I need you, Nikki."

10:58.158 --> 11:00.240
Chloe, what are you doing
with my phone?

11:00.240 --> 11:01.541
And Stan, why are
you dressed like--

11:01.541 --> 11:03.163
Okay, I don't even care.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.705
Chloe, what are you
doing with my phone?

11:05.706 --> 11:08.128
"I need you, Nikki."

11:08.128 --> 11:10.050
What? She's going to think
this is from me!

11:10.050 --> 11:12.843
"I'm so sad
about my hair.

11:12.843 --> 11:14.885
How am I gonna dance
with the other girls tonight?"

11:14.885 --> 11:16.506
Chloe!

11:16.506 --> 11:21.261
Tyler, do not yell at
the red plant I'm watering.

11:21.261 --> 11:24.765
You're a thirsty little shrub,
aren't you?

11:24.765 --> 11:26.266
Aw, man.

11:26.266 --> 11:28.358
Why was I plumping
while you were spraying?

11:30.230 --> 11:32.402
It's just getting
worse and worse.

11:32.402 --> 11:34.114
Of all the times for Robert

11:34.114 --> 11:36.236
to take a personal day
and stick me with Chris.

11:36.236 --> 11:40.320
And you wonder
why you're still a temp, Chris.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.873
Don't give up
on yourself, Chris.

11:45.325 --> 11:48.128
We're making great time,
and I only missed
one mile marker

11:48.128 --> 11:50.420
when I had to calm you down
after that double moo-back.

11:51.631 --> 11:53.333
I'm still freaking out.

11:53.333 --> 11:58.008
A double moo-back, Avery!
What does it mean?

11:58.008 --> 11:59.930
Ooh, there's another sign
for the Greenville Garlic
Extravaganza.

11:59.930 --> 12:02.262
We have time.

12:02.262 --> 12:06.346
Mom, let's just ride
this double moo-back wave
and go out on a high note.

12:06.346 --> 12:09.349
Come on, Avery.
We're making such great time
that we have a cushion.

12:09.349 --> 12:12.352
I want to allow that extra time
to make sure that we get there.

12:12.352 --> 12:13.483
Oh, Avery, come on.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.315
Mom, I don't
want us to miss

12:15.315 --> 12:17.697
the surprise... ingly good
time that we're gonna have.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.202
We need that cushion in case
things go horribly wrong.

12:22.202 --> 12:24.204
What could
go horribly wrong?

12:27.707 --> 12:29.499
So remember
when we weren't stuck

12:29.499 --> 12:31.331
on the side of
a mountain road
in a snowstorm,

12:31.331 --> 12:33.713
and you suggested we drive up
to the garlic festival

12:33.713 --> 12:36.046
and then asked,
"What could go horribly wrong?"

12:38.428 --> 12:39.509
Vaguely.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.267
Now we're stuck
in the snow,

12:47.267 --> 12:49.229
and we'll never make it
to the museum.

12:49.229 --> 12:51.731
And just so you could get
all these stupid
garlic souvenirs.

12:51.731 --> 12:55.195
Stupid? This T-shirt's
scratch and sniff.

12:55.195 --> 12:57.157
It smells like garlic
if you do this.

12:57.157 --> 12:59.950
That's not the t-shirt,
that's you.

12:59.950 --> 13:02.492
I understand you're upset,
and in retrospect,

13:02.492 --> 13:05.785
perhaps the garlic detour
was a bit ill-conceived,

13:05.785 --> 13:08.288
but I've got something
that'll cheer you up.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.500
It's your favorite CD
from when you were little.

13:10.500 --> 13:11.501
Remember
when you were little?

13:11.501 --> 13:12.672
And there were CDs?

13:14.084 --> 13:16.126
Don't forget
the moves we made up.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.419
♪ When you're driving
down the street ♪

13:19.419 --> 13:21.421
♪ All the friendly
cars you meet ♪

13:21.421 --> 13:23.683
♪ Like to stop
and say hello ♪

13:23.683 --> 13:25.886
Now you better join me
for the honks.

13:25.886 --> 13:28.598
♪ Honk, honk!
Honk, honk! ♪

13:28.598 --> 13:30.390
Spell me the word,
stink bug.

13:30.390 --> 13:32.522
Or Stinky B.

13:32.522 --> 13:36.236
That's what I like to call you
when you rock the mic.

13:36.236 --> 13:38.278
Come on, Avery,
this is the part
we used to do together.

13:38.278 --> 13:40.400
♪ Honk, honk!
Honk, honk! ♪

13:40.400 --> 13:42.652
♪ Honk, honk!
Honk, honk! ♪

13:42.652 --> 13:45.205
♪ Honk, honk!
Honk, honk! ♪

13:47.287 --> 13:50.410
The only friendly car
that I want to meet
is a tow truck.

13:50.410 --> 13:51.791
Honk, honk!

13:51.791 --> 13:54.294
I'm sorry we missed
the museum.

13:54.294 --> 13:56.796
But we can still make
memories together.

13:56.796 --> 14:00.800
Maybe now would be a good time
to do each other's nails.

14:02.012 --> 14:03.723
I'll go put on
the snow chains.

14:06.096 --> 14:07.387
( phone rings )

14:08.268 --> 14:10.390
Hello?

14:10.390 --> 14:12.022
Hey, Nikki.

14:12.022 --> 14:13.934
Oh, if you left your phone
at my house,

14:13.934 --> 14:16.566
why don't you just call Tyler
and ask him to look for it?

14:16.566 --> 14:18.568
Yeah, I don't know
anyone's number either.

14:18.568 --> 14:20.320
But I bet that business card
I gave you doesn't seem

14:20.320 --> 14:22.192
so silly now, does it?

14:22.192 --> 14:24.324
Do you need another one?
I have 999 left.

14:25.445 --> 14:28.408
Yeah, I agree,
one is enough.

14:28.408 --> 14:30.870
Yeah, let me look up
Tyler's phone number for you.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.123
Hello?
Hello?

14:33.123 --> 14:35.165
No signal.

14:35.165 --> 14:36.256
Whoa!

14:37.457 --> 14:39.759
Hey, look at this.

14:39.759 --> 14:44.965
Look, a snow baby walked up
the side of the car.

14:44.965 --> 14:47.597
Silly snow baby.

14:49.349 --> 14:50.720
BENNETT: Whose phone is this?

14:50.720 --> 14:54.274
Oh, Tyler's texting me.
That's nice.

14:54.274 --> 14:58.358
Oh, look. He's going dancing
with other girls.

14:58.358 --> 15:00.690
That's my boy.

15:02.442 --> 15:04.654
I texted Nikki that Chloe's
the one who sent

15:04.654 --> 15:07.197
those other texts before,
but she hasn't replied.

15:07.197 --> 15:09.079
She must not believe me.

15:09.079 --> 15:10.370
What if she never
talks to me again?

15:10.370 --> 15:12.412
We have bigger problems.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.954
Big, red,
curly problems.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.586
And as the acting Avery,
I command you--

15:16.586 --> 15:19.249
- isn't that
what she does?
- Yeah.

15:19.249 --> 15:22.342
I command you to rinse
all that hairspray

15:22.342 --> 15:24.094
out of Chloe's hair
and fix it.

15:24.094 --> 15:25.845
How do you know
I won't mess up her hair

15:25.845 --> 15:27.347
because I'm mad at her
for sending those texts?

15:27.347 --> 15:29.429
Because,
you're a good brother.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.640
And because you can't
willfully mess up hair.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.352
It means
too much to you.

15:32.352 --> 15:35.355
True. But what do I know about
doing a girl's hair?

15:35.355 --> 15:37.357
It's just like
doing your hair,

15:37.357 --> 15:40.230
- only it doesn't take
nearly as long.
- True.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.442
All right, Chloe, come here.
We're going to do your hair.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.024
I already did my makeup.

15:47.237 --> 15:48.328
Wash that off, too.

15:48.328 --> 15:50.200
I don't want to.
I love clowns.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.954
Tyler? Tyler?

15:54.954 --> 15:58.458
I hate being sick.
My throat hurts so much.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.459
( phone chimes )

16:00.750 --> 16:02.542
Oh, it's from Nikki!

16:02.542 --> 16:04.884
She says her throat
hurts so much,
she couldn't call me.

16:06.046 --> 16:07.637
You can deal
with that later.

16:07.637 --> 16:10.640
I have to get ready
for my recital.
It's in an hour!

16:10.640 --> 16:13.183
I'm gonna ask her
about her feelings.
Girls love that.

16:13.183 --> 16:15.435
He's asking about
my feelings.

16:15.435 --> 16:18.358
I love that.

16:18.358 --> 16:20.440
She says she feels hot,
then cold.

16:20.440 --> 16:23.273
Women.
Am I right?

16:23.273 --> 16:26.406
Now she says
she's sweating like a pig.

16:26.406 --> 16:28.028
Have we reached
the part in our relationship

16:28.028 --> 16:31.281
where nothing's
embarrassing?
Aw, yeah.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.663
"You're the cutest pig
I've ever seen."

16:36.166 --> 16:38.668
You're a sweet boy, Tyler.

16:38.668 --> 16:39.669
Thanks, Dad.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.252
Hello?

16:45.885 --> 16:49.679
All right, Stan,
I got all the makeup off.

16:49.679 --> 16:51.681
But I've got
less than an hour

16:51.681 --> 16:53.763
before we have
to be at my recital.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.395
If I show up
looking like this,

16:55.395 --> 16:58.188
Madame Olga's gonna say,
"Its okay, Chloe,"

16:58.188 --> 17:00.640
but not mean it!

17:00.640 --> 17:02.442
I'm sorry, Chloe.

17:02.442 --> 17:04.904
I tried to be Avery
but I'm just not.

17:04.904 --> 17:06.906
Of course you're not.
You're a dog.

17:06.906 --> 17:10.200
Avery's the future CEO
of a Fortune 500 company.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.493
At least that's what it says
on her business card.

17:13.493 --> 17:16.116
Wait a minute,
you're right.

17:16.116 --> 17:18.248
I'm a dog.

17:18.248 --> 17:20.710
I need to solve your problem
the way a dog would.

17:20.710 --> 17:23.123
Dogs groom each other,
and that's what I'm
gonna do to you.

17:23.123 --> 17:25.835
Sit right here and get ready
to feel special.

17:38.388 --> 17:41.231
Thanks, Stan.
That's amazing,
but will it hold?

17:41.231 --> 17:43.183
Oh, yeah.

17:43.183 --> 17:45.565
I used a special product
to make sure it does.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.237
Dog slobber.

17:48.898 --> 17:50.360
Now if you'll excuse me.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.362
( coughing )

17:55.995 --> 17:57.197
Oh, there's your barrette.

17:59.249 --> 18:00.700
What about my makeup?

18:00.700 --> 18:03.253
I have a plan
for that, too.

18:03.253 --> 18:05.004
Bam! Bam!
Bam!

18:05.004 --> 18:07.046
Bam! Bam! Bam!

18:09.799 --> 18:12.712
Wow. Stan, it's amazing
you can do that.

18:12.712 --> 18:14.013
Not really.

18:14.013 --> 18:15.805
This is something
all dogs can do.

18:15.805 --> 18:18.057
Why do you think supermodels
have dogs in their purses?

18:19.599 --> 18:23.102
I look great, but who's gonna
get me flowers?

18:23.102 --> 18:25.225
I can't be the only girl
without flowers.

18:25.225 --> 18:27.527
Women.
Am I right?

18:28.648 --> 18:30.069
I'll get you
some flowers.

18:36.326 --> 18:38.998
I'm telling you,
if a woman invented snow chains,

18:38.998 --> 18:41.291
they'd go right on.
Men. Am I right?

18:43.042 --> 18:45.505
I guess we're going
to have to stay here
and wait until it clears up.

18:45.505 --> 18:48.208
Sweetie, I'm sorry
we're missing the museum.

18:48.208 --> 18:50.340
I know you really wanted
to see that exhibit.

18:50.340 --> 18:52.342
I just can't believe
we came all this way

18:52.342 --> 18:54.804
- and you won't even
get to see the Munier.
- The what?

18:54.804 --> 18:56.216
The print that you have
hanging in your room.

18:56.216 --> 18:58.348
Munier's Mother Dearest.

18:58.348 --> 19:00.430
I remember how you told me
that was the painting

19:00.430 --> 19:02.262
that you would look at
when you used to rock me
to sleep every night.

19:02.262 --> 19:04.314
Then when I got
a little older,

19:04.314 --> 19:07.187
- we would
look at it together.
- I love that painting.

19:07.187 --> 19:11.150
You pointed to it when you
said your first word: "Mama."

19:11.150 --> 19:12.532
I was a little hurt
you weren't pointing at me,

19:12.532 --> 19:14.234
but that's fine, that's fine.

19:14.234 --> 19:16.075
Whenever I look
at the mother and daughter

19:16.075 --> 19:17.657
in that painting,
I always think of us.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.660
I know. And I wanted us
to go see the original together.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.662
It's temporarily
on display at the museum.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.914
That's why I wanted
to go so badly.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.746
This trip was all for me?

19:26.746 --> 19:30.290
Yeah.
I wanted to surprise you.

19:30.290 --> 19:33.002
Now I'm really sad
we're missing it,

19:33.002 --> 19:35.465
and not because the tickets cost
so much "Munier."

19:35.465 --> 19:38.348
Good one, Ellen.

19:38.348 --> 19:41.391
Gosh, I can't believe
you were doing this
amazing, thoughtful thing.

19:41.391 --> 19:43.893
I ruined the whole trip
by getting angry.

19:43.893 --> 19:46.105
I just wanted
this weekend to be perfect.

19:46.105 --> 19:48.938
Oh, sweetie,
this is perfect.

19:48.938 --> 19:51.771
This is exactly what I wanted,
this moment.

19:51.771 --> 19:54.524
Us. Bonding.
I'll never forget it.

19:54.524 --> 19:56.986
Thanks, Mom.

19:56.986 --> 19:58.578
I'll never forget it, either.

19:59.739 --> 20:00.990
Love you.

20:00.990 --> 20:03.913
Hey,
I know what we need.

20:06.496 --> 20:10.670
♪ If a car is feeling sad,
he will cry honk, honk ♪

20:10.670 --> 20:14.884
♪ If a car gets confused,
he will say why, honk, honk ♪

20:14.884 --> 20:16.926
♪ Honk, honk!
Honk, honk! ♪

20:16.926 --> 20:19.008

20:19.008 --> 20:21.010
♪ Honk, honk!

Honk, honk! ♪

20:29.689 --> 20:31.110

20:33.112 --> 20:35.905
- Hey, how was the museum?
- No, we didn't make it.

20:35.905 --> 20:37.777
What?
That's terrible.

20:37.777 --> 20:39.659
We were trapped in the car,
stuck in the snow,

20:39.659 --> 20:41.661
in the middle of
nowhere for hours.

20:41.661 --> 20:43.573
She had to talk to me.
It was great!

20:43.573 --> 20:45.665
Mom, I wanted
to talk to you.

20:45.665 --> 20:48.748
Which anecdote
about my wacky life
did you enjoy the most?

20:48.748 --> 20:51.080
Probably the time that you
and your roommates
took that wild trip to--

20:51.080 --> 20:52.292
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That was great.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.174
Mommy!
You're home!

20:55.174 --> 20:58.298
Oh, sweetie,
how was the recital?
I can't wait to see the video.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.930
I had the best bun,
and I got the biggest flowers

21:00.930 --> 21:02.762
from Daddy
with a note saying,

21:02.762 --> 21:05.385
"I'll love you forever,
Tiffany."

21:05.385 --> 21:06.766
I don't know.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.230
I did a great job.

21:11.230 --> 21:13.353
I must've been
in the zone.

21:13.353 --> 21:15.234
I don't remember
any of it.

21:17.857 --> 21:19.198
Sweetie,
you don't look so good.

21:19.198 --> 21:22.241
I'm not, hon.
I've got a 102-degree fever.

21:22.241 --> 21:25.164
I spent the weekend
shaking and shivering.

21:25.164 --> 21:28.037
This is the only thing
that gives me any comfort.

21:28.037 --> 21:30.370
I call her Joanie.

21:31.541 --> 21:33.172
Come on,
let's get you some tea.

21:33.172 --> 21:35.214
Just having you
home is making me

21:35.214 --> 21:37.176
feel better already.

21:37.176 --> 21:39.008
Why am I holding
a hairball?

21:40.880 --> 21:44.384
Hey, Tyler.
Nikki left her phone here.
She said she misses you.

21:44.384 --> 21:46.766
She does?
Awesome!

21:46.766 --> 21:48.848
Wait, if the phone
was here on the couch,

21:48.848 --> 21:51.270
does that mean I was
texting with Dad?

21:51.270 --> 21:54.604
You said you loved
his cute little nose.

21:54.604 --> 21:57.987
I told Nikki to put a password
on her phone.

21:57.987 --> 21:59.819
Women,
am I right?

22:01.571 --> 22:03.653
STAN: I got to say,
being Avery is hard work.

22:03.653 --> 22:07.367
But it went a lot smoother
when I started doing it as me.

22:07.367 --> 22:09.078
I'm even selling my own
dog slobber hair product.

22:09.078 --> 22:11.911
I call it
Dog Slobber Hair Product.

22:14.253 --> 22:15.505
It hasn't been selling.

22:15.505 --> 22:17.296
Do you think
it's the name?
