WEBVTT

00:03.177 --> 00:05.396
Next up,
The People vs. Pam Allen.

00:05.396 --> 00:07.703
Your Honor, the defense moves
to have this case dismissed

00:07.703 --> 00:11.054
due to my client's
debilitating medical condition.

00:11.054 --> 00:13.274
If I may ask,
what condition is that?

00:13.274 --> 00:15.798
Defendant claims
she's a werewolf.

00:17.278 --> 00:19.628
Actually, Your Honor,
she would be a wiffwolf,

00:19.628 --> 00:22.065
since "were"
is Old English for "man."

00:23.632 --> 00:27.114
Patriarchy strikes again.

00:27.114 --> 00:29.899
Okay, none of this excuses
the fact that Ms. Allen

00:29.899 --> 00:31.335
bit the ankle
of an innocent deliveryman,

00:31.335 --> 00:36.253
then chased his truck
and humped a child's Teddy bear.

00:36.253 --> 00:40.301
Your Honor, try to put
yourself in my client's... paws.

00:40.301 --> 00:41.824
She was very much on edge.

00:41.824 --> 00:43.217
There were fireworks,
and someone nearby

00:43.217 --> 00:45.784
was running a vacuum cleaner.

00:45.784 --> 00:48.222
My neighbors are monsters.

00:49.701 --> 00:52.139
If the defendant is,
indeed, a wiffwolf,

00:52.139 --> 00:55.272
her actions are beyond
the court's jurisdiction.

00:55.272 --> 01:00.060
Therefore, we will allow her
the opportunity to... turn?

01:01.191 --> 01:02.932
Transform?

01:04.064 --> 01:07.458
- We will accept transform.
- Great.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.156
Can we get an infield huddle?

01:10.287 --> 01:12.115
What the hell
is going on here?

01:12.115 --> 01:13.595
We're only three cases in,

01:13.595 --> 01:15.640
and we've already had
a feminist werewolf,

01:15.640 --> 01:17.947
someone trying to break
the time barrier,

01:17.947 --> 01:20.776
and what appears to be
a classic body swap.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.654
It's a Blood Moon, Your Honor.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.395
It's when the city's
craziest cases come in.

01:31.395 --> 01:34.616
We used to actually bet on all
the insanity back in the day.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.052
One year I won the trifecta.

01:36.052 --> 01:38.402
I had invisible man,
a doll come to life,

01:38.402 --> 01:41.013
and an alien trying to get back
to his home planet.

01:42.406 --> 01:44.016
We play Blood Moon Bingo.

01:44.016 --> 01:45.453
The cards would be here already, but...

01:45.453 --> 01:48.847
...the copier is broken!

01:50.371 --> 01:52.938
What?
Trying to set the mood.

01:52.938 --> 01:54.375
Let's call the next case.

01:54.375 --> 01:57.029
Uh, I can't seem to find
the paperwork, Your Honor.

01:57.029 --> 01:58.292
This is a scary one,
Your Honor,

01:58.292 --> 01:59.815
even for a Blood Moon.

01:59.815 --> 02:02.992
Alright, what is it, a zombie,
a swamp monster?

02:02.992 --> 02:05.429
Worse!
It's a mom!

02:05.429 --> 02:07.866
Ahhh!

02:09.041 --> 02:11.392
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh, my gosh!

02:11.392 --> 02:13.698
Oh, good,
now there's two of them.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.543
I know I wasn't supposed
to come down

02:32.543 --> 02:35.198
for another couple of months,
but I just couldn't wait.

02:35.198 --> 02:37.505
What if I got hit by a bus
before then?

02:37.505 --> 02:39.071
It's very possible.

02:39.071 --> 02:41.161
Our town is up to two buses.

02:42.205 --> 02:43.772
Guys, this is my mom, Gina.

02:45.382 --> 02:48.168
Oh, you must be Olivia.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.213
You look just like the lady

02:50.213 --> 02:52.215
they put in the picture frames
at Marshall's.

02:52.215 --> 02:56.872
And then you buy it and think,
"Maybe I'll just keep it in."

02:56.872 --> 02:59.570
- Do you really mean that?
- Yeah.

02:59.570 --> 03:02.356
Not-- Not used
to sincere parenting.

03:02.356 --> 03:03.444
Oh, God, I'm crying.

03:04.793 --> 03:07.230
- And you must be--
- I am, and let me just say

03:07.230 --> 03:09.537
you have excellent taste
in daughters.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.582
- I'm sorry?
- Don't be.

03:11.582 --> 03:15.282
So--
- There's my partner in crime.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.676
Oh, thank you so much
for helping me plan this, Gurgs.

03:18.676 --> 03:19.938
Oh!

03:19.938 --> 03:22.506
That hug has some torque
behind it.

03:22.506 --> 03:25.248
I went to an authentic
New York shop in Times Square

03:25.248 --> 03:28.033
and got you
all personalized key chains.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.905
They had a "Gurgs."

03:29.905 --> 03:31.820
But sorry, they didn't
have a "Neil."

03:31.820 --> 03:34.301
So, I just got you
one that says "Guy."

03:36.128 --> 03:38.261
This says Olivia.
That's my name.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.306
This is a gift.

03:39.306 --> 03:42.091
It's a gift for Olivia.

03:42.091 --> 03:45.355
And for you, my dear,
I brought you a potted plant

03:45.355 --> 03:49.403
because the air-quality index
in Manhattan is just a skull.

03:49.403 --> 03:52.014
She doesn't trust a city
that never sleeps.

03:52.014 --> 03:54.582
And why does it never sleep?

03:54.582 --> 03:56.279
Drugs.

03:58.368 --> 04:01.589
Ah, and here's the famous
Dan Fielding.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.678
Well, hi.
Nice to finally meet you.

04:03.678 --> 04:06.071
- Gina.
- Ah, Gina.

04:06.071 --> 04:07.421
You look familiar.

04:07.421 --> 04:09.249
Have we ever--
- We've never met.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.338
I've heard a lot
about you from Harry.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.600
Ah.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.472
Um, I need to use
the ladies room.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.474
Oh, down the hall
and to the left.

04:17.474 --> 04:19.128
And I know you like to have
a good time,

04:19.128 --> 04:21.348
but do not call any of the phone
numbers written in there.

04:21.348 --> 04:22.784
I'm headed that way.

04:22.784 --> 04:25.613
May I show you?
- Oh, what a gentleman.

04:25.613 --> 04:26.875
I love a bathroom escort.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.093
Oh, that's what
those numbers are!

04:28.093 --> 04:30.313
Really, don't call them!

04:30.313 --> 04:31.880
Oh, you're from
Baton Rouge, huh?

04:31.880 --> 04:34.143
I hear there's a lot of jazz
down there.

04:34.143 --> 04:37.189
Listen up, Fielding.
We need to talk.

04:37.189 --> 04:39.627
Oh, my God.
That's who you are!

04:39.627 --> 04:41.498
I thought I recognized you.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.979
You married Harry?
- Zip it!

04:43.979 --> 04:45.459
My daughter doesn't know
we know each other,

04:45.459 --> 04:47.330
and I want to keep it that way.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.505
Wait, so she doesn't know how
you and Harry actually--

04:48.505 --> 04:50.986
Shh!

04:50.986 --> 04:53.467
I'm not getting into this
with you.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.338
I just came here to check
on my daughter

04:55.338 --> 04:57.514
and make sure
you keep your trap shut.

04:57.514 --> 04:59.473
Hey, listen, I know better
than to get mixed up

04:59.473 --> 05:02.084
in whatever this is.

05:02.084 --> 05:05.392
The only family drama
I care about is "Succession."

05:05.392 --> 05:07.132
I'm rooting for the old man.

05:07.132 --> 05:08.525
I want everybody else to die

05:08.525 --> 05:12.181
and him just keep
getting richer and richer.

05:12.181 --> 05:15.402
- So we have an understanding?
- Yes, I understand that

05:15.402 --> 05:19.144
for some reason you want to keep
secrets from your daughter.

05:19.144 --> 05:21.712
Which is none of my business.

05:21.712 --> 05:25.325
Now, are you going to show me
where the bathroom is or not?

05:25.325 --> 05:26.543
Follow me.

05:26.543 --> 05:27.892
What the hell am I doing?

05:27.892 --> 05:29.416
Go that way.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.377
I'm telling you.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.292
There's something
going on between Dan and Gina.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.512
I have a seventh sense
about these things.

05:38.512 --> 05:39.730
Isn't it a sixth sense?

05:39.730 --> 05:41.819
No, my sixth sense
is I see dead people,

05:41.819 --> 05:43.212
like that boy.

05:43.212 --> 05:44.735
- From the movie?
- No, the one next to you.

05:48.435 --> 05:51.263
There she is!
No, you can move.

05:51.263 --> 05:52.743
It's a video.
- Oh, okay.

05:52.743 --> 05:54.223
Well, welcome to Night Court.

05:54.223 --> 05:56.225
Never mind. I stopped it.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.576
Must be nice having
your mom here.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.012
Oh, it's great.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.406
But also it's very bad.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.408
When she pops in like this,
it means she's worried.

06:05.408 --> 06:08.585
I love my mom, but we are
very different people,

06:08.585 --> 06:10.805
and she was always
against me taking this job.

06:10.805 --> 06:13.895
With her, everything has to be
neat and tidy and perfect,

06:13.895 --> 06:15.113
and this place is--

06:15.113 --> 06:17.638
Merry Blood Moon, everyone!

06:17.638 --> 06:19.074
The bingo cards are here.

06:20.771 --> 06:22.904
Like that.

06:22.904 --> 06:25.472
Well, actually,
for legal reasons, it's "binga."

06:25.472 --> 06:27.778
"Blood Moon Bingo"
is a John Cusack Redbox movie.

06:27.778 --> 06:31.565
Ooh, right off the bat,
I got drunk Statue of Liberty.

06:33.784 --> 06:37.527
Here you go, Blaine.
I know you're used to winning--

06:37.527 --> 06:40.443
Oscar pools, trivia nights,
blood drives.

06:40.443 --> 06:43.664
But that ends tonight
because I have been practicing.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.796
This is a game of chance.
How are you practicing?

06:45.796 --> 06:50.105
If you're asking that question,
I'm already in your head.

06:50.105 --> 06:54.022
Honey, remember to engage your
core when banging the gavel.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.200
She hurt her elbow
playing softball.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.941
Now she has a corpse ligament.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.509
You don't really have
to worry, you know.

07:02.509 --> 07:05.512
Corpse ligament or not,
she's very capable.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.514
Is that why you're hiding things
from her?

07:07.514 --> 07:09.472
You don't think
she can handle it?

07:09.472 --> 07:16.174
Excuse me. I'm trying to talk
to my friend, this Beetlejuice.

07:17.698 --> 07:19.656
I call the court to order.
What's the next case?

07:19.656 --> 07:22.485
We have The People vs.
Marsha Roberts, Your Honor.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.487
The defendant was arrested
for barricading patrons

07:24.487 --> 07:27.621
into a Home Depot and blasting
Jimmy Buffett's "Margaritaville"

07:27.621 --> 07:29.840
through the PA system
for six hours.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.843
Your Honor, my client was
merely following instructions

07:32.843 --> 07:36.194
personally given to her
by... Satan.

07:36.194 --> 07:38.109
When you say Satan,
you mean--

07:38.109 --> 07:40.285
The main one.

07:40.285 --> 07:42.374
Satan is my father.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.552
Isn't that wonderful?

07:45.552 --> 07:49.686
Parent and child sharing
an open line of communication.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.296
There are no secrets
in this family.

07:51.296 --> 07:54.474
We should all be so lucky.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.084
Real quick.

07:56.084 --> 08:00.175
When Satan speaks to you, is it
in your head or from a dog?

08:00.175 --> 08:03.004
He speaks
through my air fryer.

08:03.961 --> 08:06.660
Possessed appliances--
I got it.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.578
Order!

08:11.578 --> 08:13.362
As a judge who has everything
under control,

08:13.362 --> 08:15.016
I find Ms. Roberts guilty
of false imprisonment

08:15.016 --> 08:16.800
and call a recess.

08:16.800 --> 08:20.543
Oh, oh, are you calling recess
because a dog told you to?

08:20.543 --> 08:22.763
No!

08:22.763 --> 08:25.940
Satan is a big fan
of your work.

08:25.940 --> 08:28.290
We go way back.

08:30.814 --> 08:34.383
Well, you all certainly
do interesting work around here.

08:34.383 --> 08:36.864
Tonight is a little crazier
than usual,

08:36.864 --> 08:38.082
but I got it handled.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.693
You'll see.
Things will settle down.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.564
Has anyone seen my gun?

08:43.087 --> 08:44.698
Don't worry.
He always finds it.

08:44.698 --> 08:48.266
So, how did you meet Abby's dad?

08:48.266 --> 08:50.660
Oh, no one wants to hear
that boring story.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.707
Personally, I would just love
to hear what you've been

08:53.707 --> 08:55.447
telling Abby all these years.

08:56.405 --> 08:57.798
It's a fairy tale.

08:57.798 --> 09:00.278
My dad was upstate
for the Mel Tormé concert

09:00.278 --> 09:01.758
and decided to go
to the Harvest Festival.

09:01.758 --> 09:04.761
He and my mom ended up
in the same Ferris-wheel cart,

09:04.761 --> 09:07.242
and by the end of the ride,
they fell in love.

09:07.242 --> 09:08.939
Later that night, he proposed, saying,

09:08.939 --> 09:11.638
"You're only one 'yes' away
from the rest of your life."

09:11.638 --> 09:13.901
Almost sounds too good
to be true.

09:13.901 --> 09:15.555
Well, that's exactly
how it happened.

09:17.339 --> 09:18.819
And we had a wonderful life

09:18.819 --> 09:20.777
until my daughter
decided the Big Apple

09:20.777 --> 09:22.823
was more important
than her little mom.

09:22.823 --> 09:25.129
Mom, I'm not going
over this again.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.391
I'm just saying.

09:26.391 --> 09:29.264
I miss you.
Rand misses you.

09:29.264 --> 09:31.875
All the people that love you
are upstate.

09:31.875 --> 09:34.008
You and your mom talk
about how you love each other?

09:34.008 --> 09:36.401
It's not just a word that was
once written in a birthday card

09:36.401 --> 09:37.838
you keep with you at all times?

09:37.838 --> 09:42.320
Did someone hear a phone ring?
I got to take this.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.974
You just seem overwhelmed.

09:43.974 --> 09:47.761
You've only seen one case!
I'm doing good work here, Mom.

09:47.761 --> 09:51.025
Honey, I'm not trying to fight.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.331
You know what?
It's getting late.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.203
I should just head back
to the hotel.

09:55.203 --> 09:56.508
Oh, no, no, don't leave.

09:56.508 --> 09:58.815
You should not leave.
You should stay.

09:58.815 --> 10:02.558
You never know what
the Blood Moon might reveal.

10:04.908 --> 10:06.475
I figured it out, Timo.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.346
Those two have history.

10:08.346 --> 10:13.177
Classic PTSD--
Post Tremendous Sex Disorder.

10:13.177 --> 10:14.614
Oh, don't look at me like that.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.485
I was right about you and Carol.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.142
Quick question.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.492
Would you be willing
to set yourself on fire?

10:25.015 --> 10:27.017
Wait, are you stalking
Abby's mom on Facebook?

10:27.017 --> 10:28.540
No!

10:28.540 --> 10:29.890
I'm just doing
some light research

10:29.890 --> 10:32.632
so I can have a successful
conversation with her.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.329
Oh, Neil.

10:34.329 --> 10:37.201
Being a person
might not be for you.

10:37.201 --> 10:40.683
Being great with moms
is my thing.

10:40.683 --> 10:43.338
At sleepovers, I didn't care
who Jonah had a crush on.

10:43.338 --> 10:44.948
I wanted to hang
with Mrs. Rayzok

10:44.948 --> 10:48.473
and hear how Mr. Rayzok's
anger management was going.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.040
Not well.

10:51.868 --> 10:53.043
If you want to get
the good dirt,

10:53.043 --> 10:54.349
just use your clerk powers.

10:54.349 --> 10:55.872
Access the state database.

10:55.872 --> 10:58.353
I guess it couldn't hurt
to know some previous addresses.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.703
Wait.
This can't be right.

11:00.703 --> 11:03.880
Abby's mom was convicted
of running a gambling ring?

11:03.880 --> 11:07.057
Dan prosecuted her,
and the judge was Harry Stone.

11:07.057 --> 11:09.712
I bet that's Abby's dad!

11:13.977 --> 11:15.849
You're good.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.548
All moms have secrets, right?

11:19.548 --> 11:21.376
Mine was that
she never wanted me,

11:21.376 --> 11:23.987
although I guess it wasn't
really much of a secret

11:23.987 --> 11:28.209
because it's how she'd kick off
parent-teacher conferences.

11:29.601 --> 11:31.125
We're not going to tell Abby
this, right?

11:31.125 --> 11:32.604
No, of course not.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.258
I know when to not
tell people things.

11:34.258 --> 11:36.565
I won't say anything, either.

11:37.914 --> 11:40.700
Sorry, couldn't help
but overhear.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.223
Wolf ears.

11:47.924 --> 11:50.753
Oops, you spilled.

11:50.753 --> 11:53.625
You seem to be
in a spilling mood tonight.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.977
I needed that to take a pill.

11:56.977 --> 11:59.457
I thought you weren't
going to get involved.

11:59.457 --> 12:00.807
I had to say something.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.765
Abby
deserves to know the truth.

12:02.765 --> 12:06.029
Oh, and what was that story
you told,

12:06.029 --> 12:08.858
two adult strangers
taking a Ferris wheel together?

12:08.858 --> 12:11.078
Ooh-ooh, made you sound
like a couple of creeps.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.080
Creeps?!

12:13.080 --> 12:15.952
I stole that from the back
of a Danielle Steel novel.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.519
I think you're
underestimating your daughter.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.956
She is stronger than you think.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.218
So am I.

12:21.218 --> 12:22.785
You!

12:26.049 --> 12:28.922
Everything alright?

12:28.922 --> 12:31.185
Seem a little nervous
around Gina.

12:31.185 --> 12:32.621
I don't get nervous.

12:32.621 --> 12:33.970
Besides, I hardly know
the woman.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.450
Oh, stop.

12:35.450 --> 12:39.019
I know all about you two
and your secret past,

12:39.019 --> 12:41.499
and unlike the drug-sniffing dog downstairs,

12:41.499 --> 12:42.849
you can't get anything past me.

12:44.546 --> 12:46.026
I don't have anything to hide.

12:46.026 --> 12:48.028
If it was up to me,
Abby would know all of it,

12:48.028 --> 12:50.465
but her mother is against it
for some reason.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.380
Oh, well, I think
I know the reason.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.077
Abby don't want to know that
about her mama.

12:54.077 --> 12:55.862
You should keep it to yourself.
- You know something?

12:55.862 --> 12:57.820
I wouldn't be in this position
if Harry and Gina

12:57.820 --> 12:59.561
had just told her the truth
to begin with.

12:59.561 --> 13:02.303
- Her dad knew?
- Well, of course.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.044
He was there the whole time.

13:04.044 --> 13:06.786
You know, it was just a regular
Tuesday night for us.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.484
Ugh!
Y'all are gross.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.668
Hey, Earth angel.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.497
Where's the sock hop?

13:22.497 --> 13:24.673
I've been approaching this
all wrong.

13:24.673 --> 13:27.632
Gina is a criminal.
She's probably into bad boys.

13:27.632 --> 13:28.895
So, I'm being bad.

13:31.636 --> 13:32.855
Should I just sit
where I was before?

13:32.855 --> 13:35.684
I wouldn't know.
Rules aren't my thing.

13:38.078 --> 13:42.169
Next up, The People vs.
Todd and Missy McMurray.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.345
The McMurrays are charged
with disturbing the peace

13:44.345 --> 13:45.999
outside a bodega
on St. Marks Place.

13:45.999 --> 13:48.436
Your Honor, my clients
were just involved

13:48.436 --> 13:50.090
in a lovers' squabble,
nothing serious.

13:50.090 --> 13:53.441
Some words were exchanged.
Some produce was thrown.

13:53.441 --> 13:56.096
Nothing serious?
It was attempted murder.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.098
She threw garlic at me.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.665
And it's attempted murder
because?

14:00.665 --> 14:02.537
They're vampires.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.627
Vampire drama.

14:05.627 --> 14:08.108
One square away from winning the
money to pay for my dad's Lasik.

14:08.108 --> 14:10.719
Does everyone around here

14:10.719 --> 14:12.939
have an amazing relationship
with their parents?

14:14.070 --> 14:16.029
Your Honor, she started this.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.421
Because I had the nerve
to ask you

14:17.421 --> 14:18.945
where you were the other night?

14:18.945 --> 14:21.121
I was looking for a virgin
to surprise you

14:21.121 --> 14:22.905
for our anniversary.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.038
You think I wanted to go
to a Barenaked Ladies

14:25.038 --> 14:27.083
reunion concert?

14:27.083 --> 14:29.607
You never tell me anything,

14:29.607 --> 14:31.566
like when I have food
in my fangs.

14:31.566 --> 14:34.264
I can't look in a mirror, Todd!

14:36.440 --> 14:40.705
Bunch of weirdos around here.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.490
I'm going to be honest.

14:42.490 --> 14:45.275
I don't care about garlic
or virgins.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.408
But I am very excited to hear
that the Barenaked Ladies

14:47.408 --> 14:49.540
are back together.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.107
At the end of the day,

14:51.107 --> 14:54.632
you two found someone
who accepts you for who you are.

14:54.632 --> 14:57.113
That's special
and worth fighting for.

14:57.113 --> 15:00.203
And since this is your first
offense, the state is willing

15:00.203 --> 15:04.120
to drop the charges if you agree
to couples counseling.

15:04.120 --> 15:08.429
Before you say no, remember,
you're only one "yes" away

15:08.429 --> 15:10.083
from the rest of your life.

15:13.390 --> 15:15.958
- I do still love you.
- I love you, too.

15:18.656 --> 15:21.833
Honey, that was beautiful.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.184
It was like watching
your dad up there.

15:24.184 --> 15:28.405
I mean, you never actually
saw him as a judge.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.016
About that.

15:31.974 --> 15:34.759
Binga!

15:34.759 --> 15:37.197
Criminal hugs judge!

15:37.197 --> 15:39.025
I win! I win!

15:40.200 --> 15:41.984
Criminal?

15:41.984 --> 15:44.334
Hey, not me.
Didn't say a word, nope.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.075
Don't look at me.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.469
I just thought she had the best
sex of her life with Dan.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.515
Why would you think that?

15:51.515 --> 15:52.995
I made it perfectly clear

15:52.995 --> 15:55.693
I was just trying to
get her in handcuffs.

15:55.693 --> 15:58.131
Oh!
Yeah, now I hear it.

15:58.131 --> 16:01.438
Mom, how could you--
Mom?

16:01.438 --> 16:02.918
Alright.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.964
Now that that's out in the open, Neil,

16:04.964 --> 16:06.661
what the hell are you wearing?

16:16.105 --> 16:19.891
Gina Brown operated an illegal
high-stakes poker game

16:19.891 --> 16:21.981
in Hell's Kitchen
for over a year.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.070
Who is this person?

16:24.070 --> 16:26.376
My mom doesn't even watch
the Super Bowl.

16:26.376 --> 16:29.249
We're Puppy Bowl people.

16:29.249 --> 16:32.730
Is this why no one ran
against her for PTA president?

16:32.730 --> 16:36.299
Or why she knew
so many people on "Dateline"?

16:36.299 --> 16:39.520
Feels like questions
you should ask your mother.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.697
Why, so she can just lie
to me more?

16:42.697 --> 16:44.177
You know, I'm not going
to pretend to understand

16:44.177 --> 16:46.309
why your parents
kept this from you.

16:46.309 --> 16:49.878
But, then again, there's a lot
about Harry I didn't understand,

16:49.878 --> 16:53.795
like he would keep rabbits
up his sleeve for hours

16:53.795 --> 16:56.450
just in case
there was a chance of magic.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.889
You give every defendant
who comes in here

17:00.889 --> 17:05.633
a chance to tell their sad,
desperate side of the story.

17:05.633 --> 17:07.896
Don't you think your mother
deserves the same?

17:07.896 --> 17:10.812
I mean, do whatever you want.

17:10.812 --> 17:13.902
I am not going to get involved.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.121
I wouldn't even know
where to find her.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.036
I told her to wait
in the courtroom.

17:18.907 --> 17:21.214
Not involved, starting now.

17:24.608 --> 17:27.089
Honey, can I explain?

17:27.089 --> 17:28.134
First.

17:29.918 --> 17:32.138
Do you swear to tell the truth,

17:32.138 --> 17:34.140
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

17:34.749 --> 17:36.098
I do, Your Honor.

17:39.623 --> 17:43.279
Gina Stone for the defense.
You may proceed.

17:43.279 --> 17:44.933
Okay, first,

17:44.933 --> 17:47.849
I just want to say
your father wanted you to know.

17:47.849 --> 17:50.417
But he respected
that it was my story to tell.

17:50.417 --> 17:53.463
Right.
So, tell it.

17:53.463 --> 17:56.945
It started with a little
poker game at the Jiffy Lube

17:56.945 --> 17:58.512
where my boyfriend worked.

17:59.861 --> 18:04.344
We were riding high on cash
and exhaust fumes.

18:04.344 --> 18:09.610
But things got out of control,
and I ended up here.

18:09.610 --> 18:13.831
Your dad could've
thrown the book at me.

18:13.831 --> 18:20.969
But he saw me the way
I wanted to see myself.

18:21.970 --> 18:24.277
He had a habit of doing that.

18:24.277 --> 18:28.194
After I served my time, I--
I reached out.

18:28.194 --> 18:31.327
Turns out I was on his mind, too.

18:31.327 --> 18:36.202
He wasn't sure about the whole
judge-dating-the-ex-con thing.

18:36.202 --> 18:39.335
But I said,

18:39.335 --> 18:42.817
"You're only one 'yes' away
from the rest of your life."

18:42.817 --> 18:44.645
That was you?

18:45.776 --> 18:48.170
We wanted a fresh start,

18:48.170 --> 18:50.912
so we got married
and moved upstate.

18:50.912 --> 18:53.219
- So, no Ferris wheel?
- Mnh-mnh.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.959
Because I bought you,
like, a thousand Ferris-wheel

18:54.959 --> 18:56.222
Christmas ornaments.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.877
Sorry, I should've told you.

18:59.877 --> 19:02.010
But I was ashamed.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.839
I know what that's like.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.449
When I was struggling,

19:06.449 --> 19:08.364
I did things that I wouldn't
want to tell my kids about.

19:08.364 --> 19:10.366
When I have kids--
I don't have any secret kids.

19:10.366 --> 19:13.195
But if I did, this would be
the time to tell you.

19:13.195 --> 19:16.155
No, I thought I was the only
screw-up in the family.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.331
It's nice to know
that my perfect mom

19:18.331 --> 19:19.680
is as messed up as I am.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.030
Oh!
I'm a huge mess.

19:23.074 --> 19:25.338
There is one other thing.

19:26.861 --> 19:29.951
Abby isn't short for Abigail.

19:29.951 --> 19:32.258
Your real name
is Abracadabra Stone.

19:33.389 --> 19:36.958
I'm sorry.
That one's on your father.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.047
You know what?

19:39.047 --> 19:41.267
I think I've always felt
like an Abracadabra.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.920
Order in the court!

19:42.920 --> 19:45.271
Judge Abracadabra Stone presiding.

19:45.271 --> 19:46.794
I love it.

19:48.404 --> 19:50.232
Hey!

19:52.626 --> 19:56.107
Well, looks like
it all worked out.

19:56.107 --> 19:59.937
You guys made up, and nobody's
mad at me for exposing

19:59.937 --> 20:03.158
for a decades-long family secret
for my own profit.

20:04.638 --> 20:09.251
So, um, what you got there?
Couple hundred bucks?

20:09.251 --> 20:10.731
Uh...

20:10.731 --> 20:12.907
How would you like
to double that?

20:17.346 --> 20:19.130
See, this is why
I don't come down here.

20:21.089 --> 20:23.134
Sorry you didn't transform.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.353
Until tonight,
I didn't even know

20:24.353 --> 20:27.095
there was a glass ceiling
in the wolf world.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.228
But I was rooting
for you to break it.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.317
Thanks for seeing me, Gurgs.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.232
I'll do my best not
to eat you tonight.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.280
What's the matter, Neil?

20:38.280 --> 20:41.762
Did you hit the jukebox,
and it didn't come on?

20:41.762 --> 20:44.591
I blew it with Gina.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.201
My streak is over.

20:46.201 --> 20:47.942
Well, why you care
so much about Gina?

20:47.942 --> 20:49.596
You got a crush on Gina!

20:49.596 --> 20:50.858
What? No.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.599
You got a crush on me!

20:52.599 --> 20:53.991
If I had a crush on you,

20:53.991 --> 20:55.515
I'd be trying
to impress <i>your</i> mom.

20:56.516 --> 20:58.126
You got a crush on Abby!

20:59.301 --> 21:01.303
Oh, no.

21:01.303 --> 21:02.783
I do.

21:02.783 --> 21:05.438
You are so screwed.

21:05.438 --> 21:08.397
But that means my seventh sense
was right.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.312
There was a love connection
in the courtroom.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.401
Gurgs, you cannot tell her.

21:12.401 --> 21:14.316
Well, I can keep a secret,
but I can't speak for Pam.

21:19.843 --> 21:21.976
Oh, you're good.
She got her own stuff going on.
