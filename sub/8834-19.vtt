I hate this, Kit. I hate it!

01:06.166 --> 01:10.291
[Kit] Calm down, Baloo.
We're almost to Louie's.

01:10.375 --> 01:15.750
[Baloo] Honestly, I'm really tired of
these stupid jobs Rebecca keeps giving us.

01:16.542 --> 01:21.792
When we get home, I'm gonna give
our genius boss a piece of my mind.

01:21.875 --> 01:25.458
Ow!
If I have a piece of my mind left.

01:26.375 --> 01:28.458
[bouncing sound]

01:28.542 --> 01:30.500
Fill her up, fellas.

01:36.208 --> 01:38.417
[bouncing]

01:49.083 --> 01:51.458
-[music playing]
-[people chattering]

01:54.500 --> 01:56.375
So get this, Louie,

01:56.458 --> 02:00.500
now Rebecca's got us all
in kangaroos and milk.

02:00.583 --> 02:04.083
She figures we'll have butter
by the time we get home.

02:04.166 --> 02:07.041
Ah, that explains the up and down.

02:08.542 --> 02:12.709
Baby, the Krakatoa Special.
My favorite.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.333
Mmm.

02:14.417 --> 02:16.667
I remember these being tastier.

02:16.750 --> 02:18.417
Ice cream's off, cuz.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.250
You've run up a pretty chunky tab.

02:21.333 --> 02:23.959
And he got pretty chunky
running it up, too.

02:24.041 --> 02:28.542
Now, come on, Louie, I'll pay you
as soon as I get some extra cash.

02:28.625 --> 02:33.500
You know the rule: when the tab gets high,
kiss scoops goodbye.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.291
-Aw, here. On the house.
-Thanks, Louie.

02:40.375 --> 02:42.792
Yeah. You're a real pal.

02:42.875 --> 02:46.333
[chuckles]
The feeling's mutual, cuz.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.959
[Baloo] Nice job, fellas. Here.

03:03.291 --> 03:05.709
[Baloo] Kangaroos... butter.

03:05.792 --> 03:09.500
Rebecca, where do you get
these cockamamie ideas?

03:09.583 --> 03:12.709
[Rebecca]
Hey! We sold a ton of fresh butter.

03:12.792 --> 03:17.625
Butter schmutter. I hit the roof so often
my head still smarts.

03:17.709 --> 03:21.625
I've never heard the word "smarts"
in the same sentence with your head.

03:21.709 --> 03:26.083
[groans] Someday your crazy ideas
are gonna do me in.

03:26.166 --> 03:28.208
Ahh...

03:28.291 --> 03:30.625
My ideas are not crazy.

03:30.709 --> 03:33.125
In fact, today I had my best one yet.

03:33.208 --> 03:36.291
Tomorrow we're going to open,
are you ready?

03:37.500 --> 03:40.083
Our very own gas station!

03:40.166 --> 03:42.709
I think the heat's gotten to her.

03:42.792 --> 03:45.250
It's not the heat, it's the stupidity.

03:45.417 --> 03:49.375
Uh, Miss Cunningham,
Cape Suzette already has gas stations.

03:49.458 --> 03:51.583
Not in the air, it doesn't.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.500
Are you out of your cotton pickin'--

03:53.583 --> 03:56.834
Pilots waste valuable time
refueling on the ground.

03:56.917 --> 03:59.417
They'll pay extra for this convenience.

03:59.500 --> 04:03.500
Midair refueling.
You know, Baloo, that's not a bad--

04:03.583 --> 04:05.417
Forget it. The plan stinks.

04:05.500 --> 04:11.000
-It's dangerous. Unnatural.
-I'm not taking no for an answer.

04:11.083 --> 04:14.166
-Oh, no?
-I'm not taking it for a question either.

04:14.250 --> 04:17.959
-Remember, I'm the boss.
-Like she lets me forget.

04:18.041 --> 04:23.000
Look, just try it one day.
You can keep all the tips.

04:23.083 --> 04:25.375
Hmm, excuse us.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.166
What do you think, kiddo?

04:28.250 --> 04:30.250
We could pay our tab at Louie's.

04:30.375 --> 04:35.125
Then I can get me that Krakatoa Sundae!
OK!

04:35.208 --> 04:36.208
Break.

04:36.291 --> 04:38.083
Tell you what, Rebecca.

04:38.333 --> 04:41.542
We'll do it as a flavor...
I mean, a favor to you.

04:41.625 --> 04:42.667
Good.

04:42.750 --> 04:46.583
Now, the best area to set up shop

04:46.667 --> 04:50.041
is here,
about a tankful away from Cape Suzette.

04:50.125 --> 04:52.583
Baloo, that's near Louie's.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.625
[smacks lips] How convenient.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.792
[humming]

05:00.875 --> 05:01.792
What?

05:03.667 --> 05:04.959
"Running low on fuel?

05:05.041 --> 05:06.417
Don't know what to do?

05:06.500 --> 05:07.458
Then honk your horn, wave hello

05:07.542 --> 05:09.709
and leave it to Baloo!"

05:10.542 --> 05:12.875
[honking]

05:20.917 --> 05:23.208
Our first customer.

05:38.917 --> 05:40.083
[dinging]

05:59.000 --> 06:00.208
[dinging]

06:03.792 --> 06:05.208
[dinging]

06:11.750 --> 06:13.291
That'll be 4.50.

06:13.375 --> 06:16.834
You just saved me a half hour.
Keep the change, kid.

06:17.041 --> 06:19.917
A fiver, thanks!

06:20.166 --> 06:21.125
[dinging]

06:27.625 --> 06:30.750
-Nice work, little britches.
-Thanks.

06:30.834 --> 06:33.417
And look, he liked our service.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.125
-No fooling.
-[honking]

06:35.208 --> 06:37.792
And so will those guys.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.208
Well, no rest for the weary.

06:40.291 --> 06:43.166
It's still a dumb idea.

06:43.250 --> 06:46.375
Now admit it, my idea was good.

06:46.458 --> 06:48.875
Not really. We're out of gas.

06:48.959 --> 06:50.291
That's terrible.

06:50.375 --> 06:53.709
Tell me about it.
Look at these measly tips.

06:53.792 --> 06:57.875
No, I mean, we've got to expand,
carry more gasoline.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.500
-But Rebecca...
-[knocking on door]

07:01.375 --> 07:05.834
-Rebecca Cunningham?
-Uh, the one without the big belly.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.834
I'm from the aviation board,

07:08.917 --> 07:13.041
and we have some problems
with your midair refueling operation.

07:13.125 --> 07:15.792
-Yeah, man!
-Hold it, mister.

07:15.875 --> 07:19.166
I've checked every law.
It is not illegal.

07:19.250 --> 07:23.500
Well, technically, no,
but it's dangerous and unnatural.

07:23.583 --> 07:26.542
Listen, I'm not closing down
a profitable business

07:26.625 --> 07:28.667
just because you have a bad feeling.

07:28.750 --> 07:31.458
Very well. But one slip-up, lady,

07:31.542 --> 07:34.625
and I'll be all over you
like mud on a pig.

07:35.834 --> 07:38.500
[Baloo] Rebecca has the ideas,
but who does the work?

07:38.583 --> 07:42.458
Kit and me, that's who.
Just once, I'd like to have the idea.

07:43.041 --> 07:44.125
[honking]

07:44.208 --> 07:46.583
Hold your courses, we'll be right there.

07:50.709 --> 07:53.375
Here's your change. Good day.

08:00.417 --> 08:02.000
[yawns] No, thanks.

08:02.083 --> 08:05.291
I've got more than I want as it is.

08:05.542 --> 08:10.041
Oh, man.
This place is dead as a rock.

08:10.125 --> 08:14.208
Louie, how about a Krakatoa
for a steady customer?

08:14.291 --> 08:16.875
How about paying your tab?

08:18.542 --> 08:23.917
Baloo! <i>Mon frere, </i> old pal, amigo,
my buddy, <i>paisano, </i> chum!

08:24.000 --> 08:25.625
One Krakatoa coming up.

08:27.500 --> 08:32.166
I don't get it, Baloo.
A couple days ago, business just dried up.

08:32.250 --> 08:37.125
It's funny. You're doing lousy,
but I'm doing fantastic!

08:37.207 --> 08:39.875
Yeah, the money hasn't stopped flowing

08:39.958 --> 08:42.667
since we started
our midair refueling service.

08:48.041 --> 08:50.500
You have a refueling service?

08:50.583 --> 08:54.625
-Yeah. Up there.
-Man, it's a gold mine.

08:57.667 --> 09:00.750
Are you dopes?
You stole all my customers.

09:01.333 --> 09:05.667
-Hey, it was Rebecca's idea.
-But you're going along with it!

09:05.750 --> 09:10.500
Come on, Louie, the skies are free.
I mean, it's nothing personal.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.792
I thought we were pals. Go!

09:12.875 --> 09:15.417
-But my sundae...
-Now!

09:15.500 --> 09:17.959
Come on, little britches.

09:21.250 --> 09:24.875
[Baloo]
All set for another day of petrol patrol?

09:24.959 --> 09:27.750
-Ready as ever.
-Good.

09:27.834 --> 09:28.792
Huh?

09:28.875 --> 09:30.917
"If your plane wants a drink

09:31.000 --> 09:32.583
you'd have to be screwy

09:32.667 --> 09:34.375
to buy gas from a jerk

09:34.458 --> 09:36.667
instead of from Louie!"

09:37.959 --> 09:40.041
Baloo, look.

09:40.208 --> 09:43.875
[Baloo] The nerve of that Louie,
competing with us.

09:55.542 --> 09:57.834
[dinging]

09:58.500 --> 10:02.125
[Baloo] He's got more workers
than Rebecca has dumb ideas.

10:02.208 --> 10:04.583
Best service I've ever had.

10:04.667 --> 10:07.834
Kit, Louie's made a monkey out of me.

10:12.166 --> 10:16.959
So, I guess that's that.
Kit and I go back to being pilots.

10:17.041 --> 10:19.834
Baloo, use your head.

10:19.917 --> 10:22.417
If he can offer better service,
so can we.

10:22.500 --> 10:26.917
But he's got a zillion little guys
running around everywhere.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.458
True, but has he got a mechanic?

10:38.083 --> 10:40.959
-[gasps]
-[chuckles] Hi.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.625
You need a mechanic?

10:42.709 --> 10:47.875
-My engine's making too much noise!
-I can't hear you!

10:47.959 --> 10:51.250
Your engine's making too much noise!
Hold on.

10:59.667 --> 11:02.208
There.
Now what's your problem?

11:02.291 --> 11:03.875
Uh, nothing!

11:04.458 --> 11:06.750
Nothing. Uh, thanks. Here.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.917
Huh? Well, thank you.

11:11.333 --> 11:15.166
[laughs]
Let's see Louie compete with that!

11:15.250 --> 11:21.083
That's right. Lower prices
and a free dish with every fill-up.

11:21.166 --> 11:23.750
[laughs]
Collect the whole set.

11:23.834 --> 11:26.458
Well, Baloo, he did it.

11:26.542 --> 11:28.917
[Rebecca]
Oh, don't be such a quitter, Baloo.

11:29.041 --> 11:34.792
It'll take all our profits,
but this idea will get Louie for sure!

11:36.250 --> 11:40.792
[Baloo] Come one, come all,
to the greatest station in the skies,

11:40.875 --> 11:42.750
Baloo's Lube 'N' Lunch.

11:42.834 --> 11:46.125
That's right.
Eat here and get gas.

11:46.208 --> 11:48.750
Make way for the moola.

11:58.417 --> 11:59.625
Howdy.

11:59.709 --> 12:01.959
So, you like my ad.

12:02.041 --> 12:05.875
Actually, no,
but I've got all the gravy boats I need.

12:05.959 --> 12:10.250
-Is that a good restaurant?
-Four stars and a moon.

12:10.333 --> 12:15.041
-Great! Give me your best meal.
-One hot dog coming up!

12:15.542 --> 12:18.083
[Baloo]
Don't forget your free beach blanket.

12:23.125 --> 12:25.208
Monkey see, monkey do.

12:25.291 --> 12:28.250
That Louie copies every idea I get.

12:28.333 --> 12:31.000
Actually, Baloo, it was Rebecca's idea.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.208
That's not the point.

12:33.291 --> 12:36.000
How do you like them apples, Baloo?

12:36.083 --> 12:41.875
Huh. Since we're new in this neighborhood,
maybe I ought to send a gift.

12:45.125 --> 12:48.041
And another thing.
That Louie... [groans]

12:48.125 --> 12:51.041
I didn't know Louie was a...
[groans]

12:51.125 --> 12:53.291
Must be on his mom's side of the family.

12:53.375 --> 12:57.834
That does it!
Louie, this means war!

13:00.792 --> 13:03.750
How can you be so sure Louie did it?

13:03.834 --> 13:06.500
-[Louie laughing]
-[Baloo] Call it a hunch.

13:06.583 --> 13:09.125
-[honking]
-Baloo, a customer's coming.

13:09.208 --> 13:11.583
And he's all mine.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.417
Gas stations, men.

13:18.041 --> 13:21.959
No barnstorming bear's
gonna bust my business.

13:26.583 --> 13:28.333
I've got the best service, cuz.

13:28.417 --> 13:29.917
[Baloo]
I'll give you lower prices.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.375
-[Louie] I'll give you free lemonade.
-Well, I'm throwing in a free lunch.

13:34.458 --> 13:38.208
-I'm gonna give him a ten-dollar rebate!
-Twenty-dollars!

13:38.291 --> 13:40.125
A month's supply of unleaded!

13:40.208 --> 13:42.792
But... but I don't want unleaded.

13:42.875 --> 13:44.208
[Louie and Baloo] Who asked you?

13:44.291 --> 13:46.875
He's my customer, and that's final!

13:57.125 --> 13:58.834
Hey. Some pump pressure.

14:13.417 --> 14:16.834
Uh, they look kind of backed up.

14:16.917 --> 14:19.667
Maybe you'd better let me
shoot the juice, Bruce.

14:19.750 --> 14:21.583
Perhaps it is best.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.333
I don't get it.

14:24.291 --> 14:25.917
Why, that dirty...

14:27.000 --> 14:28.875
Baloo's a boob and a half.

14:28.959 --> 14:31.083
He'll be out of business real soon.

14:49.417 --> 14:54.834
Flyboy, you're getting the finest fuel
available this side of the other side.

14:54.917 --> 14:56.250
[laughing]

14:56.333 --> 14:58.709
There. Filled to the brim.

14:58.792 --> 15:02.625
You've been pumping my gas, cuz.

15:02.709 --> 15:04.750
Here you go. $5.00.

15:04.834 --> 15:07.250
Hold it, banana breath.

15:07.333 --> 15:08.959
That was my gas!

15:09.041 --> 15:10.166
[grunts]

15:10.250 --> 15:11.709
But I did the pumping.

15:11.792 --> 15:14.875
[groans]
Then I'll do the thumping.

15:15.417 --> 15:17.875
You're getting some of this now.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.333
I've taken all I'm going to take from you.

15:20.417 --> 15:23.834
Well, I am not done dishing it out.

15:23.917 --> 15:25.500
Give it to him, Baloo.

15:31.667 --> 15:36.125
[Louie] I'm tired of you stealing
my business, you bottom-heavy bozo.

15:38.417 --> 15:41.583
Tired?
Why didn't you say so?

15:42.250 --> 15:43.875
[laughing]

15:43.959 --> 15:45.166
[groans]

15:49.417 --> 15:50.500
Good idea.

15:51.291 --> 15:53.500
Hey! Knock off the... [straining]

15:55.041 --> 15:56.709
You say something?

15:56.792 --> 15:58.250
Mm-mm-mmm!

15:58.333 --> 16:00.000
Yee-ha!

16:00.083 --> 16:03.166
Ride him, Louie! [laughing]

16:03.250 --> 16:06.375
Selling food and gas is my territory.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.750
[laughing]

16:08.834 --> 16:10.208
Uh-oh.

16:10.291 --> 16:12.875
[both yelling]

16:12.959 --> 16:14.500
Baloo!

16:19.000 --> 16:21.875
-This is all your fault.
-You started it.

16:21.959 --> 16:23.834
You did. You did.

16:25.375 --> 16:28.166
[both yelling]

16:28.375 --> 16:29.375
Now what do we do?

16:29.458 --> 16:30.750
Stall for time?

16:30.834 --> 16:34.417
In about 20 seconds, we're gonna be
flatter than the funny pages.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.542
-Do something.
-Hey, look, a beach blanket.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.166
Grab the corners.

16:40.208 --> 16:43.417
You know, cuz, this was a great idea.

16:43.625 --> 16:46.208
[Baloo] Yeah, we got it made.

16:48.417 --> 16:53.291
Oh, what happened to us, Louie?
We used to be friends.

16:53.417 --> 16:57.667
I guess we sorta got caught up
in Rebecca's fancy pants idea.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.500
I don't wanna be a gas jockey.

17:00.583 --> 17:04.750
I want open skies.
I want adventure.

17:04.834 --> 17:07.208
[grunts] I want a bandage.

17:07.290 --> 17:11.040
Yeah.
And I'd rather be down here being Louie.

17:11.125 --> 17:14.165
But you can't do that
if I'm still in the sky.

17:14.250 --> 17:17.290
And you can't quit
'cause Rebecca's making a fortune.

17:17.375 --> 17:19.625
Looks like we're stuck being enemies.

17:19.709 --> 17:22.458
Wait a minute. I'm getting an idea.

17:22.541 --> 17:25.875
[chuckles]
I thought I smelled something burning.

17:25.959 --> 17:31.250
We'll go back up there and blow it all up:
lock, stock, and oil barrel.

17:31.333 --> 17:33.750
Your brain should be down any second now.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.125
Don't you get it?

17:35.250 --> 17:39.208
That inspector guy said one slip-up,
and he'll close us down.

17:39.291 --> 17:42.875
So, we cause a slip-up.

17:42.959 --> 17:46.291
When Baloo's Lube 'N' Lunch
goes down in flames,

17:46.375 --> 17:49.166
it'll be banned forever.

17:49.250 --> 17:52.917
Count me in, cuz.
The sooner the better.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.375
How about today at 3:00?

17:55.834 --> 17:58.000
Today? At 3:00?

17:58.083 --> 18:00.000
According to flight regulations,

18:00.083 --> 18:04.166
I have a right to make surprise
inspections of your service station.

18:04.250 --> 18:08.000
[Rebecca] Fine, now you'll see how safe
our Lube 'N' Lunch really is.

18:08.083 --> 18:09.375
[inspector] It better be.

18:09.458 --> 18:14.333
[Baloo laughs] In 15 minutes, we get out
of the sky-high octane business

18:14.417 --> 18:15.959
once and for all.

18:16.041 --> 18:19.250
Now, to put this where
no one will see it.

18:19.333 --> 18:20.709
Ah-ha.

18:24.125 --> 18:25.792
All done, Baloo.

18:25.875 --> 18:28.041
No one will come near the place now.

18:28.125 --> 18:30.542
Monumental.

18:30.625 --> 18:33.667
Come on.
We can watch the fireworks from my place.

18:35.125 --> 18:38.709
[Rebecca] You'll see, inspector.
This operation runs like clockwork.

18:38.792 --> 18:41.625
Closed? They shouldn't be closed.

18:41.709 --> 18:46.792
Ahh... This is the life.

18:46.875 --> 18:50.542
-Hey, Louie, you got any peanuts?
-Coming right up.

18:50.834 --> 18:53.375
Baloo, someone's at the station.

18:53.917 --> 18:57.333
[Baloo] What kind of an idiot
would fly up to a closed station?

18:57.417 --> 19:01.208
-Rebecca.
-She'll be blown to smithereens.

19:01.291 --> 19:03.083
I hate smithereens.

19:03.166 --> 19:06.208
Rebecca! Rebecca!

19:06.291 --> 19:08.250
She's too far away!

19:11.792 --> 19:15.709
Baloo! Baloo!
Where are you hiding?

19:15.792 --> 19:17.250
Ah-ha!

19:17.333 --> 19:20.500
Mrs. Cunningham, would that be your Baloo?

19:20.583 --> 19:22.458
Seems like a friendly sort.

19:22.542 --> 19:24.667
What do you think you're doing?

19:24.750 --> 19:27.000
Get over here! He's the enemy!

19:27.083 --> 19:28.917
-But--
-[Rebecca] Now!

19:29.000 --> 19:32.750
-Excuse me a moment, I have to--
-Yoo-hoo, the customer come first.

19:32.834 --> 19:35.083
-And where's your hat?
-My... my hat?

19:35.166 --> 19:37.417
Right. What will it be?

19:37.500 --> 19:39.667
Gee, they all look so good.

19:39.792 --> 19:41.417
Uh, this... that one.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.458
Good choice.

19:47.709 --> 19:50.500
All full. Have a towel.
I'll put it on your account.

19:50.583 --> 19:53.333
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Hold on, Baloo.

19:53.417 --> 19:56.125
This is a full-service station, remember?

19:56.208 --> 19:57.250
Uh, right.

19:59.458 --> 20:02.709
-Just a minute, Baloo.
-We don't have a minute, Becky.

20:02.792 --> 20:05.333
Inspector, would you like a snack?

20:05.417 --> 20:07.750
Actually, I am a bit peckish.

20:07.834 --> 20:09.166
Baloo.

20:14.250 --> 20:16.834
-Here, can I help you chew that?
-Baloo.

20:16.917 --> 20:20.542
Baloo's gonna get a real close look
at the explosion, huh?

20:20.625 --> 20:22.542
Come on, we'd better go get him.

20:22.625 --> 20:27.000
That was tasty. Well, everything
looks in order, Miss Cunningham.

20:27.083 --> 20:30.333
-I guess we'll be off now.
-It's about time.

20:30.417 --> 20:33.667
Uh, it's about time
I did some more work here.

20:33.750 --> 20:35.208
Bye-bye.

20:35.291 --> 20:38.417
Bye, Baloo! Oh. Nice work.

20:38.500 --> 20:41.625
Uh, thanks. Bye. Bye. Bye!

20:42.583 --> 20:45.375
Hurry! We've got to get there fast!

20:45.458 --> 20:50.000
Relax, Kit. According to my watch,
we still have five minutes.

20:54.041 --> 20:55.208
[ringing]

20:55.291 --> 20:58.041
[Wildcat] Of course, it is my watch
and I am slow.

20:58.917 --> 20:59.834
Where'd he go?

20:59.917 --> 21:02.166
[groans]

21:02.917 --> 21:06.041
[woman on PA]
<i>Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine, Dr. Howard.</i>

21:06.125 --> 21:08.959
They say you're gonna be
all right soon, Baloo.

21:09.041 --> 21:13.083
[chuckles] Yeah, they haven't made
the exploding gas station

21:13.166 --> 21:14.542
that can bring me down.

21:14.625 --> 21:16.458
I brought you a present.

21:17.208 --> 21:21.000
No! No! No fireworks!
Take it away! Take it away!

21:21.083 --> 21:25.917
Kit, don't let Rebecca sell me
any more of her nutsy notions, OK.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Shh. Here she comes.

21:28.083 --> 21:31.166
Oh, poor Baloo.
Does it hurt much?

21:31.250 --> 21:33.000
Uh-huh.

21:33.083 --> 21:36.250
I can't imagine how it blew up like that.

21:36.333 --> 21:39.542
Well, you won't have to worry
about the gas station anymore.

21:39.625 --> 21:42.333
The inspector shut us down, right?

21:42.417 --> 21:45.500
-[Rebecca] Yeah.
-Oh, yeah! Ow!

21:45.583 --> 21:47.458
I mean, too bad.

21:47.542 --> 21:50.458
But don't worry I have another great idea.

21:50.542 --> 21:53.542
-Kit!
-[Rebecca] Milkshakes!

21:53.625 --> 21:56.291
-Milkshakes?
-Milkshakes?

21:56.375 --> 21:59.875
See, we get another kangaroo
and some ice cream,

21:59.959 --> 22:01.625
the shaking mixes the milkshakes,

22:01.709 --> 22:04.041
and you sell them in midair
to thirsty pilots.

22:04.125 --> 22:05.792
What do you think of the name Sky Shakes?

22:05.875 --> 22:09.125
Or Dairy Team?
Over 1,000 served.
