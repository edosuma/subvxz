Brian, I got it!

00:21.188 --> 00:23.624
-Got what?
-The new job that
I applied for in Italy.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.159
-I got it.
-Hey, congratulations, man!

00:26.159 --> 00:27.394
I knew it!
Didn't I tell you?

00:27.394 --> 00:29.296
You think positive,
you test positive!

00:29.296 --> 00:31.298
Preach that
to all my clients.

00:31.298 --> 00:35.068
-Yeah.
-I finally get to leave
the worst job in history--

00:35.068 --> 00:37.504
bad pay, an evil boss.

00:37.504 --> 00:39.540
Oh, before you go,
any suggestions

00:39.540 --> 00:42.609
on what nice thing I can say
to Fat Rob in accounting?

00:42.609 --> 00:46.680
No more office
that thinks being eco-friendly
means having only one toilet,

00:46.680 --> 00:49.182
and a break room
you can't even take a break in.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.419
Then there's Audrey.

00:54.187 --> 00:57.124
Audrey Piatigorsky.
She is perfect.

how lucky he is, you know?

01:32.693 --> 01:35.395
But I've known.
I've known since
my first day at work.

01:35.395 --> 01:37.130
Hi, nice to meet you.

01:37.130 --> 01:41.168
Ooh. I think you have
something on your teeth,
right here.

01:41.168 --> 01:43.003
Oh.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.304
That's when you knew
she was your dream girl?

01:44.304 --> 01:47.374
Man, you come face-to-face
with a hundred people a day,

01:47.374 --> 01:50.243
<i>and nobody says anything</i>
<i>about the spinach</i>
<i>in your teeth.</i>

01:50.243 --> 01:52.145
-Yeah.
-And there's one person...

01:52.145 --> 01:54.414
who actually does
say something.

01:54.414 --> 01:56.183
<i>Well, that's Audrey.</i>

01:56.183 --> 01:58.518
<i>She's different.</i>
<i>She's special.</i>

01:59.586 --> 02:03.490
But she'll never be with me,
and I can't take sitting next
to her every day, man.

02:03.490 --> 02:06.093
It's driving me crazy.
Monday cannot come soon enough.

02:06.093 --> 02:09.262
Huh? You--
You're going Monday?

02:09.262 --> 02:11.231
-Yes.
-Oh, I see what you're doing.

02:11.231 --> 02:14.201
You're telling me at work
so I don't make a scene,

02:14.201 --> 02:15.235
'cause I gotta be professional.

02:15.235 --> 02:16.336
-Brian.
-Don't.

02:17.704 --> 02:21.208
(sighs)
I wish I could
go with you, man.

02:21.208 --> 02:24.111
Living in Los Angeles
always felt like part one
of our friendship,

02:24.111 --> 02:27.047
and you know the sequel
always takes place in Europe.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.683
-I'm sorry.
-Crazy, wrong-side-
of-the-road driving,

02:29.683 --> 02:31.184
topless girls at the beach,

02:31.184 --> 02:33.620
foreign girls that say
my name like this... "Brai-en."

02:33.620 --> 02:37.257
-Dude, you can come visit me.
-I made $400 last year, Kevin.

02:37.257 --> 02:40.193
-Where am I going?
-Okay, well, I'm coming
home for Christmas.

02:40.193 --> 02:43.230
I got it! You miss
your flight 'cause
of a snowstorm.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.499
Uh-oh, a fake Santa Claus
steals all of our gifts.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.467
And guess what.
In the end,

02:47.467 --> 02:50.270
you know we're
gonna learn that life lesson
about the power of friendship.

02:50.270 --> 02:53.073
This is gonna work.
(kisses) Let's go.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.575
-Come here.
-(theme music playing)

03:01.214 --> 03:05.452
(cell phone ringing)

03:08.021 --> 03:10.190
-(sighs)
-(beeps)

03:10.190 --> 03:12.292
-Hello?
-Are you so excited?

03:12.292 --> 03:15.095
I'm so excited.
I already love Los Angeles,

03:15.095 --> 03:17.531
and I'm only in
San Bernan-dinano or whatever.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.233
Moving on a whim
was the perfect plan, Kev.

03:20.233 --> 03:21.501
<i>Are you so excited?</i>
<i>I'm so excited.</i>

03:21.501 --> 03:23.036
I actually am excited.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.172
I got a new job in Italy,

03:25.172 --> 03:27.274
so I am moving out.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.242
What? Kev, that's amazing!

03:29.242 --> 03:30.677
This works out kind
of perfectly, 'cause--

03:30.677 --> 03:32.345
Can I be like
a thousand percent honest?--

03:32.345 --> 03:34.247
I didn't really wanna share
an apartment with you.

03:34.247 --> 03:35.682
You're my brother
and I love you,

03:35.682 --> 03:37.551
but like a million
percent honest,

03:37.551 --> 03:39.586
I thought it'd be super weird
when I brought guys back there.

03:39.586 --> 03:41.588
<i>And guess what.</i>
<i>That is happening.</i>

03:41.588 --> 03:44.424
-Probably kind of a lot.
-Okay, Roxanne.

03:44.424 --> 03:46.993
Ooh! Roxie.
Roxanne sounds slutty.

03:46.993 --> 03:49.596
Oh, I gotta go, Kev.
I'm gonna flash my boobs
at this cute guy.

03:49.596 --> 03:53.166
Hey, you! Can you tell
your kids to cover their eyes?

03:57.370 --> 04:00.140
-(chuckles)
-So, it's true?

04:00.140 --> 04:05.078
-(drawer shuts)
-Yes, I... I quit.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.281
No, that you have
a weird paper clip
and binder fetish.

04:08.281 --> 04:11.318
-Everyone's been
talking about it.
-(both laugh)

04:11.318 --> 04:15.021
Yeah, well...
Yeah, no-- no fetishes here.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.358
Unless my partner's into that,
and then, you know,

04:18.358 --> 04:19.693
put me in pigtails,
give me a lollipop,

04:19.693 --> 04:21.661
and let's start
changing some diapers.

04:23.196 --> 04:25.298
Yeah, that stuff is weird.

04:26.566 --> 04:29.102
So weird.
I don't know why I said that.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.439
-It's so...
-Hey, guys, lay low.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.241
Julia's handing out
a crappy account--

04:34.241 --> 04:36.443
Dreyerson Nursing Home
and Hospice Spa.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.211
Nothing but Ensures
and seltzers,

04:38.211 --> 04:40.280
it's way out
in the boonies,
and it reeks.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.250
Ricky! That is not
your business!

04:43.250 --> 04:44.284
Sorry, boss!

04:44.284 --> 04:47.254
Like, urine with a dash
of hummus or something.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.055
It's real bad smell
over at Dryerson.

04:49.055 --> 04:51.258
-Oh, that is so gross, Ricky.
-Hey, a bunch of us

04:51.258 --> 04:53.593
-wanna get together
in your honor tonight.
-Oh, you guys don't--

04:53.593 --> 04:56.096
-How fun!
-Sure, great. Where? When?

04:56.096 --> 04:57.697
-Oh, I wish I could go.
-What?

04:57.697 --> 05:00.267
Brock has
his big tournament tonight.
It's regionals.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.402
Or is it semi-regionals?
Or is it semi-final
regionals?

05:02.402 --> 05:04.304
Is there such a thing
as regional regionals?

05:04.304 --> 05:07.407
-Nope. That'd be weird.
-You're so devoted.

05:07.407 --> 05:10.010
Craftworks Gastropub
and Tapas Bar.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.745
Six o'clock.
It's gonna be epic,

05:11.745 --> 05:15.348
especially if
we can get a booth
by the air conditioner.

05:15.348 --> 05:17.317
(rock music playing)

05:21.354 --> 05:23.190
Brian:
I'm gonna be fine
without you here.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.592
Me and Ricky,
we gonna turn it up!

05:26.660 --> 05:28.662
So, what you gonna do
with all your old furniture?

05:28.662 --> 05:31.364
-You gonna give it away or...?
-Oh, I was gonna leave it
for my sister.

05:31.364 --> 05:34.000
-I'm sorry, man.
-Pssh! Don't be, okay?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.369
I look like
the type of guy that wants
hand-me-down furniture?

05:36.369 --> 05:38.138
Uh-uhh!

05:38.138 --> 05:39.406
What you gonna do
with all your old clothes?

05:39.406 --> 05:41.141
You gonna give those away?

05:42.209 --> 05:44.678
-(wind gusts)

05:46.980 --> 05:48.515
I'm coming, Ricky!

05:59.326 --> 06:01.161
(music slows, stops)

06:01.161 --> 06:03.463
-(rock music playing)
-Kevin! You guys are still here!

06:03.463 --> 06:07.234
I thought
you guys couldn't make it.
The finals or whatev--

06:07.234 --> 06:09.102
Quarter regional finals
of the semis.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.071
Kicked ass
in record speed.
Pow, pow!

06:11.071 --> 06:13.506
-(laughs) Yeah.
-Couldn't have done it
without her.

06:13.506 --> 06:15.275
-She paid my entrance fee.
-She...

06:20.313 --> 06:23.316
-Come on, babe, let's dance.
-Oh! (laughing)

06:23.316 --> 06:25.252
Whoo!

06:27.654 --> 06:33.426
Mmm! Looks like
the quarterback needs
a chaperon for the prom.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.362
Hey, get lost!
Score some weed!

06:38.465 --> 06:40.467
Kevin! Come on!

06:40.467 --> 06:41.968
Oh, no, no, no.
I can't.

06:41.968 --> 06:44.604
Aww! You'll never see
any of us ever again!

06:44.604 --> 06:49.442
(ballad playing)

06:50.977 --> 06:52.412
So, what's your new job?

06:52.412 --> 06:55.282
Well, it's still
in food supply,

06:55.282 --> 06:59.519
but... it's a little closer
to what I actually want
to be doing.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.622
Which is...?

07:02.622 --> 07:05.358
-Oh, you wanna hear that too?
-(both laugh)

07:05.358 --> 07:08.528
Wow. We are--
We are really talking here.

07:10.230 --> 07:13.099
I, uh...

07:13.099 --> 07:16.536
I wanna own like a little hotel
or something someday.

07:17.570 --> 07:20.440
You know,
the whole hospitality thing.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.742
Well, you'd be
so good at that.

07:22.742 --> 07:25.312
I mean, you're always
taking care of everyone.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.349
I'm really gonna miss
you taking care of me.

07:33.320 --> 07:37.257
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm great. I'm great.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.660
My goodbye party.
I'm saying goodbye.

07:43.430 --> 07:45.365
Why wouldn't that be great?

07:45.365 --> 07:47.968
Okay, I'll drop it.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.603
But you know you can
tell me things, right?

07:50.603 --> 07:55.141
I mean, we have shared
a crappy cubicle wall
for three years, after all.

07:55.141 --> 07:58.578
(ballad continues playing)

07:58.578 --> 08:00.146
Audrey...

08:02.415 --> 08:05.552
Actually, there is something
I do wanna tell you.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.053
What is it?

08:08.521 --> 08:10.090

08:10.090 --> 08:13.760

What happened last night?

Oh, I stayed
with a guy

09:26.266 --> 09:29.436
who is the cousin
of a guy that I dated
in high school.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.337
Well, I mean,
I was in high school,

09:31.337 --> 09:33.139
he was just finishing up
community college...

09:33.139 --> 09:36.209
or community service.
By the way, those are
not the same thing.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.446
Why is your furniture
still here?

09:39.446 --> 09:41.714
I was leaving it for you,
so you wouldn't have to buy any.

09:41.714 --> 09:45.418
-Oh, that's so
super sweet of you.
-No, no.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.487
-(both grunt)
-But this is the kind of stuff

09:47.487 --> 09:51.091
you leave on the curb,
and you see a drunk person
passed out on it the next day.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.461
But this drunk person
is gonna be passed out
on something way nicer.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.729
Roxie, I'm feeling weird
about leaving you.

09:56.729 --> 09:59.566
I mean, you're
a little too immature to be
out here on your own.

09:59.566 --> 10:03.136
-I can't believe Mom
is okay with this.
-I am very mature, okay?

10:03.136 --> 10:06.039
And when Mom realizes
I'm not in my room,
I'll text her for sure.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.207
Okay, I'm gonna
give her a call.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.309
She wanted to know
my flight info anyway.

10:09.309 --> 10:12.512
Kev, get on that.
God, the poor woman's
probably panicked.

10:12.512 --> 10:15.081

new company in Italy.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.183

"that unseasonably
warm weather

10:23.423 --> 10:25.558
"has adversely affected
the truffle crop.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.660
"As such,
we no longer need

10:27.660 --> 10:29.596
"a truffle oil
and sea salt manager."

10:32.265 --> 10:35.568
But I was gonna be
the truffle oil
and sea salt manager.

10:35.568 --> 10:36.703
(hip-hop music playing)

10:36.703 --> 10:39.539
I can't believe
that job fell through!

10:39.539 --> 10:41.574
Now I have to live
with my stupid sister

10:41.574 --> 10:43.710
and beg to get
my stupid job back.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.579
Hey, man, at least
you get to reunite
with your stupid best friend.

10:46.579 --> 10:49.582
-What's up?
-I bet Audrey
hates me right now.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.619
I got so drunk last night,
I probably made a total idiot
out of myself.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.354
-Mmm.
-You know, it's funny.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.989
I don't know
exactly what I did,

10:55.989 --> 10:58.024
but for some reason,
I don't feel like

10:58.024 --> 11:01.227
all my feelings for Audrey
are all bottled up anymore.

11:01.227 --> 11:03.596
Oh, that's the release
that comes from getting
a hooker.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.031
It's a very distinct feeling.

11:05.031 --> 11:07.300
It's kinda like a caterpillar
coming out of its egg.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.203
I did not get a hooker.
I just feel, like, at peace.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.272
You didn't drunk-dial her,
did you?

11:13.540 --> 11:15.608
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.043
Please no,
please no.

11:17.043 --> 11:19.345
(sighs deeply)
Thank God.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.081
-No calls.
-Okay.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.352
(ominous music playing)

11:32.158 --> 11:33.293
Oh!

11:39.666 --> 11:42.602
Email. "Dear Audrey,

11:42.602 --> 11:45.305
-"I've wanted to get
something off my chest."
-(chimes)

11:46.573 --> 11:48.675
Die, Smart Type!
(grunts)

11:52.045 --> 11:54.214
-(beeps)
-(grunts)

11:54.214 --> 11:56.482
We'll do it
the old-fashioned way.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.655
(grunts)

12:05.124 --> 12:06.159
Garbage.

12:07.527 --> 12:10.363
Nobody says that.

12:10.363 --> 12:13.266
(ethereal music playing)

12:29.415 --> 12:32.385
(lid squeaks, clunks)

12:32.385 --> 12:34.220
(hip-hop music playing)

12:34.220 --> 12:35.455
Oh no.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.090
What?

12:41.060 --> 12:42.462
Come on,
come on, come on.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.731
Yup. No! My tie.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.399
(shouts angrily)

12:46.399 --> 12:49.202
(tires screech)

12:53.273 --> 12:55.375
I'm sorry, I have to--

12:55.375 --> 12:57.377
Sorry, big fella,
just gonna get--

12:57.377 --> 12:59.512
Hi. This can
probably wait. Sure.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.281
Hi. Good morning.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.383
I have a mail emergency.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.653
I accidentally
mailed a letter
to a girl.

13:06.653 --> 13:09.422
It was very stupid,
I was very drunk,

13:09.422 --> 13:12.158
and I really need
to get it back.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.065
Okay. I can tell
you are not gonna

13:19.065 --> 13:21.234
help me with this,
are you?

13:21.234 --> 13:23.503
Of course I'll help.
No problem.

13:23.503 --> 13:26.306
-(truck beeping)
-Oh my God, thank you.
Thank you so much.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.341
You know,
if you don't mind my saying,

13:28.341 --> 13:30.743
you're not like
I expected you to be.

13:30.743 --> 13:34.080
Sassy, right?
You expected me to be sassy.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.416
Well, not all big,
black women

13:36.416 --> 13:40.353
act as if they
should play a judge
in a Jason Segel movie, right?

13:40.353 --> 13:43.089
I was not thinking--
Yes, I was.

13:44.223 --> 13:47.427
-(revving)
-No, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no, no!

13:47.427 --> 13:49.495
No! Please stop!

13:52.398 --> 13:55.468
Two more seconds.
I-- wait, I--

13:55.468 --> 13:58.304
There was another woman here
who was gonna help me

13:58.304 --> 14:01.007
find a letter
that I accidentally
mailed to a girl.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.109
Maybe she--
Could she come back?

14:03.109 --> 14:06.179
She could.
She could even eat a salad
for lunch if she wanted,

14:06.179 --> 14:07.513
but she's not going to.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.248
So, why don't you
run along, little man?

14:09.248 --> 14:11.984
Oh, next time, just do
what the rest of us do--

14:11.984 --> 14:14.354
text her a pic
of your junk.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.090
-You're the sassy one?
-Mm-hmm.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.160
Here's my problem--
I don't have the $800

14:21.160 --> 14:23.730
that it would take
for me to get my car out
of your tow yard, so...

14:24.997 --> 14:26.999
Please, sir,
don't make me beg.

14:27.967 --> 14:30.536
Let a man keep
his dignity. Hello?

14:31.537 --> 14:34.440
-(sighs)
-You look weird
on that baby bed.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.676
It's not a baby bed.
It's a Utenglock Grow-With-Me.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.378
And since you're not
giving me my room back,

14:38.378 --> 14:40.747
I had to buy the only thing
that would fit out here.

14:40.747 --> 14:43.116
How am I gonna face Audrey
at work tomorrow?

14:43.116 --> 14:44.450
Come on,
what are you worried about?

14:44.450 --> 14:46.486
She won't even have
your lame love letter yet.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.056
Oh my God, you're right.
There's no way she
would get her mail

14:50.056 --> 14:52.525
before she left
for work tomorrow.
I can undo this!

14:52.525 --> 14:54.060
I just have to go
to her apartment tomorrow

14:54.060 --> 14:56.062
and plead with the mailman
to give it to me!

14:56.062 --> 14:59.499
After I go into work
and plead with Julia
to give me my job back.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.168
Okay, Kevin,
you're like family.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.637
No, better than family.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.206
-You came
to my intervention.
-Yes, I did,

15:07.206 --> 15:10.543
and I promise I will...
be at the next one.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.413
Mmm. You are saying
all the right things.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.149
I'll let you know.

15:16.149 --> 15:19.252
You'll let me know.
So, maybe. Okay.
Thank you.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.721
(shudders)

15:25.024 --> 15:27.093
(snapping fingers)

15:27.093 --> 15:29.262
Audrey:
Kevin? Are you still here?

15:29.262 --> 15:31.264
Aren't you supposed
to be in Italy?

15:31.264 --> 15:35.134
Yeah, that, uh...
that job actually
fell through.

15:35.134 --> 15:37.570
Oh, Kevin.
I'm so sorry.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.039
Don't be, don't be.
I don't even really
like truffles.

15:40.039 --> 15:41.474
They smell like farts.

15:44.210 --> 15:47.380
Anyway, I think that Julia
will probably let me stay

15:47.380 --> 15:50.716
once she sees
how committed
to the job I am.

15:50.716 --> 15:54.520
I'll see you later.
I'm gonna take the rest
of the day off.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.023
Whoa!
Uh, what are you doing?

15:57.023 --> 15:59.425
I have a horrible headache.
Julia said I could go home

15:59.425 --> 16:01.994
if I came in early tomorrow
and walked on her back.

16:01.994 --> 16:04.096
No! No, you don't
want to do that.

16:04.096 --> 16:06.732
She... flips over
in the middle of it.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.668
I'm gonna find you
some aspirin. Come on.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.270
Here you go.
Feel better,

16:11.270 --> 16:14.474
and-- and stay--
stay here.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.609
Are you acting like
a freak because of me?

16:16.609 --> 16:18.478
Did I do something?

16:18.478 --> 16:20.746
-(people chattering)
-(Ricky whispers)
Go, go, go, go!

16:20.746 --> 16:23.449
-What-- What's happening?
-Everyone's hiding out.

16:23.449 --> 16:25.518
Julia needs someone
to watch her cat this weekend.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.653
-Thanks for the heads up.
-It's 23 years old.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.489
You have to do
dialysis on it.

16:31.057 --> 16:33.459
-I'm not acting--
-Do you have feelings
for me, Kevin?

16:35.528 --> 16:36.696
Wait.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.598
What? Do...

16:38.598 --> 16:41.534
Do I have...
feelings for you?

16:41.534 --> 16:44.103
Yeah. I didn't think so,

16:44.103 --> 16:45.538
but I promised
Brock I'd ask.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.373
Just forget I said anything.

16:47.373 --> 16:49.609
He's-- He's being sponsored
by a new protein shake,

16:49.609 --> 16:51.444
and it's getting him
really revved up.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.148
You trying to steal
my girlfriend?

16:56.148 --> 16:58.050
-(grunts)
-(people gasp)

16:59.552 --> 17:02.021
What? Is this yours?

17:05.057 --> 17:06.259
-(shouts) I gotta go!
-(people gasp)

17:06.259 --> 17:08.160
-(whispers) I'm so sorry.
-Really?

17:15.501 --> 17:17.303
-(tires screech)
-(honks horn)

17:25.478 --> 17:28.548
Excu...
Is that my tie?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.583
Oh, I'll take mine. 2A.

17:31.984 --> 17:34.687
Wait. 2A-- that's
Audrey Piatigorsky's apartment.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.756
-Who are you?
-I need that. That's not yours.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.491
Uh, it is so mine.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.593
I'm her roommate,
this is my mail,

17:40.593 --> 17:42.662
and if you take it from me,
that's called mail fraud.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.631
-My dad's a lawyer.
-Please, I just-- I need
to see one thing,

17:45.631 --> 17:47.166
and then I will give
it back. I promise.

17:47.166 --> 17:48.534
No! You're gonna
steal my identity!

17:48.534 --> 17:50.536
My dad's a lawyer!

17:52.238 --> 17:53.472
I'm feeling unsafe.

17:53.472 --> 17:55.741
You give off a very
sexual-predator vibe.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.578
Me? No. No, I don't.
I said please.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.613
Okay, my dad's a lawyer.
I think I know what

18:00.613 --> 18:03.282
a sexual predator is,
and you fit the profile--

18:03.282 --> 18:05.284
aggressive, desperate...

18:07.253 --> 18:11.123
-Attractive.
-Whoa! Whoa!
What are you doing?

18:11.123 --> 18:13.559
Are you saying
you don't want me?

18:13.559 --> 18:17.430
I'm not-- I did--
I didn't-- I'm not-- I...

18:17.430 --> 18:20.299
(rock music playing)

18:23.703 --> 18:25.638
It's not just
your identity I'm after.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.507
Oh. Give it to me!

18:28.507 --> 18:30.576
-(both moaning)
-Oh God!

18:34.013 --> 18:35.481
(grunts)

18:35.481 --> 18:38.284
No, I won't make love with you
in my apartment, beast!

18:38.284 --> 18:40.286
-(loud slap)
-Aah!

18:40.286 --> 18:42.388
-Did that hurt?
-What's the right answer?

18:42.388 --> 18:43.723
Get up!

18:45.625 --> 18:47.126
What are you gonna do?

18:50.363 --> 18:52.765
(vocalizing tune)

18:55.401 --> 18:57.370
I just need
some water.

18:57.370 --> 19:00.506
Not too much.
I don't want you to spit it up
when we get going again.

19:02.642 --> 19:06.612
Oh, and can you bring me
one of those 100-calorie
Brownie Bite packets?

19:06.612 --> 19:08.280
-Okay.
-Oh no, two!

19:08.280 --> 19:09.281
Okay!

19:18.190 --> 19:19.725
(cries)

19:30.269 --> 19:31.370
No, no, no.

19:32.371 --> 19:33.506
Babe?

19:34.507 --> 19:35.675
Kevin.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.510
What are you doing here?

19:37.510 --> 19:38.511
This came for you.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.989
(pop music playing)

19:54.694 --> 19:56.696
Hey, guys.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.564
Have you seen
my new boyfriend?

19:58.564 --> 20:01.667
He's cute, blue eyes...
or brown eyes,

20:01.667 --> 20:04.537
a little banged up.
Looks like a model.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.673
