WEBVTT

00:17.208 --> 00:20.083
JOEY.
STILL STUDYING.

00:20.083 --> 00:21.667
HOW COME YOU DON'T
WANT TO GET WITH ME?

00:21.667 --> 00:24.000
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING ON ABOUT?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.959
SINCE I'VE BEEN BACK,
NOTHING. NADA.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.083
A DROUGHT
OF EPIC PROPORTIONS.

00:28.083 --> 00:29.166
IS THERE A HYGIENE ISSUE
I'M NOT AWARE OF?

00:32.000 --> 00:34.125
AUDREY?
HI, BUNNY!

00:34.125 --> 00:36.959
OH, MY GOD!
HI!

00:36.959 --> 00:39.917
OHH, YOU FLUNKED OUT
OF SCHOOL. HOW SAD.

00:39.917 --> 00:41.041
DEATH OF A DREAM
AND ALL THAT.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.708
SO, GUESS WHO WAS
ON MY PLANE?

00:42.708 --> 00:43.542
AUDREY, YOU'RE BACK
A DAY EARLY.

00:43.542 --> 00:44.959
YEAH, I GOT EARLY PAROLE
FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR.

00:44.959 --> 00:46.625
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THE RUMOR HAS IT

00:46.625 --> 00:48.834
THAT COURTNEY LOVE WAS
CHECKING IN, AND THEY
NEEDED THE EXTRA ROOM.

00:48.834 --> 00:50.208
SO, GUESS WHO WAS
ON MY FLIGHT.

00:50.208 --> 00:52.750
PILOTS, STEWARDESSES,
AND ASSORTED PASSENGERS?

00:52.750 --> 00:53.875
WELL, THAT'S FUNNY,
BUT NO.

00:53.875 --> 00:57.834
I'M ONLY TALKING ABOUT
THE SEXIEST MAN
IN ALL OF AMERICA.

00:57.834 --> 01:00.792
AUDREY, DON'T YOU WANT
TO MAYBE RELAX, GET SETTLED?

01:00.792 --> 01:01.708
OH, COME ON. NO ONE'S
EVER TOO BUSY FOR

01:01.708 --> 01:03.250
A QUICK GAME OF "GUESS
WHO WAS ON MY PLANE."

01:03.250 --> 01:04.542
TRUST ME, THIS ONE'S
REALLY GOOD.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.542
OK, FINE. UH, UH, UH...

01:06.542 --> 01:08.250
BRAD PITT?
(SIGHS)

01:08.250 --> 01:08.708
WILL YOU WORK WITH ME,
POTTER?

01:08.708 --> 01:10.542
THAT IS SO OBVIOUS.

01:10.542 --> 01:11.458
NO, THIS GUY
IS WAY HOTTER.

01:11.458 --> 01:13.625
I'M TALKING LIKE
THE THINKING GIRL'S
DREAM.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.250
OH, IAN ZIERING?

01:15.250 --> 01:18.708
(BOTH LAUGH)

01:18.708 --> 01:20.583
DUH. DR. DREW.

01:20.583 --> 01:23.208
IMPRESSIVE.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.417
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE WAS
A LITTLE TOO, UH...

01:25.417 --> 01:26.917
CLINICAL FOR YOUR TASTES.

01:26.917 --> 01:28.333
IT'S KIND OF
A REHAB THING.

01:28.333 --> 01:29.583
YOU START
TO CRAVE MEN BASED ON

01:29.583 --> 01:31.041
WHO'D LOOK CUTEST
IN A WHITE LAB COAT.

01:31.041 --> 01:32.041
WHO'S DR. DREW?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

01:32.041 --> 01:35.250
YOU KNOW. DR. DREW
AND ADAM CAROLLA?

01:35.250 --> 01:37.708
OF LOVELINE  FAME?

01:37.708 --> 01:39.375
POPULAR RADIO CALL-IN
SHOW WHERE THEY ESPOUSE

01:39.375 --> 01:42.125
ADVICE TO PATHETIC
LOSERS WITH MASSIVE
SEXUAL HANG-UPS.

01:42.125 --> 01:43.417
HE USED TO BE ON MTV.

01:43.834 --> 01:46.500
UHH. JEEZ LOUISE.

01:46.500 --> 01:47.917
LOOKS LIKE
MR. GOODWRENCH
HAS BEEN TOO BUSY

01:47.917 --> 01:49.333
THROWING HIS BACK
INTO HIS LIVING

01:49.333 --> 01:51.000
TO SOAK UP A LITTLE
POP CULTURE.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.083
WHAT'S MTV?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.750
KIDDING.

01:55.750 --> 01:58.750
SO ANYWAY,
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

01:58.750 --> 02:01.917
WELL, PRETTY GOOD,
CONSIDERING THEY'RE GOING
TO BE AT BOSTON BAY TOMORROW.

02:01.917 --> 02:04.708
WH-WH-WHAT?

02:04.708 --> 02:06.125
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE I BEEN?

02:06.125 --> 02:07.625
OH, RIGHT.
I'VE BEEN IN REHAB.

02:07.625 --> 02:10.542
YEAH, THEY'RE PUTTING ON
SOME FUND RAISER FOR
THE COUNSELING CENTER,

02:10.542 --> 02:11.542
AND JEN GETS TO PLAY HOST.

02:11.542 --> 02:13.166
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS PERFECT.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.125
SHE CAN TOTALLY
INTRO ME TO THE DOC.

02:14.125 --> 02:17.000
I KNEW IT WAS DESTINY.
I GOTTA PEE.

02:26.291 --> 02:30.750
SHE'S BAAAAAACK.

02:30.750 --> 02:31.250
(BOTH LAUGH)

03:32.291 --> 03:35.458
IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK
THAT WE INVEST IN SOME
CORDLESS PHONES AROUND HERE?

03:37.291 --> 03:39.458
YOU EXCITED ABOUT
THE HOSTING GIG TONIGHT?

03:39.458 --> 03:41.625
MM-HMM.
YEAH?

03:41.625 --> 03:44.166
WHO KNOWS? YOU COULD
BECOME THE NEXT
RYAN SEACREST.

03:44.166 --> 03:46.375
YOU COULD BORROW
ONE OF HIS MAN-BLOUSES.

03:50.041 --> 03:51.500
SOMETHING WRONG?
YOU SEEM A LITTLE TENSE.

03:54.208 --> 03:55.875
NO, I'M REALLY NOT.
I'M FINE.

03:57.708 --> 03:58.250
COME HERE.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.708
SIT DOWN.
NO, THAT'S OK.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.333
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

04:05.083 --> 04:06.834
THERE, DOESN'T THAT
FEEL BETTER?

04:06.834 --> 04:07.834
SO I WAS THINKING,

04:07.834 --> 04:10.542
AFTER TONIGHT'S SOIREE,

04:10.542 --> 04:13.417
YOU AND I CAN SLIP
BACK TO MY PLACE FOR
A LITTLE NIGHTCAPPER?

04:13.417 --> 04:16.750
YOU, ME,
SOME CHEAP CHAMPAGNE,
A LITTLE FLEETWOOD MAC.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.750
I CAN'T.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.083
OK, NO FLEETWOOD MAC.

04:20.083 --> 04:23.125
NO, UM...

04:23.125 --> 04:24.125
IT'S NOT THAT.

04:24.125 --> 04:26.542
I MEAN, I JUST...
I CAN'T. I CAN'T.

04:26.542 --> 04:27.583
WHY NOT?

04:29.750 --> 04:30.417
I HAVE TO HELP GRAMS.

04:30.417 --> 04:33.291
I CAN HELP GRAMS.
LET ME COME.

04:35.083 --> 04:35.750
I DON'T THINK THAT'S
A VERY GOOD IDEA.

04:35.750 --> 04:38.250
WHY NOT?

04:40.125 --> 04:41.417
BECAUSE, C.J.,
I'M BREAKING UP WITH YOU.
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

04:46.625 --> 04:47.417
JOEY?

04:50.625 --> 04:52.041
YES, EDDIE?

04:52.041 --> 04:54.125
UM, WE NEVER GOT
A CHANCE TO FINISH
OUR CONVERSATION.

04:54.125 --> 04:56.708
AND WHAT CONVERSATION
WAS THAT?

04:56.708 --> 04:58.667
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE
REPULSED BY ME.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.291
I AM NOT REPULSED
BY YOU.

05:00.291 --> 05:01.667
THEN WHY WON'T
YOU GET WITH ME?

05:01.667 --> 05:03.625
WOULD YOU STOP SAYING
"GET WITH ME?"

05:03.625 --> 05:04.917
IT'S CREEPING ME OUT.

05:04.917 --> 05:06.458
SORRY.

05:06.458 --> 05:07.792
AND I...

05:07.792 --> 05:08.708
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.959
WHAT?

05:10.959 --> 05:13.542
YOU KNOW.

05:13.542 --> 05:15.291
WHAT, SEX? YOU DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT SEX?

05:15.291 --> 05:16.458
NO!
WHY?

05:19.834 --> 05:21.959
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST...

05:21.959 --> 05:23.041
I DON'T.

05:23.041 --> 05:25.500
OH, I GET IT.
I UNDERSTAND.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.250
I REPULSE YOU.

05:31.417 --> 05:32.834
YOU DON'T REPULSE ME.

05:32.834 --> 05:34.875
IT'S OK.

05:34.875 --> 05:37.291
THIS HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE.

05:37.291 --> 05:37.834
IT HAS?

05:37.834 --> 05:40.000
NO.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.291
EDDIE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:42.291 --> 05:44.166
YOU DON'T GET ANYWHERE
TALKING ABOUT SEX.

05:44.166 --> 05:46.834
YOU JUST MAKE ME
UNCOMFORTABLE.

05:46.834 --> 05:47.291
CLEARLY.

05:47.291 --> 05:50.166
OH, MY SWEET LORD!

05:50.166 --> 05:52.875
WILL THE TWO OF YOU
JUST DO IT ALREADY
AND BE QUIET?

05:52.875 --> 05:55.250
I HAVE TO GO.
I HAVE A QUIZ.

05:55.250 --> 05:57.708
WELL, FINE. MAYBE WE CAN
NOT TALK ABOUT THIS LATER.

05:57.708 --> 05:59.917
Joey: GLADLY.

06:04.959 --> 06:07.583
(DOOR CLOSES)

06:07.583 --> 06:08.834
DO YOU WANT
TO MAKE OUT?

06:10.417 --> 06:11.792
NO.

06:12.166 --> 06:15.667
(LAUGHS) GOOD.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.375
THAT WAS YOUR
TEST, BUDDY.

06:17.375 --> 06:18.375
YOU BREAK
HER HEART AGAIN,

06:18.375 --> 06:20.208
AND I'M GOING
TO KILL YOU.
YOU GOT IT?

06:20.208 --> 06:21.583
YEAH.

06:32.542 --> 06:34.041
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

06:34.041 --> 06:35.875
HI.
HI.

06:35.875 --> 06:39.000
SO, IS THERE, LIKE,
ASSIGNED SEATS,
OR HOW DOES THIS WORK?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.375
NO, IT'S GENERAL ADMISSION.
FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED.

06:41.375 --> 06:44.542
GREAT. SO IF I WANTED
TO SIT BY SOMEONE
SPECIFIC,

06:44.542 --> 06:46.375
THE BEST WAY WOULD
JUST BE TO ASK HIM?

06:46.375 --> 06:47.917
UH, YEAH.

06:47.917 --> 06:51.750
SO...YOU GOING
WITH ANYBODY?

06:51.750 --> 06:53.125
ME?

06:53.125 --> 06:55.125
YEAH. IS THAT A PROBLEM?

06:55.125 --> 06:59.375
OH, WELL...UH, NO...

06:59.375 --> 07:02.375
NORMALLY, I WOULDN'T MIND,
BUT, UH...

07:02.375 --> 07:05.125
YOU'D HAVE TO ASK
MY BOYFRIEND JACK.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.458
YOU RANG?

07:06.458 --> 07:08.708
UH, YEAH. I THOUGHT
I'D INTRODUCE YOU TO THIS GUY

07:08.708 --> 07:10.417
WHO JUST HAD THE GOOD TASTE
TO HIT ON ME.

07:10.417 --> 07:11.750
UH, JACK, THIS IS...

07:11.750 --> 07:12.708
UH, FRED.
FRED.

07:12.708 --> 07:13.917
HI.

07:13.917 --> 07:15.542
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

07:15.542 --> 07:16.583
NOT A PROBLEM.
IT'S COOL.

07:16.583 --> 07:20.542
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT COOL,
OF COURSE.

07:20.542 --> 07:22.583
ALTHOUGH I DO LIKE
TO PIMP HIM OUT
FROM TIME TO TIME.

07:22.583 --> 07:24.542
(LAUGHS) GOTCHA.

07:27.166 --> 07:28.250
IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.542
YOU, TOO.

07:33.792 --> 07:34.583
HI.

07:36.708 --> 07:37.917
HE SEEMED NICE.

07:37.917 --> 07:39.667
YEAH.

07:42.834 --> 07:44.667
WHY AM I DOING THIS?

07:44.667 --> 07:45.667
EATING CHEESE?

07:45.667 --> 07:46.708
NO, NO, THIS.

07:46.708 --> 07:48.708
I'M NOT--I'M NOT
CUT OUT FOR THIS.

07:48.708 --> 07:49.792
WHAT IF NOBODY TALKS?

07:49.792 --> 07:52.667
I MEAN, AT LEAST
AT THE HELPLINE
I CAN HANG UP ON THEM.

07:52.667 --> 07:54.250
BUT WHAT IF NOBODY
ASKS ANY QUESTIONS?

07:54.250 --> 07:55.583
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

07:55.583 --> 07:57.208
RUN AND HIDE AND CURL UP
IN A FETAL POSITION

07:57.208 --> 07:59.250
HOPING NOBODY FINDS YOU?

07:59.250 --> 07:59.959
I NEED A RINGER.

07:59.959 --> 08:01.083
A WHAT?

08:01.083 --> 08:03.625
A RINGER--

08:03.625 --> 08:05.291
SOMEBODY TO ASK
PRE-PLANNED QUESTIONS

08:05.291 --> 08:06.834
DURING UNCOMFORTABLE
MOMENTS OF SILENCE.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.291
WELL, DON'T LOOK AT ME.

08:08.291 --> 08:10.750
I SUFFER FROM
GLOSSOPHOBIA.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.417
IT'S A FEAR
OF PUBLIC SPEAKING.

08:13.417 --> 08:15.375
SO MY DUTIES TONIGHT

08:15.375 --> 08:16.208
WILL BE STRICTLY LIMITED
TO TICKET TAKING,

08:16.208 --> 08:18.792
WHICH I WILL NOW GO DO.

08:18.792 --> 08:19.625
GOOD LUCK.
THANKS.

08:24.417 --> 08:26.834
HI.
HI.

08:26.834 --> 08:27.834
SO...

08:27.834 --> 08:29.834
SO...

08:32.166 --> 08:35.250
(SIGHS)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:36.500 --> 08:38.667
I'M HELPING YOU HOST
THE EVENT, REMEMBER?

08:38.667 --> 08:41.457
YEAH.

08:41.457 --> 08:43.750
RIGHT.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.875
UM, ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED EARLIER--

08:45.875 --> 08:48.417
YOU KNOW WHAT? I CAN'T REALLY
TALK ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

08:48.417 --> 08:50.667
I'M SORRY. I...

08:50.667 --> 08:52.000
I'VE GOT SO MANY
NOTES TO GO OVER,

08:52.000 --> 08:53.667
AND...COLD CUTS,

08:53.667 --> 08:55.333
I HAVE THESE REALLY
WONDERFUL COLD CUTS

08:55.333 --> 08:57.250
THAT I DON'T WANT
TO GO TO WASTE.

08:58.875 --> 09:01.000
OK. FAIR ENOUGH. YEAH.
I'LL JUST GO GET READY.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.500
GOOD.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.500
OH, MY GOD!
WHERE IS HE?

09:05.500 --> 09:06.375
WHO?

09:06.375 --> 09:09.041
WHO? WHO? OH, JEN, JEN.
SWEET, SWEET, JEN.

09:09.041 --> 09:12.333
SUCH AN AMUSING FACADE,
BUT IT'S OF NO USE.
YOU CAN'T KEEP US APART.

09:12.333 --> 09:13.333
IT'S DESTINY,
I TELL YOU. DESTINY.

09:13.333 --> 09:16.583
JEN, HE WAS
ON MY PLANE.

09:16.583 --> 09:19.542
LADIES, PUT
THE CLAWS BACK.
NO NEED TO FIGHT.

09:19.542 --> 09:23.375
PLENTY OF ROOM ON
THE CAROLLA COASTER
FOR EVERYONE.

09:23.375 --> 09:25.208
I'M AFRAID I WON'T MEET
THE MINIMUM-HEIGHT REQUIREMENT.

09:25.208 --> 09:26.959
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:26.959 --> 09:27.750
I GOT TO GO.

09:29.792 --> 09:31.500
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

09:31.500 --> 09:32.708
YOU WANT
TO HOP ON BOARD?

09:32.708 --> 09:34.875
I WASN'T TALKING
ABOUT YOU, DOOFUS.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.542
I'M KIND OF LOOKING
FOR DR. DREW.

09:36.542 --> 09:37.500
PINSKY?

09:37.500 --> 09:39.583
YES, YES!
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?

09:39.583 --> 09:41.875
THAT GEEZER'S PROBABLY
OUT CASKET SHOPPING.

09:41.875 --> 09:43.625
HE'S OLD.
HE'S AN OLD MAN.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.875
HE'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE
YOUR GRANDFATHER.

09:45.875 --> 09:48.750
WHEREAS I,
I'M JUST OLD ENOUGH
TO BE YOUR DADDY.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.917
AND PLUS,
THE GUY'S A BORE.
HE'S AN AMAZING BORE.

09:50.917 --> 09:55.708
HE NEVER STOPS TALKING
ABOUT GONORRHEA
AND HEPATITIS G.

09:55.708 --> 09:56.625
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

09:56.625 --> 09:58.750
I HAVE TO SHARE A HOTEL
ROOM WITH THE GUY.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.834
CHEAP BASTARDS.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.750
OH, MY GOD.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.208
YOU'VE SHARED
A ROOM WITH HIM?

10:04.208 --> 10:06.583
TELL ME SOMETHING.

10:07.542 --> 10:09.959
(WHISPERING)
Have you seen him naked?

10:09.959 --> 10:13.458
Yes. Yes, I have.

10:40.667 --> 10:41.917
I HATE TO TELL YOU THIS,

10:41.917 --> 10:42.875
BUT IN ABOUT 2 MINUTES,

10:42.875 --> 10:43.333
THERE'S GOING TO BE A RIOT
FOR THAT SEAT.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.417
(LAUGHS) HEY.
HEY.

10:45.417 --> 10:47.750
JACK, RIGHT?
YEAH. YEAH.

10:47.750 --> 10:49.667
FRED.
SO...WHERE'S THE BOYFRIEND?

10:49.667 --> 10:53.000
WELL, THAT WOULD BE
THE QUESTION OF
THE HOUR.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.250
CLEARLY NOT WHERE
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.417
BUT IT IS TAKEN, RIGHT?

10:58.792 --> 11:00.375
THE SEAT?

11:01.792 --> 11:06.000
UH...YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I WAS, UM...

11:06.000 --> 11:08.250
WHAT THE HELL.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.750
IT'S ALL YOURS.

11:27.583 --> 11:30.000
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
IT'S OVER.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.375
WHAT IS?
THE TRUST.

11:31.375 --> 11:32.250
ARE WE STILL TALKING--

11:32.250 --> 11:34.792
DONE. GONE. FINITO.
DEADER THAN DISCO.

11:34.792 --> 11:37.959
YOU ALLOWED ME TO THINK
THAT I WAS GOOD AT IT.

11:37.959 --> 11:38.875
GOOD AT WHAT?

11:38.875 --> 11:40.375
THE SWEET,
TENDER LOVEMAKING

11:40.375 --> 11:42.333
THAT COUPLES TEND
TO ENGAGE IN UPON DAY'S END.

11:42.333 --> 11:43.959
LOOK, YOU ARE
GOOD AT IT, OK?

11:43.959 --> 11:45.959
NOW COULD WE PLEASE
STOP TALKING ABOUT THIS?

11:45.959 --> 11:47.667
NO. NO, WE CAN'T.

11:47.667 --> 11:49.166
AND I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT
OF THIS EVENING

11:49.166 --> 11:50.834
WAS FOR PEOPLE TO GET TOGETHER
AND TALK ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS.

11:50.834 --> 11:53.208
WE'RE FREAKS,
BUT WE'RE NOT THOSE
KINDS OF FREAKS.

11:53.208 --> 11:53.667
SIT!

11:53.667 --> 11:55.375
LYING ON THE GROUND,

11:55.375 --> 11:56.542
HIS TONGUE IS JUST
HANGING OUT OF HIS MOUTH,

11:56.542 --> 11:57.375
VULTURES FLYING
OVER HIS HEAD.

11:57.375 --> 11:59.208
AND HE GOES TO THE FARMER,
HE GOES, "SHH.

11:59.208 --> 12:00.708
THEY'RE JUST ABOUT
TO LAND."

12:00.708 --> 12:03.250
(LAUGHS) OH, MAN.
YOU'RE DEFINITELY GOING
TO GET PUNCHED FOR THAT.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.291
I COULD THINK
OF WORSE THINGS.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.208
LIKE NOT SAVING
YOUR BOYFRIEND A SEAT?

12:08.166 --> 12:10.208
DAVID, HEY.
YOU REMEMBER, UM...

12:10.208 --> 12:12.083
I REMEMBER.
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.875
I THOUGHT WE SAID
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE STAGE.

12:13.875 --> 12:16.708
WE DID.

12:16.708 --> 12:18.291
WE, UH...

12:18.291 --> 12:19.875
SEE, I MEANT
FROM THE FRONT.

12:19.875 --> 12:21.208
(APPLAUSE)

12:21.208 --> 12:22.375
FROM THE FRONT,
IT'S THE RIGHT,

12:22.375 --> 12:23.500
BUT IF YOU'RE COMING
FROM THE BACK,

12:23.500 --> 12:24.625
I COULD SEE HOW
YOU COULD HAVE...

12:29.875 --> 12:30.875
UH...

12:30.875 --> 12:32.166
YOU KNOW...

12:32.166 --> 12:33.083
I'M--I'M SORRY.

12:33.083 --> 12:34.250
IT'S MY FAULT.
I'LL MOVE.

12:34.250 --> 12:35.458
GOOD IDEA.

12:37.750 --> 12:42.166
THEY ARE BOTH THE HOSTS
OF THE WILDLY POPULAR
RADIO SHOW LOVELINE.

12:42.166 --> 12:42.875
I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD
AND TAKE THIS TIME

12:42.875 --> 12:44.959
TO INTRODUCE OUR
ESTEEMED GUESTS

12:44.959 --> 12:46.333
DR. DREW
AND ADAM COROLLA.

12:46.333 --> 12:50.291
(APPLAUSE)

12:52.750 --> 12:56.000
UM, OK. WELL, SINCE
OUR TIME HERE IS LIMITED,

12:56.000 --> 12:57.500
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS
HOW THIS WORKS.

12:57.500 --> 13:01.083
WITH NO FURTHER ADO...

13:01.083 --> 13:02.041
WHO HAS THE FIRST QUESTION?

13:16.458 --> 13:19.917
OK, NOT EVERYONE AT ONCE.

13:40.625 --> 13:42.208
OH, JEN.

13:42.208 --> 13:43.792
JEN, PICK ME.

13:43.792 --> 13:44.291
LINDLEY!

13:44.291 --> 13:46.625
UH, ANYBODY.

13:46.625 --> 13:49.792
ANYBODY.

13:49.792 --> 13:52.667
BUELLER?

13:52.667 --> 13:54.625
BUELLER?

13:54.625 --> 13:57.500
COME ON. YOU PEOPLE
ARE IN COLLEGE.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.083
YOUR CRABS HAVE GONORRHEA.

13:59.083 --> 13:59.792
WHERE'S THE QUESTIONS?

13:59.792 --> 14:01.667
I'D ACTUALLY--
I'D ACTUALLY LIKE

14:01.667 --> 14:05.166
TO POSE A QUESTION,
IF I MAY?

14:05.166 --> 14:06.875
ACTUALLY, C.J.,

14:06.875 --> 14:09.375
I THINK IT'S YOUR JOB
TO FIELD THE QUESTIONS,
NOT ASK THEM.

14:09.375 --> 14:10.333
YOU FIELD, THEY ASK.

14:10.333 --> 14:13.083
FIELD. ASK. FIELD. ASK.
YOU SEE HOW IT WORKS?

14:13.083 --> 14:15.166
THAT'S OK, JENNIFER.
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY
WORRIED ABOUT FORM HERE.

14:15.166 --> 14:16.875
SO GO ON, C.J.,
ASK YOUR QUESTION.

14:16.875 --> 14:20.041
UH, OK. WELL,
THERE'S THIS, UH...

14:20.041 --> 14:23.708
GIRL THAT I HAVE--
OR HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH.

14:23.708 --> 14:24.500
SHE WAS A SEX BUDDY?

14:24.500 --> 14:26.333
NO, SHE, UH...

14:26.333 --> 14:29.708
SHE WAS A GIRLFRIEND,
ACTUALLY, AND WE WERE
TOGETHER FOR SEVERAL MONTHS

14:29.708 --> 14:30.667
UP UNTIL THIS MORNING,

14:30.667 --> 14:32.917
WHEN SHE DUMPED ME LIKE
A SACK OF ROTTEN TRASH.

14:32.917 --> 14:35.667
NO EXPLANATION,
NO WARNING, NO NOTHING.

14:35.667 --> 14:36.875
WERE THERE ANY
WARNING SIGNS?

14:36.875 --> 14:38.750
ANY PROBLEMS IN
THE RELATIONSHIP?

14:39.708 --> 14:40.834
NO, NONE.

14:40.834 --> 14:41.875
WELL...

14:41.875 --> 14:43.542
I DID SLEEP WITH
ONE OF HER FRIENDS.

14:43.542 --> 14:47.583
BUT JUST ONE, RIGHT?

14:47.583 --> 14:49.667
WOMEN DON'T--THEY DON'T MIND
THAT KIND OF STUFF.

14:49.667 --> 14:50.834
CAN'T BE THAT.

14:50.834 --> 14:51.792
BUT SHE KNEW ABOUT IT

14:51.792 --> 14:53.750
AND IT WAS BEFORE
WE GOT TOGETHER,

14:53.750 --> 14:55.208
SO THAT DOESN'T
REALLY COUNT, RIGHT?

14:55.208 --> 14:58.083
HAVE YOU SIMPLY
TRIED ASKING FOR
AN EXPLANATION?

14:58.083 --> 14:59.041
THAT'S THE THING.

14:59.041 --> 15:00.667
EVERY TIME I TRY
TO TALK TO HER,

15:00.667 --> 15:02.750
SHE TREATS ME LIKE
I'M FATHER DAMIEN.

15:04.708 --> 15:07.083
HE WAS A LEPER.

15:07.083 --> 15:08.208
OH, SURE.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.375
THE FAMOUS LEPER,
FATHER DAMIEN.

15:10.375 --> 15:13.458
DREW, YOU WROTE YOUR THESIS
ON FATHER DAMIEN, DID YOU NOT?

15:13.458 --> 15:14.417
ALL RIGHT. LISTEN,

15:14.417 --> 15:16.792
I SAY RUN.

15:16.792 --> 15:19.000
I MEAN, THIS CHICK'S
A HEAD CASE.

15:19.000 --> 15:19.875
SHE'S GOING TO TAKE
YOU DOWN, I PROMISE.

15:19.875 --> 15:22.417
THANK YOU, ADAM,
FOR THAT ASTUTE INSIGHT,

15:22.417 --> 15:24.250
BUT IF YOU DON'T
MIND ME SAYING SO,

15:24.250 --> 15:27.041
I THINK THAT C.J.'s PROBLEMS
HERE ARE REALLY SUBORDINATE

15:27.041 --> 15:28.875
TO THOSE OF THE MANY
MEMBERS OF THIS AUDIENCE

15:28.875 --> 15:30.417
WHO HAVE ACTUALLY PAID
GOOD MONEY TO LISTEN

15:30.417 --> 15:31.583
TO YOUR VASTLY
UNDERQUALIFIED ADVICE.

15:31.583 --> 15:36.375
YOU'RE SO LUCKY I DON'T KNOW
WHAT "SUBORDINATE" MEANS, HONEY.

15:36.375 --> 15:37.583
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

15:37.583 --> 15:40.125
SO I GUESS WE SHOULD PROBABLY
JUST BREAK UP THEN, HUH?

15:40.125 --> 15:42.667
(WHISPERING)
Would you be quiet?

15:42.667 --> 15:43.750
WELL, I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE!

15:43.750 --> 15:46.166
Shut up.

15:46.166 --> 15:48.125
(WHISPERING)
Don't tell me to shut up
in front of all these people.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.417
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS

15:52.417 --> 15:53.708
WHY IS SO HARD FOR YOU
TO TALK ABOUT SEX?!

15:53.708 --> 15:57.250
Adam: WHOA.
WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

15:57.250 --> 15:59.667
WE GOT TO HEAR
MORE ABOUT THIS.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.500
WE GOT A WIENER
IN THE CROWD HERE, DREW.

16:01.500 --> 16:02.542
LET'S GET A MIKE
OVER TO THESE GUYS.

16:02.542 --> 16:04.625
THIS WILL MAKE
A GOOD QUESTION.

16:04.625 --> 16:05.625
UH, NO,
THAT'S OK.

16:05.625 --> 16:06.291
THERE'S
NO PROBLEM.

16:06.291 --> 16:08.750
NOPE. NOPE.
NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.000
OH, YEAH.
YEAH, THERE'S A PROBLEM,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.708
OR YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
SCREAMING LIKE A GIRL
10 SECONDS AGO.

16:13.708 --> 16:14.792
WE NEED TO HEAR THIS PROBLEM.
WHAT IS IT?

16:14.792 --> 16:17.792
NO, IT'S REALLY--
IT'S OK.

16:17.792 --> 16:18.750
IT'S NOT--IT'S NOT
THAT BAD, ACTUALLY.

16:18.750 --> 16:19.750
YEAH, HE LIKES
IT THAT WAY.

16:19.750 --> 16:22.041
HE PREFERS IT,
ACTUALLY.

16:22.041 --> 16:22.625
I'M SORRY. I THINK
I MISSED SOMETHING.

16:22.625 --> 16:24.625
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

16:26.375 --> 16:27.500
JOEY.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.125
I'M EDDIE.
BUT LIKE I SAID,

16:29.125 --> 16:30.625
WE HAVE
NO PROBLEM.

16:30.625 --> 16:31.375
OH, IF YOU SAY SO.

16:31.375 --> 16:34.458
BUT YOU CAN'T HELP
BUT WONDER, ADAM,

16:34.458 --> 16:36.875
SHOULD A COUPLE THAT'S
NOT EVEN MATURE ENOUGH
TO TALK ABOUT SEX

16:36.875 --> 16:38.125
BE HAVING SEX?
YEAH.

16:38.125 --> 16:40.208
GIVE ME THIS. THAT'S WHAT
I'M SAYING, DR. DREW.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.583
IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M SAYING.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.041
WELL, NOT EXACTLY
WHAT I'M SAYING.

16:43.041 --> 16:44.834
I MEAN, SHE IS A LITTLE,
LIKE, UPTIGHT ABOUT
THE WHOLE THING.

16:44.834 --> 16:46.291
I AM NOT.
YES, YOU ARE.

16:46.291 --> 16:47.417
LISTEN, LISTEN.

16:47.417 --> 16:51.083
THIS LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP
IS BREAKING MY HEART.

16:51.083 --> 16:51.834
LET'S GET YOU TWO
UP ON STAGE

16:51.834 --> 16:54.583
WHERE WE CAN THUMP YOU
LIKE MELONS.

16:54.583 --> 16:57.250
WHAT DO YOU GUYS SAY?
(APPLAUSE)

16:58.583 --> 17:01.333
(MOUTHING WORDS)

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
THANK YOU.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.165
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

17:36.166 --> 17:37.500
JEN!

17:37.500 --> 17:40.417
JEN! I REALLY HAVE ONE.

17:40.417 --> 17:41.583
JEN!

17:52.708 --> 17:54.708
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

17:54.708 --> 17:56.208
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU
AFTERWARDS.

17:56.208 --> 17:56.917
OK.

17:56.917 --> 17:58.875
NOW WHY DON'T
YOU TWO START

17:58.875 --> 18:00.375
BY TELLING US ABOUT
THIS RELATIONSHIP?

18:01.708 --> 18:05.708
WELL...I'LL START.

18:05.708 --> 18:07.333
IT'S ALL VERY SIMPLE,
ACTUALLY.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.125
TODAY, I REALIZED
THAT THE GIRL

18:09.125 --> 18:11.000
THAT I HAVE BEEN
OPENING MY LIFE

18:11.000 --> 18:13.333
AND BARING MY--
MY NAKED SOUL TO

18:13.333 --> 18:15.458
FOR THE PAST 6 MONTHS
IS A PHONY.

18:15.458 --> 18:16.458
6 MONTHS.
IS THAT HOW LONG

18:16.458 --> 18:17.458
THIS THING'S BEEN
GOING ON?

18:17.458 --> 18:19.917
WELL, IT'S HARD
TO TELL EXACTLY.

18:19.917 --> 18:22.750
I MEAN,
WE MET IN THE FALL,

18:22.750 --> 18:24.041
BUT WE REALLY DIDN'T
LIKE EACH OTHER--

18:24.041 --> 18:25.583
OH, HEY, STOP.

18:25.583 --> 18:27.083
OK, LOOK, I HAD
NO BEEF WITH HER,

18:27.083 --> 18:29.542
BUT SHE--SHE
OBVIOUSLY...

18:29.542 --> 18:31.041
YOU KNOW,
WAS IN LOVE WITH ME...

18:31.041 --> 18:33.708
IN HER OWN EMOTIONALLY
UNSTABLE WAY.

18:33.708 --> 18:35.417
EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE?

18:35.417 --> 18:36.417
I'M EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE?

18:36.417 --> 18:37.583
YES, LOOK IN
THE MIRROR, JOEY.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.959
WHO PACKED UP AND LEFT
WITH NO FORWARDING ADDRESS

18:39.959 --> 18:41.917
AT THE FIRST SIGN THAT
THIS THING WAS GETTING SERIOUS?

18:41.917 --> 18:43.250
OH, I CAME BACK,
DIDN'T I?

18:43.250 --> 18:44.083
NO, NOT WILLINGLY.
I'M SITTING HERE.

18:44.083 --> 18:47.208
I HAD TO COME
LOOKING FOR YOU, DIDN'T I?

18:47.208 --> 18:51.083
AT A SIGNIFICANT LOSS
TO MY PERSONAL DIGNITY,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

18:51.083 --> 18:52.875
AND THEN, TO CELEBRATE...

18:52.875 --> 18:53.792
HE LEFT AGAIN.

18:53.792 --> 18:54.834
AND THROUGHOUT
ALL THIS,

18:54.834 --> 18:56.125
YOU KEPT HAVING SEX?

18:56.125 --> 18:57.125
OH, YEAH.

18:57.125 --> 18:58.000
Adam: NO WONDER
SHE'S SCREWED UP.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.250
THANK YOU.
WAIT A SECOND--

19:00.250 --> 19:03.917
LISTEN, I DON'T LIKE
THE CUT OF YOUR JIB, SON.

19:03.917 --> 19:05.959
I MEAN, YOU HAVE
SEX WITH HER,

19:05.959 --> 19:07.291
THEN YOU DUMP HER.

19:07.291 --> 19:10.500
THEN YOU TRY TO GET
HER TRUST BACK,

19:10.500 --> 19:12.750
EXCEPT FOR YOU
ABANDON HER AGAIN.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.333
SO YOU'VE
ABANDONED HER TWICE,

19:14.333 --> 19:19.375
AND NOW YOU'RE
PERPLEXED AS TO WHY
SHE WON'T TRUST YOU

19:19.375 --> 19:22.291
WHEN YOU'VE
DUMPED HER 2 TIMES?

19:22.291 --> 19:23.792
ARE YOU HIGH, SON?

19:23.792 --> 19:26.333
I MEAN, NO WONDER
SHE'S CUT YOU OFF.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.792
DREW, IF YOU TREATED ME
THIS WAY,

19:27.792 --> 19:29.625
I'D CUT YOU OFF...
IN A HEARTBEAT.

19:29.625 --> 19:31.500
THAT'S WHY I TREAT YOU
THE RIGHT WAY.
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.500
JOEY, IS THIS
ABANDONMENT A BIG
ISSUE FOR YOU?

19:37.208 --> 19:37.959
NO.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.834
ARE YOU ON
ANY MEDICATION?

19:39.834 --> 19:40.792
NO!

19:40.792 --> 19:42.291
IS YOU DAD AROUND?

19:42.291 --> 19:43.792
IS HE A BIG FIGURE
IN YOUR LIFE?

19:43.792 --> 19:45.542
IS ANYTHING
GOING ON WITH HIM?

19:47.583 --> 19:49.542
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DR. DREW,

19:49.542 --> 19:51.583
I THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING,

19:51.583 --> 19:53.125
BUT I--I THINK
I'VE HAD ENOUGH,

19:53.125 --> 19:53.875
AND I'M GOING TO HEAD
BACK TO MY SEAT NOW.

19:53.875 --> 19:56.000
NOT SO FAST.
LISTEN, JOEY,

19:56.000 --> 19:57.166
NOTHING TO BE
ASHAMED OF.

19:57.166 --> 19:59.500
COMMON PROBLEMS,
ALL RIGHT?

19:59.500 --> 20:01.291
TOUGH TO TALK ABOUT.

20:01.291 --> 20:02.041
JENNIFER, I'M SURE
PEOPLE CALL THE HELPLINE

20:02.041 --> 20:04.166
ALL THE TIME WITH
THINGS LIKE THIS.

20:04.166 --> 20:06.333
OH, YEAH.
CONSTANTLY.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.166
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING
TO BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT.

20:08.166 --> 20:12.041
YOU'RE VERY NORMAL
IN YOUR ABNORMALITY.

20:13.458 --> 20:16.041
JEN, PERHAPS THERE'S
SOMEONE ELSE IN
THE AUDIENCE

20:16.041 --> 20:18.834
THAT WOULD LIKE
TO ASK A QUESTION.

20:21.333 --> 20:23.208
OH, YES, YES,
WITH THE RAISED HAND.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.500
WHO IS THAT?

20:24.500 --> 20:25.959
UH...

20:25.959 --> 20:27.333
MY NAME'S DAVID,
AND I NEED TO KNOW

20:27.333 --> 20:28.458
WHAT THE PROPER
RESPONSE MIGHT BE

20:28.458 --> 20:30.166
WHEN YOU FIND YOUR
BOYFRIEND OPENLY
FLIRTING

20:30.166 --> 20:31.500
WITH SOME OTHER GUY
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU?

20:31.500 --> 20:32.834
I WASN'T FLIRTING.

20:32.834 --> 20:37.458
SINCE WHEN IS HAVING
AN IDLE CHAT CONSIDERED
FLIRTING, MY FRIEND?

20:37.458 --> 20:40.000
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF DATES,
HE THINKS HE OWNS ME, DREW.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.583
ADAM WANTS TO BE
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

20:42.583 --> 20:44.208
HE LONGS TO BE GAY.

20:44.208 --> 20:46.041
DAVID, UH,
WAS THIS A MONOGAMOUS
RELATIONSHIP?

20:46.041 --> 20:48.041
YEAH. I THOUGHT IT WAS.

20:48.041 --> 20:50.208
I SEE. SO YOU'RE
KIND OF WONDERING

20:50.208 --> 20:51.750
WHETHER IT ACTUALLY
IS MONOGAMOUS.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.291
WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
YOU GUYS NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THIS.

20:54.291 --> 20:56.333
UM, YOU KNOW,
ONE POSSIBILITY IS

20:56.333 --> 20:57.959
THAT HE'S ACTING OUT
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU,

20:57.959 --> 20:59.458
BECAUSE HE'S TRYING
TO GIVE YOU A MESSAGE,

20:59.458 --> 21:01.959
AND HE JUST DOESN'T
HAVE ANY OTHER WAY
TO TELL YOU.

21:04.458 --> 21:05.291
OR MAYBE HE'S JUST
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

21:05.291 --> 21:07.125
WHO'S REALLY SUPER-NICE
TO EVERYBODY

21:07.125 --> 21:09.083
SO IT SEEMS LIKE
HE'S FLIRTING,

21:09.083 --> 21:10.166
BUT ACTUALLY, HE'S NOT,

21:10.166 --> 21:11.625
'CAUSE NOBODY'S THAT STUPID.

21:11.625 --> 21:15.083
SO, MY ADVICE ON THIS WOULD
JUST BE FORGIVE AND FORGET.

21:15.083 --> 21:17.625
Adam: ARE YOU HIGH, MISSY?

21:17.625 --> 21:18.750
YOU GOT TO DUMP THIS GUY,

21:18.750 --> 21:20.917
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT
BECAUSE HE'S A GAY.

21:20.917 --> 21:23.083
UM...OK,

21:23.083 --> 21:24.834
WHY DON'T WE GO
TO MANDY BEHIND THE SCREEN?

21:25.458 --> 21:26.583
MANDY,
WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION?

21:26.583 --> 21:28.583
MANDY?

21:28.583 --> 21:30.458
OH. HI. SORRY, NO.

21:30.458 --> 21:32.333
ACTUALLY,
MY NAME IS AUDREY,

21:32.333 --> 21:36.083
AND MY QUESTION
IS SPECIFICALLY
FOR DR. DREW.

21:36.083 --> 21:39.417
UM, I'M ABOUT
5'7".

21:39.417 --> 21:42.458
I'VE GOT BLOND HAIR,
BLUE EYES, GREAT RACK.

21:42.458 --> 21:44.125
AUDREY, QUESTION.
FIND IT.

21:44.125 --> 21:48.291
OH, RIGHT.
OK. WELL, UM...

21:48.291 --> 21:49.917
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO,

21:49.917 --> 21:52.417
I REALIZED THAT I HAD
A SERIOUS PROBLEM
WITH ALCOHOL.

21:52.417 --> 21:55.458
I HAD ALL THESE
NEGATIVE FEELINGS
ABOUT MY LIFE,

21:55.458 --> 21:59.792
AND I WAS USING ALCOHOL
AS MY ESCAPE.

21:59.792 --> 22:01.125
AND IN THE PROCESS,

22:01.125 --> 22:03.917
I HURT A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT WERE VERY
CLOSE TO ME.

22:03.917 --> 22:07.166
AND IF IT HADN'T
BEEN FOR THOSE VERY
SAME PEOPLE,

22:07.166 --> 22:08.667
I PROBABLY WOULD NOT
HAVE GOTTEN

22:08.667 --> 22:11.125
THE PROFESSIONAL HELP
THAT I NEEDED.

22:11.125 --> 22:12.458
SO AFTER SPENDING
SEVERAL WEEKS

22:12.458 --> 22:16.083
IN A REHAB FACILITY
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,

22:16.083 --> 22:18.333
UM...

22:18.333 --> 22:21.333
I GUESS MY QUESTION
TO YOU IS THIS,
DR. DREW--

22:22.500 --> 22:23.291
HOW WOULD
YOU LIKE TO GO BACK
TO MY DORM ROOM

22:23.291 --> 22:26.000
AND PLAY A LITTLE GAME
I LIKE TO CALL

22:26.000 --> 22:27.917
"DIRTY DOCTOR
AND NAUGHTY NURSE?"

22:27.917 --> 22:30.583
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

22:31.750 --> 22:33.792
OK...

22:33.792 --> 22:35.000
AUDREY, THAT WAS TOUCHING.

22:36.166 --> 22:39.834
LET'S MOVE ON,
SHALL WE, TO-

22:39.834 --> 22:41.291
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY
HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE

22:41.291 --> 22:43.125
TO GET A WOMAN'S
PERSPECTIVE ON
SOME OF THESE MATTERS.

22:43.125 --> 22:45.166
UH, TELL ME, JENNIFER,

22:45.166 --> 22:47.959
GETTING BACK
TO MY PROBLEM,

22:47.959 --> 22:49.000
WHY DO YOU THINK
THIS GIRL DECIDED

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
TO RIP MY HEART OUT
WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION?

22:53.166 --> 22:55.708
WELL, IF YOU ASK ME, C.J.,

22:55.708 --> 22:58.500
I THINK THE TIME
FOR YOUR PROBLEM
HAS COME AND GONE.

22:58.500 --> 23:01.750
NOW, SINCE WE HAVE WITH US HERE
THE EXPERTS ONSTAGE

23:01.750 --> 23:03.750
WHO ARE HERE TO ANSWER
PEOPLE'S QUESTIONS--

23:03.750 --> 23:05.917
OH, EXPERTS, HUH?

23:05.917 --> 23:07.792
A MINUTE AGO, I WAS HACK,
NOW I'M BACK TO EXPERT?

23:07.792 --> 23:09.708
THAT'S NICE.

23:09.708 --> 23:11.750
ACTUALLY, JENNIFER,
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

23:11.750 --> 23:13.458
YOU SHOULD ANSWER
THIS QUESTION.

23:13.458 --> 23:15.792
EVERYONE'S HERE
TO SUPPORT THE HELPLINE.

23:15.792 --> 23:17.041
WHY DON'T
YOU GIVE THEM A SAMPLE

23:17.041 --> 23:17.542
OF WHAT THEY CAN GET
WHEN THEY CALL IN?

23:22.333 --> 23:23.959
OK. WELL, IF YOU ASK ME,

23:23.959 --> 23:26.250
UM...

23:26.250 --> 23:29.291
I THINK THAT THE ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION HAS MANY PARTS.

23:29.291 --> 23:34.542
ONE, IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT THIS GIRL

23:34.542 --> 23:35.458
ISN'T REALLY OUT TO GET YOU,

23:35.458 --> 23:39.041
THAT MAYBE, IN FACT,
SHE'S JUST CONFUSED.

23:39.041 --> 23:40.500
TO SAY THE LEAST.

23:40.500 --> 23:44.041
AND 2, MAYBE SHE HAS A LOT
ON HER PLATE AT THE MOMENT,

23:44.041 --> 23:48.083
SO SHE DOESN'T
FEEL LIKE SHE HAS
THE TIME FOR A RELATIONSHIP.

23:49.625 --> 23:50.917
AND 3?

23:50.917 --> 23:51.708
THAT'S IT.

23:51.708 --> 23:55.875
YOU CAN'T JUST START
STRINGING TOGETHER

23:55.875 --> 24:00.000
A LIST OF REASONS
AND STOP AT 2.

24:00.000 --> 24:00.750
SAYS WHO?

24:00.750 --> 24:04.917
SAYS WHO?
SAYS--SAYS ME. SAYS DREW.

24:04.917 --> 24:06.625
SAYS OUR PARENTS.

24:06.625 --> 24:07.083
REMEMBER YOUR MOM
SAID THAT TO ME, DREW?

24:07.083 --> 24:10.083
OK, FINE. YOU GET 3.

24:10.083 --> 24:13.333
LISTEN, I JUST DON'T
WANT A BOYFRIEND AT
THIS POINT IN TIME, OK?

24:13.333 --> 24:14.583
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

24:14.583 --> 24:15.458
"I DON'T?"

24:15.458 --> 24:17.125
THIS IS THE HEAD CASE
HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

24:17.125 --> 24:19.041
HE'S TALKING ABOUT HER.

24:19.041 --> 24:19.708
NO.

24:21.708 --> 24:22.625
YES.

24:22.625 --> 24:24.417
I AM THE GIRL THAT
HE IS REFERRING TO,

24:24.417 --> 24:26.625
BUT NO, I'M NOT
A HEAD CASE.

24:26.625 --> 24:27.959
OH, WOW.
THIS IS INTERESTING.

24:27.959 --> 24:29.959
SO, WHY DID YOU
DUMP THIS GUY?

24:29.959 --> 24:32.542
UNLESS YOU DON'T FEEL
COMFORTABLE TALKING
ABOUT THESE ISSUES.

24:32.542 --> 24:36.000
NO, IT'S JUST, UM...

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
Adam: HE BEATS YOU, RIGHT?
I KNEW IT.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.166
I COULD SEE IT
IN HIS EYES, DREW.

24:40.166 --> 24:43.291
SERIOUSLY,
IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT
THIS GUY YOU DON'T LIKE?

24:43.291 --> 24:44.834
OR IS IT SOMETHING
ABOUT HIM,

24:44.834 --> 24:45.291
OR SOMETHING ABOUT
THE RELATIONSHIP?

24:45.291 --> 24:48.875
NO, NO, I LIKE HIM.

24:48.875 --> 24:51.291
I LIKE HIM. WHAT'S--
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE?

24:51.291 --> 24:52.000
HE'S PERFECT.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.667
HE'S THE PERFECT
LIVING EMBODIMENT

24:54.667 --> 24:57.250
OF EVERYTHING THAT
I'VE EVER WANTED IN A BOYFRIEND,

24:57.250 --> 24:59.291
BUT NEVER THOUGHT
THAT I WOULD ACTUALLY FIND.

24:59.291 --> 25:02.625
YOU'RE KIND, YOU'RE CARING,
YOU'RE SENSITIVE,

25:02.625 --> 25:04.542
YOU'RE NOT WIGGED OUT
BY GAY PEOPLE.

25:04.542 --> 25:06.500
HE IS KIND OF CUTE.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.625
HE'S GOT A BIT OF
THE SPADER WORKING FOR HIM.

25:08.625 --> 25:11.208
IF I WERE TO START
A BOY FROM SCRATCH,

25:11.208 --> 25:13.750
THIS IS WHAT HE WOULD
END UP AS.

25:17.166 --> 25:17.834
ALL RIGHT THEN.

25:17.834 --> 25:20.834
SO, WHY WOULD
YOU SABOTAGE THIS?

25:20.834 --> 25:22.417
WHY WOULD YOU TAKE
SOMEONE GOOD,

25:22.417 --> 25:25.583
SOMEONE YOU DESCRIBED
AS WONDERFUL, PERFECT,

25:25.583 --> 25:26.834
AND JUST DRIVE HIM AWAY?

25:38.750 --> 25:39.417
CAN WE TURN THIS BACK
TO JOEY?

25:39.417 --> 25:41.250
SHE'S MORE
SCREWED UP THAN ME.

25:41.250 --> 25:42.166
HEY.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.708
WERE EITHER OF YOU
ABUSED WHEN YOU
WERE KIDS?

25:44.708 --> 25:46.125
NO.
NO.

25:46.125 --> 25:48.875
JOEY'S DAD DID SOME
TIME IN THE BIG HOUSE.

25:48.875 --> 25:50.834
MAYBE WE COULD BRING
JACK UP HERE FOR
SOME HUMILIATION.

25:50.834 --> 25:54.041
NO, NO, NO.
DO NOT LET HER CHANGE
THE SUBJECT AGAIN, JEN.

25:54.041 --> 25:55.250
I STILL INTEND TO GET
SOME ANSWERS FROM
SALLY ALBRIGHT--

25:55.250 --> 25:57.208
HEY, GET
IN LINE, PAL.

25:57.208 --> 25:58.542
AT LEAST YOU STILL
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

25:58.542 --> 26:00.083
JEN, I REALLY NEED
TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF
UNDERGARMENTS--

26:00.083 --> 26:01.708
WHEN WE GET BACK TO L.A.,

26:01.708 --> 26:04.792
I'M PUTTING THIS KNEE
IN MY AGENT'S GROIN.

26:04.792 --> 26:05.708
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S OVER.

26:05.708 --> 26:07.708
I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT
EQUIPPED TO BE HERE.

26:07.708 --> 26:10.083
SO IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS
AND YOU NEED ANSWERS,

26:10.083 --> 26:11.875
YOU SHOULD ALL
CALL THE HELPLINE.

26:17.375 --> 26:18.291
OH, MY GOD.

26:18.291 --> 26:19.333
JEN, WHAT WAS IT LIKE
TO BE THAT CLOSE TO HIM?

26:19.333 --> 26:21.041
DID YOU GET
TO TOUCH HIM?
WHAT DOES HE SMELL LIKE?

26:21.041 --> 26:23.291
AUDREY, HOW WOULD
YOU LIKE TO SEE HIM
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL?

26:23.291 --> 26:24.542
ARE YOU SAYING WHAT
I THINK YOU'RE SAYING?

26:24.542 --> 26:26.875
YES. TAKE OVER
THE HOSTING DUTIES.

26:26.875 --> 26:28.417
OH, I THOUGHT YOU
WANTED ME TO SING.

26:28.417 --> 26:30.375
OH, WELL.
A GIG'S A GIG.
THANKS.

26:32.834 --> 26:33.917
OK, PEOPLE,

26:33.917 --> 26:35.542
SINCE OUR LOVELY HOSTESS
WITH THE MOSTESS JEN LINDLEY

26:35.542 --> 26:37.083
PICKED NOW TO HAVE
A MENTAL BREAKDOWN,

26:37.083 --> 26:38.834
I'LL BE YOUR RICKI LAKE
FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING.

26:38.834 --> 26:40.500
NOW, WHO'S GOT
THE NEXT QUESTION?

26:40.500 --> 26:42.750
YOU! UP TOP!
FUNNY SHAPED HEAD.
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

26:42.750 --> 26:45.625
UM, DR. DREW, IS IT TRUE
THAT MEN ONLY WANT SEX

26:45.625 --> 26:47.875
AND WOMEN ONLY WANT
RELATIONSHIPS?

26:47.875 --> 26:48.750
I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND
THAT AIN'T TRUE.

26:48.750 --> 26:50.458
I COULD TELL YOU
STORIES THAT WOULD
BOGGLE

26:50.458 --> 26:53.166
YOUR PEA-SIZED LITTLE
BRAIN. I ONCE--

26:53.166 --> 26:55.625
ASKED THIS GIRL
TO DO IT WHILE I WAS
DRIVING ONCE,

26:55.625 --> 26:58.125
BUT SHE GOT ALL SKETCHY.
SAID IT WASN'T SAFE--

26:58.125 --> 26:59.250
TO ENGAGE IN
HIGH RISK BEHAVIOR.

26:59.250 --> 27:00.542
IF YOU HAVE,
YOU SHOULD SEE

27:00.542 --> 27:02.250
A DOCTOR
IMMEDIATELY,
AND THEN ASK--

27:02.250 --> 27:04.917
IS SOMEONE UNDER 5 FEET
CONSIDERED A MIDGET?

27:04.917 --> 27:06.917
OFFICIAL MIDGET
HEIGHT IS

27:06.917 --> 27:09.959
IF I'M WEARING
A PAIR OF STILETTOS
AND I CAN REST MY--

27:09.959 --> 27:12.583
THIS LASER'S
NOT A MAGIC WAND.

27:12.583 --> 27:13.834
NOT A PANACEA, YEAH.

27:13.834 --> 27:15.291
YEAH, PEOPLE THINK
IT'S A--WHAT DID YOU
SAY IT WAS?

27:15.291 --> 27:18.583
PANACEA. CURE-ALL.

27:18.583 --> 27:20.959
DURING SEX, SHE LIKES
TO LISTEN TO POP GOES
THE WEASEL.

27:20.959 --> 27:21.583
IS THAT--IS THAT WEIRD?

27:21.583 --> 27:22.625
THAT MAY BE
WHERE THE SOURCE

27:22.625 --> 27:24.792
OF YOUR SEXUAL
DYSFUNCTION COMES FROM.

27:24.792 --> 27:25.542
IS IT OK
TO USE A VIBRATOR?

27:25.542 --> 27:26.542
GREAT QUESTION.
BUT I THINK

27:26.542 --> 27:29.625
HE HAS SOME FEELINGS
ABOUT THAT. ADAM?

27:29.625 --> 27:30.917
WELL, I DID A TEST
WITH DREW ONCE,

27:30.917 --> 27:33.500
WHERE I JUST COVERED
THE LEFT SIDE
OF HIS FACE WITH--

27:33.500 --> 27:35.834
WHENEVER YOU HAVE
AN ABNORMALITY THAT WAY,

27:35.834 --> 27:39.792
IT INCREASES YOUR CHANCES
OF BEING AN EVIL GENIUS.

27:39.792 --> 27:40.917
WELL, WHAT I REALLY
WANT TO KNOW IS--

27:40.917 --> 27:42.208
ARE YOU TAKING
ANY MEDICATION?

27:42.208 --> 27:44.166
IS IT TRUE I CAN'T
GET PREGNANT
ON A FULL MOON?

27:44.166 --> 27:45.208
ARE YOU ON
ANY MEDICATION?

27:45.208 --> 27:49.000
I'VE GOT THIS BAD
BURNING SENSATION.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.333
ARE YOU ON
ANY MEDICATION?

27:50.333 --> 27:53.458
WHAT IS THE AVERAGE SIZE
OF THE MALE GENITALIA?

27:53.458 --> 27:55.792
FLUOXETINE.
I MEAN REALLY BAD.

27:55.792 --> 27:57.458
CITALOPHRAM.
IT'S LIKE I'M ON FIRE.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.083
FLUVOXAMINE.
SERTRALINE.

27:59.083 --> 28:00.250
PROPRION.
BUSPIRONE.

28:00.250 --> 28:01.542
HOW SMALL IS SMALL?

28:01.542 --> 28:04.000
WHICH IS A GENETIC
BIOLOGICAL DISEASE

28:04.000 --> 28:05.834
WHICH COULD LEAD
TO CONSUMING
PROGRESSIVE AMOUNTS OF--

28:05.834 --> 28:06.667
WHIPPED CREAM.
AND MAKE SURE

28:06.667 --> 28:09.333
YOU HAVE PLENTY
OF IT, OR ELSE!

28:09.333 --> 28:10.917
THE MEN THAT WANT
THEIR WOMEN TO LOOK

28:10.917 --> 28:12.375
LIKE LITTLE BOYS
THAT CAUSE THEM--

28:12.375 --> 28:14.041
DEPRESSION
AND ANXIETY,

28:14.041 --> 28:15.000
WHICH CAN HAVE
BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL

28:15.000 --> 28:17.834
AND BIOLOGICAL
ELEMENTS TO IT,
AND HOPEFULLY--

28:17.834 --> 28:19.667
THAT ANSWERS
YOUR QUESTION.

28:19.667 --> 28:21.708
OK, PEOPLE, THAT'S
ALL THE TIME WE HAVE
FOR THIS EVENING.

28:21.708 --> 28:23.667
REMEMBER SOMETHING--
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF
ALONE AND DEPRESSED

28:23.667 --> 28:26.458
IN A ROOM
SITTING UNDER A BARE BULB

28:26.458 --> 28:27.917
IF A PILE OF YOUR OWN SICK,

28:27.917 --> 28:29.959
PLEASE DON'T CALL ME,
CALL THE HELPLINE.

28:29.959 --> 28:32.000
HAVE A GREAT EVENING.

28:36.291 --> 28:38.875
SO, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

28:38.875 --> 28:41.542
TO YOU, ME, A COUPLE OF
NON-ALCOHOLIC BEERS,

28:41.542 --> 28:44.542
AND A SHINY
NEW THERMOMETER?

28:44.542 --> 28:47.959
BABY, YOU'RE
READING MY MIND.

28:47.959 --> 28:49.875
UGH!

29:05.708 --> 29:07.417
WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE
DOING BACK HERE?

29:07.417 --> 29:08.917
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR AUDREY.

29:08.917 --> 29:10.000
HELLO. WE DROVE
HER HERE.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.917
THEN WE GET HOME
AND PUT THIS HORRID
NIGHT BEHIND US.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.250
YEAH, BUT WE
HAVEN'T SOLVED
OUR LITTLE PROBLEM.

29:15.250 --> 29:16.500
EDDIE!

29:16.500 --> 29:18.041
GOOD GOD, SON!

29:18.041 --> 29:19.750
ARE YOU STILL
HARPING ON THAT?

29:19.750 --> 29:21.291
WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE THE GIRL A BREAK?

29:21.291 --> 29:22.583
HAVE YOU TAKEN A LOOK
AT HER LATELY?

29:22.583 --> 29:24.000
YOU'RE LUCKY
A CHICK THAT HOT

29:24.000 --> 29:27.375
LET'S YOU GET NAKED
IN THE SAME BUILDING
SHE'S IN.

29:27.375 --> 29:29.792
YOU GOTTA MOVE ON.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

29:29.792 --> 29:30.250
15, 16?

29:30.250 --> 29:32.750
I'M 25.

29:32.750 --> 29:36.750
25. YOU KNOW
WHAT I WAS DOING
WHEN I WAS 25?

29:36.750 --> 29:40.542
NO, BUT I'M SURE
YOU'RE GONNA
TELL ME.

29:40.542 --> 29:41.750
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M GONNA TELL YOU.

29:41.750 --> 29:42.667
WHEN I WAS 25,
I ONLY DREAMT

29:42.667 --> 29:44.917
OF GETTING
WITH CHICKS THIS HOT.

29:44.917 --> 29:48.250
I WAS IN
MY PARENTS' BASEMENT
LOOKING AT MY RAFT BOX.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.625
HAD A PICTURE
OF A GAL ON IT.

29:50.625 --> 29:51.959
SHE WAS WEARING A BIKINI
AND FLOATING ON A RAFT,

29:51.959 --> 29:55.542
AND I JUST STARED
AT THAT THING
UNTIL I WAS CROSS-EYED.

29:55.542 --> 30:00.458
I MISS THAT RAFT BOX.

30:00.458 --> 30:01.875
THAT'S...WEIRD.

30:01.875 --> 30:04.041
YEAH, YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
IT'S WEIRD.

30:04.041 --> 30:05.583
AND THAT'S MY POINT.

30:05.583 --> 30:06.750
I'M TIRED OF YOU
COLLEGE KIDS COMPLAINING

30:06.750 --> 30:09.083
AND BELLYACHING
ALL THE TIME.

30:09.083 --> 30:10.291
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE,

30:10.291 --> 30:12.125
WE DIDN'T HAVE CHICKS
THAT DRESSED LIKE THIS.

30:12.125 --> 30:15.083
WITH THEIR BELLY TEES,
AND THEIR HIP HUGGERS,

30:15.083 --> 30:16.792
AND THEIR THONGS
HANGING OUT THE BACK.

30:16.792 --> 30:20.500
NO, NO,
WE HAD IT TOUGH.

30:20.500 --> 30:21.291
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

30:21.291 --> 30:23.959
YOU'D BE WITH THIS GUY
IF YOU THOUGHT

30:23.959 --> 30:25.959
YOU COULD
TRUST HIM, RIGHT?

30:34.250 --> 30:36.875
YEAH.

30:36.875 --> 30:39.333
THERE YOU GO, SPORT.
ALL YOU GOTTA DO
IS GAIN HER TRUST

30:39.333 --> 30:41.333
AND YOU'RE IN LIKE
FLINT, ALL RIGHT?

30:41.333 --> 30:43.667
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
MY WORK IS DONE HERE.

30:43.667 --> 30:46.083
I'M GONNA
GET SOME CHEESE.

30:48.834 --> 30:50.667
SO, IS THAT TRUE?
YOU DON'T TRUST ME?

30:50.667 --> 30:53.667
WELL, CAN YOU BLAME ME?

30:54.125 --> 30:56.291
NO.

30:56.291 --> 30:59.792
EDDIE...

30:59.792 --> 31:03.625
WE'RE LIVING THIS FANTASY.

31:03.625 --> 31:05.667
AND--AND WE'VE...

31:05.667 --> 31:07.834
BEEN DOING IT
EVER SINCE YOU GOT BACK.

31:07.834 --> 31:11.708
AND AS NICE
AS THE FANTASY IS...

31:11.708 --> 31:14.625
IT'S GONNA HAVE TO END
SOONER OR LATER.

31:14.625 --> 31:16.125
WELL,
SINCE YOU PUT IT
THAT WAY, JOEY,

31:16.125 --> 31:18.000
I CHOOSE LATER.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.375
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU FEEL,

31:21.375 --> 31:24.959
AND I'M SORRY
THAT I GAVE YOU
A HARD TIME.

31:24.959 --> 31:27.667
BUT THERE'S
NOTHING I CAN SAY
TO EARN YOUR TRUST.

31:28.708 --> 31:31.375
SO, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO TAKE
A LEAP OF FAITH.

31:31.375 --> 31:34.125
OK, AND KNOW THAT

31:34.125 --> 31:36.792
I LOVE YOU
MORE THAN ANYTHING
IN THIS WORLD.

31:36.792 --> 31:38.875
OK?

31:51.875 --> 31:53.792
OK, COME ON.

31:53.792 --> 31:54.625
WERE WE GOING?

31:54.625 --> 31:56.875
BACK TO MY ROOM
BEFORE AUDREY GETS BACK.

31:56.875 --> 31:58.250
BUT WE DROVE HER
HERE.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.708
SHE'S NOT GONNA BE
ABLE TO GET BACK
TO THE--

31:59.708 --> 32:01.875
EXACTLY!

32:08.583 --> 32:10.583
YOU KNOW...

32:10.583 --> 32:13.083
TONIGHT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE
A COMPLETE DISASTER.

32:13.083 --> 32:14.792
IF WE HURRY,
WE CAN STILL
MAKE IT TO THE BARS.

32:14.792 --> 32:16.166
MAYBE YOU CAN FIND
SOME NICE GUY

32:16.166 --> 32:16.917
FOR ME TO OPENLY
FLIRT WITH.

32:16.917 --> 32:18.959
AM I SUPPOSED TO BE
AMUSED BY THAT?

32:18.959 --> 32:20.375
YES, DAVID, YOU ARE.

32:20.375 --> 32:22.625
OH.

32:22.625 --> 32:25.583
BUT SINCE YOU'RE NOT,

32:25.583 --> 32:26.917
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST SAY
WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY

32:26.917 --> 32:28.125
AND LET'S GET THIS
OVER WITH.

32:28.125 --> 32:30.041
AND YOU DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING THAT
YOU WANT TO SAY?

32:30.041 --> 32:31.291
HONESTLY, NO,
BECAUSE IN MY MIND

32:31.291 --> 32:32.834
THERE'S NOTHING WORTH
EVEN TALKING ABOUT.

32:32.834 --> 32:36.083
IT'S JUST A STUPID
MISUNDERSTANDING

32:36.083 --> 32:39.291
THAT YOU SEEM INTENT
ON BLOWING UP
INTO A MUCH LARGER DEAL.

32:39.291 --> 32:42.625
OK. SO, JUST TO CLARIFY,

32:42.625 --> 32:45.083
I'M CRAZY,
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA
EVEN ATTEMPT AN APOLOGY.

32:45.083 --> 32:48.750
I WAS JUST TALKING
WITH THE GUY, DAVID.
THAT'S IT.

32:48.750 --> 32:50.458
IT'S LIKE JEN SAID.
ALL RIGHT, I'M JUST--

32:50.458 --> 32:53.125
I WAS BEING NICE.
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M TRYING
TO COMMUNICATE ANYTHING.

32:53.125 --> 32:54.667
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M TRYING
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BAD.

32:54.667 --> 32:58.041
YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:58.041 --> 32:59.667
I'M BEGINNING
TO THINK MAYBE
I SHOULD'VE TRUSTED

32:59.667 --> 33:01.250
MY ORIGINAL
INSTINCTS ABOUT YOU.

33:01.250 --> 33:03.500
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

33:03.500 --> 33:05.291
LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO
BREAK UP WITH ME

33:05.291 --> 33:06.083
OVER SOMETHING
THIS MINOR, JUST DO IT.

33:06.083 --> 33:10.333
WOW. THAT'S THE FIRST
PLACE YOU GO?

33:10.333 --> 33:11.917
WHAT?
YOU'RE WORSE THAN JEN.

33:11.917 --> 33:12.917
OR MAYBE YOU TWO HAVE
BEEN HANGING OUT SO LONG

33:12.917 --> 33:14.291
YOU'VE JUST BECOME
THE SAME PERSON.

33:14.291 --> 33:15.542
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING--

33:15.542 --> 33:16.667
YOU KNOW,
FOR A MASTER COMMUNICATOR,

33:16.667 --> 33:18.291
YOU'RE NOT EXPRESSING
YOURSELF TOO WELL RIGHT NOW.

33:18.291 --> 33:19.291
WE WERE HAVING
A TINY LITTLE
ARGUMENT,

33:19.291 --> 33:21.291
AND IN 2 SECONDS,
YOU JUST MANAGED
TO SNOWBALL IT

33:21.291 --> 33:21.792
INTO SOMETHING
CATASTROPHIC.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.834
OH, RIGHT. I MANAGE.

33:23.834 --> 33:25.417
AND YOU WEREN'T AT ALL
BEING PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE.

33:25.417 --> 33:27.166
I AM NOT THE ONE
WHO'S LOOKING FOR
A WAY OUT OF THIS.

33:27.166 --> 33:28.875
AND I AM? AND I AM?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:28.875 --> 33:29.834
IF YOU'RE BORED,
IF YOU'RE IN
OVER YOUR HEAD,

33:29.834 --> 33:31.000
THAN JUST SAY SO.
DID I SAY THAT?!

33:31.000 --> 33:32.125
FINE, FINE.

33:32.125 --> 33:33.291
BUT I AM NOT
JUST GONNA DUMP YOU

33:33.291 --> 33:35.208
SO THAT YOU CAN
WALK AWAY FROM THIS
GUILT-FREE.

33:35.208 --> 33:37.333
GUILT F--

33:37.333 --> 33:39.834
DAVID, I AM GUILT-FREE.
I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

33:39.834 --> 33:40.708
RIGHT.

33:40.708 --> 33:41.750
WHAT? OH, GREAT, WHAT?
YOU'RE LEAVING NOW?

33:41.750 --> 33:43.917
YES. BUT BEFORE I DO,

33:43.917 --> 33:45.333
I'M GONNA MAKE THIS
REALLY SIMPLE FOR YOU.

33:45.333 --> 33:48.375
EITHER APOLOGIZE TO ME
OR BREAK UP WITH ME.

33:48.375 --> 33:49.500
OH, FINE, OK,
WHATEVER. SORRY.

33:49.500 --> 33:54.333
NO. NO, NO, NO.

33:54.333 --> 33:56.000
I DESERVE
BETTER THAN THAT.

33:57.875 --> 34:01.917
TAKE A DAY.
HELL, TAKE A WEEK.

34:01.917 --> 34:04.667
THINK ABOUT IT,
AND LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU DECIDE.

34:25.166 --> 34:27.417
WAIT, C.J. WAIT.
LET ME EXPLAIN.

34:29.125 --> 34:30.667
WAIT, WILL YOU PLEASE
JUST LET ME EXPLAIN?

34:30.667 --> 34:31.708
YOU KNOW, JEN,
I THINK I'VE HEARD

34:31.708 --> 34:32.875
ALL I NEED
TO HEAR TONIGHT.

34:32.875 --> 34:35.333
LOOK, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.
I--I NEED YOUR HELP.

34:35.333 --> 34:37.833
OH, YOU NEED MY HELP?
WELL, YOU SAID IT
EARLIER.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.000
WHY DON'T YOU CALL
THE FRIGGIN' HELPLINE?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.708
OK, I WILL. RING-RING!

34:41.708 --> 34:44.417
AW, MAN, I REALLY HOPE
SOMEBODY PICKS UP.
RING-RING!

34:44.417 --> 34:45.875
I'M NOT GONNA
DO THIS.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.291
OH, COME ON.
YOU'VE GOT A CRAZY GIRL

34:47.291 --> 34:48.417
ON THE OTHER END
OF THE LINE

34:48.417 --> 34:50.041
AND SHE MIGHT DO
SOMETHING IRRATIONAL

34:50.041 --> 34:52.375
IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE
SOMEBODY TO TALK TO.
RING-RING.

34:57.250 --> 34:58.500
HELLO?

34:58.500 --> 35:00.959
HI. IS THIS THE HELPLINE?
YES.

35:00.959 --> 35:03.417
UH, BECAUSE YOU
DIDN'T SAY HELPLINE
WHEN YOU ANSWERED.

35:03.417 --> 35:04.917
HELLO. HELPLINE.

35:04.917 --> 35:08.083
UH, WHO AM I
SPEAKING WITH?

35:08.083 --> 35:09.542
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
GIVE ME YOUR NAME, EITHER.

35:09.542 --> 35:12.125
HELLO. HELPLINE.
THIS IS C.J. DO YOU
HAVE A CRISIS?

35:12.125 --> 35:16.000
HI, C.J.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.250
YOU HAVE
A VERY SWEET VOICE.

35:17.250 --> 35:19.792
DO YOU HAVE
A CRISIS OR NOT?

35:19.792 --> 35:21.583
YES, I DO.

35:21.583 --> 35:25.250
AND YOU SHOULD LIKE
SOMEBODY THAT I COULD TRUST,

35:25.250 --> 35:28.750
AND SOMEBODY WHO COULD
BE ENDLESSLY SYMPATHETIC

35:28.750 --> 35:30.834
WITH A GIRL WHO HAS
A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

35:30.834 --> 35:32.959
OH, WELL,
ISN'T THAT IRONIC?

35:32.959 --> 35:34.583
CONSIDERING I JUST
GOT DUMPED TODAY

35:34.583 --> 35:36.959
BY A GIRL WITH
A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

35:36.959 --> 35:38.083
OR MAYBE SHE
DOESN'T HAVE ANY?

35:38.083 --> 35:39.834
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.

35:39.834 --> 35:40.959
PERSONALLY,
I WOULDN'T KNOW

35:40.959 --> 35:41.792
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T
HAVE ENOUGH TRUST
TO CONFIDE IN ME.

35:41.792 --> 35:45.417
(SIGHS) WELL...

35:45.417 --> 35:48.750
THE THING IS
THAT MAYBE...

35:48.750 --> 35:50.291
THIS GIRL REALIZES
THAT SHE MADE A MISTAKE,

35:50.291 --> 35:52.917
BUT SHE DOESN'T
REALLY KNOW
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.

35:52.917 --> 35:54.834
WELL, MAYBE
SHE NEEDS TO START
BY REALIZING

35:54.834 --> 35:56.333
THAT WHATEVER
THE PROBLEM IS,

35:56.333 --> 35:59.333
HER BOYFRIEND'S
NOT THE ENEMY.

35:59.333 --> 36:02.250
RIGHT. WELL, SEE,
NOW, THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT THIS GIRL,

36:02.250 --> 36:04.792
IS THAT SHE HAS
A TENDENCY TO SUBSCRIBE

36:04.792 --> 36:07.125
TO SELF-DESTRUCTIVE
BEHAVIORS IN HER LIFE,

36:07.125 --> 36:09.959
AND THAT WHEN
ONE PART OF HER LIFE
ISN'T GOING WELL,

36:09.959 --> 36:13.917
SHE HAS THIS DESIRE
TO DESTROY EVERYTHING ELSE

36:13.917 --> 36:15.917
GOING ON, AND PLUS,
SHE'S NEVER
REALLY BEEN ABLE

36:15.917 --> 36:17.291
TO TRUST ANYBODY
BEFORE, SO--

36:17.291 --> 36:20.834
EVERYBODY'S GOTTA
START SOMETIME.

36:20.834 --> 36:22.750
SO--SO, WHAT?
SO WHAT DO I DO?

36:22.750 --> 36:24.625
I JUST--I JUST--
I JUST SAY WHAT IT IS

36:24.625 --> 36:28.041
THAT'S BOTHERING ME,
AND THEN I LOOK UP
AND YOU'RE STILL THERE?

36:28.041 --> 36:30.208
YES. THAT'S WHAT
THIS WHOLE BOYFRIEND
THING IS ALL ABOUT.

36:30.208 --> 36:31.625
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT
INTERESTED IN HAVING
A BOYFRIEND,

36:31.625 --> 36:32.583
I CAN CERTAINLY--

36:32.583 --> 36:36.542
SHE'S SICK.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.458
MY GRAMS IS SICK.

36:40.166 --> 36:43.625
AND SHE HAS BEEN
KEEPING IT FROM ME,

36:43.625 --> 36:44.792
AND IT'S THE REASON
THAT SHE BROKE UP
WITH YOUR UNCLE BILL,

36:44.792 --> 36:48.625
AND--AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE SHE'S BEEN
KEEPING FROM ME.

36:48.625 --> 36:50.041
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.208
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

36:52.208 --> 36:55.000
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ANYTHING,

36:55.000 --> 36:57.375
AND SO I HAD A FREAK-OUT,
ONE FREAK-OUT.

36:57.375 --> 36:59.458
IS THAT OK?

37:04.625 --> 37:06.375
YES.

37:16.959 --> 37:20.000
YEAH. TAKE AS MANY
AS YOU NEED.

37:32.917 --> 37:35.667
OOH, OOH, OOH!
JUST THE MAN
I WAS LOOKING FOR.

37:35.667 --> 37:37.750
I KNEW YOU'D
COME AROUND.
THEY ALWAYS DO.

37:37.750 --> 37:39.917
YEAH. WHERE'S DR. DREW?

37:39.917 --> 37:42.041
OH. AGAIN
WITH THE PINSKY?

37:42.041 --> 37:43.792
LISTEN,
I HATE TO TELL YOU,

37:43.792 --> 37:45.250
BUT YOUR BELOVED
DR. DREW,

37:45.250 --> 37:47.166
NOT SO GREAT WITH
THE STAYING POWER.

37:47.166 --> 37:49.000
WHAT?

37:49.000 --> 37:51.250
HE WENT
TO THE AIRPORT
RIGHT AFTER THE GIG.

37:51.250 --> 37:53.250
BUT...

37:53.250 --> 37:55.834
I NEVER GOT ANY PERSONAL
FACE TIME WITH HIM.

37:58.834 --> 37:59.708
WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

37:59.708 --> 38:02.333
EH, I LIKE
TO HANG BEHIND
AT THESE THINGS.

38:02.333 --> 38:05.000
SEE IF I CAN
SCRAPE UP
A LITTLE COED TAIL.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.417
YEAH. HAS THAT
EVER WORKED FOR YOU?

38:06.417 --> 38:09.041
NO. NO, IT HASN'T.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.291
JOEY?

38:17.291 --> 38:20.125
JEN! JACK! ANYBODY!

38:20.125 --> 38:22.458
UGH! CAN THIS NIGHT
SUCK ANY HARDER?

38:22.458 --> 38:23.917
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
MORE PRODUCTIVE WAYS

38:23.917 --> 38:25.125
TO MANAGE
AGGRESSION.

38:25.125 --> 38:27.792
LISTEN, BUDDY--OH!

38:27.792 --> 38:31.542
HI! DR. DREW, I--

38:31.542 --> 38:33.000
I WASN'T
ANGRY JUST NOW.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.291
I WAS JUST--I WAS
PRACTICING FOR A PLAY.

38:36.291 --> 38:38.291
YOU KNOW, "STELLA,
STELLA," ALL THAT.

38:38.291 --> 38:39.458
SO YOU'RE AN ACTRESS?

38:39.458 --> 38:42.750
WELL...I AM.

38:42.750 --> 38:45.125
BUT, YOU KNOW,
MORE SO IN LIFE,

38:45.125 --> 38:46.875
I GUESS, THAN IN ART.

38:46.875 --> 38:47.917
I HAVE A BIT OF A FLAIR
FOR THE DRAMATIC.

38:47.917 --> 38:49.917
YOU DON'T SAY.

38:49.917 --> 38:53.542
YEAH.

38:53.542 --> 38:55.166
ALTHOUGH...

38:55.166 --> 38:56.250
I SHOULD KIND OF
POINT OUT

38:56.250 --> 39:00.333
I--I WASN'T ENTIRELY
LYING ABOUT...

39:00.333 --> 39:03.083
THE WHOLE REHAB THING.

39:03.083 --> 39:04.834
I MEAN, IT HAPPENED,

39:04.834 --> 39:07.333
THAT WHOLE
PART OF MY LIFE.

39:07.333 --> 39:09.834
AND IT WASN'T PRETTY,

39:09.834 --> 39:12.834
HAVING TO FACE MYSELF
AND ALL THAT.

39:12.834 --> 39:16.333
BUT EVERY NIGHT

39:16.333 --> 39:18.708
AFTER A LONG DAY'S
WHINING,

39:18.708 --> 39:20.625
I WOULD LIE IN BED
AND I WOULD
BUG MY ROOMMATE

39:20.625 --> 39:22.375
BY LISTENING
TO YOU GUYS GIVE ADVICE

39:22.375 --> 39:24.834
TO ALL THOSE OTHER
LOSERS OUT THERE
IN RADIOLAND,

39:24.834 --> 39:26.834
AND...I DON'T KNOW.

39:26.834 --> 39:29.417
IT JUST, IT...

39:29.417 --> 39:30.667
MADE ME FEEL
LESS ALONE.

39:33.166 --> 39:34.417
SO...

39:34.417 --> 39:36.583
WELL, I GUESS I JUST
WANT TO SAY THANK YOU.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.041
FOR BEING YOU, AND...

39:42.041 --> 39:45.166
THE TRUTH IS...

39:45.166 --> 39:47.000
I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD'VE
DONE IT WITHOUT YOU.

39:53.083 --> 39:56.708
PLUS, YOU'RE, LIKE,
TOTALLY HOT.

39:56.708 --> 39:58.208
HA HA HA!

39:58.208 --> 40:00.417
AUDREY, DO YOU
WANT A RIDE?

40:00.417 --> 40:01.708
OH, I WOULD LOVE ONE.

40:01.708 --> 40:02.875
BUT I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE MARRIED,

40:02.875 --> 40:04.417
SO WE MUST KEEP
OUR DISTANCE, DREW.

40:04.417 --> 40:09.542
I'LL TRY.

40:09.542 --> 40:12.875
SO, YOU MUST HAVE,
LIKE, A BOATLOAD
OF GROUPIES, HUH?

40:12.875 --> 40:14.625
A FEW.

40:16.041 --> 40:18.792
YEAH. DON'T YOU
KIND OF HATE
GIRLS LIKE THAT?
