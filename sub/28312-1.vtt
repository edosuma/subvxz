00:32.241 --> 00:33.450
<i>from Miguel Galindez.</i>

00:41.750 --> 00:43.544
<i>Here we have Bayoneta,</i>
<i>always pushing forward,</i>

00:43.627 --> 00:47.047
<i>imposing himself on the ring.</i>

00:47.130 --> 00:50.759
<i>What a hook Duarte has received!</i>

00:50.884 --> 00:53.845
<i>Who goes down early in this fight.</i>

00:53.971 --> 00:56.848
<i>There's the referee</i>

00:56.974 --> 01:00.310

01:35.262 --> 01:36.263
Are you okay?

01:38.432 --> 01:39.933
This is how it is, man.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.103
Huh?

01:45.480 --> 01:46.565
Yeah.

01:48.859 --> 01:49.985
It's over.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.530
Okay.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.945
-Miguel?
-Stop it, Miguel!

02:34.488 --> 02:37.199
What's going on, Dennis?

02:37.366 --> 02:38.742
What's wrong?

03:22.953 --> 03:24.830
Hey! Good morning! Morning!

03:34.172 --> 03:36.967
-Hi!
-Bye, bye!

04:33.023 --> 04:34.566
Where are you, man?

04:38.695 --> 04:40.322
Where are you, man?

04:42.866 --> 04:44.367
Where are you, man?

04:49.164 --> 04:50.665
Which way was it?

07:42.337 --> 07:44.297
Is anyone going to sauna?

08:39.352 --> 08:42.022
Fuck, fuck! Goddammit!

11:16.593 --> 11:19.262
<i>-Hello? Who is this?</i>
<i>-Hang up that phone, Yovana.</i>

11:41.868 --> 11:43.161
Yovana.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.827
All right, again! Go on!
Leave him no chance!

12:26.371 --> 12:29.123
Remu! Are you gonna win
the championship for us?

12:32.293 --> 12:33.253
Sarita!

12:33.962 --> 12:35.129
-Hi!
-Hi!

12:41.344 --> 12:43.721
One beer,
and a soda water for me.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.123
Cheers!

13:10.206 --> 13:11.291
Cheers!

13:30.685 --> 13:31.936
Okay, hey.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.703
Karaoke here this Saturday.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.565
-Hello.
-Hi.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.651
I've come to see Ramiro.

15:46.571 --> 15:47.488
Come in.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.450
-Dad...
-What's up?

15:50.658 --> 15:51.993
...someone's looking for you.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.662
-What's up?
-What's going on, man?

15:54.912 --> 15:57.081
Look who's here! Fucking Snowman
himself is in the house!

15:57.206 --> 15:58.916
-How are you doing, Baby?
-Good.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.085
-I'm fine. And you?
-Cool, man. What's new?

16:01.210 --> 16:03.629
-Not much.
-Big secret you had there, fucker!

16:03.838 --> 16:06.799
You've probably already told the Vikings
everything about me, man.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.134
The only Baby left in you

16:08.259 --> 16:09.844
-is your nickname, right?
-Baby?

16:10.261 --> 16:12.138
Come here, son!

16:12.263 --> 16:13.431
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:13.556 --> 16:15.433
Even if he looks
like a skinny-ass dog,

16:15.683 --> 16:18.186
he was the best
of the 2004 Olympic team.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.731
Bayoneta Galindez.
With a medal and everything.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.317
-Nice to meet you.
-It's nice to meet you too.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.528
-Do you remember, you horny fuck?
-About what?

16:27.612 --> 16:30.865
You wanted to fuck all
of the Chinese swimming team.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.950
You wanted to fuck
the entire Olympic Villa.

16:33.034 --> 16:35.745
Bullshit, man! You're crazy.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.997
-Look at this gut. Don Nacho.
-What's up, Don Nacho?

16:38.122 --> 16:39.165
-Want a beer, Mickey?
-Yeah.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.958
-It's been so long, Mickey.
-How are you?

16:41.125 --> 16:45.087
I was really happy to know
you were working here.

16:45.546 --> 16:46.714
Thanks.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.091
And with that fucker, Dennis.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.219
How did that happen?

16:51.928 --> 16:53.054
Well...

16:53.763 --> 16:56.349
It was a surprise for me too.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.311
Hey, Mickey.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.688
Are you sure you didn't teach
our style to the Vikings?

17:02.772 --> 17:04.398
Shut up, kid!

17:04.649 --> 17:05.691
But tell me...

17:05.858 --> 17:07.610
What is that dude's Kryptonite?

17:07.693 --> 17:09.403
Should I kick his balls
or bite his nipples?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.447
Just put a bottle of vodka
in his dressing room

17:11.531 --> 17:12.740
and you'll see.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.244
Here's a gift.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.829
-Come on!
-Some chilies, man.

17:18.913 --> 17:21.332
-So you sit down and eat them.
-What a present.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.417
That's great, man!

17:23.501 --> 17:25.378
-Do you have salsas too?
-We have some!

17:34.637 --> 17:35.638
<i>Hello?</i>

17:38.849 --> 17:40.017
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Erika?

17:42.603 --> 17:43.646
<i>Miguel?</i>

17:44.438 --> 17:45.815
How's Yovana?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.150
<i>Is it really you?</i>

17:51.654 --> 17:52.780
<i>Is it you?</i>

17:55.366 --> 17:56.576
<i>Weren't you dead?</i>

17:58.202 --> 18:01.247
I would like to talk to her
if it's okay with you.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.418
<i>She grew up, Miguel.</i>

18:08.629 --> 18:10.006
I want to help, Erika.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.467
I want you to count on me.

18:15.219 --> 18:18.598
Maybe I could be a father
to Yovana again...

18:19.682 --> 18:22.268
I have a job here, and some money
is coming and....

18:24.145 --> 18:25.354
...I want to come back.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.983
Get my life back.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.779
<i>And now you return from the dead</i>
<i>four years later.</i>

18:35.281 --> 18:37.033
<i>Fuck you, Miguel!</i>

20:05.371 --> 20:06.997
Lift the elbow. Put up the elbow.

23:28.282 --> 23:29.783
Go on, Jyrki! Kill him!

23:43.297 --> 23:45.925
-I invested into this, like...
-Yeah, you did. I know.

24:05.361 --> 24:08.530
A little sip of Jallu.
Go on, take some.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.582
-I chose wrong, you know.
-It's not his fault.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.336
Goddammit!

24:24.088 --> 24:26.632
Hey, hey, hey!
Like... what? Jyrki?

24:27.716 --> 24:28.884
You can't fuckin'...

24:29.259 --> 24:31.345
What? Come on, now, Jyrki! Hello!

24:31.470 --> 24:34.515
It's me, Jaakko. Come on, now! Seriously.

24:36.517 --> 24:37.685
Everything's all right.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.811
Okay, I get it.

24:38.936 --> 24:40.562
I get it. I get it.

24:41.271 --> 24:42.648
Goddammit...

24:43.941 --> 24:47.861
Oh, Jyrki... look at you...

24:49.446 --> 24:50.948
Nighty night.

24:51.281 --> 24:57.454
Thank you, Sir Jaakko,
for taking care of a friend.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.797
-Let's go!
-Where?

25:06.880 --> 25:08.590
Let's go to the bar!

25:10.884 --> 25:15.889
Party, a couple of <i>los halogenos</i>,
you know...

30:04.970 --> 30:06.138
Can I have another one?

30:14.813 --> 30:16.064
There you go.

32:12.806 --> 32:15.600
<i>Galindez keeps showing great leg power</i>

32:15.684 --> 32:18.270
<i>despite the punishment he received</i>
<i>from the hands of the Nicaraguan.</i>

32:18.353 --> 32:20.689
<i>He tries again with a jab,</i>
<i>he tries again to combine them,</i>

32:20.772 --> 32:22.941
<i>he takes a breath</i>
<i>to try to find possible gaps,</i>

32:23.024 --> 32:24.860
<i>in the defense of Madrigal Rivas.</i>

32:24.943 --> 32:27.446
<i>Watch out!</i>
<i>That left punch really did harm!</i>

32:27.529 --> 32:29.906
<i>Galindez goes ahead,</i>
<i>he takes him to the ropes!</i>

32:29.990 --> 32:33.201
<i>One, two! Another one! Left!</i>
<i>And the referee stops the fight!</i>

32:33.577 --> 32:38.415
<i>Another triumph for this young man</i>
<i>who is breaking all of the predictions!</i>

32:38.498 --> 32:42.502
<i>He has imposed to the Matador</i>
<i>Madrigal Rivas, a fearless fighter!</i>

32:42.586 --> 32:45.255
<i>He celebrates in his corner,</i>
<i>and now we watch the replay!</i>

32:45.380 --> 32:49.134
<i>The moment when Galindez penetrates</i>
<i>Madrigal Rivas's defense</i>

32:49.217 --> 32:50.760
<i>with great technique.</i>

32:50.844 --> 32:54.181
<i>Watch out for Bayoneta,</i>
<i>as he could be one of the next aces</i>

32:54.264 --> 32:56.766
<i>of Mexican boxing.</i>

32:56.892 --> 33:00.937
<i>He has a strong right and an Olympic past,</i>
<i>remember him from Sydney.</i>

33:01.021 --> 33:05.025
<i>He's now in the international leagues,</i>
<i>my friends.</i>

34:46.793 --> 34:47.961
Shit!

35:19.534 --> 35:23.204
Is this your number, Dad?

38:37.899 --> 38:39.734
Three 30's, and four...

38:43.196 --> 38:44.739
Okay, I'll take it from here.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.249
<i>The time has come</i>

41:42.375 --> 41:45.712
<i>Chatita my dear, to talk</i>

41:46.963 --> 41:50.049
<i>Without lies</i>

41:53.386 --> 41:55.596
<i>I waited so long</i>

41:55.722 --> 41:59.350
<i>For you to change and you</i>

42:00.268 --> 42:03.771
<i>Won't even look at me</i>

42:07.525 --> 42:10.236
<i>At first you said</i>

42:10.319 --> 42:17.201
<i>That when the snows of January came</i>

42:19.662 --> 42:23.708
<i>We would go see the Virgin</i>

42:23.833 --> 42:29.422
<i>And get married</i>

42:33.134 --> 42:37.597
<i>The snows of January have gone</i>

42:38.473 --> 42:42.769
<i>And the flowers of May have come</i>

42:43.436 --> 42:48.066
<i>You see, I've taken it like a real man</i>

42:49.067 --> 42:51.861
<i>And my bitter pain...</i>

43:43.162 --> 43:44.163
Hi!

43:44.622 --> 43:45.957
Did everything go well?

43:46.415 --> 43:49.919
Yeah. He had his evening meal
and went to bed already.

43:50.002 --> 43:51.671
That's great. Thank you so much.

43:53.464 --> 43:54.799
Be safe.

43:55.049 --> 43:56.300
I will.

48:50.678 --> 48:52.179
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:03:50.327 --> 1:03:52.954
<i>Seems like everyone's bet</i>
<i>their money on you,</i>

1:03:53.079 --> 1:03:54.205
<i>how does that feel?</i>

1:03:54.414 --> 1:03:55.707
<i>I don't care about money at all.</i>

1:03:55.957 --> 1:03:57.292
<i>I've trained hard for this fight,</i>

1:03:57.392 --> 1:03:59.895
<i>that's all I care about.</i>

1:05:05.985 --> 1:05:07.070
<i>Hello?</i>

1:05:09.697 --> 1:05:10.698
<i>Hello?</i>

1:05:12.992 --> 1:05:14.661
Hi Yovana, how are you?

1:05:16.621 --> 1:05:17.914
I'm your dad.

1:05:21.543 --> 1:05:23.670
Please don't hang up.

1:05:24.504 --> 1:05:25.797
<i>What do you want?</i>

1:05:26.923 --> 1:05:29.008
I'm going to Tijuana and...

1:05:29.801 --> 1:05:33.680
Do you remember
when we used to eat lobster at Cosmos?

1:05:34.514 --> 1:05:35.682
<i>Yes...</i>

1:05:38.226 --> 1:05:41.104
I was thinking
that maybe we could go there...

1:05:42.730 --> 1:05:45.650
...and then we could go to the beach
if you want to.

1:05:46.860 --> 1:05:49.487
<i>They closed that place a long time ago.</i>

1:05:49.946 --> 1:05:51.865
<i>There was a shooting.</i>

1:05:54.784 --> 1:05:56.703
<i>Why did you leave?</i>

SEAFOOD

1:08:50.376 --> 1:08:56.174
<i>Dear friends, the big question</i>
<i>that's surely on everyone's lips is</i>

1:08:56.257 --> 1:08:59.719
<i>if Miguel "Bayoneta" Galindez</i>
<i>is really ready to fight</i>

1:08:59.802 --> 1:09:01.846
<i>at the top of his weight class?</i>

1:09:36.422 --> 1:09:37.965
<i>The crowd goes wild.</i>

1:09:38.049 --> 1:09:41.094
<i>Did we witness another quick knockout</i>
<i>by the Scandinavian champion?</i>

1:09:47.016 --> 1:09:50.186
<i>Balasevic lands a straight right</i>
<i>on Bayoneta's chin,</i>

1:09:50.269 --> 1:09:52.897
<i>sending him to the canvas like a ragdoll.</i>

1:10:09.163 --> 1:10:10.248
<i>Balasevic attacks.</i>

1:10:10.331 --> 1:10:12.625
<i>If the Mexican wishes</i>
<i>to counter that flurry fists,</i>

1:10:12.709 --> 1:10:17.296
<i>he has to at least find some of that old,</i>
<i>famous Bayoneta in him.</i>

1:11:10.641 --> 1:11:14.312
<i>Balasevic is undoubtedly</i>
<i>one of Sweden's most talented boxers,</i>

1:11:14.437 --> 1:11:18.232
<i>and his ability to take in the punches</i>
<i>is truly admirable.</i>

1:11:18.316 --> 1:11:21.486
<i>But today, he has been steamrollered</i>
<i>by a man whose comeback</i>

1:11:21.569 --> 1:11:25.615
<i>seemed unlikely</i>
<i>after the last tragic fight.</i>

1:11:51.182 --> 1:11:52.558
What did you say?

1:12:23.297 --> 1:12:27.260
<i>And look at this, people.</i>
<i>What is this man made of?</i>

1:12:27.385 --> 1:12:33.516
<i>The Swede's chin must be made of steel,</i>
<i>and his body of granite.</i>

1:12:33.975 --> 1:12:36.769
<i>Balasevic is up, looking like</i>
<i>he wants to see the fight through</i>

1:12:36.853 --> 1:12:38.646
<i>to the end no matter what.</i>

1:13:02.336 --> 1:13:03.254
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1:13:03.629 --> 1:13:06.424
<i>what at first seemed like</i>
<i>a walk in the park for Balasevic</i>

1:13:06.549 --> 1:13:09.468
<i>has turned into a nightmare.</i>

1:13:22.565 --> 1:13:24.525
<i>Something's definitely wrong</i>
<i>with Bayoneta.</i>

1:13:24.692 --> 1:13:26.360
<i>He's hardly countering</i>
<i>any of the punches.</i>

1:13:26.444 --> 1:13:28.446
<i>He turns his back to his opponent.</i>

1:13:37.163 --> 1:13:38.581
<i>Bayoneta is no longer fighting,</i>

1:13:38.664 --> 1:13:41.042
<i>which leads to his disqualification.</i>

1:16:57.947 --> 1:17:04.411
<i>There it is, once again, the sharp</i>
<i>cutting jab from Miguel Galindez.</i>

1:17:04.662 --> 1:17:07.456
<i>Dictating the perimeter of action</i>
<i>and conditioning the movements</i>

1:17:07.540 --> 1:17:09.625
<i>of a confused "Tremendo" Duarte.</i>

1:17:13.087 --> 1:17:15.923
<i>It's madness over here</i>
<i>at the tenth round.</i>

1:17:17.133 --> 1:17:20.052
<i>Who is there to blame for this atrocity?</i>

1:17:20.261 --> 1:17:23.180
<i>A savage thing to do from both corners.</i>

1:17:23.264 --> 1:17:27.685
<i>Why are the referee or the medical team</i>
<i>waiting to end this?</i>

1:17:27.768 --> 1:17:31.480
<i>One, two, three, four...</i>

1:17:57.756 --> 1:17:59.967
<i>from Las Vegas, Nevada.</i>

1:18:01.177 --> 1:18:04.889
From Libertad, Tijuana!

1:18:05.014 --> 1:18:07.558
<i>Miguel...</i>

1:18:07.683 --> 1:18:09.560
<i>"Bayoneta"...</i>

1:18:09.685 --> 1:18:11.437
<i>Galindez!</i>

1:19:32.101 --> 1:19:34.103
Fucking shit, man.

1:19:55.874 --> 1:19:58.168
Hail Mary full of Grace,
the Lord is with thee.

1:19:58.377 --> 1:20:01.171
Blessed are thou among women and blessed
is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.

1:20:01.839 --> 1:20:03.882
What do you think about your dad, Yovana?

1:20:05.467 --> 1:20:07.303
I'm greater than you, fuckers.

1:20:07.386 --> 1:20:09.388
Champion of nothing, yes sir.

1:20:09.805 --> 1:20:10.973
Champion of nothing.

1:22:25.107 --> 1:22:26.358
What's wrong?

1:22:27.443 --> 1:22:28.694
My love...

1:22:28.819 --> 1:22:30.195
What's wrong?

1:22:38.245 --> 1:22:39.538
What's wrong?

1:22:45.961 --> 1:22:47.379
Where are you going?

1:22:48.422 --> 1:22:50.716
Where are you going, Miguel?

1:23:17.034 --> 1:23:18.494
Everything is in order.

1:23:19.620 --> 1:23:22.331
The bandaging seems legal.
But we're still going to run some tests.

1:23:24.708 --> 1:23:26.210
You can go now.

1:24:21.932 --> 1:24:23.100
Miguel...

1:24:23.225 --> 1:24:24.434
Miguel!

1:26:18.256 --> 1:26:20.175
You don't know anything, man.

1:26:23.261 --> 1:26:26.306
You don't know how it is to kill someone
with your own hands.

1:26:27.766 --> 1:26:30.811
To hit someone on his face,
without stopping,

1:26:30.936 --> 1:26:33.939
knowing you're fucking up his brain.

1:26:38.694 --> 1:26:40.404
You don't know what it is...

1:26:41.613 --> 1:26:43.365
...to listen how the body
hits the canvas...

1:26:43.490 --> 1:26:46.159
and you know...

1:26:47.327 --> 1:26:49.496
you know he won't get back up.

1:26:51.206 --> 1:26:52.708
And he doesn't get up.

1:26:54.501 --> 1:26:57.462
You start thinking lots of things.

1:26:59.297 --> 1:27:01.591
You think about his wife...

1:27:05.554 --> 1:27:07.389
...his kids, man!

1:27:10.350 --> 1:27:13.019
His kids, man!

1:27:23.029 --> 1:27:24.823
And you know what's the worst part?

1:27:25.407 --> 1:27:27.826
The worst part is knowing that pain...

1:27:29.119 --> 1:27:31.288
...comes from you being a fucking fraud.

1:29:04.548 --> 1:29:05.590
Hey!

1:29:06.132 --> 1:29:07.384
<i>Hello.</i>

1:29:09.803 --> 1:29:11.012
It's me, your dad.

1:29:11.263 --> 1:29:13.890
<i>I know. I'm looking at you.</i>

1:29:14.099 --> 1:29:15.684
How are you, Yovis?

1:29:17.477 --> 1:29:19.020
It's snowing here, look.

1:29:23.900 --> 1:29:25.235
Can you see?

1:29:25.443 --> 1:29:27.112
<i>I can't see anything.</i>

1:29:36.913 --> 1:29:39.040
<i>You owe me 500 pesos.</i>

1:29:40.375 --> 1:29:41.501
Why?

1:29:46.631 --> 1:29:48.508
<i>I wanted you to win, Miguel.</i>

1:30:18.747 --> 1:30:20.248
Birthday boy.

1:30:20.665 --> 1:30:21.833
Hi!

1:30:22.626 --> 1:30:23.877
Happy birthday.

1:30:23.960 --> 1:30:25.337
Congratulations.

1:30:26.212 --> 1:30:27.714
Happy birthday.

1:30:27.797 --> 1:30:29.007
Thanks.

1:30:32.844 --> 1:30:33.929
Hi.

1:31:10.924 --> 1:31:13.259
Okay, who wants some cake?

1:31:16.513 --> 1:31:18.723
Isn't it nice? Thanks.

1:31:20.642 --> 1:31:22.477
Is this a bit slanted?

1:31:25.730 --> 1:31:27.482
I'm happy with it too.

1:31:27.857 --> 1:31:29.651
Did you make this yourself?

1:31:29.734 --> 1:31:32.654
Yes, I made it all by myself.

1:31:40.495 --> 1:31:43.248
So, the birthday boy is here.

1:31:44.374 --> 1:31:45.917
This is a bit, like...

1:31:47.335 --> 1:31:49.254
What cake is this?

1:31:50.380 --> 1:31:52.298
I think it's a chocolate cake.

1:31:52.465 --> 1:31:54.259
And are those nonpareils on top of it?

1:31:54.342 --> 1:31:55.385
Yeah.

1:31:55.468 --> 1:31:57.429
All the goodies.

1:31:57.512 --> 1:31:59.097
Here we go, birthday boy first.
