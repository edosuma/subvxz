- Hi.
- So,

07:46.675 --> 07:49.887
are you here
on business or pleasure?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.972
Uh, business, I'm afraid.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.683
We need information
on blue dragons.

07:54.725 --> 07:55.642
Hmm?

07:55.684 --> 07:57.227
Particularly,
how to kill them.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.021

I'll sell you

08:03.650 --> 08:05.944

[chuckles] We can't presently
afford such a weapon,

08:09.948 --> 08:13.577
but perhaps some advice
for a tiny fee?

08:13.660 --> 08:17.998
Hopefully what you're offering
isn't too tiny.

08:18.081 --> 08:21.460
I-I suppose size
isn't everything.

08:21.543 --> 08:24.671
We need to know if blue dragons
have any weaknesses.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.506
Weaknesses, eh?

08:26.590 --> 08:28.967
Well, to start,
they're egomaniacs.

08:29.051 --> 08:31.428
They hate being insulted
and have tremendous vanity.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.430
[chuckles] Not that
I can relate.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.515
- [both chuckle]
- Hi. Still here.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.100
Is there any way to stop them?

08:37.184 --> 08:40.771
Honestly, there's no simple way
to kill a dragon.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.773
Even in tomes of old,

08:42.856 --> 08:46.068
legends of their destruction
are largely poetic drivel.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.622

is a topic for many a scholar,

12:22.242 --> 12:25.412
Oh, shit. I bet Fince
is here to assassinate his ass.

12:25.495 --> 12:26.746
Oh, you think?

12:26.830 --> 12:28.415
Why don't you
three head to the second floor?

12:28.498 --> 12:29.916
Scanlan and Grog,
search the attic.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.544
- Vax and I will start here.
- [clicking]

12:32.627 --> 12:36.214
Or maybe we all
just go check the cellar.

12:42.471 --> 12:43.972
[Scanlan] Aha!

12:44.055 --> 12:46.641
We caught you blue-handed,
chicken humper!

12:46.725 --> 12:48.226
Drop your blade.

12:48.310 --> 12:51.021
What? No, no,
you don't understand.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.064
I'm not stealing anything.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.816
Of course you're not.
And that sword

12:54.900 --> 12:57.694
isn't to murder General Krieg
with, either, right?

12:57.777 --> 13:00.197
Pike, I think it is.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.658
You must listen to me.
These documents are evidence.

13:03.742 --> 13:07.454
General Krieg is planning to...
[shouts]

13:10.790 --> 13:12.042
[gasps]

13:14.419 --> 13:15.545
[Vex] What?

13:15.629 --> 13:17.339
- [Vex] Krieg!
- [Vax] Krieg!

13:17.422 --> 13:18.840
Nice bloody technique.

13:18.924 --> 13:20.800
How do you stay so quiet
in that armor?

13:20.884 --> 13:22.219
[high-pitched ringing]

13:22.302 --> 13:23.845
[exhales] Oh, no.

13:23.929 --> 13:25.138
[shouts]

13:26.765 --> 13:28.850
He's the one,
in league with the...

13:28.934 --> 13:30.393
Of course it was me.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.063
I championed you because
you're a bunch of witless oafs

13:33.146 --> 13:35.065
who no one gives
two shites about.

13:35.148 --> 13:39.236
You've been lucky so far,
but you have no idea

13:39.319 --> 13:42.030
what you have gotten
yourself into.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.366
I've got him.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.621
Finesse, huh?

13:52.541 --> 13:54.292
Krieg!

14:00.423 --> 14:01.675
He's gone.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.927
Quite the keen observation,
Scanlan.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.055
There must be a hidden exit
or trap door.

14:07.138 --> 14:08.431
Fan out.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.183
Look for some kind of fulcrum.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.310
Wait, a fuck room?

14:12.394 --> 14:13.853
I mean, that's what I heard.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.105
A lever, a button.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.440
Just... stand over there, Grog,

14:17.524 --> 14:19.734
and don't touch anything.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.280
Whoa.

14:23.363 --> 14:27.075
You guys, everything
in this room is magical.

14:27.158 --> 14:29.160
Where do we even start?

14:30.161 --> 14:31.079
Oh. [gasps]

14:31.162 --> 14:32.205
Oh, my.

14:32.289 --> 14:36.126
Oh, how booty-ful. [gasps]

14:36.209 --> 14:39.254
This guy really has a thing
for dragons.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.840
[Grog chuckling]

14:43.216 --> 14:46.136
Grog, it's rude to stare.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.179
- Grog, you're being gross.
- [chuckling]

14:48.263 --> 14:49.514
[grunting]

14:50.390 --> 14:52.100
Oh! Keyleth, you found it!

14:52.183 --> 14:53.226
It's a portal!

14:53.310 --> 14:55.437
[exhales] Nice work.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.605
Brilliant, really.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.815
[chuckles] Oh. It was nothing.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.900
She threw a book at a head.
It was nothing.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.736
[gasps]

15:02.819 --> 15:04.654
My arms. Scanlan, lookit!

15:04.738 --> 15:07.073
[gasps] They're in the booty.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.367
That is so cool.

15:09.451 --> 15:11.578
Listen,
if we're gonna fight Krieg,

15:11.661 --> 15:13.747
we have to do this as a team,
all right?

15:13.830 --> 15:15.665
Organized. As one.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.667
Please, we... [chuckles]
We don't do organized.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.669
Look at us.
We're Vox Machina.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.463
We fuck shit up.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.214
Can we at least try?

15:23.298 --> 15:25.300
Can we at least go, already?

15:25.383 --> 15:27.469
Lead the way, big man.

15:27.552 --> 15:28.970
[groans]

15:31.056 --> 15:32.807
You know what, guys,
uh, good luck.

15:32.891 --> 15:35.310
I'm just gonna keep a lookout
from here. [shouts]

15:39.397 --> 15:40.732
- [shouts]
- [shivering]

15:40.815 --> 15:42.067
So cold.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.777
What is this place?

15:43.860 --> 15:46.112
High in the mountains, I'd say.

15:48.490 --> 15:49.741
[Vax] Wherever we are,

15:49.824 --> 15:51.910
we're far from Emon.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.915
[Scanlan] No way.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.500
- [shivering] Gold.
- [gasping]

15:58.583 --> 16:00.335
- Gold. [laughing] Gold!
- [Grog laughing]

16:00.418 --> 16:02.253
Seems excessive
for a council member.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.214
Seems excessive for anyone.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.757
- [Grog] Yeah!
- [chuckling]

16:07.592 --> 16:08.510
[grunts]

16:08.593 --> 16:10.929
Magic scrolls, jewels, potions.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.597
Is this a troll dick?

16:12.681 --> 16:15.016
Think of all the ale
I could buy.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.519
Buddy, we could be drunk
for weeks.

16:17.602 --> 16:18.937
Days, even!

16:19.020 --> 16:22.023
You know what, Uriel can keep
his paltry payment.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.608
We're rich!

16:23.692 --> 16:25.527
Wait. Wait, wait, wait!

16:25.610 --> 16:28.029
This gold didn't fall out
of the fucking sky.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.572
This is a horde!

16:29.656 --> 16:31.866
- We're in the dragon's lair!
- [grunts]

16:32.951 --> 16:34.285
Those are pretty.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.954
But also...

16:36.037 --> 16:38.123
ominous.

16:40.792 --> 16:41.543
[gasps]

16:41.626 --> 16:44.587
[otherworldly voice] Intruders.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.006
[rumbling]

16:47.090 --> 16:48.925
I didn't do that.
Did I do that?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.176
I don't think I did that.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.261
[groans]

16:52.303 --> 16:53.388
[Krieg] I must say,

16:53.471 --> 16:55.390
I'm impressed.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.642
To tell you the truth,
I was certain

16:57.726 --> 17:01.980
you would die the moment
you met the mighty Brimscythe.

17:02.063 --> 17:06.401
But it seems some vermin
are harder to kill than others.

17:06.484 --> 17:10.488
You-you wanted Uriel to send
the entire army out of Emon.

17:10.572 --> 17:13.283
So your dragon friend
could wipe them out.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.786
The Age of Man
is coming to an end.

17:16.870 --> 17:20.957
There was a time when dragons
ruled all of Tal'Dorei,

17:21.040 --> 17:24.919
when we ruled the entire world.

17:25.003 --> 17:26.504
Did he just say "we"?

17:26.588 --> 17:28.590
[growling]

17:36.222 --> 17:37.432
[roars]

17:37.515 --> 17:39.601
Didn't see this one coming,
did you, Vex?

17:39.684 --> 17:41.519
[growling]

17:52.947 --> 17:54.783
- [screams]
- Grog!

17:54.866 --> 17:56.326
[grunts, groans]

17:56.409 --> 17:59.078
- Are you all right?
- Um, no.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.122
- [Brimscythe roaring]
- [all screaming]

18:05.794 --> 18:07.545
A tickle.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.756
Let me return the favor.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.717
Shit. [exclaims]

18:12.801 --> 18:14.010
Aah!

18:15.220 --> 18:17.347
[grunts]

18:18.807 --> 18:22.602
Fools. I'll devour you all.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.145
Huh?

18:24.229 --> 18:26.022
[sniffs, growls]

18:29.442 --> 18:31.236
Pike? Pike?

18:31.319 --> 18:33.112
Pike? Pike?! Pike?!

18:33.196 --> 18:35.031
- [screams]
- [grunting]

18:40.078 --> 18:41.996
[both grunt]

18:45.667 --> 18:48.044
- Look out!
- [grunts]

18:48.127 --> 18:50.380
Vax, did Gilmore
give you any insight

18:50.463 --> 18:51.840
on how to kill this thing,

18:51.923 --> 18:53.925
or did you two flirt
the whole time?

18:54.008 --> 18:55.426
Shit. Right, right.

18:55.510 --> 18:58.263
Uh, uh,
dragons are vain, arrogant,

18:58.346 --> 18:59.973
- egotistical... [grunts]
- [growling]

19:00.056 --> 19:02.517
[Vex] I know that already.
I studied them, remember?

19:05.019 --> 19:06.729
- [grunts]
- Doesn't matter.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.107
We can't do shit
if it's in the air.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.154
[Vax] "Where
the twin rivers meet."

19:15.238 --> 19:16.990
The neck. You see that?

19:17.073 --> 19:18.825
We have to get it on the ground.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.410
Vex, do you hear me?!

19:20.493 --> 19:23.288
Yes! This way. I've got a plan.

19:23.371 --> 19:26.082
- Aw, another one?
- Shut up.

19:27.667 --> 19:28.877
[gasps]

19:28.960 --> 19:31.045
Look, okay,
for once, you were right.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.006
Maybe we don't fight as one.

19:33.089 --> 19:35.633
Maybe we do what we do best.

19:35.717 --> 19:39.012
What? We have no best.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.763
[Brimscythe cackles]

19:40.847 --> 19:42.724
So, what do you want us to do?
Run out and yell,

19:42.807 --> 19:46.561
"Hey, dragon man, we don't know
what the fuck we're doing"?

19:49.814 --> 19:51.566
[growls]
Ha!

19:51.649 --> 19:55.194
You think you can
hide in my lair?

19:57.071 --> 19:58.823
Hey, taint smear!

19:58.907 --> 20:00.658
You're in my way again, you ape.

20:00.742 --> 20:02.160
What'd you call me?

20:02.243 --> 20:04.037
Maybe I'll squash you, too.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.831
Oh, as if either of you
could kill anything.

20:06.915 --> 20:09.876
A preening, peacoated peacock
and a witless goon.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.461
[Percy] You watch yourself,
peasant.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.713
If the three of you
will shut up already

20:13.796 --> 20:15.673
and let me kill
this inflated windbag...

20:15.757 --> 20:18.176
[growls]
Kill me?

20:18.259 --> 20:21.095
I am the iron storm.

20:21.179 --> 20:23.473
You are nothing but insects!

20:24.515 --> 20:26.225
[all scream]

20:29.187 --> 20:32.565
[laughs]
Pathetic.

20:40.198 --> 20:42.200
[Brimscythe] What?

20:43.576 --> 20:46.746
- Impossible!
- [Scanlan clears throat]

20:46.829 --> 20:48.623
- Gotcha.
- Now!

20:48.706 --> 20:50.416
[Keyleth] Oh, come on.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.585
Come on, come on, come on.
You got this.

20:52.669 --> 20:54.128
[grunts]

20:54.212 --> 20:57.006
[panting, grunts]

20:59.509 --> 21:01.886
[roars]

21:04.889 --> 21:07.600
[panting]

21:07.684 --> 21:09.686
[grunting]

21:19.654 --> 21:21.239
Scanlan's Hand!

21:22.281 --> 21:24.283
[grunting]

21:27.745 --> 21:29.455
[roaring]

21:34.544 --> 21:36.546
Light him up, Vex.

21:43.845 --> 21:45.847
[screams]

21:47.098 --> 21:50.101
I will sunder your bones.

21:50.184 --> 21:53.021
- Look who's nice and low.
- [sneers]

21:53.104 --> 21:57.650
I would like to...

21:57.734 --> 22:02.947
rage!

22:03.031 --> 22:05.241
[roaring]

22:05.324 --> 22:07.618
[shouting]

22:15.460 --> 22:17.253
[all grunt]

22:21.549 --> 22:23.801
[Grog groans]

22:23.885 --> 22:25.887
Is he dead?

22:25.970 --> 22:28.347
[Chuckles softly]
We did that.

22:28.431 --> 22:29.807
We did that, right?

22:29.891 --> 22:32.810
It seems being a bunch
of assholes has its merits.

22:32.894 --> 22:34.562
[Grog grunts]

22:34.645 --> 22:35.938
- Souvenir?
- [scoffs]

22:36.022 --> 22:38.399
Proof we killed the scaly turd.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.985
Huh. You know,
you're a lot smarter

22:41.069 --> 22:42.737
than we give you credit for,
Grog.

22:42.820 --> 22:45.448
- Yep, I'm a genius.
- Huh?

22:49.243 --> 22:50.995
- Aw, fuck this day.
- Oh!

22:52.789 --> 22:55.833
- Exit strategy?
- Run!

23:01.464 --> 23:02.465
[Scanlan] Wait!

23:02.548 --> 23:04.759
The-the loot!
[grunts]

23:04.842 --> 23:08.179
[groans]
Damn it!

23:13.434 --> 23:15.394
We got him, kid.

23:22.193 --> 23:23.778
[Uriel] Vox Machina,

23:23.861 --> 23:26.864
for your selfless heroism,
I proclaim you all

23:26.948 --> 23:28.324
Protectors of the Realm

23:28.407 --> 23:30.535
and honorary members

23:30.618 --> 23:33.079
of the council of Tal'Dorei.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.498
I know.
I can hardly believe it myself.

23:35.581 --> 23:36.874
[all laugh]

23:36.958 --> 23:39.127
Oh, how I've missed
respectability.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.379
Yes, yes, yes,
that's all fine and good,

23:41.462 --> 23:43.422
but where is the... Ah.

23:43.506 --> 23:44.799
There we are.

23:44.882 --> 23:47.677
[chuckles]
Payday.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.011
Uh...

23:49.095 --> 23:50.721
Keys? Parchment?

23:50.805 --> 23:53.850
- Where's our reward?
- [Uriel] You're holding it.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.227
The deed to your new keep
here in Emon.

23:56.310 --> 23:59.063
We need our protectors
close at hand to,

23:59.147 --> 24:00.565
you know, protect.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.775
- [gasps, chuckles]
- [chuckles]

24:02.859 --> 24:05.945
Uh-huh. Uh, hypothetically,
if we sold it, how much

24:06.028 --> 24:07.238
do you think that...

24:07.321 --> 24:08.656
Okay.

24:08.739 --> 24:12.118
Sister, we have a home.

24:14.328 --> 24:16.122
Wait till I tell my father.

24:16.205 --> 24:18.499
Oh, the Ashari
will never believe this.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.042
I bet...

24:20.126 --> 24:23.462
I'm ruining a moment right now,
aren't I?

24:23.546 --> 24:26.424
Yep, I'm just gonna
go over here now.

24:26.507 --> 24:28.551
As protectors,
you must understand

24:28.634 --> 24:30.720
that the threat
is far from over.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.514
We suspect Krieg may have been
part of a larger plot.

24:33.598 --> 24:36.267
As such, I have arranged
an important banquet

24:36.350 --> 24:38.644
to discuss the security
of our realm.

24:38.728 --> 24:40.396
It'll be quite delightful,
really.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.023
We have a wonderful cook.

24:42.106 --> 24:45.359
We trust you will all attend.
In fact,

24:45.443 --> 24:48.696
several dignitaries should be
on their way as we speak.

24:51.949 --> 24:53.910
- [horse neighs]
- Huh?

24:56.954 --> 25:00.583
L-Lady Briarwood, there's
something blocking the road.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.211
Can you go around it, Desmond?

25:03.294 --> 25:05.922
[man] Allow me, my love.

[bandit] Well,
ain't this a lucky night.

25:20.978 --> 25:22.521
Looks like royalty to me.

25:22.605 --> 25:25.024
What do you say, gang?

25:25.107 --> 25:27.276
[whimpers]

25:27.360 --> 25:30.404
Oh, he's a fancy one.

25:30.488 --> 25:33.074
We want everything
you and the missus got

25:33.157 --> 25:35.201
unless you want to be gutted
like a fish.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.203
What, are you deaf or something?

25:37.286 --> 25:38.496
Empty your pockets.

25:38.579 --> 25:39.622
Aah!

25:39.705 --> 25:41.916
[gasping]

25:43.960 --> 25:45.086
The fuck?!

[door opens]

25:54.929 --> 25:57.098
I hope it wasn't
too much trouble, Sylas.

25:57.181 --> 25:58.849
Delilah, my dear,

25:58.933 --> 26:02.103
- it was nothing.
