00:01.101 --> 00:02.969
<i>Previously, on "Being Mary Jane..."</i>

00:03.036 --> 00:06.773
The client that owns this place,
she's really taken me under her wing.

00:07.107 --> 00:08.675
I'm not trying to mess that up.

00:08.742 --> 00:12.078
You got people looking out for you?
I like it. That's important.

00:12.145 --> 00:14.681
What do you think about us
getting our own place?

00:14.748 --> 00:17.150
How will we pay for it?
You got a job you haven't told me about?

00:17.217 --> 00:18.718
You got that settlement check coming.

00:18.785 --> 00:21.287
I told you I was going to put that
in a trust for Treyvion

00:21.354 --> 00:22.856
and for your daughter, Isabel.

00:22.922 --> 00:25.792
Your mom wanted me to get sure
you got in okay. How's everything?

00:25.859 --> 00:29.295
I'm not Ava. I'm Kristie. This is Ava.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.599
- Hey, Paul.
- Hi.

00:32.665 --> 00:35.435
Mom didn't tell me
my babysitter would be so cute.

00:37.237 --> 00:38.571
How much is this one?

00:38.638 --> 00:41.574
After taxes, fully loaded, 45,000.

00:43.576 --> 00:44.644
I'll take it.

00:46.246 --> 00:47.514
Hey!

00:51.050 --> 00:52.018
VIP.

01:16.709 --> 01:19.946
My God. Niecy, this VIP is everything!

01:20.013 --> 01:21.448
Look at all of this!

01:22.148 --> 01:25.351
This don't cost a groove.
What's the occasion?

01:25.418 --> 01:28.321
Well, seeing that we are
all single mothers,

01:28.388 --> 01:30.857
doing it for our kids, struggling,

01:30.924 --> 01:33.293
I figured we needed a night out.

01:33.359 --> 01:35.595
We made it through a tough year,

01:36.529 --> 01:40.900
so tonight is my treat. Okay? All right?

01:41.801 --> 01:44.804
All right? Now put your glass over.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.573
- To my gals.
- All right!

01:52.278 --> 01:54.948
Niecy! Girl, don't look now.

01:55.014 --> 01:59.486
but there is a fine gentleman
eyeing you up and down, girl.

01:59.552 --> 02:01.955
The one looking like
Morris Chestnut's twin?

02:02.288 --> 02:04.691
- Cute. Not interested.
- What?

02:04.757 --> 02:08.194
Are you crazy? Do you have a fever?

02:08.261 --> 02:12.198
No. I'm just focused on Dante right now.
He's been making a real effort.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.634
He's been there for the kids.
Both of them.

02:14.701 --> 02:18.137
I think he's really starting to fall
in love with them now that they're older.

02:18.838 --> 02:20.206
You're serious?

02:20.273 --> 02:23.910
- Like, Dante?
- Yes. We're even looking at houses.

02:23.977 --> 02:27.647
Niecy, I don't mean to burst your bubble,
but you are a fool.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.682
- Kiki! Don't...
- No, I'm fine.

02:29.749 --> 02:34.287
Nobody said nothing to you when you were
chasing behind Dietrich-no-good ass.

02:34.354 --> 02:38.391
I'm just saying!
Everything Dante put you through...

02:38.458 --> 02:41.694
Okay? Don't forget it just 'cause
he's acting brand new all of a sudden.

02:41.761 --> 02:44.130
You act like people
don't grow and mature.

02:44.664 --> 02:47.534
You know? Dante really wants a family
and I do too.

02:47.600 --> 02:51.905
I mean, if that's what you want,
then that's all we want.

02:51.971 --> 02:53.907
Yeah, better be.
I'm paying for this bottle.

02:54.741 --> 02:58.511
Now, here we go.
Some hooka for my hot girls.

03:03.249 --> 03:07.086
How can you eat a rack of baby backs
and still be this grumpy?

03:07.153 --> 03:09.355
'Cause we're missing
Dad's Superbowl ribs fest.

03:09.422 --> 03:11.925
You realize we were too busy
for his ribs last year, right?

03:12.258 --> 03:14.994
I know, but when it was right there,
we took it for granted.

03:15.695 --> 03:16.729
Okay.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.232
So? What d'you think?

03:19.966 --> 03:22.702
These are good.
Not as good as Dad's, though.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.070
- I'm saying it.
- I know.

03:24.137 --> 03:27.740
How in a city of eight million people
cannot one person make good ribs?

03:28.241 --> 03:31.044
You're being way too dramatic
right now, okay? What's going on?

03:32.545 --> 03:33.780
Winter.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.415
Drying out my weave,

03:35.481 --> 03:37.216
and getting up at 3 a.m. every morning

03:37.283 --> 03:39.252
to swim with the sharks
of "Great Day USA"

03:39.319 --> 03:40.853
is positively exhausting.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.690
And Lee... He's is on tour in the Midwest

03:43.756 --> 03:45.491
and I'm really lonely.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.727
You just said
there are eight million people in NYC.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.062
How are you feeling lonely?

03:49.128 --> 03:50.763
I don't know. I just am.

03:51.264 --> 03:54.467
Well, here's an idea.
Why don't you take your butt home?

03:54.534 --> 03:55.969
Go home for a week.

03:56.035 --> 03:58.571
I can't. I'm the on-call correspondent.

03:58.905 --> 04:03.476
So I gotta stay close to the studio
in case of any breaking news or whatever.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.012
Don't you ever miss Atlanta?

04:06.079 --> 04:08.214
Why would I wanna go back
to the place where I was

04:08.281 --> 04:10.316
twirling signs and selling weed?

04:10.650 --> 04:13.953
Right. I'm straight up here
tonight in New York. And so are you.

04:14.721 --> 04:17.290
You'd better relax.
Enjoy this. Seriously.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.125
Yeah, I know.

04:19.192 --> 04:22.962
I heard of this really good spot
in New Jersey. Let's give it a go.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.131
I think I have a better idea.

04:29.502 --> 04:32.071
Letta, this is
a thousand dollar a night hotel.

04:32.138 --> 04:34.007
Where do you plan on putting this smoker?

04:34.073 --> 04:35.508
Right outside, on the terrace.

04:36.576 --> 04:38.111
Put this down for a second, okay?

04:39.212 --> 04:40.213
What?

04:43.082 --> 04:44.350
No.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.687
Look, why don't we take this back
to my real state office?

04:47.754 --> 04:49.756
We've got a really dope patio
on the rooftop.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.824
And rock the boat
with your mentor Olivia?

04:51.891 --> 04:55.094
- You don't have to worry about that.
- So, everything's good between you guys?

04:55.161 --> 04:57.296
Cool. Yeah.
He's helped me out tremendously.

04:57.597 --> 05:01.100
Which reminds me I have a favor to ask.

05:01.734 --> 05:04.704
Olivia's daughter is graduating
from Journalism School

05:04.771 --> 05:06.406
and she really wants an internship.

05:07.306 --> 05:10.243
"Great Day USA's" program
is one of the most coveted

05:10.309 --> 05:11.944
in all of morning news.

05:12.011 --> 05:14.480
There's like a thousand applicants
for 15 slots.

05:14.547 --> 05:17.350
I know. But can you at least
get her an interview?

05:17.417 --> 05:18.851
This reeks of nepotism.

05:18.918 --> 05:21.287
But Olivia's gone above
and beyond for me.

05:21.354 --> 05:24.991
I mean, is it too much to ask
for my big sister to do the same?

05:25.058 --> 05:26.526
No, it's not.

05:27.093 --> 05:30.263
- I will put in the request. No promises.
- That's all I ask.

05:30.329 --> 05:31.998
Now help me get this outside. Come on.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.836
This is the life. You hear me?

05:36.903 --> 05:38.404
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

05:38.705 --> 05:42.909
Yeah! I mean, getting pinned down
by that cop wasn't fine

05:42.975 --> 05:45.178
but this show makes up for it.

05:46.979 --> 05:50.650
Hi, girl! I like your wig!

05:50.717 --> 05:53.753
Looks like you're having fun.
D'ya mind if we join you?

05:53.820 --> 05:55.922
I'm sorry, it's a private celebration.

05:56.889 --> 05:59.959
You think you got here 'cause
you have a few dollars to throw around?

06:00.026 --> 06:02.762
- Excuse me?
- I recognize you.

06:02.829 --> 06:06.933
You're the girl that got tased
by the police. We've all seen you.

06:07.600 --> 06:12.138
You got two kids by two baby daddies.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.073
Ain't that right?

06:14.674 --> 06:17.610
Hey, babe.
You can flash all the cash you want.

06:18.010 --> 06:20.179
You still ain't nothing but a hoe.

06:20.613 --> 06:21.614
Hold it.

06:22.482 --> 06:26.018
First of all,
I didn't start this conversation.

06:26.452 --> 06:29.989
You came over here thirsty
trying to sit in my VIP.

06:30.790 --> 06:31.858
Okay?

06:32.158 --> 06:33.626
So get out of my face

06:34.026 --> 06:37.029
and let me and my friends
enjoy our booth. Bye!

06:37.096 --> 06:38.464
Get away, asshole!

06:38.531 --> 06:40.233
Yeah, takes more to know, right, bitch?

06:42.535 --> 06:44.437
- Let me go!
- I'll beat your ass!

06:46.906 --> 06:48.374
Bald headed asshole!

06:48.441 --> 06:50.042
I'm gonna kill you!

06:50.109 --> 06:51.744
You should value your life, bitch!

06:51.811 --> 06:53.045
Hoe!

06:54.914 --> 06:57.950
Get off of me! Get off of me!

06:59.285 --> 07:02.855
Why am I being kicked out?
She started it. Ratched ass bitch!

07:02.922 --> 07:04.891
I'll beat your ass!
Go home with your kids!

07:04.957 --> 07:07.527
You're ratcheted! You're a hater!
I've got my money!

07:07.593 --> 07:08.795
Just look at you, hoe!

07:15.067 --> 07:17.303
They are staring at you, whore!

08:06.519 --> 08:07.620
Mom!

08:08.321 --> 08:11.490
- What is it, baby?
- I can't find my red "broom broom."

08:11.791 --> 08:14.360
- Did you leave it at Dante's?
- I gotta go get it.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.197
Listen, Dante is at work, babe.

08:18.264 --> 08:19.465
But I want it now.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.968
What did I just say?
Didn't I tell you that he's at work?

08:22.034 --> 08:23.669
I promise we will go get it later.

08:24.070 --> 08:26.072
No, mom. Right now!

08:29.075 --> 08:33.012
No, no...

08:33.312 --> 08:35.181
No, Mom. Right now!

08:37.683 --> 08:38.784
Come on.

08:40.586 --> 08:46.259
Deja, our family has been a member
of this wonderful organization for years.

08:47.226 --> 08:51.130
Me, my mother, and Mary Jane
we are all members.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.966
So, you know what that means?

08:54.033 --> 08:57.370
- That means I'm gonna be a member too?
- That's right.

08:57.436 --> 09:01.107
You're gonna be the fourth generation
in the Pattersons family

09:01.173 --> 09:02.909
to carry on the tradition.

09:02.975 --> 09:06.512
You're gonna learn our culture
and you're gonna grow up

09:06.812 --> 09:11.183
to be the proud black woman
that you're meant to be.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.853
- That sounds cool.
- It is cool.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.455
And you see those girls over there?

09:17.490 --> 09:18.691
Go mingle with them.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.297
- Hi, I'm Deja.
- We know.

09:24.964 --> 09:28.267
You're Niecy Patterson's sister, right?

09:34.206 --> 09:36.776
I didn't expect to see you here
today, Helen.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.711
And hello to you too, Joan.

09:39.145 --> 09:42.181
Why would I not show up for Deja's mixer?

09:43.049 --> 09:46.385
Well, I thought you'd be tending
to your granddaughter, Niecy.

09:46.452 --> 09:49.455
And why would I be
tending to my granddaughter?

09:50.489 --> 09:52.525
- You haven't heard.
- Heard what?

09:53.926 --> 09:55.728
Esme, would you please come here?

09:59.665 --> 10:02.234
Please, show Mrs. Patterson
what you showed me.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.277
<i>- Get away, hoe.
- It takes one to know one, right, bitch?</i>

10:11.577 --> 10:14.680
<i>- Let me go!
- I'll beat your ass!</i>

10:15.848 --> 10:17.416
<i>Remember that, bitch!</i>

10:26.625 --> 10:29.528
For the record,
I think this is a bad idea.

10:29.895 --> 10:31.530
I mean, what if we burn the hotel down?

10:32.131 --> 10:35.401
It's a smoker.
There's smoke, PJ, not fire.

10:35.735 --> 10:37.636
Put that away. We gotta make the sauce.

10:37.703 --> 10:42.108
Well, just in case,
I would love to document this.

10:42.174 --> 10:43.242
Sure.

10:43.309 --> 10:47.046
- Hey. Wait, hold that.
- What?

10:47.780 --> 10:50.149
Niece's Twitter page. Did you see this?

10:54.420 --> 10:55.821
"Why the bitch got tased."

11:01.660 --> 11:02.895
Niecy...

11:03.462 --> 11:04.597
What's wrong, Grandma?

11:05.564 --> 11:07.633
Were you in a fight last night?

11:09.468 --> 11:11.937
Yes, I was in a fight last night.

11:12.004 --> 11:15.307
- Who even told you that?
- The ladies from "Jack and Jane."

11:15.374 --> 11:17.209
Listen, Grandma.
I can explain everything.

11:17.276 --> 11:21.447
I'll not tolerate this kind of behavior
while you're living under my roof.

11:22.348 --> 11:28.020
Baby girl, your behavior has consequences
for the entire family.

11:28.087 --> 11:31.457
Those bushy ladies have their hackles
out for me, and you are embarrassed?

11:31.524 --> 11:35.394
For the past year, your father,
grandfather and I

11:35.461 --> 11:39.465
have endured whispers and comments
from the entire community.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.800
And so have I!

11:41.133 --> 11:43.235
You act like I asked to get tased, Grandma.

11:45.538 --> 11:50.276
Truth be told, Niecy,
I had hoped and prayed

11:50.976 --> 11:53.646
that this would be a wake-up call for you

11:53.712 --> 11:56.415
and that you would start acting
more maturely.

11:57.483 --> 12:02.788
Sadly, you have proved it not to be so.

12:17.837 --> 12:19.872
I texted you like ten times.

12:19.939 --> 12:23.042
With my bosses I gotta keep my phone off.
I just got your text.

12:24.610 --> 12:27.980
You need to chill, girl.
Wanna come to work and ask for yourself?

12:28.047 --> 12:30.316
No, I wanted to tell you
what happened last night.

12:30.716 --> 12:31.784
What do you mean?

12:32.251 --> 12:34.620
I got into a fight with some girl.

12:34.687 --> 12:37.022
And my grandmother found out
and freaked out on me.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.792
Sorry about that, Niecy,
but I can't deal right now.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.528
I mean, so, when will we hang out?

12:43.496 --> 12:45.965
Isabel's asking for you
and so is Treyvion.

12:46.031 --> 12:49.235
Soon. But I really need
to get some sleep. I'll call you later.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.311
Are you Niecy Patterson?

13:00.346 --> 13:01.647
Yeah. Who are you?

13:05.818 --> 13:08.521
- What the hell is this?
- Niecy Patterson, you've been served.

13:10.422 --> 13:11.690
What?

13:13.959 --> 13:16.829
It says I have to appear in Court
for violating my settlement agreement.

13:17.263 --> 13:19.231
Does it have something to do
with the fight?

13:19.298 --> 13:20.699
Niecy...

13:20.766 --> 13:22.568
This girl...
She came up to me in the club.

13:22.835 --> 13:25.504
She said I was trash
and that I was flaunting my money.

13:26.872 --> 13:28.908
We exchanged words
and she took a swipe at me.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.610
I mean, what was I supposed
to do? I had to defend myself.

13:32.278 --> 13:35.381
Wait. How did Fulton County
found out about this?

13:35.447 --> 13:37.049
- Were you arrested?
- No.

13:38.184 --> 13:41.520
I guess people at the club took videos
and posted them on Twitter.

13:41.587 --> 13:44.390
Yeah, but fighting's not a violation
of the agreement.

13:44.456 --> 13:46.192
So what does this have to do
with the settlement?

13:46.258 --> 13:48.627
When people saw the video,
everybody had something to say.

13:48.694 --> 13:51.163
Black people, racist white people...

13:52.231 --> 13:54.767
I mean, they used the hashtag
"Why the bitch got tased."

13:54.833 --> 13:57.203
Let me guess. You had to clap back.

13:57.269 --> 13:59.772
They're trying to say that
the only reason why I got paid

13:59.838 --> 14:02.408
was for that bigot cop
to go back to work.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.009
Niecy, your lawyer went over this.

14:04.076 --> 14:07.146
You're not allowed to talk about
any of that in public. You know that.

14:07.580 --> 14:12.484
But she can go to her lawyer
and tell her side of it, right, Paul?

14:12.551 --> 14:14.553
Settlement agreements
are pretty standard.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.822
No talk means no talk.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.227
I never meant for any of this to happen.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.163
I'll call the lawyer
and see what can be done.

14:24.597 --> 14:25.798
No.

14:26.332 --> 14:29.201
I got this. I'll call him myself.

14:41.413 --> 14:44.350
Joan, so good to have seen you earlier.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.353
Deja is so excited.

14:47.419 --> 14:50.856
She's gonna be
just a fantastic addition to the group.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.826
<i>That's why I'm calling. It's about Deja.</i>

14:54.660 --> 14:57.830
<i>Regretfully, I won't be able
to endorse her initiation.</i>

14:58.097 --> 14:59.331
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

14:59.398 --> 15:03.736
You've endorsed three of my children
over the years. So...

15:04.570 --> 15:06.839
Why not my granddaughter?

15:06.905 --> 15:09.308
<i>I tried to warm you about this
at the mixer,</i>

15:09.375 --> 15:11.210
<i>but clearly you weren't listening.</i>

15:11.277 --> 15:15.714
<i>Given Nicey's very public
and very violent behavior,</i>

15:15.781 --> 15:17.483
<i>it's left me with no choice.</i>

15:17.549 --> 15:22.054
Niecy is not a member
of the organization. I am.

15:22.121 --> 15:23.322
<i>Exactly.</i>

15:23.389 --> 15:26.158
<i>Considering Patrick's
troubles with drugs,</i>

15:26.225 --> 15:28.894
<i>and now Niecy
becoming as troubled as he is,</i>

15:28.961 --> 15:31.163
<i>I mean, could Deja be next?</i>

15:31.230 --> 15:34.566
Deja Patterson is an exemplary student,

15:35.100 --> 15:39.204
classroom leader,
volunteer at Sunday school.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.373
She would be perfect for "Jack and Jane."

15:41.740 --> 15:42.875
<i>That may be true.</i>

15:42.941 --> 15:47.646
<i>But given who her father and sister are,
"Jack and Jane" has got to be careful.</i>

15:47.980 --> 15:49.748
<i>If we let Deja in,</i>

15:50.249 --> 15:53.886
<i>what kind of message
would that send to the members?</i>

15:56.522 --> 15:58.757
Hey, I got everything, baby.
I got all set.

15:58.824 --> 16:02.695
Got the collard greens, the ribs...
All the fixings.

16:08.867 --> 16:11.937
Babe, you all right?

16:12.538 --> 16:14.606
It's all happening again, Paul.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.775
What? What's happening?

16:17.076 --> 16:19.745
The judgment, the looks, all of it!

16:20.012 --> 16:21.880
I just talked to Joan.

16:22.514 --> 16:25.651
And she doesn't want Deja
to be initiated.

16:26.452 --> 16:29.154
Is "Jack and Jane" really
that important to you, Helen?

16:29.488 --> 16:30.789
Yes, Paul!

16:31.323 --> 16:33.659
When I joined, it was about

16:34.993 --> 16:37.696
assimilating into the white world.

16:38.130 --> 16:42.768
But now, it's about identity.
Our identity.

16:43.602 --> 16:45.571
Being proud of being black.

16:46.538 --> 16:50.476
I've watched you put on that smiling face
for over a year now.

16:50.542 --> 16:53.245
And you're still hearing whispers
behind your back.

16:53.712 --> 16:57.916
Look, I don't agree with what Niecy said
or how she said it.

16:59.651 --> 17:01.320
There are gonna be repercussions.

17:01.787 --> 17:04.823
But at least, now everybody knows
exactly how she feels.

17:10.095 --> 17:11.196
Okay.

17:13.132 --> 17:14.333
You're right.

17:17.503 --> 17:18.537
I love you.

17:27.413 --> 17:28.647
What did the lawyer say?

17:28.914 --> 17:32.751
He said that I violated
the settlement agreement with Atlanta PD,

17:33.886 --> 17:35.921
and that the hearing is just a formality.

17:37.356 --> 17:38.857
That I have to give the money back.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.661
The lawyer fees and taxes too?

17:42.728 --> 17:45.664
No, thank God. Just my portion.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.500
- That can't possibly be true.
- It is.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.403
I gotta give back
the whole 150,000 dollars.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.706
Come on, come here and sit down.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.777
All right. It's gonna be alright, okay?

17:59.311 --> 18:02.114
Just 'cause I'm disappointed
doesn't mean I'm not here for you.

18:02.614 --> 18:04.016
That goes for us all.

18:05.617 --> 18:09.021
We're family.
We must stick together, no matter what.

18:09.087 --> 18:12.291
Yeah. It's not the end of the world.

18:12.591 --> 18:17.196
Okay? We'll just get the money
out of the trust and return it.

18:22.901 --> 18:24.470
There's a slight problem in there.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.073
I never got around the settlement
on the trust.

18:28.140 --> 18:30.709
What do you mean
you never got around to it?

18:30.776 --> 18:32.377
I was going to, I just...

18:34.746 --> 18:36.114
Where's the money, Niecy?

18:38.250 --> 18:40.786
I know you bought new clothes
for you and the kids...

18:40.853 --> 18:44.256
And you've been keeping up your weave
and your nails regularly, but...

18:44.323 --> 18:46.291
That's not 150,000 dollars.

18:46.358 --> 18:48.727
Well, I put out a deposit
on a breast lift.

18:51.129 --> 18:52.598
I loaned my girls some money.

18:54.566 --> 18:57.536
That doesn't account for all
the money, Niecy. Where's the rest?

18:59.371 --> 19:00.639
Answer your father.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.210
I bought Dante a car.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.613
Good Lord! Now I've heard it all.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.781
You bought that deadbeat a car?

19:09.848 --> 19:11.083
He's been trying.

19:11.950 --> 19:15.654
He's been there for me,
Isabel and Treyvion.

19:15.721 --> 19:18.657
Yeah, right. And now that he has the car,
he's still been trying?

19:20.192 --> 19:21.326
No. I'll ask you again.

19:21.393 --> 19:23.562
Has Dante been hanging
around now that he has the car?

19:25.731 --> 19:27.232
Exactly. That's what I thought.

19:27.299 --> 19:28.834
We're gonna take that car back.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.637
I'm driving you there myself
to make sure that happens.

19:31.703 --> 19:32.905
You don't have to do that.

19:32.971 --> 19:35.374
With everything that's been going down,
clearly I do!

19:35.641 --> 19:36.875
Come on! Let's go!

19:44.316 --> 19:45.317
So?

19:46.251 --> 19:47.486
It's too sweet.

19:47.953 --> 19:49.855
Too much maple syrup or something.

19:50.322 --> 19:52.057
This is the fifth batch we've made.

19:52.124 --> 19:55.360
I know. But it's just not like...
It's not like Dad's.

19:55.994 --> 19:57.696
I don't know what we're doing wrong.

20:01.099 --> 20:04.403
It's Niecy. She says Patrick's having
a meltdown

20:04.469 --> 20:06.438
about her buying Dante the car.

20:09.274 --> 20:10.576
No, I'm not here.

20:12.244 --> 20:13.312
Hey, brother!

20:15.948 --> 20:17.182
Yeah. How's it going?

20:18.150 --> 20:21.119
Yeah, we heard from Niecy.

20:21.186 --> 20:22.421
So what did Mom and Dad say?

20:23.956 --> 20:25.023
Yeah, we figured.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.192
No, I know.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.394
But you know? This would've never ha...

20:30.896 --> 20:33.065
You know what? Never mind.

20:33.532 --> 20:35.467
Patrick, I'm gonna hand you off to PJ.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.202
No, stop.

20:39.237 --> 20:41.039
P, what up, dog?

20:43.508 --> 20:44.977
Yeah. How you doing?

20:46.545 --> 20:48.313
It's crazy. Crazy.

20:49.681 --> 20:52.317
Letta? She is...

20:54.219 --> 20:55.487
She went to the store.

20:56.288 --> 20:58.256
We're trying to make
Dad's barbecue sauce.

20:59.658 --> 21:01.960
Okay. I'm gonna let her know.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.129
I'll holla at you.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.399
Please, tell me what that was about.

21:07.466 --> 21:10.836
I need to keep a healthy distance
from all of this.

21:10.902 --> 21:13.105
It's just better
if I just stay out of it.

21:13.171 --> 21:14.906
For who, you or for them?

21:15.207 --> 21:16.475
For all of us.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.579
Do you want me
butting into everything again?

21:20.646 --> 21:22.614
Just sweeping in
trying to fix everything?

21:22.681 --> 21:23.915
Definitely not.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.785
Exactly.
So let's just focus on this recipe.

21:27.486 --> 21:28.453
I'm over this.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.722
I think it needs more
vinegar. Definitely.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.659
- You're gonna make me hate barbecue.
- Come on!

21:45.871 --> 21:47.105
All right.

21:49.908 --> 21:51.176
Sure you don't want me to wait?

21:51.443 --> 21:53.045
No. I told you I got this.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.365
Dante!

22:16.034 --> 22:17.135
Come on.

22:24.576 --> 22:26.978
No, he didn't.
Stay right here. Hold your sister.

22:28.647 --> 22:30.182
Amika, what the hell is going on?

22:30.248 --> 22:32.350
I was about to ask you
the same damn thing.

22:32.417 --> 22:34.152
Just give me the keys to my damn car.

22:34.219 --> 22:36.388
- Your car?
- Yes, my car! It belongs to me.

22:41.493 --> 22:43.428
So he's playing us both, right?

22:43.495 --> 22:46.832
Well, I'm done with his cheating ass.
For good this time.

22:47.132 --> 22:48.366
You can have him.

22:50.235 --> 22:51.837
So he clearly ain't showing up

22:52.437 --> 22:55.273
until someone's knocking up
his next baby momma.

22:56.742 --> 22:58.009
You all want a ride home?

22:58.710 --> 23:00.712
No. I'll call Uber.

23:03.749 --> 23:04.850
Treyvion, hand me that.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.553
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

23:09.287 --> 23:11.590
Mommy's gonna clean this, alright?

23:12.491 --> 23:13.692
Why are you pouting?

23:15.994 --> 23:17.162
You're a good mom.

23:17.929 --> 23:19.064
Who, me?

23:20.432 --> 23:21.900
It's hard, you know?

23:22.601 --> 23:25.737
I can't keep a job.
I got nobody help me watch Marquis.

23:27.105 --> 23:28.273
How you do it with two?

23:29.674 --> 23:30.976
My family helps me out a lot.

23:33.044 --> 23:35.046
My family's barely hanging on themselves.

23:35.947 --> 23:37.282
They ain't got time to help me.

23:38.650 --> 23:41.620
Marquis started throwing this tantrum
when he don't get his way.

23:42.287 --> 23:44.289
I can't even say,
"Wait till Daddy gets home"

23:44.356 --> 23:46.057
'cause Dante don't care.

23:47.058 --> 23:48.960
Ain't no telling
when I'll see him anyway.

23:50.428 --> 23:51.563
It's all on me.

23:52.397 --> 23:55.600
Sometimes, I just wanna walk away
and keep walking

23:56.935 --> 23:58.236
I know I can't, but...

24:04.509 --> 24:05.610
You know?

24:07.179 --> 24:09.114
Since our kids share father, I think

24:09.581 --> 24:11.883
we should get them together
for some play dates.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.051
That's a good idea.

24:14.886 --> 24:16.488
They should know each other, right?

24:17.088 --> 24:18.190
Yeah, they should.

24:24.930 --> 24:28.066
Hey, Dad. Can I ask you a question

24:28.133 --> 24:29.334
Yeah, son.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.236
Man to man, father to father.

24:32.204 --> 24:33.471
What's on your mind?

24:33.872 --> 24:35.807
Niecy and this latest screw-up.

24:36.174 --> 24:37.375
I mean...

24:37.776 --> 24:40.078
I don't know
if I'm just handling it right.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.047
What am I supposed to do? Ground her?

24:43.515 --> 24:46.351
A grown woman with two kids?
Good luck with that.

24:46.418 --> 24:47.919
Yeah, but I gotta do something.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.591
You know? Your mom and I
made the same mistake

24:52.657 --> 24:54.559
with you when you were going through your

24:54.926 --> 24:56.061
rough patches.

24:56.394 --> 24:58.597
We tried to control the situation.

24:59.130 --> 25:00.465
Nothing worked.

25:00.532 --> 25:04.169
Son, sometimes the best thing
a parent can do is nothing.

25:05.537 --> 25:08.073
Sometimes you just gotta let your kids
fall down.

25:08.974 --> 25:10.175
Yeah, but...

25:10.709 --> 25:13.144
It's hard just to sit back
and watch your kid fall.

25:14.145 --> 25:15.914
Nobody said it's gonna be easy.

25:16.781 --> 25:19.451
Just make sure you're there
to help her up if she needs it.

25:19.918 --> 25:21.052
Okay.

25:22.687 --> 25:25.824
And thanks, Dad,
for always being there for me.

25:26.625 --> 25:27.859
No matter what.

25:27.926 --> 25:30.528
Hey, that's what dads do.

25:32.063 --> 25:33.365
That's what we do.

25:37.235 --> 25:38.937
- I love you, Dad.
- Love you too.

25:39.271 --> 25:40.772
- You good?
- Yeah, thanks.

25:44.843 --> 25:46.244
Bye, Marquis baby.

25:47.445 --> 25:51.283
You are strapped in? You are so cute.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.385
Mom, I like Marquis.

25:55.353 --> 25:56.588
That's nice, baby.

25:57.188 --> 25:58.657
He is my brother, right?

25:58.723 --> 26:00.625
No, sweetie, I told you. Remember?

26:01.293 --> 26:03.962
Dante is Isabel and Marquis' father.

26:04.562 --> 26:06.164
But he still loves you just the same.

26:06.631 --> 26:09.234
Why can't my dad come around like Dante?

26:12.737 --> 26:15.740
Treyvion, sweetie, I told you.
Cameron is your father.

26:16.341 --> 26:17.409
But why?

26:19.945 --> 26:22.047
- That's just the way it happened.
- Why?

26:22.414 --> 26:24.849
Cameron... He loves you very much.

26:24.916 --> 26:28.453
He's just been busy with his new job
and his new fiancée.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.722
But he sends money for you every month.

26:31.122 --> 26:33.825
I want Isabel and Marquis
to be my family.

26:37.896 --> 26:40.432
Sweetie, can you go
get in the car, please?

27:04.022 --> 27:06.057
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Niecy. How's it going?</i>

27:06.358 --> 27:08.159
Auntie, I've been waiting on your call.

27:08.226 --> 27:11.329
I was trying to give you some space.
But you know I can't hold my tongue.

27:11.396 --> 27:15.233
Do you think I'm a stupid fool
for messing around with Dante again?

27:16.501 --> 27:18.269
<i>I don't know what else to do.</i>

27:18.603 --> 27:20.472
Baby girl, there is not

27:20.972 --> 27:23.775
a woman on this Earth
that's not been a fool for love.

27:24.809 --> 27:26.144
Some of us more than once.

27:27.012 --> 27:29.547
Guess I was just seduced

27:31.816 --> 27:34.719
by the thought
of having a father for my kids again.

27:38.690 --> 27:40.025
I made a mess.

27:40.291 --> 27:44.496
Niecy, you have two beautiful,
intelligent children.

27:44.562 --> 27:46.031
And you're a good mother.

27:46.464 --> 27:50.602
You have a very loving, supportive family
that supports you even when you fail.

27:51.469 --> 27:54.072
Now, your baby daddies
leave a lot to be desired,

27:54.139 --> 27:55.707
but you have a father and a grandfather

27:55.774 --> 27:57.308
<i>who are willing to pick up the slack.</i>

27:57.375 --> 27:59.010
Yeah, but you should've seen how mad

27:59.077 --> 28:01.179
my dad was
when he found out about that car.

28:01.246 --> 28:02.414
<i>I know he was.</i>

28:02.480 --> 28:05.850
And I know it must feel like you have the
weight of the world on your shoulders,

28:06.217 --> 28:07.685
but you're barely 22 years old.

28:08.787 --> 28:10.021
And the Niecy that I know,

28:10.622 --> 28:12.657
<i>that girl can do anything
she sets her mind to.</i>

28:13.725 --> 28:16.795
So maybe you use this time
to figure out whatever that is.

28:17.896 --> 28:19.564
For your sake and the sake of those kids.

28:20.131 --> 28:21.366
Thank you, Auntie.

28:24.903 --> 28:28.239
I guess you're really enjoying New York.

28:28.807 --> 28:30.008
What makes you say that?

28:30.408 --> 28:31.476
<i>Well...</i>

28:32.310 --> 28:34.813
You sound way more chilled.
That's for sure.

28:35.914 --> 28:36.981
And...

28:38.149 --> 28:42.153
I guess you're enjoying
the big living now.

28:43.121 --> 28:44.456
I suppose I am.

28:46.591 --> 28:50.061
Hey, listen, baby. I got to go.
But I love you.

28:50.428 --> 28:51.529
I love you too.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.532
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:54.599 --> 28:55.733
Did you enjoy the tour?

28:55.800 --> 28:58.470
- Yeah, they're using some cool offices.
- I know, right?

28:59.037 --> 29:01.339
Yeah. But why are you here on a Saturday?

29:01.673 --> 29:04.309
I'm trying to get some work done
since Lee's out of town.

29:05.743 --> 29:07.445
Just got off the phone with Niecy.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.615
God. Is she alright?

29:11.049 --> 29:12.584
I think so. But...

29:13.084 --> 29:15.987
I probably should've gone down there
on the weekend or something.

29:16.354 --> 29:17.989
Wait. You're playing, right?

29:18.256 --> 29:21.292
No. If I was there, Niecy would've put
the money in a trust

29:21.359 --> 29:23.461
and not blown it on Dante and weaves.

29:23.528 --> 29:25.530
Thought you were done
playing the rescuer.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.165
- I am.
- Okay, so be done with it.

29:27.565 --> 29:29.400
They need to figure
this out on their own.

29:29.467 --> 29:31.503
Especially now
that you are here in New York.

29:31.569 --> 29:32.604
Seriously.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.875
- Did I do the right thing?
- Yes. Of course you did the right thing.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.209
If you had gone down there,

29:38.276 --> 29:40.178
all you would've done
is make everybody crazy.

29:40.245 --> 29:42.514
- Thank you.
- You know I'm telling the truth.

29:45.483 --> 29:49.354
Thanks again for hooking Ava with this.
That scored major points with her mom.

29:49.420 --> 29:50.955
I owe you. Big time.

29:51.022 --> 29:53.525
You do. Big time. And you can pay me back

29:53.591 --> 29:56.961
by finding me a cheap short sale
or a hot foreclosure.

29:57.028 --> 29:58.763
Something I can get for a steal.

29:58.830 --> 30:00.532
- I got you.
- Please.

30:00.832 --> 30:03.301
Let me get this girl home.
I'll call you later, okay?

30:04.068 --> 30:05.303
Watch your step.

30:05.803 --> 30:08.106
Listen, thank you.
I know that getting their help

30:08.173 --> 30:09.874
with this internship was a big deal.

30:09.941 --> 30:12.076
Don't mention it.
it's the least I can do.

30:14.345 --> 30:17.048
All right. If you need anything,
you shoot me a text, okay?

30:18.016 --> 30:20.585
You are not coming out to celebrate?

30:20.852 --> 30:22.220
Where did you get that?

30:22.287 --> 30:25.757
A visit to Aaron Felty's office
was included on the studio tour.

30:26.124 --> 30:28.126
His bar is very well stocked.

30:28.193 --> 30:31.162
You're joking, right?
You lifted that from the anchor's office?

30:32.697 --> 30:34.799
Are you trying to get fired
on your first day?

30:34.866 --> 30:36.234
Don't be such a buzzkill.

30:37.835 --> 30:39.737
Come back to my place.
Have a drink with me.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.074
I've got an appointment to get to.

30:43.441 --> 30:44.876
And I'm taking this.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.778
Come on. Feet in.

30:55.486 --> 30:59.057
Deja, just go with the other girls

30:59.123 --> 31:02.794
while Grandma talks to the ladies here,
has a little conversation.

31:02.860 --> 31:03.928
Okay.

31:06.197 --> 31:08.800
Helen, perhaps
I didn't make myself clear.

31:09.467 --> 31:12.036
I'm sorry
if this is difficult for you to accept.

31:12.103 --> 31:15.039
But Deja will not be invited
to join "Jack and Jane."

31:15.573 --> 31:18.276
You made yourself loud and clear, Joan.

31:18.343 --> 31:21.412
But that's not exactly
how this is going down.

31:21.746 --> 31:22.847
Really?

31:22.914 --> 31:25.383
I'm not leaving here
until I've said my piece.

31:26.317 --> 31:30.555
Everyone here knows the challenges
my family has faced.

31:31.990 --> 31:35.360
But I can't tell you
how devastated we were

31:35.760 --> 31:39.530
and how isolated we felt
from the judgment

31:39.931 --> 31:41.599
in our community.

31:43.901 --> 31:46.704
Maybe I'm naive, but I never imagined

31:46.771 --> 31:49.641
that I would be faced
with the same judgment here

31:50.375 --> 31:51.709
from all of you.

31:53.011 --> 31:55.313
But I guess none of you can relate,

31:55.380 --> 31:58.683
because you are all blessed
with perfect families.

31:58.950 --> 32:03.688
I'm the only one who's had a family
that's been touched with scandal.

32:03.955 --> 32:05.223
Right, Diane?

32:06.591 --> 32:07.659
Mildred?

32:09.093 --> 32:11.763
Right. That's what I thought.

32:11.829 --> 32:13.264
Are you done, Helen?

32:19.470 --> 32:21.105
I suppose I am.

32:23.741 --> 32:24.842
Helen, wait.

32:27.912 --> 32:31.115
My family, we're getting ready
to file for bankruptcy.

32:31.182 --> 32:35.186
Now you may want to throw Jessica out too
after you've heard that.

32:36.154 --> 32:37.288
But it's the truth.

32:38.656 --> 32:40.958
We bailed our kids out so many times

32:41.526 --> 32:43.161
there's just simply nothing left.

32:45.763 --> 32:47.265
I'm leaving Charles.

32:48.866 --> 32:51.169
Something I should've done long ago.

32:51.836 --> 32:55.940
We've been married in name only
for at least six years.

32:58.376 --> 33:00.044
We all have issues, Joan.

33:01.145 --> 33:02.447
That's right.

33:02.513 --> 33:05.183
We do a valuable work here.

33:06.184 --> 33:10.221
But with the challenges and difficulties
black families have today,

33:10.521 --> 33:13.391
we have to support each other.

33:14.158 --> 33:16.527
That's the kind of organization
I want Deja

33:16.594 --> 33:20.164
and my daughters and granddaughters
to be a part of.

33:20.231 --> 33:21.766
And you should too.

33:43.388 --> 33:44.455
Everything okay?

33:45.723 --> 33:47.959
Yeah, fine.

33:56.701 --> 33:58.202
Listen to your gut, Niecy.

34:00.138 --> 34:02.073
- My gut?
- Yeah.

34:03.441 --> 34:05.977
The gut has a way of letting you know
you've had enough.

34:07.345 --> 34:08.846
Feels like a stomachache to me.

34:10.381 --> 34:13.451
Yeah, the gut I'm talking about
is your instincts.

34:14.685 --> 34:16.954
And your instincts tell you
when enough is enough.

34:17.989 --> 34:20.591
But the trick is
you gotta listen to them.

34:20.858 --> 34:21.959
Right.

34:23.594 --> 34:24.829
I'll be back.

34:25.830 --> 34:26.764
Okay.

34:33.337 --> 34:34.505
What took you so long?

34:36.073 --> 34:37.842
Sorry, my phone was off.

34:38.709 --> 34:40.378
So what's up, girl? How're you gonna

34:40.445 --> 34:42.613
just take my car like that?
No call or nothing?

34:42.680 --> 34:46.984
You mean the car I bought that you had
some bitch driving? That car?

34:47.518 --> 34:50.688
Don't give me that crap, Niecy.
Amika's my baby momma too.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.024
I gotta help her out sometimes,
just like I help you.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.694
- Come on, baby...
- No! No, no.

34:57.261 --> 35:01.199
Don't baby me.
I am sick of you babying me.

35:01.265 --> 35:02.467
Why don't you just admit it?

35:03.167 --> 35:04.335
Admit what?

35:04.402 --> 35:06.704
That this is all a lie, Dante!

35:08.005 --> 35:10.808
You don't care about me!
You don't care about those kids!

35:11.275 --> 35:13.945
All you care about is the new car,
the new clothes,

35:14.011 --> 35:16.414
the restaurants, the TV that I got you.

35:16.481 --> 35:18.883
You used me! Just admit it!

35:19.484 --> 35:21.352
Laid up with Amika the whole time?

35:22.653 --> 35:24.188
And God knows whoever else!

35:24.255 --> 35:26.824
You can't believe anything Amika say.
You know she crazy.

35:28.125 --> 35:29.327
It's gone, Dante.

35:30.495 --> 35:33.297
The money? It's gone.
I had to give it all back.

35:34.732 --> 35:35.833
So, what now?

35:36.734 --> 35:38.336
What do you mean you gave it all back?

35:44.308 --> 35:45.476
Where are you going?

35:45.843 --> 35:47.278
- Niecy.
- Don't call me!

35:48.045 --> 35:50.648
Don't call me
unless it has to do with Isabel.

35:51.148 --> 35:54.986
Don't call me for sex! Don't call me
for rides, money, none of it!

35:55.052 --> 35:57.555
Don't call me! I'm done! I'm done!

35:57.822 --> 35:59.790
- So it's like that?
- Yeah, it's like that!

36:00.124 --> 36:03.094
Ride off on your damn bike. Stupid-ass.

36:12.837 --> 36:15.473
- Is the food ready?
- Almost there.

36:15.540 --> 36:18.409
Good, 'cause we've got
some celebrating to do.

36:18.476 --> 36:20.144
- Yeah?
- That's right.

36:20.211 --> 36:23.247
Meet the newest member
of "Jack and Jane."

36:25.449 --> 36:27.919
- Congratulations.
- My little girl!

36:33.291 --> 36:34.625
First down! All right.

36:40.431 --> 36:41.766
Room service.

36:43.301 --> 36:44.902
What's all this?

36:44.969 --> 36:50.908
OK. So, I had Dad overnight
a couple slabs of ribs to the hotel.

36:51.642 --> 36:54.011
<i>The kitchen reheated them and voilà!</i>

36:55.613 --> 36:59.116
Yes, a little bit of ATL magic
right here in the Big Apple.

36:59.183 --> 37:03.321
- Come on. Thank you!
- Yes.

37:03.387 --> 37:05.856
- That's the way to cure homesickness.
- Alright, so...

37:05.923 --> 37:09.860
I've got to call the family.
They're waiting for us to FaceTime, okay?

37:09.927 --> 37:11.329
- Okay.
- Here we go.

37:13.164 --> 37:14.432
<i>- Hello?
- Hey!</i>

37:15.032 --> 37:19.337
Hey, Daddy, I'm so excited!
PJ, he just brought the ribs.

37:20.237 --> 37:22.807
<i>Letta, PJ, what's going on?</i>

37:23.107 --> 37:27.178
Mom, hit the button on the right.
The one that looks like a TV, remember?

37:27.244 --> 37:28.713
Right there, yes.

37:28.779 --> 37:31.215
I'm pushing the button.
But why can't we see them?

37:32.283 --> 37:33.951
<i>This thing is not working.</i>

37:34.018 --> 37:36.621
Okay, we've been doing this
for months now, guys. Come on.

37:36.687 --> 37:39.056
Why can't we do the old-fashioned way?

37:39.123 --> 37:40.558
- Patrick.
- Just get a phone.

37:41.292 --> 37:45.062
<i>So, listen. We will talk to you later.</i>

37:45.129 --> 37:48.165
We're having some technical difficulties
on our end, okay?

37:48.499 --> 37:51.502
- But thank you so much for the ribs.
- Thank you! We love you!

37:51.569 --> 37:52.536
We love you so much!

37:57.642 --> 37:59.176
Yes. Right there.

38:00.411 --> 38:01.579
Well...

38:02.113 --> 38:04.181
If we can't be home
with our crazy family,

38:04.248 --> 38:06.083
at least we have each other.

38:06.851 --> 38:08.986
- And Dad's ribs.
- And Dad's ribs.

38:10.388 --> 38:13.624
Let me get some napkins, forks,
spoons, all the above.

38:55.199 --> 38:59.770
Hey, baby. Why aren't you downstairs
watching the Super Bowl?

39:02.273 --> 39:03.474
Not feeling it today?

39:05.109 --> 39:07.978
Well, guess what?
I've got a surprise for you.

39:08.846 --> 39:10.047
Wanna take a ride with mommy?

39:11.549 --> 39:13.617
Yeah, you wanna take a ride with mommy.
Come on!

39:14.218 --> 39:15.920
I've got something to show you. Come on.

39:22.727 --> 39:26.597
All right, babe. Do you understand
why Mom has to return the car?

39:27.998 --> 39:29.500
Well, you know,

39:29.567 --> 39:33.604
sometimes adults, we buy things
that we can't really afford.

39:33.671 --> 39:35.673
So, we have to take it back.

39:36.674 --> 39:38.409
But before I do that,

39:38.476 --> 39:41.812
I wanted to make sure that we got
our chance to have some fun with it.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.180
So are you ready?

39:43.247 --> 39:45.182
- For what?
- For this.

39:46.617 --> 39:49.687
<i>I am a single black mother of two.</i>

39:51.889 --> 39:54.458
<i>Who hasn't always made
the best decisions.</i>

39:54.992 --> 39:57.862
<i>But I'm here.
And I ain't going away silently.</i>

39:58.796 --> 40:00.931
<i>'Cause, see? I'm a black woman</i>

40:00.998 --> 40:03.300
<i>who had the nerve to raise her voice.</i>

40:07.605 --> 40:10.274
<i>And that's why this bitch got tased.</i>
