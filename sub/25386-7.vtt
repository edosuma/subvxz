00:10.593 --> 00:12.679
I can't wait
for the camp
lobster festival tonight.

00:12.679 --> 00:16.266
Yeah, it will be
a lot more fun than
Ravi's geometry theme party.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.686
Hey, Pythagorean Palooza
was a big hit.

00:20.603 --> 00:22.272
No, it wasn't.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.275
It was so boring,

00:25.275 --> 00:27.027
half the campers
tried to escape

00:27.027 --> 00:28.153
by swimming across the lake.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.572
It was a hot day.
They were just cooling off.

00:30.572 --> 00:31.573
End of story.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.451
Whatevs.
As our new camp chef,

00:34.451 --> 00:36.745
you have to make sure
the lobster dinner
is fabulous.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.663
This is our first time
in charge of the festival

00:38.663 --> 00:40.040
and it has to be perfect.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.624
Have no fear.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.626
I shall start
with a lobster salad,

00:43.626 --> 00:45.795
followed by
a delicious lobster Newburg,

00:45.795 --> 00:48.840
and desert
will be a lobster pudding.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.675
Lobster pudding?

00:51.009 --> 00:53.261
There's gonna be
a bunch of more campers
hitting the lake.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.097
Okay people,

00:56.097 --> 00:57.265
put your claws together

00:57.265 --> 00:59.434
for the centerpiece
of the festival,

01:01.019 --> 01:02.187
Larry, the lobster.

01:03.563 --> 01:06.441
Wow. Considering Mrs. Mommy
made him 30 years ago

01:06.441 --> 01:07.901
for the first
lobster festival,

01:07.901 --> 01:08.985
he looks pretty good.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.030
You could still see
the great Christina's
fingerprints.

01:12.947 --> 01:14.324
I don't think it's a good idea

01:14.324 --> 01:16.993
that Lou has access
to Mom's fingerprints.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.454
So,

01:19.454 --> 01:21.206
Ravi, you're in charge
of the food.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.999
Lou and I are
in charge of entertainment.

01:23.666 --> 01:24.959
Think that covers everything.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.628
Wait, what am I
in charge off?

01:28.004 --> 01:29.047
Folding the napkins.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.049
Folding the napkins?

Zuri, you really wanna be

more delightful

02:16.010 --> 02:17.804
than a crate
crammed with crustaceans?

02:18.763 --> 02:21.057
Ravi, I haven't seen you
this excited

02:21.057 --> 02:22.976
since you got
you first chest hair.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.437
Update, that turned out
to be a stray cat hair.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.398
But yes, I am excited.

Lobster's yummy.

And those little bibs
are so cute.

how they're cooked,

02:41.911 --> 02:43.037
boiled alive.

What? Alive?

02:45.415 --> 02:46.916
Yes, alive.

02:50.587 --> 02:53.214

setting up the stage
for the lobster brother show.

They're always the highlight
of the camp festival.

02:55.675 --> 02:59.053
Yeah. And I'm really sorry
Finn smashed Larry.

02:59.053 --> 03:00.346
He can be
a bit out of control.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.016
I once lost him at the zoo
and found him an hour later

03:03.016 --> 03:04.767
flinging his own poop
at the monkeys.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.645
Look, don't worry.

03:07.645 --> 03:09.981
Zuri's willing to babysit Finn
and make sure he fixes Larry.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.316
That's awfully nice of Zuri.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.746

Okay.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.015
Sorry, I'll clean it up.

Uh-oh.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.563

Just stop and I'll clean
it up myself.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.361

04:11.376 --> 04:12.377
Um,

04:12.752 --> 04:14.629
what are we doing
in the lobster tank?

are rubber-banded together?

do not pinch me

04:22.470 --> 04:24.264

04:24.264 --> 04:25.265

Oh, I'm not
dressed like a lobster,

04:31.354 --> 04:32.897

04:33.147 --> 04:35.191

why were you screaming?

Were you dreaming about
showering without sandals?

04:57.880 --> 05:00.049
That's a recurring nightmare
that I have.

05:00.883 --> 05:01.968
No.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.886
I dreamed that
Ravi was a lobster,

05:03.886 --> 05:07.140
and he was about to dump us
in boiling water and eat us.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.933
But were we wearing sandals?

05:09.892 --> 05:12.145
Stop worrying
about foot fungus.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.147
We have to save
those lobsters.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.609
Add a little parsley,

05:19.485 --> 05:20.737
and perfect.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.905
The stage is all set
for the lobster brothers.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.533
That big bowl of melted butter
is making me hungry.

05:25.908 --> 05:28.453
Oh, that's actually
toxic sludge
I skimmed off the lake.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.873
That toxic sludge
is making me hungry.

Oh, no.

Don't get any sludge
in your mouth

05:51.184 --> 05:53.102
or ideally even touch it,
but we're past that.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.314
Zuri, isn't Emma paying you
to watch Finn?

05:56.856 --> 05:57.899
Not enough.

05:59.275 --> 06:02.361
Okay, I'll go make sure
he doesn't cause
any more trouble.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.489
On an unrelated note,

06:04.489 --> 06:06.199
where do we keep
the electric fencing?

DESTINY: Ravi,

06:14.373 --> 06:17.335
the lobster bibs
arrived for your
seafood torture party.

06:18.252 --> 06:20.296
I prefer to call it
a festival.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.215
What...

06:22.215 --> 06:24.133
Why are these bibs so tiny?

06:24.675 --> 06:28.137
It looks like they
made bibs for the
lobsters instead of us.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.265
Well, I'm going to give
quit the verbal dressing down

06:31.265 --> 06:34.519
to the not-so-fine people
at Bippity Boppity Bibs.

06:39.857 --> 06:41.359
I can't believe
Ravi fell for it.

06:48.366 --> 06:51.160
How did you sew
all those tiny bibs so fast?

06:51.452 --> 06:53.121
I have a lot of
hidden talents.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.622
I also know Krav Maga.

06:55.289 --> 06:57.166
Never mess with me.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.378
It wasn't on my list.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.881
Now quick, we have to switch
the real lobsters

07:04.757 --> 07:06.008
with these fake ones.

07:06.425 --> 07:07.552
Got it.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.264
Aww.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.849
I'm gonna name her Shelly.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.976
She's so cute,
I could kiss her.

07:16.185 --> 07:19.439
You do know lobsters pee
from their faces, right?

07:20.523 --> 07:22.400
And into the bag you go.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.280
How're we gonna soak up
all this fake butter
by tonight?

07:27.738 --> 07:29.240
A big piece of fake toast?

07:29.949 --> 07:32.869
No offense Lou, but Finn is
a walking demolition derby.

07:32.869 --> 07:35.329
I'd feel safer around
a baboon juggling chainsaws.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.292
You wouldn't say that
if you'd ever been
to Buster's Bargain Circus.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.420
And Zuri could have kept
a better eye on him.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.505
Well, in her defense,
trying to control Finn

07:44.505 --> 07:46.757
is like trying to
lasso a tornado.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.343

tried that once.

07:49.844 --> 07:50.887
How'd that work out?

I'll let you know
if I ever see him again.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.458
Nothing.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.335
Oh, then it is
going splendidly.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.382
Ravi, remember when you
asked me to tell you

08:28.382 --> 08:29.383
when you're being weird?

08:30.384 --> 08:31.344
Well, you're doing it now.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.472
Okay. Bye.

08:39.435 --> 08:40.436
Hey.

08:41.979 --> 08:44.190
You know what would be cooler
than a papier mache lobster?

08:44.482 --> 08:46.192
A real lobster?

08:46.526 --> 08:49.278
With a steak and
a roof-top view of the city?

08:50.363 --> 08:51.739
I really miss New York.

08:53.449 --> 08:54.784
No.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.994
A papier mache Lobzilla.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.205
It would have giant claws...

08:59.205 --> 09:02.625
And a huge tail that it could
whip at my enemies.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.710
I mean, its enemies.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.714
And it would destroy
everything in its path.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.425
Ooh, can it start
with Ravi and Emma?

09:11.676 --> 09:14.303
That way, I will inherit
even more money.

09:15.763 --> 09:18.683
But maybe there's been
enough destruction
for one day.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.184
Why don't you
get back to work.

09:20.184 --> 09:21.310
No way.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.937
I gotta make Lobzilla now!

09:23.521 --> 09:24.814
I'll go get the chainsaw.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.861
I can't get out.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.406
What is this thing?

09:33.406 --> 09:34.448
It's a child-proof lock.

09:34.865 --> 09:37.868
I use one of those
on my bedroom door
to keep Emma out.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.662
It's been six years

09:39.662 --> 09:42.123
and the woman still can't
figure out how it works.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.586
Meanwhile, you need to
get back to
working on that lobster.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.129
I'll help you.

09:48.838 --> 09:49.964
Thanks, Zuri.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.216
I had a lot of fun
hanging out with you today.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.677
Yeah, I am pretty great
to hang out with.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.221
And so are you.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.225
Even though you glued
your hands to your butt
three times.

10:01.809 --> 10:02.810
Four.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.649
I can't believe those
stupid lobsters ran away.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.484
Don't they know
we're trying to save them?

10:10.943 --> 10:13.613
They spent the whole day
waiting to be cooked alive.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.531
You can't blame them
for having trust issues.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.409
Oh, here's one.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.536
Found one.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.413

10:28.252 --> 10:30.046
It's Ravi.
Quick, hide the bag.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.467
Oh, there you two are.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.968
What do you have to say
about this?

10:37.345 --> 10:39.221
If that's
an attempt at sculpting,

10:39.472 --> 10:40.890
you need to find a new hobby.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.434
Cut the horse hockey.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.019
I know you two
took my lobsters

10:45.019 --> 10:46.812
and replaced them
with plastic ones.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.230
Where are the real ones?

10:51.275 --> 10:52.610
How should we know?

10:52.610 --> 10:54.737
We're not gonna help you
find your victims, sicko.

10:58.574 --> 10:59.950
There are no lobsters in here.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.952
Perhaps they're
in the Woodchuck cabin.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.752
Hey guys, it worked.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.546
Except, one of you
gave me a purple nurple.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.218
Guys, hide!

11:19.595 --> 11:21.097
Destiny, what is the matter?

11:21.514 --> 11:22.723
I'm sick.

11:22.723 --> 11:23.724
(COUGHS)

11:25.184 --> 11:27.978
This whole lobster thing
has really taken a toll on me.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.397
Oh, really?

11:29.397 --> 11:31.148
Perhaps it's the
guilt you feel

11:31.148 --> 11:32.733
for absconding
with my lobsters

11:32.733 --> 11:34.902
which are no doubt, in here.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.113
(SCREAMS) Ladies' dainties!

11:41.242 --> 11:42.701
Ow. See?

11:42.701 --> 11:44.578
This is why
people try to cook you.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.126
J'accuse!

11:50.543 --> 11:51.544
Gesundheit.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.380
The jig is up.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.841
Where have you hidden
my main course?

11:57.591 --> 11:58.801
If you have any questions,

11:59.176 --> 12:00.469
talk to my attorney.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.305
As her attorney,

12:04.640 --> 12:06.642
I suggest that you
don't make her angry.

12:07.351 --> 12:08.936
She knows Krav Maga.

12:09.979 --> 12:13.607
Oh, I have ways
of making you talk.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.819
Please, please, please,
just tell me!

12:17.069 --> 12:18.487
This dinner
is really important.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.531
I'll be your best friend
forever and ever.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.535
Okay, okay. We released them.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.371
Now stop torturing us.
We're just children.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.375
You folded faster
than a wet taco.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.752
Snitches get stitches.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.504
Don't make me
break out my Krav Maga.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.758
Man, this is a rough camp.

12:41.427 --> 12:42.678
You're too late, Ravi.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.054
We saved the lobsters

12:44.346 --> 12:46.348
and now they're
swimming free in the lake.

12:46.891 --> 12:47.975
What?

12:47.975 --> 12:49.059
That means you drowned them.

12:49.059 --> 12:51.270
Lobsters die in fresh water.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.688
They do?

12:52.688 --> 12:54.857
Oh, no! Shelly's gonna drown.

12:55.232 --> 12:58.110
Now I must go rescue them
from your rescue attempt

12:58.110 --> 12:59.236
so I can cook them.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.363
Ah, I see the irony.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.747
Okay, we're ready to paint
Larry the Lobster.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.332
You guys have
any red paint?

13:11.665 --> 13:12.917
I think there's some
in the shed.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.211
Yeah, Ravi uses it to
paint the rotten apples.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.296
I love the shed.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.632
That's where
all the rusty
power tools are.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.262
Emma, what time are
the Lobster Bothers
supposed to get here?

13:25.804 --> 13:27.264
I don't know. You talked
to them on the phone.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.558
No. I thought you were
gonna call them.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.269
Wait? So they're not
coming?
Oh, no.

13:33.771 --> 13:37.107
The entire camp
is expecting the best in
lobster-themed entertainment.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.318
Quick, call them.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.529
(CROWS CAWING)

13:41.904 --> 13:44.698
MAN: Hello, you've reached
The Lobster Brothers.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.867
Since no one wanted
to hire us,

13:46.867 --> 13:49.453
as of today we quit
show business.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.623
Ugh, this is
all Finn's fault.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.917
If we hadn't been so busy
rebuilding the stage,

13:54.917 --> 13:56.335
we would've remembered
to call.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.128
Well, we wouldn't have had
to rebuild the stage

13:58.128 --> 14:00.839
if Zuri had babysat him
like she was supposed to.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.633
Then we could've called
the Lobster Brothers in time

14:02.633 --> 14:04.301
and they wouldn't have had
to quit show business.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.429
(SCOFFS)

14:07.680 --> 14:09.598
So, that's why you're
hanging out with me?

14:10.349 --> 14:11.767
To babysit me?

14:12.768 --> 14:14.311
I thought you were
my friend.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.356
I am your friend.

14:17.356 --> 14:18.941
I'm just getting paid for it.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.860
It's a win-win.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.494
Finn, can we talk?

14:31.787 --> 14:34.748
I don't need a babysitter,
so you can leave.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.001
I'd open the door
for you,

14:37.001 --> 14:39.670
but I still can't figure out
that the plastic thing
on the handle.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.716
Finn, I'm really sorry.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.927
The truth is, I did start
hanging out with you

14:46.927 --> 14:49.346
because Emma and Lou
asked me to keep
an eye on you.

14:50.389 --> 14:51.640
And maybe a leash.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.268
I didn't mean
to ruin anything.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.103
I was just trying to
have fun.

14:56.729 --> 15:00.399
Well, can't you have fun
without taking a wrecking ball
to everything?

15:01.108 --> 15:03.360
Did Lou tell you about
the wrecking ball incident?

15:03.986 --> 15:06.780
All I did was turn
our kitchen into
a drive-thru.

15:07.531 --> 15:08.949
Awesome!

15:08.949 --> 15:10.284
I mean, don't do that here,

15:10.534 --> 15:11.827
but awesome. (CHUCKLES)

15:12.119 --> 15:13.871
My point is...

15:13.871 --> 15:15.664
I may have been
babysitting you,

15:15.956 --> 15:17.750
but while I was doing it

15:17.750 --> 15:19.501
I realized you're
a really cool kid.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.462
You don't have to lie to me.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.255
I'm not lying.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.634
You're funny,
extremely energetic,

15:27.051 --> 15:29.428
and you have amazing ideas.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.305
Like that Lobzilla thing.

15:31.972 --> 15:33.140
Thanks.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.935
You should've seen
my Tyrannosaurus-cat.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.687
Our dog's been under the couch
for a year.

15:39.772 --> 15:43.025
Hard to believe
anybody thought
you needed a babysitter.

15:43.025 --> 15:43.817

Lobster Brothers!

15:56.288 --> 15:57.790
The campers are not going
to be happy

15:57.790 --> 15:59.875
when we tell them
the Lobster Brothers
aren't coming.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.251
They're everyone's favorite.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.795
Yeah, we really should've
broken it to them

16:02.795 --> 16:05.714
before we handed out
those wooden lobster mallets
and tiny forks.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.175
Well...

16:08.717 --> 16:09.843
Be careful out there.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.013
Me? Why do I have to
tell them?

16:13.013 --> 16:14.890
Because you can
take a punch
better than me.

16:16.016 --> 16:18.936
Wait. What if we do
the Lobster Brothers
performance?

16:20.020 --> 16:22.564
Lou, you didn't swallow
any of that toxic fake butter,
did you?

16:22.982 --> 16:24.984
Why? (MUMBLES)
Is my tongue glowing?

16:26.443 --> 16:27.569
Little bit.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.197
Where are we even gonna
find lobster costumes?

16:30.614 --> 16:33.659
There's got to be costumes
in all those boxes
of lobster stuff.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.036
Gladys had a crush on the guy
who ran the Lob-Store,

16:36.036 --> 16:38.205
so she kept going back
until she got everything
in there.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.040
Except a date.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.209
Okay, let's do it.

16:42.209 --> 16:44.878
If they hate it, at least
we'll have thick costumes
to protect us,

16:44.878 --> 16:46.630
if they try to stab us
with their tiny forks.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.804
Goodbye, Shelly.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.265
(SING SONGY) Cannot wait
to have you in the belly.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.936
Ravi, don't do this.

17:00.936 --> 17:03.731
Yeah.
Lobsters do have feelings.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.775
Please. Their brains are
the size of a pea.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.736
So is Finn's.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.487
It doesn't mean
we should cook him
and eat him.

17:11.739 --> 17:12.823
Definitely not.

17:14.658 --> 17:16.952
There isn't a temperature
high enough to cook off
all the bacteria.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.165
Come on, Ravi,
look into Shelly's eyes.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.876
If you don't see anything
worth saving in them,

17:24.418 --> 17:25.919
then go ahead and cook her.

17:26.503 --> 17:27.921
Fine.

17:30.841 --> 17:31.925
(SIGHS)

17:33.635 --> 17:35.345
Where exactly are her eyes?

17:35.721 --> 17:36.889
Oh, there.

17:37.264 --> 17:39.516
No, those are her antennae.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.061
That's her rostrum.

17:43.103 --> 17:44.146
There you go.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.648
Oh!

17:46.648 --> 17:48.942
Her eyes are
quite captivating.

17:49.693 --> 17:52.196
And they do convey
a profound sense of sadness.

17:52.654 --> 17:53.864
Of course they do.

17:54.114 --> 17:55.824
You're about to
boil her alive.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.870
Oh, look at that,
the poor thing is
starting to cry.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.288
You know...

18:01.288 --> 18:02.956
Do not tell him
that she's peeing.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.876
I do feel bad
for the little guys,

18:05.876 --> 18:08.295
but Emma and the campers
are counting on me.

18:08.545 --> 18:11.048
Well, Shelly's counting
on you too.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.674
And so are we.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.343
Please, Ravi.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.470
Please.

18:17.638 --> 18:18.889
Oh, very well.

18:19.306 --> 18:20.724
I shall spare them.

18:20.724 --> 18:21.892
Yay!

18:21.892 --> 18:22.976
Thank you, Ravi.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.228

figure out what I'm going to
serve to everyone.

21:44.803 --> 21:48.640
Okay, this year, since we
do not want to steal milk
from unwilling cows,

21:48.890 --> 21:50.100
I went with...

21:50.600 --> 21:52.019
All Cheese-less Pizza.

21:52.769 --> 21:54.313
(ALL BOOING)

21:54.646 --> 21:56.106
Get him!
(SCREAMING)

22:01.153 --> 22:02.738
(ALL BOOING)

22:04.531 --> 22:06.783
Ravi, bring out
the jalapeno poppers.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.244
ALL: Yay!

22:09.911 --> 22:11.163
Here we are.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.707
Delicious jalapeno poppers.

22:13.707 --> 22:16.209
Made with real,
actual jalapenos, right?

22:16.209 --> 22:19.212
(SCOFFS) Of course. There will
be no attacking me this year.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.299
Wait. Where are
the dipping sauces?

22:23.550 --> 22:25.177
Darn it!
(ALL BOOING)

22:25.761 --> 22:27.304
Get him!
(SCREAMING)
