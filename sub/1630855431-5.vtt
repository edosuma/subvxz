WEBVTT

00:17.100 --> 00:18.268
Ugh!

00:21.187 --> 00:22.188
Today's the day!

00:23.565 --> 00:25.442
Yes! Clark, I know you told me

00:25.442 --> 00:28.278
not to wake you up
every morning with an update
on how close we are

00:28.278 --> 00:31.156
to our camping-slash
Bigfoot-finding expedition,

00:31.156 --> 00:33.450
but it's squatchin' time.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.494
Oh, I guess you went jogging.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.496
Without me.

00:41.291 --> 00:46.421
A Flamebird
response video? What?

00:46.421 --> 00:50.508
<i>You may have seen
the video stream Flamebird
making claims like this.</i>

00:50.508 --> 00:55.221
<i>And to sum it up,
on the remains of Sub Diego
on the Pacific Sea floor</i>

00:55.221 --> 00:58.558
<i>proves that Atlantis is real.</i>

00:58.558 --> 01:01.478
<i>But I'm here
to tell you, nah!</i>

01:01.478 --> 01:05.815
<i>Like and subscribe to watch me
do this to every Flamebird
video ever.</i>

01:05.815 --> 01:09.944
<i>Nah, nah. Oh, yeah,
that's a nah.</i>

01:10.737 --> 01:11.863
What?

01:37.055 --> 01:38.765
I waited so we could
walk to work together.

01:38.765 --> 01:42.936
Oh, I had some errands to run.
Jimmy, I'm going for it today.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.354
Going for our squatchin' trip?

01:44.354 --> 01:45.980
No. I... I mean, that too.

01:45.980 --> 01:50.318
But I'm going to tell Lois
that I like her.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.529
Yeah, buddy, I think
she's picked up on that.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.198
But I haven't said the words
"I like you."

01:55.198 --> 01:57.075
It's just been implied.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.327
But, you know,
she's been staring at me
nonstop for the past day and--

01:59.327 --> 02:03.456
Speaking of things
that are today, the camping
trip to find Bigfoot.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.999
I packed the gear already.

02:04.999 --> 02:06.876
So just meet me
at the bus stop at 5:00 p.m.

02:06.876 --> 02:08.378
Yeah. That train's going
to crash.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.879
Yeah, I'm going to be late.
Cover me until I get in.

02:09.879 --> 02:11.506
Thanks.

02:12.757 --> 02:15.260
Lois, it's squatchin' day.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.886
Yeah, sure. I'm all packed.

02:16.886 --> 02:18.221
Random question.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.931
If I gave you a list of dates
and times,

02:19.931 --> 02:22.058
would you be able
to corroborate Clark's
whereabouts?

02:22.058 --> 02:25.270
For instance, on August 3rd,
he said he was going
to get a bagel,

02:25.270 --> 02:28.940
but he was gone for 20 minutes
and then he came back
without a bagel.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.068
Also, have you noticed
how often he steps out
for bagels?

02:32.068 --> 02:33.987
Is this hungry Lois calling?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.989
Do you need a bagel?

02:35.989 --> 02:39.909
No, no, I just...
There's this thing I think
might be true, but it's crazy.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.744
But I'm 99% sure I'm right.

02:41.744 --> 02:44.914
But before I do anything,
I need to be 100% sure.

02:44.914 --> 02:48.251
I have no idea what
you're talking about,
but I'm at the office.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.586
Oh, good. I'm running
a little late.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.254
Can you cover for me?
Thanks.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.423
Wait! Remember to meet me
at the bus stop at 5:00 p.m...

02:53.423 --> 02:56.217
...for squatchin'.

02:56.217 --> 02:59.095
All right, morning
is not going how I envisioned,

02:59.095 --> 03:00.847
but this is still going
to be the best--

03:00.847 --> 03:02.599
Scooped!

03:02.599 --> 03:05.268
That's right.
It's Steve Lombard,

03:05.268 --> 03:08.104
the <i>Daily Planet's</i>
star reporter.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.772
Steve, I know who you are.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.024
- Please do not--
- Think fast!

03:12.317 --> 03:13.943
Anyhow, grab your camera
and let's go.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.695
I asked Perry
for a photographer

03:15.695 --> 03:19.949
for a special assignment,
and you're it.

03:19.949 --> 03:22.201
Get ready
for the best day ever!

03:26.664 --> 03:28.166
Y'all know the score.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.627
Crush the alarms, grab the gold
and I'll hit the safe.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.546
- Anyone gives you trouble...
- Heh.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.505
Let's go.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.681
He's here!

03:43.681 --> 03:46.976
He's here.
Go! Go! Go!

03:46.976 --> 03:48.144
What?

03:52.148 --> 03:54.776
What?
Wait, you're--

03:55.985 --> 03:57.695
Rory, help me!

04:02.909 --> 04:06.996
All right, Clark,
how do I get you to tell me
you're Superman?

04:09.332 --> 04:11.918
Ugh, come on.
This isn't the mailroom.

04:13.002 --> 04:13.836
Ugh!

04:19.008 --> 04:21.803
Ugh, what is in this?
Dumbbells?

04:23.972 --> 04:26.099
Ugh. Steve.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.185
Lois! Great. You're here.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.687
Huh. Do you need a hand
with that?

04:30.687 --> 04:32.313
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

04:32.313 --> 04:33.564
Uh-huh?

04:33.564 --> 04:35.858
I know. I mean, anything.

04:35.858 --> 04:38.903
You can tell me anything.

04:38.903 --> 04:42.740
I want to talk to you about...

04:42.740 --> 04:47.370
- writing a story with me.
- About Superman?

04:47.370 --> 04:50.873
About the strange tech
weapons that keep popping
up in Metropolis.

04:50.873 --> 04:54.335
I've got an idea
for how to go
about it too, um, uh...

04:54.335 --> 04:56.045
Here, it's easier
if I show you.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.760
Is that a murder board?

05:02.760 --> 05:04.554
I call it
an investigation board.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.347
But, uh, yes.

05:06.347 --> 05:11.019
Livewire's harness,
Intergang's weapons,
Ivo's Parasite suit.

05:11.019 --> 05:14.313
Livewire stole this tech
and unleashed it onto our city.

05:14.313 --> 05:16.983
But someone made these weapons.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.110
I need to find out who that is

05:19.110 --> 05:21.446
before more people get hurt.

05:21.446 --> 05:25.908
And... And there's something
weirdly familiar
about the tech.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.410
Familiar how?

05:27.410 --> 05:28.453
I... I don't know.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.996
I just know this is important.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.707
And then I got this.

05:32.707 --> 05:35.293
One of the <i>Planet's</i>
old dispatch scanners.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.919
Every time the tech weapons
have shown up,

05:36.919 --> 05:38.963
- they've nearly destroyed
part of the city.
- Hmm.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.716
- So if we listen
to the scanner--
- We'll hear any reports

05:41.716 --> 05:43.509
of the weapons
and can investigate.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.095
And find out where
they all really came from.

05:46.095 --> 05:49.140
This is the story
I want to pursue.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.601
And I'd love your help.

05:51.601 --> 05:55.438
Hey, I have an idea.
Let's ask Superman about them.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.190
I don't think he knows
anything about them.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.108
But we won't know
until we talk to him.

05:59.108 --> 06:04.739
Me, you and Superman
in a room together.

06:04.739 --> 06:07.492
At the same time.

06:08.951 --> 06:11.037
"We"? Are you saying yes
to writing this with me?

06:11.037 --> 06:12.288
This is going to be great.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.915
You're the best journalist
I know.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.876
I value your input.
And this really matters to me.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.628
People have been hurt
by these weapons.

06:18.628 --> 06:19.962
You've almost been hurt
by them,

06:19.962 --> 06:21.130
and I won't let that
happen again

06:21.130 --> 06:22.882
because I... I...

06:24.217 --> 06:25.384
I care about you...

06:26.344 --> 06:27.637
Lois.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.472
And I, uh...

06:31.057 --> 06:32.934
I wanted to ask--

06:32.934 --> 06:35.103
<i>All units, reports
of a runaway bus</i>

06:35.103 --> 06:36.187
<i>- on Main Street.</i>
- Oh, I forgot all about
my bagel in the kitchen.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.855
I'll be right back.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.236
<i>All units, disregard.</i>

06:43.236 --> 06:45.279
<i>Superman stopped the bus.</i>

06:45.279 --> 06:46.989
- Where were we?
- <i>All units,</i>

06:46.989 --> 06:49.575
<i>- there's a mugging on 47th.</i>
- Cream cheese!

06:49.575 --> 06:54.831
<i>Disregard previous request.
Superman has it under control.</i>

06:54.831 --> 06:57.041
Okay, new plan.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.503
Hmm.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.630
Okay, the school
of Steve is in session.

07:02.630 --> 07:05.716
And lesson <i>numero uno</i> is that
you've got to be prepared

07:05.716 --> 07:07.677
for the real life
of a reporter.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.220
It's not all glitzy galas.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.972
A lot of it is hitting
the pavement.

07:10.972 --> 07:11.973
The mean streets.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.850
The dark side of the city.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.144
Oh-ho! I got shivers.
Take notes.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.645
Oh, uh, uh-huh.

07:17.645 --> 07:20.314
You know, you remind me
of me at your age.

07:20.314 --> 07:23.025
Plus, you're clearly
the Steve of your group.

07:23.025 --> 07:26.028
What do you mean,
I'm the Steve?

07:26.028 --> 07:27.238
I am not the Steve.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.407
Uh, I know a Steve
when I see one.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.743
Always on the outskirts.
Never really part
of the main group.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.287
A lone wolf.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.164
I am not a lone wolf.

07:36.164 --> 07:41.085
It's Kent, Olsen and Lane,
journalism pals for life!
We're a team.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.004
Oh, my mistake.

07:43.004 --> 07:46.007
So, uh, where were
your other halves this morning?

07:46.007 --> 07:49.802
They... They had things to do
and something about bagels.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.888
But I've got their backs
and they have mine.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.890
Because they listen
to what you say.

07:53.890 --> 07:57.310
Well, Lois thinks my ideas
are weird, but--

07:57.310 --> 08:00.730
Which she tells you,
because there's no secrets
among the three of you.

08:00.730 --> 08:01.898
Hmm.

08:01.898 --> 08:02.857
You're a Steve.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.192
No!

08:04.192 --> 08:06.319
Bruh, being a Steve is great.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.946
We're mavericks,
making our own rules.

08:08.946 --> 08:12.325
Then living by those rules,
which I call the Steve code.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.076
You actually wrote them down?

08:14.076 --> 08:17.496
Why is "never skip leg day"
on here three times?

08:17.496 --> 08:21.584
Lesson <i>numero dos,</i> protege.
Don't question the Steve code.

08:21.584 --> 08:26.380
- I am not--
- Oh, we're here.
Give me a sec.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.842
Clark, I don't know
where you are,

08:29.842 --> 08:32.094
but I need you to call me
with a fake emergency
and get me out of this.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.473
Or answer me at all.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.684
Uh, let's set up here
and get to work.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.354
Ugh, this day
could not get any worse.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.688
So what am I shooting?

08:42.688 --> 08:44.857
Coverage of the stadium?
A practice?

08:44.857 --> 08:46.359
Oh, no, no, no.
You're filming me.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.986
Steve! Steve!
Steve! Steve!

08:48.986 --> 08:50.363
Uh-huh, okay.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.031
Aliens. Mothman.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.449
The Loch Ness monster,

08:53.449 --> 08:56.118
and that one psychic starfish
in Germany,

08:56.118 --> 08:57.745
- Flamebird says it's all real.
- Huh?

08:57.745 --> 09:00.539
But I say, nah!

09:01.332 --> 09:02.208
What?

09:09.632 --> 09:11.884
<i>Disregard backup request.</i>
- Huh?

09:29.819 --> 09:32.989
<i>Sinkhole is under control,
thanks to Superman.</i>

09:32.989 --> 09:35.157
Ugh, this is never
going to work.

09:35.157 --> 09:39.453
<i>Reports of suspicious people
at McGuinness Luxe Garage.</i>

09:41.706 --> 09:43.541
Hmm.

09:43.541 --> 09:46.919
- <i>Be warned, armed
with strange tech weapons.</i>
- Hmm.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.170
Stay safe.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.719
Hold it...

09:55.469 --> 09:57.263
right... there.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.225
Uh, Ms. Lane,
you can't be here.

10:01.225 --> 10:03.227
There's a robbery in progress.

10:03.227 --> 10:07.732
Heard about
the break-in over the scanner

10:07.732 --> 10:11.527
because my good friend
is working on a story

10:11.527 --> 10:15.656
about the tech,
and I came here to help him.

10:15.656 --> 10:18.200
You know Clark Kent, don't you?

10:18.200 --> 10:20.703
Oh, that young man
who works with you
and Mr. Olsen?

10:20.703 --> 10:25.666
He's quiet, but thoughtful,
upstanding. I like him.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.377
Yep, that's him.

10:28.377 --> 10:33.424
Anyhow, Clark really wanted
to talk to you
and track down this tech.

10:33.424 --> 10:38.888
So until Clark can show up
and ask you questions himself,

10:38.888 --> 10:41.057
I'm not letting you out
of my sight.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.353
Superman!

10:45.353 --> 10:47.646
He's already here.
Hit 'em and run.

10:53.736 --> 10:54.653
Unh!

10:57.365 --> 10:58.324
Aah!

11:07.375 --> 11:08.334
Watch out!

11:20.805 --> 11:22.932
Superman, are you okay?

11:22.932 --> 11:25.476
Uh, I'm fine. Just, uh...

11:25.476 --> 11:27.436
Come on, come on.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.438
Why does it need more time?

11:29.438 --> 11:31.399
Her gloves aren't working.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.909
I'm sorry, Superman.

11:41.909 --> 11:44.286
Please don't kidnap me
like the others.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.331
What?

11:49.250 --> 11:50.459
You're Nah?

11:50.459 --> 11:52.002
You're the guy
who's been trolling me?

11:52.002 --> 11:54.296
Wait, you're Flamebird?

11:55.631 --> 11:56.841
Great minds, bruh.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.634
Except you're wrong
about aliens.

11:58.634 --> 12:01.679
This is why I'm the mentor
and you're the student.

12:01.679 --> 12:02.721
Now get my good side.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.432
I had to do voice-over

12:04.432 --> 12:06.308
for the first vids
'cause I didn't have
a camera guy.

12:06.308 --> 12:09.812
Honestly, today is working out
even better than I had hoped.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.647
So let me get this straight.

12:11.647 --> 12:15.484
You dragged me out here
to blow off work
for your video stream?

12:15.484 --> 12:17.736
I thought we had
a real assignment.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.363
Does Mr. White know about this?

12:19.363 --> 12:22.491
Like you kids
do what Perry tells you.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.368
Besides, this is great.

12:24.368 --> 12:25.911
Just me and my protege.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.414
Two lone wolves making videos.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.082
I'm not like you!

12:30.082 --> 12:32.960
Me, Clark, Lois,
we're best friends.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.838
The Three Amigos,
the Three Musketeers.

12:35.838 --> 12:38.549
And when you called them
to help you get out of working
with me,

12:38.549 --> 12:41.510
did they answer you,
young D'Artagnan?

12:41.510 --> 12:45.222
I'm not just a handsome face,
you know. I notice things.

12:45.222 --> 12:48.851
Look, you guys are tight now,
but life goes on.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.979
Things change
and people get left behind.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.690
Take it from me.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.233
That's not
what is happening here.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.319
I mean, sure, Clark's
trying out some new things,

12:58.319 --> 13:02.364
and Lois has her
"find Superman" stuff,
but we're a team.

13:02.364 --> 13:03.866
Are you sure
about that, wolf cub?

13:08.120 --> 13:10.039
Yes, you are wrong.

13:10.039 --> 13:14.543
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a Bigfoot to catch
with my best friends.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.881
Kidnapping?

13:18.881 --> 13:20.049
What are you talking about?

13:20.049 --> 13:21.300
I've got this, Superman.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.928
Okay, listen up, bud.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.513
I hate two things.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.389
Secrets and liars.

13:27.389 --> 13:30.726
So you're going to tell us
everything you know
about that tech

13:30.726 --> 13:32.686
and what you meant
about kidnapping,

13:32.686 --> 13:35.940
or I let my flying friend here
cut loose.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.066
That's not happening.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.817
Then I'll cut loose.

13:38.817 --> 13:41.320
Ms. Lane,
please don't threaten people.
It's wrong.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.405
Fine.

13:43.405 --> 13:47.493
Tell us what you know
or my friend here will worry
excessively about your welfare.

13:47.493 --> 13:48.786
Worry about...

13:48.786 --> 13:50.079
Are you kidding me?

13:50.079 --> 13:51.789
He's the one taking us all.

13:51.789 --> 13:56.043
My crew, members
of the Gazzo family,
bag men, pickpockets.

13:56.043 --> 14:00.005
Every single person who got
tech weapons from that
Livewire lady is gone.

14:00.005 --> 14:03.259
We were trying to lift a ride
to get out of town
before he got us too.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.052
I'm not "getting" anyone.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.178
Why would you think that?

14:06.178 --> 14:07.721
I saw you do it.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.932
We were knocking over
the pawn shop on 25th,

14:09.932 --> 14:13.477
and then there was this blur
and half my crew was gone.

14:13.477 --> 14:16.063
Who else could move that fast?

14:16.063 --> 14:17.940
But I'm not going down easy.

14:24.863 --> 14:28.951
As long as she has that
heatwave weapon,
she's incredibly dangerous.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.369
What do we do now?

14:30.369 --> 14:32.454
First we have to go back
to the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

14:32.454 --> 14:33.497
Come on.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.459
Two targets,
headed in different directions.

14:37.459 --> 14:38.794
What's the priority?

14:38.794 --> 14:40.546
<i>Superman can wait.</i>

14:40.546 --> 14:41.797
<i>Get our tech back.</i>

14:41.797 --> 14:42.881
Roger that.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.885
Okay. What do we do now?

14:46.885 --> 14:48.429
Why did we have
to come back here?

14:48.429 --> 14:51.390
Because it's too dangerous
for you to come with me.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.642
Wait, you're leaving me behind?

14:53.642 --> 14:56.061
I have to stop that woman
before she burns down the city.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.731
You told me before
you don't know
how your powers work.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.191
Do you even know
if you're fireproof?

15:01.191 --> 15:04.528
And you still don't know
who is kidnapping people.

15:04.528 --> 15:05.863
I'm not letting you go.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.200
I'm sorry, Lois,
but I can't let you get hurt.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.660
Stop!

15:11.660 --> 15:14.371
Don't do this. Superman!

15:15.039 --> 15:18.792
Superman! Clark!

15:24.923 --> 15:26.675
You won't get me, Superman.

15:34.808 --> 15:35.643
Huh?

15:45.569 --> 15:47.488
I'm not letting you take me.

15:49.114 --> 15:52.201
I'm not taking anyone.
I just want to help.

15:59.333 --> 16:03.128
I have visual
on the final target
and nemesis Omega.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.588
Permission to engage.

16:04.588 --> 16:07.049
Suit is operating
at optimal efficiency.

16:07.049 --> 16:10.177
Integrating the reclaimed tech
has made it stronger.

16:10.177 --> 16:13.222
General, there will never
be a better time than this.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.099
Permission granted.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.975
Requesting support.

16:16.975 --> 16:18.018
You'll have it.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.019
Mmm.

16:24.733 --> 16:25.776
Huh?

16:34.827 --> 16:35.661
What?

16:37.538 --> 16:38.914
Intergang's freeze ray?

16:39.707 --> 16:40.582
But how?

16:46.839 --> 16:47.881
Who are you?

16:47.881 --> 16:50.092
Oh, that's easy, Superman.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.760
We're the good guys.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.597
Agent Wilson, contain it.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.242
Power fluctuations
are wildly off spec.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.453
The enemy is weaker
than anticipated.

17:17.453 --> 17:20.622
This technology, these...
These weapons, they're yours.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.376
You're the ones
kidnapping people.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.129
He's got
a super brain too.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.384
Why are you doing this?

17:32.384 --> 17:33.677
As if you don't know.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.804
Drop the act, Superman.

17:35.804 --> 17:39.141
There's no one here
to swallow your lies.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.977
You. Who are you?

17:41.977 --> 17:44.396
I'm the one keeping
the Earth safe.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.192
Unh! Aah!

17:48.192 --> 17:49.193
Hit him.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.947
Wait. I don't understand--

17:53.947 --> 17:55.032
Again.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.575
No, I didn't--

17:56.575 --> 17:57.659
Again.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.077
Aah!

17:59.077 --> 17:59.995
Again.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.651
Aah!

18:33.946 --> 18:35.364
- Ha!
- No!

18:42.538 --> 18:43.539
No.

18:43.539 --> 18:46.834
You need to stop.
People need help.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.931
Wilson, take the shot.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.558
No. Stand down, soldier.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.561
General, we have an opportunity
and we need to take it.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.396
Not if it endangers civilians.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.189
Remember why we're doing this.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.567
And when everyone dies
on the next zero day,

19:11.567 --> 19:12.818
will they thank you

19:12.818 --> 19:14.695
for sparing a handful
now? Wilson--

19:14.695 --> 19:17.906
Is this your operation,
Mandy, or is it mine?

19:17.906 --> 19:18.949
Hmm.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.577
Wilson, retreat.

19:23.161 --> 19:25.289
Be seeing you, Superman.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.237
- Lois?
- Clark!

20:02.201 --> 20:03.285
I was so worried.

20:04.369 --> 20:05.203
You're hurt.

20:05.203 --> 20:06.455
Oh, that's from shaving.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.789
But there's no need
to be worried.

20:07.789 --> 20:10.792
I just went home for a...
To water plants.

20:13.086 --> 20:17.090
Don't. Don't lie to me again.

20:17.090 --> 20:19.092
What are you talking about?

20:19.092 --> 20:22.804
I've spent all this time
worrying about you

20:22.804 --> 20:26.224
and this is how you're going
to play it?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.727
Play what?

20:28.727 --> 20:29.770
Fine.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.607
We'll do this the hard way.

20:35.734 --> 20:36.693
Lois!

20:42.032 --> 20:43.241
I knew it!

20:48.705 --> 20:50.749
Lois, please let me explain.

20:50.749 --> 20:53.377
You lied to me, Superman.

20:53.377 --> 20:54.628
I didn't lie to you.

20:54.628 --> 20:55.963
I just didn't
tell you everything.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.048
A secret is
another type of lie.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.842
Lois, you have no idea
what's going on in this city
right now.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.010
Then tell me.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.220
You hated Superman.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.846
You said he was a liar

21:04.846 --> 21:06.848
and you were going to find
and publish all of his secrets.

21:06.848 --> 21:08.392
My secrets.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.519
I would never do that to you.

21:10.519 --> 21:13.647
I had no idea it was you
until after the gala.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.023
How could you think that?

21:15.023 --> 21:16.817
You jumped off a roof!

21:16.817 --> 21:18.485
I don't know what to think.

21:18.485 --> 21:21.113
You kept this from me
and I'm your...

21:23.156 --> 21:27.536
I don't know what we were going
to be, but that's all over now.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.583
<i>It's Lois.
Leave a message or text</i>

21:33.583 --> 21:35.043
<i>if you've got a tip
on Superman.</i>

21:37.546 --> 21:40.549
<i>Hello.
You've reached Clark Kent.</i>

21:40.549 --> 21:42.926
<i>Leave a message
after the--</i>

21:42.926 --> 21:46.930
Fine. Who needs them anyway?

21:55.272 --> 21:56.857
Huh.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.403
Aah!
