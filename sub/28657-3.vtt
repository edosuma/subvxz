00:02.760 --> 00:05.399
You will find out their names, the
guests.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.879
Find out who they are.

00:06.880 --> 00:10.426
But don't do it obviously,
Mr Petrukhin.

00:11.040 --> 00:12.959
Be careful.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.719
Mr Petrukhin, there you are!

00:33.720 --> 00:36.319
So glad you could join us.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.199
Quite a throng, isn't it?

00:38.200 --> 00:41.109
Now, who can I introduce you to?

00:41.773 --> 00:44.592
- Arthur, a moment?
- Sorry.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.959
There you are, Mr Petrukhin.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.119
I'm so pleased you could come.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.999
But you're all alone!
Where's your wife?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.759
She wasn't able to come.

00:54.760 --> 00:56.479
Well, that is a pity.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.639
Kathleen! We must go and see...

00:58.640 --> 01:00.079
Yes. Excuse me.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.720
- But, yes.
- Excuse me.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.680
Good evening.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.519
It's quite a turnout!

01:14.520 --> 01:17.119
You must excuse me -
I've taken my hearing aid out,

01:17.120 --> 01:20.919
so you'll really have to shout,
Mr Petrukhin.

01:20.920 --> 01:24.199
I was just wondering
who some of these people are!

01:24.200 --> 01:28.719
- Who's that, for instance?
- I know none of their names, I'm afraid.

01:28.720 --> 01:31.679
Almost nobody, not any more.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.919
- How about you, Walter?
- So few nowadays, so few.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.079
How about him?

01:37.080 --> 01:40.999
I do remember him, as it happens,

01:41.000 --> 01:42.399
because he's American.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.159
A Mr Ottley,

01:44.160 --> 01:49.519
and he has a friend
who is also American, a Mr Durkin.

01:49.520 --> 01:52.080
Ottley and Durkin.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.679
- Mr Durkin?
- Yes?

01:56.680 --> 01:58.999
Mr Durkin, your name was mentioned
to me.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.759
It was, was it?

02:00.760 --> 02:02.559
In what context?

02:02.560 --> 02:04.879
No, no, no context.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.758
I was just asking who
some of these guests were.

02:07.759 --> 02:11.159
- Haven't been to one of these parties before.
- First time?

02:11.160 --> 02:12.479
Yes.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.844
What do you do, Mr Durkin?

02:15.400 --> 02:16.879
What do I do?

02:16.880 --> 02:18.971
I used to be a dentist.

02:19.480 --> 02:20.559
Used to be?

02:20.560 --> 02:24.279
- Sometimes I still am.
- The food is up, everyone.

02:24.280 --> 02:28.644
Time to get to the trough!
The buffet awaits you.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.679
So you met the dentist?

02:33.680 --> 02:35.919
Yes, I introduced myself.

02:35.920 --> 02:40.648
Terrifying, isn't he?
Both a dentist and an American.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.279
By the way, do you like fishing?

02:43.280 --> 02:45.119
Fishing? Yes?

02:45.120 --> 02:48.279
Er... Sometimes, I fish.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.879
Well, that's good, because we have
our annual fishing party very soon.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.840
You must come!

02:56.800 --> 02:59.519
How's our Russian friend?

02:59.520 --> 03:03.248
He was asking who everyone was.

03:12.040 --> 03:14.279
Hard to choose!

03:14.280 --> 03:17.280
I find I never have that problem.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.479
It's lucky it's the one night
you don't have a party, isn't it?

03:25.480 --> 03:26.799
So you can keep me company.

03:26.800 --> 03:30.039
Yes, Mum. I'd much rather be here
than at a party, though.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.079
But you're managing so well.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.479
Doing the season.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.919
And you see, it's not such an
ordeal, is it?

03:35.920 --> 03:37.959
Not always.

03:37.960 --> 03:41.119
- And you've made some friends?
- Friends?

03:41.120 --> 03:43.359
With some of those people?

03:43.360 --> 03:47.179
But you must've made some friends,
darling?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.439
I'm not a spy.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.986
I don't know how to do this!

04:16.680 --> 04:18.720
Excuse me.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.399
Hello.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.399
Hello?

04:26.400 --> 04:28.839
Hello. Is anybody there?

04:28.840 --> 04:31.750
Yes, yes. I'm here. Who is this?

04:32.320 --> 04:34.399
FAINTLY Hello, are you still
there?

04:34.400 --> 04:38.128
Hello. Yes. Who is this? W-Who's
speaking?

04:38.760 --> 04:41.600
FAINTLY Hello? Hello?

04:42.840 --> 04:44.399
Is that...?

04:44.400 --> 04:45.959
Is that you, Anthony?

04:45.960 --> 04:47.319
FAINTLY Hello?

04:47.320 --> 04:49.775
Anthony?

04:55.800 --> 04:58.519
FAINTLY Hello? Are you there?

04:58.520 --> 05:01.430
LESS FAINT This is Paul Ledbury.

05:02.360 --> 05:03.520
Paul!

05:04.600 --> 05:06.039
Yes. Yes, I'm here.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.479
I gathered you were asking my
mother about me and Anthony.

05:09.480 --> 05:12.079
I'm afraid I have no new
information, no news.

05:12.080 --> 05:15.717
I would of course have told you if I
had.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.279
Mrs Shaw?

05:19.280 --> 05:21.099
Are you still there?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.559
Yes. Yes, I'm here.
Just hearing your voice,

05:24.560 --> 05:26.833
I didn't know who it was.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.759
Can I see you, Paul?

05:29.760 --> 05:31.639
Paul, just to talk about Anthony.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.839
Just in case you think of something
I haven't,

05:33.840 --> 05:37.479
or in case there's another avenue
I could follow...

05:37.480 --> 05:39.399
I'm still in the South of France.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.839
When I'm back in London,
I'll give you a call.

05:41.840 --> 05:45.560
- You will, Paul?
- Yes.

06:04.640 --> 06:07.879
Mrs Shaw? What's happened?

06:10.920 --> 06:13.239
I'm... I'm so sorry.

06:13.240 --> 06:16.479
It was just a phone call.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.679
I made a mistake, but it's all been
straightened out now.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.799
Can I do anything?

06:21.800 --> 06:24.159
No. No, you can't.

06:24.160 --> 06:26.559
You're very kind, but it's all over
now.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.599
Who was it on the phone who upset
you?

06:28.600 --> 06:31.279
Who was on the telephone? That's a
private matter, Mr Petrukhin.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.719
I'm sorry. I wasn't prying,
I really wasn't.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.159
I-I just thought, for something
to upset you that much...

06:36.160 --> 06:39.959
It was just a misunderstanding.
It's all been corrected.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.415
Thank you for your concern.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.008
You see, it's gone.

06:54.560 --> 06:59.200
Mr Petrukhin!
Where is Mr Samuel Petrukhin?

07:00.440 --> 07:04.159
There you are.
We couldn't find you!

07:04.160 --> 07:06.159
Yes. What did you want?

07:06.160 --> 07:08.599
I just wanted to show everybody
your invention.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.999
Your portable bellboy.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.319
Your people's locator.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.959
You have one on you, do you? I seem
to remember you say you always carry one?

07:15.960 --> 07:18.839
Yes, I do. I have one here.

07:18.840 --> 07:21.159
So, here it is.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.888
You carry it on your person...

07:24.400 --> 07:27.079
and if somebody wants you, it
bleeps.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.119
You could be in the farthest corner
of Whitehall,

07:30.120 --> 07:34.759
or in the deepest basement in the Houses
of Parliament, and it still finds you.

07:34.760 --> 07:38.400
A most intriguing invention, is it
not?

07:39.720 --> 07:42.993
This gentleman is full of surprises.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.240
A man of the future.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.779
You're very talkative, my dear!

07:55.600 --> 07:57.919
Didn't anything happen at the party
last night?

07:57.920 --> 08:00.040
No, no.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.079
It's just the anniversary.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.479
Of Anthony. Of him going. Today.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.040
Yes, so it is.

08:09.960 --> 08:13.679
Anniversaries nearly always make one
feel awful, don't they?

08:13.680 --> 08:17.399
When you get to my age, my dear,

08:17.400 --> 08:21.946
you dream about the past a lot.
Nearly every night.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.799
One is suddenly young again

08:23.800 --> 08:27.919
and at some terrible dinner party
with one's parents,

08:27.920 --> 08:30.599
or watching some of the
gawky young men

08:30.600 --> 08:34.559
one was fond of going off to war.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.159
Of course it's difficult, my dear.

08:39.159 --> 08:41.342
It doesn't get any less.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.640
Mummy!

08:49.840 --> 08:51.720
Mummy...

08:52.880 --> 08:54.280
Mummy!

08:55.560 --> 08:58.197
Just ten more minutes, Mummy.

09:06.880 --> 09:11.335
There you are!
You've caught me being so lazy.

09:17.720 --> 09:20.479
Rather smudged and rather short,
isn't it?

09:20.480 --> 09:22.719
Well, what do you expect?
I've never done this before.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.599
We expected some more names.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.639
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm not a spy!

09:26.640 --> 09:28.999
I've never tried spying on anybody
before.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.479
I've had no training,

09:30.480 --> 09:31.879
I go to this party,

09:31.880 --> 09:35.519
I'm supposed to memorise everybody's
name somehow, magically. Well, I didn't.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.279
No, Guy. You're too near the sofa.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.079
Over by the bin, go on.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.319
By the bin!

09:42.320 --> 09:45.279
Now!

09:45.280 --> 09:47.279
He's a very obedient dog.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.479
And he has rather a large
vocabulary, in fact.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.844
Maybe you should send him.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.599
We will need to ask you to go back.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.439
Yes, once more, Mr Petrukhin.

09:57.440 --> 10:00.839
And then we'll be able to
concentrate on the staff locator

10:00.840 --> 10:03.999
and getting the relevant Government
departments to put in an order.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.919
So one is dependent on the other?
You're blackmailing me, in fact.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.439
No, we are not.

10:08.440 --> 10:11.679
But it will certainly help getting
the orders flowing

10:11.680 --> 10:14.679
if you agree to go back one more
time.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.999
No, I'm sorry.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.364
I will not be blackmailed.
I will not do business like this.

10:22.840 --> 10:25.000
Goodbye, gentlemen.

10:26.080 --> 10:29.535
I've brought something for you,
Hannah.

10:29.960 --> 10:35.324
These are a little reminder
of our memorable night together.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.599
You did these?

10:41.600 --> 10:43.000
I did.

10:44.880 --> 10:48.079
You draw very well.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.319
Blimey! Writing, drawing, dancing,

10:51.320 --> 10:52.959
you do everything, Nicholas!

10:52.960 --> 10:56.599
And I hardly make
any money out of any of it.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.319
It was frightening, wasn't it?

10:58.320 --> 11:01.559
Even though one knew it wasn't real.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.479
There were moments when I thought
I'm not going to get out of this alive.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.399
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have got you involved.
- No, no.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.239
I lie awake at night thinking about
bombs and rockets.

11:10.240 --> 11:14.679
- I might as well get really scared.
- Well, that's how I drew you.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.399
- Looking petrified!
- No!

11:16.400 --> 11:20.219
Determined to survive,
to get out of there!

11:22.040 --> 11:25.519
Before the show, I've got something
to tell you, Hannah.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.199
I'm going away for a few weeks,

11:28.200 --> 11:29.919
maybe even months, to Italy.

11:29.920 --> 11:35.102
To try to write. Somebody's offered
me a room in Florence.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.440
You're going away?

11:38.440 --> 11:41.879
You bring me these, and then you
tell me you're going away?

11:41.880 --> 11:44.359
- You're almost my only friend, Nicholas!
- That can't be true.

11:44.360 --> 11:48.439
- It is true.
- How do I survive the summer now?

11:48.440 --> 11:51.639
That is the most shocking thing,
Courtney.

11:51.640 --> 11:54.519
It was meant to be shocking.
We needed to shock you.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.918
We're going bust?
Is that what you're saying?

11:56.919 --> 11:58.985
There's a real chance
of us going bankrupt?

11:58.986 --> 12:01.519
Unless we get some orders
in the next few weeks, yes.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.999
We're being undercut all the time
on the hearing aids by the competition.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.719
The cheap ones don't last!
They have no volume control!

12:07.720 --> 12:11.279
- They're inferior in every way!
- And the bleeper's not taking off.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.639
The military have not come through
with their order.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.959
They will.
It's the best idea we've ever had!

12:15.960 --> 12:19.479
Of course. But we can't just wait
for the world to catch up with us.

12:19.480 --> 12:22.641
And we're going to have to take
some immediate action, starting today.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.519
Action?

12:24.520 --> 12:27.599
We're going to have to sack some
staff.

12:27.600 --> 12:31.239
Doreen is selecting them now,
by length of service.

12:31.240 --> 12:35.513
We're having financial problems
at the moment...

12:46.160 --> 12:48.119
These are the people who are leaving
us.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.079
I told them you'd address them,
Mr Samuel,

12:50.080 --> 12:52.159
but if you prefer, Courtney can do
it.

12:52.160 --> 12:56.979
No. No, if anyone's got to do this,
it's got to be me.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.319
I have some bad news.

13:05.320 --> 13:10.479
News that cannot... It cannot be
kept from you any longer.

13:10.480 --> 13:15.519
I have to tell you that we have had
a turbulent few months,

13:15.520 --> 13:18.319
and I know that there have
been some rumours

13:18.320 --> 13:21.230
about job losses flying about...

13:24.240 --> 13:26.280
but rest assured...

13:27.720 --> 13:29.999
we will find a way.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.479
I will find a way through this...

13:35.800 --> 13:39.164
and we will overcome our problems.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.639
Now let's get back to work!

13:42.640 --> 13:45.279
We have to do it, Mr Samuel.

13:45.280 --> 13:49.099
We're not going to do this today,
Courtney.

14:00.280 --> 14:03.559
Everybody's looking very serious for
a Friday night.

14:03.560 --> 14:05.640
What's happened?

14:08.760 --> 14:10.159
A little trouble with the orders.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.680
It's nothing.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.279
It'll be solved very soon.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.400
Good.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.959
What are you doing here?

14:19.960 --> 14:21.959
I just thought I'd drop by.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.720
I came to see you.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.640
Why not?

14:28.800 --> 14:30.759
I thought we could have a little
drink together.

14:30.760 --> 14:33.999
And I need your address, Esther,

14:34.000 --> 14:36.399
because I'm going to start
bombarding you with letters,

14:36.400 --> 14:38.040
if that's OK.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.919
Petrukhin!

14:46.920 --> 14:49.000
I need you, Petrukhin.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.399
Here he is, the little Petrukhin.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.999
He certainly keeps us on our toes.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.839
I'm constantly having to confiscate
his father's inventions.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.039
- Hello, Sasha.
- Mrs Shaw.

15:02.040 --> 15:05.799
I will be over there... if you need
me.

15:05.800 --> 15:09.359
And if there's anything
I can do on the other matter,

15:09.360 --> 15:11.280
I'll be in touch.

15:13.320 --> 15:15.879
I'm so sorry appearing unannounced,
Sasha.

15:15.880 --> 15:19.399
I brought you some things -
some jam and some ginger cake.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.679
I hope you like them.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.959
I just guessed.

15:22.960 --> 15:26.439
It's so very kind of you to come
and visit me, Mrs Shaw.

15:26.440 --> 15:29.359
It's not kind at all.

15:29.360 --> 15:32.542
I have a confession to make, Sasha.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.146
I'm here for another reason.

15:36.680 --> 15:40.839
My son Anthony used to
be at this school.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.919
Did Hannah tell you about Anthony?

15:42.920 --> 15:46.559
Well, if I tell you, will you make
sure you don't tell anyone else?

15:46.560 --> 15:49.519
Your father doesn't know about this.

15:49.520 --> 15:52.719
Anthony disappeared the day after
his 21st birthday,

15:52.720 --> 15:57.079
a few years ago, and nobody's seen
him since or heard of him.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.719
And sometimes I come here,

15:59.720 --> 16:02.519
just in case he's been in touch
with any of his old teachers,

16:02.520 --> 16:06.039
or if they've heard about him
from any of the old boys.

16:06.040 --> 16:09.759
Some tiny piece of new information.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.919
But of course no-one's been able
to tell me anything.

16:12.920 --> 16:16.719
But then some people are very good
at keeping secrets, aren't they,

16:16.720 --> 16:21.119
- however many times you ask?
- Yes.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.639
Sometimes I want to go through
the whole of this place.

16:23.640 --> 16:26.239
I want turn the school upside down,

16:26.240 --> 16:28.359
just in case there's something
there.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.280
A clue.

16:31.520 --> 16:35.248
But of course, that's not possible,
is it?

16:36.640 --> 16:40.560
Anyway, it's lovely to see you
again, Sasha.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.599
Now, I mustn't keep you from your
class now, Sasha.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.559
Yes.

16:51.560 --> 16:55.599
Maybe I could ask someone?
Maybe I could find something out?

16:55.600 --> 17:00.691
Absolutely not. I don't want to get
you into any trouble.

17:18.160 --> 17:19.178
What are you doing here?

17:19.179 --> 17:21.719
They asked me to arrive
a little bit earlier than you.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.559
Mr Johnson was just showing us

17:23.560 --> 17:27.239
what's involved in installing your
pager system at a military base.

17:27.240 --> 17:30.359
Yes, I've shown them what's required.
Given them some cost estimates.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.079
We told you we'd get round to it,
didn't we?

17:32.080 --> 17:34.239
You never mentioned to me
that you were coming here.

17:34.240 --> 17:37.959
Well, I only got the call today.
They said come as soon as you can.

17:37.960 --> 17:42.688
- So I did.
- I think you and I need a word together.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.839
You were discussing business
arrangements without me being present!

17:45.840 --> 17:47.159
We were, yes.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.839
I wanted you to realise

17:48.840 --> 17:52.959
that we are very serious
about your invention, Mr Petrukhin,

17:52.960 --> 17:56.239
because you're so suspicious.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.479
Do you believe me?

17:57.480 --> 18:00.919
Maybe. We'll see.

18:00.920 --> 18:03.839
So you've come here to tell me
you're willing to cooperate?

18:03.840 --> 18:07.039
- You're going to go back?
- Just one more time, yes,

18:07.040 --> 18:10.919
if you really are placing
an order for the pager.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.519
You've received another invitation
from the Shaws, have you?

18:13.520 --> 18:15.959
Yes. To go to a fishing party.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.919
Fishing.

18:17.920 --> 18:21.119
Now that's perfect.
I rather hoped it would be that.

18:21.120 --> 18:24.393
Now, I have a little present for
you.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.879
What is it?

18:26.880 --> 18:28.800
It's just a camera.

18:31.640 --> 18:32.839
You see?

18:32.840 --> 18:35.079
Nothing to be alarmed about.

18:35.080 --> 18:38.679
I want you to photograph all the
guests

18:38.680 --> 18:41.679
that turn up at this fishing party,
as many as you can.

18:41.680 --> 18:45.599
Tell them photography is a hobby
of yours, make it seem natural.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.159
Make it natural? That's impossible.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.119
And there's one thing to remember
about this particular camera.

18:51.120 --> 18:54.879
It has a very powerful zoom lens,

18:54.880 --> 18:58.325
stronger than anything
on the market at the moment.

18:58.326 --> 19:02.759
So it's best not to let any of the
other guests borrow it, for any reason.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.719
Why don't you give me an ordinary camera?

19:04.720 --> 19:06.239
Wouldn't that be less suspicious?

19:06.240 --> 19:08.839
And there's also this as well,

19:08.840 --> 19:12.750
but best only to use this
when you're alone.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.039
Take your wife with you,
make a day trip of it.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.799
- Font color= "#00ffff" >My wife won't go back there.
- Then take your daughter.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.119
It has to seem like a nice
family day out.

19:20.120 --> 19:23.285
My daughter! Take her into the middle
of these people who you suspect of...

19:23.286 --> 19:25.601
I don't know what,
because you won't tell me.

19:25.602 --> 19:30.679
- Take her there?
- She will be perfectly safe, I promise.

19:30.680 --> 19:33.359
- I can guarantee.
- And me?

19:33.360 --> 19:35.839
- And you?
- Am I in any danger?

19:35.840 --> 19:38.639
- Not at the fishing party, you're not.
- But afterwards?

19:38.640 --> 19:40.799
You told me it was best
that I didn't know anything,

19:40.800 --> 19:44.399
so it sounds as if I'm in some sort
of danger if they work out what I'm doing?

19:44.400 --> 19:47.679
- But they won't.
- How do you know that?

19:47.680 --> 19:49.919
Because it's not hugely
likely anyone

19:49.920 --> 19:52.960
would use you as a spy, is it?

19:57.320 --> 19:59.159
We're late!

19:59.160 --> 20:03.251
I didn't realise we had to arrive
so promptly.

20:05.400 --> 20:06.959
We seem to be very late!

20:06.960 --> 20:08.719
It is a competition.

20:08.720 --> 20:13.359
It's all deadly serious.
It began at noon precisely,

20:13.360 --> 20:17.179
so I expect you'll be fined
for being late.

20:22.560 --> 20:27.239
Mr Petrukhin!
We thought you were never coming!

20:27.240 --> 20:29.679
I had no idea it was a real
competition.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.919
No chance of me winning now, is
there?

20:31.920 --> 20:35.439
It seems unlikely this time,
but you never know.

20:35.440 --> 20:38.639
You may have a magic touch
to charm the fish.

20:38.640 --> 20:42.640
They may all head straight
towards your line!

20:45.800 --> 20:47.079
Come on, Hannah.

20:47.080 --> 20:53.626
You're not so mad about fishing, are
you, that you can't come for a walk?

20:57.360 --> 21:01.519
So, how are you enjoying the summer,
Hannah, all these parties?

21:01.520 --> 21:05.399
Don't ask, please.
If I start, I'll never stop!

21:05.400 --> 21:08.479
- Did you have to do the season?
- I did.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.439
So you know all about it.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.239
I do.

21:12.240 --> 21:15.439
My father wants me to marry
an aristocrat,

21:15.440 --> 21:17.986
that's what he really wants.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.399
The last thing I'm going to do
is complain to you,

21:26.400 --> 21:30.199
because my problems must seem
so really trivial compared to...

21:30.200 --> 21:33.799
compared to you,
and not knowing about Anthony.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.719
Is there any sort of news?

21:35.720 --> 21:37.599
No.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.759
But thank you for asking.

21:39.760 --> 21:42.839
But I have been very busy thinking
and...

21:42.840 --> 21:44.159
Trying to find a new lead?

21:44.160 --> 21:46.888
And trying to find a new lead.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.919
I know it must seem strange,
us having all these parties

21:49.920 --> 21:52.648
when our son's missing, but...

21:53.640 --> 21:55.822
It is strange, isn't it?

22:05.240 --> 22:07.519
You're father is taking pictures of
us, Hannah.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.066
So he is.

22:09.960 --> 22:14.039
But he's miles away!
We'll just be tiny dots!

22:14.040 --> 22:16.359
It's funny,

22:16.360 --> 22:20.239
he's never been much interested
in taking pictures before.

22:20.240 --> 22:23.959
Would you like either of us
to take your picture, Mr Petrukhin?

22:23.960 --> 22:28.439
Absolutely! Let me take a snap of
you.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.599
Something to remember the day by,
Show your wife.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.359
Now, come on, I expect I can manage
it!

22:34.360 --> 22:37.724
We must do that, but in just a
minute.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.599
Those two are always together.

22:40.600 --> 22:44.199
Richard is Arthur's golden boy.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.879
It's been like that for years.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.439
All these important men!

22:49.440 --> 22:52.599
I bet they're just thinking
of young women,

22:52.600 --> 22:54.800
all their old conquests.

22:56.880 --> 22:59.999
They all seem to be going somewhere.
Where are they going?

23:00.000 --> 23:01.999
For a drink or a gossip,
no doubt.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.079
Cigars in the woods.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.679
What about the competition?

23:05.680 --> 23:08.760
The rules are complicated.

23:56.520 --> 24:01.639
My friend, what a splendid-looking
camera you have there!

24:01.640 --> 24:03.919
Yes, it is, isn't it?

24:03.920 --> 24:06.479
The inner sanctum.

24:06.480 --> 24:10.719
The really obsessive fishermen
gather together to work out how to win

24:10.720 --> 24:13.639
because they're fishing in teams
as well as for themselves.

24:13.640 --> 24:16.199
But we don't care about them, do we?

24:16.200 --> 24:18.759
Funny old fishing competition, isn't
it?

24:18.760 --> 24:21.639
Everybody taking it so seriously.

24:21.640 --> 24:26.639
Some of these people did really
important things during the war,

24:26.640 --> 24:31.639
and now a lot of them seem
so stupefyingly dull, don't they?

24:31.640 --> 24:34.079
Maybe that's how I appear to people,
really.

24:34.080 --> 24:36.319
No, absolutely not!

24:36.320 --> 24:37.559
Thanks.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.719
War makes one's thoughts so simple,

24:40.720 --> 24:43.799
so uninteresting.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.719
Somehow I've managed to grow
an imagination afterwards.

24:46.720 --> 24:51.959
I'm going to show you
a secret in the woods, Samuel.

24:51.960 --> 24:53.679
Not what you expected, is it?

24:53.680 --> 24:54.999
It certainly is not.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.479
I love this vehicle,
rusty though she is!

24:58.480 --> 25:03.239
She has her hidden charms,
you'll see.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.280
Climb aboard.

25:14.440 --> 25:17.512
I trust you won't give away
our little secret?

25:17.513 --> 25:18.932
Of course not.

25:18.934 --> 25:23.822
I come here often, Samuel.
It's my favourite place.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.775
I used to come here with...

25:27.320 --> 25:29.593
with a friend of mine.

25:30.480 --> 25:33.199
We had some very happy times here.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.319
Lord Wallington has caught a pike!

25:35.320 --> 25:41.039
He won't give up without a fight!
The king of fishes!

25:41.040 --> 25:46.677
Let's see if the old girl still has
some life in her, shall we?

25:47.400 --> 25:49.959
It starts first time,
that's very impressive!

25:49.960 --> 25:53.142
Come on, we'll take her for a spin!

26:00.840 --> 26:04.799
No idea why I love the old girl so
much,

26:04.800 --> 26:07.039
but she never lets me down!

26:07.040 --> 26:09.479
And there's something amazingly
satisfying

26:09.480 --> 26:11.935
about giving her an outing.

26:25.240 --> 26:28.719
Shall we see which one
of them floats? Who shall we pick?

26:28.720 --> 26:31.599
Which one of the generals
or the others floats?

26:31.600 --> 26:34.600
Who is going to be the lucky one?

26:35.080 --> 26:37.319
- What?!
- Whatever happens,

26:37.320 --> 26:39.775
everything's under control!

26:46.960 --> 26:48.280
Bravo!

26:52.120 --> 26:55.484
Well, that woke you all up, didn't
it?

26:57.400 --> 27:00.119
What a beautiful fish, isn't it?

27:00.120 --> 27:01.879
It's a beautiful angry fish.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.239
Yes, it is.

27:03.240 --> 27:05.119
Are you going to cook it yourself?

27:05.120 --> 27:08.519
Yes, Hannah. Don't look so
surprised!

27:08.520 --> 27:11.679
I used to do lots of cooking
in this house.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.839
Not done so much recently.

27:13.840 --> 27:18.399
So, how are you going to survive
the rest of the season?

27:18.400 --> 27:21.319
By skipping most of the balls.

27:21.320 --> 27:24.079
And telling a lot of lies,
I'm afraid.

27:24.080 --> 27:26.399
I've managed to get away with it so
far.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.679
But I will have to go
to the Queen Charlotte's Ball.

27:28.680 --> 27:31.771
Yes, I remember it well.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.639
I've just had an incredible idea,
Mrs Shaw.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.759
That sounds exciting, Hannah.

27:36.760 --> 27:40.119
At some of the grander balls,
there are these older people there,

27:40.120 --> 27:43.119
sitting around the edge of the room,
like chaperones.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.239
You wouldn't...

27:45.240 --> 27:48.079
You couldn't come with me,
would you?

27:48.080 --> 27:49.959
To the Queen Charlotte's Ball?

27:49.960 --> 27:52.199
It'd make it so much more bearable.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.399
So you want me to come and sit

27:54.400 --> 27:56.755
with all the old dowagers,
do you, Hannah?

27:56.756 --> 27:58.559
No, no, that's not what I...

27:58.560 --> 28:01.919
It does sound like an incredible
idea.

28:01.920 --> 28:05.739
But I'm not sure
it's going to be possible.

28:06.680 --> 28:09.479
It's nice to see a young
person in this house again,

28:09.480 --> 28:12.040
isn't it?

28:15.960 --> 28:18.919
Mr Petrukhin!

28:18.920 --> 28:21.920
Come, come and help me feed them.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.119
Kakoye zamechatel'noye sushchestvo.

28:26.120 --> 28:29.679
It roughly translates as,
"What a splendid little chap."

28:29.680 --> 28:35.044
Yes, it's strange how calm
these animals make one, isn't it?

28:36.520 --> 28:40.679
Very necessary at the moment,
isn't it, Mr Petrukhin?

28:40.680 --> 28:42.479
What are you referring to?

28:42.480 --> 28:44.999
Well, both our work, of course.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.359
One always worries about work,
doesn't one?

28:48.360 --> 28:51.639
And also maybe the threat of nuclear
annihilation at any moment.

28:51.640 --> 28:54.479
Little bit troubling, isn't it?

28:54.480 --> 28:58.199
And whether the Russians
will take over the rest of Europe.

28:58.200 --> 29:02.039
And suddenly, there's another
massive army across the Channel.

29:02.040 --> 29:05.079
It won't happen. The Americans would
never allow it, for a start,

29:05.080 --> 29:07.559
and the Russians
don't want to conquer Europe.

29:07.560 --> 29:10.799
Of course, being Russian, you'd know
that.

29:10.800 --> 29:13.799
Well, I have no special knowledge
any more than anybody else,

29:13.800 --> 29:15.159
but that's what I believe.

29:15.160 --> 29:19.079
You're a man of wide interests,
Mr Petrukhin.

29:19.080 --> 29:22.239
The bleeper machine,
photography, fishing,

29:22.240 --> 29:25.719
deaf people, wine,
space satellites...

29:25.720 --> 29:28.639
There's no limit to what you know.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.640
I like that very much.

29:37.240 --> 29:38.439
Come in.

29:38.440 --> 29:40.399
Petrukhin, what can we do for
you?

29:40.400 --> 29:44.219
I was just giving this to Mr
Tezler.

29:45.320 --> 29:47.439
Petrukhin's handwriting is very
poor.

29:47.440 --> 29:51.079
I asked him to write out
his whole essay again.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.399
It's a small improvement, yes.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.679
But your spelling, Petrukhin,

29:55.680 --> 29:58.399
what are we going to do
about your spelling?

29:58.400 --> 30:00.999
Make it better. I will get better.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.091
Good answer. Well said, Petrukhin.

30:08.880 --> 30:12.079
Is there anything else
we can help you with?

30:12.080 --> 30:14.839
No, I was... I was...

30:14.840 --> 30:19.931
Looking at our filing system?
One day you'll be up there.

30:23.360 --> 30:25.319
Please, will you get up?

30:25.320 --> 30:27.799
Your mother and I want to talk to
you.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.159
Is anything the matter, Dad?

30:29.160 --> 30:31.760
I will see you downstairs.

30:35.756 --> 30:36.936
What, is it?

30:36.938 --> 30:39.319
Your father and I have
received a letter.

30:39.320 --> 30:41.279
- Who from?
- It isn't signed.

30:41.280 --> 30:43.479
You're taking an anonymous letter
seriously?

30:43.480 --> 30:45.799
- You don't know what it says yet.
- What does it say?

30:45.800 --> 30:47.619
It says you were never
received by the Queen,

30:47.620 --> 30:49.119
you arrived late
and were locked out.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.439
And that you've been skipping

30:50.440 --> 30:53.199
many of the balls and parties
that you've been invited to since,

30:53.200 --> 30:55.239
and you've been sitting in cafes

30:55.240 --> 30:58.059
until it was time to come home.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.799
It looks like it was written
by a six-year-old.

31:09.800 --> 31:14.999
Is it true what it says?
And don't lie to us, Hannah. Is it true?

31:15.000 --> 31:18.999
- Some of it is true.
- I told you not to lie.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.182
It's all true, isn't it?

31:21.440 --> 31:23.000
Yes.

31:24.520 --> 31:25.759
Why didn't you tell us?

31:25.760 --> 31:28.159
Anybody can have an accident,
you broke your shoe...

31:28.160 --> 31:30.159
You should never have got
out of the car in the first place.

31:30.160 --> 31:33.199
But then you've told so many lies afterwards,
all those parties you pretended to go to.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.879
- I've been to some of them.
- You've lied to us consistently,

31:35.880 --> 31:38.079
and I will not tolerate that in a
child of mine.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.999
So what are you going to do?

31:40.000 --> 31:42.799
Frogmarch me to these parties?
Get the police to escort me there?

31:42.800 --> 31:46.079
Hannah, we need to talk about this
sensibly, calmly, not to upset each other,

31:46.080 --> 31:50.079
because your father has a very important meeting
today. There's always an important meeting!

31:50.080 --> 31:52.359
- She's determined to upset us.
- I never wanted to do this,

31:52.360 --> 31:56.479
the bloody season. You know that.
But I did it because you wanted me to,

31:56.480 --> 31:58.599
because you said it would mean
so much to Mum.

31:58.600 --> 31:59.652
But it's your future, too!

31:59.653 --> 32:01.639
My future?
You think my future has got anything

32:01.640 --> 32:04.079
to do with those idiotic men that
turn up to these parties?

32:04.080 --> 32:05.719
You don't know that they're idiotic!

32:05.720 --> 32:07.639
That is a particularly
stupid thing to say

32:07.640 --> 32:09.239
since you have been skipping them!

32:09.240 --> 32:12.376
Most young women would give anything
to be in the position that you are in.

32:12.377 --> 32:17.679
Well, then, let them take my place!
I don't belong there, I really don't.

32:17.680 --> 32:21.119
I'm not amazed by all these rich
people and their big houses

32:21.120 --> 32:24.119
and their titles like you are,
all their furniture and their cars and...

32:24.120 --> 32:26.999
- Don't you talk to me like that, Hannah!
- Well, it's true.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.599
That's the life you've always
wanted, isn't it?

32:29.600 --> 32:31.959
It's not my fault you haven't got
it!

32:31.960 --> 32:34.639
And now you want me to marry into
it.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.839
Well, it's not what I want.

32:36.840 --> 32:39.439
And I will not be made
to feel a criminal by you,

32:39.440 --> 32:42.986
because I've done nothing wrong,
at all!

32:58.600 --> 33:01.199
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm going to stay with a friend.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.079
Just for one night. OK?

33:03.080 --> 33:04.131
Which friend?

33:04.132 --> 33:06.879
I'm not telling you.
You'll just come and get me.

33:06.880 --> 33:09.439
I'll see you tomorrow, all being
well.

33:09.440 --> 33:11.239
But if you try to stop me, I won't.

33:11.240 --> 33:14.839
Hannah, please don't rush out like
this. Hannah! Hannah, please don't go!

33:14.840 --> 33:16.639
- Hannah!
- Hannah!

33:16.640 --> 33:18.319
Hannah!

33:18.320 --> 33:20.684
Hannah! Hannah, come back!

33:22.200 --> 33:24.400
Hannah!

33:43.120 --> 33:45.120
Hello?

34:10.480 --> 34:12.199
Hello?

34:13.679 --> 34:14.719
Hello?

34:16.719 --> 34:18.280
Hel...?

34:27.920 --> 34:31.920
I'm so sorry, turning up like this.

34:34.679 --> 34:37.438
I had a quarrel with my parents
and so...

34:37.440 --> 34:39.259
I just came here.

34:41.520 --> 34:43.879
I haven't come to stay or anything.

34:43.880 --> 34:46.839
I was on my way somewhere else,
and I just thought...

34:46.840 --> 34:49.000
Yes!

34:57.280 --> 35:00.099
Your mother is away for a week?

35:19.800 --> 35:21.519
There you are.

35:21.520 --> 35:25.520
I just need a moment alone
with Mr Petrukhin.

35:27.240 --> 35:29.079
You have something for Mr Field,
don't you?

35:29.080 --> 35:34.600
Yes, I have a camera
and... three rolls of film.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.639
You did take a lot of photos,
Mr Petrukhin.

35:39.640 --> 35:40.959
You can keep the camera.

35:40.960 --> 35:43.159
But I won't be needing it again.

35:43.160 --> 35:44.759
Keep the camera.

35:44.760 --> 35:47.559
Now you are to join Mr Field
at the air base.

35:47.560 --> 35:50.160
What, now? Absolutely.

35:56.080 --> 35:59.990
Mr Petrukhin and Mr Johnson
to see Mr Field.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.240
Thank you.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.199
So, gentlemen, we wanted to
honour our side of the bargain.

36:20.200 --> 36:22.919
You're going to bring this place to
life,

36:22.920 --> 36:26.959
everybody bleeping, everybody
in contact with each other.

36:26.960 --> 36:30.079
You have your first order
for the staff locator, Mr Petrukhin.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.999
Today, it's official!

36:32.000 --> 36:33.399
That's good news!

36:33.400 --> 36:34.959
You don't look very happy about it.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.799
He's pleased, aren't you, Mr
Samuel?

36:36.800 --> 36:38.639
He is worried about his daughter
today.

36:38.640 --> 36:41.359
No, I'm just taking it all in.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.999
Something odd about this place.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.439
An air base with no planes, for a
start.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.199
They're arriving soon enough.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.719
We'll leave you it.

36:49.720 --> 36:54.357
I'll show you around, shall I?
The full guided tour.

36:55.240 --> 36:57.120
Gentlemen...

36:58.200 --> 37:02.279
since I've done what you've
asked, I thought I'd return this.

37:02.280 --> 37:05.839
It's such a special camera,
I thought you'd want it back.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.559
No, no, keep the camera.

37:07.560 --> 37:10.239
I thought so.
We're not finished, are we?

37:10.240 --> 37:11.599
There's a catch to all this.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.119
Well, there's always a catch...
to everything.

37:14.120 --> 37:17.839
You're going to keep coming back
for more, setting me new tasks.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.239
Well, that depends.

37:19.240 --> 37:22.319
We still have to look
at your pictures, of course.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.411
Don't worry so much, Mr Petrukhin.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.600
We'll be in touch.

37:30.080 --> 37:33.353
And good luck with your
daughter!

37:36.880 --> 37:38.479
Who are they?!

37:38.480 --> 37:40.519
The bleeper men!

37:40.520 --> 37:42.719
You're the people
who are going to try and track us,

37:42.720 --> 37:44.799
even when we're sleeping, aren't
you?!

37:44.800 --> 37:48.359
Even when we're down the fucking
pub?! You think we want that?!

37:48.360 --> 37:50.559
You think anybody wants that?!

37:50.560 --> 37:52.719
Nobody will ever wear
that thing of yours, ever!

37:52.720 --> 37:54.959
Not for one single day!

37:54.960 --> 37:56.559
What's that all about?

37:56.560 --> 37:59.199
Don't worry about him. People think
your invention's

37:59.200 --> 38:02.879
going to cause them trouble!

38:02.880 --> 38:05.680
Hallelujah!

38:06.720 --> 38:09.679
So my disgrace will probably last
for months - years, even -

38:09.680 --> 38:11.359
but what the hell.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.119
It could be the end of the world
quite soon,

38:13.120 --> 38:15.359
so why worry about
what's going to happen tomorrow?

38:15.360 --> 38:18.519
We could all be blown up!
Duck and cover!

38:18.520 --> 38:20.759
You know what
they taught you to do at school?

38:22.320 --> 38:23.919
Yes!

38:23.920 --> 38:26.479
If the bomb goes off,
hide under the desks.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.999
So we'll all be under the kitchen
table, ducking and covering,

38:29.000 --> 38:32.728
and there'll be
this big mushroom cloud...

38:37.960 --> 38:40.079
Here we are!

38:40.080 --> 38:43.000
- It's party time!
- Woohoo!

38:44.320 --> 38:47.199
- Working on those arms?
- Yes, mate.

38:47.200 --> 38:51.291
Cheers for the help,
by the way, Joel. Cheers.

38:51.480 --> 38:55.479
Right then, let's get
this party started!

38:55.480 --> 38:57.879
- Told you I'd bring it.
- There you go.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.399
Hello, I'm Hannah.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.919
I'm a sort of surprise guest.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.799
Yes, the bleeper girl.

39:03.800 --> 39:06.559
Yeah, we know all about you -
the boss's daughter.

39:06.560 --> 39:09.319
- Well, yes, I am.
- We won't hold it against you.

39:09.320 --> 39:10.999
Not tonight.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.679
Don't ask where we got it.

39:12.680 --> 39:14.199
Or the records.

39:14.200 --> 39:17.599
We're going to wake up
the whole street.

39:17.600 --> 39:22.159
See now, Esther here -
Esther here is a great dancer,

39:22.160 --> 39:24.199
even though
she can't hear the music.

39:24.200 --> 39:27.039
She learnt from watching me!

39:27.040 --> 39:29.586
Well, both of us, more like.

39:30.440 --> 39:35.519
She's saying that neither of us
had anything to do with it!

39:35.520 --> 39:37.399
Maybe I ought to be getting along...

39:37.400 --> 39:39.037
Er, nobody leaves!

40:00.440 --> 40:02.039
Are there more people coming?

40:02.040 --> 40:04.559
No, you'll have to make do with us.

40:04.560 --> 40:07.833
I'm not sure we need any more,
do we?

40:11.840 --> 40:14.113
She's a great kisser too!

40:17.880 --> 40:21.919
What's she saying?
She's saying that we could all be dead

40:21.920 --> 40:24.159
by the end of the week.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.800
So, would you like to dance?

40:45.800 --> 40:48.519
There you are.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.559
She's not back? No, she's not.

40:50.560 --> 40:52.279
How do we find her, Samuel?!

40:52.280 --> 40:55.799
I phoned that girl, Katie, she
sometimes stays with - she's not there.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.359
She's somewhere we don't know.

40:57.360 --> 41:00.088
I've no idea where she's gone.

41:14.360 --> 41:16.400
Come in.

41:20.200 --> 41:23.019
I just thought I'd say goodbye.

41:24.360 --> 41:26.360
I'm about to go, so...

41:27.240 --> 41:28.320
Right.

41:29.720 --> 41:31.959
Goodnight.

41:31.960 --> 41:36.506
- I hope I didn't wake you.
- No, I was very awake.

41:37.600 --> 41:40.419
It's so warm tonight, isn't it?

41:41.720 --> 41:46.239
- And I was just thinking, too...
- About the end of the world?

41:46.240 --> 41:48.079
Maybe.

41:48.080 --> 41:52.717
There are better ways
of getting to sleep, I'm sure.

41:53.160 --> 41:56.439
See you again?

41:56.440 --> 41:58.120
Yes.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.999
Here she is!

43:03.000 --> 43:05.239
Hello, darling.

43:05.240 --> 43:06.719
We're so pleased to see you!

43:06.720 --> 43:08.839
Where have you been?!

43:08.840 --> 43:11.079
With a friend.

43:11.080 --> 43:12.679
No, Samuel.

43:12.680 --> 43:14.408
She's back with us.

43:45.720 --> 43:48.919
Are you really taking
that young girl to the ball?

43:48.920 --> 43:51.759
I am.

43:51.760 --> 43:54.319
It's quite extraordinary
that it's still going on.

43:54.320 --> 43:56.999
The Queen Charlotte Ball...

43:57.000 --> 43:59.182
That ghastly giant cake!

44:00.040 --> 44:03.079
What must foreigners think
of all those young English girls

44:03.080 --> 44:06.359
worshipping a gigantic cake?

44:06.360 --> 44:08.519
Yes, I remember the cake.

44:08.520 --> 44:13.319
When you finally got a piece,
it tastes just like cardboard.

44:13.320 --> 44:18.048
But it will be good to be
amongst young people again.

44:18.480 --> 44:20.240
Here she comes.

44:29.520 --> 44:31.999
Don't look so worried, both of you.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.879
I'll be on my best behaviour.

44:33.880 --> 44:36.608
Nothing will go wrong tonight.

44:41.600 --> 44:45.119
It's so good of you to come to pick her up
from our out-of-the-way neighbourhood.

44:45.120 --> 44:47.559
Please, it's no trouble.

44:47.560 --> 44:50.015
I'm quite excited, in fact.

45:00.600 --> 45:03.200
Stop the car.

45:09.040 --> 45:12.479
I just have something to confess to
you, Hannah, before we go any further.

45:12.480 --> 45:15.439
If you don't want to come, Mrs Shaw...
No!

45:15.440 --> 45:17.959
I just want to own up to something.

45:17.960 --> 45:22.999
I'm coming with you tonight not
purely out of the goodness of my heart,

45:23.000 --> 45:26.159
but because I've persuaded myself
that there's the possibility

45:26.160 --> 45:28.303
that some of Anthony's friends
will be there.

45:28.304 --> 45:29.934
Certain men return
year after year

45:29.935 --> 45:32.679
because they like all the young
women that are on display.

45:32.680 --> 45:35.399
- I bet they do!
- And there's one boy in particular...

45:35.400 --> 45:37.599
Well, he's not a boy any more,
of course.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.399
Paul Ledbury.

45:39.400 --> 45:42.399
I've been trying to get to see him
for months.

45:42.400 --> 45:46.400
I just wanted to confess that to
you, Hannah.

45:48.440 --> 45:50.200
Yes, well...

45:51.480 --> 45:54.279
I'm on a mission too.

45:54.280 --> 45:57.519
To find out who betrayed me
to my parents.

45:57.520 --> 46:02.339
That's the main reason I'm going,
to find that person.

46:26.120 --> 46:29.119
My God. Look at them, Hannah.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.799
They're like ghosts!

46:30.800 --> 46:33.759
Maybe they haven't moved from those
chairs since I was here as a girl.

46:33.760 --> 46:36.079
You don't have to go
and sit amongst them, do you?

46:36.080 --> 46:37.679
Well, that's what's expected.

46:37.680 --> 46:40.159
That's not what's going to happen!

46:40.160 --> 46:42.479
I feel sorry for these girls.

46:42.480 --> 46:47.159
The only thing they're being
encouraged to look forward to is marriage.

46:47.160 --> 46:50.679
Let's take a closer look
at some of these young men.

46:52.400 --> 46:53.919
Maybe she knows something.

46:53.920 --> 46:57.193
You think she could be the informer?

47:02.120 --> 47:04.399
- Hello, Ruth.
- Hello, Hannah.

47:04.400 --> 47:06.239
How are you?

47:06.240 --> 47:07.786
I've been better.

47:08.720 --> 47:12.319
Now has anybody here been writing
anonymous letters to Hannah's parents?

47:12.320 --> 47:13.959
Why should we do that?

47:13.960 --> 47:15.639
Why indeed?

47:15.640 --> 47:19.279
I just want you to know that we're
onto you, whoever you are.

47:19.280 --> 47:23.119
And, when we've found you, I'll be
writing a letter to your parents

47:23.120 --> 47:25.799
and then I'll definitely be paying
them a visit as well.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.999
And the one thing
you should know about me

47:28.000 --> 47:31.910
is that I always do
what I say I'm going to.

47:37.040 --> 47:40.879
That was brilliant!
You were fantastic!

47:40.880 --> 47:43.359
It's like being back at school
on the last day of term!

47:43.360 --> 47:45.479
All one's inhibitions seem to go.

47:45.480 --> 47:49.160
Hello there, Paul. So good to see
you.

47:52.800 --> 47:55.160
There's Paul Ledbury.

47:58.800 --> 48:00.759
Paul!

48:00.760 --> 48:05.639
Evening.
I'm sure we'll see each other later.

48:05.640 --> 48:08.280
Paul! Paul Ledbury!

48:13.040 --> 48:15.799
Paul!

48:15.800 --> 48:18.799
Paul?

48:18.800 --> 48:20.279
Paul!

48:20.280 --> 48:24.644
The cake is coming!
The cake is coming, everyone!

48:39.160 --> 48:41.879
Paul. Paul!

48:41.880 --> 48:44.039
Mrs Shaw, what on earth
are you doing here?

48:44.040 --> 48:46.599
I'm delighted to see you, Mrs Shaw,
but we're missing the cake.

48:46.600 --> 48:48.919
So we are. But you looked as though
you were just leaving.

48:48.920 --> 48:50.639
On the contrary, I've just arrived.

48:50.640 --> 48:55.822
You've seen the cake many times
before, haven't you, Paul?

49:21.360 --> 49:24.039
Can I just ask you one question,
Paul?

49:24.040 --> 49:25.239
Please?

49:25.240 --> 49:28.759
Have you spoken to Anthony at all
since he's disappeared?

49:28.760 --> 49:32.079
No, of course not. I would've told
you at once if I had.

49:32.080 --> 49:34.535
Has he ever written to you?

49:37.200 --> 49:41.599
I want to help, Mrs Shaw, of course
I do. But I can't make things up...

49:41.600 --> 49:43.799
Well, nobody wants you to make
things up!

49:43.800 --> 49:45.599
Now, has he ever written to you?

49:45.600 --> 49:47.919
No, I've told you that!

49:47.920 --> 49:50.839
- I think you're lying to me, Paul.
- I'm not.

49:50.840 --> 49:52.399
Why should I lie to you, Mrs Shaw?

49:52.400 --> 49:54.599
I know you may have some code of
honour,

49:54.600 --> 49:57.119
some oath between you
about keeping secrets,

49:57.120 --> 49:59.239
but you are dealing with me now.

49:59.240 --> 50:01.399
You tell me the truth!

50:01.400 --> 50:04.799
Did you ever have an address for him
since he disappeared?

50:04.800 --> 50:07.052
Not for years.
I've not had one for years and years...

50:07.053 --> 50:08.319
But you have an address!

50:08.320 --> 50:10.799
I believe you do!
Do you have it on you?

50:10.800 --> 50:13.079
- Of course I don't!
- I think you might have.

50:13.080 --> 50:16.679
- Is it in your wallet?
- Mrs Shaw, what are you doing?!

50:16.680 --> 50:19.135
Mrs Shaw, this has to stop!

50:19.920 --> 50:22.359
If I have something,
I will send it to you.

50:22.360 --> 50:24.919
You have something.
So you have something, Paul?

50:24.920 --> 50:29.648
If I have something,
I will send it to you, Mrs Shaw.

51:09.480 --> 51:12.119
She's a Jew, isn't she?

51:12.120 --> 51:13.799
Yes.

51:13.800 --> 51:19.619
And they always think they can
do things differently, don't they?

51:35.880 --> 51:40.279
- You didn't curtsey to the cake.
- Yes, I did notice that myself.

51:40.280 --> 51:43.799
Why does an attractive girl like you
not want to curtsey to the cake?

51:43.800 --> 51:45.559
Will you please let go of me?

51:45.560 --> 51:47.959
Are you trying to tell us something?

51:47.960 --> 51:51.319
Perhaps you're a bit too experienced
to do that? In which case...

51:51.320 --> 51:55.519
Will you kindly...
let... go... of me?

51:55.520 --> 51:58.199
I think you should tell me a little
more about yourself, don't you?

51:58.200 --> 52:00.928
Will you bloody let go of me?!

52:08.000 --> 52:11.159
Now I really have made
a spectacle of myself.

52:11.160 --> 52:13.799
If only I'd curtsied
to the wretched cake,

52:13.800 --> 52:16.559
but for some reason I couldn't.

52:16.560 --> 52:20.759
Don't be silly, Hannah.
He got what he was asking for.

52:20.760 --> 52:24.479
Look, lots of girls want to do what
you did. They'll be applauding you.

52:24.480 --> 52:27.279
The letters will be pouring in
to my parents now.

52:27.280 --> 52:29.439
No letters will be written
to your parents.

52:29.440 --> 52:31.759
We frightened them too much
for that to happen.

52:31.760 --> 52:34.839
And if there is a problem,
I will deal with it,

52:34.840 --> 52:38.199
your chaperone will deal with it.

52:38.200 --> 52:40.599
I feel I can handle anything
tonight.

52:40.600 --> 52:43.691
I have my very first lead, Hannah.

52:46.400 --> 52:49.639
So we're here at last,
and the contract's ready for signing.

52:49.640 --> 52:52.199
We're going to do
it in their office tomorrow.

52:52.200 --> 52:55.719
That's quicker than I thought it
would be.

52:55.720 --> 52:59.559
There's a telephone call for you,
Mr Samuel.

52:59.560 --> 53:02.319
- Yes?
- Mr Petrukhin?

53:02.320 --> 53:04.439
Arthur Wallington here.

53:04.440 --> 53:06.919
I'm nearby. Can I drop in and see
you?

53:06.920 --> 53:08.600
Say half an hour?

53:11.360 --> 53:15.360
Hello. Hello. Hello.

53:17.040 --> 53:21.677
The home of the staff locator,
I see it at last!

53:23.480 --> 53:25.879
Now, Mr Petrukhin,
it's nearly the end of the day,

53:25.880 --> 53:28.971
why don't you send everybody home?

53:29.320 --> 53:31.502
Is that too much to ask?

53:35.320 --> 53:37.719
Only one glass. Are you not having
any?

53:37.720 --> 53:40.719
I'm not, no.
I'm only staying for a moment.

53:40.720 --> 53:44.920
And I have some very ripe French
cheese...

53:45.960 --> 53:51.688
to accompany the wine. I've heard
about your fondness for it.

53:52.160 --> 53:55.239
What can I do for you, Lord
Wallington?

53:55.240 --> 53:57.319
I think you know.

53:57.320 --> 54:00.048
Not very hard to guess, is it?

54:02.800 --> 54:06.255
You took an awful lot of
photographs...

54:06.280 --> 54:09.399
at the fishing competition,
didn't you?

54:09.400 --> 54:11.039
I like taking photographs.

54:11.040 --> 54:13.439
Yes.

54:13.440 --> 54:14.919
Of course you do.

54:14.920 --> 54:20.679
But somebody asked you to take
these particular ones, didn't they?

54:20.680 --> 54:23.408
You're not drinking your wine.

54:25.040 --> 54:26.799
It's a little early.

54:26.800 --> 54:30.279
So are you going to tell me who told
you to take the photographs?

54:30.280 --> 54:33.079
Nobody told me to take them,
definitely not.

54:33.080 --> 54:34.239
We both know they did.

54:34.240 --> 54:37.999
Anyway, it's not particularly
difficult to work it out.

54:38.000 --> 54:41.719
I like to think I'm a reasonably
well-informed person, Mr Petrukhin.

54:41.720 --> 54:44.839
I have some interesting
acquaintances who know certain things

54:44.840 --> 54:47.119
that the general public do not.

54:47.120 --> 54:52.359
And some of these people have
suspicions - very strong suspicions -

54:52.360 --> 54:57.159
about the penetration that has
occurred in our secret service.

54:57.160 --> 54:59.119
What if I was to tell you

54:59.120 --> 55:01.839
that you've got everything
the wrong way round, Samuel?

55:01.840 --> 55:04.359
Simply and utterly
the wrong way round.

55:04.360 --> 55:08.799
And that the pictures you took
along the river bank with this

55:08.800 --> 55:14.437
actually show something completely
different to what you think.

55:16.680 --> 55:21.839
What if I was to tell you
that the people you're seeing in MI5

55:21.840 --> 55:23.159
are not what they seem?

55:23.160 --> 55:26.433
In what way? If I have seen anybody.

55:27.600 --> 55:30.600
They're working for the Russians.

55:32.200 --> 55:37.439
- Your Mr Field is a Soviet agent.
- What?

55:37.440 --> 55:39.719
I only know him through his order
for the staff locator.

55:39.720 --> 55:42.902
He's an agent for the Soviet Union.

55:45.720 --> 55:48.879
What evidence do you have of this
that you can show me?

55:48.880 --> 55:50.919
I don't.

55:50.920 --> 55:52.999
Nothing at all that's conclusive.

55:53.000 --> 55:54.999
But I'm working on it.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.678
I know that you
won't believe me.

55:56.679 --> 55:59.439
- No, I don't believe you. Not at all.
- Of course not.

55:59.440 --> 56:03.479
Why should you?
I wouldn't believe it either.

56:03.480 --> 56:06.679
So you'll need to find
your own evidence, won't you?

56:06.680 --> 56:10.771
Seek it out,
find out who's telling the truth.

56:11.560 --> 56:16.833
Because I know you're not working
for the Russians, Samuel.

56:16.840 --> 56:19.477
But a gentle word of warning.

56:19.800 --> 56:23.919
Don't, whatever you do,
let them see what you're doing.

56:23.920 --> 56:27.557
Because they'll deal with you
if they do.

56:29.200 --> 56:30.959
Deal with me?

56:30.960 --> 56:32.480
Yes.

56:33.520 --> 56:37.702
I will do everything I can
to help you, Samuel.

56:50.880 --> 56:53.960
Thank you, Betty.

57:12.240 --> 57:13.759
Goodness me. Wonderful.

57:13.760 --> 57:17.319
We have both tea and champagne,
Mr Petrukhin.

57:17.320 --> 57:20.919
To celebrate the signing of the
contract. And what is even more special?

57:20.920 --> 57:23.839
Miss Godwin here
has provided biscuits today.

57:23.840 --> 57:26.719
We never, ever get biscuits
normally.

57:26.720 --> 57:29.599
The day we sign the contract.

57:29.600 --> 57:31.119
Don't look so serious, Mr Samuel!

57:31.120 --> 57:35.159
This is a big moment - a joyous
moment after all this time!

57:35.160 --> 57:37.919
Indeed. But then we all
show joy differently, don't we?

57:37.920 --> 57:40.279
Never thought this moment
would come, did you?

57:40.280 --> 57:42.919
Someone should
take a picture of the signing!

57:42.920 --> 57:45.719
The first contract
for the staff locator.

57:45.720 --> 57:47.679
Yes, it could even
be of historic interest.

57:47.680 --> 57:52.079
Yes. Yes, I have, in fact,
got the camera in my briefcase.

57:52.080 --> 57:56.353
Because I keep trying to return it,
as you know.

58:04.240 --> 58:07.150
Not snarling at me today, I see.

58:09.640 --> 58:13.731
I'd better go and sign the
contract, hadn't I?

58:13.960 --> 58:15.688
Of course I should.

58:46.120 --> 58:48.575
Why do you understand that?
