00:05.960 --> 00:08.087
Oh, God! Oh, God!
I'm in the butt!

00:08.240 --> 00:09.321
But I don't see the book.
Where is it?

00:09.480 --> 00:11.767
It's locked up in the Delta,
safe and sound.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.446
I cannot believe you guys
jacked this from Ashy Slashy.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.681
Are you insane?

00:15.840 --> 00:18.286
"Misartra."

00:18.440 --> 00:19.521
- (screams)
- What the fuck was that?!

00:19.680 --> 00:21.762
- Ah!
<i>'</i> st°n it!

00:21.920 --> 00:24.685
What is your genius plan
for getting the book back?

00:24.840 --> 00:26.444
And throw one of
our epic parties tonight.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.125
The kids who stole your car
will show up.

00:28.280 --> 00:29.520
Ruby: We might not be able
to find the book,

00:29.680 --> 00:31.921
but we can go after the ones
who are searching for it.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.969
- (distorted) Mama.
- Then let's go kill your kids.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.726
Ash: What the rice and beans
is he doing here?

00:36.880 --> 00:39.008
- (growling)
- Ah! Help!

00:39.160 --> 00:41.447
Believe it or not Dad,
this is my day job.

00:41.640 --> 00:43.927
(screams)
Ashy Slashy's going to kill us all!

00:44.080 --> 00:46.208
Hey, relax!
Everything's fine!

00:46.360 --> 00:48.567
Brock: My son is a hero.
You hear me? He's a hero!

00:48.720 --> 00:51.564
- You really mean that, Dad?
- I was wrong.

00:52.440 --> 00:53.441
(horn honks)

01:01.320 --> 01:03.322
Ah, Dad.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.884
You can't be dead now.

01:06.640 --> 01:07.971
Not after everything
we've been through,

01:08.120 --> 01:10.168
with all the bitterness
and the hatred and...

01:10.320 --> 01:12.527
and now we finally made peace
with each other.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.608
I'm so sorry, Jefe.

01:17.480 --> 01:21.166
You're right, it's not fair.

01:21.320 --> 01:23.687
Fate is a cruel mistress, Pablo.

01:24.280 --> 01:27.250
Everyone I've ever loved
has been taken from me.

01:27.440 --> 01:30.683
Next time it's going to be you
or Kelly or Eli or...

01:31.600 --> 01:34.843
Well, no, that's pretty much it,
but one of you three.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.685
- No doubt about it.
- Don't worry.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.683
I'm done letting fate choose for me.

01:39.840 --> 01:43.003
From now on, I'm grabbing
the bull by the horns, Jefe.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.043
Won't make a pube hair
of difference, Pablo.

01:45.200 --> 01:49.125
My advice, think of your life
as a good time, not a long time.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.685
- No, thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.043
Well, Pop,

01:56.200 --> 01:58.601
I guess it's time
to ride the pale horse

01:58.800 --> 02:01.690
up to the discount
hardware store in the sky.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.647
Pablo, you don't see another eyeball
around here, do you?

02:23.800 --> 02:25.564
No.

02:25.720 --> 02:28.564

Oh, sure.
We can reminisce later.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.165
Right. Hey, let's get going.
What do you say?

04:18.360 --> 04:19.725
Yeah, okay.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.369
Chet, I got a great idea.

04:33.520 --> 04:36.444
If I drive, you can keep pounding
brewskies the whole time.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.648
- I can stay hydrated!
- Exactly.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.080
- Great idea.
- Yes! Okay!

04:40.240 --> 04:41.446
- Okay, go that way.
- Okay.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.364

Crushed it!

05:30.240 --> 05:31.651
Huh?

05:33.080 --> 05:36.050
Dude, there's a chainsaw
in my backseat.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.763
Yeah, that's mine.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.570
What's it for?

05:40.720 --> 05:43.451
Um... ice sculpture?

05:43.600 --> 05:45.364
Oh.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.965
And the shotgun?

05:48.120 --> 05:49.770
Uh, that's mine, too.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.445
What's that for?

05:51.600 --> 05:53.602
In case they don't pay
for the ice sculpture.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.250
- Oh.
- Huh?

05:55.400 --> 05:56.401
Yeah.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.121
Wait. Oh, dude. No.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.090
You passed it, man.
Mammary's is the other way!

06:04.240 --> 06:05.765
Uh, no, no, no.
Chet, uh, hey.

06:05.920 --> 06:09.003
I just remembered that, uh,
they had to close Mammary Lane down.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.766
- Huh?
- Yeah, asbestos in the poles.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.446
Chicks were getting, uh,
rashes on their hoochie-ma-kooters.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.689
But, hey, don't sweat it.
I got another place.

06:17.840 --> 06:21.003
Hey, Chet, uh, keep your eye out
for the Delta, can you?

06:21.160 --> 06:22.491
- Yeah.
- On our way there?

06:22.640 --> 06:24.722
Yeah.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.445
Where are the guns at?

06:44.680 --> 06:46.489
Impressive.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.211
Kelly: We weren't intending
to stockpile an arsenal,

06:49.360 --> 06:51.966
but you know what they say,
"When in Jacksonville"...

06:52.120 --> 06:53.360
We got to move.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.649
In the time we've wasted,
my spawn could have found the book.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.802
And if they've already raised Baal...

06:58.960 --> 07:01.531
- (sighs)
- What?

07:01.680 --> 07:04.684
Every time
you talk about this "Baal,"

07:04.840 --> 07:07.844
you trail off,
which is really annoying by the way,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.651
but it makes me think

07:10.800 --> 07:13.167
that you're hiding something.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.166
I'm not hiding anything.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.003
It's just...

07:22.160 --> 07:23.685
Baal has a power over me.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.689
And not just me, everyone.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.008
Yeah, he's a demon.
That makes sense.

07:28.160 --> 07:29.685
He's not a typical demon.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.406
Baal doesn't use brute force,
he breeds paranoia.

07:32.560 --> 07:36.360
He-he gets into people's psyches,
turning them against each other,

07:36.520 --> 07:38.409
until they annihilate themselves.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.728
(clicks tongue)
Well, you sure can pick 'em.

07:40.880 --> 07:43.884
I didn't pick him,
that's the point.

07:44.040 --> 07:47.408
He is seductive
and he's manipulative.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.927
You just can't resist him.

07:50.080 --> 07:53.721
And I'm afraid that if we do not get to
my spawn before they raise Baal,

07:53.880 --> 07:55.928
I will not have the strength
to fight him.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.884
No.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.445
You just think that way

07:59.600 --> 08:02.126
'cause you've been fighting alone
for thousands of years.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.726
But now you got me, okay?

08:04.920 --> 08:08.049
I promise I will help you
kill your spawn.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.806
Just tell me what we need to do.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.365
- Oh, my God, no!

08:14.520 --> 08:16.363

08:19.760 --> 08:22.684

- No way.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.889

08:28.880 --> 08:30.484
Shit!

Please make it stop!

08:33.240 --> 08:35.082
- Please make it stop!
- You okay?

08:35.280 --> 08:38.489
Forget her, Pablo!
This is about you and me!

08:38.640 --> 08:40.164
(whispers)
What the hell is that thing?

08:40.320 --> 08:44.609
It's just a stupid book
that talks and does evil things.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.569
- (yells)
- Pablo!

08:46.720 --> 08:47.960
- (screams)
- Oh, shit!

08:48.120 --> 08:49.963
Book:
Tell her the truth!

08:50.120 --> 08:52.964
Tell her our destinies
are intertwined.

08:53.120 --> 08:57.444
That we're bound by
the most powerful force imaginable.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.802
Embrace the truth, Pablo!

08:59.960 --> 09:01.325
Look at yourself!

Jefe...

10:03.560 --> 10:05.688
Okay, I'm going to pull it out!
Let's go for it.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.320
Okay-

10:08.480 --> 10:10.244
You ready? Hang on now.

10:12.040 --> 10:15.203
- (groans, screams)
- Okay, okay!

10:15.360 --> 10:16.521
- Can't help... not that way.
- That's not going to work.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.284
- Okay, hold on.
- (Pablo groaning)

10:23.520 --> 10:25.170

10:37.560 --> 10:41.201
- (panting, screams)
- Don't worry.

10:41.360 --> 10:44.284
It's okay.
We got it worked out.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.727
All right?
We're going to take care of this.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.281
What you need is some sleep.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.444
You need to rest right over here
in the trunk.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.931
It's really nice in there.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.605
- So, Pablo...
- Why in the trunk, Jefe?

10:55.800 --> 10:57.245
- Because we have to.
- No.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.402
I want you to trust me on this.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.006
There we go.
Just get in the trunk.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.811
Ah! No, no!

11:06.960 --> 11:09.247
- Jefe! No! Please!
- You want to be free of that book?

11:09.400 --> 11:11.607
Then you get in the goddamn trunk!

11:11.760 --> 11:14.525
(gasping)
Okay.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.924
I'm sorry, Jefe. Please!

11:21.080 --> 11:23.447
- See you on the other side, amigo.
- No!

11:23.600 --> 11:25.443
Lacey: Pablo? Hey!
Pablo, get up!

11:25.600 --> 11:26.886
What are you doing?
Get up!

11:27.080 --> 11:30.482
Somebody's following us.
Someone is following us.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.245
- Chet, there it is! The Delta.
- Huh?

11:34.760 --> 11:37.286
(engine revving)

11:37.440 --> 11:40.205
- Chet, sit back.
- What's that for?

11:41.640 --> 11:44.450
Oh!
Sweet monkey Jesus, Ash!

11:44.640 --> 11:47.405
- What's your problem?!
- Take the wheel.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.921
- How do you think I feel?
- Take the wheel!

11:50.080 --> 11:52.003
I'm going to take the wheel!

11:53.520 --> 11:55.966
- Chet, take the gun!
- Okay, yeah.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.088
<i>L</i> 90f you!

11:58.240 --> 12:01.050
(yells) No!

12:01.240 --> 12:02.480
Give me the gun!

12:08.320 --> 12:09.731
Lacey:
He's going to shoot again!

12:16.960 --> 12:19.167
- Whoa.
- (both grunt)

12:21.200 --> 12:22.440
Shit!

12:22.600 --> 12:24.284
- (brakes screech)
- Whoa.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.411
- What are you doing?!
- What are you doing?!

12:31.760 --> 12:34.161
All right, Chet,
I got to come clean.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.130
We're-we're not going
to a titty bar.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.208
But...

12:40.400 --> 12:42.129
then...

12:47.760 --> 12:48.761
Where?

12:48.920 --> 12:50.331
- You want to know?
- Yes.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.642
Okay, I'll give you
the abridged version.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.689
- Good.
- There's an evil book.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.207
It possessed my car,
then it killed my dad.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.930
There's little demons
who want the book.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.162
I can't let them get that book,
'cause if they do,

13:01.320 --> 13:03.527
they'll use the book
to summon a bigger demon.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.286
That's the whole story.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.529
Okay, man. Come on.

13:09.720 --> 13:11.722
Let's kill us some demons!
Yeah!

13:11.880 --> 13:13.609
No. Sorry, Chet.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.046
This is the end of the road for you.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.929
What? No, man.

13:17.080 --> 13:19.731
Come on, we're in it together
till the wheels fall off, remember?

13:19.880 --> 13:21.882
There's some things
a man has to do alone.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.168
(sighs)
Like what?

13:24.360 --> 13:25.964
Like drinking in the morning.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.043
Like putting antifungal
ointment on your...

13:28.240 --> 13:30.720
- Balls.
- Yeah. You understand me, Chet.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.882
That's why you know
I got to do this alone.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.890
I just got to get to the old Smash 'Em Up,
take care of business,

13:36.080 --> 13:37.445
and I'll catch you on the flip-flop.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.921
Wait a minute.
The Smash 'Em Up derby.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.286
Oh, I get it now!

13:41.440 --> 13:43.841
Yes, because it was there,
in the Delta,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.401
where I first boned
Lillian Pendergrass.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.483
Oh, see, 'cause I thought
it was because

13:48.680 --> 13:50.125
that's where your dad got the Delta,

13:50.280 --> 13:52.681
and then the Delta came back to
run him over as sort of a "cry for help,"

13:52.840 --> 13:56.162
and then it went back to the place where
your dad originally got it, you know.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.527
I guess it just jived with
the whole cathartic symmetry of that.

13:58.680 --> 14:01.081
Sort of a circle of life
kind of a thing.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.686
Yeah, Chet,
that could work, too.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.285
Either way,
I think the car's going there.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.930
- Can you drop me?
- Shit, yes, brother.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.368

you drunk driving angel.
