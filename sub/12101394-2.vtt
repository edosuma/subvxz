-NARRATOR:
Imagine meeting yourself.

00:08.134 --> 00:09.218
Who do you see?

00:09.301 --> 00:12.304
♪♪

00:25.735 --> 00:28.738
♪♪

00:34.160 --> 00:35.995
-It's wrong.
-What?

00:36.078 --> 00:37.747
-What?

00:37.830 --> 00:39.457
Really. What?

00:39.540 --> 00:41.917
Look, everything. All right?
Everything is wrong.

00:42.001 --> 00:43.711
-Well, I read that
every reunion is different.

00:43.836 --> 00:44.879
-Don't call it that.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.505
-What do you want me
to call it, Tom?

00:46.589 --> 00:48.382
-I don't know,
but it's not a reunion.

00:48.466 --> 00:50.342
-Mm...
-I shouldn't have called.

00:50.426 --> 00:52.178
All right?
I should have never called.

00:52.261 --> 00:53.971
-I wouldn't be here
if you hadn't called.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.973
-That's what I'm saying.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.475
My nose isn't...

00:59.560 --> 01:00.686
I have a...

01:00.770 --> 01:01.937
And your neck!

01:02.021 --> 01:04.356
It's all, like,
fuckin' necky.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.735
-We're identical, Tom.

01:07.818 --> 01:11.113
You think this is easy for me,
to meet you for the first time?

01:11.197 --> 01:13.324
Well, fuckin' A,
it must be easy for you.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.742
If you think you look like me,

01:14.825 --> 01:17.369
it must be like winning
a fuckin' jackpot!

01:18.287 --> 01:20.289
-Oh, you're an asshole.

01:20.998 --> 01:24.210
-You can't call me that.
-I just did, asshole.

01:24.251 --> 01:27.213
-You... You can't do that.
All right?

01:27.296 --> 01:29.423
There's... There's...
There's a user agreement.

01:29.507 --> 01:31.175
It's not supposed to
be like this.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.345
-Well, what'd you expect,
we'd blow each other?

01:34.428 --> 01:39.767
-I saw one of these reunions
on the "Today Show." Okay?

01:39.850 --> 01:44.522
A doctor told me about it,
said I should see it.

01:44.605 --> 01:48.400
So I YouTube'd the damn thing
and... there she was.

01:48.484 --> 01:50.486
[liquid pouring]

01:50.569 --> 01:53.614
National treasure, Hoda Kotb.

01:53.697 --> 01:58.661
She had this old woman on.
Ovarian cancer. Her.

01:58.744 --> 02:01.413
They brought out
the old woman's twin.

02:01.497 --> 02:05.251
God, they were identical.

02:05.334 --> 02:08.045
Carbon copy.

02:08.128 --> 02:11.674
I mean... there were tears,

02:11.757 --> 02:14.301
and they were holding hands.

02:14.385 --> 02:16.762
And no one could believe it,
I mean...

02:16.846 --> 02:19.932
her family was there
and they were just...

02:20.015 --> 02:21.517
And it was all like...

02:25.062 --> 02:27.231
That's why we're even here.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.900
That's why I looked up
the website.

02:29.984 --> 02:32.152
That's why I called
the customer care rep,

02:32.236 --> 02:36.240
paid the 30 grand and agreed
to wait six to eight weeks.

02:36.323 --> 02:39.076
It's just all fuckin' wrong.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.579
-Well, like I said,
every reunion is different.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.205
-I said don't call it that.

02:43.289 --> 02:45.082
-What would you like
for me to call it, Tom?

02:45.165 --> 02:47.459
-I don't know.

02:47.543 --> 02:49.545
A meeting,
a.a.a business meeting.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.338
-Well, most of these
are done at home.

02:51.422 --> 02:53.048
-Well, I would never
let you near my family.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.842
[coughing]

03:11.483 --> 03:13.903
[breathing heavily]

03:15.279 --> 03:16.989
-Look, I'm sorry
Hoda Kotb isn't here.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.449
-It's not about Hoda Kotb.

03:20.075 --> 03:24.246
-This was never gonna be like
the "Today Show," Tom.

03:24.330 --> 03:27.875
And it's because the company
chose that old woman,

03:27.958 --> 03:32.129
because she was sweet and kind,

03:32.212 --> 03:34.632
and she was a good crier,

03:34.715 --> 03:38.844
and she was from Akron, Ohio,
and she wasn't an asshole.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.681
You are an asshole, Tom.

03:42.765 --> 03:45.726
And this is your nose,
and these are your eyes,

03:45.809 --> 03:49.730
and your neck is
pretty fuckin' necky.

03:49.813 --> 03:52.399
I'm sorry to be the one to have
to tell you that, but it's true.

03:52.483 --> 03:55.819
-I didn't pay 30 grand
to be criticized like this.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.196
I'm calling customer care.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.948
-You know what that
could do to me?

03:59.031 --> 04:00.240
-Yes, I do.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.037
Yes, returning customer.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.914
-MAN: [on phone, indistinct]

04:06.997 --> 04:08.999
-Yeah, hi, Bennett,
how are you?

04:09.083 --> 04:11.835
My name is Tom Wykgowski.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.380
Account number?
I don't have it.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.715
Oh, I can just ask...

04:18.717 --> 04:21.971
-MAN: Tom,
are you still there?

04:22.054 --> 04:23.806
Yeah, I'm still here.

04:24.515 --> 04:27.685
-854...

04:27.768 --> 04:32.564

04:34.858 --> 04:36.402
-2...
-9.

04:36.485 --> 04:37.528
-9.

04:39.822 --> 04:42.616
Yes. Okay.
Yes, hi, Bennett.

04:42.700 --> 04:47.496
Yes, he came today. Right.
But I paid 30 grand for this...

04:47.579 --> 04:51.625
[scoffs]
He looks nothing like me.

04:51.709 --> 04:52.751
All right, fine.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.838
You know what?
Looks aside...

04:55.921 --> 04:57.631
He acts nothing like me,
Bennett.

04:57.715 --> 05:00.467
He's... He's petty,
he's sarcastic,

05:00.551 --> 05:02.261
and he's a fuckin' asshole.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.596
No, Bennett,
I'm not an asshole.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.931
-[chuckles]

05:06.015 --> 05:08.267
-You can look up my account
all you want...

05:09.476 --> 05:10.936
Well, what's
an asshole quotient?

05:11.020 --> 05:12.771
And how the hell am I a seven?

05:12.855 --> 05:15.357
Mother... Look,
I want my fuckin' money back!

05:15.441 --> 05:17.735
I want a full refund.
That's right.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.779
I'll drop him off at
the nearest packaging center...

05:20.863 --> 05:23.282
This is supposed to be
more like Hoda Kotb!

05:25.743 --> 05:27.995
-How'd that go, Tom?

05:28.078 --> 05:31.540
-Well.
[coughing]

05:36.086 --> 05:41.008
Look, the guy
from your company said

05:41.091 --> 05:44.428
my asshole quotient is seven.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.431
-You called your
daughter's friend a dipshit

05:47.514 --> 05:49.391
two days ago over text
to your wife.

05:49.475 --> 05:52.978
-Well, Bailey is a dipshit.
-She's four, Tom.

05:53.062 --> 05:55.230
-[sighs] What other quotients
are there?

05:55.314 --> 05:58.442
-Anger is a six.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.652
Sarcasm is an eight.

06:00.736 --> 06:03.238
Fear is a nine.

06:03.322 --> 06:05.115
-Who did you even talk to
about this?

06:05.199 --> 06:06.742
-Your mom.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.328
-You talked to my mom?

06:09.411 --> 06:11.497
-And I had a lovely time.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.082
-What did she say?

06:13.165 --> 06:14.792
-Well, she told me
all about you.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.127
-What did she say?
-That's confidential.

06:17.211 --> 06:18.504
-Please.

06:20.506 --> 06:23.801
-She said you picked your nose
a lot as a kid.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.471
She said you hated
her tuna casserole.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.099
She said she once
walked in on you masturbating

06:30.182 --> 06:32.184
to an episode of
the "Powerpuff Girls."

06:32.267 --> 06:34.603
-That never happened.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.647
-She said she's angry with you.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.233
She doesn't know why
you haven't called her

06:39.316 --> 06:40.776
in five months.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.821
-Does she hate me?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.906
-Why would she hate you?
-I don't know.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.117
-Why would your mother hate you?
-'Cause I'm leaving.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.624
-But you're not leaving.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.044
-I am, though.

06:59.128 --> 07:00.462
-Tom, you're not leaving.

07:02.506 --> 07:03.590
-I'm leaving.

07:06.552 --> 07:07.970
Four to five months.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.515
That's how long they said
I had left, right?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.559
That's what they gave me.
-I know that.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.894
But your not leaving.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.521
It's not your choice.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.898
It has nothing to do with you.

07:19.982 --> 07:23.026
Now, of course,
she doesn't hate you.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.778
She loves you.

07:24.862 --> 07:27.739
That's why she's angry
with you, she just...

07:27.823 --> 07:29.158
wishes you would call.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.996
Look, I know you.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.832
-You don't.
-I do.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.168
Parts of you, at least.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.586
And I know that
you're not gonna let

07:40.669 --> 07:43.463
30 grand go to waste.

07:43.547 --> 07:47.217
We don't have a lot of
time left together, Tom.

07:47.301 --> 07:50.429
We only have about...
15 minutes.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.975
And we have
a lot more to cover.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.769
So...

07:57.853 --> 08:00.147
I think we should
get started, right?

08:00.230 --> 08:01.440
-Fine.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.775
-Okay.

08:03.859 --> 08:07.988
-The accounts
can all be accessed

08:08.071 --> 08:10.115
through my computer.
-I know.

08:10.199 --> 08:12.910
-So you need to make sure that
you're diversifying the fund.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.787
-Class C-53 bonds at
a net rate divestment of

08:15.871 --> 08:18.207
34.56 percent market cap.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.500
I spent the morning
looking over your books.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.419
-You can't just...

08:22.502 --> 08:25.547
That's 15 years of work.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.382
It took me 15 years
to build that.

08:27.466 --> 08:32.262
-And it adds up to
a simple algorithm.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.306
Just a simple code.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.725
It's amazing what we
spend our time doing. Right?

08:36.808 --> 08:38.268
[chuckles]

08:38.352 --> 08:41.271
Tom, I've poured through
millions of your emails,

08:41.355 --> 08:45.108
text messages, photos,
home videos, blog posts,

08:45.192 --> 08:48.946
Twitter feeds,
pig vid stories,

08:49.029 --> 08:52.282
but I need things that
can't be measured.

08:52.366 --> 08:55.786
Or read.
Or viewed or seen.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.330
I need things that
make you you.

09:00.707 --> 09:01.750
Do you understand?

09:03.752 --> 09:05.796
-I guess.

09:05.879 --> 09:06.838
-Okay.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.801
So, tell me about Kelly.
Where'd you two meet?

09:10.884 --> 09:13.387
-You read my questionnaire,
you know where we met.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.138
-It's not about where you met.

09:15.222 --> 09:19.184
It's about how you tell me
where you met.

09:19.268 --> 09:21.436
What it sounds like
in your voice.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.272
What I see in your eyes.

09:26.108 --> 09:28.694
-We met through friends.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.697
We were both living in L.A.
and...

09:31.780 --> 09:33.323
we went out on a date.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.409
Like they used to do
in the old days.

09:35.492 --> 09:38.495
We got together and...

09:38.578 --> 09:41.957
kind of never got
"untogether."

09:42.040 --> 09:43.750
-So what do I need to know
about Kelly?

09:43.834 --> 09:45.377
-What kind of question
is that?

09:45.460 --> 09:47.254
-The company gives us
a list of questions.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.547
This is one of them.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.841
What do I need to know
about Kelly?

09:50.924 --> 09:52.968
-This is so stupid.

09:55.304 --> 09:57.681
Okay.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.975
What you need to know
about Kelly is...

10:04.479 --> 10:06.273
she's allergic to meat.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.483
-[chuckles]
-Which, if you ask her,

10:08.567 --> 10:11.528
she'll tell you
that does not mean

10:11.611 --> 10:13.530
she's a vegetarian.

10:13.613 --> 10:18.952
She loves hamburgers and
pork chops, tenderloins.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.663
She just gets a nasty rash
afterwards.

10:21.747 --> 10:24.082
-So, do I cook her
a steak dinner or not?

10:24.166 --> 10:26.084
-[scoffs]
You're fucked either way.

10:26.168 --> 10:27.586
-[chuckles]

10:30.005 --> 10:31.048
What else?

10:33.717 --> 10:35.719
-Kelly loves to sing.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.265
But is so self-conscious
about it

10:40.349 --> 10:42.726
that she pretends she has
a terrible voice

10:42.809 --> 10:44.644
and won't even try.

10:47.189 --> 10:50.192
So you have to have Alexa
play show tunes

10:50.275 --> 10:55.322
like "Music Man" or
"Oklahoma!",

10:55.405 --> 10:57.783
"Guys And Dolls,"

10:57.866 --> 11:00.827
anything with Doris Day
or Vera Lynn.

11:00.911 --> 11:06.041
And then... [chuckles]

11:06.124 --> 11:08.502
She won't be able to
help herself.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.337
-[chuckles]

11:12.422 --> 11:14.341
-It's so beautiful.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.639
I'm gonna miss
hearing her sing.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.352
Gonna miss hearing
a lot of things.

11:31.608 --> 11:34.194
Kelly is a great mom.

11:37.697 --> 11:41.993
Like... a really great mom.

11:45.122 --> 11:48.125
She can anticipate anything.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.126
[sniffles]

11:49.209 --> 11:52.504
And the kids love
being around her.

11:52.587 --> 11:55.465
So you have to let her
give them their bath.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.427
You have to let her
put 'em to bed.

12:00.095 --> 12:04.474
You have to let her
read 'em their stories.

12:04.558 --> 12:08.353
And don't get upset if they
ask for her when they wake up,

12:08.437 --> 12:13.191
or if they ask for her
before they go to bed.

12:13.275 --> 12:15.735
Because they still
love you. Me.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.823
It's just different.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.996
And I can't get mad because...

12:26.079 --> 12:28.081
I would love her
more than me, too.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.003
-Hm.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.674
-I do love her more than me.

12:40.886 --> 12:43.972
That's why I paid
the 30 grand.

12:44.055 --> 12:46.349
[sniffles]

12:46.433 --> 12:48.143
When we saw the thing...

12:50.854 --> 12:52.689
Hoda Kotb was...

12:57.777 --> 13:01.698
I just didn't want her
to be alone.

13:01.781 --> 13:02.866
-Mm-hm.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.162
-[chuckles]

13:09.789 --> 13:11.208
Kelly farts, man.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.667
[laughing]

13:12.751 --> 13:15.003
God, she really does fart.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.547
It's the silent ones.
Code red.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.716
[laughing]

13:19.799 --> 13:22.302
Those are the ones
you gotta watch out for.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.429
Can you smell?
-Technically.

13:24.513 --> 13:27.807
-God. Then I apologize
ahead of time.

13:27.891 --> 13:30.560
-[laughs]

13:30.644 --> 13:32.270
-I'll even miss her farts.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.607
[both laughing]

13:37.817 --> 13:40.362
-What about Wilder?

13:40.445 --> 13:42.197
-Wilder.
-Mm-hm.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.741
-My boy.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.701
Wilder is a genius.

13:46.785 --> 13:50.997
Like, he... he's really smart.

13:51.081 --> 13:54.334
Now, you know how every parent
thinks their kid is a g...

13:54.417 --> 13:55.961
Well, you don't know,
but every parent thinks

13:56.044 --> 13:57.337
their kid is a genius,

13:57.420 --> 13:59.839
but Wilder really is,
I mean, he's...

14:02.759 --> 14:03.802
He's a genius.

14:06.221 --> 14:07.764
He's really kind.

14:10.433 --> 14:11.851
So kind.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.232
And he loves
not knowing things,

14:17.315 --> 14:20.735
which is really hard
because he's a genius.

14:20.819 --> 14:23.488
But he loves it.

14:23.572 --> 14:27.075
Because he loves
discovering new things.

14:27.158 --> 14:30.620
He'll go down
a Wikipedia worm hole

14:30.704 --> 14:32.122
for a week,

14:32.205 --> 14:37.794
and become an expert on
the most random things.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.298
Pez dispensers
and Micronesia.

14:49.723 --> 14:50.932
Or lymphoma.

14:54.394 --> 14:58.189
And he loves playing with
his action figures,

14:58.273 --> 14:59.608
making stories up,

14:59.691 --> 15:03.278
and I... I love watching him.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.238
But he gets embarrassed
if he knows...

15:05.322 --> 15:08.325
if he knows I'm there, so...

15:08.408 --> 15:09.784
I can't let him know.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.415
Sometimes,
when he knows I'm there,

15:15.498 --> 15:20.462
he'll call the figures
Dad and Wilder,

15:20.545 --> 15:24.549
and he'll make 'em go on
these incredible journeys,

15:26.009 --> 15:29.888
these incredible...
incredible adventures,

15:29.971 --> 15:32.474
all because he knows
I'm watching,

15:32.557 --> 15:35.477
and he knows
it makes me so happy.

15:37.312 --> 15:38.730
-I don't know, Tom.

15:39.397 --> 15:42.692
I don't know that
he knows you're watching.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.736
I think he just does that.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.240
-[sniffles]
Yeah.

15:50.575 --> 15:54.204
He loves when I get him
Rocky Road ice cream

15:54.287 --> 15:56.706
from Carvel.
[chuckles]

15:56.790 --> 16:00.877
And he hates when I'm
on the phone for work.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.340
I'm on the phone too much.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.176
-So I'll be on the phone
too much.

16:08.259 --> 16:09.260
-No.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.559
He'll be really strong
for Kelly and Peg.

16:21.231 --> 16:22.816
-And Peg.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.859
-[chuckles]

16:27.278 --> 16:29.948
Peg.

16:30.031 --> 16:33.368
She's the boss, man.
She's the commander in chief.

16:33.451 --> 16:37.747
My little girl, the... the...
the queen of the castle.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.165
And tough as nails.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.503
I remember when the adoption
agency brought her home,

16:43.586 --> 16:48.842
and I held her in my arms,
this... this little creature.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.094
I held her in my arms, man.

16:54.139 --> 16:55.974
And that little heartbeat

16:56.057 --> 17:00.645
told me everything
I needed to know;

17:00.729 --> 17:03.273
all the secrets,
all the instructions,

17:03.356 --> 17:06.943
and from then on...
[chuckles]

17:07.026 --> 17:08.069
She's like me.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.702
For better or for worse,

17:15.785 --> 17:17.036
she's a little me.

17:19.581 --> 17:22.792
[laughing]

17:22.876 --> 17:25.295
Peg won't go to bed

17:25.378 --> 17:31.718
unless you give her
three kisses on her cheek...

17:31.801 --> 17:36.306
two kisses on her forehead...

17:36.389 --> 17:38.433
and one little kiss
on her nose.

17:42.061 --> 17:46.149
And Peg's not scared
of anything.

17:46.232 --> 17:51.613
Which sounds like what you'd
want from your kids,

17:51.696 --> 17:53.490
but what you actually want
is for your kids

17:53.573 --> 17:56.159
to be scared of certain things.

17:56.242 --> 18:00.914
Like raccoons by the trashcan
or a hot stove or...

18:00.997 --> 18:04.250
speeding cars
or heights and...

18:04.334 --> 18:08.463
you just can't let her
out of your sight.

18:08.546 --> 18:09.589
Ever.

18:16.721 --> 18:19.224
Which seems like a task but...

18:22.894 --> 18:26.231
now... I wish...

18:26.314 --> 18:29.776
-You'll never have to let her
out of your sight again.

18:29.859 --> 18:33.947
-Oh. And me and Peg have this...
this secret handshake.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.658
So it's...

18:39.244 --> 18:41.621
One, two, three.

18:41.704 --> 18:44.624
One, two. One.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.627
You got it?

18:47.710 --> 18:48.795
Okay, faster.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.676
[chuckling]

18:57.262 --> 18:58.346
Yeah.

19:03.017 --> 19:05.103
-Well, it sounds nice.

19:07.188 --> 19:08.565
-What's that?

19:08.648 --> 19:10.400
-Being here.

19:10.483 --> 19:14.445
Being you,
just... being.

19:14.529 --> 19:15.572
-Yeah.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.408
It's nice.

19:20.535 --> 19:23.121
Sometimes hard.

19:23.204 --> 19:26.541
But I guess it beats
the alternative, right?

19:30.753 --> 19:32.672
-Tom.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.883
-Yeah, Tom?

19:34.966 --> 19:36.175
-I'm glad you're here.

19:38.261 --> 19:41.514
I'm happy that you...
you get to be.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.105
-I'm nervous.
-About what?

19:49.188 --> 19:52.859
-Well, that I won't be
just like you.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.862
That I'm gonna be
imperfect or...

19:55.945 --> 19:57.405
gonna do something wrong.

19:58.615 --> 20:00.199
-Then you'll be just like me.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.205
Shit, I'm nervous, too.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.749
-About what?

20:07.832 --> 20:11.002
-That you'll be just like me.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.921
-I don't understand.

20:13.004 --> 20:15.548
-Yeah, and then they'll
forget about me.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.301
-They'll never forget you.

20:18.384 --> 20:21.262
-How do you know?

20:21.346 --> 20:25.642
-Because I'll make sure that
I won't be just like you;

20:25.725 --> 20:28.645
that when Peg asks for
a kiss goodnight,

20:28.728 --> 20:32.357
I'll give her two kisses on
the cheek instead of three.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.902
And when Wilder
asks for Carvel,

20:35.985 --> 20:38.363
I'll bring him
Cookies and Cream

20:38.446 --> 20:40.990
instead of Rocky Road.
-[chuckles]

20:42.116 --> 20:44.994
-And when Kelly farts loudly,

20:45.078 --> 20:46.537
I'll call it a code red

20:46.621 --> 20:49.082
that just for a moment...
-[chuckling]

20:50.750 --> 20:53.544
-They'll remember.

20:53.628 --> 20:56.839
And I might look like you,
sound like you,

20:56.923 --> 20:59.258
feel like you, but...

21:01.427 --> 21:02.637
I'm not you.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.098
Never will be.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.434
I never could be.

21:09.394 --> 21:13.064
-But what if...
what if they send you back?

21:13.147 --> 21:15.066
What if they say
there's an error,

21:15.149 --> 21:16.776
and they have to send
a new you,

21:16.859 --> 21:18.987
and you have to teach him
how to be Tom?

21:19.988 --> 21:22.156
-Yeah, but I still would have
been Kelly's husband.

21:23.866 --> 21:27.328
I still would have been
Wilder and Peg's dad.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.915
I still would have been.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.960
For a little while.

21:36.838 --> 21:39.424
-And you know...
You know what else?

21:39.507 --> 21:41.467
You know what I realize?

21:41.551 --> 21:42.885
-What's that, Tom?

21:45.388 --> 21:47.807
-You're the luckiest man
in the world.

21:50.727 --> 21:53.563
-Well, that makes you...
-That's right.

21:54.439 --> 21:55.481
I think I am.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.322
-We're out of time, Tom.

22:03.406 --> 22:06.993
-Yeah, I've been hearing that
a lot lately.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.995
-Anything else
you want to add?

22:09.078 --> 22:10.872
-Everything.

22:10.955 --> 22:13.791
I want to add... everything.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.838
But there isn't time,
is there?

22:24.010 --> 22:25.219
See?

22:27.180 --> 22:28.639
This is what I imagined.

22:28.723 --> 22:30.516
[chuckling]

22:30.600 --> 22:33.770
When I saw the Hoda Kotb thing,
when I called...

22:36.397 --> 22:37.690
This feels right.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.655
-Tom.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.032
-Yeah.

22:47.617 --> 22:50.078
-I'm sorry I called you
an asshole.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.246
-I am an asshole.

22:52.330 --> 22:55.500
-No. You're just a person.

22:55.583 --> 22:56.959
A human being.

22:58.294 --> 23:01.881
That isn't always easy.
And that's okay.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.259
-And, Tom.
-Yeah.

23:06.761 --> 23:08.179
-I'm glad I got you.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.433
I mean, I'm glad I'm you.

23:14.102 --> 23:15.144

23:18.731 --> 23:19.774
Me, too.
