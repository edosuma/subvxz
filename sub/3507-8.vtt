00:47.800 --> 00:50.300
All right, everybody,
last hand for the night.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.600
Aw... phooey.
It's only... ah!

00:53.700 --> 00:54.800
It's not even midnight.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.600
Some people have jobs
to go to in the morning.

00:56.600 --> 01:01.500
Oh, my son,
the working stiff.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.099
Phooey.
I fold.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.600
If you don't mind me saying,
mrs. R., you fold a lot.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.800
I just don't believe in
stringing along a bad hand.

01:09.800 --> 01:10.900
Why waste time?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Actually, mother's
game isn't really texas hold'em.

01:13.000 --> 01:13.900
It's strip poker.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.700
Keeps things humming along,
if you know what i mean.

01:15.700 --> 01:19.000
Well, frankly, i prefer strip,
because even when you lose, you win.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.200
Raise $20.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.000
Call.

01:27.100 --> 01:28.400
Make it a hundred.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.900
Whoa.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.400
- 100 bucks?
- Man up, bro.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.100
Really?

01:36.800 --> 01:38.900
- I'm out.
- Slop.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.900
What about you, castle?
You're already in for the blind.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.700
Not scared of a little...

01:43.900 --> 01:45.900
Action, are you?

01:47.200 --> 01:49.700
"Action"
is my middle name.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.500
Don't worry, sweetheart,
he's bluffing.

01:53.500 --> 01:54.800
Whenever he blinks too much,

01:54.800 --> 01:56.000
It means
he's got a lousy hand.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.500
- Mother.
- Well...

01:57.700 --> 01:58.800
All right,
here we go.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.900
There it is.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.400
Uh-Oh.

02:10.600 --> 02:11.100
What?

02:11.100 --> 02:12.700
He's not blinking,
but now he's tapping,

02:12.700 --> 02:14.700
Which means
he might have the nuts.

02:15.500 --> 02:16.100
What's the matter?

02:16.100 --> 02:18.700
You're not afraid
of a little action, are you?

02:24.200 --> 02:25.300
All in.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.900
- Take him down, beckett.
- Yeah, make him pay.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.400
Can't write your way
out of this one, huh, castle?

02:50.200 --> 02:51.000
Way to go, beckett.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.800
Maybe someone should change
their middle name to "loser."

02:54.900 --> 02:56.000
- Loser.
- What can i say?

02:56.000 --> 02:57.600
Guess it just
wasn't my night.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.500
Ah, see, i told you
he was bluffing.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.400
It's the...

03:00.400 --> 03:02.000
It's the blinking thing,
yeah, you're right.

03:03.700 --> 03:04.800
Beckett.

03:06.900 --> 03:08.300
Yeah, we'll be there
in 20.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.200
Homicide
on henry street.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.700
I'll take care of
this for you.

03:12.700 --> 03:13.300
Thank you.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.300
Well, at least you
guys are already downtown.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.100
But it's after midnight.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.600
Murder never sleeps,
mrs. R.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.200
Yeah, neither do we.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.900
Someone say "murder"?

03:22.100 --> 03:23.800
Hold on, i'll get my coat.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.200
Look at him,
all excited.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.200
Yeah, like a kid
at christmas.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.100
With a dead body
under the tree.

03:29.600 --> 03:34.900
Castle
S01E08

03:45.500 --> 03:47.600
- Is that motor oil?
- Looks like it,

03:47.600 --> 03:50.700
But i'll have to pump out the tub
and run some tests to be sure.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.400
It's motor oil, all right.
10w-40.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.000
Empties in the closet.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.200
What kind of a freak drowns
a woman in motor oil?

03:57.200 --> 03:58.900
Someone's trying
to send a message.

04:05.100 --> 04:06.900
I already told
the uniforms.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.300
Once people check in,

04:08.300 --> 04:10.000
I don't wanna know
what they do up there.

04:10.100 --> 04:12.500
Her purse was missing, and she
didn't have an i.D. On her.

04:12.500 --> 04:15.100
Any chance she paid for
the room with a credit card?

04:16.700 --> 04:17.800
All i can tell you is,

04:17.800 --> 04:21.000
Whoever rented the room on friday
paid cash for a 5-Day stay.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.800
They were
supposed to be out tonight.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.200
So at midnight,
i went up to check

04:24.200 --> 04:26.800
If the place was empty
and found her in the tub.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.200
It's gonna be
a bitch to clean it.

04:28.300 --> 04:29.900
So if anybody was
meeting her here--

04:29.900 --> 04:32.600
It's not like the guests
arrive and i ring them up.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.100
This ain't the ritz.

04:34.200 --> 04:34.900
Clearly.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.500
What about tonight?
Anyone strange coming in or going out?

04:37.800 --> 04:38.900
Hey, bill.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.200
Jasmine,
how's it hangin'?

04:43.400 --> 04:45.900
I think you just described
half their clientele.

04:47.300 --> 04:50.600
Unidentified woman--
Early 40s, good health.

04:50.700 --> 04:53.400
She's wearing a wedding ring,
but there's no inscription.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.200
Cause of death?
Drowning.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.900
And there's a nasty contusion
on the back of her head.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.700
So somebody hit her
hard enough to knock her out

04:59.700 --> 05:01.300
And then gave her
a motor oil bath.

05:01.400 --> 05:04.800
And i found this
in one of her pockets.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Ticket stub
for the metro-North.

05:07.100 --> 05:10.100
Our victim took the train in
from westchester yesterday morning.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.000
Westchester to lower manhattan?

05:12.100 --> 05:14.200
That's a long way to go
for a lube job.

05:14.900 --> 05:17.300
See, when married ladies
go to cheap hotels,

05:17.300 --> 05:19.000
It's always about sex.

05:19.100 --> 05:19.900
Or drugs.

05:19.900 --> 05:23.700
The sample in one of the wine glasses
tested positive for remian.

05:24.100 --> 05:25.300
A sleeping pill.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.400
This was not
a crime of passion.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.900
That room was rented
for five days

05:29.900 --> 05:32.100
And someone stocked
the place up with motor oil.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.400
That takes planning.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.700
And nice suburban ladies don't
just take the train into the city

05:36.700 --> 05:39.300
And not return
without somebody noticing.

05:40.300 --> 05:43.200
Irvington p.D. Logged a call
last night from a michael goldman

05:43.200 --> 05:45.000
Wanting to report
his wife allison missing.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.500
Clothing and description match.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.700
Said she went into the city
for work and never came back.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.000
Said he knew
that something was wrong.

05:51.100 --> 05:54.800
Poor guy.
Unless he's the killer...

05:54.800 --> 05:56.800
And he's covering his tracks
by calling the police

05:57.000 --> 05:58.200
Before the body's discovered.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.500
How about we question him
before we convict him?

06:00.500 --> 06:01.700
You got an address?

06:02.500 --> 06:03.900
- Thanks.
- Yep.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.400
I don't un-Understand.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.500
Wh-Where did you say
that she was found?

06:11.000 --> 06:12.700
At an s.R.O.
In the city.

06:13.400 --> 06:16.600
It's a single room occupancy.
It's like a transient hotel.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.600
Why would she be
in a place like that?

06:18.600 --> 06:20.600
Can you think of anyone she
might've been meeting?

06:20.900 --> 06:21.700
No.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.400
My wife and i were
happily married, detective.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.800
We had no secrets.

06:24.900 --> 06:28.500
You told police last night that
your wife went into the city for her job?

06:28.700 --> 06:30.400
She was working part-Time.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.700
We'd had some financial setbacks
the last few years.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.200
I'd been laid off,
and we had to give up the apartment.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.300
How did your wife handle
the move to the suburbs?

06:38.500 --> 06:40.500
Not, uh,
not too well.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.700
Allison missed the city,
so a couple months ago,

06:42.700 --> 06:46.200
She got a job working three days a week
at a clothing boutique in manhattan--

06:46.300 --> 06:49.400
This little place on 72nd
called lehane's.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.600
She said that being there...

06:58.900 --> 06:59.500
I'm sorry.

06:59.500 --> 07:04.300
She said that being there
reminded her of the good old days.

07:07.900 --> 07:12.400
So i'm trying to put together a timeline
of allison goldman's last hours.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.300
First call i make is to lehane's,
the store where she worked.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.000
I say to the owner,
"good morning, sir,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.700
I'd like to talk to you about your
employee-- Allison goldman."

07:19.800 --> 07:20.500
And?

07:20.500 --> 07:23.200
And he says, "who?"

07:24.200 --> 07:25.600
Allison didn't work there.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.100
Not yesterday,
not ever.

07:27.100 --> 07:29.500
Well, if she wasn't going into the city
three times a week for a job,

07:29.500 --> 07:30.800
Then what was she doing there?

07:30.800 --> 07:34.400
And how did she come home friday night
with 400 bucks in cash for the family kitty?

07:34.500 --> 07:36.500
Maybe castle was right.
Maybe this was about sex.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.100
The lady was a soccer mom.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.800
Come by my daughter's school
about 3:30.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.200
The place is like happy hour.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.200
Maybe she had a boyfriend.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.000
Yes, a boyfriend--

07:45.000 --> 07:49.700
Someone she met in line at zabar's
or, uh, one afternoon at the museum

07:49.800 --> 07:52.000
When she, uh, ducked in to
escape a rainstorm.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.100
Maybe it was someone
she already knew from the city,

07:54.100 --> 07:57.300
Someone who reminded her
of when times were good,

07:57.300 --> 08:00.700
Before she had to give up that cute apartment
with the partial river view.

08:00.700 --> 08:02.400
Someone who was
slipping her a little cash

08:02.400 --> 08:04.600
While he was slipping her
something else.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.800
Yeah, allison goldman wouldn't
have some cheap affair.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.100
This person would've had
to have meant something to her...

08:09.100 --> 08:11.900
Someone who cared for her,
someone who listened to her.

08:11.900 --> 08:15.700
Only now he wanted a little more
return for his investment,

08:15.700 --> 08:17.000
Something
she wasn't willing to do.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.600
Like leave her husband.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.900
And when she wouldn't,
then he got violent.

08:21.000 --> 08:21.500
Yep.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.300
You know,
i feel so stupid.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.100
Here i am looking for evidence,

08:25.100 --> 08:27.600
And all i had to do
was just make something up.

08:27.700 --> 08:30.500
So this imaginary
boyfriend killer--

08:30.500 --> 08:32.799
Do you think that he has
an imaginary address?

08:32.799 --> 08:34.299
Detective beckett?

08:35.799 --> 08:38.799
Mr. Goldman,
what is it?

08:41.500 --> 08:43.799
My lawyer called
the social security office this morning

08:43.799 --> 08:46.800
To let them know
that allison had passed away.

08:47.100 --> 08:50.200
He faxed this to me
two hours ago.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.100
- A death certificate?
- Yeah. For allison porter.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.000
Now porter was
my wife's maiden name.

08:57.400 --> 09:01.200
But it says here that
allison porter died in 1963.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.500
When she was 3 months old.

09:03.800 --> 09:08.400
But this child's social security number
is the same as my wife's.

09:10.700 --> 09:13.500
My wife wasn't the woman
she said she was.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.700
Our whole life together...

09:15.900 --> 09:17.600
Was a lie.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.800
So for 20 years,

09:27.100 --> 09:30.200
This woman was living
under a false name?

09:30.300 --> 09:31.300
That's crazy.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.300
Yeah, her husband
was pretty shaken up.

09:33.300 --> 09:34.600
Trust me
on this one, kiddo.

09:34.600 --> 09:37.000
When a woman marries a man
and doesn't bother to tell him

09:37.000 --> 09:38.900
Who she is for 20 years,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.600
She's a criminal--
Mata hari, shady lady.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.600
In other words,
a very good actress.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.300
Speaking of which,

09:45.300 --> 09:47.600
You seem to have inherited
a bit of my talent.

09:47.600 --> 09:48.500
Oh?
How so?

09:48.500 --> 09:51.000
The poker game.
You let beckett win.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.500
I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.100
Come on.
I checked your cards.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.800
I- I didn't want to take her money
in front of all her friends.

10:02.800 --> 10:07.000
Kate beckett is not some bimbo who needs big,
strong you to look out for her.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.100
She's a real woman.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.100
And a real woman does not
want to be patronized.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.800
- She's right, dad.
- Yeah.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.400
I was being nice.

10:15.800 --> 10:16.900
Castle.

10:17.900 --> 10:19.700
Yeah,
i'm on my way.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.600
All right, i'm on my way
to the precinct to find out

10:22.600 --> 10:25.600
Who this mata hari
really was.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.800
Allison goldman's
e- Mail account.

10:27.900 --> 10:28.800
Allison writes,

10:28.800 --> 10:31.900
"Lee, can we meet on tuesday
instead this week?"

10:31.900 --> 10:34.400
Lee writes back, "sounds good.
The usual place."

10:34.500 --> 10:36.500
Tuesday. The day
that she was murdered.

10:36.600 --> 10:40.900
So allison's imaginary boyfriend
has a very real e-Mail account.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.900
He goes by the screen name
"lwax220."

10:43.900 --> 10:45.600
The husband said
it didn't sound familiar to him.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.200
We cyber-Tracked it down.

10:47.300 --> 10:49.800
Check this castle--
The guy's a writer.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.700
A real writer or an "i took a course
at the learning annex" writer?

10:52.800 --> 10:55.000
Well, his name is lee wax.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.700
He writes true crime.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.400
"Bobby socks and blood--

10:58.400 --> 11:01.800
"The true story of a cheerleader
and eagle scout

11:01.800 --> 11:04.300
And the murder
that shocked america."

11:04.500 --> 11:05.300
Gimme a break.

11:05.300 --> 11:08.000
Well, maybe he got tired of
writing about other people's murders

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
And decided to commit one
on his own.

11:19.300 --> 11:20.200
What's this?

11:20.400 --> 11:22.100
Your winnings
from the other night.

11:22.400 --> 11:23.300
I'm not an idiot.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.600
I know you threw
the last hand.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.900
How did you
figure it out?

11:29.900 --> 11:31.200
That's not the point.

11:31.300 --> 11:33.200
Oh, my mother called you,
didn't she?

11:33.400 --> 11:35.200
You owe me a rematch.

11:36.900 --> 11:39.300
Fine. You wanna play?
Let's play.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.700
How about tomorrow night?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.500
With your mystery buddies?

11:42.900 --> 11:43.500
What, are you kidding?

11:43.500 --> 11:45.300
No, no, no, those guys
would eat you alive.

11:45.300 --> 11:47.800
No, i was thinking of something
a little more local.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.500
My, uh, gotham city crew.
Guys i beat on a regular basis.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.100
Your gotham city crew.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.400
Yeah, the captain,
the mayor and judge markway--

11:55.400 --> 11:58.100
You know, your boss, your boss' boss
and the guy that signs your warrants.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.400
Or would that
make you nervous?

11:59.400 --> 12:00.800
I mean, i wouldn't want
to throw your game.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.700
But i also don't want
you to feel patronized.

12:02.800 --> 12:06.800
Just set it up and
prepare to get your ass kicked.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.500
Hello?

12:21.800 --> 12:22.900
Hello?

12:40.700 --> 12:42.400
Look who's stalking.

12:43.900 --> 12:45.100
Stay here.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.300
Hey!
Who the hell are you?

12:58.500 --> 12:59.400
Who the hell are you?

12:59.500 --> 13:02.200
Lee wax. What are you doing
in my apartment?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.300
You're a woman.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.500
Either you tell me
who you are right now,

13:06.500 --> 13:08.600
Or i am calling
the cops.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.300
I am the cops.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.000
My name is
detective kate beckett.

13:12.300 --> 13:15.200
We would like to ask you
some questions about allison goldman.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.800
Allison. Oh.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.300
Just...

13:20.500 --> 13:22.800
Just, uh, let me get
my lawyer.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.700
Why do you need a lawyer?

13:24.800 --> 13:26.100
Why do you think?

13:26.300 --> 13:27.900
So you're confessing.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.200
No, i'm not confessing
to anything. It's just...

13:31.300 --> 13:34.000
My publisher instructed me
not to talk to law enforcement

13:34.000 --> 13:35.800
Until i had
a lawyer present.

13:35.800 --> 13:36.800
Your publisher?

13:36.800 --> 13:38.600
You know, i would like
to state for the record

13:38.600 --> 13:42.400
That i never harbored,
nor did i conceal, a fugitive.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.400
- What are you talking about?
- Allison goldman.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.800
If that's why you're here,
then obviously you found her.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.700
Yes.
Murdered.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.200
Murdered?

13:53.500 --> 13:54.900
Murdered by who?

13:54.900 --> 13:57.700
Well, given your unhealthy
obsession for her,

13:57.700 --> 14:00.900
I'm going to take
a wild stab at... you.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
Me?

14:03.300 --> 14:05.000
No,
i am a ghostwriter.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.700
We were working
on her memoir.

14:06.800 --> 14:07.300
Memoir?

14:07.300 --> 14:09.700
Why would allison goldman
need a memoir?

14:10.300 --> 14:12.800
Wait. So you don't know
who she really is?

14:13.200 --> 14:14.600
We do now.

14:15.000 --> 14:19.100
Apparently, our westchester housewife
was also a fugitive.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.200
That's allison goldman?

14:23.300 --> 14:24.900
A.K.A. Cynthia dern.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.900
In 1989, she and two friends set off a bomb
on a tanker owned by a big oil company.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.200
I remember this.

14:31.500 --> 14:34.000
Some radical environmentalists
protesting the "exxon valdez" spill.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.800
Yes. One was killed,
one was caught.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.800
But cynthia dern
was never found.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.100
Looks like her past
finally caught up with her.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.500
Jared swanstrom, uh,
built the bomb.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.800
Susan mailer and cynthia
snuck onboard to set it,

14:44.800 --> 14:47.000
Only something went wrong.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.400
You see, the ship was supposed
to be empty of oil and people,

14:50.400 --> 14:53.700
But the captain, sam pike,
had come back.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.900
He was paralyzed
in the explosion.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.600
How did you
track down cynthia?

14:57.700 --> 15:01.300
I didn't.
She contacted me.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.900
Cynthia had decided
to turn herself in,

15:03.900 --> 15:05.300
But before she surrendered,

15:05.300 --> 15:07.300
She wanted to get
her story out to the public

15:07.300 --> 15:08.800
And express her remorse.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.900
And get public opinion
on her side.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.900
It's a great way to influence
a potential jury pool.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.000
But she did it, right?

15:15.000 --> 15:16.900
So how was she planning on
influencing them?

15:16.900 --> 15:19.600
Cynthia told me that
on the night of the bombing,

15:19.600 --> 15:21.400
She had tried to back out.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.400
When she realized
that the captain was aboard,

15:23.400 --> 15:25.300
She argued with susan mailer
to call it off,

15:25.300 --> 15:26.600
But susan refused.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.500
Susan went
to set the bomb herself

15:28.500 --> 15:31.500
And ironically,
died in the explosion.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.800
She was vaporized.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.900
So why would
she come out of hiding now?

15:37.000 --> 15:37.900
Money.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.500
She need the cash.

15:39.700 --> 15:40.600
You were paying her?

15:40.600 --> 15:44.000
A couple hundred a week.
If the book had sold well...

15:45.000 --> 15:48.300
I don't have to tell you
how much money was at stake.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.600
When was the last time
you saw cynthia?

15:54.700 --> 15:56.200
Tuesday afternoon.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.600
Did she mention that she was
going to see anyone else,

16:00.600 --> 16:02.500
Maybe someone from her past?

16:02.500 --> 16:03.500
No, no,

16:03.500 --> 16:07.500
Cynthia was really paranoid about
being discovered before the book came out.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.200
She didn't want me to get in touch
with anyone from her old life.

16:10.300 --> 16:11.800
But you did,
anyway.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.500
Any true crime writer
worth their salt

16:14.500 --> 16:17.800
Is gonna check her story
with other sources.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.900
Okay,
so i made a few calls.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.700
Thw sources
That you were talking to,

16:23.700 --> 16:25.400
Did any of them want
her dead?

16:25.400 --> 16:29.000
Maybe, but...remember,
nobody knew how to find her.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.200
I mean,i didn't even know
where she lived.

16:31.500 --> 16:34.900
I'm gonna need to see your
interview notes and your manuscript.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.300
You can have
whatever you want,

16:39.300 --> 16:41.800
But in return, i'd like to
be kept in the loop

16:41.800 --> 16:43.400
As the investigation proceeds.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.300
What for?

16:44.400 --> 16:46.000
My book.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.200
You're gonna go
through with it?

16:48.300 --> 16:49.500
But cynthia's dead.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.100
Correction--
Cynthia was murdered,

16:51.100 --> 16:54.400
Which means her memoir
just became a true crime story,

16:54.400 --> 16:55.900
Which is kind of
my forte.

16:55.900 --> 16:58.000
You'd be doing me
a huge favor.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.800
You know,
i- I would love to.

17:00.400 --> 17:03.300
But i have a whole list
of writers

17:03.300 --> 17:06.000
Who are hanging around,
looking for favors.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
So thank you very much, though,
for cooperating, and i'll...

17:09.000 --> 17:10.800
Catch you
on the dark side.

17:18.700 --> 17:19.800
It's a pretty sweet gig

17:19.800 --> 17:22.099
You've scored for yourself,
mr. Castle.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.599
Is this your secret
to writing best sellers--

17:25.000 --> 17:28.600
Follow the pretty cop lady around
and take copious notes?

17:28.700 --> 17:31.100
I like to think talent
played a small part.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.700
Still, this is the kind of all-Access
pass most writers would kill for.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.500
Let's get to the part
where you tell me what you want.

17:38.300 --> 17:41.200
Well, maybe you can give me
a call sometime...

17:41.300 --> 17:44.300
One professional to another.

17:45.100 --> 17:47.700
Or do you need to check
with your boss lady?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Why don't you give me
your number,

17:50.100 --> 17:52.000
And i'll see
what i can do?

18:01.300 --> 18:04.100
A domestic terrorist
who clips coupons.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.400
I just might buy
the movie rights myself.

18:06.500 --> 18:09.600
Well, the bombing obviously wasn't
a very sophisticated operation.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.600
Susan mailer was killed
in the blast,

18:11.600 --> 18:13.800
And jared swanstrom
was caught by the fbi

18:13.800 --> 18:15.600
And served 15 years.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.700
Allison goldman,
a.K.A. Cynthia dern,

18:17.700 --> 18:20.100
Managed to stay a fugitive
for nearly two decades.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.700
And then she poked her head
out of hiding,

18:21.700 --> 18:24.100
And a couple months later,
she's dead.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.100
Well, who would hold
a grudge for 20 years?

18:30.300 --> 18:32.700
How about the people
whose lives she's ruined?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
You say she was
living in irvington?

18:39.200 --> 18:41.500
That's just a couple
of miles away from here.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.300
In the months
leading up to her death,

18:43.300 --> 18:45.700
Cynthia was working
with a journalist.

18:45.700 --> 18:48.700
We spoke with lee wax
several times.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.300
She never told us
cynthia was involved.

18:51.300 --> 18:53.100
She should have.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.600
Excuse me, will you?
Excuse me, please.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.300
This is hard for him.

19:02.500 --> 19:05.600
He's still angry about
what happened. We all are.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.600
This your son?

19:08.300 --> 19:09.200
Adam.

19:09.300 --> 19:11.100
He's a sailor,
just like his dad.

19:11.200 --> 19:15.100
The settlement wasn't enough to
cover all of sam's medical costs.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.500
Adam's been working
and helping out

19:17.500 --> 19:19.300
Since he was a teenager.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
Adam?

19:25.700 --> 19:27.100
I'm detective kate beckett.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.500
Is this about her?

19:29.100 --> 19:32.500
Cynthia or allison or whatever
she called herself?

19:32.600 --> 19:35.000
Did you have any idea
that she lived so close?

19:35.100 --> 19:36.800
Didn't know,
didn't care.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.300
You didn't care about the woman
who almost killed your father?

19:41.300 --> 19:43.400
I find that hard to believe.

19:43.500 --> 19:45.600
You know,
my family waited 20 years

19:45.600 --> 19:47.500
For the cops
to find cynthia dern

19:47.600 --> 19:50.500
So my dad could get
just a little bit of justice.

19:50.700 --> 19:52.600
Well, it's too late
for that now.

19:52.700 --> 19:54.100
So what do you want
from us?

19:54.300 --> 19:57.300
Well, i thought you might want
to know how cynthia died.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.900
She was drowned
in motor oil.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.400
Motor oil?

19:57.900 --> 20:00.800
She was drowned in motor oil.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.200
Motor oil?

20:02.200 --> 20:06.100
It's almost as if whoever did it had
a personal connection to the bombing.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.900
Adam, if i looked in your garage
right now, would i find motor oil?

20:13.100 --> 20:15.300
I own a boat and a car, detective.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.500
And where were you last tuesday?

20:18.000 --> 20:21.600
I bartend at the foxtail grill
on manchester every tuesday.

20:23.600 --> 20:24.700
Are we done?

20:25.300 --> 20:27.400
Yes, for now.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.200
Thank you.

20:31.300 --> 20:32.300
You know what?

20:32.500 --> 20:35.100
I hope his alibi checks out.
I hope he didn't do it.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.400
And here i thought you would be saying

20:36.400 --> 20:39.300
What a great story it would
make if adam pike did it--

20:39.300 --> 20:41.700
A son taking revenge for his father.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.400
It is a good story. It's agreatstory.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.600
Personally, i would just write a
happier ending for that family.

20:45.600 --> 20:49.000
Beckett. Fbi files on the
tanker bombing in '89--

20:49.500 --> 20:51.100
- I've been going through them.
- And?

20:51.200 --> 20:53.500
Three days after the bombing,
they captured jared swanstrom

20:53.500 --> 20:55.000
At a motel where he'd been hiding out.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
Feds had a tip line.
Some helpful citizen calls

20:58.000 --> 21:00.100
And said they'd seen swanstrom at the motel.

21:00.200 --> 21:04.200
- Feds go in, grab him up, easy peasy.
- It's pretty standard stuff.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.600
Yeah, until you get to the part where
the tipster never collects onthe reward.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.900
And who was the tipster?

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
That's just it. The fbi never knew
'cause she didn't leave a name.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.200
- She?
- Mm-Hmm.

21:15.200 --> 21:18.700
Records describe the
voice as young and female.

21:18.700 --> 21:20.400
It could be cynthia dern.

21:21.300 --> 21:23.200
Do you think she would give
up her friends to the cops?

21:23.200 --> 21:24.500
Doesn't matter what i think.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.600
It only matters what swanstrom thought.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.400
The guy did 15 years in prison.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.700
That's a long time to
think about who put you there.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.600
- Jared swanstrom?
- Yeah?

21:43.500 --> 21:46.500
Nypd. We'd like to ask you
some questions about cynthia dern.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.600
Well, i'm not sure what i can tell you.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.200
I haven't seen her in 20 years.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.000
But you knew she was writing a book, right?

21:53.600 --> 21:55.900
- You spoke to lee wax.
- I spoke with her.

21:56.100 --> 22:00.100
- I- I told her to give cynthia my regards.
- So you weren't bearing any old grudges?

22:00.800 --> 22:03.000
Against cynthia? What for?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.400
For turning you in.

22:05.100 --> 22:07.400
It was cynthia who called the
cops the night you were arrested.

22:09.100 --> 22:11.700
Well, if that's true, she was
just trying to save herself.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.500
Right after the bombing,
cynthia wanted to run--

22:14.500 --> 22:15.600
You know, try to make it to canada.

22:15.600 --> 22:19.500
- But i, uh, i fell apart.
- Why?

22:19.900 --> 22:22.600
Guilt. I'm the one who built the bomb.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.600
- I'm the one who messed it up.
- Messed it up how?

22:25.600 --> 22:28.700
The girls were supposed to have three minutes
to get off that ship before it went off--

22:28.800 --> 22:29.800
Three minutes.

22:29.800 --> 22:32.700
When cynthia got back in the car that night,
she said that something had gone wrong,

22:33.400 --> 22:35.900
That the bomb had-- Had blown early.

22:39.100 --> 22:41.300
I'm the reason that susan mailer is dead.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.600
At least one of them took responsibility

22:50.600 --> 22:52.200
For what happened that night.

22:52.300 --> 22:55.200
Yeah. Maybe even a little
too much responsibility.

22:56.300 --> 22:58.600
You don't believe jared swanstrom's story?

22:58.600 --> 23:01.000
Well, that's the thing. It's
not his story. It's cynthia's.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.300
You wanna break it down for those of
us who've already had a glass of wine?

23:04.700 --> 23:07.600
Cynthia told lee wax
that she and susan mailer

23:07.600 --> 23:09.600
Had an argument as to whether
or not to set off the bomb

23:09.600 --> 23:11.700
Once they knew the captain was onboard.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.000
Cynthia backed out.

23:13.000 --> 23:17.000
Susan went on to set off the
bomb by herself and... boom.

23:17.600 --> 23:18.200
Huh.

23:18.200 --> 23:22.200
But today, jared swanstrom said that cynthia
told him there was something wrong with the timer.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.300
She never said anything about an argument.

23:24.300 --> 23:27.400
Oh... well, that is a rather glaring omission.

23:27.800 --> 23:30.400
You know, when i'm writing,
i find it's all about choices--

23:30.400 --> 23:31.900
What to put in, what to leave out,

23:31.900 --> 23:35.000
When to reveal some information,
when to hold something back.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.700
But as someone else's
ghostwriter, you only know

23:38.200 --> 23:39.400
What they want you to know.

23:39.400 --> 23:42.300
But lee wax isn't cynthia's
ghostwriter anymore, right?

23:43.200 --> 23:45.500
Now that she's dead,
it's no longer a memoir.

23:46.100 --> 23:47.300
It's a true crime story.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.200
And it sounds like the true story

23:49.200 --> 23:51.700
Is a whole lot juicier than cynthia's lies.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.100
Good morning.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.900
Oh. Hey.

24:04.100 --> 24:05.300
Sorry. I've just...

24:05.300 --> 24:07.800
Been going over lee wax's interview notes.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.800
When she spoke to jared swanstrom,

24:10.800 --> 24:12.800
He told her the same thing he told us.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.600
Cynthia said the bomb blew early,

24:14.600 --> 24:15.900
But she left that version out of her book.

24:15.900 --> 24:18.800
That's because it contradicted
cynthia's latest story,

24:18.800 --> 24:20.200
That the girls argued when they discovered

24:20.200 --> 24:23.900
That captain pike was still onboard
and that susan set the bomb alone.

24:23.900 --> 24:25.400
According to the publisher,

24:25.400 --> 24:29.100
Cynthia has full approval
over everything lee wax wrote.

24:29.100 --> 24:30.200
It was her way or the highway.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.800
You talked to the publisher?

24:32.100 --> 24:35.600
I am... somewhatknown in those circles.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.500
Anyway, they didn't like it.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.400
They were looking for a true crime tell-All,

24:39.400 --> 24:40.300
And what they were getting

24:40.300 --> 24:43.700
Was some sanitized bunch
of remorseful boohooing.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.400
- They were getting ready to pull the plug.
- And now?

24:45.400 --> 24:48.000
Well, now that cynthia's murder is all
over the media, they're back onboard,

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
So long as the book takes
a more sensationalized angle--

24:51.200 --> 24:52.900
"Kaboom! The true story

24:52.900 --> 24:55.300
"Of a domestic terrorist
turned suburban housewife

24:55.300 --> 24:57.800
And the crime that shocked america."

24:57.800 --> 24:59.100
- Catchy.
- Thanks.

24:59.500 --> 25:01.000
So with cynthia out of the way,

25:01.100 --> 25:03.700
Lee wax is sitting on
a potential best seller.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.400
People have killed for a lot less.

25:10.000 --> 25:10.900
Beckett.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
All right, bring him in.

25:17.300 --> 25:18.000
What?

25:18.200 --> 25:19.900
Adam pike's alibi fell apart.

25:19.900 --> 25:22.200
He was lying about being
at work on tuesday night.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.500
I didn't kill her.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.700
I didn't even know where she was.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.800
We're not gonna get anywhere
if you keep lying to me.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.000
I know you went to westchester.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.700
I spoke to cynthia's husband.

25:34.700 --> 25:37.600
He rembers seeing a guy just
like you outside their house

25:37.600 --> 25:39.500
A couple weeks before she was murdered.

25:42.100 --> 25:43.300
Don't make me put you in the lineup.

25:43.300 --> 25:44.400
I just...

25:46.800 --> 25:48.200
Wanted to talk to her.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.400
- How'd you find her?
- That writer.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.200
The way she kept talking
about what happened to my dad--

25:53.200 --> 25:56.500
She knew things that only
someone on that ship could know.

25:57.900 --> 25:58.600
So i...

25:58.600 --> 26:00.100
Started following her around.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.400
Eventually, she led me to cynthia dern.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.200
And why didn't you call the police?

26:04.200 --> 26:06.400
Because i wanted to look her in the eye.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.500
I wanted to tell her none of it mattered.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.700
Her blood money wouldn't buy our forgiveness.

26:12.100 --> 26:13.000
What money?

26:13.000 --> 26:14.800
What do you mean by "blood money"?

26:14.800 --> 26:18.000
After i found out where cynthia
lived, i went and told my mom.

26:18.300 --> 26:20.500
I didn't know if we should
call the feds or what.

26:21.400 --> 26:22.400
She started crying.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.900
She told me we'd been getting
money every month since the bombing.

26:24.900 --> 26:27.500
Different amounts-- Sometimes
more, sometimes less--

26:27.500 --> 26:28.900
But every month.

26:28.900 --> 26:31.600
And she thought that the money
was coming from cynthia dern?

26:31.800 --> 26:33.700
The first envelope, there was a note.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.600
"Please forgive me."

26:36.300 --> 26:38.500
Susan mailer was dead.
Swanstrom was in prison.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.400
There wasn't anybody else.

26:40.400 --> 26:41.800
You know, with this kind of evidence,

26:41.800 --> 26:43.700
Cynthia could've been caught years ago.

26:44.500 --> 26:47.000
Mom said without that money,
we wouldn't have made it,

26:47.600 --> 26:50.600
And she figured, as long as cynthia
was free, the money would keep coming.

26:51.500 --> 26:54.600
So why did you lie to me about
where you were last tuesday?

27:00.100 --> 27:01.400
Because i was there.

27:01.900 --> 27:04.300
At the hotel. I followed her.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.300
Look, i was just gonna talk to her.

27:06.800 --> 27:09.000
I spent an hour walking up
and down that hallway,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.400
Trying to get up the courage
to go and knock on that door.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.400
You know, i- I was gonna do it.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.200
But then someone got off the elevator

27:16.200 --> 27:18.100
And knocked on her door instead.

27:18.500 --> 27:19.500
You saw her killer?

27:19.500 --> 27:21.100
I didn't get a good look,

27:22.100 --> 27:23.800
But i did hear them talking.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.500
- And i can tell you one thing.
- What?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.300
It was a woman.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.700
Lee wax. Beckett!

27:34.900 --> 27:36.200
It was lee wax!

27:38.000 --> 27:40.900
Beckett? Lee wax!

27:42.000 --> 27:42.800
Lee--

27:49.100 --> 27:51.600
Murder. Are you people crazy?

27:51.600 --> 27:53.400
I have an eyewitness who
can place you at the s.R.O.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.200
Where cynthia's body was found.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.800
You had motive, means andopportunity.

27:57.900 --> 28:01.600
Please. Only a novelist could come
up with a twist this absurd.

28:01.600 --> 28:04.600
Not as absurd as killing a
woman to salvage your story.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.800
Drowning her in motor oil gave
you just the ending you need.

28:08.300 --> 28:11.800
I'm atruecrime writer, so i don't
have your talent for fiction.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.900
We know your publisher wanted
to dump your contract.

28:15.900 --> 28:19.400
Because i told them that
i thought cynthia was lying.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.800
So you didn't believe
her remorse was genuine?

28:21.900 --> 28:24.100
When cynthia cried, it was for herself.

28:24.100 --> 28:27.300
She wanted to cash in and keep
herself out of jail. That's it.

28:27.300 --> 28:29.500
Well, she must've felt some
responsibility for what happened.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.400
After all, she sent the pikes
money year after year.

28:34.700 --> 28:35.700
What money?

28:36.100 --> 28:39.300
Every month since the bombing,
the pikes have been receiving money,

28:39.300 --> 28:41.000
Courtesy of cynthia dern.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.900
Only, there's nothing
about that in your notes.

28:42.900 --> 28:44.200
Because she never told me.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.800
- Are you sure?
- We're sure.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.500
Look, the tuesday that cynthia was killed,

28:48.500 --> 28:51.700
I was out to dinner with my
publisher until after midnight,

28:51.700 --> 28:53.300
So i couldn't have killed her.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
Remind me, if i ever
decide to write a memoir,

28:59.000 --> 29:00.500
To never write a memoir.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.000
Okay.

29:08.600 --> 29:11.700
- Why not?
- Because memoirs are about truth.

29:11.900 --> 29:13.800
And i'm not a very truthful person.

29:13.900 --> 29:15.700
It would be too easy
to make myself look good.

29:16.400 --> 29:19.000
- It might be harder than you think.
- Maybe.

29:19.600 --> 29:22.500
But i would sure start with the
most generous thing i ever did.

29:25.900 --> 29:28.400
You mean, like how you anonymously
sent money to your victims

29:28.400 --> 29:30.600
Because you felt so guilty
about what you'd done?

29:30.600 --> 29:34.300
The object of cynthia's memoir
was to gain sympathy.

29:34.600 --> 29:38.000
What could be more sympathetic than sending
the pikes guilt money for 20 years?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.600
It doesn't make sense that
cynthia didn't tell lee wax.

29:41.400 --> 29:43.400
Unless the money didn't come from cynthia.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.100
It had to be from cynthia.
Swanstrom was in prison,

29:46.100 --> 29:47.500
And susan mailer was dead.

29:47.500 --> 29:50.200
Call. And you're sure
no one else was involved?

29:50.200 --> 29:52.800
No, just the three of 'em,
assuming you believe the fbi.

29:52.800 --> 29:55.500
- Call.
- You know, we don't really have to talk about this.

29:55.500 --> 29:59.500
Anything to stop hizzoner here from
talking bout budget initiatives.

29:59.700 --> 30:01.200
Okay, judge.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.900
Who was it that appointed you again?

30:03.300 --> 30:04.900
Now the fbi believe.

30:04.900 --> 30:08.900
But why take cynthia dern's word for anything
that happened the night of the bombing

30:09.000 --> 30:11.900
When her own ghostwriter
didn't even trust her?

30:11.900 --> 30:13.900
You know, the judge is right.

30:14.700 --> 30:17.200
What do we actually know
about what happened?

30:23.300 --> 30:24.200
Not much.

30:24.700 --> 30:26.400
According to lee wax's notes,

30:26.400 --> 30:28.600
Captain pike heard two women arguing

30:28.600 --> 30:30.800
Just before the explosion,
and cynthia claims

30:30.800 --> 30:33.200
That she was trying to change susan's mind.

30:33.200 --> 30:33.900
Fold.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.300
But if we assume cynthia was lying...

30:35.300 --> 30:38.300
Then maybe it was susan
that wanted to save pike

30:38.300 --> 30:40.400
And cynthia that wanted to run.

30:40.800 --> 30:41.900
Raise $20.

30:41.900 --> 30:44.500
Right. But the bomb was already set,

30:44.500 --> 30:46.600
So the 3-Minute timer is already ticking.

30:46.600 --> 30:49.800
The girls argue, wasting precious seconds...

30:49.800 --> 30:52.500
Susan runs towards the ticking
bomb to try to shut it down...

30:52.500 --> 30:53.900
While cynthia runs for cover.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.400
Right. Susan gets to the
bomb, but too late.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.300
Boom.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.600
Which means susan mailer didn't
die trying to set the bomb.

31:00.600 --> 31:04.300
She died trying to save an
innocent man's life. Fold.

31:04.500 --> 31:06.700
It still doesn't explain
where the money came from.

31:07.500 --> 31:08.500
Fold.

31:08.900 --> 31:11.500
Well, what about it, castle?
You're good with twists.

31:11.500 --> 31:14.100
- Where'd the money come from?
- I'm thinking.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.700
Yeah, well, you might want to
think up some chips for the pot,

31:16.700 --> 31:18.400
'Cause it looks like
it's just you and me.

31:18.400 --> 31:21.000
- Whoa!
- Ooh.

31:22.300 --> 31:23.600
All right, detective beckett...

31:24.800 --> 31:25.900
- I'm all in.
- Ooh.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.500
Oh, what's the matter?
You afraid of a little action?

31:28.500 --> 31:31.500
Oh, do us a favor, detective.
Beat his pants off.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.600
Yes, please, beat my
pants off, if you dare.

31:33.700 --> 31:35.900
Beckett, do me proud.

31:35.900 --> 31:38.300
To hell with proud, make him
cry like a little girl.

31:43.300 --> 31:44.200
All right.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.800
Sorry, fellas, it's just not my night.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.300
Oh, who's a good little boy?

32:06.300 --> 32:07.800
Who's a good little boy?

32:07.800 --> 32:10.700
You are and you are and you are.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.700
Don't you ever get tired of winning, castle?

32:12.700 --> 32:14.000
You'd think so, right? But no.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.400
Well, i think that's it for me.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.100
Detective, it was a pleasure.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.000
- Mr. Mayor.
- Sorry we couldn't solve your case.

32:22.100 --> 32:24.700
And i'm sorry i couldn't make
him cry like a little girl.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.500
Mm. Well, it's not your fault, detective.

32:27.600 --> 32:31.600
No matter how down he gets, he
always manages to rise from the dead.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.100
- Oh, now that'd be a twist.
- What?

32:35.800 --> 32:38.500
The money had to come from cynthia
because swanstrom was in jail

32:39.100 --> 32:41.100
- And susan mailer was dead, right?
- Right.

32:42.300 --> 32:45.200
But what if susan mailer
didn't die in that explosion?

32:46.600 --> 32:48.300
What if she's still alive?

32:52.600 --> 32:55.500
- Susan mailer? Alive?
- Her body was never found.

32:55.500 --> 32:58.300
Yeah, because she was
vaporized in the explosion.

32:58.300 --> 33:00.300
Well, maybe she was thrown clear.

33:00.300 --> 33:02.800
Well, then she would've been badly
burned and would've need care.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.100
And no one matching her description
ever checked into area hospitals.

33:05.100 --> 33:07.100
Mere details, my good man.

33:07.100 --> 33:09.000
Um, around here we call them "facts."

33:09.000 --> 33:11.400
Well, then let's go get us some facts.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.300
Please don't think less of me.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.400
I did what i had to do to survive.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.200
These are from all over the place.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.900
Uh, not the recent ones. The
recent ones are all the same.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.300
Lititz, pennsylvania.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.600
If we're gonna road-Trip,
i'm gonna have to pee first.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.500
- I've never seen her before.
- Are you positive?

33:38.500 --> 33:40.300
- Didn't he sound positive?
- Castle.

33:40.700 --> 33:41.500
Okay.

33:42.500 --> 33:43.500
How about her?

33:45.400 --> 33:47.700
- She'd be older now.
- How much older?

33:47.700 --> 33:48.900
20 years.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.300
I don't think so.

33:53.900 --> 33:56.100
That's what i get for listening
to a mystery writer.

33:56.100 --> 33:59.200
She might have scars or walk with a limp.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.500
Like she's been in an accident?

34:02.100 --> 34:03.400
It could be mary wright.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.200
Mary wright?

34:06.900 --> 34:08.500
She comes in once a month or so.

34:08.500 --> 34:11.199
Buys a money order to send
to her relatives in new york.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.300
Do you have her address?

34:17.199 --> 34:19.900
It sounds naive now, but, um...

34:21.600 --> 34:24.500
Everything i did back then i did because

34:24.500 --> 34:25.800
I thought it would help.

34:26.100 --> 34:28.000
We're not here because of the bombing, susan.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.800
We're here because of what
you did to cynthia dern.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.400
Her body was found in a tub of motor oil.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.500
But you already know that.

34:35.600 --> 34:38.100
Forensics is going
through that room as we speak.

34:38.500 --> 34:40.300
And believe me,
they will find something,

34:40.300 --> 34:43.100
Something that connects you
to cynthia's death.

34:43.100 --> 34:45.500
She should've just left it all alone.

34:46.199 --> 34:47.900
She had a husband and a good life.

34:48.100 --> 34:50.800
But that wasn't cynthia.
Once she decided on something,

34:50.800 --> 34:53.800
- Well, you just better not be in her way.
- Like that night on the tanker?

34:55.100 --> 34:56.600
I saw the captain go below.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.500
I don't know how he got back
onboard without us seeing.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.300
I- I tried...

35:02.700 --> 35:04.100
But i was-- I was too late.

35:04.100 --> 35:07.000
When the bomb exploded,
i was thrown overboard.

35:09.300 --> 35:12.500
I can still feel the heat on my skin...

35:13.900 --> 35:14.900
Even today.

35:15.300 --> 35:17.600
How did you survive
without medical attention?

35:24.400 --> 35:26.100
Um, a friend took me in.

35:26.100 --> 35:28.300
A- A med student nursed me
back to health.

35:29.500 --> 35:32.200
- I got a new identity.
- And mary wright was born.

35:32.200 --> 35:34.500
It's not hard to live like a ghost

35:34.500 --> 35:36.600
When everyone you love thinks you're dead.

35:38.900 --> 35:41.500
I never contacted anyone
from my former life...

35:43.300 --> 35:45.000
Not even my parents.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.400
But you still sent money to the pikes.

35:47.800 --> 35:51.100
They had a son... medical bills.

35:51.100 --> 35:52.500
I- I was responsible.

35:54.800 --> 35:58.100
Everything could've stayed
just the way it was except...

35:58.100 --> 36:00.100
Except cynthia decided to write a book.

36:00.100 --> 36:03.700
That reporter put a post
on an environmental board

36:03.700 --> 36:05.400
Asking for info on cynthia.

36:05.700 --> 36:08.100
I e-Mailed, pretending to be
an old friend of the group.

36:08.100 --> 36:09.600
It didn't take long
for me to figure out

36:09.600 --> 36:11.600
That she had found cynthia
and cynthia was lying

36:11.600 --> 36:13.200
About what happened on the ship.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.800
You tracked her down.
You confronted her.

36:16.900 --> 36:19.500
I threatened to turn myself in
if she went through with the book--

36:20.200 --> 36:23.500
Give myself up, tell
the authorities everything.

36:23.700 --> 36:26.500
She begged to meet with me first--

36:26.800 --> 36:29.600
- Somewhere we could talk.
- That's when you rented the room?

36:29.700 --> 36:32.500
Oh, no, cynthia rented the room, not me.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.800
- It was all part of her plan.
- Her plan?

36:34.800 --> 36:36.200
Her plan to murder me.

36:37.900 --> 36:41.100
W- When i got there, she poured me a drink.

36:41.100 --> 36:44.300
"Let's toast to old friends," she said.

36:44.900 --> 36:47.000
Only, you see, i don't drink.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.700
I tried to leave. She wouldn't let me.

36:51.900 --> 36:53.900
I- I hid in the bathroom.

36:55.100 --> 36:56.400
That's when i saw it...

36:56.700 --> 36:59.300
The tub, full of oil.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.400
Then i understood.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.600
She didn't plan to talk to you.

37:05.600 --> 37:08.600
She planned to kill you
and make it look like suicide.

37:08.800 --> 37:11.500
That wine was laced with a sleeping pill.

37:11.900 --> 37:14.300
You were supposed to drink it
and then drown in the oil.

37:14.600 --> 37:15.800
And then the world
would think that you were

37:15.800 --> 37:18.200
Racked with guilt over
the pikes all these years

37:18.200 --> 37:20.800
And that you finally decided to commit suicide.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.400
Once your body was discovered,
the public would clamor

37:23.400 --> 37:26.100
For the true story-- Cynthia's true story--

37:27.100 --> 37:29.800
With you now cast as the villain.

37:36.700 --> 37:37.900
We struggled.

37:38.800 --> 37:42.000
She lost her balance and
fell against the sink and...

37:42.000 --> 37:43.500
Hit her head.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.100
I should've called for help,

37:50.500 --> 37:52.400
But i just wanted it to be over.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.200
So i...

37:57.500 --> 37:59.400
I dragged her to the tub and...

38:03.900 --> 38:04.800
I...

38:05.500 --> 38:06.800
I pushed her in.

38:09.900 --> 38:11.200
You see, i was already dead.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.200
I just wanted to keep it that way.

38:33.700 --> 38:35.500
I heard you made an arrest.

38:36.100 --> 38:38.600
You can hear all about it
in the morning news.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.800
Oh, come on, after all the help
i gave you on this case,

38:41.800 --> 38:43.800
You can't give me any more
information than that?

38:43.800 --> 38:46.300
Well, i could,
but i just keep thinking

38:46.300 --> 38:49.000
That if it wasn't for you, there
wouldn't be a case in the first place.

38:50.100 --> 38:51.400
What does that mean?

38:51.700 --> 38:54.400
All the people from cynthia's
past that you interviewed--

38:54.800 --> 38:57.400
How did you manage to let
every one of them know

38:57.400 --> 38:59.000
That you were in contact with her?

39:00.500 --> 39:01.600
What are you implying?

39:01.600 --> 39:04.600
You wanted someone to put two and
two together and call the cops.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.800
You wanted cynthia in prison.

39:06.900 --> 39:09.200
That way, you could tear up
the contract you had with her

39:09.500 --> 39:11.200
And write the story you wanted to write

39:11.600 --> 39:14.100
With an ending that would sell more books.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.300
I mean, you couldn't call
the authorities yourself.

39:16.300 --> 39:17.800
What kind of story would that be?

39:19.200 --> 39:22.000
That's a lovely theory,

39:22.300 --> 39:25.700
But even if it's true,
i didn't kill cynthia dern.

39:25.700 --> 39:28.300
I didn't even do anything illegal.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.500
Oh, no, no, no, it's not illegal.

39:32.300 --> 39:34.100
It's just slimy.

39:34.600 --> 39:37.200
So your, uh, all-Access pass

39:38.200 --> 39:39.500
Has been revoked.

39:45.600 --> 39:46.700
Oh, and one more thing--

39:47.600 --> 39:49.800
One day, and one day not far from now,

39:50.700 --> 39:52.400
I'm gonna use this in a book.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.900
Susan mailer's in booking.

40:09.500 --> 40:10.300
Hmm.

40:11.700 --> 40:12.900
All these years,

40:13.200 --> 40:15.300
Trying to do the right thing,
trying to make amends...

40:16.000 --> 40:19.200
Because of cynthia's greed,
she's gonna end up in jail.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.700
If you're looking for a happy ending,

40:20.700 --> 40:22.300
You've come to the wrong place.

40:22.300 --> 40:25.200
Next time, i guess i'll just try
that massage parlor on 2nd avenue.

40:25.700 --> 40:26.400
Just kidding.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.700
Actually, who needs a happy
ending when you have a story

40:28.700 --> 40:31.100
With people pretending to be dead,

40:31.300 --> 40:33.100
Living under assumed names,

40:33.100 --> 40:36.100
Plotting fake suicides
and murder for revenge?

40:36.100 --> 40:38.200
You know, i'm glad to see
that you're entertained.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.000
I, however, have to call michael goldman

40:40.000 --> 40:42.400
And let him know that
his wife was a sociopath.

40:42.400 --> 40:45.100
But you also get to call
jared swanstrom and tell him

40:45.100 --> 40:47.700
That he's no longer responsible
for susan mailer's death.

40:47.700 --> 40:49.500
As a matter of fact,
susan mailer's still alive.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.200
Which is why cynthia is now dead.

40:51.200 --> 40:53.900
Wow, you are all
about the cloud, aren't you?

40:53.900 --> 40:55.200
Never the silver ling.

40:55.300 --> 40:58.100
Okay. Maybe this might
cheer you up a little bit.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.600
- Your winnings.
- My winnings?

41:02.600 --> 41:04.800
Oh, don't play coy with me.
You threw your hand.

41:06.900 --> 41:07.900
All right, i was trying to be nice.

41:07.900 --> 41:10.100
I didn't want to embarrass you
in front of your friends.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.200
Now we're even,

41:11.900 --> 41:14.900
So what do you say to a little showdown?

41:16.400 --> 41:18.900
Head-To-Head. Toe-To-Toe.

41:19.500 --> 41:20.800
Winner take all.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.800
Mano a mujer.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.300
"Hand to woman"?

41:25.400 --> 41:26.600
Whatever it takes.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.200
- You're on.
- No mercy.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.900
- I'm gonna make you hurt.
- Oh, you're gonna gethurt.

41:33.900 --> 41:36.400
- What are we playing for?
- Pride. Or clothing.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.400
I think i got a bag of gummy bears.

41:39.800 --> 41:40.800
Shuffle.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.200
Deal.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.500
Comfy with texas hold'em?

41:47.500 --> 41:49.800
I'm comfy so long as my cards
come from the top of the deck.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.900
Huh. What you got up your sleeves?

41:52.300 --> 41:54.200
Aside from my muscular arms?

41:54.200 --> 42:01.200
