WEBVTT

00:08.177 --> 00:09.843
Are you serious?!

00:09.878 --> 00:11.762
You needed me to help you
figure out the computer

00:11.797 --> 00:13.046
so you could watch porno?!

00:13.098 --> 00:14.714
<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies...

00:14.716 --> 00:16.767
Dad, you got to find
a new place to stay

00:16.802 --> 00:18.051
starting tomorrow!

00:18.103 --> 00:20.187
Hey. Molly.

00:21.693 --> 00:24.274
Whatever is decided here,
I'm sure Roscoe

00:24.309 --> 00:25.696
will land on his feet.

00:25.816 --> 00:27.699
<i>She has a lot of
influence in our school community</i>

00:27.781 --> 00:31.142
<i>and she wants Roscoe expelled.</i>

00:32.752 --> 00:34.953
<i>Somewhere along the
way, you convinced yourself</i>

00:34.988 --> 00:36.404
that you had real power.

00:37.154 --> 00:39.621
And now you're a problem
I have to solve.

00:39.942 --> 00:45.843
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

00:45.963 --> 00:47.863
<i>Do you want to
make a phone call?</i>

00:47.898 --> 00:49.665
Or, you know, look sort of busy?

00:49.667 --> 00:50.632
This isn't looking busy?

00:50.668 --> 00:52.167
Maybe look like you're crunching

00:52.169 --> 00:54.336
some numbers.
God, this feels still so stiff.

00:54.338 --> 00:55.721
It's like a JCPenney catalog.
Maybe type something up?

00:55.756 --> 00:57.005
It's not a JCPenney catalog.

00:57.007 --> 00:58.807
How about this?
Yeah.

01:00.010 --> 01:01.510
What?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.679
Can I...?

01:03.731 --> 01:05.180
Hey, Blue Man Group,
say words. What?

01:05.232 --> 01:06.515
Can I talk to you for a sec?

01:06.567 --> 01:07.849
Open your...

01:07.902 --> 01:08.901
Sorry.
Okay.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.852
It's fine.

01:10.854 --> 01:11.820
Everything's fine.
What?!

01:11.855 --> 01:12.821
So, I thought you should know

01:12.856 --> 01:14.022
that Denna is in the building.

01:14.024 --> 01:15.524
Does she have a gun?

01:15.576 --> 01:17.576
I mean, I don't... think so.

01:17.611 --> 01:20.195
Okay.
Well... Jesus, Mar...

01:23.033 --> 01:25.167
Denna Altshuler

01:25.202 --> 01:26.702
is on her way up.
Oh, my God!

01:26.704 --> 01:28.420
Are you serious?
Yeah.

01:28.455 --> 01:29.621
There's nothing in the fridge,
and my hair is a disaster.

01:29.673 --> 01:30.706
What are we gonna do?

01:30.708 --> 01:32.040
Why am I the only person even

01:32.092 --> 01:33.709
remotely concerned about this?

01:33.761 --> 01:35.794
Marty openly defied a
powerful jillionaire.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.429
You know what they say
about a woman scorned?

01:37.464 --> 01:39.932
That it's a sexist, borderline
misogynistic expression?

01:39.967 --> 01:42.017
Oh, that's right, this
is the-the new, sensitive,

01:42.052 --> 01:44.102
dating-Kelsey Clyde. I forgot.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.938
How about this?
You're a jittery twat.

01:45.973 --> 01:47.556
Does that feel better,
more comfortable?

01:47.558 --> 01:49.524
No, it, I mean, it feels
worse, but at least normal.

01:49.560 --> 01:50.559
You have nothing to worry about.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.977
Marty has it under control.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.111
With the press play
and the corporate

01:53.147 --> 01:54.563
intelligence component,
we are fine.

01:54.565 --> 01:56.148
"Corporate intelligence"?
What are you talking about?

01:56.200 --> 01:57.232
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Marty asked me

01:57.234 --> 01:58.734
to find a forensic accountant

01:58.736 --> 02:00.619
to look into Denna Altshuler's

02:00.654 --> 02:02.037
financial history, all right?
We're gonna meet with him

02:02.072 --> 02:04.573
this morning.
This morning?

02:04.625 --> 02:06.742
Yeah, before the Davis/Dexter
consult, which reminds me.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.077
Where are we with those
pro forma revenue models?

02:09.128 --> 02:10.127
What? I don't know.

02:10.163 --> 02:11.413
You don't know? Okay!

02:11.465 --> 02:12.831
Not a big consult or anything.

02:12.883 --> 02:15.801
Just the third largest
pharma in the country.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.886
I know they're not the ones
that make your roofies,

02:17.921 --> 02:19.755
but I feel like
we should care about it.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.923
What do we know about
this forensic accountant?

02:21.976 --> 02:23.425
I mean, really.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.427
Can we trust an outsider
with something this sensitive?

02:25.479 --> 02:28.063
Doug, you are so far out of your
league on this one, it's insane.

02:28.098 --> 02:30.182
Uh, out of the countless
research tasks

02:30.234 --> 02:32.434
that Marty's given me
over the years,

02:32.486 --> 02:34.236
have I ever disappointed?

02:34.271 --> 02:35.937
Look, we are doing battle
with Denna Altshuler!

02:35.939 --> 02:37.656
We're not trying
to find the best

02:37.691 --> 02:39.107
Thai fusion restaurant
in Santa Fe.

02:39.109 --> 02:42.527
That's a very specific
category in a very small city!

02:42.579 --> 02:44.780
Oh, you think your guy
could find Golden Buddha?

02:44.832 --> 02:46.748
Joe Gideon has gathered
competitive intelligence

02:46.784 --> 02:48.283
for Fortune 500 companies.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.751
Uh,

02:49.787 --> 02:52.454
he's done oppo research
for presidential candidates.

02:52.456 --> 02:53.455
Ooh.
He was in

02:53.457 --> 02:55.924
the CIA for 20 fucking years.

02:55.959 --> 02:57.259
Okay, that's impressive,

02:57.294 --> 02:59.761
but can I interject one word
as a counterargument?

02:59.797 --> 03:03.265
Not if the word is "Harvard."
The word is "Harvard."

03:03.300 --> 03:05.350
You know, the old line firms
are just slaves

03:05.386 --> 03:06.968
to the way
they've always done things,

03:07.021 --> 03:08.470
so afraid to break the rules.

03:08.472 --> 03:10.856
Oh, but you're a different
animal, some sort of maverick?

03:10.891 --> 03:12.641
I'm not
your father's Oldsmobile.

03:12.643 --> 03:13.975
Mm.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.111
God. And in referencing
that ancient commercial, I think

03:16.146 --> 03:18.447
I utterly destroyed the point
I was just trying to make.

03:18.482 --> 03:20.232
That's okay.
I can probably be talked

03:20.284 --> 03:21.783
into giving you a do-over.

03:21.819 --> 03:23.535
You have an eraser on that thing?
Yeah, it's a magic.

03:23.570 --> 03:24.703
Hey.

03:24.738 --> 03:25.987
Denna, this is...

03:26.040 --> 03:27.322
Aimee.

03:27.324 --> 03:29.124
It's good to see you again.
Good to see you, too.

03:29.159 --> 03:30.199
Maybe I could get a couple

03:30.210 --> 03:31.376
shots of you two together?
Of course.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.461
Maybe over by the desk?
Okay.

03:32.496 --> 03:33.829
Yeah.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.547
Don't be fooled by the
smile and the tight sweater.

03:35.582 --> 03:37.215
She's a shark
looking for an angle.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.500
Oh, think that's what

03:38.552 --> 03:40.552
the psychologists refer to
as "projection."

03:40.587 --> 03:41.753
That's funny.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.171
I got interview requests

03:43.173 --> 03:44.806
from <i> Business Week</i>
and the <i> Journal.</i>

03:44.842 --> 03:46.508
Apparently, we're doing a little press blitz?
Yeah.

03:46.510 --> 03:48.677
Well, got to get the word out.
Hmm.

03:48.679 --> 03:50.011
Well, here's what I think.

03:50.013 --> 03:52.013
I think you're looking
to protect your ass.

03:52.015 --> 03:54.232
More you're publicly
associated with the firm,

03:54.268 --> 03:57.352
the more your ouster would hurt
the asset value of K and A.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.187
Well, that would be clever
if I was really worried

03:59.189 --> 04:00.989
about you ousting me.
Hmm.

04:01.024 --> 04:02.858
I mean, losing the
face of the company

04:02.860 --> 04:04.359
at this early
juncture? Eek.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.694
That's great.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.828
How about a fun one?

04:06.864 --> 04:08.029
Come on.
Hmm.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.364
Back to back.
That is fun.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.699
Yeah.
Okay.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.703
I'm not... trying to oust you.

04:14.705 --> 04:17.172
Well, that's great,
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

04:17.207 --> 04:19.464
Hmm.

04:19.584 --> 04:21.701
Denna Altshuler. Hoo boy.
Yeah.

04:21.821 --> 04:23.545
Hoo boy?
Well, that's reassuring.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.214
Well, I may be able
to find something

04:26.266 --> 04:28.266
electronically digging,
but most likely,

04:28.302 --> 04:30.218
I'll end up doing some humint,
as well.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.686
That's human intelligence.

04:31.722 --> 04:33.188
Well, little lingo from

04:33.223 --> 04:34.689
his storied days at the Agency.

04:34.725 --> 04:36.224
You know, that's your outside
voice that you're using, Doug.

04:36.226 --> 04:38.226
Was I talking?
Sorry.

04:38.228 --> 04:40.061
We usually just ignore him.
Well,

04:40.063 --> 04:42.564
Denna does strike me as a
careful type, but if there

04:42.566 --> 04:45.117
are skeletons, I'll find them.
Well, that's why we came to you, Joe.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.935
- Time will tell.
- Jesus.

04:46.970 --> 04:48.937
I'm so sorry.

04:48.972 --> 04:50.622
That's my son's school.
Take it.

04:50.657 --> 04:51.873
Fucking behave in here.

04:51.909 --> 04:53.959
I'm trying.
Yeah?

04:53.994 --> 04:55.794
Doug was it?
Yeah, Doug Guggenheim.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.295
This is interesting.
You might want to...

04:57.331 --> 04:58.663
Sure.
Seriously. Take a look.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.248
Okay. If it's numbers.

05:00.250 --> 05:01.299
This particular guy--
handsome? Crazy handsome?

05:01.335 --> 05:02.884
What do you think?
What are we talking about?

05:02.920 --> 05:04.419
Handsome.
What are we talking about?

05:04.421 --> 05:06.388
He's gorgeous, but
who cares? Looking at

05:06.423 --> 05:07.806
shirtless guys during
a client meeting?

05:07.841 --> 05:09.224
It's not very professional.

05:09.259 --> 05:11.643
I just mention this because
this particular guy, at present,

05:11.678 --> 05:13.395
is fucking a woman
named Sarah Guggenheim.

05:13.430 --> 05:14.455
Pardon me?
I'm so sorry.

05:14.575 --> 05:17.241
And in CIA lingo, "fucking" is code for...?
Help me out, Joe.

05:17.361 --> 05:19.002
I like to do a little
background check on the people

05:19.122 --> 05:21.123
I'm working with--
always keep it to myself--

05:21.243 --> 05:22.736
but in this case, since, uh,

05:22.856 --> 05:24.606
your wife and this guy are
canoodling, I thought...

05:24.608 --> 05:26.274
Soon to be ex-wife, so I could
give a shit who she's dating.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.409
Uh-oh.
What's "Oh oh" mean?

05:27.444 --> 05:29.077
Uh-oh. What's this?
What's "Uh-oh"?

05:29.112 --> 05:30.445
Now I'm looking
at her credit card statement.

05:30.447 --> 05:31.663
Let's read it.
Oh, are you still investigating?

05:31.698 --> 05:32.831
Let's close the case.
Let's read it.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.449
Open that case up.
What does that statement say?

05:34.501 --> 05:35.617
Very recent purchase
of Astroglide.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.786
That's not a problem, is it?
Well...

05:37.838 --> 05:39.588
Just so we're on the same page,

05:39.623 --> 05:40.622
that is a personal lubricant,
right?

05:40.624 --> 05:42.624
Very personal.
Mostly employed for anal sex.

05:42.626 --> 05:43.842
Stop me if I'm wrong.
Do we want to jump there?

05:43.877 --> 05:45.293
No.
Myriad of uses available.

05:45.295 --> 05:46.294
Plenty. So many.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.512
Sarah might be menopausal.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.598
There's one.
Although, 32 years old--

05:49.633 --> 05:52.300
doubtful. I would go
with the anal angle.

05:52.302 --> 05:53.542
Well, it could be a gift, so...

05:53.554 --> 05:54.686
You got to admit
he's thorough, huh?

05:54.721 --> 05:55.571
I think he's invasive.
Nope.

05:55.691 --> 05:56.906
That's an affront.
Thorough.

05:57.026 --> 05:59.107

06:36.680 --> 06:38.680
Hey, Dad.

06:44.771 --> 06:46.321
You okay?
Yeah.

06:46.356 --> 06:48.323
You sure?

06:49.359 --> 06:50.942
Yeah.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.495
Would it be cool
if I just go to class?

06:53.530 --> 06:55.196
Uh, no one expects you to.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.531
Why don't you just

06:56.583 --> 06:58.199
let me take you home, huh?

06:58.201 --> 07:01.703
You can teach me how to play
that new, uh,<i> Death Island</i>

07:01.755 --> 07:02.871
video game?

07:02.923 --> 07:04.172
You gonna head-shrink
some zombies, Pop?

07:04.207 --> 07:05.423
You see, if I can get

07:05.459 --> 07:07.459
to the root of what's causing
these zombies

07:07.511 --> 07:08.843
to crave human brain,

07:08.879 --> 07:10.428
I can cure this whole thing.

07:10.464 --> 07:14.549
Uh, no offense,
but I'd rather just be here,

07:14.601 --> 07:16.184
do my normal thing.

07:16.219 --> 07:17.552
Is that all right, Dad?

07:17.604 --> 07:19.220
Yeah, it's cool.

07:24.561 --> 07:26.561
See you at home.

07:27.898 --> 07:30.065
Burn this fucking place
to the ground, Pop.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.233
Yeah, I'll give you the matches.

07:32.235 --> 07:34.486
In the nine years Teddy
Grammatico has been at the helm,

07:34.538 --> 07:37.155
Davis/Dexter has experienced
unprecedented growth

07:37.207 --> 07:39.240
in both revenue and number
of held patents.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.543
How about we dispense with the
history lesson and get to it?

07:41.578 --> 07:42.711
Of course, Teddy.

07:42.746 --> 07:44.379
Our goal here is simple.

07:44.414 --> 07:45.664
Achieving greater efficiencies

07:45.716 --> 07:48.466
while continuing to find
ways to cure the incurable.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.669
Greater efficiencies
aren't gonna be enough.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.555
Your high-value
R&D strategy is out of sync

07:53.590 --> 07:55.557
with the lower price point
required

07:55.592 --> 07:57.559
for expansion
into emerging markets,

07:57.594 --> 08:00.095
not to mention the potential
bloodbath you're facing

08:00.147 --> 08:02.347
with so many
of your blockbuster patents--

08:02.399 --> 08:06.318
um, Keltroxin,
Vivipro, uh, Fenocor--

08:06.353 --> 08:08.403
they're all set to expire.

08:08.438 --> 08:10.105
Hmm.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.407
We're working on a new cancer
drug we're very excited about.

08:12.442 --> 08:14.776
Well, Clyde's dad has cancer.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.611
What?

08:16.613 --> 08:19.080
This is where the magic happens.

08:19.116 --> 08:21.783
Come on, let me introduce you
to the head of our cancer team.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.786
Hang on.

08:24.788 --> 08:26.121
How is your dad, by the way?

08:26.173 --> 08:28.173
Oh, I don't know,
but I'm fucking fantastic.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.541
You haven't spoken to him?

08:29.593 --> 08:30.959
No, not since I kicked him out.

08:30.961 --> 08:32.677
Oh, my God. Come on, Clyde.
You got to call him.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.846
He could be lying face down
in a gutter somewhere.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.264
You know what?
You're right, Doug.

08:36.299 --> 08:38.133
I'm gonna give him
a call right now.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.384
There you go.

08:39.436 --> 08:40.635
Beep, boop-boop, blip-blip,

08:40.636 --> 08:43.554
blip-blip, buh-blip-blip,
blip-blip.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.557
Voice mail.
Right to voice mail!

08:45.609 --> 08:47.559
Wow. You're going to
hell, you know that?

08:47.611 --> 08:49.694
Not gonna talk to
my dad there, either.

08:51.815 --> 08:53.365
What do you think of my CFO?

08:53.400 --> 08:55.817
Brent? Uh,

08:55.869 --> 08:57.869
he seems...

08:57.904 --> 09:00.038
passionate about the work
you do here, and...

09:00.073 --> 09:01.656
He's a fucking moron.

09:01.658 --> 09:03.158
Okay.

09:03.210 --> 09:07.162
Between you and me,
I'm going to fire him.

09:07.164 --> 09:09.164
That's certainly
your prerogative.

09:09.166 --> 09:10.382
You ever been to Dan Tana?

09:10.417 --> 09:11.633
The restaurant?
Mm-hmm.

09:11.668 --> 09:13.718
A few times.
You like it?

09:13.754 --> 09:15.503
Uh, I don't love their pastas,
but I-I...

09:15.505 --> 09:17.639
- I remember them having
a really good steak. - All right.

09:17.674 --> 09:20.558
Let me know what night works
for you this week. We'll go.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.560
Um... I...

09:22.596 --> 09:24.562
Dinners are not good.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.681
In fact, most of my nights
are booked,

09:26.733 --> 09:28.266
but I could probably do a lunch.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.734
Okay, I see what's
happening here.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.904
What's happening?
You think I'm asking you out.

09:32.939 --> 09:36.191
What does that say
about your self-esteem?

09:36.193 --> 09:38.076
It's either so sky high

09:38.111 --> 09:40.028
that with you about to pop
you think I'm trying

09:40.080 --> 09:41.196
to get in your maternity pants,

09:41.198 --> 09:43.081
or it's so low that your brain

09:43.116 --> 09:45.667
doesn't go
to "maybe he just wants to talk

09:45.702 --> 09:48.703
about that soon-to-be-open
CFO position."

09:50.207 --> 09:52.507
You're offering <i> me</i> the CFO position?
Did I say

09:52.542 --> 09:54.926
I was offering it to you?
I said I wanted to talk

09:54.961 --> 09:56.711
about it.
No, right. I didn't mean to...

09:56.763 --> 09:58.213
Between you and me...

09:58.265 --> 10:00.215
I'm going to offer it

10:00.267 --> 10:02.717
to you.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.103
Huh.
"Huh"?

10:05.138 --> 10:06.387
Word on the street was that

10:06.389 --> 10:07.806
you were looking
for a new position,

10:07.858 --> 10:09.941
but if I misheard...
No, no, no. Yes. I mean...

10:09.976 --> 10:12.610
it's just not what
I expected. That's...

10:12.646 --> 10:15.947
Um... the job
would be huge.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.565
And I am...

10:17.567 --> 10:19.234
huge.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.737
Well, by the time
this all shakes out,

10:22.789 --> 10:24.289
you'll have had your kittens.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.740
Speaking of which,

10:25.742 --> 10:27.125
if you're looking
for a dumb-as-nails manny,

10:27.160 --> 10:28.710
I know a guy who's about to be

10:28.745 --> 10:29.744
out of work.

10:29.746 --> 10:30.879
Hi.

10:30.914 --> 10:32.247
I'll see you tonight.

10:32.249 --> 10:33.882
Dan Tana at 8:00.

10:33.917 --> 10:35.917
I'll be there.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.473
We presume it was a student.

10:41.508 --> 10:43.091
We're currently combing
through the security footage.

10:43.093 --> 10:44.592
I want to see it.

10:44.594 --> 10:46.644
The security footage?
Yeah.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.763
W-Well, obviously,
I'd have to check

10:48.765 --> 10:50.265
with the school's attorneys.
Yeah, obviously.

10:50.267 --> 10:52.901
And no question we
need to find and punish

10:52.936 --> 10:54.402
the responsible parties,
but I don't want

10:54.437 --> 10:56.488
to lose focus
on what's crucial here.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.656
Obviously, we're very concerned
with Roscoe's well-being.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.108
Everything's so fuckin' obvious,

11:00.160 --> 11:02.110
I wonder why we're even
having this conversation.

11:02.112 --> 11:04.279
Specifically, what steps

11:04.331 --> 11:07.448
are being taken to make sure
that Roscoe feels safe

11:07.501 --> 11:09.918
and that this
doesn't happen again.

11:09.953 --> 11:12.420
We're already coordinating
with the Gay-Straight Alliance

11:12.455 --> 11:15.123
for a school-wide forum
to promote tolerance, kindness

11:15.175 --> 11:17.959
and respect.
We're also bringing in a team of counselors

11:17.961 --> 11:19.511
for group sessions
and one-on-ones.

11:19.546 --> 11:22.463
Mr. Kaan, your reputation
as a psychologist

11:22.465 --> 11:23.464
precedes you.

11:23.466 --> 11:24.799
We would love your participation

11:24.801 --> 11:26.718
and insight.
Wow. Well, while you're down there,

11:26.770 --> 11:28.186
don't forget to work the balls.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.304
Marty...
No, Pop,

11:29.306 --> 11:31.105
I'm hearing a lot of
boilerplate bullshit,

11:31.141 --> 11:33.474
but what I'm not hearing
is an apology.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.527
I couldn't be sorrier

11:35.562 --> 11:37.478
that this happened at my school.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.564
It didn't just happen
at your school, John--

11:39.616 --> 11:40.782
you <i> let</i> it happen.

11:40.817 --> 11:42.057
You practically <i>made</i> it happen.

11:42.103 --> 11:43.729
All right, Marty, I know
you're upset but he...

11:43.849 --> 11:44.739
No, Pop, no,

11:44.859 --> 11:46.997
I got to tell you, man, your
handling of the whole purse affair,

11:47.117 --> 11:48.489
real study in leadership.

11:48.491 --> 11:51.459
Basically, because
some big donor said "boo,"

11:51.494 --> 11:52.827
Roscoe became a pariah.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.380
Then it was just open season
on my son,

11:55.415 --> 11:58.049
with everyone feeling free
to spew whatever hateful shit

11:58.084 --> 12:01.169
was inside of them.
I've... already spoken to Kathy Nichols.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.388
In light of what's happened,
everyone is willing

12:03.423 --> 12:05.557
to take a long beat
on the expulsion talk.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.842
Oh. Well, that's very
generous of you.

12:07.844 --> 12:10.678
Marty... I'm as horrified
as you are about this.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.314
Obviously.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.519
Hey, it's me again, Dad.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.738
Call me back.
I'm starting to get worried.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.323
I'm proud of you.

12:22.359 --> 12:24.359
Oh, my God.
Fuckin' shoot me.

12:24.361 --> 12:26.494
Hey, um...
when you have a minute,

12:26.529 --> 12:29.247
there's something that I
would like to discuss with you.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.032
Good thing?
Bad thing?

12:31.084 --> 12:32.533
Good thing.

12:32.586 --> 12:35.203
Okay. After the staff meeting?
Great.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.592
Dad.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.710
What...

12:42.712 --> 12:45.046
Look, I know I'm not
allowed to be here.

12:45.048 --> 12:47.048
I just wanted you to see that

12:47.050 --> 12:48.182
I'm still alive.

12:48.218 --> 12:50.218
I'll show myself out.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.722
Come on, go after him.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.608
That's what I'm doing, Doug.
Okay, good, good.

12:56.643 --> 12:57.892
Hey, Dad, wait one second.

12:57.894 --> 13:01.229
I was hoping that
we could talk, all right?

13:01.231 --> 13:03.031
Yeah. Okay.
Can we do it someplace

13:03.066 --> 13:06.567
where that numbnuts
isn't hanging around us?

13:06.569 --> 13:08.786
I insist. Yes, please.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.738
Okay. How you doing?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.073
How's it going?

13:12.125 --> 13:14.409
Okay, uh, that's good.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.794
On to new business.
What do you got for us, Grant?

13:16.830 --> 13:18.630
Something very cool,
actually. Uh...

13:18.665 --> 13:20.081
I don't want
to spook the client.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.299
If their name's
in the article...

13:21.334 --> 13:22.634
No, no. I get it.
This part

13:22.669 --> 13:23.885
can be off the record, right?

13:23.920 --> 13:25.803
Unless the new business
is an underage sex ring,

13:25.839 --> 13:27.305
then I might feel some
moral obligation.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.090
You really have
character, don't you?

13:29.142 --> 13:30.224
My
conference call was cancelled.

13:30.260 --> 13:32.093
Figured I'd pop in for a sec?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.645
That's fine.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.263
Everybody, you know Denna.

13:35.265 --> 13:37.231
You're actually right on time--
Grant was

13:37.267 --> 13:39.267
just about to share some
exciting news with us. Grant.

13:39.269 --> 13:40.485
Okay. So,

13:40.520 --> 13:43.938
I am this close
to reeling in Home Depot.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.273
Holy shit.

13:45.275 --> 13:46.574
Home fucking Depot?

13:46.609 --> 13:48.776
That would be an amazing pull,

13:48.828 --> 13:50.495
but there's
a conflict of interest.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.779
Marty signed

13:51.781 --> 13:52.864
Ace Hardware last month.

13:52.916 --> 13:53.948
They're actually
our biggest client.

13:53.950 --> 13:55.950
Yeah.
What's Home Depot's market cap?

13:55.952 --> 13:57.618
Uh, $130 billion.

13:57.671 --> 13:58.953
And what's Ace
Hardware's, Marty?

13:59.005 --> 14:00.955
$990 million.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.124
Your call.

14:04.294 --> 14:06.010
Guess we have
a new biggest client.

14:07.297 --> 14:09.130
See ya, Ace Hardware.
Great job, Grant.

14:09.132 --> 14:11.182
Thanks.
Uh, Rachel.

14:11.217 --> 14:13.267
Well, my team just got back
from Ann Arbor, and...

14:13.303 --> 14:15.019
Con-way Freight wants
a full top-down.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.971
But now I'm hearing you have

14:16.973 --> 14:18.973
R+L Carriers?
Oh, in the wake

14:18.975 --> 14:21.809
of a merger, sometimes lines
of communication get crossed.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.194
What's R+L's market cap

14:23.229 --> 14:24.645
relative to Con-way's?

14:24.681 --> 14:26.481
It's less.

14:26.516 --> 14:27.281
Oh.

14:27.317 --> 14:28.649
Shit, I was excited

14:28.702 --> 14:30.201
about roping in Russell Stover,
but, Christ,

14:30.236 --> 14:31.986
I feel like a loser
even mentioning it.

14:31.988 --> 14:34.539
Wouldn't you know it,
Goetze's Candy is

14:34.574 --> 14:36.124
also one of my clients.

14:36.159 --> 14:37.992
And to answer
your next question,

14:37.994 --> 14:40.495
they do have a smaller market cap.
Goetze's.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.331
I used to really love
their caramel creams.

14:43.333 --> 14:45.967
But we can't proceed
on sentimentality,

14:46.002 --> 14:49.303
can we?
No, no, we cannot.

14:49.339 --> 14:51.339
Anybody else?

14:51.341 --> 14:53.508
I've had a lot
of cappuccinos in my life.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.560
This one-- excellent.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.075
Of course, paying
eight dollars for it

14:57.097 --> 14:59.647
is kind of like getting a dick
up your ass, but still.

14:59.682 --> 15:01.265
Wow. Well, I'm paying
for it, so...

15:01.317 --> 15:02.517
Well, you can afford it.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.901
You're making good money,
my friend.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.853
Why do I feel there's
an insult buried

15:05.905 --> 15:08.022
deep inside there?
Because you are sensitive.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.524
And maybe also because

15:09.576 --> 15:11.325
I happen to be
a little bit judgmental,

15:11.361 --> 15:12.693
especially where your work
is concerned.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.029
So just a little bit, or...?
All right, a lot.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.864
Yeah.
I guess I was always more

15:16.916 --> 15:18.366
the risk taker type, you know?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.001
Some panned out, some didn't.

15:20.036 --> 15:22.870
The thing is, I see you working in
that job for six or seven years,

15:22.872 --> 15:25.373
and, all right, I know
it's a steady paycheck--

15:25.425 --> 15:27.708
great-- but, uh...
I mean, don't get me wrong,

15:27.761 --> 15:29.710
with a father
in and out of the picture,

15:29.763 --> 15:31.045
it doesn't take Sigmund Freud

15:31.097 --> 15:33.431
to unravel it.
The desire for stability

15:33.466 --> 15:35.466
obviously is related
to some kind of an instability

15:35.468 --> 15:37.802
while you were growing up, right?
Well, you know,

15:37.854 --> 15:39.937
it wasn't that unstable--
I actually had a pretty good childhood.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.189
Thank God for your mother.

15:41.224 --> 15:42.690
Yes.
And let me tell you,

15:42.725 --> 15:43.891
she was something to look at,

15:43.943 --> 15:46.027
for real.
Beautiful eyes.

15:46.062 --> 15:48.062
And that <i> tuchas!</i> My God.
I took her for granted.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.818
I fucked a lot of other women
on the outside...

15:49.938 --> 15:50.898
Hey, Dad, you know what?

15:50.950 --> 15:53.117
I'd rather not dig
back into this shit.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.069
Think maybe we can
concentrate on the present?

15:55.121 --> 15:56.571
Sure.
Good.

15:57.991 --> 16:02.376
I was thinking, I never actually
had an Italian cappuccino.

16:02.412 --> 16:04.962
I mean, cappuccino
in Italy, you know?

16:04.998 --> 16:06.914
Listen... I understand
this might be crazy,

16:06.916 --> 16:09.467
and maybe this is taking
too big of a step,

16:09.502 --> 16:11.752
but what do you think--
the two of us

16:11.754 --> 16:14.755
go away together for a trip
this summer, father and son.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.424
Rome, Florence,

16:16.426 --> 16:17.642
Venice, the works.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.644
I don't mean to sound morbid,

16:19.679 --> 16:21.978
but isn't planning a trip
for the summer kind of...

16:22.098 --> 16:24.265
Shit, I don't know
what's wrong with me?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.400
I forgot to tell you--
well, it was all that time

16:26.436 --> 16:27.685
we weren't talking
and everything.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.770
Listen to this--
I'm cancer-free.

16:29.823 --> 16:32.024
You're cancer... how are you cancer-free?
Well, you know

16:32.025 --> 16:33.441
that I was seeing
that herbalist, right?

16:33.443 --> 16:35.076
No, you never talked
about an herbalist.

16:35.111 --> 16:37.078
Yeah, I was seeing this herbalist.
It was during

16:37.113 --> 16:39.580
all this hoodoo voodoo.
He was rubbing these pastes,

16:39.616 --> 16:41.616
this disgusting tea that
I had to drink-- I'm thinking,

16:41.618 --> 16:44.001
what the fuck am I doing here,
right? And then one day,

16:44.037 --> 16:46.838
he's fooling around, he's pushing
on things, he takes one step back

16:46.873 --> 16:49.290
and he looks me straight
in the eye and he says,

16:49.342 --> 16:51.959
"Sir, the cancer is gone."

16:52.011 --> 16:53.961
Of course, I went
to an actual oncologist

16:54.013 --> 16:56.881
just to check it out.
Yeah, what was that oncologist's name?

16:56.933 --> 16:58.766
Uh, I-I can't remember
his name.

16:58.801 --> 17:00.434
You can't remember
the oncologist's name?

17:00.470 --> 17:03.354
I saw the guy once-- I can't remember.
What hospital?

17:03.389 --> 17:04.722
What fucking difference
does it make?

17:04.773 --> 17:06.691
It's the one... you know,
the one that's over

17:06.726 --> 17:08.006
by the... by the Beverly Center.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.310
Cedars. Okay. That was easy.
And the herbalist?

17:10.313 --> 17:12.646
Alphonse. Can we quit it
with the third fucking degree?

17:12.648 --> 17:14.648
The point is, I'm healthy, okay?

17:14.651 --> 17:15.757
So can we celebrate?

17:15.877 --> 17:18.367
You know, out of... all
the fucking asshole shit

17:18.488 --> 17:20.488
that you've done, lying
that you're at death's door?

17:20.490 --> 17:22.156
Are you...

17:22.157 --> 17:24.157
Oh, my fucking God, Dad.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.409
Where is this coming from?

17:25.461 --> 17:27.461
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Have you gone wacko?

17:27.497 --> 17:29.080
You're right, you're right.
Let's call Alphonse.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.165
Huh? Or Cedars. Or how about
the doctors back home?

17:31.217 --> 17:33.334
Which one of those?

17:33.336 --> 17:35.052
I needed a jump start.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.888
Oh, my fucking God, Dad.

17:36.923 --> 17:39.056
I knew that you weren't
gonna accept me with open arms

17:39.092 --> 17:40.758
unless I had some...

17:40.810 --> 17:43.177
When you get to be my age,

17:43.229 --> 17:45.146
you'll...

17:45.181 --> 17:47.682
Clyde, what I wanted was...

17:47.684 --> 17:49.233
What was it that you wanted?

17:49.269 --> 17:52.153
Huh? To get close to me?

17:52.188 --> 17:54.438
Because all you ever did
when you were here

17:54.490 --> 17:57.241
was sit in my apartment
and act like a fucking asshole.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.827
Except for, of course,
when you came to my work

17:59.862 --> 18:01.362
and acted like an asshole.

18:01.364 --> 18:03.030
I get it, I get it now, Dad,
why you're

18:03.082 --> 18:04.415
going on and on
about the Holocaust-- because

18:04.450 --> 18:06.516
only viewed against Himmler
and Goebbels can you be seen

18:06.636 --> 18:08.337
as anything less
than a fucking shitbag.

18:08.457 --> 18:09.940
With your rationalizations,

18:10.060 --> 18:11.893
and your lies
and your pretentious shit,

18:11.895 --> 18:13.394
the meerschaum pipe,
the fuckin' pipe,

18:13.396 --> 18:14.729
and your rabbinic solemnity,

18:14.781 --> 18:16.781
perfectly calibrated
to make every utterance

18:16.816 --> 18:19.067
sound like wisdom,
but you have no wisdom.

18:19.785 --> 18:21.756
Every piece of advice
you've given is bullshit,

18:21.876 --> 18:24.824
because you have never succeeded
anything in your fucking life.

18:25.241 --> 18:27.961
What are those recipes
that panned out, dad?

18:28.081 --> 18:30.744
Because I can't think of one.

18:30.796 --> 18:32.262
You are a complete...

18:32.382 --> 18:34.415
failure in every single way.

18:34.467 --> 18:36.834
What a waste of a fuckin' life.

18:38.671 --> 18:40.360
I don't feel so good.
Good.

18:41.545 --> 18:44.145
I'm serious, I'm getting this, like,
twinging feeling in my chest.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.568
Oh, my God, are we doing
heart attacks now?

18:46.688 --> 18:48.696
- Just go get me a glass of water.
- Fuck you, you know what.

18:48.816 --> 18:49.462
Stand up!

18:49.582 --> 18:51.480
I'm gonna call you a cab
to the airport,

18:51.516 --> 18:52.877
and you get out of
my fuckin' life!

18:57.606 --> 18:58.905
Dad. Dad.

19:00.000 --> 19:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:15.039 --> 19:16.839
Good day for Associates.

19:16.874 --> 19:19.174
Not such a good day for Kaan.

19:19.210 --> 19:21.540
Ah.
Hmm.

19:21.789 --> 19:24.263
And they just happened to land
those particular companies

19:24.383 --> 19:25.563
on their own?

19:25.683 --> 19:27.522
Money open some doors.

19:29.929 --> 19:31.638
So what is the play, Denna?

19:31.758 --> 19:33.320
Make me feel so miserable

19:33.440 --> 19:35.493
that, what, I just walk away?
No.

19:35.613 --> 19:37.526
I don't want you to go.

19:37.561 --> 19:39.811
Well, actually,
I can't let you go. Right?

19:39.863 --> 19:41.146
You're the face of the company.
I'm the face of the company.

19:41.198 --> 19:43.031
That's what you told me.

19:43.067 --> 19:44.533
Yeah. But
with no real

19:44.568 --> 19:47.152
client base, ergo no power.
Mm.

19:47.154 --> 19:49.788
Just a figurehead.
Well, that's up to you, right?

19:49.823 --> 19:52.024
I'm sure you can hustle up some new clients.
You'll just

19:52.042 --> 19:54.159
come up with bigger ones
to squeeze me out.

19:54.161 --> 19:56.328
To evil.

19:56.330 --> 19:57.963
You always need a villain.

19:57.998 --> 20:00.499
Yeah. So I guess here's the part
where I thank you

20:00.501 --> 20:01.883
for giving me what I needed.

20:01.919 --> 20:03.835
Hey, I wasn't the villain here.
You made me one.

20:03.837 --> 20:06.555
Oh. Well, then I guess
I get to feel better

20:06.590 --> 20:09.543
about <i> my</i> villainy by comparison.
Is that how this whole thing works?

20:09.663 --> 20:11.393
You know what, you're not
even here if not for me.

20:11.428 --> 20:12.511
And how did you say thank you?

20:12.563 --> 20:14.146
You spit
on my turnaround artist,

20:14.181 --> 20:15.514
you spit
on one of my biggest clients,

20:15.566 --> 20:16.848
you spit on me.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.684
Denna...
Hey, you ruined this thing, not me.

20:18.686 --> 20:22.020
You think I give anyone
as much rope as I gave you?

20:22.022 --> 20:24.606
Yeah, that's how I became
a billionaire.

20:24.658 --> 20:27.609
But I gave it to you.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.528
'Cause I'm a goddamn idiot.

20:29.580 --> 20:32.030
Okay.

20:32.032 --> 20:33.532
Well, I'll call off the dogs

20:33.584 --> 20:35.784
if I feel like I can trust you.

20:35.836 --> 20:38.787
You need to prove to me
that I can trust you.

20:38.839 --> 20:40.205
Oh. So all
I have

20:40.257 --> 20:42.040
to do to get things back
on the right track

20:42.042 --> 20:43.425
is start being
your little bitch.

20:43.460 --> 20:45.377
That's not what I said.
It's what you meant.

20:45.379 --> 20:46.878
Okay then,
let's play word games.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.547
We can play word games all day
if you want.

20:48.549 --> 20:51.383
But you are already
my little bitch.

20:51.385 --> 20:53.135
Uh-huh.

20:59.476 --> 21:02.894
Hey, hey. You're back. How'd
things go with your dad?

21:02.946 --> 21:04.896
He died.

21:04.948 --> 21:07.733
You're joking.

21:08.736 --> 21:10.068
You're not joking.

21:10.070 --> 21:13.238
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry, Clyde. I...

21:16.376 --> 21:20.462
Well, hey,
at least on the upside,

21:20.497 --> 21:23.248
Uh, no,
that's actually what killed him.

21:23.300 --> 21:24.833
I went loose on him,

21:24.885 --> 21:27.085
and... he had a
heart attack.

21:27.087 --> 21:30.005
Uh-huh... I think I know
where this is headed.

21:30.057 --> 21:32.474
Because I pushed you
into talking with him,

21:32.509 --> 21:34.142
somehow is is on me.

21:34.178 --> 21:41.098
Uh-uh. No.
I-I just said to have a chat.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.100
Oh, God, I'm so sorry

21:43.102 --> 21:45.436
for your loss. I...

21:47.239 --> 21:50.991
So he kills his father,
and I'm the bad guy.

21:51.027 --> 21:52.993
Okay.

21:54.997 --> 21:57.831
Hey, Joe, listen, goddamn it.
Just fucking get it done.

21:57.867 --> 21:59.500
I don't give a fuck
how much it costs.

21:59.535 --> 22:01.535
Make it the fuck happen.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.838
That was Joe Gideon.

22:04.874 --> 22:07.458
Want to know what he's
dug up so far on Denna?

22:07.460 --> 22:09.927
That she tradedon*** insidn

22:09.962 --> 22:11.545
to short the Gage Motors stock.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.465
We, this isn't over.

22:14.517 --> 22:16.467
She fucking knew, Jeannie.
She knew.

22:16.519 --> 22:17.801
You try to get rid of me,

22:17.803 --> 22:19.520
I'm coming back at your ass
with holy hell.

22:19.555 --> 22:21.972
But you cut off my arms
my legs, take away everything

22:22.024 --> 22:25.309
that makes me
fucking formidable, poof,

22:25.311 --> 22:26.860
threat's gone.

22:26.896 --> 22:29.063
It's insidious.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.814
It's insidious, and it is

22:30.866 --> 22:32.149
so fucking smart.

22:32.201 --> 22:34.318
But guess what, I'm
smart, too, bitch.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.653
Fuck.
So, Jeannie, I need you

22:36.655 --> 22:39.656
to shake the trees 'cause we're
gonna go DEFCON 1 on...

22:41.327 --> 22:43.660
Okay. Well, if you need me to
lob in a call, just let me know.

22:43.662 --> 22:46.830
You're responsible for
my offer from Davis/Dexter,

22:46.882 --> 22:48.382
aren't you?
Um,

22:48.417 --> 22:50.084
I've known Teddy Grammatico

22:50.136 --> 22:52.868
for a long time.
Okay, well, fuck that shit.

22:52.988 --> 22:55.839
- Jeanni... - I hope you and Teddy had
a really nice laugh about it.

22:55.841 --> 22:58.425
It wasn't like that, all right?
He was chewing my ear off

22:58.477 --> 23:00.427
about his CFO, and I put
your name up for it.

23:00.479 --> 23:02.346
Teddy's not a pushover or
an idiot. Hey, he doesn't

23:02.398 --> 23:04.181
just hand over a position
to someone he doesn't want.

23:04.183 --> 23:05.544
Well, I'm not taking
the job, so...

23:05.568 --> 23:07.684
Okay. Well, I know you
and Marty have mended fences,

23:07.686 --> 23:09.186
and that's obviously
complicating for you.

23:09.238 --> 23:11.188
This has nothing to do
with Marty.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.960
Listen, 'cause I actually know
a few things.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.191
Even when you're very bright

23:14.193 --> 23:15.776
and very ambitious,
jobs like this

23:15.828 --> 23:17.694
don't come along often
for women.

23:17.696 --> 23:20.697
Oh. I should call
the folks at NOW, let 'em know

23:20.699 --> 23:22.399
someone's got their Woman of
the Year Award all wrapped up.

23:22.434 --> 23:24.585
I've already been
their Woman of the Year.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.587
Actually, they call it
the Woman of Courage Award,

23:26.622 --> 23:28.205
but it's pretty much
the same thing.

23:29.925 --> 23:32.543
This wasn't some act
of sisterhood.

23:32.545 --> 23:34.044
It wasn't.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.213
But if I'm you,
I don't let that stop me

23:36.265 --> 23:38.465
from taking the
job of a lifetime.

23:38.517 --> 23:40.384
Idiot.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.440
Night, Dad.

23:46.475 --> 23:47.558
Night.
Night, Grandpa.

23:47.610 --> 23:49.560
Night, son.

23:49.612 --> 23:52.112
Roscoe, you know
if you want to talk...

23:52.148 --> 23:56.733
Yours is the room at
the end of the hall.

23:56.735 --> 23:59.903
You know you're a smartass.

24:05.044 --> 24:07.411
You know,
he's not processing this.

24:07.413 --> 24:11.298
No, he's hiding behind
that teenage bravado.

24:11.333 --> 24:13.634
It doesn't have to be tonight,
but he's gonna have to face it.

24:13.669 --> 24:15.502
I don't know, Pop. I mean,

24:15.554 --> 24:17.054
some asshole fucked with him,

24:17.089 --> 24:19.640
and he's not letting it
get him down.

24:19.675 --> 24:21.592
I don't think that's something
that needs to be fixed.

24:21.594 --> 24:23.010
I mean, it sounds like strength.

24:27.349 --> 24:29.316
Motherfu...

24:30.269 --> 24:31.268
Hello?
Sorry.

24:31.270 --> 24:32.853
I-I just spilled coffee.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.404
It's Joe Gideon. I'm downstairs.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.490
Yeah, I'll buzz you up.

24:36.525 --> 24:39.826
How much do you know
about Thomas Altshuler?

24:39.862 --> 24:42.829
Um... Have a seat.
Denna's father?

24:42.865 --> 24:45.165
Big time D.C. lawyer.

24:45.201 --> 24:49.286
Not to mention a go-to advisor
for several presidents.

24:49.338 --> 24:52.923
Unlike most shitbags
in Washington,

24:52.958 --> 24:54.925
Thomas' reputation

24:54.960 --> 24:57.344
was built on
probity and honesty.

24:57.379 --> 24:59.070
A few years ago,

24:59.190 --> 25:02.883
this 80-year-old heavyweight,
he steps in dog shit.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.685
How big?

25:04.720 --> 25:09.389
A steamy, ginormous pile of it.

25:09.441 --> 25:12.392
Middle Eastern international
banking concern, very shady,

25:12.444 --> 25:13.977
paid Tom a hefty fee

25:14.029 --> 25:18.315
to help keep their illegal
takeover of an American bank

25:18.367 --> 25:21.285
hush-hush.
Oh, boy.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.203
The D.A. wanted
to pounce.

25:23.239 --> 25:25.539
Denna summoned every square inch
of her power

25:25.574 --> 25:28.492
to stave off an indictment,
keep his name out of the press.

25:28.494 --> 25:30.994
Well, the girl loves her daddy.
Mm.

25:31.046 --> 25:33.914
Fuck her shit up
if this came out, huh?

25:33.966 --> 25:35.916
No kidding.

25:35.968 --> 25:39.219
I would not want to be the one
to unleash that monster.

25:39.255 --> 25:40.754
Which I see

25:40.806 --> 25:42.089
you're now considering.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.757
You just have to wave it
in her face

25:43.809 --> 25:44.925
to get everything you want.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.010
Oh, Marty wants a lot

25:47.012 --> 25:48.178
of things, Joe.

25:48.230 --> 25:49.680
So you're a crazy person.

25:49.682 --> 25:51.181
Cool.

25:51.233 --> 25:52.516
Well, if it comes up,

25:52.568 --> 25:54.735
you got all that information
from the tooth fairy.

25:54.770 --> 25:56.603
Well, I really want
to thank you for this.

25:56.655 --> 25:59.356
No, no. Tooth fairy.

26:00.693 --> 26:02.693
Tooth fairy.

26:10.836 --> 26:14.037
Hey, Aimee,
it's Marty Kaan. I...

26:14.089 --> 26:16.540
Yeah, I know what time it is.
It's late. I got a watch.

26:16.592 --> 26:19.209
Listen, I found something
that you might find interesting.

26:19.261 --> 26:21.878
Uh, you remember that intrigue
a few years back

26:21.930 --> 26:23.880
with Gulf Financial?

26:23.932 --> 26:26.216
Yeah, well, it turns out
that Azhar Halabi

26:26.268 --> 26:28.635
was in bed
with Thomas Altshuler.

26:29.772 --> 26:33.323
Yep. And guess
who suppressed that shit.

26:37.196 --> 26:40.447
Yeah. I-I'll send you
everything I have.

26:40.482 --> 26:41.448
Uh...

26:41.483 --> 26:44.234
Aimee, I got... I got to go.

26:52.244 --> 26:53.994
Roscoe.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.412
Hmm?

26:55.414 --> 26:57.631
Get in here.

26:59.585 --> 27:00.884
What's up?

27:00.919 --> 27:04.221
So, the school, uh, sent over
the surveillance footage

27:04.256 --> 27:06.757
from last night.

27:06.759 --> 27:08.258
There was footage?

27:08.293 --> 27:09.926
Yeah, look.

27:09.928 --> 27:11.762
Take a look.

27:11.814 --> 27:13.597
Maybe you'll
recognize who it is.

27:16.769 --> 27:19.186
I mean, he's got a hoodie on,
same brand that you wear.

27:19.238 --> 27:20.604
What-What's that brand?

27:20.656 --> 27:21.938
Zero.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.407
Yeah, Zero.

27:23.442 --> 27:26.410
A lot of kids have 'em.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.445
You know who <i>that</i> kid is?

27:34.119 --> 27:36.002
No.
