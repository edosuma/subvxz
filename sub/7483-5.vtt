14:22.061 --> 14:24.128
(woman speaking Spanish)

14:32.972 --> 14:34.205
I'm done for the night.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.306
We just want to talk.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.541
About what?

14:36.543 --> 14:39.177
Looking for a big man.
Curly hair, glasses.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.879
His name is Milton Mulrooney.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.413
Haven't seen him.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.082
You need to talk to my boss.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.217
Your boss is the one
that told us to talk to you.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.253
You got the wrong girl.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.024
We know he's been here.

14:55.361 --> 14:56.928
Is he in trouble?

14:56.930 --> 14:58.396
No, he's in danger.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.231
But we're here
to help him, Carmen.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.334
He's hiding outside of TJ.
(tires screech)

15:03.336 --> 15:05.670
In the desert.

15:11.010 --> 15:13.411
Six heavily armed men
coming across the street.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.280
Six guys at the office.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.582
Guess we're not the only ones
looking for Milton.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.651
Get your stuff. Come on.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.930
Smile and keep walking.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.336
Carmen!

15:38.338 --> 15:40.238
Just keep walking.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.172
Hey!

15:41.174 --> 15:42.273
Hey. Stop!

15:42.275 --> 15:43.975
We're walking out of here.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.978
Easy.

15:55.254 --> 15:57.288
(crowd screaming)

16:06.031 --> 16:08.199
Too many!
We got to lose them!

16:08.201 --> 16:11.502
Sam! Hold her.
I'll get the car.

16:18.610 --> 16:20.044
Sam!

16:20.046 --> 16:21.312
Move!

16:28.253 --> 16:30.588
<i>Darnos el taxi.</i>

16:30.590 --> 16:32.490
<i>Darle.</i>
Get out! Get out!

16:34.026 --> 16:35.093
Open it up!

16:35.095 --> 16:37.228
Come on! Come on!

16:37.230 --> 16:38.262
Take that.

16:38.264 --> 16:39.330
(tires screeching)

17:19.538 --> 17:21.806
(speaks Spanish)

17:22.341 --> 17:23.741
This where Milton is?

17:23.743 --> 17:25.643
Yeah.

17:29.481 --> 17:32.350
You saw who was after us.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.619
You know
we're here to help.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.464
♪ ♪

17:50.836 --> 17:54.405
CALLEN:
Milton Mulrooney?

17:54.407 --> 17:55.773
Oh, no.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.242
We're NCIS agents.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.545
We're taking you back
to the United States.

18:02.281 --> 18:03.548
Do you have I.D.?

18:03.550 --> 18:06.384
No.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.753
Then why did you
bring them here?!

18:08.755 --> 18:10.088
They forced me!

18:10.090 --> 18:11.222
Pedicure's over. Let's go.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.423
You'll have to kill me first.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.592
We're not here
to kill anyone.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.595
Okay? Would you tell them
what happened in town?!

18:17.597 --> 18:18.796
There are men
looking for you.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.331
They shot at us.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.100
And we barely got away.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.235
that killed everyone
at your office.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.603
He's been through enough!

18:25.605 --> 18:27.238
Can't you just leave him alone?

18:27.240 --> 18:28.473
This doesn't concern you.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.741
I am his fiancée.
We are to be married.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.377
That's usually what
"fiancée" means.

18:33.379 --> 18:34.879
What concerns
my husband concerns me.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.280
Hey.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.149
He's not your husband.
No.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.750
He is my soul mate.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.252
CARMEN: He's going
to take my sisters

18:41.254 --> 18:42.487
and my grandmother and mother

18:42.489 --> 18:44.122
back to the United States,

18:44.124 --> 18:45.823
give us citizenship.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.592
Great.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.461
Put your shoes on, let's go
all live the American dream.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.597
You've clearly
never been married.

18:52.599 --> 18:53.798
No, I haven't.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.366
And apparently neither have you.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.568
Now I need to borrow a phone.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.837
You've never been married?

18:59.839 --> 19:01.606
Must be lonely.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.207
(quiet laugh)

19:03.209 --> 19:05.243
I saw him first.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.444
He saved my life.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.412
And that's a bond that
can never be broken.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.214
She's got a point.

19:10.216 --> 19:13.518
I need a cell phone.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.253
You think I'm stupid?

19:15.255 --> 19:17.321
You guys are navy cops.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.624
You don't have I.D.
or a cell phone?

19:19.626 --> 19:21.459
I promise you
we're government agents.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.793
I don't doubt that.

19:22.795 --> 19:27.198
Because it's the government
that's trying to kill me.

19:29.902 --> 19:32.236
We're getting out of here.

19:32.238 --> 19:33.437
What's the code?

19:33.439 --> 19:34.539
Put the phone down!

19:34.541 --> 19:35.940
Easy!

19:35.942 --> 19:37.942
Mama, I think they're
telling the truth.

19:37.944 --> 19:38.943
Juanita?

19:38.945 --> 19:41.245
Take their guns and the phone.

19:48.754 --> 19:50.821
Big gun.

19:58.797 --> 20:00.731
Security cameras show
the bad guys

20:00.733 --> 20:03.367
dump the getaway cars here
at 1:20.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.402
They're pros.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.504
They move fast.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.472
Guess they burned the inside
of the car to destroy

20:08.474 --> 20:09.740
any physical evidence.

20:09.742 --> 20:10.875
Eric, I just sent you a VIN.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.310
You run it for me?

20:14.213 --> 20:16.747
They burnt the trunk, too.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.216
Eric says cars
are stolen.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.818
Got some, uh, clothing.

20:22.621 --> 20:25.356
Maybe a Halloween mask.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.225
Oh!

20:27.227 --> 20:29.961
I got servers.

20:29.963 --> 20:32.263
What?! They would
not burn those.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.664
Well, they did.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.333
Ooh.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.735
Which means they downloaded

20:37.737 --> 20:40.838
the classified
information first.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.007
Cars were burnt five minutes
after the shooting.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.309
I mean, not to mention
you need a power source.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.911
These are servers,
not laptops.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.747
So, maybe they didn't
need the information.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.515
Maybe they just...

20:51.517 --> 20:53.851
needed it to be gone.

20:53.853 --> 20:57.455
So, destroy information about
a covert government operation.

20:57.457 --> 21:00.258
Well, that and then you kill
everybody that knows about it.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.592
Hmm.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.294
You are tickling
my conspiracy bone.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.795
Oh, I didn't even know
you had a conspiracy bone.

21:04.797 --> 21:05.963
But I'm glad I tickled it.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.032
So, whatever was on
these drives was

21:08.034 --> 21:10.034
obviously bad enough

21:10.036 --> 21:12.536
that somebody went
to all this trouble.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.872
And someone
at the Department of Defense

21:14.874 --> 21:17.475
knows what that is.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.310
CALLEN:
Look.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.279
Let's all calm down.

21:22.547 --> 21:23.814
WOMAN:
Legend is, Grandma

21:23.816 --> 21:25.916
killed her second husband
with that pan.

21:25.918 --> 21:28.386
Hey, we're the good guys.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.655
Oh, I like your voice.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.923
It's smooth like honey.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.759
Mama!
It's a nice voice.

21:34.761 --> 21:37.028
CARMEN:
Milton?

21:37.030 --> 21:38.429
I believe them.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.563
I'm sorry.

21:39.565 --> 21:41.599
I just can't trust
anyone right now.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.868
Why do you think
the government's after you?

21:43.870 --> 21:46.570
Either we're here to kill you,
so we already know the answer.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.939
Or you're here to protect me
and you really don't know.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.776
Either way, it doesn't hurt
to tell us what's going on.

21:53.545 --> 21:54.945
Okay.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.315
One of my co-workers,
Margaret...

21:57.317 --> 21:58.616
Who is this Margaret?

21:58.618 --> 21:59.984
She's just somebody
I work with.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.352
This is the first time
I heard of her.

22:01.354 --> 22:02.653
Is she pretty?

22:02.655 --> 22:04.088
Aminta, please...

22:04.090 --> 22:05.756
I have the right
to know the truth.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.391
Baby, you know
I love you...

22:07.393 --> 22:08.392
Margaret's
dead, okay?

22:09.895 --> 22:12.763
Anyway, Margaret and I
discovered monies

22:12.765 --> 22:15.433
that were allocated to
a series of black operations

22:15.435 --> 22:19.070
conducted by a Delta unit
codenamed "Duster."

22:19.072 --> 22:20.071
Okay.

22:20.073 --> 22:22.039
The monies
were allocated

22:22.041 --> 22:24.408
to operations
that never existed

22:24.410 --> 22:26.877
and were never sanctioned

22:26.879 --> 22:30.414
So you think a Delta unit
robbed the government?

22:30.416 --> 22:32.583
Of over $40 million.

22:32.585 --> 22:35.519
Yesterday, we reported
it to our superior.

22:35.521 --> 22:36.520
Doug Ouellet?

22:36.522 --> 22:37.988
Yeah.
And here's the thing.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.924
Everybody knows Margaret and me

22:39.926 --> 22:42.760
always bring our lunch,
we don't go out.

22:42.762 --> 22:45.029
So you think the Delta unit
hit the office?

22:45.031 --> 22:46.464
You tell me.
Who else could it be?

22:46.466 --> 22:48.032
And you think
this Ouellet is involved?

22:48.034 --> 22:50.634
It could be him or
anybody he spoke to

22:50.636 --> 22:52.470
up the chain of
command in DoD.

22:52.472 --> 22:56.107
Milton, if there's
a Delta unit hunting you,

22:56.109 --> 22:59.543
you need to let us get you
back to the States now.

23:00.545 --> 23:02.880
(car approaching)

23:05.150 --> 23:07.852
It's the same men from the bar.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.487
Give me the phone.
Now!
The gun.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.756
The code is 7007.

23:16.094 --> 23:19.029
UNIT LEADER:
That's a walkie-talkie!
Pick it up!

23:19.031 --> 23:20.498
Should I get it?

23:20.500 --> 23:21.499
Go.

23:21.501 --> 23:22.099
They'll
kill her.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.701
No.

23:23.703 --> 23:24.769
They want to talk.

23:31.176 --> 23:32.877
SAM:
No service.

23:32.879 --> 23:35.079
Come on. Ain't someone else
got another phone?

23:35.081 --> 23:36.046
The phones work here.

23:36.048 --> 23:37.581
Try mine.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.419
LEADER (over walkie-talkie):
Who am I speaking with?

23:43.722 --> 23:45.923
I'd like to ask you
the same thing.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.959
Let's begin this way.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.895
We just destroyed
the cell tower.

23:50.897 --> 23:53.097
It'll be days
before it's repaired.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.566
This is going to be
just about us.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.501
So...

23:57.503 --> 23:59.203
if you want to see
another sunrise,

23:59.205 --> 24:00.471
we dictate the terms.

24:00.473 --> 24:02.873
(walkie-talkie beeps)

24:14.686 --> 24:16.987
I couldn't get anything off the
platters from the burnt servers.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.690
But there was an off-site backup
where the files were stored.

24:19.692 --> 24:21.926
I'm sorry, why
destroy the servers

24:21.928 --> 24:23.561
if the information
was already backed up?

24:23.563 --> 24:24.895
Because it destroyed
the record

24:24.897 --> 24:26.697
of who authored
the documents.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.132
So we searched
the backup

24:28.134 --> 24:30.901
and we found one
small anomaly.

24:32.671 --> 24:33.938
Two budgets.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.539
Same name,
same dates...

24:35.541 --> 24:37.107
Both had an
allocation of monies

24:37.109 --> 24:38.809
to a Delta Unit,
Duster,

24:38.811 --> 24:40.845
but there was one
small difference.

24:40.847 --> 24:44.081
the Delta unit listed
under the oversight

24:44.083 --> 24:46.016
of different
House subcommittees.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.685
Neither of which
had security clearances

24:47.687 --> 24:48.886
for the other's
operations.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.955
And since they're
all black ops...

24:50.957 --> 24:54.925
Neither committee knew
where the money was going.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.160
Were they hiding
an unsanctioned op?

24:56.162 --> 24:57.161
NELL:
No.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.829
We think Delta Unit Duster

24:58.831 --> 25:01.632
received money for operations
that never occurred.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.834
Great. So, then, just
good, old-fashioned fraud.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.203
And someone
in the accounting office

25:06.205 --> 25:07.972
found out.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.106
KENSI:
So what you're
saying is that

25:09.108 --> 25:11.742
a Delta unit killed
all those people

25:11.744 --> 25:13.611
and then destroyed the servers
to cover it up?

25:13.613 --> 25:15.179
That's exactly
what we're saying.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.681
So you're accusing some
of the most honorable men

25:17.683 --> 25:19.950
in our military
of murder and fraud.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.051
Okay.

25:21.053 --> 25:23.754
How much money are
we talking about?

25:23.756 --> 25:25.089
$41 million.

25:25.091 --> 25:26.156
That's enough

25:26.158 --> 25:28.759
to test your honor.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.594
Ouellet had to
know about this.

25:30.596 --> 25:32.029
Which is why he
forgot his lunch.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.031
Go pick him up.
Now.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.733
Yeah.

25:35.735 --> 25:38.769
Get me the name
of the army general

25:38.771 --> 25:40.838
in charge of Delta Unit Duster.

25:40.840 --> 25:41.839
Quickly.

25:41.841 --> 25:44.008
On it.

25:44.010 --> 25:46.944
So, to be very, very clear...

25:46.946 --> 25:48.879
we want Milton Mulrooney.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.015
We get him, we walk away.

25:51.017 --> 25:53.951
And for the rest of you,
life goes on.

25:55.987 --> 25:57.821
That's not
gonna happen.

25:57.823 --> 25:59.557
You don't send him out,

25:59.559 --> 26:01.959
I guarantee you every person
in that house dies today.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.061
At what cost to you?

26:04.063 --> 26:06.096
We're going to take
some of you with us.

26:07.265 --> 26:09.199
I saw you using six-shooters.

26:09.201 --> 26:12.703
Keep looking outside the window.

26:19.811 --> 26:21.011
Now the situation is clear.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.948
You send out Milton Mulrooney,

26:23.950 --> 26:25.282
or we're coming in to get him.

26:27.819 --> 26:30.621
There's no doubt the monies
were allocated to your unit.

26:30.623 --> 26:33.958
I was made aware of these
allegations 36 hours ago.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.894
All I'm willing
to tell you right now is,

26:36.896 --> 26:38.629
I stand behind my men.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.097
They're the best of the best.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.700
Save the recruiting speech,
General.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.635
I need access
to your Delta unit.

26:44.637 --> 26:47.771
These men operate
with very little oversight.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.707
We don't give them missions;

26:49.709 --> 26:51.108
we give them objectives.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.110
Well, if they want
to clear their name,

26:53.112 --> 26:55.379
you can give them the objective
of speaking to me.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.015
I don't even know where
they are at this moment.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.284
That sounds like obstructing
an investigation.

27:04.055 --> 27:06.123
I'll try to get them
to talk to you,

27:06.125 --> 27:07.191
but I can't promise anything.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.193
These men determine
their own fate.

27:09.195 --> 27:12.763
Unless I determine it.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.898
Sooner or later, it will happen.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.767
They're out of the country.

27:16.769 --> 27:17.768
Where?

27:17.770 --> 27:19.837
Where?

27:21.106 --> 27:24.008
The last communication
I had from them was Tijuana.

27:25.677 --> 27:27.144
All right, I'll meet them
face-to-face.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.780
You make that happen, General.

27:31.016 --> 27:32.282
NELL:
Sir...

27:32.284 --> 27:34.051
the Delta unit's in Tijuana.

27:34.053 --> 27:35.886
Sam and Callen are in Tijuana.

27:35.888 --> 27:37.254
I'm aware of that.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.989
Okay, so, what
do we do, wait?

27:38.991 --> 27:41.058
Hell, no.

27:42.060 --> 27:43.794
Arrange for a chopper
immediately.

27:43.796 --> 27:45.195
Get me to Mexico.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.164
How dare you do this to me

27:47.166 --> 27:48.298
after what I've been through?

27:48.300 --> 27:51.068
It's a slick trick.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.137
Two budgets.
Left hand doesn't know

27:53.139 --> 27:54.738
what the right
hand is doing.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.140
Using the big
bureaucracy

27:56.142 --> 27:59.109
to rip off the government
of $41 million.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.344
I have nothing to do with that.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.679
Ouellet,
sit down.

28:04.082 --> 28:05.315
NELL (over earwigs):
Guys, we found the smoking gun.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.851
Doug Ouellet has
a Swiss bank account

28:07.853 --> 28:09.253
with nearly $3
million in it.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.188
Money came in
as income

28:11.190 --> 28:13.390
from a weapons broker
based out of El Paso, Texas,

28:13.392 --> 28:15.059
called Millennial Arms.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.094
NELL:
Probably used the company
to launder the money

28:17.096 --> 28:18.796
and get it out of the country.

28:18.798 --> 28:21.231
So, we know about the Swiss
bank account and $3 million.

28:21.233 --> 28:24.401
And the arms company in Texas
you used to launder it.

28:24.403 --> 28:26.437
I don't know what
you're talking about.

28:26.439 --> 28:27.838
I want to speak to...

28:27.840 --> 28:29.139
Please, don't say the "L" word.

28:29.141 --> 28:32.242
You just can't
say "lactate"

28:32.244 --> 28:33.243
or "lactation."

28:33.245 --> 28:34.311
But you could say "lollipop."

28:34.313 --> 28:35.913
I was kind of thinking "lawyer."

28:35.915 --> 28:37.281
DEEKS:
Oh...

28:37.283 --> 28:40.150
I mean, you can
play it that way, but...

28:40.152 --> 28:43.220
You were first one in the door
and that does hold a prize.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.722
Tell him what he's won, Deeks.

28:44.724 --> 28:46.223
Well, you've won
a fantastic vacation

28:46.225 --> 28:48.726
to the Alcatraz of the Rockies.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.094
That's right,
the federal prison

28:50.096 --> 28:52.396
in beautiful
Florence, Colorado.

28:52.398 --> 28:55.165
Your account has
$3 million in it.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.934
Your partners have
the other $38.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.502
DEEKS:
So what's it gonna
be, Doug? Huh?

28:58.504 --> 29:00.003
Door number one,
where you spend

29:00.005 --> 29:01.305
the rest of your
life behind bars?

29:01.307 --> 29:03.240
Or door number two...

29:03.242 --> 29:05.275
and you're out in time
to be a grandpa?

29:05.277 --> 29:07.010
KENSI:
Be smart.

29:07.012 --> 29:08.879
You didn't pull the trigger.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.814
Do you really hold loyalty
to these guys?

29:10.816 --> 29:14.218
Oh, and Doug, these, uh,
supplies are limited.

29:14.220 --> 29:17.221
So this offer
isn't gonna last forever.

29:17.223 --> 29:19.990
ERIC:
Uh-oh.

29:19.992 --> 29:22.226
What... what do you mean,
"Uh-oh?"

29:22.228 --> 29:24.361
NELL:
Guys... flag on the play.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.530
The I.D. used
to open the account

29:26.532 --> 29:29.366
has Doug Ouellet's name
but not his photo.

29:29.368 --> 29:32.035
You've got to be kidding me.

29:32.037 --> 29:33.504
What is it?

29:33.506 --> 29:34.872
Mmm...

29:34.874 --> 29:38.041
why would I have passed the
information about the fraud

29:38.043 --> 29:40.911
up to the congressional
investigators and the DoD?

29:40.913 --> 29:42.880
(sighs)

29:42.882 --> 29:45.015
What are we missing?

29:46.284 --> 29:48.118
That's where I found it, right
on the floor, right there.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.321
Be Milton and, uh,
crouch down on the toilet.

29:51.323 --> 29:52.389
Got it.

29:54.826 --> 29:55.826
Yikes.

29:55.828 --> 29:57.828
Okay.
Hold this,

29:57.830 --> 29:59.196
and hold it so that a bullet
could go through it

29:59.198 --> 30:00.330
but not hit you.

30:00.332 --> 30:01.398
Uh...

30:04.135 --> 30:06.403
No, I mean, this doesn't line up
to any of the hits.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.405
That means it wasn't shot here.

30:10.074 --> 30:11.341
But this sure makes it look like

30:11.343 --> 30:12.976
somebody was trying
to shoot him.

30:16.314 --> 30:18.448
But they weren't.

30:20.286 --> 30:24.221
They were trying
to kill Ouellet.

30:24.223 --> 30:25.522
And they tried to get to him

30:25.524 --> 30:27.191
before he got up
the chain of command.

30:27.193 --> 30:30.227
Except...

30:30.229 --> 30:32.362
Ouellet forgot his lunch.

30:36.901 --> 30:39.336
They're moving
into position.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.104
You guys have any fuel
around the house?

30:41.106 --> 30:42.840
Gasoline, kerosene,
anything like that?

30:42.842 --> 30:44.341
Yeah, I think there's
some in the storage room.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.442
Show me.

30:51.916 --> 30:54.251
The walls are
thicker in here.

30:54.253 --> 30:55.352
It's to keep the storage cool.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.354
You'd be safe in here.

31:03.962 --> 31:05.362
Can you use this?

31:05.364 --> 31:07.531
Not me, I got a gun.

31:07.533 --> 31:08.532
You use it.

31:08.534 --> 31:09.633
Me?

31:09.635 --> 31:11.335
I saw how you handled yourself

31:11.337 --> 31:12.336
with that shotgun.

31:12.338 --> 31:13.303
You can do it.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.439
Stop it.

31:15.441 --> 31:17.307
You might be sexy,
but you're loco.

31:17.309 --> 31:18.375
Who do you think I am, Zorro?

31:18.377 --> 31:20.544
I got the gasoline.
All right.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.079
Now find some glass
bottles and rags.

31:22.081 --> 31:23.247
Quickly.
Come on, come on.

31:27.218 --> 31:28.619
All right, I'm gonna need
you and one of your sisters

31:28.621 --> 31:30.187
to cover this side of the house.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.656
There are six of them,
machine guns.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.224
And just two of you.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.360
Plus Milton, your sisters
and your mom.

31:36.362 --> 31:37.928
That makes eight of us.
It's a fair fight.

31:39.330 --> 31:42.366
My family owned
a restaurant in Tijuana.

31:42.368 --> 31:45.002
The cartel forced us
to pay for protection money

31:45.004 --> 31:46.670
until we went out of business.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.672
It killed
my father.

31:50.508 --> 31:52.676
The restaurant
was all we had.

31:54.379 --> 31:55.445
What are you saying?

31:55.447 --> 31:57.381
You just want
to give up?

31:59.350 --> 32:02.386
In Mexico,
there are predators...

32:02.388 --> 32:04.187
and prey.

32:05.290 --> 32:07.224
Then let me show you
how to hunt.

32:10.395 --> 32:12.529
I want to show you something.

32:21.072 --> 32:23.140
We could offer it
in exchange for our lives.

32:23.142 --> 32:26.109
We could offer them
a million dollars,

32:26.111 --> 32:27.444
they're not gonna let us
walk out of here.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.679
Is this yours?

32:28.681 --> 32:30.347
No. Milton.

32:30.349 --> 32:32.149
Milton?

32:32.151 --> 32:36.186
What's a government accountant
doing with cash like that?

32:36.188 --> 32:37.654
That's getaway money.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.423
You had to

32:39.425 --> 32:41.525
show 'em
the money.

32:41.527 --> 32:42.693
SAM:
So you're
the man inside,

32:42.695 --> 32:44.528
diverting cash
for these guys.

32:44.530 --> 32:47.397
Give the walkie-talkie
to Carmen.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.267
I will blow your head off.

32:52.570 --> 32:54.571
Bring it
to me!

32:57.642 --> 32:59.643
I'm coming out.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.144
Good.

33:08.119 --> 33:09.586
He stole this money?

33:09.588 --> 33:12.189
He stole a lot
more than that.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.424
He also got a lot
of people killed.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.526
(clamoring)

33:17.328 --> 33:18.528
SAM:
Hey, stop, stop, stop!

33:18.530 --> 33:20.530
<i>Nada, alto, alto!</i>

33:20.532 --> 33:21.698
<i>Basta!</i>

33:21.700 --> 33:23.500
He lied, he promised
us everything!

33:23.502 --> 33:24.768
He was using us.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.536
Right now we have bigger
problems to deal with.

33:26.538 --> 33:28.538
Sure do, you're all dead.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.707
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.776
An hour from now, they're
gonna be burning your bodies

33:32.778 --> 33:34.644
in a pile...

33:34.646 --> 33:36.279
SAM:
Hey, hey! <i> Basta!</i>

33:36.281 --> 33:37.714
Where are you?

33:48.726 --> 33:51.628
There's nobody
that can hear you.

33:51.630 --> 33:54.498
You have 15 minutes
to send him out,

33:54.500 --> 33:56.633
or everybody dies.

33:58.236 --> 33:59.536
<i>¿Qué ahora?</i>

33:59.538 --> 34:00.604
<i>¿Qué hacemos?</i>

34:11.783 --> 34:14.785
These five men crossed
into Mexico six hours ago.

34:14.787 --> 34:19.056
They're fast and, judging from
the bags they're carrying...

34:19.058 --> 34:22.259
This footage puts
the Delta unit in Tijuana

34:22.261 --> 34:23.827
when General Keys said
they were there.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.695
ERIC:
Now, to the best
of our knowledge,

34:25.697 --> 34:27.364
these are the men in the unit.

34:27.366 --> 34:29.666
Army Rangers, Green Berets--

34:29.668 --> 34:34.337
Covert Operations in Iran,
Afghanistan, Iraq, Russia.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.173
Ultimately,
Delta units are

34:36.175 --> 34:37.674
highly trained
military assassins.

34:37.676 --> 34:41.645
I've often heard Delta
mockingly refer

34:41.647 --> 34:45.449
to Navy SEALs as lifeguards.

34:45.451 --> 34:48.118
Not many people
can get away with that.

34:48.120 --> 34:51.288
These aren't the men
you want hunting you.

34:51.290 --> 34:54.091
You call me as soon
as you hear from Granger.

34:54.093 --> 34:55.425
Yeah.

34:59.564 --> 35:01.731
UNIT LEADER:
Time's up.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.867
Last chance.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.869
We know Milton's
working with you.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.704
You start firing
those SAWs in here,

35:07.706 --> 35:09.606
there's a good chance
you're gonna kill him.

35:11.576 --> 35:14.111
That just means
a better split for us.

35:14.113 --> 35:16.746
No, you need him.

35:16.748 --> 35:19.749
He probably set up the accounts
you transferred that money into.

35:19.751 --> 35:24.421
That is gonna suck to have all
that money and no access to it.

35:24.423 --> 35:26.423
The stories
that we tell ourselves

35:26.425 --> 35:28.425
to make it all seem okay.

35:28.427 --> 35:30.827
Why go through
with all this, then, huh?

35:30.829 --> 35:34.431
I don't see you
and Milton as BFFs.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.433
You need him alive.

35:36.435 --> 35:38.768
I'll see you in hell, stranger.

40:28.693 --> 40:31.194
Part of an arms-dealing team

40:31.196 --> 40:34.197
that was laundering money
for Milton Mulrooney.

say was in here?

41:54.513 --> 41:55.545
I didn't.

41:55.547 --> 41:56.946
I just said "a lot."

41:56.948 --> 41:59.215
"A lot" is all relative,
Assistant Director.

41:59.217 --> 42:01.284
Does $8,000 seem
like a lot to you?

42:01.286 --> 42:03.286
On our salary?
Hell, yeah.

42:03.288 --> 42:06.556
Now, you fellas wouldn't have
left some cash behind

42:06.558 --> 42:07.891
with those ladies, would you?

42:07.893 --> 42:10.693
that the Treasury's just going
to destroy anyway?

42:10.695 --> 42:14.264
Yeah, it's not like they helped
save our lives or anything.

42:14.266 --> 42:16.733
What was in that bag
is in that bag.

42:16.735 --> 42:18.735
That's your story?

42:19.270 --> 42:20.937
That's our story.

Mine, too, gentlemen. Mine, too.
