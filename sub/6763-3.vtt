WEBVTT

01:40.058 --> 01:40.850
Andrea... An...
Andrea, Andrea.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.520
This is getting
a little out of hand.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.188
Sorry, Brandon,
I can't help you.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.272
I'm busy right now, all right?

01:46.356 --> 01:48.233
Guys, come on.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.901
We're having fun.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.486
Well, I'm glad someone is.

01:54.280 --> 02:01.162
(no audio)

02:05.667 --> 02:09.753
(no audio)

02:16.094 --> 02:18.304
{\an3}Well, which one
do you want?

02:29.274 --> 02:30.984
Anybody seen Brandon Walsh?

02:31.067 --> 02:31.943
{\an1}Hey, hey, hey,
guys, guys.

02:32.026 --> 02:33.903
Don't tell Henry I'm here.
Don't tell him.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.572
(laughing)

02:35.655 --> 02:36.364
{\an3}Lying down on the job
again, huh, Walsh?

02:36.447 --> 02:38.366
Get back to work,
you lazy bum.

02:38.449 --> 02:42.203
Come on you guys, time
for lunch. Let's go!

02:42.287 --> 02:44.038
Manga, manga,
run, run, run.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.081
Hey.

02:45.164 --> 02:46.541
Hey.

02:46.624 --> 02:47.542
Hey!

02:47.625 --> 02:50.086
Hey, Andrea.

02:50.169 --> 02:51.087
Thanks, Brandon.

02:51.170 --> 02:52.088
That's all right.

02:52.171 --> 02:53.548
{\an1}You got a good group
of kids there.

02:53.631 --> 02:54.465
{\an1}Hey, listen, I don't
know if you have

02:54.549 --> 02:56.259
{\an1}any plans for tonight,
Jay! uh, you know...

02:56.342 --> 02:58.428
{\an3}I'm sorry. Excuse
me. I gotta go.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.096
I'll see you
later, Okay.

03:03.933 --> 03:04.934
Is that Andrea's
new boyfriend?

03:05.018 --> 03:05.351
{\an1}I don't know.
He's a boy.

03:05.435 --> 03:06.311
He's her friend.

03:06.394 --> 03:08.479
{\an3}Well, she certainly
looks happy.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.273
I hadn't noticed.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.108
{\an1}Well, I'll see
you later, Brandon.

03:12.191 --> 03:13.568
{\an1}Gotta go beat your
father at gin rummy.

03:13.651 --> 03:14.736
{\an3}Have fun.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.112
{\an1}Brandon, have you
seen today's <i> Times?</i>

03:16.195 --> 03:17.155
No.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.531
{\an3}Dylan's old man
made the front page.

03:18.615 --> 03:19.699
He's up for parole.

03:23.786 --> 03:26.080
{\an1}Well, to tell you the truth,
I think Dylan's better off

03:26.164 --> 03:26.539
with his old man
behind bars.

03:40.011 --> 03:40.929
Dylan.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.306
I'm glad you could come.

03:43.389 --> 03:44.307
You look great.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.558
I feel great.

03:45.642 --> 03:46.476
{\an3}Been waiting
for this all year.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.770
Glad you made it.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.313
{\an3}Me, too,

03:50.396 --> 03:51.981
but it's not over yet.

03:52.065 --> 03:52.482
I've still
got that hearing.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.776
{\an1}I mean...

03:54.859 --> 03:55.526
you've, you've been a
model prisoner, right?

03:55.610 --> 03:57.362
They're gonna let you out.

03:57.445 --> 03:58.988
{\an3}There are a lot of
people out there

03:59.072 --> 04:01.783
{\an3}who would love to see your
old man behind bars forever,

04:01.866 --> 04:02.533
and that's why
it's real important

04:02.617 --> 04:04.327
for me to cover
all my bases.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.537
{\an3}My lawyers say that I
could use a little help

04:06.621 --> 04:09.874
in the, uh, in the
image department.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.417
That's where
you come in.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.547
What do you want me to do?

04:16.630 --> 04:17.798
It's very simple.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.341
All you have to do
is write a letter.

04:19.425 --> 04:23.346
What am I supposed
to say in this letter?

04:23.429 --> 04:24.347
{\an3}Well, what
do you think

04:24.430 --> 04:26.307
you're supposed to
say in this letter?

04:26.391 --> 04:27.350
You're my son.

04:27.433 --> 04:28.559
I'm your father.

04:28.643 --> 04:29.852
You figure it out.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.604
You never change, Jack.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.023
What're you telling me?

04:34.107 --> 04:36.526
{\an3}Are you telling me you're
not gonna help me out here?

04:36.609 --> 04:38.903
If you were in my shoes,
I'd be there for you,

04:38.987 --> 04:40.321
and you know that's true.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.408
So, can I count on you here?

04:43.491 --> 04:46.953
I'll see what I can do.

04:47.578 --> 04:50.415
Good, good.

04:50.498 --> 04:51.833
Then that's settled.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.711
Look, uh...

04:54.794 --> 04:56.504
{\an3}you know the address
of my lawyer.

04:56.587 --> 04:57.213
Do me a favor, make sure

04:57.296 --> 04:58.715
they get a draft
of that letter

04:58.798 --> 04:59.924
by the end of the week,

05:00.008 --> 05:01.551
{\an3}so they can put
it in the record.

05:02.510 --> 05:03.428
Yeah.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.221
Thanks.

05:05.304 --> 05:06.639
Don't mention it.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.851
So... uh...

05:09.934 --> 05:11.394
how's that girlfriend
of yours doing?

05:11.477 --> 05:12.562
What's her name, uh... Linda?

05:12.645 --> 05:14.564
Brenda.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.441
Her name is Brenda.

05:22.655 --> 05:26.409
{\an5}BRENDA:
<i>I cannot believe that</i>
<i>we are actually in Paris.</i>

05:26.492 --> 05:28.077
{\an4}DONNA:
<i>Brenda, what time</i>
<i>is it back home?</i>

05:28.161 --> 05:29.328
<i>No way, Donna.</i>

05:29.412 --> 05:31.080
{\an1}<i>We are not calling</i>
<i>home right now.</i>

05:31.164 --> 05:32.415
<i>We just got here.</i>

05:32.498 --> 05:33.416
Please do not lecture
me right now, Brenda.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.418
I am so tired, my
stomach is a wreck

05:35.501 --> 05:36.627
and I have a sore throat

05:36.711 --> 05:37.462
{\an1}from all those people
smoking in the airplane.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.589
{\an1}Well, just think
about this.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.258
{\an1}You won't have to get on
another plane for six weeks.

05:42.341 --> 05:43.217
Good, because seriously,

05:43.301 --> 05:45.428
{\an1}if I had to smell another
cigarette right now,

05:45.511 --> 05:46.346
I'd absolutely hurl.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.933
{\an1}Oh, uh...

05:51.017 --> 05:52.477
{\an1}Ugh!

05:52.560 --> 05:53.561
Oh, uh,<i> monsieur.</i>

05:53.644 --> 05:58.566
{\an1}Uh,<i> est-il possible</i>
<i>que vous nu fumez pas,</i>

05:58.649 --> 06:00.777
{\an1}<i>por favor?</i>

06:00.860 --> 06:04.238
{\an1}I-I mean,
<i>s'il vous plaît?</i>

06:04.322 --> 06:08.451
{\an1}Tell him that smoking
causes lung cancer.

06:08.534 --> 06:09.619
And heart disease.

06:09.702 --> 06:10.870
And emphysema. Tell him.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.622
Donna, my French
is not that good.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.755
<i>La fumee-vous derange?</i>

06:20.838 --> 06:22.965
Well, you see,

06:23.049 --> 06:23.716
{\an1}the plane was
really smoky...

06:23.800 --> 06:25.593
<i>Pas de probleme.</i>

06:25.676 --> 06:27.929
<i>La porte est la.</i>

06:29.597 --> 06:32.141
The door is <i> there!</i>

06:32.225 --> 06:32.767
What did he say?

06:35.686 --> 06:38.523
(angry muttering)

06:38.606 --> 06:40.274
What are you doing?

06:40.358 --> 06:45.029
<i>Je fume, je fume,</i> okay?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.280
Out! You, out!

06:46.364 --> 06:47.532
<i>La tour est finit.</i>

06:47.615 --> 06:48.783
<i>C'est tout.</i>

06:48.866 --> 06:50.159
{\an1}Brenda!

06:50.243 --> 06:50.868
{\an1}Donna, don't worry,
I'll handle this.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.454
{\an1}Look, I'm sorry.
You can smoke

06:53.538 --> 06:54.580
if you want.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.124
{\an1}I mean, it's a free
country, right?

06:59.752 --> 07:01.712
{\an1}It's <i> your</i> country,
<i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

07:01.796 --> 07:03.798
{\an1}Hmm.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.552
{\an1}Oh!

07:07.635 --> 07:09.720
Have a nice day!

07:13.224 --> 07:15.143
{\an1}Thanks for
handling that, Bren.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.686
Any time, Don.

07:21.732 --> 07:24.193
Oh... we made it!

07:25.653 --> 07:27.113
I wanna go home!

07:27.196 --> 07:29.657
{\an1}Donna, I did not
just carry your luggage

07:29.740 --> 07:32.076
{\an1}five blocks up a hill
just to have you wimp out.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.037
Once we get in the room,
everything will be fine.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.915
<i>Cela sera fini quand,</i>
<i>aujourd'hui ou demain?</i>

07:37.999 --> 07:38.749
{\an1}<i>Un mauvais ...</i>
<i>et de mauvais utils!</i>

07:38.833 --> 07:40.751
<i>Allez-vous,</i>
<i>et depechez.</i>

07:40.835 --> 07:41.752
<i>Je suis furieux.</i>

07:41.836 --> 07:43.671
<i>Immediatement.</i>

07:43.754 --> 07:46.883
<i>Oh, mademoiselles.</i>

07:46.966 --> 07:49.051
{\an1}<i>Bonjour. Je m'appelle</i>
<i>Brenda Walsh, et...</i>

07:49.135 --> 07:50.052
{\an1}<i>Mais oui!</i>

07:50.136 --> 07:51.053
<i>Et Mademoiselle Martin?</i>

07:51.137 --> 07:53.264
<i>Bonjour, bonjour.</i>

07:53.347 --> 07:54.724
<i>Je suis la concierge,</i>

07:54.807 --> 07:55.683
{\an1}<i>Madame DuBois.</i>
<i>Mais vous etes en retard.</i>

07:55.766 --> 07:57.727
{\an4}<i>Je vous</i>
<i>attendais</i>
<i>ce matin</i>

07:57.810 --> 07:58.978
<i>et vous n'avez pas telephone.</i>

07:59.061 --> 08:02.106
{\an1}<i>Uh, excusez-moi,</i>
<i>mais parlez-vous anglais?</i>

08:02.190 --> 08:05.902
{\an1}<i>Oui,</i> but you are in
the immersion program,<i> non?</i>

08:05.985 --> 08:09.530
{\an1}And all the girls, they love for
<i>me</i> to speak French with them.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.573
Oh, we just
had a really

08:10.656 --> 08:11.949
long trip, and I don't think

08:12.033 --> 08:14.076
{\an1}we're completely ready
to immerse yet.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.578
{\an1}Except, of course,
in a bathtub.

08:15.661 --> 08:16.704
<i>Oh, mais oui.</i>

08:16.787 --> 08:18.915
Forgive me, you are tired.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.625
But you are very late,<i> non?</i>

08:20.708 --> 08:22.627
{\an1}Three people, they ask me
for my last room

08:22.710 --> 08:24.629
and I said,<i> non,</i>
it is fully paid.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.631
I must hold it for the girls.

08:26.881 --> 08:30.635
{\an1}<i>Voila!</i> And all of
our rooms have names.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.135
This one is "Marie."

08:38.308 --> 08:39.602
{\an1}Well,

08:39.684 --> 08:41.729
{\an1}you know,
I am sure that

08:41.812 --> 08:43.438
it's got a really...

08:43.522 --> 08:43.856
really nice...

08:49.237 --> 08:50.571
{\an1}...window.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.075
And this is for your clothes.

08:54.158 --> 08:56.244
Ah! And the towels are <i> ici.</i>

08:56.327 --> 08:56.953
{\an1}Whoa.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.789
This is for
<i>our</i> clothes?

08:59.872 --> 09:01.624
{\an1}<i>All</i> of our
clothes?

09:01.707 --> 09:04.669
<i>Both</i> of our clothes?

09:04.752 --> 09:05.753
I need to sit down.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.090
{\an1}(sighs)

09:09.173 --> 09:09.799
{\an1}Oh.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.634
Kelly must've had ESP.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.844
You know, Donna, it's not like

09:13.928 --> 09:14.845
{\an1}we're gonna be spending
any time in our room.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.139
(DuBois laughs)

09:17.223 --> 09:19.100
{\an1}You will be in the
program all day

09:19.183 --> 09:21.352
{\an1}and out with the
parties all night.

09:21.435 --> 09:22.478
{\an1}See?

09:22.562 --> 09:23.813
Knock, knock.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.106
{\an1}DUBOIS:
Oh,<i> allo,</i> Maggie!

09:25.189 --> 09:26.607
Please tell the girls

09:26.691 --> 09:29.652
{\an1}they will be too busy
in Paris even to sleep!

09:29.735 --> 09:31.320
{\an1}<i>Ah, oui.</i>

09:31.404 --> 09:33.990
{\an1}We shall give ourselves
to our French lovers

09:34.073 --> 09:35.825
and then go home with
broken hearts, but...

09:35.908 --> 09:38.744
{\an1}a lifetime
of memories.

09:39.870 --> 09:40.997
Hi. I'm Maggie,

09:41.080 --> 09:42.790
and these two creeps
are Lynnette and Ann.

09:42.873 --> 09:45.918
I will leave you
to make friends.

09:47.795 --> 09:51.465
{\an1}We just wanted to see
who got stuck with "Marie."

09:51.549 --> 09:53.634
{\an1}(giggling)

09:53.718 --> 09:54.719
{\an1}<i>A bientot.</i>

09:54.802 --> 09:57.013
Don't mind them.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.514
{\an1}We won't.

09:58.597 --> 09:59.849
I'm Brenda, and
this is Donna.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.684
{\an1}HHi.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.727
Well, cheer up, Donna.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.812
Look, I got stuck
with "Antoinette"

10:04.895 --> 10:06.564
{\an1}and it ain't
a whole lot better.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.232
{\an1}Great.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.650
{\an1}Look, Donna, we
can either complain

10:09.734 --> 10:11.027
{\an1}all summer or make
the best of it,

10:11.110 --> 10:11.944
but if you're gonna
sit around and mope,

10:12.028 --> 10:13.821
{\an1}I'm gonna go take a
bath-- which is where?

10:13.904 --> 10:16.324
Try the third floor,
end of the hallway.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.158
{\an1}Oh.

10:17.241 --> 10:19.744
{\an1}Oh, and the water
heater takes tokens.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.996
Oh, my God.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.372
I've got to call David.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.874
Oh, there's a pay phone
in the, uh, courtyard.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.209
Don't do it, Donna.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.253
{\an1}Look, if you call him
before you get settled in,

10:29.337 --> 10:30.713
you'll get even
more homesick.

10:30.796 --> 10:33.007
{\an1}Where are you guys
from, anyway?

10:34.592 --> 10:35.718
Uh, Los Angeles.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.512
Where in Los Angeles?

10:38.596 --> 10:40.723
Uh... West Lost Angeles.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.975
What high school?

10:44.894 --> 10:47.021
West Beverly High.

10:47.104 --> 10:47.813
{\an1}I knew it.

10:50.775 --> 10:51.942
{\an1}So...

10:52.026 --> 10:54.737
anybody got a cigarette?

10:58.491 --> 10:59.617
{\an1}JAY:
<i>I gotta give you credit.</i>

10:59.700 --> 11:01.619
{\an1}<i>I don't think</i>
<i>I could last one day</i>

11:01.702 --> 11:02.370
{\an1}<i>baby-sitting</i>
<i>those little tykes.</i>

11:02.453 --> 11:04.413
{\an1}Actually, it's
a pretty good job.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.247
{\an1}Of course, it
doesn't compare

11:05.331 --> 11:07.083
to hobnobbing with
the bigwigs at CNN.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.376
Yeah, right.

11:08.459 --> 11:09.752
The bureau chief still
doesn't know my name.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.003
So you're paying your dues.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.421
They're still taking you

11:12.505 --> 11:14.715
{\an1}to the Republican convention,
aren't they?

11:14.799 --> 11:16.592
{\an1}We leave for Houston
next week.

11:16.675 --> 11:17.760
{\an1}That sounds
a little more exciting

11:17.843 --> 11:19.136
{\an1}than digging for sand crabs
all summer.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.971
{\an1}Well, you want me
to talk to Mr. Rouse,

11:21.055 --> 11:22.932
{\an1}see if they have any
more intern jobs?

11:23.015 --> 11:24.934
Yeah, right.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.143
{\an1}Like they'd hire anybody
who's still in high school.

11:26.227 --> 11:29.688
{\an1}That's exactly who they hire
since they pay next to nothing.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.607
{\an1}So you want me
to check it out?

11:31.690 --> 11:32.817
Are you kidding?

11:32.900 --> 11:37.613
I'd love it, even if it is the
Republican National Convention.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.740
{\an1}It gives me a chance
to smoke out the enemy.

11:39.824 --> 11:40.908
{\an1}The enemy?

11:40.991 --> 11:42.952
What are you talking about?

11:43.035 --> 11:45.788
I'm a Republican.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.959
You're kidding, right?

11:50.042 --> 11:52.837
Horror of horrors.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.132
{\an1}And it doesn't bother you that
I'm a card-carrying liberal?

11:56.215 --> 11:58.509
Well, you know what
they say about girls

11:58.592 --> 11:59.135
who are liberal, don't you?

11:59.218 --> 12:01.971
{\an1}No.
What do they say, Jay?

12:02.054 --> 12:05.933
{\an1}It's rumored
that they're very...

12:06.016 --> 12:08.144
{\an1}liberal.

12:08.227 --> 12:11.272
{\an1}And you know what they say
about conservatives, don't you?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.859
They're lousy lovers.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.319
{\an1}Who says?

12:17.403 --> 12:19.822
My lips are sealed.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.157
{\an1}Well, why don't you
just stand up

12:21.240 --> 12:23.159
{\an1}and let me prove to you
how wrong you are.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.326
{\an1}Jay...

12:24.410 --> 12:25.661
Come on, Andrea.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.830
{\an1}How am I supposed to uphold
the honor and dignity

12:27.913 --> 12:29.748
of the Grand Old Party
if you just sit there?

12:29.832 --> 12:30.833
{\an1}Jay...

12:30.916 --> 12:32.835
{\an1}Don't tell me
a "card-carrying liberal"

12:32.918 --> 12:33.794
is too bashful to commit

12:33.878 --> 12:37.548
{\an1}to a little public
display of affection.

12:37.631 --> 12:39.925
{\an1}Okay...

12:45.598 --> 12:48.684
{\an1}(cheering)

12:50.936 --> 12:55.608
{\an1}William F. Buckley has
nothing on you, boy.

13:03.741 --> 13:07.369
{\an1}Isn't that weird how they're
doing that with their fingers?

13:07.453 --> 13:08.871
Yeah, it is.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.539
{\an4}You know what
they're doing--
they're signing.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.999
{\an1}That's how deaf people
talk to each other

13:12.082 --> 13:13.000
and it's not nice
to stare, so stop.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.960
Come on, down the slide.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.882
{\an1}Hi.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.717
I'm Andrea.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.385
What's your name?

13:23.469 --> 13:24.220
His name is Cameron.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.263
{\an1}Hi. I'm Andrea Zuckerman.
How are you?

13:26.347 --> 13:27.306
{\an1}Hi.

13:27.389 --> 13:28.766
{\an1}Ellen Shaw.
Nice to meet you.

13:28.849 --> 13:29.934
Nice to meet you.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.060
How did you learn to sign?

13:31.143 --> 13:34.688
I used to do volunteer work
at the Valley Youth Center

13:34.772 --> 13:36.815
{\an1}and there were some hearing
impaired kids there,

13:36.899 --> 13:40.778
so I thought I should learn
how to speak their language.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.572
Nice. Not many people
would make the effort.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.865
{\an1}It's fun.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.367
You'd better watch out

13:46.450 --> 13:48.702
or you're going to get
sand in your sandwich.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.497
I don't like eating sand.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.916
What? You like eating sand?

13:53.999 --> 13:57.753
{\an1}No, I said I hate sand
in my food.

13:57.836 --> 14:01.257
Oh, you hate eating sand.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.716
{\an1}Me, too.

14:05.719 --> 14:08.389
{\an1}Look, Mrs. Shaw,
there's no reason Cameron

14:08.472 --> 14:09.265
has to sit alone all summer.

14:09.348 --> 14:12.476
{\an1}Why don't you sign him
up for beach camp?

14:13.852 --> 14:15.646
I don't think so.

14:15.729 --> 14:17.439
He'll be okay.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.441
{\an1}I mean, I can take care
of him, really.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.901
You don't have to worry.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.112
I just don't think
it would work out.

14:23.195 --> 14:24.280
But thank you for asking.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.781
It was nice
meeting you.

14:25.864 --> 14:27.449
Nice meeting you, too.

14:27.533 --> 14:31.203
{\an1}Come on, honey, time
to come out of the sun.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.297
{\an1}BRENDA:
You know there's something

14:41.380 --> 14:43.257
{\an1}about being in a city that's
over 2,000 years old.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.134
{\an1}It gives you such
a sense of history.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.136
{\an4}DONNA:
Brenda, my feet
are killing me!

14:47.219 --> 14:48.929
Donna, I can't believe
in all those suitcases

14:49.013 --> 14:51.140
{\an1}you didn't find a decent
pair of walking shoes.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.641
Brenda, you're nagging again.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.185
Yeah, well, our next
stop is not too far.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.979
No, no more.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.606
I need a nap.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.815
{\an1}Donna, they strongly
recommended

14:59.898 --> 15:02.693
{\an1}that we see as many landmarks as
possible before classes start.

15:02.776 --> 15:05.154
{\an1}Well, I think we ought to be
excused on account of jet lag.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.948
<i>Levez-vous, s'il vous plaît.</i>

15:09.074 --> 15:11.702
David has that same shirt.

15:11.785 --> 15:13.996
{\an1}Well, I mean
it's not exactly the same shirt,

15:14.079 --> 15:15.456
but it's it's the same color.

15:17.124 --> 15:21.462
Well, it's not exactly
the same color, but...

15:21.545 --> 15:23.130
{\an1}Donna, do you want
to go find a phone booth?

15:23.213 --> 15:25.507
{\an1}No.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.469
{\an1}I mean, we both agreed to tough
it out as long as possible,

15:28.552 --> 15:31.847
{\an1}and if you can wait,
I can wait.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.849
{\an1}Attagirl.

15:33.932 --> 15:35.684
{\an1}All right,
let's see what's next?

15:35.768 --> 15:38.687
{\an1}Why don't we go to Balzac's
House and then call it a day?

15:38.771 --> 15:41.357
{\an1}Okay.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.861
{\an1}Why don't we skip Balzac's
House and call it a day?

15:45.944 --> 15:48.530
{\an4}Donna, I'm sure if we
just give it a few more
minutes, we will find it.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.867
{\an1}Other people come to Paris,
they go to see the Eiffel Tower,

15:51.950 --> 15:54.078
{\an4}take a stroll
down the Champs Elysées,
do a little shopping.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.079
What am I doing?

15:55.162 --> 15:56.747
I'm going to see
Balzac's House.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.791
{\an1}It was on the list,
and in the neighborhood.

15:58.874 --> 16:00.834
Oh, great. Who even
cares about Balzac?

16:00.918 --> 16:02.586
Now I could understand

16:02.670 --> 16:04.963
{\an1}if it was Pierre Cardin's
house, but...

16:05.047 --> 16:06.131
{\an1}Donna, you don't want
to be here, fine.

16:06.215 --> 16:08.175
{\an1}Why don't you get on the metro,
and go back to the hotel!

16:08.258 --> 16:09.718
Uh, Brenda...

16:09.802 --> 16:11.261
{\an1}I mean, stay there
all summer.

16:11.345 --> 16:14.014
{\an1}Better yet, why don't you just
go back to Beverly Hills,

16:14.098 --> 16:16.684
{\an1}live your same old princess life
with your same old people.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.727
But you can do
it without me.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.645
Because I am going
to take advantage

16:19.728 --> 16:21.939
{\an1}of every little bit
this city has to offer.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.566
{\an1}I mean I'm not rushing
to call Dylan

16:24.650 --> 16:26.568
{\an1}the minute I get here, because
everything's not perfect.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.946
{\an1}I am going to "immerse", I am
going to speak French

16:29.029 --> 16:30.781
{\an1}and I am going to find
Balzac's House

16:30.864 --> 16:31.532
if it's the last thing I do.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.785
{\an1}Good. Well, if
you're finished...

16:34.868 --> 16:37.955
I think the word is: <i> voila?</i>

16:40.040 --> 16:42.292
We're here, let's go!

16:48.716 --> 16:50.592
I don't believe it.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.886
It's uh, closed.

16:52.970 --> 16:53.178
{\an1}What?

16:59.685 --> 17:02.146
All right, here we go.

17:02.229 --> 17:05.273
Good girl. Go get it.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.275
{\an1}Guess who.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.234
{\an1}Uh... uh,
Dan Quayle.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.236
{\an1}(chuckles)

17:09.319 --> 17:10.404
I was close.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.446
{\an1}Now, listen,
I have terrific news.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.906
I talked to my producer

17:12.990 --> 17:15.117
{\an1}and he said if you're willing
to work 24 hours a day

17:15.200 --> 17:16.285
for next to no money,
he'd love to have you.

17:16.367 --> 17:19.788
{\an1}Start packing, babe.
We're going to Houston.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.749
{\an1}That's great!
You're a miracle worker.

17:21.832 --> 17:22.958
That's so good!

17:23.040 --> 17:24.126
I had incentive.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.712
{\an1}This way I get to spend
the rest of the summer with you.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.422
{\an1}Oh!

17:28.505 --> 17:32.009
Oh, I'm so excited,
oh, that's so cool!

17:32.092 --> 17:35.429
I can't wait.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.902
{\an1}Pinch me.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.445
{\an1}I still can't believe
I'm not dreaming.

17:51.528 --> 17:54.031
{\an1}Hey, chalk one up to the
dreams come true department.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.659
{\an1}She's trying to make you
jealous, you know.

17:57.743 --> 17:58.911
{\an1}What?

17:58.994 --> 18:01.997
Girls pull stunts like this to
make you realize you like them.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.165
Steve, that's ridiculous.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.334
{\an1}Why are you staring
at her then?

18:05.417 --> 18:07.669
I wasn't staring.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.630
{\an1}Well, if you're gonna
make a move, buddy,

18:09.713 --> 18:11.298
{\an1}you'd better do it
before it's too late.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.850
{\an1}(sighs)

18:23.268 --> 18:25.687
Okay, go on.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.524
{\an1}Careful.

18:28.607 --> 18:29.650
{\an1}Hello.

18:29.733 --> 18:30.692
Hi, Cameron.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.069
Can I join that group?

18:32.152 --> 18:35.322
Sure you can join the group.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.240
{\an1}Did your mother
give you permission?

18:38.408 --> 18:39.326
{\an1}Terrific.

18:39.409 --> 18:40.327
Come on over.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.370
(whistle blowing)

18:41.453 --> 18:46.542
{\an1}Group, come over here.
Come on over.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.752
Gang, this is Cameron.

18:48.836 --> 18:49.837
Cameron, this is the gang.

18:49.920 --> 18:50.921
{\an1}Say, hi.

18:51.004 --> 18:51.630
{\an1}ALL:
Hi.

18:53.131 --> 18:55.717
Well, don't just stand there.

18:55.801 --> 18:56.844
Let's go swimming.

18:56.927 --> 18:57.469
Come on, go for it!

18:59.388 --> 19:01.473
What's going on here?

19:05.811 --> 19:07.271
{\an1}Cameron, I've been
looking all over for you.

19:07.354 --> 19:10.399
How many times do
I have to tell you

19:10.482 --> 19:11.775
{\an1}not to wander off
like that?

19:11.859 --> 19:12.901
He said he had your permission.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.570
And you believed him?

19:14.653 --> 19:15.904
I'm sorry, Mrs. Shaw.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.114
I was frantic.

19:17.197 --> 19:20.075
I'm really sorry.

19:20.158 --> 19:22.953
Well, thank God,
he's all right.

19:23.036 --> 19:25.414
{\an1}Mrs. Shaw, excuse me
for saying this,

19:25.497 --> 19:28.083
{\an1}but just because Cameron
has special needs,

19:28.166 --> 19:30.294
{\an1}doesn't mean he can't have
fun with the rest of us.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.296
Andrea, as you've just noticed,

19:32.379 --> 19:34.256
{\an1}Cameron has a tendency
to wander off.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.757
All children do,

19:35.841 --> 19:38.594
{\an1}but when a deaf child gets lost,
you can't just call his name.

19:38.677 --> 19:41.555
{\an1}So I have to watch
him like a hawk.

19:41.638 --> 19:42.806
How are you going to do that

19:42.890 --> 19:44.349
{\an1}with eight other children
to look after?

19:46.184 --> 19:48.604
We'll set up a buddy system.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.272
We'll make rules.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.773
Please, Mrs. Shaw.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.943
It's not fair to isolate him
any more than he already is.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.738
{\an1}Andrea...

19:57.821 --> 20:02.451
{\an1}Thank you,
you're very kind.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.828
{\an1}I'm sorry.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.246
It's just impossible.

20:06.330 --> 20:09.917
It's just day camp... one day.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.628
There's no
commitment.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.213
Please, just try it.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.475
Okay, you win.

20:26.558 --> 20:29.561
{\an1}What?

20:31.730 --> 20:33.607
{\an1}Cameron can join
your group.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.817
That's terrific!

20:43.909 --> 20:45.827
{\an1}So, Kelly recommended
this place?

20:45.911 --> 20:47.955
{\an1}Yeah, but she didn't warn
me it was so dressy.

20:48.038 --> 20:48.455
{\an1}<i>Regardez</i>
that outfit.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.624
{\an1}Ooh-la-la!

20:50.707 --> 20:53.543
{\an1}We definitely have
to check out "le shopping".

20:53.627 --> 20:55.379
{\an4}We will, but not until we
are speaking French just
like the natives.

20:55.462 --> 20:59.257
{\an1}Come on, Bren, haven't you heard
the expression, "money talks"?

20:59.341 --> 21:01.510
{\an1}Yeah, and I don't have
a whole lot of it.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.054
{\an1}Besides, I don't want people
to take a look at us

21:04.137 --> 21:06.640
{\an1}and say "stupid tourists,
let's take advantage of them."

21:06.723 --> 21:09.518
{\an1}You can't show
any weakness here,

21:09.601 --> 21:11.436
you can't let on that you're
not right on top of things.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.189
{\an1}And now is a great time
to start.

21:14.272 --> 21:16.566
{\an1}<i>Votre command,</i>
<i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

21:16.650 --> 21:18.527
{\an1}Oh, here.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.617
Bren, this is all in French.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.496
{\an1}<i>Je voudrais le poisson,</i>
<i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

21:29.579 --> 21:31.707
<i>Quel Poisson?</i>

21:31.790 --> 21:33.542
{\an1}<i>Nous avons 26</i>
<i>poissons différents!</i>

21:33.625 --> 21:35.168
{\an1}Um...

21:35.252 --> 21:37.045
{\an1}<i>La coquis St. Jacques,</i>
<i>la dorade,</i>

21:37.129 --> 21:37.921
<i>le rouget, la sole...</i>

21:38.005 --> 21:40.215
{\an1}<i>La sole. Très bien.</i>
<i>S'il vous plaît.</i>

21:40.298 --> 21:41.216
{\an1}<i>Merci.</i>
<i>Et vous?</i>

21:41.299 --> 21:43.552
{\an1}Oh. Um...

21:43.635 --> 21:45.012
{\an1}Oh, God...

21:45.095 --> 21:47.723
{\an1}(deliberately):
I don't want fish.

21:49.766 --> 21:52.185
One, one sec...

22:01.319 --> 22:01.737
This... please.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.613
<i>S'il vous plaît.</i>

22:03.697 --> 22:04.740
{\an1}<i>Cervelles de Veau.</i>
<i>Très bien.</i>

22:04.823 --> 22:05.949
What's that?

22:06.033 --> 22:07.534
"Veau" is veal.

22:07.617 --> 22:08.577
Oh, that sounds good.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.578
Garcon, make that <i> deux.</i>

22:09.661 --> 22:11.705
<i>Tres bien, mademoiselle.</i>

22:13.040 --> 22:14.750
{\an1}You see? That wasn't
so hard, was it?

22:14.833 --> 22:16.209
Bon appetit.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.502
Bon appetit.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.590
{\an1}ANDREA:
All right, be careful, now.

22:21.673 --> 22:22.799
Good. Good toss.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.552
{\an1}Okay. All right,
careful now.

22:25.635 --> 22:28.096
{\an1}If you toss it too hard
it's going to break, right?

22:28.180 --> 22:30.265
{\an1}All right, Andrew,
good pass, good pass.

22:30.348 --> 22:32.768
{\an1}Oh, my God, oh, my God,
that was good.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.394
Throw it well.

22:34.478 --> 22:35.437
Don't break it,
don't break it.

22:35.520 --> 22:36.605
It's not over yet.

22:36.688 --> 22:37.898
{\an1}In coming.

22:38.523 --> 22:39.566
Don't you, don't you dare.

22:39.649 --> 22:41.818
{\an1}Don't you even
think it.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.070
Don't, don't...

22:43.153 --> 22:43.695
Get her, get her.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.739
Whose side are you on, huh?

22:45.822 --> 22:48.617
Ready, aim... fire!

22:48.700 --> 22:50.077
Oh, my God.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.161
Game's over.

22:51.244 --> 22:52.287
{\an1}Everybody in
the water.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.122
Come on, game's over.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.626
{\an1}Hey, I heard about
your new job.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.669
{\an1}Yeah.
What a hoot, huh?

22:59.753 --> 23:01.630
{\an1}Andrea Zuckerman
at the Republican Convention.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.424
{\an1}So, what are you planning
to tell Henry?

23:04.508 --> 23:05.008
I already did.

23:05.092 --> 23:05.675
He gave me his blessings.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.636
And what about the kids?

23:07.719 --> 23:08.678
What about 'em?

23:08.762 --> 23:11.473
{\an1}There are plenty of people
who can run day camps.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.183
{\an1}Henry's got
that girl from Beverly

23:13.266 --> 23:14.309
just waiting in the wings.

23:14.392 --> 23:15.685
That may be true,

23:15.769 --> 23:18.271
{\an1}but I'm sure she doesn't know
how to sign for the deaf.

23:24.611 --> 23:26.279
ThNo, it isn't.ow.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.656
{\an1}You went out of your way to drag
that kid into your group.

23:27.739 --> 23:29.658
{\an1}Now he's having
the time of his life

23:29.741 --> 23:30.826
and you're just gonna dump him.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.536
Excuse me, this was not
a lifetime commitment.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.538
His mom knows that.

23:34.621 --> 23:35.497
Does Cameron?

23:35.580 --> 23:37.624
Since when are you so worried

23:37.707 --> 23:39.334
{\an1}about the feelings
of a little boy?

23:39.417 --> 23:41.503
{\an1}I'm glad this is
so easy for you, Andrea.

23:41.586 --> 23:43.839
Thank you, Brandon.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.424
I'm glad you're glad.

23:52.764 --> 23:55.016
All I can say is, the food
better be worth the wait.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.309
{\an1}Me, too.

23:56.393 --> 23:59.729
{\an1}I am starving,
I'm famished, I'm...

23:59.813 --> 24:01.439
{\an1}David?

24:09.781 --> 24:11.700
{\an1}I thought it was David
for a second.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.744
You've really got it bad.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.246
What do I have?

24:16.329 --> 24:17.706
The dependent woman syndrome.

24:17.789 --> 24:18.707
I read about it in a magazine.

24:18.790 --> 24:21.334
{\an1}You're imagining
that you see David

24:21.418 --> 24:24.713
{\an1}because you can't accept the
idea of your own independence.

24:24.796 --> 24:25.714
I just miss him, that's all.

24:25.797 --> 24:30.218
{\an1}Donna, you can't fall
into that old stereotype,

24:30.302 --> 24:32.721
you know, the clinging female
who lives and dies by her man.

24:32.804 --> 24:35.182
Look who's talking?

24:35.265 --> 24:36.558
I mean, David and I are dating.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.768
But you and Dylan were, were
what, like, living together.

24:38.852 --> 24:39.603
No, we were playing house.

24:39.686 --> 24:41.938
And that's partly
why I came here--

24:42.022 --> 24:44.149
{\an1}to see what it takes
to be my own boss,

24:44.232 --> 24:44.858
{\an1}not to be Daddy's
little girl,

24:44.941 --> 24:46.610
or my boyfriends' little woman.

24:46.693 --> 24:49.654
{\an1}Hmm, and I thought we were
just out to have fun.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.282
{\an1}Well, we will, if you'd just
give it half a chance.

24:52.365 --> 24:53.575
{\an1}You know, Bren, I'd be having
a great time

24:53.658 --> 24:56.369
{\an1}if my dinner
would just get here.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.621
{\an1}Okay, but just think
about what I'm saying,

24:57.704 --> 24:59.915
{\an1}otherwise it's going to be
a really long summer.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.876
<i>Cervelles de Veau.</i>

25:06.338 --> 25:08.715
Wait a second.

25:08.798 --> 25:11.927
I ordered veal.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.595
{\an1}<i>Mais oui.</i>
<i>Cervelles de veau.</i>

25:13.678 --> 25:16.014
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

25:17.807 --> 25:20.101
I don't know about this.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.728
Okay, it looks weird.

25:21.811 --> 25:24.105
But I'm sure it's edible.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.816
Great, right now, I could
eat just about anything.

25:38.536 --> 25:41.456
It's very, uh... French.

25:41.539 --> 25:44.709
It's, uh, it's kind of... mushy.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.887
It's brains.

25:58.556 --> 25:59.683
{\an1}Wow.

26:01.893 --> 26:05.272
{\an1}Uh, from now on,
let's just stick to fish.

26:08.191 --> 26:08.900
No problem.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.325
{\an1}I hope you're planning to
recycle all that paper.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.326
{\an1}Hi, Kel.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.829
{\an1}What are you writing,
the great American novel?

26:20.912 --> 26:22.455
Hardly. It's a letter.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.249
Well, tell Brenda I said hello.

26:24.332 --> 26:25.834
It's not a letter to Brenda.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.003
It's for my father.
He's up for parole.

26:28.086 --> 26:28.878
{\an1}Yeah.
I heard that on the news.

26:28.962 --> 26:31.840
{\an1}I'm supposed to write
this glowing letter

26:31.923 --> 26:33.008
to convince the parole board

26:33.091 --> 26:36.011
{\an1}what a fabulous father
he is, you know.

26:36.094 --> 26:36.845
{\an1}Needless to say, the words
aren't coming easy.

26:36.928 --> 26:40.974
I'll just leave you alone, then.

26:41.057 --> 26:41.808
No, I need a break.

26:41.891 --> 26:44.394
{\an1}You want to get a soda
or something?

26:44.477 --> 26:45.895
{\an1}Sure.

26:47.814 --> 26:48.690
So, how's it going?

26:48.773 --> 26:51.151
Not so hot.

26:51.234 --> 26:54.988
{\an1}Things with Jake and I
didn't go so well.

26:55.071 --> 26:58.033
{\an1}Oh, you know I told him
not to mess with you.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.701
{\an1}You talked to him
about me?

26:59.784 --> 27:00.243
{\an1}Yeah.

27:00.327 --> 27:04.664
I really got sucked in.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.041
{\an1}I ended up throwing
myself at him.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.418
Yeah, well, some people
have that kind of power.

27:08.501 --> 27:11.713
{\an1}Can I have a couple of mineral
water's, please?

27:11.796 --> 27:13.798
Well, I guess I'm done
with guys for a while.

27:13.882 --> 27:17.385
{\an1}But thanks for trying
to look out for me.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.846
Hey, come on, we were in

27:19.929 --> 27:21.598
{\an1}the same kindergarten class,
remember?

27:21.681 --> 27:23.475
That's right.

27:23.558 --> 27:23.850
Miss Carney.

27:23.933 --> 27:26.227
As I recall,

27:26.311 --> 27:27.896
you were the king
of "quiet time."

27:30.106 --> 27:33.068
{\an1}So you're having a hard time
with this letter?

27:33.151 --> 27:37.697
{\an1}Yeah, I just can't come up
with a single flattering thing

27:37.781 --> 27:40.241
{\an1}to say about my own father
that I actually believe.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.370
Well, when in doubt, lie.

27:45.038 --> 27:46.831
I may have to.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.253
{\an1}Hey, Andrea,
where are you off to?

27:52.337 --> 27:53.463
I havOh. date.

27:53.546 --> 27:56.257
{\an1}Hey, listen, what do you want
to go running off with that guy

27:56.341 --> 27:57.634
to Houston for anyway, huh?

27:57.717 --> 27:58.635
Don't you approve?

27:58.718 --> 28:00.220
{\an1}I don't need your permission
to do this, Brandon.

28:00.303 --> 28:01.012
No, it's, it's not that.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.139
It's... I just kind of wish

28:03.223 --> 28:03.807
{\an1}you were sticking around
here for the summer.

28:03.890 --> 28:05.934
I'm gonna miss
riding to work

28:06.017 --> 28:08.269
with you every morning,

28:08.353 --> 28:09.771
{\an1}and helping you out
with the kids.

28:09.854 --> 28:10.939
That's sweet.

28:11.022 --> 28:13.817
{\an1}But most of all
I'm gonna miss you.

28:15.527 --> 28:15.985
{\an1}Brandon...

28:24.077 --> 28:27.205
What the hell was that?

28:27.872 --> 28:31.626
It's just how I feel.

28:31.709 --> 28:34.754
{\an1}Look, don't insult me
like that, okay. Not now.

28:34.838 --> 28:36.631
{\an1}Hey wait, wait, what
are you talking about?

28:36.714 --> 28:39.467
{\an1}The only reason you're the
slightest bit interested in me

28:39.551 --> 28:41.261
{\an1}is because I'm seeing someone
else, and you know it.

28:41.344 --> 28:42.679
That's not true.

28:42.762 --> 28:43.805
{\an1}Oh, yeah?

28:43.888 --> 28:46.766
Then where have you been the
last couple years, Brandon?

28:46.850 --> 28:47.809
You had your chance,

28:47.892 --> 28:49.853
you made your choice.

28:49.936 --> 28:53.314
{\an1}I'd appreciate it
if you'd get out of my way

28:53.398 --> 28:54.649
because I have a date.

28:54.732 --> 28:56.776
So break it.

28:59.904 --> 29:02.282
{\an1}What makes you think you're
so damn irresistible?

29:10.373 --> 29:13.001
Red Rover, Red Rover,
let Cameron come over.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.712
Go, Cameron, go.

29:15.795 --> 29:18.882
Come on, you can
do it. Come on!

29:18.965 --> 29:20.800
{\an1}Yay!

29:20.884 --> 29:23.178
Cameron, good work.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.722
{\an1}All right!

29:25.805 --> 29:27.056
{\an1}Good work.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.726
{\an1}BRANDON:
Tell me something, Steve--

29:29.809 --> 29:31.811
{\an1}what is it about guys
that makes them

29:31.895 --> 29:33.813
suddenly want the one
girl they can't have?

29:33.897 --> 29:34.856
{\an1}I don't know, I think
it's hormonal.

29:34.939 --> 29:37.150
(whistle blowing)

29:37.233 --> 29:38.526
Okay, lunchtime.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.361
Let's go, come on.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.030
Everybody, one, two, three,

29:42.113 --> 29:44.824
{\an1}run, run, run,
let's go.

29:47.285 --> 29:48.536
Andrea. Andrea, hey...

29:48.620 --> 29:49.746
Not now, Brandon.

29:49.829 --> 29:52.749
{\an1}No, come on, please just listen
to me for one minute, okay?

29:54.792 --> 29:56.711
I didn't sleep much last night.

29:56.794 --> 29:59.547
{\an1}I was thinking a lot about
what I did and what you said.

29:59.631 --> 30:00.089
{\an1}And?

30:00.173 --> 30:03.676
And you were right.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.678
{\an1}I'm sorry.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.680
{\an1}I didn't mean to offend
you or insult you.

30:07.764 --> 30:10.850
Apology accepted.

30:11.976 --> 30:14.521
{\an1}TMm-hmm.t?

30:14.604 --> 30:16.189
{\an1}Just like that,
apology accepted?

30:16.272 --> 30:18.733
You know, you have every reason
in the world to think I'm scum.

30:18.816 --> 30:19.067
{\an1}Pond scum.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.944
{\an1}Pond scum.

30:21.027 --> 30:22.904
With lousy timing.

30:22.987 --> 30:25.406
{\an1}So, uh...

30:25.490 --> 30:27.033
we're still friends.

30:27.116 --> 30:29.702
Always friends.

30:29.786 --> 30:31.704
{\an1}Cool.

30:34.916 --> 30:38.586
You really like him, don't you?

30:38.670 --> 30:42.590
Yeah. I really do.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.092
That's good.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.593
I'm happy for you.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.971
{\an1}But I have to admit
you did call it.

30:48.054 --> 30:51.808
{\an1}You never know what you've got
till it's gone.

30:51.891 --> 30:54.769
{\an1}Thanks.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.740
<i>"Comment vous appellez-vous?"</i>

31:07.824 --> 31:09.075
<i>Comment vous appellez-vous?</i>

31:09.158 --> 31:11.452
<i>"Je m'appelle Donna."</i>

31:11.536 --> 31:13.371
<i>Je m'appelle Donna.</i>

31:13.454 --> 31:15.123
<i>Très bien, mademoiselle.</i>

31:15.206 --> 31:16.916
Bren, it's easy to
repeat after you,

31:17.000 --> 31:18.918
{\an1}but I was totally lost
in class today.

31:19.002 --> 31:21.296
{\an1}How am I supposed to understand
anyone at the party?

31:21.379 --> 31:22.964
{\an1}Donna, I'm sure someone
there will speak English.

31:23.047 --> 31:26.926
{\an1}And even if they don't, flirting
is a universal language.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.304
Brenda, I'm not out
to pick anyone up.

31:29.387 --> 31:30.221
{\an1}Besides I would never
do that to David.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.640
{\an1}Donna, this has nothing
to do with David.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.143
{\an1}All I'm saying is that
it's quite possible

31:35.226 --> 31:36.144
{\an1}you might enjoy talking
to some cute Parisian guys.

31:36.227 --> 31:38.187
{\an1}And if you really want to,
you'll find a way.

31:38.271 --> 31:41.649
{\an1}I know.
I just miss David so much.

31:41.733 --> 31:42.984
{\an1}I keep thinking I see him,
everywhere that I go.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.945
I miss Dylan, too.

31:46.029 --> 31:47.614
{\an1}It's just that
I'm not obsessing over it.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.198
I mean, he's there and I'm here.

31:49.282 --> 31:53.286
{\an1}Well, it's harder for me because
of that language "thang".

31:53.369 --> 31:55.997
{\an1}All I can say is,
if Ann and Lynnette

31:56.080 --> 31:57.624
{\an1}can handle this program,
so can you.

31:57.707 --> 32:01.210
{\an1}Hmm, maybe it's their accents
that keep throwing me off.

32:01.294 --> 32:04.005
<i>"Je m'appelle Lynnette".</i>

32:04.088 --> 32:04.255
{\an1}(knocking)

32:04.339 --> 32:06.341
{\an1}Oops.

32:07.925 --> 32:09.802
{\an5}(Southern accent):
Y'all ready
to rock 'n' roll?

32:11.137 --> 32:13.014
Train's a movin' gal.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.474
{\an1}Are you creeps coming
or what?

32:14.557 --> 32:16.309
{\an1}Now remember, if you
get into trouble,

32:16.392 --> 32:19.687
{\an1}just ask where the bathroom
is: <i> "Ou est la toilette?"</i>

32:19.771 --> 32:20.813
{\an1}Got it?

32:21.773 --> 32:22.273
{\an1}<i>Mais oui.</i>

32:22.357 --> 32:25.234
<i>Bon. Allons-y.</i>

32:36.788 --> 32:38.790
{\an1}Oh, um...

32:42.293 --> 32:44.504
<i>Vous etes tres jolie.</i>

32:44.587 --> 32:47.674
{\an1}<i>Voulez-vous coucher</i>
<i>avec moi ce soir?</i>

32:47.757 --> 32:51.135
Um...<i> ou est la toilette?</i>

32:57.642 --> 32:59.227
{\an1}Oh, uh...

32:59.310 --> 33:01.521
<i>non, merci.</i>

33:19.872 --> 33:21.958
And where are you from?

33:22.041 --> 33:25.586
<i>Nous habitons en</i> Texas.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.588
What'd she say?

33:27.672 --> 33:28.256
They live in Texas.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.258
{\an1}Texas?

33:30.341 --> 33:34.429
{\an1}Do you know, uh, do you know,
uh, George Bush?

33:34.512 --> 33:35.722
{\an1}No.

33:41.561 --> 33:44.981
{\an1}Do you know,
um, Ross Perot?

33:45.064 --> 33:45.189
Do you know Ross Perot?

33:54.866 --> 33:56.325
{\an1}Excuse me.

33:57.243 --> 33:59.120
<i>Vous etes tres jolie.</i>

33:59.203 --> 34:01.789
{\an1}<i>Voulez-vous coucher</i>
<i>avec moi ce soir?</i>

34:01.873 --> 34:03.249
I sleep with her.

34:05.251 --> 34:09.672
{\an1}<i>Alors,</i> the more the merrier,
<i>n'est ce pas?</i>

34:09.755 --> 34:11.466
I don't think so.

34:19.389 --> 34:21.516
{\an1}Dylan!

34:21.601 --> 34:25.646
{\an1}Dylan...

34:25.730 --> 34:27.690
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

34:32.402 --> 34:34.614
(techno music playing)

34:36.532 --> 34:37.533
That's it, David!

34:37.617 --> 34:39.744
{\an1}You're gonna get us kicked out
of this club!

34:41.829 --> 34:42.955
{\an1}Hello.

34:43.039 --> 34:43.956
{\an1}Hi.

34:44.040 --> 34:44.498
Where are you off to?

34:44.581 --> 34:46.751
Uh, I'm going to jail.

34:48.543 --> 34:50.670
(both chuckle)

34:50.755 --> 34:52.465
{\an1}It's for
my father's parole hearing.

34:52.547 --> 34:53.341
Well, good luck.

34:53.424 --> 34:54.425
{\an1}Thanks.

35:03.643 --> 35:06.312
Hey, Dylan.

35:06.395 --> 35:08.022
{\an1}Nice suit.

35:08.105 --> 35:09.524
{\an1}Well, a little big
in the waist,

35:09.607 --> 35:10.691
but, uh, I been on

35:10.775 --> 35:11.776
{\an1}that prison diet
too long.

35:16.155 --> 35:17.698
This is some letter.

35:17.782 --> 35:18.658
Glad you liked it.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.328
{\an1}Guess I wasn't too bad
a father after all, huh?

35:22.411 --> 35:25.623
{\an1}Don't believe everything
you read.

35:30.086 --> 35:31.254
{\an1}"My father taught me
never to give up.

35:31.337 --> 35:35.466
"When I was six, I was having
trouble learning how to read.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.552
{\an1}"Every night,
no matter how busy he was,

35:37.635 --> 35:40.721
{\an1}"my father would sit with me
for hours.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.390
"It wasn't sinking in.

35:42.473 --> 35:45.393
{\an1}"But one night,
I looked at the words

35:45.476 --> 35:46.435
"and somehow it all clicked.

35:46.519 --> 35:49.355
{\an1}"I never thanked
my father for that.

35:49.438 --> 35:52.358
This is as good
a time as any."

35:52.441 --> 35:53.442
{\an1}There won't be a dry eye
in the house.

35:53.526 --> 35:57.405
Except what I wrote in that
letter wasn't really true.

35:57.488 --> 35:59.240
My mom taught me how to read.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.324
That's a lot of crap, Dylan.

36:02.660 --> 36:03.286
{\an1}You have
a damn selective memory.

36:03.369 --> 36:05.538
Come on, Dad.

36:05.621 --> 36:08.583
You were never around
to teach me to read,

36:08.666 --> 36:10.710
{\an1}you were never around
for anything.

36:10.793 --> 36:11.711
{\an1}Oh, yeah?

36:11.794 --> 36:14.589
"I do not like them in a plane,

36:14.672 --> 36:18.593
{\an1}"I do not like them
on a train.

36:18.676 --> 36:22.555
{\an1}I do not like green eggs
and ham..."

36:22.638 --> 36:26.100
"I do not like them, Sam I am."

36:32.690 --> 36:38.446
{\an1}Listen, kid,
whatever happens in there...

36:38.529 --> 36:41.407
I am glad that you're here.

36:41.490 --> 36:44.493
Good luck, Dad.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.579
Let's do it.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.425
You know, I've had

36:59.508 --> 37:00.426
{\an1}what I thought were French
pastries before,

37:00.509 --> 37:04.305
{\an1}but somehow they taste
so much better here. Bren?

37:04.388 --> 37:06.807
{\an1}Hmm?

37:06.891 --> 37:10.144
What's wrong?

37:10.228 --> 37:11.854
You know how you
keep on thinking

37:11.938 --> 37:12.980
that you're seeing David?

37:13.064 --> 37:14.482
{\an1}Yeah.

37:14.565 --> 37:16.359
Well, it started
happening to me.

37:16.442 --> 37:20.112
{\an1}And I started thinking,
"What are we doing here?"

37:20.196 --> 37:23.532
We're immersing.

37:23.616 --> 37:26.494
{\an1}We're learning new things
in a new language

37:26.577 --> 37:29.205
in a new culture.

37:31.374 --> 37:33.125
{\an1}Now I'm starting to learn
that being in one

37:33.209 --> 37:35.336
{\an1}of the most romantic cities
in the world isn't so romantic

37:35.419 --> 37:37.505
when you don't have someone
you love to share it with.

37:37.588 --> 37:43.260
Not that I don't love you,
but you know what I mean.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.470
Well, I guess
I haven't been

37:44.553 --> 37:46.514
{\an1}such a great traveling
companion.

37:46.597 --> 37:49.642
Well, you have been
complaining a bit,

37:49.725 --> 37:51.227
but I've been pretty bossy.

37:51.310 --> 37:56.691
You know, I'm really glad you
said that so I didn't have to.

37:59.652 --> 38:04.490
{\an1}We do do things our own way,
don't we?

38:04.573 --> 38:07.535
I don't know, I would hate for
people to look at me and think

38:07.618 --> 38:10.538
{\an1}that I was some pampered kid
from West Beverly High.

38:10.621 --> 38:15.543
{\an1}I really want
to be a whole person

38:15.626 --> 38:19.547
{\an1}with many sides, many talents
and many interests.

38:19.630 --> 38:22.675
{\an1}I just don't know
what they all are yet.

38:24.593 --> 38:28.556
{\an1}Bren, I have a confession
to make:

38:28.639 --> 38:30.558
{\an1}I'm really glad that you came
instead of Kelly.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.226
{\an1}Why?

38:32.309 --> 38:35.604
{\an1}Well, if she were here,
she'd be the one complaining,

38:35.688 --> 38:39.233
{\an1}and I, I would've felt
like I had to cheer her up.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.736
And honestly I just,

38:41.819 --> 38:43.612
I just haven't had it in me.

38:43.696 --> 38:47.742
{\an1}I hear ya.

38:47.825 --> 38:52.747
{\an1}You know, you're gonna be okay,
and I'm gonna be okay.

38:52.830 --> 38:55.541
{\an1}I mean, this is the summer
before our senior year.

38:55.624 --> 38:57.752
{\an1}We're gonna find out
what it's like

38:57.835 --> 38:59.211
to be on our own

38:59.295 --> 39:01.589
{\an1}and we are gonna have the time
of our lives.

39:01.672 --> 39:05.593
<i>Absolument!</i> (giggles)

39:05.676 --> 39:09.388
{\an1}So, uh, what was that time
difference again?

39:09.472 --> 39:11.640
I'll race you to the phone.

39:11.724 --> 39:13.976
{\an1}(giggles)

39:16.645 --> 39:19.607
An eleDumbo?

39:19.690 --> 39:20.608
{\an1}I got it!
I got it!

39:20.691 --> 39:21.609
Mickey Mouse!

39:21.692 --> 39:22.610
<i>Horton Hears a Who!</i>

39:22.693 --> 39:23.611
Bugs Bunny!

39:23.694 --> 39:24.779
{\an1}Yeah!

39:24.862 --> 39:29.283
{\an1}Hey, Cameron's team wins again!
Come on, you guys.

39:29.366 --> 39:30.284
{\an1}Hi.

39:30.367 --> 39:31.160
Hi, how are you?

39:31.243 --> 39:33.454
{\an1}Andrea, I just want
to thank you so much.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.581
{\an1}Cameron's having
such a terrific time.

39:35.664 --> 39:37.291
He's a great kid.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.126
{\an1}Yeah. Hmm.
I'm really sorry

39:39.210 --> 39:40.503
you're not gonna be around
for the rest of the summer.

39:40.586 --> 39:42.588
{\an1}You've had such
an impact on him.

39:42.671 --> 39:43.631
{\an1}Given him

39:43.714 --> 39:45.966
a terrific opportunity.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.719
He's going to miss all this.

39:50.721 --> 39:53.599
Thanks again.

40:08.531 --> 40:09.532
{\an1}Hey, sorry
about your dad.

40:09.615 --> 40:11.283
{\an1}I heard it
on the radio.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.786
{\an1}Uh, when they started
dragging out affidavits

40:13.869 --> 40:16.622
from, like, a hundred old women
who'd lost their pension funds

40:16.705 --> 40:18.666
{\an1}in one of Jack's high quality
investment portfolios,

40:18.749 --> 40:22.461
we kinda knew it was over.

40:22.545 --> 40:23.504
It's all right, though,

40:23.587 --> 40:25.381
{\an1}he'll be up for parole again
in six months.

40:25.464 --> 40:26.882
{\an1}Well, did you finish
that letter?

40:26.966 --> 40:28.467
{\an1}Yeah.

40:28.551 --> 40:29.635
{\an1}I guess we both know
what it's like

40:29.718 --> 40:32.513
{\an1}to have fathers who only care
about themselves.

40:32.596 --> 40:35.474
{\an1}By the way,
Brenda called last night.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.393
{\an1}She did?
How's she doing?

40:37.476 --> 40:38.144
They're having
a great time.

40:38.227 --> 40:41.480
She was going on
with this story,

40:41.564 --> 40:43.983
{\an1}something about eating brains,
I don't know.

40:44.066 --> 40:46.360
She seemed so far away.

40:46.443 --> 40:48.112
Well, she is far away.

40:48.195 --> 40:49.697
{\an1}When she asked about what
was going on here,

40:49.780 --> 40:51.532
{\an1}I didn't even tell her
about my dad.

40:51.615 --> 40:52.783
{\an1}Why not?

40:52.867 --> 40:56.036
{\an1}I didn't want
to bring her down.

40:56.120 --> 41:00.082
{\an1}Yeah, they're off in Paris
having the time of their lives

41:00.166 --> 41:01.709
and we're stuck here, miserable.

41:01.792 --> 41:07.089
To tell you the truth,
I'm not that miserable.

41:07.173 --> 41:09.633
{\an1}To tell you the truth,
neither am I.

41:16.265 --> 41:17.266
{\an1}Hi.

41:20.811 --> 41:24.190
I told him you were leaving.

41:24.273 --> 41:28.736
{\an1}I'd, uh, I'd like to talk to him
myself, if that's okay.

41:32.823 --> 41:35.534
{\an1}Cameron...

41:47.796 --> 41:51.091
{\an1}You and me,
we're friends.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.468
I like you.

42:09.818 --> 42:10.778
{\an1}It must have been tough
saying good-bye.

42:10.861 --> 42:14.448
I wasn't saying good-bye.

42:16.867 --> 42:19.828
{\an1}I told him
I changed my mind.

42:19.912 --> 42:22.790
{\an1}I decided I'm staying here
all summer.

42:22.873 --> 42:23.791
{\an1}You are?

42:23.874 --> 42:26.126
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

42:26.210 --> 42:28.254
Well, what happened?

42:28.337 --> 42:29.672
{\an1}Nothing.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.131
What about Jay?

42:31.215 --> 42:33.133
{\an1}What about, what about CNN,
what about Houston?

42:33.217 --> 42:35.594
Well, you hit the nail
on the head, Brandon.

42:35.678 --> 42:37.763
{\an1}I mean, how can I turn my back
on Cameron now?

42:37.846 --> 42:39.640
He needs me.

42:39.723 --> 42:44.812
More than Jay, or CNN, or God
knows, the Republican party.

42:44.895 --> 42:46.522
{\an1}So...

42:46.605 --> 42:49.358
{\an1}I had nothing to do with your
change of heart? Come on.

42:49.441 --> 42:52.653
{\an1}Of course not,
you conceited jerk.

42:52.736 --> 42:53.821
{\an1}(laughs)

42:53.904 --> 42:57.741
{\an1}You never cease to amaze me,
you know that?

42:57.825 --> 42:59.493
Thank you, sir.

42:59.576 --> 43:00.953
I do my best.

43:05.708 --> 43:06.875
{\an1}You're blowing a hell
of an opportunity,

43:06.959 --> 43:08.127
{\an1}you know that,
don't you?

43:08.210 --> 43:09.128
{\an1}No.

43:09.211 --> 43:09.962
{\an1}There'll be other
conventions.

43:10.045 --> 43:12.673
{\an1}I wasn't talking
about the convention.

43:12.756 --> 43:13.799
{\an1}I might still be here
when you come back.

43:13.882 --> 43:17.678
{\an1}I won't be,
not for long, anyway.

43:17.761 --> 43:19.013
{\an1}I mean, school starts
in September,

43:19.096 --> 43:22.182
{\an4}and Evanston, Illinois,
is a long way from
Beverly Hills.

43:22.266 --> 43:24.685
{\an4}Yeah, but there
are telephones,
airplanes.

43:24.768 --> 43:24.977
frequent flyer miles.

43:25.060 --> 43:28.314
{\an1}I mean,

43:28.397 --> 43:31.817
{\an1}if you're willing to try
a long-distance relationship.

43:31.900 --> 43:35.321
{\an1}I get the whole month
of December off,

43:35.404 --> 43:36.363
a week at Thanksgiving.

43:36.447 --> 43:39.867
Well, that's not so bad.

43:39.950 --> 43:43.245
{\an1}Yes, it is, but I'm glad
about one thing.

43:43.329 --> 43:44.538
{\an1}What?

43:44.621 --> 43:47.041
{\an1}That the reason you're staying
is Cameron Shaw,

43:47.124 --> 43:47.833
not Brandon Walsh.

43:47.916 --> 43:50.085
{\an1}That really
is the reason, right?

43:50.169 --> 43:52.046
{\an1}I mean, you wouldn't lie
to me, would you?

43:52.129 --> 43:52.713
Hey, I'm a Democrat, remember?

43:52.796 --> 43:54.840
We don't lie.

43:54.923 --> 43:55.758
Yeah, right.

43:55.841 --> 43:57.259
I guess there is something

43:57.343 --> 43:59.219
{\an1}to be said for the Democratic
party after all.

44:07.853 --> 44:10.105
Wake up, campers.

44:10.189 --> 44:11.940
{\an1}Andrea's having a major
tug-of-war down by the water

44:12.024 --> 44:13.609
and we need you.

44:13.692 --> 44:14.234
All right, come on.

44:14.318 --> 44:14.777
{\an1}Let's go get
some exercise.

44:14.860 --> 44:17.696
{\an1}Okay.

44:17.780 --> 44:20.741
(all shouting)

44:20.824 --> 44:22.618
{\an1}Come on! Let's go!
Keep pulling!

44:22.701 --> 44:23.744
{\an1}You're doing good!
Come on!

44:23.827 --> 44:25.829
{\an1}Come on, Annie!
Come on!

44:28.415 --> 44:30.542
{\an1}We're gonna win. Let's pull!
Let's pull!

44:30.626 --> 44:32.586
{\an1}Come on, you guys!
Let's pull!

44:35.839 --> 44:36.757
What is that?

44:36.840 --> 44:37.591
Are you pulling at all?

44:37.674 --> 44:39.593
{\an1}I think you need
to put some weight on.

44:39.676 --> 44:40.260
{\an1}Excuse me!

44:42.846 --> 44:46.100
{\an1}I'm sorry.
I got tangled up.

44:46.183 --> 44:46.934
Yeah, me, too.

44:47.017 --> 44:49.603
{\an1}STEVE:
Come on, lovebirds.

44:49.686 --> 44:50.813
Get off the rope.
