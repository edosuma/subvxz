00:02.162 --> 00:04.225
This town
was my home once.

00:04.226 --> 00:07.506
Our community is under attack.
They're declaring war on us.

00:07.507 --> 00:09.358
I die, all because
of your vow,

00:09.359 --> 00:10.759
always and forever.

00:10.760 --> 00:11.894
If you have come here
seeking revenge, don't...

00:11.895 --> 00:13.062
Oh, I'll have
my revenge.

00:13.063 --> 00:14.137
I'm Jackson.

00:14.138 --> 00:15.515
You're the wolf
who's been watching me.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.283
Jackson: Marcel had us
cursed by a witch.

00:17.284 --> 00:20.008
You and I are gonna
have a little chat.

00:20.009 --> 00:21.019
You're my family.

00:21.020 --> 00:22.371
Rebekah: My brother
expects my loyalty

00:22.372 --> 00:23.873
as he has
for 1,000 years.

00:23.874 --> 00:26.024
Marcel: Klaus will never
stop trying to control you.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.576
All his life,
there's only ever been

00:27.577 --> 00:29.211
one man he has
truly feared...

00:29.212 --> 00:30.296
My father Mikael.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.297
All we need
is a witch

00:31.298 --> 00:32.747
who can help us
find him.

00:32.749 --> 00:33.749
That's how I'm going
to have my revenge,

00:33.750 --> 00:34.867
by showing you
her betrayal.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.803
It was my idea
to summon Mikael.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.588
Uhhaah!

00:39.589 --> 00:42.474
Both of you, run as far
and as fast as you can.

witches, and dirty cops,

01:10.170 --> 01:14.290
all happy as clams
and drunk as stoats.

01:14.291 --> 01:16.542
You got to love
this city.

01:16.543 --> 01:18.260
To a new era
of collaboration

01:18.261 --> 01:20.704
in the face
of prohibition.

01:20.705 --> 01:22.765
To your docks,
their booze,

01:22.766 --> 01:25.518
and our theaters
to hide it under.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.504
You're welcome, boys.

01:33.192 --> 01:35.444
Now I shall have
to think of a way

01:35.445 --> 01:36.930
to thank you
personally

01:37.481 --> 01:41.018
in a manner befitting
a werewolf queen.

on the dance floor.

Who would have
thought it possible...

01:48.357 --> 01:50.277
The unification
of New Orleans?

01:51.961 --> 01:53.196
We did it, brother.

01:53.197 --> 01:55.247
Oh, certainly, we worked
together, Niklaus,

01:55.248 --> 01:57.117
but this vision...

01:58.918 --> 02:01.302
This was all you.

02:21.691 --> 02:22.690
Please.

02:24.109 --> 02:25.861
Why did you call me?

02:25.862 --> 02:27.145
Have you found a way
to help my uncle?

02:27.146 --> 02:28.864
I can try, but first,
I need your help.

02:28.865 --> 02:30.533
I don't have time
for games, Elijah.

02:30.534 --> 02:32.751
The hex on him is getting worse
by the day.

02:32.752 --> 02:33.786
My brother has
a mystical torture device

02:33.787 --> 02:35.287
buried in his chest,

02:35.288 --> 02:37.540
and the mother of his child
is inexplicably missing.

02:37.541 --> 02:39.758
So, I can assure you,
I have no time

02:39.759 --> 02:41.661
to play any games,
either.

02:43.579 --> 02:46.265
What do you
need me to do?

02:46.266 --> 02:49.018
Cami: The dagger the witch
gave me is inside of him?

02:49.019 --> 02:50.769
And every second
it remains

02:50.770 --> 02:53.689
causes Niklaus
untold suffering.

02:53.690 --> 02:54.940
Who stabbed him?

02:54.941 --> 02:56.892
I did,

02:56.893 --> 02:59.862
and now I intend
to remove it.

02:59.863 --> 03:01.973
You might want
to take a step back.

03:04.950 --> 03:06.103
Why am I here?

03:06.104 --> 03:08.353
Because of all the people
that could be here,

03:08.354 --> 03:10.982
you're probably the only one he
wouldn't immediately slaughter.

03:17.129 --> 03:18.573
Mm...

03:19.882 --> 03:22.325
Also, he speaks of you

03:22.326 --> 03:24.911
with what is
a rare degree...

03:24.912 --> 03:27.256
For him, at least...
Of respect.

03:27.257 --> 03:30.509
I can see you challenge him
to see himself and others

03:30.510 --> 03:32.511
in a new light...

03:33.004 --> 03:34.230
Ugh...

03:34.231 --> 03:35.880
Ahh...

03:35.881 --> 03:39.467
A wonderful skill that I shall
be counting on very shortly.

03:39.468 --> 03:45.101
You see, Niklaus
will be weak as he recovers.

03:46.725 --> 03:49.778
So watch over him and
feed him if you would

03:49.779 --> 03:53.115
but slowly, please,
and from your wrist.

03:53.116 --> 03:55.442
Don't you guys have bags
of blood in storage?

03:55.443 --> 03:58.254
We do, but your blood
is laced with vervain.

03:58.255 --> 04:00.574
So it will burn him.
He'll ingest it slower.

04:00.575 --> 04:02.741
Perhaps you could use
the time constructively,

04:03.242 --> 04:05.996
persuade him not to
murder his baby sister.

04:08.213 --> 04:10.950
Niklaus...

04:10.951 --> 04:13.686
It was not my desire
to bring you pain,

04:13.687 --> 04:16.939
but I will not
see you hurt Rebekah.

04:16.940 --> 04:18.632
Now, I fear Sabine

04:19.142 --> 04:20.976
may be making
a final move against us.

04:20.976 --> 04:24.387
I intend to find her
and to end this.

04:24.388 --> 04:26.433
Elijah...

04:32.021 --> 04:35.341
You will pay

04:35.342 --> 04:37.694
for this.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.116
Sabine: So what's
this, payback?

04:45.117 --> 04:46.552
Look. I'm sorry
I tricked you.

04:46.553 --> 04:47.886
I wasn't after you.

04:47.887 --> 04:50.005
Eve: What, and we were
just collateral damage?

04:50.006 --> 04:51.807
You almost burned her
and Jackson alive

04:51.808 --> 04:53.335
in that plantation fire.

04:53.893 --> 04:56.962
[Gunshot]
Careful, Sabine,

04:57.421 --> 04:59.732
or Celeste or whatever
you like to call yourself.

04:59.733 --> 05:03.676
Sudden moves make me
jumpy and homicidal.

05:03.677 --> 05:05.354
What, you're gonna
kill me, honey?

05:05.888 --> 05:07.406
No. I know better.

05:07.407 --> 05:09.351
See, I know
all about you.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.026
I know that you like
to off yourself

05:11.027 --> 05:12.911
and then jump into
other people's bodies.

05:12.912 --> 05:15.030
Well, that's not
gonna happen here.

05:15.031 --> 05:17.249
I know I can't kill you,
but try hexing me,

05:17.250 --> 05:19.918
and my friend Eve here
will kneecap you.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.781
Go for her, and then, well,
I'll really make it hurt.

05:24.039 --> 05:25.742
So what do you want?

05:25.743 --> 05:27.325
Back in the nineties,
you inhabited

05:27.326 --> 05:29.094
a witch named
Brynne Deveraux,

05:29.095 --> 05:31.630
remember?

05:31.631 --> 05:35.267
Marcel had her, you,

05:35.709 --> 05:37.369
put a curse on a lot
of werewolves

05:37.370 --> 05:39.471
so they'd only turn
human on a full moon.

05:39.472 --> 05:42.691
I see.

05:42.692 --> 05:44.276
Yes. That was me.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.362
Let me guess.
You want revenge.

05:46.363 --> 05:48.807
I want you
to undo the curse.

05:50.849 --> 05:53.143
Wow, things I never
thought I'd be doing...

05:53.144 --> 05:54.854
Feeding a vampire.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.771
My 16-year-old self
would think

05:56.772 --> 05:58.066
I'm really cool
right now.

06:02.861 --> 06:05.031
Mm.
Ah! Slow down.

06:05.531 --> 06:08.217
Ok. Doesn't
the vervain burn?

06:08.218 --> 06:11.162
Ah... ah...

06:11.688 --> 06:14.356
As you may have yet
to realize, Cami,

06:14.357 --> 06:17.959
the line between
what brings us pain

06:17.960 --> 06:20.145
and what sustains us
is far thinner

06:20.146 --> 06:23.048
than one imagines.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.483
You talking about
my blood or your need

06:24.484 --> 06:26.268
to hunt down the people
you love most?

06:26.269 --> 06:30.072
I'm too weak for one
of your talks right now.

06:30.073 --> 06:35.327
She's your sister.
How can you hate her?

06:35.328 --> 06:38.580
Because she has done
what no one else

06:38.581 --> 06:42.935
has managed to do to
me for 1,000 years...

06:42.936 --> 06:45.621

a pair.

this opportunity

07:11.147 --> 07:14.766
to draw attention
to two people

07:14.767 --> 07:19.397
who have been sneaking around
behind my back together.

07:24.660 --> 07:27.713
As we move into a new era,

07:27.714 --> 07:32.994
we require more
progressive attitudes to match.

07:33.452 --> 07:37.890
So... to my loving sister

07:37.891 --> 07:43.011
and my right-hand man
and best friend Marcel,

07:43.012 --> 07:46.549
may they find joy
in each other.

07:51.937 --> 07:54.072
Enough talk. Music.

Over the years,
I've thwarted your loves

08:05.001 --> 08:07.485
simply to protect you.

08:07.486 --> 08:09.421
I knew if we had
to run again,

08:09.422 --> 08:11.239
your heart
would be broken,

08:11.240 --> 08:14.994
but we don't have
to run anymore.

08:17.746 --> 08:19.874

my guard down

08:40.019 --> 08:42.604

to happiness,

08:42.605 --> 08:45.290
more fool, I.

08:45.291 --> 08:48.242
Klaus, voice-over: Turns out,
they'd already betrayed me...

08:51.713 --> 08:53.582
And brought to town
the one thing

08:53.583 --> 08:57.036
I'd been running from
for centuries...

09:00.664 --> 09:02.750

09:03.309 --> 09:04.335
Oh.

09:04.761 --> 09:08.131
Yes. Oh.

09:10.899 --> 09:14.344
So you're consumed by revenge
you'll never achieve.

09:14.345 --> 09:15.938
Elijah implied
Rebekah and Marcel

09:15.939 --> 09:17.689
could be anywhere
in the world by now.

09:17.690 --> 09:21.895
Oh, I'm not so sure
about that.

09:29.668 --> 09:31.569

we're sitting out here

09:31.570 --> 09:33.789

bold as brass?

09:33.790 --> 09:37.867
No. Ah, it feels
like heaven.

09:37.868 --> 09:39.661
You know, it's been
over 6 months

09:39.662 --> 09:42.957
since Genevieve summoned
my father, and nothing.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.542
Her spell
must have failed.

09:44.708 --> 09:48.796
Hey, if so,
we dodged a bullet.

09:52.140 --> 09:53.358
Right.

09:53.359 --> 09:54.759
I am off to speak

09:54.760 --> 09:56.761
at the women's temperance
society meeting

09:56.762 --> 09:58.096
to make sure the wives
of this city

09:58.097 --> 10:00.282
urge their husbands
not to drink.

10:00.283 --> 10:02.618
Aren't you all in
the booze biz now?

10:02.619 --> 10:05.270
Yes, but the more
one tells you

10:05.271 --> 10:08.707
you can't have something,
the more you crave it

10:08.708 --> 10:11.743
at all costs.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.210
Ha ha ha!

10:28.110 --> 10:30.929
He'll chase us
to the ends of the earth,

10:30.930 --> 10:34.349
and he'll find us.

10:34.350 --> 10:37.011
No one can hide
forever,

10:37.012 --> 10:39.971
especially not from
an angry Mikaelson.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.190
Then we go through
with the plan.

10:42.191 --> 10:44.359
There's only one way
that we'll truly be able

10:44.360 --> 10:47.145
to hide from Klaus
forever.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.814
They'll need
a cloaking spell,

10:49.815 --> 10:52.017
and for that,
they'll need a witch.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.820
Davina
is our one shot.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.354
If we go back
and get her...

10:55.355 --> 10:56.455
It's a suicide
mission.

10:56.456 --> 10:57.673
It's our only hope.

10:57.674 --> 10:59.341
We resurrect her,
take her with us,

10:59.342 --> 11:00.342
and get out of town.

11:00.343 --> 11:01.376
Then she can hide us
from Klaus

11:01.377 --> 11:02.827
so he'll never
find us.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.846
We don't even know the right witch
to kill to bring her back.

11:04.847 --> 11:06.124
Then we'll
kill them all.

11:06.549 --> 11:08.100
Just kill the 3 witches
that brought

11:08.101 --> 11:10.502
the mighty Klaus Mikaelson
to his knees, no big deal.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.187

to spend eternity

11:12.188 --> 11:13.505

your shoulder,

11:13.506 --> 11:15.381
there's only one thing
that we can do.

11:15.382 --> 11:18.928
There's only one
place they can go...

11:25.117 --> 11:27.068

11:41.314 --> 11:43.448
When order is restored,

11:43.449 --> 11:45.517
your kind won't
be allowed in here.

11:45.518 --> 11:48.124
Well, fortunately, that
day has not yet come.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.688
I need to find
Sabine.

11:49.689 --> 11:50.855
I believe she's
taken someone

very important
to me.

11:52.524 --> 11:55.760
And you thought
I'd help you?

11:55.761 --> 11:58.013
Sabine is one of us,

11:58.014 --> 11:59.881
committed to the rise
of the witches.

11:59.882 --> 12:01.283
The only thing Sabine
is committed to

of my family.

And that would be
a bad thing why?

12:04.887 --> 12:06.059
Like your mother,

12:06.555 --> 12:08.423
my mother
was also a witch,

12:08.424 --> 12:09.591
a very
powerful witch.

12:09.592 --> 12:11.259
In fact, because
of my family,

12:11.260 --> 12:14.732
her power now flows
through your veins.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.231
Now, once Sabine
manipulates

12:16.232 --> 12:17.548
those around her,
she will do

12:17.549 --> 12:18.817
what she has
always done.

12:18.818 --> 12:20.268
She will jump
into another body

12:20.269 --> 12:21.903
and disappear,

12:21.904 --> 12:24.951
leaving your witches
powerless.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.557
No. She has
the faith.

12:26.558 --> 12:28.443
She will see
our power restored.

12:28.444 --> 12:31.082
There's a way of
guaranteeing this.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.447
I'll also secure
the safety

12:32.448 --> 12:34.796
of yourself
and your kind.

12:34.797 --> 12:38.464
Here. This is from
my mother's grimoire.

12:38.465 --> 12:39.871
Celeste used
a similar spell

12:39.872 --> 12:41.923
to body jump.

12:41.924 --> 12:43.425
If what Sabine says
is true,

12:43.426 --> 12:44.793
when she sacrifices
herself,

12:44.794 --> 12:46.211
all of her power
will flow

12:46.212 --> 12:47.412
back into the earth.

12:47.413 --> 12:50.081
However,
if she has lied

12:50.082 --> 12:52.772
and tries to take
another body,

12:53.252 --> 12:55.270
this spell
will deliver her

12:55.271 --> 12:57.443
to a very different
destination.

12:58.974 --> 13:03.408
Now please
locate Sabine.

13:05.330 --> 13:06.994
Rebekah:
Papa Tunde is dead.

13:06.995 --> 13:08.450
That leaves Sabine,

13:08.451 --> 13:09.534
Bastianna,
and Genevieve.

13:09.535 --> 13:10.785
We want to kill
them all,

13:10.786 --> 13:12.170
and as soon
as Davina rises,

13:12.171 --> 13:13.488
we take her with us.

13:13.489 --> 13:15.169
Look. We have
one shot at this,

13:15.170 --> 13:17.492
and I know our
chances of success

13:17.493 --> 13:20.091
are sweet bugger all,
but we've got to do it.

13:20.496 --> 13:23.548
So please, one stray
dog to another,

13:23.549 --> 13:25.138
help us.

13:25.617 --> 13:27.452
Not many go up against
those odds

13:27.453 --> 13:30.621
and live to tell
the story.

13:30.622 --> 13:32.556
Have you?

13:34.559 --> 13:36.274
I'm still standing
here, aren't I?

13:38.813 --> 13:41.028
I've gone up against
the worst of them all.

13:47.405 --> 13:49.744
You're a lucky man.

13:49.745 --> 13:52.577
Men search the world over
for a woman like her.

13:52.578 --> 13:54.913
Well, she's taken,
friend.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.115
Oh, I can see that.

13:57.116 --> 13:58.750
It's just that she
reminds me so much

13:58.751 --> 14:01.036
of my departed wife
as a girl.

14:01.037 --> 14:02.704
See, I've been traveling
for such a long time

14:02.705 --> 14:05.707
that it's a blessing
to see a familiar soul

14:05.708 --> 14:08.043
so far from home.

14:08.044 --> 14:11.142
I'm sorry
for your loss.

14:11.663 --> 14:14.854
Here's to old faces
in new places.

14:19.020 --> 14:21.473
I've been in New Orleans
for a day,

14:21.474 --> 14:23.224
and I find it to be
quite surprising.

14:23.225 --> 14:26.194
Had I known of its charm
and fascinating denizens,

14:26.195 --> 14:28.947
I would have come
ages ago.

14:28.948 --> 14:30.515
Don't supposed
I have to thank you

14:30.516 --> 14:33.581
for extending
this invitation.

14:35.653 --> 14:36.905
Who are

14:36.906 --> 14:40.291
oh, you're
a smart man.

14:40.292 --> 14:42.840
I think you know.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.900
I'm an intelligent
man myself,

14:48.901 --> 14:50.890
so have a seat.

14:52.036 --> 14:54.435
Let me tell you
what I learned

14:54.436 --> 14:58.397
about you this afternoon,
Marcel Gerard.

14:58.877 --> 15:01.816
You chafe under the control
of my son Niklaus

15:01.817 --> 15:04.799
and would do just about
anything to get rid if him,

15:04.800 --> 15:07.435
even call the one man
on this earth

15:07.436 --> 15:09.240
who hates him
more than you do,

15:09.241 --> 15:11.473
but I couldn't understand
what you hoped to gain...

15:11.474 --> 15:13.037
Rule of this city?

15:13.038 --> 15:16.327
Well, as I said,
New Orleans has its charms,

15:16.328 --> 15:19.114
but to call me...

15:19.668 --> 15:22.044
The one they call
the destroyer,

15:22.045 --> 15:24.463
the one who's
burnt cities

15:24.464 --> 15:26.254
far more charming
to the ground

15:26.255 --> 15:28.219
in pursuit
of his children...

15:28.791 --> 15:30.221
But now I see.

15:30.742 --> 15:34.345
You did it for love,
the love of my daughter.

15:34.346 --> 15:36.581
Don't you dare
touch her.

15:36.582 --> 15:39.934
Mm, so I'm going
to make you a promise.

15:39.935 --> 15:41.636
I won't hurt Rebekah...

15:41.637 --> 15:44.105
Truth be told, she was
always my favorite...

15:44.106 --> 15:47.029
And this city,
you can have it,

15:47.030 --> 15:50.695
but first,
you must tell me

15:50.696 --> 15:53.781
where to find my son.

15:53.782 --> 15:55.371
Uh...

15:55.372 --> 15:58.036
You're
still weak.

15:58.037 --> 16:01.878
I'm still hungry.

16:05.610 --> 16:07.579
There's a fresh
blood supply

16:07.580 --> 16:08.779
in the kitchen.

16:08.780 --> 16:10.131
You won't make it
that far.

16:10.132 --> 16:12.261
So be a good little boy
and get back into bed.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.835
If I had a quid
for every time

16:13.836 --> 16:15.637
a woman has tried
that line on me...

16:16.058 --> 16:17.805
You'd have, like,
no money.

16:17.806 --> 16:19.841
I beg to differ.

16:19.842 --> 16:21.476
Some women
actually find me

16:21.477 --> 16:23.178
quite charming.

16:23.179 --> 16:25.929
Uh! Ha ha ha!

16:28.349 --> 16:32.020
Ha ha ha!

16:32.021 --> 16:34.410
Sleeping with
the enemy, I see.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.412
I'm the ally now,
darling.

16:36.825 --> 16:38.743
Well, indeed.

16:38.744 --> 16:41.499
Klaus: Oh, and as a
gesture of goodwill

16:41.500 --> 16:43.198
from our old enemy,

16:43.199 --> 16:44.916
tickets to
tonight's opera...

16:44.917 --> 16:46.334
"Les huguenots."

16:46.335 --> 16:48.382
They have a soprano
to die for.

16:48.383 --> 16:51.005
I'll introduce you
if you promise not to eat her.

16:51.426 --> 16:53.177
Oh, Lana,

16:53.178 --> 16:55.710
a good soprano
is never dinner.

16:56.139 --> 16:58.517
Tell Rebekah
to bring Marcel.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.698
Feel free
to tell her now,

17:00.699 --> 17:02.667
big brother.

17:02.668 --> 17:04.301
I have some business
I need to discuss

17:04.303 --> 17:06.136
with our new ally.

17:07.689 --> 17:11.196
Why am I not surprised
you like opera?

17:12.609 --> 17:14.945
I always had a
particular soft spot

17:14.946 --> 17:16.897
for "les huguenots."

17:16.898 --> 17:19.200
I like the story.

17:19.201 --> 17:22.686
It was a tale
of forbidden love,

17:22.688 --> 17:26.574
a "Romeo and Juliet"
of sorts.

17:26.575 --> 17:30.295
On the day
they are to marry,

17:30.296 --> 17:32.297
family and
long-festering hatred

17:32.298 --> 17:34.051
intervene.

17:34.052 --> 17:35.533
Thousands are massacred.

17:35.534 --> 17:37.919
A father even kills
his own child

17:37.920 --> 17:40.555
in the final act.

17:40.556 --> 17:44.647
I can almost
appreciate the irony.

17:50.064 --> 17:52.149
Here.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.903
It's herbs
ground into paste.

17:55.904 --> 17:58.072
It'll act as a conduit
for the spell.

17:58.073 --> 17:59.073
On the next
full moon,

17:59.074 --> 18:00.391
your people
become human.

18:00.392 --> 18:02.454
Feed it to them, the
curse will be broken.

18:02.455 --> 18:04.162
Great way to poison us
all at once.

18:04.163 --> 18:05.780
Look. I know you
have no reason

18:05.781 --> 18:08.583
to trust me,
but, Hayley,

18:08.584 --> 18:11.085
I actually like you.

18:11.086 --> 18:13.338
I was you,
caring for Elijah

18:13.339 --> 18:15.089
when he cared more
for his brother,

18:15.090 --> 18:16.574
and I ended up dead.

18:16.575 --> 18:18.556
So did a lot
of others.

18:18.961 --> 18:20.595
This, call it a chance
for me to give you

18:20.596 --> 18:22.630
what I was too in love
to give myself.

18:22.631 --> 18:24.182
It's a chance
to free yourself

18:24.183 --> 18:25.550
from The Originals.

18:25.551 --> 18:27.313
You believe her?

18:27.314 --> 18:29.604
[Growls]

18:29.605 --> 18:32.923
Elijah: Whatever she's
promised you, it's a lie.

18:32.924 --> 18:34.609
Elijah, it's ok.
I'm ok.

18:35.071 --> 18:36.697
She cannot
be trusted.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.429
She's the only one
that can help my pack.

18:38.430 --> 18:39.847
Do you have any idea
what she has done

18:39.848 --> 18:41.316
to our family?

18:41.317 --> 18:43.568
I know you want revenge,
and come the next full moon,

18:43.569 --> 18:46.270
when I'm sure her cure
works, she's all yours.

18:46.271 --> 18:48.773
Are you suggesting
that we hold her,

18:48.774 --> 18:52.943
her, captive
for an entire month?

18:52.944 --> 18:54.508
It would take
an army.

18:54.509 --> 18:56.634
And I've got one.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.719
[Howls]

18:58.720 --> 19:01.084
[Distant howling]

19:02.620 --> 19:05.811
So help me
or get out of my way.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.018
You tricked her.

19:20.019 --> 19:21.753
It's no trick.

19:21.754 --> 19:24.022
You're holding the cure for
Hayley's clan in your hand.

19:24.023 --> 19:26.191
If her wolves take that elixir,
the curse is no more.

19:26.192 --> 19:27.414
They're free.

19:27.415 --> 19:29.477
You condemned her people
to decades of agony,

19:29.478 --> 19:31.146
and now you just
break the curse

19:31.147 --> 19:32.397
without so much
as a whimper.

19:32.398 --> 19:34.766
Why?

19:34.767 --> 19:37.869
Because it's the best thing
I could do for her

19:37.870 --> 19:39.788
and it's the worst
possible thing

19:39.789 --> 19:41.706
I could do to you.

19:41.707 --> 19:43.158
What are you saying?

19:43.159 --> 19:44.376
That, no matter
what happens now,

19:44.377 --> 19:45.627
you've lost her.

19:45.628 --> 19:47.712
You destroy that jar,
you kill me,

19:47.713 --> 19:48.964
Hayley will hate you

19:48.965 --> 19:51.666
for snatching
her family from her.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.899
Now, if you
give her the jar,

19:53.900 --> 19:55.337
we both know that
she'll leave you

19:55.338 --> 19:57.138
in the end to be
with them,

19:57.139 --> 19:58.974
and I know that as long
as she's alive

19:58.975 --> 20:01.226
and happy and
fulfilled in ways

20:01.227 --> 20:04.479
that you can't
even imagine,

20:04.480 --> 20:06.705
then I get
my revenge.

20:07.233 --> 20:08.800
So you decide...
Give her everything

20:08.801 --> 20:10.518
she ever wanted
and lose her

20:10.519 --> 20:15.422
or deny it, see
what happens then.

20:18.193 --> 20:21.846
Where's the third one...
Sabine?

20:21.847 --> 20:23.214
I asked to meet
with all 3 of you.

20:23.215 --> 20:24.683
Our meeting you at all
is a courtesy

20:24.684 --> 20:26.835
for your being a friend
to witches in the past,

20:26.836 --> 20:29.393
but courtesy
has its limits.

20:29.394 --> 20:32.007
Now, you said you
had information

20:32.008 --> 20:33.482
of interest to us.

20:34.774 --> 20:36.819
Rebekah and Marcel
are back.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.575
They came for Davina,
and they think

20:38.576 --> 20:41.278
that they can get her if
they kill all 3 of you.

20:41.279 --> 20:43.163
Now look.

20:43.164 --> 20:45.115
I can lead you
straight to them,

20:45.116 --> 20:47.244
but there's something
I want in return.

20:47.245 --> 20:49.832
And what's that?

20:52.400 --> 20:54.376
Your life.

20:54.377 --> 20:56.821
[Chanting]

21:09.000 --> 21:10.501
[Chanting]

21:13.004 --> 21:16.317
Follow me, and I'll turn
you both into ash.

21:19.044 --> 21:21.162
Forget her.
We'll get her later.

21:21.163 --> 21:23.381
Marcel, all we have is
the element of surprise,

21:23.382 --> 21:25.050
and we have lost it.

21:25.051 --> 21:26.351
If we don't
leave now,

21:26.352 --> 21:27.686
there will be
no one to save us.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.554
I already
failed Davina once.

21:29.555 --> 21:31.415
I'm not leaving
her behind.

21:37.979 --> 21:40.649
Not sure that helps.

21:40.650 --> 21:42.635
Not sure it doesn't.

21:43.069 --> 21:46.538
You want to self-medicate
your self-pity, fine.

21:46.539 --> 21:49.014
Better scotch than my blood,
no matter what Elijah says.

21:49.015 --> 21:51.266
Don't speak to me
of Elijah.

21:51.267 --> 21:53.879
He loves you.
Yes.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.430
He does,
and he proves it

21:55.431 --> 21:58.016
time and again,
even when my father

21:58.017 --> 22:00.184
enlisted him
to kill me.

22:03.188 --> 22:05.607
"Uguenots".

22:05.608 --> 22:08.692
Saw it in venice,
marvelous production.

22:09.844 --> 22:12.287
You.
It's all right, son.

22:12.288 --> 22:13.791
I just want to talk.

22:14.233 --> 22:17.018
You mercilessly
hunt us for centuries.

22:17.019 --> 22:18.537
You laid waste
to half of Europe.

22:18.538 --> 22:22.297
Now you simply
wish to talk?

22:22.298 --> 22:24.292
It was your bastard
brother I hunted,

22:24.293 --> 22:27.177
not you, never you.

22:27.178 --> 22:28.797
You're my blood,

22:28.798 --> 22:30.933
one that I'd be
proud to call son.

22:31.367 --> 22:33.600
So I came here
to give you a chance

22:33.601 --> 22:37.722
to help me put down
that whelp for good.

22:37.723 --> 22:39.692
Waah! Aah!

22:44.262 --> 22:47.432
Do you really
not know me?

22:47.866 --> 22:49.734
Do you think
I could or would

22:49.735 --> 22:52.720
believe in anything
that you say?

22:52.721 --> 22:54.990
If you honestly believe
that I would betray

22:54.991 --> 22:59.160
my own brother
for you,

22:59.161 --> 23:03.297
you're a fool
without equal.

23:03.298 --> 23:05.900
I'll forgive you your
sentimental affections

23:05.901 --> 23:09.052
for the thing
you call brother,

23:09.053 --> 23:12.907
but you need to realize,
as I did when I learned

23:12.908 --> 23:17.128
his mother had lain
with a beast to beget him,

23:17.129 --> 23:21.349
Niklaus
is an abomination.

23:21.350 --> 23:24.102
You do not talk
to abominations.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.805
You do not reason with them.

23:26.806 --> 23:32.536
Do not try to change them.
You erase them.

23:32.945 --> 23:36.781
So, yes, I am asking you

23:36.782 --> 23:39.418
to help me kill
your brother.

23:41.936 --> 23:43.905
You keep saying kill,
but you're immortal.

23:43.906 --> 23:45.206
You can't be killed.

23:45.207 --> 23:47.292
Oh, but we can, luv,

23:47.293 --> 23:48.627
and my father
was the only one

23:48.628 --> 23:50.778
with the means
to do it...

23:50.779 --> 23:54.132
A white oak stake
fashioned by my father

23:54.133 --> 23:55.617
to take from us
the very thing

23:55.618 --> 23:57.502
he forced
upon us all...

23:57.503 --> 24:00.504
Our immortality.

24:05.977 --> 24:09.230
Stand with me

24:09.231 --> 24:11.232
or fall with him.

24:11.233 --> 24:12.618
Choose, son.

24:19.574 --> 24:23.862
I will always...

24:23.863 --> 24:25.997
Choose him.

24:25.998 --> 24:28.008
Fine.

24:32.987 --> 24:35.206
Klaus, voice-over: Elijah
has always carried guilt

24:35.207 --> 24:38.760
for that night for not
stopping our father.

24:38.761 --> 24:40.978
I told him not
to blame himself.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.497
When your father
wants to kill you,

24:42.498 --> 24:45.050
he wants
to kill you,

24:45.051 --> 24:48.520
nothing you can do
about it.

24:48.521 --> 24:53.191
[Cell phone vibrates]

24:53.192 --> 24:55.360
Oh, I hate to be
a know-it-all.

24:55.361 --> 24:56.895
My sister
and her lover

24:56.896 --> 24:58.455
have been spotted
in town.

24:58.898 --> 25:01.458
So story time endeth
here, I'm afraid.

25:06.488 --> 25:07.798
What is that?

25:08.290 --> 25:12.136
A white oak stake,
my own special version,

25:12.661 --> 25:14.245
and, unlike my father's,

25:14.246 --> 25:17.349
this one
cannot be destroyed.

25:29.377 --> 25:31.195
What are you doing?

25:31.196 --> 25:33.798
Well, if you
have to ask,

25:33.799 --> 25:36.367
you obviously haven't
been paying attention.

25:36.909 --> 25:38.252
I'm going to kill
my sister,

25:38.253 --> 25:39.721
but first, I needed
some sustenance

25:39.722 --> 25:41.472
with a little less
vervain in it,

25:41.473 --> 25:42.664
no offense.

25:42.665 --> 25:44.875
When Davina showed me
all you did to me,

25:44.876 --> 25:47.463
all you took from me,
I wanted to kill you.

25:47.464 --> 25:49.230
I even thought about
burying that blade in you

25:49.231 --> 25:51.065
like the witches
asked me to, but I didn't.

25:51.066 --> 25:52.266
I stopped. I thought.

25:52.842 --> 25:54.435
I weighed the good
I see in you

25:54.436 --> 25:56.738
versus the horrible things
I know you've done,

25:56.739 --> 25:58.439
and I realized
if I hurt you,

25:58.440 --> 26:00.391
I'd be filled
with a terrible regret.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.743
You will, too,
if you hurt your sister,

26:01.744 --> 26:03.244
your sister, Klaus.

26:03.245 --> 26:04.612
As a person who has
lost a sibling,

26:04.613 --> 26:07.498
who has felt that pain,
you won't survive

26:07.499 --> 26:08.833
if you're the one
who kills her.

26:08.834 --> 26:10.001
I'll tell you
what I almost

26:10.002 --> 26:11.502
didn't survive,
luv...

26:11.503 --> 26:13.805
My sister bringing
the most vile creature

26:13.806 --> 26:15.123
ever to have
walked the earth

26:15.124 --> 26:16.340
down upon me.

26:16.341 --> 26:18.843
Yes, your father,
but by hunting Rebekah

26:18.844 --> 26:20.461
and Marcel down
to the ends of the earth,

26:20.462 --> 26:24.374
by terrorizing them the way
you yourself were terrorized...

26:24.375 --> 26:27.135
Don't become
your father.

26:27.136 --> 26:29.520
I've been called
every shade of monster,

26:29.521 --> 26:31.105
but that's new.

26:31.106 --> 26:32.807
My father?

26:32.808 --> 26:34.759
Mikael
was the monster

26:34.760 --> 26:37.195
monsters
were afraid of.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.722
Come.
Let me show you.

26:45.432 --> 26:47.467
You came back.

26:47.468 --> 26:48.690
I'll always
come back.

26:50.270 --> 26:53.111
Take it.

26:55.158 --> 26:56.323
It will work.

27:08.588 --> 27:11.838
Eve and I will round up as many
of our people as we can.

27:12.343 --> 27:16.468
Come full moon, I can
finally free my family.

27:27.440 --> 27:28.564
Hayley...

27:41.454 --> 27:43.373
I wonder if they
have any idea

27:43.374 --> 27:44.955
how lucky they are
to have you.

27:49.829 --> 27:51.044
Mm.

28:01.975 --> 28:05.557
That was touching,

28:05.558 --> 28:08.477
such a chaste,
little kiss.

28:08.478 --> 28:11.401
The Elijah I knew
was never so meek.

28:11.402 --> 28:15.655
Well, the Celeste I knew
was never so cruel.

28:15.656 --> 28:17.273
What is it that you want?
What's your endgame?

28:17.274 --> 28:20.076
Oh, this game
never ends, Elijah.

28:20.077 --> 28:22.157
We're both immortal,
you know.

28:22.158 --> 28:24.197
Then what's the point
if you can't possibly win?

28:24.198 --> 28:26.416
But I have.

28:26.417 --> 28:28.451
You just
lost the girl,

28:28.452 --> 28:30.003
the girl you never
made a move on

28:30.004 --> 28:31.588
because you were
so desperate

28:31.589 --> 28:33.673
to save your family,

28:33.674 --> 28:35.458
and now your family
lies in ruins.

28:35.459 --> 28:38.011
My family, despite
all that you have done,

28:38.012 --> 28:39.633
will heal in time.

28:39.634 --> 28:41.631
If you had
the time, maybe,

28:41.632 --> 28:43.433
but you really think
Rebekah ran far

28:43.434 --> 28:46.252
and fast from here?
I bet she didn't.

28:46.253 --> 28:48.477
She's long gone.
Is she?

28:50.106 --> 28:53.480
She's with Marcel.

28:53.481 --> 28:55.111
Now, Marcel
loves Davina.

28:55.112 --> 28:56.980
Davina is dead, but
she could come back

28:56.981 --> 28:58.695
under the right
circumstances.

28:58.696 --> 29:00.316
You wouldn't dare.

29:00.317 --> 29:01.768
If you hadn't been
so worried about Hayley,

29:01.769 --> 29:03.653
you might have
figured it out sooner,

29:03.654 --> 29:04.954
but you know who did
have the time

29:04.955 --> 29:06.239
to think about it?

29:06.240 --> 29:08.491
Your brother.

29:08.492 --> 29:11.161
I wonder
what he'll do.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.418
Heh. Do it.

29:19.052 --> 29:21.221
You know
your city's history,

29:21.222 --> 29:23.123
that night in 1919
when the opera house

29:23.124 --> 29:25.222
burned down
on this very spot?

29:25.223 --> 29:27.641
That was my father
at his worst.

29:33.183 --> 29:36.569
Klaus: Well, this is
off to a bad start.

29:36.570 --> 29:38.571
Your first big date
together in public

29:38.572 --> 29:39.906
after I gave you
my blessing,

29:39.907 --> 29:41.891
and he stood you up.

29:41.892 --> 29:43.993
Something must
have delayed him.

29:43.994 --> 29:45.695
Or, now that
your elicit affair

29:45.696 --> 29:47.146
is out in the open,
he finds

29:47.147 --> 29:49.365
the whole relationship
a tad lackluster

29:49.366 --> 29:51.367
and has run off to
havana with a showgirl.

29:51.368 --> 29:54.668
Don't be such a toerag.
I'm going to check the lobby.

29:54.669 --> 29:56.756
See if you can't
find our brother

29:56.757 --> 29:58.208
while you're there.

29:58.209 --> 30:04.208
The curtain
is about to go up.

30:12.172 --> 30:17.393
I would advise against
trying to flee, boy.

30:17.394 --> 30:19.691
I can drive this
into your heart

30:19.692 --> 30:21.498
before you
can even think

30:21.499 --> 30:24.184
of getting
to your feet,

30:24.185 --> 30:28.368
and I don't want you
to die... yet.

30:28.369 --> 30:30.704
Father...
"Father"? Ha ha!

30:30.705 --> 30:32.525
Still clinging
to that word

30:32.526 --> 30:33.707
after all
these years,

30:33.708 --> 30:38.581
a bastard desperate
for a daddy?

30:38.582 --> 30:40.383
I wonder if your
real father would be

30:40.384 --> 30:43.035
as embarrassed
as I was of you

30:43.036 --> 30:45.505
before I discovered
you were not mine.

30:45.506 --> 30:48.892
Most likely.

30:48.893 --> 30:52.684
Oh, oh. Uh-uh.
Easy now, boy.

30:54.397 --> 30:56.599
Don't worry.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.985
Death will come,
but we need to have

30:58.986 --> 31:01.905
a little chat
before you

31:01.906 --> 31:04.157
shuffle off
your immortal coil.

31:04.158 --> 31:05.775
Any words we have
for each other

31:05.776 --> 31:08.244
have been spoken
long ago,

31:08.245 --> 31:11.247
but know this.

31:11.248 --> 31:14.417
I am no longer
the animal

31:14.418 --> 31:17.167
begging for scraps
of your affection.

31:17.168 --> 31:22.506
I will die knowing
my hatred for you was just.

31:22.910 --> 31:26.718
I will fall proud of all
I have achieved here.

31:27.264 --> 31:31.751
So... Mikael...

31:31.752 --> 31:34.804
If you're going
to kill me,

31:34.805 --> 31:36.906
then get on with it.

31:37.311 --> 31:39.142
Au contraire,
Niklaus.

31:39.143 --> 31:41.523
Some things
remain unsaid.

31:41.524 --> 31:42.862
For instance,
you were right

31:42.863 --> 31:44.280
to be proud of your
achievement here.

31:44.281 --> 31:47.650
As I walked the streets,
your name was spoken of

31:47.651 --> 31:49.986
in reverent tones
by the city's finest.

31:49.987 --> 31:52.956
So after I kill you,

31:52.957 --> 31:54.958
I will remain here
in New Orleans

31:54.959 --> 31:58.411
until every last person
who remembers you

31:58.412 --> 31:59.543
is dead.

31:59.947 --> 32:02.298
The deeds
of the mighty Klaus

32:02.837 --> 32:04.798
will be remembered
by no one...

32:07.253 --> 32:11.341
And you, boy,

32:11.342 --> 32:14.761
will simply
never have existed.

[Orchestra tuning]

32:19.766 --> 32:23.303
Ah. The grand show.

32:23.304 --> 32:25.321
Oh, I made
some alterations

32:25.322 --> 32:26.906
in your honor.

32:27.445 --> 32:29.281
You'll love it.

32:36.699 --> 32:38.582
Klaus, voice-over:
And what a show it was.

32:42.672 --> 32:46.709
Mikael compelled the audience
to watch it all,

32:47.131 --> 32:52.181
applaud as if it were
the drollest of comedies

32:52.182 --> 32:53.850
and then to leave
celebrating

32:53.851 --> 32:56.014
a terrific night
at the opera.

32:56.015 --> 32:59.439
I tried to save
Marcel.

32:59.440 --> 33:00.639
[Spike clatters]

33:02.692 --> 33:05.899
My father
had other ideas.

to intervene.

33:10.362 --> 33:11.946
Yaah!

33:11.947 --> 33:13.703
[Applause]

33:13.704 --> 33:15.038
All these years,
I actually believed

33:15.039 --> 33:16.743
she was trying
to save me...

33:16.744 --> 33:18.791
Klaus: Agh!

33:18.792 --> 33:21.994
[Laughter and applause]

33:26.632 --> 33:28.797
But then big brother
swooped in...

33:28.798 --> 33:30.853
There's no
helping Marcel.

33:30.854 --> 33:32.759
Just when we thought
all was lost.

33:32.760 --> 33:35.091
We must run.

33:35.092 --> 33:37.098
Klaus, voice-over:
And so I ran,

33:37.644 --> 33:38.761
beaten like the dog

33:38.762 --> 33:41.431

believed me to be...

33:41.432 --> 33:42.646
Agh!

Klaus, voice-over:
And as we fled for our lives,

he burnt it all to the ground
and with it, he assumed, Marcel.

34:00.116 --> 34:04.670
I lived, but all
that we had built died,

34:04.671 --> 34:09.045
as did the last shred
of me that felt human.

34:09.045 --> 34:12.795
That is what my father
took from me that night.

34:12.795 --> 34:15.467
I assure you,
Camille,

34:15.469 --> 34:17.632
I will not terrorize
my sister and her lover

34:17.634 --> 34:18.632
for centuries.

34:19.103 --> 34:22.855
Nor will I humiliate and
torment or dehumanize them.

34:22.856 --> 34:24.639
No, none of that.

34:24.641 --> 34:28.226
I will simply
and quickly end them.

34:28.228 --> 34:31.012
Klaus, wait.

34:39.061 --> 34:43.097
Now, you didn't have
to bite me to get me here.

34:44.516 --> 34:47.418
I wanted front-row seats
to this show.

34:47.904 --> 34:50.155
And what show
would that be?

34:50.156 --> 34:52.641

34:52.641 --> 34:54.493
your "always
and forever" pact

34:54.494 --> 34:57.385
come crashing down
around you.

34:57.386 --> 35:01.083
It's a myth, Elijah,
a myth I died for.

35:01.084 --> 35:05.153
And yet here
you stand alive...

35:05.154 --> 35:07.539
For now.

35:07.540 --> 35:08.857
Is that a threat?

another pretty,

for me to jump into.

35:14.153 --> 35:17.132
From now on,
every time you feel

35:17.133 --> 35:18.634
a connection to a woman,
you'll be forced

35:18.635 --> 35:20.452
to wonder
if it's me.

35:20.453 --> 35:21.995
You'll trust no one

35:21.996 --> 35:26.107
and spend the rest
of eternity alone.

35:29.344 --> 35:32.013
Ha ha ha!

35:32.014 --> 35:33.214
Ha ha ha!

35:33.215 --> 35:35.233
I'm afraid
you're trapped.

35:35.234 --> 35:36.233
Boundary spell.

35:36.686 --> 35:38.453
The Originals can enter,
but they can't leave.

35:38.454 --> 35:40.188
You wouldn't.

35:40.189 --> 35:43.099
I would, and I did.

35:54.386 --> 35:58.389
I got you, D.
I got you.

36:12.604 --> 36:15.607
It's a trap.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.392
Run. Get Davina
out of here.

36:17.393 --> 36:18.944
I'm not leaving
you behind.

36:18.945 --> 36:20.551
You must.

36:20.552 --> 36:22.748
I will not
leave you behind.

36:22.749 --> 36:24.889
I swear I will
join you.

36:24.890 --> 36:27.435
Go. Get Davina
someplace safe.

36:34.042 --> 36:37.429
Sabine: Don't worry.
It's a lunar spell.

36:37.430 --> 36:39.414
You'll be free by
the next moonrise.

36:39.415 --> 36:42.434
My guess is,

36:42.435 --> 36:45.120
your sister won't
last that long.

36:51.610 --> 36:54.780
Ah, while
this body has been

36:54.781 --> 36:57.232
a hell of a lot of fun,
I do think it's time

36:57.233 --> 37:00.468
I find someone else
to play in, don't you?

37:01.936 --> 37:02.935
[Coughing]

37:10.212 --> 37:11.604
[Coughing stops]

37:19.971 --> 37:23.116
You were right.

37:35.303 --> 37:37.422
[Speaking
foreign language]

37:46.181 --> 37:47.223
[Gasps]

37:57.459 --> 38:01.413
Hello, Celeste.

38:01.414 --> 38:02.614
How is this
possible?

38:03.082 --> 38:05.531
Monique Deveraux and I
had a little wager

38:05.532 --> 38:07.744
regarding your ability
to keep a promise.

38:09.703 --> 38:10.997
It appears I won.

38:12.724 --> 38:16.228
You were so consumed
with my downfall,

38:16.229 --> 38:19.981
that you lost the trust
of one of your own.

38:19.982 --> 38:22.799
Non.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.717
Mon cheri, non.

38:24.718 --> 38:27.678
Tout est possible.

38:27.679 --> 38:29.858
Ce n'est pas fini.

38:29.859 --> 38:32.352
Aah!
Desole.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.065
Aah!

39:06.831 --> 39:08.750
[Moaning]

39:08.751 --> 39:11.152
Davina, you're ok.

39:11.682 --> 39:13.821
You're safe now.
You hear me? You're safe.

39:14.393 --> 39:15.937
I won't let anyone
hurt you, ok?

39:24.916 --> 39:27.238
Rebekah!

39:27.239 --> 39:29.386
Rebekah!

39:30.855 --> 39:33.997
Cherish the breath
in your lungs!

39:34.443 --> 39:36.394
It'll be your last.

39:36.395 --> 39:40.877
The final act of
le grand guignol is upon us!

39:40.878 --> 39:44.018
Where are my players?

39:44.019 --> 39:46.187
Enough running, children!

39:46.188 --> 39:48.926
Step out of the shadows

39:48.927 --> 39:52.076
so we can finish
this tale of sorrows.

39:52.077 --> 39:54.361
He's coming.

39:59.834 --> 40:02.442
All right.
Come on, sister.

40:06.641 --> 40:09.142
Marcel.

40:14.620 --> 40:15.953
He's gone,
sister.

40:15.954 --> 40:18.069
No. No.

40:18.070 --> 40:19.687
Elijah: Both of you
must flee the city.

40:19.688 --> 40:21.239
I'll hold him off,
Niklaus.

40:21.240 --> 40:23.524
No.

40:23.525 --> 40:25.076
We fight him
together.

40:25.077 --> 40:26.778
Elijah:
We cannot fight him.

40:26.779 --> 40:28.196
All we can do is do
what we've done.

40:28.197 --> 40:29.781
We deceive him.
We lead him astray.

40:29.782 --> 40:31.804
Now, I can do that
as well as anyone.

40:32.234 --> 40:34.402
You take her
far away from here.

40:34.403 --> 40:36.516
I'll follow you.

40:36.517 --> 40:39.852
No, Elijah. You can't.
You can't, Elijah.

40:39.853 --> 40:42.543
This is just...
This is my fault.

40:42.544 --> 40:47.026
No. This is my fault,
Rebekah.

40:47.027 --> 40:50.852
I am so sorry.
I'm sorry.

40:50.853 --> 40:51.903
Marcel...

40:51.904 --> 40:53.086
[Alarm bell ringing]

40:57.454 --> 41:00.208
I thought we'd found
a home here.

41:03.431 --> 41:05.797
Niklaus, please.

41:06.368 --> 41:08.118
Sister, come.

41:11.205 --> 41:13.471
You must leave. Go.

41:15.994 --> 41:17.642
Leave!

41:29.007 --> 41:31.058
Elijah?

41:33.294 --> 41:35.847
What are you
doing here?

41:35.848 --> 41:37.148
Rebekah,
you should be

41:37.149 --> 41:39.245
on the other side
of the world by now.

41:39.246 --> 41:41.958
You and I both know that
wouldn't have been far enough.

41:43.321 --> 41:46.087
Get away from her!

41:49.360 --> 41:51.551
She's mine.
