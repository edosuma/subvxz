that conversation.

in the kitchen.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.002
- Carver, it's no big deal.

We shower and sleep together.

You know what I mean.

Anyway, I am done.

Hey, how did it go
with Lieutenant Walback

13:28.725 --> 13:29.934
- All good.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.187
- Really?
- Why wouldn't it?

13:32.228 --> 13:33.563
- Because everything
is awesome to him,

13:33.605 --> 13:35.732
and your good mornings
sound sarcastic,

13:35.774 --> 13:38.568
so I figured you two
would be like oil and water.

13:38.610 --> 13:39.819
- Nope.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.988
We actually hit it off.
Sorry to disappoint.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.199
- Oh.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.992
- I mean,
he's a fine lieutenant,

I was cleaning the vent.

16:06.591 --> 16:07.884
I fell in.

through all this duct work.

I know, for sure,
he'll take your call.

the subject of Emma Jacobs,

19:55.487 --> 19:56.780
it's a fraught one for you.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.740
- This isn't about
our history, Chief.

19:58.782 --> 20:02.619
No, it's about making sure that
Emma Jacobs isn't in a position

20:02.660 --> 20:04.788

ruin people's lives.

I am not looking
for payback here.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.627

20:10.669 --> 20:14.255
Because revenge
is a dead end road.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.919
- By threatening to manufacture
allegations against Hawkins

24:20.960 --> 24:23.838
that would have put him
in a very difficult spot

24:23.880 --> 24:25.882
that would have been
impossible for him to refute.

24:25.924 --> 24:27.801
Her plan might have worked,

24:27.842 --> 24:31.429

on the job first.

24:31.471 --> 24:32.847
- How do you know
about all this?

24:34.265 --> 24:36.601
- The allegations
were about me, sir.

24:38.061 --> 24:41.564
Hawkins told me all about her
scheme as it was playing out.

24:41.606 --> 24:43.233
- How did he tell you?

24:43.274 --> 24:48.738
In texts, emails, anything
that could serve as evidence?

24:48.780 --> 24:52.200

Sir, you have to believe me.

- When we roped Kidd down
into that vent,

26:43.728 --> 26:45.021
he kind of panicked.

Just for a second,
nothing huge.

it doesn't work that way.

27:05.834 --> 27:07.293
- Okay.

27:07.335 --> 27:10.422
so FYI, it has a backup battery
and a setting to go off

Why in the world

I didn't think so.
I was just trying to help.

29:26.558 --> 29:28.435
- Did you check
your voicemails?

29:28.476 --> 29:29.978
- Yeah, I even called
Evan's old assistant

29:30.020 --> 29:32.439

Emma in any emails or notes

he was always recording,

his office months ago.

It's only a matter of time

36:39.032 --> 36:42.118
- Why do I feel like I'm about
to be led to a firing squad?

36:42.160 --> 36:44.079
- Oh, we really don't trust
each other much, do we?

36:44.120 --> 36:45.622
- Mm.

36:45.663 --> 36:47.207
- Gotta work on that.

36:47.248 --> 36:50.335
- Just a suggestion, but you
could start by explaining

36:50.377 --> 36:51.586
why you asked me here.

36:51.628 --> 36:53.171
- Fair.
- Mm-hmm.

36:54.881 --> 36:59.427
- We never really got a chance
to talk about the explosion.

36:59.469 --> 37:01.721
- We were both there. So?

37:01.763 --> 37:03.598
- Yeah, and then
I was out on medical,

37:03.640 --> 37:07.018
and you were back on shift
two days later

37:07.060 --> 37:08.853
like it was nothing.

37:08.895 --> 37:09.896
- Mm-hmm.

37:13.149 --> 37:15.110
- I've been, uh...

37:16.778 --> 37:21.157
Having these nightmares lately

37:21.199 --> 37:24.077
pretty much every night.

37:24.119 --> 37:28.331
And I thought that
they would go away eventually,

37:28.373 --> 37:32.460
but, uh, here we are.

37:32.502 --> 37:34.295

37:34.337 --> 37:36.548
- Hmm.

37:36.589 --> 37:38.008
- What about you?

37:38.049 --> 37:40.552
- Nightmares? No.

37:40.593 --> 37:42.679
Not more than usual.

37:45.015 --> 37:47.767
- So you're 100%?

37:50.311 --> 37:53.648
Except all of a sudden,
your overconfidence,

37:53.690 --> 37:56.651
bad attitude
is completely gone.

37:56.693 --> 37:58.653
- You miss them?

37:58.695 --> 38:01.239
- And that's called deflection.

38:01.281 --> 38:04.576
- [laughs] Mm-hmm.

38:04.617 --> 38:06.077
- Mm-hmm.

38:10.290 --> 38:13.126
Truth is...

38:13.168 --> 38:16.713
I keep trying to put
the whole thing behind me.

38:17.881 --> 38:20.550
But every day I wake up,

38:20.592 --> 38:23.762
I see this scar on my side.

38:26.014 --> 38:30.268
And it all just
comes flooding back.

38:32.395 --> 38:33.646
- Scars are good for that.

38:33.688 --> 38:40.820
<i>* *</i>

38:50.080 --> 38:53.124
My older brother,
he was always a bully.

38:53.166 --> 38:54.876
But one night,
when I was nine years old,

38:54.918 --> 38:57.712
he took it up a notch.

38:57.754 --> 38:59.089
We were at this
big family bonfire,

38:59.130 --> 39:01.716
something we did
every July 4th.

39:01.758 --> 39:04.886
But this year,
when no one else was around,

39:04.928 --> 39:09.891
he snuck up behind me,
and he...

39:09.933 --> 39:12.852
shoved me into the flames.

39:14.062 --> 39:16.064
- No.

39:16.106 --> 39:20.193
- I dragged myself
out of there.

39:20.235 --> 39:23.113
I'll never forget the hell
of that pain.

39:23.154 --> 39:25.907
Meanwhile,
he ran and told everyone

39:25.949 --> 39:28.410
that I tripped and fell,

39:28.451 --> 39:31.746
and he saved me,

39:31.788 --> 39:33.206
like he's the big hero.

39:35.917 --> 39:38.753
No one believed my version,

39:38.795 --> 39:41.047
what actually happened,

39:41.089 --> 39:42.966
because that's too insane.

39:43.008 --> 39:44.843
Why would a 15-year-old kid
do that

39:44.884 --> 39:46.678
to his own little brother,
right?

39:46.720 --> 39:49.139
I must be lying.

39:49.180 --> 39:52.434
Let's put the whole thing
behind us,

39:52.475 --> 39:54.811
pretend it never happened.

39:54.853 --> 40:01.860
<i>* *</i>

40:02.944 --> 40:04.279
- I'm sorry, Carver.

40:07.866 --> 40:09.701
- Yeah, well...

40:13.663 --> 40:16.082
Guess I'm not used to being
the one who gets saved.

40:17.917 --> 40:20.628
And that's what you did.

40:20.670 --> 40:24.924
You got hurt by covering me.

40:24.966 --> 40:27.260
And I walked out of that house
without a scratch.

40:31.222 --> 40:35.894
And it's been hanging over me,
probably messing with my head.

40:42.609 --> 40:48.239
But I will pull it together,

40:48.281 --> 40:50.241
per my lieutenant's orders.
[chuckles]

40:54.662 --> 40:56.498
- Hey, maybe that's
all I need, too,

40:56.539 --> 41:00.126
you know, a higher-up just to
order me to pull it together.

41:00.168 --> 41:04.297
- Well, I was higher up
than you at the academy,

41:04.339 --> 41:07.008
so I could do it.

41:07.050 --> 41:09.511
- Mm.
And there's that attitude.

41:09.552 --> 41:12.305
[both laugh]

41:12.347 --> 41:13.848
- Yeah.
- Hey.

41:13.890 --> 41:16.685
See? It's working already.

41:16.726 --> 41:18.353
- Yeah.
