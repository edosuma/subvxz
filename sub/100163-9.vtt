<i>Oh, hey.</i>
<i>I didn't see you there.</i>

00:30.864 --> 00:32.466
<i>I'm Lex Luthor,</i>

00:32.500 --> 00:34.134
<i>and I'm here to tell you</i>

00:34.167 --> 00:36.036
<i>a little bit about</i>
<i>the Legion of Doom.</i>

00:36.070 --> 00:38.706
<i>The LOD</i>
<i>is a supportive community</i>

00:38.706 --> 00:40.021
<i>of elite supervillains</i>

00:40.021 --> 00:42.043
<i>dedicated to making the world</i>
<i>a worse place.</i>

00:42.043 --> 00:44.744
<i>We've been behind</i>
<i>some of the most evil plots</i>

00:44.777 --> 00:47.215

-[whispering inaudibly]
<i>-What's that?</i>

00:50.875 --> 00:52.753
<i>They're waiting</i>

00:52.753 --> 00:54.488
<i>Looks like</i>

00:54.521 --> 00:58.058

00:58.060 --> 00:59.060
[grunts]

00:59.060 --> 01:00.360
Hey, that's you!

01:00.395 --> 01:02.229
What did you say
to Black Manta

01:02.262 --> 01:03.697
to elicit such rage?

01:03.731 --> 01:05.632
Nothing racist.

01:05.665 --> 01:06.667
Guys, pull it together.

01:06.700 --> 01:07.867
We are about to join...

01:07.902 --> 01:09.670
The Legion of Doom.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.371
[crowd cheering]

01:11.406 --> 01:15.042
Welcome home, Harley.

01:15.075 --> 01:19.947
[theme music playing]

01:19.980 --> 01:21.381
And that's
all the time we have.

01:21.381 --> 01:22.250
[sighs]

01:22.250 --> 01:24.484
Oh, and my apologies to Bane

01:24.519 --> 01:25.885
who wanted to do some magic.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.155
It was going to be
a spectacle.

01:28.188 --> 01:31.525
[clears throat]
I'd like to say something.

01:31.558 --> 01:32.694
Oh, my God!

01:32.727 --> 01:35.462
When I heard we were
letting in Harley Quinn,

01:35.495 --> 01:36.763
I thought...

01:36.796 --> 01:40.602
[evil laughter]

01:40.635 --> 01:42.769
No one deserves
this opportunity

01:42.802 --> 01:43.903
more than she does.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.272
-Oh this guy.
-I'm sorry.

01:45.305 --> 01:47.775
But didn't he try to
kill you multiple times?

01:47.808 --> 01:49.176
I know, I know.

01:49.209 --> 01:51.344
I tried to kill you
multiple times,

01:51.379 --> 01:52.947
but frankly, Harley,

01:52.980 --> 01:55.682
now you're the one
killing it.

01:55.715 --> 01:57.051
-Wow...
-[claps]

01:57.084 --> 01:58.885
[crowd clapping]

01:58.918 --> 02:00.454
Oh, I've seen this before.

02:00.487 --> 02:03.457
It's just like the time
my ex, Sandra, called me up

02:03.490 --> 02:05.225
after I lost 20 pounds.

02:05.259 --> 02:09.195
Where were you
when I was still 2,750, Sandra?

02:09.195 --> 02:10.197
Where were you?

02:10.230 --> 02:11.699
I needed love then.

02:11.733 --> 02:14.534
Promise us you will not
make us the Jen Aniston

02:14.568 --> 02:18.639
to your Bradley Pitt's
feverish pursuit of co-star

02:18.671 --> 02:20.873
Ann-halina Yo-lee.

02:20.907 --> 02:22.409
Wow, that's a lot to unpack.

02:22.443 --> 02:25.044
Guys, guys, come on!
Give me a little credit here.

02:25.079 --> 02:27.247
Joker saying
a few nice things about me

02:27.281 --> 02:29.250
ain't gonna make me see him
any different, okay?

02:29.282 --> 02:30.383
Pick a card.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.086
When my mind's set, it is set.

02:32.120 --> 02:34.421
Hell, they blew out three
electric shock machines
at Arkham

02:34.455 --> 02:35.856
trying to get through to me.

02:35.889 --> 02:38.158
I am done giving that clown
second chances.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.826
Is your card

02:39.860 --> 02:41.794
the three of hearts?

02:41.829 --> 02:46.633
-No.
-Fuck!

02:46.667 --> 02:51.305
[inaudible]

02:51.338 --> 02:52.639
[dog barking in distance]

02:52.674 --> 02:54.640
Okay, look. I know
the last time we talked,

02:54.675 --> 02:56.711
it was... Shitty.

02:56.743 --> 02:59.612
But, you know, I feel like
maybe we have an opportunity
to start over here.

02:59.612 --> 03:00.548
Hmm.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.783
Okay. We can
build off "hmm."

03:02.817 --> 03:05.652
I also, obviously,
would like to apologize

03:05.652 --> 03:07.187
for saying
you're jealous of me

03:07.221 --> 03:08.889
and that you got
no friends and that--

03:08.889 --> 03:10.625
All right, thank you.
I remember what you said.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.293
I know you were just
trying to protect me, and...

03:12.293 --> 03:14.161
Listen, I am gonna do
the same for you, okay?

03:14.194 --> 03:16.030
Just 'cause
I'm a card carryin' member

03:16.062 --> 03:17.230
of the Legion of Doom now--

03:17.264 --> 03:18.532
Fuck that place in the ass.

03:18.566 --> 03:19.936
Yes. For sure.
Although, listen...

03:19.968 --> 03:21.699
I am working there

03:21.699 --> 03:23.037
and I hope it doesn't
affect our friendship.

03:23.037 --> 03:25.004
I would be dead without you.

03:25.004 --> 03:26.006
Like, a lot.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.375
I do not disagree with that.

03:27.407 --> 03:29.443
I mean, I'm glad
you're not dead, but...

03:29.477 --> 03:30.878
I don't know, it just...

03:30.912 --> 03:32.913
It felt like you were so ready
to abandon me.

03:32.947 --> 03:35.014
I would never do that.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.584
I will always be there for ya.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.852
I will always smash things

03:38.885 --> 03:41.055
you might need smashed, Ive.

03:41.087 --> 03:42.389
Wait, I know that look.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.058
Is there something
you need smashed?

03:44.058 --> 03:45.752
Come on, Ive, there's gotta be
something you need smashed.

03:45.752 --> 03:47.594
There is... There is something
actually, I've been working on.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.362
I knew it! You're gonna do
something evil.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.931
That is great!

03:50.931 --> 03:52.633
Yeah. You know, I mean,
if we're still categorizing

03:52.633 --> 03:54.901
fighting to protect
the environment as "evil,"

03:54.935 --> 03:56.905
then sure.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.907
[man] <i>At our new</i>

fired up, Ive.

04:11.384 --> 04:12.653
You are glowing.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.421
Count me in on destroying
this new factory.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.190
Really? Great.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.326
Okay. Let's meet up
on Friday night
and go over a plan.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.627
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I got this.

04:19.661 --> 04:21.329
The Legion gave me
a corporate card

04:21.362 --> 04:22.663
and said I can expense
any meal

04:22.663 --> 04:24.365
where I talk about
doing something evil.

04:24.398 --> 04:27.233
Yeah, once again, it's just...
We're saving plants,

04:27.267 --> 04:29.136
we're not actually
doing something evil...

04:29.170 --> 04:31.004
You know what? [sighing]

04:31.038 --> 04:32.495
Thanks, Harls.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.244
We added a little something
we thought you might enjoy.

-Oh, my God.

Oh, my God!

04:47.221 --> 04:48.622
So thoughtful.

oak, pine...

And... Just one chair.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.029

supposed to sit?

04:55.029 --> 04:57.331
Oh, we have special offices
for all of you.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.531
My assistant cultural attache,

04:59.531 --> 05:01.595
Esteban, will take you.

05:01.595 --> 05:04.237
Why, hello, Esteban!

05:04.271 --> 05:06.908
And from what exotic
<i>pueblito</i>

05:06.940 --> 05:09.744
on the Iberian Peninsula
might you derive?

05:09.776 --> 05:12.213
It's Steve,
and I'm from Tulsa.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.113
I don't know why
Mr. Luthor calls me that,

05:14.148 --> 05:15.384
but he always does.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.951
Follow me.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.553
Okay. [chuckling]
Come on.

05:19.586 --> 05:20.754
I know where I'm going.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.889
I remember
where my old office is.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.057
Yeah, that's been filled.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.326
We have something else for you.

05:25.326 --> 05:29.028
Why did you hit down
on the elevator?

05:29.062 --> 05:30.129
[elevator bell dings]

05:30.163 --> 05:31.598
And here we are.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.466
[Dr. Psycho] No, no. No, no,
I know this place.

05:33.466 --> 05:36.470
This is where they keep
the goons and the henchmen.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.504
Right. Like you.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.473
[tutting] We're not goons.

05:39.507 --> 05:40.874
We're not henchmen.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.041
We have powers.

05:42.076 --> 05:43.944
That's right. I am an actor!

05:43.976 --> 05:45.545
You are not an actor.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.447
You are a huge pile of clay

05:47.447 --> 05:48.951
that can turn
into anything you want.

05:48.983 --> 05:52.119
He is a giant half-shark man.

05:52.151 --> 05:54.555
And I am a telepath.

05:54.555 --> 05:57.124
We have actual powers!

05:57.156 --> 05:58.660
Uh, calm down,
Dr. [bleep] Guy.

05:58.694 --> 06:01.394
This is where
you're supposed to be,
and you're lucky.

06:01.428 --> 06:04.398
Touch whatever you want.
Everything's broken.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.300
Goons, you're with me.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.468
The hell we are!

06:08.502 --> 06:11.038
We work for Harley.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.940
And now, for me, too.

06:12.973 --> 06:16.410
I've signed you out
for a very important mission.

06:16.444 --> 06:19.012
I got a razzy zazzy for "Bang."

06:19.045 --> 06:20.480
It's Bane!

06:20.514 --> 06:22.182
You know it's Bane.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.651
I'm here everyday, Todd.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.185
Goddamn millennials.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.053
Whatever, Bang! [chuckling]

06:27.086 --> 06:28.389
[groans]

06:28.422 --> 06:31.190
So, we're blowing up Todd
after dinner.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.293
Don't eat so much
you get lethargic,

06:33.326 --> 06:35.264
but eat enough
that you don't get fainty

06:35.298 --> 06:38.232
'cause I do not bring snacks.

06:38.264 --> 06:43.264
The streets will run
with razzy zazzy.

06:44.072 --> 06:46.206
And thanks to Black Manta
for the bagels.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.642
There's only cinnamon raisins!

06:48.675 --> 06:50.411
You know I hate raisins!

06:50.444 --> 06:53.913
Oh! [chuckling] Wait.
Here's an everything.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.050
So, Harley,

06:55.083 --> 06:57.218
every week we meet
to pitch our evil ideas.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.451
This is where
we get approval

06:58.451 --> 06:59.553
for the use
of Legion resources

06:59.553 --> 07:01.187
like goons and getaway cars.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.757
And s'plosions!

07:02.757 --> 07:05.341
I have no idea what the fuck
"s'plosions" are, Bane,

07:05.341 --> 07:07.194
but we do have explosives.

07:07.228 --> 07:10.216
So this is the place to get
creative feedback on ideas.

07:10.216 --> 07:11.216
Exactly.

07:11.216 --> 07:12.867
We modeled it after the way
they do things at Pixar.

07:12.867 --> 07:15.869
I wish they would make
another <i>Up</i> movie.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.004
They can't.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.673
The story was over
at the end of the first.

07:18.706 --> 07:19.973
[Scarecrow] Unless,

07:20.007 --> 07:22.076
the kid is the old man
in the sequel.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.411
Oh, that's fun!

07:23.444 --> 07:24.745
That's a good one.

07:24.745 --> 07:25.913
Can we stop
with the nonsense, please?

07:25.913 --> 07:27.848
-Who wants to start?
-Okay!

07:27.882 --> 07:30.418
So, I want to build
a giant tower

07:30.451 --> 07:31.485
with my face on it.

07:31.519 --> 07:32.720
Loving this.

07:32.754 --> 07:35.057
My quote unquote "mouth"
opens up...

07:35.091 --> 07:38.459
Boom! Reveals a giant TV.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.992
What's on it? Me!

07:40.026 --> 07:41.295
I open with a joke,

07:41.327 --> 07:43.363
threaten Gotham,
you get the rest.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.966
[laughing wickedly]

07:46.000 --> 07:48.702
I need 800 million,
but I can do it for six.

07:48.735 --> 07:51.639
[chuckling]
Six hundred million!
I mean, that's a bargain.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.274
I... I'm still trying
to get a chair.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.076
Shall we move to approve?

07:57.110 --> 07:59.213
[clock ticking]

07:59.245 --> 08:01.081
-Harley?
-I don't get it.

08:01.115 --> 08:03.151
You don't... Get it?

08:03.184 --> 08:05.653
Well, for starters,
why do you need a tower?

08:05.685 --> 08:07.488
Right?
If you want to get on TV,

08:07.488 --> 08:09.089
why don't you just take over
the airwaves
like everybody else?

08:09.124 --> 08:11.692
Because everyone else
has already done it.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.995
-Fucking Bane's done it.
-Yeah, I done it.

08:13.995 --> 08:15.899
Okay, well then, why not just
take over an existing tower?

08:15.899 --> 08:17.899
Why are we building
a new tower?

08:17.932 --> 08:20.901
Because a regular tower
doesn't have a fire pole

08:20.901 --> 08:23.670
that goes from top
to the bottom, that's why.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.439
That's a bit garish, innit?
Why do you need that?

08:25.439 --> 08:26.807
Because I'm the Joker!

08:26.839 --> 08:28.175
Hmm.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.144
Feels a little like you
came up with the frosting...

08:30.144 --> 08:32.647
-Before you baked the cake.
-Exactly.

08:32.679 --> 08:33.681
Thank you, Harley.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.283
You haven't baked the cake.

08:35.283 --> 08:37.351
Why don't you come back to us
after you bake the cake,

08:37.351 --> 08:38.351
huh, Joker?

08:38.384 --> 08:39.720
Fine.

08:39.754 --> 08:42.722
I'll bake the fucking cake.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.557
You know, it's not...
It's refreshing.

08:44.591 --> 08:45.826
I am glad that

08:45.826 --> 08:48.195
someone finally stood up
to that clown.

08:48.227 --> 08:50.063
Oh! Hey, Joker.

08:50.097 --> 08:53.167
I was just telling Harley
how uncool she was.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.836
Being in the meeting earlier

08:54.836 --> 08:56.238
-and having the gall--
-[squirting]

08:56.238 --> 08:58.339
[grunting]

08:58.371 --> 09:00.807
[choking]

09:00.841 --> 09:02.909
[blubbering]
It's leaking everywhere.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.245
About that meeting,
I wanted to say--

09:05.245 --> 09:07.849
-Look, if you came here
to yell at me then--
-Thank you!

09:07.881 --> 09:09.817
-Uh, what?
-That plan needed work.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.686
I'm going to put the time in,

09:11.719 --> 09:13.888
and really make it
something special.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.423
But I'm happy
I finally have someone here

09:16.456 --> 09:18.025
with the guts
to stand up to me.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.227
Maybe we could grab a drink
so I could pick your brain

09:20.227 --> 09:23.397
with this whole giant-tower-
with-my-face-on-it thing.

09:23.429 --> 09:24.565
Yeah, I don't think so.

09:24.597 --> 09:26.267
A work drink.

09:26.267 --> 09:27.903
I could give you the lowdown
on how to game the system here.

09:27.903 --> 09:30.471
Really? And not have sex
with each other?

09:30.504 --> 09:32.773
Harley, please!
[chuckling] I'm blushing.

09:32.807 --> 09:34.341
We're colleagues now.

09:34.375 --> 09:37.510
You don't see me having sex
with Scarecrow or Bane.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.379
The answer's, no, I don't...

09:39.413 --> 09:41.149
Do that with them.

09:41.182 --> 09:46.182
Just a work drink.
Think about it.

09:49.789 --> 09:51.558
Harley, we have a problem.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.028
They put us in the goon poo-el.

09:54.062 --> 09:55.562
-Ooh, that sounds fun.
-Fun?

09:55.596 --> 09:57.899
It's not the fun kind of pool.

09:57.932 --> 10:00.768
They're treating us
like we're common henchmen

10:00.802 --> 10:03.671
and we have to work
for anyone who asks.

10:03.703 --> 10:05.673
-Including Bane.
-Bane!

10:05.706 --> 10:06.908
-[exclaiming]
-What?

10:06.941 --> 10:09.311
Bane? Ugh!
We only work together.

10:09.344 --> 10:11.846
Well, they're saying something
entirely different.

10:11.879 --> 10:14.316
Don't worry. You won't be
working for Bane, I promise.

10:14.349 --> 10:16.918
Ugh, I just gotta figure out
how to game the system here.

10:16.951 --> 10:19.988
And how, pray tell,
will you do that?

10:20.020 --> 10:23.691
I'll pray tell a colleague
about it.

10:23.724 --> 10:24.892
So... [laughing]

10:24.926 --> 10:26.562
I've been paying
this smoothie kid

10:26.596 --> 10:29.229
to keep writing "Bang"
on all his orders.

10:29.263 --> 10:30.530
[laughing] Oh, my God,

10:30.530 --> 10:31.966
that's the guy
Bane wants to blow up.

10:31.966 --> 10:34.635
Oh! That's fantastic.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.504
[exclaims] You know,
everyone remembers me
for the big crimes,

10:37.538 --> 10:38.873
the murders, the cripplings,

10:38.905 --> 10:41.442
but it's the little ones
that keep me going.

10:41.442 --> 10:42.809
[chuckling softly]
That's hilarious.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.514
If it was hilarious,
you'd be laughing.

10:44.547 --> 10:47.048
You can't just say
something's hilarious.

10:47.081 --> 10:48.916
That's the worst
kind of audience.

10:48.950 --> 10:50.851
[sighs] Sorry,
I got a lot on my mind.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.386
You know,
Bane wants to use my crew

10:52.386 --> 10:54.254
to blow up that smoothie kid,
and they're pissed.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.755
Who do I talk to
to get them out of that?

10:55.755 --> 10:57.859
Um, me. [chuckling]

10:57.892 --> 10:59.293
I'll talk to Lex.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.761
He wants to keep you happy.
You're an asset.

11:01.796 --> 11:03.832
-Really? He thinks that?
-Everyone thinks that.

11:03.866 --> 11:06.767
You're a big deal.
You're Harley Quinn!

11:06.801 --> 11:08.068
Wow, I...

11:08.101 --> 11:10.604
-[piano music playing]
-Wow! Holy shit!

11:10.638 --> 11:11.687
Thanks.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.245
[Frank] Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.447
So your ass is gonna take down
that place by yourself?

11:20.480 --> 11:21.716
There's not a plant around it.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.884
First of all,
I am a capable metahuman

11:23.918 --> 11:25.619
who doesn't always
need the plants.

11:25.653 --> 11:27.288
And also,
Harley's gonna show up

11:27.288 --> 11:28.923
and, like, smash some people
with her bat, too.

11:28.923 --> 11:31.524
Harley? I don't see Harley
around here.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.860
You know who I see?

11:32.894 --> 11:34.729
Frank. I'm ready
to fuck some shit up.

11:34.729 --> 11:36.197
You're in a pot, Frank.
I'd have to carry you.

11:36.197 --> 11:39.332
So what?
I carry you emotionally.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.902
We all carry shit.

11:40.902 --> 11:42.836
You bring me in there
and I'll show you some damage.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.605
How, Frank? What am I gonna,
like, throw you at people

11:45.639 --> 11:47.041
and you're gonna eat them?

11:47.075 --> 11:49.177
Boom! Look at that.
We just figured it out.

11:49.210 --> 11:51.147
Thanks, but I think
Harley and I can take care
of this. [chuckling]

11:51.181 --> 11:53.480
Like the way
you took care of that outfit?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.149
-[laughs boisterously]
-Why? What's wrong with it?

11:55.149 --> 11:57.751
You see fabulous,
I see fugly.

11:57.784 --> 12:00.287
You got to diversify
your color palette, woman!

12:00.320 --> 12:01.489
Spice that shit up!

12:01.523 --> 12:03.057
Add a fun hat.

12:03.091 --> 12:05.095
Maybe a little blush
on your cheeks and shit.

12:05.128 --> 12:08.028
See? See, see,
I don't just eat people.

12:08.062 --> 12:10.466
Hurtful words are another
weapon in my arsenal.

12:10.500 --> 12:14.001
And you just got
a verbal ass whooping.

12:14.035 --> 12:16.403
[sighs]

12:16.437 --> 12:17.671
So, how have you been?

12:17.705 --> 12:19.274
Oh, you know,
same old, same old.

12:19.307 --> 12:21.942
Murdering, hijacking,
WMDs, arson.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.577
Ooh, I've been rewatching
a lot of <i>Scrubs.</i>

12:24.611 --> 12:25.779
What happened to Zach Braff?

12:25.812 --> 12:27.081
Wait, wait.
Didn't we kill him

12:27.081 --> 12:28.650
when we took that
movie studio hostage?

12:28.650 --> 12:30.317
Remember, we were
trying to force him

12:30.350 --> 12:32.452
to remake classic movies,
but with cats?

12:32.485 --> 12:34.188
Ha! I'm telling you,

12:34.222 --> 12:38.024
"Cats-ablanca" would have
blown the original
out of the water. [laughs]

12:38.058 --> 12:40.394
Anyway, I think
Zach Braff is alive.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.729
-Oh.
-Just not working.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.164
-Ah!.
-Oh, Harley...

12:44.197 --> 12:46.500
We had some fun
back in the day, didn't we?

12:46.533 --> 12:48.434
Oh, we sure did.

12:48.469 --> 12:50.035
[cell phone vibrating]

12:50.070 --> 12:51.306
Mmm.

12:51.306 --> 12:52.639
All right, you know,
I really better get going.

12:52.639 --> 12:53.874
Sorry to interrupt,

12:53.874 --> 12:55.708
but I, like,
totally ship you guys.

12:55.743 --> 12:57.144
Seriously.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.711
You're, like, my favorite
evil couple in Gotham.

12:58.711 --> 12:59.711
These are on the house.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.115
[chuckling] Oh, thank you.

13:01.149 --> 13:06.149
Come on, you can stay
for five more minutes?

13:09.722 --> 13:10.758
[sighs]

13:10.791 --> 13:12.025
There, she is, over there.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.460
The green one
with the fun hat on.

13:13.494 --> 13:15.028
Uh, Frank, who is this person?

13:15.028 --> 13:17.264
You said I couldn't do nothin'
'cause I was in this pot.

13:17.298 --> 13:19.232
-Meet Chaz.
-This is really
getting heavy, man.

13:19.265 --> 13:20.467
He's my pot guy.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.034
Carries my pot around
wherever I need to go.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.339
He sells marijuana, Frank.

13:23.371 --> 13:24.705
He misread his ad.

13:24.739 --> 13:25.873
That is also true.

13:25.907 --> 13:27.140
Yet, here we are.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.009
[exhales] Okay.
Well, I'm leaving.

13:29.043 --> 13:30.544
So why don't you have him
bring you back
to the apartment.

13:30.578 --> 13:32.712
Wait, I thought
you were meeting Harley here.

13:32.746 --> 13:34.014
Oh, shit!

13:34.048 --> 13:35.450
She stood your ass up.

13:35.450 --> 13:37.118
No, no, no.
She just had to reschedule.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.686
You know,
she ended her text in "ugh."

13:38.719 --> 13:40.120
So I know that she just,
you know,

13:40.120 --> 13:41.322
she didn't wanna reschedule
but she had to.

13:41.322 --> 13:42.523
You know, things come up.
It's fine.

13:42.523 --> 13:43.823
Nah, she's changed.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.092
Thinks she's a bigshot now.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.760
Hell, I know this pear tree,

13:46.793 --> 13:48.328
survived 9/11,

13:48.328 --> 13:50.331
now he's planted
front and center
at the Freedom Tower

13:50.331 --> 13:52.299
and that motherfucker
won't even call me back.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.437
Harley is nothing like
your 9/11 pear tree friend.

13:55.437 --> 13:57.304
And, by the way,
I know that tree, okay?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.505
He was a dick before 9/11,
he's a dick now.

13:59.539 --> 14:00.908
That asshole changed

14:00.942 --> 14:02.210
and so has Harley.

14:02.243 --> 14:06.413
Trust me, you're on your own.

14:06.447 --> 14:07.514
[King Shark] Oh, man!

14:07.548 --> 14:08.783
They only have potato chips

14:08.816 --> 14:10.618
with the weird Korean flavor.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.587
"Cheddar and octopus ranch"?

14:12.621 --> 14:14.621
Could be delicious!

14:14.654 --> 14:16.023
I would give it a whirl.

14:16.057 --> 14:18.392
Put down those snacks,
you dumb goons.

14:18.392 --> 14:19.360
It's time to go.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.928
We're not going anywhere
with you,

14:21.962 --> 14:23.429
S&M Sally!

14:23.464 --> 14:24.731
Harley took care of it.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.333
I filed
all the proper paperwork.

14:26.366 --> 14:30.870
I even got the green light
from HR, so...

14:30.904 --> 14:32.038
Your move.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.606
How disappointing!

14:33.640 --> 14:35.143
Right? But don't worry.

14:35.176 --> 14:37.077
I'll call Harley
and we'll sort this out.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.111
I meant these chips.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.379
They're disappointing.

14:39.413 --> 14:42.448
I'm not tasting the...
Oh, wait!

14:42.482 --> 14:43.985
There's the octopus!

14:44.018 --> 14:46.653
-Damn! It went to voicemail.
-[Bane] That's that then.

14:46.687 --> 14:48.188
Saddle up,
<i>muchachos.</i>

14:48.221 --> 14:51.859
We have a juicery to es'plode!

14:51.892 --> 14:53.460
[crushes]

14:53.494 --> 14:57.397
[both laughing heartily]

14:57.431 --> 14:58.966
[both exclaim]

14:59.000 --> 15:00.400
I missed this.

15:00.434 --> 15:02.369
[stuttering] This isn't...
Come on...

15:02.402 --> 15:04.105
Now, this is just

15:04.105 --> 15:06.539
an extension
of the business conversation
from earlier.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.109
-Oh, for sure.
-Cool.

15:08.142 --> 15:10.644
-Cool.
-Cool. We're just cool.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.547
-Yeah.
-[woman] Monsters!

15:12.580 --> 15:15.950
She's eating
the beef tenderloin
with a fish fork.

15:15.982 --> 15:17.118
[woman screaming]

15:17.150 --> 15:18.486
[both laughing wickedly]

15:18.520 --> 15:20.288
Okay, I did miss this.

15:20.321 --> 15:23.157
[continues laughing wickedly]

15:23.191 --> 15:25.326
Now, this is living.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.427
Yeah. Hey, you know,
I had a thought

15:27.461 --> 15:29.996
about that tower
with your face on it
you pitched at the meeting?

15:30.030 --> 15:31.331
Oh, my face tower?

15:31.365 --> 15:32.966
That... That would be the one.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.035
I was thinking
you could build it underground

15:35.068 --> 15:36.303
and when you wanna unveil it,

15:36.336 --> 15:37.804
it can shoot above the surface

15:37.837 --> 15:39.340
and scare the shit
out of people.

15:39.374 --> 15:42.009
-Ooh, like a Jack in the box!
-Exactly!

15:42.043 --> 15:43.277
[chuckling] Love that.

15:43.311 --> 15:45.745
It's very on brand for me,
I mean.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.033
Wow, really?

15:47.033 --> 15:49.250
I don't think you've ever taken
one of my ideas before.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.951
The student becomes
another master.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.321
Uh, I think the phrase is,

15:53.354 --> 15:55.155
"The student becomes
<i>the</i> master."

15:55.188 --> 15:58.692
No, I believe it's,
"The student becomes
<i>a</i> master

15:58.725 --> 16:00.360
"equal to the original master,

16:00.394 --> 16:02.663
"but not with more mastery
than that master."

16:02.697 --> 16:05.932
So you're not upset I decided
to go off on my own?

16:05.966 --> 16:08.369
If this is
the Harley Quinn solo act,

16:08.403 --> 16:11.339
I just have one thing to say...

16:11.371 --> 16:12.873
I wish it'd had
happened sooner.

16:12.907 --> 16:14.075
[laughs] Bravo!

16:14.107 --> 16:18.307
-Oh! [chuckling]
-[laughing]

16:21.815 --> 16:23.317
[Batman]
Up to your old tricks again.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.919
Well, you're gonna be
spending a lifetime together

16:25.952 --> 16:28.321
in Arkham.

16:28.355 --> 16:31.926
[beeps]

16:31.958 --> 16:35.629
[helicopter whirring]

16:35.662 --> 16:38.231
[grunting]

16:38.265 --> 16:41.168
You know, I'd love
to take you, puddin'...

16:41.201 --> 16:44.138
You know, I'd love
to take you, puddin',

16:44.138 --> 16:45.541
but I'd never deny you
the pleasure

16:45.573 --> 16:48.009
of buying me time to escape.

16:48.042 --> 16:49.309
[echoes]

16:49.344 --> 16:51.544
So get the hell on,
you knucklehead!

16:51.577 --> 16:52.879
Oh!

16:52.913 --> 16:53.947
What you grinning at?

16:53.980 --> 16:54.981
You comin' or what?

16:55.015 --> 16:59.352
[exclaims excitedly]

16:59.385 --> 17:04.325
[grunts]

17:04.358 --> 17:06.560
[Harley] Us,
escaping together? [chuckles]

17:06.594 --> 17:09.029
I used to dream
about this moment.

17:09.063 --> 17:10.330
[laughing] Oh, Harley!

17:10.365 --> 17:12.032
I couldn't leave you
on the boat.

17:12.066 --> 17:13.534
I need you.

17:13.567 --> 17:14.902
For this.

17:14.934 --> 17:17.184
-[kisses]
-Mmm.

17:19.973 --> 17:21.474
And this!

17:21.508 --> 17:24.057
[laughs wickedly]

17:27.914 --> 17:30.164
[heart beating]

17:37.691 --> 17:39.941
[beating slows]

17:51.305 --> 17:56.105
Some things
never change, Quinn.

18:01.749 --> 18:03.284
Has Harley called back yet?

18:03.284 --> 18:05.020
[sarcastically] Yeah! And
she said she fixed everything,

18:05.020 --> 18:06.921
and I just didn't tell you.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.088
Fantastic!

18:08.088 --> 18:09.190
What's taking
your shark friend

18:09.190 --> 18:10.258
so long to plant the bomb?

18:10.290 --> 18:11.459
Oh, I don't know.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.428
Maybe it's because
he's a shark

18:13.428 --> 18:15.834
and not a demolitions expert.

18:15.834 --> 18:17.464
Todd must pay
for what he's done.

18:17.498 --> 18:21.801
Let's see whose name
is Bang now, Todd.

18:21.835 --> 18:23.270
[clicks]
[blasts]

18:23.304 --> 18:24.739
[glass breaking]

18:24.739 --> 18:26.573
-Ah! Good Lord!
-[people screaming distantly]

18:26.573 --> 18:27.974
[thuds]

18:28.008 --> 18:29.277
-[groaning]
-Oh!

18:29.309 --> 18:32.011
Hey, Shark guy,
did we kill Todd?

18:32.046 --> 18:33.180
[groaning] Todd...

18:33.213 --> 18:36.317
Doesn't work Wednesdays.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.551
Oh, he must have
changed the schedule.

18:38.585 --> 18:39.720
[exhales]

18:39.720 --> 18:40.686
[machine beeping]

18:40.686 --> 18:41.873
Why, Lord?

18:41.873 --> 18:44.191
Why take him
when you could have me instead?

18:44.224 --> 18:47.394
I am a perfectly
delicious substitute.
[sobbing]

18:47.394 --> 18:49.298
What the hell
are you talking about?

18:49.298 --> 18:50.298
He's still alive.

18:50.298 --> 18:51.665
Huh? Oh, I was rehearsing.

18:51.665 --> 18:54.375
I have an audition
for a margarine commercial.

18:54.375 --> 18:55.636
[King Shark]
Well, it was very moving.

18:55.636 --> 18:58.472
Although, that could be
the morphine talking.

18:58.506 --> 19:00.074
I love everybody right now.

19:00.074 --> 19:01.769
I came as soon as I heard.
How's he doing?

19:01.769 --> 19:03.310
-[machine beeping rapidly]
-Oh, my God!

19:03.310 --> 19:04.479
I think he's going
into cardiac arrest.

19:04.479 --> 19:05.980
Someone? Nurse? Somebody!

19:06.013 --> 19:08.882
No, that's actually a pretty
standard shark heartbeat.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.183
-I'm fine.
-Oh, no shit?

19:10.183 --> 19:11.586
So where's Harley?

19:11.586 --> 19:13.421
She said she got help up
with some Legion shit,

19:13.421 --> 19:14.821
but I figured she'd come
running as soon as she heard.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.624
Patrick Swayze's ghost!

19:16.624 --> 19:18.224
It appears
we've been deceived.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.599
<i>Ooh!</i>

19:19.599 --> 19:21.561
<i>It looks like Jo-Quinn</i>
<i>is back together.</i>

19:21.561 --> 19:22.931
<i>Less than an hour ago,</i>

19:22.931 --> 19:25.380
<i>former lovebirds</i>
<i>Harley Quinn and Joker</i>

19:25.380 --> 19:27.634
<i>were spotted</i>
<i>tonguing each other down.</i>

19:27.634 --> 19:28.669
[clicks]

19:28.669 --> 19:31.271
[machine beeping]

19:31.305 --> 19:32.606
[Harley] Hey, everyone!

19:32.640 --> 19:34.442
Oh, I'm so sorry
I didn't get here sooner.

19:34.474 --> 19:37.243
I got held up at a crazy
Legion board meeting and then--

19:37.278 --> 19:42.152
[machine continues beeping]

19:42.185 --> 19:44.384
-Oh!
-It is one thing

19:44.384 --> 19:46.119
when I thought you
ditched me for the Legion,

19:46.119 --> 19:47.454
but him?

19:47.454 --> 19:48.623
I thought you were
better than that, man.

19:48.623 --> 19:50.757
No, I am.
And I see that now.

19:50.790 --> 19:51.959
Too late.

19:51.959 --> 19:53.326
You promised
you'd extricate us

19:53.361 --> 19:54.728
from having to join Bane,

19:54.760 --> 19:55.863
but you didn't,

19:55.895 --> 19:57.064
and now, look!

19:57.096 --> 19:58.666
Some of us
got our fins blown off.

19:58.701 --> 20:00.634
I'll tell you one thing.

20:00.634 --> 20:02.938
A Japanese chef offered
a large sum of money for it

20:02.938 --> 20:06.036
and you weren't even there
to tell me to not consider it!

20:06.036 --> 20:08.809
Because you were canoodling
with the Joker instead.

20:08.843 --> 20:11.913
I know, but the whole reason
I even met with Joker

20:11.913 --> 20:14.181
was to figure out how to
get you guys out of doing that.

20:14.181 --> 20:15.248
-I mean--
-[scoffs] Oh, please.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.384
-Drivel!
-Ive, you, you...

20:16.416 --> 20:17.518
You got to understand.

20:17.551 --> 20:19.053
No! Not this time, Harley.

20:19.086 --> 20:20.688
I have done
everything in my power

20:20.688 --> 20:22.522
to keep you away
from that ass clown

20:22.557 --> 20:24.592
because I truly believe
that you deserve better.

20:24.592 --> 20:26.592
But you know what? I am done
believing in someone

20:26.596 --> 20:29.028
who just doesn't believe
in herself.

20:29.063 --> 20:32.098
I'm... [stuttering]
I'm sorry, Ive...

20:32.133 --> 20:33.901
I made a mistake.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.269
I know I did.

20:35.269 --> 20:36.269
It won't happen again.

20:36.304 --> 20:37.738
-Bullshit!
-Poppycock!

20:37.770 --> 20:38.772
It's true, Harley.

20:38.807 --> 20:41.142
You're like the fish
that cried Orca.

20:41.174 --> 20:43.009
It's a story
remarkably similar

20:43.042 --> 20:44.479
to that
boy who cried Wolf,

20:44.479 --> 20:47.347
except that instead of a boy,
it's a fish,

20:47.381 --> 20:49.549
-and instead of a wolf--
-It's an orca.

20:49.584 --> 20:52.685
No! It's a wolf named Orca,

20:52.719 --> 20:53.753
but it can swim,

20:53.787 --> 20:55.189
which is terrifying.

20:55.189 --> 20:56.723
And also morphine induced,

20:56.758 --> 20:58.558
but the point
he's trying to make is,

20:58.593 --> 21:01.162
we are out of the crew!

21:01.194 --> 21:02.296
-[slams door]
-Clayface!

21:02.329 --> 21:03.964
I'm sorry,

21:03.964 --> 21:06.066
but I have a regional
margarine commercial
audition

21:06.066 --> 21:08.102
that starts in seven hours.

21:08.134 --> 21:10.637
-King?
-I have a catheter inside me,

21:10.672 --> 21:12.373
so I can't currently leave,

21:12.405 --> 21:15.442
but please note that
as soon as I'm able to urinate

21:15.476 --> 21:16.910
in a normal fashion,

21:16.943 --> 21:21.182
I am also out of the crew.

21:21.214 --> 21:22.583
Please, don't go.

21:22.616 --> 21:25.251
Sorry, I... I have my own plan
to focus on,

21:25.251 --> 21:27.021
but you probably
don't remember that anyway.

21:27.021 --> 21:29.259
No, I do and I still wanna
help you with it.

21:29.292 --> 21:32.393
I think I'd rather go solo
on this one.

21:32.425 --> 21:34.161
I need people I can count on.

21:34.194 --> 21:37.345
[door creaks, closes]

21:53.446 --> 21:54.946
[creaking]

22:00.287 --> 22:04.186
[vents hissing, whooshing]

22:05.459 --> 22:07.709
[alarm blaring]

22:13.166 --> 22:16.202
[coughing]

22:16.237 --> 22:20.374
[choking]

22:20.374 --> 22:21.375
[man] Yeah, boss.

22:21.409 --> 22:23.309
We got her.

22:23.344 --> 22:28.344
[theme music playing]
