This season on <i> Ink Master...</i>

00:04.086 --> 00:07.549
18 masters and apprentices
are battling it out

00:07.632 --> 00:11.261
to prove they're the best.

00:11.344 --> 00:15.557
On the last episode,
redemption was on the line...

00:15.640 --> 00:17.267
- This is gonna be interesting.
- [bleep], yeah.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.102
{\an5}(announcer)
When masters tattooed
head-to-head

00:19.185 --> 00:23.398
against their apprentices
for the second time.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.358
I've beaten Kito before,
and I'm confident

00:25.442 --> 00:26.776
that I'm still going
to beat Kito.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.945
Dave [bleep] me royally.

00:29.028 --> 00:30.739
The snake is just bad.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.365
{\an5}(Dave)
There's no belly.
There's no belly scales.

00:32.448 --> 00:33.450
There's no teeth.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.118
Y'all like beating
a dead horse, man.

00:35.201 --> 00:36.286
[bleep] move on.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.747
If you can't suck it up
and take it like a man,

00:38.830 --> 00:39.956
you're in the wrong place.

00:40.039 --> 00:41.666
Back the [bleep] up.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.876
(announcer)
A massive twist put the power

00:42.959 --> 00:46.087
in the hands
of the winning artist.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.840
(Dave)
You will form a jury of peers.

00:48.923 --> 00:50.884
You will pick two artists
to put up for elimination.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.969
{\an1}Guys, this isn't gonna
to be easy.

00:53.052 --> 00:55.972
The bottom, in my book,
would be Kito.

00:56.055 --> 00:57.432
{\an3}(St. Marq)
I don't agree about Kito.

00:57.515 --> 00:59.267
I'm leaning more
towards Earl's.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.310
{\an3}You can't tell
it's a rattlesnake.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.395
{\an1}That's a low blow,
and you know it.

01:02.479 --> 01:07.650
{\an5}(announcer)
Earl, Ryan, and Kito
had to face off to survive.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.861
Make sure you get that--
pew, pew.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.738
St. Marq is breathing down
the back of my neck.

01:11.821 --> 01:13.656
Yellow, yellow, yellow.

01:13.740 --> 01:14.866
{\an1}Your arms were just
in my way.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.659
{\an3}I was trying to save you
from yourself.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.119
{\an1}You don't think
it was [bleep] sabotage?

01:18.203 --> 01:21.039
{\an3}Did your brain fall
out of your ass[bleep]?

01:21.122 --> 01:23.750
{\an1}Earl, the outline is great
on this one.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.168
You really sunk it in there.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.920
- Kito...
- The little feathers shaded

01:27.003 --> 01:27.879
individually kind of gives it
that scale look.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.840
- Ryan...
- The stippling dot work

01:30.924 --> 01:34.010
{\an3}in the eagle's head--
that's not the best choice.

01:34.093 --> 01:36.221
I took in my critiques
from my master here.

01:36.304 --> 01:38.014
- So it's St. Marq's fault?
- It's every man for himself.

01:38.097 --> 01:39.766
{\an1}Why are you pointing
your fingers?

01:39.849 --> 01:40.683
{\an3}I didn't point
any fingers.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.894
Ryan, you do not have
what it takes

01:42.977 --> 01:44.646
to be Ink Master.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.068
(announcer)
16 artists remain,

01:50.151 --> 01:55.907
but only one will earn
a $100,000 prize

01:55.990 --> 01:58.535
and the title of Ink Master.

01:58.618 --> 02:02.455
{\an8}[rock music]

02:02.539 --> 02:10.547
{\an8}♪ ♪

02:58.428 --> 03:00.597
That, uh, went about
how I thought it was gonna go.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.224
Ryan went in there
with a bad attitude, as usual.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.976
{\an1}Like, he just didn't
[bleep] listen

03:05.059 --> 03:06.269
{\an1}the whole time
he was here.

03:06.352 --> 03:09.022
At this point, I have to look
out for no one but me.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.356
{\an8}Now I'm a mercenary.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.733
{\an8}I'm a lone wolf,

03:11.816 --> 03:14.611
{\an8}and I'm going to take it out
on everyone here.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.238
{\an1}Ryan showed us that how much
experience you have

03:17.322 --> 03:18.406
does not matter.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.116
So, for the people who have
been tattooing much longer,

03:20.199 --> 03:22.952
{\an1}since I have
the least experience,

03:23.036 --> 03:24.954
{\an1}the next challenge, like,
you could go home.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.582
{\an3}But Ryan doesn't listen,
so, I mean,

03:27.665 --> 03:29.083
with you experience
and my experience,

03:29.167 --> 03:30.627
we both do a tattoo,

03:30.710 --> 03:32.837
mine's probably gonna come out
a little bit better than yours.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.213
You don't know that.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.883
The outcome of this whole thing
is depending on the challenges.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.093
I don't personally think
that I'm better than any of you.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.137
I mean, nor do I.
I mean, you know--

03:41.220 --> 03:42.013
Except for me.

03:42.096 --> 03:44.223
{\an1}You literally
just said that, so...

03:44.307 --> 03:45.475
If it was between you and I,

03:45.558 --> 03:48.144
{\an3}they might as well just cut me
a check right now.

04:05.244 --> 04:08.665
Welcome to the Milstein Hall
of Ocean Life

04:08.748 --> 04:11.668
at the American Museum
of Natural History.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.672
16 of you remain.

04:15.755 --> 04:19.132
It's sink or swim...

04:19.216 --> 04:22.845
because only one of you
will walk away with $100,000,

04:22.929 --> 04:24.806
a feature in <i> Inked</i> magazine,

04:24.889 --> 04:28.017
and the title of Ink Master.

04:28.101 --> 04:31.145
And this week
you're being tested on contrast.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.230
{\an8}If your tattoo
doesn't have any contrast,

04:32.313 --> 04:35.525
{\an8}it's just gonna look like
a flat crayon design

04:35.608 --> 04:36.567
{\an8}on a piece of paper.

04:36.651 --> 04:37.944
{\an8}If you've got the deep blacks,

04:38.027 --> 04:39.362
{\an8}it's gonna give it
a lot of contrast

04:39.445 --> 04:40.655
{\an8}and give it some depth.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.865
{\an5}(Dave)
Now, this real-life,
epic battle scene

04:42.949 --> 04:45.451
depicts what happens
when a sperm whale

04:45.535 --> 04:50.081
and a giant squid
clash head-on.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.458
For centuries,
fishermen around the world

04:52.542 --> 04:55.837
have told legendary tales
of a fictitious sea monster

04:55.920 --> 04:57.547
similar to the giant squid--

04:57.630 --> 04:59.090
the Kraken.

04:59.173 --> 05:01.384
According to legend,
the Kraken wreaked havoc

05:01.467 --> 05:03.720
on tall ships
and rum-running vessels

05:03.803 --> 05:06.681
and had violent battles
with its natural enemies.

05:06.764 --> 05:09.684
Kraken Rum is named after
this mythical beast.

05:09.767 --> 05:13.312
Today your canvases
all want their own tattoo

05:13.396 --> 05:16.941
of the Kraken in battle
on their hands.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.402
Hands?

05:19.485 --> 05:22.238
{\an8}There's a long list of problems
with hand tattoos.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.990
Some hands are gonna swell
right away.

05:24.073 --> 05:27.076
You got veins, bones.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.120
There are totally different
factors when it comes to hands.

05:29.203 --> 05:33.916
And you must work
in teams of two,

05:34.000 --> 05:36.085
tattooing both
of your canvases' hands

05:36.169 --> 05:37.712
at the same time.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.088
- What?
- What?

05:39.172 --> 05:40.173
The Kraken must be
in black and gray

05:40.256 --> 05:43.259
while the enemy can be
in any color.

05:43.342 --> 05:45.094
You must use contrast
to make your design dynamic

05:45.178 --> 05:48.014
and the battle crystal clear.

05:48.097 --> 05:49.599
The winners
of the Flash Challenge

05:49.682 --> 05:52.018
will have the power to assign
all human canvases

05:52.101 --> 05:55.229
in the elimination tattoo
as a team.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.939
But that's not all.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.150
Kraken Rum is also
giving the winners

05:59.233 --> 06:02.487
an all-expense-paid trip to a
tattoo convention in Las Vegas,

06:02.570 --> 06:06.115
along with everything you need
to experience the city,

06:06.199 --> 06:08.910
from dinner and drinks
to tickets to shows.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.787
{\an8}I'm definitely going to need
a vacation

06:10.870 --> 06:13.414
{\an8}after this competition, so
I'll take that Las Vegas trip.

06:13.498 --> 06:18.169
And for the first time,
you will not be paired

06:18.252 --> 06:21.339
with your master
or apprentice.

06:21.422 --> 06:22.799
It's time to pick the teams.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.468
One by one, you will each
pick a skull.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.261
The number on the bottom
of your skull

06:27.345 --> 06:28.012
will determine the team.

06:28.096 --> 06:32.016
Kito, you're up first.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.352
Eight.

06:34.435 --> 06:36.437
- Three.
- Number seven.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.481
- Eight.
- Got this.

06:38.564 --> 06:39.649
{\an8}Teamwork challenges
are very important,

06:39.732 --> 06:42.443
{\an8}because when you tattoo someone,
you're basically doing

06:42.527 --> 06:44.821
{\an8}a collaboration with every other
tattoo artist

06:44.904 --> 06:46.739
{\an8}- that's ever worked on it.
- Two.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.199
It you can't work with other
artists for the benefit

06:48.282 --> 06:50.660
- of the canvas...
- Number five.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.204
You're not gonna stay
in business very long.

06:53.287 --> 06:55.331
- Three.
- Hey.

06:55.414 --> 06:58.084
{\an8}I pair up with Marisa.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.336
{\an8}She still isn't experienced.

07:00.419 --> 07:01.838
{\an8}I know it's going to be
a struggle.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.006
{\an8}Two.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.092
{\an8}I've been training
my whole life to be a leader.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.219
{\an8}I'm an Eagle Scout,
I'm a Marine.

07:08.302 --> 07:09.929
Give me anybody--I'm gonna still
make 'em rise to the top.

07:10.012 --> 07:12.640
- Four
- Number one.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.226
- Four.
- Number five.

07:15.309 --> 07:17.520
[clicks tongue]

07:17.603 --> 07:20.189
One.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.482
Number seven.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.402
{\an8}Two masters on one team--
I could do a lot worse.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.070
{\an8}I really want to go
to Vegas.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.280
{\an8}We're going to win
this competition.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.532
{\an8}- Number six.
- Six.

07:29.615 --> 07:30.783
{\an8}(Kruseman)
I hope this kid can bring
his A game

07:30.867 --> 07:33.870
{\an8}because I'm ready to get in
there and get this thing done

07:33.953 --> 07:35.163
{\an8}and make it awesome.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.874
Okay, teams are set.
Let's go meet your canvases.

07:45.673 --> 07:47.216
- Marisa. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.051
- MV. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, bro.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.636
{\an8}Two artists have to work
together as a team

07:50.720 --> 07:53.639
{\an8}and tattoo one canvas's
two hands at the same time.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.474
{\an1}You ever get a tag-team
tattoo before?

07:55.558 --> 07:56.934
- Never, bro.
- [chuckles]

07:57.018 --> 07:59.729
These two hands have to
go together as one tattoo.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.731
{\an1}I was thinking I could maybe do
the black-and-gray part.

08:01.814 --> 08:02.732
You could do the color.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.400
{\an8}Turning it into
a battle scene

08:04.483 --> 08:07.069
{\an8}with another fictitious animal
is gonna be pretty tough.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.322
{\an8}- What are we fighting?
- A snake.

08:09.405 --> 08:10.281
{\an9}A snake?

08:10.364 --> 08:11.324
{\an8}(Earl)
My canvas, surprisingly,

08:11.407 --> 08:14.577
{\an8}wants a Kraken
versus a snake.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.079
{\an3}I like the idea of the fangs
protruding coming out.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.664
I think it would be good
for me to do the snake.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.374
[laughing]
I agree.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.293
I don't understand what's
happening with the snake.

08:22.376 --> 08:23.961
{\an1}(Oliver)
Did you forget the teeth?

08:24.045 --> 08:25.463
I totally
did not put teeth in it.

08:25.546 --> 08:29.342
{\an3}I'm excited about this.
Let's rock and roll.

08:29.425 --> 08:33.554
Three hours left,
three more hours.

08:33.638 --> 08:34.722
You're gonna need
some background

08:34.804 --> 08:35.597
to create some contrast,
you know what I mean?

08:35.681 --> 08:37.600
You're not going to have
any contrast

08:37.683 --> 08:38.601
if you fill it up
like that.

08:38.683 --> 08:39.977
{\an8}Just follow my lead, man.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.895
{\an8}I want you to do
exactly what I say.

08:41.979 --> 08:43.813
{\an8}It should be black,
you know what I mean?

08:43.898 --> 08:45.524
{\an8}- Contrast, contrast, contrast.
- Right.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.692
{\an8}I know St. Marq
can do contrast

08:46.776 --> 08:47.485
{\an8}because he won't shut up.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.611
That black background
will be

08:48.694 --> 08:50.363
the hardest contrast
in the whole thing.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.448
(Miami)
I just want to go to Vegas.

08:52.531 --> 08:53.449
We don't have time to argue.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.076
{\an1}(St. Marq)
The contrast, keep that in mind.

08:55.159 --> 08:58.162
Shut the [bleep] up.

08:59.747 --> 09:02.959
Shark tail will kind of
come together right there.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.670
{\an1}So we want this tentacle
to back up this way?

09:05.753 --> 09:07.255
{\an5}(Chris B)
Erik's just working along
with me.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.799
I'm just telling him,
"Hey, do this, do that."

09:09.882 --> 09:10.967
{\an8}I like to work alone.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.802
{\an8}I like to win alone.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.471
I'm gonna pull, like,
a mid-blue around his head,

09:15.554 --> 09:16.973
and then I'll pull back
the light blue

09:17.056 --> 09:17.807
so I reach you
at the same time.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.017
I'm gonna take
the leadership role,

09:20.101 --> 09:22.478
whether he wants me there
or not.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.940
One hour remains.
Final hour.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.733
{\an5}(Marisa)
What are you doing with the
little suction cups?

09:27.817 --> 09:33.322
I am just putting a super-light
wash shading over them.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.490
{\an8}I'm the female front-runner
in this competition.

09:34.573 --> 09:37.326
You think you'll have time
to do a little bit

09:37.410 --> 09:39.495
- of mint behind it?
- Yeah.

09:39.578 --> 09:42.331
I have to monitor Marisa's
tattoo to make sure

09:42.415 --> 09:43.666
that we can win this.

09:43.749 --> 09:44.875
{\an3}(Oliver)
Holy mackerel.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.669
That one's got to hurt.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.338
{\an3}You're gonna do
your tentacles last, right?

09:49.422 --> 09:51.299
- Yep, so I can see yours.
- Yeah.

09:51.382 --> 09:52.341
(Kruseman)
Dave is doing a sperm whale.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.510
It looks like a shoe box
with an eyeball on it.

09:54.593 --> 09:55.678
{\an8}It doesn't even look
like a whale to me.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.555
{\an3}I think it's a nice, little
playful whale.

09:57.638 --> 10:00.850
He's gonna make me
look like a fool up there.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.852
(Dave)
Five, four,

10:02.935 --> 10:06.022
three, two, one.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.982
That is it.
Machines down.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.358
Time is up,
no more ink.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.236
- That's rad, huh?
- Awesome.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.446
We are done with this lady.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.073
{\an8}What are St. Marq and Miami
thinking

10:16.157 --> 10:19.201
{\an8}doing two solid black hand
tattoos on a soccer mom?

10:19.285 --> 10:19.702
That looks terrible.

10:23.706 --> 10:24.749
(Dave)
All right, artists.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.208
It's time to critique
your work.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.420
{\an8}Katie and Marisa,
you're up first.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.672
{\an8}(Katie)
I did the Kraken,
Marisa did the shark.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.174
{\an8}(Oliver)
As far as contrast goes,

10:33.257 --> 10:34.967
{\an8}I think the light highlights
in the Kraken

10:35.051 --> 10:36.927
{\an8}against the dark black--
very, very nice.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.679
{\an8}The shark
is a little more rough.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.307
{\an8}There's not a lot of vibrancy
that really makes it stand out.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.893
{\an8}(Dave)
Earl and Duffy.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.186
{\an8}From a few feet away,

10:45.269 --> 10:47.229
{\an8}it's very difficult to tell
what's going on.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.732
{\an8}(Duffy)
It was hard to find a happy
medium with the background,

10:49.815 --> 10:52.068
{\an8}being that it's supposed to be,
like, a dark scene.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.237
{\an9}(Chris)
Darker blues on darker skin
kills the contrast.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.406
{\an9}Earl, as far as your snake,
it's more of a fish.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.909
{\an8}(Oliver)
It's a big head and just
a bunch of coils behind it.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.328
{\an8}(Kito)
Damn, Earl, you need to stay
away from these snakes.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.455
{\an8}Go ahead and put it
to rest.

11:04.538 --> 11:05.456
{\an8}(Dave)
Erik and Chris.

11:05.539 --> 11:06.332
{\an8}(Oliver)
A lot of contrast on both sides

11:06.415 --> 11:09.126
{\an8}of the fence,
and very legible.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.921
{\an8}It's one of the best drawn
tattoos we've seen today.

11:12.004 --> 11:15.299
{\an8}(Dave)
You created a whole underwater
scene happening here.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.802
{\an8}Very cool, guys.

11:17.885 --> 11:18.886
{\an8}MV and Kito.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.429
{\an8}(MV)
We went with a dark water

11:20.513 --> 11:21.597
{\an8}and then, in contrast,

11:21.680 --> 11:23.766
{\an8}a really bright orange
for the background.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.101
{\an8}I don't think
it's that bright.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.103
{\an8}It goes from a darker tone
from this side

11:27.186 --> 11:28.604
{\an8}up to a lighter tone
on this side.

11:28.687 --> 11:31.023
{\an8}(Oliver)
I don't think it adds much
contrast to his skin.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.442
{\an9}Oh, we thought we hit it
with the contrast.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.277
{\an8}(Dave)
Miami and St. Marq.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.654
{\an8}You guys are two masters.
How was it working together?

11:36.737 --> 11:39.865
{\an8}We really brought the best
out of each other.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.867
{\an9}(Chris)
Technically, they're two
strong tattoos.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.953
{\an9}You have some very
dark areas to contrast

11:44.036 --> 11:46.747
{\an9}with the tentacle section
you have up in the foreground.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.542
{\an9}St. Marq, I do like leaving
that front tentacle

11:49.625 --> 11:50.668
{\an8}with no detail
and just having

11:50.751 --> 11:53.295
{\an9}the small suckers
all the way up.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.338
{\an8}Very strong design.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.590
{\an8}(Dave)
Craig and Tyler.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.634
{\an8}(Oliver)
Overall, they're strong tattoos.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.886
{\an8}The shark really stands out
and looks strong--

12:00.970 --> 12:01.929
{\an8}a lot of contrast.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.514
{\an8}My problem with the Kraken--

12:03.597 --> 12:05.224
{\an8}it's hard to see
what's going on.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.810
{\an8}You overshaded, so you lose
some of the contrast.

12:07.893 --> 12:08.936
{\an8}(Chris B)
Tyler's my apprentice.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.479
{\an8}He did exactly
what I thought he'd do.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.314
{\an8}It's just flat.
It's boring.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.692
{\an8}(Dave)
Matt and Big Ceeze.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.902
{\an9}I can definitely see
what both of the objects are.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.822
{\an9}The gorilla could have used
a much heavier outline

12:19.905 --> 12:20.739
{\an8}and a lot more black.

12:20.823 --> 12:21.991
{\an9}On darker skin,
more use of black,

12:22.074 --> 12:26.579
{\an9}less use of gray is always
what's gonna last the longest.

12:26.662 --> 12:27.997
{\an8}(Dave)
Kruseman and Dave.

12:28.080 --> 12:28.581
{\an8}(Oliver)
I like these tattoos.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.416
{\an8}They're simple and bold.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.418
{\an8}The thing that's just
bugging me

12:32.501 --> 12:34.962
{\an8}is the ending of the whale
on the knuckles.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.547
{\an8}The eye is outlined
and finished out,

12:36.630 --> 12:39.467
{\an8}but the shading stops
higher than that.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.177
{\an8}That's bugging me.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.511
{\an8}My part looks awesome.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.221
{\an8}I could strangle
Dave Clarke right now.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.598
{\an8}He has 100% taken away
the chance

12:45.681 --> 12:47.933
{\an8}of me getting
my first skull pick.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.813
It's gonna be a good
old-fashioned chick fight.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.483
Grow a pair of balls
and just [bleep] tattoo.

12:55.566 --> 12:58.277
{\an3}Don't cut the details
that I want.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.070
I had to keep my composure,
'cause if I don't come up

13:00.154 --> 13:01.238
with something,
this guy's gonna leave.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.199
God bless it, Almighty.
What a struggle.

13:08.829 --> 13:12.208
All right, guys,
today we're testing contrast.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.960
Let's start with Katie
and Marisa.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.713
{\an9}Katie did one of the nicer
tattoos of the day, actually.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.381
{\an8}I really did like
the details

13:19.465 --> 13:21.759
{\an8}in the head of the Kraken
that did show

13:21.842 --> 13:22.593
{\an8}a really nice use
of contrast.

13:22.676 --> 13:26.138
{\an7}I felt like Marisa's
was very messy.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.306
{\an8}It was a struggle for her

13:27.389 --> 13:29.141
{\an7}to try to keep up
with what Katie was doing.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.435
{\an8}- Right.
- Kruseman and Dave.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.896
{\an9}Where the tattoo fell short
as a team

13:33.979 --> 13:35.064
{\an9}was definitely in the whale
with the weaker outline,

13:35.147 --> 13:39.568
{\an9}as opposed to Kruseman's
very strong, tough tentacles.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.863
If one tattoo is great and the
other one isn't as strong,

13:42.947 --> 13:45.074
does that affect our choice
for the win?

13:45.157 --> 13:46.408
{\an1}Yes.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.868
{\an1}It's got to be
the two strongest

13:47.952 --> 13:50.079
- go together tattoo.
- Yeah.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.330
{\an8}Erik and Chris
are in the front.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.706
{\an8}It's just well drawn.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.583
{\an8}Yeah, I liked
the blast of color.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.753
{\an8}I thought it created
a nice, seamless scene.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.713
It's pretty clear
who the winner is today.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.799
- Yeah.
- Want to go let 'em know?

14:01.882 --> 14:01.924
Let's do it.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.429
Today you had to show contrast

14:07.513 --> 14:12.101
by tattooing the Kraken
locked in battle with an enemy.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.394
The judges have decided.

14:13.477 --> 14:16.188
The winners of today's
Flash Challenge are...

14:18.566 --> 14:21.986
Erik and Chris.

14:22.069 --> 14:23.445
{\an8}(Oliver)
Very clear, strong imagery

14:23.529 --> 14:25.948
{\an8}mimicking each other's style.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.533
Very well technically
applied.

14:27.616 --> 14:29.243
- Thank you.
- Erik and Chris...

14:29.326 --> 14:32.121
You will have the power
to assign all human canvases

14:32.204 --> 14:34.790
for the elimination tattoo
as a team.

14:34.873 --> 14:37.209
{\an8}We have the power
to assign the skulls,

14:37.293 --> 14:38.669
{\an8}and I'm ready to just
start rocking.

14:38.752 --> 14:42.131
{\an8}And Kraken Rum is giving you
an all-expense-paid trip

14:42.214 --> 14:45.426
{\an8}to one of the country's
top tattoo conventions.

14:45.509 --> 14:46.844
{\an8}Marisa and I should have had
the win.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.804
{\an8}We had
the most interesting design.

14:48.887 --> 14:50.222
I don't think it's fair.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.141
Head back to the loft
and prepare

14:52.224 --> 14:54.435
for you next
elimination tattoo.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.315
- First skull pick.
- We got the power.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.984
{\an3}Strategy-wise, I think we should
just call everybody out.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.278
{\an3}This is the way to find out
who's full of [bleep].

15:04.361 --> 15:06.155
{\an8}I'm definitely going to start
picking my targets

15:06.238 --> 15:07.281
{\an8}to start knocking off.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.158
{\an1}One person that I think
hasn't been showing

15:09.241 --> 15:10.701
{\an1}what they're capable of
is MV.

15:10.784 --> 15:11.994
{\an1}He's the one I'm gunning for
right now.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.495
- The guy can draw.
- Yeah, I know that.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.164
{\an3}So, if you're looking at it
from the standpoint

15:15.247 --> 15:18.834
of, "I don't want this guy
in the end to go against,"

15:18.917 --> 15:20.961
{\an3}then singling him out now
would definitely be

15:21.045 --> 15:21.712
one strategy to go with.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.839
{\an1}If he doesn't bring it
this time,

15:23.922 --> 15:25.007
{\an1}then I think he's got
to go home.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.564
Welcome
to the Elimination Tattoo.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.857
As you're learning,
in this competition,

15:41.940 --> 15:44.318
the slightest misstep
could cost you your shot

15:44.401 --> 15:45.819
at $100,000,

15:45.903 --> 15:48.489
a feature in <i> Inked</i> magazine,

15:48.572 --> 15:52.034
and most importantly,
the title of Ink Master.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.078
This week
we're testing contrast.

15:54.161 --> 15:57.706
{\an8}Contrast is the ability
to use lights and darks

15:57.790 --> 15:59.041
{\an8}or opposing colors

15:59.124 --> 16:01.001
{\an8}to really make
your design pop.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.754
Today you must create...

16:06.006 --> 16:07.216
A stained-glass tattoo.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.927
{\an8}Oh.

16:10.010 --> 16:13.305
{\an8}What the [bleep] is
a stained-glass tattoo?

16:13.389 --> 16:14.515
{\an8}Damn.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.100
{\an8}I've never done
a stained-glass tattoo

16:16.183 --> 16:17.309
{\an8}in the 17 years
that I've been tattooing.

16:17.393 --> 16:21.563
This popular style consists
of brightly colored images

16:21.647 --> 16:23.649
broken up by black lines
to mimic the look

16:23.732 --> 16:26.235
or actual stained glass.

16:26.318 --> 16:30.739
{\an8}These dumb boys are buggin'
over stained-glass tattoos?

16:30.823 --> 16:33.951
Grow a pair of balls
and just [bleep] tattoo.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.744
(Dave)
In this Elimination Tattoo,

16:35.828 --> 16:37.913
you must tattoo
the same subject

16:37.996 --> 16:40.749
head-to-head
against another artist.

16:43.043 --> 16:46.463
You will be directly
compared and critiqued.

16:46.547 --> 16:50.259
{\an8}One of you will win,
and one of you will lose.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.135
{\an8}Color contrast--

16:51.218 --> 16:51.760
{\an8}this is what I do
really well.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.971
There's not one person

16:54.054 --> 16:56.014
that I'd be worried
about going head-to-head with.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.891
(Dave)
Let's meet your canvases.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.981
Chris and Erik,
you won the Flash Challenge.

17:04.064 --> 17:07.025
You now have the power to assign
all human canvases together.

17:07.108 --> 17:09.569
{\an8}By assigning the skulls,
you're also determining

17:09.653 --> 17:13.156
{\an8}who tattoos head-to-head.

17:13.240 --> 17:16.660
This is a huge advantage.

17:16.743 --> 17:18.328
{\an1}What would you like
to get tattooed today?

17:18.412 --> 17:19.204
{\an3}A stained-glass skull
on my thigh.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.498
A stained-glass skull
on my ribs.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.752
[bleep].

17:24.835 --> 17:28.422
{\an8}Always the least favorite area
anyone wants to tattoo.

17:28.505 --> 17:29.840
I don't want this one.

17:29.923 --> 17:31.508
Erik better hook me up.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.926
What would you like
to get tattooed today?

17:33.010 --> 17:34.470
{\an3}A stained-glass bird
on my chest.

17:34.553 --> 17:35.512
A stained-glass bird
on my hip.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.265
{\an8}Having the skull pick
is kind of bittersweet.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.017
It makes you a target
in the future

17:40.100 --> 17:42.060
if you give somebody something
that they don't want to do.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.562
What would you like
to get tattooed today?

17:43.645 --> 17:44.772
{\an3}I'm gonna get
a stained-glass window

17:44.855 --> 17:46.148
{\an3}with a cross
right in the middle.

17:47.441 --> 17:51.570
My only strategy at this point
is to try to keep myself safe.

17:51.653 --> 17:55.699
{\an3}I would like to get
a stained-glass carousel circus.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.451
- Oh.
- What?

17:57.534 --> 17:58.327
A stained-glass carousel.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.828
{\an8}I damn sure don't want
no carousel.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.330
{\an8}I can't even picture
how the hell

18:01.413 --> 18:05.626
{\an8}a damn carousel is going to look
in stained-glass form.

18:05.709 --> 18:06.543
{\an8}Being a Marine,
I like to take charge.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.629
{\an8}I like to be a leader.

18:08.712 --> 18:10.464
Who do you want to
give this one to?

18:10.547 --> 18:11.590
So I'm running
the whole thing.

18:14.218 --> 18:17.012
I have a strategy, and I have
a plan to stick to.

18:18.430 --> 18:22.392
{\an3}Canvases, one by one,
please read the artist's name

18:22.476 --> 18:23.769
on the bottom of your skull.

18:23.852 --> 18:25.646
Big Ceeze.

18:25.729 --> 18:27.314
- Craig.
- [chuckles]

18:27.397 --> 18:28.857
{\an8}I'm going against Craig.

18:28.941 --> 18:32.361
{\an8}He's really great with color,
and I'm a black-and-gray artist.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.529
{\an8}It's gonna be tough.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.490
{\an8}- MV.
- Chris.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.242
{\an8}I'm going after MV
right now.

18:38.325 --> 18:39.159
I'm gonna take him on
head-to-head

18:39.243 --> 18:41.203
so that I can put him
at the bottom

18:41.286 --> 18:43.539
and knock him out
of the competition.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.457
Erik.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.750
Tyler.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.838
Marisa.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.137
- Earl.
- Ooh.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.516
{\an8}I keep getting thrown
the [bleep] canvas.

19:03.976 --> 19:04.893
{\an7}(Earl)
Yay.

19:04.977 --> 19:05.978
{\an8}Earl's been at the bottom,

19:06.061 --> 19:08.772
{\an8}and I haven't,
so it's a good matchup.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.691
Kito.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.150
Matt.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.737
A carousel.

19:15.821 --> 19:19.116
{\an8}- Kruseman.
- Ooh.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.913
{\an8}- Miami.
- That's me.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.332
{\an8}An effing carousel
made out of stained glass--

19:27.416 --> 19:29.751
That's like trying to fit
five gallons worth of [bleep]

19:29.835 --> 19:30.627
in a one-gallon bucket.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.755
St. Marq.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.216
Dave.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.926
Katie.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.012
Duffy.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.221
- Girl fight.
- Reeer!

19:41.305 --> 19:42.681
{\an8}I'm taking Katie down.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.099
Okay, artists, remember

19:44.182 --> 19:45.767
after the Elimination Tattoo,

19:45.851 --> 19:48.103
{\an3}the human-canvas jury
will vote on the tattoo

19:48.186 --> 19:49.605
{\an3}that they think
is the worst

19:49.688 --> 19:51.690
and put one artist
up for elimination.

19:51.773 --> 19:55.819
{\an3}You'll have six hours to create
a stained-glass tattoo.

19:55.903 --> 19:59.114
{\an3}Based on your work,
one of you will close shop.

19:59.197 --> 20:00.073
[sighs]

20:00.157 --> 20:01.450
{\an3}Good luck.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.368
[bleep], yeah.
Lighthouse, right?

20:03.452 --> 20:04.870
{\an8}(Chris)
With stained-glass tattoos,

20:04.953 --> 20:06.914
{\an8}strong black outlines are going
to be a 100% necessity

20:06.997 --> 20:09.291
{\an8}and will add
to the contrast.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.627
{\an1}Because it's stained glass,
it's more geometric.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.170
If these artists don't depict
the proper contrast,

20:13.253 --> 20:16.131
it just feels more like
color by numbers.

20:16.214 --> 20:17.925
I don't know how you're gonna
sit for your ribs that long.

20:18.008 --> 20:18.842
{\an3}Are you excited?
Nervous?

20:18.926 --> 20:20.969
- Excited.
- Good.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.888
I just want you to have
a good [bleep] tattoo.

20:22.971 --> 20:24.973
{\an4}Do you have anything
on your thighs?
Those are moneymakers.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.684
- You good at color tattoo?
- Yes, sir.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.395
{\an1}I do like what you're
doing there. That's crazy.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.939
- You want a cross, right?
- Yeah.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.106
{\an3}I'm just wondering
what kind of colors.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.151
{\an1}If you don't want color, bro,
we can just do black lines

20:36.234 --> 20:37.653
{\an1}and then do something
like a light shade.

20:37.736 --> 20:38.820
{\an3}I'm definitely down
with that.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.364
{\an8}Bright colors just don't
stand out on dark skin,

20:40.447 --> 20:43.158
{\an8}so I'm gonna give him
a black-and-gray tattoo.

20:43.241 --> 20:44.034
That's what I specialize in.

20:44.117 --> 20:46.828
I think that'll be
pretty cool, man.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.830
{\an1}You could always do, like,
the back of your leg

20:48.914 --> 20:49.831
{\an1}if you wanted to,
you know what I mean?

20:49.915 --> 20:52.292
{\an1}That way, you could lay down
and be comfortable.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.336
{\an3}My theme is a carousel,
but I don't want a simple horse.

20:54.419 --> 20:58.090
I want something, like,
goth, dark, from hell.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.509
{\an1}But keep in mind, too, it's got
to be stained glass as well.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.177
{\an8}I'm having a hard time
understanding

21:02.260 --> 21:04.137
{\an8}exactly what my canvas
is really wanting.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.348
{\an3}One line
of stained glass here.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.933
Cut the body, like,
in four parts only.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.477
I'm getting really pissed.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.353
{\an3}Don't cut the details
that I want.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.354
If I don't come up
with something,

21:12.437 --> 21:15.023
this guy's gonna leave,
and I'll be damned

21:15.107 --> 21:18.318
if I'm gonna put a stained-glass
carousel horse on my leg.

21:28.787 --> 21:29.454
You got your cross?

21:29.538 --> 21:30.998
- Doing that thing?
- Yeah.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.708
{\an1}I'm gonna do it
black and gray, man.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.876
{\an3}Really? You have to do it
with color.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.461
{\an1}There is black-and-gray
stained glass.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.547
{\an3}You got to think
about the challenge.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.383
Big Ceeze, you're [bleep]
shooting yourself in the head

21:41.466 --> 21:42.884
if you think
that you're gonna get away

21:42.968 --> 21:44.469
with doing
a black-and-gray tattoo.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.514
{\an1}I'd rather just play it safe
and just do it black and gray.

21:47.597 --> 21:50.392
We'll see what happens.

21:50.475 --> 21:54.021
Artists, you have six hours
to prove contrast.

21:54.104 --> 21:58.066
Your time begins...

21:58.150 --> 21:59.860
now.

21:59.943 --> 22:00.944
{\an8}Boom, bitch.

22:02.237 --> 22:03.447
{\an8}(Oliver)
When you think of stained glass,

22:03.530 --> 22:05.532
{\an8}you think of the sun shining
through bright colors

22:05.615 --> 22:06.116
{\an8}and making a dynamic image.

22:06.199 --> 22:06.992
All right, you ready?

22:07.075 --> 22:08.243
But what we're looking for

22:08.326 --> 22:11.788
is that the contrast
enhances the image.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.415
And if you can't meet up
to that, it's time to go home.

22:19.546 --> 22:22.632
{\an1}I think I'm gonna stick
with some turquoises and greens.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.427
{\an8}I specialize in saturating.
I specialize in bright colors.

22:25.510 --> 22:26.678
This is right down
my alley.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.430
{\an1}I decided to go
head-to-head with MV.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.140
- Playing the game?
- I don't think he's really been

22:30.223 --> 22:31.141
{\an1}challenged too much,
and MV's a damn good artist.

22:31.224 --> 22:33.727
{\an1}You're looking
for Ink Master, right?

22:33.810 --> 22:34.936
I know I won this challenge

22:35.020 --> 22:36.271
just because I'm already
in MV's head.

22:36.354 --> 22:37.522
I got him rattled.

22:37.606 --> 22:38.940
I'm putting the nail
in your coffin right now.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.485
{\an1}How does it look?
Good?

22:41.568 --> 22:44.821
- We all love a pretty face.
[both laugh]

22:44.905 --> 22:46.698
{\an1}I know I got
a lot of way to go, so...

22:46.782 --> 22:47.741
Go big or go home.

22:47.824 --> 22:50.952
{\an8}Chris gives me
the angel tattoo against him.

22:51.036 --> 22:51.787
Is he calling me out?

22:51.870 --> 22:53.789
Does he think
he can beat me?

22:53.872 --> 22:55.123
All these small details.

22:55.207 --> 22:55.832
All I can do
is prove him wrong.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.959
That looks cool.

22:59.377 --> 23:00.670
{\an1}You're acting like
I'm [bleep] hurting you.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.589
{\an3}Oh, man.

23:02.672 --> 23:05.300
{\an3}Thank you for talking me
out of the ribs.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.302
{\an8}Luckily, I convinced my canvas
to move the tattoo

23:07.385 --> 23:09.554
{\an8}from his ribs to his leg.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.807
{\an1}This is the point where you're
either going to puke

23:11.890 --> 23:13.100
or you're gonna love it.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.519
- How is it?
- I have a high pain tolerance.

23:15.602 --> 23:16.520
Girls are tough.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.688
Marisa is definitely
not a threat.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.316
I'm going to win
this [bleep] competition.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.822
Three hours to go,
three more hours.

23:26.905 --> 23:27.864
{\an3}We'll be working on this one
to the wire.

23:27.948 --> 23:30.534
{\an1}I love the textures
in the glass and everything.

23:30.617 --> 23:33.495
{\an8}Yeah, we're going for...

23:33.578 --> 23:36.665
{\an5}(St. Marq)
Chris and Erik
put me head-to-head

23:36.748 --> 23:37.791
against Dave Clarke.

23:37.874 --> 23:40.001
{\an8}So I guess they want Dave Clarke
gone right now.

23:40.085 --> 23:41.211
I grew up in a church.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.046
I've made stained glass.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.090
They are not gonna know
what hit them.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.758
I have several ministers
in my family.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.844
That's kind of
the family business.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.470
When I decided to become
a tattooist,

23:50.554 --> 23:52.097
I knew that I would have
some resistance.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.682
It made me overachieve.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.058
I'm not gonna be
a tattooist.

23:55.142 --> 23:58.103
I'm gonna be the best tattooist
in the whole world.

24:00.522 --> 24:00.564
No one.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.361
{\an1}'Cause they're testing
for contrast.

24:06.444 --> 24:08.822
{\an8}The way I plan to show contrast
is to make sure

24:08.905 --> 24:09.489
{\an8}that there's lots
of heavy black in there

24:09.573 --> 24:11.324
{\an8}and lots of bright colors.

24:16.454 --> 24:17.998
I'm gonna totally
crush Miami.

24:18.081 --> 24:19.499
Hands down,
my style of tattooing

24:19.583 --> 24:21.835
is gonna translate
into a stained-glass window

24:21.918 --> 24:23.670
way better than his.

24:23.753 --> 24:25.380
{\an3}What are you gonna do
in there?

24:25.463 --> 24:27.132
'Cause that looks like that's
gonna require a lot of work.

24:27.215 --> 24:28.341
{\an5}(Miami)
It's gonna require
a lot of work.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.011
My canvas came in
with a million ideas.

24:31.094 --> 24:33.388
{\an8}God bless it, Almighty.
What a struggle.

24:33.471 --> 24:35.390
I might not be doing
totally stained glass,

24:35.473 --> 24:38.018
but hopefully all this [bleep]
wins me some points.

24:38.101 --> 24:39.895
One of the things
that they need to school you on

24:39.978 --> 24:41.229
is dealing with clients.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.065
I'm gonna get a lot of points
for this one.

24:44.149 --> 24:47.527
{\an8}First time I ever saw Miami
was in jail.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.071
{\an5}(Miami)
It started
with my mom passing away.

24:50.155 --> 24:50.864
It was a real bad time.

24:50.947 --> 24:52.741
I did the drugs
and the drinking

24:52.824 --> 24:55.368
and all that stuff
to get my mind off of my mom.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.078
But I took a negative
and made it a positive.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.539
I came out of there sober,
a different person.

25:03.501 --> 25:05.086
Miami mentored me.

25:05.170 --> 25:08.381
It's almost like you're being
adopted by a father,

25:08.465 --> 25:11.134
and Miami will always be held
in regard

25:11.218 --> 25:13.762
as that person who taught me
how to tattoo.

25:13.845 --> 25:16.514
I'm definitely worried
about Miami and his tattoo.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.892
One hour left,
one hour remaining.

25:24.481 --> 25:26.399
{\an8}Color isn't my biggest
strong point.

25:26.483 --> 25:27.901
{\an8}I got to find a way
to make this pop.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.277
Opaque gray is a good call.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.779
{\an1}Well, that's kind of the color
he wanted.

25:30.862 --> 25:31.488
{\an3}Looks like he's doing
all right.

25:31.571 --> 25:34.157
- Chillin'.
- [laughing]

25:34.241 --> 25:36.826
{\an5}(Kito)
I plan to show contrast
by doing a light-blue sky,

25:36.910 --> 25:38.536
and the red moon
is gonna set off

25:38.620 --> 25:39.955
a lot of contrast
in this piece.

25:40.038 --> 25:40.705
Matt might think
he can beat me,

25:40.789 --> 25:42.666
but I got tricks
up my sleeve.

25:46.544 --> 25:50.131
(Dave)
Five, four, three,

25:50.215 --> 25:52.342
two, one.

25:52.425 --> 25:53.468
That's it.
Time is up.

25:53.551 --> 25:55.345
Machines down.
No more ink.

25:55.428 --> 25:57.222
All right, we're done.

25:57.305 --> 25:57.973
{\an4}(woman)
Oh, my God,
that is awesome.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.475
You like it?

26:00.558 --> 26:02.310
{\an1}Wow. Dope.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.396
Damn, man, I think that [bleep]
looks a little off-center.

26:04.479 --> 26:06.147
You know, I'm in
your corner right now.

26:06.231 --> 26:07.232
We're not going
head-to-head.

26:07.315 --> 26:08.483
I want you to prevail,

26:08.566 --> 26:10.819
but it seems like you're making
all the odds against you.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.529
Come, on, Ceeze, baby.

26:12.612 --> 26:15.240
{\an3}I would be second-guessing
my approach.

26:15.323 --> 26:16.324
I'm definitely not
going to go home.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.493
{\an1}If you can't meet the challenge,
you're going home.

26:18.576 --> 26:20.829
{\an3}I've come here
to prove a point.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.580
{\an1}You think you put
more of your heart into it?

26:22.664 --> 26:24.207
{\an3}[bleep], yeah, I put
my [bleep] heart into it.

26:31.172 --> 26:33.341
{\an1}If I were you, I would be
second-guessing my approach.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.176
{\an3}That's crazy, bro,
how you think that way.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.762
- I did a good tattoo.
- It didn't meet the challenge.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.222
{\an5}(Miami)
I mean, it was black and gray.
It was a color challenge.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.266
It's in the bottom for me.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.018
{\an3}I'm definitely not
gonna go home.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.352
Big Ceeze's tattoo
is horrible.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.688
The mother[bleep] was not
even on his back straight.

26:46.771 --> 26:49.524
It's his time to go home.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.205
Today you had to use contrast

27:04.289 --> 27:07.083
to make vibrant
stained-glass tattoos.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.209
Each of you tattooed
head-to-head

27:08.293 --> 27:10.378
with another artist.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.172
We will directly compare
your work.

27:12.255 --> 27:14.591
Craig, start with you.

27:14.674 --> 27:17.969
You went head-to-head
with Big Ceeze.

27:18.053 --> 27:20.722
I love the brick work
around this thing,

27:20.805 --> 27:22.223
and I love all the intricate
little shapes that you have

27:22.307 --> 27:24.225
in these rays.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.227
{\an3}The hot and cold
color palate hits the mark

27:26.311 --> 27:27.062
of the contrast.

27:27.145 --> 27:28.480
{\an3}I know you're
a heavy color guy.

27:28.563 --> 27:31.149
{\an3}These pastel colors--
ramp 'em up.

27:31.232 --> 27:35.028
The power that gets lost
is just the color palate.

27:35.111 --> 27:38.740
Big Ceeze.

27:38.823 --> 27:40.283
You went black and gray here.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.577
I went black and gray,
'cause trying to do contrast

27:42.660 --> 27:44.537
with dark skin
is pretty hard.

27:44.621 --> 27:46.790
{\an4}(Oliver)
If I was gonna have to do
something with contrast,

27:46.873 --> 27:47.332
{\an1}I would try
to show depth.

27:47.415 --> 27:50.043
You didn't do that.

27:50.126 --> 27:52.504
And when I came to your room
and saw the tattoo in person,

27:52.587 --> 27:54.255
{\an1}I was like, "Man, that thing
don't look straight."

27:54.339 --> 27:56.800
{\an1}This thing is off
by more than an inch.

27:56.883 --> 27:58.551
I mean, I-I thought
it looked pretty good.

27:58.635 --> 28:02.055
It's just crooked, man.

28:02.138 --> 28:05.183
{\an8}Let's debate a win
between Big Ceeze and Craig.

28:05.266 --> 28:07.435
{\an7}Craig's tattoo--
there's definitely contrast.

28:07.519 --> 28:08.895
{\an7}Definitely
stained-glass window.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.605
- I'm going with Craig.
- Craig.

28:10.688 --> 28:12.273
The winner of the head-to-head
challenge is Craig.

28:12.357 --> 28:15.360
Congratulations.

28:15.443 --> 28:17.153
Katie.

28:17.237 --> 28:19.364
You went head-to-head
with Duffy.

28:19.447 --> 28:20.281
It looks heavy.
It looks solid.

28:20.365 --> 28:23.118
{\an3}It looks bold.
It's bright.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.452
It has consistency.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.539
{\an3}The color saturation
and color theory you used here

28:27.622 --> 28:28.998
{\an3}are strong.

28:29.082 --> 28:32.127
Duffy.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.420
This thing looks great.

28:33.503 --> 28:35.463
{\an1}You nailed it
on the stained-glass challenge.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.006
{\an1}You nailed it
on the contrast.

28:37.090 --> 28:39.467
{\an1}This border is very clean
and very smooth.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.136
{\an1}The geometric background
is cool as [bleep].

28:41.219 --> 28:43.721
You did a great job.

28:43.805 --> 28:47.308
It's time to debate a win
between Duffy and Katie.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.310
{\an8}It's a really tough call.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.229
{\an8}If you're going
straight contrast,

28:51.312 --> 28:52.856
{\an8}Katie, by far,
takes it down.

28:52.939 --> 28:55.108
{\an9}(Chris)
Although they're both
two great tattoos,

28:55.191 --> 28:56.860
- I got to go with Katie.
- I agree with you guys.

28:56.943 --> 29:00.029
The winner of the head-to-head
challenge is Katie.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.739
{\an3}It's just gonna make me
want to fight her

29:01.823 --> 29:02.449
{\an3}a little harder
next time.

29:02.532 --> 29:05.243
{\an3}I'm taking you down,
Katie.

29:05.326 --> 29:07.120
Erik.

29:07.203 --> 29:09.497
You went head-to-head
with Tyler.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.333
This light background
and the darker foreground

29:12.417 --> 29:13.835
really makes
this image readable.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.962
{\an1}But to make it look more
like a stained-glass pattern,

29:16.045 --> 29:18.673
the big areas of red,
that would normally be

29:18.756 --> 29:21.217
{\an1}multiple pieces of glass
to fill that area.

29:21.301 --> 29:23.052
{\an3}It's just
a very simplistic take

29:23.136 --> 29:26.014
on the stained-glass aspect.

29:26.097 --> 29:28.516
Tyler.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.186
{\an3}I like the drawing
that you did for it.

29:31.269 --> 29:34.022
{\an3}You just have some serious
issues on the line work in here.

29:34.105 --> 29:35.690
The border looks wobbly.

29:35.773 --> 29:36.900
It doesn't look sharp.

29:36.983 --> 29:37.775
{\an1}You drew this.
You designed it.

29:37.859 --> 29:40.528
You gave yourself
this tough battle.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.572
That top line,
when I was outlining it,

29:42.655 --> 29:44.365
I was holding his leg down.

29:44.449 --> 29:47.911
{\an3}Set yourself up for greatness,
not for failure.

29:47.994 --> 29:50.663
Let's debate a win
between Erik and Tyler.

29:50.747 --> 29:53.124
{\an9}If I had Tyler's drawing
with Erik's craftsmanship,

29:53.208 --> 29:55.376
{\an8}you'd have one "knock 'em
out of the park" tattoo,

29:55.460 --> 29:56.419
{\an9}but for legibility
and cleanliness,

29:56.503 --> 29:57.712
{\an8}I would run with Erik.

29:57.795 --> 30:00.757
- Erik.
- Erik, congratulations.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.677
Kito.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.596
You went head-to-head
with Matt.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.640
{\an3}You have issues getting
this color solid.

30:08.723 --> 30:10.600
{\an3}Your gray by the ear
all the way up

30:10.683 --> 30:11.893
to the top of the head,

30:11.976 --> 30:13.019
it's just very sketchy.

30:13.102 --> 30:14.562
But I hit
the contrast mark, right?

30:14.646 --> 30:16.439
{\an1}Just putting blue
next to yellow, yeah.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.233
There is a contrast there,

30:18.316 --> 30:19.526
{\an1}but it's not using contrast
artistically

30:19.609 --> 30:24.489
{\an1}to make this wolf
look dynamic.

30:24.572 --> 30:27.242
Matt.

30:27.325 --> 30:28.618
{\an1}You definitely hit
the contrast.

30:28.701 --> 30:30.703
{\an1}The areas of the muzzle
and the eyes

30:30.787 --> 30:31.829
{\an1}really standing out from
the dark brown in the coat.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.581
{\an3}You made this tattoo
look really tough,

30:33.665 --> 30:35.917
really bold, really strong.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.629
{\an3}It's a sticker.
This is a good job.

30:39.712 --> 30:40.797
{\an8}There's really
no question here.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.925
{\an8}I'm gonna go with Matt
on this, for sure.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.385
- Matt.
- Matt.

30:45.468 --> 30:47.929
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, guys.

30:48.012 --> 30:49.264
Chris.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.516
You went head-to-head
with MV.

30:51.599 --> 30:53.268
I think she's beautiful.

30:53.351 --> 30:54.269
I really love the pose.

30:54.352 --> 30:56.604
{\an1}This is like a nice, bright,
color bomb tattoo

30:56.688 --> 30:58.606
that really shows
a lot of contrast.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.109
{\an1}Just in your depth
of shading,

31:01.192 --> 31:03.444
you did a great job getting
this color in there solid.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.113
Thanks, guys.

31:05.196 --> 31:08.116
MV.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.617
{\an1}The two elements
of this challenge,

31:09.701 --> 31:11.369
the stained glass
and the contrast--

31:11.452 --> 31:12.078
you nailed them both.

31:12.161 --> 31:14.163
The color palette you chose

31:14.247 --> 31:15.790
undeniably shows contrast.

31:15.873 --> 31:17.292
{\an3}The majority of the color
that you put in here

31:17.375 --> 31:19.294
is incredibly solid.

31:19.377 --> 31:20.753
It really looks vibrant.

31:20.837 --> 31:23.089
I feel at least I've "shooken"
off some of the nerves.

31:24.882 --> 31:27.343
{\an7}I feel like they're both
dynamic images,

31:27.427 --> 31:31.014
{\an8}but Chris's color blends and his
color saturation are top-notch.

31:31.097 --> 31:32.432
{\an8}I have to go with Chris.

31:32.515 --> 31:33.308
{\an8}(Dave)
Winner of the head-to-head
challenge is Chris.

31:33.391 --> 31:37.061
Congratulations.

31:37.145 --> 31:37.937
Earl.

31:38.021 --> 31:41.316
You went head-to-head
with Marisa.

31:41.399 --> 31:42.942
{\an1}You nailed contrast
in this frame.

31:43.026 --> 31:45.695
{\an1}This beveled edge,
the shading and the highlights,

31:45.778 --> 31:47.655
{\an1}and the contouring really
creates depth of that window.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.283
{\an1}I think you pulled that off
really nice.

31:51.326 --> 31:55.288
Marisa.

31:55.371 --> 31:58.291
{\an3}Strong one-pass outline.
Definitely an improvement.

31:58.374 --> 32:00.209
I had better skin
this time.

32:00.293 --> 32:01.336
{\an3}Yeah, you look
more comfortable.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.046
{\an3}The design overall,
you took the time

32:03.129 --> 32:06.215
{\an3}to try to understand what it was
that you were drawing.

32:06.299 --> 32:09.177
This is definitely the best
tattoo we've seen from you.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.012
Thank you.

32:11.095 --> 32:14.182
{\an7}Earl's tattoo does show a little
more technical ability today.

32:14.265 --> 32:15.350
I'm going with Earl.

32:15.433 --> 32:16.601
Congratulations, Earl.

32:16.684 --> 32:19.729
You have won
the head-to-head challenge.

32:19.812 --> 32:21.356
Dave.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.232
You went head-to-head
with St. Marq

32:23.316 --> 32:26.361
The contrast in the colors
play nicely to this tattoo.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.988
{\an3}I like the attention to detail
in the finer lines,

32:29.072 --> 32:29.947
{\an3}how you connected
the glass together.

32:30.031 --> 32:34.786
{\an3}Overall, I think
you did a decent job here.

32:34.869 --> 32:36.954
St. Marq.

32:37.038 --> 32:39.540
You took such an attention
to detail

32:39.624 --> 32:42.126
with making these panes
look like glass.

32:42.210 --> 32:44.087
And the little areas
where you're showing

32:44.170 --> 32:46.172
that the lead
is dimensional.

32:46.255 --> 32:48.049
I wanted to stick to
a super-bold lead outline.

32:48.132 --> 32:50.843
{\an1}Put in the waves
and the colors and the glass

32:50.927 --> 32:52.970
really shows a lot
of great contrast

32:53.054 --> 32:54.889
{\an1}just in the dynamic shape
of the birds.

32:54.972 --> 32:58.768
Killer take
on this challenge.

32:58.851 --> 33:01.229
{\an7}Marq really surprised us
with some techniques

33:01.312 --> 33:02.855
{\an7}that we weren't
expecting to see today.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.774
Hands down,
this one goes to St. Marq.

33:04.857 --> 33:06.859
{\an3}I'm definitely
with Marq today.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.403
Winner of the head-to-head
challenge is St. Marq.

33:08.486 --> 33:11.531
Congratulations.

33:11.614 --> 33:12.949
Kruseman.

33:13.032 --> 33:13.991
You went head-to-head
with Miami.

33:14.075 --> 33:17.245
{\an3}Craftsmanship in the tattoo
is really nice.

33:17.328 --> 33:18.663
{\an3}Where I think
you fell short here

33:18.746 --> 33:19.914
is you camouflaged yourself.

33:19.997 --> 33:22.917
{\an1}You got the same colors and the
same tones of the same colors

33:23.000 --> 33:24.419
{\an1}in the foreground
and background,

33:24.502 --> 33:25.920
{\an1}so it's hard to tell
what's going on.

33:26.003 --> 33:28.548
You have a lot of shapes in here
also that don't lend themselves

33:28.631 --> 33:30.007
{\an3}specifically
to stained glass.

33:30.091 --> 33:32.760
{\an3}It doesn't particularly hit
this challenge.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.471
Miami.

33:35.555 --> 33:36.889
{\an1}It just doesn't have
the stained-glass feel.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.975
{\an5}(Miami)
He was one of those clients
that would be on the verge

33:39.058 --> 33:40.184
of walking out.

33:40.268 --> 33:41.060
I did whatever it took
to keep him in that seat.

33:41.144 --> 33:43.062
{\an1}Well, I'll say that it
definitely looks

33:43.146 --> 33:44.272
like a carousel horse.

33:44.355 --> 33:45.606
{\an1}One of my problems
with this tattoo

33:45.690 --> 33:47.817
{\an1}is in judging contrast,
it's a little murky.

33:47.900 --> 33:50.903
{\an1}I think that you blew your wad
doing that frame around it.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.572
It could have helped
you out in contrast

33:52.655 --> 33:54.615
{\an1}if those dark areas of black
were really solid

33:54.699 --> 33:56.617
and the gold frame
was really vibrant.

33:56.701 --> 33:57.785
{\an1}But it looks like it
was too much

33:57.869 --> 33:59.287
{\an1}for you to handle
in the amount of time.

33:59.370 --> 34:00.663
{\an1}If you can't meet
the challenge,

34:00.747 --> 34:01.456
{\an1}you could be the best tattooer
in the world,

34:01.539 --> 34:04.834
but you're going home.

34:04.917 --> 34:07.295
{\an7}This is a tough
head-to-head too,

34:07.378 --> 34:09.130
{\an7}'cause both
didn't hit every mark.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.882
{\an8}(Dave)
I think that Kruseman
at least attempted

34:10.965 --> 34:13.760
{\an8}a stained-glass approach
more than Miami.

34:13.842 --> 34:14.802
I'm going with Kruseman.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.387
I give it
to Kruseman as well.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.306
{\an1}Kruseman.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.391
Kruseman, congratulations.

34:23.561 --> 34:26.147
The human-canvas jury
is deliberating right now.

34:26.230 --> 34:29.108
Their vote will put one artist
up for elimination,

34:29.192 --> 34:31.152
and the canvas will be here
to tell us why.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.654
Head back to the loft,
and we'll call you back

34:33.737 --> 34:35.489
when we have a decision.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.411
I busted my ass
on that tattoo.

34:40.495 --> 34:41.661
{\an1}Do you think you put more
of your heart into it?

34:41.746 --> 34:43.831
[bleep], yeah,
I put my [bleep] heart into it,

34:43.915 --> 34:45.666
because I'm down to the last
three [bleep] minutes.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.001
I'm here
for a [bleep] reason.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.128
Hell, Craig, I mean,
you know what I've been through.

34:49.212 --> 34:50.420
We've been through
a lot of [bleep].

34:50.505 --> 34:53.841
If I leave here, I'm going home
to maybe no house.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.092
I've lost a lot.

34:55.176 --> 34:57.261
You know, I've come here
to [bleep] prove a point.

34:57.345 --> 34:58.179
And I ain't proved [bleep],
you know what I'm saying?

34:58.262 --> 35:00.640
It's like
I didn't prove that point yet.

35:00.723 --> 35:03.476
{\an1}If I were you, I'd be prepared
to fight for that.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.777
All right,
today we're testing contrast

35:12.860 --> 35:14.070
with stained-glass-tattoo
designs.

35:14.153 --> 35:17.365
In the bottom right now,
I'm seeing Big Ceeze.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.534
{\an4}(Oliver)
It is more than just
a little bit crooked.

35:19.617 --> 35:21.619
{\an3}Look at the left side
of the outline going down.

35:21.702 --> 35:23.496
It literally bends
and bends back in.

35:23.579 --> 35:26.749
Ceeze is the master
in this scenario too.

35:26.833 --> 35:29.669
Kito hit the challenge
better than Big Ceeze.

35:29.752 --> 35:31.420
{\an3}Just for the sake
that he used color, sure.

35:31.504 --> 35:32.964
{\an3}But, I mean, look,
anywhere that's dark,

35:33.047 --> 35:34.257
you'll find a light spot.

35:34.340 --> 35:36.384
{\an3}Anywhere that's light,
you'll find a dark spot.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.261
- It looks...
- Scratchy.

35:38.344 --> 35:39.720
{\an7}It's interesting
that we're bringing a master

35:39.804 --> 35:41.180
{\an8}and his apprentice out here.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.640
{\an8}That shows the experience level

35:42.723 --> 35:43.975
{\an7}that was or was not taught
to that apprentice,

35:44.058 --> 35:46.602
{\an8}and they're both
in the same boat.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.062
We also have yet
to talk about Miami.

35:48.145 --> 35:51.858
This at least shows
some kind of contrast

35:51.941 --> 35:53.276
We're not only
checking to see

35:53.359 --> 35:57.488
{\an1}if they can put white next
to red and yellow next to blue.

35:57.572 --> 35:58.698
We're checking to see

35:58.781 --> 36:00.700
{\an1}if they can put the ink
in the skin

36:00.783 --> 36:01.868
{\an1}so the contrast
is actually well done.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.912
That Miami tattoo is beat.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.582
Well, human-canvas jury's
gonna vote for their pick.

36:07.665 --> 36:08.833
I'm curious to hear
how they went.

36:08.916 --> 36:10.334
{\an3}Always.

36:10.418 --> 36:14.046
{\an8}We're here to decide who had
the worst tattoo of the day.

36:14.130 --> 36:17.300
{\an1}This is my tattoo,
and my artist was Kito.

36:17.383 --> 36:18.759
{\an6}(man)
That border
is just terrible, man.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.511
{\an3}I know you're trying
to go for a broken-glass effect,

36:20.595 --> 36:22.263
{\an3}but that doesn't look
like broken glass.

36:22.346 --> 36:23.472
It just looks like it's got

36:23.556 --> 36:24.640
{\an3}a whole paint-by-numbers
feel to it.

36:24.724 --> 36:28.019
Definitely do not think it's
the worst tattoo of the day.

36:28.102 --> 36:29.437
This is my tattoo.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.147
My artist was Big Ceeze.

36:31.230 --> 36:31.772
{\an5}(woman)
If I didn't already know
that it was stained glass,

36:31.856 --> 36:33.983
I would have no idea.

36:34.066 --> 36:35.776
{\an1}Does anybody else notice
how off to the right it is?

36:35.860 --> 36:36.819
- Yes.
- Yes.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.362
- It's a little crooked.
- That's a huge piece

36:38.446 --> 36:40.489
on your back--
that's got to be centered.

36:40.573 --> 36:42.742
{\an5}(woman)
If that was on me,
I'd be pissed.

36:44.911 --> 36:46.287
That's my tattoo,
and my artist was Miami.

36:46.370 --> 36:49.332
{\an3}That just looks like a horse
in a mirror frame.

36:49.415 --> 36:51.000
The challenge
is stained glass.

36:51.083 --> 36:53.336
- At least I have color.
[laughter]

37:03.888 --> 37:07.975
All right,
the judges want to see...

37:08.059 --> 37:09.602
Big Ceeze...

37:09.685 --> 37:12.772
Kito...

37:12.855 --> 37:13.814
and Miami.

37:13.898 --> 37:17.109
See y'all downstairs.

37:19.904 --> 37:21.155
{\an1}Anything could happen
down there.

37:21.239 --> 37:24.992
It's gonna be nerve-racking
waiting to see who comes up.

37:30.331 --> 37:33.834
Today you were being tested
on contrast.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.836
It's time to see
who the human-canvas jury

37:35.920 --> 37:38.547
determined had the worst tattoo
of the day.

37:44.595 --> 37:47.473
Big Ceeze, you're here
because the human-canvas jury

37:47.556 --> 37:51.644
determined that you had
the worst tattoo of the day.

37:51.727 --> 37:53.062
I like it, personally.

37:53.145 --> 37:56.107
Chris, why did the jury vote
Big Ceeze as worst tattoo?

37:56.190 --> 37:58.693
{\an3}Because it's supposed
to be colored.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.861
{\an3}And also, you can see
that it's not as symmetrical

38:00.945 --> 38:03.030
as it's supposed to be.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.116
{\an3}At the time,
it looked perfectly straight.

38:05.199 --> 38:07.618
{\an3}I apologize for that, you know.
That's not what I wanted.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.996
{\an6}I wanted you to be happy
with what you were getting.

38:10.079 --> 38:11.580
The tattoo was off.

38:11.664 --> 38:14.166
{\an1}Just make sure
that you line stuff up more.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.459
- Chris, thank you, buddy.
- Thank you.

38:18.879 --> 38:20.172
{\an1}The bad placement,
that's a big knockdown.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.216
The placement was wrong,
but, you know,

38:22.299 --> 38:24.885
the tattoo itself
was done good.

38:24.969 --> 38:25.886
It's noticeably crooked.

38:25.970 --> 38:29.056
{\an1}There's a good chance
you're going home over it.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.641
Kito.

38:30.725 --> 38:33.728
{\an3}You had a lot of application
problems on this thing.

38:33.811 --> 38:36.105
This whole tattoo echoes
that you have a hard time

38:36.188 --> 38:38.274
{\an3}putting in really deep,
bold, solid colors.

38:38.357 --> 38:39.775
I'm mainly
a black-and-gray artist,

38:39.859 --> 38:40.609
so I had to dig deep.

38:40.693 --> 38:43.654
{\an3}In this competition,
50% of the time,

38:43.738 --> 38:45.156
you are gonna be doing color.

38:45.239 --> 38:47.950
So that doesn't give me a good
look into the future for you.

38:48.034 --> 38:49.118
{\an1}When you think
about it too, man,

38:49.201 --> 38:51.746
{\an1}Kito did a good job with
trying to do the stained glass,

38:51.829 --> 38:53.539
{\an4}Miami didn't do
any stained glass.

38:53.622 --> 38:54.790
{\an3}I did what my client
wanted me to do.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.417
{\an1}You're not
the only one, though, man.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.918
{\an3}But I'm talking,
so, please.

38:58.002 --> 38:58.878
I was dealt chicken [bleep].

38:58.961 --> 39:00.463
I made it chicken salad.

39:00.546 --> 39:03.174
{\an1}You're down here
for a multitude of reasons, man.

39:03.257 --> 39:04.842
{\an1}We see line mistakes
in here.

39:04.925 --> 39:06.135
{\an1}We see saturation issues
with color.

39:06.218 --> 39:09.180
I busted my ass
on that tattoo.

39:09.263 --> 39:11.223
{\an3}I didn't take
the easy way out.

39:11.307 --> 39:12.641
{\an3}I mean, doing a cross
is two arrows

39:12.725 --> 39:13.934
stacked on top
of each other.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.062
You look at my tattoo,
it's a smooth tattoo.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.563
- What I'm saying is that--
- If you can't line up a cross

39:17.646 --> 39:20.024
on someone's back, you don't
need to be tattooing, Jack.

39:20.107 --> 39:23.152
We got to debate
who's going home.

39:23.235 --> 39:24.945
{\an3}(Chris)
Kito tried to do stained glass.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.572
{\an3}He didn't knock it
out of the park, but he did it.

39:26.655 --> 39:28.949
{\an3}My thing right now
is with Ceeze and with Miami.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.786
{\an7}When people miss
the challenge,

39:31.869 --> 39:34.955
{\an7}then we have to fall back
to the fundamentals.

39:35.039 --> 39:38.375
{\an1}The one has the most problems
is Miami's.

39:38.459 --> 39:41.754
Which way
are you leaning, Chris?

39:41.837 --> 39:43.798
{\an3}Miami.

39:43.881 --> 39:45.007
The judges have decided.

39:45.091 --> 39:49.970
Miami, you do not have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.639
{\an3}Any given punch in the fight
could be the one

39:51.722 --> 39:54.892
{\an3}that knocks you out,
and this is just that.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.272
I'm [bleep] shocked.

40:00.356 --> 40:02.399
A lot of these cats that are
still standing up there--

40:02.483 --> 40:03.734
they played this game safe.

40:03.818 --> 40:04.443
That's not me.

40:04.527 --> 40:06.779
I put my balls on the line.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.114
And that's what got me
sent home.

40:08.197 --> 40:08.489
I'm [bleep] pissed.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.788
{\an5}(announcer)
On the next episode
of <i> Ink Master...</i>

40:15.871 --> 40:16.872
I am St. [bleep] Marq.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.415
I am a tattoo god.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.835
You would like to go
head-to-head with me?

40:20.918 --> 40:22.545
- Any day.
- That would be a mistake.

40:22.628 --> 40:23.546
I hate that Miami went home.

40:23.629 --> 40:27.174
Now it's just all about
taking people out.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.759
{\an1}You're in the shark tank
right now.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.928
{\an1}You got to drop your nuts,
man, and just [bleep] everybody.

40:31.011 --> 40:32.888
You're being a dick.

40:32.972 --> 40:34.223
{\an3}Don't [bleep] bring this
out of me.

40:34.306 --> 40:35.516
There's no crying
in tattooing.

40:35.599 --> 40:36.308
{\an1}I hate not having
enough time.

40:36.392 --> 40:38.519
{\an1}It's something drawn
that I like.

40:38.602 --> 40:40.479
{\an4}(Oliver)
That body looks
more like a seal.

40:40.563 --> 40:43.482
{\an3}You put yourself
in a situation that's tough.

40:43.566 --> 40:45.359
{\an1}You lost it
in the face, man.

40:45.442 --> 40:47.528
{\an3}If you get rattled, man, you
got to get back on your horse.

40:47.611 --> 40:49.071
This tattoo's pretty messy.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.447
I fought to get that much
into it.

40:50.531 --> 40:51.031
I'm gonna say
that's bull[bleep].

40:51.115 --> 40:53.284
It does not look good.
