E. R.

00:06.139 --> 00:07.283
Previously on E. R.

00:07.284 --> 00:09.612
I haven't had a contraction in two weeks,
you know?

00:09.613 --> 00:11.304
You still need to take it easy.

00:11.305 --> 00:14.472
You seem to have taken on several
additional responsibilities in my absence.

00:14.473 --> 00:15.636
Romano told me
to keep this place running.

00:15.637 --> 00:16.837
I don't usually do this.

00:17.038 --> 00:19.333
- Bring somebody home.
- Trust me. I don't either.

00:19.334 --> 00:20.663
Lool, I appointed you Associate Chief...

00:20.664 --> 00:23.614
...so that I have a lieutenant
on the front lines that I could count on.

00:23.615 --> 00:25.662
Now, you want to be barefoot
and pregnant in the kitchen,

00:25.766 --> 00:27.862
you have my blessing, go forth and multiply.

00:27.863 --> 00:29.488
- How old are you?
- Twenty.

00:29.489 --> 00:31.752
- In September.
- She's a teenager.

00:31.787 --> 00:32.792
- Carter.
- I didn't know.

00:32.793 --> 00:35.962
- I like you a lot, Rena.
- You wish I was older.

00:35.997 --> 00:37.622
E. R. 7x17 "SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST"

00:37.695 --> 00:41.674
Can't keep me here. I need to go!

00:41.943 --> 00:46.023
You've got to let me go.
My kids are coming home from school.

00:46.197 --> 00:49.862
I meet them at the bus stop
at 3:30 every day.

00:50.035 --> 00:51.945
Relax. It's only 10 in the morning.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.822
My icebox is empty.
I've got nothing to cook for dinner.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
You're in the hospital, ma'am.
We're going to take care of you.

00:59.169 --> 01:02.539
I could get some ground chuck.
But they want 69 cents a pound.

01:02.715 --> 01:05.254
- Peter!
- Have you heard of such a thing?

01:05.468 --> 01:08.137
I remember paying 29 cents a pound.

01:08.304 --> 01:10.795
- Where have you been?
- Don't even think about T-bone.

01:10.974 --> 01:13.465
I had to put a Swan in upstairs.
This the consult?

01:13.644 --> 01:16.313
- Mrs. Howard.
- So, what's the problem?

01:16.480 --> 01:19.149
Nursing home sent her in
because she's not eating.

01:19.316 --> 01:20.431
Doesn't sound surgical.

01:20.609 --> 01:22.982
Could be. You took out
her gallbladder last month.

01:23.154 --> 01:26.154
- But there's macaroni and cheese.
- Hello, Mrs. Howard.

01:27.408 --> 01:30.694
- So nice to see you.
- I'm Dr. Benton.

01:30.870 --> 01:35.663
I know. I never forget
a handsome face.

01:36.084 --> 01:37.282
- Simon?
- She's afebrile.

01:37.460 --> 01:39.749
I've ordered a hemogram...

01:40.422 --> 01:42.331
Simon! Simon!

01:46.678 --> 01:48.220
Simon!

01:52.185 --> 01:54.012
- Who are you?
- Simon!

01:54.187 --> 01:56.809
Are you Simon? No?

01:57.023 --> 01:59.395
Yosh, you seen a little guy
running through here?

01:59.567 --> 02:02.105
- Sorry.
- Hey, Carter.

02:02.278 --> 02:03.394
- Lose something?
- Simon.

02:03.572 --> 02:05.861
- Where's his mom?
- Mom went to the cafeteria...

02:06.033 --> 02:08.783
...to get some chocolate milk.
But Simon's not getting any treats...

02:08.952 --> 02:12.536
- ... until he lets me draw his blood.
- I don't want you to take my blood.

02:12.707 --> 02:14.534
We're only gonna take
about this much.

02:15.209 --> 02:19.373
- If you sit still, this won't hurt.
- I don't want a needle.

02:19.547 --> 02:21.587
- How about a papoose?
- I think we're okay.

02:21.758 --> 02:23.667
You sure?
Hate for you to lose him again.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.169
- Will you just hold his arm still?
- Okay.

02:26.345 --> 02:29.216
Be brave and do not move.

02:30.309 --> 02:32.515
- Good one at the wrist.
- Antecube looks better.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.556
No!

02:35.731 --> 02:38.222
- Want to try an arm board?
- No. Let's take a break.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.060
Abby, I need another nurse.

02:40.235 --> 02:42.774
- You okay here?
- Go.

02:43.072 --> 02:45.860
- He kicked me in the face.
- We need some Haldol.

02:46.034 --> 02:48.073
Careful. He bit
a nurse's finger in Psych.

02:48.244 --> 02:50.866
- What's he doing down here?
- He cut up his face.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.322
- You want some help?
- Yeah.

02:55.877 --> 02:57.786
Hey! Man, what'd you do that for?

02:59.047 --> 03:01.717
- It was an April Fools' joke.
- April Fools'?

03:01.926 --> 03:03.170
Was that Haldol?

03:54.273 --> 03:58.436
The board is full, gurneys are lining the
halls, we got another 30 in the rack.

03:58.610 --> 04:02.230
We desperately need to clear out the
rooms, and you're wasting your time...

04:02.407 --> 04:05.776
...on April Fools' pranks. No more
shenanigans for the rest of the day.

04:05.952 --> 04:08.443
- Have I made myself clear?
- Yes, ma'am.

04:09.498 --> 04:12.582
- Dave!
- Yeah.

04:13.794 --> 04:15.870
- How much did you give him?
- Ten milligrams.

04:16.046 --> 04:19.047
- Okay. I want you to take a nap.
- I'm fine.

04:19.216 --> 04:21.209
- What did I just say?
- Go take a nap.

04:21.385 --> 04:23.841
- Before that?
- No more fooling around.

04:24.013 --> 04:26.504
That's right. Now, get back to work.

04:28.267 --> 04:31.518
- Malucci!
- It wasn't me, I swear.

04:36.151 --> 04:39.650
- What?
- Nothing.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.147
- What's the matter with him?
- Ten of Haldol.

04:42.324 --> 04:44.364
Oh, yeah?

04:56.839 --> 04:59.247
- Hey.
- Dr. Carter.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.841
You were supposed to get this
after we took blood.

05:04.014 --> 05:06.719
- I'm sorry. I can get another one.
- No. That's okay.

05:06.892 --> 05:09.098
- You want another chocolate milk?
- No, really-

05:09.270 --> 05:11.939
I don't mind. Be a good boy, Simon.
I'll be right back.

05:14.275 --> 05:16.482
- I didn't call you down here.
- The nurses did.

05:16.653 --> 05:19.819
- They said you were having some trouble.
- Not me.

05:20.490 --> 05:21.948
Well, he's ready now.

05:22.116 --> 05:24.275
- Malik, can you give me a hand?
- Yeah, sure.

05:24.995 --> 05:28.363
- It's better if you don't hold onto him.
- Yeah. We tried that once.

05:28.540 --> 05:30.449
- Ended up in the closet.
- Trust me.

05:32.878 --> 05:34.207
Purple and a red top.

05:34.380 --> 05:37.499
Okay, Simon. Are you ready?

05:37.716 --> 05:40.468
You might want to give
Simon here a friendly hug.

05:41.429 --> 05:44.964
Keep blowing bubbles, Simon.
Blow right through the pain, okay?

05:47.560 --> 05:48.723
Fine.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.604
Good. That's it.

05:54.610 --> 05:56.602
- Good boy.
- What do you want for the labs?

05:56.820 --> 06:01.483
A CBC, lytes, BUN,
creatinine and glucose.

06:02.409 --> 06:05.826
Okay. We are done.

06:06.039 --> 06:07.533
You were very brave.

06:07.749 --> 06:11.200
Let me hook you up with a
Band-Aid, and you are good to go.

06:12.796 --> 06:14.290
- Thank you.
- No problem.

06:14.464 --> 06:16.540
- So how's your internship going?
- It's good.

06:16.716 --> 06:19.919
Yeah? I haven't seen you
around lately. You been busy?

06:20.095 --> 06:21.839
Yeah.

06:22.931 --> 06:25.423
- I should probably get back.
- Nice to see you again.

06:25.893 --> 06:27.268
You too.

06:28.854 --> 06:29.886
Is this the trauma?

06:30.064 --> 06:32.982
Yeah. Eddie Palcynski, 32,
single gunshot wound to the belly.

06:33.151 --> 06:36.151
- Hypotensive initially.
- I take it he's not an innocent victim.

06:36.320 --> 06:40.152
- Tried to hold up a liquor store.
- Wasn't me. That other dude had a knife.

06:40.366 --> 06:42.406
- Any pain in the chest?
- Just my stomach.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.611
- What happened to you?
- Chased his partner.

06:44.788 --> 06:46.069
- You get him?
- Not exactly.

06:46.290 --> 06:48.117
No, you actually
would have had to run.

06:48.959 --> 06:51.036
- Heard you had a GSW.
- Right upper quadrant.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.754
- Can you get this?
- No problem.

06:52.922 --> 06:55.080
- Need a hand?
- Take a look at that arm injury.

06:55.258 --> 06:57.962
- You just need a Band-Aid.
- Yeah, over your mouth.

06:58.135 --> 07:00.805
- Officer?
- Be good, they'll give you a lollipop.

07:00.972 --> 07:03.380
On my count. One, two, three...

07:03.558 --> 07:07.603
- Where is my purse? I've lost my purse!
- Hey, who's got the screamer?

07:07.771 --> 07:10.808
- Dr. Finch. Benton cleared her belly.
- Can we put her in a room?

07:10.983 --> 07:13.734
- If we had one.
- Nurse, I need my wallet and car keys.

07:13.902 --> 07:16.524
- Nice outfit you got there, Randi.
- Thanks, Dr. Carter.

07:16.697 --> 07:20.113
- I can't go anywhere without my keys!
- You look nice too.

07:20.285 --> 07:23.071
So are you Dr. Carter
now or Mr. Hyde?

07:23.245 --> 07:26.532
I'm sorry about that. I guess
I just needed a cup of coffee.

07:26.708 --> 07:29.494
And I suppose seeing Miss Bubbles
had nothing to do...

07:29.669 --> 07:31.461
- ... with your sudden mood change?
- No.

07:31.629 --> 07:34.299
No? Come on. You've been
moping around here for days.

07:34.466 --> 07:37.586
And then the minute she shows up,
you turn into Mr. Congeniality?

07:37.761 --> 07:40.134
I was just being friendly.
I was!

07:40.847 --> 07:42.887
Did somebody order a school bus?

07:51.735 --> 07:53.941
Grace Linden.
Stuart's having an asthma attack.

07:54.111 --> 07:56.603
Get a gurney and a hand-held neb.
You use an inhaler?

07:57.365 --> 07:59.025
- Empty.
- How long's he been bad?

07:59.200 --> 08:01.407
About 10 minutes.
There are fumes on the bus.

08:01.578 --> 08:03.238
- Exhaust fumes?
- No, something else.

08:03.413 --> 08:06.249
- Some of the kids are throwing up.
- We can't bring them in.

08:06.458 --> 08:09.626
It's a HAZMAT situation. Until
we know there's no contamination...

08:09.795 --> 08:11.503
- ... you have to wait outside.
- In the cold?

08:12.089 --> 08:14.545
A gram of cefotetan and
repeat the CBC in pre-op.

08:14.717 --> 08:17.635
- What's this?
- Small-caliber gunshot to the liver.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.171
I want four units
of type-specific in the O.R.

08:20.348 --> 08:24.049
- Thought Benton was on.
- Yeah. You need something?

08:24.227 --> 08:25.507
How long's the case?

08:25.687 --> 08:28.688
Couple of hepatic drains,
couple of sutures and we'll be done.

08:28.857 --> 08:30.399
- Sounds quick.
- Should be.

08:30.567 --> 08:32.524
Hope so.

08:33.904 --> 08:39.859
- He needs 125 of Solu-Medrol...
- We are walking. We are not talking.

08:40.035 --> 08:42.241
Let's get him into a gown
and bag his clothes.

08:42.413 --> 08:44.739
Okay. Can you hop up here?

08:46.709 --> 08:49.664
Stu, Stu, stupid!

08:49.880 --> 08:52.169
I think you broke your ass.
I can see the crack.

08:52.340 --> 08:54.381
When the hand goes up,
the mouth goes shut.

08:54.552 --> 08:58.086
- Arms up.
- You guys on a field trip?

08:58.264 --> 09:01.218
- Art Institute.
- Oh, yeah? The Gauguin exhibit?

09:01.391 --> 09:03.717
- We never made it.
- Hey, nice rack, Stu.

09:03.936 --> 09:05.845
- Make them bounce.
- Okay, that's enough!

09:06.063 --> 09:07.475
Hey, doc, you do liposuction?

09:07.649 --> 09:11.397
Toby, next time it is you,
me and the principal.

09:11.569 --> 09:14.773
- Keep moving. We are walking...
- Don't even listen to them.

09:16.450 --> 09:18.110
Anything else?

09:18.285 --> 09:20.443
Some number-one chromic
on a liver needle.

09:20.621 --> 09:23.326
Lizzie, I heard you're doing
an ex-lap on a GSW?

09:23.499 --> 09:27.449
- You heard correctly.
- Sure you can still reach the table?

09:27.628 --> 09:29.954
Least I can see the table.

09:30.298 --> 09:33.667
Well, I was gonna offer
to assist after my AV shunt...

09:33.843 --> 09:36.132
...but not if you' re gonna go
prenatal on me.

09:36.304 --> 09:40.468
Actually, if you really want to help, you
can order me some pizza and ice cream.

09:41.059 --> 09:43.135
Think you need it?

09:48.317 --> 09:50.559
- Razor wire.
- More like a cyclone fence.

09:50.736 --> 09:52.444
- It's pretty deep.
- We can help you.

09:52.613 --> 09:56.528
- I need to use the toilet.
- We're gonna move you to a quiet room.

09:56.701 --> 09:59.239
I need you to
spread your fingers like this.

09:59.663 --> 10:02.663
Dr. Weaver, we got
a status asthmaticus.

10:02.832 --> 10:05.158
Chuny, can you help her
with the bedpan, please?

10:05.335 --> 10:07.957
He needs continuous nebs.
Where do you want to put him?

10:08.130 --> 10:10.586
- One second.
- Sit up for me, Stuart.

10:11.007 --> 10:14.341
- Hey, your guy is seizing in 2.
- Okay.

10:14.511 --> 10:17.678
- Cock your wrist back like this:
- I'll go by myself.

10:17.848 --> 10:20.719
- Can't keep me here or where to go.
- Stand up.

10:20.935 --> 10:24.102
- You can let me go if I want to go.
- Hold your hands like this:

10:24.314 --> 10:26.472
- A prisoner I'm not.
- I'm gonna press down.

10:26.691 --> 10:30.191
- Just keep them up, all right?
- Let me go. I don't need to be here.

10:31.029 --> 10:33.436
- Hey!
- This is not right.

10:33.907 --> 10:36.196
- Drop the gun, ma'am.
- Can't do this to me.

10:36.368 --> 10:40.366
- Drop the gun, ma'am. Drop it now.
- Just leave me alone!

10:40.580 --> 10:41.660
Everybody calm down.

10:41.874 --> 10:43.783
Put it down now
and no one will get hurt.

10:44.001 --> 10:49.244
- Leave me alone! Just leave me alone!
- Drop the gun.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.764
Leave me-

11:11.281 --> 11:13.771
10 blade. Set up a cell saver
and try for a pulse ox.

11:13.949 --> 11:14.981
Central line is in.

11:15.159 --> 11:17.069
- Two units on the infuser.
- Rib spreader.

11:17.245 --> 11:19.238
- We asked three times.
- She didn't respond.

11:19.414 --> 11:21.288
- Asystole.
- Start internal compressions.

11:21.458 --> 11:22.738
How'd she get your gun?

11:22.959 --> 11:25.331
- What are you gonna say?
- Put the suction on high.

11:25.503 --> 11:28.125
- We'll talk about it.
- Right atrium is shredded.

11:28.298 --> 11:30.790
- We should figure it out.
- Aortic root is blown away.

11:30.968 --> 11:33.638
- Guess one shot wasn't enough.
- Come here.

11:33.805 --> 11:35.215
Another amp of epi.

11:35.389 --> 11:38.924
Side-biting clamp and pick-ups.
I need a cordis introducer for the atrium.

11:39.101 --> 11:42.352
- I need a lap pad. Let's go!
- Hope they get their story straight.

11:47.402 --> 11:48.731
It's okay.

11:48.904 --> 11:51.062
All clear. No carbon monoxide,
no flammables.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.520
The kids smelled something?

11:52.699 --> 11:55.451
Maybe, but it's gone now.
Probably just mass hysteria.

11:55.619 --> 11:56.650
That's it?

11:56.828 --> 12:00.364
Kids smell nail-polish remover, pretty
soon everybody thinks they're sick.

12:00.541 --> 12:03.292
- Do we need to scrub them down?
- No one's contaminated.

12:03.460 --> 12:05.952
All right. Let's split them up.

12:06.339 --> 12:07.619
Who had vomiting?

12:07.798 --> 12:08.830
- Me.
- So did I.

12:09.008 --> 12:12.045
Luka, postural vitals and a pulse ox.

12:12.220 --> 12:13.928
Okay. Come with me.
What's your name?

12:14.097 --> 12:15.841
- Emily.
- Are you still nauseated?

12:16.016 --> 12:17.890
- Yeah.
- Any stiff neck or double vision?

12:18.060 --> 12:20.099
- No.
- Are you really a doctor?

12:20.270 --> 12:22.263
When I'm not out fighting crime.
This way.

12:22.439 --> 12:24.397
All right, guys. Let's go.

12:24.567 --> 12:27.272
- We like it out here.
- They say fresh air's good for you.

12:27.445 --> 12:30.280
- Put out your cigarette.
- You got a spare ashtray?

12:30.447 --> 12:31.942
Come on.

12:32.117 --> 12:34.654
- Beck's suture.
- Fifth and sixth units are in.

12:34.827 --> 12:35.942
How's she doing?

12:36.121 --> 12:38.493
Heart's empty. Not so good.

12:38.665 --> 12:40.325
Looks like hamburger in here.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.336
Officer Kimball,
did you discharge your weapon?

12:43.504 --> 12:46.208
- Go with Detective Westland.
- Satinsky.

12:46.381 --> 12:49.336
- Officer Grant, you're with me.
- Push another atropine.

12:49.510 --> 12:51.633
I need the names of the
treating physicians.

12:51.804 --> 12:54.176
- Dr. Weaver.
-12 French Foley. Let's move, people.

12:54.349 --> 12:57.598
- And Dr. Benton.
- Okay. Inflate balloon.

12:57.768 --> 12:59.845
- Did you witness the shooting?
- We both did.

13:00.063 --> 13:01.261
B- E-N-T-E-N?

13:01.440 --> 13:03.811
- O-N.
- Okay. Hold compressions.

13:05.402 --> 13:07.560
- Still asystole.
- Is she gonna make it?

13:07.738 --> 13:11.949
- Not if you don't let us do our job.
- Let me know if she expires.

13:12.117 --> 13:15.201
- Resume compressions.
- You want some more blood?

13:15.370 --> 13:18.455
- How long has she been down?
- Half an hour.

13:18.833 --> 13:22.961
All right, let's get two more units, and
I need some more 0 silk. Come on.

13:24.922 --> 13:26.038
Deep breath.

13:26.215 --> 13:27.840
Excuse me.

13:28.009 --> 13:31.378
- Once again.
- Is that stuff still in my lungs?

13:31.554 --> 13:33.713
I don't think so.
Everything sounds good.

13:33.890 --> 13:37.058
- What kind of chemical was it?
- We don't know.

13:37.228 --> 13:39.386
Well, then how do you know it's safe?

13:39.564 --> 13:42.979
Because your oxygen level is normal
and your lungs are clear.

13:43.150 --> 13:46.068
Do you think it could hurt my baby?

13:47.238 --> 13:49.065
You're pregnant?

13:49.240 --> 13:50.983
I think so.

13:51.158 --> 13:55.074
Laura Beckton, 23. Put her car
into a fire hydrant. She's altered.

13:55.289 --> 13:57.447
- This is a crime scene.
- We have a critical-

13:57.624 --> 13:58.905
- Go around.
- Let us through!

13:59.126 --> 14:00.917
I can't.

14:01.086 --> 14:05.131
- BP, 120/85. Pulse, 90.
- What's with all the cops?

14:05.299 --> 14:08.881
We had a shooting. Let's get X-ray
down here. Laura, open your eyes.

14:09.261 --> 14:13.674
Pupils are equal and reactive. Let's get
a portable C-spine, chest and pelvis.

14:13.849 --> 14:17.551
Head CT to follow. Looks like
Peter's patient didn't make it.

14:17.729 --> 14:20.730
- What patient?
- Little old lady from the hall.

14:21.107 --> 14:23.100
- That's my patient.
- Cop shot her.

14:23.276 --> 14:24.735
What?

14:30.034 --> 14:31.444
Feeling better?

14:31.618 --> 14:35.617
Starting to. Did that lady die?

14:36.290 --> 14:40.454
- Think it'll be on the news?
- Yeah.

14:41.003 --> 14:45.464
She could have blown my head off.
Weren't you scared?

14:45.633 --> 14:49.678
- A little.
- Then why'd you get in front of me?

14:49.971 --> 14:54.100
Guess I wasn't thinking.
I was really scared.

14:54.267 --> 14:56.177
Me too.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.858
You're still wheezing.

15:04.028 --> 15:07.397
- Have you had a cold?
- No.

15:08.533 --> 15:12.483
Well, something triggered your asthma.
Think it was the fumes?

15:12.662 --> 15:16.245
- Maybe. I don't know.
- You're not sure?

15:19.795 --> 15:21.455
I'm just trying to help.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.587
It was the fumes.

15:24.425 --> 15:26.584
Where'd they come from?

15:29.638 --> 15:33.090
You know that anything that
you tell me, it's a secret.

15:37.856 --> 15:40.561
Another 4.0 proline.

15:40.734 --> 15:44.863
- Shirley, can you rub my back for me?
- Excuse me?

15:45.030 --> 15:47.070
Yeah, just above the waist
on the right.

15:47.241 --> 15:49.234
Oh, yes. Yeah, that's it.

15:50.411 --> 15:55.073
Okay. Release the vessel loop.
Oh, yeah. That's it.

15:55.708 --> 15:58.745
I'm sorry. This must be the day spa.
I was looking for the O.R.

15:59.420 --> 16:00.832
Everything's under control.

16:01.006 --> 16:03.046
I hope so.
You've been in here long enough.

16:03.466 --> 16:06.384
I've repaired the liver, the diaphragm
and now the IVC.

16:07.054 --> 16:09.675
What about the defect
to the ascending colon?

16:10.974 --> 16:12.766
Where?

16:15.271 --> 16:19.399
Little lower.
Yeah, right there.

16:21.777 --> 16:23.569
I hadn't fully run the bowel yet.

16:23.738 --> 16:27.107
Or maybe this is too big a case,
given your delicate condition?

16:27.284 --> 16:31.032
We were doing perfectly well
until you came in, thank you.

16:32.373 --> 16:34.496
- Are you crying?
- No.

16:34.667 --> 16:37.620
We don't cry in the O.R.,
that's what the ladies' room is for.

16:37.795 --> 16:39.538
I'm not crying!

16:39.713 --> 16:43.047
Good. Then you
won't mind if I scrub in.

16:48.098 --> 16:50.802
- Where's Malucci?
- He's with his new fan club.

16:50.975 --> 16:52.090
- As if.
- Find him.

16:52.269 --> 16:54.558
- Right now?
- No, sometime in the next two weeks.

16:54.730 --> 16:56.853
- Don't be so snippy.
- Some kids on the bus...

16:57.024 --> 16:58.684
- ... had a can of solvent.
- Huffing?

16:58.859 --> 17:01.066
- Trying to get high.
- I've got a pregnant girl.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.944
- What were they using?
- I don't know.

17:03.113 --> 17:06.363
They held a rag over my patient's
face and forced him to take a hit.

17:06.532 --> 17:08.941
- Tox screens are negative.
- Solvents don't show up.

17:09.119 --> 17:11.242
- We need to find out.
- I know where to start.

17:11.414 --> 17:13.619
Don't implicate Stuart.
He's afraid of payback.

17:13.790 --> 17:16.164
- Tell him.
- Dr. Dave was talking to me...

17:16.336 --> 17:19.669
- ... and he fell asleep in the chair.
- Now he's drooling.

17:21.633 --> 17:24.124
Okay, Mr. Gunderson, you need
to change into a gown.

17:24.301 --> 17:27.801
The doctor will be in to examine you.
Just have a seat on the... bed.

17:27.973 --> 17:29.253
Dave.

17:29.433 --> 17:31.758
Dave. Dave!

17:31.936 --> 17:33.679
I'm good.

17:34.897 --> 17:36.724
I'm good.

17:37.858 --> 17:39.851
No, man. You gotta
stick it up his butt.

17:40.027 --> 17:42.565
- Okay, guys. What were you sniffing?
- What?

17:42.739 --> 17:45.360
- On the bus.
- You smell something on the bus, Eric?

17:45.534 --> 17:47.573
Yeah, Mrs. Linden's farts.

17:47.744 --> 17:50.414
We found chemical solvents
in your bloodstream.

17:50.581 --> 17:54.495
Some of your classmates
are really sick.

17:54.668 --> 17:57.160
Can I get another Band-Aid?

17:57.380 --> 18:01.959
I need to know what it was.
Butane, paint thinner, adhesive?

18:06.097 --> 18:11.767
Okay, fine. We'll do more tests.
Bo? Come here.

18:12.938 --> 18:15.773
- What kind of tests?
- Just lie still, man.

18:16.775 --> 18:22.197
We take the blood and label it
with radioactive hydrogen.

18:22.948 --> 18:25.570
Then we re-inject it into your body...

18:28.621 --> 18:31.456
- ... and do a nuclear scan.
- Really?

18:31.624 --> 18:34.080
It's the only way
to identify the chemicals.

18:36.337 --> 18:37.713
It was spot remover.

18:39.049 --> 18:41.207
- What kind?
- Carbon tet.

18:41.426 --> 18:45.839
Carbon tetrachloride?
Order liver panels on all three of them.

18:46.015 --> 18:47.841
Got it.

18:48.017 --> 18:51.433
- We gonna be okay?
- I hope so.

18:58.111 --> 19:00.234
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Rena.

19:00.405 --> 19:04.450
She's just finishing up with a patient.
Dr. Carter, right?

19:04.618 --> 19:09.411
- Yeah. Have we met?
- No. I'll let her know you're here.

19:11.667 --> 19:14.787
We didn't have- We didn't...

19:21.678 --> 19:24.085
- Dr. Carter?
- Yeah, hi. I...

19:24.264 --> 19:28.392
Don't worry about it.
This is always falling apart.

19:28.560 --> 19:32.605
Okay, actually, it goes like this.
Are you sure you're a doctor?

19:32.773 --> 19:34.765
I was a surgical resident for a year.

19:34.942 --> 19:39.271
I guess it's easier taking things out
than putting it back in.

19:39.446 --> 19:44.441
I was waiting and I accidentally
eviscerated this guy.

19:44.619 --> 19:47.620
I heard about the shooting.
Are you okay?

19:49.374 --> 19:50.453
Did you need something?

19:51.793 --> 19:55.458
I've been doing some thinking
about you and me.

19:55.630 --> 19:59.213
And I realize that I may have been...

19:59.968 --> 20:01.132
Stupid?

20:02.137 --> 20:06.966
I was gonna say wrong.
But maybe I was a little of both.

20:07.602 --> 20:11.101
Look, I enjoyed the time that we
spent together. I'd like to do it again.

20:11.272 --> 20:13.680
So I was wondering if you
would have lunch with me.

20:14.568 --> 20:16.026
What about the age thing?

20:16.194 --> 20:17.772
Not an issue.

20:17.988 --> 20:19.185
Anymore.

20:22.743 --> 20:25.199
You dropped your spleen.

20:28.582 --> 20:30.243
Right. So is that a no?

20:30.417 --> 20:31.877
I'll think about it.

20:32.711 --> 20:34.206
Okay.

20:34.380 --> 20:37.050
I was just up at grand rounds.
Why didn't anyone get me?

20:37.216 --> 20:38.794
There wasn't any time.

20:38.969 --> 20:42.302
She wasn't that agitated when I left.
What did she want with the gun?

20:42.472 --> 20:44.465
She didn't want anything.
She was altered-

20:44.641 --> 20:47.346
Dr. Benton, the cop is still
waiting for his sutures.

20:47.519 --> 20:48.681
Yeah. I'll see you.

20:48.854 --> 20:51.012
- Got the film.
- I have to get out of here now.

20:51.189 --> 20:54.191
You need to sit down. You were
unconscious from a car accident.

20:54.360 --> 20:55.735
- I'm gonna be late.
- For what?

20:55.903 --> 20:58.525
My gynecologist. They have to
harvest my eggs by 6:00.

20:58.739 --> 21:00.697
- Are you on fertility drugs?
- Yeah.

21:00.867 --> 21:04.200
I had 10 days of FSH injections.
And yesterday they gave me Beta HCG.

21:04.370 --> 21:08.036
Look, I'm ovulating now. There's only a
two-hour window to retrieve the eggs.

21:08.208 --> 21:10.248
I don't think that's
gonna be possible now.

21:11.044 --> 21:14.248
- Why, did I damage my ovaries?
- Head CT looks normal.

21:14.423 --> 21:17.377
We think you may have had
a small blood clot in your brain...

21:17.551 --> 21:20.220
...which caused you to pass out
and crash your car.

21:20.429 --> 21:21.710
But I'm okay now?

21:21.931 --> 21:24.766
We need to give you blood thinners
to prevent more clotting.

21:24.934 --> 21:26.677
I'll go to the clinic and come back.

21:26.894 --> 21:30.264
You need heparin now, which means
you can't have an invasive procedure.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.231
When I come back,
you can do whatever.

21:32.400 --> 21:33.811
I have to harvest these eggs.

21:33.985 --> 21:37.236
- Hold on. Who's your gynecologist?
- Her name is Dr. Alexander.

21:37.406 --> 21:40.406
Let's call her and maybe
she'll come here.

21:45.080 --> 21:47.037
What is taking so long?

21:47.207 --> 21:48.999
Have a seat.

21:49.585 --> 21:52.076
Did you do the test?

21:52.463 --> 21:54.955
- You are pregnant.
- I knew it.

21:55.133 --> 21:58.217
- What about the fumes?
- Shouldn't be a problem.

21:58.386 --> 22:00.544
Good. I want a healthy baby.

22:00.722 --> 22:03.593
Have you thought about your options?

22:03.767 --> 22:07.895
- What do you mean?
- Can you take care of a baby?

22:08.063 --> 22:10.436
Well, there's daycare in high school.

22:10.608 --> 22:13.181
And my mom can help out
until I'm in ninth grade.

22:13.361 --> 22:14.392
Does your mom know?

22:16.280 --> 22:18.569
- Maybe you should tell her.
- No. Don't tell her.

22:18.908 --> 22:21.613
She'll freak out completely.

22:22.912 --> 22:24.869
It's a big decision.

22:25.039 --> 22:28.955
No, it's not.
All my life I wanted a baby.

22:32.130 --> 22:35.963
She's a good cop.
Saved my ass a couple of times.

22:37.219 --> 22:40.174
No one ever wants to draw their gun.
She was forced to make...

22:40.348 --> 22:43.183
- ... a split-second decision.
- Was she?

22:43.351 --> 22:45.924
She followed the guidelines.

22:46.521 --> 22:49.143
They teach you
to shoot little old ladies?

22:49.316 --> 22:52.102
She could have shot anyone
in that hallway. You know that.

22:52.277 --> 22:54.733
All I know is that an elderly
black woman is dead.

22:54.905 --> 22:58.819
No, man. Lisa's not like that at all.

22:58.992 --> 23:01.318
I would have done the same thing.

23:02.246 --> 23:04.120
Yeah, well...

23:04.290 --> 23:06.164
Hold still.

23:06.501 --> 23:11.127
You don't know her. You can trust her.
She's a good person. She-

23:11.297 --> 23:15.247
Look. She's been raising two kids
on her own ever since her husband died.

23:15.427 --> 23:19.092
She's had it rough. I'm telling you,
this investigation goes the wrong way...

23:19.264 --> 23:21.672
...you could ruin a good cop's life.

23:21.850 --> 23:25.848
She was trying to protect you and
your patients. That's all she was doing.

23:26.021 --> 23:31.063
You might want to consider that,
talk to these detectives.

23:39.160 --> 23:42.660
I know she's in the middle of a
procedure. Page Dr. Alexander.

23:42.831 --> 23:45.701
Have her call Dr. Greene at
County General. Hold on, Malik.

23:45.875 --> 23:48.711
Yeah. The patient's name
is Laura Beckton. Thanks.

23:48.879 --> 23:50.078
- Robert Borsellino?
- Yeah.

23:50.255 --> 23:51.287
- This is Bo?
- Yeah.

23:51.465 --> 23:53.505
We need a ProTime,
type and cross for four.

23:53.676 --> 23:55.585
- You gonna admit him?
- Pedes ICU.

23:55.761 --> 23:58.597
- She's in seventh grade.
- They're emancipated for a reason.

23:58.765 --> 24:00.757
When they're pregnant,
you can't tell her mother.

24:00.934 --> 24:02.926
- She'll have to eventually.
- Yes, she will.

24:03.103 --> 24:05.226
Don't you think it's better
to tell her now?

24:05.397 --> 24:07.389
- Well, yeah. I do.
- So you'll talk to her?

24:07.566 --> 24:09.274
- What?
- Maybe she'll listen to you.

24:09.443 --> 24:10.723
- What room?
- Exam 2.

24:10.902 --> 24:13.144
I don't need this.
I can just go home and rest.

24:13.321 --> 24:16.905
- What we need is to find your parents.
- They don't get back till 8 or 9.

24:17.075 --> 24:19.911
- They have a cell phone or a pager?
- No. Don't even bother.

24:20.287 --> 24:22.245
We really do.

24:22.707 --> 24:23.785
Well, what is it?

24:25.668 --> 24:27.162
You're in liver failure.

24:28.046 --> 24:30.205
- How'd that happen?
- You need to huff pretty much...

24:30.382 --> 24:32.919
- ... every day to hurt your liver.
- People drink every day.

24:33.092 --> 24:35.880
This is worse. We have to start
looking for a donor.

24:36.096 --> 24:38.005
A donor?

24:38.307 --> 24:41.557
You could die if you don't have
a liver transplant.

24:42.269 --> 24:44.594
Is this another one
of your scare tactics?

24:45.147 --> 24:46.427
No.

24:49.819 --> 24:51.361
Mark, Laura's crashing.

24:51.529 --> 24:52.858
I'll be back. What happened?

24:53.030 --> 24:56.197
- She slumped over, stopped breathing.
- I should have heparinized.

24:56.368 --> 25:00.116
- Pavulon and sux. Let's paralyze.
- I don't think you have to.

25:00.288 --> 25:03.740
Number 8 ET tube, suction.

25:04.376 --> 25:06.701
No muscle tone in the legs either.

25:06.878 --> 25:09.631
Blood clot knocked out the
corticospinal tracts.

25:09.798 --> 25:10.913
She's a quadriplegic.

25:12.134 --> 25:14.210
How about TPA?
Maybe we can bust the clot.

25:14.387 --> 25:18.087
Not after a car crash. Pulmonary
contusions. She can bleed into her lungs.

25:18.307 --> 25:21.724
Dr. Greene? I took a message.
Dr. Alexander can come see the patient.

25:21.937 --> 25:23.929
Forget it. She stroked out.

25:27.317 --> 25:31.611
And you also heard Officer Kimball
ask the woman to drop the weapon?

25:31.780 --> 25:32.812
Yeah.

25:34.074 --> 25:35.355
What happened next?

25:37.078 --> 25:39.996
Mrs. Howard was startled,
and she raised the gun.

25:40.205 --> 25:44.501
- Pointed at anyone in particular?
- No, no one specifically.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.454
Okay.

25:48.548 --> 25:51.798
We'll notify you
if we need anything else.

25:52.093 --> 25:53.469
That's it?

25:53.636 --> 25:55.464
Yeah.

25:56.056 --> 26:00.055
- Something you'd like to add?
- Yeah, they could have grabbed the gun.

26:00.602 --> 26:03.806
- What makes you say that?
- She was a frail, frightened, demented...

26:03.981 --> 26:06.520
...elderly woman. She didn't know
what she was doing.

26:06.735 --> 26:09.307
- But she still could have fired it.
- Maybe.

26:09.487 --> 26:10.602
But?

26:11.489 --> 26:13.529
They didn't need to shoot her.

26:21.708 --> 26:23.500
- Was she huffing?
- No. No.

26:23.669 --> 26:26.504
I've talked to her about drugs.
But you never know.

26:26.672 --> 26:29.246
I don't think she does drugs.

26:29.425 --> 26:31.632
I shouldn't have let her go
on that field trip.

26:31.802 --> 26:34.091
- Why?
- She's been sick.

26:34.263 --> 26:36.671
She tells me she's been
throwing up every morning.

26:36.849 --> 26:39.091
Could that be gallstones?
My mother had them.

26:39.269 --> 26:42.056
Do you know
when was her last period?

26:42.230 --> 26:43.641
I don't keep track.

26:43.815 --> 26:46.188
She has a boyfriend?

26:46.694 --> 26:49.149
Is she pregnant?

26:49.696 --> 26:52.022
- That little slut.
- Mrs. Perault.

26:52.199 --> 26:53.908
- How could you be so stupid?
- What?

26:54.077 --> 26:56.069
- This is your mother?
- Yes. I'm her mother.

26:56.246 --> 26:58.404
If you're gonna sleep around,
use a condom!

26:58.622 --> 27:00.415
- He didn't want to.
- No need to shout.

27:00.584 --> 27:03.204
Who is the little bastard?
You're getting an abortion.

27:03.419 --> 27:05.626
- I am not.
- Yes, you are!

27:05.838 --> 27:07.878
- Leave me alone.
- Why don't we calm down.

27:08.049 --> 27:11.300
You can't take care of a baby.
You can't even take care of yourself!

27:11.470 --> 27:13.593
- Get her out.
- I need you to step outside.

27:13.764 --> 27:16.255
- I need you to mind your own business.
- Mrs. Perault.

27:16.476 --> 27:19.927
- Told you not to tell. She's psycho.
- She's not leaving here pregnant!

27:20.146 --> 27:22.138
Yes, I am. I'm having this baby.

27:22.356 --> 27:26.401
And I'm gonna be a much better
mother than you, you bitch.

27:26.945 --> 27:28.189
You doing your homework?

27:28.363 --> 27:30.818
- No, that lady brought it in.
- What lady?

27:30.990 --> 27:34.443
The really cute one with the curly hair.
She works in Pediatrics.

27:34.619 --> 27:36.529
- Oh, yeah. Rena.
- Yeah.

27:36.705 --> 27:39.112
Hey, we found out exactly
what caused your asthma.

27:39.291 --> 27:42.043
- You tell them I told you?
- Didn't have to. They told us.

27:42.211 --> 27:45.212
- They told you, or you asked?
- Either way, it's not a problem.

27:45.381 --> 27:48.216
They think I squealed.
Bo is gonna kick the crap out of me!

27:48.384 --> 27:51.005
Don't worry about Bo.
Everything is gonna be all right.

27:51.179 --> 27:54.595
- No. It won't. They saw me naked!
- They just saw you from the waist up.

27:54.765 --> 27:57.601
- They're gonna make fun of me forever.
- Listen, I knew a boy who...

27:57.769 --> 28:00.260
...was a little husky.
He didn't have many friends...

28:00.439 --> 28:05.481
...all the kids used to make fun of him.
So he spent most of his time studying.

28:05.653 --> 28:10.066
And he went on to college
and he became a surgeon.

28:10.241 --> 28:13.407
And at his high-school reunion,
he took out his scalpel...

28:13.577 --> 28:16.912
...and he cut the tongues off of
every kid who ever made fun of him.

28:17.082 --> 28:19.916
That supposed to cheer me up, doc?

28:21.128 --> 28:23.666
Okay. Help me immobilize
the small intestine.

28:23.881 --> 28:25.541
Pancreas is fine.

28:26.591 --> 28:29.296
- Take a look at this.
- It's a hematoma of the duodenum.

28:29.470 --> 28:32.885
Yeah. The bullet went through the
medial aspect of the second portion.

28:33.056 --> 28:34.599
You're kidding.

28:34.809 --> 28:38.557
Have you known me to kid? Okay,
open a pancreaticoduodenectomy tray.

28:38.729 --> 28:41.137
- He needs a Whipple.
- That's a five-hour procedure.

28:41.316 --> 28:42.726
I'll call in Peter.

28:42.900 --> 28:46.732
- No, no. It's my patient. I'll finish.
- No, no, no. No need to torture yourself.

28:46.946 --> 28:49.782
- I just need a bathroom break.
- A bathroom break?

28:50.617 --> 28:52.277
Well, I am seven months pregnant.

28:52.494 --> 28:55.411
Should have considered that
before you started.

28:55.789 --> 28:57.200
I'll be back in five minutes.

28:57.582 --> 29:01.747
Fine. Shirley, call in another scrub tech.
I need an extra pair of hands.

29:01.921 --> 29:04.412
- Okay. Forget it. I won't go.
- Go.

29:04.632 --> 29:06.292
No! I won't!

29:06.468 --> 29:08.875
Bovie, pickups.

29:09.053 --> 29:14.012
Shirley, can you crawl between
my legs and insert a Foley?

29:14.225 --> 29:18.473
All right, all right, go on. Go on. Get out.
Go on. Get out of here. Go ahead.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.068
Don't you need a cable or something?

29:25.237 --> 29:28.073
Nope. It just sends it right
to your phone. Done.

29:28.241 --> 29:31.195
- Okay, okay. Call me.
- Okay.

29:34.372 --> 29:39.497
- Papa Roach. That is so cool!
- Stuart, do one for me. Blink-182.

29:39.670 --> 29:43.619
- Looks like he's found some new friends.
- How'd you do that?

29:46.968 --> 29:49.045
Well, I guess it's a little late for lunch.

29:49.221 --> 29:52.008
- Well, we got busy with all these kids.
- How about dinner?

29:52.182 --> 29:54.471
I'll probably grab a Happy Meal
on the way home.

29:54.644 --> 29:56.850
Okay, I deserve that.
Now you can forgive me.

29:57.021 --> 29:58.053
I don't know.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.900
Come on. I'm starving.
You, me, a couple of big steaks.

30:01.067 --> 30:03.190
- I'm a vegetarian.
- Or Brussels sprouts.

30:03.361 --> 30:06.398
It's a school night. No, seriously.
I've got a midterm tomorrow.

30:06.573 --> 30:08.696
Well, I can help you study.

30:08.867 --> 30:11.406
Might have to pull an all nighter.

30:12.371 --> 30:13.913
So is that a yes?

30:14.081 --> 30:15.741
Excuse me.

30:15.917 --> 30:18.040
So where and when?

30:19.211 --> 30:23.423
Let me think about it. I'll call you
when I know something more specific.

30:25.510 --> 30:27.716
- I thought you were over this age thing.
- I am.

30:27.887 --> 30:30.010
So, what was that about?

30:30.181 --> 30:32.589
- Do you know Abby?
- No, but she seems nice.

30:32.767 --> 30:37.264
She's nice. Yeah. No, she's just-
She's always had this thing for me.

30:38.274 --> 30:40.397
You used to go out with her?

30:40.942 --> 30:43.944
She's got some issues. She gets
weird around other nurses...

30:44.113 --> 30:46.735
...and stuff, so it's probably best
not to let her on-

30:46.908 --> 30:48.865
Let on about us.

30:50.954 --> 30:53.160
I'll meet you down here
after your shift.

30:53.331 --> 30:56.830
- Yeah. Sounds like a plan.
- Okay.

31:03.842 --> 31:07.970
When you have a chance,
her family wants to talk to you.

31:11.309 --> 31:12.387
Peter.

31:12.560 --> 31:13.971
Hey.

31:14.479 --> 31:17.978
- Mrs. Howard's sodium was 172.
- What?

31:18.149 --> 31:20.819
She was delirious because of
profound dehydration.

31:20.986 --> 31:22.646
Did you check
her mucous membranes?

31:22.821 --> 31:25.193
I examined her abdomen
for post-op complications.

31:25.366 --> 31:28.366
- That's it?
- Well, didn't you examine her?

31:28.535 --> 31:30.824
I shotgunned her labs
and gave her to you.

31:30.996 --> 31:32.870
Come here.

31:34.125 --> 31:36.830
This whole thing was preventable.

31:38.254 --> 31:41.172
If I had recognized the problem
and started an IV...

31:41.341 --> 31:44.295
...hell, given her a glass of water,
she might still be alive.

31:44.469 --> 31:47.470
You don't know. Takes time to
make a diagnosis when we're busy.

31:47.639 --> 31:50.973
- She wouldn't have grabbed the gun.
- No reason for them to shoot her.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.930
You'll see a tube in her mouth
hooked up to a ventilator.

31:54.104 --> 31:55.682
Well, she's not breathing?

31:55.856 --> 31:59.060
The stroke affected the part of her brain
that controls breathing.

31:59.235 --> 32:00.515
Will that get better?

32:00.695 --> 32:04.395
We'll have to wait and see. Here.

32:05.241 --> 32:07.364
You can sit down.

32:10.872 --> 32:14.455
Laura? It's Greg.

32:17.213 --> 32:19.252
I'm right here.

32:21.717 --> 32:25.335
God, she's only 23.
How could she have a stroke?

32:25.721 --> 32:29.969
We think the fertility drugs
caused the blood clot.

32:31.060 --> 32:32.888
Fertility drugs?

32:33.271 --> 32:34.434
The injections.

32:34.606 --> 32:36.931
What are you talking about?

32:37.692 --> 32:40.646
I talked to her gynecologist.

32:41.071 --> 32:43.562
Your wife was trying
to be an egg donor.

32:45.284 --> 32:47.193
She was selling her eggs?

32:48.663 --> 32:53.953
There was an infertile couple
willing to pay $80,000.

33:02.052 --> 33:06.595
We have this little hardware store.

33:07.182 --> 33:11.262
Bills are stacking up.
Business is down...

33:11.770 --> 33:14.688
We're about to file for bankruptcy.

33:19.612 --> 33:22.364
I guess she was trying to help.

33:25.243 --> 33:27.152
I'm sorry.

33:27.328 --> 33:32.703
You didn't have to do this, honey.
You didn't have to do this.

33:44.764 --> 33:47.136
- Is Dr. Carter around?
- He was here a minute ago.

33:47.308 --> 33:50.559
Will you tell him I'll be late?
There's a new admission to the PICU.

33:50.729 --> 33:52.686
No problem.

33:55.066 --> 33:56.441
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:56.609 --> 33:58.519
- I'm Rena.
- Abby.

33:58.695 --> 34:00.771
- You're Dr. Carter's friend?
- That's right.

34:02.116 --> 34:04.441
I hope you don't mind me
spending time with John.

34:04.619 --> 34:06.362
Why would I?

34:06.537 --> 34:09.492
- Well, he told me.
- Told you what?

34:09.665 --> 34:10.697
About you and him.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.331
Me and him?

34:14.337 --> 34:16.376
I don't want there
to be any hard feelings.

34:16.547 --> 34:20.793
I understand how some relationships
take longer to get over than others.

34:20.969 --> 34:23.674
He told you we had a relationship?

34:25.014 --> 34:28.632
I find his honesty refreshing.
He's different than most guys.

34:28.811 --> 34:30.719
Oh, yeah.

34:31.355 --> 34:32.849
He's special.

34:33.065 --> 34:36.150
Good view of the heartbeat.
There's the head.

34:36.319 --> 34:39.522
"Explore new places. Even though
Taureans cringe at the thought...

34:39.697 --> 34:43.529
...of change, trust what lies ahead as a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. "

34:43.701 --> 34:45.362
- That's so perfect.
- What?

34:45.536 --> 34:48.538
My horoscope. What's your sign?

34:48.790 --> 34:52.041
- I don't know.
- Well, when's your birthday?

34:52.210 --> 34:54.748
Looks like you're about
10 weeks along.

34:54.922 --> 34:57.294
- So when will I have it?
- November.

34:57.466 --> 35:01.630
Early Christmas present.
Look, how cute.

35:03.723 --> 35:06.214
Babies are a lot of responsibility.

35:06.392 --> 35:08.266
I know.

35:08.436 --> 35:12.020
It's hard work getting up
in the middle of the night.

35:12.191 --> 35:14.977
It's easy if you love them.

35:15.151 --> 35:17.358
How old was your mom
when you were born?

35:17.529 --> 35:19.024
Sixteen.

35:19.197 --> 35:22.863
Maybe if she had waited a couple years
she would have been a better mother.

35:23.035 --> 35:26.369
I'm way more mature
than she was at 16.

35:29.334 --> 35:31.789
I'm gonna have a social worker
stop by to see you.

35:32.003 --> 35:34.329
- Good. I need to sign up.
- For what?

35:35.966 --> 35:38.042
Money. When my friend Gina
had her baby...

35:38.218 --> 35:41.089
...she started getting a check
every month.

35:45.267 --> 35:47.759
- Your wife wanted...
- Randi, any word from the O.R.?

35:47.937 --> 35:49.977
- They're still working.
- No, no! I said no!

35:50.148 --> 35:53.563
- We won't harm her in any way.
- Stay the hell away from my wife!

35:53.734 --> 35:55.976
Dr. Alexander, Mark Greene.

35:56.154 --> 35:59.025
Could you keep her
out of here, please?

36:02.243 --> 36:04.782
- What are you doing?
- Discussing his wife's condition.

36:04.955 --> 36:07.244
Right now you're a consultant.
Talk to me first.

36:07.416 --> 36:10.620
I couldn't find you. I was reviewing
her records when he walked in.

36:10.794 --> 36:13.464
You were twisting his arm because
you want to harvest the eggs.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.709
- I was presenting it as an option.
- He'll never let you do it.

36:16.926 --> 36:19.500
She's already given her consent.

36:20.388 --> 36:22.796
He just lost his wife. Leave him alone.

36:23.016 --> 36:25.305
She's gonna need
a lengthy hospitalization.

36:25.477 --> 36:29.261
And then round-the-clock home care.
That's a tremendous financial burden.

36:29.731 --> 36:31.439
Thanks to your fertility drugs.

36:31.608 --> 36:35.144
I don't think so. I've been doing
IVF for 12 years...

36:35.404 --> 36:37.148
...and I've never seen this happen.

36:37.365 --> 36:40.282
She must have a protein S
or an anti-thrombin deficiency.

36:40.451 --> 36:42.029
Those are pretty rare conditions.

36:42.244 --> 36:45.411
Not as rare as a vascular occlusion
from FSH.

36:48.502 --> 36:49.877
I'll send up the labs.

36:50.086 --> 36:53.537
There's an hour left to retrieve
the eggs. It's a 10-minute procedure...

36:53.715 --> 36:56.004
...but it'll give them
a nice financial cushion.

36:56.843 --> 37:00.711
Why don't you try and calm
him down, discuss the situation.

37:08.398 --> 37:09.512
Another Vicryl.

37:09.690 --> 37:13.688
- Why don't you go take a nap?
- Because I've got my second wind.

37:13.861 --> 37:16.435
- Well, it's about time.
- I'm happy to close.

37:16.990 --> 37:18.365
Be my guest.

37:18.533 --> 37:20.028
Skin stapler.

37:20.202 --> 37:23.737
Dr. Greene called again. He'd like you
to phone him when the case is over.

37:23.914 --> 37:27.497
How sweet. You are one lucky lady.

37:28.127 --> 37:29.918
Couple of ABDs.

37:30.129 --> 37:32.038
You gonna write post-op orders?

37:32.256 --> 37:37.049
- Yes. Leave the clipboard for me.
- Okay. Here we go. One, two, three.

37:40.223 --> 37:43.924
ABG in 20 minutes.
I'll meet you in Recovery.

37:44.102 --> 37:47.305
His brother's in the Waiting Room.
Can you talk to him?

37:48.398 --> 37:50.225
Yeah.

38:01.704 --> 38:05.369
Hey, Abby. Can you update
the tetanus on my foot lac?

38:05.541 --> 38:07.581
Sure, why not?

38:07.961 --> 38:10.203
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah. I'm peachy.

38:10.380 --> 38:12.503
What's wrong?

38:13.425 --> 38:16.758
I don't know, maybe I'm still
getting over our breakup.

38:18.930 --> 38:21.552
- You talked to Rena.
- Yeah.

38:23.061 --> 38:25.267
I'm sorry. I panicked. I-

38:26.188 --> 38:28.858
What did you say to her?

38:29.942 --> 38:31.567
- Nothing.
- No, really.

38:31.736 --> 38:36.979
Really. Against my better judgment
and everything I hold sacred in life...

38:37.200 --> 38:39.323
...I covered for you. So you owe me.

38:40.830 --> 38:43.450
- Thank you.
- Sure.

38:43.623 --> 38:45.865
Also, I told her I dumped you.

38:46.460 --> 38:48.500
You dumped me? She believe you?

38:48.963 --> 38:51.252
Of course she did. Why wouldn't she?

38:51.799 --> 38:54.586
Well, it's just...
You'd never dump me.

38:56.054 --> 38:58.130
- I would dump you like a bad habit.
- Oh, no.

38:58.348 --> 39:01.348
- I definitely think I'd dump you first.
- In your dreams, maybe.

39:01.517 --> 39:03.428
- I would dump you.
- No, you wouldn't.

39:03.603 --> 39:04.766
You're acting crazy now.

39:15.658 --> 39:20.154
- What's that?
- Pulse ox came off.

39:23.124 --> 39:25.497
That's it for the right side.

39:37.848 --> 39:40.339
She in any pain?

39:41.519 --> 39:43.393
No.

39:44.814 --> 39:47.352
Left ovary looks good.

39:56.410 --> 39:59.328
She wrote children's books.

39:59.538 --> 40:01.578
Did you know that?

40:02.708 --> 40:07.287
Those were our bedtime stories.

40:07.463 --> 40:12.375
I still can't believe this is happening.
She's had dementia for such a long time.

40:12.552 --> 40:13.832
I know.

40:14.012 --> 40:17.216
Usually she's forgetful or thinks
she's still living at home.

40:17.391 --> 40:22.018
But she's never been
agitated or violent.

40:22.395 --> 40:25.895
I can't imagine her fighting
with the police.

40:26.567 --> 40:29.188
So you're sure it's nothing
from the surgery?

40:29.361 --> 40:33.739
No, no.
Dementia is a progressive illness.

40:34.075 --> 40:36.946
Over time there's worsening
psychiatric symptoms.

40:38.913 --> 40:42.911
You know, it's been so hard
to watch her deteriorate.

40:43.126 --> 40:48.918
Even little things can lead to agitation.
Sleep deprivation, a bladder infection.

40:49.925 --> 40:53.673
- Actually, we think it was dehydration.
- From not drinking enough?

40:53.846 --> 40:56.171
There's too many people
at that nursing home.

40:56.390 --> 40:58.050
They weren't even giving her water.

40:58.225 --> 41:01.143
- I never should have moved her out.
- It was too much for you.

41:01.312 --> 41:03.638
I could have done it.
I could have cared for her.

41:03.815 --> 41:07.480
- I was the one who put her in there.
- This is not your fault.

41:11.156 --> 41:16.862
Thank you, Dr. Benton.
I know she appreciated your kindness.

41:23.252 --> 41:25.826
I was looking everywhere for you.

41:28.258 --> 41:30.665
Is that Dermabond?

41:37.100 --> 41:39.508
How's he gonna get it off?

41:39.686 --> 41:42.771
Maybe he'll find some acetone.

41:55.078 --> 41:58.743
Carter, could you pitch in
with some chart reviews?

41:58.915 --> 42:01.537
- It's okay.
- I promised Rena I'd help her study.

42:02.628 --> 42:05.202
- Tutoring?
- Yeah. It's a midterm, right?

42:05.422 --> 42:07.628
- Family Studies.
- Psychology.

42:09.135 --> 42:10.794
Good night, Dr. Carter.

42:12.262 --> 42:14.469
- Randi, could you call up to the O.R.?
- Again?

42:14.640 --> 42:16.218
- Yes.
- Don't bother.

42:16.393 --> 42:18.599
- I thought you'd never get out.
- Neither did I.

42:18.770 --> 42:19.849
How are you?

42:20.021 --> 42:24.185
If I don't get off my feet,
my ankles are going to explode.

42:24.359 --> 42:26.019
Did your patient make it?

42:26.194 --> 42:28.899
- Yeah. How was your day?
- The usual.

42:29.072 --> 42:32.488
- You save any lives?
- I hope so.

42:32.659 --> 42:37.452
- Thank you. That's wonderful.
- Dr. Corday, your dinner has arrived.

42:41.961 --> 42:45.247
"Nice work, Mom. " It's from Robert.

42:46.466 --> 42:48.589
Maybe we should
have someone taste it first.

42:48.760 --> 42:52.046
- I'm so hungry.
- Pepperoni pizza.

42:52.222 --> 42:54.760
- And ice cream.
- Cherry Garcia.

42:55.559 --> 42:58.679
Let's go with the ice cream first.

43:01.607 --> 43:05.855
I had the most difficult case today,
and I got through it.

43:07.572 --> 43:11.107
That's good. Have some.

43:13.828 --> 43:16.498
Now that it's over, I'm thinking...

43:16.665 --> 43:22.003
...why do I have to prove that a
pregnant surgeon can be competent?

43:22.421 --> 43:23.702
I don't know.

43:25.591 --> 43:30.882
I can operate until the day I deliver.
But what the hell for?

43:33.391 --> 43:36.730
So, as of now,

43:36.992 --> 43:40.192
I'm officially on maternity leave.

43:40.690 --> 43:41.888
I'm going to rest...

43:42.066 --> 43:45.899
...I'm gonna take care of myself
and my baby.

43:48.073 --> 43:49.104
No napkins.

43:55.581 --> 44:00.742
Mark, can I just sleep here? I don't
think I have the strength to move.

44:00.920 --> 44:04.254
I don't think I have the strength
to carry you.

44:05.425 --> 44:07.134
- Keep it coming.
- Sorry.
