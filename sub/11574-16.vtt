WEBVTT

00:08.259 --> 00:10.215
[KENZI] Bo!

00:12.180 --> 00:14.011
You slept in. How "me" of you.

00:14.098 --> 00:15.713
Kenzi, you're here.

00:15.808 --> 00:17.924
Interesting non sequitur.

00:18.019 --> 00:21.307
Yeah. I thought that you
were sleeping over at Nate's.

00:21.397 --> 00:24.889
Well, l have been dismissed while
he surprises me with breakfast.

00:24.984 --> 00:28.602
But I peeked and it's totally pancakes.
Of the chocolate chip variety.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.027
--Oh, yum!
--Mhm.

00:30.114 --> 00:32.196
Plus, a morning without my
favourite succubus would be like

00:32.283 --> 00:33.944
waking up to a virgin mimosa.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.991
Yeah, same here.

00:36.078 --> 00:39.491
Somebody was tossing
and turning all night long?

00:39.582 --> 00:40.788
You get any REMs, sweets?

00:40.875 --> 00:43.366
| just got a lot on my mind.

00:43.461 --> 00:44.291
[gasping]

00:44.378 --> 00:47.085
| see what's happening here.

00:47.173 --> 00:48.663
--You do?
--Yeah.

00:48.758 --> 00:51.340
You are losing sleep
over that Dark Fae-dar.

00:51.427 --> 00:53.543
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I guess.

00:53.638 --> 00:55.720
Look, you being you,
you have certain needs.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.762
And I don't expect you
to holster your honey pot--

00:57.850 --> 00:58.839
Oh, gee, thanks.

00:58.935 --> 01:02.302
But Ryan totally screwed with Nate.

01:02.396 --> 01:06.935
Yeah. I get it. And that was wrong.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.654
You eighty-sixed him,
so let's just forget about it.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.524
Yeah, yeah.

01:12.615 --> 01:14.776
Why don't you just go enjoy
your flapjacks, short stack, huh?

01:14.867 --> 01:15.856
You want to join us?

01:15.952 --> 01:18.694
And third-wheel all over
your sexy breakfast? No way.

01:18.788 --> 01:20.403
That is why I love you.

01:20.498 --> 01:23.706
--|'m stealing the maple syrup.
--Okay, love you, too.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.921
[laughing]

01:28.005 --> 01:30.621
God, this is crazy. That was so close.

01:30.716 --> 01:32.126
No, that was hilarious.

01:32.218 --> 01:34.880
No, she is my best friend.
I can't keep hiding you in the bathtub.

01:34.971 --> 01:36.677
What's next, my teeny, tiny closet?

01:36.764 --> 01:39.631
No, that's a good point.
We haven't done it in your closet yet.

01:39.725 --> 01:42.216
This is all fun and
games to you, isn't it?

01:42.311 --> 01:43.926
I mean, I don't think I can keep it up.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.602
Don't worry about it. That's my job.

01:45.690 --> 01:48.352
Do you have anything serious
to contribute, seriously?

01:48.442 --> 01:50.603
Yeah. Just one sec.

01:55.408 --> 01:57.194
Bubbly?

01:59.537 --> 02:00.993
Before we continue
with today's reading,

02:01.080 --> 02:05.119
I would like to ask Beverly Garner
to come up here please.

02:06.919 --> 02:12.209
This young lady, whose previous papers
have been anything but impressive,

02:12.300 --> 02:17.465
has risen to the occasion to write a
dissertation on Romeo and Juliet that

02:17.555 --> 02:22.970
I hope will be published one day in our
most illustrious academic journals.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.766
I'd like her to read it now.

02:24.854 --> 02:26.435
Beveï¬‚y?

02:38.534 --> 02:41.150
I awoke the other night thinking
of all the other students

02:41.245 --> 02:45.534
that have come before us and were asked
to write a paper on Romeo and Juliet.

02:45.624 --> 02:48.536
How we all equate the issues
in this text with our own lives.

02:48.627 --> 02:52.916
Our own star-crossed love.
How our parents just don't get us.

02:53.007 --> 02:55.464
But have any of you
actually ever considered

02:55.551 --> 02:59.544
that this might be a clandestine
book based on foreign policy?

02:59.638 --> 03:03.005
I give you the Cold War
in iambic pentameter.

03:03.100 --> 03:07.685
Two houses alike in dignity,
Russia, America.

03:07.772 --> 03:11.230
Their children, Kennedy, Khrushchev,
are forced to clean up the mess

03:11.317 --> 03:14.559
left by their ignorant, selfish parents.

03:14.653 --> 03:19.113
Mercutio dies. America nukes
are discovered in Turkish soil.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.067
Romeo slays Tybalt down,
the bay of pigs.

03:22.161 --> 03:24.322
And, I mean, this--
this is the ending. The ending.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.278
And I mean if--if the nukes had flown--

03:26.374 --> 03:28.239
I mean, this would have
been our very own ending.

03:28.334 --> 03:32.623
I mean, Romeo would have been just
dead and Juliet would have been dead.

03:37.301 --> 03:40.213
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

03:40.304 --> 03:43.216
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:43.307 --> 03:46.219
My love carries a death sentence.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.392
l was lost for years,

03:48.479 --> 03:51.141
searching, while hiding,

03:51.232 --> 03:55.396
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:55.486 --> 04:00.355
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.826
Look, my daughter's in hospital

04:06.914 --> 04:08.950
and the doctors don't know
what's wrong with her.

04:09.041 --> 04:12.078
Someone gave her something--drugs.

04:12.169 --> 04:16.208
There's a drug dealer at that school
and he needs to be dealt with.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.505
Let me get you some water.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.969
The doctor said something about--
about her brain activity.

04:21.053 --> 04:24.090
Like, well, she can't
stop mumbling nonsense.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.923
And even the
neurologist said that

04:27.017 --> 04:30.805
he'd never seen anything
like it in all his years, anywhere.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.935
What kind of drug can do that?

04:41.949 --> 04:43.155
What's the name of your daughter?

04:43.242 --> 04:44.948
--Beverly.
--And the school?

04:45.035 --> 04:47.742
East Lake.

04:47.830 --> 04:51.698
Mr. Garner, go spend some
time with your daughter.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.124
I've got enough here to get started.

04:56.255 --> 04:57.836
Thank you.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.435
Hey.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.517
Hey, you're back.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.233
Oh, hey, Nadia.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.655
Hey.

05:24.742 --> 05:26.653
Come on in.

05:26.744 --> 05:29.986
[LAUREN] Well, you were right
about that car, it's a gas-guzzler.

05:30.080 --> 05:34.289
Yeah. Yeah, she certainly
sucks it back, huh?

05:34.376 --> 05:36.458
Thanks. How was the trip?

05:36.545 --> 05:42.415
Beautiful. The food, the air, our room.

05:42.510 --> 05:45.547
The lake was magnificent.

05:45.638 --> 05:47.754
What we saw of it.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.258
Supen

05:49.350 --> 05:52.513
--It rained one day.
--I loved that day.

05:52.603 --> 05:56.141
So, how about you?
How are you doing?

05:56.232 --> 06:00.225
Good. I've been busy.
You know, things have been busy.

06:00.319 --> 06:03.277
--Busy's good.
--Yeah, it's good to be busy.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.229
[knocking]

06:05.324 --> 06:08.282
--Hey.
--Hey.

06:08.369 --> 06:09.529
Am I interrupting anything?

06:09.620 --> 06:12.282
--No.
--No.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.283
Well, what's up?

06:13.374 --> 06:15.831
A girl's father came to see me.
I thought maybe you could help.

06:15.918 --> 06:18.660
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah. Excuse us.

06:18.754 --> 06:20.335
Welcome back.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.207
It's a human.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.554
She had a complete
neurological shutdown.

06:27.638 --> 06:30.801
It's like her brain just stopped working.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.223
She's sixteen.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.050
She's a kid.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.681
--Fae related?
--Could be.

06:36.772 --> 06:39.184
She's still in |.C.U., but the doctors
think it's some kind of drug.

06:39.275 --> 06:41.982
Just nothing they've ever seen before.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.230
The Ash wants us to check it out.

06:45.698 --> 06:47.359
Whatever you need me to do.

06:47.449 --> 06:50.236
Go undercover... in high school.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.863
Oh, no, except that.

06:51.954 --> 06:55.242
Oh, no, no, I didn't do great with
sixteen-year-old girls when l was sixteen.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.492
You think I'm going to do any better?

06:56.584 --> 07:01.669
Oh, sad wolfie eyes, huh?
Chris Martin hair.

07:01.755 --> 07:05.668
Other girls could be in trouble.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.624
Okay, fine, I'm in.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.256
Good. How are you at English lit?

07:09.346 --> 07:10.722
Needs improvement.

07:10.806 --> 07:11.921
That's what you're
going to be teaching.

07:12.016 --> 07:15.474
No, I cannot do Jane Austen again.

07:15.561 --> 07:17.222
That's what I said when I left England.

07:17.313 --> 07:19.429
What?

07:19.523 --> 07:22.310
Is there anything that
I could do to help?

07:22.401 --> 07:23.857
Yes, actually.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.809
Can you check this girl's
medical files for me?

07:25.904 --> 07:27.235
Consider it done.

07:27.323 --> 07:30.611
|'|| just--|'|| drop Nadia
off and then I'm all yours.

07:30.701 --> 07:33.192
I'll get back to you as
soon as I know anything.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.823
Thanks.

07:40.753 --> 07:44.371
Well, if it is drugs, these kids
are not going to narc to a teacher.

07:44.465 --> 07:45.545
True.

07:45.633 --> 07:49.091
So, who do we know
who speaks teenager?

07:49.178 --> 07:51.339
Hola, bee-atches.

07:52.848 --> 07:55.760
What? Do |--do l have
maple syrup on my mouth?

07:55.851 --> 07:58.467
[bell]

08:01.607 --> 08:03.598
Okay, Kenzi, are you sure
you know what to do?

08:03.692 --> 08:07.651
Unleash all this coolio
onto the student population.

08:07.738 --> 08:12.152
Oh, honey, they're going to be
printing my face onto T-shirts by lunch.

08:17.206 --> 08:18.662
God.

08:22.878 --> 08:27.838
[chatter]

08:31.679 --> 08:33.635
[STUDENT] Some serious teacher.

08:36.392 --> 08:37.848
Hello.

08:40.938 --> 08:44.897
My--my name is...

08:46.110 --> 08:48.726
Miss...

08:48.821 --> 08:50.561
Well, you know what?

08:50.656 --> 08:52.692
Why don't you just call me Bo?

08:52.783 --> 08:56.947
l'm filling in for Ms. Phelps.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.495
So, what have we been learning?

09:00.582 --> 09:03.949
--Yes?
--Shakespeare. Romeo and Juliet.

09:04.044 --> 09:08.253
Excellent. It's my... it's my favourite.

09:09.758 --> 09:17.676
So... we have two houses,
they are sworn enemies.

09:17.766 --> 09:20.599
Got Romeo...

09:20.686 --> 09:24.599
...and Juliet.

09:27.526 --> 09:28.641
Yes?

09:28.736 --> 09:30.522
Who's Ryan?

09:30.612 --> 09:31.647
[laughing]

09:31.739 --> 09:33.479
[BO] Oh, oh, god.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.064
[STUDENT] Fail.

09:37.411 --> 09:40.653
I'll just... get this off of here.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.455
You know what? Change of plans.

09:43.542 --> 09:48.582
L-Let's park the romance for awhile.
Let's talk about something more today.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.503
[STUDENT] This is going
to be a good class.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.717
Okay, um...

09:55.804 --> 10:00.924
...the fascinating world of
werewolves, fact or fiction? Yeah.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.634
[laughing]

10:03.729 --> 10:05.390
[STUDENTS] Yeah!

10:05.481 --> 10:09.065
Whoa, she's acting all crazy
and it's not even Prom.

10:09.151 --> 10:10.357
How long has this been going on?

10:10.444 --> 10:13.151
Maybe since, like, mid-terms.
I don't know, before that.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.605
Look, I don't even know,
I'm just really, really confused.

10:16.700 --> 10:19.237
You're confused.

10:19.328 --> 10:20.784
It's okay.

10:20.871 --> 10:23.362
Look, I've heard about some
strange behaviour at this school.

10:23.457 --> 10:24.242
You know anything about it?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.531
See, that's what I'm
talking about, dude.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.787
It's like one second, Jenny's
all flirting, flirting, flirting with me

10:27.878 --> 10:30.210
and then the next,
she's acting like I ran over Drake.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.707
Who's Drake?

10:31.799 --> 10:33.630
The rapper.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.799
Oh.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.877
That's not quite the erratic
behaviour I was asking you about.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.805
Okay. Okay. Then you explain it. P.M.S.?

10:41.892 --> 10:44.258
Yeah, probably.

10:44.353 --> 10:47.140
What about drugs?
Any new drugs on the scene?

10:47.231 --> 10:50.394
Love. Love is a drug.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.020
You really got to get over this girl.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.020
But I love her.

10:53.111 --> 10:53.896
No, you don't.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.318
How do you know?

10:55.405 --> 10:58.317
Hundreds of years of experience.

10:58.408 --> 11:03.493
Look, kid, you're seventeen, you don't
even know how young you are yet.

11:03.580 --> 11:09.746
Just go out, play the field,
have fun, make love, be crazy.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.670
--Are you sure?
--Yes. |t'll do you good.

11:14.216 --> 11:16.207
Right. Right.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.213
Thanks, man.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.640
Hola, chiquitas!

11:25.727 --> 11:29.766
Could you please direct me to your source
of desperately-needed caffeination?

11:29.857 --> 11:35.068
Is that ensemble trying to share
some childhood trauma with the world?

11:35.153 --> 11:36.689
Excuse me?

11:36.780 --> 11:38.862
You heard me, bitch.

11:38.949 --> 11:41.440
Oh, wow. We're already at bitch.

11:41.535 --> 11:46.120
Ah, well, it's very nice to meet you,
Heather, Heather, and Heather.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.164
--What?
--Cult film, circa 1988.

11:49.251 --> 11:53.961
Your fashion sense, meet 2011.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.662
And why don't you
take those clown shoes

11:55.757 --> 11:58.134
back to whatever hobo
you stole them off of

11:58.218 --> 12:01.005
and stop trying to mix
outside your social circle.

12:01.096 --> 12:04.714
You did not just insult the boots.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.771
Oh, sorry.

12:12.858 --> 12:15.941
Oh, honey, it's about to get real.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.152
Listen, you're new here,

12:20.240 --> 12:22.151
so I don't want to come down too
hard on your teaching methods,

12:22.242 --> 12:24.449
but you can't just teach
anything you like.

12:24.536 --> 12:25.912
Stick with Romeo and Juliet.

12:25.996 --> 12:27.736
Well, l was just trying to stay
away from any discussion

12:27.831 --> 12:30.038
involving hormonal teenagers.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.537
Not to mention death and drugs.

12:32.628 --> 12:35.119
Especially with everything that's
been going on at this school.

12:35.213 --> 12:36.544
What exactly are you implying?

12:36.632 --> 12:39.965
The girl who collapsed
in my class, Beverly.

12:40.052 --> 12:43.419
Word is she was on some
pretty heavy-duty study drug.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.676
You're here as a
substitute for a few days.

12:46.767 --> 12:50.259
Stick with the chosen curriculum and
let me handle the student population.

12:50.354 --> 12:52.094
[knocking]

12:52.189 --> 12:55.181
Had to pull this miscreant
off one of my girls.

12:57.319 --> 12:59.901
Wait outside, l'll deal
with you in a minute.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.565
We done here?

13:05.661 --> 13:06.867
What happened?

13:06.954 --> 13:10.287
The chic clique didn't appreciate
my accessorizaton skills.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.911
Especially when I tried to pierce
Heather number one's nose with a pen.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.662
You're supposed to be fitting in.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.459
[DYSON] Hey.

13:16.546 --> 13:17.752
Did you guys get anything yet?

13:17.839 --> 13:21.206
A lecture from the vice principal and
twenty-seven invitations to the dance.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.166
--One delivered by soliloquy.
--Oh, nice.

13:23.261 --> 13:26.173
--You?
--A fist bump. Kenz, you?

13:26.264 --> 13:30.052
Well, l was attacked by rabid muffies,
manhandled by Coach Bitchy-Butch,

13:30.143 --> 13:31.223
and I got detention.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.972
We are not getting very far, are we?

13:33.063 --> 13:35.145
Teen angst--our greatest foe.

13:35.232 --> 13:36.972
You said it, sister.

13:38.694 --> 13:40.104
Hi.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.935
No sign of anything at the school?

13:42.030 --> 13:43.566
Nothing I could mark.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.739
Well, if Snoopy here
can't sniff anyone out,

13:45.826 --> 13:48.112
then there must not be any
Fae at the school, right?

13:48.203 --> 13:50.819
No. I can't detect any Fae
who haven't hit puberty yet.

13:50.914 --> 13:51.903
You're kidding.

13:51.999 --> 13:55.457
Chemically, their lack of hormonal
change makes detection impossible.

13:55.544 --> 13:58.411
Fae puberty happens anywhere
between the ages of eleven and sixteen,

13:58.505 --> 13:59.665
just like humans.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.839
I did, however, get access
to Beverly's medical records

14:02.926 --> 14:06.669
and prelusive blood tests indicate she
was definitely infected by something Fae.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.630
--Can you tell what kind?
--|t's nothing I've seen before.

14:09.725 --> 14:13.559
I'm running a search on my database
to see if something sticks, but...

14:13.645 --> 14:15.226
I know.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.599
We need to find out what
kind of Fae are at the school.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.182
--Yeah.
--Well, it's just a couple of Akvans.

14:20.277 --> 14:23.519
Nothing capable of this.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.898
I spoke to the Ash.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.447
Akvan? What's an Akvan?

14:27.534 --> 14:30.196
Well, in layman's terms, dumb Fae.

14:30.287 --> 14:31.868
They mature slower than most.

14:31.955 --> 14:34.037
Think I dated an Akvan once.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.955
I thought it was only because
I was adopted by humans

14:36.043 --> 14:37.408
that I went to human school.

14:37.502 --> 14:40.835
It's common practice to place
Fae children into the school system

14:40.922 --> 14:44.585
so they can study human
ways and learn how to fit in.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.133
It would have been nice to know
why I was such an outsider.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.380
I know.

14:48.472 --> 14:51.214
We are going to have
to do this the hard way.

14:51.308 --> 14:52.844
Torture the popular girls?

14:52.934 --> 14:54.390
For information.

14:54.478 --> 14:55.263
That, too.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.810
Question the infants, great.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.980
I think I've got to stay
away from Las Mean Girls,

15:00.067 --> 15:02.729
I mean, unless you guys want
some broken Plastics on your hands.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.196
Just try and fit in somewhere, okay?

15:11.119 --> 15:12.734
Actually, you're not allowed to do that.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.206
--Why not?
--Bishops don't go that way.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.246
Because of their religion?

15:19.294 --> 15:21.250
--What's your name, anyway?
--Earl.

15:21.338 --> 15:25.172
That's a great name.
Very redneck grandpa.

15:25.258 --> 15:28.591
So, Earl, what do you think of Beverly

15:28.678 --> 15:31.340
going all Beautiful Mind
and collapsing in class?

15:31.431 --> 15:33.513
What a total waste case, huh?

15:37.854 --> 15:39.719
Okay.

15:39.815 --> 15:41.271
Knights don't move diagonally.

15:41.358 --> 15:42.814
What's next, no body checking?

15:42.901 --> 15:45.017
I think it was stress.

15:45.112 --> 15:48.980
Yeah, well, it must be hard to keep up
with the mocha cappuccino slut squad.

15:49.074 --> 15:52.692
Yeah, and straight A's are barely
enough for a second-rate college.

15:52.786 --> 15:58.326
I can't really picture having the
stress of an athletic scholarship, too.

15:58.416 --> 16:02.125
Sometimes, pressure drives
people to do stupid things.

16:04.506 --> 16:08.169
Earl, are you telling me that
the rah-rahs are doping?

16:08.260 --> 16:11.047
[cell phone ringing]

16:11.138 --> 16:13.220
That's my dad. I have to run.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.012
Play again tomorrow?

16:15.100 --> 16:16.806
Yeah, sure.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.563
Bye. Good game.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.727
Cool. Human Jenga.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.985
No! I'm not going up there,
that isn't right.

16:32.075 --> 16:35.408
|t's wrong. Completely and
utterly and totally wrong.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.111
Why? You need a solid polygonal
base and a triangular face

16:38.206 --> 16:40.538
to meet at a common point.
What is wrong with you people?

16:40.625 --> 16:43.708
You're never going to culminate
into a single apex that way!

16:50.010 --> 16:52.626
Miss? Anything I can
do for extra credit?

16:52.721 --> 16:55.383
Lobster dinner, back rub.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.338
Oh, I...

16:59.644 --> 17:01.805
Lauren, I'm kidding.

17:01.897 --> 17:03.478
Right.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.101
What you got there?

17:05.192 --> 17:08.059
Whatever this Fae drug is
that's infecting these kids,

17:08.153 --> 17:10.439
it contains traces of embryonic tissue.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.690
What, like Fae eggs?

17:11.781 --> 17:13.487
Maybe.

17:13.575 --> 17:15.440
So, instead of looking for
a needle in a haystack,

17:15.535 --> 17:18.117
we're looking for what, a nest?

17:18.205 --> 17:19.285
Thank you.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.034
Bo?

17:22.125 --> 17:24.366
About the other day
when Nadia and I came by,

17:24.461 --> 17:27.498
she's not usually so
public with her affections.

17:27.589 --> 17:28.954
Yeah, it's okay.

17:29.049 --> 17:32.291
Just--l'm having a hard time...

17:32.385 --> 17:34.421
...hiding so much from her.

17:34.512 --> 17:35.547
Yeah, I bet.

17:35.639 --> 17:39.257
I want to tell her the truth but
how do I explain any of this to her?

17:39.351 --> 17:41.717
Our lives are complicated, Lauren.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.938
[KENZI] Gold star for Kenzi.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.979
Hi, Lauren.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.978
One of the cheerleaders
started shrieking.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.400
--Yeah, they do that.
--No, no, no.

17:50.487 --> 17:54.696
I mean she totally freaked out about
the integrity of their lame-ass pyramid

17:54.783 --> 17:56.523
not being structurally
sound or something.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.609
It was all number,
fraction, garble, garble,

17:58.703 --> 18:01.570
then she collapsed just like Beverly.

18:01.665 --> 18:02.871
I better get all the student files.

18:02.958 --> 18:06.075
I don't want to be playing
catch-up if this thing spreads.

18:06.169 --> 18:07.875
So, that's two intellectual rants

18:07.963 --> 18:09.794
and both Beverly and
this girl were cheerleaders.

18:09.881 --> 18:14.045
Yeah. And you remember that
crazy coach from Dickerson's office?

18:14.135 --> 18:15.215
Time bomb, right?

18:15.303 --> 18:17.544
Also, a little birdie told me
that they might be doping

18:17.639 --> 18:19.300
in order to get an athletic scholarship.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.382
Well, then I think it's time for me
and Miss Curls Are For Girls

18:21.476 --> 18:23.967
to have a little pow-wow.

18:24.062 --> 18:25.518
Yes.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.810
Hey, babe. Where were you?

18:29.901 --> 18:34.895
Oh, hey. Well, ljust had to
drop something off for Bo.

18:34.990 --> 18:37.902
Why are you working with her?

18:37.993 --> 18:40.484
Well, she's kind of a co-worker.

18:44.332 --> 18:47.574
Come on, let's do something.
Let's go somewhere fun.

18:47.669 --> 18:50.331
Yeah, like where?

18:50.422 --> 18:53.710
I don't know, like that
other lab of yours.

18:53.800 --> 18:58.009
Make love by the light
of a Bunsen burner.

18:58.096 --> 19:03.511
Oh, I would love to do that, but I really,
I do have to finish this.

19:03.601 --> 19:06.217
Aw, come on. You're no fun.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.268
Come on.

19:13.361 --> 19:16.319
Nadia, there is so much that I haven't...

19:20.160 --> 19:24.779
...you know, I haven't figured
out about this case and |...

19:24.873 --> 19:28.161
You know, you haven't
picked up your camera in ages.

19:28.251 --> 19:31.084
Why don't you take some
pictures of something? Hm?

19:31.171 --> 19:32.627
Sure, babe.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.308
Come on, give me something
provocative. Pull up your hair.

19:55.403 --> 19:59.567
Yeah, that is not what I meant.

20:02.535 --> 20:06.494
God, Lauren, you're so beautiful.

20:06.581 --> 20:10.699
Come here, come here. Come here,
come on, just humour me, humour me.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.081
Oh, it's gorgeous.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.543
It's beautiful.

20:17.634 --> 20:21.843
Yeah, okay, stay there. Stay there.
Don't move. Don't move.

20:23.723 --> 20:28.968
Look at me. Look... beautiful.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.472
Oh, that's great.

20:30.563 --> 20:33.350
Okay, hold on. Hold on.

20:33.441 --> 20:37.605
Let's just make this photo
shoot a little more interesting.

20:37.695 --> 20:41.438
Make these pictures
a little more beautiful.

20:56.172 --> 20:59.130
That's the old Lauren I remember.

21:03.805 --> 21:07.013
You know...

21:07.100 --> 21:11.764
...l really--| really
should get back to work.

21:35.879 --> 21:38.461
Excuse me.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.379
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

21:40.467 --> 21:42.458
I'm kind of in the middle of a set.

21:42.552 --> 21:46.966
Beverly and the other cheerleader,
any idea what happened to them?

21:51.144 --> 21:52.759
And what's your interest in my girls?

21:52.854 --> 21:55.937
Something put them
both in the hospital.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.481
I'm sure the situation is
being handled appropriately.

21:58.568 --> 22:02.186
Yeah, see, I'm just not so sure that
you're handling them appropriately.

22:02.280 --> 22:05.147
The doctors are
speculating it was drugs.

22:07.785 --> 22:09.366
You think I gave them something?

22:09.454 --> 22:11.035
I do now.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.618
You're in way over your head, honey.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.700
Yeah? Well, that's just where I like it.

22:16.794 --> 22:19.376
--Is that a threat?
--Yeah. Why not?

22:21.716 --> 22:24.879
Pretty little thing. I bet you
had all the boys after you, huh?

22:24.969 --> 22:27.085
I bet they were all terrified of you.

22:31.809 --> 22:34.095
Big mistake, teach.

22:42.362 --> 22:46.526
A few of my cheerleaders were
trying out for athletic scholarships.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.197
I helped a little.

22:48.284 --> 22:52.243
--Steroids?
--Small amounts. Unnoticeable.

22:52.330 --> 22:56.573
I bet they noticed. Anything else?

22:56.668 --> 23:00.752
Very low doses of diuretics
to keep their weight down.

23:00.838 --> 23:02.248
I thought I was helping.

23:02.340 --> 23:06.253
They're just kids. They look up to you.

23:06.344 --> 23:09.552
You have to take that as
seriously as your workouts.

23:13.434 --> 23:17.848
Whatever you're giving
them stops right now.

23:17.939 --> 23:20.521
For sure.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.473
Don't make me come back here.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.150
I love you.

23:25.530 --> 23:28.818
Yeah, I know.

23:57.687 --> 24:01.054
Hey, don't forget your
lunch there, buddy.

24:01.149 --> 24:03.105
So, where you off to in such a hurry?

24:03.192 --> 24:06.150
Trying to intersect the path of
a girl so it actually looks natural.

24:06.237 --> 24:08.478
Well, you should focus
on your studying, not girls.

24:08.573 --> 24:10.905
She's different. We play chess.

24:10.992 --> 24:12.607
Yeah? Is she any good?

24:12.702 --> 24:14.738
She's terrible.

24:14.829 --> 24:16.740
I may love her, though.

24:16.831 --> 24:19.573
Girls like smart guys.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.282
Go get 'em, tiger.

24:24.255 --> 24:26.120
Ready to play?

24:26.215 --> 24:28.046
Stoked.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.544
--Was that your dad?
--Yeah.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.501
--He drive you to school every day?
--Uh huh.

24:31.596 --> 24:33.052
Must be nice.

24:33.139 --> 24:36.427
It is. I never got to spend
much time with him before.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.382
--Before what?
--A couple of months ago.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.264
I made the school's
Reach for the Top team and

24:40.355 --> 24:43.688
I think he gets a kick out of it.
We're in the regional finals.

24:43.775 --> 24:45.811
Quiz show geek and a chess master.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.392
You the bomb, Earl.

24:47.487 --> 24:49.569
Vice Principal Dickerson
put the team together,

24:49.656 --> 24:51.988
picked me and two of
my buddies to be on it.

24:52.075 --> 24:53.110
We've never lost.

24:53.201 --> 24:55.283
You're proud. I can dig that.

24:55.370 --> 24:58.282
Well, I've put in a lot
of hard work lately.

24:58.373 --> 25:02.116
I scored a few A's. Now everyone
seems happier and...

25:02.210 --> 25:06.123
it really seems to
help with the ladies.

25:08.132 --> 25:09.747
Ahh!

25:09.842 --> 25:11.093
What the Earl are you doing?

25:11.177 --> 25:12.542
Sorry. I thought--

25:12.637 --> 25:15.219
W-Why would you do that?

25:17.517 --> 25:18.973
Okay.

25:21.145 --> 25:24.683
It was one of those fairly quick,
but wet and slobbery ones,

25:24.774 --> 25:26.856
you know, like when you're
kissing a puppy with the flu.

25:26.943 --> 25:28.604
Slobbery can be nice.

25:28.695 --> 25:31.983
I'm sorry, Miss Succubus, when was
the last time you had to kiss the horny,

25:32.073 --> 25:34.234
gooey, lord of the chess board, huh?

25:34.325 --> 25:37.567
I mean, clearly, his fame has
gone to his little head, as well.

25:37.662 --> 25:38.777
How's that?

25:38.871 --> 25:40.827
Well, he's been doing really
great for a few months,

25:40.915 --> 25:42.951
so Dickerson made him and
his buddies members of this

25:43.042 --> 25:45.954
winning brain trust or something.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.161
Huh, interesting.

25:48.256 --> 25:50.497
I'm still in post-traumatic kiss
syndrome. What's interesting?

25:50.591 --> 25:54.209
Well, Dickerson puts together
a team of recent geniuses.

25:54.303 --> 25:59.263
Beverly freaks out spouting Shakespeare
and Sarah blows a gasket over math.

25:59.350 --> 26:01.090
You're saying it's the evil
vice principal, aren't ya?

26:01.185 --> 26:02.800
Nobody ever likes the vice principal.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.886
Okay. You go check on his potency.

26:04.981 --> 26:08.269
I'll be in the little girl's room
chewing on a bar of soap. Okay?

26:11.362 --> 26:12.272
Hey, teach.

26:12.363 --> 26:17.528
Wha... What? What are you doing here?

26:17.618 --> 26:18.994
It's nice to see you, too.

26:19.078 --> 26:22.821
Hey, looking for a
date to the big dance.

26:22.915 --> 26:23.995
Ha, ha. Very funny.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.744
Actually, it's more the after-party
that interests me.

26:25.835 --> 26:27.917
The whole dance-corsage thing,
I think it's just foreplay, right?

26:28.004 --> 26:30.495
--We|l, I wouldn't know about that.
--The after-party? Oh, come on!

26:30.590 --> 26:33.002
|t's when you lose your cherry
to your very special first love.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.468
You really have to go.

26:34.552 --> 26:36.713
I promise you I will be
better than your first time.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.760
--No fumbling.
--|'m serious.

26:38.848 --> 26:39.963
Am I hitting a nerve here?

26:40.057 --> 26:41.513
--Look. Some people,
--Oh!

26:41.601 --> 26:43.011
they're just not meant
to be with each other.

26:43.102 --> 26:46.686
No, it's that some people
think too much.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.513
Listen, there is a part of you
that needs to be explored.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.348
You need to let it out. Just embrace it.

26:50.443 --> 26:54.812
I like you. ljust--
I don't like that I like you.

26:54.906 --> 26:58.364
I can work with that. Yeah.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.872
What's Ryan Lambert doing here?

27:10.963 --> 27:14.922
Well, no, he's--|'ve handled it. It's fine.

27:15.009 --> 27:17.921
He's Dark Fae, Bo. He has no
business being involved in this.

27:18.012 --> 27:20.219
He doesn't. |t's personal.

27:22.642 --> 27:27.181
Well, you are unaligned.
You can do what you want.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.387
I wasn't asking for your permission.

27:31.776 --> 27:34.734
[bell]

27:40.910 --> 27:45.495
I thought Earl really liked me,
but that he was just shy.

27:45.581 --> 27:50.826
And then I find out that he's
making out with other girls.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.785
And this is strange
behaviour for this Earl?

27:52.880 --> 27:55.917
Yes. He just changed out of nowhere.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.589
What do you think caused it?

27:57.677 --> 28:01.135
Hello. Obviously...

28:04.600 --> 28:06.181
...it was me.

28:11.691 --> 28:14.774
Look, it's not you, it's him.

28:14.861 --> 28:17.443
What if he was my soul mate?

28:25.371 --> 28:27.953
Does anybody have any real
problems at this school?

28:34.380 --> 28:42.219
Look, you're a beautiful,
obviously sensitive young woman.

28:42.305 --> 28:45.763
You're going to find
another mate for your soul.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.306
Okay?

28:49.395 --> 28:51.807
You have a girlfriend?

28:51.898 --> 28:53.354
No.

28:56.611 --> 28:58.397
Want one?

29:03.117 --> 29:05.904
Yeah, okay. I get it.

29:05.995 --> 29:08.156
I didn't mean it like that.

29:12.460 --> 29:14.416
I'm very proud of the
team I put together.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.585
I understand they're doing very well.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.788
The school has never had
this kind of success.

29:18.883 --> 29:22.250
The esteem we received for getting
into the regional finals is priceless.

29:22.345 --> 29:25.007
It must be nice for you, too.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.086
Meaning?

29:26.182 --> 29:30.016
Well, the team's transformation has been
rather remarkable, wouldn't you say?

29:30.102 --> 29:32.434
A testament to diligence
and hard work.

29:32.521 --> 29:35.558
I'm just concerned about the amount of
pressure being put on these students.

29:35.650 --> 29:40.110
Look, I've invested a lot of
personal time tutoring these boys

29:40.196 --> 29:41.857
and their families are appreciative.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.154
--I understand.
--Do you have any idea

29:43.240 --> 29:45.026
what these kids are up against?

29:45.117 --> 29:47.073
The cost of a college education?

29:47.161 --> 29:49.652
Winning this competition
could mean scholarships.

29:49.747 --> 29:52.739
|'m meeting with their parents tomorrow
to discuss college applications.

29:52.833 --> 29:56.701
So, I'm sorry if I'm eager to see
my team's efforts rewarded.

29:59.340 --> 30:01.501
Don't you have a class waiting?

30:10.518 --> 30:11.633
Hey.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.467
Salutations.

30:18.609 --> 30:20.315
What are you doing?

30:20.403 --> 30:24.271
Euclidian geometry.

30:24.365 --> 30:27.573
--Excuse me?
--Shh. |t's due tomorrow.

30:27.660 --> 30:31.619
Ah... Kenzi, you're
undercover as a student.

30:31.706 --> 30:34.823
You don't actually have
to do the homework.

30:34.917 --> 30:36.908
But I'm good at it.

30:38.587 --> 30:41.795
Did you know that you can actually make
a function out of essentially anything

30:41.882 --> 30:44.043
over a period of time?

30:44.135 --> 30:49.129
Not only that, but historically
speaking, Euclid's axioms seem so

30:49.223 --> 30:53.933
intuitively obvious that any theorem
proved from them was deemed true

30:54.020 --> 30:58.730
in an absolute, often
metaphysical sense.

30:58.816 --> 31:02.183
Doesn't that just blow your mind?

31:02.278 --> 31:04.485
Oh, it's totally blowing my mind.

31:04.572 --> 31:08.485
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

31:11.871 --> 31:14.032
Some modern treatments
add a sixth postulate,

31:14.123 --> 31:17.866
the rigidity of the triangle, which can be
used as an alternative to superposition.

31:17.960 --> 31:18.995
Oh, no, don't tell me.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.202
I think Kenzi's been infected by
the same thing as the others.

31:21.297 --> 31:24.130
For over two thousand years, they
didn't even call it Euclidean geometry.

31:24.216 --> 31:28.459
Just geometry, 'cause there was no other
kind. Kind of like Italian food in Italy.

31:33.642 --> 31:38.136
What are we going to do? I mean,
I can practically hear her brain boiling.

31:38.230 --> 31:41.188
Don't worry. I've got some good news.
I've made some progress.

31:41.275 --> 31:43.982
According to my tests, whatever it was
that infected those two cheerleaders

31:44.070 --> 31:46.812
follows a curve. At first,
there's increased brain function,

31:46.906 --> 31:49.022
that's the stage that Kenzi's in now.

31:49.116 --> 31:52.608
But after awhile, the substance
expands to overwhelm the human brain.

31:52.703 --> 31:53.738
That's good news?

31:53.829 --> 31:56.286
The more that we know about this thing,
the closer we are to stopping it.

31:56.373 --> 31:58.204
[BO] Well, how long did it
take before Beverly lost it?

31:58.292 --> 31:59.828
--[LAUREN] Two days.
--[BO] Two days?

31:59.919 --> 32:02.160
[LAUREN] I know. I'm hoping that
we can do better than that for Kenzi

32:02.254 --> 32:03.790
with the help of sedation.

32:03.881 --> 32:06.668
--This is incorrect.
--No, no, Kenzi. No, no! No.

32:10.763 --> 32:12.754
You had that saved, right?

32:12.848 --> 32:15.385
It doesn't matter, it was
based on a false hypothesis.

32:15.476 --> 32:18.138
You assumed that the infectious
agent could only bind to D.N.A.

32:18.229 --> 32:20.811
using standard transcription factors.

32:23.317 --> 32:28.402
She's right. No, no, she's right.

32:28.489 --> 32:31.947
The Ash's file showed the Fae
students in the school are all Akvans.

32:32.034 --> 32:35.026
But what if somebody gave them
something to make them smarter.

32:35.121 --> 32:38.454
That would explain the
supercoiling of the D.N.A. Hello.

32:38.541 --> 32:40.782
But how did the Akvans infect
the cheerleaders and Kenzi?

32:40.876 --> 32:43.913
Any number of ways.
Most likely somehow orally.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.665
But I'll need the source
of the infection.

32:45.756 --> 32:48.372
Okay, I'm on it. Take care of Kenzi.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.844
Okay, but Bo, Bo!

32:50.928 --> 32:53.715
Whatever this thing is, we have to stop
it before it spreads beyond the school

32:53.806 --> 32:56.047
because if we don't,
it could quite literally infect--

32:56.142 --> 32:58.303
Everyone, everywhere. I got it.

33:05.985 --> 33:08.852
Bo.

33:08.946 --> 33:10.026
I heard about Kenzi.

33:10.114 --> 33:12.446
Yeah. Lauren says that
she can find an antidote

33:12.533 --> 33:14.398
if we can locate the
source of the infection.

33:14.493 --> 33:17.860
--What are you thinking?
--Dickerson. He is hiding something.

33:17.955 --> 33:21.447
He put together an academic team that
went to the regionals out of nowhere.

33:21.542 --> 33:24.033
Even if Dickerson is
involved, he's not Fae.

33:24.128 --> 33:27.541
There's no way he could have infected
these kids without someone's help.

33:27.631 --> 33:29.087
How does Lauren say it's spreading?

33:29.175 --> 33:32.258
Orally. Kenzi must have--

33:32.344 --> 33:34.630
What? Kissed someone?

33:34.722 --> 33:37.054
Of the horny chess player variety.

33:37.141 --> 33:39.382
I know someone who
fits that description.

33:45.191 --> 33:46.806
[gaSPS]

33:46.901 --> 33:49.142
--Earl, right?
--Please don't hurt me.

33:49.236 --> 33:50.897
You kissed Sarah and Beverly?

33:50.988 --> 33:54.776
Yeah, but it was nothing.
I mean, I found someone else now.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.858
Kenzi. And you kissed her, too.

33:56.952 --> 33:59.910
--How'd you know that?
--Because they're all sick, Earl,

33:59.997 --> 34:03.160
--thanks to you.
--Kenzi's sick? How?

34:03.250 --> 34:05.286
Your grades have improved
dramatically in the last few months.

34:05.377 --> 34:06.332
What are you on, Earl?

34:06.420 --> 34:08.706
Nothing. I'm just working harder.

34:08.797 --> 34:12.039
You want to help Kenzi,
you think harder.

34:12.134 --> 34:14.716
What's changed in your
routine? What's new?

34:14.803 --> 34:18.921
I've been getting up earlier to review my
homework while my dad makes me lunch.

34:19.016 --> 34:22.725
What does he make you?
Show me. Show me!

34:26.106 --> 34:28.313
What does this have
to do with the girls?

34:28.400 --> 34:29.731
Eggs.

34:29.818 --> 34:32.150
My dad says I need the protein.

34:32.238 --> 34:33.978
--Where's your dad now?
--He's with Dickerson.

34:34.073 --> 34:37.816
They're talking about my
college applications.

34:37.910 --> 34:39.366
Let's go.

34:43.415 --> 34:44.871
Hello?

35:16.031 --> 35:18.989
What do you think you're doing?

35:19.076 --> 35:20.862
I could ask you the same thing.

35:20.953 --> 35:22.739
I'm calling security.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.162
I know about your team.

35:26.250 --> 35:30.493
Earl and his buddies,
they're all Akvans, aren't they?

35:30.587 --> 35:33.670
You infected them and created
your own little genius pool.

35:33.757 --> 35:35.167
What are you talking about?

35:38.345 --> 35:41.303
Or are you just living out your desire
for notoriety through your kids?

35:41.390 --> 35:43.597
No.

35:43.684 --> 35:45.515
Get out, Dickerson.

35:45.602 --> 35:47.558
Jed, what's the problem?

35:52.568 --> 35:53.853
Get out!

35:53.944 --> 35:56.105
I would listen to the
man with the hammer.

36:00.701 --> 36:02.282
Who the hell are you?

36:08.417 --> 36:11.580
I like your little friend.
Attractive accessory.

36:11.670 --> 36:15.458
I heard what you said.
What are you trying to do to my boy?

36:15.549 --> 36:19.292
You're Earl's father? You and
Dickerson are drugging your son?

36:19.386 --> 36:20.842
No!

36:23.432 --> 36:27.095
No. He thinks he just stumbled on
a goldmine of smart kids, that's all.

36:27.186 --> 36:28.642
--We're fine with that.
__IIWeII?

36:28.729 --> 36:31.892
Yeah, me and the other fathers.

36:31.982 --> 36:33.267
The rest of the quiz team.

36:33.359 --> 36:36.601
We are just so sick and
tired of being second-rate.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.653
This is a chance for my Earl
and for the other kids

36:39.740 --> 36:42.197
to change the course of Akvans forever.

36:42.284 --> 36:44.946
By artificially increasing
their intelligence?

36:45.037 --> 36:46.652
Forcing them to be
something that they're not?

36:46.747 --> 36:48.703
Well, if it gives him a better
life than the rest of us,

36:48.791 --> 36:51.658
then I really don't care how it happens.

36:51.752 --> 36:53.458
What are you pumping into your son?

36:53.545 --> 36:55.501
That is none of your business!

36:58.884 --> 37:02.047
Take it easy, big man, just take it easy.

37:03.430 --> 37:05.091
He's spreading it to
the human population.

37:05.182 --> 37:07.093
Yeah, humans? Who cares?

37:07.184 --> 37:09.641
What about when your kids
find out, huh? What then?

37:09.728 --> 37:13.562
Well, they'll never find out,
not from you.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.486
What are you giving your son?

37:28.414 --> 37:30.951
Dad! Don't hurt him, please.

37:31.041 --> 37:32.702
What are you doing here, Earl?

37:32.793 --> 37:33.908
I know what you did to me.

37:34.002 --> 37:37.540
Whatever he said is a lie.

37:37.631 --> 37:41.044
You let me believe I'm
better because of hard work.

37:41.135 --> 37:43.672
Hard work only takes
people like us so far.

37:43.762 --> 37:46.595
How could you do it, Dad? Huh?

37:46.682 --> 37:48.764
--Look, |-| just wanted--
--What?

37:48.851 --> 37:52.093
Have me think I'm something I'm not?

37:52.187 --> 37:53.927
Have me be the smart
kid you always wanted?

37:57.943 --> 37:59.774
I mean, look where you are, son.

37:59.862 --> 38:04.026
You look how things have
changed for the better.

38:04.116 --> 38:07.608
Was I so bad before?

38:07.703 --> 38:13.243
I mean, couldn't you just
love me the way that l was?

38:13.333 --> 38:17.576
How could you ever think that, hm?

38:17.671 --> 38:23.837
I could never not love you.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.428
Come here.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.266
I'm sorry.

38:38.775 --> 38:40.766
This is what made them smarter?

38:40.861 --> 38:44.149
A Simurgh is the symbol
of divinity and wisdom.

38:44.239 --> 38:49.199
It was said to have raised an
abandoned child to be a brilliant man.

38:49.286 --> 38:52.153
He gained his intelligence
from the consumption of the eggs.

38:52.247 --> 38:55.535
Talk about a study aid.

38:55.626 --> 38:59.335
Except the use of them
is strictly prohibited.

39:01.423 --> 39:04.415
The Akvans broke a
very serious Fae law.

39:04.510 --> 39:05.795
So, they'll be punished.

39:05.886 --> 39:08.844
To a point. Being a parent isn't easy.

39:08.931 --> 39:11.593
There ought to be a license
required to raise children.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.265
There's no magic formula.

39:14.353 --> 39:15.684
[laughing]

39:15.771 --> 39:18.262
[EARL] You're really good at this game.

39:18.357 --> 39:21.520
I take it she's back to normal?

39:21.610 --> 39:24.943
Yeah. Normal for Kenzi.

39:25.030 --> 39:28.022
Lauren was able to develop
a cure when she knew the source.

39:28.116 --> 39:30.732
She got it to Sarah and
Beverly just in time.

39:32.621 --> 39:35.738
Uh uh. Uh. Actually, you can't do that.

39:35.832 --> 39:38.448
---Why not?
--Well, 'cause it's against the...

39:40.337 --> 39:43.329
You know what? Go right ahead.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.211
My horse just totally
smashed your castle.

39:47.302 --> 39:51.045
I told you this game was way
better with body checking.

39:51.139 --> 39:54.176
You're letting me win
'cause I'm stupid again?

39:54.268 --> 39:56.975
Don't think that way.

39:57.062 --> 39:59.644
Besides you--you've a
lot of good qualities.

39:59.731 --> 40:03.849
You know, you're patient
and you don't judge people.

40:03.944 --> 40:06.185
Thick head of hair, too.

40:07.656 --> 40:11.240
Whoa! Whoa, whoa! That is not
code for "take another lunge at me."

40:11.326 --> 40:12.987
Oh, okay.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.364
Besides, you haven't even
seen my next move yet.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.411
I am going to take these two guys

40:17.499 --> 40:20.582
and I'm going to smash your
helmet guy right in between them.

40:20.669 --> 40:21.579
--Oh, man.
--How do you like that?

40:21.670 --> 40:24.036
I totally didn't see that coming.

40:24.131 --> 40:25.587
Yeah.

40:27.551 --> 40:30.338
| get the need for closure,
I do, but I meant what I said.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.294
This isn't going to work.

40:32.389 --> 40:33.629
l have no expectations.

40:33.724 --> 40:34.759
Where are you taking me?

40:34.850 --> 40:37.011
Just give me two minutes of your time.

40:45.485 --> 40:49.148
Oh. Wow.

40:49.239 --> 40:52.106
Thought you could use a good high
school memory, so I made you one.

40:54.911 --> 40:58.039
Yeah, not bad.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.284
That is what I like to hear.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.866
For someone else.

41:02.961 --> 41:06.954
Look, Ryan, I appreciate everything
that you've done for me

41:07.049 --> 41:10.587
and some woman is going
to find you utterly irresistible.

41:10.677 --> 41:11.883
--Thank you.
--But--

41:11.970 --> 41:13.506
--But?
--But it's complicated.

41:13.597 --> 41:16.464
Complicated? Why? Why?

41:19.686 --> 41:21.893
We're not star-crossed lovers.

41:21.980 --> 41:25.347
We're just two kind of amazing
people who really like each other.

41:31.823 --> 41:36.783
[music]

41:41.583 --> 41:43.289
Want to dance?

42:01.103 --> 42:02.559
You know, I never went to Prom.

42:02.646 --> 42:04.102
ReaHy?

42:07.984 --> 42:09.724
I hear it's all about the
after-party, anyway.

42:09.820 --> 42:11.685
Ah.

42:29.923 --> 42:32.335
I don't think we're going
to make our curfew.

42:37.222 --> 42:38.928
That was amazing.

42:44.271 --> 42:47.604
I'm going to hop in the shower.
You want to come?

42:47.691 --> 42:51.400
In a minute. I'll be right up.

42:51.486 --> 42:52.942
Okay.
