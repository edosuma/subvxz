01:10.958 --> 01:11.791
Come in.

01:18.958 --> 01:24.000
A bank or some place gives a man a loan.

01:24.875 --> 01:28.041
Sometimes people can't pay the money back.

01:29.083 --> 01:31.666
You see they’re too poor.

01:32.291 --> 01:36.625
They have nothing valuable
for the bank to take.

01:37.041 --> 01:40.083
So the bank stops asking
and just writes it off.

01:40.750 --> 01:41.750
Just like that.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.833
They call it bad debt.

01:50.333 --> 01:51.291
So?

01:51.375 --> 01:52.750
What do you think?

01:55.333 --> 01:56.541
About?

02:02.250 --> 02:04.916
A drug dealer’s world is a cesspool.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.125
I don't like this idea, so I want to help you.

02:08.416 --> 02:09.250
So...

02:11.875 --> 02:14.500
Do you think...

02:14.583 --> 02:18.791
...it’s right for a man not to pay
his debts just 'cause he’s too poor?

02:19.750 --> 02:23.750
I hope you know what
you're doing with these gangsters.

02:24.041 --> 02:26.166
In any case...

02:26.250 --> 02:27.833
...the banks have all missed something.

02:34.666 --> 02:38.458
Ask the one-legged beggar what
his other leg is worth.

02:43.041 --> 02:44.041
Oh by the way...

02:45.083 --> 02:47.000
...what do you think of my new acquisition?

02:47.083 --> 02:49.958
Previous owner couldn't run it anymore.

02:50.250 --> 02:51.625
It's cool.

03:26.291 --> 03:27.625
What'd he say?

04:00.958 --> 04:03.958
Randal, are you going to
tell me what Emmie said?

04:07.375 --> 04:08.791
Uh Randal, listen...

04:10.166 --> 04:13.583
...we're good with picking locks.
Quick in and out.

04:15.333 --> 04:19.083
But doing drug deals using
a loan shark’s money is asking for trouble.

04:19.958 --> 04:21.250
Know what I mean?

04:24.625 --> 04:26.583
I need more than this Lester.

04:28.333 --> 04:30.541
Way more than this.

04:38.291 --> 04:39.375
What?

04:39.458 --> 04:41.291
Look it's simple.

04:41.375 --> 04:44.916
It's cash for the rocks.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.791
Then we repackage the
rocks and sell to make a profit.

04:46.875 --> 04:49.833
Emmie gets his money back and...

04:50.250 --> 04:51.625
...we make a big score.

04:51.875 --> 04:55.958
A bigger score than we've ever had.
More than a month of cracking locks.

04:57.041 --> 04:58.166
Two months.

04:58.250 --> 04:59.541
Ten months.

05:00.041 --> 05:00.958
Hey?

05:01.458 --> 05:02.458
Hello?

05:02.541 --> 05:03.375
Look at me.

05:03.458 --> 05:05.083
Just drive the car man.

05:15.875 --> 05:17.250
We'll be fine.

05:30.750 --> 05:34.500
Months Later

07:01.791 --> 07:04.333
Damn it Randal,
don’t people lose weight in the hospital?

07:08.541 --> 07:09.500
Damn.

07:12.166 --> 07:14.375
Hold on. Last three.

07:14.458 --> 07:18.041
One...two...three.

07:18.125 --> 07:19.958
Do you have him Pam?

07:21.500 --> 07:23.791
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

07:25.250 --> 07:26.458
One, two, three. Lift!

07:27.958 --> 07:28.958
Damn.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.083
Chill, let me help.

07:32.291 --> 07:33.250
I'll do that for you...

07:33.333 --> 07:34.250
Wait Warren.

07:35.083 --> 07:35.916
Okay.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.166
Okay.

07:45.250 --> 07:46.458
I've got it Pam.

07:50.458 --> 07:51.833
Which one?

07:52.458 --> 07:53.583
On the left.

07:53.666 --> 07:54.875
The door's open.

08:01.958 --> 08:03.500
Anyway. Are you okay?

08:03.583 --> 08:05.666
Yes. Thanks Warren.

08:05.833 --> 08:09.000
It's cool. But if you need help again,
let me know. I'll be here.

08:11.166 --> 08:12.000
I can come around again.

08:12.083 --> 08:14.458
You know you want to come around again.

09:28.666 --> 09:30.625
So what do you think?

09:36.041 --> 09:39.333
We're on the waiting list for
a place on the ground floor.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.541
But we were lucky to get this place...

09:45.291 --> 09:46.458
...for now.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.875
Pam.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.250
Thanks.

10:21.583 --> 10:24.041
Now, if you win this season
of Om-I-Wêreld then

10:24.125 --> 10:27.875
huge prizes are
coming your way!

10:27.958 --> 10:29.375
Hurry up.

10:31.125 --> 10:33.500
Hang on. Don't look yet.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.333
I'm not.

10:42.125 --> 10:44.041
Okay. You can look now.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.500
Welcome home babe.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.458
Remember when we were
kids and I broke my leg?

10:57.958 --> 10:58.958
Yes.

10:59.041 --> 11:01.166
You were such a tomboy...

11:01.250 --> 11:03.458
...always wanting to play soccer with the boys.

11:04.791 --> 11:06.375
I was so bored at home.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.625
My uncle didn't want to give
me my crutches back.

11:08.875 --> 11:11.500
You kept stealing them to smack the other kids.

11:17.958 --> 11:20.750
You spent everyday with me after that babe.

11:23.291 --> 11:26.250
Telling me stories of the world outside.

11:29.500 --> 11:34.291
That’s how I got through it
without pulling my hair out.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.625
What's this?

11:48.291 --> 11:50.958
Something to help you get through this time.

11:52.083 --> 11:53.000
Open it.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.333
What now?

11:58.750 --> 12:00.250
Take it back.

12:03.541 --> 12:05.000
Are you serious?

12:05.083 --> 12:06.583
Yes.

12:06.666 --> 12:08.500
We can't afford it. Take it back.

12:08.958 --> 12:10.416
You don't even know what it is.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.083
It doesn't matter.
We don't have money for this shit.

12:15.875 --> 12:18.583
Can’t we, just for one day,
forget that we don’t have money?

12:21.750 --> 12:23.291
What the hell!

12:24.541 --> 12:26.458
Have you seen my legs?

12:27.375 --> 12:28.291
Hey?

12:29.125 --> 12:30.250
Look at them!

12:30.958 --> 12:32.875
I can't do anything. I can't work.

12:33.125 --> 12:34.458
Look at them!

12:36.500 --> 12:38.291
Do you know how much crap we're in...

12:38.375 --> 12:39.875
...and you're wasting our money on -

12:39.958 --> 12:41.125
Stop it.

12:42.750 --> 12:45.458
What kind of trouble are we in Randal?

12:45.625 --> 12:47.541
What are you so afraid of?

12:57.375 --> 12:59.250
Open it, or don't.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.833
I just wanted to give you
something to do when I'm not around.

13:30.791 --> 13:32.458
Shit.

13:47.250 --> 13:49.000
They say we’re in a drought.

13:50.666 --> 13:53.333
The water will be back in a few days.

13:56.041 --> 13:58.250
I can't take care of you anymore.

14:15.333 --> 14:17.791
I've never asked that of you.

14:20.833 --> 14:22.583
We look after each other.

14:22.875 --> 14:24.125
Remember?

15:59.625 --> 16:01.083
What?

16:01.166 --> 16:02.666
Nothing.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.333
Leave it.

16:24.541 --> 16:26.625
Leave it. It's okay.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.500
And this?

17:52.041 --> 17:54.375
Asshole.

18:05.791 --> 18:06.958
Hello.

18:07.041 --> 18:08.458
Light it up baby girl.

18:11.625 --> 18:12.875
Hold on.

19:00.041 --> 19:01.541
Shit.

19:03.166 --> 19:04.208
Randal?

19:04.291 --> 19:05.458
Yeah...

19:06.041 --> 19:08.166
...I’ll be there now. Go back to sleep.

19:43.958 --> 19:45.666
And now?

19:47.250 --> 19:48.791
What's going on here?

22:09.166 --> 22:10.500
Rubbish.

23:10.250 --> 23:11.333
Pam?

23:34.958 --> 23:36.541
Who is it?

23:47.958 --> 23:49.083
Boo.

23:50.958 --> 23:52.750
May I come in?

24:43.833 --> 24:44.958
So?

24:48.125 --> 24:50.375
What’ve the doctors said about your legs?

24:52.791 --> 24:55.291
Nah, it’s uhm not good.

24:59.041 --> 25:00.583
Yeah...

25:01.250 --> 25:02.833
...gangsters.

25:03.666 --> 25:05.541
I warned you.

25:05.625 --> 25:09.333
You just can’t trust them, my friend.

25:12.166 --> 25:14.041
They talk about money...

25:14.125 --> 25:16.458
...but they deal in blood.

25:18.875 --> 25:22.666
At least you lived to tell the tale, huh?

25:23.958 --> 25:26.958
I mean, look at your friend, Lester.

25:34.958 --> 25:36.458
Sorry.

25:52.458 --> 25:55.000
So aren’t you going to
tell me what happened to you?

25:55.875 --> 25:57.958
That drug merchant...

26:09.583 --> 26:11.333
What's going on?

26:14.958 --> 26:17.291
You must be Pam?

26:24.375 --> 26:26.458
Oh yes and this is Faizel.

26:30.250 --> 26:31.875
Randal?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.291
Something wrong with your phone?

26:36.541 --> 26:39.291
Oh no, the network is messed up here.

26:43.875 --> 26:45.541
Look.

26:47.041 --> 26:48.291
Just one thing.

26:48.375 --> 26:49.833
I...

26:50.666 --> 26:52.708
...am a reasonable guy.

26:52.791 --> 26:54.458
Ask Faizel. Right?

26:55.333 --> 26:58.458
And I understand all of this crap...

26:58.541 --> 27:00.791
...that you are going through my brother.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.375
But a deal is a deal.

27:17.958 --> 27:20.000
Where's my money?

27:22.791 --> 27:24.458
Come on Emmie.

27:25.291 --> 27:27.333
We go way back.

27:28.541 --> 27:29.583
You know I'm good for it.

27:29.666 --> 27:31.291
I just need some time, that’s all.

27:43.625 --> 27:45.000
You.

27:52.083 --> 27:53.291
Bad debt.

27:53.375 --> 27:55.875
Remember that little chat?

28:01.333 --> 28:05.125
Even the one-legged beggar
can still lose his other leg.

28:17.750 --> 28:19.625
You've got seven days.

28:40.125 --> 28:41.625
Tell me.

28:42.166 --> 28:44.000
Don't worry about it.

28:44.541 --> 28:46.250
How much do you owe him?

28:46.791 --> 28:49.000
Twenty-five thousand.

28:49.958 --> 28:51.500
I’ll get it back.

28:54.541 --> 28:57.041
So Lester didn't die in a drive-by?

28:59.958 --> 29:02.791
It had to do with drug dealers?

29:09.375 --> 29:11.458
What the hell did you do Randal?

29:13.166 --> 29:15.791
I had a good deal Pam.

29:16.250 --> 29:19.916
I just needed Emmie's money
to make it work. That's all.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.458
We would've been sorted for life.

29:24.750 --> 29:27.750
Could’ve taken us out of this shit-hole.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.041
Aren’t you tired of living like this?

29:32.750 --> 29:34.666
So you borrowed money...

29:34.750 --> 29:36.458
...from a loan shark...

29:36.541 --> 29:38.583
...to pay drug dealers.

29:39.583 --> 29:42.083
And got Lester killed in the process.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
We have each other.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.250
What more do you want?

29:48.333 --> 29:49.166
There's...

29:49.250 --> 29:50.458
Shut up.

29:51.583 --> 29:53.250
I have...

29:53.333 --> 29:55.375
...tolerated enough from you Randal.

29:57.375 --> 30:01.958
I’ve never asked you to be
an angel but we had enough.

30:03.250 --> 30:05.625
What's so bad about our life hey?

30:07.333 --> 30:09.083
We have each other.

30:10.458 --> 30:12.333
What more do you need?

30:17.083 --> 30:18.958
Put ice on your face.

30:22.583 --> 30:23.791
What's up Brendan?

30:23.875 --> 30:24.958
Yeah it's Randal.

30:25.166 --> 30:26.666
What's up my brother from another mother.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.583
I heard you're back from the dead.

30:30.250 --> 30:31.666
Damn bro. You're like Jesus.

30:31.875 --> 30:34.666
Like that bird...uh what’s it called...

30:34.750 --> 30:35.833
...a phoenix.

30:37.333 --> 30:38.458
Yeah a phoenix.

30:39.250 --> 30:41.208
Check it, I'm uh looking for a bit of work.

30:41.291 --> 30:44.166
You know...credit cards...

30:44.250 --> 30:46.166
That’s right.

30:46.625 --> 30:48.458
Cool. So you'll let me know.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.541
Come on Yazid, you know I can work.

30:52.625 --> 30:53.750
My hands...

30:54.250 --> 30:55.916
What are you gonna do
when the police come for you?

30:56.000 --> 30:56.958
Roll away?

31:00.958 --> 31:02.125
Roll away.

31:54.875 --> 31:56.875
Oh you’re back.

32:16.041 --> 32:18.250
So you're all tight.

32:59.750 --> 33:01.375
Here's the money.

33:02.833 --> 33:03.958
Is that it?

33:55.083 --> 33:58.875
Ten triple one, emergency line.
How may I help you?

34:01.250 --> 34:02.500
Hello?

34:05.500 --> 34:06.750
Hello?

34:10.958 --> 34:12.250
Hello?

35:43.333 --> 35:44.833
Water’s back.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.125
It's nice and hot.

36:04.541 --> 36:06.083
Good.

36:06.666 --> 36:08.041
The bedroom's getting cold.

36:14.875 --> 36:17.750
I see there's guys in Warren's block.

36:18.125 --> 36:20.458
They drive a sick BMW.

36:24.791 --> 36:27.083
The main guy's name is Lawyer.

36:30.583 --> 36:32.333
Why?

36:35.291 --> 36:37.500
We should call the police.

36:37.583 --> 36:39.791
You should've done it yesterday.

36:39.875 --> 36:42.083
He keeps money in there.

36:42.166 --> 36:43.958
Probably...

36:44.750 --> 36:45.875
...a hundred thousand.

36:46.541 --> 36:48.125
Maybe more.

36:49.291 --> 36:51.583
That's more than enough
to get Emmie off our backs.

36:51.958 --> 36:53.500
Are you crazy?

36:54.875 --> 36:55.875
We're not doing this.

36:55.958 --> 36:57.083
I have a plan.

36:57.166 --> 36:58.750
Lester is dead because of your last plan!

37:09.666 --> 37:11.458
This guy's no joke Randal.

37:12.458 --> 37:14.458
For God's sake, he lives across the block!

37:15.750 --> 37:17.250
We're not doing this.

37:18.333 --> 37:19.750
Promise me.

37:23.750 --> 37:25.250
Promise me.

37:34.333 --> 37:36.166
I’m selling these binoculars.

38:09.833 --> 38:15.541
<i>Warren, supper 2night?</i>

38:35.250 --> 38:36.750
Pastor White?

38:37.250 --> 38:41.625
I went to visit Lester’s family a few days ago.

38:43.875 --> 38:46.166
They’re doing okay.

38:51.583 --> 38:54.958
I've known you and Lester since you were kids.

38:55.875 --> 38:58.166
When you used to steal from the offering plate.

39:03.250 --> 39:06.250
I hear you've been selling
all your stuff to save the church.

39:08.458 --> 39:10.375
Yes. I wait on the Lord.

39:11.958 --> 39:14.250
He will provide.

39:21.958 --> 39:26.250
They build piles of shit
and tell us to live in it.

39:28.083 --> 39:30.375
Then they wonder why it stinks so badly.

39:33.166 --> 39:35.000
You see Pastor...

39:36.000 --> 39:37.625
I want to get out of here.

39:38.166 --> 39:40.250
Anyway that I can.

39:42.291 --> 39:47.333
So forgive me if I leave the
waiting for the Lord to you.

39:49.333 --> 39:51.625
He can catch up with
me when He feels like it.

39:52.583 --> 39:55.291
That's if He gives a shit.

40:05.750 --> 40:07.166
You know Randal...

40:07.958 --> 40:09.333
I'm praying for you.

40:12.333 --> 40:14.375
I know you're in trouble.

40:14.958 --> 40:16.458
But have faith.

40:18.291 --> 40:21.958
The Israelites eventually
made it to the promised land.

40:24.583 --> 40:26.333
<i>For sure :-)</i>

40:26.458 --> 40:27.958
Yeah...

40:28.666 --> 40:31.291
And Moses was dead before they got there.

41:02.625 --> 41:05.458
You're at the wrong place lady.

41:21.583 --> 41:24.166
Now you're at the right place.

41:38.625 --> 41:41.250
You're lying, you rubbish.

42:50.291 --> 42:51.375
There you go.

42:58.250 --> 42:59.166
Two.

42:59.833 --> 43:00.666
I'm watching you.

43:00.750 --> 43:01.958
Keep watching.

43:02.708 --> 43:03.541
Three.

43:04.250 --> 43:05.541
Double four.

43:05.958 --> 43:07.083
Two fives.

43:09.250 --> 43:10.375
Bullshit.

43:10.458 --> 43:11.458
Check it out.

43:13.375 --> 43:14.250
Damn it.

43:14.458 --> 43:15.541
Pick up.

43:15.625 --> 43:16.791
- Give me a break. Please I'm begging you.

43:16.875 --> 43:20.166
- Give me a break. Please I'm begging you.
- What break? What do you think this is?

43:20.458 --> 43:21.958
Down it.

43:26.958 --> 43:28.250
One more.

43:32.666 --> 43:33.625
Warren.

43:34.166 --> 43:37.458
Some of us have to work tomorrow so...

43:38.541 --> 43:39.375
...piss off.

43:39.458 --> 43:41.958
Leave the dishes, I’ll sort them out.

43:45.666 --> 43:46.875
Okay.

43:51.958 --> 43:52.875
Night.

43:52.958 --> 43:53.958
Goodnight.

43:59.083 --> 44:02.000
Warren you should come chill
here with me more.

44:02.083 --> 44:04.083
We can play cards. Get drunk.

44:04.166 --> 44:05.750
And you can lose.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.250
You miss him?

44:12.583 --> 44:14.250
Lester.

44:15.833 --> 44:16.958
Yes.

44:19.291 --> 44:20.750
Me too.

44:25.500 --> 44:27.041
Come I want to show you something.

44:27.625 --> 44:28.958
I can't see anything.

44:29.291 --> 44:31.666
Hello. Turn the knob man.

44:37.750 --> 44:39.375
There's Lawyer.

44:39.666 --> 44:41.291
Asshole.

44:42.458 --> 44:44.791
A woman came to your place today.

44:44.875 --> 44:46.666
She showed you a picture.

44:47.250 --> 44:49.333
Oh yes. Some missing cop.

44:51.791 --> 44:53.791
He's not missing.

44:55.125 --> 44:56.458
He's dead.

45:03.625 --> 45:05.291
And you saw it.

45:05.958 --> 45:07.583
So you called the cops?

45:08.000 --> 45:10.375
Is that why that detective is sniffing around?

45:11.083 --> 45:12.541
They were smuggling something.

45:13.250 --> 45:16.250
There's probably a hundred
thousand in cash over there.

45:16.583 --> 45:18.958
That Lawyer-guy, or whatever his name is...

45:19.750 --> 45:20.666
He kept it all.

45:20.750 --> 45:22.250
No way Randal!

45:23.041 --> 45:24.458
That's madness!

45:24.541 --> 45:26.250
Why do you want to fuck
around with a guy like that?

45:27.958 --> 45:30.333
Do you know that him and Spook
killed a kid last week?

45:30.875 --> 45:31.708
Who?

45:31.791 --> 45:32.875
Spook, man.

45:33.458 --> 45:35.791
That albino-guy that's always with him.

45:38.166 --> 45:39.583
Okay so...

45:39.666 --> 45:42.041
...this kid was selling on Lawyer's turf.

45:42.666 --> 45:44.625
But nothing big - small scale.

45:46.625 --> 45:49.000
So he's playing soccer with his friends...

45:50.458 --> 45:52.833
...when the BMW comes
speeding round the corner. Really fast.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.375
They run down the kid...

45:57.625 --> 46:00.000
They run down the kid in front of everyone.

46:04.333 --> 46:06.375
He gets out the car.
Walks up to the kid's mom...

46:06.458 --> 46:07.875
...and says it was an accident.

46:09.458 --> 46:11.041
A little kid.

46:13.750 --> 46:16.083
Why would you want to
steal from a guy like that?

46:18.458 --> 46:21.541
To tell you the truth Warren,
I don't have a choice.

46:24.041 --> 46:26.458
If I don't have the money by Tuesday...

46:28.666 --> 46:30.750
...Pam and I are done for.

46:42.166 --> 46:43.791
How are we going to get it?

46:45.666 --> 46:48.041
I’ll ask him nicely.

46:48.958 --> 46:50.166
Do you have his number?

46:55.250 --> 46:56.250
Put the number on private.

46:56.333 --> 46:57.916
Warren, I swear if you don't shut...

46:58.000 --> 46:59.000
Hello.

47:00.541 --> 47:01.666
Lawyer?

47:02.083 --> 47:03.333
Who's this?

47:03.958 --> 47:05.583
I know what you did to that cop.

47:05.666 --> 47:07.500
Is this a joke?

47:10.166 --> 47:12.083
Do you know who you're dealing with here?

47:12.166 --> 47:13.583
Who are you?

47:15.625 --> 47:16.875
A friend.

47:17.125 --> 47:18.666
I know about the money too.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.583
I'm phoning to warn you
before I call the cops.

47:24.333 --> 47:25.541
But...

47:26.458 --> 47:28.500
You could persuade me
to keep my mouth shut.

47:29.250 --> 47:31.250
Like I said, I'm a friend.

47:31.958 --> 47:33.166
Police?

47:33.625 --> 47:34.833
Police?

47:35.333 --> 47:37.208
You want to call the police on me?

47:37.291 --> 47:39.500
Let me tell you something,
whoever you are.

47:39.791 --> 47:40.666
Are you listening?

47:40.750 --> 47:41.791
You can phone the police.

47:41.875 --> 47:44.750
There isn't a mother-fucking
cop in this whole place...

47:45.500 --> 47:46.958
...that doesn't have a price.

47:47.041 --> 47:48.958
You can ask Meyer.

47:49.958 --> 47:52.166
Whatever deal you had with him...

47:53.541 --> 47:54.750
Who?

47:55.125 --> 47:56.333
Meyer.

47:57.250 --> 47:58.750
Your friend.

47:59.750 --> 48:02.000
It's strange you don't know Meyer.

48:02.500 --> 48:03.458
Goodbye.

48:03.958 --> 48:05.500
You missing your carpet?

48:07.750 --> 48:10.125
I never said the cop was my friend.

48:12.833 --> 48:14.625
Four people in a room...

48:15.458 --> 48:16.833
One's dead.

48:17.958 --> 48:19.541
Here's the problem.

48:19.750 --> 48:22.375
How do you keep the
secret between the other three?

48:22.458 --> 48:24.875
After all, people talk.

48:28.083 --> 48:29.750
I know where the body is.

48:30.666 --> 48:32.791
I know you killed him.

48:33.166 --> 48:35.041
And I know about the guns.

48:49.958 --> 48:51.333
How much do you want?

48:53.750 --> 48:55.166
Hundred thousand.

48:55.958 --> 48:56.791
Hundred thousand Rand?

48:56.875 --> 48:59.166
Are you crazy?! That's a lot of money.

48:59.500 --> 49:01.208
Put the money in a duffel bag...

49:01.291 --> 49:03.666
...and drop it in the bins by Block E.

49:04.458 --> 49:05.791
Then walk away.

49:08.541 --> 49:10.166
I'll know if you're watching me.

49:14.375 --> 49:15.625
You still there?

49:16.125 --> 49:17.166
Yes.

49:20.458 --> 49:21.875
Bins by Block E.

49:21.958 --> 49:23.666
Tomorrow.

49:24.083 --> 49:26.291
I'll call you when it's time.

49:26.583 --> 49:28.333
You say you're a friend.

49:29.250 --> 49:31.958
Meyer also said he was a friend,
until he got too greedy.

49:32.250 --> 49:36.166
He became a greedy little pig.
And I don't like greedy little pigs.

49:36.625 --> 49:39.833
You're like a disease eating
away at my business.

49:40.791 --> 49:43.625
Are you a greedy little pig...

49:44.250 --> 49:45.333
...friend?

49:45.541 --> 49:48.750
Drop it in the bins and walk away.

50:05.500 --> 50:07.458
How are we going to pick up the money?

50:08.375 --> 50:11.000
I can't just walk over there and take it out.

50:11.500 --> 50:13.250
You won't.

50:13.500 --> 50:15.500
You'll already be in the bin waiting.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.708
- Listen asshole, do you think
I'm going to get in a dirty bin -

50:23.791 --> 50:25.125
- Watch yourself Warren.

50:26.333 --> 50:28.125
I might be in a wheelchair...

50:28.375 --> 50:30.250
...but don't mess with me.

50:34.458 --> 50:36.291
You asked for 50-50.

50:36.833 --> 50:38.458
So this is how you earn it.

50:41.250 --> 50:44.000
You didn't have to do that. I was just joking.

50:45.583 --> 50:47.250
But seriously...

50:48.541 --> 50:50.125
...does it have to be tomorrow?

50:58.041 --> 51:01.500
You know I wouldn't let
anything happen to you.

51:01.750 --> 51:02.833
Right?

51:06.958 --> 51:08.166
Baby?

51:10.625 --> 51:12.250
I'm going to beg my boss for a loan...

51:13.250 --> 51:14.625
...to pay Emmie back.

51:16.250 --> 51:18.375
Then we're done with this criminal shit.

51:26.375 --> 51:28.625
You'll get a normal job.

51:30.333 --> 51:32.083
Make honest money.

51:32.875 --> 51:34.958
We'll never be rich...

51:35.500 --> 51:36.750
...but we'll be happy.

51:37.375 --> 51:38.875
Can you do that?

51:46.625 --> 51:52.458
<i>I'm in da bins, da kids
knw wat 2 do. Ready</i>

52:17.625 --> 52:19.041
Bins by Block E.

52:19.375 --> 52:21.333
Drop it and walk away.

52:22.250 --> 52:23.541
Do it now.

52:54.750 --> 52:55.625
Oh yes.

54:25.041 --> 54:27.541
Come on boys.
You know what to do.

54:27.625 --> 54:30.291
Do what you need to do.

54:37.458 --> 54:39.250
There you go.

54:43.458 --> 54:44.500
Run!

55:37.458 --> 55:42.500
<i>Dd u get it?!!</i>

55:55.291 --> 55:57.500
Lindsey lent me two thousand cash.

55:57.875 --> 55:59.125
Can you believe it?

55:59.583 --> 56:00.666
And...

56:01.000 --> 56:03.250
...I made some good tips.

56:03.750 --> 56:05.750
I think we need to speak to Emmie.

56:05.833 --> 56:07.750
We can ask to pay him a bit at a time.

56:09.125 --> 56:10.875
I'm sure he'll understand.

56:11.750 --> 56:12.958
What do you think?

56:15.000 --> 56:16.041
What?

56:16.958 --> 56:18.375
What did you do?

56:19.333 --> 56:20.458
<i>- Come 2 window.</i>
- Randal?

56:23.291 --> 56:24.500
I...uhm...

56:26.000 --> 56:27.500
...I want to show you something.

56:29.625 --> 56:31.000
Come.

56:34.458 --> 56:36.250
<i>K @ window</i>

56:51.333 --> 56:52.625
What the fuck?

56:56.750 --> 56:58.750
Where did he get it?

57:17.000 --> 57:18.166
Randal?

57:18.583 --> 57:21.000
Tell me that's not Lawyer's money.

57:22.291 --> 57:23.875
You promised me!

57:26.291 --> 57:27.875
Do you realize what you've done?

57:28.041 --> 57:29.875
Why do I keep trusting you?

57:30.083 --> 57:31.666
Oh my God, I can't believe...

57:31.750 --> 57:33.083
...you promised me!

57:33.166 --> 57:34.291
I had to do it.

57:34.375 --> 57:35.500
We've got the money.

57:35.750 --> 57:37.166
We don't have the money.
Are you crazy?

57:37.250 --> 57:38.916
- It's not our money.
- We do have the money.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.625
Calm down. Calm down.

57:41.958 --> 57:43.583
I didn't have a choice.

57:44.291 --> 57:46.791
Emmie will kill us.

57:48.250 --> 57:49.875
He will.

58:05.375 --> 58:07.000
We're okay baby.

58:07.500 --> 58:09.833
We're alright. Promise.
Look there, we have the money.

58:13.250 --> 58:15.166
You're going to get us all killed.

58:15.250 --> 58:16.833
No I won't.

58:17.791 --> 58:19.375
I saved us.

58:34.250 --> 58:35.500
Okay.

58:35.833 --> 58:37.125
Now what?

58:43.958 --> 58:50.625
<i>Come round...We'll celebrate</i>

58:53.000 --> 58:54.666
<i>Why dnt u come round?</i>

58:54.750 --> 58:56.458
What's he saying?
When is he bringing it?

59:01.291 --> 59:07.750
<i>Lol. Seriously I want to feel it</i>

59:13.541 --> 59:16.375
<i>Nah, dnt grand walking</i>

<i>K. 60-40. But she fetches it.
Or I'm gone with it all 2moro ;-)</i>

1:00:22.125 --> 1:00:23.958
He wants you to go fetch it.

1:00:28.041 --> 1:00:29.458
Why does he want you to fetch it?

1:00:29.750 --> 1:00:30.583
What?

1:00:30.666 --> 1:00:33.041
Why does he want you to fetch it?

1:00:33.125 --> 1:00:35.083
I've been watching you two for a while.

1:00:35.791 --> 1:00:37.166
I'm not stupid.

1:00:37.250 --> 1:00:38.166
Is this a joke?

1:00:38.250 --> 1:00:40.458
Don't talk shit to me.

1:00:40.958 --> 1:00:42.208
What's going on between you two?

1:00:42.291 --> 1:00:43.125
Are you serious?

1:00:43.208 --> 1:00:44.041
Yes. I'm serious.

1:00:44.125 --> 1:00:45.166
You're full of shit.

1:00:45.583 --> 1:00:46.500
Pam!

1:00:53.333 --> 1:00:54.250
Pam!

1:01:01.125 --> 1:01:02.041
Pam!

1:01:04.041 --> 1:01:07.333
Hey, shut the hell up man!

1:01:28.458 --> 1:01:33.750
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1:04:40.458 --> 1:04:41.958
Do you think it's gonna rain?

1:04:54.833 --> 1:04:56.291
Are you gonna ask?

1:04:58.791 --> 1:05:00.125
Ask what?

1:05:01.958 --> 1:05:03.791
What happened with me and Warren.

1:05:09.041 --> 1:05:10.458
No.

1:05:17.250 --> 1:05:19.583
We're in hell and we
don't even know it.

1:05:22.291 --> 1:05:24.958
Money, money, money, money.

1:05:26.291 --> 1:05:29.250
Money is the devil we keep
chasing in the hope of something better.

1:05:30.875 --> 1:05:32.083
But actually...

1:05:33.833 --> 1:05:36.583
...actually we're all chained to it.

1:06:03.125 --> 1:06:04.375
Okay.

1:06:05.250 --> 1:06:06.750
I'll be right back.

1:07:51.750 --> 1:07:53.333
We'll go in while he's away.

1:07:55.958 --> 1:07:57.875
You mean break in.

1:08:04.625 --> 1:08:07.041
We could always just pop Emmie.

1:08:19.958 --> 1:08:23.958
<i>Cum luk at my new ride.</i>

1:08:27.750 --> 1:08:28.958
What the hell.

1:08:43.333 --> 1:08:45.125
This guy's an idiot.

1:09:10.875 --> 1:09:12.541
He's gonna get us all killed!

1:09:19.375 --> 1:09:21.791
<i>I like it when you call me Big Poppa.</i>

1:09:21.875 --> 1:09:23.250
Yo bitch!

1:09:23.333 --> 1:09:25.166
What the hell are you doing?

1:09:25.250 --> 1:09:27.250
By the way. Check out my jacket.
You like it?

1:09:27.458 --> 1:09:28.875
Are you stupid?

1:09:28.958 --> 1:09:30.666
Are you trying to get us all killed?

1:09:30.750 --> 1:09:33.458
What I do with my money
is my business.

1:09:33.541 --> 1:09:35.125
You got your share.

1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:37.291
Where're they going?

1:09:53.541 --> 1:09:54.458
Randal...

1:09:54.625 --> 1:09:55.958
...something’s up.

1:10:08.958 --> 1:10:11.458
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
Pick up your phone!

1:10:12.291 --> 1:10:13.500
Warren.

1:10:14.083 --> 1:10:15.125
C'mon!

1:10:23.291 --> 1:10:24.541
Why's he not picking up?

1:10:29.041 --> 1:10:30.250
Randal.

1:10:30.541 --> 1:10:31.750
They're gonna kill him.

1:10:36.041 --> 1:10:37.333
Stop it.

1:10:39.458 --> 1:10:40.750
Stop it.

1:10:41.250 --> 1:10:42.250
Warren!

1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:47.000
Stop.

1:10:47.750 --> 1:10:48.833
Run.

1:10:49.750 --> 1:10:50.750
Run, Warren.

1:11:39.458 --> 1:11:41.250
We should've gone to the police -

1:12:19.166 --> 1:12:20.333
Randal Hendricks?

1:12:21.666 --> 1:12:23.291
Lieutenant-Colonel Gail February.

1:12:23.375 --> 1:12:24.875
I have a few questions for you.

1:12:26.083 --> 1:12:27.333
May I come in?

1:12:39.375 --> 1:12:40.750
Your wife?

1:12:41.583 --> 1:12:43.458
Girlfriend. She's not here right now.

1:12:44.166 --> 1:12:45.375
You're here about Warren.

1:12:46.083 --> 1:12:48.458
Can you think of anyone
who would want him dead?

1:12:54.541 --> 1:12:56.625
Mr. Hendricks, I'm not going
to beat around the bush.

1:12:58.958 --> 1:13:02.750
You called Warren just before he died
and you had a brief conversation.

1:13:03.333 --> 1:13:05.416
You called again a few minutes later...

1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:07.083
...but he didn't answer.

1:13:08.250 --> 1:13:12.083
Presumably because he was
being murdered at the time.

1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:14.583
Is there a question there?

1:13:15.041 --> 1:13:16.291
What did you talk about?

1:13:17.375 --> 1:13:20.583
I told him to come around for supper.
I can't exactly go to him.

1:13:22.541 --> 1:13:23.791
Hobby?

1:13:24.083 --> 1:13:27.250
My girlfriend got it for me. I like pigeons.

1:13:32.958 --> 1:13:34.083
Come to window.

1:13:34.666 --> 1:13:36.250
Okay at window.

1:13:36.791 --> 1:13:38.625
Come around. We can celebrate.

1:13:39.250 --> 1:13:40.750
Why don't you come around?

1:13:41.375 --> 1:13:43.958
Laugh out loud. Seriously I want to feel it!

1:13:44.958 --> 1:13:46.458
Nah I don't feel like walking.

1:13:46.958 --> 1:13:48.250
Hey don't be a cu...

1:13:50.291 --> 1:13:52.458
It gets pretty heated towards the end.

1:13:53.583 --> 1:13:55.583
Want to tell me what
you were talking about?

1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:57.666
Am I a suspect Lieutenant?

1:14:10.166 --> 1:14:12.250
Have you seen him before?

1:14:13.250 --> 1:14:15.458
My partner, Lieutenant-Colonel Meyer.

1:14:22.541 --> 1:14:24.458
Sorry I've never seen him before.

1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:31.958
Thanks for your time, Mr. Hendricks.

1:14:33.083 --> 1:14:35.458
If you think of anything...

1:14:38.041 --> 1:14:39.250
...call me.

1:14:42.125 --> 1:14:43.541
You're not from around here, are you?

1:14:44.666 --> 1:14:46.500
We don't call the police here.

1:14:46.833 --> 1:14:47.875
Know why?

1:14:48.791 --> 1:14:50.666
You're all just as bad as us.

1:14:51.125 --> 1:14:52.333
Not all of us.

1:15:04.458 --> 1:15:06.458
That guy Randal knows
more than he's letting on.

1:15:06.541 --> 1:15:07.375
Is it?

1:15:08.333 --> 1:15:09.916
When I showed him Meyer's picture...

1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:12.750
- I could see he knows something.
- Gail.

1:15:13.833 --> 1:15:16.250
Pastor White. Uhm...thanks.

1:15:22.250 --> 1:15:24.291
I've done something.

1:15:27.791 --> 1:15:29.458
I've done something terrible.

1:15:44.541 --> 1:15:45.458
Here.

1:15:45.625 --> 1:15:46.833
Time's up.

1:15:51.250 --> 1:15:52.166
Come on.

1:16:01.750 --> 1:16:04.250
Shit, I forgot Lindsey's money.

1:16:04.333 --> 1:16:05.208
It's alright I'll get it.

1:16:05.291 --> 1:16:07.375
Go down so long and get someone
to help me down the stairs.

1:16:07.458 --> 1:16:08.750
Hurry.

1:16:41.625 --> 1:16:43.500
Lost something?

1:16:55.041 --> 1:16:57.458
Going somewhere Pam?

1:16:58.500 --> 1:17:00.250
Emmie, just listen to...

1:17:07.375 --> 1:17:08.666
- Emmie...hear me out...

1:17:08.750 --> 1:17:10.041
- Emmie...hear me out...
- So...

1:17:10.500 --> 1:17:12.416
...where’s my money, hmm?

1:17:12.500 --> 1:17:13.791
We will get it for you, bra...

1:17:27.541 --> 1:17:29.000
Bastard!
- Where's my damn money?

1:17:29.083 --> 1:17:29.958
- Where's my damn money?
- We got it.

1:17:30.291 --> 1:17:31.375
We got it.

1:17:36.041 --> 1:17:37.041
So...

1:17:37.958 --> 1:17:39.166
...go get it.

1:17:44.375 --> 1:17:45.625
Our friend has it.

1:17:45.958 --> 1:17:47.166
We did a job.

1:17:49.250 --> 1:17:50.625
What kind of job was it Pam?

1:17:50.958 --> 1:17:52.875
Emmie, there's police everywhere.

1:17:52.958 --> 1:17:53.875
Just give us a chance please.

1:17:53.958 --> 1:17:54.791
Emmie.

1:17:54.875 --> 1:17:56.958
We were going to fetch
it earlier but then uhm...

1:17:57.958 --> 1:18:00.000
...but there was a shoot-out.
And we couldn't get it.

1:18:00.958 --> 1:18:02.375
We can get it tomorrow.

1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:04.333
Just one day.

1:18:05.791 --> 1:18:07.250
One day is all I'm asking for.

1:18:07.333 --> 1:18:09.458
Just one day. Just one day. Just one day.

1:18:11.583 --> 1:18:14.458
Please man, I'm begging you, please...

1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:21.000
Okay.

1:18:25.458 --> 1:18:26.458
Right.

1:18:30.583 --> 1:18:31.958
Until tomorrow then.

1:18:37.083 --> 1:18:38.458
But I...

1:18:39.250 --> 1:18:41.125
...need something in return.

1:18:44.666 --> 1:18:46.750
Call it interest if you will.

1:19:08.791 --> 1:19:10.125
Pam.

1:19:10.666 --> 1:19:12.000
Pam.

1:20:08.583 --> 1:20:10.291
What're we gonna do?

1:20:12.625 --> 1:20:14.625
I know you have no reason to trust me.

1:20:16.541 --> 1:20:18.500
But just give me one more chance.

1:20:19.833 --> 1:20:22.458
Just one more chance.
That's all I'm asking for.

1:20:36.375 --> 1:20:42.041
Every plan I've ever made has landed
us in deeper and deeper trouble.

1:20:44.166 --> 1:20:46.958
There was a time when
I could protect you.

1:20:48.250 --> 1:20:49.750
But not anymore.

1:20:51.666 --> 1:20:53.250
The police can't either.

1:21:10.250 --> 1:21:11.666
You can't go.

1:21:14.750 --> 1:21:16.750
Not in your wheelchair.

1:21:18.458 --> 1:21:20.291
We need help.

1:21:30.333 --> 1:21:32.166
Right. Now put the shank...

1:21:33.041 --> 1:21:35.333
...in the top of the hole like that. You see?

1:21:36.083 --> 1:21:39.458
Then you take this tool
and push it in the bottom.

1:21:42.458 --> 1:21:43.500
Like this?

1:22:02.791 --> 1:22:03.750
You see there?

1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:11.125
I can't do it.

1:22:18.458 --> 1:22:19.375
Again.

1:22:23.250 --> 1:22:24.458
You ready?

1:22:31.958 --> 1:22:32.958
Wait...

1:22:33.250 --> 1:22:34.750
I need to make it right.

1:22:35.250 --> 1:22:38.041
But first I have to get rid of Emmie.

1:22:46.791 --> 1:22:48.333
Detective February.

1:22:49.541 --> 1:22:51.416
It's Randal Hendricks.

1:22:51.500 --> 1:22:52.958
I'm ready to talk.

1:22:54.625 --> 1:22:56.250
Okay. Just hold on.

1:23:03.833 --> 1:23:05.291
Alright.

1:23:05.750 --> 1:23:08.500
I'm sure you know your
partner's dead Detective.

1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:11.958
I saw it with my binoculars.

1:23:13.500 --> 1:23:14.958
Your partner was dirty.

1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:17.333
Are you?

1:23:19.458 --> 1:23:21.166
I'm not my partner.

1:23:22.250 --> 1:23:24.041
I wish you were.

1:23:25.125 --> 1:23:28.041
You would've stood a better
chance at that police station.

1:23:29.041 --> 1:23:30.958
Warren...

1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:35.791
Warren and I decided to blackmail Lawyer.

1:23:41.458 --> 1:23:44.791
If I bring him in, will you testify?

1:23:45.125 --> 1:23:47.958
Yes but if they find out I said
something they'll kill my...

1:23:52.250 --> 1:23:55.833
Arrest me, Detective.
Use me, whatever.

1:23:57.750 --> 1:23:59.166
But my girlfriend...

1:24:00.125 --> 1:24:01.750
I give you my word.

1:24:02.666 --> 1:24:04.541
I'll protect you both.

1:24:12.958 --> 1:24:14.291
Who the hell is that?

1:24:14.375 --> 1:24:15.750
Go see who it is.

1:24:37.083 --> 1:24:38.750
I come in peace.

1:25:05.750 --> 1:25:08.250
I'll be watching you the whole time.

1:25:21.458 --> 1:25:22.875
Randal?

1:25:23.833 --> 1:25:25.250
Nothing happened.

1:25:26.458 --> 1:25:28.583
He made his move...

1:25:29.583 --> 1:25:31.291
...I told him he's an asshole.

1:25:32.375 --> 1:25:33.625
We laughed...

1:25:34.541 --> 1:25:36.083
...smoked...

1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:38.500
...then I cried and...

1:25:40.875 --> 1:25:42.833
...told him you're a bitch.

1:26:02.041 --> 1:26:03.500
I love you.

1:26:05.333 --> 1:26:06.875
You're full of crap...

1:26:10.625 --> 1:26:12.458
...but I love you.

1:27:13.291 --> 1:27:14.541
You there yet?

1:27:14.625 --> 1:27:15.958
Almost.

1:27:17.958 --> 1:27:19.583
Okay, I'm here.

1:27:19.666 --> 1:27:21.500
Number 37.

1:27:31.958 --> 1:27:34.250
Right, remember. Just like we practiced.

1:27:35.125 --> 1:27:36.833
Feel for the pins.

1:27:40.791 --> 1:27:41.958
Can you feel them?

1:27:42.041 --> 1:27:44.083
Yes, but the last one is stuck.

1:27:44.791 --> 1:27:47.708
Put more pressure on it.
Try to turn the shank.

1:27:47.791 --> 1:27:49.083
Hurry-up Pam.

1:27:49.166 --> 1:27:51.375
I know. Wait.

1:27:51.458 --> 1:27:52.625
Pam?

1:27:53.083 --> 1:27:54.250
Pam?

1:28:18.875 --> 1:28:20.250
Where are you?

1:28:29.666 --> 1:28:31.000
Shit.

1:28:34.250 --> 1:28:36.958
Shit Pam, is your phone on silent or not?

1:28:55.583 --> 1:28:59.375
Pam, Spook is there.
Run now. Now, now, now. Run.

1:28:59.458 --> 1:29:01.541
Hide Pam. Now!

1:29:07.833 --> 1:29:08.750
Pam?

1:29:09.541 --> 1:29:10.541
Pam?!

1:29:28.458 --> 1:29:31.083
Let's talk about Detective Meyer.

1:29:34.125 --> 1:29:37.375
I admire your commitment to the law lady.

1:29:37.458 --> 1:29:39.458
But let me tell you something.
On the Cape Flats...

1:29:39.541 --> 1:29:41.250
...it's misplaced.

1:29:41.750 --> 1:29:45.250
Where were you yesterday
between 7am and 2pm?

1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:47.458
I was sleeping.

1:29:48.625 --> 1:29:50.666
And yesterday during the shooting?

1:29:50.958 --> 1:29:52.458
Shooting?

1:29:53.041 --> 1:29:55.125
People shoot the whole
day on the Cape Flats.

1:29:55.375 --> 1:29:56.500
Detective.

1:29:56.750 --> 1:29:58.041
A word please.

1:30:08.375 --> 1:30:12.250
Can someone take these damn things off me.

1:30:22.041 --> 1:30:24.375
They're fighting about something.

1:30:25.625 --> 1:30:26.458
Shit.

1:30:26.541 --> 1:30:27.416
What?

1:30:27.500 --> 1:30:29.250
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

1:30:29.333 --> 1:30:30.666
What's going on?

1:30:30.750 --> 1:30:31.833
I can't hear anything.

1:30:33.125 --> 1:30:35.083
Pam, he's coming to the room.

1:31:11.666 --> 1:31:14.083
He's back in the lounge.

1:31:43.625 --> 1:31:44.958
What's going on? What is it?

1:31:47.958 --> 1:31:50.458
No. Stay there. Just stay there.

1:32:01.958 --> 1:32:03.250
Release him.

1:32:48.333 --> 1:32:49.916
Don't even think about it.

1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:51.750
Relax.

1:32:56.875 --> 1:32:58.333
On the table.

1:33:02.583 --> 1:33:04.541
Ever shot a man before?

1:33:10.583 --> 1:33:12.083
I don't think so.

1:33:34.750 --> 1:33:36.250
Stupid bitch!

1:34:07.791 --> 1:34:10.083
Jeez girl.

1:34:58.958 --> 1:35:00.458
No, please!

1:35:43.500 --> 1:35:45.250
What did I tell you...

1:35:45.750 --> 1:35:48.166
...about greedy little pigs?

1:35:48.250 --> 1:35:49.458
Randal!

1:35:49.541 --> 1:35:51.375
No, stop it!

1:35:51.625 --> 1:35:52.666
Let her go.

1:35:52.750 --> 1:35:54.416
Please! Leave her alone.

1:35:54.500 --> 1:35:57.000
I'm begging you. Please.

1:35:57.583 --> 1:35:59.166
Please just let her go!

1:35:59.250 --> 1:36:01.375
Bye Randal.

1:36:01.458 --> 1:36:03.333
Randal!

1:36:19.666 --> 1:36:22.291
Answer the bloody phone, Randal.

1:37:03.333 --> 1:37:04.541
Mrs. Raymond.

1:37:54.250 --> 1:37:55.375
Emmie!

1:37:57.291 --> 1:37:58.875
The door's open!

1:38:24.291 --> 1:38:25.875
Randal?

1:38:26.875 --> 1:38:28.250
Pam?

1:38:40.458 --> 1:38:43.958
Yes you, you're gonna learn.

1:38:53.958 --> 1:38:55.458
They ran.

1:38:56.250 --> 1:38:57.750
The assholes.

1:39:17.750 --> 1:39:18.958
Pam?

1:39:19.041 --> 1:39:20.750
Where are you?

1:39:22.375 --> 1:39:24.250
Pam, can't talk right now...

1:39:26.083 --> 1:39:27.458
...Randal.

1:39:27.666 --> 1:39:29.375
This isn't Randal.

1:39:29.750 --> 1:39:31.000
Are you sure?

1:39:31.875 --> 1:39:33.875
After you worked so
hard to get your money.

1:39:33.958 --> 1:39:35.750
I've got it right here.

1:39:38.666 --> 1:39:40.500
So you're the rubbish with my money.

1:39:42.583 --> 1:39:45.791
Bring it here. I'm waiting for you.

1:39:51.250 --> 1:39:52.958
The motherfucker.

1:39:53.541 --> 1:39:54.791
He doesn't know
who he's dealing with.

1:39:57.250 --> 1:39:59.625
Hey bra. Lawyer, check this out.

1:40:00.166 --> 1:40:03.041
I told you it's a bunch
of nutcases in this block.

1:40:13.750 --> 1:40:15.125
Tell me...

1:40:15.458 --> 1:40:17.541
...in which one of these apartments...

1:40:18.458 --> 1:40:19.833
...does Randal stay?

1:40:29.166 --> 1:40:30.750
He stays down there.

1:40:32.166 --> 1:40:33.583
There where the door is open.

1:40:52.833 --> 1:40:55.458
Help the poor man into his wheelchair.

1:40:55.750 --> 1:40:57.458
Seriously?

1:41:04.458 --> 1:41:06.291
Now I must do this crap.

1:41:12.625 --> 1:41:14.000
Then you're still heavy also.

1:41:14.625 --> 1:41:15.791
You must learn to walk now.

1:41:25.500 --> 1:41:26.916
What kind of man...

1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:28.291
...sends his woman...

1:41:28.375 --> 1:41:30.083
...to do his dirty work?

1:41:38.625 --> 1:41:39.875
Where's Pam?

1:41:39.958 --> 1:41:40.875
Pam?

1:41:40.958 --> 1:41:43.041
She's a bit tied up at the moment.

1:41:46.791 --> 1:41:48.083
Is that for me?

1:41:49.083 --> 1:41:50.083
A little present.

1:41:50.166 --> 1:41:52.541
An example of what happens to people...

1:41:53.291 --> 1:41:55.000
...that think they can steal from me.

1:42:00.666 --> 1:42:02.291
Hey you.

1:42:02.375 --> 1:42:04.125
Relax.

1:42:10.083 --> 1:42:11.500
Gentlemen...

1:42:13.083 --> 1:42:14.750
...put the guns down.

1:42:15.750 --> 1:42:17.125
Just give me the money.

1:42:17.375 --> 1:42:19.166
Why don't you go ask Pam...

1:42:19.458 --> 1:42:21.000
...what happens to pigs...

1:42:21.083 --> 1:42:22.375
...that think they can steal from me.

1:42:22.458 --> 1:42:23.375
Hey!

1:42:23.458 --> 1:42:25.958
They stole from me.

1:42:26.291 --> 1:42:28.250
I just want what's mine.

1:42:29.291 --> 1:42:30.291
If you say so.

1:42:30.750 --> 1:42:32.833
If you, say so.

1:42:57.875 --> 1:43:00.666
<i>10-35. Gun shots reported
in Haven Mansions.</i>

1:43:00.750 --> 1:43:04.625
<i>All units requested to respond.
Be extremely careful.</i>

1:43:05.625 --> 1:43:08.125
<i>B-23. 10-4. On route.</i>

1:43:12.375 --> 1:43:14.000
<i>A-24. 10-20.</i>

1:43:16.250 --> 1:43:17.750
C'mon Randal.

1:43:19.041 --> 1:43:21.166
C'mon answer the phone.

1:44:20.666 --> 1:44:22.125
Mother...

1:44:22.833 --> 1:44:24.000
...fucker.

1:45:09.958 --> 1:45:12.833
So Lieutenant-Colonel,
what do you make of this?

1:45:18.041 --> 1:45:19.958
I had him in custody.

1:45:26.250 --> 1:45:28.458
We know who they are,
but who are these two?

1:45:32.250 --> 1:45:33.791
The people who live here,
the ones in the photos...

1:45:35.666 --> 1:45:37.166
...they must know something.

1:45:37.250 --> 1:45:39.458
We need to find them.

1:45:48.875 --> 1:45:51.333
Lieutenant I asked you a question.

1:45:53.041 --> 1:45:54.833
Hey! I'm talking to you.

1:45:57.750 --> 1:46:00.166
The people who live here.
We need to find them.

1:46:00.250 --> 1:46:01.750
Do you know who they are?

1:46:11.750 --> 1:46:12.583
No sir.

1:47:11.750 --> 1:47:12.958
I'm okay.

1:47:14.458 --> 1:47:15.583
I'm okay.

1:47:16.375 --> 1:47:18.083
Pam.
