00:00.917 --> 00:02.585
Previously on Prison Break:

00:02.669 --> 00:03.628
When were you planning on

00:03.712 --> 00:06.798
telling me that your mother
was behind all this?

00:06.881 --> 00:09.175
You have today, one day.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.720
When Burrows brings
Scylla back to us,

00:11.803 --> 00:13.388
you will be the one

00:13.471 --> 00:15.515
to put a bullet
in his brain.

00:15.598 --> 00:17.350
Naveen Banerjee,

00:17.434 --> 00:20.437
the son of Prime Minister
Nandu Banerjee.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.773
Soon, this will all be behind us,

00:23.857 --> 00:25.483
and maybe I can
meet my grandson.

00:25.567 --> 00:26.860
Where's Linc?!

00:26.943 --> 00:28.361
There's an energy conference

00:28.445 --> 00:30.363
at the Panda Bay Hotel.
He'll be there.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.990
Christina's plan...
what she needed

00:32.073 --> 00:34.034
to profit from Scylla.
An incident

00:34.117 --> 00:36.286
that'll domino
into global warfare.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.413
No!

00:42.834 --> 00:44.044
They rented this in Linc's name.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.462
Look at this.
It's a setup!

00:46.004 --> 00:47.964
His hands are
all over the shells.

00:48.923 --> 00:50.717
Lincoln's right back where he started.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.385
It really is too bad
about Michael.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.512
We gotta go. Come on.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.976
I need a doctor here!

01:03.772 --> 01:05.690
I need a doctor!

01:07.108 --> 01:09.152
Somebody call 911!
There they are!

01:09.235 --> 01:11.154
They're up there!
They're up there!

01:11.237 --> 01:12.781
Everybody upstairs now!

01:12.864 --> 01:14.449
Move it! Move it!

01:15.992 --> 01:17.994
Look, let's just blend
into the crowd.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.621
No, we can't go that way.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.456
The door is locked, Michael.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.458
Stand back.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.177
Let's go! Let's go!

01:34.260 --> 01:36.387
Get those people back!

01:47.816 --> 01:49.192
Clear!

01:55.573 --> 01:56.825
Down here! Move!

02:03.039 --> 02:05.416
This whole thing
is falling apart.

02:06.626 --> 02:07.669
Is it?

02:07.752 --> 02:08.753
Is it really?

02:08.837 --> 02:09.921
What, do you think
this is funny? Huh?

02:10.004 --> 02:11.005
How long you think
it's gonna take

02:11.089 --> 02:13.049
before the General
sees this on the news?

02:13.133 --> 02:14.425
If he thinks we
can't get Scylla,

02:14.509 --> 02:15.593
how long do you think
it's gonna take

02:15.677 --> 02:16.761
before he comes after us?

02:16.845 --> 02:17.887
And then he comes
after our families?

02:17.971 --> 02:19.389
Yeah, it's really
funny, isn't it?

02:45.707 --> 02:47.125
Michael, where are you?

02:47.208 --> 02:48.126
We're still in the hotel.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.210
Is there any other way

02:49.294 --> 02:50.753
to get out of here
without being seen?

02:50.837 --> 02:52.755
No, there's cops and feds
all over the place.

02:52.839 --> 02:53.756
Did you get Scylla?

02:53.882 --> 02:54.883
No.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.551
Some guy got assassinated.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.344
And guess who got
set up for it.

03:00.513 --> 03:01.514
We need Scylla.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.891
Scylla is gone!

03:03.016 --> 03:04.517
The only thing I care
about right now

03:04.601 --> 03:05.518
is getting out of here.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.020
Oh, yeah? Where you gonna
go, Michael, huh?

03:07.103 --> 03:08.271
With the Company breathing down

03:08.354 --> 03:09.355
our back again?

03:11.274 --> 03:12.734
Scofield, it's Don.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.444
What do you want?

03:14.569 --> 03:15.778
To try to fix this.

03:15.862 --> 03:16.779
How?

03:16.863 --> 03:18.198
By stabbing us
in the back again?

03:18.281 --> 03:19.741
Put Alex on.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.284
He's a little preoccupied
right now.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.411
Look, you want to
be mad at me, be mad

03:23.494 --> 03:24.579
at me after we
get Scylla back.

03:24.662 --> 03:25.747
Now listen to me.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.373
Okay, the southwest
loading dock is a

03:27.457 --> 03:28.791
large industrial door.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.418
It's not conducive
to a quick exit.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.212
They only have
one cop on it.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.631
When you get to the door,
I can incapacitate the cop.

03:34.714 --> 03:35.673
Problem is, we're
on the other side

03:35.757 --> 03:36.758
of the hotel, and they've got

03:36.841 --> 03:38.092
the ground floor covered.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.969
What else can you
see on the outside?

03:40.637 --> 03:41.971
Nothing, just the cop,

03:42.055 --> 03:44.349
a couple of Dumpsters, jack
pallets and some laundry bins.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.517
That must mean
the on-site laundry's

03:46.601 --> 03:47.727
on the other side of the hotel,

03:47.810 --> 03:49.229
near the loading dock door.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.940
If we get to the laundry,
we can get to the door.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.358
You said we can't make it
across the hotel.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.902
But we can get access
to the roof.

03:55.985 --> 03:58.571
Hotels use rooftop ventilation,

03:58.655 --> 04:00.448
so the hotel guests don't
smell the laundry fumes.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.286
Okay, so, listen, take
the ventilation system

04:05.370 --> 04:07.497
to the laundry room. If you
can get to the laundry room,

04:07.580 --> 04:09.290
you're gonna get
right by the door.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.252
Put me on speaker.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.379
Alex, you want to get

04:14.462 --> 04:15.672
The Company off our backs?

04:15.755 --> 04:17.548
Go to 4 Dunn Place.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.300
Sara's holding
my mother there.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.511
Make her tell us
where Scylla is.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.137
And clear our
names in all this.

04:24.555 --> 04:28.476
Mahone, you need to do whatever
you gotta do to get her to talk,

04:28.559 --> 04:29.644
you hear me?

04:29.727 --> 04:31.521
Do whatever you gotta do.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.689
Got it.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.067
Come on.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.392
It is complete mayhem
at the Panda Bay Hotel

05:09.475 --> 05:10.727
where Naveen Banerjee,

05:10.810 --> 05:11.728
the son of India's
Prime Minister,

05:11.811 --> 05:13.021
has been assassinated.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.148
Amazingly, there have
been unconfirmed reports

05:15.231 --> 05:17.567
identifying the assailants
as none other than

05:17.650 --> 05:19.694
Lincoln Burrows, the man
who'd been suspected

05:19.777 --> 05:20.987
of murdering Terrence Steadman,

05:21.070 --> 05:22.405
and Michael Scofield,
his mastermind brother...

05:22.488 --> 05:24.574
Christina sandbagged all of us!

05:24.657 --> 05:27.285
It is believed they are still
in the building...

05:27.368 --> 05:28.828
If the brothers are caught,

05:28.911 --> 05:30.288
we have no control over what

05:30.371 --> 05:32.457
they might say
to the authorities.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.750
Get down to that hotel

05:33.833 --> 05:35.752
and make sure they don't
have that opportunity.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.587
Uh, General, I'd be
more than willing

05:37.670 --> 05:39.088
to take on that assignment.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.549
And I assure you I will
dispatch of it efficiently.

05:41.632 --> 05:44.594
This is not an Alabama
coon hunt, Teddy.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.262
Don't judge me
by the desperate actions

05:46.346 --> 05:47.930
I've taken when there's
been a gun to my head.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.016
I ran an entire
prison gang syndicate.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.851
Hardened felons
called me "Mister."

05:52.810 --> 05:54.312
I'm so much more
than a snitch.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.980
And if you continue
to treat me as such,

05:56.064 --> 05:58.566
it will be your loss,
General, not mine.

05:58.649 --> 06:01.235
Son, I have the fate

06:01.319 --> 06:04.864
of a multi-trillion dollar
enterprise in my hands,

06:04.947 --> 06:07.950
and you want me to let
you earn your stripes

06:08.034 --> 06:09.160
now?!

06:12.205 --> 06:14.290
Take care of the brothers.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.132
Here we go!
Here we go!

06:24.509 --> 06:25.885
This should be it.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.141
Perfect.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.562
SARs should
be here shortly.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.231
I want you guys on full alert

06:38.314 --> 06:39.982
and get all geared up,
all right?

06:40.066 --> 06:41.150
It's them!

06:41.234 --> 06:42.485
Stop!

07:02.672 --> 07:04.173
They could be on any floor.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.717
Can you override
the door locks?

07:06.801 --> 07:07.844
Yeah, they're electronic.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.053
We control everything
from down here.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.848
I want every room in this
hotel locked down now!

07:16.769 --> 07:18.688
Why don't we just take
the stairs to the roof?

07:18.771 --> 07:20.273
Because we'll set off
the fire alarm.

07:20.356 --> 07:23.484
The ducts in the crawl spaces
above these top floor rooms,

07:23.568 --> 07:25.862
that's how we get
our rooftop access.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.905
Once we find the laundry vent,

07:27.989 --> 07:30.283
we take that down
to the loading dock.

07:38.374 --> 07:39.709
That should do it.

07:54.807 --> 07:57.351
Go! Go!

08:05.109 --> 08:06.527
What's going on?

08:07.528 --> 08:09.197
They locked us out.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.406
We can't get to the roof.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.574
Let's head back down.

08:11.657 --> 08:12.742
There'll be cops
in the stairwell.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.535
We can't go up.
We can't go down...

08:16.120 --> 08:17.079
We're trapped.

08:23.669 --> 08:24.712
There has been a new development

08:24.795 --> 08:26.297
in the Panda Bay assassination.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.423
An anonymous source
has provided FOX

08:27.507 --> 08:30.718
with documents
showing a wire transfer

08:30.801 --> 08:34.096
from Chinese operatives
to Burrows and Scofield.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.474
The fallout from this
from a geopolitical standpoint

08:36.557 --> 08:37.683
is staggering.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.143
Relations between
China and India...

08:39.644 --> 08:40.937
Nandu reached out.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.482
He wants to meet with you.

08:44.565 --> 08:45.942
This couldn't have
worked out better.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.402
Nice audible on the
Chinese document.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.820
Thank you.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.491
Now we just...

08:53.574 --> 08:55.201
watch the dominoes
begin to fall.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.622
I just wish they weren't
falling on Michael.

09:00.748 --> 09:03.000
Christina, you gave him options.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.253
He made his choice.
He picked his side.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.090
Yes, but he is my son.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.388
My only son.

09:15.471 --> 09:16.764
And right now it is believed

09:16.847 --> 09:18.224
both Burrows and Scofield

09:18.307 --> 09:19.809
are still in the hotel,

09:19.892 --> 09:22.478
but it appears
the police are closing in.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.565
Live just outside
the Panda Bay Hotel...

09:27.900 --> 09:30.027
No, no, no, you see,
that's the problem, Michael.

09:30.111 --> 09:31.112
There's cops everywhere.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.780
It's like a freaking
cop anthill out here.

09:32.863 --> 09:35.825
Look, it's just a matter of time
till they find you anyway.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.160
Find out what their
plan of attack is.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.412
Sure, you know what?

09:39.495 --> 09:40.496
Yeah, I'll just go up

09:40.580 --> 09:41.998
and ask them, all right?

09:42.081 --> 09:43.624
They look like
a real friendly bunch.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.918
We don't have much time,
so get it done now!

09:49.422 --> 09:51.507
Burrows and Scofield
could be armed to the teeth.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.758
It's tight quarters
in the stairwell,

09:52.842 --> 09:54.010
so I don't want a lot
of shooting, all right?

09:54.093 --> 09:55.344
This guy's from
Homeland Security.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.971
I'll file my report
as soon as

09:57.054 --> 09:58.556
I've apprehended
the shooters.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.057
Whoa, whoa, let me
be clear here, Captain.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.226
The shooting that
happened today

10:02.310 --> 10:03.561
wasn't your typical gangbanger,

10:03.644 --> 10:05.730
public service killing
you're used to here in Miami.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.899
This was an international
assassination with ramifications

10:08.983 --> 10:11.110
that directly affect
the security of this country.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.112
So, if you turn
your back on me again,

10:13.279 --> 10:15.281
I'll jam you up for hindering
a federal investigation.

10:15.364 --> 10:16.657
You understand?

10:19.410 --> 10:20.578
Fine.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.038
But I want you on my hip.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.290
I'm not gonna have you running
around playing weekend warrior

10:24.457 --> 10:26.125
so you can go back
to your buddies at the office

10:26.208 --> 10:28.127
and tell them you saw some
real gunplay, understood?

10:28.210 --> 10:29.253
Not a problem.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.755
Now, why don't you
start by telling me

10:30.838 --> 10:32.506
how you're gonna
defuse the situation?

10:32.673 --> 10:34.717
We're gonna gas them out floor
by floor until we find them.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.011
Whoa, hold on there, Tex.
If you use gas you're gonna

10:37.178 --> 10:39.055
compromise visibility,
and I can't afford

10:39.138 --> 10:41.182
another diplomat
getting shot in the fez.

10:41.265 --> 10:43.017
We're using chloropropane.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.560
It's colorless. It's odorless.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.479
They won't even know
what hit them.

10:48.272 --> 10:49.440
All right, listen up.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.525
I want two men in the east
stairwell with the gas,

10:51.609 --> 10:53.027
two at the base
of the west stairwell

10:53.110 --> 10:54.320
in case they try to
come back down again.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.489
I'll have backup detail
ready, all right?

10:56.614 --> 10:58.324
Let's go! Move! Move!

11:25.768 --> 11:27.311
Sara?

11:31.148 --> 11:32.316
Oh, my God.

11:32.441 --> 11:33.442
Sara.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.571
You hurt? You okay?

11:38.155 --> 11:39.490
I'm fine. Christina's gone.

11:39.573 --> 11:41.033
There's a knife
in the last drawer.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.202
Do you have any idea
where she went?

11:43.494 --> 11:44.537
No.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.667
She has Scylla.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.212
She set up Linc
and Michael.

11:53.295 --> 11:54.672
She could be
anywhere.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.048
Michael and Lincoln?

11:56.132 --> 11:58.300
Yeah, they were framed for the
murder of an Indian official.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.760
It's all over the news.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.345
That was Christina's plan,
and...

12:01.679 --> 12:02.680
Where are they now?

12:02.930 --> 12:05.141
They're trapped
at the Panda Bay Hotel.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.809
The police are looking
for them.

12:06.976 --> 12:07.893
Okay.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.354
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
You can't go there.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.189
The cops are everywhere.
I really need you to get out of my way.

12:12.314 --> 12:13.691
Well, that's not
gonna happen.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.945
You don't care for me,
I don't care for you

12:18.028 --> 12:21.991
much either,
but I owe Michael, okay? Run.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.242
He's in a sea
of trouble right now.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.744
I'm not abandoning him.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.079
I'm not telling you to abandon him.
There's nothing you can do for him.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.831
Listen, I'd run
if I could run.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.708
But if I run,
they go after my wife,

12:30.833 --> 12:32.376
so I have to jump back in.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.461
You don't.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.045
I'm not running.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.886
I'll stay here, okay?

12:42.261 --> 12:44.180
That way, Michael
knows where I am.

12:45.848 --> 12:46.932
So does Christina.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.435
If she wanted me dead,
I would be already.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.270
Suit yourself.

12:51.562 --> 12:52.646
Alex?

12:57.860 --> 12:58.819
Thanks.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.572
And if you see Michael,
tell him I'm here.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.032
Yeah.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.829
I know how difficult
this must be for you.

13:08.913 --> 13:12.041
Mr. Prime Minister,
I, too, lost a son

13:12.124 --> 13:13.959
when he was just a child.

13:15.044 --> 13:18.172
Was your son murdered
by an assailant's bullet?

13:18.255 --> 13:19.673
Of course not.

13:21.675 --> 13:25.930
I've heard the news that
the Chinese are behind this.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.475
Yes, I've heard
that as well.

13:29.558 --> 13:30.810
And that's why
I'm here.

13:30.893 --> 13:34.855
Not to discuss how my son died,
but how to avenge him.

13:35.648 --> 13:39.026
Your technology,
as you put it...

13:39.109 --> 13:43.197
I've heard rumors
of its varied applications.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.490
Nandu, let's take
a breath here.

13:44.573 --> 13:51.497
No! The time to take a breath
expired when my son died.

13:51.580 --> 13:54.291
Your son and I had planned
to use the technology

13:54.375 --> 13:56.460
for humanitarian endeavors.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.462
Warfare applications

13:58.546 --> 13:59.630
were not our goal.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.341
But now they are mine,
and at the end of the day,

14:02.424 --> 14:04.051
you're a businesswoman
with a product

14:04.134 --> 14:05.219
and I am a buyer.

14:05.302 --> 14:06.512
I want to commit

14:06.595 --> 14:09.348
to all the intellectual property
you possess.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.350
I want the People's
Republic of China

14:11.433 --> 14:14.562
to feel the pain I feel
right now!

14:16.146 --> 14:20.568
Do you comprehend
the ramifications

14:20.651 --> 14:22.736
of what it is you're proposing?

14:25.406 --> 14:26.866
More than you know.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.791
If it is what you want.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.795
I must go now...

14:41.088 --> 14:44.884
to make arrangements
for your payment, and arrangements

14:44.967 --> 14:47.595
for my child's burial.

15:18.751 --> 15:19.793
Yeah?

15:19.877 --> 15:21.587
Congratulations.
You're famous again.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.172
You're all over the news
for killing Gandhi.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.215
I figured as much.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.134
Yeah, well, it gets worse.

15:27.217 --> 15:28.594
They're gonna gas you out.

15:28.677 --> 15:29.762
When?

15:29.845 --> 15:31.138
They already started.
They're going floor-by-floor.

15:31.221 --> 15:33.140
They're about at the third
or fourth floor right now.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.434
Why are you just
telling me about this now?

15:35.517 --> 15:36.560
I had to leave the lobby.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.062
I can't make anybody
more suspicious.

15:43.192 --> 15:46.362
Hello, Michael? Michael?

15:48.155 --> 15:49.698
Linc, I need
your help.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.077
When I was in fourth grade,

15:53.160 --> 15:56.622
I... I got an A for guessing
all the answers on this test.

15:56.705 --> 15:58.666
I never thought
I'd beat those odds.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.963
What kind of loser
gets set up

16:04.046 --> 16:08.425
for two high-profile assassinations
within five years?

16:08.509 --> 16:09.802
Lincoln, this is
not your fault.

16:09.885 --> 16:11.512
If they didn't get
away with it then,

16:11.595 --> 16:13.222
they're not gonna
get away with it now.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.974
But I need you to focus.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.060
I need your help, Linc.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.651
Right. Let's
get out of here.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.618
Darrin Hooks,
Homeland Security.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.787
Can you point me
to whoever's in charge here?

16:36.870 --> 16:39.581
Homeland? How many of you guys
are they sending here?

16:39.665 --> 16:41.458
Agent Self's already inside.

16:41.875 --> 16:42.751
Who?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.128
Agent Don Self.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.754
Got here a little
while ago.

16:52.928 --> 16:53.971
Yeah, it's Hooks.

16:54.972 --> 16:55.848
The name of that agent

16:55.931 --> 16:59.018
that was supposedly killed
recently in L.A.?

16:59.101 --> 17:01.437
Was his name Don Self?

17:07.109 --> 17:11.655
It's all falling out
exactly as Christina planned it.

17:11.739 --> 17:16.326
Now she's going to have
everything she ever hoped for.

17:16.410 --> 17:20.831
She's trying to reignite
the 1962 China-India Border War

17:20.914 --> 17:22.374
which ended in an uneasy truce

17:22.458 --> 17:24.835
when neither country
could withstand the losses

17:24.918 --> 17:28.547
they were sustaining in those
remote and desolate mountains.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.383
If she succeeds
in provoking another war,

17:32.509 --> 17:33.761
and framing China

17:33.844 --> 17:36.430
for the killing of India's
Prime Minister's son,

17:36.513 --> 17:37.556
is certainly
provocation enough.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.933
She'll set off
a military conflict

17:40.017 --> 17:42.352
that will last for decades

17:42.436 --> 17:44.229
that may never
be resolved.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.898
Why didn't you do it
yourself?

17:47.232 --> 17:50.903
Power, money... seem
to be things you love.

17:50.986 --> 17:54.323
Because if India's involved,
that drags in Pakistan.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.325
Then Russia's gonna want
to defend its borders.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.577
Then within a year,
Europe's in it

17:58.660 --> 17:59.953
and after that,
the United States.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.040
It's an apocalypse
in which everyone loses!

18:03.123 --> 18:06.418
And Christina has always
been too prideful

18:06.502 --> 18:09.379
and too unstable
to accept that.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.200
Got it.

18:44.706 --> 18:45.958
Can I help you?

18:46.625 --> 18:50.504
Hi. Yes, I think you can.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.347
Agent Self.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.563
Donald Self?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.821
Agent Darrin Hooks.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.497
It's good to see you.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.291
It's good to see you, too.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.927
Hold it. Hold it right there.
Don't move.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.764
What the hell are you doing,
Hooks?

19:42.848 --> 19:44.516
You always pull guns
on fellow agents?

19:44.600 --> 19:47.895
Yeah, when agents
that are supposedly dead

19:47.978 --> 19:50.856
and are found later in a hotel
with the guys that killed him.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.400
You mind telling me
what you're doing here

19:53.483 --> 19:54.401
with Burrows and Scofield?

19:54.484 --> 19:55.694
My cover called for me

19:55.777 --> 19:56.778
to be dead, okay?

19:56.862 --> 19:58.906
People were catching on
to what we were doing,

19:58.989 --> 20:00.365
and my death freed me up.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.327
But Burrows and Scofield
have been set up, okay?

20:03.410 --> 20:05.787
There's no record of you
in covert ops.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.039
That was by design.

20:07.122 --> 20:09.458
Look, when this is all over,
we'll call the home office,

20:09.541 --> 20:10.626
I'll punch in my
clearance code,

20:10.709 --> 20:11.877
you can buy me
a couple of drinks,

20:11.960 --> 20:13.587
and we'll share
some laughs about this.

20:13.670 --> 20:16.715
But right now I need
to do my damn job.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.634
No.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.928
You're gonna follow
and we're gonna

20:21.011 --> 20:22.554
clear this up right now.

20:25.182 --> 20:29.353
Okay, but what I said about
Scofield and Burrows is true.

20:29.436 --> 20:30.520
They've been set up.

20:30.604 --> 20:31.563
You need to look into this.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.523
Oh, I'm gonna look
into everything

20:33.607 --> 20:35.108
as soon
as we get outside.

20:35.192 --> 20:36.193
Let's go.

21:43.218 --> 21:44.678
Did you clear
the loading dock doors?

21:45.345 --> 21:47.514
No, but someone else did.

21:47.597 --> 21:48.682
What do you mean?

21:48.765 --> 21:50.100
Someone must've taken him out.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.019
Which means there's someone
in the hotel

21:52.102 --> 21:53.478
other than the police
that's looking for you.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.065
Linc,
we got to move.

21:57.441 --> 21:58.942
Got more than just
the cops after us now.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.111
Whoa, whoa. You know what
you're doing?

22:01.653 --> 22:02.738
No.

22:08.869 --> 22:09.870
Let's go.

22:11.538 --> 22:14.249
I want everybody with full gear on.

22:14.499 --> 22:15.709
Captain Hutchinson!

22:15.834 --> 22:17.002
We've got a room breach

22:17.085 --> 22:18.086
on Sixteen.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.713
This is Hutchinson.

22:19.796 --> 22:21.214
Scofield and Burrows
are on Sixteen.

22:21.381 --> 22:23.633
I repeat: Scofield and Burrows
are on Sixteen.

22:24.634 --> 22:25.594
Go, go, go!

22:25.677 --> 22:27.137
Move, move, move!

22:34.227 --> 22:35.479
This way.

22:41.651 --> 22:42.986
Make sure the
door can shut.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.279
We need the
pressure to build.

22:59.002 --> 23:01.296
They're coming.
They're coming!

23:16.311 --> 23:17.771
We're on Sixteen.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.272
Copy that.

23:19.356 --> 23:20.941
On my mark.

23:22.150 --> 23:23.485
Go.

24:03.817 --> 24:04.860
Backup detail!

24:04.943 --> 24:06.570
Move! Go,
go, go, go!

24:07.821 --> 24:09.573
Move, move, move!
Go! Move!

24:09.656 --> 24:11.324
Move, move!

24:12.242 --> 24:13.785
What the hell happened?

24:13.869 --> 24:15.162
They booby-trapped us.

24:15.245 --> 24:16.371
They made a move
for the roof.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.248
All right,
get them to a hospital.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.250
All right. Let's go!
Move, move, move!

24:38.143 --> 24:39.561
Stop right there!

24:40.604 --> 24:42.731
Don't make a move
for that weapon, Burrows.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.485
Take the masks off.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.070
Take them off now!

24:52.324 --> 24:54.075
Hands behind
your head.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.079
You'd better pray to God that
my men are found out all right.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.623
It was a concussive blast.

24:59.706 --> 25:00.832
They're just unconscious.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.459
Shut up.

25:04.419 --> 25:05.504
Easy!

25:06.463 --> 25:08.548
Easy.

25:08.632 --> 25:12.302
And I'd follow that advice
about not going for your guns.

25:12.385 --> 25:15.347
The General would like you back
at the loft.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.100
Now.

25:37.118 --> 25:39.538
Did all go well at the hotel?

25:41.206 --> 25:43.124
What's going on with Sara and my mother?

25:43.208 --> 25:44.543
Christina escaped.

25:45.168 --> 25:46.461
Sara's okay.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.171
She's in the condo.

25:48.255 --> 25:50.799
Excuse me, would you boys like
a little alone time

25:50.882 --> 25:52.008
to catch up?

25:52.092 --> 25:53.927
What exactly do you
expect from us?

25:54.010 --> 25:55.762
You need to take
responsibility

25:55.845 --> 25:56.930
for your failures.

25:57.013 --> 25:58.181
Hey, we failed nothing.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.058
This whole thing
was a setup.

26:00.141 --> 26:01.101
You know it.

26:01.184 --> 26:02.686
Lincoln Burrows
was outsmarted.

26:03.895 --> 26:05.397
Who could have anticipated that?

26:11.319 --> 26:13.655
I think you need to accept
that this is over.

26:17.117 --> 26:20.370
I've been holding a chip
for far too long.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.164
It's time to play it.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.460
I made you boys a promise.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.170
You would find Scylla

26:29.254 --> 26:32.507
and I would see to it
you got some cash

26:33.300 --> 26:34.926
and had the slate wiped clean.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.387
I intend to keep
that promise.

26:37.470 --> 26:38.805
However, if I keep

26:38.888 --> 26:40.682
one promise,

26:40.765 --> 26:42.309
I have to keep them all.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.061
Now...

26:45.895 --> 26:46.771
I wonder

26:46.855 --> 26:49.316
who the big winner will be.

26:50.567 --> 26:51.526
Don't do this.

26:51.610 --> 26:52.819
Don't do what?

26:52.902 --> 26:56.156
When I sent you those envelopes,
I wasn't just playing games.

26:56.239 --> 26:58.700
I made it very clear

26:58.783 --> 26:59.993
that you
had one day

27:00.076 --> 27:01.828
to accomplish your job,

27:01.911 --> 27:03.496
or there would be

27:03.580 --> 27:04.456
consequences.

27:04.539 --> 27:05.540
What's that?

27:05.624 --> 27:07.167
The consequence.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.502
Call our man in Queens.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.172
Queens? What are you calling
New York for?

27:12.255 --> 27:13.673
Put it on speaker,
please.

27:15.258 --> 27:16.843
Yes.

27:16.926 --> 27:18.511
Move on subject four.

27:18.595 --> 27:19.721
I'm a block away.

27:19.804 --> 27:21.514
ETA is less than
two minutes.

27:22.515 --> 27:23.892
You son of a bitch.

27:23.975 --> 27:25.060
You son of a bitch!

27:25.143 --> 27:26.770
My wife is a
defenseless woman.

27:26.853 --> 27:30.065
Mr. Self didn't inform you
that he had a wife, did he?

27:30.148 --> 27:31.358
Well, I wouldn't talk

27:31.441 --> 27:33.151
about my wife either
if I'd had a few too many

27:33.234 --> 27:34.944
bourbons, got behind the wheel,

27:35.028 --> 27:36.988
and turned
a beautiful young woman

27:37.072 --> 27:39.199
into a piece of broccoli.

27:39.282 --> 27:40.325
Don't do anything.

27:40.408 --> 27:41.993
I assume that is
why you tried

27:42.077 --> 27:44.037
to run away with Scylla?

27:44.120 --> 27:45.288
To screw
a government

27:45.372 --> 27:46.873
that was giving you benefits
that would only pay

27:46.956 --> 27:49.084
for a county
facility overlooking

27:49.167 --> 27:52.087
the Belt Parkway,
and to sell it

27:52.170 --> 27:54.756
so that you and she
could disappear

27:54.839 --> 27:57.133
and be hidden forever.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.096
I have the subject in sights.

28:01.179 --> 28:02.180
She's in a wheelchair

28:02.263 --> 28:03.890
under a tree
in the hospital courtyard.

28:03.973 --> 28:04.891
Do I have a go?

28:04.974 --> 28:06.518
Please don't do this.

28:06.601 --> 28:07.435
Okay, please,

28:07.519 --> 28:09.062
you can kill me,
okay, you can kill me

28:09.145 --> 28:10.522
right now,
please, kill me.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.607
You don't need to do this.
We'll get Scylla.

28:12.691 --> 28:13.858
That's what I wanted to hear.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.068
Well, that's what we're trying
to do!

28:15.151 --> 28:16.111
We're getting it.

28:16.194 --> 28:17.946
But you have to know
what awaits you

28:18.029 --> 28:20.490
and your loved ones
if you don't.

28:20.573 --> 28:21.908
We understand, okay?

28:21.991 --> 28:22.826
Execute the order.

28:22.909 --> 28:23.952
Please don't do it!

28:25.203 --> 28:26.621
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

28:26.705 --> 28:29.332
Get help, hel...!

28:34.796 --> 28:36.506
I believe
you made a request.

29:05.535 --> 29:08.037
Bagwell, make sure he's dead.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.416
Does everyone understand now?

29:14.711 --> 29:17.338
Are we all on
the same page?

29:20.550 --> 29:21.676
Good.

29:22.927 --> 29:24.763
Let's get down
to business.

29:25.847 --> 29:28.308
Three-quarters
of a billion dollars

29:28.391 --> 29:31.269
in a numerical account
in Luxembourg.

29:31.352 --> 29:34.689
If you are still worried
about humanitarian efforts,

29:34.773 --> 29:36.483
write a check
to UNICEF.

29:39.652 --> 29:42.697
All the data will be delivered
within twenty four hours.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.407
That's what I expected.

29:52.123 --> 29:53.541
You played it perfectly.

29:57.921 --> 30:00.006
Reach out
to our contact in China.

30:00.089 --> 30:01.341
I have a feeling
they may be interested

30:01.424 --> 30:03.343
in what we're selling as well.

30:08.723 --> 30:09.933
Christina, I
don't advise

30:10.016 --> 30:11.518
playing both sides
of this coin.

30:11.601 --> 30:12.977
Pigs get fat

30:13.061 --> 30:14.521
and hogs get slaughtered.

30:21.277 --> 30:24.364
Reach out, to China.

30:37.293 --> 30:38.628
No! Keep our people

30:38.711 --> 30:41.506
at every private airfield
in Florida and in Georgia.

30:41.589 --> 30:44.759
We can't have
Christina leaving the state.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.053
She played on
India's emotions,

30:47.136 --> 30:48.429
which probably means
she'd want to meet

30:48.513 --> 30:49.931
with one of their
emissaries today

30:50.014 --> 30:51.057
while they're
still running hot.

30:51.140 --> 30:52.559
She could still
be in Miami,

30:52.642 --> 30:53.685
maybe at
the embassy.

30:53.768 --> 30:56.271
No, she's not at the embassy.

30:56.354 --> 30:57.438
Any deal she makes
with India

30:57.522 --> 30:58.690
will be
strictly off the radar.

30:58.773 --> 31:01.401
Right now
she's concerned with two things.

31:01.484 --> 31:03.403
One is closing the deal
on Scylla,

31:03.486 --> 31:05.238
which I'm assuming
she's already done,

31:05.321 --> 31:06.906
and the second is getting paid.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.492
No sign of Self.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.454
How much can she get
for Scylla?

31:13.663 --> 31:16.291
Half a billion from India,
the same from China.

31:16.374 --> 31:17.500
Overseas account?

31:17.584 --> 31:18.710
Foreign wire transfer?

31:18.918 --> 31:21.254
I doubt she's taking
any food stamps.

31:22.797 --> 31:24.173
She's going to want confirmation

31:24.257 --> 31:25.508
that that money is
safely overseas

31:25.592 --> 31:27.176
before she leaves the U.S.

31:28.344 --> 31:29.596
We find the money,

31:30.388 --> 31:32.140
we find
my mother.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.058
Normally it takes
three business days

31:34.142 --> 31:36.477
for an international
wire transfer to clear

31:36.561 --> 31:38.354
unless the bank is

31:38.438 --> 31:40.565
a Federal Reserve signatory,
in which case

31:40.648 --> 31:41.983
the transfer is immediate.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.526
You think she'll head
to the bank?

31:43.610 --> 31:45.904
All she has to do is withdraw
a few grand from the millions

31:45.987 --> 31:49.157
that that buyer has probably
transferred overseas

31:49.240 --> 31:50.199
already.

31:50.283 --> 31:52.035
She'll know
it's all there.

31:52.118 --> 31:54.704
So let's find a Federal Reserve
signatory bank in Miami.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.372
We'll have a shot
at finding her.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.082
And Scylla.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.959
There, Michael,
you see, that's

32:00.043 --> 32:01.252
why I didn't put

32:01.336 --> 32:02.420
your name
in the bowl.

32:02.795 --> 32:04.756
You're the only one here
that's irreplaceable.

32:04.964 --> 32:08.134
Agents, informants, muscle--
they're nice to have, but...

32:08.217 --> 32:09.510
finally they're replaceable.

32:10.386 --> 32:11.471
There's a branch

32:11.554 --> 32:12.680
about twenty minutes away.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.390
That mind
of yours...

32:14.474 --> 32:16.184
it's one in a million.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.269
Nice to see it
finally working for me.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.188
I do not work for you.

32:20.772 --> 32:21.814
Not yet.

32:38.581 --> 32:39.916
It's legitimate,

32:40.291 --> 32:41.834
I assure you.

32:42.377 --> 32:43.795
Oh, okay.

32:43.878 --> 32:46.047
I just want
to withdraw the $10,000

32:46.130 --> 32:47.131
so I can be sure

32:47.215 --> 32:49.842
the Luxembourg account
is properly set up.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.512
Of course.

33:10.613 --> 33:11.823
Is she in there?

33:12.156 --> 33:13.574
Yeah, I saw her
through the window.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.077
She's talking to a tall,
dark-haired guy.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.912
They're the same guys
who set us up at the hotel.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.330
We wait until she comes out,

33:19.414 --> 33:20.415
we just jump 'em.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.625
So... what do we do
about her security?

33:22.709 --> 33:25.378
I mean, we jump her, we gotta
jump the guys she's with,

33:25.461 --> 33:27.422
and God knows how many other
agents are gonna come crawling

33:27.505 --> 33:29.340
out of the woodwork like ants.

33:32.343 --> 33:35.722
Look, um...
I hate to bring up the obvious,

33:35.805 --> 33:38.349
but last time I checked,
you two still disagreed

33:38.433 --> 33:39.809
as to what to do
with Scylla

33:39.892 --> 33:41.144
if we actually get it.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.399
Yeah, that's what I thought.

33:46.482 --> 33:48.901
Well, let's skip the damn thing.
I mean, who's gonna stop us?

33:48.985 --> 33:50.153
A seventeen-year-old
security guard?

33:50.236 --> 33:52.613
No, probably the guy
with the gun.

33:52.697 --> 33:55.283
He'll open fire
as soon as he sees our faces.

33:56.909 --> 34:00.121
Then, uh... maybe they
shouldn't see our faces.

34:03.666 --> 34:05.168
So then the pizza guy showed up,

34:05.251 --> 34:06.461
and Wayne jumped
out of the bushes

34:06.544 --> 34:08.296
and tried to grab the pizza,
but the...

34:08.546 --> 34:09.547
but the guy...

34:11.674 --> 34:13.009
My Gosh!

34:18.389 --> 34:19.766
Are you okay, mister?

34:21.642 --> 34:22.685
Yeah.

34:22.769 --> 34:23.895
Go call 911.

34:23.978 --> 34:24.979
No!

34:25.063 --> 34:27.648
No, don't call anyone.

34:28.441 --> 34:29.859
Okay?

34:29.942 --> 34:31.027
Don't call anybody.

34:31.944 --> 34:34.197
Don't call anyone.

34:37.450 --> 34:41.162
You know, once baby brother's
got his little hands

34:41.245 --> 34:42.371
on that magic box of yours,

34:42.455 --> 34:43.790
I don't think it's going
to be too hard for him

34:43.873 --> 34:46.501
to trick Magilla Gorilla,
if you know what I'm saying.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.461
No,
I don't.

34:49.712 --> 34:50.755
And you really think

34:50.838 --> 34:52.298
that Scofield's going
to risk his nephew's life?

34:52.381 --> 34:53.633
He's gonna
figure out something

34:53.716 --> 34:56.260
before he hands first prize
over to the bad guys.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.930
Scofield thinks pure,
like a little Cub Scout.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.349
Burrows, he just thinks
like a cub.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.726
He's right.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.228
I don't feel comfortable
having Scofield

35:05.311 --> 35:06.395
out there with something I want

35:06.479 --> 35:08.648
while I'm stuck here
with nothing he wants.

35:09.649 --> 35:10.983
I need leverage.

35:11.901 --> 35:14.654
You saw the way
Mahone pulled Scofield over

35:14.737 --> 35:16.197
when they first got here.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.406
Bet you a wooden nickel
they was talking

35:17.490 --> 35:19.992
about little Dr. Underpants
and her whereabouts.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.578
Too bad we don't know
where that is.

35:23.329 --> 35:24.747
Wrong again, Curly.

35:24.831 --> 35:27.375
While everyone was up here
flapping their gums,

35:27.458 --> 35:29.877
I took the liberty of toddling
down to Mahone's car,

35:29.961 --> 35:33.089
checking out the last address
he put in his GPS.

35:35.049 --> 35:38.386
There's a gambler's chance
we might find the leverage

35:38.469 --> 35:40.429
you're looking for right here.

35:40.513 --> 35:41.556
I'm on it.

35:41.639 --> 35:42.890
No.

35:47.186 --> 35:49.147
You wanted to get
in on the action,

35:50.565 --> 35:51.899
here's your chance.

35:56.237 --> 35:59.907
Okay, I'll just count this out
for you.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.617
That won't
be necessary.

36:02.827 --> 36:03.870
All righty.

36:03.953 --> 36:06.455
Here's a printed record
of your transaction,

36:06.539 --> 36:07.540
and I think a balance

36:07.623 --> 36:08.916
that high, are you sure

36:09.000 --> 36:11.210
you don't want to talk to one
of our investment specialists?

36:11.294 --> 36:12.461
No, thank you.

36:14.797 --> 36:15.923
Everybody down
on the ground!

36:16.007 --> 36:17.884
Now!
Nobody move,

36:17.967 --> 36:19.218
nobody gets hurt.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.511
You, down.

36:21.220 --> 36:22.346
Oh!

36:22.430 --> 36:23.472
What are the odds?

36:26.684 --> 36:28.102
Don't.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.236
The case.

36:39.488 --> 36:41.115
I'll take that.

36:49.165 --> 36:50.416
Hi, Mom.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.889
Scofield and Burrows
leaving the bank now!

37:21.030 --> 37:22.323
Take Scylla and go!

37:22.406 --> 37:23.449
We gotta stay together!

37:23.532 --> 37:24.450
I said go!

37:24.533 --> 37:25.868
Come on!

37:57.191 --> 38:00.111
I think he's out.
Move in. Move in.

38:05.241 --> 38:06.575
After today's events,

38:06.659 --> 38:08.953
how much egg does the U.S.
court system have on its face

38:09.036 --> 38:10.496
for exonerating Lincoln Burrow

38:10.579 --> 38:11.622
in the first place?

38:11.706 --> 38:14.041
An omelet's worth, Paula.
If you remember

38:14.125 --> 38:15.918
I was never in favor
of the exoneration.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.045
Lincoln Burrows

38:18.129 --> 38:20.423
is a thug for hire, and his
little brother is no better.

38:20.506 --> 38:22.008
I'm amazed

38:22.091 --> 38:24.927
that the court system just
glossed over the warning signs.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.637
- Such as?
- For one,

38:26.721 --> 38:29.181
they should've never let Burrows
and Scofield in the same prison.

38:29.265 --> 38:31.225
They should've looked
at Scofield's past.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.894
It's clear that he had
no criminal background.

38:33.978 --> 38:37.189
Why would a brilliant
structural engineer rob a bank?

38:37.273 --> 38:39.692
Maybe he needed
to pay off his student loans.

38:39.775 --> 38:41.527
It wasn't about the money.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.988
What do you think
the judicial system is going

38:44.071 --> 38:45.364
to learn from all this?

38:45.448 --> 38:48.034
This has been a huge wake-up
call for the courts.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.827
Judges will have to look
at all the relationships

38:49.910 --> 38:52.246
in his life...

39:18.272 --> 39:20.399
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

39:20.483 --> 39:21.901
Easy now, Doc, easy.

39:21.984 --> 39:24.111
It's just your friendly,
neighborhood T-Bag.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.571
Now I'm gonna need
your cooperation.

39:40.252 --> 39:41.420
Get your hands off me,

39:41.504 --> 39:42.588
you son of a...
Hand,

39:42.671 --> 39:43.756
not hands,

39:43.839 --> 39:45.549
thanks to your boyfriend.

39:45.633 --> 39:46.634
Now, as I was
saying before,

39:46.717 --> 39:49.011
I just need
your cooperation.

39:58.312 --> 40:00.147
Do it here!

40:06.862 --> 40:07.905
All right.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.324
All right.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.035
He's taking too long.

40:13.119 --> 40:14.662
Something's wrong.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.122
We gotta go back for him.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.081
He said he'd catch up.

40:17.331 --> 40:18.707
No, something's wrong.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.252
Call him.

40:22.169 --> 40:23.379
Call him.

40:29.760 --> 40:30.761
Michael,

40:32.763 --> 40:34.765
now that we have this,

40:34.849 --> 40:36.559
what the hell are we
going to do with it?

40:44.150 --> 40:45.401
He's not answering.

40:47.695 --> 40:49.029
Linc?

40:49.155 --> 40:51.866
I heard about the bank
robbery on the radio.

40:52.408 --> 40:55.995
You boys just can't stand to be
out of the news, can you?

40:57.246 --> 40:58.998
I assume you've got Scylla?

40:59.081 --> 41:00.833
We're getting close.

41:00.916 --> 41:01.917
We'll keep you posted.

41:02.001 --> 41:04.003
I wouldn't hang up just yet
if I were you, son.

41:07.047 --> 41:08.716
Michael, we're in the apartment.

41:10.551 --> 41:12.094
I know you have it.

41:12.219 --> 41:13.179
Otherwise,

41:13.262 --> 41:15.431
Christina would never have
risked a public shootout.

41:15.681 --> 41:16.932
Now, I'm going to make

41:17.016 --> 41:18.559
this easy for you.

41:18.767 --> 41:19.894
Bring me Scylla,

41:20.311 --> 41:23.272
or this time, Sara's death
will not be faked.

41:30.946 --> 41:32.364
What is it?

41:33.866 --> 41:35.284
What is it?

41:39.038 --> 41:40.456
The General has Sarah.

41:47.922 --> 41:49.548
Take it.

41:53.677 --> 41:56.639
I swear if you touch her...

41:56.722 --> 41:58.182
Hello, son.

42:02.645 --> 42:04.480
I believe you have
something I want.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.649
And I have something you want,

42:06.732 --> 42:08.817
although I'll never really
understand why.

42:08.901 --> 42:10.444
All right,

42:10.736 --> 42:12.446
maybe we can work
something out.

42:12.571 --> 42:14.448
I gave you the opportunity

42:14.532 --> 42:16.951
to work something out.

42:17.910 --> 42:19.828
You rejected me, Michael.

42:19.912 --> 42:21.789
Look, let's meet
and talk about this.

42:21.872 --> 42:22.831
Now the time for talking

42:22.915 --> 42:23.999
passed about the time

42:24.083 --> 42:25.125
you put those ski masks on,

42:25.209 --> 42:26.210
don't you think?

42:26.293 --> 42:29.171
So, here's what I'm going to do,
Michael.

42:29.338 --> 42:30.339
I'm going to shoot Lincoln

42:30.422 --> 42:32.049
through the right rib cage,

42:32.216 --> 42:33.884
just grazing

42:33.968 --> 42:35.052
the lower quadrant

42:35.135 --> 42:36.136
of his right lung.

42:36.262 --> 42:37.513
It will slowly collapse,

42:37.596 --> 42:39.932
making it very difficult
to breathe.

42:40.266 --> 42:41.850
If he doesn't get
medical attention,

42:41.934 --> 42:43.269
within five hours,

42:43.352 --> 42:44.562
he'll be dead.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.524
Christina... Mom... please...

42:54.822 --> 42:55.781
Linc!

42:58.576 --> 43:00.995
Second hand's spinning,
Michael.

43:01.453 --> 43:03.706
Looks like you have
a little decision to make.

43:03.789 --> 43:04.832
Scylla

43:05.457 --> 43:06.875
or someone you love.
