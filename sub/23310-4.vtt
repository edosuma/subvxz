WEBVTT

00:04.871 --> 00:05.787
-Sure.

00:06.037 --> 00:07.829
-You have great tits.

00:07.829 --> 00:09.078
♪  ♪

00:09.078 --> 00:12.287
I just got my friend Bret here
to loan us a Pelts.

00:12.287 --> 00:14.078
It looks like shit. Literally.

00:14.871 --> 00:15.662
I'm Jackie.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.245
My daughter and I are moving
into the neighborhood.

00:17.829 --> 00:19.912
ROBERT DUFRESNE:
There's no way I'm gonna
sell my house for that price.

00:19.912 --> 00:20.995
I was low-balling you!

00:20.995 --> 00:22.829
I loved your house
the minute I walked in.

00:22.829 --> 00:25.454
What you're saying is that you'd
wanna have sex with my house?

00:25.454 --> 00:27.120
I'd blow it
and see where that goes.

00:28.120 --> 00:31.203
I spent so much time focusing
on the divorce that I

00:31.203 --> 00:33.412
didn't even let myself think
about the future.

00:33.412 --> 00:34.662
Do you wanna get dinner with me?

00:34.662 --> 00:37.579
I think I should just
be on my own for a bit.

00:37.579 --> 00:38.621
Oh.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.454
I think I met someone.

00:40.953 --> 00:42.120
Tell me about him.

00:50.078 --> 00:52.579
All these human beings

00:52.579 --> 00:55.662
being rejected in
a matter of seconds.

00:55.662 --> 00:57.995
Yes, it's a great time
to be alive, isn't it?

00:57.995 --> 00:59.746
What's the math?
What's the math?

00:59.746 --> 01:02.120
How many blow-offs
is that per minute?

01:02.120 --> 01:04.995
God, you are really
milking all the fun
out of this.

01:04.995 --> 01:08.037
Just, you know,
jump in the water
and get wet.

01:08.037 --> 01:09.621
I'm not afraid
of getting wet,

01:09.621 --> 01:12.412
I'm just saying that
there is an inherent-- huh.

01:12.412 --> 01:14.871
- Well he looks
kind of nice.
- Wow!

01:14.871 --> 01:16.120
- Sam.
- Sam's cute.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.662
Hmm.

01:17.662 --> 01:19.953
Is that a giraffe
in the background?

01:19.953 --> 01:22.495
Wait a minute.

01:22.495 --> 01:24.329
- I can do--
- Oh, yes.

01:24.329 --> 01:26.120
Indeed,
that is a giraffe.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.329
Wow.

01:27.329 --> 01:29.162
I've always wanted
to go on a safari.

01:29.162 --> 01:30.746
Well, it could be
at the zoo.

01:30.746 --> 01:32.579
I don't understand
why you don't want me

01:32.579 --> 01:34.454
to have, like,
this nice fantasy.

01:34.454 --> 01:35.746
Come on,
give me that back.

01:35.746 --> 01:37.829
No, no, no, no, no!
What are you doing?!

01:37.829 --> 01:39.912
You didn't
ask permission!

01:39.912 --> 01:42.495
It's a match!
I don't believe it!

01:42.495 --> 01:44.995
What-- don't act so--
what are you writing?

01:44.995 --> 01:46.412
What are you writing?
What are you writing?

01:46.412 --> 01:47.995
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Wait, seriously.

01:47.995 --> 01:49.704
!
- Seriously. I'm serious!

01:49.704 --> 01:51.995
Hold on, hold on!
Yes!

01:51.995 --> 01:53.746
- He said yes!
- Give me my phone!

01:53.746 --> 01:54.829
He said yes
to what?!

02:01.829 --> 02:04.287
Robert:
Tom, you have
your socks, homework,

02:04.287 --> 02:07.245
and video games
where everybody
kills everybody?

02:07.245 --> 02:09.370
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry for spilling

02:09.370 --> 02:10.995
my nail polish
in the bathroom.

02:10.995 --> 02:13.203
Oh, you mean
the red nail polish
in the grout?

02:13.203 --> 02:15.953
Oh, come on,
that'll clean up
like a dream.

02:22.495 --> 02:23.621
Hmm.

02:25.203 --> 02:26.329
Hello?

02:28.245 --> 02:29.203
What?

02:29.203 --> 02:30.787
When did that
happen?

02:33.912 --> 02:35.746
- Tom and Lila: Hey!
- Hi!

02:37.287 --> 02:39.871
- Yeah, it was good.

02:39.871 --> 02:43.162
- Grandpa's
in the hospital.

02:46.454 --> 02:47.912
- See you guys!
- Both: Bye, Dad!

02:47.912 --> 02:50.995
- Uh, acute pneumonia,

02:50.995 --> 02:53.162
which is pretty serious
at his age,

02:53.162 --> 02:56.329
and then, you know,
he's got the heart condition.

02:56.329 --> 02:57.454
Oh, my God.

02:57.454 --> 02:59.120
Doctors
have recommended

02:59.120 --> 03:00.912
that I get there
as quickly as possible.

03:00.912 --> 03:05.162
But, um,
it could be the end.

03:05.162 --> 03:07.078
Oh, my God, Robert,
I'm sorry.

03:07.078 --> 03:09.078
So when
are you leaving?

03:09.078 --> 03:11.120
The first flight
tomorrow morning.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.412
Got the last seat.

03:12.412 --> 03:14.245
But do you--
should--

03:14.245 --> 03:16.037
do you want me--
should I go with you?

03:16.037 --> 03:18.287
No, no,
think I need to
travel light on this one.

03:18.287 --> 03:21.078
It's just there's
a lot of things that
have to be handled,

03:21.078 --> 03:25.329
and just dealing
with my sister alone
is gonna be a ground war.

03:25.329 --> 03:28.662
- But thanks.
- Don't let Cathy
get to you.

03:28.662 --> 03:29.871
Yeah.

03:31.537 --> 03:34.621
All right, well,
seriously, I mean it,

03:34.621 --> 03:37.579
if you change your mind
and you want me there,
I'll jump on a plane.

03:37.579 --> 03:41.662
Yeah, I think
it's probably
easier this way.

03:41.662 --> 03:43.746
- Thanks.
- Mm.

03:51.953 --> 03:53.912
( siren blaring
in distance )

04:17.912 --> 04:20.621
( heart monitor
beeping )

04:20.621 --> 04:22.662
Hey, Dad.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.829
It's Robert.

04:24.829 --> 04:27.203
I'm here now.

04:27.203 --> 04:30.203
I'm not going
anywhere.

04:30.203 --> 04:32.412
Man:
He's out
like a light.

04:32.412 --> 04:34.495
Haven't heard
a peep out of him.

04:34.495 --> 04:36.203
His color's
good, though.

04:39.454 --> 04:41.162
- Okay.
- You know,
when he comes to,

04:41.162 --> 04:44.495
you might wanna consider
going premium on the TV.

04:44.495 --> 04:46.454
- They're upgrading
the whole building.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.037
146 channels
in every room.

04:49.037 --> 04:50.495
Just six bucks
a week.

04:53.871 --> 04:55.912
That was weird.

05:26.787 --> 05:32.162
I just don't feel good
about not being with him,
you know?

05:32.162 --> 05:35.537
I mean,
if we were still married,
I'd just-- I would there.

05:35.537 --> 05:37.162
There'd be
no question.

05:37.162 --> 05:38.412
And I feel guilty

05:38.412 --> 05:42.120
because even though
a part of me wanted to go,

05:42.120 --> 05:44.912
I had this little,
like, "Ah,"

05:44.912 --> 05:47.787
this sigh of relief
when he told me he didn't
want me to go.

05:47.787 --> 05:49.037
You're divorced now.
You're free.

05:49.037 --> 05:50.704
Diane,
I was married forever.

05:50.704 --> 05:53.078
These
feelings are--

05:53.078 --> 05:56.245
they're--
they're involuntary.

05:56.245 --> 05:58.912
Well, tick-tock,
time to make new feelings.

05:58.912 --> 06:03.078
Well, I just
feel shitty about it.

06:03.078 --> 06:04.871
- I feel shitty for Robert.

06:04.871 --> 06:06.537
- Hi!
- Oh, hello!

06:06.537 --> 06:07.995
- Hello.
- Hi.

06:07.995 --> 06:10.245
What did you say
this sculpture
is worth again?

06:10.245 --> 06:12.287
Well, it is
on loan currently,

06:12.287 --> 06:14.829
and it is just south
of $2 million.

06:14.829 --> 06:16.454
Told ya.
You owe me dinner.

06:16.454 --> 06:18.120
- Shit.
- Okay, well,
thanks again.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.621
- You're welcome.

06:20.621 --> 06:22.912
- Woman: Oh, my God!

06:24.412 --> 06:26.662
That is what
you call buzz.

06:27.787 --> 06:29.245
That's buzz?

06:29.245 --> 06:31.078
- ...by sports...

06:31.078 --> 06:34.454
So I got you the premium
cable package, Dad.

06:34.454 --> 06:38.287
It's a fucking sweet
selection.

06:38.287 --> 06:41.329
...while Molly the bear
was tranquilized...

06:41.329 --> 06:44.579
Well, feeling better
these days.

06:45.829 --> 06:48.120
Better than before.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.829
I'm not gonna drag you
through all the gory details.

06:51.829 --> 06:56.621
Just suffice it
to say it sucked,

06:56.621 --> 06:58.829
in case you were
worried about me.

06:58.829 --> 07:03.078
Not that you were ever
a big worrier,

07:03.078 --> 07:06.829
but...
I don't know.

07:06.829 --> 07:11.995
Sometimes I wish
I could be more like you.

07:14.662 --> 07:16.412
It's hard, though.

07:20.287 --> 07:21.704
If you're like
many Americans...

07:21.704 --> 07:23.662
Dad, it's
"The Lone Ranger"!

07:23.662 --> 07:24.787
That used to be
your favorite!

07:24.787 --> 07:27.662
Huh, isn't it crazy?

07:27.662 --> 07:31.370
Check in the hospital
with pneumonia and
a high fever,

07:31.370 --> 07:35.953
get a "Lone Ranger"
marathon out of the deal.

07:39.537 --> 07:41.537
Yeah,
life's funny.

07:41.537 --> 07:45.245
He's sweet, he's funny,
he's handsome.

07:45.245 --> 07:48.245
It's-- it's like I hit
the motherfucking Powerball.

07:48.245 --> 07:52.162
- And he actually
makes me happy.
- I can tell.

07:52.162 --> 07:54.746
And he is 100%
not judgmental.

07:54.746 --> 07:57.912
You know, most men,
they meet a woman
in their 40s,

07:57.912 --> 08:00.203
never been married,
with a teenage daughter,

08:00.203 --> 08:02.287
and their eyes
just glaze over.

08:02.287 --> 08:03.746
But not Robbie.

08:03.746 --> 08:06.162
He's, like,
completely unfazed.

08:06.162 --> 08:08.662
Wow, we may have to
bottle this guy.

08:08.662 --> 08:10.912
Just bear in mind
that most relationships,

08:10.912 --> 08:13.912
they go through
an early euphoric period,
they level off,

08:13.912 --> 08:17.037
and-- and I just--
I wouldn't make any big
life changes right now.

08:17.037 --> 08:20.912
You're probably right,
and I haven't even met
his ex-wife yet.

08:20.912 --> 08:23.829
Well, there you have it.
So there's another bit
of mountain to climb.

08:23.829 --> 08:27.329
Yeah.
And this chick
sounds batshit crazy.

08:27.329 --> 08:29.662
Luckily for you,
she's not your problem.

08:29.662 --> 08:32.579
- Frances: I'm here to see
a patient-- Frank DuFresne.

08:32.579 --> 08:36.871
- Capital D-U-F-R...

08:36.871 --> 08:42.329
- ...E--
sorry-- E-S-N-E.
- Oh, God damn it.

08:42.329 --> 08:45.995
- I got it, thanks.
- Robert: The one thing
that I asked of you,

08:45.995 --> 08:47.829
and you couldn't even
respect that?

08:47.829 --> 08:50.454
I didn't want you
to go through this
by yourself.

08:50.454 --> 08:52.746
I felt like
I should be here.

08:52.746 --> 08:55.579
You would do the exact
same thing for me.

08:55.579 --> 08:59.245
- All right.

08:59.245 --> 09:00.662
How'd you get
the kids squared away?

09:00.662 --> 09:02.203
Oh, that was easy
'cause Lila got to

09:02.203 --> 09:03.746
go to Rachel's
for the weekend

09:03.746 --> 09:08.454
and Tom is
at home with Diane
checking in on him.

09:09.829 --> 09:11.912
Roomies with Diane?

09:11.912 --> 09:15.412
- Ugh.

09:15.412 --> 09:18.621
As usual,
she lives 30 miles away,

09:18.621 --> 09:22.287
but acts like she's taking
a submarine from Ukraine.

09:22.287 --> 09:24.912
The more she's away,
the more pleasant for you.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.621
- Yeah.

09:26.621 --> 09:28.454
Yeah, I'll just
handle everything

09:28.454 --> 09:34.120
and her contribution
will be to skyrocket
my blood pressure.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.329
Good thing mine's
low to begin with.

09:44.412 --> 09:46.787
- A gallery.

09:48.495 --> 09:49.787
- Diane: Yoo-hoo!

09:49.787 --> 09:51.454
Hello!

09:51.454 --> 09:55.621
Just checking in
as advertised.

09:55.621 --> 09:59.162
Making sure
you're okay.

09:59.162 --> 10:03.162
So...

10:03.162 --> 10:05.829
So to clear the air,
your mother never claimed
you were helpless,

10:05.829 --> 10:07.579
so you can
put all that
out of your mind

10:07.579 --> 10:10.412
and just think of me
as a buddy-type

10:10.412 --> 10:13.454
who's just checking in
on you from time to time.

10:13.454 --> 10:15.746
Does that mean
I can ask you to leave?

10:15.746 --> 10:17.537
Very witty.

10:17.537 --> 10:21.203
I like a young man
with a sense of humor.

10:22.495 --> 10:23.995
- So...

10:26.078 --> 10:29.829
So what's doin'
at school these days?

10:35.704 --> 10:38.704
You know what I always
used to love?
School dances.

10:38.704 --> 10:43.245
What are the names
of the top dances that
the kids are doing these days?

10:43.245 --> 10:44.787
Just the top 10.
Last to first,

10:44.787 --> 10:47.579
or first to last,
whatever you want.

10:47.579 --> 10:50.621
I'm gonna go rinse out
my cereal bowl.

10:55.704 --> 10:58.078
Is that
an Audi RS 7?

10:58.078 --> 11:01.704
I don't know
the exact make and model,
but that is my car indeed.

11:01.704 --> 11:04.662
- Frances:
His color looks good.

11:04.662 --> 11:07.454
Frances thinks
you have good color.

11:07.454 --> 11:11.537
He-- he likes
your voice.

11:15.412 --> 11:18.579
Well, actually,
Frank, you know what I was
remembering on the plane?

11:18.579 --> 11:21.412
The time that Robert and I
came down to visit you guys

11:21.412 --> 11:23.495
and, um,
we went to Sears.

11:23.495 --> 11:26.829
- We bought a lawn mower.
- Oh, wait, no, it was an edger.

11:26.829 --> 11:28.912
- Yeah. Do you remember
that, Dad?

11:28.912 --> 11:31.746
We bought that
Sears Craftsman edger.

11:31.746 --> 11:34.953
That thing was like
a bologna slicer
on wheels.

11:34.953 --> 11:36.621
Yeah.

11:36.621 --> 11:39.829
And then we, um--
we went to some kind
of drive-in place,

11:39.829 --> 11:42.746
you know, and it had,
like, a big hat on the roof.

11:42.746 --> 11:45.287
- Oh, Hatburger.
- Yeah, yeah, Hatburger!

11:45.287 --> 11:46.495
Yeah. God.

11:46.495 --> 11:50.120
Man, they closed that
shitbox down years ago.

11:50.120 --> 11:52.329
That was before
the kids were born.

11:52.329 --> 11:56.162
And you made me order
this really messy,
massive burger

11:56.162 --> 11:58.621
with, like, five patties
stacked on it.

11:58.621 --> 12:00.871
- Oh, the juicy stovepipe.

12:00.871 --> 12:03.621
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

12:03.621 --> 12:05.120
And I did not
make you order it.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.953
You ordered it,
and I was appalled

12:07.953 --> 12:10.454
at how you inhaled it
like a linebacker.

12:10.454 --> 12:12.787
Oh, my God,
that burger was
so goddamn good.

12:12.787 --> 12:15.787
I vaguely remember
that your Dad

12:15.787 --> 12:17.787
got really angry
at the carhop

12:17.787 --> 12:19.287
for some reason
that I don't remember,

12:19.287 --> 12:21.495
and he--
but he called him
a cement head.

12:21.495 --> 12:24.454
Oh, yeah, yep.
Remember that, Dad,
cement head?

12:24.454 --> 12:26.746
That was
one of your favorites.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.662
The cement head allegation
was leveled at me

12:29.662 --> 12:32.245
hundreds of times
over the years.

12:32.245 --> 12:34.995
I remember one time
he called my mom
a cement head.

12:34.995 --> 12:37.662
Hey, remember, Dad?
She bought the wrong
boat polish

12:37.662 --> 12:40.162
and you--
you threw it

12:40.162 --> 12:42.454
and it exploded
on the wall.

12:42.454 --> 12:43.787
Yeah.

12:48.787 --> 12:50.287
I'm gonna go
get some air.

12:50.287 --> 12:51.495
Do you want me
to come with you?

12:51.495 --> 12:52.662
No, it's
all right.

12:52.662 --> 12:56.162
Again, just get
some fresh air.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.120
Uh, Frank,
I don't know
if you're aware of this,

13:10.120 --> 13:12.537
but they've
put you in a--

13:12.537 --> 13:17.495
a sort of
creamsicle-colored gown,

13:17.495 --> 13:21.287
which-- which you pull off,
you know, by the way.

13:28.995 --> 13:30.537
I feel kind of lousy
that we didn't

13:30.537 --> 13:32.912
get to know each other
better over the years.

13:34.953 --> 13:37.995
But there-- there are
a couple of things

13:37.995 --> 13:39.495
I would like you
to know.

13:40.704 --> 13:43.037
First of all,
that--

13:43.037 --> 13:46.454
that your son
loves you very, very much.

13:46.454 --> 13:48.704
And he talks
about you all time.

13:48.704 --> 13:51.203
He's always
telling us stories,
me and the kids,

13:51.203 --> 13:54.370
about you guys taking
fishing trips or, um...

13:54.370 --> 13:59.078
just some crazy thing he did
that you beat his ass for.

13:59.078 --> 14:02.495
"That you beat his ass for,"
those are-- that's-- those
are his words.

14:03.746 --> 14:07.203
But I would also
very much want you to know

14:07.203 --> 14:10.412
that-- that you mean
a lot to me

14:10.412 --> 14:12.912
because you mean
a lot to him.

14:23.162 --> 14:25.370
This is very nice.

14:28.953 --> 14:32.787
Hey, wait,
isn't this-- yeah.

14:32.787 --> 14:34.829
This is the street that
connects right-- yeah--

14:34.829 --> 14:37.329
- to that hill, right,
where we went sledding?
- Mm-hmm.

14:37.329 --> 14:39.037
- Yes.
- Yes.

14:39.037 --> 14:40.787
- Steel trap.
- I took you sledding,

14:40.787 --> 14:44.537
and you wore
that puffy coat
that I hated.

14:44.537 --> 14:48.829
Right, you mean my--
that-- my loden green
L.L. Bean coat?

14:48.829 --> 14:52.621
Yeah. Yeah,
I brought you home
to show you off,

14:52.621 --> 14:56.245
let everybody see
my sweet, beautiful,

14:56.245 --> 14:58.662
smoking hot,
piece-of-ass girlfriend.

14:58.662 --> 15:01.746
Then you walked around looking
like the Michelin Man
the whole time.

15:01.746 --> 15:03.454
Listen, I bought
that coat for you.

15:03.454 --> 15:06.871
You told me to
respect Ohio winters.
You recall that?

15:08.495 --> 15:10.287
All right, so what else
do we need to get your dad?

15:10.287 --> 15:11.912
We gotta get clippers,
nail clippers,

15:11.912 --> 15:13.454
'cause I saw
those toe shovels.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.621
It's a disaster.
I gotta clip those.

15:15.621 --> 15:16.995
Oh, my God,

15:16.995 --> 15:21.495
the day that
clipping toenails
becomes a two-man job,

15:21.495 --> 15:23.995
just give me
an ice pick in the earhole

15:23.995 --> 15:27.953
- and leave me in the alley.
- Yeah, ditto, me, too.

15:29.495 --> 15:31.829
I used to steal
a lot of candy in here.

15:31.829 --> 15:36.120
And later in high school,
I stole a lot of rubbers.

15:37.579 --> 15:40.495
It's like a story
out of Mark Twain.

15:40.495 --> 15:43.329
- Robert: Hello, Cathy.

15:43.329 --> 15:46.995
There you are!
I was so worried you
skipped town or something.

15:46.995 --> 15:49.621
No, we went over to Cary's
to get some stuff for Dad.

15:49.621 --> 15:51.746
Oh! Oh,
that was nice.
So you saved me a trip.

15:51.746 --> 15:53.662
I was just gonna do
the same thing.

15:53.662 --> 15:56.162
Hey there,
cutie-a-gootie!

15:56.162 --> 15:58.871
That was nice of you
to drag yourself here.

15:58.871 --> 16:01.370
- Hey, Cathy!
You look great.
- Thanks, so do you!

16:01.370 --> 16:04.704
Did you, uh--
did you put on
a couple pounds?

16:04.704 --> 16:07.495
'Cause last time I saw you,
you were really skinny.

16:07.495 --> 16:10.245
- Oh, yeah,
like emaciated.

16:10.245 --> 16:13.037
I was really worried.
I prayed for you.

16:13.037 --> 16:15.287
I'm sure there's a--

16:15.287 --> 16:17.370
there's a compliment
buried in there somewhere.

16:17.370 --> 16:21.078
- No, there isn't.
- And look you, Mr.
Lost-the-Mustache!

16:21.078 --> 16:22.287
Finally!

16:22.287 --> 16:23.995
The world only needs
one Tom Selleck,

16:23.995 --> 16:26.454
- Two Tom Sellecks,

16:26.454 --> 16:28.287
that's an embarrassment
of riches.

16:28.287 --> 16:29.621
I'm just gonna
come out and say it--

16:29.621 --> 16:30.953
divorce or no divorce,

16:30.953 --> 16:33.162
you two look like
a thousand bucks.

16:33.162 --> 16:35.704
- Very generous.
- 500 each, thank you.

16:35.704 --> 16:38.245
I'm really
enjoying this, Tom.

16:38.245 --> 16:40.037
- Yeah!

16:40.037 --> 16:42.454
This flat-bottom
steering wheel is nuts.

16:42.454 --> 16:44.912
Mm, I just feel
so relaxed.

16:44.912 --> 16:46.871
I can do
all my errands,

16:46.871 --> 16:50.370
not have to worry about
finding a parking space.

16:50.370 --> 16:52.579
- Oh, wait, shit. Stop, stop!

16:52.579 --> 16:55.579
Great, now
can you back up?

16:55.579 --> 16:58.412
Oh, good, my girl's
working today.

16:58.412 --> 16:59.871
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

16:59.871 --> 17:01.621
Watch it, idiot!

17:01.621 --> 17:02.995
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

17:02.995 --> 17:04.871
- Don't you cuss at him!

17:04.871 --> 17:06.245
He is a very good
driver!

17:06.245 --> 17:08.329
Why don't you learn
to walk, you schmuck?!

17:08.329 --> 17:10.495
- He almost
backed right into me!

17:10.495 --> 17:13.245
Where's a cop?
I don't like your tone, mister!

17:13.245 --> 17:14.579
It's very threatening,

17:14.579 --> 17:16.912
and I can see that
you're staring at my tits.

17:16.912 --> 17:18.953
Yeah, walk away!

17:18.953 --> 17:21.995
Big tough guy,
acting all tough,
hitting a car.

17:21.995 --> 17:24.495
Go ahead,
walk away, walk away!

17:25.912 --> 17:27.953
What an asshole,
right?

17:27.953 --> 17:30.037
All right,
hit the flashers, hon.

17:30.037 --> 17:31.412
She's fast.
I'll be back 10.

17:34.329 --> 17:35.953
Copy that.

17:35.953 --> 17:37.787
Wish I didn't
have to leave tomorrow,

17:37.787 --> 17:39.120
but we're getting
the furnace cleaned

17:39.120 --> 17:40.953
and Larry's getting
his toe fixed.

17:40.953 --> 17:44.203
But I'll try to make it back
by the end of the week.

17:44.203 --> 17:46.203
Boy, that one
conks out easy, huh?

17:46.203 --> 17:50.454
Yeah, she left
her house at 4:30
to catch a 7:00 AM flight.

17:50.454 --> 17:53.162
Well, first class,
I hear it's a vacation
in itself.

17:53.162 --> 17:56.953
- Of course, I wouldn't know.
- I'm not sleeping, and I was
in steerage.

17:56.953 --> 18:00.787
What's this?
"Weekly premium
cable service, $6."

18:00.787 --> 18:03.662
Oh wait, I'm sorry,
"6.36 with tax."

18:03.662 --> 18:06.662
Yeah, I upgraded
his TV package, okay?

18:06.662 --> 18:08.912
My hands were tied
when it came to the tax.

18:08.912 --> 18:10.662
And you didn't think
to check with me first?

18:10.662 --> 18:12.245
We share
a power of attorney.

18:12.245 --> 18:14.329
It's a teeny
upgrade, Cathy.

18:14.329 --> 18:16.871
He likes Westerns.
I thought it might be nice

18:16.871 --> 18:19.329
to have something playing
in the background
just in case.

18:19.329 --> 18:21.162
In case what?
He's sedated

18:21.162 --> 18:22.746
and he could linger
a long time.

18:22.746 --> 18:24.203
You know,
expenses add up.

18:24.203 --> 18:27.329
He needs 146 channels
like he needs mambo lessons.

18:27.329 --> 18:29.662
But you just love to piss
my money away, don't you?

18:29.662 --> 18:32.787
Okay, you know what, Cathy?
Cable's on us, our treat.

18:32.787 --> 18:34.746
Nobody asked you
for anything.

18:34.746 --> 18:37.953
Of course not,
because then you don't
get to be the hero.

18:37.953 --> 18:40.871
Because after all,
no one cares about Dad
except for you.

18:40.871 --> 18:42.871
Jesus Christ
has arrived

18:42.871 --> 18:44.579
all the way
from New York,

18:44.579 --> 18:46.537
so bow down
and kiss his fat ass!

18:46.537 --> 18:48.662
Okay, okay, easy,
easy, Cathy, come on.

18:48.662 --> 18:50.621
How much did you
care about Dad

18:50.621 --> 18:54.287
whenever you ran off
with your drug dealing
boyfriend in high school?

18:54.287 --> 18:56.078
I had to drive nine hours
to Pennsylvania

18:56.078 --> 18:58.078
- to drag your butt back.
- Robert, shh.

18:58.078 --> 19:00.203
You remember that?
Mom cried for three days.

19:00.203 --> 19:03.579
You were filthy
and you smelled like
a miniature donkey.

19:03.579 --> 19:05.537
That is youth.
That was Shakespeare.

19:05.537 --> 19:07.287
Of course,
you wouldn't know
anything about passion.

19:07.287 --> 19:09.370
You know what?
Tell you what,

19:09.370 --> 19:10.829
let's just
get on the record

19:10.829 --> 19:13.120
that Cathy paid for
half the cable bill,
all right?

19:13.120 --> 19:15.245
Cathy, no one expects you
to pay for anything.

19:15.245 --> 19:18.287
- You've been
so helpful as it is.
- It's not about the cable!

19:18.287 --> 19:20.662
- This guy has a long,
brutal history...
- Okay, okay.

19:20.662 --> 19:22.412
...of calling
my character into question

19:22.412 --> 19:25.037
because he's angry
and he's bitter, okay?

19:25.037 --> 19:27.579
That's all about his own
little shortcomings
right there.

19:27.579 --> 19:29.245
Robert:
There's an
alternative theory here

19:29.245 --> 19:32.120
that maybe you drive
everybody around you,

19:32.120 --> 19:34.621
including me,
fucking batshit.

19:34.621 --> 19:36.871
That's why Larry,
your pussy-whipped husband,

19:36.871 --> 19:39.203
works double shifts
to stay away from you.

19:39.203 --> 19:41.078
And he tried
to kill himself.

19:41.078 --> 19:43.245
Okay, water under the bridge,
water under the bridge.

19:43.245 --> 19:44.704
No, you see how red
he's getting?

19:44.704 --> 19:47.287
That's literally the guilt
rising to the surface, okay?

19:47.287 --> 19:48.912
Now he's gonna
go punch a wall.

19:48.912 --> 19:51.287
We had holes in every room
in the house growing up.

19:51.287 --> 19:53.245
- Oh, Daddy!

19:53.245 --> 19:55.579
Oh, there you go, Daddy!
It's okay!

19:55.579 --> 19:58.203
It's me, Cathy.
Can you hear me?

19:58.203 --> 20:01.078
Daddy, it's okay
to let go.

20:01.078 --> 20:04.454
Find peace!
Go play fetch
with Chester.

20:04.454 --> 20:06.621
Don't tell him
to go play fetch
with Chester!

20:06.621 --> 20:08.454
- Robert, just calm down.
- Chester's a dead dog.

20:08.454 --> 20:10.454
- Let go, Daddy!

20:10.454 --> 20:13.746
It's been a long time!
Find Nana and Pop-Pop!

20:13.746 --> 20:15.454
I'm trying
to stay cool, okay,

20:15.454 --> 20:18.912
but in about two seconds,
I-- I have to choke her
to death.

20:18.912 --> 20:20.912
Okay, Robert, just don't
talk to Cathy.
Cathy!

20:20.912 --> 20:22.579
What's my father's robe
doing here?

20:22.579 --> 20:25.287
If you're taking stuff
from the house...

20:25.287 --> 20:27.370
You got us red-handed
there, Cathy.

20:27.370 --> 20:30.829
We stole Dad's
40-year-old robe

20:30.829 --> 20:32.537
and some
hearing aid batteries.

20:32.537 --> 20:33.871
Later, we were
thinking about

20:33.871 --> 20:35.621
maybe knocking off
a stagecoach.

20:35.621 --> 20:38.037
Okay, I'm going over there
right now, all right?

20:38.037 --> 20:41.120
Because I have
an entire list of things
that Dad promised me--

20:41.120 --> 20:43.370
Mom's wedding ring,
his Navy uniform,

20:43.370 --> 20:44.787
and the green
Fiestaware pitcher.

20:44.787 --> 20:47.203
And God help you
if I see one thing missing.

20:47.203 --> 20:49.995
Well, whenever
you get there,
do me a quick favor

20:49.995 --> 20:53.120
and shove the green
Fiestaware pitcher
up your ass.

20:57.621 --> 21:02.162
♪ And those of us
with ravaged faces ♪

21:02.162 --> 21:05.787
♪ Lacking in

21:17.329 --> 21:19.454
You know, Tom, I had
a really good time today.

21:19.454 --> 21:22.537
- And we got a lot done.
- Yeah!

21:22.537 --> 21:23.746
We're a good team.

21:23.746 --> 21:25.953
You and me,
me and you,

21:25.953 --> 21:29.412
together,
we get a lot done.

21:29.412 --> 21:31.787
High five.

21:31.787 --> 21:35.454
Tell you what,
why don't we stop at
The Brass Crow on the way home

21:35.454 --> 21:37.787
and treat ourselves
to something cute?

21:37.787 --> 21:39.329
What is
The Brass Crow?

21:41.037 --> 21:43.287
Sweetie, I have to be
totally honest,

21:43.287 --> 21:45.995
it looks surprisingly
gay on you.

21:45.995 --> 21:47.537
Do you wanna try
another color?

21:47.537 --> 21:49.495
No, thank you,
please.

21:49.495 --> 21:51.203
Okay, I need
your opinion now.

21:51.203 --> 21:53.287
What do you think
of this skirt?

21:54.871 --> 21:57.329
I mean, the zipper
isn't the whole way up
in the back.

21:57.329 --> 21:59.329
- Is it supposed to
be like that?

21:59.329 --> 22:01.203
Can I grab you
another size?

22:01.203 --> 22:03.412
No, this is a four
and I wear a four.

22:03.412 --> 22:05.704
But you're
more than welcome
to grab me a two

22:05.704 --> 22:07.829
as long as
it doesn't have
a defective zipper

22:07.829 --> 22:09.579
like your
fucking four.

22:14.162 --> 22:16.995
Tom, factory flaws aside,
truthfully,

22:16.995 --> 22:18.579
tell me what do you think
of this skirt?

22:18.579 --> 22:22.537
- It's kind of cool, actually.

22:22.537 --> 22:25.829
- Maybe just get, like,
a bigger size,

22:25.829 --> 22:28.037
you know,
just for comfort.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.454
Yeah.

22:37.329 --> 22:39.454
Fuck this.

22:41.579 --> 22:43.287
Mrs. Clavowen?

22:43.287 --> 22:45.912
Diane: Get the car,
I wanna get the fuck
out of here.

23:02.078 --> 23:04.746
Robert.
Robert, he's awake.

23:04.746 --> 23:07.621
Dad. Dad!

23:07.621 --> 23:09.704
Hey.

23:09.704 --> 23:12.287
How are you--
how are you feeling?

23:18.953 --> 23:20.370
Where's Cathy?

23:22.995 --> 23:25.787
Um, you know, she went
to run some errands

23:25.787 --> 23:28.454
and-- and she's
on her way back, so.

23:28.454 --> 23:31.995
Yeah, Cathy is--
she's a doer.

23:31.995 --> 23:35.203
Your eyes are
so beautiful, Frank.

23:35.203 --> 23:37.662
Gosh, I forgot how much
they look like Robert's.

23:37.662 --> 23:39.329
!
- Yeah, he's awake.

23:39.329 --> 23:40.995
Daddy!

23:40.995 --> 23:43.995
Oh, Daddy!
Oh, my God!

23:43.995 --> 23:46.662
I'm here for you now.
Oh, gosh!

23:46.662 --> 23:48.495
Everything's
gonna be okay.

23:48.495 --> 23:51.621
- Hi!

23:51.621 --> 23:53.829
I'm gonna go
to the washroom.

23:53.829 --> 23:55.370
Cathy, Cathy, I think
we should be probably

23:55.370 --> 23:57.787
- mindful of these cords.
- I'm mindful.

23:57.787 --> 24:00.621
- Well, I want these
to do their job.
- You look so good.

24:00.621 --> 24:03.871
- There's no slack and I think
they're keeping him alive.
- Robert: Fuck!

24:03.871 --> 24:05.370
- Oh!
- Frances:
Oh, my God.

24:05.370 --> 24:08.245
See?
Told you.

24:08.245 --> 24:10.120
So we're gonna
get you out of here.

24:10.120 --> 24:11.746
I'll make you
a nice, home-cooked meal,
won't that be nice?

24:11.746 --> 24:13.370
Mm-hmm.

24:13.370 --> 24:16.621
Uh, I'm gonna go get
some ice for my knuckles.

24:16.621 --> 24:19.579
- No, I'll get--
I'll get your ice.
- I got you premium cable.

24:19.579 --> 24:21.370
- Hey, Cathy.
- 146 channels.

24:21.370 --> 24:23.537
Cathy,
can I grab you?

24:23.537 --> 24:25.495
What do you want?
I gotta get back in there.

24:25.495 --> 24:27.370
And let him get
his own ice, by the way.

24:27.370 --> 24:29.704
It's his fault.
He's such a cement head.

24:29.704 --> 24:32.621
- Ugh!
- I'm sorry,
this is awkward.

24:32.621 --> 24:35.120
- I don't know, really...
- Well, just...

24:35.120 --> 24:36.579
...where to begin, um.

24:38.662 --> 24:41.454
- Robert is not
a perfect individual.

24:41.454 --> 24:44.621
- Oh, come on,
that's putting it mildly.
- Well, none of us are.

24:44.621 --> 24:47.454
- Uh-huh.
- Yet by any
measurable comparison,

24:47.454 --> 24:50.579
he is a far better person
than you are.

24:50.579 --> 24:52.370
- By a mile.

24:52.370 --> 24:54.203
Yeah, by an ocean.

24:54.203 --> 24:56.621
Because you are...

24:58.078 --> 25:00.912
you are a horrible
person, Cathy!

25:00.912 --> 25:03.662
- You don't even know me.
- No, you aren't a good sister,

25:03.662 --> 25:05.162
you aren't
a good daughter.

25:05.162 --> 25:07.162
You are indefensible,

25:07.162 --> 25:11.412
and I will no longer
feel sorry for your wiring

25:11.412 --> 25:16.120
or whatever genetic bugs
you have in your head
or up your ass.

25:16.120 --> 25:17.370
So I'm gonna
tell you something,

25:17.370 --> 25:18.662
and I want you
to listen, okay?

25:18.662 --> 25:20.704
- I'm listening.
- Robert and I may live

25:20.704 --> 25:24.579
on opposite ends
of the planet,

25:24.579 --> 25:28.579
but if I ever hear

25:28.579 --> 25:30.537
that you have
upset him

25:30.537 --> 25:34.787
or that you have caused him
any form of distress,

25:34.787 --> 25:37.787
I will
hunt you down.

25:37.787 --> 25:40.203
So don't fuck
with me, Cathy.

25:40.203 --> 25:43.953
- I think you were
really out of line.
- Cathy.

25:43.953 --> 25:48.912
For once in your life,
just don't say anything.

25:50.162 --> 25:53.329
This is heartbreaking.
Heartbreaking.

25:53.329 --> 25:55.454
Oh, oh, oh,
wait, wait, wait,
I'm sorry, one more thing.

25:55.454 --> 25:59.912
Your mother gave me
the green Fiestaware pitcher,

25:59.912 --> 26:04.287
and you will have to
dig it out of my grave.

26:12.287 --> 26:14.787
So you have food
you can heat up later.

26:14.787 --> 26:17.787
Yeah, it's one
of the things I wanna do
before I leave town,

26:17.787 --> 26:19.370
get him
a new microwave.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.995
This one's
totally shot.

26:21.995 --> 26:24.787
But he is
absolutely married

26:24.787 --> 26:26.995
to that dedicated
popcorn button.

26:26.995 --> 26:29.995
They did a good job
on your hand.

26:29.995 --> 26:33.370
It was very clever
to punch a wall
at a hospital.

26:33.370 --> 26:35.704
- I'm a thinker.

26:35.704 --> 26:38.454
I'm so glad
he's better.

26:40.662 --> 26:43.912
- We got a lot done today.
- We sure did.

26:45.746 --> 26:47.621

30:10.704 --> 30:11.995
Ever since we slept
together in Ohio,

things are uncomplicated.

30:13.037 --> 30:14.953
Sex that makes things
less complicated?

30:14.953 --> 30:16.287
I hear about that a lot.

30:16.995 --> 30:18.203
Lila's thirteen.

30:18.203 --> 30:20.829
It's your first family gathering
since the divorce.

30:20.829 --> 30:22.245
How are you two getting along?

30:23.120 --> 30:25.871
FRANCES DUFRESNE: I pulled
our son over, driving that.

30:25.871 --> 30:27.120
How do you have a Tesla?

30:27.120 --> 30:31.162
-It's my... friend-woman's.

30:32.995 --> 30:35.245
It's a hostile takeover
of my friends.

30:35.245 --> 30:36.746
I suppose she's attractive?

30:36.746 --> 30:38.120
Beachy hair, blonde...

30:38.120 --> 30:40.245
Get this.
She calls him "Robbie."

30:40.245 --> 30:41.871
FRANCES:
My God. Who is this woman?
