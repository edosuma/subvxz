09:38.709 --> 09:40.333
and the dangers of cobalt poisoning.

09:40.417 --> 09:41.333
People need to know the risks.

09:41.417 --> 09:45.667
My reputation, Jackson--
It's everything I had.

09:45.834 --> 09:47.250
And it's still intact, all right?

09:47.333 --> 09:50.041
You have a legendary career. You got sick.

09:50.125 --> 09:53.417
It's tempting to want to point
to my illness and say,

09:53.500 --> 09:55.750
"That's why he made so many mistakes."

09:55.834 --> 09:58.834
But rigorous honesty
is a tenet of my sobriety,

09:58.917 --> 10:00.834
and if I look at myself in the mirror,

10:00.917 --> 10:04.208
I know there were things
that were not the cobalt.

10:04.291 --> 10:05.583
They were just me.

10:05.667 --> 10:07.417
Look, I told Maggie

10:07.542 --> 10:09.208
she should operate on her cousin.

10:09.375 --> 10:10.834
That was a tough call.
In that circumstance,

10:10.917 --> 10:12.208
I might have made the same decision.

10:12.500 --> 10:15.166
And I spent time with a woman
who wasn't your mother.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.959
I knew it was wrong, and I did it anyway,

10:19.750 --> 10:22.959
all because she... puffed up my ego.

10:23.625 --> 10:25.583
It wasn't physical. I made sure of that.

10:26.166 --> 10:27.375
But, still, it--

10:28.792 --> 10:30.125
it felt like cheating.

10:31.667 --> 10:34.000
And I have no one to blame but myself.

10:34.083 --> 10:35.333
[cellphone chimes]

10:36.625 --> 10:37.750
Ah, my patient.

10:37.875 --> 10:40.750
Ah, you-- you go.

10:48.709 --> 10:52.458
[indistinct talking on television]

10:52.542 --> 10:55.959
School is done, and the kids
are watching a movie.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.583
All three of them? How'd you swing that?

10:59.959 --> 11:02.500
I told them it's what you wanted
for your re-birthday.

11:02.583 --> 11:06.667
[sighs] I missed the real one,
so now it's today. Surprise!

11:06.750 --> 11:08.417
Amelia, you don't have to...

11:08.500 --> 11:10.750
Do you realize what I have done?

11:11.667 --> 11:14.083
When was the last time
every child in this house

11:14.166 --> 11:17.083
was doing something
that did not involve us?

11:17.166 --> 11:18.375
And the baby's asleep.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.166
The baby has a name.

11:25.041 --> 11:27.834
But... I just forgot it.

11:27.959 --> 11:29.834
[television continues]

11:29.917 --> 11:31.834
[baby cooing]

11:31.917 --> 11:33.291
[Link] Mikey.

11:33.375 --> 11:35.291
[baby cooing]

11:35.375 --> 11:36.250
Evan.

11:38.417 --> 11:39.375
Toby.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.125
What are you doing?

11:41.750 --> 11:43.875
Oh, uh, I figured

11:43.959 --> 11:46.083
if we couldn't pick a name,

11:46.792 --> 11:48.166
he could pick his own.

11:48.250 --> 11:51.250
Maybe he'll react
when I say the right one.

11:51.709 --> 11:54.542
Hmm? And I can't think of a better idea.

11:55.583 --> 11:56.458
Mark.

11:57.125 --> 11:59.375
[laughs]

11:59.458 --> 12:00.333
Gabriel.

12:00.417 --> 12:01.834
No, no, no, not that one.

12:02.542 --> 12:04.417
-Gabe Lincoln?
-Oh, God.

12:05.625 --> 12:06.959
Maybe we should try some girl names.

12:07.041 --> 12:08.667
We don't know if he'll identify as male.

12:08.750 --> 12:09.625
Good point.

12:10.208 --> 12:11.166
Kimberly.

12:14.083 --> 12:16.542
[monitor beeping]

12:17.500 --> 12:20.500
This kid's dad attacked another kid's dad,

12:20.583 --> 12:22.458
somehow Bailey's foot got involved,

12:22.542 --> 12:24.000
and now they're all in the ER.

12:24.291 --> 12:28.250
Well, I'm OK with that as long
as no one's dying of the plague.

12:28.333 --> 12:30.625
DeLuca's wondering if there's
an update for the dad.

12:31.291 --> 12:33.291
I mean, his blood pressure's
barely holding,

12:33.375 --> 12:36.917
and his burns are extensive,
so it's a long road.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.500
Oh, wow.

12:41.250 --> 12:44.000
These burns have gone through
the muscle, into his chest?

12:44.083 --> 12:45.333
Wait, you're touching his lung?

12:45.417 --> 12:46.709
Have cardio meet us in the OR.

12:46.792 --> 12:48.083
Get a thoracotomy tray ready right away.

12:48.166 --> 12:49.291
I'm on it.

12:51.333 --> 12:53.500
[siren wailing in distance]

13:05.458 --> 13:07.667
[sighs, sniffs]

13:07.750 --> 13:09.500
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.792
Look, I-I don't know
when I'm gonna get another quiet moment,

13:11.875 --> 13:13.208
so do you want to talk now?

13:13.291 --> 13:15.667
Uh, yeah, sure. That's a good idea.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.792
There hasn't really been
much time to think lately.

13:17.875 --> 13:19.917
But what little time
there has been, I've been--

13:21.667 --> 13:22.959
I've been thinking about the future

13:24.208 --> 13:25.375
and <i>our </i>future.

13:26.125 --> 13:27.250
Yeah, me, too.

13:29.166 --> 13:31.667
So I took a look at my medical
directives and my will.

13:32.834 --> 13:35.709
And if anything happened to me,

13:35.792 --> 13:37.166
obviously, you'd get Allison,

13:37.250 --> 13:38.959
uh, but we haven't made a plan for Leo.

13:39.041 --> 13:40.208
-[clears throat]
-Owen, I want to talk about us.

13:40.291 --> 13:42.291
And I haven't talked to Amelia
and Link about this...

13:42.375 --> 13:43.875
I wanna talk about you and me.

13:43.959 --> 13:45.542
...but if you-- if you can't,
then maybe they'd be willing--

13:45.625 --> 13:47.041
[cellphone vibrates, chimes]

13:47.125 --> 13:49.041
-At least then, the kids would--
-[cellphone vibrates, chimes]

13:49.125 --> 13:50.291
You-- You need to get that?

13:50.583 --> 13:51.959
Yeah. I-I'm sorry. I, um--

13:52.041 --> 13:55.041
Um, yeah. The OR needs me now.

13:55.250 --> 13:56.375
Yeah. OK.

13:56.458 --> 13:59.333
Owen, look. Leo and Allison,
they're brother and sister.

13:59.417 --> 14:01.125
I w-- I-I don't want to split them up.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.375
Of course not. I don't, either.

14:02.458 --> 14:03.667
And if you're OK with them both--

14:03.750 --> 14:06.959
[scoffs] I'm not OK
with you dying, Owen.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.291
Let's talk later, then.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.125
[Meredith] Hey, hey, Hayes!
I got your page.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.458
-Please tell me it's a surgery.
-It's surgery.

14:23.542 --> 14:25.375
Oh, good, 'cause I can't
call time of death

14:25.458 --> 14:26.917
on one more person.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.750
And I don't want it
to be someone's grandmother.

14:28.834 --> 14:30.834
Oh, you'd prefer it was a teenager?

14:30.917 --> 14:32.834
Well, no, no. That came out wrong.

14:32.917 --> 14:34.166
I just want to do what I'm best at,

14:34.250 --> 14:35.792
and cutting people open
is what I'm best at,

14:35.875 --> 14:37.709
-and what do we have?
-Frankie Morris.

14:37.792 --> 14:40.125
Eight weeks ago, I helped
give him a transplanted kidney

14:40.208 --> 14:41.542
for ARPKD.

14:41.625 --> 14:43.041
It was behaving beautifully

14:43.125 --> 14:45.166
till a tree branch
penetrated it earlier today.

14:45.458 --> 14:47.000
Injured the superior pole.

14:47.083 --> 14:48.917
-Tree branch?
-He was running from a wildfire.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.500
-What do you think?
-I think I'm saving a kidney!

14:54.875 --> 14:56.166
-You coming?
-Well, I wouldn't mind,

14:56.250 --> 14:57.792
considering it's my patient.

14:58.250 --> 14:59.667
Stay out of my way.

14:59.750 --> 15:00.834
Uh-huh.

15:03.166 --> 15:04.208
[Levi] How does this feel?

15:04.291 --> 15:06.166
T-T-- It feels like
you put on a tourniquet,

15:06.250 --> 15:08.667
and all my blood flow has stopped. T-- Ah!

15:08.750 --> 15:12.709
All right. Uh, we got some soft
tissue swelling but no fracture.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.792
You'll be as good as new
in a few days if you stay off it.

15:15.083 --> 15:16.750
-Oh.
-Great. Just like I thought.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.291
[sighs]

15:20.041 --> 15:21.458
[Richard] Ah.

15:21.542 --> 15:22.583
Well, what happened here?

15:22.667 --> 15:25.792
There was a fistfight
between some parents.

15:25.875 --> 15:26.917
You start it?

15:27.583 --> 15:29.041
I live in a hotel.

15:29.125 --> 15:31.166
My sister-in-law takes care of my boys.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.375
I only get to see my husband

15:32.458 --> 15:35.417
when he comes here
to clap for me every 12 hours,

15:35.542 --> 15:38.375
and two grown men just used me
as a wrestling mat.

15:38.458 --> 15:40.125
-You're not funny.
-[knock on door]

15:40.208 --> 15:41.583
Dr. Fox is ready for you, Chief.

15:41.750 --> 15:42.917
-Ugh.
-Ohh.

15:42.959 --> 15:44.375
Should I tell her to wait?

15:44.542 --> 15:46.917
And if so, can someone else?
Because I am not her favorite.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.125
-[Levi] So conference room?
-[sighs]

15:49.208 --> 15:51.333
No. Cancun.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.709
See? That was funny.

15:53.792 --> 15:54.709
Chief Bailey?

15:54.792 --> 15:56.875
T-- Uh, tell her I'll be there soon.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.041
Ugh.

16:03.417 --> 16:05.250
[Jackson] <i>Rigorous honesty, right?</i>

16:05.333 --> 16:08.959
I am here to be
rigorously honest with you.

16:09.041 --> 16:10.542
No, not right now, thank you.

16:10.625 --> 16:11.792
I'm gonna tell you my truth,
and you're gonna listen,

16:11.875 --> 16:13.875
whether you like it or not,
because you're bed-bound

16:13.959 --> 16:15.083
and I'm not.

16:17.333 --> 16:19.375
I know it's really hard
to live with my mom.

16:20.417 --> 16:21.750
I know she can be withholding

16:21.834 --> 16:24.083
when she's angry or feels slighted.

16:25.542 --> 16:27.250
And I remember.
I know she didn't say anything

16:27.333 --> 16:28.750
when Bailey fired you.

16:29.375 --> 16:30.750
I have been where you are.

16:30.834 --> 16:32.917
I get it. And, yeah, I'm a little pissed

16:33.000 --> 16:34.709
about the whole other-woman thing,

16:34.792 --> 16:36.250
but you know what? A-At my core,

16:36.333 --> 16:38.000
I kind of-- I kind of even get that, too,

16:38.083 --> 16:40.834
because I know that Mom
can push people to need to prove

16:40.917 --> 16:43.458
that she is not the sun, moon,
and stars all rolled into one,

16:43.542 --> 16:45.000
to prove that you're your own man,

16:45.083 --> 16:47.333
to prove that, "Hey, sometimes
you're just plain wrong,"

16:47.417 --> 16:48.542
even if she'll never admit it.

16:48.625 --> 16:50.250
I also get that she kind of <i>is</i>

16:50.333 --> 16:51.959
the sun, moon, and stars
all rolled into one,

16:52.041 --> 16:53.583
especially when she loves you,

16:53.667 --> 16:57.291
'cause when she loves you,
man, she will move mountains

16:57.375 --> 16:58.333
to help you.

16:58.458 --> 17:01.125
She will dedicate herself
totally and completely

17:01.208 --> 17:03.458
to helping you, to getting you
where you need to go,

17:03.542 --> 17:05.792
however you need to get there.

17:06.417 --> 17:08.125
When she loves, it's super hard.

17:08.208 --> 17:11.166
and all of that love--
it's worth the rest of it.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.667
I know you love her. I know you do.

17:12.750 --> 17:13.834
'Cause you're physically better.

17:13.917 --> 17:16.083
The cobalt's pretty much
out of your system by now.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.625
You're still not yourself.
You're not even fighting

17:17.709 --> 17:19.709
for your damn reputation
or your career, Richard,

17:19.792 --> 17:21.834
'cause your wife isn't here.

17:21.917 --> 17:23.625
Why is that? 'Cause you sent her away.

17:24.750 --> 17:26.041
I know with all of my being

17:26.125 --> 17:29.208
that you need to get over this
stubborn ego, stubborn pride,

17:29.333 --> 17:31.625
and go call and claim
the woman that you love,

17:31.709 --> 17:32.667
'cause you're not gonna get over it.

17:33.250 --> 17:35.083
And you're damn sure
never gonna get over her.

17:37.375 --> 17:39.333
You know, I'm not too old
to kick your ass.

17:39.417 --> 17:40.583
[chuckles]

17:44.041 --> 17:45.542
I always wanted a son.

17:45.625 --> 17:47.166
Well, you've got one.

17:47.834 --> 17:51.125
So when she calls you,
just answer the damn phone, OK?

17:51.208 --> 17:52.500
Hear her out.

17:52.583 --> 17:54.208
If you don't want to do it
for yourself, do it for me.

17:55.458 --> 17:56.750
[monitors beeping]

17:56.834 --> 17:59.000
[Jackson] Can I get another
two units of blood on standby?

18:00.417 --> 18:01.291
[Teddy and Maggie]
Got your page.

18:01.375 --> 18:03.041
-[Jackson] Get in here.
-Both of you.

His burns have gone past the chest wall

18:04.750 --> 18:06.291
all the way into the thoracic cavity.

18:06.375 --> 18:08.083
[Maggie] Full-thickness burns
all the way to the lungs?

18:08.166 --> 18:09.291
Have you ever seen anything like that?

18:09.375 --> 18:12.208
[Teddy] Yeah, in a bombing in Iraq.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.291
[Jo] Clamp.

18:24.667 --> 18:25.875
[Link] This feels like...

18:27.709 --> 18:28.542
[chuckles]

18:30.417 --> 18:32.917
I had this friend
in the bike shop in Venice.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.041
Mm-hmm.

18:34.750 --> 18:36.750
And one year, it rained like crazy.

18:38.709 --> 18:40.834
And he said, uh,

18:40.917 --> 18:42.709
there had to be this one moment

18:42.792 --> 18:46.333
when all the windshield wipers
on all the cars in the city

18:46.417 --> 18:50.375
were aligned and in sync
just for one or two wipes.

18:51.291 --> 18:56.709
He called it a fleeting moment
of profound harmony.

18:56.792 --> 18:59.667
Mm. This friend smoke a lot of pot?

18:59.750 --> 19:03.500
Mm. Yeah, he had a medical card
<i>and </i>a dealer.

19:04.750 --> 19:07.166
[baby crying over monitor]

19:08.125 --> 19:10.000
-[groans]
-I got it.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.959
You enjoy

19:12.041 --> 19:16.166
your profound moment of fleeting--

19:16.250 --> 19:17.667
Happy birthday. [sighs]

19:17.750 --> 19:18.917

[continues crying]

19:25.208 --> 19:26.709

19:26.792 --> 19:29.959
This website says some people
pick names from a dream.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.500
What was the last dream you had
before the baby was born?

19:32.583 --> 19:34.542
Um, does it have to be my dream?

19:34.625 --> 19:37.709
Yes, because I don't think
we should call him

19:37.792 --> 19:39.208
Sex with His Dad.

19:40.166 --> 19:42.500
I don't think Snake in a Vest
is much better.

19:42.583 --> 19:43.750
Right.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.041
OK. Let's keep going.

19:45.125 --> 19:46.750
Power through it. Think outside the box.

19:46.834 --> 19:48.542
No wrong answers.
Say some things you love.

19:48.625 --> 19:52.834
Or we could just take a step back...

19:52.917 --> 19:56.125
rest our brains,
revisit the subject when we feel more...

19:57.500 --> 19:58.709
like ourselves?

19:59.291 --> 20:02.709
"Like ourselves" as in
"not hormonal and crazy"?

20:02.792 --> 20:03.667
I mean...

20:05.417 --> 20:06.959
-Yes?
-Go away.

20:07.041 --> 20:08.250
-I-I--
-Get out

20:08.333 --> 20:09.709
before I shoot breast milk in your eyes.

20:11.959 --> 20:14.041
[suction gurgling, monitor beeping]

20:14.125 --> 20:17.000
[Hayes] No one would be able tell
you've been out of the OR for a while.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.625
I recite surgical steps

20:18.709 --> 20:21.000
when I'm putting on my PPE.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.583
I'm claustrophobic, so it calms me down.

20:24.709 --> 20:25.875
How are your lot taking it?

20:25.959 --> 20:27.166
-My kids?
-Mm-hmm.

20:27.250 --> 20:28.583
Well, I haven't been home in two weeks,

20:28.667 --> 20:31.959
so I'm not sure they remember who I am.

20:32.041 --> 20:33.542
My lads are crawling the walls.

20:33.625 --> 20:35.792
I just pray to God they don't
do anything this stupid.

20:35.875 --> 20:37.125
[Meredith]
Gonna tell me when you were this age,

20:37.208 --> 20:39.417
you don't remember being away
from your friends for two days

20:39.500 --> 20:41.083
feeling like an eternity?

20:41.166 --> 20:42.875
Friends, no. Girlfriend, maybe.

20:42.959 --> 20:44.709
I once hoisted myself
over an electric fence

20:44.792 --> 20:45.667
to get to a girlfriend.

20:47.125 --> 20:48.750
What were you doing
behind an electric fence?

20:48.875 --> 20:50.875
Ah, we don't know each other
well enough for that story yet.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.917
All right, Frankie. Moment of truth.

20:56.083 --> 20:57.709
[Meredith]
We'll have to inspect the calyces,

20:57.917 --> 20:59.333
but so far, so good.

21:03.458 --> 21:05.667
Well, what do you know?
Maybe there is another tomorrow.

21:05.750 --> 21:06.750
[chuckles]

21:06.834 --> 21:08.458
[monitors beeping rapidly]

21:08.542 --> 21:09.792
-Damn it.
-Clamp.

21:12.250 --> 21:13.417
Come on, Frankie.

21:13.667 --> 21:14.583
Come on, Frankie.

21:17.333 --> 21:18.834
No, no, no. Ma, Ma,
you got to do the thing

21:18.917 --> 21:20.083
where you pretend that the broccoli

21:20.166 --> 21:22.417
is the brother of the carrots
that he already ate

21:22.500 --> 21:25.250
and that they need to be
reunited in his tummy.

21:25.333 --> 21:29.250
Yeah, like, uh,
"Please, Mr. Leo. Please, please,

21:29.333 --> 21:31.875
let me be reunited
with my sister in your tummy."

21:31.959 --> 21:35.208
OK? OK, good. Yeah, Ma.
I got to go. I love you. Bye.

21:35.291 --> 21:37.291
[Aaron] Excuse me, Doctor.
Uh, my son is Frankie.

21:37.375 --> 21:38.333
Is there any update?

21:39.250 --> 21:40.500
Do they have to take his new kidney out?

21:40.750 --> 21:41.959
Are-- Are we going through this
all over again?

21:42.041 --> 21:43.417
Well, he only just went up to the O.R.,

21:43.500 --> 21:46.625
so it's gonna be a while
before we know, I'm afraid.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.333
You know, when COVID started,
I told Frankie, "Now it's our turn

21:51.417 --> 21:54.250
to protect the doctors
and nurses who helped you,"

21:54.333 --> 21:56.083
and we have been diligent and careful.

21:56.166 --> 21:57.917
We have quarantined, and we have prayed,

21:57.959 --> 22:02.083
and now my own son, my son who is alive

22:02.166 --> 22:05.041
because a good person died
and donated a kidney--

22:05.125 --> 22:09.458
He threw it all away for a party.

22:10.625 --> 22:13.166
[voice breaking] I love my son
more than I love myself,

22:13.250 --> 22:14.750
and I want him to be OK.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.208
[crying] But I am so mad.

22:17.834 --> 22:19.792
I don't know how I'll even
be able to look at him.

22:24.750 --> 22:26.291
[Owen] Schmitt,
check on her post-op H&amp;H

22:26.375 --> 22:28.667
and keep an eye on her urine output, OK?

22:32.917 --> 22:33.875
Owen...

22:34.875 --> 22:36.083
what's going on?

22:37.542 --> 22:39.166
What's wrong? I-- [sighs]

22:40.583 --> 22:41.667
What are you not saying? I know you.

22:41.750 --> 22:44.166
I-I know that there is something wrong.

22:46.667 --> 22:48.834
Do you think maybe
you're projecting, Teddy?

22:48.917 --> 22:51.291
I mean [chuckles] what are <i>you </i>not saying?

22:51.375 --> 22:52.709
What are you not telling <i>me?</i>

22:54.458 --> 22:55.583
I'm right here.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.542
I'm right here, Teddy, and I love you.

23:00.917 --> 23:03.792
And I [sighs] I trust you.

23:05.417 --> 23:07.166
And you're my best friend.

23:07.250 --> 23:08.667
So if there's something...

23:10.250 --> 23:14.291
you need to tell me, now is the time.

23:18.709 --> 23:21.208
No. No, there--
there's nothing. [chuckles]

23:21.917 --> 23:22.750
Nothing.

23:23.375 --> 23:26.208
[inhales deeply]

our wedding day.

23:47.792 --> 23:48.959
[sighs]

23:50.875 --> 23:52.083
So much for love.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.500
So much for friendship.

23:56.583 --> 23:58.208
So much for-- [sniffles]

23:58.750 --> 24:00.875
So much for trust. [chuckles dryly]

24:02.125 --> 24:03.375
-Owen, I--
-So much for us.

24:03.458 --> 24:04.417
-Owen, wait, wait.
-No.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.083
Oh, my God. Wait. Owen.

24:06.166 --> 24:08.542
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

[crying]

24:10.667 --> 24:12.083
Oh, my God.

24:18.125 --> 24:20.667
No. They said he was <i>out </i>of surgery.

24:21.375 --> 24:23.208
There were some complications.

24:23.291 --> 24:26.291
Uh, y-your son's burns were much
deeper than we saw initially,

24:26.375 --> 24:28.375
so they had to take him back in.

24:29.125 --> 24:29.959
Sorry.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.750
Kayden told me about the party

24:33.834 --> 24:35.166
and asked if he could take the car.

24:36.750 --> 24:39.625
And I had this feeling in my gut
like it's not a good idea.

24:40.834 --> 24:41.792
But I figured,

24:43.041 --> 24:44.667
it's just a few kids.

24:44.750 --> 24:45.959
They'll all wear masks.

24:47.583 --> 24:48.709
No one will find out.

he pulled through surgery
like a champ, OK?

27:10.417 --> 27:11.542

27:11.625 --> 27:13.792
OK. We did have to remove
part of his kidney,

27:13.875 --> 27:15.250
but it's still functioning,

27:15.333 --> 27:16.959
so we'll monitor him closely,
but it's promising.

OK. Thank you so much,
Dr. Hayes. Thank you.

we'll set you up with a tablet

to give you the long version?

-End of report.

when he sent you away after his surgery.

29:11.834 --> 29:12.750
So what?

29:12.834 --> 29:15.709
You humiliated him
when you bought his hospital.

29:15.834 --> 29:18.834
You have both done
incredibly hurtful things.

29:18.917 --> 29:22.333
But he is someone who can
help you through this nightmare

more of right now.

if you decide it's too late!

There are people dying!

There are children dying!

29:36.834 --> 29:38.417
But you are still alive.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.125
And I am sorry that I'm yelling right now,

29:40.208 --> 29:42.208
but it really does feel good,

29:42.291 --> 29:43.709
especially when it's the truth!

mind their own business.
