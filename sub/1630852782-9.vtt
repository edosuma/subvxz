I'm a beast with numbers.

00:26.761 --> 00:28.796
<i>I think I got a spot
for you, kid.</i>

00:29.029 --> 00:31.532
- Who the fuck is this?
- It's your son.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.367
I'm not saying
that I have to cross the border

00:33.401 --> 00:34.668
like a fucking mule.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.036
I can do the easy shit.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.505
How was you in science class?

what the fuck it is.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.782
How long you been
in the Flynns' pocket?

00:47.815 --> 00:50.284
My kick's 50 grand
and counting.

00:50.317 --> 00:52.052
You a visionary,
so what would you do different?

00:52.086 --> 00:53.354
This what we on now.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.655
Boom.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.056
And how much it gonna cost us?

00:56.090 --> 00:57.358
Just bullets and bodies.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.160
I never wanted you
to become the story.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.561

- <i>And what's yours?</i>
- <i>I don't know.</i>

01:02.296 --> 01:03.831
But if that means
not running the piece on you

01:04.064 --> 01:05.766
and walking away,
- I'm-
- I'm willing to do that.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.501
I'm a little bit uneasy

01:07.535 --> 01:10.404

you have in our operation.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.440
Don't mistake power for vision.

I'm gonna crush it.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.476
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't happy

fucking alive.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.681

No.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.887
No, no, he...

04:46.920 --> 04:49.590
he told me about Gloria,

04:49.623 --> 04:50.824
about you.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.426
What about me?

04:53.861 --> 04:56.697
That you wanted her gone.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.700
I know you never liked her,
but this?

04:59.733 --> 05:00.734
What?

05:01.969 --> 05:05.406
You think I would
put you through this torture?

05:06.674 --> 05:09.343
See you sit there
with your heart ripped apart?

05:10.878 --> 05:13.614
Don't you think
it makes more sense

05:13.647 --> 05:16.483
for him to break you

05:16.517 --> 05:18.619
to make me weak?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.721
Shot at my heart

05:20.754 --> 05:23.490
by killing my only son
in the fucking street?

05:25.526 --> 05:26.927
What about Gloria?

05:28.729 --> 05:31.398
What was her crime
in this, huh?

05:31.432 --> 05:33.033
Choosing you over him?

05:35.569 --> 05:38.072
She's fucking dead, Da.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.840
She's gone.

Every fucking one of 'em.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.629
Every fucking one of them.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.635
Got you another load.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.037
There we go.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.041
And there's more on the way.

06:49.643 --> 06:53.480
Hey, yo, some of these bills
smell real bad.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.849
It really makes me wonder, like,

06:55.883 --> 06:58.685
what kind of freaky shit
people be doing with these?

06:58.719 --> 07:00.420
Smell like profit to me.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.790
Hey, you wanna know something
about a $100 bill?

07:02.823 --> 07:06.727

than a public toilet seat.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.830
Think about that shit.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.598
How about I don't?

07:12.599 --> 07:13.934
How we looking?

07:13.967 --> 07:16.069
Adding in
what you just dropped,

07:16.103 --> 07:18.438
we over 18% from yesterday.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.774
<i>Eighteen?</i>

07:20.808 --> 07:22.509
That the real number, or you
just dumbing that shit down

07:22.543 --> 07:23.811
'cause you don't wanna
show off?

07:24.878 --> 07:28.782
All right, fine,
we over 18.245%.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.818
See, that's the shit
I'm talking about!

07:30.851 --> 07:33.053
Flex that beautiful mind.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.522
You ain't gotta be
all humble and shit.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.592
You, like, the smartest kid
I ever seen.

07:39.893 --> 07:40.961
<i>You know,
I used to know somebody</i>

07:40.994 --> 07:43.096
like you, though, once.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.098
Yeah, he could do figures
in his head.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.900
Always buried in a book.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.735
Word. What he do?

07:48.769 --> 07:50.537
Same shit I do.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.705
Now he dead.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.509
But that's this game, ain't it?

07:55.542 --> 07:57.077
Don't matter how smart you are.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.512
Don't matter how safe
you play it.

07:58.545 --> 08:01.181
One day,
your number just come up.

08:01.215 --> 08:03.217
I feel you.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.519
Hey, but I'm
from the streets, man.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.822
Fuck else am I supposed
to be doing?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.925
Anything else.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.861
I'm just saying, you young.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.796
You got time to do something,

08:15.829 --> 08:17.898
something that don't end
with a bullet.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.919
You all right?

08:38.952 --> 08:40.087
Yeah.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.824
It's just...

08:45.559 --> 08:49.129
...even though
I didn't know her that well,

08:49.162 --> 08:50.964
her dying just--

08:53.267 --> 08:56.169
It's another piece of me
I don't have.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.739
Miriam was a good woman.

08:59.907 --> 09:02.609
Lousy cook...

09:02.643 --> 09:04.211
...but sweet as sugar.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.780
I called her...

09:06.813 --> 09:08.148
Kate.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.684
<i>I was wondering
when that was gonna happen.</i>

09:10.717 --> 09:12.586
What did she say?

09:13.687 --> 09:15.622
Not much.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.191
I told her who I was

09:18.225 --> 09:20.794
and that Miriam died.

09:20.827 --> 09:22.696
Then I hung up.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.165
- That's it?
- Yep.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.936
What were you hoping she'd say?

09:30.837 --> 09:32.105
I don't know.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.976
That not a day has gone by

09:36.009 --> 09:38.712
she hasn't thought about me.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.984
But I-I know
that's some bullshit.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.821
Could also be the truth.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.727
<i>You know,
hearing her voice, it...</i>

09:53.760 --> 09:56.296
it wasn't any kind
of magic bullet.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.766
I thought it would be.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.769
She ain't gonna have
what you're looking for, son.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.806
I don't know.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.777
All I know is one thing
for sure.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.814
<i>I'm gonna do whatever it takes</i>

10:13.847 --> 10:16.917
to find Darnell

10:16.950 --> 10:19.052
and be in his goddamn life.

10:30.364 --> 10:32.199
- Yo, yo.
- <i>Hey.</i>

10:34.201 --> 10:35.402
You okay?

10:35.635 --> 10:36.803
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.305
You look like shit.

10:38.338 --> 10:41.074
I just got some o--
it-it don't matter.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.676
Mm-hmm.

10:42.709 --> 10:43.877
I'm very in tune with shit.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.145
I'm good!

10:45.912 --> 10:47.881
Okay.

10:47.914 --> 10:50.117
And we on the clock.
We got Danny Yang waiting.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.119
All right, I'll roll up north
and make the Dahlia drop.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.755
Dropping Dahlia
in Walter's front yard

10:54.788 --> 10:56.123
is gonna knock his head
all the way back.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.257
Yup.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.825
You want me to roll
up there with you?

10:58.859 --> 11:00.994
Nah, I'm good.
I'll link up after.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.062
That's sweet, though.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.163
I really appreciate
you looking out.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.798
Well, I got you.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.068
- What?
- Wanna hug or what?

11:08.101 --> 11:09.936
Could you stop that?

11:09.970 --> 11:11.071
What's the latest
with the princess

11:11.104 --> 11:12.372
and her high-end product?

11:12.406 --> 11:14.975
She should be dropping it off
right about...

12:20.440 --> 12:22.209
Yeah, Da, I'm busy, so--

12:22.242 --> 12:24.244
<i>Victor's been shot.
Come home.</i>

12:26.947 --> 12:28.115
Get out.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.151
Get the fuck out!

12:31.184 --> 12:32.919
Go!

12:44.297 --> 12:45.932
How's he doing?

12:48.468 --> 12:50.003
He's pretty banged up.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.373
Poor boy.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.843
He's in shock, and...

12:56.877 --> 12:58.278
<i>he was covered
in Gloria's blood</i>

12:58.311 --> 13:00.313
<i>by the time
the ambulance got there.</i>

13:00.347 --> 13:01.481
Jesus.

13:01.515 --> 13:04.050
<i>And poor Gloria
didn't make it.</i>

13:06.186 --> 13:07.320
So I thought
I'd bring him out here,

13:07.354 --> 13:09.222
you know,
a little change of scenery.

13:09.256 --> 13:12.058
Can't believe Gloria's dead.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.461
It's a fucking tragedy.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.966
He really loved her, Da.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.902
I know that.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.841
Listen.

13:29.843 --> 13:33.046
You need to tell him
that we're here for him

13:33.079 --> 13:35.015
and we're a family.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.918
We'll always come together
no matter what.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.252
You tell him that.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.820
Yeah.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.157
That's us.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.203
The fucking Serbs.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.342
Da said Tommy Egan
is behind the whole thing.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.110
Tommy?

14:05.512 --> 14:06.880
That doesn't make any sense.

14:06.913 --> 14:09.082
He was sleeping with Gloria.

14:09.115 --> 14:11.885
Yeah, but you said that ended.

14:11.918 --> 14:14.221
I mean, if--

14:14.254 --> 14:17.357
why does he have any reason
to kill either of you?

14:17.390 --> 14:19.993
He never respected me.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.462
Uh, he figured
if he couldn't have her,

14:22.495 --> 14:24.464
no one should.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.934
I don't know him that well, but...

14:27.968 --> 14:29.035
that doesn't sound like him.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.303
Whether you fucking know him
or not,

14:30.337 --> 14:32.205
men are irrational
when it comes to this shit.

14:34.274 --> 14:37.577
Still, he's smart, strategic.

14:37.611 --> 14:38.945
If he wanted you dead,

14:38.979 --> 14:40.614
there are easier ways
to get there.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.616
Whose fucking side are you on?

14:45.418 --> 14:46.419
Yours.

14:47.954 --> 14:50.123
He came to see me yesterday...

14:52.259 --> 14:53.460
...before Glo and I
got on the road.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.961
You know what he told me?

14:56.630 --> 14:59.366
He told me that Da
was putting a hit out on Glo.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.602
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Nope.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.337
Gave me the keys
to a decoy car.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.505
He told me to take back roads

15:05.538 --> 15:07.507
before I made it
out of Illinois.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.975
- So did you?
- Fuck no.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.011
I don't trust him.
I took my own fucking car.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.078
And got hit.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.480
Like you said, he's smart.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.349
He would have covered
his fucking bases.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.953
I don't know, Vic.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.289
That seems like a long reach.

15:22.322 --> 15:23.456
You know, at the very least,

15:23.490 --> 15:25.425
he tipped 'em off
that we were leaving.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.426
Maybe.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.961
How else would they have known?

15:27.994 --> 15:29.296
You didn't even know
we were going.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.498
<i>What'd I miss?</i>

15:37.003 --> 15:39.005
Claud doesn't buy
that Tommy set it up.

15:41.441 --> 15:45.312
I just think if he wanted
Vic dead, he would have...

15:45.345 --> 15:47.514
Ah.

15:47.547 --> 15:50.216
Tommy's too smart
to get his hands dirty.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.952
Much cleaner to bring
the Serbs in to execute it

15:52.986 --> 15:55.288
while he hides in the shadows.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.423
That's his game.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.425
Yeah, I don't know.

16:01.094 --> 16:05.198
This is not the time
to be sitting on the fence.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.033
We're at war here.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.536
The attack on your brother
and Gloria

16:09.569 --> 16:11.738
<i>has put all this in motion.</i>

16:11.971 --> 16:14.441
<i>Now this is about honor, loyalty.</i>

16:15.575 --> 16:17.410
You're a Flynn,

16:17.444 --> 16:19.346
and that should mean something
to you.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.147
It does.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.083
<i>Then it's
an easy decision, then.</i>

16:23.983 --> 16:27.320
You're either with us...

16:27.354 --> 16:29.289
or you're against us.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.167
- <i>Tommy.</i>
- Yeah, I'm coming.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.109
Vic Flynn was ambushed
last night.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.112
He make it through?

16:52.145 --> 16:54.547
Word on the street was,
maybe he didn't survive.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.316
Fuck!

16:56.349 --> 16:57.684
But I know this girl
who works the reception

16:57.717 --> 16:59.519
at the ER, Nina.

16:59.552 --> 17:00.754
She a close talker.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.256
She's always whispering,
which is fucking annoying.

17:03.289 --> 17:04.290
What'd she say?

17:05.091 --> 17:06.226
Vic's alive.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.128
You could have
fucking started with that.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.330
Oh, my God,
you finally went shopping.

17:11.464 --> 17:12.699
Yo, this is my favorite.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.300
Decoration, not nutrition.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.503
Why was people
thinking that Vic was dead?

17:16.536 --> 17:18.171
The car was totaled.
It was shot to hell.

17:19.205 --> 17:22.642
His girlfriend, Gloria,
was she with him?

17:22.675 --> 17:24.511
Nah, Nina didn't say
anything about a girl.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.581
Oh. How well you know her?

17:28.615 --> 17:31.317
- We was kind of kicking it.
- Oh.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.153
So you was sleeping
with Vic Flynn's girl?

17:33.186 --> 17:35.188
For a minute, but it--

17:35.221 --> 17:37.090
Why you think she was with him?

17:37.123 --> 17:39.092
'Cause I was the one
that was trying to save them.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.193
From what?

17:40.226 --> 17:41.661
Rumor is, it's the Serbs
that got them.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.229
The Serbs?

17:43.263 --> 17:45.365
Nah, I don't think so.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.741
Bye, Da.
I'll check in later, okay?

17:54.774 --> 17:56.743
Hey, hey, hold on a sec,
would you?

17:58.278 --> 17:59.345
What's up?

17:59.379 --> 18:01.314
You want coffee?

18:01.347 --> 18:02.549
I'm good.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.521
I'm gonna be putting together
a war room.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.090
And you're telling me this why?

18:11.124 --> 18:13.126
Because I want you there.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.462
Really?

18:15.495 --> 18:17.597
You've made it a point
my whole life to exclude me

18:17.630 --> 18:19.232
from this side of the business.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.168
What changed?

18:22.202 --> 18:25.305
Almost losing my son twice.

18:27.373 --> 18:29.576
It made me realize

18:29.609 --> 18:32.545
how much you both mean to me and...

18:32.579 --> 18:34.681
how I need you by my side.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.650
<i>It's hard to shake off
a lifetime</i>

18:37.684 --> 18:39.619
<i>of seeing the world
a certain way.</i>

18:41.120 --> 18:45.158
But I promise you I'm gonna try

18:45.191 --> 18:46.693
if you'll please let me.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.833
I need you, bunny.

18:56.870 --> 18:58.538
That's all I ever wanted, Da.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.214
There's just one thing

19:08.248 --> 19:09.916
that I need you to do for me.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.719
What's that?

19:12.752 --> 19:15.288
Keep an eye on your brother.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.892
Do not let him
anywhere near Egan ever.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.161
You got it.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.531
The last thing we need
is Victor going after him.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.167
We're gonna kill Egan

19:28.201 --> 19:30.937
and every one of those
motherfucking Serbs.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.673
But we gotta do it smart.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.310
Understood.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.711
I'll stay close. I promise.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.616
Go ahead. Take your call.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.289
No, it's okay.

19:51.724 --> 19:52.892
The only people
who matter to me

19:52.926 --> 19:54.694
are in this house right now.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.697
No one else exists.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.732
That's my girl.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.869
I love you, darling.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.672
Love you too.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.851
Hey, boy.

20:18.885 --> 20:19.953
Cup of coffee.

20:21.854 --> 20:22.989
Jesus.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.259
How'd you sleep?

20:26.292 --> 20:27.393
I didn't.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.666
I know we've been
through our shit...

20:35.435 --> 20:37.370
...but I wanna put that
behind us.

20:45.311 --> 20:47.313
Good.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.682
'Cause blood...

20:49.716 --> 20:51.918
blood's everything.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.653
All these fools
you got around you,

20:53.686 --> 20:55.688
saying they're loyal,

20:55.722 --> 20:57.624
fuck them.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.959
They'll all scatter
in a fucking heartbeat.

20:59.993 --> 21:02.528
Family always have your back.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.665
That's true.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.735
I'll always forgive
your transgressions...

21:10.603 --> 21:13.406
...welcome you home
with open fucking arms.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.542
I don't suppose
it's lost on you,

21:16.576 --> 21:18.544
if you hadn't tried to leave,

21:18.578 --> 21:20.446
Gloria would still be alive.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.349
I know.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.785
But those...

21:25.818 --> 21:27.553
were choices you made as a boy.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.791
And now you're gonna learn

21:31.824 --> 21:34.027
how to make moves
as a real man.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.369
How's he doing?

21:43.403 --> 21:45.972
Oh, he's fucking peachy.
What do you think?

21:48.341 --> 21:49.676
Don't worry about my boy.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.512
He'll pull through this shit.
He's a Flynn.

21:54.047 --> 21:56.416
- He really loved that girl.
- Whatever.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.420
For someone whose son
almost died last night,

22:00.453 --> 22:02.388
you got
a real swing in your step.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.757
Well, family's reunited,

22:04.791 --> 22:07.560
and now Victor has finally got
his priorities right.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.863
We can get some proper justice.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.367
You hit the Serbs again, Walter,

22:14.400 --> 22:16.569
it's gonna mean
an all-out fucking war.

22:16.602 --> 22:20.640
I'm gonna fucking annihilate
the Serbs and Tommy Egan.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.908
Fuck's Egan got
to do with this?

22:21.941 --> 22:23.676
He set us up.

22:23.710 --> 22:25.945
Egan would have put a bullet
in Vic's head way before now

22:25.978 --> 22:27.013
if that's what he wanted.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.915
Like I said,

22:28.948 --> 22:31.984
we're taking out Egan
and the fucking Serbs.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.887
I want these motherfuckers
eradicated from the Earth.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.122
We don't have the manpower

22:36.355 --> 22:37.757
for that kind
of shit show, Walter.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.726
That's why we're gonna call
the Four Horsemen.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.428
Jesus, Walter.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.665
You wanna maybe think
about this for a minute?

22:48.134 --> 22:51.437
I ain't looking
for a fucking lecture, Paulie.

22:51.471 --> 22:52.905
We're making the call.

23:15.628 --> 23:16.829
<i>The number

Fuck!

24:01.874 --> 24:03.009
You good?

24:04.477 --> 24:05.678
Yeah.

24:05.711 --> 24:07.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:07.513 --> 24:09.182
Just, re-ups is crazy.

24:09.215 --> 24:10.616
This city's
running through Dahlia

24:10.650 --> 24:12.185
faster than we can move it.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.187
Buckle up.
We gonna be here all night.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.189
How's he doing?

24:17.123 --> 24:19.025
Uh, well, there was a little
bit of a learning curve.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.593
Some of the measurements
were off.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.662
But he's in the zone now.

24:22.695 --> 24:23.996
That's good.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.164
'Cause it's payday.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.501
Do not spend it all
at one time.

24:28.534 --> 24:29.969
Or anywhere visible.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.003
And nothing over

24:31.037 --> 24:32.805
- ten Gs in cash.
- Ten Gs in cash.

24:39.545 --> 24:41.914
You doing real good here, JP.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.817
I don't even know how
to thank you for this gig, man.

24:44.851 --> 24:47.787
I'm making real progress
on knocking down my debt.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.055
Well, that's good.

24:49.088 --> 24:50.489
And when you get there,
then you're done here.

24:51.557 --> 24:53.226
Well, why does it have to stop?

24:53.259 --> 24:54.961
Because you have an end number

24:54.994 --> 24:56.529
that we agreed to get you to.

24:56.562 --> 24:58.197
I-I know, but, uh, you know,

24:58.231 --> 24:59.999
if I just had
a little bit more time,

25:00.032 --> 25:02.101
then I can get some
breathing room, a cushion.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.736
- We had a deal.
- I know.

25:03.769 --> 25:05.238
And it-it's a smart setup, Tommy.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.173
- <i>-
- You've thought of everything.</i>

25:07.206 --> 25:08.708
I feel very safe here.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.576
Yeah, until you ain't.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.979
Just keep working
towards that number, and...

25:13.012 --> 25:14.547
and we'll come up
with some new shit.

25:14.580 --> 25:17.216
<i>This is Claudia.
You know what to do.</i>

25:17.250 --> 25:19.552
Motherfucker.

25:29.662 --> 25:32.698
- G, what you fuck is you doing?
- I fucked up.

25:32.732 --> 25:33.933
Oh, you just
realizing that now?

25:33.966 --> 25:35.835
Bro, can you just listen?

25:35.868 --> 25:38.838
Jenard and Blaxton went
to Cousin Buddy without me.

25:40.273 --> 25:41.741
Cut me the fuck out.

25:41.774 --> 25:44.076
Same exact shit you did to me.

25:44.110 --> 25:47.113
I feel real fucked up
about it, bro.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.615
D, you my nigga.

25:51.884 --> 25:54.220
I just...

25:54.253 --> 25:55.788
I just wanna make shit right, bro.

25:56.622 --> 25:57.823
Hell nah, I'm way past
making shit right.

25:57.857 --> 25:58.991
Hold up. Hold up.

26:01.327 --> 26:02.895
Hit me.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.297
I deserve it.

26:05.831 --> 26:08.134
Give me your best, nigga.
Hit me.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.936
I deserve the shit, a'ight?

26:12.305 --> 26:13.572
A'ight.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.148
You a scary-ass nigga, man.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.617
Come here. Come here.

26:24.650 --> 26:25.685
I love you, dog.

26:25.718 --> 26:27.186
You like a brother
to me, a'ight?

26:27.219 --> 26:28.754
You my nigga.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.156
Love you too, D.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.762
So you trying to get back
at CBI or what?

26:37.897 --> 26:39.799
You know I am.

26:39.832 --> 26:40.900
A'ight, look.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.971
Hit Cousin Buddy line,
aight let's go see him.

26:45.004 --> 26:46.706
I got a plan.

26:46.739 --> 26:49.208
So look, check it out.
This how this shit go.

26:55.681 --> 26:57.817
- JP.
- Hey.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.085
Look, I didn't mean
to push before.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.686
I really appreciate this gig.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.254
Oh, no, no, fuck that, man.
It's all good.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.256
Okay, look, Tommy,
I got something to tell you.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.891
Me too.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.293
- Go ahead.
- Oh, okay.

27:09.929 --> 27:12.131
I called Kate.

27:12.164 --> 27:13.332
What?

27:13.366 --> 27:14.867
- Did you tell her where I am?
- No.

27:14.900 --> 27:16.102
What the fuck did you tell her?

27:16.135 --> 27:17.670
Nothing! I just didn't want her

27:17.703 --> 27:19.805
to find out about Miriam
from anybody but me.

27:19.839 --> 27:22.842
I asked you to do one
motherfucking thing for me!

27:22.875 --> 27:24.043
- One!
- I know.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.177
No, you don't!

27:25.211 --> 27:26.178
Otherwise,
you wouldn't have opened up

27:26.212 --> 27:27.346
this fucking box!

27:27.380 --> 27:28.848
You don't know
what the fuck you just did!

27:28.881 --> 27:30.316
I did what I thought was right.

27:30.349 --> 27:32.685
You did what you thought
was right for you!

27:40.893 --> 27:42.428
Change in plan.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.263
I'm gonna need
an extra 50 by Friday.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.299
That's impossible.

27:47.333 --> 27:50.069
Life's unpredictable, Seamus.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.272
You should know that
better than anyone.

27:53.305 --> 27:57.343
I mean, one day, your sister's
this bright-eyed girl,

27:57.376 --> 28:01.047
and next minute...

28:01.080 --> 28:02.381
vegetable.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.786
Vegetables die real quick
when they're not taken care of.

28:06.819 --> 28:10.856
I will get you your money.
I just need more time.

28:13.159 --> 28:16.262
I can pull together 20,
maybe 30 by Friday.

28:18.798 --> 28:21.767
If you don't pay me
in full by Friday,

28:21.801 --> 28:25.004
the entire department
finds out you're on the take,

28:25.037 --> 28:28.207
and sis is shipped off
to state living.

28:29.875 --> 28:33.045
That place
is the eighth circle of hell.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.982
Be a goddamn shame if she
ended up there 'cause of you.

doing this again?

29:38.911 --> 29:41.113
Your stash is in the cabinet
under the sink.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.052
You talk to Claud lately?

29:47.086 --> 29:49.522
Fuck no. Why?

29:49.555 --> 29:51.357
She ghosting me.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.793
- That's some bullshit.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

29:54.827 --> 29:56.562
Yeah, but maybe she's
taking care of her brother.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.197
I don't know.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.332
But we out here making moves
and she ain't hitting me back?

30:00.366 --> 30:01.800
Something's fucked up.

30:01.834 --> 30:04.103
Normally, I'd say
we could find out real quick.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.472
Bring her in,
beat it out of her.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.274
But there might be
a problem with that.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.242
Not if you know how to hide
the bruises.

30:10.276 --> 30:11.277
I'll show you.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.345
I like the way you think.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.917
I'm hearing the Irish mob
is coming into Chicago.

30:17.950 --> 30:19.485
I thought the Flynns
was the Irish mob.

30:19.518 --> 30:22.087
No, I mean the real Irish mob.

30:22.121 --> 30:23.889
Hitters from Dublin.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.291
No shit.

30:25.324 --> 30:28.160
Walter must really believe
those Serbs put the hit on Vic.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.528
It's gonna get fucking ugly.

30:29.562 --> 30:31.931
That's the only way to handle
that kind of shit.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.270
This motherfucking
white boy Tommy.

30:38.304 --> 30:41.140
Nigga, I shoulda known he was
the one moving Dahlia, fuck!

30:41.173 --> 30:43.008
Same motherfucker who sent us
to war with the Serbs

30:43.042 --> 30:44.910
and got our fucking boy
Elijah smoked?

30:44.944 --> 30:46.345
Nigga.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.447
And my motherfucking brother
couldn't see none of that shit?

30:48.480 --> 30:49.481
For real?

31:00.893 --> 31:02.194
I don't get it, man.

31:02.228 --> 31:03.929
I don't know what's got
this nigga head all fucked up

31:03.963 --> 31:05.197
since he been locked up,
but that nigga

31:05.231 --> 31:07.099
can't think straight
when that white boy around.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.035
<i>This man got us out here</i>

31:10.069 --> 31:11.971
<i>playing by his little
dusty-ass rules and shit.</i>

31:12.004 --> 31:14.106
<i>Meanwhile business is collapsing, G,</i>

31:14.139 --> 31:15.641
right in fucking front of us.

31:16.942 --> 31:18.377
So what you wanna do about it?

31:19.545 --> 31:23.549
You and me, we gonna
rally the troops, nigga.

31:23.582 --> 31:24.984
Fuck it.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.518
Get all the Dahlia for ourself.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.621
<i>Shit, you know I'm down.</i>

31:29.989 --> 31:31.290
But Diamond don't seem
like he feel it.

31:31.323 --> 31:34.560
Nigga, fuck my brother, a'ight?

31:34.593 --> 31:36.395
<i>And his motherfucking
bullshit, boy!</i>

31:36.428 --> 31:37.429
I don't give a fuck
about that shit!

31:39.298 --> 31:42.301
When we called you
from New Orleans,

31:42.334 --> 31:44.069
I ain't gonna lie, bro, I knew.

31:44.103 --> 31:45.471
Fuck you knew?

31:46.672 --> 31:48.073
I knew that you
was gonna be the one

31:48.107 --> 31:49.441
to help me overthrow his ass.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.513
So you been sitting on this
for a minute, then, huh?

31:54.546 --> 31:57.182
Oh, you motherfucking right
I been sitting on it.

31:57.216 --> 32:00.486
Look, I been playing
the long game, dog, you know?

32:00.519 --> 32:02.187
I already took a dive,
gave the nigga

32:02.221 --> 32:04.556
his confidence back and shit.

32:04.590 --> 32:06.058
<i>I even gave him
his little fake-ass seat</i>

32:06.091 --> 32:07.693
<i>- back with CBI too.</i>
- <i>Mm.</i>

32:10.029 --> 32:11.664
But you know what, nigga?

32:11.697 --> 32:13.565
Fuck Tommy and fuck Diamond.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.167
<i>He don't want
none of this shit.</i>

32:15.200 --> 32:16.935
<i>He dead to me.</i>

32:16.969 --> 32:18.170
I'm ready to take back
what's mine.

32:18.203 --> 32:19.305
What you want?

32:20.572 --> 32:22.207
I got you.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.189
I ain't know you was up here.

32:37.222 --> 32:40.225
Yeah. I didn't know
y'all was down there.

32:44.997 --> 32:46.665
I went by the pipeline
on my way over.

32:46.699 --> 32:48.634
Things a little slow.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.035
I mean, well, you know,

32:50.069 --> 32:52.571
everybody focused
on Dahlia right now, so...

32:52.604 --> 32:55.107
Yeah, it'll pick back up.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.209
You know,
what I told this nigga.

32:57.242 --> 32:59.745
Yeah, he definitely did.
Said just give it time.

32:59.978 --> 33:04.049
Yeah, over time,
everything get back to normal.

33:05.684 --> 33:08.320
I like that. You feel me?

33:08.354 --> 33:11.223
Over time, everything
can get back to normal.

33:11.256 --> 33:14.393
You a Zen nigga, D. You know?

33:14.426 --> 33:17.129
- Love you, man.
- Hey, love you too, baby bro.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.101
My man.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.580
I wasn't sure
you was gonna let me up.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.081
Why?

33:36.115 --> 33:37.583
<i>You been ignoring my calls.</i>

33:37.616 --> 33:39.051
I've been busy.

33:39.084 --> 33:40.152
Bunch of your father's friends

33:40.185 --> 33:42.421
from the old country
in town, huh?

33:42.454 --> 33:43.722
Anything I should know about?

33:43.756 --> 33:45.657
Yeah, family emergency.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.693
I heard Vic
got hit pretty hard.

33:49.061 --> 33:50.295
How's he doing?

33:50.329 --> 33:52.664
He's banged up, but he's okay.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.633
- Mm.
- <i>He got really lucky.</i>

33:54.666 --> 33:57.669
But you probably
already knew that.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.372
Why the fuck would I know that?

34:00.406 --> 34:02.174
Maybe you set him up.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.743
Tipped off the Serbs
about where he'd be.

34:04.777 --> 34:07.212
I tried to protect Vic.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.115
I tried to save him.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.183
I gave him a car so he could

34:11.216 --> 34:12.284
get the fuck out of town
on the low.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.221
Be honest, Tommy.

34:16.255 --> 34:17.556
You never respected him.

34:17.589 --> 34:20.159
Always saw him
as a little prince.

34:20.192 --> 34:23.595
Me and Vic ain't always see
eye to eye, but...

34:23.629 --> 34:26.265
if I wanted to kill him,
he'd already be dead.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.102
Anyone else with him
when it happened?

34:32.438 --> 34:33.439
Gloria.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.176
And?

34:40.078 --> 34:41.413
She wasn't so lucky.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.654
Who told you I was behind this?

34:51.190 --> 34:52.491
Was it your father?

34:54.226 --> 34:55.327
Answer me.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.265
It doesn't matter.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.705
You might wanna consider
your source.

35:12.711 --> 35:14.713
And you
should watch your back.

35:29.161 --> 35:30.796
<i>Get the fuck inside now.</i>

35:36.168 --> 35:37.803
Lock the door.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.377
Now, you're gonna stay quiet.

35:45.410 --> 35:46.845
Look, I know why you--

35:46.879 --> 35:48.747
All right?

35:50.349 --> 35:52.451
<i>Now, we're gonna do this
nice and easy.</i>

35:53.352 --> 35:55.320
You're gonna give me
what I need,

35:55.354 --> 35:56.755
and maybe you won't die.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.592
Something tells me
even if I do,

36:00.626 --> 36:02.261
there's no guarantees.

36:02.294 --> 36:04.162
Well, shit,
let's roll the dice.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.932
Where's the safe?

36:11.169 --> 36:13.305
Follow me, Seamus.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.374
I'll be right behind you. Go.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.318
<i>Get back. Get the fuck back!</i>

36:27.753 --> 36:29.688
A'ight.

36:29.721 --> 36:30.822
<i>All right.</i>

36:35.561 --> 36:37.462
You're at a tipping point.

36:38.664 --> 36:39.631
I've been there.

36:39.665 --> 36:40.899
You and I

36:40.933 --> 36:44.269
have never been
on the same point on anything.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.738
Different sides of the coin
from day one.

36:46.772 --> 36:48.473
I don't know about that.

36:49.474 --> 36:51.543
Day one, we probably
wanted the same shit.

36:52.778 --> 36:54.580
The same thing
that all young Black boys

36:54.613 --> 36:56.214
want in Chicago.

36:57.449 --> 36:58.517
No?

36:59.618 --> 37:01.853
Can't even remember
what the fuck I wanted.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.596
I know I didn't wanna be
a career criminal.

37:10.629 --> 37:13.465
- But here you are.
- Here we are.

37:16.501 --> 37:20.372
Seems to me that
no matter where we started,

37:20.405 --> 37:21.940
we on the same side now.

37:21.974 --> 37:24.009
I'm here
because of what you did.

37:25.877 --> 37:27.746
That's fair.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.715
And now
I got the white man's knee

37:29.748 --> 37:31.650
on my fucking neck.

37:31.683 --> 37:34.519
Polack cop blackmailing me
because of what you did.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.758
How much you need?

37:40.559 --> 37:41.927
A hundred.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.542
Here's 150.

38:11.523 --> 38:13.625
So you gonna tell me
what happened to your head?

38:17.963 --> 38:20.065
My past kind of
caught up with me.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.771
Is everything okay?

38:25.804 --> 38:28.440
Yeah, yeah.

38:28.473 --> 38:31.543
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

38:32.577 --> 38:33.912
You don't have to talk
about it.

38:35.681 --> 38:36.782
No.

38:39.551 --> 38:40.719
I want to.

38:42.788 --> 38:45.357
It's just, today...

38:46.625 --> 38:49.628
...I saw a side of someone
who I thought I knew.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.733
And now I'm not fucking sure
what to think.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.101
I'm sorry.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.373
You know,
this is gonna sound terrible,

39:01.406 --> 39:03.642
but as a reporter...

39:05.410 --> 39:06.645
...after a while,
you start to expect

39:06.678 --> 39:08.613
to see the worst from everyone.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.750
You talking about me?

39:11.783 --> 39:12.951
No.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.722
Is this what you gonna
write about?

39:17.889 --> 39:20.726
That I'm some kind
of work in progress?

39:22.994 --> 39:24.496
I don't know.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.534
The only thing
I'm clear on right now

39:29.568 --> 39:32.437
is that I'm breaking the first
fucking rule of journalism.

39:32.471 --> 39:33.839
And what is that?

39:35.874 --> 39:37.843
Catching feelings
for your subject.

39:42.013 --> 39:44.816
Is that what they taught you
the first day of school?

39:45.617 --> 39:48.053
No, actually, they teach you
how to spell-check.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.789
Hmm.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.527
That would seem more practical.

39:57.729 --> 39:58.730
Come here.

40:08.673 --> 40:10.909
Hey, I gotta make a call.

40:10.942 --> 40:12.144
Be back in a second.

40:12.177 --> 40:13.612
Sure.

40:21.653 --> 40:23.622
Something tells me
you not here for the cookies.

40:23.655 --> 40:26.458
I'm gonna need to ask you
for something big.

40:26.491 --> 40:27.859
You called in every marker.

40:27.893 --> 40:30.428
Walter Flynn thinks
I tried to take out Vic.

40:30.462 --> 40:32.097
- Did you?
- Hell no!

40:32.130 --> 40:33.832
So you waiting on the blowback.

40:33.865 --> 40:36.568
They bringing in some
heavy hitters from Dublin.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.537
I'm gonna need weapons.
I'm gonna need soldiers.

40:38.570 --> 40:39.604
A lot of them.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.439
We made a move once,
held up our end.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.875
- Diamond, this time, I--
- No.

40:43.909 --> 40:44.876
If I don't got you, I don't--

40:44.910 --> 40:46.511
No!

40:46.545 --> 40:48.980
I'm starting to get used
to being outside.

40:49.014 --> 40:51.550
Now, I know I walk
the razor's edge as is,

40:51.583 --> 40:53.785
but I'm not trying to take
another huge fucking swing.

40:53.819 --> 40:56.154
Now, we lucky we made it out
the last battle.

40:57.856 --> 41:01.159
I'm not going back to prison
for you or nobody.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.896
I figured
it couldn't hurt to ask.

41:07.899 --> 41:08.900
Good luck.

41:20.745 --> 41:22.647
<i>Mirkovic?</i>

41:27.552 --> 41:28.820
What brings you here?

41:34.793 --> 41:36.795
I need an army.

41:36.828 --> 41:39.030
And you need to know
who's coming for you.

41:39.698 --> 41:41.166
It's gonna cost you.

41:41.199 --> 41:42.234
Give me a number.

41:42.267 --> 41:43.902
One point five million.

41:43.935 --> 41:45.170
Done.

41:47.906 --> 41:49.107
Who's coming for me?

41:49.140 --> 41:50.976
Well, you know,

41:51.009 --> 41:52.911
that's gonna cost you.

41:56.715 --> 41:58.049
You will have our full support,

41:58.083 --> 41:59.551
as many men as you want.

42:01.286 --> 42:04.789
Walter Flynn and his hitters
from Dublin.

42:04.823 --> 42:06.558
Mm-hmm.

42:14.032 --> 42:15.734
I'll throw in an extra half mil
if you tell me

42:15.767 --> 42:17.135
who did the hit on Vic Flynn.

42:17.168 --> 42:18.670
Tommy.

42:18.703 --> 42:20.238
The girl who was with him
was innocent.

42:20.272 --> 42:22.207
She didn't deserve to die.

42:23.808 --> 42:25.577
It's not the way
we do business.

42:26.578 --> 42:30.048
Yeah, well,
then we got a deal or not?

42:31.716 --> 42:35.654
I am sorry for your mother.

42:48.233 --> 42:51.036
You know,
when I killed your brother,

42:51.069 --> 42:54.272
I ain't get to see his face
when I shot him in the head.

42:54.306 --> 42:56.641
Fuck you.

42:59.945 --> 43:01.680
I'll be right back
with your money.

43:29.607 --> 43:30.809
Two million dollars.

43:37.015 --> 43:38.216
Excellent.

43:38.249 --> 43:39.918
Now let's get to work.

43:42.721 --> 43:44.723
Hey, coz. What's up, Buddy?

43:44.756 --> 43:46.157
The fuck you boys
come around for?

43:46.191 --> 43:48.727
Whoa, whoa, oh, whoa.

43:48.760 --> 43:49.728
Hey, we just came to talk.

43:49.761 --> 43:51.029
That's all we came to do, coz.

43:51.062 --> 43:52.364
Talk to me for what?

43:52.397 --> 43:53.865
I don't see nothin'
in your hands.

43:53.898 --> 43:56.835
Coz, it's okay.

43:56.868 --> 43:59.204
It's me, Marshall, nigga.

43:59.237 --> 44:00.705
Nigga, you ain't got
no product.

44:00.739 --> 44:02.073
You ain't got nothin'
in your hands.

44:02.107 --> 44:03.675
You little niggas
trying to jam me up?

44:03.708 --> 44:04.876
- Nah.
- I'll smoke y'all

44:04.909 --> 44:06.911
little skinny asses right now.

44:06.945 --> 44:08.146
Kill these motherfuckers, man.

44:08.179 --> 44:09.347
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on. We got product.

44:09.381 --> 44:10.815
The fuck you talking about?

44:10.849 --> 44:13.752
Man, that black magic
powder shit, Dahlia?

44:13.785 --> 44:16.087
We got the connect for you.
Direct line.

44:16.121 --> 44:18.857
Yo, fall back. You in this
little nigga's personal space.

44:21.326 --> 44:23.661
Next one gonna be
in your disobedient ass.

44:25.730 --> 44:29.367
You got balls, Gumby.
I'm already in with Jenard.

44:30.969 --> 44:33.171
Man, fuck them
CBI niggas, a'ight?

44:33.204 --> 44:35.306
Jenard ain't got shit
behind that sample.

44:35.340 --> 44:38.176
If he did,
why he ain't bring more?

44:38.209 --> 44:39.277
Like this.

44:45.717 --> 44:47.385
- Where Jenard at?
- Who fucking cares?

44:47.419 --> 44:48.987
We the connect now.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.890
Look, cozzo, we can get you
however much you want.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.432
You little niggas
making big moves.

45:02.100 --> 45:03.401
Get me four more bricks
by tomorrow

45:03.435 --> 45:05.870
or a sit with your connect,

45:05.904 --> 45:07.272
or I can't trust you.

45:07.305 --> 45:10.408
If I can't trust you...

45:10.442 --> 45:12.177
y'all dead.

45:16.381 --> 45:18.249
Got you, coz.

46:11.503 --> 46:13.138
You're right about Tommy.

46:13.171 --> 46:14.539
I never should have
doubted you.

46:14.772 --> 46:17.775
- What changed your mind?
- I just saw him with Mirkovic.

46:18.476 --> 46:19.878
They're working together.

46:19.911 --> 46:22.447
You were right.
That motherfucker.

46:24.983 --> 46:27.118
What did I tell you?

46:27.152 --> 46:29.220
You two...

46:29.254 --> 46:30.855
you need to trust me.

46:33.091 --> 46:35.260
I'm all in, Da.

46:35.293 --> 46:36.394
Anything you want.

46:37.929 --> 46:40.198
I'll never step away
from this family again.

46:40.231 --> 46:42.567
From here on out, I'll do
whatever you need me to do.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.303
No questions asked.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.282
I need you to lead.

47:02.453 --> 47:05.523
A wise man once said...

47:05.557 --> 47:09.327
"The only true wealth
in this life

47:09.360 --> 47:10.828
"is children.

47:10.862 --> 47:12.530
"More than all the money

47:12.564 --> 47:14.432
or all the power
on this Earth."

47:16.000 --> 47:17.835
I am rich beyond measure.

47:28.279 --> 47:29.447
Fuck, man.

47:29.480 --> 47:33.151
Yo, these slippery
little motherfuckers, man.

47:33.184 --> 47:35.954
D-Mac and Marshall, bro. Fuck!

47:35.987 --> 47:38.323
Fuck they little ass
done got into?

47:38.356 --> 47:40.458
G, these little niggas
done went to Gary

47:40.491 --> 47:43.294
and took a meet with
motherfucking Cousin Buddy.

47:43.328 --> 47:44.929
Yeah.

47:44.963 --> 47:46.364
They ain't got shit
to offer him.

47:47.565 --> 47:49.234
Nigga, peep.

47:49.267 --> 47:52.270
They dropped
a brick of Dahlia off on 'em.

47:52.303 --> 47:55.506
How the fuck
they pull that kind of work?

47:55.540 --> 47:57.442
Nigga, I don't know.

47:57.475 --> 48:00.078
But they offered
this nigga distro

48:00.111 --> 48:01.212
and a meet with the connect.

48:01.246 --> 48:02.280
Hold the fuck up.

48:04.148 --> 48:05.350
Don't none of this
make no sense.

48:05.383 --> 48:08.386
Them little niggas ain't got
no pull, no money.

48:08.419 --> 48:11.456
How the fuck they gon' front
like they got a Dahlia connect?

48:14.392 --> 48:16.661
It was Tommy.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.997
It was motherfucking Tommy.

48:19.030 --> 48:21.032
Yeah, G,

48:21.065 --> 48:24.135
I paid D-Mac
to drop that nigga, right?

48:24.168 --> 48:25.603
And this little motherfucker
came back to me

48:25.637 --> 48:27.405
with my bounty empty-handed.

48:29.907 --> 48:33.111
This little motherfucker
cut us off at the knees, G.

48:34.479 --> 48:36.914
Tommy gotta go.

48:38.249 --> 48:39.584
Indeed.

48:39.617 --> 48:42.353
But we gonna kill
these little niggas first.

48:48.326 --> 48:50.194
- What's up, D-Mac?
- <i>Yo.</i>

48:50.228 --> 48:52.230
Yo, man, come here.
Let me holler at you.

48:52.263 --> 48:53.431
Hey, but wait, let me tell you

48:53.464 --> 48:55.099
what me and Marshall
got going on for you.

48:55.133 --> 48:57.302
Hold up, man.
I-I need to talk to you first.

48:57.335 --> 49:00.438
But wait, we hooked up
Dahlia distro for you in Gary.

49:01.506 --> 49:04.342
- You did what?
- So Marshall got a cousin.

49:04.375 --> 49:05.643
Nigga got one eye.

49:05.677 --> 49:07.545
Well, actually, he got two,
but one's looking east.

49:07.578 --> 49:09.147
The other one's looking west.

49:09.180 --> 49:10.448
What the fuck did you just do?

49:10.481 --> 49:11.549
Wait, I'm trying to tell you.

49:11.582 --> 49:13.484
Look, so me and Marshall
was in the mix

49:13.518 --> 49:15.653
with Jenard
running coke to Gary,

49:15.687 --> 49:17.455
but Jenard fucked us
out the deal,

49:17.488 --> 49:20.224
so I went back and told
Cousin Buddy fuck coke.

49:20.258 --> 49:22.327
We got Dahlia for him.

49:22.360 --> 49:23.695
I don't know
who the fuck that is.

49:23.728 --> 49:25.296
- You give him my name?
- No.

49:25.330 --> 49:27.532
- You tell him where we was?
- No.

49:27.565 --> 49:30.668
- Was you fucking followed here?
- No.

49:30.702 --> 49:32.503
I don't know. No.

49:32.537 --> 49:34.372
Why you tripping, man?
This is a good thing!

49:34.405 --> 49:35.640
I did this for you.

49:35.673 --> 49:39.143
No one asked you
to bring this shit to Gary!

49:39.177 --> 49:41.012
Man, I was trying to do
something good for you.

49:41.045 --> 49:43.081
Yeah, well, you could
have got yourself killed!

49:43.114 --> 49:45.016
All of us dead!

49:45.049 --> 49:47.485
You got this
huge fucking future,

49:47.518 --> 49:49.454
and you out here
doing dumb shit!

49:49.487 --> 49:51.489
Running with
that trash bag Jenard,

49:51.522 --> 49:53.224
making bad deals,

49:53.257 --> 49:54.559
shooting up clubs
for attention.

49:54.592 --> 49:56.194
Wait, what the fuck
you just say?

49:56.227 --> 49:58.196
Yeah, I know it was you
that shot up the club,

49:58.229 --> 50:00.365
and I know that JP
is your father.

50:02.700 --> 50:04.569
And I'm your uncle, D-Mac.

50:06.404 --> 50:07.705
So I gotta protect you.

50:07.739 --> 50:09.140
Shut the fuck up!

50:09.173 --> 50:10.341
We family, D-Mac.

50:11.776 --> 50:16.047
You and me and... JP.

50:18.616 --> 50:20.685
And I know
you ain't gonna shoot me.

50:20.718 --> 50:22.086
Try me.

50:23.321 --> 50:25.390
'Cause you ain't no killer.

50:55.153 --> 50:57.155
You know, I followed you
to that old house.

50:59.424 --> 51:02.059
I saw y'all there together.

51:02.093 --> 51:03.828
But I ain't know you was fam.

51:06.497 --> 51:08.199
I couldn't even--

51:10.401 --> 51:12.737
Shit is just so fucked up.

51:12.770 --> 51:14.338
Yeah, all the way around.

51:16.340 --> 51:19.143
<i>Should have told you, told JP.</i>

51:20.311 --> 51:22.280
<i>Waited for the time.</i>

51:25.650 --> 51:28.186
Now it's on you to tell him.

51:28.219 --> 51:30.087
Wait, what?

51:30.121 --> 51:31.756
Wait, fuck that.

51:32.690 --> 51:34.358
Man, you the adult.

51:34.392 --> 51:37.128
You should have been
way more responsible.

51:37.161 --> 51:40.331
Okay, I'll do it.

51:42.633 --> 51:44.335
But you coming with me.

51:44.368 --> 51:46.504
<i>We do this shit together.</i>

51:46.537 --> 51:48.239
Put that shit away.

51:55.646 --> 51:57.715
How you think he gonna take it?

51:57.748 --> 51:59.116
About as good as you.

52:00.585 --> 52:03.888
Man, I ain't calling you
Uncle Tommy.

52:04.121 --> 52:06.657
- It's a'ight.
- Maybe just Tom.

52:06.691 --> 52:08.626
Well, that ain't never
gonna fucking happen.

52:11.128 --> 52:12.330
Go! Move!

52:22.306 --> 52:23.608
<i>Uncle Tommy!</i>

52:24.842 --> 52:26.811
Fuck.

52:28.479 --> 52:31.916
Oh, fuck. Get up, get up.

52:32.149 --> 52:33.384
- Oh, fuck.
- Shit.

52:33.417 --> 52:34.819
Come here, come here.

52:34.852 --> 52:36.787
Keep it right there. Come here.

52:36.821 --> 52:38.422
Come on, come on.

52:45.463 --> 52:46.597
Jesus Christ.

52:46.631 --> 52:47.865
No, no, man,
it-it ain't my blood.

52:47.899 --> 52:49.901
I'm a'ight.

52:49.934 --> 52:53.738
Okay, okay, so what's up?
Why you call me here?

52:53.771 --> 52:55.673
You know the boy that's been
shooting up your club?

52:55.706 --> 52:56.874
The one with the dreads?

52:56.908 --> 52:58.676
Yeah.

52:58.709 --> 52:59.877
He got hit, JP.

52:59.911 --> 53:01.712
He's bad.

53:01.746 --> 53:04.649
Well, you live by the sword,
you die by it.

53:09.453 --> 53:10.788
He's your son.

53:12.356 --> 53:13.457
My son?

53:19.397 --> 53:20.765
He had this.

53:25.369 --> 53:26.470
How long have you known?

53:26.504 --> 53:27.772
I been knowing for a minute.

53:27.805 --> 53:29.340
I was just waiting
for the right time to tell you.

53:29.373 --> 53:32.276
The right time is the
motherfucking second you knew.

53:32.310 --> 53:34.378
Not after he's
fighting for his life!

53:34.412 --> 53:35.780
No, I know, and-and--

53:35.813 --> 53:37.448
I ain't got time for this!

53:38.816 --> 53:40.952
I gotta see my son.

54:08.746 --> 54:10.247
Thanks for coming so quickly.

54:10.281 --> 54:11.882
Appreciate you making the trip.

54:11.916 --> 54:15.953
Happy to be here.
Happy to do what we do best.

54:17.622 --> 54:21.525
Claudia, you're looking
as beautiful as ever.

54:21.559 --> 54:24.495
Since when did your father
let you sit down with the men?

54:24.528 --> 54:26.430
Since now.

54:26.464 --> 54:27.632
