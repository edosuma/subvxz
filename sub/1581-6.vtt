your strength and resolve.

You must really
be feeling the pressure.

Who's under pressure?

01:24.722 --> 01:26.722
Not the guy who's won
every assessment.

Yeah, but today
I can taste victory.

And must climb out
with all deliberate speed.

You will be given
the honor of serving as aides

01:47.545 --> 01:51.547
Those who lose
will be serving

01:51.549 --> 01:54.516
And wish they'd stayed
at the bottom of that well.

01:54.518 --> 01:57.486
I'm taking that prize.
Not today, kell.

You too, morgan.

03:13.264 --> 03:15.464
It's like you know the platforms
are coming before they're there.

03:15.466 --> 03:17.633
What can I say? It's a gift!

03:20.537 --> 03:25.340
Morgan is impressive.
Perhaps too impressive.
Make a note of that.

You said that yesterday too.

Quite a finish, cadets.
It seems this trial
was too easy.

03:56.440 --> 04:00.609
Morgan, kell,
you both set course records.

You're worried
about ezra.

I'm not worried about the kid.
I'm worried about the op.

This was your idea.

He's just not ready.
And if he gets caught--

05:12.550 --> 05:14.483
He hasn't gotten caught
so far.

05:14.485 --> 05:17.419
The minute he gets that decoder,
zeb yanks him out of there.

Uh, that's the plan.

I should've
done this myself.

05:20.624 --> 05:23.659
Oh, yeah.
You'd make quite a cadet.

Figured it would be
something like this.
It's not what you think.

06:51.515 --> 06:53.882
I think this device
has a built-in sensor,

06:53.884 --> 06:53.882
Which would trigger that.

Do you want to stop
that kyber shipment or not?

07:31.822 --> 07:34.589
You know what the empire
could do with that crystal.

- Nothing good.
- So we give ezra one more day.

My friends need it to stop

07:55.579 --> 07:58.714
How'd you know
about the sensors?
From my sister, dhara.

07:58.716 --> 08:00.649
She was the star cadet
in this place.

08:00.651 --> 08:03.051
She knew the entire
imperial complex
backwards and forwards.

08:03.053 --> 08:05.921
- What happened to her?
- Well, they told us
she ran off.

08:05.923 --> 08:09.624
But I don't believe it.
What were you doing breaking
into kallus's office?

08:09.626 --> 08:10.993
That's a great way
to get shot.

08:10.995 --> 08:13.662
Long story,
but I need that decoder.

08:13.664 --> 08:16.565
And I could use a partner
who knows his way around.
What's in it for me?

08:16.567 --> 08:19.067
Do you really need a reason
to mess with the empire?

08:20.236 --> 08:22.804
No, I don't.

08:22.806 --> 08:22.804

15:59.361 --> 16:00.695
[ beeping ]

16:06.101 --> 16:10.104
So these control movement
and this fires the cannons.
But what are these?

16:10.106 --> 16:12.273
Gyroscopics.
Here, I'll show you.

16:26.288 --> 16:27.655
[ rapid beeping ]

16:31.060 --> 16:33.261
- We're under attack!
- What was that?

16:33.263 --> 16:35.196
My signal.

16:35.198 --> 16:36.564
What are you doing?

16:36.566 --> 16:39.734
[ grunts, groans ]

16:42.338 --> 16:45.640
Guess there's
no turning back now.
No.

16:53.782 --> 16:55.216
[ shouts ]

16:57.620 --> 16:59.587
Calculate the jump
to hyperspace.

16:59.589 --> 17:02.524
Have every remaining ship
buy us the time we need.

17:10.465 --> 17:14.002
We are under attack.
Repeat, under attack.
Lower the blast doors!

17:17.506 --> 17:19.607
Look!
Do something!

17:26.648 --> 17:30.652
Commandant! Whoever's
controlling that walker
is part of the attack!

17:30.654 --> 17:32.654
This is lrc-01.

17:32.656 --> 17:35.123
A rogue walker is loose
in the academy.

17:35.125 --> 17:36.491
Advance and destroy.

17:42.298 --> 17:44.299
[ grunting ]
fire back!

17:44.301 --> 17:45.667
I'm trying!

17:50.105 --> 17:53.241
Hera, that transport's
gonna be gone any second
and the cargo along with it.

17:53.243 --> 17:54.609
Take your shot!

18:02.351 --> 18:05.253
Calculations
complete.
Commence hyperspace jump.

18:22.571 --> 18:24.672
- Hera!
- I see it! Come on!

18:56.605 --> 18:58.406
- Let me in!
- Look!

18:58.408 --> 19:02.143
Morgan's attempting
to fight off the insurgents
single-handed!

19:02.145 --> 19:05.580
Whoa!
[ grunts ]

19:10.452 --> 19:11.786
Whoa!

19:11.788 --> 19:12.920
Hold on!

19:16.458 --> 19:19.360
[ blaster cocks ]
[ groans ]

19:30.305 --> 19:32.340
Thanks.
Don't mention it.

19:33.308 --> 19:34.676
[ screams ]

19:36.211 --> 19:37.745
- [ droid language ]
- [ chuckles ]

19:37.747 --> 19:41.182
- [ banging ]
- help me!
We gotta get 'em out.

19:43.552 --> 19:45.787
You guys okay?
Yeah. Let's just
get out of here.

19:45.789 --> 19:47.622
Wait.
Give me that blaster.

19:47.624 --> 19:48.956
Uh, sure. Why?

19:48.958 --> 19:51.259
- Because I'm staying.
- What?

19:51.261 --> 19:52.760
It's the only way
I'll ever find my sister.

19:52.762 --> 19:54.662
We got bucketheads inbound!

19:55.931 --> 19:57.932
I'll keep in touch.

20:02.805 --> 20:04.672
Get in!

20:20.289 --> 20:22.757
This is a black mark,
commandant.

20:22.759 --> 20:26.961
I do not know this boy,
but this one I know.

20:26.963 --> 20:29.764
This is the padawan
I encountered
on stygeon prime.

20:29.766 --> 20:33.468
That is morgan.
The other was kell.

20:33.470 --> 20:37.905
Cadet zare leonis here
came very close
to stopping the escape.

20:37.907 --> 20:40.575
He was part of
the traitor's squad
and knew them well,

20:40.577 --> 20:42.510
Or thought so.

20:42.512 --> 20:44.579
How admirable.

20:44.581 --> 20:47.915
Well, leonis,
let's take a walk,
shall we?

20:47.917 --> 20:51.652
I want to know everything
about your former friends.

20:55.991 --> 20:59.861
Jai, we'll take you to
your mother, but you'll both
have to go into hiding.

20:59.863 --> 21:02.563
Yeah, from the empire.
No problem.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.632
We'll help
with that too.

21:09.338 --> 21:11.372
So how was it, kid?

21:11.374 --> 21:14.442
Forgot what it was like
to be on my own.
You miss it?

21:14.444 --> 21:18.913
No grumpy robots,
no smelly lasats.

21:18.915 --> 21:20.948
- It's good to be back.
- [ chuckles ]

21:20.950 --> 21:22.717
At ease, cadet.

21:23.552 --> 21:25.419
Sir, yes, sir.
