01:11.363 --> 01:12.865
Come here, lad.

01:24.501 --> 01:28.589
What are you doing on my property?

01:28.714 --> 01:29.840
I've come to claim back

01:29.923 --> 01:31.675
what's rightfully mine, sir.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.343
That thieving young rascal

01:33.427 --> 01:35.053
made off with some horseshoes

01:35.179 --> 01:36.930
and a bag of nails from my smithy.

01:44.062 --> 01:47.399
Where is your proof?

01:47.524 --> 01:50.819
The proof is, I'll find them there.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.196
Now, I don't want to be forced

01:52.279 --> 01:56.450
to call the police.

01:56.575 --> 01:59.578
These people are guests of mine,

01:59.703 --> 02:04.416
but you are trespassing, Mr. Thorn.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.044
I'm not afraid of you, Doctor.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.464
Get off my land!

02:41.036 --> 02:42.496
Please, come back soon.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.206
My dear, there is nothing

02:44.331 --> 02:46.250
whatever to worry about.

02:46.333 --> 02:50.504
We should be married in a few weeks.

02:50.629 --> 02:54.216
I'm just on my way back to London.

02:54.341 --> 02:57.261
Goodbye, sir, and thank you

02:57.344 --> 02:59.930
for a most pleasant weekend.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.515
I mean to improve my game of chess

03:01.640 --> 03:04.142
before my next visit.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.478
Oh, yes, I see.

03:06.562 --> 03:08.856
You weren't an unworthy opponent.

03:08.981 --> 03:13.861
Thank you, sir.

03:13.986 --> 03:17.155
I'm just seeing Percy down to
the gates, Father.

03:17.239 --> 03:18.365
Heh.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.504
Drive on and wait for me
by the gate, will you.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.154
The fellow was trespassing,

03:57.237 --> 04:01.533
he had a dunking, and that is all.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.203
Father, I cannot believe that
Thorn would deliberate -

04:04.328 --> 04:07.122
Dammit, woman,

04:07.247 --> 04:11.877
are you part of the conspiracy
against me, too?

04:11.960 --> 04:23.305
No, Father, I live here.

04:23.430 --> 04:27.226
Not for much longer, eh,

04:27.309 --> 04:32.064
once you marry that fellow Armitage.

05:02.344 --> 05:05.639
Yes, what is it?

05:05.764 --> 05:10.561
Father, what has happened
to my room?

05:10.644 --> 05:12.938
The builders found a fault
in the structure,

05:13.063 --> 05:14.314
better sleep in your sister's room

05:14.439 --> 05:17.317
till they've finished working on it.

05:17.442 --> 05:22.739
Julia's room, I can't sleep in there.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.617
Why not, Pray?

05:25.742 --> 05:27.786
I can't.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.246
What is the matter,

05:29.329 --> 05:30.998
it's a perfectly good room.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.457
I've instructed the housekeeper
to prepare it for you.

05:32.541 --> 05:36.086
Now run along, your baggage,
and goodnight.

06:48.617 --> 06:55.541
Hello there young beauty,
good night, good night.

07:56.935 --> 07:59.229
I'm very sorry, Watson,

07:59.313 --> 08:03.567
but it seems to be
the common lot this morning.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.277
What?

08:05.360 --> 08:07.821
Mrs. Hudson has been roused,

08:07.905 --> 08:11.033
she retorted on me, and I on you.

08:11.158 --> 08:14.161
But it's only a quarter past seven,

08:14.286 --> 08:16.455
what is it, a fire?

08:16.538 --> 08:19.791
No, No, a client.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.713
This will take a moment to draw, sir.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.799
But only a moment,
Mrs. Hudson is a mistress

08:27.883 --> 08:30.427
of the art of fire lighting.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.554
Ah, this is my intimate friend

08:32.679 --> 08:34.472
and associate, Dr. Watson,

08:34.556 --> 08:38.434
before whom you may speak
as freely as before myself.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.270
How do you do?

08:40.354 --> 08:41.730
Mrs. Hudson, do you think you could

08:41.855 --> 08:44.149
bring this young lady
a hot cup of coffee,

08:44.232 --> 08:48.195
for I observed you are shivering.

08:48.320 --> 08:51.657
It is not cold which makes me shiver.

08:51.782 --> 08:55.244
What, then?

08:55.369 --> 08:58.497
It is fear, Mr. Holmes.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.999
It is terror.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.501
You must not fear,

09:02.626 --> 09:04.002
we shall set matters right,

09:04.086 --> 09:08.048
have no doubt.

09:08.131 --> 09:11.844
You have come by train, I see,
this morning.

09:11.969 --> 09:13.470
You know me, then?

09:13.554 --> 09:16.181
No, but I observed the second half
of a return ticket

09:16.265 --> 09:19.518
in the palm of your left glove.

09:19.601 --> 09:22.062
You started early, but you had a drive

09:22.187 --> 09:24.314
in a dog-cart, along heavy roads,

09:24.398 --> 09:27.067
before you reached the station.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.027
There is no mystery, my dear lady,

09:29.152 --> 09:30.737
the left arm of your jacket

09:30.863 --> 09:32.281
is spattered with mud

09:32.406 --> 09:34.116
in no less than seven places,

09:34.241 --> 09:36.034
the marks are fresh.

09:36.118 --> 09:37.578
There is no vehicle

09:37.661 --> 09:39.663
save a dog-cart which throws up mud

09:39.746 --> 09:41.415
in that particular way,

09:41.540 --> 09:43.417
and then only when you sit on

09:43.542 --> 09:46.044
the left-hand side of the driver.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.213
You are perfectly correct.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.549
Sir, I can stand the strain no longer;

09:50.674 --> 09:54.761
I shall go mad if it continues.

09:54.887 --> 09:57.264
I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh,

09:57.389 --> 10:01.143
whom you helped
in the hour of her sore need.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.271
Farintosh.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.031
My dear Helen,

10:14.114 --> 10:15.616
it is difficult for me to advise you

10:15.741 --> 10:17.534
since you present so few facts,

10:17.618 --> 10:18.994
but I know you to be a sensible girl,

10:19.119 --> 10:20.495
not prone to hysterics.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.790
I was one of your poor,
dear mother's oldest friends.

10:23.916 --> 10:27.377
I can only suggest that
if your fears persist,

10:27.503 --> 10:31.757
you should contact
Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

10:31.840 --> 10:36.094
221B Baker Street.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.599
Farintosh, oh, yes,
I do remember the case.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.226
It concerned an opal tiara.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.479
I think it was before your time, Watson.

10:45.604 --> 10:48.565
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.276
Sir, do you not think
you could help me, too?

10:51.360 --> 10:53.487
At present it is out of my power
to reward you,

10:53.612 --> 10:55.364
but in a few weeks I should be married

10:55.489 --> 10:57.366
with control of my own income.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.493
I shall be happy to
devote the same care

10:59.618 --> 11:02.746
to your case as to that of your friend.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.456
As to reward my profession

11:04.581 --> 11:06.583
is its own reward;

11:06.708 --> 11:08.252
but you are at liberty to defray

11:08.335 --> 11:11.088
whatever expenses I may be
put to at the time

11:11.171 --> 11:12.673
which suits you best.

11:12.756 --> 11:15.843
And now I beg you,
lay everything before us

11:15.968 --> 11:20.430
which may help us form
an opinion upon this matter.

11:20.556 --> 11:24.142
My name is Helen Stoner.

11:24.226 --> 11:25.853
I live with my stepfather,

11:25.978 --> 11:27.646
Dr. Grimesby Roylott,

11:27.729 --> 11:29.982
who is the last survivor of
one of the oldest

11:30.107 --> 11:31.567
Saxon families in England.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.151
The Roylotts of Stoke Moran,

11:33.277 --> 11:35.237
the name is familiar to me.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.322
He is a doctor by profession,

11:37.447 --> 11:39.157
a skilled one.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.493
For some years he had a
large and flourishing practice

11:41.618 --> 11:43.745
in India, in Calcutta.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.831
Ah.

11:45.914 --> 11:49.668
Dr. Watson has also practiced
medicine in India.

11:49.793 --> 11:54.590
Yes, attached to the Fifth
Northumberland Fusiliers.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.925
Pray continue, Miss Stoner.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.721
In Calcutta, he married my mother.

12:00.846 --> 12:05.517
She was the young widow of Major
mother's remarriage,

12:08.645 --> 12:11.857
and my sister, Julia,
was five years older.

12:11.982 --> 12:15.360
Our mother had a considerable
sum of money -

12:15.444 --> 12:17.279
not less than a thousand a year -

12:17.404 --> 12:19.740
and this she bequeathed to
Dr. Roylott entirely

12:19.865 --> 12:21.575
while we resided with him.

12:21.700 --> 12:25.162
Forgive me,
your mother has passed on?

12:25.287 --> 12:27.331
Shortly after our return to England,

12:27.414 --> 12:30.042
she was killed

12:30.125 --> 12:34.546
in a railway accident near Crewe.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.507
My stepfather then
abandoned his attempts

12:36.590 --> 12:38.884
to establish himself in
practice in London

12:39.009 --> 12:41.053
and took us to live
in his ancestral house

12:41.178 --> 12:42.304
at Stoke Moran.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.680
But the money your mother left you

12:43.764 --> 12:45.390
was enough for all your wants,

12:45.516 --> 12:48.101
so that was no obstacle
to your happiness?

12:48.227 --> 12:52.189
A terrible change came over
my stepfather,

12:52.272 --> 12:54.024
instead of making friends and
exchanging visits

12:54.107 --> 12:55.776
with our neighbors,

12:55.901 --> 12:57.110
who at first were overjoyed

12:57.236 --> 12:59.905
to see a Roylott back
in the family seat,

13:00.030 --> 13:01.698
he shut himself up in the house

13:01.782 --> 13:03.700
and indulged in ferocious quarrels.

13:03.784 --> 13:06.078
At times it was and still is
hard to keep him out

13:06.203 --> 13:08.121
of the police courts.

13:08.247 --> 13:09.873
He's become the terror of the village.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.458
Does he permit any visitors?

13:11.542 --> 13:16.588
No, except my fiancÃ© and
some wandering gypsies.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.090
Gypsies?

13:18.215 --> 13:20.092
Vagabonds, whom he has given leave

13:20.217 --> 13:22.719
to encamp on his land.

13:22.845 --> 13:27.015
Sometimes he goes away with them
for days at a time.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.434
You can imagine from what I'm saying

13:29.560 --> 13:32.479
that my poor sister Julia and I

13:32.604 --> 13:35.983
had no great pleasure in our lives.

13:36.108 --> 13:37.860
No servant would stay long

13:37.985 --> 13:42.447
so we did all the work of the house.

13:42.573 --> 13:46.451
She was but 30 when I lost her,

13:46.535 --> 13:48.745
but already her hair
had begun to whiten,

13:48.829 --> 13:50.998
even as mine has.

13:51.123 --> 13:53.083
Your sister is dead?

13:53.208 --> 13:55.919
Just two years ago.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.255
It is of that I wish to talk to you.

14:05.554 --> 14:07.222
Living the life we did,

14:07.347 --> 14:08.807
we were little likely to see anyone

14:08.932 --> 14:12.144
of our own age and position,

14:12.269 --> 14:15.731
but we were occasionally
allowed short visits.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.399
Two years ago,

14:17.524 --> 14:19.693
Julia met a half-pay major of marines,

14:19.818 --> 14:21.778
to whom she became engaged.

14:23.238 --> 14:27.034
Your stepfather approved of the match?

14:27.159 --> 14:29.411
He raised no objection at all.

14:29.536 --> 14:33.832
A fortnight before the wedding,

14:33.957 --> 14:35.751
a terrible event occurred

14:35.876 --> 14:38.504
which deprived me of
my only companion.

14:38.629 --> 14:45.093
Pray- be precise as to details.

14:45.219 --> 14:47.971
It is easy,

14:48.055 --> 14:53.310
every event of that night is
seared into my memory.

14:53.393 --> 14:57.147
It was late, about 11:00,

14:57.231 --> 14:59.775
Julia had come into my room.

15:08.575 --> 15:13.372
He's smoking those awful cigars again.

15:13.497 --> 15:16.375
Perhaps you should have this room
until the wedding.

15:23.632 --> 15:32.516
Oh, Helen, oh, I feel so happy.

15:32.599 --> 15:36.103
And yet wretched that I'm
leaving you here alone.

15:36.228 --> 15:38.438
My turn will come.

15:38.564 --> 15:41.108
I shall miss you.

15:41.233 --> 15:44.611
No, you won't, I'll come and stay.

15:44.736 --> 15:48.073
Besides, your major has
promised to find me

15:48.198 --> 15:50.284
a brother officer of equal rank,

15:50.409 --> 15:56.373
and infinitely better looking.

15:56.456 --> 16:03.755
My darling, what is the matter?

16:03.881 --> 16:07.467
Helen, have you ever
heard anyone whistle

16:07.593 --> 16:11.513
in the dead of night?

16:11.638 --> 16:16.268
I suppose you couldn't possibly
whistle yourself, in your sleep?

16:16.393 --> 16:20.105
Certainly not, why?

16:20.230 --> 16:22.941
The last few nights,

16:23.066 --> 16:25.694
always about 3:00 in the morning,

16:25.819 --> 16:28.947
I've been woken by a low, clear whistle.

16:29.072 --> 16:30.657
I can't tell where it's coming from.

16:30.782 --> 16:33.160
I thought you might have heard it.

16:33.285 --> 16:38.123
I sleep more heavily than you.

16:38.248 --> 16:44.463
It was probably those wretched gypsies.

16:44.588 --> 16:49.510
Well, never mind.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.612
Was it your custom always

17:08.737 --> 17:10.696
to lock yourself in at night?

17:10.781 --> 17:13.909
Always, my stepfather has a passion

17:14.034 --> 17:16.203
for Indian animals.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.121
A leopard and baboon

17:18.204 --> 17:21.458
wander freely over the grounds.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.544
Julia and I had no feelings of security

17:23.627 --> 17:26.046
unless our doors and windows
were locked.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.970
I couldn't sleep,

17:33.095 --> 17:38.058
I had a vague feeling of misfortune.

17:42.980 --> 17:46.942
Julia!

18:10.299 --> 18:13.886
Please help me.

18:18.599 --> 18:29.318
Oh, my God, Helen, It was the band...

18:29.443 --> 18:35.073
the speckled band.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.408
I'll get father.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.494
No!

18:41.955 --> 18:43.457
Go into your room child,

18:43.582 --> 18:46.251
I'll deal with this.

19:13.278 --> 19:16.240
I am sorry, gentlemen.

19:16.365 --> 19:20.202
My sister and I were very close.

19:20.327 --> 19:24.331
Yes indeed.

19:24.456 --> 19:27.042
What a mournful experience.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.258
And you've no idea what
might have caused -

19:34.341 --> 19:37.970
This whistle and metallic sound,

19:38.095 --> 19:41.056
you can swear to it?

19:41.181 --> 19:43.600
It is my strong impression,

19:43.684 --> 19:46.562
I may possibly have been deceived.

19:46.687 --> 19:48.230
Was your sister dressed?

19:48.355 --> 19:50.649
No, she was in her night dress.

19:50.774 --> 19:53.110
Uh, on the floor there was a candle

19:53.193 --> 19:55.320
and the charred stump of a match.

19:55.404 --> 19:58.198
Which means, something must
have woken her up,

19:58.323 --> 20:03.787
and she struck a light to see
what the matter was.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.998
What conclusions did
the coroner come to?

20:06.123 --> 20:07.749
He investigated the case
with great care,

20:07.875 --> 20:11.587
but he was unable to find any
satisfactory cause of death.

20:11.712 --> 20:13.338
And your evidence would have shown

20:13.463 --> 20:16.175
that the door was fastened
on the inner side,

20:16.258 --> 20:19.178
the windows blocked by shutters,
secured every night.

20:19.261 --> 20:20.846
It is certain, therefore,

20:20.971 --> 20:23.640
that your sister was alone

20:23.724 --> 20:26.602
when she met her end?

20:26.727 --> 20:28.187
Yes.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.771
Besides, there were no marks

20:29.897 --> 20:33.150
of violence upon her.

20:33.233 --> 20:36.695
What about poison?

20:36.778 --> 20:43.243
The doctors examined her for it,
without success.

20:43.368 --> 20:50.542
What do you think this unfortunate
lady died of, then?

20:50.626 --> 20:52.544
It's my belief that she died

20:52.669 --> 20:56.507
of pure fear and nervous shock,

20:56.590 --> 21:01.637
though what it was which frightened her
I cannot imagine.

21:01.762 --> 21:05.182
What do you gather from the allusion to
a band, a speckled band?

21:05.265 --> 21:08.060
Delirium.

21:08.185 --> 21:13.690
Or some band of people.

21:13.774 --> 21:17.736
The gypsies at the plantation
have spotted

21:17.819 --> 21:23.951
handkerchiefs they wear
around their necks.

21:24.076 --> 21:29.581
These are very deep waters.

21:29.706 --> 21:33.001
What happened after
your sister's death?

21:33.126 --> 21:35.921
My life was lonelier than ever

21:36.004 --> 21:37.506
until a month ago,

21:37.631 --> 21:39.424
when a dear friend of mine,

21:39.550 --> 21:41.176
whom I have known for many years,

21:41.301 --> 21:43.846
did me the honor to ask for
my hand in marriage.

21:43.971 --> 21:45.973
His name is Mr. Percy Armitage.

21:46.098 --> 21:49.977
And you are to be married
within a few weeks.

21:50.102 --> 21:51.562
So what prompted you to come here

21:51.687 --> 21:54.106
when your life seems set so fair?

21:54.189 --> 21:57.150
Yesterday, some repairs were started

21:57.234 --> 21:59.236
and my bedroom wall was pierced,

21:59.361 --> 22:01.071
so that last night I was forced

22:01.154 --> 22:03.782
to move into the chamber
in which Julia died,

22:03.866 --> 22:05.200
to sleep in the very bed

22:05.325 --> 22:06.743
in which she slept.

22:06.827 --> 22:09.121
Imagine my terror when
I was woken by the same

22:09.204 --> 22:12.875
low whistle which had been the
herald of her own death.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.293
You lit a lamp?

22:14.376 --> 22:16.628
Yes, but nothing was to be seen.

22:16.712 --> 22:18.213
I was too shaken to sleep.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.882
I dressed and slipped out of the house.

22:20.007 --> 22:21.466
I got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn,

22:21.550 --> 22:23.302
and came to London with one objective,

22:23.385 --> 22:26.930
asking your advice.

22:27.055 --> 22:31.518
You did wisely.

22:31.643 --> 22:35.522
But have you told me all?

22:35.647 --> 22:37.274
Yes.

22:37.357 --> 22:41.862
You have not, Miss Stoner.

22:41.987 --> 22:46.658
You are shielding your stepfather.

22:46.742 --> 22:49.536
He is a hard man, but he's still

22:49.661 --> 22:53.999
the only father I have known.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.960
I'd say it was time for some breakfast.

22:57.044 --> 22:59.463
There are a thousand details
I desire to know

22:59.546 --> 23:01.715
before I decide on a course of action.

23:01.840 --> 23:05.010
If we were to come to
Stoke Moran today,

23:05.093 --> 23:06.553
could we see over these rooms

23:06.678 --> 23:09.014
without the knowledge
of your stepfather?

23:09.139 --> 23:10.432
As it happens, he spoke of coming

23:10.557 --> 23:12.142
to town today on some business.

23:12.226 --> 23:13.227
And the workmen?

23:13.352 --> 23:14.186
I have seen none.

23:14.311 --> 23:15.938
We have a woman who comes
to clean from the village,

23:16.063 --> 23:17.356
but only in the morning.

23:17.439 --> 23:18.774
There should be nothing to disturb you.

23:18.899 --> 23:19.233
Excellent.

23:19.358 --> 23:21.193
Watson, you are not averse
to this trip?

23:21.276 --> 23:23.320
By no means.

23:23.403 --> 23:26.281
Then we will be with you
in the early afternoon.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.200
I shall be there for your arrival.

23:31.078 --> 23:33.705
You'll stay for some breakfast, surely?

23:33.789 --> 23:35.666
Thank you, no.

23:40.212 --> 23:43.590
My heart is lightened already.

23:54.601 --> 23:59.982
Ah, Mrs. Hudson, thank you.

24:00.107 --> 24:05.028
When you combine the ideas of
whistles at night,

24:05.112 --> 24:07.030
the presence of a band of gypsies

24:07.114 --> 24:09.366
on intimate terms with the doctor,

24:09.449 --> 24:14.371
the dying allusion to
a speckled band, well,

24:14.454 --> 24:16.456
there's good ground to believe
that the mystery

24:16.540 --> 24:19.042
may be cleared along those lines.

24:24.464 --> 24:28.594
Which one of you is Holmes?

24:28.677 --> 24:31.054
My name, sir;

24:31.138 --> 24:33.849
but you have the advantage of me.

24:33.974 --> 24:35.559
I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott,

24:35.642 --> 24:40.147
of Stoke Moran.

24:40.272 --> 24:45.235
Indeed, Doctor, please take a seat.

24:45.319 --> 24:47.779
I shall do nothing of the kind.

24:47.863 --> 24:49.531
I know that my stepdaughter

24:49.656 --> 24:51.617
has been here this morning.

24:51.742 --> 24:54.244
What has she been saying to you?

24:54.328 --> 24:58.540
It is a little cold for
the time of the year.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.501
What has she been saying to you?

25:00.626 --> 25:03.420
But I have heard that
the crops promise well.

25:03.504 --> 25:07.466
Ah, you put me off, do you?

25:07.549 --> 25:09.676
You scoundrel, sir.

25:09.801 --> 25:12.304
I've heard of you before.

25:12.429 --> 25:14.223
You are Holmes, the meddler,

25:14.348 --> 25:15.474
Holmes the busybody,

25:15.557 --> 25:19.478
Holmes, the Scotland Yard
Jack-in-office.

25:19.603 --> 25:22.940
Your conversation really is
most entertaining,

25:23.023 --> 25:25.108
if you would close the door,

25:25.234 --> 25:29.488
on your way out,
as there is a decided draft.

25:29.613 --> 25:32.699
I will go when I have said my say.

25:32.825 --> 25:35.869
Don't you dare to interfere
in my affairs.

25:35.994 --> 25:39.706
I know that Miss Stoner has been here.

25:53.720 --> 25:58.267
I am a dangerous man to fall foul of.

26:05.566 --> 26:10.863
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,
just another client.

26:10.946 --> 26:16.201
What a very amiable person.

26:16.326 --> 26:18.829
I may not be quite so bulky, but -

26:25.252 --> 26:26.712
fancy his having the insolence

26:26.795 --> 26:30.507
to confound me with
the official detective force.

26:30.591 --> 26:34.803
Ah, this incident gives zest
to our investigation.

26:34.928 --> 26:36.471
I only hope our friend won't suffer

26:36.597 --> 26:38.473
from her imprudence in
allowing that brute

26:38.599 --> 26:40.142
to trace her here.

26:40.267 --> 26:42.436
One thought keeps nagging
at me, Watson,

26:42.561 --> 26:45.189
Roylott's professional life in India,

26:45.272 --> 26:46.607
if it was so successful,

26:46.732 --> 26:48.442
why would he exchange it for a life

26:48.567 --> 26:50.611
of aristocratic penury?

26:50.736 --> 26:53.405
My friend Cooms would know.

26:53.530 --> 26:56.408
Cooms was in Calcutta
around that time.

26:56.492 --> 26:57.868
Find your friend Cooms

26:57.951 --> 27:01.580
and see what you can get from him.

27:01.705 --> 27:03.874
I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons,

27:03.957 --> 27:05.751
where I hope to get some data

27:05.834 --> 27:07.628
which may help us in this matter.

27:07.753 --> 27:13.592
Let us meet again at 1:00 under
the clock at Waterloo Station.

27:13.675 --> 27:16.178
That is, if you've finished your
breakfast by then.

27:16.303 --> 27:19.681
Oh, and your revolver,

27:19.806 --> 27:21.808
I would be obliged if you would
slip it into your pocket.

27:21.934 --> 27:23.602
An Eley #2 is an excellent argument

27:23.727 --> 27:27.105
against gentlemen who can
twist steel pokers into knots.

27:27.189 --> 27:29.316
That, and your toothbrush,

27:29.441 --> 27:31.902
are I think all we need.

27:34.863 --> 27:37.407
I've seen the will of
the deceased wife.

27:37.491 --> 27:39.284
Her annual income
at the time of her death

27:39.409 --> 27:42.120
was a little short of 1100 pounds,

27:42.204 --> 27:44.122
but, due to the fall in
agricultural prices,

27:44.248 --> 27:46.750
there's now no more than 750 pounds.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.126
Each girl in case of marriage,

27:48.210 --> 27:49.795
could claim 250 pounds.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.297
So, if both girls had married,
ah, beauty,

27:52.422 --> 27:56.635
Grimesby Roylott would have had
a mere pittance.

27:56.760 --> 28:00.472
And even one marriage would ruin him.

28:00.556 --> 28:04.810
The strongest possible motive.

28:04.893 --> 28:08.647
Oh, did you manage to find Cooms?

28:08.730 --> 28:10.524
Yes, I did.

28:10.649 --> 28:12.442
He proved rather hard to locate,

28:12.526 --> 28:13.819
but I finally managed

28:13.944 --> 28:16.196
to get him through Swanson at Bards.

28:16.321 --> 28:18.824
He did know Roylott in Calcutta,

28:18.949 --> 28:22.369
confirmed what the girl had said,

28:22.494 --> 28:24.955
and added one intriguing fact.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.791
Now, it seems that
a series of robberies

28:27.875 --> 28:29.751
had been perpetrated in his house,

28:29.877 --> 28:32.212
and suspicion fell on
his native butler.

28:32.337 --> 28:34.840
Roylott promptly seized the man,

28:34.965 --> 28:36.383
and in a fit of anger

28:36.508 --> 28:39.428
beat the poor fellow to death,

28:39.553 --> 28:42.097
narrowly escaped a capital sentence,

28:42.222 --> 28:44.433
but suffered a long term
of imprisonment,

28:44.558 --> 28:46.518
and returned to this country

28:46.602 --> 28:52.441
a morose and disappointed man.

28:52.566 --> 28:58.113
Ah, Watson, it's a wicked world.

28:58.238 --> 29:03.202
And when a clever man
turns his brain to crime,

29:03.327 --> 29:06.622
it's the worst of all.

29:22.971 --> 29:25.724
On holiday, are you, gentlemen?

29:25.849 --> 29:28.060
No, we're architects,

29:28.185 --> 29:30.187
taking a look at some of
the local houses.

29:30.270 --> 29:33.065
Ah, that's why you're wanting
Stoke Moran.

29:33.148 --> 29:36.068
I didn't think it was
for social reasons.

29:36.151 --> 29:40.364
You'll be, doing business with
Dr. Roylott then?

29:40.447 --> 29:43.075
Yes, I believe that was the name.

29:43.158 --> 29:44.868
If you don't mind a word of warning,

29:44.952 --> 29:47.412
you want to take care with him, sir.

29:47.538 --> 29:48.997
There are some round these parts

29:49.122 --> 29:51.166
say he's not right in the head.

29:51.291 --> 29:52.417
Really?

29:52.543 --> 29:55.504
Only yesterday, Mr. Thorn,
the blacksmith,

29:55.629 --> 29:59.049
had a most nasty experience
with the Doctor

29:59.174 --> 30:01.009
because of those thieving gypsies

30:01.134 --> 30:03.428
who are camped in the grounds.

30:03.554 --> 30:06.139
Oh, yes, we've heard about the gypsies

30:06.265 --> 30:07.307
and the leopard.

30:07.432 --> 30:09.268
The story goes,

30:09.351 --> 30:11.770
the Doctor threw Mr. Thorn
in the stream

30:11.854 --> 30:13.939
in a fit of uncontrollable temper.

30:14.064 --> 30:15.816
And that Thorn, he's not a small man.

30:15.941 --> 30:19.778
Good Lord, is he bringing a
charge of assault?

30:19.903 --> 30:22.114
He was going to, but Miss Stoner,

30:22.197 --> 30:24.533
the Doctor's young stepdaughter,

30:24.658 --> 30:28.620
paid him some of her own money
to keep it quiet.

30:28.745 --> 30:30.247
Well, that's what I heard.

30:30.372 --> 30:33.083
Well, I never.

30:33.167 --> 30:34.835
Did you hear that, Holmes,

30:34.960 --> 30:36.962
the more I see and hear of
that young lady,

30:37.087 --> 30:39.631
the more my admiration increases,

30:39.756 --> 30:42.843
young woman of commendable spirit.

30:42.968 --> 30:45.929
You can pull up here, driver.

30:46.054 --> 30:48.473
Who do you mean?

30:48.557 --> 30:50.809
Well, Miss Stoner, of course,

30:50.893 --> 30:52.603
most admirable.

30:52.686 --> 30:54.646
Ah, Miss Stoner.

31:18.545 --> 31:20.005
Everything worked splendidly.

31:20.130 --> 31:21.381
Dr. Roylott has gone to London

31:21.507 --> 31:23.300
and he won't be back
before the evening.

31:23.383 --> 31:24.927
But we have already had the pleasure

31:25.052 --> 31:26.887
of Dr. Roylott's acquaintance.

31:27.012 --> 31:28.388
Goodness, he followed me?

31:28.514 --> 31:30.891
Yes, he turned up just after you left,

31:31.016 --> 31:33.977
but Holmes sent him off with
a flea in his ear.

31:34.061 --> 31:35.521
He's so cunning, I never know

31:35.604 --> 31:37.523
when I'm safe from him.

31:37.648 --> 31:39.650
Well then, he must guard himself,

31:39.733 --> 31:41.693
or he may find someone more cunning

31:41.818 --> 31:43.529
than himself upon his track, shall we.

31:43.612 --> 31:46.698
Holmes, don't you think we ought to get

31:46.824 --> 31:48.909
Miss Stoner away from here tonight?

31:49.034 --> 31:50.118
And arouse suspicion?

31:50.244 --> 31:51.537
But if he's violent ...

31:51.620 --> 31:53.539
We shall be here.

32:11.557 --> 32:14.309
So this is Dr. Roylott's room,

32:14.434 --> 32:16.353
this formerly your sister's,

32:16.436 --> 32:17.813
and this your room?

32:17.938 --> 32:19.857
Yes, I am now sleeping in this one.

32:19.940 --> 32:23.360
Ah, pending the alterations.

32:23.443 --> 32:26.071
Miss Stoner, may I ask something,

32:26.196 --> 32:27.656
that's unusual, isn't it,

32:27.781 --> 32:30.325
bedrooms on the ground floor?

32:30.450 --> 32:31.743
The bedrooms were moved downstairs

32:31.827 --> 32:33.370
when so much of the house
fell into decay.

32:33.495 --> 32:36.665
Oh, yes, of course, how sad.

32:40.794 --> 32:42.588
There seems little need for repairs

32:42.713 --> 32:44.381
to this end of the house.

32:44.464 --> 32:46.133
There are none, I believe it

32:46.258 --> 32:49.720
was an excuse to move me from my room.

32:49.803 --> 32:54.474
Ah, that is suggestive.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.518
Miss Stoner, would you be so kind

32:56.643 --> 32:58.270
as to go into the room

32:58.395 --> 33:00.022
in which you are now sleeping

33:00.147 --> 33:03.066
and bolt the shutters.

33:14.453 --> 33:18.040
What are you doing, Watson?

33:18.165 --> 33:21.543
Well, I'm using your methods, Holmes,

33:21.668 --> 33:25.214
seeing whether the ground
has been disturbed.

33:25.339 --> 33:28.467
And what have you come up with?

33:28.592 --> 33:31.345
Your footprints, I believe,

33:31.470 --> 33:34.431
and mine and Miss Stoner's,

33:34.556 --> 33:36.391
and this.

34:01.875 --> 34:07.548
No one could pass these
if they were bolted.

34:07.673 --> 34:13.011
Well, let's see if the inside throws
any light on the matter.

34:56.847 --> 34:59.474
Where does that bell
communicate with?

34:59.600 --> 35:01.393
It goes to the housekeeper's room.

35:01.518 --> 35:03.770
It looks newer than the other things.

35:03.896 --> 35:06.356
Yes, it was only put there
a couple of years ago.

35:06.440 --> 35:08.025
Ah, your sister asked for it?

35:08.108 --> 35:09.484
I never heard of her using it.

35:09.610 --> 35:13.071
We used to get what we wanted
for ourselves.

35:13.197 --> 35:14.948
Indeed, you will excuse me

35:15.073 --> 35:18.160
while I satisfy myself as to this floor.

35:39.181 --> 35:41.433
It doesn't ring.

35:41.517 --> 35:44.144
That's very strange.

35:57.157 --> 36:02.412
A ventilator into another room.

36:02.496 --> 36:06.291
You mean, when it might have

36:06.416 --> 36:09.419
communicated with the outside air?

36:09.503 --> 36:11.171
That is also quite modern.

36:11.296 --> 36:13.423
Indeed.

36:13.507 --> 36:15.968
Miss Stoner, with your permission,

36:16.093 --> 36:17.803
we will now carry our research

36:17.928 --> 36:20.681
to Dr. Roylott's chamber.

36:42.536 --> 36:44.163
What's in here?

36:44.288 --> 36:45.914
My stepfather's business papers.

36:46.039 --> 36:47.666
Ah, you've seen inside it, then?

36:47.749 --> 36:49.209
Only once, some years ago.

36:49.334 --> 36:52.963
I remember it was full of papers.

36:53.046 --> 36:55.841
Is there a cat in there?

36:55.966 --> 36:59.511
No, what a strange idea.

36:59.636 --> 37:04.474
Well, look at this!

37:04.558 --> 37:06.810
No, we don't keep a cat.

37:06.894 --> 37:11.732
Ah, well, a leopard is a large cat,
after all.

37:11.857 --> 37:13.525
Yes, but a saucer of milk
wouldn't go far

37:13.650 --> 37:19.239
in satisfying a leopard.

37:19.364 --> 37:22.784
The leopard is kept on a leash, is it?

37:22.910 --> 37:27.247
This sort of leash, Watson?

37:27.372 --> 37:29.541
What do you make of it?

37:29.625 --> 37:31.668
Well, it's a common enough dog leash,

37:31.752 --> 37:35.839
but I don't know why it should be tied.

37:35.964 --> 37:40.135
We have no dog.

37:40.260 --> 37:46.600
Thank you, Miss Stoner,
I have seen enough.

38:04.993 --> 38:10.332
I was going to ask if
he'd like some tea.

38:10.415 --> 38:14.586
Miss Stoner, it is very essential

38:14.711 --> 38:18.215
that you absolutely follow
my advice in every respect.

38:18.340 --> 38:20.551
Your life may depend on it.

38:20.634 --> 38:22.886
I assure you that I'm in your hands.

38:22.970 --> 38:24.763
In the first place,

38:24.847 --> 38:27.516
on the way here we passed
a small cottage.

38:27.599 --> 38:28.934
The shill house.

38:29.059 --> 38:30.602
Will the windows of your sister's room

38:30.727 --> 38:32.229
be visible from there?

38:32.354 --> 38:33.313
Yes.

38:33.438 --> 38:34.523
You are sure?

38:34.606 --> 38:36.024
Yes.

38:36.149 --> 38:38.610
Then we shall make it our base.

38:38.694 --> 38:40.279
Some refreshment?

38:40.404 --> 38:44.783
We shall have dine shalt we, Holmes?

38:44.867 --> 38:47.369
Is there a village inn?

38:47.452 --> 38:48.537
The Crown.

38:48.620 --> 38:49.746
Oh, good.

38:49.830 --> 38:52.791
Thank you all the same.

38:52.875 --> 38:55.169
Now, Miss Stoner,

38:55.294 --> 38:57.462
when your stepfather returns,

38:57.546 --> 38:59.756
you must confine yourself in your room

38:59.840 --> 39:02.092
on pretense of a headache.

39:02.176 --> 39:03.552
Then when you hear your stepfather

39:03.635 --> 39:05.179
retire for the night,

39:05.304 --> 39:06.763
you must go to the windows,

39:06.847 --> 39:09.224
undo the hasp, open the shutters,

39:09.349 --> 39:11.977
and leave your lamp on the window sill

39:12.060 --> 39:13.687
as a signal to us.

39:13.812 --> 39:16.023
Then withdraw with
anything you may want

39:16.148 --> 39:17.983
for the night to your old room.

39:18.108 --> 39:19.776
I have no doubt that,
in spite of the repairs,

39:19.860 --> 39:21.570
you could manage there for one night.

39:21.653 --> 39:24.281
Oh, yes, of course.

39:24.364 --> 39:26.533
And now, we must leave.

39:26.658 --> 39:29.703
If Dr. Roylott should return
and find us here,

39:29.828 --> 39:33.332
our journey would be in vain.

39:33.457 --> 39:34.791
I believe, Mr. Holmes,

39:34.875 --> 39:39.004
that you've already made up your mind.

39:39.129 --> 39:40.547
For pity sake,

39:40.547 --> 39:43.133
tell me the cause of my sister's death.

39:43.217 --> 39:44.885
Be brave.

39:45.010 --> 39:46.470
If you do as I have told you,

39:46.595 --> 39:48.013
rest assured we shall soon drive away

39:48.138 --> 39:52.643
the dangers that threaten you.

40:13.580 --> 40:17.501
Yes, it is a clear view.

40:35.769 --> 40:40.232
Are you expecting this
to take all night, Holmes?

40:40.357 --> 40:47.990
It's possible, anything's possible.

40:48.115 --> 40:52.369
When a doctor goes wrong,

40:52.452 --> 40:55.747
he is the first of criminals.

40:55.873 --> 41:00.460
He has nerve, he has knowledge,

41:00.586 --> 41:04.047
Palmer and Pritchard were among
the heads of their profession,

41:04.173 --> 41:09.136
this man strikes even deeper.

41:09.261 --> 41:14.725
I really have some scruples
taking you tonight.

41:14.850 --> 41:17.853
There is a distinct element of danger.

41:17.936 --> 41:22.983
If I can be of assistance?

41:23.108 --> 41:27.196
That's very kind of you.

41:35.370 --> 41:37.748
You evidently saw more in those rooms

41:37.831 --> 41:41.126
than was visible to me, Holmes.

41:41.210 --> 41:48.258
No, I probably deduced a little more.

41:48.383 --> 41:50.802
Do you remember Miss Stoner said

41:50.928 --> 41:52.513
that her sister could smell

41:52.638 --> 41:56.350
Dr. Roylott's cigar?

41:56.475 --> 41:57.851
Well?

41:57.976 --> 42:00.854
The ventilator, a ventilator made,

42:00.979 --> 42:06.193
a cord hung, and a woman
who lies in the bed, dies.

42:06.318 --> 42:08.946
I can't see any connection.

42:09.029 --> 42:16.370
Did you notice anything peculiar
about the bed?

42:16.495 --> 42:20.165
It was clamped to the floor.

42:20.290 --> 42:24.002
It could not be moved,
had to remain in the same

42:24.086 --> 42:30.008
relative position to
the ventilator and the rope,

42:30.133 --> 42:33.887
or so we may call it,
since it was clearly

42:34.012 --> 42:40.811
never made for a bell pull.

42:40.894 --> 42:45.732
I begin to see dimly
what you're driving at.

42:45.858 --> 42:48.610
We're only just in time to prevent some

42:48.694 --> 43:00.330
subtle and horrible crime.

43:08.881 --> 43:12.009
Whoah, boy.

43:19.850 --> 43:21.727
Goodnight.

44:12.110 --> 44:16.990
Did you have a good day?

44:17.115 --> 44:25.332
Not without interest.

44:25.457 --> 44:29.127
Where did you get to this morning?

44:29.253 --> 44:33.549
I decided to go to town, too.

44:33.674 --> 44:39.805
I had some shopping to do
for the wedding.

44:39.888 --> 44:42.933
You knew I was going up,

44:43.016 --> 44:46.979
we might have traveled together.

44:47.062 --> 44:49.815
I left early.

44:49.898 --> 44:53.986
Yes, I know you did.

44:54.111 --> 44:56.572
So that I should be back by lunchtime,

44:56.697 --> 45:01.326
I had some things to do here
this afternoon.

45:01.410 --> 45:07.958
My trip was a whim.

45:08.083 --> 45:17.050
You always were a good little liar.

45:17.176 --> 45:23.390
If you'll excuse me,
I have a terrible headache.

45:23.515 --> 45:30.939
Holmes, the meddler, Holmes,
the busybody,

45:31.023 --> 45:38.030
Holmes, the Scotland Yard
Jack-in-office.

46:13.482 --> 46:16.485
The signal.

46:48.600 --> 46:51.353
My God, what's that?

46:51.436 --> 46:53.814
It's the baboon.

46:53.939 --> 46:57.943
This is a nice household.

47:22.634 --> 47:27.598
We must sit without light.

47:49.536 --> 47:51.371
Do not fall asleep;

47:51.497 --> 47:55.959
your very life may depend upon it.

49:52.284 --> 49:54.745
You see it, Watson, you see it?

50:05.881 --> 50:10.802
What can it mean?

50:10.886 --> 50:13.805
It means it is over,

50:13.889 --> 50:16.808
and perhaps, for the best.

50:16.892 --> 50:20.646
Come Watson, bring your pistol.

50:36.745 --> 50:41.291
It's the band, the speckled band,

50:41.416 --> 50:43.669
it is a swamp adder,

50:43.752 --> 50:47.005
the deadliest snake in India.

50:47.089 --> 50:50.467
He has died within seconds
of being bitten.

51:35.596 --> 51:37.347
Violence does, in truth,

51:37.431 --> 51:39.933
recoil upon the violent,

51:40.058 --> 51:42.936
and the schemer falls into the pit

51:43.061 --> 51:45.481
which he digs for another.

51:48.567 --> 51:49.943
The idea of a snake occurred to me

51:50.068 --> 51:51.737
when I coupled it with the knowledge

51:51.862 --> 51:53.447
that the Doctor was furnished

51:53.572 --> 51:55.407
with a supply of creatures from India.

51:55.491 --> 51:57.951
A form of poison, rapid and lethal.

51:58.076 --> 51:59.411
Which couldn't possibly be discovered

51:59.495 --> 52:01.914
by any chemical test.

52:01.997 --> 52:04.041
It might, or might not bite

52:04.166 --> 52:05.959
the occupant of the bed.

52:06.084 --> 52:08.045
She might escape every night
for a week,

52:08.170 --> 52:09.713
but sooner or later,

52:09.796 --> 52:12.341
she must fall a victim.

52:12.424 --> 52:16.720
Oh, my poor Julia.

52:16.803 --> 52:19.515
The Doctor had trained the snake,

52:19.598 --> 52:21.183
probably with the milk,

52:21.266 --> 52:23.602
to return at the sound of a whistle,

52:23.727 --> 52:24.895
the very whistle

52:24.978 --> 52:28.065
which you and your late sister heard.

52:28.190 --> 52:29.483
My inspection of the chair

52:29.608 --> 52:31.276
in Dr. Roylott's room had shown that he

52:31.360 --> 52:33.195
had been in the habit of
standing upon it

52:33.278 --> 52:35.656
to reach the ventilator.

52:35.781 --> 52:37.533
Last night when I attacked the snake

52:37.616 --> 52:39.660
and drove it back
through the ventilator,

52:39.785 --> 52:41.620
I roused its snakish temper,

52:41.745 --> 52:43.330
causing it to turn upon

52:43.455 --> 52:45.874
the next person that it saw.

52:45.958 --> 52:49.211
Dr. Grimesby Roylott.

52:49.294 --> 52:51.129
So you, Holmes,

52:51.213 --> 52:52.798
were indirectly responsible

52:52.923 --> 52:55.801
for his death.

52:55.884 --> 52:58.136
I cannot say that it is likely

52:58.262 --> 53:02.266
to weigh very heavily on my conscience.
