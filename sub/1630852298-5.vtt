00:13.926 --> 00:16.580
When you talk about
a trauma trigger...

00:16.711 --> 00:19.106
I'm getting my mouth wired.

00:19.236 --> 00:20.932
Everyone thinks
I'm crazy to do this.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.586
...it is that house.

00:22.718 --> 00:23.980
I've made a decision.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.504
I'm going to terminate
the pregnancy.

00:26.635 --> 00:28.940
I get frustrated
because it's like,

00:29.071 --> 00:30.378
"Well, why did I come here

00:30.507 --> 00:32.075
"if we're not gonna
talk through stuff

00:32.206 --> 00:34.381
"and if people aren't gonna be
willing to address

00:34.512 --> 00:36.514
the things
that are bothering them?"

00:37.862 --> 00:40.604
Discussions we're having,
they're triggering me.

00:40.735 --> 00:41.737
- Kim...
- Mm-hmm.

00:41.866 --> 00:43.738
...I say she's my second wife.

00:43.868 --> 00:44.957
- Right. Right.
- We weren't legally married.

00:45.088 --> 00:46.524
She died.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.874
- Oh.
- When she died...

00:49.005 --> 00:50.093
love died.

00:50.223 --> 00:53.052
Losing her... was not easy.

00:53.182 --> 00:55.881
It's hard working through
the Kim stuff, though.

00:56.012 --> 00:58.841
He's giving
such small pieces and bits.

00:58.970 --> 01:02.149
I'm waiting for him
to share fully

01:02.278 --> 01:04.325
what, what's been happening.

01:04.454 --> 01:07.805
David? Do you mind just
not smoking weed at the table?

01:07.936 --> 01:12.114
My daughter told me to not
trust you and watch out for you,

01:12.245 --> 01:14.073
so leave me alone, please.

01:14.204 --> 01:15.510
- Hey, Karen...
- I just asked you nicely.

01:15.640 --> 01:16.989
Karen... Karen...
please leave me alone.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.426
- Okay.
- Thank you, Karen.

01:18.555 --> 01:20.079
You better speak up
for yourself, Beth.

01:20.210 --> 01:23.257
DAVID: What the fuck?!
What is wrong with y'all?!

01:23.387 --> 01:25.128
What is wrong with you?!

01:25.259 --> 01:28.522
Can we agree to just be kind
and cordial to one another?

01:28.652 --> 01:31.917
- Yeah.
- I think that we have
a real, true opportunity

01:32.048 --> 01:33.527
to make some amends.

01:33.658 --> 01:35.311
When you go downstairs,

Yup. For my daughter.

03:05.271 --> 03:06.925
I'm not a tattoo person.

03:07.056 --> 03:10.450
I don't have any tattoos...
except for that one, so...

03:10.580 --> 03:13.758
I mean, I love...
I really love the artwork

03:13.889 --> 03:16.544
- that goes into a lot
of tattoos,
- Yeah.

03:16.674 --> 03:18.719
and Kim had
some really nice stuff.

03:18.849 --> 03:20.722
Her whole body was covered
with tattoos.

03:20.852 --> 03:22.592
- Mm.
- I loved it.

03:22.723 --> 03:24.943
When my season
of The Real Worldwrapped,

03:25.074 --> 03:26.379
I was, uh, very relieved.

03:26.509 --> 03:28.772
I just wanted to move on
with my life.

03:28.903 --> 03:30.861
I wanted to move on from my band

03:30.992 --> 03:33.647
and live my life
in a regular job.

03:33.777 --> 03:36.824
I was married for 22 years.

03:36.954 --> 03:40.655
I stayed in a marriage
that was not healthy for me,

03:40.784 --> 03:42.918
and apparently it was
not healthy for my ex.

03:43.048 --> 03:45.180
I'm divorced.

03:45.312 --> 03:48.401
I have three children, who are
so amazing, they're so awesome,

03:48.531 --> 03:51.840
and I see myself
in every one of them.

03:51.969 --> 03:55.626
As I was going through
my divorce, I met Kimberly,

03:55.757 --> 03:59.325
and, um, she basically became
my second wife.

03:59.456 --> 04:01.152
We never legally got married,

04:01.283 --> 04:04.068
but we would call each other
husband and wife, you know?

04:04.199 --> 04:05.157
We kinda just hit it off.

04:05.288 --> 04:07.855
We jumped right into it.

04:07.985 --> 04:10.379
I was with Kimberly
for almost four years,

04:10.510 --> 04:15.080
and Kimberly passed
on September 8, 2019.

04:16.995 --> 04:20.651
To Kimberly, this was our symbol
of being married,

04:20.781 --> 04:22.697
our dedication
and our love for each other.

04:22.826 --> 04:24.394
I only did this for her,

04:24.524 --> 04:26.701
'cause this was never really
a tattoo to me.

04:26.831 --> 04:27.831
[chuckles]
You know?

04:27.963 --> 04:30.095
This was a symbol.

04:30.225 --> 04:31.793
The love I had with Kimberly

04:31.923 --> 04:33.968
was the culmination
of many, many years,

04:34.098 --> 04:38.800
and that type of love completely
died when Kimberly died.

04:38.930 --> 04:42.629
- Tattoos are forever, though.
- GLEN: I don't know.

04:42.759 --> 04:45.502
Glen deserves love
just as much as anyone else.

04:45.632 --> 04:49.071
His past
has been holding him hostage

04:49.201 --> 04:50.812
from the loss of his partner.

04:50.942 --> 04:56.295

to move forward with his life.

didn't already know by now,

05:51.480 --> 05:53.353
um, that I'm pregnant,

and, um, I just kinda wanted
everybody to know that I've

05:57.574 --> 06:01.055
made a decision that I'm going
to... terminate the pregnancy.

06:01.185 --> 06:05.668
Finding out that I was pregnant
was a big downer for me,

06:05.800 --> 06:07.322
because at this particular
point in time in my life,

06:07.454 --> 06:09.586
I'm, I'm not ready for kids.

06:09.716 --> 06:11.762
I think
that Tami's making a mistake.

06:11.893 --> 06:14.851
I consider myself to still be
a kid my... kid myself.

06:14.983 --> 06:17.288
I think she's, you know,
covering a mistake...

06:17.420 --> 06:20.031
by making another mistake.

06:20.161 --> 06:22.817
TAMI: I have talked in further
detail with my mom

06:22.947 --> 06:24.514
about my pregnancy termination,

06:24.644 --> 06:28.822
and she has accepted
that I made a mistake

06:28.952 --> 06:31.434
and, to her and to me,
I'm making the right decision

06:31.564 --> 06:34.437
about rectifying it.

06:36.918 --> 06:40.312
- You okay? Hmm?
- No. I'm sick.

NADINE: Here. You gotta sit up

I was in excruciating pain,

06:48.146 --> 06:51.322
throwing up a lot,
bleeding heavily,

06:51.454 --> 06:53.500
and I thought instantly

06:53.629 --> 06:55.805
that maybe I had made
the wrong decision

06:55.937 --> 06:57.894
and I was being
punished for it.

06:58.026 --> 07:03.726
Um... and then I had to come
to grips with my decision

07:03.858 --> 07:05.815
and realize that it was
the best decision for me

07:05.947 --> 07:08.122
at this point in time
in my life.

07:08.252 --> 07:14.564
And after the pain came the
guilt and the hurt of it all.

07:14.694 --> 07:17.088
- [Tami sniffling]
- I'm sorry, babe, I'm sorry.

07:17.218 --> 07:18.220

to find myself,

07:27.795 --> 07:30.798

it wasn't the right time

you really are,

that you could go to

and talk with your mother
about this...

07:43.158 --> 07:44.463

07:51.819 --> 07:53.211

07:53.341 --> 07:54.778
- Yeah.
- ...and I felt that was

07:54.908 --> 07:56.649
the right decision for my life
at the time...

07:56.779 --> 07:58.564
- Mm-hmm.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.714
Each day

08:18.846 --> 08:21.978

08:22.110 --> 08:26.026
I, um...
have a very lovely daughter.

08:26.156 --> 08:30.031
Um, we... have shared
some wonderful experiences,

08:30.161 --> 08:32.599
and we've shared
some terrible times,

08:32.729 --> 08:36.777
and she has made me
who I am today.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.518
MAN: Do you think you could have
talked Tami out of this?

08:38.648 --> 08:40.519
Or would you have wanted to?

08:40.649 --> 08:44.697
I don't think I could have
talked Tami out of her choice.

08:44.827 --> 08:46.874
Um, I've never been
the type of parent

08:47.004 --> 08:50.006
that tried to make her
do things.

08:50.138 --> 08:53.402
I've always been supportive in
things that she wanted to do.

08:58.014 --> 08:58.928
I'm me.

08:59.059 --> 09:00.191
I, I'm not fake for anybody.

09:00.322 --> 09:02.019
I'm, I'm me.

09:02.149 --> 09:04.500
I can't force her
to have a child.

09:04.630 --> 09:07.590
I would not want her to bring
a child into this world

09:07.721 --> 09:11.985
that she did not first want,
she felt she wasn't ready for,

09:12.115 --> 09:16.033
so the decision that she chose,
it's okay with me.

09:16.163 --> 09:18.253
JON: I want to say two things
to you.

09:18.383 --> 09:21.298
I'm really choked up
right now.

09:21.429 --> 09:23.432
First... first, I'm choked up

09:23.562 --> 09:29.307
because I went to dinner
with you and your mom...

09:29.437 --> 09:31.658
and she was such a great lady.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.442
In the Deep South,
they take the cornbread

09:33.572 --> 09:35.486
and they mix it up
in the greens...

09:35.618 --> 09:37.097
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and then they eat it
with their fingers.

09:37.227 --> 09:38.926
They really do.

09:39.056 --> 09:42.972
Then I see the pain... that you,
uh... are feeling watching that,

09:43.104 --> 09:45.235
having lost her, and it's been
less than three years

09:45.366 --> 09:46.846
since my dad passed, so...

09:46.976 --> 09:49.631
- Yeah... yeah.
- [sniffles]

09:49.763 --> 09:51.591
And, um...

09:51.721 --> 09:54.331
But separate
from that emotion...

09:54.462 --> 09:58.466
I still feel the same way that
I did back then about the issue.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.908
I don't feel bad in any way, and
that's why I wanted to show it.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.996
The, the motive
behind showing it

10:07.128 --> 10:11.523
was just to teach people
that this could be a decision

10:11.653 --> 10:16.789
that you're faced with, and
what a lot of people don't know

10:16.919 --> 10:21.881
is they chose
not to film the second day,

10:22.011 --> 10:25.407
because there were
complications,

10:25.537 --> 10:27.104
and I was actually having twins.

10:27.235 --> 10:30.280
[gasps]

10:30.412 --> 10:32.283
- I had to go back...
- Oh, my gosh, Tami,
I'm so sorry.

10:32.413 --> 10:35.068
...and they felt that was
a little too heavy...

10:35.198 --> 10:37.245
- Yeah.
- that that was a little
too heavy for the time.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.289
Yeah.

10:39.421 --> 10:43.163
IRENE: Well, there's something
I want to share with you.

10:43.293 --> 10:46.863
I too had an abortion
before I came onto the show.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.952
- Mm-hmm.
- I at first made the decision

10:50.084 --> 10:51.432
that I was going to
keep the baby...

10:51.562 --> 10:56.394
- Mm-hmm...
- ...and I was
23 at the time?

10:56.524 --> 11:00.876
- Mm-hmm.
- And I kept on playing
the scenario over in my head

11:01.008 --> 11:04.489
with this person who I was
gonna have this baby with,

11:04.620 --> 11:06.577
and I thought,
"No, this isn't the man

11:06.708 --> 11:08.580
that I want to be the father
to my children."

11:08.711 --> 11:10.538
TAMI: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

11:10.669 --> 11:13.019
[tearfully]
Just the other day,
I finally told my mom

11:13.149 --> 11:17.501
for the first time
that I did abort it.

11:20.722 --> 11:23.465
[tearfully]
For me personally, it was, like,

11:23.595 --> 11:25.989
the hardest decision
I ever made.

11:26.120 --> 11:29.123
When I, you know...
young and in Hollywood,

11:29.253 --> 11:31.821
and I was dating a,
a really well-known actor

11:31.951 --> 11:35.085
and I got pregnant,
and I was like...

11:35.216 --> 11:37.434
"This is gonna get really
complicated really fast,

11:37.566 --> 11:40.003
"and I don't... I don't wanna
have to be connected

11:40.134 --> 11:42.701
to someone
who may not want this."

11:42.831 --> 11:46.443
And I know I did
the right thing because...

11:46.575 --> 11:48.533
I would still be
entangled with him...

11:48.663 --> 11:51.361
- Yup.
- ...and it, and it
might not have been healthy.

11:51.493 --> 11:56.236
IRENE: I had an abortion,
Tami had one, Beth A had one.

11:56.366 --> 11:59.674
There were three girls
in that house that had one.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.503
In the long run,
it doesn't shock me,

12:01.633 --> 12:04.548
because we're women that... back
then, we knew what we wanted,

12:04.679 --> 12:06.246
even though we were young,

12:06.376 --> 12:10.773
so I consider all three of us
very strong women...

12:10.903 --> 12:12.948
to have to go through
something like that.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.908
TAMI: I know when I announced it
to the house...

12:21.261 --> 12:22.306
...I felt alone.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.744
Mm-hmm.

12:24.874 --> 12:28.399
So to hear you ladies today say,

12:28.529 --> 12:31.576
"Hmm, no,
I went through it too,"

12:31.706 --> 12:33.534
I think that
would have been nice.

12:33.664 --> 12:36.364
[tearfully]
I had so much shame...

12:36.494 --> 12:40.106
you know, and each one of us
has our own experience,

12:40.236 --> 12:42.673
and maybe it's I wasn't able to
forgive myself in that moment.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.284
Maybe that's the truth.

12:44.414 --> 12:47.288
IRENE: I should have
had a conversation...

12:47.418 --> 12:49.551
'cause I was just too ashamed
at the time...

12:49.681 --> 12:51.857
'cause I was Catholic--

12:51.988 --> 12:53.990
you know, I did
go to church back then--

12:54.120 --> 12:57.080
- and when I saw you go
through this pain
- Mm-hmm.

12:57.211 --> 12:59.648
and, and I apologize,
because I thought

12:59.778 --> 13:02.302
maybe I could have added
a little comfort...

13:02.432 --> 13:04.434
because I knew
what you were going through.

13:04.566 --> 13:07.481
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. You don't
need to apologize for that.

13:07.611 --> 13:11.833
But I, I do for me, because
I wanted to be there for you.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.619
Thank you.
Thank you.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.970
That was a horrible experience.
It was very traumatic.

13:17.100 --> 13:20.711
It was not easy,
and you did it on television,

13:20.842 --> 13:23.541
on a show that was brand-new
to heavy topics,

13:23.672 --> 13:26.456
and introducing it to a world
that just wasn't doing that,

13:26.587 --> 13:28.371
it was brave.

13:28.503 --> 13:29.634
I'm pro-life,
I've always been pro-life,

13:29.764 --> 13:31.767
I'm adamantly pro-life.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.551
I'm against abortion, and, uh,

13:33.682 --> 13:35.770
I don't think there's any way
I'll ever agree with it.

13:35.902 --> 13:38.164
Everybody's like, you see these
T-shirts, "Save the whales,"

13:38.294 --> 13:41.254
"Save the trees,"
but kill the babies?

13:41.384 --> 13:44.039
What is this country? It makes
me sick to my stomach to,

13:44.171 --> 13:46.476
to think that,
that little babies are being...

13:46.607 --> 13:48.043
You think it's easy
for someone to go through that?

13:48.174 --> 13:50.177
I didn't say it was easy,
I'm saying it's wrong!

13:50.307 --> 13:51.438
You're saying,
"It makes me sick to my stomach

13:51.568 --> 13:52.788
to think about that."

13:52.918 --> 13:53.701
JON:
My roommates are looking

13:53.832 --> 13:55.312
at evangelical Christian.

13:55.442 --> 13:56.748
They know that about me,

13:56.879 --> 13:58.663
they know that I'm
very, very pro-life.

13:58.793 --> 14:01.535
But this time, what I don't
want to express to them

14:01.666 --> 14:04.321
is judgment and hatefulness
coming from somebody

14:04.451 --> 14:05.626
that has a different opinion.

14:05.756 --> 14:07.368
I didn't love the predicament,

14:07.498 --> 14:10.413
and I didn't really love
your decision, but I love you,

14:10.544 --> 14:13.721
and I love you, and I love you,
and I love you.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.679
Life is ups and downs.

14:15.811 --> 14:18.248
Life is nothing but good
and bad decisions by all of us.

14:18.379 --> 14:21.424
If people in the world
took your approach,

14:21.556 --> 14:24.298
with allowing people
to have their choice

14:24.427 --> 14:27.388
and make their decisions,
but still loving them

14:27.518 --> 14:30.259
and supporting them through
whatever that decision is,

14:30.390 --> 14:33.307
in spite of what they may feel
about something,

14:33.437 --> 14:36.788
the world as a whole
would be a better place.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.528
I feel like I did
what was best for me,

14:38.659 --> 14:42.010
and here we are today,
still talking about abortion,

14:42.142 --> 14:44.187
and men dictating...
trying to dictate

14:44.317 --> 14:46.450
- what a woman can do
with her body,
- Right.

14:46.581 --> 14:49.409
when this was already settled
with Roe v. Wade.

14:49.539 --> 14:51.499
The things
that are happening right now

14:51.629 --> 14:54.763
have been happening in our
country for a very long time.

14:54.894 --> 14:58.679
WOMAN OVER SPEAKERS: We will
not let the Supreme Court have

14:58.809 --> 15:05.251
the last word about our lives,
our bodies and our freedom.

15:05.381 --> 15:07.210
[crowd chanting]

15:07.341 --> 15:08.951
- How do we do it?
- Stand up! Fight back!

15:09.081 --> 15:10.778
- And what?
- Fight back!

15:10.909 --> 15:14.826
- [drumming]
- CROWD: Abortion matters
for all of us!

15:14.956 --> 15:17.654
The bottom line is, no matter
what background we come from,

15:17.786 --> 15:20.135
we should have a right to choose

15:20.267 --> 15:21.921
whether we're going to
have a child or not.

15:22.051 --> 15:27.230
So me making that decision then
was very liberating for me,

15:27.360 --> 15:29.884
controlling my own narrative
and my own destiny.

15:30.015 --> 15:32.322
I have two beautiful daughters.

15:32.452 --> 15:35.629
I got what I wanted,
but at the right time

15:35.759 --> 15:37.110
- for me to have it.
- Right.

15:39.938 --> 15:41.027
I'm glad we keep it light
in this house.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.724
- Yeah.
- [laughter]

15:42.854 --> 15:44.421
- Especially in the mornings.
- Yeah...

15:44.552 --> 15:45.945
- IRENE: Way to start a day.
- Way to start a morning.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.206
Yeah.

15:52.821 --> 15:55.692
BETH S: Tami...

15:55.823 --> 15:57.129
I didn't feel comfortable

15:57.259 --> 15:59.653
talking about that in there,
but, um...

15:59.783 --> 16:02.091
- You want to sit down?
- Yeah. [clears throat]

16:03.918 --> 16:09.706
Tami being brave enough to get
an abortion on TV, I mean, I...

16:09.837 --> 16:13.232
I commend her for being able
to share her story,

16:13.363 --> 16:16.932
'cause that's such a tough thing
to do in 2021,

16:17.062 --> 16:20.109
and she was doing it in 1993.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.111
Um...

16:25.245 --> 16:26.768
Ooh, um...

16:26.898 --> 16:30.990
When I was 19, I fell in love,

16:31.120 --> 16:34.167
and I waited
for the first time to have sex,

16:34.297 --> 16:37.952
and the first time that I
had sex, I got pregnant.

16:38.084 --> 16:40.738
And you had an abortion.

16:50.182 --> 16:53.707
I had somebody that I was with
that I loved...

16:53.837 --> 16:56.971
- and, um, he was a great
support system.
- Mm-hmm.

16:57.102 --> 16:59.931
-It was a very mutual
decision
- Mm-hmm.

17:00.062 --> 17:03.630
- to... not have the baby.
- Have the baby.

17:03.760 --> 17:08.243
The whole vibe in the room was
just, like, really off for me,

17:08.375 --> 17:11.073
so I went outside
and spoke to Tami,

17:11.203 --> 17:13.423
and felt more comfortable just,
like, talking to her about it

17:13.554 --> 17:16.904
one-on-one than, like,
in front of everybody.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.864
At the time, I couldn't talk
to my mother about it...

17:19.994 --> 17:21.865
- Why not?
- ...so you were lucky

17:21.997 --> 17:23.172
that you had a mom that you
could talk to about it.

17:23.303 --> 17:24.565
I, I just, I just couldn't.

17:24.694 --> 17:25.869
You just didn't feel
comfortable.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.307
No... no.
I mean, today I can...

17:28.438 --> 17:30.483
- Right.
- ...but back then
I couldn't do it.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.573
Mm-hmm.
Well, to that I say this.

17:32.702 --> 17:35.315
My mother was just
the best person...

17:35.444 --> 17:38.230
- Yeah.
- ...and very understanding,

17:38.361 --> 17:40.493
and it was a road
she had already lived,

17:40.624 --> 17:43.539
being young and pregnant.

17:43.671 --> 17:47.282
Her... situation went one way
and mine was going this way...

17:47.413 --> 17:49.415
- Yeah.
- ...and I think that's why
she was able to understand.

17:49.546 --> 17:50.981
'Cause she was very good

17:51.113 --> 17:52.635
about stepping
into somebody else's shoes.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.508
- Mm-hmm.
- And I feel like every child

17:54.637 --> 17:57.250
should be able to talk to
their parents about anything.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.773
- Yeah.
- That's the one person that--

17:59.903 --> 18:01.297
you know what I mean?--
is gonna be there for you

18:01.428 --> 18:03.256
- no matter what, so...
- Yeah.

18:03.385 --> 18:05.736
Tami's obviously
made up her mind.

18:05.866 --> 18:07.173
I have a different opinion,

18:07.303 --> 18:09.174
but by me telling her that
day in, day out,

18:09.305 --> 18:11.176
that's not gonna help matters.

18:11.307 --> 18:14.962
If I were to get pregnant right
now... I would get an abortion.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.008
I don't see anything against
what she's doing,

18:17.138 --> 18:18.575
although, you know, there are
some people in the house

18:18.705 --> 18:20.576
that have a different opinion,

18:20.708 --> 18:25.059
but I think everything will
work out as long as everybody...

18:25.191 --> 18:27.671
can respect Tami
for her decision.

18:27.801 --> 18:30.152
At least, you know,
in some strange way,

18:30.282 --> 18:34.242
I'm like, "Okay, so we've
all lived the same moment."

18:34.374 --> 18:36.375
- Yeah. Different ways.
- It's just weird that...

18:36.506 --> 18:38.421
- In different ways.
- I'm finding out
27 years later...

18:38.551 --> 18:40.989
- Yeah, I know. [laughing]
- But... [laughing]

18:41.119 --> 18:43.512
- In different ways. Yeah.
- But, hey.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.689
- Yeah... yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

18:45.819 --> 18:48.605
The irony of you in particular

18:48.736 --> 18:51.130
saying that you thought
I was fake...

18:51.259 --> 18:55.221
As far as Tami's concerned,
she's so fake and superficial.

18:55.351 --> 18:59.528
...when you were not being
honest to me, I feel now,

18:59.660 --> 19:02.663
the entire time you were
in the house in '93.

19:02.792 --> 19:05.448
And you could have said it
on the couch,

19:05.578 --> 19:07.667
because the cameras
followed you to the patio.

19:07.798 --> 19:11.453
I want to do something
that ain't gonna make me cry.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.804
[laughing]
I know, right?

19:13.934 --> 19:15.849
Y'all messin' up my street cred.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.112
- Oh, my God...
- Fuckin' with y'all...

19:17.242 --> 19:20.159
[both laughing]

19:25.424 --> 19:29.079
Whew! All right. Jesus.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.038
Keep this up,
it's gonna be nap time.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.085
That's what I'm saying, 'cause
I'm still low-key kinda sleepy.

19:34.215 --> 19:36.131
- [chime]
- FEMALE VOICE:
Incoming message.

19:36.261 --> 19:37.567
- Here we go.
- What the fuck?

19:37.698 --> 19:39.047
Incoming message.

19:39.177 --> 19:41.092
- Another one?
- You got everything?

19:41.222 --> 19:42.572
Yeah.

19:42.702 --> 19:44.356
- Incoming message.
- Oh...

19:44.487 --> 19:46.228
I still haven't made coffee.

19:46.358 --> 19:48.098
- For fuck's sake...
- [laughs]

19:48.230 --> 19:50.057
How many...
if this incoming message

19:50.189 --> 19:53.583
is that we're going hiking
after this, I swear...

19:53.713 --> 19:56.542
[sighs] Please be something
light and fun.

19:56.673 --> 19:58.108
JON: Beth Anthony!

19:58.240 --> 20:02.113
[laughter]

20:02.243 --> 20:03.680
Okay.

20:03.810 --> 20:06.029
- Incoming message.
- Incoming message!

20:06.161 --> 20:07.380
Bring it on, baby, bring it on.

20:07.509 --> 20:09.817
- JON: Oh, no...
- TAMI: Shut up!

20:09.946 --> 20:13.167
"In 1993,
your experience in Joshua Tree

20:13.298 --> 20:15.257
wasn't all that great."

20:15.387 --> 20:17.999
- JON: No, it wasn't.
- BETH S: "So it's time
for a Take 2..."

20:18.128 --> 20:20.174
- TAMI: No... no...
- "...to enjoy
the desert sun..."

20:20.306 --> 20:22.829

we're going there.
- No...

20:22.960 --> 20:24.266

20:24.396 --> 20:26.486
- and sleep in accommodations
- No...

20:26.615 --> 20:29.792
"where you won't have to cuddle
with one another to stay dry

20:29.923 --> 20:31.838
from the desert rain."

20:31.969 --> 20:33.449
Whoo...!

20:33.579 --> 20:39.586
My memories of that place in '93
are so deep-rooted...

20:39.715 --> 20:42.980
This weekend, we're going on
an Outward Bound excursion...

20:43.111 --> 20:46.506
I was in a tent...
in the trenches...

20:46.635 --> 20:50.683
with my shit... in a bag.

20:50.814 --> 20:52.816
You guys, wait!

20:52.947 --> 20:55.210
Our guide, Cheryl, did not know
where she was taking us.

20:55.340 --> 20:57.517
Ow. Ow! Ow!

20:57.646 --> 20:59.779
It's just so much shit
with Joshua Tree

20:59.910 --> 21:01.520
that I'm just not interested,

21:01.651 --> 21:03.261
and when you have someone

21:03.392 --> 21:06.394
who has legitimately lived
on the street,

21:06.526 --> 21:10.007
that experience, for me,
was traumatic.

21:10.137 --> 21:11.791
MAN: If you were
to step over that edge,

21:11.922 --> 21:13.794
life as you know it
would cease to happen.

21:13.923 --> 21:15.535
Let's tilt it just a little bit.

21:15.664 --> 21:17.884
[women screaming]

21:18.015 --> 21:19.886
That's not me
having a good time.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.410
"Get ready for this journey,

21:21.540 --> 21:22.846
as it might be
a life-changing experience."

21:22.977 --> 21:24.239
IRENE: Uh-oh.

21:25.632 --> 21:26.588
[laughter]

21:26.720 --> 21:28.461
What does this hashtag mean?

21:28.590 --> 21:29.505
What is that?

21:29.635 --> 21:32.900
- "Namaste."
- Whoo!

21:33.029 --> 21:35.468
- JON: That's it, I'm excited.
- TAMI: That's it:
"Nah, I'ma stay."

21:40.429 --> 21:41.517
JON: Wow.

21:41.647 --> 21:42.865
I hope that this time

21:42.997 --> 21:44.693
it's nothing like our last one.

21:44.825 --> 21:47.740
Our last one was in the heat,
we got lost in the desert.

21:47.871 --> 21:49.481
I don't know
where we think we're going.

21:49.612 --> 21:52.093

big rocks and things.

21:52.222 --> 21:53.876
AARON: It's 2:00
and we haven't eaten breakfast.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.749
JON: We had guides
that weren't helpful.

21:55.878 --> 21:58.142
AARON: You guys need to make
a choice right what you want,

21:58.272 --> 22:00.362
'cause you guys
are pissin' right now.

22:00.492 --> 22:02.232
DOMINIC: I don't think
there was one happy person.

22:02.364 --> 22:06.019
Everyone was disappointed
or upset over something.

22:06.150 --> 22:07.847
- IRENE: 30 minutes to pack.
- BETH A: 30 minutes?

22:07.978 --> 22:09.893
- 30 minutes.
- Oh, my God,
30 minutes to pack?

22:10.023 --> 22:12.940
- GLEN: These are wrinkling,
but guess what?
- So are we.

22:13.069 --> 22:15.463
This is how men pack. [sniffing]

22:16.943 --> 22:19.294
Hmm. What to wear
to Joshua Tree?

22:19.424 --> 22:23.037
- Beth?!
- I'm coming!
Does Tami need help?

22:23.166 --> 22:25.952
They're doing another little
excursion-type of situation,

22:26.083 --> 22:28.738
it's a three-hour car ride,
I don't want to go.

22:28.868 --> 22:31.480
I did not have
a pleasurable experience

22:31.611 --> 22:33.263
the first time that I went.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.005
That place is a trigger for me.

the whole world my business.

22:43.144 --> 22:44.971
Good. Thanks.

22:45.102 --> 22:47.713
When things
are trauma triggers for me,

22:47.844 --> 22:50.499
I have learned that I've got to
say no to them.

22:50.630 --> 22:52.066
And what was wrong with Vegas?

22:52.195 --> 22:53.936
What was...
if you're gonna put me in a car

22:54.067 --> 22:56.896

let me go gamble or some shit.

22:57.027 --> 22:59.769
[Reggie laughing on phone]

23:05.862 --> 23:07.342
JON: What book is that?

23:07.472 --> 23:08.691
GLEN: It's the one that has
little readings each day,

23:08.821 --> 23:10.039
for morning and night.

23:12.781 --> 23:15.306
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:15.436 --> 23:20.181
Um... I want you guys to go
and have an amazing experience,

23:20.310 --> 23:23.270
and I feel like I would be
a Debbie Downer in that moment.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.577
- My last experience
at Joshua Tree
- GLEN: Yeah.

23:25.708 --> 23:27.144
- was a lot.
- I know.

23:27.275 --> 23:28.842
- Yeah.
- I don't want to do it.

23:28.971 --> 23:30.278
- Right.
- Okay?

23:30.409 --> 23:31.974
And that's just it.

23:32.105 --> 23:34.413
I would like to be able to go...

23:34.542 --> 23:38.416
to a nice little hotel
while you guys are away.

23:38.547 --> 23:43.073
I'm not going, and particularly
I don't want to go

23:43.203 --> 23:44.901
because I need some time to deal

23:45.031 --> 23:48.077
with my emotions
about my mother.

23:48.209 --> 23:50.993
When you guys come back,
I'll be here,

23:51.125 --> 23:52.343
and I want to hear all about it.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.214
- That sounds good.
- That's good.

23:54.345 --> 23:55.651
- You see what I'm saying?
- No problem.
- Yes.

23:55.781 --> 23:57.218
- Yeah, no problem.
- Absolutely.

23:57.347 --> 23:58.785
You know her reason
for not wanting to come

23:58.914 --> 24:01.090
is because it sucked for her
last time

24:01.221 --> 24:03.963
and she don't want to get
reminded of it and...

24:04.094 --> 24:07.009
her hair and nails
and all this bullshit.

24:07.141 --> 24:09.230
Bitch, you signed up
just like us.

24:09.359 --> 24:12.363

to come to fuckin' Joshua Tree.

24:14.234 --> 24:16.366
Well, I can't possibly go.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.065
[laughter]

24:18.194 --> 24:19.282
I can't go.

24:19.413 --> 24:21.547
All right, guys.

24:26.595 --> 24:30.556
I'm sad and I'm disappointed
that Tami is not going, okay?

24:30.685 --> 24:32.122
We all signed up for this,

24:32.252 --> 24:34.211

that participating in everything

24:34.342 --> 24:36.474
is an important thing.

IRENE: I'm looking forward
to this Outward Bound thing.

24:49.791 --> 24:52.229
For some reason, I think
wayward kids go on these things

24:52.359 --> 24:55.450
so they can learn how to be
responsible and mature.

24:55.580 --> 24:58.626
I hope it's not the same thing,
because I'm not a wayward kid,

into entertainment insanity.

27:13.544 --> 27:16.939

the footage of our homecoming,

27:17.069 --> 27:19.071

29:14.403 --> 29:16.450

Eric used to come to comedy
shows, you know, share drinks,

29:21.933 --> 29:23.239

outside The Real World,

29:23.369 --> 29:25.153

with the inner child,

was to sit in front
of a total stranger

that I'm guilty about,

31:18.006 --> 31:19.834

31:19.964 --> 31:23.445

of one word to sum it all up,

kept coming to me nonstop.

to "transformation."

they carry themselves,

- Uh-uh.

40:39.784 --> 40:41.221
How you doing?

40:41.351 --> 40:42.440
[laughter]

40:42.570 --> 40:43.570
Not even close, brother.

40:43.702 --> 40:44.572
Nice to meet you.

40:44.702 --> 40:46.094
Not even close.

40:46.226 --> 40:48.576
I feel really good
about what happened here

40:48.706 --> 40:50.186
in the last 24 hours.

40:50.317 --> 40:52.275
There's a big family here.

40:52.405 --> 40:54.668
30 seasons of this.

40:54.800 --> 41:00.806
It's very positive to help to
heal and transform and evolve,

41:00.936 --> 41:02.416
and that feels really good
in my heart.

41:02.547 --> 41:03.851
JON: Did that happen?

41:03.983 --> 41:05.766
IRENE: Yeah, that happened.

41:05.898 --> 41:07.987
Eric, Eric Nies was a,
was a huge gift.

41:08.117 --> 41:09.641
Oh, my gosh.

41:09.771 --> 41:12.034
- IRENE: It's been real.
- BETH S: Bye, Joshua Tree.

41:12.164 --> 41:16.081
♪ I would like to hold
my little hand ♪

41:16.211 --> 41:21.914
♪ And we will run, we will,
we will crawl, we will... ♪

41:23.132 --> 41:25.134
Guess who's back, bitches?

41:25.264 --> 41:28.311
[chuckles]
Home again. The door's locked.

41:28.442 --> 41:29.748
That door ain't been locked
in 30 years.

41:29.878 --> 41:31.052
And I'm opening it for you
this time.

41:31.184 --> 41:32.054
- Thank you.
- [both laugh]

41:32.184 --> 41:33.534
Shut up.

41:36.362 --> 41:37.364
BETH S: Tami!

41:37.494 --> 41:38.670
Hey!

41:38.800 --> 41:39.496
- Welcome home.
- Hi, gorgeous.

41:39.626 --> 41:40.759
TAMI: Hey, hey.

41:40.889 --> 41:42.891
- [laughs]
- You look rested.

41:43.021 --> 41:46.547
I am... very.

41:46.677 --> 41:49.202
Thank God.

41:49.331 --> 41:53.074
Coming back into the house,
I feel completely refreshed.

41:53.206 --> 41:57.079
I needed that time to myself
with my husband

41:57.210 --> 42:00.909
to get all of my tears out
and get back in the game.

42:01.039 --> 42:03.911
How are you guys doing?

42:04.043 --> 42:05.610
JON: We're great.
We missed you.

42:05.739 --> 42:07.001
It was much different
than our first Joshua Tree.

42:07.132 --> 42:09.003
Okay.

42:09.135 --> 42:12.094
First thing that happens,
we come through the gate and...

42:12.224 --> 42:14.226
Eric Nies is sitting there.

42:14.356 --> 42:16.097
- Oh, okay.
- [Jon laughs]

42:16.228 --> 42:18.099
You still think he's cute
and a heartthrob and all that?

42:18.231 --> 42:19.666
He's pretty cute.

42:19.797 --> 42:21.539
- You liked it.
- He's pretty cute. [laughs]

42:21.668 --> 42:23.583
You liked the eye candy,
I got it.

42:23.715 --> 42:25.847
- Yeah.
- I needed the one-day break

42:25.978 --> 42:27.849
of being the heartthrob hunk
on our season...

42:27.980 --> 42:29.242
- Uh-huh.
- ...so Eric stepped in.

42:29.371 --> 42:30.373
- Mm-hmm.
- I needed that.

42:30.503 --> 42:32.070
Gave you some time to yourself.

42:32.201 --> 42:34.594
Just a little bit of time
to stop being the sexy hunk.

42:34.726 --> 42:36.945
Did anything weird happen?

42:37.076 --> 42:40.034
Um, well, that's why,
that's why Glen has to tell you

42:40.166 --> 42:41.994
the story about the rat.

42:42.123 --> 42:44.561
- Did it have something
to do with him?
- It sure did.

42:44.692 --> 42:47.041
You might think I'm crazy,
but, like, Kim was there.

42:47.172 --> 42:49.001
- Mm...
- Yeah.

42:49.130 --> 42:51.525
But I was sitting there next to
Eric, and Glen is right here,

42:51.655 --> 42:52.918
and the rat's coming in and...

42:53.047 --> 42:55.702
it kissed Glen's finger.

42:55.833 --> 42:57.226
Oh, hell no.

42:57.356 --> 42:58.793
No, it was so cute.

42:58.923 --> 43:00.186
It was so cute.

43:00.315 --> 43:02.362
- Oh, girl, no.
- [laughs] So cute.

43:02.492 --> 43:04.016
Irene, you didn't scream?

43:04.146 --> 43:06.887
No, I didn't, it was ki...
it was so cute.

43:07.018 --> 43:09.237
Oh, God, I did everything
I could not to scream.

43:09.369 --> 43:11.023
It looked
like a little guinea pig.

43:11.152 --> 43:12.545
Oh, I don't like them either.

43:12.677 --> 43:14.940
- Okay.
- Oh, my gosh.

43:15.070 --> 43:16.418
Like, hamsters and shit
like that.

43:16.550 --> 43:17.985
Yeah, it reminded me
of a hamster.

43:19.987 --> 43:21.728
I think it's time.

43:21.860 --> 43:24.123
And I need to get closure
with Kimberly.

43:24.253 --> 43:27.213
I really didn't sleep, and then
suddenly it came to me.

43:27.342 --> 43:31.434
You know what? It's time
to get rid of my tattoo.

43:31.565 --> 43:33.219
This is not quite
what I envisioned

43:33.349 --> 43:35.090
when I said,
"Let's get tattoos."

43:35.221 --> 43:37.657
- We're going to
the laser place.
- [chuckles]

43:37.789 --> 43:41.096
Well, let's do this.

43:41.226 --> 43:43.358
I can't think of a better thing
to do this morning.

43:43.489 --> 43:45.447
I'm so proud of you.

43:45.579 --> 43:49.364
Starting the process
of removing this tattoo...

43:49.496 --> 43:50.802
I wouldn't miss it.

43:50.931 --> 43:53.456
And I'm grateful
that I'm a part of it.

43:55.849 --> 43:57.286
- Glen, we're doing this.
- MAN: I'm going to move you
over a little.

43:57.416 --> 43:59.070
Too-hoo!

43:59.201 --> 44:02.422
MAN:
One, two, three.

44:02.552 --> 44:07.295
This is symbolic
of moving on from his past

44:07.427 --> 44:09.603
that has been
holding him hostage

44:09.733 --> 44:11.605
from the loss of his partner.

44:11.735 --> 44:13.259
- MAN: That's it.
- BETH A: Thank you, you guys.

44:13.389 --> 44:14.476
- GLEN: That's it?
- That's it.

44:14.608 --> 44:16.001
- Nah. Really?
- I swear.

44:16.130 --> 44:18.612
He's finally able to make
eye contact with me.

44:18.742 --> 44:23.094
Because this whole process,
he's not looking me in the eyes,

44:23.224 --> 44:25.097
he's not going deep there
with me,

44:25.226 --> 44:27.925
'cause I think
he's afraid he's gonna lose it.

44:28.056 --> 44:29.014
- We appreciate it.
- And you, too.

44:29.143 --> 44:30.623
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

44:30.755 --> 44:33.018
That night at Joshua Tree,
something came to me

44:33.148 --> 44:35.934
that got me thinking
in a different way

44:36.063 --> 44:41.853
about my relationship and about
how I honor Kimberly's life.

44:41.983 --> 44:43.724
Kimberly's telling me,
"Don't worry about me.

44:43.855 --> 44:45.291
"I'm in a good place.

44:45.420 --> 44:47.161
You need to get
in that good place."

44:47.293 --> 44:48.860
BETH A:
How you feeling, rock star?

44:48.989 --> 44:52.427
- GLEN: Wow. Wow.
- [laughing] Done.

44:52.559 --> 44:54.561
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

44:59.914 --> 45:00.740
I really wanted to make it
in country music

45:00.871 --> 45:03.003
to make my dad proud...

45:03.135 --> 45:06.311
but country music careers
can fall apart really easily.

45:06.442 --> 45:08.530
Are you brave enough now
to put yourself out there?

45:08.661 --> 45:10.795
I haven't performed
in a long time.

45:10.925 --> 45:12.621
WOMAN:
Welcome back, Jon Brennan.

45:12.753 --> 45:15.320
I wanna dedicate this to my
roommates that are here tonight.

45:15.451 --> 45:17.452
[cheering and applause]

45:17.583 --> 45:20.021
"Will you mind if I hang up
a Confederate flag?"

45:20.152 --> 45:21.630
The most idiotic thing
I've ever said in my life.

45:21.762 --> 45:23.590
It's those
little elements of racism

45:23.721 --> 45:25.679
that live within all of us.

45:25.809 --> 45:26.853
We're playing fishbowl.

45:26.985 --> 45:27.724
- Oh, my...
- Shit, what?

45:27.855 --> 45:29.552
This is a can of worms.

45:29.682 --> 45:32.554
[tearfully]
I should have spoke up
and I didn't.

45:32.686 --> 45:34.166
Shame on me.

45:34.295 --> 45:36.603
Is there something wrong
with not seeing color?

45:36.733 --> 45:38.648
Yes! You need to see
some fucking color

45:38.778 --> 45:41.608
so you can understand what
I'm going through in America!
