[ALLISON] YOU'RE NERVOUS

08:54.070 --> 08:56.570

UNLESS THEY'RE, OF COURSE,
MEAT HEADS.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.700
[ALLISON] ELOQUENT.

09:01.750 --> 09:07.670
[JAKE] LET'S GO OUT. SERIOUSLY.

09:07.710 --> 09:10.300
[ALLISON] THAT'S IT?
THAT'S YOUR PITCH?

09:10.340 --> 09:11.380
[JAKE] YEAH.

09:11.420 --> 09:12.630
[ALLISON] DOES THAT USUALLY WORK
FOR YOU?

09:12.670 --> 09:13.840
[JAKE] NOPE.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.890
&lt;GIGGLES&gt;
[ALLISON] BUT YOU KEEP TRYING.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.930
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT.

09:21.810 --> 09:23.520
[JAKE] WHAT?

09:23.560 --> 09:25.480
[MAL] TAKE YOUR BALL
AND GO HOME, SON.
SHE'S OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.730
[JAKE] YOU KNOW, IT'S YOUR
CONSTANT SUPPORT THAT SEES
ME THROUGH THE TROUBLING TIMES.

09:28.770 --> 09:30.150
[MAL] I DO WHAT I CAN.

09:31.280 --> 09:34.320
ZERO CHANCE WITH THAT
LAWYER. ZERO.

09:34.360 --> 09:36.950
[JAKE] THOSE, UH, HOW TO
INSPIRE YOUR FAMILY TAPES,

09:36.990 --> 09:38.870
THEY'RE REALLY PAYING OFF.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.530
[MAL] NO HOPE.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.540
[KENT] THAT'S GOOD.
[PHOTOGRAPHER] YEAH.

09:47.330 --> 09:49.500
[KENT] BOX OFFICE DOESN'T OPEN
UNTIL NOON, FELLAS.

09:49.540 --> 09:51.800
[JAKE] WE WORK FOR J.J. MURPHY.

09:51.840 --> 09:55.550
THIS MALACHY, I'M JAKE DOYLE.
WE WERE HERE LAST NIGHT WHEN HE
HAD HIS LITTLE CLOWN INCIDENT.

09:55.590 --> 09:59.760
[KENT] RIGHT. BODYGUARDS.
I REMEMBER A TIME, YEARS AGO,

09:59.800 --> 10:02.810
WHEN J.J. ALMOST WET
HIMSELF AT THE SOUND OF
AN ICE CREAM TRUCK.

10:02.850 --> 10:04.810
&lt;CHUCKLING&gt;
[KENT] YEAH,

10:04.850 --> 10:09.610
CREEPY CLOWN INCIDENT.
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE,
BUT WHOEVER IT IS,

10:09.650 --> 10:11.610
I'M A HUGE FAN.

10:11.650 --> 10:16.280
[JAKE] REALLY? IT WOULDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH AN
OLD "CATFUD" GRUDGE, WOULD IT?

10:16.320 --> 10:18.160
[KENT] THAT WAS ANOTHER LIFE.

10:18.200 --> 10:22.660
[MAL] J.J. MAKES IT BIG.
YOU RUN A CLUB.
MIGHT MAKE A GUY A TAD BITTER?

10:22.700 --> 10:25.410
[KENT] I OWN THE CLUB.
HE'S PLAYIN' IT.

10:25.450 --> 10:26.830
WHAT GOES AROUND, COMES AROUND.

10:26.870 --> 10:30.420
[JAKE] AFTER J.J. BAILED
ON YOU, WHY DIDN'T YOU,
AND UH, RHONDA HERE,

10:30.460 --> 10:32.250
CARRY ON WITH THE TROOP?

10:32.290 --> 10:34.800
[MAL] SPEAKING OF RHONDA,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE WE MIGHT FIND HER?

10:34.840 --> 10:38.930
[KENT] NO. I HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN
YEARS. J.J.'S BIG COMEBACK,

10:38.970 --> 10:42.180
MAKES A SECOND FALL
THAT MUCH SWEETER.

10:46.140 --> 10:49.850
&lt;SHIP HORN HONKING&gt;

10:49.900 --> 10:51.650
[MAL] HEY, THAT'S THE CREEPY KID
WE SAW AT THE CLUB.

10:53.320 --> 10:57.700
[JAKE] SO IT IS. HEY, BUDDY.
DO YOU GOT A SEC?
I JUST NEED TO TALK...

10:58.900 --> 11:01.240
TO... YOU.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.290
&lt;♪&gt;

11:09.080 --> 11:18.470
[JAKE] HEY! KID! I THOUGHT YOU
WANTED TO MEET J.J. I CAN
INTRODUCE YOU IF YOU LIKE.

11:18.510 --> 11:25.510
HE'S A SWELL GUY. MAYBE I
CAN GET YOU AN AUTOGRAPH?

11:30.520 --> 11:32.860
[MAL] SO YOU LOST HIM, DID YA?
COULDA MADE THAT HAPPEN MYSELF.

11:32.900 --> 11:37.070
[JAKE] AH-HA-HA. LOOK
WHAT HE LEFT BEHIND.
VINTAGE J.J. MATERIAL.

11:37.110 --> 11:39.030
[MAL] HE MUSTA BEEN PRETTY
SCARED OFF TO LEAVE IT.

11:39.070 --> 11:43.030
[STAN] HEY, HEY, HEY LEAH! IS
THAT OUR GARBAGE?

11:43.070 --> 11:44.830
[LEAH] YOU GOT YOUR JOB, STAN,
I GOT MINE.

11:44.870 --> 11:49.870
[STAN] GET OUTA HERE! AND YOU,
YOU ARE SO FIRED.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.920
[MAL] I CAN SEE WHY THEY CALL IT
THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS.

11:54.880 --> 12:01.930
[J.J.] MORE, MORE, MORE.

12:01.970 --> 12:05.300
TOO MUCH! SCRAPE IT OFF.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.720
NOT WITH YOUR FINGER.

12:07.770 --> 12:13.690
LEAH JORDAN IS A BLOGGER.
LEAH'S LOWDOWN, NEED I SAY MORE?

12:13.730 --> 12:14.770
[MAL] WHAT WAS SHE LOOKING FOR?

12:14.810 --> 12:17.730
[J.J.] TYLER? JOKES? WHATTA YA
GOT?

12:17.780 --> 12:19.860
[TYLER] UH, AT DINNER, EVERYONE
AT MY HOUSE USED TO ASK FOR

12:19.900 --> 12:22.400
THE TURKEY LEG. DAD WOULD SAY,
"WHAT DO YOU THINK WE HAVE HERE?

12:22.450 --> 12:25.780
A SPIDER?"
&lt;CHUCKLING&gt;

12:25.820 --> 12:27.240
[J.J.] PASS.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.580
[TYLER] ONE TIME I WAS ON A
PLANE, ABOUT TO LAND--

12:29.620 --> 12:32.960
[J.J.] AWFUL, JUST AWFUL!
YOU'RE GETTING WORSE.
THEY'RE JUST TERRIBLE.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.790
GO OVER THERE
SOMEWHERE.

12:34.830 --> 12:36.750
[JAKE] HEY, DON RICKLES, FOCUS.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.750
WHY WAS LEAH JORDAN GOING
THROUGH YOUR TRASH?

12:38.800 --> 12:39.960
[J.J.] WELL, HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

12:40.010 --> 12:41.970
[STAN] I'M TELLING YA,
SHE'S YOUR STALKER.

12:42.010 --> 12:44.340
WHY WAIT FOR A STORY, WHEN
YOU COULD CREATE IT YOURSELF?

12:44.390 --> 12:45.720
IT'S HER WAY OF MAKING NEWS.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.760
[JAKE] YEAH? WHAT ABOUT
KENT AND RHONDA?

12:47.810 --> 12:49.770
[J.J.] OH,
THOSE TWO COMIC HACKS.
I CARRIED THEM FOR 5 YEARS,

12:49.810 --> 12:53.350
AND THEY HAVE A BEEF WITH ME?
THEY WERE LIKE LEECHES.
THEY WERE LIKE--

12:53.390 --> 12:56.440
[TYLER] LIKE LEECHES
DOCTORS WERE USING THEM
TO CURE INFECTION.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.980
[J.J.] YES, THAT'S NOT BAD.

12:59.020 --> 13:01.440
THAT'S, THAT'S GETTING THERE.

13:01.490 --> 13:04.490
&lt;COUGHING&gt;

13:10.040 --> 13:11.620
[STAN] WOAH, WOAH.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.670
[JAKE] HE'S STILL BREATHING.
TYLER, CALL AN AMBULANCE!

13:15.580 --> 13:17.840
&lt;♪&gt;

13:17.880 --> 13:20.590
[NIKKI] WE PUMPED HIS STOMACH,
AND WE'RE WAITING ON
THE LAB RESULTS.

13:20.630 --> 13:22.380
[JAKE] OKAY, WELL I'M PRETTY
SURE HE WAS POISONED.

13:22.420 --> 13:24.010
SO, IF YOU
FIND ANYTHING, LET ME KNOW.

13:24.050 --> 13:26.470
[NIKKI] IF I COULD TEST
THE FOOD HE WAS EATING,
THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.

13:26.510 --> 13:28.350
[JAKE] ALRIGHT, I'LL FIND THE
FOOD, NO PROBLEM.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.020
[NIKKI] HEY, UM, IF YOU COMMIT
TO DINNER SATURDAY NIGHT,

13:31.060 --> 13:35.940
I WILL DO THAT FOR YOU.
PLEASE. DAVID IS A REALLY
GOOD GUY, JAKE.

13:35.980 --> 13:40.400
[JAKE] LOOK, NIKKI, I CAN SEE
HOW DINNER WITH YOU AND YOUR NEW
FIANCE, SLASH DIVORCE LAWYER,

13:40.440 --> 13:45.450
WHO HAPPENED TO ROB ME BLIND IN
OUR SETTLEMENT WOULD BE FUN
FOR YOU, BUT ME, NOT SO MUCH.

13:46.950 --> 13:49.910
UH... FINE.

13:49.950 --> 13:55.330
[NIKKI] GREAT. SATURDAY,
8. AND DON'T USE THAT
THING IN THE HOSPITAL.

13:56.920 --> 14:00.710
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
[DES] HELLO?
JAKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:00.750 --> 14:03.960
ME? I'M SLAYING
MONSTERS, METAPHORICALLY
SPEAKING OF COURSE.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.340
[JAKE] WHATEVER. DES, FIND THE
FOOD THAT J.J. WAS EATING AND

14:06.380 --> 14:08.340
BRING IT TO THE HOSPITAL
FOR NIKKI, OKAY?

14:08.390 --> 14:11.060
[DES] OH, NO, WE THREW
IT OUT, MAN. J.J. HATES
WHEN THERE'S FOOD AROUND.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.060
IT'S IN THE GARBAGE.
[JAKE] I DON'T CARE! FIND IT.

14:13.100 --> 14:16.520
THE OTHER OPTION IS YOU CAN SORT
THROUGH THE REMNANTS OF J.J.'S
BOWEL MOVEMENTS.

14:16.560 --> 14:20.560
[DES] HEY, HOW WOULD YOU
LIKE TO GET INTO THE BOWELS
OF PRIVATE INVESTIGATING?

14:22.480 --> 14:24.190
[J.J.] GOOD MORNING.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.700
[LEAH] J.J., WHAT HAPPENED?
DID SOMEONE REALLY TRY
TO POISON YOU?

14:26.740 --> 14:30.870
[J.J.] NO. BUT I LEARNED
SOMETHING, IF YOU WANT
TO EAT ENDANGERED SPECIES,

14:30.910 --> 14:32.280
MAKE SURE THEY'RE DECLAWED.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.200
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

14:34.240 --> 14:36.870
[LEAH] IT'S ALL A BIG JOKE,
ISN'T IT, J.J.?
YOU WERE POISONED BY A STALKER.

14:36.910 --> 14:40.080
YOU'VE BEEN THREATENED BEFORE?

14:40.130 --> 14:43.670
[J.J.] LEAH JORDAN, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, THINKS THAT WRITING
A BLOG MEANS SHE'S A JOURNALIST.

14:43.710 --> 14:46.220
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;
[LEAH] "SHUT UP AND DANCE."

14:46.260 --> 14:50.510
"LAST CHANCE TO LEAVE."
"END OF THE LAUGH LINE."

14:50.550 --> 14:53.470
I FOUND THESE IN YOUR GARBAGE,
YOU'VE BEEN RECEIVING
DEATH THREATS.

14:53.510 --> 14:55.720
[STAN] OKAY, UH,
HE'S GOTTA GET HIS REST.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.690
[J.J.] SEE YA, FOLKS!
LOCK IT DOWN!

14:57.730 --> 14:59.690
[STAN] GIVE ME THOSE! I'M NOT
PLAYING WITH YA, LEAH.

14:59.730 --> 15:02.020
NEXT TIME,
I'LL HAVE YOU ARRESTED.

15:03.150 --> 15:05.900
&lt;♪&gt;

15:08.950 --> 15:11.120
[JAKE] J.J.'S HIDING
SOMETHING FROM US.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.160
[MAL] QUESTION IS, WHY?

15:16.200 --> 15:18.040
[CHANTEL] TINNY? IT'S DYLAN.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.370
HE'S HERE TO SEE YOU.

15:19.420 --> 15:20.750
[TINNY] YOU INVITED HIM.

15:20.790 --> 15:22.130
[DYLAN] WHAT'S GOING ON, LADIES?

15:22.170 --> 15:29.010
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY. WHAT'S
GOING ON HERE? EXPERT WORK.

15:29.050 --> 15:30.970
I'M WEARING A CUP THIS TIME.

15:31.010 --> 15:34.140
[TINNY] REALLY? YOU CAN'T TELL.

15:34.180 --> 15:38.020
[DYLAN] YOU GOT ANY BEERS?
YOU KNOW, MAKE A LITTLE
TOAST TO NEW BUSINESS?

15:38.060 --> 15:41.940
[CHANTEL] THERE'S, EH UH, PEACH
COOLER IN THE FRIDGE.

15:41.980 --> 15:44.520
[DYLAN] OH, UH, CALL SOME
PEOPLE, HAVE A LITTLE PARTY.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.150
[CHANTEL] SOUNDS GREAT.

15:46.190 --> 15:48.150
[DYLAN] YOU COOL WITH THAT,
TIN-TIN?

15:48.190 --> 15:53.240
[TINNY] JUST POST THE GROW-OP ON
FACEBOOK, AND THEN EVERY SKEET
IN TOWN CAN COME RIP US OFF.

15:53.280 --> 15:57.160
[DYLAN] YOU'RE FUNNY.
I LIKE FUNNY GIRLS.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.960
[TINNY] AND I LIKE SMART GUYS.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
AND CALL ME TIN-TIN AGAIN,
AND YOU'LL NEED MORE THAN
A CUP TO PROTECT YOU.

16:05.210 --> 16:08.710
[TYLER] P.I., SOUNDS COOL, I
MEAN WHEN YOU'RE NOT DIGGING
THROUGH GARBAGE.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.180
[DES] YEAH, IT'S LIKE,
I GOT THIS BRAIN, RIGHT,

16:12.220 --> 16:17.180
THAT'S JUST LIKE NATURALLY
INCLINED TOWARDS LIKE,
LOGIC AND INVESTIGATION.

16:17.220 --> 16:19.270
IT'D BE A SIN TO WASTE, MAN.
[TYLER] UH-HUH.

16:19.310 --> 16:23.940
[DES] LOOK AT THIS!
WHEN WILL PEOPLE LEARN?
OUR PLANET, OUR HOME!

16:24.810 --> 16:25.690
SORRY.

16:25.730 --> 16:27.520
[TYLER] IT'S OKAY.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.490
[DES] SO, UH,
YOU WANT TO BE A COMEDIAN?

16:29.530 --> 16:31.700
[TYLER] YEAH.
AND A SCREENWRITER.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.360
I'VE GOT THIS
"SQUID DUDE" SCRIPT.

16:33.410 --> 16:36.910
J.J.'S GONNA READ IT
WHEN HE GETS A SEC.
IT'S ALL ABOUT TIMING, RIGHT?

16:36.950 --> 16:40.160
[DES] TIMING, YEAH, MAN.
FOR SURE. YOU KNOW, AND SKILL.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.580
AND TALENT HELPS. AND LUCK,
BUT IT'S MOSTLY TALENT.

16:46.170 --> 16:48.630
[TYLER] YO, YO! CHECK IT OUT.

16:48.670 --> 16:52.930
[DES] AH, NICE WORK MAN! MAN.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.340
[TYLER] OKAY, YOU CAN HAVE IT.

16:54.380 --> 16:57.470
[DES] SORRY, SORRY, MAN. I JUST
GOT A LITTLE EXCITED--

16:57.510 --> 17:00.430
SOMETHING'S ALIVE!
SOMETHING JUST TOUCHED ME!
SOMETHING JUST TOUCHED ME!

17:00.470 --> 17:02.770
[ROSE] OKAY. "LEAH'S LOWDOWN."

17:02.810 --> 17:05.150
SHE'S A BIG FAN OF HIS OLD
MATERIAL, AND IT LOOKS LIKE HER

17:05.190 --> 17:07.520
BLOG HAS PUT HIM BACK ON THE
NETWORK RADAR.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.860
[JAKE] SO SHE LOVED HIM ONCE.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.480
[MAL] AND NOW SHE SUDDENLY HATES
HIS GUTS.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.320
[JAKE] SOUNDS LIKE EVERY
RELATIONSHIP I'VE EVER HAD. HOW

17:12.360 --> 17:15.780
MUCH YOU WANNA BET THAT SAYS
J.J. WAS SLEEPING WITH HER? IT'S

17:15.820 --> 17:17.070
ALWAYS ABOUT THE SEX.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.410
[ROSE] OH, HELL HATH NO FURY.

17:18.450 --> 17:20.200
[JAKE] LIKE A PERSON DUMPED.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.370
EXACTLY. WHAT ABOUT RHONDA?

17:22.410 --> 17:23.790
[ROSE] I SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW.

17:23.830 --> 17:25.620
THERE'S NO RHONDA STRIDE
ANYWHERE ON THIS ISLAND. MAYBE

17:25.670 --> 17:27.420
SHE CHANGED HER NAME?

17:27.460 --> 17:29.630
[JAKE] WOULD YOU MIND
LOOKING INTO THAT FOR US?
[ROSE] YEAH.

17:29.670 --> 17:33.170
[JAKE] I'M GONNA GO TO
THE HOTEL, SEE WHO'S COMING
AND GOING.

17:33.220 --> 17:38.260
[MAL] YOU, UH, YOU WANNA GO TO
THE HALL OF RECORDS, DIG AROUND
SOME OLD FILES?

17:38.300 --> 17:41.560
[ROSE] YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO
TALK TO A GIRL. GET HER ALL HOT
AND BOTHERED.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.730
[MAL] THEY HAVE PERIODICALS.

17:43.770 --> 17:48.060
[ROSE] AH, LET'S GO! HEY WHAT
ARE YOU UP TO?

17:48.110 --> 17:50.650
[DES] UH, I'M READING THE
SCRIPT, "THE SQUID DUDE AND
THE BOY FROM BAY BULLS."

17:50.690 --> 17:54.150
IT'S TYLER'S SCRIPT.
I'M ALREADY ON ACT 9, AND
IT'S PRETTY WICKED.

17:54.190 --> 17:58.870
ALTHOUGH THE PARALLELS
WITHIN THE NARRATIVE
ARE SOMEWHAT OPAQUE.

17:58.910 --> 18:01.290
COULD DO WITH A BIT MORE
NUDITY THOUGH.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.700
[ROSE] LET'S GO.

18:07.330 --> 18:09.920
[JAKE] PURSUING? I'M NOT
PURSUING ANYONE. I ASKED HER
OUT. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

18:09.960 --> 18:11.960
[WALTER] I WORK WITH HER, JAKE.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.670
LOOK, ALL I ASK, IS THAT YOU
DON'T MAKE THIS MY PROBLEM,
SERIOUSLY.

18:14.720 --> 18:18.090
[JAKE] WELL WHY DID YOU,
YOU KNOW, INTRODUCE ME
TO HER IN THE FIRST PLACE?

18:18.140 --> 18:22.890
[WALTER] JAKE, YOU DON'T
NEED TO SLEEP WITH EVERY
WOMAN I INTRODUCE YOU TO.

18:22.930 --> 18:26.190
ALTHOUGH SHE IS
EXTRAORDINARILY HOT.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.940
[JAKE] HOLD ON FOR A SECOND.
I'VE GOT ANOTHER CALL. YEAH?

18:28.980 --> 18:31.570
[ALLISON] HOW'S THE PITCH
COMING?

18:31.610 --> 18:36.240
[JAKE] ALLISON! HEY-HI-HELLO
THERE. HOW, HOW ARE YOU?

18:36.280 --> 18:38.320
[ALLISON] SO?

18:38.360 --> 18:40.450
[JAKE] YES.

18:40.490 --> 18:46.370
[ALLISON] YES? I THINK WHAT YOU
MEAN IS SATURDAY NIGHT,
8 O'CLOCK, DINNER. PICK ME UP.

18:46.410 --> 18:50.500
[JAKE] DO-DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU
PICK ME UP, OR I PICK YOU UP?

18:50.540 --> 18:53.170
[ALLISON] YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

18:53.210 --> 18:59.220
[JAKE] OH, WHA-WAIT-- AH,
I CAN'T DO--

18:59.260 --> 19:01.890
WALTER, BUDDY,
I GOTTA GO. I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

19:02.760 --> 19:03.970
[ALLISON] WALTER.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.190
&lt;CAMERA PHONE CLICKING&gt;

19:12.900 --> 19:15.860
[NIKKI] SO, I'VE SETTLED ON
PRIME RIB FOR SATURDAY

19:15.900 --> 19:20.240
[JAKE] YEAH, UH, LISTEN. ABOUT
THAT, SOMETHING KINDA CAME UP.

19:20.280 --> 19:25.290
[NIKKI] NO DINNER,
NO TOX REPORT. GOT ME?

19:25.330 --> 19:27.120
[JAKE] I LOVE PRIME RIB.

19:27.160 --> 19:31.460
[NIKKI] PERFECT. SO, DES DROPPED
BY WITH A NASTY BIT OF TUNA.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.170
IT WAS FILLED WITH
GLYCOPYRRONIUM.

19:33.210 --> 19:35.380
[JAKE] GLYCOPER-WHAT?

19:35.420 --> 19:38.340
[NIKKI] MEDICATION USED IN
TERMINAL CARE. IT MAKES IT HARD
TO BREATHE FOR A HEALTHY PERSON.

19:38.380 --> 19:42.090
[JAKE] REALLY? UH, THANK YOU. I
APPRECIATE IT. CAN I KEEP THIS?

19:42.140 --> 19:45.310
[NIKKI] MHMM. SATURDAY. NO
EXCUSES. I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.

19:45.350 --> 19:48.350
[JAKE] I'VE GOT YOUR NEW FIANCE
TO THANK FOR THAT.

19:51.310 --> 19:58.570
[ROSE] OKAY. RHONADA GIRL,
WHERE ARE YOU? OH! AH, HI.

19:58.610 --> 20:01.990
&lt;GIGGLING&gt;

20:02.030 --> 20:04.160
[ROSE] WHERE IS THIS COMING
FROM ALL OF A SUDDEN?

20:04.200 --> 20:06.990
[MAL] I DON'T KNOW,
BUT EVERYTHING JUST SEEMS RIGHT
IN THE WORLD.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.410
I'M FEELING GREAT.
YOU'RE LOOKING GREAT.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.540
EVEN THE GRANDDAUGHTER
WE HAVE AT HOME IS ACTING GREAT,
DON'T YA THINK?

20:13.580 --> 20:16.300
[ROSE] TINNY'S REALLY GROWING
INTO HERSELF, ISN'T SHE?

20:16.340 --> 20:18.130
[MAL] I'LL HAVE YOU
ALL TO ME SELF.

20:18.170 --> 20:22.340
[ROSE] NOW, QUESTION IS, WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH ME?

20:22.380 --> 20:24.390
[MAL] HMMM.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.600
&lt;GIGGLING&gt;

20:28.640 --> 20:30.230
[MAL] LET'S GO.

20:32.940 --> 20:33.600
[TYLER] A PALLIATIVE CARE DRUG?

20:33.650 --> 20:35.480
WHO WOULD DO THAT
TO J.J.?

20:35.520 --> 20:37.980
[J.J.] MY SERIES IS ABOUT TO BE
ORDERED. JUST WHEN THINGS ARE

20:38.030 --> 20:40.940
GOING RIGHT FOR ME--
[JAKE] OKAY, J.J., SIT DOWN.

20:40.990 --> 20:45.820
I NEED YOU TO STAY CALM,
ALRIGHT. NOW, LEAH JORDAN.
YOU WANNA TELL ME ABOUT HER?

20:45.870 --> 20:50.450
ANY IDEA WHY SHE'D BE HANGING
OUT WITH YOUR OLD COMEDY
PARTNER, KENT?

20:50.500 --> 20:52.830
[STAN] JAKE! WHY AREN'T YOU
DRESSED? WE HAVE THE THING WITH
THE MAYOR IN AN HOUR.

20:52.870 --> 20:55.120
[TYLER] HE'S GETTING AN AWARD
FROM THE CITY.

20:55.170 --> 20:58.840
[JAKE] GOOD FOR HIM. J.J., LEAH
JORDAN. IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT
HER IN YOUR PAST I SHOULD KNOW?

20:58.880 --> 21:02.300
[J.J.] OKAY--
[STAN] J.J.
JUST KEEP THAT TO YOURSELF.

21:02.340 --> 21:06.390
[J.J.] I SLEPT WITH HER. A
COUPLE OF TIMES. THEN I DUMPED
HER. IT'S AN OLD STORY.

21:06.430 --> 21:10.020
[JAKE] YOU SEE, THIS IS
THE KIND OF INFORMATION
THAT'LL HELP ME DO MY JOB.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.980
ALL RIGHT, WHAT ABOUT KENT?
IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT HIM?
DID YOU SLEEP WITH HIM TOO?

21:13.020 --> 21:16.860
[J.J.] KENT WAS A HACK.
HE STILL IS HACK. HE'S
LUCKY TO EVEN KNOW ME.

21:16.900 --> 21:21.490
LOOK, I BANGED A LOTTA CHICKS.
DO YOU WANNA LIST OF THEM ALL?
I'LL GET RIGHT ONTO THAT.

21:21.530 --> 21:25.490
AS A MATTER OF FACT, ASK TYLER,
HE PROBABLY KEEPS TRACK. HIS
NOSE IS SO FAR UP MY ASS--

21:25.530 --> 21:27.070
[STAN] JUST GRAB YOUR CLOTHES
AND GET DRESSED IN THE LIMO.

21:27.120 --> 21:31.290
[J.J.] STAN! YOU'RE
WORSE THAN THE KID. HE'S
GOT TALENT. WHAT DO YOU GOT?

21:31.330 --> 21:32.580
[DES] LOCK IT DOWN!

21:32.620 --> 21:34.500
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;
[JAKE] DES, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

21:34.540 --> 21:37.290
[DES] UH, THIS WAS, UH,

21:43.720 --> 21:46.890

[JAKE] WOAH. JUST--
"REVENGE OF THE SQUID GAL"?

21:52.060 --> 21:54.230
[DES] OH MY GOD.
IS THAT HUMAN HAIR?

21:54.270 --> 21:57.060
&lt;GROANING&gt;
[DES] LOOKS LIKE IT--

21:57.100 --> 21:58.270
[JAKE] SHUT UP!

21:58.310 --> 21:59.810
[J.J.] OH, I HATE CLOWNS.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.440
[LESLIE] CAN'T YOU HIT ON A
PARKING METER COP OR SOMETHING?

22:01.480 --> 22:02.780
[JAKE] HA, HA, AH. HERE, LOOK.

22:02.820 --> 22:06.150
TAKE A LOOK A THIS.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.280
[LESLIE] IS THAT HAIR?

22:08.320 --> 22:11.450
[JAKE] YEAH, I THINK SO. MY, UH,
CLIENT, HE'S BEEN GETTING SOME
WEIRD THREATS LATELY.

22:11.490 --> 22:15.540
[LESLIE] JAKE, FINE, WHATEVER. I
REALLY DON'T CARE. GOODBYE.

22:15.580 --> 22:18.460
[JAKE] WELL-- OKAY-- LOOK, I
KNOW YOU'RE GOING OUT WITH MAYOR

22:18.500 --> 22:20.920
AND YOU'RE NOT WITH ME AND WE
GOTTA BE FRIENDS OR WHATEVER.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE MEAN ABOUT IT.

22:23.050 --> 22:26.340
[LESLIE] LOOK, I GOT ENOUGH
CHILDISH MEN IN MY LIFE,
SO WOULD YOU KNOCK IT OFF?

22:26.380 --> 22:27.800
I DON'T NEED IT FROM YOU.

22:27.840 --> 22:32.180
[JAKE] LESLIE, I WAS JOKING, BY,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YA?

22:32.220 --> 22:34.720
[LESLIE] SORRY.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.230
[JAKE] ARE YA ALL RIGHT?

22:37.270 --> 22:38.730
[MAL] WHAT WAS THAT?

22:38.770 --> 22:40.020
[JAKE] I DON'T KNOW.

22:40.060 --> 22:42.480
[MAL] RHONDA STRIDE IS NOW
RHONDA PECK. STILL TRACKING DOWN

22:42.520 --> 22:43.480
AN ADDRESS.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.070
[JAKE] RHONDA PECK.

22:45.110 --> 22:47.650
[MAYOR CLARKE] LET'S GET RIGHT
TO THE REAL ATTRACTION. LADIES

22:47.700 --> 22:50.030
AND GENTLEMEN, J.J. MURPHY!

22:50.070 --> 22:57.870
&lt;CROWD CHEERING&gt;
[J.J.] THANK YOU.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.750
[MAL] LOOK WHO SHOWED UP.

22:59.790 --> 23:00.960
[JAKE] OUR SUPER FAN.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.420
[J.J.] THANK YOU! WHAT? OH!

23:03.460 --> 23:06.590
[JAKE] WHAT'S HE DOING? COME ON.

23:06.630 --> 23:09.720
[J.J.] THANK YOU! I WAS KINDA
HOPING FOR THE KEYS TO THE CITY.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.760
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;
[J.J.] I WANTED
TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

23:11.800 --> 23:15.100
TO ENTER ALL YOUR
HOMES AND SEE YOU NAKED.

23:15.140 --> 23:17.600
JUST TO THANK YOU PERSONALLY,
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

23:17.640 --> 23:21.980
AND NOW I GET A PLAQUE INSTEAD.
NOW, SERIOUSLY, THIS IS
A WONDERFUL HONOUR.

23:22.020 --> 23:23.110
THIS--
SORRY, DOES THIS HAVE A NAME?

23:23.150 --> 23:28.150
&lt;BELLS CHIMING&gt;
&lt;CROWD SCREAMING&gt;

23:31.530 --> 23:34.530
&lt;♪&gt;

23:44.670 --> 23:46.420
&lt;MICROPHONE SCREECHING&gt;

23:47.590 --> 23:50.590
[J.J.] WELL NICE SAVE, IDIOT.
NOTHING HAPPENED.

23:55.680 --> 23:56.520
EXCEPT THAT.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.600
[JAKE] COULDA BEEN WORSE.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.270
COULDA HAD TO LISTEN TO
THE REST OF YOUR ACT.

24:02.650 --> 24:03.860
&lt;♪&gt;

24:03.900 --> 24:06.070
[LESLIE] THE ICE CREAM TRUCK WAS
REPORTED STOLEN AN HOUR AGO.

24:06.110 --> 24:07.150
WE'LL CHECK IT FOR PRINTS.

24:07.190 --> 24:08.440
[JAKE] THANK YOU.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.740
[LESLIE] UH, BILL-- MAYOR
CLARKE, THIS IS, UH,

24:10.780 --> 24:11.990
THIS IS JAKE DOYLE.

24:12.030 --> 24:13.660
[MAYOR CLARKE] I OWE YOU.
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

24:13.700 --> 24:18.330
[JAKE] YEAH WELL,
YOU CAN BLOW UP ATLANTIC PLACE,
WE'LL CALL IT EVEN.

24:18.370 --> 24:20.660
[HOOD] STEERING WHEEL WAS
TIED OFF.

24:20.710 --> 24:25.130
KNIFE WAS, UH, STUCK IN THE GAS
PEDAL. WE FOUND THIS.

24:25.170 --> 24:27.550
[JAKE] "EXIT STAGE LEFT."

24:27.590 --> 24:29.420
[LESLIE] DOES THAT MEAN
ANYTHING TO YA?

24:29.460 --> 24:31.470
[J.J.] NO, BUT IT'S GOOD ADVICE.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.470
[JAKE] THAT GUY'S HILARIOUS.

24:39.930 --> 24:43.560
TAKE IT EASY WITH ALL THE
CONDOS. DON'T SCREW UP THE CITY.

24:48.690 --> 24:51.610
[MAL] WE HAVE A REPORTER WHO
HATES HIM. A CLUB OWNER WHO
HATES HIM.

24:51.650 --> 24:54.570
[ROSE] A CRAZED, SUPER-FAN
WHO LOVES HIM. AN OLD TROOP
MEMBER WE CAN'T FIND.

24:54.610 --> 24:55.530
[JAKE] OF COURSE THERE'S J.J.

24:55.570 --> 24:57.660
WHO BOTH LOVES AND HATES
HIMSELF.

24:57.700 --> 25:00.750
[DES] THE MONKEY WAS THE KILLER!

25:00.790 --> 25:02.250
[JAKE] WHAT WAS THAT, DESDEMONA?

25:02.290 --> 25:05.210
[DES] SUPER FAN FICTION.
THEY'RE STORIES, OR WORKS,

25:05.250 --> 25:08.210
WRITTEN BY FANS THEMSELVES
BASED ON THEIR FAVOURITE
SHOW OR CHARACTER,

25:08.250 --> 25:13.880
BUT THE BEAUTY WITH FAN
FICTION IS THAT SOMETIMES
THEY ENGAGE IN SELF INSERTION,

25:13.930 --> 25:17.350
WHERE THE WRITER ACTUALLY
PUTS HIMSELF, OR HERSELF,
INTO THE SCRIPT.

25:17.390 --> 25:20.220
[JAKE] SO DID, UH, TYLER SELF
INSERT HIMSELF?

25:20.270 --> 25:23.100
[DES] NO, HE DIDN'T,
BUT 49 CHARACTERS AND
NO TYLER CHARACTER,

25:23.140 --> 25:25.520
SO I GUESS HE'S NOT A SUPER FAN.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.650
[JAKE] NO, BUT RYAN IS.

25:29.690 --> 25:34.320
[ROSE] YEAH, IF HE LOVES
HIM SO MUCH, WHY'D HE
SCRATCH ALL HIS EYES OUT?

25:34.360 --> 25:36.820
[JAKE] DO WE HAVE AN ADDRESS
FOR RYAN BRENTON?

25:36.870 --> 25:38.870
[DES] I CAN GET IT.

25:46.790 --> 25:48.340
[LESLIE] HI THERE.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.000
[MAYOR CLARKE] WELL,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

25:50.050 --> 25:52.760
THAT IS NOT
THE STRANGEST CEREMONY
I HAVE EVER PRESIDED OVER.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.010
[LESLIE] THANK GOD YOU'RE OKAY.

25:57.050 --> 26:00.720
[MAYOR CLARKE] WELL, THANK GOD
THAT DOYLE GUY WAS THERE.

26:00.760 --> 26:06.310
[LESLIE] IT'S NICE TO GET A
QUIET SECOND WITH YA ANYWAY.

26:06.350 --> 26:11.650
YOU KNOW, UM, I'M NOT
SURE HOW MUCH MORE OF
THIS SECRECY THING I CAN

26:11.690 --> 26:15.320
DEAL WITH. IT'S STARTING TO GET
ON MY NERVES, TO BE HONEST.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.740
[MAYOR CLARKE] YEAH? YOU KNOW
IT'S CUZ I'M ASHAMED OF YOU,

26:17.780 --> 26:20.870
RIGHT? TRULY, I'M JUST SAYING,
YOU'RE HORRIBLE TO LOOK AT.

26:20.910 --> 26:25.540
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;
[LESLIE] I'M SERIOUS. SORT OF.

26:27.710 --> 26:29.790
[MAYOR CLARKE] LET'S JUST
TAKE OUR TIME, OKAY?

26:29.830 --> 26:31.800
I MEAN, WE'LL SEE HOW YOU
FEEL IN A LITTLE WHILE.

26:31.840 --> 26:37.130
YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT SOONER OR
LATER THAT I'M A TOTAL DINK,
WAY TOO OLD FOR YOU,

26:37.180 --> 26:40.720
AND ALL THE REST. SO, BEFORE WE
ANNOUNCE YOU ON THE BALLOT,

26:40.760 --> 26:43.770
MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT TO SEE
IF YOU DUMP ME FIRST.

26:47.350 --> 26:50.360
[JAKE] HELLO? CRAZY, SUPER-FAN?

26:53.480 --> 26:54.650
ANYONE HOME?

26:54.690 --> 26:56.070
&lt;DOOR SLAMMING&gt;

26:59.240 --> 27:03.240
[JAKE] IS THIS LITERALLY
A LIST OF J.J.'S WORST FEARS?

27:09.830 --> 27:14.050
[MAL] OKAY,
I'M EVEN GETTING FREAKED OUT.
THIS IS PRETTY WEIRD.

27:14.090 --> 27:17.720
[JAKE] UH, YEAH. LOOK AT THIS.

27:17.760 --> 27:22.800
EVERY ONE OF THESE DRAWERS IS
LABELED. THIS IS CREEPY MAN.

27:22.850 --> 27:26.980
LOOK AT THIS. WOAH! JACKPOT.

27:27.020 --> 27:29.230
"SQUID DUDE" MEMORABILIA.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.440
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;
[JAKE] YEAH, I KNOW.

27:33.480 --> 27:37.150
I HAD THE BLUE ONE.
AH, SHHH. YOU HEAR THAT?

27:42.280 --> 27:44.330
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
GO GET HIM! GO ON!

27:45.410 --> 27:48.410
&lt;♪&gt;

28:07.350 --> 28:12.560
[KENT] LOOK GUYS, I'M NOT
THE STALKER. LEAH THE BLOGGER
WAS PAYING ME FOR DIRT.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.560
I WAS LOOKING FOR THE TAPE.

28:13.610 --> 28:15.480
[JAKE] SO WHAT WERE YOU DOING
AT RYAN'S?

28:15.520 --> 28:17.860
[KENT] WEIRD KID. COLLECTS
EVERYTHING J.J.

28:17.900 --> 28:22.490
I SOLD IT TO HIM A WHILE BACK,
ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER
"CATFUD" STUFF.

28:22.530 --> 28:24.870
NO ONE ELSE ON THE
PLANET HAS THIS TAPE.

28:24.910 --> 28:26.910
[MAL] WHY ARE THE BUTTONS ON
THIS THING SO SMALL?

28:26.950 --> 28:30.370
[JAKE] JUST GIVE IT TO ME,
WILL YA? I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
YOU STILL HAVE A VCR.

28:30.410 --> 28:33.290
[J.J.] BUT THESE PRISONERS ARE
JUST ENJOYING THE SUNNY DAY.

28:33.330 --> 28:36.710
[RHONDA] THEN WE BETTA LOCK IT
DOWN!

28:36.750 --> 28:39.920
[MAL] IS THAT RHONDA AS SQUID
GAL?

28:39.960 --> 28:43.050
[KENT] YEAH. RHONDA WAS THE REAL
BRAINS OF THE TROOP. SHE AND

28:43.090 --> 28:45.090
J.J., THEY WERE A BIG COUPLE.

28:45.140 --> 28:48.680
THEN HE DUMPED HER, AND--
[JAKE] STOLE HER MATERIAL.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.140
[KENT] EVERY WORD.

28:50.180 --> 28:52.140
[MAL] I WONDER HOW THE NETWORK
WOULD REACT IF THEY FOUND OUT

28:52.190 --> 28:55.560
THEIR NEW SHOW AS BASED ON
STOLEN MATERIAL.

28:55.610 --> 28:57.480
[JAKE] WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS
BIT?

28:57.520 --> 29:00.070
[KENT] UM, THAT'S
"REVENGE...REVENGE OF THE SQUID

29:00.110 --> 29:03.860
GAL." YEAH.

29:03.910 --> 29:08.160
[JAKE] SO, I'M GUESSING THAT,
UH, ALL THESE; THEY'RE THE NAMES

29:08.200 --> 29:09.950
OF OTHER SKETCHES?

29:09.990 --> 29:11.910
[KENT] THERE'S ONLY THREE PEOPLE
IN WORLD WHO WOULD KNOW THAT.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.460
ME, J.J. AND RHONDA.

29:13.500 --> 29:16.380
[JAKE] AND RYAN, OUR SUPER FAN,
HE'D MAKE 4. CAN YOU REMEMBER

29:16.420 --> 29:17.790
THE NAMES OF ANY OTHER ONES?

29:17.840 --> 29:20.000
[KENT] WELL WE ALWAYS CLOSED
WITH "TAKE THE PLUNGE."

29:20.050 --> 29:22.380
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
[JAKE] SORRY. EXCUSE ME. YEAH.

29:22.420 --> 29:25.800
[J.J.] YEAH, IT'S ME.
WANNA DRINK?

29:25.840 --> 29:29.720
[JAKE] SURE. JUST, UH,
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. IT'S J.J.

29:29.760 --> 29:33.350
I'M GUESSING IT'S EITHER
RYAN OR RHONDA. IT HAS
TO BE ONE OF THEM.

29:33.390 --> 29:35.400
WHERE ARE YOU?
I'M COMING TO YOU NOW.

29:37.060 --> 29:40.070
&lt;♪&gt;

29:47.820 --> 29:49.410
[JAKE] HEY THERE.

29:50.240 --> 29:56.620
[J.J.] YOU KNOW MARLON BRANDO,
HE HAD A STALKER.

29:56.670 --> 30:00.960
SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD A PLAN
TO KILL BRANDO AND TO EAT HIM.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.920
[JAKE] I ACTUALLY ALREADY KNEW
THAT.

30:02.960 --> 30:07.680
[J.J.] BUT SHE LOVED BRANDO
SO MUCH, SHE CONFESSED
EVERYTHING TO HIM.

30:07.720 --> 30:10.970
[JAKE] OH YEAH? WHAT DID BRANDO
DO?

30:11.010 --> 30:14.560
[J.J.] HE BANGED HER.

30:14.600 --> 30:18.020
[JAKE] WELL, I WOULDN'T
NECESSARILY RECOMMEND THAT
COURSE OF ACTION FOR YOU,

30:18.060 --> 30:21.020
IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION.

30:21.070 --> 30:25.030
[J.J.] WE HAD A GIG UP HERE
ONCE. OUR LAST GIG. "CATFUD."

30:25.070 --> 30:29.030
"TAKE THE PLUNGE," AT
THE END OF THE SHOW WE
PRETENDED TO JUMP OFF.

30:29.070 --> 30:30.830
STUPID GAG, NEVER WORKED.

30:32.660 --> 30:34.660
YOU WANNA KNOW A SECRET?

30:36.460 --> 30:45.050
I'M NOT FUNNY. I NEVER WAS.

30:45.090 --> 30:46.510
I'M A FRAUD.

30:46.550 --> 30:49.760
[JAKE] I KNOW. RHONDA STRIDE.

30:49.800 --> 30:52.140
YOU STOLE HER MATERIAL, AND THEN
YOU GOT RICH. THAT KINDA THING,

30:52.180 --> 30:54.270
IT TENDS TO LEAVE A MARK.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.730
&lt;LAUGHING&gt;

30:56.770 --> 31:01.230
[J.J.] I RIPPED OFF HER
ENTIRE ACT, 20 YEARS AGO.

31:01.270 --> 31:05.530
SHE MADE ME FAMOUS. YOU GONNA
TURN ME IN? EXPOSE ME?

31:05.570 --> 31:10.370
[JAKE] YOU HIRED ME TO FIND YOUR
STALKER, NOT FIND OUT WHERE YOU
GET YOUR CRAPPY MATERIAL.

31:10.410 --> 31:14.330
[J.J.] RHONDA'S THE ONE WHO'S
BEEN MAKING THE THREATS.

31:14.370 --> 31:17.460
[JAKE] LOOKS LIKE IT.

31:17.500 --> 31:23.250
[J.J.] SHE WROTE ME, CALLED.
I NEVER OPENED ONE LETTER.
I SENT THEM ALL BACK.

31:23.290 --> 31:29.300
I WAS AFRAID SHE'D GO
PUBLIC WITH THIS TAPE,
EXPOSE ME FOR WHAT I AM.

31:29.340 --> 31:32.550
[JAKE] WE SHOULD GO TO
THE COPS NOW, BEFORE THIS GOES
ANY FURTHER.

31:32.600 --> 31:37.600
[J.J.] YOU FIND HER.
I WANNA FACE HER ABOUT THIS.
I OWE HER THAT.

31:39.140 --> 31:41.900
FINALLY, FINALLY.

31:43.900 --> 31:50.110
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
[J.J.] WHAT? WHAT DO YA MEAN?

31:50.150 --> 31:55.950
YEAH? YOU SERIOUS? UH, OKAY.

31:55.990 --> 32:02.080
I'LL-- OKAY. FINE.
THEY JUST ORDERED THE SHOW.

32:02.130 --> 32:06.800
I'VE BEEN PICKED UP.
IT'S GREEN LIT.

32:06.840 --> 32:08.970
[JAKE] CONGRATULATIONS.

32:09.010 --> 32:13.640
[J.J.] YOU JUST BRING ME RHONDA,
OKAY? I NEED TO FACE HER.
MAKE THIS RIGHT.

32:21.100 --> 32:25.190
[DYLAN] TIN-TIN. SORRY, TINNY.

32:25.230 --> 32:29.030
WHERE YA GOING? YOU NEED A RIDE?

32:29.070 --> 32:30.860
[TINNY] I CAN WALK. THANKS.

32:30.900 --> 32:32.990
[DYLAN] YOU KNOW, FEAR IS A REAL
HINDRANCE IN LIFE.

32:33.030 --> 32:35.320
[TINNY] DEEP STUFF. GOOD ON YA!

32:35.370 --> 32:40.370
[DYLAN] OKAY. PLEASE LET ME TAKE
YOU HOME.

32:40.410 --> 32:42.670
[TINNY] DID YOU DRINK?

32:42.710 --> 32:46.040
[DYLAN] NOT A DROP.

32:46.090 --> 32:47.050
[TINNY] ALRIGHT.

32:59.430 --> 33:02.440
RIGHT-HAND DRIVE. WEIRD.

33:07.190 --> 33:09.190
&lt;CAR DOORS CLOSING&gt;

33:09.230 --> 33:12.320
[MAL] ROSE HAD A HELL OF A TIME
FINDING RHONDA'S ADDRESS.

33:12.360 --> 33:15.780
[JAKE] BUT J.J., I DUNNO, IT
MIGHT BE JUST ME, BUT I ALMOST

33:15.820 --> 33:17.950
FEEL LIKE THERE'S A CHANGE IN
HIM.

33:17.990 --> 33:19.740
[MAL] HE GROWIN' ON YA?

33:19.790 --> 33:25.210
[JAKE] WELL NO, I WOULDN'T SAY
THAT EXACTLY, MAYBE IT'S JUST
THE, YOU KNOW-- OW!

33:25.250 --> 33:30.380
THE IDEA THAT RHONDA COULD BE
HIS STALKER. HIM KNOWING
THAT IS GIVING HIM EASE.

33:30.420 --> 33:37.100
[MAL] RHONDA? WE'RE NOT HERE TO
CAUSE ANY TROUBLE. J.J. MURPHY
WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU.

33:37.140 --> 33:40.140
[JAKE] WE GOT BILLS, BILLS,

33:42.270 --> 33:45.020
COUPLE OF INSURANCE CHEQUES.
HERE.

33:55.860 --> 33:59.120
MAIL MAN! HELLO?

33:59.160 --> 34:00.530
[MAL] RHONDA?

34:00.580 --> 34:03.290
[JAKE] DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
ANYONE'S BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE.

34:03.330 --> 34:05.620
CISPLATIN, ALTRETAMINE,
WHAT THE HELL'S THIS?

34:05.670 --> 34:07.250
[MAL] CANCER DRUGS.

34:07.290 --> 34:12.260
I SAW ENOUGH OF THOSE BEFORE.
WITH YOUR MOTHER.
BEFORE SHE DIED.

34:12.300 --> 34:15.170
LOOKIE HERE, RYAN'S NOT THE ONLY
ONE WITH A J.J. OBSESSION.

34:15.220 --> 34:18.390
[JAKE] WELL, AT LEAST RYAN'S
VERY NEAT ABOUT HIS.

34:18.430 --> 34:22.720
[MAL] WOW, THESE ARE ALL
ADDRESSED TO J.J. IN NEW YORK.

34:22.770 --> 34:26.230
[JAKE] "RETURN TO SENDER,"
"RETURN TO SENDER." "RETURN TO
SENDER" ON ALL OF THEM.

34:26.270 --> 34:28.230
[MAL] J.J.'S HAIRBRUSH
THAT WAS STOLEN.

34:28.270 --> 34:33.230
[JAKE] REALLY? THIS ONE'S
ADDRESS TO AN ALPHONSO PECK.

34:33.280 --> 34:37.910
IT'S A PATERNITY TEST...
BETWEEN J.J. MURPHY AND RHONDA.

34:44.330 --> 34:49.080
DAD? I THINK THIS KID,
ALPHONSO, IS J.J.'S SON.

34:51.170 --> 34:52.130
[MAL] JAKE?

35:03.310 --> 35:06.480
[JAKE] WELL, THERE'S RHONDA.

35:06.520 --> 35:08.520
[MAL] THAT'S ONE MYSTERY SOLVED.

35:10.150 --> 35:11.270
[LESLIE] YOU'RE IN
BIG TROUBLE HERE.

35:11.310 --> 35:12.810
[JAKE] WHAT DO YOU
THINK HAPPENED?

35:12.860 --> 35:14.690
I KILLED HER, I FROZE HER,
I FOUND HER, THEN I CALLED YOU?

35:14.730 --> 35:17.530
LOOK, I'M AWARE I COME UP WITH
A LOT OF EXCUSES TO SEE YOU.

35:17.570 --> 35:19.700
[LESLIE] YOU JUST STUMBLED UPON
RHONDA STRIDE'S BODY?

35:19.740 --> 35:23.370
[MAL] THERE'S NO EXTERNAL
WOUNDS. I THINK SHE HAD
TERMINAL CANCER.

35:23.410 --> 35:24.740
[LESLIE] YOU EXAMINED HER?

35:24.790 --> 35:27.960
[JAKE] WELL, UH, YOU KNOW, JUST
A QUICK SCAN, NOTHING EXTENSIVE.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.040
YOU KNOW, MOVED A FEW TV
DINNERS AROUND.

35:30.080 --> 35:32.290
[MAL] FOUND SOME CHEQUES IN THE
MAILBOX. I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.

35:32.340 --> 35:35.340
BENEFICIARY HIDES THE
BODY TO KEEP COLLECTING
THE PENSION CHEQUES.

35:35.380 --> 35:38.300

FREEZER.

[JAKE] YUP.

35:43.550 --> 35:47.230

37:00.840 --> 37:05.010
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, ASK MY
DAD. HE'S A SUPREME COURT JUDGE.

37:05.050 --> 37:08.350
[MAL] IF YOU LOVE J.J. SO MUCH,
HOW COME YOU SCRATCHED
THE EYES OUT IN THOSE ALBUMS?

37:08.390 --> 37:10.810
[RYAN] I DIDN'T! THEY WERE
LIKE THAT WHEN I BOUGHT THEM
FROM KENT.

37:10.850 --> 37:13.890
I PAID 30 BUCKS FOR THEM,
BUT THEY'RE PRICELESS.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.860
[JAKE] STAN, HOW OLD IS TYLER?

37:15.900 --> 37:18.820
[STAN] ABOUT 26. DES,

37:18.860 --> 37:21.110

37:24.070 --> 37:25.910
[MAL] WAS THERE A CHARACTER
NAMED ALPHONSO?

[DES] YEAH, HE, HE'S THE LEAD.
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

37:27.870 --> 37:29.870

38:00.270 --> 38:04.490
YOU TOOK OFF TO NEW YORK, AND
YOU STOLE SQUID GAL.

38:04.530 --> 38:07.450
[J.J.] TYLER? DID I TELL YOU
THIS?

38:07.490 --> 38:09.870
[TYLER] I HAD FUN BEING AROUND
YOU. WATCHING YOU WORK DUMPY

38:09.910 --> 38:18.920
CLUBS, WATCHING YOU SUFFER. A
HACK. YOU'RE A TERRIBLE PERSON.

38:18.960 --> 38:23.010
A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE PERSON.

38:32.520 --> 38:35.850
DEAD. DID YOU HEAR THAT, DAD?

38:35.890 --> 38:38.730
[J.J.] WHY DO YOU KEEP CALLING

38:38.770 --> 38:42.400
[TYLER] YOU KNOW, I TOOK THIS
JOB TO GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER,

38:42.440 --> 38:47.450
TO FIND OUT WHY. TO HURT YOU...

38:47.490 --> 38:49.030

[JAKE] WE FOUND
YOUR MOTHER, TYLER.
[MAL] THIS MORNING.

39:05.760 --> 39:09.090
[TYLER] I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
WRONG. SHE TOLD ME TO DO IT,

39:09.140 --> 39:11.550
TO KEEP GETTING THE INSURANCE
CHEQUES. SHE WANTED ME TO GO TO

39:11.600 --> 39:13.430

[J.J.] WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU

39:13.470 --> 39:15.470

39:32.740 --> 39:39.420

[J.J.] I HAVE A SON. HE WANTS TO
KILL ME, BUT, UH, EVEN SO, IT'S

39:56.060 --> 40:00.230
BETTER THAN THE RELATIONSHIP I
HAD WITH MY FATHER.

40:00.270 --> 40:04.230
[TYLER] WHY DID YOU DO IT? WHY
DID YOU RUIN HER LIFE?

40:04.270 --> 40:07.280
