00:29.655 --> 00:32.871
I could go out on tour, actually,
and play by myself as far as...

00:32.872 --> 00:34.956
you know, most people
know, but, uh...

00:34.957 --> 00:36.670
It works like an orchestra
on-stage.

00:36.671 --> 00:38.746
I happen to write the songs.

00:38.747 --> 00:39.947
[singing]
♪ I write the songs ♪

00:41.583 --> 00:44.627
And I kind of conduct the band,

00:44.628 --> 00:46.005
and we work as an orchestra.

00:46.006 --> 00:47.922
I don't go out and...

00:47.923 --> 00:50.346
do a Tom Jones thing
with a bunch of sidemen.

00:54.012 --> 00:56.430
[Hook]
A hired gun is an assassin.

00:56.431 --> 01:01.018
The best available musician
that gets hired to go on tour,

01:01.019 --> 01:03.317
to deliver that music
for that artist.

01:03.318 --> 01:05.313
Nobody will know who he is.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.740
But he gets the gig
because he is the elite player.

01:31.008 --> 01:33.676
It seems like there's about twenty
musicians we're talking about

01:33.677 --> 01:35.837
that have made every single
record that everybody owns.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.867
There's always somebody standing
by ready to take your place

01:52.868 --> 01:54.530
if things aren't going well.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.531
That's for sure.

02:11.173 --> 02:14.598
My job security was my
awesomeness.

02:27.105 --> 02:30.575
You had to be even more focused than
somebody who's permanently in a band.

02:30.576 --> 02:33.110
Because, what
you're doing today

02:33.111 --> 02:35.955
reflects on what you are going
to be doing tomorrow.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.928
You have to play great all the time
because you're entertaining the name.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.975
And if you're not
great tonight,

03:00.976 --> 03:02.770
you may lose your
gig tomorrow.

03:08.605 --> 03:13.025
We know the riffs that they played
on guitar, or piano, or saxophone,

03:13.026 --> 03:14.706
but we don't know their face
or their name.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.666
[Hook]
Being a hired gun,

03:19.667 --> 03:22.451
you're sitting
in the front row,

03:22.452 --> 03:28.124
to a very glamorous, high
profile, exciting lifestyle.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.253
But it has nothing
to do with you.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.980
My mother
was always into music.

03:47.981 --> 03:51.699
We used to cut school to go see Frank
Sinatra and stuff like that...

03:51.700 --> 03:54.066
My father
was a bit of a square.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.737
But, they bought me a set
of drums when I was, maybe,

03:57.738 --> 03:59.530
twelve, eleven years old...

03:59.531 --> 04:02.251
Because, my father says, "Because
they didn't make Prozac back then."

04:10.959 --> 04:12.427
When I was 19 years old

04:12.428 --> 04:15.963
I was playing with a guy
named Richie Supa.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.507
And Doug Stegmeyer
and Russell Javors

04:18.507 --> 04:20.726
are in the audience
watching me play.

04:23.680 --> 04:27.397
There was just something about
Lib that was very, very special.

04:27.398 --> 04:29.982
And I would go there
as a kid and I'd say,

04:29.983 --> 04:31.817
"I'm going to start a band
with this guy.

04:31.818 --> 04:33.859
That's the drummer
I want to play with."

04:33.860 --> 04:34.949
And it just evolved.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.906
[Liberty] Eventually we
started a band called Topper.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.622
Doug Stegmeyer got the gig
with Billy first.

04:44.623 --> 04:47.747
He went on the Streetlife
Serenader tour with Billy Joel

04:47.748 --> 04:51.501
when Billy told Doug that he
wanted to move from California

04:51.502 --> 04:52.666
back to New York,

04:52.667 --> 04:54.840
and he wanted a New York
style drummer.

04:54.841 --> 04:57.213
So, Doug said, "Well...

04:57.214 --> 04:59.385
We got the guy-
I know the guy!"

04:59.386 --> 05:01.053
[Russell]
First one Doug brought in

05:01.054 --> 05:03.554
cause he was looking for a
rhythm section was Liberty.

05:03.555 --> 05:07.556
So they really started doing Turnstiles
together with the three of them.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.855
[Liberty] We got in the studio. The
three of us started to record,

05:09.856 --> 05:12.272
me, Doug and Billy,
just bass, drums and piano.

05:12.273 --> 05:14.441
And when we listened back,
Billy would say, "Well...

05:14.442 --> 05:16.529
You know, I could use
some guitar on this."

05:16.530 --> 05:18.744
And we said,
"Well, we know guitar players."

05:18.745 --> 05:19.902
So, eventually,

05:19.903 --> 05:22.780
Topper became
Billy Joel's band.

05:22.781 --> 05:26.081
And that was the band that went on
and toured the Turnstiles album.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.118
The rest is history.

05:43.677 --> 05:47.056
As a hired gun you have
to be on point all the time.

05:47.057 --> 05:49.395
Are you gonna be prepared
and ready to go?

05:49.396 --> 05:52.190
The one most important thing
that'll make it good

05:52.191 --> 05:53.435
is your attitude.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.063
Be damn sure you know,

05:56.064 --> 05:57.064
what the artist needs.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.316
That's the key.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.151
And then provide it.

06:01.152 --> 06:04.743
Being able to sing is always a plus.
If you can sing good, and play,

06:04.744 --> 06:07.411
you're gonna get the gig before
the guy that just plays good!

06:07.412 --> 06:09.753
You gotta be able to memorize
stuff... fast.

06:09.754 --> 06:14.039
We get good at zeroing in on
exactly what we need to hit

06:14.040 --> 06:15.087
very quickly.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.263
There's no room
for a B-game here.

06:24.264 --> 06:26.010
You gotta always bring A,

06:26.011 --> 06:28.304
and just knock teeth out.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.682
That's what you gotta do.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.152
[Rudy] I didn't really start
playing metal or rock

06:41.153 --> 06:43.197
until I became part
of Quiet Riot.

06:43.198 --> 06:45.946
And I'm talking about the Quiet
Riot version with Randy Rhoads

06:45.947 --> 06:48.490
which I was a member
of in the 70s.

06:48.491 --> 06:52.953
That version of Quiet Riot
was more of a glam rock band.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.289
But the music scene
at that time

06:55.290 --> 06:58.089
was very much centric on...

06:58.710 --> 07:00.210
New Wave and Punk.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.009
And bands like Quiet Riot...

07:02.010 --> 07:04.465
We were considered dinosaurs.

07:04.466 --> 07:07.807
There was word around town that
the singer from Black Sabbath

07:07.808 --> 07:10.806
was looking for new musicians, you
know, to put a band together.

07:10.807 --> 07:13.479
So, I was trying to get
a hold of anybody.

07:13.480 --> 07:14.683
Meanwhile,

07:14.684 --> 07:17.105
Ozzy's management,
his people, you know,

07:17.106 --> 07:18.571
were trying to get
a hold of Randy

07:18.572 --> 07:20.564
to come and audition.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.067
He went out there, you know,
met with Ozzy,

07:23.068 --> 07:26.698
and as he was tuning up and just
doodling around the guitar,

07:26.699 --> 07:28.364
he got the gig-

07:28.365 --> 07:30.658
And early 1981,

07:30.659 --> 07:32.580
I get the phone call from Ozzy,

07:32.581 --> 07:34.416
"Randy keeps telling me
that you're the one"

07:34.417 --> 07:36.708
and I met with Ozzy that night,
and Sharon,

07:36.709 --> 07:38.502
and I guess I passed the test.

07:38.503 --> 07:39.547
"You want the gig?"

07:40.085 --> 07:41.085
I said...

07:41.878 --> 07:42.920
"Yeah!"

07:42.921 --> 07:44.969
So, I went from sleeping
on a floor,

07:44.970 --> 07:46.757
just a sheet,

07:46.758 --> 07:49.555
to all of a sudden... I'm, not
only am a member of Ozzy's band,

07:49.556 --> 07:51.600
but, I'm living with him
and Sharon,

07:51.601 --> 07:54.264
up in a mansion
in Beverly Hills.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.688
It's been an incredible ride
ever since, you know.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.657
[Zombie] Good people don't stay
undiscovered for very long.

08:08.658 --> 08:11.875
That's what I always tell people
that think the business is so vast.

08:11.876 --> 08:13.283
It's not.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.286
Because if you're good
you stand out quick.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.085
Everybody in the business
from...

08:19.207 --> 08:21.792
From Marilyn Manson
to Rob Zombie,

08:21.793 --> 08:25.504
to Ozzy Osbourne, to myself,
who are lead singers...

08:25.505 --> 08:27.798
All know who...

08:27.799 --> 08:30.177
where the carrel...
The A carrel is.

08:30.178 --> 08:32.099
So, you, of course,
go for those guys first.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.568
All right. I broke two strings!

08:39.570 --> 08:40.644
Whoo!

08:40.645 --> 08:41.692
Two strings!

08:51.239 --> 08:52.661
[Newsted]
I remember getting the paper,

08:52.662 --> 08:53.991
and opening it up.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.832
And I remember my tears
hitting the newspaper...

08:56.833 --> 08:58.876
And, like, snot hitting
the newspaper.

08:58.877 --> 09:01.421
Man, it's like,
"Fuck, what? Fuck!"

09:07.297 --> 09:09.298
Anybody, especially at that
time they were into metal.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.507
He was our hero.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.097
He was Jimi Hendrix
of the bass, man.

09:12.098 --> 09:14.346
I've told that to anybody,
straight up.

09:14.347 --> 09:16.185
I don't care who you
are, playing bass.

09:16.186 --> 09:18.309
You're not as good as Cliff,
sorry.

09:18.310 --> 09:20.436
And, I had only seen him
in concert, man.

09:20.437 --> 09:22.731
I'm standing right in front
of Cliff, like...

09:22.732 --> 09:26.195
And spent my last 14 bucks on
my Metallica shirt, you know.

09:26.196 --> 09:27.780
The talk started happening.

09:27.781 --> 09:29.401
They were talking
about auditions.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.245
"Okay, who's the bass player,
man? We gotta get somebody

09:31.246 --> 09:32.951
because we have to continue
this tour."

09:32.952 --> 09:35.365
They have a big, big hit on her
hands, need to Rock n Roll.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.992
They've gotta push through.
There's momentum,

09:36.993 --> 09:38.961
and you're never gonna get
that momentum again.

09:38.962 --> 09:42.831
They call out 45 to 50 people
from around the world.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.501
And I got an early flight, borrowed
money from all of my friends.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.095
Twenty from that person,
ten from that person,

09:47.096 --> 09:48.551
seven, nine from that guy.

09:48.552 --> 09:51.550
Whatever they could give
me. "Dude, you got... "What?"

09:51.551 --> 09:54.384
An audition with Metallica?
Are you..."

09:54.385 --> 09:57.513
Everybody's flipping
the fuck out!

09:57.514 --> 10:00.480
And so, I was ready and I got there
early and I was there the first one.

10:00.481 --> 10:03.397
I was there before the band
got there on audition day.

10:03.398 --> 10:05.270
I look over and I poke my
head in,

10:05.271 --> 10:07.147
"What have I got myself into?

10:07.148 --> 10:09.446
Like I'm actually going
to step in and play with..."

10:09.447 --> 10:12.116
It hit me, like,
"Metallica, dude!"

10:14.114 --> 10:17.574
Eleven days after that
we were touring japan.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.670
Metallica touring Japan for the first
time and I was the bass player.

10:20.671 --> 10:22.037
And at that time,

10:22.038 --> 10:23.413
I was a hired gun,

10:23.414 --> 10:24.415
for $500 a week.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.416
"Okay-u

10:26.417 --> 10:27.543
I mean, I would have done it
for a sandwich.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.296
I mean, it wouldn't have
mattered then.

10:29.297 --> 10:32.886
I would have paid you guys five
bucks to let me go. Shit, you know!

10:32.887 --> 10:34.758
So that was it.
Five hundred dollars a week

10:34.759 --> 10:36.430
until April the next year,

10:36.431 --> 10:37.722
when I joined Metallica...

10:37.723 --> 10:40.185
And I was a full member
for 14, 15 years.

10:40.186 --> 10:43.228
I was not gonna pass this up
or take this for granted

10:43.229 --> 10:45.853
that I was given this
opportunity by these guys.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.604
"Now you're in it, dude.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.444
You signed
to be in this thing.

10:49.445 --> 10:50.986
You can't take that lightly.

10:50.987 --> 10:52.905
This is big
responsibility now."

10:52.906 --> 10:54.573
Everybody's got their
role in this band

10:54.574 --> 10:56.665
and nobody wants
to be the weak link.

10:56.666 --> 10:59.950
That's why that band
is still around.

10:59.951 --> 11:02.791
Finding the right person for
your band is almost impossible

11:02.792 --> 11:05.882
because you're looking for,
to me, three things.

11:05.883 --> 11:08.125
You got to find
somebody who...

11:08.126 --> 11:09.503
is an excellent musician

11:09.504 --> 11:11.630
which, that's the easiest
thing to find.

11:11.631 --> 11:14.050
There's a million excellent
musicians.

11:14.051 --> 11:16.970
Then you gotta find somebody
who's really cool...

11:16.971 --> 11:18.307
who can stand on stage

11:18.308 --> 11:20.351
in front of you know 15...
a 100,000 people,

11:20.352 --> 11:21.847
and be amazing.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.101
Then, it whittles it down
to a smaller group,

11:24.102 --> 11:27.980
<i>and then you gotta find somebody
you can stand to be around 2417.</i>

11:27.981 --> 11:31.277
Because, you know, you live
with them, day in and day out.

11:31.278 --> 11:32.821
Then it shrinks
down to about...

11:32.822 --> 11:34.651
Here's the three people,

11:34.652 --> 11:36.575
in the music industry I can
actually stand to be around.

11:36.576 --> 11:38.447
So, know, that is the trick.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.120
You're gonna be traveling with
these guys for the next year.

11:41.121 --> 11:43.285
So, you're gonna really
have to like these guys,

11:43.286 --> 11:45.162
because there are certain
people, you just don't...

11:45.163 --> 11:47.459
It rubs you the wrong way...
You know.

11:47.460 --> 11:50.586
[Newsted] It all comes down to the
chemistry between people and bang!

11:50.587 --> 11:52.461
And how you get along
with each other.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.885
And what kind of person
you present yourself as

11:54.886 --> 11:56.298
in the group.

11:56.299 --> 11:59.269
I've been lucky enough
to not have to be on a tour

11:59.270 --> 12:01.970
with any douchy people.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.267
I've talked to so many
friends of mine

12:04.268 --> 12:06.937
who just were, you know,
living hell on a tour,

12:06.938 --> 12:09.939
because of who they had
to deal with on a daily basis.

12:09.940 --> 12:12.316
There's been times where,
you know, you've...

12:12.317 --> 12:15.281
had someone in the band who maybe
isn't the greatest musician,

12:15.282 --> 12:18.155
and they leave and you replace
them with somebody better,

12:18.156 --> 12:19.618
technically a better musician,

12:19.619 --> 12:20.909
but the chemistry is gone.

12:20.910 --> 12:22.746
There's just something
about it, you know,

12:22.747 --> 12:25.077
because sometimes its just
that wacky personalities,

12:25.078 --> 12:27.797
the glue that keeps the other three
people from killing each other.

12:27.798 --> 12:29.373
There's a...

12:29.374 --> 12:30.874
A bond with musicians

12:30.875 --> 12:33.001
when the chemistry is right,

12:33.002 --> 12:34.836
and it's an alchemic thing.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.885
It's like people playing
together,

12:36.886 --> 12:41.593
and when some take happens
that is just magic...

12:41.594 --> 12:43.428
It's undeniable. There it is.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.429
Right in front of you.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.816
[Russell] When we got
into the studio with Billy,

12:50.817 --> 12:53.355
we had this interesting
chemistry,

12:53.356 --> 12:55.446
that you know, just kinda
clicked.

12:55.447 --> 12:56.817
You know, it was kinda cool.

12:56.818 --> 12:58.782
We were a very easy band
to play with.

12:58.783 --> 13:02.658
Nobody ever went in there with
a "I'll show you" attitude.

13:02.659 --> 13:04.625
It was always about framing
the song,

13:04.626 --> 13:05.951
framing Billy...

13:05.952 --> 13:08.580
We were very open minded
as to how we would do it.

13:08.581 --> 13:11.173
So, George Martin that comes
to one of the gigs,

13:11.174 --> 13:12.749
and we're all excited,

13:12.750 --> 13:15.922
"George Martin's here, Oh my,
God! The Beatles producer!

13:15.923 --> 13:17.465
He's going to come and hear
us play,

13:17.466 --> 13:19.509
and he's going to love it,
it's gonna be great.

13:19.510 --> 13:23.224
I mean, this is fantastic, he's like
the greatest producer in the world!"

13:23.225 --> 13:25.640
He watches the show...
After the show he says,

13:25.641 --> 13:29.311
"I love you, Billy. I want to produce
you, but I want to use studio guys."

13:29.312 --> 13:33.482
Billy was so loyal to the band
that he turned down George Martin.

13:33.483 --> 13:36.945
I just went off on my own and said,
"Look, I'm going to use my own guys.

13:36.946 --> 13:39.285
I don't care, politically,
what the ramifications are,

13:39.286 --> 13:41.278
I gotta use my own band."

13:41.279 --> 13:43.657
And, we went in with Phil
to do The Stranger.

13:43.658 --> 13:45.996
He saw the guys and he went,
"Wow, they're great!"

13:45.997 --> 13:48.165
He loved them, and the band
went, "He likes us?"

13:48.166 --> 13:51.538
[Russell] Certainly, Lib
and Doug's contribution,

13:51.539 --> 13:54.166
is what stood out in those
records,

13:54.167 --> 13:57.465
because, frequently, Billy would
record in a stripped down way,

13:57.466 --> 14:00.634
and we'd even do a lot of the basic
tracks with just basic drums.

14:00.635 --> 14:02.725
Phil came in and he said
to Liberty,

14:02.726 --> 14:05.635
"Why don't you play this
backwards samba?"

14:05.636 --> 14:08.263
And Liberty is a real Rock
n Roll drummer, and he...

14:08.264 --> 14:11.313
It's against every grain
in his body to play these...

14:11.314 --> 14:13.477
samba type line of beats.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.822
And he turned it around.
It was like, boom...

14:15.823 --> 14:17.030
[imitating drums]

14:18.608 --> 14:20.781

And he gave it more of a flow.

And it just...

14:33.753 --> 14:35.170
It flowed along a lot better.

14:38.086 --> 14:41.302
[Russell] Lib was right at
the core of those songs.

14:41.303 --> 14:45.222
And his mindset was just really
perfect for those records,

14:45.223 --> 14:48.303
because he had that tough
Rock n Roll

14:48.304 --> 14:50.347
attitude about those songs.

14:50.348 --> 14:53.814
Yet, he knew when to put
it out there and when not to.

14:53.815 --> 14:57.781
So, these were really parts that really
brought the song out of the grooves.

15:01.484 --> 15:04.611
Liberty DeVitto, some people
may not know,

15:04.612 --> 15:08.990
but this guy has got 30 plus
years with the same artist.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.368
Now, in the hired gun business,

15:11.369 --> 15:13.537
three years is a lot.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.497
Thirty, is unheard of.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.125
He, definitely is, one of those
guys that made

15:18.126 --> 15:19.793
the band he was in.

15:19.794 --> 15:23.092
Billy Joel sounded like Billy
Joel because of Liberty DeVitto.

15:23.093 --> 15:24.928

of that band.

15:24.929 --> 15:26.141
There's no question.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.218
Ow, right here,

15:28.219 --> 15:31.263
Topo Gigio, the Italian
drummer...

15:31.264 --> 15:33.813
[Liberty] When you see a Billy Joel
album, if you look at the back

15:33.814 --> 15:36.903
of The Stranger, it will say,
"Words and music by Billy Joel."

15:36.904 --> 15:38.103
It won't say,

15:38.104 --> 15:39.856
"Music arranged by..."

15:40.314 --> 15:41.356
anywhere.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.859
Because we all
arranged the songs.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.819
Only The Good Die Young,

15:45.820 --> 15:47.988
he wrote it as a Reggae tune.

15:47.989 --> 15:50.037
And then, I'm like,
"This is terrible.

15:50.038 --> 15:51.867
It's really bad."

15:51.868 --> 15:53.370
I looked at Billy and I said,

15:53.371 --> 15:55.665
"You know, the closest you've
ever been to Jamaica is,

15:55.666 --> 15:59.338

16:04.714 --> 16:07.680
was I always loved the song
called Up From The Skies,

16:07.681 --> 16:11.141
that is on the Jimi Hendrix,
Axis: Bold as Love album,

16:11.142 --> 16:13.560

about that song when I said,

16:20.234 --> 16:21.813
"Let's do it this way."

[Hook] I had spent my entire younger years
trying to develop some kind of skill

16:59.685 --> 17:00.732
Playing guitar.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.568
That's the only thing
I cared about.

17:06.569 --> 17:09.819
I practiced hours and hours
and hours a clay.

17:09.819 --> 17:12.196
Not because I wanted
to make sure I was good,

17:12.198 --> 17:14.074
I played because I
really loved it.

17:14.075 --> 17:15.242
It was fun.

17:15.242 --> 17:16.914
You could hear yourself
getting better.

17:16.915 --> 17:19.538
You could pick up things that
you couldn't do a week ago.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.748
By the time
I was moving to LA

17:21.749 --> 17:24.251
I knew I had
a certain skill level.

17:24.252 --> 17:27.503
So, any opportunity I had to
mingle with other musicians,

17:27.505 --> 17:28.800
and get up and play,
be in it...

17:28.801 --> 17:30.596
I was like three bands,
four bands at a time.

17:30.597 --> 17:32.637
I had played Tuesday nights
with this band,

17:32.638 --> 17:35.058
I had played three nights
with this band... local stuff.

17:35.059 --> 17:37.556
Well, eventually, what
happened was,

17:37.557 --> 17:41.061
one of the musicians in one of these
bands said, "Hey, you know, um,

17:42.520 --> 17:45.818
Mandy Moore is looking
for an acoustic guitar player.

17:45.819 --> 17:48.238
And I think that'd you'd
be perfect for the gig."

17:51.779 --> 17:54.658
Jason got the Mandy Moore gig and I
remember thinking, "Good for you."

17:54.659 --> 17:58.080
I mean, it's a little lighter than what I
thought he would probably go for but...

17:58.081 --> 18:00.373
He was working, making a good
living.

18:00.374 --> 18:03.671
[Hook] People might not understand
me in the Mandy Moore gig,

18:03.672 --> 18:07.961
but all I thought was, like, "Part
one of the plan in motion."

18:07.962 --> 18:11.510
Like most of those gigs, I'm
not in control of it at all.

18:11.511 --> 18:14.009
Right, I'm just the rented
guitar player.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.677
So...

18:15.678 --> 18:19.306
At some point they decided to do
some left turn with business,

18:19.307 --> 18:20.650
she was going to go
make a movie,

18:20.651 --> 18:22.517
or we're going to shut down
the music part...

18:22.518 --> 18:24.814
She was going to focus
on acting or whatever...

18:24.815 --> 18:26.405
Whatever the reason was.

18:26.406 --> 18:29.316
And you, just in one
nano second,

18:29.317 --> 18:30.817
you're job is over.

18:30.818 --> 18:33.162
And then you start
to realize, "Hmm, okay.

18:33.163 --> 18:35.373
There is no security here."

18:48.377 --> 18:51.092
When you're a kid, you're like,
"I want to be a rock star.

18:51.093 --> 18:52.260
I want to be a rock star."

18:52.261 --> 18:54.215
I never said that.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.763
I always said I want
to be a session guy.

18:56.764 --> 18:59.351
To be a studio musician,
to be a great studio musician,

18:59.352 --> 19:00.894
you have
to be a great musician.

19:00.895 --> 19:02.474
I mean, you just do.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.728
There's just no two ways about
it. You can't be mediocre.

19:04.729 --> 19:05.810
Because there's,

19:05.811 --> 19:07.734
you know, good
is the enemy of great.

19:07.735 --> 19:09.397
So, if you're only good,

19:09.398 --> 19:11.399
there's a thousand great guys
that are gonna take your place.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.994
[Robinson] Our producer wants
to cast the right people

19:13.995 --> 19:16.446
for the right role
of this record.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.700
So, they go out and they
find the best player

19:18.701 --> 19:20.367
that fits the role.

19:20.368 --> 19:22.077
They find the best guy
for the drums,

19:22.078 --> 19:23.703
they find the best guy
for the bass, they find

19:23.704 --> 19:24.874
the best guy
with the keyboards,

19:24.875 --> 19:26.465
they find the best guy
for the guitars.

19:26.466 --> 19:29.417
But they also want these guys,

19:29.418 --> 19:32.754
to be able to blend
as if they were in a band.

19:32.755 --> 19:35.552
The guys on the record
not playing on the record,

19:35.553 --> 19:36.766
never cross my mind.

19:36.767 --> 19:38.510
In fact, when someone go,

19:38.511 --> 19:41.433
"You know, that's not even,
whatever Ace Frehley playing that?"

19:41.434 --> 19:43.101
That's so and so... That's...
Than"

19:43.102 --> 19:45.189
"I don't think that's Joe
Perry." It's so and so...

19:45.190 --> 19:47.562
I go, "Well, how is that
possible?"

19:47.563 --> 19:51.398
It never even crossed my mind
that that ever went on.

19:51.399 --> 19:55.241
If you look at the whole dynamic
of the L.A sessions scene,

19:55.242 --> 19:58.076
all of us in that generation
that-that replaced,

19:58.077 --> 19:59.870
obviously, the generation
before us.

19:59.871 --> 20:02.534
We were all aspiring studio
musicians.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.414
Everybody who was anybody had to
go through the record playing.

20:05.415 --> 20:08.041
So, I had my guitar in one hand,
my amp in the other hand,

20:08.042 --> 20:09.708
and my opening line

20:09.709 --> 20:11.584
which is the same line
I'd use to sell songs was,

20:11.585 --> 20:13.804
"You can sit here and I could
tell you how great you are

20:13.805 --> 20:16.005
and we could talk
for 20 minutes,

20:16.006 --> 20:17.804
or you could just let me play for five
minutes and I could get out of your hair.

20:17.805 --> 20:21.598
We didn't carry ourselves like
rock stars might carry themselves.

20:21.599 --> 20:23.435
We took a lot of shit
for it in the press.

20:23.436 --> 20:26.522
They made it, like, being a
session musician was bad.

20:26.523 --> 20:29.189
"Anybody can do that. You just
sit and read music all clay."

20:29.190 --> 20:32.190
Well, I said, "No man,
that's not what we did.

20:32.191 --> 20:34.442
We often times
polished the turd."

20:35.776 --> 20:38.987

there were pro's.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.114
I'm a studio musician.

20:41.115 --> 20:45.495
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. I've
gotta save this, now, in real time.

20:45.496 --> 20:47.203
That's my job.

20:47.204 --> 20:51.084
[Foster] Jay Graydon and I have
been buddies for 45 years.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.629
I came into a club and I saw
him play,

20:54.630 --> 20:56.551
and I had just moved
to Los Angeles.

20:56.552 --> 20:59.841
I was so in awe of what I heard
and what I saw.

20:59.842 --> 21:02.220
This amazing
technician with heart.

21:02.221 --> 21:03.720
We became fast friends,

21:03.721 --> 21:07.640
and have worked together
over the decades ever since.

21:07.641 --> 21:10.064
[Vai] Jay is like a
forensic scientist.

21:10.065 --> 21:12.103
He is so in to what he does,

21:12.104 --> 21:16.152
and he has such an inner ear
for production and for playing.

21:16.153 --> 21:18.490
You know, obviously,
he's a great player.

21:18.491 --> 21:21.080
I'm working with Roger Nichols.
He's a recording engineer.

21:21.081 --> 21:25.033
And he realized I was a good
player in his eyes and said,

21:25.034 --> 21:28.457
"Steely Dan's having a really hard
time with this one guitar solo.

21:28.458 --> 21:30.544
I'm gonna recommend
you for the gig."

21:30.545 --> 21:32.883
And I said, "Roger, that
would be great."

21:32.884 --> 21:35.418
Because every studio musician,

21:35.419 --> 21:38.171
wants to be on a Steely
Dan record.

21:38.172 --> 21:40.256
This is as good as it gets.

21:40.257 --> 21:43.384
Whether you like
that band or not,

21:43.385 --> 21:46.389
you know that if they were ever
on a Steely Dan record,

21:46.390 --> 21:48.603
they are one of the baddest
motherfuckers walking.

21:48.604 --> 21:51.944
[Jay] I am five milliseconds away from
crashing in the middle of the solo

21:51.945 --> 21:53.353
and hitting a wall.

21:53.354 --> 21:56.028
So I'll take a chance
and I'll step on my dick.

21:56.029 --> 21:58.483
Fagen says to me,
the key words,

21:58.484 --> 21:59.576
"Think blues."

22:16.919 --> 22:21.047
And when I walked out of there I
had no idea I was the final guy.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.800
I'm thinking, "Well, I'm just probably
just another guy they're going to try."

22:23.801 --> 22:25.640
I know I was the seventh guy.

22:25.641 --> 22:28.388
And they were gonna, "Who's
eight, who's ninth, who's tenth?"

22:28.389 --> 22:29.722
They loved the solo.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.808
Record comes out and I'm on it.

22:31.809 --> 22:34.269
And I'm going,
"Eh, good, I won!"

22:34.270 --> 22:36.479
So, good for me.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.279
[Lukather] I was the guy that was, like,
if I said that's a hit record it was clue.

22:39.280 --> 22:42.654

almost didn't make the record.

I heard just the lyric and I cracked up,
and I went, "Beat It! Oh, yeah, that's...

22:53.131 --> 22:54.789
destined for a hit."

22:54.790 --> 22:57.213
And I played all the guitar
parts, and the bass parts.

22:57.214 --> 23:00.128

23:00.129 --> 23:02.922

23:02.923 --> 23:06.640
I said if this song's a hit I would run
naked down Hollywood boulevard, okay.

23:06.641 --> 23:09.730
Fortunately, at this point nobody's
ever called me out on that, but...

23:09.731 --> 23:11.890
We're seeing reviews saying

23:11.891 --> 23:16.192
Quincy Jones manages to get the members
of Toto to play with some kind of taste.

23:16.193 --> 23:17.770
On, you know, Thriller,

23:17.771 --> 23:23.151
They just hated the fact that
we were on something so huge.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.904
[Foster] Most of us didn't stay
as studio musicians very long.

23:25.905 --> 23:29.034
We realized that it was kind of a dead
end even though it was a great living.

23:29.035 --> 23:31.034
But it was a dead end.

23:31.035 --> 23:33.538
And all of us would watch the producers
on the other side of the glass.

23:33.539 --> 23:35.665
And I just know, me personally,
I was going, like,

23:35.666 --> 23:39.381
"Wow, I know I can do that. I'm
positive I can do what they're doing."

23:39.382 --> 23:41.672
They're relying on us
to come up with the music.

23:41.673 --> 23:43.466
Anyway, so, I'm
sure I can do that.

23:43.467 --> 23:45.428
I went from six figures a year,

23:45.429 --> 23:48.847
to the first year I produced,
I made a total of $5000.

23:48.848 --> 23:51.097
Three albums.
All three of them stiffed.

23:51.098 --> 23:52.847
No sales. No nothing.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.312
And I was very discouraged.

23:54.313 --> 23:56.142
Because I used to think that,

23:56.143 --> 23:58.645
producing meant just getting a
bunch of great musicians together

23:58.646 --> 23:59.734
and making a great track.

23:59.735 --> 24:01.107
But it's not what producing is.

24:01.108 --> 24:03.985
Producing, fundamentally,
is finding great songs

24:03.986 --> 24:05.529
and pairing them
with great artists.

24:05.530 --> 24:07.654
And I didn't have that part
together yet.

24:07.655 --> 24:08.947
The break out,

24:08.948 --> 24:11.076
was when I met Earth,
Wind and Fire.

24:11.077 --> 24:13.034
And again that ties
in to jay Graydon

24:13.035 --> 24:15.754
because we wrote After the love is
Gone together along with Bill Chaplin.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.960

24:21.961 --> 24:24.339
And it just...
It propelled me into the 80s,

24:24.340 --> 24:25.880
into, uh,

24:25.881 --> 24:28.508
Alice Cooper, and Chicago,
and Chaka Khan,

24:28.509 --> 24:30.305
and Kenny Rogers
and Kenny Loggins...

24:30.306 --> 24:31.770
It was in a hell of a decade.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.444
I got called by Tommy LiPuma
at Warner Brothers

24:39.445 --> 24:41.813
to produce George Benson.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.192
I've got four days
to come up with a song.

24:44.193 --> 24:45.441
After two days,

24:45.442 --> 24:47.026
I have nothing.

24:47.027 --> 24:49.906
I'm trying to write something
and I'm just a blank.

24:49.907 --> 24:51.619
I don't have anything I like.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.412
I came over and he goes, "Well,
let's write a song for Benson."

24:54.413 --> 24:56.750
And then afterwards, you know,
we'd hang.

24:56.751 --> 24:58.496
"See if you can come up
with a verse?"

24:58.497 --> 25:01.044
I said, like, "I'm just going to
walk away for 20, 30 minutes.

25:01.045 --> 25:02.291
I'll just go do something.

25:02.292 --> 25:03.885
And I'll come back
and see where you're at."

25:03.886 --> 25:06.170
And I came up with a, you
know...

25:06.171 --> 25:07.923
[playing piano]

25:14.513 --> 25:18.186
I had come back and he's got
the intro and the verse nailed.

25:18.187 --> 25:21.149
And I'm going, "This is great.
This tune is shaping up great."

25:21.150 --> 25:23.316
And I came up with that part,
and he says,

25:23.317 --> 25:25.441
"Hey, man, I gotta take a shit.
I'll be right back."

25:27.317 --> 25:28.785
I'm sitting on the shitter,

25:29.361 --> 25:30.528
I pop a deuce,

25:30.529 --> 25:32.497
and the melody comes
into my head.

25:32.498 --> 25:33.948
I've got the groove,

25:33.949 --> 25:35.283
I've got the melody,

25:35.284 --> 25:36.706
I've got the bass part...

25:36.707 --> 25:39.078
I've got the chorus
to the song.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.876
And I'm going, "I've got to get off
the can as fast as I can, man."

25:41.877 --> 25:43.467
I'm doing my best
to get off the can.

25:43.468 --> 25:45.334
And as fast as I can!

25:45.335 --> 25:46.711
And he comes back,

25:46.712 --> 25:49.215
and he starts singing
Turn Your Love Around.

25:49.216 --> 25:51.260

because Jay when he'd...

26:22.206 --> 26:24.421
I want to see my face
on the TV screen.

26:24.422 --> 26:26.544
My mama didn't understand
what I was doing.

26:26.545 --> 26:28.544
I came home with a record
one time...

26:28.545 --> 26:29.670
and I was so excited.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.344
And she would look
at the record and go,

26:32.800 --> 26:34.509
"I don't see you."

26:34.510 --> 26:37.432

Well, why don't you see me?

26:40.561 --> 26:42.058
And so, one day I thought
about it.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.686
I said, "Well, you know what?
I gotta cut a record

26:43.687 --> 26:45.812

Well, I did it.

26:45.813 --> 26:47.730
I've started writing songs,

26:47.731 --> 26:50.860
then I decided to cut my own music
which I thought I was going to record

27:13.719 --> 27:17.557
So he heard it, he loved it, and we
sold almost two million of those.

27:17.558 --> 27:19.392

27:19.393 --> 27:21.231

27:21.232 --> 27:23.182
And it's more important,

27:23.183 --> 27:24.976
to have a classic song

27:24.977 --> 27:26.775
that is to have a number one

songs like, of course,
Stranglehold.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.788
The song I wrote, Hey Baby,

34:42.789 --> 34:44.879
songs like
just What The Doctor Ordered.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.920
That's me singing
all that stuff.

34:46.920 --> 34:49.797
One night a man in the audience
comes up to me and he goes,

34:49.797 --> 34:52.174
"Man, I'm sorry Ted's throat
wasn't feeling good tonight,

34:52.175 --> 34:55.393
but, you did a really good job
singing the songs."

34:55.393 --> 35:01.098
So, the next time you hear this song
you're gonna know it was my voice.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.271
And not somebody else's.

Kenny, man...

37:19.154 --> 37:21.657
I love Kenny.
He's got an energy, man.

37:21.658 --> 37:23.657
One of the most
working dudes, right?

37:23.658 --> 37:25.454
Oh, that guy is so energetic!

37:25.455 --> 37:26.578
Kenny Aronoff, uh...

37:27.454 --> 37:28.954
He loud.

37:28.955 --> 37:31.123
I worked with him
one time. He's loud.

37:31.124 --> 37:32.124
Fucking loud!

37:35.879 --> 37:38.219
He's a really well schooled
musician.

37:38.220 --> 37:40.637
To the point where
he writes out all of his parts.

37:40.638 --> 37:42.885
He's kind of like the Godfather

37:42.886 --> 37:45.012
of the hired gun of drums.

37:45.013 --> 37:47.391
I mean, he was doing this shit
when I was in junior high.

38:00.987 --> 38:03.081
[Kenny] Now, I grew up
in a small town of 3000.

38:03.082 --> 38:07.201
How the fuck do you get
out of a town of 3000

38:07.202 --> 38:10.832
into The Beatles, and on stage,
and touring and making records?

38:10.833 --> 38:11.955
I didn't know.

38:11.956 --> 38:14.880
I was gardening at 50 cents
an hour.

38:15.502 --> 38:16.919
Gardening!

38:16.920 --> 38:19.421
And I saved up
for the snare drum,

38:19.422 --> 38:21.131
and the cymbal.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.053
All I knew was I wanted
to be in The Beatles.

38:23.054 --> 38:25.019
So the only thing I do
is I started a band.

38:26.054 --> 38:28.388
I did five years at university.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.608
I was practicing nine hours
a day,

38:30.609 --> 38:34.144
and playing five nights a week
in a Jazz trio.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.522
One day I'm sitting eating
dinner,

38:36.523 --> 38:37.856
I'm about to walk out and I go,

38:37.857 --> 38:39.483
"You know, I should just
chill for a second."

38:39.484 --> 38:41.235
Had I not chilled for a second

38:41.236 --> 38:44.202
I wouldn't have run into this
singer/songwriter who said,

38:44.203 --> 38:45.948
"You know this guy
johnny Cougar?

38:45.949 --> 38:47.658
He's looking for a drummer."

38:47.659 --> 38:49.878
So they said, "Do you know any
of the songs on the record?"

38:49.879 --> 38:51.453
I said, "I'm familiar

38:51.454 --> 38:52.663
with the album."

38:52.664 --> 38:54.585
They picked a song,
I tore it up.

38:54.586 --> 38:56.503
Broke a cymbal,
sticks flying...

38:56.504 --> 38:57.965
Looking at me smiling,

38:57.966 --> 38:59.554
shakes my hand and goes,

38:59.555 --> 39:01.129
"Welcome to hell!"

39:01.130 --> 39:03.132
I'm like, "Well,
what does he mean by that?"

39:03.800 --> 39:05.759
Well, I found out.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.855
And five weeks later we were going
to go to L.A to make a record.

39:08.856 --> 39:11.265
In one day
I was off the record.

39:11.266 --> 39:12.893
Life changing moment for me.

39:12.894 --> 39:14.610
Huge life changing moment!

39:14.611 --> 39:16.520
John tells me,

39:16.521 --> 39:17.938
"Well, you know,

39:17.939 --> 39:20.986
Kroppa wants to get this song,
this album done fast.

39:20.987 --> 39:23.362
You haven't had quite enough
experience in the studio."

39:23.363 --> 39:24.945
And I'm thinking, "No,

39:24.946 --> 39:28.869
no, no, no, no, no. This is not
going to go down this way."

39:28.870 --> 39:32.041
"And, you know, you go home,
and..." And I just went,

39:32.042 --> 39:33.379
"Am I your drummer!"

39:34.956 --> 39:36.378
I'm going, "Did I just say
that?"

39:37.208 --> 39:38.380
"I'm not going home."

39:39.460 --> 39:40.382
"Am I your drummer?"

39:40.383 --> 39:43.088
And he goes, "Uh, uh, uh, uh...

39:43.089 --> 39:44.056
Yeah, it's just..."

39:44.057 --> 39:45.924
"Well, find me a drummer.

39:45.925 --> 39:48.269
I'm gonna go to the studio. I'm gonna
watch these guys play my parts

39:48.270 --> 39:49.975
and I'm gonna
benefit from that.

39:49.976 --> 39:52.723
And you're gonna benefit
because I'm your drummer.

39:52.724 --> 39:53.976
Because I'm gonna get better.

39:53.977 --> 39:55.934
And that's good for you.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.025
You don't have to pay me,
I'll sleep on the floor.

39:58.026 --> 39:59.523
But I ain't going home."

39:59.524 --> 40:00.898
He didn't know what to say,

40:00.899 --> 40:02.983
he went, "Uh... All right."

40:02.984 --> 40:05.988
I did stay and I did watch,
and I took notes.

40:05.989 --> 40:10.699
And that was the beginning
of a 45 degree angle

40:10.700 --> 40:12.623
of my career which is still
going

40:12.624 --> 40:14.286
at 45 degrees.

40:14.287 --> 40:15.832
He's just a creative drummer.

40:15.833 --> 40:18.582
You know, the thing in jack
And Diane that he does...

40:18.583 --> 40:21.211
I don't care if it was like pulling
teeth to get it out of him.

40:21.212 --> 40:23.133
He made it up.
It's brilliant.

40:23.134 --> 40:24.671
That's Kenny Aronoff.

40:24.672 --> 40:28.389
And, that drum fill right there
is that guy's personality.

40:28.390 --> 40:29.635
"Aronoff, get in here.

40:29.636 --> 40:31.013
We need a drum solo."

40:31.014 --> 40:32.429
I'm like, "What!"

40:32.430 --> 40:34.144
On a ballad?" I'm thinking,

40:34.145 --> 40:36.484
"How do you do a drum solo
on a song that's like...

40:37.268 --> 40:38.810
A little diddy,

40:38.811 --> 40:41.104
about jack and Diane...

40:41.105 --> 40:43.774
You can't go..."
[imitating drums]

40:43.775 --> 40:47.780
Because nobody had done that.
Yeah, except for Phil Collins.

40:47.781 --> 40:49.998
You know, I'm walking towards
the drums, I'm going,

40:49.999 --> 40:52.866
"You got 25 feet to save your
career.

40:52.867 --> 40:53.993
You got 20,

40:54.953 --> 40:56.079
fifteen,

40:56.704 --> 40:57.871
ten.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.292
What are you
going to do, Kenny?

40:59.293 --> 41:00.540
What are you going to do?"

41:00.541 --> 41:02.167
I'm at the drum stool facing
that way...

41:02.168 --> 41:03.465
"Five." Now I'm like,

41:04.253 --> 41:05.629
"What am I gonna do?"

41:05.630 --> 41:07.849
Ding! Something
pops into my head.

41:07.850 --> 41:09.183
[drums playing]

41:14.514 --> 41:16.733
That was it. This short
little concise thing.

41:17.642 --> 41:18.892
John's like,

41:18.893 --> 41:21.108
"Groove, stop playing
the beats."

41:21.109 --> 41:22.902
So, you know...
[imitating drums]

41:24.691 --> 41:26.568
That song goes to number one.

41:26.569 --> 41:28.819
Instead of getting excited,

41:28.820 --> 41:30.362
I shit my pants.

41:30.363 --> 41:32.489
Because down I'm going, like,

41:32.490 --> 41:35.283
"Now you have to be,
number one,

41:35.284 --> 41:37.536
and you have to do it again."

41:37.537 --> 41:38.914
And I don't know if I'm that...

41:38.915 --> 41:41.248
Am I good enough to do that
again?

41:41.249 --> 41:43.420
[Liberty] I think out
of all the drummers,

41:43.421 --> 41:45.210
when you people used to say,

41:45.211 --> 41:47.553
"If there was somebody to take your
place with Billy who would it be?

41:47.554 --> 41:49.140
And Kenny was the only one
I could think of.

41:49.141 --> 41:51.226
Because I think me and him
play a lot alike.

41:51.227 --> 41:54.094
Very aggressive
and to the song.

41:54.095 --> 41:55.267
The great thing about it...

41:55.268 --> 41:56.680
About Kenny is...

41:56.681 --> 41:58.896
He is never satisfied
with himself.

41:58.897 --> 42:01.688
So he will always give
you that extra bit.

42:01.689 --> 42:03.279
He'll bother you to do it.

42:13.322 --> 42:16.369
[Billy] I traveled around
with guys in my band.

42:16.370 --> 42:17.912
It's like a New York street
gang.

42:17.913 --> 42:20.000
But we kind of keep each other
down to Earth.

42:20.001 --> 42:23.043
We're always putting each other down,
and smacking each other around.

42:23.044 --> 42:25.462
And we keep ourselves in line
like that.

42:25.463 --> 42:27.631
[Russell]
We took a band attitude.

42:27.632 --> 42:30.097
We took a family attitude
to what we did.

42:30.098 --> 42:34.134
Those tracks and those tours,
and that whole trajectory

42:34.135 --> 42:36.470
of what happened with Billy...

42:36.471 --> 42:38.561
That was part
of our legacy too.

42:38.562 --> 42:40.900
We all had a lot of laughs
and a lot of fun,

42:40.901 --> 42:43.101
but, uh, I'd heard

42:43.102 --> 42:46.356
a little scuttlebutt. You know,
that on the business side,

42:47.148 --> 42:48.491
there was a lot of weird,

42:49.901 --> 42:51.651
vibes going around.

42:51.652 --> 42:55.077
That's when he found out that his
manager screwed him out of money.

42:55.078 --> 42:57.542
I mean, there
was millions lost.

42:58.242 --> 42:59.868
Millions!

42:59.869 --> 43:01.337
That will make you paranoid.

43:01.338 --> 43:03.663
Make you not trust anybody.

43:03.664 --> 43:06.588
Charges in the lawsuit
are that they paid kickbacks

43:06.589 --> 43:08.835
to Billy Joel's manager,

43:08.836 --> 43:11.379
but never reported this
to Mr. Joel.

43:11.380 --> 43:15.592
As a result of this Mr. Joel
did not fire the manager

43:15.593 --> 43:18.563
until after he purported
to defraud Mr. Joel

43:18.564 --> 43:20.972
out of tens of millions
of dollars.

43:20.973 --> 43:22.941
When I got the phone call
from Billy,

43:22.942 --> 43:26.728
he was... so... such a wreck.
He was broke.

43:26.729 --> 43:28.105
He had no money.

43:28.106 --> 43:29.403
He was, like,

43:30.233 --> 43:31.525
broke!

43:31.526 --> 43:33.318
The thing he said to me

43:33.319 --> 43:36.154
was "I want everything back.

43:36.155 --> 43:38.907
You're not gonna get that
payment anymore on the records.

43:38.908 --> 43:41.999
You're not gonna get
a percentage of the gross."

43:42.000 --> 43:45.919
And then he got this accounting firm
that was watching out for his money.

43:45.920 --> 43:47.624
And they decided that,

43:47.625 --> 43:50.418
"Well, you're name's
on the marquee.

43:50.419 --> 43:52.590
Why are you paying these guys
so much money?

43:52.591 --> 43:54.181
You can get anybody you want."

43:54.182 --> 43:57.467
And that's really when
it started to get weird.

43:57.468 --> 44:00.722
I was tired of being pegged, I
was tired of being stereotyped.

44:00.723 --> 44:01.972
Tired of being pigeon holed.

44:01.973 --> 44:03.270
Tired of being bagged.

44:03.271 --> 44:04.766
[woman] As what?

44:04.767 --> 44:07.394
As Billy Joel and his band
and his producer.

44:07.395 --> 44:10.899
And, no matter how much
of a different album we put out

44:10.900 --> 44:12.024
from the album before,

44:12.692 --> 44:13.692
um,

44:14.527 --> 44:15.824
it wasn't enough.

44:16.821 --> 44:18.915
[Russell] On The Bridge album,

44:20.449 --> 44:22.951
I could kind of feel that,

44:22.952 --> 44:24.454
it was coming to an end.

44:24.455 --> 44:26.421
There was an undercurrent
there that I kinda,

44:27.623 --> 44:29.337
in the back of my mind, you
know...

44:29.338 --> 44:31.254
I could see the writing
on the wall.

44:31.255 --> 44:33.298
I never felt it.
I thought we were gonna go on

44:33.299 --> 44:35.390
and, you know,
continue to go on.

44:35.391 --> 44:38.550
But we were in Australia
and Billy said to me,

44:38.551 --> 44:42.518
"What if I go in the studio with
just you and all new players?"

44:42.519 --> 44:45.729
And I was like, "Man, what are you
gonna do with the other guys?"

44:45.730 --> 44:48.069
You know, he goes, "How am I
gonna get any new players?"

44:48.070 --> 44:49.936
He just... cut them loose.

44:49.937 --> 44:52.272
Now I've got three children
and I'm married,

44:52.273 --> 44:53.650
and I'm like, "What am
I gonna say?

44:53.651 --> 44:56.067
Well, I quit. I'm out."

44:56.068 --> 44:59.491
We weren't making that much money
that I'm a millionaire, you know.

44:59.492 --> 45:02.410
[Russell] The way it would work is
that we would do a tour or whatever,

45:02.411 --> 45:04.661
and then you wait around
and you get the call.

45:04.662 --> 45:06.536
And you go in.
There's a new batch of songs

45:06.537 --> 45:08.538
and you go bang em' out.

45:08.539 --> 45:12.005
So, you know, we were kind
of in that holding pattern.

45:12.006 --> 45:14.923
And one day I'm driving around
and I hear on the radio

45:14.924 --> 45:16.889
that Billy's got a new band
and a new album.

45:16.890 --> 45:18.423
I said, "What?"

45:18.424 --> 45:21.096
I called up Doug, "You're
not gonna believe this."

45:21.097 --> 45:22.510
And that's how I found out.

45:22.511 --> 45:24.605
Nobody ever said a word to me
after all those years.

45:24.606 --> 45:27.224
[Liberty] I knew it was
going to announced on MTV

45:27.225 --> 45:31.981
that Billy Joel was going in with just
me and a whole new bunch of players.

45:31.982 --> 45:34.022
The guys didn't know yet.

45:34.023 --> 45:36.149
And I told Billy, I said,

45:36.150 --> 45:38.693
"You gotta call these guys
and tell them what's going on."

45:38.694 --> 45:41.072
And he was like, "I don't have
to do shit. I'm Billy Joel."

45:42.698 --> 45:44.869
[Billy] It was just time
to do something different.

45:44.870 --> 45:47.120
I worked with a different
co-producer,

45:47.121 --> 45:51.124
and I worked with some different
musicians for the first time since 77.

45:54.543 --> 45:56.670
[Russell] Doug and I got
let go at the same time.

45:56.671 --> 45:59.422
I mean, I remember
calling Doug,

45:59.423 --> 46:01.517
to tell him what I heard
on the radio.

46:01.518 --> 46:04.511
You know, you think that you
know...

46:04.512 --> 46:06.433
If you work for a company
that many years

46:06.434 --> 46:08.056
you get a watch and a pension.

46:08.057 --> 46:09.354
So, um!

46:09.850 --> 46:11.101
You know,

46:11.102 --> 46:12.445
I didn't even get a phone call.

46:13.187 --> 46:15.438
Russell was upset,

46:15.439 --> 46:18.534
you know, I think it still
gets under his skin.

46:18.535 --> 46:23.321
I can honestly say that I never had
any animosity towards Liberty.

46:23.322 --> 46:25.871
It's just... I just didn't get
it. You know, I just...

46:25.872 --> 46:27.617
You know, here we are,

46:27.618 --> 46:31.373
you know, we're all brothers
and now we're kind of out...

46:31.374 --> 46:32.917
of the loop here.
It was just...

46:32.918 --> 46:35.885
You know, it was... That was
the toughest pill to swallow!

46:35.886 --> 46:38.128
You either accept
it and move on

46:38.129 --> 46:39.671
or you don't.

46:39.672 --> 46:43.758
You are no longer the person
that you were the day before.

46:43.759 --> 46:47.470
You're no longer
in Billy Joel's band.

46:47.471 --> 46:49.306
You're no longer,

46:49.307 --> 46:50.765
going on tour.

46:50.766 --> 46:53.770
You're no longer playing
at Madison Square garden.

46:53.771 --> 46:56.938
Your identity is totally gone
now.

46:56.939 --> 46:59.316
You're still the guy
that played on the records,

46:59.317 --> 47:02.696
but you're not that person
that you were the day before.

47:02.697 --> 47:07.032
And Doug had a very,
very difficult time with that.

47:07.033 --> 47:10.827
[Russell] Doug tried and
tried and tried to move on,

47:10.828 --> 47:15.459
but... His life just kept taking steps
backwards instead of steps forward.

47:15.460 --> 47:17.042
Then I went out,

47:17.043 --> 47:19.919
to do a gig and then I came
home,

47:19.920 --> 47:22.172
and my wife then
was crying on the couch,

47:22.173 --> 47:24.132
and something had happened
in the afternoon.

47:24.133 --> 47:26.475
I said, "Come on, you're still crying
over what happened this afternoon?"

47:26.476 --> 47:28.312
She goes, "No,
Doug Stegmeyer killed himself."

47:33.225 --> 47:35.315
Every time I spoke
to Doug on the phone,

47:35.316 --> 47:37.776
it was always, "Hi, how
are you doing?

47:37.777 --> 47:38.817
What's going on?"

47:38.818 --> 47:40.862
Blah, blah, blah... Small talk.

47:40.863 --> 47:42.817
And then,

47:42.818 --> 47:46.071
you know, "Yeah, I'm having a hard
time paying for this." Or whatever...

47:46.072 --> 47:48.746
"You at least... you still got
your fucking gig with Billy!

47:48.747 --> 47:50.241
Fucking..." You know,

47:50.242 --> 47:53.041
"I fucking lost my gig
and you got your fucking gig.

47:53.042 --> 47:55.080
Remember, I got you that gig."

47:55.081 --> 47:57.082
And I was like, "Holy shit!"

47:57.083 --> 47:59.709
So, the one time
that he called,

47:59.710 --> 48:02.257
I'm listening to him
on the answering machine,

48:02.258 --> 48:04.172
and I didn't pick
up the phone

48:04.173 --> 48:06.642
because I didn't want it to turn
into one of those phone calls again.

48:06.643 --> 48:08.682
And that's when he
ended his life.

48:18.813 --> 48:20.360
Doug did what
he did to himself.

48:22.650 --> 48:23.902
We all could have been...

48:25.069 --> 48:26.070
better,

48:26.779 --> 48:28.326
and helped him.

48:28.906 --> 48:30.365
But...

48:30.366 --> 48:32.960
It's something I still can't
come to grips with.

48:32.961 --> 48:35.250
I just don't understand,

48:36.122 --> 48:37.914
how you go there.

48:37.915 --> 48:40.009
It's been maybe one of the toughest
things I've had to deal with

48:40.010 --> 48:41.718
because I felt like
I lost my brother.

48:41.719 --> 48:42.882
And it's...

48:51.220 --> 48:52.312
That's it.

49:05.609 --> 49:08.156
[Rudy] Right before I got
the phone call from Ozzy,

49:08.157 --> 49:10.122
the lowest point in my life...

49:10.123 --> 49:12.699
I had just turned 30 years old.

49:12.700 --> 49:15.118
The way that the industry was,

49:15.119 --> 49:17.537
the music industry in those
days.

49:17.538 --> 49:19.372
Being thirty years old,

49:19.373 --> 49:23.042
being in a dinosaur
type of musical genre

49:23.043 --> 49:26.171
like we were doing in Quiet
Riot wasn't very promising.

49:26.172 --> 49:27.505
[laughs]

49:27.506 --> 49:29.257
You know, to say the least.

49:29.258 --> 49:33.678
But, what happened was that as I
was pursuing my musical career

49:33.679 --> 49:37.182
I was also pursuing my own
spirituality.

49:37.183 --> 49:38.766
You know...

49:38.767 --> 49:40.810
Finding the meaning of life,

49:40.811 --> 49:42.770
I made peace with God,

49:42.771 --> 49:45.482
that if I didn't make
it as a musician,

49:45.483 --> 49:46.649
it was all right.

49:46.650 --> 49:47.942
That's cool.

49:47.943 --> 49:50.533
But, as long as my fingers
kept moving

49:50.534 --> 49:52.076
I was gonna keep playing.

49:52.077 --> 49:54.157
And within days I got a call

49:54.158 --> 49:55.533
from Ozzy.

49:55.534 --> 50:00.038
That phone call came in
at the right moment.

50:00.039 --> 50:02.963
Joining Ozzy had a completely
different meaning to me

50:02.964 --> 50:04.959
that it would had had...

50:04.960 --> 50:07.463
if I didn't had
made peace with God.

50:09.048 --> 50:11.801
I understood the blessing
that it was.

50:18.599 --> 50:20.975
[Richard] I started my journey,

50:20.976 --> 50:25.230
in music as a hired gun
for Nine Inch nails.

50:25.231 --> 50:27.315
Trent had this record contract,

50:27.316 --> 50:29.237
and he said, "I saw you
in that band Collapse,

50:29.238 --> 50:31.074
and you were jumping
around the stage

50:31.075 --> 50:33.071
and you looked like you
were having a good time.

50:33.072 --> 50:36.115
Why don't you come
and join Nine Inch Nails

50:36.116 --> 50:39.914
and use it as a stepping board to
get out and do your own thing?"

50:39.915 --> 50:43.084
And I was, like, "Okay, cool.
This sounds like a great idea."

50:43.085 --> 50:44.671
There was no negotiation.

50:44.672 --> 50:46.543
It was, like, "Hey,
you want to go on tour?"

50:46.544 --> 50:47.919
"Sure." "Okay."

50:47.920 --> 50:50.218
I actually thought,
"I'm a part of this, right?

50:50.219 --> 50:54.259
I'm allowed to work with you
and make some guitar stuff."

50:54.260 --> 50:57.013
I had said to Trent, I said "But
when is the record coming out?

50:57.014 --> 50:59.227
He's like, "Well, I'm almost done.
I'm mastering it-II

50:59.228 --> 51:00.894
I'm, like, "Fuck, I
didn't play on it.

51:00.895 --> 51:03.062
Like, I didn't do
anything on it."

51:03.063 --> 51:05.650
I said, "Trent, man,
you're going to New Orleans.

51:05.651 --> 51:08.236
You're going to, you know,
to rebuild your whole life,

51:08.237 --> 51:10.233
rent a new house and put
a studio in it."

51:10.234 --> 51:13.945
And I'm going back home and living
with my mom in a basement!"

51:13.946 --> 51:15.697
And he's like,
he looked at me and he went,

51:15.698 --> 51:17.746
"Get off your butt,
and go write a record."

51:17.747 --> 51:19.493
So... I did.

51:24.039 --> 51:27.542
I had written this song called
Hey Man Nice Shot.

51:27.543 --> 51:30.962
There's a glass ceiling
in Nine Inch Nails.

51:30.963 --> 51:33.923
There was a glass ceiling
at that time of,

51:33.924 --> 51:37.093
even if you write
you're never gonna own it.

51:37.094 --> 51:39.304
I was making $400 a month.

51:39.305 --> 51:41.726
John had called me up,
who was their manager,

51:41.727 --> 51:42.894
and he said, "Hey,

51:42.895 --> 51:44.480
we're not seeing you that much,

51:44.481 --> 51:46.772
and we know you want
some more money.

51:46.773 --> 51:48.443
We're not really sure what
you're doing.

51:49.023 --> 51:51.024
But if you want,

51:51.025 --> 51:53.153
to make a little
bit more money,

51:53.154 --> 51:55.069
there's a pizzeria,

51:55.070 --> 51:57.038
at the bottom of Cielo Drive,

51:59.617 --> 52:01.618
and they're looking
for drivers.

52:01.619 --> 52:03.917
Would you want to go
make some money,

52:04.872 --> 52:06.249
as a pizza delivery boy?"

52:09.293 --> 52:11.591
I took my little song
Hey Man Nice Shot,

52:12.421 --> 52:14.088
I got a new manager,

52:14.089 --> 52:15.673
I've got a lawyer,

52:15.674 --> 52:18.894
and I'm now in negotiation
with five labels.

52:19.595 --> 52:20.687
What would you go at?

52:21.639 --> 52:22.856
The pizza?

52:25.100 --> 52:30.396
♪ A man ♪

52:30.397 --> 52:34.197
♪ Has gun ♪

52:35.861 --> 52:41.074
♪ Hey man ♪

52:41.075 --> 52:44.420
♪ Have fun ♪

52:47.498 --> 52:52.377
The power of having a great
song,

52:52.378 --> 52:55.052
and the fact that
you're the singer,

52:55.756 --> 52:58.091
changes everything.

52:58.092 --> 53:02.845
All of a sudden it goes
from me being hired gun,

53:02.846 --> 53:07.433
to me being the guy
who has to hire a band.

53:07.434 --> 53:11.270
And I get why Trent
was so heavy handed.

53:11.271 --> 53:14.524
Now I'm
in the hiring position.

53:14.525 --> 53:17.694
To this day I sit him down
and I say, "Listen,

53:17.695 --> 53:19.663
I'm not gonna offer you
anything.

53:19.664 --> 53:21.489
You're gonna go on tour,

53:21.490 --> 53:24.412
you're gonna have a fucking good
time playing music that I wrote,

53:24.413 --> 53:27.626
as the drummer, as the bass
player, as the guitar player,

53:27.627 --> 53:29.247
and that's what
you're gonna do."

53:29.248 --> 53:31.874
Oh, man, Filter was...

53:31.875 --> 53:34.219
It's almost laughable
what we got paid.

53:34.220 --> 53:36.003
We were...

53:36.004 --> 53:39.679
Of every band we toured with we
were the lowest paid band members,

53:39.680 --> 53:43.219
even if we were making
the most in guarantees.

53:43.220 --> 53:46.099
You know, as a hired gun
in a band at that level

53:46.100 --> 53:49.564
you're not getting paid enough
to sustain anything.

53:49.565 --> 53:51.024
Why are you in Filter?

53:51.025 --> 53:53.146
You know, what are you
doing down here, like...

53:53.147 --> 53:54.774
"We like to get in the muck.

53:54.775 --> 53:56.112
We like to get dirty.

53:56.113 --> 53:57.906
We play, fuckin', you know,

53:57.907 --> 53:59.235
shitty clubs.

53:59.236 --> 54:01.075
You know, we like
to keep it real.

54:01.076 --> 54:04.788
We have to do the paid meet
and greets unless they paid.

54:04.789 --> 54:07.535
Like, the fans are paying money
to meet the band.

54:07.536 --> 54:09.125
We don't see any
of that money.

54:09.126 --> 54:10.835
I didn't see any of that money.

54:10.836 --> 54:12.582
The singer keeps
all to himself.

54:12.583 --> 54:14.003
I like taking the money home.

54:14.004 --> 54:15.672
I like just keeping
it all at home.

54:15.673 --> 54:18.047
You know what I mean? Like I'm
not... I don't give a shit.

54:18.048 --> 54:19.922
Like, it's a bus,
stay on the bus.

54:19.923 --> 54:21.799
You don't need a fucking
hotel room.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.928
I'd rather just sit home
and not be in a band

54:23.929 --> 54:25.928
than have to deal with them
for another day.

54:25.929 --> 54:29.395
I know of guys that are hired
guns that have great,

54:29.396 --> 54:30.811
stories, great situations.

54:30.812 --> 54:31.856
They love their jobs.

54:33.687 --> 54:36.277
That in this situation
it wasn't for me.

54:36.278 --> 54:39.698
I had that aha moment
of, "ls this really worth it?"

54:39.699 --> 54:41.778
on stage, in Germany.

54:41.779 --> 54:45.452
The show starts just like any other show
and I'm running and jumping, whatever,

54:45.453 --> 54:48.039
and really just rocking out
and enjoying it,

54:48.040 --> 54:50.163
and I almost felt this wave
come over me,

54:51.163 --> 54:52.580
and I just...

54:52.581 --> 54:54.624
I straightened up,

54:54.625 --> 54:58.379
I turned to Jeff, our drummer,
and I just looked at him, I go,

54:58.380 --> 54:59.924
"This isn't fun anymore."

54:59.925 --> 55:02.175
Like, literally, that was the
moment where I was like,

55:02.176 --> 55:04.848
"I need to find my exit
from this project."

55:04.849 --> 55:08.387
And I was gone from the band
like, a month later.

55:08.388 --> 55:10.473
[woman] Yeah, so we'll
just start with the duo.

55:10.474 --> 55:11.474
You got it.

55:12.434 --> 55:14.185
[man] Rollin on one.

55:14.186 --> 55:15.859
The Philly cheese steak burger

55:15.860 --> 55:17.605
on a fresh baked bun.

55:17.606 --> 55:19.816
At Carl's Jr. and Hardy's.

55:19.817 --> 55:22.491
And, I now am the voice
on your TV and radio.

55:22.492 --> 55:24.987
If they need stuff read,
I read it.

55:24.988 --> 55:27.532
The grilled cheese breakfast
sandwich

55:27.533 --> 55:29.367
only at Carl's Jr.

55:29.368 --> 55:31.791
The most notable one
is the Carl's Jr. voice

55:31.792 --> 55:34.336
"Without us, some
guys would starve."

55:45.592 --> 55:48.766
On our second leg
of the Diary Of A Madman tour

55:48.767 --> 55:50.596
we started in Atlanta.

55:50.597 --> 55:53.646
We did one more show,
and our third show,

55:54.643 --> 55:56.936
was in Knoxville, Tennessee,

55:56.937 --> 56:01.482
which is the last time
that Randy Rhoads performed.

56:01.483 --> 56:04.655
A 25 year old guitar player,
lead guitarist for Ozzy's band,

56:04.656 --> 56:07.532
Randy Rhodes is dead
along with two other passengers

56:07.533 --> 56:10.533
in the single engine aircraft
that spun out,

56:10.534 --> 56:12.326
wing touching the tour bus,

56:12.327 --> 56:15.047
cart wheeling into a two storey house
that you see in the background.

56:17.082 --> 56:19.250
[Rudy] I wake up to this boom!

56:19.251 --> 56:21.672
This huge boom by the middle
of nowhere.

56:21.673 --> 56:23.885
I mean, the last time
I saw Randy,

56:23.886 --> 56:26.553
he was standing on the doorway
getting out of the bus...

56:26.554 --> 56:28.971
He was yelling, "Hey, come
on, Jim. Come on in.

56:28.972 --> 56:30.437
We're gonna go on a plane"

56:30.438 --> 56:33.014
Then I say, "You know
what, I just...

56:33.015 --> 56:35.438
I'm going to get out of my bunk
when we get to the hotel."

56:35.439 --> 56:38.019
And then it just lay
by the pool.

56:38.020 --> 56:39.437
And that's it.

56:39.438 --> 56:42.231
And I closed the curtains,

56:42.232 --> 56:44.108
and went back to sleep.

56:44.109 --> 56:46.362
That was the last time
I saw Randy.

56:46.363 --> 56:48.576
It's usually we were like
always hanging out together

56:48.577 --> 56:51.075
and do adventures
and do stuff together.

56:51.076 --> 56:54.201
This was the only time
that I decline,

56:54.202 --> 56:58.164
went back to sleep, and I wake
up to glass everywhere.

56:58.165 --> 57:00.041
There was glass shattered
everywhere.

57:00.042 --> 57:03.216
The window... The passenger
back window,

57:04.129 --> 57:06.714
was gone. And I...

57:06.715 --> 57:09.467
looked out and there was our
tour manager,

57:09.468 --> 57:14.013
Jake Duncan, on his knees
pulling his hair out,

57:14.014 --> 57:16.233
crying, "They're gone,
they're gone!"

57:16.234 --> 57:18.100
'III

57:18.101 --> 57:21.479
My thought, "We must have
been in a highway accident."

57:21.480 --> 57:24.905
The last thing that I could imagine
was that the plane hit us.

57:25.776 --> 57:27.073
And once you realize,

57:28.153 --> 57:29.820
what's going on...

57:29.821 --> 57:32.365
It's this huge hum...

57:32.366 --> 57:34.784
Hum... [humming]

57:34.785 --> 57:37.244
Really low frequency,

57:37.245 --> 57:39.622
takes over and I couldn't hear
anything.

57:39.623 --> 57:41.500
All I heard was a hum.

57:48.340 --> 57:49.840
There's no cellphones,

57:49.841 --> 57:52.181
there's no way to communicate
with any authorities

57:52.182 --> 57:55.772
like the fire department or the
police, or anybody to come and help.

57:55.773 --> 58:00.226
The plane, the Cessna just
crashed through some trees...

58:00.227 --> 58:05.231
and exploded on impact on the garage
that was attached to the house.

58:05.232 --> 58:07.358
So the house was also on fire.

58:07.359 --> 58:09.699
We thought, "No, they must've
jumped off the plane.

58:09.700 --> 58:12.492
They must be somewhere,
maybe on a tree or something."

58:12.493 --> 58:14.412
You know, we couldn't just...

58:14.413 --> 58:18.119
accept the reality of it, you
know,

58:18.120 --> 58:21.670
that they had crashed
inside the plane...

58:24.501 --> 58:27.721
And their bodies were burning as
we were listening to the fire.

58:35.554 --> 58:37.847
That was...

58:37.848 --> 58:40.226
the worst experience
I've ever had in my whole life.

58:44.021 --> 58:46.774
Sometimes death
doesn't give you a warning.

58:46.775 --> 58:47.990
It doesn't say,

58:48.817 --> 58:50.285
"Treat this night,

58:51.111 --> 58:52.653
and savor it,

58:52.654 --> 58:54.869
because it will be the last
night."

58:54.870 --> 58:56.866
So, I play like there's no
tomorrow.

58:56.867 --> 58:59.461
I treat it like,
"This is special."

59:00.328 --> 59:01.328
Because...

59:02.414 --> 59:03.791
There might not be a tomorrow.

59:03.792 --> 59:05.791
This is it.
This might be it.

59:05.792 --> 59:11.088
Out of every tragedy there should be
something positive gained from it.

59:11.089 --> 59:12.889
And that's one thing
that I've gained from it.

59:14.718 --> 59:16.140
Living like
there's no tomorrow.

59:23.435 --> 59:26.776
[man] Has a replacement for
Randy been determined yet?

59:26.777 --> 59:29.491
No, a replacement
hasn't been determined yet,

59:29.492 --> 59:31.817
but a decision will be made,

59:31.818 --> 59:34.236
in the course of the next few
days.

59:34.237 --> 59:37.332
To be honest with you we really
didn't have much time to...

59:37.991 --> 59:39.658
to mourn.

59:39.659 --> 59:41.787
A decision was made
to continue,

59:43.455 --> 59:46.665
to keep Ozzy busy... occupied.

59:46.666 --> 59:48.542
If Ozzy would have just gone
home,

59:48.543 --> 59:51.378
and canceled the tour,

59:51.379 --> 59:53.302
he would have probably
drank himself to death.

59:54.424 --> 59:58.928
So, basically, we had
about ten days

59:58.929 --> 01:00:01.933
to find a guitar player that
could actually play the songs

01:00:01.934 --> 01:00:04.397
the way that Randy composed
them and recorded.

01:00:04.398 --> 01:00:06.565
And fortunately that's
when Brad Gillis,

01:00:06.566 --> 01:00:09.480
came into the picture.

01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:13.529
[Brad] It was like the biggest gig in the
world that you could have at that time.

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:15.325
Because Ozzy was on top
of the world,

01:00:15.326 --> 01:00:16.403
with, you know,

01:00:16.404 --> 01:00:18.450
coming out with his
solo stuff...

01:00:18.451 --> 01:00:19.916
And I got the call
and I thought,

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:22.827
"I gotta do this."

01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:25.581
And the first night I stood at the
sound boards singing The Castle,

01:00:25.582 --> 01:00:27.706
and the big huge stage.

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:29.667
The pyro and the lighting,

01:00:29.668 --> 01:00:31.335
and the sound.

01:00:31.336 --> 01:00:33.462
I was at the soundboard going,

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:37.049
"Oh, my gosh. This is huge!"

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.135
I've never even played
with the band,

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:40.137
hardly even met the guys,

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:44.390
And here I'm playing
my first show.

01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:46.392
So, I didn't know
what to wear.

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:49.021
They gave me a... They got a
Ferrari jumpsuit they let me wear.

01:00:49.022 --> 01:00:51.739
It was kinda cool.
Wore that for the first show.

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.649
And they put make-up on me,

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:56.115
you know, I never really
did make-up before,

01:00:56.116 --> 01:00:57.738
and that was kinda strange.

01:00:57.739 --> 01:00:59.947
And I tell you, for anybody,

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:02.119
that would have
been a tough gig.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.211
But, you know,
I was a hired gun,

01:01:04.212 --> 01:01:05.911
and been put on the spot,

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:07.457
and thrown into the fire.

01:01:07.458 --> 01:01:09.206
It was either shit or get off
the pot.

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:11.672
You know, I thought if I didn't
follow through with this,

01:01:11.673 --> 01:01:14.137
I'll kick myself in the ass
the rest of my life.

01:01:14.138 --> 01:01:17.631
One big issue that we
were confronting at the time,

01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:21.223
was that Randy's style of playing
was so new, so cutting edge,

01:01:21.224 --> 01:01:24.564
that very few musicians
could actually play like that.

01:01:24.565 --> 01:01:27.349
And Brad did a fantastic job.

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:30.650
There was so much pressure.
He had so much pressure on him.

01:01:30.651 --> 01:01:32.813
And he was incredibly graceful.

01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:34.481
Talking to the rest of the band

01:01:34.482 --> 01:01:36.859
they said, "Hey, man, you can
branch out and do your own thing.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.069
Just stick to the major solos,

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:41.614
and keep them as best as you
can."

01:01:41.615 --> 01:01:44.575
So, you know, I did that.

01:01:44.576 --> 01:01:46.452
I tried my best to learn
note for note.

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:47.995
But, with four days,

01:01:47.996 --> 01:01:50.206
and 19 songs,

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:51.796
and I was learning on the spot.

01:01:51.797 --> 01:01:54.543
I was... Everyday
I'd practice on the road

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.545
even after I started gigging
with Ozzy.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.467
But from the start
it was tough for me.

01:01:58.468 --> 01:02:00.341
It was tough for everybody
seeing me.

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:01.592
And I knew that.

01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:04.517
And I just had to do
what I was there to do,

01:02:04.518 --> 01:02:06.555
and to do the best I could,

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:10.100
and to get them
through this tour.

01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:14.813
I remember performing
at Madison Square garden,

01:02:14.814 --> 01:02:17.691
packed house,
and it was like a wake

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:19.109
for Randy Rhoads.

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:22.029
Every banner, every sign,

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:25.574
was about how much people
loved Randy.

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:28.998
You know, a lot of kids in the audience,
man, they were flipping me off,

01:02:28.999 --> 01:02:31.210
and "Randy Rhoads
lives forever" signs,

01:02:31.211 --> 01:02:32.799
and guys with their arms
crossed.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:35.000
I had to expect that. I'm...

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:37.341
filling in for the late great
Randy Rhoads,

01:02:37.342 --> 01:02:40.005
and I'm just trying
to help this tour move along.

01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:41.428
After a couple of days
I went to Rudy,

01:02:41.429 --> 01:02:43.676
I said, "I don't know
if I could do this anymore.

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:45.391
It's tough that
people don't like me."

01:02:45.392 --> 01:02:47.731
And he goes, "Man, they'll
start to respect you, man.

01:02:47.732 --> 01:02:49.895
You just... just keep moving."

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:52.393
Brad Gillis...

01:02:52.394 --> 01:02:55.354
We have to give him respect
no matter what.

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:58.691
He and I have a lot
of common thread.

01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:01.318
We had that thing,
like a beloved...

01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:03.112
instrumentalist,

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:05.473
that reinvented their instrument,
Randy Rhoads/Cliff Burton.

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:10.378
We had to step into those shoes
that could not be filled.

01:03:10.379 --> 01:03:13.038
Not everybody is made for that.

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:14.882
Metallica was already
established

01:03:14.883 --> 01:03:18.544
as a giant touring band
by when I joined them.

01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:22.550
So, you go into these countries where
they got to see Cliff dominate, right?

01:03:22.551 --> 01:03:25.018
So, who is this guy
standing in Cliff's place now?

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:28.554
Some places I got tortured,

01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:30.649
for the first couple of times
we went there.

01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:33.475
But because I stood my ground,

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.810
and took it to em',

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:37.026
and didn't let them
get to me like I didn't.

01:03:37.027 --> 01:03:39.318
You don't react back
cause then they win.

01:03:39.319 --> 01:03:41.988
The only way you react is by
hanging in there and being better

01:03:41.989 --> 01:03:44.238
and singing stronger
and that kind of thing.

01:03:44.239 --> 01:03:47.656
So, I went through
that kind of trial by fire,

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.079
for a couple of years,

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.243
besides doing the band,

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:52.370
trial by fire.

01:03:54.122 --> 01:03:56.332
Going on stage
after Randy died,

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:59.052
it was just a matter
of surviving each show,

01:03:59.053 --> 01:04:01.545
emotionally.

01:04:01.546 --> 01:04:05.471
I watch myself perform, and I'm going,
"I'm not connecting with anybody here."

01:04:05.472 --> 01:04:07.807
I'm not even looking
at... around.

01:04:07.808 --> 01:04:11.181
I'm not even looking at the audience.
I'm just going through the motions.

01:04:12.557 --> 01:04:15.309
That's not the reason
why I started playing.

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:16.899
I didn't want to be a robot.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:20.490
I didn't want to be disconnected
with music, with my soul.

01:04:23.735 --> 01:04:25.112
So, I had to move on.

01:04:25.113 --> 01:04:26.820
I had to move on.

01:04:26.821 --> 01:04:29.370
It was the toughest decision
I've ever made in my whole life,

01:04:29.371 --> 01:04:32.493
to go from, like, people
that I love,

01:04:32.494 --> 01:04:34.703
because Sharon
and Ozzy, they...

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:36.456
took incredible care of me.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.542
They were gracious, you know.

01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:44.423
But, I had to get joy back
in my playing again.

01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:46.595
I really did.

01:04:55.350 --> 01:05:00.521
After having lost a certain gig where
it was all shut down without warning,

01:05:00.522 --> 01:05:03.569
and then there's that sort of
gap where you're scrambling,

01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:05.694
like a fish out of water
trying...

01:05:05.695 --> 01:05:07.195
to get back into something,

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:11.448
just so you can pay your bills.

01:05:11.449 --> 01:05:14.790
I get a call from one of the
guys that I used to play with

01:05:14.791 --> 01:05:16.250
in Mandy Moore's band,

01:05:16.251 --> 01:05:18.248
and he says, "I'm now
the musical director

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:20.758
for Lizzy McGuire,

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:22.751
a Disney artist."

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:24.378
I'm like,

01:05:24.379 --> 01:05:26.632
"Who? I don't even
know who that is.

01:05:26.633 --> 01:05:28.048
Tell me more."

01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:31.552
So I find out later that
Lizzy McGuire is Hillary Duff.

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:33.643
And, "They're trying
to mold her into a singer,

01:05:33.644 --> 01:05:36.310
and they kind of want
to make her edgy.

01:05:36.311 --> 01:05:37.978
They want a rock guitar player.

01:05:37.979 --> 01:05:40.022
I thought of you.
What are you doing?"

01:05:40.023 --> 01:05:43.819
I had just come from two years on
the road playing with Vince Neil,

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:46.150
where it was drunk, rowdy,

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.949
you know... Big theaters, bars,

01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:49.736
tits.

01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:51.864
Girls French kissing
in the front row.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:55.117
All kinds of Rock n Roll stuff.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:58.203
And then, now I'm touring
stadiums packed,

01:05:58.204 --> 01:06:00.000
but it's, like, little kids.

01:06:00.001 --> 01:06:03.593
Some... In most cases it was their
first time ever at a concert.

01:06:03.594 --> 01:06:06.420
The line backstage for me
became,

01:06:06.421 --> 01:06:09.673
"Okay, guys, time
to scare the kids."

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:11.927
You know, I'll get the, "Ahhh,
who's this guy?"

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:16.185
It was funny because I took
my daughter

01:06:16.186 --> 01:06:20.982
down to a venue in Phoenix, Arizona,
where we live to go see Hilary Duff.

01:06:20.983 --> 01:06:24.688
And stage, left, is this,
like, really cool looking,

01:06:24.689 --> 01:06:26.908
Rock n Roll, like,
heavy metal guitar player.

01:06:26.909 --> 01:06:29.693
He's got on black jeans,

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:32.948
like Doc Martin, he's got a
chain hanging down, I mean...

01:06:32.949 --> 01:06:37.201
He looked like he should have been
playing in Metallica or something.

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:41.044
When I saw Hilary Duff's show, and
I said, "Who's the guitar player?"

01:06:41.045 --> 01:06:43.003
And somebody finally said,
"That's Jason Hook."

01:06:43.004 --> 01:06:45.042
And I said, "Yeah,
write that name down."

01:06:45.043 --> 01:06:46.420
Cause when I go
to see other bands

01:06:46.421 --> 01:06:50.756
I always kinda make a note
of who people are.

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:53.351
[Hook] The second year
that I was in that gig,

01:06:53.352 --> 01:06:57.304
the craze for Hilary went off
the charts.

01:06:57.305 --> 01:07:00.057
She was so successful
that the band was on retainer

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:03.062
which is something
that doesn't happen very often.

01:07:03.063 --> 01:07:05.812
And essentially what
that means is that,

01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:08.157
they pay you whether
you're touring or not.

01:07:08.158 --> 01:07:11.109
I did something
sort of foolish.

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.329
I said, "I'm gonna
be an adult now.

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:15.822
I'm gonna buy a house."

01:07:15.823 --> 01:07:18.325
It wasn't long after that
where I was stunned

01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:20.747
because you literally
get out of bed one day

01:07:20.748 --> 01:07:23.339
and you open the e-mail
that says, "Hey, all.

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:25.165
After several meetings,

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:28.001
with the label and the movie
department,

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:32.172
we've decided to take Hilary's
career in a new direction,

01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:35.133
and we're gonna shut down
touring.

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:38.557
Thank you very much for all
your support and loyalty.

01:07:38.558 --> 01:07:42.105
And we wish all of you the best
of luck for your future."

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:44.064
The end.

01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:46.066
I'm like...

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:50.696
Sheer terror.

01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:01.038
It's one thing being
Billy Joel's drummer,

01:08:01.039 --> 01:08:04.460
but it's another thing being the
wife of Billy Joel's drummer.

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:09.213
I was getting divorced
from my second wife.

01:08:09.214 --> 01:08:12.259
I ended up telling her to take
everything and just leave me alone.

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:15.799
So, I went to Billy and I said,

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:18.178
"You know, if any
scraps fall on the floor

01:08:18.179 --> 01:08:19.678
maybe you could sweep
them my way."

01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:22.475
And he just looked at me
and said, "I can't do that."

01:08:22.477 --> 01:08:24.975
"I wished you'd never asked me
that. I can't do that."

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:28.442
lrrelative of my success
is complicating things because

01:08:28.443 --> 01:08:31.237
everybody wants more money,
more money, more more...

01:08:34.193 --> 01:08:36.069
And I continued on the tour
doing the tour,

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:38.163
but we didn't...
Never spoke after that.

01:08:38.165 --> 01:08:39.990
The tour ends.

01:08:39.991 --> 01:08:42.743
And the next thing I know is
Billy's getting married again,

01:08:43.411 --> 01:08:44.786
to his third wife.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.584
So, I call up the keyboard
player and I said...

01:08:47.585 --> 01:08:49.457
"I guess we're not invited
to the wedding?"

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:51.256
And he says, "I got my
invitation."

01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:57.466
<i>You're never fired.</i>

01:08:57.466 --> 01:09:00.676
You're just not asked
to do the next thing.

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:03.807
I knew it was over when
he played Madison Square garden

01:09:03.808 --> 01:09:08.477
and I was getting calls from people
that wanted to get tickets to go.

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:11.193
Or, or... "Hey, I heard
you're playing in my town?"

01:09:11.194 --> 01:09:13.442
"Billy's coming to town.
You're with him, right?"

01:09:13.443 --> 01:09:15.651
"No, I'm not"

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:18.121
You know when,
it's like saying it is like,

01:09:18.122 --> 01:09:21.531
it could happen,
but once you say it, it's like,

01:09:21.532 --> 01:09:23.830
"Fuck, yeah, I'm not
that guy anymore."

01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:32.714
So, the divorce and that
happened at the same time.

01:09:32.715 --> 01:09:35.337
So, my wife buried me in sand
up to my neck,

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.340
and then Billy kicked
me in the face.

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:48.459
[man] What do you think now that
you are a Rock n Roll star?

01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:52.818
I don't think too
much about it.

01:09:52.819 --> 01:09:53.939
Because if I did,

01:09:55.108 --> 01:09:57.110
I'd probably get a real swell
head.

01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:02.617
[Liberty] The question
is, when did it go from,

01:10:02.618 --> 01:10:05.459
"Love me, love my band," to "Get
the fuck out of my dressing room!"

01:10:10.665 --> 01:10:12.290
We played in Fargo.

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:14.464
It was Easter Sunday
the next clay,

01:10:15.336 --> 01:10:18.296
and Billy had a private plane.

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:21.383
And I wanted to get
on the plane.

01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:24.558
And I was told, "No, there's
not enough room for you."

01:10:24.559 --> 01:10:26.763
"What... What do you mean?

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:30.189
I know there's so many seats on the plane
and there's only so many people going?"

01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:31.852
"No, not enough room.

01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:33.230
Billy might want to lay down."

01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:36.157
[laughs]

01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:38.483
"What?"

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:40.569
"Billy might wanna lay down.

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:42.493
So, you can't go home
for Easter."

01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:48.372
I thought I was part
of something,

01:10:48.373 --> 01:10:51.839
that was going to write
"payoff" at the end, but, uh...

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.834
Fuck, I guess it's never going
to happen!

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:58.926
I told him. I said, "I understand
why you're doing what you're doing.

01:10:58.927 --> 01:11:01.515
You are Billy Joel. Your
name is on the album cover.

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:04.473
But, if you ever need my help,

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.937
I'm there for you."

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.944
[Chris] When you're touring,

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:25.039
and you're getting all those checks
and they're just stacking up,

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.782
you're like, "Ah, I'm good!"

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:28.410
But when the tour is over
it's over.

01:11:28.411 --> 01:11:30.662
The money you have
left in your account you need,

01:11:30.663 --> 01:11:32.788
and all of a sudden
it's like, "Whoa,

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:36.374
like, I have less than a $1000
in my account now.

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:40.253
And I don't know when
my next gig is coming up."

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:42.300
You know, you're living
the life, you're on tour,

01:11:42.301 --> 01:11:43.762
everything is really great,

01:11:43.763 --> 01:11:46.136
that check is deposited
in your account every Friday.

01:11:46.137 --> 01:11:47.352
And then it stops.

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:49.304
And you're like,

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.306
"Hmmm,

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:55.312
maybe I got a little cushion, but I
still gotta provide for my family."

01:11:55.313 --> 01:11:58.063
[Paul] Throughout the
journey of being a player,

01:11:58.064 --> 01:11:59.314
sure,

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:01.780
there have been lean moments
along the way.

01:12:01.781 --> 01:12:03.778
And you know that moment
where you go to the ATM

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:06.197
and you realize,

01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:11.952
"Wow, somebody around here
has go to get a job."

01:12:11.953 --> 01:12:15.044
Th funniest thing is my friends
from high school think I'm rich.

01:12:15.045 --> 01:12:16.164
"Are you kidding me?"

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:17.791
I go on the road,

01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:19.459
I come back,

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.428
I have to get a job. My buddy
and I are painting houses.

01:12:21.429 --> 01:12:22.842
I remember painting this house,

01:12:22.843 --> 01:12:24.714
and I'm taking a break.

01:12:24.715 --> 01:12:26.308
I'm sitting on a bucket
eating a sandwich,

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:27.768
I look up and Matt Sorum
walks in.

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:31.137
I'm like, "Holy shit!
Matt Sorum."

01:12:31.138 --> 01:12:33.765
He's like, "Hey, man." And then
he's like, "Looks good, looks good.

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:35.856
And he looks down
on me, he was like,

01:12:35.857 --> 01:12:37.479
"I know you from somewhere."

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.399
I was like, "Yeah,
we met at Hamburg.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:40.899
We were on tour
with Soundgarden."

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:43.024
He's like, "Shit, that's right.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.025
How you been?"

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:45.277
I'm like,

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:47.121
"Well, I'm painting
your fuckin house, man."

01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:55.379
[Hook] The only reason why I sorta fell
into hired gun type work is because,

01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:58.623
I was failing, you know,
to get to the dream.

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:01.503
The A dream I kinda call it...
The A dream for me,

01:13:01.504 --> 01:13:04.462
was to be in a band
with four, five guys

01:13:04.463 --> 01:13:06.885
writing original music
and everyone loved it,

01:13:06.886 --> 01:13:08.967
and everyone wanted
to buy a ticket to the concert.

01:13:08.968 --> 01:13:09.935
That's the A dream.

01:13:09.936 --> 01:13:11.678
So, the B dream
to me was, like,

01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:14.394
"Well, nobody... All the bands
that I'm putting together

01:13:14.395 --> 01:13:15.891
nobody gives a shit about.

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:18.852
So, I'll just look after
myself,"

01:13:18.853 --> 01:13:21.396
and go rent myself to somebody,

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:23.481
because I know that I can
deliver.

01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:26.201
You know, if somebody would have told me
Hilary Duff's guitar player was coming

01:13:26.202 --> 01:13:29.863
and I go, "Yeah?" And he's
going out the back door...

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:32.786
But, I also knew about
Jason Hook's playing.

01:13:32.787 --> 01:13:34.284
I didn't have to audition him.

01:13:34.285 --> 01:13:35.958
I already knew he was going
to be fine.

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:39.711
[crowd cheering]

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.477
♪ Well, we got no choice ♪

01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:03.482
[Ezrin] Alice has always
had a fantastic band.

01:14:03.483 --> 01:14:05.324
And even when I wasn't
working with him,

01:14:05.325 --> 01:14:10.070
he had... Davey Johnstone
who's with Elton john,

01:14:10.071 --> 01:14:13.406
Kip Winger who's just
a fantastic musician,

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:16.952
and Eric Singer,
lots of great drummers...

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:21.254
and yeah, he's always attracted the
best of the best of the sidemen.

01:14:21.255 --> 01:14:25.126
Always surround yourself
with A-list players.

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:28.505
I mean, everybody in my band's
an A-list player.

01:14:28.506 --> 01:14:30.929
It's that... I just don't have
time for B-list guys.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:45.981
[Nita] I got a phone call from a
national number that I didn't know.

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:47.825
And he said,
"This is Kip Winger."

01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:52.739
And he goes, "Are you
available this summer?"

01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:55.573
And I said, "I would have got some gigs.
Why, what's going on?"

01:14:55.574 --> 01:14:57.450
And he goes, "Well,
I hope you can cancel them

01:14:57.451 --> 01:15:00.330
because I just got you an audition
to play guitar for Alice Cooper."

01:15:00.331 --> 01:15:03.707
I went back at the phone, I said,
"Ah, my schedule just cleared up."

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:06.674
[man] I just had a feeling about
her and she was so eager.

01:15:06.675 --> 01:15:09.716
And she was so pumped
about doing this, you know.

01:15:09.717 --> 01:15:11.591
She wood shedded, she had
studied...

01:15:11.592 --> 01:15:13.763
She came in and, well,
she was perfect.

01:15:13.764 --> 01:15:16.928
Now Nita will be in that
A-list carrel now.

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:18.680
All the guys now will look,

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.270
and they've heard her now
and they go,

01:15:20.271 --> 01:15:22.981
"Okay, she's a proven...
She's a proven thing now."

01:15:22.982 --> 01:15:24.397
[Hook]
It says a lot about you,

01:15:24.398 --> 01:15:26.944
if you've been selected
to be in Alice's band.

01:15:26.945 --> 01:15:28.690
I know this because I was.

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:32.235
And I saw the other guys
around me that were.

01:15:32.236 --> 01:15:34.614
It says a lot about you
and your ability,

01:15:34.615 --> 01:15:36.784
because those shows
were exhausting.

01:15:36.785 --> 01:15:38.246
There is no backing vocals,

01:15:38.247 --> 01:15:40.789
there is no click track,
like, we do everything, live.

01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:44.289
[Alice] When it comes to the stage
show I let them have their movement.

01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:46.461
When I back up, they move
forward.

01:15:46.462 --> 01:15:49.713
When you're playing the lead
you are now Alice Cooper.

01:15:49.714 --> 01:15:51.004
So you take over.

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:52.302
Guitar players,

01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:54.215
are show offs.

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:56.556
Anybody that says they're not
is lying.

01:15:56.557 --> 01:15:58.636
We all want to show off all
the time

01:15:58.637 --> 01:16:01.186
and if we could just stand in the middle
and just do tricks the whole time

01:16:01.187 --> 01:16:02.978
we would. At least I would.

01:16:02.979 --> 01:16:05.146
So, you know, and you learn
as a guitar player

01:16:05.147 --> 01:16:07.145
till you show some restraint
on stage

01:16:07.146 --> 01:16:10.612
and let the singer do their thing,
and especially as a hired musician.

01:16:10.613 --> 01:16:13.780
I've shown an unbelievable
amount of restraint sometimes.

01:16:13.781 --> 01:16:15.371
Alice let you be yourself.

01:16:15.372 --> 01:16:17.197
If you were flashy,

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:19.166
and wanted to be flamboyant,
a real performer,

01:16:19.167 --> 01:16:20.250
he didn't care.

01:16:26.207 --> 01:16:27.707
I played with Alice,

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:30.085
all the way through
up until 2008.

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:33.215
And Alice would be cool enough
to let me get a replacement

01:16:33.216 --> 01:16:34.841
to come in for him
for a week or two

01:16:34.842 --> 01:16:36.554
while I would go
and play with Kiss.

01:16:36.555 --> 01:16:39.302
[Alice] Kiss and Alice never
toured at the same time.

01:16:39.303 --> 01:16:41.099
We were sharing the same
drummer.

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:43.850
So Kiss would go out
for four or five months,

01:16:43.851 --> 01:16:46.564
and then my tour would start
right when the Kiss tour ended.

01:16:46.565 --> 01:16:47.936
Eric never got a break.

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:49.896
There's no better compliment

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:51.564
than to be in demand

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:54.489
by two of the most legendary,

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:56.903
bands, ever!

01:16:56.904 --> 01:16:59.697
I think finally Eric
just said, "I...

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:01.908
I can't do this anymore."

01:17:01.909 --> 01:17:04.082
And I just said,
"Go with Kiss."

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:17.924
When I was a kid I always said
I wanna be in a band like...

01:17:17.925 --> 01:17:18.892
like a Kiss.

01:17:18.893 --> 01:17:20.223
I want
to be in an Alice Cooper.

01:17:20.224 --> 01:17:21.683
I didn't know
I'd end up in Kiss.

01:17:21.684 --> 01:17:23.932
You tell that son of a bitch
when he was 18,

01:17:23.933 --> 01:17:25.895
"You're one day
you're gonna be in Kiss."

01:17:25.896 --> 01:17:27.856
He'd be, like,
"Get outta here."

01:17:27.857 --> 01:17:30.901
[John 5] I always looked up to him
ever since I saw him in Badlands.

01:17:30.902 --> 01:17:33.356
Now he's in Kiss.

01:17:33.357 --> 01:17:34.904
It's like, incredible.

01:17:36.944 --> 01:17:40.073
I don't ever try to play
like somebody, per Se,

01:17:40.074 --> 01:17:41.411
but you want
to at least be...

01:17:41.412 --> 01:17:43.747
Be reasonably respectful
to the part.

01:17:43.748 --> 01:17:45.618
People think just
because I wear,

01:17:45.619 --> 01:17:49.542
make up that was associated with
Peter Criss as the original drummer,

01:17:49.543 --> 01:17:51.668
all of a sudden they think,
automatically, that I'm

01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:54.090
trying to act like him and play
like him. It's, like, "No.

01:17:54.091 --> 01:17:56.004
Gene and Paul never said,

01:17:56.005 --> 01:17:59.052
Oh, Eric, we want you to watch videos.
We need you to play more like Peter.

01:17:59.053 --> 01:18:00.266
You need to do some..."

01:18:00.267 --> 01:18:01.467
Never once!

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:03.061
It's so ridiculous that people
say that.

01:18:03.062 --> 01:18:05.268
I don't play like him at all,
actually.

01:18:05.269 --> 01:18:07.015
The only thing that
I do in common

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:09.309
is I wear that cat make-up.

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:10.649
That's where it stops.

01:18:10.650 --> 01:18:12.565
And the irony of the whole
thing is that,

01:18:12.566 --> 01:18:14.772
Peter and Ace didn't care
about the make-up.

01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:17.025
They sold the rights to Gene and Paul
because they thought it was worth nothing.

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:18.994
Hey, who wants to sit out there
and play in clubs

01:18:18.995 --> 01:18:20.695
and struggling their
whole life? I don't.

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:22.869
All I ever wanted to do was play
in a big band since I was a kid.

01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:24.242
That's what I dreamed of doing.

01:18:24.243 --> 01:18:26.117
And that's what I've ended up
doing,

01:18:26.118 --> 01:18:28.539
and I'm very proud and happy about
all the things I've gotten to do.

01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:29.540
I think it's cool.

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:36.012
The Alice Cooper Five finger
death punch transition,

01:18:36.013 --> 01:18:40.506
it really all comes down to my
relationship with Jeremy Spencer.

01:18:40.507 --> 01:18:43.181
I was out there touring
with Alice Cooper,

01:18:43.182 --> 01:18:46.095
and he was in LA
playing the clubs.

01:18:46.096 --> 01:18:50.438
And they were starting to pick up
heat and momentum quite quickly.

01:18:50.439 --> 01:18:53.061
And when I would
come off the road with Cooper,

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:55.772
I would go see them
play in the clubs.

01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:58.691
And I remember sitting there
watching them play, going,

01:18:58.692 --> 01:19:00.132
"I don't want
to be left out of this.

01:19:00.611 --> 01:19:02.237
This sucks."

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:05.242
Jason, you know,
he was supportive from day one.

01:19:05.243 --> 01:19:07.662
He was at our showcase
that we got signed,

01:19:07.663 --> 01:19:09.624
and he was at our first gig we
played.

01:19:09.625 --> 01:19:13.043
And we were starting to have
problems with our guitar player.

01:19:13.044 --> 01:19:15.336
So, I'm like, "Hey, man,
there may be

01:19:15.337 --> 01:19:17.505
an opportunity for me
to get you in this thing

01:19:17.506 --> 01:19:19.295
if you're serious about it."

01:19:19.296 --> 01:19:21.469
[Hook] And he was like, "Well,
I just wanted to let you know.

01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:25.260
We can't afford to pay you
Alice Cooper salary."

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:27.104
And I was like, "I don't care
about that.

01:19:27.105 --> 01:19:28.429
Money will come.

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.890
Money can be earned in other
ways.

01:19:30.891 --> 01:19:33.810
It's not about...
It's about grabbing,

01:19:33.811 --> 01:19:35.853
the right wave.

01:19:35.854 --> 01:19:37.443
The one that you believe in,

01:19:37.444 --> 01:19:39.988
and have a great time
riding it to the shore."

01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:43.695
Everybody was, like,

01:19:43.696 --> 01:19:45.786
"You really understand
what you're saying, right?"

01:19:45.787 --> 01:19:47.909
Like, "Do you really
wanna go do that?

01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:52.207
Do you really wanna travel around in a van
and eat bologna, and play heavy metal?"

01:19:52.208 --> 01:19:54.582
I was like, "Yes, I do.
Absolutely, one hundred percent."

01:19:54.583 --> 01:19:57.709
Because I knew their potential.

01:19:57.710 --> 01:20:00.054
I had arranged
to speak with Alice.

01:20:00.055 --> 01:20:01.629
And he was so cool,

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:04.470
he was just, like, "You know,
I always encourage my guys

01:20:04.471 --> 01:20:05.842
to swing the bat, man,

01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:06.968
go out there,

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:08.182
take your best shot."

01:20:08.183 --> 01:20:09.929
All these guys leave
with my blessing.

01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:12.390
"Go, and be a big star."

01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:15.143
Jason took that step and now
he goes,

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:19.024
and jumps into a band that's
just on the cusp of making it.

01:20:19.025 --> 01:20:21.607
And he puts that final...

01:20:21.608 --> 01:20:23.531
That final touch that
makes it happen.

01:20:48.719 --> 01:20:50.640
So Jason had joined
Five finger, I'm thinking,

01:20:50.641 --> 01:20:53.434
"Okay, you're joining on the trajectory
on the way up, so there's...

01:20:53.435 --> 01:20:56.100
You're taking a shot that this
thing is gonna win big."

01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:57.569
And I tell you, you gotta
hand it to him, man,

01:20:57.570 --> 01:21:00.813
because he signed in
at the exact right time.

01:21:00.814 --> 01:21:03.738
[Spencer] A lot of the core ideas
of some of our radio hits,

01:21:03.739 --> 01:21:05.526
have been from Jason...

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:07.323
and you know,
I'm really grateful that he's

01:21:07.324 --> 01:21:08.664
has the ability to do that.

01:21:08.665 --> 01:21:09.947
Six years later,

01:21:09.948 --> 01:21:11.699
you have seven gold records,

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.368
one platinum single,

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:15.119
five number one songs,

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.839
and we're embarking on the
biggest tour we've ever done

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:20.208
headlining arenas.

01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:22.132
[Kael] Death Punch is one
of the last few

01:21:22.133 --> 01:21:24.087
hard rock metal bands

01:21:24.088 --> 01:21:27.217
that is actually able to make the
amount of money that we're able to make

01:21:27.218 --> 01:21:29.175
and have the huge
audiences that we have.

01:21:29.176 --> 01:21:30.802
I mean, people are still
buying our records.

01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:34.138
In a time when nobody's
buying records

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:35.765
we're still going gold,

01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:37.934
as a hard rock heavy metal act

01:21:37.935 --> 01:21:41.479
with songs called
Burn Motherfucker.

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:44.199
Five hundred thousand copies
of Burn Motherfucker?

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.608
Very, very fortunate.

01:21:45.609 --> 01:21:46.818
[Hook] It's like,

01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:49.904
your whole life you
are writing songs

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:52.829
trying to perfect the craft
of making music,

01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:54.867
try to develop your skill.

01:21:54.868 --> 01:21:58.454
And when you finally get
a chance to do it for real,

01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:00.331
and people respond to it,

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:02.676
to the point where they're willing
to show up at an airport for,

01:22:02.677 --> 01:22:05.215
and wait for eight hours
for your plane to arrive

01:22:05.216 --> 01:22:07.180
just so they can
see you in person.

01:22:08.715 --> 01:22:09.966
That's...

01:22:09.967 --> 01:22:11.059
You can't pay for that.

01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:21.771
For years I've been like, "I don't
wanna be a side guy anymore."

01:22:21.772 --> 01:22:24.068
And even if my band remains
underground

01:22:24.069 --> 01:22:25.690
I'm cool with that.

01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:27.864
I can do sessions
playing on cool records,

01:22:27.865 --> 01:22:29.360
meet cool people,

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:30.613
and do my own band.

01:22:30.614 --> 01:22:31.955
But, how the fuck,

01:22:32.823 --> 01:22:34.416
do you say no to Bon Jovi?

01:22:48.755 --> 01:22:50.590
I love making music.

01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:53.640
And if somebody calls
me up and says,

01:22:54.845 --> 01:22:56.596
"I have $200

01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:59.066
and I really, really
would love you to do,

01:23:00.309 --> 01:23:01.729
guitars on this track."

01:23:01.730 --> 01:23:03.066
And I'm, like, "Send it to me."

01:23:03.067 --> 01:23:05.062
And they send me the song,
and the song's good

01:23:05.063 --> 01:23:06.610
and the person
was really sweet,

01:23:06.611 --> 01:23:08.149
I'll do it for nothin.

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:10.196
But if somebody sends me,
"I have $300,

01:23:10.197 --> 01:23:13.198
and I want you to play on this. I know
you'll take it to the next level"

01:23:13.199 --> 01:23:14.198
And I listen to it,

01:23:14.199 --> 01:23:15.541
and I can't stand the song,

01:23:15.542 --> 01:23:17.241
"I can't do it."

01:23:17.242 --> 01:23:20.286
I feel like I'm nickel
and diming my soul.

01:23:20.287 --> 01:23:22.914
Because, when you
pay me 300 bucks,

01:23:22.915 --> 01:23:26.042
you're not getting
Phil X for three hours.

01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:30.379
You're getting what
it took me my entire life,

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:33.966
to cultivate into these hands
in this heart.

01:23:33.967 --> 01:23:37.437
I can't play on a piece
of shit for $300.

01:23:38.388 --> 01:23:39.981

01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:03.975
[Rudy] I made the decision to go
from the biggest band in the world,

01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:06.058
Ozzy Osbourne,

01:25:06.059 --> 01:25:09.520
to the total
unknown Quiet Riot.

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:12.273
It wasn't even really
a leap of faith because,

01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:14.402
I mean, I have
faith in Quiet Riot,

01:25:14.403 --> 01:25:17.405
that we could sell
maybe 50,000 records a year

01:25:17.406 --> 01:25:19.623
and make a living, play, you
know...

01:25:19.624 --> 01:25:23.242
We didn't aspire
for anything bigger than that.

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:25.041
We just wanted
to make another record.

01:25:26.204 --> 01:25:29.999
So, we have Metal Health
finished.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.092
Ready to be released.

01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:33.762
And we couldn't find a manager.

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.673
We would say,
"Listen to this record."

01:25:37.674 --> 01:25:39.345
"Eh, I don't know,
that kind of music

01:25:39.346 --> 01:25:42.096
I don't think is really ever
gonna come back."

01:25:42.097 --> 01:25:46.724
So, our beginning with Quiet Riot
was very, very humble beginnings.

01:25:46.725 --> 01:25:49.604
We were driving ourselves
in a station wagon,

01:25:49.605 --> 01:25:52.647
playing up and down
the pacific coast.

01:25:52.648 --> 01:25:54.982
And by the time the tour ended,

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:57.780
we were in Denver
and the promoter Barry Faith,

01:25:57.781 --> 01:26:01.157
who was actually booking
the acts for the US festival,

01:26:01.158 --> 01:26:03.491
needed a band
for the metal day

01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:04.992
because somebody,

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:07.708
was out of the line-up
and they had a gap,

01:26:07.709 --> 01:26:10.081
so, it's like they
asked us to do it.

01:26:10.082 --> 01:26:12.710
So, we say, "Yeah,
we'd love to do it."

01:26:12.711 --> 01:26:14.837
So, we were the first
band to go on.

[Rudy] And, that was
incredible exposure for us.

01:26:46.913 --> 01:26:49.081
You know, just phenomenal.
Phenomenal!

01:26:49.082 --> 01:26:51.706
And by then the record
was double platinum.

01:26:51.707 --> 01:26:56.210
You know, we had Come On Feel The
Noise was in rotation on MTV

01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:58.464
every half hour.
I could set my watch.

01:26:58.465 --> 01:27:01.137
Because every half hour
Come On Feel The Noise came on

01:27:01.138 --> 01:27:03.634
on MTV, you know,
Music Television.

01:27:03.635 --> 01:27:04.635
Who knew?

01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:05.979
And by November,

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.014
we had a number one album.

01:27:09.015 --> 01:27:12.986
We're talking number one when
your competition is Thriller,

01:27:12.987 --> 01:27:15.312
Synchronicity by the Police,

01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:17.565
and all those those
incredible albums.

01:27:17.566 --> 01:27:20.109
So, to me it wasn't just about,

01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:21.487
having a number one album...

01:27:21.488 --> 01:27:23.284
It was about being in such

01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:26.198
great company.

01:27:26.199 --> 01:27:30.035
What's really interesting
about going to the top,

01:27:30.036 --> 01:27:32.329
with any group is that,

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:35.499
your landscape
is exactly the same,

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:38.595
because I've experienced that
with three bands.

01:27:38.596 --> 01:27:40.385
Going from the bottom,

01:27:41.006 --> 01:27:42.590
to the very top.

01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:44.592
I did it with Ozzy,

01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:47.688
I experienced that with Quiet Riot,
and then later on with Whitesnake.

01:27:47.689 --> 01:27:49.597
And then once you get there,

01:27:49.598 --> 01:27:52.433
the trick is to stay there.
[laughs]

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:53.976
To stay on the top,

01:27:53.977 --> 01:27:56.228
which is because there's
plenty of room at the bottom.

01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:57.697
There's only so much
room at the top.

01:27:57.698 --> 01:27:59.985
There's only gonna be people
trying to push you,

01:27:59.986 --> 01:28:01.822
you know, shove you
off the the top.

01:28:01.823 --> 01:28:04.287
So, that is the toughest thing
to accomplish.

01:28:04.288 --> 01:28:06.197
Getting to the top is hard.

01:28:06.198 --> 01:28:08.576
Staying at the top
is virtually impossible.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.254
I wish I would have
the foresight,

01:28:12.255 --> 01:28:15.122
to predict any of the band's
successes,

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:17.087
or you would just have
to follow your heart.

01:28:17.088 --> 01:28:20.461
And after doing this for a while
I began to see the signs.

01:28:20.462 --> 01:28:22.508
You know, I began
to realize that,

01:28:22.509 --> 01:28:24.507
all of these
opportunities, to be...

01:28:24.508 --> 01:28:26.761
To be playing with some
of the greatest musicians,

01:28:27.511 --> 01:28:28.552
in the world,

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:29.804
actually are...

01:28:29.805 --> 01:28:31.557
It's a blessing to do that.

01:28:32.349 --> 01:28:34.141
The Ozzy Band.

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:37.567
I played with Quiet Riot and
achieved such incredible heights,

01:28:37.568 --> 01:28:39.355
you know, success.

01:28:39.356 --> 01:28:41.649
To go on stage with Whitesnake,

01:28:41.650 --> 01:28:43.776
a band that I'd been a fan of.

01:28:43.777 --> 01:28:45.277
My God!

01:28:45.278 --> 01:28:48.202
So, it took me a few years
to actually have the time,

01:28:48.203 --> 01:28:50.825
to look back and really relish,

01:28:50.826 --> 01:28:53.830
in all of the success
that I've been blessed with.

01:28:53.831 --> 01:28:56.747
And after all said and clone,

01:28:56.748 --> 01:29:00.093
the most important thing
that you have to remember,

01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:03.087
is the journey itself.

01:29:03.088 --> 01:29:04.797
That's when you say,

01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:06.549
"Oh, wow, check this out.

01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:08.092
I've accomplished this."

01:29:08.093 --> 01:29:09.470
But I've gotta tell you,

01:29:09.471 --> 01:29:10.928
it's the people,

01:29:10.929 --> 01:29:13.848
that I am on the journey
along with.

01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:15.683
That is priceless!

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:16.892
That really is.

01:29:16.893 --> 01:29:18.019
And that is...

01:29:18.937 --> 01:29:21.315
why I get out of bed everyday.

01:29:22.399 --> 01:29:24.441
Since I made God a promise

01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:28.571
that as long as my fingers were gonna
keep moving I was gonna keep playing.

01:29:28.572 --> 01:29:30.666
I can't go back on my
promise, you know.

01:29:30.667 --> 01:29:33.284
This is what I do.
Lam a musician.

01:29:33.285 --> 01:29:34.286
I must play.

01:29:38.999 --> 01:29:43.095
[man] I'd like to introduce
you to, Liberty DeVitto!

01:29:51.011 --> 01:29:52.261
How's it going?

01:29:52.262 --> 01:29:53.512
[all] Good!

01:29:53.513 --> 01:29:55.982
One of the last things
that was ever said to me

01:29:55.983 --> 01:29:58.517
while I was on the road
with Billy,

01:29:58.518 --> 01:30:00.477
came from the piano tuner.

01:30:00.478 --> 01:30:01.854
We were walking
down the street

01:30:01.855 --> 01:30:04.151
I remember coming
from breakfast or something.

01:30:04.152 --> 01:30:06.070
We weren't even talking,
just silent,

01:30:06.071 --> 01:30:07.613
He just turned to me
and he goes,

01:30:07.614 --> 01:30:09.325
"You know what your problem is?

01:30:09.326 --> 01:30:10.493
You're a nice guy."

01:30:18.788 --> 01:30:22.333
You're the drums.
The center of everything.

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:24.462
Like almost being
the center of the universe.

01:30:24.463 --> 01:30:28.803
We're the ones that make people get
up when they dance. It's our beat.

01:30:28.804 --> 01:30:33.429
So' Little Kids Rock puts instruments
and gives free lessons to kids,

01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:36.523
where their school program has
been taken out of the school

01:30:36.524 --> 01:30:39.975
in underprivileged schools,
like in Harlem...

01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:42.980
and you know, down and out
areas in different cities.

01:30:42.981 --> 01:30:45.481
Little Kids Rock has been
a saving grace for me.

01:30:45.482 --> 01:30:46.654
That was fun, right?

01:30:46.655 --> 01:30:47.858
[all] Yeah!

01:30:47.859 --> 01:30:49.735
Music is always fun.
It's a lot of fun.

01:30:49.736 --> 01:30:52.157
It's a great way to burn off
energy and stuff like that.

01:30:52.158 --> 01:30:56.205
And, you know whats great about it
is going from emotion to emotion.

01:30:56.206 --> 01:30:58.869
Like a fast song
to a slow song.

01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:00.412
Reflecting back,

01:31:00.413 --> 01:31:01.835
we made great records.

01:31:01.836 --> 01:31:02.957
We really did.

01:31:02.958 --> 01:31:05.552
I mean, those records
will last forever.

01:31:05.553 --> 01:31:08.128
People still get off
on that stuff.

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:10.844
Every time I'm driving in the
car and the station plays,

01:31:10.845 --> 01:31:14.306
Scenes from an Italian Restaurant,
like, "Yeah, that's me playing."

01:31:14.307 --> 01:31:17.181
You know, and when
I hear that stuff, people say,

01:31:17.182 --> 01:31:18.722
"Does it upset you?"

01:31:18.723 --> 01:31:21.520
And I say, "No, I just go
right back to the studio,

01:31:21.521 --> 01:31:24.567
and what it was like in the
studio making that record."

01:31:24.568 --> 01:31:26.522
We were like brothers.

01:31:26.523 --> 01:31:29.618
It was like going to war and we've
got very successful at what we did.

01:31:30.652 --> 01:31:33.195
If Billy is the father,

01:31:33.196 --> 01:31:34.743
the parent of those songs,

01:31:34.744 --> 01:31:37.074
I'm at least the uncle,
you know.

01:31:37.075 --> 01:31:39.749
But now if I saw Billy I'd hug
him and tell him I love him.

01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:42.705
If he called me up and said,

01:31:42.706 --> 01:31:44.879
"I'm sorry. Do you
want to play again?"

01:31:45.875 --> 01:31:47.418
I'd Say, "Yeah"

01:31:47.419 --> 01:31:50.587
Playing music gives
you an identity.

01:31:50.588 --> 01:31:53.799
It really, like,
"look what I can do!

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:56.140
It took me a long time
to learn how to do this.

01:31:56.141 --> 01:31:57.932
But look what I can do now."

01:31:57.933 --> 01:32:01.559
So, it's a great, great thing to
learn how to play an instrument.

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.058
And it's not too bad.

01:32:03.059 --> 01:32:05.312
I got my shot. My mother
used to tell me all the time,

01:32:05.313 --> 01:32:08.155
"Lib, you had your turn.
Now it's the young guys turns."

01:32:09.232 --> 01:32:10.946
But right now life is good.

01:32:10.947 --> 01:32:13.161
I play all the time,
great people.

01:32:13.162 --> 01:32:14.236
You know.

01:32:14.237 --> 01:32:15.363
It's cool.

01:32:34.632 --> 01:32:37.848
I want to see Bucket-head
get together with the other guy

01:32:37.849 --> 01:32:39.139
that's in the other band,

01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:41.265
and the other drummer
that's in that band,

01:32:41.266 --> 01:32:42.561
and put together a band,

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:44.646
of side guys.

01:32:45.852 --> 01:32:48.067
They're all great players,
why not?

01:32:48.068 --> 01:32:49.565
Why not put their own band
together?

01:32:50.648 --> 01:32:52.399
Nobody's done that yet.

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:54.071
Just call themselves
On The Side.

01:32:54.072 --> 01:32:55.537
Like French fries on the side.

01:32:55.538 --> 01:32:58.031
