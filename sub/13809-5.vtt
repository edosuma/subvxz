It's happening,

01:17.702 --> 01:22.207
Get this. They're opening up the
new ride at the amusement park.

01:22.290 --> 01:24.375
The human sky torpedo
is ready?

01:24.459 --> 01:26.169
Affirmative.

01:47.482 --> 01:48.441
I-I can't!

01:48.525 --> 01:50.944
I'm supposed to
babysit my cousin

01:51.027 --> 01:52.529
Little Scotty tomorrow.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.322
Not Scotty.

01:54.405 --> 01:56.866
{\an1}You promised that little geek
would never bug us again.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.868
It wasn't my idea!

01:58.952 --> 02:00.245
Tough luck, Twist.

02:00.328 --> 02:03.248
Yeah, while you're reading
kiddie books to the runt,

02:03.331 --> 02:06.417
{\an1}we'll be experiencing
the ultimate thrill ride.

02:09.002 --> 02:11.131
{\an1}You know
the deal, Maurice.

02:11.214 --> 02:13.758
{\an3}But he doesn't need
a babysitter. He's six!

02:13.842 --> 02:17.262
Just unplug everything, lock
all the doors and windows.

02:17.345 --> 02:18.096
He'll be fine!

02:18.179 --> 02:20.849
Come on,
I just want to get out

02:20.932 --> 02:22.058
for the afternoon!

Little Scotty is still
too young,<i> mi hijo.</i>

02:25.603 --> 02:28.565
{\an3}Now, if you had someone
more responsible help you...

02:28.648 --> 02:31.067
{\an1}Someone like Reggie.
She babysits you.

02:31.150 --> 02:33.611
She does not
babysit me!

02:33.695 --> 02:36.739
Mom, Dad, I'm totally
responsible!

02:36.823 --> 02:37.740
{\an1}Like you were
with your puppy?

02:37.824 --> 02:38.783

02:38.867 --> 02:41.286
I had a puppy?

02:44.664 --> 02:46.040
Well, look who's here

02:46.124 --> 02:48.835
{\an1}to say hi
to his favorite big cousin.

02:48.918 --> 02:49.669
It's little Scotty.

02:49.752 --> 02:52.338
Hi, Maurice.

02:52.422 --> 02:53.840
Hey, little Scotty.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.758
{\an1}Mother:
Isn't that nice?

02:55.842 --> 02:57.719
He loves you, Maurice.

02:57.802 --> 02:58.928
Cool...

02:59.012 --> 03:01.514
Yeah, cool.

03:03.266 --> 03:03.641
Oh, well, hey.

03:03.725 --> 03:04.642
That's Lars.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.603
You remember him?

03:06.686 --> 03:08.730
Hello.

03:08.813 --> 03:11.149
He's older than me
and even cooler.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.026
He's got neat stuff,

03:13.109 --> 03:15.570
and he knows
all kinds of stories.

03:15.653 --> 03:17.614
Hey, Lars,
want to babysit?

03:17.697 --> 03:18.573
( belches )

03:18.656 --> 03:20.617
He's a punk.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.577
I'd rather hang out
with you, Maurice.

03:22.660 --> 03:23.745
You're fun.

03:23.828 --> 03:25.455
Later, Munch.

Name any creature with four legs
that can do tricks and barks.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.687
A...seal?

03:49.771 --> 03:51.481
Doggy it is!

03:51.564 --> 03:53.149
Lame-O can make
whatever you want.

04:18.632 --> 04:20.677
{\an1}supposed to leave
the house.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.011
But this is follow-
the-leader, remember?

04:22.095 --> 04:24.013
Now, don't you
want to go somewhere

04:24.097 --> 04:26.432
that's really,
really cool?

04:26.516 --> 04:27.016
Yeah, where?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.519
Shh! It's a secret.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.562
Stay quiet and
don't ask questions.

04:31.646 --> 04:32.814
Okay.

{\an1}Hey, there, I bet you'd
just love a balloon animal.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.526
Neat!

06:00.610 --> 06:02.278
Yeah, right.

06:02.361 --> 06:04.447
{\an1}I was in
an amusement park once

06:04.530 --> 06:07.992
and they had a cool ride
called Bunnies Galore,

06:08.076 --> 06:09.285
where you got on a bunny

06:09.368 --> 06:11.329
and went to the see
the magic land where he lived.

06:11.412 --> 06:14.957
This place is
just like that,

06:15.041 --> 06:17.376
without the bunnies.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.586
( whirring )

06:21.881 --> 06:23.674
What's
happening, guys?

06:23.758 --> 06:24.217
Hey, Twist.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.928
Hey, Regina.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.721
( blows kiss )

06:28.805 --> 06:29.514
Aunt Sandy said

06:29.597 --> 06:32.475
you're Maurice's
babysitter.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.894
( Chuckling )
That's right.

06:34.977 --> 06:37.105
{\an1}Come here,
Wittle Twister.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.982
I don't have
a babysitter!

06:40.066 --> 06:42.777
( laughter )

06:42.860 --> 06:44.654
Look, watch the runt.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.989
Please, Reggie,
I'm begging you.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.617
I got to get a ticket
for this thing.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.371
Maurice is
pretty cool, huh?

06:53.454 --> 06:55.665
{\an1}Aw, you like him,
don't you?

06:55.748 --> 06:57.458
He's my favorite cousin.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.377
I don't have
any brothers or sisters,

06:59.460 --> 07:03.422
so a favorite cousin
is almost as good.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.550
Even if it
is Twister.

07:05.633 --> 07:06.634
His real name's
Maurice.

07:06.717 --> 07:10.847
I don't think he likes
being called Twister.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.307
{\an1}Yeah, he really likes
"Squid" better.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.853
Got my ticket, bros.

I can win you

Cousin Squid?

07:32.368 --> 07:33.661
What?!

07:33.744 --> 07:35.496
What did you call me?!

07:35.580 --> 07:36.622
"Squid."

07:36.706 --> 07:39.041

The name's Maurice.

I-I mean, Twister.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.840
You guys, come on,
let's hit the ride!

08:02.481 --> 08:06.861
( siren and whirring start up )

08:06.944 --> 08:10.740
{\an4}I hope the Squid
wore an extra pair
of underpants.

08:28.633 --> 08:29.508
{\an1}It's him.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.554
I got to...

08:33.638 --> 08:34.222
I got to...

08:34.304 --> 08:36.724
I got to do that again!

08:37.975 --> 08:39.809
My turn!

08:39.894 --> 08:41.437
{\an1}Hey, me first,
I've been waiting.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.272
Besides, you're
watching Scotty.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.232
Look--

08:44.315 --> 08:45.775
I'll watch
little Scotty

08:45.858 --> 08:47.068
after my ride

08:47.151 --> 08:48.444
so you can get
torpedoed.

08:48.527 --> 08:49.445
{\an1}You will?

08:49.528 --> 08:52.990
What are babysitters
for, Cousin Squid?

08:53.074 --> 08:56.744
You're not my babysitter,
and my name is Maurice.

08:56.827 --> 08:57.828
I-I mean, Twister.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.413
Ugh!

09:02.375 --> 09:03.668
Huh?

09:03.751 --> 09:04.919
Little Scotty?

09:05.002 --> 09:06.170
Oh, man!

09:06.254 --> 09:08.839
Scotty, Scotty!

09:08.923 --> 09:11.175
Little Scotty,
where are you?!

09:13.302 --> 09:16.138

{\an1}Enough with
this puppy, already!

Your mom's
gonna totally flip.

Got to win that ring

There he is!

10:59.116 --> 11:00.409
Oh, there you are.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.370

we'd find you.

11:05.956 --> 11:07.625

I'm fishing.

11:07.708 --> 11:12.963
Don't you ever...

11:17.176 --> 11:17.760
What?

11:19.720 --> 11:22.098
Hey, thanks.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.516
{\an1}I think
the ring looks cool.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.434
{\an1}I'm not afraid
of spiders, you know.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.521
How about we share a soda, cuz?

11:28.604 --> 11:30.940
You called me "cuz."

11:31.023 --> 11:33.609
Does that mean I'm
not little anymore?

11:33.692 --> 11:36.320
{\an1}Oh, that's
so cool, Maurice.

11:37.405 --> 11:40.449

11:53.421 --> 12:01.262
{\an8}♪♪

12:01.345 --> 12:10.813
{\an8}♪♪

12:10.896 --> 12:14.150
{\an1}There's a storm brewing
out there.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.235
It's getting
so gnarly.

12:16.318 --> 12:19.321
Only a brainless fool would
try and ride this surf.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.282
{\an1}The Rhino rides
these waves,

12:21.365 --> 12:24.160
and if the Rhino
can, so can I.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.494
{\an1}Excuse me.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.998
The Rhino is only the greatest
big-wave surfer there is,

12:29.081 --> 12:30.875
and you're...you.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.543
Hey, Twist,
what do you say?

12:32.626 --> 12:33.335
Let's try it.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.796
I don't know, Otto-Man.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.173
{\an1}Usually Twister has
the bad ideas.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.257
We can do this.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.676
{\an5}Just say "no,"
Twist.

12:40.759 --> 12:42.803
It's just a little water.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.389
Actually, it's quite
a lot of water.

12:46.557 --> 12:50.519
Twister, think
about this.

12:50.603 --> 12:54.899
{\an8}♪♪

12:54.982 --> 12:59.195
I am absolutely not
gonna do this!

12:59.278 --> 13:01.864
{\an1}So, we're really
gonna do this?

13:01.947 --> 13:05.409
{\an8}♪♪

13:05.493 --> 13:08.787
Twist, these are the kind
of waves you dream about!

13:12.583 --> 13:13.959
( hooting )

13:15.794 --> 13:18.547
Yeah! See you in the lineup!

13:18.631 --> 13:21.217
{\an8}♪♪

13:21.300 --> 13:23.219
( moaning )

13:23.302 --> 13:25.262
( panting )

13:25.346 --> 13:27.097
Oh, man!

13:28.224 --> 13:30.434
Come on, Twist,
this is it!

13:30.518 --> 13:33.562
Paddle, baby, paddle!

13:33.646 --> 13:35.523
I promise if I
make this wave

13:35.606 --> 13:36.440
{\an1}I won't talk back
to my teachers,

13:36.524 --> 13:37.733
I won't talk back
to the policeman,

13:37.816 --> 13:39.193
{\an1}I won't talk back
to the movie screen.

13:39.276 --> 13:43.572
( panting )

13:43.656 --> 13:46.742
( both screaming )

13:46.825 --> 13:48.661
I can't look.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.704
This is gonna hurt.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.917
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

13:55.000 --> 13:56.627
( both screaming )

13:56.710 --> 14:01.924
{\an8}♪♪

14:02.007 --> 14:04.843
( both screaming )

14:04.927 --> 14:07.930
( both panting )

14:08.013 --> 14:10.599
Are you guys okay?!

14:10.683 --> 14:13.102
( groaning )

14:13.185 --> 14:15.229
I think so.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.567
You guys could have got
whomped beyond belief!

14:19.650 --> 14:22.945
You mean, we didn't?

14:23.028 --> 14:26.156
<i>That's right, it's the</i>
<i>storm of the century.</i>

14:26.240 --> 14:27.449
<i>How will we</i>
<i>ever survive?</i>

14:27.533 --> 14:30.452
( television shuts off )

14:30.536 --> 14:32.955
I guess business is
gonna be a little off.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.873
You know the old
Hawaiian saying:

14:34.957 --> 14:37.793
{\an3}When surfers don't ride,
potatoes ain't fried.

14:37.876 --> 14:40.296
{\an1}Otto: When surfers
don't ride?

14:40.379 --> 14:41.297
I've ridden these waves.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.216
You were out there,
Little Cuz?

14:44.300 --> 14:45.551
Yeah, what's
the big deal?

14:45.634 --> 14:46.594
( slurping )

14:46.677 --> 14:47.970
What's the big deal?

14:48.053 --> 14:50.431
Do you like
getting in trouble,

14:50.514 --> 14:52.308
or do you just have
a memory problem?

14:52.391 --> 14:55.561
You're a kid, Otto, and
you're not experienced enough.

14:55.644 --> 14:56.395
Those waves are
out of control.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.981
I can handle it.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.150
I think he likes
getting in trouble.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.820
Otto, you're a good surfer,
and if you want to get better,

15:04.903 --> 15:06.822
you have to be smart enough
to know your own limitations.

15:06.905 --> 15:10.868
But, Dad, you
don't understand.

15:10.951 --> 15:11.535
I understand.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.538
You know, 25 years back,

15:14.622 --> 15:16.165
Hurricane Monica hit,

15:16.248 --> 15:19.168
and I hit the most
out-of-control wave of my life,

15:19.251 --> 15:22.296
that I wasn't near
experienced enough to handle.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.506
Hey!

15:24.590 --> 15:28.344
Whoa! Aaaah!

15:28.427 --> 15:31.472
I wrote a check
my tush couldn't cash.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.225
( humming )

15:40.439 --> 15:43.025
Oh! Ow!

15:43.108 --> 15:45.611
Tito: Yeah, you should have
seen his tush bounce.

15:45.694 --> 15:48.614
( laughter )

15:48.697 --> 15:51.867
{\an1}And that's why none of you
are gonna surf in this storm.

15:51.950 --> 15:54.244
Well, he convinced me.
I'm going home,

15:54.328 --> 15:58.082
{\an3}gonna sit on the couch,
watch TV, safe and sound.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.542
I hear ya, Raymundo.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.585
You got it, Dad.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.296
But lots of guys
surf the big waves.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.214
What about the Rhino?

16:05.297 --> 16:07.341
Raymundo:
You're not the Rhino.

16:07.424 --> 16:10.094
{\an1}The Rhino's a lot older and
a lot more experienced.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.554
You kiddin'?
He's done it all.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.723
He is so hardcore.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.643
Not an exaggeration.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.062
The Rhino.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.563
The Rhino?

16:21.647 --> 16:24.149
{\an3}Heard the surf's gonna be
insane here tomorrow.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.860
Hey, they're calling for the
biggest surf of the decade.

16:26.944 --> 16:30.781
It's gonna be Big Thursday.

16:30.864 --> 16:33.200
You gonna paddle out,
Rhino?

16:33.283 --> 16:35.452
That's what I do,
little man.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.830
Bad timing, bruddah.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.791
Easy on the big story,
Walter.

16:40.874 --> 16:42.000
Got it?

16:42.084 --> 16:44.336
Come on, Ray.
Rhino, not Walter.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.255
Walter? Ha-ha!

16:46.338 --> 16:49.925
To me, big waves
are like monsters --

16:50.008 --> 16:52.511
monsters you need to
go eye-to-eye with.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.430
But if you don't
face down the monsters,

16:54.513 --> 16:56.765
you might as well
boogie-board.

16:56.849 --> 16:57.725
Monsters scare me.

16:57.808 --> 17:01.437
How cool is this guy.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.272
Cool?

17:03.355 --> 17:11.488
{\an8}♪♪

17:11.571 --> 17:13.240
( muttering )

17:17.911 --> 17:19.954
( both panting )

17:20.038 --> 17:24.585
Glad you could
make it, kid.

17:24.667 --> 17:27.296
Get ready to see
some <i> real</i> surfing.

17:27.378 --> 17:30.340
Reggie: Otto, wait!

17:30.424 --> 17:31.508
Hold it, guys!

17:31.592 --> 17:33.761
( panting )

17:33.844 --> 17:35.888
Please, don't go
out there, Otto!

17:35.971 --> 17:37.806
You're gonna get
really whomped!

17:39.808 --> 17:41.727
Ughhh!

17:41.810 --> 17:43.645
( seaweed plops )

17:43.729 --> 17:46.315
Maybe your
sister's right!

17:46.398 --> 17:47.232
Don't do it, Otto!

17:47.316 --> 17:49.193
You do what
you want, Twist!

17:49.276 --> 17:50.986
I'm going out there
with the Rhino!

17:51.069 --> 17:53.322
I'm gonna ride me
one of them monsters.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.285
Can I have your
skateboard?!

17:59.745 --> 18:03.540
( grunting )

18:03.624 --> 18:05.167
I don't believe he's
actually doing this.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.504
Go get my dad.
I'll keep an eye on Otto.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.255
Hurry!

18:14.134 --> 18:16.345
Otto: Hey, Rhino!

18:16.428 --> 18:18.555
What are you doing
out here, kid?

18:18.639 --> 18:21.600
Are you nuts?

18:21.683 --> 18:24.895
I'm chasing the
monster surf, Rhino.

18:24.978 --> 18:28.732
You're writing a check your
tush can't cash, little man.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.235
Why does everyone
always tell me that?

18:31.318 --> 18:34.154
Honestly!

18:36.240 --> 18:37.574
Tito: Looks like you're
the Old Maid, bruddah.

18:37.658 --> 18:41.495
( boys panting )

18:41.578 --> 18:43.789
What?!
What is it?

18:43.872 --> 18:45.833
O-O-Otto is --
Otto is --

18:45.916 --> 18:47.668
Surfing with
the Rhino!

18:48.418 --> 18:51.338
Grrr!

18:51.421 --> 18:56.343
{\an8}♪♪

18:56.426 --> 19:01.348
{\an8}♪♪

19:01.431 --> 19:03.350
She's the one!

19:03.433 --> 19:04.893
Oh, will you
look at that!

19:04.977 --> 19:07.563
Oh, man, what am I
doing out here?

19:07.646 --> 19:09.648
( grunting )

19:13.193 --> 19:15.362
Yeah, baby!
Come to Mama!

19:17.823 --> 19:19.616
( grunting )

19:19.700 --> 19:21.994
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!

19:22.077 --> 19:22.494
I'm losing it!

19:22.578 --> 19:26.415
Aah! He-e-lp!

19:26.498 --> 19:28.250
Yeah, baby! Yeah! Ugh.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.085
Yeah-eah!

19:30.168 --> 19:36.466
{\an8}♪♪

19:36.550 --> 19:37.259
( panting )

19:41.096 --> 19:44.349
I am Rhino!
Hear me roar!

19:46.894 --> 19:49.897
Wow! Look at Rhino!

19:49.980 --> 19:53.108
Oh, bruddah,
look at the Otto.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.902
Let's go, Tito.

19:54.985 --> 19:55.611
Let's go pronto.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.779
( both panting )

19:57.863 --> 20:00.282
( both grunt )

20:00.365 --> 20:07.581
{\an8}♪♪

20:07.664 --> 20:10.626
( panting )

20:10.709 --> 20:12.419
Otto!

20:12.502 --> 20:16.131
Little rocket bruddah,
where are you?!

20:16.632 --> 20:19.927
Aaaah!

20:20.010 --> 20:20.677
( muffled screaming )

20:20.761 --> 20:23.597
Help! Ugh!

20:23.680 --> 20:25.933
( panting )

20:26.016 --> 20:28.644
Do you see him, Tito?

20:28.727 --> 20:30.479
( panting )

20:30.562 --> 20:31.396
Tito?

20:34.441 --> 20:35.651
Otto: Dad!

20:35.734 --> 20:39.529
( groaning )

20:42.240 --> 20:44.284
Otto! Come here!

20:44.368 --> 20:45.160
Son, grab on!

20:45.243 --> 20:48.622
I gotcha.
You'll be okay, son.

20:48.705 --> 20:51.166
Just hold o-o-on!

20:51.250 --> 20:53.001
Okay, Dad!

20:53.085 --> 20:58.840
{\an8}♪♪

20:58.924 --> 21:01.093
Ugh. Whoa.

21:01.176 --> 21:02.761
Whoa! Aaah!

21:02.844 --> 21:05.847
Aaah! Ugh!

21:05.931 --> 21:07.933
Ugh!

21:09.601 --> 21:11.853
( both panting )

21:11.937 --> 21:14.564
Reggie: Oh,
you guys are okay!

21:14.648 --> 21:15.941
Oh, man!

21:16.024 --> 21:17.651
Oh, no, where's Tito?!

21:17.734 --> 21:19.820
( panting )

21:19.903 --> 21:22.030
Dad, I'm so sorry.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.367
I hope...Tito's okay.

21:28.495 --> 21:31.873
Alo-ha-a-a!

21:31.957 --> 21:34.042
Aah! Whoa!

21:34.126 --> 21:34.543
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

21:34.626 --> 21:37.129
Whoa!

21:37.212 --> 21:38.880
Ugh!

21:38.964 --> 21:42.217
Whoo! That was some
crazy ride, Otto.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.219
Sorry, Tito.

21:44.302 --> 21:45.929
( grunts )

21:46.013 --> 21:48.223
I don't think he'll be
needing this for a while.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.434
Rhino: I am Rhino!

21:50.517 --> 21:53.145
Hear me roar!

21:55.355 --> 21:56.398
You know, I think

21:56.481 --> 21:59.651
I'll have a little
talk with the Rhino

21:59.735 --> 22:02.279
about being a
role model for kids.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.531
Oh, Walter?

22:04.614 --> 22:05.532
Rhino: Yeah, dude?

22:05.615 --> 22:09.036
( punches landing )

22:09.119 --> 22:11.997
Rhino has some
thinking to do.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.583
We discussed the responsibility
of being a role model.

22:14.666 --> 22:18.670
Really reasonable, sweet guy,
once you get to know him.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.175
( pop )

22:23.258 --> 22:24.926
Whoa.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.053
Ouch.

22:26.136 --> 22:30.098
( sea gulls calling )

22:30.182 --> 22:31.475
Otto: I really
messed up, Dad.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.435
I should have never
been out there.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.270
It was way over my head.

22:35.353 --> 22:37.606
Now you know
your limitations.

22:37.689 --> 22:40.942
{\an1}Maybe someday you'll be able
to ride the big waves.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.945
{\an1}I just hope you really
learned something today.

22:44.029 --> 22:47.324
{\an3}Like I should never bounce
checks that my tush can't cash?

22:47.407 --> 22:49.868
( chuckles )

22:49.951 --> 22:52.287
Almost. Almost.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.414
I should never balance
my tush on a check?

22:57.918 --> 23:05.842
{\an8}♪♪

23:05.926 --> 23:15.644
{\an8}♪♪

23:15.727 --> 23:24.486
{\an8}♪♪

23:24.569 --> 23:32.494
{\an8}♪♪

23:38.917 --> 23:41.878
{\an8}Otto: I should never
check my tush for cash?
