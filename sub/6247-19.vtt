00:01.880 --> 00:05.236
<i>Even all these months after
Katrina ravaged New Orleans,</i>

00:05.320 --> 00:09.916
<i>human remains are still being found in
devastated neighbourhoods across the city.</i>

00:10.000 --> 00:14.630
<i>Cadaver dogs are being used to search
for 2300 people still unaccounted for.</i>

00:14.720 --> 00:19.236
<i>Makeshift morgues still exist in warehouses,
schools, and churches throughout the area.</i>

00:19.320 --> 00:21.356
<i>Officials are finally beginning to admit</i>

00:21.440 --> 00:24.876
<i>what many people have known
since the levees broke long ago.</i>

00:24.960 --> 00:26.951
<i>Many of these people
will never be found.</i>

00:27.040 --> 00:30.589
- You look tired, Mike. Late night?
- Oh, yeah. Late and nasty.

00:30.680 --> 00:35.879
- Same kinky creature?
- Doc, the girI carries a serious perv swerve.

00:35.960 --> 00:38.349
Feeling wrong feels so good.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.151
- Sorry, Dr Brennan.
- No, it's fine.

00:42.240 --> 00:45.596
Males often bond by
exaggerating sexuaI conquests.

00:45.680 --> 00:51.755
Mike's not exaggerating. This girI is turned on
by coffins. Mike'll take her into the cooler...

00:51.840 --> 00:55.469
<i>Some libidos are inflamed
by proximity to death.</i>

00:55.560 --> 00:59.348
- Who's that?
- My assistant Zack, back in DC.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.557
<i>Congratulations on your coffin sex.</i>

01:03.400 --> 01:05.595
I've got work to do.

01:05.680 --> 01:10.754
<i>Some of the information you've sent seems
to have come from remains already embalmed.</i>

01:10.840 --> 01:14.196
Bodies were unearthed by the flooding.

01:14.280 --> 01:17.238
<i>They have to be ID'd and reburied.</i>

01:17.320 --> 01:19.436
I could fly down there to help.

01:19.520 --> 01:22.034
<i>A, tomorrow's my last day,</i>

01:22.120 --> 01:25.954
<i>and B, the sex-on-the-coffin
thing is not guaranteed.</i>

01:26.920 --> 01:32.233
You know, there are reasons they call this
the Big Easy. Even after Hurricane Katrina.

01:36.720 --> 01:40.349
Dr Brennan... meet John Doe 361.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.874
Found him in the Ninth Ward,
sticking out of the mud.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.793
Good afternoon, Detective
Harding. Male, 40s.

01:45.880 --> 01:49.236
- Badly decomposed, looks pretty banged up.
- Yeah.

01:49.320 --> 01:52.995
Be nice to know if it was hurricane,
flood, or fouI play that killed him.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.548
Detective, have you been
into the cooler lately?

01:55.640 --> 01:59.155
Apparently some libidos are
inflamed by the proximity to death.

01:59.240 --> 02:05.270
God, Graham, thinking about sex in this place should be illegaI
- If it ain't already.

02:06.320 --> 02:10.312
<i>Oh, Sam, I'm going to
need x-rays on this one.</i>

02:11.440 --> 02:14.557
Looks like there's something
lodged behind his teeth.

02:14.640 --> 02:18.076
You've been working 48 hours
straight. You need the evening off.

02:18.160 --> 02:20.151
I only have one vacation day left.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.550
Are you doing penance for FEMA?
Let me cook you dinner tonight.

02:23.640 --> 02:27.076
- I don't know.
- Come on. I'm a Southern gentleman, ma'am.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.958
- Your honour will be respected.
- Yeah.

02:30.040 --> 02:35.876
<i>Tell you what, Graham. We'll see what the x
- rays tell us about this one and then, maybe,</i>

02:35.960 --> 02:38.269
we'll get a bite to eat.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.673
All right.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.392
Agh!

03:34.920 --> 03:37.514
<i>Dr Brennan, your
airport shuttle is here.</i>

03:37.600 --> 03:39.397
What?

03:39.680 --> 03:41.671
No. Um...

03:43.080 --> 03:45.230
My flight isn't untiI Thursday.

03:45.320 --> 03:48.312
<i>Today is Thursday, Dr Brennan.</i>

03:51.760 --> 03:54.035
What happened to Wednesday?

03:54.120 --> 03:57.829
<i>Dr Brennan? Hello? Are
you there, Dr Brennan?</i>

04:29.760 --> 04:33.548
Looks like someone stole your earring.
Ripped it right out of the lobe.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.677
- I don't know what happened to me.
- It's a tough town.

04:36.760 --> 04:41.072
We don't have many cops any more, and...
they were never that good to begin with.

04:41.160 --> 04:46.439
- Shouldn't insult the ones that stuck around.
- Detective, I didn't... know who else to call.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.715
I need blood samples on this clothing.

04:48.800 --> 04:53.191
Maybe we'll get lucky and they won't all
come from you. Still hazy on the details?

04:53.280 --> 04:55.748
I'm not hazy on the details, I...

04:55.840 --> 04:58.149
- I don't remember anything.
- Nothing?

04:58.240 --> 05:05.078
Dr Leger knocking over a tray of
instruments at the morgue, then... nothing.

05:05.160 --> 05:08.596
- That was the day before yesterday.
- I requested a rape kit.

05:08.680 --> 05:11.638
No sign of sexuaI activity,
forced or otherwise.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.358
- You can't go in!
- Are you OK?

05:13.440 --> 05:15.749
- Booth, I told you not to come.
- Who's this?

05:15.840 --> 05:20.595
- He's FBI. We're sort of partners.
- Guy flies from DC, you're more than sort of.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.717
<i>Yeah, that's great.
You remember anything?</i>

05:23.800 --> 05:26.712
- Tray falling over.
- Why can't she remember anything?

05:26.800 --> 05:30.759
- It could be the head injury.
- Hairline fracture on my right distaI radius.

05:30.840 --> 05:35.868
Concussion. Slight fever. Torn earlobe.
I lost one of my favourite earrings.

05:35.960 --> 05:39.111
You should really be worried
about losing a whole day.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.192
I know. It's stupid. But these
earrings were my mother's.

05:42.280 --> 05:46.558
Amnesia caused by any traumatic
event - injury or drug -

05:46.640 --> 05:48.949
can erase memories before
the event, notjust after.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.998
- We'll wait for a tox screen.
- It'll be at least 24 hours.

05:52.080 --> 05:55.709
- 24 hours?
- Most labs were destroyed by the hurricane.

05:55.800 --> 06:00.157
We'll find out what happened. You
just take care of your, uh... partner.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.672
Another present from the bayou.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.513
I keep asking for a baby
tee that says "the Big Easy".

06:10.600 --> 06:12.556
We're all hoping for that.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.313
For you, I mean.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.517
Does our funding allow us to
do Dr Brennan's vacation work?

06:18.600 --> 06:22.752
We're just doing what the feds didn't.
It's the yin-yang of government spending.

06:22.840 --> 06:26.719
- So we're sneaking?
- That's what makes it fun.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.392
John Doe 361.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.754
Wow.

06:31.840 --> 06:34.229
Bad things happened to Mr Doe.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.796
<i>It'll come back, Bones.</i>

06:36.880 --> 06:39.792
<i>You don't know that. Head
injuries are unpredictable.</i>

06:39.880 --> 06:42.269
<i>I'm just being reassuring.</i>

06:42.360 --> 06:43.349
Brennan.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.796
Regarding the x-rays of John Doe 361.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.030
John Doe 361?

06:49.120 --> 06:50.997
Yes. You sent his x-rays.

06:51.080 --> 06:53.753
<i>- I don't remember that.
- You don't remember?</i>

06:54.320 --> 06:58.199
- What about the x-ray, Zack?
- Male, late 40s, mixed-race.

06:58.280 --> 07:02.671
Anomalies on his spine, which I'm looking
into. His death was not accidentaI.

07:02.760 --> 07:06.639
<i>- I sent you the x-rays of a
murder victim? - How'd he die?</i>

07:06.720 --> 07:09.473
<i>- Is that Booth?
- Y es.</i>

07:09.560 --> 07:13.951
You're hopping the streetcar named
Desire with Booth? Oh, I love this.

07:14.040 --> 07:17.794
Obviously they're working the
murder of John Doe 361 together.

07:17.880 --> 07:20.678
Precisely. How did 361 die?

07:20.760 --> 07:23.911
The pelvis shows crush fractures.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.959
There's what appears to be a bullet hole
in the skull, but there's no exit wound.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.270
<i>OK, keep working on it.</i>

07:30.360 --> 07:32.874
- You don't remember the case?
- No.

07:32.960 --> 07:36.157
And it's a murder. Oh, I'm hungry.

07:36.240 --> 07:41.030
When was the last time you
ate? My bad. You have amnesia.

07:41.120 --> 07:44.157
Booth. I think I know a place.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.470
What is the last thing you do remember?

07:47.560 --> 07:52.395
I told you. Graham - Dr Leger - knocked
over a tray of surgicaI instruments.

07:52.480 --> 07:57.076
- I want to talk to Leger.
- He was about to examine John Doe 361.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.799
Dr Brennan! I thought
you were leaving today.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.872
Peter, this is my friend Seeley Booth.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.394
- My God, what happened to you?
- I'm not certain,

08:05.480 --> 08:08.597
but the bruising suggests Tuesday night.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.240
- After you left here?
- I was here Tuesday?

08:11.320 --> 08:14.357
- What time?
- In at eight, left at nine.

08:14.440 --> 08:18.831
Don't you remember? You
had dinner with Sam Potter.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.352
Bones. Bones.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.795
- We have to go to the morgue, talk to Sam.
- Who's Sam?

08:26.880 --> 08:30.031
- He's an orderly. He practises voodoo.
- Bones, wait up.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.514
<i>- Y ou invited me to dinner.
- Why?</i>

08:36.799 --> 08:39.597
You found this in the
mouth of a John Doe.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.318
<i>Let me see that.</i>

08:44.400 --> 08:47.312
- That's voodoo?
- It's a grigri bag. It's a mojo.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.630
This one is meant to silence the dead.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.870
Usually dead people
are silent on their own.

08:51.960 --> 08:56.033
Voodoo embraces the premise that spirits
can speak to us from beyond the grave.

08:56.120 --> 08:59.237
Voodoo is all about the
balance of the forces.

08:59.320 --> 09:04.314
That wind, the flood, this death
- it's all out of balance now.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.153
Katrina was Armageddon for
the ones who love balance.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.800
Some think it was Secte
Rouge that brought it on.

09:09.880 --> 09:13.077
- What's that? Some kind of a gang?
- The ones who follow eviI.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.517
Some believe they angered the sirens
who sent the flood. This is Secte Rouge.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.909
So that's literally bad voodoo?

09:21.560 --> 09:25.473
It's black gum root. There's
only one place you can find it -

09:25.560 --> 09:30.190
a voodoo shop on Pontchartrain
Avenue run by Richard Benoit.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.317
He's a good man. Maybe he can help you.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.868
OK. Thanks.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.520
Dr Brennan, a lost day?

09:39.400 --> 09:41.630
Perhaps a spell was cast on you as well.

09:41.720 --> 09:45.713
No disrespect, Sam, but...
it's not my religion.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.514
Come on, Booth.

09:51.600 --> 09:55.912
<i>- Voodoo? Who's gonna believe that?
- It's a religion, no crazier than...</i>

09:56.000 --> 09:58.468
- Well, what are you?
- Catholic.

09:58.560 --> 10:01.438
They believe in the same
saints you do, and prayer.

10:01.520 --> 10:04.318
What they call spells,
you call miracles.

10:04.400 --> 10:08.075
- We don't make zombies.
- Jesus rose from the dead after three days.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.515
<i>Brennan.</i>

10:10.600 --> 10:13.114
Jesus is not a zombie.

10:13.200 --> 10:16.078
All right? Man, I shouldn't
have to tell you that.

10:16.160 --> 10:21.439
On John Doe 361 there's a narrowing
of the disc space on L2 and L3.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.110
- CongenitaI?
- Unclear.

10:24.200 --> 10:28.398
Extensive injuries consistent with a
body being thrown around by a flood.

10:28.480 --> 10:32.268
Cross-reference what you know with
the records of missing Katrina victims.

10:32.360 --> 10:35.318
Hey, Brennan. Why haven't you come home?

10:35.400 --> 10:37.391
<i>Pretty soon, Ange.</i>

10:37.480 --> 10:40.278
- Is Booth there socially?
- Of course not.

10:40.360 --> 10:42.749
- What's going on?
- Bones has amnesia.

10:42.840 --> 10:46.150
A man put a spell on her to stop her
solving the murder of John Doe 361.

10:46.240 --> 10:50.631
- That's a huge supposition.
- That's fine if you don't want to tell me.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.830
Ha. Voodoo amnesia.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.753
- It's a good one. Mm-hm.
- Hm. Yeah. It's great.

10:56.840 --> 11:00.230
Brennan's fighting zombies in
New Orleans and we're stuck here.

11:07.200 --> 11:12.115
- Whoa. What's that smell?
- I imagine everything smells in here.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.679
Whoa.

11:14.720 --> 11:19.919
<i>Please just tell me that
that car survived Katrina.</i>

11:20.000 --> 11:24.073
- We used it to evacuate.
- Did you restore it or did you use voodoo?

11:24.160 --> 11:25.593
<i>Ah.</i>

11:25.680 --> 11:27.910
An unbeliever.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.154
- What can I do for you?
- Do you, uh... do you know what that is?

11:33.240 --> 11:36.437
<i>This is a dark spell,
forbidden magic. Very strong.</i>

11:38.760 --> 11:43.117
This is Secte Rouge. I certainly
wouldn't make anything like this.

11:43.200 --> 11:48.228
- But you have the ingredients here?
- The individuaI ingredients aren't malignant.

11:48.320 --> 11:52.916
It is how they are combined and what they
are used for that makes a spell good or bad.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.197
- Do you recognise me?
- No. Should I?

11:57.480 --> 12:01.189
- Anyone else work here?
- My daughter. Eva.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.238
- What is this about?
- We're conducting an investigation.

12:04.320 --> 12:07.232
Eva! What kind of investigation?

12:07.320 --> 12:10.153
Is this the only place a
person can buy black gum root?

12:10.240 --> 12:13.835
Yes. Most places like
this are all gone now.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.588
It's not a coincidence.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.557
Yes, Daddy?

12:25.640 --> 12:28.518
Have you ever seen this lady before?

12:28.600 --> 12:31.319
- No. Why?
- We need to know who's bought this lately.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.994
Don't they need a warrant?

12:34.080 --> 12:38.153
Eva will pull up what you
need on the computer. Eva.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.800
What you said
- what did you mean, "a coincidence"?

12:40.880 --> 12:45.032
Most places like this,
where a houngan, a priest,

12:45.120 --> 12:49.352
can get what he needs...
they are all gone now.

12:49.440 --> 12:54.150
- Because of the hurricane and flood.
- Which occurred through a lack of balance.

12:54.240 --> 12:59.439
Mr Benoit, are you suggesting that Secte
Rouge somehow conjured up a hurricane?

12:59.520 --> 13:02.034
Secte Rouge voodoo is
more powerfuI than ours.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.112
No, Eva, not more powerfuI.

13:05.600 --> 13:09.036
Destruction is easier than
harmony, but not more powerfuI.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.918
There are a lot of
misunderstandings about voodoo.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.472
Yeah, that whole zombie stuff puts a
crimp in your public relations, I bet.

13:17.560 --> 13:23.237
These are the people who have bought
black gum root in the past month.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.788
Graham Leger, the medicaI examiner.

13:27.480 --> 13:31.439
<i>- I tried to get in touch with him.
- He was scheduled to be in the field.</i>

13:32.960 --> 13:34.393
Graham.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.950
- It's Temperance!
- What if he's not here?

13:38.480 --> 13:42.473
He's probably asleep. He's
been working nights. Graham!

13:43.480 --> 13:45.198
- Graham?
- Cracker.

13:45.280 --> 13:50.559
Hey, that's not funny. I think he invited me to
dinner that night, or drinks. I can't remember.

13:50.640 --> 13:53.359
You know what? Maybe he roofied you.

13:53.440 --> 13:58.116
I'm sure he bought the black gum root
to look into its medicinaI qualities.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.475
Because we all know
how effective that is.

14:00.560 --> 14:05.714
Voodoo healing is quite effective, no
crazier than acupuncture or exorcism.

14:05.800 --> 14:09.429
Hey, hey. Easy on the
Catholics, OK? Just easy.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.556
Bones.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.990
Here we go again.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.877
Bones!

14:28.160 --> 14:30.390
You OK?

14:30.480 --> 14:34.075
<i>Something bad happened here, and...</i>

14:34.160 --> 14:36.151
I got away.

14:52.440 --> 14:55.910
Oh, yeah. Something bad.

15:11.240 --> 15:14.437
- What exactly were you doing here?
- It's Graham, isn't it?

15:14.520 --> 15:17.239
Tell you what. I'm going
to ask the questions.

15:17.320 --> 15:20.392
- Come on. She was working with the guy.
- How closely?

15:20.480 --> 15:24.314
<i>- What's that supposed to mean?
- Answer my question, please.</i>

15:24.400 --> 15:29.190
What brought you here? Was it a
sociaI call? Business? Revenge killing?

15:29.280 --> 15:33.114
Leger bought black gum root from the
voodoo store. We stopped by to ask why.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.953
- Why?
- That's what we came here to ask.

15:36.040 --> 15:39.919
Want to look behind me and remind
yourselves why I'm a little low on humour?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.434
- That wasn't ajoke.
- She's not wisecracking.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.670
She just tends to be a bit literaI.

15:44.760 --> 15:47.513
The day before yesterday I
showed a voodoo expert a mojo

15:47.600 --> 15:50.478
that Graham found lodged in
the mouth of John Doe 361.

15:50.560 --> 15:54.792
This voodoo consultation, did
it occur before or after amnesia?

15:54.880 --> 15:58.077
- The amnesia's reaI.
- Graham purchased a rare ingredient

15:58.160 --> 16:00.230
at a voodoo shop on Pontchartrain Ave.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.356
So Graham made voodoo spells,

16:02.440 --> 16:05.955
shoved them into corpses' mouths and
acted surprised when he found them?

16:06.040 --> 16:07.189
What's that?

16:07.280 --> 16:09.874
Split cast, huh? More voodoo.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.520
Just like the symboI on the wall.

16:13.360 --> 16:15.954
- Bag it as evidence.
- Secte Rouge?

16:16.040 --> 16:18.838
- What do you know about Secte Rouge?
- We're gonna go.

16:18.920 --> 16:23.869
I'm gonna tear this place apart. If I find one
piece of evidence that ties you to the scene,

16:23.960 --> 16:25.916
I will take you into custody.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.278
Do you really think someone could go into
a trance, commit a murder, and not remember?

16:30.360 --> 16:34.035
No, I don't. But I sure as hell
think someone can fake amnesia.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.872
Great. Thank you, Detective.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.951
These are what you and Graham
worked on the day before yesterday.

16:43.040 --> 16:48.353
James, meet Agent Seeley Booth. Dr
Embry is Graham's second in command.

16:48.440 --> 16:52.672
- Condolences on your sudden promotion.
- Um... um...

16:52.760 --> 16:55.991
Why do you think the job had anything
to do with Graham being killed?

16:56.080 --> 16:59.117
Bones has voodoo amnesia,
Leger is voodoo dead,

16:59.200 --> 17:02.636
and the last thing they worked
on was a voodoo rituaI murder,

17:02.720 --> 17:05.678
so I'm thinking there might
be some kind of a connection.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.751
Leger's body...

17:08.680 --> 17:12.150
- Is it as bad as they say?
- How bad are they saying it is?

17:12.240 --> 17:15.073
No matter how bad they're
saying it is, it's worse.

17:15.160 --> 17:18.117
I just want to mentally prepare myself.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.839
I start his autopsy in a few minutes.

17:20.920 --> 17:23.513
The file I need is John Doe 361.

17:23.599 --> 17:27.194
According to records, these are the
only cases you worked on that day.

17:27.280 --> 17:31.910
Four sets of remains. Two were easy IDs
- drown victims, processed for buriaI.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.470
The other two were both males
- John Does 349 and 350.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.313
I sent 361's x-rays
to the Jeffersonian.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.112
I'll check again.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.029
- Can I make a lifestyle suggestion?
- Go ahead.

17:47.120 --> 17:50.032
<i>You know, "vacation", it's
from the Latin vacatio.</i>

17:50.120 --> 17:53.271
It means "freedom". You might
want to consider that next time.

17:53.360 --> 17:57.558
- Learning Latin?
- This is the opposite of vacation.

17:57.640 --> 18:00.837
No wonder you snapped, went
insane and totally lost your mind.

18:00.920 --> 18:04.993
- Oh, thanks for your understanding.
- Dr Brennan, there's no John Doe 361.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.674
Then whose x-rays did I send to DC?

18:07.760 --> 18:09.751
No, I mean the file is gone.

18:17.920 --> 18:19.638
- OK. Hold that.
- Got it.

18:19.720 --> 18:23.679
<i>- Zack Addy.
- It's me. Anything else on John Doe 361?</i>

18:23.760 --> 18:27.958
Yes, Dr Brennan. We found some damage to the pubic bone
- some kind of strike marks.

18:28.040 --> 18:32.511
<i>- Did Angela reconstruct the pattern?
- Y eah, hi, sweetie. I'm here.</i>

18:32.600 --> 18:36.195
I tried to make a digitaI
positive, but it didn't work.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.191
- Why?
- Voodoo, probably.

18:38.280 --> 18:42.432
<i>The extrapolation protocols can't resolve
the gradient fluxes in the bone shadings.</i>

18:42.520 --> 18:44.875
- What's that?
- Mumbo jumbo. Scientific voodoo.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.315
<i>- Can you do it
manually? - Off an x-ray?</i>

18:47.400 --> 18:50.472
- Mm, not really.
- Can't you send the actuaI remains?

18:50.560 --> 18:52.835
<i>- They don't exist.
- That makes no sense.</i>

18:52.920 --> 18:55.354
- Voodoo. It's probably voodoo.
- Voodoo?

18:55.440 --> 18:59.228
- OK, quit saying "voodoo".
- Yeah, because, you know, it's not a factor.

18:59.760 --> 19:01.955
OK, let me know what you find. Bye.

19:02.040 --> 19:05.510
How do we know this is not the guy
shoving mojo bags into dead people?

19:05.600 --> 19:08.592
Those spells are the work of a sorcerer.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.638
Priests, houngans, can make
healing mojos, but I won't.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.199
But snake shaking is fine?

19:13.280 --> 19:16.955
The snake pulls the eviI out of the
souI, freeing the spirit, the loa.

19:17.040 --> 19:21.636
I must do what small things I can. The
floods washed away too much of what was good.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.314
Bones, how about while
you're a murder suspect,

19:24.400 --> 19:28.996
you act more like a normaI woman
and less like Lily Munster, OK?

19:29.080 --> 19:32.550
Bye-bye. Good
snake. Bye-bye.

19:32.640 --> 19:35.677
Call me crazy, but I'm
suspicious of snake man.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.320
You've been inculcated by
the mainstream culture's

19:38.400 --> 19:43.599
prevailing Judeo-Christian tradition into
instinctive scepticism of alternative mores.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.672
Yeah. Thanks for that explanation.

19:48.720 --> 19:52.076
- I've been over every inch
of these x-rays. - Me too.

19:52.160 --> 19:55.914
There's evidence of particles on the
bones, but no way of knowing what they are.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.310
- Probably dirt.
- Yes, thank you, Zack.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.994
But "dirt" is a meaningless word.

20:03.480 --> 20:06.199
- You can't see air
on an x-ray. - What?

20:06.280 --> 20:09.477
I never said you could. I'm
not even talking about air.

20:09.560 --> 20:14.076
You can see a space where air might be,
like a cavity, but not the air itself.

20:14.160 --> 20:19.075
What I'm saying is that yes, there are
flecks on the x-ray that might be dirt,

20:19.160 --> 20:21.435
but that doesn't tell us anything.

20:21.520 --> 20:26.036
Is it sandy? Silty? Humusy? Is it
clay? Is it more organic than mineraI?

20:26.120 --> 20:30.875
Is it soiI? Is it pulverised graveI? What
minerals are in it? Are they crystalline?

20:30.960 --> 20:35.636
These are all details a person cannot get off
an x-ray, no matter how long he stares at it.

20:35.720 --> 20:39.713
Sometimes a person should look for things
that aren't there instead of things that are.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.791
You mean me? In dirt?

20:41.880 --> 20:44.348
No. Me, on the x-ray.

20:44.440 --> 20:48.513
I've been looking for anomalies which
exist instead of anomalies which don't.

20:48.600 --> 20:53.071
Zack, if you are ever going to
successfully mimic being human,

20:53.160 --> 20:58.553
you have to stop making everything about
you and feign interest in the other guy.

20:58.640 --> 21:02.110
- Zack!
- I've noticed that you try to look taller.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.077
- When?
- Around Dr Brennan.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.993
- I do not.
- And Angela.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.275
Because they're both taller than you.

21:09.360 --> 21:13.273
You know what? I take it back. Don't
take any interest in the other guy.

21:13.360 --> 21:15.351
Thank you for your help.

21:16.800 --> 21:21.157
<i>So do you remember anything
else that could help us out?</i>

21:22.160 --> 21:24.355
- It could have been me.
- You remember that?

21:24.440 --> 21:26.271
Look at it objectively.

21:26.360 --> 21:32.117
Graham Leger was killed between
11pm Tuesday and 3am Wednesday.

21:32.200 --> 21:38.992
Not only do I not have an alibi, I... I
can't even explain to myself where I was.

21:40.320 --> 21:42.754
It could have been me.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.479
- No, it couldn't.
- Yes... How do you know?

21:45.560 --> 21:48.597
I'd bet my professionaI career on it.

21:48.680 --> 21:51.478
- I already did.
- What? What did you do?

21:51.560 --> 21:55.792
Bones, stop! This is the last time
and place that you want to be rationaI.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.555
Let's be wildly emotionaI and
assume you didn't murder a co-worker

21:59.640 --> 22:02.313
who invited you over for dinner.

22:03.360 --> 22:04.588
- What's that?
- What?

22:04.680 --> 22:06.636
That.

22:08.200 --> 22:09.474
Ew!

22:09.560 --> 22:11.790
It's another voodoo dumpling?

22:11.880 --> 22:15.998
It's some kind of flesh...
and these are sea shells.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.071
And leather, I think.

22:19.320 --> 22:22.517
- Is that a human tooth?
- Yes. A canine.

22:25.560 --> 22:28.711
- Put down your weapon.
- Put down yours. There's no threat from us.

22:28.800 --> 22:32.315
- You're holding a gun on me.
- My finger is not on the trigger.

22:32.400 --> 22:36.871
It's the best I can do
under the circumstances.

22:36.960 --> 22:41.556
Holster your weapons. I'm here to arrest
Dr Brennan for the murder of Graham Leger.

22:41.640 --> 22:43.710
- That's not gonna happen.
- It is.

22:43.800 --> 22:48.920
- I told you, Booth.
- Please! Just once in your life be quiet!

22:49.000 --> 22:53.551
That's good advice as everything you say can
and will be held against you in a court of law.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.108
- What is that?
- I... I found it on my pillow.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.475
<i>Bones!</i>

22:58.560 --> 23:02.109
- Thank you, Dr Brennan.
- What's the probable cause?

23:02.200 --> 23:07.069
Traces of Dr Brennan's blood in Leger's
home, Leger's blood on her clothing.

23:07.160 --> 23:10.152
- Is that it?
- AII I'm prepared to share.

23:10.760 --> 23:14.799
- Now, please, step away from my collar.
- I'm afraid I can't let that happen.

23:14.880 --> 23:19.431
- Bones! Jeez!
- It's better if nobody else dies.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.750
You know what? I wasn't
planning on dying.

23:21.840 --> 23:25.310
Agh! It's not you I worry about. Ow!

23:25.400 --> 23:28.870
You're welcome to the
room. It's paid for.

23:46.120 --> 23:49.078
Were you sleeping with Graham Leger?

23:49.160 --> 23:51.549
I don't... I don't think so.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.551
You don't think so?

23:53.640 --> 23:59.351
I don't remember doing so, and at the clinic
they said there was no sign of sexuaI activity.

23:59.440 --> 24:03.319
- I hope you've kept your mouth shut.
- Temperance Brennan, Caroline Julian.

24:03.400 --> 24:06.551
She's your lawyer. She's
from the US Attorney's office.

24:06.640 --> 24:10.315
You found a prosecutor to
defend her? Interesting tactic.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.834
I've told Detective
Harding everything I know.

24:12.920 --> 24:16.469
- You didn't tell me she's a fooI.
- She's a forensic anthropologist.

24:16.560 --> 24:19.632
I have three degrees,
I've pioneered research...

24:19.720 --> 24:24.396
- What's that?
- A grigri bag. I found it in my hoteI room.

24:24.480 --> 24:29.600
I assume the person who left it is trying to
frame me, so the tooth is probably Graham's.

24:29.680 --> 24:33.434
Three degrees and still a fooI.
This interview is over, Rose.

24:33.520 --> 24:37.433
I need to speak with my client alone
before she gives herself a lethaI injection.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.829
Of course. Of course.

24:39.920 --> 24:42.434
It's nice seeing you again, Caroline.

24:42.520 --> 24:46.433
- What the hell were you talking to her for?
- I was just trying to help.

24:46.520 --> 24:51.435
Sew those lips together, because there is no
such thing as helping the New Orleans police.

24:51.520 --> 24:54.557
They just want to close the
case as quickly as they can.

24:54.640 --> 24:58.997
- You are making it Christmas time for them.
- There's no way that Bones killed Leger.

24:59.080 --> 25:04.154
- It's just not her. Look at her!
- I am doing you a favour taking this case.

25:04.240 --> 25:08.677
But as the lady cop says, I'm a
prosecutor, and as it stands now,

25:08.760 --> 25:11.513
I could try this case in my
PJs and still get a conviction.

25:11.600 --> 25:15.149
Shouldn't you get to know your clients
before you make snap judgements?

25:15.240 --> 25:19.392
- Bones!
- Fine. Stop me when I get something wrong.

25:19.480 --> 25:23.553
"Trained in three types of martiaI
arts, two assault charges. "

25:23.640 --> 25:26.108
"Registered marksman with the NRA."

25:26.200 --> 25:29.078
- "Hunting licences in four states. "
- You hunt?

25:29.160 --> 25:31.196
- Only for food.
- "Shot an unarmed man. "

25:31.280 --> 25:34.078
He was trying to set me on fire.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.754
Just arrange baiI for us
so we can get out of here.

25:36.840 --> 25:39.912
Sure, sure. Don't wanna
get this one mad at me.

25:43.120 --> 25:46.157
You couldn't keep your
mouth shut, could you?

25:46.240 --> 25:50.711
- I can identify this guy.
- Angela isn't that much taller than me.

25:50.800 --> 25:54.998
Spina bifida. He had a shunt from
his brain stem down to his heart.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.355
It was removed more than a decade ago.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.637
- We both like Brussels sprouts.
- You don't like Brussels sprouts.

26:00.720 --> 26:03.280
A man can change, Zack.

26:07.560 --> 26:08.834
<i>A human tooth?</i>

26:08.920 --> 26:14.517
Yeah. Some kind of flesh, some fabric.
It looked like some kind of shell.

26:14.600 --> 26:17.990
Yeah, sounds like... to make you forget.

26:18.080 --> 26:20.799
Somebody doesn't want
you to know what happened.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.997
- Booth, I'm not under a spell.
- Well, you forgot a whole day.

26:24.080 --> 26:30.394
The spirits don't need you to believe
in them, Dr Brennan. They believe in you.

26:30.480 --> 26:33.074
See you back at work, huh?

26:34.840 --> 26:37.070
How did I get away?

26:37.880 --> 26:40.440
Graham got killed, I got
away. How did I do that?

26:40.520 --> 26:43.398
Bones, all those things
that Caroline mentioned,

26:43.480 --> 26:47.632
the martiaI arts, the
shooting, the assaults.

26:47.720 --> 26:50.871
You're the type of woman that
fights. Maybe they didn't expect it.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.235
Maybe they thought magic could hold you.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.675
- I don't believe in magic.
- Exactly.

26:55.760 --> 27:00.276
You're a surprising woman. Sometimes
that's enough for getting away.

27:02.040 --> 27:04.235
Why are you nice to me?

27:05.360 --> 27:09.194
- Because they think they get away with it.
- What?

27:09.280 --> 27:13.478
They burn their victim, blow 'em up, toss
'em in the ocean, bury them in the desert.

27:13.560 --> 27:17.269
They throw 'em into wood
chippers. Sometimes years go by.

27:17.360 --> 27:20.875
They relax and start living their
lives like they did nothing wrong.

27:20.960 --> 27:24.316
Like they didn't spend somebody
else's life to get what they got.

27:24.400 --> 27:27.676
They think they're safe
from retribution, but...

27:27.760 --> 27:32.515
You make those bastards unsafe.
That's why I'm nice to you.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.591
I couldn't do that without you, Booth.

27:34.680 --> 27:38.389
Yeah. So you should be a
little nicer to me, huh?

27:42.000 --> 27:43.797
I really should.

27:43.880 --> 27:47.475
<i>I walk in on something?
Beignet and a café, chérie.</i>

27:47.560 --> 27:50.677
<i>- Yes, ma'am.
- HospitaI records.</i>

27:50.760 --> 27:54.389
- The tox screen was negative.
- What? That's impossible.

27:54.480 --> 27:57.392
- No RohypnoI or ketamine?
- Nothing but a touch of alcohoI.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.835
Not enough to affect a baby.

27:59.920 --> 28:03.151
Ajury is never gonna
believe this amnesia story.

28:03.240 --> 28:05.959
- But it's true.
- Maybe this is true too.

28:06.040 --> 28:09.953
Leger tried to rape you.
He was a notorious horn dog.

28:10.040 --> 28:13.077
We claim self-defence, cop a
plea, you're out in three years.

28:13.160 --> 28:16.914
I don't care what it looks like or how
you read the evidence. She didn't do it.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.278
Could be that's true, Seeley. You vouch
for her, that's good enough for me.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.351
<i>But, chérie, this looks bad.</i>

28:23.440 --> 28:26.671
All you've got on your side
is proof you got roughed up.

28:26.760 --> 28:30.912
These pictures from the
clinic, these x-rays.

28:31.000 --> 28:35.835
My wrist. The doctor was wrong. He said
this was a Colles' fracture from a fall.

28:35.920 --> 28:38.559
This break shows surface
trauma on the bone.

28:38.640 --> 28:42.315
This was either defensive or someone
slammed my wrist into something.

28:42.400 --> 28:45.358
Maybe cos you tried to stab
him in the heart with a knife?

28:45.440 --> 28:51.709
No, if I'd already stabbed the attacker, he
wouldn't have been able to break my wrist.

28:51.800 --> 28:54.758
- I like this story. What else?
- There's the mojo bag.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.638
- Someone tried to put a spell on her.
- Booth!

28:57.720 --> 29:01.474
I can work with that. This is New
Orleans. And where is my beignet?

29:01.560 --> 29:04.996
- Brennan.
- John Doe 361 is named Rene Mouton.

29:05.080 --> 29:06.308
<i>How can you be sure?</i>

29:06.400 --> 29:09.437
I looked for something that wasn't there
- a shunt channeI.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.511
<i>- Good work.
- You understood that?</i>

29:11.600 --> 29:14.398
<i>All Zack had to do was
cross-check with DMORT.</i>

29:14.480 --> 29:16.630
I only thought of it because of Hodgins.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.871
I can discern particulates on the
x-ray, but don't know what they are.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.269
- Some kind of dirt?
- OK, everybody,

29:22.360 --> 29:26.035
the word "dirt" means nothing
here in the lab, scientifically.

29:26.120 --> 29:28.839
Any progress on the
design in the pelvic bone?

29:28.920 --> 29:31.673
<i>I've tried three different
computer programs.</i>

29:31.760 --> 29:37.232
I fed in the information into multiple impact
scenarios, but this won't work on x-rays.

29:37.320 --> 29:41.393
<i>- I need the actuaI remains.
- Booth and I are looking for them.</i>

29:41.480 --> 29:44.472
Or better, you could forget
the whole thing and come home.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.357
Don't worry. I made baiI.

29:46.440 --> 29:47.031
BaiI?

29:47.120 --> 29:48.917
BaiI? For what?

29:49.000 --> 29:52.231
I told you, don't worry. The
murder charge won't stick.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.914
Whoa! Murder charge?!

29:55.000 --> 30:00.472
Brennan. The next plane. The next plane
or I'm coming down there to get you myself.

30:00.560 --> 30:04.872
Everything's fine. I'm healing
up satisfactorily. Bye for now.

30:04.960 --> 30:07.599
<i>Healing up?</i>

30:07.680 --> 30:13.596
You know what? This whole state of affairs
where Brennan runs around fighting crime,

30:13.680 --> 30:16.433
it's stupid, it's nuts.

30:16.520 --> 30:18.829
Don't you agree?

30:18.920 --> 30:21.798
Go, go. I'll be fine.

30:25.560 --> 30:29.678
Brennan will be fine, Angela. She got
baiI and the murder charge won't stick.

30:29.760 --> 30:33.116
- What is going on with her?
- Angela.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.158
- She started to change the day she met you.
- What?

30:36.240 --> 30:42.713
Well, she sees how you do it. All
fun and involvement and pizzazz.

30:42.800 --> 30:46.156
Big, you know. A big life.

30:47.080 --> 30:52.473
Booth came along and gave her the
opportunity, but she got the idea from you.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.950
Brennan wants a big life, like yours.

30:59.400 --> 31:05.589
That's how it looks to me anyway, but what
do I know? I'm a bug guy. Bug and slime.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.671
And, you know... dirt.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.551
- Yeah.
- So...

31:13.240 --> 31:15.231
OK.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.390
According to bureau files, Rene
Mouton headed a small voodoo church.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.948
By all accounts, he was a very good man.

31:30.040 --> 31:34.272
He rescued scores of people during
Katrina, then he just disappeared.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.238
Some thought he was just swept
away when the levee broke.

31:37.320 --> 31:40.949
- Why would anyone murder him?
- Chaos during the evacuation.

31:41.040 --> 31:46.160
- It could even have been for a bottle of water.
- Or... because he was a priest.

31:46.240 --> 31:50.153
The grigri bags, the murder
of Dr Leger, your amnesia.

31:50.240 --> 31:53.949
This is the work of a bokor,
a Secte Rouge sorcerer.

31:54.040 --> 31:57.828
Rene Mouton was a houngan, a
powerfuI and well-loved priest.

31:57.920 --> 32:02.038
For Secte Rouge to claim his souI, it'd give
them influence on the people he influenced.

32:02.120 --> 32:05.476
- Like a chain letter?
- Or somebody who wanted his shoes.

32:05.560 --> 32:07.551
- No, Booth, it makes sense.
- What does?

32:07.640 --> 32:10.871
- Graham and I were on the traiI of a broker.
- Bokor.

32:10.960 --> 32:13.679
And he found out. Or Secte Rouge did.

32:13.760 --> 32:18.038
Great. Then we just toss the ring into
the molten river and blah, blah, right?

32:18.120 --> 32:23.035
In the meantime, somebody here had the
ability to hide Mouton's body and files.

32:23.120 --> 32:25.588
- James Embry? Mike Doyle?
- Me?

32:25.680 --> 32:29.434
Say you wanted to hide a body and didn't
want it found, where would you put it?

32:31.200 --> 32:34.795
If I wanted to hide a body, I'd
change the name tag on the coffin.

32:34.880 --> 32:39.476
- Not Mouton. Too young.
- He's buried and the evidence is gone.

32:39.560 --> 32:45.192
Female. I find it hard to believe that
horny little Mike Doyle is a voodoo sorcerer.

32:45.280 --> 32:46.918
Whoa!

32:47.000 --> 32:50.629
- Me too.
- Speak of the deviI. It's Mike Doyle.

32:50.720 --> 32:53.109
And he's not alone.

32:57.200 --> 33:00.158
- You said to avoid the police.
- Not cooperating is one thing.

33:00.240 --> 33:03.835
Concealing a double homicide? We might
as well give them an excuse to hang us.

33:03.920 --> 33:06.388
Dr Embry says that you can
identify the bag of bones.

33:06.480 --> 33:10.473
The skeletaI remains belong to a man
named Rene Mouton. His skull is missing.

33:10.560 --> 33:13.757
Looks like Doyle was drugged,
a spike driven through his head,

33:13.840 --> 33:16.559
during or immediately
after sexuaI intercourse.

33:16.640 --> 33:22.033
It appears that Dr Brennan, Dr Embry and
Sam Potter could have pulled this off.

33:22.120 --> 33:27.353
Sam Potter brought us to the body.
We called you in. Who does that leave?

33:27.440 --> 33:31.035
There's no security in this place.
Anyone could have gotten in here.

33:31.120 --> 33:35.636
You said Mike was having sex when he died.
He must have been killed by the coffin girI.

33:35.720 --> 33:36.948
- What?
- What's her name?

33:37.040 --> 33:40.112
- I never got her name.
- Is there a mojo in Doyle's mouth?

33:40.200 --> 33:44.318
- I don't feeI comfortable releasing...
- She's a sorcerer. She works for Secte Rouge.

33:44.400 --> 33:48.109
Detective Harding, I know this, you
know, sounds superstitious, but...

33:48.200 --> 33:50.873
Three murders and a
world-renowned anthropologist

33:50.960 --> 33:54.430
who can't remember how she ended up
smeared with the blood of a skinned man

33:54.520 --> 33:58.638
crucified to a wall with
spikes? Call me superstitious.

33:58.720 --> 34:00.392
Excuse me.

34:00.480 --> 34:06.669
May I scatter fwan ginea over
Mr Mouton? To purify his remains?

34:06.760 --> 34:09.797
No more voodoo crap! I don't
want you contaminating the body.

34:09.880 --> 34:12.792
- What is it?
- Ashes from a rituaI fire pit.

34:12.880 --> 34:16.270
Ashes from a dove's feather.
Salt mixed with holy water.

34:16.360 --> 34:20.989
- OK, we get the idea.
- It should have no effect on the bones.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.271
Fine. Fine, go ahead.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.954
<i>- Whoa! Did you see that?
- Very interesting phenomenon.</i>

34:40.040 --> 34:43.554
The electrostatic charge of the
particles reacted with the bone.

34:43.639 --> 34:48.031
Angela was unable to recreate that pattern
from the x-rays using top technology.

34:48.120 --> 34:52.670
Electrostatic my ass. That was part of
an emblem of a 1959 Caddy... Oh, boy!

34:52.760 --> 34:56.036
- What?!
- The voodoo shop guy owns a 1959 Cadillac.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.997
He's got a voodoo daughter.

35:00.560 --> 35:03.279
- You're taking my Caddy?
- We have reason to believe

35:03.360 --> 35:06.397
that your Caddy was used in the
wrongfuI death of Rene Mouton.

35:06.480 --> 35:09.677
You think someone did a hit and
run on Rene Mouton in my Caddy?

35:09.760 --> 35:11.990
- Yes.
- Does your daughter have a boyfriend?

35:12.080 --> 35:14.230
Yeah.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.311
This him?

35:17.680 --> 35:20.069
- Mike Doyle. Yeah. Why?
- We need to speak to...

35:20.160 --> 35:23.072
I mean Detective Harding needs
to speak to your daughter.

35:23.160 --> 35:28.553
- I don't know where she is.
- She's a suspect in the murder of Mike Doyle.

35:28.640 --> 35:32.030
- Why would Eva kill her boyfriend?
- It's hard to explain.

35:32.120 --> 35:35.795
She was involved in a hit and run.
When the body surfaced at the morgue,

35:35.880 --> 35:39.156
she asked her boyfriend to help hide
it. He refused so she killed him.

35:39.240 --> 35:42.516
- Also, she's a member of Secte Rouge.
- No. No.

35:42.600 --> 35:48.709
I bet there are drugs in the shop that
could knock me out, make me forget.

35:55.480 --> 35:57.755
Eva is downstairs praying.

36:05.400 --> 36:06.879
Eva.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.951
Eva, open the door.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.512
No... No!

36:13.600 --> 36:15.750
Eva! Eva!

36:25.160 --> 36:27.230
Oh, no! No!

36:27.320 --> 36:29.311
Booth.

36:30.880 --> 36:33.678
<i>- Could that be Mouton's skull?
- Yes.</i>

36:33.760 --> 36:39.073
And this could be the spike that
she used on Mouton and Mike Doyle.

36:39.160 --> 36:44.553
This is the lair of a bokor, someone
who can call the dark spirits.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.075
This is used for
rituaI animaI sacrifice.

36:48.160 --> 36:51.709
It's heated to red hot to cauterise
the wound so it wouldn't bleed.

36:51.800 --> 36:54.394
She killed herself because
she knew we were coming?

36:54.480 --> 36:58.598
- No. No, not my Eva.
- She drove the spike through her sternum?

36:58.680 --> 37:01.911
Sternum, heart, through the
chest cavity, through the spine.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.195
- Can I open this?
- Why?

37:04.280 --> 37:06.271
This holds the souI of Mr Rene Mouton.

37:06.360 --> 37:09.272
- I believe this holds the souI of the bokor.
- Shut up!

37:09.360 --> 37:12.557
I'd like to release Mr Mouton's
souI so no other bokor can use it.

37:12.640 --> 37:17.714
- No. It's evidence. Don't touch it.
- I raised my Eva to be a houngan, a healer.

37:17.800 --> 37:21.634
- How could this happen under my nose?
- Rebellious adolescent?

37:21.720 --> 37:25.349
Do you remember how much of the
spike was protruding through her back?

37:25.440 --> 37:26.953
Six, eight inches?

37:27.040 --> 37:30.635
Would the fact the spike was red hot
cause it to go through the body easier?

37:30.720 --> 37:33.439
No. It might even make it harder.

37:36.600 --> 37:39.478
- Eva Benoit did not commit suicide.
- Based on what?

37:39.560 --> 37:42.120
This room isn't even 12 feet wide.

37:42.200 --> 37:45.636
Even if she ran at full
speed and her aim was perfect,

37:45.720 --> 37:52.034
no way the spike would go through her
spine, unless she was pushed onto it.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.876
He is the sorcerer.

37:55.960 --> 37:59.509
He believes he can
bring her back to life.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.510
OK, everyone just simmer down, OK?

38:02.600 --> 38:05.910
You say he murdered his daughter
so he could bring her back to life?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.150
Then you stop looking
for Mouton's murderer.

38:08.240 --> 38:11.949
An inch or two to the left or right,
we would never have known it was murder.

38:12.040 --> 38:16.477
It would have been hard pushing her onto
the spike, especially if she were resisting.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.552
You'd have some wounds of your own.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.349
There's your killer.

38:26.440 --> 38:28.908
- I'd really like to go home now.
- Yeah, me too.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.037
My advice, cuff Mr Wizard here
before he puts a spell on you.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.678
No written confession?

38:33.760 --> 38:36.797
Threaten to release his
daughter's souI and he'll confess.

38:36.880 --> 38:41.476
Dr Temperance Brennan, you leave
here, you go home, it does not matter.

38:41.560 --> 38:47.669
There are powers. Dark powers, to
whom distance makes no difference.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.352
<i>Easy, buddy.</i>

38:49.440 --> 38:50.873
Hey!

38:56.520 --> 39:02.197
I've noticed that very few people are
scary once they've been poked in the eye.

39:06.120 --> 39:09.192
I got in the middle of a battle
between two religious sects.

39:09.280 --> 39:14.274
Benoit used Hurricane Katrina as a diversion
to take the souI of a voodoo priest.

39:14.360 --> 39:17.875
- And he killed his own daughter?
- Dark sorcerers suck, man.

39:17.960 --> 39:20.269
Oh, but he intended to
bring her back to life.

39:20.360 --> 39:23.477
There's not really any such
thing as spells and magic.

39:23.560 --> 39:26.711
What? He put a forgetting
hex on Dr Brennan.

39:26.800 --> 39:30.679
It wasn't the spell that made me forget. It was the drugs
- RohypnoI.

39:30.760 --> 39:33.638
- Blood test didn't find any.
- Gamma hydroxybutyrate?

39:33.720 --> 39:35.676
- Not a trace.
- Sodium pentothaI?

39:35.760 --> 39:38.115
- Nope.
- Severe emotionaI trauma?

39:38.200 --> 39:41.033
Honey, even I think you're
too strong-minded for that.

39:41.120 --> 39:44.908
There were too many delays in my
blood test. That, plus the adrenaline,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.070
the drugs were out of my system.

39:47.160 --> 39:49.720
They put the voodoo on you, baby.

39:52.960 --> 39:58.273
- I didn't really mean to call you "baby".
- You guys, stop. Now. I mean it.

39:58.360 --> 40:03.036
Do you believe in voodoo? Even if a small
part of you believes in it, then it has a grip.

40:03.120 --> 40:05.839
- I do not believe.
- Maybe just a little?

40:05.920 --> 40:07.353
- No.
- If you have any doubts,

40:07.440 --> 40:11.877
we'll get Benoit to send you back one of
those little satanic mojo pouches from prison.

Objects have no intrinsic power. A person's
future does not depend on some thing.

40:18.960 --> 40:24.080
Things are just things. They do
not have magicaI meaning or powers.

40:28.040 --> 40:31.112
- Where did you get that?
- What does it matter?

40:31.200 --> 40:33.873

40:33.960 --> 40:39.512

It proves something.
