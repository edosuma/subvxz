WEBVTT

00:19.811 --> 00:21.271
<i>I felt hollow.</i>

00:22.105 --> 00:25.400
<i>All the anger emptied out of me
till just the sadness remained</i>

00:25.400 --> 00:28.904
<i>that I trusted the wrong people
and thought they felt the same.</i>

00:29.696 --> 00:32.616
<i>All I wanted now
was to get my passport from Didier</i>

00:32.616 --> 00:35.244
<i>and leave this place while I still could.</i>

00:56.265 --> 00:57.516
Linbaba.

00:57.516 --> 00:59.017
How you going, Siraj?

00:59.017 --> 01:00.352
Hi, Linbaba.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.074
He still hasn't come back?

01:14.825 --> 01:15.951
He'll be coming.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.122
He's probably getting ready to leave.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.750
If you lie, then a crow will bite you.
-So let it bite me.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.797
There was trouble.

01:30.007 --> 01:32.593
A man wanted to kill Linbaba.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.011
But we dealt with it.

01:34.011 --> 01:36.221
What do you mean, you "dealt" with it?
-No. Not me.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.265
Linbaba and...

01:39.850 --> 01:41.643
Khader's <i>goonda</i>, Abdullah.

01:41.643 --> 01:43.312
They did the fighting. I only--

01:43.312 --> 01:45.814
Lin should never have
dragged you into this.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.317
You should not have gotten involved.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.737
You need to be smart.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.656
He's my friend.

01:54.656 --> 01:58.118
What if your friend's <i>goonda</i> trouble
becomes your <i>goonda</i> trouble?

02:00.871 --> 02:02.497
Remember one thing.

02:02.497 --> 02:06.418
He will be gone in a few days, not you.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.753
Your life is here.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.508
Have you ever thought of that?

02:12.508 --> 02:14.843
Your decisions affect both of us.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.346
I don't want your friendship

02:17.346 --> 02:19.765
to leave you locked up in jail
and me without a husband.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.397
After today...

02:30.901 --> 02:32.736
no more risks for him.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.489
Swear to me.

03:02.057 --> 03:05.519
My mum used to look at me
like that when I was in real trouble.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.437
<i>Arre</i>, I was worried about you, <i>na?</i>

03:09.398 --> 03:12.818
You're fine?
No stabbings or bullets inside you?

03:13.694 --> 03:16.738
I'm all right, mate.
-Then why this look on your face?

03:21.577 --> 03:23.996
You're regretting
not following my advice, <i>na</i>?

03:24.496 --> 03:25.831
Did you find Maurizio?

03:28.375 --> 03:30.002
Yeah. He's alive. Don't worry.

03:32.921 --> 03:36.717
You were right, though, mate.
I should've just come back here with you.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.746
I think it is good news
that you did not kill Maurizio.

04:12.461 --> 04:14.838
You should be feeling happy about this,
not sad.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.807
I'm past caring about any of it.

04:26.558 --> 04:31.355
Karla, Khader and Abdullah,
they've been lying to me from the start.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.861
Everyone but you.

04:45.661 --> 04:49.998
As soon as Didier comes through, I'm gone.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.391
I followed Karla straight to the reporter.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.853
They must have all have been in on it
from the start.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.983
Lisa, Modena, Karla, fucking Lin Ford.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.902
You're a fool.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.529
Karla hates me,

05:20.529 --> 05:24.700
but she wouldn't dare make those moves
without Khader's permission.

05:26.618 --> 05:30.914
And Ford... he's Khader's man in the slum.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.000
What do we do now?

05:33.917 --> 05:37.504
They don't know that we know
about Karla's journalist.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.964
Call Walid Shah.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.302
Tell him I need to see him.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.226
Minister Pandey?

05:51.226 --> 05:52.394
Yes.

05:52.394 --> 05:53.687
My name is Kavita Khanna.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.356
I'm a reporter and I'd like to ask you
a few questions, sir.

05:56.940 --> 06:00.110
I'm very busy. All press requests
should be made through my office.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.445
I cannot talk to you now--

06:01.445 --> 06:04.823
Ah, I don't think this is a request
you want me to make through your office.

06:05.991 --> 06:09.161
I suspect you would not want them
to see these pictures,

06:09.161 --> 06:11.830
or for Walid Shah to know I have them.

06:12.623 --> 06:14.291
And I have spoken to Sunita.

06:14.791 --> 06:18.378
You can comment, Minister,
or I will simply write it without you.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.381
Either way, sir,
the story will be written.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.843
Get out. Now!

06:25.886 --> 06:27.429
You're a very nasty woman.

06:27.429 --> 06:30.098
Now, go away if you know
what is good for you.

06:36.897 --> 06:40.943
I see no reason for you
to take Sunita to Kavita Khanna,

06:40.943 --> 06:44.112
except to share
our recent actions with her.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.574
Is that a part of our plan that I missed?

06:48.617 --> 06:51.995
I did it for you. Before you get yourself
into even more trouble.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.122
And you couldn't tell me that
before you brought me here?

06:54.122 --> 06:55.707
I told him not to.

07:00.671 --> 07:02.548
The story I've given Kavita

07:02.548 --> 07:06.301
will frame Zhou and Walid
for Rujul's death and blackmailing Pandey.

07:07.845 --> 07:10.472
They'll be out of the picture,
and Sagar Wada will be yours.

07:10.472 --> 07:13.433
You'll still get what you want,
just not the way you intended.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.811
You did this without telling me.
-Yes.

07:15.811 --> 07:18.313
Because you knew I would stop it.
-Yes.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.857
Then you did not do it for me.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.025
Is this because of your hatred
for Madame Zhou?

07:22.025 --> 07:24.820
Nothing you can do
will bring back Ahmed or Christina.

07:24.820 --> 07:28.574
That guilt will never go aw--
-I did it for Lin. So he can stay.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.202
Lin asked you to do this?

07:32.995 --> 07:34.454
He never asked for anything.

07:36.039 --> 07:39.459
All this time we've used him, and I just...

07:41.545 --> 07:46.717
I'm sorry. Maybe that makes me weak,
not what you wanted me to be.

07:46.717 --> 07:47.885
But I've had enough.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.888
Does he know about our relationship?

07:51.972 --> 07:53.056
Yes.

07:53.557 --> 07:55.142
You told him?

07:55.142 --> 07:57.644
He worked it out himself
and hates me for it.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.441
Hmm.

08:02.441 --> 08:08.405
Then there is nothing to prevent you
from stopping the story.

08:09.740 --> 08:16.121
Love... is a chain
with a handcuff on both ends.

08:17.206 --> 08:20.042
We don't notice that
until the chain pulls tight.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.504
I never did any of this to hurt you.

08:23.504 --> 08:24.963
Of course.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.007
So then, you'll reconsider?

08:30.886 --> 08:33.222
Maybe there was too much sin
in my crimes after all.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.724
This will start a war.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.477
Walid will think I did this.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.270
You never considered that?

08:40.270 --> 08:42.105
Men will die. Men like Abdullah.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.691
You say you want to make me proud,
then you put a gun to my head,

08:44.691 --> 08:46.527
as certain as the one
that killed your father.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.529
That is my reward?

08:52.741 --> 08:53.867
Karla, wait.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.285
Let her go!

09:02.626 --> 09:04.628
Get Lin.

09:12.928 --> 09:13.971
Qasim.

09:15.264 --> 09:16.807
Johnny.
-Linbaba.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.272
If you're not coming, wh--
what am I doing here waiting?

10:06.273 --> 10:07.482
I know you're telling me that now,

10:07.482 --> 10:10.235
but what do I tell my customer
about his passport?

10:11.195 --> 10:15.032
I promised delivery today.
You know, I have a reputation to maintain.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.451
Then how long?

10:18.660 --> 10:21.079
Well, I cannot hand him your apology.

10:23.749 --> 10:24.750
Didier Levy?

10:26.710 --> 10:28.462
I'm Sub-Inspector Chavan Sharma.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.672
I need you to come with me
to the police station.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.260
Uh-- Can you tell me what this is about?

10:35.260 --> 10:36.845
Please, sir. Come with me.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.972
Now?
-Now.

10:55.197 --> 10:58.075
Linbaba. Have a drink, man,

10:58.075 --> 11:01.787
or we'll have to bury you in this hole,
and there won't be any room for the pipe.

11:03.789 --> 11:06.792
Qasim. Work is progressing on schedule?

11:08.168 --> 11:09.545
I'll let Khader know.

11:11.004 --> 11:14.341
Lin, Brother, have you quit your clinic
for the digging of ditches?

11:20.347 --> 11:21.598
Everything okay, Mr. Lin?

11:33.485 --> 11:34.570
What are you doing?

11:35.529 --> 11:37.322
Khader sent you to get me, right?

11:38.365 --> 11:40.284
He whistles, and you come running?

11:41.535 --> 11:42.661
Did you find Maurizio?

11:45.163 --> 11:47.708
Helping me out with Raheem
doesn't make up for the lies.

11:50.002 --> 11:51.628
I understand how you must be feeling.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.841
But I was caught between my father
and my brother.

11:55.841 --> 11:58.260
As long as you did not know,
I did not have to choose.

11:58.260 --> 12:01.638
Oh, so you just lied instead?
That's real brotherly.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.432
Khader is trying to do right.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.934
That means
he has to make difficult choices.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.562
But I trust his plan,
even when I don't understand it.

12:09.688 --> 12:12.566
After all this, mate,
I don't trust anybody.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.777
Not Khader and not Karla.

12:17.279 --> 12:18.322
Not you.

12:20.991 --> 12:21.992
Let's go.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.456
I will always be your brother.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.126
You have to choose if you will be mine.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.222
Walid.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.229
I didn't know
you made house calls, Madame.

12:50.812 --> 12:53.815
But I'm afraid, uh,
you're not to my taste, huh?

12:54.942 --> 12:58.362
There's going to be a time in your future
when you look back on this moment

12:58.362 --> 13:02.699
and wonder,
"If only I had not insulted her,

13:03.242 --> 13:05.285
everything would be different."

13:06.328 --> 13:08.163
Never heard of you leaving the Palace.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.374
I've never had reason,

13:10.374 --> 13:11.458
till now.

13:16.964 --> 13:21.093
Please, Madame, forgive my crass joke.
It was wrong, huh?

13:22.094 --> 13:23.595
And I apologize.

13:26.515 --> 13:29.560
Khader Khan plans to expose
your business with Minister Pandey.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.938
I don't know what you're talking about.
I know no Pandey.

13:34.565 --> 13:39.152
Pandey has a mistress,
a Kamathipura whore called Sunita.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.905
And how do you know this?

13:41.905 --> 13:44.324
Khaderbhai forced me
to help him get to the girl.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.493
I should kill you for just that.

13:47.202 --> 13:49.997
And he threatened me
for helping you with Rujul.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.669
I'm only trying to stay alive.

13:56.587 --> 13:58.297
Then why are you telling me this now?

13:59.256 --> 14:02.718
Khader plans to use a journalist
and bury us both.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.388
I don't have the means
to fight back on my own.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.183
I want them to pay.

14:09.808 --> 14:10.976
"Them"?

14:10.976 --> 14:14.104
Khader and Karla Saaranen.

14:16.732 --> 14:18.692
Does Khader know you found this out?

14:20.903 --> 14:22.196
Well, this is good.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.658
If you're right...

14:28.410 --> 14:32.206
then Khader has given me all the excuse
I need to finish him for good.

14:33.081 --> 14:37.127
You chose the right side, Madame.
What can I give you in return?

14:42.174 --> 14:44.009
Did you tell Karla to lead me on?

14:44.009 --> 14:47.554
No. Karla lied to me
about her feelings for you.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.973
That is why we find ourselves
where we are.

14:50.599 --> 14:53.852
Well, "Everybody, sooner or later,
sits down to a banquet of consequences."

14:53.852 --> 14:55.354
Oh, Lin.

14:56.605 --> 14:59.233
I do like you. No lie there.

14:59.233 --> 15:01.652
Well, excuse me
if I don't really give a fuck.

15:01.652 --> 15:03.195
Remember who you're speaking to.

15:04.738 --> 15:05.739
Oh, I do.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.618
The man who fed me some shit
about being my father in another life

15:09.618 --> 15:13.121
so he could use me to screw over the only
real friends I've got in this place.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.040
You will show some respect in this house.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.417
Or what?
-Uh, enough. Enough.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.502
Abdullah.

15:22.089 --> 15:25.008
I suspect Lin would say
that respect has to be earned.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.220
His anger is justified.

15:31.348 --> 15:32.641
I apologize, Lin.

15:33.517 --> 15:35.102
But things are moving fast, and right now,

15:35.102 --> 15:39.147
everything I have been working towards
for a very long time is in danger.

15:39.147 --> 15:43.110
I don't care. I'm leaving.
I'm done with all of you.

15:43.110 --> 15:46.071
Actually,
you are the cause of my problems.

15:50.409 --> 15:52.911
So, you brought me here
because you want something else?

15:54.079 --> 15:55.289
Oh, that is rich.

15:55.873 --> 15:58.917
Karla has given a news story
to Kavita Khanna

15:58.917 --> 16:01.128
so that you can stay in Sagar Wada.

16:01.879 --> 16:04.423
This story will start a war
with Walid Shah.

16:05.257 --> 16:08.385
But Karla is willing to throw away
everything she has worked for with me

16:08.385 --> 16:10.220
to give you what you want.

16:10.220 --> 16:13.599
I need you to convince Karla
to kill the story,

16:13.599 --> 16:15.267
or her life will be in danger.

16:16.768 --> 16:22.065
But, as you said, you're leaving,
so what do you care?

16:27.613 --> 16:29.031
You won't get far without this.

16:30.741 --> 16:32.409
Did you not think I would know?

16:32.409 --> 16:33.994
I control the book market.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.414
Oh, man.

16:39.583 --> 16:40.584
Blackmail?

16:43.295 --> 16:44.296
That's it?

16:46.340 --> 16:48.258
Fuck, you're just a fraud.

16:49.551 --> 16:53.472
A Wizard of Oz bullshit-merchant
pretending to be a philosopher.

16:53.472 --> 16:55.682
You really think he's got all the answers?

16:55.682 --> 16:58.227
Ask Karla to stop the story.

16:59.394 --> 17:02.397
Please. And this is yours, free of charge.

17:04.775 --> 17:06.443
Karla can make her own decisions.

17:08.487 --> 17:10.489
And I'll get by. One way or another.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.578
You deserve better, my brother.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.345
No, no, no. No!

17:33.345 --> 17:35.097
Just-- Just-Just-- I'm fine.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.855
Leave me. J-- Just go.

17:54.867 --> 17:58.036
Please tell me that you're here
to help me with these files.

17:59.246 --> 18:02.666
Look, you made your point. Believe me.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.336
I've been a prick. I apologize.

18:13.510 --> 18:14.553
Sincerely.

18:16.722 --> 18:17.764
Apology accepted.

18:20.726 --> 18:23.770
I found a man who will know
exactly where to find Lindsay Ford.

18:57.262 --> 19:01.558
You were stuck in here once before.
Lindsay Ford bailed you out, yeah?

19:02.267 --> 19:04.019
So I guess you know where to find him.

19:06.230 --> 19:08.065
May I ask who you are, sir?

19:08.732 --> 19:11.860
I'm Detective Walter Nightingale,
the Australian Federal Police.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.571
Yeah, I'm the man who locked up
Dale Conti--

19:14.571 --> 19:16.740
that's your mate's real name--

19:16.740 --> 19:19.201
for armed robbery and killing a cop.

19:22.621 --> 19:23.747
You've come a long way.

19:24.623 --> 19:26.083
I'm not going back empty-handed.

19:27.084 --> 19:30.587
Well... I barely knew, uh--
uh, Dale, or, uh, Lin,

19:30.587 --> 19:31.713
whatever you wanna call him.

19:31.713 --> 19:33.882
Barely? Barely?
-Yeah, I was just an acquaintance.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.467
Really?
-Yeah.

19:36.468 --> 19:37.469
He's your friend.

19:38.053 --> 19:39.638
I don't have friends.

19:40.472 --> 19:43.183
I find life more simple that way.

19:43.892 --> 19:46.061
Then I guess you'll have
no one to bail you out

19:46.061 --> 19:48.981
once Chavan buries you
back in those cells.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.665
I didn't expect to see you again.

20:07.749 --> 20:10.752
Whatever deal you've made with Kavita,
you need to cancel it.

20:11.253 --> 20:12.713
The deal she made for you?

20:13.630 --> 20:15.465
So you can stay in your precious slum.

20:15.465 --> 20:16.884
Lisa, don't.
-No.

20:16.884 --> 20:18.886
You didn't deserve
what he said last night.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.389
She's risked her life for you.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.516
So think on that
before you say anything else.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.393
You've spoken to Khader.

20:27.519 --> 20:28.520
Yeah.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.566
He said what you're doing
is gonna start a war.

20:36.570 --> 20:38.363
Then he showed me my new passport.

20:39.489 --> 20:42.784
Told me he'd give it to me
if I talked you out of the story.

20:42.784 --> 20:43.869
And what did you say?

20:43.869 --> 20:45.579
Told him to fuck off.
-Why?

20:45.579 --> 20:48.165
Because I'm not bending
to any more of his bullshit.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.543
That doesn't mean I want you in danger.

20:54.213 --> 20:58.050
Fuck, Karla.
Why couldn't you have just been honest?

20:58.717 --> 21:00.594
I didn't ask you to do any of this.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.974
I just wanted to be with you.

21:07.726 --> 21:09.061
That simple.

21:11.355 --> 21:13.649
Well, you don't need the passport
if you can stay.

21:13.649 --> 21:16.860
And you can stay now, Lin.
Let me give you that.

21:19.321 --> 21:20.822
I'm going.
-Why?

21:22.741 --> 21:24.952
Because nothing's the same anymore.

21:24.952 --> 21:28.205
So you can just carry on as you were,
like I was never here.

21:28.205 --> 21:29.915
Holy fuck.

21:29.915 --> 21:33.877
Can you two just move past the bullshit
and get it together?

21:35.504 --> 21:37.089
Everyone lies.

21:37.089 --> 21:39.174
Everyone does shit. So what?

22:01.989 --> 22:03.115
What do you want?

22:04.032 --> 22:05.033
Stay.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.871
Don't let it all be for nothing. Please.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.039
It's too late for me now.

22:26.972 --> 22:30.559
You're willing to risk jail, huh?
Or even worse, for Conti?

22:30.559 --> 22:33.604
He's a self-serving junkie scumbag.

22:33.604 --> 22:37.274
As I have said that the man you describe
is not the one I know.

22:37.274 --> 22:40.027
Mr. Levy,
all evidence points to the opposite.

22:40.736 --> 22:42.571
You know lying to the police is a crime?

22:43.155 --> 22:45.115
If you don't share
the information you know,

22:45.115 --> 22:47.117
I will have to take you to prison.

22:47.117 --> 22:48.869
And I don't think either of us wants that.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.000
I still can't help you.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.084
Chavan?

22:57.085 --> 23:00.589
I have information
for you and the <i>gora</i> about Lindsay Ford.

23:10.891 --> 23:12.351
Let's hear it.

23:12.351 --> 23:14.728
Lindsay Ford is living
in the Sagar Wada <i>jhopadpatti</i>.

23:14.728 --> 23:16.939
He's been doctoring
the people that are living there.

23:16.939 --> 23:18.941
How did you come by
this information, Sanjay?

23:18.941 --> 23:21.026
Who's paying for you to give us it?

23:21.026 --> 23:22.486
Just doing my duty, sir.

23:22.486 --> 23:24.238
First time for everything.

23:24.238 --> 23:25.697
I can take you right now.
-Uh...

23:26.949 --> 23:29.535
I'll need to assemble a team
before we enter the slum.

23:29.535 --> 23:31.328
Any arrest has to be made properly.

23:31.328 --> 23:33.288
Whatever you say, Chavan. It's your town.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.043
What about Laughing Boy in there?

23:38.043 --> 23:40.587
If we let Levy go,
he could lead us straight to Conti.

23:42.798 --> 23:44.007
We'll have him followed.

23:45.551 --> 23:47.427
If he goes to Lin Ford, then we know.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.935
It is time to repay the betrayals.

23:54.935 --> 23:58.647
Khader is old. His time has passed.

23:58.647 --> 24:01.191
He will not even see us coming.

24:01.191 --> 24:05.737
We are going to own fucking Bombay
when this is finished.

24:05.737 --> 24:08.657
We're going to hit his businesses,
safe houses.

24:08.657 --> 24:13.370
We're going to kill his puppets, Pandey,
Qasim Ali, Abdullah Taheri.

24:17.374 --> 24:18.625
And we will kill him.

24:48.363 --> 24:49.364
Hi.

25:17.935 --> 25:18.936
Ah.

25:31.114 --> 25:33.116
Here's the food at last.

25:39.998 --> 25:41.124
Drive!

25:57.182 --> 25:58.183
Hey.

25:58.183 --> 25:59.893
I'm going to the bathroom.

25:59.893 --> 26:02.563
Don't give anyone my table. I'm not done.

26:56.575 --> 26:57.951
Do you want this?

26:57.951 --> 26:59.786
Not my style, boss.
-Okay.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.496
Thank you. Take this.

27:01.496 --> 27:03.874
Hey, Lin.
-What are you doing here?

27:03.874 --> 27:06.627
There is an Australian cop in Bombay
looking for you.

27:08.879 --> 27:10.130
Nightingale?
-Yeah.

27:13.634 --> 27:15.552
We need to keep you out of sight.

27:16.345 --> 27:18.096
Sorry, your passport wasn't ready today,

27:18.096 --> 27:20.849
so, uh, we must find a place
where to hide you, right?

27:20.849 --> 27:21.934
Until I collect it.

27:22.518 --> 27:24.102
Khader Khan has my passport.

27:28.315 --> 27:31.777
Did you know about Karla and Khader,
that they work together?

27:33.862 --> 27:34.863
Yes.

27:35.447 --> 27:36.823
Course you fucking did.

27:37.533 --> 27:41.828
But, hey, I kept Karla's secret
the same way I would keep yours, huh?

27:41.828 --> 27:44.081
I'm Swiss in all these matters,
as you know.

27:45.123 --> 27:46.124
Yeah.

27:48.460 --> 27:51.505
So, K-- Khader didn't give you the--
the book?

27:52.422 --> 27:54.091
No, he's holding it over my head.

27:58.554 --> 27:59.555
Fuck him.

28:01.682 --> 28:02.683
Fuck him.

28:09.022 --> 28:11.066
Linbaba!
-Hey!

28:12.359 --> 28:15.070
What happened?
-<i>Goondas</i>. Walid's men.

28:15.070 --> 28:17.573
Put him in my hut.
-What? Uh, Lin, we have to go. We--

28:17.573 --> 28:18.907
I can't leave him like this.

28:18.907 --> 28:20.200
But...

28:20.200 --> 28:21.994
You're insane, <i>mon frère.</i>

28:23.203 --> 28:26.081
You know what? I'm-- I'm going to make
alternative arrangements, okay?

28:26.081 --> 28:27.541
But come as soon as you can...
-Okay.

28:27.541 --> 28:29.042
...yeah?
-Prabhu, find Parvati.

28:38.427 --> 28:40.304
This story's gonna be huge, Kavita.

28:40.304 --> 28:42.222
My editor's gonna
hold the front page for us.

28:43.473 --> 28:46.685
These land deals are a dirty secret
that no one wants brought to light.

28:47.227 --> 28:49.855
And Pandey refused to comment?
-He was terrified.

28:49.855 --> 28:52.357
He did not act like an innocent man.

28:52.357 --> 28:55.819
You're sure?
These are powerful, dangerous people.

28:55.819 --> 28:58.906
There could be consequences for all of us
if we publish this story.

29:00.449 --> 29:02.618
So, we let them get away with it?

29:02.618 --> 29:04.995
What's the point
if we're afraid to tell the truth?

29:04.995 --> 29:06.872
If we don't, we are no better than them.

29:08.248 --> 29:09.833
Think I wanna marry you.

29:11.335 --> 29:13.295
I'll take it under advisement.

29:13.295 --> 29:15.255
Right now, we have work to do.

29:15.255 --> 29:20.427
That people like this Zhou think they
can come here and live and act like this.

29:20.427 --> 29:23.055
What benefit does a woman like this
bring to Bombay?

29:23.055 --> 29:24.223
So, what now?

29:24.223 --> 29:26.892
I'll make an official request
to speak with Minister Pandey.

29:26.892 --> 29:29.978
I want you to add more detail
on the Palace and Madame Zhou in there.

29:30.562 --> 29:32.898
People love a sex scandal
more than anything.

29:33.482 --> 29:36.151
And then we'll shake them
with the exposure of the corruption.

29:37.986 --> 29:41.031
Are you sure you're ready?
There's no turning back.

29:42.866 --> 29:44.076
I'm more than ready.

29:52.125 --> 29:55.921
Thank you for taking a chance on me.
It means a lot.

29:57.214 --> 29:59.508
I know I wouldn't be here if not for you.

30:00.133 --> 30:03.637
I know talent when I see it.
Now hurry up with those rewrites.

30:16.567 --> 30:17.568
How do you feel?

30:20.445 --> 30:21.446
He-Head hurts.

30:25.784 --> 30:27.953
Okay, he needs to rest
and not move too much.

30:27.953 --> 30:29.705
I think he might have a concussion.

30:29.705 --> 30:32.791
So you need to make sure he stays awake,
knows who he is, where he is.

30:32.791 --> 30:34.042
He can have more--

30:34.042 --> 30:35.711
Qasimbhai.
-Qasim.

30:41.550 --> 30:46.138
There is a chai shop.
The <i>gora</i> runs his clinic nearby.

30:47.347 --> 30:49.933
Where does the <i>gora</i> doctor live?

30:52.769 --> 30:53.770
Huh?

31:04.948 --> 31:06.575
What's wrong?

31:08.160 --> 31:11.622
I think he might have a hematoma.
Bleeding in the skull.

31:11.622 --> 31:12.581
How bad is it?

31:12.581 --> 31:14.833
Well, if the pressure isn't released,
it could kill him.

31:17.753 --> 31:19.671
Linbaba, the police are here
looking for you.

31:20.464 --> 31:21.965
Okay, Lin, you have to go.

31:21.965 --> 31:23.550
Let's hide you somewhere else.

31:26.428 --> 31:27.596
I can't leave him.

31:27.596 --> 31:31.141
We can take Qasim to his own hut.
Bring what you need and treat him there.

31:32.643 --> 31:35.437
Okay. Johnny, you help me with him.
Parvati, bring our supplies.

31:36.021 --> 31:39.399
Qasim, we need to move you, all right?
Gonna lift you up on three.

31:39.399 --> 31:41.360
One, two, three.

31:43.570 --> 31:44.696
Fuck.

31:44.696 --> 31:46.823
I will stay here
to slow down the cops. Go.

31:46.823 --> 31:49.952
Prabhu. No.
-Qasimbhai needs you both.

31:49.952 --> 31:51.370
I am not a doctor.

31:52.162 --> 31:53.830
But I can give you time.

32:15.352 --> 32:16.353
Who is it?

32:16.353 --> 32:17.437
Sebastian.

32:24.820 --> 32:25.821
Lisa.

32:33.036 --> 32:34.037
My love.

32:35.205 --> 32:37.207
Karla.
-Sebastian.

32:37.207 --> 32:39.501
It's not too late to go get Lin.

32:39.501 --> 32:42.504
Lin? Why would we take Lin?

32:42.504 --> 32:44.423
'Cause he got Maurizio off our backs.

32:45.299 --> 32:47.509
'Cause he loves Karla the way you love me.

32:47.509 --> 32:48.594
Don't.

32:48.594 --> 32:51.930
Karla, it's okay with me.
We have enough money to go around.

32:53.098 --> 32:54.224
Where is the money?

32:56.518 --> 32:58.061
I've hidden it somewhere safe.

33:00.564 --> 33:02.733
We'll pick it up on our way out of town.

33:09.156 --> 33:10.866
You've done this before?

33:10.866 --> 33:13.952
No. This is a surgeon's work.

33:14.786 --> 33:17.873
If we don't relieve the pressure,
he's gonna die, so we have to try.

33:25.589 --> 33:27.466
Okay, hold him tight.

33:31.011 --> 33:33.347
Hold tight. Hold him tight.

33:40.729 --> 33:42.648
I need the iodine and cotton.
-Oh.

33:47.027 --> 33:49.071
Okay. Okay. Good.

33:51.406 --> 33:52.616
Okay.

34:00.415 --> 34:02.626
We need to lift that section.

34:09.675 --> 34:10.926
Oh, fuck!
-Hey.

34:10.926 --> 34:12.094
Back.

34:17.558 --> 34:19.434
You're making a terrible mistake.

34:20.978 --> 34:21.978
Why?

34:22.980 --> 34:24.481
Because you work for Khader Khan?

34:26.817 --> 34:29.069
Well, you know he's probably dead by now?

34:29.735 --> 34:31.280
Because of a war you started.

34:32.030 --> 34:34.408
Madame Zhou wants to see you both.
-No fucking way.

34:36.076 --> 34:37.536
The bags, Modena. And you, Karla.

34:50.007 --> 34:51.466
Where is the money?

34:54.136 --> 34:55.846
The money. The money. The money!

34:55.846 --> 34:58.182
Where's the fucking money?
Tell me where it is, now!

34:58.182 --> 35:00.267
Maurizio, let them go
and I'll give you it.

35:01.393 --> 35:03.478
No.
-Uh-uh? Come here.

35:03.478 --> 35:05.606
No, no, no. No. Maurizio.
-No!

35:06.106 --> 35:07.649
Come here. Listen to me.

35:07.649 --> 35:10.152
If you don't tell me
what you have done with my money,

35:10.152 --> 35:11.778
I'm going to smash...
-No, no.

35:11.778 --> 35:15.657
...this pretty little face until she begs me
to shoot her. Do you understand?

35:16.491 --> 35:17.868
Enough. We need to go.

35:17.868 --> 35:19.620
Take them.
-No, no! Don't.

35:19.620 --> 35:20.913
Shh. Just tell me.
-No!

35:20.913 --> 35:22.623
Just tell me where it is.
-Maurizio.

35:22.623 --> 35:23.916
Tell me where my money is.

35:23.916 --> 35:25.709
Tell me. Tell me!

35:25.709 --> 35:27.127
No? No?
-No.

35:27.711 --> 35:29.546
No! No!

35:37.054 --> 35:38.889
Baby. Help him, please!

35:38.889 --> 35:42.559
Please, no. No, no, no.
-Come here.

35:42.559 --> 35:44.436
Help him, please.

35:45.020 --> 35:48.607
Just tell me where my money is, now. Now!
-She can't tell you, she doesn't know!

35:50.067 --> 35:51.193
No, no, no. No.

35:51.944 --> 35:53.028
Baby!

36:04.873 --> 36:06.667
There he is. That's him.

36:09.878 --> 36:11.421
Can I be helping you?

36:14.258 --> 36:16.510
Do you know the <i>gora</i> Lin Ford?

36:16.510 --> 36:18.720
He is my good friend.
That is his hut right there.

36:18.720 --> 36:21.515
He's in there?
-No, I'm saying this is his place,

36:21.515 --> 36:22.850
not that he is in it.

36:24.059 --> 36:25.477
Where's Dale Conti?

36:26.061 --> 36:30.858
Dale Conti. I am not knowing Dale Conti.
This is my very best friend, Linbaba.

36:32.234 --> 36:33.277
You're his best friend?

36:33.277 --> 36:36.697
Linbaba is being the doctor here,
taking very good care of all of us.

36:37.364 --> 36:39.950
He can be anywhere. Very hard to find.

36:39.950 --> 36:43.704
But, um, I am best at finding things.

36:43.704 --> 36:45.747
This little slum rat wants <i>baksheesh</i>.

36:50.377 --> 36:55.090
I know you like to do things right.
But Dale Conti killed another good cop.

36:55.090 --> 36:59.553
If we don't get him now, he's gone.
He's gone.

37:03.682 --> 37:05.559
I'll go supervise the search elsewhere.

37:09.062 --> 37:10.147
Okay.

37:19.990 --> 37:21.992
Move the light. I need more light.

37:26.663 --> 37:28.248
This is moment of truth.

37:35.464 --> 37:37.549
Okay. Okay.

37:41.178 --> 37:42.930
Where is the <i>gora</i>? Huh?

37:45.307 --> 37:47.601
Huh?
-I almost had it.

37:47.601 --> 37:49.061
And then you made me forget.

37:50.562 --> 37:52.231
Listen, listen, listen.

37:52.231 --> 37:54.608
Why are you bothering, Son? Why?

37:55.400 --> 37:58.403
You see that? That's the clot.
-Yes.

38:12.292 --> 38:14.503
All right. I need the saline.

38:23.637 --> 38:26.473
Tell me,
or I'm going to take your eyes. Huh?

38:33.564 --> 38:34.565
Okay.

38:37.401 --> 38:40.070
What is happening? Where is Uncle Qasim?

38:40.070 --> 38:41.655
He is being treated by Linbaba.

38:49.162 --> 38:51.790
You should leave. Go.

38:58.839 --> 39:00.132
Where is he?

39:01.008 --> 39:02.092
Huh?

39:07.514 --> 39:09.725
Nightingale. Out here now.

39:18.400 --> 39:21.695
What?
-I know where the <i>gora</i> is, saab.

39:21.695 --> 39:23.280
And what do you fucking want?

39:24.865 --> 39:26.200
I want him punished.

39:32.206 --> 39:33.957
Boy, let's go.

39:38.420 --> 39:39.505
Qasim.

39:40.631 --> 39:42.090
Qasim, can you hear me?

39:50.349 --> 39:51.517
Hey, hey.

39:51.517 --> 39:56.396
Hey. Hey, Qasim. Do you know who I am?

40:01.109 --> 40:03.237
The <i>gora</i> pain in the ass.

40:24.091 --> 40:25.175
Go find her.

40:25.175 --> 40:26.385
I'm not leaving you now.

40:26.385 --> 40:30.848
I have Ranveer and the others.
Walid took his shot at me and missed.

40:30.848 --> 40:33.600
The others weren't so lucky.
They're hitting us all over town.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.602
Go find Karla and bring her here!

40:35.602 --> 40:37.479
Karla is the cause of all of this.

40:38.772 --> 40:42.776
Karla made a mistake
and we love her still.

40:44.570 --> 40:45.571
Now go.

40:47.322 --> 40:48.699
How far is it?

40:49.408 --> 40:50.742
Linbaba.

40:52.870 --> 40:55.789
<i>In that moment,
my wishes and fears crashed together.</i>

40:55.789 --> 40:58.959
<i>And I knew the nightmare that was waiting
if Nightingale caught me.</i>

40:58.959 --> 41:00.085
Dale!

41:04.298 --> 41:06.091
Yes, you, motherfucker.

41:06.091 --> 41:07.092
Hey!

41:11.013 --> 41:12.514
Come on! Come on!

42:07.611 --> 42:09.112
There, there, there, there.

42:10.239 --> 42:11.406
Get in, Linbaba!

42:24.211 --> 42:26.547
I'll be expecting
very good tip for this, Linbaba.

42:26.547 --> 42:27.631
Very good, huh?
