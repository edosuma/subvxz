07:48.709 --> 07:51.500
it's a chick room.

07:51.542 --> 07:54.166
I'll just put these

07:51.542 --> 07:54.166
right here and shut the door.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.125
- [shrieking]

08:00.750 --> 08:03.959
- I have a vision

08:00.750 --> 08:03.959
for Dawn's empty space...

08:04.000 --> 08:07.417
And industrial-size

08:04.000 --> 08:07.417
pants press.

08:07.458 --> 08:12.834
Say goodbye to wrinkles

08:07.458 --> 08:12.834
and hello to success.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.709
- Or something real!

08:14.750 --> 08:17.250
Octopus hair stylist!

08:17.291 --> 08:19.125
With a blow dryer

08:17.291 --> 08:19.125
in every arm.

08:22.875 --> 08:26.417
- Think, Dicky.

08:22.875 --> 08:26.417
That's ridiculous.

08:26.458 --> 08:29.000
We don't have eight outlets.

08:29.041 --> 08:31.709
- Solar powered octopus hat.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.458
Problem.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.458
Solution.

08:37.500 --> 08:41.500
- While you guys bicker,

08:37.500 --> 08:41.500
I'm a man of action.

08:45.291 --> 08:48.375
It's meat o'clock, boys,

08:45.291 --> 08:48.375
and I'm buying.

08:50.041 --> 08:52.792
- It's weird, but I like it.

08:52.834 --> 08:54.375
I'll grab some plates.

08:54.417 --> 08:56.291
Who needs plates?

08:56.333 --> 08:57.875
We have hands!

09:00.709 --> 09:03.166
We should've replaced

09:00.709 --> 09:03.166
Dawn with meat years ago!

09:03.208 --> 09:04.583
- Uh-huh!

09:08.000 --> 09:11.083
- First night in my own room.

09:11.125 --> 09:13.083
With my Mommy

09:11.125 --> 09:13.083
right next to me.

09:13.125 --> 09:15.709
- Aloha.

09:15.750 --> 09:19.375
Did you know "aloha"

09:15.750 --> 09:19.375
also means "goodbye"?

09:19.417 --> 09:22.583
- Look at you,

09:19.417 --> 09:22.583
all grown-up and knowing stuff.

09:22.625 --> 09:24.083
You know what else I know?

09:24.125 --> 09:25.750
The boys want you to go

09:24.125 --> 09:25.750
and tuck them in.

09:25.792 --> 09:27.041
- No way!

09:27.083 --> 09:28.750
This is our special

09:27.083 --> 09:28.750
girl time!

09:28.792 --> 09:32.000
It's time to dish.

09:28.792 --> 09:32.000
I'm sure the boys are fine.

09:32.041 --> 09:35.333
- [all groaning]

09:35.375 --> 09:38.834
- I can't believe we ate

09:35.375 --> 09:38.834
the whole thing.

09:38.875 --> 09:40.834
- [sniffs]

09:40.875 --> 09:43.208
My sweat

09:40.875 --> 09:43.208
smells like gravy.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.583
- My stomach kept saying

09:44.792 --> 09:47.583
"Stop,"

09:47.625 --> 09:51.250
but the meat kept saying "Go!"

09:51.291 --> 09:54.083
[all groan]

09:54.125 --> 09:55.792
- Ooh, I just thought

09:54.125 --> 09:55.792
of another secret!

09:55.834 --> 09:58.458
Okay. I used to have

09:55.834 --> 09:58.458
this John Stamos pillowcase

09:58.500 --> 10:01.291
and I would snuggle

09:58.500 --> 10:01.291
with him, like, every night.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.000
I'd be all, "Sweet dreams,

10:01.333 --> 10:04.000
Uncle Jesse."

10:04.041 --> 10:05.709
and then I would--

10:05.750 --> 10:07.041
- Okay, that sounds like

10:07.083 --> 10:08.875
a "night two" kind of secret.

10:08.917 --> 10:10.250
- All right, you're right.

10:10.291 --> 10:11.959
We'll save it

10:10.291 --> 10:11.959
for tomorrow night.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
Aw. My little girl

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
isn't so little anymore.

10:16.542 --> 10:18.917
Sweet dreams.

10:18.959 --> 10:21.083
- Thanks again, Mom.

10:18.959 --> 10:21.083
I love my new room.

10:21.125 --> 10:23.959
- Me too.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.875
- Finally.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.875
No annoying brothers,

10:27.917 --> 10:32.041
no over-sharing mother, just

10:27.917 --> 10:32.041
me and you, Sprinkles' neck.

10:32.083 --> 10:33.917
Alone in my own room.

10:39.041 --> 10:42.375
I didn't think

10:39.041 --> 10:42.375
it would be this quiet.

10:42.417 --> 10:44.583
Or dark.

10:44.625 --> 10:49.250
[wood creaking]

10:44.625 --> 10:49.250
[wind whistling]

10:49.291 --> 10:51.208
- Or shadowy.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.417
Be glad you don't have any eyes,

10:51.250 --> 10:53.417
Sprinkles' neck.

10:54.625 --> 10:58.166
[squeaking]

10:54.625 --> 10:58.166
Or anything to pee out of.

11:00.083 --> 11:03.083
Ooh! Okay, don't freak out.

11:03.125 --> 11:05.875
Princess Giggles!

11:05.917 --> 11:08.458
Maybe your laughter

11:05.917 --> 11:08.458
will help us feel better.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.166
[doll giggling]

11:11.208 --> 11:13.917
[sinister laughter]

11:23.875 --> 11:25.875
[alarm clock ringing]

11:23.875 --> 11:25.875
- [screams]

11:28.208 --> 11:30.917
- Oh, it's morning.

11:30.959 --> 11:34.250
We made it! We made it,

11:30.959 --> 11:34.250
Sprinkles' neck.

11:34.291 --> 11:36.041
<i>- Kids! Breakfast!</i>

11:39.709 --> 11:42.834
Tom, you're a grown man

11:39.709 --> 11:42.834
playing with children's toys,

11:42.875 --> 11:44.917
sitting crisscross

11:42.875 --> 11:44.917
applesauce in the middle

11:44.959 --> 11:47.125
of our kitchen.

11:44.959 --> 11:47.125
It's absurd.

11:47.166 --> 11:49.250
- Well, you wouldn't

11:47.166 --> 11:49.250
think it was absurd

11:49.291 --> 11:51.041
if you watched the complex

11:49.291 --> 11:51.041
ways

11:51.083 --> 11:52.500
in which the trains interact

11:51.083 --> 11:52.500
with their environment

11:52.542 --> 11:53.750
and each other.

11:53.792 --> 11:55.917
It's an art form really.

11:55.959 --> 11:58.375
Observe.

11:58.417 --> 12:00.458
Good morning, Dr. Caboose.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.041
Well, good morrow to you,

12:02.083 --> 12:04.583
colonel Front-Of-The-Train.

12:04.625 --> 12:06.625
Going to fill up at the mill?

12:06.667 --> 12:10.250
Why yes. Care to join me?

12:10.291 --> 12:12.208
All aboard!

12:14.000 --> 12:16.208
[blows whistle]

12:19.625 --> 12:20.792
See?

12:22.875 --> 12:25.625
- Tom, I'm gonna be

12:22.875 --> 12:25.625
very clear about this.

12:25.667 --> 12:28.375
I have never been

12:25.667 --> 12:28.375
less attracted to you.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.667
- Got it. I'll just

12:30.500 --> 12:33.667
pack these up

12:33.709 --> 12:36.125
and donate

12:33.709 --> 12:36.125
them to the trainless.

12:41.542 --> 12:44.250
- Dawn?

12:41.542 --> 12:44.250
- I love my room!

12:44.291 --> 12:46.625
- Yeah, yeah, rub it in.

12:46.667 --> 12:49.792
- Hey, honey, how was your

12:46.667 --> 12:49.792
first night in your new room?

12:49.834 --> 12:51.542
Mom, I'm going to be

12:49.834 --> 12:51.542
totally honest.

12:51.583 --> 12:53.458
The thing is, I--

12:53.500 --> 12:56.083
I should've moved

12:53.500 --> 12:56.083
into my new room years ago!

12:56.125 --> 12:58.583
What's up,

12:56.125 --> 12:58.583
former roommates?

12:58.625 --> 13:01.917
You mean "room-meats."

13:01.959 --> 13:04.333
[all laughing]

13:04.375 --> 13:06.000
I--I don't get it.

13:06.041 --> 13:08.500
- You wouldn't.

13:06.041 --> 13:08.500
It's an inside joke.

13:08.542 --> 13:11.792
As in inside our room

13:08.542 --> 13:11.792
that you no longer sleep in!

13:11.834 --> 13:13.667
- Whoo!

13:11.834 --> 13:13.667
- Boom!

13:13.709 --> 13:15.458
Both: Ha!

13:15.500 --> 13:18.875
- Oh, well, my room's

13:15.500 --> 13:18.875
got jokes, too.

13:18.917 --> 13:21.333
Knock-knock, who's there?

13:18.917 --> 13:21.333
Not you!

13:21.375 --> 13:23.166
What! Hoo!

13:31.709 --> 13:32.917
- Are you okay?

13:32.959 --> 13:35.417
- [yawning]

13:32.959 --> 13:35.417
I'm fine, why?

13:35.458 --> 13:38.625
- Because when you're tired,

13:35.458 --> 13:38.625
you imagine your dog can talk.

13:38.667 --> 13:41.000
By the way, you know what

13:38.667 --> 13:41.000
would be a good smoothie flavor?

13:41.041 --> 13:42.667
Dog butt.

13:42.709 --> 13:43.750
[sneezes]

13:43.792 --> 13:45.750
- I love my room!

13:45.792 --> 13:48.166
- Dawn, what's going on

13:45.792 --> 13:48.166
with you?

13:48.208 --> 13:50.375
- You know my new room

13:48.208 --> 13:50.375
that I love so much?

13:50.417 --> 13:53.250
- Yeah.

13:50.417 --> 13:53.250
- I hate it!

13:53.291 --> 13:55.417
It's dark

13:53.291 --> 13:55.417
and shadowy

13:55.458 --> 13:57.875
and that doll's freakin'

13:55.458 --> 13:57.875
me out, Mae.

13:57.917 --> 14:01.583
[boys chattering, laughing]

14:04.458 --> 14:07.709
- Plus, now my brothers have

14:04.458 --> 14:07.709
all these inside jokes.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.834
What's "room meat," Mae?

14:09.875 --> 14:11.375
[whispering]

14:09.875 --> 14:11.375
What is "room meat?"

14:16.041 --> 14:18.792
- Look, Dawn,

14:16.041 --> 14:18.792
if you're this unhappy,

14:18.834 --> 14:20.583
just move back in with them.

14:20.625 --> 14:23.959
- No way, if I move back in,

14:20.625 --> 14:23.959
it's admitting defeat.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.166
They said I couldn't

14:24.000 --> 14:27.166
make it without them.

14:27.208 --> 14:28.500
Quick. They're looking at us.

14:28.542 --> 14:30.000
Pretend we're having fun.

14:30.041 --> 14:32.625
[girls laugh loudly]

14:30.041 --> 14:32.625
- Oh, my...

14:32.667 --> 14:34.333
- Wow!

14:34.375 --> 14:37.000
- Wow! Dawn seems happy.

14:37.041 --> 14:39.500
- She's supposed to be

14:37.041 --> 14:39.500
miserable without us.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.667
- I mean, we're happy

14:39.542 --> 14:41.667
without her,

14:41.709 --> 14:45.291
but we're not that happy.

14:41.709 --> 14:45.291
Are we?

14:45.333 --> 14:46.667
- Of course we are.

14:46.709 --> 14:48.875
Remember "room meats"?

14:48.917 --> 14:50.166
- Eh.

14:50.208 --> 14:51.667
- It's getting a little old.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.792
- Maybe she doesn't need us.

14:56.834 --> 14:59.125
- Well, we don't need her.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.375
Quick, pretend we're

14:59.166 --> 15:01.375
happier than she is.

15:01.417 --> 15:06.291
[boys laughing loudly]

15:06.333 --> 15:08.041
- Oh, that's so funny!

15:17.000 --> 15:19.709
- Here we are.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.709
Back again.

15:21.125 --> 15:24.792
Creepy tree,

15:24.834 --> 15:26.625
creepy doll.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.250
I can do this.

15:30.291 --> 15:33.917
I'll show those boys who's

15:30.291 --> 15:33.917
strong enough to live alone.

15:33.959 --> 15:36.333
- Good night, honey.

15:33.959 --> 15:36.333
- Mommy! Come on in!

15:38.291 --> 15:39.667
- Are you ready

15:38.291 --> 15:39.667
for night number two?

15:39.709 --> 15:42.000
- Not without some girl chat.

15:42.041 --> 15:45.709
So tell me about this Dad guy

15:42.041 --> 15:45.709
you have a crush on.

15:45.750 --> 15:47.417
- That's really sweet,

15:45.750 --> 15:47.417
but I know you're not

15:47.458 --> 15:49.959
really that interested,

15:47.458 --> 15:49.959
so, good night!

15:50.000 --> 15:52.375
- Wait! You never

15:50.000 --> 15:52.375
finished telling me

15:52.417 --> 15:55.959
about you

15:52.417 --> 15:55.959
and Uncle Jesse pillow.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.667
- You know, I know

15:56.000 --> 15:57.667
what's going on here.

15:57.709 --> 15:59.417
- Oh, I'm so glad.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.583
- You need your space

15:59.458 --> 16:01.583
and you want me out of here.

16:01.625 --> 16:03.125
[smooches]

16:01.625 --> 16:03.125
Good night!

16:03.166 --> 16:05.417
Oh! Aloha!

16:08.542 --> 16:09.792
- [squeaky] I'm scared.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.875
- [pounding]

16:13.917 --> 16:16.291
That's good.

16:13.917 --> 16:16.291
Creepy ceiling noises

16:16.333 --> 16:20.125
are distracting me

16:16.333 --> 16:20.125
from the other creepy things.

16:20.166 --> 16:22.375
And they're getting louder.

16:22.417 --> 16:24.250
And closer.

16:24.291 --> 16:26.625
Come on, Sprinkles' neck!

16:24.291 --> 16:26.625
Run!

16:31.709 --> 16:34.000
- [pounding gets louder]

16:34.041 --> 16:35.500
- [screams, groans]

16:35.542 --> 16:37.291
- [screaming]

16:37.333 --> 16:38.875
- It's me! It's me!

16:40.333 --> 16:41.542
- Dad?

16:41.583 --> 16:43.417
Sorry, you scared me.

16:43.458 --> 16:45.875
What were you doing up there?

16:45.917 --> 16:47.208
- The--
