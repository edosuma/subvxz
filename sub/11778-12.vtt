AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME,

17:49.818 --> 17:51.987
EVEN A MINOR SLIPUP COULD
DEFINITELY SEND YOU PACKING.

17:52.070 --> 17:54.782
- PULLING OUT THE TRICKS.
- I HAVE TO.

17:54.865 --> 17:55.949
THERE'S THREE SPOTS, I WANT
TO MAKE SURE I GET ONE OF 'EM.

17:56.033 --> 17:59.161
- JIME IS, OF COURSE,
DOING NEW SCHOOL.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.497

HE CAN DO IN HIS SLEEP.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.456

IN THIS COMPETITION.

SCREW HIM UP TODAY.

THE FINALE?

DO SOMETHING AMAZING.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.700
SHE'S GOING INTO THIS
LAST TATTOO WITH A DEFICIT.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.202
IF KYLE DOES A DECENT TATTOO,

18:40.285 --> 18:41.745
HE COULD RUN AWAY WITH IT.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.209

KEEPS GETTING REDDER AND REDDER.

{\an8}HIS SKIN SEEMS TO BE TAKING LESS
OF THE INK,

18:56.009 --> 18:57.719
{\an8}AND I HAVE TO MAKE
DARKER CHOICES HERE.

FOR SURE, IS KYLE.

{\an8}HIS DESIGN IS VERY HARD TO READ,

19:07.312 --> 19:09.398
{\an8}AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE
IS ENVISIONING IN HIS HEAD,

19:09.481 --> 19:14.653

HOW HE TRIES TO PULL IT OFF.

{\an8}I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
AS MUCH DONE AS POSSIBLE,

19:24.371 --> 19:25.914
{\an8}AND THEN HOPEFULLY HAVE TIME
TO GO BACK IN AND ADD

19:25.998 --> 19:27.332
{\an8}THE DETAILS THAT I WANT TO ADD.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.626

YOU GOT COREY MILLER'S DESIGN
FOR THE FOUR-IN-ONE TATTOO.

22:14.249 --> 22:15.459
- THE MAIN THING I WANTED
TO SEE FROM THIS IS

22:15.542 --> 22:17.252
A GOOD USE OF BACKGROUND WORK
DOESN'T OVERCOME THE IMAGE.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.172
WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT IT IS
YOU WENT SO DARK

22:26.136 --> 22:27.596
ONE CLOUD THAT'S BARELY EVEN
IN THERE.

THE SAME TONES ON THE INSIDE

22:29.973 --> 22:31.641
OF THE MOUTH AND THE OUTSIDE
OF THE CLOUD.

TO PUT STUFF TOGETHER,

TIGER DONE OVER AND OVER.

YOU DID THE DETAILS IN IT.

TO FIGHT TO STAY.

FLOATING UP,

24:38.435 --> 24:39.853

OF REALM

AND I'M RIGHT UP ON IT,

24:48.445 --> 24:51.615
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIGURE
OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON.

24:51.698 --> 24:53.742
- I WANTED TO DESTROY THOUGHTS
AND CONCEPTS

24:53.825 --> 24:54.743
OF WHAT IMAGES
SHOULD LOOK LIKE.

24:54.826 --> 24:58.205

24:59.331 --> 25:02.209
AND THAT'S ALL FINE AND GOOD,

25:02.292 --> 25:05.921
BUT TODAY, YOU NEEDED TO DO
SOMETHING THAT WAS CLEAR.

25:06.004 --> 25:09.007
THE TEXTURE IN THE WHOLE TATTOO
LOOKS THE SAME.

25:09.090 --> 25:10.884
THERE'S A LOT
OF UNSURE ELEMENTS.

25:10.967 --> 25:12.928
- DECISIONS YOU MADE
IN THIS TATTOO?

25:13.011 --> 25:14.721
VERY RISKY DECISIONS.
THAT'S THE CHANCE YOU TOOK.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.101
- TATU BABY.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.855
WHEN YOU WERE HANDED THIS
DESIGN, HOW DID YOU FEEL?

25:23.939 --> 25:25.649
- WELL, IF PEOPLE GIVE YOU
THE HARDEST CHALLENGE,

25:25.732 --> 25:27.567
IT'S BECAUSE
THEY BELIEVE IN YOU.

25:27.651 --> 25:30.278
MY ONLY CHALLENGE WITH THIS
WAS DOING IT IN THREE HOURS.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.988
- TECHNICALLY SPEAKING,
ON THIS TATTOO,

25:32.072 --> 25:33.531
THE FLAMES ARE NICE
AND SATURATED.

25:33.615 --> 25:34.699
THE WAY YOU COLORED
THE FACE, GREAT.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.618
THE LINE WORK, YOU DID BETTER
THAN YOU'VE DONE BEFORE,

25:36.701 --> 25:39.829
BUT LEARNING TO BE EFFICIENT
WITH THAT OUTLINE,

25:39.913 --> 25:41.206

THIS THING OUT.

25:41.289 --> 25:43.625

BUT I HAD TO DO ALL THOSE LINES

25:43.708 --> 25:45.418
IN THREE HOURS, AND SHADE IT,
AND COLOR IT.

25:45.502 --> 25:48.463

26:05.021 --> 26:06.481
- NO, NO, NO!
I'M TALKIN' SEVEN YEARS.

26:06.564 --> 26:08.650
SEVEN YEARS OF TATTOOING.
- OH, NOBODY.

26:08.733 --> 26:09.442
- WHO'S YELLING AT YOU WHEN
YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG?

26:09.526 --> 26:11.236
- NOBODY.
- THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

26:11.319 --> 26:12.445
YOU CAN GET BETTER.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.823
WHAT JOB CAN YOU
DO SOMETHING WRONG

26:14.906 --> 26:18.326
EVERY DAY FOR SEVEN YEARS,
AND STILL HAVE YOUR JOB?

26:19.744 --> 26:22.497
- LET'S TALK ABOUT
YOUR ARTIST'S CHOICE DESIGN.

26:22.580 --> 26:25.250
- THIS IS A GOOD REPRESENTATION
FOR YOU TO FOLLOW UP,

26:25.333 --> 26:26.167
TAKING A PUNCH.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.211
- THIS IS A REALLY SOLID,
STRONG TATTOO.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.839
- CHOOSING TRADITIONAL TATTOO
IMAGERY OF SKULLS AND ROSES

26:30.922 --> 26:33.049
IS VERY SMART.
WHEN IT COMES TO TATTOOS

26:33.133 --> 26:34.426
LIKE THIS, YOU HAVE
VERY STRONG LINE WORK.

26:34.509 --> 26:36.803
THE WAY YOU SATURATE THAT BLACK,

26:36.886 --> 26:38.430
AND BLEND IT OUT SOFTLY
THROUGH COLORS

26:38.513 --> 26:39.306
IS SOME OF THE BEST
IN THE ROOM.

26:39.389 --> 26:41.558
- IF YOU CAN DO THIS,
YOU NEED

26:41.641 --> 26:43.143
TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE
YOU ACCOMPLISH TO DO IT

26:43.226 --> 26:45.687
EVERY SINGLE TATTOO.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.817
- OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE A HUGE
DECISION AHEAD OF US.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.153
THREE OF YOU WILL EARN
THE OPPORTUNITY TO BATTLE IT OUT

26:53.236 --> 26:55.488
IN THE LIVE FINALE,

26:55.572 --> 26:57.490
AND ONE OF YOU WILL PACK
YOUR MACHINES.

26:57.574 --> 27:00.452
- THIS IS GONNA BE
A SERIOUS DELIBERATION.

27:00.535 --> 27:01.661
I MEAN, IT'S DOWN TO THE WIRE,

27:01.745 --> 27:03.121
AND HONESTLY,
IT'S A PRETTY TIGHT RACE.

27:03.204 --> 27:05.498
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,

27:05.582 --> 27:08.084
AND WE'LL CALL YOU BACK WHEN
WE HAVE A DECISION.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.552
{\an8}- TATU BABY DROPPED
THE BALL ON IT.

27:17.635 --> 27:19.471
{\an8}- AND I CAN STAND STRONGER
THAN KYLE.

27:19.554 --> 27:20.680
- GOING INTO THE LIVE FINALE,

27:20.764 --> 27:21.681
IT'S A BATTLE THAT I REALLY WANT
TO RISE TO.

27:21.765 --> 27:23.808
- I HAVE THE FIGHT
TO DO A GRADE "A" TATTOO.

"OH, I COULD PROBABLY HAVE
FINISHED IT,"

27:34.235 --> 27:36.279
I THINK HE KNOWS THE DIFFICULTY
THAT WAS THAT TASK.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.490

I THINK YOU OVERTHINK IT,
AND IT TAKES YOU LONGER.

27:40.825 --> 27:42.243

- RIGHT.

BETWEEN KYLE AND TATU BABY,

I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SHOW
A RECORD THAT REALLY

28:14.526 --> 28:15.151
DESERVES TO STAND UP
AT THAT PODIUM.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.237
- BUT CONSISTENTLY,

28:17.320 --> 28:18.696
DAY IN AND DAY OUT,
YOU DID BETTER THAN HER.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.782
YOU DESERVE THE SPOT
EVEN MORE.

28:20.865 --> 28:22.117
YOU MAY NOT THINK THAT, BUT--

28:22.200 --> 28:23.451
- THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR, REALLY,
THAT GOES INTO IT.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.786
- YOU WEREN'T AT THE BOTTOM.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.913
THEY DIDN'T SAY YOUR TATTOO
LOOKED LIKE [bleep].

28:26.996 --> 28:29.082
MULTIPLE TIMES THEY SAID
HER TATTOO LOOKED LIKE [bleep].

28:29.165 --> 28:31.167
- RIGHT ON.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.002
- SO I WOULD BE PISSED OFF
IF I WAS YOU,

28:33.086 --> 28:34.838
AND I WASN'T THE ONE MAKING
THE THIRD SPOT,

28:34.921 --> 28:36.881
BECAUSE YOU DESERVE IT.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.468

THIS IS IT.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.138
THE FOUR-ON-ONE TATTOO,
THE ARTIST'S CHOICE TATTOO.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.932
ONE OF THESE ARTISTS IS GOING
TO WALK AWAY WITH 100 GRAND.

28:46.015 --> 28:49.644
- I THINK, MORE IMPORTANTLY,
ONE OF THEM IS JUST GOING HOME

28:49.727 --> 28:50.854
AND NOT GET A CHANCE FOR
THE 100 GRAND.

28:50.937 --> 28:54.816
- I THINK IT'S PRETTY SAFE
TO SAY THAT JIME AND JOEY,

28:54.899 --> 28:56.818
MORE THAN LIKELY,
ARE GONNA GO TO THE FINAL THREE.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.153
- THEY'RE IN THE SAFE SEATS.

28:58.236 --> 29:00.196
- JIME GOT
THE CHUEY QUINTANAR DESIGN.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.031
- I WANTED TO SEE HIM STEP ASIDE

29:02.115 --> 29:04.159
FROM HIS NEW SCHOOL STYLE
OF TATTOO,

29:04.242 --> 29:06.369
AND PULL IT OFF THE WAY THIS
STYLE OF TATTOO SHOULD LOOK,

29:06.453 --> 29:07.662
AND HE ACED IT.
- YEAH.

29:07.745 --> 29:08.830
LET'S MOVE TO HIS ARTIST'S
CHOICE CANVAS.

29:08.913 --> 29:12.333
- HE REALLY PUT EFFORT
AND THOUGHT INTO THE DESIGN,

29:12.417 --> 29:13.918
AND THE ANATOMY IS PERFECT.

29:14.002 --> 29:17.672
- LET'S MOVE ALONG
TO JOEY'S COREY MILLER DRAGON.

29:17.755 --> 29:19.257
- NO REAL "WOW" FACTOR.

29:19.340 --> 29:22.218
FOR JOEY TO NOT
BE ABLE TO SEPARATE

29:22.302 --> 29:24.888
FOREGROUND AND BACKGROUND,
IT'S JUST FLAT TO ME.

29:24.971 --> 29:26.723
- OKAY, WELL, LET'S MOVE
TO HIS BLANK CANVAS.

29:26.806 --> 29:27.765
- IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

29:27.849 --> 29:28.850
IT'S GOT ALL THESE
AMAZING DETAILS.

29:28.933 --> 29:31.436
IT'S GOT ALL THAT "WOW" FACTOR.
IT STANDS OUT.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.188
- WHO ARE WE GONNA SEND HOME?

29:33.271 --> 29:34.689
IT'S A HEAVY DECISION
TO BE MADE.

29:34.772 --> 29:37.442
TATU BABY, UP AND DOWN,
UP AND DOWN ALL SEASON.

29:37.525 --> 29:39.027
HOW MUCH IS TATU BABY'S
INABILITY

29:39.110 --> 29:41.613
TO FINISH HER FUDO DESIGN
GOING TO HURT HER?

29:41.696 --> 29:42.780
- IF SHE WOULD HAVE DONE
NO COLORS,

29:42.864 --> 29:45.033
BUT THE OUTLINE WAS IMMACULATE
AND PERFECT,

29:45.116 --> 29:48.453
SHE WOULD HAVE AT LEAST HIT THE
CHALLENGE WE WERE GIVING HER.

29:48.536 --> 29:49.412
LOOK IN THE HAIR.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.498
NO TWO LINES REALLY HAVE
THE SAME WEIGHT,

29:51.581 --> 29:53.791
AND YOU SEE THAT ALL OVER
THE PLACE.

29:53.875 --> 29:54.876
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S MOVE
INTO HER ARTIST'S CHOICE.

29:54.959 --> 29:58.880
SHE SHOWED DIMENSION, A NUMBER
OF DIFFERENT TEXTURES.

29:58.963 --> 30:00.048
- I THINK IT'S
A VERY BEAUTIFUL TATTOO.

30:00.131 --> 30:01.883
I REALLY LOVE
THE UNDERSHADOW.

30:01.966 --> 30:03.218
I REALLY LOVE HER USE OF BLACK.

30:03.301 --> 30:06.387
- SHE'S GOT HER MOMENTS,
AND IT'S CLEAR.

30:06.471 --> 30:07.680
- LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION ABOUT KYLE.

30:07.764 --> 30:10.016
HE'S BEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE ROAD THE WHOLE COMPETITION.

30:10.099 --> 30:11.935
YOU GUYS ASSIGNED HIM
THE AMERICAN TRADITIONAL.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.561
- I WANTED TO SEE HIM
DO SOMETHING SIMPLE,

30:13.645 --> 30:15.146
BUT I WANTED
TO SEE SOMETHING SOLID,

30:15.230 --> 30:16.648
AND I THINK HE KILLED IT, MAN.

30:16.731 --> 30:18.566
- IT'S ONE OF THE BETTER TATTOOS
WE'VE SEEN OUT OF HIM.

30:18.650 --> 30:20.401
- IT WAS A STRONG DESIGN
THAT GOT HIM THERE,

30:20.485 --> 30:22.237
BUT WHEN THE DESIGNING'S
LEFT UP TO HIM,

30:22.320 --> 30:24.697
WE FIND THAT HE'S WEAK
IN HIS DESIGNS.

30:24.781 --> 30:26.574
- THIS IS A CONFUSING TATTOO.

30:26.658 --> 30:27.909
HE LOST HIS MAIN IMAGES
IN THE CONFUSING MESS.

30:27.992 --> 30:31.287
I JUST DON'T THINK TODAY
IS THE DAY FOR EXPERIMENTS.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.747
- WHO'S GONNA GO
TO THE LIVE FINALE?

30:32.830 --> 30:35.458
- GOING INTO THIS
LAST CHALLENGE,

30:35.542 --> 30:37.001
IT COULD'VE BEEN ANYONE.
- THIS IS IT.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.545
ARE WE IN AGREEMENT?
- I'M IN AGREEMENT.

30:38.628 --> 30:40.046
- YOU'RE GOOD?

30:40.129 --> 30:42.131
WANT TO GO GET 'EM?

30:42.215 --> 30:44.259

30:50.598 --> 30:52.058
LET'S ALL GO DOWN TO THE SHOP.

WE'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOIN' ON.

30:54.185 --> 30:54.811
- JESUS.
- I DON'T ABOUT YOU GUYS,

30:54.894 --> 30:56.563
BUT I'M STILL PRETTY NERVOUS.

30:56.646 --> 30:58.314
- YEAH, I'M NERVOUS.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.984
- THERE'S A LUMP THAT'S IN
MY THROAT, SWEATY PALMS.

31:01.067 --> 31:03.653
- YOU GUYS READY?

31:11.035 --> 31:15.206
- TODAY, WE GAVE YOU AN EPIC
CHALLENGE TO PROVE THAT

31:15.290 --> 31:19.627
YOU DESERVE TO COMPETE IN
THE LIVE FINALE FOR $100,000.

31:19.711 --> 31:24.090
BASED ON YOUR TATTOOS,
ONE OF YOU IS GOING HOME.

AND YOUR NEW SCHOOL STYLE,

31:44.485 --> 31:46.487

YOU ARE VERSATILE.

31:46.571 --> 31:47.822

31:47.905 --> 31:51.367
THIS MEANS THAT YOU HAVE SECURED
YOUR SPOT IN THE LIVE FINALE.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.786
- I WON'T LET YOU GUYS DOWN.
I PROMISE, I'M GONNA BRING IT.

31:53.870 --> 31:56.664
- JOEY.
- YOUR FIRST TATTOO

31:56.748 --> 31:58.541
DEFINITELY HAD SOME CRITIQUES
IN THERE,

31:58.625 --> 31:59.667
BUT IT WAS STILL SOLID.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.002
FOR YOUR ARTIST'S CHOICE
TATTOO,

32:01.085 --> 32:04.088
YOU DID A HUGE, FANCY TATTOO,

IN THE LIVE FINALE.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.563
TATU BABY.

32:20.647 --> 32:21.481
- IT'S SHOCKING TO ME THAT

32:21.564 --> 32:23.066
YOU'RE NOT CLEARLY
IN THE TOP THREE.

32:23.149 --> 32:26.694
YOU'VE HAD A LOT OF PEAKS
AND VALLEYS IN THIS COMPETITION.

32:26.778 --> 32:27.779
IF YOU GET THE CHANCE
TO STAY HERE,

32:27.862 --> 32:29.614
WE DON'T WANT TO BE LET DOWN.

32:29.697 --> 32:31.908
- I'VE HAD MY BUMPS IN THE ROAD,

32:31.991 --> 32:32.575
BUT I LEARNED FROM IT,
AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

32:32.659 --> 32:34.202
COME BACK [bleep] STRONG."

32:34.285 --> 32:37.872
AND IF I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO GO TO THE FINALS,

32:37.955 --> 32:40.291
I'M GONNA DO A [bleep]
GRADE "A" TATTOO.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.292
I HAVE THE FIGHT.

32:41.376 --> 32:43.252
I HAVE THE DETERMINATION
TO DO IT.

32:43.336 --> 32:46.339

TAKE YOUR SPOT

IT WAS VERY CLOSE THEN,
AND IT'S VERY CLOSE NOW.

32:52.095 --> 32:54.222
- KYLE.
- THE FACT THAT YOU COME IN HERE

32:54.305 --> 32:56.891
AS AN ARTIST, AND YOU RISK
AND YOU EXPERIMENT WITH THINGS.

32:56.974 --> 32:58.685
I MEAN, THAT'S REALLY INSPIRING.

32:58.768 --> 33:00.687
IN THE FIRST CHALLENGE THAT
WE ASSIGNED YOU,

33:00.770 --> 33:03.314
THIS IS A VERY NICE TATTOO,
AND YOU DEFINITELY HAD A LEG UP,

33:03.398 --> 33:05.608
BUT IN THE FINAL TATTOO,
YOU MADE SOME AWKWARD DECISIONS,

33:05.692 --> 33:07.985
AND WENT A LITTLE OVERBOARD.

33:08.069 --> 33:11.572
- MY LAST TATTOO WAS NOT
SPECTACULAR, I CAN'T DISAGREE,

33:11.656 --> 33:13.449
BUT GOING INTO
THE LIVE FINALE AGAINST

33:13.533 --> 33:15.118
TWO REALLY STRONG COMPETITORS,

33:15.201 --> 33:17.203
IT'S A BATTLE THAT
I REALLY WANT TO RISE TO.

33:19.664 --> 33:23.084
- TATU BABY, KYLE...

33:23.167 --> 33:26.546
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED...

33:36.806 --> 33:40.435
- TATU BABY AND KYLE,
ONE OF YOU

33:40.518 --> 33:42.729
WILL NOT BE COMPETING
IN THE LIVE FINALE.

33:45.064 --> 33:47.567
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.490
TATU BABY...

33:57.952 --> 34:00.913
YOU ARE HEADED TO THE FINALE.

34:00.997 --> 34:04.500
- WHAT?
- CONGRATULATIONS.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.586
- THIS WAS A REALLY
TOUGH DECISION FOR US.

34:06.669 --> 34:07.837
I WANT TO REALLY SEE YOU
DO SOMETHING AMAZING.

34:07.920 --> 34:10.922
GIVE THESE GUYS
A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY.

34:11.007 --> 34:14.594
- KYLE, YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT
IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

34:14.677 --> 34:17.263
- KYLE, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

34:17.346 --> 34:20.558
IN THIS COMPETITION, HAVING
DIFFERENT DECISIONS BEEN MADE,

34:20.641 --> 34:22.643
YOU QUITE POSSIBLY COULD
HAVE TAKEN THAT SPOT.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.437
IT WAS CLOSE.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.980
- KYLE, BEFORE YOU PACK
YOUR MACHINES,

34:26.063 --> 34:28.149
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

34:28.232 --> 34:31.110
ALL OF THE ELIMINATED ARTISTS
FROM THIS SEASON,

34:31.194 --> 34:33.529
INCLUDING YOU,
WILL HAVE A SECOND CHANCE

34:33.612 --> 34:35.697

OF "INK MASTER."

AN AMOUNT OF SHAME

35:07.105 --> 35:08.189
{\an8}INVOLVED WITH GOING HOME NOW,

35:13.945 --> 35:16.239

ALL THAT IS LEADING UP TO THIS.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.997
IT'S HARD FOR ME

{\an8}- THESE FINAL THREE PEOPLE
HAVE BATTLED IT OUT THROUGH

38:11.080 --> 38:13.666
{\an8}SO MANY DIFFERENT
CRAZY SITUATIONS,

38:13.749 --> 38:17.378
{\an8}AND NOW TO BE HERE AT THE END
AND GET THIS MASTER CANVAS?

38:17.461 --> 38:20.464
THERE COULDN'T BE
ANY HIGHER STAKES.

38:20.548 --> 38:21.924
THIS IS IT.

38:22.008 --> 38:25.011
THIS ONE TATTOO IS EVERYTHING
ON THE LINE.

38:25.094 --> 38:26.679
- ALL RIGHT,
SO FIRST AND FOREMOST,

38:26.762 --> 38:28.597
ARE YOU TATTOOED NOW?
- YES.

38:28.681 --> 38:29.765
- WHERE DO YOU HAVE TATTOOS AT?

38:29.849 --> 38:31.350
- UH, YOU WANT ME TO--

38:31.434 --> 38:33.019
I'M HERE TO WIN.

38:33.102 --> 38:34.020
OH, [bleep].

38:34.103 --> 38:35.312
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT
YOUR BACK DONE.

38:35.396 --> 38:37.565
NOBODY IN THIS COMPETITION
IS DOING WHAT I'M DOING.

38:37.648 --> 38:39.567
SINCE I GOT ACCEPTED
TO BE ON THIS SHOW,

38:39.650 --> 38:42.111
THE IDEA THAT I'VE HAD
IN MY MIND FOR THE WHOLE TIME

38:42.194 --> 38:43.904
IS CALLED, "THE BATTLE ROYALE."
- OKAY.

38:43.988 --> 38:46.115
- AND IT'S KIND OF FITTING
FOR THIS COMPETITION,

38:46.198 --> 38:48.117
BECAUSE THERE'S THREE PEOPLE
COMPETING FOR $100,000.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.827
- RIGHT.
- AND IN THE BATTLE ROYALE,

38:49.910 --> 38:51.912
IT'S BASICALLY AN EAGLE,
A DRAGON, AND A SNAKE,

38:51.996 --> 38:53.080
ALL FIGHTING EACH OTHER.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.749
- I LOVE IT.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.043
- I'D MUCH RATHER NOT DO
YOUR WHOLE BACK,

38:57.126 --> 38:58.127
AND BE RUSHING 35 HOURS.

38:58.210 --> 38:59.587
- YEAH.
- MY GAME PLAN IS

38:59.670 --> 39:02.423
TO DO SOMETHING SMALLER,
AND SPEND EVERY MINUTE OF THOSE

39:02.506 --> 39:06.260
35 HOURS MAKING SURE THAT THAT
TATTOO IS BULLETPROOF,

39:06.344 --> 39:08.679
AND THAT I'LL BE WALKING OUT
WITH THAT MONEY.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.514
WE COULD DO
A UNDERWATER MERMAID,

39:10.598 --> 39:11.724
AND I COULD PUT
ON TONS OF DETAIL.

39:11.807 --> 39:12.767
LIKE, IF THERE WAS A TURTLE.

39:12.850 --> 39:13.350
- OH, THAT WOULD BE COOL.
- YOU KNOW.

39:13.434 --> 39:14.018
I THINK THAT'S THE WAY

39:14.101 --> 39:15.269
I WANT TO GO.
- OKAY.

39:15.352 --> 39:16.937
- IT'S GONNA BE A FIGHT
TO THE END,

39:17.021 --> 39:19.482
BUT I'M GONNA BE VICTORIOUS.

39:19.565 --> 39:20.691
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR DONATING YOUR CANVAS.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.610
- THANKS.

39:22.693 --> 39:25.112
- WE'LL SEE YOU IN LAS VEGAS.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.614
- I DEFINITELY HAVE TO PROVE
TO THE JUDGES

39:26.697 --> 39:29.658
THAT JUST BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
TATTOOING ONLY SEVEN YEARS...

39:29.742 --> 39:30.910
WE'RE GONNA GO
FOR A BACK PIECE.

39:30.993 --> 39:35.956
DOESN'T MEAN I CAN'T COME UP
WITH A BADASS MASTER CANVAS

39:36.040 --> 39:37.333
AND EXECUTE IT
TECHNICALLY CORRECT.

39:37.416 --> 39:39.460
IT'S DEFINITELY GONNA
BE SOMETHING TOWARDS

39:39.543 --> 39:40.795
THE REALISTIC SIDE.
- YEAH?

39:40.878 --> 39:41.629
- MAYBE A PINUP OR SOMETHING.

39:41.712 --> 39:43.672
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT...
- YEAH?

39:43.756 --> 39:46.467
- YOU KNOW,
WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR.

39:46.550 --> 39:50.012
- I'M GONNA BRING SOMETHING,
JUST, MIND-BLOWING.

39:50.096 --> 39:52.389
I WILL BE THE NEXT INK MASTER.

39:52.473 --> 39:54.642
SEE YOU SOON.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.145
- I'M DEFINITELY
GONNA ROCK THE [bleep]

39:58.229 --> 39:59.897
OUT OF MY FINALE PIECE.

39:59.980 --> 40:01.732
IT'S GONNA BE BADASS.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.486
- RIGHT NOW,
IT'S ALL ABOUT WINNING,

40:05.569 --> 40:07.154
AND THAT'S WHAT
IT'S GONNA COME DOWN TO.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.698
IT'S EITHER GONNA BE YOU OR ME,

40:09.782 --> 40:10.866
AND DAMN WELL SURE BELIEVE
IT'S GONNA BE ME.

40:10.950 --> 40:15.162
