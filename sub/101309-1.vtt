You still sick? Gonna throw up?

01:42.175 --> 01:43.242
A little.

01:43.375 --> 01:45.108
We're almost there, sweetie.

01:45.242 --> 01:47.609
What's the difference
between Memorial Day

01:47.742 --> 01:49.108
and Veterinarians Day?

01:49.242 --> 01:50.943
- You mean Veterans Day!
- Veteran.

01:51.075 --> 01:52.809
- Veterans Day...
- Veterans Day.

01:52.943 --> 01:56.042
...is when we celebrate all the
soldiers that fought for our country.

01:56.175 --> 02:03.042
Memorial Day is the day we remember all
the soldiers that died for our country.

02:03.175 --> 02:04.776
Honey, your Daddy was a veteran.

02:04.909 --> 02:06.209
He fought in the Gulf War.

02:06.342 --> 02:08.542
There was a war over a gulf?

02:08.675 --> 02:10.209
It's a place!

02:10.342 --> 02:11.909
I'm glad you didn't die.

02:12.042 --> 02:15.042
- Me too, cutie.
- Me three!

02:15.175 --> 02:17.108
Can we go fishing
when we get there, Dad?

02:17.242 --> 02:18.476
Oh, honey, when we get there,

02:18.609 --> 02:20.375
I'm gonna hang that sign
around my neck,

02:20.509 --> 02:23.375
'cause you and me,
we are gone fishing, sweetheart.

02:23.509 --> 02:25.642
Can you put the worms
on the hooks for me?

02:25.776 --> 02:26.809
I hate the wormy part.

02:26.943 --> 02:28.542
I got you covered!

02:36.242 --> 02:37.876
- Are we ready?

Should be under Paul,
Paul Michaelson.

Oh, just me, me and my wife.
My wife, Wendy.

03:37.375 --> 03:40.042
Mommy, my game's dead,
do you have a charger?

03:40.175 --> 03:41.843
Yeah, but just a sec, munch.

03:41.975 --> 03:44.943
- And our daughter Taylor.
- Yeah.

03:45.075 --> 03:47.509
- How old's the kid?
- Ten, and don't forget Lucky.

03:47.642 --> 03:50.742
- Yeah, Lucky's our dog.
- You better keep Lucky on a damn leash,

03:50.876 --> 03:53.442
- or he's gonna be unlucky.
- Right!

03:53.576 --> 03:57.075
I'm gonna put you at site 10,
right in front of the lake.

03:57.209 --> 03:59.509
- Stick this on your dash.
- Thank you.

03:59.642 --> 04:01.175
- No loud music after 9.
- Thank you.

04:01.309 --> 04:03.409
- Thank you.
- Stop by with a credit card.

04:03.542 --> 04:05.943
- Okay.
- My store closes at 6.

04:06.075 --> 04:09.175

or I'm gonna charge you another day.

04:09.309 --> 04:12.042
You get a lot of people
out here on Thanksgiving?

04:12.175 --> 04:13.776
Hell, we're rather busy as ever.

04:13.909 --> 04:16.576
We got 12 sites and you're 40
miles from the nearest town.

04:16.709 --> 04:19.409
You're smack dab in the middle
of Shitsville, USA.

04:19.541 --> 04:23.042
You come here looking for a
party, you're in the wrong place.

04:23.943 --> 04:26.275
- Thank you!
- Charming.

04:26.409 --> 04:28.642
Come on, Lucky!

04:56.709 --> 04:58.242
You good?

05:00.742 --> 05:02.442
I guess so.

05:02.576 --> 05:05.909
Hey, be sure to watch your head
on the slide out this time!

05:06.042 --> 05:10.676
Yeah, the nine stitches I got last
time taught me that lesson, thank you!

05:10.809 --> 05:13.242
And Taylor, be sure
to put your fishing boots on,

05:13.375 --> 05:15.509
we don't need an RV
full of mud this time.

05:15.642 --> 05:17.142
Okay, Mama!

05:19.809 --> 05:21.442
Beautiful!

05:21.576 --> 05:25.242
You want to go pay Grandpa
while I finish hooking up here?

05:25.375 --> 05:27.375
Sure, make me do the dirty work?

05:27.509 --> 05:29.909
Yeah. Hey.

05:30.042 --> 05:32.042
I'm really glad
we're doing this.

05:32.175 --> 05:35.108
You know?
It was nice to get away.

05:35.242 --> 05:36.676
Some family time.

05:37.843 --> 05:39.576
It's gonna be good for us.

05:40.275 --> 05:41.676
Good for Taylor too.

05:43.476 --> 05:44.676
- Hon.
- Yeah.

05:44.809 --> 05:47.909
You just had your hands
on the sewage pipe.

05:48.042 --> 05:49.542
Shit.

05:49.676 --> 05:51.042
Literally.

05:52.476 --> 05:55.709
Hey, Taylor,
put a jacket on, huh?

05:55.843 --> 06:00.142
And feed the dog
before we go to the lake, okay?

06:04.476 --> 06:05.476
Tay!

06:05.609 --> 06:07.209
Taylor!

06:07.342 --> 06:10.209
Dad, you want me to feed Lucky
before we go to the lake?

06:10.342 --> 06:12.509

just-just not eating them.

Except fish sticks,
she'll eat those,

08:35.876 --> 08:39.241

they're chicken nuggets.

you're welcome to come over for dinner.

09:56.075 --> 09:57.642
- They don't even have cable.
- Jesus.

09:57.776 --> 10:00.776
Remember when we used
to camp out with 15 bucks?

10:00.909 --> 10:02.609
No. I don't.

10:02.742 --> 10:03.909
Oh, yeah, worms are up too.

10:04.042 --> 10:05.542
Jesus, expensive little fuckers.

10:05.676 --> 10:08.609

could make s'mores tonight.

10:08.742 --> 10:09.709

10:24.676 --> 10:26.375
Yeah, look at that.

10:26.509 --> 10:29.042
And look, there's even got
some motorboats out here.

10:29.175 --> 10:31.242
Oh, I don't know
if that's a good idea.

10:31.375 --> 10:34.876
You remember that dinner cruise
we took on that boat?

10:35.008 --> 10:38.209
- Oh, God.
- You know, she projectile vomited all over that one.

10:38.342 --> 10:41.809
Oh, God, I'd forgotten
all about that, Jesus Christ.

10:41.943 --> 10:45.342

It was.

10:49.642 --> 10:50.975

- Hey, Lucky. No, no, no.
- Hey, Lucky!

10:56.709 --> 10:59.042
- What the hell are you doing out?
- No, no, no, honey. You can't.

10:59.175 --> 11:01.642
Honey, Taylor, you can't leave
Lucky outside, babe!

11:01.776 --> 11:03.476
He's gotta be on the leash!

11:03.609 --> 11:07.242

All right.

11:16.442 --> 11:19.175
I am gonna make lunch
while you guys are out fishing.

11:19.309 --> 11:20.843
How long do you think
you're gonna be?

11:20.975 --> 11:22.909
I think we're gonna be
maybe an hour,

11:23.042 --> 11:24.008
something like that.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.075
- Yeah.
- You know.

11:30.676 --> 11:32.576

11:48.809 --> 11:50.476

- Taylor!
- No, no, hey, hey, hey.

12:00.609 --> 12:01.843
I'll find her.

12:01.975 --> 12:03.676
Hey, Taylor!

12:03.809 --> 12:05.975
Taylor!

12:06.943 --> 12:08.609
What?

12:08.742 --> 12:10.008
Hey!

12:11.108 --> 12:13.943
- She's...
- Paul, she's not in there.

12:14.075 --> 12:16.375
Did she come out when I went up
to the office?

12:16.509 --> 12:17.709
I don't know.

12:17.843 --> 12:21.142
I mean I was on the other side
of the RV, I...

12:21.275 --> 12:24.042
- Taylor!
- I didn't hear her come out.

12:24.175 --> 12:26.709
Taylor!

12:30.509 --> 12:32.242
She's probably just hiding,
right?

12:32.375 --> 12:34.576
- Oh, hiding, huh?
- She couldn't have gone far.

12:34.709 --> 12:37.042
If she's hiding,
she's gonna be in big trouble.

12:37.175 --> 12:38.709
Here, here, the outhouse.

12:38.843 --> 12:40.609

13:00.409 --> 13:03.209
She's... She's gotta be...

13:03.975 --> 13:05.642
here somewhere.

13:05.776 --> 13:08.609
- Where could she go?
- Taylor!

13:09.676 --> 13:12.042
- Check...
- Taylor!

13:12.876 --> 13:14.709
She's gotta be close by.

13:14.843 --> 13:16.742
Taylor!

13:18.509 --> 13:19.542
Taylor!

13:20.742 --> 13:22.342
Hey, Tay!

13:24.175 --> 13:27.542

Taylor!

13:43.108 --> 13:46.642
- We got a little girl...
- They already filled me in before on the ride over.

13:46.776 --> 13:49.175
Let's go the south
and west end of the lake.

13:49.309 --> 13:51.509
They're ringing on the phone
for Franklin County,

13:51.642 --> 13:53.209
- see if we get a helicopter.
- Done.

13:53.342 --> 13:55.476
Any word on that runner?

13:55.609 --> 13:58.175
Found his blood in the woods
a few miles from the prison.

13:58.309 --> 14:01.008
- Suspect he's wounded.
- Good, slow him down.

14:01.142 --> 14:02.275
All right, anything else?

14:02.409 --> 14:04.075
FBI called about the convict.

14:04.209 --> 14:06.542
Told him about the girl,
he asked if we needed help.

14:06.676 --> 14:09.476
Yeah, well you tell him
I got it covered.

14:09.609 --> 14:11.776
- Parents?
- Yep.

14:11.909 --> 14:13.442
Not a word to them
about the prisoner

14:13.576 --> 14:15.409
till we get any updates,
all right?

14:15.542 --> 14:16.776
They already know.

14:16.909 --> 14:18.709
Well, shit.

14:22.975 --> 14:26.042
Mr. Michaelson, Mrs. Michaelson,

14:26.175 --> 14:27.509
Sheriff Baker.

14:27.642 --> 14:29.442
I'm gonna be running
the investigation.

14:29.576 --> 14:31.876
Do you think the prisoner
had anything to do with this?

14:32.008 --> 14:33.642
Well, I can see why
you'd be concerned,

14:33.776 --> 14:36.476
but the last thing that a runner
that's been shot is gonna want

14:36.609 --> 14:38.008
is to pick up a kid
and slow him down.

14:38.142 --> 14:39.742
He was shot?

14:39.876 --> 14:41.576
Yeah.

14:41.709 --> 14:46.108
I promise, I'll always be as
transparent and as honest as I can be.

14:46.242 --> 14:47.843
You got a partner here.

14:47.975 --> 14:49.909
We'll get through this.

14:50.042 --> 14:52.309
We'll find her, together.

14:52.442 --> 14:53.542
Yeah.

14:53.676 --> 14:55.576
Mind if I sit down?

14:55.709 --> 14:57.742
Yeah, sure.

15:00.742 --> 15:04.576
I know it's hard,
but if you can try to remember.

15:05.709 --> 15:08.375
Now I know Mrs. Michaelson
was at the store,

15:08.509 --> 15:12.209
and Mr. Michaelson, I heard
you were on the other side,

15:12.342 --> 15:13.909
hooking up the RV,
is that right?

15:14.042 --> 15:16.375
- Yeah.
- You remember hearing anything?

15:16.509 --> 15:17.642
No.

15:17.776 --> 15:19.309
A door maybe, footsteps?

15:19.442 --> 15:20.909
- Nothing.
- A voice, cries?

15:21.042 --> 15:22.476
I was on the other side
of the RV,

15:22.609 --> 15:26.108
I'm hooking it up,
I get my fishing poles,

15:26.242 --> 15:30.309
turn around,
I see another camper.

15:30.442 --> 15:33.975
And that would be
Miss Miranda Hudson.

15:34.108 --> 15:36.008
- I guess, yeah.
- She gave us a statement.

15:36.142 --> 15:39.442
She said her and her husband are traveling
across country for a couple weeks.

15:39.576 --> 15:42.075
Well, I didn't see him, I mean,

15:42.209 --> 15:43.909
did he see anything?

15:44.042 --> 15:45.642
He said he was in his RV
watching TV.

15:45.776 --> 15:49.275
What about anybody else?
Did anybody else see anything?

15:49.409 --> 15:51.843
We don't get many visits up here
in the winter.

15:51.975 --> 15:54.776
It's a bit a ways,
as you can see.

15:54.909 --> 15:59.008
Other than Mr. And Mrs. Hudson
and the owner, Tom Henry,

15:59.142 --> 16:03.008
and groundskeeper
named Justin Knowles.

16:04.175 --> 16:05.742
He was there.

16:05.876 --> 16:07.209
He was right there, I seen him.

16:07.342 --> 16:11.409
He drove by right here
on his Gator, thing.

16:11.542 --> 16:15.075
He was, shit, it was just
right after the disappearance.

16:15.209 --> 16:16.876
I mean, do...

16:17.008 --> 16:19.175
Well, we questioned both,

16:19.309 --> 16:22.175
and Tom says the last time he
saw was when you pulled in.

16:22.876 --> 16:24.642
They could have lied.

16:25.642 --> 16:26.909
We don't know them.

16:27.042 --> 16:29.943
Look, there is no evidence
of foul play here.

16:30.075 --> 16:32.709
All right.
That being said,

16:32.843 --> 16:36.309
I've asked that no one leave
until we further investigate.

16:36.442 --> 16:39.975
Now Mr. Henry and Mr. Knowles, they live
on the property, that's not a problem.

16:40.108 --> 16:46.175
But I have no legal right to
detain the Hudsons without cause.

16:46.309 --> 16:47.909
No, of course not.

16:48.042 --> 16:51.809
But they have offered to stay a while.
Help with your daughter.

16:51.943 --> 16:54.975
The only advice I can give you
is stay as calm as you can.

16:55.108 --> 16:57.642
Most of the time
these kids just wander away.

16:57.776 --> 17:01.576
How long do you think she's gonna survive
in the woods having just wandered off?

17:01.709 --> 17:04.541
We're bringing in a mobile unit.
We're gonna tape off all the area.

17:04.675 --> 17:07.375
We're gonna have search teams
working all through the night.

17:07.509 --> 17:10.476
Okay? I want you two to stay
here in case she comes back.

17:10.608 --> 17:14.642
Why? Don't you think
we should be looking with you?

17:14.776 --> 17:16.275
Yeah, what are we gonna do?

17:16.409 --> 17:18.541
I told you I'll be honest
with you, and I will.

17:18.675 --> 17:21.142
This runner,
he's armed and he's dangerous.

17:21.275 --> 17:23.509
Now I don't think
he has your daughter, I don't.

17:23.642 --> 17:26.175
I don't want you out in the
woods while he's running loose.

17:26.309 --> 17:28.409
You stay here,
I'll have my men protect you.

17:32.442 --> 17:33.909
Take this.

17:34.042 --> 17:35.542
As soon as we get any update,

17:35.676 --> 17:38.509
I'll have the team call you
and let you know right away.

17:39.542 --> 17:43.008
If you need anything,
you call me.

17:43.142 --> 17:45.175
Anytime.

17:49.375 --> 17:54.242
Thirty-two years I've been
in this department come May,

17:54.375 --> 17:56.975
and I've never lost a child.

17:57.642 --> 17:58.676
Not one.

18:01.209 --> 18:02.476
And I don't plan to.

18:03.876 --> 18:06.108
We'll find her.

18:06.876 --> 18:09.108
- Okay?
- Yeah.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.876
Easy, easy, shh, shh.

18:24.008 --> 18:25.409
It's okay.

18:42.409 --> 18:44.776
We should be out there
searching too.

18:48.309 --> 18:52.542
There is a team
of police out there, Wendy.

18:54.509 --> 18:56.275
Just stop.

18:59.175 --> 19:01.375
They're looking for her.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.542
They'll find her.

19:29.375 --> 19:31.175
Please.

19:32.542 --> 19:33.576
Please, Paul.

19:39.809 --> 19:42.142
We have to look for her.

19:44.776 --> 19:49.042
What if
the convict has her?

20:25.008 --> 20:27.442
We gotta sneak by the cops.

20:34.576 --> 20:36.075
If they see us...

20:38.242 --> 20:40.108
they'll stop us.

20:57.975 --> 20:59.242
Taylor!

20:59.375 --> 21:01.909
Taylor!

21:02.042 --> 21:04.709
- Taylor!
- Taylor!

21:04.843 --> 21:06.476
Taylor!

21:06.609 --> 21:08.008
Taylor!

21:08.142 --> 21:10.008
Taylor!

21:10.676 --> 21:11.776
Taylor!

21:11.909 --> 21:14.309
Taylor!

21:15.142 --> 21:17.142
Taylor!

21:18.843 --> 21:20.509
What is that?

21:22.008 --> 21:24.242
It looks like a campfire.

21:39.375 --> 21:42.442
That's him,
they said he'd been shot.

21:42.576 --> 21:45.309
Wendy, stop,
we have to get the police.

21:45.442 --> 21:47.609
No, he'll be gone by then.

21:47.742 --> 21:49.409
We have to hold him here.

21:49.542 --> 21:50.776
I'll grab the gun.

21:50.909 --> 21:52.042
Wendy.

21:52.175 --> 21:54.609
Wait, stop.

21:54.742 --> 21:55.809
Wendy, stop.

21:58.776 --> 22:02.375
Shh, shh.

22:30.242 --> 22:31.709
Give me the gun.

22:32.742 --> 22:34.042
Wendy, give me the...

22:39.275 --> 22:41.509
Did you hear that?

22:41.642 --> 22:44.175
<i>Sounds like it
came from the other side of the lake.</i>

22:44.309 --> 22:45.709
<i>Get your men over there now.</i>

22:45.843 --> 22:47.275
Let's move!

23:52.275 --> 23:53.509
We have to tell them.

23:53.642 --> 23:55.209
Tell them what?

23:56.309 --> 23:58.742
- The truth.
- We can't do that.

23:58.876 --> 24:01.042
We have to.

24:05.742 --> 24:08.209
It was an accident.

24:08.342 --> 24:10.242
Honey, you could tell them.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.709
You could tell them a guy tried
to attack you

24:13.843 --> 24:16.042
and, you know...

24:16.175 --> 24:19.576
he's an escaped convict
for fuck's sake.

24:19.709 --> 24:22.008
Eh, who's gonna miss him?

24:22.142 --> 24:23.509
Did 'em a favor.

24:23.642 --> 24:25.242
Paul.

24:27.809 --> 24:30.375
We have to tell them the truth.

24:33.542 --> 24:36.242
They'll take you away, Wendy.

24:36.375 --> 24:39.542
I'm not gonna let
that happen, okay?

24:39.676 --> 24:43.542
You understand that I would do
anything to keep that from happening.

24:43.676 --> 24:48.309
I'm not gonna lose
both of you, okay?

24:50.975 --> 24:53.409
We gotta stick together on this.

24:55.375 --> 24:58.375
That's the only way
we're gonna get through this.

24:59.975 --> 25:02.642
We have to tell them the truth.

25:05.442 --> 25:08.209
Mr. And Mrs. Michaelson.

25:08.342 --> 25:09.409
Hello?

25:24.108 --> 25:26.975
It's the sheriff, hello?

25:43.242 --> 25:45.075
Anybody home?

25:45.209 --> 25:47.542
Yeah, hang on!

25:51.008 --> 25:54.108
Hey, Sheriff, how you doing?

25:54.242 --> 25:56.209
You wanna come on in?

25:56.342 --> 26:00.409
Wendy's just in the back
getting dressed, so.

26:00.542 --> 26:01.809
Oh, yeah.

26:01.943 --> 26:04.742
Yeah, it was a long night,
you know.

26:04.876 --> 26:06.476
Yeah, how you doing?

26:06.609 --> 26:07.642
You want some coffee?

26:07.776 --> 26:08.943
Thanks, yeah.

26:09.075 --> 26:11.242
Sugar if you have any.

26:11.375 --> 26:12.476
I do.

26:16.342 --> 26:19.476
I've yet to get to sleep myself.

26:19.609 --> 26:20.809
Yeah.

26:25.108 --> 26:26.609
Any news?

26:26.742 --> 26:29.576
Let's wait till your wife
comes out, and we can all talk.

26:29.709 --> 26:31.509
Easier that way.

26:31.642 --> 26:33.175
Okay.

26:39.843 --> 26:41.075
What's that?

26:41.776 --> 26:43.342
What's what?

26:44.509 --> 26:47.676
- That coffee maker.
- Oh, this...

26:47.809 --> 26:49.843
I was thinking about getting one
of those for my wife.

26:49.975 --> 26:52.075
You know,
I don't know what that is.

26:52.209 --> 26:54.542
Something my wife picked up,
you know.

26:54.676 --> 26:56.876
I don't even know
where the hell she got it.

26:57.008 --> 26:59.142
Um, I can add a little sugar.

26:59.275 --> 27:02.242
I think I got
just enough left here.

27:04.008 --> 27:06.275
There we go.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.275
Okay.

27:11.075 --> 27:11.943
Here you go.

27:12.075 --> 27:13.008
Shit!

27:13.142 --> 27:14.108
I'm so sorry!

27:14.242 --> 27:16.876
- God, Jesus!
- All right.

27:17.008 --> 27:19.309
- I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

27:19.442 --> 27:26.008
Gosh, I'm just so jittery
this morning.

27:29.676 --> 27:31.008
Rough night, man.

27:31.142 --> 27:32.509
Just, you know.

27:36.776 --> 27:38.008
Sheriff.

27:38.142 --> 27:39.609
How you doing?

27:40.975 --> 27:42.142
Why don't you sit down?

27:42.275 --> 27:44.342
Let's all sit down for a minute.

27:57.108 --> 28:01.542
Well, we found
the escaped inmate.

28:05.843 --> 28:07.108
Sheriff.

28:07.242 --> 28:09.342
Arrested him on a bus...

28:10.909 --> 28:13.142
trying to cross state lines.

28:14.442 --> 28:17.843
Questioned him,
and there's no indication that

28:17.975 --> 28:21.642
he has anything to do with the
disappearance of your daughter.

28:22.642 --> 28:25.108
- Oh, thank God.
- Hmm.

28:25.909 --> 28:27.275
Yeah.

28:30.909 --> 28:32.142
Good.

28:32.275 --> 28:35.843
Both of you heard
that gunshot last night,

28:35.975 --> 28:37.476
but we looked into it
this morning,

28:37.609 --> 28:39.242
and on the south side
of the lake,

28:39.375 --> 28:41.876
we found the body of a camper.

28:42.008 --> 28:43.943
Been killed.

28:44.075 --> 28:45.975
Wait, I don't understand.

28:46.108 --> 28:47.943
You found a camper...

28:48.075 --> 28:49.275
Survivor.

28:49.409 --> 28:51.509
He was a survival weekend guys.

28:51.642 --> 28:53.342
They come up here
from time to time,

28:53.476 --> 28:57.108
to just spend the weekend trying
to survive off the land.

28:57.242 --> 28:59.142
Sometimes a little longer.

29:00.342 --> 29:01.909
Uh-huh.

29:02.042 --> 29:07.075
So, do you think there's some
kind of connection between...

29:07.209 --> 29:09.476
Right now, we're treating it
as two separate cases.

29:09.609 --> 29:11.242
That's the best way
to go about it.

29:11.375 --> 29:14.008
There's no indication
there is any connection.

29:14.142 --> 29:17.476
Your daughter's out there,
we're gonna find her.

29:17.609 --> 29:19.142
Sure.

29:19.275 --> 29:21.476
Yeah, I mean, what else, yeah.

29:21.609 --> 29:24.709
I'm gonna need you to come down
to the station.

29:24.843 --> 29:27.709
Okay. Well, what for, why?

29:27.843 --> 29:31.309
Well, we need to file a
official missing person report.

29:31.442 --> 29:33.142
It's been over 24 hours now.

29:33.275 --> 29:36.142
Bring some pictures,
some videos.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.676
Anything you think might help.

29:40.075 --> 29:41.642
Sure.

29:41.776 --> 29:43.309
We'll be there.

29:44.209 --> 29:45.742
We'll be there.

29:50.609 --> 29:53.476
...take a search party around
the other side of the lake.

29:54.809 --> 29:56.742
What have I done?
What have I done?

29:56.876 --> 29:59.442
What have I done?
I killed a man. I killed a man.

29:59.576 --> 30:02.509
I killed... I killed an innocent man.
Oh, my God, I killed...

30:02.642 --> 30:05.075
There's nothing we can do
about that, you hear me?

30:05.209 --> 30:06.742
I killed an innocent man.

30:06.876 --> 30:09.042
Taylor is missing.

30:09.175 --> 30:11.843
We need to focus on that, okay?

30:11.975 --> 30:16.375
Hey, hey,
it was an accident, okay?

30:21.609 --> 30:25.476
I, uh... I'm real sorry to hear
about your daughter.

30:25.609 --> 30:28.175
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

30:28.309 --> 30:31.442
I'm Justin.
I take care of this place.

30:34.709 --> 30:36.642
- Justin, I'm Paul.
- Paul.

30:36.776 --> 30:38.509
This is my wife, Wendy.

30:40.275 --> 30:42.542
You guys must be pretty bummed.

30:42.676 --> 30:45.342
I mean, the cops asked me
if I saw anything weird

30:45.476 --> 30:48.042
and I was just dumping trash
in the Gator, you know.

30:48.175 --> 30:51.975
I didn't see nothing. It was just like...
It's like any other day, you know?

30:52.108 --> 30:54.008
Thanks.

30:54.742 --> 30:56.442
How old was she?

30:57.642 --> 30:59.209
Ten.

31:03.742 --> 31:04.975
Why?

31:06.509 --> 31:09.075
Why did you ask how old she was?

31:09.209 --> 31:10.642
Why did you say "was"?

31:10.776 --> 31:13.375
He said "How old was she?"
Is that what he just asked?

31:13.509 --> 31:16.042
- How old was my daughter?
- No, no, I didn't mean that.

31:16.175 --> 31:18.108
I was just thinking, um...

31:18.242 --> 31:20.008
I don't know why I said that.

31:20.142 --> 31:21.709
All right, thank you, Justin.

31:21.843 --> 31:24.242
Okay, anyway, if you guys
need anything or whatever,

31:24.375 --> 31:27.375
I'm in my trailer at site four
just around there, all right.

31:28.909 --> 31:30.409
Okay.

31:30.542 --> 31:33.309
I heard about the dead camper,
that's pretty fucked.

31:34.909 --> 31:36.409
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

32:56.008 --> 32:57.142
What is going on?

32:57.275 --> 32:59.409
What... What's happening?

32:59.542 --> 33:02.676
Yeah, we come to fill out
a missing persons report, okay,

33:02.809 --> 33:06.142
- but I feel like you guys are treating us like criminals here.
- Yeah, yeah.

33:06.275 --> 33:07.776
Standard procedure I'm afraid.

33:07.909 --> 33:09.042
I know it doesn't
feel very good.

33:09.175 --> 33:11.108
Feel very good?
It's just...

33:11.242 --> 33:12.676
isn't this wasting time?

33:12.809 --> 33:15.375
- I mean, this time here...
- We're combing the lake.

33:15.509 --> 33:17.642
There's a lot of land to cover.
We'll get it done.

33:17.776 --> 33:20.876
- Tell us how this gets our daughter back?
- Yeah.

33:21.008 --> 33:22.342
I wanna get her face out there.

33:22.476 --> 33:24.609
The more eyes looking for her,
the better.

33:24.742 --> 33:26.175
And better it come from you.

33:26.309 --> 33:28.809
People tend to listen
a bit more that way.

33:28.943 --> 33:31.042
What... What are you
talking about?

33:31.175 --> 33:32.409
Press conference.

33:32.542 --> 33:35.576
Jeffrey Michaelson,
that your father?

33:35.709 --> 33:36.843
My brother.

33:36.975 --> 33:38.242
All right.

33:38.375 --> 33:40.075
Might wanna give
your family a call,

33:40.209 --> 33:41.975
let 'em know what's going on.

33:42.843 --> 33:44.075
Oh.

33:46.042 --> 33:47.609
At this time,
we have no indications

33:47.742 --> 33:49.409
that Taylor Michaelson
has been kidnapped

33:49.542 --> 33:51.142
or that there is any foul play.

33:51.275 --> 33:53.108
The homicide in the woods
is a separate case

33:53.242 --> 33:55.075
until we find a connection
that says otherwise.

33:55.209 --> 33:57.175
If you are part of a fire
or a police reserve

33:57.309 --> 34:00.409
and would like to volunteer to join
the search, please contact my office.

34:00.542 --> 34:02.209
The Michaelsons would like
to make a statement.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.075
We pray to God
that our daughter, Taylor,

34:06.209 --> 34:08.175
comes back to us unharmed.

34:08.309 --> 34:10.309
<i>I would do anything
to get my daughter back.</i>

34:10.442 --> 34:12.576
Ah, fuck! Fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

34:24.975 --> 34:27.509
Hey, Jeffrey, it's your brother.

34:27.641 --> 34:30.708
Listen, Wendy and I are having
a little trouble with Taylor.

34:30.842 --> 34:32.576
So...

34:35.007 --> 34:38.309
So give me a call, okay.

34:38.442 --> 34:40.007
Please.

35:06.342 --> 35:07.509
Shh.

35:07.642 --> 35:09.642
Lucky!

35:09.776 --> 35:11.275
- Lucky, hey, Lucky!
- Hey!

35:11.409 --> 35:12.809
Hi, sorry.

35:12.943 --> 35:15.242
I hope we're not interrupting.

35:15.375 --> 35:16.943
We thought maybe you guys
might be hungry,

35:17.075 --> 35:19.042
so we brought you some dinner.

35:19.175 --> 35:20.909
- Wow.
- I'm Eric.

35:21.042 --> 35:23.509
- Hi.
- You've already met my wife, Miranda.

35:23.642 --> 35:26.576
Yep. Yep.

35:27.476 --> 35:29.309
Thanks. Wendy.
I'm Wendy. Hi.

35:29.442 --> 35:31.309
It's the least we could do.

35:31.442 --> 35:33.642
Feel free to join us
if you want.

35:33.776 --> 35:35.142
Oh, no, thank you.

35:35.275 --> 35:37.342
We don't wanna intrude.

35:37.476 --> 35:40.676
Plus, the police told us that
we could help search tonight.

35:40.809 --> 35:42.042
Eric is a reserve fireman...

35:42.175 --> 35:43.442
Part-time.

35:43.576 --> 35:45.342
I'm a musician.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.609
Hey, hey, quiet!
I'm sorry about that.

35:47.742 --> 35:50.776
That's all right. I'm not really
a big dog person. They can tell.

35:50.909 --> 35:55.142
Look, we can only
imagine how hard this must be.

35:55.275 --> 35:58.309
So if there's anything
that you need, we'd...

36:00.342 --> 36:01.843
Thanks, guys, thank you.

36:01.975 --> 36:04.442
We really...
We really appreciate it.

36:04.576 --> 36:07.242
- Just let us know.
- Sure. Thanks for the help.

36:07.375 --> 36:09.375
Uh-huh.

36:17.375 --> 36:19.609
What's going on, Wendy?

36:19.742 --> 36:21.709
Our daughter is missing,

36:21.843 --> 36:24.209
and you're inviting
Miss Congeniality to dinner!

36:24.342 --> 36:26.943
Hey, hey, what the hell
are you talking about, Wendy?

36:27.075 --> 36:28.776
I'm trying to be a nice guy.

36:28.909 --> 36:30.609
- Nice?
- Yeah.

36:31.943 --> 36:33.442
Nice?

36:33.576 --> 36:36.342
You don't think I saw the way
that you looked at her? Huh?

36:36.476 --> 36:39.108
You don't think that maybe
if you didn't get distracted

36:39.242 --> 36:41.409
- our daughter wouldn't still...
- Okay, stop, stop!

36:41.542 --> 36:43.075
- ...be in this trailer?
- Stop, stop!

36:43.209 --> 36:44.709
Okay, I know what this is about.

36:44.843 --> 36:46.943
All right, don't blame me.

36:47.108 --> 36:50.476
Do you think that's gonna bring
her back? Hmm?

36:53.209 --> 36:55.542
It was a long time ago, Wendy.

36:55.676 --> 36:58.075
I told you
that would never happen again,

36:58.209 --> 36:59.642
and that's what I meant.

37:01.909 --> 37:06.342
Okay, I fucked up!
But don't keep beating me up about it!

37:06.476 --> 37:08.175
Taylor's the only reason
I'm with you!

37:08.309 --> 37:10.075
- Knock it off!
- Taylor's the only reason

37:10.209 --> 37:11.776
- I'm with you!
- Stop it!

37:11.909 --> 37:13.375
- We don't have anything, Paul!
- Shh!

37:13.509 --> 37:15.042
We don't have anything, Paul!

37:15.175 --> 37:16.943
We don't have anything
without Taylor!

37:17.075 --> 37:19.509
What do we have, Paul?
What do we have?

37:19.642 --> 37:22.442
Tell me, what do we have
without our daughter?

37:22.576 --> 37:25.108
We have each other.

37:25.242 --> 37:26.876
Hey, hey, hey.

37:27.008 --> 37:29.809
We have each other.

37:29.943 --> 37:32.175
That's all we have,

37:32.309 --> 37:34.742
and we're gonna
get through this.

37:37.776 --> 37:39.542
Together.

37:42.008 --> 37:44.242
- You and me.
- We'll get through it.

37:44.375 --> 37:47.175
- You and me.
- We're all right.

38:44.042 --> 38:48.375
Are you getting anywhere on that
little girl's disappearance?

38:54.676 --> 38:57.375
You can't take it home
with you, John.

39:00.075 --> 39:02.209
It's not fair to me.

39:17.175 --> 39:21.008
<i>There's some
thunder and lightning outside,</i>

39:21.142 --> 39:23.309
<i>and I miss you! Mwah!</i>

39:23.442 --> 39:26.609
<i>And I have three friends that...</i>

39:28.008 --> 39:32.075
<i>three friends that are Korean,</i>

39:32.209 --> 39:35.008
<i>that one of them knows Korean.</i>

39:35.142 --> 39:37.375
<i>It's... Happy birthday,
and they went up</i>

39:37.509 --> 39:41.576
<i>in front of the whole class
and sang it to everybody.</i>

39:41.709 --> 39:42.876
<i>This is how you sing it.</i>

39:43.008 --> 39:44.409
We gotta get some sleep.
Come on.

39:44.542 --> 39:47.442
You haven't slept in two days.

39:47.576 --> 39:49.042
Oh, I know.

39:49.175 --> 39:52.209
- Come to bed with me.
- No, I can't.

39:52.342 --> 39:54.975
I mean, I want to, but I can't.

39:55.108 --> 39:57.876
I've already taken two Ambien.

39:58.008 --> 40:04.375
My body's so tired,
but I cannot stop my mind from racing.

40:06.042 --> 40:09.175
Eric... Eric told the police

40:09.309 --> 40:13.642
that he was watching TV.
There's no cable here.

40:13.776 --> 40:15.409
Eric.

40:15.542 --> 40:18.576
And Lucky... Lucky was looking
at them. Lucky was barking.

40:18.709 --> 40:20.776
Lucky never barks
at anybody like that.

40:20.909 --> 40:22.509
Why was he barking
at him like that?

40:22.642 --> 40:25.175
- Okay.
- Why?

40:25.309 --> 40:26.576
Why?

40:26.709 --> 40:28.843
Why?

40:28.975 --> 40:30.375
Why do dogs do anything?

40:30.509 --> 40:31.709
Where you going?

40:32.709 --> 40:34.242
Going to bed?

40:34.375 --> 40:35.975
I'm gonna call the sheriff.

40:36.108 --> 40:37.642
What?

40:37.776 --> 40:38.742
Give me that!

40:38.876 --> 40:40.108
- What? Give it to me.
- Hey!

40:40.242 --> 40:42.576
- What are you doing?
- To tell him what? Ow!

40:42.709 --> 40:44.809
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, but what are you gonna tell him?

40:44.943 --> 40:47.476
- I was gonna tell him that the guy was lying!
- Our dog barked?

40:54.776 --> 40:58.975
You know what, they said that they were
gonna go help with the search party, right?

40:59.108 --> 41:01.209
So maybe we should just...

41:02.642 --> 41:03.975
go look around.

41:04.108 --> 41:05.776
- Give me that.
- What?

41:05.909 --> 41:06.975
That's crazy. Come on.

41:07.108 --> 41:08.709
You and me are going to bed.

41:08.843 --> 41:10.409
That's what we're gonna do.

41:10.542 --> 41:11.975
Now come on.

41:12.108 --> 41:16.008
- What if she's over there?
- Huh?

41:16.142 --> 41:19.943
What if Taylor is over there
tied up?

41:21.709 --> 41:24.375
Fifty feet away.

41:30.509 --> 41:32.209
Paul.

41:48.809 --> 41:50.242
Don't slam it.

41:54.576 --> 41:56.008
I'll check the back.

42:16.809 --> 42:18.275
Damn it.

42:31.843 --> 42:34.742
Hey, did you check?

42:34.876 --> 42:36.209
Yeah.

42:36.342 --> 42:37.709
Sorry.

42:59.909 --> 43:01.309
Paul.

43:04.843 --> 43:05.943
Yeah.

43:06.075 --> 43:08.776
Prenatal drugs.
That's clomiphene.

43:08.909 --> 43:11.809
IVF injectors,
prenatal vitamins.

43:11.943 --> 43:14.209
They were trying to have a baby.

43:14.342 --> 43:16.042
Okay.

43:16.175 --> 43:18.342
What if they were trying
to have a baby so badly

43:18.476 --> 43:21.309
that they took ours instead?

43:21.442 --> 43:24.175
Or maybe they're just
trying to have a baby.

43:24.309 --> 43:26.709
- Come on.
- She said that they were newlyweds.

43:26.843 --> 43:28.142
What?

43:28.909 --> 43:30.509
They're newlyweds.

43:32.342 --> 43:34.142
What if Miranda
was distracting you

43:34.275 --> 43:38.509
so that her husband
could take our daughter?

43:42.409 --> 43:45.542
Okay, so,
what'd they do with her?

43:47.843 --> 43:50.476
The compartments down below.

43:56.943 --> 43:58.209
Nothing there.

44:04.042 --> 44:05.909
Look at this one here.

44:06.042 --> 44:07.776
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hurry up.

44:07.909 --> 44:11.175
Oh... locked.

44:11.309 --> 44:13.142
- Hi.
- Jesus...

44:13.275 --> 44:14.676
Christ,
you guys scared us.

44:14.809 --> 44:17.776
Man, we were just coming back

44:17.909 --> 44:19.876
to see if you guys
were back yet.

44:20.008 --> 44:21.108
- We were wondering...
- Yeah.

44:21.242 --> 44:23.509
if anybody found anything.

44:23.642 --> 44:25.442
Anybody find anything?

44:25.576 --> 44:27.609
No. Uh...

44:27.742 --> 44:29.442
They're still out there.

44:29.576 --> 44:32.075
We just came back
'cause she wasn't feeling well.

44:32.209 --> 44:35.576
Yeah, I didn't get much sleep
last night.

44:35.709 --> 44:37.242
Me neither.

44:39.275 --> 44:42.342
Yeah, I'm sure we could all
use a little sleep.

44:42.476 --> 44:47.008
So, you know, it's just been
one of those days.

44:47.142 --> 44:48.975
So let's go.

44:49.108 --> 44:51.409
Good night. Come on, honey.

44:52.809 --> 44:54.676
But, you know, hey, you guys.

44:54.809 --> 44:57.843
You know, Paul and I were thinking
of sneaking one of the fishing boats

44:57.975 --> 45:02.075
out in the morning to search the
lake, but they won't let us search,

45:02.209 --> 45:05.375
but they'd let you,
so maybe if we go together?

45:06.275 --> 45:10.175
- Uh, I...
- Yeah, absolutely.

45:10.309 --> 45:13.742
We'll meet you guys
at the dock at 7 a.m.

45:13.876 --> 45:18.008
Okay, thank you.
Wow.

45:18.142 --> 45:20.275
- Thanks.
- Good night.

45:20.409 --> 45:21.709
Come on.

45:39.209 --> 45:41.175
Shh, Lucky!

45:42.075 --> 45:43.642
Shh!

45:55.409 --> 45:56.709
Shh, shh.

45:58.409 --> 45:59.642
Baby!

46:01.709 --> 46:02.876
Shh, hey!

46:03.008 --> 46:04.442
Shut up.

46:07.542 --> 46:08.975
Hey, shh, shh.

46:21.476 --> 46:23.609
Right there, right there.

47:24.309 --> 47:26.476
What are you doing?

47:29.142 --> 47:30.709
Are you serious right now?

47:30.843 --> 47:31.975
- Hey.
- Knock it off.

47:32.108 --> 47:33.375
Hey, hey, hey.

47:34.075 --> 47:36.209
Oh, please, Paul.

47:38.108 --> 47:39.108
Wendy.

47:39.242 --> 47:40.642
Would you knock it off?

47:45.843 --> 47:47.209
You're completely nuts.

47:48.375 --> 47:51.309
- I said, stop.
- Shut up, honey.

47:52.609 --> 47:54.042
Get off me.

47:57.709 --> 47:59.542
Oh, my God. Just get off me.

47:59.676 --> 48:01.476
Don't do that.

48:01.609 --> 48:03.476
Don't do that.

48:09.576 --> 48:10.642
Where'd you go?

48:32.175 --> 48:35.742
Listen, about last night,
I wanted to tell you...

48:35.876 --> 48:38.242
I don't wanna talk about that.

48:40.175 --> 48:42.042
Fine. Uh...

48:42.175 --> 48:44.008
You wanna tell me what
we're doing here?

48:44.142 --> 48:45.709
I thought you didn't even like
these people,

48:45.843 --> 48:48.142
then you wanna invite 'em out
for an afternoon on the lake.

48:48.275 --> 48:51.442
We are getting them alone, gonna get information,
and then we're gonna go to the police.

48:51.576 --> 48:53.676
We can go to the police now
and tell them what we found.

48:53.809 --> 48:56.275
That's a good idea. After we tell
them that we broke into their RV

48:56.409 --> 48:58.242
and searched through
all their belongings,

48:58.375 --> 49:00.876
maybe we can tell them
that I killed a camper too!

49:01.042 --> 49:03.943
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

49:04.075 --> 49:07.175
Thanks for doing this, guys.
We appreciate it.

49:07.309 --> 49:10.142
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no worries.

49:13.142 --> 49:15.542
Okay.
All right.

49:21.542 --> 49:22.576
Okay.

49:27.008 --> 49:29.008
All right.

49:29.142 --> 49:31.409
Get us off the dock here.

49:31.542 --> 49:33.642
Okay.

49:34.576 --> 49:36.309
We're good.

50:34.075 --> 50:35.909
Maybe we should head back now.

50:36.042 --> 50:37.742
I think we're almost out of gas.

50:39.576 --> 50:40.876
Hey, wait.

50:41.008 --> 50:43.975
There's something... There's
something floating over there.

50:44.108 --> 50:47.642
Right on the edge of the lake,
look. See?

50:47.776 --> 50:49.442
Oh, yeah, no, I see it.

50:49.576 --> 50:53.008
I mean, it's something...
Something's floating over there.

50:59.843 --> 51:00.943
What is it?

51:01.075 --> 51:02.676
It looks like
a plastic trash bag.

51:02.809 --> 51:05.576
- No.
- Come on, guys. We've been out here six hours,

51:05.709 --> 51:08.509
getting dehydrated. We should head
back, get some food, refuel.

51:08.642 --> 51:10.342
It's just a bag.

51:13.275 --> 51:15.442
We can take a quick look,
all right.

51:15.576 --> 51:18.609
Come on. Come on.

51:20.175 --> 51:22.108
Okay, okay, okay.

51:53.776 --> 51:55.042
Let me see it.

51:59.642 --> 52:01.209
Go back now?

52:01.342 --> 52:03.542
You wanna open it or...?

52:05.275 --> 52:07.843
- You didn't even wanna look.
- Huh?

52:07.975 --> 52:09.843
He didn't wanna look.

52:09.975 --> 52:11.709
How... How are you so sure?

52:12.676 --> 52:14.909
Well, I wasn't.

52:15.042 --> 52:17.075
But it looked
like a plastic bag,

52:17.209 --> 52:20.476
and it was, so I guess
I was right about that.

52:22.609 --> 52:23.876
Damn it!

52:24.008 --> 52:25.409
We're out of gas.

52:25.542 --> 52:27.142
I was right
about that too. Shit!

52:27.275 --> 52:29.476
Maybe you didn't wanna look

52:29.609 --> 52:33.576
because you were sure
that it wasn't her.

52:33.709 --> 52:34.943
What?

52:35.075 --> 52:36.375
Wendy.

52:36.509 --> 52:38.642
I don't mind asking them
a few questions, okay,

52:38.776 --> 52:40.909
but let's not just start
accusing people...

52:41.042 --> 52:42.742
Wait, wait, wait, questions?

52:42.876 --> 52:44.075
What questions?

52:44.209 --> 52:46.975
For example,
how is the honeymoon going?

52:48.075 --> 52:49.476
Huh?

52:49.609 --> 52:53.042
Look, guys, I don't know
what you're talking about,

52:53.175 --> 52:54.442
but we're stranded out here.

52:54.576 --> 52:56.975
It's gonna take a long time
to row back.

52:57.108 --> 52:59.108
I think what my wife
is trying to say

52:59.242 --> 53:01.542
is that we just find it
a little ironic

53:01.676 --> 53:04.042
that you guys are trying
to have a kid

53:04.175 --> 53:07.476
and our kid goes missing.

53:07.609 --> 53:08.975
How do you know that?

53:09.609 --> 53:10.876
We found the IVF.

53:11.008 --> 53:12.709
If you have her,
just give her back to us.

53:12.843 --> 53:15.375
- You go through our shit?
- We won't say anything, I promise we won't.

53:15.509 --> 53:17.476
We're out here trying to help
and they're fucking accusing us!

53:17.609 --> 53:20.342
Calm down, Eric.
They're obviously going through a lot.

53:20.476 --> 53:23.409
You know, and just think, like,
you guys are newlyweds,

53:23.542 --> 53:25.876
but you've been trying
to have a kid for years.

53:26.008 --> 53:27.709
It just looks a little,
you know.

53:27.843 --> 53:29.609
Don't even answer that question!

53:29.742 --> 53:32.042
I'm gonna row us back myself,

53:32.175 --> 53:34.175
when we get back we're getting
the hell out of here.

53:34.309 --> 53:37.042
Fuck these people!
Get out of my way. Fuck you!

53:39.209 --> 53:40.742
I am so sorry.

53:41.709 --> 53:43.709
- You're not going anywhere.
- Jesus, fuck!

53:43.843 --> 53:45.642
- What?
- No, honey, I'm sorry.

53:45.776 --> 53:47.876
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna answer a couple of questions.

53:48.008 --> 53:50.476
You better get your wife in
check before someone gets hurt.

53:50.609 --> 53:53.075
Wendy, put the gun down.
She's not normally like this.

53:53.209 --> 53:54.809
- She's not a violent person.
- I feel it in my body.

53:54.943 --> 53:57.309
I feel it. I know you can feel it.
They have her.

53:57.442 --> 53:59.108
What are you talking about?

53:59.242 --> 54:00.909
We never said we were newlyweds.

54:01.042 --> 54:02.542
We've been married
for five years.

54:02.676 --> 54:04.776
We spent all of our money
trying to have a kid

54:04.909 --> 54:06.342
so we decided to take this trip,

54:06.476 --> 54:09.776
just focus on us,
and forget about having kids.

54:09.909 --> 54:12.375
Until you found our daughter

54:12.509 --> 54:14.542
and you thought
that you could have

54:14.676 --> 54:15.943
- one of your own.
- No!

54:16.075 --> 54:18.642
We would never do
something like that.

54:18.776 --> 54:20.008
You are lying.

54:20.142 --> 54:22.943
- This game is over, we're done!
- Paul!

54:23.075 --> 54:24.876
You protecting
your little girlfriend?

54:25.008 --> 54:26.409
What are you talking about?

54:26.542 --> 54:28.175
You thought I was sleeping?

54:28.309 --> 54:31.008
I watched you.
I watched you watch her.

54:31.142 --> 54:33.075
Oh, you're good.

54:33.209 --> 54:35.843
You like being watched, a lot.

54:35.975 --> 54:38.709
Maybe it's because my husband
could get me pregnant

54:38.843 --> 54:39.975
and hers can't.

54:40.108 --> 54:41.375
That's enough!

55:08.909 --> 55:10.209
Jesus!

55:10.342 --> 55:12.209
Wendy!

55:12.342 --> 55:13.509
Hey!

55:17.642 --> 55:19.275
Hey! Hey!

55:19.409 --> 55:21.943
Wendy! Wendy!

55:22.075 --> 55:23.442
God!

55:23.576 --> 55:24.442
You okay?

55:24.576 --> 55:25.709
Hang on to the boat!

55:25.843 --> 55:28.142
Oh, God, you're okay.

55:28.275 --> 55:30.342
Are you okay? Are you okay?

55:30.476 --> 55:32.142
Oh, God.

55:34.642 --> 55:36.642
- Where's Miranda?
- I don't know.

55:38.342 --> 55:39.742
I don't know.

55:49.075 --> 55:51.943
Okay, let's go, let's go.

55:52.075 --> 55:54.309
Let's go right now.

56:14.642 --> 56:15.609
Got a minute?

56:15.742 --> 56:17.442
Yep.

56:17.576 --> 56:18.609
What is it?

56:18.742 --> 56:20.409
FBI called again.

56:20.542 --> 56:22.776
Not their territory.
This ain't connected yet.

56:22.909 --> 56:25.742
What if it's connected
to the dead camper in the woods?

56:25.876 --> 56:28.309
- No proof of that.
- Look, John...

56:28.442 --> 56:30.108
this isn't looking good,
all right.

56:30.242 --> 56:33.275
I'm just saying,
maybe we can use some help.

56:34.342 --> 56:37.409
Who you working for? Huh?

56:45.275 --> 56:48.209
Rakes, get Tim Bradley
on the phone,

56:48.342 --> 56:51.242
tell him the situation,
get him down here.

57:02.709 --> 57:05.209
Anything you wanna tell me?

57:07.975 --> 57:11.342
Any detail come back in?

57:17.209 --> 57:19.242
Every piece
of information matters.

57:19.375 --> 57:20.609
Sheriff...

57:22.375 --> 57:25.375
we feel so helpless.

57:28.843 --> 57:31.175
Well, there's someone
I'd like you to talk to.

57:31.309 --> 57:33.375
I think he might be able
to help you.

57:35.075 --> 57:37.108
His name is Dr. Bradley.

57:37.843 --> 57:39.742
He's a grief counselor.

57:42.175 --> 57:44.509
We have nothing to grieve.

57:46.342 --> 57:49.442
Taylor is still out there.

57:50.342 --> 57:52.309
You said you would find her.

57:52.442 --> 57:57.409
You said
that you would find her.

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:14.542
You need to come see this.

01:01:21.108 --> 01:01:23.409
This mean anything to you?

01:01:27.142 --> 01:01:28.676
It's...

01:01:30.476 --> 01:01:31.342
it's Taylor's.

01:01:31.476 --> 01:01:33.542
It's Taylor's
favorite necklace.

01:01:33.676 --> 01:01:35.108
Where did you find it?

01:01:35.843 --> 01:01:37.075
Hudson's RV.

01:01:37.209 --> 01:01:40.809
Eric Hudson's been stabbed
multiple times.

01:01:40.943 --> 01:01:44.909
So at this point, high probability
your daughter's been abducted.

01:01:45.042 --> 01:01:48.075
We got an APB out
for his wife, Miranda.

01:01:49.409 --> 01:01:51.375
We'll get some answers.

01:01:58.676 --> 01:02:00.309
I had lied to you.

01:02:01.576 --> 01:02:04.142
I told you
I'd never lost a child.

01:02:04.943 --> 01:02:06.409
I lost one.

01:02:07.476 --> 01:02:09.008
My son.

01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:10.975
A few years back.

01:02:11.742 --> 01:02:13.008
Drug addiction.

01:02:14.509 --> 01:02:18.142
And it's a pain that no one
should ever go through.

01:02:19.476 --> 01:02:22.609
And the reason I can make sure
you don't have to.

01:02:23.876 --> 01:02:25.142
My word.

01:02:29.542 --> 01:02:30.576
Oh, my...

01:02:31.909 --> 01:02:34.943
What are we gonna tell him?
We gotta tell him something!

01:02:35.075 --> 01:02:37.242
They're wasting time looking
for Miranda.

01:02:37.375 --> 01:02:38.375
Yeah.

01:02:38.509 --> 01:02:41.242
They are not gonna find her.
She's dead.

01:02:41.375 --> 01:02:43.108
- Shh!
- How are they gonna find her?

01:02:43.242 --> 01:02:44.709
We don't know that for sure.

01:02:44.843 --> 01:02:47.843
Well, Eric's dead.

01:02:47.975 --> 01:02:49.576
Eric's dead.

01:02:49.709 --> 01:02:51.676
We are murderers.

01:02:51.809 --> 01:02:54.008
No, no, that was an accident.

01:02:54.142 --> 01:02:57.943
- No, once is an accident, twice?
- God damn it.

01:02:58.075 --> 01:02:59.943
What do you want me
to do, Wendy?

01:03:00.075 --> 01:03:04.075
- I don't know.
- Fuck, for all we know, they did do it! Right?

01:03:04.209 --> 01:03:06.542
- If they did it, where is she?
- I don't know!

01:03:06.676 --> 01:03:09.175
- Maybe they took her somewhere!
- Where is Taylor?

01:03:09.309 --> 01:03:11.709
Maybe they had an accomplice.
They hid her, okay.

01:03:11.843 --> 01:03:14.108
Or they gave her to somebody.

01:03:15.776 --> 01:03:18.509
We can't ask them now.

01:03:18.642 --> 01:03:21.975
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:03:25.375 --> 01:03:26.642
Jesus.

01:03:38.609 --> 01:03:40.342
Shut up.

01:03:52.409 --> 01:03:55.008
I saw you talking
to the sheriff.

01:03:56.108 --> 01:03:57.975
- So?
- So?

01:03:58.108 --> 01:04:00.209
Don't play games with me.

01:04:00.342 --> 01:04:02.576
I didn't say anything,
all right?

01:04:05.742 --> 01:04:09.042
- I'm scared, Tom.
- What are you scared of?

01:04:09.175 --> 01:04:11.008
Dead bodies keep popping up
all over.

01:04:11.142 --> 01:04:14.442
I don't like this, Tom,
and I need some answers.

01:04:14.576 --> 01:04:15.975
Like what?

01:04:16.108 --> 01:04:18.142
Did you kill those people?

01:04:18.275 --> 01:04:20.175
I've known you
since you were 14,

01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:23.509
took you in
when no one else wanted you,

01:04:23.642 --> 01:04:25.442
hired you, fed you...

01:04:25.576 --> 01:04:27.776
treated you like a son,
you're gonna ask me that?

01:04:27.909 --> 01:04:31.509
That's what I'm asking you,
Tom, 'cause I know you.

01:04:31.642 --> 01:04:32.975
I know all about you.

01:04:33.108 --> 01:04:34.476
I know everything.

01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:36.843
I didn't kill those people.

01:04:36.975 --> 01:04:39.275
Well, did you take
that little girl?

01:04:41.142 --> 01:04:43.742
Don't you ever insult me
like that again!

01:04:43.876 --> 01:04:45.275
You understand me?

01:04:46.108 --> 01:04:47.375
You understand me?

01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:49.375
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:50.642 --> 01:04:51.709
Here.

01:04:54.108 --> 01:04:56.075
Now get.

01:04:59.309 --> 01:05:01.175
Just don't drag me into
any of your shit!

01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:03.209
You're welcome!

01:05:33.309 --> 01:05:35.909
Taylor!

01:05:37.843 --> 01:05:39.476
Taylor!

01:05:41.876 --> 01:05:43.075
Taylor!

01:05:51.676 --> 01:05:53.108
Dinner's getting cold.

01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:55.876
How can you eat right now?

01:05:56.008 --> 01:05:59.742
Wendy, I haven't eaten
in three days, okay.

01:05:59.876 --> 01:06:03.209
I haven't slept in three days.

01:06:03.342 --> 01:06:07.943
And even if we do get Taylor
back, guess what?

01:06:08.075 --> 01:06:10.843
When the police find out
what we did,

01:06:10.975 --> 01:06:14.042
we're all going to jail, okay?

01:06:15.108 --> 01:06:20.242
So this, right now,
is all we've got.

01:06:22.108 --> 01:06:26.975
And I'm not gonna sit
around wasting it by worrying.

01:06:27.108 --> 01:06:28.242
All right?

01:06:28.375 --> 01:06:31.576
So please, come sit down.

01:06:31.709 --> 01:06:36.175
Why don't we just try to have a
semblance of a nice, normal night?

01:06:41.375 --> 01:06:44.042
You wanna watch a movie
after dinner?

01:06:56.909 --> 01:06:58.509
Ah.

01:07:22.409 --> 01:07:23.476
Hello?

01:07:38.509 --> 01:07:40.409
Hello?

01:08:18.776 --> 01:08:20.108
Hello?

01:08:33.975 --> 01:08:35.908
Oh! Okay.

01:08:36.042 --> 01:08:37.375
- We're closed.
- Yeah, I...

01:08:41.742 --> 01:08:43.375
Sorry.

01:08:43.509 --> 01:08:44.642
You scared me.

01:08:49.876 --> 01:08:52.042
Uh, I was...

01:08:52.175 --> 01:08:54.108
I had some...

01:08:54.242 --> 01:08:57.042
I'm sorry,
I already opened the chocolate.

01:09:01.475 --> 01:09:05.142
Be a dollar for the candy bar
plus the videos.

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:09.008
- I don't have a wallet.
- Of course.

01:09:10.943 --> 01:09:14.809
Write down what you take, time in and
time out, and I'll put it on your bill.

01:09:14.943 --> 01:09:16.609
So generous.

01:09:16.742 --> 01:09:18.075
Considering the circumstances.

01:09:18.209 --> 01:09:19.876
Fine, if it'll make
you feel better,

01:09:20.008 --> 01:09:21.542
I won't charge you
for the candy bar,

01:09:21.676 --> 01:09:24.075
but make sure
you bring those back.

01:09:25.709 --> 01:09:27.509
Will do.

01:09:30.008 --> 01:09:31.609
Hey!

01:09:32.442 --> 01:09:34.642
Sorry about your daughter.

01:10:12.909 --> 01:10:14.476
I rented out some movies.

01:10:14.609 --> 01:10:15.975
Well, that's great.

01:10:16.108 --> 01:10:18.943
So we can have a nice,
normal night of camping.

01:10:19.075 --> 01:10:21.008
Yeah, oh, what about this one?

01:10:21.142 --> 01:10:22.876
It's one of Taylor's favorites.

01:10:23.008 --> 01:10:26.409
It's where a daddy fish
loses a baby fish.

01:10:26.542 --> 01:10:30.742
Or, oh, yeah,
I got an action movie about abduction.

01:10:30.876 --> 01:10:33.509
Or... Oh, what about this one?

01:10:33.642 --> 01:10:35.642
This one flew
over the cuckoo's nest.

01:10:35.776 --> 01:10:38.409
That's one you can relate to,
isn't it, Paul?

01:10:38.542 --> 01:10:41.809
Or maybe we could go out
to the campfire

01:10:41.943 --> 01:10:48.442
and finally make those s'mores
you were talking about!

01:10:48.576 --> 01:10:50.042
Enough!

01:10:56.909 --> 01:10:58.576
Nice dinner.

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:22.442
Paul!

01:11:24.742 --> 01:11:25.876
Shut up.

01:11:26.008 --> 01:11:27.776
Let's have that glass
of wine, Paul!

01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:29.642
Fuck off!

01:11:31.175 --> 01:11:32.476
It's pretty good.

01:11:32.609 --> 01:11:34.576
Shut up, shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up,

01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:35.742
Paul!

01:11:41.375 --> 01:11:43.008
Lucky.

01:11:44.242 --> 01:11:45.876
Lucky, quiet.

01:11:47.576 --> 01:11:49.275
What, what, what?

01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:53.342
What are you barking for?

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:54.309
Come here.

01:12:00.909 --> 01:12:02.175
Yeah?

01:12:02.309 --> 01:12:04.776
- I'm sorry to bother you...
- Don't.

01:12:04.909 --> 01:12:08.843
Um, it's a beautiful night.

01:12:14.442 --> 01:12:18.042
- How are you doing today?
- Peachy.

01:12:18.175 --> 01:12:21.142
Sorry, I'm not too good
at talking to people.

01:12:21.275 --> 01:12:23.409
I seem to say the wrong things.

01:12:23.542 --> 01:12:28.409
I just wanted to say I really
hope you guys find your daughter.

01:12:28.542 --> 01:12:30.776
You know, alive.

01:12:30.909 --> 01:12:32.843
Okay.

01:12:32.975 --> 01:12:36.075
This is for you.

01:12:41.242 --> 01:12:44.442
Okay, thanks.

01:12:45.275 --> 01:12:47.309
Have a good night.

01:16:11.809 --> 01:16:13.142
Shit!

01:16:15.375 --> 01:16:18.409
Taylor, Taylor, honey!

01:16:18.542 --> 01:16:19.709
Hey!

01:16:19.843 --> 01:16:21.042
Hey, I found her!

01:16:21.175 --> 01:16:24.042
Hey, over here!

01:16:24.943 --> 01:16:26.175
Help!

01:16:27.042 --> 01:16:28.409
Come back to me, please!

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:30.742
Please, honey, please,
come back to me!

01:16:30.876 --> 01:16:31.843
Taylor!

01:16:31.975 --> 01:16:33.042
Honey, come back to me!

01:16:43.576 --> 01:16:45.342
Get inside.

01:16:51.342 --> 01:16:54.542
Looks like someone screwed the pooch.

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:57.542
Make sure you get a good shot
of those cuts right there.

01:16:57.676 --> 01:17:01.642
I wanna know, what the hell
is going on here, okay?

01:17:01.776 --> 01:17:04.075
Our daughter is still missing.

01:17:04.209 --> 01:17:06.342
You got some dead guy
in the woods over there.

01:17:06.476 --> 01:17:08.375
These guys are either dead
or missing,

01:17:08.509 --> 01:17:12.242
so please, tell me where the
hell everybody was this morning?

01:17:12.375 --> 01:17:14.776
It's Thanksgiving day.

01:17:14.909 --> 01:17:16.709
I pulled these men
from their tables.

01:17:16.843 --> 01:17:20.642
Everyone else we got is out in the
woods looking for your daughter.

01:17:21.909 --> 01:17:24.509
I forgot about that, Jesus.

01:17:24.642 --> 01:17:26.342
How's your wife?

01:17:26.476 --> 01:17:28.309
How the hell do you think
she is, man?

01:17:28.442 --> 01:17:30.709
Somebody murdered our dog!

01:17:30.843 --> 01:17:32.075
You don't know that.

01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:33.476
It could be an animal.

01:17:33.609 --> 01:17:35.242
An animal?

01:17:35.375 --> 01:17:38.975
Listen, last night,
my wife said she saw

01:17:39.108 --> 01:17:41.175
that creepy kid Justin
doing drugs.

01:17:41.309 --> 01:17:45.108
And this morning, I hear him, he's buzzing
all over the campground on his Gator.

01:17:45.242 --> 01:17:49.709
- Drugs, where?
- Doing drugs in that van back there that he lives in, okay.

01:17:49.843 --> 01:17:53.476
He comes to my wife last night, and he
hands her a chocolate bar, all right.

01:17:53.609 --> 01:17:55.576
Acting strange,
stranger than usual.

01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:58.242
So, you know, she follows him.
She sees him.

01:17:58.375 --> 01:18:00.342
He's smoking something
out of a glass pipe.

01:18:00.476 --> 01:18:02.676
We'll bring him in,
and we'll talk to him.

01:18:02.809 --> 01:18:05.876
I think it's time for you and Mrs.
Michaelson, maybe you go to a hotel.

01:18:06.008 --> 01:18:09.275
A hotel? We're not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere

01:18:09.409 --> 01:18:14.242
until my daughter is back here
with me safely!

01:18:23.975 --> 01:18:24.975
Bag it up.

01:18:25.108 --> 01:18:26.375
You got it.

01:18:27.876 --> 01:18:31.476
Forensics found a hair
under Eric Hudson's ring.

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:34.642
Well, their records are clean.

01:18:35.843 --> 01:18:37.676
Find the wife.

01:18:37.809 --> 01:18:39.375
FBI called again!

01:18:39.509 --> 01:18:40.542
Not now!

01:18:42.209 --> 01:18:44.876
Wendy, open the door.

01:18:47.809 --> 01:18:50.142
Hey, Wendy!

01:18:52.275 --> 01:18:55.642
Wendy, open the door
or I'll break it down!

01:18:57.242 --> 01:19:00.409
Hey, you okay in there?

01:19:02.075 --> 01:19:04.008
Yeah.

01:19:04.142 --> 01:19:06.509
I just need to sleep.

01:19:26.075 --> 01:19:29.042
Maybe I should have
a lawyer present.

01:19:29.909 --> 01:19:31.642
Something you need a lawyer for?

01:19:32.809 --> 01:19:35.975
No, I just don't feel
real comfortable right now.

01:19:36.108 --> 01:19:37.909
Well, you're not arrested.

01:19:38.042 --> 01:19:39.642
We're just talking.

01:19:39.776 --> 01:19:41.476
You and me.

01:19:44.375 --> 01:19:45.909
Anything you wanna tell me?

01:19:46.042 --> 01:19:48.409
I don't know nothing.

01:19:48.542 --> 01:19:50.609
Don't know nothing
about that dog?

01:19:50.742 --> 01:19:52.175
What dog?

01:19:53.542 --> 01:19:56.609
Okay, okay.

01:19:56.742 --> 01:19:58.975
Well I know some things.

01:20:00.142 --> 01:20:02.309
That your mama left you
when you were 10.

01:20:02.442 --> 01:20:04.642
You never knew your daddy.

01:20:04.776 --> 01:20:09.342
In and out of juvie for years
and years, drugs.

01:20:10.375 --> 01:20:12.609
Drugs, drugs, drugs,
petty theft.

01:20:12.742 --> 01:20:15.676
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

01:20:25.175 --> 01:20:29.509
I got a warrant for that van of
yours, what do you think I'd find?

01:20:29.642 --> 01:20:32.843
- Drugs.
- I don't do drugs anymore. I'm clean.

01:20:32.975 --> 01:20:36.075
- You're lying. You're lying, Justin.
- I don't. No, I'm not.

01:20:36.209 --> 01:20:38.442
Drugs make you lie.
That's what they do.

01:20:38.576 --> 01:20:41.108
They keep you
from being yourself.

01:20:41.242 --> 01:20:43.943
Make you do things
you normally wouldn't do.

01:20:44.075 --> 01:20:45.375
All right?

01:20:49.975 --> 01:20:52.509
My son was an addict.

01:20:52.642 --> 01:20:54.042
I didn't even know it.

01:20:54.175 --> 01:20:55.975
That's how good a liar he was.

01:20:57.776 --> 01:21:01.108
Time I found out, it's too late.

01:21:02.342 --> 01:21:03.843
I don't want that for you.

01:21:03.975 --> 01:21:05.975
I'm here to help you.

01:21:06.108 --> 01:21:08.476
But I need you to help me first.

01:21:08.609 --> 01:21:13.175
Now what happened
to the little girl?

01:21:13.309 --> 01:21:15.509
- Yeah, you know something.
- No I don't. No I don't.

01:21:15.642 --> 01:21:18.042
Whether you saw, whether you
overheard something.

01:21:18.175 --> 01:21:20.676
You were all around there.
Come on, now.

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:23.275
What, you're trying
to protect someone? Is that it?

01:21:23.409 --> 01:21:26.642
Miranda Hudson, is that it? Huh?

01:21:27.409 --> 01:21:28.676
Mr. Henry?

01:21:28.809 --> 01:21:32.142
I told you... I told you,
I don't know nothing, all right?

01:21:32.275 --> 01:21:33.776
I don't know nothing.

01:21:33.909 --> 01:21:36.909
You don't know nothing about
those two dead people neither?

01:21:37.042 --> 01:21:39.075
No, no.

01:21:39.209 --> 01:21:41.175
Well, let me let you in
on a little secret.

01:21:41.309 --> 01:21:43.509
We got a hair of the killer.

01:21:43.642 --> 01:21:46.975
It's only a matter of time
before we know who he is.

01:21:48.609 --> 01:21:51.776
You might wanna look up
that lawyer.

01:21:51.909 --> 01:21:53.375
You might need that.

01:21:58.042 --> 01:21:59.642
Tell you what...

01:22:01.108 --> 01:22:03.142
give him a card.

01:22:03.275 --> 01:22:05.442
Call me, you know where I am.

01:22:05.576 --> 01:22:07.709
Maybe something
will come back to you.

01:22:20.943 --> 01:22:22.409
Baker.

01:22:24.008 --> 01:22:25.476
What?

01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:27.409
Shit.

01:22:39.909 --> 01:22:41.442
She gonna be okay?

01:22:41.576 --> 01:22:43.909
She swallowed a whole bottle
of sleeping pills.

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:47.275
We just pumped her. She is gonna be
okay, she just needs some rest.

01:22:47.409 --> 01:22:50.209
Her husband's in there
with her right now.

01:22:55.375 --> 01:22:59.108
I think we'll see that grief
counselor now, sheriff.

01:23:02.576 --> 01:23:06.442
I want you to know
you're not alone in this.

01:23:06.576 --> 01:23:08.476
You have each other.

01:23:08.609 --> 01:23:13.209
It's important
that you lean on one another

01:23:13.342 --> 01:23:15.742
in times of duress.

01:23:17.542 --> 01:23:22.409
There are five stages
to losing a loved one.

01:23:22.542 --> 01:23:25.975
Although you haven't officially
lost your daughter forever,

01:23:26.108 --> 01:23:29.909
you are still experiencing
a sense of loss,

01:23:30.075 --> 01:23:32.642
and going through those stages.

01:23:33.876 --> 01:23:35.742
Denial,

01:23:35.876 --> 01:23:38.509
anger, bargaining.

01:23:38.642 --> 01:23:42.776
I'll do anything
to get my daughter back.

01:23:42.909 --> 01:23:46.309
Placing blame on others,

01:23:46.442 --> 01:23:49.542
<i>and then moving
into depression.</i>

01:23:49.676 --> 01:23:53.075
<i>You might fluctuate
between those stages</i>

01:23:53.209 --> 01:23:57.209
<i>until you arrive
at the final stage.</i>

01:23:59.008 --> 01:24:00.609
<i>Acceptance.</i>

01:24:02.309 --> 01:24:04.275
<i>That last stage,</i>

01:24:04.409 --> 01:24:07.975
<i>well, in your situation,
staying hopeful</i>

01:24:08.108 --> 01:24:11.476
<i>and supportive of each other.</i>

01:24:13.843 --> 01:24:19.642
<i>In many couples,
a wedge can be created.</i>

01:24:19.776 --> 01:24:21.142
<i>They can blame each other.</i>

01:24:21.275 --> 01:24:23.108
<i>It can erode the marriage.</i>

01:24:23.242 --> 01:24:27.442
<i>But by leaning on
each other for support,</i>

01:24:27.576 --> 01:24:30.075
<i>the relationship
can strengthen.</i>

01:24:32.442 --> 01:24:34.709
<i>You must not give up hope,</i>

01:24:34.843 --> 01:24:40.209
<i>but you also must not get stuck
in those other stages.</i>

01:24:40.342 --> 01:24:44.142
<i>It'll lead you
into a downward spiral.</i>

01:24:46.209 --> 01:24:51.042
<i>It's a fine line
between denial and hope.</i>

01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:56.975
<i>Acceptance means letting go.</i>

01:24:59.375 --> 01:25:05.642
<i>Letting go of that
which is not in your control.</i>

01:25:48.142 --> 01:25:49.509
Hey, whoa!

01:25:51.275 --> 01:25:53.843
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

01:25:53.975 --> 01:25:58.175
Yeah, just returning tapes,
okay?

01:27:12.909 --> 01:27:14.609
Hello?

01:31:30.209 --> 01:31:32.175
<i>Come sit on the bed.</i>

01:31:32.309 --> 01:31:35.209
<i>No, I don't want to.</i>

01:31:36.442 --> 01:31:39.142
<i>I'm not gonna hurt
you, darling.</i>

01:31:39.275 --> 01:31:41.709
<i>You don't need to be scared.</i>

01:31:43.142 --> 01:31:44.576
<i>Come on.</i>

01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:46.509
<i>Come sit next to me.</i>

01:32:03.008 --> 01:32:04.975
Wendy!

01:32:42.809 --> 01:32:44.342
Oh, shit.

01:33:43.876 --> 01:33:45.975
Have you seen my wife?

01:33:46.108 --> 01:33:47.676
Nope.

01:33:48.909 --> 01:33:50.042
I'm gonna grab some sugar.

01:33:50.175 --> 01:33:52.042
We're closed.

01:33:53.909 --> 01:33:55.576
It'll take you like a minute.

01:33:56.676 --> 01:33:58.442
Make it quick.

01:34:04.876 --> 01:34:06.676
Take it, it's on me.

01:34:08.876 --> 01:34:10.108
Thanks.

01:34:11.409 --> 01:34:13.642
Hey, you sure
you haven't seen Wendy?

01:34:14.975 --> 01:34:16.108
Nope.

01:34:16.242 --> 01:34:17.943
She must've dropped
'em off earlier.

01:34:18.075 --> 01:34:19.375
Oh, yeah?

01:34:19.509 --> 01:34:20.609
Yeah.

01:34:20.742 --> 01:34:22.709
Yeah? About when was that?

01:34:22.843 --> 01:34:25.309
I don't know, we were closed.

01:34:26.576 --> 01:34:28.175
Oh, yeah.

01:34:29.309 --> 01:34:31.509
Thanks for the sugar.

01:36:12.509 --> 01:36:14.309
At around 11 p.m. last night,

01:36:14.442 --> 01:36:17.709
the RV park owner Mr. Tom Henry
was killed

01:36:17.843 --> 01:36:20.209
after attacking Mrs. Michaelson
in the back room

01:36:20.342 --> 01:36:24.309
of the RV front office, which
contained child pornography.

01:36:24.442 --> 01:36:26.476
<i>At this time,
we believe that Mr. Henry</i>

01:36:26.609 --> 01:36:29.075
<i>was behind the disappearance
of Taylor Michaelson.</i>

01:36:29.209 --> 01:36:31.375
We speculate
that he may be involved

01:36:31.509 --> 01:36:33.542
in an underground
child pornography ring

01:36:33.676 --> 01:36:36.275
<i>and may be involved
in the murder of Eric Hudson</i>

01:36:36.409 --> 01:36:38.975
<i>and the disappearance
of his wife, Miranda Hudson.</i>

01:36:39.108 --> 01:36:42.809
We still do not know the
whereabouts of Taylor Michaelson.

01:36:42.943 --> 01:36:46.375
<i>We fear that Mr. Henry has
taken the secret to his grave.</i>

01:36:46.509 --> 01:36:49.642
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Michaelson have
asked for privacy during this time</i>

01:36:49.776 --> 01:36:53.242
<i>and are declining
any further press statements.</i>

01:36:53.375 --> 01:36:55.476
<i>We ask that if you have
any information</i>

01:36:55.609 --> 01:36:58.509
<i>regarding Taylor Michaelson,
that you please come forward</i>

01:36:58.642 --> 01:37:01.975
<i>and contact the sheriff's
department, thank you.</i>

01:37:05.576 --> 01:37:09.375
Want you to know
this investigation isn't over.

01:37:14.142 --> 01:37:19.309
I will continue to work around the
clock to get your daughter back.

01:37:21.776 --> 01:37:22.943
Thank you.

01:37:23.075 --> 01:37:24.843
We're pulling the teams
from the lake.

01:37:24.975 --> 01:37:26.476
I don't think she's there.

01:37:26.609 --> 01:37:29.342
Gotta focus our manpower
on the leader of that tape ring.

01:37:29.476 --> 01:37:31.642
I'm hoping there's
some kind of connection,

01:37:31.776 --> 01:37:34.008
maybe find out where she is.

01:37:35.409 --> 01:37:39.642
Just got off the phone
with the FBI, filled them in.

01:37:39.776 --> 01:37:43.075
They're sending someone up from
their field office up north.

01:37:43.209 --> 01:37:45.809
Should be here
tomorrow afternoon.

01:37:45.943 --> 01:37:47.175
Makes sense.

01:37:50.309 --> 01:37:52.242
Try to get some sleep.

01:37:59.975 --> 01:38:01.876
You find anything
in Justin's van?

01:38:02.008 --> 01:38:03.576
Nope.

01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:05.175
Kid's staying quiet.

01:38:06.609 --> 01:38:08.142
Well...

01:38:09.108 --> 01:38:11.042
we have the FBI.

01:38:11.175 --> 01:38:14.375
Try to throw scare
on him tomorrow.

01:38:14.509 --> 01:38:16.409
I'm sorry, John.

01:38:17.375 --> 01:38:19.108
I know you wanted this one.

01:38:40.209 --> 01:38:42.242
What are you doing?

01:38:48.843 --> 01:38:51.209
She's not coming back.

01:38:55.242 --> 01:38:57.108
We gotta stop
torturing ourselves.

01:38:57.242 --> 01:39:00.309
Wait... Give... Give me the box.

01:39:03.309 --> 01:39:04.709
No.

01:39:04.843 --> 01:39:06.476
Wendy.

01:39:10.275 --> 01:39:12.409
I can't do this anymore.

01:39:14.442 --> 01:39:15.175
I can't.

01:39:15.309 --> 01:39:17.409
I can't look at this stuff.

01:39:17.542 --> 01:39:21.142
Everywhere I look,
I've been seeing her...

01:39:21.876 --> 01:39:25.042
and not you.
You understand?

01:39:25.175 --> 01:39:28.108
You just wanna throw away every
memory of her, you wanna forget?

01:39:28.242 --> 01:39:29.809
- No, no, no.
- Is that what you want, Paul?

01:39:29.943 --> 01:39:32.442
- Just give me the box. Give me the box!
- No. Wendy, Wendy!

01:39:32.576 --> 01:39:35.642
- Give me this box!
- Wendy, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.

01:39:35.776 --> 01:39:37.709
I-I...

01:39:39.175 --> 01:39:41.576
I can't do it.

01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:43.509
No.

01:39:43.642 --> 01:39:45.242
No.

01:39:47.442 --> 01:39:50.975
I'm not playing
this game anymore, so...

01:39:52.542 --> 01:39:54.075
I'm sorry.

01:40:03.542 --> 01:40:04.542
Taylor's gone.

01:40:06.008 --> 01:40:07.709
Not coming back.

01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:11.742
We need to accept that.

01:40:13.776 --> 01:40:17.476
We need to accept that.

01:43:01.209 --> 01:43:04.108
<i>This is Sheriff
Baker, leave a message.</i>

01:43:12.909 --> 01:43:14.742
Marianne!

01:45:13.075 --> 01:45:14.476
Hello.

01:45:14.609 --> 01:45:17.609
Rakes, we do a background check
on the Michaelsons?

01:45:17.742 --> 01:45:19.209
Yeah, records were clean.

01:45:19.342 --> 01:45:22.843
<i>Dad was a decorated veteran,
nothing else came up, why?</i>

01:45:22.975 --> 01:45:24.108
What about the kid?

01:45:24.242 --> 01:45:27.209
The kid, why would we?

01:45:27.342 --> 01:45:29.476
I mean, I didn't think
she'd have any arrests.

01:45:29.609 --> 01:45:32.242
I'm looking at a picture here
of Mrs. Michaelson

01:45:32.375 --> 01:45:33.943
about nine months pregnant,

01:45:34.075 --> 01:45:35.943
in the background
is the Twin Towers.

01:45:36.075 --> 01:45:37.409
So?

01:45:37.542 --> 01:45:40.776
So the Twin Towers went down
17 years ago.

01:45:40.909 --> 01:45:44.542
So how could Taylor Michaelson
possibly be 10 years old?

01:45:47.676 --> 01:45:50.676
On that missing persons form,
there's an emergency contact.

01:45:50.809 --> 01:45:51.975
I believe it's his brother.

01:45:52.108 --> 01:45:55.375
- <i>Get a hold of him.</i>
- Shit. Shit!

01:45:56.676 --> 01:46:00.075
<i>Taylor accidentally drowned
in Wolf River Harbor, Canada,</i>

01:46:00.209 --> 01:46:02.609
<i>six years ago
while on an RV camping trip.</i>

01:46:02.742 --> 01:46:06.676
<i>They were in therapy for a
while, but they stopped going.</i>

01:46:06.809 --> 01:46:09.108
<i>They have these shared
delusional episodes</i>

01:46:09.242 --> 01:46:11.576
<i>where they both think
Taylor's still alive.</i>

01:46:11.709 --> 01:46:14.275
<i>It's a syndrome called
folie à deux.</i>

01:46:14.409 --> 01:46:16.609
<i>Sometimes one will be more
in it than the other.</i>

01:46:16.742 --> 01:46:19.142
<i>I mean, they usually just play
this game at home.</i>

01:46:19.275 --> 01:46:21.342
<i>Making breakfast for her,
talking to her.</i>

01:46:21.476 --> 01:46:26.375
<i>The worst it ever got was they took her to
school one day, but no one ever got hurt.</i>

01:46:26.509 --> 01:46:29.809
<i>I thought it was their way to cope,
to keep their marriage together.</i>

01:46:29.943 --> 01:46:32.542
<i>You know, I mean, they can
function in the real world,</i>

01:46:32.676 --> 01:46:35.342
<i>both have good jobs,
so I just told my wife</i>

01:46:35.476 --> 01:46:37.542
<i>to leave them alone
if it helps them.</i>

01:46:37.676 --> 01:46:40.275
Hey, forensics got a match
on that DNA sample found

01:46:40.409 --> 01:46:42.275
in Eric Hudson's ring.
Paul Michaelson's.

01:46:42.409 --> 01:46:43.843
<i>What's happening?
Is everything okay?</i>

01:46:59.943 --> 01:47:01.576
Police, open up!

01:47:03.175 --> 01:47:05.175
- Can I help you?
- There was a couple parked

01:47:05.309 --> 01:47:07.042
in that RV spot,
you see anything?

01:47:07.175 --> 01:47:10.342
Yeah, there was an RV
when we first got here, but...

01:47:10.476 --> 01:47:11.476
but they left.

01:47:11.609 --> 01:47:12.576
You see anyone else?

01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:13.642
Groundskeeper, anyone?

01:47:13.776 --> 01:47:15.008
No, no one else was around

01:47:15.142 --> 01:47:16.742
and there was no one
at the front desk.

01:47:16.876 --> 01:47:19.576
Should we be worried?
Are these people dangerous?

01:47:21.542 --> 01:47:23.142
Where's your kid?

01:47:23.275 --> 01:47:25.409
What?
Where's your kid?

01:47:25.542 --> 01:47:27.342
She was out by the swing set.

01:47:27.476 --> 01:47:30.008
Cindy! Cindy!

01:47:30.142 --> 01:47:33.843
- Cindy! Cindy! Cindy!
- Cindy! Oh!

01:47:33.975 --> 01:47:35.843
Cindy! Cindy!

01:47:35.975 --> 01:47:37.309
I'm right here, Mama!

01:47:37.442 --> 01:47:38.476
Oh, God!

01:47:39.809 --> 01:47:42.142
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

01:47:48.142 --> 01:47:52.342
<i>There are five
stages to losing a loved one.</i>

01:47:53.909 --> 01:47:55.409
<i>Denial.</i>

01:47:55.542 --> 01:47:58.542
<i>Everywhere I look,
I've been seeing her.</i>

01:48:00.809 --> 01:48:02.209
<i>Anger.</i>

01:48:02.342 --> 01:48:04.409
- Fuck!
- We don't have anything, Paul!

01:48:04.542 --> 01:48:07.209
Taylor is the only reason
I'm with you! She is the glue!

01:48:07.342 --> 01:48:10.609
What do we have without her?

01:48:10.742 --> 01:48:11.809
Enough!

01:48:11.943 --> 01:48:13.209
<i>Bargaining.</i>

01:48:13.342 --> 01:48:14.975
You understand
that I would do anything

01:48:15.108 --> 01:48:16.275
<i>to keep that from happening.</i>

01:48:16.409 --> 01:48:19.142
I'm not gonna lose both of you.

01:48:19.275 --> 01:48:21.342
<i>Placing blame on others.</i>

01:48:21.476 --> 01:48:23.309
That's Taylor's favorite
necklace.

01:48:27.609 --> 01:48:31.142
<i>Moving into depression.</i>

01:48:34.108 --> 01:48:38.175
<i>It might fluctuate
between those stages.</i>

We have to tell them the truth.

01:48:40.175 --> 01:48:41.843
I'm not gonna play
this game anymore.

01:48:41.975 --> 01:48:43.175
We're murderers, Paul.

<i>You must not give up hope,</i>

01:48:45.442 --> 01:48:48.476
<i>but you also must not get stuck
