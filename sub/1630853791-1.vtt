WEBVTT

03:07.667 --> 03:08.708
I'll be late...

04:27.708 --> 04:28.625
So. Let's go!

05:18.500 --> 05:19.375
Good morning.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.042
Good morning, Taras.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.167
- Good morning!
- Good afternoon!

05:32.875 --> 05:33.875
Good morning!

05:36.792 --> 05:37.875
Good...

05:40.250 --> 05:41.083
Good afternoon.

05:44.583 --> 05:45.667
Good morning!

05:49.500 --> 05:51.208
- Is that my journal?
- Yes, take it.

05:51.292 --> 05:52.833
Mykola, you have something on your cheek.

05:52.917 --> 05:56.708
Yanukovych refused to sign
an agreement with the EU

05:56.792 --> 05:58.958
and set a course
for improving relations with Russia.

05:59.042 --> 06:01.708
The largest protest took place
on Maidan in Kyiv,

06:01.792 --> 06:05.625
the special forces killed
more than 100 protesters.

06:05.708 --> 06:07.042
Look, a sniper...

06:13.625 --> 06:16.750
President of Ukraine,
Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia,

06:16.833 --> 06:18.708
leaving his post as Commander-in-Chief.

06:18.792 --> 06:20.208
Crimea was completely captured

06:20.292 --> 06:22.875
and taken under the control
of the Russian Federation.

06:22.958 --> 06:26.292
CRIMEA

07:22.083 --> 07:25.417
Velocity is a physical quantity

07:26.375 --> 07:27.958
that characterizes the motion

07:28.542 --> 07:33.000
and distance that
an object travels per unit of time.

07:33.667 --> 07:36.375
The velocity is calculated

07:36.875 --> 07:41.000
by the formula V=S/t.

07:41.667 --> 07:44.417
Where V is the speed...

07:44.500 --> 07:47.500
- Are you a moron?
- Shut your mouth, faggot!

07:48.625 --> 07:49.583
Ivan...

07:51.250 --> 07:52.083
S is distance.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.750
And t is time.

08:15.042 --> 08:16.958
Can you hit in the same place again?

08:17.042 --> 08:18.833
RESET TIMER?

08:34.292 --> 08:35.958
0.9 seconds.

08:36.458 --> 08:38.625
I measured a distance of seven meters.

08:43.292 --> 08:46.833
Ivan, what is the speed?

08:50.958 --> 08:52.833
Taras...

08:54.375 --> 08:55.875
7.8 meters per second.

08:55.958 --> 08:56.833
Yes.

08:57.875 --> 08:59.667
It was at this speed

09:01.583 --> 09:03.750
that Ivan spat out a piece of paper.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.083
Well, Ivan...

09:13.167 --> 09:17.375
if the time is not 0.9, but 0.7

09:18.500 --> 09:19.917
at the same distance...

09:20.625 --> 09:21.917
What would the speed be?

09:22.667 --> 09:25.708
Write the answer on the board.

09:49.250 --> 09:50.208
Is there an answer?

10:02.958 --> 10:05.667
Now it's clear
what you are distracted by...

10:26.500 --> 10:27.417
Goodbye.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.042
Goodbye, Taras.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.000
Listen, digger...

10:35.917 --> 10:36.833
I'm sorry?

10:38.667 --> 10:41.708
You're a stranger here, get out.

10:56.292 --> 10:57.208
Lyosha, are you ready?

10:57.958 --> 10:58.792
Yes.

11:00.333 --> 11:03.458
The Voronenko family
are the first eco-settlers in Donbas.

11:03.542 --> 11:07.167
A year ago,
they registered a two-hectare plot of land

11:07.250 --> 11:08.917
near Horlivka
and moved to live in a field.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.958
Mykola has three higher education degrees,
mathematician, physicist, and ecologist.

11:14.042 --> 11:16.708
Explain what caused
you to take such a radical step?

11:17.792 --> 11:21.458
As an ecologist, I understand
that difficult times await us.

11:22.208 --> 11:26.292
Only by changing the harmful way
of life to an ecological one,

11:27.250 --> 11:30.417
can we have a chance
to save the planet and ourselves.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.333
How long do you plan to live here?

11:33.583 --> 11:37.083
We want to have and raise a child here.

11:37.167 --> 11:38.750
Is your wife pregnant?

11:38.833 --> 11:39.667
Yes.

11:40.958 --> 11:44.625
This means
everything will work out just fine.

11:46.292 --> 11:47.583
Tell me, what is this sign?

11:49.167 --> 11:51.083
This is our ancestral sign.

11:52.708 --> 11:54.792
And what does it mean?

11:55.833 --> 11:57.125
Paw of a white raven.

11:57.708 --> 11:58.667
Will you tell me?

12:02.667 --> 12:05.042
- This is... an ancient...
- Get the microphone closer.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Let me hold it.

12:08.917 --> 12:09.958
...legend...

12:11.333 --> 12:15.458
Raven created the world
out of darkness, waving his wings.

12:16.833 --> 12:19.625
And the world is
a black ocean with a shore,

12:20.417 --> 12:22.375
where people will soon come to live.

12:25.083 --> 12:28.000
The raven, feeling pity for the people,

12:28.083 --> 12:30.875
turns the ocean's salty water
into fresh water and food,

12:31.708 --> 12:33.042
but in return...

12:34.792 --> 12:37.000
sacrifices its snow-white feathers.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.375
Thank you.

12:43.125 --> 12:44.250
Lesha, stop.

12:44.333 --> 12:46.875
Come on in, now I'll show you inside...

12:47.708 --> 12:48.625
And this is a windmill.

12:49.292 --> 12:52.250
I can tell you later about it,
by the way, I made it myself.

12:58.417 --> 13:00.542
Shall we start with a dynamo machine?

13:03.333 --> 13:04.833
I'll show you how it works...

13:12.208 --> 13:13.042
See?

13:13.542 --> 13:18.292
Lyosha, film just a few more details
and these sketches.

13:35.375 --> 13:38.417
And you're not afraid to give birth here?

13:43.125 --> 13:44.125
No, I'm not afraid.

13:45.500 --> 13:46.375
Hmm...

13:51.417 --> 13:52.292
Lena,

13:53.083 --> 13:55.000
- I hope we are done?
- Yes, we're done.

13:55.583 --> 13:59.000
- I haven't shown you everything yet--
- Nikolai, thank you, we've had enough.

14:08.125 --> 14:09.458
Two crazy people.

14:18.333 --> 14:19.375
Something fell out.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.167
We do not throw trash here.

14:30.333 --> 14:31.292
Goodbye.

14:32.333 --> 14:33.167
Let's go.

14:38.042 --> 14:38.875
Don't worry,

14:40.000 --> 14:41.667
someday everything
will come back to normal.

15:04.292 --> 15:08.125
Come with me, my dear love

15:08.208 --> 15:12.292
To a place with shining stars

15:12.375 --> 15:16.333
There are rivers, mountains live on love

15:16.417 --> 15:20.333
The birds sing for us

15:20.417 --> 15:24.667
Your eyes are shining like emeralds

15:24.750 --> 15:28.375
And disappeared
In the misfortune of summer

15:28.458 --> 15:34.667
I will give you the whole world

15:34.750 --> 15:38.667
And a daughter with the name Nastya

15:38.750 --> 15:44.250
I will give you the whole world

15:44.333 --> 15:46.625
And a daughter with the name...

15:48.625 --> 15:51.167
Nastya...

16:03.958 --> 16:05.250
This is for you from us.

16:12.667 --> 16:13.792
Your Little Angel.

16:15.792 --> 16:17.333
Will protect you.

16:53.583 --> 16:55.125
Buriy, we pass the line.

16:56.125 --> 16:57.958
Confirmed. Chevrons.

17:29.792 --> 17:36.792
CAUTION!
STATE BORDER OF UKRAINE. NO PASSAGE.

17:58.500 --> 18:03.208
Get up, be fast!

18:03.292 --> 18:05.000
Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming...

18:09.375 --> 18:10.250
Bye.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.542
Oh, a normal engine!

18:24.250 --> 18:25.500
Flying!

18:25.583 --> 18:27.375
I'm flying...

19:43.500 --> 19:45.167
Yes, everything was canceled.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.167
No, I don't know...

19:47.875 --> 19:49.625
Maybe it won't be...

19:51.000 --> 19:52.417
Yes, I'll close it.

19:59.875 --> 20:01.458
This morning, an unknown bus stopped

20:01.542 --> 20:04.125
near the Horlivka Police Department
in the Donetsk region.

20:04.208 --> 20:07.083
It is also noted that
armed militants in balaclavas

20:07.167 --> 20:09.792
and pro-Russian activists

20:09.875 --> 20:13.292
continue to maintain the buildings
of regional state administrations

20:13.375 --> 20:15.167
in Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, and Donetsk.

20:17.583 --> 20:18.500
And...

20:19.208 --> 20:21.708
It just became clear
that special forces of GUR

20:21.792 --> 20:24.083
of the Russian Federation took part

20:24.167 --> 20:28.250
in the capture
of the Rada Verkhovna of Crimea.

21:00.708 --> 21:02.667
Take your hands off of her!

21:04.875 --> 21:05.917
Who are you?

21:10.500 --> 21:11.667
Bitch!

21:16.083 --> 21:17.625
What are you doing here, khokhlyara?

21:18.958 --> 21:20.875
I'm a teacher, I live here.

21:26.625 --> 21:27.958
Are you a pacifist or something?

21:30.750 --> 21:32.875
- Who is he?
- My husband.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.083
In Russian, fuck, just talk!

21:35.917 --> 21:36.750
Husband...

21:36.833 --> 21:39.500
Don't touch her, she is pregnant!

21:40.833 --> 21:41.958
And what is this?

21:42.042 --> 21:43.375
Those are my drawings.

21:43.917 --> 21:46.958
Look at her face, she's definitely a spy!

21:56.333 --> 21:57.167
Stand!

22:01.125 --> 22:02.833
Don't squeal!

23:11.875 --> 23:12.875
Everyone, let's go.

23:14.125 --> 23:15.083
What about him?

23:15.167 --> 23:16.167
We are leaving, I said.

23:21.250 --> 23:22.083
Bitch!

23:36.708 --> 23:37.833
Fuck!

23:43.792 --> 23:45.042
Get in the car quickly.

23:51.333 --> 23:54.792
Please don't die...

23:54.875 --> 23:56.167
Don't die, I'm here...

23:56.250 --> 24:00.208
I'm here with you. No, no...

24:00.708 --> 24:01.708
No!

25:58.125 --> 25:59.000
Local?

26:02.042 --> 26:02.958
Documents?

26:07.708 --> 26:08.583
In the bag.

26:16.250 --> 26:17.125
Who is she?

26:20.042 --> 26:20.917
Wife.

26:27.125 --> 26:28.625
Mykola Voronenko...

26:33.667 --> 26:34.833
Looks like he is ours.

28:25.625 --> 28:26.458
Come on.

29:15.333 --> 29:17.833
I don't care what happened there!

29:18.458 --> 29:20.750
Why the fuck is he here?

29:21.417 --> 29:24.417
So, I should have left him
in the middle of the field?

29:24.500 --> 29:27.583
I do not understand.
And if it's their spy?

29:27.667 --> 29:29.292
Have you thought about that?

29:29.375 --> 29:31.708
Well, of course,
you haven't thought about it.

29:31.792 --> 29:34.875
Your head just doesn't work that way.

29:34.958 --> 29:36.333
But you are clearly not aware of that.

29:38.500 --> 29:42.833
So, listen to me carefully.
Take him away from here as far as...

29:44.167 --> 29:45.167
Stop...

29:45.667 --> 29:48.000
Did you blindfold him
when you drove him to us?

29:50.375 --> 29:52.625
What? Do you have no brain at all?

29:53.917 --> 29:57.458
You leaked our base to him, you idiot!

29:58.208 --> 30:00.750
Should I shoot him now?

30:00.833 --> 30:03.792
Ah, go away... you motherfucker!

30:05.833 --> 30:06.667
Skinny,

30:09.375 --> 30:10.667
what did I tell you?

30:11.500 --> 30:13.708
Go to the toilet
with a weapon in your hand!

30:13.792 --> 30:14.792
That's right!

30:15.458 --> 30:18.417
Why are you reaching for your gun?

30:19.125 --> 30:20.542
Do you want to shoot yourself?

30:22.625 --> 30:23.958
We need to drive them out.

30:26.167 --> 30:28.292
What did he say?

30:32.333 --> 30:35.250
I want to drive them out of our land.

30:47.083 --> 30:50.583
- Falcons flutter in the sky.
- Falcons flutter in the sky.

30:50.667 --> 30:54.167
- Our squad flies into battle.
- Our squad flies into battle.

30:54.250 --> 30:57.500
- We will defeat the enemies.
- We will defeat the enemies.

30:57.583 --> 31:00.958
- Although they crawl from all sides.
- Although they crawl from all sides.

31:01.042 --> 31:03.333
Come on, guys, come on.

31:03.417 --> 31:06.375
Faster. Tempo, tempo I said! Come on!

31:13.375 --> 31:14.292
Bad!

31:15.375 --> 31:16.500
As you were!

31:17.875 --> 31:18.875
Show him.

31:33.083 --> 31:34.125
As you were!

31:35.583 --> 31:37.250
That's it, comrade!

31:38.250 --> 31:40.667
Come on, come on, men, faster!

31:41.583 --> 31:44.250
Thirty-three,

31:44.333 --> 31:46.750
thirty-four...

31:46.833 --> 31:49.833
- Thirty-five!
- Keep the body straight.

31:49.917 --> 31:51.375
Thirty-six!

31:51.458 --> 31:53.417
Thirty-seven!

31:55.500 --> 31:59.583
And now have a rest!

32:03.917 --> 32:07.083
Well, do you enjoy being here
as a pacifist?

32:08.375 --> 32:10.625
Yes, sir, Mr. Commander!

32:11.167 --> 32:12.583
I'm glad to hear that.

32:14.208 --> 32:17.083
Permission to speak, sir, Mr. Commander!

32:17.583 --> 32:18.750
Permitted.

32:20.542 --> 32:23.292
I'm not a pacifist, Mr. Commander.

32:24.708 --> 32:26.917
My code name is Raven!

32:27.542 --> 32:29.000
Dead Raven!

32:31.333 --> 32:33.500
I said one and a half!

32:41.250 --> 32:43.833
This code name still needs
to be earned, comrade.

32:44.708 --> 32:46.000
Do you understand?

32:46.083 --> 32:48.250
Yes, sir, Mr. Commander!

32:51.042 --> 32:51.875
Chief.

32:57.458 --> 32:58.292
Crazy?

33:00.750 --> 33:02.000
Hey, bud, you want tea?

33:05.833 --> 33:06.667
And you?

33:31.750 --> 33:32.792
Don't sleep!

33:33.542 --> 33:35.625
Quickly, quickly...

33:35.708 --> 33:38.333
Girls, don't get caught in your bras!

33:59.542 --> 34:02.542
The war will come to an end while you are
still swarming like a pacifist!

34:02.625 --> 34:05.750
Start again! Disassemble!

34:15.333 --> 34:18.250
Quickly! Let's not linger!

34:18.333 --> 34:20.542
Twenty-eight,

34:20.625 --> 34:23.417
twenty-nine...

34:23.500 --> 34:25.875
- Lower!
- Forty...

35:07.583 --> 35:08.875
Attention!

35:09.917 --> 35:12.500
There are not enough snipers at the front.

35:13.583 --> 35:17.542
Volunteers organize free courses.
Are you interested?

35:21.833 --> 35:24.250
Bad, Klym, Dunay, good.

35:29.167 --> 35:31.250
What? A pacifist? You too? Sit down.

35:32.458 --> 35:34.417
I, private Raven, ask to join!

35:35.458 --> 35:38.917
Listen, you don't know
how to remove a magazine from the AK!

35:39.000 --> 35:40.125
Which of you is a sniper?

35:44.167 --> 35:45.500
Let me show you!

35:47.833 --> 35:51.083
Interesting. And what can you show us?

35:55.875 --> 35:58.458
Disassembly-assembly of AK in 20 seconds.

36:01.375 --> 36:03.208
In 20 seconds?

36:07.625 --> 36:08.708
This should be fun.

36:09.875 --> 36:10.833
Well,

36:11.917 --> 36:13.125
you asked yourself.

36:16.625 --> 36:17.458
Come on.

36:25.125 --> 36:28.500
Well, warrior... ready?

36:41.333 --> 36:42.250
Well.

36:44.333 --> 36:45.625
Come on!

37:05.917 --> 37:07.042
Well.

37:07.542 --> 37:09.750
Congratulations to Private Raven...

37:09.833 --> 37:11.542
Eighteen seconds!

37:11.625 --> 37:12.875
Well done! Bravo!

37:14.667 --> 37:15.542
Well done!

37:17.708 --> 37:19.000
That's what I understand.

37:20.333 --> 37:21.708
Find him one SKS.

37:42.917 --> 37:44.625
Right turn! March!

37:45.750 --> 37:47.542
Right turn! March!

37:49.208 --> 37:51.000
Nobody likes snipers

37:52.250 --> 37:54.167
because they are insidious and elegant.

37:55.125 --> 37:59.375
There are no forbidden methods
of waging war for them.

38:03.333 --> 38:06.750
Professional snipers work in disguise
without modern special equipment.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.750
Their position
is almost impossible to detect.

38:14.583 --> 38:15.583
Especially...

38:17.208 --> 38:21.250
if no shots are heard
or they are hidden under another noise.

38:22.292 --> 38:23.167
Excuse me,

38:24.875 --> 38:25.958
what does that mean?

38:27.500 --> 38:31.000
In order not to get caught,
the sniper fires his shot

38:31.083 --> 38:33.833
during a machine gun fire
or the sound of explosions.

38:42.292 --> 38:43.292
Next!

38:44.583 --> 38:45.458
Budkevych.

38:54.625 --> 38:56.458
- Next!
- Dunaevsky.

39:06.458 --> 39:07.708
Next!

39:07.792 --> 39:08.667
Voronenko.

39:16.792 --> 39:17.875
Next!

39:22.083 --> 39:24.208
- What is this?
- A horse in a coat!

39:24.292 --> 39:26.833
This is SKS.
"Simonov's self-loading carbine"!

39:30.417 --> 39:31.417
Next!

39:32.333 --> 39:33.208
This is a mistake.

39:34.625 --> 39:37.000
I have to have an SVD like everybody else.

39:38.292 --> 39:42.583
Dear, no need for songs here!
Is it a circus for you here?

39:42.667 --> 39:44.417
Do I look like a clown?

39:44.500 --> 39:46.208
This is, the fucking, army!

39:46.833 --> 39:49.417
Your task is to pick up the fucking gun
and get the fuck out of here!

39:51.125 --> 39:52.000
Can I go?

39:54.375 --> 39:57.375
What is this... Blaster, fuck!

39:57.458 --> 40:00.208
And we are all space pirates here,
for fuck's sake!

40:00.292 --> 40:01.208
Don't giggle!

40:02.667 --> 40:07.417
Soldiers, I do not repeat anything twice.

40:07.500 --> 40:09.833
Nobody is going to jerk off with you here!

40:12.375 --> 40:13.833
Next!

40:17.292 --> 40:18.167
Look, Raven.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.167
Will you give me your Blaster for a shot?

40:55.792 --> 41:01.208
The basic rule of a sniper is to remain
invisible under any circumstances.

41:02.042 --> 41:05.083
If you move, assume you've been killed.

41:07.667 --> 41:08.708
Moved.

41:09.375 --> 41:10.458
Minus one point.

41:17.542 --> 41:18.500
Minus.

41:28.292 --> 41:29.125
Minus.

41:38.250 --> 41:39.167
Minus.

41:40.958 --> 41:46.000
Have a look
at your 1963 Dragunov sniper rifle.

41:46.708 --> 41:53.333
With its obsolete
7.62 by 54 mm ammunition,

41:54.625 --> 41:58.208
it has a working distance

41:59.292 --> 42:02.083
of approximately 600 meters.

42:03.250 --> 42:05.667
In contrast,

42:06.917 --> 42:12.125
modern 8.6 by 70 Lapua Magnum

42:12.958 --> 42:16.708
or 12.7 by 99 BMG...

42:18.667 --> 42:21.375
rifles hit targets...

42:22.458 --> 42:24.500
even at 2,000 meters.

42:27.167 --> 42:29.875
And how far does your rifle shoot?

42:31.167 --> 42:36.000
Remington 308 caliber
has a working distance of...

42:38.625 --> 42:41.375
about 800 meters.

42:44.292 --> 42:46.375
And if the enemy has a better shot?

42:46.958 --> 42:48.375
Then you are unlucky.

42:51.750 --> 42:54.250
This is called a ballistic vulnerability.

42:57.667 --> 42:59.958
But it's not a rifle
that makes a sniper dangerous...

43:00.958 --> 43:03.375
But his intelligence and endurance.

43:05.625 --> 43:06.958
The next task...

43:08.583 --> 43:09.583
be ready.

43:11.167 --> 43:14.375
The sniper must always be stable
and focused.

43:15.333 --> 43:16.167
Charge!

43:19.208 --> 43:20.042
Take aim.

43:24.250 --> 43:25.083
Ready.

43:27.167 --> 43:29.958
One, two, three... Fire!

43:35.083 --> 43:36.042
Plus.

43:41.250 --> 43:42.083
Ready.

43:43.750 --> 43:45.917
One, two, three... Fire!

43:50.208 --> 43:51.042
Plus.

43:56.000 --> 43:56.875
Ready.

43:58.417 --> 44:00.708
One, two, three... Fire!

44:04.500 --> 44:05.333
Minus.

44:06.208 --> 44:08.125
It's not possible with such a firearm!

44:11.042 --> 44:12.208
Some succeeded.

44:15.500 --> 44:17.167
One of the important skills a sniper

44:17.250 --> 44:19.792
has to have is the ability to be able
to calculate quickly in your head.

44:19.875 --> 44:21.458
Your eyes will be occupied
with observing things.

44:21.958 --> 44:23.500
Forget about the calculator.

44:24.250 --> 44:25.833
To determine the distance,

44:25.917 --> 44:28.875
you must multiply
the size of the object by 1000

44:28.958 --> 44:31.958
and divide by the number
of points in sight.

44:32.042 --> 44:35.625
So the task is to determine
the distance to the KAMAZ.

44:36.250 --> 44:39.042
The height of the KAMAZ is 3.45...

44:40.708 --> 44:43.667
and has seven points,

44:44.458 --> 44:45.792
The height
of the armored personnel carrier...

44:47.708 --> 44:49.167
is 2.35...

44:50.250 --> 44:53.208
and has 2.5 points.

44:54.375 --> 44:55.542
Tank width...

44:57.625 --> 44:58.958
3.46...

44:59.625 --> 45:00.667
Allow me...

45:01.292 --> 45:02.625
Is something unclear, Raven?

45:04.000 --> 45:06.375
- I want to give the answer.
- Try it.

45:06.458 --> 45:08.917
Distance to KAMAZ is 493 meters.

45:09.667 --> 45:10.917
That's right.

45:12.042 --> 45:14.792
940 meters and 804 and a half.

45:20.292 --> 45:22.333
To the armored personnel carrier
and to the tank accordingly.

45:29.917 --> 45:31.000
Not bad, Raven.

46:07.875 --> 46:12.250
Before the shot,
everyone should call his code out loud.

46:12.333 --> 46:14.458
"Code green" for I can shoot.

46:14.542 --> 46:17.208
"Code red" for I can't shoot.

46:18.250 --> 46:19.250
Get ready!

46:20.708 --> 46:21.917
Attention!

46:22.875 --> 46:23.792
Three,

46:24.375 --> 46:26.042
two, one...

46:29.417 --> 46:30.333
Code green.

46:31.333 --> 46:32.417
Code green.

46:37.958 --> 46:38.958
Bob, minus.

46:39.458 --> 46:40.417
Bad, plus.

46:40.958 --> 46:42.333
Yartur, plus.

46:42.417 --> 46:43.375
Klym, plus.

46:43.875 --> 46:44.875
Mor, minus.

46:45.417 --> 46:46.292
Dunay, plus.

46:47.292 --> 46:48.292
Raven, minus...

46:48.875 --> 46:51.792
Exam completed.
Discharge everyone's weapons.

47:05.208 --> 47:07.500
Raven, haven't you heard the command?

47:08.833 --> 47:10.333
The exam is not over yet.

47:12.042 --> 47:12.875
Why is that?

47:14.750 --> 47:15.750
I didn't shoot.

47:18.125 --> 47:19.917
Are you going to wait for dawn?

47:21.333 --> 47:22.208
The code is green!

47:25.958 --> 47:27.417
Wow, holy Blaster!

47:34.792 --> 47:36.042
Plus three, Raven.

47:40.500 --> 47:41.583
Thank you for waiting.

47:45.333 --> 47:46.208
Klym!

47:46.292 --> 47:47.167
Yes sir!

47:47.833 --> 47:48.875
Second-class.

47:49.833 --> 47:50.667
Congratulations.

47:51.333 --> 47:53.083
I serve the Ukrainian people!

47:56.750 --> 47:57.625
Dunay!

47:57.708 --> 47:58.667
Yes sir!

47:58.750 --> 48:01.125
Third-class. Congratulations.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.458
I serve the Ukrainian people!

48:06.500 --> 48:07.500
Raven!

48:07.583 --> 48:08.583
Yes sir!

48:08.667 --> 48:09.750
First-class.

48:11.042 --> 48:11.875
Congratulations.

48:14.875 --> 48:16.667
I serve the Ukrainian people!

48:18.667 --> 48:20.125
- Bad!
- Yes sir!

48:20.208 --> 48:22.500
Second-class. Congratulations...

48:24.458 --> 48:30.167
Tell me, why did this happen?

48:31.542 --> 48:37.792
Why is it that my world
Is not enough for your world?

48:39.667 --> 48:45.833
The two of us touched for a moment

48:47.833 --> 48:54.833
And time passes us by craftily

48:55.958 --> 49:01.792
Nobody knows where to go now

49:03.667 --> 49:10.667
Nobody is waiting at home

49:12.042 --> 49:18.458
Dive in, love your will

49:19.500 --> 49:26.500
But don't get lost in the pain

49:27.708 --> 49:34.708
And awaken, awaken strength in yourself

49:35.500 --> 49:42.500
Build strength in yourself

49:43.458 --> 49:50.167
My dear, my dear...

49:51.458 --> 49:58.458
I wish we had wings...

50:11.042 --> 50:13.208
We need to go to the zero line
to our positions.

50:13.292 --> 50:15.083
Here they captured our checkpoint
on the bridge.

50:16.042 --> 50:17.750
I don't have enough people...

50:19.833 --> 50:22.000
We need to clean up
before they get strengthened.

50:24.125 --> 50:25.167
What do they have?

50:26.083 --> 50:29.042
No armor, nothing heavy. We'll handle it.

50:30.458 --> 50:31.667
And the machine gunners?

50:33.708 --> 50:35.208
Pokemon and RPK.

50:37.500 --> 50:40.583
Okay, take the snipers and assault team.

50:41.458 --> 50:42.292
Plus.

50:42.875 --> 50:43.708
Plus.

50:53.667 --> 50:56.708
- Hello, guys.
- We wish you good health!

50:59.417 --> 51:00.542
- Voron...
- Aye, sir.

51:01.208 --> 51:02.042
Pack up your staff.

51:03.958 --> 51:05.708
Yes, sir, Lieutenant Colonel.

51:44.167 --> 51:45.500
Third in position.

51:47.917 --> 51:48.958
First in position.

51:51.708 --> 51:53.333
The second is ready.

52:10.000 --> 52:10.917
What is the distance?

52:14.458 --> 52:15.542
400 meters.

52:21.250 --> 52:22.208
Two up.

52:34.583 --> 52:36.250
Your machine gunner is on the left,

52:38.417 --> 52:39.958
I'm working on the right.

52:42.375 --> 52:43.208
Plus.

52:49.167 --> 52:50.000
Ready.

52:55.750 --> 52:56.625
Prepared.

52:57.917 --> 52:58.875
Countdown.

53:00.750 --> 53:01.625
Plus.

53:02.875 --> 53:03.708
Two,

53:04.792 --> 53:05.625
one...

53:06.292 --> 53:08.083
- Car on 9!
- Stop!

53:14.208 --> 53:16.250
Cap, machine. Two civilians.

53:29.125 --> 53:30.292
Get out of the car!

53:33.292 --> 53:34.125
Documents.

53:50.875 --> 53:54.292
- Give me my passport!
- Watch your hands, bitch!

54:08.292 --> 54:09.625
Wait.

54:10.292 --> 54:11.125
Plus.

54:23.125 --> 54:24.000
Attention!

54:28.458 --> 54:29.375
Countdown.

54:31.625 --> 54:32.458
Three...

54:33.583 --> 54:34.458
two...

54:35.792 --> 54:36.625
one!

54:49.708 --> 54:50.542
Contact.

54:50.625 --> 54:51.833
Get back, bitch!

54:51.917 --> 54:54.083
The target
is a militant behind the hostage.

54:57.917 --> 54:59.583
I operate near the hostage.

55:14.125 --> 55:15.250
Lie down, stupid!

55:17.250 --> 55:19.292
Hit. Clean!

55:31.708 --> 55:34.000
Congratulations
on your first successful task.

55:42.542 --> 55:43.375
Clean!

56:27.833 --> 56:28.792
Come on.

56:50.708 --> 56:51.583
Hello guys.

56:55.875 --> 56:57.583
- Congratulations, boys!
- Hello.

56:57.667 --> 56:59.500
- Are Klym and Dunay here?
- I am not sure.

57:10.583 --> 57:11.417
Bad!

57:12.583 --> 57:13.625
Hello.

57:13.708 --> 57:14.708
Where are Klym and Dunay?

57:15.708 --> 57:16.750
On the mission.

1:02:06.500 --> 1:02:07.333
Dunay...

1:02:11.417 --> 1:02:12.250
Where is Klym?

1:02:58.417 --> 1:02:59.375
What did you find out?

1:03:01.542 --> 1:03:05.875
The medic said that the bullet
in Klym's body opened like a flower,

1:03:07.667 --> 1:03:09.625
some fragments passed through,

1:03:11.208 --> 1:03:12.875
and others got stuck in the armor plate.

1:03:16.417 --> 1:03:17.833
The guy had no chance.

1:03:20.083 --> 1:03:22.458
The vehicle breaks through,

1:03:23.375 --> 1:03:24.875
what can we say about the body...

1:03:26.208 --> 1:03:28.083
they want to demoralize us.

1:03:34.708 --> 1:03:35.875
So that's it.

1:03:37.583 --> 1:03:40.458
We need to quickly occupy
our trench at the zero line,

1:03:40.542 --> 1:03:42.875
where ours were evacuated.

1:03:44.208 --> 1:03:48.000
Take a detour along this forest strip,
the DRG enemy was noticed here.

1:03:48.083 --> 1:03:49.958
I'll give you an assault group to cover.

1:03:50.500 --> 1:03:51.792
As you occupy the trench,

1:03:51.875 --> 1:03:54.917
keep an eye
on their positions here, nearby.

1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:56.583
Just be careful,

1:03:57.792 --> 1:03:59.500
there may be a sniper somewhere.

1:04:00.750 --> 1:04:01.750
If it's clean,

1:04:02.417 --> 1:04:03.833
I'll send a company to strengthen it.

1:04:05.750 --> 1:04:06.583
Follow.

1:04:07.875 --> 1:04:08.708
Plus.

1:04:13.833 --> 1:04:16.875
Cossacks, five minutes left.

1:06:14.875 --> 1:06:15.708
Report...

1:06:17.375 --> 1:06:18.292
First clear.

1:06:19.250 --> 1:06:20.083
Plus.

1:06:26.375 --> 1:06:27.875
Distance 120.

1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:30.875
Plus.

1:06:50.083 --> 1:06:53.500
Cap, third post. I see a group of five.

1:06:53.583 --> 1:06:59.083
Russian uniform, confidently going
on the green to meet you, do you roger?

1:06:59.667 --> 1:07:00.500
Plus.

1:07:02.250 --> 1:07:03.917
The goal will be in 25.

1:07:07.208 --> 1:07:08.042
Twenty...

1:07:12.208 --> 1:07:13.208
Fifteen...

1:07:17.125 --> 1:07:18.000
Ten,

1:07:18.625 --> 1:07:19.458
nine...

1:07:20.208 --> 1:07:21.042
Ivan?

1:07:22.042 --> 1:07:23.042
Six,

1:07:24.042 --> 1:07:24.875
five,

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:27.042
four,

1:07:28.167 --> 1:07:29.000
three,

1:07:30.042 --> 1:07:30.875
two,

1:07:31.917 --> 1:07:33.083
one.

1:07:33.167 --> 1:07:34.125
Fire!

1:07:48.375 --> 1:07:49.375
Good job.

1:07:53.917 --> 1:07:57.250
- We're done, finish it.
- Plus-plus.

1:08:12.375 --> 1:08:13.417
Who is Ivan?

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:17.917
My former student from Horlivka.

1:08:27.042 --> 1:08:28.375
He made his choice.

1:08:39.917 --> 1:08:40.833
As did I...

1:09:57.042 --> 1:09:58.667
Huh, yeah. Piece of shit.

1:10:02.417 --> 1:10:03.500
So what's up?

1:10:06.583 --> 1:10:08.208
Stretches checked.

1:10:09.042 --> 1:10:11.333
It will not be possible
to climb through quietly.

1:10:24.833 --> 1:10:25.875
Who is in the photo?

1:10:27.917 --> 1:10:28.750
Family.

1:10:30.500 --> 1:10:31.458
Can I have a look?

1:10:36.500 --> 1:10:37.917
My wife Svitlana

1:10:39.042 --> 1:10:41.458
and daughters, Vika and Myroslava.

1:10:43.875 --> 1:10:45.250
Do the kids know where you are now?

1:10:48.125 --> 1:10:48.958
No.

1:10:49.458 --> 1:10:50.958
They think that I'm on a business trip.

1:10:52.042 --> 1:10:55.542
My wife and I agreed that
if they know less, they will sleep better.

1:10:57.125 --> 1:11:00.167
That's why she's worried
about everyone there.

1:11:03.083 --> 1:11:04.250
Got it.

1:11:22.250 --> 1:11:23.208
Is this your amulet?

1:11:36.125 --> 1:11:36.958
This is my...

1:11:38.708 --> 1:11:39.542
family.

1:11:59.208 --> 1:12:01.333
Their positions are here.

1:12:02.583 --> 1:12:04.417
Keep an eye on them.

1:12:04.500 --> 1:12:05.333
Yes, I understand. Crystal.

1:12:16.583 --> 1:12:18.542
Yes, of course, Nikolai Ivanych,

1:12:19.083 --> 1:12:21.083
we will do everything, don't worry.

1:12:22.083 --> 1:12:23.458
On the other side, we need more.

1:12:28.125 --> 1:12:29.833
Five minutes. Come on, come on.

1:12:29.917 --> 1:12:31.208
Understood, I'm working.

1:12:32.375 --> 1:12:34.042
Are the weapons checked?

1:12:34.125 --> 1:12:35.208
Batteries, walkie-talkies,

1:12:35.292 --> 1:12:36.458
- first aid kits.
- We have it!

1:12:36.542 --> 1:12:37.667
Everything is there!

1:12:37.750 --> 1:12:38.792
Take off the flag, fuck...

1:12:38.875 --> 1:12:43.708
- Exactly! Shoot, bro!
- Come on.

1:12:44.208 --> 1:12:46.667
Just cut the normal branches,
why are you dragging this shit.

1:12:51.250 --> 1:12:53.083
Here they have two.

1:12:54.458 --> 1:12:56.000
Here is a machine gun and a sniper pair.

1:12:56.792 --> 1:12:59.250
- Will you cover-up?
- Yeah.

1:12:59.333 --> 1:13:00.500
Do you need an assistant?

1:13:01.917 --> 1:13:02.875
I'll handle it.

1:13:03.958 --> 1:13:06.042
- Everything is ready.
- Let's get everyone inside.

1:13:06.125 --> 1:13:09.958
- Get inside!
- Start engine!

1:13:14.958 --> 1:13:15.958
- Start engine!
- Let's go!

1:14:51.417 --> 1:14:53.167
At 11 o'clock there is a car.

1:14:55.792 --> 1:14:56.750
I see.

1:15:01.375 --> 1:15:03.542
Two militants near the car.

1:15:04.792 --> 1:15:06.417
Continue observation.

1:15:42.625 --> 1:15:44.083
A fighter with a machine gun.

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.333
The code is green. I can work!

1:15:51.625 --> 1:15:52.917
I do not allow you to.

1:15:53.458 --> 1:15:55.000
Keep observing.

1:15:57.542 --> 1:15:58.958
A fighter with a machine gun.

1:15:59.708 --> 1:16:02.458
The code is green. I can work!

1:16:02.542 --> 1:16:04.458
Put on the fuse!

1:16:08.042 --> 1:16:10.792
A fighter with a machine gun!
The code is green! I'm shooting!

1:16:10.875 --> 1:16:12.792
Put on the safety. That is an order!

1:16:16.083 --> 1:16:17.375
Motherfucker!

1:16:40.542 --> 1:16:41.583
I have 200!

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:21.583
Sniper at 10 o'clock!

1:17:29.750 --> 1:17:33.000
Sniper! On the tenth! Distance 2,000.

1:17:39.625 --> 1:17:40.833
The first minus.

1:17:43.083 --> 1:17:44.875
Second in the sector K4.

1:17:45.667 --> 1:17:46.875
Yes. We are working.

1:19:34.458 --> 1:19:36.000
I asked at the top...

1:19:41.667 --> 1:19:43.792
Secret services will look
for the killer of the Cap.

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:51.250
When there is information,

1:19:52.083 --> 1:19:53.667
I'll call you

1:19:54.833 --> 1:19:57.750
and you will deal with it.

1:20:03.208 --> 1:20:04.083
Do you understand?

1:20:18.625 --> 1:20:19.458
Dismissed.

1:20:41.542 --> 1:20:42.375
Captain...

1:21:02.833 --> 1:21:03.750
It's time for us.

1:22:16.875 --> 1:22:17.708
Yakut.

1:22:19.250 --> 1:22:20.083
What do you have?

1:22:21.500 --> 1:22:22.750
How long will I be lying here?

1:22:23.250 --> 1:22:25.333
I won't be able
to wash off this shit for a week.

1:22:28.792 --> 1:22:33.750
Be patient, Makar.
You will lie in my shit all my life.

1:22:35.625 --> 1:22:36.750
Fuck off.

1:22:58.917 --> 1:23:00.125
I waved everything.

1:23:39.833 --> 1:23:43.375
I will crawl to you.

1:24:02.167 --> 1:24:03.292
Makar, respond.

1:24:11.458 --> 1:24:15.292
Fuck. Where are you, have you fallen?

1:24:18.792 --> 1:24:20.083
You, bitch.

1:25:02.750 --> 1:25:07.375
...The third-largest nuclear arsenal

1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.708
in the world.

1:25:11.458 --> 1:25:14.458
And in 1994 a memorandum was signed

1:25:14.542 --> 1:25:17.625
between Ukraine, Russia,
Great Britain, and the USA...

1:25:17.708 --> 1:25:18.667
That's right.

1:25:18.750 --> 1:25:24.042
The memorandum on non-proliferation
guaranteed Ukraine's independence,

1:25:24.125 --> 1:25:26.875
sovereignty, and borders.

1:25:26.958 --> 1:25:31.333
We all know how Russia respects
the borders of other states...

1:25:31.417 --> 1:25:34.958
So the solution to this problem...

1:26:09.167 --> 1:26:13.708
BRIGADE COMMANDER

1:26:19.583 --> 1:26:20.583
Speaking.

1:26:20.667 --> 1:26:22.292
It lit up near Horlivka.

1:26:23.375 --> 1:26:25.083
He fired two of our scouts.

1:26:28.250 --> 1:26:29.333
Was it in a wide range?

1:26:29.833 --> 1:26:30.667
Yes.

1:26:30.750 --> 1:26:33.667
The first, two days ago.
The second, today.

1:26:33.750 --> 1:26:35.292
From one position?

1:26:35.375 --> 1:26:39.333
Not by the phone.
At the meeting. Get ready.

1:28:05.292 --> 1:28:06.167
ID?

1:28:10.667 --> 1:28:11.667
Drive.

1:28:11.750 --> 1:28:12.667
Open it.

1:28:40.833 --> 1:28:43.958
Code name Elbrus, second-class.

1:28:44.583 --> 1:28:45.417
Congratulations.

1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:51.792
- Beast, third-class, congratulations.
- Yeah.

1:28:54.042 --> 1:28:55.708
- Ray, third-class...
- Yes.

1:28:56.500 --> 1:28:57.417
Congratulations.

1:28:57.917 --> 1:29:02.458
- Congratulations.
- I serve the Ukrainian people!

1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:05.250
- How are you?
- Alive.

1:29:08.917 --> 1:29:10.000
Got you this.

1:29:11.917 --> 1:29:12.958
Thank you.

1:29:25.375 --> 1:29:26.500
- Hello!
- Hi!

1:29:30.208 --> 1:29:33.708
Cadets, at ease.
Grab your stuff and get in the car.

1:29:35.292 --> 1:29:36.125
Raven...

1:29:36.792 --> 1:29:37.625
Aye.

1:29:38.250 --> 1:29:40.042
- Ready?
- Yes sir.

1:29:42.500 --> 1:29:43.333
Follow me.

1:29:49.417 --> 1:29:50.417
Attention to all.

1:29:51.417 --> 1:29:53.292
Recently, intelligence provided us
with information...

1:29:54.708 --> 1:29:55.750
Show the slide.

1:29:58.542 --> 1:30:00.875
Russian sniper. Call sign "Sery".

1:30:00.958 --> 1:30:05.167
Works with 12.7 over long distances,
mostly 1.5 km.

1:30:06.333 --> 1:30:08.125
The bullets are wide-ranging.

1:30:09.167 --> 1:30:13.167
He has already killed five of our snipers
and three machine gunners.

1:30:14.833 --> 1:30:15.667
Show the site.

1:30:17.833 --> 1:30:20.542
He publishes his videos to demoralize us.

1:30:20.625 --> 1:30:24.292
In one of these videos, is our Cap.

1:30:24.375 --> 1:30:25.208
Shit!

1:30:26.125 --> 1:30:27.750
Yesterday our sniper

1:30:27.833 --> 1:30:29.917
was killed by the same bullet
between armor plates

1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:31.833
near a chemical plant next to the river.

1:30:32.708 --> 1:30:35.167
Today was the same,
they hit in the same sector.

1:30:35.750 --> 1:30:36.875
They didn't change position?

1:30:37.833 --> 1:30:39.500
Cover it with mines.

1:30:40.083 --> 1:30:41.042
It won't work.

1:30:42.333 --> 1:30:44.417
Raven, you are a local,
explain to the guys.

1:30:45.833 --> 1:30:48.500
There is a chlorine storage under pressure
in the chemical plant.

1:30:49.917 --> 1:30:53.000
Well, fuck them.
PTUR him to the damn mother.

1:30:53.625 --> 1:30:56.583
- Explosion of cylinders is guaranteed.
- So what?

1:30:57.667 --> 1:30:59.375
Environmental disaster.

1:30:59.458 --> 1:31:00.292
Fuck.

1:31:02.208 --> 1:31:03.208
Is that clear to everyone?

1:31:05.375 --> 1:31:07.875
The plan is as follows. Map.

1:31:09.333 --> 1:31:11.292
There are a total of eight militants
on the territory.

1:31:11.917 --> 1:31:13.375
The sniper himself is probably
in a building

1:31:13.458 --> 1:31:15.000
where there are warehouses with chlorine.

1:31:15.083 --> 1:31:17.750
Plus two of his observers
are probably on the floors.

1:31:18.542 --> 1:31:19.375
So,

1:31:20.708 --> 1:31:24.417
the first pair of snipers
takes the first fighter.

1:31:25.208 --> 1:31:28.833
The second and third are these targets.

1:31:29.542 --> 1:31:31.875
The fourth and fifth are these two.

1:31:32.542 --> 1:31:33.625
And the final targets,

1:31:34.833 --> 1:31:35.750
two observers...

1:31:37.292 --> 1:31:38.250
and Sery.

1:31:38.750 --> 1:31:43.083
What's the point? Anyway, we cannot
shoot this chlorine under pressure.

1:31:43.833 --> 1:31:46.542
Our task is to clear the access only.

1:31:48.750 --> 1:31:49.667
And then what?

1:31:53.958 --> 1:31:55.667
Then Raven climbs up to him.

1:32:04.292 --> 1:32:05.125
Questions?

1:32:08.125 --> 1:32:09.042
Get ready.

1:32:55.667 --> 1:32:57.167
Raven, status.

1:33:01.625 --> 1:33:03.167
Three hours.

1:33:05.125 --> 1:33:05.958
Plus.

1:33:52.333 --> 1:33:53.250
First.

1:33:56.250 --> 1:33:57.292
In position.

1:33:59.833 --> 1:34:00.667
Second.

1:34:02.417 --> 1:34:03.375
In position.

1:35:04.167 --> 1:35:05.333
Raven, status...

1:35:12.958 --> 1:35:14.042
In position...

1:35:37.958 --> 1:35:39.208
Ah, pacifist...

1:35:40.208 --> 1:35:42.417
I should have shot you then...

1:35:55.125 --> 1:35:56.792
- Clear.
- Plus.

1:36:09.125 --> 1:36:11.333
Attention, readiness. Report...

1:36:11.417 --> 1:36:12.875
First ready.

1:36:18.500 --> 1:36:19.667
Second ready.

1:36:20.833 --> 1:36:22.375
Third ready.

1:36:28.125 --> 1:36:29.208
Fifth ready...

1:36:34.625 --> 1:36:36.250
I see the target, the code is green.

1:36:38.583 --> 1:36:39.542
Countdown...

1:36:40.250 --> 1:36:41.083
Five,

1:36:41.167 --> 1:36:42.042
four,

1:36:42.125 --> 1:36:43.250
three,

1:36:43.333 --> 1:36:44.292
two,

1:36:44.375 --> 1:36:45.417
one.

1:37:00.750 --> 1:37:01.708
Whose fire?

1:37:02.625 --> 1:37:06.000
Fuck if I know.
The moron is watering somewhere.

1:37:20.375 --> 1:37:21.208
Report!

1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:22.833
Clear.

1:37:23.833 --> 1:37:25.750
- Raven, work.
- Plus.

1:37:40.250 --> 1:37:41.083
First.

1:37:42.500 --> 1:37:43.750
First.

1:37:46.333 --> 1:37:47.208
Second.

1:37:48.125 --> 1:37:49.125
In place.

1:37:49.958 --> 1:37:51.083
Report.

1:37:51.875 --> 1:37:53.000
Group, report...

1:37:54.042 --> 1:37:55.125
Group, report.

1:37:56.875 --> 1:37:58.083
Group, report.

1:38:08.750 --> 1:38:12.000
- There is no connection with the group.
- Second, report to me.

1:39:00.833 --> 1:39:01.667
Sery!

1:39:19.917 --> 1:39:21.792
- Hold your position!
- Yes.

1:39:48.375 --> 1:39:49.333
Fuck.

1:39:50.167 --> 1:39:52.167
- Second...
- In place.

1:39:56.125 --> 1:39:58.042
- Brown.
- Affirmative.

1:39:58.917 --> 1:40:02.708
- I have one 200.
- What happened?

1:40:02.792 --> 1:40:04.167
Sniper.

1:40:09.583 --> 1:40:12.167
Clear. What about the security group?

1:40:12.250 --> 1:40:13.542
No connection.

1:40:13.625 --> 1:40:17.000
Got it. Ten minutes. Hold your position.

1:40:19.167 --> 1:40:20.167
Yes.

1:40:24.833 --> 1:40:25.750
Second.

1:40:26.750 --> 1:40:27.708
In place.

1:40:27.792 --> 1:40:30.333
Return to your position
and guard the entrance.

1:40:30.417 --> 1:40:31.292
Yes.

1:42:14.458 --> 1:42:15.583
Fuck...

1:43:01.875 --> 1:43:03.167
Sery. Do you copy?

1:43:06.500 --> 1:43:08.667
Sery, arrived with a group. Do you copy?

1:43:08.750 --> 1:43:11.458
You shitbags will answer us for Crimea.

1:43:50.125 --> 1:43:51.833
- Clean.
- Clean.

1:43:53.042 --> 1:43:54.792
Raven, the perimeter is clean.

1:43:55.958 --> 1:43:56.875
Plus.

1:45:50.708 --> 1:45:52.208
Let him stay with me...

1:46:58.625 --> 1:47:00.542
Guide your hand, Lord,

1:47:01.042 --> 1:47:03.625
to destroy all enemies...

1:47:05.083 --> 1:47:06.375
on this land.
