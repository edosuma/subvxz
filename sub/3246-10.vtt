00:38.455 --> 00:43.552
Doctor! Doctor, look out!
Doctor, he's going! Quick!

00:46.421 --> 00:48.423
Where's he gone?
Do you see him?

00:48.507 --> 00:51.260
- There he is. Stop! No!
- Where is he?

00:51.343 --> 00:53.345
- Watch out!
- Where?

01:26.378 --> 01:28.221
That's what it did, it went...

01:30.007 --> 01:33.386
And if you think
that was the most exciting day of my life,

01:33.468 --> 01:35.436
wait till you hear the rest.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.889
Oh, boy.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.062
So there I was, with that thing going...

02:22.434 --> 02:27.156
Here, boy. Eat the food. Come on.
Look at the lovely food, isn't that nice?

02:27.230 --> 02:29.653
Isn't it? Yes, it is! Get
out of here, quickly.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.952
That's a boy!
Who'd like a porky choppy, then?

02:32.069 --> 02:33.787
I said run!

02:37.991 --> 02:40.870
- Wrong one! You made it worse!
- You said blue.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.875
I said not blue!

02:45.749 --> 02:47.376
Hold on.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.410
Hold on.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.246
Don't I know you?

03:27.290 --> 03:30.294
<i>You can't imagine it, the Doctor's machine.</i>

03:31.169 --> 03:35.265
The most beautiful sound in the world.

03:35.632 --> 03:40.638
That wasn't the first time I met the Doctor
and it certainly wasn't the last.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.018
Oh, no.

03:42.139 --> 03:46.110
I just put that bit at the beginning
because it's a brilliant opening.

03:46.184 --> 03:49.654
But this is the story of me

03:49.730 --> 03:53.405
and my encounters with alien life forms.

03:53.483 --> 03:58.990
But be warned!
Because it is gonna get scary.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.083
I need a remote control zoom.

04:02.159 --> 04:05.663
I'm having to do that with a lean,
the scary. Anyway.

04:05.787 --> 04:10.839
But don't worry 'cause it's not just me
sitting here talking. Oh, no.

04:10.917 --> 04:14.467
- That's Ursula on camera.
- Hello.

04:14.546 --> 04:17.925
My good friend Ursula Blake
on my brand-new camera.

04:18.007 --> 04:22.388
That was my family home, down there.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.982
I did try
but there's two women live there now.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.936
They're a bit severe. So, never mind.

04:29.019 --> 04:34.116
But that is where it all started
'cause that's when I first met the Doctor.

04:36.818 --> 04:41.119
What was it?
I must've been three or four years old.

04:41.198 --> 04:44.623
<i>Middle of the night I went downstairs,</i>

04:44.701 --> 04:47.420
and there was this man.

04:52.876 --> 04:56.881
So what happened? Elton?
Tell me, why was he there?

04:57.964 --> 05:01.719
I don't know. I still don't know.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.104
All those years ago.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.571
Okay, first things first.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.901
My name is Elton, not
to be confused with...

05:18.985 --> 05:22.990
I left school, I got a job,
transport manager at Rita Logistics,

05:23.073 --> 05:27.544
modest little haulage company,
perfectly normal life, and then...

05:27.786 --> 05:30.005
it all went mad!

05:30.247 --> 05:33.717
Two years ago I was in town,
I was stocking up,

05:33.792 --> 05:36.341
you know, nothing special,
all the usual stuff.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.171
When all of a sudden...

05:47.430 --> 05:51.185
Shop-window dummies come to life.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.447
I survived, obviously.

06:03.989 --> 06:08.210
Twelve months later, I'm back in town.
I'm up West looking for a new suit;

06:08.285 --> 06:11.585
something nice and smart,
when I hear this plane overhead...

06:25.802 --> 06:29.147
But it wasn't over yet.
'Cause then, Christmas Day.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.772
<i>I'm in bed fast asleep, nice and cosy,
7:45 in the morning,</i>

06:32.851 --> 06:34.819
when all of a sudden...

06:37.314 --> 06:40.818
And I'm stuck in bed, all right,
'cause there's glass everywhere,

06:40.901 --> 06:42.403
and I was barefoot.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.159
I had to invent
this rudimentary pulley system

06:45.238 --> 06:49.038
just to reach my boots,
and by the time I'd done that...

06:56.541 --> 07:01.092
And that's when it all started happening.
That's howl met Ursula.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.639
His name is the Doctor.

07:02.714 --> 07:05.467
- That's how I met Victor Kennedy.
- You stupid man!

07:05.550 --> 07:08.554
- That's howl met Jackie Tyler.
- You don't meet many Eltons.

07:08.637 --> 07:11.390
And that's how I finally met the Doctor.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.522
And realised the truth.

07:23.526 --> 07:27.030
I should say this isn't,
you know, my whole life.

07:27.113 --> 07:30.162
It's not all spaceships and stuff.

07:30.241 --> 07:34.667
'Cause I'm into all sorts of things.
I like football.

07:34.746 --> 07:38.296
I like a drink. I like Spain.

07:38.375 --> 07:42.005
And if there's one thing
I really, really love,

07:42.087 --> 07:46.388
then it's Jeff Lynne
and the Electric Light Orchestra.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.810
'Cause you can't beat a bit of ELO.

08:12.075 --> 08:16.922
So, great big spaceship
hanging over London, imagine the theories.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.965
The internet went into meltdown.

08:20.375 --> 08:25.131
But I kept on digging.
Something was going on. Oh, yes.

08:25.213 --> 08:28.342
And then one day,
on some obscure little blog

08:28.425 --> 08:33.431
by someone called Ursula Blake.
It was, like, chance in a million.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.275
It was him, it was that man again.

08:38.393 --> 08:41.442
But the photo was new.
It was taken on Christmas Day,

08:41.563 --> 08:46.194
but Christmas just gone,
and he looked exactly the same.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.537
His name is the Doctor.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.330
- Doctor what?
- That's all anyone knows.

08:52.449 --> 08:55.578
At Christmas Day,
I was taking photos all over the place.

08:55.660 --> 08:59.710
I went mad with it all,
spaceships and lasers and everything.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.883
We all went to Trafalgar Square that night

09:01.958 --> 09:06.088
'cause everyone was celebrating
just being alive,

09:06.171 --> 09:09.766
and I snapped him in passing, that's all.
He was just some bloke.

09:09.841 --> 09:14.187
I didn't realise he was significant
until Mr Skinner pointed it out.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.056
Who's Mr Skinner?

09:16.765 --> 09:20.110
Oh, there's a few of us. The inner sanctum.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.483
All studying this Doctor.

09:24.022 --> 09:29.199
I've seen him, the Doctor, I swear to you.
I saw him when I was a kid.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.450
He was in my house and he was downstairs.

09:31.529 --> 09:35.079
Don't tell me, he looked
exactly the same then as he does now.

09:35.158 --> 09:38.002
Yes. Yes.

09:39.662 --> 09:43.007
Oh, my God, you believe me.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.343
I'm not the only one...

09:45.418 --> 09:48.888
[So that's haw] met Ursula.
All thanks to the Doctor.

09:48.963 --> 09:53.184
Turns out we read all the same sites
and she only lived half a mile away.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.305
She was like a proper mate. Poor Ursula.

10:00.016 --> 10:03.395
But like she said,
there was this little community,

10:03.478 --> 10:07.403
the select few,
all with their stories of the Doctor.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.576
This little gang used to meet up

10:09.692 --> 10:12.070
underneath the old library
on Maccateer Street.

10:12.195 --> 10:16.075
Mr Skinner, first name Colin,
but we always called him Mr Skinner.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.076
I don't know why, we just did.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.504
To me, the Doctor isn't a man,

10:21.579 --> 10:24.423
he's more a collection of archetypes.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.009
Then there was Bridget.

10:26.084 --> 10:28.553
All these different Doctors come and go,

10:28.628 --> 10:32.258
but the single constant factor
is this faux police box.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.601
It keeps cropping up throughout history.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.394
She lived way up north,

10:36.511 --> 10:39.765
but she travelled down without fail
just for the meetings.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.311
Then there was Bliss.

10:41.391 --> 10:45.737
What I'm trying to do
is sum up the Doctor. What he means to us.

10:45.812 --> 10:49.737
She was ever so sweet, Bliss.
Bless Bliss', we used to say.

10:49.816 --> 10:54.322
What he could represent
and what he should represent

10:54.404 --> 10:59.581
and what he never won't represent

11:00.285 --> 11:01.912
sort of thing.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.336
We should have a name.
You know, as a group.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.213
Names are very important.

11:07.292 --> 11:12.219
What we need is a good, strong name,
like a team. Something like...

11:13.089 --> 11:16.434
London Investigation 'N' Detective Agency.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.722
- LINDA for short.
- Say it again?

11:19.804 --> 11:23.980
London Investigation 'N' Detective Agency.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.776
- "N"
- Fish 'n' chips.

11:25.852 --> 11:29.231
Rock 'n' roll. Chaka Demus 'n' Pliers.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.447
Ah!

11:30.523 --> 11:33.367
- LINDA, I like it. It's not too solemn.
- I like the 'N'.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.491
- We're the men from LINDA.
- And the women.

11:35.570 --> 11:36.822
LINDA united.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.789
Did you think of that on the spot?

11:38.865 --> 11:40.993
No, I've wanted to use it for years.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.040
I give you LINDA.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.666
Linda!

11:44.746 --> 11:47.090
So we'd all meet up every week

11:47.165 --> 11:52.387
and we'd talk about the Doctor for a bit.
But after a while, Bridget started cooking.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.716
Oh, my God, that's gorgeous!
No, really. Wow.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.550
The rest of you, get your hands off!

11:57.634 --> 12:00.979
Next thing you know,
Mr Skinner started his readings,

12:01.054 --> 12:02.806
'cause he was writing his own novel.

12:02.931 --> 12:06.526
"That's the last time you ride
the Ghost Train, johnny Franzetta."

12:06.601 --> 12:09.104
"Now say your prayers!"

12:09.187 --> 12:10.814
To be continued.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.065
No!

12:12.148 --> 12:15.573
Time went on. We got to know
each other better and better.

12:15.652 --> 12:19.828
I only started all this
because my daughter disappeared.

12:21.658 --> 12:26.755
But it wasn't aliens that took her away.
It was just drugs.

12:27.538 --> 12:32.510
I come down to London every week
and I just keep looking for her.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.432
Oh, Bridget.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.185
♪ I gave my love a chicken

12:44.305 --> 12:47.525
♪ It had no bone

12:49.143 --> 12:52.067
♪ I gave my love a cherry

12:52.146 --> 12:55.400

13:00.947 --> 13:03.075
♪ You've got a brand-new key ♪

13:03.199 --> 13:06.499
Then it turned out
that Bridget could play the piano,

13:06.577 --> 13:08.671
and I confessed my love of ELO.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.420
Next thing you know, musical LINDA.

13:20.842 --> 13:24.892
♪ You got me running
Going out of my mind

13:25.054 --> 13:28.604

13:40.570 --> 13:42.038

13:44.073 --> 13:45.996
Now, careful. Mind the cables

13:59.964 --> 14:02.183
And that's when it all changed.

14:02.258 --> 14:06.980
<i>T hat Tuesday night in March.
T hat's when he arrived.</i>

14:08.931 --> 14:10.308
Lights.

14:10.391 --> 14:13.065
That's when we met
Victor Kennedy.

14:13.144 --> 14:16.114
And the golden age was gone.

14:16.189 --> 14:20.365
So, we meet at last, LINDA.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.866
Pleased to meet you, sir.
I'm sorry, was the music too loud?

14:22.945 --> 14:26.825
No, no, no. I don't shake hands.
Back, back. I suffer from a skin complaint.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.168
- Eczeema.
- Oh, you mean eczema.

14:29.243 --> 14:32.463
Oh, this is worse, much worse.
I blister to the touch.

14:32.538 --> 14:36.088
Back, back, all of you, further, further.
Thank you.

14:38.044 --> 14:42.641
Sorry, don't mind me asking,
but who are you?

14:42.715 --> 14:45.013
I am your salvation.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.352
- That's the Doctor.
- That's really him.

14:49.430 --> 14:54.527
Forgotten your purpose in life.
You, with your band and your cakes

14:54.602 --> 14:58.402
and your blubbing, and all the
while he still exists, the Doctor.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.108
Look at him. just look!

15:00.191 --> 15:04.412
Move back, move back, all of you.
Hold on, wait for this bit.

15:04.487 --> 15:07.411
The picture cuts out,
but the sound still continues.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.333
Listen.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.669
Listen to the sound of the universe.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.631
Yes.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.003
Oh, that's...

15:24.590 --> 15:27.264
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Leave him!

15:27.343 --> 15:29.641
You've heard it before, haven't you?

15:29.720 --> 15:32.974
When? When was it? Where?
Where were you?

15:33.224 --> 15:36.398
I'd forgotten. Till now.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.022
But it was that night.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.658
What night?

15:44.110 --> 15:46.158
I was just a kid.

15:47.029 --> 15:51.125
That's why I went downstairs,
it woke me up.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.249
That noise.

16:00.126 --> 16:03.426
But what is it? What does it mean?

16:03.546 --> 16:07.016
That is the sound of his spaceship.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.679
Right then, homework!
Using the Torchwood files,

16:10.761 --> 16:14.186
we're able to look at all the old databases
in a completely new light.

16:14.265 --> 16:17.394
We're able to build up
a more detailed profile of the Doctor.

16:17.477 --> 16:21.277
I've allocated tasks to each of you.
I'd like you to...

16:21.397 --> 16:24.150
Careful, watch the eczeema.

16:24.233 --> 16:28.238
I would like you to complete your targets
and meet back here this time next week,

16:28.362 --> 16:30.911
one step closer to catching the Doctor.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.618
Well, don't just sit there! Move!

16:35.453 --> 16:38.127
Um, Bliss? It is Bliss, isn't it?

16:38.247 --> 16:39.669
- Yea h.
- Yes.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.172
Could I have a word with you
in private, please?

16:42.251 --> 16:44.925
- Course you can, yeah.
- Thank you.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.632
Goodbye, goodbye.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.886
Better get to work. Lots to do.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.937
I never thought of it as work.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.483
It's what we've always wanted, though.
To find the Doctor.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.105
Yeah, I suppose.

17:01.812 --> 17:06.409
All of a sudden, without anyone saying so,
we were working for Victor Kennedy.

17:10.613 --> 17:15.743
<i>But we had to admit', he was right.
His methods were much more rigorous.</i>

17:15.867 --> 17:20.044
It felt like we were getting
closer and closer to the Doctor.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.465
- Mr Kennedy?
- Yes.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.548
We were wondering...

17:24.627 --> 17:28.051
No sign of Bliss. Do you know where she is?

17:28.631 --> 17:31.885
Yes. Didn't she tell you?
She's getting married.

17:31.968 --> 17:35.973
She left a message.
It'll never last. Stupid girl.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.479
Come on, back to work!

17:39.308 --> 17:41.060
But we did get lucky once.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.522
A police box, newly arrived.
It says newly arrived today.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.073
It's in Woolwich.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.406
Well, don't just stand there!
Move! Move! Go! Go!

17:49.485 --> 17:52.113
But don't get excited.
That's where you came in.

17:53.114 --> 17:56.960
Woolwich, police box,
red bucket, blue bucket

17:57.034 --> 17:59.457
me so stupid, etcetera.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.707
- Useless!
- I just froze.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.257
You met him and you froze?

18:03.332 --> 18:05.881
- You stupid man!
- You can't hit me 'cause you don't touch.

18:05.960 --> 18:09.009
- You get a rash and an itch and everything.
- I can use this!

18:09.088 --> 18:12.467
Use that cane on him
and you'll get one hell of a smack off me.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.720
And then a good kick.

18:14.802 --> 18:18.523
Is that completely understood,
Mr Kennedy?

18:18.598 --> 18:20.396
Duly noted.

18:20.474 --> 18:25.651
Ursula Blake, most likely to fight back.

18:28.190 --> 18:32.912
Right then, we'll change tack.
We'll approach this sideways.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.748
If we're to discover the truth
about the Doctor,

18:35.823 --> 18:39.498
then we need to try and find her.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.872
Now, when it comes to
the Doctor's companion,

18:41.996 --> 18:44.169
the Torchwood files are strangely lacking.

18:44.248 --> 18:49.596
It seems the evidence has been corrupted,
something called Bad Wolf virus.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.764
At least we've got these photographs.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.929
They're first-hand evidence. Elton?

18:54.008 --> 18:57.888
It was a London accent, definitely.
She's from London.

18:57.970 --> 19:01.520
So we hit the streets. We get out there.
We take the photograph.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.351
Someone's got to know
who she is somewhere.

19:03.434 --> 19:08.440
But London's a big place. I should know,
my own daughter's out there.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.150
Bridget, don't make this personal.

19:11.233 --> 19:14.578
I don't like to be touched literally
or metaphorically, thank you very much.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.539
I haven't got the time.
Bleeding hearts, outside.

19:17.615 --> 19:21.870
Find me that girl! Go! Now! Move!

19:23.287 --> 19:26.587
And so it began,
the impossible task.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.919
T 0 scour the mean streets.

19:29.001 --> 19:32.426
To search a major capital city
for an unknown girl.

19:32.546 --> 19:36.642
T 0 hum' down that face
in a seething metropolis of lost souls.

19:36.759 --> 19:39.603
T 0 find that one girl in ten mill/on.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.853
Oh, that's Rose Tyler.
She lives just down there.

19:42.932 --> 19:47.403
Bucknall House, number 48.
Her mother's Jackie Tyler.

19:47.478 --> 19:50.231
Nice family, bit odd.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.246
Oi, Jackie!

20:04.745 --> 20:08.625
Hello, sweetheart. I'll see you
down the Spinning Wheel tonight, yeah?

20:08.708 --> 20:10.460
Pub quiz. Get them in!

20:10.543 --> 20:12.295
All right.

20:17.842 --> 20:20.061
I'd been trained for this.

20:20.136 --> 20:24.391
Victor Kennedy's classes
covered basic surveillance and espionage.

20:24.473 --> 20:27.773
Step one, engage your target.

20:27.852 --> 20:30.981
Find some excuse to start a conversation.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.949
But how was I going to do this? Haw?

20:34.024 --> 20:38.120
Excuse me, luv, you couldn't give us a quid
for two fifties, could you?

20:38.195 --> 20:39.663
Yeah. just...

20:42.950 --> 20:44.668
Oh, lovely. Cheers.

20:45.995 --> 20:49.215
Step two, without provoking suspicion,

20:49.331 --> 20:51.834
gel' on first-name terms with the target.

20:51.917 --> 20:55.012
My name's Jackie, by the way.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.631
I'm Elton.

20:56.714 --> 21:00.764
Oh, you don't meet many Eltons, do you?
Apart from the obvious.

21:03.554 --> 21:05.227
Step three,

21:05.347 --> 21:09.227
ingratiate yourself with a joke
or some humorous device.

21:09.310 --> 21:12.405
I tell you what, Elton.
Here we are complete strangers

21:12.480 --> 21:14.528
and I'm flashing you my knickers.

21:16.525 --> 21:19.074
Step foul; find some subtle way

21:19.195 --> 21:21.618
to integrate yourself
into the target's household.

21:21.697 --> 21:25.327
Mind you, I'm only down here
'cause my washing machine's knackered.

21:25.409 --> 21:29.039
I don't suppose you're any good
at fixing things, are you?

21:29.663 --> 21:32.758
Here we are. It was the fuse.

21:32.833 --> 21:37.213
There's nothing wrong with the machine.
That's fine, all working.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.924
Oh, Elton, I should have you on tap.

21:41.383 --> 21:44.762
I used to have this little mate
called Mickey, he did all that stuff.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.724
He's gone now, bless him.

21:47.848 --> 21:50.977
Well, if you need me, give us a call.
I'll jot down my number.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.028
You do that and I'll make us a cup of tea.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.855
Go on, go and sit down.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.075
Put the telly on if you want.
I can't bear it silent.

22:06.742 --> 22:09.837
It's just me these days,
rattling about.

22:09.912 --> 22:12.506
There's my daughter,
but she's gone travelling.

22:12.581 --> 22:14.800
I keep her bedroom
all nice and ready though,

22:14.917 --> 22:16.885
just in case she comes back.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.346
- And her name is?
- Rose.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.851
That's a nice name, Rose.

22:23.926 --> 22:27.271
- So, where is she travelling?
- All over.

22:27.471 --> 22:30.099
She's got her mobile.
I get a call now and then.

22:30.224 --> 22:31.851
Not as often as I'd like.

22:31.934 --> 22:35.484
Still, at that age,
who can be bothered phoning home?

22:35.563 --> 22:36.940
Yeah.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.368
Who's she with? Is it mates, is it? Or...

22:40.442 --> 22:43.286
just mates, yeah.

22:45.406 --> 22:49.161
Well, if I had you
making a nice cup of tea like this,

22:49.243 --> 22:50.995
I wouldn't stray far from home.

22:51.078 --> 22:54.708
You're a charmer. Say it again.

22:56.959 --> 23:01.760
Magnificent! Oh, I could kiss you!
Except I can't, of course. The eczeema.

23:01.839 --> 23:05.059
- I've even got a picture of her on my phone.
- That's amazing.

23:05.134 --> 23:08.263
You've achieved steps one to four
in precise order. How did you manage it?

23:08.345 --> 23:11.189
I had to work very hard. She keeps
everything very close to her chest.

23:11.265 --> 23:12.733
That's a hell of a chest.

23:12.808 --> 23:15.812
But how do you move on?
Step five, that's the problem.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.989
Step five. That's this week's homework.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.483
I want a full plan of attack
from each of you.

23:20.608 --> 23:24.363
Now, go on! Vamoose! Avanti!
There's work to do.

23:26.030 --> 23:28.579
And, Elton, keep infiltrating.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.456
You will do anything to get
that information, boy, anything.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.162
Yes, sir.

23:34.538 --> 23:38.088
Oh... Oh, Bridget. Bridget? Oh, yes.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.630
Could I have a word with you
in private, please?

23:42.546 --> 23:44.173
Mr Skinner's giving me a lift.

23:44.298 --> 23:48.348
Oh, I can drop you at the station.
I'm sure Mr Skinner won't mind, will you?

23:48.469 --> 23:50.016
Not at all.

23:50.095 --> 23:53.395
- All right, Bridget, I'll see you next week.
- All right, then.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.193
Bye-bye.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.242
Now, Mr Skinner, I don't mean to pry,

24:03.317 --> 24:06.412
but did you give Bridget
a little kiss back there?

24:06.528 --> 24:08.280
I think I did.

24:08.364 --> 24:12.585
And if you get your way, might there be
more little kisses between the two of you?

24:12.701 --> 24:13.918
I think there might.

24:13.994 --> 24:15.667
- I knew it!
- That's brilliant.

24:15.746 --> 24:18.545
Now, let's not get excited. We'll see.

24:24.922 --> 24:28.301
Infiltration went well
'cause Jackie kept phoning up,

24:28.384 --> 24:30.432
needing this and needing that.

24:30.511 --> 24:34.141
It was strange, the amount of things
that needed doing.

24:34.223 --> 24:36.191
It's like that flat was jinxed

24:44.525 --> 24:47.654
It's weird, these fuses,
they keep on blowing.

24:47.736 --> 24:51.240
You must be near a substation
'cause then you get the power surges.

24:51.323 --> 24:54.418
Still, there we go. Fixed!

24:55.828 --> 24:59.958
Here we are.
A little reward for my favourite handyman.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.255
I shouldn't really, I've
got the car outside.

25:02.376 --> 25:06.756
You could always splash out on a taxi,
or whatever.

25:08.257 --> 25:09.679
See what happens.

25:10.551 --> 25:11.643
Right.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.221
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

25:17.933 --> 25:22.154
- Very nice. What's that, French?
- I suppose so.

25:22.563 --> 25:25.863
They know how to do things, the French.

25:26.483 --> 25:29.407
Is it from Rose? I mean, is she in France?

25:29.486 --> 25:31.705
My daughter won't be coming back tonight,

25:31.780 --> 25:35.751
just in case you're wondering.
We've got the place to ourselves.

25:36.493 --> 25:37.619
Right.

25:41.999 --> 25:44.843
- Nice music.
- Il Divo.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.086
Yeah.

25:47.296 --> 25:50.596
You were saying... Power surges.

25:50.674 --> 25:54.224
- From the substation, yeah.
- Is that why it gets so hot in here?

25:54.303 --> 25:56.397
- Is it hot?
- Oh, I think so.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.600
- You should take your jacket off.
- No, I'm fine.

25:58.682 --> 26:00.650
No, look, you must be boiling.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.854
Oh, look at your shirt! Sorry!

26:02.978 --> 26:04.696
I'm fine, it's all right.

26:04.772 --> 26:06.945
- I've ruined it.
- No, honestly, it's fine.

26:07.024 --> 26:11.450
- Take it off, I'll put it in the wash.
- Oh, come on, it's only a little drop.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.121
Oops.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.911
There now.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.162
Ruined.

26:18.368 --> 26:21.872
And there I wag
the ultimate step five.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.832
The perfect infiltration.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.340
Target, Jackie Tyler.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.545
Attaboy!

26:30.255 --> 26:34.180
You're right, it is a bit hot,
but it's about to get hotter.

26:34.259 --> 26:38.935
I'll see you soon. All
right, be careful. Bye.

26:42.935 --> 26:46.064
- Everything all right?
- That was my daughter.

26:47.731 --> 26:52.737
Oh, look at you. I'm sorry.
I was just being stupid.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.532
- Is she okay?
- She's so far away.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.745
I get left here sometimes

27:01.954 --> 27:04.173
and I don't know where she is.

27:04.248 --> 27:07.127
Anything could be
happening to her, anything.

27:07.668 --> 27:09.887
And I just go a bit mad.

27:12.214 --> 27:14.342
Oh, put your shirt back on.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.563
Where is she?

27:19.638 --> 27:21.231
Doesn't matter.

27:22.933 --> 27:26.688
I'm sorry. You better go.

27:31.733 --> 27:33.781
Actually...

27:33.902 --> 27:37.076
Ana' that's when it struck me.

27:37.197 --> 27:40.326
Funny the things you think of
with your shirt of)'.

27:40.409 --> 27:43.913
But that's when I realised
what was really important.

27:44.621 --> 27:48.467
Never mind about Rose.
I'm not even gonna ask.

27:48.792 --> 27:51.011
And I will put my shirt back on

27:51.086 --> 27:54.090
because I'm gonna go out
and get us both a pizza.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.676
'Cause I reckon you need cheering up.

27:56.758 --> 27:59.853
She goes swanning off
and who's left to care about you, eh?

27:59.928 --> 28:03.398
So I say, nice bit of pizza.
We'll put the telly on nice and loud,

28:03.473 --> 28:07.478
we'll annoy that woman next door,
just you and me, as proper mates.

28:07.603 --> 28:10.106
Yea h? Mates.

28:10.189 --> 28:13.318
Go on, say yes.

28:14.735 --> 28:15.952
Yes.

28:18.697 --> 28:22.201
<i>All of a sudden,
a [at of things made sense.</i>

28:22.284 --> 28:26.334
I '0' got so lost in conspiracies
and aliens and targets,

28:26.455 --> 28:28.457
I'd been missing the obvious.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.338
'Cause I did like Jackie,

28:30.459 --> 28:33.303
but I liked someone else even more.

28:57.611 --> 29:02.993
Right. Let's get inside, then.
The pizza's getting cold.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.918
I went in your coat.

29:05.661 --> 29:09.336
For once in my life I thought, "I'll pay."
I thought, "He's such a nice man,

29:09.456 --> 29:13.256
"he won't accept anything
so I’ll just slip a tenner in his pocket."

29:13.335 --> 29:15.008
And look what I found.

29:16.505 --> 29:18.599
A photograph of my daughter.

29:18.674 --> 29:21.018
No, no, no. It's not like that.
I can explain.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.187
- I bet you can.
- I wasn't being pervy or anything.

29:23.303 --> 29:25.647
I wasn't after her.

29:25.722 --> 29:28.396
- I was looking for the Doctor.
- Oh, I know that.

29:28.475 --> 29:31.820
I worked that out.
'Cause it's never me, is it?

29:31.895 --> 29:34.068
No, but that's how it started,
but I changed my mind.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.241
Let me tell you something.

29:36.358 --> 29:41.205
About those who get left behind.
Because it's hard.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.578
And that's what you become, hard.

29:43.699 --> 29:48.580
But if there's one thing I've learnt,
it's that I will never let her down

29:49.204 --> 29:52.799
and I'll protect them both
until the end of my life.

29:52.874 --> 29:56.924
So whatever you want,
I'm warning you, back off.

29:57.004 --> 29:59.382
But, Jackie, I only wanted to meet him.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.466
- I thought you liked me.
- I do.

30:01.550 --> 30:04.804
Just get out of here! I said get out!

30:04.886 --> 30:07.014
And leave me alone!

30:15.397 --> 30:16.944
She was right. It's shameful.

30:17.065 --> 30:19.159
- We used that woman.
- I knew I couldn't trust you!

30:19.234 --> 30:22.408
You broke cover. You stupid little man,
you failed step five.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.952
I don't care about step five!

30:25.073 --> 30:29.078
'Cause it's all gone wrong, Mr Kennedy,
ever since you turned up.

30:29.703 --> 30:33.048
We used to come here every week
and we'd have a laugh.

30:34.291 --> 30:35.964
We were friends.

30:36.043 --> 30:39.297
No wonder they stopped coming.
I mean, there's no Bliss anymore,

30:39.379 --> 30:41.131
and even Bridget, she hasn't turned up.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.304
I've been phoning and phoning,
there's no reply.

30:43.383 --> 30:47.809
Who can blame her?
I'm sorry, Victor, but you're on your own,

30:47.929 --> 30:52.309
'cause I am leaving
and so are you, Mr Skinner.

30:53.352 --> 30:56.731
And as for you, Ursula,
you're coming with me.

30:56.813 --> 30:59.817
And we're going to the Golden Locust
and we're gonna have a Chinese.

30:59.900 --> 31:03.825
- What's that got to do with it?
- I mean, you and me. Together.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.534
Having a meal. If you want.

31:09.368 --> 31:12.372
Oh, I'd love it.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.423
But you can't leave.

31:15.499 --> 31:18.503
You'll never know
what he was doing, the Doctor.

31:18.585 --> 31:22.385
You'll never know what he was doing
in your house all those years ago.

31:22.464 --> 31:25.092
No, I'll never know.

31:28.303 --> 31:33.230
Ursula, get your stuff.
Mr Skinner, are you coming?

31:34.309 --> 31:37.404
Not to the Chinese if you don't mind.
Just sort of walking out.

31:37.479 --> 31:39.322
I certainly am.

31:40.649 --> 31:45.325
Victor, good luck. Goodbye.

31:46.905 --> 31:50.955
Mr Skinner, would you stay
for a minute, please?

31:51.034 --> 31:52.251
We're walking out.

31:52.327 --> 31:55.877
I've got numbers for Bridget.
I've kept records. I've got old numbers.

31:55.956 --> 31:59.460
We could track her down together,
you and I.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.588
That's more like the old team spirit.

32:02.671 --> 32:04.093
You two have a nice time.

32:04.172 --> 32:06.675
- I hope you find her.
- I'll email you.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.767
Just come a little closer.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.522
- I love prawns. Crispy aromatic duck.
- Do you?

32:17.602 --> 32:19.275
Oh, I left my phone.

32:20.021 --> 32:21.864
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.487
It's not in my pocket.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.535
- So much for the big exit.
- Yeah.

32:25.652 --> 32:27.404
Come on, hurry up.

32:34.369 --> 32:38.044
I'm not stopping, I just left my... phone.

32:39.541 --> 32:42.385
- Victor?
- Take your phone and go.

32:43.086 --> 32:45.054
Where's Mr Skinner?

32:45.380 --> 32:47.553
He's gone to the toilet.

32:48.550 --> 32:53.397
But we haven't got toilets,
we have to use the pub on the corner.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.566
Well, that's where he is, then.

32:55.724 --> 32:57.567
Help me!

32:59.728 --> 33:02.356
- What was that?
- It was nothing. It was nothing!

33:02.439 --> 33:04.533
- Help me!
- Shut up!

33:04.608 --> 33:06.155
That's Mr Skinner.

33:06.234 --> 33:09.738
Victor, look at your hands.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.289
Look at the rest of me.

33:15.410 --> 33:20.507
You've dabbled with aliens,
now meet the genuine article.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.005
Oh, my God!

33:23.919 --> 33:27.423
- You're a thing.
- A thing?

33:27.631 --> 33:30.601
This thing is my true form.

33:30.759 --> 33:34.013
Better than that crude pink shape
you call a body.

33:34.095 --> 33:39.272
What happened? Where am I?
Ursula, is that you?

33:39.935 --> 33:43.610
That's Mr Skinner.
What have you done to him?

33:43.730 --> 33:45.653
I've absorbed him.

33:45.732 --> 33:49.282
- Colin? Is that you? Colin?
- Bridget, my love.

33:49.402 --> 33:52.076
Oh, my God! That's Bridget.

33:52.155 --> 33:56.626
- Colin, where are you?
- I'm here, Bridget. It's all right, I'm close.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.837
You've absorbed them both.

33:58.912 --> 34:01.210
What about Bliss? Where is she?

34:03.083 --> 34:04.209
What?

34:04.292 --> 34:07.136
I said you really don't want to know.

34:07.254 --> 34:12.476
You've absorbed them.
You're some sort of absorbathon!

34:13.009 --> 34:14.636
An absorbaling.

34:15.971 --> 34:19.100
- An Abzorbaloff.
- Yes, I like that.

34:19.181 --> 34:21.981
Let them go. I'm ordering you.

34:22.060 --> 34:26.815
- Let those people go.
- Oh, but they taste so sweet.

34:26.940 --> 34:30.661
Just think about the Doctor.
Ooh, how will he taste!

34:30.819 --> 34:34.197
All that experience, all that knowledge.

34:34.322 --> 34:38.577
And if I've got to absorb Jackie Tyler
to get to him, then so be it.

34:38.659 --> 34:40.583
Don't you dare!

34:41.830 --> 34:43.706
If I have to beat them out of you!

34:43.790 --> 34:46.464
Oh! Oh! No, no, please don't hit me!

34:46.543 --> 34:50.422
Look at me,
I'm such a slow and clumsy beast.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.599
Please don't hit me.

34:55.135 --> 34:57.809
Well, then. Give them back.

34:57.887 --> 35:00.515
What, you mean like this?

35:02.142 --> 35:05.237
Just one touch! That's all it takes!

35:09.024 --> 35:12.699
No. Oh, no, no.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.450
'No!
'No!

35:14.529 --> 35:16.873
- Leave her alone!
- Don't touch me.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.495
Oh, Elton.

35:18.575 --> 35:22.205
I'm so sorry you can't touch me.

35:22.495 --> 35:24.168
Ursula.

35:24.247 --> 35:27.376
Most likely to fight back indeed.

35:27.459 --> 35:28.802
Leave her alone!

35:43.808 --> 35:44.900
Yes!

35:44.976 --> 35:47.104
No, that's not fair!

35:48.229 --> 35:49.902
She tastes like chicken.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.867
Elton, where are you?

35:54.361 --> 35:58.161
Please. Mr Kennedy, please.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.542
I'm asking you.

36:00.617 --> 36:04.417
I'm begging you, give her back to me.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.089
I can't.

36:06.164 --> 36:09.964
Once they've been absorbed,
the process is irreversible.

36:10.794 --> 36:15.425
Wait a minute. Now I've been absorbed,
I can read his thoughts.

36:16.132 --> 36:20.228
Oh, my God! Elton, you're next.

36:20.303 --> 36:22.271
Get out of here.

36:22.347 --> 36:25.271
Now you've seen him, he can't let you go.

36:25.350 --> 36:30.026
Just run. Go on, never mind me. Get out!

36:30.105 --> 36:31.823
Isn't she the clever one?

36:31.898 --> 36:35.118
- Run, Elton! Run!
- Save yourself, boy!

36:35.193 --> 36:37.036
Run for your life!

37:00.427 --> 37:04.523
Oh, what's the matter?
Have you given up so soon?

37:04.597 --> 37:08.192
There's no point. Where would I go?

37:09.853 --> 37:13.357
- Everything I ever wanted...
- Has been absorbed.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.659
Oh, Elton. Don't say that.

37:16.067 --> 37:21.073
- But it's true.
- Then join us. join us, little man.

37:21.156 --> 37:22.499
Come on.

37:22.615 --> 37:26.165
It's everlasting peace. Come on, join us.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.087
Dissolve into me.

37:50.518 --> 37:52.691
Someone wants a word with you.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.617
You upset my mum.

37:58.860 --> 38:01.704
A great big absorbing creature
from outer space

38:01.780 --> 38:05.080
- and you're having a go at me?
- No one upsets my mum.

38:05.200 --> 38:09.250
At last. The greatest feast of all,
the Doctor.

38:09.370 --> 38:12.874
Interesting. A sort of absorbatrix...

38:13.208 --> 38:16.963
- Absorbaklon... Abzorbaloff...
- Abzorbaloff, yes!

38:17.045 --> 38:20.219
Is it me or is he a bit Slitheen?

38:20.298 --> 38:24.144
- Not from Rexicoricophalvitorius, are you?
- No. I'm not that swine!

38:24.219 --> 38:27.519
I spit on them!
I was born on their twin planet.

38:27.597 --> 38:30.771
Really? What's the twin planet
of Rexicoricophalvitorius?

38:30.850 --> 38:32.568
- Clom.
- Clom?

38:32.685 --> 38:35.154
Clom. Yes, and I'll
return there victorious,

38:35.230 --> 38:38.154
once I possess your travelling machine.

38:38.233 --> 38:40.656
- Well, that's never gonna happen.
- Oh, it will.

38:40.735 --> 38:45.241
You'll surrender yourself to me, Doctor,
or this one dies.

38:45.406 --> 38:50.003
You see, I've read about you, Doctor.
I've studied you. So passionate.

38:50.078 --> 38:54.504
So sweet.
You wouldn't let an innocent man die.

38:54.582 --> 38:58.553
And I'll absorb him
unless you give yourself to me.

39:01.297 --> 39:06.474
Sweet, maybe. Passionate, I suppose.
But don't ever mistake that for nice.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.764
Do what you want.

39:11.766 --> 39:14.269
- He'll die, Doctor.
- Go on, then.

39:18.106 --> 39:19.779
So be it.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.202
Mind you,
the others might have something to say.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.120
- Others?
- He's right!

39:24.237 --> 39:27.081
The Doctor's right! We can't let him.

39:27.407 --> 39:29.375
Oh, Mr Skinner.

39:29.450 --> 39:33.796
- Bridget, pull! For God's sake, pull!
- No! No!

39:33.913 --> 39:36.883
If it's the last thing we ever do.

39:36.958 --> 39:40.303
Bliss! All of us, together, come on!

39:40.587 --> 39:44.763
- Pull! LINDA united!
- Stop it! Stop!

39:44.841 --> 39:46.639
Pull!

39:50.805 --> 39:53.558
Elton! The cane, break it!

39:55.643 --> 39:59.147
My cane! You stupid man!

40:06.988 --> 40:10.834
- What did I do?
- The cane created a limitation field.

40:11.743 --> 40:16.590
Now it's broken, he can't stop.
The absorber is being absorbed.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.007
By What?

40:20.293 --> 40:21.670
By the Earth.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.011
Bye-bye, Elton.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.689
Bye-bye.

40:42.231 --> 40:43.699
Who was she?

40:46.361 --> 40:48.034
That was Ursula.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.348
And that's it.

41:08.257 --> 41:12.603
Almost. Because the Doctor
still had more to say.

41:12.679 --> 41:16.229
- You don't remember, do you?
- And then he explained.

41:16.349 --> 41:19.774
That night, all those years ago.

41:20.603 --> 41:23.573
There was a shadow in your house.

41:24.941 --> 41:27.865
<i>A living shadow in the darkness.</i>

41:27.944 --> 41:31.289
An elemental shade that
had escaped from the Howling Halls.

41:31.990 --> 41:36.587
I stopped it,
but I wasn't in time to save her.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.749
I'm sorry.

41:47.088 --> 41:50.342
Because that was the night
my mother died.

42:31.966 --> 42:34.264
We forget because we must.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.986
So, there you go.

42:44.103 --> 42:46.777
Turns out
I've had the most terrible things happen,

42:46.856 --> 42:48.984
and the most brilliant things,

42:49.150 --> 42:52.825
and sometimes, well,
I can't tell the difference.

42:52.904 --> 42:57.250
They're all the same thing.
They're just me.

42:57.325 --> 43:00.329
You know, Stephen King said once, he said,

43:00.411 --> 43:05.008
"Salvation and damnation
are the same thing."

43:05.083 --> 43:07.586
And I never knew what he meant.

43:08.503 --> 43:10.346
But I do now.

43:11.339 --> 43:15.765
'Cause the Doctor might be wonderful,
but thinking back,

43:15.843 --> 43:19.723
I was having such a special time,
just for a bit.

43:20.181 --> 43:22.149
I had this nice little gang.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.943
And they were destroyed.

43:28.731 --> 43:30.733
It's not his fault.

43:31.484 --> 43:34.613
But maybe that's what happens
if you touch the Doctor,

43:35.530 --> 43:37.658
even for a second.

43:39.283 --> 43:42.162
I keep thinking of Rose and Jackie,

43:42.245 --> 43:45.215
and how much longer
before they pay the price.

43:45.331 --> 43:47.834
Oh, now don't get all miserable.

43:47.917 --> 43:51.296
- Come on, Elton. You've still got me.
- Oh, yeah.

43:52.964 --> 43:58.016
'Cause the Doctor said he could do
one last thing with his magic wand.

43:58.094 --> 44:02.816
If I can key into the absorption matrix
and separate the last victim.

44:02.890 --> 44:06.315
It's too late for total
reconstruction, but...

44:08.062 --> 44:10.781
Elton! Fetch a spade!

44:10.898 --> 44:14.323
Even then, after all that,

44:14.402 --> 44:17.121
the Doctor saved me one last time.

44:24.662 --> 44:27.040
- Here she is.
- Could be worse.

44:27.123 --> 44:32.175
At least I'll never age. And it really
is quite peaceful. You'd be surprised.

44:32.253 --> 44:37.054
It's a relationship of sorts.
But we manage.

44:38.843 --> 44:42.438
- We've even got a bit of a love life.
- Oh, let's not go into that.

44:42.513 --> 44:45.232
And I don't care what anyone thinks,

44:46.184 --> 44:47.527
I love her.

44:48.311 --> 44:49.654
Oh.

44:52.356 --> 44:54.404
But the thing is...

44:55.610 --> 44:58.329
There you are,
I even bought a remote zoom.

45:00.531 --> 45:02.954
But what I wanted to say is,

45:04.076 --> 45:06.170
you know, when you're a kid,

45:06.287 --> 45:09.791
they tell you that it's
all grow up, get a job,

45:09.916 --> 45:14.797
get married, get a house,
have a kid and that's it.

45:18.341 --> 45:22.812
But the truth is,
the world is so much stranger than that.

45:23.554 --> 45:28.481
It's so much darker and so much madder.

45:31.145 --> 45:33.568
And so much better.

45:39.904 --> 45:42.327
- 30th Olympiad.
- That's great!

45:45.993 --> 45:47.995
- They're not safe.
- They're in the garden.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.997
Get them in, I'm begging you.

45:50.081 --> 45:53.085
In the last six days,
three of your children have been stolen.

45:56.045 --> 45:58.139
We need to find the source of that power.

45:58.214 --> 45:59.934
These? They're kids' pictures. Now get out!

46:00.007 --> 46:01.384
Chloe has a power.

46:01.509 --> 46:03.603
- She's using it to snatch the kids.
- Get out!

46:05.263 --> 46:06.765
If living things can become drawings,

46:06.847 --> 46:09.350
then maybe drawings
can become living things.
