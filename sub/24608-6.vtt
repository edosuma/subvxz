00:00.024 --> 00:01.964
Previously on Genius...

00:01.964 --> 00:03.132
Move in with me.

00:03.133 --> 00:05.935
Think how wonderful it would be.

00:09.273 --> 00:11.643
This is Géry Pieret.

00:11.644 --> 00:14.046
Consider these a
token of our new friendship.

00:14.047 --> 00:16.242
You stole them, from the Louvre?

00:16.242 --> 00:17.510
I liberated them.

00:17.511 --> 00:19.412
But there is a
small delivery fee.

00:19.413 --> 00:20.813
50 francs.

00:20.814 --> 00:22.181
Opium.

00:22.182 --> 00:24.230
Have you tried it?
I want to make you happy.

00:24.231 --> 00:25.431
At least for a little while.

00:25.432 --> 00:26.966
I am not your prisoner.

00:26.967 --> 00:28.167
I made a mistake.

00:28.168 --> 00:29.502
I don't know what I
would do if I lost you.

00:29.503 --> 00:34.039
Pablo Picasso,
meet Henri Matisse.

00:34.040 --> 00:37.510
I see you've already
met, uh, Monsieur Braque.

00:37.511 --> 00:39.545
He is the youngest of the
Wild Beasts, as they call us.

00:39.546 --> 00:41.347
What do you want?

00:41.348 --> 00:43.048
You haven't surfaced in months.

00:43.049 --> 00:44.583
Why do you care, Braque?

00:44.584 --> 00:45.951
We barely know each other.

00:45.952 --> 00:47.219
I would like to change that.

00:47.220 --> 00:48.621
I really do admire your work.

00:48.622 --> 00:50.556
Oh, it's ghastly, Pablo.

00:50.557 --> 00:54.059
That is the most astute art
critique you have ever given, Gertrude.

00:54.327 --> 00:55.761
Congratulations.

00:55.762 --> 00:58.730
You said you wanted to
offend, you've done it.

01:48.730 --> 01:49.679
So?

01:49.680 --> 01:54.501
What is it like living with the
most famous artist in the world?

01:54.502 --> 01:58.104
We work. We go to museums.
We laugh.

01:59.073 --> 02:01.441
And does he ask you
to cook and clean for him?

02:01.442 --> 02:03.459
Huh, like a good little wife?

02:03.460 --> 02:05.227
Of course not.

02:05.228 --> 02:06.729
We make each other happy.

02:06.730 --> 02:08.630
Right.

02:08.631 --> 02:12.602
You get the rich old mentor and, uh,
he gets the pretty young mistress.

02:13.570 --> 02:16.972
You're determined to be cynical.

02:16.973 --> 02:19.508
Well, I have no money.

02:19.509 --> 02:21.643
Have no fame.

02:21.644 --> 02:25.746
I just have the nagging
thought that, mmm,

02:25.747 --> 02:30.628
I should have kissed you the first
time I saw you at Rozsda's.

02:31.293 --> 02:33.886
I had no idea
you even noticed me.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.523
He's so old.

02:37.524 --> 02:41.222
Ah. Does he take lots of naps?

02:43.926 --> 02:46.561
He's got
more energy than I do. Mm-hmm.

02:46.562 --> 02:47.962
Oh. Really?

02:47.963 --> 02:49.664
He works all night.

02:49.665 --> 02:54.180
And then at dawn, he comes to bed
and we make love all morning.

02:55.504 --> 02:58.439
So, Luc, tell me about Tunisia.

02:58.541 --> 03:01.142
Well, I'll be teaching
a small art school in Tunis.

03:01.143 --> 03:03.852
I'm looking forward to
getting out of Paris.

03:03.853 --> 03:06.521
You should come and
visit some time.

03:07.223 --> 03:09.924
You and the old man.

03:15.664 --> 03:17.365
Pack your bags!

03:17.366 --> 03:20.264
Where are we going?

03:20.265 --> 03:21.765
To the Midi.

03:21.766 --> 03:27.696
Fresh air, sunshine, long
lunches and lazy afternoons.

03:27.697 --> 03:30.297
- That sounds lovely.
- Hmm.

03:30.298 --> 03:32.604
But I'm finally settled
into a good routine here.

03:32.605 --> 03:35.593
Ooh, to be settled
is the death of an artist.

03:35.594 --> 03:37.053
Mm-hmm.

03:37.054 --> 03:38.653
Well, I'm
getting a lot of work done.

03:38.654 --> 03:41.945
Well, you can work there.

03:42.620 --> 03:44.323
Sounds like
you've made up your mind.

03:44.324 --> 03:46.619
Well, you could resist me.

03:46.620 --> 03:50.153
But, uh, what
would be the point?

04:03.072 --> 04:05.597
When you said the Midi,
I thought you meant the beach.

04:05.611 --> 04:10.067
Oh. The sea is, uh, not far.
It's 80 kilometers that way.

04:21.055 --> 04:24.323
I better pick up some
groceries before the shops close.

04:24.324 --> 04:25.923
I'll go with you.

04:25.924 --> 04:27.384
No, no. Stay with me.

04:27.385 --> 04:30.411
I want to show you
the rest of the house.

04:30.412 --> 04:36.137
Would you mind, um,
getting some ham and cheese? Bread?

04:36.533 --> 04:39.141
Oh, uh, and five or six eels.

04:39.142 --> 04:43.928
And also, I, I, I would need onions,
and, uh, butter, sugar, salt pork,

04:44.255 --> 04:46.746
uh, flour and celery.

04:46.968 --> 04:50.259
Yeah, okay, yeah, well.

04:50.759 --> 04:53.493
Do you like eels?

04:56.012 --> 04:57.888
Not particularly.

04:57.889 --> 05:01.528
Ah, but in my
stew, you will love them.

05:05.194 --> 05:07.106
You cook, I'll, uh, I'll clean.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.810
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:08.811 --> 05:11.107
If you clean up, I won't
be able to find anything.

05:11.108 --> 05:14.327
Just, just leave it like that.

05:17.890 --> 05:22.989
So that meant to shock.
To challenge.

05:23.316 --> 05:26.432
I would like to exhibit
it in my gallery.

05:27.733 --> 05:30.815
Once it's finished.

05:31.455 --> 05:36.450
It is finished, you should go.

05:37.090 --> 05:38.584
Pablo...

05:38.585 --> 05:42.293
I'm sure Herr Kahnweiler
meant no offense.

05:42.933 --> 05:45.632
Thank you so much for coming.

05:45.716 --> 05:47.454
I'm sorry I upset him.

05:47.455 --> 05:52.450
No. He's always upset.
It is, uh, part of his charm.

05:59.281 --> 06:02.920
Did you have to be so rude?

06:02.968 --> 06:04.497
I liked him.

06:04.498 --> 06:08.150
Well he certainly felt it.

06:08.151 --> 06:10.167
I cannot recommend him enough.

06:10.168 --> 06:14.016
He's honest, discerning, and he's
buying up all the most innovative work.

06:14.064 --> 06:16.937
You mean like Matisse?

06:17.020 --> 06:19.441
Among others.

06:20.186 --> 06:23.337
You have not told me
what you think of it yet.

06:26.203 --> 06:30.071
It reminds me of El Greco.

06:30.099 --> 06:32.359
The reflection of
form is similar.

06:32.360 --> 06:40.585
But where El Greco believed in grace,
this has a savage, apocalyptic power.

06:40.812 --> 06:43.546
It is completely new.

06:43.629 --> 06:46.330
But I am sorry, Pablo,
as it was for poor

06:46.331 --> 06:49.738
El Greco, it will be
years before people

06:49.739 --> 06:53.007
understand what you have done.

06:56.013 --> 06:59.546
So they'll appreciate
me when I'm dead and buried.

07:06.621 --> 07:08.011
Go easy on that.

07:08.012 --> 07:10.585
I never go easy.

07:10.586 --> 07:12.776
On anything.

07:12.777 --> 07:14.245
You know, you don't have to live

07:14.246 --> 07:15.733
in squalor and chaos
to make great art.

07:15.734 --> 07:17.785
Who are you to
tell me how to live?

07:17.786 --> 07:20.081
You have got to clean up.

07:20.082 --> 07:21.983
Get out of this slum
before you go mad like

07:21.984 --> 07:24.594
van Gogh, slice off
your ear and die in

07:24.595 --> 07:27.024
a gutter somewhere.

07:30.656 --> 07:34.364
It's time for you to go.

07:36.430 --> 07:40.138
Matisse needs his paints mixed.

07:49.717 --> 07:51.942
- Ready? Set.
- Ah...

07:51.943 --> 07:55.059
- Yeah. Ah!
- Go.

07:57.855 --> 08:02.434
-Ah, oh, how?

08:04.594 --> 08:07.386
How on earth did you
do that, Weigels?

08:07.387 --> 08:10.529
My mother taught me.
She's an alcoholic.

08:10.530 --> 08:11.316
Uh-huh?

08:11.317 --> 08:13.368
The trick is
to open your throat.

08:13.369 --> 08:18.203
So your father must
be a very happy man, huh?

08:18.204 --> 08:20.555
Max!

08:33.822 --> 08:36.903
Uh, I love it.

08:38.587 --> 08:41.738
Why?

08:42.203 --> 08:48.033
Well, the colors,
the sense of movement, the...

08:48.395 --> 08:50.377
Oh, stop pretending, Karl.

08:50.378 --> 08:53.459
Everyone hates it.

08:55.213 --> 08:57.668
Pablo.

08:59.978 --> 09:06.385
Pablo, I believe your dipsomaniacal,
debauched new neighbor has, uh,

09:06.386 --> 09:08.638
the perfect remedy
to lift your spirits.

09:08.639 --> 09:11.060
Huh?

09:21.265 --> 09:24.381
Pass me the pipe.

09:33.926 --> 09:35.142
How much?

09:35.143 --> 09:37.946
Two francs.

09:44.291 --> 09:47.316
You, you can have it for five
francs, Monsieur Picasso.

09:47.317 --> 09:49.020
The canvas is good.

09:49.021 --> 09:52.138
You can paint right over it.

09:52.534 --> 09:55.373
Are you mad?

09:56.570 --> 09:59.547
It's a masterpiece.

09:59.561 --> 10:01.995
The artist, you know him?

10:01.996 --> 10:05.808
Artist?
He's, he's a customs clerk.

10:05.821 --> 10:07.490
Henri Rousseau.

10:07.491 --> 10:10.538
You know where I can find him?

10:14.830 --> 10:16.603
Monsieur Rousseau?

10:16.604 --> 10:17.855
Pablo Picasso.

10:17.856 --> 10:20.012
I, I wrote to you.

10:20.013 --> 10:22.816
Yeah. Come in.

10:25.996 --> 10:28.452
How are things in Cairo?

10:28.639 --> 10:32.186
I think you may have
confused me with someone else.

10:32.187 --> 10:38.636
No, come in, I had no idea
you Egyptians were so timorous.

10:40.779 --> 10:43.791
Guillaume, what
are you doing here?

10:44.013 --> 10:45.717
What does it look like?

10:45.718 --> 10:48.048
We are having our portrait done.

10:48.049 --> 10:51.222
Pablo, allow me to
introduce my new paramour

10:51.223 --> 10:56.378
and companion in chaos,
Marie Laurencin.

10:58.552 --> 11:01.335
You are aware
he's an utter degenerate?

11:01.336 --> 11:03.839
That's why I
fell in love with him.

11:06.692 --> 11:11.344
Monsieur Picasso, would
you care to assess my progress?

11:22.310 --> 11:26.539
A perfect likeness,
wouldn't you say?

11:27.492 --> 11:33.428
Yes, you've
captured them exactly.

11:36.326 --> 11:38.204
That old idiot's a joke.

11:40.292 --> 11:41.972
If you feel that way, why are

11:41.997 --> 11:43.839
you paying him to paint your portrait?

11:43.840 --> 11:46.413
Our love is a mad thing.

11:46.414 --> 11:51.004
It must be immortalized
by an utter madman.

11:51.005 --> 11:53.335
I'm going to
hang it above my chamber pot.

11:53.336 --> 11:56.243
Everybody deserves a good
laugh when they take a piss.

11:58.066 --> 12:00.778
You two are
wrong about, Rousseau.

12:00.779 --> 12:04.048
The way he distorts proportions,
uses unnatural colors.

12:04.049 --> 12:06.760
His work is strange.

12:06.761 --> 12:08.709
Primitive.

12:08.710 --> 12:10.378
He does not care
what people think.

12:10.379 --> 12:14.621
Least of all two
barbarians like you.

12:17.753 --> 12:21.705
You, my friend, have
been smoking too much opium.

12:23.110 --> 12:26.504
You wasted our money on that?

12:27.735 --> 12:31.547
It cost less than
all the perfume you bought.

12:33.927 --> 12:37.808
And I suppose it's better
than your big ugly whore painting.

12:41.997 --> 12:44.570
I'm going to throw
Rousseau a huge party.

12:44.571 --> 12:46.030
Invite everyone.

12:46.031 --> 12:48.661
Drinks, entertainment, a feast.

12:48.883 --> 12:51.387
You complain about me
buying a few bottles of perfume,

12:51.388 --> 12:54.692
now you want to host a
banquet for some nobody.

12:54.693 --> 12:57.508
He's worked in
obscurity for years.

12:57.509 --> 12:59.804
But he's a genius.

12:59.805 --> 13:03.408
It's just nobody
realizes it yet.

13:07.145 --> 13:10.330
He deserves to be celebrated.

13:13.162 --> 13:16.627
Are you talking
about him, or you?

13:39.214 --> 13:43.804
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing our most honored guest,

13:43.805 --> 13:46.505
Monsieur Henri Rousseau!

13:49.615 --> 13:51.283
Your highness.

13:51.284 --> 13:53.474
Oh.

13:53.475 --> 13:57.253
What a gorgeous goddess
descended from Olympus is this?

13:57.475 --> 13:59.735
Uh, Fernande.

13:59.736 --> 14:01.579
Uh, daughter of Bacchus.

14:01.580 --> 14:05.522
God of wine, revelry
and, uh, madness.

14:05.523 --> 14:07.305
Oh.

14:07.631 --> 14:10.970
You and I shall
be great friends.

14:10.971 --> 14:13.565
Uh, Picasso asked me to compose

14:13.566 --> 14:15.921
some lines in your honor, Monsieur.

14:16.536 --> 14:24.250
"Look how young the city is and
you still only a toddler...

14:26.171 --> 14:28.988
"You the lovely lily...

14:28.989 --> 14:31.109
A red-haired flame...

14:31.110 --> 14:33.823
A vain peacock...

14:36.849 --> 14:39.457
You listening to this twaddle?

14:39.458 --> 14:42.171
Look, his masterpiece.

14:42.172 --> 14:45.718
"And desperation...

14:45.719 --> 14:50.679
The brandy you sip
burns in your throat...

14:50.693 --> 14:55.966
Let the sun beheaded be."

15:03.493 --> 15:07.444
Friends, gods, and serfs.

15:08.814 --> 15:16.419
Only with love can we live and,
uh, only with joy can we work.

15:16.420 --> 15:18.727
All hail the customs clerk!

15:23.250 --> 15:25.781
And only with vegetables can

15:25.782 --> 15:28.431
we make palaces for kings and queens.

15:35.562 --> 15:37.927
Quite a party.

15:37.928 --> 15:40.327
Where's Matisse?

15:40.328 --> 15:43.422
Must have a colorful
painting to finish.

15:43.423 --> 15:45.753
Needs to organize his pigments.

15:45.754 --> 15:48.279
Uh-huh.

15:49.928 --> 15:51.596
My goodness, Henri!

15:51.597 --> 15:52.988
Monsieur.

15:52.989 --> 15:56.014
It seems my brains are on fire.

15:56.015 --> 15:58.866
No. No, no, no, my dear.

15:58.867 --> 16:03.075
I love my crown.

16:04.641 --> 16:06.727
He's a daft as a dandelion.

16:06.728 --> 16:08.263
If canvas wasn't so abrasive,

16:08.264 --> 16:09.892
I would cut up his picture and use it

16:09.893 --> 16:11.840
to wipe my ass.

16:11.841 --> 16:14.102
I have seen your work, Weigels.

16:14.103 --> 16:17.254
That man is a true artist.

16:17.754 --> 16:19.319
A master.

16:19.320 --> 16:23.201
You are nothing but a fraud.

16:26.172 --> 16:28.084
I cannot thank you enough.

16:28.085 --> 16:31.214
I am the one who
should be thanking you.

16:31.215 --> 16:33.301
You've inspired me.

16:33.302 --> 16:35.250
Ohh...

16:35.251 --> 16:38.228
You discovered me.

16:38.415 --> 16:41.566
And in one night, you
brought sweetness

16:41.567 --> 16:45.684
and glory to a lifetime of struggle.

16:49.546 --> 16:53.601
I hope this happens
to you someday.

16:56.085 --> 16:59.271
We are the best
painters in the world.

17:00.329 --> 17:06.193
Me in the modern style,
and you in the Egyptian.

17:19.842 --> 17:22.575
Jesus.

17:49.910 --> 17:53.270
First Casagemas, now Weigels.

17:55.476 --> 17:58.835
What are you talking about?

18:01.180 --> 18:06.939
I abandoned Carles,
and I insulted Weigels.

18:09.145 --> 18:12.645
It's my fault again.

18:14.711 --> 18:17.701
He was...

18:17.702 --> 18:20.136
a sweet soul.

18:20.137 --> 18:22.223
Harmless.

18:22.224 --> 18:23.962
And I was cruel to him.

18:23.963 --> 18:26.431
He was a calamity.

18:26.432 --> 18:29.966
Don't blame yourself.

18:39.476 --> 18:42.349
What are you doing?

18:43.580 --> 18:46.397
Braque was right.

18:46.398 --> 18:49.723
No more of this.

18:56.345 --> 18:59.774
Maybe if we smoke just a little.

19:06.607 --> 19:09.966
Think of Spain.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.693
The mountains.

19:12.694 --> 19:15.705
And the blue sky.

19:17.911 --> 19:21.688
Close your eyes.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.693
Ah!

19:32.694 --> 19:35.531
God, what?

19:35.580 --> 19:39.080
What's going on?

19:39.233 --> 19:42.627
Oh.

19:43.685 --> 19:45.179
Oh, my God.

19:45.180 --> 19:46.710
They're everywhere.

19:46.711 --> 19:49.006
You, you know
that I am a Scorpio.

19:49.007 --> 19:52.088
It's my zodiac sign. Yeah.

19:52.138 --> 19:54.119
It's not funny.
They're poisonous.

19:54.120 --> 19:57.006
Dora was stung once.

19:57.007 --> 19:58.258
She's still alive.

19:58.259 --> 20:00.102
You came here with Dora?

20:00.103 --> 20:01.492
Yeah, of course.

20:01.493 --> 20:04.123
This is her house.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.276
Wasn't it nice
of her to lend it to us?

20:08.277 --> 20:10.815
Oh, yes. I'm so grateful.

20:10.816 --> 20:12.171
Uh, where are you going?

20:12.172 --> 20:14.975
To get a broom.

20:16.972 --> 20:18.989
Hey, Françoise,
Françoise, Françoise...

20:18.990 --> 20:21.006
Leave it.

20:21.007 --> 20:27.313
It's just that you have to
learn to be, um, more messy.

20:27.859 --> 20:32.118
Relax, come back to bed.

20:32.119 --> 20:33.458
I'm not sleeping in there.

20:33.459 --> 20:34.988
Not with these things.

20:34.989 --> 20:36.832
We can sleep in another room.

20:36.833 --> 20:40.227
Just choose one.

20:40.485 --> 20:42.779
It's all the same to me.

20:42.780 --> 20:46.732
As long as I am with you.

20:50.294 --> 20:53.167
Ah, all right.

21:08.973 --> 21:11.914
Is this messy enough for you?

21:16.172 --> 21:18.467
You really cleaned up?

21:18.468 --> 21:22.888
Yes and unlike Van Gogh,
I still have both my ears.

21:26.051 --> 21:28.402
Come in.

21:39.825 --> 21:43.533
My God.

21:44.451 --> 21:47.475
You've been busy.

21:47.476 --> 21:50.176
What do you think?

22:04.520 --> 22:08.228
It's completely new.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.824
It is because of you.

22:11.825 --> 22:13.668
You inspired me.

22:13.669 --> 22:15.674
Your brothel painting, it showed me

22:15.699 --> 22:17.817
how to, uh, see things differently.

22:26.990 --> 22:31.214
For 400 years, art
has failed to evolve

22:31.215 --> 22:33.748
because of this obsession
with perspective.

22:35.304 --> 22:37.250
But it's a trick of the eye.

22:37.251 --> 22:41.133
The vanishing point, it takes
everything away from the viewer.

22:41.599 --> 22:43.685
Yes. You're right.

22:43.686 --> 22:48.150
What we must do is make
the vanishing point vanish.

22:57.147 --> 22:59.476
That is exactly
what I've been trying to do.

22:59.477 --> 23:03.359
I knew if anybody would
grasp it, it would be you.

23:03.512 --> 23:06.816
We must do more than
challenge the rules of perspective.

23:06.817 --> 23:10.990
All the rules, light,
color, form...

23:10.991 --> 23:13.146
must be questioned.

23:13.147 --> 23:17.202
We have to rip everything apart
to create a new kind of painting.

23:17.216 --> 23:19.650
We should submit our
work to the Autumn Salon.

23:19.651 --> 23:22.120
Start the revolution.

23:22.121 --> 23:25.216
Matisse is a judge this year.

23:25.217 --> 23:29.446
Anything I put forward,
he will dismiss.

23:31.338 --> 23:34.316
You submit.

23:34.364 --> 23:35.685
You are throwing
me to the lions?

23:35.686 --> 23:37.251
No.

23:37.252 --> 23:38.815
You're his protégé.

23:38.816 --> 23:42.246
Whatever you show,
he will like it.

23:42.260 --> 23:44.432
And imagine how angry
he is going to be

23:44.457 --> 23:47.514
when he realizes that
by approving of you,

23:49.409 --> 23:52.264
he will be approving of me.

23:59.095 --> 24:02.941
You are working
with Picasso, aren't you?

24:03.443 --> 24:07.255
The angular planes,
the distortion...

24:09.495 --> 24:13.250
I see that horrific
painting of his here.

24:13.251 --> 24:15.790
We are trying
to do something new.

24:15.791 --> 24:19.059
You just don't understand it.

24:19.060 --> 24:23.859
I'm sorry, George, but
I cannot recommend this work.

24:27.617 --> 24:29.529
Matisse is an idiot.

24:29.530 --> 24:31.616
You have to admit, Pablo.

24:31.617 --> 24:33.668
These new paintings
you're doing...

24:33.669 --> 24:36.972
they aren't easy to understand.

24:36.973 --> 24:38.921
You're taking his side?

24:38.922 --> 24:41.668
Of course not.

24:41.669 --> 24:44.995
I just don't want you to
be disappointed again.

24:45.704 --> 24:51.012
You worked so hard on that
and look what happened.

24:54.260 --> 24:57.516
I can't work here.

25:01.009 --> 25:03.268
It's no good.

25:03.269 --> 25:07.269
I tried to be looser, like
you told me to, and I...

25:07.270 --> 25:10.155
I can't find the form in it.

25:10.156 --> 25:12.068
It's just lying there.

25:12.069 --> 25:15.012
Lifeless.

25:15.130 --> 25:21.648
If your work doesn't give
you trouble, it won't be good.

25:25.391 --> 25:27.059
What are those horns?

25:27.060 --> 25:29.114
They are calling
us to a celebration.

25:29.115 --> 25:33.260
It's Bastille Day. Yeah, let's go.
Huh? Come on, let's...

25:33.261 --> 25:35.606
- I've got to work out...
- Ah, let's have some fun.

25:35.607 --> 25:37.553
Do it later. Yeah?

25:37.554 --> 25:40.441
Pablo, I can't whip off
two masterpieces a day like you.

25:40.442 --> 25:43.785
You think too much.

25:43.786 --> 25:46.995
You're, you're, you're
torturing yourself

25:46.996 --> 25:49.109
with, uh, with critical thought.

25:49.110 --> 25:51.524
You need an adventure.

26:05.764 --> 26:08.428
What are you doing?

26:08.790 --> 26:11.906
Joining them.

26:20.414 --> 26:21.874
What am I supposed to do?

26:21.875 --> 26:25.194
Great, uh, it's just for men.

26:25.195 --> 26:26.327
Stay here.

26:26.328 --> 26:27.780
I'll be back, enjoy yourself!

26:27.781 --> 26:32.080
You asked me to come with you!

26:45.068 --> 26:47.432
Do you think it's finished?

26:47.433 --> 26:50.737
Absolutely.

26:50.738 --> 26:52.616
It is your best yet.

27:01.347 --> 27:05.542
She wrote
to say she could not marry me.

27:05.555 --> 27:06.980
I'm so sorry.

27:06.981 --> 27:09.902
I know how fond of her you are.

27:09.903 --> 27:14.627
But don't worry, Henri,
you'll find someone else.

27:14.628 --> 27:15.919
Huh.

27:17.353 --> 27:20.239
Be happy you have
Pablo, my dear.

27:20.240 --> 27:23.961
Sometimes
I'm not sure that I do.

27:23.962 --> 27:26.222
He's been away for weeks.

27:26.223 --> 27:28.517
Never writes back.

27:28.518 --> 27:34.085
I'm sure he's, uh, busy working.

27:34.571 --> 27:37.213
If he can pick up a
brush, why can't he pick up a pen?

27:37.214 --> 27:40.852
But he is in a forest of
creation, full of thorn thickets

27:41.180 --> 27:44.031
and clawed beasts.

27:44.032 --> 27:47.148
But he will follow the
bread crumbs back to you.

27:48.032 --> 27:51.914
And everything
will be good again.

28:05.006 --> 28:07.522
I'll take that one, that one

28:07.547 --> 28:10.128
and the one to the right of the door.

28:14.153 --> 28:17.074
You actually like them?

28:17.075 --> 28:19.648
Like them?

28:19.649 --> 28:25.432
Pablo, you've
reinvented painting.

28:32.832 --> 28:35.300
What do you
think, Mr. Kahnweiler?

28:35.301 --> 28:38.870
I'll take the other 25.

28:38.954 --> 28:41.527
That's quite a gamble, isn't it?

28:41.528 --> 28:43.300
Not at all.

28:43.301 --> 28:47.914
One day these will
hang in the Louvre.

29:40.588 --> 29:42.918
My God, Pieret.

29:42.919 --> 29:45.248
Aren't you
going to invite me in?

29:45.249 --> 29:47.983
Uh, Marie!

29:49.006 --> 29:56.128
Um, allow me to introduce a long,
lost friend of mine, Géry Pieret.

29:56.937 --> 30:01.040
That is quite an outfit.

30:01.041 --> 30:03.648
It's what everyone
wears in America these days.

30:03.649 --> 30:05.771
So, what
brings you back to Paris?

30:05.772 --> 30:07.892
Ah, all kinds of opportunities.

30:07.893 --> 30:12.658
But while they come to fruition, I
was hoping I could stay with you.

30:14.294 --> 30:19.451
Uh, my life
is a bit more crowded now.

30:20.380 --> 30:23.253
But I brought you a gift.

30:24.032 --> 30:25.875
Only a few days.

30:25.876 --> 30:29.131
I promise.

30:42.432 --> 30:45.527
Don't touch me.

30:45.528 --> 30:48.645
What's wrong?

30:49.668 --> 30:51.093
You whisked me out of Paris,

30:51.117 --> 30:52.588
where I was perfectly
happy, to go to the

30:52.589 --> 30:55.348
Midi, and it's not the real Midi, it's

30:55.373 --> 30:58.397
some horrid village
stuck in a mountain.

30:58.398 --> 30:59.928
You keep telling me to be looser,

30:59.953 --> 31:01.736
which is just making me doubt myself.

31:01.737 --> 31:03.607
And then you drag me off to some

31:03.632 --> 31:05.945
stupid party and you abandon me there.

31:05.946 --> 31:10.418
I'm sorry, Françoise.

31:11.685 --> 31:14.905
Let me make it up to you.

31:17.007 --> 31:19.775
Just go blow your own bugle.

31:47.014 --> 31:50.026
Who do you know in Tunisia?

31:54.145 --> 31:55.396
A friend of mine.

31:55.397 --> 31:56.857
Hmm.

31:56.858 --> 31:59.048
He's teaching there.

31:59.049 --> 32:02.548
Why don't you read it out loud?

32:02.667 --> 32:05.518
Well, it's addressed to me.

32:05.519 --> 32:10.374
I don't mind
sharing my mail with you.

32:11.397 --> 32:16.183
For example, this one
is from Marie-Thérse.

32:20.302 --> 32:24.531
"My darling Pablo, the
weather was lovely today.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.501
I love you so much.

32:27.502 --> 32:29.448
I wish you were here.

32:29.449 --> 32:31.393
But at least every day that goes by

32:31.418 --> 32:34.304
without you is one day closer to me

32:34.305 --> 32:36.566
seeing you again."

32:39.536 --> 32:42.583
It's so beautiful.

32:47.675 --> 32:51.883
Sounds to me like
she's still in love with you.

32:51.884 --> 32:55.314
Well, it's not my
fault she cannot get over me.

32:56.824 --> 32:59.257
Yes, Pablo. Nobody can top you.

32:59.258 --> 33:01.065
Mm.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.101
I bet you're fighting
her off every time you see her.

33:03.102 --> 33:05.239
No.

33:05.240 --> 33:08.579
But she used to be insatiable.

33:08.580 --> 33:10.839
Never turned me down once.

33:10.840 --> 33:13.100
Maybe you
should run back to her.

33:13.101 --> 33:14.875
Well, unfortunately,

33:14.876 --> 33:17.831
I have some business in Marseille
today with Kahnweiler.

33:17.832 --> 33:19.905
Happy painting.

34:13.449 --> 34:15.059
Is this supposed to make

34:15.083 --> 34:16.857
up for you abandoning me all summer?

34:16.858 --> 34:21.463
If you prefer the slums,
we can stay in the Bateau-Lavoir.

34:27.259 --> 34:30.966
Can we really afford all this?

34:31.224 --> 34:34.318
My work is selling.

34:34.319 --> 34:37.658
Everyone likes my
cubist paintings.

34:37.659 --> 34:40.427
Except you.

34:45.623 --> 34:48.253
Good morning, Madame.

34:54.041 --> 34:57.506
I always dreamed of
living in a place like this.

35:01.832 --> 35:05.645
Maybe things will
be different between us now.

35:14.632 --> 35:17.054
What is it?

35:21.415 --> 35:24.080
Mona Lisa
stolen, Mona Lisa stolen!

35:24.302 --> 35:26.582
I hear your
newspaper is offering

35:26.607 --> 35:28.753
a reward for information
leading to the

35:28.754 --> 35:32.184
painting's recovery.

35:32.303 --> 35:35.036
You know something?

35:35.676 --> 35:38.631
Do you guarantee my anonymity?

35:38.632 --> 35:40.754
Why, because you stole it?

35:40.755 --> 35:44.705
No, but I can tell you how the
thief or thieves may have done it.

35:46.702 --> 35:49.645
I've stolen from
the Louvre, too.

35:54.216 --> 35:57.575
I took this a few weeks ago.

36:00.615 --> 36:04.115
I stole other works as well.

36:04.581 --> 36:08.914
I can give you details of guard
shifts, locks and service entrances,

36:09.868 --> 36:13.576
a broken basement window.

36:16.407 --> 36:18.145
The bastard
told them everything.

36:18.146 --> 36:20.267
At least the paper
didn't disclose his name.

36:20.268 --> 36:22.597
But the police will
figure it out soon enough.

36:22.598 --> 36:24.981
And then they'll be on
to you for the statue

36:24.982 --> 36:26.560
he gave you, and me for those Iberian

36:26.561 --> 36:27.511
pieces he sold me.

36:27.512 --> 36:29.275
We'll tell the police
we didn't know they were stolen.

36:29.276 --> 36:30.911
It will be our word
against Pieret's.

36:30.912 --> 36:33.067
You're missing the point.

36:33.068 --> 36:35.547
In the article, Pieret
says an international

36:35.572 --> 36:37.310
crime ring stole the Mona Lisa.

36:37.311 --> 36:39.432
It's an absurd fabrication
to cover up his own exploits.

36:39.433 --> 36:41.276
You and I are not French.

36:41.277 --> 36:43.223
We both have art
stolen from the Louvre.

36:43.224 --> 36:47.975
They'll accuse us of stealing
the goddamn Mona Lisa, too.

36:50.807 --> 36:53.658
We should flee. Go to Spain.

36:53.659 --> 36:56.720
No. If you run, you look guilty.

36:56.721 --> 36:58.354
It's the Mona Lisa.

36:58.355 --> 36:59.885
They will hunt you
all over the world.

36:59.886 --> 37:01.623
Let's just dump
the statues in the Seine.

37:01.624 --> 37:02.624
No.

37:02.816 --> 37:05.353
As far as we know, the
police have already

37:05.378 --> 37:07.537
identified Pieret and made him talk.

37:07.538 --> 37:11.015
They could be watching us.

37:11.016 --> 37:14.863
If they catch us with those
things, we'll go to prison.

37:15.955 --> 37:20.081
What if we return the
statues to the newspaper?

37:20.547 --> 37:23.085
They kept Pieret's
name out of it.

37:23.086 --> 37:26.341
They'll do the same for us.

37:28.268 --> 37:31.780
You get too agitated.

37:31.781 --> 37:34.702
I will do it.

37:34.703 --> 37:37.610
Alone.

37:41.799 --> 37:43.955
I didn't know what else to do.

37:43.956 --> 37:47.537
When Pieret gave them to me, I had
no idea that they were stolen.

37:47.538 --> 37:50.702
He said he bought them
at a shop in Montmartre.

37:50.703 --> 37:53.276
It was only when I read your
article that I became suspicious

37:53.277 --> 37:54.981
of their true origin.

37:54.982 --> 37:58.389
Why bring them
to me rather than the police?

37:58.390 --> 38:01.102
Since your paper
has an interest in this case.

38:01.103 --> 38:03.085
And since the honorable
thing clearly is for us...

38:03.086 --> 38:05.924
Us?

38:06.460 --> 38:08.546
It was a slip of the tongue.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.944
For, for me to return
them to the museum,

38:10.969 --> 38:12.998
I have brought them to you with the

38:12.999 --> 38:16.866
expectation that you will do
so and leave me out of it.

38:29.173 --> 38:33.020
Admit you stole the Mona
Lisa and all this will be over.

38:35.782 --> 38:38.563
Who are your accomplices?

38:49.695 --> 38:52.428
Pablo Picasso?

38:58.289 --> 39:02.021
Where were you on the
morning of August 21st?

39:04.520 --> 39:05.423
At home.

39:05.424 --> 39:09.665
Monsieur Apollinaire has given a
sworn statement that you were with him

39:09.666 --> 39:13.443
at the Louvre,
stealing the Mona Lisa.

39:21.458 --> 39:24.796
He is mistaken.

39:24.797 --> 39:26.953
I was not there.

39:26.954 --> 39:29.048
Monsieur Apollinaire has also

39:29.073 --> 39:31.369
confessed to being
part of a crime ring,

39:31.370 --> 39:35.496
comprised of you,
Monsieur Géry Pieret.

39:35.753 --> 39:37.318
I don't know
anything about that!

39:37.319 --> 39:40.170
Do not interrupt me, Monsieur.

39:40.171 --> 39:41.908
I'm sorry.

39:41.909 --> 39:46.035
How long have you
known Monsieur Apollinaire?

39:52.901 --> 39:56.122
I do not know him.

40:02.710 --> 40:07.287
In fact, I have
never even met him.

40:25.597 --> 40:29.039
The examining judge
has decided not to charge you.

40:29.040 --> 40:31.670
You are free to go.

40:32.067 --> 40:35.287
What about Apollinaire?

41:23.858 --> 41:27.496
Françoise?

41:42.467 --> 41:45.157
Françoise,

41:47.578 --> 41:50.774
where could she have gone?

41:50.775 --> 41:54.210
She grew up, left you.

41:54.536 --> 41:56.275
Huh.

41:56.276 --> 41:59.636
Go get the car.

42:05.041 --> 42:09.126
We have come a long way since
your opium days at the Bateau-Lavoir.

42:09.667 --> 42:12.506
Maybe too far.

42:12.693 --> 42:15.496
Sometimes I wish I could
live as a poor man again.

42:16.415 --> 42:19.706
But with lots of money.

42:19.754 --> 42:23.336
May I introduce Pablo
Picasso and George Braque,

42:23.337 --> 42:25.214
the founders of
the cubist movement.

42:25.215 --> 42:27.927
It's an honor to meet you both.

42:27.928 --> 42:30.710
Hoffman is a
distinguished collector in Berlin.

42:30.711 --> 42:34.036
That's Picasso over there.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.275
Is it?

42:36.276 --> 42:39.997
He's a hard man to get close to.

42:39.998 --> 42:43.162
Yes, he is.

42:43.163 --> 42:46.454
Are you an artist?

42:47.475 --> 42:50.975
I used to be a model.

42:51.998 --> 42:55.371
You have lovely lines.

42:55.372 --> 42:58.801
I am a woman, not a boat.

43:02.885 --> 43:06.801
Maybe I could
paint you sometime.

43:15.998 --> 43:19.357
Glad you came, my friend.

43:19.441 --> 43:23.371
I decided I can't
hide out at home forever.

43:23.372 --> 43:27.184
Waiting for the
world to forgive me.

43:27.337 --> 43:28.901
You were released.

43:28.902 --> 43:31.232
From lack of evidence.

43:31.233 --> 43:36.597
To the press, that points to a failure
on the part of the Sûreté and not to

43:36.598 --> 43:39.253
my actual innocence.

43:44.172 --> 43:48.519
It's good to see you, my friend.

43:48.520 --> 43:51.705
Is it?

43:58.364 --> 44:01.375
Hold on, stop, stop here.

44:02.015 --> 44:04.588
Darling, darling, darling.

44:04.589 --> 44:06.779
I don't understand.

44:06.780 --> 44:08.415
Where, where the...

44:08.416 --> 44:10.015
Where on earth are you going?

44:10.016 --> 44:11.510
Marseille.

44:11.511 --> 44:14.189
But I told you
I was coming back.

44:14.190 --> 44:16.797
Not to be with you.

44:16.798 --> 44:18.814
To catch a ferry to Tunisia.

44:18.815 --> 44:22.537
To, to be with
your teacher friend?

44:22.538 --> 44:25.041
You told me
I needed an adventure.

44:25.042 --> 44:26.537
I'm taking your advice.

44:26.538 --> 44:29.145
But the adventure is here.

44:29.146 --> 44:32.471
With me, don't you see?

44:34.259 --> 44:35.997
You...

44:35.998 --> 44:38.989
You went through so much, you know,
gave up so much to be with me.

44:38.990 --> 44:42.189
Now you are just
going to run off?

44:42.190 --> 44:45.724
Before we have time to
build a life together?

44:47.720 --> 44:50.293
In Paris, we were doing that.

44:50.294 --> 44:54.454
Here we're just strangers.

44:54.503 --> 44:57.633
Then let's tell
each other everything.

44:57.634 --> 45:01.911
Until we don't even need
to used words anymore.

45:01.912 --> 45:06.799
We can just say what we need
with our eyes and our hands.

45:09.773 --> 45:15.604
You wanted to go to the beach,
so let's go to the beach.

45:38.434 --> 45:41.237
He died alone.

45:48.555 --> 45:52.158
We shouldn't have ridiculed him.

45:59.234 --> 46:02.155
Do you ever wish things
could go back to the way they were?

46:02.156 --> 46:04.693
What do you mean?

46:04.694 --> 46:11.185
We used to have fun together,
but now Pablo is always with Braque.

46:12.242 --> 46:15.128
Despair, my dear, is a readily

46:15.129 --> 46:19.533
treatable affliction. Come.

46:29.912 --> 46:31.511
What are you doing?

46:31.512 --> 46:33.946
I just want to feel good again.

46:33.947 --> 46:35.929
Give the pipe to me.

46:35.930 --> 46:37.980
You don't
know how lonely I feel.

46:37.981 --> 46:40.715
Give it to me!

46:43.164 --> 46:45.598
You ignore me.

46:45.599 --> 46:47.129
You ignore your friends.

46:47.130 --> 46:48.555
You betrayed Guillaume.

46:48.556 --> 46:50.572
He told them I
stole the Mona Lisa.

46:50.573 --> 46:54.329
The police beat him up!

46:54.330 --> 46:58.085
I am sorry about that.

46:58.086 --> 47:00.590
But denying him was the
only way to clear my name.

47:00.591 --> 47:03.164
What about
Guillaume's good name, huh?

47:03.165 --> 47:04.868
You know the newspapers
still haunt him?

47:04.869 --> 47:08.103
He let that maniac Pieret
back into his life and mine.

47:08.104 --> 47:10.711
So it's all his fault.

47:10.712 --> 47:13.911
I worked hard to get here.

47:13.912 --> 47:20.549
And I am not going to let Guillaume,
you, or anyone else make a mess of it.

47:22.608 --> 47:24.764
So that's how it is now?

47:24.765 --> 47:29.551
As long as we don't get in your
way, you'll keep us around?

48:20.347 --> 48:28.027
I, I've been thinking, uh,
we should create something together.

48:30.156 --> 48:34.136
I always hoped
we would collaborate.

48:35.165 --> 48:39.116
Maybe something bigger.

48:40.939 --> 48:43.846
More lasting.

48:45.843 --> 48:49.412
Let's make a baby.

49:02.825 --> 49:05.523
