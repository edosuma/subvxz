08:25.173 --> 08:27.046
"Eh, it's a show about
a guy who runs fast."

08:27.071 --> 08:29.496
So when I went to the
show, I didn't show up like,

08:29.598 --> 08:31.398
"Let me show you people
how to make 'The Flash.'"

08:31.500 --> 08:32.966
Like, they know how to make "The Flash."

08:33.068 --> 08:35.335
I showed up, I was like,
"Tell me how you do this.

08:35.437 --> 08:39.139
How do you make a show this good
23 times in a row every year?"

08:39.241 --> 08:41.041
Seriously, as fans of the comic,

08:41.143 --> 08:43.076
as fans of the TV show,
you're doing an amazing job.

08:43.178 --> 08:44.244
That's generous of you.

08:44.346 --> 08:46.179
- Amazing job.
- Very ge... very generous of you.

08:46.281 --> 08:48.348
What, uh, what's it like
playing an evil genius, though?

08:48.450 --> 08:50.062
It's... it's tremendous.

08:50.087 --> 08:51.575
I-I love playing the villain.

08:51.653 --> 08:53.320
It's always so much fun to do that.

08:53.422 --> 08:55.224
This one was a well-crafted one

08:55.249 --> 08:56.423
with some... with some great history.

08:56.525 --> 08:58.958
And I think Stan Lee was
one of the guys that said

08:58.983 --> 09:00.560
that the antagonist has to be...

09:00.662 --> 09:02.329
- worthy of the protagonist.
- Mm-hmm.

09:02.431 --> 09:03.930
If it's just a bad guy,

09:04.032 --> 09:05.532
it's like, well then,
the good guy's gonna win.

09:05.634 --> 09:08.735
But if the bad guy has
some charisma and swagger,

09:08.837 --> 09:11.838
and despite yourself, you kinda
like watching what he's doing,

09:11.940 --> 09:14.007
now you want to watch the battle.

09:14.109 --> 09:16.895
And you get to put on
a yellow super-suit.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.476
[laughter]

09:18.547 --> 09:20.280
Well, listen, guys,
thanks for having me.

09:20.305 --> 09:21.358
This is unbelievable.

09:21.383 --> 09:22.782
Before you go, though,

09:22.885 --> 09:24.518
we'd love to give you a a little gift

09:24.620 --> 09:25.719
from the Stash to you.

09:25.821 --> 09:27.354
- No. What?
- Yeah.

09:27.456 --> 09:29.422
Do we still have any of those
things that just came in?

09:29.447 --> 09:30.715
- You know?
- Yeah, we got them.

09:30.740 --> 09:32.229
- Hold on a second.
- Okay.

09:32.254 --> 09:34.020
The Stash did right by him.

09:34.396 --> 09:38.473
We, uh, we presented him
with a very special gift.

09:39.098 --> 09:41.635
Ah, a Funko Pop! Reverse-Flash figure.

09:41.737 --> 09:44.538
No. Too kind. Are you kidding me?

09:44.640 --> 09:46.468
Walt, you guys. This is tremendous.

09:46.493 --> 09:48.570

09:48.595 --> 09:49.852
Doesn't that terrify you?

09:49.877 --> 09:51.048

09:51.149 --> 09:53.601
- Gentlemen, thank you.
- Thank you.

09:53.703 --> 09:55.102
- Real, real pleasure.
- It's all my pleasure.

09:55.205 --> 09:56.671
My little friend and I
are going to head out.

09:56.773 --> 09:58.439

- Come back any time.

09:58.541 --> 10:00.341
- Awesome, yes.
- Cheers, gentlemen.

10:00.443 --> 10:03.244
Now you're never gonna be able
to believe that he's so evil

10:03.346 --> 10:04.679
'cause he's such a sweetheart.

10:04.781 --> 10:06.047
That's how the rich get richer.

10:06.149 --> 10:07.706

10:07.731 --> 10:08.993

- Ooh.

10:14.357 --> 10:16.023
These are really in beautiful shape.

10:16.048 --> 10:17.786
By the king, Jack Kirby.

10:18.540 --> 10:20.079
Having peeked behind the curtain,

10:20.104 --> 10:21.942
directing an episode of "The Flash,"

10:22.044 --> 10:23.984
can you reveal any
trade secrets, like...

10:24.009 --> 10:25.575
Absolutely. I saw on the script it says,

10:25.600 --> 10:26.653
"Barry zoops in."

10:26.678 --> 10:28.077
I asked Bob Crippen, the AD,

10:28.179 --> 10:29.445
I was like, "What is this? 'Zoops'?"

10:29.547 --> 10:32.011
And he goes, "That's when The
Flash comes in a room real fast."

10:32.096 --> 10:33.916
And I was like, "I've been
reading comics my whole life.

10:34.019 --> 10:36.253
"I've never seen the term
'zoops'. If anything, it's 'zoom.'"

10:36.261 --> 10:38.372
And he goes, "Oh, well,
the director of the pilot,

10:38.397 --> 10:39.729
"he wasn't a big comic book guy.

10:39.832 --> 10:41.298
"He didn't know the world very much,

10:41.400 --> 10:42.966
"so he'd come to set and he'd be like,

10:43.060 --> 10:44.412
"'All right, the fast
guy is gonna zoop in here

10:44.437 --> 10:46.102
"'and he'll zoop over there
and he'll zoop over there.'"

10:46.127 --> 10:49.146
"And the writers just started
writing zoop into the scripts."

10:49.171 --> 10:51.775
How they accomplish
it is Grant in the suit

10:51.877 --> 10:54.744
just walks into the doorway
and just stands there.

10:54.847 --> 10:55.979
And then they go, "Action, Grant."

10:56.081 --> 10:57.614
And Grant goes, "What did I miss?"

10:57.716 --> 10:58.882
- And the scene begins.
- [laughter]

10:58.984 --> 11:01.151
And that little jump is the zoop.

11:01.253 --> 11:04.131
So a digital artist will come
in and remove him from the frame,

11:04.156 --> 11:05.455
and then put lightning there,

11:05.557 --> 11:07.924
and then he'll be there for
the last three frames for this,

11:08.026 --> 11:10.727
and that's him stopping,
and then the scene goes on.

11:10.829 --> 11:12.796
But if you end a scene
with him zooping out,

11:12.898 --> 11:14.331
like, everything's real tense.

11:14.433 --> 11:15.899
It'd be like, "You
gotta save him, Barry."

11:16.001 --> 11:17.133
He's like, "I'm on it," and he'll go...

11:17.236 --> 11:19.269
and then he just has to walk out because

11:19.371 --> 11:21.464
- he's not really fast in real life.
- [laughter]

11:21.512 --> 11:24.330
It is sad to watch. He's
like... looks like Charlie Brown.

14:20.623 --> 14:22.966

14:22.991 --> 14:25.692

just trying to survive, right?

14:32.334 --> 14:34.000

14:34.102 --> 14:35.935
Wasn't trying to get...
get his world back.

14:36.037 --> 14:37.737

14:39.775 --> 14:41.274

15:40.037 --> 15:42.191
A-and I hope that, you
know, you... you keep in mind

15:42.216 --> 15:43.949
all those wonderful
things we said about you.

15:44.051 --> 15:45.284
Sure.

15:45.386 --> 15:46.452
I was thinking, like, 50 bucks.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.053
- Whoa.
- Yeah. I mean, I ca...

15:48.156 --> 15:50.089
I could flip this one
quick. This is number 1.

15:50.191 --> 15:51.624
- Yeah.
- And make my money back.

15:51.726 --> 15:53.793
But then, you know, getting
rid of the 2 through 5

15:53.895 --> 15:55.027
is gonna be difficult.

15:55.129 --> 15:56.595
Everybody wants just number 1.

15:56.697 --> 16:00.214
Yeah. I mean, how about $150?

16:00.902 --> 16:02.902
No, I can't do it, my friend.

16:02.927 --> 16:06.071
Uh, I could do $70, and that
is going to be my ceiling.

16:06.096 --> 16:07.373
I think you're getting a
good deal for $70 for these.

16:07.475 --> 16:09.475
- $70, really?
- Yeah.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.777
Uh, I'll... I'll do the
$70. That's fine. You guys...

16:11.879 --> 16:14.017
- Okay, $70?
- Yeah, you guys rock.

16:15.540 --> 16:16.947
$70.

16:16.972 --> 16:18.697
All right. Thank you so much.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.755
I assume that these were tested
and... and approved methods

16:22.780 --> 16:24.823
of exercise to give
you a superhero's body.

16:24.848 --> 16:25.868
Absolutely not.

16:28.002 --> 16:29.836

Oh, I'm gonna fall.

- Hey, guys. How you doing?
- Hey, how are ya?

16:48.824 --> 16:52.392
I got this, um, book from 1976.

16:52.417 --> 16:55.117
"The Mighty Marvel
Strength and Fitness Book."

16:55.142 --> 16:57.356
Oh, I remember seeing this
on the stands at bookstores.

17:04.512 --> 17:06.373
- I had that book.
- You did.

17:06.474 --> 17:09.076
- Yeah.
- I never was able to convince

17:09.178 --> 17:12.512
my mom to buy it, but I
assume that these were tested

- Absolutely not.
- No, I don't think so.

17:17.419 --> 17:19.019
- No?
- Yeah, there's some weird ones

17:19.121 --> 17:20.587
in there. Like hair pulling.

17:20.689 --> 17:22.021
<i>Yeah, that's the hair pulling exercise</i>

17:22.124 --> 17:23.490
<i>right on the cover there.</i>

17:23.592 --> 17:24.825
This is Medusa from the Inhumans.

17:24.926 --> 17:26.926
- Yeah.
- And she's thinking to herself,

17:27.029 --> 17:29.763
"This can't compare with the
pulling my hair usually gets."

17:29.865 --> 17:32.594
Which is kind of a lot dirtier
than I'm sure she meant it.

17:32.619 --> 17:35.353
No. It's exactly as dirty
as it was meant to be.

17:35.378 --> 17:38.149
"Usually" is in bold. That's on purpose.

17:38.174 --> 17:39.695
- Yeah, but I...
- Give me this.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.276
[laughter]

17:41.343 --> 17:44.578
I'm a sucker for the
oddball piece of merchandise,

17:44.680 --> 17:45.913
you know, from, like, the big two.

17:46.015 --> 17:48.081
Like when Marvel did toilet paper, uh...

17:48.184 --> 17:50.050
- We've seen that here. Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:50.152 --> 17:54.688
So when the 1970s "Marvel
Fitness Book" comes in,

17:54.790 --> 17:56.290
I mean, I gotta have it.

17:56.392 --> 17:58.525
Well, the fact that it has
the word "fitness" in it,

17:58.627 --> 18:01.334
of course, makes it
alien to me to begin with.

18:01.359 --> 18:03.430
- They put out an exercise book?
- Yeah.

18:03.455 --> 18:06.300
It's funny 'cause when you think
of people who are in good shape,

18:06.402 --> 18:09.136
you don't really think about
comic book writers or artists.

18:09.238 --> 18:11.601
That's not the first
people that come to mind.

18:11.626 --> 18:12.707
[laughter]

18:12.741 --> 18:14.374
All right, let's see some
of the exercises in here.

18:14.476 --> 18:16.555
- Okay.
- "The Torchie Twist."

18:16.580 --> 18:17.713
- Step back and I'll read...
- Okay.

18:17.738 --> 18:18.837
- I'll tell you what you gotta do.
- All right.

18:18.862 --> 18:20.205
You gotta "stand on your right foot..."

18:20.230 --> 18:21.914
- Okay.
- "... and turn the heel...

18:21.954 --> 18:23.517
"of your wrong foot..."

18:23.593 --> 18:26.394
in parentheses, "sometimes
known as your left foot..."

18:26.427 --> 18:28.875
- Is that a joke? I... is it? Okay.
- I think so.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.946
- [laughter]
- Okay, "... out as far as you can."

18:30.978 --> 18:33.064
- Okay.
- "Then turn your left heel in

18:33.095 --> 18:34.361
- "as far as possible."
- Okay.

18:34.463 --> 18:35.993
Oh, lo... oh, yeah, you
guys got it in unison.

18:36.018 --> 18:37.103
Okay, yeah.

18:37.128 --> 18:38.552
You look like Rockettes.

18:38.577 --> 18:40.486
"Do a half dozen with each foot..."

18:40.511 --> 18:42.962
"And do a half a dozen
at twice the speed."

18:42.987 --> 18:44.376
- Oh, look at Ming go.
- Yeah.

18:44.392 --> 18:45.658
I gotta say, Ming,
you've got a little bit

18:45.760 --> 18:48.094
- more flair in yours.
- Yeah.

18:48.196 --> 18:49.428
Yeah, do it like...
Ming just do it. Yeah.

18:49.530 --> 18:51.126
Both: There you go.

18:51.151 --> 18:52.868
[laughter]

18:52.967 --> 18:54.500
How does that feel on your glutes?

18:54.525 --> 18:56.720
- They feel tight already.
- I'm a little sore.

18:56.745 --> 18:58.025
[laughter]

18:58.072 --> 18:59.742
Now we're getting to
the partner exercises.

18:59.767 --> 19:00.851
Okay.

19:00.876 --> 19:03.234
"Cap and Falcon's Buddy-Buddy

19:03.259 --> 19:05.033
- "Backward Knee Bends."
- Okay.

19:05.058 --> 19:07.236
"Stand with your backs facing

19:07.275 --> 19:09.214
"with a couple of feet between you.

19:09.239 --> 19:11.039
"Intertwine your arms leaning backward."

19:11.141 --> 19:12.898
I feel bad for this guy. It's
like he's doing with a toddler.

19:12.923 --> 19:15.543
- Okay, wait.
- Wait, I gotta bend down.

19:15.568 --> 19:16.622
- You're a little shorter than me.
- All right, all right,

19:16.647 --> 19:19.658
Okay. "Now go down
into a 'kneep dee' bend

19:19.683 --> 19:21.338
"and remain there for a few seconds..."

19:21.363 --> 19:22.902
- Okay. Okay.
- "Before slowly returning

19:22.927 --> 19:24.519
- to your original position."
- Oh, I'm gonna fall. [grunts]

- [grunting]

19:26.371 --> 19:28.189
- Oh, man.
- There you go.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.392
Oh, man, you're turning
a a weird shade of purple

19:30.494 --> 19:31.660
- right now, brother.
- [laughter]

19:31.762 --> 19:33.528
Are you sure you want to sell this book?

19:33.630 --> 19:35.530
- [laughter]
- I think you might need this.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.582
Yeah, I might need to do
some exercises with it.

19:38.607 --> 19:39.991
[laughter]

19:40.051 --> 19:41.503
<i>Where did you get this book, man?</i>

19:41.605 --> 19:43.405
I mean, I haven't seen one in decades.

19:43.507 --> 19:46.007
I bought a-a short
box of "Hulk" comics,

19:46.109 --> 19:47.909
and this was just thrown in there.

19:48.011 --> 19:50.011
- Look at it, Mike.
- It's absolutely gorgeous.

19:50.113 --> 19:51.428
No yellowing of the pages.

19:51.453 --> 19:53.248
There's a little
upturn here, but I mean,

19:53.273 --> 19:55.807
for something that was printed
in 1976, it's beautiful.

19:55.832 --> 19:56.885
It's something we should
definitely go after, man.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.053
Absolutely.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.220
What are you looking to get for it?

19:59.323 --> 20:01.529
Uh, 65 bucks?

20:01.589 --> 20:03.322
$65, huh?

20:03.347 --> 20:05.756
$65 is probably what we'd ask for it.

20:05.781 --> 20:08.096
So you're coming in kinda
close to retail on...

20:08.198 --> 20:11.066
on this item. Um, I
can give you 30 bucks.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.535
Would you do $45 maybe?

20:13.637 --> 20:16.538
How about $40? I think I could do $40.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.006
And, uh, it would be, uh,

20:18.108 --> 20:20.275
I think that'd be a
fair price for this item.

20:20.377 --> 20:21.647
I'd do $40.

20:21.672 --> 20:23.802
All right. Done deal.

You know, we're getting...
we're getting up there.

20:32.322 --> 20:34.380
I mean, we're... we're
kinda looking a little doughy

20:34.482 --> 20:35.815
and fluffy in the middle.

20:35.917 --> 20:37.083
Maybe... maybe we should stay after work

20:37.185 --> 20:38.384
with the exercise book, you know,

20:38.486 --> 20:39.919
- a couple nights a week.
- I'm in.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.421
I agree, man. I've...
I've been inspired.

20:52.013 --> 20:54.477
the time has gone by in
a flash and we're done.

20:54.502 --> 20:56.169
For "Comic Book Men," I'm Kevin Smith.

20:56.271 --> 20:57.737

- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.
