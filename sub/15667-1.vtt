00:17.556 --> 00:19.224
Excuse me. Are you jewish?

00:19.225 --> 00:21.226
Maybe you want to come inside
and pray, do a mitzvah?

00:21.227 --> 00:24.562
Huh? Sammy. Sammy,
come help the man. Sam.

00:26.165 --> 00:28.833
Happy hanukkah.
You're always welcome.

02:09.967 --> 02:11.202
You're late!

02:11.203 --> 02:13.537
- I know. I know.
- Happy hanukkah to you.

02:13.538 --> 02:14.538
Hmm.

02:14.539 --> 02:16.473
Oh, it's the goylem.

02:16.474 --> 02:17.975
Why didn't you tell me
the horrible goylem was going?

02:17.976 --> 02:19.977
Don't scare me, goylem.

02:19.978 --> 02:21.746
Nothing works in this house.

02:21.747 --> 02:22.747
I know.

02:22.748 --> 02:24.749
I heard you.

02:24.750 --> 02:27.085
Here you go, kvetcher.
Stop kvetching.

02:27.086 --> 02:29.254
Stop kvetching.

02:29.255 --> 02:31.556
Oy!

02:31.557 --> 02:33.525
Move up.

02:33.526 --> 02:36.761
You're one heavy monster,
you goylem.

02:36.762 --> 02:38.096
How's my latkes?

02:38.097 --> 02:40.331
Oh, not so good, unless
you like your food cold.

02:40.332 --> 02:41.999
I need you in the den.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.101
Sure, sure.

02:43.102 --> 02:44.435
Hold on. Hold on.

02:44.436 --> 02:46.437
Mendeleh, it's important.

02:46.438 --> 02:47.639
More important than hanukkah?

02:47.640 --> 02:50.141
All right, all right.

02:50.142 --> 02:51.776
Look what your mameleh
is doing to me.

02:51.777 --> 02:54.112
Tateh, I'll tell you when
the first latke is ready.

02:54.113 --> 02:55.580
Ahh.

02:55.581 --> 02:57.014
That's my bubeleh.

02:57.015 --> 02:58.916
Don't forget, you've got a
lesson with the rebbe tomorrow.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.351
Don't be strict with that.
Two more pages!

03:00.352 --> 03:01.519
Tateh, I know.

03:01.520 --> 03:02.753
Do you want a taste?

03:02.754 --> 03:05.756
I want to meet her.
Please? Just an introduction.

03:05.757 --> 03:07.425
You know you're not allowed
to talk to her yet.

03:07.426 --> 03:09.760
I want to know what she's like.

03:09.761 --> 03:14.432
I have to turn on the lights.
Do your chores.

03:27.612 --> 03:30.949
Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

03:36.321 --> 03:37.655
Ruth, watch your brother.
I will, mama.

03:37.656 --> 03:39.090
Thank you.

03:39.091 --> 03:43.528
Yes. Shmuel.

03:43.529 --> 03:46.497
Don't be intimidated by her.

03:46.498 --> 03:48.165
The lazars are a family.

03:48.166 --> 03:50.969
Maybe they have a few more
dollars than we have.

03:50.970 --> 03:53.571
Maybe they have
a stove that actually works.

03:53.572 --> 03:58.243
They're just a family,
like us, all right?

04:04.950 --> 04:08.619
I see the two children
were playing?

04:11.123 --> 04:12.791
Maybe too much sugar?

04:12.792 --> 04:16.795
Take yankel.
He has to wash his hands.

04:16.796 --> 04:17.796
<i>Zei gezunt.</i>

04:17.797 --> 04:19.497
Go take a walk.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.235
Hi. Happy hanukkah.
I got you a present.

04:26.738 --> 04:29.573
Oh, I'm not so sure!

04:30.909 --> 04:32.010
<i>Lehayim. Lehayim.</i>

04:32.011 --> 04:34.012
You're gonna be
a good rabbi, shmuel.

04:34.013 --> 04:36.347
- One more time.
- Let's try it. Let's see.

04:36.348 --> 04:38.182
Maybe I should continue
to work with you.

04:38.183 --> 04:39.417
Nah. We talked about it.

04:39.418 --> 04:40.918
<i>I could make more gelt
with you.</i>

04:40.919 --> 04:41.919
That's a good idea.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.587
Why? Why is it
such a good idea?

04:43.588 --> 04:45.256
Why? What have I taught you,
shmuel?

04:45.257 --> 04:46.924
He... the man
who immerses himself.

04:46.925 --> 04:49.027
In a desire
for money is always...

04:49.028 --> 04:51.095
Remember that, always...
in debt.

04:51.096 --> 04:52.430
I don't understand
why it's such a bad thing.

04:52.431 --> 04:53.564
<i>To make a little gelt.</i>

04:53.565 --> 04:55.233
Yeah, I don't want to
marry a poor man.

04:55.234 --> 04:56.901
Ah, bubeleh, you'll be lucky.

04:56.902 --> 04:59.003
If any man marries you
with that pisk.

04:59.004 --> 05:00.671
Mendel! Well, she... she...

05:00.672 --> 05:02.507
<i>She has a lot of chutzpah
to talk... okay.</i>

05:02.508 --> 05:04.208
Pass the latkes. Okay.

05:10.816 --> 05:13.985
Every single piece
of fabric that I own.

05:13.986 --> 05:15.653
Comes from this store. I know that.
That's why I'm not profiting on this deal.

05:15.654 --> 05:17.154
Look, ma'am, your daughter
will have a beautiful dress.

05:17.155 --> 05:18.990
Made from the finest silk
in thailand, all right?

05:18.991 --> 05:20.725
You know, I don't even
want to deal with you.

05:20.726 --> 05:22.026
Where's mendel?

05:22.027 --> 05:23.528
Mendel... mendel's not here
right now. I'm sorry.

05:23.529 --> 05:24.862
He's not here? Mendel!
Go to another store on this block.

05:24.863 --> 05:26.697
They deal in cheap, shoddy material.
Mendel!

05:26.698 --> 05:28.533
Look who's here!
Okay, thank you.

05:28.534 --> 05:29.867
<i>Mazel tov. Mazel tov, mendel.</i>

05:29.868 --> 05:33.203
The big girl is turning... what?
Señorita's 15, 16?

05:33.204 --> 05:34.204
15. 15.

05:34.205 --> 05:35.372
Thank you for remembering.

05:35.373 --> 05:36.707
Now, can you help me out here?

05:36.708 --> 05:38.375
<i>¿Qué pasó? ¿Qué pasó?
Nothing pasó.</i>

05:38.376 --> 05:39.577
Look, ma'am, all right,

05:39.578 --> 05:42.413
I'll do 75% silk,
25% rayon for $19 a yard.

05:42.414 --> 05:44.081
I'm sorry. That's it.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.751
Just... just go get it.

05:46.752 --> 05:48.085
Go get it.

05:48.086 --> 05:50.821
Yeah. Go get it.

05:54.226 --> 05:57.562
I hope you'll treat your wife
better than this box.

05:57.563 --> 06:00.965
You let her off too easy,
tateh.

06:00.966 --> 06:01.966
She has money.

06:01.967 --> 06:03.601
She's loyal.

06:03.602 --> 06:06.170
Eh, it's... it's worth
a couple of nickels.

06:06.171 --> 06:07.605
What have I taught you?

06:07.606 --> 06:11.075
Be nice, charge little...
you'll get a lot of customers.

06:11.076 --> 06:12.576
You think gloria's at home
singing about how great you are?

06:12.577 --> 06:13.677
You need to draw a line
somewhere.

06:13.678 --> 06:15.012
Your customers are gonna
walk all over you.

06:15.013 --> 06:16.780
Shmuel gold. What?

06:16.781 --> 06:18.215
This is my store,
and I run it my way.

06:18.216 --> 06:19.584
When you become a rabbi,

06:19.585 --> 06:22.319
I'm not gonna shove my nose
in your business, all right?

06:22.320 --> 06:24.321
Did you get your allowance?

06:24.322 --> 06:26.190
Yeah, mama gave it to me.

06:29.260 --> 06:30.027
Here.

06:30.028 --> 06:31.596
Take it, take it,
take it, take it.

06:31.597 --> 06:34.432
It's a little something extra
between me and you.

06:34.433 --> 06:36.501
<i>Shaynem dank, tateh.</i>

06:50.382 --> 06:54.385
<i>That means you can go
and get your lovers.</i>

06:54.386 --> 06:58.556
<i>Go ahead. Get your lovers.
I'll wait.</i>

06:58.557 --> 07:03.060
<i>If you all
are just tuning in...</i>

07:03.061 --> 07:06.196
Get out of here. Hey.

07:06.197 --> 07:08.832
Get out of here!

07:10.936 --> 07:14.271
Mama, ruth left the bathroom
window open again.

07:14.272 --> 07:15.773
<i>It's freezing. Stop utzing me.</i>

07:15.774 --> 07:17.742
You were supposed to
take the garbage out.

07:17.743 --> 07:18.676
It's shabbos.

07:18.677 --> 07:19.977
And it smells!

07:19.978 --> 07:21.946
Don't let anyone see you,
especially your father!

07:31.389 --> 07:35.492
Huh? Where you going? Thank god
your father's not here to see this.

07:38.563 --> 07:41.565
Don't worry so much, ma!

07:41.566 --> 07:42.566
Wait.

07:42.567 --> 07:43.734
<i>Gut shabbos.</i>

07:43.735 --> 07:47.738
And merry hanukkah to you, too!

07:47.739 --> 07:50.741
There's my samelah.

07:50.742 --> 07:53.911
Did you see the tits
on that girl on tv?

07:53.912 --> 07:55.079
Maybe.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.248
Maybe?

07:57.249 --> 07:58.649
You know they're fake, right?

07:58.650 --> 08:00.151
What do you mean?

08:00.152 --> 08:01.519
Well, sometimes...

08:01.520 --> 08:05.022
What are you doing?
You're smoking on shabbos now?

08:05.023 --> 08:07.859
Yeah, put that out.
It's shabbos.

08:07.860 --> 08:09.693
<i>Dank. You think
he listens to me? Please.</i>

08:09.694 --> 08:11.095
Get it from both sides.

08:11.096 --> 08:13.898
"You think he listens to me?
You think he listens to me?"

08:13.899 --> 08:17.235
No doubt I listen
to my man sammy.

08:17.236 --> 08:20.338
The soon-to-be-married
sammy gold.

08:20.339 --> 08:22.340
<i>Mazel tov. We're gonna be late
for shul. Let's go.</i>

08:22.341 --> 08:25.343
<i>Mazel. Mazel, sammy.</i>

08:25.344 --> 08:27.678
What's her name, huh, sammy?

08:27.679 --> 08:30.715
Vanna? Huh? Vanna white?

08:30.716 --> 08:31.549
No.

08:31.550 --> 08:32.783
You ever see that show?

08:32.784 --> 08:35.619
I made sure he didn't,
thank you very much.

08:35.620 --> 08:38.222
The best show ever! You got to watch it!
It's the greatest!

08:38.222 --> 08:40.524
<i>Ay, shaineh maidel.
Don't stare. Don't stare.</i>

08:40.525 --> 08:41.692
You're the one staring.
I'm not staring.

08:41.693 --> 08:43.193
Hey, sammy, let me ask you...

08:43.195 --> 08:44.695
Do you even know what to do
with a beautiful girl?

08:44.696 --> 08:47.031
<i>The rebbe will tell me.
Gut shabbos. Goodbye.</i>

08:47.032 --> 08:48.032
The rebbe will tell you? Yes.

08:48.033 --> 08:49.333
What's the rebbe
gonna tell you?

08:49.334 --> 08:51.468
The rebbe's not gonna tell you
how to please your wife.

08:51.469 --> 08:52.970
Would you stop it?
Don't listen to him.

08:52.971 --> 08:54.638
He's fine. He's jealous.

08:54.639 --> 08:56.274
What am I jealous of,
leon, huh?

08:56.275 --> 08:58.809
Jealous of marrying a girl
I don't even know?

08:58.810 --> 09:00.778
My tateh says it's time
for us to get married.

09:00.779 --> 09:02.346
<i>We will be happy.
Baruch hashem.</i>

09:02.347 --> 09:03.714
Goodbye. Thank you.

09:03.715 --> 09:08.118
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah,
baruch hashem. Very confident.</i>

09:08.119 --> 09:10.688
Mr. Lazar! Hey, mr. Lazar!

09:11.623 --> 09:13.857
Get off of me! Get off of me!

09:13.858 --> 09:16.026
Come on, get off of me,
you fucking fag.

09:16.027 --> 09:18.996
Get off. Get out of here.
Run to shul, little girls.

09:18.997 --> 09:20.664
Go home!

09:20.665 --> 09:25.469
They heard hashem's voice
moving in the garden.

09:25.470 --> 09:27.738
With the wind of day.

09:27.739 --> 09:32.743
The man and his wife
hid themselves from hashem.

09:32.744 --> 09:36.146
Among the trees of the garden.

09:36.147 --> 09:39.650
Hashem called to the man,

09:39.651 --> 09:43.654
And he said, "where are you?"

09:43.655 --> 09:48.826
Did hashem know
where adam was hiding?

09:48.827 --> 09:49.860
Shmuel?

09:51.797 --> 09:53.597
Shmuel?

09:53.598 --> 09:58.935
God being god
knew where adam was hiding,

09:58.936 --> 10:03.607
But the question
is for adam to answer.

10:03.608 --> 10:07.278
All men must answer this.

10:07.279 --> 10:10.614
They must know where they stand.

10:10.615 --> 10:14.951
In relation
to hashem's presence.

10:14.952 --> 10:19.156
Either you move closer...

10:19.157 --> 10:22.893
Or further away.

10:29.867 --> 10:32.402
Your friend is very wise
with the talmud.

10:32.403 --> 10:35.072
He could be a good rabbi.

10:35.073 --> 10:37.574
But we're not here
to talk about leon.

10:37.575 --> 10:39.743
We're here to talk about you.

10:39.744 --> 10:42.079
I think I'd prefer
to work with my father.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.580
I see.

10:43.581 --> 10:46.751
Judaism is about community.

10:46.752 --> 10:48.886
It's about looking outward
to others,

10:48.887 --> 10:50.888
Not just looking inward
at yourself.

10:50.889 --> 10:52.189
<i>Farshteyn. Farshteyn.</i>

10:52.190 --> 10:54.925
I don't want to be a burden
to my family or the community.

10:54.926 --> 10:57.762
Very well. Very well.

10:57.763 --> 11:01.665
<i>I have given my blessing
for the first bashert.</i>

11:01.666 --> 11:03.834
You have?

11:03.835 --> 11:07.004
I pray the meeting
goes in your favor.

11:07.005 --> 11:11.008
You'll be a husband and a father
before you know it.

11:11.009 --> 11:13.010
<i>Thank you, rebbe.
A shaynem dank.</i>

11:13.011 --> 11:16.847
Only then
will you find true joy.

11:16.848 --> 11:22.286
And all this will become clear.

11:32.497 --> 11:35.332
Will you study at the koel?

11:35.333 --> 11:40.004
Yes, well,
I-I work in manhattan now.

11:40.005 --> 11:43.374
I'm not sure about
becoming a rabbi yet.

11:43.375 --> 11:46.277
You like
playing basketball more?

11:46.278 --> 11:49.546
You've seen me? No, no.

11:49.547 --> 11:51.048
No.

11:51.049 --> 11:53.884
No. My tateh
will talk to the rabbi.

11:53.885 --> 11:56.287
They will decide for me.

11:56.288 --> 11:57.455
What job do you do?

11:57.456 --> 12:00.057
I take care of my younger
brothers and sisters.

12:00.058 --> 12:01.525
Oh. That's nice.

12:01.526 --> 12:02.826
How many children?

12:04.161 --> 12:05.161
Five?

12:05.162 --> 12:06.830
No, I want eight.

12:06.831 --> 12:08.265
Eight?

12:08.266 --> 12:09.132
<i>Baruch hashem.</i>

12:09.133 --> 12:12.035
<i>Baruch hashem.</i>

12:12.036 --> 12:14.705
<i>Which yeshiva
would they attend?</i>

12:14.706 --> 12:17.375
Eight? Wow.

12:28.620 --> 12:32.623
Sammy. Come over here
for a second.

12:34.926 --> 12:36.526
It's freezing out, huh?

12:36.527 --> 12:39.430
Yeah.

12:39.431 --> 12:42.766
I'm sorry I gave you shit about
your marriage the other day.

12:42.767 --> 12:44.601
That's okay.
I'm not even married yet.

12:44.602 --> 12:46.102
Yeah.

12:46.103 --> 12:48.104
So, where are you
gonna live, huh?

12:48.105 --> 12:50.073
You gonna live
with your parents?

12:50.074 --> 12:51.608
<i>Mazel, is that a rolex?</i>

12:51.609 --> 12:52.776
Shh, shh!

12:52.777 --> 12:54.778
<i>Leon's a fucking mensch.
You know that.</i>

12:56.548 --> 12:57.948
Working for
the medical business now.

12:57.949 --> 13:00.283
For a doctor?

13:00.284 --> 13:02.018
Yeah, sort of.

13:02.019 --> 13:04.254
You know, uh...

13:04.255 --> 13:06.657
What?

13:06.658 --> 13:07.924
You know, I-I think they, uh...

13:07.925 --> 13:10.194
I think they need another guy,
if you're interested.

13:10.195 --> 13:12.596
If you're looking for some
extra work, it's a good job.

13:12.597 --> 13:13.998
Really? Yeah.

13:13.999 --> 13:16.533
Easiest money you'll ever make.

13:16.534 --> 13:18.835
All-expenses trip to europe...

13:18.836 --> 13:21.305
I mean, you fly anywhere,
really.

13:21.306 --> 13:23.773
Girls, fast cars,
see the world.

13:23.774 --> 13:25.775
I have a job, thank you.

13:25.776 --> 13:29.279
Yeah, I know. I know.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.582
Let me ask you a question.

13:31.583 --> 13:35.119
Who do you think pays the bills
in my house?

13:35.120 --> 13:37.287
'Cause leon doesn't pay
the fucking bills,

13:37.288 --> 13:38.622
I'll tell you that.

13:38.623 --> 13:43.127
I mean, you got groceries,
electric bill, mortgage.

13:43.128 --> 13:45.962
My fucking mother
doesn't pay the mortgage.

13:45.963 --> 13:46.963
You do?

13:46.964 --> 13:48.632
I do.

13:48.633 --> 13:50.800
What happens
when you and young vanna.

13:50.801 --> 13:53.003
<i>Want to have a few kinder
of your own?</i>

13:53.004 --> 13:55.672
I work with my father, yosef.

13:57.708 --> 13:59.376
Yeah.

14:01.812 --> 14:04.648
Women like shiny things.

14:06.651 --> 14:10.154
You know what time it is?
It's fake titty time.

14:11.656 --> 14:13.490
Think about it, all right?

14:13.491 --> 14:16.893
Page me later.
Come on. I'll race you.

14:16.894 --> 14:19.563
Come on.

14:30.808 --> 14:32.509
So, tell me what happened.

14:32.510 --> 14:34.211
Well,
she was more nervous than me.

14:34.212 --> 14:35.546
Did her parents
say anything yet, or...?

14:35.547 --> 14:37.180
No, not yet. No?

14:37.181 --> 14:38.849
Oh, oh, what were you and yose
talking about before?

14:38.850 --> 14:42.185
Nothing, nothing.
His new business.

14:42.186 --> 14:44.121
Yose doesn't have a business.

14:44.122 --> 14:45.522
Well, he offered me a job.

14:45.523 --> 14:47.524
<i>Are you meshugga?
You work for yosef?</i>

14:47.525 --> 14:50.427
Yeah, he offered me $1,000
to import medicine from europe.

14:50.428 --> 14:52.596
Maybe I should do it for zeldy.

14:52.597 --> 14:53.763
That doesn't make sense.

14:53.764 --> 14:55.432
<i>There's no medicine work
that type of gelt.</i>

14:55.433 --> 14:57.434
No, no, it's special.
It's... it's for rich people.

14:57.435 --> 15:00.604
But, listen, I won't go
unless you go with me.

15:00.605 --> 15:03.307
Why didn't he ask me?
I've never been to europe.

15:03.308 --> 15:05.775
That's where
our grandparents came from.

15:08.312 --> 15:11.148
Oh, I got it, mama. I got it.

15:11.149 --> 15:12.315
No, no.

15:12.316 --> 15:14.985
No, no. Hey. Stop, stop, stop.

15:14.986 --> 15:16.820
Don't hurt yourself.
All right, here.

15:16.821 --> 15:19.990
Go tell your tateh that yankel
should be in bed already.

15:19.991 --> 15:23.326
One second. There we go.

15:23.327 --> 15:24.828
What's wrong?

15:24.829 --> 15:25.829
Nothing.

15:25.830 --> 15:27.831
Mama, something's wrong.
Tell me.

15:27.832 --> 15:29.432
Nothing. It's the stove.

15:29.433 --> 15:31.235
Mama.

15:31.236 --> 15:34.437
Go get your father.

15:34.438 --> 15:36.774
What's the matter?

15:39.010 --> 15:42.679
Just... he made me a promise.

15:44.148 --> 15:47.851
The lazars have started
to look for another marriage.

15:47.852 --> 15:50.353
<i>I'm sorry, my boychik.</i>

15:54.025 --> 15:56.527
And the old lady said...

15:56.528 --> 15:59.729
"thank
you for not stealing the apples!

15:59.730 --> 16:00.931
Thank you for asking!"

16:00.932 --> 16:04.134
And she gave him
a whole basket.

16:04.135 --> 16:06.970
Now, the tired traveler...
and he wasn't just a traveler.

16:06.971 --> 16:09.640
Remember, he was a rabbi.
He was famous.

16:09.641 --> 16:11.375
He was a miracle maker.

16:11.376 --> 16:12.643
Have you heard any news?

16:12.644 --> 16:14.978
Shh. He said to the...
to the lady... he said...

16:14.979 --> 16:18.482
Tateh... Why won't
they let her marry me?

16:18.483 --> 16:20.317
Is it because of our family?

16:25.990 --> 16:30.160
Just... just keep on studying,
okay?

16:30.161 --> 16:32.663
Just keep on studying.
Don't worry.

16:32.664 --> 16:36.500
Focus on your studies.
We'll find you a good bride.

16:36.501 --> 16:37.934
Okay. All right?

16:37.935 --> 16:40.537
Come. Pray with your brother
and me.

16:40.538 --> 16:42.873
Uh, no.

16:42.874 --> 16:46.609
No. I have a cold.
I don't want him to catch it.

16:59.857 --> 17:01.524
<i>Fuck! What the fuck
is he doing here?!</i>

17:01.525 --> 17:02.859
No, he comes with me.

17:02.860 --> 17:04.161
What the fuck
is he doing here?!

17:04.162 --> 17:05.494
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

17:05.496 --> 17:06.596
Don't tell me what to do.

17:06.597 --> 17:08.031
Yosef, if he doesn't go,
I don't go.

17:08.031 --> 17:09.299
I told you not to tell anybody.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.233
Go home, leon.
Trust me... go home.

17:11.234 --> 17:13.502
Do you want me to tell mommy?
Go home!

17:13.503 --> 17:14.503
Stop it!

17:14.505 --> 17:15.972
He comes with me, yosef.

17:15.973 --> 17:18.141
<i>What the fuck are you looking
at, you fucking shvartzes?</i>

17:18.142 --> 17:19.810
Turn around, fool.

17:19.810 --> 17:22.478
All right.

17:22.479 --> 17:25.481
All right.
All right, all right.

17:25.482 --> 17:27.483
All right.

17:27.483 --> 17:29.319
Okay. Relax. Let's go.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.822
Okay?

17:31.823 --> 17:33.623
Fuck!

17:37.528 --> 17:40.697
He's a nice guy, right?

17:40.698 --> 17:43.466
Are you kidding me?
He's the best.

17:43.467 --> 17:44.467
We can trust him?

17:44.468 --> 17:46.136
Of course. He's jewish.

17:46.137 --> 17:49.806
All right. Wait here.

17:52.143 --> 17:54.477
Don't touch anything.

17:58.349 --> 17:59.683
He looks nervous.

17:59.684 --> 18:03.186
Maybe he doesn't like doctors.

18:03.187 --> 18:08.157
Jackie?
Is jackie in his office?

18:08.158 --> 18:09.960
Oh, my god.

18:09.961 --> 18:12.328
Oh, my god. I love your hats.

18:12.329 --> 18:13.329
Thank you.

18:13.330 --> 18:14.998
They're so amazing.

18:14.999 --> 18:16.099
I... oh.

18:16.100 --> 18:18.635
No, no, no, no, no.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

18:18.636 --> 18:21.137
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
You're not supposed to touch it.

18:24.475 --> 18:26.243
Slut.

18:26.244 --> 18:29.379
Jackie? Hi.

18:33.718 --> 18:36.053
Ugh. Not good.
It's disgusting. Ugh.

18:36.054 --> 18:38.722
Right.

18:43.895 --> 18:47.064
This is the guy
I was telling you about.

18:47.065 --> 18:49.499
My brother and sammy gold.

18:54.004 --> 18:55.839
Okay.

19:00.344 --> 19:02.846
He loved you. He loved you.

19:02.847 --> 19:04.681
He loved you!

19:04.682 --> 19:05.982
- Elka!
- One second!

19:05.983 --> 19:07.250
Who was it who called for you?

19:07.251 --> 19:09.086
The rebbe personally
from atlantic city.

19:09.087 --> 19:11.254
- Suggested that we go.
- This is for you.

19:11.255 --> 19:12.956
It might be hard
to find glatt kosher.

19:12.957 --> 19:14.491
<i>Shaynem dank. Thank you.</i>

19:14.492 --> 19:16.493
Thank you, mama.

19:16.494 --> 19:18.095
Well, what more can I say?

19:18.096 --> 19:20.563
I mean, the fact that
the atlantic city rebbe.

19:20.564 --> 19:23.533
Asked for you in person...
that's... that's a big honor.

19:23.534 --> 19:25.201
I'm so proud of you boys.
Big honor.

19:25.202 --> 19:26.836
Your father
would be very proud.

19:26.837 --> 19:28.539
You have everything?

19:28.540 --> 19:31.642
Well, go, go.

19:35.480 --> 19:39.149
<i>May I have your attention,
please?</i>

19:39.150 --> 19:42.819
Hi. Uh, that's my seat.

19:42.820 --> 19:45.322
Excuse me.

19:51.996 --> 19:54.998
<i>And as soon as we reach
our cruising altitude,</i>

19:54.999 --> 20:00.103
<i>A cold meal and a variety
of drinks will be served.</i>

20:00.104 --> 20:02.172
We'll fall asleep right away.

20:02.173 --> 20:04.241
You enjoy the flight?
It was okay.

20:04.242 --> 20:06.442
Listen to me very closely,
okay, boys?

20:06.443 --> 20:07.810
I have two things for you.

20:07.811 --> 20:10.180
One is an envelope with cash
and your itinerary in it.

20:10.181 --> 20:11.648
The other is a piece of paper.

20:11.649 --> 20:12.916
When you get off the jetway,

20:12.917 --> 20:15.085
I want you to follow signs
that say "taxi," okay?

20:15.086 --> 20:17.320
Get in line, get into the taxi,
give them the piece of paper.

20:17.321 --> 20:19.256
You're gonna go to the hotel,
you're gonna check in,

20:19.257 --> 20:21.058
And you're gonna wait for me
to call, all right?

20:21.059 --> 20:22.059
Okay. Good.

20:22.060 --> 20:23.093
Where are you going?

20:23.094 --> 20:24.594
I'll be back.
I'll call you later.

20:24.595 --> 20:25.762
Yose.

20:51.956 --> 20:54.624
<i>This is mokem.</i>

20:56.794 --> 20:59.462
It's no safe haven.

21:06.470 --> 21:08.071
What? Let me see yours.

21:08.072 --> 21:10.106
You look like
you're 10 years old here.

21:10.107 --> 21:11.708
This looks nothing like you.

21:11.709 --> 21:13.710
Yes, it does.
You look like you're 10.

21:21.419 --> 21:25.088
Should we page your brother?

21:25.089 --> 21:27.925
He said he'd call.

22:11.836 --> 22:16.139
- Come on, boys!
- It's your uncle yosef!

22:18.009 --> 22:20.410
Come on.
We're gonna miss your flight.

22:24.315 --> 22:25.482
<i>Oy vey.</i>

22:25.483 --> 22:26.950
This is a waste of time.

22:26.951 --> 22:28.318
Hello, hello.

22:28.319 --> 22:30.153
Hello. You all right?

22:30.154 --> 22:31.488
Yeah. Good.

22:31.489 --> 22:33.723
Listen, we'll see more
of amsterdam next trip, okay?

22:33.724 --> 22:35.158
Let's go over
what I talked about.

22:35.159 --> 22:36.660
I know. You told us already.

22:36.661 --> 22:38.161
You'll be waiting
in terminal 9 parking lot.

22:38.162 --> 22:39.329
With your friend, the goy.

22:39.330 --> 22:40.830
Good, good.
And you travel alone.

22:40.831 --> 22:42.832
You do not know me, and you
do not know each other.

22:42.833 --> 22:44.067
What?

22:44.068 --> 22:45.402
What do you mean?
Why don't we know each other?

22:45.403 --> 22:47.437
You just don't know each other.
It's that simple.

22:47.438 --> 22:49.406
The most important thing
to remember, though...

22:49.407 --> 22:51.841
Do not open your bag
for anybody.

22:51.842 --> 22:53.543
Because of the medicine?

22:53.544 --> 22:55.345
Right, leo,
because of the medicine.

22:55.346 --> 22:57.447
Yeah. What's wrong
with the medicine, yosef?

22:57.448 --> 23:00.116
There's nothing wrong
with the medicine, okay?

23:00.117 --> 23:02.185
What's medicine here might not
mean "medicine" there.

23:02.186 --> 23:04.287
What's medicine there might not
mean "medicine" here.

23:04.288 --> 23:05.655
<i>Farshteyn?</i>

23:05.656 --> 23:07.324
<i>No, not farshteyn.
What's wrong with the medicine?</i>

23:07.325 --> 23:09.559
Yose, yose,
could we get in trouble?

23:12.530 --> 23:14.698
Guys, guys, calm down.

23:18.503 --> 23:24.241
Don't worry so much.
Just think of it as a game.

23:30.514 --> 23:32.415
No one is getting in trouble,

23:32.416 --> 23:34.684
And no one
is gonna suspect a thing.

23:34.685 --> 23:36.686
I promise.

23:57.475 --> 24:01.278
And the medicine is untraceable.
It's like aspirin.

24:01.279 --> 24:03.446
The customs agent
isn't looking for you,

24:03.447 --> 24:05.648
And they're not looking
for the medicine.

24:12.123 --> 24:14.958
Now, they may ask you
some simple questions,

24:14.959 --> 24:16.926
And you reply
with simple answers.

24:16.927 --> 24:20.130
Brussels to montreal
to get here?

24:20.131 --> 24:21.464
Family business.

24:21.465 --> 24:24.634
The most important thing
is this...

24:24.635 --> 24:30.039
Relax, mind your business,
and act jewish.

24:30.040 --> 24:31.307
Load the bag, please.

24:31.308 --> 24:34.144
You load the fucking bags.
They did all the work.

24:34.145 --> 24:35.812
Have a little respect
for my little brother.

24:35.813 --> 24:37.013
Your brother?

24:37.014 --> 24:39.015
You get your brother to smuggle
drugs? That's great.

24:39.016 --> 24:40.316
Drugs? Drugs?

24:40.317 --> 24:42.185
What... what dru...
what are you talking about?

24:42.186 --> 24:44.687
Yose, what drugs?! I knew it.

24:44.688 --> 24:46.689
I knew it. Drugs?
You said, "medicine."

24:46.690 --> 24:48.357
In the car, in the car.

24:48.358 --> 24:51.027
All right, come on.
Shut the fuck up.

24:51.028 --> 24:54.030
Get in the fucking van.
Get in the fucking van.

24:54.031 --> 24:55.031
Get off... ow!

24:55.032 --> 24:58.367
No, no, don't touch my jacket.

24:58.368 --> 25:01.204
I never heard jews complain
so much about making money.

25:01.205 --> 25:03.706
Jesus christ.

25:03.707 --> 25:07.143
Fucking idiot. Fuck.

25:17.688 --> 25:19.456
You know,
jews have been smuggling.

25:19.457 --> 25:22.025
For thousands of years.

25:22.026 --> 25:23.993
Talk to the rebbe.
It will be fine.

25:23.994 --> 25:26.196
What did you say?

25:26.197 --> 25:27.631
Whoa!

25:27.632 --> 25:28.731
Listen to me. Yosef.

25:28.732 --> 25:30.566
I get in trouble,
you get in trouble.

25:30.567 --> 25:32.502
If I don't get in trouble, nobody
gets in trouble, okay? Yosef!

25:32.503 --> 25:34.571
All right, leon? All right?

25:34.572 --> 25:36.205
Get off me, sam!

25:36.206 --> 25:38.542
All right? Who's gonna...
who you gonna tell?

25:38.543 --> 25:40.343
Huh? Who you gonna tell?

25:40.344 --> 25:42.011
Nobody! Nobody!

25:42.012 --> 25:45.315
Come on. Nobody. That's right.

25:49.019 --> 25:51.988
Get the fuck out already.

25:51.989 --> 25:53.556
Sammy, let's go.

25:53.557 --> 25:54.724
- Sam, come on.
- Okay.

25:54.725 --> 25:57.360
Sammy, hold on. Hold on.

25:58.529 --> 26:00.630
I told you not to tell
my little brother.

26:00.631 --> 26:03.233
You did a good job, though.

26:05.569 --> 26:07.570
You did a really good job.

26:11.842 --> 26:15.178
If you want to come out with us,
page me later, all right?

26:16.513 --> 26:18.348
Page me later!

26:20.017 --> 26:22.852
What are you looking at,
you fucking polack?

26:44.942 --> 26:46.442
Sorry I got you into this.

26:46.443 --> 26:48.945
You didn't get me into anything.
We didn't know.

26:48.946 --> 26:51.114
Just... Give
the money back, okay?

26:51.115 --> 26:53.449
Yeah, I will, I will, I will.

26:53.450 --> 26:56.452
Okay. I won't tell anyone.
I promise.

26:56.453 --> 26:58.621
I- I'm ashamed.

26:58.622 --> 27:00.456
Well, we didn't know, leon.
It just happened.

27:00.457 --> 27:02.458
We didn't know.
We didn't know. Yeah.

27:02.459 --> 27:05.128
<i>We should have!</i>

27:08.232 --> 27:11.067
We didn't know, leon.

27:54.212 --> 27:55.811
- Look at leon.
- He's such a good...

27:55.812 --> 27:58.648
Oh, fuck leon.

28:03.487 --> 28:05.989
Try to help
the ones you love, right?

28:05.990 --> 28:08.825
You tell the old man
about the cash?

28:08.826 --> 28:11.828
They don't exactly know yet,
but thank you.

28:11.829 --> 28:13.162
That's a good thing.

28:13.163 --> 28:14.831
Yeah.

28:14.832 --> 28:15.998
Hey, yosef.

28:15.999 --> 28:18.000
Leon's not talking to me.

28:18.001 --> 28:19.001
He's not?

28:19.002 --> 28:21.671
Yeah, I'm heartbroken.

28:21.672 --> 28:23.340
You know, I think I'm getting
out of here for a while.

28:23.341 --> 28:26.175
I'm gonna go over to jackie's.
You should come.

28:26.176 --> 28:29.178
I told him how good of a job
you did.

28:29.179 --> 28:30.347
He wants to meet you.

28:30.348 --> 28:32.349
He wants to meet me?

28:32.350 --> 28:37.019
Yeah. So,
consider yourself invited.

28:37.020 --> 28:39.689
Hey, yosef? Tell me the truth
about the pills.

28:39.690 --> 28:42.359
I won't tell anybody.
I promise.

28:45.863 --> 28:47.196
They're harmless.

28:47.197 --> 28:49.031
Yeah?

28:49.032 --> 28:52.034
I promise. Okay.

28:52.035 --> 28:54.704
You know where to find me.

28:59.310 --> 29:03.212
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I think I ordered a brunette.

29:03.213 --> 29:04.848
Oh, that's funny.

29:04.849 --> 29:06.382
I didn't think
I ordered a hasid.

29:06.383 --> 29:08.384
Do you want to go back
to where you came from?

29:08.385 --> 29:09.585
Fuck you.

29:09.586 --> 29:13.489
Hi. Jackie.

29:13.490 --> 29:15.658
All right.
Rachel, this is sammy.

29:15.659 --> 29:17.493
Sammy, this is rachel.
Rachel. Nice to meet you.

29:17.494 --> 29:19.328
Oh, no, thank you. No offense.

29:19.329 --> 29:20.830
It's out of respect for you.

29:20.831 --> 29:23.132
I have no respect for you.
Here. Take my jacket.

29:23.133 --> 29:25.301
Oh, fuck you. Welcome.
Please make yourself at home.

29:25.302 --> 29:28.805
Yosef, I think
I've actually met her before.

29:28.806 --> 29:30.973
Yeah, maybe in your wet dreams.

29:30.974 --> 29:33.642
You remember andrew.
That's tabitha.

29:33.643 --> 29:36.212
She's the hottest model
in France.

29:36.213 --> 29:37.346
Say hi, tabitha.

29:40.550 --> 29:43.252
That was a long "hi."

29:43.253 --> 29:44.386
Uh, what else do we got?

29:44.387 --> 29:46.823
I have no idea who
the fuck these people are,

29:46.824 --> 29:47.990
But they're a lot of cool jews,

29:47.991 --> 29:49.092
So it's a good thing for us.

29:49.093 --> 29:51.428
Jackie, you got company!

29:51.429 --> 29:54.564
A lot of cool jews here,
sammy... a lot of cool jews.

29:54.565 --> 29:56.900
One goy... forget about him.
God does.

29:56.901 --> 29:58.434
Yosef!

29:58.435 --> 30:01.470
Come here. By yourself.

30:01.471 --> 30:02.471
All right.

30:02.472 --> 30:03.973
Yosef.

30:15.519 --> 30:16.652
Hi.

30:18.488 --> 30:20.356
Hi.

30:20.357 --> 30:22.759
Looks like you could
use a friend.

30:22.760 --> 30:23.927
Do you want a drink?

30:23.928 --> 30:25.661
Uh, no, thank you.

30:25.662 --> 30:27.831
Loosen up a little.
How old are you?

30:27.832 --> 30:29.833
Um, 20 years.

30:29.834 --> 30:32.001
<i>20 years?</i>

30:32.002 --> 30:34.437
Is that, like,
opposed to days and months?

30:34.438 --> 30:36.939
- Excuse me.
- It's my age.

30:36.940 --> 30:38.808
Jackie is a really lucky guy.

30:38.809 --> 30:41.644
Thank you.

30:41.645 --> 30:44.947
Is there anything I can get
you here or somewhere else?

30:44.948 --> 30:47.850
You look so wound up.
I just want you to relax.

30:47.851 --> 30:49.552
I'm relaxed. I'm fine.
Thank you.

30:49.553 --> 30:51.554
Why don't you taste this?
It's delicious.

30:51.555 --> 30:52.555
He's had it forever.

30:52.556 --> 30:53.723
Thank you. I'm not tasting it.

30:53.724 --> 30:56.659
It's really good.
It's better aged.

30:56.660 --> 30:58.461
You want to take
your jacket off?

30:58.462 --> 31:00.563
'Cause they're gonna be
a while, so...

31:00.564 --> 31:01.998
You don't have to
be so nervous.

31:01.999 --> 31:06.002
I'm not gonna rat you out
to your rabbi or anything.

31:06.003 --> 31:07.336
Are you jewish?

31:07.337 --> 31:10.306
Well, I dropped out
of hebrew school,

31:10.307 --> 31:11.875
So I don't know if that counts.

31:11.876 --> 31:14.277
She talk your ear off yet?

31:14.278 --> 31:15.444
Does it count?

31:15.445 --> 31:17.781
I want you
to meet somebody, sammy.

31:17.782 --> 31:18.948
Hi, baby.

31:18.949 --> 31:20.716
Hi, baby. Are you sam?

31:20.717 --> 31:21.851
Oh.

31:21.852 --> 31:23.553
Mr. Solomon. Nice to meet you.

31:23.554 --> 31:25.121
Mr. Solomon, nice to meet you.

31:25.122 --> 31:27.123
Come here. I want to talk
to you for a second.

31:27.124 --> 31:30.093
Uh, baby, show yose
where he's sleeping.

31:32.362 --> 31:33.696
Have a seat.

31:33.697 --> 31:35.364
Thank you, mr. Solomon.

31:35.365 --> 31:36.866
Jackie... call me "jackie.
" thank you, jackie.

31:36.867 --> 31:38.034
You work on delancey
and orchard.

31:38.035 --> 31:39.268
Is that correct? Uh, yeah.

31:39.269 --> 31:41.337
You know I used to work there?

31:41.338 --> 31:42.505
You worked there?

31:42.506 --> 31:45.508
Yeah, I hated that block...
ever since the chinks.

31:45.509 --> 31:47.376
And the fucking "f" train
over there sucks.

31:47.377 --> 31:49.545
What are you, a 10?
You look like you're about a 10.

31:49.546 --> 31:53.216
There you go.
This is for you, sam.

31:53.217 --> 31:54.550
Try them on.

31:54.551 --> 31:57.887
Now? Yeah, try them on.

31:57.888 --> 32:00.890
Does your mom know
about the medicine, sam?

32:00.891 --> 32:02.992
It's called ecstasy,
and it's illegal.

32:02.993 --> 32:05.661
I mean, what's illegal?
In israel, advil's illegal.

32:05.662 --> 32:08.231
The most important thing
you need to know, sam...

32:08.232 --> 32:10.666
It's not addictive,
it's actually therapeutic.

32:10.667 --> 32:13.336
It actually helps people
open up their emotions.

32:15.506 --> 32:19.042
You know, yose told me
what a great job you did.

32:19.043 --> 32:20.976
Go ahead. Try them on.

32:20.977 --> 32:24.147
Mr. Solomon,
I-I work with my father.

32:24.148 --> 32:25.581
I know you work
with your father, sam,

32:25.582 --> 32:27.016
But you have to
understand something.

32:27.017 --> 32:28.518
We're talking about
a lot of money here.

32:28.519 --> 32:30.520
I'm willing to offer you
$1,500 a trip.

32:30.521 --> 32:33.322
Plus I'll give you $200 for
every carrier you find me...

32:33.323 --> 32:34.524
Plus all expenses paid.

32:34.525 --> 32:36.526
Do they fit? Yeah.

32:36.527 --> 32:39.362
Good. They look great.

32:39.363 --> 32:41.164
You know,
I really like you, sam.

32:41.165 --> 32:42.965
I like you, too,
mr. So... jackie.

32:42.966 --> 32:45.134
Always call me "jackie."
I will.

32:46.836 --> 32:49.004
One second.

32:49.005 --> 32:50.339
Shmuel.

32:50.340 --> 32:52.441
Come in.

32:54.912 --> 32:56.212
Where were you?

32:56.213 --> 32:57.479
I had a job interview.

32:57.480 --> 32:59.515
Job? What job interview?

32:59.516 --> 33:01.351
No, don't worry.
It was with a very nice man.

33:01.352 --> 33:02.485
He's israeli.

33:02.486 --> 33:04.354
He imports all sorts of
pricy goods from europe.

33:04.355 --> 33:05.755
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:05.756 --> 33:07.690
You... you work in the store.
You study.

33:07.691 --> 33:09.625
<i>I thought it would be a good
idea to make some extra gelt.</i>

33:09.626 --> 33:11.027
Why? Why? Why?

33:11.028 --> 33:14.931
Why is it so important for you
with the whole money issue?

33:14.932 --> 33:17.600
I did a good job.

33:37.288 --> 33:41.124
Is there something
you want to tell me, shmuel?

33:49.400 --> 33:51.567
You shouldn't miss dinner.

34:22.065 --> 34:24.733
Sorry.

34:52.996 --> 34:54.964
Stop!

34:56.900 --> 34:58.033
Sam!

34:58.034 --> 35:00.002
I have something for you.

35:00.003 --> 35:01.971
I want you to put it on.
It's italian.

35:01.972 --> 35:03.539
Do you like designer clothes?

35:03.540 --> 35:04.874
Yes, yes. Thank you.

35:04.875 --> 35:07.109
Also, give this to your mom
when you get home, okay?

35:07.110 --> 35:08.944
Okay. What did you get
for yourself?

35:08.945 --> 35:10.613
Come on, baby.

35:10.614 --> 35:12.448
Is, uh... is yosef coming back?

35:12.449 --> 35:14.984
- Don't worry about yosef.
- Get dressed.

35:14.985 --> 35:18.787
We're going out tonight.
We're in fucking amsterdam.

35:24.228 --> 35:26.395
You look good. Thank you.

35:26.396 --> 35:27.897
Are you nervous? No.

35:27.898 --> 35:30.666
No.

35:33.003 --> 35:35.270
Hey, what's up?
What are you doing?

35:35.271 --> 35:37.473
Hi. How are you?
Nice to see you.

35:50.187 --> 35:53.356
What are you doing?

35:53.357 --> 35:55.925
<i>What are you doing? Come on.</i>

35:55.926 --> 35:57.093
Meet me in the bathroom, girls.

35:57.094 --> 35:59.095
Everything's upstairs.

37:26.049 --> 37:28.350
I want to go back
to the apartment.

37:28.351 --> 37:29.785
They're just having fun.

37:29.786 --> 37:31.954
Take me back to the apartment.

37:31.955 --> 37:33.956
Well, I can't.

37:35.491 --> 37:37.659
I'm supposed to babysit you.

37:37.660 --> 37:39.594
I can babysit myself,
thank you very much.

37:39.595 --> 37:41.496
You can't babysit yourself.

37:41.497 --> 37:43.632
You know what?
You should go back inside.

37:43.633 --> 37:46.769
You should
go have some more fun.

37:46.770 --> 37:50.239
Sam, give me your fucking coat.
I'm freezing.

37:50.240 --> 37:53.275
Just give it to me, please.
I'm cold.

37:55.078 --> 37:58.247
Ooh. That's soft.

38:01.051 --> 38:02.618
How do you feel?

38:02.619 --> 38:05.287
I feel fine.
You're acting very strange.

38:05.288 --> 38:07.423
I feel amazing.

38:10.360 --> 38:13.696
Oh, my god.
I think I see our apartment.

38:13.697 --> 38:16.365
What? Where?

38:16.366 --> 38:19.702
I do. I see it. I see it.
Come here.

38:19.703 --> 38:23.873
You have to get really close
to see it, though.

38:23.874 --> 38:26.208
Can you see it now?

38:26.209 --> 38:28.544
No.

38:32.982 --> 38:35.651
Jackie likes you.

38:35.652 --> 38:37.052
Where's the apartment?

38:37.053 --> 38:40.389
He really likes you a lot,
you know, 'cause you're not...

38:40.390 --> 38:45.561
You're not like the other guys,
I mean, because...

38:45.562 --> 38:48.898
It's like you're pure
or something, you know?

38:48.899 --> 38:52.568
I think I should
talk more or less.

38:52.569 --> 38:54.904
I can't tell.

38:56.673 --> 38:59.641
Are you homesick?

39:06.182 --> 39:08.851
I want to go sit down.

39:08.852 --> 39:10.686
Okay.

39:10.687 --> 39:12.922
Okay.

39:18.562 --> 39:21.897
Come here.

39:21.898 --> 39:23.732
Come here, sweetie.

39:23.733 --> 39:25.901
No.

39:25.902 --> 39:28.638
Shit.

39:28.639 --> 39:31.674
Oh, my god.

39:31.675 --> 39:34.677
Fucking amazing.

39:34.678 --> 39:39.515
I think that
this is the softest jacket...

39:39.516 --> 39:44.086
In the entire universe.

39:44.087 --> 39:45.988
It's wool with cashmere.

39:45.989 --> 39:48.824
My god.

39:57.033 --> 40:02.004
Do this slower... like, slower.

40:18.021 --> 40:19.188
You okay?

40:19.189 --> 40:22.191
I'm great. Perfect.
How are you?

40:22.192 --> 40:24.526
Let's do this.

40:24.527 --> 40:26.328
Give me the suitcase.

40:26.329 --> 40:29.131
Oh, have the kid
bring the cash.

40:29.132 --> 40:30.366
What?

40:30.367 --> 40:33.869
Have the kid bring
the fucking cash. Let's go.

40:33.870 --> 40:35.871
Let's go.

40:35.872 --> 40:37.706
Leave the bitch in the car.
Come on.

40:37.707 --> 40:38.707
No.

40:38.708 --> 40:40.042
Sorry. She's fine.

40:40.043 --> 40:41.944
Hide your hard-on, will you?

40:41.945 --> 40:45.447
Don't fuck up and don't
say anything, all right?

40:45.448 --> 40:48.250
What am I supposed to do?

40:48.251 --> 40:50.085
Just don't say anything,
all right?

40:54.791 --> 40:58.027
Looking for ephraim.

40:58.028 --> 41:01.329
I need 50,000 pills
boxed and sealed now.

41:01.330 --> 41:03.298
Let's go!

41:03.299 --> 41:05.634
If I find
one fucking pill missing,

41:05.635 --> 41:08.170
I'm gonna chop
your fucking hands off!

41:08.171 --> 41:09.604
Stay close.

41:09.605 --> 41:11.440
<i>There's my meshugga.</i>

41:11.441 --> 41:13.242
What's up, ephraim?
How you doing?

41:13.243 --> 41:15.410
Hey, what's going?
Who's the bar mitzvah boy?

41:15.411 --> 41:17.412
He's just my new guy.
Don't worry about it.

41:17.413 --> 41:20.182
Well, new guy, let me show you
what we do here.

41:20.183 --> 41:22.350
This operation here...

41:22.351 --> 41:25.720
This thing's capable of
producing 300 pills a minute,

41:25.721 --> 41:27.056
Over 100,000 an hour.

41:27.057 --> 41:28.957
What's with the machine guns?

41:28.958 --> 41:31.693
Oh, you know, got raids,
killings, you know.

41:31.694 --> 41:32.961
I didn't hear anything.

41:32.962 --> 41:35.164
Yeah, I had to go up
on everything...

41:35.165 --> 41:36.965
Production, security, prices.

41:36.966 --> 41:40.302
You know, I have to raise up
on that friends-and-family code.

41:40.303 --> 41:42.637
What do you mean?
I'm already paying $2 a pill.

41:42.638 --> 41:44.573
What the fuck does
it cost them... 20 cents?

41:44.574 --> 41:45.807
What it costs?

41:45.808 --> 41:47.342
Don't worry about what
it costs me, all right?

41:47.343 --> 41:49.444
This is a business.
This is not a club.

41:49.445 --> 41:51.613
You better not
be fucking me, ephraim.

41:51.614 --> 41:53.615
What did I just say, jack?
Are you deaf?

41:53.616 --> 41:55.350
I got guys pounding down my door
for this stuff.

41:55.351 --> 41:57.352
No, you don't. You got me,
and you fucking know it.

41:57.353 --> 41:59.188
I'm the only motherfucker that's
bringing this shit into new york.

41:59.189 --> 42:00.522
I got other people, all right?

42:00.523 --> 42:02.224
Yeah, but I'm the best,

42:02.225 --> 42:04.226
And there's nobody better
than my guys.

42:04.227 --> 42:05.694
Ohh.

42:05.695 --> 42:08.364
Sam, get yose out of here.

42:08.365 --> 42:10.065
Jackie, can I talk to you
for a second?

42:10.066 --> 42:11.867
Not now. Get him out of here.

42:11.868 --> 42:13.401
Jackie, it's important...
please.

42:13.402 --> 42:14.369
What's going on?

42:14.370 --> 42:16.371
Don't worry about it.
One second. Excuse me.

42:16.372 --> 42:18.240
What, you got to go to
the bathroom or something?

42:18.241 --> 42:21.009
No. Look, with
his new machines,

42:21.010 --> 42:22.111
The supply is going up,

42:22.112 --> 42:23.678
So the prices
should not be going up.

42:23.679 --> 42:25.013
Yeah?

42:25.014 --> 42:28.016
Yeah, well, if you know that,
everybody knows that.

42:28.017 --> 42:29.784
Look, you need me,
and you know it.

42:29.785 --> 42:31.686
I'm gonna do you
a fucking favor here.

42:31.687 --> 42:32.988
I'm not gonna walk away.

42:32.989 --> 42:35.991
So, I'm just gonna take my
original deal, and that's that.

42:35.992 --> 42:38.059
Oh. Well, I-I don't think
you understand.

42:38.060 --> 42:39.161
What's going on here,

42:39.162 --> 42:41.130
So why don't you take
your sick friend.

42:41.131 --> 42:42.864
And stop wasting
my fucking time?

42:42.865 --> 42:44.099
Really? Yes, really.

42:44.100 --> 42:45.267
Like that? Yes.

42:45.268 --> 42:46.602
All right. Then I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

42:46.603 --> 42:48.270
All right, let's go.

42:48.271 --> 42:50.606
Wait. Sir... sam!

42:50.607 --> 42:52.707
Sir, assuming
one of your machines.

42:52.708 --> 42:55.677
Is operating 24 hours a day
for 7 days a week,

42:55.678 --> 42:57.846
It can produce more than
1.4 million pills a week.

42:57.847 --> 42:59.181
You need to keep
those pills moving.

42:59.182 --> 43:00.583
We can help you do that.

43:00.584 --> 43:03.352
Now, if one of your buyers finds
out that your supply is greater,

43:03.353 --> 43:04.553
He's gonna cut his prices.

43:04.554 --> 43:07.422
Word is gonna spread,
and people will talk.

43:09.592 --> 43:11.760
Hi. How you doing?

43:11.761 --> 43:13.028
Okay.

43:13.029 --> 43:16.698
I never thanked you
for yesterday.

43:16.699 --> 43:18.033
You said some pretty good shit.

43:18.034 --> 43:19.534
Oh. Well, I spoke out of turn.

43:19.535 --> 43:21.370
Yeah. Yeah.

43:21.371 --> 43:23.205
In the future,
you should probably,

43:23.206 --> 43:25.607
You know, shut your mouth.

43:25.608 --> 43:26.842
Okay.

43:26.843 --> 43:29.178
Yeah. You got to be careful.
This is some serious shit.

43:29.179 --> 43:31.379
I know. Okay. Okay?

43:31.380 --> 43:33.782
You know, you don't
want to get too smart.

43:33.783 --> 43:34.783
What do you mean?

43:34.784 --> 43:37.118
You don't want to
get too smart.

43:37.119 --> 43:38.620
You know, 'cause jackie...
oh, jackie.

43:38.621 --> 43:39.788
Yeah. Okay.

43:39.789 --> 43:42.524
I mean, he loves you now,
but you never know.

43:42.525 --> 43:44.459
He could drop you any second.

43:44.460 --> 43:46.295
Really? Yeah.

43:46.296 --> 43:48.129
Okay. All right.
Don't get too smart.

43:48.130 --> 43:50.632
You know, just a tip.

43:50.633 --> 43:52.267
Thank you, and I'm sorry.

43:52.268 --> 43:53.602
Sorry? No,
you don't have to apologize.

43:53.603 --> 43:54.936
You did a great job. Okay.

43:54.937 --> 43:56.771
I mean, you could have
got us all killed.

43:56.772 --> 43:59.274
But you did a great job.

43:59.275 --> 44:00.575
Okay.

44:00.576 --> 44:02.477
Just remember
who brought you in.

44:02.478 --> 44:04.646
You did.

44:04.647 --> 44:07.649
Okay. All right.

44:25.101 --> 44:27.669
Sam!

44:27.670 --> 44:29.171
Sam!

44:29.172 --> 44:32.040
Jackie. How are you?

44:32.041 --> 44:35.177
Good to see you.
So, this is it?

44:35.178 --> 44:37.379
This is where
you've been working?

44:37.380 --> 44:40.349
Uh... Tateh,
this is mr. Solomon.

44:40.350 --> 44:44.219
Mr. Gold, jackie solomon.
A pleasure to meet you.

44:44.220 --> 44:46.888
You know, I never appreciated
working with my dad.

44:46.889 --> 44:48.557
Until he was gone, sam.

44:48.558 --> 44:51.893
Well, hopefully,
shmuel knows better than that.

44:51.894 --> 44:53.895
Oh, I'm sure he does.

44:53.896 --> 44:55.497
He's been a great help
to my business.

44:55.498 --> 44:56.832
He was? Yes, incredible.

44:56.833 --> 44:57.967
Not so great.

44:57.968 --> 45:00.902
Oh, no, he's one
of the smartest kids I know.

45:00.903 --> 45:02.404
And I'm sure he's gonna make
a great rabbi.

45:02.405 --> 45:03.738
I mean, that's the goal, right?

45:03.739 --> 45:05.907
Shmuel's been working for you?

45:05.908 --> 45:09.411
Well, a little bit, just lately.
He's been doing a great job.

45:09.412 --> 45:11.580
I enjoy working
with mr. Solomon.

45:11.581 --> 45:14.583
And I enjoy working with sam.
He's been great.

45:14.584 --> 45:17.553
If there's anything that you
ever need, just give me a call.

45:17.554 --> 45:18.720
Yes. Sure.

45:21.391 --> 45:23.725
I'll see you guys later.

45:27.897 --> 45:30.065
It's too much, shmuel!
Shmuel! Tateh, it's fine!

45:30.066 --> 45:32.000
No, this is... no!

45:34.604 --> 45:38.273
<i>You don't listen!</i>

45:52.355 --> 45:54.856
Usually we recruit
in three neighborhoods...

45:54.857 --> 45:56.591
Williamsburg, crown heights,
borough park.

45:56.592 --> 45:59.527
Try to avoid groups.

45:59.528 --> 46:01.696
Look for stragglers,
young families...

46:01.697 --> 46:04.499
People that need extra money and
won't ask too many questions.

46:04.500 --> 46:06.401
You know what I'm saying?
Just sell it.

46:06.402 --> 46:08.870
Sammy gold, the salesman.

46:08.871 --> 46:12.574
You're a good salesman,
right, sammy gold?

46:12.575 --> 46:14.242
Show time.

46:14.243 --> 46:17.579
You all right?

46:17.580 --> 46:18.914
Yeah.

46:18.915 --> 46:22.417
You're all right. You'll get it.
Watch the master.

46:30.426 --> 46:32.026
Excuse me, sir.

46:32.027 --> 46:35.597
How are you? How are you doing?

46:35.598 --> 46:37.799
Listen, I have a golden
opportunity for you.

46:37.800 --> 46:39.133
How are you?

46:39.134 --> 46:43.137
Let me ask you a question.
Are you from around here?

46:43.138 --> 46:45.840
What are you in a rush for?

46:45.841 --> 46:48.743
Oy, ziggy, talk to your boss.

46:48.744 --> 46:51.213
Boys, come here.
Give me a hand.

46:52.549 --> 46:55.551
Take the children inside.
Can I help you?

46:55.552 --> 46:58.220
Uh, no. Thank you.

47:00.523 --> 47:01.856
This is so heavy.

47:01.857 --> 47:04.359
<i>Vartn.</i>

47:04.360 --> 47:06.327
If you could help my wife...

47:08.798 --> 47:11.099
<i>Shalom aleichem.</i>

47:11.100 --> 47:14.602
Ma'am, have you ever
been to europe?

47:14.603 --> 47:16.304
Wait, the bear... wait, wait.

47:16.305 --> 47:17.939
The bear and the rabbit
shit in the woods.

47:17.940 --> 47:20.442
Okay, hold on. I know, I know,
I know. Hold on. They can wait.

47:20.443 --> 47:21.943
The bear and the rabbit
shit in the woods.

47:21.944 --> 47:24.713
The rabbit... the bear turns
to the rabbit and says, "hey."

47:24.714 --> 47:27.449
Hold on one second.
Can you hold on one second?

47:27.450 --> 47:29.117
The... the bear
says to the rabbit,

47:29.118 --> 47:30.452
"hey, have you shit
here before?"

47:30.453 --> 47:32.120
And then the...

47:32.121 --> 47:35.123
What the fuck are you
talking about, seriously?

47:35.124 --> 47:37.726
These are fucking andrew's guys
from brighten.

47:37.727 --> 47:39.261
They pay $40 a fucking pill.

47:39.262 --> 47:41.062
Watch the way
I handle these guys.

47:41.063 --> 47:42.230
All right, cool.

47:42.231 --> 47:44.299
Yeah, yeah, cool. Cool.

47:44.300 --> 47:45.800
I hope you guys are not wasting
my fucking time here.

47:45.801 --> 47:47.469
That was bullshit.

47:47.470 --> 47:48.704
He had us going over bridges.

47:48.705 --> 47:50.071
And through tunnels in
the fucking mystery machine.

47:50.072 --> 47:52.374
You mean brooklyn? Really?

47:52.375 --> 47:53.775
I don't know
about the other customers,

47:53.776 --> 47:55.176
But we got a lot of money.
Cool out, man.

47:55.177 --> 47:58.212
Yeah, what's up with your boys,
andrew, seriously?

47:58.213 --> 47:59.648
Hey, bro, I got like 20 bitches.

47:59.649 --> 48:01.817
That are ready for this shit,
so let's get it on.

48:01.818 --> 48:04.419
Who are these characters you got
working for you? What's that?

48:04.420 --> 48:05.820
Hi, boys.

48:05.821 --> 48:08.657
That's why you don't
buy drugs from a jew.

48:08.658 --> 48:09.991
What the fuck did you say,
bitch?

48:09.992 --> 48:11.993
It's unprofessional.
Unprofessional?

48:11.994 --> 48:15.330
Well, excuse me for being
un-fucking-professional, andrew.

48:15.331 --> 48:16.831
Come here. Come here.

48:16.832 --> 48:18.467
Go ahead. No, no, no, no!

48:18.468 --> 48:20.202
No? All right, hold on.
I'll be back.

48:33.516 --> 48:36.485
Jackie, hey.
I'm almost ready to lock up.

48:36.486 --> 48:38.253
Is it all here? Yeah.

48:38.254 --> 48:42.290
Okay, good. Good job. Thank you.

48:42.291 --> 48:45.593
Sam, turn around, please.

48:45.594 --> 48:46.862
Yeah.

48:52.468 --> 48:54.068
Hey, sam? Yeah?

48:54.069 --> 48:55.170
I need you to do me a favor.

48:55.171 --> 48:56.705
I need you to take
some of my cash to europe.

48:56.706 --> 48:57.906
When are you leaving?

48:57.907 --> 49:00.608
Uh, we could do, uh, Sunday
first thing, no problem.

49:00.609 --> 49:01.810
Sunday is good.

49:01.811 --> 49:03.145
Me and rachel are leaving
tomorrow morning,

49:03.146 --> 49:04.646
So that makes sense.

49:04.647 --> 49:06.848
All right. But we're going out
tonight. You want to come?

49:06.849 --> 49:09.384
Jackie, it's shabbos.
I can't go out.

49:09.385 --> 49:11.286
- That's right.
- It is shabbos.

49:11.287 --> 49:13.055
I forgot. I got to call my mom.

49:15.558 --> 49:19.060
Hi, mama.

49:19.061 --> 49:20.695
<i>Shabbat shalom.</i>

49:20.696 --> 49:22.897
Jackie. Hey, jackie.

49:28.237 --> 49:30.238
Okay, I love you, too, mama.

49:33.576 --> 49:35.910
Okay. Okay, I love you.

49:35.911 --> 49:36.878
I got to go.

49:36.879 --> 49:38.413
<i>Shabbat shalom. Jackie.</i>

49:38.414 --> 49:41.082
Bye. See...

49:41.083 --> 49:42.250
What are you doing?

49:42.251 --> 49:44.886
I got my mother that new stove.
I got to go.

49:44.887 --> 49:47.356
<i>Wish her shabbat shalom.
She'll like that.</i>

49:47.357 --> 49:48.690
Thanks, jackie.

49:48.691 --> 49:49.858
<i>Shabbat shalom.</i>

49:49.859 --> 49:52.194
<i>Shabbat shalom.</i>

49:55.197 --> 49:58.700
Really? Thank you very much.

50:01.905 --> 50:04.406
Tateh!

50:04.407 --> 50:06.408
Mama!

50:12.715 --> 50:15.183
What's wrong?

50:15.184 --> 50:18.654
We don't want it.

50:23.960 --> 50:26.461
Shmuel! Shmuel!

50:26.462 --> 50:27.529
What?

50:27.530 --> 50:28.864
You're ruining our family.

50:28.865 --> 50:30.298
I don't need this from you
right now! Go to yeshiva!

50:30.299 --> 50:31.299
You're ruining our family!

50:31.300 --> 50:33.301
I don't need this from you!

50:33.302 --> 50:35.403
How can you do this?! Stop it!

50:35.404 --> 50:36.738
Zeldy! Zeldy! Zeldy!

50:36.739 --> 50:38.506
Stop it!
Zeldy's marrying someone else!

50:38.507 --> 50:39.941
What? You don't deserve her.

50:39.942 --> 50:41.442
What? Who is she marrying?

50:41.443 --> 50:42.844
He's a good man.
He's going to be a rabbi.

50:42.845 --> 50:44.712
Who is it?! Tell me who it is!

50:44.713 --> 50:47.048
Leon.

51:02.965 --> 51:05.734
You know, amsterdam used to be
called new jerusalem,

51:05.735 --> 51:07.903
And new york used to be called
new amsterdam.

51:07.904 --> 51:09.237
Really? Yeah.

51:09.238 --> 51:11.239
Well, now amsterdam
is fucking disneyland.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.741
For fat and faggot americans.

51:12.742 --> 51:14.409
You're a fat
and faggot american.

51:14.410 --> 51:16.244
Really? I'll have sex
with you right now.

51:16.245 --> 51:17.746
To prove that I'm not a faggot.

51:17.747 --> 51:19.581
Hey! Fuck you.

51:21.083 --> 51:23.184
What the hell's
wrong with you?!

51:23.185 --> 51:24.886
No. I'm being polite.

51:24.887 --> 51:27.555
You tired, sam?
It was a long flight, right?

51:27.556 --> 51:28.823
No, I'm okay.

51:28.824 --> 51:30.225
You know, the anne frank house
is here, as well.

51:30.226 --> 51:32.426
I'd like to see that. I know.
I've tried to go twice.

51:32.427 --> 51:34.595
And both times
the line was too long.

51:34.596 --> 51:36.197
That's 'cause you were stoned.

51:36.198 --> 51:39.200
Sammy boy, good job.
See this town?

51:39.201 --> 51:41.036
I run this fucking town, buddy.

51:41.037 --> 51:43.038
I know.

51:43.039 --> 51:44.740
This town? I hate this town.

52:05.828 --> 52:07.929
Any questions?

52:07.930 --> 52:08.997
- No.
- Good.

52:08.998 --> 52:11.399
Don't worry.
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

52:11.400 --> 52:13.301
You're both very smart people.

52:13.302 --> 52:15.403
Does this medicine
really help people?

52:15.404 --> 52:17.672
You're doing a mitzvah
for your family.

52:17.673 --> 52:20.408
You should both be very proud.

52:20.409 --> 52:22.110
Here. Try this on.

52:22.111 --> 52:24.746
It's heavy.

52:24.747 --> 52:26.114
Don't touch it.

52:26.115 --> 52:27.782
Come on. We're gonna
miss your flight.

52:27.783 --> 52:30.451
Please. We need a moment alone.

52:30.452 --> 52:34.288
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Make it quick.

52:39.161 --> 52:41.696
Sheep follow sheep.

52:41.697 --> 52:43.297
I'm not a sheep, rebbe.

52:43.298 --> 52:44.799
I don't know what that means.

52:44.800 --> 52:46.467
It means there are rumors.

52:46.468 --> 52:48.703
Spreading in the community
about you.

52:48.704 --> 52:51.073
I import garments wholesale.

52:51.074 --> 52:54.276
Your good friend leon
is very concerned.

52:54.277 --> 52:56.711
I've not spoken to leon
for a long time.

52:56.712 --> 52:57.812
I travel.

52:57.813 --> 52:59.747
People get ideas...
their imagination.

53:02.085 --> 53:05.454
Tell yosef I would like to
talk to him... clear this up.

53:05.455 --> 53:06.588
Absolutely.

53:06.589 --> 53:09.091
When... if I see yosef,
I will tell him.

53:09.092 --> 53:10.925
Absolutely.

53:13.129 --> 53:16.130
Did you really give your
blessing to the lazar family?

53:16.131 --> 53:20.034
I came to ask the questions
tonight, young shmuel.

53:20.035 --> 53:23.271
Be careful.

53:23.272 --> 53:26.541
The imagination
is very dangerous.

53:26.542 --> 53:29.043
You have two bags.

53:29.044 --> 53:32.414
Okay.

53:32.415 --> 53:35.350
All right, I'll be right back.

53:35.351 --> 53:38.052
Then on the 1st, pay for...

53:38.053 --> 53:39.387
Hi. No, don't worry.

53:39.388 --> 53:41.222
I got it. Put your money away.

53:41.223 --> 53:43.691
I got it. What are you getting?
There... right there.

53:43.692 --> 53:45.026
There you go.
Don't worry, my friend.

53:45.027 --> 53:46.061
I'm one of you. It's okay.

53:46.062 --> 53:47.962
I think that's debatable.

53:49.031 --> 53:52.233
Take the bag to the truck.
I'll be right there.

53:53.502 --> 53:57.171
Keep your head down.

53:57.172 --> 53:59.707
Stay away from my boy, shmuel.

53:59.708 --> 54:01.142
Why would the lazars
agree to you?

54:01.143 --> 54:02.377
You don't have any money.

54:02.378 --> 54:04.245
You don't even have a father
to work for.

54:04.246 --> 54:08.083
It's not about the money...
never.

54:08.084 --> 54:10.986
They want a shepherd
to protect her from the wolves.

54:12.688 --> 54:14.455
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

54:14.456 --> 54:17.358
I'm sure your father's
very proud.

54:17.359 --> 54:20.194
Leon.

54:20.195 --> 54:22.229
Hey, leon.

54:22.230 --> 54:23.465
Hey.

54:23.466 --> 54:26.667
Cast your burden on hashem,
and he will sustain you.

54:26.668 --> 54:28.103
Hey, come here!

54:28.104 --> 54:30.438
Hey, leon! Where you going?!

54:30.439 --> 54:33.041
Baby brother, I got you
a present! Come here!

54:33.042 --> 54:36.044
Yosef.

54:36.045 --> 54:37.746
Sam, get in the car.

54:40.082 --> 54:42.750
Let's go.

54:42.751 --> 54:44.518
- Straighten out.
- Yeah.

54:44.519 --> 54:46.320
All right, look straight.
If two people drive,

54:46.321 --> 54:48.589
There are too many cooks in the kitchen.
Just go straight.

54:48.590 --> 54:52.127
Pull up right over next to that
building right there, okay?

54:52.128 --> 54:53.494
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
stop, stop, stop!

54:53.495 --> 54:54.595
Brake, brake, brake, brake!

54:54.596 --> 54:56.564
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa! Wrong!

54:56.565 --> 54:57.899
Put it in park. Sorry.

54:57.900 --> 54:59.133
Geez.

55:02.137 --> 55:04.071
My god, I saw my life
flash before my eyes.

55:04.072 --> 55:05.139
Sorry.

55:05.140 --> 55:07.341
I got to start wearing
this seat-belt thing.

55:07.342 --> 55:09.210
You really should.
All right, here we go.

55:09.211 --> 55:11.212
Don't touch anything,
all right?

55:11.213 --> 55:13.981
All right.
Can I turn the radio on? No.

55:13.982 --> 55:17.585
There he is... the bald wonder.

55:17.586 --> 55:19.086
Yo, yo!

55:24.526 --> 55:25.927
Yosef, yosef. How are you?

55:25.928 --> 55:27.262
Good. How are you?

55:27.263 --> 55:28.696
I think I'm getting a cavity.

55:28.697 --> 55:30.198
<i>You're tuned in
to stretch armstrong.</i>

55:30.199 --> 55:31.799
<i>I'm feeling good.</i>

55:31.800 --> 55:33.368
<i>New york city,
what is going on?</i>

55:36.038 --> 55:38.206
Move over.

55:40.877 --> 55:43.277
Take 50 g's out
and give jackie the rest.

55:43.278 --> 55:45.480
$50,000? For what?

55:45.481 --> 55:47.282
Laundering. That's my fee.

55:47.283 --> 55:50.085
Your fee? What...
what are you charging them?

55:50.086 --> 55:52.887
What do you mean,
how much I'm charging them?

55:52.888 --> 55:54.889
These men are... I charge them
what I charge them.

55:54.890 --> 55:58.593
Okay. Wait. So,
does jackie know about them?

55:58.594 --> 56:00.261
What did I tell you
about jackie?

56:00.262 --> 56:01.596
What?

56:01.597 --> 56:04.099
Don't get too smart.
Don't get too smart.

56:04.100 --> 56:05.933
Jackie doesn't need to know.

56:05.934 --> 56:08.069
He doesn't... he doesn't
appreciate a smarty.

56:08.070 --> 56:09.603
Like I appreciate a smarty.

56:09.604 --> 56:11.839
Thank you.

56:11.840 --> 56:14.008
You want to get some pizza?
Yeah. I'm starving.

56:14.009 --> 56:15.009
Let's do it.

56:15.010 --> 56:16.844
Hey, can I drive
on the way back?

56:16.845 --> 56:18.846
No!

56:23.886 --> 56:26.053
I want...
I want to give a toast.

56:26.054 --> 56:27.221
Uh...

56:27.222 --> 56:28.322
Yosef.

56:28.323 --> 56:30.158
Yosef, I want to make a toast.

56:30.159 --> 56:32.861
To good business and good
friends, in that order.

56:32.862 --> 56:34.562
<i>Cheers. Lehayim.</i>

56:34.563 --> 56:35.730
<i>Lehayim. Lehayim.</i>

56:35.731 --> 56:36.898
<i>Lehayim, sam.</i>

56:36.899 --> 56:39.433
<i>Lehayim, sam.</i>

56:39.434 --> 56:41.102
Mmm, mmm!

56:41.103 --> 56:42.771
Okay.

56:42.772 --> 56:44.438
Sam, have you ever had sushi?

56:44.439 --> 56:45.673
Uh, no.

56:45.674 --> 56:49.010
This is some
smoked-salmon sushi.

56:49.011 --> 56:50.678
It's like, um... it's like lox.

56:50.679 --> 56:52.347
<i>Okay. We'll baruch over this.</i>

56:52.348 --> 56:53.514
Just try it.

56:53.515 --> 56:55.183
Okay. I can feed myself,
thank you.

56:55.184 --> 56:56.784
Okay. Mmm.

56:56.785 --> 56:58.453
Who wants more? Mmm.

56:58.454 --> 56:59.554
It's good, right?

56:59.555 --> 57:00.922
Yeah, I'll have another one,
honey, please.

57:00.923 --> 57:02.390
I think I like it better
with the bagel.

57:02.391 --> 57:05.893
Jackie!

57:05.894 --> 57:07.728
It's good to see you.

57:07.729 --> 57:10.398
I haven't seen you
in a long time.

57:10.399 --> 57:12.567
That's it. Nice to see you.

57:12.568 --> 57:14.069
Yosef.

57:14.070 --> 57:15.403
What? Oh, hey.

57:15.404 --> 57:17.872
How you been? How you doing?

57:17.873 --> 57:20.508
Take care of that cavity?

57:20.509 --> 57:24.746
<i>Lehayim. Lehayim.
Enjoy, everybody.</i>

57:58.247 --> 57:59.413
Sam!

58:05.687 --> 58:06.687
Come on.

58:11.193 --> 58:14.195
Please? It's okay.

59:42.351 --> 59:45.286
This is the best medicine ever.

59:45.287 --> 59:48.689
Shabbat
is a state of mind, pal.

59:48.690 --> 59:52.493
Sometimes my eyes
go out of focus.

59:52.494 --> 59:56.063
And then back in focus.

59:56.064 --> 01:00:00.167
There it goes again.

01:00:00.168 --> 01:00:02.670
Can we stop for a second
so I can trip for a minute?

01:00:02.671 --> 01:00:03.738
Yeah, please?

01:00:03.739 --> 01:00:06.240
Jackie, pull over real quick,
will you?

01:00:06.241 --> 01:00:08.776
Come on, pull over real quick?

01:00:08.777 --> 01:00:12.546
Pull over real quick.
I got to show sammy something.

01:00:12.547 --> 01:00:14.582
Sammy, grab your sneakers.

01:00:14.583 --> 01:00:17.185
What are we doing?
What do you mean?

01:00:17.186 --> 01:00:19.387
Why do I need my shoes?

01:00:57.626 --> 01:01:04.031
What happens next can only
be described as tragic.

01:01:04.032 --> 01:01:09.337
And the sons of aaron,
nadav and avihu,

01:01:09.338 --> 01:01:14.842
Each took his fire pan,
placed within it fire,

01:01:14.843 --> 01:01:19.013
And placed incense upon it.

01:01:19.014 --> 01:01:24.685
And they offered
a strange fire before hashem,

01:01:24.686 --> 01:01:29.290
One that he did not
command of them,

01:01:29.291 --> 01:01:35.796
And the fire came forth
before hashem and devoured them,

01:01:35.797 --> 01:01:40.801
And they died before hashem.

01:01:40.802 --> 01:01:43.304
Elka! There you go.

01:01:43.305 --> 01:01:45.473
Elka! Okay, I'm coming!
I'm coming!

01:01:45.474 --> 01:01:47.741
You still like me, right?

01:01:47.742 --> 01:01:50.244
Have I kept you all waiting?

01:01:50.245 --> 01:01:52.346
Come here.
Don't worry about it.

01:01:52.347 --> 01:01:54.048
Ruth, you look so lovely.

01:01:54.049 --> 01:01:56.150
Boychik.
Come, yankel. Let's go.

01:01:56.151 --> 01:01:57.485
Are we ready? Yes.

01:01:57.486 --> 01:01:59.286
Shall we?

01:02:08.163 --> 01:02:10.097
<i>Mazel tov! Mazel tov!
Mazel tov! Mazel tov!</i>

01:02:36.692 --> 01:02:39.694
I talked to the rabbe today.

01:02:39.695 --> 01:02:42.863
I talked to the rabbe, too.
We had a good conversation.

01:02:42.864 --> 01:02:44.632
Shmuel?

01:02:44.633 --> 01:02:46.100
Yeah?

01:02:46.101 --> 01:02:48.135
Sit down.

01:02:48.136 --> 01:02:50.805
Uh, actually, tateh,
I have to go somewhere. Sorry.

01:02:50.806 --> 01:02:52.873
I said, "sit down!"

01:03:00.215 --> 01:03:03.117
You lied to him, didn't you?

01:03:03.118 --> 01:03:05.119
Who?

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.788
The rabbe.

01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:09.624
No. I didn't lie. No.
No one is lying, tateh.

01:03:09.625 --> 01:03:11.892
You didn't lie? No.

01:03:11.893 --> 01:03:15.162
Ay, ay, ay, ay.

01:03:18.566 --> 01:03:19.900
Tateh, I didn't do anything.

01:03:21.337 --> 01:03:25.005
When my rabbi comes to my house
looking for a gun,

01:03:25.006 --> 01:03:27.007
I have a criminal in my house.

01:03:27.008 --> 01:03:29.009
Tateh, what did he tell you?
What did the rabbe tell you?

01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:30.645
We have to hide you
from the community.

01:03:30.646 --> 01:03:33.180
You don't have to hide me from
anybody. I didn't do anything.

01:03:33.181 --> 01:03:35.316
We have to hide you from your little brother.
Stop. I didn't do anything.

01:03:35.317 --> 01:03:36.484
Why, shmuel?

01:03:36.485 --> 01:03:39.153
I didn't do anything wrong,
tateh.

01:03:39.154 --> 01:03:41.889
Why? Huh?

01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:43.123
Tateh, I have to go.

01:03:43.925 --> 01:03:49.096
You are a liar.
You are a criminal.

01:03:49.097 --> 01:03:50.865
You're not my son.
Don't say that.

01:03:50.866 --> 01:03:52.332
Don't say that. Tateh...

01:03:52.333 --> 01:03:53.934
I can't look at you.

01:03:53.935 --> 01:03:55.035
No. No.
Tateh, please look at me.

01:03:55.036 --> 01:03:56.036
Look at me!

01:03:56.037 --> 01:03:59.139
Shmuel, please go away!
Go away!

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.476
Go away from my house,
you understand me?!

01:04:01.477 --> 01:04:03.978
Go away!

01:04:35.009 --> 01:04:37.178
Hi. Come on in.

01:04:37.179 --> 01:04:38.846
Now, when you land,

01:04:38.847 --> 01:04:40.347
Make sure no one
checks your belongings.

01:04:40.348 --> 01:04:42.850
That's simple. That's easy.

01:04:42.851 --> 01:04:44.852
Somebody asks you a question,

01:04:44.853 --> 01:04:47.855
You simply give them
a simple answer.

01:04:47.856 --> 01:04:52.026
Most importantly, though,
relax, okay?

01:04:52.027 --> 01:04:53.861
Have a good time.

01:04:53.862 --> 01:04:56.830
Mind your business
and act jewish.

01:05:11.746 --> 01:05:15.582
You look beautiful.

01:05:15.583 --> 01:05:17.418
You look beautiful, too.

01:05:17.419 --> 01:05:18.719
Yose...

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.753
You not so much.

01:05:19.754 --> 01:05:22.055
You missed
your brother's wedding.

01:05:24.993 --> 01:05:28.830
My brother's
none of your business.

01:05:28.831 --> 01:05:33.334
<i>This is your business.
All right?</i>

01:05:35.437 --> 01:05:37.104
Mm.

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:40.074
Yosef, we don't have time.

01:05:40.075 --> 01:05:42.409
The kids are gonna be waiting.
We're gonna miss the flight.

01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:44.077
Ah, we're not gonna
miss the flight.

01:05:44.078 --> 01:05:46.580
The kids can wait two minutes.

01:05:46.581 --> 01:05:48.115
Look, jackie knows
you're skimming, yosef.

01:05:48.116 --> 01:05:49.416
Jackie knows about these guys.

01:05:49.417 --> 01:05:51.752
I can't keep hiding these
side deals in the book any more.

01:05:51.753 --> 01:05:53.754
All right?

01:05:53.755 --> 01:05:54.622
All right?
I'm gonna tell jackie.

01:05:54.623 --> 01:05:58.125
Will you shut the fuck up
about jackie?

01:05:58.126 --> 01:05:59.459
All right.
You shouldn't be doing this.

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:01.128
Just... be right back.

01:06:01.129 --> 01:06:02.095
Okay.

01:06:02.096 --> 01:06:04.131
Yosef...

01:06:05.967 --> 01:06:07.234
Hey.

01:06:07.235 --> 01:06:09.269
You said you'd be alone.

01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:13.440
<i>Who the fuck is this?
I said I'd be alone.</i>

01:06:13.441 --> 01:06:15.943
Ivan, hi. How are you?
Can I have my money, please?

01:06:15.944 --> 01:06:18.111
I am in a rush. I got to go.

01:06:18.112 --> 01:06:19.613
Yeah. Here's the deal...
our buyers...

01:06:19.614 --> 01:06:20.981
They want a bigger cut,

01:06:20.982 --> 01:06:23.216
- Or they'll go elsewhere.
- Okay. Come on, yosef.

01:06:23.217 --> 01:06:27.387
Well, guy, I need my money
or my pills right now.

01:06:27.388 --> 01:06:30.390
Mm-hmm. Okay.
We got your money.

01:06:30.391 --> 01:06:33.761
It's on...
it's on the tab, right?

01:06:33.762 --> 01:06:36.329
Yeah. It's small change.

01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:37.631
You got to look
at the big picture.

01:06:37.632 --> 01:06:39.299
100,000 superman pills...
that's worth $250,000.

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.367
I want that right now.

01:06:40.368 --> 01:06:41.401
What the fuck is going on
right now?

01:06:41.402 --> 01:06:42.502
Hello?! It's on our tab.

01:06:42.503 --> 01:06:44.672
Shut the fuck up,
you understand me?!

01:06:44.673 --> 01:06:47.174
Yosef. No, no.

01:06:47.175 --> 01:06:49.509
I have given you
100,000 superman pills!

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:52.179
No! That's $250,000!

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.281
What the fuck are you doing?!

01:06:54.983 --> 01:06:58.652
Yosef! Yosef!
Yosef, come on! Yosef!

01:06:58.653 --> 01:07:00.621
Hey, hey, hey,
your girlfriend's running away.

01:07:00.622 --> 01:07:03.791
Yosef! Yosef, yosef!

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:15.035
Empty all your pockets...
all of them.

01:07:15.036 --> 01:07:16.637
Really. It's easy to forget.

01:07:16.638 --> 01:07:19.039
We all do. It doesn't mean
you're not smart.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.709
Empty all of your pockets.

01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:23.377
You see? It's easy. Come on.

01:07:23.378 --> 01:07:24.712
Come on. What are you doing?

01:07:24.713 --> 01:07:26.547
Why are we flying from brussels.

01:07:26.548 --> 01:07:28.883
To montreal to get to new york?

01:07:28.884 --> 01:07:30.050
Is that route
a problem for you?

01:07:30.051 --> 01:07:31.151
You said you wanted
to make money.

01:07:31.152 --> 01:07:32.586
I'll be back in 24 hours
with the medicine.

01:07:32.587 --> 01:07:34.221
But what if there is
an emergency?

01:07:34.222 --> 01:07:38.692
An emergency?
Call the front desk. Dial 9.

01:07:38.693 --> 01:07:40.861
Where are you going?

01:07:47.535 --> 01:07:49.036
You lost the pills, the money.

01:07:49.037 --> 01:07:50.037
You want this?

01:07:50.038 --> 01:07:52.039
Fucking unbelievable.
Oh, hi, sam.

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:54.375
Where's my money, yosef?
Nice haircut.

01:07:54.376 --> 01:07:56.944
Uh, we have company, by the way.
Get off the phone.

01:07:56.945 --> 01:07:59.013
Enough already!
Put it somewhere!

01:07:59.014 --> 01:08:00.614
Yeah, he just walked in.

01:08:00.615 --> 01:08:02.283
I'll deal with it.
Fucking piece of shit.

01:08:02.284 --> 01:08:04.285
All right, just call me later.

01:08:04.286 --> 01:08:07.454
Yeah, call me later. Okay, bye.

01:08:07.455 --> 01:08:09.923
She gets
very emotional sometimes.

01:08:09.924 --> 01:08:12.793
Yes. Yeah, I know.
I know she does.

01:08:12.794 --> 01:08:14.294
Your flight was good?

01:08:14.295 --> 01:08:15.228
Oh, it was okay.

01:08:15.229 --> 01:08:16.395
Family's good?

01:08:16.397 --> 01:08:18.899
Uh, my family...

01:08:18.899 --> 01:08:21.033
My family.

01:08:21.035 --> 01:08:23.770
We need to talk, sam.

01:08:23.772 --> 01:08:25.639
I want you to meet me
at the netherworld club.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.774
Around 5:00 a. M.

01:08:27.774 --> 01:08:31.243
I'll come with you
right now, jackie.

01:08:31.245 --> 01:08:33.313
No.

01:08:33.314 --> 01:08:37.818
I'll see you later.
Don't be fucking late.

01:08:44.759 --> 01:08:47.493
Sam, I need you.

01:08:47.495 --> 01:08:49.930
Uh, I'm busy.

01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:52.265
<i>I'm not asking!</i>

01:08:52.267 --> 01:08:54.835
Okay.

01:08:54.836 --> 01:08:56.403
What?

01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:00.541
What do you think?

01:09:00.542 --> 01:09:03.743
Um, it's very
high-quality silk.

01:09:05.913 --> 01:09:08.782
So, you hate it?

01:09:08.783 --> 01:09:10.951
I don't hate it.
I think you look beautiful.

01:09:10.952 --> 01:09:12.118
Okay.

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:15.122
He's so shitty
to people sometimes.

01:09:15.122 --> 01:09:16.423
Who?

01:09:16.424 --> 01:09:17.457
Jackie.

01:09:17.459 --> 01:09:19.827
Oh. Yeah.

01:09:19.828 --> 01:09:21.796
Did he say anything about me?

01:09:23.665 --> 01:09:25.332
Sam? Yeah?

01:09:25.332 --> 01:09:27.334
Do you want to run away
with me?

01:09:27.335 --> 01:09:29.069
What?

01:09:29.069 --> 01:09:32.037
Do you want to run away
with me?

01:09:32.038 --> 01:09:34.040
Yeah. Yeah.

01:09:36.210 --> 01:09:37.845
You do?

01:09:37.845 --> 01:09:40.046
Yeah.

01:09:40.046 --> 01:09:42.948
Do you want to have babies
with me?

01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:45.018
Yes. Yeah. How many children?

01:09:45.019 --> 01:09:46.787
10.

01:09:46.787 --> 01:09:48.287
Okay. That's a lot.

01:09:48.288 --> 01:09:49.957
Or less.

01:09:49.957 --> 01:09:52.893
Where... um, where will they
go to school?

01:09:52.894 --> 01:09:56.430
We could homeschool them.
You can teach them hebrew.

01:09:56.431 --> 01:10:01.435
And I'll teach them
something else really important.

01:10:01.436 --> 01:10:04.271
<i>I could teach you hebrew.
That's really important.</i>

01:10:04.272 --> 01:10:07.107
Okay. Well,
teach me some hebrew.

01:10:07.108 --> 01:10:08.876
You know "shalom"?
Everybody knows "shalom."

01:10:08.877 --> 01:10:11.045
Okay. Um...

01:10:11.046 --> 01:10:13.213
Um... You should
learn a prayer.

01:10:13.214 --> 01:10:16.050
Do you want to learn a prayer?

01:10:19.754 --> 01:10:23.757
I think we look pretty good
together, don't we?

01:10:39.874 --> 01:10:43.376
Sorry. Thank you.

01:10:43.377 --> 01:10:46.046
It's okay.

01:10:46.047 --> 01:10:47.881
Your dress is very nice.

01:10:47.882 --> 01:10:50.350
I'm sorry.
I should have said that.

01:10:50.351 --> 01:10:52.686
You don't want to kiss me?

01:10:52.687 --> 01:10:55.188
And then I should maybe...
Look over my books.

01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:57.190
Why don't you want to kiss me?

01:11:03.665 --> 01:11:06.333
Okay. I'm sorry.

01:11:08.436 --> 01:11:11.105
Thank you.

01:11:14.809 --> 01:11:16.644
Okay. No, no.

01:11:16.645 --> 01:11:18.646
Mm.

01:11:18.647 --> 01:11:19.980
Mm. Slow.

01:11:19.981 --> 01:11:22.983
Okay. Okay.

01:11:22.984 --> 01:11:25.819
Okay. Thank you.

01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:28.822
I'm gonna go to...
I'm gonna go to the other room.

01:11:28.823 --> 01:11:32.159
I'm just gonna see this.

01:12:04.659 --> 01:12:07.594
<i>Shalom.</i>

01:12:07.595 --> 01:12:10.097
You must be mr. Maxim.
I'm rachel.

01:12:10.098 --> 01:12:11.598
Nice to meet you.

01:12:11.599 --> 01:12:12.666
Jackie.

01:12:12.667 --> 01:12:15.169
Gorgeous. Do you guys
need anything?

01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:16.703
Hey, jackie?

01:12:16.704 --> 01:12:18.271
Ladies.

01:12:18.272 --> 01:12:19.673
Let's go.

01:12:19.674 --> 01:12:22.042
Come on. Let's go.

01:12:22.043 --> 01:12:23.510
Am I okay?

01:12:23.511 --> 01:12:25.546
Yeah, you're fine.

01:12:25.547 --> 01:12:28.882
Jackie. Hey, jackie.

01:12:28.883 --> 01:12:31.451
You okay? Hmm?

01:12:31.452 --> 01:12:32.786
Yeah, he's fine,
and she's fine, too.

01:12:32.787 --> 01:12:34.454
Jackie, come on. It's okay.

01:12:34.455 --> 01:12:37.123
Your friends
brought what I want?

01:12:37.124 --> 01:12:39.293
Actually, we only deal with pure m.
D.M.A. You know that, right?

01:12:39.294 --> 01:12:43.296
These kids nowadays... they want
heroin, speed, special k,

01:12:43.297 --> 01:12:46.033
Whatever else
is cut into this shit.

01:12:46.034 --> 01:12:47.701
Sounds like a rave.

01:12:47.702 --> 01:12:49.403
You like to party,
huh, beautiful?

01:12:49.404 --> 01:12:51.371
What about those sniffing dogs?

01:12:51.372 --> 01:12:53.473
They can't smell that shit?

01:12:53.474 --> 01:12:55.642
Hey, chill, please. All right?

01:12:55.643 --> 01:12:58.078
Let's be professional.
Don't embarrass yourself.

01:12:58.079 --> 01:12:59.079
Okay.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.347
So, how do you transport it?

01:13:00.348 --> 01:13:03.917
Sam, please explain to mr. Maxim
how we transport it.

01:13:03.918 --> 01:13:06.820
We use hasidic kids...
young hasidic kids, couriers.

01:13:06.821 --> 01:13:08.221
I've heard of this.

01:13:08.222 --> 01:13:09.823
Ultra-orthodox jews...

01:13:09.824 --> 01:13:12.225
What, do they think
they're smuggling diamonds?

01:13:12.226 --> 01:13:14.928
Uh, actually,
medicine for rich people.

01:13:14.929 --> 01:13:17.497
This is your young
business partner?

01:13:17.498 --> 01:13:18.832
No, no, no, no, no.
He works for me.

01:13:18.833 --> 01:13:20.067
<i>Hey, this is my operation.</i>

01:13:20.068 --> 01:13:21.935
Actually, no, we are.
We are partners.

01:13:21.936 --> 01:13:23.603
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:13:23.604 --> 01:13:25.905
This is funny, ephraim,
and that's not funny.

01:13:27.675 --> 01:13:29.343
Get me a pack of cigarettes, please.
All right.

01:13:29.344 --> 01:13:32.445
Mr. Maxim, I think we should talk numbers.
What do you think?

01:13:32.446 --> 01:13:35.115
Get me a fucking
pack of cigarettes!

01:13:35.116 --> 01:13:40.754
No, no, no. Okay, sam.
Let's talk numbers.

01:13:40.755 --> 01:13:43.123
Now!

01:13:47.628 --> 01:13:49.562
I'm sorry about that,
mr. Maxim.

01:13:49.563 --> 01:13:51.331
You're very aggressive, hmm?

01:13:51.332 --> 01:13:54.167
Excuse me.

01:13:59.307 --> 01:14:01.108
Hey. Hey.

01:14:01.109 --> 01:14:02.476
Are you okay?

01:14:02.477 --> 01:14:04.811
Well, I'm not getting
his fucking cigarettes.

01:14:04.812 --> 01:14:05.912
Okay.

01:14:09.417 --> 01:14:12.419
Do you want to
come back inside, or...

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:14.254
No, I don't.

01:14:14.255 --> 01:14:16.089
I was thinking
we should go to lithuania.

01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:18.291
What do you think?

01:14:18.292 --> 01:14:20.627
Sam, I don't even know
where lithuania is.

01:14:20.628 --> 01:14:22.129
My grandmother lives there,
all right?

01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:23.796
And I never met her.
My dad... she's like us.

01:14:23.797 --> 01:14:24.931
Sam.

01:14:24.932 --> 01:14:27.735
No, I think
we make a cute couple.

01:14:30.538 --> 01:14:35.375
You're just a...
Child, sweetie.

01:14:35.376 --> 01:14:38.545
And how old are you?
How old are you?

01:14:40.015 --> 01:14:41.448
Rachel, he's gonna drop you!

01:14:41.449 --> 01:14:43.283
Yosef told me
jackie is gonna drop you.

01:14:43.284 --> 01:14:44.251
Fuck you! Sorry.

01:14:44.252 --> 01:14:45.452
You don't know
anything about us,

01:14:45.453 --> 01:14:46.620
So why don't you
keep your mouth shut?!

01:14:46.621 --> 01:14:47.955
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

01:14:47.956 --> 01:14:49.356
Yosef told me
jackie is paranoid,

01:14:49.357 --> 01:14:51.024
And if you get smart,
if you get too smart,

01:14:51.025 --> 01:14:52.292
He's gonna drop you. Sorry.

01:14:52.293 --> 01:14:54.761
You know what?
You're the one that's paranoid.

01:14:54.762 --> 01:14:58.598
If you want to come back inside,
fucking come back inside.

01:15:52.253 --> 01:15:53.620
Sir. What?

01:15:53.621 --> 01:15:56.523
Are you jewish? What?

01:15:56.524 --> 01:15:58.391
You are jewish, no?

01:15:58.392 --> 01:16:00.727
Yeah, of course.
Did you put on a tefillin today?

01:16:00.728 --> 01:16:02.528
No, I didn't. I'm traveling.
I forgot.

01:16:02.529 --> 01:16:04.397
Oh, that's...
that's why you look so down.

01:16:04.398 --> 01:16:06.032
You know, we must never forget.

01:16:06.033 --> 01:16:07.701
We have to renew the spot,
you know?

01:16:07.702 --> 01:16:09.035
Yeah. Do a mitzvah.

01:16:09.036 --> 01:16:11.704
Here. Where are you from?

01:16:11.705 --> 01:16:13.740
You're from... you're from new york?
Yeah.

01:16:13.741 --> 01:16:16.610
I have family in, uh,
brooklyn... crown heights.

01:16:16.611 --> 01:16:17.644
Really?

01:16:17.645 --> 01:16:19.279
You've heard
of the rabbi king messiah?

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.747
Yeah, of course.
What are you, a chabad?

01:16:20.748 --> 01:16:21.981
Yes, of course.

01:16:21.982 --> 01:16:24.684
Wherever there is coca-cola,
there is chabad.

01:16:24.685 --> 01:16:26.019
Thank you.

01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:28.688
Put this on.

01:16:30.691 --> 01:16:32.025
Thank you.

01:16:32.026 --> 01:16:33.860
And now we say, "baruch."

01:16:47.241 --> 01:16:49.076
Very cold today.

01:16:49.077 --> 01:16:50.743
Yeah.

01:16:58.152 --> 01:16:59.319
Can I use my hat?

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.820
Yeah, you can use yours.

01:17:00.821 --> 01:17:02.489
Ah. Thank you.

01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:03.490
Say...

01:17:07.628 --> 01:17:09.662
Very good.

01:17:50.872 --> 01:17:52.339
Excuse me.

01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:53.740
Please put... no, it's okay.

01:17:53.741 --> 01:17:55.808
Please put down bags...
both bags. Thank you.

01:17:55.809 --> 01:17:59.545
Your coat is fine.
Put your bags down.

01:17:59.546 --> 01:18:00.446
Uh, yeah.

01:18:01.482 --> 01:18:03.149
Are you traveling alone, sir?

01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:04.183
No.

01:18:04.184 --> 01:18:05.852
So, you're with these people?

01:18:05.853 --> 01:18:07.820
Yes.

01:18:07.821 --> 01:18:10.156
Are you carrying anything
in your bags? No.

01:18:10.157 --> 01:18:11.458
Where do you live?

01:18:11.459 --> 01:18:13.293
Uh...

01:18:13.294 --> 01:18:14.428
Excuse me?

01:18:23.637 --> 01:18:25.805
Sam.

01:18:27.141 --> 01:18:29.476
What the fuck, man?

01:18:29.477 --> 01:18:32.145
What are you doing?! Hey! Hey!

01:18:32.146 --> 01:18:35.648
Sam! What the hell?!

01:18:35.649 --> 01:18:37.584
Sammy!

01:18:43.224 --> 01:18:48.061
Yosef. Sorry. Yosef.

01:18:48.062 --> 01:18:50.097
Sorry. I've got to talk to you.

01:18:50.098 --> 01:18:51.364
Where have you been?

01:18:51.365 --> 01:18:53.700
Yosef, I got to talk to you.
Come on.

01:18:53.701 --> 01:18:55.702
What are you doing?
Come with me. Come with me.

01:19:00.074 --> 01:19:01.608
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:19:01.609 --> 01:19:04.144
All right.
Shh. Come here. Okay.

01:19:04.145 --> 01:19:05.979
What are you doing?

01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:07.914
Yosef, come here.
Yosef, okay, look.

01:19:07.915 --> 01:19:09.149
What are you doing?

01:19:09.150 --> 01:19:10.483
No, you need to stop
and pay attention, all right?

01:19:10.484 --> 01:19:11.951
Listen to me.
We are gonna get in trouble.

01:19:11.952 --> 01:19:13.286
We got to do something.

01:19:13.287 --> 01:19:14.621
My car! You took my car!

01:19:14.622 --> 01:19:15.656
Yosef...

01:19:15.657 --> 01:19:16.990
I've been taking taxis
everywhere.

01:19:16.991 --> 01:19:19.092
Yosef, listen to me.
Listen to me.

01:19:19.093 --> 01:19:21.327
The kids got busted, and we're
all gonna get in trouble,

01:19:21.328 --> 01:19:22.595
And I don't know what to do.

01:19:22.596 --> 01:19:24.297
Who got busted?

01:19:24.298 --> 01:19:25.465
The kids, the kids,
the couriers,

01:19:25.466 --> 01:19:26.800
And this one fucking kid...

01:19:26.801 --> 01:19:28.602
Yosef,
he's gonna tell everybody.

01:19:28.603 --> 01:19:31.271
What do we do, yosef?
What are we fucking gonna do?

01:19:31.272 --> 01:19:32.906
Where's jackie? I don't know.

01:19:32.907 --> 01:19:34.440
He's in...
he's in amsterdam, all right?

01:19:34.441 --> 01:19:35.776
I didn't tell him.
I came to you.

01:19:35.777 --> 01:19:37.443
You have to tell me what to do.

01:19:37.444 --> 01:19:39.479
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.148
Okay. Okay.
Uh, I know what to do.

01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:42.816
Okay. I know what to do.

01:19:42.817 --> 01:19:45.318
Calm down. Jesus christ.

01:19:45.319 --> 01:19:47.287
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

01:19:47.288 --> 01:19:49.088
Uh... What?

01:19:49.089 --> 01:19:51.224
I know what to do. Good.

01:19:51.225 --> 01:19:53.026
Listen to me.
I got a cousin, all right?

01:19:53.027 --> 01:19:55.295
He lives on the west coast.
We're gonna drive.

01:19:55.296 --> 01:19:57.297
We're gonna get in my car.
I mean our car.

01:19:57.298 --> 01:19:58.398
We're gonna drive across
the country, all right?

01:19:58.399 --> 01:19:59.866
We're gonna
stay with my cousin.

01:19:59.867 --> 01:20:02.669
No. Okay? We can hide out
there for as long as we want.

01:20:02.670 --> 01:20:04.004
I've got enough money
for the both of us.

01:20:04.005 --> 01:20:05.305
I got...
that's what we're gonna do.

01:20:05.306 --> 01:20:07.040
That's the best plan,
all right?

01:20:07.041 --> 01:20:10.210
Yeah, listen to me.
The sun, right?

01:20:10.211 --> 01:20:11.544
Beautiful girls. Okay.

01:20:11.545 --> 01:20:13.113
No one's gonna find us.
It's gonna be great.

01:20:13.114 --> 01:20:16.917
Listen to me.
I'm glad you told me.

01:20:16.918 --> 01:20:18.451
I'm glad you told me.
All right.

01:20:18.452 --> 01:20:20.420
Everything's gonna be
all right, sammy gold.

01:20:20.421 --> 01:20:22.121
Everything's gonna be
all right, okay?

01:20:22.122 --> 01:20:24.457
You stay here.
Uh, I'm gonna go get my stuff.

01:20:24.458 --> 01:20:25.658
I'll be right back.

01:20:25.659 --> 01:20:28.761
I'm gonna be right back.

01:20:28.762 --> 01:20:31.731
All right?

01:20:31.732 --> 01:20:34.867
Stay right there!

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:10.269
They heard hashem's voice.

01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:15.875
Moving in the garden
with the wind of day.

01:21:15.876 --> 01:21:20.212
The man and his wife
hid themselves from hashem.

01:21:20.213 --> 01:21:24.016
Among the trees of the garden.

01:21:24.017 --> 01:21:27.687
Hashem called to the man,

01:21:27.688 --> 01:21:32.525
And he said, "where are you?"

01:21:32.526 --> 01:21:36.362
All men must answer this.

01:21:36.363 --> 01:21:39.532
They must know where they stand.

01:21:39.533 --> 01:21:45.037
In relation
to hashem's presence.

01:21:45.038 --> 01:21:49.375
Either you move closer...

01:21:49.376 --> 01:21:51.545
Or further away.

01:23:02.249 --> 01:23:04.918
<i>Shalom aleichem.</i>

01:23:04.919 --> 01:23:07.220
<i>Aleichem shalom.</i>

01:23:10.357 --> 01:23:13.527
It's okay. It's okay.

01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:19.599
I was at your wedding.

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:23.236
It was very nice.

01:23:23.237 --> 01:23:25.438
She's a wonderful woman.
I'm very blessed.

01:23:25.439 --> 01:23:26.773
<i>Baruch hashem.</i>

01:23:26.774 --> 01:23:29.776
<i>Baruch hashem.</i>

01:23:33.948 --> 01:23:36.950
I need help, leon.

01:23:36.951 --> 01:23:39.619
I know.

01:23:42.890 --> 01:23:46.059
I need help.

01:23:56.604 --> 01:23:59.105
Shmuel.

01:24:05.279 --> 01:24:07.280
Shmuel.

01:25:05.339 --> 01:25:07.340
- That's fine.
- That's fine. You're fine.

01:25:07.341 --> 01:25:09.842
It's right up here.

01:25:09.843 --> 01:25:11.677
Guess which costume
your little brother had.

01:25:11.678 --> 01:25:13.346
For his purim celebration.

01:25:13.347 --> 01:25:15.348
Uh, not another goylem?

01:25:15.349 --> 01:25:16.349
No. No?

01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:18.318
Tickle me goylem.
Tickle me goylem?

01:25:18.319 --> 01:25:19.919
What is that? I don't know.

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.988
He called himself
"tickle me goylem,".

01:25:21.989 --> 01:25:24.924
And he was walking around, like,
"I am tickle me goylem!"

01:25:24.925 --> 01:25:27.427
He was tickling everyone.

01:25:27.428 --> 01:25:30.763
It was very funny.

01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:34.501
What's in the book?

01:25:34.502 --> 01:25:37.103
The book?
Uh, it's science fiction.

01:25:37.104 --> 01:25:38.738
It's pretty good. Interesting?

01:25:38.739 --> 01:25:40.073
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I just started it.

01:25:40.074 --> 01:25:41.508
What is it about?

01:25:41.509 --> 01:25:46.513
Uh, these two scientists...
they, uh, they get sent to...
