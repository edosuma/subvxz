03:29.930 --> 03:31.230
Knock,knock. I'm not doing it.

03:31.630 --> 03:34.030
Who's there? Handsome.

03:34.420 --> 03:35.690
Handsome who?

03:35.700 --> 03:37.190
Handsome cereal to me.

03:38.470 --> 03:41.240
Knock,knock. Okay,who's there? 
And this better be funny.

03:41.250 --> 03:43.530
Gorilla. I can't believe 
I'm doing this.

03:43.860 --> 03:44.680
Gorilla who?

03:44.690 --> 03:46.700
Gorilla me a cheese sandwich!

03:46.720 --> 03:47.750
That isn't funny.

03:47.770 --> 03:48.930
Well,I think it is.

03:48.950 --> 03:51.280
Well,it isn't. Well,it is. 
Marie thinks it's funny.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.340
What is going on?

03:52.350 --> 03:53.680
It's like you've 
left me for dead.

03:53.690 --> 03:56.040
Hmm? No. You just 
looked so cozy.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.550
All bundled up there 
in your blankets.

03:58.570 --> 04:00.290
I just thought I'd give you 
a couple of extra minutes.

04:01.290 --> 04:02.830
Cozy? I was freezing.

04:03.450 --> 04:05.730
Yeah? Were-Were you 
guys freezing?

04:07.200 --> 04:08.080
Oh,never mind.

04:08.650 --> 04:10.520
So,is this a bad time 
to talk to you guys

04:10.530 --> 04:11.900
about an idea I had for summer?

04:12.450 --> 04:14.170
JOE: I think this would 
be an excellent time

04:14.730 --> 04:16.750
to talk about an idea that 
you had for summer.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.550
Warm Mommy up.

04:18.950 --> 04:20.640
* Ha,ha, ha,ha. *

04:20.649 --> 04:21.630
What's your idea?

04:22.520 --> 04:24.080
Well,Hannah and Celeste are 
going to Camp Redrock,

04:24.350 --> 04:25.160
and I was thinking maybe

04:25.170 --> 04:26.010
I could go,too.

04:26.900 --> 04:27.710
Camp Redrock?

04:28.530 --> 04:30.070
I don't think I've ever 
heard of Camp Redrock.

04:30.080 --> 04:30.950
Is it around here?

04:30.970 --> 04:32.960
It's a sleep-away 
camp in Flagstaff,

04:32.970 --> 04:35.790
and they have horse riding and
 canoe trips and campfires

04:36.010 --> 04:37.410
and overnight trips.

04:37.750 --> 04:38.980
Sounds expensive.

04:39.420 --> 04:40.590
ARIEL: Thing is, I've never been

04:40.600 --> 04:42.740
to sleep-away camp,and since 
my friends are going,

04:43.310 --> 04:44.840
and this might be 
the last summer

04:44.850 --> 04:46.020
before I'm really too old...

04:46.680 --> 04:48.570
Um,let Mommy and 
me talk about it.

04:49.810 --> 04:51.600
I'll call them up, or I'll 
look them up on-line,

04:51.620 --> 04:52.780
and we'll figure it out.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.580
See where it is, 
how much it costs.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.380
ALLISON: Oh,hey,guys,

04:56.940 --> 04:58.260
come on,we got to 
get cleaned up,

04:58.270 --> 04:59.050
ready for school.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.000
Come on.

05:00.820 --> 05:01.670
Knock,knock.

05:02.560 --> 05:03.610
MARIE: Who's there?

05:04.360 --> 05:05.050
Fig.

05:05.450 --> 05:06.430
Fig who?

05:07.030 --> 05:08.720
ARIEL: Fig my little sister's 
got something broken

05:08.730 --> 05:09.710
inside her brain.

05:09.800 --> 05:10.650
BRIDGETTE: Hey!

05:14.430 --> 05:15.010
So?

05:15.610 --> 05:16.230
Hmm.

05:18.190 --> 05:19.230
So,you're ready for this?

05:20.640 --> 05:21.320
Yeah.

05:21.890 --> 05:23.020
As ready as I'll ever be.

05:26.900 --> 05:27.650
Welcome back,Joe.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.470
Thank you.

05:41.180 --> 05:42.480
Just a little something.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.930
Uh. Hi,Mr. Canty.

05:44.940 --> 05:45.620
Joe.

05:46.870 --> 05:48.750
We've all been,uh, 
thinking about you.

05:48.770 --> 05:49.930
I appreciate that.

05:50.340 --> 05:51.840
If you need anything.

05:51.850 --> 05:52.830
No,I'm fine.

05:54.540 --> 05:55.150
Okay.

05:55.150 --> 05:55.840
Okay.

06:07.050 --> 06:07.870
<i>DEVALOS: Sorry to interrupt</i>

06:07.880 --> 06:08.980
whatever the both 
of you were doing,

06:08.990 --> 06:10.290
but the mayor's office 
just sent these over.

06:11.120 --> 06:11.970
Jennie Heffernan?

06:11.980 --> 06:13.990
DEVALOS: She's a college student, 
but she has been missing

06:14.010 --> 06:15.920
for a day and a half. 
A day and a half?

06:15.920 --> 06:18.540
She's in college-- 
that's not missing; 
that's sobering up.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.530
I'm guessing you're right,

06:20.540 --> 06:22.100
but the mayor's office seems 
to feels otherwise.

06:22.540 --> 06:23.390
The folks she works with

06:23.400 --> 06:26.170
at some off-campus coffee 
place are very concerned.

06:26.180 --> 06:27.960
Apparently,they 
went to the police

06:27.980 --> 06:29.470
and didn't get a whole 
lot of satisfaction.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.660
Then they started calling 
and e-mailing the mayor...

06:31.670 --> 06:32.710
Who started calling you.

06:32.730 --> 06:34.160
So,not only does 
she serve coffee,

06:34.170 --> 06:35.700
but she's also got some juice.

06:35.710 --> 06:37.340
Apparently, Jennie Heffernan is

06:37.350 --> 06:39.530
a Phoenix Mayoral 
Scholarship winner

06:39.540 --> 06:40.970
and a pretty amazing young lady.

06:40.980 --> 06:42.020
She's very studious.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.210
Never misses class, 
never misses work.

06:44.220 --> 06:46.800
Her mother abandoned her when 
she was ten years old.

06:46.810 --> 06:48.630
She was brought up in a 
series of foster homes,

06:48.640 --> 06:50.330
but nonetheless, 
maintained an "A" average

06:50.340 --> 06:52.740
all the way through high school, 
and,as I mentioned,

06:52.760 --> 06:54.280
she's working her way 
through Mesa University

06:54.290 --> 06:55.920
with the help of 
a little scholarship

06:55.930 --> 06:56.900
from the mayor's office.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.870
Now,they know that 
it's premature

06:59.890 --> 07:02.030
to declare her officially missing,

07:02.040 --> 07:04.510
but they asked if I 
could twist some arms,

07:04.530 --> 07:05.790
put some feelers out there.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.790
You just know she's 
in Vegas or Cabo

07:07.800 --> 07:09.590
asking for a twist with that martini.

07:10.010 --> 07:11.310
Well,the sooner 
you can confirm that,

07:11.320 --> 07:12.680
sooner my phone 
will stop ringing.

07:17.340 --> 07:18.190
Joe Dubois.

07:19.010 --> 07:19.950
ALLISON: So,how's it feel?

07:21.100 --> 07:21.980
Oh,it feels good.

07:22.780 --> 07:24.110
Feels like I never went away.

07:24.930 --> 07:26.290
Just getting a lot done.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.290
I bet people

07:27.300 --> 07:29.220
are making a fuss, 
that they're happy to see you.

07:30.530 --> 07:32.180
Oh,they had a little 
banner in my office,

07:32.780 --> 07:34.020
and Mr. Canty came by.

07:35.390 --> 07:36.110
It was nice.

07:36.710 --> 07:37.550
That is nice.

07:39.020 --> 07:40.710
Oh,hey,you didn't happen 
to get a chance

07:40.730 --> 07:43.160
to look up Redrock Camp on 
the Internet,did you?

07:43.760 --> 07:45.740
Honey,I haven't had a chance 
to get to my computer

07:45.750 --> 07:46.730
since I got back.

07:46.740 --> 07:48.750
Yeah,well,I did,and

07:49.320 --> 07:50.980
phew,it's darn expensive.

07:50.990 --> 07:52.520
Oh,yeah? How expensive?

07:53.020 --> 07:54.840
Really expensive.

07:55.370 --> 07:57.810
Okay,well,we'll just have to 
sit down with her and explain

07:58.240 --> 08:00.090
about money,cost of things,

08:00.110 --> 08:01.960
the realities of living 
in a family of five.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.220
I can do that if you like.

08:07.380 --> 08:08.000
Honey?

08:09.600 --> 08:10.900
Honey,can I call you back?

08:10.920 --> 08:11.760
Sure.

08:15.700 --> 08:16.780
This can't be happening.

08:24.850 --> 08:25.930
Stop honking!

08:25.940 --> 08:27.010
I can't see!

08:32.929 --> 08:34.110
"Snow chains"?

09:43.830 --> 09:44.510
Hello?

10:03.060 --> 10:03.980
Hello?!

10:56.740 --> 10:58.300
How in God's name does one

10:58.310 --> 10:59.730
human being do that to another?

11:00.650 --> 11:02.570
That's what everybody around 
here was wondering.

11:03.150 --> 11:04.060
Won't have any answers

11:04.080 --> 11:05.600
for three or four days,though.

11:06.130 --> 11:07.110
I don't understand.

11:08.060 --> 11:10.510
Can't very well perform an 
autopsy on a frozen body.

11:11.270 --> 11:12.180
I recognize that,

11:12.190 --> 11:13.760
but can 't we do something 
to speed this along?

11:13.770 --> 11:15.810
Bring in heat? Melt the ice?

11:15.830 --> 11:17.940
Whoever did this to her 
is almost certainly

11:17.950 --> 11:18.890
still at large.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.560
Hey,all those thoughts 
occurred to me.

11:20.970 --> 11:22.690
The problem is,
 if we heat the body

11:22.700 --> 11:24.160
or even just the ice around it

11:24.180 --> 11:25.480
any potential evidence...

11:25.490 --> 11:27.890
hair follicles, 
fibers from clothing,

11:27.900 --> 11:29.360
skin cells under the nails--

11:29.380 --> 11:31.200
it'll all be contaminated 
by the heat.

11:31.860 --> 11:32.640
And if it isn't...

11:32.660 --> 11:33.790
the lawyers representing

11:33.810 --> 11:35.110
whoever did this are certainly

11:35.120 --> 11:36.620
going to try to 
persuade the judge

11:36.630 --> 11:38.090
or the jury otherwise.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.680
So,what did the banner say?

11:43.250 --> 11:43.970
ARIEL: What banner?

11:45.440 --> 11:48.620
They made a banner for Daddy 
at work to welcome him back.

11:48.630 --> 11:50.580
What's a banner? 
It's a thing

11:50.590 --> 11:52.350
you hang from the ceiling 
with a big message on it.

11:52.820 --> 11:53.530
Cool.

11:54.330 --> 11:55.600
It said, "Welcome Back,Joe."

11:56.000 --> 11:56.740
BRIDGETTE: Wow.

11:56.760 --> 11:58.540
So... did they have a party?

11:59.300 --> 12:00.050
No party.

12:00.070 --> 12:01.490
But everyone was very nice.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.520
They said they missed me

12:03.530 --> 12:04.700
and said they were
 happy to see me.

12:05.620 --> 12:07.280
Mostly they just 
let me do my work.

12:07.810 --> 12:08.660
Catch up.

12:08.670 --> 12:09.740
Left me alone.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.390
Um... I know Mom was 
really busy and...

12:15.400 --> 12:17.370
I know you were busy with 
catching up,but...

12:17.780 --> 12:19.790
did either of you get a 
chance to look up Redrock?

12:20.200 --> 12:21.180
JOE: Yeah,I think Mom did

12:21.710 --> 12:22.810
when she was at 
work and I looked

12:22.830 --> 12:24.160
on the Web site 
just before dinner.

12:25.050 --> 12:25.760
What'd you think?

12:25.780 --> 12:26.780
Pretty amazing,huh?

12:27.540 --> 12:28.970
Well,it certainly was amazing.

12:30.510 --> 12:31.490
Sweetie,you and I need

12:31.500 --> 12:32.470
to talk after dinner.

12:33.390 --> 12:34.080
Okay.

12:34.090 --> 12:35.780
It's just I was talking 
to Celeste today

12:35.790 --> 12:37.580
and she said that the group 
that she and Hannah are in

12:37.880 --> 12:39.990
is filling up pretty 
fast and I just...

12:40.780 --> 12:41.730
don't want to miss it.

12:41.740 --> 12:42.360
That's all.

12:48.150 --> 12:48.840
Hey.

12:49.530 --> 12:50.310
Is this a good time?

12:50.880 --> 12:52.470
Sure. Whatever.

12:56.410 --> 12:57.420
I know what you're going to say.

12:58.830 --> 13:00.550
You're going to say 
it's just too expensive.

13:01.120 --> 13:01.930
Ariel...

13:02.300 --> 13:04.340
I mean Hannah's parents aren't 
rich and she's going.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.690
Yeah,but we don't know 
what her situation is.

13:06.710 --> 13:07.710
We don't know who's paying.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.230
Maybe her grandma and 
grandpa are helping out.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.910
Maybe her parents feel 
differently about it.

13:14.270 --> 13:15.610
I mean she's an only child.

13:15.620 --> 13:16.950
Maybe they feel that this is an,

13:16.960 --> 13:19.130
an important experience 
for her to have

13:19.560 --> 13:21.020
with other girls this summer.

13:21.420 --> 13:22.110
Great.

13:22.130 --> 13:23.000
Lucky me.

13:23.820 --> 13:25.580
Because I have Bridgette 
and Marie for sisters

13:25.590 --> 13:26.700
I don't get to go to camp.

13:26.710 --> 13:29.210
You know this isn't about 
Bridgette and Marie.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.530
Nobody is against 
you going to camp.

13:32.740 --> 13:33.980
But this place works out

13:33.990 --> 13:35.840
at over thousand dollars a week.

13:36.860 --> 13:38.160
And that's before we get you there

13:38.180 --> 13:40.130
and we buy you the stuff 
that you need to bring.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.070
And I'm sorry,honey,but 
that is a lot of money.

13:43.340 --> 13:44.670
Yeah,well, I don't think so.

13:45.470 --> 13:47.610
Well,I don't think that you 
are in a position to know.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.090
Why?

13:49.100 --> 13:50.340
Because I don't have a job?

13:50.900 --> 13:52.720
I'm 14,Dad.

13:52.740 --> 13:53.910
I know that.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.350
And that is my point.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.960
This is something that Mom 
and Dad need to decide

13:58.980 --> 14:02.320
because we do know how hard it 
is to make and save money.

14:02.790 --> 14:03.850
Because there have been times

14:03.860 --> 14:04.480
in our lives... 
But I don't get that.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.120
when we haven't had enough 
You work and Mom works

14:06.140 --> 14:07.120
and you both work

14:07.130 --> 14:08.010
for an emergency situation...

14:08.020 --> 14:08.860
and you're gonna make money

14:08.870 --> 14:10.170
and continue to 
make lots of money.

14:10.180 --> 14:10.890
No!

14:10.910 --> 14:12.850
You don't know that.

14:15.030 --> 14:16.880
I know you're 14.

14:16.900 --> 14:19.170
And you think that 
you know everything...

14:20.090 --> 14:21.980
about us,about the world.

14:22.510 --> 14:23.550
But you don't.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.240
It could all change tomorrow.

14:29.420 --> 14:30.340
You don't know.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.600
Everything's locked.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.710
Thermostat,double-checked.

15:00.050 --> 15:02.130
Oldest daughter knows 
everything there is to know

15:02.130 --> 15:03.140
about everything.

15:06.110 --> 15:07.740
I take it the camp talk

15:07.750 --> 15:09.210
didn't go well. Well....

15:09.220 --> 15:11.140
we knew that she wasn't going 
to be happy about it.

15:12.580 --> 15:13.820
But she was so...

15:15.230 --> 15:17.500
blithe about the money,

15:18.750 --> 15:20.080
blithe about my job,

15:20.420 --> 15:21.690
blithe about the future.

15:24.720 --> 15:25.440
You know,

15:25.450 --> 15:28.020
it's hard being 
surrounded by people

15:29.300 --> 15:31.510
who are so certain they know 
what's happening next,

15:31.910 --> 15:32.830
when you don't.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.380
I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.

15:36.330 --> 15:38.380
I'm talking about the 
critical assumptions

15:38.390 --> 15:40.770
that we all make as we 
go through our lives.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.180
"Daddy will always have a job.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.400
"Daddy will always have money.

15:44.410 --> 15:45.780
Daddy will always be here."

15:46.310 --> 15:47.150
She doesn't know that.

15:47.170 --> 15:48.040
You don't know that.

15:50.160 --> 15:53.120
Yeah,well,you're not planning 
on going anywhere,are you?

15:53.940 --> 15:55.180
We have this contract--

15:55.870 --> 15:57.140
all of us on earth--

15:59.140 --> 16:00.370
that everyone will behave,

16:01.420 --> 16:03.090
that everyone will be reasonable...

16:04.260 --> 16:05.240
and rational...

16:06.880 --> 16:09.580
that we will all take turns 
at a four-way stop sign;

16:10.140 --> 16:12.090
that we won't play loud music

16:12.490 --> 16:14.310
when the rest of the 
block is asleep...

16:15.530 --> 16:18.030
that no one will 
bring a gun to work.

16:39.480 --> 16:40.290
Hey.

16:56.310 --> 16:57.000
I know.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.930
2:45 in the morning.

16:59.630 --> 17:00.570
I hope I didn't wake you.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.410
Just wanted to make sure 
that when I came back,

17:03.420 --> 17:04.589
we'd be alone.

17:09.770 --> 17:10.579
Did you miss me?

17:18.579 --> 17:20.540
No!

17:28.820 --> 17:30.740
You just think of all 
the good times we had.

17:35.570 --> 17:36.710
Calm down,Darling.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.930
I know it's cold in there.

17:44.570 --> 17:45.340
Here we go.

17:45.780 --> 17:47.050
This should speed things along.

17:58.790 --> 18:00.190
Lee? I'm sorry to wake you...

18:00.210 --> 18:02.060
I think I just saw Jennie 
Heffernan's killer.

18:02.950 --> 18:03.770
That's all right.

18:03.780 --> 18:05.170
I haven't actually
 been to bed yet,

18:05.190 --> 18:06.200
and oddly enough,

18:06.210 --> 18:08.290
I'm about to see Jennie 
Heffernan's killer myself.

18:09.370 --> 18:10.280
Excuse me?

18:10.650 --> 18:11.890
I'm down here at the morgue.

18:12.220 --> 18:13.570
Son of a bitch saved us all

18:34.870 --> 18:14.850
a lot of trouble and 
killed himself la£¿£¿

18:17.850 --> 18:20.320
???If the Idol is supposed 
to be American

18:20.330 --> 18:21.790
then how come they have

18:21.800 --> 18:23.000
that British guy do 
all the talking?

18:23.860 --> 18:25.160
That's a good question,Bridge.

18:25.860 --> 18:26.670
And how come you have

18:26.690 --> 18:28.630
to wait till after 
the show to vote?

18:29.070 --> 18:31.570
Don't they know that kids have 
to go to bed after the show?

18:32.140 --> 18:33.730
I think they're afraid 
of what would happen

18:33.750 --> 18:34.880
if kids got to vote.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.290
ALLISON: I think you might 
have something there,Bridge.

18:38.300 --> 18:39.730
Could I eat my toast in my room?

18:40.200 --> 18:41.020
No.

18:42.130 --> 18:43.530
I'm eating my toast in my room.

18:46.530 --> 18:48.220
Yeah,it's nice to see you,too.

18:49.510 --> 18:51.000
Is something going on?

18:51.990 --> 18:53.230
Why'd you let me sleep?

18:53.240 --> 18:54.090
To be mean.

18:54.110 --> 18:56.740
It was fun watching you lay 
there,get some rest.

18:56.750 --> 18:57.890
Your soul at peace.

18:59.590 --> 19:00.670
God,I'm evil.

19:01.690 --> 19:03.060
This family is weird.

19:03.070 --> 19:05.930
Can me and Marie go get dressed?

19:06.400 --> 19:07.150
I don't know?

19:07.160 --> 19:08.660
Can you and Marie go get dressed?

19:09.390 --> 19:10.300
Yeah,honey,go.

19:10.310 --> 19:11.220
Go get dressed.

19:18.830 --> 19:19.840
Hey,Mr. Happy?

19:19.860 --> 19:20.740
You wanna talk?

19:21.270 --> 19:22.510
Why'd you let me sleep?

19:23.360 --> 19:25.280
Well,I was already up.

19:25.620 --> 19:26.610
I've been up since 4:00.

19:26.620 --> 19:27.600
I couldn't go back to sleep.

19:27.610 --> 19:29.440
So,I thought,hey, 
why don't I make coffee.

19:29.460 --> 19:30.920
Why don't I take 
care of the girls.

19:31.480 --> 19:34.070
Give my favorite grump 
an 15 extra minutes

19:34.070 --> 19:35.470
and you can thank me later.

19:36.420 --> 19:37.300
Why are you up?

19:37.310 --> 19:39.480
Well,this will 
shock and amaze you.

19:39.750 --> 19:40.570
I had a dream.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.250
I saw Jennie Heffernan's killer in it.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.760
Mmm,yeah,I'm just reading about him.

19:46.780 --> 19:49.350
Yeah,well,it turns out my 
dream was all for nothing.

19:50.760 --> 19:51.540
They caught the guy.

19:51.880 --> 19:52.990
He killed himself.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.790
So,case is closed.

19:54.800 --> 19:55.780
I'm still up.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.160
It's his fault,right?

19:58.880 --> 19:59.620
Wait a second.

19:59.630 --> 20:00.860
That's not him.

20:01.650 --> 20:02.800
<i>SCANLON: I don't know what 
to tell you, Allison.</i>

20:02.820 --> 20:04.310
It doesn't get much 
neater than this.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.880
The house where you 
discovered the body

20:05.900 --> 20:07.750
was owned by this 
Brian Barbera fellow

20:07.760 --> 20:09.810
who wasn't living there, 
but was doing work on it.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.490
It turns out he and Jennie 
were seeing each other.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.830
And you're sure 
he killed Jennie?

20:14.430 --> 20:16.440
He left behind a juicy suicide 
note telling us

20:16.460 --> 20:18.730
where to find the body and 
exactly how he did it.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.790
Guess he didn't figure 
we'd find her first.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.530
They found him in a pool 
of his own vomit.

20:29.330 --> 20:30.460
The medical examiner said

20:30.480 --> 20:32.850
his stomach was full of cyanide salt.

20:33.670 --> 20:35.820
He just so doesn't look like 
the man in my dream.

20:36.870 --> 20:38.010
Well,don't feel bad.

20:38.510 --> 20:40.010
I guess he didn't turn 
out to be the man

20:40.020 --> 20:40.930
of her dreams either.

20:50.070 --> 20:50.950
Where's Mom?

20:50.960 --> 20:52.220
She's taking a bath.

20:52.920 --> 20:53.910
Why? You need help 
with your homework

20:53.920 --> 20:54.760
or something?

20:55.750 --> 20:57.580
You said the reason I couldn't 
go to Camp Redrock

20:57.590 --> 20:59.570
was because it was too 
expensive,right?

20:59.580 --> 21:01.230
Right. Well,what if 
I paid for it?

21:02.670 --> 21:03.270
Ariel...

21:03.610 --> 21:05.170
What? Is that such 
a hard question?

21:05.630 --> 21:08.270
Okay,look,I know you're 
mad at me about this,

21:09.030 --> 21:10.000
but you need to know something.

21:10.010 --> 21:11.280
I'm starting to get mad at you.

21:13.180 --> 21:14.620
"No" is something that 
you're going to hear

21:14.630 --> 21:15.930
from time to time in your life

21:15.940 --> 21:17.050
and the fact that 
you can't seem

21:17.060 --> 21:19.600
to accept that concerns me a lot.

21:20.680 --> 21:21.460
What's that?

21:22.870 --> 21:24.010
It's the money for camp.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.090
I found it.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.010
This is a passbook...

21:34.380 --> 21:36.230
for an account that your 
grandparents set up for you

21:36.250 --> 21:37.120
when you were born.

21:37.580 --> 21:38.500
Where'd you get this?

21:38.510 --> 21:39.840
What difference does it make?

21:40.200 --> 21:41.670
It has my name is on it. 
It's mine.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.430
This was in my drawer.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.500
What were you doing going 
through my things?

21:45.520 --> 21:46.950
I didn't go through your things.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.710
I knew right where it was, 
and I knew it was mine.

21:48.730 --> 21:50.090
So I went in your room 
and I got it.

21:50.100 --> 21:50.910
That's all.

21:50.920 --> 21:52.810
It has my name on it, 
and it's my money.

21:52.820 --> 21:54.220
There's almost $8,000

21:54.230 --> 21:55.690
in there and I'm going 
to use it for camp.

21:56.390 --> 21:58.530
It may have your name on it, 
but it is not your money.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.270
Not until you turn 18.

22:01.450 --> 22:02.910
And the fact that it 
has your name on it

22:02.930 --> 22:05.490
is no excuse for you going 
through my drawer to get it.

22:06.770 --> 22:08.200
How did you even
 know where it was?

22:08.960 --> 22:10.260
I know lots of things,Dad.

22:10.720 --> 22:11.310
Well,

22:11.320 --> 22:12.360
no,you don't.

22:12.370 --> 22:14.450
You don't know nearly as much 
as you think you do.

22:14.950 --> 22:16.120
That money is for college.

22:16.530 --> 22:17.340
Your grandparents

22:17.350 --> 22:19.750
gave you that money for 
college,not for camp.

22:23.790 --> 22:24.770
So that's it?

22:24.790 --> 22:26.640
It's just "no" even though 
I have the money?

22:27.850 --> 22:30.680
Yes,it's "no," and you 
don't have the money,

22:31.280 --> 22:32.650
and you can't just 
go into my room

22:32.660 --> 22:33.960
and take things without asking.

22:35.240 --> 22:35.960
All right.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.240
Is that everything?

22:40.730 --> 22:42.000
It doesn't matter 
where you put it.

22:42.010 --> 22:43.410
I'll still know where it is.

22:52.540 --> 22:53.290
That's okay.

22:53.300 --> 22:54.960
You don't need a passport 
to get in this bedroom.

22:54.970 --> 22:56.260
Your driver's license will do.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.190
No,it's not a passport; 
it's a passbook,

22:58.630 --> 23:00.480
and it was in my drawer 
under a lot of socks,

23:00.490 --> 23:02.470
and Ariel took it without 
my permission

23:02.480 --> 23:03.920
to show me that she had the money

23:03.930 --> 23:05.100
to pay for camp.

23:05.110 --> 23:06.960
Whoo,this kid's rich.

23:06.970 --> 23:07.880
That's not funny.

23:07.900 --> 23:10.100
This is her college 
money from my parents.

23:10.890 --> 23:11.610
Well,calm down.

23:11.620 --> 23:12.620
I know what it is.

23:13.870 --> 23:16.090
We both know she can't get 
any money out of the bank

23:16.100 --> 23:17.180
without one of us.

23:17.190 --> 23:17.990
And you know what?

23:18.000 --> 23:18.970
She knows it,too.

23:19.700 --> 23:20.970
She's just mad.

23:21.370 --> 23:22.990
She's mad that she seems to have

23:23.010 --> 23:24.500
so little control over her life.

23:24.510 --> 23:27.870
She's mad that we seem to have 
so much control over her life.

23:29.110 --> 23:30.220
So just come on. Relax.

23:30.590 --> 23:31.430
Let's go to bed.

23:32.810 --> 23:34.320
You know, in a couple of days,

23:34.330 --> 23:35.490
everything will be back to normal.

23:35.500 --> 23:36.310
She'll be fine.

23:40.350 --> 23:42.660
No,I-I don't think I feel like 
coming to bed right now.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.530
You always feel like coming to bed.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.180
Is everything okay at work?

23:53.680 --> 23:54.520
Everything's fine.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.160
Is everything okay with us?

23:57.180 --> 23:58.440
Everything is fine.

24:00.140 --> 24:02.550
So all of this angst 
is about Ariel?

24:03.180 --> 24:03.960
What are you trying to say?

24:04.490 --> 24:06.670
I'm saying something seems wrong.

24:07.790 --> 24:09.520
Everything is so serious.

24:10.700 --> 24:11.670
You don't seem happy.

24:15.260 --> 24:17.790
You know,this is the first time 
I can ever remember

24:17.810 --> 24:20.040
you forgetting to ask 
me how my day was.

24:20.060 --> 24:21.490
I didn't forget. I already know.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.000
You had a dream. You told someone.

24:23.010 --> 24:25.840
They didn't believe you,but it 
all worked out in the end.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.030
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just... 
I'm mad.

24:33.050 --> 24:34.120
I'm mad that I seem to have

24:34.130 --> 24:35.980
so little control over my own life.

24:38.570 --> 24:39.640
I guess I'll watch TV.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.190
Bull's-eye.

24:56.170 --> 24:57.280
Bull's-eye.

25:33.470 --> 25:34.280
Bull's-eye.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.080
MARIE: You're laying 
on my Mr. Snookie.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.300
Must have fallen asleep watching TV.

26:05.410 --> 26:06.420
Get ready for work.

26:11.360 --> 26:12.050
Diamonds?

26:12.320 --> 26:13.750
She finds them in this,t
his place,

26:13.760 --> 26:16.290
this storage unit where I first 
saw her being killed.

26:16.310 --> 26:17.710
Storage unit?

26:17.730 --> 26:18.810
W-What are you talking about?

26:18.820 --> 26:20.020
That's what I was 
trying to tell you.

26:20.940 --> 26:22.410
The place where I saw 
her being killed

26:22.420 --> 26:24.270
looks nothing like the place 
where I found her body,

26:24.280 --> 26:27.600
and the man that I, 
I saw killing her

26:27.610 --> 26:28.710
is not the same man

26:29.270 --> 26:31.560
who committed suicide 
and left a confession.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.470
Now I'm dreaming about 
these diamonds.

26:37.470 --> 26:39.350
This dead girl is 
sending me messages

26:39.370 --> 26:40.860
and I can't make 
any sense of them.

26:42.470 --> 26:44.510
I feel like I have to get a 
better sense of who she is,

26:44.530 --> 26:47.510
maybe talk to her friends 
or see where she lived.

26:47.920 --> 26:49.770
Allison,this is a closed case.

26:49.780 --> 26:50.590
Well,apparently

26:50.610 --> 26:52.810
not to the victim or I'd be 
sleeping a whole lot better.

26:53.480 --> 26:54.300
Well,the friends thing

26:54.310 --> 26:56.390
isn't something that we can 
make happen quickly.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.620
Maybe I can get you 
into her apartment.

26:59.640 --> 27:01.260
Would you mind going by yourself?

27:01.320 --> 27:02.460
I'm not sure that I can afford

27:02.470 --> 27:04.060
to assign a detective 
to something that,

27:04.070 --> 27:05.340
at least from a legal standpoint,

27:05.350 --> 27:06.450
has already been resolved.

27:06.460 --> 27:07.630
Okay,I'm fine with that.

27:08.750 --> 27:11.090
Yeah,Jennie was a very nice girl.

27:11.110 --> 27:13.980
She always paid her rent on time.

27:15.070 --> 27:15.850
When the police told me

27:15.850 --> 27:17.950
what happened, I was horrified.

27:19.290 --> 27:21.240
I haven't touched the place yet.

27:21.250 --> 27:22.320
They told me not to.

27:24.030 --> 27:26.040
Uh... there you go.

27:27.230 --> 27:28.430
Now it won't lock on you.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.770
Thank you. I won't be long.

27:49.830 --> 27:50.510
Hmm.

28:42.790 --> 28:43.740
Oh.

28:53.350 --> 28:54.100
Jennie.

28:57.100 --> 28:59.800
I know this sounds strange, 
but I can actually see you.

29:03.520 --> 29:04.690
I'm so sorry.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.340
All that you've been through.

29:08.490 --> 29:10.350
No one's life should end that way.

29:12.630 --> 29:13.610
Who did this to you?

29:14.690 --> 29:15.670
Was it Brian?

29:16.420 --> 29:17.310
Why?

29:18.620 --> 29:20.010
I want to bring you peace.

29:20.910 --> 29:22.560
I want to bring you justice.

29:23.410 --> 29:25.680
???

29:38.070 --> 29:38.780
I'm confused.

29:38.790 --> 29:41.070
You say the ghost of Jennie 
Heffernan did this to you?

29:41.080 --> 29:43.160
Impressive,ghost packs 
a hell of a wallop.

29:43.530 --> 29:46.030
<i>I said I thought it was the 
ghost of Jennie Heffernan.</i>

29:46.050 --> 29:47.220
Obviously,I was mistaken.

29:48.070 --> 29:49.700
She must have been hiding 
in here the whole time--

29:49.710 --> 29:51.150
I don't know-- maybe in that closet.

29:51.650 --> 29:52.490
She must have come out

29:52.510 --> 29:53.870
when she heard me leave 
the first time.

29:54.270 --> 29:55.890
Which begs the question: 
if Jennie is alive

29:55.910 --> 29:57.440
and well enough to 
assault you,then...

29:57.450 --> 29:59.400
Then who are we waiting to 
defrost at the morgue?

29:59.820 --> 30:00.680
Well,what was she doing here?

30:00.690 --> 30:01.760
What was she looking for?

30:03.560 --> 30:05.450
Hey,w-will you pass me my purse?

30:07.970 --> 30:08.760
Thanks.

30:10.260 --> 30:11.700
I wonder if she was 
looking for this.

30:12.170 --> 30:12.950
SCANLON: What's that?

30:12.970 --> 30:13.910
I'm hoping it's the keys

30:13.930 --> 30:16.200
to a storage space I've 
been dreaming about.

30:20.760 --> 30:21.380
Hello?

30:21.390 --> 30:24.150
MAN Mrs. Dubois, 
my name is Marcus Canty.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.710
I work with your husband. 
Excuse me.

30:26.340 --> 30:28.030
Is this a bad time?

30:28.040 --> 30:29.990
Would it be better if
 I called you back?

30:30.430 --> 30:32.120
No,this is an excellent time.

30:32.750 --> 30:34.310
I'm having an excellent day.

30:35.040 --> 30:37.480
This has to do with your 
husband,Mrs. Dubois.

30:37.880 --> 30:38.630
Is he all right?

30:39.030 --> 30:41.210
To be perfectly honest, 
I'm not sure.

30:41.220 --> 30:42.780
I mean,he's here
 and he's fine,

30:42.790 --> 30:44.290
but since he's come 
back to work,

30:44.310 --> 30:46.420
he hasn't been attending 
any meetings;

30:46.430 --> 30:48.240
he hasn't been making 
any phone calls;

30:48.840 --> 30:51.180
and,uh, I talked to our IT guys

30:51.190 --> 30:54.440
and even though he switches on
 his computer in the mornings,

30:54.450 --> 30:56.990
he doesn't seem to be signing 
on to the company server.

30:57.980 --> 31:00.940
Near as I can tell, he,uh,
sits in his office

31:00.950 --> 31:03.880
with his door locked all day 
and does God knows what.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.200
I feel very strongly

31:06.210 --> 31:08.810
that perhaps we had him come 
back to work too soon.

31:10.030 --> 31:13.110
I think perhaps he should 
see a professional,

31:13.130 --> 31:15.500
a counselor or a therapist.

31:17.300 --> 31:18.960
I can hear that I've 
caught you at work.

31:18.980 --> 31:20.920
No,I'm gr... I'm very 
grateful for your call

31:20.940 --> 31:24.640
and I'm thinking whatever you're 
thinking... i-it seems right.

31:29.470 --> 31:30.220
ALLISON: Hiya.

31:30.230 --> 31:30.940
Hi.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.090
What you doing?

31:32.100 --> 31:34.180
Just looking myself 
up on the Internet.

31:35.040 --> 31:36.540
It's kind of frustrating, 
actually.

31:36.560 --> 31:37.790
Apparently,
I don't exist,

31:38.410 --> 31:39.910
although there is a 
guy with my name

31:39.920 --> 31:41.390
who's all the rage in gay porn.

31:42.410 --> 31:43.420
You doing anything interesting?

31:43.930 --> 31:46.950
Nope,sitting in a car, 
driving across town with Lee,

31:48.200 --> 31:49.340
talking to my husband.

31:52.500 --> 31:53.190
Love you.

31:53.590 --> 31:54.340
Love you.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.410
Are you sure we shouldn't 
stop by an emergency room,

32:00.420 --> 32:01.850
get a proper X- ray or something?

32:02.420 --> 32:05.240
Nah,I'm fine. It's just my head.

32:05.610 --> 32:06.910
There's nothing in there anyway.

32:11.210 --> 32:12.350
Yeah,I know this girl.

32:13.310 --> 32:15.620
I helped her load a freezer 
out of here last week.

32:15.630 --> 32:17.130
She was Brian's girlfriend.

32:18.110 --> 32:19.190
I mean,you know that.

32:19.210 --> 32:20.310
It was in the papers.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.080
She used to come around here a lot.

32:22.750 --> 32:25.150
So this is definitely Brian 
Barbera's storage unit?

32:25.620 --> 32:27.180
Has been ever since I worked here.

32:27.190 --> 32:29.660
Kid came in like clockwork, 
every month to pay the rent.

32:30.490 --> 32:31.920
Did you actually 
want to go inside?

32:32.520 --> 32:34.470
If you do,there's something 
I have to ask you to sign.

32:36.170 --> 32:37.370
Well,that's strange.

32:38.580 --> 32:39.330
I take it back.

32:39.350 --> 32:42.560
I guess Brian Barbera isn't 
the actual tenant of record

32:42.570 --> 32:43.610
for this unit.

32:43.630 --> 32:44.700
Then who was?

32:45.060 --> 32:46.950
Somebody named Peter Barbera.

32:47.620 --> 32:48.600
A brother maybe.

32:48.970 --> 32:50.210
I don't think I've ever met him.

32:52.630 --> 32:53.670
<i>I'm worried about you.</i>

32:56.510 --> 32:57.690
Your boss called.

32:59.740 --> 33:01.820
They said they might 
want you to see someone.

33:03.530 --> 33:04.570
Talk to someone.

33:07.570 --> 33:09.160
I think it's a pretty good idea.

33:20.330 --> 33:21.130
I'll get it.

33:27.480 --> 33:28.040
Hello?

33:28.380 --> 33:29.360
SCANLON: He's not the brother.

33:29.380 --> 33:30.120
He's the father.

33:30.520 --> 33:31.300
Excuse me?

33:31.800 --> 33:33.980
Peter Barbera,the man who 
rents that storage unit--

33:34.000 --> 33:36.240
he's the father,and he's been 
in prison almost eight years.

33:36.710 --> 33:37.520
Okay.

33:37.860 --> 33:38.770
Great story,too.

33:38.780 --> 33:40.730
Got pulled over for a suspected DUI

33:40.750 --> 33:42.890
and actually got into 
it with the officer.

33:42.910 --> 33:43.690
I mean,big time:

33:43.700 --> 33:45.390
blows to the head, 
then a high-speed chase.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.680
I mean,this guy's desperate
 not to get arrested.

33:48.280 --> 33:49.550
Turns out, it's his third strike.

33:49.960 --> 33:51.840
Then,no sooner do they 
get him in the joint,

33:51.860 --> 33:53.150
then he's picked 
out of a line-up

33:53.170 --> 33:54.460
for a local diamond heist.

33:56.420 --> 33:57.380
Have I got your attention?

33:58.290 --> 34:00.050
They couldn't make it stick, 
never found the diamonds,

34:00.070 --> 34:02.240
but on the surveillance 
video of the heist,

34:02.260 --> 34:03.650
there is a man and a woman,

34:04.280 --> 34:05.580
a woman with blond hair.

34:06.150 --> 34:07.430
Your boss and I are 
setting up a visit

34:07.440 --> 34:10.100
at Arizona Correctional with 
Mr. Barbera for tomorrow.

34:10.670 --> 34:11.580
Care to join us?

34:16.560 --> 34:18.230
Mr. Barbera, I'm Manuel Devalos,

34:18.630 --> 34:20.090
District Attorney, 
the city of Phoenix.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.040
These are my colleagues...

34:21.060 --> 34:22.090
I really don't care.

34:24.210 --> 34:25.420
They buried my son today.

34:26.989 --> 34:29.100
You'd think they'd give 
a guy a day to mourn.

34:31.610 --> 34:32.850
This should speed things along.

34:34.010 --> 34:35.500
We're terribly sorry,
 Mr. Barbera.

34:35.510 --> 34:36.909
Actually,he's the 
reason we're here.

34:40.739 --> 34:42.070
How much do you know 
about your son's death?

34:44.580 --> 34:45.590
He killed some girl.

34:47.230 --> 34:48.340
Then he killed himself.

34:50.330 --> 34:52.440
Can I show you a 
picture of this girl?

35:01.550 --> 35:02.430
What'd you say her name was?

35:02.800 --> 35:05.240
Jennie. Jennie Heffernan.

35:05.610 --> 35:06.360
Very interesting girl.

35:06.370 --> 35:09.720
Smart. Very smart,but had 
a very tragic life.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.630
Her mother abandoned her 
when she was quite young.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.720
For a while,her older sister 
Haley tried to raise her,

35:14.730 --> 35:17.850
but then Haley got involved 
with a two-time loser

35:17.870 --> 35:19.940
that liked to stick 
up jewelry stores.

35:20.510 --> 35:22.540
Next thing you know, 
Haley's nowhere to be found,

35:23.560 --> 35:24.760
and Jennie's all alone again.

35:25.420 --> 35:26.690
Then she turned up dead,

35:26.710 --> 35:28.850
and your son confessed 
in a suicide note.

35:30.100 --> 35:31.360
Anyone tell you how 
he killed her?

35:33.360 --> 35:34.890
Bound her up, stuffed 
her in a freezer,

35:34.900 --> 35:35.980
doused her with water.

35:36.740 --> 35:37.590
Pretty tragic,huh?

35:38.410 --> 35:40.430
First the sister disappears.

35:41.320 --> 35:42.390
Then Jennie's killed.

35:42.920 --> 35:44.420
Then we realize that this

35:44.690 --> 35:46.740
freezer wasn't always
 where we found it,

35:46.750 --> 35:47.920
that up until recently,

35:47.930 --> 35:50.400
it was in a storage 
unit you were renting.

35:51.780 --> 35:52.460
Really?

35:52.470 --> 35:53.350
Really.

35:54.660 --> 35:56.660
And that got us to thinking.

35:57.810 --> 36:00.630
What if Jennie's sister 
didn't disappear at all?

36:00.650 --> 36:02.300
What if something far more dire

36:02.610 --> 36:03.520
happened to her?

36:03.860 --> 36:04.800
For that matter,

36:04.820 --> 36:07.030
what if it wasn't Jennie 
in the freezer?

36:08.300 --> 36:10.290
What if your son wasn't 
a killer at all?

36:11.630 --> 36:13.920
SCANLON: You got to wonder what 
we'd find if we tore that place apart.

36:15.330 --> 36:16.700
Think we'd find 
anything valuable?

36:18.660 --> 36:21.160
Think there'd be any,uh-- 
I don't know-- diamonds maybe?

36:21.990 --> 36:23.730
DEVALOS: In a few days,
 we'll be able to positively

36:23.750 --> 36:25.270
identify the woman 
in that freezer.

36:26.590 --> 36:27.700
I've got a very strong hunch

36:27.710 --> 36:29.240
that it's not going to be Jennie,

36:29.840 --> 36:31.080
but maybe her sister Haley,

36:31.710 --> 36:33.110
and when we tie her murder to you,

36:33.120 --> 36:35.750
I intend to seek the 
death penalty,unless

36:35.770 --> 36:37.100
you start telling 
me what you know.

36:41.370 --> 36:42.380
She got away with it.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.470
The perfect murder.

36:47.310 --> 36:49.680
She must have been 
planning it for years,

36:49.700 --> 36:53.600
tracking down Peter 
Barbera's son Brian,

36:54.130 --> 36:55.520
becoming his girlfriend,

36:56.690 --> 36:58.510
getting the key to 
the storage unit...

37:00.240 --> 37:03.170
finding the diamonds 
that her sister died for...

37:05.060 --> 37:07.050
using her own sister's body

37:08.260 --> 37:09.760
to make it look like she was dead

37:09.770 --> 37:11.130
so no one would look for her.

37:13.970 --> 37:16.080
All for those diamonds.

37:28.080 --> 37:28.860
Night.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.470
They almost don't seem real, Haley.

37:40.320 --> 37:41.490
Yeah,they're real,Jen.

37:42.640 --> 37:43.650
And you know what?

37:44.090 --> 37:45.220
These little babies are going

37:45.230 --> 37:46.870
to make all our dreams come true.

37:54.580 --> 37:55.330
Haley,

37:55.700 --> 37:56.420
pick those up.

37:56.920 --> 37:57.660
Give them to me.

37:58.920 --> 37:59.830
I'll be right back.

38:00.520 --> 38:01.560
What are you talking about?

38:01.970 --> 38:03.590
I just got off the 
phone with my fence.

38:04.190 --> 38:05.720
He won't touch 'em 
till they cool down.

38:06.490 --> 38:07.690
Two weeks at least.

38:08.680 --> 38:09.590
I got to hide them.

38:10.710 --> 38:11.460
Hide 'em?

38:12.280 --> 38:13.270
Or run with them?

38:15.550 --> 38:16.460
You want to come with me?

38:17.120 --> 38:18.200
I got the perfect spot.

38:18.660 --> 38:19.570
A real bull's-eye.

38:20.170 --> 38:21.760
A little place where 
I keep my hunting gear.

38:24.570 --> 38:27.200
Yes,as a matter of fact,I do.

38:28.810 --> 38:30.600
Jennie,come on. 
Get up. Let's go.

38:31.450 --> 38:33.070
Peter's got a place 
he needs us to go.

38:33.510 --> 38:34.520
A real bull's-eye.

38:34.530 --> 38:35.830
Whoa,whoa,wait. 
What are you doing?

38:36.490 --> 38:37.770
The kid's in her pajamas.

38:38.170 --> 38:39.310
It's the middle of the night.

38:39.320 --> 38:40.950
This'll take 15 minutes.

38:40.960 --> 38:42.350
Let's just go run over there.

38:42.370 --> 38:43.730
I'll have you back in no time.

38:46.770 --> 38:48.490
Jennie,we're going 
to be right back.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.460
I want you to lock 
the door behind us

38:50.470 --> 38:52.710
and don't open it for 
anyone,okay?

38:52.730 --> 38:53.960
Okay.

38:58.550 --> 38:59.340
What?

39:01.560 --> 39:02.600
Don't worry about them.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.770
I'll keep an eye on the 
diamonds for the both of us.

39:06.490 --> 39:07.440
Are we rich now?

39:07.680 --> 39:08.560
Sure we are.

39:08.570 --> 39:09.810
Soon as we sell these diamonds,

39:10.790 --> 39:12.840
we'll have everything 
and anything we want.

39:13.830 --> 39:15.060
We'll be able to do anything,

39:15.560 --> 39:16.480
go anywhere.

39:17.100 --> 39:18.400
Even Mexico?

39:19.230 --> 39:20.570
Even Mexico.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.150
Be back soon.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.200
Back soon.

40:04.290 --> 40:05.030
Hello?

40:05.920 --> 40:07.000
SCANLON: I'm sorry to 
call you this late,

40:07.010 --> 40:08.090
but I thought you'd
 want to know.

40:09.080 --> 40:10.080
Got a call from Customs.

40:10.100 --> 40:11.330
She's already used her passport.

40:11.770 --> 40:12.610
Mexico.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.750
Based on the partial fingerprint 
we were able to get,

40:15.760 --> 40:17.940
this is definitely 
Haley Heffernan.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.590
Cause of death: suffocation. 
She drowned.

40:21.020 --> 40:21.930
You mentioned on the phone

40:21.950 --> 40:23.410
that in the course 
of your examination

40:23.420 --> 40:25.570
you'd come across 
something unexpected.

40:25.950 --> 40:26.730
Over here.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.160
We found this 
during the autopsy.

40:30.890 --> 40:32.480
When I examined the 
stomach contents

40:32.490 --> 40:33.740
I found a latex balloon.

40:34.110 --> 40:35.310
When I cut the balloon open...

40:36.230 --> 40:37.400
I found these.

40:37.420 --> 40:38.520
Oh,my God.

40:39.120 --> 40:40.870
According to the boys 
in Robbery-Homicide,

40:41.570 --> 40:42.510
they're real.

40:43.530 --> 40:45.130
She swallowed the diamonds.

40:45.690 --> 40:46.720
But if these are 
the real diamonds...

40:46.730 --> 40:47.960
what did Jennie steal?

40:50.540 --> 40:52.010
I don't know where 
you're from,miss,

40:52.640 --> 40:55.760
but here in Tijuana we 
don't take too kindly

40:55.770 --> 40:58.270
to somebody trying to 
pass off fake diamonds.

40:58.290 --> 40:59.330
Fake?

41:00.640 --> 41:02.450
What are you talking about fake? 
They can't be.

41:02.470 --> 41:04.320
Fake. Glass.

41:05.140 --> 41:05.990
Now leave.

41:06.780 --> 41:08.540
Get out of here before 
I call the police.

41:09.590 --> 41:10.830
But they can't be fake.

41:12.360 --> 41:13.530
You don't understand.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.410
I don't have anywhere to go.

41:16.430 --> 41:17.590
I don't have any money.

41:17.830 --> 41:18.660
<i>Policia?</i>

41:19.380 --> 41:21.140
<i>Hay una gringa aqui 
muy suspiciosa.</i>

41:26.640 --> 41:27.290
You okay?

41:30.320 --> 41:31.110
Yeah.

41:32.910 --> 41:33.850
Thanks for asking.

41:35.390 --> 41:36.330
Yeah,I'm fine.

41:38.780 --> 41:41.290
A bunch of things 
I couldn't figure out...

41:42.660 --> 41:43.960
I think make sense.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.860
How about you? Are you okay?

41:51.870 --> 41:53.690
Yeah,actually.

41:55.490 --> 41:57.670
I think for the first 
time in a while...

41:59.760 --> 42:01.380
I feel fine,too.

42:25.550 --> 23:59:59.999
