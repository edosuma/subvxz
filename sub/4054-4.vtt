NARRATOR: Three weeks ago,
a dome crashed on Chester's Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.413
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.461
The dome has tested our limits,

00:11.178 --> 00:14.090
forcing each of us
to confront our own personal demons.

Now, in order to survive,

00:24.608 --> 00:27.520

our most dangerous adversary:

00:28.070 --> 00:30.106
the enemy within.

is worth risking our lives for?

of being their guinea pig.

Twenty-five years ago, a team went on
an archeological exploration to Alaska,

the shards emitted electrical charges
when touched.

Unfortunately,
their excitement was short-lived.

became infected

19:48.729 --> 19:50.344

altered their behavior.

- You're a liar.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.883

early enough,

21:05.431 --> 21:09.015
we believe that we have an opportunity
to reverse it.
