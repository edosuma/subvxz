00:20.123 --> 00:22.058
Megatron? 

00:22.126 --> 00:25.461
It seems you detected the
ancient autobot frequency

00:25.530 --> 00:27.830
precisely because it was unearthed.

00:27.899 --> 00:30.700
Well, our backup
shouldn't be far behind.

00:30.768 --> 00:34.770
Without knowing what the
decepticons have exhumed,

00:34.839 --> 00:37.206
I don not think I am willing to wait.

00:45.415 --> 00:52.888
Show me.
Bring it to me with utmost care.

01:00.498 --> 01:05.901
Megatron.
I cannot allow you to pilfer autobot relics.

01:05.970 --> 01:10.840
Not only are you misinformed,
Optimus, but i would strongly

01:10.908 --> 01:15.778
advise you to lower your weapons
unless you're in the mood for

01:15.847 --> 01:19.749
mutually assured destruction.

01:19.817 --> 01:23.853
- It can't be.
- The Spark extractor.

01:29.704 --> 01:32.968
<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0
~ Addic7ed.com ~ </font></i>

02:16.219 --> 02:18.721
Rather unassuming... 

02:18.790 --> 02:23.592
Yet capable of extracting every
spark within its radius.

02:23.661 --> 02:28.564
And to think that you led me
straight to it, Optimus.

02:28.633 --> 02:31.734
Or should i say Orion Pax did?

02:31.803 --> 02:35.771
You really should have left your
decepticon shield intact ...

02:35.840 --> 02:40.476
for you have no idea how useful your
code-breaking skills proved to be

02:40.545 --> 02:45.815
during our all-too-brief time together.

02:45.883 --> 02:48.818
Soundwave, send the ground bridge.

02:51.723 --> 02:54.757
Engage them!

03:20.250 --> 03:23.853
Bumblebee...
secure the package.

03:42.272 --> 03:43.372
What?!

04:19.043 --> 04:20.642
Loop-de-loop, huh?

04:23.548 --> 04:27.149
You have some brass bearings, Bumblebee.

04:27.218 --> 04:28.651
Optimus.

04:31.722 --> 04:32.354
Here.

04:33.558 --> 04:36.258
The source of the ancient
frequency we detected.

04:36.327 --> 04:38.093
An Iacon homing beacon.

04:38.162 --> 04:41.397
What's an autobot locator
doing on that?

04:41.465 --> 04:45.434
The Class-A Decepticon
weapons confiscated during the war

04:45.503 --> 04:48.771
were sealed within the
vaults below Iacon.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.774
Where you once worked as an archivist?

04:51.843 --> 04:56.145
Iacon was both a cultural
center and a stronghold ... which

04:56.214 --> 05:00.282
Megatron raided when autobot
troops were at their nadir.

05:00.351 --> 05:04.620
It stands to reason that in
anticipation of Iacon being

05:04.689 --> 05:08.724
overrun by enemy forces, these
weapons were jettisoned

05:08.793 --> 05:12.194
off-world to keep them far from
decepticon reach.

05:12.263 --> 05:15.931
Clearly, the beacon was added
as a safety measure should the

05:16.000 --> 05:18.734
weapons ever be found by the
undesired party.

05:18.803 --> 05:22.504
Well, thanks to
our hotshot stunt driver, this

05:22.573 --> 05:24.039
one's going in our vault.

05:24.108 --> 05:27.977
Do you think this is the only
intel you supplied to Megatron?

05:28.045 --> 05:33.148
Arcee, you are right to ask,
and i am afraid i...

05:33.217 --> 05:34.950
do not remember.

05:35.019 --> 05:36.619
Optimus.

05:36.687 --> 05:40.089
Megatron clearly took advantage
of your amnesia, but for all we

05:40.157 --> 05:42.758
know, this spark extractor is
the extent of it.

05:42.827 --> 05:45.928
Have you stopped to consider
that he might have suggested

05:45.997 --> 05:51.100
otherwise merely to plague your
thoughts?

05:51.168 --> 05:54.103
The spark extractor was in my grasp!

05:54.171 --> 05:56.338
I should have removed more than

05:56.407 --> 06:01.810
that scout's voice box when i
had the chance!

06:03.881 --> 06:05.748
Indeed, Soundwave.

06:05.816 --> 06:09.885
We possess two more sets of
coordinates which Orion

06:09.954 --> 06:12.922
decrypted before
departing our ranks.

06:12.990 --> 06:20.262
Let us see what other long-lost
treasures we might be reunited with.

06:30.308 --> 06:32.441
<i>Yeah, I just picked up the
same signal.</i>

06:32.510 --> 06:33.976
<i>Could be another homing beacon.</i>

06:34.045 --> 06:35.911
<i>Let's rendezvous at the
coordinates.</i>

07:09.347 --> 07:12.281
Silas, another one's headed
toward our position.

07:12.350 --> 07:14.750
Estimated arrival ... two minutes.

07:14.819 --> 07:16.685
Work briskly.

07:36.706 --> 07:40.476
It would appear the signal
was a trap.

07:40.544 --> 07:43.779
Better Bumblebee than me.

07:51.755 --> 07:53.989
The backup is ahead of schedule.

07:54.058 --> 07:57.326
As luck would have it...

07:57.395 --> 07:58.827
So am I.

07:58.896 --> 07:59.828
Move out.

08:17.681 --> 08:21.683
Bee!
Who did this? 'Cons?

08:23.087 --> 08:25.454
One way to find out. Come on!

08:51.481 --> 08:53.916
We rolling or not?

08:56.153 --> 08:58.020
What do you mean, you can't?

09:13.885 --> 09:15.618
You can fix Bee, can't you? 

09:15.687 --> 09:17.753
Bumblebee was hit pretty hard.

09:17.822 --> 09:20.323
The stun blasts may have fried
his T-Cog.

09:20.391 --> 09:22.658
Is that like a T-bone?

09:22.727 --> 09:23.693
Not exactly.

09:23.761 --> 09:28.064
It's the organ that allows us to
scan vehicles and transform.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.068
By the allspark.

09:32.136 --> 09:36.339
Bumblebee's T-Cog isn't damaged.
It's missing.

09:38.942 --> 09:42.278
But the Decepticons transform, too.
Why would they steal that?

09:42.347 --> 09:45.615
Megatron may be known to
raise zombies, but he's no ghoul.

09:45.683 --> 09:49.252
If Megatron wasn't behind
this, then who was?

09:49.320 --> 09:52.889
The ones who cannibalized
Breakdown.

09:52.957 --> 09:55.024
And tried to gut me.

09:55.093 --> 09:56.359
M.E.C.H.

09:56.427 --> 09:58.928
And it would appear their
knowledge of cybertronian

09:58.997 --> 10:01.130
biotech has grown more
sophisticated.

10:01.199 --> 10:04.000
But why would they want
Bumblebee's part?

10:08.740 --> 10:10.339
Bumblebee, please.

10:10.408 --> 10:14.377
You are not presently equipped
to handle this.

10:17.782 --> 10:19.715
You're mistaken, my friend.

10:19.784 --> 10:23.719
I do know what it's like to lose
a vital part of oneself.

10:23.788 --> 10:28.124
And, as a result, I know the
value of putting one's faith in

10:28.192 --> 10:30.860
the strength of those around
you.

10:30.929 --> 10:35.865
We vow to do everything in our
power to make you whole again.

10:35.934 --> 10:40.403
And if not, Ratchet can just
make you a new... cog thing, right?

10:44.309 --> 10:45.241
What'd I say?

10:45.310 --> 10:49.579
Miko, a T-Cog is a biomechanism,
not a scrapyard find.

10:49.647 --> 10:52.315
If it were that easy, don't you
think I would have replaced

10:52.383 --> 10:54.483
Bumblebee's voice box by now?

10:59.256 --> 11:01.457
You're not useless, Bee.

11:08.699 --> 11:09.899
All right, all right,

11:09.968 --> 11:12.902
I say none of us transform until
Bumblebee gets his cog back.

11:12.971 --> 11:15.404
Your spark's in the right
place, Bulkhead.

11:15.473 --> 11:18.808
But I don't think now is the
time to be limiting ourselves.

11:18.876 --> 11:23.679
Not with Megatron potentially
seeking other doomsday devices.

11:23.748 --> 11:26.682
And, I fear, not while M.E.C.H. uses

11:26.751 --> 11:32.121
Bumblebee's T-Cog for their own
sinister purpose.

11:47.971 --> 11:51.407
Commence beta test.

12:06.390 --> 12:07.823
Installation complete.

12:07.892 --> 12:09.525
Commencing scan.

12:19.237 --> 12:20.870
Scan successful.

12:22.006 --> 12:23.606
Commencing transformation.

12:55.005 --> 13:01.977
You are the ones who turned poor
Breakdown into a pitiful science experiment?

13:02.046 --> 13:04.880
Didn't learn much from the
experience, did you?

13:11.421 --> 13:14.857
Enough to know where the soft
spots are... Decepticon.

13:14.926 --> 13:19.829
Oh, please. I am
no longer affiliated with that entity.

13:19.897 --> 13:24.533
Besides, if I were here to
avenge the big lug, you would be

13:24.602 --> 13:27.169
screaming for mercy by now.

13:27.238 --> 13:29.238
Why are you here?

13:29.307 --> 13:31.307
To propose an alliance.

13:31.375 --> 13:35.745
You see, we have much more in
common than you might think.

13:35.813 --> 13:40.716
And I am not merely referring to
our battle scars.

13:40.785 --> 13:44.220
What could I possibly gain
from such an arrangement?

13:44.288 --> 13:48.023
Insider knowledge.

13:54.872 --> 13:57.107
Wise choice. 

13:57.176 --> 14:03.480
Now, a T-Cog isn't technology.
It is biology.

14:03.549 --> 14:09.820
Which means it will reject any
power source other than Energon.

14:09.888 --> 14:11.021
Go on.

14:11.089 --> 14:16.960
Energon is the fuel, the
ammunition, and the lifeblood

14:17.029 --> 14:21.531
of all cybertronians ...
whatever their affiliation.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.800
You and I both want it, and

14:23.869 --> 14:27.537
currently, I lack
the means of locating it.

14:27.606 --> 14:30.440
But once I supply you with the...

14:31.176 --> 14:34.945
...particulars of its chemical
makeup...

14:42.119 --> 14:45.889
...we can utilize your
considerable resources to devise

14:45.958 --> 14:49.960
a means of detecting new
deposits for us to share.

14:50.028 --> 14:54.865
If the supply meets M.E.C.H.'s
rather significant demand.

14:54.933 --> 15:01.104
Ah.
Intending to build an army, are you?

15:01.173 --> 15:06.276
I am no stranger to ambition.

15:09.514 --> 15:12.616
Optimus and Bulkhead haven't
reported in yet.

15:14.686 --> 15:15.518
Bumblebee!

15:15.587 --> 15:18.755
I will let you know the moment i
hear something.

15:20.659 --> 15:22.893
Oh, for Primus' sake.

15:24.162 --> 15:27.631
Will someone keep him occupied
so I can get some work done?!

15:27.699 --> 15:29.266
Hey, Bee.

15:29.334 --> 15:31.501
How about a video game?

15:40.746 --> 15:43.079
- Ooh, bad call.
- Sorry.

15:43.148 --> 15:46.116
Hey, no big deal.
That game's lame.

15:46.184 --> 15:48.118
What do you say we watch some tv?

15:55.927 --> 15:57.427
<i>The new Urbana 500.</i>

15:57.496 --> 16:01.097
<i>It won't just rock your world.
It will transform it.</i>

16:07.005 --> 16:10.807
Taking the auto out of an
autobot is so not a good thing.

16:10.876 --> 16:15.245
Bee, come on.
You're just as amazing without wheels.

16:15.314 --> 16:19.082
I mean, speed isn't everything.

16:25.690 --> 16:28.792
Personal best, Arcee.
You hit 120 easy.

16:31.196 --> 16:32.629
- Oh.
- Uh-oh.

16:35.867 --> 16:39.135
Bumblebee!
Where do you think you're going?

16:40.172 --> 16:42.105
You can't just go for a walk.

16:42.174 --> 16:45.675
We are robots in disguise.
Leaving the base in this form

16:45.744 --> 16:49.646
puts you at risk of being seen
and of us being discovered!

16:49.715 --> 16:53.249
You'll just have to remain in
the silo until ...

17:00.391 --> 17:05.729
Yes, Bumblebee.
Until I can fix you.

17:16.406 --> 17:17.540
In you go.

17:17.608 --> 17:22.045
Thanks for the lift home,
friend of... Jack's mom ...

17:22.114 --> 17:25.281
who's a nurse at ... at ...
at the hospital.

17:25.349 --> 17:26.915
Where are the others?

17:26.984 --> 17:30.854
Jack's at work.
Miko's in detention ... again.

17:30.922 --> 17:32.622
I was expecting Bulkhead.

17:32.691 --> 17:38.128
Well, I'm sorry to
disappoint, but he's on watch duty.

17:38.196 --> 17:41.965
You want to ride with the
siren on?

17:42.034 --> 17:44.134
No, thank you.

17:46.705 --> 17:49.172
This could be it.
I'll alert the others.

17:50.108 --> 17:53.943
I know you and I can handle
it, Bee, but there's no reason to ...

17:54.012 --> 17:56.579
What are you trying to prove?

18:03.888 --> 18:08.024
Ratchet, what happened to
Bumblebee's voice box?

18:08.093 --> 18:11.895
It was...
severely damaged in battle.

18:11.963 --> 18:12.695
How?

18:12.764 --> 18:17.000
How do you think?
Tragically, of course.

18:17.069 --> 18:21.337
<i>It happened at Tiger Pax.</i>

18:21.406 --> 18:26.743
<i>Our brave scout was captured by
Megatron's forces and interrogated.</i>

18:26.812 --> 18:34.250
<i>But he refused to provide intel...
and paid a grave price for his courage.</i>

18:34.319 --> 18:36.586
<i>Bumblebee was left for scrap.</i>

18:36.688 --> 18:41.191
<i>But autobot troops found him and
evacuated him to a triage facility...</i>

18:41.259 --> 18:46.563
<i>where a field medic
managed to stabilize his condition.</i>

18:46.631 --> 18:50.200
So, we owe Bumblebee's life
to that field medic.

18:50.268 --> 18:53.703
That's one way of looking at
it, I suppose.

18:53.772 --> 18:57.474
Though the medic...
could have done better.

19:06.484 --> 19:07.917
Clear.

19:08.587 --> 19:10.753
I still don't know how you
talked me into this.

19:10.822 --> 19:12.922
You're worse than Miko.

19:16.328 --> 19:17.927
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

19:19.498 --> 19:21.731
Not every mission ends in a
high-speed pursuit.

19:21.800 --> 19:22.665
But without your ...

19:25.270 --> 19:27.003
Fine. I'll drop it.

19:27.072 --> 19:31.141
But if Optimus finds out, this
was not my idea.

19:36.047 --> 19:38.815
Signal's coming from over there.

19:39.718 --> 19:41.818
And it's coming our way ... fast!

19:44.389 --> 19:46.156
Catch me if you can!

19:46.224 --> 19:47.157
I'll get him!

19:50.562 --> 19:52.495
Okay! You get him!

20:06.343 --> 20:08.144
Sporting of you.

20:14.586 --> 20:17.520
You're not even gonna try and
shoot out my tires?

20:19.090 --> 20:23.793
Bumblebee!
Where's your famous horsepower, huh?

20:23.862 --> 20:26.229
Show me some speed!

20:44.148 --> 20:47.083
What is with the rent-a-car?

20:57.628 --> 21:01.064
I'd stick around
and do some donuts around you... 

21:01.132 --> 21:05.568
but I have a delivery to make.
