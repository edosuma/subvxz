10:28.823 --> 10:30.459
RIGGS:
I don't know.

10:30.459 --> 10:32.096
He hasn't said a word.

10:32.096 --> 10:34.535
Well, that's not abnormal
for a kid his age after

10:34.535 --> 10:35.837
witnessing
a traumatic event.

10:37.173 --> 10:38.342
(sighs)

10:38.342 --> 10:40.045
How's Sarah?

10:40.045 --> 10:41.883
Doctor said it's critical
but stable.

10:41.883 --> 10:44.822
The bullet fractured her skull,
but it missed her brain.

10:44.822 --> 10:45.991
They're prepping her
for surgery right now.

10:45.991 --> 10:48.228
It's gonna be about 24 hours
before she's conscious.

10:48.228 --> 10:49.932
Right now,

10:49.932 --> 10:51.502
kid's our
only witness.

10:51.502 --> 10:53.973
What do you think, Doc?
You can make him talk, right?

10:53.973 --> 10:55.944
Yeah, yeah, I'll just
wave my magic wand,

10:55.944 --> 10:57.213
since it works so well with you.

10:57.213 --> 10:57.948
(laughs)

11:00.319 --> 11:01.789
Be patient.

11:01.789 --> 11:03.058
Ethan's been through a lot.
He lost his father.

11:03.058 --> 11:04.895
He and his mom
moved around.

11:04.895 --> 11:06.498
Plus, he's been in
and out of foster care.

11:06.498 --> 11:08.001
Abuse?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.204
Neglect.

11:09.204 --> 11:11.308
Once, his mother took him
to a bar where she was working.

11:11.308 --> 11:13.278
Another time,
she left him at a playground

11:13.278 --> 11:14.982
so she could go
on a job interview.

11:14.982 --> 11:16.919
You know, I'll talk to him.

11:16.919 --> 11:20.560
Traumatized kids
need a protector.

11:20.560 --> 11:21.929
A father figure.

11:23.232 --> 11:26.338
Hey there, little man.

11:26.338 --> 11:28.877
I'm Detective Murtaugh.

11:28.877 --> 11:30.379
But you could
call me Roger.

11:30.379 --> 11:32.250
You mind if I ask you
a couple of quick questions?

11:32.250 --> 11:34.254
Hey, hey, hey.

11:34.254 --> 11:35.991
Not to give you
any parenting advice,

11:35.991 --> 11:38.095
but you have
his mother's blood on you.

11:38.095 --> 11:39.497
Yeah, on that...

11:39.497 --> 11:41.101
Oh...
Yeah, yeah.

11:41.101 --> 11:44.107
Um... hey, little man,

11:44.107 --> 11:46.579
this nice lady here is gonna
take you back to the office

11:46.579 --> 11:48.348
and ask you a few questions.

11:48.348 --> 11:51.522
Hey, Ethan, would you rather
ride with Detective Riggs?

11:51.522 --> 11:53.358
No, why would he want
to ride with me?

11:53.358 --> 11:54.160
You have a siren?

11:56.666 --> 11:58.368
Yeah, I got a siren.

11:58.368 --> 11:59.638
And flashing lights?

11:59.638 --> 12:01.876
Yeah, those, too.

12:01.876 --> 12:02.978
Then I'll go with you.

12:02.978 --> 12:04.615
Okay.
Well, that settles it.

12:04.615 --> 12:07.420
Ethan, please make sure
Detective Riggs

12:07.420 --> 12:08.890
wears his seat belt.

12:16.973 --> 12:19.243
All right, let's see, we got
all your major food groups.

12:19.243 --> 12:21.214
We got cheese puffs,
potato chips.

12:21.214 --> 12:22.216
You got
peanut butter pieces...

12:22.216 --> 12:23.553
Are you gonna find the guy

12:23.553 --> 12:24.922
who shot my mom?

12:26.993 --> 12:28.495
Yeah, of course I am.

12:28.495 --> 12:30.165
You know, but, look,

12:30.165 --> 12:32.203
any information you can give me
will greatly help.

12:32.203 --> 12:33.840
I only saw the engine cover.

12:41.054 --> 12:43.058
You were at the casino
during the heist.

12:43.058 --> 12:44.995
Your mom said she saw it

12:44.995 --> 12:46.899
'cause you weren't
supposed to be there.

12:49.404 --> 12:51.509
The babysitter flaked.

12:51.509 --> 12:53.579
Again.

12:53.579 --> 12:55.382
And Mom's boss
said he'd fire her

12:55.382 --> 12:57.587
if she missed one more shift,
so she took me.

12:57.587 --> 13:00.292
I was behind the bar.

13:00.292 --> 13:02.063
If you tell,

13:02.063 --> 13:03.265
they'll take me away.

13:03.265 --> 13:05.202
Who am I gonna tell?
Come on.

13:05.202 --> 13:06.939
Besides, it's a good thing
you were there.

13:06.939 --> 13:08.341
You found us a clue.

13:08.341 --> 13:11.081
You're pretty good
at this crime stopping stuff.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.385
I'm not gonna fall for any
of this junior detective crap.

13:13.385 --> 13:14.253
I'm not five.

13:17.326 --> 13:20.132
Can you catch a cheese puff
in your mouth?

13:20.132 --> 13:21.569
In midair?

13:21.569 --> 13:23.305
'Cause I can.

13:26.311 --> 13:30.119
I want you to listen to me,
all right, Ethan?

13:30.119 --> 13:33.158
'Cause I'm not kidding around.

13:33.158 --> 13:35.028
I've caught more cheese puffs

13:35.028 --> 13:37.667
in my mouth in midair
than anybody else

13:37.667 --> 13:40.405
on the whole planet.

13:40.405 --> 13:41.141
Prove it.

13:44.113 --> 13:45.617
All right.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.386
Gonna make a deal.

13:47.386 --> 13:50.025
For each one of these I catch,
you tell me something you know.

13:50.025 --> 13:51.762
Prepare to get wrecked.

13:51.762 --> 13:53.031
Yeah?

13:56.137 --> 13:58.074
All right?

13:58.074 --> 13:59.711
Notice anything about the guy
from last night?

13:59.711 --> 14:02.016
He said he was from the casino.

14:02.016 --> 14:04.555
Something about
a reward.

14:04.555 --> 14:06.592
But he was lying.

14:06.592 --> 14:07.393
I could tell.

14:07.393 --> 14:09.163
How?

14:19.450 --> 14:22.724
Look, grown‐ups lie to me
all the time.

14:22.724 --> 14:24.360
I can spot it a mile away.

14:30.372 --> 14:32.376
New deal.

14:32.376 --> 14:36.017
I don't lie to you,
you don't lie to me.

14:38.121 --> 14:39.457
Okay.

14:39.457 --> 14:40.660
Deal.

14:40.660 --> 14:43.064
All right.

14:46.805 --> 14:49.310
BAILEY: Found a clear shot
on the security footage.

14:49.310 --> 14:50.780
A snake engine cover.

14:50.780 --> 14:53.485
They're signature
at this guy's bike shop.

14:53.485 --> 14:55.088
Wow.

14:55.088 --> 14:57.761
Look at this
Harley Heritage Model.

14:57.761 --> 14:59.263
You're a motorcycle guy?

14:59.263 --> 15:00.767
I don't know what that means.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.104
Am I a guy who appreciates
a motorcycle?

15:03.104 --> 15:05.677
Yeah, had one
when I was 17.

15:05.677 --> 15:08.014
Nothing like this hog here.

15:08.014 --> 15:10.319
You used to have a motorcycle?

15:10.319 --> 15:11.321
Damn right.

15:11.321 --> 15:12.624
And I'd still have one today,

15:12.624 --> 15:14.528
but I gave it up
when Junior was born.

15:14.528 --> 15:16.598
Being the responsible
father and all.

15:16.598 --> 15:18.034
(chuckles)

15:18.034 --> 15:20.038
You got something to say,
say it.

15:20.038 --> 15:22.744
(chuckles) Nah, just...

15:22.744 --> 15:24.614
you on a motorcycle?

15:24.614 --> 15:25.616
It's funny.

15:25.616 --> 15:27.086
Funny?

15:27.086 --> 15:29.357
Yeah, like those dudes
from <i>CHiPs.</i>

15:29.357 --> 15:31.361
The TV show from the '70s
about the CHP...

15:31.361 --> 15:34.835
1977 to 1983,
to be exact.

15:34.835 --> 15:36.471
I'll forget more about <i>CHiPs</i>
while I'm sleeping

15:36.471 --> 15:38.074
than you'll ever know
in your whole life.

15:38.074 --> 15:39.477
MAN:
Can I help you two?

15:39.477 --> 15:42.149
Hope so.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.320
Murtaugh and
Bailey, LAPD.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.090
We're looking for any
customers that may have

15:46.090 --> 15:48.596
bought a bike from you
with a snake engine cover.

15:48.596 --> 15:51.100
They all do. I put a snake
on every engine I build.

15:52.302 --> 15:53.539
So, that's a dead end.

15:53.539 --> 15:55.610
Thanks anyway.
Sorry.

15:55.610 --> 15:57.514
Wait, hold‐hold on.
One other question.

15:57.514 --> 15:58.849
How much

15:58.849 --> 16:00.753
for this Harley Heritage?

16:00.753 --> 16:02.122
For you?

16:02.122 --> 16:03.826
(chuckles):
Yeah, for me.

16:03.826 --> 16:05.262
Why?

16:05.262 --> 16:06.497
Well...

16:08.368 --> 16:09.771
...you don't seem like
a bike guy.

16:11.174 --> 16:12.644
Oh, he is. He loves <i>CHiPs.</i>

16:12.644 --> 16:14.280
He does?

16:14.280 --> 16:15.382
He does.

16:17.219 --> 16:19.825
Did you know that
in season five,

16:19.825 --> 16:23.298
Erik Estrada quit and they
replaced him with Bruce Jenner?

16:23.298 --> 16:24.868
CAHILL:
<i>Okay, Ethan, I think it's time</i>

16:24.868 --> 16:26.337
for you to get some rest,

16:26.337 --> 16:28.642
and maybe to get
some real food in you.

16:28.642 --> 16:29.644
Not hungry.

16:29.644 --> 16:31.515
He did crush an entire bag
of cheese puffs, so...

16:31.515 --> 16:33.652
Okay, well, then
maybe just some rest.

16:33.652 --> 16:35.656
And listen, I think the
safest place for you tonight

16:35.656 --> 16:37.159
is gonna be at
a foster home.

16:37.159 --> 16:38.762
No, no, please.

16:41.367 --> 16:43.672
The last time I was
in foster care,

16:43.672 --> 16:46.143
I had...

16:46.143 --> 16:47.814
you know, an accident.

16:51.655 --> 16:53.626
(softly):
Hey.

16:53.626 --> 16:55.730
No big deal.

16:55.730 --> 16:57.667
I mean,
things happen, all right?

16:57.667 --> 16:58.836
I still have accidents.

16:58.836 --> 17:01.440
ETHAN:
Yeah, well...

17:01.440 --> 17:03.846
the foster lady hit me
with a belt,

17:03.846 --> 17:06.117
then made me spend the rest of
the night scrubbing the sheets

17:06.117 --> 17:08.154
in the bathtub.

17:08.154 --> 17:09.858
That's terrible, Ethan.

17:09.858 --> 17:12.664
But I promise you that
we would never place you...

17:12.664 --> 17:14.300
What about my Aunt Kristi?

17:14.300 --> 17:18.274
I stay with her all the time
when my mom has to work.

17:18.274 --> 17:21.280
Please, can I go to her house?

17:25.288 --> 17:26.658
Okay.

17:26.658 --> 17:29.496
If your aunt takes
responsibility for you,

17:29.496 --> 17:31.868
then yes, sure, but otherwise,
it's‐it's foster care.

17:31.868 --> 17:33.404
Yes.

17:33.404 --> 17:35.543
Riggs, can you
drive me over?

17:35.543 --> 17:36.945
We can run
all the red lights again.

17:36.945 --> 17:38.549
(chuckles):
What?

17:38.549 --> 17:40.620
Come on.

17:40.620 --> 17:41.722
I...

17:41.722 --> 17:44.193
We had the sirens on; it was
completely safe, you know.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.832
(quietly): Just can't‐‐ we
can't tell her stuff like that.

17:49.904 --> 17:51.975
And, that, young Ethan,

17:51.975 --> 17:55.382
is how Ponch met Jon on <i>CHiPs.</i>

17:55.382 --> 17:57.219
(laughs)
Good story, huh?

17:57.219 --> 17:59.289
Um, yeah... I guess.

17:59.289 --> 18:01.360
Rog, I just‐‐ I don't think
<i>CHiPs</i> really holds up....

18:01.360 --> 18:02.362
Don't.

18:02.362 --> 18:05.235
Just don't,
not with <i>CHiPs.</i>

18:05.235 --> 18:07.305
So what's your
aunt's name again?

18:07.305 --> 18:08.474
Kristi.

18:08.474 --> 18:10.880
Hi, Aunt Kristi.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.917
My mom got shot, and these are
the cops solving the case.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.188
I told them I could stay with
you instead of foster care.

18:15.188 --> 18:16.190
So tell them it's okay, okay?

18:16.190 --> 18:17.192
Hi, Ethan.

18:17.192 --> 18:18.862
Yes, I heard about your mom.

18:18.862 --> 18:20.599
I'm so sorry.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.503
But, uh, well...

18:22.503 --> 18:24.206
you see, I'm not really
his aunt.

18:24.206 --> 18:25.509
I just work with his mom,

18:25.509 --> 18:26.678
and now's not a very
good time for me,

18:26.678 --> 18:27.947
so...

18:27.947 --> 18:30.218
My mom told me
to call her Aunt Kristi.

18:30.218 --> 18:31.621
And I really do stay here.
I know, I know,

18:31.621 --> 18:32.757
I know, come on.

18:32.757 --> 18:34.393
Sometimes.

18:36.531 --> 18:38.401
I'm sorry, really, but...

18:38.401 --> 18:39.771
I just can't.
I'm sorry.

18:39.771 --> 18:41.742
Okay.

18:41.742 --> 18:43.411
Is everything all right
with you?

18:43.411 --> 18:45.014
You seem a little...
flustered.

18:45.014 --> 18:46.417
Everything's fine.

18:46.417 --> 18:48.354
I need to go.

18:50.659 --> 18:51.828
(lock clicks)

18:51.828 --> 18:53.632
♪ ♪

19:10.800 --> 19:13.337
Rog, you good?

19:13.337 --> 19:15.241
Yeah, I'll be right there.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.343
Just checking something out.

19:23.692 --> 19:26.197
Hey, Riggs, why don't you get
Ethan in the car.

19:29.804 --> 19:31.508
Look at me.

19:31.508 --> 19:33.411
You stay in this car,
lay down in the seat,

19:33.411 --> 19:34.681
and don't get up, okay?

19:34.681 --> 19:36.417
Low, lay down.

19:39.724 --> 19:41.695
Kristi?

19:41.695 --> 19:43.431
May I come in?

19:48.709 --> 19:49.978
(gunshot)

19:53.585 --> 19:54.587
Not polite to shoot
at strangers, you know!

19:56.825 --> 19:58.862
Why don't you come out here so
we can get to know each other?

20:03.104 --> 20:04.807
(Kristi screams)

20:04.807 --> 20:06.511
(crying):
Oh, no!

20:08.481 --> 20:10.051
MURTAUGH: You have the
right to remain silent.

20:10.051 --> 20:11.788
Anything you say

20:11.788 --> 20:13.992
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

20:13.992 --> 20:15.729
Ethan!

20:15.729 --> 20:17.867
What are you doing?
I told you to stay in the car.

20:17.867 --> 20:20.506
I... I know.
I‐I just...

20:20.506 --> 20:21.975
What? You just what?!

20:21.975 --> 20:23.812
(crying):
I'm sorry.

20:23.812 --> 20:26.618
We're here because of me.
I'm sorry!

20:26.618 --> 20:29.624
Look, it's okay,
all right?

20:29.624 --> 20:30.893
Look, I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

20:30.893 --> 20:32.830
Please...

20:43.150 --> 20:46.156
I want to talk to my lawyer.

20:46.156 --> 20:48.695
There'll be time for that,
don't worry.

20:48.695 --> 20:50.599
And you're gonna have
a lot to talk about,

20:50.599 --> 20:52.737
seeing as you're being
charged with attempted murder

20:52.737 --> 20:54.941
of a police officer.

20:54.941 --> 20:56.644
But you can make it
a little easier on yourself

20:56.644 --> 20:59.784
by telling me what you know
about the casino robbery.

20:59.784 --> 21:02.088
Know what would've made things
easier for me?

21:02.088 --> 21:03.992
What's that?

21:03.992 --> 21:06.765
If I hadn't just missed
that big, bald head of yours.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.034
Close but no
cigar, right?

21:08.034 --> 21:08.935
(both laugh)

21:10.471 --> 21:12.042
Maybe I should thank you.

21:12.042 --> 21:14.479
Because ever since
our encounter, I decided

21:14.479 --> 21:16.417
I'm gonna start doing the things
<i>I</i> always wanted to do,

21:16.417 --> 21:17.920
like causing bodily harm

21:17.920 --> 21:19.824
to scumbags that try to hurt me.

21:19.824 --> 21:20.893
That's enough, Detective.

21:20.893 --> 21:22.963
That's enough.

21:24.934 --> 21:26.805
Let's go.

21:33.585 --> 21:34.787
Okay, little man,
here's what we're gonna do.

21:34.787 --> 21:35.923
Who's this guy?

21:35.923 --> 21:37.660
The boss.

21:37.660 --> 21:39.530
Look, what he's trying
to say is take your time.

21:39.530 --> 21:40.732
All right?
Look at these guys

21:40.732 --> 21:42.937
and tell us if one of them's
the one that shot your mom.

21:42.937 --> 21:45.007
What if I don't know?
You gonna yell at me again?

21:45.007 --> 21:46.644
It depends.
No.

21:46.644 --> 21:47.880
You gonna ignore
my advice again?

21:47.880 --> 21:49.684
Maybe.
Then maybe.

21:51.554 --> 21:52.957
You ready?

21:54.059 --> 21:55.762
(sighs)

21:55.762 --> 21:57.198
Yeah, come on.

22:00.639 --> 22:01.608
All right.

22:03.043 --> 22:06.116
Now, remember,
they can't see us.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.753
Only we can see them,
all right?

22:17.773 --> 22:18.875
Are any of these men

22:18.875 --> 22:20.077
the one that shot your mom?

22:23.818 --> 22:25.254
You see anyone you recognize?

22:25.254 --> 22:27.760
No.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.095
Sorry.

22:29.095 --> 22:30.264
It's okay.

22:30.264 --> 22:32.870
You did great.

22:32.870 --> 22:34.105
We are so proud of you

22:34.105 --> 22:35.676
and we support you.

22:35.676 --> 22:37.813
Um... okay. Thanks.

22:37.813 --> 22:39.584
It's important that children
always feel supported.

22:39.584 --> 22:40.586
Oh.
It's what, uh...
it's what...

22:40.586 --> 22:42.756
You, uh... you feel
supported there, Ethan?

22:42.756 --> 22:44.159
What does that even mean?
Yeah.

22:44.159 --> 22:46.864
Well, it means that you feel,
you know...

22:49.670 --> 22:50.739
...support.

22:50.739 --> 22:51.874
Good talk.

22:51.874 --> 22:53.077
Good talk.

22:53.077 --> 22:54.179
Yeah, all right.
(clears throat)

22:54.179 --> 22:56.149
Let's see if we can find
some doughnuts or something.

22:56.149 --> 22:57.987
ETHAN:
Cops always have doughnuts.

23:02.495 --> 23:03.832
Hey.

23:03.832 --> 23:04.967
You're home early.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.606
Yeah. Things got a little down
and a whole lot dirty

23:07.606 --> 23:09.175
during an arrest.

23:09.175 --> 23:10.177
Everything okay?

23:10.177 --> 23:11.748
Everything's fine.

23:13.818 --> 23:16.524
Hey, Trish.

23:16.524 --> 23:18.060
You know, I was thinking
about what you said about

23:18.060 --> 23:19.897
we got to dream big,

23:19.897 --> 23:21.734
don't let anything get
in the way of our adventure.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.037
I think you were right.

23:24.674 --> 23:26.611
(laughs):
Baby...

23:26.611 --> 23:27.813
You want to go to Kilimanjaro?

23:27.813 --> 23:29.182
No.

23:29.182 --> 23:31.320
I want to buy a motorcycle.

23:31.320 --> 23:33.157
Oh, a motorcycle?

23:33.157 --> 23:34.225
Yeah, I saw one

23:34.225 --> 23:36.263
just like the hog I used to ride

23:36.263 --> 23:37.866
when RJ was little.

23:37.866 --> 23:39.002
I figure I can put you
on the back of it.

23:39.002 --> 23:41.106
Can take long rides
on the beach.

23:41.106 --> 23:43.277
Baby, we are not getting
a motorcycle.

23:43.277 --> 23:44.346
Why not?

23:44.346 --> 23:45.882
They're dangerous.

23:45.882 --> 23:48.855
And to be honest,
you'll look silly on it.

23:48.855 --> 23:51.794
You are not a
motorcycle‐type guy.

23:51.794 --> 23:55.201
First of all,
being a cop is dangerous.

23:55.201 --> 23:58.875
Climbing big mountains
in Africa is dangerous.

23:58.875 --> 24:02.549
Someone telling you that you
look silly on your motorcycle

24:02.549 --> 24:03.918
is dangerous.

24:03.918 --> 24:06.022
And most importantly,
I am

24:06.022 --> 24:08.494
totally a motorcycle
type of guy.

24:10.565 --> 24:13.270
Okay, I'm sorry to do this,
but...

24:13.270 --> 24:17.078
Hawaii, 2003, Mauna
Loa Road incident.

24:17.078 --> 24:19.149
That wasn't even a motorcycle.

24:19.149 --> 24:21.219
I know! It was a bicycle, Roger.

24:21.219 --> 24:23.725
The degree of difficulty
way lower,

24:23.725 --> 24:25.094
and how many stitches
did you need?

24:25.094 --> 24:26.229
It was a tandem bike.

24:26.229 --> 24:27.331
Oh.
Tandem.

24:27.331 --> 24:28.668
And it was your fault.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.639
(laughs):
My fault? That's funny.

24:30.639 --> 24:32.074
You lost the rhythm.

24:34.212 --> 24:37.218
Whoa, slow down there,
little man.

24:37.218 --> 24:38.855
Captain Avery,
I'm Madeline Tate,

24:38.855 --> 24:40.257
defense attorney
for Russell Carswell.

24:40.257 --> 24:41.727
He's in holding.
I'll take you.

24:41.727 --> 24:42.830
Off the record,
Ms. Tate,

24:42.830 --> 24:45.836
your client fired a shotgun
at one of my detectives.

24:45.836 --> 24:48.140
We also have developing
intel on his involvement

24:48.140 --> 24:49.275
in the casino robbery.
Mm‐hmm.

24:49.275 --> 24:51.413
Not a lot of wiggle
room for the D. A.,

24:51.413 --> 24:52.014
unless your client
starts cooperating.

24:52.014 --> 24:52.883
CRUZ:
Hey, Captain,

24:52.883 --> 24:54.787
what do you want me
to tell foster care

24:54.787 --> 24:56.389
about how long
we need that kid?

24:56.389 --> 24:57.893
He do the lineup yet?

24:57.893 --> 24:58.928
Tell them I'll call them.

24:58.928 --> 25:00.431
All right.

25:00.431 --> 25:01.500
Different case.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.103
Thank you, Captain.
I'll take it under advisement.

25:03.103 --> 25:04.305
Mm‐hmm.

25:08.781 --> 25:11.988
(Murtaugh chuckles)

25:11.988 --> 25:15.261
Are you sure you
know how to ride it?

25:15.261 --> 25:17.900
Do I seriously look like a guy
who can't ride a motorcycle?

25:17.900 --> 25:19.269
Yup.

25:19.269 --> 25:21.106
It's yours now.

25:21.106 --> 25:22.910
Just got to get you
to fill out paperwork.

25:22.910 --> 25:24.012
Be right back.

25:24.012 --> 25:26.116
Okay.

25:26.116 --> 25:28.053
(laughs)

25:29.322 --> 25:31.126
Yeah.

25:31.126 --> 25:33.063
Oh.

25:44.987 --> 25:46.356
Hey.

25:46.356 --> 25:48.427
You want a picture of me
standing next to my bike

25:48.427 --> 25:50.799
so you can put it
on your wall of...

26:05.795 --> 26:07.198
ETHAN:
<i>You live here?</i>

26:07.198 --> 26:08.200
Right?

26:08.200 --> 26:10.337
Clubhouse on the beach. Oh.

26:10.337 --> 26:11.841
It's awesome.

26:11.841 --> 26:13.845
Ah, yes, it is.

26:13.845 --> 26:15.414
Ooh, all right.

26:15.414 --> 26:17.018
Hey, what have you got to eat?

26:17.018 --> 26:19.322
I'm starving.

26:19.322 --> 26:21.092
Um...

26:22.161 --> 26:23.731
Here. Beef jerky.

26:23.731 --> 26:25.769
High in protein, low in fat.

26:25.769 --> 26:28.206
It's like a superfood.

26:28.206 --> 26:29.810
What's super about it?

26:29.810 --> 26:31.914
Well, it's called jerky.
That's a good thing.

26:31.914 --> 26:33.785
Um, all right,

26:33.785 --> 26:36.991
so as you know, legally,
you're not supposed to be here.

26:36.991 --> 26:39.262
Don't worry.
I know how to keep a secret.

26:39.262 --> 26:41.366
I cover for my mom
all the time.

26:41.366 --> 26:42.368
Oh, yeah?

26:42.368 --> 26:44.272
Yup.

26:47.144 --> 26:48.748
ETHAN:
You drink a lot.

26:50.050 --> 26:52.254
You an alcoholic?

26:52.254 --> 26:54.459
Well, that's a very
grown‐up concept, Ethan.

26:54.459 --> 26:56.964

Well, I was hoping
you had better things to do

28:58.406 --> 28:59.543
with your evening
than check up on me.

28:59.543 --> 29:00.878
This isn't
about you, Riggs.

29:00.878 --> 29:02.247
This is about Ethan.

29:02.247 --> 29:03.483
I'm very concerned
about him.

29:03.483 --> 29:05.989
Has he had a decent meal
in the last 48 hours?

29:05.989 --> 29:07.993
Has he changed his clothes,
brushed his teeth?

29:07.993 --> 29:09.863
Look, you may have me
on the meal thing,

29:09.863 --> 29:11.132
but he turned
his underwear inside out.

29:11.132 --> 29:12.401
And I know that
might not, you know,

29:12.401 --> 29:13.269
live up to
your standards...

29:13.269 --> 29:14.973
Do you even hear yourself
right now?

29:14.973 --> 29:16.275
How am I gonna get this kid
to trust me

29:16.275 --> 29:17.946
if I go dump him
in some crappy foster home?

29:17.946 --> 29:19.315
Does he trust you now?

29:19.315 --> 29:21.486
(sighs)

29:21.486 --> 29:24.025
He told me that he did not
see his mom's shooter.

29:24.025 --> 29:26.195
He lied to us 'cause
he was hoping that we could...

29:26.195 --> 29:27.832
give him and his mom
a fresh start.

29:30.470 --> 29:32.174
That's my fault.

29:32.174 --> 29:34.880
I should've seen that a child
as parentified as Ethan

29:34.880 --> 29:37.451
would've done anything
to protect his mother.

29:37.451 --> 29:39.021
Tough little man.

29:39.021 --> 29:40.658
Got to give him that.

29:40.658 --> 29:42.194
Well, maybe
in foster care,

29:42.194 --> 29:44.633
he'll be allowed
to be a child again.

29:44.633 --> 29:45.635
Okay, about that...

29:45.635 --> 29:47.071
No, enough is
enough, Riggs.

29:47.071 --> 29:48.273
He's not a
witness anymore.

29:48.273 --> 29:49.375
We can't keep
him any longer.

29:49.375 --> 29:50.645
S‐So what am I
supposed to do?

29:50.645 --> 29:52.414
Just say sayonara
and dump him in the system?

29:52.414 --> 29:54.251
It sucks, but, yes,
that's the way it works.

30:00.130 --> 30:01.967
I'll drive him to foster care.

30:03.069 --> 30:05.942
Let me do it.

through the system.

30:23.009 --> 30:24.546
Not even an unpaid
parking ticket,

30:24.546 --> 30:26.282
but three years ago,
he filed a restraining order

30:26.282 --> 30:27.752
against this guy
named Billy Gottlieb,

30:27.752 --> 30:29.255
his stepson from
a first marriage.

30:29.255 --> 30:31.025
In the court docs,
Fisher says that

30:31.025 --> 30:32.294
Billy demanded
money from him

30:32.294 --> 30:33.664
and threatened him
physically.
MURTAUGH: Hmm.

30:33.664 --> 30:35.400
Does Billy the Kid
have a record?

30:35.400 --> 30:37.237
One prior for assault,
two for robbery.

still have a witness.

might be a kid.

31:21.425 --> 31:23.463
Russ said they brought
a boy to his girlfriend's place.

The son of that waitress.

42:59.320 --> 43:00.757
I'm not angry,
I'm just disappointed.

43:00.757 --> 43:03.228
Yeah, all right.

43:03.228 --> 43:05.232
So, uh, do you guys
want to come get it,

43:05.232 --> 43:07.169
or should I bring it to you?

43:07.169 --> 43:09.875
Just put the gas
down and go.

43:09.875 --> 43:11.044
Where were we?
Kissing.
