00:01.201 --> 00:03.761
<i>Coming up on the season finale
of "MILF Island"...</i>

00:03.903 --> 00:05.495
<i>Holy hot mamas!</i>

00:05.638 --> 00:09.165
<i>But who will be the final mommy
you'd like to... oh, you know.</i>

00:09.309 --> 00:10.742
<i>I came here to be number one!</i>

00:10.877 --> 00:12.640
<i>Coming up next, here on NBC.</i>

00:15.281 --> 00:17.215
You guys gonna do
any work today, or...

00:17.350 --> 00:18.715
Zip it.
"MILF Island" is on.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.149
Oh. Ooh.

00:20.286 --> 00:24.552
<i>20 MILFs,
50 eighth-grade boys, no rules,</i>

00:24.691 --> 00:27.251
<i>and, tonight, one winner.</i>

00:27.394 --> 00:29.919
<i>Welcome to "MILF Island. "</i>

00:30.063 --> 00:31.621
This show is the worst.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.427
Didn't one of those MILFs die
during production?

00:34.567 --> 00:35.625
She had too much champagne,

00:35.769 --> 00:37.293
and a monkey knocked her
into some quicksand.

00:37.437 --> 00:39.029
It could've happened anywhere.

00:39.172 --> 00:40.901
Miss Lemon,
we might have a problem.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.838
I went through the paper,
looking for that article

00:42.976 --> 00:44.273
on speed dating
that you asked about...

00:45.512 --> 00:47.207
...when I came across this.

00:49.015 --> 00:51.245
Who did this?

00:51.384 --> 00:52.248
Who did what?

00:52.385 --> 00:55.377
This is from today's
"Page Six" gossip column.

00:55.522 --> 00:58.355
"Which 'TGS With Tracy Jordan'
staffer

00:58.491 --> 01:02.951
called corporate honcho
Jack Donaghy a class-A moron?

01:03.096 --> 01:05.257
Donaghy is up
for the GE chairmanship,

01:05.397 --> 01:07.389
but one employee
has misgivings,

01:07.534 --> 01:09.900
adding,
'That guy can eat my poo. "'

01:10.036 --> 01:11.970
Uh-oh.
Who said this?

01:12.105 --> 01:13.629
Not me.
Not me. Not me.

01:13.773 --> 01:15.604
Wasn't me. I wasn't
even at work that day.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.107
Liz...

01:17.243 --> 01:19.734
Mr. Donaghy would like to see
you in his office immediately.

01:19.879 --> 01:21.278
Well, it better not be
about that quote,

01:21.414 --> 01:23.507
because I am not taking
the bullet for this!

01:25.285 --> 01:28.152
This is bad...
like, lose-your-job bad.

01:29.355 --> 01:33.621
<i>Prepare for the craziest night
of television of your life.</i>

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

01:52.145 --> 01:54.136
Well, I'm going
to get yelled at.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.304
What's going on with you?

01:55.448 --> 01:57.143
The season finale
of "MILF Island,"

01:57.283 --> 01:59.376
and I'm gonna watch it alone
in my office.

01:59.519 --> 02:00.679
That's pretty grim, Pete.

02:00.820 --> 02:03.015
Ooh! A dangler!
Liz, I'm gonna get free food.

02:03.156 --> 02:03.884
Wow.

02:04.023 --> 02:05.456
It's SO YJO Y.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.321
Who doesn't love SO YJO Y?

02:07.460 --> 02:08.893
Somebody upstairs
has changed their mind

02:09.027 --> 02:10.655
about old Pete Hornberger.

02:12.098 --> 02:12.894
Ow!

02:16.936 --> 02:18.028
I'm stuck!

02:23.276 --> 02:26.541
Lemon... remember this?

02:26.679 --> 02:29.546
Deborah and Shauna
squaring off at Erection Cove.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.147
Um, I don't.
I don't really watch this show.

02:35.388 --> 02:36.412
That Deborah is amazing.

02:36.556 --> 02:39.548
Have you heard her story before
she was cast on "MILF Island"?

02:39.692 --> 02:42.058
She was just a struggling
actress living in L. A.

02:42.195 --> 02:43.628
Wow, that's inspiring.

02:43.763 --> 02:46.425
She has real star quality.
You should meet with her.

02:46.566 --> 02:48.431
Wait, is that why
you called me up here?

02:48.568 --> 02:51.969
Sir, I have Sumner Redstone
calling to congratulate you.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.094
I'll return.

02:53.239 --> 02:55.434
Calls have been pouring in
all night.

02:55.575 --> 02:56.803
"MILF Island" is huge.

02:56.943 --> 02:58.501
I guess
I should be out celebrating,

02:58.645 --> 03:00.237
but I'm waiting for a call
from Don Geiss.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.143
You think
he'll call me Jackie-boy?

03:02.282 --> 03:03.806
Then I'll be
in Erection Cove.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.009
Congratulations, Jack.

03:06.152 --> 03:07.119
You must be very proud.

03:07.253 --> 03:08.220
When you meet with Deborah,

03:08.354 --> 03:10.379
have her do her
Indian-cab-driver impression.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.923
She...
She really pulls it off.

03:13.059 --> 03:14.822
Now, why would I
meet with her?

03:14.961 --> 03:16.451
Because we're developing
a spin-off,

03:16.596 --> 03:17.722
and I thought
you could write it.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.263
Oh, no, thanks.

03:19.399 --> 03:21.128
I don't want anything to do
with "MILF Island. "

03:21.267 --> 03:23.963
That show is kind of
"lowest common denominator. "

03:24.103 --> 03:25.900
The critics said the same thing
about Shakespeare.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.303
Yeah, but Shakespeare never
had a confessional shower

03:28.441 --> 03:30.136
sponsored by Dove pro-age.

03:30.276 --> 03:32.244
So, you have seen the show.
And why shouldn't you?

03:32.378 --> 03:35.313
It has sex, lies, puberty,
betrayal, relay races.

03:35.448 --> 03:37.780
"MILF Island" reflects the drama
of the human experience.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.680
And isn't that
the essence of art?

03:39.819 --> 03:42.947
I don't think
eating bugs to earn tampons...

03:43.089 --> 03:44.488
Episode 9...
22 million viewers.

03:44.624 --> 03:45.784
...is art.

03:45.925 --> 03:48.393
Performance is an art.
Writing is an art.

03:48.528 --> 03:50.553
What we do is art.

03:50.697 --> 03:53.495
Someone put too many farts
in this engine!

03:53.633 --> 03:55.863
It's about to explode!

03:56.002 --> 03:57.765
Okay, fine,
don't meet with her.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.496
I just saw the opportunity

03:59.639 --> 04:01.470
for you to make
an obscene amount of money.

04:01.608 --> 04:04.202
Well, no, thanks.
I have integrity.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.039
It's farting!

04:06.179 --> 04:07.806
It's farting!

04:07.947 --> 04:10.074
Myirt.

04:10.216 --> 04:12.047
Anyway, unless there's
something else,

04:12.185 --> 04:13.709
I'm just gonna...

04:13.853 --> 04:18.654
Actually, we do need to resolve
the, uh, "Page Six" debacle.

04:20.159 --> 04:20.716
Oh.

04:20.860 --> 04:23.624
You know, if you Google
the phrase "class-A moron,"

04:23.763 --> 04:25.128
my name pops up first now.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.699
So step aside, Randy Quaid.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.563
Jack,
I'm sorry you saw that.

04:29.702 --> 04:31.795
It's not good timing for me
professionally.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.133
I will find out who did it.
I'll beat it out of them.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.901
No, no, here's how
we're gonna play this situation.

04:36.042 --> 04:37.907
We're gonna turn up the heat
on your people...

04:39.512 --> 04:41.275
...and see who breaks first.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.448
Jonathan!

04:46.953 --> 04:49.353
Could you round up
those idiots?

04:49.489 --> 04:50.820
Hey, buddies.

04:50.957 --> 04:51.981
He knows, doesn't he?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.752
Yeah, and he's not happy.

04:53.893 --> 04:55.952
Does he think it's me?
Did he... Did he mention me?

04:56.095 --> 04:57.153
No, I think you're safe

04:57.297 --> 04:59.094
because I think he forgot
that you're a person.

04:59.232 --> 04:59.789
Yeah!

04:59.932 --> 05:01.593
Come on,
how long is this gonna take?

05:01.734 --> 05:02.928
Our pizzas are downstairs,

05:03.069 --> 05:04.536
and the tribunal
was just about to make

05:04.671 --> 05:07.333
one of the last four MILFs
hang up her bikini top.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.738
<i>Zalutha...</i>

05:10.877 --> 05:13.471
you've kept it tight.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.874
Heidi...

05:17.016 --> 05:18.745
we no longer want to hit that.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.778
Get off MILF Island.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.456
Can I just get the pizzas
and bring them up here?

05:32.598 --> 05:35.431
No and no. You have to stay here
in case Mr. Donaghy calls you in.

05:35.568 --> 05:39.095
Look, whoever did this
needs to fess up now!

05:40.173 --> 05:43.802
I can protect you.
I just need to know who it is.

05:45.211 --> 05:47.771
Fine. Everybody but me,
close your eyes.

05:47.914 --> 05:50.144
Whoever did it,
raise your hand.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.152
Oh, really mature, guys.

05:53.286 --> 05:54.548
You are on your own.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.780
Miss Lemon, can I have
a word with you, please?

05:56.923 --> 05:58.220
Ohh.

05:59.258 --> 06:00.691
Lutz, come here.

06:02.261 --> 06:03.455
We should form an alliance.

06:03.596 --> 06:05.291
A what?
An alliance.

06:05.431 --> 06:07.194
We're the two biggest dirtbags
around here.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.425
They're gonna try
to blame us.

06:08.568 --> 06:10.729
I don't think
people see me that way.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.998
Yeah, they do. You and me...
couple of fat pervert losers.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.040
My sister-in-law
did kind of a makeover on me.

06:16.175 --> 06:18.871
No. No.

06:19.011 --> 06:21.844
Hello!
A little help!

06:21.981 --> 06:26.680
My shirt is caught on what feels
like a very sharp... mechanism!

06:27.787 --> 06:29.311
Maybe if I can get
the shirt off.

06:37.997 --> 06:39.089
Ow!

06:41.768 --> 06:42.996
What?!

06:43.136 --> 06:44.569
What is it, Kenneth?

06:44.704 --> 06:46.797
Well, I was thinking about
this item in the newspaper,

06:46.939 --> 06:48.167
and something
doesn't make sense.

06:48.307 --> 06:49.205
What do you mean?

06:49.342 --> 06:52.072
Well, I know Toofer
would never use the word "poo,"

06:52.211 --> 06:53.337
so it's not him.

06:53.479 --> 06:55.606
And Frank couldn't have done it,
because he was with me all day,

06:55.748 --> 06:57.045
making fun of my haircut.

06:57.183 --> 06:58.810
And, also, I saw you do it.

06:58.951 --> 07:03.979
<i>The game is about to change.</i>

07:05.358 --> 07:07.553
What do you mean,
you saw me do it?

07:07.693 --> 07:09.422
It was yesterday,
downstairs.

07:09.562 --> 07:11.860
Liz Lemon! I'm gonna miss
the show this week.

07:11.998 --> 07:14.193
Jack is sending me
to do stand-up in Dubai.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.062
I'm gonna do jokes
on airplane food.

07:16.202 --> 07:17.396
It's all new to them.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.471
What? No, Tracy,
you can't miss the show!

07:19.605 --> 07:20.970
Well, don't blame me!
Blame Jack.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.234
He's the one I'm splitting
the $3 million with.

07:23.376 --> 07:26.777
You and Jack Donaghy are
the cause of my jawline acne.

07:29.015 --> 07:30.107
You work for Jack Donaghy?

07:30.249 --> 07:33.650
That class-A moron?
Unfortunately.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.214
Must be tough taking orders
from a guy like that, huh?

07:37.356 --> 07:38.880
I don't take orders from him.

07:39.025 --> 07:40.959
He's an idiot.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

07:41.093 --> 07:42.788
That guy can eat my poo.

07:43.963 --> 07:44.861
You work here, too?

07:44.997 --> 07:47.625
<i>No, I'm a reporter
for the New York Post,</i>

07:47.767 --> 07:49.792
specializing
in business gossip.

07:51.437 --> 07:53.166
And then you asked him
if he was single.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.864
And he said, "Don't worry
about it," but then...

07:55.007 --> 07:56.907
Okay, fine!
You got me. I did it.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.601
But I am not taking the fall
for this one.

07:58.744 --> 08:01.907
I have taken too many bullets
for my idiot staff in the past.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.212
Jonathan,
did someone turn the heat up?

08:05.351 --> 08:07.751
No idea. Where I'm from,
we don't notice the heat.

08:07.887 --> 08:09.013
That's interesting.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.453
I didn't know it was hot
in Assylvania.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.287
I deserve one free pass.

08:14.427 --> 08:15.951
But that's not
the right thing to do.

08:16.095 --> 08:19.656
Yes, yes, Kenneth,
but Jack and I are friends.

08:19.799 --> 08:21.926
It would screw things up
if this came out.

08:22.068 --> 08:24.059
What if I really messed up
his chances

08:24.203 --> 08:25.261
at getting that promotion?

08:25.404 --> 08:29.636
I would be so sad
if I got caught for this.

08:29.775 --> 08:31.265
But you're not
supposed to lie.

08:31.410 --> 08:33.809
Oh!
You apple-faced goon!

08:33.946 --> 08:36.176
Fine, I will tell him.

08:37.149 --> 08:38.514
Oh, pray for me.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.425
Really?

08:48.561 --> 08:50.688
Is everyone watching TV?

08:53.733 --> 08:54.631
Ugh!

09:01.073 --> 09:01.630
Yes!

09:01.774 --> 09:03.298
Okay, okay.

09:03.442 --> 09:05.069
Okay.

09:06.112 --> 09:08.046
I just need four numbers.

09:08.180 --> 09:08.874
Ugh.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.313
Call anybody in the building.

09:11.450 --> 09:12.041
Ugh.

09:12.184 --> 09:14.880
Any... random... number.

09:24.964 --> 09:27.489
Yes! Hornberger!

09:30.603 --> 09:32.127
<i>Hello, you've reached
Pete Hornberger at "TGS."</i>

09:32.271 --> 09:33.397
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

09:33.539 --> 09:35.336
No!

09:37.944 --> 09:39.036
Hey.

09:40.112 --> 09:41.807
A class-A moron.

09:41.948 --> 09:45.076
Yeah, how are you doing?

09:45.217 --> 09:46.514
Lemon, can I share
something with you

09:46.652 --> 09:48.210
that I've never shared
with anyone in my life?

09:48.354 --> 09:49.343
I would rather you didn't.

09:49.488 --> 09:52.218
When I was a child,
I had a terrible stutter,

09:52.358 --> 09:55.555
and I was so embarrassed by it
that I rarely spoke in class.

09:55.695 --> 09:57.322
You were a stutterer?
Couldn't get a word out.

09:57.463 --> 09:59.897
Needless to say, I was
the object of some ridicule.

10:00.032 --> 10:02.899
Because of my reticence,
they assumed I was stupid.

10:03.035 --> 10:05.060
And the Massachusetts
public school system

10:05.204 --> 10:10.267
designated me
a Class-A Moron.

10:11.510 --> 10:13.137
Oh, no.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.270
The stutter got so bad,
I was taken out of my grade

10:15.414 --> 10:19.248
and put in the special class
held in the boiler room.

10:19.385 --> 10:21.819
My only other classmate
was named Gilly.

10:22.922 --> 10:24.549
He'd fallen through the ice
as a child

10:24.690 --> 10:26.590
and was technically dead
for 57 minutes.

10:27.760 --> 10:30.388
They told us to sweep sawdust
so we could find work at a mill.

10:30.529 --> 10:33.794
<i>I'm sure whoever said that thing
in the Post had no idea...</i>

10:33.933 --> 10:37.300
Of course, I overcame
the stutter in three languages,

10:37.436 --> 10:40.132
onto Princeton, Harvard, and
the top of the business world.

10:40.272 --> 10:41.432
I thought
I'd blocked this out,

10:41.574 --> 10:43.735
but a thing like this
brings back some old emotions.

10:43.876 --> 10:44.865
I'm so sorry.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.241
I feel like
I'm back in that boiler room,

10:47.380 --> 10:48.711
making little piles
of sawdust

10:48.848 --> 10:50.748
while Gilly plays with himself
in the corner.

10:52.551 --> 10:53.916
I'm sorry.
Did you want something?

10:55.087 --> 10:56.952
I just wanted to tell you...

10:59.659 --> 11:01.957
...that I've narrowed it down
to Toofer or Frank.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.356
Thank you.

11:05.431 --> 11:07.797
God, I am famished.
Oh.

11:07.933 --> 11:10.333
Those are Jack's.

11:10.469 --> 11:12.096
Come on, guys,
whoever did it,

11:12.238 --> 11:13.569
just confess
so we can get out of here.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.333
Why are you looking
at me and Lutz?

11:15.474 --> 11:16.634
I wasn't.

11:16.776 --> 11:19.939
I think Lutz will
tell you that, uh, I'm innocent.

11:20.079 --> 11:21.239
No, I won't, dude.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.644
What the frak?! I thought
we had a dirtbag alliance!

11:23.783 --> 11:26.343
I'm not a dirtbag!
This is from American Eagle!

11:26.485 --> 11:29.921
You formed an alliance?
That strongly insinuates guilt.

11:30.056 --> 11:32.991
<i>Well, I think pointing fingers
at people makes you seem guilty.</i>

11:33.125 --> 11:35.116
Thanks, Judas!
I thought we had a deal.

11:35.261 --> 11:36.853
Who cares if you went
to Harvard?!

11:36.996 --> 11:37.985
Everybody does!

11:38.130 --> 11:39.097
Who cares?!

11:39.231 --> 11:42.598
Debra... what was the hardest
part of this for you?

11:42.735 --> 11:46.193
I would have to say
The physical challenges.

11:46.338 --> 11:50.832
I mean, you're tired,
hungry, want to go home,

11:50.976 --> 11:52.637
and then you just
reach inside yourself,

11:52.778 --> 11:56.179
and you find the strength that
you didn't even know you had.

11:56.315 --> 11:58.977
I mean,
one of my implants exploded...

11:59.118 --> 12:01.177
and I didn't even ask
to get off the catapult.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.346
<i>Now, boys, there are only
two MILFs left...</i>

12:04.490 --> 12:06.185
<i>Debra...</i>

12:06.325 --> 12:07.383
<i>and Deborah.</i>

12:07.526 --> 12:09.494
<i>One of them is going home,</i>

12:09.628 --> 12:11.823
<i>and it will be revealed...</i>

12:12.832 --> 12:14.493
<i>...after three more breaks.</i>

12:14.633 --> 12:16.692
Deborah's played the game
so well.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.896
Even if she loses,
America's gonna want more.

12:20.039 --> 12:21.472
Maybe it's a talk show.

12:21.607 --> 12:23.336
No, Jack,
I'm not working on it.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.001
Jonathan, turn up the heat a
little more and send in Kenneth.

12:26.145 --> 12:27.737
Kenneth? We're gonna get
to the bottom of this.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.939
He won't know anything.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.674
Kenneth...

12:31.817 --> 12:33.910
you're the eyes
and ears of "TGS,"

12:34.053 --> 12:35.645
so Liz and I were hoping
you could help us

12:35.788 --> 12:37.551
to track down the person

12:37.690 --> 12:39.783
who's been saying these hurtful
things about me in the paper.

12:42.328 --> 12:46.389
Well, sir, I'm sure that
whoever did this regrets her...

12:47.299 --> 12:52.566
...or his mistake
and will do the right thing.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.229
I certainly hope so.

12:54.373 --> 12:56.238
Do you have any guesses?

13:00.379 --> 13:02.313
Kenneth, I need an answer.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.754
The stress of this
is making me awful sleepy.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.447
Sir!

13:11.590 --> 13:13.956
There's a call on 2 I think
you're gonna want to take.

13:14.093 --> 13:15.025
Mr. Geiss, I...

13:15.161 --> 13:16.788
Oh, hello,
Vice President Cheney.

13:16.929 --> 13:18.123
I'm gonna kill you.

13:18.264 --> 13:20.994
Uh, yes,
I hope Deborah wins, as well.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.901
No, they're not real,
unfortunately.

13:25.204 --> 13:26.068
Get out of here.

13:26.205 --> 13:27.604
I can't believe
you didn't tell him!

13:27.740 --> 13:29.173
You listen to me,
Li'I Abner.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.071
Keep your
fried-bologna hole shut.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.871
I am not going down for this!

13:33.012 --> 13:34.138
I'll tell him you did it.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.372
Who do you think
he's gonna believe?

13:35.514 --> 13:36.640
I'm important around here.

13:36.782 --> 13:39.114
Miss Lemon,
your eyes look like my uncle's

13:39.251 --> 13:41.116
after he would drink
from the air conditioner.

13:41.253 --> 13:42.948
<i>I thought we were friends.
Deborah...</i>

13:43.088 --> 13:45.147
I didn't come
here to make friends.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.589
I came here to be number one.

13:47.726 --> 13:48.590
Oh.

13:48.727 --> 13:49.625
Liz Lemon!

13:49.762 --> 13:51.992
I can't believe they put
what you said in the paper.

13:52.131 --> 13:53.826
Shh!
How do you know about that?

13:54.934 --> 13:56.492
This is a "Cathy" cartoon.

13:56.635 --> 13:57.897
Yeah, that cartoon copied

13:58.037 --> 14:00.130
exactly what you said
the other day.

14:00.272 --> 14:03.764
Chocolate! Chocolate!
Chocolate! Aack!

14:03.909 --> 14:07.003
If you decide to sue
them, I know a good lawyer.

14:07.146 --> 14:09.910
Took me to the cleaners
last year.

14:10.049 --> 14:11.607
The truth will come out...

14:11.750 --> 14:14.446
Like my cousin Stephen
after he went to music college,

14:14.587 --> 14:15.576
it will come out.

14:15.721 --> 14:19.487
<i>Stay tuned for one final
shocking twist.</i>

14:19.625 --> 14:20.523
Shut up.

14:20.659 --> 14:23.059
<i>Brought to you by SO YJO Y,
fortified with optimism.</i>

14:26.065 --> 14:27.999
Jack, it's almost 11:00.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.566
Why don't you
let those guys go home,

14:29.702 --> 14:31.226
and we'll all sleep on it?

14:31.370 --> 14:32.667
They called me
Stammerhead Shark, Lemon.

14:32.805 --> 14:33.703
What?

14:33.839 --> 14:35.272
The kids at school...
They called me names.

14:35.407 --> 14:38.399
Mrs. Stutterworth,
Stutterfingers,

14:38.544 --> 14:40.637
Stuttermilk Pancakes.

14:40.779 --> 14:42.872
The butter thing opened up
a lot of doors for them.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.243
You know, I wore
corrective shoes as a kid.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.148
Really?

14:48.287 --> 14:52.246
When I was born, I had
a malformed extra baby foot

14:52.391 --> 14:55.087
extending from my actual foot.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.956
They think
maybe I ate my twin.

14:57.096 --> 15:01.533
But after the surgery to
remove it, I walked pigeon-toed.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.066
So, all through grade school,

15:03.202 --> 15:05.397
I had to wear
corrective footgear

15:05.537 --> 15:08.597
that attached to a headgear.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.107
Gilly chewed through
his headgear.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.972
My point is, I survived.

15:13.112 --> 15:15.774
It made me a better person,
and the same is true of you.

15:15.915 --> 15:19.976
All this... all your success...
is because of that certificate.

15:20.119 --> 15:23.247
It made you who you are,
and that is not a bad thing.

15:23.389 --> 15:24.447
Thank you, Lemon.

15:25.357 --> 15:26.221
Look.

15:26.358 --> 15:28.189
The Final Council
is starting.

15:30.529 --> 15:33.692
Deborah has the bearing
of a queen.

15:35.034 --> 15:35.762
Maybe you did it!

15:35.901 --> 15:37.630
It was Josh! Why would I
do it?! That's so stupid!

15:37.770 --> 15:38.794
You know people
at "Page Six"!

15:38.938 --> 15:39.996
Since when
am I not allowed?!

15:40.139 --> 15:41.265
I hate all of you!

15:41.407 --> 15:44.103
Order! Order, I say!

15:44.243 --> 15:46.234
We must not be rash.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.812
We must divorce ourselves
from our prejudices

15:48.948 --> 15:51.508
and appeal
to our higher reasoning.

15:52.418 --> 15:53.976
This is the Speaking Banana.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.916
Everyone will get
a chance to speak,

15:56.055 --> 15:59.650
and only then
will we make our decision.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.488
Josh, my friend...

16:02.628 --> 16:04.789
you are first.

16:04.930 --> 16:09.094
Look, I would never do this,
because I'm loyal to the show.

16:09.234 --> 16:10.258
That dude did it!

16:10.402 --> 16:11.300
I knew it was you!

16:12.671 --> 16:15.196
Look at his light eyes!
They're freaky like a wolf!

16:16.275 --> 16:19.176
Hey! Keep it down!

16:19.311 --> 16:20.300
Why are you still here?

16:20.446 --> 16:23.108
I love it up here. It's hot,
it's loud, there's no pizza.

16:23.248 --> 16:24.545
It's like Miami.

16:24.683 --> 16:26.810
Maybe Liz did it.

16:26.952 --> 16:28.783
Are you kidding me?

16:28.921 --> 16:31.446
After all the times
I have defended you guys

16:31.590 --> 16:32.557
and covered up for you...

16:32.691 --> 16:34.158
How dare you accuse me?

16:34.293 --> 16:36.523
You say you're sorry right now!

16:36.662 --> 16:38.061
I'm sorry.

16:38.197 --> 16:40.188
Please don't cry.
It's making me feel weird.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.960
I can't take this anymore.

16:43.102 --> 16:45.070
I'm going to put an end
to it.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.069
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup...

16:47.206 --> 16:48.798
Mr. Donaghy, it was me.

16:48.941 --> 16:51.466
I said those bad things
about you in the newspaper, sir.

16:51.610 --> 16:52.577
Kenneth, you?

16:52.711 --> 16:54.542
I couldn't lie anymore, sir...

16:54.680 --> 16:56.511
because everyone knows
the weight of a lie

16:56.648 --> 16:59.617
makes your soul so heavy that
you can't rise up to Heaven.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.913
And you don't look good in jeans
from behind.

17:02.054 --> 17:03.180
But why, Kenneth?

17:03.322 --> 17:05.551
Is it because
I made you work late last night?

17:05.691 --> 17:07.352
Yes, sir, that was it.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.154
I was here
folding "MILF Island" T-shirts

17:09.294 --> 17:10.157
until 2:00 in the morning,

17:10.295 --> 17:11.785
and then you didn't
even offer me one.

17:11.930 --> 17:12.828
Needless to say,

17:12.964 --> 17:15.455
I grumbled about you
to anyone who would listen.

17:15.601 --> 17:18.262
I don't know what to say,
Kenneth.

17:18.404 --> 17:21.066
You've embarrassed yourself
and the show.

17:21.205 --> 17:23.606
You may have compromised my
chances of running this company.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.404
And, needless to say,
you've hurt me personally.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.614
Lemon, do you have anything
you want to add?

17:32.117 --> 17:33.880
You disgust me.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.147
Well, that's over.

17:38.290 --> 17:39.780
<i>Deborah wins!</i>

17:43.295 --> 17:45.627
<i>She played the game so well.</i>

17:45.764 --> 17:48.062
<i>She manipulated, she lied,</i>

17:48.200 --> 17:50.896
<i>she got a pretty bad
staph infection,</i>

17:51.036 --> 17:54.233
<i>but tonight
Deborah is our winner.</i>

18:00.045 --> 18:01.342
Oh.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.708
Who won?

18:02.848 --> 18:06.807
Duh-duh duh-duh-duh
duh duh duh?

18:06.952 --> 18:10.251
Na-na na-na-na?

18:10.389 --> 18:11.981
Myirt!

18:12.124 --> 18:13.386
Jack,
what are you doing here?

18:13.525 --> 18:14.992
Geiss called me.

18:15.127 --> 18:16.059
Oh, good.

18:16.195 --> 18:18.026
I never heard him
sound so happy.

18:18.163 --> 18:19.630
He called me Jackie-boy.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.290
And Deborah
is testing off the charts

18:22.434 --> 18:23.799
in the most
profitable demographics...

18:23.936 --> 18:25.665
soccer moms, NASCAR dads,

18:25.804 --> 18:27.897
white-collar pervs,
and the obese.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.507
Wow.
Congratulations.

18:29.641 --> 18:30.608
I've really come a long way

18:30.742 --> 18:31.868
since that heart attack,
haven't I?

18:32.010 --> 18:34.638
Lemon, Geiss' job
is mine to lose.

18:35.681 --> 18:38.411
There's just one thing
still bothering me.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.950
Kenneth's story
doesn't add up.

18:41.086 --> 18:42.417
You want some pizza?

18:42.554 --> 18:45.455
Kenneth said he was folding
T- shirts until 2:00 a. m.,

18:45.591 --> 18:47.650
<i>but the Post
goes to press at midnight.</i>

18:47.793 --> 18:50.523
Even if he somehow did bump
into a reporter in the elevator,

18:50.662 --> 18:51.629
it would be too late.

18:51.763 --> 18:54.288
Well, you know,
that guy's the worst.

18:54.433 --> 18:56.230
This should be
the greatest night of my life,

18:56.368 --> 18:57.266
but I can't enjoy it.

18:57.402 --> 19:00.496
I mean,
it's just k-k-killing me

19:00.639 --> 19:02.368
that somebody
would say that about me.

19:02.508 --> 19:04.703
I'm sure the person who said it
probably didn't mean it,

19:04.843 --> 19:06.435
and it was probably Toofer.

19:06.578 --> 19:08.205
No, they meant it.

19:08.347 --> 19:10.372
They think I'm a moron, just
like Gilly and everyone else.

19:10.516 --> 19:12.143
Even Gilly made fun of you?

19:12.284 --> 19:13.182
You know, it's funny, Lemon,

19:13.318 --> 19:19.655
I g-guess I'll always
b- b-be that k-k-k-k-k-k...

19:19.791 --> 19:21.952
It was me! I did it!
I didn't mean any of it!

19:22.094 --> 19:23.891
I'm sorry
I said you could eat my poo!

19:24.029 --> 19:25.587
It was me!
I did it!

19:28.333 --> 19:29.664
I know.

19:30.702 --> 19:33.170
I just wanted to get you
to admit it.

19:33.305 --> 19:34.738
And you do know

19:34.873 --> 19:36.306
how you're gonna make this up
to me, don't you?

19:36.441 --> 19:38.306
Oh, God.

19:38.443 --> 19:39.910
I got to write
the Deborah show.

19:40.045 --> 19:42.411
She wants to sing
in every episode.

19:43.448 --> 19:46.110
You knew.
How?

19:46.251 --> 19:48.185
No onion rings!

19:48.320 --> 19:50.982
Oh!
This place can eat my poo.

19:51.123 --> 19:54.354
You say that word
a lot more than you realize.

19:54.493 --> 20:00.363
Now, I need you to initial here
and sign here and here.

20:00.499 --> 20:02.899
I got to admit,
I never thought I'd get you.

20:04.503 --> 20:07.939
The stutter?
The certificate? Gilly?

20:08.073 --> 20:09.540
Yeah, well,
I made up all that stuff

20:09.675 --> 20:11.040
about the extra
baby foot, too.

20:11.176 --> 20:13.167
I made that up. That was
to make you feel better.

20:13.312 --> 20:14.404
I'll walk you out.

20:19.284 --> 20:22.412
Heel, toe, Lemon.
Heel, toe.

20:27.726 --> 20:28.784
<i>Stick around.</i>

20:28.927 --> 20:31.418
<i>Coming up next,
we've got "Dog Swap"!</i>
