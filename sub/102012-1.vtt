I'm looking in the wrong spot.</i>

00:06.373 --> 00:08.108
<i>I keep getting confused
whether I...</i>

<i>Sorry, uh, the...
The trial, yes... Um...</i>

00:15.517 --> 00:19.119
I'll admit that the feasibility
of gestating kittens

00:19.152 --> 00:21.689
in a human womb
wasn't my first choice, but...

00:22.524 --> 00:24.124
[SIGHS]

00:25.192 --> 00:27.695
It makes
people happy and...

00:27.729 --> 00:29.764
that's the most important thing.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.431

- needs must.

WOMAN: Needs must
when the devil drives.

00:38.840 --> 00:41.441
- That's the rest of the saying.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.811
WOMAN: Who is your devil,
Dr. Han?

00:43.845 --> 00:46.548
Well, I wouldn't say
there's a devil per se.

00:46.581 --> 00:48.816
WOMAN: What would you be
studying if you had the choice?

00:48.850 --> 00:52.119
Oh, human infertility solutions.

00:52.152 --> 00:53.655
That's what I specialized
in before.

00:55.557 --> 00:57.424
Before the trial.

00:57.457 --> 01:00.294
WOMAN: What prompted you
to change your...

01:00.327 --> 01:03.230
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?

01:03.263 --> 01:04.699
She told me
I could just come in.

01:07.869 --> 01:09.236
Will?

01:10.203 --> 01:12.239
Uh, no. Yes, come in.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.308
Uh, it's fine. It's...

01:17.845 --> 01:20.314
- You look well.
- DR. HAN: I, uh...

01:20.347 --> 01:21.549
Thank you.

01:21.583 --> 01:23.785
I'm glad after everything...

01:23.818 --> 01:27.287
I mean, I'm just glad you
landed on your feet.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.256
Thanks. Um...
[CLEARS THROAT]

01:29.289 --> 01:31.158
So, uh, what brings you here?

01:31.191 --> 01:33.895

you published about the trial.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.663
I'm here to apply.
[CHUCKLES]

01:35.697 --> 01:38.265
Oh, I'm sorry, Theresa.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.867
I know you like animals,

01:39.901 --> 01:42.904
but I'm afraid we already have
<i>our participants lined up.</i>

01:42.937 --> 01:46.206
[CHUCKLES] Well, I don't
wanna be in the trial,

01:46.239 --> 01:48.175
I wanna help you run it.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.877
You're gestating animals,
right?

01:49.911 --> 01:52.446
You're gonna need someone
with veterinary experience.

01:53.413 --> 01:56.416
Uh, Dr. Theresa MacKenzie...

01:57.585 --> 01:59.186
- not Blackburn?
- No,

01:59.219 --> 02:01.321
- I went back to my maiden name.
- DR. HAN: Oh.

02:02.422 --> 02:05.593
Ugh, I'm sorry, Theresa.

02:05.627 --> 02:07.695
I really appreciate you
coming out, but...

02:07.729 --> 02:10.732
I'm afraid that
it wouldn't be appropriate.

02:10.764 --> 02:13.300
I know we have a history,

02:13.333 --> 02:15.503
and some of it is not optimal,

02:15.536 --> 02:17.572
but well,
I just wanted to see you,

02:17.605 --> 02:20.474
you know,
and I tried calling you,

02:20.508 --> 02:21.609
but you wouldn't pick up.

02:21.643 --> 02:23.778
And this is the only path
you left open.

02:25.345 --> 02:26.881
I really missed you too.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.482
Well, it's just...

02:28.516 --> 02:32.185
We already have
a vet tech on staff.

02:32.787 --> 02:34.522
Oh!

02:34.555 --> 02:36.390
I really am very sorry.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.760
It's okay.
I can see myself out.

[HAN SIGHING]

02:50.972 --> 02:52.507
My apologies, ladies.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.307
I'm Dr. William Han.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.309
I will be
facilitating this trial.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.246
Has everyone had a chance to...
find the coffee?

02:59.279 --> 03:01.582
Oh, yeah. Got two cups.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.818
Is it normal to have
shaking hands at this point?

03:03.851 --> 03:05.920
Oh, okay.
Someone just cut me off.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.822
- Please take that away.
- Thank you.

03:08.523 --> 03:09.423
Thank you.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.358
Okay. Well,
let's get down to business.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.995
Has everyone had a chance
to read over the contract?

03:14.028 --> 03:16.531
- Yes.
- Yeah.

03:16.564 --> 03:20.300
Basically, the agreement is
you four will be participating

03:20.333 --> 03:22.469
in a three month medical
trial, during which time

03:22.503 --> 03:24.806
you will be impregnated
with a cat fetus

03:24.839 --> 03:26.373
and carry it to term.

03:26.406 --> 03:27.642
Once you've given birth,

03:27.675 --> 03:29.309
you'll be paid $20,000.

03:29.342 --> 03:30.745
And if everything
checks out,

03:30.778 --> 03:33.280
be able to keep the kitten.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.783
Does anyone have any concerns
they'd like to bring up?

03:35.817 --> 03:37.284
Yes. Mrs. LaPointe.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.654
Since we're only
carrying one fetus,

03:39.687 --> 03:41.022
are we gonna show much?

03:41.055 --> 03:45.325
No. The average weight of a
newborn kitten is about 100 grams.

03:45.358 --> 03:47.895
- That's about the size of a bar of soap.
- Awesome.

03:47.929 --> 03:49.897
WOMAN: <i>Why did I want to
take part in the trial?</i>

03:49.931 --> 03:53.835
Well, my husband and I
talked about having another kid

03:53.868 --> 03:57.004
but a cat just seemed easier.

03:57.038 --> 03:59.272
Don't get me wrong.
I love my kids. I do.

03:59.306 --> 04:01.943
But they are a lot.

04:01.976 --> 04:04.946
Amen, sister.
Roll up your sleeve.

04:04.979 --> 04:08.549
[CLEARS THROAT] Like Tom and I
work from home, and that's great

04:08.583 --> 04:09.917
in terms of not having to
pay for childcare,

04:09.951 --> 04:11.753
but it's just not so great
in terms of,

04:11.786 --> 04:14.922
they just seem to get in
every space that they're in.

04:14.956 --> 04:17.257
Just wait until they're 28, and
they don't leave the basement.

04:18.659 --> 04:19.761
Little poke.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.063
Anyway, um,

04:22.096 --> 04:24.999
I just thought it would be nice
for the boys to have a pet

04:25.032 --> 04:27.334
to play with, you know.
Teach them some responsibility,

04:27.367 --> 04:28.903
and keep them entertained and,

04:28.936 --> 04:30.905
keep them out of our hair.

04:30.938 --> 04:34.374
Oh, and also, we get to go to
Disneyland with the money.

04:34.407 --> 04:35.977
Just like we always wanted.

04:36.010 --> 04:38.813
20,000, you might be able to
stay there for the whole day.

04:41.549 --> 04:44.384
However, your uterus is
a little bit bigger than a cat.

04:44.417 --> 04:46.754
So, there's a possibility
the kitten might grow bigger.

04:46.788 --> 04:49.624
But to the untrained eye,
you will not be visibly pregnant.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.425
That's great, because in
subsection A,

04:52.459 --> 04:54.662
in paragraph four, it does say
we're to keep our condition

04:54.695 --> 04:56.964
a secret, except for the adult
members of our households

04:56.998 --> 04:59.033
who are willing to sign a
non-disclosure agreement

04:59.066 --> 05:01.602
on pain of forfeiting the entire
stipend for the trial.

05:01.636 --> 05:02.837
DR. HAN: That's correct,
Ms. Castellano.

05:02.870 --> 05:06.439
And did you know that one in
18 Canadian hospital patients,

05:06.473 --> 05:08.441
experience harm from
preventable errors

05:08.475 --> 05:09.710
due to the medical staff?

05:09.744 --> 05:11.444
Amateurs.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.549
You really try, you can get it
up to one in five.

05:14.582 --> 05:17.084
Okay. I'm gonna need you
to put down the syringe

05:17.118 --> 05:19.787
because I consented to blood
draws today. Not an injection.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.423
Fine. Spoilsport.

05:24.424 --> 05:25.993
All right kid. Give me your arm.

Anyway. Sorry. Where was I?

05:28.428 --> 05:30.131
Oh, why am I doing the trial?

- Money.
- Yes!

glued onto my basement couch.

- What about you?
- Law school.

05:46.013 --> 05:48.115
Why don't you just
leech off your parents?

05:48.149 --> 05:49.784
All the cool kids are doing it.

05:49.817 --> 05:53.588
Oh, Dad's dead and mom,
let's just say she...

05:53.621 --> 05:56.724
Is not keen on having
a lawyer in the family.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.391
What, is she from Bizarro World?

05:58.425 --> 06:00.695
Just wait. You'll see.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.998
Oh wait!
We can't tell anybody?

06:05.666 --> 06:09.637
I tell everybody everything.
That's like my job.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.706
Can you explain to
the old guy how a vlog works?

06:11.739 --> 06:13.708
- Miss Prescott?
- Rose. Thank you.

06:13.741 --> 06:16.010
I'm not like some
spinster aunt or anything.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.479
Well, okay, maybe I'm
heading in that direction.

06:19.513 --> 06:22.583
Rose, I can assure you
that 46 is

06:22.617 --> 06:25.452
plenty young enough to be
familiar with YouTube.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.822
And I'm aware that you make
your career online.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.524
Now I'm not asking you to
keep it a secret forever.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.994
Just until the trial is over.

06:33.027 --> 06:36.496
You should feel free to record
your impressions for later posts

06:36.530 --> 06:41.135
but I'm gonna have to ask all of
you for complete confidentiality

06:41.168 --> 06:43.537
so that we don't skew
the results of the trial.

06:43.571 --> 06:47.008
Um, if this is supposed to be
such a big secret,

06:47.041 --> 06:48.910
why is there a TV crew?

06:48.943 --> 06:51.879
Why did I want to do the trial?
It's a good question.

06:51.913 --> 06:54.515
My fiancee loves cats, but

06:54.548 --> 06:58.686
if I'm being honest, it's partly a
way to appease my mom a little bit.

06:58.719 --> 07:02.089
She wants me to have human kids,

07:02.123 --> 07:03.291
not cats. But...

07:03.324 --> 07:06.027
This is a much as Jennifer and I
are willing to compromise.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.628
I'm sure she'll be thrilled.

07:07.662 --> 07:11.933
Or the reason is that it be nice
to have $20,000.

07:11.966 --> 07:13.801
Our wedding's
in six months,

07:13.834 --> 07:16.103
and damn,
that stuff is not cheap.

07:16.137 --> 07:18.806
Even with Jennifer's company
doing the catering at cost,

07:18.839 --> 07:20.473
yikes!

07:20.508 --> 07:22.576
And my mom is really religious.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.813
So she wants the full spread,
the church, the dinner reception

07:25.846 --> 07:28.783
in the works and
our family is huge.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.251
Look on the bright side.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.520
If you're super religious mother
finds out you let a doctor

07:32.553 --> 07:34.487
turkey baste a kitten
into your womb,

07:34.522 --> 07:36.924

mouths to feed at your shindig.

One moment, please.

Professional cat lady.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.815
The reason
I'm doing the trial is,

08:00.848 --> 08:03.184
Mr. Poof and I,
he's my cat.

08:06.721 --> 08:09.290
We've been thinking about adding
another full time

08:09.323 --> 08:10.257
member to our family
for a while now.

08:10.291 --> 08:12.727
And this is just a great
opportunity to have

08:12.760 --> 08:14.862
one who's like, really ours,
you know?

08:14.895 --> 08:17.932
I mean, Mr. Poof,
he donated his genetic material,

08:17.965 --> 08:20.568
so it's just gonna be so special
to have our own little kitten.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.204
Wait, so, you are literally
having your own cat's baby?

08:23.237 --> 08:25.906
Yeah. I mean,
he's like my life.

08:26.741 --> 08:28.809
Anyways, we're also
hoping to expand

08:28.843 --> 08:30.945
our fostering operation in...

08:30.978 --> 08:33.813
into a full-blown
adoption center.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.283
And with the
$20,000 and...

08:36.317 --> 08:39.553
whatever donations we get from
the publicity of the trial,

08:40.587 --> 08:42.155
uh, we should be
able to do that.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.225
Then you could become a crazy
cat lady for real.

08:44.258 --> 08:45.860
Damn straight.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.095
And only then can you call me
Ms. Prescott.

08:49.230 --> 08:51.599
FTV,
the feline television network,

08:51.632 --> 08:53.768
has graciously agreed
to partially fund

08:53.801 --> 08:57.972
this trial in exchange for
exclusive documentary rights.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.740
But due to editing and
processing time,

08:59.774 --> 09:02.276
the documentary won't be
released until several months

09:02.309 --> 09:03.711
after the trial,

09:03.744 --> 09:07.948
at which point you should have
settled back into your regular lives.

09:07.982 --> 09:10.684
I trust this shouldn't be
a problem for any of you.

09:12.086 --> 09:14.722
Okay, well,

09:14.755 --> 09:16.323
please sign

09:18.993 --> 09:20.895
will take you into the
examination room

09:20.928 --> 09:24.098
one of the time and run
your initial bloodwork.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.934
- What's up, guinea pigs.
- Uh, Pauline...

09:27.735 --> 09:30.037
I thought,
we agree that patients

09:30.071 --> 09:33.140
was the preferred nomenclature
for the participants

09:33.174 --> 09:36.343
- of our trial.
- Whoops.

09:36.377 --> 09:39.847
So which one of you
wants to get stabbed first?

09:39.880 --> 09:43.184
Why did I want to do this
trial? One word: money.

09:43.217 --> 09:45.920
I don't give a shit
about cat gestation.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.688
Tyler, Your turn.

09:48.322 --> 09:49.890
Uh, me?

09:50.791 --> 09:52.793
My name is...

09:52.827 --> 09:55.229
Tyler Ferguson.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.899
I work for Dr Han. Like...

09:58.933 --> 10:00.634
Doing the cat stuff.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.107
What was the question again?

10:06.140 --> 10:07.942
CAMERAMAN: Why do you wanna
work on this trial?

Hey. I see you brought
the camera crew. Hi, guys.

Sorry about the mess. Just put
anything anywhere you find some room.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.104
By the way, Mom, you know,
I prefer it when you call me Joan.

10:37.138 --> 10:38.739
Yes, I do know that.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.441
But your father and I
called you Joan Jett,

10:40.474 --> 10:42.209
so that we could call you Jett.

10:42.243 --> 10:44.245
Joan was just
to please his mother.

SUNSHINE: Honey,
law school is just not for you.

11:08.135 --> 11:11.272
We talked about this.
Those graduate schools just

11:11.305 --> 11:13.107
stifle your creativity.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.975
I'm not creative.

11:15.009 --> 11:16.410
I don't have
a creative bone in my body.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.279
I'm not gonna make
a living in the arts.

First of all,
you don't know that.

11:20.848 --> 11:23.317
And secondly,
it's what your father wanted.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.452
JOAN:
He wanted me to have choices.

11:25.486 --> 11:27.788
Can you just help me
out a little bit?

11:27.821 --> 11:30.391
I know that dad left money
for my education.

11:30.424 --> 11:32.359
Yeah, sure. Of course.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.363
Okay. Amazing.

11:36.397 --> 11:39.300
SUNSHINE: I mean, as long
as you're going to art school.

11:39.333 --> 11:42.469
Honey, your father fought
long and hard against

11:42.504 --> 11:47.509
his conservative family so that
he could make a career in art,

11:47.542 --> 11:49.944

you throw all of that away

11:49.977 --> 11:53.113

have some high paying job.

where Joan's headed right now?

12:21.141 --> 12:23.511
Oh, yeah.

She doesn't really know
what she wants yet.

she'll figure it out, though.

would be the first one in line.

that the THC

to have babies.

30:57.592 --> 30:59.993
For my birthday,
she bought me a book.

31:00.027 --> 31:01.663
<i>The Joys of Fertilization.</i>

31:01.696 --> 31:03.531
MARIA: <i>I don't know how
she'll react to the pregnancy,</i>

31:03.565 --> 31:05.332
but it doesn't matter, right?

31:05.366 --> 31:07.468
Because the whole
thing is a secret.

31:07.501 --> 31:10.137
We can just tell her we
adopted it from a shelter.

31:10.170 --> 31:13.173
I don't know if Maria forgets that
this is going to air eventually,

31:13.207 --> 31:15.376
but hell might
actually freeze over

31:15.409 --> 31:17.545
before Gabby is cool
with her childless daughter

31:17.579 --> 31:20.080
poppin' a kitten
out of her lady garden.

31:20.114 --> 31:23.951
ROSE: Oh, Mr. Poof, it's already over
1,000 comments on our last video.

31:23.984 --> 31:24.918
Here let's see.

31:24.952 --> 31:27.087
Oh, this is a pretty
representative sample.

31:27.121 --> 31:29.289
Okay, Catlover281,

31:29.323 --> 31:34.094
"I would give every dollar I own to give
birth to my own squadorable kittens!"

31:34.128 --> 31:35.496
Oh, my God. [CHUCKLING]

31:35.530 --> 31:39.233
See? And then there's this row of
emojis with hearts for the eyes.

31:39.266 --> 31:40.702
Aww!

31:40.735 --> 31:43.404
Oh, this one...
This one, Poofs, right?

31:43.437 --> 31:45.305
Anonymous.

31:45.339 --> 31:46.974
"If I could go back
and do it again,

31:47.007 --> 31:49.376
"I would have kittens
instead of kids.

31:49.410 --> 31:52.479
"I love my kids as people,
but I only had them because everybody said

31:52.514 --> 31:55.249
"I should do it before
I got too old or I'd regret it.

31:55.282 --> 31:57.585
"But now, my husband and I haven't
been on a date in six years,

31:57.619 --> 32:00.087
"I'm chronically sleep-deprived,
and everyone knows me now

32:00.120 --> 32:02.356
"as my kid's mom
instead of my own person.

32:02.389 --> 32:05.025
"I think I ruined
my life."

32:05.058 --> 32:08.395
Shit, that's some
heavy stuff, man.

32:08.429 --> 32:10.565
Man, that is such
bullshit, you know?

32:10.598 --> 32:11.733
I mean, if people
don't wanna have kids,

32:11.766 --> 32:13.200
then they shouldn't
have to have kids.

32:13.233 --> 32:16.036
Like get your brains
out of the 1950s, people!

32:16.069 --> 32:18.105
That's one of the reasons
this trial is so important.

32:18.138 --> 32:21.241
I know that it seems like this goofy
vanity project at first glance,

32:21.275 --> 32:23.477
but that shit is all about
looking good for somebody else,

32:23.511 --> 32:25.179
because there's just
this idea that it's women,

32:25.212 --> 32:26.681
that's what we're
supposed to do.

32:26.714 --> 32:29.416
But this isn't for anybody
else, this is for us.

32:29.450 --> 32:32.219
And more choices for women
is always a good idea.

32:32.252 --> 32:34.021
[FARTS]

32:34.054 --> 32:37.090
Traitor! Your farts are way
worse, you stink demon!

32:39.059 --> 32:40.461
Can you just edit
the last bit out?

32:40.494 --> 32:44.064
I'm sorry, I just feel like I took
the sting out of my rant there.

32:44.398 --> 32:45.432
Thank you.

32:47.201 --> 32:50.538
Hey, sweetie, you look like
you can use this.

32:51.773 --> 32:53.440
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

32:55.743 --> 32:57.512
So,

32:57.545 --> 32:59.547
what's up?
What happened?

33:01.181 --> 33:03.183
I got turned down for a loan.

33:03.685 --> 33:04.686
Oh.

33:07.120 --> 33:08.121
I'm sorry.

33:10.658 --> 33:12.727
You know what, babe?
Maybe it's for the best.

33:14.294 --> 33:15.697
No, it's not for the best.

33:15.730 --> 33:17.699
[SOBBING]

33:17.732 --> 33:20.334
I really, really wanna
go to law school.

33:20.668 --> 33:22.169
[SOBBING]

33:23.337 --> 33:25.640
Look, can you just...

33:25.673 --> 33:27.207
You don't have to
give me Dad's money,

33:27.241 --> 33:29.409
but can you just
co-sign with me for a loan,

33:29.443 --> 33:32.045
so that I can do it and...

33:32.079 --> 33:33.581
And I'll pay you back

33:33.615 --> 33:35.583
or I'll... I'll pay it myself.

33:37.484 --> 33:38.485
Wow.

33:40.087 --> 33:41.288
You seem really determined.

33:41.321 --> 33:42.790
I am. [CHUCKLING]

33:44.258 --> 33:45.259
Like,

33:46.561 --> 33:49.429
how can I make you understand?

33:49.463 --> 33:51.766
Sweetie, I feel the same way.

33:51.799 --> 33:55.369
I mean, how can I
make you understand?

33:55.402 --> 34:00.542
Do you know how free
and fulfilled you will feel

34:00.575 --> 34:04.077
if you just
let yourself try art?

34:04.846 --> 34:07.582
[SIGHING] Okay.
[SNIFFLES]

34:07.615 --> 34:12.351
If I tried art and I
was terrible at it,

34:12.386 --> 34:17.725
then would you then co-sign
with me for a loan, please?

34:17.759 --> 34:21.460
[CHUCKLES] Okay,
well, if you tried it,

34:21.495 --> 34:23.630
and you had no talent,
whatsoever...

34:23.665 --> 34:26.199
Okay, then it's a deal.

34:28.735 --> 34:30.370
- Sincerely try it?
- Yes.

34:31.338 --> 34:32.639
But you have to
shake on it.

34:35.409 --> 34:36.744
- You promise?
- I promise.

34:36.777 --> 34:39.246
Okay. Yes!

34:39.279 --> 34:43.150
All right, so now,
we're talkin'!

34:43.183 --> 34:45.152
All right, I got a list here.

34:45.185 --> 34:46.554
Here we go.

34:46.588 --> 34:50.324
There's a paint night tomorrow,
a knitathon on Saturday.

34:50.357 --> 34:53.293
Ooh, we'll go to a weaving
workshop next weekend.

34:53.327 --> 34:57.665
[GASPING] And pottery.
Oh, you'll love that class.

34:57.699 --> 35:00.768
Okay, this is crazy,
paint by numbers, however...

35:03.270 --> 35:05.272
DR. HAN: So, week two, ladies.

35:05.305 --> 35:06.507
How is everyone feeling?

35:06.541 --> 35:10.210
Nauseated at the worst times
and not in the morning either.

35:10.243 --> 35:11.646
I thought this was called
"morning sickness".

35:11.679 --> 35:14.849
I know, right? I've been moaning
and groaning like a little old lady.

35:14.882 --> 35:16.818
My back is killing me
and it can't be the kitten.

35:16.851 --> 35:18.653
It... it's like the size
of a gumdrop.

35:18.686 --> 35:21.288
Oh my God, I would kill
for gumdrop right now,

35:21.321 --> 35:24.424
but I would stink up
this entire room.

35:24.458 --> 35:26.326
Mr. Poof won't even
sleep with me anymore.

35:26.360 --> 35:27.461
- [CHUCKLING]
- ROSE: What the heck?

35:27.494 --> 35:29.296
- I don't have a kitten in my bowels.
- [CHUCKLING]

35:29.329 --> 35:32.867
I can so tell you guys have
never been pregnant before.

35:32.900 --> 35:35.870
My head's killing me and my
moods are all over the place,

35:35.903 --> 35:38.271
so if Tom even sneezes
at the wrong moment,

35:38.305 --> 35:40.742
I'm just... I'm liable
to rip his head off.

35:40.775 --> 35:42.476
But that's par for
the course for me.

35:42.510 --> 35:45.445
I smashed an entire dish set
when I was pregnant with Jaden.

35:45.479 --> 35:47.515
Wait, no, so this is normal?

35:47.548 --> 35:49.951
I'm afraid so. All the symptoms
you guys have been describing

35:49.984 --> 35:53.487
are common in both feline
and human pregnancies.

35:53.521 --> 35:55.757
Now, some of the symptoms
may abate as the pregnancy

35:55.790 --> 35:59.326
progresses or stay
the same or get worse.

35:59.359 --> 36:02.597
So you're basically saying that you
have no idea what's gonna happen.

36:02.630 --> 36:05.733
This is an experiment.
We're trying to find out what's happening.

36:05.767 --> 36:09.269
Uh, if you want a resource,
I printed out a handout

36:09.302 --> 36:13.173
of the common symptoms during
each stage of the pregnancy.

36:14.542 --> 36:20.247
Fever, swollen boobs,
uh, constipation, random crying.

36:20.280 --> 36:21.849
And people wonder why
I don't wanna have kids.

36:21.883 --> 36:23.417
It ain't for the faint of
heart, that's for sure.

36:23.450 --> 36:27.387
[SIGHS] I don't see it on here,
but does anybody else get a weird impulse

36:27.421 --> 36:29.389
- to drink milk out of the dish?
- [CHUCKLING]

36:29.423 --> 36:30.992
No, I'm dead serious.

36:31.025 --> 36:33.460
Page 3, food cravings.

36:33.493 --> 36:35.763
Oh, shit.
Maybe that's why I wanted to

36:35.797 --> 36:37.765
rub up against my mom
when she was cooking fish.

36:37.799 --> 36:39.466
- No.
- Okay, this is weird.

36:39.499 --> 36:41.234
- [CHUCKLING]
- This is really weird.

36:41.268 --> 36:44.005
- SYLVIA: That's not normal.
- Excuse me, this is... Darryl?

36:44.038 --> 36:44.906
- DARRYL: Hi, Theresa.
- Who's that?

36:44.939 --> 36:46.206
- How did you get in?
- I know the super.

36:46.239 --> 36:50.477
Yeah, now you don't.
This is a private clinic. You get lost.

36:52.479 --> 36:54.582
Can't prevent me from
speaking to my own wife, Han.

36:54.615 --> 36:56.784
Well, maybe I can't,
but the restraining order can.

36:56.818 --> 36:58.786
Ex. Ex-wife, Darryl.

36:58.820 --> 37:01.823
You have no right to show up
here and interfere with my life!

37:01.856 --> 37:03.290
- Yeah.
- Tell him.

37:03.323 --> 37:05.827
And there are serious consequences
to breaching a restraining order!

37:05.860 --> 37:07.628
You heard her.
Beat it.

37:09.831 --> 37:11.132
This isn't over.

37:11.165 --> 37:14.501
I will not have you interfering
in our marriage any longer.

37:21.876 --> 37:23.243
Oh, I'm so sorry, everyone.

37:23.276 --> 37:27.347
It's not your fault. Only Darryl's
responsible for his own actions.

37:27.380 --> 37:29.517
- What he said.
- Yeah, this is not on you.

37:29.550 --> 37:30.818
What a little wiener, though.

37:30.852 --> 37:32.687
- Oh.
- And I can definitely help you

37:32.720 --> 37:34.454
report this to
the police if you want.

37:34.488 --> 37:37.959
Thanks, everyone.
I think I just wanna go home.

37:37.992 --> 37:41.929
I think I'm gonna have a nice
civil conversation with our super.

37:46.734 --> 37:48.069
I'm so sorry.

37:48.102 --> 37:49.604
Hey, it's okay.

37:50.938 --> 37:54.008
Oh, he's cute.
Is this from the sew-a-thon?

37:54.041 --> 37:55.643
Yeah.

37:55.676 --> 37:57.678
Do you think your mom
would make me one?

37:57.712 --> 38:00.515
Oh God. If you tell
her you like her stuff,

38:00.548 --> 38:02.617
she will not stop
making you stuff.

38:02.650 --> 38:03.684
It's perfect.

38:05.553 --> 38:06.788
What about that one?

38:06.821 --> 38:08.523
Oh, this?

38:08.556 --> 38:10.958
It's my attempt at a cat.

38:10.992 --> 38:12.894
- Hate to break it to you...
- [SIGHS]

38:12.927 --> 38:13.961
That I have no talent?

38:13.995 --> 38:15.963
- I wasn't gonna say that.
- Yeah, it's shit, I know.

38:15.997 --> 38:18.032
[CHUCKLING]

38:18.065 --> 38:21.936
Trust me, I know.
It's just my mom you need to convince.

38:21.969 --> 38:24.772
Okay, anyway, so how
does this sound?

38:24.806 --> 38:29.911
For sale, one purebred
hypoallergenic kitten, price $1,500.

38:29.944 --> 38:32.445
You just... You can't just say purebred
though, you have to see the breed.

38:32.479 --> 38:34.115
Okay, what's the breed?

38:34.148 --> 38:35.616
It's Maine Coon.

38:35.650 --> 38:38.953
Okay, "One purebred
hypoallergenic

38:38.986 --> 38:41.856
"Maine Coon kitten,
price $1,500."

38:41.889 --> 38:45.026
Price is a bit high, but people are
crazy, someone will go for it.

38:45.059 --> 38:46.727
But you also have to
say when it's available,

38:46.761 --> 38:49.429
otherwise people are gonna think
that you have it now.

38:49.462 --> 38:53.067
Right. Uh, okay,
"Available in two months."

38:53.100 --> 38:54.535
Is that a weird amount of time?

38:54.569 --> 38:56.436
How long are cats
even pregnant for?

38:56.469 --> 38:57.705
Eight weeks.

38:57.738 --> 38:59.941
So basically putting it up there
as soon as you got knocked up.

39:00.775 --> 39:01.776
Cool.

39:04.078 --> 39:05.880
Are you sure you want to
give them away, Joan?

39:07.582 --> 39:09.784
I'm not giving it away,
I'm selling it.

39:09.817 --> 39:11.219
And yes, I'm sure.

39:11.252 --> 39:15.756
Besides tuition down payments are
due in a couple of months and...

39:15.790 --> 39:17.792
my mom is not gonna
come around any time soon.

39:17.825 --> 39:20.595
- [SIGHING]
- Well, we can always do a GoFundMe or something.

39:20.628 --> 39:22.395
You have choices
if you want them.

39:22.429 --> 39:24.599
I know. I know.

39:24.632 --> 39:27.500
But I know what I want,
and what I don't want,

39:27.535 --> 39:32.006
and you know, I'll pet other people's
cats, but I don't want one for keeps.

39:32.039 --> 39:36.443
Besides, how many people
out there would love to have it?

39:36.476 --> 39:38.713
It'll just have a much better
home with somebody else.

39:38.746 --> 39:40.815
Fair enough.
[CHUCKLING]

39:40.848 --> 39:42.617
Oh,

39:42.650 --> 39:44.785
maybe we can
sell him next.

39:45.586 --> 39:47.154
- No.
- Okay.

39:51.859 --> 39:53.060
[CHUCKLING]

39:53.094 --> 39:56.197
We have a dishwasher,
you don't need to wash 'em by hand.

39:56.230 --> 40:00.534
The dishwasher doesn't do
a great job of caked-on food.

40:00.568 --> 40:03.738
Sometimes you need to prewash,
sometimes you need to scrub.

40:04.672 --> 40:07.074
Okay, whatever you say.

40:11.212 --> 40:12.513
You're making a mess.

40:15.149 --> 40:18.019
Oh, I'm sorry.

40:21.889 --> 40:24.625
I'm just gonna warn you that
I'm feeling very hormonal today

40:24.659 --> 40:26.594
and I cannot guarantee
the safety of any limbs

40:26.627 --> 40:28.696
that encroach my personal space.

[EXHALES SHARPLY]

40:35.136 --> 40:36.237
- Ugh.
- Do you wanna do it?

40:36.270 --> 40:37.538
You know what?
I wouldn't mind.

40:37.571 --> 40:41.208
Okay, then I will just go and I'll...
I'll fold some laundry

40:41.242 --> 40:43.077
Oh, uh...

40:44.145 --> 40:45.513
What?

40:45.546 --> 40:47.114
[SIGHING]

40:48.015 --> 40:49.050
It's just

40:49.717 --> 40:52.620
I have never been comfortable

40:52.653 --> 40:54.588
with the way that
you fold socks.

40:58.626 --> 40:59.627
Okay,

41:00.995 --> 41:02.196
I'm going upstairs.

41:02.229 --> 41:03.898
[EXHALES]

41:16.978 --> 41:19.180
Tom does so much around the house.
[CHUCKLING]

I always laugh when
my girlfriends complain

that their husbands
put away one dish

You were a scout?

42:02.723 --> 42:04.191
I was a brownie

42:04.225 --> 42:06.260
for three weeks
in the second grade

42:06.293 --> 42:09.663
and mom made me quit when I
brought a raccoon home from camp.

It's one thing to say

43:31.045 --> 43:34.014
you're going to pioneer a procedure
to bring people happiness,

43:34.048 --> 43:36.383

look in their eyes,

it's had on their lives.

give yourself permission

That's a bit steeper than the other

44:32.439 --> 44:34.375
Uh, well, you know,
that may be true,

44:34.408 --> 44:36.076
but you know, you're gonna
get your money's worth,

44:36.110 --> 44:38.179
because the kitten
is hypoallergenic.

Oh, that'll be great
for your hay fever, huh?

44:41.148 --> 44:43.450
It's really expensive.

44:43.484 --> 44:45.753
How many kittens are you
expecting from the litter?

44:45.786 --> 44:47.421
Maybe we could take
the runt at a discount.

44:47.454 --> 44:51.825
Um, uh, actually, there's only
one kitten available at this time.

44:51.859 --> 44:52.993

something like that. Mm-hm.

You don't have any
breeder credentials at all.

45:03.538 --> 45:05.306
Will there be a certificate
with the kitten?

I don't have any credentials to show you,

45:08.442 --> 45:12.179

everything is above board

45:12.213 --> 45:17.519
and um, I can get you a certificate with
all of that information on there. So...

45:17.552 --> 45:19.521
Well, I'll have to
at least inspect the dame

45:19.554 --> 45:21.922
and the sire as well
if possible. [CHUCKLES]

I have an ultrasound photo.

Yeah, I don't really know what to make
of Tom's non-allergic reaction to Jinxy.

47:17.971 --> 47:20.274
I mean, he always claimed
he was too allergic

47:20.307 --> 47:22.910
even for those supposedly
hypoallergenic cats,

47:22.943 --> 47:26.113

something to do with their saliva, so...

he lied about being allergic?

47:28.550 --> 47:31.218
What? Tom?
No, because no,

47:31.251 --> 47:33.987
he's practically perfect,
so he would never do anything like that.

47:34.656 --> 47:36.123
No.

No, it's probably
more like he...

we met and that was
15 years ago.

47:43.698 --> 47:48.302

is, because he was as a kid.

I... I mean, anyway,
it's a good thing, right?

47:50.070 --> 47:53.340
Because if he liked Jinxy,
he's gonna love our kitten.

your illicit tit pics,

anything because it's not real life.

of illicit tit pics to protect?
