roasted head

to that kitchen.

influence you have never had.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.679
You are gonna March

03:33.681 --> 03:35.380
Over to that sofa
right now

03:35.382 --> 03:36.748
And you're gonna sit down

03:36.750 --> 03:39.718
Because you are in a time-out.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.155
(chuckles) I'm sorry. Did you
just put me on a time-out?

03:43.157 --> 03:45.924
You do realize
I'm not seven, right?

03:45.926 --> 03:48.160
Let's review the facts,
shall we?

03:48.162 --> 03:49.595
You have been
utterly powerless

03:49.597 --> 03:51.096
To protect us from
the red devil.

03:51.098 --> 03:53.832
Hmm. Sort of a strange
coincidence, isn't it?

03:53.834 --> 03:56.235
Seeing as how your primary
motivation as dean

03:56.237 --> 03:58.270
Of this school has been
to shut down kappa house.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.672
Well, behold how
badly you've failed.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.507
Kappa house is alive

04:02.509 --> 04:05.110
And well,
and it's your university

04:05.112 --> 04:07.079
That's been shut down.

04:07.081 --> 04:10.015
I think it's pretty safe to
assume that your career is over.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.383
Now, if you'll
excuse us,

04:11.385 --> 04:14.086

of our fellow

04:16.724 --> 04:18.390

ill-thought-out purchases

04:20.794 --> 04:24.696

can't afford and don't need.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.899

would be un-american.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.401
Let's go, sluts.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.136
Try not to murder
anyone else while we're gone,

04:31.138 --> 04:33.205
Dean carpetmunsch.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.647
Man: I want to know what
I'm being charged with.

04:41.649 --> 04:42.981
Officer:
You drove your pickup truck

04:42.983 --> 04:44.650
Through the front window
of a best buy.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.385
You killed or maimed
40 people. Let's go.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.988
Grace: Where do you think
his office is?

04:50.891 --> 04:53.225
Detective!

04:53.227 --> 04:54.559
We called to report
another murder,

04:54.561 --> 04:55.994
But no one has come
to check about it yet.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.797
You know it's the busiest night
of a cop's year, right?

04:58.799 --> 04:59.798
Every available man's
working the retail beat.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.266
Well, what about you?

05:01.268 --> 05:03.168
My girlfriend was murdered.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.503
The killer cut her head off

05:04.505 --> 05:06.171
And tried to serve it to us
for thanksgiving.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.006
Sounds awful,

05:08.008 --> 05:09.675
But I'd keep that to yourself.

05:09.677 --> 05:10.942
Pretty much always,

05:10.944 --> 05:14.012
The boyfriend's
the prime suspect.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.181
Oh. Well, I was
about to break up with her.

05:16.183 --> 05:17.849
I mean, she was
driving me nuts.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.018
You're not really
helping yourself.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.187
You guys are wasting your time
talking to me.

05:22.189 --> 05:23.355
I was just fired.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.457
They fired the entire
homicide department

05:25.459 --> 05:26.792
And the chief of police.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.660
Most of the uniformed cops
out there are working

05:28.662 --> 05:31.296
On a-a volunteer basis because
they get backed up inside

05:31.298 --> 05:33.198
If they don't
crack a few skulls every day.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.833
Okay, h-how can they
fire everyone?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.134
Well...

05:36.136 --> 05:38.603
The mayor got pretty pissed
that we had zero leads

05:38.605 --> 05:39.705
On that whole red devil thing

05:39.707 --> 05:41.773
And we spent our
budget for the month

05:41.775 --> 05:43.442
On the ghost hunting supplies.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.544
There's a killer on the loose
and you're telling us

05:45.546 --> 05:47.512
This town has no police force?

05:47.514 --> 05:49.147
Oh, oh, don't get
too worked up about it.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.982
They're interviewing
some tip-top candidates

05:50.984 --> 05:52.284
Right now as we speak

05:52.286 --> 05:54.052
To take over. And, uh,

05:54.054 --> 05:57.222
I'm opening my own
interior design company.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.324
So if any of you need some

05:59.326 --> 06:01.360
Interiors designed...

06:01.362 --> 06:03.128
It's always been my dream.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.296
Well...

06:04.298 --> 06:07.065
If you guys'll excuse me...

06:07.067 --> 06:09.368
I got a lot more packing to do.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.573
Should I get number five a pair
of 99-cent brass studs

06:14.575 --> 06:17.642
That'll turn her earlobes green
and give her an infection

06:17.644 --> 06:20.078
Or a pair of $1.99 danglies

06:20.080 --> 06:22.981
That'll get caught on her
sweater and tear her earholes?

06:22.983 --> 06:24.549
Hmm. That's a really good
question.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.151
Okay, you know
what, you guys,

06:26.153 --> 06:28.186
I don't understand why you have
to get us the crappiest gifts

06:28.188 --> 06:30.355
Possible and then make sure
we know about it beforehand

06:30.357 --> 06:32.424
Just to ruin the surprise.

06:32.426 --> 06:35.260
Um, hello? The surprise is that
you're getting anything at all.

06:35.262 --> 06:36.428
You guys
should be happy

06:36.430 --> 06:37.929
You're even on my radar.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.165
I think what number five is
trying to say is that since

06:40.167 --> 06:42.234
We spent so much time and money
picking you out the perfect

06:42.236 --> 06:44.002
Chanel classic flap crocodile
jumbo purse for you...

06:44.004 --> 06:46.071
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:46.073 --> 06:49.274
You dumb bitches got me--
chanel--

06:49.276 --> 06:51.276
A chanel classic flap
crocodile purse?

06:51.278 --> 06:52.444
Oh, yeah.

06:52.446 --> 06:53.879
That is bizarre.
I mean, that's like

06:53.881 --> 06:55.447
Bringing pineapples to hawaii.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.082
You know uncle karl

06:57.084 --> 06:59.618
Gives me chanel swag
for free, right?

06:59.620 --> 07:02.421
So why would you feel the need
to waste $13,000

07:02.423 --> 07:04.289
Buying me something
I already have?

07:04.291 --> 07:07.192
'cause it's christmas.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.728
Oh, my god.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.063
Maybe I've got this
whole black Friday thing wrong.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.365
Maybe instead of using
my disgusting wealth

07:13.367 --> 07:14.599
To buy my friends crap,

07:14.601 --> 07:16.968
I should use my disgusting
wealth to buy my friends

07:16.970 --> 07:19.037
Things they would
actually enjoy.

07:20.407 --> 07:21.807
Come on, let's get out of here.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.241
Wait, w-where
are we going?

07:23.243 --> 07:24.810
To the chrysler dealership
across the street.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.278
I'm buying us all
matching pink jeeps.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.779
Wait, what?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.247
Yes. It's gonna be so fun.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.449
We can take
our matching pink jeeps

07:30.451 --> 07:31.983
On, like, an african safari
or something.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.618
How do we know that
they're gonna have

07:33.620 --> 07:34.953
Four identical pink jeeps?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.822
Yeah, and how are we gonna
get the jeeps to africa?

07:36.824 --> 07:38.790
I mean, are we gonna ship
them or we gonna take a ferry?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.792
I don't know, number five, okay?
Stop poking holes

07:40.794 --> 07:42.661
In the pink jeep idea, please,
and just accept the fact

07:42.663 --> 07:43.929
That I'm buying you all
pink jeeps.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.498
Take the win,
number five. Geez!

07:48.235 --> 07:49.734
What time is it?

07:49.736 --> 07:51.336
Oh, my god.
The mall is deserted.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.604
We've been shopping
for, like, ever

07:52.606 --> 07:53.972
With no liquids
or cotton balls.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.176
It's fine, we'll just
find an exit.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.654
Oh, no, we're locked in!

08:14.094 --> 08:15.660
Oh, as if, number five.

It's gonna be okay!

08:31.044 --> 08:33.044
It's gonna be okay!
And you're constantly

08:33.046 --> 08:36.615
And your stupid
little chicken legs...
Everything is her fault!

08:36.617 --> 08:39.551
I'm coming to help you!
I'm gonna help you, chanel!

08:39.553 --> 08:40.785
I'm gonna come
and help you.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.220
Oh, no-- look!

08:42.222 --> 08:44.723
(all scream)

08:44.725 --> 08:45.924
Wait, look.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.293
(gasping)

08:51.798 --> 08:53.064
Hurry!

08:53.066 --> 08:55.800
(whimpering)

08:56.737 --> 08:58.803
I am kappa president.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.652
All right, munsch.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.720
I guess it's finally
just me and you.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.924
(elevator whirring)

09:29.770 --> 09:31.136
(elevator bell dings)

09:40.781 --> 09:43.715
Oh, go on and shoot me, hag.
It'll just make me

09:43.717 --> 09:46.651
Young and skinny forever
and you'll still be old.

09:59.099 --> 10:03.034
(shrieking, crying)

10:05.939 --> 10:07.272
Come on, finish me off,

10:07.274 --> 10:09.708
You shriveled, old crone!

10:25.459 --> 10:26.891
Denise:
Hold on, baby girl!

10:26.893 --> 10:28.126
Freeze!

10:28.128 --> 10:29.160
First day

10:29.162 --> 10:31.229
On the job and I
caught a killer.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.831
(laughs)

10:32.833 --> 10:36.835
Ain't no way you're getting out
of this one, zayday williams.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.970
Wait,<i> you</i> have a gun?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.505
I sure do,

10:40.507 --> 10:42.841
'cause I am the new
chief of police

10:42.843 --> 10:44.743
In this town. Ow.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.812
They rest of the force got fired
'cause of gross incompetence

10:47.814 --> 10:51.683
And they hired denise hemphill,
'cause clearly

10:51.685 --> 10:53.018
I'm the only one

10:53.020 --> 10:55.020
With the sleuthin' skills

10:55.022 --> 10:56.021
To catch a s...

10:56.023 --> 10:57.822
Oh!

10:57.824 --> 10:59.824
Damn, he shot him!

10:59.826 --> 11:01.259
And he getting away!

11:03.697 --> 11:08.533
Denise: Hey... Oh! He... Oh, he
knocked over that big ol' tree!

11:08.535 --> 11:12.103
Damn! Why didn't I shoot him
when I had the chance?

11:12.105 --> 11:14.706
I was just talking
so much!

11:21.381 --> 11:23.148
Ladies of kappa, I'm calling
this house meeting to order.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.683
How's your crossbow wound?
It's doing very well, thank you.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.117
The arrow missed
all major arteries,

11:26.119 --> 11:28.987
And I'm currently rolling
on some sweet painkillers.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.288
(sighs):
Sisters...

11:30.290 --> 11:32.624
I think it's clear that
dean munsch is the killer.

11:32.626 --> 11:35.060
Well, I'm not sure
it's that clear at all.
It's clear.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.828
Dean munsch has been
after me and kappa house

11:36.830 --> 11:38.697
As an institution
since day one.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.666
<i>And</i> she was the only
person who knew we were
going to the mall.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.702
She knew it would be the
perfect place to kill us all.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.070
That means dean munsch
has been orchestrating

11:45.072 --> 11:46.871
Every one of these attacks.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.073
Melanie dorkus.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.407
Deaf taylor swift.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.542
That other
security guard.

11:50.544 --> 11:51.576
Predatory lez.

11:51.578 --> 11:52.811
Roger and dodger.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.512
Chad's irritating
armless friend.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.847
Candle-vlogger.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.182
Black british guy.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.983
Gigi.
Coney the ice cream cone.

11:58.985 --> 12:00.485
White trash mandy greenwell.

12:00.487 --> 12:01.586
Ms. Bean.

12:01.588 --> 12:03.588
Hold on.
<i>You</i> killed ms. Bean.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.356
I didn't turn on
the deep fryer, bitch!

12:05.358 --> 12:06.591
Like it or not,

12:06.593 --> 12:08.693
We're sisters, and dean
munsch is not gonna stop

12:08.695 --> 12:10.061
Until we're all dead and buried.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.529
We've tried going
to the police,

12:11.531 --> 12:13.198
And they've proven
they cannot protect us.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.066
So it's time we deal
with this problem ourselves.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.768
I sort of feel like we've
already been doing that.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.070
What exactly are you proposing?

12:19.072 --> 12:20.872
The only way
we're gonna stop the murders

12:20.874 --> 12:22.273
Is by killing dean munsch.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.544
No.

12:26.546 --> 12:27.846
No way.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.214
Come on, guys,

12:29.216 --> 12:30.381
This is insane.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.584
No, zayday, it isn't.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.220
Chanel...

12:35.222 --> 12:38.389
I can honestly say
that, for once,

12:38.391 --> 12:39.791
I actually agree with you.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.426
I also think that dean munsch

12:41.428 --> 12:43.261
Is the killer.
Thank you,

12:43.263 --> 12:45.730
Talking pumpkin.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.098
I have been talking
all year

12:47.100 --> 12:49.467
About how I want this house
to become a true sisterhood.

12:49.469 --> 12:50.802
I've always had
this vision

12:50.804 --> 12:52.737
Of a band of sisters
who stand together

12:52.739 --> 12:55.206
Like an impenetrable community
of shields who kept everyone

12:55.208 --> 12:57.242
Safe and secure.
But sometimes

12:57.244 --> 12:59.244
Playing defense
isn't enough.

12:59.246 --> 13:02.881
Sometimes, instead of shields,
we need swords.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.382
And sometimes to maintain

13:04.384 --> 13:07.152
A strong sisterhood...
A sister has to cross a line

13:07.154 --> 13:08.787
She never thought
she could cross.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.822
The time has come
for me to ask myself,

13:10.824 --> 13:12.657
For all of us
to ask ourselves,

13:12.659 --> 13:14.959
How much this house and
the girls in it mean to us.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.061
No one is going to help us.

13:17.063 --> 13:20.598
No one is going to stop this
until we are all dead.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.900
It's up to us.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.969
And I'm willing to do
whatever it takes to stop her.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.571
Dean munsch has to die.

13:26.573 --> 13:27.806
What?!

13:27.808 --> 13:30.341
Well, I'm sorry, but she is
a vindictive, amoral woman

13:30.343 --> 13:31.910
Who no one is gonna miss.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.512
Hester:
The question is, how?

13:34.514 --> 13:37.115
How do we murder dean munsch?

13:37.117 --> 13:39.184
Both:
I say we poison her.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.755
Well, then...

13:43.757 --> 13:46.191
I guess it's settled.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.967
This meeting
of the dickie dollar scholars

13:55.969 --> 13:57.602
Is now called to order.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.871
Uh, chad? I have no idea
what I'm doing here.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.773
Hold up. Earl grey has
to read the minutes

14:01.775 --> 14:04.175
From last week's meeting.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.977
(sighs heavily):
That's right.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.279
Earl grey was murdered.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.550
(sighs)

14:13.520 --> 14:16.654
All right, pete,
you got the floor.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.523
Uh, thanks. Uh... Wh...

14:18.525 --> 14:20.391
Why did you bring me here?

14:20.393 --> 14:22.994
Well, pete,
as you may or may not know,

14:22.996 --> 14:25.496
My best friend boone
was murdered.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.131
So we're here,
reading his will.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.000
Okay, but what does that
have to do with me?

14:29.002 --> 14:32.003
"I, boone clemens, in the event
of my untimely passing,

14:32.005 --> 14:34.072
"do solemnly bequeath
the following:

14:34.074 --> 14:35.974
"my awesome johnny cash poster,

14:35.976 --> 14:37.709
"where he's biting his lip
and giving everyone the finger

14:37.711 --> 14:40.678
"because you know he
just don't care about nothin'...

14:40.680 --> 14:42.814
To pete martinez."

14:42.816 --> 14:44.749
Wh-what?!
"my awesome xbox,

14:44.751 --> 14:46.517
"with the kinect thing
that I haven't figured out

14:46.519 --> 14:49.254
"how to hook it up but I hear is
so friggin' awesome when you do,

14:49.256 --> 14:50.588
To pete martinez."

14:50.590 --> 14:51.923
Doesn't make any sense.
I... (mutters)

14:51.925 --> 14:55.226
Please! Stop interrupting
my dead gay friend boone!

14:55.228 --> 14:56.928
(sighs)

14:56.930 --> 14:59.731
"my hbo go password
to pete martinez.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.367
"the shoebox under my bed that's
filled with bottles of lube

15:02.369 --> 15:04.535
"to pete martinez.
My buttplug,

15:04.537 --> 15:06.938
With the beautiful blue jewel
on the business end..."

15:08.742 --> 15:10.575
"...To pete martinez."

15:10.577 --> 15:12.577
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on. This is insane.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.379
I barely even knew the guy.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.047
Pete martinez...

15:16.049 --> 15:18.182
You got some 'splainin' to do.

15:18.184 --> 15:19.684
There's no explaining, okay?

15:19.686 --> 15:21.386
Clearly, the guy was crazy.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.687
Were you and boone
secret gay lovers?!

15:22.689 --> 15:24.255
Did you ever do it in my bed?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.057
Because if you did,
we about to get real.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.859
No, w-we were not lovers!

15:27.861 --> 15:29.260
You do not bequeath a shoebox

15:29.262 --> 15:30.361
Full of lube

15:30.363 --> 15:31.562
To an acquaintance,
pete martinez!

15:31.564 --> 15:32.764
He was my source!

15:32.766 --> 15:34.399
He was my source.

15:34.401 --> 15:37.268
Okay? He was my eyes and ears

15:37.270 --> 15:39.270
Inside greek system
at this school.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.606
When I decided to study
the history of kappa kappa tau,

15:41.608 --> 15:44.142
I went to him--
he was my deep throat.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.878
So you<i> were</i> gay lovers?

15:46.880 --> 15:48.613
No, we were not gay lovers.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.481
Okay, look,
I didn't tell anyone,

15:50.483 --> 15:52.550
'cause I didn't want
to blow his cover,

15:52.552 --> 15:53.818
Nor mine, for that matter.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.219
I'm an investigative journalist.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.722
Okay, secret friend of boone,

15:57.724 --> 16:00.558
And possible gay lover,
that explains a lot,

16:00.560 --> 16:01.626
But it does not
explain all.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.161
And it kind of reminds
me of the time,

16:03.163 --> 16:05.596
Last year, when you tried
to join the dollar scholars

16:05.598 --> 16:07.765
Despite having no experience
with caddying,

16:07.767 --> 16:11.069
And not even a rudimentary
knowledge of the game of golf.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.104
So...<i> Why</i> do you want to be

16:13.106 --> 16:16.007
A dickie dollar scholar?

16:16.009 --> 16:17.342
Well, you know,
I really love the idea

16:17.344 --> 16:18.676
Of a bunch of guys
from different backgrounds

16:18.678 --> 16:20.144
(slurping)
getting together and forming

16:20.146 --> 16:22.280
A brotherhood for life.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.315
But you've never
actually played golf.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.784
Um... No.

16:26.786 --> 16:27.852
Have you ever been
to a driving range?

16:27.854 --> 16:29.821
Yeah. You know, once, for lunch.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.990
What sort of ab regimen
are you rocking, bro?

16:31.992 --> 16:33.491
Sit-ups.
Okay...

16:33.493 --> 16:35.159
How many john mayer
albums do you own?

16:35.161 --> 16:37.762
I don't own
any john mayer albums.
Look, I'm gonna

16:37.764 --> 16:39.297
Be honest with you--
you're the worst

16:39.299 --> 16:41.432
Dickie dollar scholar
pledge candidate
I've ever seen.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.834
Worst.
You don't know
anything about golf,

16:42.836 --> 16:44.769
And you don't even own
john mayer's debut album,

16:44.771 --> 16:46.337
<i>Room for squares--</i>
which makes a lot of sense,

16:46.339 --> 16:48.373
'cause given the fact
that you don't even have

16:48.375 --> 16:51.142
A rad ab routine...
Your body, pete martinez,

16:51.144 --> 16:52.710
Is<i> not</i> a wonderland.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.313
I think it
really chapped your hide,

16:55.315 --> 16:57.281
Not becoming a dickie dollar
scholar that day.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.350
I think it chapped
your hide so much

16:59.352 --> 17:02.320
That you started stalking
my sort of hot,

17:02.322 --> 17:03.821
Sort of girlfriend chanel,

17:03.823 --> 17:06.190
For a full year.
Well, I'm gonna

17:06.192 --> 17:07.792
Let you in on a little secret.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.660
You stalking the chick
I was tappin'--

17:09.662 --> 17:12.497
Even though I was tappin'
a ton of other chicks, too--

17:12.499 --> 17:14.665
That really chapped my hide.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.034
Well, then...
I guess the fact

17:16.036 --> 17:17.969
That you and I cannot
stand one another

17:17.971 --> 17:19.337
Is finally
out in the open.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.240
Oh, it's way,<i> way</i> out
in the open,<i> jefe.</i>

17:23.843 --> 17:25.176
(scoffs)

17:25.178 --> 17:28.413
So I'm gonna
make a proposal.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.415
I'm inviting you to join

17:30.417 --> 17:33.818
The dickie dollar scholars.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.987
What?
I mean, any secret friend

17:35.989 --> 17:37.655
And possible gay
lover of boone...

17:37.657 --> 17:39.357
(scoffs)
is a friend of mine.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.726
Mmm... No.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.161
I'm sorry, what?

17:43.163 --> 17:44.429
First of all,
you're right--

17:44.431 --> 17:46.397
I don't know anything
there is to know about golf.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.267
Second... (scoffs)
fraternities suck.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.202
I know this now,
and I'm so happy

17:51.204 --> 17:53.037
I never joined one
in the first place.

17:53.039 --> 17:56.040
They're cruel, elitist,
and probably the reason why

17:56.042 --> 17:58.376
There's a serial killer on this
campus in the first place.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.211
So no, chad, I'm not gonna join

18:00.213 --> 18:02.213
Your stupid
dickie dollar scholars.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.514
Thanks, anyway.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.917
Name your weapon.

18:05.919 --> 18:06.951
What?
What'll it be?

18:06.953 --> 18:09.053
Sabres?

18:09.055 --> 18:10.688
Dueling pistols?

18:10.690 --> 18:12.790
Dude, what are you
even talking about?

18:12.792 --> 18:16.360
Well, it's a longstanding
dickie dollar tradition that,

18:16.362 --> 18:18.863
If you're offered membership
in the dickie dollar scholars,

18:18.865 --> 18:22.233
And you refuse membership into
the dickie dollar scholars...

18:22.235 --> 18:24.302
You must duel.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.270
So pick your weapon.

18:26.272 --> 18:30.074
You can choose sabres,
guns, baseball bats,

18:30.076 --> 18:32.610
Small pebbles, spoons...

18:32.612 --> 18:34.378
Doesn't matter
to me.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.047
What does matter...

18:36.049 --> 18:38.082
Is that we will fight...

18:38.084 --> 18:40.551
And we will fight to the death.
Thanks, dude,

18:40.553 --> 18:42.653
But... Not interested.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.388
Walking away from
a duel means

18:44.390 --> 18:46.224
You are forfeiting your
life, would-be brother.

18:46.226 --> 18:49.160
You<i> will</i> get murdered,
pete martinez!

18:49.162 --> 18:50.228
Murdered to death.

18:56.769 --> 18:59.403
Well, I am sorry that
took so long, but, you know,

18:59.405 --> 19:01.439
A watched pot never boils.

19:01.441 --> 19:02.773
Grace:
Uh... Sanka?

19:02.775 --> 19:05.143
Yes. Did you know
that the word "sanka"

19:05.145 --> 19:07.778
Is derived from the french
<i>"sans caféine"?</i>

19:07.780 --> 19:10.114
Dean munsch, first let me
say how honored we are

19:10.116 --> 19:12.517
That you've invited us into
your hideously furnished home.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.287
What do you want, chanel?

19:16.289 --> 19:19.290
Well, now that there's
no one else around
to compare you to,

19:19.292 --> 19:21.959
We've realized that you are
kind of an amazing woman.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.628
Like all of
the unsolicited advice

19:23.630 --> 19:25.796
You give us is actually
really valuable.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.798
We understand that
as millennial feminists...

19:27.800 --> 19:29.267
W-wait a minute.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.202
That's a thing?

19:31.204 --> 19:32.470
Oh, yeah.
Totally.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.472
Yeah.
Being a millennial
feminist

19:34.474 --> 19:36.040
Means growing up listening
to taylor swift say

19:36.042 --> 19:39.143
She doesn't like to think of
the world as boys versus girls.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.645
Yes, and then
graduating

19:40.647 --> 19:42.213
And entering the workforce,
only to realize

19:42.215 --> 19:44.982
That you make 20% less than men
for doing the same job.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.784
That's not what feminism
was about.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.452
You see?
We don't know.

19:48.454 --> 19:50.154
And we want to learn.

19:50.156 --> 19:51.822
All this...

19:51.824 --> 19:53.824
Killing has really, um,
shown us the importance

19:53.826 --> 19:56.494
Of sisterhood-- you know,
um, how crucial it is

19:56.496 --> 19:58.763
For women to join together.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.199
Wh-which is
why we're pleased

20:01.201 --> 20:03.301
To announce that this
is the first meeting

20:03.303 --> 20:05.203
Of the wallace u. Campus
feminist collective.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.571
Yay!
(chuckles)

20:15.315 --> 20:16.814
W-wait a minute.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.983
Is... Is this apple cider?

20:20.153 --> 20:22.186
How did you know
that was my favorite?

20:22.188 --> 20:24.021
Chanel #3:
How come all the pictures
on the wall are selfies?

20:24.023 --> 20:26.424
Does she not have any friends?
Chanel:
Shut up, ho-bag. We're looking

20:26.426 --> 20:28.426
For clues about how to trick her
into drinking poison.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.528
Wait. Look at her status.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.831
"just waiting for my next
delicious cup of apple cider.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.933
It's my favorite."

20:38.037 --> 20:39.837
(sniffing)

20:39.839 --> 20:42.673
Oh, it smells amazing.

20:42.675 --> 20:43.708
You know, as
an educator,

20:43.710 --> 20:45.710
You just never know...

20:45.712 --> 20:47.578
If you're reaching
your students.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.947
Girls, I'm...
I'm really touched.

20:50.883 --> 20:51.849
To feminism.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.552
(jars clack)

20:54.554 --> 20:57.255
And what feminism...
Means to me.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.590
(sloshing)

21:05.031 --> 21:07.965
Chanel:<i> Where did you get</i>
<i>puffer fish venom?</i>

21:07.967 --> 21:09.066
From my puffer fish.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.701
Wait. How do we know
how much to put in?

21:10.703 --> 21:12.703
I heard a drop is enough
to kill a man instantly.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.572
Better put in the whole thing,
just to be sure.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.173
I want to be there
when she dies.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.454
(laughs):
Oh, wow!

21:30.456 --> 21:32.223
That's bliss!

21:32.225 --> 21:34.325
So, where
do we begin?

21:34.327 --> 21:36.160
I interned at<i> ms.</i> Magazine.

21:36.162 --> 21:37.795
(echoing):
And, oh, remind me,

21:37.797 --> 21:40.231
I want to show you both
the original

21:40.233 --> 21:42.433
<i>Ms.</i> Magazine cover...
(distorting unintelligibly)

21:42.435 --> 21:45.236
(munsch continues,
echoing unintelligibly)

21:45.238 --> 21:47.438
(echoing):
It was the beginning...

21:47.440 --> 21:49.006
(munsch continues,
unintelligibly)

21:49.008 --> 21:50.141
That woman...

21:50.143 --> 21:51.742
(speaking clearly):
Was susan sontag.

21:51.744 --> 21:52.743
And that band

21:52.745 --> 21:55.112
Was bachman-turner
overdrive.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.947
Wow! Girls...

21:56.949 --> 21:58.616
This cider...

21:58.618 --> 22:00.418
Is it... Is it homemade?

22:00.420 --> 22:02.119
Yep. Yeah.
Because, you know,

22:02.121 --> 22:04.955
I'm getting some notes--
um... It's a spice.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.290
Is it nutmeg?

22:06.292 --> 22:07.358
(gasps)

22:11.331 --> 22:13.497
(burps)

22:13.499 --> 22:15.499
(laughing):
Well, yes.

22:15.501 --> 22:18.703
Absolutely nutmeg.<i> Excusez-moi.</i>

22:18.705 --> 22:21.505
Girls, since you have
no other classes,

22:21.507 --> 22:24.275
I am going to ask
that you write 10,000 words

22:24.277 --> 22:26.644
On the militant suffragette
movement

22:26.646 --> 22:31.015
As expressed in the wspu
hunger strikes of 1912.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.184
Thanks, girls. Bottoms up.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.453
(munsch gulping)

22:35.455 --> 22:38.656
There was enough poison in there
to kill three dean munsches.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.157
It makes no sense.

22:40.159 --> 22:42.893
And now I have to write
a stupid term paper.

22:42.895 --> 22:45.629
Maybe this was a blessing.
You're not a killer, grace.

22:45.631 --> 22:48.399
Of course I'm not.
I am like a soldier at war.

22:48.401 --> 22:50.401
I am killing
to stop more killing.

22:50.403 --> 22:51.869
It's totally justified.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.304
But you're not a soldier,

22:53.306 --> 22:54.839
And these aren't the beaches
of normandy.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.574
This is wallace university
in 2015,

22:56.576 --> 22:59.643
And killing dean munsch
is against the law.
Okay.

22:59.645 --> 23:01.212
But what about moral law?

23:01.214 --> 23:03.981
What if I didn't do anything
when I know I could

23:03.983 --> 23:05.850
And then...

23:05.852 --> 23:08.219
And then dean munsch killed you?

23:08.221 --> 23:10.688
Oh, that would be hard for you?

23:10.690 --> 23:13.090
Uh, yeah,
that would be hard for me.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.425
Obviously.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.161
(chuckles)

23:18.998 --> 23:21.332
Oh, uh...
(chuckles)

23:21.334 --> 23:23.000
I have to tell you something.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.102
Okay.
So,

23:25.104 --> 23:28.706
Chad radwell invited me to join
the dickie dollar scholars.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.374
Why? You don't play golf.

23:30.376 --> 23:31.942
I don't do anything
they do there.

23:31.944 --> 23:34.945
I don't "rage" on Tuesday nights
or have competitions

23:34.947 --> 23:37.882
About how many girls
I can have sex with in one day.
Ugh.

23:37.884 --> 23:39.917
Sometimes I kind of side
with the red devil.

23:39.919 --> 23:44.221
I mean, he's cleaning
all the mess and filth

23:44.223 --> 23:48.125
Of this place in a way
no dean or exposé ever could.

23:49.395 --> 23:50.961
I, I... I-I'm sorry. That...

23:50.963 --> 23:52.396
Came out wrong. Uh...

23:52.398 --> 23:54.398
(stammers)
what I'm trying

23:54.400 --> 23:56.767
To say is guys join fraternities

23:56.769 --> 23:58.769
To get a sense of structure
in their lives.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.105
Problem is the structure
they're buying into

24:01.107 --> 24:03.974
Is-is antiquated. It's...

24:03.976 --> 24:07.812
Misogynistic and hierarchical
and dangerous.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.613
I have structure.

24:09.615 --> 24:12.950
I have my work at the paper,

24:12.952 --> 24:16.120
My dreams of working
at slate.Com,

24:16.122 --> 24:18.389
And I have you.

24:18.391 --> 24:20.791
And that's all you need?

24:20.793 --> 24:22.560
That's all I need.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.562
Hmm.
Hmm.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.630
(gentle chuckle)

24:29.802 --> 24:31.268
(pants)

24:31.270 --> 24:33.003
(quietly):
Let's do this.
(sighs)

24:33.005 --> 24:35.072
Grace...

24:35.074 --> 24:36.774
I love you.

24:36.776 --> 24:39.109
I... I don't know.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.277
I mean, I want to.

24:40.279 --> 24:42.079
You know that. I really do.
I just, um...

24:42.081 --> 24:44.815
I don't think I'm in the
right headspace right now.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.151
Okay.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.553
You're worth the wait.

24:57.964 --> 25:01.599
You know, maybe after
we kill dean munsch.

25:02.635 --> 25:05.302
No... No, grace...
What?

25:05.304 --> 25:07.304
You can't do this.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.807
Justified or not,
you're not a killer.

25:09.809 --> 25:12.810
You're a rare breed,
one of the true good guys.

25:12.812 --> 25:15.379
Even if dean munsch
is the red devil

25:15.381 --> 25:16.947
And you kill her,
then she may lose,

25:16.949 --> 25:18.949
But this house wins.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.818
The worst parts of this house,

25:20.820 --> 25:24.522
The parts you have been fighting
so hard to get rid of.

25:24.524 --> 25:27.024
And if you kill her,
you will become

25:27.026 --> 25:28.692
Those parts.

25:28.694 --> 25:31.362
And that...

25:31.364 --> 25:33.931
Would break my heart.

25:37.470 --> 25:39.537
(sighs)

25:54.887 --> 25:56.253
Chanel:<i> All right, ladies,</i>
<i>I want updates.</i>

25:56.255 --> 25:57.888
We poisoned dean munsch
several hours ago.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.723
She should have checked
into an emergency room by now.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.492
The woman at zionist memorial
hospital said they only admitted

26:01.494 --> 26:03.260
One person to the er all night,
but it was some dude

26:03.262 --> 26:05.095
Who needed help getting a lego
figure out of his rectum.

26:05.097 --> 26:06.263
What an idiot.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.499
It was chad radwell.

26:08.501 --> 26:10.267
What?
The nurse said he told her

26:10.269 --> 26:11.235
He usually does
his nightly nude yoga

26:11.237 --> 26:12.836
Before he sets a perimeter

26:12.838 --> 26:14.705
Of lego characters to guard
his bed while he sleeps,

26:14.707 --> 26:16.707
But this time he decided
to do it after,

26:16.709 --> 26:19.543
And accidentally sat
on lego captain jack sparrow.

26:19.545 --> 26:21.912
That's the weirdest explanation
for anything I've ever heard.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.948
Damn it! So, clearly,
it's impossible

26:23.950 --> 26:25.549
To poison dean munsch
because she has some weird

26:25.551 --> 26:28.085
Buzzard gullet that can
safely digest anything!

26:28.087 --> 26:30.187
We need to think of new ways
to kill her!

26:30.189 --> 26:32.623
No. I'm not doing this.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.358
What? Two hours ago,

26:34.360 --> 26:35.626
You were like,
"let's poison the bitch!"
well,

26:35.628 --> 26:37.294
I had a change of heart.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.096
Look, I still think she's
most likely the killer,

26:39.098 --> 26:41.398
But all the evidence
against her is circumstantial.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.900
We still don't
have a smoking gun,

26:42.902 --> 26:44.368
And if we decide to kill
her without an overabundance

26:44.370 --> 26:46.403
Of proof, we are no better
than the red devil.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.405
Who, yes, is
probably dean munsch.

26:48.407 --> 26:50.608
All those in favor of kicking
grace out of kappa house?

26:51.243 --> 26:53.143
What? No.

26:53.145 --> 26:54.311
You can't do that.

26:54.313 --> 26:55.613
That's not in the house rules.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.247
All those in favor

26:57.249 --> 26:58.882
Of temporarily changing
the house rules

26:58.884 --> 27:00.818
So that I<i> can</i> kick grace out
of kappa house?

27:02.588 --> 27:04.989
Sorry, jack skellington.
You're out.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.590
Fine.

27:06.592 --> 27:09.059
It was really great getting
to know all of you.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.561
I'm really gonna cherish
our time here together.

27:10.563 --> 27:12.329
Come on, zayday, let's go.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.164
Grace, I'm not coming with you.

27:14.166 --> 27:16.934
I love you to death and
we'll be friends forever, but...

27:16.936 --> 27:18.736
I think chanel
is right.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.071
Killing is wrong,
but, under this circumstance,

27:21.073 --> 27:22.640
I don't know what
other choice we have.

27:22.642 --> 27:24.441
It's pretty obvious
she's the killer,

27:24.443 --> 27:26.944
And she's not gonna stop
until every one of us is dead.

27:26.946 --> 27:29.513
Grace, I'm sorry.

27:29.515 --> 27:33.651
But I think you were right
the first time.

27:33.653 --> 27:34.918
I hate to say it,

27:34.920 --> 27:36.854
But killing dean munsch
is the right thing to do.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.923
(scoffs)

27:42.628 --> 27:44.695
Chanel:
Hold on, sluts.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.366
I've got it.

27:49.368 --> 27:50.934
Hey.
Hey.

27:50.936 --> 27:52.269
Gracie,

27:52.271 --> 27:53.270
Come on in.
I just wanted

27:53.272 --> 27:54.805
To see how you were doing.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.640
I would guess it's
probably pretty traumatizing

27:56.642 --> 27:58.976
To be served your girlfriend's
head for thanksgiving dinner.

27:58.978 --> 28:00.110
So, uh,

28:00.112 --> 28:01.111
What are you doing?

28:01.113 --> 28:02.379
Well, just doing some research.

28:02.381 --> 28:03.981
You're not gonna believe
what we found.

28:03.983 --> 28:04.815
(door opens)
"we"?

28:04.817 --> 28:05.816
Hey, grace.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.051
Uh, wait, I'm sorry,

28:07.053 --> 28:08.519
Are you guys,
like, friends now

28:08.521 --> 28:09.820
Or something?
I just needed

28:09.822 --> 28:11.388
Your dad to go
through all the info

28:11.390 --> 28:13.223
In my gigi file, see
if he could illuminate anything.

28:13.225 --> 28:14.158
And...?

28:14.160 --> 28:15.492
Well...

28:15.494 --> 28:17.161
Nothing. I mean,

28:17.163 --> 28:20.831
Gigi never really shared
anything about herself with me.

28:20.833 --> 28:24.301
In fact,
now that I think about it,

28:24.303 --> 28:26.804
I knew basically nothing
about her.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.472
I actually thought

28:28.474 --> 28:32.176
Her last name was caldwellt,
with a "t" at the end.

28:32.178 --> 28:35.345
Which it wasn't.
But it wasn't caldwell either.

28:35.347 --> 28:37.848
You know how we decided that
she was the hag of shady lane?

28:37.850 --> 28:39.583
Well, I figured
that that must mean

28:39.585 --> 28:41.185
That she was the fourth girl
in the bathroom that night,

28:41.187 --> 28:42.319
The one who took the babies.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.822
Which means she would have to be

28:44.824 --> 28:46.423
One of the last two names

28:46.425 --> 28:47.858
On the list
from dean munsch's office.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.360
And I finally got
the mental institution

28:50.362 --> 28:52.362
To release
her intake paperwork, and...

28:52.364 --> 28:55.365
Guess what name she was
admitted under-- jess meyer.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.201
So she was the fourth
girl in the bathroom.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.203
That's not what the file says.
You see,

28:59.205 --> 29:01.538
The psychiatrist report says
that she was diagnosed

29:01.540 --> 29:04.374
With having a mental breakdown
after her sister amy

29:04.376 --> 29:05.876
Committed suicide

29:05.878 --> 29:07.845
Just a few months earlier.
Gigi's sister

29:07.847 --> 29:09.847
Was the one who took the babies
that night.

29:09.849 --> 29:12.282
And she tried to raise them
for herself for a short while,

29:12.284 --> 29:15.953
But... The stress and guilt
was too much for her to handle.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.455
So gigi raised those
babies to be killers

29:18.457 --> 29:20.791
To get revenge on kappa
and the people responsible

29:20.793 --> 29:22.226
For the death
of her sister.

29:22.228 --> 29:23.594
Wow, dad,

29:23.596 --> 29:26.363
First mom, then gigi--
you sure can pick 'em.

29:27.967 --> 29:30.134
Okay. Well, um,

29:30.136 --> 29:31.935
I'm going to go,

29:31.937 --> 29:34.371
Because I have enough info
to start writing my story.

29:34.373 --> 29:37.407
I just need to know who the
killer is so I have an ending.

29:37.409 --> 29:40.110
I'm gonna take off.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.780
Okay.

29:42.782 --> 29:44.448
Bye.

29:44.450 --> 29:45.649
Bye.

29:45.651 --> 29:46.750
See you, bud.
Yeah.

29:46.752 --> 29:48.485
(door shuts)

29:48.487 --> 29:51.421
So, how are you really doing?

29:51.423 --> 29:53.423
Look, I know she was a liar

29:53.425 --> 29:55.559
And spent almost 20 years
raising and training

29:55.561 --> 29:57.895
These innocent children
to become mass murderers,

29:57.897 --> 30:00.230
But I also really liked her.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.232
She thought I was cool.

30:02.234 --> 30:04.768
You know?
She liked my playlists.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.770
And I believe

30:06.772 --> 30:09.773
That even though everything else
was a lie

30:09.775 --> 30:12.276
That she really liked
my playlists.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.912
Aw, she did, dad.
I'm sure she did.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.346
Um, anyway...

30:16.348 --> 30:18.415
(clears throat)
how are you?

30:18.417 --> 30:20.651
Hmm?
(chuckles)
I'm fine.

30:20.653 --> 30:23.787
Pete? Actually,
I think pete

30:23.789 --> 30:25.355
Is a really nice guy.

30:25.357 --> 30:27.958
Okay, I know I'm going to sound
like such a dork,

30:27.960 --> 30:29.159
But, nowadays,

30:29.161 --> 30:30.828
There's a certain expectation

30:30.830 --> 30:33.297
When you have a boyfriend.
Mm-hmm.

30:33.299 --> 30:34.598
You know, with...
Yep. I know.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.800
There's...
No, no, no. Please don't...

30:36.802 --> 30:38.468
I understand what you're saying.
Just don't say anything else.
You... Oh...

30:38.470 --> 30:41.505
Wow. These are those moments
I wish your mom was still alive.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.040
I mean, not your actual mom.
She would have...

30:43.042 --> 30:44.842
She would have told you
to fake being pregnant

30:44.844 --> 30:47.311
And then had him give you money
for fake morning-after pills

30:47.313 --> 30:50.547
And then sleep with his friends
to make him jealous.

30:50.549 --> 30:53.217
A real mom
to help you with this.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.219
Maybe I can...

30:55.221 --> 30:57.287
Make you a playlist about it?

30:57.289 --> 30:59.156
No, dad, come on.

30:59.158 --> 31:01.558
I need you right now.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.193
Here's what I think.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.995
When I was your age,

31:04.997 --> 31:07.164
I was thoughtless about sex.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.299
So thoughtless
that I fathered twins

31:09.301 --> 31:11.335
With a girl whose name
I can't remember,

31:11.337 --> 31:13.170
And those twins grew up

31:13.172 --> 31:15.172
To murder a bunch of people.

31:15.174 --> 31:18.075
Now, I know that that might seem

31:18.077 --> 31:20.744
Like an extreme consequence
of teen sex,

31:20.746 --> 31:22.646
But the lesson remains
the same.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.815
Honey...

31:24.817 --> 31:27.351
If you don't think you're ready,
you probably aren't.

31:27.353 --> 31:29.052
And if you aren't,

31:29.054 --> 31:32.289
Well, then no good can come
from doing it, anyway.

31:36.562 --> 31:38.662
The main thing is you have
to be perfectly dry.

31:38.664 --> 31:41.064
The cryosauna is set
to 200 degrees below zero,

31:41.066 --> 31:43.066
So any water on your skin
will freeze instantly.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.736
Well, I'm just so
excited about this.

31:45.738 --> 31:47.571
I follow jennifer
grey on instagram,

31:47.573 --> 31:49.506
And she raves
about cryo.

31:49.508 --> 31:50.607
Oh, I swear by it.

31:50.609 --> 31:52.175
20 to 30 minutes
in the cryosauna

31:52.177 --> 31:54.077
And I feel better.
My skin's glowing.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.913
It's amazing for arthritis
and lupus.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.681
So, who wants
to go first?

31:57.683 --> 32:00.784
Dean munsch? I always say,
age before beauty.
(chuckles)

32:00.786 --> 32:02.953
Well, thank
you very much.

32:02.955 --> 32:04.955
Um, okay.

32:04.957 --> 32:07.190
Wish me luck, girls.

32:10.296 --> 32:13.597
Oh, wow, isn't it beautiful?

32:13.599 --> 32:15.699
Oh, and it's not as cold
as I thought it would be.

32:15.701 --> 32:16.733
Mm-mm.

32:16.735 --> 32:18.902
Well...

32:18.904 --> 32:21.204
Okay.

32:26.979 --> 32:28.779
(sighs)

32:28.781 --> 32:31.949
See you on the other side.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.353
(keypad blips)

32:43.963 --> 32:45.629
Number three, guard the door.
Don't let anybody in.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.464
Dean munsch will be dead
in ten minutes.

32:54.773 --> 32:56.673
(ticking)

32:56.675 --> 32:59.009
How come there hasn't been
any screaming?

32:59.011 --> 33:02.746
Yeah. She hasn't even tried to
break down the door or anything.

33:02.748 --> 33:05.849
'cause dean munsch has
frozen to death, idiots.

33:05.851 --> 33:07.417
If she tried to
break the door down,

33:07.419 --> 33:08.986
Her arms would snap off.

33:08.988 --> 33:10.821
Geez. There's a little movie
called<i> terminator</i>

33:10.823 --> 33:12.322
You girls might want
to consider watching.

33:12.324 --> 33:15.158
Number six, you
got the body bag?
Check.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.626
Okay, the car's
idling out back.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.328
We pull bitch popsicle
from the freezer,

33:18.330 --> 33:19.830
Throw her in the trunk
and make tracks.

33:21.834 --> 33:24.735
(door whooshing open)

33:29.041 --> 33:33.076
Oh, my god,
she looks terrible.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.514
(gasping)

33:37.516 --> 33:39.216
I've never felt better.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.919
All right, girls, who's next?

33:51.997 --> 33:54.264
(groans, sighs)
(phone ringing)

33:59.071 --> 34:01.038
What do you want?

34:01.040 --> 34:03.073
I can't.

34:03.075 --> 34:05.475
'cause I'm leaving campus,
just like you should.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.811
No, we need to get away
while we still can.

34:07.813 --> 34:10.380
Hey, hey, it's enough.
The point has been made.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.883
Why do you want to continue
taking this any further?

34:12.885 --> 34:15.085
Yes, I feel guilty!

34:15.087 --> 34:17.054
'cause it's not who I am!

34:17.056 --> 34:19.089
Listen to me.

34:19.091 --> 34:22.592
Don't you ever call me again.

34:33.906 --> 34:37.541
(doors creaking open)

34:37.543 --> 34:40.110
(sighs)

34:41.780 --> 34:43.780
Chanel:
<i>Okay, you incompetent</i>

34:43.782 --> 34:47.050
Heifers, I need to know
it's physically possible

34:47.052 --> 34:50.587
For dean munsch to have survived
27 minutes in a cryochamber

34:50.589 --> 34:53.023
Set to negative 200
degrees below zero.

34:53.025 --> 34:54.891
Zayday, go.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.126
I heard about
these buddhist monks

34:56.128 --> 34:57.394
That found a way
to meditate,

34:57.396 --> 34:59.062
So they can sit
outside all night,

34:59.064 --> 35:00.931
Way, way up
in the himalayas in weather

35:00.933 --> 35:02.799
That would kill a normal person,

35:02.801 --> 35:04.868
But their core temperature
stays totally normal.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.937
So, you think
dean munsch studied meditation

35:06.939 --> 35:09.739
With buddhist monks
in the himalayas?

35:09.741 --> 35:11.408
That's what I said,
wasn't it?

35:11.410 --> 35:13.910
Number five, go.

35:13.912 --> 35:16.046
So, I saw
this documentary once about

35:16.048 --> 35:17.581
This high schooler
who could grow

35:17.583 --> 35:19.583
All this really thick hair
all over his body,

35:19.585 --> 35:21.418
If he concentrated
really, really hard on it.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.320
And maybe dean munsch
can do that, too.

35:23.322 --> 35:24.955
I mean, this kid was,
like, amazing.

35:24.957 --> 35:26.823
Like, he won this high school
basketball championship

35:26.825 --> 35:28.725
Singlehanded...

35:28.727 --> 35:30.827
You're thinking of the movie
<i>teen wolf,</i> you brainless gash,

35:30.829 --> 35:32.496
Which is not, in fact,
a documentary!

35:32.498 --> 35:34.931
Hester:
Maybe dean munsch
is like rasputin.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.633
Like what?!

35:36.635 --> 35:38.101
Uh, rasputin.

35:38.103 --> 35:39.569
He was a mystical
russian peasant

35:39.571 --> 35:41.104
Who became a close advisor

35:41.106 --> 35:42.939
Of tsar nicholas ii
because he could magically

35:42.941 --> 35:45.342
Cure prince alexei
of his hemophilia.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.110
Okay, this seems
totally not germane to what

35:47.112 --> 35:49.279
We're talking about, so can we
please just skip ahead...?

35:49.281 --> 35:51.248
No! Listen!

35:51.250 --> 35:54.117
Rasputin gained more and
more power with the tsarina,

35:54.119 --> 35:56.786
So, a group of conspirators
invited rasputin to dinner

35:56.788 --> 35:59.289
So that they could give him
a cup of poisoned wine.

35:59.291 --> 36:03.093
But when rasputin drank the
entire bottle of poisoned wine,

36:03.095 --> 36:06.429
It had no effect on him, except
just making him burp a lot.

36:06.431 --> 36:09.299
So one of the plotters
freaked out and took a pistol

36:09.301 --> 36:11.034
Right in rasputin's
chest and shot him.

36:11.036 --> 36:12.035
But it did nothing,

36:12.037 --> 36:13.470
Except just made him scream,

36:13.472 --> 36:14.871
Along with the burping.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.439
So they shot him
again-- nothing!

36:16.441 --> 36:18.775
And then, they shot him in
the head. Still nothing!

36:18.777 --> 36:19.943
Rasputin

36:19.945 --> 36:21.645
Wouldn't die.

36:21.647 --> 36:24.014
They decided to just take a club
and start beating him

36:24.016 --> 36:25.549
Until finally,

36:25.551 --> 36:27.050
Rasputin stopped moving.

36:27.052 --> 36:28.885
They cut off his genitalia,
wrapped him in a rug

36:28.887 --> 36:31.221
And threw him into
an icy river.

36:31.223 --> 36:34.024
Two days later, when
they found the body

36:34.026 --> 36:38.528
Floating downstream,
rasputin's nails were gone!

36:38.530 --> 36:40.363
He tried clawing himself
(high-pitched scratching)

36:40.365 --> 36:41.364
Out of the ice.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.867
In the end, he drowned.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.202
Maybe she has some

36:45.204 --> 36:46.870
Magical powers that
make her unable

36:46.872 --> 36:48.471
To die, like some
horror movie villain,

36:48.473 --> 36:50.307
Like michael myers, or
jason, or dr. Giggles.

36:50.309 --> 36:52.309
Hold on.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.077
I just thought of something.

36:54.079 --> 36:56.880
I was gonna wait
to give you guys these

36:56.882 --> 36:59.583
To celebrate another
successful black Friday.

37:01.386 --> 37:04.087
But now I have another idea.

37:04.089 --> 37:07.257
They're brand-new
smartphones.

37:07.259 --> 37:09.192
And keep them on
you at all times.

37:09.194 --> 37:10.860
I like the phone
I already have.

37:10.862 --> 37:12.229
These phones are better!
Trust me!

37:12.231 --> 37:13.997
I already activated
each phone,

37:13.999 --> 37:16.233
So when I call you, the edge
will silently flash a color.

37:16.235 --> 37:17.500
In this case, red.

37:17.502 --> 37:19.736
Now, when you see the edge
go red,

37:19.738 --> 37:21.338
Don't even pick up.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.340
Just quietly head down
to the university pool.

37:23.342 --> 37:25.875
I'll lure dean munsch there
by asking her to meet me alone,

37:25.877 --> 37:27.911
And then, right before
she can murder me,

37:27.913 --> 37:30.914
We'll drown the bitch,
just like rasputin.

37:30.916 --> 37:33.984
Got it? Good.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.520
Hi. Excuse me?

37:37.522 --> 37:40.257
So, I'm gonna need all
of these to be a size zero.

37:40.259 --> 37:42.225
Oh. Well, they all should come
in a size zero.

37:42.227 --> 37:45.428
Okay, but I'm gonna need<i> these</i>
to be a size zero,

37:45.430 --> 37:46.463
And right now,
they're a size four.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.765
So, maybe try on a size zero.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.033
Okay, I'm not gonna try on
the size zero

37:50.035 --> 37:51.268
Because I won't fit
into the size zero.

37:51.270 --> 37:52.402
I fit into the size four,
but I'm not gonna

37:52.404 --> 37:53.770
Leave the store
with a bunch of size fours.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.472
I'm gonna leave the store
with a bunch of size zeroes.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.374
I really don't know
what you're asking me to do.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.909
I'm sorry, but do you realize
how rude you're being?

37:59.911 --> 38:01.945
You have no right
to treat our friend like that.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.114
I-I just don't know
what you're asking. I...

38:04.116 --> 38:05.982
Okay, what I am
asking you to do

38:05.984 --> 38:08.151
Is to take all the tags
off of the size zeroes

38:08.153 --> 38:10.320
And put them onto the size fours
so that I can leave

38:10.322 --> 38:12.389
This establishment with what
I came for, which is a bunch

38:12.391 --> 38:14.124
Of size zero garments
of a sexy lingerie nature!

38:14.126 --> 38:15.825
I don't think I can do that.

38:15.827 --> 38:16.960
Hester:
You can't?

38:16.962 --> 38:18.428
Can't do what?
Your job?

38:18.430 --> 38:19.596
(phone buzzing)
one second away from
calling the police.

38:19.598 --> 38:20.964
This is discrimination!

38:20.966 --> 38:22.299
'cause at this point, this
is a civil rights issue.

38:22.301 --> 38:23.633
You're not letting us shop?
How dare you?!

38:23.635 --> 38:25.335
What rights issue?
Make her happy!
She has nothing.

38:25.337 --> 38:27.003
She's a terrible person.
She's trying to
block a friend of ours?

38:27.005 --> 38:29.005
Look at her. Give her something.
Give her something to be happy!

38:35.480 --> 38:37.580
Come on, what is wrong
with these idiots?!

38:39.651 --> 38:41.351
(gasps) oh. Hi.

38:41.353 --> 38:42.686
Hello, chanel.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.654
Why did you ask me
to meet you here?

38:44.656 --> 38:48.191
And why are you carrying a bag
clearly filled with chains?

38:48.193 --> 38:52.028
Um... Bondage.

38:54.199 --> 38:56.366
Bondage?

38:56.368 --> 38:58.335
Yeah, I-I thought
for this week's

38:58.337 --> 39:00.870
Campus feminist collective,
we could talk

39:00.872 --> 39:04.007
About the rise of s&m
in contemporary literature.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.776
I thought you might have
a few words to say on it.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.478
About bondage?

39:08.480 --> 39:09.546
Mm-hmm.

39:11.783 --> 39:14.851
Well...

39:14.853 --> 39:18.121
Where is everybody?

39:18.123 --> 39:21.858
Actually, I don't know.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.793
Do you think maybe it's because

39:23.795 --> 39:25.662
There's a serial killer
on the loose,

39:25.664 --> 39:27.664
And the entire campus

39:27.666 --> 39:30.633
Has been evacuated?

39:30.635 --> 39:33.036
See, now I'm feeling
really stupid

39:33.038 --> 39:36.639
Because I'm just
remembering that.

39:38.243 --> 39:42.112
Well, it's, uh...
It's a shame.

39:45.317 --> 39:48.284
Because I have quite a lot
to say on the matter.

39:49.821 --> 39:53.656
One more thing.

39:53.658 --> 39:57.260
Why did you want
the campus feminists

39:57.262 --> 40:00.330
To meet at a pool?

40:00.332 --> 40:03.266
I thought we could talk about
bondage and... Go for a swim.

40:03.268 --> 40:04.768
Hmm.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.505
Yeah.

40:14.246 --> 40:15.745
(footsteps departing)

40:29.461 --> 40:32.195
Chanel:<i> The sheer level</i>
<i>of idiocy and ineptitude</i>

40:32.197 --> 40:34.097
<i>Inside this sorority</i>
<i>has reached a level</i>

40:34.099 --> 40:35.732
<i>That can no longer</i>
<i>be tolerated.</i>

40:35.734 --> 40:37.400
<i>I am going</i>
<i>to write the missive...</i>

40:37.402 --> 40:38.401
(knuckles cracking)

40:38.403 --> 40:39.869
<i>...To end all missives.</i>
(sighs)

40:39.871 --> 40:42.539
<i>These morons need someone</i>
<i>to tear them a new one.</i>

40:42.541 --> 40:45.875
"dear kappa sisters..."

40:45.877 --> 40:48.445
<i>And that someone is named "me."</i>

40:58.623 --> 41:00.657
Oh. Hey.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.358
Hey.

41:03.795 --> 41:06.062
You're all packed up.

41:06.064 --> 41:08.998
I thought you were staying
until you cracked the case.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.567
Oh, yeah. No, no, no,
uh... Totally.

41:10.569 --> 41:12.502
I was just gonna go
to the woods and...

41:12.504 --> 41:14.771
And write or something,
like-like-like thoreau, but

41:14.773 --> 41:15.772
With wifi.

41:15.774 --> 41:17.574
Oh. Um, were you gonna

41:17.576 --> 41:19.275
Come say good-bye
and tell me that?

41:19.277 --> 41:22.579
I mean, maybe I
could come with you.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.347
Might be kind of
romantic, you know?

41:24.349 --> 41:26.950
Being all alone,
out in the woods.

41:26.952 --> 41:30.620
A sexy little cabin,
a fireplace...

41:30.622 --> 41:32.455
I could bring a slow cooker,

41:32.457 --> 41:35.425
And we could talk about the case
all night over short ribs...?

41:35.427 --> 41:37.260
Mmm.

41:37.262 --> 41:39.262
Well, I do love short ribs.

41:39.264 --> 41:40.463
Mmm!

41:40.465 --> 41:42.532
Mmm.

41:49.107 --> 41:51.107
What is this?

41:51.109 --> 41:53.109
I'm ready.

41:53.111 --> 41:57.013
I want to,
and I want to with you.

41:57.015 --> 42:01.150
Look, I-I don't know if
we'll be together forever,

42:01.152 --> 42:04.654
Or even how long
forever is gonna be,

42:04.656 --> 42:07.123
Considering we're being
hunted down one by one, but...

42:07.125 --> 42:08.992
No matter what, I know

42:08.994 --> 42:12.195
I'll always be able to say that
my first was with a great,

42:12.197 --> 42:13.796
Great, great guy.

42:13.798 --> 42:16.165
(groans) I'm-I'm...
I'm not that great.

42:16.167 --> 42:17.500
(sighs)

42:17.502 --> 42:19.135
I'm-I'm, I'm sorry.

42:19.137 --> 42:22.038
Um, I don't understand.

42:22.040 --> 42:26.676
Um... Are you listening to me?

42:26.678 --> 42:29.145
I want this.

42:29.147 --> 42:31.047
I want<i> you.</i>

42:31.049 --> 42:33.149
I am a sentient grown woman

42:33.151 --> 42:35.318
Who has been through
hell the past few weeks,

42:35.320 --> 42:37.587
And I'm sitting
next to you, now,

42:37.589 --> 42:39.689
With open eyes
and an open heart,

42:39.691 --> 42:42.358
Telling you that I want
to give myself to you,

42:42.360 --> 42:43.593
Pete martinez.
No, no.

42:43.595 --> 42:45.328
Grace, you don't even know me.

42:45.330 --> 42:46.663
Of course I know you!

42:46.665 --> 42:48.331
Why would you say that?
What is going on?

42:48.333 --> 42:51.668
Pete? Why not, pete? Why?

42:51.670 --> 42:54.938
Pete, I... I-I love you.

42:54.940 --> 42:57.173
I can't.

42:57.175 --> 43:01.044
(sighs) because...

43:01.046 --> 43:03.780
I don't want your first time
to be with a murderer.
