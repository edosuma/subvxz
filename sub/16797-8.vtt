WEBVTT

00:15.316 --> 00:16.750
Previously on Blunt Talk...

00:16.850 --> 00:18.186
The play we'll be
reading today

00:18.286 --> 00:20.054
is Chekhov's classic
The Three Sisters.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.190
Why are you called
the Oscar Wildes?

00:22.290 --> 00:24.125
Because we're
the unfairly imprisoned.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.726
You know what else I like
is that Shelly Tinkle.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.728
Put her on-air again.
She's playful, sexy,

00:27.828 --> 00:29.330
electric.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.466
I feel like my heart
can hold both of you.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.202
I work for a private dick
named Arbogast.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.003
He tells me where to go and
what to do, but not what for.

00:36.104 --> 00:38.372
Mr. Arbogast?
Oh, shit.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.308
Looks like his head's
been bashed in.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.143
Oh, something like this
could have done it.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.945
No, Harry, put that down!

00:45.045 --> 00:47.281
Pull yourself together.
You're not Lady Macbeth.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.049
The police
will sort this out.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.119
Oh, my God, sir.
The logbook.

00:51.219 --> 00:54.488
He died clutching the logbook.
They'll think I killed him.

00:54.588 --> 00:57.225
Cuff both of them.
No, that won't be necessary.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.127
Ah!
Hey, easy with
the old man.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.661
Don't put your hands on me.

01:00.761 --> 01:03.231
Rafe!

01:18.146 --> 01:21.149
So you're very devoted
to Mr. Blunt, aren't you?

01:21.215 --> 01:24.152
Yeah, you could say that
I'm devoted to the major.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.287
And if anyone
threatened the major,

01:26.387 --> 01:30.324
that would upset you
and you would be angry
with that person, correct?

01:30.424 --> 01:32.160
Naturally.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.728
And this, uh--
this logbook,

01:34.828 --> 01:37.198
uh, can you explain
what it is?

01:37.298 --> 01:38.999
It's my life's work.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.834
So it's very
precious to you?

01:41.169 --> 01:42.736
Yes.

01:42.836 --> 01:46.807
I think of it
as the human genome
of literature.

01:46.907 --> 01:49.377
What do you mean?
Well, you see,

01:49.477 --> 01:52.880
by trying to understand
one man,

01:53.181 --> 01:55.015
Walter Blunt,

01:55.183 --> 01:58.786
like looking
at one strand of DNA,

01:58.886 --> 02:03.757
my mission has been
to comprehend all of humanity.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.826
Its delights
and its demons.

02:05.926 --> 02:09.797
Its triumphs
and its tragedies.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.500
And you ask me
if it's precious?

02:22.443 --> 02:24.412
Can I have
another milk shake?

02:36.957 --> 02:39.092
Walter, what's going on?

02:39.227 --> 02:41.562
Rosalie, I'm at LA Central.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.232
This is my one phone call.
What happened?

02:44.298 --> 02:47.235
Harry and Rafe and I
have been arrested

02:47.301 --> 02:49.136
for the murder
of Arbogast.

02:49.237 --> 02:51.572
Oh, my God!
Did you do it?

02:51.672 --> 02:53.341
No, of course not.

02:53.441 --> 02:56.076
But I can't reach my lawyer.
He's not answering his phone.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.479
That's because he's
in Romania on vacation.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.582
I'll call UBS legal,
get someone down there
right away.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.418
Mr. Blunt,
terminate the call.
You're up.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.087
Shit, uh, Rosalie,
I have to go.

03:07.255 --> 03:10.558
All right, Walter.
I-- I love you.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.260
I love you, Rosalie.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.695
Mr. Blunt.
Yes, okay.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.697
What's going on?

03:18.466 --> 03:21.269
Walter, Harry, and Rafe
have been arrested

03:21.369 --> 03:24.338
for the murder of that
private dick Arbogast.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.974
Oh, my God,
am I dreaming?

03:28.309 --> 03:30.278
What's a private dick?

03:32.280 --> 03:34.282
So explain to us again

03:34.382 --> 03:36.817
the nature
of your relationship
with Harry Chandler.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.152
It doesn't seem normal.

03:39.287 --> 03:42.356
He's my man,
my valet.

03:42.456 --> 03:45.158
My manservant
and my friend.

03:45.293 --> 03:46.427
So he's kind of
like a butler?

03:46.527 --> 03:49.297
No, it's more
personal than that.

03:49.363 --> 03:52.500
A butler usually
heads up a household.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.135
You said he was your man.
Does that mean lover?

03:55.303 --> 03:56.770
Would you lie to us
to protect him?

03:56.870 --> 03:59.206
He's not my lover!

03:59.307 --> 04:02.510
All right,
let me try and explain.

04:03.777 --> 04:07.014
Harry and I served
in the Falklands together.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.452
What's so funny?
I don't know.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.687
Whenever I hear the word
Falklands, I laugh.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.689
Where's my lawyer?
He's on his way.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.158
You don't have to talk
to us, you know.
I know that.

04:18.326 --> 04:20.428
I also know that I have
nothing to hide.

04:20.528 --> 04:23.864
I want to be cooperative.
Rudolph Global--

04:23.964 --> 04:27.335
Okay, before we
get back into your
conspiracy theories,

04:27.435 --> 04:28.869
I have another
question to ask.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.738
What is the logbook?

04:30.838 --> 04:34.342
Your man seems to be
very protective of it.

04:34.442 --> 04:38.078
Yeah, he said, um,
"It's my Swann's Way
and I'm Proust."

04:38.346 --> 04:39.347
Would he kill for it?

04:39.413 --> 04:41.615
Harry compared
himself to Proust?

04:41.715 --> 04:43.784
I thought
it was a reach myself.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.186
Well, Harry can be...

04:46.354 --> 04:48.589
irrational when it comes
to the logbook,

04:48.689 --> 04:50.924
but he would
never, ever commit--

04:51.024 --> 04:53.494
Irrational?
As in crazy?

04:56.430 --> 04:58.165
I'll wait for my lawyer.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.969
Walter, I made it.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.373
We did everything
we could

05:05.439 --> 05:07.274
to have them released
this weekend,

05:07.375 --> 05:09.276
but now they've
all been transferred

05:09.377 --> 05:11.379
to the county jail
in Chinatown.

05:11.479 --> 05:14.382
"Forget it, Jake,
it's Chinatown."

05:14.415 --> 05:16.550
This is not the time
to be quoting movies, Jim.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.086
Rosemary's Baby.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.588
Chinatown.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.790
Do they know about
Walter's bathroom issues?

05:22.890 --> 05:27.227
They do.
The one VIP privilege
we were able to swing

05:27.395 --> 05:29.397
is that Walter and Harry
can share a cell.

05:29.497 --> 05:32.733
Well, that's not too bad.
Walter won't mind going
in front of Harry.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.636
The arraignment was set
for today at 5:00,

05:35.736 --> 05:38.572
but the judge
is a nasty old tumor

05:38.672 --> 05:40.474
and he's delayed it
a week.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.543
Oh, God.
Walter must be crushed.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.613
Well, he doesn't know yet.
I have to go tell him.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.848
God, well, what are we
gonna do, Rosalie?

05:47.948 --> 05:49.316
Are we off the air?
No.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.552
I spoke to Bob
half an hour ago.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.454
He's in New York
with Bronson.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.623
They want Blunt Talk
to keep going.

05:55.723 --> 05:58.792
Bob wants--
Me to take over.

05:58.892 --> 06:02.329
Okay, I'm ready.
I just-- I just need
to shave.

06:02.430 --> 06:05.032
I love it when you shave.
Your beautiful mole comes
out of hiding.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.000
You like my mole?
Mmm.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.538
Gardner doesn't want Jim.
He wants Shelly to fill in
for Walter.

06:10.638 --> 06:14.508
Shelly?
Wait, Shelly Tinkle?

06:14.608 --> 06:16.544
That Shelly Tinkle?

06:16.644 --> 06:20.247
Yes, Martin,
this Shelly Tinkle.

06:22.450 --> 06:25.686
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

06:25.786 --> 06:29.557
Yes! Yes!
A thousand times yes.

06:29.657 --> 06:32.325
Mr. Blunt, I was wondering
if you would please,

06:32.460 --> 06:34.462
uh, lower
your boxer briefs.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.464
We have to do
a cavity check.

06:36.497 --> 06:39.500
Is this really
necessary, Officer?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.935
I am being released
this afternoon.

06:42.035 --> 06:45.473
Yeah, I'm sorry, Mr. Blunt,
but I'm going to need
you to cooperate.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.475
But surely
there are exceptions.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.743
I was held all weekend
in the precinct.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.112
I have no contraband,
no weapons.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.847
Why does everybody fight me?

06:53.947 --> 06:57.150
You know,
just-- just once,
I-I would love it

06:57.250 --> 06:58.719
if there was
no resistance.

06:58.819 --> 07:02.189
Will you please try
and see it from my perspective?

07:02.289 --> 07:05.493
No! You see this
from my perspective!

07:05.559 --> 07:09.663
If I could be
a social worker or play
the piano professionally,

07:09.763 --> 07:11.699
I would jump
at the chance.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.968
But unfortunately,
that is not where
life brought me.

07:15.068 --> 07:19.707
So please turn around,
drop your goddamn shorts.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.615
- Okay, not bad.
- You must work out.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.753
Jacks.

07:32.853 --> 07:36.023
One small bag
of marbles.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.891
Three metal army figures.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.927
Oh, I like these.

07:41.729 --> 07:44.898
One pink gumball.
One red gumball.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.334
One common fishing lure.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.136
Three Magnum condoms.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.138
I used to be
in a relationship.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.542
Tweezers.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.977
Travel sewing kit.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.979
Baby doll head.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.348
Pirate's eye patch.

08:01.549 --> 08:03.684
Tube of denture glue.

08:03.784 --> 08:06.019
Oh, that's for
the major.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.591
Rabbit's foot.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.593
Bronzed baby shoe.

08:12.693 --> 08:15.696
Bag of tomato seeds.
Yeah.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.167
Water-based lube.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.102
Same relationship.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.205
Desiccated frog.

08:25.305 --> 08:26.574
It's a desiccated toad.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.776
Desiccated toad.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.311
Rosary beads.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.781
Hershey bar.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.115
Thimble.

08:36.584 --> 08:38.619
Hand buzzer.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.921
Alcohol flask.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.422
Anything else?

08:42.590 --> 08:45.492
Oh, let me check
my left pocket.

08:45.593 --> 08:48.696
- Fresh meat!
- We got fresh meat!

08:48.796 --> 08:50.598
"In the middle of
the journey of our life,

08:50.664 --> 08:54.201
I found myself
in a dark wood where
the straight way was lost."

08:54.301 --> 08:57.504
Robert Frost?
No, sir.
Dante, the Inferno.

08:57.605 --> 09:00.841
Dante? Please, Harry,
try not to despair.
Oh, yeah.

09:00.941 --> 09:04.444
We're going to be all right.
Though I do wonder
where Rafe is.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.113
Fresh meat!
We got fresh meat!

09:06.213 --> 09:08.515
Why are they carrying on
like this, Harry?

09:08.616 --> 09:10.283
It's too early for lunch.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.719
I believe
in this instance, sir,

09:11.819 --> 09:14.421
the fresh meat
they're referring
to is us.

09:14.622 --> 09:17.290
Oh!

09:17.390 --> 09:21.061
When we get out of here,
Harry, and I finish my work
on the drought,

09:21.161 --> 09:23.964
I want to do a story
on prison reform.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.533
- Hey, Red.
- I like redheads.

09:26.634 --> 09:29.903
"Abandon all hope
ye who enter here."

09:30.003 --> 09:31.972
We'll start with
the news of the day,

09:32.072 --> 09:33.941
but then at the end
of the broadcast,

09:34.041 --> 09:36.844
I'll talk about how much
Walter has meant to me

09:36.944 --> 09:40.147
as a boss,
surrogate father,

09:40.247 --> 09:42.883
mentor,
British person.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.786
He's not dead, Shelly.
God.

09:45.886 --> 09:49.189
Hey, Jim, I was in
the middle of a thought.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.926
Please try not
to interrupt me
ever again.

09:53.026 --> 09:57.264
For the B block, we can go
with my piece on the rise of
Ivy-educated single mothers

09:57.364 --> 09:59.833
because they can't
find decent men.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.935
Uh, but what do we have
for the C block?

10:02.035 --> 10:04.504
Or as I like to call it,
the C-section.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.841
Well, I was thinking
we could go with Walter's
drought diet piece.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.342
Yes, great idea, Jim.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.278
Have you stand
next to the screen

10:11.378 --> 10:14.014
and point at a hamburger
and then tell the audience

10:14.114 --> 10:16.784
that one hamburger equals
660 gallons of water.

10:16.884 --> 10:19.152
I love that.
No.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.854
No more drought stories.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.923
The drought killed
Walter's career.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.758
I'm not gonna let it
take me down.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.794
Shelly, Walter's career
is not destroyed.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.296
Fine, whatever.
But it doesn't matter

10:29.396 --> 10:33.000
because Gardner emailed me
and he said he doesn't want
any more drought coverage.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.002
And Bronson
feels the same way.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.537
Bronson? Wow.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.940
And this is my big debut.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.542
To kick off, we need
Shelly Tinkle stories.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.113
Stories that snap.
Stories that crackle.
Stories that pop.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.982
This is a newscast,
not a breakfast cereal.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.285
Martin, you're fired.

10:52.385 --> 10:55.222
Wha-- uh,
can she do that?
Of course not.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.925
Celia, I love you,
but don't challenge me
in front of the group.

10:58.025 --> 11:01.028
Don't tell Celia not to
challenge you in front of
the group in front of the group.

11:01.128 --> 11:04.264
Don't tell me what I can do in
front of the group in front of
the group in front of the group.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.466
Am I fired or not?

11:06.734 --> 11:07.735
Not.
Not.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.203
I'm so frustrated, Harry.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.740
Try using your
Kegel muscle, sir.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.842
No, it's not that.

11:14.942 --> 11:17.010
I'm anxious
to get out of here.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.579
I need
to resume my coverage
of the drought.

11:19.747 --> 11:22.349
Oh, can you
just let go of the drought
for one moment, sir?

11:22.449 --> 11:23.784
No, I can't, Harry.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.753
The Rudolphs have
got away with murder

11:25.853 --> 11:27.254
and I have to stop them.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.958
Blunt, Chandler, lunch.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.926
It's only 10:30
in the morning.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.863
We do things
early around here.
Think of it as brunch.

11:39.366 --> 11:43.270
Hold on, Harry.
I flushed prematurely.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.606
No, no, no, no, no!

11:46.807 --> 11:48.408
I don't like any of this.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.945
None of it snaps.
None of it crackles.
None of it pops.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.347
Jesus, Shelly, what are you
gonna do on-air tonight?

11:54.447 --> 11:56.884
Read from your diary?
Jim, you're fired!

11:56.984 --> 11:59.987
How about this?
There's a study
that fatalities

12:00.087 --> 12:02.255
brought on by driving
while texting

12:02.355 --> 12:04.224
have surpassed
drunk driving deaths.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.259
Oh, yeah.

12:06.359 --> 12:09.329
Ooh, Tinkle likes this.
It's gruesome.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.798
Tell me more.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.233
Well, recently
two people in Ohio
were texting

12:13.333 --> 12:15.502
and they had a head-on
collision and died.

12:15.602 --> 12:18.571
What makes it even
more horrible and strange is
they were texting each other.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.908
Oh, see, you two?

12:21.008 --> 12:23.143
This is what
I'm looking for.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.947
And you, great work.

12:27.047 --> 12:30.483
We should, um, get
a drink in my office
after the broadcast.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.053
All right,
I'm off to wardrobe.

12:33.153 --> 12:36.256
Gardner wants me to wear
something Fox Newsy.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.891
You know, nipply.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.693
Yay!

12:43.596 --> 12:46.433
Oh, there's Rafe.
Thank God.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.201
Rafe, how are you, son?

12:49.837 --> 12:51.104
Well, let's put it
this way,

12:51.204 --> 12:53.040
it's a good thing
they took my shoelaces.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.842
It's going
to be all right.

12:54.908 --> 12:58.311
UBS legal will get us all
out of here, I promise.

12:58.411 --> 13:01.181
Yeah, but there's
a warrant for me for
that damn bar fight in Reno.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.950
I never thought it would
catch up with me.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.352
I'm looking at
at least 18 months.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.987
I can fix it, I swear.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.922
My arraignment
is this afternoon.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.524
Walter, I heard
about your troubles.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.928
Oh, Jesus.
Isn't it strange that we
should both end up here?

13:15.028 --> 13:16.964
Yes, it is strange,
Mr. Adler.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.999
Who can understand life?
Or destiny?

13:19.099 --> 13:21.101
No one, I guess.
Can I sit with you?

13:23.904 --> 13:27.540
This is Harry.
Right, uh, we met when I
took Walter hostage.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.943
Still waiting
on the grand jury
if you can believe it.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.611
And this is my son Rafe.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.546
Hey.
Nice grip.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.884
So what happened?
You crossed Rudolph Global
and they framed you?

13:36.917 --> 13:40.888
Exactly.
I always knew those bastards
were against recycled water,

13:40.954 --> 13:42.956
and the vote
for Proposition 68's
in a few days.

13:43.056 --> 13:46.994
Duncan, hey,
you have any condoms?
I'll trade you cigarettes.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.929
No, I'm sorry,
I don't, Curly.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.931
Damn.
What about you boys?

13:51.031 --> 13:52.199
No.
No.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.434
Do most prisoners
practice safe sex?

13:54.534 --> 13:56.069
I'd be reassured
to think they do.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.738
I know I do.
I'm so paranoid about STDs,

13:58.906 --> 14:00.573
I don't even like
to come on myself.

14:02.910 --> 14:06.279
So, you've acclimated
very well, Mr. Adler.

14:06.379 --> 14:10.017
Well, I'll tell you, Walter,
this place is like one big
happy orgy.

14:10.117 --> 14:12.019
Do not believe what
you hear on the outside.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.921
Most of the sex
in here is consensual.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.755
Really?
Oh, yeah.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.358
What I've learned
is there's a lot of
bisexuality in the world,

14:18.458 --> 14:21.561
but it's only in here
that the guys feel safe
enough to express it.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.764
This could be useful
for the major's story
on prison reform.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.934
Well, they have
a saying in here--

14:26.967 --> 14:29.669
a cell doesn't have
to be a closet.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.504
It's kind of beautiful.

14:31.604 --> 14:34.807
Duncan, Angel can't make it
to the reading today.

14:34.942 --> 14:37.978
He got shivved.
You're gonna have to find
somebody else to play Nina.

14:38.078 --> 14:41.381
Shivved?
Damn it, he would have been
so great in that part.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.184
He's a member
of the Oscar Wilde Players,
my theater group.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.686
You remember.
Anyways, would you
like to join?

14:46.954 --> 14:48.621
We're doing The Seagull.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.323
Except I don't
have a Nina.

14:52.159 --> 14:55.328
Um... I'll play Nina.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.365
Well, I've always
wanted to act.

14:58.465 --> 15:01.868
But my old man
pushed me into sports.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.503
Blunt,
you have a visitor.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.072
Who is it?
I don't know.

15:05.172 --> 15:07.240
I'm not
your fucking secretary.
Let's move it.

15:07.340 --> 15:11.178
Hey, Duncan,
I'm really looking
forward to the reading.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.880
Thanks, Butch.
Thanks.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.848
He's one of our
biggest fans.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.517
He'll be there later.

15:17.617 --> 15:20.153
Jim. Jim.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.322
Jim, are you there?

15:24.057 --> 15:25.993
Uh, yeah.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.995
Celia, hi. Hi.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.497
Can you believe what
a jerk Shelly's being?

15:30.597 --> 15:33.866
Yeah, I-- I know.
She's already cracking
under the pressure.

15:34.001 --> 15:37.404
Poor thing, but Tinkle
the Terrible doesn't need
to take it out on us.

15:37.504 --> 15:41.274
Maybe I should, uh,
tinkle on her bicycle
like a dog.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.311
I'm wearing the cowl.
Oh.

15:46.046 --> 15:49.416
It's-- it's nice
to hear your voice
on our private line.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.584
It's been almost
two weeks.

15:51.684 --> 15:55.088
Hey, Jim,
can I come over?
I miss your face.

15:55.188 --> 15:58.458
Yeah, com--
you can come over.
Fuck!

16:01.228 --> 16:04.031
Jim?
Or should I not?
Jim?

16:04.097 --> 16:06.633
Celia, ye-- uh, ye--
ah, God damn it!

16:06.733 --> 16:08.501
Celia, yes, come over.

16:08.601 --> 16:11.504
Celia,
come on over, yeah.

16:14.574 --> 16:17.610
Rosalie.
Walter, my poor darling.

16:17.710 --> 16:20.213
Hey, hey, no affection.

16:23.216 --> 16:26.253
What are you doing here?
My arraignment is at 5:00.

16:26.353 --> 16:29.189
It's been postponed.
Oh, fucking hell!

16:29.289 --> 16:31.158
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.526
For how long?
At least a week.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.296
The judge is making
an example of you.

16:36.396 --> 16:40.400
But the vote.
I have to get back
on-air, Rosalie.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.104
I have to.
Who's filling in
for me tonight? Jim?

16:44.204 --> 16:47.540
No. Shelly.
That's who Bob wants.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.177
Shelly?
She's too junior.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.145
Rosalie, you've got
to do something.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.547
You've got to get me
out of here.

16:54.647 --> 16:58.351
Do you give me
permission to pursue
the nuclear option?

16:58.451 --> 16:59.919
What's the nuclear option?

17:00.087 --> 17:01.888
If I told you,
you'd say no.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.256
Yes!

17:07.794 --> 17:10.197
Ahem, today's reading

17:10.297 --> 17:12.499
will be The Seagull
by Anton Chekhov.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.602
Joining us
fresh out of solitary--

17:15.702 --> 17:18.638
Mr. Tiny Luzinski
playing Servant.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.608
Tiny!

17:21.708 --> 17:24.177
Tiny.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.579
I just spoke with Rosalie.
It's not looking good.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.449
Not good at all.
They postponed
the arraignment.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.119
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Thanks, everyone.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.221
It's really good
to be out of the hole.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.123
I appreciated
all those cards.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.691
And I'll be playing
Trigorin.

17:40.227 --> 17:43.163
Please, please.
Ha, stop. Thank you.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.398
And new to
the Oscar Wilde Players,

17:45.498 --> 17:49.001
replacing Angel,
is a man who's in
for accessory to murder

17:49.136 --> 17:52.672
and assaulting
a police officer,
he's also wanted in Nevada,

17:52.772 --> 17:55.242
please welcome
Mr. Rafe Blunt
to the family!

18:00.713 --> 18:02.382
Your boy.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.353
Shelly, I have the story
ready on the virus

18:06.453 --> 18:08.688
that's only affecting
the Republican Party.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.161
Shelly,
what are you doing?

18:14.194 --> 18:15.662
What?
What are you doing?

18:15.762 --> 18:19.166
I have
the Republican virus story.
What are you doing?

18:21.434 --> 18:23.636
Martin...

18:25.172 --> 18:26.373
I'm scared.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.709
I'm scared I'm gonna fail.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.244
I always fail.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.180
Shelly, what-- what
are you talking about?

18:33.280 --> 18:36.183
All my life, I rise to
the top of whatever I do

18:36.283 --> 18:40.920
and then I sabotage it
because I don't think
I really deserve success.

18:41.188 --> 18:42.855
I deserve shit.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.193
I deserve shit.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.561
Shit.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.363
Shit.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.366
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit...

18:53.466 --> 18:55.335
Oh, my God. Shelly!
Shelly. Shelly, stop!
...shit, shit, shit, shit!

18:55.435 --> 18:58.004
Stop, please.
Martin, hold me.
I'm scared.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.406
Okay.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.708
Oh, I'm not ready
to be an anchorwoman.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.311
Or an anchorperson.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.379
You've been a jerk,
Shelly,

19:06.479 --> 19:10.217
but I won't
let you fail.
I promise.

19:11.651 --> 19:15.655
Master.
Master Trigorin.

19:17.590 --> 19:18.691
Your--

19:19.826 --> 19:21.561
your--

19:23.230 --> 19:24.331
your cane.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.366
Thank you, Yakov.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.235
How could I have
forgotten?

19:29.836 --> 19:32.439
Wait, Trigorin.

19:34.274 --> 19:37.244
I have come to
an irrevocable decision.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.878
The die is cast.

19:38.978 --> 19:42.382
I am going on the stage.

19:42.482 --> 19:46.253
I'm deserting my father.
I'm abandoning everything.

19:46.286 --> 19:50.257
I am beginning life anew.

19:50.323 --> 19:54.294
I am going
as you are to Moscow.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.728
We shall meet there.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.733
Come, come.

20:00.833 --> 20:03.936
Go to the Hotel
Slavianski Bazar.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.838
Let me know as soon
as you get there.

20:05.938 --> 20:10.377
I shall be
at Grosholski House
on Moltchanofka Street.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.312
I must go now.

20:12.412 --> 20:16.549
Just one more minute
with you, please.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.719
You are so beautiful.

20:19.819 --> 20:23.756
What bliss to think
that I shall see you
again so soon.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.394
I shall see those
glorious eyes again.

20:27.494 --> 20:31.130
That wonderful,
ineffably tender smile.

20:31.230 --> 20:35.735
Those gentle features
with their expression
of angelic purity.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.857
Yeah!

21:04.697 --> 21:07.800
Goose bumps.
I've got goose bumps.

21:07.900 --> 21:11.638
Chekhov! Chekhov!
Chekhov! Chekhov!

21:11.738 --> 21:15.975
Chekhov! Chekhov! Chekhov!
Chekhov! Chekhov! Chekhov!

21:16.075 --> 21:18.878
Chekhov! Chekhov! Chekhov!
Chekhov! Chekhov!

21:18.978 --> 21:21.448
Chekhov! Chekhov! Chekhov!
Chekhov! Chekhov! Chekhov!

21:28.054 --> 21:29.989
Jim, open up.

21:30.089 --> 21:32.959
Martin wants me
to apologize for
being an asshole

21:33.059 --> 21:35.061
and a jerk and a dick.

21:35.161 --> 21:37.497
I think that's it.
Don't forget douche.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.532
Oh, yeah, you're right.
Uh, also douche.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.634
I've-- I've been a douche.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.573
Celia!

21:46.673 --> 21:50.443
But we were supposed
to get a drink after work
so I could seduce you.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.778
Sorry, too late.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.112
I came in here to apologize

21:53.212 --> 21:55.014
because I thought
you guys were mad at me

21:55.114 --> 21:57.249
and you're in here kissing
like a bunch of schoolgirls.

21:57.384 --> 21:59.419
Just 'cause we're kissing
like schoolgirls

21:59.519 --> 22:00.953
doesn't mean
you can't apologize.

22:03.590 --> 22:06.659
I'm sorry I've been
crazy with power.

22:06.759 --> 22:10.397
Now you two have
three minutes to make out
and then it's back to work.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.465
Okay. Good. Bye.
Okay. Bye.

22:13.866 --> 22:14.834
Mmm.

22:23.476 --> 22:27.514
This prison doesn't feel
so different from
the real world.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.816
We all walk about
on our little paths

22:29.916 --> 22:33.853
thinking we're going
somewhere, but actually
going nowhere.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.856
What the hell are you
talking about, Harry?

22:36.956 --> 22:39.492
Don't depress me
even further.

22:39.592 --> 22:44.464
But being here now, sir,
I feel as if I've been
in jail all my life.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.199
My fears were the walls
of that prison.

22:47.434 --> 22:48.701
I can see that now.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.537
I don't like
this, Harry.

22:50.637 --> 22:54.240
You and Rafe
are taking to this prison
life far too easily.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.075
But not me.

22:56.175 --> 22:58.811
I shall rail against
my confinement.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.680
Oh, I know, sir, but--

23:00.780 --> 23:02.449
No, I want out, Harry.

23:02.515 --> 23:04.617
I need to fight
the Rudolphs.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.187
You got another visitor,
Mr. Blunt.

23:08.455 --> 23:10.022
Another visitor?

23:10.122 --> 23:13.826
Yeah. By the way,
your son was a great Nina.

23:13.926 --> 23:18.465
What a performance.
It was honest and real

23:18.531 --> 23:19.999
and sexy.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.806
Ronnie!

23:27.740 --> 23:30.109
Walter.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.744
What the hell
are you doing here?

23:31.844 --> 23:33.145
Rosalie--
great gal, by the way--

23:33.245 --> 23:35.615
told me to tell you that
I am your nuclear option.

23:37.484 --> 23:38.985
I don't understand.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.319
I'm your new lawyer,
Walter,

23:40.487 --> 23:42.589
and I am here to set
you and Harry free

23:42.689 --> 23:44.491
from this birdcage.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.325
What? How?

23:46.493 --> 23:48.995
I told you I used
to work for the DA

23:49.095 --> 23:50.997
and I got a lot of dirt
on this judge,

23:51.097 --> 23:53.500
so it was easy twisting
his nipples to get you
out on bail.

23:53.566 --> 23:56.669
What about my son?
First of all,
you're welcome.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.738
With Rafe, I hit
a roadblock.

23:58.838 --> 24:01.708
I don't have pull in Reno,
but I'm working on it.

24:01.808 --> 24:04.110
So when can Harry and I
get out of this place?

24:04.210 --> 24:05.377
Now.

24:05.512 --> 24:07.847
Get your things
and meet me out front.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.349
Could you take me
to UBS?

24:10.517 --> 24:12.819
I could still make
the broadcast.
Of course.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.954
You're a client now.
You've got privileges.

24:15.054 --> 24:18.224
Ronnie, I have
underestimated you.

24:18.324 --> 24:20.259
Good, because you haven't
seen my bill yet.

24:25.732 --> 24:28.200
Rafe, I need
to talk to you.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.538
Yeah, okay.
Duncan and I are just
working on tomorrow's play.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.873
Our Town.
I'm playing Emily,

24:33.973 --> 24:36.576
a young woman who dies
in childbirth.

24:36.676 --> 24:37.977
He's perfect for it.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.946
Your son has a lot
of talent, Walter.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.549
Thank you. Rafe--
You surprised me
with that kiss today.

24:42.582 --> 24:45.084
I wasn't expecting tongue.
Good thing I brushed my teeth.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.620
Rafe, please.
I need a moment.

24:49.556 --> 24:50.757
Yeah, what is it?

24:50.857 --> 24:52.559
Harry and I are getting
out of this place.

24:52.659 --> 24:55.562
We got a new lawyer.
Unfortunately...

24:55.595 --> 24:57.063
he couldn't get
you released.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.599
Oh...
But he's on it.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.569
Okay, Dad.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.003
I'll be fine.

25:07.574 --> 25:08.775
Duncan's here.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.277
I love you, Rafe.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.687
Shelly, are you ready?

25:20.787 --> 25:22.454
I'm ready.
I'm more than ready.

25:22.589 --> 25:24.190
Good.
You look wonderful.

25:24.290 --> 25:27.226
Your nipples
are fantastic.
Oh, thanks, Rosalie.

25:27.326 --> 25:29.996
You'll start with
Hurricane Shiloh.

25:30.096 --> 25:33.132
It just got upgraded
to a level four.
Got it.

25:33.232 --> 25:36.135
Uh, I made a few edits
to Martin's Republican
virus story.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.604
Excellent.
You're amazing, Jim.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.606
Here are the latest facts
on texting deaths.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.908
Thank you, Celia.
You're as smart
as you are beautiful.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.876
Oh, my God, Shelly.
Your nipples look great.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.511
I know, Rosalie
already told me.

25:45.612 --> 25:47.614
That's because we have
the same taste in nipples.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.049
We sure do.
Rosalie! Everyone!

25:50.149 --> 25:51.517
Walter.
We made it.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.485
I don't need make-up.
I just need to be wired.

25:53.620 --> 25:56.355
Shelly, go to the desk.
Everyone else,
to your stations.

25:56.623 --> 25:57.890
But Walter--
Now!

25:57.990 --> 25:59.692
What's going on?
I texted you.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.260
I told you Ronnie
got us released.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.630
I know.
I called Gardner
immediately,

26:03.696 --> 26:07.634
but until all
the charges are dropped,
you are suspended.

26:07.700 --> 26:11.037
No! I need to broadcast.
To hell with Gardner.

26:11.137 --> 26:14.206
You can't do that, Walter.
You'll destroy everything.

26:14.306 --> 26:16.242
But-- but, Rosalie,
th-- the Rudolphs--

26:16.342 --> 26:19.245
Walter, please.
You are suspended.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.180
I don't care.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.018
Major.

26:26.118 --> 26:29.488
Major, you have
to listen to Rosalie.

26:29.656 --> 26:31.223
The time to fight
will come.

26:33.059 --> 26:36.829
Three, two, one.

26:36.929 --> 26:39.666
Good evening and welcome
to Blunt Talk.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.033
Filling in
for Walter Blunt,

26:41.133 --> 26:44.036
this is Shelly Tinkle
doing her thing.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.739
Off the Gulf Coast
of Florida, Hurricane Shiloh

26:46.839 --> 26:50.042
is rapidly gaining strength
and Floridians are once again

26:50.142 --> 26:52.879
girding themselves
for yet another superstorm

26:52.979 --> 26:55.447
in these most
catastrophic of times.
