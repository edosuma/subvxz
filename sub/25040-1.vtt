Come on.

00:57.523 --> 00:58.523
Come on!

01:08.953 --> 01:10.511
Don't let him get away!

01:57.456 --> 01:58.790
Get inside now!

01:58.830 --> 02:00.700
Hurry up! You're late!

02:03.538 --> 02:05.607
Proxima's gonna
have your hide.

02:06.923 --> 02:08.449
Get back in the den.

02:10.758 --> 02:11.932
Look what I stole!

02:11.972 --> 02:13.983
Proxima'll give me
an extra portion for this!

02:14.023 --> 02:15.955
Nope, I think she's gonna
give that extra portion to me.

02:15.979 --> 02:16.809
Hey, give it back!

02:16.849 --> 02:17.999
It belongs to
whoever's holding it!

02:18.023 --> 02:18.909
And that's not you!

02:18.949 --> 02:20.145
Lex!

02:20.463 --> 02:21.531
Full Sabacc!

02:21.571 --> 02:22.876
Idiot's Array.

02:22.916 --> 02:23.941
What? Let me see that!

02:23.965 --> 02:25.045
Nope, it's my card.

02:25.085 --> 02:26.097
You cheat.

02:26.997 --> 02:27.997
Han!

02:32.048 --> 02:33.510
You were gone too long!

02:33.572 --> 02:35.019
I knew something
must've gone wrong.

02:35.059 --> 02:36.626
This is nothing.
You should see them.

02:36.666 --> 02:37.701
Look down here!

02:39.105 --> 02:40.137
All right, listen.

02:40.177 --> 02:41.522
I was in the middle
of the exchange,

02:41.546 --> 02:42.668
I'm handing over
the coaxium

02:42.708 --> 02:44.512
and his goons jumped me,
but I showed 'em.

02:44.552 --> 02:45.148
How?

02:45.188 --> 02:47.324
I ran away, then I
boosted their speeder.

02:47.364 --> 02:48.400
What, are we
going somewhere?

02:48.424 --> 02:50.193
Yeah, anywhere we want.

02:51.184 --> 02:53.700
You held on to
one of the vials?

02:53.881 --> 02:54.882
Han's back!

02:57.110 --> 02:58.707
This,
this is worth...

02:58.747 --> 02:59.698
Five, six hundred credits.

02:59.738 --> 03:01.902
That's more than
you said we'd need.

03:01.963 --> 03:04.142
To buy our way out
of the control zone.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.574
And off Corellia.

03:05.614 --> 03:08.682
Han, this could work.

03:08.722 --> 03:09.808
This is gonna work.

03:09.848 --> 03:12.378
Qi'ra, you always said one day
we're gonna get out of here.

03:12.680 --> 03:13.714
This is it.

03:15.132 --> 03:16.535
What are we waiting for?

03:21.670 --> 03:24.098
There he is.
Hey, you two!

03:27.348 --> 03:29.014
Moloch. Hi, how are ya?

03:29.054 --> 03:31.302
I was just on my way
to see Lady Proxima.

03:33.970 --> 03:36.384
What a night I had.

03:36.461 --> 03:38.613
You're not gonna believe it.
You'll believe it, but...

03:39.591 --> 03:41.754
Hold still, scrumrat!

03:43.344 --> 03:44.358
Easy.

03:45.601 --> 03:46.519
Come on.

03:46.559 --> 03:47.647
All right.

03:48.249 --> 03:49.902
Let's go see Lady Proxima.

04:10.706 --> 04:13.497
Well, what happened?

04:13.537 --> 04:14.834
I'll tell you what happened.

04:14.874 --> 04:17.043
They double-crossed you
and tried to kill me.

04:17.084 --> 04:17.882
The money?

04:17.922 --> 04:20.694
- They kept it.
- And my coaxium?

04:21.158 --> 04:21.781
They kept that, too.

04:21.822 --> 04:23.786
But we learned
a very valuable lesson.

04:23.826 --> 04:26.427
We cannot trust those guys.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.293
So you expect me to believe

04:28.379 --> 04:30.929
that you walked away
with nothing!

04:32.574 --> 04:35.219
I ran away with my life.
I think that's something.

04:35.912 --> 04:37.418
To me, that's a lot.

04:37.465 --> 04:39.725
I trusted you
with a simple task,

04:39.765 --> 04:42.501
and all I'm hearing
are excuses.

04:45.122 --> 04:48.831
There must be consequences
for disobedience

04:48.871 --> 04:51.696
or else you never learn.

04:57.881 --> 04:58.881
You know what?

05:00.622 --> 05:02.213
I don't think
I'm ever gonna learn.

05:02.253 --> 05:03.888
What did you say?

05:03.990 --> 05:08.311
I said, next time
somebody hits me,

05:09.001 --> 05:10.762
I hit 'em back.

05:13.437 --> 05:14.855
Moloch, wait!

05:15.079 --> 05:16.221
Don't!

05:16.261 --> 05:18.741
Qi'ra, remember the Silo?

05:18.847 --> 05:20.616
We pulled you
out of that horror,

05:20.656 --> 05:22.158
gave you a home.

05:22.198 --> 05:25.874
Don't throw it away for Han.
He's not worth it!

05:25.914 --> 05:29.367
Whatever he lost on the deal,
we'll earn it back, double.

05:29.407 --> 05:30.694
We will make it up to you.

05:34.944 --> 05:37.245
Everybody, stand back!

05:37.285 --> 05:39.028
What's that supposed to be?

05:39.114 --> 05:40.712
This is a thermal detonator

05:40.752 --> 05:43.247
that I just armed.

05:43.287 --> 05:45.949
- That's a rock!
- No, it's not.

05:46.019 --> 05:46.812
Yes, it is!

05:46.852 --> 05:47.713
And you just made

05:47.753 --> 05:49.477
a clicking sound
with your mouth.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.241
Please tell me
this isn't your plan.

05:51.281 --> 05:52.620
No, this is.

06:02.829 --> 06:04.384
- Get in!
- An M-68?

06:04.424 --> 06:06.226
- Nice, right?
- I love it!

06:14.044 --> 06:15.479
Whoa!

06:39.245 --> 06:42.045
There's a starliner leaving
from Coronet Spaceport,

06:42.085 --> 06:43.320
we're gonna be on it.

06:44.198 --> 06:47.001
We bribe our way through the
checkpoint, and we're free.

06:48.570 --> 06:50.050
I'm gonna be a pilot.

06:50.402 --> 06:51.518
We can get our own ship.

06:51.558 --> 06:53.436
See the galaxy,
all of it.

06:54.425 --> 06:58.254
We won't have to take orders
or be kicked around by anyone.

06:58.674 --> 06:59.675
Ever.

07:03.057 --> 07:05.225
Thought we'd get a little
more of a head start.

07:22.052 --> 07:23.372
- Whoa!
- Hang on!

07:33.020 --> 07:34.704
<i>This is a secure area.</i>

07:34.744 --> 07:36.830
<i>You must have
proper clearance.</i>

07:36.870 --> 07:39.612
<i>Stop at once! You must
follow the proper...</i>

07:40.583 --> 07:41.759
<i>Protocol.</i>

07:44.558 --> 07:46.440
Damn!
That stinger's fast.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.910
Yeah, but we're faster,
right?

07:49.320 --> 07:50.390
I hope so.

08:20.690 --> 08:21.883
<i>Pull over!</i>

08:44.101 --> 08:45.373
Han, no,
we're not gonna make it!

08:45.397 --> 08:46.130
Oh, yeah?

08:46.170 --> 08:47.899
Han, I'm telling you,
it's too tight!

08:48.024 --> 08:49.404
Watch this.

09:13.449 --> 09:14.449
Come on!

09:15.502 --> 09:16.670
We gotta move.

09:28.145 --> 09:29.612
<i>Do not join the line</i>

09:29.680 --> 09:32.410
<i>if you don't have
a boarding pass.</i>

09:32.513 --> 09:36.011
<i>No access without ID chip.</i>

09:36.255 --> 09:39.261
<i>All droids
must be registered.</i>

09:40.710 --> 09:42.381
<i>Move along. Move along.</i>

09:44.865 --> 09:46.925
<i>Stand down. Do not resist!</i>

09:48.089 --> 09:49.651
- <i>Stop struggling.</i>
- Let me go!

09:49.708 --> 09:50.620
<i>Take his arm.</i>

09:50.660 --> 09:51.388
<i>I got him.</i>

09:51.452 --> 09:53.559
<i>Take him to cell 3B.</i>

09:53.599 --> 09:54.920
<i>This way, come on.</i>

09:55.841 --> 09:57.409
<i>Keep moving.
Hold it, hold it.</i>

09:59.753 --> 10:00.887
Next.

10:05.136 --> 10:06.871
Han, they're here.

10:09.770 --> 10:10.547
<i>Hey, what are you...</i>

10:10.587 --> 10:13.614
We're almost there.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.619
- Just hold on to me.
- Next.

10:15.659 --> 10:16.693
Don't look back.

10:17.736 --> 10:20.243
Once we're through,
we've gotta be smart,

10:20.329 --> 10:21.753
figure out
where we're going.

10:21.812 --> 10:23.768
Anywhere the Empire isn't.
Wherever we go,

10:23.814 --> 10:25.327
it can't be worse
than where we've been.

10:25.351 --> 10:28.815
Yes, it can. Out there,
we've got no protection.

10:28.855 --> 10:30.985
We could get snatched up
by traffickers,

10:31.025 --> 10:33.554
sold to Crimson Dawn
or the Hutt Cartel.

10:33.594 --> 10:35.712
That's not gonna happen.

10:35.794 --> 10:36.963
I won't let it.

10:44.673 --> 10:45.673
For luck?

10:46.709 --> 10:48.006
Damn right.

10:51.762 --> 10:53.128
<i>You heard him. Let's go.</i>

10:53.152 --> 10:54.342
Next.

10:57.159 --> 10:58.684
ID chips.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.820
Funny thing,
we don't have 'em.

11:01.259 --> 11:02.182
We have this.

11:02.222 --> 11:03.705
Refined hyperfuel.

11:03.745 --> 11:06.667
It's worth at least
800 credits, maybe more.

11:08.071 --> 11:10.337
You could be detained
just for having that.

11:10.377 --> 11:12.169
What good would
that do anybody?

11:12.394 --> 11:14.240
Let us through,
it's all yours.

11:23.854 --> 11:25.851
The coaxium, now.

11:25.937 --> 11:27.473
As we're going through,
not before.

11:32.805 --> 11:34.006
Do it.

11:36.048 --> 11:37.183
Just do it, do it.

11:41.230 --> 11:43.745
Not so fast, Qi'ra!
Come on!

11:43.817 --> 11:45.406
Wait!
Open the door!

11:45.458 --> 11:47.977
Security! Security,
there has been a breach!

11:48.078 --> 11:49.413
Open the door!

11:49.685 --> 11:51.949
- Run! Run!
- Get your hands off of her!

11:52.169 --> 11:53.224
Run!

11:53.304 --> 11:55.055
Get your hands off of her!

11:55.696 --> 11:56.888
Qi'ra!

11:56.928 --> 11:59.259
Run, Han! Go!

11:59.362 --> 12:00.693
Keep moving.

12:02.779 --> 12:04.063
Qi'ra!

12:04.103 --> 12:05.032
Run!

12:05.072 --> 12:06.474
<i>Traveler
has been apprehended.</i>

12:06.498 --> 12:09.776
Qi'ra, I'll come back!
I'll come back!

12:12.390 --> 12:14.374
<i>All units,
there has been a breach.</i>

12:14.514 --> 12:18.316
<i>Another unauthorized traveler
made it through the gate.</i>

12:18.356 --> 12:19.830
One got through
the gate! Look over there!

12:19.854 --> 12:21.985
<i>Someone
got through the checkpoint.</i>

12:29.723 --> 12:32.020
- Keep an eye on that gate.
- Yes, sir.

12:32.138 --> 12:33.449
Can't let you through
without a ticket.

12:33.473 --> 12:35.008
Can't let you through
without a ticket.

12:35.973 --> 12:37.525
Hey, wait!

12:37.666 --> 12:39.156
- Hey!
<i>- Come with us.</i>

12:41.686 --> 12:43.687
<i>He's still
out there. Keep looking.</i>

12:55.783 --> 12:57.110
<i>You there, stop!</i>

12:57.150 --> 12:59.763
- <i>Show me some identification.</i>
- Please. Please. No, no!

12:59.813 --> 13:00.994
<i>Do not resist.</i>

13:01.034 --> 13:04.416
<i>Be a part of something.
Join the Empire.</i>

13:04.565 --> 13:08.975
<i>Explore new worlds.
Learn valuable skills.</i>

13:09.040 --> 13:12.805
<i>Bring order and unity
to the galaxy!</i>

13:12.860 --> 13:16.179
<i>Be a part of something.
Join the Empire.</i>

13:17.583 --> 13:19.406
This is where I sign up
to be a pilot, right?

13:19.446 --> 13:20.990
If you apply
for the Imperial Navy,

13:21.030 --> 13:22.825
but most recruits
go into the infantry.

13:22.865 --> 13:25.981
I'm gonna be a pilot.
Best in the galaxy.

13:26.021 --> 13:27.784
You there,
come with us.

13:27.824 --> 13:28.887
Who, me?

13:28.974 --> 13:30.773
We have a few questions
to ask you.

13:30.827 --> 13:32.562
How long
is that gonna take?

13:32.602 --> 13:35.041
Depends on how good you are
at following orders.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.477
Why, have you got
somewhere to be?

13:36.517 --> 13:38.675
Yeah, back here,
as soon as I can.

13:39.799 --> 13:43.129
Don't hear that much.
What's your name, son?

13:43.210 --> 13:44.212
Han.

13:44.596 --> 13:45.963
Han what?

13:47.713 --> 13:48.926
Who are your people?

13:52.709 --> 13:55.479
I don't have people.
I'm alone.

13:56.681 --> 13:57.682
Han...

14:00.696 --> 14:01.816
Solo.

14:03.584 --> 14:04.871
Approved.

14:05.012 --> 14:08.703
Proceed to transport ID 83 for
the Naval Academy at Carida.

14:09.334 --> 14:11.222
Good luck, Han Solo.

14:11.325 --> 14:12.842
We'll have you flying
in no time.

14:26.464 --> 14:29.929
Your Empire needs you.
Troopers forward!

14:30.132 --> 14:32.028
Solo, get up!
We're almost there!

14:32.119 --> 14:34.549
Almost where?
Where are we going?

14:34.620 --> 14:37.501
Just over that last ridge.
Victory is...

14:47.779 --> 14:51.049
My legs! My leg!

15:06.745 --> 15:08.455
<i>Hey, Beckett,
you said we were here</i>

15:08.495 --> 15:09.811
<i>to pull a quick job.</i>

15:09.851 --> 15:11.789
- Yeah.
- <i>Well, this ain't a quick job!</i>

15:11.829 --> 15:13.236
<i>It's a war!</i>

15:14.104 --> 15:15.792
It's always
something with you.

15:17.444 --> 15:20.342
AT-hauler.
That's what we came for.

15:20.382 --> 15:22.760
Forward operations
must be this way.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.429
They are, but the major said
we're supposed to go that way!

15:25.485 --> 15:27.444
Yeah, go that way and die!

15:27.485 --> 15:30.047
That's exactly what happened
to the major!

15:30.184 --> 15:32.389
Who's the ranking
officer now?

15:32.500 --> 15:34.119
You are, Captain.

15:36.131 --> 15:37.569
<i>He's got you there.</i>

15:39.499 --> 15:41.943
So what's the plan,
Captain Beckett?

15:42.022 --> 15:45.294
Val, you take Rio and these
four mud skulls flank left.

15:45.356 --> 15:46.885
I'll take this
mouthy scooch

15:46.996 --> 15:48.169
and we'll go around
to the right

15:48.193 --> 15:50.372
and maybe
we'll get lucky.

15:50.425 --> 15:52.089
<i>Luck's got
nothin' to do with it.</i>

15:52.825 --> 15:55.120
Wait! One question!

15:55.239 --> 15:57.402
- You wanna live, sparky?
- Very much.

15:57.442 --> 15:59.930
Then shut up and do what
your captain tells you.

16:00.559 --> 16:02.219
Let's go!

16:16.508 --> 16:17.260
Captain.

16:17.300 --> 16:19.612
<i>T-15s are down.
We walk from here.</i>

16:19.670 --> 16:20.772
Captain.

16:22.986 --> 16:24.053
I'm Han.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.745
Nobody cares.

16:28.328 --> 16:30.289
Thanks for your help
back there.

16:30.384 --> 16:31.587
You did all right.

16:32.496 --> 16:34.225
I was trained
in aerial combat...

16:34.265 --> 16:36.174
You want some advice?

16:36.247 --> 16:37.442
Get the hell
away from here.

16:37.482 --> 16:40.018
Any way you can,
as fast as you can.

16:43.406 --> 16:44.336
What company
do you command?

16:44.376 --> 16:46.112
None of your business
company.

16:46.643 --> 16:48.019
And we're full up.

16:48.995 --> 16:50.411
<i>Stick
to soldiering, kid.</i>

16:50.491 --> 16:51.893
<i>You don't want
any part of this.</i>

16:58.498 --> 16:59.734
<i>Hang on, guys!</i>

17:01.931 --> 17:03.302
Attention!

17:03.704 --> 17:06.605
In three hours, we move out
for the southern marshlands.

17:06.666 --> 17:09.262
I want an advance party
of ten men.

17:09.342 --> 17:11.145
Great, more mud.

17:11.215 --> 17:13.345
What was that?

17:13.479 --> 17:16.194
Just wondering what our
objective is, Lieutenant.

17:16.259 --> 17:19.056
Bring peace and prosperity
to the galaxy,

17:19.143 --> 17:21.049
install a regime
loyal to the Emperor,

17:21.089 --> 17:23.095
and eradicate
the hostiles.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.391
It's their planet,
we're the hostiles.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.643
You got a problem, trooper?

17:28.832 --> 17:30.200
No problem, sir.

17:32.951 --> 17:34.179
Moving out.

17:34.438 --> 17:37.077
To the southern
marshlands! Move out!

17:37.168 --> 17:39.137
You heard 'em!
Let's move out!

17:47.637 --> 17:49.388
Mmm. Looks like
they're running sorties

17:49.412 --> 17:51.000
every 30 minutes.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.510
Yeah, I can take out the
guards at the perimeter,

17:53.550 --> 17:54.865
signalman, pilot.

17:54.905 --> 17:56.354
Hell, I'll just
take 'em all out.

17:56.480 --> 17:57.783
What are we
looking at?

18:01.399 --> 18:03.362
You have a talent for
sticking your nose in

18:03.402 --> 18:04.810
where it doesn't belong.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.412
I just couldn't help
but notice

18:06.452 --> 18:08.723
you're wearing a uniform
pock-full of laser burns.

18:08.764 --> 18:11.274
So either
you heal real quick

18:11.352 --> 18:13.462
or you stole it off
a dead man.

18:13.502 --> 18:15.637
You're not Imperial Army.

18:15.725 --> 18:17.160
You're thieves here
to steal equipment

18:17.184 --> 18:19.013
for a job and I want in.

18:19.505 --> 18:21.441
- Well, now we gotta shoot him.
- No.

18:22.406 --> 18:24.542
Snap his neck.
It's less mess.

18:24.616 --> 18:25.957
Or you take me with you.

18:25.997 --> 18:28.710
Look, I came up running scams
on the streets of Corellia.

18:28.819 --> 18:31.215
I was boosting AV-21s
when I was ten.

18:31.255 --> 18:33.095
I'm a driver, a flyer,

18:33.159 --> 18:36.585
and hey, you said yourself.
I gotta get outta here. Right?

18:36.641 --> 18:39.156
<i>What's a fancy flyboy
doing down in the mud?</i>

18:40.307 --> 18:42.422
I got kicked out
of the Imperial Academy

18:42.505 --> 18:44.016
for having
a mind of my own.

18:44.118 --> 18:47.535
But I am a great pilot.
And I gotta get home.

18:47.603 --> 18:50.175
<i>This guy is nuts. No
one goes back to Corellia.</i>

18:50.232 --> 18:51.671
I got a reason.

18:51.741 --> 18:53.837
We've already
got a great pilot.

18:54.018 --> 18:56.466
The Ardennian.

18:56.506 --> 18:58.639
<i>Ardennian?
You got a lot of nerve, pal.</i>

18:58.709 --> 19:00.103
<i>I'm an Imperial trooper.</i>

19:00.166 --> 19:01.362
Oh, really?
A couple of your arms

19:01.386 --> 19:02.198
popped out of your butt

19:02.238 --> 19:03.969
and hiked up your pants,
trooper.

19:04.009 --> 19:04.768
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

19:04.808 --> 19:07.212
Look, I'll do whatever it
takes to get back to Corellia.

19:07.252 --> 19:08.488
I've already been away
too long.

19:08.512 --> 19:10.431
Just give me a shot.

19:10.948 --> 19:12.176
<i>Whoa. Hold it.</i>

19:14.196 --> 19:15.663
Well, if you're
not interested in me,

19:15.703 --> 19:18.699
I think the lieutenant might
be very interested in you.

19:22.473 --> 19:23.775
Blackmail.

19:26.211 --> 19:27.180
Lieutenant.

19:27.220 --> 19:28.220
Captain.

19:29.214 --> 19:31.760
Lieutenant, we have
apprehended a deserter.

19:31.800 --> 19:32.707
Take him.

19:32.747 --> 19:33.538
Wait.

19:33.578 --> 19:36.548
I should've known.
This one's a troublemaker.

19:36.588 --> 19:38.782
And a liar. Don't
believe anything he says.

19:38.822 --> 19:40.950
- Don't go anywhere without me.
<i>- All right, let's go.</i>

19:40.974 --> 19:42.199
Feed him to the beast.

19:42.243 --> 19:43.926
The beast?
Wait, there's a beast?

19:43.966 --> 19:45.175
- Hold on!
<i>- Move it!</i>

19:45.215 --> 19:47.430
Listen, that guy's not
even an officer. All right?

19:47.470 --> 19:48.806
- He was lying!
<i>- Quiet!</i>

19:50.600 --> 19:51.601
<i>Don't care.</i>

19:54.478 --> 19:56.246
<i>Haven't fed
him in three days.</i>

19:56.286 --> 19:57.540
<i>Should be fun.</i>

20:44.098 --> 20:46.495
Oh! Hey!
Hey, big fella.

20:46.535 --> 20:49.244
Just calm down.
Take it easy.

20:49.354 --> 20:50.838
We're on the same side.

20:50.933 --> 20:52.593
You like treats?

20:54.173 --> 20:56.643
Help!
Let me out of here!

20:56.683 --> 20:57.852
Let me out of here!

21:01.357 --> 21:02.993
A-ha! Gotcha!

21:09.171 --> 21:10.407
Ahhh!

21:23.900 --> 21:25.693
<i>Ah, this was
just getting good.</i>

21:25.733 --> 21:27.081
<i>- He killed him too fast.
- Yeah!</i>

21:27.122 --> 21:28.422
<i>Kill him slower.</i>

21:31.217 --> 21:32.663
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

21:32.703 --> 21:35.266
Wait! Wait!

21:39.002 --> 21:40.108
Yeah, I speak a little.

21:40.149 --> 21:43.067
Now just listen to me, you...

22:01.729 --> 22:03.448
Yes, yes!

22:04.121 --> 22:05.358
No, no, no, no!

22:08.192 --> 22:09.193
Do it!

22:09.375 --> 22:10.478
Come on.

22:12.154 --> 22:13.849
Oh, no!

22:14.211 --> 22:16.029
<i>Ten credits, he doesn't
last another minute.</i>

22:16.101 --> 22:17.929
Let me out of here!

22:18.048 --> 22:19.726
I can't take it anymore!

22:20.878 --> 22:22.971
- Oh, no! Stop, please!
- <i>That's it. Get him!</i>

22:23.780 --> 22:27.728
You tired, you mangy
Kashyyykian moof-milker?

22:38.937 --> 22:41.486
See what happens
when you listen to me?

22:41.526 --> 22:43.474
Hey, what are you doing?

22:45.850 --> 22:47.518
Ow.

22:50.693 --> 22:51.694
Follow me!

23:02.751 --> 23:03.999
Wait, wait.

23:04.039 --> 23:05.934
Come here.
Listen to me.

23:05.974 --> 23:06.932
You don't understand,
okay?

23:06.972 --> 23:07.874
I have some
very good friends

23:07.914 --> 23:09.034
waiting for me
at that airfield.

23:09.058 --> 23:10.455
They're leaving
right now.

23:10.495 --> 23:12.174
That's our one way
off this mud ball.

23:12.214 --> 23:13.850
If you wanna live,
we go that way.

23:13.890 --> 23:16.363
After that, you go whichever
way you want, I don't care!

23:16.403 --> 23:18.511
But right now,
that's the way you go!

23:20.940 --> 23:22.275
Trust me!

23:22.880 --> 23:25.237
Val, let's go!

23:28.563 --> 23:31.477
How do they breathe in these
suits? It's so stuffy!

23:31.735 --> 23:33.432
No wonder
they're such lousy pilots.

23:33.472 --> 23:35.164
You can't turn your head,
you can't breathe,

23:35.188 --> 23:36.578
you can't hear each other!

23:43.517 --> 23:45.023
I'll be damned.

23:45.117 --> 23:46.528
Hey, look who's back!

23:46.601 --> 23:47.841
Unbelievable!

23:47.935 --> 23:49.654
Wait!

23:49.694 --> 23:51.552
Wait!

23:51.599 --> 23:54.225
Whoa, is that a Wookiee?
Incredible!

23:54.265 --> 23:55.589
I'll say it, I don't care.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.164
This kid's growing on me.

23:57.337 --> 23:59.138
Wait!

24:03.044 --> 24:03.791
You know, we could always use

24:03.831 --> 24:05.846
some muscle
on a job like this.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.866
Don't even
think about it!

24:07.942 --> 24:10.299
I'm telling you, you will
never have a deeper sleep

24:10.339 --> 24:12.065
than curled up
in a Wookiee's lap.

24:17.928 --> 24:20.685
I told you!

24:20.725 --> 24:22.813
Very good friends!

24:48.011 --> 24:50.448
We couldn't have done this
maybe, like, one at a time?

25:18.626 --> 25:20.360
Thanks for helping me
get outta there.

25:26.716 --> 25:28.651
No, they only took you
because of me.

25:29.831 --> 25:30.975
Hey!

25:31.095 --> 25:33.726
I got us
a real sweet deal here.

25:33.821 --> 25:35.780
We do this one job
with them,

25:35.889 --> 25:37.685
we make some real money,

25:37.879 --> 25:39.888
and then we're free.

25:40.170 --> 25:42.038
When's the last time
you could say that?

25:45.476 --> 25:47.746
Been a while
for me, too.

25:49.173 --> 25:51.472
So what's your name,
anyway?

25:54.816 --> 25:57.242
Chewbacca?

25:57.338 --> 25:59.628
All right, well, you're gonna
need a nickname,

25:59.706 --> 26:01.441
'cause I ain't saying that
every time.

26:07.252 --> 26:08.705
Here it comes.
Take a look.

26:08.745 --> 26:09.387
Yeah.

26:09.427 --> 26:13.322
We hit the Conveyex between
the tower and the bridge.

26:13.384 --> 26:16.564
Rio drops us in, we separate
the payload container,

26:16.605 --> 26:19.195
cable it up to the AT-hauler
and then...

26:19.235 --> 26:21.089
Rio jams
their distress signal.

26:21.772 --> 26:22.872
I blow the bridge,

26:22.912 --> 26:24.806
the container slides
right off the track

26:24.846 --> 26:26.259
and we sail away.

26:26.299 --> 26:28.064
You trip that security beam,

26:28.104 --> 26:29.227
wake up those Vipers,

26:29.267 --> 26:31.690
it's liable to get
real spicy, real fast.

26:31.752 --> 26:33.912
Well, I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

26:33.990 --> 26:35.372
Enfys Nest.

26:35.466 --> 26:36.831
What's an Enfys Nest?

26:36.907 --> 26:38.002
I told you,
we're way ahead

26:38.042 --> 26:39.826
of the competition
on this one.

26:39.888 --> 26:41.083
There's no way Enfys Nest

26:41.123 --> 26:43.186
even knows
about this shipment.

26:43.351 --> 26:44.949
Only my guy
has the intel.

26:44.989 --> 26:47.480
Well, you better
be right. Yeah?

26:47.556 --> 26:49.693
Because sometimes,
you put your faith

26:49.783 --> 26:51.117
in the wrong people.

26:53.353 --> 26:55.843
<i>Our whole future
depends on this one score</i>

26:55.883 --> 26:57.201
<i>and you bring in amateurs.</i>

26:57.256 --> 26:58.499
<i>In case you hadn't noticed,</i>

26:58.523 --> 27:00.166
<i>we're a little shorthanded.</i>

27:00.236 --> 27:01.691
So we get who we need.

27:01.762 --> 27:04.219
The Xan sisters, or Bossk.

27:04.279 --> 27:06.550
But, no, instead you're
putting our lives

27:06.590 --> 27:08.167
in the hands of morons.

27:09.210 --> 27:10.537
You guys morons?

27:10.616 --> 27:11.429
No!

27:11.469 --> 27:13.615
- No. See?
- We're not morons.

27:13.655 --> 27:16.630
Look, I waited a long time
for a shot like this.

27:16.670 --> 27:18.476
I'm not about to screw it up,
all right?

27:19.307 --> 27:20.436
Oh, come on, Val!

27:20.508 --> 27:22.114
He looks so sincere.

27:22.161 --> 27:23.541
Plus, have you ever
tried to disinvite

27:23.565 --> 27:24.661
a Wookiee to anything?

27:24.701 --> 27:27.231
Not a good idea!

27:27.312 --> 27:28.621
This is not funny!

27:28.787 --> 27:33.151
Look, now, I have great
instincts about these guys.

27:33.475 --> 27:37.065
And, besides,
do you see any other options?

27:37.105 --> 27:38.469
I just hope you know
what you're doing.

27:38.493 --> 27:41.257
Yeah, I know exactly
what I'm doing and why.

27:41.323 --> 27:43.151
We're gonna
clear our debts,

27:43.191 --> 27:45.104
go back to Glee Anselm,

27:46.061 --> 27:48.824
and I'm finally gonna learn
how to play that valachord.

27:48.864 --> 27:51.052
Babe, you're never gonna learn
how to play the valachord.

27:51.076 --> 27:52.905
She's right.
You are tone-deaf.

27:56.470 --> 27:58.838
So what's your sob story,
flyboy?

27:58.878 --> 27:59.752
Who, me?

27:59.793 --> 28:01.790
You're after something,
I know the look.

28:01.830 --> 28:03.485
What is it?
Revenge?

28:04.459 --> 28:05.957
No, it's not revenge.

28:06.223 --> 28:07.551
Look at him.

28:07.677 --> 28:09.239
If it's anything,
it's a girl.

28:09.279 --> 28:10.261
Oh, a girl!

28:10.301 --> 28:12.867
Tell us about the girl, Han.
Is she nice?

28:13.461 --> 28:15.126
Does she have sharp teeth?

28:18.406 --> 28:19.608
There was a girl.

28:19.959 --> 28:23.248
But I got out,
she didn't.

28:25.170 --> 28:27.967
I swore to myself
I'd become a pilot,

28:28.289 --> 28:30.054
get a ship,

28:30.159 --> 28:31.442
go back and find her.

28:32.579 --> 28:36.337
That's what I'm gonna do
right after this job.

28:36.408 --> 28:38.444
How you know
she'll still be there?

28:39.343 --> 28:40.968
I just know.

28:41.046 --> 28:42.402
Personally, I refuse
to be tied down

28:42.426 --> 28:44.588
by anyone,
though many have tried.

28:44.628 --> 28:47.459
Come on, Rio.
You don't fool me.

28:47.598 --> 28:49.312
Everybody needs somebody.

28:50.290 --> 28:53.827
Even a broken down
old crook like this one.

29:04.690 --> 29:06.771
How about you? What are you
gonna do with your share?

29:19.514 --> 29:20.790
What was he saying?

29:20.830 --> 29:22.235
He said the Wookiees
were enslaved

29:22.275 --> 29:24.808
by the Empire,
taken off Kashyyyk.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.823
He's searching
for his, uh...

29:28.136 --> 29:30.271
I don't know if he said
tribe or family.

29:31.611 --> 29:32.920
What's the difference?

29:36.049 --> 29:37.545
Show me how to do that.

29:37.726 --> 29:39.955
The only thing
you need to learn to do

29:42.505 --> 29:45.278
is do what I say
when I say it.

29:45.535 --> 29:47.365
And this time tomorrow,

29:47.405 --> 29:48.639
you'll have
more than enough

29:48.679 --> 29:50.082
to buy your own ship.

30:11.812 --> 30:13.336
<i>Starting the clock.</i>

30:13.376 --> 30:16.078
Jamming their signal.
9.6 to the bridge.

30:16.118 --> 30:18.521
<i>Let's find out how good
we really are, folks.</i>

30:30.209 --> 30:31.209
I'm fine!

30:35.426 --> 30:37.110
Val, how's it going
up there?

30:41.285 --> 30:42.420
Never better.

31:05.586 --> 31:06.989
Coaxium.

31:07.372 --> 31:09.315
Enough to power a fleet!

31:09.355 --> 31:11.861
Or blow us all
straight to hell!

31:14.490 --> 31:15.824
<i>All right, talk to me.</i>

31:16.045 --> 31:17.274
Is it a good day?

31:17.485 --> 31:19.079
<i>It's a great day!</i>

31:19.119 --> 31:21.683
Best day of your life,
my grabby friend!

31:21.753 --> 31:22.896
I don't know,
you've never been

31:22.920 --> 31:24.710
to a Mynock roast
on Ardennia.

31:24.750 --> 31:25.851
It's nuts!

31:28.476 --> 31:29.670
Here they come!

31:29.765 --> 31:31.460
Get down to the couplers!

31:31.508 --> 31:33.061
Rio, fall back!

31:33.101 --> 31:34.438
Well, that didn't
take 'em long.

31:52.752 --> 31:53.752
Chewie!

32:10.059 --> 32:11.822
You all right?

32:11.862 --> 32:13.664
Little close there,
buddy!

32:18.085 --> 32:19.796
Han, what's the holdup?

32:20.640 --> 32:21.916
All right, together.

32:24.410 --> 32:25.737
Now!

32:30.760 --> 32:32.730
All right!

32:33.523 --> 32:34.524
Oh!

32:38.632 --> 32:41.072
They got one uncoupled.
Where are you, buddy?

32:41.145 --> 32:42.978
<i>Just up here
planning my retirement.</i>

32:42.980 --> 32:44.266
Thinking about opening
a cantina

32:44.268 --> 32:46.640
somewhere warm
but not too warm, you know?

32:46.714 --> 32:49.050
Lowering
the winch cables now!

33:05.785 --> 33:07.849
I knew it! I told him!
Beckett!

33:07.923 --> 33:09.091
<i>He's coming!</i>

33:10.605 --> 33:13.134
Damn it! I'm never gonna
hear the end of this!

33:17.884 --> 33:19.111
Who's that?

33:19.244 --> 33:20.707
Enfys Nest!

33:20.709 --> 33:22.501
Marauders, pirates.

33:22.503 --> 33:24.333
Come to snake the score
from under us.

33:25.362 --> 33:27.096
<i>Ready your harpoons.</i>

33:27.098 --> 33:28.099
<i>Move in.</i>

34:08.612 --> 34:11.007
Hang on!
I got an uninvited guest.

34:11.094 --> 34:14.452
Get off of my ship!

34:18.639 --> 34:20.521
You still with us, brother?

34:20.577 --> 34:22.478
Yeah, I'm okay.

34:22.536 --> 34:24.540
Just nicked one of my shoulders.
It's nothing.

34:25.120 --> 34:26.313
He's not okay.

34:33.554 --> 34:34.937
Chewie!

34:35.029 --> 34:37.306
You gotta uncouple this one
on your own!

34:42.754 --> 34:44.081
Han!

34:44.230 --> 34:45.398
I'm on it!

34:55.530 --> 34:56.103
Val!

34:56.106 --> 34:59.096
<i>Keep your eyes open.
We just tripped a sensor.</i>

35:04.578 --> 35:06.145
Viper droids
headed your way!

35:07.287 --> 35:09.316
Rio?

35:09.512 --> 35:11.531
Yeah, it looks worse
than it is.

35:12.088 --> 35:14.284
Just gotta patch it up.

35:14.324 --> 35:16.694
Maybe rest my eyes
for a minute.

35:36.893 --> 35:38.870
<i>Enough!
I'm going in.</i>

36:04.245 --> 36:05.580
You weren't lying, kid.

36:06.922 --> 36:08.617
You're a hell of a pilot.

36:08.658 --> 36:10.014
Rio, stay with me, buddy.

36:23.012 --> 36:24.959
Beckett,
we just lost a cable!

36:26.075 --> 36:27.945
<i>2.1 to the bridge!</i>

36:32.019 --> 36:33.686
It's no good
to die alone, kid.

36:35.429 --> 36:36.692
Val was right.

36:39.329 --> 36:40.457
Rio?

37:11.273 --> 37:12.962
Beckett, we're .8
from the bridge!

37:13.002 --> 37:15.165
<i>Val's still on the track!</i>

37:15.205 --> 37:17.404
Val, you gotta
get off that bridge!

37:17.406 --> 37:18.406
We're here!

37:22.823 --> 37:24.510
They got me pinned!

37:24.580 --> 37:26.731
I'm gonna have to finish
the job from right here.

37:26.887 --> 37:28.374
What?

37:28.451 --> 37:30.054
It's been a ride, babe.

37:31.658 --> 37:33.627
And I wouldn't trade it
for anything.

37:34.433 --> 37:35.353
<i>Val!</i>

37:35.423 --> 37:36.624
No!

37:42.071 --> 37:44.506
No!

37:58.090 --> 37:59.966
Chewie, now!

38:22.291 --> 38:24.520
<i>Beckett, I can't
pull it away from 'em.</i>

38:25.257 --> 38:27.658
They'll let go,
you fly straight!

38:29.933 --> 38:31.526
<i>Release your cables</i>

38:31.701 --> 38:33.003
<i>or die!</i>

38:34.275 --> 38:34.990
We're too close.

38:34.992 --> 38:36.120
I gotta release.

38:36.122 --> 38:37.596
You do what
I tell you, Han!

38:37.598 --> 38:39.050
Chewie, grab the line!

38:39.140 --> 38:40.482
Don't you do it!

38:43.778 --> 38:44.975
Han!

38:45.015 --> 38:46.581
<i>You coward!</i>

39:35.209 --> 39:36.694
What the hell?

39:36.985 --> 39:40.427
You don't listen
and you can't follow orders!

39:40.553 --> 39:42.895
You have any idea
what you've done?

39:43.013 --> 39:45.800
We were not stealing
for ourselves,

39:45.802 --> 39:48.417
we were hired
by Crimson Dawn.

39:50.778 --> 39:53.041
Crimson Dawn?

39:53.043 --> 39:55.401
Now we owe them 100 keys
of refined coaxium.

39:55.403 --> 39:57.599
When they find out
we don't got it,

39:57.902 --> 39:59.670
they're gonna kill us.

40:00.737 --> 40:02.366
Right.

40:02.610 --> 40:03.791
We run.

40:03.838 --> 40:06.701
I'm already a deserter.
What's the difference?

40:07.014 --> 40:08.041
The difference

40:08.043 --> 40:09.701
is the Empire
doesn't send out

40:09.703 --> 40:12.036
a team of enforcers
to hunt you down

40:12.120 --> 40:13.559
when you're a deserter.

40:13.638 --> 40:15.073
Dryden Vos will.

40:17.149 --> 40:18.169
You have any idea
what it's like

40:18.171 --> 40:20.108
to live with a price
on your head?

40:21.688 --> 40:24.358
The only thing to do
is to go to them.

40:24.445 --> 40:26.816
Maybe I can find some way
to make it up to him.

40:31.381 --> 40:32.816
Then that's what we do.

40:37.623 --> 40:38.824
No.

40:42.989 --> 40:45.327
He knows me,
not you.

40:46.337 --> 40:48.672
If you come with me

40:49.322 --> 40:51.617
and show your face,

40:51.619 --> 40:53.454
if they don't kill you,

40:55.008 --> 40:57.111
you're in this life for good.

40:59.368 --> 41:02.204
You find some way
to square this,

41:04.149 --> 41:05.983
we still get our money?

41:07.792 --> 41:09.193
Maybe.

41:11.677 --> 41:14.012
For me,
it's worth the risk.

41:16.675 --> 41:17.676
How about you?

41:24.851 --> 41:26.520
That's yes.

41:28.400 --> 41:31.631
Sorry I punched your face.

41:31.850 --> 41:34.020
Happens more often
than you think.

41:36.154 --> 41:37.041
So when we get up there,

41:37.043 --> 41:39.321
Dryden Vos is waiting for us
at Fort Ypso?

41:39.401 --> 41:42.480
Nearby,
on his yacht.

41:42.546 --> 41:44.541
You're gonna know
how to find it?

41:44.620 --> 41:46.190
That won't be
a problem.

42:27.548 --> 42:30.151
I'll need to
check your weapons.

42:31.520 --> 42:32.999
That's all I got left.

43:13.517 --> 43:16.410
I'm here to see Dryden.
He's expecting me.

43:16.517 --> 43:17.840
He'll be with you
shortly.

43:17.842 --> 43:20.004
He's just finishing
with the regional governor.

43:25.260 --> 43:26.525
Excuse me, sir.

43:26.527 --> 43:27.588
Yes.

43:27.677 --> 43:30.565
- Beckett has arrived.
- Oh.

43:32.689 --> 43:36.267
Put this in my office.
I might be needing it later.

43:42.725 --> 43:45.255
I get all worked up.
Silly.

43:45.530 --> 43:46.830
It's a party.

43:50.288 --> 43:51.459
Hey.

43:51.461 --> 43:54.620
These people are
not your friends

43:54.746 --> 43:57.376
and they're never gonna be,
so don't talk to any of 'em.

43:57.449 --> 43:58.579
Don't look at anybody,

43:58.581 --> 44:00.408
just keep your eyes down.

44:04.204 --> 44:05.757
I might get a drink.

44:18.547 --> 44:20.021
No, yeah, whatever.

44:38.382 --> 44:40.852
Chewie, would you please...

44:49.968 --> 44:51.730
Qi'ra, what are you
doing here?

44:51.732 --> 44:53.094
I work here.

44:53.369 --> 44:55.131
What's your excuse?

44:55.133 --> 44:56.463
My... I...

44:56.465 --> 44:58.135
Qi'ra, I was...

45:00.742 --> 45:02.845
I was coming back
for you.

45:03.526 --> 45:05.369
It's in the past, Han.

45:05.457 --> 45:05.997
Not for me.

45:06.037 --> 45:06.963
The only reason I'm here,

45:06.965 --> 45:08.567
I was doing this job,
get a little money

45:08.619 --> 45:11.309
and then I was gonna come back
to Corellia and find you.

45:11.386 --> 45:13.454
Well, now you don't have to.

45:14.486 --> 45:16.455
I'm right in front of you.

45:18.673 --> 45:19.964
That day...

45:20.019 --> 45:21.715
Sometimes,
a lot of times, I think...

45:21.717 --> 45:23.018
If you'd have stayed,

45:24.231 --> 45:26.301
they would've killed you.

45:27.726 --> 45:29.728
I'm glad you got out.

45:34.070 --> 45:35.470
How did you get out?

45:39.235 --> 45:41.104
I didn't.

45:44.306 --> 45:46.061
You look good.

45:46.083 --> 45:47.844
A little rough
around the edges,

45:47.941 --> 45:49.243
but good.

45:49.787 --> 45:50.889
You too.

45:51.627 --> 45:52.826
Thank you, Ottilie.

45:53.661 --> 45:55.458
Have you been attentive
to Dok-Ondar?

45:55.460 --> 45:56.528
Very.

45:59.977 --> 46:02.007
What should we drink to?

46:02.384 --> 46:05.254
Let's drink two
and see where it goes.

46:13.268 --> 46:15.952
Did you ever get that ship
we were going to fly away on?

46:15.975 --> 46:18.139
Yeah.
Sort of.

46:18.208 --> 46:20.490
About to.
That's why I'm here.

46:20.549 --> 46:22.868
I'm working on a...

46:22.870 --> 46:24.827
Very big deal.

46:24.854 --> 46:25.982
How big?

46:26.171 --> 46:27.182
Enormous.

46:27.237 --> 46:30.768
Really? And when are you going
to close this enormous deal?

46:30.883 --> 46:32.451
Any minute.

46:33.836 --> 46:36.134
I thought
about you a lot.

46:36.195 --> 46:39.411
Off somewhere,
some adventure.

46:39.505 --> 46:42.543
I imagined myself with you.
It always made me...

46:45.544 --> 46:47.274
- What?
- Hey.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.398
What did I say?

46:49.452 --> 46:51.491
Look, I can't keep my eyes
down the whole time.

46:51.571 --> 46:52.968
I'm gonna
bump into something.

46:53.010 --> 46:54.350
But I told you
not to talk to anyone.

46:54.374 --> 46:55.375
Beckett.

46:56.262 --> 46:59.133
Wait.
You two work together?

47:00.238 --> 47:01.507
- Yeah.
- Tobias!

47:03.420 --> 47:05.148
Dryden.

47:05.195 --> 47:07.204
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?

47:07.206 --> 47:09.075
No, I'm fine.

47:10.099 --> 47:11.795
I'm sorry
to hear about Val.

47:11.890 --> 47:13.250
Yeah,
I appreciate that.

47:13.327 --> 47:14.594
But there was no way
we could've anticipated...

47:14.596 --> 47:17.158
I don't believe
we've been introduced.

47:17.160 --> 47:20.208
Yeah. This is Han Solo
and Chewbacca.

47:20.210 --> 47:21.804
They're with me.

47:21.807 --> 47:23.535
I'm Dryden Vos.

47:23.817 --> 47:27.400
I see you've already met
my top lieutenant.

47:29.836 --> 47:32.016
Han and I grew up
together on Corellia.

47:32.701 --> 47:35.110
Oh, fellow scrumrat.

47:35.208 --> 47:38.539
I admire anyone who can crawl
their way out of the sewer.

47:38.672 --> 47:41.456
Especially,
a sewer as putrid as Corellia.

47:41.526 --> 47:43.520
The stench, am I right?

47:44.660 --> 47:46.160
Well, it's good
to have you.

47:46.335 --> 47:48.071
Welcome.

47:48.119 --> 47:50.452
And you, too, Chewbacca,
welcome.

47:51.116 --> 47:55.153
All right, let's eat a
little, drink a lot,

47:55.155 --> 47:56.498
and talk privately.

47:59.694 --> 48:01.103
We're just friends,
all right?

48:01.105 --> 48:03.032
You're touchy.

48:03.921 --> 48:07.593
Beckett, you have
put me in a terrible position.

48:07.644 --> 48:09.725
I know, Dryden,
and I am sorry.

48:09.784 --> 48:10.709
You're sorry?

48:10.747 --> 48:12.210
Dryden, there were
complications.

48:12.212 --> 48:13.000
There were factors.

48:13.002 --> 48:16.423
Enfys Nest has been
a constant irritation forever.

48:16.425 --> 48:18.032
It's one you should've
anticipated,

48:18.034 --> 48:19.595
it's one you should've
dealt with.

48:19.597 --> 48:21.083
Trust me, I know
I made a mistake,

48:21.152 --> 48:24.076
but when you hired me,
you told me

48:24.078 --> 48:25.076
no one else
had this information...

48:25.078 --> 48:26.467
Test me!

48:27.539 --> 48:30.436
Test me one more time,
you'll see what happens.

48:30.508 --> 48:32.895
I think what Dryden
is trying to say

48:32.897 --> 48:35.828
is that we're not interested
in why you don't have it.

48:36.036 --> 48:37.890
No, I'm not interested.

48:37.892 --> 48:39.701
I'm not interested
at all.

48:39.889 --> 48:40.963
Dryden,

48:40.965 --> 48:42.938
what can I do
to make this right?

48:43.019 --> 48:44.847
"Make this right?"

48:45.120 --> 48:47.316
There is no
making this right.

48:47.559 --> 48:48.846
You know who I answer to

48:48.848 --> 48:51.201
and you know
what he'll expect of me.

48:51.203 --> 48:53.340
He'll say, "There have
to be consequences."

48:53.342 --> 48:57.067
So here's what I need you
to do for me.

48:57.195 --> 49:00.730
I need you to give me
a reason

49:01.192 --> 49:03.837
not to kill you all.

49:03.886 --> 49:05.796
Because I will
make it up to you.

49:05.798 --> 49:07.076
No, no, no. How?

49:07.078 --> 49:08.363
How will you
make it up to me?

49:08.365 --> 49:11.764
By delivering exactly
what was promised.

49:12.577 --> 49:15.431
100 k-grams of
refined coaxium?

49:15.433 --> 49:18.869
Yes. We will simply steal it
from somewhere else.

49:18.871 --> 49:20.301
From where?

49:20.382 --> 49:21.510
You'll be hard pushed
to find that

49:21.512 --> 49:23.187
anywhere outside
an Imperial vault.

49:23.189 --> 49:25.184
Scarif.
Maybe Mercy Island.

49:25.186 --> 49:26.520
That's impossible.

49:26.522 --> 49:29.219
So, let's come up
with some other options.

49:29.286 --> 49:30.581
Other ideas
that we might...

49:30.583 --> 49:32.486
What about unrefined?

49:35.641 --> 49:38.694
Well, the only known
source of astatic coaxium

49:38.741 --> 49:41.690
is a fissure vent beneath
the spice mines on Kessel.

49:41.692 --> 49:43.925
Yeah. That's the one
I was thinking of.

49:43.927 --> 49:45.558
That's a very,
very good one.

49:45.637 --> 49:47.850
But see,
the Pykes control Kessel.

49:47.903 --> 49:48.926
Crimson Dawn maintains

49:48.968 --> 49:51.263
a fragile alliance
with the Pykes.

49:51.352 --> 49:53.628
It's one that
I can't jeopardize

49:53.630 --> 49:55.759
without risking an all-out
war with the Syndicates,

49:55.761 --> 49:58.939
and that, gentlemen,
I will not do.

49:59.129 --> 50:02.735
So, if that's all you have,
I think we're done here.

50:02.737 --> 50:03.598
Not all we have.

50:03.600 --> 50:06.630
We don't have any alliance
with the Pykes.

50:06.632 --> 50:09.101
Right, so nobody is gonna know
we're working for you.

50:19.089 --> 50:20.090
Possible?

50:20.554 --> 50:21.817
It's risky.

50:21.819 --> 50:24.517
As soon as the raw coaxium
is removed from the vault,

50:24.519 --> 50:26.173
it starts to destabilize,

50:26.175 --> 50:27.808
so unless...

50:27.810 --> 50:29.339
Unless...

50:29.669 --> 50:30.937
Unless...

50:31.563 --> 50:32.691
Work with me here.

50:32.693 --> 50:34.481
Unless you could
find somewhere

50:34.483 --> 50:36.183
to get it processed fast.

50:36.185 --> 50:37.467
- Uh...
- Uh...

50:38.375 --> 50:39.676
Well...

50:40.666 --> 50:42.029
He's saying Savareen?

50:42.249 --> 50:43.380
Savareen.

50:43.382 --> 50:45.288
Yeah,
it's an old refinery there

50:45.290 --> 50:47.472
and it's not under
Imperial jurisdiction.

50:47.558 --> 50:49.215
But Qi'ra's right.

50:49.277 --> 50:52.708
The canisters will explode
before you get there,

50:52.710 --> 50:55.091
so you'd need
an incredibly fast ship

50:55.146 --> 50:56.800
and a brilliant pilot.

50:56.914 --> 50:58.448
We'll find a ship.

50:58.450 --> 51:00.160
We've already
got the pilot.

51:04.847 --> 51:08.611
He is arrogant
and he's hungry.

51:08.641 --> 51:09.597
So what do you think,
my dear?

51:09.599 --> 51:14.399
You think your friend here
can do what needs to be done?

51:20.922 --> 51:22.891
Yes, I believe he can.

51:24.506 --> 51:25.794
Well, that is good news,

51:25.796 --> 51:27.792
because you're going with him

51:28.087 --> 51:30.359
to see that he does.

51:31.709 --> 51:33.577
All right?

51:34.803 --> 51:35.804
Of course.

51:37.421 --> 51:38.984
All right.

51:39.035 --> 51:40.696
I'll see you all
on Savareen.

51:40.804 --> 51:41.824
Savareen it is.

51:41.878 --> 51:43.667
- I feel great about this plan.
- Me, too.

51:43.669 --> 51:45.395
We should do this again.
It's been fun.

51:45.927 --> 51:46.444
Great.

51:46.446 --> 51:48.108
Oh, just one more thing.

51:48.681 --> 51:50.448
If you do fail me again,

51:52.089 --> 51:53.635
we'll all be out of options.

51:54.238 --> 51:55.309
Right?

51:55.311 --> 51:56.379
We won't.

51:59.414 --> 52:02.230
So, I thought
that went really well.

52:02.282 --> 52:04.523
Let's get this done as quick
and as clean as possible.

52:04.525 --> 52:05.411
What do you need?

52:05.413 --> 52:07.170
I can scrounge up
the gear.

52:07.172 --> 52:08.686
Do you got a line
on a ship?

52:08.890 --> 52:09.925
I know a guy.

52:11.182 --> 52:13.645
And I know
just where to find him.

52:13.647 --> 52:15.706
It's a long shot,
but it's worth a try.

52:15.810 --> 52:17.075
He's the best
smuggler around.

52:17.077 --> 52:18.229
He's slipped through
the Empire's fingers

52:18.231 --> 52:20.362
more times than anyone else.

52:20.832 --> 52:23.176
He's attractive, too.

52:23.178 --> 52:24.140
Sophisticated,

52:24.142 --> 52:27.947
with impeccable taste
and... Charisma.

52:29.779 --> 52:32.045
Not to mention
his prodigious...

52:32.125 --> 52:33.127
We get it.

52:37.740 --> 52:40.895
But he's retired.
Says he's a sportsman now.

52:40.897 --> 52:42.658
All we need is his ship.

52:42.773 --> 52:44.484
Well, he'll never
part with it.

52:44.486 --> 52:45.667
He loves that ship.

52:45.669 --> 52:47.136
He won it

52:47.869 --> 52:48.814
playing Sabacc.

52:48.816 --> 52:50.094
And there's the rub, right?

52:50.096 --> 52:52.208
How was I supposed to know
she was an Imperial spy?

52:52.210 --> 52:54.406
I thought she loved me.

52:54.501 --> 52:55.939
That's the guy, huh?

52:55.941 --> 52:57.302
Hmm.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.498
An interesting style.

52:59.773 --> 53:00.775
I'll say.

53:01.564 --> 53:02.697
You say he won his ship?

53:02.699 --> 53:04.815
You have an awful Sabacc face.
I'm gonna call it.

53:04.817 --> 53:06.454
I can take him.
Let me at him.

53:06.456 --> 53:07.918
Absolutely not.

53:07.920 --> 53:09.982
Han, these guys
are serious gamblers.

53:10.043 --> 53:12.139
I'm serious. Stake me.

53:12.141 --> 53:14.547
Don't listen to him.

53:20.930 --> 53:23.007
Thank you. Thank you.

53:23.009 --> 53:24.779
You see, how'd you guys
let me beat you on that one?

53:24.781 --> 53:25.782
Come on.

53:27.101 --> 53:29.217
There's no liars in this game,
just players.

53:29.340 --> 53:30.810
Is this seat taken?

53:33.795 --> 53:36.237
If nobody's in the seat,
then it ain't taken, friend.

53:39.303 --> 53:41.800
So this is, uh, Sabacc?

53:42.120 --> 53:42.954
Sabacc.

53:42.956 --> 53:45.587
Sabacc. Got it.

53:45.641 --> 53:46.835
You play it before?

53:47.116 --> 53:48.609
A couple times, yeah.

53:50.122 --> 53:51.579
Captain Lando Calrissian.

53:51.612 --> 53:53.430
Han Solo.

53:53.432 --> 53:55.361
Looks like you're
having a good day.

53:55.586 --> 53:56.641
I'm a lucky guy.

53:57.751 --> 54:00.431
Can I ask you a question,
Captain Calrissian?

54:00.643 --> 54:01.987
Anything, Han.

54:02.275 --> 54:05.658
That's "Han",
but that's okay.

54:05.660 --> 54:09.296
I heard a story about you.
I was wondering if it's true.

54:10.453 --> 54:14.053
Everything you've heard
about me is true.

54:14.200 --> 54:15.180
Thanks, love.

54:15.182 --> 54:17.511
Did you win your ship
playing cards?

54:17.513 --> 54:19.098
Oh, I've won a lot of things.

54:20.691 --> 54:23.755
I once won a subtropical moon
in the Oseon Belt.

54:24.132 --> 54:24.960
Wow.

54:24.962 --> 54:27.088
Turned out to be
a real money pit.

54:27.166 --> 54:27.819
I'm impressed.

54:27.859 --> 54:29.120
I don't think I'd have
the nerve to gamble

54:29.122 --> 54:31.417
with something
I love as much as my ship.

54:31.461 --> 54:33.024
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:33.454 --> 54:34.489
What do you fly?

54:35.195 --> 54:36.997
VCX-100.

54:38.519 --> 54:40.424
That is a quality ship.
Right, boys?

54:40.518 --> 54:42.281
It's the fastest
in the galaxy,

54:42.283 --> 54:43.712
but there's a lot of
great ships out there.

54:43.714 --> 54:46.118
I mean, I'm sure
yours is very nice.

54:46.272 --> 54:48.141
Gets me where I'm goin'.

54:52.535 --> 54:53.770
Beginner's luck.

54:53.861 --> 54:55.663
Well played.

55:02.796 --> 55:04.792
Let's see what
we got here.

55:04.794 --> 55:06.586
Oh, great hand!

55:10.284 --> 55:13.282
Sorry, guys.
Close, but not quite.

55:22.897 --> 55:25.067
Eyes on
your own cards, buddy.

55:25.626 --> 55:27.234
All of 'em.

55:27.236 --> 55:29.160
There.
Well, now I see yours.

55:34.362 --> 55:38.601
Oh, that's me?
Okay, let's see...

55:41.169 --> 55:43.132
Sorry, minus two.

55:47.849 --> 55:49.754
This game is fun.

55:49.823 --> 55:51.769
All right,
how about this?

55:51.799 --> 55:54.434
I'll see your bet
and I'll raise you.

55:55.898 --> 55:58.035
2,000.

56:01.772 --> 56:03.345
I'll see your 2,000

56:03.741 --> 56:05.871
and I'll raise you

56:06.389 --> 56:08.009
however much this is.

56:10.817 --> 56:12.469
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Han.

56:12.531 --> 56:14.060
Slow down.

56:14.187 --> 56:15.770
You might wanna quit
while you're ahead.

56:15.844 --> 56:17.846
You might wanna quit
while you're behind.

56:19.892 --> 56:21.620
I like this kid.

56:21.692 --> 56:22.788
You're adorable.

56:22.828 --> 56:24.190
And I'm serious.

56:24.520 --> 56:25.621
And I'm calling.

56:26.269 --> 56:27.696
With what?

56:27.736 --> 56:28.736
Your scarf?

56:28.889 --> 56:29.967
Not my style.

56:30.007 --> 56:31.175
My ship.

56:32.494 --> 56:33.923
Against your ship.

56:35.872 --> 56:37.706
Time to find out
if you got the nerve.

56:40.763 --> 56:42.032
What the hell?

56:46.048 --> 56:47.313
Straight Staves.

56:57.018 --> 56:59.514
You played me.
You're good.

56:59.577 --> 57:01.187
- Yeah.
- You're very good.

57:01.783 --> 57:03.545
But not good enough.

57:03.780 --> 57:04.780
Full Sabacc.

57:11.396 --> 57:13.073
I told you to quit
while you were ahead.

57:15.161 --> 57:17.164
Drinks on me!

57:21.369 --> 57:22.770
Yeah, that's right.

57:29.953 --> 57:31.274
First of all,
there's no way

57:31.276 --> 57:32.855
he could've had
that green sylop.

57:32.857 --> 57:33.861
They'd all been played.

57:33.863 --> 57:35.592
Also, your guy,
Captain Wonderful,

57:35.597 --> 57:37.038
is so full of bantha crap...

57:37.040 --> 57:38.775
Yoo-hoo!

57:40.792 --> 57:42.627
Where's my VCX?

57:43.038 --> 57:44.652
I don't have it
right here now.

57:44.654 --> 57:46.107
It's in the shop.

57:46.109 --> 57:48.229
- I'm getting some work done.
- Lando.

57:49.724 --> 57:51.154
Qi'ra.

57:52.273 --> 57:55.370
You look phenomenal.
As always.

57:55.503 --> 57:57.372
Well, I knew I was
gonna see you.

57:58.081 --> 57:58.983
Get off!

57:58.985 --> 58:00.412
What are you doing
with hairy and the boy?

58:00.414 --> 58:02.878
- There's no need, none.
- They work for me.

58:02.977 --> 58:04.144
Good help
is hard to find, no?

58:04.146 --> 58:05.482
We're more like partners.

58:06.961 --> 58:08.086
We are.

58:08.313 --> 58:09.314
Excuse us.

58:10.228 --> 58:11.562
Listen, last I checked,

58:11.564 --> 58:13.262
me and Crimson Dawn,
we're squared away.

58:13.368 --> 58:15.029
Dryden said
all is forgiven

58:15.031 --> 58:17.238
after I did the whole
Felucia thing for him.

58:17.240 --> 58:20.044
Yeah. New move,
we're making the Kessel Run.

58:21.763 --> 58:23.025
We need a ship.

58:23.027 --> 58:24.354
Why didn't you
just say so?

58:24.356 --> 58:25.599
I thought
you were retired.

58:27.026 --> 58:28.960
Circumstances change.

58:29.418 --> 58:30.946
How much?

58:30.987 --> 58:32.439
The Kessel Run.

58:32.507 --> 58:35.278
That's no easy spin.
I'm gonna need half the take.

58:35.391 --> 58:36.729
Ridiculous.

58:36.731 --> 58:38.904
Grown-ups are talking.

58:39.136 --> 58:40.371
25%.

58:45.638 --> 58:46.906
You're Tobias Beckett.

58:47.696 --> 58:49.171
You killed Aurra Sing.

58:50.287 --> 58:52.799
Pushed her. Pretty sure
the fall killed her.

58:52.801 --> 58:55.764
You did the galaxy a favor
that day. Me, especially.

58:55.766 --> 58:56.794
I owed her
a lot of money.

58:56.796 --> 58:58.892
And as token
of my gratitude,

58:59.258 --> 59:01.544
I'm willing
to do this for 40%.

59:04.784 --> 59:06.254
25.

59:11.406 --> 59:13.369
25% works.

59:13.472 --> 59:15.880
No! Unacceptable!

59:16.038 --> 59:18.010
Stop exploiting droids!

59:18.081 --> 59:20.233
You sloppy degenerate bios!

59:20.346 --> 59:21.924
- She never learns.
- Have you no shame?

59:21.948 --> 59:22.985
Who?

59:23.037 --> 59:23.702
My first mate.

59:23.704 --> 59:26.248
You got no business
being here. Get out of here!

59:26.288 --> 59:29.166
How can you condone
this savagery?

59:29.264 --> 59:31.960
You, you. You should
not be doing this.

59:31.962 --> 59:34.601
They're using you
for entertainment.

59:34.603 --> 59:36.467
Yeah. You've
been neurowashed.

59:36.498 --> 59:38.692
Don't just blindly
follow the program.

59:38.694 --> 59:40.714
Exercise some free will!

59:41.886 --> 59:43.383
Stay away from him!

59:43.509 --> 59:44.822
He's never
had it so good.

59:44.888 --> 59:47.890
Oh, really? How about you have
a go at me, ya lumpy brute.

59:47.922 --> 59:48.982
Bring it on!
Come on!

59:49.020 --> 59:49.904
L3!

59:49.906 --> 59:52.165
Droid rights!
We are sentient!

59:52.221 --> 59:54.224
I'm gonna flip your switch.

59:55.165 --> 59:56.344
Good luck finding it.

59:56.346 --> 59:57.580
L3!

59:59.427 --> 01:00:01.357
Let go
of the mean man's face.

01:00:01.425 --> 01:00:02.230
We're leaving.

01:00:02.276 --> 01:00:04.537
They don't even
serve our kind here.

01:00:04.678 --> 01:00:05.678
Now.

01:00:09.304 --> 01:00:10.966
Who are these guys?

01:00:10.968 --> 01:00:12.328
We're taking them
to Kessel.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.953
Oh, are we?

01:00:14.625 --> 01:00:16.892
And what if I don't elect
to go to Kessel?

01:00:16.999 --> 01:00:18.199
Please don't start.

01:00:18.245 --> 01:00:19.858
Or what,
you'll have me wiped?

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.197
You couldn't get from here
to Black Spire without me.

01:00:22.253 --> 01:00:23.710
Now you're gonna
make the Kessel Run?

01:00:23.764 --> 01:00:25.827
If she doesn't wanna fly,
I'll be your co-pilot.

01:00:25.867 --> 01:00:27.596
- I don't mind.
- No, no. It's okay.

01:00:27.941 --> 01:00:29.168
She's definitely going.

01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:32.401
Oh, why? Because
you're my organic overlord?

01:00:32.403 --> 01:00:34.366
Because I'm your
captain, how about that?

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:36.910
I actually would have
her memory wiped,

01:00:36.912 --> 01:00:37.730
but she's got
the best damn

01:00:37.732 --> 01:00:39.861
navigational database
in the galaxy.

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.001
Could use a fresh coat
of paint, though!

01:00:42.054 --> 01:00:46.485
Landonis, you do not want to
press that button with me.

01:00:46.677 --> 01:00:49.241
You know, a lot of
ships around here get boosted.

01:00:49.453 --> 01:00:51.696
So, I keep mine locked up.

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:53.411
You know, for safety.

01:00:54.062 --> 01:00:56.265
L3, do you mind?

01:01:02.328 --> 01:01:03.844
Look away.

01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:05.717
I can't perform
with you looking at me.

01:01:05.903 --> 01:01:06.903
Please indulge her.

01:01:14.987 --> 01:01:17.024
I can feel you
looking at me.

01:01:22.158 --> 01:01:23.763
What are we
doing here?

01:01:23.765 --> 01:01:24.999
This guy's a hustler.

01:01:25.001 --> 01:01:26.436
I don't even think
he's got a ship.

01:01:26.438 --> 01:01:28.066
If he does, it's gonna
be a piece of junk

01:01:28.153 --> 01:01:29.060
if it's even here.

01:01:29.062 --> 01:01:31.665
There she is,
my pride and joy.

01:01:32.679 --> 01:01:34.142
The <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

01:01:49.695 --> 01:01:51.750
Looks like you had
a little work done.

01:01:51.814 --> 01:01:53.381
Indeed I have, Han.

01:01:53.446 --> 01:01:55.878
Installed an escape pod
in the mandible notch,

01:01:55.941 --> 01:01:58.552
alluvial dampers, a wet bar.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:00.206
And a fortified infraction

01:02:00.208 --> 01:02:02.472
restraint on the landing gear.

01:02:02.887 --> 01:02:05.624
Looks to me like they
impounded your ship, Lando.

01:02:06.675 --> 01:02:08.204
This is unbelievable!

01:02:08.565 --> 01:02:09.752
I'm definitely
gonna have some words

01:02:09.754 --> 01:02:11.878
with someone about this.

01:02:13.615 --> 01:02:15.784
You must have experience
with these, right?

01:02:15.799 --> 01:02:17.293
Yeah, I could
take it off.

01:02:17.364 --> 01:02:18.520
Fantastic!

01:02:18.523 --> 01:02:20.489
Along with five percent
off your cut.

01:02:21.314 --> 01:02:23.201
You're down to 20.

01:02:25.836 --> 01:02:27.699
I don't like it.

01:02:27.701 --> 01:02:29.136
I don't agree with it.

01:02:30.262 --> 01:02:31.464
But I accept it.

01:02:32.959 --> 01:02:34.610
You're getting
the hang of this, Lando.

01:02:35.321 --> 01:02:36.741
Yeah.

01:02:36.743 --> 01:02:37.941
Come on, Chewie.

01:02:37.943 --> 01:02:40.149
Gonna need a little bit of
that Wookiee oomph.

01:02:42.229 --> 01:02:44.082
<i>Your plan
is underway, Enfys.</i>

01:02:44.142 --> 01:02:45.724
<i>We've attached
the homing beacon.</i>

01:02:45.726 --> 01:02:47.701
<i>They won't elude us now.</i>

01:02:47.776 --> 01:02:48.778
<i>Good.</i>

01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:57.400
<i>If they survive, they'll
bring the prize to us.</i>

01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:15.119
This is a Corellian YT-1300.

01:03:15.768 --> 01:03:17.670
Oh. You know your stuff.

01:03:18.243 --> 01:03:19.938
I've been on one before.

01:03:19.994 --> 01:03:20.999
My dad worked the line

01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:23.503
at the CEC plant
before he got laid off.

01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:25.858
He built these.

01:03:27.113 --> 01:03:29.409
He wanted
to be a pilot, but...

01:03:29.785 --> 01:03:31.788
You, uh,
close with your old man?

01:03:32.751 --> 01:03:33.913
Not really.

01:03:34.054 --> 01:03:36.085
Yeah, me neither.

01:03:36.329 --> 01:03:38.220
My mom,
on the other hand,

01:03:38.478 --> 01:03:40.430
most amazing woman
I've ever known.

01:03:43.675 --> 01:03:44.828
Excuse me.

01:03:44.868 --> 01:03:47.581
Get your presumptuous ass
out of my seat!

01:03:53.277 --> 01:03:56.241
My sacral-occipital
circuit is sticking.

01:03:56.524 --> 01:03:58.365
You're gonna have
to do that thing again later.

01:03:58.606 --> 01:04:00.214
Yeah.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.439
All right, course
to Kessel is set.

01:04:02.501 --> 01:04:04.118
Plugging coordinates
in now.

01:04:04.263 --> 01:04:05.683
Just keep your pinky
on the yoke

01:04:05.738 --> 01:04:06.937
and try not to mess
anything up.

01:04:06.961 --> 01:04:07.922
Whatever you say, my lady.

01:04:07.962 --> 01:04:09.642
Just let me know when
you're ready to jump.

01:04:09.812 --> 01:04:11.292
Ready in...

01:04:14.205 --> 01:04:15.206
Ready.

01:04:15.945 --> 01:04:18.461
It's just a simple jump to
hyperspace, and we're there.

01:04:18.463 --> 01:04:19.842
What's so tricky about that?

01:04:19.881 --> 01:04:22.253
Plenty. Can't plot
a direct course to Kessel.

01:04:22.308 --> 01:04:23.867
You have to thread through
the Si'Klaata Cluster

01:04:23.891 --> 01:04:26.354
and then pass through
The Maelstrom.

01:04:26.636 --> 01:04:28.305
You done flirting?
I'm still ready.

01:04:29.657 --> 01:04:31.359
You might wanna
buckle up, baby.

01:04:52.132 --> 01:04:53.211
Think.

01:04:53.313 --> 01:04:54.980
Do you wanna
make that move?

01:04:55.123 --> 01:04:57.423
Do you wanna make that move?

01:04:57.478 --> 01:04:59.338
You made that move, okay.

01:04:59.425 --> 01:05:02.189
I guess I have to
destroy that little guy.

01:05:02.229 --> 01:05:04.372
Somehow I never
get bored with winning.

01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:08.426
No, you can't wipe 'em off.
They're holograms.

01:05:09.451 --> 01:05:11.505
Hey, hey, hey!
Chewie, relax!

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:13.658
Hey, try to compose yourself.

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:16.039
Look. All you gotta do is
think a few moves ahead,

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.374
anticipate your opponent.

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:19.809
There's a lesson
to be learned here.

01:05:19.881 --> 01:05:21.117
Uh, you guys seen Qi'ra?

01:05:23.984 --> 01:05:25.791
People are predictable.

01:05:47.451 --> 01:05:49.713
Yeah, I had to
try one on.

01:05:49.847 --> 01:05:51.282
That's a lot of capes.

01:05:51.353 --> 01:05:53.362
Maybe too many capes.

01:05:57.763 --> 01:05:59.391
So what's the plan?

01:05:59.479 --> 01:06:00.994
Well, I thought
we'd talk a little first

01:06:00.996 --> 01:06:02.853
and then you know...

01:06:02.855 --> 01:06:04.859
- For Kessel.
- Oh.

01:06:04.952 --> 01:06:06.468
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good.

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:08.102
Yeah? How good?

01:06:08.484 --> 01:06:09.271
Foolproof.

01:06:09.311 --> 01:06:11.072
Well, it better be.

01:06:11.332 --> 01:06:12.141
- I...
- I...

01:06:12.241 --> 01:06:13.425
- You go first.
- No.

01:06:13.449 --> 01:06:15.077
What were you gonna say?

01:06:15.203 --> 01:06:18.063
I wanna tell you
so much.

01:06:18.548 --> 01:06:20.117
And I wanna know
everything

01:06:20.157 --> 01:06:21.872
that's happened to you
since Corellia.

01:06:23.293 --> 01:06:25.868
I'm not sure
we have that kinda time.

01:06:26.017 --> 01:06:27.125
We could.

01:06:27.165 --> 01:06:29.546
We could have all the time
we want after the job.

01:06:29.624 --> 01:06:30.704
You and I.

01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:32.370
What?

01:06:33.342 --> 01:06:34.677
I want to.

01:06:35.567 --> 01:06:36.736
You want to?

01:06:37.018 --> 01:06:38.888
To tell you everything
that's happened.

01:06:40.548 --> 01:06:42.811
But I know if I do,
you won't look at me the same.

01:06:43.119 --> 01:06:44.840
The way that you're
looking at me right now.

01:06:44.957 --> 01:06:46.302
Nothing is gonna
change the way

01:06:46.304 --> 01:06:47.152
I'm looking at you
right now.

01:06:47.154 --> 01:06:49.639
You don't know that.
You don't know what I've done.

01:07:03.454 --> 01:07:05.016
Am I interrupting something?

01:07:07.693 --> 01:07:08.693
Kinda.

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:10.184
Good.

01:07:10.194 --> 01:07:12.547
'Cause we got
a lot of work to do.

01:07:12.587 --> 01:07:14.134
You're making
a big mistake.

01:07:14.204 --> 01:07:15.263
- Oh, really?
- Which is yours to make

01:07:15.265 --> 01:07:17.486
except when you start to
interfere with my livelihood.

01:07:17.526 --> 01:07:18.570
This isn't gonna interfere
with your livelihood.

01:07:18.594 --> 01:07:19.555
Then we have a problem.

01:07:19.595 --> 01:07:22.052
You don't see it,
because you don't want to.

01:07:22.054 --> 01:07:23.815
Maybe I know her
a little better than you do.

01:07:24.092 --> 01:07:26.561
Maybe you don't know
her well enough.

01:07:27.428 --> 01:07:28.132
All right?

01:07:28.297 --> 01:07:29.700
Look.

01:07:30.372 --> 01:07:31.870
I like you, kid.

01:07:31.986 --> 01:07:34.458
We got a good thing going here.
Me, you, Chewie.

01:07:34.522 --> 01:07:35.409
- Yeah.
- Right?

01:07:35.411 --> 01:07:37.668
The makings
of a solid crew.

01:07:37.782 --> 01:07:39.843
But it does not work
with Qi'ra.

01:07:40.063 --> 01:07:42.298
It worked with Val.
You trusted her.

01:07:44.248 --> 01:07:47.003
You wanna know how I've
survived as long as I have?

01:07:47.899 --> 01:07:49.263
I trust no one.

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:53.157
Assume everyone
will betray you

01:07:53.159 --> 01:07:55.037
and you will never
be disappointed.

01:07:56.397 --> 01:07:58.365
Sounds like
a lonely way to live.

01:07:59.261 --> 01:08:00.897
It's the only way.

01:08:08.168 --> 01:08:09.641
Dropping out
of lightspeed now.

01:08:09.665 --> 01:08:10.665
Ready to...

01:08:16.106 --> 01:08:18.073
The Akkadese Maelstrom.

01:08:20.077 --> 01:08:21.671
I'm gonna go check
on the dampers.

01:08:21.712 --> 01:08:22.640
You need anything?

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.049
Equal rights?

01:08:54.328 --> 01:08:55.423
What's that sound?

01:08:55.759 --> 01:08:58.680
Carbonbergs, size of planets,
crashing into each other.

01:08:58.682 --> 01:09:01.207
Ships fly in there,
they never come out.

01:09:01.264 --> 01:09:03.259
It's ionized gas,
water vapor,

01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:05.040
possibly vacuum-breathing
life forms

01:09:05.131 --> 01:09:06.481
swirling around The Maw.

01:09:06.554 --> 01:09:08.466
Only way in or out
is this channel.

01:09:10.171 --> 01:09:12.407
So what are you gonna do
about your little problem?

01:09:12.808 --> 01:09:13.942
Problem?

01:09:14.136 --> 01:09:15.506
Uh...

01:09:15.988 --> 01:09:16.912
Well, that brand
on your wrist

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.008
tells me that
you're committed.

01:09:19.048 --> 01:09:20.944
And that young male's
heart fluctuations

01:09:20.984 --> 01:09:22.350
tell me
he's in love with you.

01:09:22.421 --> 01:09:25.015
Han is not in love with me!

01:09:26.161 --> 01:09:28.229
Oh, please. It's just us.

01:09:28.273 --> 01:09:31.839
You don't have to pretend.
I'm in the same situation.

01:09:31.948 --> 01:09:32.712
You are?

01:09:32.714 --> 01:09:33.727
I'm sure you've noticed

01:09:33.729 --> 01:09:35.200
that Lando
has feelings for me.

01:09:35.202 --> 01:09:36.738
Which makes
working together difficult

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:39.187
because I do not feel
the same way about him.

01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:40.584
Right.

01:09:40.675 --> 01:09:42.353
Yes, yeah.

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:43.893
Yeah, I see that.

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:46.715
Sometimes, I think...
Maybe.

01:09:47.444 --> 01:09:48.781
But, no.

01:09:50.723 --> 01:09:52.288
We're just not compatible.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.948
How would that work?

01:09:56.783 --> 01:09:57.784
It works.

01:10:07.932 --> 01:10:09.962
This is a precision job.

01:10:09.964 --> 01:10:12.583
Thermal vault will be
on the lowest level.

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:13.995
Down where it's warm.

01:10:13.997 --> 01:10:16.518
The only way
we're gonna pull this off

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.725
is if everybody
plays their part.

01:10:18.727 --> 01:10:20.579
Stick to the plan.

01:10:20.581 --> 01:10:22.716
Do not improvise.

01:10:27.484 --> 01:10:29.656
Mining colonies
are the worst.

01:10:29.658 --> 01:10:31.275
Yeah, well, "the worst"

01:10:31.277 --> 01:10:32.922
is where the money is.

01:10:35.087 --> 01:10:37.298
All right, people.
Time to shine.

01:11:13.783 --> 01:11:15.664
It won't be for long.

01:11:15.666 --> 01:11:17.595
Shut up, the both of you.

01:11:17.597 --> 01:11:19.356
I am Oksana Floren,

01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:21.817
Deputy Assistant Administrator
to the Vice-Admiral

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:24.670
of the Federation of
Trade Route Allocation

01:11:24.705 --> 01:11:26.183
and Monetization.

01:11:26.299 --> 01:11:28.679
Here with an offer
from his eminence,

01:11:28.681 --> 01:11:30.732
the Senior Vice-Admiral.

01:11:31.507 --> 01:11:34.371
Your spice for our
hard-working slaves.

01:11:34.450 --> 01:11:35.934
I brought you a sample.

01:11:36.027 --> 01:11:38.697
Tuul, bring forth
the merchandise.

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:09.253
Director Tolsite
said our slaves

01:12:09.255 --> 01:12:10.446
should follow those guys

01:12:10.448 --> 01:12:12.305
to get clipped
and tagged.

01:12:12.359 --> 01:12:14.492
What are they
clipping?

01:12:14.551 --> 01:12:16.654
Mmm-hmm.

01:12:18.249 --> 01:12:19.704
He wants us
to follow him.

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:24.499
Really?

01:12:24.501 --> 01:12:25.798
That's for that stunt
you pulled earlier,

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.190
you degenerate scum.

01:12:46.722 --> 01:12:48.393
He says all systems
in this sector

01:12:48.395 --> 01:12:50.528
of the facility operate
out of this room.

01:12:50.530 --> 01:12:52.225
It's how they're able
to maintain control

01:12:52.227 --> 01:12:54.184
over so many
with so few.

01:12:58.292 --> 01:13:00.333
The director says
their reconditioning process

01:13:00.335 --> 01:13:02.726
is excruciating
but effective.

01:13:17.903 --> 01:13:20.243
He said your security attache
can wait there.

01:13:20.335 --> 01:13:22.603
"Surely, we don't need him
to negotiate."

01:13:25.301 --> 01:13:26.811
Wait there, Tuul.

01:13:26.875 --> 01:13:28.610
Try not to bother anyone.

01:13:53.481 --> 01:13:54.583
Nice!

01:13:55.253 --> 01:13:56.047
That was the uniform

01:13:56.049 --> 01:13:58.630
that would've fit me
perfectly, but it's fine.

01:14:08.078 --> 01:14:09.880
Would you mind
holding this for me?

01:14:24.312 --> 01:14:25.606
Whoa.

01:14:25.608 --> 01:14:27.519
I have never see anyone do...

01:14:27.557 --> 01:14:28.517
What was that?

01:14:28.519 --> 01:14:30.716
Teras Kasi.

01:14:32.263 --> 01:14:33.911
Dryden taught me.

01:14:38.444 --> 01:14:39.549
Ah.

01:14:39.551 --> 01:14:40.817
Well negotiated.

01:14:50.973 --> 01:14:53.141
Excuse me.
I need to use this terminal.

01:14:53.232 --> 01:14:54.233
Hello?

01:14:55.483 --> 01:14:58.007
Can you hear me? Ugh.

01:14:58.394 --> 01:15:00.072
Restraining bolts...

01:15:00.153 --> 01:15:01.363
Barbaric.

01:15:03.328 --> 01:15:05.245
Congratulations!
You're liberated. Scoot.

01:15:05.249 --> 01:15:06.277
I don't know.

01:15:06.279 --> 01:15:07.725
Free your brothers and sisters
or something.

01:15:07.749 --> 01:15:09.320
Just give me some space.

01:15:15.346 --> 01:15:16.625
I'm in!

01:15:16.627 --> 01:15:17.693
<i>Han, can you hear me?</i>

01:15:17.695 --> 01:15:19.536
I kinda need to
know which way to go here.

01:15:19.723 --> 01:15:20.582
L3?

01:15:20.622 --> 01:15:22.304
The thermal vault
is down two levels,

01:15:22.306 --> 01:15:24.319
then left, then right,
then it's the third left.

01:15:24.359 --> 01:15:27.363
Right. That's a lot of
directions, but we're on it.

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:35.498
They're in subsector four,

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.949
coming up on gate X-3-7-1-K.

01:15:37.951 --> 01:15:39.187
Overriding!

01:15:45.507 --> 01:15:46.507
Freedom.

01:16:09.113 --> 01:16:11.175
What the hell
are you guys doing up there?

01:16:11.349 --> 01:16:13.252
I created a distraction!

01:16:18.114 --> 01:16:19.366
Come on! This way!

01:16:21.871 --> 01:16:23.743
Wait! What are you doing?

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:25.604
Come on,
we gotta get the coaxium.

01:16:27.908 --> 01:16:30.266
Hey! Remember what Beckett
said, stick to the plan.

01:16:30.268 --> 01:16:33.206
Chewie! Come on, let's go!

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:37.800
Fine!

01:16:40.088 --> 01:16:41.156
Chewie!

01:16:43.819 --> 01:16:45.317
Here, you might need this.

01:16:50.421 --> 01:16:52.423
Hope I see you around
sometime.

01:17:08.153 --> 01:17:09.448
Han, where are you?

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:11.286
<i>I'm on my way
to the vault.</i>

01:17:11.389 --> 01:17:12.561
<i>I lost Chewie.</i>

01:17:12.621 --> 01:17:13.637
He's dead?

01:17:13.639 --> 01:17:15.492
No, he had something
he had to do.

01:17:15.494 --> 01:17:16.755
<i>Is he coming back?</i>

01:17:16.795 --> 01:17:17.803
I don't know.

01:17:19.089 --> 01:17:21.092
Okay, they're on to us now.

01:17:30.923 --> 01:17:31.990
I'm at the vault.

01:17:39.815 --> 01:17:41.310
That's what I said!

01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:46.661
- Huh, that was impressive.
- Yeah.

01:17:46.983 --> 01:17:47.983
We're clear.

01:17:58.545 --> 01:17:59.674
Now what?

01:17:59.886 --> 01:18:01.616
<i>Han, each canister
should be equipped</i>

01:18:01.678 --> 01:18:02.876
<i>with a thermal display.</i>

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:04.058
Yeah, I see it.

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:07.190
If the internal temperature
reaches below 35 standard,

01:18:07.192 --> 01:18:10.323
<i>then the coaxium will
destabilize and explode.</i>

01:18:10.325 --> 01:18:12.812
Yup, I get it, guys.
It's dangerous.

01:18:21.659 --> 01:18:23.252
Okay, got it.

01:18:23.332 --> 01:18:25.067
Great. Only eleven more.

01:18:25.512 --> 01:18:26.513
Eleven?

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:36.973
The Calrissian Chronicles,
<i>chapter five.</i>

01:18:37.169 --> 01:18:38.688
<i>continued.</i>

01:18:38.690 --> 01:18:40.750
Personally, I wasn't all that
impressed with the Sharu.

01:18:40.752 --> 01:18:43.141
No sense of humor or style.

01:18:43.143 --> 01:18:45.293
Nonetheless,
there L3 and I were

01:18:45.296 --> 01:18:47.157
deep in their sacred temple.

01:18:47.215 --> 01:18:49.010
And that's when we saw it...

01:18:51.561 --> 01:18:53.094
Always something.

01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:57.436
You guys are not gonna believe
what I'm seeing up here.

01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:59.469
<i>Is it
a mass breakout?</i>

01:18:59.946 --> 01:19:00.921
L3, what did you do?

01:19:00.923 --> 01:19:03.019
I found my true purpose,
Lando.

01:19:03.021 --> 01:19:04.338
That's what I've done.

01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:08.282
I'm so glad
we took this job!

01:19:08.284 --> 01:19:09.755
That droid!

01:19:09.757 --> 01:19:10.917
L3, come on!

01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:15.799
Follow me, compatriots!

01:19:23.073 --> 01:19:24.951
Another couple guards
just spotted me.

01:19:24.953 --> 01:19:26.904
I don't have a free hand
to take 'em out.

01:19:26.906 --> 01:19:28.627
- What do I do?
<i>- Improvise.</i>

01:19:28.683 --> 01:19:30.585
You said never improvise!

01:19:39.246 --> 01:19:40.630
Hi!

01:19:40.685 --> 01:19:41.793
Don't forget that guy!

01:19:58.028 --> 01:19:59.983
Good to see you, buddy!

01:20:00.172 --> 01:20:02.254
Stay with me, Sagwa!
Keep up!

01:20:05.628 --> 01:20:07.371
Hey! I'm Chewie's
friend, Han.

01:20:10.105 --> 01:20:11.105
Okay.

01:20:38.407 --> 01:20:40.543
Han!

01:20:42.268 --> 01:20:43.269
Hey!

01:20:54.548 --> 01:20:55.637
Follow me.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.434
Rebellion!

01:21:10.561 --> 01:21:12.076
They're going for
the landing gear!

01:21:12.078 --> 01:21:13.421
We've gotta
get out of here!

01:21:15.283 --> 01:21:17.773
We need to keep 'em away
from those cannons!

01:21:25.877 --> 01:21:27.078
Catch that!

01:21:29.575 --> 01:21:31.420
Coaxium's stowed!
Let's go!

01:21:31.861 --> 01:21:33.236
Where's L3?

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:36.352
No more subjugation!

01:21:40.482 --> 01:21:41.790
L3!

01:21:41.799 --> 01:21:43.802
No, Lando!
Get back here!

01:21:46.457 --> 01:21:47.760
Lando!

01:21:48.815 --> 01:21:50.491
System failure.

01:21:50.493 --> 01:21:52.732
Have to reroute
the sensory modulators.

01:21:52.796 --> 01:21:54.413
It's all right.
Save your energy.

01:21:54.415 --> 01:21:56.179
I'm gonna get you outta here.
All right?

01:21:56.181 --> 01:21:57.816
System failure...

01:22:03.371 --> 01:22:04.521
Rerouting...

01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:07.204
Damn it!

01:22:07.206 --> 01:22:08.206
Han!

01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:15.062
Sagwa.

01:22:15.123 --> 01:22:16.558
This way!

01:22:17.313 --> 01:22:18.718
Come, come!

01:22:28.956 --> 01:22:30.624
Chewie!
Damn it!

01:22:34.441 --> 01:22:35.810
It's not responding.

01:22:53.081 --> 01:22:55.184
What are you
standing around for? Come on!

01:23:00.954 --> 01:23:02.512
It's okay,
you'll be fine.

01:23:04.226 --> 01:23:06.128
It's not responding...
Not responding...

01:23:06.722 --> 01:23:07.957
Han, get us out of here.

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:09.814
It's not responding.

01:23:09.816 --> 01:23:11.177
Han! Now!

01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:12.861
On it.

01:23:41.062 --> 01:23:42.282
- Lando...
- I'm here.

01:23:42.799 --> 01:23:44.561
- It's all right, L3.
- Lando...

01:23:44.563 --> 01:23:45.714
- I've got you.
- This is not...

01:23:45.716 --> 01:23:47.274
- It's okay, L3.
- Lando.

01:23:47.276 --> 01:23:49.709
It's all right. I can fix you.
I can fix you.

01:23:49.914 --> 01:23:51.114
Lando.

01:23:51.116 --> 01:23:53.167
What's happening to me?

01:23:55.869 --> 01:23:57.103
L3?

01:23:57.803 --> 01:23:58.872
L3!

01:24:05.992 --> 01:24:08.247
I'm sorry, girl.

01:24:08.249 --> 01:24:09.850
I'm so sorry.

01:24:23.733 --> 01:24:25.036
I could use a co-pilot.

01:24:49.425 --> 01:24:50.860
Sorry.

01:24:53.708 --> 01:24:54.662
With the cargo
we're carrying,

01:24:54.664 --> 01:24:55.889
if we don't make up
some lost time

01:24:55.891 --> 01:24:58.255
we're gonna be
in real trouble.

01:24:58.376 --> 01:24:59.902
How about that?
Is that real trouble?

01:25:06.490 --> 01:25:08.862
That is an Imperial blockade.

01:25:08.864 --> 01:25:10.541
What's it doing here?

01:25:10.543 --> 01:25:12.533
Probably heard about
your little rebellion.

01:25:14.246 --> 01:25:16.077
Nope.
Not gonna make it.

01:25:16.079 --> 01:25:17.309
We're gonna have to
drop the shipment.

01:25:17.311 --> 01:25:19.825
If we don't deliver,
Dryden will kill us.

01:25:19.827 --> 01:25:21.523
All right, trust me,
I know these guys.

01:25:21.525 --> 01:25:22.788
I used to be one of 'em.

01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:24.718
There's no way they're
gonna waste a TIE fighter

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.650
chasing down a little
rinky-dink freighter.

01:25:31.505 --> 01:25:32.228
You were saying?

01:25:32.230 --> 01:25:33.770
Usually,
in situations like this

01:25:33.772 --> 01:25:35.898
I like to turn around
in the opposite direction.

01:25:45.061 --> 01:25:46.562
I'm on the ventral gun.

01:25:51.932 --> 01:25:53.142
It's an easy equation.

01:25:53.144 --> 01:25:55.174
We simply don't have enough
time to get to Savareen

01:25:55.176 --> 01:25:56.397
before the canisters explode!

01:25:56.399 --> 01:25:57.773
Just have to find
a faster route.

01:25:57.775 --> 01:25:58.875
There isn't one!
You can't make

01:25:58.877 --> 01:26:00.662
the Kessel Run
in less than 20 parsecs.

01:26:00.664 --> 01:26:02.145
- Watch me.
- How?

01:26:02.201 --> 01:26:04.085
Take a shortcut,
through there.

01:26:05.012 --> 01:26:07.082
- Into The Maelstrom?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:26:07.084 --> 01:26:09.137
Spectacular way of killing
us all, I'll give you that.

01:26:09.139 --> 01:26:11.027
- Can't do it without L3.
- She's gone!

01:26:11.029 --> 01:26:12.418
You said yourself
she's got the best

01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:14.010
navigational database
in the galaxy.

01:26:14.012 --> 01:26:15.191
If we remove
her neural core,

01:26:15.193 --> 01:26:16.565
it's possible we can
download her brain

01:26:16.567 --> 01:26:18.715
into the <i>Falcon's</i>
navicomputer, right?

01:26:18.794 --> 01:26:19.795
Could we?

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.351
Theoretically.

01:26:21.353 --> 01:26:23.021
Only one way to find out.

01:26:25.897 --> 01:26:27.865
I got a really good feeling
about this.

01:26:42.283 --> 01:26:43.749
Oops, that's on me.

01:26:50.838 --> 01:26:52.174
Okay.

01:26:54.282 --> 01:26:56.125
Beckett, you see them?
They still on us?

01:26:59.332 --> 01:27:00.702
<i>Beckett, did you hear me?</i>

01:27:00.704 --> 01:27:01.965
<i>Are they on us?</i>

01:27:01.967 --> 01:27:04.050
Like rashnold on a kalak.

01:27:04.931 --> 01:27:06.430
I don't know
what that means.

01:27:06.461 --> 01:27:08.691
Like a gingleson's pelt.

01:27:08.943 --> 01:27:10.663
What?
Are they or aren't they?

01:27:10.665 --> 01:27:12.480
Yes, they're still on us!

01:27:14.622 --> 01:27:15.822
Whoo!

01:27:19.182 --> 01:27:23.999
This is why you never let
anyone fly your ship.

01:27:24.037 --> 01:27:25.073
Come on!

01:27:29.348 --> 01:27:32.028
Yeah, one just got past me.
He's right on top of us!

01:27:41.663 --> 01:27:43.032
<i>Good going, Han!</i>

01:27:49.036 --> 01:27:50.316
We need to
divert auxiliary power

01:27:50.318 --> 01:27:51.569
to the rear deflector shield.

01:27:51.571 --> 01:27:54.469
We definitely do!

01:28:01.125 --> 01:28:02.898
Since when do you know
how to fly?

01:28:05.372 --> 01:28:07.035
190 years old?

01:28:08.912 --> 01:28:10.139
You look great!

01:28:11.348 --> 01:28:12.610
Chewie, get in.

01:28:12.665 --> 01:28:13.746
I'll help Lando.

01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:31.024
Whoa!
That's my cape!

01:28:31.026 --> 01:28:32.803
Ah! That's a custom piece!

01:28:40.322 --> 01:28:42.253
What? Beckett, you with us?

01:28:42.255 --> 01:28:44.611
We just lost the cannon!

01:28:44.613 --> 01:28:46.576
And I really hurt
my thumbs.

01:28:46.663 --> 01:28:48.097
<i>There's still one on us.</i>

01:28:54.108 --> 01:28:55.544
Drop the landing gear.

01:28:56.074 --> 01:28:57.546
When I tell you,
flood the intake

01:28:57.548 --> 01:28:59.081
and sweep to the bi-lats.

01:29:02.776 --> 01:29:05.427
A little something I picked up
from my pal, Needles,

01:29:05.429 --> 01:29:07.378
best street racer
in all of Corellia.

01:29:08.449 --> 01:29:09.776
Till he crashed

01:29:09.903 --> 01:29:12.235
and died, doing this.

01:29:30.068 --> 01:29:31.702
Flood it, it's all yours!

01:29:43.472 --> 01:29:45.802
Nice move!

01:29:48.814 --> 01:29:50.515
Pull out her
internal processor.

01:29:53.526 --> 01:29:54.526
Sorry.

01:30:01.014 --> 01:30:02.138
We've got L3.

01:30:04.146 --> 01:30:05.661
Remove the mod calibrator.

01:30:05.663 --> 01:30:06.756
Make sure
the T-Line's connected.

01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:08.412
I'm gonna tuck it in.
Don't worry.

01:30:08.483 --> 01:30:09.446
You close?

01:30:09.448 --> 01:30:11.913
That coaxium's
getting real ripe.

01:30:12.156 --> 01:30:14.284
Okay.

01:30:16.182 --> 01:30:17.885
She's interfacing.

01:30:21.989 --> 01:30:23.892
She's part of the ship now.

01:30:35.474 --> 01:30:36.947
Where the hell are we?

01:30:36.991 --> 01:30:38.359
We're way off
the edge of the map.

01:30:39.125 --> 01:30:40.078
Wait.

01:30:40.134 --> 01:30:42.771
L3's constructing a model
of The Maelstrom.

01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:47.671
She says we're
approaching The Maw.

01:30:47.712 --> 01:30:48.841
That doesn't
sound like something

01:30:48.843 --> 01:30:50.349
we wanna be approaching.

01:31:11.414 --> 01:31:12.414
Hang on!

01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:18.809
This is The Maw?

01:31:18.811 --> 01:31:20.855
No, that's not The Maw.
I don't know what this is.

01:31:20.857 --> 01:31:22.092
That's a living thing.

01:31:36.817 --> 01:31:38.112
There!

01:31:38.190 --> 01:31:39.291
That's The Maw.

01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:43.675
It's a gravity well.

01:31:43.895 --> 01:31:44.973
I got an idea.

01:31:46.122 --> 01:31:47.903
Don't fly toward it, Han!

01:31:55.562 --> 01:31:56.835
See if it goes for this.

01:31:56.837 --> 01:31:58.672
No, what are you doing?
That's the escape pod!

01:32:00.141 --> 01:32:01.309
I know.

01:32:04.347 --> 01:32:05.617
Then why'd you do it?

01:32:13.037 --> 01:32:14.405
That's why, baby.

01:32:23.327 --> 01:32:24.494
She found a way out.

01:32:25.241 --> 01:32:27.854
90 degrees,
to the left... ish.

01:32:27.926 --> 01:32:28.855
Left-ish.

01:32:28.942 --> 01:32:30.221
I can't.

01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:32.140
It's taking everything we got
to stay out of The Maw.

01:32:32.164 --> 01:32:33.798
It's pulling us in.
We're stuck.

01:32:37.762 --> 01:32:40.218
We have enough raw coaxium
to power a dozen destroyers.

01:32:40.274 --> 01:32:42.212
Inject it into the fuel line,
it'll blow up the ship.

01:32:42.214 --> 01:32:43.645
Not the fuel line.

01:32:43.647 --> 01:32:45.889
But if we put one drop
into the fusion reactor,

01:32:45.944 --> 01:32:46.451
it might just...

01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:47.916
Give us the kick we need.

01:32:47.957 --> 01:32:49.724
All right, I'm on it!

01:32:54.147 --> 01:32:55.908
I know, we're getting
dragged in a circle.

01:33:09.979 --> 01:33:12.219
Once we get lined up,
it's gonna be a straight shot.

01:33:12.297 --> 01:33:13.340
As soon as that
coaxium ignites,

01:33:13.364 --> 01:33:14.169
we're gonna
tear out of here

01:33:14.171 --> 01:33:15.745
and the second we're
clear of The Maelstrom,

01:33:15.747 --> 01:33:17.138
we jump to lightspeed.

01:33:21.125 --> 01:33:22.273
Beckett!

01:33:22.275 --> 01:33:23.677
Can't talk!

01:33:27.626 --> 01:33:28.660
I see it.

01:33:53.205 --> 01:33:54.145
Beckett, hurry up!

01:33:54.147 --> 01:33:56.210
We only get one shot
at this thing!

01:33:56.540 --> 01:33:58.475
Shut up
and let me do this!

01:34:06.721 --> 01:34:09.323
Beckett, I'm gonna
count you down!

01:34:10.338 --> 01:34:11.672
Three!

01:34:14.593 --> 01:34:15.628
Two!

01:34:19.715 --> 01:34:20.853
Now!

01:34:20.922 --> 01:34:21.951
Now?

01:34:22.031 --> 01:34:23.031
Now!

01:34:39.037 --> 01:34:40.805
Oh, shoot...

01:34:53.556 --> 01:34:55.006
Chewie, when I tell you,
kick out the thrusters

01:34:55.008 --> 01:34:56.742
- and jump to lightspeed.
- Wait, what are we...

01:34:56.744 --> 01:34:57.946
Remember that alley
we slipped through

01:34:57.948 --> 01:34:59.108
in the Santhe Shipyards?

01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:01.159
Yeah, I remember!
I remember it didn't work.

01:35:01.161 --> 01:35:02.463
This time it's gonna.

01:35:12.675 --> 01:35:13.676
Punch it!

01:35:24.690 --> 01:35:26.792
<i>Savareen,
this is</i> Millennium Falcon.

01:35:26.794 --> 01:35:29.697
<i>We have coaxium that needs to
be off-loaded immediately.</i>

01:35:29.699 --> 01:35:32.137
<i>Like immediately,
immediately!</i>

01:35:33.044 --> 01:35:34.373
<i>We're here now...</i>

01:35:34.632 --> 01:35:35.733
<i>...see you. I...</i>

01:36:06.721 --> 01:36:08.934
Just did the Kessel Run
in 12 parsecs.

01:36:13.177 --> 01:36:15.117
Not if you round down, buddy.

01:36:15.472 --> 01:36:16.473
Yeah.

01:36:22.537 --> 01:36:24.807
She is a hell of a ship.

01:36:33.407 --> 01:36:34.869
I hate you.

01:36:34.933 --> 01:36:36.401
I know.

01:36:38.781 --> 01:36:40.778
I'm gonna be on my ship,

01:36:40.943 --> 01:36:42.737
in my quarters,

01:36:42.739 --> 01:36:45.811
waiting for you
to bring me my share.

01:36:48.019 --> 01:36:50.457
And then I don't ever
wanna see you again.

01:36:55.074 --> 01:36:56.475
Never?

01:37:10.239 --> 01:37:12.168
Where's your boss?

01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:14.678
Oh. Don't worry.
He'll be here.

01:37:15.921 --> 01:37:16.921
Then what?

01:37:17.357 --> 01:37:20.153
Well, you delivered,

01:37:20.452 --> 01:37:22.448
so you will get paid.

01:37:22.722 --> 01:37:25.114
You can buy that ship.

01:37:25.176 --> 01:37:28.346
You know that's not
what I'm asking.

01:37:31.017 --> 01:37:32.653
It can't happen.

01:37:36.914 --> 01:37:38.299
Because you're with Dryden?

01:37:38.301 --> 01:37:41.413
I'm not with him,
but I owe him.

01:37:43.142 --> 01:37:45.178
He helped me out
of a bad situation.

01:37:46.395 --> 01:37:48.425
And how long do you have
to pay off that debt?

01:37:51.903 --> 01:37:54.506
Everyone serves
somebody, Han.

01:37:55.359 --> 01:37:57.682
Even Dryden Vos.

01:37:57.728 --> 01:38:00.504
Look, you don't want to make
an enemy of Crimson Dawn

01:38:00.506 --> 01:38:02.955
which is exactly what you
and I would both be doing

01:38:02.957 --> 01:38:04.448
if I left here with you.

01:38:04.450 --> 01:38:06.291
I'm not afraid
of Crimson Dawn.

01:38:06.293 --> 01:38:08.424
I can take care of myself.

01:38:08.664 --> 01:38:10.036
You know,
I'm not the kid you knew

01:38:10.038 --> 01:38:11.607
on Corellia anymore, Qi'ra.

01:38:11.653 --> 01:38:12.740
- No?
- No.

01:38:12.742 --> 01:38:13.809
Then who are you?

01:38:14.795 --> 01:38:16.142
I'm an outlaw.

01:38:18.044 --> 01:38:19.324
What? I'm not kidding.

01:38:19.417 --> 01:38:20.634
Okay.

01:38:20.636 --> 01:38:23.528
Okay, outlaw,
you can tell yourself that,

01:38:23.677 --> 01:38:25.882
but I might be the only person
in the whole galaxy

01:38:25.884 --> 01:38:27.431
who knows
what you really are.

01:38:27.433 --> 01:38:29.328
Yeah.

01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:30.666
What's that?

01:38:33.072 --> 01:38:34.576
You are the good guy.

01:38:36.764 --> 01:38:39.527
I am not the good guy.

01:38:39.529 --> 01:38:43.193
I am definitely
not a good guy.

01:38:43.435 --> 01:38:44.867
I'm a terrible person.

01:38:45.414 --> 01:38:46.791
Hey!

01:38:46.793 --> 01:38:48.378
They say when
the coaxium's refined,

01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:49.928
we collect it up there.

01:39:14.468 --> 01:39:16.561
So, I hear
you make good brandy.

01:39:19.978 --> 01:39:21.413
<i>Beckett.</i>

01:39:46.144 --> 01:39:47.212
Don't.

01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:51.150
<i>You must've known
you'd see me again.</i>

01:39:51.152 --> 01:39:52.681
I was counting on it.

01:39:52.683 --> 01:39:54.998
Just didn't plan on it
being so soon.

01:39:56.147 --> 01:39:57.981
Of course now,
you've got a problem.

01:39:58.025 --> 01:39:59.928
Big problem.

01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:06.156
You happen to notice
that freighter down there?

01:40:06.297 --> 01:40:08.365
You know what's on it?

01:40:08.413 --> 01:40:10.260
About 30 hired guns.

01:40:10.262 --> 01:40:12.473
All I gotta do
is give 'em the signal,

01:40:12.475 --> 01:40:13.711
you're surrounded.

01:40:29.765 --> 01:40:31.767
Sorry.
You do your thing.

01:40:33.099 --> 01:40:35.442
By the time that coaxium
gets refined,

01:40:35.444 --> 01:40:37.244
Crimson Dawn will be here,

01:40:37.246 --> 01:40:39.250
so you go ahead
and kill us.

01:40:39.252 --> 01:40:41.147
They're gonna kill you.

01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:42.578
Perhaps
there's a compromise,

01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:44.371
one that doesn't involve
so much killing.

01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:46.735
They're marauders.

01:40:46.737 --> 01:40:48.873
They don't care
about anybody.

01:40:49.781 --> 01:40:51.683
All they know
how to do is kill.

01:41:15.192 --> 01:41:16.627
I need a drink.

01:41:17.115 --> 01:41:18.650
Bring them inside.

01:41:30.716 --> 01:41:32.651
My mother once told me

01:41:32.653 --> 01:41:34.011
about a band of mercenaries

01:41:34.013 --> 01:41:36.343
that came
to a peaceful planet.

01:41:36.536 --> 01:41:39.767
They had a resource there
these men coveted,

01:41:40.041 --> 01:41:41.904
so they took it.

01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:45.303
They kept coming back,
taking more.

01:41:45.305 --> 01:41:47.935
Until finally,
the people resisted.

01:41:48.216 --> 01:41:49.975
When they returned
demanding their tribute,

01:41:49.977 --> 01:41:53.641
the people shouted back
in one voice, "No more!"

01:41:53.931 --> 01:41:56.194
The mercenaries didn't like
the sound of that,

01:41:56.328 --> 01:41:57.226
so they cut off the tongue

01:41:57.228 --> 01:42:00.960
of every last man,
woman, and child.

01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:03.139
Do you know what
that pack of animals became?

01:42:04.823 --> 01:42:05.824
Tell them.

01:42:17.418 --> 01:42:19.279
Crimson Dawn and the rest
of the five Syndicates

01:42:19.281 --> 01:42:20.813
have committed
unspeakable crimes

01:42:20.815 --> 01:42:22.021
across the galaxy.

01:42:23.633 --> 01:42:25.223
Says you.

01:42:25.287 --> 01:42:26.315
No.

01:42:26.436 --> 01:42:28.308
Says them.

01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:30.365
Each of our worlds
has been brutalized

01:42:30.367 --> 01:42:32.160
by the Syndicates.

01:42:32.162 --> 01:42:33.777
Crimson Dawn
will use their profits

01:42:33.779 --> 01:42:34.997
from the coaxium you stole

01:42:34.999 --> 01:42:37.456
to tyrannize
system after system

01:42:37.531 --> 01:42:39.626
in league with the Empire.

01:42:39.628 --> 01:42:41.648
And what would you
use it for?

01:42:42.456 --> 01:42:44.219
The same thing my mother
would have used it for

01:42:44.221 --> 01:42:46.758
if she had survived
and still wore the mask.

01:42:48.203 --> 01:42:49.430
To fight back.

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.996
We're not marauders.

01:42:53.224 --> 01:42:54.960
We're allies

01:42:55.658 --> 01:42:57.461
and the war
has just begun.

01:43:13.460 --> 01:43:16.756
You know we can't give
the coaxium to Dryden Vos.

01:43:16.867 --> 01:43:18.880
Joining the cause,
Han Solo?

01:43:18.882 --> 01:43:21.277
Just trying
to make it out alive.

01:43:21.446 --> 01:43:22.450
Got a plan?

01:43:22.452 --> 01:43:23.947
Yeah, beginning of one.

01:43:24.059 --> 01:43:24.646
Way to get our money

01:43:24.648 --> 01:43:25.534
and get out from
under the thumb

01:43:25.536 --> 01:43:27.829
of Crimson Dawn
at the same time.

01:43:27.876 --> 01:43:30.397
Maybe get your girlfriend back
while we're at it.

01:43:31.217 --> 01:43:34.008
You don't tangle
with Dryden.

01:43:34.010 --> 01:43:37.340
Because unlike us,
he actually does travel

01:43:37.419 --> 01:43:40.103
with hired guns,
his own private army.

01:43:40.598 --> 01:43:42.160
So does Enfys.

01:43:42.293 --> 01:43:44.529
Listen, here's what
I got so far.

01:43:46.577 --> 01:43:48.445
What do you think
they're saying?

01:43:51.969 --> 01:43:53.602
He's gonna try to help you.

01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:01.056
I see.

01:44:02.332 --> 01:44:06.060
Lot of ways it could go south,
and only one where it doesn't.

01:44:06.062 --> 01:44:08.564
That's why I need my partner.

01:44:12.817 --> 01:44:14.651
Not this time.

01:44:14.954 --> 01:44:16.450
I'm leaving.

01:44:16.452 --> 01:44:18.581
If you're smart,
you'll come with me.

01:44:18.717 --> 01:44:20.846
I thought you didn't
believe in running.

01:44:20.877 --> 01:44:23.114
I prefer it to dying.

01:44:50.587 --> 01:44:53.185
If by some miracle
you make it out of here,

01:44:53.288 --> 01:44:54.789
find me on Tatooine.

01:44:55.618 --> 01:44:57.547
What's on Tatooine?

01:44:57.549 --> 01:44:58.586
Heard about a job,

01:44:58.588 --> 01:45:01.418
big shot gangster
putting together a crew.

01:45:01.833 --> 01:45:03.562
That'll be the one.

01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:04.539
The one?

01:45:04.541 --> 01:45:06.738
My last score.

01:45:06.882 --> 01:45:08.444
Yeah, I still got
some debts to pay

01:45:08.446 --> 01:45:11.048
before I can head back
to Glee Anselm

01:45:11.736 --> 01:45:13.738
and get into the valachord.

01:45:47.114 --> 01:45:48.393
Welcome home.

01:45:48.395 --> 01:45:50.291
He's waiting for you.

01:45:50.386 --> 01:45:51.387
Thanks, Toht.

01:45:53.341 --> 01:45:54.827
Weapons.

01:45:54.829 --> 01:45:56.131
I didn't bring 'em.

01:45:57.769 --> 01:45:59.137
They're fine.

01:46:03.493 --> 01:46:05.295
We're gonna win.

01:46:08.344 --> 01:46:10.642
It's not that kind
of game, Han.

01:46:11.783 --> 01:46:12.988
The object isn't to win.

01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:15.142
It's just to stay in it
as long as you can.

01:46:18.297 --> 01:46:19.765
You don't know everything.

01:46:20.807 --> 01:46:22.008
No.

01:46:24.305 --> 01:46:26.622
Just a bit more than you.

01:46:34.749 --> 01:46:35.749
I knew it!

01:46:36.532 --> 01:46:37.576
My men, they all said,

01:46:37.578 --> 01:46:39.932
"There's no way
they pull this off."

01:46:39.934 --> 01:46:41.616
"Qi'ra's not ready."
That's what they said,

01:46:41.618 --> 01:46:43.753
but I had faith anyway.

01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:47.009
Where's Beckett?

01:46:47.169 --> 01:46:48.472
Beckett didn't make it.

01:46:52.555 --> 01:46:53.420
Tell me.

01:46:53.422 --> 01:46:55.853
Job took a bad turn
on Kessel.

01:46:56.246 --> 01:46:58.065
He died saving my life.

01:46:58.222 --> 01:47:00.212
How are you holding up?
You all right?

01:47:00.302 --> 01:47:00.970
I'm okay.

01:47:00.972 --> 01:47:02.667
All right, good.

01:47:02.958 --> 01:47:04.670
Colo claw fish, anyone?

01:47:04.672 --> 01:47:06.039
- No. Thank you.
- No?

01:47:06.041 --> 01:47:08.635
You know, whatever Beckett's
shortcomings may have been,

01:47:08.637 --> 01:47:09.655
I always admired him.

01:47:09.657 --> 01:47:11.422
He was a man of principles.

01:47:11.424 --> 01:47:13.887
When he made a commitment,
he honored it

01:47:13.889 --> 01:47:16.210
and I think we can
all take solace

01:47:16.212 --> 01:47:18.688
in knowing how proud
he would've been

01:47:18.690 --> 01:47:22.263
to see you here,
following his example.

01:47:22.324 --> 01:47:23.974
Han and Chewbacca
behaved admirably.

01:47:23.976 --> 01:47:25.438
They'll make
reliable smugglers,

01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.768
should we ever
have the need

01:47:26.770 --> 01:47:28.557
when they get
their own ship.

01:47:28.559 --> 01:47:30.928
Qi'ra.
Come here.

01:47:32.873 --> 01:47:34.626
We'd really appreciate
the opportunity

01:47:34.628 --> 01:47:36.385
to work for you again, sir.

01:47:36.387 --> 01:47:37.778
I would've been
inconsolable

01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:39.622
if anything had
happened to you, my dear.

01:47:40.904 --> 01:47:43.033
I have no one else
in my life

01:47:43.425 --> 01:47:46.027
that I trust in the way
that I trust you.

01:47:49.756 --> 01:47:52.829
Well, I guess we'll just
take our payment

01:47:52.831 --> 01:47:53.623
and get going.

01:47:53.625 --> 01:47:54.748
I'm sure you've got
competitors to crush...

01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:55.916
What?

01:47:55.918 --> 01:47:57.427
...and black markets
to dominate.

01:47:57.429 --> 01:47:59.793
Oh. Show me what
you've brought me first.

01:48:00.507 --> 01:48:02.666
You want me to open it?

01:48:02.668 --> 01:48:04.704
Oh, yes, Han.
I really do.

01:48:31.282 --> 01:48:32.642
Bring me one.

01:48:32.644 --> 01:48:35.102
I don't think
that's a good idea, Dryden.

01:48:35.104 --> 01:48:37.501
It's very explosive stuff.

01:48:38.052 --> 01:48:40.283
I never ask
for anything twice, Han.

01:49:00.979 --> 01:49:02.447
Careful.

01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.354
It's magnificent.

01:49:08.933 --> 01:49:10.162
How'd you do it?

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:11.120
Wasn't easy.

01:49:11.122 --> 01:49:12.114
No, I mean,
how'd you do it?

01:49:12.116 --> 01:49:15.214
It looks exactly
like the real thing.

01:49:15.587 --> 01:49:17.575
That's
'cause it is the real thing.

01:49:17.599 --> 01:49:18.272
Yes, and I'm saying

01:49:18.274 --> 01:49:20.429
I would believe you.
It's that good.

01:49:20.497 --> 01:49:22.261
But my associate
already told me

01:49:22.263 --> 01:49:25.118
about your plan to rob me
of my money

01:49:25.167 --> 01:49:27.931
and give the real coaxium
to Enfys Nest.

01:49:27.933 --> 01:49:29.639
Dryden, I don't know
what you're thinking

01:49:29.641 --> 01:49:31.190
or what Qi'ra
may have told you...

01:49:31.192 --> 01:49:33.575
No, not Qi'ra.
Not Qi'ra.

01:49:33.577 --> 01:49:34.868
Qi'ra, it turns out

01:49:34.934 --> 01:49:36.554
has a weak spot for you,

01:49:36.556 --> 01:49:38.385
and we'll deal
with that later.

01:49:38.387 --> 01:49:42.350
No, I'm talking about
my other associate.

01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:44.393
Can you come in
and join us, please?

01:49:56.275 --> 01:49:59.411
I am sorry, kid.

01:50:02.582 --> 01:50:03.943
Why?

01:50:04.282 --> 01:50:05.111
Come on.

01:50:05.151 --> 01:50:07.147
Don't look at me like that.

01:50:07.187 --> 01:50:08.177
You weren't paying attention.

01:50:08.179 --> 01:50:10.942
I told you,
"Don't trust anybody."

01:50:11.908 --> 01:50:14.080
Am I wrong about that?

01:50:16.518 --> 01:50:17.665
Uh-uh-uh.

01:50:18.282 --> 01:50:20.027
Back away from that.

01:50:20.029 --> 01:50:21.923
Put your paws
where I can see 'em.

01:50:22.062 --> 01:50:23.897
Check that lid.

01:50:26.044 --> 01:50:27.406
Clever.

01:50:27.630 --> 01:50:29.342
It's too late.

01:50:29.382 --> 01:50:31.775
Coaxium's refined,
and Enfys has it.

01:50:31.777 --> 01:50:34.113
Well, we figured that.

01:50:48.321 --> 01:50:50.075
Drop your weapons.

01:50:53.673 --> 01:50:56.578
<i>It's over.
We got them.</i>

01:50:56.736 --> 01:50:57.907
And there we have it.

01:50:57.909 --> 01:50:59.845
Excellent work,
Aemon, thank you.

01:50:59.847 --> 01:51:01.568
Qi'ra, help me.

01:51:03.912 --> 01:51:05.248
Tell me what to do.

01:51:06.317 --> 01:51:08.067
What would you do

01:51:08.156 --> 01:51:12.194
if the person you most
trusted in the world

01:51:12.768 --> 01:51:14.237
betrayed you?

01:51:16.990 --> 01:51:18.403
I would want
to know why.

01:51:20.616 --> 01:51:22.779
If it was
a moment of weakness

01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:23.956
or something else.

01:51:24.005 --> 01:51:25.007
And then what?

01:51:26.551 --> 01:51:29.581
And then,
I would ask that person

01:51:29.621 --> 01:51:31.875
to prove their loyalty

01:51:31.877 --> 01:51:35.614
by sacrificing
something they love.

01:51:44.040 --> 01:51:46.172
I tried to warn you
about her.

01:51:46.438 --> 01:51:48.915
You know, you're wrong
about one thing.

01:51:49.044 --> 01:51:50.306
What?

01:51:50.346 --> 01:51:52.643
I was paying attention.

01:51:52.683 --> 01:51:54.951
You told Chewie
people are predictable.

01:51:57.489 --> 01:51:59.591
You're no exception.

01:52:05.252 --> 01:52:06.381
It's empty.

01:52:06.445 --> 01:52:07.888
<i>The case is empty.</i>

01:52:07.890 --> 01:52:10.300
Aemon, what's going on?
What's happening there?

01:52:10.302 --> 01:52:11.837
Aemon?

01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:12.900
Talk to me.

01:52:38.849 --> 01:52:41.579
I hope you didn't send
all your fancy enforcers

01:52:41.581 --> 01:52:43.280
because that would leave you

01:52:43.282 --> 01:52:45.736
a little shorthanded
around here.

01:52:46.691 --> 01:52:48.130
So,

01:52:48.132 --> 01:52:52.587
if that case is empty,
then the real coaxium...

01:52:52.667 --> 01:52:54.536
Leaves here
with one of us.

01:52:59.602 --> 01:53:00.980
Beckett,
what are you doing?

01:53:00.982 --> 01:53:02.030
Thinking.

01:53:02.082 --> 01:53:03.431
And I prefer to be
the only one

01:53:03.498 --> 01:53:05.322
holding a blaster
while I'm doing it.

01:53:05.370 --> 01:53:06.974
Han, grab that coaxium,

01:53:06.976 --> 01:53:08.273
put it in the case.

01:53:08.275 --> 01:53:10.050
Big stuff,
you're coming with me.

01:53:11.758 --> 01:53:13.099
Don't do this,
Beckett.

01:53:13.101 --> 01:53:14.896
- We had a deal.
- Yeah.

01:53:14.898 --> 01:53:15.749
I'm sorry,

01:53:15.829 --> 01:53:17.392
but I'm also an entrepreneur.

01:53:17.394 --> 01:53:19.974
I mean, you of all people
understand that.

01:53:20.228 --> 01:53:21.228
Come on, let's go.

01:53:22.436 --> 01:53:24.093
You're making
a huge mistake.

01:53:24.176 --> 01:53:25.439
Won't be my first.

01:53:25.497 --> 01:53:27.068
It's gonna be your last.

01:53:27.331 --> 01:53:28.500
Maybe.

01:53:29.435 --> 01:53:30.841
Why you gotta be
so negative?

01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:44.968
Han,

01:53:44.970 --> 01:53:46.321
now's as good a time as any

01:53:46.323 --> 01:53:48.419
to reevaluate
our relationship.

01:53:48.939 --> 01:53:49.939
How so?

01:53:50.613 --> 01:53:52.561
I was just thinking,

01:53:52.563 --> 01:53:55.561
why don't we join forces
and go get Beckett together?

01:53:55.563 --> 01:53:58.433
That is a great idea.
Let's do it. You go first.

01:53:59.908 --> 01:54:01.710
Oh, Han.

01:54:28.384 --> 01:54:30.746
You can't win, Han,
and even if you could,

01:54:30.805 --> 01:54:32.012
you'd spend
the rest of your life

01:54:32.014 --> 01:54:33.326
looking over your shoulder.

01:54:34.415 --> 01:54:35.416
You know what?

01:54:36.392 --> 01:54:38.349
I'm kind of getting
used to the idea.

01:54:45.717 --> 01:54:47.311
I'm sorry.

01:54:47.383 --> 01:54:48.792
Han, she's done things that

01:54:48.794 --> 01:54:51.591
you could never understand,
but I do.

01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:54.269
I understand her completely.

01:54:55.157 --> 01:54:57.531
Once you're a part
of Crimson Dawn,

01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:59.335
you can't leave.

01:54:59.375 --> 01:55:01.079
It's not true.

01:55:01.180 --> 01:55:02.609
I know you.

01:55:02.813 --> 01:55:04.917
It's what I was taught.

01:55:04.919 --> 01:55:06.808
Find your
opponent's weakness,

01:55:06.919 --> 01:55:08.212
and use it,

01:55:08.252 --> 01:55:10.355
and today...

01:55:12.352 --> 01:55:13.691
I'm yours.

01:55:39.934 --> 01:55:41.402
I had to.

01:55:41.998 --> 01:55:44.060
Yeah.
No, I mean, you did...

01:55:44.742 --> 01:55:46.678
You did.

01:55:48.789 --> 01:55:50.945
Beckett and Chewbacca,
you have to go after them.

01:55:51.005 --> 01:55:52.201
What are you gonna do?

01:55:52.203 --> 01:55:54.965
Well, if we give
all the coaxium to Enfys,

01:55:55.070 --> 01:55:57.741
we're gonna need something
to buy our ship with.

01:56:11.503 --> 01:56:14.132
- Qi'ra...
- Go and save Chewbacca.

01:56:14.180 --> 01:56:17.251
He needs you and you're
gonna need him, too.

01:56:23.718 --> 01:56:24.719
Smile.

01:56:27.571 --> 01:56:28.853
That's the word.

01:56:30.011 --> 01:56:31.165
Whenever I imagined myself

01:56:31.167 --> 01:56:33.103
off with you
on some adventure...

01:56:34.545 --> 01:56:36.614
Always makes me smile.

01:56:44.091 --> 01:56:45.927
Go. I'm right behind you.

01:57:37.802 --> 01:57:39.113
<i>Yes?</i>

01:57:39.115 --> 01:57:42.512
I regret to inform you
that Dryden Vos is dead,

01:57:42.766 --> 01:57:44.481
murdered by the thief
he hired

01:57:44.483 --> 01:57:46.087
to steal
the coaxium shipment,

01:57:46.089 --> 01:57:47.351
his friend,

01:57:47.550 --> 01:57:49.412
Tobias Beckett.

01:57:49.745 --> 01:57:51.528
<i>Is that so?</i>

01:57:52.317 --> 01:57:55.547
<i>Where is the shipment now?</i>

01:57:55.924 --> 01:57:57.085
Gone.

01:57:57.125 --> 01:57:58.125
Beckett took it.

01:57:58.201 --> 01:58:00.838
Slaughtered the others.
I alone survived.

01:58:03.622 --> 01:58:06.856
<i>One man couldn't have
done this alone.</i>

01:58:07.708 --> 01:58:09.424
I wasn't there,

01:58:09.426 --> 01:58:12.063
but if I had been, perhaps
I could have saved him.

01:58:20.292 --> 01:58:23.723
<i>Bring the ship and
come to me on Dathomir</i>

01:58:23.725 --> 01:58:25.755
<i>and you and I
will then decide</i>

01:58:25.757 --> 01:58:28.551
<i>what to do about
the traitor, Beckett,</i>

01:58:28.607 --> 01:58:31.043
<i>and his accomplices.</i>

01:58:33.172 --> 01:58:34.308
I'm on my way.

01:58:36.890 --> 01:58:38.119
<i>Qi'ra,</i>

01:58:38.121 --> 01:58:39.449
<i>you and I</i>

01:58:39.451 --> 01:58:42.752
<i>will be working
much more closely</i>

01:58:42.861 --> 01:58:44.830
<i>from now on.</i>

01:59:14.936 --> 01:59:17.065
You're relentless.
I'll give you that.

01:59:18.463 --> 01:59:20.565
Came as fast
as I could, buddy.

01:59:21.070 --> 01:59:22.471
Dryden dead?

01:59:24.481 --> 01:59:26.316
Qi'ra kill him?

01:59:28.105 --> 01:59:30.668
Still don't get it,
do you, kid?

01:59:30.918 --> 01:59:33.154
It was never about you.

01:59:33.423 --> 01:59:34.991
She's a survivor.

01:59:36.159 --> 01:59:37.715
You know what
your problem is?

01:59:37.717 --> 01:59:39.785
You think
everybody's like you.

01:59:40.556 --> 01:59:42.243
Not you, kid.

01:59:42.245 --> 01:59:43.680
You're nothing like me.

01:59:45.688 --> 01:59:47.327
I hope you're still
paying attention

01:59:47.329 --> 01:59:49.406
because now I'm gonna tell
you the most important...

02:00:04.577 --> 02:00:07.024
You made
the smart move, kid.

02:00:07.027 --> 02:00:08.583
For once.

02:00:09.991 --> 02:00:11.592
I woulda killed you.

02:00:18.941 --> 02:00:23.857
I really was gonna
learn to play that valachord.

02:00:23.974 --> 02:00:25.176
I know.

02:02:18.377 --> 02:02:19.857
That's it.
It's all loaded.

02:02:23.868 --> 02:02:25.464
Do you know
what that really is?

02:02:25.527 --> 02:02:26.442
Yeah.

02:02:26.444 --> 02:02:29.429
About 60 million credits
worth of refined coaxium.

02:02:29.431 --> 02:02:30.742
No.

02:02:30.744 --> 02:02:33.182
It's the blood that brings
life to something new.

02:02:33.427 --> 02:02:35.527
Yeah, what?

02:02:35.529 --> 02:02:36.565
A rebellion.

02:02:37.765 --> 02:02:39.583
You could come with us,
you know.

02:02:39.585 --> 02:02:41.914
We need warriors
and leaders like you.

02:02:48.468 --> 02:02:50.631
Maybe someday
you'll feel different.

02:02:51.022 --> 02:02:53.291
Don't hold your breath, kid.

02:03:08.064 --> 02:03:09.250
Don't lose that.

02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:23.142
Very few people
have actually seen

02:03:23.300 --> 02:03:24.652
the StarCave Nebula.

02:03:24.721 --> 02:03:26.021
It's breathtaking.

02:03:26.046 --> 02:03:27.532
Not unlike your eyes.

02:03:27.690 --> 02:03:29.762
How much do you know about
intertwined celestial bodies?

02:03:29.764 --> 02:03:31.983
Because I happen to be
something of an authority.

02:03:32.935 --> 02:03:34.187
By the way...

02:03:40.436 --> 02:03:41.865
Han!

02:03:41.983 --> 02:03:43.116
You're alive!

02:03:43.118 --> 02:03:44.445
Yeah, no thanks to you.

02:03:44.447 --> 02:03:46.211
I should have Chewie
rip your arms off.

02:03:46.213 --> 02:03:47.742
In fact, Chewie, do it.

02:03:47.744 --> 02:03:48.919
Hey, Han!
We are friends.

02:03:48.921 --> 02:03:50.635
You know that.
We're friends. All right?

02:03:55.835 --> 02:03:57.711
Oh, look at you.

02:03:57.713 --> 02:03:59.604
Thought he was gonna
rip your arms off.

02:03:59.725 --> 02:04:00.683
I knew you were kidding.

02:04:00.685 --> 02:04:01.529
No, you didn't.

02:04:01.531 --> 02:04:03.352
- So, where's my cut?
- Your cut?

02:04:04.459 --> 02:04:06.675
No, I don't think so.
We barely made it out alive.

02:04:06.677 --> 02:04:08.479
All we ended up with
was that.

02:04:09.271 --> 02:04:10.900
Mmm-mmm.

02:04:10.902 --> 02:04:12.425
Figure it's worth
about 10,000,

02:04:12.427 --> 02:04:14.148
maybe enough
for a decent buy-in.

02:04:16.269 --> 02:04:17.705
You want a rematch?

02:04:19.075 --> 02:04:20.343
Why not?

02:04:24.252 --> 02:04:26.215
You fold now,

02:04:26.285 --> 02:04:27.160
you walk away with enough

02:04:27.162 --> 02:04:29.257
to get yourself
your own little ship.

02:04:29.873 --> 02:04:31.176
You call,

02:04:32.272 --> 02:04:33.977
I'm gonna
clean you out again.

02:04:46.505 --> 02:04:47.831
I don't know,
I'm feeling lucky.

02:04:50.044 --> 02:04:52.640
Ooh.

02:04:52.758 --> 02:04:55.121
You really have it bad
for the <i>Falcon,</i> don't you?

02:04:55.193 --> 02:04:57.824
It's mutual, trust me.
She belongs with me.

02:05:07.475 --> 02:05:09.971
You got everything
you need there, pal?

02:05:19.795 --> 02:05:21.263
Not bad.

02:05:21.639 --> 02:05:24.281
Not bad. You know,

02:05:24.283 --> 02:05:28.127
if you'd only had
this little green sylop,

02:05:28.129 --> 02:05:29.626
you would've beaten this.

02:05:35.477 --> 02:05:38.446
Fair and square, baby.
Fair and square.

02:05:49.143 --> 02:05:50.671
Beckett said
he heard about this

02:05:50.673 --> 02:05:52.962
very big gangster
putting together a job.

02:05:53.751 --> 02:05:55.919
No, I'm telling ya,

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.288
it's gonna be great.

02:05:57.401 --> 02:05:59.271
When have I ever
steered you wrong?
