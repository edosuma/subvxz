Status support.

00:19.382 --> 00:22.338
No sign of the enemy, Skipper.
And the objective is still there.

00:22.948 --> 00:23.906
Outstanding.

00:24.221 --> 00:25.085
Move out.

00:35.422 --> 00:38.955
Rico, enemy spotted.
And they're nearing the objective.

00:49.142 --> 00:52.895
{\pos(220,230)}I think we can secure
the flag without lethal force.

01:12.088 --> 01:13.923
Private, go for the split.

01:26.556 --> 01:28.938
Does this look like
I am becoming sick to you?

01:29.226 --> 01:30.773
A little yellow-greenish maybe?

01:31.129 --> 01:33.405
- Look at it.
- You are sick.

01:33.732 --> 01:36.946
It's a flag, ringtail,
as in "Capture The Flag".

01:37.316 --> 01:39.567
- Capture the who-what?
- Capture the flag.

01:39.692 --> 01:41.531
- It's a game.
- A training exercise.

01:41.656 --> 01:43.472
For elite forces,

01:43.869 --> 01:45.221
aka, not you.

01:46.461 --> 01:48.515
Who is more elite than me?

01:48.640 --> 01:50.876
I shall play
this flag capturing game,

01:51.001 --> 01:53.696
and when I say play,
of course I mean win.

01:53.864 --> 01:56.259
Negative.
No civiles allowed.

01:57.520 --> 01:58.372
I see.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.127
Are you a penguin or a chicken?

02:01.605 --> 02:03.531
This calls for harsh mocking.

02:17.694 --> 02:19.655
I am still mock-mock mocking.

02:29.407 --> 02:30.551
Well done, boys.

02:44.528 --> 02:45.766
All right, you win.

02:46.478 --> 02:48.718
But now you're gonna lose.

02:49.720 --> 02:53.052
The object of the training exercise
is simplicity itself.

02:53.495 --> 02:56.425
The first team to capture this wins.

02:57.493 --> 02:59.528
Done.
Where are my prizes now?

02:59.696 --> 03:03.132
- Not that simple.
- Prizes, tell me about the prizes!

03:03.609 --> 03:06.950
If by some statistically
remote chance you do win,

03:07.075 --> 03:10.006
the rewards are respect and glory.

03:10.343 --> 03:11.841
And a swagger in your step.

03:12.258 --> 03:14.242
These prizes sound cheap.

03:14.615 --> 03:18.125
As your King,
I already own glory and respect,

03:18.250 --> 03:19.940
- don't I?
- Glorify!

03:20.065 --> 03:21.597
Respectify!

03:21.985 --> 03:23.819
See?
But not a TV.

03:25.338 --> 03:29.125
Long have I been wanting a box
with tiny shouting people inside.

03:29.623 --> 03:30.793
And you'll put up?

03:35.712 --> 03:37.043
Is he housebroken?

03:39.284 --> 03:41.198
All right, deal.

03:49.447 --> 03:50.513
Target sighted.

03:50.941 --> 03:53.194
Skipper, what if we lose the TV?

03:53.319 --> 03:54.755
Not possible, Private.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.652
Those lemurs don't have the skills.

03:57.884 --> 03:59.288
But they do have the flag.

03:59.728 --> 04:00.523
I win.

04:01.981 --> 04:04.627
Prizes, prizes, I get the prizes.

04:09.398 --> 04:12.201
This will go nicely
in my breakfast nook.

04:12.772 --> 04:14.441
Good bye, tele, old chum.

04:17.331 --> 04:18.382
Buck up, men.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.541
We may have lost the battle...

04:20.666 --> 04:23.235
- And the tele.
- And that.

04:24.257 --> 04:25.979
But not the war, right?

04:26.393 --> 04:29.118
Do I hear a rematch in the remaking?

04:29.480 --> 04:31.854
That was beginner's luck.
We go again.

04:33.160 --> 04:35.809
I do like
possessing your possessions.

04:37.159 --> 04:41.163
When I win,
this hi-fi will be my-fi.

04:41.545 --> 04:42.969
We'll see about that.

04:43.094 --> 04:45.268
Actions speak louder than words.

04:45.852 --> 04:48.882
And this speaks louder than actions!

04:49.979 --> 04:51.107
Okay, lemur.

04:51.404 --> 04:52.308
Let's play.

04:57.644 --> 04:59.882
Package is ready for pickup.

05:05.197 --> 05:06.155
Smoked salmon!

05:06.457 --> 05:08.613
I like winning.
It's good.

05:08.738 --> 05:11.727
It suits me, like losing suits them,

05:12.057 --> 05:13.784
the loser penguins.

05:18.290 --> 05:19.856
It just doesn't compute.

05:19.981 --> 05:22.389
No land mammal
should be able to move that fast.

05:22.646 --> 05:23.821
I'll take that.

05:25.805 --> 05:27.696
The whole world's gone topsy-turvy.

05:27.821 --> 05:30.413
So it's up to us
to make turvy topsy again.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.149
I'm not sure that's even possible.

05:34.311 --> 05:36.062
We want a rematch.

05:37.101 --> 05:40.089
Dan from San Diego
is going for the $50,000.

05:40.394 --> 05:41.524
Foolishly, for me.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.292
- Now.
- What?

05:43.460 --> 05:44.281
Now.

05:50.708 --> 05:54.203
- You penguins are so pokey slow.
- Rematch.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.808
New crown.
You like?

05:59.267 --> 06:00.042
Rematch.

06:04.293 --> 06:07.917
Peekaboo, I see you... losing.

06:08.275 --> 06:09.752
Rematch, rematch, rematch.

06:10.586 --> 06:12.288
Pay upwards, losers.

06:28.326 --> 06:30.707
From now on, I name you...

06:31.267 --> 06:32.657
Carlotta.

06:33.754 --> 06:34.810
Talk to me, baby.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.548
- Let it go, man.
- Keep it together, Rico.

06:39.895 --> 06:41.097
Thanks to you.

06:41.222 --> 06:44.854
When you have more goodies for me,
I will be happy to shamify you again.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.224
- Shame!
- Mort, high five.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.389
No, higher.

06:51.970 --> 06:52.974
Higher still.

06:54.935 --> 06:56.523
Is that all you got, really?

06:57.422 --> 06:58.998
Fine, low five then.

07:06.562 --> 07:07.612
This stinks.

07:08.254 --> 07:09.725
We could blow something up.

07:09.850 --> 07:12.632
A powerful explosion
would turn that frown upside down.

07:18.361 --> 07:20.790
Nothing left, even inside Rico.

07:21.335 --> 07:24.260
Good news.
We have nothing left to lose.

07:24.428 --> 07:26.315
It was enough they had to beat us.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.264
Why'd they have to stoop
to name-calling?

07:28.580 --> 07:30.285
Flightless? That hurt.

07:31.008 --> 07:32.435
Flightless.

07:32.603 --> 07:34.570
Flightless, that's it.

07:34.938 --> 07:38.074
- Kowalski, what did you say earlier?
- "This stinks."?

07:38.242 --> 07:40.810
- Before that.
- "Mama, I made boom-boom?"

07:40.978 --> 07:42.012
Too far back.

07:42.137 --> 07:43.913
No land mammal can move that fast?

07:44.227 --> 07:47.149
Bingo! Lemurs don't travel by land.

07:47.566 --> 07:49.772
They travel by tree.

07:49.994 --> 07:51.535
Head of the class, Kowalski.

07:51.660 --> 07:54.323
While we carried out
land-based operations,

07:54.658 --> 07:57.760
our lemur foes were gliding
right over our heads.

07:57.928 --> 07:59.195
We never stood a chance

08:00.484 --> 08:03.110
because we were playing
the wrong game.

08:03.379 --> 08:05.165
It's as if life has meaning again.

08:05.398 --> 08:07.536
But, wait, we know how they beat us.

08:07.896 --> 08:09.772
But we don't know how to beat them.

08:10.164 --> 08:11.907
Look to the sky, boys.

08:12.253 --> 08:13.806
Look to the sky.

08:14.530 --> 08:16.538
<i>Did you pay too much
for auto insurance?</i>

08:16.663 --> 08:18.047
It is very possible.

08:18.215 --> 08:19.115
Tell me more.

08:21.185 --> 08:22.852
Mort, no slacking!

08:23.174 --> 08:25.777
How am I to know
if I have auto-paid too much?

08:28.622 --> 08:30.105
<i>It's one, and two,</i>

08:30.584 --> 08:31.879
<i>and one, and two.</i>

08:36.408 --> 08:39.967
- Do it, Maurice.
- Lemur, one last game,

08:40.515 --> 08:42.138
all or nothing.

08:42.549 --> 08:45.541
But I have the all,
and you have the nothing.

08:45.709 --> 08:47.376
So how does that work?

08:47.814 --> 08:49.312
Kowalski, options.

08:49.843 --> 08:50.928
Sorry, Skipper.

08:51.053 --> 08:53.371
We lost my options clipboard
two nights ago.

08:54.314 --> 08:56.555
Right-i-o.
Maurice, options.

08:56.917 --> 08:59.422
They could swear
their undying loyalty to you.

08:59.590 --> 09:02.892
Groveling, obeying,
and combing the knots out of my tail?

09:03.155 --> 09:04.478
That'd be the idea.

09:05.548 --> 09:06.963
I likey.

09:07.282 --> 09:09.243
We accept those terms.

09:12.962 --> 09:14.270
The enemy is on the move.

09:15.063 --> 09:16.872
Gentlemen, commence shaking.

09:19.087 --> 09:20.409
Now light these candles.

09:26.675 --> 09:28.851
I'm flying.
I'm fly...

09:32.000 --> 09:33.623
What is it, Private?
Spit it out.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.057
Yes, sir.

09:35.225 --> 09:36.325
Oh, a bug.

09:43.369 --> 09:46.369
Those silly-billy penguins
cannot be beating me.

09:46.708 --> 09:49.624
- It is impossible.
- Think again, lemur.

09:54.884 --> 09:57.380
The impossible just became possible.

09:57.873 --> 10:00.075
They're... they're...
They're flightless birds.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.285
- They... they...
- They're flying!

10:03.406 --> 10:05.239
Terror from above.

10:13.104 --> 10:13.863
Terror!

10:30.918 --> 10:32.815
Game, set, and match.

10:37.356 --> 10:39.948
So when he said all or nothing...

10:40.073 --> 10:42.441
He really meant... all.

10:46.334 --> 10:49.252
Victory is sweetest
when you've tasted defeat,

10:50.267 --> 10:52.451
No, victory is sweetest

10:52.999 --> 10:54.785
on the lemur's bouncy.
