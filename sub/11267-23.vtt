"A Tale of Two Parties"
Closed captioned

00:02.001 --> 00:02.961
Previously on 90210:

00:03.086 --> 00:04.045
You and I
belong together.

00:04.171 --> 00:05.130
We can overcome anything.

00:05.255 --> 00:06.173
Maybe we're the ones

00:06.298 --> 00:07.466
that are meant to be together.

00:07.591 --> 00:08.383
NAVID:
You slept with Silver.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.470
She told you?
No, you just did.

00:11.595 --> 00:12.930
ANNIE:
I knew about your faith,

00:13.054 --> 00:15.850
and I knew you were going
into the priesthood, and...

00:15.975 --> 00:18.226
I knew we couldn't
be together.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.354
I hope you don't feel
like you made a mistake.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.230
Annie, I'll never regret it.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.357
Even Dixon
wouldn't burn down a house

00:23.482 --> 00:24.900
and frame his roommate for it.

00:25.024 --> 00:26.861
I had to do what I had to do
to protect someone, okay?

00:26.986 --> 00:29.029
There's a lot more to that story
that you don't know.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.031
What is this for Dixon--
a prank gone wrong?

00:31.156 --> 00:32.073
I'd go to jail

00:32.198 --> 00:33.701
for prostitution.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.661
I made real sacrifices for you.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.830
I am asking you to step up
and do what's right.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.373
Having it come out
that I was a prostitute

00:39.498 --> 00:40.666
is the last thing
that I need.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.041
IVY:
Why would you give him

00:42.167 --> 00:43.168
a fake ID?

00:43.293 --> 00:44.294
Because I don't have
a real one.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.797
I'm in this country
illegally.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.508
Looks like I got a positive ID
on the suspect in the 207.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.343
There are really good guys
out there.

00:51.468 --> 00:55.096
Actually, I loved
a really good guy once.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.432
That mean you'll still
plan my wedding?
Yes, of course.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.601
Here's the groom now.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.897
Naomi, I'd like you
to meet...

01:03.022 --> 01:04.230
Max?

01:09.987 --> 01:12.280
I do.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.747
Naomi.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.415
What?

01:21.540 --> 01:23.083
I-I said I...
I do like it.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.752
Oh.
A lot.

01:24.877 --> 01:25.544
Good, good. Sorry.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.295
I just spaced out
there for a second.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.172
It's still a
little crazy

01:29.297 --> 01:30.966
that I am planning
your wedding.

01:31.090 --> 01:32.927
I know.
Small world, huh?

01:33.052 --> 01:34.929
You were telling me
about your business.

01:35.054 --> 01:37.848
It's a software
that helps Fortune 500 companies

01:37.973 --> 01:39.975
maximize their use
of social media marketing

01:40.099 --> 01:41.602
in the B-to-B sector.

01:41.727 --> 01:43.437
Our IPO raised
$80 million.

01:43.562 --> 01:44.479
Oh.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.565
I do not understand
a word you said

01:46.690 --> 01:48.567
up until $80 million, but
that part sounds great.

01:48.692 --> 01:49.693
I'm so happy for you.

01:49.818 --> 01:50.444
Thanks.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.279
I do think that
you should take

01:52.404 --> 01:53.822
this jacket off
and try the one

01:53.948 --> 01:55.032
that I had sent
over earlier.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.701
Okay. There we go.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.954
Take that off.
Yeah.

02:00.079 --> 02:03.707
You must be pulling
a lot of strings for this.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.751
And I know it...
it seems a little fast,

02:05.876 --> 02:08.586
but ever since Madison
and I met, it's just been

02:08.711 --> 02:10.714
this whirlwind romance.

02:10.839 --> 02:11.757
Oh.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.551
Well, I guess, when you
know, you know, right?

02:18.097 --> 02:20.515
Max.
Yeah?

02:20.641 --> 02:23.018
Are you sure you're okay with
me planning your wedding?

02:23.143 --> 02:25.437
I'm fine with it-- if you are.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.939
Of course, yeah.

02:27.064 --> 02:28.148
Honestly, I'm just
concerned about Madison.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.984
I mean, it must be

02:30.109 --> 02:32.193
hard for her
with our history and all that.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.570
No, don't worry about her.

02:33.695 --> 02:36.323
She's not like...
you know, other girls.

02:36.448 --> 02:39.159
She, uh... she doesn't have
a jealous bone in her body.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.035
She's just

02:40.160 --> 02:42.621
sweet and happy.

02:42.746 --> 02:43.914
Max? (whimpers)

02:44.039 --> 02:45.540
Honey, are you... you okay?

02:45.666 --> 02:47.208
What's wrong?

02:47.334 --> 02:48.043
My maid of honor
just called.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.837
She has shingles.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.672
My bachelorette party
is tomorrow night.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.633
Naomi, I'd
hate to ask--

02:54.758 --> 02:55.383
you've already
done so much--

02:55.509 --> 02:57.218
but would you
mind hosting?

02:57.344 --> 02:59.763
Oh...
It's all planned.
All you'd have to do

02:59.888 --> 03:01.348
is make sure everything
runs smoothly.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.017
Planning your wedding
is one thing,

03:03.142 --> 03:06.353
but hosting your bachelorette--
that's... not weird for you?

03:06.478 --> 03:08.105
You mean because
of you and Max?

03:08.271 --> 03:09.064
It's fine.

03:09.188 --> 03:10.774
We all have a past.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.901
In junior high, I was
obsessed with Nick Carter.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.778
Oh.
MAX:
Yeah, we're talking

03:14.903 --> 03:17.322
Backstreet Boys locker shrine.
(laughs)

03:17.447 --> 03:19.033
MADISON: Like you
and Max, it's...

03:19.158 --> 03:20.659
ancient history.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.244
Right, ancient history.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.164
Good.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.957
I'm glad we agree on that.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.375
Then it's settled.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.252
Thank you so
much, Naomi.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.381
You are just...
the best.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.348
Or second best.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.107
"Newcomer Liam Court

03:52.232 --> 03:53.525
"should stop trying
to save the planet

03:53.650 --> 03:56.653
and go back to
modeling underwear."

03:56.778 --> 03:58.488
Yeah. Can we please
change the subject?

03:58.613 --> 04:01.700
I don't want to think
about the movie or the premiere.

04:01.825 --> 04:02.826
Hey, I'm just trying
to lighten the mood.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.912
That night wasn't exactly great
for me, either.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.205
Why?
What'd you burn down this time?

04:06.329 --> 04:07.497
I guess that's what
everybody thinks.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.583
I'm the arsonist
who got kicked out of college.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.960
Which makes it
kind of hard to get a job.

04:12.086 --> 04:13.670
Unless you want
to give me one.

04:13.795 --> 04:14.588
Thought you were, uh, managing

04:14.713 --> 04:16.423
Adrianna's new
country music career.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.548
ADRIANNA:
No.

04:17.673 --> 04:18.716
Not anymore.

04:18.841 --> 04:19.801
Hi.
Hey.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.012
Hey.
Hey.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.346
(sighs)

04:23.471 --> 04:25.140
Look, I hope you didn't
invite me here

04:25.265 --> 04:27.226
to try to talk me
into working together,

04:27.350 --> 04:29.603
because I really can't work
with someone I don't trust.

04:29.728 --> 04:30.562
Hey, I just wanted you to know

04:30.687 --> 04:32.814
that I got a call
from Bruno Jacoby,

04:32.940 --> 04:34.274
and he wants to shoot
your music video.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.944
Are you kidding me?
Nope.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.820
And no matter what
you think of me,

04:38.946 --> 04:41.031
I'm not the kind of guy who
wouldn't pass that along.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.784
So there you go.

04:43.909 --> 04:46.203
And hey, man, I am sorry
about your movie review.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.663
I know what it's like to have
everybody think you suck.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.002
For the record,
I thought you

04:54.128 --> 04:55.796
were the best part
of that movie.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.464
(chuckles)
Yeah, thanks.

04:57.589 --> 05:00.175
But it's not really the
review I'm worried about.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.384
It's Silver.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.178
She's going
through so much.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.846
This is the last
thing she needs.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.515
(sighs)

05:07.641 --> 05:10.393
How is she?

05:10.518 --> 05:12.687
I think she's...
still confused.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.606
Good.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.191
How is that good?

05:16.316 --> 05:17.859
'Cause it means
I have a shot.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.320
As long as she doesn't know
for sure what she wants,

05:20.445 --> 05:21.571
I'm going to keep fighting
for what I want.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.164
Excuse me.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.624
Uh, do you happen to know where
I could find Caleb Walsh?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.042
I really need
to speak to him.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.086
He quit the seminary.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.213
He quit?
Yes. He said
he feels

05:38.337 --> 05:39.965
he's no longer worthy
of the cloth.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.800
That's exactly what
I was afraid of.

05:41.925 --> 05:45.095
He's punishing himself
for something that I did.

05:45.220 --> 05:47.806
I am the terrible person,
not him.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.724
Can you just talk to him

05:49.850 --> 05:51.810
or, you know,
forgive him or something?

05:51.935 --> 05:53.687
I can.

05:53.812 --> 05:56.355
And God forgives
without reservation.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.399
But he needs to forgive himself,

05:58.525 --> 06:01.611
and with people,
it's usually not that simple.

06:07.408 --> 06:10.162
(instrumental country music
playing over stereo)

06:12.122 --> 06:13.540
So what do you think?

06:13.665 --> 06:14.373
Is it country enough?

06:14.499 --> 06:16.168
I mean, yeah, the music's good.

06:16.293 --> 06:17.169
Yeah?
It's a little wordy, though.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.129
(chuckles) Very funny.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.630
See, that's my problem.

06:20.755 --> 06:23.217
I need to come up with a
good hook, and I'm so stumped.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.510
Bruno Jacoby said
that I need to write

06:25.635 --> 06:27.262
something personal
and from the heart.

06:27.386 --> 06:29.973
Maybe you can get some
inspiration from my

06:30.098 --> 06:31.432
cancer strategy appointment.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.018
There's a sad country song
if I've ever heard one.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.728
Believe it or not,

06:34.853 --> 06:36.230
that song
would probably be a hit.

06:36.355 --> 06:40.317
But I will... look elsewhere.

06:40.441 --> 06:43.778
Maybe something...
in this magazine, perhaps.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.572
(chuckling)

06:45.697 --> 06:47.991
I can't believe I'm
in the tabloids.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.117
What has my life come to?

06:49.243 --> 06:50.785
Well, you
look pretty.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.746
The real question is...

06:52.871 --> 06:55.332
"What will she choose?

06:55.456 --> 06:58.293
Bedroom eyes or bedroom abs?"

06:58.417 --> 07:00.962
Pretty sure both those guys
hate me right now.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.631
Picked a really good time
to alienate my support system.

07:09.470 --> 07:10.931
Hey.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.515
Uh... (chuckles)
Hey, man.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.350
What are you doing here?

07:13.474 --> 07:15.685
Uh, I'm looking
for a job.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.604
Oh.
Yeah, Ade cut me
loose, and, you know,

07:17.729 --> 07:19.981
I didn't want to push
her into anything.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.276
So I got to find another
way to make some money.

07:22.401 --> 07:24.361
Hey, uh, listen, man.

07:24.485 --> 07:27.364
I'm really sorry I was...
I was hard on you,

07:27.488 --> 07:29.241
you know, when you
came back in town.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.785
I guess I was just, uh,
looking out for Dixon.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.036
Yeah, I know.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.579
It's cool, you know?

07:34.704 --> 07:37.291
(low chatter)

07:37.416 --> 07:39.500
It just sucks when an
innocent party gets punished

07:39.626 --> 07:41.669
for something
they didn't do.
Yeah.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.797
What are you doing here?
Don't you go to Princeton?

07:43.922 --> 07:45.715
No, not anymore. I'm, uh,
picking up a course schedule.

07:45.840 --> 07:46.883
I'm enrolling at CU.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.343
Nice.
Yeah,

07:48.468 --> 07:49.677
with what's going on
with Silver,

07:49.803 --> 07:51.263
uh, think I should be here.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.640
I mean, I just... I heard
what happened with her and Liam.

07:53.765 --> 07:54.975
You're being a lot
cooler about it

07:55.100 --> 07:56.393
than I would be.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.270
I-I'm not going to lie--
it's-it's, uh...

07:58.395 --> 08:00.063
it's not the best
news I ever heard.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.149
But it's not like
she cheated on me.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.025
She was just, uh, you know,
in a vulnerable place.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.902
If anyone's to
blame, it's Liam.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.779
I mean, he really took
advantage of her.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.531
Mm-hmm.
Like you said, punish
the guilty party.

08:10.657 --> 08:11.699
Yeah.
MAX:
Hey, guys.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.243
Hey, whoa!
Max Miller.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.077
What's going on?

08:14.202 --> 08:16.288
Max Miller 2.0.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.747
Hey, uh, what's this...

08:17.872 --> 08:19.540
what's this about
you getting married?

08:19.666 --> 08:20.334
Actually, that's why I'm here.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.002
Uh, Naomi's hosting Madison's...

08:22.127 --> 08:24.838
uh, my fiancée's bachelorette,
and it just got me thinking

08:24.963 --> 08:26.714
that you guys should come
to my bachelor party.

08:26.840 --> 08:27.966
Dude, I'm honored.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.259
I already talked to Liam,

08:29.384 --> 08:31.303
and-and he generously
offered the Offshore.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.388
Oh. Yeah, Liam, uh...

08:33.513 --> 08:35.849
he loves to share
everything.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.058
Austin, you should
come, too.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.311
You're serious?

08:39.436 --> 08:40.770
After everything
that happened with Naomi,

08:40.895 --> 08:42.105
and you want me at your party?

08:42.230 --> 08:44.149
The band that I hired
had to back out,

08:44.274 --> 08:46.151
and I know you got
a lot of connections

08:46.276 --> 08:47.902
in the music industry, so I...

08:48.028 --> 08:50.322
I thought maybe you could, uh,
handle the entertainment.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.907
Uh...

08:55.035 --> 08:56.244
Yeah, I could do that.

08:56.370 --> 08:58.288
Great.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.956
Great.
Hey, I'm in.

09:00.081 --> 09:00.957
All right, well,
I'll see you both there.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.542
Hey, congrats.
Thanks, man.

09:02.667 --> 09:03.168
Really good to see you.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.627
You, too.
Yeah.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.171
All right, man.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.547
Catch you later.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

09:11.510 --> 09:13.928
Time to punish the guilty.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.659
IVY:
Has anyone seen Diego Flores?

09:36.784 --> 09:38.286
Hey, buddy.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.620
Excuse me. Does...

09:39.746 --> 09:42.207
does anybody here
know Diego Flores?

09:42.332 --> 09:43.417
Please?

09:43.542 --> 09:43.917
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.044
Ivy, right?

09:46.169 --> 09:47.379
Yeah.

09:47.504 --> 09:48.838
Yeah, we all know
Diego, all right?

09:48.963 --> 09:49.923
He's, uh...
he's our boy.

09:50.048 --> 09:52.467
But, you know, none of
these guys have papers, either,

09:52.592 --> 09:55.136
so they don't really want
to be seen talking to you

09:55.262 --> 09:56.637
after what happened with Diego.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.348
Okay, I never meant
to get him in trouble.

09:58.473 --> 09:59.724
All right? I turned myself in.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.143
I-I agreed to their
court-mandated therapy.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.728
I mean, come on,
maybe the police

10:03.853 --> 10:05.021
will work something out
for him, too.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.398
Diego's undocumented.

10:06.523 --> 10:07.774
All right, they catch him,

10:07.899 --> 10:09.443
convict him of a felony,
he's deported.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.236
Come on,
there has to be something

10:11.361 --> 10:12.571
that I can do here.
You're the
whole reason

10:12.695 --> 10:14.489
he's hiding out
in the first place.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.074
All right, you've already
caused enough trouble.

10:16.199 --> 10:19.286
Leave him alone.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.621
Look, if you really
care about Diego,

10:21.746 --> 10:23.498
you'll never see him again.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.505
ANNIE: Would you
put down the implants?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.215
Naomi,
this is a doctor's office,

10:32.340 --> 10:33.716
not Girls Gone Wild.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.093
Oh, speaking of,
I'm hosting

10:35.218 --> 10:36.636
Little Miss Perfect's
bachelorette party

10:36.761 --> 10:38.305
tomorrow night.
You're all coming.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.515
Wait. Madison
invited us?

10:40.640 --> 10:43.310
Well, apparently,
she has no problem whatsoever

10:43.435 --> 10:46.020
with the fact that Max
was once obsessed with me.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.106
She says his friends
are her friends, so yeah.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.107
And she even wants
Ade to sing.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.234
Oh, that's so sweet.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.402
(chuckles)

10:52.527 --> 10:53.820
Too sweet.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.489
No one is that perfect,
despite what Max thinks.

10:55.614 --> 10:57.115
ANNIE:
All right.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.742
Is it possible that you may be--
and just hear me out--

10:59.867 --> 11:01.286
a teensy bit jealous?

11:01.411 --> 11:02.912
Me, jealous?

11:03.037 --> 11:05.499
Um, I'm sorry, it's not like
she's better than me.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.417
She has flaws, too.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.002
She just hides them better
than most people.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.295
Hmm.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.838
Seriously, guys,
what if she has some

11:11.963 --> 11:13.006
deep dark secret
from her past or something.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.925
I mean, I thought PJ was the
second coming of Chris Pine,

11:16.050 --> 11:17.385
and look what happened
with that.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.346
Well, you've got a point there.

11:19.471 --> 11:22.641
Exactly. I have to figure out
that girl's flaws.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.392
For Max's sake.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.186
Hi, Erin.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.728
Hey.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.397
I'm Dr. Bronson.

11:29.523 --> 11:34.319
So, I hear you're ready to talk
about a surgery schedule.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.322
Oh, uh, well, yeah,
I'm not sure yet.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.449
But until I take care of this,
I feel like

11:39.574 --> 11:41.284
I'm a walking time bomb,
you know?

11:41.409 --> 11:42.910
I understand.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.330
It's nice that you have
so much support.

11:45.455 --> 11:48.291
Oh, we're just hear to
help her pick out implants.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.709
Personally, I think, go
big or go home. (chuckles)

11:50.835 --> 11:53.630
Um, choosing breast size is

11:53.754 --> 11:55.215
probably one of
the easier parts.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.883
But you have a lot
you need to decide.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.843
Like what?

11:58.968 --> 12:01.929
A preventative mastectomy
won't affect your fertility.

12:02.055 --> 12:05.308
But a lot of women
put off having

12:05.433 --> 12:07.768
their ovaries removed until
after they've had children.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.270
But if she waits too long,

12:09.396 --> 12:11.189
then she could get
ovarian cancer, right?

12:11.314 --> 12:13.441
The risks do increase
with time.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.984
But I thought
she could have kids later

12:15.109 --> 12:17.028
if she freezes her eggs.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.489
Fertilized embryos offer
a greater success rate.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.658
Are you currently
in a relationship?

12:21.782 --> 12:24.785
Actually, she's in two.
No, I'm not
in any relationship.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.829
Is that a problem?
No, not at all.

12:26.954 --> 12:29.957
But if you were and you
wanted to have children,

12:30.083 --> 12:32.168
it's optimal to do it
before either surgery.

12:32.293 --> 12:35.463
The good news is, once you
decide what you want,

12:35.589 --> 12:37.131
you have a lot of choices.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.183
Hi.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.686
I'm looking for, uh,
Erin Silver?

12:49.810 --> 12:51.062
She's still in
with the doctor.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.813
You can have a seat.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.441
Great, thanks.
(chuckles)

12:58.069 --> 12:59.487
What are you doing here?

12:59.613 --> 13:02.115
I'm here for Silver.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.199
Liam, I have this covered, okay?

13:03.324 --> 13:04.701
This has gone on
a little too far, okay?

13:04.825 --> 13:06.119
You need to back off.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.870
Look, I get that you're pissed.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.498
But I'm not backing off
until Silver tells me to.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.875
Every time I come
here for answers,

13:13.000 --> 13:14.961
I wind up leaving with a
thousand more questions.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.337
Oh, try not
to worry.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.838
You're not
going through it alone.

13:17.964 --> 13:18.757
NAVID:
Yeah, good thing
you're in a doctor's office.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.593
You won't have far to go
when I break your face.

13:21.718 --> 13:22.969
Are you kidding me?

13:23.094 --> 13:24.471
I've taken harder punches
from my grandma.

13:24.596 --> 13:25.764
Hey, guys, hey!

13:25.888 --> 13:27.265
What are you two doing here?

13:27.390 --> 13:28.807
(clears throat)
Um, I'm here for you.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.644
He just got here.
I was here for you
ten minutes ago.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.856
I can't do this
right now.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.075
Okay, what's the big emergency?

13:46.200 --> 13:46.785
And if you're going to try
and get me on your side

13:46.909 --> 13:47.327
about the whole Silver thing,
you can forget about it.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.578
But seriously, Liam, really?

13:48.703 --> 13:49.870
I know it's 5:00 somewhere,

13:49.996 --> 13:51.623
but that's his sixth beer.

13:59.172 --> 14:02.759
Caleb, are you drunk?

14:02.883 --> 14:05.470
For the first time in my
life, I am no longer

14:05.595 --> 14:07.681
bound by the
laws of virtue.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.683
I know that you quit
the seminary because of me,

14:09.808 --> 14:12.226
because of who I am
and what I've done.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.228
Annie, I didn't quit
because of that.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.273
I quit because I'm weak.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.609
I broke my vow.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.736
I gave in to temptation.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.404
Well, even if that is true,
do you really think

14:23.530 --> 14:24.781
that drinking is going to help?

14:24.905 --> 14:27.992
What do you recommend that I do,
start a charity?

14:28.117 --> 14:29.285
Sell some tote bags?

14:29.410 --> 14:31.371
It didn't make you
any happier, did it?

14:31.496 --> 14:32.955
We both made mistakes,

14:33.080 --> 14:35.542
and we have to deal
with the consequences.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.299
Nice.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.843
What, you and your boyfriend
just kickin' back,

14:44.967 --> 14:46.135
sipping on some brews?

14:46.260 --> 14:48.471
What, no crazies
need committing today?

14:48.596 --> 14:50.973
Look, Caleb really was just
trying to help, Ivy.

14:51.098 --> 14:54.352
You were the one who introduced
Caleb into my life, all right?

14:54.477 --> 14:57.230
And if he hadn't had me
committed to that mental ward,

14:57.355 --> 14:58.732
well, then Diego never would
have busted me out of it,

14:58.857 --> 14:59.858
in which case,
he wouldn't currently

14:59.982 --> 15:01.776
be hiding from the cops,
while I'm here wondering

15:01.901 --> 15:03.444
if I'm ever even going
to see him again.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.530
What do you mean?
I can't find him, all right?

15:05.655 --> 15:06.989
His friends won't tell me
where he is, I mean,

15:07.114 --> 15:09.033
he's lost everything
and it's all because of me.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.535
Do you have any idea
how that feels?

15:12.871 --> 15:14.163
I never even got
to say good-bye.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.583
Ivy, I never...
Whether you meant
to or not,

15:16.708 --> 15:19.126
Annie, you got to be
a little bit more careful

15:19.252 --> 15:21.212
when you're messing
with somebody else's life.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.885
♪ ♪

15:27.009 --> 15:28.386
SILVER:
So...

15:28.511 --> 15:31.097
bachelorette
in an aquarium

15:31.222 --> 15:32.766
with, uh, lemonade.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.183
Maybe Madison's big,
deep, dark secret

15:34.308 --> 15:36.310
is that she's eight.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.271
I'm gonna loosen this party
up a little bit

15:38.396 --> 15:40.690
and find out.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.483
Okay, everyone,

15:42.609 --> 15:45.486
it is time for bride
and groom trivia.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.405
You thought of all
your questions,

15:47.530 --> 15:51.117
they're in the hat and now,
after a sip of this,

15:51.242 --> 15:54.161
Madison, your first question.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.955
Okay.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.709
Oh, this one
is a little racy.

15:59.834 --> 16:02.002
NAOMI:
Nice, ladies.

16:02.128 --> 16:05.005
"Where did Madison
first kiss Max?"

16:05.131 --> 16:06.382
On the cheek!

16:06.507 --> 16:07.634
MADISON:
True.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.844
I forgot my question.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.137
Oopsie.

16:11.262 --> 16:13.932
There you go.
Okay.

16:14.056 --> 16:17.602
"What is the dirtiest thing
Madison has ever done?"

16:17.727 --> 16:19.395
I know this!

16:19.520 --> 16:22.816
At sleepaway camp,
she and Fritzy

16:22.941 --> 16:26.152
snuck into the boys' side
one night and drilled holes

16:26.277 --> 16:28.655
in the bottom of all
their canoes!

16:28.780 --> 16:30.364
Well, that's scandalous,
isn't it?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.366
Ha! Next question.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.786
"How many kids

16:34.911 --> 16:37.246
do Max and Madison want
to have?" You guys!

16:37.371 --> 16:38.623
I'm not even married yet.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.207
I don't want to
think about kids.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.543
I'm going to get some air.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.588
MADISON:
Three boys and three girls.

16:50.969 --> 16:53.972
Hey.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.015
Did you know that
the male sea horse

16:56.140 --> 16:58.476
carries all the little
baby sea horses?

16:58.601 --> 16:59.894
Really?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.521
Yeah.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.272
Mom just gives up her eggs
and lets the guy

17:03.397 --> 17:04.482
do all the work.
Wow!

17:04.607 --> 17:06.859
Way to go female sea horses!

17:06.984 --> 17:10.029
Yeah.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.030
Can I ask you something?

17:11.155 --> 17:14.032
Yeah, of course.

17:14.157 --> 17:17.369
What was it like to be
pregnant with Maisy?

17:17.494 --> 17:18.829
I mean, you were there.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.665
Yeah, but...

17:20.790 --> 17:22.959
I remember reading the
letter that you wrote her

17:23.083 --> 17:24.251
when she was
just a day old.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.212
And you said
something about

17:26.337 --> 17:28.715
having two heartbeats
inside of you.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.341
Yeah. I mean, as scary as it was

17:30.466 --> 17:32.259
knowing that she was growing,

17:32.385 --> 17:33.887
the first time

17:34.012 --> 17:36.305
that I felt her kick...
Yeah.

17:36.430 --> 17:40.184
it was the most amazing
experience in my life.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.813
Want to hear something crazy?

17:43.938 --> 17:46.607
Yeah.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.442
When I thought I was pregnant,

17:48.568 --> 17:51.612
I was totally freaked out...

17:51.738 --> 17:54.156
and overwhelmed.

17:54.281 --> 17:58.661
But when I found out that it was
just a false alarm...

17:58.786 --> 18:01.330
I sort of missed it.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.290
That's not so crazy.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.084
Okay?

18:05.209 --> 18:07.503
Sometimes it takes

18:07.628 --> 18:10.339
a loss to show us
what we really want.

18:11.298 --> 18:13.300
Like, with me and you.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.929
When things were bad between us,

18:16.054 --> 18:17.513
all I could think of was

18:17.638 --> 18:19.473
trying to get
our friendship back.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.393
I'm glad that you
never gave up on us.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.437
(laughs)
Me , too.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.568
NAVID:
You really tricked out
the Offshore.

18:30.693 --> 18:31.819
I hardly recognize it.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.072
Well, you know,
I thought...

18:34.196 --> 18:35.656
now that I have
a little money,

18:35.782 --> 18:37.283
it might be nice to
treat my friends.

18:37.408 --> 18:39.159
Yeah, you sure have
a lot of them, huh?

18:39.285 --> 18:40.119
Well...

18:40.244 --> 18:42.080
to tell you the truth,

18:42.204 --> 18:44.331
I don't really know
all of these guys.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.500
I mean, I think some
of them work for me,

18:46.626 --> 18:49.003
but my assistant
sent out the invite.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.421
Yeah, I guess when
you're a huge success,

18:50.546 --> 18:52.423
everyone wants
a piece of you.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.217
Must be hard to know who
your real friends are.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.804
Uh, speaking
of fake friends.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.680
Max, what's up?
Hey.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.307
This is, uh, Caleb.

19:01.432 --> 19:02.558
Hey.
Hey, man.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.685
So, this party has
an open bar, right?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.395
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.397
Bless you.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.108
You invited
a drunk priest

19:10.232 --> 19:11.484
to a bachelor party?

19:11.609 --> 19:12.652
He's been here
all day.

19:12.777 --> 19:15.154
He was too drunk
to let him leave.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.490
Max, you've done well
for yourself.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.700
Hey, what about you?
I mean, you're, uh,

19:19.826 --> 19:21.744
I mean, I'd trade
all my stock options

19:21.869 --> 19:23.162
to make out
with an alien.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.664
Yeah, well, you might
feel differently

19:24.789 --> 19:25.539
once you read the reviews.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.458
Yeah, it's kind of
hard to believe

19:27.583 --> 19:28.876
they hated
your performance.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.878
I mean, this guy has
so much experience

19:31.004 --> 19:32.463
pretending to be my
friend all these years.
See, he's just

19:32.588 --> 19:33.547
upset because
I slept with Silver

19:33.673 --> 19:35.716
and now she can't get me
out of her head.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.218
Wow. I-I've been a little
out of the loop.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.804
Oh, no, you haven't
missed anything.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.515
He's still the same jerk
he was in high school.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.225
The guy who thinks he can
get any girl he wants,

19:45.351 --> 19:47.020
but, uh, we're not in
high school anymore.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.479
Guys, come on.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.149
Can we just, can we
just have some fun?
Yeah, hey,

19:51.273 --> 19:52.566
I could have some fun
kicking your ass at darts.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.610
All right, you know what?
You're on.

19:57.155 --> 19:58.489
This is your night.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.407
Thanks, man.
Good luck.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.618
Okay, that was awkward.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.788
Um, hey...

20:05.913 --> 20:08.041
Can we, maybe we should
get the band to start playing.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.959
There's no band.

20:10.084 --> 20:11.585
What?

20:11.711 --> 20:14.296
You said you were
handling the entertainment.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.509
I did.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.386
This is
a bachelor party, right?

20:29.478 --> 20:31.898
MADISON:
This lemonade is so yummers!

20:32.023 --> 20:32.982
Yes, it's yummerama.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.025
Give me, give me..
There you go.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.609
Ooh.
Sit, sit.

20:35.735 --> 20:36.569
Are you ready to sing?
Yeah.

20:36.694 --> 20:38.071
Okay, listen,
no love songs, please.

20:38.196 --> 20:39.405
If I have to hear...

20:39.530 --> 20:41.532
how in love she is
one more time,

20:41.657 --> 20:43.701
I'm going to impale
myself with a butter knife.

20:43.826 --> 20:45.369
You got it.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.454
Hey, okay, so it's
this one right here.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.040
All right.
Thanks.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.243
Who knew she
had it in her?

22:08.953 --> 22:10.079
I taped the whole thing.

22:10.204 --> 22:11.914
I think you found the hook
to your song.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.083
Thanks, guys.

22:14.208 --> 22:16.585
Adrianna, right?

22:16.710 --> 22:18.671
Yeah.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.881
You are...

22:21.007 --> 22:22.842
my new favorite singer!

22:22.967 --> 22:24.343
(laughs)

22:24.468 --> 22:26.595
You are uh-may-zing!
(squeals)

22:30.766 --> 22:31.851
Face it, Naomi,
she's an angel

22:31.976 --> 22:33.560
and she has no secrets.

22:33.686 --> 22:36.438
Well, then it's time
to give her one.

22:36.563 --> 22:38.941
MADISON:
Oh, my God.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.027
It's Nick Carter!
(shrieks)

22:42.444 --> 22:43.154
Oh, my God,
it's really him!

22:43.279 --> 22:44.530
I can't believe it!

22:49.994 --> 22:51.620
Nick Carter?

22:51.745 --> 22:52.788
Well, I take it

22:52.913 --> 22:55.333
you're the huge fan Naomi's
been telling me about.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.168
I can't believe
you're really here.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.294
Nick's an old friend.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.462
I wanted to give you
an early wedding present.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.422
Well, it's nice
to meet you.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.217
Naomi, this is
incredible of you.

23:04.342 --> 23:05.885
It's my pleasure!

23:06.010 --> 23:08.595
Hey, why don't you two
have some drinks,

23:08.721 --> 23:10.097
get to know
each other?

23:10.223 --> 23:12.516
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I am so sorry.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.391
Oh, man, that's
sticky as hell.

23:13.517 --> 23:15.561
You know what?
The waitstaff have

23:15.686 --> 23:16.394
extra shirts in
the storage room.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.522
Madison, why don't you
go help him?

23:20.941 --> 23:22.985
That was the fakest drink
spill I've ever seen.

23:23.110 --> 23:24.070
What are you up to?

23:24.195 --> 23:25.738
Okay, that little girl
is not as perfect

23:25.863 --> 23:26.947
as Max thinks she is.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.949
She's super wasted
right now,

23:29.075 --> 23:31.618
and judging
by my own experience

23:31.744 --> 23:33.453
when super wasted,

23:33.579 --> 23:35.289
if I put temptation
in her path,

23:35.413 --> 23:36.414
she will pounce on it.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.458
And what screams
temptation more than

23:38.584 --> 23:40.627
a Backstreet Boy
with his shirt off?

23:44.048 --> 23:46.342
Corner pocket.

23:46.466 --> 23:49.427
(sighs)
What the hell is wrong with me?!

23:49.553 --> 23:51.180
You suck at pool
almost as much

23:51.305 --> 23:52.765
as you suck at darts.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.392
What's next?

23:54.516 --> 23:57.603
You know what? Enough of these
kids' games, okay?

23:57.728 --> 23:59.230
If we're gonna have
a real contest,

23:59.355 --> 24:01.565
it's gonna involve booze.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.401
You really think you
can outdrink me?

24:03.525 --> 24:04.777
You realize I own this bar?

24:04.902 --> 24:07.363
Oh, I went to college.
For two months.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.407
Dude, I went to a bar
every Thursday

24:09.531 --> 24:10.241
after study group, okay?

24:10.366 --> 24:12.618
Now I'm gonna drink you

24:12.743 --> 24:13.827
under the table,
Princeton-style.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.413
Let's do this.

24:23.087 --> 24:24.588
Ivy, there you are.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.882
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.675
Uh, take this.
You need to go.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.511
But where, Annie?
What's at Pier 41?

24:31.637 --> 24:33.097
The Naomi.

24:33.222 --> 24:34.848
She gave PJ back the ring,
but she kept the boat.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.643
I thought it'd be the safest
place to send Diego.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.105
I actually do know
what it feels like

24:41.230 --> 24:43.565
to think that you ruined
someone else's life.

24:43.690 --> 24:45.025
But maybe this will help.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.236
You didn't get to say good-bye,
and now you can.

24:47.361 --> 24:50.030
Thank you, Annie.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.449
I mean, really, this is...

24:51.573 --> 24:53.575
No, don't thank me,
just go.
Right.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.791
Did I just see you
talking to Nick Carter?

25:00.916 --> 25:04.003
What is he doing here?
Is he going to sing, too?

25:04.128 --> 25:06.297
My guess is he's giving
a more private performance

25:06.422 --> 25:08.506
to one of his biggest fans
right about now.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.011
Gotcha!

25:12.136 --> 25:13.762
So after that,
Max started

25:13.887 --> 25:15.848
calling me "Bubbles,"
and then for my birthday,

25:15.973 --> 25:18.184
he got me these pajamas with
these little soap bubbles

25:18.309 --> 25:20.102
all over it...
Naomi! Hey!

25:20.227 --> 25:22.104
Look, I really wish
that I could hear

25:22.229 --> 25:23.689
the rest of this
excellent story,

25:23.814 --> 25:26.108
but see, I promised Naomi
that I'd help her with anything.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.567
Anything at all.

25:27.693 --> 25:31.197
Just, uh, it was nice
meeting you.

25:31.322 --> 25:32.572
Congrats again.

25:37.411 --> 25:41.207
The only thing you were doing
in here is talking about Max?

25:42.041 --> 25:44.668
Excuse us.

25:44.793 --> 25:45.627
Um...

25:47.463 --> 25:48.881
Okay, game over,
Sneaky Spice.

25:49.006 --> 25:50.341
What are you
talking about?

25:50.466 --> 25:51.800
You still have feelings
for Max, don't you?

25:51.925 --> 25:54.387
I mean, that's why you got
that poor girl drunk

25:54.512 --> 25:55.388
and tried to tempt
her with Nick Carter.

25:55.513 --> 25:57.848
No, no, no,
it's like I told you,

25:57.973 --> 25:59.266
I was trying
to protect Max.

25:59.392 --> 26:00.851
If she's capable
of cheating on him,

26:00.976 --> 26:02.520
he needs to know that
before he marries her.

26:02.644 --> 26:04.562
This is nothing wrong
with her, okay?

26:04.688 --> 26:06.940
She doesn't have
some deep, dark flaw.

26:07.066 --> 26:10.236
The only thing wrong with that
girl is that she's not you.

26:10.361 --> 26:12.321
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

26:12.446 --> 26:14.407
I know how hard it is
to get over someone.

26:14.532 --> 26:18.744
I mean, look at me, I'm still
writing music about Dixon.

26:18.869 --> 26:20.578
And, yeah, you can throw
yourself into your work,

26:20.704 --> 26:22.081
you can get engaged
to a billionaire,

26:22.206 --> 26:25.959
but you're still
in love with Max.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.337
You've always been
in love with Max.

26:28.462 --> 26:32.799
Okay, okay, I'm still
in love with Max.

26:32.925 --> 26:36.594
Then that's what he needs
to know before he marries her.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.604
It was nice meeting you.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.485
Hey.

26:51.609 --> 26:52.861
Oh, hello.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.154
Thanks for coming down.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.072
Yeah, of course.

26:55.197 --> 26:56.365
Why wouldn't I come?

26:56.490 --> 26:57.783
Well, I am

26:57.908 --> 27:00.286
the guy that burned down
your sorority house.

27:00.411 --> 27:03.456
Right. Well, accidents happen.

27:03.581 --> 27:06.083
Besides, I am so late
on my sorority dues,

27:06.208 --> 27:07.876
and I've got a trip
planned to Amsterdam

27:08.001 --> 27:09.169
with the girls
this summer.

27:10.463 --> 27:11.880
Got to get on that.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.382
Well, hey, uh...
(clears throat)

27:15.968 --> 27:18.095
If you're looking to
make a little extra,

27:18.220 --> 27:20.055
how much entertainment
does this buy?

27:20.180 --> 27:21.974
Austin!

27:22.099 --> 27:24.184
I don't... I don't know
what you've heard.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.562
I mean, I know there's a lot
of crazy rumors going around,

27:26.686 --> 27:29.898
but we are just here and paid
to have fun, look pretty,

27:30.023 --> 27:31.400
tell jokes.
Bree, hey.

27:31.525 --> 27:32.650
I'm a customer.

27:32.776 --> 27:33.527
Okay, why would I tell someone?

27:35.112 --> 27:38.574
Okay. Well, maybe
I can see if, um,

27:38.698 --> 27:41.327
one of the girls
might be interested in that.

27:41.452 --> 27:43.454
I don't want one of the girls.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.122
I want you.

27:45.247 --> 27:45.831
Really?

27:45.956 --> 27:47.749
Yeah.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.960
Listen, I've always had
kind of a thing for you.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.796
You know, but I'm not looking
for a long relationship.

27:52.921 --> 27:55.591
I just, uh, want to have
some fun, no strings attached.

27:57.510 --> 27:59.303
Okay.

27:59.428 --> 28:02.598
Maybe I could make an exception.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.392
There's a room in the back.

28:05.518 --> 28:06.477
Give me a minute.

28:06.602 --> 28:09.188
Okay. Yeah.
Let me get ready.

28:17.154 --> 28:19.823
I just wish we could sail away
and go live

28:19.948 --> 28:22.660
on a deserted island somewhere
or something.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.286
At least they won't be
looking for you

28:24.411 --> 28:25.621
in the middle of the ocean.

28:25.745 --> 28:27.206
We could catch our
dinner with a spear

28:27.331 --> 28:28.999
and start talking
to a volleyball

28:29.124 --> 28:30.584
like Tom Hanks
in Cast Away.

28:30.708 --> 28:31.960
Yeah, maybe no volleyballs.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.795
We'll have each other.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.214
It does feel like that's
all we need, huh?

28:35.339 --> 28:37.841
What if I came with you?

28:37.966 --> 28:39.426
No.

28:39.552 --> 28:40.511
Ivy, listen to me.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.388
If you miss your
therapy sessions,

28:42.513 --> 28:44.431
you'll get in
trouble, too.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.892
Maybe in, like,
a year or so,

28:47.017 --> 28:49.228
when all this blows over,
I can tell you where I am,

28:49.353 --> 28:50.604
but if they catch me,

28:50.729 --> 28:52.648
they're going to send
me back to Mexico.

28:52.814 --> 28:54.274
I haven't been there
since I was two.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.652
The U.S. is the only
home I've ever known.

28:56.776 --> 28:59.946
I cannot stand that this is
happening because of me, Diego.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.281
Because you did
something nice for me.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.659
Because you cared about me.

29:03.783 --> 29:04.660
Listen, it probably
would have been better

29:04.784 --> 29:07.120
for both of us
if I had just told you that.

29:08.997 --> 29:13.502
But at least Annie's given me
a chance to do it right.

29:17.047 --> 29:20.926
I love you, Ivy.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.597
I love you, too.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.070
What took you
so long?

29:40.195 --> 29:41.739
What's the rush?

29:41.863 --> 29:43.115
We've got all night.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.283
Aw.

29:44.408 --> 29:46.159
All night, huh?
Mm-hmm.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.620
What's that
going to cost me?

29:47.745 --> 29:51.873
A lady doesn't talk
dollars and cents, sir.

29:51.998 --> 29:53.833
Well, I'm not paying you
to be a lady.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.669
Come on, Bree,
this isn't my first barbecue.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.088
I like to know
what I'm getting up front.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.173
Okay.

30:02.676 --> 30:04.094
$5,000.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.971
$5,000. That's a
lot of money.

30:06.096 --> 30:08.890
Well, you won't
be disappointed.

30:09.015 --> 30:10.809
Oh.

30:22.738 --> 30:23.905
It's funny,

30:24.030 --> 30:26.366
you're so cute, I probably
would have done it for free.

30:39.004 --> 30:40.213
(banging on door)

30:40.339 --> 30:41.256
LAPD.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.049
We got a tip
that there is

30:43.175 --> 30:46.011
some illegal activity going
on here; you're under arrest.

30:46.136 --> 30:48.013
What?
You have the right
to remain silent.

30:48.138 --> 30:49.889
Anything you say

30:50.015 --> 30:51.308
can and will be held
against you...

30:57.981 --> 30:59.692
MAX:
Hey, guys.

30:59.817 --> 31:03.320
I think, uh, we've all had
plenty to drink tonight.

31:03.445 --> 31:04.780
Let's just call it a night, huh?

31:04.904 --> 31:06.156
You might as well give up;
you're not gonna win.

31:06.281 --> 31:07.907
You'd love that, huh?

31:08.033 --> 31:09.284
You...

31:09.409 --> 31:11.036
You think you're so much
better than me, huh?

31:12.746 --> 31:14.581
There's one thing that
you are not better at,

31:14.707 --> 31:17.042
and that's being
what Silver needs.

31:21.129 --> 31:23.590
You always got to be
the hero, don't you?

31:23.716 --> 31:25.175
You're drunk.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.219
Do you really
care about her?

31:27.344 --> 31:29.054
Or do you just want to be
with her so you can save her?

31:29.179 --> 31:31.056
That's what you
did with Annie

31:31.181 --> 31:32.641
and then that girl, Jane,

31:32.766 --> 31:34.768
and what's-her-face, Vanessa.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.770
(chuckles)
And now you're doing it again.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.439
But you know what, Liam?

31:39.565 --> 31:40.733
Those reviews,
they were right.

31:40.858 --> 31:43.276
You suck at being the hero

31:43.402 --> 31:44.570
in your stupid movie...

31:46.864 --> 31:48.866
...and in real life.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.412
(music playing, crowd cheering)

31:55.664 --> 31:57.750
You set me up.

31:57.875 --> 31:59.251
I thought
we were friends.

31:59.376 --> 32:00.544
Well, I think
that friendship ended

32:00.669 --> 32:01.795
when you tried to frame
Dixon for that fire.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.004
Payback's a bitch.

32:03.129 --> 32:04.339
Oh, yeah.

32:04.464 --> 32:06.132
Officer, you should know all
of those boys in there,

32:06.258 --> 32:09.969
they're all underage.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.722
Payback is a bitch.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.599
OFFICER:
Everyone, I'm gonna need
to see your IDs.

32:17.561 --> 32:19.730
Naomi, come quick;
Madison's drunk.

32:19.855 --> 32:20.606
She's trying
to set the fish free.

32:27.987 --> 32:30.699
It's not fair to keep you guys
cooped up like this.

32:30.824 --> 32:32.618
Uh-oh.

32:32.743 --> 32:33.619
OFFICER:
Put the bat down, ma'am.

32:33.744 --> 32:35.454
MADISON:
Okay, sharkies, I'm saving you!

32:41.334 --> 32:43.336
Sharkies!
Oh, my God.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.923
Swim free; the ocean's not far.

32:46.047 --> 32:47.549
You can make it.

32:54.180 --> 32:54.514
NAOMI:
She never would have done that

32:54.640 --> 32:55.808
if she hadn't had
six lemonades.

32:55.933 --> 32:57.058
Six?

32:57.183 --> 32:58.811
Give or take.

32:58.936 --> 33:00.646
(groans)

33:00.771 --> 33:01.772
Even drunk, she was
trying to do something nice.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.649
Yup.

33:03.774 --> 33:05.358
How can I tell Max
I still love him now?

33:05.484 --> 33:07.068
It makes me an even
more horrible person.

33:07.193 --> 33:10.614
Hey, I got your sweet,
innocent fiancée drunk

33:10.739 --> 33:12.115
and then arrested.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.827
Oh, but I still
have feelings for you.

33:14.952 --> 33:15.994
What's the point?

33:16.119 --> 33:17.913
I can't tell him. I...

33:18.037 --> 33:20.165
can't even look him in the eye.

33:23.084 --> 33:24.377
Max?

33:24.503 --> 33:25.587
Caleb?

33:29.633 --> 33:33.052
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Caleb Walsh.

33:33.178 --> 33:34.847
He came in with all the guys
from the bachelor party.

33:34.972 --> 33:36.807
He's 21, so we released him.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.934
Oh.

33:40.519 --> 33:41.645
Austin?

33:41.770 --> 33:44.147
What is going on?

33:44.272 --> 33:47.192
And why is Bree here?

33:47.317 --> 33:49.987
Because this stupid idiot got
me arrested for prostitution.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.530
She was gonna let me roast

33:51.655 --> 33:52.656
for that Kappa fire forever.

33:52.781 --> 33:54.115
I had to find some way
to make her pay.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.033
Well, I'm not the only one

33:55.158 --> 33:56.618
who's gonna pay.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.286
Annie is just as involved

33:58.411 --> 33:59.913
in this as I am.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.040
You're bringing me down, I'm
bringing her down with me.

34:06.795 --> 34:09.047
I'll make you a deal, Bree.

34:09.172 --> 34:11.925
You tell the cops
you started that fire,

34:12.050 --> 34:13.342
and I'll tell them that you
and I are dating,

34:13.467 --> 34:15.136
and I didn't pay you for sex.

34:15.261 --> 34:16.054
Why would I do that?

34:16.179 --> 34:18.056
'Cause you'd rather

34:18.181 --> 34:20.559
be known for this one mistake
than as the Madame of CU.

34:20.684 --> 34:22.518
That sort of thing follows you
around your whole life.

34:22.643 --> 34:23.478
Think about it.

34:23.603 --> 34:24.980
OFFICER:
I am taking you to booking.

34:25.103 --> 34:28.440
Ladies first.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.652
Come on.

34:31.777 --> 34:35.072
Officer, I have a confession
to make.

34:35.197 --> 34:37.074
It's about the Kappa fire.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.125
Austin,

34:46.251 --> 34:49.420
you really didn't need to
go through all of this.

34:49.545 --> 34:52.382
I mean, you could have
just told Ade the truth.

34:52.507 --> 34:54.175
Why do you keep protecting me?

34:54.300 --> 34:55.844
I guess it's because,

34:55.969 --> 34:58.430
uh, the thing you did
for Dixon,

34:58.555 --> 35:00.306
the thing
you're so ashamed of,

35:00.432 --> 35:02.434
you did out of love.

35:02.559 --> 35:04.102
I respect that.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.783
What happened to you guys?

35:20.577 --> 35:23.288
(sighs)
We had a drinking contest.

35:23.413 --> 35:24.623
What was the prize?

35:24.748 --> 35:26.207
Massive hangover?

35:26.332 --> 35:28.251
(sighs)

35:28.376 --> 35:30.796
It was you.

35:31.504 --> 35:33.840
Oh, you guys are unbelievable.

35:35.675 --> 35:38.136
This is my life.

35:38.261 --> 35:41.264
I'll be the one who decides
what happens in it, okay?

35:41.389 --> 35:42.808
And what's your decision?

35:42.933 --> 35:43.850
Yeah, come on, Silver.

35:43.976 --> 35:46.227
Just...

35:46.352 --> 35:48.438
neither of us are gonna
give up until you make a choice.

35:48.563 --> 35:51.149
Fine, want to know what I want?

35:51.274 --> 35:52.901
I want to have a baby.

35:53.026 --> 35:55.570
I want to be pregnant, and I
want to experience everything.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.614
And if I'm gonna do it,
I have to do it right now,

35:57.739 --> 36:00.533
so which one of you
is up for that?

36:06.414 --> 36:08.708
Yeah, that's what I thought.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.844
Austin, wait.

36:18.969 --> 36:20.261
Hey, what are you
still doing here?

36:20.386 --> 36:23.015
I heard Bree confessed
to the Kappa fire.

36:23.140 --> 36:24.516
It wasn't you.

36:24.641 --> 36:26.935
You were just trying
to cover for Dixon.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.561
Yeah, crazy stuff, huh?

36:30.647 --> 36:32.732
I'm really sorry
for all the things I said

36:32.858 --> 36:33.692
about not being able
to trust you

36:33.817 --> 36:35.861
and for you just being out
for yourself.

36:35.986 --> 36:37.696
It's cool.

36:37.821 --> 36:39.698
You know, I just, uh,

36:39.823 --> 36:42.659
want to get on with my life.

36:42.784 --> 36:45.745
Well, I might be able
to help you do that.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.164
(sighs)

36:47.288 --> 36:48.623
Will you please
be my manager again?

36:54.046 --> 36:55.505
I sang a song tonight

36:55.630 --> 36:58.175
that I'm pretty sure
is our first hit.

37:00.135 --> 37:01.970
Take a look.

37:04.222 --> 37:07.684
(footsteps approaching)

37:07.809 --> 37:10.687
Hey. I went looking
for you at the jail,

37:10.812 --> 37:12.689
but they said
that they released you.

37:12.814 --> 37:14.816
Hoped I'd find you here.

37:14.941 --> 37:16.609
Old habits die hard.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.487
When I feel bad, I come here.

37:19.612 --> 37:22.240
You were right about me.

37:22.365 --> 37:24.283
I-I started that charity

37:24.409 --> 37:27.453
because I just needed
to feel better

37:27.579 --> 37:30.123
'cause I couldn't
forgive myself.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.084
But I have now

37:32.209 --> 37:33.835
because what I did
for my brother,

37:33.960 --> 37:35.461
I did out of love.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.130
And that's a sign
of strength,

37:37.255 --> 37:38.840
not weakness.

37:38.965 --> 37:41.134
I'd do it all over again.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.385
Annie.

37:42.510 --> 37:43.720
Wait, Annie.

37:43.845 --> 37:44.470
Caleb,

37:44.596 --> 37:47.099
you have to forgive
yourself now

37:47.224 --> 37:49.726
because what we did,
we did out of love, too.

37:49.851 --> 37:53.354
And that doesn't make you weak
or unworthy.

37:53.479 --> 37:55.815
Can you honestly say
you wouldn't do it again?

37:55.941 --> 37:57.275
Hey,

37:57.400 --> 37:58.985
sorry, can we talk
to you guys?

37:59.111 --> 38:00.445
Uh, what's going on?

38:00.570 --> 38:02.363
Uh, we think
we figured out a way

38:02.488 --> 38:03.990
to buy Diego
a little bit more time.

38:04.116 --> 38:05.700
Police won't touch me if I
take sanctuary in a church.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.869
As long as I'm within the walls
of a holy place,

38:07.994 --> 38:09.370
I'm safe.

38:09.495 --> 38:12.373
So, come on, would you help us?

38:25.137 --> 38:27.222
They let you out.

38:27.346 --> 38:29.891
I posted everyone's bail,

38:30.016 --> 38:32.393
and, uh, we have to appear
in court.

38:32.518 --> 38:33.645
I think...

38:33.770 --> 38:36.148
Well, between us smelling
like a speakeasy

38:36.273 --> 38:40.152
and Madison smelling
like a fish hatchery,

38:40.277 --> 38:42.904
they probably just wanted us
out of there.

38:43.029 --> 38:46.532
Max, I'm sorry I let everything
get out of control tonight.

38:48.201 --> 38:50.162
It's not your fault.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.999
(sighs)

38:56.501 --> 38:58.336
Madison's a great girl.

38:58.461 --> 39:00.839
She's... great.

39:00.964 --> 39:02.423
Yeah.

39:02.548 --> 39:05.177
She...

39:05.302 --> 39:09.388
has pure intentions,

39:09.514 --> 39:12.225
a kind heart.

39:16.938 --> 39:19.398
I see why you're marrying her.

39:21.818 --> 39:22.568
When you know,
you know, right?

39:29.909 --> 39:32.120
I don't know.

39:32.912 --> 39:34.706
W-What?

39:34.831 --> 39:36.708
What if we're moving too fast?

39:39.252 --> 39:41.171
What do you think?

39:41.296 --> 39:42.881
I mean, you know me.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.302
You always did.

39:49.095 --> 39:51.223
Am I making a mistake?

39:53.683 --> 39:56.311
MADISON:
Oh, my God, I have never been
so embarrassed.

39:56.435 --> 39:58.521
Or so cold.

39:58.646 --> 40:00.398
Naomi, I am so sorry

40:00.523 --> 40:01.358
I went all fish commando.

40:01.524 --> 40:05.987
I swear,
I am never drinking again.

40:06.112 --> 40:09.282
Can we stop
on the way home?

40:09.407 --> 40:11.576
I have this weird craving
for chili cheese fries.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.040
Yeah, I'll get you
a big batch of them.

40:19.292 --> 40:21.086
Whoa.
Whoa.

40:30.345 --> 40:32.847
