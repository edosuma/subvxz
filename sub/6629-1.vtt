What, do you think,
this is funny?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.005
You think this is a joke?

give me a call, alright?

21:51.015 --> 21:54.005
It's so much better for Franklin
if he turns himself in.

21:54.007 --> 21:55.021
He stays out
on the street, Paula

21:55.023 --> 21:58.002
he's gonna get himself killed.

21:58.004 --> 22:00.021
Now, I'm trying
to protect him, I really am.

22:00.023 --> 22:02.003
This is my card.

22:04.018 --> 22:06.003
Will you give me a holler?

22:08.003 --> 22:09.009
Yeah, okay.

22:09.011 --> 22:10.020
Thank you.

22:20.017 --> 22:22.015
[engine idling]

22:26.004 --> 22:27.022
- Keep it running.
- Okay.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.013
- This might be quick.
- Alright.

22:34.011 --> 22:36.014
[instrumental music]

22:45.012 --> 22:46.015
White boy.

22:49.023 --> 22:51.013
[yells]

22:53.005 --> 22:54.010
[gasps]

22:54.012 --> 22:55.018
What the fuck was that for?

22:55.020 --> 22:57.019
That's for gettin' me
busted, goddamn it.

22:57.021 --> 22:59.011
Now, what you bring a gun
down here for?

22:59.013 --> 23:01.015
'Cause you're wanted
for murder, asshole.

23:01.017 --> 23:03.014
I ain't murdered
no-goddamn-body.

23:03.016 --> 23:05.010
- I don't know that.
- 'Well, now you know.'

23:05.012 --> 23:07.005
'Cause if I could,
I'd murder your ass right now.

23:07.007 --> 23:08.019
Coming out here
with a gun and shit.

23:08.021 --> 23:10.005
You know, guns don't
kill people.

23:10.007 --> 23:12.017
Stupid motherfuckers
with guns kill people.

23:12.019 --> 23:14.006
Oh, I'm enlightened.

23:14.008 --> 23:16.000
'Yeah.
Let me enlighten your ass.'

23:16.002 --> 23:17.021
'Bring your monkey ass
on up here.'

23:17.023 --> 23:19.020
Got me running
all over goddamn town.

23:19.022 --> 23:22.004
People shootin' at me
and shit.

23:22.006 --> 23:24.012
You're the one
got me in this shit.

23:24.014 --> 23:26.016
Oughta kick your ass
in the head.

23:28.022 --> 23:30.005
- Freezing.
- I know.

23:30.007 --> 23:31.019
I was in
the motherfucker earlier.

23:36.009 --> 23:37.023
Listen to me.

23:38.001 --> 23:40.017
- I want an exclusive.
- A what?

23:40.019 --> 23:42.020
Right now, the entire city
is looking for your ass.

23:42.022 --> 23:45.005
The cops want payback
for murdered cops.

23:45.007 --> 23:46.006
How many times
I gotta tell you

23:46.008 --> 23:47.016
I didn't kill
no-goddamn-body?

23:47.018 --> 23:49.023
Regardless, they want
your ass dead.

23:51.018 --> 23:53.013
Franklin, I will protect you.

23:53.015 --> 23:55.007
I'll get you turned in
safe and sound.

23:55.009 --> 23:56.022
Let you tell your side
of the story

23:57.000 --> 23:59.004
but I want the exclusive.

23:59.006 --> 24:01.003
I'll hide you for the weekend.

24:01.005 --> 24:03.021
It'll all be over on Monday.

24:03.023 --> 24:06.000
First of all, I don't trust
your ass and how the hell I know

24:06.002 --> 24:08.004
this exclusive shit
gonna clear my name?

24:08.006 --> 24:09.016
I guess you don't.

24:09.018 --> 24:12.017
But without me, you're probably
gonna end up dead.

24:12.019 --> 24:14.016
They need someone to blame,
and guess what

24:14.018 --> 24:16.011
right now, it's you.

24:19.002 --> 24:20.022
What do you say?

24:21.000 --> 24:22.023
(Franklin)
I ain't staying
in this neighborhood, man.

24:23.001 --> 24:24.010
I can't stay here
for no two days. I'm sorry.

24:24.012 --> 24:26.016
That's right. You can't
stay here for no two days.

24:26.018 --> 24:28.021
What you talkin' about?

24:28.023 --> 24:31.000
- You're coming to my wedding.
- Your wedding?

24:31.002 --> 24:33.020
Shit, hell, no.
I ain't going nowhere.

24:33.022 --> 24:36.008
Po-po looking for me, man.
Trying to kill me? Uh-uh.

24:36.010 --> 24:38.014
I'm staying on the low-low.

24:38.016 --> 24:41.013
Goddamn.
How you do that?

24:41.015 --> 24:44.000
Did a report once
on escape artists

24:44.002 --> 24:45.012
and the women who love them.

24:45.014 --> 24:47.006
Hey, man, teach me how
to do that shit real quick.

24:47.008 --> 24:51.004
- There's no time. Come on.
- Come on, dawg, we got time.

24:51.006 --> 24:53.008
I need you to take a shower..

24:54.012 --> 24:56.007
...shave the beard,
lose the earring

24:56.009 --> 24:58.021
and please do something
about that hair of yours.

24:58.023 --> 25:01.005
What are you talkin' about?
My 'do is tight.

25:01.007 --> 25:04.011
Well, every cop in the city
is looking for that tight 'do.

25:04.013 --> 25:06.007
Whatever, man,
look, I'll hook up the hair

25:06.009 --> 25:07.010
but I ain't touching
the earring

25:07.012 --> 25:08.022
'cause I'm still a player!

25:09.000 --> 25:11.021
That's fine.
I'm gonna make a phone call.

25:11.023 --> 25:14.007
I don't think there's any
hot water left.

25:14.009 --> 25:16.002
- What?
- 'You heard me.'

25:16.004 --> 25:18.013
What?
Punk-ass white boy.

25:18.015 --> 25:20.008
'This tub better be clean.'

25:20.010 --> 25:21.012
[door slams shut]

25:21.014 --> 25:24.000
[telephone ringing]

25:24.002 --> 25:26.018
- Yeah. Who is it?
- Hey, Barclay, it's James.

25:26.020 --> 25:28.018
How you doing?
Listen to me.

25:28.020 --> 25:30.019
I got Franklin Hatchett.

25:30.021 --> 25:32.019
Russell, don't play
games with me.

25:32.021 --> 25:34.012
Words like that
give me a stiffy

25:34.014 --> 25:36.018
and at my age,
I can't afford to waste them.

25:36.020 --> 25:38.016
I'm not kidding you,
he's at my place right now

25:38.018 --> 25:40.016
safe and sound
for the moment.

25:42.018 --> 25:44.023
Congratulations,
you're rehired.

25:45.001 --> 25:46.019
I thought I was supposed
to clear out my stuff by Monday.

25:46.021 --> 25:48.012
Didn't-didn't you say that?
You said that, right?

25:48.014 --> 25:50.003
No, but, Jimmy, darling,
you didn't really

25:50.005 --> 25:51.014
take me seriously, did you?

25:51.016 --> 25:54.006
You're Pulitzer material.
I've always said that.

25:55.017 --> 25:58.008
Look, I'll send a camera crew
down to, what is it?

25:58.010 --> 26:01.004
The 20th Precinct in,
say, an hour?

26:01.006 --> 26:02.011
Not a chance.

26:02.013 --> 26:04.004
I'm gonna keep him on ice
until Monday.

26:04.006 --> 26:05.007
For Sweeps Week.

26:05.009 --> 26:07.014
No, no, don't be foolish, Jimmy.

26:07.016 --> 26:09.020
A bird in the hand
is worth a ten-share

26:09.022 --> 26:11.017
for the whole weekend.

26:11.019 --> 26:13.021
Hey, Barclay, fuck you.

26:13.023 --> 26:15.016
'This is my story,
and you know it.'

26:15.018 --> 26:17.018
You're quite right.

26:17.020 --> 26:18.020
Monday it is.

26:18.022 --> 26:22.002
Ta-ta. Loser.

26:22.004 --> 26:23.016
Freeze!

26:23.018 --> 26:26.006
Freeze, now, get your goddamn
hands on the car!

26:26.008 --> 26:29.023
(male #5 on TV)
Vic Damone,
his music will last forever.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.020
Vic Damone..

26:31.022 --> 26:33.012
What the hell is a Vic Damone?

26:33.014 --> 26:35.014
(male #5)
Vic Damone's Greatest Hits.

26:35.016 --> 26:37.017
Ain't no goddamn greatest hit.
I ain't never heard it.

26:37.019 --> 26:39.016
(male #5)
He thrilled the world
when he married

26:39.018 --> 26:41.012
actress Diahann Carroll.

26:41.014 --> 26:42.016
Now he'll thrill you again.

26:42.018 --> 26:43.023
How the hell an Italian gonna

26:44.001 --> 26:45.016
get a fine-ass black woman
like that?

26:45.018 --> 26:47.015
(male #5)
The timeless hits of Vic Damone.

26:47.017 --> 26:50.014
"Vic Damone."
Shit, he can't sing.

26:50.016 --> 26:52.021
Only reason she married him
'cause he got money.

26:52.023 --> 26:55.005
Takin' all our sisters.

27:03.017 --> 27:04.022
I'm James Russell.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.015
Those stories along
with Andy Rooney

27:06.017 --> 27:09.017
tonight on 60 Minutes.

27:09.019 --> 27:12.006
[telephone ringing]

27:15.003 --> 27:16.009
- Hello?
- Honey?

27:16.011 --> 27:17.023
Sweetheart, I'm out the door.

27:18.001 --> 27:19.012
People are already showing up.

27:19.014 --> 27:22.009
I am so sorry. Something
really important came up.

27:22.011 --> 27:24.008
More important than
our rehearsal dinner?

27:24.010 --> 27:25.019
Of course not.
Of course not.

27:25.021 --> 27:28.023
And-and I'm-I'm, uh,
bringing somebody with me.

27:29.001 --> 27:30.001
Who?

27:30.003 --> 27:32.012
Old, dear friend of mine
from college.

27:32.014 --> 27:35.009
I-I, just kinda
ran into him today.

27:35.011 --> 27:37.004
Are you alright?
You sound funny.

27:37.006 --> 27:39.013
I'm perfect. Great.
I am excellent.

27:39.015 --> 27:41.011
I'll see you before
you know it. I love you.

27:41.013 --> 27:44.008
I love you, too.
Hurry up.

27:44.010 --> 27:45.015
Fuck me.

27:48.007 --> 27:49.016
Hey, Franklin,
I'm gonna start the car.

27:49.018 --> 27:51.008
'I'll meet you in
the courtyard, alright?'

27:51.010 --> 27:52.014
Kiss my ass!

27:52.016 --> 27:54.002
Find something in the closet
that fits.

27:54.004 --> 27:55.014
Now, move your ass.
We're late!

27:55.016 --> 27:56.018
(Franklin)
'And this towel wasn't clean'

27:56.020 --> 27:58.022
'you dirty-ass white boy!'

27:59.000 --> 28:00.020
[instrumental music]

28:03.012 --> 28:05.006
You had to pick that one,
didn't you?

28:05.008 --> 28:06.022
- This your ride, man?
- Yes.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.023
And that's my favorite
fuckin' suit you're wearing.

28:09.001 --> 28:11.009
I look good, don't I?

28:11.011 --> 28:12.017
Don't get mad at me
'cause I look better

28:12.019 --> 28:14.012
than you in your own shit.

28:14.014 --> 28:16.018
I should be
ebony man of the month.

28:16.020 --> 28:18.010
Is this something
to be proud of?

28:18.012 --> 28:21.002
You wouldn't know nothin'
about that with your goofy ass.

28:21.004 --> 28:24.014
You fuck up the suit
and we got a problem.

28:24.016 --> 28:26.022
Fuck the suit.
We already got a problem.

28:30.019 --> 28:34.003
(Franklin)
Goddamn! Look at this shit!

28:34.005 --> 28:36.012
James Russell,
you hustlin' son of a bitch.

28:36.014 --> 28:37.023
(James)
Yeah, look who's talking.

28:38.001 --> 28:39.018
At least, I've worked
for everything I have.

28:39.020 --> 28:41.005
(Franklin)
Yeah, you worked yourself
right into some

28:41.007 --> 28:42.022
rich pussy,
that's what you did.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.014
No wonder you don't give
a damn if I'm innocent.

28:44.016 --> 28:46.003
Your ass gonna get
married and retire.

28:46.005 --> 28:47.008
(James)
Let's get a couple
things straight

28:47.010 --> 28:49.003
about tonight's dinner, alright?

28:49.005 --> 28:51.015
You don't speak unless
spoken to. Not a word.

28:51.017 --> 28:53.010
You stay by my side.

28:53.012 --> 28:55.006
If you try anything
fucked up or funny

28:55.008 --> 28:57.019
I swear to God,
I will kill you myself.

28:57.021 --> 29:00.000
Just like you did
back on the docks?

29:00.017 --> 29:02.009
[laughs]

29:02.011 --> 29:03.013
I will beat your ass.

29:03.015 --> 29:05.012
You ain't beatin' shit, homes.

29:05.014 --> 29:07.012
I'll beat your ass.

29:09.021 --> 29:12.002
- Shit.
- Alright.

29:12.004 --> 29:13.008
We went to Stanford,
which is where?

29:13.010 --> 29:14.020
How the hell
I supposed to know?

29:14.022 --> 29:16.000
It's in the Bay Area

29:16.002 --> 29:18.007
where you graduated
with honors in '88.

29:18.009 --> 29:20.014
And your name,
your name tonight..

29:20.016 --> 29:22.020
...is Jonathan Smith.

29:22.022 --> 29:25.018
Hey, fuck the Jonathan Smith.
I'm me.

29:25.020 --> 29:27.011
One more thing.

29:27.013 --> 29:29.006
Do not say a word about
my fiance's weight.

29:29.008 --> 29:31.015
She's very sensitive
about that.

29:31.017 --> 29:33.010
Man, you must have
one of them fat-assed

29:33.012 --> 29:36.010
Taco Bell, McDonald-eatin',
big-booty-assed--

29:36.012 --> 29:38.004
- Jimmy!
- Mr. Cipriani.

29:38.006 --> 29:39.010
Hey, how are you?

29:39.012 --> 29:41.011
How many times I gotta
tell you? Call me dad.

29:41.013 --> 29:42.020
You're not getting
nervous, are you?

29:42.022 --> 29:45.017
- Who wouldn't be?
- Yeah, that's true. Who's this?

29:45.019 --> 29:47.017
This is a very good
friend of mine. This is--

29:47.019 --> 29:49.002
Vic Damone.

29:50.012 --> 29:53.019
- Junior.
- Oh, yeah.

29:53.021 --> 29:56.010
So he's Diahann Carroll's kid
and Vic Damone's kid.

29:56.012 --> 29:58.004
So you're half
and half Italian.

29:58.006 --> 30:00.013
Hey, paisan.

30:00.015 --> 30:04.011
Hey, me and your father?
Forget about it. Come here.

30:08.007 --> 30:10.005
Mamma mia!

30:10.007 --> 30:14.018
God, your house, <i>magnifico!</i>

30:14.020 --> 30:17.015
<i>Molto bella!</i>
Tutti-frutti!

30:17.017 --> 30:19.004
Where'd you learn
how to talk Italian?

30:19.006 --> 30:21.000
Vic talk to you in Italian
when you were a kid?

30:21.002 --> 30:22.001
All the time.

30:22.003 --> 30:23.015
Here she is!

30:23.017 --> 30:26.010
James, it's nice
of you to show up.

30:26.012 --> 30:28.020
Honey, I'm terribly sorry.

30:28.022 --> 30:32.004
My fiance Grace,
this is my friend Vic.

30:34.001 --> 30:35.003
You're phat.

30:37.004 --> 30:39.009
Phat. Damn!

30:40.020 --> 30:42.011
Phat.

30:42.013 --> 30:44.022
P-H-A-T.
"Pretty hot and tempting."

30:45.000 --> 30:46.009
'I'm stunned by your phatness.'

30:46.011 --> 30:48.005
James, you're a lucky man
to have

30:48.007 --> 30:50.011
such a phat-assed fiance, man.

30:50.013 --> 30:52.010
She fine.

30:52.012 --> 30:54.009
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.003
You made it.

30:58.005 --> 31:00.007
I thought you'd be off
covering that prison escape

31:00.009 --> 31:02.006
with the rest of the
low-life sensationalists.

31:02.008 --> 31:03.015
Mother, give it a rest.

31:03.017 --> 31:06.020
Actually, I am covering
that sort of indirectly, mom.

31:06.022 --> 31:08.020
[sighs]
How many times do I
have to tell you

31:08.022 --> 31:10.003
to call me Mrs. Cipriani?

31:10.005 --> 31:13.001
Connie, this is Vic Damone Jr.

31:13.003 --> 31:14.009
He's Jimmy's good friend.

31:14.011 --> 31:15.018
'Why don't you tell
us what it was like'

31:15.020 --> 31:17.007
growing up in that
show-biz atmosphere?

31:17.009 --> 31:18.013
Everybody's interested.

31:18.015 --> 31:20.007
Oh, well, you know,
I had a lot of friends.

31:20.009 --> 31:23.000
Junior Walker Jr.,
Sammy Davis Jr. Jr.

31:23.002 --> 31:25.011
Call me all the time,
we hang out all the time.

31:25.013 --> 31:28.020
And what do you do now,
Mr. Damone Jr.?

31:28.022 --> 31:31.006
- Uh, I'm in--
- Sales.

31:31.008 --> 31:32.023
- Retail?
- Seats.

31:33.001 --> 31:34.007
On the stock exchange.

31:34.009 --> 31:36.003
- Broker?
- Ticket scalper.

31:36.005 --> 31:37.013
But I can get you
anything you want

31:37.015 --> 31:38.021
if you let me know
ahead of time.

31:38.023 --> 31:42.006
- He's a funny guy.
- He's hysterical.

31:42.008 --> 31:44.003
Kills me.

31:44.005 --> 31:46.013
How about some nice
Dom Perignon '85?

31:46.015 --> 31:49.006
How about some Colt .45?

31:49.008 --> 31:51.019
[chuckling]

31:51.021 --> 31:53.023
Would you excuse me
for one second?

31:54.001 --> 31:55.009
I need to talk to you.

31:56.008 --> 31:57.014
What?

31:59.014 --> 32:00.014
What?

32:00.016 --> 32:02.003
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

32:02.005 --> 32:03.005
What do you think
I'm doing?

32:03.007 --> 32:05.020
I'm mingling
with the rich folks.

32:05.022 --> 32:07.007
I'm locking your ass
in the fucking

32:07.009 --> 32:08.012
closet for the rest
of the weekend.

32:08.014 --> 32:10.001
Look, man, don't even
start with me.

32:10.003 --> 32:11.022
You the one brought me out here
all in the middle of nowhere

32:12.000 --> 32:14.003
in Beverly Hills mingling
with these uppity-ass people.

32:14.005 --> 32:16.015
I'm wanted for murder and people
looking for me, my life's on--

32:16.017 --> 32:20.001
What about my life?
What about my life, huh?

32:20.003 --> 32:22.006
I'm lookin' at your life.

32:22.008 --> 32:26.017
Grace! Come here, girl.
What's up?

32:26.019 --> 32:29.017
This is beautiful.
This is beautiful.

32:29.019 --> 32:32.002
I couldn't be happier
for you and James.

32:32.004 --> 32:34.005
It's about time
he settled down

32:34.007 --> 32:35.022
after all the women
he been through.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.018
And those two twins
in school wasn't his.

32:37.020 --> 32:39.005
Mmph-mm.
That was all a lie.

32:39.007 --> 32:40.013
He had a lot of women.

32:40.015 --> 32:42.011
Matter of fact,
he had all the women but..

32:42.013 --> 32:46.003
All the women, all the guys,
I fucked them all.

32:46.005 --> 32:48.002
Here we go.

32:48.004 --> 32:50.002
I'd like to propose a toast,
if you don't mind.

32:50.004 --> 32:52.022
Ladies and gentlemen!

32:53.000 --> 32:55.013
Everybody!
Propose, propose a toast!

32:55.015 --> 32:58.009
Come on.
This is Vic Damone's son.

32:58.011 --> 33:00.007
[indistinct chatter]

33:01.014 --> 33:04.012
James, if you don't mind.

33:07.018 --> 33:10.002
Grace..

33:10.004 --> 33:11.016
...you're James' first

33:11.018 --> 33:13.003
his last

33:13.005 --> 33:15.001
his everything.

33:15.003 --> 33:17.021
'And you're the answer
to all his dreams.'

33:17.023 --> 33:22.017
'You're his sun, his moon,
his guiding star.'

33:22.019 --> 33:25.016
You're kinda wonderful,
that's what you are.

33:25.018 --> 33:28.018
'He knows there's
only one of you..'

33:28.020 --> 33:30.010
Isn't that Barry White?

33:30.012 --> 33:35.006
There's no way
he could have made two.

33:35.008 --> 33:37.018
You're all he's living for.

33:37.020 --> 33:41.014
Your love,
he'll keep for evermore.

33:41.016 --> 33:44.016
You're his first,
his last..

33:45.021 --> 33:47.013
...his everything.

33:48.017 --> 33:51.011
[all applaud]

33:58.001 --> 33:59.007
That was beautiful.

33:59.009 --> 34:01.018
I try to do what I can do
when I can do it.

34:03.009 --> 34:05.018
Congratulations.

34:07.021 --> 34:09.014
- You got a phone?
- Over there.

34:09.016 --> 34:10.018
Thank you.

34:12.005 --> 34:14.018
You can see
this kid is Italian.

34:14.021 --> 34:16.022
He feels deep.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.004
Deep.

34:29.016 --> 34:31.007
- Hello?
- 'Hello?'

34:31.009 --> 34:32.014
Hey, baby, what's up?
It's me.

34:32.016 --> 34:34.003
Oh, no, don't you
"Baby, it's me," me.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.010
I just saw your ass
on the news

34:35.012 --> 34:36.020
talking about you
killed some cop.

34:36.022 --> 34:38.014
- 'What?'
- 'I just saw you on the news--'

34:38.016 --> 34:40.007
(Franklin)
'Who told you that?'
I didn't kill nobody!

34:40.009 --> 34:42.016
- 'You killed some cop.'
- 'No. I didn't kill no cop.'

34:42.018 --> 34:44.007
(Paula)
'Once again, you are in trouble
for something!'

34:44.009 --> 34:46.009
- 'What did you do, anyway?'
- Don't yell at me.

34:46.011 --> 34:47.021
Don't yell at me.
You gonna let me talk?

34:47.023 --> 34:49.001
- Are you gonna let me talk?
- Alright. What?

34:49.003 --> 34:50.011
'Well, listen then, goddamn it!'

34:50.013 --> 34:52.016
Stop watching the goddamn news.
Somebody set me up.

34:52.018 --> 34:54.020
Well, where have you been
for the last 24 hours, okay?

34:54.022 --> 34:56.014
You better not be over
no girl's house!

34:56.016 --> 34:59.006
Hell, no, I ain't over
at no goddamn girl house!

34:59.008 --> 35:01.008
I'm wanted for murder. I ain't
got time to get no pussy!

35:01.010 --> 35:03.020
- What?
- I ain't fuckin' nobody.

35:03.022 --> 35:05.010
(Paula)
'Yeah, uh-huh.'

35:05.012 --> 35:07.008
What about this guy named
Carmine just called over here

35:07.010 --> 35:08.020
saying he's gonna kill us

35:08.022 --> 35:11.005
'if you don't give him
$25,000, Franklin?'

35:11.007 --> 35:14.017
What? I don't owe him
no goddamn $25,000!

35:14.019 --> 35:15.022
Okay, we got him.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.001
He's calling from
a 310 area code

35:17.003 --> 35:18.014
with a 274 prefix.

35:18.016 --> 35:20.006
What's he doing
in Beverly Hills?

35:20.008 --> 35:21.020
Look, just lock the doors
and don't answer the phone

35:21.022 --> 35:23.000
and get under the bed.

35:23.002 --> 35:24.015
I'm on my way, alright?
I'm on my way!

35:24.017 --> 35:26.007
(Paula on phone)
'Get under the..'

35:29.021 --> 35:32.014
Vic, you okay?
Somebody bothering you?

35:32.016 --> 35:34.004
No.
No, everything's cool.

35:34.006 --> 35:36.020
Frank Sinatra Jr.
got in trouble again.

35:36.022 --> 35:38.021
They got it down
to a one block-radius.

35:38.023 --> 35:41.001
He's on Roxbury

35:41.003 --> 35:43.011
between Sunset and Lexington.

35:43.013 --> 35:45.008
Right.
They're gonna check on it.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.015
Shit.

35:46.017 --> 35:48.000
Where the hell do you
think you're going, huh?

35:48.002 --> 35:49.017
I'm leaving, man. I'm out.

35:49.019 --> 35:51.001
You're out?

35:51.003 --> 35:52.015
Who'd you call, Franklin,
your partner?

35:52.017 --> 35:53.023
You called your partner,
didn't you?

35:54.001 --> 35:55.002
Partner? Man, what the hell
you talkin' about?

35:55.004 --> 35:56.009
Look, man, I called my girl.

35:56.011 --> 35:59.011
She pregnant and she need me
and I'm out.

35:59.013 --> 36:01.001
That is not part of our deal!

36:01.003 --> 36:02.018
Man, damn our deal.

36:02.020 --> 36:03.022
I ain't dealin'
my life away, man.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.004
Why you hustling me, huh?

36:05.006 --> 36:07.015
Why you won't
just turn me in, huh?

36:07.017 --> 36:09.002
What you waitin' on?

36:09.004 --> 36:10.002
I thought so.

36:10.004 --> 36:11.013
This bullshit.
You got me running--

36:11.015 --> 36:14.003
Look, I'm helping you.
You gotta help me, too.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.020
I need your story
live on Monday.

36:15.022 --> 36:17.010
It's Sweeps Week, man.

36:17.012 --> 36:19.008
Sweeps Week?
Man, fuck Sweeps Week!

36:19.010 --> 36:20.020
You got me out here,
I'm wanted for murder.

36:20.022 --> 36:23.003
You talkin' about
a goddamn broom and shit!

36:23.005 --> 36:24.006
Man, get me a taxi!

36:24.008 --> 36:26.009
[indistinct radio chatter]

36:31.009 --> 36:33.001
What is this
Sweeps Week thing again?

36:35.009 --> 36:37.016
But you didn't tell me
where you're going.

36:37.018 --> 36:39.002
Please, Grace,
you have to trust me.

36:39.004 --> 36:40.013
I'm onto something big.

36:40.015 --> 36:41.022
What am I gonna tell everybody?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.002
You'll think of something.

36:43.004 --> 36:44.005
I'll be back first thing
in the morning.

36:44.007 --> 36:46.002
And I swear.

36:46.004 --> 36:48.000
- James..
- I love you.

36:52.012 --> 36:53.016
I know.

36:56.002 --> 36:57.006
You better not be
lying to me.

36:57.008 --> 36:59.010
What the hell I gotta
lie to you for?

36:59.012 --> 37:01.006
I happen to know
how your type operates.

37:01.008 --> 37:02.011
- My type?
- Yeah.

37:02.013 --> 37:03.018
So why the hell
you take my type to your

37:03.020 --> 37:05.023
goddamn dinner rehearsal
for a damn story?

37:06.001 --> 37:07.022
- I'm stuck with you.
- You ain't stuck with shit.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.023
- I figured your white ass out.
- Oh, you have, have you?

37:10.001 --> 37:11.018
Yeah.
You're full of shit.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.001
You one desperate-ass
middle-class white boy

37:14.003 --> 37:16.011
that don't give a damn who you
step on to get what you want.

37:16.013 --> 37:18.017
That's what you are. You need
to get your priorities straight.

37:18.019 --> 37:20.022
- My priorities?
- Your goddamn priorities.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.004
I'm not the one wanted
for murder, remember?

37:23.006 --> 37:24.019
Look, man, I'm sick
of your smart-ass comments.

37:24.021 --> 37:26.013
You know I ain't murdered
no-goddamn-body.

37:26.015 --> 37:28.015
You the reason why I'm in this
shit in the first place.

37:28.017 --> 37:31.003
I was down there minding
my own goddamn business

37:31.005 --> 37:32.008
living ghetto fabulous.

37:32.010 --> 37:33.011
I wasn't messin' with nobody.

37:33.013 --> 37:34.018
You came and fucked that up.

37:34.020 --> 37:35.023
'You know how much money
I was making down'

37:36.001 --> 37:37.003
'at that goddamn car wash, huh?'

37:37.005 --> 37:38.012
A buck, buck 2.98?

37:38.014 --> 37:40.008
I will slap you, man.
I will slap the hell outta you.

37:40.010 --> 37:42.016
You don't play with me. You
don't know who you messin' with.

37:42.018 --> 37:44.002
I don't even know when
I'm gonna slap somebody.

37:44.004 --> 37:45.016
My reflexes just slap people.

37:45.018 --> 37:47.012
I be like, "Damn!
Why did I do that?"

37:47.014 --> 37:48.021
I don't know when I be
slappin' people.

37:48.023 --> 37:50.008
I don't know when I be
slappin' somebody.

37:50.010 --> 37:51.018
You keep messin' with me.
I'm dangerous.

37:51.020 --> 37:53.007
I'm scared of myself.

37:53.009 --> 37:55.002
They call me "Snap and pop"
cause I snap

37:55.004 --> 37:56.015
'and I will pop your ass
in the mouth.

37:56.017 --> 37:58.016
'Don't mess with me, man.
Better watch your back.'

37:58.018 --> 37:59.023
Watch your goddamn back.

38:00.001 --> 38:02.009
Even in the shower,
eatin' at picnics

38:02.011 --> 38:03.019
you better watch
your goddamn back.

38:03.021 --> 38:04.020
Make a right.

38:04.022 --> 38:07.012
[instrumental music]

38:09.015 --> 38:11.012
There's my crib right there.

38:11.014 --> 38:13.016
And there goes your
stakeout right there.

38:13.018 --> 38:15.009
Shit!
Quick. Turn.

38:15.011 --> 38:16.023
Turn-turn down here.
I know a shortcut.

38:19.020 --> 38:22.009
[music continues]

38:23.023 --> 38:26.012
Alright. Ohh!

38:26.014 --> 38:27.020
She just turned
the lights out.

38:27.022 --> 38:28.022
You're up, sport.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.023
[sighs]

38:46.005 --> 38:47.012
Shit!

38:47.014 --> 38:49.001
Girl, what the hell
is wrong with you? It's me!

38:49.003 --> 38:50.001
Don't you take that tone
with me

38:50.003 --> 38:51.016
Franklin Maurice Hatchett, okay?

38:51.018 --> 38:54.007
See, I should just really crack
your thick-ass skull right now.

38:54.009 --> 38:56.007
- What you talking about?
- Leaving me here all alone.

38:56.009 --> 38:58.005
Is this the kind of father
that you're gonna be?

38:58.007 --> 39:00.014
No, tell me right now, okay?
I'll move back to Riverside.

39:00.016 --> 39:02.017
- Don't think that I won't.
- Would you calm down?

39:02.019 --> 39:05.001
What's up with the hair
and that suit?

39:05.003 --> 39:07.015
I mean, you look like you
just stepped out of a casket!

39:07.017 --> 39:10.005
Calm down!

39:10.007 --> 39:12.007
Now, you know I ain't killed
nobody. What you talk..

39:12.009 --> 39:14.007
It's me, baby. It's me.

39:14.009 --> 39:17.006
Come on, now.
You know I need you.

39:17.008 --> 39:19.018
Why you think I came
over here so fast?

39:19.020 --> 39:21.016
- I'm worried about you now.
- Alright.

39:21.018 --> 39:23.017
- I'm sorry, okay?
- Yeah.

39:23.019 --> 39:26.021
You know I love you.
I'm sorry, okay?

39:30.000 --> 39:31.005
[horn honks]

39:34.016 --> 39:35.020
She just turned
the lights back on.

39:35.022 --> 39:37.005
Huh? Huh?

39:37.007 --> 39:38.013
Bingo. Let's go.

39:39.013 --> 39:40.023
Okay, but who is this?

39:41.001 --> 39:43.000

- That's..

39:43.002 --> 39:44.013
James Russell,
Channel 12 News.

39:44.015 --> 39:46.008
The weatherman?
What are you doing with him?

39:46.010 --> 39:47.017
That's-that's just
my white friend.

39:47.019 --> 39:49.012
He gonna help me
get out of this mess.

39:49.014 --> 39:51.022
Okay, but what about Carmine
and the money that you owe him?

39:52.000 --> 39:53.003
- What about all that?
- Don't worry about that.

39:53.005 --> 39:54.006
'Cause he lyin',
I do not owe him

39:54.008 --> 39:55.019
no 25,000 goddamn dollars.

39:55.021 --> 39:57.015
I owe him $7,000.
He added on interest.

39:57.017 --> 39:59.001
He lyin', baby.
He lyin'.

39:59.003 --> 40:00.014

40:00.016 --> 40:02.015
Alright, alright, alright.
Calm down.

40:02.017 --> 40:05.021
Don't worry about it, okay?
Alright? How you doin'?

40:05.023 --> 40:07.007

- Uh, he fine.

40:09.003 --> 40:10.018

40:10.020 --> 40:12.018
You ain't worried about

40:12.020 --> 40:16.004
My baby come out with two toes,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

40:16.006 --> 40:18.001
You've had the sonogram,
I assume.

40:18.003 --> 40:19.003
- What?
- What?

40:19.005 --> 40:20.006
Sonogram?

40:20.008 --> 40:21.012
Did a three-part expose
a few years back

40:21.014 --> 40:23.000
on prenatal healthcare.

40:23.002 --> 40:24.004
We discovered that not only..

40:24.006 --> 40:25.005
[pounding on door]

40:25.007 --> 40:26.018
Police. Open the door.

40:26.020 --> 40:28.013
'We know you're in there,
Hatchett.'

40:28.015 --> 40:29.023
- In a minute!

40:33.013 --> 40:35.000

40:35.002 --> 40:36.016
Oh, come on, just give me

40:36.018 --> 40:39.002
Open this fucking door

40:39.004 --> 40:40.011
Anything go wrong,

40:48.008 --> 40:49.023
- Police!
- Hey, hey wait a minute!

40:50.001 --> 40:52.012
Do you guys have a warrant?
I mean, what do you guys want?

40:52.014 --> 40:53.022
We want your boyfriend,
that's what.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.017
- Why--
- Window! Window!

40:55.019 --> 40:56.021
You know,

41:31.018 --> 41:34.011
What the hell
are you shootin' at?

41:34.013 --> 41:36.007
He's a cop killer,
Officer Pickett!

41:36.009 --> 41:38.004
Don't be trying to kill
everybody, will you?

41:38.006 --> 41:40.013
Oh, for Christ's sake!

41:43.001 --> 41:44.008
(Franklin)
Right here. Right here.
This is it.

41:44.010 --> 41:46.003
This is it, turn-turn here.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.023
All you've been doing
is bitchin' and bitchin'

41:52.001 --> 41:54.002
and bitchin'
ever since we got together.

41:54.004 --> 41:55.012
Yeah, so I'm bitching.
So what?

41:55.014 --> 41:56.023
I'm not used to getting
shot at, alright.

41:57.001 --> 41:58.010
Well, I'm not used to people
getting me into shit

41:58.012 --> 41:59.018
so shut the hell up.

41:59.020 --> 42:01.015
Now, that French dude
who killed those cops

42:01.017 --> 42:03.007
had a stamp on his hand
from this club.

42:03.009 --> 42:04.020
'Now, I heard a lot of
Euro trash hang out down here.'

42:04.022 --> 42:06.006
'Now, we're gonna go in here.'

42:06.008 --> 42:07.014
'If we see him,
we're gonna call the cops'

42:07.016 --> 42:08.022
'get them down here,
get him busted'

42:09.000 --> 42:10.017
'and clear my goddamn
name tonight.'

42:14.003 --> 42:16.023
Can I-can I handle this?

42:18.020 --> 42:19.023
[knocking on door]

42:22.014 --> 42:25.000
Good evening. James Russell,
Channel 12 News.

42:25.002 --> 42:26.019
We're doing a report
on local nightclubs in the area.

42:26.021 --> 42:28.007
'I'd like to ask you
a few questions.'

42:28.009 --> 42:31.020
Oh, you're

Get the fuck out of here.

42:40.013 --> 42:42.003
[laughing]

42:45.012 --> 42:46.020
Whoo, damn.

42:46.022 --> 42:49.020
You got a lot of pull
in this town.

42:49.022 --> 42:51.015
I could do a report
on this shithole

42:51.017 --> 42:53.007
that'd close it down forever.

42:53.009 --> 42:55.009
[chuckles]
Fuck that, man.

42:55.011 --> 42:56.011
If we can't go
to the Red Camel

42:56.013 --> 42:57.019
Red Camel comes to us.

42:57.021 --> 42:59.007
- Come on.
- What are you talking about?

42:59.009 --> 43:01.019
Just come on.

43:01.021 --> 43:05.002
- Where are you going?
- Come on. Shut the hell up.

43:05.004 --> 43:07.000
Bring your ass on.

43:09.010 --> 43:11.016
Give me a quarter.

43:11.018 --> 43:13.016
Hey, hurry up

43:23.009 --> 43:25.006
Who are you calling?

43:26.012 --> 43:27.016

43:39.006 --> 43:40.023
Get your ass out..

43:41.001 --> 43:44.007
Fuck you! Fuck you!

43:44.009 --> 43:46.001
There's a goddamn bomb
in the building

43:46.003 --> 43:47.008
and it soon will blow!

43:47.010 --> 43:50.019
You better get your ass

43:50.021 --> 43:53.001
You have crossed the fucking--

43:53.003 --> 43:55.020
Watch this, watch this.

Run already! Run!

44:14.019 --> 44:16.001
That's him, that's him

44:16.003 --> 44:17.005
That's one of them
right there.

44:17.007 --> 44:19.005
- 'You sure?'
- 'I'm sure.'

44:20.016 --> 44:22.005
'Damn, that bitch fine.'

44:23.007 --> 44:24.012
'Wait a minute.'

44:27.009 --> 44:29.001

Now, look, when we get in here,
you don't say nothin'.

47:26.023 --> 47:28.012
Only two white people
done walked in here.

47:28.014 --> 47:30.022
You keep your mouth shut, you'll
be the first one to walk out.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.010
Oh, and another thing.
You ain't white, you mixed.

47:34.012 --> 47:38.008

47:48.005 --> 47:49.018

47:51.012 --> 47:54.003
No. Aaron don't know

47:54.005 --> 47:55.007
Hey, how the hell
you know, man?

47:55.009 --> 47:57.005
Look, tell him I was there
when he shot

47:57.007 --> 47:58.013
baby bro at McArthur Park.

47:58.015 --> 47:59.022
Where'd he shoot baby bro?

48:00.000 --> 48:01.006
At McArthur Park,
you big dumb--

48:01.008 --> 48:03.015
No! Where'd he shoot him?

48:03.017 --> 48:06.012
In the ass! Everybody know
he got shot in the ass!

48:08.007 --> 48:10.000
Don't ever play me

48:10.002 --> 48:12.009
I am sorry.
I was just playin'.

48:12.011 --> 48:14.013

What's popping?

48:24.005 --> 48:25.007
What's up, Franklin?

48:25.009 --> 48:26.014
Hey, man,
I tried calling you

48:26.016 --> 48:28.009
but the phone,
couldn't get through.

48:28.011 --> 48:29.018
But anyway,
I need your help, man.

48:29.020 --> 48:32.004
I need some, uh,
gats on credit.

48:32.006 --> 48:33.019
- Again?
- Again?

48:33.021 --> 48:35.017
Oh, last time, you know
that wasn't my mistake.

48:35.019 --> 48:37.007
That was little Johnny
who fucked up the money.

48:37.009 --> 48:41.012
Yeah, you know little Johnny
is invisible Johnny now, right?

48:41.014 --> 48:42.013
Yeah, I know.
I went to the funeral.

48:42.015 --> 48:43.016
That was fucked up what you did.

48:43.018 --> 48:45.002
It was closed casket
and everything.

48:45.004 --> 48:49.021
But anyway, I appreciate
this if you do this, man.

48:49.023 --> 48:51.019

- Reporter?

49:10.014 --> 49:12.016
Aa-ron!
Hold on, man. What the hell!

49:22.009 --> 49:23.021

49:23.023 --> 49:25.016
Look, he don't know nothin'
about you. He here for me.

49:25.018 --> 49:27.005
He don't know nothin'
about the hoes and the guns

49:27.007 --> 49:29.005
and the drugs.
Aaron, Aaron, Aaron!

49:29.007 --> 49:30.013
'Man, you know
I won't bring no shit'

49:30.015 --> 49:32.003
down on you like that,
look at me now.

49:32.005 --> 49:34.009
How far we go back?

49:34.011 --> 49:36.006
Elementary.

49:36.008 --> 49:38.013
Jump rope?

49:38.015 --> 49:40.019
Hide and go seek?

49:40.021 --> 49:43.005
Pitty pat?

49:43.007 --> 49:45.013
Red light, green light?

49:45.015 --> 49:47.005
Red light, green light.

49:47.007 --> 49:50.000
'Now, what would our mamas
say to see us like this?'

49:50.002 --> 49:53.001
All the stuff we done
been through?

49:53.003 --> 49:55.000
'Oh, we boys, man.'

49:55.002 --> 49:57.011
- Yeah.
- Cool?

50:01.011 --> 50:02.021
(Aaron)
'Come with me, Frank.'

50:07.020 --> 50:09.022
[instrumental music]

50:12.016 --> 50:14.017
So you say
you got problems, huh?

50:14.019 --> 50:16.010
Damn.

50:17.020 --> 50:19.018
Itty-bitty,
teeny-weeny problems.

50:19.020 --> 50:21.013
[gun clicks]

50:21.015 --> 50:24.001
Big fat-ass problems.

50:26.001 --> 50:27.013
I got what you need.

50:28.021 --> 50:31.022
Now, there's no itch
that a..

50:32.000 --> 50:35.006
...HK MP5 can't scratch.

50:36.012 --> 50:39.011
Unless, of course, you want a..

50:39.013 --> 50:41.003
'...Uzi'

50:41.005 --> 50:43.010
with a Wilson suppresser on it.

50:44.008 --> 50:46.005
Very nice.

50:46.007 --> 50:48.011
Very...urban.

50:49.014 --> 50:50.021
I'd go with
the Heckler & Koch.

50:52.015 --> 50:54.023
Well, it's got a closed bolt
as opposed to the Uzi.

50:55.001 --> 50:56.003
It's got a faster cyclic rate

50:56.005 --> 50:57.012
better sights, rear aperture.

50:57.014 --> 51:00.015
It's German
as opposed to Israeli.

51:00.017 --> 51:01.020
It's much more accurate than--

51:01.022 --> 51:03.021
You're damn right.

51:05.013 --> 51:07.017
You sure you not a fucking cop?
