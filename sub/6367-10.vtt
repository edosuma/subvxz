00:40.928 --> 00:44.056
Please, you have to tell him.

00:44.332 --> 00:47.130
I would never steal from him.

00:47.335 --> 00:48.335
Please.

00:49.737 --> 00:51.432
You can tell him yourself.

01:08.856 --> 01:10.790
Please, Mr. Rabbit.

01:10.991 --> 01:13.118
- Please.
- Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

01:16.430 --> 01:17.988
Did you steal from me, Yuri?

01:18.199 --> 01:20.292
No. Please. Let me explain.

01:20.501 --> 01:23.664
Did you steal from me?

01:36.150 --> 01:37.549
Yes.

01:44.392 --> 01:45.984
Thank you.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.421
Why?

01:47.628 --> 01:49.619
For being honest with me.

01:49.830 --> 01:52.298
Now we can talk like men again.

03:30.664 --> 03:31.892
- Budmo.
- Hey!

03:32.099 --> 03:33.157
- Budmo!
- Hey!

03:33.367 --> 03:35.267
- Budmo!
- Hey!

03:36.804 --> 03:37.804
Mmm.

03:39.240 --> 03:41.606
And I toast the two of you.

03:41.809 --> 03:44.801
The truck job
was brilliantly executed.

03:45.012 --> 03:47.572
Tell me, how did you get
your false credentials for that job?

03:47.781 --> 03:49.248
The background check
should have taken six months.

03:49.450 --> 03:50.974
Yeah, I know a guy.

03:51.185 --> 03:53.119
It sounds like
we should all know this guy.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.685
- Yeah.
- He doesn't like crowds.

03:54.922 --> 03:55.922
Leave him, Olek.

03:56.090 --> 03:58.422
Where would we be
without our secrets?

03:59.426 --> 04:01.690
- Budmo.
- Hey.

04:03.631 --> 04:06.759
So, you've had a very good year.

04:06.967 --> 04:08.298
One last job next week

04:08.502 --> 04:10.129
and then we go
quiet for a while, yes?

04:11.639 --> 04:14.039
What? What?

04:14.241 --> 04:16.000
That's what someone
always says in the movies

04:16.176 --> 04:17.438
- right before they get caught.
- Stop it.

04:17.644 --> 04:18.873
- I'm just saying.
- Well, don't say.

04:19.079 --> 04:21.445
- Well, you know.
- You watch too many movies.

04:21.682 --> 04:23.775
Why don't you
watch some with me?

04:23.984 --> 04:25.508
Learn some English.
Get rid of some of that accent.

04:25.719 --> 04:27.846
- It's part of my charm.
- Is that what you call it?

04:28.055 --> 04:30.888
Daddy, what's this last job?

04:31.091 --> 04:33.059
Capital Diamond.

04:35.329 --> 04:37.763
- Seriously?
- We've been down this road.

04:37.965 --> 04:40.456
I know, but I have
some new information.

04:41.802 --> 04:43.167
One package,

04:43.370 --> 04:45.201
10 million in loose stones.

04:45.406 --> 04:46.726
Listen, that place is a fortress.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.866
- The electronics alone...
- Yes, but luckily, you know a guy.

04:50.945 --> 04:51.969
Right?

04:53.380 --> 04:55.211
Well, I am wiped.

04:55.583 --> 04:56.583
I'm gonna go home.

04:56.784 --> 04:58.411
Olek will drive you.

05:00.454 --> 05:03.855
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Anastasia.

05:08.495 --> 05:09.894
Night.

05:18.973 --> 05:20.964
- Thanks.
- So?

05:21.175 --> 05:23.234
- What?
- I know when you're troubled.

05:25.946 --> 05:28.414
Look, Capital Diamond,
it's high risk.

05:28.716 --> 05:31.617
Yes. Are you worried?

05:34.989 --> 05:37.822
I don't know yet.
Just let me do some recon.

05:39.927 --> 05:41.519
You listen to me.

05:41.695 --> 05:44.596
Every time you and Ana
go out on a job,

05:44.765 --> 05:48.292
I'm trusting you
with my daughter's life.

05:48.469 --> 05:50.369
I could never do that

05:50.537 --> 05:53.267
if I didn't see you as a son.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.203
Do you understand?

05:58.045 --> 06:00.206
You do your research.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.574
You consider the risk.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.010
You decide.

06:13.060 --> 06:15.085
Have a good night.

06:15.295 --> 06:16.922
You look very beautiful tonight.

06:19.333 --> 06:20.527
Thank you.

06:20.768 --> 06:23.100
Why don't I come in
for one more drink?

06:26.607 --> 06:28.268
It's been such a long night.

06:28.442 --> 06:31.309
I can barely keep my eyes open.

06:31.779 --> 06:33.007
Another time.

06:33.147 --> 06:34.375
Sure.

06:34.548 --> 06:35.981
Thanks for the lift.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.512
Good night.

06:57.771 --> 06:59.636
I need to get a better lock.

07:00.808 --> 07:02.673
I'd just come through the window.

07:35.008 --> 07:36.008
What?

07:36.176 --> 07:37.370
You know what.

07:38.278 --> 07:40.508
We said it had to be the big one.

07:41.148 --> 07:43.378
10 million in loose stones,
that's pretty big.

07:44.585 --> 07:46.746
No one's ever stolen
from Rabbit before and lived.

07:46.954 --> 07:48.512
We could do this.

07:49.156 --> 07:51.420
- He'll kill you.
- No, he won't.

07:51.692 --> 07:53.319
He won't. By the time Rabbit

07:53.494 --> 07:55.254
realizes what's going on,
we'll be long gone.

07:55.395 --> 07:57.454
- He'll find us.
- No, he won't.

07:59.133 --> 08:00.464
I have it handled.

08:02.469 --> 08:04.061
You have it handled?

08:04.471 --> 08:05.733
Yeah.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.702
You have to be a little
more specific than that.

08:13.247 --> 08:15.215
You know what? You're right.

08:18.051 --> 08:20.212
- I think you're ready.
- Ready for what?

08:20.621 --> 08:22.680
Not what, who.

08:23.123 --> 08:24.488
Who?

08:26.593 --> 08:27.161
Who?

08:27.161 --> 08:28.161
Who?

08:28.195 --> 08:29.890
Whoo! Go, girl.

08:45.412 --> 08:47.312
You take me to
the nicest places.

09:25.619 --> 09:26.643
Nice shoes.

09:26.820 --> 09:28.287
Did your daddy buy those for you

09:28.455 --> 09:30.946
before or after he sodomized you?

09:31.091 --> 09:32.285
What did he say?

09:35.095 --> 09:36.255
That was nasty.

09:39.833 --> 09:42.393
I'm sorry,
I couldn't hear you over the music.

09:42.769 --> 09:44.031
What was that you were saying?

09:44.171 --> 09:45.763
I said your daddy ass raped you.

09:47.941 --> 09:50.671
No, no, no.
This here's a place

09:50.878 --> 09:53.938
where we all can come
to express ourselves freely.

09:54.248 --> 09:55.909
Lord knows I do.

09:56.149 --> 09:58.413
These gentlemen here
have every bit as much right

09:58.619 --> 10:01.144
to express themselves as any of us.

10:01.421 --> 10:02.718
I applaud you gentlemen.

10:02.890 --> 10:04.551
Coming here was an act
of great courage.

10:05.092 --> 10:06.423
At this stage in your lives

10:06.660 --> 10:09.356
when you're struggling
with your homosexuality.

10:10.063 --> 10:11.394
Still buying each other rounds,

10:11.565 --> 10:13.726
hoping one of you gets drunk enough
to suck the other one's dick

10:13.901 --> 10:16.597
and then pretend to
forget about it in the morning.

10:16.970 --> 10:18.494
Let's hear it
for our new gay friends,

10:18.705 --> 10:20.036
ladies and gentlemen.

10:20.274 --> 10:21.536
Let's give them a hand.

10:23.443 --> 10:24.842
I am gonna fuck you up!

10:25.112 --> 10:26.739
Baby, you ain't my type.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.088
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

10:35.789 --> 10:37.416
I'll be here all week.

10:40.127 --> 10:41.127
Let's go.

10:45.999 --> 10:47.694
Hey, Job. How you doing?

10:47.901 --> 10:50.893
Another night,
another drunk bigot to emasculate.

10:51.171 --> 10:52.331
You almost made it
through the whole song.

10:52.773 --> 10:53.773
You're getting better.

10:53.941 --> 10:55.272
- Fuck you.
- You, too.

10:57.077 --> 10:58.077
So this is her?

10:58.278 --> 11:00.337
Job, Ana.
Ana, Job.

11:00.948 --> 11:02.210
Hello.

11:04.618 --> 11:06.916
Honey, you're much too hot
to be shopping retail.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.920
That dress means well,
but it's cut all wrong.

11:08.922 --> 11:11.203
Thanks, but I don't know
if we're going for the same look.

11:11.425 --> 11:12.653
Style is style, honey.

11:12.859 --> 11:15.692
You either got it
or you just think you do.

11:17.798 --> 11:20.232
Come on,
I'll give you the nickel tour.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.458
Place looks great.

11:21.601 --> 11:23.034
The place is an abortion.

11:23.203 --> 11:24.966
Sometimes I think I'm just
gonna gut the whole thing

11:25.172 --> 11:26.730
and open a hair salon.

11:26.907 --> 11:27.907
You cut hair?

11:27.908 --> 11:30.308
Baby, I've hacked the CIA,
the FBI, and the World Bank.

11:30.477 --> 11:32.206
I think I can probably cut some hair.

11:32.346 --> 11:33.626
How we doing on the diamond job?

11:34.081 --> 11:36.606
- It'll be ready when you are.
- And the other thing?

11:40.087 --> 11:42.078
You'll be Carrie and Tom Palmer.

11:42.289 --> 11:44.382
Licenses, credit cards,
checking accounts.

11:44.591 --> 11:46.491
I've already leased you
matching Hondas.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.318
You're both boring as shit.

11:48.595 --> 11:51.155
Carrie.
That'll take some getting used to.

11:51.498 --> 11:53.193
Well, then you'd best get started.

11:53.934 --> 11:56.630
'Cause, girl,
I am not doing it again.

12:12.619 --> 12:13.677
Can I help you, Agent?

12:16.156 --> 12:17.282
Now how can you tell?

12:18.625 --> 12:19.649
If you weren't a fed,

12:19.826 --> 12:23.455
Viktor over there would have already
made you pay for your disrespect.

12:24.297 --> 12:25.696
I'm Agent Jim Racine.

12:25.899 --> 12:27.366
I'm taking over
for Agent Daniels.

12:28.435 --> 12:30.164
What happened to Paul?

12:30.470 --> 12:31.937
Paul was dirty.

12:32.339 --> 12:34.637
But then I don't
have to tell you that.

12:36.043 --> 12:37.476
I've been playing the game.

12:37.677 --> 12:38.974
All the usual stuff...

12:39.146 --> 12:42.013
wiretaps, surveillance, shakedowns.

12:42.416 --> 12:43.974
And today I thought:

12:44.317 --> 12:46.581
"I'm spending all this time
looking at this guy,"

12:46.887 --> 12:50.323
"I ought to just come down
and meet him face-to-face."

12:52.059 --> 12:54.220
I hope you're not disappointed.

12:54.528 --> 12:55.927
On the contrary.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.694
It's a real thrill.

12:59.032 --> 13:00.727
It's a shame about Paul.

13:01.802 --> 13:02.962
I quite liked him.

13:03.136 --> 13:07.038
Of course you did.
He was weak and stupid.

13:07.274 --> 13:09.936
You're very sure of yourself,
Agent Racine.

13:10.510 --> 13:12.501
Is that gonna be a problem for you?

13:13.647 --> 13:14.978
Not at all.

13:18.385 --> 13:20.819
It will make it
all the more pleasurable

13:20.987 --> 13:22.477
when I break you.

13:31.932 --> 13:33.729
Don't be a stranger.

13:55.622 --> 13:58.284
So we're looking for a
Chinese gangster named Fat Au?

13:58.492 --> 14:00.824
- He's not Chinese.
- The Triads are backing him?

14:01.061 --> 14:03.086
It's kind of hard to explain.

14:03.363 --> 14:05.991
He's someone I knew
from the old days. Before your time.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.794
Rabbit's not gonna
be alone in that church.

14:08.001 --> 14:09.161
We need more firepower.

14:09.369 --> 14:11.289
- Oh, so he's a gun dealer?
- Among other things.

14:11.471 --> 14:13.530
- Are you sure he's gonna help you?
- No.

14:14.341 --> 14:16.605
We had a complicated relationship,

14:16.743 --> 14:17.869
but I did him a favor once.

14:18.578 --> 14:21.240
- I hope he remembers.
- Me, too.

14:34.928 --> 14:36.293
Hey, hey.

14:37.197 --> 14:38.596
Yeah, I'm looking for Fat Au.

14:38.798 --> 14:40.265
There's no Fat Au here.

14:40.467 --> 14:43.095
Yeah, I'm not a cop, okay?

14:43.336 --> 14:44.860
I'm an old friend of his.

14:46.072 --> 14:48.272
He's gonna be very upset
if he hears you turned me away.

14:48.408 --> 14:49.602
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:49.809 --> 14:51.276
This is a private club.

14:51.478 --> 14:53.158
- Get lost.
- I came a long way to see him.

14:53.213 --> 14:55.010
That's too bad.
Now get the fuck out of here.

14:55.448 --> 14:56.448
We better go.

14:56.683 --> 14:59.049
Hang tight. Just do what I do.

14:59.486 --> 15:01.386
- What are you gonna do?
- This.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.596
- You're welcome.
- Shit!

15:22.776 --> 15:24.141
Don't fucking move.

15:28.148 --> 15:29.706
Well, the good news is

15:29.950 --> 15:31.542
we're going to see Fat Au.

15:59.379 --> 16:01.677
Now who the fuck are you?

16:01.815 --> 16:03.975
- Are you kidding me?
- I look like a fucking comedian?

16:04.117 --> 16:06.381
You look like two fucking comedians.

16:17.831 --> 16:19.298
I heard you died, man.

16:21.268 --> 16:22.701
Yeah, I heard the same thing.

16:22.969 --> 16:24.664
Y'all get the fuck out of here.

16:25.005 --> 16:26.563
So you're running things now, huh?

16:26.773 --> 16:28.570
Somebody's got to keep the peace.

16:30.377 --> 16:32.607
Who is this you brought with you?

16:32.746 --> 16:35.010
- This is Ana.
- Hello, beautiful.

16:35.215 --> 16:36.682
What can I get you? Anything.

16:36.916 --> 16:38.781
Name it, it's yours.

16:40.453 --> 16:42.614
Eight Springfield automatics
with silencers,

16:42.756 --> 16:44.815
preferably the AAC
Prodigy suppressors,

16:45.091 --> 16:47.457
a few dozen ammo packages,
and something to carry it all in.

16:47.794 --> 16:51.389
Ooh, I hope like hell
you're sleeping with this woman.

16:54.034 --> 16:56.093
Listen, I don't have the money on me.

16:56.269 --> 16:57.429
Your money is no good here.

16:57.871 --> 16:59.231
You risked your life to save mine.

16:59.372 --> 17:00.452
I think about it every day.

17:00.640 --> 17:04.007
A few pieces of hardware
doesn't begin to make us even.

17:04.778 --> 17:05.778
Thank you.

17:06.246 --> 17:08.237
Now, with that being said,

17:08.580 --> 17:11.049
I've got to ask,
what are you gonna do with the guns?

17:11.751 --> 17:12.877
Target practice.

17:13.153 --> 17:15.018
Not below Canal Street, you hear me?

17:15.188 --> 17:16.712
You got it.

17:16.923 --> 17:17.981
All right, then.

17:18.191 --> 17:19.871
Package will be waiting
for you downstairs.

17:19.893 --> 17:21.827
- Just like that?
- Oh, honey.

17:23.029 --> 17:25.497
If I weren't so smitten,
I'd be insulted.

17:26.031 --> 17:28.500
Now, let's celebrate, huh?

17:30.070 --> 17:31.367
Soldier boy.

17:31.571 --> 17:32.731
Back from the dead.

17:34.307 --> 17:35.865
Today is a blessed day.

17:39.112 --> 17:40.636
Why did he call you "soldier boy"?

17:40.847 --> 17:43.372
- It's just a nickname.
- Yeah, I know, but why?

17:43.650 --> 17:45.948
I guess when we first met,
I was a soldier.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.779
You never told me
you were in the Army.

17:49.055 --> 17:51.080
Not in the Army. Not exactly.

17:51.291 --> 17:52.849
Anyway, it was a long time ago.

17:53.126 --> 17:54.650
How many lives have you lived?

17:54.828 --> 17:55.828
None, really.

18:03.503 --> 18:04.902
You ready for the diamond job?

18:05.338 --> 18:06.430
Will be.

18:08.975 --> 18:11.034
It's a big score. Big risk.

18:12.445 --> 18:14.106
You got something on your mind?

18:14.381 --> 18:16.906
So much money. So much risk.

18:19.085 --> 18:22.179
Some men would think
to take the money and run.

18:26.459 --> 18:27.551
Where would I go?

18:27.727 --> 18:30.025
I don't know.
But I would find you.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.426
You want to talk shit
or you want to box, huh?

18:32.766 --> 18:34.233
I want to fight.

18:44.277 --> 18:45.574
What the fuck, Olek?

18:46.646 --> 18:48.637
Whoo, that was a good shot.

18:49.315 --> 18:50.680
I see stars.

18:55.088 --> 18:57.147
You crazy motherfucker.

18:57.323 --> 19:00.053
That's why
they pay me the big dollars.

19:11.604 --> 19:13.401
You're quiet today.

19:16.476 --> 19:18.034
I'm just thinking.

19:20.380 --> 19:22.575
Are you worried about this job?

19:23.249 --> 19:24.876
We could still walk away.

19:25.251 --> 19:28.220
No. No, I think
we have that covered.

19:28.588 --> 19:30.180
So, what, then?

19:30.390 --> 19:32.187
It's nothing, Daddy. I'm fine.

19:36.029 --> 19:39.396
You wouldn't keep something from me,
would you?

19:43.036 --> 19:44.628
Of course not.

19:49.876 --> 19:51.366
He knows.

19:51.678 --> 19:52.975
He doesn't know.

19:54.247 --> 19:56.078
You didn't hear him
this morning.

19:56.249 --> 19:58.513
There's no way
he could possibly know.

19:58.918 --> 20:00.476
You're reading into things.

20:01.788 --> 20:03.278
I think we should wait.

20:07.393 --> 20:09.384
Hey, listen to me.

20:09.796 --> 20:11.457
He doesn't know.

20:11.531 --> 20:12.657
Okay?

20:13.466 --> 20:15.798
Look, every time we steal for him,

20:15.935 --> 20:17.232
we risk our lives.

20:17.470 --> 20:18.869
Why not risk our lives for us?

20:20.139 --> 20:23.438
- I just have a bad feeling about it.
- Hey, hey, hey.

20:24.210 --> 20:25.700
He doesn't know.

20:52.038 --> 20:54.768
It's two miles from the highway
surrounded by forest.

20:55.074 --> 20:56.974
At least we got that going for us.

20:57.176 --> 20:59.167
The package is in a safe
on the top floor.

20:59.546 --> 21:00.672
How do you know all this?

21:00.847 --> 21:02.144
You know a guy, I know a guy.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.975
Hey, you just worry about getting in.

21:04.317 --> 21:06.114
There are two guard dogs
on free patrol.

21:06.419 --> 21:08.353
The entrance has a fingerprint scan.

21:08.555 --> 21:11.080
The lobby has video
surveillance and infrared.

21:11.257 --> 21:13.217
This will get you through
the fingerprint scanner.

21:13.393 --> 21:15.193
As soon as you go in,
I'll kill the infrareds,

21:15.194 --> 21:16.661
but they're on an automatic reset.

21:16.863 --> 21:19.354
You got 12 minutes to get in,
crack the safe, and get out.

21:19.699 --> 21:21.758
The safe is a Xerxes XO series.

21:21.935 --> 21:23.129
That's no problem.

21:23.403 --> 21:25.268
It's not gonna be easy.

21:25.405 --> 21:27.168
Nothing worthwhile ever is.

21:27.307 --> 21:28.467
And then what?

21:28.808 --> 21:30.173
And then you don't call me.

21:30.410 --> 21:32.310
You don't e-mail me. Nothing.

21:32.545 --> 21:34.240
Y'all are gonna have the cops,
the feds,

21:34.480 --> 21:36.471
and the Ukrainian mafia after you.

21:36.716 --> 21:38.081
I don't know you anymore.

21:38.451 --> 21:39.884
You're having second thoughts?

21:41.220 --> 21:43.711
No. No second thoughts.
We'll get it done.

21:45.291 --> 21:47.282
These are your new documents.

21:47.660 --> 21:48.740
You're married, by the way.

21:48.861 --> 21:49.953
Mazel tov.

21:50.930 --> 21:53.194
- Thanks for everything, Job.
- Don't mention it.

21:53.466 --> 21:54.660
- No, I'm serious.
- I'm serious, too.

21:54.867 --> 21:56.027
Don't you fucking mention it.

21:56.135 --> 21:57.796
I don't care if they're
blowtorching your balls off.

21:58.004 --> 21:59.004
You hear me?

21:59.472 --> 22:00.472
I'll miss you.

22:01.074 --> 22:02.234
Good.

22:03.543 --> 22:05.135
Get the fuck out of here.

22:38.811 --> 22:41.245
A direct assault is exactly
the wrong way to go here.

22:41.381 --> 22:43.662
- Take it from someone who's tried.
- What do you suggest?

22:43.716 --> 22:45.513
Blow the fucking place
to smithereens.

22:45.685 --> 22:48.347
Nuh-uh. Too messy.
We got to be sure.

22:49.622 --> 22:51.351
This is fucking suicide.
I'm coming.

22:51.591 --> 22:53.684
Hey, you won't make it
to the lobby... Job.

22:57.497 --> 22:58.555
Get back in bed.

23:10.009 --> 23:11.067
Hey.

23:14.747 --> 23:16.681
How am I gonna know
if you're dead?

23:18.851 --> 23:21.445
You wake up tomorrow
and we're not here, we're dead.

23:30.863 --> 23:32.763
Like I'm really gonna sleep tonight.

23:38.037 --> 23:39.299
How we looking, Job?

23:39.472 --> 23:40.530
Police bands are quiet.

23:40.673 --> 23:42.163
I'm already into
the security system.

23:42.341 --> 23:43.341
Copy.

23:47.847 --> 23:49.280
Ana, come on.

23:50.983 --> 23:52.712
- Hey.
- We don't have to do this.

23:53.286 --> 23:55.083
- We can't back out now.
- Yes, we can.

23:55.221 --> 23:56.415
I'll talk to my father.
I'll tell him about us.

23:56.556 --> 23:58.116
He is never going to
let us be together.

23:58.191 --> 23:59.591
You know this.
This is the only way.

24:04.597 --> 24:06.565
Baby, I have a very bad
feeling about this.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.364
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

24:15.541 --> 24:18.305
Listen to me. It's gonna be okay.

24:18.411 --> 24:20.402
I want to report
a robbery in progress

24:20.513 --> 24:22.242
at the Capital Diamond warehouse.

24:22.315 --> 24:24.476
211 Saw Mill River Road.

24:31.624 --> 24:33.353
It's gonna be okay,
I promise you.

24:33.493 --> 24:36.929
Tomorrow we're gonna be
Tom and Carrie Palmer.

24:39.098 --> 24:41.259
We're gonna have
our entire lives ahead of us.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.992
- Promise?
- Promise.

24:44.070 --> 24:46.197
But right here, right now,

24:46.906 --> 24:48.931
we have to do this, okay?

24:49.108 --> 24:51.042
We have to.

24:51.477 --> 24:53.206
You ready?

24:58.317 --> 24:59.341
Yes.

25:00.853 --> 25:02.047
Okay.

26:50.463 --> 26:52.988
- Hello, Ana.
- Don't move!

26:53.900 --> 26:55.561
I am unarmed.

27:01.007 --> 27:02.941
- Layla.
- What?

27:04.110 --> 27:05.907
You have her face.

27:06.078 --> 27:08.012
- Almost exactly.
- Stay there.

27:08.547 --> 27:11.607
I'd hoped to meet you
in friendlier circumstances.

27:11.817 --> 27:13.910
Not likely with our family.

27:14.487 --> 27:16.216
Where is he?

27:16.355 --> 27:17.652
He is safe.

27:18.057 --> 27:20.389
Whereas you, on the other hand,

27:20.860 --> 27:22.384
are not.

27:30.603 --> 27:34.562
When a family goes to war,
there can be no victory.

27:56.696 --> 27:58.425
Him or us, right?

27:58.764 --> 27:59.890
Damn straight.

28:06.138 --> 28:07.298
Now!

29:14.974 --> 29:16.703
- You okay?
- I'm out.

29:24.283 --> 29:25.545
Me, too.

30:04.657 --> 30:07.683
Hey, stick to the trees for at least
two miles. You'll be fine.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.554
When I get up,

30:09.728 --> 30:11.286
you run like hell
for the back of the church.

30:11.430 --> 30:13.660
- No, I'm not leaving you.
- Listen to me! You do it!

30:14.300 --> 30:15.665
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

30:15.801 --> 30:17.359
I'm gonna throw them off.

30:18.404 --> 30:19.098
No.

30:19.238 --> 30:21.001
You do it and you get
back to your family.

30:22.041 --> 30:23.633
You hear me?

30:24.043 --> 30:25.476
Don't do this.
Don't do this.

30:25.678 --> 30:27.077
- We can make it.
- Hey! Hey!

30:27.246 --> 30:30.010
When I get up,
you run to the back.

30:30.616 --> 30:31.878
Understand?

30:32.017 --> 30:33.041
I'll catch up to you.

30:33.252 --> 30:34.685
I'll be right behind you.

30:38.591 --> 30:40.491
I love you.
I love you.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.341
No!

31:36.582 --> 31:38.015
Whoo.

31:43.122 --> 31:45.215
Seven guys with machine guns

31:45.357 --> 31:47.120
and you're gonna stab them?

31:47.359 --> 31:49.293
You really are
fucked in the head.

31:50.329 --> 31:53.169
I almost didn't shoot 'em just so I
could see you try and pull that off.

31:53.399 --> 31:54.866
Welcome to my life.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.160
Hi, guys.

31:57.570 --> 32:00.095
- I had it handled.
- The fuck you did.

32:00.739 --> 32:02.468
So when did
you two hook up again?

32:02.608 --> 32:04.269
Job tracked me down.

32:04.443 --> 32:06.934
Motherfucker walked right into my
office with his gun out.

32:07.079 --> 32:08.706
Looked like he was gonna pass out
right there on the floor.

32:09.348 --> 32:11.009
You try getting a fucking
appointment with you.

32:11.150 --> 32:13.744
How about we all go downtown,
get some breakfast?

32:14.653 --> 32:16.587
You can tell me what
the fuck happened here.

32:16.789 --> 32:18.709
I have a feeling it's gonna be a hell
of a story.

32:18.991 --> 32:20.458
You have no idea.

32:45.751 --> 32:47.309
This is one
fucked-up church.

32:47.586 --> 32:49.611
He's not who we came for.

32:50.356 --> 32:52.756
I'll make sure the cops
stay away for the time being.

32:52.925 --> 32:55.325
- Buy you guys some time.
- Thanks.

32:55.794 --> 32:57.159
Hey, soldier boy.

32:57.763 --> 32:59.287
Still want to hear that story.

33:00.566 --> 33:01.760
You will.

33:03.235 --> 33:06.136
This time, make sure
he stay dead.

33:06.872 --> 33:08.737
Come on, you crazy bald fuck.

33:08.974 --> 33:10.094
I'll buy you some breakfast.

33:11.710 --> 33:13.337
This could be the start
of a beautiful,

33:13.545 --> 33:15.342
fucked-up friendship.

33:20.352 --> 33:21.614
Morning.

33:26.058 --> 33:28.458
The relentless Agent Racine.

33:28.661 --> 33:31.152
I just figured I'd stop by.

33:31.397 --> 33:32.887
See what you've been up to.

33:34.266 --> 33:35.426
What's the expression?

33:35.601 --> 33:37.398
"Same shit,
different day."

33:38.437 --> 33:39.495
That's it, yeah.

33:40.673 --> 33:43.870
I spent the night
at the 13th Precinct downtown.

33:45.377 --> 33:46.901
They arrested some kid

33:47.079 --> 33:49.445
who managed to break into
the Capital Diamond building.

33:50.783 --> 33:52.842
It's not an easy
place to get into.

33:53.452 --> 33:55.352
Kid would have gotten
away with it, too,

33:55.487 --> 33:59.890
except someone
tipped off the cops.

34:00.926 --> 34:02.587
I want to report a robbery
in progress

34:02.761 --> 34:04.695
at the Capital Diamond
warehouse.

34:04.897 --> 34:06.262
211 Saw Mill River Road.

34:08.567 --> 34:09.567
I'm no expert,

34:09.568 --> 34:12.092
but that sounds a lot
like a Ukrainian accent.

34:12.338 --> 34:13.965
Doesn't it?

34:16.708 --> 34:17.708
Yeah.

34:18.777 --> 34:20.141
So I asked myself

34:20.612 --> 34:22.204
how many Ukrainians do I know

34:22.447 --> 34:24.416
who could report
a robbery in progress

34:26.150 --> 34:28.312
before that robbery
was actually in progress?

34:30.589 --> 34:31.783
And then I thought

34:31.989 --> 34:33.422
Rabbit is Ukrainian.

34:33.692 --> 34:35.853
Maybe he could point me
in the right direction.

34:36.328 --> 34:38.319
So what do you say?

34:39.264 --> 34:41.255
Can you...

34:41.400 --> 34:43.458
point me in the right direction?

34:46.237 --> 34:48.706
Go... now.

34:51.176 --> 34:52.404
Yeah.

34:53.178 --> 34:55.078
I had a feeling.

34:56.581 --> 34:57.913
Well...

34:59.451 --> 35:01.316
it was worth a try.

35:03.122 --> 35:04.885
Agent Racine.

35:06.058 --> 35:09.221
Someday I will lose my patience

35:09.628 --> 35:12.188
and this wall between us...

35:12.464 --> 35:15.092
the one you count on
to keep you safe...

35:16.935 --> 35:18.527
it will come down.

35:20.539 --> 35:22.439
That's what I'm hoping for.

35:55.040 --> 35:56.405
Yulish?

35:56.842 --> 35:58.810
- Is he dead?
- Yes.

36:01.180 --> 36:03.239
- And now me?
- Yes.

36:08.687 --> 36:11.622
There's a part of you that always
knows it will end like this.

36:13.926 --> 36:16.156
Bullets and tears.

36:17.095 --> 36:18.619
Yet you keep telling yourself

36:18.964 --> 36:20.625
you will find a way out.

36:22.034 --> 36:23.626
But there is no way out

36:23.836 --> 36:25.463
because of who you are.

36:28.173 --> 36:29.538
Sit with me.

36:30.509 --> 36:32.033
Just for a minute.

36:32.211 --> 36:34.372
Eternity can wait a bit longer.

36:56.835 --> 36:59.099
I got married in this courtyard.

37:05.043 --> 37:06.943
The band was over there.

37:08.847 --> 37:10.542
Your mother...

37:12.251 --> 37:13.946
she was so beautiful.

37:19.224 --> 37:21.283
I couldn't stop shaking.

37:21.527 --> 37:23.893
I thought I might pass out.

37:24.162 --> 37:25.561
Just breathe.

37:26.832 --> 37:29.630
Something in me broke
when she died.

37:37.342 --> 37:39.037
Budmo.

37:48.387 --> 37:50.787
I'm sorry, Anastasia.

37:51.390 --> 37:53.290
I hope in death I can give you

37:53.458 --> 37:56.052
some of the peace
I stole from you in life.

38:36.835 --> 38:38.564
Time will tell.

38:44.643 --> 38:46.406
Goodbye, Daddy.

39:06.665 --> 39:08.860
You look at me and remember.

39:09.301 --> 39:11.098
Somewhere in the future,

39:12.104 --> 39:14.038
there is a bench just like this

39:14.139 --> 39:15.629
waiting for you.

39:18.844 --> 39:19.902
Go to hell.

39:23.315 --> 39:24.612
Okay.

41:18.463 --> 41:20.363
- Hello?
- You fucking bastard.

41:20.732 --> 41:23.758
Anastasia.
I've been waiting for your call.

41:23.935 --> 41:25.994
- You turned us in.
- You lied to me.

41:27.005 --> 41:28.563
So what are you gonna do, huh?

41:28.774 --> 41:30.214
Are you gonna kill
your own daughter?

41:31.476 --> 41:33.410
No, you I forgive.

41:34.079 --> 41:35.671
Well, I don't forgive you.

41:35.947 --> 41:37.915
And I will tell your grandchild,

41:38.049 --> 41:39.880
his child, who you
will never know,

41:40.252 --> 41:41.776
what a sick fuck you were.

41:42.788 --> 41:43.812
You're pregnant?

41:43.989 --> 41:45.081
Fuck you.

41:45.257 --> 41:46.724
Anastasia!

43:25.023 --> 43:26.923
Look at that.
We made it.

43:27.659 --> 43:28.717
Banshee.

43:28.894 --> 43:31.795
It's kind of a strange name
for a town, don't you think?

43:31.963 --> 43:34.295
No, it's just a town
like any other.

43:43.642 --> 43:46.008
I think we're gonna be
very happy here.

44:19.811 --> 44:21.369
Rabbit?

44:22.047 --> 44:23.480
He's dead.

44:26.451 --> 44:27.782
You sure?

44:29.321 --> 44:30.321
Yes.

44:31.056 --> 44:33.854
Well, then, good riddance.

44:51.776 --> 44:53.300
What about Job?

44:53.511 --> 44:54.808
He stayed in New York.

44:54.980 --> 44:56.607
He's gonna look up
some old friends.

44:56.848 --> 44:58.315
Figure out his next move.

44:58.550 --> 45:00.780
It's gonna be strange
without him here.

45:01.786 --> 45:04.414
Then again,
it's strange when he is here.

45:06.658 --> 45:08.091
What about you?

45:09.761 --> 45:11.319
What about me?

45:11.529 --> 45:12.928
What happens now?

45:34.119 --> 45:36.417
I've got to go see someone.

45:36.921 --> 45:38.013
The deputy?

45:40.558 --> 45:43.220
You sure about that?

45:53.471 --> 45:56.531
Well, where would
we be without women to fuck us up?

45:57.976 --> 45:59.739
Hmm?

45:59.911 --> 46:01.674
I guess you came
back after all, huh?

46:05.316 --> 46:06.783
I guess so.

46:12.257 --> 46:13.724
How are things here?

46:17.095 --> 46:18.687
Emmett left today.

46:18.863 --> 46:20.558
Otherwise, all quiet.

46:21.466 --> 46:22.558
Good.

46:23.201 --> 46:24.668
That's good.

46:28.873 --> 46:30.433
I just wanted you
to know that I'm back.

46:32.777 --> 46:35.371
- See you at work tomorrow.
- Hey!

46:36.881 --> 46:38.178
Why did you come here?

46:40.785 --> 46:42.810
I needed to see you.

46:45.924 --> 46:47.653
So say that.

46:53.498 --> 46:56.092
I needed to see you.

46:58.236 --> 46:59.828
Well, now you've seen me.

47:02.674 --> 47:03.936
Yeah.

47:06.177 --> 47:07.872
Well, what are you gonna do now?

47:18.123 --> 47:19.556
It's okay.

47:43.181 --> 47:45.445
- How did you get in here?
- I have my ways.

47:50.622 --> 47:52.954
Do you have a message for me?

47:53.124 --> 47:54.250
No.

47:59.731 --> 48:02.564
So what can I do
for you, Amish girl?

48:03.201 --> 48:04.259
I don't know.

48:04.502 --> 48:06.299
What can you do for me?

48:21.986 --> 48:24.921
There can be no question
of your loyalty.

48:25.523 --> 48:26.820
There won't be.

48:37.101 --> 48:39.399
Is that a knife or are you just
happy to see me?

49:07.765 --> 49:09.062
You stupid bitch.

49:12.070 --> 49:14.402
You really think
you can come in here and kill me?

49:14.739 --> 49:15.899
Huh?

49:18.710 --> 49:21.440
Are you really
that fucking crazy?

49:30.221 --> 49:33.622
You can't kill me,
you stupid cunt.

49:35.693 --> 49:37.524
I'm the Thunder Man!

49:53.278 --> 49:55.746
I didn't realize
we'd crossed the state line.

49:56.014 --> 49:58.175
Yeah, about 10 miles ago.

49:58.349 --> 50:01.375
It already feels better,
you know? Safer.

50:01.552 --> 50:03.417
I think this is gonna
turn out to be the best decision

50:03.554 --> 50:04.680
we've ever made.

51:43.855 --> 51:45.015
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!

52:07.545 --> 52:09.979
I've got all the thunder I need.

52:29.967 --> 52:32.265
I was expecting Burton
to come pick me up.

52:32.603 --> 52:33.968
What happened?

52:34.105 --> 52:36.266
He's tying up some
loose ends for us.

52:36.441 --> 52:37.533
What loose ends?

52:50.354 --> 52:51.787
Who did this?

52:53.191 --> 52:54.556
I did.

52:55.927 --> 52:57.485
For you.

54:51.442 --> 54:52.875
Till next time.

54:58.482 --> 55:00.109
Till next time.

55:41.258 --> 55:43.055
Hey, Deva.

55:46.297 --> 55:47.787
Hello, Dad.

57:02.206 --> 57:05.664
One, two, three, four!

57:12.149 --> 57:13.878
Hell, yeah, bitch!

57:16.821 --> 57:19.483
One, two, three!

57:27.164 --> 57:28.722
Yeah!

57:56.260 --> 57:57.852
This is Chayton.

58:03.934 --> 58:05.697
What is it?

58:05.903 --> 58:08.770
Alex Longshadow is dead.

58:08.906 --> 58:10.430
Pack up.

58:11.008 --> 58:12.441
Where we going?

58:12.910 --> 58:14.241
Home.
