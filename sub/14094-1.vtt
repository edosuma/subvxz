WEBVTT

00:27.861 --> 00:29.112
Pull!

00:30.280 --> 00:31.989
Right face!

00:34.076 --> 00:36.828
Right forward, pull!

00:39.623 --> 00:42.083
Right forward, march!

00:43.919 --> 00:45.837
Count, keep count!

00:45.921 --> 00:49.424
One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four!

00:49.508 --> 00:51.467
Count, keep count!

00:51.552 --> 00:55.221
One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four!

00:55.305 --> 00:57.265
Count, keep count!

00:57.349 --> 01:16.701
One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four!

01:16.785 --> 01:18.703
Count, keep count!

01:18.787 --> 01:22.415
One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four!

01:22.499 --> 01:24.041
Count, keep count!

01:24.668 --> 01:28.504
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!

01:37.264 --> 01:39.182
Hey, Maggio! Hello!

01:41.018 --> 01:42.059
Hiya, Prew.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.023
What are you doing over here?

01:47.524 --> 01:49.358
Transferred over from Fort Shafter.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.236
- You quit the Bugle Corps?
- Yep.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.655
- For here?
- I didn't pick it.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.617
Oh, you made a very bad mistake.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.869
This outfit, they can give back
to General Custer.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.370
Yeah?

02:05.918 --> 02:07.752
Captain ain't in yet.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.381
I'll look around.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.609
What do you think you're doin'?

02:32.319 --> 02:36.405
- What's your name?
- Prewitt. Transfer from Fort Shafter.

02:37.449 --> 02:38.741
I heard about you.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.328
I heard about you, too, Sergeant.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.413
This here's a rifle outfit, Prewitt.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.291
You ain't supposed to enjoy yourself
before sundown.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.752
Put up your cue and come along.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.514
Grand went to the hospital yesterday.
Did you put him in the sick book?

03:01.598 --> 03:03.891
- Did you make out the morning report?
- I didn't have time, Sergeant.

03:03.976 --> 03:05.101
You're the company clerk, Mazzioli.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.645
Those medics didn't bring back
the sick book till late yesterday.

03:07.729 --> 03:11.274
- I'll tend to it right now.
- Thanks. I already done it for you.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.574
You're the best bugler
they got over at Shafter.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.868
You're the best bugler
they got on this whole island.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.411
That's true.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.747
I feel for you, pal.

03:26.832 --> 03:29.375
But from my position, I can't quite reach you.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.092
Ten-hut!

03:40.554 --> 03:42.096
- At ease.
- Morning, sir.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.849
Morning, men. Anything special for me
this morning, Sergeant Warden?

03:44.933 --> 03:47.643
- I've only a few minutes.
- Yes, sir. New man here.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.770
Oh, yes. Come in.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.362
Sir, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.406
Reporting to the company
commander, as ordered.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.409
At ease. Where's that service record?

04:05.704 --> 04:08.497
Born in Kentucky, enlisted
first at Fort Myer, Virginia.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.917
"Bugle Corps, First Bugler."

04:12.002 --> 04:15.546
Prewitt, I always make it a policy
to talk to my new men.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.673
Now, I have a fine, smooth-running outfit.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.635
If I like a soldier,
he can get to be a noncommissioned officer

04:20.719 --> 04:22.178
quicker here than anywhere else.

04:22.304 --> 04:25.222
But he has to show me that
he's got it on the ball.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.267
What kind of trouble were
you in in the Bugle Corps?

04:28.352 --> 04:31.103
- No trouble, sir.
- What made you transfer out then?

04:31.188 --> 04:33.230
It was a personal matter.

04:34.191 --> 04:37.318
- Something you wanted to ask, Sergeant?
- Why, yes, sir.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.820
Prewitt, you was a corporal
in the Bugle Corps.

04:39.905 --> 04:43.115
You took a bust to buck private
to transfer to an infantry outfit.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.618
Why? Because you like to hike?

04:46.036 --> 04:48.204
Or was it because
you couldn't stand to bugle?

04:48.288 --> 04:50.289
It was a personal matter.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.875
That's up to the company commander
to decide.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.001
Well?

04:55.462 --> 04:57.713
I was First Bugler for two years.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.967
The topkick had a friend
who transferred in from another outfit.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.552
The next day, he was made
First Bugler over me.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.554
I was a better bugler.

05:05.681 --> 05:07.890
And you asked out on account of that?

05:08.850 --> 05:11.727
Maybe it ain't sensible, but that's the reason.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.730
His feelings were hurt.
Kids they send us now!

05:14.815 --> 05:18.234
Well, we'll get your stripes back for you,
maybe an extra one for good measure.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.819
Do you know why you were assigned
to "G" Company?

05:19.903 --> 05:20.861
No, sir.

05:20.946 --> 05:24.991
I pulled a few strings.
I'm the regimental boxing coach, you know.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.909
Yes, sir.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.245
I saw your fight with Connors in the Bowl
year before last.

05:29.371 --> 05:32.081
- You should have won it.
- Thank you, sir.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.625
Our regiment got beaten
in the finals last December,

05:34.710 --> 05:36.419
but I mean to win this year.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.587
All I've needed was a top middleweight.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.008
I'm sorry, sir. I quit fighting.

05:42.134 --> 05:44.719
Quit fighting? When? What for?

05:45.721 --> 05:47.930
Well, over a year ago.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.017
Maybe you heard about
what happened with Dixie Wells?

05:51.101 --> 05:53.728
You mean that fellow that got hurt?

05:53.812 --> 05:55.896
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, I heard about that.

05:55.981 --> 05:59.191
It's too bad. I can understand how you feel.
But those things happen.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.527
That's why I decided I would quit, sir.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.780
You might as well say stop war
because one man got killed.

06:04.865 --> 06:08.409
Our fighting program is
the best morale builder we have.

06:16.334 --> 06:19.045
I've got a mighty sour company bugler.

06:19.129 --> 06:22.757
- How'd you like the job?
- Not if it means fighting.

06:22.841 --> 06:26.719
Looks to me as if you're trying to acquire
a reputation as a lone wolf, Prewitt.

06:26.803 --> 06:30.723
You should know that in the army
it's not the individual that counts.

06:31.266 --> 06:34.977
Well, you'll find that we won't put
any pressure on you in my outfit.

06:35.103 --> 06:38.522
Just don't make any mistakes in it, that's all.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.358
I've got to go into town.
Anything else for me today, Sergeant?

06:41.443 --> 06:43.652
The company fund report has got
to be made out, it's due tomorrow.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.030
- You make it out. Is that all?
- No, sir.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.491
Well, whatever it is, you fix it up.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.993
If there's anything that has
to go in this afternoon, sign my name.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.245
- I won't be back.
- Yes, sir.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.666
He'd strangle in his own spit
if he didn't have me around here

06:57.751 --> 06:59.668
to swab his throat out for him.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.296
Come on.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.727
You been in the army what now, Prewitt?
Five years? Five and a half?

07:16.812 --> 07:17.812
Yeah.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.940
Don't you think it's about time
you got smart?

07:22.359 --> 07:25.528
You know what you did just now
when you turned down Dynamite Holmes?

07:25.612 --> 07:29.657
You put your head in a noose.
Things are softer for a boxer in this outfit.

07:29.741 --> 07:31.450
Otherwise, you'd better know how to soldier.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.828
- I can soldier with any man.

07:45.549 --> 07:49.176
This place is gettin' to be like
the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

07:53.723 --> 07:54.974
Who is that?

07:55.058 --> 07:56.684
She's Captain Holmes' wife.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.270
You'll fight, Prewitt.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.481
You'll fight because Captain Holmes wants
to be Major Holmes.

08:02.566 --> 08:05.442
He's got an idea he'll make it
if he gets a winning team.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.987
And if you don't do it for him,
you'll do it for me.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.947
'Cause my job is to keep him happy, see?

08:10.031 --> 08:14.243
The more he's happy, the less he bothers me
and the better I run this company.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.955
So we know where we stand, don't we, kid?

08:18.039 --> 08:21.876
I know where I stand.
A man don't go his own way, he's nothing.

08:21.960 --> 08:25.880
Maybe back in the days of the pioneers
a man could go his own way,

08:26.006 --> 08:28.424
but today you've gotta play ball.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.264
Leva!

08:35.390 --> 08:38.642
Can't I once walk up to the supply room
and find you working with both hands?

08:38.852 --> 08:41.520
I can't do no better
on what you people pay me!

08:41.605 --> 08:45.232
Draw this man some supplies.
"G" Company squad room's on the top floor.

08:45.317 --> 08:47.026
Get rid of your bags and come back here.

08:47.110 --> 08:51.030
Leva will help you lug your stuff upstairs.
Save you making four or five trips.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.617
- Thanks.
- I just hate to see energy wasted.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.119
Besides, you'll be needing yours.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.166
Looks like a good man.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.628
I know his type. He's a hardhead.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.515
Her and them sweaters.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.809
I'll bet she's colder than an iceberg.

09:20.894 --> 09:24.313
Not her, Top.
She knows the score like I been tellin' you.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.066
- Is that right?
- Listen, not around here.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.068
But when I soldiered
at Fort Bliss with Holmes,

09:29.152 --> 09:31.445
I heard plenty about this lady, plenty.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.656
- You did, huh?
- Okay, not me.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.992
But I know some of the guys
she played around with, so don't tell me.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.828
I ain't tellin' you. You're tellin' me.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.294
- Good morning, Sergeant.
- Morning, ma'am.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.712
I'm looking for my husband.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.548
Captain Holmes just went into town, ma'am,
on business.

09:51.633 --> 09:55.010
He was to have left some things for me.
Do you know anything about them?

09:55.095 --> 09:58.097
No, I don't, ma'am.
Anything I can do for you?

09:58.181 --> 10:00.391
No, thanks.

10:00.475 --> 10:03.394
I'd be glad to help, ma'am.

10:11.695 --> 10:15.155
My husband's been telling me
a lot about you, Sergeant.

10:15.240 --> 10:19.243
- He says you're very efficient.
- Yes, ma'am.

10:19.327 --> 10:22.329
What is it that makes you
so efficient, Sergeant?

10:22.414 --> 10:24.039
I was born smart, ma'am.

10:25.208 --> 10:29.795
I love that. Well, goodbye, Sergeant.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.467
Man, she sure is one, ain't she?

10:35.552 --> 10:38.012
- One what?
- One woman.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.055
I've seen better.

10:47.397 --> 10:50.399
Karen? Karen?

11:00.869 --> 11:03.245
- Sorry I'm late.
- It doesn't matter.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.372
I got tied up with General Slater.

11:05.457 --> 11:08.375
- I bumped into him in the Officer's Club.
- Yeah?

11:08.460 --> 11:12.129
- What did the General have to say?
- Success, he said.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.341
Success in war, success in peace time.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.843
And not a word about my promotion.

11:17.927 --> 11:21.347
Sometimes I think
the old man's just waiting to ship me down.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.849
Well, if you'd spend less time
buttering generals

11:23.933 --> 11:26.352
and more time with your company,
you'd get that promotion.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.354
The company takes care of itself.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.274
I went over there today, looking for you.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.527
I had some business
to attend to at Kaneohe.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.821
That was all right, wasn't it?

11:37.906 --> 11:42.117
Of course.
I have no right to inquire into your actions.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.453
- That was our agreement.
- Then why bring it up?

11:44.537 --> 11:48.540
Because I wanted you to know I'm not
as stupid as you maintain all women are.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.584
Now, just what does that mean?

11:50.668 --> 11:53.253
- What are you accusing me of now?
- Of nothing.

11:53.338 --> 11:56.423
It's no longer any of my business
how many women you go out with, is it?

11:56.508 --> 11:59.301
But I wish you could
just be honest about it once.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.096
There's no reason I should try
to hide anything, is there?

12:02.180 --> 12:04.973
The way things are between us now,

12:05.058 --> 12:08.519
what right have you
to always be accusing me?

12:09.062 --> 12:10.437
What right?

12:12.774 --> 12:15.442
Are you going back to that again?

12:15.527 --> 12:19.279
How long will it be, I wonder,
before I'm allowed to live that down?

12:19.364 --> 12:21.865
How many times do I have to tell you
it was an accident?

12:22.492 --> 12:26.870
Please, Dana. I'm going to bed.

12:27.163 --> 12:30.207
Please get out of my bedroom.

12:57.444 --> 13:01.071
Captain Holmes says you don't want
to come out and fight for us.

13:01.156 --> 13:02.990
That's right.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.993
We thought we'd buy you a beer
and talk it over.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.036
We're the company boxers.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.248
I figured.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.385
Man, what I would not give
to have this character

13:23.470 --> 13:25.220
in the corner pool room in my hometown.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.894
Box as good as you used to,
we'd be a cinch this year.

13:31.978 --> 13:36.732
You ain't forget, division champs
get 10-day furloughs, did you, son?

13:40.487 --> 13:44.072
I'm Ike Galovitch,
platoon guide of your platoon.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.575
And don't think you're a tough guy, Prewitt.

13:46.659 --> 13:50.245
You no talk now, but out in the field with us
you sing different song.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.832
Listen, the guy don't have to fight if he
don't want to without gettin' kicked around.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.584
Now, we're playing pool.
Why don't you take off?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.669
- You want busted head, Maggio?
- No.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.671
Then keep your big nose out altogether.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.174
Training season starts next week.
You can pick up your stuff...

14:02.258 --> 14:05.677
Look, I told Holmes and I'm telling you.

14:06.429 --> 14:09.890
I ain't fightin'. I quit fightin'.

14:10.808 --> 14:13.227
You guys want to put the screws on,
go right ahead!

14:13.311 --> 14:17.439
- I can take anything you can dish out.
- Okay, Prewitt.

14:24.739 --> 14:25.989
Thanks.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.787
I just hate to see a good guy get it in the gut.

14:31.871 --> 14:36.250
You better get used to it, kid.
You'll probably see a lot of it before you die.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.176
You don't scare easy, do you, Prewitt?

14:46.636 --> 14:49.888
Do you know anything
in army regulations says I gotta box?

14:49.973 --> 14:52.808
Every boxer in this outfit's a noncom.

14:54.310 --> 14:58.814
I guess you've never seen a bunch of 'em
get together and give a man the treatment.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.777
What do you mean "chick"? She's 45.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.112
She's still too young for you.

15:05.196 --> 15:08.615
Now, listen, Warden, I'm a better man
than you any day, and don't forget it.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.409
I won't forget it.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.746
What's the deal with him, anyway?

15:14.831 --> 15:17.165
With Warden. I don't figure him.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.126
Warden?

15:21.170 --> 15:23.171
He ain't like the others.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.301
He'll make it tough on you.

15:27.385 --> 15:31.805
But he'll draw himself a line he thinks fair,
and he won't come over it.

15:31.889 --> 15:35.517
You don't see many
topkicks like him no more.

15:35.602 --> 15:39.521
He was with the 15th in Shanghai
when they saw their action.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.316
I heard about it down in the Philippines even.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.611
All I know is, he's the best soldier I ever saw.

16:03.046 --> 16:06.465
Hut! Hut! Hut, two, three, four!

16:06.549 --> 16:08.300
Hut! Hut!

16:10.887 --> 16:12.804
Count, keep count!

16:12.889 --> 16:16.850
One, two, three, four! One, two, three, four!

16:16.934 --> 16:18.769
Prewitt! Get in step, Prewitt!

16:18.853 --> 16:21.313
Hut! Hut!

16:21.397 --> 16:24.441
Prewitt, this is a drill, not a picnic.
Get in step!

16:24.525 --> 16:27.235
Hut! Hut! Hut!

16:28.279 --> 16:31.406
Platoon halt!

16:32.408 --> 16:34.743
Order arms!

16:37.413 --> 16:40.248
Left face!

16:41.459 --> 16:44.461
Prewitt, one step forward march.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.506
Prewitt, you march
like a drunken gooney bird.

16:47.590 --> 16:50.550
I gotta teach you how to drill. You stay here.

16:50.635 --> 16:53.553
Platoon dismissed!

16:56.182 --> 16:58.892
Detail, right face!

17:00.978 --> 17:03.980
Trail forward, march!

17:04.065 --> 17:06.775
Half left, march!

17:09.737 --> 17:11.863
Half right, march!

17:11.948 --> 17:13.865
Right flank, march!

17:13.950 --> 17:15.867
Left flank, march!

17:15.952 --> 17:18.869
To the rear, march! One, two, three!

17:18.954 --> 17:22.457
To the rear, march!
Rear, march! Rear, march!

17:22.541 --> 17:27.128
Rear, march! Rear, march!
Rear, march! Rear, march!

17:27.213 --> 17:31.007
Assemble your weapons. All right, start.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.928
A rifle's your best friend.

17:35.012 --> 17:38.890
In case it jams in combat,
it could mean life or death.

17:38.975 --> 17:43.812
So you gotta learn to strip 'em down
and put 'em back together again blindfolded.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.499
Your rear sight's way off.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.169
You'd be 50 feet off target at 300 yards.

18:07.253 --> 18:10.756
Now, that's what happens when a soldier
don't know how to assemble his rifle.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.760
Seven laps around the track, double time,
and keep this rifle at high port.

18:27.857 --> 18:31.109
Forward thrust, hold!

18:31.194 --> 18:34.613
Draw and recover, hold!

18:34.697 --> 18:37.657
Arm thrust, hold!

18:40.203 --> 18:43.205
Draw and recover, hold!

18:43.289 --> 18:45.248
And rest!

18:45.333 --> 18:47.292
Wide open, huh, Prewitt?

18:47.376 --> 18:50.128
Maybe seven more laps will teach you
to watch yourself.

18:50.213 --> 18:53.256
Are you crazy? I saw what you did!

19:13.736 --> 19:15.195
I'm tellin' you, Top, she's nothin' but trouble.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.655
You better keep your mind
off what you're thinking.

19:16.739 --> 19:19.658
What do you wanna do,
wind up in Leavenworth?

19:30.878 --> 19:33.755
I won't be back in time
to take retreat, Sergeant.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.591
- Or reveille, either.
- Yes, sir.

19:38.553 --> 19:40.846
All work and no play, Sergeant.

19:40.930 --> 19:43.807
All you do is sit around
sweating over papers.

19:43.891 --> 19:46.685
There are other things
in the world besides work.

19:46.769 --> 19:50.272
- You ought to get out more yourself, Warden.
- I've been considering it.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.650
Well, I'm going.
I'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant.

19:53.734 --> 19:57.279
It'll be here when you get back, sir.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.564
Well, if it isn't Sergeant Warden.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.153
You'd better step inside, or you'll get wet.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.740
I am wet.

20:41.824 --> 20:45.702
If you're looking for the captain,
he isn't here.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.996
And if I'm not looking for him?

20:49.373 --> 20:50.999
He still isn't here.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.418
Well, I'm looking for him.
Do you know where he is?

20:53.502 --> 20:56.171
I haven't the slightest idea.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.548
Perhaps he's "in town on business."

20:58.716 --> 21:01.718
That's the way you put it
the other day, isn't it?

21:01.802 --> 21:04.638
I got some papers
it's important for him to sign.

21:06.891 --> 21:10.727
I'll try phoning him at the club.
Maybe he's there.

21:10.811 --> 21:12.187
Don't do that.

21:13.356 --> 21:16.191
I never like to disturb
a man when he's drinking.

21:18.653 --> 21:21.071
I could use a drink myself.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.866
Aren't you gonna ask me in?

21:32.541 --> 21:35.710
The liquor's there, Sergeant, in the cabinet.

21:40.675 --> 21:45.428
You're taking an awful chance, you know.
My maid is liable to be home any time.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.224
No, she won't. Thursday's her day off.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.687
You think of everything,
don't you, Sergeant?

21:53.771 --> 21:56.439
I try. In my position, you have to.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.575
Are these really important?

22:07.660 --> 22:11.079
Yes. But not important to get signed today.
Tomorrow's okay.

22:15.209 --> 22:19.629
I got copies at the office,
so it won't be much work to fix them up.

22:19.714 --> 22:23.341
That's what I like about you, Sergeant.
You have confidence.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.427
It's also what I dislike about you.

22:25.553 --> 22:28.513
It's not confidence, ma'am. It's honesty.

22:28.597 --> 22:31.433
I just hate to see a beautiful woman
going all to waste.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.393
"Waste," did you say?

22:34.311 --> 22:37.814
There's a subject I might
tell you something about.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.900
I know several kinds of waste, Sergeant.

22:40.985 --> 22:44.362
You're probably not even remotely aware
of some of them.

22:44.447 --> 22:46.698
Would you like to hear?

22:46.782 --> 22:50.368
For instance, what about
the house without a child?

22:50.453 --> 22:52.787
There's one sort for you.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.541
Then there's another.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.214
You're doing fine, Sergeant.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.549
My husband's off somewhere,

23:04.633 --> 23:07.677
and it's raining outside
and we're both drinking now.

23:07.762 --> 23:11.473
You've probably only got one thing wrong,
the lady herself.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.476
The lady's not what she seems.

23:14.602 --> 23:18.646
She's a washout, if you know what I mean.

23:18.814 --> 23:21.483
And I'm sure you know what I mean.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.651
You gonna cry?

23:24.737 --> 23:26.529
Not if I can help it.

23:34.622 --> 23:36.372
What are you doing?

23:39.251 --> 23:42.378
I'm leaving. Isn't that what you want?

23:43.839 --> 23:47.383
I don't know, Sergeant. I don't know.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.963
Step on it, boy!

24:25.047 --> 24:26.464
- Speed it up.
- I'm speedin'.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.383
Payday, payday

24:30.719 --> 24:34.055
All right, Maggio. You wanna get paid?
Knock it off.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.225
Angelo, a dollar he's wrong, coming up.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.853
Hey, paisan, come here!

24:40.062 --> 24:43.022
Sorry, gentlemen,
I already won my bankroll in the latrine.

24:43.107 --> 24:46.151
Besides, it's a penny-ante game.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.903
All right, what are you covering here?

24:51.490 --> 24:54.909
Come on, buddy boy, we're goin' to town.

25:04.461 --> 25:07.130
Look, don't let 'em get your goat.

25:07.214 --> 25:10.758
We'll just dress up in civvies and we're as
good as the rest of the world, ain't we?

25:14.013 --> 25:15.930
Here, wear this.

25:17.266 --> 25:20.602
My sister sent it to me.
She buys everything too big.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.317
Look, first we'll hit a few bars, see?

25:27.401 --> 25:30.361
Then we go to a place of which I'm a member,
the New Congress Club.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.280
Girls.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.116
You got any prejudices against girls?

25:38.621 --> 25:39.954
That's what I thought.

25:42.166 --> 25:45.126
Well, now, looks like you're
all primed for a big night, Top.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.337
- Hello, Stark.
- Want some company?

25:47.421 --> 25:49.380
No, thanks. All tied up.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.174
Leva tells me you've been eyeing
the captain's wife

25:51.300 --> 25:53.051
like a hound dog at huntin' time.

25:53.135 --> 25:56.054
He has, huh?
What else did that character tell you?

25:56.222 --> 25:58.723
She took up with a lot of men
back there at Fort Bliss.

25:58.807 --> 26:01.351
Well, I wouldn't put stock in stories like that.

26:01.435 --> 26:04.979
This ain't no story,
'cause I was one of them myself.

26:05.898 --> 26:09.234
Not for long, though.
Sure is something strange about that woman.

26:09.652 --> 26:11.986
Yeah. Thanks for the tip.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.988
See ya.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.623
Hello.

26:23.707 --> 26:27.669
- I didn't think you were coming.
- Why not? I ain't late.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.507
No, I guess you're not.
But then I got here a little early.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.301
I must have been overanxious.
You weren't, though, were you?

26:35.386 --> 26:38.096
I stopped along the way
for a couple of drinks.

26:38.180 --> 26:40.473
You certainly chose
a lovely spot for our meeting.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.309
I've had three chances to be picked up
in the last five minutes.

26:43.394 --> 26:45.520
Well, that's par for the course around here.

26:45.604 --> 26:49.649
Well, I don't care for it.
I never went in much for back-alley loving.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.693
Take it easy.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.446
You probably think I'm a tramp.

26:55.531 --> 26:58.950
Now, what makes you think
I'd think a thing like that?

26:59.034 --> 27:01.160
Don't try to be gallant, Sergeant.

27:01.245 --> 27:04.205
If you think this is a mistake,
come right out and say so.

27:07.126 --> 27:11.129
Well, I guess it's about time for me
to be getting home, isn't it?

27:11.213 --> 27:13.923
- Well, isn't it?
- What's the matter?

27:14.008 --> 27:15.800
What started all this anyway?

27:15.884 --> 27:18.219
Do you think I'd be here
if I thought it was a mistake?

27:18.304 --> 27:20.221
Taking a chance on 20 years in Leavenworth

27:20.306 --> 27:22.640
for making dates with
the company commander's wife?

27:22.725 --> 27:26.769
And her actin' like Lady Astor's horse.
And all because I got here on time!

27:31.400 --> 27:34.027
Well, on the other hand,
I've got a bathing suit under my dress.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.487
Me, too.

28:15.736 --> 28:17.653
She's comin'.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.366
Why, it's Angelo Maggio!

28:21.450 --> 28:23.659
Greetings, Mrs. Kipfer.

28:31.001 --> 28:34.253
There you are, sweetie pie. Dues all paid up.

28:34.338 --> 28:37.256
Hey, who you got playing the piano there?
A hippo?

28:37.341 --> 28:39.509
Oh, Angelo, I don't think I've met your friend.

28:39.593 --> 28:41.511
Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

28:41.595 --> 28:43.971
Oh, you know how I hate it
when you boys are in this condition.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.556
You see that, buddy boy?

28:45.641 --> 28:48.684
A woman sees a soldier,
and, like that, she figures he's drunk.

28:48.811 --> 28:51.479
- Why? You know why?
- Because he is.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.857
Well, heavy drinking simply doesn't mix
with the entertainment business.

28:54.942 --> 28:57.485
Every respectable place
has to consider its future.

28:57.569 --> 29:02.073
Mrs. Kipfer, ma'am, you have my solemn
word your future will be safe with us!

29:02.157 --> 29:04.158
Angelo is one of my favorites.

29:04.368 --> 29:08.830
Annette, dear, take care of this
gentleman for me, will you, please?

29:08.914 --> 29:11.499
That'll be four bucks, baby face.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.710
Two for initiation fee,
two for this month's dues.

29:14.795 --> 29:16.129
What do I get for it?

29:16.213 --> 29:18.965
Members are entitled
to all privileges of the club,

29:19.049 --> 29:21.426
which includes dancing,
snack bar, soft drink bar

29:21.510 --> 29:23.928
and gentlemanly relaxation
with the opposite gender,

29:24.012 --> 29:26.514
so long as they are gentlemen
and no liquor is permitted.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.808
- Got it?
- I got it.

29:59.798 --> 30:04.302
Girls, here's some new poison.
This is Billie, Jean and Nancy.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.096
- Nice meeting you.
- Hi, there.

30:14.354 --> 30:17.315
Don't tell me the princess is your style.

30:20.027 --> 30:22.445
This is Suzanne and Roxanne.

30:22.529 --> 30:25.072
- Hello, there.
- Would you like to dance, honey?

30:25.157 --> 30:26.908
Hey!

30:30.537 --> 30:35.124
Much as I adore your company,
I hope I may be allowed to tear myself away.

30:35.209 --> 30:36.834
I just saw a few friends at the door,

30:36.919 --> 30:40.087
and I can also see
that I will be of no further use to you.

30:51.725 --> 30:53.935
Hi. You busy?

30:55.103 --> 30:57.021
What's your name?

30:57.105 --> 30:59.148
I'm Lorene.

30:59.316 --> 31:01.275
Lorene, huh?

31:03.612 --> 31:05.905
I haven't seen you in here before.

31:05.989 --> 31:09.909
I haven't been in here before.
My friend brought me.

31:09.993 --> 31:12.703
He and I, we're stationed out at Schofield.

31:12.788 --> 31:15.039
Oh, I didn't think you were a soldier.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.917
- What do you mean?
- Well, I...

31:18.001 --> 31:21.003
I'm a 30-year man. I'm in for the whole ride.

31:21.088 --> 31:24.465
Well, I suppose it's different when
a fella's gonna make a career of it.

31:24.550 --> 31:28.594
Ain't nothin' the matter with a soldier
that ain't the matter with everyone else.

31:28.679 --> 31:31.597
I like you just the same.

31:31.682 --> 31:34.433
I liked you the minute
I saw Annette bringing you in.

31:34.518 --> 31:39.939
You did? It's funny, I came in, I stood there
and saw you sittin' over here.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.483
Why don't you knock it off
or put a mute in that thing!

31:42.568 --> 31:45.528
I'll play loud as I want, you little wop!

31:45.654 --> 31:46.779
Little wop?

31:48.031 --> 31:49.907
Mess with me, fat stuff, and I'll bust you up.

31:49.992 --> 31:52.827
You must be in a hurry for trouble, wop.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.997
- Wait right here for me, will you?
- Yeah, sure.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.749
Gentlemen, you know I will not...

31:58.834 --> 32:01.127
This little Mussolini here
is tryin' to tell me how...

32:01.211 --> 32:03.045
Like to bust my eardrums
with the stinkin' noise!

32:03.130 --> 32:04.755
- Let's not be cruel.
- Break it up, Angelo.

32:04.840 --> 32:07.133
You men will just have to go
if you can't behave yourselves.

32:07.217 --> 32:10.469
- Only my friends call me wop.
- Do you know who that guy is?

32:10.554 --> 32:12.597
- What do I care who he is?
- Who is he?

32:12.681 --> 32:15.975
Fatso Judson, Sergeant of the Guard
in the stockade.

32:20.522 --> 32:21.981
I'm tellin' you, let him alone.

32:22.065 --> 32:24.358
I seen him nearly murder a guy once.
He likes it.

32:24.443 --> 32:27.695
Okay, bully boy, now you won the war.
Let's dance, huh?

32:27.779 --> 32:30.698
Yeah, we'll dance, we'll dance.
First I gotta calm my nerves.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.450
Let's go to a phone booth
or something, huh?

32:32.534 --> 32:37.246
Where I will unveil a fifth of whiskey I have
here under my loose-flowing sports shirt.

32:37.831 --> 32:39.582
Don't get hurt, pal.

32:50.010 --> 32:53.179
Your balance has got to be letter perfect.

32:53.263 --> 32:55.306
I thought you were gonna wait.

32:55.390 --> 32:58.309
- Bill here was telling me about surfboarding.
- Hello, friend.

32:58.393 --> 33:01.187
Just sit down and listen.
He describes it thrillingly.

33:01.271 --> 33:03.147
Do you know anything about surfboarding?

33:03.231 --> 33:05.316
No, nothing. Not a thing.

33:05.484 --> 33:09.028
You must be stationed inland, then.
I'm at DeRussy, so I get lots of chances.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.946
Yeah, but then we got mountains.

33:11.073 --> 33:12.948
Do you know anything
about mountain climbing?

33:13.033 --> 33:14.033
A little bit.

33:14.117 --> 33:16.327
- You a mountain climber?
- No.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.037
Do you know anything
about flying an airplane?

33:18.163 --> 33:19.413
I've had a few lessons.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.917
I can't fly, either.
What do you know about deep-sea diving?

33:24.920 --> 33:27.463
Bill, shall we move into another room?

33:27.547 --> 33:31.008
Sure. The air in here seems
to have gotten lousy, hasn't it?

33:31.093 --> 33:32.426
- I noticed that.
- Listen, fella...

33:32.511 --> 33:34.178
Come on, let's go.

34:38.784 --> 34:41.245
How was the deep-sea diver?

34:41.329 --> 34:43.080
That was a terrible way you acted.

34:43.165 --> 34:44.998
Maybe I was jealous.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.378
You're a funny one.

34:49.504 --> 34:52.882
What do you dames want?
To tease a man to death?

34:52.966 --> 34:56.594
What do you think Mrs. Kipfer hires us for?
She pays us to be nice to all the boys.

34:56.678 --> 34:59.930
You're all alike. Is it so important?

35:00.015 --> 35:03.559
It is important. We may seem all alike.
We ain't all alike.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.274
I'm sorry.

35:10.358 --> 35:11.942
Look...

35:13.862 --> 35:16.071
Let's go up to Mrs. Kipfer's parlor
and sit there.

35:16.156 --> 35:19.658
She lets us use it sometimes
for somebody special.

35:19.743 --> 35:21.702
I'll go ask her.

35:22.162 --> 35:24.538
- Then you're not mad?
- No, I'm not mad.

35:24.623 --> 35:29.043
Because if you're still mad,
I'd just rather we called the whole thing off.

35:29.711 --> 35:32.087
You certainly are a funny one.

36:11.711 --> 36:14.171
I never knew it could be like this.

36:14.256 --> 36:16.841
Nobody ever kissed me the way you do.

36:17.425 --> 36:19.176
Nobody?

36:19.261 --> 36:21.428
No, nobody.

36:21.513 --> 36:25.099
Not even one?
Out of all the men you've been kissed by?

36:26.434 --> 36:28.352
Now, that'd take some figuring.

36:28.436 --> 36:31.438
- How many men do you think there've been?
- I wouldn't know.

36:31.565 --> 36:34.900
- Can't you give me a rough estimate?
- Not without an adding machine.

36:35.068 --> 36:38.529
- Do you have your adding machine with you?
- I forgot to bring it.

36:38.613 --> 36:41.490
Then I guess you won't find out, will you?

36:43.410 --> 36:45.369
Maybe I already know.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.794
What's the matter? What are you hinting at?

36:53.962 --> 36:56.463
Why? Is there something to hint at?

36:56.548 --> 36:59.758
Maybe there's been a long line
of beach parties.

36:59.843 --> 37:02.428
- You must be crazy.
- Am I?

37:02.512 --> 37:05.681
What about when you and Holmes
were back at Fort Bliss?

37:05.765 --> 37:10.019
Did you ever hear of a soldier named Stark?
Maylon Stark?

37:15.609 --> 37:17.526
Why, yes.

37:17.611 --> 37:20.696
"Why, yes." You knew him, too, didn't you?

37:20.780 --> 37:22.698
Didn't you?

37:22.782 --> 37:25.951
I had to go and forget
you were like all the rest of them.

37:26.036 --> 37:28.829
Only it's true, ain't it? Well, ain't it?

37:39.007 --> 37:41.842
Why don't you tell me about it?
Tell me the story.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.011
There's always a story.

37:44.095 --> 37:47.097
You don't leave a person anything, do you?

38:05.492 --> 38:08.035
Come back here, Sergeant.
I'll tell you the story.

38:10.872 --> 38:13.123
You can take it back to the barracks with you.

38:19.881 --> 38:24.468
I'd only been married to Dana two years
when I found out he was cheating.

38:24.552 --> 38:29.390
And by that time, I was pregnant.
I thought I had something to hope for.

38:29.474 --> 38:32.685
I was almost happy
the night the pains began.

38:32.769 --> 38:35.813
I remember Dana was going
to an officer's conference.

38:35.897 --> 38:38.232
I told him to get home early,
to bring the doctor with him.

38:38.316 --> 38:42.111
And maybe he would have, if his conference
hadn't been with a hat check girl.

38:42.278 --> 38:45.572
He was drunk when he came in at 5:00 a.m.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.825
I was lying on the floor.

38:47.909 --> 38:51.829
I begged him to go for the doctor,
but he fell on the couch and passed out.

38:52.706 --> 38:55.833
The baby was born about an hour later.

38:55.917 --> 38:59.336
Of course it was dead. It was a boy.

38:59.421 --> 39:02.548
But they worked over me at the hospital.
They fixed me up fine.

39:02.632 --> 39:05.342
They even took my appendix out.
They threw that in free.

39:05.427 --> 39:09.430
- Karen?
- And one more thing. No more children.

39:11.599 --> 39:15.394
Sure, I went out with men after that,
and if I'd ever found one that...

39:15.478 --> 39:17.646
Karen, listen to me. Listen.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.527
I know.

39:23.611 --> 39:27.322
Until I met you,
I didn't think it was possible either.

39:43.506 --> 39:48.886
I enlisted, too. I came out here on my own
to get away from my hometown in Oregon.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.971
How come?

39:51.056 --> 39:53.348
I had a boyfriend.

39:53.433 --> 39:56.810
I was a waitress,
and he was from the richest family in town.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.396
He just married a girl
suitable for his position.

39:59.481 --> 40:02.483
After three years of going around with me.

40:02.984 --> 40:06.487
It's a pretty story, isn't it?
Maybe they could write a book about it.

40:06.571 --> 40:08.697
They did. Thousands of them.

40:09.491 --> 40:11.700
So I left and went to Seattle.

40:11.785 --> 40:14.078
I got there and I met a girl
just back from Hawaii,

40:14.204 --> 40:16.413
and she said she'd made
a lot of money working there.

40:16.498 --> 40:18.207
So I caught the first boat.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.209
I've been here a year and two months.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.419
You don't like it very much, do you?

40:22.587 --> 40:26.507
Oh, I don't like it, but I don't mind it.
Anyway, I won't be here forever.

40:26.591 --> 40:29.343
No. Sure. I mean, why should you?

40:29.427 --> 40:34.181
I got it all figured out. In another year,
I'll be home with a stocking full of money.

40:35.016 --> 40:36.517
And I'll be all set for life.

40:37.727 --> 40:39.186
Who is it?

40:46.736 --> 40:50.572
I didn't hear no sounds of combat,
so I thought you might want a drink.

40:50.657 --> 40:53.325
- You've been hogging the whiskey, Angelo.
- Not me, buddy.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.537
It's that Sandra.
She's a nice girl, but she drinks like a fish.

40:58.748 --> 41:01.125
I hope there's a cop under that.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.213
Keep pourin'. Keep pourin'.

41:09.134 --> 41:13.428
No, thanks. I don't drink.
I think it's a weakness.

41:15.557 --> 41:17.558
I grant you that.

41:19.811 --> 41:22.187
I don't like weakness. Do you?

41:22.272 --> 41:25.399
No, I don't like weakness, but I like to drink.

41:30.155 --> 41:33.031
Hey, what are you gonna do, marry this guy?

41:33.116 --> 41:35.534
You're grinnin' at him like you're his wife.

41:35.618 --> 41:37.035
Get out of here.

41:38.246 --> 41:40.497
Okay, okay. I'm goin'.

41:40.582 --> 41:43.834
Back to old long-legged Sandra.
I love 'em tall.

41:43.918 --> 41:46.378
Acres and acres.

41:51.593 --> 41:55.179
Enjoy yourself, paisan.
You need this more than I do.

41:55.263 --> 41:58.182
Tomorrow, you'll be back with the treatment.

42:00.435 --> 42:02.728
What does he mean?

42:04.314 --> 42:08.025
Hey, that was nice before,
the way you snuggled up in front of him.

42:08.109 --> 42:10.360
What's a "treatment"?

42:10.445 --> 42:15.532
Oh, some of the guys puttin' me over
the jumps 'cause I don't want to fight.

42:15.617 --> 42:16.992
Fight?

42:17.076 --> 42:21.538
Yeah, on a boxing team. I don't want to box.
I don't even want to think about it.

42:21.623 --> 42:24.124
Well, why should you have to box?

42:24.292 --> 42:27.294
Well, see, I used to fight.

42:27.420 --> 42:30.631
Middleweight. And I was pretty good.

42:30.715 --> 42:33.592
They know it. Well, anyway...

42:34.677 --> 42:37.846
Well, come on, tell me. I want to hear.

42:39.224 --> 42:41.850
Well, the thing is, see...

42:41.935 --> 42:44.561
I used to work out with this guy Dixie Wells.

42:44.646 --> 42:47.022
He was a real good friend of mine.

42:47.106 --> 42:50.317
Loved to box.
People on the outside had their eye on him.

42:50.401 --> 42:54.529
He was gonna come out of the army
and go right up to the top.

42:54.614 --> 42:58.867
Well, one afternoon,
he and I were sparring around in the gym,

42:58.952 --> 43:01.203
you know, kind of friendly-like,

43:01.287 --> 43:05.290
and he must have been set
pretty flat on his feet,

43:05.375 --> 43:08.794
because I caught him with a...

43:10.713 --> 43:13.090
No more than ordinary right cross...

43:14.592 --> 43:19.471
And he didn't get up, he didn't move.

43:19.555 --> 43:24.559
He was in a coma for a week,
and finally he did pull out of it.

43:25.353 --> 43:27.729
Only the thing was that he was blind.

43:33.528 --> 43:36.655
Well, I went to see him at the hospital
a couple of times,

43:36.739 --> 43:40.492
then, finally, I just couldn't go back.

43:40.576 --> 43:44.913
The last time, he and I started
talking about fighting, and...

43:47.292 --> 43:49.293
He started to cry.

43:49.377 --> 43:52.838
And seeing tears coming out of those eyes

43:52.922 --> 43:55.465
that couldn't see anything.

44:21.326 --> 44:25.078
I thought I oughta tell you.
Holmes spoke to his boxers last night.

44:25.163 --> 44:27.331
From now on, it's no holds barred.

44:27.415 --> 44:30.334
They aim to run you right into the stockade
if they got to.

44:30.418 --> 44:32.336
Let 'em.

44:32.420 --> 44:36.840
I'll help you as much as I can,
but I can't get too far out on a limb.

44:36.924 --> 44:40.177
I ain't riskin' losing my stripes.
I like this outfit.

44:40.261 --> 44:43.388
So do I. That's funny, ain't it?

44:43.473 --> 44:46.099
Yeah. Yeah, that is funny.

44:51.814 --> 44:54.024
Keep goin' in a straight line, Prewitt.

44:56.736 --> 44:58.653
Keep goin'!

45:05.119 --> 45:07.120
All right, that's enough.

45:19.634 --> 45:23.095
Okay, Prewitt, bury it.

45:35.066 --> 45:38.819
My hitch was up Monday

45:38.903 --> 45:42.280
Not a dog soldier no more

45:42.365 --> 45:45.367
I ain't a soldier no more

45:46.953 --> 45:50.122
They gave me all that money

45:50.206 --> 45:53.250
So much my pockets is sore

45:53.334 --> 45:55.794
Oh, my pockets is sore

45:55.878 --> 45:57.838
Yeah, that a boy!

45:57.922 --> 46:00.841
More dough than I can use

46:00.925 --> 46:04.094
Reenlistment blues

46:04.178 --> 46:05.429
Sing it, boys!

46:21.195 --> 46:22.404
Time!

46:39.672 --> 46:41.756
Clean up the mess, Prewitt!

46:43.342 --> 46:46.970
Hurry it up!
You're on fatigue detail, not a vacation!

46:57.732 --> 47:01.651
- Come on! Clean it up!
- Clean it up yourself!

47:02.320 --> 47:03.361
What?

47:03.446 --> 47:05.780
You heard me.
Rub your own nose in it a while.

47:05.865 --> 47:09.409
Prewitt, you know better than to talk back
to a noncommissioned officer?

47:09.619 --> 47:10.785
Yes, sir.

47:10.870 --> 47:13.747
But I've never liked being spit on, sir,
not even by a noncommissioned officer.

47:13.956 --> 47:16.082
You owe Sergeant Galovitch an apology.

47:16.250 --> 47:19.169
I don't think so, sir. I think Sergeant
Galovitch owes me an apology.

47:19.295 --> 47:21.213
- Corporal Peluso?
- Yes, sir?

47:21.297 --> 47:24.257
Have this man roll a full field pack,
extra shoes and helmet,

47:24.342 --> 47:27.969
take a bicycle and hike him up to Kolekole
Pass and back, then bring him to me.

47:28.137 --> 47:30.931
- Yes, sir.
- All right, Prewitt, let's go.

47:31.057 --> 47:32.224
Time!

47:42.610 --> 47:44.444
Hold it a minute.

47:47.949 --> 47:51.701
Go ahead, Prewitt, and have a cigarette.
I don't like this any more than you do.

47:51.786 --> 47:53.203
Thanks.

47:56.791 --> 48:00.460
I take it you're ready to apologize
to Sergeant Galovitch now?

48:00.545 --> 48:02.212
No, sir, I'm not.

48:03.589 --> 48:06.841
Peluso, take him up there again.

48:06.926 --> 48:10.220
Yes, sir. All right, Prewitt, let's go.

48:26.112 --> 48:30.615
You can't be decent to a man like that.
You have to treat him like an animal.

48:33.786 --> 48:36.037
Sergeant, prepare court-martial papers.

48:36.122 --> 48:38.540
Insubordination
to a noncommissioned officer.

48:38.624 --> 48:40.041
Yes, sir.

48:51.304 --> 48:53.430
- Only it's a shame.
- What is?

48:53.514 --> 48:56.725
Well, I was just thinking, sir, It's too bad
you've gotta lose a good middleweight.

48:56.809 --> 48:58.977
I don't care. I don't have
to stand for that kind of insolence.

48:59.061 --> 49:00.520
No, sir, you sure don't.

49:03.649 --> 49:06.192
I'll prepare the papers, then.

49:06.277 --> 49:09.404
The only trouble is that even
if he gets just three months,

49:09.488 --> 49:12.824
he'll still be in the stockade
when the boxing finals come up.

49:12.908 --> 49:15.660
Do you see any other way of breaking him?

49:15.745 --> 49:19.581
Well, you could double up
on company punishment, sir.

49:19.665 --> 49:22.125
All right. I'll throw the book at him.

49:22.209 --> 49:25.337
Yes, sir, if you think that's the way to do it.

49:34.180 --> 49:36.598
Nice goin', Sarge.

49:36.682 --> 49:41.478
Keep lookin', Mazzioli, you'll find yourself
scrubbin' this orderly room floor!

50:00.247 --> 50:03.625
Comin' through! Watch it!
Me and my waiters are working our tails off.

50:03.709 --> 50:05.752
Hot! Hot! H-O-T!

50:09.423 --> 50:13.009
How you doing, buddy boy? Better than
being thrown in the stockade, ain't it?

50:15.971 --> 50:18.556
How am I doing, Sarge?
I'm a rough man, man.

50:18.641 --> 50:20.934
Slow up a little there, Angelo,
so you can stop sweating in the food.

50:21.018 --> 50:22.977
Don't hold me back, Sarge.
Don't hold me back.

50:23.062 --> 50:25.313
I'm putting in for corporal tomorrow.
Well, you'll never make it.

50:25.398 --> 50:27.524
- Hiya, Sarge.
- Hiya, Top.

50:39.537 --> 50:41.663
Life in a rifle company.

50:44.417 --> 50:46.459
You look awful tired, kid.

50:47.920 --> 50:50.213
How do you like straight duty?

50:50.297 --> 50:53.675
- What makes you think I mind it, Warden?
- I didn't say you minded it.

50:53.759 --> 50:56.052
I just said you looked tired.
You know, drawn to a fine edge.

50:56.137 --> 51:00.056
Oh, I like this life. It's a great life.

51:00.141 --> 51:02.225
If I find a pearl, I'll cut you in.

51:02.309 --> 51:04.269
Fifty-fifty. You know what I mean?

51:04.353 --> 51:06.813
If you didn't put me here,
I'd have no chance to find it, right?

51:06.897 --> 51:10.316
Now, there's a man for you.
What do you know?

51:10.401 --> 51:13.445
Since you like it so much,
I'll see if I can find some more for you.

51:13.529 --> 51:15.488
How about garbage detail?

51:15.573 --> 51:17.574
Thanks. I had that on Wednesday.

51:17.658 --> 51:21.244
So you did. What about street cleaning?

51:21.328 --> 51:24.706
- Yesterday.
- You got a better memory than me.

51:24.790 --> 51:26.750
Of course, if you were smart...

51:27.668 --> 51:28.918
Yeah, but I ain't smart.

51:29.003 --> 51:32.213
I know, but if you were,
you wouldn't have to pull K.P.,

51:32.298 --> 51:34.215
or any other fatigue duty, for that matter.

51:35.259 --> 51:39.262
If you think you can bribe me into boxing,
Warden, you're wrong.

51:39.346 --> 51:44.058
You're wrong. Not you
and Dynamite Holmes and the treatment.

51:50.941 --> 51:54.319
How long are you guys gonna keep
breaking it off on that kid Prewitt?

51:54.403 --> 51:57.614
You've had him on that extra duty roster
a month already.

51:57.698 --> 51:59.616
- I can't see why you...
- Can't you, Pete?

51:59.700 --> 52:01.367
What's the matter, you getting soft
in your old age?

52:01.452 --> 52:03.453
Maybe I want to teach the kid a lesson.

52:03.537 --> 52:05.455
- Maybe you like it.
- Maybe I do.

52:05.539 --> 52:08.875
I'm getting sick and tired watching you
being a stooge for Holmes.

52:10.169 --> 52:12.128
Yeah, well, you ain't gonna
see it much longer.

52:12.213 --> 52:14.422
I'm getting sick and tired of it myself.
I'm through, Pete.

52:14.507 --> 52:16.925
Any day now, and I mean it!

52:17.009 --> 52:20.053
Listen, if Holmes would let me,
I'd transfer out of here tomorrow.

52:20.137 --> 52:22.138
There's half a dozen companies
in this regiment that'd grab me.

52:22.223 --> 52:24.516
- And in grade, too.
- Oh, sure.

52:24.600 --> 52:28.686
I could be chief of staff, too, only I just
can't think of leaving my old buddies.

52:28.771 --> 52:30.688
Where are you going, Little Sir Echo?

52:30.773 --> 52:33.900
To take my shower, if the stinking
First Sergeant has no objections.

52:33.984 --> 52:35.902
Where'd you think?
To the movies in this towel?

52:35.986 --> 52:37.904
Hurry up. We'll get some beer.

52:37.988 --> 52:40.740
I wouldn't drink with you
if it was the last beer in the world.

52:40.825 --> 52:42.408
I'm buying.

52:43.118 --> 52:44.577
That's different.

52:50.876 --> 52:52.919
Wow!

53:06.433 --> 53:08.351
Rose.

53:10.020 --> 53:12.355
You know why I like
to have you serve me beer?

53:12.439 --> 53:14.941
So's I can watch you when you walk away.

53:17.736 --> 53:21.364
It's in regulations.
You got a right to complain.

53:21.448 --> 53:24.117
You got a right to take your case
to the inspector general.

53:24.201 --> 53:27.036
Any soldier has, even a plain dogface.

53:27.121 --> 53:30.498
No. I ain't gonna complain.

53:30.583 --> 53:32.792
They ain't gonna get that satisfaction.

53:35.462 --> 53:39.215
Believe it or not,
this is one soldier that's got a real big family.

53:39.300 --> 53:41.759
Fifteen of 'em,
'course this is only half of them.

53:41.844 --> 53:45.263
You see the gentleman with the handlebars?
That's Mr. Maggio.

53:45.347 --> 53:47.891
Mr. Maggio is my father.

53:50.686 --> 53:52.437
Never saw anybody so stubborn.

53:52.521 --> 53:54.731
How long is it since they
let you go into town?

53:54.815 --> 53:57.233
- Six weeks.
- It's liable to be six years.

53:57.318 --> 53:59.736
How'd you like it,
six years before you see a dame?

53:59.820 --> 54:02.864
Look, why don't you just
mind your own business, huh?

54:02.948 --> 54:05.783
And where did you learn to play the bugle?

54:40.694 --> 54:42.528
That's my buddy boy!

54:57.711 --> 54:59.796
Who's the broad?

54:59.880 --> 55:01.381
My sister.

55:12.059 --> 55:13.977
Maggio, what are you doin'?

55:15.604 --> 55:18.856
- You hit me!
- Yeah, and I'm about to do it again, too.

55:21.694 --> 55:25.196
- Why, you dirty wop!
- If you want to fight, take it outside!

55:25.280 --> 55:27.198
I'm gonna cut this wop's heart out.

55:27.282 --> 55:30.034
Anybody steps in here, I give it to him first.

55:31.954 --> 55:35.039
One step further, Fatso,
and I'm gonna de-brain you. I'll kill...

55:35.124 --> 55:38.126
Nobody's gonna do nothin'! Anybody
does any killing around here, I'll do it!

55:38.210 --> 55:40.795
- This is a private affair, Warden.
- No, it ain't!

55:40.879 --> 55:42.797
This man's in my company!

55:42.881 --> 55:45.758
You ain't making two extra weeks'
paperwork for me for nothing.

55:47.052 --> 55:48.344
Out for blood, huh?

55:48.429 --> 55:50.430
You'd puke your guts out
at the sight of a dead man.

55:50.556 --> 55:53.141
Put down that stool. Put it down!

55:59.106 --> 56:00.732
Drop that knife.

56:05.070 --> 56:08.823
Okay, Fatso, if it's killing you want, come on.

56:11.035 --> 56:12.869
Well, come on.

56:17.624 --> 56:19.625
On the floor!

56:31.764 --> 56:35.975
Killers, huh? I'd trade the pair
of you for a good Camp Fire girl.

56:44.860 --> 56:47.028
Tough monkey.

56:47.112 --> 56:50.782
Guys like you end up
in the stockade sooner or later.

56:50.866 --> 56:53.910
Someday you'll walk in, I'll be waiting.

56:53.994 --> 56:55.912
I'll show you a couple of things.

57:15.682 --> 57:17.892
I'm gonna get a breath of air.

57:27.027 --> 57:29.946
I'm glad he stopped it.

57:30.030 --> 57:32.073
He's a good man.

57:51.260 --> 57:53.177
You keep it.

57:53.262 --> 57:55.221
Keep it for a souvenir.

57:56.348 --> 57:57.723
Okay, I'll keep it.

57:58.642 --> 58:00.893
You ain't enjoying life much, are you, kid?

58:06.316 --> 58:07.733
Prewitt.

58:10.696 --> 58:13.281
Could you stand a weekend pass?

58:13.365 --> 58:14.866
Could I...

58:16.410 --> 58:18.119
What about Holmes?

58:18.245 --> 58:22.165
Don't worry about Holmes. He signs anything
I put in front of him without reading it.

58:22.416 --> 58:24.584
Sure could use it.

58:29.548 --> 58:33.176
I hear you gone dippy over some dame
down at the New Congress Club.

58:33.260 --> 58:36.554
- What'd you say her name was?
- Lorene.

58:36.638 --> 58:38.681
Beautiful name.

58:54.531 --> 58:56.324
Hey, paisan!

58:56.450 --> 58:58.492
What's holding you up? Let's get going?

58:58.577 --> 59:00.703
What's the matter, buddy boy?
Don't you like it here?

59:00.787 --> 59:02.121
You got something better to do in town?

59:02.206 --> 59:04.957
Look, the bus is leaving right away.
I'm taking the bus, right?

59:05.042 --> 59:08.211
Take off. You're talking to a rich man.
I'll hop a taxi.

59:08.295 --> 59:10.296
I'll meet you at the Kalakaua, later.

59:20.515 --> 59:22.308
Maggio, get ready for guard.

59:22.684 --> 59:24.644
Campaign hat, cartridge belt and weapon.

59:24.728 --> 59:26.646
Report to the orderly room in 10 minutes.

59:26.730 --> 59:28.439
What? I got a pass!

59:28.607 --> 59:31.150
Not anymore. Anderson's sick.
You're on guard.

59:31.235 --> 59:33.402
I just had guard yesterday. Why me?

59:33.487 --> 59:37.156
I'll tell you why you.
You should've gotten dressed faster.

59:44.665 --> 59:47.750
I sure never figured
in your giving me the runaround.

59:47.834 --> 59:50.753
- They didn't even want to let me in this place.
- We're mobbed, that's why.

59:50.837 --> 59:53.422
There's a big crowd from Hickam Field,
and they got in here first.

59:53.507 --> 59:55.424
Anyway, what'd you expect,
a brass band to meet you?

59:55.509 --> 59:58.928
- No. I did think you'd want to see me.
- I'm busy, can't you see?

59:59.012 --> 01:00:01.389
- Yes, I can see. It's crowded.
- Well, I am.

01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:06.686
Look, Maggio's gonna be
at the Kalakaua Inn later.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.729
Ain't there no way you can get out of here?

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:11.023
What's the matter with you?

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:14.193
I work here, you know, after all.
Can't you understand?

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:20.533
Yes, I do. I understand.
I understand very well.

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:25.121
You haven't been around here in weeks,
and now you turn up all of a sudden and...

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:27.915
Watch it, Mack! Watch where you're going!

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.917
Come on out of here.

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:42.013
Don't you think Mrs. Kipfer has rules?
I can't just walk out.

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:44.598
And even if I could, she doesn't like us
to see the boys on the outside.

01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:47.977
Look, if you feel that way,
just forget about it, okay?

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:50.021
You haven't any claims on me, Mister.

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:52.857
- You're not my husband, you know.
- There you are, Lorene.

01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:55.943
I vastly admire your taste, my dear,
but we really need Lorene now.

01:00:56.028 --> 01:00:58.779
So many of the gentlemen are unattended.
It is such a rush, isn't it?

01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:00.781
- Yeah.
- One might almost mistake us...

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:03.409
For one of those
big political conventions in Philadelphia.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:06.245
- You are coming, Lorene?
- In a minute.

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:12.168
- I'm sorry.
- How do you think I feel?

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:15.421
I may not get another pass for months.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:20.634
I've been counting on this
like a kid counts on Christmas.

01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:24.638
But forget it. Forget it. Lorene's busy.
Lorene has got work to do. Lorene's sorry.

01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:26.724
Oh, stop calling me Lorene!
My name's Alma!

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:28.768
- Alma?
- Yes, Alma Burke!

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:30.269
Alma?

01:01:33.398 --> 01:01:37.902
Mrs. Kipfer picked "Lorene"
out of a perfume ad.

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:40.404
She thought it sounded French.

01:01:58.465 --> 01:02:01.425
Hey, how'd you get away?

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:03.511
I told Mrs. Kipfer I was sick.

01:02:03.595 --> 01:02:06.180
- But I bet she doesn't believe it.
- I bet she doesn't.

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:09.392
- What'll you have?
- A coke, please.

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:11.852
Yeah, give her a Coke. Big Coke.

01:02:11.937 --> 01:02:14.522
It's great you meeting me here, you know?

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:16.732
See, I'm just lucky getting in town.

01:02:16.817 --> 01:02:20.111
- Topkick gave me a break.
- They still pouring it on?

01:02:20.195 --> 01:02:22.988
Holmes and those others,
they really got me on the edge.

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:26.575
- Gee, you must hate the army.
- No, I don't hate the army.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.577
But look what it's doing to you.

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.746
I love the army.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:34.083
But it sure doesn't love you.

01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:38.921
A man loves a thing,
that don't mean it's gotta love him back.

01:02:39.339 --> 01:02:42.049
Yeah, but a person can stand just so much.

01:02:44.052 --> 01:02:46.137
You love a thing, you've got to be grateful.

01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:49.098
See, I left home when I was 17.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:54.228
Both my folks is dead, and I didn't belong
no place till I entered the army.

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:56.897
If it weren't for the army,
I wouldn't have learned how to bugle.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:59.775
- To bugle?
- Yeah.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:03.028
That's the mouthpiece that I used
when I played a Taps at Arlington.

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:09.034
They picked me to play a Taps
at Arlington cemetery on Armistice Day.

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:11.120
The president was there.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.375
I play the bugle well.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:18.335
Hello, citizens!

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:22.631
- Hey, where you been?
- Hi, pals.

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:25.426
I've been in three bars,
and I put a dent in all three of them.

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:28.679
- Yeah, you look it.
- Give me a nail, Prew. I'm hungry for a nail.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.764
What you doing in uniform?

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:33.893
I'm thinking of joining the army.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:36.979
Or maybe I'll go to Mexico
and become a cowboy.

01:03:37.063 --> 01:03:38.606
You want to go with me?

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:42.318
You keep on drinking,
you'll be as much use as a melted candle.

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:46.405
You're absolutely right. Bartender, whiskey!

01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:48.032
Large whiskey.

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:52.411
Excuse me. Hey, buddy.

01:03:52.704 --> 01:03:54.288
Sam!

01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:59.168
Hey, comin' out, fellas.
The terror of Gimbel's basement.

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:02.796
Stand back there, now. Here we go.
A seven for daddy. Five, deuce.

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:05.633
Hey, seven.

01:04:06.218 --> 01:04:09.678
Snake eyes. That's the story of my life.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.436
Hey, Prew, that's the Royal Hawaiian Hotel
around the corner.

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:19.522
That's where all those movie stars stay.

01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:23.526
Listen, paisan, you'd better simmer down.
You got a whole weekend ahead of you.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:26.946
- That's what you say, buddy.
- What do you mean?

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:29.698
- They only gave you an overnight pass?
- No pass.

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:34.036
No pass at all. They put me on
guard duty, but old Angelo, he foxed 'em.

01:04:34.246 --> 01:04:36.163
You walked off guard?

01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:38.541
I checked in, and I checked right out again.

01:04:38.625 --> 01:04:41.710
You get your tail right back to the post.
You're in trouble. You know that.

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:44.380
Hey, hey, Prew, Prew, I got a good idea.

01:04:44.464 --> 01:04:46.715
Let's go swimmin'!
We'll go swimming with a movie star.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.093
That's what I'm gonna do,
go swim with a movie star!

01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:50.219
Listen, Angelo...

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:52.638
Twenty feet tall!
I'm going swimmin' with a movie star.

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:57.643
You'd better go.

01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:09.446
Hey, Angelo.

01:05:12.576 --> 01:05:15.035
Jerk, get up. Wake up.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.496
I'm awake, I'm awake.
What are you hollering?

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:19.582
Yeah, you're awake.
Put your clothes on, all right?

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:23.210
Give them back to the Indians.
The Indians need the clothes.

01:05:23.295 --> 01:05:26.589
All they wear is G-strings.

01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:29.925
You ain't drunk. Come on, get up.

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:35.598
Hey, I am waiting here for a movie star
to come out of the hotel,

01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:38.183
and I am not going until she shows up.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.477
Put your clothes on.

01:05:41.563 --> 01:05:44.690
Let's get out of here before
we get in trouble, okay?

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:48.611
What's the matter with you?
Can't a man get drunk?

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:51.155
Can't a man do nothin'?

01:05:51.573 --> 01:05:57.077
Can't he put his lousy hands
in his lousy pockets on a lousy street?

01:05:57.162 --> 01:05:59.955
A man gotta be hounded all his life?

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.916
Well, I'm tired. I ain't no criminal.

01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:06.003
- I ain't no coward!
- Buddy boy, look.

01:06:07.172 --> 01:06:10.424
You get dressed, you put your clothes on.

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:13.969
- Will you wait for me? I'll get a cab.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:16.680
- Will you wait?
- Yeah, you get a cab.

01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:35.199
Hey, M.P.S! Come and get me, you guys!

01:06:35.283 --> 01:06:37.284
Here I am!

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:45.000
Is that the best you can do?
I bet you guys eat Wheaties!

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.763
Any word on Maggio's court-martial yet?

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:01.016
- It's on right now.
- He'll get the stockade sure.

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:05.938
Maybe he won't get it.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.940
All he did was to get drunk.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:12.069
It's a soldier's nature.
It's almost his sacred duty once in a while.

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:14.154
But he walked off guard. He went A.W.O.L.

01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:16.824
- What're you hanging around here for?
- Can't a man rest?

01:07:16.908 --> 01:07:19.910
What man? You got no work?
Maybe I can scare you up some.

01:07:27.836 --> 01:07:30.921
Go on and shoot some pool.
Any word comes through, I'll let you know.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:38.429
Company "G."
First Sergeant Warden speaking. Yes, sir.

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:46.687
Yes, sir, I'll have his things in order.

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:51.608
He got it. Six months.

01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:05.581
I'm gonna escape from this dump.

01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:08.167
Gimbel's basement couldn't hold me,
neither can no lousy stockade.

01:08:08.251 --> 01:08:10.627
- Shut up.
- Whatever you say, Brownie.

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:14.006
Prisoner, halt!

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.108
Hello, tough monkey.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:50.459
This other girl and I were lucky to rent it.

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:52.669
This is a very fashionable district.

01:08:54.589 --> 01:08:56.506
I have another key made for you.

01:08:56.591 --> 01:08:59.843
You can use it any time you want to,
even when I'm not here.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:10.895
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:13.689
This is Prew, the soldier I told you about.

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:16.652
- This is Georgette, my roommate.
- Well, welcome, friend.

01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:19.363
There hasn't been a man around the house
since the cat died.

01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:23.450
I belong to the Book Guild Club.
I always take every book.

01:09:23.535 --> 01:09:25.410
That's the way I get all the dividends.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.832
She'll be great for your friend Maggio
when he gets out of the stockade.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:33.252
Yes, he'll be crazy about her.

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.881
Just sit down and get comfortable.

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:41.885
I'll make you a martini
and see what's to cook for dinner.

01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:45.680
Hey, this is like being married, ain't it?

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:47.765
It's better.

01:10:07.495 --> 01:10:09.454
You okay?

01:10:30.935 --> 01:10:32.853
Glad you came?

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:05.177
Let's get out of here. Don't look around.

01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:43.090
It can't go on like this much longer.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:47.302
Even when we sneaked
clear across the island tonight,

01:11:47.387 --> 01:11:50.639
we had to run out like jailbirds.

01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:58.897
If there was only some way we...

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:01.692
Holmes would probably give you a divorce,

01:12:01.776 --> 01:12:04.236
but he'd never let me
transfer out of his outfit.

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.198
There is a way.

01:12:09.867 --> 01:12:13.412
I've been thinking about it.
You've got to become an officer.

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:17.666
You can take the new extension course,
the one they passed last May.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.835
When you get your commission,
they'd ship you back to the States.

01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:21.837
An officer?

01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:25.841
Yes. Then I could divorce Dana
and marry you.

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:28.552
I hate officers! I've always hated officers!

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:31.972
Well, that's a fine, intelligent point of view.

01:12:32.056 --> 01:12:35.851
Suppose I said I always hated sergeants?
That'd make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?

01:12:36.978 --> 01:12:39.604
You sure made a complete study of it.

01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:45.152
Okay, suppose I did it.
And don't think it's a cinch.

01:12:45.445 --> 01:12:47.571
Then you'd be getting your divorce here
while I was in the States.

01:12:47.655 --> 01:12:49.865
We'd be apart maybe six months.
We're sure to be into a war by then.

01:12:49.949 --> 01:12:51.867
Why don't you tell the truth?

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:54.036
You just don't want the responsibility.

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.038
You're probably not even in love with me.

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:58.123
You're crazy! I wish I didn't love you!

01:12:58.207 --> 01:12:59.791
Maybe I could enjoy life again.

01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:10.886
So they were married
and lived unhappily ever after.

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:16.558
I've never been so miserable in my life
as I have since I met you.

01:13:17.143 --> 01:13:19.061
Neither have I.

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:21.480
I wouldn't trade a minute of it.

01:13:21.647 --> 01:13:23.023
Neither would I.

01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:28.987
I'll probably make the lousiest officer
in this man's army you ever saw.

01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:32.157
You'll make a fine officer.

01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:35.327
A remarkable officer.

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:42.501
Thank you.

01:13:45.379 --> 01:13:47.255
Come here.

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:52.010
Can't you wait until we finish dinner?

01:13:55.473 --> 01:13:57.599
- Honey?
- What?

01:13:57.683 --> 01:13:59.476
I want to marry you.

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:03.522
You're a funny one.

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:06.441
Why? Why is it funny
if a guy wants to marry you?

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:11.113
Because I'm a girl you met
at the New Congress Club.

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:13.615
That's about two steps up
from the pavement.

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:17.786
Well, what am I?
I'm a private no-class dogface.

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:21.206
The way most civilians look at that,
that's two steps up from nothing.

01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:25.669
Prew, I thought we were happy.

01:14:25.753 --> 01:14:27.671
Why do you want to spoil things?

01:14:27.755 --> 01:14:30.882
Look, I've got a year to go before I reenlist.

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:35.929
If I can swing sergeant's stripes by then,
they'll let me go back to the States.

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:38.974
Then you and I can
go back there together, if you'll wait.

01:14:39.058 --> 01:14:42.394
How do you expect to become a sergeant
under that Captain Holmes of yours?

01:14:42.478 --> 01:14:44.396
It's all you can do
to keep out of the stockade.

01:14:48.067 --> 01:14:49.568
I'll fight.

01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:52.320
- No, you're not gonna fight.
- It'd be worth it.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:01.121
Prew, it's true we love each other now,

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:03.456
we need each other,

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.294
but back in the States, it might be different.

01:15:08.379 --> 01:15:10.297
That ain't the real reason.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:16.094
- All right, it's not.
- What is the real reason?

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:23.268
I won't marry you, because I don't want
to be the wife of a soldier.

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:31.943
Well, that would be about
the best I could ever do for you.

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:39.659
Because nobody's gonna
stop me from my plan. Nobody. Nothing.

01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:41.703
Because I want to be proper.

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:44.581
- Proper?
- Yes, proper.

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:48.418
In another year, I'll have
enough money saved,

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:50.629
and then I'm gonna go back
to my hometown in Oregon,

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:53.548
and I'm gonna build a house
for my mother and myself,

01:15:53.633 --> 01:15:56.343
and join the country club and take up golf.

01:15:57.136 --> 01:16:00.597
And I'll meet the proper man
with the proper position,

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:06.144
and make a proper wife who can run
a proper home and raise proper children.

01:16:06.938 --> 01:16:10.732
And I'll be happy
because when you're proper, you're safe.

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:14.945
You got guts, honey.

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:17.989
I hope you can pull it off.

01:16:26.165 --> 01:16:28.667
I do mean it when I say I need you,

01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:30.919
'cause I'm lonely.

01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:34.047
You think I'm lying, don't you?

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:38.677
Nobody ever lies about being lonely.

01:16:47.353 --> 01:16:49.688
And don't talk to me about a divorce.

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:54.192
Why? Because the scandal would spoil
your chances for a promotion?

01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:55.694
I ask you once more.

01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:57.570
I want to know who he is
and where you met him.

01:16:57.655 --> 01:16:59.197
I'm not going to tell you.

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:05.996
One thing I know. I know he's a civilian.
You'd be too discreet to pick an army man.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:09.374
I wonder which is hurt more,
your pride or your curiosity?

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.543
You can't expect to know how
I feel about a thing like this.

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:14.379
I wonder why men feel
so differently about it than women.

01:17:15.089 --> 01:17:17.007
It's just not the same.

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:24.889
It's a lovely day. I think I'll go for a walk.

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:29.060
Hey.

01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:35.483
I hear you just got out of the stockade.

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:38.611
It was rugged. I kept my mouth shut,
and I didn't get in no trouble.

01:17:38.696 --> 01:17:40.572
Did you see Maggio?

01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:42.824
Fatso's really got it in for Maggio.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:45.035
He's using a billy, too.

01:17:45.119 --> 01:17:48.830
Places where it won't show,
in the back, in the chest.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:50.915
He's got it down to a system.

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:52.584
He kicks him a lot, too.

01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:55.920
You know how Maggio's taking it?

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:59.883
He just keeps spittin' in Fatso's eye.

01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:01.926
Ain't he a hot one?

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:04.846
He's a good man.

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:08.975
Well, Fatso can't make a dent in him.

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:11.186
But that Fatso, he's smart.

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:13.313
He makes sure the O.D. Never sees nothing.

01:18:13.397 --> 01:18:15.440
Why doesn't Maggio go to the O.D. Himself?

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:17.942
We tried to get him to, but he won't peep.

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:20.195
That boy's about
the toughest nut in the woods.

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:22.530
You think he's gonna be all right, huh?

01:18:23.366 --> 01:18:26.159
- Well, maybe he's cracking, at that.
- What do you mean?

01:18:26.285 --> 01:18:29.913
After Fatso threw him in the hole,
that's solitary,

01:18:29.997 --> 01:18:33.666
he started talking a couple of times
about how he's gonna escape.

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:36.169
He said to tell you
he'll look you up one of these nights.

01:18:38.798 --> 01:18:40.924
Still on your knees, huh, Prewitt?

01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:44.636
Well, boxing finals next month.
December 15th.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:47.305
You've still got time
to help us win the championship.

01:18:50.017 --> 01:18:52.310
Are you proud to be in this company or not?

01:19:00.945 --> 01:19:02.904
I ain't gonna move around you again.

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:05.907
Something tells me
you need a lesson, Prewitt.

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:07.992
Maybe I'll give it to you myself.

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:14.582
Come on, leave him alone, Ike.
He's in my detail now.

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:16.793
You're gonna get in trouble
if you fight around here.

01:19:16.877 --> 01:19:19.170
- Get back to work, Prew.
- Get out of the way!

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:51.828
I'll be glad to put
my recommendation on that, Warden.

01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:53.997
You've got service, experience, grade.

01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:56.624
- You'll make an excellent officer.
- Thank you, sir.

01:19:56.709 --> 01:20:00.378
It'd be a feather in my cap, too.
A man from my company.

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:04.048
At ease. What's the trouble, Sergeant?

01:20:04.133 --> 01:20:07.469
They're fighting outside, sir.
Galovitch and Prewitt.

01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:08.678
Prewitt?

01:20:08.762 --> 01:20:11.222
Galovitch looks like
he's gonna murder him, sir.

01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:13.433
I'll take care of it.

01:20:17.521 --> 01:20:21.232
- Don't you want to see?
- No! Nor you, either! Get out of here!

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.242
Why don't Prew go for his head?

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:33.828
He blinded a guy once.
Must be scared of the same thing.

01:20:42.213 --> 01:20:44.172
The face, Prew! Hit him in the face!

01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:06.778
- Come on, Galovitch, fight fair!
- I'll fight any way I want!

01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:10.448
Come on, Prew! Get him!

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:45.733
Why doesn't that officer stop that fight?

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:48.319
- What's his name, Major?
- Captain Holmes, sir.

01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:17.473
Ten-hut!

01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:19.642
At ease. What started this?

01:22:19.727 --> 01:22:23.771
Prewitt refused order I gave him,
talked back and started a fight.

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:25.773
I taught him a lesson.

01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:28.234
You won't disobey
any more orders in my company, Prewitt.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:33.281
Sir, I'm sorry, sir, but Private Prewitt's not
to blame, Sergeant Galovitch started it.

01:22:33.407 --> 01:22:34.741
- Thornhill.
- Yes, sir.

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:36.826
You're in charge of this detail. What about it?

01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:38.828
He's right, sir. Prewitt done nothing.

01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:41.205
Yes, sir. Galovitch started it.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:45.668
That's all. Let's forget it.
Let's get back to our jobs.

01:22:46.879 --> 01:22:49.756
All right, back to work. Let's go. Break it up.

01:22:53.218 --> 01:22:56.471
If you guys think this means
I'm stepping into a ring, you're wrong.

01:22:56.555 --> 01:22:59.098
You'd better put some iodine on them cuts.

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:15.490
Took my dough to town Tuesday

01:23:15.574 --> 01:23:18.743
Found me a big feather bed

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:23.081
Oh, a big feather bed
A big double bed

01:23:23.165 --> 01:23:26.501
I'll find a job tomorrow

01:23:26.585 --> 01:23:29.337
Tonight I'll sleep like I'm dead

01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:34.050
I'm gonna sleep like I'm dead

01:23:34.134 --> 01:23:37.428
And get up when I choose

01:23:37.513 --> 01:23:40.682
Reenlistment blues

01:23:42.643 --> 01:23:44.185
Hey, Friday.

01:23:44.645 --> 01:23:47.105
- Why are you called Friday?
- I don't know.

01:23:47.314 --> 01:23:49.732
But I was born on a Wednesday.

01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:53.277
I hit the bars Wednesday

01:23:53.696 --> 01:23:57.865
Made me some friends on my own

01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:01.452
Lotta friends on my own

01:24:01.537 --> 01:24:04.789
Found a pretty baby

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:07.917
She couldn't leave me alone

01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:10.461
Oh, leave me alone

01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:15.508
She kept me buyin' booze

01:24:15.592 --> 01:24:21.848
Reenlistment blues

01:24:22.975 --> 01:24:25.685
I had the misery Thursday

01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:29.188
The walls was movin' I swear

01:24:29.273 --> 01:24:33.651
Oh, they was movin' I swear

01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:37.029
I reached down in my trousers

01:24:37.114 --> 01:24:39.949
And all my pockets was bare

01:24:44.163 --> 01:24:48.082
That gal was sure bad news

01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:51.002
Reenlistment blues

01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:01.304
Hey, Prewitt, where you going?

01:25:01.472 --> 01:25:03.723
What do you mean, where am I going?
I'm going to Choy's.

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:05.850
I'm gonna get me another beer.

01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:12.648
My hitch was up Monday

01:25:12.733 --> 01:25:15.610
Not a dog soldier no more

01:25:15.694 --> 01:25:19.113
I ain't a soldier no more

01:25:20.199 --> 01:25:21.491
Halt!

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:26.579
- Who goes there?
- A friend.

01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:29.165
Advance, friend, and be recognized!

01:25:39.176 --> 01:25:41.219
Ten-hut!

01:25:41.303 --> 01:25:44.138
Right face! Rear face!

01:25:44.264 --> 01:25:47.225
On your knees! Scrub the floor!

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:49.185
At ease.

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:55.858
Hello, kid.
What are you doing out here all by yourself?

01:25:58.237 --> 01:26:02.448
- I'm gonna get a little drink.
- Sit down. I got a bottle.

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:10.498
Thanks, Top.

01:26:12.251 --> 01:26:17.004
I gotta hand it to you, kid, the way you
beat up old Galovitch this afternoon.

01:26:17.089 --> 01:26:20.007
Too bad they gotta get you sooner or later.

01:26:27.975 --> 01:26:30.810
Life's crummy, you know it?

01:26:30.894 --> 01:26:34.397
Yes, sir, it's miserable. Perfectly miserable.

01:26:35.732 --> 01:26:37.149
What do you suppose would happen,

01:26:37.234 --> 01:26:40.152
if a truck was to come along
and run us over?

01:26:41.446 --> 01:26:44.991
- We'd be dead.
- You'd better not sit here anymore.

01:26:45.075 --> 01:26:47.577
You'd better get up
and sit over on the side of the road.

01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:50.371
What? What do you mean, I better?

01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:54.834
You've got more to live for than I do.
You got your whole company to take care of.

01:26:54.918 --> 01:26:56.919
You move over, move over
to the other side of the road.

01:26:57.004 --> 01:26:59.964
- Go on.
- I'm older! It don't matter if I die.

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:02.216
But you got your whole life ahead of you.
Now, don't argue.

01:27:02.301 --> 01:27:04.510
- Go on, get up.
- No, sir, not Prewitt.

01:27:04.595 --> 01:27:07.722
Prewitt stays right here to the bitter end.

01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:13.477
Okay, we'll stay together.

01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:19.984
I don't... I couldn't have got up anyway.

01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:27.325
I got the biggest troubles
in the whole world.

01:27:28.535 --> 01:27:30.494
In the whole world, huh?

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:32.413
Take love.

01:27:32.873 --> 01:27:35.917
Did you personally ever see any of this love?

01:27:36.335 --> 01:27:38.836
You'll understand what I mean.

01:27:38.921 --> 01:27:41.297
This girl, see,

01:27:41.381 --> 01:27:44.091
she wants me to become...

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:46.761
- Become what?
- An officer.

01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:49.221
Can you see me as an officer?

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:52.850
Yeah. Yeah, I can see you as an officer.

01:27:52.935 --> 01:27:57.605
- You'd be a good officer.
- Well, you both can see more than I can see.

01:27:57.689 --> 01:28:00.900
I don't wanna be an officer.
I'm happy where I am.

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:05.780
I might turn out to be a guy like Holmes.

01:28:05.864 --> 01:28:09.533
You wouldn't want me
to be a guy like Holmes, would you?

01:28:10.911 --> 01:28:12.662
Well, would you?

01:28:13.997 --> 01:28:16.624
A man should be what he can do.

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:30.012
How's your girl?

01:28:30.973 --> 01:28:32.932
What's her name again?

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:37.853
- Lorene.
- Oh, yeah, Lorene.

01:28:38.397 --> 01:28:40.022
I remember now.

01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:42.775
A beautiful name.

01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:45.027
Beautiful.

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:53.035
You two dumb, crazy screwballs!

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:55.246
What are you trying to do,
get yourself killed?

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:57.248
What are you doing
in the middle of the road?

01:28:57.332 --> 01:29:00.710
My friend Prew and I,
sittin' here discussin' the weather.

01:29:00.794 --> 01:29:02.920
- Your friend, huh?
- You heard me.

01:29:03.005 --> 01:29:05.673
Don't you know
you gotta take care of this man?

01:29:05.757 --> 01:29:09.051
Holmes is bound to get him sooner or later.

01:29:09.136 --> 01:29:11.804
And he's the best stinkin' soldier
in the whole army.

01:29:11.888 --> 01:29:14.098
You both got rocks in your head.

01:29:18.437 --> 01:29:20.646
Angelo, Angelo.

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:27.278
I figured you'd be here at Choy's.

01:29:28.613 --> 01:29:32.116
I done it, Prew. I escaped, just like I said.

01:29:32.451 --> 01:29:34.160
Just like I figured.

01:29:34.244 --> 01:29:37.329
In the back of a truck, under a tarp.

01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:41.459
They rode me right out, just like I figured.

01:29:42.419 --> 01:29:45.296
Only the tailgate opened up, Prew,
about a mile back,

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.631
and I fell out in the road.

01:29:48.759 --> 01:29:53.262
You should've seen me bounce.
I must've broke something.

01:29:56.975 --> 01:30:00.019
Prew. Prew, listen.

01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:03.606
Fatso done it, Prew.

01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:06.108
He likes to whack me in the gut.

01:30:06.193 --> 01:30:10.905
He asks me if it hurts,
and I spit at him like always.

01:30:10.989 --> 01:30:14.617
Only yesterday, it was bad.

01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:18.537
He hit me, he hit me, he hit me.

01:30:19.498 --> 01:30:23.501
I had to get out, Prew. I had to get out.

01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:25.878
Buddy, buddy.

01:30:25.962 --> 01:30:27.797
They gonna send you to the stockade, Prew?

01:30:27.881 --> 01:30:29.590
No, they ain't gonna send me
to the stockade.

01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:33.344
Watch out for Fatso.

01:30:33.428 --> 01:30:35.429
He'll try to crack you.

01:30:35.514 --> 01:30:39.141
And if they put you in the hole, don't yell.

01:30:39.684 --> 01:30:41.435
Don't make a sound.

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:45.356
You'll still be yelling
when they come to take you out.

01:30:46.525 --> 01:30:48.567
Just lay there.

01:30:48.652 --> 01:30:52.571
Just lay there and be quiet, Prew.

01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:09.046
He's dead.

01:31:39.202 --> 01:31:41.453
I'll betcha that's Prewitt.

01:34:03.930 --> 01:34:05.848
Sergeant Judson?

01:34:06.349 --> 01:34:07.891
You want me?

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:10.060
Yeah, Fatso.

01:34:10.645 --> 01:34:12.646
I don't like that nickname.

01:34:12.731 --> 01:34:15.399
You want to see me about something?

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:18.360
Let's step around the corner
where we can talk.

01:34:19.446 --> 01:34:21.071
Okay.

01:34:31.624 --> 01:34:36.003
- Are you sore about something?
- I don't like the way you play the piano.

01:34:39.090 --> 01:34:41.592
- Remember Maggio?
- Oh, the wop?

01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:43.677
Yeah, a real tough monkey.

01:34:43.762 --> 01:34:46.138
- You killed him.
- Did I?

01:34:46.222 --> 01:34:48.140
Well, if I did, he asked for it.

01:34:48.224 --> 01:34:51.310
The army's gonna get you
sooner or later, Fatso.

01:34:52.145 --> 01:34:55.147
But before they do,
I want a piece of you myself.

01:34:56.608 --> 01:34:59.193
I figured that.

01:34:59.277 --> 01:35:01.195
See this knife?

01:35:01.279 --> 01:35:03.739
It's the one you pulled on Maggio.

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:38.667
Prew!

01:36:39.752 --> 01:36:41.462
What's...

01:36:44.841 --> 01:36:46.216
Prew!

01:36:47.552 --> 01:36:49.428
It's all right.

01:36:51.890 --> 01:36:55.434
Don't worry, don't worry. I ain't gonna die.

01:37:12.994 --> 01:37:14.912
First platoon all present and accounted for!

01:37:14.996 --> 01:37:16.914
Second platoon all present
and accounted for!

01:37:16.998 --> 01:37:18.999
First platoon all present and accounted for!

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:21.001
Second platoon all present
and accounted for!

01:37:21.085 --> 01:37:23.212
Third platoon all present and accounted for!

01:37:23.296 --> 01:37:25.506
First platoon all present and accounted for!

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:28.967
Company dismissed!

01:37:33.431 --> 01:37:35.390
Prewitt's still absent.

01:37:36.518 --> 01:37:38.310
Makes three days now.

01:37:40.855 --> 01:37:43.857
How long are you gonna
carry him present, Top?

01:37:44.567 --> 01:37:47.277
- I just mention it.
- Well, don't mention it.

01:37:54.661 --> 01:37:56.578
"Upon observing these incidents,

01:37:56.663 --> 01:37:59.373
"an investigation was made
by the Inspector General's department

01:37:59.457 --> 01:38:01.708
"over a period of several months.

01:38:01.793 --> 01:38:05.420
"It was found that Captain Holmes
has been guilty of indefensible cruelty

01:38:05.505 --> 01:38:07.464
"to the aforesaid Private Prewitt.

01:38:07.882 --> 01:38:11.677
"As mentioned, this included the instigation
of wholly unauthorized tactics

01:38:11.761 --> 01:38:15.389
"to force the soldier to join
the inter-regiment boxing team."

01:38:20.436 --> 01:38:22.688
I'm waiting for your reply.

01:38:22.855 --> 01:38:24.356
I haven't any, sir.

01:38:25.233 --> 01:38:28.402
Holmes, the first thing I learned in the army

01:38:28.486 --> 01:38:31.196
was that an officer takes care of his men.

01:38:31.322 --> 01:38:34.074
It seems to be the first thing that you forgot.

01:38:34.158 --> 01:38:36.827
My only regret is that
we have to keep you in uniform

01:38:36.911 --> 01:38:38.912
until a court-martial is concluded.

01:38:38.997 --> 01:38:42.457
If there were any way
to avoid a court-martial, sir.

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:47.588
There is one alternative, General,
if you are so disposed.

01:38:47.672 --> 01:38:52.718
A resignation for the good of the service,
under army regulations.

01:38:52.802 --> 01:38:56.930
Write a letter of resignation.
Have it on my desk this afternoon.

01:38:57.015 --> 01:38:58.932
As far as I'm concerned,

01:38:59.017 --> 01:39:01.893
the quicker you're out of the army,
the better for everybody,

01:39:01.978 --> 01:39:04.021
especially the army.

01:39:05.523 --> 01:39:07.774
That's all, Holmes.

01:39:14.741 --> 01:39:17.200
I know what's been going on in this outfit.

01:39:17.285 --> 01:39:19.661
I know how far some of you
have been out of line.

01:39:19.746 --> 01:39:22.998
If you want to remain noncoms,
you'd better snap into it.

01:39:23.082 --> 01:39:25.459
And another thing, from now on,

01:39:25.543 --> 01:39:28.211
no man's gonna earn his stripes by boxing.

01:39:30.715 --> 01:39:33.133
- Get rid of those.
- Yes, sir.

01:39:33.217 --> 01:39:35.135
Dismissed.

01:39:40.725 --> 01:39:42.976
- About Sergeant Galovitch.
- Yes, sir.

01:39:43.061 --> 01:39:45.812
Bust him.
Sergeant Galovitch is now Private Galovitch.

01:39:45.897 --> 01:39:48.148
Put him in charge of the latrine.

01:39:48.232 --> 01:39:50.150
What are you grinning at?

01:39:50.234 --> 01:39:52.944
I think the company commander
made a wise decision, sir.

01:39:55.907 --> 01:39:57.908
Company "G," Captain Ross.

01:39:59.744 --> 01:40:03.080
- Just a minute. It's for you, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.

01:40:06.542 --> 01:40:08.585
Yes, sir?

01:40:10.254 --> 01:40:13.507
Yes, the parcel has already arrived.

01:40:14.801 --> 01:40:16.009
What?

01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:18.929
I've got to see you, Milt. It's important.

01:40:22.183 --> 01:40:26.103
Okay, I'll get away somehow.
Sure, that'd be fine.

01:40:26.187 --> 01:40:29.606
Yeah. I'll be there in about an hour.

01:40:29.691 --> 01:40:30.982
Right.

01:40:34.195 --> 01:40:36.321
He's being sent back to the States.
He's sailing next week.

01:40:36.406 --> 01:40:39.449
He wants me to go with him. What'll we do?

01:40:41.577 --> 01:40:44.162
When do you think
you'll get your commission?

01:40:47.625 --> 01:40:49.418
I didn't put it in.

01:40:49.585 --> 01:40:51.670
I filled it out, but I didn't sign it.

01:40:51.838 --> 01:40:55.674
I took it out of my desk a dozen times,
but I couldn't sign it.

01:40:56.342 --> 01:40:57.718
Why?

01:40:59.011 --> 01:41:00.971
But it was the plan.

01:41:01.055 --> 01:41:03.390
- I know, I know.
- It's been weeks.

01:41:03.474 --> 01:41:05.684
You can't just say you'll do a thing
and then not do it.

01:41:05.768 --> 01:41:07.060
Karen, listen to me.

01:41:07.145 --> 01:41:09.980
But why didn't you do it?
Why didn't you tell me?

01:41:11.441 --> 01:41:13.483
Be back in a minute.

01:41:16.112 --> 01:41:18.822
I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else.

01:41:24.579 --> 01:41:28.665
I thought it was a guy from our company,
Prewitt, the kid I was telling you about.

01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:31.543
The one that got mixed up with
one of the girls at the New Congress Club.

01:41:31.627 --> 01:41:34.963
He's A.W.O.L. Probably in lots of trouble.

01:41:35.047 --> 01:41:37.883
Robert E. Lee Prewitt, a crazy, no good...

01:41:41.095 --> 01:41:44.681
Karen, I'm no officer. I'm an enlisted man.

01:41:44.766 --> 01:41:45.891
I can't be anything else.

01:41:45.975 --> 01:41:48.185
If I try to be an officer,
I'll be putting on an act.

01:41:48.269 --> 01:41:51.188
I just can't do it. Please don't ask me why.

01:41:53.816 --> 01:41:56.234
I know why.

01:41:56.319 --> 01:41:58.403
You don't have to become
an officer now, Milt,

01:41:58.488 --> 01:42:01.031
now that Dana's out of the army.

01:42:01.115 --> 01:42:03.658
You just don't want to marry me.

01:42:03.743 --> 01:42:06.411
You're already married to the army.

01:42:06.496 --> 01:42:08.497
I love you, Karen.

01:42:13.586 --> 01:42:15.712
I know. I know.

01:42:18.049 --> 01:42:19.966
I don't want you to go back to Holmes.

01:42:20.051 --> 01:42:22.427
I don't want to either, but I am.

01:42:22.553 --> 01:42:25.138
There's nothing else for me to do.

01:42:25.264 --> 01:42:28.141
It's no good with us, Milt.
It could never have been any good.

01:42:28.226 --> 01:42:30.310
Hiding and sneaking.

01:42:30.394 --> 01:42:32.354
It had to wear out.

01:42:35.608 --> 01:42:37.567
Goodbye, Sergeant.

01:42:38.236 --> 01:42:40.821
- Thanks.
- It ain't goodbye. It's...

01:42:42.031 --> 01:42:44.616
We'll see each other again somewhere.

01:42:45.576 --> 01:42:47.452
Of course we will.

01:42:47.829 --> 01:42:49.663
Somewhere.

01:43:03.553 --> 01:43:07.889
Here it is. Got it on an inside page already.

01:43:07.974 --> 01:43:13.061
"Still no clue in the fatal stabbing
of Staff Sergeant James R. Judson."

01:43:13.145 --> 01:43:15.272
Did you hear me?

01:43:18.776 --> 01:43:22.153
- Trying to set a new world's record?
- Yeah.

01:43:22.947 --> 01:43:25.615
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.

01:43:26.117 --> 01:43:29.369
To the memory of Robert E. Lee Prewitt,

01:43:29.453 --> 01:43:32.539
holder of the new world's record.

01:43:50.975 --> 01:43:52.851
- Everything all right, Top?
- Great.

01:43:53.936 --> 01:43:56.396
This is a beautiful meal
to put in front of a guy on a Sunday morning.

01:43:57.398 --> 01:43:59.316
Congratulations.

01:44:13.164 --> 01:44:16.666
- Sure look pretty over them mountains.
- Don't they, though?

01:44:26.135 --> 01:44:28.762
Sounds like they're dynamiting
down at Wheeler Field.

01:44:28.846 --> 01:44:33.308
Mighty ambitious, huh?
Sunday morning before 8:00?

01:44:44.946 --> 01:44:48.406
The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!

01:44:48.491 --> 01:44:50.825
I seen the red circles on the...

01:45:22.066 --> 01:45:24.693
Come on, get inside! Hurry up! Go!

01:45:28.823 --> 01:45:33.451
This is a real attack, not a maneuver.
The Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor.

01:45:33.536 --> 01:45:37.497
Please keep in your homes.
Do not go on the streets. This is a real attack.

01:45:37.581 --> 01:45:40.875
Japanese planes are bombing our naval
and army installations.

01:45:42.503 --> 01:45:44.587
All right, all right, you guys, quiet down.

01:45:44.672 --> 01:45:46.589
Quiet! Quiet down!

01:45:46.674 --> 01:45:49.926
Noncoms, get B.A.R.S
and ammunition from the supply room.

01:45:50.011 --> 01:45:51.886
- Get up on the roof. Henderson.
- Right here, Sarge.

01:45:51.971 --> 01:45:53.972
You're in charge of the loading detail.
Get moving.

01:45:54.056 --> 01:45:55.390
Wilson, Dole, let's go.

01:45:55.474 --> 01:45:57.392
The rest of you men, listen to me.

01:45:57.476 --> 01:45:59.936
I want every man to get his rifle,
go to his bunk and stay there.

01:46:00.021 --> 01:46:01.354
And I mean stay there!

01:46:03.607 --> 01:46:04.983
Shut up!

01:46:05.651 --> 01:46:07.736
You'll get your ears shot off
if you go outside.

01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:09.738
You wanna be heroes,
you'll get plenty of chances.

01:46:09.822 --> 01:46:11.781
There'll probably be Japs
in your lap before night.

01:46:11.866 --> 01:46:14.075
Now get moving. We're wasting time.

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:16.411
Hey, come on. Hurry up.

01:46:17.455 --> 01:46:19.539
Wait. Into the kitchen
and make a pot of coffee.

01:46:19.623 --> 01:46:22.292
- Wait a minute. A barrel of coffee!
- Right, Sarge!

01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:44.230
I don't care.
I can't issue any live ammunitions

01:46:44.315 --> 01:46:45.565
without a signed order from an officer.

01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:47.484
- But the captain ain't here, you jerk!
- I'm sorry.

01:46:47.610 --> 01:46:49.444
- No order, no ammo.
- What's the matter, Leva?

01:46:49.612 --> 01:46:52.489
I got my orders!
Army regulations say that I can't give out...

01:46:57.995 --> 01:46:59.621
What's the matter, are you blind?
Give me them keys!

01:46:59.705 --> 01:47:00.789
I obey my orders, Top.

01:47:00.873 --> 01:47:02.874
Okay, I'll see you get a medal!
Bust it down, boys!

01:47:02.958 --> 01:47:04.876
I warned ya!

01:47:28.234 --> 01:47:30.151
Don't go out there, Warden! You'll get killed!

01:47:30.236 --> 01:47:32.946
Put your pants on. You'll catch cold!

01:47:59.431 --> 01:48:02.600
Give him a hand with this ammo.
Put that stuff over there.

01:48:08.941 --> 01:48:11.234
Watch your fire, boys,
and lead those planes!

01:48:32.131 --> 01:48:34.716
Friday's gone crazy!
He's blowing the cavalry charge!

01:48:37.928 --> 01:48:39.387
Here they come, boys!

01:49:11.462 --> 01:49:13.588
You got him, Pete! You got him!

01:49:13.797 --> 01:49:15.340
I got him?

01:49:23.724 --> 01:49:26.309
The danger of an invasion
continues to exist.

01:49:26.435 --> 01:49:29.520
Infantry units from Schofield Barracks
moved out within a few hours

01:49:29.605 --> 01:49:31.731
and have manned beach positions.

01:49:31.815 --> 01:49:35.443
This is no maneuver. This is the real McCoy.

01:49:35.527 --> 01:49:38.905
Look out for falling shrapnel.
Keep under cover.

01:49:38.989 --> 01:49:42.659
Blackout and curfew restrictions
will be rigidly enforced.

01:49:42.743 --> 01:49:45.495
Stay in your homes. Don't use the telephone.

01:49:46.997 --> 01:49:48.915
Rest assured that immediate relay to you...

01:49:48.999 --> 01:49:52.585
Prew! We've been to Queen's Hospital
giving blood.

01:49:52.670 --> 01:49:53.878
The town's a madhouse.

01:49:53.963 --> 01:49:55.964
There's a big house bombed out
on Kuhio Street.

01:49:56.048 --> 01:49:58.675
And the drugstore down
on McCully and King is smashed flat.

01:49:58.759 --> 01:50:02.095
- Man and his wife were killed.
- Your attention, please.

01:50:02.179 --> 01:50:04.889
Listen to this carefully and keep calm.

01:50:04.974 --> 01:50:08.434
The danger of an invasion continues to exist,

01:50:08.519 --> 01:50:12.230
and the planes have been
identified as Japanese.

01:50:12.940 --> 01:50:14.983
Who do they think they're fighting?

01:50:15.442 --> 01:50:18.987
They're picking trouble
with the best army in the world.

01:50:20.281 --> 01:50:21.531
Where are you going?

01:50:22.574 --> 01:50:25.743
I gotta get back.
I gotta get back to the company.

01:50:25.828 --> 01:50:29.956
- The company? But why?
- Why?

01:50:30.207 --> 01:50:33.042
But you can't. You're not well yet.

01:50:33.585 --> 01:50:36.629
Besides, you're A.W.O.L.
They'll throw you in the stockade.

01:50:36.714 --> 01:50:38.715
They'll be throwing them out of the stockade.

01:50:38.882 --> 01:50:41.718
- They need every guy they can get.
- But your side'll open up.

01:50:41.802 --> 01:50:44.679
They'll find out it was you
who killed that soldier.

01:50:44.763 --> 01:50:48.057
Once I report in to the company,
they'll take care of me.

01:50:48.183 --> 01:50:49.976
I'll be all right once I get back.

01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:53.438
But you'll never make it!
There's patrols all over!

01:50:53.522 --> 01:50:56.607
I'll make it. I know a shortcut.

01:50:58.902 --> 01:51:01.070
Prew, stay till morning.

01:51:01.155 --> 01:51:03.906
Maybe if you stay till morning,
you'll change your mind.

01:51:11.415 --> 01:51:13.333
Oh, Prew, don't go!

01:51:13.417 --> 01:51:15.501
I'll do anything you want.

01:51:15.586 --> 01:51:20.006
We can go back to the States together.
We can even get married.

01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:26.721
If you go now,
I'll never see you again, I know it.

01:51:26.805 --> 01:51:28.598
I'm sorry.

01:51:33.937 --> 01:51:36.356
What do you want to go back
to the army for?

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:39.192
What did the army ever
do for you besides treat you like dirt

01:51:39.276 --> 01:51:42.862
and give you one awful going-over
and get your friend killed?

01:51:42.946 --> 01:51:45.406
What do you want to go back to the army for?

01:51:45.491 --> 01:51:48.201
What do I want to go back to the army for?
I'm a soldier.

01:51:48.285 --> 01:51:50.286
A soldier? A soldier?

01:51:50.371 --> 01:51:54.082
A regular! From the regular army!
A 30-year man!

01:51:56.126 --> 01:52:00.171
I gotta turn off the lights
'cause of the blackout outside.

01:52:13.811 --> 01:52:16.521
They say they've seen parachutists
land up in the hills.

01:52:16.605 --> 01:52:19.982
I ain't worried about them.
Saboteurs is what worries me.

01:52:20.067 --> 01:52:22.985
Yeah. I bet they're operating
all over these islands.

01:53:36.477 --> 01:53:54.243
Halt!

01:54:07.257 --> 01:54:10.801
My hitch was up Monday

01:54:10.886 --> 01:54:14.555
Not a dog soldier no more

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:18.601
Soldier no more

01:54:19.937 --> 01:54:23.856
They give me all that money

01:54:23.941 --> 01:54:27.693
So much my pockets is sore

01:54:30.531 --> 01:54:32.698
Do you know this man, Sergeant?

01:54:32.783 --> 01:54:34.700
Yes, sir.

01:54:34.785 --> 01:54:36.911
He didn't have any regular identification.

01:54:36.995 --> 01:54:39.497
They found a card on him with his name.

01:54:39.581 --> 01:54:41.707
Seems to be a membership in a club.

01:54:41.792 --> 01:54:43.876
- The New Congress Club.
- Yes, sir.

01:54:43.961 --> 01:54:46.128
You'd better take care of these, Sergeant.

01:54:50.634 --> 01:54:53.511
- Was this man a friend of yours?
- Yes, sir.

01:54:53.595 --> 01:54:56.347
He must've been trying to reach our
company position up the beach here.

01:54:56.431 --> 01:54:57.890
Then why didn't he halt?

01:54:57.975 --> 01:55:01.060
He was always a hardhead, sir,
but he was a good soldier.

01:55:01.144 --> 01:55:03.938
He loved the army
more than any soldier I ever knew.

01:55:04.064 --> 01:55:07.817
I see. I'm sorry, Sergeant.

01:55:23.125 --> 01:55:25.793
You just couldn't play it smart, could you?

01:55:26.295 --> 01:55:30.006
All you had to do was box.
But no, not you, you hardhead.

01:55:31.216 --> 01:55:35.094
Funny thing is, there ain't gonna be
any boxing championships this year.

01:55:42.519 --> 01:55:44.895
What's the matter with you?
Ain't you ever seen a dead man?

01:55:45.022 --> 01:55:48.149
Let's get this body outta here!
We ain't got all night!

01:56:10.172 --> 01:56:12.131
It's very beautiful, isn't it?

01:56:16.386 --> 01:56:20.139
I think it's the most beautiful place
I ever saw in my life.

01:56:21.558 --> 01:56:24.310
I can almost see where I worked from here.

01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:30.232
There's a legend.

01:56:31.526 --> 01:56:35.655
If they float in toward shore,
you'll come back someday.

01:56:36.073 --> 01:56:38.074
If they float out to sea, you won't.

01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:45.498
I won't come back.

01:56:47.125 --> 01:56:51.087
You see, my fiancÃ© was
killed on December 7th.

01:56:51.171 --> 01:56:53.214
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:56:53.423 --> 01:56:55.800
He was a bomber pilot.

01:56:55.884 --> 01:56:58.928
He tried to taxi his plane
to the edge of the apron,

01:56:59.012 --> 01:57:02.348
and the Japs made a direct hit on it.

01:57:02.432 --> 01:57:05.518
Maybe you read about it in the papers.

01:57:05.602 --> 01:57:08.270
He was awarded the silver star.

01:57:08.897 --> 01:57:11.148
They sent it to his mother.

01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:13.484
She wrote me she wanted me to have it.

01:57:14.152 --> 01:57:16.153
That's very fine of her.

01:57:17.114 --> 01:57:20.116
They're very fine people. Southern people.

01:57:20.951 --> 01:57:23.869
He was named after a general.

01:57:23.954 --> 01:57:27.623
Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

01:57:29.584 --> 01:57:30.793
Who?

01:57:32.212 --> 01:57:35.464
Robert E. Lee Prewitt.
