aren't we, Lee?

34:17.222 --> 34:21.184
[GASPS] Oh, I will
get started right away.

34:22.227 --> 34:24.103
Ooh...

34:25.438 --> 34:27.148
Bounce.

34:27.148 --> 34:30.652
Bounce. Good boy.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.362
Playing fetch
is his favorite thing,

34:32.362 --> 34:34.031
well, next to eating.

34:34.031 --> 34:35.281
[LAUGHTER]

34:35.281 --> 34:37.701
I guess that's it.

34:37.701 --> 34:40.787
Thank you, Cody.
And thank you, Dasher.

34:40.787 --> 34:45.042
All right, let's see...
who do we have next? Chad.

34:45.042 --> 34:47.753
Did you bring something
for show-and-tell?

34:47.753 --> 34:49.295
[MUTTERS] Who cares?

34:54.885 --> 34:57.262
You said we should
bring something special,

34:57.262 --> 35:01.516
so I brought this--
it's a recorder.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.602
Kind of like a flute.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.854
And can you tell us why
that's special to you?

35:05.854 --> 35:08.023
It was a Christmas present

35:08.023 --> 35:11.985
from my mother.

35:11.985 --> 35:14.821
My brother got one, too.

35:14.821 --> 35:16.865
Will you play it for us?

35:16.865 --> 35:19.618
I don't know how.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.913
Our mom was supposed to
teach us, but...

35:25.290 --> 35:28.251
[♪♪♪]

35:28.251 --> 35:30.087
Earl?

35:39.054 --> 35:41.056
Don't know what
the big rush is.

35:41.056 --> 35:42.808
We got a long ride
ahead of us.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.768
That's not my fault.

35:44.768 --> 35:47.062
Was there a reason you buried
the ledgers ten miles away?

35:47.062 --> 35:48.855
It was a nice day
for a ride.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.857
Get on.

35:53.359 --> 35:55.570
Hyah.
Hey. Hey.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.868
[GUNSHOT]
Whoa. Whoa.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.745
Ow.

36:07.082 --> 36:09.709
Was that really necessary?
It was worth a try.

36:09.709 --> 36:12.004
Try it again,
and you go to jail. Got that?

36:12.004 --> 36:14.047
Got it.

36:14.047 --> 36:16.133
Good.

36:16.133 --> 36:19.594
[♪♪♪]

36:19.594 --> 36:21.596
I'm so sorry your mother
never had a chance

36:21.596 --> 36:23.598
to teach you how to play
the recorder.

36:23.598 --> 36:25.017
Me too.

36:25.017 --> 36:26.643
But I'm sure
there's someone here in town

36:26.643 --> 36:28.645
who could teach you
how to play. Earl too.

36:28.645 --> 36:31.481
Earl doesn't have his anymore.
Why not?

36:31.481 --> 36:35.485
He threw it out after my mom
left. He was really mad at her.

36:35.485 --> 36:37.320
Left?

36:37.320 --> 36:40.991
I thought she passed.

36:40.991 --> 36:43.660
She's still alive.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.411
But-But Earl said...

36:45.411 --> 36:46.746
It's not true.

36:46.746 --> 36:50.167
[SIGHS] Why would he
lie about that?

36:50.167 --> 36:54.004
I don't know. My mom and dad
used to fight a lot.

36:54.004 --> 36:57.507
I-I don't remember too well
because I was little.

36:57.507 --> 36:59.467
[♪♪♪]

37:02.512 --> 37:05.223
How'd Avery
find out about AJ Foster?

37:05.223 --> 37:06.558
It doesn't matter.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.393
I've sent Dale
to take care of it.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.103
How?

37:10.103 --> 37:12.564
Do you have to ask?

37:12.564 --> 37:14.566
I don't know
that I feel comfortable

37:14.566 --> 37:16.317
with an extreme solution.

37:16.317 --> 37:19.362
You were comfortable
embezzling.

37:19.362 --> 37:21.614
You were comfortable
asking me to cover it up.

37:21.614 --> 37:24.534
It's a little late
to develop a guilty conscience.

37:24.534 --> 37:25.869
I don't think...

37:25.869 --> 37:27.704
That's right, you don't.

37:27.704 --> 37:29.664
With Avery
out of the way,

37:29.664 --> 37:31.457
you and I are gonna own
Hope Valley.

37:31.457 --> 37:35.837
And it's gonna be
a very profitable partnership...

37:35.837 --> 37:37.964
as long as you do
as you're told.

37:42.886 --> 37:45.097
I don't know much
about what happened,

37:45.097 --> 37:47.515
just that Chad said
his mom and dad argued a lot.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.350
And then she left?

37:49.350 --> 37:51.603
Mm-hmm. I think it was
a lot harder on Earl.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.438
He was old enough
to remember.

37:53.438 --> 37:55.023
No wonder he's angry.

37:55.023 --> 37:57.109
I'm never gonna be able to
get through to those boys

37:57.109 --> 37:58.777
without their father's help.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.029
I thought you said
he was out of town.

38:01.029 --> 38:04.365
He is,
but this can't wait.

38:04.365 --> 38:07.244
I'm gonna send him
a telegram.

38:07.244 --> 38:09.537
Oh, Ray Wyatt may not
like you getting involved

38:09.537 --> 38:11.456
in his family's
private business.

38:11.456 --> 38:14.459

Ray Wyatt likes or dislikes.

That's wonderful.

There you go.
And don't worry.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.177
I know all about the meeting
with Dottie tomorrow

39:05.177 --> 39:06.845
about working
in the dress shop,

39:06.845 --> 39:09.306
but I will be there with you
every step of the way,

you need me to testify?

once you have the ledgers...
