WEBVTT

00:00.115 --> 00:02.182
Previously on "Heartland":

00:02.250 --> 00:03.750
What are you doing here?

00:03.817 --> 00:06.186
How come you're not picking up
or returning my calls?

00:06.254 --> 00:07.387
Don't you think the guest room

00:07.455 --> 00:09.189
would make the perfect nursery?

00:09.257 --> 00:11.024
Well, no, actually, I don't.

00:11.959 --> 00:13.360
Caleb odell,

00:13.428 --> 00:16.763
would you be
my lawfully wedded husband?

00:16.830 --> 00:18.297
I will.

00:18.365 --> 00:21.534
One game, you and me.
Five thousand bus.S.

00:23.970 --> 00:25.104
Yes!

00:25.172 --> 00:27.139
Shut up and take the money,
all right?

00:27.207 --> 00:28.240
We're partners.

00:28.308 --> 00:29.741
Pay off some of that debt.

00:29.809 --> 00:30.943
Thanks, man.

00:31.945 --> 00:34.512
Well, you know
how I feel about the...

00:34.580 --> 00:36.347
T n nursery.

00:36.415 --> 00:38.149
Well, I figured
you'd keep on me

00:38.217 --> 00:40.085
until you got
what you wanted anyway, so.

00:40.152 --> 00:41.386
Oh, thank you!

00:42.988 --> 00:43.988
Careful!

00:44.056 --> 00:45.390
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:45.458 --> 00:46.624
Okay.

00:46.692 --> 00:47.992
W-watch the door there.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.127
Now, Caleb,
lower on the left side there.

00:50.195 --> 00:51.562
Whose left, Lou?

00:51.629 --> 00:52.629
Okay, watch the door frame,
grandpa!

00:52.697 --> 00:54.064
You're gonna scratch the wood.

00:54.132 --> 00:55.932
Now, both of you could
twist it a little bit.

00:56.000 --> 00:56.967
A little more...

00:57.034 --> 00:58.502
Lou, please!

00:58.570 --> 01:01.105
This whole exercise is crazy.

01:01.172 --> 01:03.107
I don't know why I let myself
get talked into it!

01:03.174 --> 01:05.141
Okay, just careful
on the stairs there.

01:05.209 --> 01:07.110
Excuse me, Lou.
Sorry.

01:07.177 --> 01:08.511
Where are you going?
I thought you were gonna help!

01:08.579 --> 01:10.213
I've got stuff to do.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.014
So "stuff" is more important
than your role

01:12.082 --> 01:13.549
as a future aunt?

01:15.519 --> 01:16.719
- Hey, mom!
- Hey, sweetheart!

01:16.786 --> 01:18.254
I'm so glad you're here.

01:18.322 --> 01:19.355
I've gotta run over
some wedding details with you.

01:19.423 --> 01:21.023
I'm actually just on my way out.

01:21.091 --> 01:23.024
Well, honey,
I've gotta talk to you

01:23.092 --> 01:24.192
because it's countdown time.

01:24.260 --> 01:25.793
It's only a month away!

01:25.861 --> 01:27.195
The polo club needs
dinner numbers,

01:27.263 --> 01:28.997
so we have got to finalize
the guest list.

01:29.064 --> 01:31.233
I'm sorry, I can't right now.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.669
Ashley, have you at least
picked your bridesmaids?

01:34.737 --> 01:36.204
Look.

01:36.272 --> 01:37.838
I'm really happy that
you're helping me with this,

01:37.905 --> 01:40.274
but I already told you
no bridesmaids,

01:40.342 --> 01:41.675
and Caleb doesn't want
a best man.

01:41.743 --> 01:42.676
Oh...

01:42.744 --> 01:44.578
Okay?
So don't worry!

01:44.646 --> 01:45.812
I love you!

01:45.880 --> 01:46.947
Yeah.

01:48.550 --> 01:49.883
Hey, val.

01:51.052 --> 01:52.719
Honest to God...

01:54.688 --> 01:56.789
Sometimes I think this wedding
isn't worth the time,

01:56.857 --> 01:58.291
the money, or the effort!

02:02.729 --> 02:05.331
How are you?
How's school going?

02:05.399 --> 02:06.866
It's going.

02:08.935 --> 02:11.002
What're you doing
with that rock?

02:12.138 --> 02:13.905
I'm building a fire pit.

02:13.973 --> 02:16.375
It's gonna be awesome!

02:17.710 --> 02:19.511
Lou, would you like some help?

02:19.579 --> 02:21.880
I am pregnant, not broken.

02:21.947 --> 02:22.881
Ungh!

02:22.948 --> 02:24.316
Okay, it's too heavy.

02:24.384 --> 02:27.151
God, what's in that box, lead?

02:29.555 --> 02:32.089
Grandpa,
don't make that face.

02:32.157 --> 02:33.457
Come on.

02:33.525 --> 02:35.159
We agreed
this was a good idea.

02:35.227 --> 02:37.195
Whoa! Look at this!

02:39.498 --> 02:42.232
Best all around cowboy,
ponoka stampede!

02:42.333 --> 02:43.633
Okay, Caleb, come on.

02:43.701 --> 02:44.801
Drool over it
on the front lawn.

02:44.868 --> 02:45.802
Let's go.

02:45.869 --> 02:46.936
Yes, ma'am.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.848 --> 03:00.048
Hello?

03:00.116 --> 03:01.183
Hey, Lisa.

03:03.186 --> 03:05.454
Hey, grandpa,
Lisa's on the phone.

03:05.522 --> 03:07.590
She wants to know
if you got your ticket yet?

03:07.657 --> 03:10.125
What ticket?
Tell her I'll call her back.

03:10.193 --> 03:11.360
Okay...

03:11.428 --> 03:12.628
Yeah, he's in the middle
of something.

03:12.696 --> 03:14.862
He's in the middle
of being a huge grump!

03:26.442 --> 03:27.908
Well, if it isn't Dexter,

03:27.976 --> 03:29.909
the racehorse
that doesn't race.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.712
Would you just give it a rest,
dad?

03:31.779 --> 03:33.447
The show jumper.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.482
I'll let it go.
Don't worry.

03:35.550 --> 03:36.483
I've totally let it go.

03:36.551 --> 03:38.885
It's all water under the bridge.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.688
Water under the freaking bridge.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.331
Good job.
Thanks.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.066
What's with all
the lawn furniture?

03:54.134 --> 03:56.435
Ah, well, Lou's taking over
mom's old room.

03:56.503 --> 03:59.004
She's turning it
into a nursery.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.039
Aw, that's so cute!

04:01.107 --> 04:02.707
Yeah, I know it makes
total sense,

04:02.775 --> 04:04.542
but it doesn't make it
easy to watch.

04:04.610 --> 04:07.044
Pregnancy's made her
a little bit crazy...

04:07.112 --> 04:08.212
more so than usual.

04:08.281 --> 04:10.682
Yeah, my mom's gone crazy too.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.317
I know she felt cheated
the first time around,

04:12.385 --> 04:13.752
but now it's out of control.

04:13.819 --> 04:16.688
I mean, 50 guests have
turned into a 150 guests!

04:16.755 --> 04:18.689
That's a nightmare;
You guys should just elope.

04:18.757 --> 04:21.558
Been there, done that,
didn’t work.

04:21.625 --> 04:24.261
So... how is that going,

04:24.329 --> 04:25.996
the three of you
all shoved into a trailer?

04:26.063 --> 04:27.097
Oh my God.

04:27.165 --> 04:28.799
Those boys are
driving me crazy.

04:28.866 --> 04:31.568
It's about time
Ty got his own place.

04:31.636 --> 04:32.969
You guys should just
patch things up

04:33.037 --> 04:34.870
and get back together.

04:34.938 --> 04:37.473
Been there, done that,
didn't work.

04:37.541 --> 04:38.608
Yeah.

04:40.644 --> 04:43.780
Wow! I wondered
where this went.

04:43.847 --> 04:46.115
All around cowboy,
ponoka stampede.

04:46.183 --> 04:48.618
That was my first big win.

04:48.686 --> 04:50.719
First of many, right, Jack?

04:51.654 --> 04:54.790
Yep, I guess Marion
kept it all these years.

04:54.857 --> 04:56.358
Well, she was pretty
damn proud.

04:56.426 --> 04:57.726
Yeah, so damn proud

04:57.794 --> 05:00.696
she stuck it in
the back of her closet.

05:00.763 --> 05:02.464
There's a screw loose.

05:02.532 --> 05:03.932
There's a trophy place
in town, you know.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.966
Maybe I should get this thing
fixed up.

05:06.034 --> 05:07.935
Oh, I know a guy
who fixes those things.

05:08.002 --> 05:09.470
Yeah, he'll make it look
brand new,

05:09.538 --> 05:11.972
and well, it'll cost you half
of what it costs in town.

05:13.442 --> 05:14.608
Okay.

05:14.676 --> 05:16.176
You got the job.

05:16.244 --> 05:19.046
1985!
I wasn't even born yet.

05:20.649 --> 05:21.981
Yeah.
Get it done right,

05:22.049 --> 05:24.217
or you're gonna wish
you weren't born at all.

05:24.284 --> 05:26.353
Yes, sir.

06:12.963 --> 06:14.765
Whoa! Look at that.

06:14.832 --> 06:18.167
Your grandma Lyndy's
guitar case.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.837
Wow!

06:20.905 --> 06:23.106
It's looking so big!
It's gonna be amazing.

06:23.173 --> 06:24.340
Thank you!

06:24.409 --> 06:26.675
Finally,
somebody who sees my vision.

06:26.743 --> 06:27.843
Well, you didn't call me black.

06:27.911 --> 06:28.977
Yeah, sorry.

06:29.045 --> 06:30.646
I got kinda busy doing things.

06:30.714 --> 06:31.881
Somebody decided

06:31.948 --> 06:34.149
to turn my entire household
upside down.

06:34.217 --> 06:35.317
See?

06:35.385 --> 06:36.619
Have you booked your flight?

06:36.686 --> 06:39.254
No, I haven't gotten around
to that either,

06:39.322 --> 06:40.355
but I will.

06:40.424 --> 06:42.457
What flight?
To France.

06:42.558 --> 06:43.792
Paris.

06:43.859 --> 06:45.527
Paris?

06:45.594 --> 06:46.661
Grandpa?

06:48.864 --> 06:51.800
I can't believe
you haven't told anyone.

06:51.867 --> 06:53.535
Why don't you just
let me book it.

06:53.602 --> 06:55.369
No, no, I'll do it.

06:55.438 --> 06:56.604
I'll just go into town,

06:56.672 --> 06:58.472
and I'll go to the travel agent,
and...

06:58.573 --> 07:00.140
You don't have to go
to the travel agent,

07:00.207 --> 07:01.842
you can book it online
in five minutes.

07:01.910 --> 07:03.477
And I will.

07:03.545 --> 07:04.778
Well, I leave next week,

07:04.846 --> 07:06.046
you said you were coming
the week after that.

07:06.113 --> 07:07.113
So that's two weeks.

07:07.181 --> 07:08.114
I know!

07:08.182 --> 07:09.115
Here, grandpa,

07:09.183 --> 07:10.951
got another one for you.

07:13.020 --> 07:14.086
Thanks.

07:15.288 --> 07:16.388
Hey, listen.

07:16.457 --> 07:17.957
Don't let him get to you, okay?

07:18.024 --> 07:19.325
You know how he hates change.

07:19.392 --> 07:22.094
Yes, apparently as much
as he hates flying.

07:22.162 --> 07:23.529
Yeah.
He's a real catch.

07:23.597 --> 07:25.598
He's my catch.

07:29.269 --> 07:30.735
Whoa, man!

07:30.803 --> 07:32.136
A fire pit?

07:32.204 --> 07:33.572
Damn straight!

07:33.639 --> 07:34.739
That's awesome!

07:34.807 --> 07:36.074
I've always wanted a fire pit!

07:38.544 --> 07:39.978
Let's get 'er lit!

07:41.647 --> 07:43.114
So, how is Ty?

07:44.049 --> 07:45.049
Miserable.

07:45.117 --> 07:46.416
Did he say something?

07:46.485 --> 07:49.887
No, it's just, you know,
he's not himself.

07:49.955 --> 07:51.021
You should call him...

07:51.089 --> 07:52.122
And I'm not just saying that

07:52.190 --> 07:53.090
because I want him
out of our trailer,

07:53.157 --> 07:55.359
although that would be a plus.

07:55.426 --> 07:56.426
You should just call him.

07:56.495 --> 07:57.628
No.
I already told you,

07:57.696 --> 07:59.062
it's not gonna happen.
Oh, come on.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.931
You two need each other.
Ashley!

08:00.999 --> 08:02.899
People shouldn't be together
'cause they need each other.

08:02.967 --> 08:05.267
They should be together
'cause they want to be together.

08:05.335 --> 08:08.304
You two are just so stubborn!

08:08.372 --> 08:10.974
Can I do anything?
Tell him anything?

08:11.041 --> 08:13.776
No. No, I'm...
I'm busy, I'm fine.

08:15.145 --> 08:18.279
You know, I'm more than fine.

08:18.347 --> 08:19.781
Thank you.

08:19.849 --> 08:20.916
Bye.

08:39.868 --> 08:43.270
This is heaven;
that's what this is.

08:43.337 --> 08:45.304
Yeah, this is pretty damn good.

08:45.372 --> 08:47.841
Yeah. But hey,
you know...

08:47.909 --> 08:48.875
Don't feel like you gotta keep

08:48.943 --> 08:50.476
doing stuff like this for us.

08:50.545 --> 08:53.112
I mean, heck,
you've done enough.

08:53.180 --> 08:56.315
That money?
Came in real handy.

08:58.719 --> 09:00.452
Yeah, um...

09:00.520 --> 09:02.721
I'd rather Amy didn't know
about that.

09:02.789 --> 09:05.090
Yeah. It's no problem.

09:06.026 --> 09:07.092
Cool.

09:10.564 --> 09:12.765
How's she doing, by the way?

09:12.832 --> 09:14.900
Oh, Amy...

09:14.968 --> 09:16.568
She's fine, you know.

09:16.635 --> 09:17.835
Typical Amy,

09:17.903 --> 09:19.704
working with Dexter
and spartan,

09:19.772 --> 09:21.806
bunch of client's horses.

09:21.874 --> 09:23.908
Yeah, she's good.

09:27.245 --> 09:29.747
Hey, baby!
You want a weenie?

09:30.683 --> 09:33.684
Um, Caleb,
can I talk to you inside?

09:36.788 --> 09:39.289
You're in trouble.

09:41.726 --> 09:43.827
You have to tell him.

09:43.895 --> 09:45.896
Nicely,
but you have to tell him!

09:45.964 --> 09:47.030
I can't!

09:47.098 --> 09:48.397
He has to move out!

09:48.465 --> 09:50.365
Look, the guy is
helping us out with rent,

09:50.433 --> 09:52.602
and getting us
out of our debt situation.

09:52.669 --> 09:54.536
I totally owe him!

09:54.605 --> 09:55.838
I know.

09:55.906 --> 09:57.907
It's just that we're not
helping Ty out

09:57.975 --> 09:58.908
by letting him stay here.

09:58.976 --> 10:00.109
I mean, he's skipping school,

10:00.176 --> 10:02.011
he's just hanging around
doing nothing!

10:02.079 --> 10:03.312
He's not doing nothing!

10:03.379 --> 10:04.412
Heck, he built a fire pit;

10:04.480 --> 10:05.647
that's doing something.

10:06.849 --> 10:09.117
Ty needs a good kick
in the butt...

10:09.184 --> 10:10.919
on so many levels!

10:12.088 --> 10:14.723
If he didn't have us
to depend on,

10:14.790 --> 10:16.424
then maybe he'd start
thinking about

10:16.492 --> 10:18.760
getting back together with Amy.

10:18.828 --> 10:20.794
Do it, Caleb!

10:20.862 --> 10:21.996
Please?

10:25.133 --> 10:26.266
Hey.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.635
Do you have time
to help me now?

10:27.702 --> 10:29.603
I thought we could
go into town,

10:29.671 --> 10:31.839
pick out some paint colours?

10:31.906 --> 10:33.573
I can't, Lou.

10:34.909 --> 10:37.043
What is wrong with everyone?

10:37.111 --> 10:38.244
God, it's like I'm pregnant,

10:38.311 --> 10:39.779
I'm excited, I wanna nest,

10:39.847 --> 10:42.481
and where else was I supposed
to have a nursery?

10:42.549 --> 10:45.518
You know, it's like...
You know, we all agreed

10:45.585 --> 10:46.853
and now everyone is making me

10:46.920 --> 10:48.220
feel bad about this.

10:48.288 --> 10:50.523
Look, the last thing I wanna do

10:50.590 --> 10:52.124
is hurt your feelings, okay?

10:52.191 --> 10:53.692
And I am excited
about this baby...

10:53.760 --> 10:54.826
I am!

10:54.894 --> 10:56.361
But mom's room is being
torn apart,

10:56.428 --> 10:57.729
and I don't know, I just...

10:57.797 --> 10:59.531
It is not being torn apart,

10:59.598 --> 11:01.967
it's being given a new life!

11:02.035 --> 11:04.435
God, you and grandpa,
you're exactly the same,

11:04.503 --> 11:06.038
you know?

11:06.105 --> 11:08.706
Like, he hated the idea
of parting with his old truck,

11:08.774 --> 11:10.207
and now he loves his new truck;

11:10.275 --> 11:12.442
he hates looking
at mom's room now,

11:12.510 --> 11:13.610
but he's gonna love it

11:13.679 --> 11:15.245
when it's made up for the baby;

11:15.313 --> 11:16.814
and he hates the idea
of going to Paris,

11:16.882 --> 11:19.050
but when he get there,
he's gonna love that too!

11:19.117 --> 11:20.685
Paris?

11:20.752 --> 11:21.952
Oh God.

11:22.020 --> 11:25.021
Um, please don't say
anything, okay?

11:29.694 --> 11:32.796
♪ walk me over that bridge ♪

11:32.863 --> 11:36.566
♪ a river so deep and so wide ♪

11:37.501 --> 11:41.203
♪ just walk me over
this bridge ♪

11:41.270 --> 11:42.971
♪ my darling, ♪

11:43.907 --> 11:49.377
♪ we'll get to the other...
Side ♪

11:51.081 --> 11:52.781
That's really pretty.

11:52.849 --> 11:54.116
Keep going.

11:54.184 --> 11:55.617
There isn't any more.
It's, uh...

11:55.685 --> 11:59.053
I found this...
In Lyndy's guitar case here.

11:59.988 --> 12:02.156
It's a verse -
two verses...

12:02.224 --> 12:03.524
and a chorus,

12:03.592 --> 12:04.658
but that's all she wrote.

12:04.727 --> 12:07.061
There isn't any more.

12:08.130 --> 12:09.931
Grandpa...

12:09.998 --> 12:11.065
Paris, huh?

12:15.703 --> 12:16.970
I warned you.

12:19.741 --> 12:23.009
So Ashley's been
feeling like...

12:23.077 --> 12:24.644
Well, you know we love
having you here, right?

12:24.712 --> 12:27.147
Look, man, I gotta thank you.

12:27.215 --> 12:29.215
I mean, for taking me in.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.783
I-I don't know what
I would've done without you.

12:30.851 --> 12:31.784
No worries, man.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.418
You're a great guy, and...

12:33.486 --> 12:37.890
I mean, only a really good
friend would do that,

12:37.958 --> 12:39.291
and thank you.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.659
No, man.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.728
You're the best buddy,
bar none.

12:42.796 --> 12:43.995
Look...

12:44.930 --> 12:47.465
I know cowboys
aren't much for...

12:47.532 --> 12:50.935
Talking about feelings
and crap like that...

12:51.003 --> 12:52.203
Yeah.

12:52.271 --> 12:55.539
But when a man's about
to take a major step

12:55.607 --> 12:57.742
like getting married,

12:57.810 --> 12:59.077
you sorta...

12:59.145 --> 13:00.577
Take and count the things
that really matter,

13:00.645 --> 13:03.747
and you, dude, you matter.

13:03.815 --> 13:06.216
Thanks, man.

13:06.284 --> 13:10.320
Oh, I'm serious!
You're my best friend, Ty.

13:11.722 --> 13:13.290
You know what?

13:13.357 --> 13:14.992
I got a crazy idea.

13:15.059 --> 13:17.226
Shoot.
I'm gettin' married, right?

13:17.294 --> 13:20.930
Yeah.
Gonna need a best man, right?

13:20.998 --> 13:22.932
Oh no, man, are you sure?

13:23.000 --> 13:23.966
Yes, I am!

13:24.034 --> 13:25.334
All right, man, I'll do it!

13:26.937 --> 13:28.370
Hey, Ashley!

13:28.438 --> 13:30.206
Guess what?

13:30.274 --> 13:32.774
Ty's gonna be my best man.

13:32.842 --> 13:33.909
Isn't that great?

13:41.712 --> 13:45.281
If Caleb has a best man,
I have to have bridesmaids.

13:45.349 --> 13:47.116
So, will you do it?

13:48.050 --> 13:49.551
Absolutely!

13:49.619 --> 13:50.652
Sure.

13:50.720 --> 13:53.388
Oh! That's great!

13:53.456 --> 13:55.423
Oh, you are gonna make
my mom's day!

13:55.492 --> 13:57.258
Oh, I gotta go.

13:57.326 --> 13:59.628
Sorry, gotta pick out
color schemes with her.

13:59.696 --> 14:00.629
Is that okay?

14:00.697 --> 14:01.663
Yeah, go.

14:01.731 --> 14:02.998
I'll take care of things here.

14:03.065 --> 14:04.999
Oh! Thanks! Love you girls!

14:05.066 --> 14:06.233
See 'ya.

14:06.301 --> 14:08.369
Great.
Ty is Caleb's best man.

14:08.436 --> 14:10.505
That's not gonna be
awkward at all.

14:10.572 --> 14:11.739
Look, Amy,

14:11.807 --> 14:12.840
I know you're going through
a rough spot.

14:12.908 --> 14:14.709
I just want you to know
that I'm here.

14:14.776 --> 14:16.443
So, you know, let's hang out

14:16.512 --> 14:17.812
and do stuff like we used to.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.513
I'd like that.

14:19.580 --> 14:22.682
And I wanted
to tell you something.

14:22.750 --> 14:24.784
I know I came off
a bit weird about Chase,

14:24.852 --> 14:26.019
you know, asking why
he put that bid

14:26.086 --> 14:27.787
on Dexter for you.

14:27.855 --> 14:28.855
It's okay, Soraya.

14:28.923 --> 14:31.157
No, no, I was totally off.

14:31.225 --> 14:32.559
I mean, why wouldn't
he do that?

14:32.627 --> 14:36.361
That is exactly the kind
of generous guy he is.

14:36.429 --> 14:37.830
So, I'm sorry.

14:38.765 --> 14:39.698
You know, I was a bit jealous,

14:39.766 --> 14:42.134
and I had no reason to be.

14:42.201 --> 14:43.735
Well...

14:43.802 --> 14:45.136
It all worked out, right?

14:45.203 --> 14:47.204
So, no worries.

14:47.272 --> 14:48.472
Thanks.

14:53.078 --> 14:54.478
Morning.

14:54.547 --> 14:56.247
Hey!

14:56.314 --> 14:57.448
So, update.

14:57.516 --> 14:59.716
What's happening
with my trophy?

14:59.784 --> 15:02.318
Well, I just haven't
had time, so...

15:02.386 --> 15:03.687
I mean, I'm gonna, it's just,

15:03.755 --> 15:05.856
well, it's on my "to do" list.

15:05.924 --> 15:07.925
You've got a "to do" list?

15:07.992 --> 15:10.761
Why'd I ever give you
the trophy?

15:10.828 --> 15:13.830
Get it fixed or give it back!

15:16.967 --> 15:18.300
Okay, so that'll work

15:18.368 --> 15:20.970
if I put the Rollands
next to the Cartwrights.

15:21.038 --> 15:22.137
But they hate each other.

15:22.205 --> 15:23.573
No, no, they're speaking now.

15:23.640 --> 15:26.141
Oh, and they'll love
the Rovati's.

15:26.209 --> 15:28.243
Okay, so what's the list at?

15:28.311 --> 15:30.980
Like 200 guests?

15:31.048 --> 15:32.948
On everything?

15:33.015 --> 15:34.082
I'm not!

15:35.417 --> 15:37.485
In fact,
you'll be happy to know

15:37.553 --> 15:38.753
that I changed my mind.

15:38.821 --> 15:41.022
Amy and Soraya are gonna be
my bridesmaids,

15:41.090 --> 15:43.391
and Ty's gonna be
Caleb's best man.

15:43.459 --> 15:46.194
Well, well!
That's great!

15:46.261 --> 15:48.662
So, we'll get the girls
to the dressmaker next week,

15:48.730 --> 15:51.331
and don't forget,
you've got a fitting on Friday.

15:51.399 --> 15:54.301
Ashley, we've got to talk
to the chef at the polo club

15:54.368 --> 15:56.336
and decide on the menu!

15:56.404 --> 15:57.471
Okay.

16:01.142 --> 16:02.275
A bridesmaid?

16:02.343 --> 16:04.877
Yeah.
With val running the show?

16:04.945 --> 16:07.346
Yeah,
and Ty is the best man.

16:07.414 --> 16:08.447
Good times.

16:08.515 --> 16:10.583
Yikes, that's brutal!

16:14.021 --> 16:16.889
So I'm not trying to be
difficult on purpose.

16:19.359 --> 16:21.860
You know the addition off
the living room there,

16:21.928 --> 16:24.429
well, I built that
when your mom was born.

16:24.497 --> 16:25.864
Lyndy and I moved in there

16:25.932 --> 16:27.966
and this was
your mom's nursery.

16:28.034 --> 16:30.301
You probably didn't like
any of those changes

16:30.369 --> 16:31.903
one bit either, right?

16:31.971 --> 16:33.038
Well, I do remember

16:33.106 --> 16:35.273
putting up a bit of a fight.

16:35.341 --> 16:37.775
Well, Lyndy was getting
so fed up with me

16:37.843 --> 16:41.311
around that time,

16:42.247 --> 16:44.314
do you...
Do you girls think

16:44.382 --> 16:46.684
I'm being unreasonable
about this trip thing?

16:46.752 --> 16:50.454
You know, just look at it
like an adventure.

16:50.522 --> 16:52.421
I think you need to make
your own decisions.

16:54.759 --> 16:56.492
Well...

16:56.560 --> 16:58.728
I hear they make you
take your boots off.

17:00.798 --> 17:04.433
My mom is inviting not only
everyone from the country,

17:04.501 --> 17:06.670
but the entire world!

17:06.737 --> 17:08.971
People I've never even met.

17:09.039 --> 17:10.638
Can't you just tell her no?

17:10.707 --> 17:11.740
I can't.

17:11.808 --> 17:14.209
She'll make me feel guilty.

17:14.277 --> 17:16.578
Maybe we should
just elope again.

17:16.646 --> 17:18.346
Go on a second honeymoon?

17:18.414 --> 17:21.884
Honey, I really, really wish
that we could do that,

17:21.951 --> 17:24.852
but we just don't
have the money.

17:25.788 --> 17:27.354
Come on.
In the end,

17:27.422 --> 17:29.857
all that really matters
is that we're getting married.

17:29.925 --> 17:31.826
Like, actually married.

17:31.894 --> 17:35.629
I don't really care where
or how we do it.

17:35.698 --> 17:37.098
Really?
Really.

17:38.133 --> 17:39.266
I love you, cowboy.

17:39.334 --> 17:41.134
I love you too.

17:45.606 --> 17:46.740
Oh God!
Sorry, guys.

17:46.808 --> 17:48.942
Um... I didn't mean
to um...

17:49.010 --> 17:50.610
No, man, forget it.
It's cool.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.679
I'll just grab my jacket here.

17:52.747 --> 17:54.081
Tell him!

17:55.349 --> 17:57.083
Hey, best man,

17:59.152 --> 18:00.552
I was thinking...

18:00.620 --> 18:02.822
Can I take you out
for a beer or something?

18:02.889 --> 18:04.323
Uh, yeah.
Sure, man.

18:04.390 --> 18:05.524
You know what?

18:05.592 --> 18:06.592
Why don't we make it
a mini stag?

18:06.659 --> 18:08.227
Just you and me.

18:08.294 --> 18:09.394
Sounds good.
Let's do it.

18:09.462 --> 18:10.529
All right.

18:20.039 --> 18:21.172
Where are you off to?

18:21.240 --> 18:22.540
Uh, Marnie's.

18:22.608 --> 18:24.909
Apparently she has some fabulous
decorating books

18:24.977 --> 18:26.477
for me to look at.

18:26.545 --> 18:28.145
You should see
Jerry junior's nursery.

18:28.213 --> 18:29.679
Total cowboy motif.

18:29.748 --> 18:31.648
It's so adorable.

18:31.716 --> 18:33.350
Apparently she's hoping
the next one is a girl

18:33.417 --> 18:34.818
so that she can do unicorns.

18:34.886 --> 18:35.886
Well, where's Amy?

18:35.954 --> 18:36.920
Maggie's.

18:36.988 --> 18:38.321
Ashley had a little after hours

18:38.389 --> 18:40.523
bridesmaid get-together.

18:40.591 --> 18:41.725
So it looks like
you got the house

18:41.793 --> 18:43.127
to yourself, old man.

18:43.194 --> 18:44.761
And if Peter calls me,

18:44.828 --> 18:46.729
tell him he can reach me
on my cell.

18:46.797 --> 18:47.730
Bye.

18:47.798 --> 18:48.865

19:47.754 --> 19:49.221
Get some glasses?

19:50.656 --> 19:51.723
Okay.

20:00.005 --> 20:00.805
Let's raise some hell, brother!

20:00.873 --> 20:02.107
All right!

20:03.508 --> 20:04.776
To future wedded bliss.

20:04.844 --> 20:06.644
Take two.

20:10.548 --> 20:12.149
Hit us again, sir!

20:12.217 --> 20:13.851
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How're we gonna drive home?

20:13.918 --> 20:15.552
We'll walk, man.
We'll walk.

20:15.620 --> 20:17.888
So, you and Amy...

20:17.956 --> 20:19.456
Caleb, I don't want
to talk about it.

20:19.523 --> 20:20.891
We're here to have fun, right?

20:20.959 --> 20:22.960
And we will, but...

20:23.027 --> 20:25.862
You know you have
to talk to her.

20:25.929 --> 20:27.563
You two,
you need to be together!

20:27.631 --> 20:29.265
No, I don't need Amy!

20:29.332 --> 20:30.699
I don't want to need Amy.

20:30.768 --> 20:31.834
I don't want to need anybody!

20:31.902 --> 20:34.837
Oh man, just listen to me.

20:34.905 --> 20:37.206
Okay, obviously I'm no expert,

20:37.274 --> 20:38.841
but I think I got
my ducks lined up

20:38.909 --> 20:40.642
a little bit better
than you do.

20:40.709 --> 20:42.343
Can't you just...
Get over it

20:42.411 --> 20:43.845
and move on?

20:43.913 --> 20:46.514
It's clear as clear that
you two belong together!

20:46.582 --> 20:48.083
It's not clear at all.

20:48.151 --> 20:49.384
Okay, fine.

20:49.451 --> 20:51.987
But you got a life with
or without Amy.

20:52.054 --> 20:53.755
Yeah, I do.

20:54.690 --> 20:56.290
You don't wanna be
cramped up in a trailer

20:56.357 --> 20:58.025
with a couple of newlyweds.

20:58.093 --> 20:59.794
I mean, what is that?

20:59.861 --> 21:01.195
Not cool.

21:01.263 --> 21:05.231
You should...
Move back to your loft,

21:05.300 --> 21:07.334
or somewhere else.

21:07.402 --> 21:08.602
Somewhere else?

21:08.670 --> 21:09.736
Yeah.

21:11.839 --> 21:14.140
What, you don't want me
in the trailer?

21:14.208 --> 21:15.575
Is this you telling me
to move out?

21:15.643 --> 21:17.177
This is me telling you
as a friend.

21:17.244 --> 21:18.811
As a friend?
As a friend.

21:18.878 --> 21:19.945
If you wanted me to move out,

21:20.013 --> 21:22.815
why didn't you just say so?

21:23.817 --> 21:24.750
This sucks, man,

21:24.818 --> 21:26.919
after all I've done for you.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.555
I built you a fire pit, man!

21:29.623 --> 21:31.324
I built him a fire pit!

21:31.391 --> 21:32.525
No, you know what?

21:32.592 --> 21:33.959
Did I ask you to do that, huh?

21:34.027 --> 21:36.661
Hey!
You're Caleb Odell!

21:36.729 --> 21:40.332
That super bad excuse
for a bronc rider from okotoks?

21:40.399 --> 21:41.533
Excuse me?

21:41.600 --> 21:43.600
You got a problem, man?

21:44.403 --> 21:45.903
No problem.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.739
I just want you to know
what company you're keeping.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.040
Trevor darling.

21:49.107 --> 21:51.141
Darling? Come on,
I barely know you.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.744
That's funny.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.813
I saw you last year
in Hudson.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.247
Not bad.

21:57.315 --> 21:58.649
I ride too.

21:58.717 --> 22:00.984
Bareback.
Bareback, huh?

22:01.052 --> 22:02.553
What's the highest score
you ever got?

22:02.620 --> 22:04.254
89.5.

22:04.322 --> 22:05.589
Well, I got that
in my first competition.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.590
I was only...Fifteen.

22:07.658 --> 22:08.891
Oh yeah?

22:08.959 --> 22:09.959
How about we grab some shots, guys,

22:10.026 --> 22:11.594
and talk about it, all right?

22:11.662 --> 22:13.329
Hey, Pete!
Three more shots.

22:13.397 --> 22:15.398
You got it!

22:19.403 --> 22:20.636
What is that?

22:20.704 --> 22:21.937
"Walk me over the bridge"?

22:22.005 --> 22:24.339
Uh, that's just part
of a song I found

22:24.407 --> 22:26.307
in an old guitar case.

22:26.376 --> 22:28.443
So that meeting you were at,

22:28.511 --> 22:29.845
what was that all about?

22:29.912 --> 22:30.945
Well, it was with a guy

22:31.013 --> 22:33.181
who has a beautiful
breed stock,

22:33.249 --> 22:34.449
and he operates out of Avignon,

22:34.517 --> 22:36.217
which is about half an hour
from my place.

22:36.285 --> 22:37.986
And so I was thinking,

22:38.053 --> 22:39.854
that we could take
a little bit of a road trip

22:39.921 --> 22:42.556
and go and see his setup...

22:43.492 --> 22:44.759
When you come to France,

22:44.826 --> 22:46.727
if you booked your ticket.

22:46.795 --> 22:49.830
No.
No, I haven't.

22:52.801 --> 22:55.568
Well, it's getting
kinda silly, isn't it?

22:55.636 --> 22:57.069
I mean, I know
you're afraid to fly,

22:57.137 --> 22:58.705
but...
Well, if you understand that,

22:58.773 --> 23:01.875
then why are you
pressuring me to do it?

23:01.942 --> 23:03.676
Pressuring you?

23:03.744 --> 23:07.113
I'm not pressuring you;
You agreed to go!

23:07.180 --> 23:09.181
And now?
I'm backing out.

23:09.249 --> 23:11.082
There!

23:11.150 --> 23:14.152
There it is.
I'm backing out.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.154
I guess it's hard for me
to change my ways.

23:18.725 --> 23:20.559
Well, it's hard for me too.

23:20.627 --> 23:22.628
But, you know,
you're always complaining

23:22.695 --> 23:23.796
when I go away.

23:23.863 --> 23:25.664
I am not!

23:25.732 --> 23:27.732
Well, yes, you do.

23:29.234 --> 23:32.369
Jack, I love France.
It's beautiful.

23:32.438 --> 23:34.705
I want you to come,
it's important to me!

23:34.773 --> 23:36.974
But if you won't come,
I'm not gonna stop going.

23:37.042 --> 23:38.709
Well, I'm not about to start.

23:39.645 --> 23:40.912
Well, then maybe your
fear of flying

23:40.979 --> 23:43.780
is bigger than your
fear of losing me.

23:43.848 --> 23:45.749
You should think about that.

23:51.989 --> 23:55.358
Yeah, I got totally busted up
in Great Falls, Montana.

23:55.426 --> 23:56.893
Got my racked up
against a gate.

23:56.961 --> 23:58.294
Yeah, it was like a rag doll.

23:58.362 --> 24:00.195
Yeah, but I-brutal!
Totally brutal.

24:00.263 --> 24:03.298
I back on the circuit in less
than three months, right?

24:03.366 --> 24:05.167
You were a machine!

24:05.234 --> 24:06.902
Totally cleaned up.

24:06.970 --> 24:08.136
Where'd you rank?

24:08.204 --> 24:09.605
Sixth.
Third on the Al...

24:09.673 --> 24:12.040
Third on the Alberta circuit.

24:12.108 --> 24:13.308
Right, no, that's right, yeah.

24:13.376 --> 24:15.510
Yep.
15,824 points!

24:16.479 --> 24:18.379
Can we get some more
shots here?

24:18.447 --> 24:19.514
Drinks all round!

24:19.582 --> 24:20.648
Yeah, buddy!

24:23.352 --> 24:25.920
- Woo!
- Hey yeaaah!

24:25.988 --> 24:27.121
Boilermaker!

24:27.189 --> 24:28.356
Here we go!

24:29.925 --> 24:31.859
All right, chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

24:31.926 --> 24:33.627
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

24:34.562 --> 24:35.929
Yeaaaaaah!

24:38.466 --> 24:40.634
That's how we do it!

24:41.569 --> 24:44.571
Well, you boys should know,
I'm not just a bronc rider.

24:44.639 --> 24:46.806
No, that's for guys
with just one trick.

24:46.874 --> 24:48.040
Like Trevor.

24:48.108 --> 24:50.476
Ol' one trick trevy.

24:50.544 --> 24:52.778
No, I've also won
all around cowboy.

24:52.846 --> 24:54.079
What rodeo?

24:54.147 --> 24:55.047
The Hudson rodeo.

24:56.149 --> 24:57.783
Wow, that's the big time.

24:57.851 --> 24:59.451
What was your other event?

24:59.520 --> 25:00.620
Mutton busting?

25:00.687 --> 25:01.854
Hold on!

25:01.922 --> 25:04.990
I've actually won
all around cowboy twice.

25:05.058 --> 25:06.758
I also won ponoka.

25:06.826 --> 25:08.693
And that's the big one.

25:08.761 --> 25:09.828
Ponoka?

25:09.896 --> 25:11.363
Yeah, ponoka.

25:11.431 --> 25:13.165
You're full of it, man.

25:13.233 --> 25:14.833
You're a liar.

25:14.901 --> 25:15.901
You calling me a liar?

25:15.968 --> 25:17.769
I just did.

25:17.837 --> 25:19.904
He never won at ponoka.

25:19.971 --> 25:23.974
I'd remember if he were ever
all round cowboy at ponoka.

25:24.043 --> 25:25.676
I was born and raised
in ponoka.

25:25.744 --> 25:27.111
Yeah well,
you're wrong, brother.

25:27.179 --> 25:30.348
And you know what?
I'm gonna prove it to you.

25:31.950 --> 25:34.952
Caleb, what are you doing?

25:35.020 --> 25:36.553
No, no, Caleb!

25:36.620 --> 25:38.088
You can't bring that
in there, that's Tim's!

25:38.156 --> 25:39.222
Are you crazy?

25:39.290 --> 25:40.357
Yes, I am.

25:42.927 --> 25:43.993
Oh, stupid!

25:44.929 --> 25:46.296
Caleb!

25:46.364 --> 25:47.630
Oh boy, you got somethin'
to see!

25:47.698 --> 25:49.832
Check it out! Whoo!

25:52.402 --> 25:54.203
Come on, Lisa.

26:09.685 --> 26:11.519
So, when are you coming back?

26:11.587 --> 26:12.887
How many more shows, Chase?

26:12.955 --> 26:14.589
I miss you.

26:14.656 --> 26:17.292
Yeah, he is such
a boy sometimes.

26:17.359 --> 26:19.060
Actually 98 percent
of the time.

26:19.128 --> 26:23.863
But despite Caleb's craziness,
I still love him.

26:23.931 --> 26:25.999
Sorry, am I boring you?

26:26.934 --> 26:28.768
No, it's just hard
to hang out with girls

26:28.836 --> 26:31.871
who are ridiculously happy
with their love life.

26:31.939 --> 26:33.807
You know, Ty's totally changed.

26:33.874 --> 26:36.009
All this I hear about
him skipping out on school,

26:36.077 --> 26:38.345
and hanging around
doing nothing?

26:38.413 --> 26:39.445
I just don't know how
he can become

26:39.513 --> 26:41.147
so stupid and selfish.

26:41.215 --> 26:44.783
Amy, Ty is anything
but selfish.

26:44.851 --> 26:46.819
He just gave Caleb and I
a pile of money

26:46.886 --> 26:49.822
to help us pay off our debt.

26:49.889 --> 26:51.491
Where did he get
the money from?

26:51.558 --> 26:52.992
He won it.

26:53.059 --> 26:54.460
He and Chase both wanted
to put a bid on Dexter,

26:54.528 --> 26:56.495
and Ty bet Chase 5,000 dollars

26:56.562 --> 26:58.230
he could beat him at pool,
and he did.

26:58.297 --> 27:01.199
And then when your dad
pulled Dexter out of the race,

27:01.267 --> 27:04.236
Ty shared his winnings with us.

27:06.805 --> 27:08.173
Yeah, buddy.

27:08.241 --> 27:11.208
Come on,
smile for the camera.

27:11.276 --> 27:13.377
Whoo!
Shots all around!

27:13.445 --> 27:15.078
Hey, let me take
a look at that.

27:15.147 --> 27:16.547
Yeah, that picture's awesome!

27:16.615 --> 27:18.282
Yeah!

27:18.350 --> 27:19.416

27:32.296 --> 27:35.431

after Marion was born.

27:53.949 --> 27:55.750
You know that?

27:55.818 --> 27:57.719
Yeah, I figured.

27:58.854 --> 28:01.222
I was so miserable.

28:01.290 --> 28:04.158
I missed being on the road
with the band, and...

28:04.226 --> 28:05.459
And you,

28:06.528 --> 28:08.229
well, you were so busy
with the ranch

28:08.297 --> 28:10.164
you didn't know how
I was really feeling.

28:10.232 --> 28:12.700
I mean I-I tried
to tell you, but...

28:12.767 --> 28:13.834
I'm sorry.

28:15.703 --> 28:16.936
I didn't know.

28:21.342 --> 28:24.644
I wondered if we'd ever
be able to make it work.

28:24.712 --> 28:28.181
But we did, huh?
Didn't we?

28:29.617 --> 28:31.184
Yes, we did.

28:32.452 --> 28:34.019
We got through it.

28:34.087 --> 28:36.322
It was good for us in the end.

28:36.389 --> 28:38.190
Yes, it was.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.092
Very good.

28:40.159 --> 28:41.627

29:23.300 --> 29:24.734

my best man.

29:26.503 --> 29:28.771
You're full of bull, Odell.

29:28.838 --> 29:30.038
What are you talkin' about?

29:30.106 --> 29:31.474
Look at this.

29:31.541 --> 29:34.343
There's a date scratched
in the bottom of this thing.

29:34.411 --> 29:35.477
1985.

29:37.380 --> 29:39.547
1985, man.

29:39.615 --> 29:42.183
This trophy is older
than you are.

29:45.421 --> 29:46.988
Hey! Settle down!

29:50.359 --> 29:52.092
Oof!

29:57.532 --> 29:58.699
Aaah!

30:01.736 --> 30:02.803
Yaaah!

30:05.440 --> 30:06.540
Aaah!

30:06.608 --> 30:07.940
Whoo!

30:09.576 --> 30:10.510
Whoa!

30:16.717 --> 30:17.684
Thanks.

30:17.751 --> 30:18.785
Aaaaah!

30:23.589 --> 30:26.458
Come on Caleb, let's go!

30:26.526 --> 30:27.793
Yah!

30:32.064 --> 30:33.298
Could you get here now?

30:35.407 --> 30:37.909
I don't believe this!
Of all the humiliating...

30:37.977 --> 30:39.744
You are not worth
the ground you walk on!

30:39.812 --> 30:41.612
Hold on, val.
Just hear me...

30:41.680 --> 30:43.413
No! You hold on.

30:43.481 --> 30:44.581
When I think of the beautiful
wedding

30:44.649 --> 30:45.816
I' t throwing for
the two of you,

30:45.884 --> 30:47.918
and the money it's costing me?

30:47.986 --> 30:49.386
It makes me sick!

30:49.454 --> 30:51.021
Neither of us asked
for a big fancy wedding,

30:51.089 --> 30:52.223
did we, val?

30:52.290 --> 30:54.791
That was all your big fat idea.

30:54.860 --> 30:55.993
I beg your pardon?

30:56.061 --> 30:57.862
Don't talk to my mom like that!

30:57.929 --> 30:58.928
Look at you.

30:58.996 --> 31:00.263
You smell like a brewery!

31:00.331 --> 31:01.630
You're the one always
complaining

31:01.698 --> 31:03.799
about her being
so out of control!

31:03.868 --> 31:04.968
- What?
- What?!

31:05.035 --> 31:05.969
Well, it's true!

31:06.036 --> 31:07.436
I know you hate this!

31:07.504 --> 31:09.672
You turned the whole thing
into a circus!

31:10.941 --> 31:12.608
That's wonderful!

31:12.676 --> 31:14.244
How ungrateful can
you be, Ashley?

31:14.311 --> 31:15.844
I've never said that!

31:15.912 --> 31:17.645
Okay fine, you know what?
I don't even care!

31:17.713 --> 31:19.814
I am done with you two!
Both of you!

31:19.883 --> 31:20.949
You do what you want!

31:21.017 --> 31:22.784
You're such an idiot.

31:22.852 --> 31:24.253

verses come from?

31:44.706 --> 31:45.706
Did you write them?

31:45.774 --> 31:47.440
Uh, no. Um...

31:49.543 --> 31:51.311
It's strange, I um...

31:52.246 --> 31:54.381
I dreamt about this song
last night,

31:54.448 --> 31:55.515
and lyndy.

31:56.717 --> 31:58.451
She was singing it.

31:58.519 --> 32:00.586
It was almost...

32:00.654 --> 32:02.022
Well, it was!

32:02.089 --> 32:05.291
She was sitting right there,
in her chair.

32:06.826 --> 32:09.061
The lyrics were
as clear as day,

32:11.064 --> 32:12.464
I got up and wrote 'em down,

32:14.034 --> 32:16.368
before I forgot 'em, and...

32:19.305 --> 32:20.871
No, I'm not crazy.

32:24.476 --> 32:25.576
Oh, God!

32:25.644 --> 32:27.545
Turn it off! Oh!

32:34.253 --> 32:35.652
Let's get out of here, man.

32:42.593 --> 32:43.927
Oh, crap.

32:45.529 --> 32:47.331
I remember setting it
on the bar.

32:47.398 --> 32:48.832
I swear it's gotta be
here somewhere.

32:48.899 --> 32:50.500
No, no, some guy had it
over here at the table,

32:50.568 --> 32:51.667
didn't he?

32:51.734 --> 32:53.202
Right around here.

32:53.270 --> 32:54.570
No, no, it was that cowboy,

32:54.637 --> 32:55.338
the one who was giving me
all the lip.

32:55.405 --> 32:56.638
What was his name again?

32:56.706 --> 32:58.507
What do you troublemakers want?

32:58.575 --> 33:00.642
Remember that trophy that
I came in with last night?

33:00.710 --> 33:02.544
- Do you know where it is?
- How should I know?

33:02.612 --> 33:04.780
I'm still cleaning up
after you guys!

33:04.848 --> 33:06.182
Get outta here.

33:07.216 --> 33:08.483
Get!

33:10.386 --> 33:11.987
You ripped off the name plate.

33:12.054 --> 33:13.621
I can't believe you
ripped off the name plate!

33:13.689 --> 33:15.090
Just shhh!

33:15.157 --> 33:17.825
I'm trying to think.
But nothing's happening.

33:17.893 --> 33:21.296
Well we gotta do something,
we can't just sit here!

33:21.364 --> 33:22.430
Hey!

33:24.799 --> 33:26.233
Where's my damn trophy?

33:26.301 --> 33:29.203
Uh... it's just in the shop
being fixed now.

33:29.270 --> 33:31.205
When am I gonna get it back?

33:31.272 --> 33:32.439
Just-just a few days.

33:32.507 --> 33:34.174
- Yeah.
- Tops.

33:36.311 --> 33:37.311
What happened to you guys?

33:37.379 --> 33:38.645
Oh! Ow!

33:38.713 --> 33:39.845
Ow!

33:45.919 --> 33:46.886
No, the hat's wrong man.

33:46.953 --> 33:48.121
He's wearing it.

33:48.188 --> 33:50.556
No man,
I think it's close enough.

33:50.624 --> 33:52.892
Come on, it's gonna cost us
a fortune!

33:52.959 --> 33:55.793
Yeah well, it's either that,
or Tim kills us.

33:55.861 --> 33:56.961
No, you!

33:57.030 --> 33:58.563
He's gonna kill you.

34:02.001 --> 34:03.935
Do you think he's gonna notice
the difference?

34:04.003 --> 34:05.270
Nah.

34:05.338 --> 34:07.639
Tim hadn't seen it in like
a thousand years.

34:08.841 --> 34:10.675
What were you thinking?

34:10.743 --> 34:12.208
You know what ash, right now,

34:12.277 --> 34:15.012
I just have more important
things to worry about.

34:15.080 --> 34:16.947
I don't think so!

34:17.014 --> 34:18.681
You know, my mom is seriously
thinking about

34:18.750 --> 34:20.951
pulling the plug
on this wedding!

34:21.018 --> 34:22.485
So what?

34:22.554 --> 34:24.388
So what?

34:24.456 --> 34:28.358
Neither of us wanted a big
expensive wedding, right?

34:28.426 --> 34:30.159
I mean, I don't remember
either of us asking

34:30.226 --> 34:32.628
for a big expensive wedding.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.330
Look I said I would
go along with this,

34:34.398 --> 34:36.433
as long as it made you happy.

34:36.500 --> 34:38.967
Is this you being happy?

34:39.036 --> 34:40.103
No.

34:42.773 --> 34:45.541
Why don't you guys
just have a BBQ?

34:45.608 --> 34:48.510
I mean, you've got
the fire pit for it, right?

35:08.863 --> 35:10.931
My mom's not here!

35:12.067 --> 35:13.734
She made her choice.

35:13.802 --> 35:16.536
It's gonna be all right, babe.

35:16.604 --> 35:19.172
Y t two ready?

35:34.988 --> 35:36.088
- Hey, val.
- Hi, Jack.

35:36.156 --> 35:37.223
Hi.

35:38.125 --> 35:39.091

We did it!

Whoo!

Hey, stranger.

36:33.977 --> 36:35.044
Hey.

36:36.279 --> 36:38.647
So how's that new job?

36:39.582 --> 36:40.649
Okay.

36:41.016 --> 36:42.617
How's life?

36:42.685 --> 36:44.152
Good times?

36:45.954 --> 36:48.323
Yeah, I've had better.

36:50.359 --> 36:51.559
Okay, be honest.

36:51.626 --> 36:54.228
Do I smell like
French fry grease?

36:55.863 --> 36:57.665
Well no, you don't.
Why do you ask?

36:57.732 --> 37:01.001
'Cause no one's asked
me to dance.

37:01.936 --> 37:04.338
Well, do you wanna dance?

37:05.273 --> 37:06.207
Come on.

37:06.274 --> 37:07.607
Let's go.

37:10.977 --> 37:12.345
You know how to two step?

37:12.413 --> 37:13.446
No?

37:13.514 --> 37:15.314
Okay, one, two.

37:16.817 --> 37:18.617
There, you got it!

37:18.685 --> 37:20.753
I miss those guys.

37:23.824 --> 37:25.157
There you go!

37:26.093 --> 37:28.060
Well, this really...

37:29.730 --> 37:32.230
It really is a lovely
party after all.

37:32.297 --> 37:33.798
I'm so glad you meme, mom.

37:33.866 --> 37:34.933
Oh, honey.

37:35.868 --> 37:38.469
I wouldn't have missed it.

37:38.537 --> 37:41.639
I wish you both all
the happiness in the world.

37:41.707 --> 37:43.775
Thank you, val.

37:43.843 --> 37:47.344
And because I didn't do
the big wedding,

37:47.411 --> 37:49.880
saving me more money than
you could possibly imagine...

37:51.382 --> 37:53.083
I wanna give you
a wedding present.

37:53.151 --> 37:54.684
Mom, no.

37:54.753 --> 37:55.685
You really don't have to.

37:55.754 --> 37:57.087
I insist!

37:58.256 --> 38:01.258
I booked you first class
airfares to Rome.

38:01.325 --> 38:03.960
You'll be staying in a five
star hotel for a week,

38:04.027 --> 38:06.495
and then my dear friends
the Rovatis,

38:06.563 --> 38:07.997
have offered you their
villa in Tuscany

38:08.065 --> 38:09.799
for three weeks.

38:09.867 --> 38:11.100
And you'll have it
all to yourselves.

38:11.168 --> 38:14.403
Mom, that's amazing!
Thank you!

38:14.471 --> 38:16.672
Cool.
Where's Tuscany?

38:18.408 --> 38:19.340
Uh, Caleb?

38:19.408 --> 38:21.309
We got a situation.

38:21.377 --> 38:22.610
Oh, no.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.481
Hey, Tim.

38:26.548 --> 38:28.116
Good timing.

38:29.852 --> 38:31.686
Check it out!

38:31.754 --> 38:32.854
Just got it back,

38:32.922 --> 38:34.189
looks pretty good, huh?

38:34.257 --> 38:35.389
It's all firm in the base,

38:35.456 --> 38:37.291
name plate's all tacked on,

38:37.358 --> 38:39.359
shiny and new looking.

38:39.427 --> 38:41.262
Hat's on his head.

38:42.197 --> 38:44.564
How-how did he do that?

38:45.500 --> 38:47.367
It's not my trophy.

38:48.303 --> 38:50.370
Where's my trophy?

38:53.140 --> 38:55.608
I'm gonna kill you, Odell.

38:56.543 --> 38:59.378
And you didn't even
invite me to your wedding.

38:59.446 --> 39:02.015
Come on Tim, I just...

39:02.082 --> 39:05.751
The other one just
kinda took a walk.

39:09.189 --> 39:10.923
Trevor darling says hello.

39:17.130 --> 39:18.831
Congratulations.

39:21.334 --> 39:24.468
You know, that hunk of metal
cost us 800 bucks!

39:26.671 --> 39:28.239
Looks good on 'ya.

39:34.183 --> 39:36.418
Now for a bronc rider, Caleb,

39:36.485 --> 39:39.587
we think that 8 seconds
makes the man.

39:40.522 --> 39:43.457
Because that 8 seconds
feels like a lifetime.

39:44.693 --> 39:45.992
Now in a funny way,

39:46.060 --> 39:48.662
marriage is like
riding a bronc.

39:48.730 --> 39:51.164
There's twists and turns,

39:51.232 --> 39:52.366
and the odd headache.

39:53.901 --> 39:57.003
But if you both ride it
like there's no tomorrow,

39:57.071 --> 40:00.506
that lifetime together
will feel like 8 seconds.

40:00.574 --> 40:02.142
Awww!

40:02.210 --> 40:03.276
And we'd like
to dedicate a song

40:03.344 --> 40:05.312
to Ashley and Caleb.

40:05.379 --> 40:08.348

43:34.075 --> 43:36.009

44:05.604 --> 44:06.938
