First, they were doing bread on the tree,

they switched it around.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.246

-One of the things that I'm worried about

19:24.329 --> 19:26.123
is the rice cereal,
there's no color on that,

<i>you know, it's nervousness</i>
<i>and insecurity of their actual skills,</i>

-so many of the important things.
-AMIRAH: Totally.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.643

Go back to Ralph's face
if you don't think it's done.

19:57.821 --> 19:59.865

a little bit to make sure

19:59.948 --> 20:01.491

in such a small amount of time.

28:43.596 --> 28:46.599

33:50.862 --> 33:52.780
the issue that I have
with the gingerbread houses

is just the piping technique

-(CONTESTANTS CHUCKLING)

the gamer wants to play this game?

37:37.338 --> 37:40.967
I mean, who wouldn't wanna jump
into a space jungle?

37:41.092 --> 37:43.219
-(CHUCKLES)
-SARAH: It's so bright and colorful.

37:43.302 --> 37:45.763
Okay. Well, I'm ready
to get into my favorite part

37:45.846 --> 37:47.848
is to find out about this game.

37:48.057 --> 37:51.560
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

37:51.727 --> 37:53.562
SHAUNA:<i> So, the game that we created</i>
<i>for the gamer to play</i>

37:53.646 --> 37:55.773
<i>is Supernova Swamplands.</i>

37:55.940 --> 37:58.234
<i>So, Wreck-It Ralph</i>
<i>falls right into a swamp.</i>

37:58.651 --> 38:00.528
<i>He's being chased by a meteor.</i>

38:00.695 --> 38:03.614
<i>He has to collect the tokens</i>
<i>to slow the meteor down.</i>

38:03.739 --> 38:07.410
If he can slow it down enough to stop
and talk to our Wise Space Snail,

38:07.493 --> 38:08.953
<i>which is like a guide for the game,</i>

38:09.287 --> 38:11.580
<i>to give him secrets</i>
<i>of how to get out of the swamp</i>

38:11.706 --> 38:13.833
<i>-and win the game.</i>
-Ooh!

38:14.083 --> 38:19.714
Ralph is made out of rice cereal treats,
modeling chocolate, fondant, and cake.

38:20.339 --> 38:23.342
SARAH:<i> The Space Snail is cake,</i>
<i>and then modeling chocolate</i>

38:23.426 --> 38:26.304
<i>-and fondant, and some airbrushing.</i>
-Oh, that's so cool.

38:26.387 --> 38:28.889
For the tree, what we ended up
having to do was just cover it

38:28.973 --> 38:32.351
<i>with royal icing and rice cereal treat,</i>
<i>and then to get the trails at the top,</i>

38:32.435 --> 38:35.646
<i>we have modeling chocolate,</i>
<i>and then a lot of airbrushing.</i>

38:35.730 --> 38:39.900
Now, I mean, I see this hammer here.
Does that tie into our game somehow?

38:40.026 --> 38:41.027
SARAH: Yes.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.529
<i>Felix wanted jump in</i>
<i>and check out this game too,</i>

38:43.654 --> 38:44.864
'cause it was so sweet.

38:44.989 --> 38:48.617
<i>And that hammer is... I actually carved it</i>
<i>out of a sweet potato.</i>

38:48.743 --> 38:53.372
Very cool. Now, let's talk about
our Supernova Swamplands cabinet.

38:53.581 --> 38:57.084
SHAUNA:<i> We used airbrush</i>
<i>to make it into like a cosmic wonderland</i>

38:57.168 --> 39:00.379
to really give our audience
a taste of like what it's gonna be like

39:00.463 --> 39:04.967
in a space jungle with all the swamp grass
kind of hanging off of it.

39:05.301 --> 39:08.971
<i>And the bright-colored</i>
<i>cosmic candies for the buttons.</i>

39:09.138 --> 39:12.183
Technically, there's a lot of things
that I love about this piece.

39:12.308 --> 39:13.559
I mean, that's Ralph.

39:14.185 --> 39:17.855
<i>When you take the time to kind of,</i>
<i>like, go deep in the mouth</i>

39:18.022 --> 39:20.107
<i>and then build the teeth in the front,</i>

39:20.191 --> 39:23.652
that is just like taking
the sculpting details to another level.

39:24.445 --> 39:27.448
I was worried because you guys
were spending so much time on the tree...

39:27.615 --> 39:29.158
-(CHUCKLES)
-BENNY: ...and, I actually like

39:29.241 --> 39:31.452
<i>how the tree looks.</i>
<i>You guys did an excellent job.</i>

39:32.370 --> 39:36.207
As a gamer, you wanna know how to play
with just visually looking at something.

39:36.332 --> 39:39.293
<i>The hammer, the tokens,</i>
<i>those things were very obvious,</i>

39:39.418 --> 39:41.670
<i>you made them gold,</i>
<i>you know where they are</i>

39:41.754 --> 39:43.047
and that's very important.

39:43.255 --> 39:45.883
You guys got so creative
not only with your concept,

39:45.966 --> 39:48.052
<i>but just with your use of materials.</i>

39:48.260 --> 39:53.182
Going to the ramen
and making that neon, so good.

39:53.391 --> 39:57.561
And what I really like about it
is that Ralph stayed true to himself,

39:57.645 --> 39:59.814
<i>his outfit, and his color scheme.</i>

39:59.980 --> 40:03.150
<i>He definitely looks</i>
<i>like he jumped into another game.</i>

40:03.609 --> 40:06.195
<i>Something I would have done</i>
<i>a little bit different story-wise</i>

40:06.278 --> 40:10.658
is just I wish that the meteor
was fully covered in some sort of color

40:10.783 --> 40:14.703
or something that screams meteor,
because at first glance,

40:14.787 --> 40:16.330
<i>it looks more like a tree.</i>

40:16.539 --> 40:18.165
I know that he's scared
and I know he's running away,

40:18.249 --> 40:20.042
but I wanna know that he's scared of that.

40:20.459 --> 40:23.045
But overall, I think that you girls
were very creative

40:23.170 --> 40:24.505
and very colorful.

40:24.630 --> 40:26.048
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

40:28.509 --> 40:31.220

to see a lot of colors

AMIRAH: <i>All the Ralphs looked great.</i>

40:37.059 --> 40:41.147
<i>I love that each one of them placed Ralph</i>
<i>in a completely different scenario,</i>

40:41.272 --> 40:43.566
<i>where he's either fighting</i>
<i>or being fought.</i>

40:44.066 --> 40:46.902
-It's true. But only one can win.
-Yeah.

-Yes.
