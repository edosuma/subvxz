I was born here.</i>

00:04.564 --> 00:06.190
<i>This is my home.</i>

00:06.323 --> 00:08.381
<i>- And mine.
- And mine.</i>

00:08.926 --> 00:11.932
<i>For centuries, supernatural
creatures have lived among us.</i>

00:12.060 --> 00:14.701
<i>They were vampires,
werewolves, doppelgangers...</i>

00:14.840 --> 00:16.803
<i>- witches.
- And even hybrids.</i>

00:16.832 --> 00:18.788
- There are those who protect them...
- What's going on?

00:18.914 --> 00:20.754
We just need to ask you a
few questions about your son.

00:20.783 --> 00:22.734
You have no idea
what you're up against.

00:22.763 --> 00:24.361
<i>And those who want them dead.</i>

00:24.390 --> 00:26.045
We are the beginning.

00:28.626 --> 00:30.728
<i>They are the ones we love.</i>

00:32.164 --> 00:33.957
<i>And the ones we've lost.</i>

00:33.987 --> 00:35.805
This magic is dark.

00:36.424 --> 00:39.573
You made your choice. Now
they're taking it out on me.

00:39.774 --> 00:42.362
- I'm sorry, grams! No!
- No!

00:43.039 --> 00:45.774
<i>Then there's Elena.
She's one of us now.</i>

00:46.168 --> 00:47.771
<i>A vampire.</i>

00:48.713 --> 00:50.630
<i>And I'll do anything
to help her survive.</i>

01:09.801 --> 01:11.507
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:11.537 --> 01:13.465
- You're making a big mistake.
- No, I'm not.

01:13.495 --> 01:15.938
If I can get Elena used to
animal blood right out the gate...

01:16.198 --> 01:18.759
- You're reaching.
- ... Maybe she'll be able to bypass

01:18.789 --> 01:21.361
- all the things that we went through.
- Delusional.

01:21.489 --> 01:23.746
- Maybe she actually has a shot at this.
- Wrong.

01:23.777 --> 01:26.215
- You're just wrong, Stefan.
- She won't be able to handle it

01:26.245 --> 01:29.474
if she hurts someone, Damon.
Her compassion is her Achilles' heel,

01:29.504 --> 01:31.335
and everything is
magnified right now.

01:31.365 --> 01:33.081
Then you better hope
she's not a fan of Bambi.

01:38.540 --> 01:40.194
Close your eyes.

01:47.304 --> 01:49.972
She needs human blood,
Stefan. From the vein.

01:50.100 --> 01:52.882
Oh, come on, you know what happens.
You name me a vampire

01:52.912 --> 01:54.896
who didn't kill at least one
person when they were new.

01:54.926 --> 01:57.704
You name me one who went on the
bunny diet and didn't kill dozens.

02:01.570 --> 02:03.566
If she kills someone,
she will crumble.

02:03.596 --> 02:07.012
How much pain do you think she can take
before she shuts off her humanity switch?

02:07.129 --> 02:09.521
It happens to the best
of us at least once.

02:09.787 --> 02:12.064
We get over it, Stefan.
A hundred years or so.

02:12.094 --> 02:13.913
Yeah, well, I think I'd
like her to skip that part.

02:14.193 --> 02:16.402
She can't learn
to control the blood lust

02:16.432 --> 02:18.669
if she's never actually
experienced the blood lust.

02:18.798 --> 02:20.588
- What are you doing? Knock it off.
- It's like a cheat.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.798
Like giving a kid a calculator
before they know math.

02:23.057 --> 02:24.858
I said stop.

02:29.370 --> 02:30.931
Don't worry, he'll heel.

02:30.961 --> 02:32.682
Bigger animals
are more resilient.

02:33.302 --> 02:34.305
Hey.

02:34.728 --> 02:36.504
You did it.

02:36.862 --> 02:38.287
I know it's hard.

02:40.170 --> 02:41.937
But you can do this.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.115
Wow.
What's going on?

02:49.376 --> 02:52.828
Oh, we're just having a little
disagreement about process, right?

02:52.966 --> 02:54.646
You're still not on board
with the animal plan.

02:54.798 --> 02:55.733
Nope.

02:55.763 --> 02:58.534
I say rip off the proverbial
band-aid and let it bleed.

02:58.564 --> 03:00.875
You're a vampire, Elena.
Be a vampire.

03:01.341 --> 03:03.162
You ready to go?

03:05.500 --> 03:07.390
Vampires eat people.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.634
It's part of the natural
food pyramid.

03:11.490 --> 03:12.973
Trust me.

03:13.233 --> 03:15.182
You're going to be miserable.

03:16.009 --> 03:17.514
- I can't do it.
- All right,

03:17.544 --> 03:19.235
it's like the starting
line of a race, right?

03:19.264 --> 03:21.746
So you just push off with every
ounce of strength that you have, ok?

03:21.776 --> 03:23.889
I was a cheerleader.
I sucked at track.

03:23.919 --> 03:26.193
Just concentrate, ok?
You can do it.

03:28.134 --> 03:31.537
I can't. All I can think about
is your hands on my body.

03:32.158 --> 03:35.150
No, no, no, I didn't...
I didn't say take them off.

03:35.546 --> 03:37.378
- It feels good.
- Yeah?

03:39.411 --> 03:41.152
What does it feel like?

03:43.182 --> 03:45.180
It feels like you're touching every...

03:45.597 --> 03:47.461
nerve on my body.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.281
Everything is heightened.

03:52.894 --> 03:54.240
Taste.

03:55.251 --> 03:56.939
The smell.

03:57.860 --> 04:00.397
Sight. Touch.

"Faulty gas line leads to

05:37.007 --> 05:37.802
Really?

05:37.831 --> 05:40.988
Better than "Town Council blown
up, police have no suspects".

05:42.584 --> 05:44.750
Unless the perpetrator's
right next to me.

05:45.009 --> 05:47.576
Well, don't look at me. I always
take credit for killing people.

05:49.723 --> 05:52.547
Seriously, stop looking
at me like that, Liz.

05:53.067 --> 05:55.507
If I was going to kill ten people,
I wouldn't blow 'em up.

05:56.201 --> 05:59.677
- I'd have a dinner party.
- The explosion was sparked from inside.

05:59.706 --> 06:02.701
- This wasn't an accident.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.

06:02.940 --> 06:05.103
The Council's dead, Liz.
I see that as a win.

06:05.242 --> 06:07.281
I've known some of the
Council since I was a kid.

06:07.444 --> 06:09.904
- They were my friends.
- Well, ur friends tried to kill your daughter.

06:11.745 --> 06:13.606
- Who's the new guy?
- Excuse me, Sheriff.

06:14.103 --> 06:16.769
Hi. I was wondering if I could
speak to you for a minute.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.576
It's about the explosion
at the Young farm.

06:18.788 --> 06:21.391
- I'm sorry, mister...
- Connor Jordan.

06:22.134 --> 06:25.749
- Are you with the insurance investigators?
- No, I'm more of an independent contractor.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.673
- Can we speak in private?
- Sure.

06:30.067 --> 06:31.141
Thanks.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.120
Nice to meet you, too, Mr...

06:35.814 --> 06:37.548
Busybody Guy.

06:40.869 --> 06:43.663
- So what are these again?
- They're paper lanterns.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.173
Student Council made them
for after the memorial.

06:46.393 --> 06:48.321
You lite them up
in honor of all the dead.

06:48.447 --> 06:50.649
Nobody thought fire might
be a little inappropriate?

06:50.908 --> 06:52.750
Yeah, I wouldn't make
that crack in front of Elena.

06:54.326 --> 06:55.716
How is she?

06:57.968 --> 07:00.040
I guess she's fine...
considering.

07:00.459 --> 07:03.072
If there's anything I can do, you
know, short of giving her a ride,

07:03.101 --> 07:04.901
you'll let me know, right?

07:04.932 --> 07:07.334
I'm only alive because she
told Stefan to save me first.

07:07.685 --> 07:10.052
She's a vampire because
of me, so I'd like to...

07:10.557 --> 07:12.420
pay it back or forward or whatever.

07:12.872 --> 07:13.963
Yeah.

07:15.749 --> 07:16.865
Jeremy?

07:19.021 --> 07:21.372
Picture an emo pixie cut and braces.

07:22.410 --> 07:23.975
- April?
- Yeah.

07:24.005 --> 07:26.315
Oh, you look great. Do you
remember April? Elena used to...

07:26.346 --> 07:28.067
Elena used to baby-sit
you, yeah, I remember.

07:28.196 --> 07:31.161
Yeah, before I got shipped off
to boarding school by my dad.

07:31.190 --> 07:32.648
Your dad.

07:33.204 --> 07:35.367
Oh, my God, I am so
sorry about your dad.

07:36.221 --> 07:37.076
Thank you.

07:38.183 --> 07:39.764
I guess. I sort of...

07:39.795 --> 07:42.129
don't know how to answer
when people say that.

07:43.428 --> 07:46.245
- Your dad was Pastor Young, right?
- He of the faulty gas line.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.584
Sorry. I haven't figured out
what to say about that yet, either.

07:52.579 --> 07:54.435
Wow, I am being a freak.

07:55.050 --> 07:57.903
I'm just, you know,
not much for grief,

07:58.269 --> 07:59.834
I guess.

08:01.101 --> 08:04.031
I have to go register...
or something. I think.

08:08.108 --> 08:10.098
Hey, Care, it's me.

08:10.204 --> 08:11.911
I'm back. I...

08:12.656 --> 08:14.257
Can you call me?

08:14.858 --> 08:16.574
I've been having some...

08:17.189 --> 08:18.879
adjustment issues.

08:21.858 --> 08:22.817
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:24.048 --> 08:26.394
- Well, what's that for?
- This

08:26.838 --> 08:28.721
is from the year you were born.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.249
I think we should celebrate.

08:32.277 --> 08:35.004
- Celebrate what?
- Your first feed.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.130
I know it was disgusting

08:38.390 --> 08:40.549
and traumatic and it was horrible.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.260
But you did it anyway.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.668
- You survived it.
- Well, um...

08:46.379 --> 08:48.390
I wouldn't say I survived it.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.423
It actually kind
of made me sick.

08:50.452 --> 08:53.581
Listen, I choked it down for a month
before I could stomach the taste.

08:53.918 --> 08:55.528
It gets easier.

08:55.951 --> 08:57.692
This, on the other hand,

08:57.825 --> 08:59.610
will go down like silk.

09:02.326 --> 09:04.054
You're so cheery.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.914
Yeah, because
you're here. You're...

09:06.408 --> 09:08.202
alive. Ish.

09:08.695 --> 09:11.456
And, uh, you're going...
you're going to get through this.

09:13.691 --> 09:15.854
So, would you like
to do the honors?

09:17.701 --> 09:18.712
Ok.

09:24.465 --> 09:25.511
Oh, my God.

09:29.734 --> 09:30.975
Cheers.

09:39.327 --> 09:41.841
Ah, perfect timing, Damon.

09:42.519 --> 09:44.341
Yeah, we just got back.

09:44.878 --> 09:45.823
What?

09:46.249 --> 09:48.158
- Did you do it?
- That seat's taken.

09:49.311 --> 09:51.259
- But there's no one here.
- Well, I'm going to pretend

09:51.289 --> 09:54.834
like there's someone there. Because the
alternative's just too damn depressing.

09:58.282 --> 10:00.513
Did you set off the explosion
that killed the town Council?

10:00.543 --> 10:03.383
Am I wearing my "I blew
up the Council" t-shirt?

10:03.524 --> 10:05.214
Why does everybody
keep asking me that?

10:05.352 --> 10:06.760
- Did you?
- No.

10:07.158 --> 10:08.672
Anything else?

10:11.828 --> 10:13.893
Yes. Something's wrong.

10:15.341 --> 10:17.730
I can't keep any of
the animal blood down.

10:17.866 --> 10:19.595
Well, there's a shock.

10:20.572 --> 10:22.437
I think I need your help.

10:23.509 --> 10:26.333
Of course you do.
Pick your meal.

10:26.576 --> 10:29.124
You got Asian fusion, Mexican,

10:29.153 --> 10:31.404
what about some good
old American comfort food?

10:31.942 --> 10:34.418
No. No human blood.

10:34.448 --> 10:36.294
Stefan's right.
I have to at least...

10:36.325 --> 10:38.567
try to get through this
without hurting anyone.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.260
Fine. Come on.

10:50.565 --> 10:52.349
What are you doing?

10:52.682 --> 10:55.033
Giving you what you need. Drink.

10:55.190 --> 10:57.102
- What?!
- You're a new vampire, Elena.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.330
You need warm blood from the vein.
Maybe this will do the trick.

11:00.518 --> 11:03.254
Or not, but just
don't tell Stefan.

11:03.791 --> 11:06.735
- Why not?
- Because blood sharing is kind of...

11:07.238 --> 11:09.480
- personal.
- What do you mean it's personal?

11:09.509 --> 11:10.916
Just drink!

11:19.355 --> 11:23.717
<i>* Don't wanna live in fear and loathing *</i>

11:24.123 --> 11:28.397

11:28.855 --> 11:33.192
<i>* Instead of constantly exploding *</i>

11:35.594 --> 11:38.537
<i>* In fear and loathing *</i>

11:41.599 --> 11:45.091
This is wrong. A bunch of people
died and we're having sex.

11:46.094 --> 11:48.654
- Grief sex. It's healthy.
- It's selfish.

11:48.794 --> 11:50.136
It's natural.

11:50.735 --> 11:53.594
Besides, if we stopped having sex
every time somebody died in this town,

11:53.817 --> 11:55.533
we'd explode.

11:55.956 --> 11:57.918
We need to be more sensitive.

11:58.428 --> 11:59.413
Tyler.

11:59.942 --> 12:01.244
Oh, come on.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.235
I love you.

12:07.763 --> 12:09.576
How's that for sensitive?

12:13.904 --> 12:15.514
I love you, too.

12:25.028 --> 12:26.778
Who the hell is that?

12:28.870 --> 12:30.325
- May I help you?
- Good evening.

12:30.456 --> 12:32.293
I'm hoping I can
help you, actually.

12:32.323 --> 12:35.302
I spoke with Sheriff Forbes earlier.
My name is Connor Jordan.

12:36.504 --> 12:39.126
Carol Lockwood.
I know who you are, Connor.

12:39.275 --> 12:43.326
I think the Sheriff made it clear that the
tragedy at the farm was an internal matter.

12:43.571 --> 12:45.713
That's one way
of looking at it, I guess.

12:46.235 --> 12:48.124
Although I prefer
the term "cover-up".

12:48.802 --> 12:50.328
Do you mind if I come in?

12:50.359 --> 12:52.171
You know, I really don't
think that's a good idea.

12:52.461 --> 12:54.344
- Excuse me!
- Thank you.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.447
You're aware that
it wasn't an accident.

12:56.701 --> 12:58.408
Any rookie fireman
could tell you that.

12:58.438 --> 13:00.184
- What are you, the press?
- Not exactly.

13:00.445 --> 13:02.903
So 12 Council members are dead.

13:03.239 --> 13:05.393
You're the Mayor.
Why weren't you at that meeting?

13:05.533 --> 13:07.984
- It wasn't official town business.
- What was it, then?

13:08.605 --> 13:09.528
Mom?

13:12.230 --> 13:13.773
What's going on?

13:17.495 --> 13:19.376
Is there something
I can help you with?

13:19.504 --> 13:21.288
Maybe. How you doing?
I'm Connor.

13:25.448 --> 13:26.381
Tyler!

13:27.244 --> 13:29.213
Oh, my God!
Tyler!

13:30.244 --> 13:31.921
Oh, my God!

13:34.552 --> 13:36.100
Tyler, run!

13:53.721 --> 13:55.692
Please tell me that's the last one.

13:56.959 --> 13:58.798
These were specially carved.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.375
The length, the width.

14:02.340 --> 14:04.421
If you were a normal
vampire, you would be dead.

14:06.461 --> 14:08.336
This guy knew what he was doing.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.352
His gloves must have
been steeped in vervain.

14:12.179 --> 14:15.437
He was looking for a vampire and he didn't
hesitate for a second when he found one.

14:15.591 --> 14:17.470
These etchings...

14:19.655 --> 14:22.143
- Are the bullets spelled?
- I don't know.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.796
They're something.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.315
How are you feeling?
You look a little, uh,

14:37.014 --> 14:38.573
strong out.

14:39.498 --> 14:41.552
I'm fine. It's just my...

14:41.951 --> 14:44.309
emotions are all over the place.

14:45.154 --> 14:46.940
Everything's heightened.

14:47.635 --> 14:48.937
I mean,

14:49.174 --> 14:51.722
just the sight of all the
names of the dead makes me...

14:52.158 --> 14:55.052
- want to cry for a week.
- You didn't have to volunteer.

14:55.787 --> 14:57.494
People died.

14:57.907 --> 15:00.606
People we've known
our whole lives. So...

15:01.668 --> 15:03.471
Yeah, I did.

15:04.844 --> 15:06.302
Is that...?

15:06.850 --> 15:08.566
April Young, yeah.

15:21.033 --> 15:22.693
- Hey there.
- Hey.

15:23.048 --> 15:24.732
Long time, no see.

15:24.763 --> 15:26.884
- Not since...
- My parents' funeral.

15:27.869 --> 15:28.908
Yeah.

15:35.971 --> 15:37.750
Are you going to survive this?

15:38.128 --> 15:39.913
They want me to speak.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.477
I guess all the kids
who lost somebody can.

15:44.014 --> 15:45.764
What am I supposed to say?

15:45.794 --> 15:47.917
"I'm sorry my dad
didn't fix the gas line."?

15:51.120 --> 15:53.828
But if I don't say anything, then...

15:56.511 --> 15:58.270
I mean, what if nobody does?

15:59.081 --> 16:01.509
I mean, my dad and I didn't always
get along or anything, but...

16:02.096 --> 16:04.136
everybody still deserves
to have nice things

16:04.167 --> 16:06.041
said about them at their
own funeral, you know?

16:06.331 --> 16:08.477
I mean, for my mom's
funeral, everybody said

16:08.855 --> 16:10.509
some really nice things. I...

16:12.131 --> 16:13.847
You say what you want to say.

16:14.331 --> 16:16.019
Or you don't say
anything at all.

16:16.152 --> 16:17.868
And don't worry
about your dad.

16:18.447 --> 16:20.269
Everyone in this town loved him.

16:20.692 --> 16:21.745
Yeah.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.607
Until two days ago.

16:26.523 --> 16:27.740
Even still.

16:46.860 --> 16:49.515
I'm sorry, I... I have to go.

17:24.165 --> 17:25.300
Bonnie?

17:27.294 --> 17:30.180
Bonnie, I know you're in there.
I can hear you breathing.

17:30.699 --> 17:32.528
Bonnie, please, it's important.

17:42.888 --> 17:44.957
Hey. Are you all right?

17:49.897 --> 17:51.640
Can I come in, please?

17:54.675 --> 17:56.425
Hey, hey.

17:57.763 --> 18:00.615
My grams, it was like
she was dying all over again.

18:00.964 --> 18:03.605
Just because I didn't listen to
her about not doing black magic.

18:03.634 --> 18:05.454
Well, you're dealing
with the other side.

18:05.577 --> 18:07.337
It's not reliable.

18:07.654 --> 18:10.246
Witches were probably just messing with
your head, trying to teach you a lesson.

18:10.276 --> 18:13.474
Well, it worked. I tried to do
a basic nature spell this morning,

18:13.505 --> 18:15.326
just to clear my head, and...

18:16.394 --> 18:18.067
It just brought it all back.

18:18.523 --> 18:20.363
Like it was happening all over again.

18:21.594 --> 18:23.096
I'm sorry. I'm a mess.

18:23.126 --> 18:25.256
I've been holed up in here,
avoiding everyone.

18:25.286 --> 18:27.921
I've completely blown off Jamie.

18:31.643 --> 18:33.613
You came here 'cause
you needed something,

18:34.411 --> 18:36.698
- right?
- Yeah. But it can wait.

18:36.834 --> 18:38.538
Oh, come on, Stefan, I'm ok.

18:38.568 --> 18:40.548
Come on. You're not exactly
a drop by kind of guy. It just...

18:41.015 --> 18:42.871
If something's wrong, tell me.

18:43.294 --> 18:44.414
All right.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.576
These burn to the touch.

18:49.244 --> 18:51.172
Could just be steeped in vervain,

18:51.432 --> 18:54.258
but this writing... Have you ever
seen anything like this before?

18:55.510 --> 18:58.386
No, it's not magical writing,
if that's what you're thinking.

19:00.023 --> 19:02.970
- Where'd you get these?
- Think we've a new vampire hunter in town.

19:04.603 --> 19:06.282
That's bad timing.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.215
I'm here, I'm here.
Where are you?

19:09.386 --> 19:11.119
I'm in the basement bathroom.

19:14.788 --> 19:16.689
- Is that you at the door?
- Not yet.

19:19.751 --> 19:21.457
I'm sorry, there's someone in here.

19:21.586 --> 19:23.328
Damon, hurry.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.425
Oh, you again.

19:37.685 --> 19:39.638
Stalking small town funerals?

19:40.730 --> 19:42.788
Oh, Damon. Thank God.

19:45.242 --> 19:48.729
Sorry, I spilled coffee
all over my dress.

19:55.055 --> 19:58.406
We have not met.
I'm Connor. Jordan.

19:58.810 --> 20:00.532
Damon. Germaphobe.

20:01.125 --> 20:03.675
- Everything ok in there?
- Yeah. Just a minute!

20:10.993 --> 20:12.727
So what brings you
to Mystic Falls?

20:13.105 --> 20:14.663
Bible salesman?

20:15.321 --> 20:18.296
No, no, actually I'm in, uh,
environmental clean-up.

20:19.728 --> 20:21.981
Heard you had a bit
of a pollution problem.

20:24.550 --> 20:26.355
Well, I was unaware.

20:26.952 --> 20:28.597
I breathe pretty easy.

20:31.184 --> 20:33.635
- I'm so sorry that took so long.
- No problem.

20:33.798 --> 20:37.385
Well, enjoy your stay. We love
visitors, and the scenery is to die for.

20:38.951 --> 20:40.861
Funeral parlor.
Too soon.

20:41.017 --> 20:42.223
Sorry.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.434
Sorry, you scared me.

20:55.464 --> 20:57.820
I was just practicing
my speech for later.

21:10.868 --> 21:13.367
- Did you bring the blood bag?
- Do you want to say that a little louder?

21:22.826 --> 21:23.934
Elena!

21:25.615 --> 21:28.155
No, I can't. It tastes like...

21:30.133 --> 21:31.999
- What's wrong with me?
- I don't know.

21:32.127 --> 21:34.499
Maybe it's your doppelganger blood,
you're rejecting the transition.

21:35.959 --> 21:37.979
- I'm dying, aren't I?
- No, you're not dying.

21:38.009 --> 21:40.363
- You just need to drink from the vein.
- No.

21:41.011 --> 21:43.458
No, no. I can't risk
killing anyone, Damon.

21:45.041 --> 21:47.972
- Maybe I'm better off dead.
- Don't even think like that, Elena.

21:49.186 --> 21:50.815
You'll be fine.

21:51.896 --> 21:52.982
Ok?

22:02.325 --> 22:04.173
I have to get back inside.

22:16.855 --> 22:18.667
Oh, great.

22:19.382 --> 22:21.141
What's in the bag, Damon?

22:21.844 --> 22:23.923
Mid-service snack. Church
always gets me hungry.

22:23.952 --> 22:25.837
The whole blood
of Christ thing, you know.

22:27.307 --> 22:29.156
I brought it for Elena.

22:29.702 --> 22:32.605
- U're really that intent on having ur way?
- It's not my way, it's the only way.

22:32.635 --> 22:35.822
If she hurts someone, she'll be
desperate to turn the guilt off.

22:35.852 --> 22:37.933
Maybe even desperate enough
to shut off her humanity.

22:38.193 --> 22:40.038
What, and become a ripper?

22:40.796 --> 22:43.967
- We can't let her be anything like me.
- Or God forbid she's anything like me.

22:44.333 --> 22:47.152
That's really what you're thinking.
She's going to go off the rails

22:47.286 --> 22:49.826
eventually anyway, Stefan, so the
faster we can make that happen,

22:49.855 --> 22:51.492
the sooner we can
get her back on track.

22:51.624 --> 22:53.478
She's strong. If we help
her, she can survive.

22:53.508 --> 22:55.271
She's starving, Stefan.

22:55.301 --> 22:57.278
She hasn't been able to
keep blood down for days.

22:57.421 --> 22:59.413
- What? She told me she was fine.
- Well, she lied.

22:59.557 --> 23:01.368
Your four-legged protein
shake was a bust.

23:01.660 --> 23:04.571
The juice box was a no-go.
She can't even keep my blood down.

23:06.528 --> 23:08.259
She drank from you?

23:08.502 --> 23:10.342
Oops. Did I say that out loud?

23:23.590 --> 23:25.059
Are you ok?

23:25.569 --> 23:27.441
Hey, April was looking for you.

23:27.721 --> 23:29.719
She wanted help with her speech.

23:31.057 --> 23:32.578
Where is she?

23:35.125 --> 23:36.643
I don't know.

23:40.020 --> 23:42.999
- What are you doing here, Tyler?
- Being sensitive to the community's loss.

23:43.788 --> 23:45.507
With a hunter out to get you?

23:45.537 --> 23:48.045
I'm not letting a hunter stop me
from where I'm supposed to be.

23:48.626 --> 23:51.653
Also, if he shows his face,
I'm going to kick his ass.

23:57.609 --> 23:59.885
Before we begin the mass,
we'd like to open the floor

23:59.915 --> 24:02.175
to anyone who would
like to store a memory

24:02.489 --> 24:04.729
about our late friends
on the town Council.

24:04.989 --> 24:08.356
I know that April Young wanted
to say a few words about her dad.

24:08.616 --> 24:09.949
April?

24:11.198 --> 24:13.354
April? Are you still here, honey?

24:15.659 --> 24:17.509
Is there anyone else
who would like to...

24:17.539 --> 24:20.615
share a recollection or a
memory about Pastor Young?

24:37.605 --> 24:39.430
Come on up, Elena.

24:53.076 --> 24:55.126
Don't know why that
always makes me smile.

24:59.347 --> 25:00.796
She doesn't look so good.

25:00.826 --> 25:03.693
Maybe you should have told me
she was rejecting all food sources.

25:04.617 --> 25:06.327
Jealousy's beneath you, brother.

25:06.357 --> 25:07.803
Oh, bite me.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.148
I, um,

25:09.553 --> 25:12.549
when I talked to April earlier,
she was kind of nervous about...

25:13.953 --> 25:15.798
coming up to speak, and...

25:17.654 --> 25:19.757
Now that I'm up here,
I'm kind of nervous, too.

25:25.836 --> 25:27.596
The worst day

25:28.766 --> 25:32.097
of loving someone is the
day that you lose them.

25:38.833 --> 25:40.684
Do you smell that?

25:41.644 --> 25:42.927
Blood.

25:45.857 --> 25:47.498
Nobody move.

25:47.743 --> 25:49.740
Don't turn around. It's a trap.

26:05.307 --> 26:06.695
I, um...

26:14.498 --> 26:15.817
It's ok. It's ok.

26:15.847 --> 26:17.568
I got you, I got you.

26:23.710 --> 26:26.502
Please turn to page 42
in your hymn book.

26:26.632 --> 26:28.690
Let us join together in song.

26:30.686 --> 26:36.819
<i>* My life flows on in endless song *</i>

26:37.633 --> 26:38.701
Hey, hey, hey.

26:39.419 --> 26:41.692
The blood. Stefan, the blood.

26:41.722 --> 26:44.027
- I can smell it. There's so much.
- It's all right.

26:44.516 --> 26:46.363
It's all right, just remember
what we talked about.

26:46.714 --> 26:49.407
Focus, push back.
Come on, you can do this.

26:50.305 --> 26:51.947
What's wrong with her?

26:51.977 --> 26:53.799
She's hungry.
She hasn't fed.

26:54.059 --> 26:56.677
- So get her out of here.
- We can't. There's somebody watching us.

26:57.085 --> 26:58.832
I'm going to go
rip his head off now.

26:58.862 --> 27:01.426
You do that, Damon, and
you risk exposing all of us.

27:01.457 --> 27:04.241
Well, I think the risk will be
slightly diminished when I...

27:04.613 --> 27:06.269
you know, rip his head off.

27:06.405 --> 27:08.231
Stefan, I'm losing it.

27:12.303 --> 27:15.240
You have ten seconds before I
go old-fashioned on the new guy.

27:15.373 --> 27:17.994
- Don't do it, Damon, please.
- three, two, one, bye.

27:18.108 --> 27:21.202
Wait, wait, wait, Elena.
Feed from me.

27:25.288 --> 27:27.971
It's ok. Everyone will just think
you're upset. Feed from me.

27:30.161 --> 27:34.577
<i>* I know the truth it liveth *</i>

27:35.044 --> 27:40.012
<i>* And though the darkness
'round me close *</i>

27:40.144 --> 27:42.140
It's ok. You're ok.

27:42.281 --> 27:43.204
<i>* Songs in the night it giveth *</i>

27:43.205 --> 27:44.691
<i>I'm here.
* Songs in the night it giveth *</i>

27:44.692 --> 27:48.469
<i>* Songs in the night it giveth *</i>

27:48.653 --> 27:55.577
<i>* No storm can shake my inmost calm *</i>

27:55.607 --> 28:00.631
<i>* While to that rock I'm clinging *</i>

28:01.000 --> 28:07.993
<i>* Since love is Lord
of heaven and earth *</i>

28:08.448 --> 28:09.459
<i>Thank you.
* How can I keep from singing *</i>

28:09.460 --> 28:14.631
<i>* How can I keep from singing *</i>

28:20.282 --> 28:22.013
I'm ok.

28:22.542 --> 28:25.057
The blood, I can so smell it.

28:25.189 --> 28:27.967
It's got to be April.
We have to help her.

28:28.134 --> 28:29.857
Elena, we can't risk it.

28:29.990 --> 28:31.792
- Then I'm going to do it.
- Excuse me.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.978
I just wanted to say a few
words about Pastor Young.

28:38.295 --> 28:39.958
What do we do?

28:42.673 --> 28:44.358
Back in first grade,

28:44.503 --> 28:46.913
I was a brat who couldn't be
bothered with team sports.

28:47.292 --> 28:49.642
Didn't care much about
anything that didn't affect me.

28:50.249 --> 28:52.001
But he was the one
who made me understand

28:52.261 --> 28:54.846
how important it is
to be part of a team,

28:55.347 --> 28:56.980
a community.

28:57.423 --> 28:59.300
Of giving yourself up
for the sake of...

29:13.134 --> 29:14.383
Oh, my God!

29:27.076 --> 29:29.316
- I'm going to kill that bastard.
- Damon's way ahead of you.

29:29.346 --> 29:31.760
- Stay here, I have to help him.
- What about April?

29:31.790 --> 29:33.359
I got it, go.

29:34.701 --> 29:36.903
- I have to call an ambulance.
- No, he's fine!

29:36.933 --> 29:38.820
The whole town just
watched you get shot.

29:39.080 --> 29:40.865
I'm calling an ambulance.

29:41.952 --> 29:43.068
Elena?

29:59.173 --> 30:00.053
Damon!

30:15.608 --> 30:17.538
What the hell was that for?

30:17.795 --> 30:19.536
You know what.

30:24.125 --> 30:25.307
April!

30:39.182 --> 30:42.205
She's not dead, but if you
feed on her, you will kill her.

30:42.236 --> 30:44.162
- Let go of me!
- Look at her! Look at her, Elena.

30:44.192 --> 30:46.083
It's April. April Young.

30:46.113 --> 30:48.843
She's not a warm body for you
to feed on. She's your friend.

30:50.594 --> 30:51.817
Hey.

30:57.650 --> 31:00.218
She's an orphan, just like you.

31:01.414 --> 31:03.261
And she's scared...

31:05.002 --> 31:06.719
just like you were.

31:17.519 --> 31:19.384
Please!
Don't hurt me, please!

31:19.515 --> 31:22.086
No one's going to hurt you.
No one's going to hurt you.

31:30.213 --> 31:32.035
She needs you.

31:32.369 --> 31:34.112
You can make her forget all of this.

31:34.577 --> 31:36.373
Why did he do this?

31:38.038 --> 31:40.832
No, I... I can't, Caroline,
you have to do it.

31:40.862 --> 31:42.990
No, the only way you're going
to learn is if you do it yourself.

31:43.394 --> 31:45.507
- No, I can't...
- Yes, you can.

31:46.165 --> 31:48.394
You just need to believe
what you're telling her.

32:01.010 --> 32:02.558
April, listen to me.

32:03.869 --> 32:05.840
Everything's going to be ok.

32:07.803 --> 32:10.972
You're going to get through
this, just like I got through it.

32:11.666 --> 32:14.684
I'm going to help you. I promise.

32:16.816 --> 32:18.654
I'm going to be ok.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.407
You're going to help me.

32:28.942 --> 32:31.501
You watched the funeral from up
here so that you could grieve alone.

32:33.973 --> 32:36.115
It was a beautiful service.

32:37.347 --> 32:39.250
People said really nice things.

32:45.021 --> 32:47.718
That was insane. How do you
think they'll cover this one up?

32:47.978 --> 32:50.090
An assassination attempt
on the Mayor's son?

32:50.407 --> 32:52.281
"Altar boy goes postal."

32:53.205 --> 32:54.138
Hey.

32:55.652 --> 32:57.586
What happened there?

33:00.340 --> 33:02.191
Girlfriend went a little overboard.

33:09.724 --> 33:11.589
Nice ink.

33:15.741 --> 33:18.210
- What ink?
- You didn't see his tattoo?

33:18.240 --> 33:20.469
- It was huge.
- He didn't have a tattoo.

33:20.799 --> 33:22.595
Yeah, he did.

33:47.185 --> 33:49.498
<i>"Dear April, I'm sorry for
what you're going through.</i>

33:50.682 --> 33:52.596
<i>What I did was
a necessary sacrifice,</i>

33:52.625 --> 33:55.740
<i>and I'm afraid it's only the first
of many more sacrifices to come.</i>

33:56.306 --> 33:58.852
<i>There's always been an evil
that spread through Mystic Falls,</i>

33:58.882 --> 34:00.781
<i>but now a greater one is coming.</i>

34:01.195 --> 34:03.439
<i>My death is but the
first in the war ahead.</i>

34:04.173 --> 34:06.458
<i>I will see you again when
we all find our salvation.</i>

34:06.887 --> 34:08.876
<i>Until then, I love you.</i>

34:09.518 --> 34:10.920
<i>Dad."</i>

34:23.945 --> 34:25.835
Helps with the cravings.

34:34.905 --> 34:36.971
- You're mad.
- Yeah, I'm mad.

34:38.286 --> 34:39.931
You lied to me.

34:40.262 --> 34:42.608
- I didn't lie, I just didn't tell you...
- Come on, Elena,

34:42.637 --> 34:44.114
you lied to me.

34:46.297 --> 34:49.376
You were just so happy that
things were going well, and, and...

34:49.516 --> 34:52.085
- You think I'm happy?
- I just didn't want to ruin it for you.

34:52.226 --> 34:54.576
You're in hell, which
means that I'm in hell.

34:56.268 --> 34:58.186
And then you go to Damon for help.

35:03.496 --> 35:05.521
Yeah, because I thought
that he would understand.

35:05.652 --> 35:07.460
- You think I don't?
- Stefan, please...

35:07.490 --> 35:10.813
You fed on him, Elena.
You fed on him.

35:11.411 --> 35:14.275
I know that may not mean much
to you, but it means a lot to me.

35:16.152 --> 35:17.987
And I know it certainly
meant a lot to Damon.

35:21.264 --> 35:24.255
I didn't want to hurt you.
I'm... I'm sorry. I...

35:25.047 --> 35:27.856
Look, I'm really, really sorry, I...

35:30.425 --> 35:32.298
Why am I crying?

35:32.429 --> 35:34.476
I am so sick of crying!

35:35.505 --> 35:37.739
Your emotions are a bit
heightened right now.

35:37.889 --> 35:40.760
I feel like I've been crying
since the day that my parents died.

35:40.896 --> 35:42.547
My life is...

35:42.731 --> 35:44.648
It's like a never ending funeral.

35:47.438 --> 35:49.409
We keep burying people, Stefan.

35:50.208 --> 35:52.065
You want to know
what's heightened?

35:52.487 --> 35:55.050
It's grief. I can't stop
feeling everyone's grief.

35:55.840 --> 35:58.396
All the hurt, I feel like it's trying to...

35:58.610 --> 36:00.545
explode out of me.

36:01.320 --> 36:02.869
Hey, hey.

36:04.543 --> 36:05.786
Come on.

36:07.755 --> 36:09.164
Come with me.

36:09.981 --> 36:11.090
Where?

36:12.172 --> 36:14.563
Something we need to do.
Come on.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.409
- What are we doing here?
- I don't know.

36:25.565 --> 36:27.563
- Ask Stefan.
- Stefan.

36:28.690 --> 36:29.961
What are we doing?

36:29.992 --> 36:32.112
We're finishing the memorial
we didn't get to have earlier.

36:34.157 --> 36:36.021
We need to start healing, Damon.

36:36.050 --> 36:38.025
We've all lost so much,
especially recently.

36:38.286 --> 36:40.291
I think we're numb to it.

36:41.128 --> 36:43.277
We push it away,
we make a joke out of it,

36:43.911 --> 36:45.766
ignore how we feel...

36:46.735 --> 36:48.574
Time to just let ourselves grieve.

36:50.659 --> 36:52.925
- So you're lighting lanterns.
- Yeah.

36:53.467 --> 36:55.530
- Yeah, we need to do this.
- What we need to do

36:55.561 --> 36:58.672
is find out who this hunter is and what
he knows about the death of the Council.

36:58.806 --> 37:01.884
We have more important things
to be doing right now than this.

37:02.034 --> 37:03.911
Not tonight, we don't.

37:10.112 --> 37:12.119
This is for my Uncle Zach.

37:13.887 --> 37:15.748
My friend Lexi.

37:16.826 --> 37:18.427
For Alaric.

37:25.956 --> 37:27.487
This is for Vickie.

37:36.556 --> 37:38.333
This is for my dad.

37:38.625 --> 37:40.454
And Tyler's.

37:40.483 --> 37:46.302
<i>* Don't talk, don't say a thing *</i>

37:47.583 --> 37:49.552
<i>* Cause your eyes *</i>

37:49.561 --> 37:52.391
<i>This is for our parents, for Vickie...
* They tell me more than your words *</i>

37:52.391 --> 37:54.637
<i>* They tell me more than your words *</i>

37:54.778 --> 37:55.867
Anna.

37:56.134 --> 37:57.224
Jenna.

37:57.980 --> 37:59.885
<i>* Don't go *</i>

37:59.914 --> 38:01.014
And Alaric.

38:01.045 --> 38:04.112
<i>* Don't leave me now *</i>

38:05.264 --> 38:06.891
<i>* Cause they say the best way out *</i>

38:06.891 --> 38:08.271
<i>No way. I'm not doing that.
* Cause they say the best way out *</i>

38:08.273 --> 38:10.059
<i>* Cause they say the best way out *</i>

38:10.666 --> 38:12.996
<i>* Is through *</i>

38:15.119 --> 38:21.155
<i>* And I am short on words
knowing what's occurred *</i>

38:21.186 --> 38:25.695
<i>* She begins to leave because of me *</i>

38:26.099 --> 38:31.336
<i>* Her bag is now much heavier *</i>

38:31.943 --> 38:33.693
<i>This is for my grams.
* I wish that I could carry her *</i>

38:33.695 --> 38:37.320
<i>* I wish that I could carry her *</i>

38:37.530 --> 38:43.867
<i>* But this is our ungodly hour *</i>

38:44.818 --> 38:46.128
This, um...

38:47.150 --> 38:49.469
is for my mom,

38:49.876 --> 38:51.653
my dad, and...

38:52.452 --> 38:53.675
Jenna.

38:54.976 --> 38:57.000
Everyone that we've all lost.

38:57.467 --> 38:59.586
Everyone that this town has lost.

39:01.795 --> 39:03.333
And for me.

39:04.583 --> 39:05.929
I guess.

39:13.802 --> 39:19.487
<i>* And I am short on words
knowing what's occurred *</i>

39:19.516 --> 39:24.108
<i>* She begins to leave because of me *</i>

39:24.590 --> 39:29.648
<i>* Her bag is now much heavier *</i>

39:30.465 --> 39:35.876
<i>* I wish that I could carry her *</i>

39:36.000 --> 39:42.085
<i>* But this is our ungodly hour *</i>

39:43.590 --> 39:45.789
They're floating lanterns in the sky.

39:46.414 --> 39:48.050
Can you believe that?

39:48.583 --> 39:51.253
Japanese lantern is a symbol
of letting go of the past.

39:51.284 --> 39:53.152
Well, here's a newsflash...

39:53.362 --> 39:55.130
We're not Japanese.

39:58.237 --> 39:59.938
You know what they are?

40:00.722 --> 40:02.244
Children.

40:02.865 --> 40:05.121
Like lighting a candle's
going to make everything ok.

40:05.150 --> 40:06.789
Or even saying a prayer,

40:06.818 --> 40:10.472
or pretending Elena is not going to end up
just like the rest of us murderous vampires.

40:11.400 --> 40:13.159
Stupid, delusional,

40:13.293 --> 40:15.443
exasperating little children.

40:16.503 --> 40:18.336
I know what you're going to say.

40:19.340 --> 40:21.708
"It makes them feel better, Damon."
So what?

40:22.233 --> 40:24.688
For how long?
A minute? A day?

40:25.429 --> 40:27.215
What difference does it make?

40:27.831 --> 40:31.112
Because in the end,
when you lose somebody,

40:31.518 --> 40:34.942
every candle, every prayer is
not going to make up for the fact

40:34.943 --> 40:37.400
that the only thing
that you have left

40:38.376 --> 40:42.121
is a hole in your life where that somebody
that you cared about used to be.

40:43.724 --> 40:45.173
And a rock.

40:45.288 --> 40:47.847
With a birthday carved into it
that I'm pretty sure is wrong.

40:48.085 --> 40:53.135
<i>* And I am short on words
knowing what's occurred *</i>

40:54.271 --> 40:56.367
So, thanks, friend.

40:58.215 --> 41:00.204
Thanks for leaving me
here to baby-sit.

41:00.389 --> 41:02.715
Because I should be
long gone by now.

41:04.387 --> 41:07.088
I didn't get the girl.
Remember?

41:08.893 --> 41:11.175
I'm just stuck here
fighting with my brother

41:11.204 --> 41:13.032
and taking care of the kids.

41:15.793 --> 41:17.597
You owe me big.
