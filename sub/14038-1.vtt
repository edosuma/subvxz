WEBVTT

02:45.174 --> 02:47.802
Your Highness, we celebrate your victory.

02:49.262 --> 02:50.805
Try again next week, Ander?

02:51.055 --> 02:52.932
We are at your service.

02:59.105 --> 03:00.982
That was a stunning display, Thor.

03:03.234 --> 03:06.153
You were victorious,
despite the trouble with your sword's grip.

03:06.279 --> 03:09.282
- Trouble?
- Plainly, it was too slick.

03:09.407 --> 03:11.617
I'll reprimand the dwarves for you.

03:11.701 --> 03:12.994
Good idea.

03:22.587 --> 03:23.629
Sif.

03:25.590 --> 03:27.592
You missed seeing my victory.

03:27.675 --> 03:30.803
I left right after your opponents
threw you back your weapon.

03:32.972 --> 03:36.142
Well, there was a problem with the grip
due to the dwarves' habit of...

03:36.267 --> 03:40.021
So now you're blaming the dwarves.
Whose idea was that? Loki's?

03:40.146 --> 03:42.481
Are you saying
I shouldn't have won today's match?

03:42.690 --> 03:44.275
Not just today's.

03:48.196 --> 03:51.073
A comment like that
requires an explanation, Sif.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.868
I'll tell you what needs explaining, Thor.

03:53.951 --> 03:56.537
Why you have never once
ceded victory to the Einherjar,

03:56.662 --> 03:59.165
the most celebrated warriors in Asgard!

03:59.248 --> 04:01.209
I am simply more skilled than they.

04:01.292 --> 04:02.418
How can that be?

04:03.044 --> 04:05.880
They have battled the fiercest
creatures in all the nine realms,

04:05.963 --> 04:09.008
and you have never even
left the royal grounds.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.886
You forget I also have
the strength of Odin.

04:12.136 --> 04:16.349
Yes, and the authority.
They have no choice but to lose.

04:16.682 --> 04:19.267
Why do you have so little faith in me, Sif?

04:19.519 --> 04:22.188
I am the only one who has faith in you.

04:22.605 --> 04:25.566
Everyone else treats you
like a spoiled child!

04:25.650 --> 04:26.650
That is enough!

04:32.240 --> 04:35.201
You've never had
an honest fight in your life.

04:35.701 --> 04:39.038
Since you're a fair hand with a blade,

04:39.121 --> 04:42.208
perhaps you should
make an honest man out of me.

04:43.042 --> 04:45.044
Be careful how you jest.

04:45.336 --> 04:47.129
Choose your weapon, wench.

04:54.720 --> 04:59.433
A barn tool.
You think less of my skill than I realized.

05:14.490 --> 05:16.033
Good-bye, Thor.

05:19.871 --> 05:21.789
Thor was wrong about you, Sif.

05:22.039 --> 05:24.083
You'll fit right in with the Valkyries.

05:25.376 --> 05:29.839
You do your brother no favors, Loki.
Stop protecting him.

05:49.317 --> 05:50.317
There we were,

05:50.651 --> 05:53.696
clinging to the side of
a sheer mountain of ice,

05:54.322 --> 05:57.450
plumes of fire
billowing up from the gorge below.

05:59.493 --> 06:02.371
Fire? In Jtunheim?

06:02.497 --> 06:04.165
Dragons, love.

06:05.082 --> 06:06.584
How many were after you?

06:06.667 --> 06:08.294
- Seven.
- Ten.

06:08.377 --> 06:10.129
At least a dozen.

06:13.299 --> 06:16.469
And Frost Giants were
advancing on the horizon.

06:16.552 --> 06:18.679
There was no escape, but...

06:18.804 --> 06:23.226
But the Warriors Three would not be
so easily diverted from their quest,

06:24.185 --> 06:27.980
for the Sword of Surtur
is worth risking both life and limb.

06:31.943 --> 06:35.488
Well, look who it is! Greetings, Thor.

06:35.613 --> 06:38.324
Congratulations on your victory
in today's match.

06:38.658 --> 06:42.703
Of course, his victory pales to
those found outside the arena.

06:47.375 --> 06:50.878
Perhaps you'd like to
join us on our next quest, Thor.

06:51.003 --> 06:52.338
You know he can't, Hogun.

06:52.421 --> 06:54.215
He's not allowed to leave the kingdom.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.054
You dare mock the prince of Asgard?

07:00.179 --> 07:05.059
Thor, we speak only in jest.
We're friends, remember?

07:09.897 --> 07:12.191
What crawled into his keg?

07:18.030 --> 07:20.366
Your Eminence, we managed to learn

07:20.449 --> 07:22.785
that the Valkyries have
established a new training camp

07:22.910 --> 07:26.372
in the branches of Yggdrasill,
west of Svartalfheim.

07:28.249 --> 07:29.584
Father.

07:33.713 --> 07:36.507
Skala, how could you
come by this information

07:36.591 --> 07:39.427
when the scout tracking them
has failed to return?

07:39.969 --> 07:44.432
We were able to follow Brunhilde
after she had secretly met with Lady Sif.

07:45.975 --> 07:48.686
Thank you, all.
This concludes today's council.

07:49.604 --> 07:50.604
Gentlemen.

08:01.157 --> 08:04.160
Now, Son, tell me what troubles you.

08:04.452 --> 08:08.247
Father, I wish your permission to ride
with the Einherjar on one of their patrols.

08:08.498 --> 08:09.749
You know my answer.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.417
But I do not agree with it.

08:11.626 --> 08:14.754
You are the son of Odin, and, as such,

08:14.837 --> 08:17.757
you have different responsibilities
than that of a warrior.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.927
But at least a warrior knows
the true limits of his abilities.

08:21.177 --> 08:26.098
I see what brings you here.
You believe you've outgrown your training.

08:26.724 --> 08:31.229
Some say the Einherjar let me win, Father.
Is that true?

08:32.730 --> 08:33.940
Yes.

08:35.357 --> 08:36.357
Why?

08:36.442 --> 08:40.404
You chose to turn your training
into public entertainment.

08:40.696 --> 08:45.743
But this kingdom cannot afford to see
its prince defeated week after week.

08:46.035 --> 08:48.746
So you, too, doubt my abilities.

08:49.080 --> 08:53.084
Being a king is not about
drawing a sword in battle.

08:53.167 --> 08:55.628
It's about avoiding battle entirely.

08:55.795 --> 08:58.923
Hiding from conflict sounds more like
one of Loki's strengths.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.800
Perhaps he should inherit your throne.

09:01.008 --> 09:06.430
Perhaps he will. But as for you,
there will be no leaving Asgard.

09:06.514 --> 09:11.143
I am your king and your father,
and you will obey me.

09:37.170 --> 09:39.172
You may come out, Algrim.

09:42.258 --> 09:45.344
I'm impressed.
You have detected me in shadow.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.138
Not many can.

09:48.097 --> 09:50.683
Truth be told, I can't either.

09:50.766 --> 09:52.935
But I don't know of a time that
you didn't come and check on me

09:53.060 --> 09:55.146
after I had a fight with Father.

09:55.229 --> 09:59.358
Typically, because you would insist on
pursuing some sort of foolishness.

09:59.775 --> 10:04.071
And I always let you talk me out of it.
But not this time.

10:05.156 --> 10:10.203
Thor, where are you going
that you need such a weapon?

10:11.370 --> 10:14.749
Are you aware that there was
a test of manhood for young warriors?

10:15.208 --> 10:16.417
A secret quest.

10:16.542 --> 10:18.085
Yes, I know of it.

10:18.211 --> 10:23.216
It's a rite of passage.
Warriors pursue it every year. No one dies.

10:23.549 --> 10:26.552
Because the object of the quest
will never be found.

10:26.802 --> 10:29.764
The test is not
in finding the Sword of Surtur

10:29.847 --> 10:30.973
but in looking for it.

10:31.098 --> 10:34.936
So, it is the art of
trespassing you aspire to.

10:35.269 --> 10:38.022
Yes, it is. When it's in Jtunheim.

10:38.397 --> 10:43.402
Thor, our truce with the Frost Giants
is fragile at best.

10:43.778 --> 10:45.780
They must not find you in their realm.

10:46.239 --> 10:50.243
They won't.
You think too highly of those lumbering...

10:51.202 --> 10:54.664
Forgive me, Algrim.
That was thoughtless of me.

10:55.706 --> 10:57.500
Rest easy, Thor.

10:57.959 --> 11:03.464
But, if nothing else,
let my people's fate serve as an example.

11:03.923 --> 11:06.217
The Frost Giants are dangerous.

11:06.467 --> 11:10.513
I know. I promise to be vigilant.
And, Algrim,

11:10.638 --> 11:13.266
as always, this stays between us.

11:14.267 --> 11:17.854
I will remain silent for
as long as possible.

11:17.979 --> 11:20.523
Thank you. You are a good friend.

11:39.167 --> 11:40.751
I'm doing it.

11:41.627 --> 11:43.713
Now try your hand at influencing it.

11:44.505 --> 11:46.299
Keep it to three words.

11:54.724 --> 12:00.897
A spell's power is in its whisper.
A true master needs only to think it.

12:14.869 --> 12:16.662
You find humor in this?

12:16.913 --> 12:22.293
Loki, you granted magic to water.
It became a snake, and a snake bites.

12:22.919 --> 12:24.295
You did it perfectly.

12:24.378 --> 12:25.505
I did?

12:25.588 --> 12:28.049
Don't you know how amazing you are?

12:28.549 --> 12:32.470
Metal and rock are easy,
but to have an apprentice control water,

12:33.054 --> 12:37.600
it's a triple threat, for
it is also mist and ice.

12:38.768 --> 12:40.228
Amora.

12:44.065 --> 12:45.274
Leave us.

12:46.150 --> 12:47.860
Yes, Your Highness.

12:52.573 --> 12:53.950
Do you need something, Brother?

12:54.200 --> 12:56.869
Yes. How is your magic?

12:57.203 --> 12:59.664
It happens to be fairly advanced. Why?

13:00.081 --> 13:02.458
<i>Because we're stealing aboard
the Thunder Runner,</i>

13:02.583 --> 13:04.585
and we'll need your talents on our journey.

13:05.628 --> 13:07.713
I lied. I'm not very good.

13:20.601 --> 13:24.146
This is it.
We'll conceal ourselves in the hold.

13:24.438 --> 13:26.899
Conceal ourselves? From our friends?

13:27.275 --> 13:28.901
Friends who are not foolhardy enough

13:28.985 --> 13:31.696
to set sail with the sons of Odin
on their vessel.

13:31.779 --> 13:34.574
- Now make haste before...
- A mere seven days,

13:34.657 --> 13:38.578
though it will feel like an eternity
while in the throes of battle

13:38.703 --> 13:40.746
against the beasts of Jtunheim.

13:40.872 --> 13:43.416
Bring us something, won't you?

13:43.541 --> 13:48.337
Perhaps a claw or fang
of a savage white bear would please you.

14:22.330 --> 14:25.124
It's astonishing, Loki.

14:25.208 --> 14:27.710
This is a view of Asgard
like we've never seen.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.296
And one I never cared to see.

14:30.379 --> 14:31.756
You always fret.

14:32.131 --> 14:34.258
The Warriors Three have
returned from this adventure

14:34.342 --> 14:36.969
for the last three seasons
with nary a scratch.

14:37.553 --> 14:41.390
But we're royalty.
We're not equipped to handle adventure.

14:41.766 --> 14:45.686
Fear not, little brother,
for I am a skilled hand with a blade.

14:46.020 --> 14:47.438
I'll protect you.

14:48.397 --> 14:51.734
Sif was right. I've done him no favors.

14:57.490 --> 14:58.741
Algrim?

15:01.160 --> 15:03.162
Sire? Is there trouble?

15:03.496 --> 15:07.375
No. I'm just looking for my sons.
Have you seen them?

15:08.084 --> 15:10.127
Not for hours, my lord.

15:10.211 --> 15:14.131
But it is not uncommon for them to be away
from their chambers at this time of night.

15:15.216 --> 15:18.427
Sire, have you found
a reason to be concerned?

15:19.929 --> 15:21.556
Thor and I had an argument.

15:22.390 --> 15:26.811
Quarrels are to be expected.
He is nearing the age of adulthood.

15:27.186 --> 15:28.771
Yes, nearing.

15:29.230 --> 15:32.358
He has yet to arrive,
despite what he believes.

15:32.483 --> 15:34.610
I'm afraid he may have
done something foolish.

15:35.278 --> 15:37.864
You would think
that someone known as the "All Father"

15:37.947 --> 15:41.492
should possess the wisdom
to raise two boys.

15:41.576 --> 15:44.704
They are not your average boys, Sire.

15:45.413 --> 15:50.793
Algrim, am I a good father?
Do I shield them from too much?

15:51.460 --> 15:54.422
Though my children never had the chance

15:55.631 --> 15:57.175
to come of age,

15:57.925 --> 16:01.095
I do believe that keeping sons too close

16:01.304 --> 16:04.265
could very well be what drives them away.

16:05.474 --> 16:10.897
Some lessons, my lord,
can only be learned with real consequences.

16:11.772 --> 16:14.984
So, perhaps that is what
you can teach them now.

16:17.236 --> 16:22.450
Your counsel is wise, Algrim.
And, as always, appreciated.

16:34.420 --> 16:35.755
Loki, wake up.

16:36.380 --> 16:37.465
What?

16:37.590 --> 16:39.133
The ship lies still.

16:39.467 --> 16:41.344
We're in Jötunheim.

16:47.391 --> 16:49.435
Come back, and I'll kill you!

16:51.103 --> 16:52.813
It's smaller than I imagined.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.593
Say, love, do you know where
a gallant warrior like myself

17:22.676 --> 17:26.472
might purchase the claw or fang
of a savage white bear?

17:33.354 --> 17:34.897
Another round.

17:39.819 --> 17:41.988
Going after Nixies now, are you Fandral?

17:42.238 --> 17:43.823
Having established your standards,

17:43.948 --> 17:47.618
let's maybe try your hand at a nice,
plump hobgoblin girl.

17:49.203 --> 17:52.540
You jest, but in the
later hours, who knows?

17:54.792 --> 17:58.421
Change that grim face, Hogun,
or we'll make you go sit with the Greeks.

18:01.215 --> 18:03.843
Spending a half fortnight
in this rotting armpit,

18:03.968 --> 18:07.013
merely to steal stories,
has lost its charm.

18:07.388 --> 18:10.516
What hasn't lost its charm for you, Hogun?

18:21.986 --> 18:23.571
I believe I'll go turn in.

18:31.579 --> 18:33.623
We're about to get a new story.

18:33.748 --> 18:36.709
I'll secure us a little roasted
mystery meat, boys,

18:36.834 --> 18:39.504
while you two spread out
and see what can be overheard.

18:39.587 --> 18:41.506
Do you know the one about
the three explorers

18:41.589 --> 18:44.884
whose travels never took them
beyond an outpost inn?

18:47.261 --> 18:48.513
Hello, friends.

18:52.141 --> 18:56.729
Sire, what brings you
this far from the kingdom?

18:56.938 --> 19:00.733
<i>A drafty little bucket
named the Thunder Runner. Know of it?</i>

19:01.108 --> 19:03.778
You stowed away?

19:03.903 --> 19:05.655
Upon our vessel?

19:06.447 --> 19:07.698
It gets worse.

19:09.534 --> 19:11.953
And you brought Loki.

19:12.328 --> 19:14.705
We'll all be drawn and quartered.

19:16.332 --> 19:21.420
Relax. Lift your steins for a toast, lads.

19:21.504 --> 19:24.090
To frigid worlds and lost swords.

19:25.842 --> 19:27.677
You took my ale.

19:28.886 --> 19:32.473
You dare lay your foul-smelling paw
on the son of Odin?

19:35.476 --> 19:37.603
Stay your hands!

19:44.819 --> 19:46.404
Fenris.

19:54.328 --> 19:57.039
And I thought his paw was foul-smelling.

20:28.029 --> 20:29.447
Enough!

20:36.287 --> 20:39.665
Barkeep, some fiend is making off
with your cash box.

20:46.881 --> 20:48.174
Excuse me!

20:50.801 --> 20:52.762
Who started it?

20:52.887 --> 20:54.597
Does it ever matter?

21:16.536 --> 21:18.830
- Have you seen my sword?
- No.

21:19.580 --> 21:21.207
Let's look for it.

21:44.438 --> 21:47.024
Greetings, ladies. Perhaps later we can...

21:52.113 --> 21:55.366
Have you seen a sword?
Gold, bejeweled, perfectly balanced?

22:00.663 --> 22:02.415
Here, try this.

22:05.585 --> 22:06.919
Well, it's better than nothing.

22:17.763 --> 22:20.641
Did you use a little... You know.

22:21.225 --> 22:22.226
No.

22:29.942 --> 22:31.611
You're mine!

22:46.417 --> 22:48.336
That just breaks the heart.

22:49.754 --> 22:51.672
Come on, come on, come on.

23:19.033 --> 23:22.453
Well, lads, I'd say
that's enough adventure for one trip.

23:22.578 --> 23:23.578
Agreed.

23:24.789 --> 23:26.916
Then let's put about ship
and head for home.

23:27.041 --> 23:29.126
With charitable winds,
we can be there by morning.

23:29.544 --> 23:31.045
Nay, friends.

23:31.879 --> 23:34.173
We came in search of Surtur's sword,

23:34.674 --> 23:37.260
and we'll not return home until we find it.

23:39.053 --> 23:42.265
You heard my brother. On to Jötunheim.

24:01.409 --> 24:03.995
While I commend your aim, novice,

24:04.287 --> 24:07.790
it is evident that
one man has claim on your focus.

24:10.042 --> 24:11.961
My apologies, Brunhilde.

24:12.503 --> 24:14.046
No need to apologize.

24:14.672 --> 24:17.508
We've all joined the sisterhood
for similar reasons.

24:19.135 --> 24:21.012
But this is Konurlifandi,

24:21.888 --> 24:24.682
a place where we sever our reliance on men.

24:26.267 --> 24:29.520
Where we are free to
reach our true potential.

24:29.604 --> 24:31.981
Yes, ma'am. 'Tis why I've come here.

24:32.398 --> 24:34.734
Then I offer this advice, Sif.

24:34.859 --> 24:38.446
Men are useful for one reason
and one reason only.

24:38.571 --> 24:41.073
Beyond that, they should be disposed of.

24:41.782 --> 24:43.659
Now return to the line.

25:06.349 --> 25:09.352
I have to say, I'm close to weeping, lads.

25:09.477 --> 25:14.899
Aye. She was far from pretty,
but she did perform her duty well.

25:15.024 --> 25:17.360
A quality I've grown to appreciate.

25:17.485 --> 25:21.405
Gentlemen, why linger?
We have nowhere to go but onward.

25:41.175 --> 25:45.596
How can you whistle? My lips are frozen.

25:47.056 --> 25:49.642
I've never felt such cold in my life,

25:49.725 --> 25:52.478
yet you walk as if
crossing the spring meadow.

25:53.479 --> 25:55.273
There must be but one explanation.

25:55.356 --> 25:57.024
I'm tougher than you.

25:57.149 --> 26:01.737
Fine. Then I'll let you fend off
the first Frost Giant, little brother.

26:04.240 --> 26:07.034
Stand guard. I sense movement.

26:22.550 --> 26:27.096
Snow sprites. What would we do
without your keen senses, Hogun?

26:32.727 --> 26:35.521
Hey! Thieving little pest!

26:36.022 --> 26:39.984
Keep alert, friends!
Surtur's sword won't be looking for us.

27:18.523 --> 27:19.649
Thor?

27:28.282 --> 27:30.743
You're not giving up, are you, Brother?

27:30.868 --> 27:32.537
I fear Algrim's right.

27:32.620 --> 27:35.122
- About what?
- The sword.

27:35.248 --> 27:37.250
He said it will never be found.

27:37.375 --> 27:39.168
What does Algrim know of it?

27:39.627 --> 27:44.340
He knows Jötunheim well, Loki.
It claimed his people.

27:44.465 --> 27:46.551
It wiped them out as if they never existed.

27:46.676 --> 27:49.804
Nay, it was
the Frost Giants who claimed them.

27:49.929 --> 27:52.223
The land itself is not to blame.

27:52.431 --> 27:56.352
It matters not.
We hold no kinship with the ice.

27:56.477 --> 27:58.855
Therefore, its secrets are safe from us.

27:58.980 --> 28:01.566
Every secret has its clues.

28:03.943 --> 28:05.778
Do you recall the many tales of valor

28:05.903 --> 28:08.406
we were forced to commit to memory
as children?

28:08.489 --> 28:10.575
Yes. I love those stories.

28:11.117 --> 28:14.662
Verily. I can recite
Odin's great defeat of Surtur by heart.

28:14.996 --> 28:16.330
I, as well.

28:19.000 --> 28:24.922
Then you should recognize this valley.
'Tis where that defeat took place.

28:25.006 --> 28:29.385
Yes. Yes, I see it. It began there.

28:32.054 --> 28:35.725
<i>Father held the only weapon
that could rival Surtur's sword,</i>

28:36.142 --> 28:38.269
<i>his spear, Gungnir.</i>

28:44.775 --> 28:46.944
<i>Yet he bided his time.</i>

28:49.739 --> 28:54.327
A wise warrior, Father knew his only
hope was to tire the fire giant first.

28:54.452 --> 28:58.080
<i>So exhausted was Surtur,
that to lift his sword,</i>

28:59.040 --> 29:00.833
he needed both hands.

29:00.917 --> 29:03.002
- Thus exposing his chest.
- Thus exposing his chest.

29:17.225 --> 29:20.228
It must be there,
at the foot of that mountain.

29:44.752 --> 29:47.839
I cannot take another step.

29:51.717 --> 29:53.970
Stand guard. I hear something.

29:54.720 --> 30:00.184
What this time, Hogun? A moth? A cricket?
Perhaps a...

30:00.434 --> 30:02.270
Don't move.

30:22.582 --> 30:23.583
Enter.

30:27.795 --> 30:31.924
Sire, a visitor from the outer realm
seeks an audience.

30:32.341 --> 30:34.635
You manage affairs today, Algrim.

30:35.803 --> 30:39.432
I have been,
but this concerns Thor and Loki.

30:39.807 --> 30:40.808
Show him in.

30:50.067 --> 30:51.402
What news do you bring?

30:52.028 --> 30:57.867
News? I've come for compensation.
My dwelling was destroyed!

30:58.159 --> 31:00.119
And for what reason
do you seek payment here?

31:00.578 --> 31:03.414
Because the sons of Odin were responsible!

31:06.167 --> 31:08.211
One of them left this!

31:35.071 --> 31:38.157
Brother, over there.

31:50.878 --> 31:52.672
It's magnificent.

31:52.797 --> 31:55.299
And large. Very large!

31:55.675 --> 31:57.844
Who of us knew it would be that large?

31:57.969 --> 31:59.136
Not me.

31:59.220 --> 32:00.805
I'm very surprised.

32:00.888 --> 32:03.057
The dwarves called it Elderstahl.

32:03.474 --> 32:06.936
They fashioned it to
fit the hand of whoever wields it.

32:07.728 --> 32:09.355
Hogun, can you break it free?

32:09.897 --> 32:12.733
Aye. Stand back.

33:29.101 --> 33:30.353
Brother?

33:30.478 --> 33:32.563
I've never felt such power.

33:32.813 --> 33:36.275
This has moved beyond a harmless quest.

33:36.359 --> 33:39.278
We must not be found in Jötunheim
with such a weapon.

33:39.654 --> 33:43.950
Why be concerned, Loki?
I defy anyone to confront us,

33:44.033 --> 33:46.786
especially now that we are armed with this.

34:16.023 --> 34:19.777
We must return to Asgard with due haste.

34:19.860 --> 34:23.489
Agreed, but for that,
we must first make our way north.

34:24.364 --> 34:25.491
North?

34:26.534 --> 34:30.830
We need a new means of travel,
so we'll acquire horses in Konurlifandi.

34:31.371 --> 34:32.873
From the Valkyries?

34:32.998 --> 34:36.085
We'd be lucky to leave with our lives,
let alone horses.

34:36.210 --> 34:37.503
They'll never help us.

34:37.920 --> 34:40.755
They won't, but Sif will.

34:40.882 --> 34:43.926
So, it's Sif that lures you there.

34:45.928 --> 34:47.013
No, Loki.

34:47.304 --> 34:50.141
I'm just attempting to get us home.
That's all.

34:53.018 --> 34:55.980
Hear that? We're heading to
the Valkyrie training camp.

34:57.356 --> 35:00.610
And passing from
one frigid world to another.

35:01.152 --> 35:07.533
Fandral, just how many of their
maiden warriors have you angered?

35:08.326 --> 35:11.537
Let's just say
I bear an unsettling resemblance

35:11.621 --> 35:14.123
to their archery targets.

35:34.936 --> 35:36.437
We have intruders!

36:04.131 --> 36:06.175
They have the scent. Let's go!

36:25.319 --> 36:26.571
Get down.

36:29.824 --> 36:30.908
Look there.

36:32.660 --> 36:35.913
Sentries. We must find
another means of crossing.

36:36.164 --> 36:40.585
You remember the realm charts as well as I.
This is the only northern route.

36:41.335 --> 36:44.630
We've other trouble. There.

36:50.011 --> 36:51.804
Brother, they sleep.

36:52.013 --> 36:53.723
We can just steal past.

36:54.682 --> 36:55.683
Let's go.

37:27.715 --> 37:29.258
Intruders!

37:30.885 --> 37:33.304
Stop the intruders!

37:38.392 --> 37:39.393
Run!

37:47.109 --> 37:48.361
Loki!

37:52.490 --> 37:53.783
Stay back!

37:56.744 --> 38:00.623
We are Odin's sons,
heirs to the throne of Asgard.

38:01.082 --> 38:02.792
We mean you no harm.

38:03.251 --> 38:05.044
Just let us pass.

38:09.131 --> 38:10.466
Go, go, go!

38:12.301 --> 38:13.845
They come again!

38:15.012 --> 38:16.764
I said stay back!

38:31.654 --> 38:32.697
No!

38:52.800 --> 38:56.387
I did not mean for that to happen.

38:58.431 --> 39:02.101
I know, Brother, but we must go.

39:09.525 --> 39:11.277
Inform the king at once.

39:28.169 --> 39:29.337
Thor.

39:29.462 --> 39:30.505
Say nothing, Loki.

39:31.255 --> 39:35.468
It was not your fault.
Those beasts attacked us.

39:36.093 --> 39:37.970
We were the trespassers, Loki!

39:38.346 --> 39:42.725
They were in the right, and now,
two Frost Giants have died by my hand!

39:54.278 --> 39:55.738
What is your report?

39:56.113 --> 39:59.700
Your Majesty, Elderstahl has been found.

40:00.785 --> 40:01.994
By whom?

40:02.328 --> 40:03.913
The sons of Odin,

40:04.038 --> 40:07.208
and they killed two sentries
escaping to the North.

40:09.377 --> 40:10.670
Father?

40:14.465 --> 40:19.512
Prepare my army.
We march on Asgard this day.

40:43.244 --> 40:45.663
He should not be going in alone.

40:45.746 --> 40:47.456
No man should go in there alone.

40:47.707 --> 40:49.125
No man should go in there at all!

41:18.988 --> 41:20.072
Sif.

41:23.534 --> 41:24.994
No! Wait!

41:25.286 --> 41:27.079
What madness brings you here?

41:27.413 --> 41:29.874
I need you.

41:32.877 --> 41:33.878
You what?

41:34.754 --> 41:38.090
I need you to secure five horses for me.

41:41.844 --> 41:44.096
I've no time for your hostility, Sif.

41:45.139 --> 41:46.557
I just require your help.

41:47.433 --> 41:50.353
No. I came here to get away from you.

41:50.728 --> 41:52.605
Now leave before you're discovered.

41:52.688 --> 41:55.650
Listen to me. I've just
come from Jötunheim.

41:55.733 --> 41:58.611
Terrible things have happened.
I must get home.

41:59.070 --> 42:01.030
Why would you go to Jötunheim?

42:02.156 --> 42:03.866
To find this.

42:08.246 --> 42:10.081
The Sword of Surtur.

42:13.668 --> 42:15.795
Now, please, will you help me?

42:19.340 --> 42:21.467
On your knees, male!

42:24.679 --> 42:26.681
Or die where you stand.

42:39.694 --> 42:41.571
There is a chill in the air.

42:43.489 --> 42:45.032
A familiar one.

42:46.367 --> 42:48.661
I'll prepare your chariot, my lord.

43:39.045 --> 43:41.881
Geirmarr, I seek an audience
with your father.

43:42.173 --> 43:43.883
You may speak to me.

43:44.342 --> 43:47.637
Then I will state it
simply for your benefit.

43:48.012 --> 43:50.932
You violate our peace accord
by your presence here.

43:51.265 --> 43:55.895
We no longer have an accord.
Thor made positive of that.

43:57.188 --> 44:00.274
King Thrym, was our truce so tenuous

44:00.399 --> 44:03.569
that it could be broken
by a youth's careless trespass?

44:03.694 --> 44:05.404
Careless trespass?

44:06.697 --> 44:09.951
He took up Elderstahl
and slew two Northern sentries!

44:10.076 --> 44:11.076
He what?

44:20.878 --> 44:23.798
Odin, you knew not of this?

44:24.632 --> 44:25.632
No.

44:27.260 --> 44:29.220
I'm afraid it changes nothing.

44:29.762 --> 44:34.100
By his actions,
Thor has declared war on Jötunheim.

44:39.522 --> 44:43.568
Your Eminence, what do you seek
in return for averting this war?

44:53.953 --> 44:57.456
All Father, the Frost Giants
continue gathering in the valley.

44:57.665 --> 44:59.584
They await the meeting of their terms.

44:59.667 --> 45:00.793
Which are?

45:01.210 --> 45:04.630
I have until sunrise
to turn over the Sword of Surtur.

45:05.798 --> 45:07.008
He found it?

45:07.258 --> 45:11.637
Yes, and it was used to kill
two Frost sentries in the North.

45:12.388 --> 45:15.850
Sire, we must find them
before the Jtuns do.

45:15.933 --> 45:18.311
With your permission,
I will accompany the Einherjar

45:18.394 --> 45:20.438
to escort them home.

45:20.813 --> 45:23.441
How would you know where to look?
They could be anywhere.

45:25.318 --> 45:27.612
The slayings took place in the North,

45:27.695 --> 45:31.073
where the only sentries would be
posted here at this bridge.

45:31.199 --> 45:35.244
If they crossed over, the route to Asgard
would take them through Svartalfheim.

45:36.287 --> 45:38.164
You would be willing to go back there?

45:38.539 --> 45:40.875
To save your sons, yes.

45:42.126 --> 45:46.005
Your selfless actions
will not go unrewarded, Algrim.

45:46.506 --> 45:47.798
Thank you.

46:08.903 --> 46:11.489
Hear me well, Odin's son.

46:11.572 --> 46:15.368
Asgard has made a grave error
in sending you here.

46:15.618 --> 46:19.455
The error is yours, Brunhilde,
for I did not come alone.

46:22.375 --> 46:24.252
You might as well have.

46:29.465 --> 46:33.427
Hildie, my love,
why don't we end this silliness...

46:33.553 --> 46:35.346
Silence, male!

46:35.429 --> 46:39.350
You will all suffer the same fate
as Odin's last spy.

46:45.106 --> 46:48.860
Do you honestly believe
the prince of Asgard is here to spy?

46:53.948 --> 46:57.034
What I believe is that you have come
to exert your dominance

46:57.160 --> 46:59.787
over the female who fled your embrace.

47:00.079 --> 47:02.874
I came for horses. That's all.

47:02.957 --> 47:05.793
Please release us.
We must return to Asgard.

47:06.002 --> 47:08.838
You mean, escape to Asgard.

47:09.297 --> 47:10.840
I know of your thievery.

47:11.132 --> 47:13.634
How you wish to deliver
the fire sword to Odin

47:13.759 --> 47:17.597
so that he can further subjugate those
who might rise against him.

47:17.680 --> 47:21.225
I am all that keeps that weapon
from falling into the wrong hands!

47:21.517 --> 47:24.395
Who are you to judge a hand's worthiness?

47:25.229 --> 47:28.483
Perhaps its rightful place is in mine.

47:32.570 --> 47:34.572
Attention, wenches!

47:34.864 --> 47:37.450
You will release your prisoners now.

47:51.255 --> 47:56.260
Loki, your brother currently enjoys
his final breaths of life

47:56.844 --> 47:59.472
unless you sheath that weapon.

48:00.515 --> 48:04.352
Loki, do it.
The fire sword must not be used again.

48:06.771 --> 48:08.314
Hand it to me.

48:22.745 --> 48:24.455
Prepare them for execution.

48:24.539 --> 48:25.540
No!

48:25.873 --> 48:29.126
Hold your tongue, Sif,
or you will join them.

48:30.336 --> 48:32.213
What manner of witchery is this?

48:32.797 --> 48:33.923
Frost Giants!

48:38.928 --> 48:41.639
Slay them all and recover the sword!

49:05.955 --> 49:07.665
Hello? Anyone?

49:07.790 --> 49:10.209
Someone get us down!

49:23.181 --> 49:24.181
Hey!

49:56.464 --> 50:00.009
Murderer. Now you die!

50:30.623 --> 50:33.084
Now, quickly, help me get these fangs.

50:57.817 --> 50:59.485
Give them no quarter, lads!

50:59.902 --> 51:01.028
Stop.

51:02.405 --> 51:03.405
But the giants!

51:03.739 --> 51:07.618
It's just like men to assume
we need their protection.

51:07.702 --> 51:08.953
Take this and go.

51:10.079 --> 51:13.875
Sif, provide them with horses
and escort them back to Asgard.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.334
Yes, my lady.

51:15.543 --> 51:16.836
And, Sif,

51:17.753 --> 51:21.048
only return to us when you are truly ready.

51:47.867 --> 51:50.411
Why does nothing grow in this place?

51:50.536 --> 51:53.623
It was a final gift from King Thrym.

51:53.956 --> 51:57.293
But I thought your war with the
Frost Giants ended in Jötunheim.

51:57.460 --> 52:01.714
The war ended there, but
the killing did not.

52:02.256 --> 52:05.301
They set glaciers in
motion across the land,

52:05.551 --> 52:08.679
grinding away any hope
that life might ever return here.

52:09.222 --> 52:14.811
Counselor, I realize this is difficult,
but we've been charged with a mission.

52:17.104 --> 52:19.398
Of course. Forgive me.

52:20.399 --> 52:23.778
The children cannot cross this dead world
without water,

52:23.903 --> 52:26.113
and the only source of it lies just ahead.

52:26.280 --> 52:29.784
If they're here, that's
where we'll find them.

52:45.466 --> 52:47.051
Search the area.

52:56.769 --> 52:59.188
Ander, you're slipping.

53:00.481 --> 53:03.943
Your Highness, rest assured.
It won't happen again.

53:04.402 --> 53:08.406
And to think the four of us didn't qualify
to train with the Einherjar.

53:10.825 --> 53:13.369
Thor, Loki, it's good to see you.

53:13.661 --> 53:17.456
Algrim, never have I
seen a friendlier face.

53:17.540 --> 53:19.292
How did you know to come for us here?

53:19.500 --> 53:21.502
From the Frost Giants.

53:21.627 --> 53:24.839
They have amassed in Asgard
and threaten war.

53:25.256 --> 53:28.384
They... You mean, because of me.

53:28.885 --> 53:32.471
It was an accident, Algrim.
There was no malice intended.

53:32.889 --> 53:36.267
Malice or not, they now demand the sword
as recompense.

53:40.855 --> 53:45.735
No, this weapon is a seeker of death!
We cannot just hand it over!

53:46.152 --> 53:49.947
Your father agrees with you.
That's why he sent us.

53:50.031 --> 53:54.076
Thor, you've carried
this burden long enough.

53:54.202 --> 53:55.953
Allow me to take it from you.

53:56.329 --> 53:59.624
Gladly. It is pure evil.

54:08.049 --> 54:11.552
No. It is the Frost Giants who are evil.

54:12.220 --> 54:17.141
The pain, the persecution, the enslavement.

54:17.266 --> 54:20.895
The eternal suffering
they caused my people.

54:21.020 --> 54:23.481
There was no end to their cruelty.

54:24.440 --> 54:25.440
Algrim?

54:25.525 --> 54:29.403
And though this weapon
has caused you much grief,

54:29.529 --> 54:32.949
there was a time when
it offered great hope.

54:33.074 --> 54:35.034
A promise of freedom.

54:35.326 --> 54:39.330
This place haunts you, Algrim. We must go.

54:39.580 --> 54:43.626
Did Odin ever tell you that
we came to him first?

54:43.751 --> 54:48.005
That we asked for help
in our war against the Frost Giants?

54:48.089 --> 54:49.674
But he refused!

54:49.924 --> 54:55.096
We were forced to turn to Surtur and
this sword for our very survival.

54:55.680 --> 55:00.101
Only then did your father join the war.
Against us!

55:02.061 --> 55:06.274
He struck Surtur down
and sealed the fate of my people!

55:06.524 --> 55:07.524
Algrim!

55:07.608 --> 55:10.736
Now I understand why I was spared.

55:11.612 --> 55:15.658
To avenge the dark elves.
To deliver judgment!

55:19.287 --> 55:20.288
No!

55:52.403 --> 55:57.950
If you return home,
I'll bury you in the ashes of Asgard!

56:08.836 --> 56:10.296
What do we do?

56:18.638 --> 56:22.558
We track down the horses
and then find a way to stop him.

56:47.792 --> 56:49.502
Odin's dark elf.

56:50.795 --> 56:52.421
He carries Elderstahl.

56:53.422 --> 56:55.591
We should seize it now
before he reaches safety.

56:55.925 --> 56:58.845
I gave Odin until sunrise.

56:59.095 --> 57:00.513
We will wait.

57:10.481 --> 57:11.649
Algrim.

57:16.904 --> 57:18.865
Here, Sire!

57:29.917 --> 57:30.917
Why?

57:32.461 --> 57:35.381
You more than anyone should know why.

57:35.590 --> 57:39.302
You still hold me responsible
for the fate of your race?

57:48.019 --> 57:50.563
You could have defeated the Frost Giants!

57:50.771 --> 57:54.609
No. That war could not have been won,

57:54.817 --> 57:58.488
even if I had sacrificed
every life in Asgard.

57:59.113 --> 58:00.198
You lie!

58:16.172 --> 58:18.090
We found a way to win!

58:19.300 --> 58:23.930
Surtur. He was no savior. He was a demon!

58:24.263 --> 58:28.601
He aligned himself
with you only to conquer Jötunheim.

58:28.726 --> 58:31.270
But he would not have stopped there.

58:49.622 --> 58:54.085
By bringing him into your fight,
you risked all the nine realms.

58:54.377 --> 58:57.421
Easy to say when your people still live!

59:20.528 --> 59:24.699
The sun rises, Father,
and Odin still possesses Elderstahl.

59:31.539 --> 59:32.707
Begin.

59:41.090 --> 59:43.050
Return fire!

59:45.469 --> 59:46.929
Release!

01:00:23.508 --> 01:00:24.550
We're too late.

01:00:31.015 --> 01:00:33.893
Sif, Warriors Three,
you must help hold the line.

01:00:34.227 --> 01:00:36.187
Loki and I will save our father.

01:01:05.007 --> 01:01:08.177
Be honest. You can fight, can't you?

01:01:08.261 --> 01:01:10.555
Of course.
Have we never told you of the time...

01:01:10.638 --> 01:01:13.391
Can you fight?

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.644
Yes, if we must.

01:01:34.036 --> 01:01:37.915
Algrim, you will gain nothing from this.

01:01:41.169 --> 01:01:45.631
It's enough that
the war you avoided is upon you,

01:01:45.756 --> 01:01:51.762
and these walls which you protected
at the cost of my people will crumble!

01:02:04.609 --> 01:02:07.820
That sword has taken its last life, Algrim.

01:02:08.112 --> 01:02:12.492
Not as long as
the House of Odin still stands.

01:02:16.621 --> 01:02:17.997
Father.

01:02:19.415 --> 01:02:22.335
Please, please, hold on.

01:03:41.873 --> 01:03:44.500
I cannot forgive this betrayal, Algrim.

01:03:49.839 --> 01:03:53.759
But I cannot forget
the many years you were my friend

01:03:54.051 --> 01:03:55.803
and my family.

01:03:57.138 --> 01:03:59.390
Monster!

01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:21.120
Brother, it's all right.

01:04:21.704 --> 01:04:23.331
It's all right.

01:04:37.428 --> 01:04:39.138
Stay with Father.

01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:07.333
Your Eminence, I am Thor, son of Odin.

01:05:08.793 --> 01:05:10.753
I humbly return Elderstahl to you

01:05:10.837 --> 01:05:14.757
and offer myself as your prisoner
in hopes of ending this conflict.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.850
Kill him.

01:05:26.811 --> 01:05:27.979
Wait.

01:05:28.229 --> 01:05:29.522
Where is Odin?

01:05:29.939 --> 01:05:33.985
Algrim, the dark elf, betrayed us.
My father lies dying.

01:05:34.527 --> 01:05:35.653
And the dark elf?

01:05:36.112 --> 01:05:38.781
He is dead, slain by my brother.

01:05:42.493 --> 01:05:45.872
I warned your father against
giving him sanctuary.

01:05:50.668 --> 01:05:53.171
There are many who seek this weapon,

01:05:53.296 --> 01:05:57.717
for with it, even the weak can
rise up against Jötunheim.

01:05:58.593 --> 01:06:00.553
So I accept your peace offering.

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:04.557
The war ends.

01:06:06.476 --> 01:06:10.521
Father, we are on the cusp of victory.

01:06:11.564 --> 01:06:15.234
Do not underestimate
the might of this kingdom, Geirmarr.

01:06:16.027 --> 01:06:19.489
Besides, we have what we came for.

01:06:22.909 --> 01:06:24.243
And what of my fate?

01:06:27.413 --> 01:06:30.208
Two Jtuns died by your hand.

01:06:34.295 --> 01:06:39.091
But you have saved countless others
by returning this weapon to us.

01:06:42.094 --> 01:06:46.849
Now go. Tend to your father, son of Odin.

01:07:20.049 --> 01:07:21.384
Loki.

01:07:27.223 --> 01:07:29.350
You've been hiding in this temple
long enough.

01:07:31.352 --> 01:07:34.397
I'm not hiding. I like it here.

01:07:36.816 --> 01:07:38.860
I know you lament your actions,

01:07:39.318 --> 01:07:42.446
but you did what you thought was right
to save us.

01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:45.449
No, I sought vengeance.

01:07:47.994 --> 01:07:50.496
Thor, I am convinced that,

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:53.374
in Algrim's place,
I would have acted no differently.

01:07:54.917 --> 01:07:58.421
Who of us knows what we're capable of
when family is threatened?

01:07:59.839 --> 01:08:03.509
Hopefully, we'll never again be
faced with such choices.

01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:07.680
I'm going to see Father. Will you join me?

01:08:08.473 --> 01:08:10.183
I will.

01:08:11.517 --> 01:08:12.643
Later.

01:08:23.196 --> 01:08:25.281
Are you up for a visitor?

01:08:25.363 --> 01:08:27.073
Of course. Come in.

01:08:30.077 --> 01:08:31.245
How is your brother?

01:08:31.662 --> 01:08:32.662
He'll be fine.

01:08:33.372 --> 01:08:34.540
And you?

01:08:35.291 --> 01:08:36.542
I will be fine, as well.

01:08:37.585 --> 01:08:39.670
I imagine much is on your mind.

01:08:40.212 --> 01:08:42.798
Father, I should have listened to you.

01:08:43.841 --> 01:08:46.301
I was just so eager to prove myself.

01:08:46.886 --> 01:08:48.679
And I should have listened to you.

01:08:49.305 --> 01:08:50.305
Why?

01:08:51.057 --> 01:08:54.810
You came to me as a man,
seeking to test your mettle.

01:08:55.728 --> 01:08:57.688
I saw only a boy.

01:08:57.814 --> 01:08:59.064
Because I was.

01:08:59.564 --> 01:09:02.819
Father, due to my heedless actions,
I ignited a war.

01:09:02.902 --> 01:09:08.073
Yes, you did,
and you saw what little it takes.

01:09:08.866 --> 01:09:11.368
But then you also saw the value of peace,

01:09:11.577 --> 01:09:15.540
even when its cost can be so very great.

01:09:16.666 --> 01:09:19.001
Such wisdom took me ages to learn.

01:09:19.836 --> 01:09:24.549
Son, never has the House of Odin
stood on firmer ground

01:09:24.756 --> 01:09:26.175
or been more revered.

01:09:26.843 --> 01:09:28.803
You have done this kingdom proud.

01:09:36.644 --> 01:09:39.939
We hadn't even gotten to Jötunheim
when our troubles began.

01:09:40.064 --> 01:09:42.942
Stopping for a little repast
at an outland pub,

01:09:43.192 --> 01:09:49.448
we found ourselves surrounded by the
most vile beasts of all the nine realms.

01:09:50.448 --> 01:09:51.742
White bears?

01:09:51.826 --> 01:09:53.161
Wolves, love.

01:09:53.327 --> 01:09:58.833
These fiends eat white bears for breakfast,
as do I.

01:09:59.834 --> 01:10:01.210
How many were after you?

01:10:02.044 --> 01:10:03.546
- Seven.
- Ten.

01:10:03.629 --> 01:10:05.006
Thirty-four.

01:10:08.176 --> 01:10:11.679
Lads, have I caught you
filling their ears with lies again?

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:15.183
Well, it was the dead of night after all.

01:10:15.308 --> 01:10:17.560
With nary a torch lit.

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:20.480
Because I'm certain I counted at least 50.

01:10:21.814 --> 01:10:27.695
He's right. Fifty. Fortunately,
I knew the art of disemboweling.

01:10:27.862 --> 01:10:31.741
They attacked with matted fur
and dripping fangs,

01:10:31.824 --> 01:10:34.702
intent on feasting on Asgardian meat!

01:10:34.827 --> 01:10:37.788
So, naturally, they went
after Volstagg first.

01:10:46.464 --> 01:10:49.509
I understand your father
continues to gain his strength.

01:10:49.634 --> 01:10:52.345
He does, with new scars added to old.

01:10:52.637 --> 01:10:54.931
Good. I am happy to hear that.

01:10:56.390 --> 01:11:00.353
And what's this I hear about you being
recruited to train with the new Einherjar?

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.855
As if you didn't have
anything to do with that.

01:11:03.231 --> 01:11:07.235
No, you've proven your worth.
Your acceptance was your doing.

01:11:08.277 --> 01:11:10.696
Although, I am pleased
it's no longer a mere maiden

01:11:10.822 --> 01:11:12.824
that bested me with a barn tool.

01:11:13.115 --> 01:11:14.575
Care for a rematch?

01:11:14.826 --> 01:11:16.202
Absolutely.
