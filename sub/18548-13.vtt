00:25.500 --> 00:26.500
Charlotte?

00:32.180 --> 00:33.180
WHITE NOISE

00:44.140 --> 00:46.539
Charlotte!

00:46.540 --> 00:48.100
Argh!

00:50.180 --> 00:51.660
WHITE NOISE INTENSIFIES

01:27.300 --> 01:28.300
BELL CHIMES

01:31.940 --> 01:33.300
Ow!
Home. Now.

01:41.580 --> 01:43.059
Perhaps they've gone away.

01:43.060 --> 01:45.819
No.
Ever since Joan passed away,

01:45.820 --> 01:48.820
William goes nowhere except
church and work.

01:48.860 --> 01:51.180
Something must be wrong.
He's probably ill.

01:52.540 --> 01:54.300
Well, maybe.

01:54.340 --> 01:57.260
Anyway, I'll call round and I could
bring him some of that soup

01:57.300 --> 01:58.499
that's left over.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.660
VEHICLE APPROACHES

02:01.860 --> 02:02.980
What do you think?

02:03.020 --> 02:05.219
Yes, it suits you -

02:05.220 --> 02:09.019
unreliable, noisy, and good at
getting people into trouble!

02:09.020 --> 02:12.060
Actually, it's not mine.
It's a present.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.420
For Father Brown.

02:13.460 --> 02:16.739
What would Father Brown want
with a deathtrap like that?

02:16.740 --> 02:19.820
Well, you said that your knees
were hurting you.

02:19.860 --> 02:23.060
I thought you should trade
your rusty old bicycle in.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.780
Bucephalus is NOT rusty!

02:25.820 --> 02:29.739
Well, wouldn't you like to keep up
with the fast-paced, modern times?

02:29.740 --> 02:34.020
We can discuss this later.
We have soup to deliver.

02:48.900 --> 02:51.780
Sorry. I'm not expecting visitors.

02:51.820 --> 02:54.740
William, I don't think
you're very well.

02:55.980 --> 02:57.380
But I have just the thing,

02:57.420 --> 02:59.859
so I'll come in and heat it up
for you, shall I?

02:59.860 --> 03:04.779
It's really not necessary.
I overslept, that's all.

03:04.780 --> 03:06.899
Well, I'm not going anywhere

03:06.900 --> 03:10.260
until I know that you're
being properly looked after.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.300
And where is that daughter of yours?

03:13.900 --> 03:15.460
I'm not sure.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.460
Well, when did you last see her?

03:21.300 --> 03:22.500
Last night.

03:25.060 --> 03:26.380
In the woods.

03:30.100 --> 03:33.820
There was a light...
over the wheat field...

03:34.980 --> 03:36.180
A light?

03:36.220 --> 03:38.620
(I think someone's
trying to take her away.)

03:46.980 --> 03:48.260
Aliens?!

03:48.300 --> 03:49.580
He did not say "aliens".

03:49.620 --> 03:52.020
That's a relief, cos I'd send
Goodfellow to patrol

03:52.060 --> 03:54.860
the outer cosmos, but his rocket
boots are at the cobblers.

03:54.900 --> 03:58.140
At least pretend to
take this seriously!

03:58.180 --> 04:02.180
Mr Bayley's a solicitor. He is
a respected member of the community.

04:02.220 --> 04:05.620
What would you have me do?
Call Buck Rogers?

04:05.660 --> 04:07.660
The girl's only been
missing since last night,

04:07.700 --> 04:10.259
and during that time I don't
think we've had a report

04:10.260 --> 04:11.420
of a flying saucer!

04:13.180 --> 04:14.180
Help me!

04:14.220 --> 04:16.380
Miss Bayley? What's happened?

04:17.660 --> 04:19.059
It's trying to get out!

04:19.060 --> 04:21.499
What is?

04:21.500 --> 04:23.299
We need to call for an ambulance.

04:23.300 --> 04:25.140
Now, will you take this seriously?!

04:38.220 --> 04:40.780
Let's do a Galli Mainini
test, please, nurse.

04:40.820 --> 04:41.820
Yes, doctor.

04:46.900 --> 04:51.140
We've sedated her. When she woke,
she was very disorientated.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.459
Did she say what happened?

04:54.460 --> 04:58.100
Something about being held captive.
She wasn't making much sense.

04:58.140 --> 05:00.100
It appears she's had a fall,

05:00.140 --> 05:03.140
but there's no sign of head injury
or internal bleeding.

05:03.180 --> 05:06.340
Don't fret. I'll keep
a very close eye on her.

05:06.380 --> 05:09.379
Get her through this,
and I'll gladly waive my fee.

05:09.380 --> 05:10.660
That won't be necessary.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.220
"Fee"?

05:15.260 --> 05:18.459
Oh, Mr Bayley's helping me
resolve a legal misunderstanding

05:18.460 --> 05:21.500
with a previous employer -
all very tiresome.

05:21.540 --> 05:22.820
If you'll excuse me.

05:26.540 --> 05:28.779
I'm afraid you'll have
to wait outside.

05:28.780 --> 05:32.140
Surely you can make an
exception for her father.

05:32.180 --> 05:34.419
Sorry. Hospital rules.

05:34.420 --> 05:37.660
I'm not letting Charlotte
out of my sight.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.099
I heard what happened. I wanted...

05:39.100 --> 05:40.700
How dare you?!
I just...

05:40.740 --> 05:41.900
Get out!

05:47.140 --> 05:49.060
Excuse me!

05:49.100 --> 05:50.460
Please, wait.

05:52.940 --> 05:54.980
Are you a friend of the family?

05:55.020 --> 05:56.779
I'm their gardener.

05:56.780 --> 05:58.580
Well, used to be.

05:58.620 --> 06:01.420
Have you any idea how Charlotte
got those injuries?

06:01.460 --> 06:02.660
You think I did this?

06:02.700 --> 06:05.019
No! No.

06:05.020 --> 06:08.219
Just make sure Charlotte's
looked after, yeah?

06:08.220 --> 06:09.580
Yes.

06:11.300 --> 06:13.780
Don't suppose he could shed
any light on all this?

06:13.820 --> 06:16.459
No.
Pity.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.780
A fall would explain
the external symptoms,

06:18.820 --> 06:23.259
but the abdominal cramps,
disorientation, tachycardia...

06:23.260 --> 06:26.220
It's like she's ingested
some kind of toxin.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.779
Can you treat her here?

06:27.780 --> 06:29.380
In theory.

06:29.420 --> 06:31.379
We're not
the best-equipped hospital

06:31.380 --> 06:34.460
but I was an army surgeon.
I've made do with less.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.180
The problem is not knowing
what she's taken.

06:37.220 --> 06:39.619
And you think she's pregnant?

06:39.620 --> 06:41.220
The Galli Mainini test.

06:43.140 --> 06:46.379
Abdominal issues, woman her age,
makes sense to check.

06:46.380 --> 06:48.140
The results will be with us in
a few hours.

06:48.180 --> 06:50.580
Until then, we watch and wait.

06:50.620 --> 06:53.179
And pray.

06:53.180 --> 06:57.660
Indeed. Poor girl.
She doesn't deserve this.

06:57.700 --> 07:01.460
Do you know Charlotte, erm,
through Mr Bayley?

07:01.500 --> 07:04.380
No, no. Actually, I treated
her mother, Joan.

07:05.820 --> 07:09.500
Charlotte used to come every day.
She would comfort her, read to her.

07:09.540 --> 07:12.939
She's got a good heart.
I just hope it's a strong one.

07:12.940 --> 07:16.180
I'll do everything I can
to discover what happened.

07:16.220 --> 07:18.180
If you do,
let me know straight away.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.620
Time is of the essence.

07:19.660 --> 07:24.860
Yes. Fear not -
my winged chariot awaits.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.660
Now you just start her up.

07:37.300 --> 07:40.099
I can't believe you're
even considering it!

07:40.100 --> 07:42.980
Here's your book.
And now, thanks to you,

07:43.020 --> 07:46.859
the librarian thinks I'm a
homicidal horticulturalist!

07:46.860 --> 07:50.180
Well, at least they'll never dare
charge you overdue fees.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.340
Did you find out anything
about the gardener?

07:52.380 --> 07:53.980
Yes. His name's Sean Crimp.

07:54.020 --> 07:56.420
The neighbours heard them
arguing a few days ago,

07:56.460 --> 08:00.099
and Mr Crimp was told to leave
the property and never to return.

08:00.100 --> 08:03.259
Do you know what
the argument was about?

08:03.260 --> 08:06.099
The young rogue was probably trying
to lead Charlotte astray,

08:06.100 --> 08:08.060
and William found out.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.420
Well, maybe this was his revenge.

08:11.860 --> 08:13.460
Why take it out on Charlotte?

08:16.940 --> 08:20.579
I think we need to hear Mr Crimp's
side of the story.

08:20.580 --> 08:23.420
I'm sorry, I promised William I'd go
straight back to the hospital.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.860
Well, I'll go with you, Father.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.900
You did say "young rogue",
didn't you?

08:29.940 --> 08:31.300
CHATTER

08:32.980 --> 08:35.499
He is head-over-heels
in love with Charlotte.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.179
Is he?

08:37.179 --> 08:39.539
Well, he didn't even offer
to buy me a drink.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.820
His eyes lit up when
I mentioned her.

08:43.860 --> 08:46.860
After that, I could barely
get a word out of him.

08:46.900 --> 08:51.059
Maybe he kidnapped Charlotte,
and then she escaped.

08:51.060 --> 08:52.340
Why poison her?

08:54.300 --> 08:57.539
And why didn't William Bayley
call the police?

08:57.540 --> 08:58.740
So, what now?

09:00.140 --> 09:02.900
I think we need to
examine his garden.

09:15.340 --> 09:17.459
Anything?

09:17.460 --> 09:20.980
Erm, nothing that fits
Charlotte's symptoms.

09:21.020 --> 09:23.420
Well, what's to say it's a plant?

09:23.460 --> 09:27.100
You can find all manner of things
in people's bathroom cabinets.

09:31.940 --> 09:33.700
Father?

09:33.740 --> 09:34.740
What is it?

09:38.540 --> 09:40.220
I need to go to the hospital.

09:45.300 --> 09:46.700
Ergot is a fungus,

09:46.740 --> 09:49.940
and its effects might explain
the uterine contractions.

09:49.980 --> 09:52.980
You think she was trying
to abort an unwanted pregnancy?

09:53.020 --> 09:56.659
Well, it's possible.
The fungus grows on wheat,

09:56.660 --> 09:58.499
and the last time she was seen,

09:58.500 --> 10:00.540
she was heading towards
the field by her house.

10:02.780 --> 10:05.739
Ergot's used for treating migraines.

10:05.740 --> 10:08.179
Charlotte's mother
suffered from them.

10:08.180 --> 10:12.299
Perhaps she found some around
the house and took it by mistake.

10:12.300 --> 10:16.340
Either way, let's keep this to
ourselves until we've spoken to her.

10:18.420 --> 10:19.540
Doctor...

10:22.260 --> 10:24.260
..will she survive?

10:24.300 --> 10:25.900
Yes.

10:25.940 --> 10:29.940
We'll flush out her system,
give her some calcium chloride.

10:29.980 --> 10:32.419
Her heart rate's
already stabilising.

10:32.420 --> 10:35.819
I've been trying to persuade William
to go home and get some rest.

10:35.820 --> 10:39.580
I'd prefer to stay. I'll telephone
you the moment she wakes.

10:39.620 --> 10:40.900
She couldn't be in better hands.

10:40.940 --> 10:44.820
Dr Ashley's a war hero -
saved more men than penicillin!

10:44.860 --> 10:46.220
Nurse, what have I said?

10:48.100 --> 10:50.260
Prone to exaggeration.

10:50.300 --> 10:53.259
I'll prepare Charlotte's treatment.

10:53.260 --> 10:56.060
He's won medals for it
and everything.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.859
Speaking of the doctor, here.

10:57.860 --> 11:02.660
I asked him to prescribe you this.
It'll help you sleep.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.700
As you're so keen
to get rid of me...

11:06.340 --> 11:07.740
The moment she wakes.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.260
She's all I have left.

11:24.620 --> 11:26.020
Alisha.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.259
What're you doing here?

11:27.260 --> 11:30.020
Can I have sixpence?
They're showing Monsters From Mars

11:30.060 --> 11:31.459
at the village hall.

11:31.460 --> 11:34.140
We can't afford to throw money away
on silly films. Now go home!

11:34.180 --> 11:35.780
Just a minute, young man.

11:35.820 --> 11:40.659
I think I might just
have a sixpence in here...

11:40.660 --> 11:42.859
Thank you!

11:42.860 --> 11:44.339
You didn't need to do that.

11:44.340 --> 11:46.620
Oh, it was entirely my pleasure.

11:46.660 --> 11:48.340
Is that your brother?

11:48.380 --> 11:51.300
Yes. It's just the two of us
since mother passed away.

11:51.340 --> 11:52.820
Not easy on my wages.

11:53.940 --> 11:56.779
We're always here to
help if you need it.

11:56.780 --> 11:59.299
Well, in that case,
would you mind going along

11:59.300 --> 12:02.380
and keeping an eye on Nikhil?
In case he gets scared.

12:02.420 --> 12:04.420
I'd go, but I'm on the late shift.

12:04.460 --> 12:06.620
I was thinking more...
We'd be glad to!

12:08.700 --> 12:11.140
DRAMATIC MUSIC

12:13.820 --> 12:16.580
HEAVY BREATHING

12:29.580 --> 12:31.180
HE SCREAMS

12:47.100 --> 12:49.060
HE PANTS

12:55.220 --> 12:56.220
OWL HOOTS

12:58.260 --> 13:00.460
EERIE ROARING

13:00.500 --> 13:01.780
Who's there?

13:06.020 --> 13:07.780
WHISPERING

13:07.820 --> 13:08.900
Who is it?

13:10.060 --> 13:11.060
Answer me!

13:18.380 --> 13:19.780
Go away...

13:21.220 --> 13:23.020
Leave me alone!

13:23.060 --> 13:25.140
SCREECHING

13:30.180 --> 13:31.580
Police...

13:34.340 --> 13:36.059
It's aliens!

13:36.060 --> 13:37.420
KNOCK AT DOOR

13:39.340 --> 13:40.940
Perhaps he overslept again.

13:42.740 --> 13:44.340
He was exhausted yesterday.

13:54.340 --> 13:55.540
Holy Mother...

13:59.980 --> 14:02.620
Door was locked from
the inside, windows bolted.

14:02.660 --> 14:04.660
No other way into the room.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.700
Looks like natural causes.

14:06.740 --> 14:08.139
Heart attack, probably.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.740
Report from the station, sir.

14:09.780 --> 14:13.380
A telephone operator reported
a 999 call from here last night.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.220
"The gentleman said something
about aliens coming for him,

14:16.260 --> 14:18.500
"then the line went dead."

14:18.540 --> 14:21.140
"Aliens?"
That's what she said, sir.

14:24.260 --> 14:26.420
Did you notice the dilated pupils?

14:29.380 --> 14:31.339
He's right, sir.

14:31.340 --> 14:33.100
Looks like the man's died of fright!

14:33.140 --> 14:36.140
What're you still doing here, Padre?

14:36.180 --> 14:39.619
Er, we thought you might want
us to give a statement.

14:39.620 --> 14:40.820
I don't.

14:40.860 --> 14:45.500
Inspector, may I be the one
to inform Mr Bayley's daughter?

14:45.540 --> 14:48.340
I am a friend of the family.

14:48.380 --> 14:52.579
Be my guest, so long as you take
this nosy parker with you!

14:52.580 --> 14:54.420
Yes. With pleasure.

14:59.540 --> 15:01.979
Beware the Devil's Trumpet.

15:01.980 --> 15:04.580
What does that mean?
Get out!

15:08.900 --> 15:10.260
As soon as you're feeling better,

15:10.300 --> 15:12.540
we can discuss
the funeral arrangements.

15:14.340 --> 15:15.380
Thank you.

15:17.620 --> 15:20.299
I can't even think straight
right now.

15:20.300 --> 15:23.780
That's hardly surprising.
And there is no rush.

15:25.340 --> 15:28.220
Charlotte, what happened to you?

15:29.620 --> 15:31.220
How did you get your injuries?

15:34.100 --> 15:35.460
I...

15:38.220 --> 15:39.340
I can't remember.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.140
Miss Bayley needs rest.

15:44.780 --> 15:46.940
Yes. I'll come back
and see you later.

15:49.020 --> 15:51.900
Father, a word? In private.

15:53.180 --> 15:54.340
Yes. Of course.

15:58.260 --> 16:00.260
I shouldn't be telling you this.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.860
The pregnancy test was positive.

16:06.060 --> 16:09.539
If she took ergot in an attempt
to abort the pregnancy,

16:09.540 --> 16:11.780
it's a criminal offence
and I should report her.

16:13.380 --> 16:14.380
However...

16:16.700 --> 16:18.539
..there's no sign of a miscarriage,

16:18.540 --> 16:22.259
and I'm not willing to cause further
distress to a scared, young woman

16:22.260 --> 16:24.699
who's already lost her father.

16:24.700 --> 16:26.740
Are you?

16:26.780 --> 16:27.860
No.

16:29.900 --> 16:33.300
Perhaps a vow of
silence is in order.

16:34.820 --> 16:37.620
If we don't ask, she won't tell.

16:47.980 --> 16:49.380
We're done here.

16:55.940 --> 16:57.420
"Beware the Devil's Trumpet"!

16:58.660 --> 17:01.180
Have you lost your
marbles, Sergeant?

17:01.220 --> 17:06.260
That plant, sir. Devil's Trumpet
is a nickname for thorn apple.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.660
Poisonous.
Sends you mad, apparently.

17:09.780 --> 17:12.579
You've got hidden depth, Sergeant.

17:12.619 --> 17:15.740
Mad enough to believe you're
being attacked by aliens.

17:17.780 --> 17:20.060
Maybe not "natural causes",
then, sir?

17:29.260 --> 17:31.899
Will you be OK if I go on my break?

17:31.900 --> 17:33.620
I'll pop by as soon as I'm back.

17:45.820 --> 17:49.100
I forgot to ask - is there anyone
you would like me to contact?

17:51.300 --> 17:52.980
Mr Crimp, for example.

17:54.420 --> 17:57.220
He came to see you the other day.
He seemed very concerned.

18:00.140 --> 18:02.100
You must think I'm very wicked.

18:02.140 --> 18:03.979
For falling in love?

18:03.980 --> 18:05.940
Sean's probably still angry at me.

18:08.060 --> 18:09.580
We were supposed to elope.

18:11.700 --> 18:13.060
I changed my mind.

18:14.940 --> 18:16.979
The baby?

18:16.980 --> 18:19.820
Oh, don't blame Dr Ashley.

18:19.860 --> 18:22.499
I made my own deduction.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.739
Sean doesn't even know I'm pregnant.

18:24.740 --> 18:30.140
The argument between your father
and Mr Crimp - was that about you?

18:30.180 --> 18:32.580
Father caught us kissing.

18:34.700 --> 18:36.660
He fired Sean on the spot.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.700
The police think your father
died of a heart attack

18:39.740 --> 18:41.220
but I think he was poisoned.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.059
Poisoned?

18:45.060 --> 18:48.180
Yes. His pupils were very dilated.

18:48.220 --> 18:52.979
There is a plant in your garden
- a thorn apple -

18:52.980 --> 18:55.780
which contains atropine, and...

18:58.820 --> 19:01.660
Well, the symptoms fit.

19:07.340 --> 19:09.300
Could Sean have...?
No!

19:11.620 --> 19:13.420
No. It must have been someone else.

19:31.180 --> 19:33.499
Not in the mood for company, Father.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.740
Not even Charlotte's?

19:36.220 --> 19:37.419
She's awake?

19:37.420 --> 19:40.820
And asking after you, but she's
afraid you might be angry with her.

19:43.020 --> 19:44.180
Me, angry with HER?

19:45.740 --> 19:49.140
I thought she didn't want
anything more to do with me.

19:49.180 --> 19:52.220
Let's get you some coffee
and we'll go and see her.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.300
Sean Crimp, I'm arresting you

19:56.340 --> 19:58.900
on suspicion of the murder
of William Bayley.

19:58.940 --> 20:00.340
You're not obliged to say anything,

20:00.380 --> 20:03.180
but whatever you say may be
taken down and given in evidence.

20:03.220 --> 20:06.340
Murder?! I haven't done anything!

20:06.380 --> 20:08.019
Right, son, up you get.

20:08.020 --> 20:10.300
Tell Charlotte it's not true!
Come on, this way.

20:14.700 --> 20:17.780
The thorn apple.
Grow it yourself, did you?

20:17.820 --> 20:23.020
No. Neighbours heard you and
Mr Bayley arguing. What about?

20:23.060 --> 20:26.300
No comment.
He fires you. You want revenge.

20:26.340 --> 20:28.019
You poison him.
No!

20:28.020 --> 20:31.020
So you didn't go anywhere
near the Bayleys' house?

20:31.060 --> 20:34.060
Cos we've got witnesses
who saw you leave the village hall

20:34.100 --> 20:36.179
not long before Mr Bayley's death.

20:36.180 --> 20:39.299
We also found a footprint in
the flowerbed outside his study -

20:39.300 --> 20:41.980
matches your shoe size!

20:42.020 --> 20:44.420
My footprints are probably
all over the garden!

20:44.460 --> 20:46.660
But he fired you days ago.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.940
This one... was fresh.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.180
HE SIGHS

20:55.820 --> 20:58.100
All right. I went there.

20:58.140 --> 20:59.259
Why?

20:59.260 --> 21:01.060
HE SIGHS

21:01.100 --> 21:04.139
To convince him to let
me and Charlotte marry.

21:04.140 --> 21:06.939
And I'm guessing he said no.

21:06.940 --> 21:08.860
I never got the chance.

21:10.220 --> 21:12.060
Mr Bayley wouldn't open the door.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.780
KNOCK AT DOOR

21:14.820 --> 21:16.059
Who's there?!

21:16.060 --> 21:20.740
'He started yelling,
like I was this wild beast.'

21:21.940 --> 21:23.899
Who is it?!

21:23.900 --> 21:25.140
Answer me!

21:27.740 --> 21:30.219
I gave up and I went home.

21:30.220 --> 21:32.340
Admit it - you poisoned him!

21:32.380 --> 21:33.580
KNOCK AT DOOR

21:33.620 --> 21:35.019
Not now!

21:35.020 --> 21:37.620
With respect, sir,
you really need to see this.

21:42.980 --> 21:44.740
HE SIGHS

21:44.780 --> 21:45.940
Just up here, sir.

21:47.460 --> 21:49.860
Don't you ever give up?
Erm...

21:51.060 --> 21:54.100
Hoping to have a chat with you
about Sean Crimp.

21:54.140 --> 21:55.340
I was afraid you'd say that.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.940
Charlotte Bayley wants to know
if you're going to charge him.

21:57.980 --> 21:59.739
So it's true, those two are an item?

21:59.740 --> 22:02.019
Yes, well, if it was, erm,

22:02.020 --> 22:06.100
Sean would hardly choose
a murder weapon from the garden.

22:06.140 --> 22:08.500
That would make him
the most likely suspect.

22:08.540 --> 22:11.379
You're suggesting someone
PLANTED the evidence?

22:11.380 --> 22:12.780
Good one, Inspector.

22:12.820 --> 22:15.820
You give the average criminal
too much credit, Padre.

22:15.860 --> 22:18.619
In my experience,
they're mostly half-wits.

22:18.620 --> 22:22.140
Right, here we are, sir.

22:23.740 --> 22:25.380
What am I looking at?

22:25.420 --> 22:26.820
Right there, sir.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.460
Flaming Nora.

22:38.220 --> 22:39.580
It's very kind of you.

22:39.620 --> 22:41.499
I've been tinkering with my
dumplings,

22:41.500 --> 22:44.260
and I would very much value
your opinion...

22:44.300 --> 22:48.620
I see you've eaten already...
Hello again. Hello.

22:48.660 --> 22:49.740
Well, this will keep.

22:49.780 --> 22:52.780
Cooking helps take my mind
off things.

22:52.820 --> 22:54.820
It's so horrible what
happened to Charlotte.

22:54.860 --> 22:56.540
I didn't know you knew her.

22:56.580 --> 22:58.139
We're old friends.

22:58.140 --> 23:00.659
My mother worked as
a cleaner for Mr Bayley.

23:00.660 --> 23:02.740
Sometimes I'd tag along.

23:02.780 --> 23:03.860
But then mother got sick,

23:03.900 --> 23:07.780
and Mr Bayley dismissed her
without a second thought.

23:11.260 --> 23:13.340
Oh, thank you.

23:16.900 --> 23:19.780
Did you hear about
the symbol in the field?

23:19.820 --> 23:22.660
What symbol?
Burnt into the ground,

23:22.700 --> 23:25.099
but no-one seems to know
what it means.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.659
I bet it was the aliens!
What does it look like?

23:27.660 --> 23:31.380
Nikhil, aliens don't exist anywhere
but in your foolish imagination.

23:31.420 --> 23:33.620
But... If you've finished,
go do your homework.

23:33.660 --> 23:35.260
HE SIGHS

23:36.500 --> 23:40.099
Sorry. He's a good boy, but...

23:40.100 --> 23:43.100
Nikhil believes there's
alien technology out there,

23:43.140 --> 23:46.220
which could help bring
our mother back.

23:46.260 --> 23:49.140
Oh. And your father?

23:51.740 --> 23:53.740
He returned to India
a few years ago.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.580
If it ever gets too much for you,

23:58.620 --> 24:02.460
you know there's always a warm
welcome for you both at St Mary's.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.939
We're not Catholic, I'm afraid.

24:04.940 --> 24:07.340
That doesn't mean you can't
join me for a cup of tea

24:07.380 --> 24:09.780
or a slice of cake, now, does it?

24:25.260 --> 24:26.540
They'll see.

24:28.940 --> 24:30.980
Good morning.
Morning.

24:44.220 --> 24:45.940
More sightings of the symbol, sir.

24:45.980 --> 24:48.580
Mrs Bagshot says someone's
even painted it on her outhouse.

24:48.620 --> 24:52.219
Then find out who's doing it
and lock them up!

24:52.220 --> 24:53.860
I'm off.
Yeah.

24:55.500 --> 24:58.100
The thing is, sir,
people are getting nervous.

24:58.140 --> 25:01.339
You know, they're saying
it's from outer space.

25:01.340 --> 25:03.100
I thought, seeing as
it's a celestial matter,

25:03.140 --> 25:05.339
we should speak to
Father Brown, and maybe...

25:05.340 --> 25:07.379
Catch the vandal!

25:07.380 --> 25:10.500
And don't mention aliens again,
unless you personally see

25:10.540 --> 25:13.780
little green men walking along
Kembleford High Street!

25:15.020 --> 25:16.340
Yes, sir.

25:20.940 --> 25:23.380
FIREWORKS

25:37.580 --> 25:39.180
Alisha! Come look!

25:48.020 --> 25:53.140
Yes, all right. If you could just
please speak one at a time!

25:53.180 --> 25:54.260
Please!

25:56.180 --> 25:57.340
Your attention, please!

26:00.260 --> 26:03.740
I can assure you there is
nothing to worry about.

26:05.660 --> 26:10.220
But, to allay your concerns,
I will dispatch all the men

26:10.260 --> 26:16.140
at my disposal to investigate
the flying... thingamajig.

26:16.180 --> 26:21.460
In the meantime, for your own
safety, please return home.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.940
Immediately!
Come along, ladies and gentlemen.

26:33.020 --> 26:35.620
Stay here. And keep calm.

26:38.100 --> 26:41.420
And if I'm not back by midnight,
call the army!

26:46.020 --> 26:48.700
Well...

26:48.740 --> 26:51.860
whatever it is, it's gone.

26:53.460 --> 26:56.619
Oh... I'm really sorry
I woke you, Father.

26:56.620 --> 27:00.100
I only wanted to make sure that
you were all right.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.059
That's very kind of you.
DOOR OPENS

27:02.060 --> 27:04.340
Only me!
Saw your light on.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.900
Oh, I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

27:09.900 --> 27:11.580
I beg your pardon?!

27:11.620 --> 27:14.859
I just wanted to make sure
you were OK, Father.

27:14.860 --> 27:16.940
Cos you don't think it
really was a...?

27:19.300 --> 27:21.459
Do you?

27:21.460 --> 27:22.780
Of course not!

27:22.820 --> 27:25.620
The whole thing was
probably just a silly hoax.

27:25.660 --> 27:29.660
Yes, or maybe it was some sort
of rare weather phenomenon.

27:29.700 --> 27:31.100
KNOCK AT DOOR

27:36.820 --> 27:39.820
Inspector. Cocoa?

27:39.860 --> 27:42.860
No, thank you. Here on business.

27:42.900 --> 27:46.500
We've found no sign of
the spaceship, or whatever it was,

27:46.540 --> 27:47.700
and I wondered if...

27:49.980 --> 27:53.620
Well...
So now you want Father Brown's help?

27:54.860 --> 27:58.900
I'll happily listen to any
hypotheses that you have to offer.

27:58.940 --> 28:02.620
After all, visitations from
the heavens are your department.

28:02.660 --> 28:05.419
Oh, I'm certain it wasn't
"from the heavens".

28:05.420 --> 28:07.220
What was it, then?

28:07.260 --> 28:10.180
Cos I've had every copper for
miles out looking for it.

28:11.340 --> 28:12.420
A distraction.

28:15.980 --> 28:17.539
Typical.

28:17.540 --> 28:18.780
Sergeant! Wake up!

28:20.380 --> 28:21.380
Goodfellow!

28:23.900 --> 28:24.940
Goodfellow?

28:31.420 --> 28:34.460
You! I should write you up!
Asleep on the job!

28:34.500 --> 28:37.100
Keys!
What?

28:37.140 --> 28:38.420
Where's my keys?

29:01.500 --> 29:03.260
SHE CLEARS THROAT

29:05.340 --> 29:07.980
I went to see it.
I recognised it straight away.

29:10.820 --> 29:11.900
It's a warning.

29:13.700 --> 29:16.700
Who from?
The Intergalactic Alliance.

29:16.740 --> 29:20.419
Different planets working together
to protect the galaxy.

29:20.420 --> 29:22.619
It means there's going
to be an invasion!

29:22.620 --> 29:26.020
What, the Intergalactic Alliance
are about to invade?

29:26.060 --> 29:28.059
No, the Droxidians are.

29:28.060 --> 29:30.179
I am completely lost.

29:30.180 --> 29:32.299
The Droxidians are crossing
the galaxy

29:32.300 --> 29:35.819
destroying everything in their path.
In this story,

29:35.820 --> 29:40.660
the humans find the symbol and arm
themselves, ready to defend Earth.

29:40.700 --> 29:42.059
We need to do the same!

29:42.060 --> 29:44.179
That's why I wanted
everyone to see it.

29:44.180 --> 29:46.180
Why didn't you tell the police?

29:46.220 --> 29:49.620
I tried. Inspector Mallory
called me a "guttersnipe".

29:51.340 --> 29:54.100
I hesitate to ask this,
but do we win,

29:54.140 --> 29:55.459
in the story?

29:55.460 --> 29:56.700
I don't know.

29:56.740 --> 29:58.220
What do you mean, you don't know?!

29:58.260 --> 30:02.020
My sister confiscated the latest
edition before I could finish it.

30:03.580 --> 30:06.140
I think we know what we saw in
the sky last night.

30:08.780 --> 30:09.940
Nikhil? You up there?

30:13.940 --> 30:15.020
Something wrong?

30:16.980 --> 30:21.100
I'm presuming Charlotte
asked you for your help.

30:22.540 --> 30:24.740
Excuse me?
To get Sean out of jail.

30:26.020 --> 30:30.020
You needed everybody to be looking
in the opposite direction,

30:30.060 --> 30:32.979
and you certainly got OUR attention.

30:32.980 --> 30:35.819
You knew that rumours
of alien activity

30:35.820 --> 30:38.179
were spreading around Kembleford.

30:38.180 --> 30:41.099
So, using the instructions from
Nikhil's comic book,

30:41.100 --> 30:43.980
you created your very own spaceship.

30:44.020 --> 30:47.179
A few fireworks to make sure
everyone noticed, and you had

30:47.180 --> 30:50.540
the panic and disorder you needed
to sneak Sean out of the cell.

30:52.020 --> 30:55.420
All that stood in your way
was poor Sergeant Goodfellow.

30:55.460 --> 30:56.899
You are mistaken, Father.

30:56.900 --> 30:59.659
Perhaps we should call
Inspector Mallory.

30:59.660 --> 31:02.380
Breaking a suspect out of custody,
causing mass panic!

31:02.420 --> 31:05.860
Wait!
All I did was make the lantern.

31:05.900 --> 31:07.980
It was Charlotte who broke Sean out.

31:09.420 --> 31:10.620
Can I help you, Miss?

31:12.300 --> 31:14.700
Oh, let me help you with that.

31:19.860 --> 31:23.340
Did you...? Did you...?

31:23.380 --> 31:26.579
But Charlotte wouldn't have been
able to leave the ward

31:26.580 --> 31:27.900
without your help.

31:29.580 --> 31:34.659
And I have no doubt you supplied the
sedative stolen from the hospital...

31:34.660 --> 31:36.220
Sorry!

31:36.260 --> 31:40.139
..and as a nurse, you must
have known how dangerous that was.

31:40.140 --> 31:41.940
'She begged me to help her.'

31:41.980 --> 31:44.780
She was terrified Sean would
hang for killing her father.

31:44.820 --> 31:47.420
Did Charlotte say
where Sean had gone?

31:47.460 --> 31:49.140
No.

31:49.180 --> 31:52.059
Just that he was going to lie low
until things calmed down,

31:52.060 --> 31:53.739
then she'd join him.

31:53.740 --> 31:55.379
We need to talk to Charlotte.

31:55.380 --> 31:59.180
Sean needs to give himself up
before things get any worse.

31:59.220 --> 32:03.460
Well, if we're in a rush, I know an
excellent means of transportation.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.179
You take the scooter.

32:05.180 --> 32:06.540
My bike's just outside.

32:08.180 --> 32:09.740
And what about me?

32:12.700 --> 32:16.460
No! No, no, no! Absolutely not!

32:21.380 --> 32:26.299
See? I told you it'd be
over in a flash.

32:26.300 --> 32:28.460
That has been the longest
journey of my life.

32:29.700 --> 32:31.100
Is Charlotte with you?

32:31.140 --> 32:32.459
Isn't she here?

32:32.460 --> 32:34.540
Apparently she's discharged herself!

32:34.580 --> 32:36.380
She really should be
under observation.

32:36.420 --> 32:39.340
Well, don't worry.
We'll find her

32:44.740 --> 32:48.060
What on earth do you think
you're doing?

32:48.100 --> 32:52.420
Ask around. See if anyone knows
where she's gone.

33:00.780 --> 33:01.860
He'll kill himself.

33:10.540 --> 33:12.100
It's time to embrace the future.

33:16.420 --> 33:17.820
Oh!

33:21.300 --> 33:22.980
Oh, I can't look!

33:27.700 --> 33:29.220
Ah!

33:40.940 --> 33:43.300
I thought you I'd find you here.

33:43.340 --> 33:46.619
Please, let us go before
the police find us.

33:46.620 --> 33:49.940
Oh, the police will catch up
with you eventually. Stay.

33:52.300 --> 33:55.819
And let me prove you did
not kill Mr Bayley.

33:55.820 --> 33:57.940
How?
By telling the truth.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.499
The night your father died -

34:01.500 --> 34:04.620
was that the night you were
planning to go away together?

34:04.660 --> 34:07.780
Yes. I slipped some of my mother's
sleeping medicine into

34:07.820 --> 34:13.380
father's night-cap, waited until
he'd gone to bed, and then left.

34:13.420 --> 34:14.900
Sean!

34:18.780 --> 34:20.179
Charlotte!

34:20.219 --> 34:22.020
He must've followed me.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.420
We've got to go.

34:23.460 --> 34:25.418
I can't leave him.

34:25.420 --> 34:27.500
Please, let's just go.

34:27.540 --> 34:29.980
Go back to your place - I'll come
as soon as I can get away.

34:30.020 --> 34:32.139
Forget about him!
He's my father!

34:37.900 --> 34:39.100
Your injuries.

34:42.060 --> 34:43.219
Was that your father?

34:46.219 --> 34:47.219
It was the medicine.

34:48.659 --> 34:50.460
He didn't know what he was doing!

34:50.500 --> 34:51.860
Don't defend him.

34:53.699 --> 34:55.699
I took Father home.

34:55.699 --> 34:57.700
He was ranting and raving, and...

34:59.140 --> 35:00.780
..when I said I loved Sean...

35:02.860 --> 35:04.060
..he started hitting me.

35:06.380 --> 35:09.940
He wouldn't stop,
so I told him about my baby.

35:09.980 --> 35:11.580
Then what did he do?

35:13.220 --> 35:18.700
He went really quiet, and then said
he'd make me something to eat.

35:18.740 --> 35:20.659
When he walked into my room
with a sandwich,

35:20.660 --> 35:24.340
I thought everything was
going to be all right...

35:24.380 --> 35:29.260
but when he left,
he locked the door behind him.

35:31.100 --> 35:34.620
I knocked and shouted for him
to let me out, but he wouldn't come.

35:36.100 --> 35:41.259
Eventually, I just gave up
and fell asleep.

35:41.260 --> 35:45.700
So, when Mrs McCarthy and I came
the following morning...

35:48.900 --> 35:50.579
..you were still upstairs?

35:50.580 --> 35:56.460
I had this pain in my stomach.
I was scared I was losing the baby.

35:57.980 --> 35:59.300
I knew I had to get help.

36:01.980 --> 36:06.699
I couldn't open the door,
so I climbed out of the window.

36:06.700 --> 36:08.139
That's when I fell.

36:08.140 --> 36:09.940
I think he fed you ergot.

36:11.340 --> 36:12.340
He poisoned her?

36:12.341 --> 36:15.500
Well, I don't think
he wanted to poison CHARLOTTE.

36:18.540 --> 36:19.580
It was the baby.

36:22.700 --> 36:25.900
Who else had access
to the thorn-apple?

36:25.940 --> 36:30.819
I mean, anyone could've got in,
but not many would recognise it,

36:30.820 --> 36:33.899
let alone know what atropine
could do to someone.

36:33.900 --> 36:37.380
There were always clients
coming and going,

36:37.420 --> 36:40.380
though I don't recall
any plant experts.

36:41.620 --> 36:44.300
Maybe it was another sort of expert.

36:44.340 --> 36:46.380
Where did your father
keep his files?

36:57.140 --> 37:00.260
Have you found her?
Yes. And she filled in some blanks.

37:01.900 --> 37:04.500
Why did you burn
the symbol into the field?

37:04.540 --> 37:07.060
I told you. To protect Charlotte.

37:07.100 --> 37:09.980
But you could only have done
that on your break,

37:10.020 --> 37:13.020
and Sean Crimp hadn't
been arrested yet.

37:13.060 --> 37:14.460
I...

37:14.500 --> 37:16.459
You must be mistaken.

37:16.460 --> 37:20.260
I think you wanted the police
to chase aliens,

37:20.300 --> 37:21.980
and not the real culprit.

37:24.460 --> 37:25.660
I'm so sorry!

37:26.660 --> 37:28.060
What for?

37:28.100 --> 37:30.756
Please don't tell anyone. If I'm
arrested, who'll look after Nikhil?

37:30.780 --> 37:32.820
Arrested?
What are you talking about?

37:32.860 --> 37:36.819
Mr Bayley's prescription.
I must've got the proportions wrong.

37:36.820 --> 37:39.459
Father Brown said it was
atropine that killed him.

37:39.460 --> 37:41.780
I remember that was
one of the ingredients.

37:41.820 --> 37:44.819
No, no. Don't be ridiculous. Why
would I have prescribed atropine?

37:44.820 --> 37:47.140
It's used for eye examinations.

37:47.180 --> 37:49.020
You must have misread
my handwriting.

37:49.060 --> 37:50.620
Oh, I doubt it.

37:50.660 --> 37:52.059
How else do you explain it?

37:52.060 --> 37:56.539
I think Alicia gave Mr Bayley
exactly what the doctor ordered.

37:56.540 --> 38:01.060
Are you suggesting I deliberately
poisoned my patient? Why?

38:02.220 --> 38:04.220
Because he'd found out your secret.

38:07.300 --> 38:11.340
Your demobilisation certificate,
dated last month.

38:12.580 --> 38:15.419
Where did you...?
Dr Ashley left the army years ago!

38:15.420 --> 38:17.220
Yes.

38:17.260 --> 38:18.820
But without permission.

38:21.420 --> 38:24.740
Did you ever wonder why such
a talented doctor ended up

38:24.780 --> 38:28.419
in a cottage hospital
in the middle of nowhere?

38:28.420 --> 38:29.420
Because...

38:32.700 --> 38:37.540
Were you really prepared to let her
think that she'd killed a man?

38:40.940 --> 38:42.020
The truth is...

38:44.420 --> 38:45.660
..I deserted.

38:48.980 --> 38:51.540
You told me you'd won medals!

38:51.580 --> 38:52.860
I did.

38:54.860 --> 38:56.660
Every man has his breaking point.

38:58.700 --> 39:00.900
Mine was June 13th, 1944.

39:00.940 --> 39:03.100
I won't bore you with the details.

39:04.780 --> 39:08.420
So... what?
You've been hiding here ever since?

39:08.460 --> 39:10.020
Thanks to Mr Churchill...

39:12.220 --> 39:14.539
..all deserters finally
have an amnesty,

39:14.540 --> 39:18.980
and so you employed Mr Bayley
to prepare the papers.

39:19.020 --> 39:21.820
You killed Mr Bayley to stop him
telling people you're a deserter?!

39:21.860 --> 39:23.819
I...

39:23.820 --> 39:27.659
I killed him to stop
him hurting Charlotte.

39:27.660 --> 39:29.140
I don't understand.

39:29.180 --> 39:30.779
He was a vile bully.

39:30.780 --> 39:34.499
Bayley didn't know if the ergot had
worked, so he tried to blackmail me

39:34.500 --> 39:35.820
into performing an abortion,

39:35.860 --> 39:39.500
threatening to tell the Board
of Governors, my patients, everyone,

39:39.540 --> 39:40.900
about my past if I refused.

39:42.180 --> 39:48.020
So when Alisha asked you to prepare
something to help him sleep,

39:48.060 --> 39:50.340
you took your chance to silence him.

39:50.380 --> 39:54.100
He had already put Charlotte through
agony, and whether I agreed

39:54.140 --> 39:57.420
to the abortion or not, he was
determined to kill her unborn child!

39:57.460 --> 39:59.220
Can't you see he deserved it?

39:59.260 --> 40:01.379
Judgment is God's alone.

40:01.380 --> 40:03.580
God?!

40:03.620 --> 40:07.540
Where was He while I was sawing off
men's limbs in Normandy?

40:09.540 --> 40:13.619
I suppose you'll tell the police.
Well...

40:13.620 --> 40:15.419
I rather hoped YOU would.

40:15.420 --> 40:16.860
And hang? No, thank you.

40:16.900 --> 40:19.939
Well, given
the extenuating circumstances,

40:19.940 --> 40:22.419
it would be a custodial sentence.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.380
Still, I'd prefer to leave.

40:26.460 --> 40:29.020
I've made a new life before.
I can do it again.

40:30.300 --> 40:31.460
And Sean Crimp...

40:33.420 --> 40:35.940
..who may be punished
for your crimes.

40:35.980 --> 40:39.699
I'm sure you can convince
a jury of his innocence.

40:39.700 --> 40:41.539
I'd rather you would.

40:41.540 --> 40:44.500
I'm a coward, Father.
Thought you knew already.

40:45.820 --> 40:47.100
I don't think that.

40:49.700 --> 40:50.820
Stay.

40:53.980 --> 40:55.260
Do the right thing.

41:00.380 --> 41:02.580
I'm sorry I'm not the man
you thought I was.

41:14.100 --> 41:18.779
Are you prepared to go back
to hiding in the shadows,

41:18.780 --> 41:20.459
living in fear and guilt?

41:20.460 --> 41:22.060
The deserter's lot, Father.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.980
What was Dr Ashley
doing on your scooter?

41:33.900 --> 41:35.460
Going on the run.

41:35.500 --> 41:37.900
Oh. Well, I could always
buy you another one.

41:50.540 --> 41:52.140
Well?

41:52.180 --> 41:54.540
Inspector Mallory has decided
not to press charges

41:54.580 --> 41:57.780
about your unlawful
escape from custody.

41:57.820 --> 42:00.860
Or assaulting a police officer.

42:00.900 --> 42:02.579
How did you manage that?

42:02.580 --> 42:07.140
Well, Alisha bore witness
to Dr Ashley's confession,

42:07.180 --> 42:11.620
so Inspector Mallory, knowing
the real culprit was still at large,

42:11.660 --> 42:14.979
is happy to brush
everything under the carpet.

42:14.980 --> 42:16.940
Do you think they'll
find the doctor?

42:16.980 --> 42:19.820
Dr Ashley managed to stay under
the radar for the best part

42:19.860 --> 42:22.939
of a decade,
so I wouldn't be too optimistic.

42:22.940 --> 42:24.820
So he'll just get away with it,
then?

42:24.860 --> 42:26.260
Well, I wouldn't say that.

42:28.740 --> 42:30.940
Constantly looking over
his shoulder,

42:30.980 --> 42:32.940
fearful of every knock on the door.

42:36.780 --> 42:41.020
Running away was his crime
AND his punishment.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.540
Thank you, Father.

42:44.580 --> 42:46.180
For everything.

42:47.220 --> 42:53.860
I was wondering if we could ask you
just one last favour.

42:57.420 --> 42:59.379
It would be a pleasure.

42:59.380 --> 43:00.980
But wedding plans will have to wait.

43:01.020 --> 43:03.420
What you need is a good long rest,

43:03.460 --> 43:06.979
and I'll come by this evening
with some dinner.

43:06.980 --> 43:10.340
I think I might...
I might do a curry,

43:10.380 --> 43:14.300
if I can get Alisha to lend
me some of her ingredients.

43:14.340 --> 43:16.460
Would you all excuse me, please?

43:18.620 --> 43:21.579
Why can't she stick
to strawberry scones?

43:21.580 --> 43:24.299
The poor girl's been
poisoned once already.

43:24.300 --> 43:25.860
I like curry.
