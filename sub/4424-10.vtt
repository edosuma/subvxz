00:37.747 --> 00:40.207
Friends, we gather in this place

00:40.332 --> 00:42.835
to mourn the victims
of yesterday's tragedy,

00:42.960 --> 00:46.088
nine good people
who were run over in the street

00:46.213 --> 00:48.132
by an elderly woman driver.

00:48.257 --> 00:51.385
Oh, God, memorial services
are so boring.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.596
You insensitive asshole,
Cartman!

00:53.721 --> 00:54.889
Nine people died!

00:55.014 --> 00:56.557
Yeah, but like eight of them
were hippies.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.350
Mostly hippies go
to farmer's markets.

00:58.476 --> 00:59.435
Mostly.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.021
It is sometimes hard
in times like these

01:02.146 --> 01:03.606
to understand God's way.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.483
Why would he allow
nine innocent people

01:05.608 --> 01:07.443
to be run down
in the prime of their lives

01:07.568 --> 01:10.654
by a senior citizen who perhaps
shouldn't be driving?

01:10.780 --> 01:12.740
It is then
that we must understand

01:12.865 --> 01:15.409
God's sense of humor
is very different from our own.

01:15.534 --> 01:18.454
He does not laugh at the simple
"man walks into a bar" joke.

01:18.579 --> 01:19.538
No.

01:19.663 --> 01:21.457
God needs complex irony

01:21.582 --> 01:24.502
and subtle farcical twists
that seem macabre to you and me.

01:24.627 --> 01:28.214
All that we can hope for
is that God got his good laugh

01:28.339 --> 01:30.925
and a tragedy such as this
will never happen again.

01:31.050 --> 01:32.384
Look out!

01:33.969 --> 01:36.931
Ah!
Was that a stop sign back there?

01:44.396 --> 01:48.400
Oh, I think I hit a pothole.

01:49.985 --> 01:52.446
Hey, Dad, how come they let
old people drive?

01:52.571 --> 01:55.950
Well, Stan,
it's a very fragile issue.

01:56.075 --> 01:57.493
But they kill people.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.994
Sometimes, yes.

01:59.120 --> 02:03.249
But senior citizens have to be
dealt with very gingerly, Stan.

02:03.374 --> 02:05.334
We can't just take
their licenses away.

02:05.459 --> 02:09.130
I'll be God damned if they think
they can take my license away!

02:09.255 --> 02:11.507
Oh, hi, Dad.
- I heard what you said!

02:11.632 --> 02:14.593
You want to take driving
privileges away from seniors!

02:14.718 --> 02:17.096
Well, let me tell you something,
pecker face,

02:17.221 --> 02:19.348
I worked 55 years
in a steel mill...

02:19.473 --> 02:20.182
Yes, Dad.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.601
...and I flew Spitfires
over Germany in World War II...

02:22.726 --> 02:23.435
Yes, I know.

02:23.561 --> 02:25.771
...and I will be God damned
if the government thinks

02:25.896 --> 02:29.650
it can step in and take away
my right to drive!

02:29.775 --> 02:31.735
I think old people
should have rights, Grandpa.

02:31.861 --> 02:33.571
I just don't want to die.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.209
Damn it, Mona,
this isn't the fastest way

02:47.334 --> 02:48.627
to Country Kitchen Buffet.

02:48.752 --> 02:52.256
No, but it's the shortest.
Save the most gas that way.

03:00.931 --> 03:01.932
You save more gas

03:02.057 --> 03:04.685
if you take the highway
to Country Kitchen Buffet!

03:04.810 --> 03:07.897
Less miles means less gas,
you old fool.

03:11.775 --> 03:14.153
There's Country Kitchen
right there!

03:14.278 --> 03:15.154
Where?

03:15.279 --> 03:17.489
Back there!
You're gonna miss it!

03:18.949 --> 03:20.284
Aah!

03:23.245 --> 03:25.539
Is this the parking lot?

03:25.664 --> 03:26.874
I think so.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.755
Another death tonight
by senior-citizen motorists.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.090
Carl Zorn of Pine Junction
was killed instantly

03:35.216 --> 03:38.052
when struck by a vehicle
driven by Pete and Lydia Melman,

03:38.177 --> 03:40.554
who were trying to find
Country Kitchen Buffet.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.723
This latest tragedy comes
only two days

03:42.848 --> 03:44.391
after the accident
in Deer Creek,

03:44.516 --> 03:46.268
where three construction workers
in a bulldozer

03:46.393 --> 03:48.854
were run down
by senior citizen Paul Thom,

03:48.979 --> 03:51.398
who was trying to find
Country Kitchen Buffet.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.859
Public outcry is forcing
the DMV to consider

03:53.984 --> 03:56.403
suspending the licenses
of all seniors over 70,

03:56.528 --> 03:58.572
though no decision
has yet to be made.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.618
Seniors of South Park,

04:02.743 --> 04:06.121
I don't know about you,
but I am mad as hell.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.122
Yeah!

04:07.248 --> 04:08.666
Yeah!

04:08.791 --> 04:13.921
I am sick of having my mental
condition come into question.

04:14.046 --> 04:14.922
Yeah!

04:15.047 --> 04:16.257
That's right!

04:16.382 --> 04:19.301
We need to let everyone know
we're pissed off

04:19.426 --> 04:22.096
and we're not gonna take it
anymore.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.097
Hear, hear!

04:23.222 --> 04:24.431
That's right, Pete.

04:24.556 --> 04:25.766
That's right.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.268
Now...

04:27.393 --> 04:33.274
can anybody remember
what we're pissed off about?

04:36.777 --> 04:40.572
I remember we're all pissed
about something.

04:40.698 --> 04:42.449
That's why we had this meeting,

04:42.574 --> 04:45.452
but I can't for the life
of me...

04:46.203 --> 04:47.121
Ooh!

04:47.246 --> 04:50.457
Was it the kids skateboarding
on the sidewalks?

04:50.582 --> 04:52.293
No.

04:52.418 --> 04:53.377
Oh, I remember.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.337
They're going to take
our licenses away!

04:55.462 --> 04:57.214
Yeah!
- That's right!

04:57.339 --> 05:00.718
That's right. They're gonna try
and take our licenses away.

05:00.843 --> 05:03.470
And I, for one, am mad as hell.

05:03.595 --> 05:04.972
Me too!
- Yeah! That's right!

05:05.097 --> 05:06.557
I'm mad, too.

05:06.682 --> 05:11.353
I am sick of having my mental
condition come into question.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.398
So now what are we gonna do
about it?

05:15.441 --> 05:16.650
Do about what?

05:16.775 --> 05:19.153
They're gonna take
our licenses away.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.822
They are?!
They can't do that!

05:21.947 --> 05:23.449
You said it!
- You said it!

05:23.574 --> 05:24.491
That's right.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.660
So you know what I think
we should do?

05:26.785 --> 05:30.289
I think we should have
a senior-citizens meeting --

05:30.414 --> 05:36.045
get all the seniors together at
the community center and unite!

05:36.170 --> 05:37.755
Great idea, Marvin.

05:37.880 --> 05:41.258
Wait. I-I think we're having
that meeting right now.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.303
Oh. Right.
This <i>is</i> the meeting.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.013
Right, to get them damn kids

05:46.138 --> 05:48.015
to stop skateboarding
on the sidewalks.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.016
Yeah!

05:49.141 --> 05:51.310
That's right!
- This will stop 'em.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.147
Sharon, have you seen Dad?

05:55.272 --> 05:56.315
He's not here, hon.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.442
He's having a meeting
with all the seniors in town

05:58.567 --> 06:00.110
at the community center.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.445
Oh.

06:01.570 --> 06:02.613
Wait a minute.

06:02.738 --> 06:05.366
If all the seniors in town
are at a meeting,

06:05.491 --> 06:09.036
that means that when
the meeting gets out...

06:09.161 --> 06:12.456
Every senior in town
will be driving home...

06:12.581 --> 06:15.000
At the same time.

06:15.125 --> 06:19.129
Oh my God.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.799
Get inside!

06:21.924 --> 06:23.467
Get inside!

06:24.426 --> 06:27.763
Seniors meeting getting out!
Get off the streets!

06:31.308 --> 06:33.769
All right.
Great meeting, everyone.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.854
Let's do it again sometime.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.190
So long, everybody.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.526
Goodbye, Lucy.
- See you later.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.444
Goodbye, Bill!

06:42.569 --> 06:44.780
Get off the streets!

06:44.905 --> 06:47.408
Get off the streets!

06:47.533 --> 06:49.451
Old people are driving!

06:49.576 --> 06:51.620
Run!
- Run!

06:51.745 --> 06:53.414
Oh my God!

06:53.539 --> 06:55.541
Gerald!
Where are the boys?!

06:55.666 --> 06:56.875
We've got to get out of here!

06:57.000 --> 06:58.877
The boys, Gerald!
Where are they?!

06:59.002 --> 07:00.379
T-They're...

07:00.504 --> 07:02.798
They're playing street hockey!

07:02.923 --> 07:05.801
Oh my God!

07:05.926 --> 07:08.679
With just 10 seconds to go,
the offense makes its move.

07:08.804 --> 07:11.056
Marsh heads for the goal and
passes the ball to the poor kid.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.558
The poor kid hands it off
to the Jew.

07:12.683 --> 07:13.767
The Jew shoots!
Oh!

07:13.892 --> 07:15.352
And the shot is blocked again,

07:15.477 --> 07:18.188
proving once and for all
that Jews cannot play hockey.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.607
It isn't fair.
Cartman's fatter than the goal.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.651
I'm not fat.
I just have a sweet hockey body.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.778
Get off the streets!

07:24.903 --> 07:26.905
Get off the streets!

07:27.030 --> 07:28.157
Dude, look.

07:28.282 --> 07:31.910
Get off...the streets!

07:32.035 --> 07:33.996
Get off the streets!

07:34.121 --> 07:35.998
- What is that?
- I don't know.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.374
Get off!

07:37.499 --> 07:40.461
Get! Streets!
Off the streets!

07:40.586 --> 07:42.504
Dude, is that your dad?
- I think so.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.840
Looks like Stan's dad's
been hittin' the bottle again.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.508
Streets!

07:46.633 --> 07:48.760
What is he saying?
- I can't understand him.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.387
Aah!

07:50.512 --> 07:51.847
Calm down.

07:51.972 --> 07:55.017
We cannot understand you.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.560
Mrph rm!

07:59.688 --> 08:01.273
Oh, Jesus!

08:01.398 --> 08:02.274
Old people!

08:02.399 --> 08:03.859
Come on!

08:06.820 --> 08:08.447
Oh, God! They're coming!

08:08.572 --> 08:10.991
Get over there.
Stay low!

08:11.116 --> 08:13.202
Why are they all out driving
at the same time?

08:13.327 --> 08:14.495
Shh!

08:20.334 --> 08:23.086
It's okay, boys. They're gone.

08:23.212 --> 08:25.255
Let's just lay low for a minute
until we can find --

08:26.673 --> 08:29.510
I don't remember
there being a building here.

08:29.635 --> 08:31.345
Run!

08:33.514 --> 08:36.725
I told you to turn left, Larry.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.852
Get up the stairs!
Up the stairs!

08:38.977 --> 08:40.479
Come on!
Come on!

08:40.604 --> 08:42.189
Aah! There's another one!

08:43.649 --> 08:47.319
Excuse me.
Is this Costello Avenue?

08:48.487 --> 08:50.739
In here!

08:55.869 --> 08:58.038
They're not gonna stop
until we're all dead!

08:58.163 --> 09:00.165
Quiet!
Keep quiet!

09:00.290 --> 09:01.291
Dad, I'm scared.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.293
Just keep your voices down.

09:03.418 --> 09:04.753
We'll stay the night in here.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.630
We'll stay the whole winter
if we have to.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.006
I'm not staying the winter
in this room.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.342
You just need to tell old people
they can't drive anymore.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.344
Stan, it's not that simple!

09:12.469 --> 09:14.763
Just relax
while I find the lights.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.931
Here we go.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.016
How the hell did we get up here?

09:20.102 --> 09:22.271
I told you
this was the wrong way.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.736
Tom, I'm standing outside of the
Department of Motor vehicles,

09:29.861 --> 09:31.989
where senior citizens have
until 3:00 p.m.

09:32.114 --> 09:34.241
to hand over
their driver's licenses.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.410
The new law was passed
just three days

09:36.535 --> 09:38.245
after the night of horror

09:38.370 --> 09:41.456
in which all seniors were out
driving at the same time,

09:41.582 --> 09:45.210
causing 14 deaths
and $3 million in damage.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.505
All righty.
There we go.

09:48.630 --> 09:49.631
Next.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.384
It ain't right
what you're doing.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.303
I never had an accident
in my life!

09:54.428 --> 09:57.264
That's right.
You shouldn't punish all of us.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.266
We're sorry, but this is
the only way to be sure.

09:59.391 --> 10:00.267
Next, please.

10:00.392 --> 10:01.893
There we go.

10:02.019 --> 10:04.771
But how am I supposed to get
to the grocery store?

10:04.896 --> 10:07.024
Or the pharmacy to buy medicine?

10:07.149 --> 10:10.861
Well, maybe you should be
in a nursing home, hmm?

10:10.986 --> 10:12.863
Some of us would rather die!

10:12.988 --> 10:15.407
Well, we can certainly
help you with that, too.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.576
We aren't second-class citizens.

10:17.701 --> 10:18.410
That's right.

10:18.535 --> 10:22.414
You can take our licenses,
but you'll never take our pride!

10:22.539 --> 10:23.874
Yeah.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.919
Oh, isn't this great, you guys?

10:28.045 --> 10:29.796
Being able to walk the streets
now that old people

10:29.921 --> 10:31.548
are confined to their homes,
where they belong.

10:31.673 --> 10:34.051
Billy, get in the car.

10:34.176 --> 10:37.179
I need you boys to help me
pick up my new Hoveround.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.349
Uh, Grandpa, I don't think
you're supposed to be driving.

10:40.474 --> 10:41.808
God damn it, Billy!

10:41.933 --> 10:43.685
You're supposed to listen
to your dad, right?

10:43.810 --> 10:45.479
Well, I'm your dad's dad!

10:45.604 --> 10:48.774
And that means you get in this
car before I tan all your hides!

10:50.025 --> 10:51.443
Well, look at it this way.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.612
Statistically speaking,
we're safer inside a car

10:53.737 --> 10:55.447
with an old person driving
than outside.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.199
My God, he's right.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.244
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.038
I shall not walk through
the valley of death.

11:04.623 --> 11:06.958
Guys, I don't know
if I ever told you this, but...

11:07.084 --> 11:09.711
Well, I love you guys.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.088
Except for you, Kyle.

11:11.213 --> 11:13.715
Okay.
All set?

11:16.009 --> 11:18.428
Asshole!

11:21.139 --> 11:23.350
Mrph!

11:28.730 --> 11:31.316
Uh, I think there's a
police car behind you, Grandpa.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.984
Huh?

11:33.568 --> 11:35.112
Go around.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.072
Go around, you moron!

11:37.197 --> 11:39.825
Blue Impala, pull your vehicle over.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.702
I believe that's us.
Thank God.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.083
Could I see your license,
please?

11:48.208 --> 11:50.419
I ain't got one!
You peckers took it!

11:50.544 --> 11:52.838
Well, then I'll have to take you
to jail.

11:52.963 --> 11:56.007
You just try taking me to jail,
scrotum head.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.135
You just try.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.887
Stupid son of a --

12:01.012 --> 12:02.431
God damn it.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.599
I've just got him right here,
Mr. Marsh.

12:04.725 --> 12:05.934
Oh, brother.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.145
Well, good job, Dad.
Look at you now.

12:08.270 --> 12:11.648
Oh, God damn it, don't you
lecture me, you son of a bitch.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.067
You just had to be
so damn stubborn, didn't you?

12:14.192 --> 12:16.903
Now my son is gonna talk to me
like I'm 12.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.740
We're not treating you
like children, Dad, all right?

12:19.865 --> 12:22.451
Now, I think you owe
Mr. Police Officer an apology.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.370
Who needs to apologize, hmm?
Who's a sorry-sorry?

12:25.495 --> 12:27.080
Kiss my sagging ass!

12:27.205 --> 12:28.790
Well, fine,
I was gonna bail you out,

12:28.915 --> 12:31.460
but maybe you can just sit here
and think about what you did.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.295
I won't be sitting here long.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.964
- 've already called the AARP.
- What's that?

12:36.089 --> 12:39.551
The American Association
of Retired Persons,

12:39.676 --> 12:42.220
the largest political group
in the country.

12:42.345 --> 12:45.307
When seniors like me
are being discriminated against,

12:45.432 --> 12:48.185
the AARP comes
and sets it right.

12:48.310 --> 12:51.146
And you're gonna be sorry
when they get here.

12:52.814 --> 12:56.860
And so you see, children,
Genghis Khan was a Mongol,

12:56.985 --> 12:59.946
not to be confused
with a mongoloid,

13:00.071 --> 13:02.365
like the actor Nicolas Cage.

13:02.491 --> 13:06.161
Okay. Now, who can tell me
in what year...

13:06.286 --> 13:11.750
the first film...
by the mongoloid...

13:11.875 --> 13:13.376
That's odd.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.714
Those ROTC guys
are way off course.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.303
More old people!

13:23.428 --> 13:25.722
The American Association
of Retired Persons.

13:25.847 --> 13:28.308
Stay in your seats, children.
I'll be right back.

13:30.018 --> 13:34.064
Set up a perimeter.
Bring Bravo team to Point Delta.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.566
Bravo team is go.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.985
Move! Move! Move!

13:39.110 --> 13:41.154
Let's go!
Let's go!

13:41.279 --> 13:43.323
Uh, can I help you folks
find something?

13:48.620 --> 13:50.247
Old people have gone mad!

14:02.133 --> 14:03.635
Contact!

14:03.760 --> 14:06.137
Put your hands up, young man!

14:06.721 --> 14:07.764
Marvin Marsh?

14:07.889 --> 14:08.765
Yes?

14:08.890 --> 14:11.726
I'm Bill Stewart,
president of the AARP.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.521
We've come to help the seniors
in this town fight back.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.022
Oh.
It's nice to meet you, Bill.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.065
Huh?!

14:17.190 --> 14:18.900
We came as fast as we could.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.319
We just had to stop by
Country Kitchen Buffet first.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.281
It's the nursing home!

14:24.406 --> 14:25.740
Liberate our comrades!

14:25.866 --> 14:28.243
Let's go!
- Get out of there!

14:28.368 --> 14:29.744
There, now, Mr. Johnson.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.162
We can go to the cafeteria

14:31.288 --> 14:33.582
and get you some nice cream corn
and toast.

14:35.333 --> 14:36.376
Can I help you?

14:36.501 --> 14:38.211
- Help this.

14:38.336 --> 14:39.880
The revolution is on, brother!

14:40.005 --> 14:41.840
We're taking control
of the town!

14:41.965 --> 14:44.384
We are?
Well, it's about damn time.

14:44.509 --> 14:47.137
Hey, everyone,
we're taking the town.

14:48.263 --> 14:49.556
All right.

14:49.681 --> 14:50.682
Oh.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.394
Seniors?
We're taking the town over.

14:54.519 --> 14:56.396
The revolution is on!

14:56.521 --> 14:58.064
Oh, the revolution?

14:58.189 --> 15:01.151
Oh, I better get
my other sweater.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.738
Mrs. Ryland, seniors
are taking over the town.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.072
Would you like a gun?

15:06.197 --> 15:08.158
Oh, I suppose so.

15:08.283 --> 15:09.743
What the hell is going on?

15:09.868 --> 15:12.078
Shut your piehole
and get over there.

15:12.787 --> 15:14.039
Randy, what is this?

15:14.164 --> 15:17.542
Huh?! You are now under
the authority of the AARP.

15:18.627 --> 15:20.921
Ha!
There you go, Mr. Smart Mouth.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.255
Look at you now!

15:22.380 --> 15:23.632
Dad, what are you doing?

15:23.757 --> 15:25.967
The AARP is going to help us
take this town

15:26.092 --> 15:28.178
until we get our licenses back!

15:28.303 --> 15:31.431
Yeah. And we're gonna ask
for more money in Medicare, too.

15:31.556 --> 15:32.933
That's right.
- Yeah!

15:33.058 --> 15:34.601
Have you all got Alzheimer's?

15:34.726 --> 15:35.894
They're not gonna listen

15:36.019 --> 15:37.562
to a bunch of whacked-out
senior citizens.

15:37.687 --> 15:38.480
Huh?!

15:38.605 --> 15:40.857
We'll tell 'em if they don't
give us our demands,

15:40.982 --> 15:42.859
we'll start killing hostages.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.070
Right. They're gonna
really believe that.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.406
Isn't that a little extreme, Bill?

15:48.531 --> 15:50.742
Huh?!
No. We got to be tough.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.744
Just like with those damn Japs.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.120
This is insane, Dad.

15:54.245 --> 15:57.082
You all need to stop right now
before more people get hurt.

15:57.207 --> 16:00.877
The time when you can tell me
what to do is over, bucky boy.

16:01.002 --> 16:03.088
<i>We 're</i> in charge now.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.345
All right.

16:10.470 --> 16:14.015
We've got control of the mayor's
office and the fire station.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.934
Reinforcements have arrived

16:16.059 --> 16:18.144
from the nursing home
in Conifer.

16:18.269 --> 16:18.728
Good!

16:18.853 --> 16:21.982
Hell, us senior citizens could
take over the entire country.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.942
We've got company.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.613
Attention, seniors.

16:28.738 --> 16:32.283
Lay down your weapons
and turn yourselves over.

16:32.409 --> 16:35.328
Mrs. Applegate,
show 'em we mean business.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.205
All right.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.498
Ooh!

16:38.623 --> 16:40.083
Aah!

16:42.085 --> 16:43.795
What do you want?

16:43.920 --> 16:44.796
Huh?!

16:44.921 --> 16:47.632
We want our licenses back!

16:47.757 --> 16:48.675
Yeah!

16:48.800 --> 16:51.886
That's right. And we want
more money in Medicare!

16:52.012 --> 16:53.263
Yeah!

16:53.388 --> 16:55.098
And we want those damn kids

16:55.223 --> 16:57.851
to stop skateboarding
on the sidewalks!

16:57.976 --> 16:59.811
Yeah!

17:04.941 --> 17:05.734
Hey, Dad.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.861
Stan! Boys!
You're safe.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.779
Dad, why is everyone letting
the old people do this?

17:09.904 --> 17:11.114
Why doesn't somebody stop them?

17:11.239 --> 17:12.699
They've tried to stop them, son,

17:12.824 --> 17:15.118
but the seniors get up
so early in the morning,

17:15.243 --> 17:17.912
they get everything done before
everyone else is even awake.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.165
They're saying something about
taking over the whole country.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.207
Yes.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.043
And now,
seeing how early they get up,

17:23.168 --> 17:25.086
I don't see how anyone
can stop them.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.796
Wait a minute.
You boys!

17:26.921 --> 17:28.590
You get up almost as early
as they do.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.591
You can fight them.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.634
Oh, come on, Dad.
Can't you guys do it?

17:31.760 --> 17:34.512
No, son.
We...like to sleep in.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.890
Two hostages
come front and center!

17:37.015 --> 17:37.974
They're coming.

17:38.099 --> 17:39.476
Get out of here
before they see you.

17:39.601 --> 17:42.312
Run to the hills and find
a way to fight them. Go!

17:42.812 --> 17:45.315
Boys!
Avenge me!

17:45.440 --> 17:47.650
Avenge me!

17:49.110 --> 17:50.111
All right.
Check it out.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.613
Kenny did reconnaissance
on the town.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.823
The old people have blockades
here and here.

17:53.948 --> 17:56.326
Old ladies are keeping watch
in towers around the perimeter.

17:56.451 --> 17:57.660
The leaders,
along with my grandpa,

17:57.786 --> 17:59.204
are most likely
in the mayor's office.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.498
So our only solution
is to cut off their life force.

18:01.623 --> 18:02.916
We can't fight them, Cartman.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.584
No, but we can sneak into town

18:04.709 --> 18:07.545
and shut down
their food supply -- here.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.047
Country Kitchen Buffet?

18:09.172 --> 18:10.840
Yeah. You take out
Country Kitchen Buffet,

18:10.965 --> 18:12.175
and old people won't know
what to do.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.635
That's a retarded idea, Cartman.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.804
Is it? Two years ago they closed
the Country Kitchen Buffet

18:15.929 --> 18:16.805
in Steamboat Springs,

18:16.930 --> 18:19.390
and all the old people died of
starvation in less than a week.

18:19.516 --> 18:20.934
Yeah.
I remember hearing about that.

18:21.059 --> 18:24.270
Even if it could work, how would
we go about shutting it down?

18:24.395 --> 18:27.315
I think I have a plan.
But we'll have to do it tonight.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.693
We'll start
by sneaking into town

18:30.819 --> 18:33.029
cleverly disguised
as black people.

18:33.154 --> 18:34.948
At 5:45,
Kenny and Kyle split off

18:35.073 --> 18:36.950
and set a diversion
on the east side of town.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.703
Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak
into the mayor's office

18:40.829 --> 18:43.248
and steal some of the explosives
the old people have stashed.

18:43.373 --> 18:45.917
9:00, we rendezvous
at the Country Kitchen Buffet,

18:46.042 --> 18:48.753
where we strap the explosives
and the timer to Kyle's chest.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.130
We say our tearful goodbyes
to Kyle,

18:50.255 --> 18:51.923
and then we send him inside.

18:54.968 --> 18:55.844
Yeah!
- All right!

18:55.969 --> 18:57.428
Mrph rm!
- I did it!

18:59.305 --> 19:01.975
Yeah, or we just go
to Country Kitchen Buffet

19:02.100 --> 19:04.352
and lock it from the inside
so the seniors can't get in.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.980
Well, right.
Or we do -- do that.

19:09.190 --> 19:10.108
All right, everyone.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.485
Round up your ammunition
and get ready to move.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.696
We're taking this war
further out!

19:14.821 --> 19:16.531
All right!
- Revolution!

19:16.656 --> 19:18.116
Let's go!
- Look, Bob.

19:18.241 --> 19:21.995
Uh, I appreciate what the AARP
is trying to do for us,

19:22.120 --> 19:25.415
but, uh, all we want
is our licenses back.

19:25.540 --> 19:26.749
Huh?!
Heck, no!

19:26.875 --> 19:28.418
This is going too well.

19:28.543 --> 19:30.461
We're gonna take
the whole country back,

19:30.587 --> 19:32.881
wipe out everyone
below the age of 65.

19:33.006 --> 19:35.758
Wipe 'em out?
What are you, senile?

19:35.884 --> 19:37.260
Come on, everyone!

19:37.385 --> 19:39.929
It's time to plan phase two!

19:41.389 --> 19:42.932
What the heck?

19:43.933 --> 19:45.852
Huh?
What is this?

19:45.977 --> 19:48.563
It's 6:00 a.m.
Country Kitchen should be open.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.857
I-It's not open?
H-Has to be.

19:52.984 --> 19:53.943
Try a window.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.572
They're blocked from the inside!

19:57.697 --> 19:58.573
No.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.242
No. Let us in!
Let us in!

20:01.367 --> 20:02.744
Open the doors!

20:02.869 --> 20:05.288
It's 6:00 a.m.!
- It's 6:00 a.m.!

20:05.413 --> 20:06.372
We're hungry!

20:06.497 --> 20:08.208
Open the Country Kitchen Buffet!

20:08.333 --> 20:10.418
You have to let us in!

20:20.970 --> 20:23.514
All right, everyone.
Area secure.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.434
Collect their weapons
and free the hostages.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.811
That was a great strategy, boys.

20:28.937 --> 20:31.564
You may very well have saved
this entire country.

20:31.689 --> 20:34.400
What happened?
Is it over?

20:34.525 --> 20:35.735
Everything is fine.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.029
Control of the town
is back to you folks.

20:38.154 --> 20:41.032
Country Kitchen.
W-What happened?

20:41.157 --> 20:42.533
Sir, what should we do
with this one?

20:42.659 --> 20:44.202
It's up to the townspeople.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.746
Well, I think he learned
his lesson, huh?

20:46.871 --> 20:48.498
Don't you feel silly now, Dad?

20:48.623 --> 20:50.583
I think somebody owes us all
an apology.

20:50.708 --> 20:51.751
Yes, he does.

20:51.876 --> 20:54.003
Oh, stop it, Dad.
This is partly your fault.

20:54.128 --> 20:54.796
Huh?

20:54.921 --> 20:57.298
All Grandpa wants is not to be
talked to like a child.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.800
I think half
of what he was angry about

20:58.925 --> 21:00.760
wasn't what you were doing,
but how you were doing it.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.220
That's right.

21:02.345 --> 21:03.554
And, Grandpa,
you should be proud

21:03.680 --> 21:05.014
you made it though life
to be a senior.

21:05.139 --> 21:07.433
But you should also realize that
when you get behind the wheel,

21:07.558 --> 21:08.518
you're a killing machine.

21:08.643 --> 21:09.769
I know.

21:09.894 --> 21:12.021
I guess sometimes us seniors
need to know

21:12.146 --> 21:13.356
when to stop driving

21:13.481 --> 21:16.150
so we don't put the
responsibility on our families.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.653
Well, I think this has been
a real learning experience

21:18.778 --> 21:19.988
for the Marsh family.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.365
People died,
but we all grew a little.

21:22.490 --> 21:23.700
Let's just go home.

21:23.825 --> 21:25.702
Sure.
I'll drive.

21:25.827 --> 21:28.037
That's our Grandpa.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.083
Dude, I hate my family.
