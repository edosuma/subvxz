WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:04.186
The indictment would be
second-degree murder.

00:04.187 --> 00:06.322
'You should get your affairs
in order.'

00:06.323 --> 00:07.523
We got our funding.

00:07.524 --> 00:09.724
We just work so well together.

00:11.395 --> 00:12.661
I'm, I'm so sorry.

00:12.662 --> 00:15.664
- I, I can't do this.
- Why not?

00:15.665 --> 00:17.633
Because I have a boyfriend.

00:17.634 --> 00:20.336
The network loves
your whole wild-child antics

00:20.337 --> 00:23.371
but the drugs and the booze
have got to stop.

00:28.545 --> 00:30.279
Is everything okay?

00:30.280 --> 00:31.647
There's something I have to tell you.

00:31.648 --> 00:33.416
You cheated on me?

00:33.417 --> 00:35.251
- I'm sorry.
- We're done.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.453
Jake, stop!

00:37.454 --> 00:39.522
Harper leaked to "Variety"
that she's starring opposite me

00:39.523 --> 00:40.689
in "Redemption Ridge."

00:40.690 --> 00:42.658
She's just as manipulative
as my mother.

00:42.659 --> 00:45.526
I can't deal
with these manipulative people.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

01:19.262 --> 01:21.597
I'll have to ask you to
put your seat back for landing.

01:21.598 --> 01:23.199
Well, of course.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.534
And I'm sorry.
I-I hope it's not a bother.

01:25.535 --> 01:27.369
- What's your name?
- Cindy.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.710
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:50.427 --> 01:52.860
- Ready, Ms. Townsen?
- Let's do this.

01:56.399 --> 01:58.701
'Paige, did you and Jake break up?'

01:58.702 --> 02:02.304
Where is Rainer?
Did you stay in New York?

02:02.305 --> 02:06.175
'Why didn't you
go on "Kelly And Ryan?"'

02:06.176 --> 02:10.312
'Paige, did you
suspect Shane was your stalker?'

02:10.312 --> 02:12.214
'Is this going to
interfere with the movie?'

02:12.215 --> 02:14.283
'Paige, who are you dating right now?'

02:14.284 --> 02:17.752
'Paige, any comment about
your personal life at this time?'

02:22.559 --> 02:24.493
'What is Jordan doing?'

02:24.494 --> 02:26.527
Welcome home, Ms. Townsen.

02:27.497 --> 02:29.365
Thanks, Jack.

03:21.218 --> 03:22.583
Hey.

03:23.486 --> 03:26.188
It's late. You okay?

03:29.626 --> 03:31.627
I know what you need.

03:51.514 --> 03:54.483
You wouldn't think bourbon
goes well with chocolate cake

03:54.484 --> 03:56.851
but you'd be wrong.

04:11.368 --> 04:13.502
I don't wanna waste
your dad's money, Billy.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.638
We're not going to waste their money.

04:15.639 --> 04:18.440
We're gonna finish our fantastic film.

04:18.440 --> 04:21.610
I just wanna think about it, okay?

04:21.611 --> 04:24.812
I don't wanna keep bulldozing
my way through Georgia.

04:26.516 --> 04:29.184
Well, maybe it's not
the right thing for me.

04:29.185 --> 04:32.354
I keep trying to make something work

04:32.355 --> 04:34.755
but that maybe just isn't meant to be.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.540
'Rainer, it's me again.'

04:51.541 --> 04:53.309
'Please call me. You were
supposed to be home hours ago.'

04:53.310 --> 04:55.476
'And I don't know where you are.'

05:32.248 --> 05:34.516
Is that Alexis Glenn?

05:58.441 --> 06:00.408
- 'Here you go.'
- Thanks, bro.

06:11.388 --> 06:13.355
'Hey, Jordan!'

06:13.356 --> 06:14.523
Hey, Tang.

06:14.524 --> 06:18.160
- 'Congratulations, Jay.'
- For what?

06:18.161 --> 06:20.295
I'm down in the gym, right?

06:20.296 --> 06:23.365
And guess what comes on
the morning news?

06:23.366 --> 06:26.435
The Oscar nominations!
And you're one of them.

06:27.570 --> 06:29.405
You so deserve it.

06:29.406 --> 06:31.240
Wow. Really?

06:31.241 --> 06:33.475
'Would I lie about that?'

06:33.476 --> 06:36.378
Great.

06:36.379 --> 06:37.646
I could celebrate my win in prison.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.215
Wait. What are you talking about?

06:40.216 --> 06:41.450
Did you hear something?

06:41.451 --> 06:44.520
The judge decides today if
they've got a case against me.

06:44.521 --> 06:47.289
- When?
- Uh, this afternoon.

06:47.290 --> 06:48.557
I have to go to my lawyer's office.

06:48.558 --> 06:50.225
I'll come with you, okay?

06:50.226 --> 06:51.326
I was supposed to record with Pablo

06:51.327 --> 06:52.394
but I'm gonna reschedule.

06:52.395 --> 06:54.396
No, I don't want anyone around

06:54.397 --> 06:55.597
when I hear it.

06:55.598 --> 06:57.332
It's gonna be okay.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.600
God, I hope you're right.

06:58.601 --> 07:00.335
'Just call me when you're done, okay?'

07:00.336 --> 07:02.204
We'll get a drink at the bar tonight.

07:02.205 --> 07:04.273
Are you sure
Pablo's alright with that?

07:04.274 --> 07:06.542
Just call me when you're done, Jay.

07:06.543 --> 07:09.310
- Congratulations.
- 'Thank you.'

07:45.315 --> 07:46.781
Alexis?

07:59.295 --> 08:01.429
Shit.

08:11.474 --> 08:13.474
What the hell?

08:26.589 --> 08:28.423
So you see that note there?

08:28.424 --> 08:29.625
Should it be higher, like..

08:29.626 --> 08:33.529
♪ Rolling down the road
rolling down the road ♪

08:33.530 --> 08:35.496
Or we could take it under the track.

08:35.498 --> 08:39.500
♪ Rolling down the road
rolling down the road ♪

08:40.436 --> 08:41.570
'Pablo, what's wrong?'

08:41.571 --> 08:44.473
Your boy got the Oscar now.

08:44.474 --> 08:46.674
All the talk shows buzzin' about it.

08:47.644 --> 08:49.545
- You know about that?
- Yeah.

08:49.546 --> 08:51.413
I heard about it this morning.

08:51.414 --> 08:53.482
'Must be a interesting time
for Jordan.'

08:53.483 --> 08:56.451
I mean, the prospect of going to jail

08:56.452 --> 08:58.320
and winning a Oscar..

08:58.321 --> 09:00.289
I know I'd be confused.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.124
'How does he feel about this?'

09:02.125 --> 09:05.460
Yeah. He is confused and worried.

09:05.461 --> 09:08.530
- So you talked to him?
- I ran into him in the lobby.

09:08.531 --> 09:10.332
'Look, do you wanna talk about this'

09:10.333 --> 09:14.136
'cause, well, you seem angry at me.

09:17.507 --> 09:20.407
You don't wanna see
who's trying to call you?

09:24.380 --> 09:26.313
It's my mom.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.351
'Hey, ma.'

09:29.352 --> 09:30.519
What?

09:30.520 --> 09:32.487
Oh, my God! Yeah.

09:32.488 --> 09:34.389
Of course, yeah.

09:34.390 --> 09:37.391
'Oh, just give me 30 minutes.
Okay. Bye.'

09:39.329 --> 09:41.196
Look, I'm so sorry

09:41.197 --> 09:44.266
but I have to go.

09:44.267 --> 09:47.269
It's Alexis.
She's missing or something.

09:47.270 --> 09:49.237
'My mom and Sloane
need help finding her.'

09:49.238 --> 09:51.239
How about you let your mom
and the police

09:51.240 --> 09:53.175
and whoever else go look for?

09:53.176 --> 09:56.577
You're always interrupting work
with your drama.

09:57.580 --> 09:59.414
I'm done with it.

09:59.415 --> 10:01.516
You can't be serious right now.

10:01.517 --> 10:04.620
I'm dead serious.

10:04.621 --> 10:07.255
You walk out..

10:07.256 --> 10:09.423
...our partnership is over.

10:10.393 --> 10:14.262
So you're just gonna drop the album

10:14.263 --> 10:17.199
abandon all the music
we've been working on together?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.600
Nah.

10:18.601 --> 10:20.469
I'mma finish the album

10:20.470 --> 10:22.436
just without you.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.674
Threaten me all you want, Pablo

10:25.675 --> 10:28.375
but I've got more music in me.

10:32.348 --> 10:34.483
And get your stuff
out of my suite, okay?

10:34.484 --> 10:36.551
Just leave your keys at the front desk

10:36.552 --> 10:39.386
'cause I'm done with your drama.

10:57.343 --> 11:01.079
- 'Alright, can you get him..'
- You ready?

11:01.080 --> 11:03.714
Well, was anyone ever really
ready for the gallows, Alan?

11:05.318 --> 11:07.085
So how many critics
are gonna be there?

11:07.086 --> 11:09.321
Usual trolls. Half a dozen.

11:09.322 --> 11:11.190
And, uh, board members?

11:11.191 --> 11:13.559
Oh, no one's missing
this banquet, Nina.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.194
The knives are sharpened.

11:15.195 --> 11:16.462
This is my last shot, Alan.

11:16.463 --> 11:18.564
Well, my bacon's on the line, too.

11:18.565 --> 11:20.499
If they hate "Locked," I'll be
carrying my cardboard box

11:20.500 --> 11:22.301
off the lot, same as you.

11:22.302 --> 11:23.701
Nice pep talk.

11:28.274 --> 11:31.443
Yes, I called Cedar's. Yes, I'll hold.

11:31.444 --> 11:33.512
- Alexis Glenn.
- 'Ah, okay.'

11:33.513 --> 11:36.181
Yes. Please call me
if you hear anything.

11:36.182 --> 11:37.182
- 'We will, ma'am.'
- Thank you.

11:37.183 --> 11:39.283
- 'You're welcome.'
- Ah. Hey.

11:40.487 --> 11:42.554
Hey. Did anyone find her yet?

11:42.555 --> 11:45.123
Okay, you have my number,
so please call me

11:45.124 --> 11:47.426
as soon as you hear anything.
Thank you.

11:47.427 --> 11:49.428
- What is that?
- 'That's the note she left.'

11:49.429 --> 11:51.296
I'm trying to pinpoint her
on social media.

11:51.297 --> 11:52.397
People are posting videos.

11:52.398 --> 11:54.333
So it's like a Snapchat.
Where's Waldo?

11:54.334 --> 11:55.567
I was working last night

11:55.568 --> 11:57.436
so I didn't know
any of this was happening.

11:57.437 --> 11:58.570
Why didn't you call me sooner?

11:58.571 --> 12:00.539
You guys weren't exactly friends
lately, Tang.

12:00.540 --> 12:02.541
You let Pablo get her
kicked out of the Bixby.

12:02.542 --> 12:05.244
I still care about her, Sloane.

12:05.245 --> 12:06.378
So after she chopped off all her hair

12:06.379 --> 12:08.113
why didn't someone stay with her?

12:08.114 --> 12:10.148
'Hey, excuse you. Someone did stay.'

12:10.149 --> 12:12.351
'I did, the whole night,
but she snuck out.'

12:12.352 --> 12:13.485
The last time anyone saw her

12:13.486 --> 12:16.355
was runnin' across
Ventura Boulevard this mornin'.

12:16.356 --> 12:19.424
The valley? I didn't even know
she knew how to get there.

12:19.425 --> 12:21.326
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

12:21.327 --> 12:25.197
- Poor Alex.
- Hello? Yes.

12:25.198 --> 12:27.732
- Oh, God. Really?
- What? Is she okay?

12:30.203 --> 12:31.336
Okay. Okay.

12:31.337 --> 12:34.206
Well, thank you, officer.

12:34.207 --> 12:36.141
- She's been arrested.
- For what?

12:36.142 --> 12:38.210
They found her passed out
in some kid's bunk bed.

12:38.211 --> 12:39.211
- What?
- Yeah.

12:39.212 --> 12:41.146
The mom went
to get her kids up for school

12:41.147 --> 12:42.548
found Alexis there instead.

12:42.549 --> 12:46.350
And Alexis' mugshot
has already gone viral.

12:47.253 --> 12:48.453
Hey, mom, how much is the bail?

12:48.454 --> 12:50.422
No. They're not pressin' any charges.

12:50.423 --> 12:53.191
Apparently, the mom
was a big fan of "Backsplash"

12:53.192 --> 12:55.193
but the police
have put her under a 51-50.

12:55.194 --> 12:58.263
- A 51 what?
- A psych hold, honey.

12:58.264 --> 12:59.431
They're taking her
to the county hospital

12:59.432 --> 13:00.465
right now. Let's go.

13:00.466 --> 13:05.170
I just want to take a little time off.

13:05.171 --> 13:07.205
- How long?
- A year.

13:07.206 --> 13:08.473
Guess how many films
Jennifer Lawrence shot

13:08.474 --> 13:11.476
in the year after she made
"Winter's Bone?"

13:11.477 --> 13:13.312
- I have no idea.
- 'Five.'

13:13.313 --> 13:15.414
Including "X-Men," "The Hunger Games"

13:15.415 --> 13:18.250
and "Silver Linings Playbook"
in which she won the Oscar.

13:18.251 --> 13:20.485
'Do you know who took a year off
after her first hit?'

13:20.486 --> 13:22.354
- No. Who?
- 'Neither do I.'

13:22.355 --> 13:24.156
Because she's not
in the industry anymore.

13:24.157 --> 13:25.424
That's how this works.

13:25.425 --> 13:28.126
That happened
less than three days ago.

13:28.127 --> 13:29.428
I'm calling a carpenter to fix that.

13:29.429 --> 13:31.163
And I'm having nightmares.

13:31.164 --> 13:32.531
I'll give you
a list of good therapists.

13:32.532 --> 13:35.233
- Jake and I broke up.
- Happens.

13:35.234 --> 13:37.469
Fame is gonna put you
out of sync with some people.

13:37.470 --> 13:39.571
I don't know that I wanna
do this anymore, Joanie.

13:39.572 --> 13:42.207
I mean, "Locked"
hasn't even come out yet

13:42.208 --> 13:45.210
and people already think
that they know me.

13:45.211 --> 13:47.145
They ask me personal questions.

13:47.146 --> 13:49.314
They take photos of me, they stalk me.

13:49.315 --> 13:52.150
- They...
- Paige, s-stop.

13:52.151 --> 13:53.518
What are you gonna do with a year off?

13:53.519 --> 13:55.354
Finish college.

13:55.355 --> 13:57.222
Well, can't you do it online?

13:57.223 --> 13:58.423
It's not a degree thing.

13:58.424 --> 14:01.360
It's about figuring things out,
you know?

14:01.361 --> 14:03.594
Trying new things and..

14:05.098 --> 14:08.666
I could switch my major
from econ to theater.

14:10.203 --> 14:11.470
When you were attacked,
did you hit your head

14:11.471 --> 14:13.205
like, really hard?

14:13.206 --> 14:14.373
No, I'm serious.

14:14.374 --> 14:16.174
Why would you go to college
to study something

14:16.175 --> 14:17.275
that you're already famous for?

14:17.276 --> 14:19.277
Because I'm not famous
for acting, Joanie.

14:19.278 --> 14:21.579
I'm famous for being famous.

14:31.290 --> 14:33.358
Why didn't you answer my calls
or text me?

14:33.359 --> 14:34.459
I've been worried.

14:34.460 --> 14:36.328
You know what this is about, Harper.

14:36.329 --> 14:38.363
You're acting like
you found this project for me

14:38.364 --> 14:40.399
when all along it was about you.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.267
It's because of me that your mother

14:42.268 --> 14:43.402
is not producing "Redemption Ridge."

14:43.403 --> 14:46.138
- I did that for you.
- Then prove it.

14:46.139 --> 14:50.108
- Sign over the rights to me.
- Why?

14:50.109 --> 14:52.309
I had an epiphany in New York.

14:52.478 --> 14:54.246
I turned to alcohol

14:54.247 --> 14:56.481
when I feel like
I've lost control of my life.

14:56.482 --> 14:58.383
That's why I want
complete control, Harper.

14:58.384 --> 15:00.285
I wanna produce this movie.

15:00.286 --> 15:03.355
And if you really got
"Redemption Ridge" for me

15:03.356 --> 15:05.357
you'll sign over the rights.

15:05.358 --> 15:06.558
I'll double whatever you paid.

15:08.127 --> 15:10.295
I optioned it for a dollar.

15:10.296 --> 15:13.230
Okay.

15:13.533 --> 15:16.134
Wh-what are you doing?

15:16.135 --> 15:17.369
Here's the test.

15:17.370 --> 15:21.106
If it's really for me,
you'll give me the rights.

15:21.107 --> 15:22.539
You're being ridiculous.

15:24.143 --> 15:27.446
Rainer, we can produce this film
and act in it together.

15:27.447 --> 15:30.514
Ray, come on. Look at me.

15:35.221 --> 15:37.521
Okay. Fine.

15:38.491 --> 15:41.226
You want proof, then..

15:41.227 --> 15:42.561
...I'll step off as producer

15:42.562 --> 15:45.696
and I'll audition for the lead
just like everyone else.

15:47.567 --> 15:49.366
Deal?

15:51.471 --> 15:52.703
Deal.

15:55.408 --> 15:58.676
Now can we please stop fighting..

15:59.545 --> 16:00.745
...and make up?

16:03.216 --> 16:04.483
I'll have my lawyers send the contract

16:04.484 --> 16:06.517
over to your apartment.

16:12.091 --> 16:13.291
Maybe you two can work it out.

16:13.292 --> 16:15.293
I don't even know if I want to.

16:15.294 --> 16:17.329
Yeah, I know.
Jake can be pretty intense.

16:17.330 --> 16:20.499
And, yes. I cheated, okay?

16:20.500 --> 16:23.434
Which I feel horrible about.

16:24.437 --> 16:27.205
But he emotionally cheated.

16:27.206 --> 16:29.107
Yeah. I just don't get that, you know?

16:29.108 --> 16:30.275
Say whatever you want,
but I don't think

16:30.276 --> 16:31.309
it's a thing with him.

16:31.310 --> 16:32.444
No, it's a thing.

16:32.445 --> 16:35.547
He transferred all his feelings
from me to Billy

16:35.548 --> 16:37.549
when she started playing Georgia.

16:37.550 --> 16:39.084
It just makes me think that

16:39.085 --> 16:41.119
it wasn't even a real thing with us

16:41.120 --> 16:44.189
that I was just his muse.

16:44.190 --> 16:45.557
And now I'm not.

16:49.562 --> 16:52.097
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:52.098 --> 16:55.200
Can I use your bathroom? The
traffic was horrible on the 405.

16:55.201 --> 16:57.401
- Yeah. Totally.
- Cool. Thanks.

17:00.206 --> 17:02.374
Can I, uh, sleep in your room,
Cass? I'm exhausted.

17:02.375 --> 17:04.409
Yeah, sure.

17:04.410 --> 17:06.077
'You're not gonna just ignore me'

17:06.078 --> 17:08.180
like I'm not even here.

17:08.181 --> 17:10.048
We need to have a real conversation

17:10.049 --> 17:11.049
about what happened.

17:11.050 --> 17:13.084
What happened was..

17:13.085 --> 17:14.452
...you screwed some other guy.

17:14.453 --> 17:17.388
So you're not gonna take
any responsibility

17:17.390 --> 17:19.223
for our relationship falling apart?

17:19.224 --> 17:21.059
No.

17:21.060 --> 17:23.328
I don't see
how you cheating is my fault.

17:23.329 --> 17:25.230
'Cause nothing's ever your fault.

17:25.231 --> 17:27.299
Not waiting for me to finish "Georgia"

17:27.300 --> 17:31.369
not making me do shots the night
before my Scorsese audition

17:31.370 --> 17:33.405
not defending me

17:33.406 --> 17:37.142
when some producer just
tears me apart in front of you

17:37.143 --> 17:38.243
not moving in with me...

17:38.244 --> 17:41.313
You decided to buy that house,
Paige, not me.

17:41.314 --> 17:44.382
And you're just never gonna stop
reminding me of that.

17:44.383 --> 17:46.583
- Ah..
- Excuse me. Sorry.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.558
Why don't you just admit it?

17:53.559 --> 17:56.561
You've had feelings for her,
probably, since the first night

17:56.562 --> 17:58.396
you guys met rewriting that script.

17:58.397 --> 18:01.199
Oh, wait. No.
You can't do that, right?

18:01.200 --> 18:04.301
Because nothing's ever your fault.

18:18.968 --> 18:22.062
That's fine. Just leave
them in the room.

18:24.772 --> 18:27.774
Congrats on the Oscar nom..

18:27.775 --> 18:30.577
...Mr. Michaels.

18:30.578 --> 18:32.445
It's Wilder.

18:32.446 --> 18:34.546
Yeah, whatever you say, man.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.827
This is my fault.

18:47.828 --> 18:50.630
No. It's not.

18:50.631 --> 18:53.700
No. It is, Sloane. It is.

18:53.701 --> 18:54.801
And my mom's..

18:54.802 --> 18:57.404
God, all that pressure
Ida put on her..

18:57.405 --> 18:59.506
'I just ignored
all her cries for help.'

18:59.507 --> 19:01.508
- 'God, Sloane... '
- Please, stop, Tang.

19:01.509 --> 19:03.410
This is not your fault.

19:03.411 --> 19:05.579
I need to talk to you
about this Alexis..

19:05.580 --> 19:07.414
Alright.

19:07.415 --> 19:09.783
- It's over.
- Oh, thank God.

19:09.784 --> 19:12.686
- 'Are they really seeing her?'
- No.

19:12.687 --> 19:15.589
"Alexalicious," season two.

19:15.590 --> 19:18.525
This is even too crazy for reality TV.

19:18.526 --> 19:21.628
Fans like the partyin',
the mean-girl routine

19:21.629 --> 19:23.697
and even the shoplifting

19:23.698 --> 19:25.432
but the county psych ward

19:25.433 --> 19:27.534
is apparently where
people draw the line.

19:27.535 --> 19:29.569
They cancelled "Alexalicious."

19:29.570 --> 19:33.440
Wow, mom, is that really
all you care about?

19:33.441 --> 19:36.643
Look. Look, I was trying
to salvage her career

19:36.644 --> 19:37.811
so that when she gets up out of here

19:37.812 --> 19:40.512
she has something to return to.

19:40.815 --> 19:42.681
I did my best.

19:44.485 --> 19:46.686
Wait. Mom. What, that's it?

19:46.687 --> 19:47.821
So there's no second season pick up

19:47.822 --> 19:49.422
so you're just gonna leave her?

19:49.423 --> 19:53.393
Honey, you two are here for Alexis.

19:53.394 --> 19:56.596
When she comes to, she's gonna
wanna be with you, not me.

19:56.597 --> 19:58.764
I've done what I can do.

20:11.846 --> 20:14.848
Tang. Hey, Tang.

20:14.849 --> 20:17.883
- 'What's going on?'
- Okay, don't be mad.

20:19.387 --> 20:22.489
But I needed you
to help me get out of my show.

20:22.490 --> 20:24.424
I knew that the only way
Ida would believe

20:24.425 --> 20:26.426
that I was actually going insane

20:26.427 --> 20:30.397
is if you made her believe
I was actually going insane.

20:30.398 --> 20:32.866
And clearly it worked.

20:32.867 --> 20:35.669
I got the idea from a Lifetime movie.

20:35.670 --> 20:37.771
And I could not have done it
without Sloane.

20:37.772 --> 20:38.872
Don't be mad, Tang.

20:38.873 --> 20:40.740
Please, please, don't be mad.

20:40.741 --> 20:42.475
I have enough people
mad at me right now

20:42.476 --> 20:43.843
to last an actual lifetime.

20:43.844 --> 20:45.879
I'm sorry. What..

20:45.880 --> 20:47.746
I'm sorry.

20:49.784 --> 20:51.651
Ah.

20:51.652 --> 20:54.521
- So the drugs?
- Tic Tacs.

20:54.522 --> 20:57.724
And you, you breaking into that
family's home in Encino and...

20:57.725 --> 20:59.893
I actually used to babysit for them.

20:59.894 --> 21:01.661
Oh, my gosh.

21:01.662 --> 21:03.430
Wow, you are a much better actress

21:03.431 --> 21:04.731
than I ever gave you credit for.

21:06.667 --> 21:08.535
Thanks, Tang.

21:08.536 --> 21:10.437
- 'Thank you.'
- Oh, my God!

21:10.438 --> 21:11.771
Oh, my God, but you..

21:11.772 --> 21:15.607
- Your hair..
- Well, actually..

21:21.382 --> 21:23.750
- Surprise.
- You're insane! Come here.

21:23.751 --> 21:25.685
Hm.

21:27.588 --> 21:29.856
- Mm.
- Oh, guys, I'm sorry.

21:29.857 --> 21:31.391
I love you, guys.

21:31.392 --> 21:33.560
Please hold, we'll be right there.

21:34.562 --> 21:37.464
Come in.

21:37.465 --> 21:39.466
Hey, what are you doin' here?
I thought you were in New York.

21:39.467 --> 21:40.734
I just got back. Tangey called me.

21:40.735 --> 21:42.635
Oh.

21:42.636 --> 21:43.803
Just wanted to be here for you.

21:43.804 --> 21:46.873
- Um, is that okay?
- Yeah. Thanks, man.

21:46.874 --> 21:49.843
Um, this is my friend, Rainer.
Is it okay if he joins us?

21:49.844 --> 21:52.611
Sure. Have a seat.

21:54.682 --> 21:55.682
Jordan, I have

21:55.683 --> 21:58.585
the Honorable Judge
Sandra Cho calling.

21:58.586 --> 22:01.521
Apparently, she wants to give
you her decision face to face.

22:01.522 --> 22:02.788
Um..

22:04.725 --> 22:07.460
Hello, Your Honor. You have
Jordan Michaels and myself here.

22:07.461 --> 22:09.462
Hello, Ms. Gurrea.
Hello, Mr. Michaels.

22:09.463 --> 22:11.464
Thank you for being patient with us.

22:11.465 --> 22:12.732
We needed an extra day

22:12.733 --> 22:15.801
after receiving the phone call
from Jordan's mother.

22:17.438 --> 22:18.638
'I just wanted you to hear from me'

22:18.639 --> 22:21.474
that there will be no trial.

22:21.475 --> 22:23.810
You clearly acted out of self defense.

22:23.811 --> 22:26.413
And you not only saved your own life

22:26.414 --> 22:28.448
'but that of your mother's.'

22:28.449 --> 22:30.450
'Jordan Michaels,
the State of Illinois'

22:30.451 --> 22:32.884
'will not be pursuing a case
against you.'

22:34.555 --> 22:35.822
Wait, wait. Does that..
Does this mean..

22:35.823 --> 22:39.591
It's over, Jordan. You are a free man.

22:41.595 --> 22:43.530
Oh, thank you, Judge Cho.

22:43.531 --> 22:45.931
- 'Thank you. Thank you.'
- Good luck, Jordan.

22:50.538 --> 22:52.806
- We did it, Jordan.
- Thank you, Vivian.

22:52.807 --> 22:54.573
You're welcome.

22:55.476 --> 22:58.511
Oh. Oh.

23:02.650 --> 23:04.417
- 'Jordan!'
- 'Hey!'

23:09.790 --> 23:11.758
This is your moment.

23:11.759 --> 23:13.827
Enjoy it.

23:20.501 --> 23:21.634
- 'Jordan!'
- 'Hey, Jordan!'

23:29.710 --> 23:31.576
Jordan!

23:44.859 --> 23:46.725
'Yo, what..'

23:53.634 --> 23:55.668
'What's going on?'

23:55.669 --> 23:57.703
Yo, I've been..

23:58.639 --> 24:00.605
I've been robbed!

24:05.277 --> 24:06.597
They loved it.

24:06.598 --> 24:07.763
They loved you, both of you.

24:07.764 --> 24:09.631
'And the critics were over the moon.'

24:09.632 --> 24:12.367
Your chemistry
is the stuff of movie legends.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.835
You two are like Bogart and Bacall.

24:15.638 --> 24:17.739
Gosling and Stone.

24:17.740 --> 24:20.442
Which is why we're so thrilled to have

24:20.443 --> 24:22.711
a three-picture deal in place
with both of you.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.480
'And as soon as we get
the official green light'

24:24.481 --> 24:26.748
we'll move on to sequel right away.

24:26.749 --> 24:28.617
How, uh, fast would that be?

24:28.618 --> 24:31.353
Well, it could be as fast
as a few months.

24:31.354 --> 24:33.789
You're good, Nina. Bravo.

24:33.790 --> 24:35.591
'I couldn't figure out
why you called Paige'

24:35.592 --> 24:37.526
'in to a meeting that I asked for.'

24:37.527 --> 24:39.528
But I get it now.

24:39.529 --> 24:42.397
You're an evil genius.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.632
What's wrong?

24:43.633 --> 24:45.400
You see what she's doing?

24:45.401 --> 24:46.668
Remember what we talked
about on the plane?

24:46.669 --> 24:49.605
- She's manipulating you.
- Well, she's trying to.

24:49.606 --> 24:50.806
'But now you've recognize it'

24:50.807 --> 24:52.741
so you're not gonna let her
do that to you.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.743
Hey, did you ever decide
on that Western?

24:54.744 --> 24:56.445
Yeah.

24:56.446 --> 24:58.680
- I'm producing it.
- That's awesome, Rainer.

24:58.681 --> 25:00.716
- Congrats.
- Excuse me.

25:00.717 --> 25:02.384
- What is going on here?
- Yeah?

25:02.385 --> 25:05.587
I'm doing "Redemption Ridge" next.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.356
I'd like to hold auditions here
next week, Alan.

25:07.357 --> 25:09.558
'Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on there, Spartacus.'

25:09.559 --> 25:12.461
Gold Brothers didn't agree
to greenlight that project.

25:12.462 --> 25:15.830
Oh, but they will.
Every studio in town wants it.

25:16.766 --> 25:19.334
Right, Nina?

25:19.335 --> 25:22.538
Which is perfect because I have
decided to take some time off.

25:22.539 --> 25:23.672
- What?
- 'What?'

25:23.673 --> 25:25.374
- What?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

25:25.375 --> 25:27.376
Uh, I may even decide

25:27.377 --> 25:28.777
not to come back
to the business at all.

25:28.778 --> 25:32.314
But since this meeting
was never intended for me

25:32.315 --> 25:34.515
we'll talk about all that later.

25:41.391 --> 25:43.392
- 'Hello?'
- Hey, Tang.

25:43.393 --> 25:45.394
Hey, I've been waiting
for you to call.

25:45.395 --> 25:47.763
'I heard on the
news that the DA dropped the case.'

25:47.764 --> 25:50.532
Oh, my God!
We can celebrate for real now.

25:50.533 --> 25:52.467
Yeah, Rainer's throwing me
a little thing here

25:52.468 --> 25:53.569
at the Bixby around 8 o'clock.

25:53.570 --> 25:54.703
'Perfect.'

25:54.704 --> 25:56.572
Jay..

25:56.573 --> 26:00.375
Hey, for a man who just got
nominated for an Oscar

26:00.376 --> 26:02.611
and isn't going to jail

26:02.612 --> 26:04.346
you sound awfully low.

26:04.347 --> 26:05.846
Come on. What's up?

26:06.516 --> 26:07.716
I got robbed.

26:07.717 --> 26:10.285
- What?
- They took my iPad.

26:10.286 --> 26:13.355
Oh. Well, you can just
get that replaced, right?

26:13.356 --> 26:14.623
No. I'm not worried about that.

26:14.624 --> 26:17.292
I'm worried about what was on it.

26:17.293 --> 26:20.629
Tangey, my photos, my videos, of us..

26:20.630 --> 26:23.332
'Stuff I would never upload
to the cloud.'

26:23.333 --> 26:24.632
Jordan..

26:25.635 --> 26:27.535
...you're not talking about..

26:28.671 --> 26:30.472
Yeah. Those..

26:30.473 --> 26:33.609
You told me that you've erased them.

26:33.610 --> 26:36.544
I was going to..

26:37.380 --> 26:38.913
...but I couldn't do it.

26:40.416 --> 26:43.652
Please just tell me
that it is password-protected.

26:43.653 --> 26:45.586
I'm sorry.

26:45.688 --> 26:47.522
Ah..

26:56.666 --> 26:59.601
Oh. I didn't know you had a bike.

26:59.602 --> 27:01.703
I don't.

27:01.704 --> 27:04.640
No one locks up their bikes
around here.

27:04.641 --> 27:07.474
I wanted to catch you before you left.

27:07.543 --> 27:08.677
Thank you.

27:08.678 --> 27:10.679
You really helped me back there.

27:10.680 --> 27:13.682
You didn't need my help.

27:13.683 --> 27:15.584
I think the spell is broken.

27:15.585 --> 27:19.388
I don't see Nina having control
over you anymore.

27:19.389 --> 27:21.555
I don't want this to be goodbye.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.426
Audition for "Redemption Ridge."

27:24.427 --> 27:27.596
This role, you'd be perfect for
it. If it were up to me, I'd...

27:27.597 --> 27:30.531
No, no. Of course, I'd audition.
I just..

27:31.768 --> 27:35.404
I have no idea what I'm doing next.

27:35.405 --> 27:37.506
But can I get back to you on that?

27:37.507 --> 27:38.573
Of course.

27:38.574 --> 27:41.743
Hey, um, would you audition
my friend, Cassie?

27:41.744 --> 27:43.944
She's a really great actress.

27:45.314 --> 27:47.615
For you, anything.

27:48.351 --> 27:49.751
Thanks.

27:49.752 --> 27:52.721
That's why I fell for you
in the first place.

27:52.722 --> 27:54.623
There's nothing fake about you, Paige.

28:14.744 --> 28:18.280
Promise me you won't regret that kiss.

28:18.281 --> 28:20.515
We deserved at least one without
someone telling us to do it

28:20.516 --> 28:22.516
and a hundred people watching.

28:24.587 --> 28:26.453
You want a ride?

28:28.357 --> 28:30.457
Yes. Thank you.

28:31.594 --> 28:33.528
- Come on, let's..
- Oops.

28:46.309 --> 28:50.205
Thank you so much for bringing
my clothes from home Sloane.

28:50.206 --> 28:51.306
Of course, Lex.

28:51.307 --> 28:54.209
I'm so ready
to make my grand re-entrance.

28:54.210 --> 28:55.511
I literally can't wait.

28:55.512 --> 28:57.446
I asked the nurse to come down
so you can sign out.

28:57.447 --> 28:59.415
Ugh. God, they take forever here.

28:59.416 --> 29:01.150
You know what, just don't worry
about it. Just go.

29:01.151 --> 29:02.351
I'll sign myself out
and I'll call a car

29:02.352 --> 29:03.352
and I'll meet you at the Bix.

29:03.353 --> 29:05.387
- Are you sure?
- Sloane.

29:05.388 --> 29:08.190
You have gone above and beyond.
Go home.

29:09.392 --> 29:12.194
- Visiting hours are over.
- See, she's here.

29:12.195 --> 29:14.430
It's fine. It's just paperwork.
You know how it is.

29:14.431 --> 29:17.566
Go home, get ready,
and tonight we celebrate.

29:17.567 --> 29:18.634
I can't wait.

29:18.635 --> 29:20.768
- I'll see you later, okay?
- Okay.

29:21.571 --> 29:23.337
Excuse me.

29:25.475 --> 29:26.575
Nice dress.

29:26.576 --> 29:28.444
But you can't wear those heels
in here.

29:28.445 --> 29:29.611
It could be used as a weapon.

29:29.612 --> 29:31.580
Oh. Okay.

29:31.581 --> 29:33.347
Excuse.. Mm..

29:34.250 --> 29:35.584
I'm not wearing them in here.

29:35.585 --> 29:38.353
I'm actually going to an Oscar party.

29:38.354 --> 29:40.355
So I'd like to sign out now, please.

29:40.356 --> 29:43.559
- You're on a 72-hour hold.
- Which means?

29:43.560 --> 29:45.461
You don't even get seen by a doctor

29:45.462 --> 29:48.363
until it's been 72 hours.

29:48.364 --> 29:50.199
- That's three days.
- Yeah. No, I..

29:50.200 --> 29:52.668
I know what 72 hours is.

29:52.669 --> 29:54.536
Um, that's ridiculous.

29:54.537 --> 29:57.239
So I'm here till, what, like, Monday?

29:57.240 --> 29:58.640
That's if they approve you.

29:58.641 --> 30:01.542
If not, you could be here for 30 days.

30:03.413 --> 30:05.314
That's a month.

30:05.315 --> 30:06.448
Wait, no! But this was just a joke.

30:06.449 --> 30:09.251
I have an Oscar party to get to!

30:09.252 --> 30:11.220
Hey, you can't leave me here!

30:11.221 --> 30:13.388
I'm not crazy!

30:13.389 --> 30:14.523
Let me out!

31:06.509 --> 31:08.510
Missed you so much, Adam.

31:08.511 --> 31:12.281
Okay, now, what do I need
for Iceland, seriously?

31:56.459 --> 31:58.560
Hey! Hey, let me out of here!

32:00.296 --> 32:01.563
Hey!

33:09.275 --> 33:11.409
Wow, you look great. Where you goin'?

33:11.410 --> 33:13.311
I'm meeting Paige at the Bixby.

33:13.312 --> 33:16.381
There is a party celebrating
Jordan's Oscar nomination.

33:16.382 --> 33:19.351
Um, do you bring luggage
to Oscar parties?

33:19.352 --> 33:21.186
No.

33:21.187 --> 33:23.255
I'm gonna go visit Adam in Iceland.

33:23.256 --> 33:26.258
- Really? For how long?
- 'I-I don't know.'

33:26.259 --> 33:28.193
Maybe for the rest of the time
that he's there.

33:28.194 --> 33:29.461
'I leave tomorrow.'

33:29.462 --> 33:31.463
Well, Cass,
are you sure that's a good idea?

33:31.464 --> 33:33.331
I mean, your career's taking off now.

33:33.332 --> 33:35.300
I don't think that itchy vag girl

33:35.301 --> 33:39.304
or that girl number six
is worth losing..

33:39.305 --> 33:41.705
...the love of my life over.

33:43.509 --> 33:44.542
Yeah.

33:44.543 --> 33:47.178
Was stealing Georgia
worth losing Paige over?

33:47.179 --> 33:49.381
- I didn't cheat.
- You emotionally cheated.

33:49.382 --> 33:51.416
Will you two please stop with that?

33:51.417 --> 33:53.318
Jake, I was in your movie.

33:53.319 --> 33:55.353
I saw the way
that you two are together.

33:55.354 --> 33:56.621
So you're either in love
with your work

33:56.622 --> 33:58.323
and whoever is your leading lady

33:58.324 --> 34:01.358
or you actually have feelings
for Billy.

34:04.163 --> 34:06.330
I gotta go. Bye.

34:21.179 --> 34:22.580
- 'Sure, yeah.'
- Yeah.

34:27.585 --> 34:30.255
- Thanks for throwing this, Ray.
- Of course.

34:30.255 --> 34:32.322
And for bein' there for me today.

34:33.391 --> 34:37.427
- 'Whoo!'
- Jordan, congratulations.

34:38.297 --> 34:40.165
- I'm so happy for you.
- Thank you.

34:40.166 --> 34:42.634
Rainer, I got a call
from my agent earlier.

34:42.635 --> 34:44.202
Oh, good.

34:44.203 --> 34:45.203
Thank you for considering me

34:45.204 --> 34:46.338
for "Redemption Ridge."

34:46.339 --> 34:48.172
I have no idea
how you got a hold of it

34:48.174 --> 34:51.409
since, last I heard,
my dad was producing it.

34:51.409 --> 34:53.378
But I'm sure
you'll tell me about that later.

34:53.379 --> 34:55.513
Auditioning you
was the least I could do.

34:55.514 --> 34:57.182
I know you're really talented.

34:57.183 --> 34:58.448
Thanks.

35:08.461 --> 35:11.196
Hey, sorry it's taken me so long.

35:11.197 --> 35:12.397
Friday nights are busiest night

35:12.398 --> 35:15.332
and I don't know if the post
maintenance are worth me keepi...

35:25.544 --> 35:27.278
- Jordan!
- Hey, Paige, you made it.

35:27.279 --> 35:30.181
Oh. Congrats. This is amazing!

35:30.182 --> 35:31.583
It has been an intense day.

35:31.584 --> 35:35.253
- Have you seen Tangey?
- Uh..

35:35.254 --> 35:38.223
N-no, not yet, but I've only
been here 15 minutes.

35:38.224 --> 35:39.491
Hm. Will you excuse me?

35:43.262 --> 35:45.330
- 'Oh, man!'
- 'Whoo!'

35:45.331 --> 35:46.498
'Whoo!'

35:48.534 --> 35:50.335
- 'Hello?'
- Hey, Tangey?

35:50.336 --> 35:52.270
'Look, I-I hope
you're not blowin' off my party'

35:52.271 --> 35:54.172
'because of the pictures
because I... '

35:54.173 --> 35:56.341
No, Jay, I'm mad, don't get me wrong

35:56.342 --> 35:59.409
but tonight I'm putting that aside.

36:00.179 --> 36:01.579
Okay. Good.

36:01.580 --> 36:04.482
Okay. Now can you let a girl
finish and get ready?

36:04.483 --> 36:06.251
You know I don't like to be rushed.

36:06.252 --> 36:08.752
Oh, I know that. Bye.

36:09.588 --> 36:12.190
Ooh! Thank you.

36:12.191 --> 36:13.491
- This party's pretty lit.
- I know.

36:13.492 --> 36:15.527
I'm so happy for Jordan.

36:15.528 --> 36:17.529
I have something to tell you.

36:17.530 --> 36:20.565
Really, because I have
something to tell you.

36:20.566 --> 36:23.268
- You go first.
- Okay.

36:23.269 --> 36:24.502
So it might just be for two weeks

36:24.503 --> 36:26.337
or for the rest of the year

36:26.338 --> 36:29.274
but I'm going to Iceland tomorrow.

36:29.275 --> 36:31.242
What?

36:31.243 --> 36:35.146
Wow! What about the Toby Drake movie?

36:35.147 --> 36:37.282
Ah, you know, who knows
if that's even gonna happen?

36:37.283 --> 36:38.283
Mm.

36:40.352 --> 36:43.488
And, um, did your agents

36:43.489 --> 36:45.290
call you about something?

36:45.291 --> 36:47.292
About "Redemption Ridge?"

36:47.293 --> 36:49.427
Paige, did you have something
to do with that?

36:49.428 --> 36:51.496
Why should I audition for that?

36:51.497 --> 36:53.364
- You're totally gonna get it.
- No.

36:53.365 --> 36:55.600
I'm not gonna get it 'cause
I'm not auditioning for it.

36:55.601 --> 36:57.202
What?

36:57.203 --> 36:59.237
I'm enrolling
at the University of Oregon

36:59.238 --> 37:00.438
as a theater major.

37:00.439 --> 37:01.539
Seriously?

37:01.540 --> 37:03.441
Going back home.

37:03.442 --> 37:05.477
- Have you lost your marbles?
- I think I have.

37:05.478 --> 37:07.212
That's why I have to do this.

37:07.213 --> 37:09.214
Are you sure that's the best thing?

37:09.215 --> 37:11.182
If Hollywood is meant to be

37:11.183 --> 37:13.351
then it'll be there
when I finish college.

37:13.352 --> 37:16.586
Well, I'm excited for you and sad.

37:19.158 --> 37:21.226
Excuse me. Can I get your picture?

37:21.227 --> 37:22.667
Beautiful. A little closer together.

37:37.610 --> 37:39.611
Where are you goin' all dressed up?

37:39.612 --> 37:42.412
I thought I told you
to leave your key at the desk.

37:45.251 --> 37:48.553
So you're goin' to your
little boyfriend's party, huh?

37:48.554 --> 37:51.256
I've told you
Jordan is not my boyfriend.

37:51.257 --> 37:52.290
Really?

37:52.291 --> 37:55.426
Well, why did Jordan have

37:55.427 --> 37:59.430
so many dirty little pics
and videos of you two?

37:59.431 --> 38:01.331
So you took it.

38:02.434 --> 38:05.170
- Why?
- Why?

38:05.171 --> 38:07.272
Why do you think, Tang?

38:07.273 --> 38:11.142
So I could catch you cheatin' on me.

38:11.143 --> 38:12.143
And I was right.

38:12.144 --> 38:15.213
- No.
- This is proof, okay?

38:15.214 --> 38:16.514
You lied to me, Tang.

38:16.515 --> 38:19.551
No. No! Those photos were taken
a long time ago.

38:19.552 --> 38:22.153
- Before I even met you.
- No, no, no. Shh.

38:22.154 --> 38:24.389
Listen, okay? It's not just that.

38:24.390 --> 38:27.425
It's the, the e-mails,
the texts, a lot..

38:27.426 --> 38:29.394
He is my friend.

38:29.395 --> 38:31.162
You never texted me like that.

38:31.163 --> 38:33.198
Always worried about him

38:33.199 --> 38:35.466
checkin' up on him..

38:35.467 --> 38:37.402
It was never done.

38:37.403 --> 38:40.238
You were just startin' back up.

38:40.239 --> 38:42.406
Why tag me along?

38:49.215 --> 38:51.482
Was he over here
drinkin' with you today?

38:51.483 --> 38:54.185
Listen to yourself, Pablo.

38:54.186 --> 38:56.187
This is from last night.
We were drinking together.

38:56.188 --> 38:58.256
Was he drinkin' with you today?

38:58.257 --> 39:00.124
- No!
- I don't believe that!

39:06.465 --> 39:08.265
'No!'

39:09.435 --> 39:12.170
Tang, open up, I need to talk to you.

39:12.171 --> 39:14.172
Calm down, Pablo, okay?

39:14.173 --> 39:16.107
I'll talk to you once you calm down.

39:21.447 --> 39:24.382
Like that..

39:27.386 --> 39:29.487
'Just come out so we could talk.'

39:29.488 --> 39:33.291
Open the door, Tang.

39:33.292 --> 39:35.326
'This door is made of nothing
but plywood.'

39:35.327 --> 39:38.429
Now, either you come out
or I'mma kick it down!

39:39.498 --> 39:41.299
'Stop, Pablo. Stop!'

39:43.302 --> 39:45.270
'911. What's your emergency?'

39:45.271 --> 39:48.273
This is Tangey Turner.
I'm at the Bixby, suite 431.

39:48.274 --> 39:49.607
And my boyfriend
is trying to attack me.

39:49.608 --> 39:52.343
Tang, who are you callin'?

40:06.525 --> 40:08.293
I can't hear you.

40:08.294 --> 40:10.395
What? Tangey, I can't hear you.

40:12.264 --> 40:14.464
'It's Pablo, he's trying to..'

40:17.303 --> 40:19.170
'Where is he, Tangey?'

40:20.339 --> 40:21.705
I'm comin' up.

40:23.375 --> 40:24.674
Damn it!

40:25.511 --> 40:27.444
Come on, come on, come on!

40:27.613 --> 40:29.480
Stay with me, Tangey.

40:29.481 --> 40:31.416
- I'm comin' up.
- He's tryin' to kick the door.

40:31.417 --> 40:33.418
- And please hurry up.
- I'll be right there, Tang.

40:33.419 --> 40:35.286
Stay with me.

40:39.591 --> 40:41.459
Pablo, open up. It's me, Jordan.

40:41.460 --> 40:43.527
Jordan, be careful.

40:47.599 --> 40:49.399
Let Tangey go.

41:02.314 --> 41:03.614
