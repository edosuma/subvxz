[all cheering]

10:22.083 --> 10:23.083
[music crescendoes]

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
[breathing heavily]

11:12.250 --> 11:13.750
[soft, suspenseful music playing]

11:34.666 --> 11:36.000
[alarm blaring]

11:36.083 --> 11:37.500
Wait… Hold on.

11:38.583 --> 11:39.958
What just happened?

11:40.041 --> 11:43.375
<i>Blanc. I saw you go in the engine room.</i>

11:43.458 --> 11:45.458
<i>You're the Imposter. We all know it.</i>

11:45.541 --> 11:47.541
<i>Case closed. We're done.</i>

11:47.625 --> 11:48.916
I don't understand this at all.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.375
So Angie caught me,
and now the game's just over?

11:52.458 --> 11:54.666
<i>Sorry, Blanc,</i>
<i>you're thrown out of the airlock.</i>

11:54.750 --> 11:55.791
<i>It's a no-brainer.</i>

11:55.875 --> 11:56.708
<i>I've got to say,</i>

11:56.791 --> 12:00.125
<i>the world's greatest detective…</i>
<i>I thought you'd be better at this.</i>

12:00.208 --> 12:02.250
I think maybe
this game's just not my thing.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.583
<i>Maybe we should try</i> Quiplash.

12:04.666 --> 12:06.375
-[knock on door]
-[Natasha] <i>Uh, or</i> Codenames.

12:06.458 --> 12:09.125
No. No, I… [sighs, tuts]

12:09.208 --> 12:13.250
Look, I appreciate
what y'all are trying to do for me here.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.458
<i>We're worried about you, buddy.</i>
<i>Lockdown hasn't been easy for any of us.</i>

12:16.541 --> 12:19.541
<i>But Phillip told me</i>
<i>you haven't left the bath for a week.</i>

12:19.625 --> 12:21.708
Oh, that's hyperbole.

12:21.791 --> 12:22.916
[knock on door]

12:23.000 --> 12:24.291
Get that, would ya?

12:24.916 --> 12:27.083
[Phillip] You're not in the bath again,
are you?

12:27.583 --> 12:28.958
[hesitates] No!

12:31.333 --> 12:32.750
I'm just… [sighs]

12:33.541 --> 12:35.875
I lose it between cases anyway.

12:37.333 --> 12:39.833
I think I might be going insane.
[chuckles]

12:39.916 --> 12:44.541
My mind is a fueled-up racing car,
and I got nowhere to drive it.

12:44.625 --> 12:47.083
<i>Hey, can I ask… Have you tried crosswords?</i>

12:47.166 --> 12:48.583
No, no, Natasha.

12:48.666 --> 12:53.083
I… I don't need puzzles or games.
The last thing I need is a vacation.

12:53.833 --> 12:57.791
I need danger, a hunt, a challenge.

12:58.541 --> 13:02.166
I need… a great case.

13:02.833 --> 13:05.125
[Phillip] Blanc?
There's someone here for you!

13:05.958 --> 13:07.041
With a box!

13:07.125 --> 13:08.958
[dramatic music playing]

13:50.125 --> 13:51.916
-[grunts]
-[Lionel] Claire, my dear!

13:53.416 --> 13:55.458
Hi, you genius!

13:56.500 --> 13:57.708
[horn honking]

13:59.958 --> 14:01.625
Whoo-hoo!

14:06.541 --> 14:09.875
Hello! Oh my God!

14:09.958 --> 14:11.958
-We can't hug, right?
-[Peg] No!

14:12.041 --> 14:13.083
-I mean, can we?
-Hi, Peg!

14:13.166 --> 14:14.750
-I wanna hug everybody.
-[Lionel] Elbows!

14:14.833 --> 14:16.500
-[Claire] You need help?
-[Peg] Yes, please!

14:16.583 --> 14:19.083
Did you two stay at the hotel last night?
I didn't see you.

14:19.166 --> 14:21.375
[Claire] No, Birdie,
we clearly just arrived.

14:22.708 --> 14:26.375
But you… Hello, stranger danger.

14:26.458 --> 14:29.541
[man] Mr. Blanc! You are stranger danger?

14:29.625 --> 14:33.333
[Benoit] No, that's fine, Nikos.
I don't even know what that means.

14:33.416 --> 14:36.250
[Lionel] Wait a second. Benoit Blanc?

14:36.333 --> 14:40.500
[Claire] Oh my God.
Are you Benoit Blanc, the detective?

14:40.583 --> 14:42.916
Did you solve the murder of…
Ah, what's her name?

14:43.000 --> 14:46.333
That… The ballet dancer
with the thing and the thing. That's you?

14:46.416 --> 14:48.458
[chuckling] It is, in the flesh.

14:48.541 --> 14:51.833
I'm obviously familiar
with you all as well.

14:51.916 --> 14:56.125
Governor. Dr. Toussaint. Miss Birdie Jay.

14:56.708 --> 14:59.041
What an extraordinary gathering.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.500
Crew! We've arrived.

15:14.583 --> 15:15.458
[turns off engine]

15:16.916 --> 15:19.708
Disruptors have assembled!

15:20.625 --> 15:23.000
-No, no, absolutely not.
-[Birdie] Duke!

15:23.083 --> 15:24.041
[Duke grunts]

15:24.125 --> 15:25.791
-[Lionel] The Duke.
-[Claire] Duke, hello.

15:25.875 --> 15:26.833
[Duke] Hey, guys.

15:26.916 --> 15:28.750
-Remember my girl, Whiskey?
-Hi.

15:28.833 --> 15:31.458
[Claire] Of course, Whiskey. Hello.

15:32.291 --> 15:33.333
Who's that?

15:34.041 --> 15:36.333
[Claire] Why are you in Greece, Mr. Blanc?

15:36.416 --> 15:38.208
I was invited by Miles Bron.

15:38.791 --> 15:39.750
Tight with Miles?

15:40.416 --> 15:42.166
[Benoit] No, never met.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.916
[Lionel] Oh, I get it.
The, uh… The murder mystery thing.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.666
Benoit Blanc is going to help solve
the mystery of Miles' murder.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.416
-This should be fun.
-Cute.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.000
[Benoit] Well, we'll see.

15:55.083 --> 15:56.250
[ship horn toots]

15:57.666 --> 15:58.916
[car horn honks]

16:04.208 --> 16:06.833
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Greece.

16:07.666 --> 16:10.166
This fine craft will take you
to Mr. Bron's island.

16:10.250 --> 16:12.583
It is a two-hour journey.

16:12.666 --> 16:16.916
Your captain, Mr. Andino,
will assist you with your luggage.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.958
But first, I'm gonna need you
to remove your masks

16:19.041 --> 16:20.208
and extend your tongue.

16:20.291 --> 16:22.250
This will only be
momentarily uncomfortable.

16:25.625 --> 16:27.458

16:27.541 --> 16:29.875
No pineapple in that, right?
Duke don't dance with pineapple.

16:29.958 --> 16:31.166
There's no pineapple.

-[device fires]
-[Duke gags]

16:32.375 --> 16:34.958
[Benoit] Well, it seems
I'm the odd man out, Governor.

16:35.041 --> 16:36.416
You're all friends.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.916
[Claire] Miles does one
of these weekend reunions every year.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.000
Some… nutso invitation.
Some extravagant trip.

16:43.083 --> 16:45.250
Just a little…
[in Southern accent] …menagerie.

16:45.333 --> 16:48.125
Excuse me,
I love your accent. I had to try it. Oh.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.833
-[device fires]
-Oh! [coughs]

16:49.916 --> 16:51.333
Eight years of doing these trips,

16:51.416 --> 16:53.916
you're the first new person
he's ever invited.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.500
-You must be very special.
-[Benoit] Oh! Oh, well… [chuckles]

16:56.583 --> 16:57.666
[Birdie chuckles]

16:58.791 --> 17:00.958
What is this material? I love it.

17:01.041 --> 17:02.791
-Cotton, I think.
-Sir.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.083
[Benoit] Uh…

17:05.166 --> 17:06.166
What is that?

17:06.250 --> 17:07.333
Open, please.

17:10.125 --> 17:11.083
[device fires]

17:11.916 --> 17:12.750
[coughs]

17:13.541 --> 17:14.916
You won't be needing that anymore.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.458
-[Benoit] I won't?
-You're good.

17:18.833 --> 17:19.666
[wristband beeps]

17:19.750 --> 17:22.750
What is that?
Is that some kind of disinfectant or<i>…</i>

17:22.833 --> 17:25.500
You're good. Have a great trip, everyone.

[mysterious music playing]

17:58.458 --> 18:00.666

18:01.708 --> 18:02.875
Holy shit.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.250
[dramatic music playing]

18:29.500 --> 18:33.125
[Benoit] I could not help but notice
the stir at her arrival.

18:33.208 --> 18:36.166
Yeah. That was a stir.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.083
She's not in your little gang?

18:38.166 --> 18:39.875
She was-- She is.

18:39.958 --> 18:43.291
Andi started Alpha with Miles
ten years ago, just the two of them.

18:43.875 --> 18:45.958
That's Cassandra Brand?

18:46.041 --> 18:47.250
[Lionel] Andi, yeah.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.708
And they're no longer partners?

18:49.791 --> 18:52.000
In one legal move,
he cut her out completely.

18:52.666 --> 18:55.125
Booted her without a dime,
<i>Social Network'd</i> her.

18:55.208 --> 18:59.375
Lord. But he still invited her
to this weekend?

18:59.458 --> 19:01.208
The question isn't,
"Why did he invite her?"

19:02.916 --> 19:04.791
It's, "Why did she show up?"

19:04.875 --> 19:06.375
[suspenseful music playing]

19:21.708 --> 19:23.666
Is that dock a Banksy?

19:23.750 --> 19:24.833
Pisceshite.

19:24.916 --> 19:26.708
Oh, is that the name of the island
in Greek?

19:26.791 --> 19:27.708
Pisceshite.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.416
Pisceshite. Pisceshite. [laughs]

Miles!

19:52.916 --> 19:55.208
Oh, my baby, Birdie!

I know, legit, right?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.625
But look at your face.
It was worth it. Oh!

20:07.708 --> 20:10.625
My friends, my friends,
oh, my old friends.

20:10.708 --> 20:13.083
Are we allowed to hug
after the whole Men in Black thing?

20:13.166 --> 20:16.333
-We can hug. Okay.
-Oh, God, bring it in.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.750
-[Miles] Oh! We're allowed to hug.
-Ah. Aw.

20:18.833 --> 20:19.708
[Miles] Duke!

20:19.791 --> 20:21.958
Hey, buddy. This is a dream.

20:22.041 --> 20:24.583
Not a dream, wide awake.
[straining] And it feels so good.

-I'm so good.

20:37.125 --> 20:39.166
-[Miles] Yeah?
-Mm-hmm. Great island.

20:39.250 --> 20:41.916
[Miles] Greek island, huh? Sexy, right?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.333
So, uh, Benoit Blanc, huh?

20:44.416 --> 20:45.583
-Hmm?
-[Whiskey clears throat]

20:45.666 --> 20:47.375

you do it right, buddy.

Hello.

Mr. Bron, I cannot overstate
my gratitude for this, I--

20:57.041 --> 20:58.000
So happy to meet--

[mysterious music playing]

21:08.916 --> 21:09.958
Andi.

21:11.708 --> 21:12.541
You're here.

21:13.583 --> 21:14.416
I am.

21:15.833 --> 21:18.291
All right,
when's the murder mystery start?

21:19.041 --> 21:22.291
[chuckles] My man, patience. Patience.

21:22.375 --> 21:25.125
Okay, look,
I know you guys think I'm a hippie,

21:25.208 --> 21:27.166
but can we just take a second

21:27.250 --> 21:30.166
and fully inbreathiate
this moment together?

21:30.250 --> 21:31.458
-[Duke] Mmm.
-[Whiskey inhales]

21:31.541 --> 21:34.125
We're old friends. We're still friends.

21:35.958 --> 21:36.958
And I love you all.

21:37.875 --> 21:39.041
I just wanted to say that.

21:39.125 --> 21:43.625
But we got a great weekend,
just our gang, just us.

21:43.708 --> 21:44.750
Hey, hey!

21:46.000 --> 21:46.916
Hey, bro.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.541
-I'm not here.
-[bottles clinking]

21:49.541 --> 21:50.500
Who's that?

21:51.500 --> 21:54.541
That's Derol. He's just staying here.
He's going through things,

21:54.625 --> 21:56.875
but he's not part of
the experience at all, okay?

21:56.958 --> 22:01.625
So first,
a proper tour of the Glass Onion.

22:01.708 --> 22:03.625
-[Duke] Here we go.
-[Birdie shrieks] Oh my God.

22:03.708 --> 22:07.625
The Glass Onion, like our bar!
Oh, I loved that baby so much.

22:07.708 --> 22:09.458
Should we, um, get our bags, um…

22:09.541 --> 22:11.000
[Claire] Sun is blinding.

22:11.875 --> 22:13.833
…or someone will get them for us. Okay.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.041
[Claire] I could use a second
in the shade.

22:16.125 --> 22:18.958
-This rich-people shit is weird.
-Thank you.

22:19.041 --> 22:23.208
I… I have occasionally
put on the dog in my life, but this…

22:23.291 --> 22:25.916
This is stretching
my stride-taking abilities.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.041
You're doing great. I'm Andi.

22:29.125 --> 22:31.750
That is very genial of you. I'm Benoit.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.750
-You got a flat tire there.
-Thank you.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.666
Oh, wow. Okay.

22:39.166 --> 22:40.041
Wow!

22:41.125 --> 22:43.833
It's like an actual huge glass onion.

22:43.916 --> 22:47.291
-[Claire] Yep.
-[Miles] It's past, present and future.

22:47.375 --> 22:51.708
It's what came before, where I am now,
what I'll leave to the world.

22:51.791 --> 22:52.708
Ignore me.

22:52.791 --> 22:55.958
This is the full reclamation of everything
I've achieved up to now--

22:56.041 --> 22:59.041
So, what kind of staff does it take
to run a place like this?

22:59.125 --> 23:02.875
Normally like 50, but, you know…
Look, I sent everyone home.

23:02.958 --> 23:06.125
I just wanna have a normal weekend
with my old friends like the old days.

23:06.208 --> 23:08.541
Right? See, look, that's the thing.

23:08.625 --> 23:10.791
This isn't just
a rich-asshole house. It's…

23:10.875 --> 23:12.833
I mean, it's not even a house.

23:13.458 --> 23:17.041
It's a… It's a commune. For creativity.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.583
Oh, amazing.

23:18.666 --> 23:22.625
-[male voice over speakers] <i>Dong!</i>
-[gong reverberating]

23:22.708 --> 23:23.833
What is that?

23:23.916 --> 23:27.916
That's the hourly dong.
You know I got Phil Glass to compose that?

23:28.500 --> 23:30.291
-What?
-Who's Phil Gas?

23:30.375 --> 23:33.583
Okay, let's stop talking and actually
start hanging out and having fun.

23:33.666 --> 23:35.791
Your rooms are assigned by the chakra

23:35.875 --> 23:38.083
that I most closely associate
with each of you. [chuckles]

23:38.166 --> 23:40.083
I know. Go with it, okay?

23:40.166 --> 23:42.583
Your biorhythm monitor
is the key to your room.

23:42.666 --> 23:45.291
-It'll lead you to the room using haptics.
-Oh my God.

23:45.375 --> 23:48.291
[Miles] Get settled in, change.
Let's meet up at the pool.

23:48.375 --> 23:50.958
We'll have a chill afternoon.
And then the game begins.

23:51.041 --> 23:52.375
-[monitor vibrating]
-Ooh. [gasps]

23:52.458 --> 23:56.208
Sacral! [laughs] You know me, Miles.

23:57.458 --> 23:59.083
Oh, Miles.

23:59.666 --> 24:01.750
-Ooh.
-Hey, Andi…

24:01.833 --> 24:03.791
-[Birdie gasps] Sacral!
-[Miles] I…

24:05.083 --> 24:06.333
I really am glad you're here.

24:12.208 --> 24:16.125
Wow. I… I'm sorry, but that is just crazy.

24:16.208 --> 24:18.000
-I know. Hey, Mr. Blanc.
-[Benoit] Hmm?

24:18.083 --> 24:20.500
-Could we have a quick word?
-Mmm, of course.

24:20.583 --> 24:22.583
[mysterious music playing]

24:35.583 --> 24:38.000
Oh my word. This…

24:38.083 --> 24:40.625
Oh my goodness, me. This is… [chuckles]

24:40.708 --> 24:42.958
That is<i>… </i>Wait, what is that?

24:43.041 --> 24:45.375
Oh my God, it's full of stars!

24:45.458 --> 24:48.250
2010, the year we made contact, that's…

24:48.333 --> 24:51.541
Um, this is amazing, just amazing.

24:51.625 --> 24:53.875
I… I'm so happy to be here under…

24:53.958 --> 24:57.500
If there's any role you'd like me to play
in this murder mystery game

24:57.583 --> 25:02.250
as the… I don't know, detective,
I'd be more than happy to oblige.

25:02.333 --> 25:06.125
Just to be included and to… To meet you…

25:08.333 --> 25:10.166
Is that a motorcar?

25:10.833 --> 25:12.458
Oh, yeah. That's my Baby Blue.

25:12.541 --> 25:16.000
It's one-of-a-kind. Goes anywhere I go.
All around the world.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.541
Why is it on the roof?

25:20.041 --> 25:22.083
'Cause there's nowhere to drive it
on the island.

25:22.583 --> 25:25.208
[inhales] Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.791
[Miles] Mr. Blanc, uh…

25:27.375 --> 25:28.375
I wanted to ask,

25:29.833 --> 25:31.125
what are you doing here?

25:31.708 --> 25:33.166
[spluttering] I'm sorry?

25:33.250 --> 25:34.541
What are you doing here?

25:35.666 --> 25:36.500
[scoffs]

25:37.083 --> 25:39.000
Uh, you invited me.

25:39.666 --> 25:40.750
No, I didn't.

25:41.416 --> 25:42.458
What…

25:44.791 --> 25:46.500
You sent me a box.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.083
-Wait, you received a box?
-[Benoit] Yes.

25:50.166 --> 25:55.541
The wooden box was delivered to my home
with some simple children's puzzles

25:55.625 --> 25:59.083
which, once I completed them,
there was an invitation inside.

25:59.166 --> 26:00.541
Do you have that invitation?

26:00.625 --> 26:02.166
Well, yes, I do. [laughs]

26:02.250 --> 26:05.666
I'm sorry. I'm… I'm very confused.

26:05.750 --> 26:08.708
[spluttering] Is this part of the game?

26:08.791 --> 26:09.791
[mouthing] No.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.833
This is just like the other ones,
but I didn't send it to you.

26:14.916 --> 26:16.916
[mysterious music playing]

26:19.125 --> 26:21.625
How many of these boxes did you create?

26:21.708 --> 26:25.291
-Five. One for each of my friends.
-No test boxes? No prototypes?

26:25.375 --> 26:27.750
No, my puzzle guy barely got the five done
in time,

26:27.833 --> 26:29.250
and he apprenticed with Ricky Jay.

26:29.333 --> 26:32.125
And once the boxes are open
and the puzzles completed,

26:32.208 --> 26:35.083
is there any way to close them again?
To… To reset 'em?

26:37.000 --> 26:38.875
Hang on. Hang on.

26:40.375 --> 26:41.875
Someone reset the box.

26:43.208 --> 26:46.833
Someone reset the box.
They sent it to you as a gag.

26:46.916 --> 26:51.416
"Miles is doing a murder mystery.
Let's invite Benoit freaking Blanc."

26:51.500 --> 26:52.625
[laughs]

26:52.708 --> 26:53.791
It's so good.

26:53.875 --> 26:57.208
I am mortified. I don't--

26:57.291 --> 27:01.500
Why? I've got the predefinite detective
in the world at my murder mystery party.

27:01.583 --> 27:03.250
That is so legit.

27:03.333 --> 27:07.166
[sighs] Mr. Bron, I've learned
through bitter experience

27:07.250 --> 27:10.666
that an anonymous invitation
is not to be trifled with.

27:10.750 --> 27:14.125
Okay, look, come on.
I'd love to have you visit me in my home.

27:15.333 --> 27:18.375
There, you've been invited.
You're an official guest now.

27:18.458 --> 27:22.083
Thrilled to have you.
I mean, relax. Enjoy yourself.

27:22.666 --> 27:25.958
Hey, try to solve
the murder mystery if you can.

27:26.041 --> 27:29.333
I don't want to toot my own horn,
but it's pretty next level.

27:29.416 --> 27:30.833
I'm gonna foil. See you at the pool.

27:35.416 --> 27:37.250
[dramatic music playing]

27:52.333 --> 27:55.375
Lionel, you are too sexy
to be a scientist.

27:55.458 --> 27:59.083
And, Claire… you look so cute.

27:59.166 --> 28:00.458
Aw, thanks, Bird.

28:00.541 --> 28:03.333
You really try. I like that.
You really make an effort.

28:03.416 --> 28:05.416
Well, I figured, Greece.

28:06.166 --> 28:08.333
And no masks, I can breathe again.

28:09.083 --> 28:11.500
Look at this pool.
I think I'll go for a swim.

28:12.041 --> 28:13.541
[soaring music plays]

28:17.000 --> 28:18.458
Maybe I'll lay out for a bit.

28:19.333 --> 28:21.458
["Under the Bridge" being played
on guitar]

28:25.208 --> 28:26.791
[Miles] AK and Flea get all the credit,

28:26.875 --> 28:29.666
but Frusciante really
is the heart of the Chili Peppers.

28:29.750 --> 28:32.000
-Hey, Blanc! Have a dip.
-[chuckles] Hey.

28:32.083 --> 28:34.166
Grab a hard kombucha.
They're actually pretty good.

28:34.250 --> 28:36.666
Jared Leto sent 'em over.
I think he wants me to invest.

28:36.750 --> 28:38.916
-Well, I am on vacation, so…
-Hey, booch me!

28:39.000 --> 28:40.083
There you go.

28:40.166 --> 28:41.083
Yeah.

28:41.166 --> 28:42.541
Oh! The Baby Blue!

28:42.625 --> 28:43.541
[Duke] Iconic.

28:43.625 --> 28:46.416
Remember that night you almost pancaked me
with it on the road outside--

28:46.500 --> 28:48.041
Anderson Cooper's birthday.

28:48.125 --> 28:49.458
[both chuckle]

28:49.541 --> 28:51.916
Coop's parties are memorable.

28:53.750 --> 28:56.000
-[male voice over speakers] <i>Dong!</i>
-[Duke] Yep!

28:58.541 --> 28:59.375
[Duke grunts]

28:59.458 --> 29:00.375
[Claire] Oh, God.

29:00.458 --> 29:01.583
[Lionel] Really, Duke?

29:02.750 --> 29:04.333
-[gunshot]
-[Claire] Oh my God!

29:04.416 --> 29:05.291
Really.

29:05.375 --> 29:06.208
Asshole.

29:07.791 --> 29:09.083
[Miles] Now it's a party.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.291
That is quite a piece.

29:13.250 --> 29:14.875
-Never without it.
-Mmm.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.291
-So I see. [chuckles]
-You never know when shit's gonna go down.

29:19.375 --> 29:20.333
Ah…

29:20.416 --> 29:22.291
[suspenseful music playing]

29:28.125 --> 29:30.375
Birdie. You have to tell him.

29:30.458 --> 29:32.083
-You gotta tell him.
-I will.

29:32.166 --> 29:33.708
-I'm serious. You gotta--
-I will.

29:33.791 --> 29:35.166
-I will.
-You just gotta go beg.

29:35.250 --> 29:36.250
-Okay?
-Oh, God.

29:36.333 --> 29:39.000
When he goes to his room,
just follow him and then do it.

29:39.083 --> 29:41.416
I will take care of him. Don't worry.

29:42.875 --> 29:44.958
[Miles] Cool me off. Gimme a sip of that.

29:45.041 --> 29:46.750
-I'm hot for both--
-That's so hot.

29:47.416 --> 29:48.791
[both laugh]

29:51.708 --> 29:53.625
There was a time, you know, back when…

29:55.083 --> 29:57.250
I was the one on magazines. He was nobody.

29:58.208 --> 30:00.458
He couldn't believe
he was even talking to me.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
He said that to me.

30:05.833 --> 30:09.333
"You're Birdie Jay, on billboards.
I can't believe I'm talking to you."

30:11.208 --> 30:13.625
He was this little thing in my hand.

30:13.708 --> 30:14.708
[Whiskey laughs]

30:17.916 --> 30:18.916
I preferred that.

30:29.666 --> 30:33.458
Andi! Hi! Wow.

30:34.208 --> 30:35.333
How long has it been?

30:36.833 --> 30:38.583
Since the trial. So a few months.

30:38.666 --> 30:41.583
Mmm, the trial, ugh. That was not fun.

30:42.583 --> 30:45.791
I mean, for all of us.
For anybody. Right, Peg?

30:46.541 --> 30:49.000
Right? I'm uncomfortable.
I'm gonna go for a swim.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.500
[machine beeps, whirring]

30:53.250 --> 30:56.541
Now, I can handle
the Matisse in the bathroom,

30:56.625 --> 30:59.833
but is, uh… Is that a fax machine?

31:00.458 --> 31:01.333
[Birdie chuckles]

31:01.416 --> 31:03.541
Miles doesn't even have a phone.

31:03.625 --> 31:05.875
It's really convenient. I have one number,

31:05.958 --> 31:08.291
goes to all my fax machines
all over the world.

31:08.375 --> 31:10.625
There's something about analog that's--

31:10.708 --> 31:13.791
Oh! Look at this blast from my past.

31:13.875 --> 31:15.750
-[chuckles]
-Look, everybody. Look.

31:15.833 --> 31:18.166
Miles, you're so funny,
having this around.

31:18.250 --> 31:21.583
[Benoit] May I ask,
if it isn't too presumptuous of me,

31:21.666 --> 31:23.541
what first drew you all together?

31:23.625 --> 31:25.583
You're such an eclectic bunch. [chuckles]

31:25.666 --> 31:29.375
I think disruptors recognize each other.

31:29.458 --> 31:30.291
Yes.

31:30.375 --> 31:33.250
Now you've used
that word before, "disruptors."

31:33.333 --> 31:34.583
What does that mean?

31:34.666 --> 31:36.541
[Miles] Some people think
Birdie's disruptive

31:36.625 --> 31:38.125
every time she opens her mouth.

31:38.208 --> 31:40.958
I mean, just because she says
what everyone's thinking,

31:41.041 --> 31:43.000
but no one's got the nerve to say.

31:43.083 --> 31:44.916
It's true. I say it like I see it.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.166
No. But seriously, you know about
Sweetie Pants, right?

31:48.250 --> 31:50.541
I'm going to embarrass myself here.

31:51.416 --> 31:54.791
I adore Sweetie Pants. I live in mine--

31:54.875 --> 31:58.333
You're sitting next to Birdie Jay.
She was a fashion icon.

31:58.416 --> 32:01.500
And then the youngest editor ever
of <i>She She Magazine.</i> Right?

32:02.416 --> 32:05.541
Establishment BS,
on top of the world, but then…

32:06.208 --> 32:07.791
Well… [sighs]

32:08.333 --> 32:11.291
Then there was the whole thing
with the Halloween costume.

32:11.375 --> 32:12.208
Oh.

32:12.291 --> 32:16.125
[Birdie] It was a tribute to Beyoncé,
but people did not take it that way.

32:16.666 --> 32:18.875
-Anyway, I had a lot of time at home.
-[Benoit] Mm-hmm.

32:18.958 --> 32:21.625
-[Birdie] I just spent all my time in my--
-Oh, in sweatpants.

32:22.208 --> 32:25.708
[Miles] She comes out with designer,
high quality, comfortable sweatpants

32:25.791 --> 32:27.375
just as a pandemic hits.

32:27.958 --> 32:30.583
She disrupted her own disruption.
She made a killing.

32:31.791 --> 32:33.833
And look at Duke.
You think people looked at him

32:33.916 --> 32:35.375
and saw anything other than the beef?

32:35.458 --> 32:39.791
You think they saw the first influencer
to have a million followers on Twitch?

32:39.875 --> 32:42.583
Yes, I did. Here it is.
[grunts] Deal with it.

32:42.666 --> 32:44.125
-Hello.
-[Miles] What about Claire?

32:44.208 --> 32:48.458
You know, soccer mom in beige
throwing grenades into machine politics.

32:48.541 --> 32:52.583
Lionel, he didn't wait ten years
licking on the taint of academia

32:52.666 --> 32:55.291
to get permission to start pushing
the boundaries of science.

32:55.375 --> 32:58.833
He just did it.
That's what I did with Al--

33:01.458 --> 33:04.541
That's what <i>we</i> did with Alpha.
Disrupt. See…

33:08.333 --> 33:10.541
Tell you a little secret.
Your worldview's gonna change.

33:10.625 --> 33:14.083
Once you hear it, you can't unhear it.
Is your phone turned off?

33:14.166 --> 33:16.583
-Oh, I left it in my room.
-[Miles] Okay.

33:18.208 --> 33:22.208
If you want to shake things up,
you start with something small.

33:22.291 --> 33:24.791
You break a norm,
or an idea, or a convention,

33:24.875 --> 33:25.958
some little business model.

33:26.041 --> 33:29.458
But you go with things
that people are kind of tired of anyway.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.666
Everybody gets excited
because you're busting up something

33:32.750 --> 33:34.833
that everyone wanted broken
in the first place.

33:36.083 --> 33:39.000
That's the infraction point.

33:39.083 --> 33:42.625
That's the place
where you have to look within yourself

33:43.416 --> 33:46.666
and ask, "Am I the kind of person
who will keep going?"

33:47.916 --> 33:49.333
Will you break more things?

33:50.291 --> 33:51.958
Break bigger things?

33:52.041 --> 33:56.916
Are you willing to break <i>the</i> thing
that nobody wants you to break?

33:57.875 --> 34:01.750
Because at that point,
people are not gonna be on your side.

34:01.833 --> 34:03.833
They're gonna call you crazy.

34:03.916 --> 34:07.125
They're gonna say you're a bully.
They're gonna tell you to stop.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.416
Even your partner will say,
"You need to stop."

34:12.583 --> 34:13.916
Because as it turns out,

34:14.875 --> 34:18.958
nobody wants you to break
the system itself.

34:20.208 --> 34:23.375
But that is what true disruption is.

34:24.250 --> 34:28.041
And that is what unites all of us.

34:29.291 --> 34:32.750
We all got to that line and crossed it.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.416
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.041
-[Miles] See?
-Yeah, yeah.

34:37.125 --> 34:38.541
So, disruptors.

34:39.708 --> 34:40.708
All of us.

34:42.625 --> 34:44.333

That was some real red-pill stuff, Miles.

She believed it.

34:55.416 --> 34:56.750
Oh, I believed it.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.250
I believed it.

Mr. Blanc, you're a detective, right?

35:02.500 --> 35:03.750
Yes, I'm…

35:09.500 --> 35:10.833
Andi, come on.

35:10.916 --> 35:14.625
Oh, Lionel.
Everybody knows who Lionel works for.

35:14.708 --> 35:15.958
That's no secret.

35:17.208 --> 35:19.708
And we know
who bankrolled Claire's campaign.

35:22.375 --> 35:24.083
But when nobody…

35:24.166 --> 35:26.791
Nobody would touch Birdie
with a ten-foot pole

35:26.875 --> 35:31.291

and compared herself to Harriet Tubman…

in Sweetie Pants? Huh?

35:38.291 --> 35:39.416
And Duke.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.166
When Duke got banned from Twitch

35:41.250 --> 35:43.583
for hawking rhino-horn boner pills
to teenage boys…

35:43.666 --> 35:45.250
There was zero rhino in those pills.

35:45.333 --> 35:47.125
…who set him up at YouTube

35:47.208 --> 35:49.875
and used their media empire
to promote the stream?

I'm a truth-teller.
Some people can't handle it.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.625
It's a dangerous thing

to make to the press about Bangladesh,

37:42.250 --> 37:45.833
and if you make her go through with it,
her name is…

37:47.125 --> 37:48.541
destroyed.

37:49.541 --> 37:53.875
But you see, my resume
is just Birdie Jay, Birdie Jay,

tell me how they achieved the murder,

what was the motive,

there was a prize or something.

Okay, fine.
Yeah, no, the winner gets an iPad.

will we still be able to talk to you?

47:09.500 --> 47:13.000
I don't actually need an iPad.
I'm just saying. It's just…

47:13.083 --> 47:16.583
When you said "win," it…
You know, it made me say it.

47:16.666 --> 47:18.458
Can we, um, work together?

47:19.291 --> 47:21.708
[Miles] Um, only one person
can solve the crime,

47:21.791 --> 47:25.583
so if you got a theory,
keep it close to your chest.

47:25.666 --> 47:28.958
It's designed to be hard.
This will take the whole weekend.

47:29.041 --> 47:30.791
Well, this is truly delightful.

47:32.083 --> 47:34.291
Oh! Have we started already, is it--

47:34.375 --> 47:36.791
-Well, the murder hasn't happened. But…
-Oh, yeah.

47:36.875 --> 47:39.416
Yeah, why not? As Watson said to Holmes--

47:39.500 --> 47:43.458
It was Birdie
who planted a remote device on a crossbow

47:43.541 --> 47:47.541
in revenge for you stealing
her signature Ren Diamond.

47:51.708 --> 47:53.458
Look at the seating arrangement.

47:54.041 --> 47:58.375
It triangulates Birdie
just perfectly with that thing,

47:58.958 --> 48:00.958
which is loaded with a dummy bolt.

48:02.250 --> 48:03.666
Aimed directly…

48:06.416 --> 48:07.541
at Mr. Bron.

48:08.208 --> 48:13.333
Now I believe close inspection will reveal
some sort of remote triggering device,

48:13.416 --> 48:19.500
but more damning,
that is a vintage Jayhawk brand crossbow.

48:20.291 --> 48:22.166
Jayhawk, Birdie Jay.

48:22.833 --> 48:25.875
Of course, there are other superfluous
and rather clumsy clues.

48:25.958 --> 48:28.375
The hedgerow
in the south garden spells letter B.

48:28.458 --> 48:31.833
Birdie's room is the sacral chakra,
which is the one blocked by guilt.

48:31.916 --> 48:35.958
Blah, blah, blah. But the motive, yes,

48:36.041 --> 48:40.000
on the cleverly planted 1998 issue
of <i>The Face</i> magazine

48:40.083 --> 48:41.750
with Birdie on the cover…

48:41.833 --> 48:46.916
[chuckles] …she famously wore
what became known as the Ren Diamond.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
And that's a family heirloom, I believe.

48:49.083 --> 48:53.958
Well, to be clear, I mean, I didn't know
what a "blood diamond" was so--

48:54.041 --> 49:00.083
Mr. Bron, the large pendulous locket
which is… Has not left your neck.

49:00.166 --> 49:04.041
[chuckles] Bit out of keeping
with your breezy island style.

49:04.791 --> 49:06.666
Would you kindly open it for us?

49:12.875 --> 49:13.875
[screams]

49:14.791 --> 49:15.875
My Ren Diamond!

49:15.958 --> 49:20.500
A dramatic, passionate
and colorful crime for a fashionista.

49:20.583 --> 49:21.916
Miss Birdie Jay.

49:22.791 --> 49:28.208
Unfortunately, this crime clashed
with the presence of Benoit Blanc.

49:33.833 --> 49:34.791
[Benoit laughs] Oh!

49:34.875 --> 49:39.500
That… See that? That just went up…
Very good. Very good.

49:41.833 --> 49:48.166
My God, that just felt so good.
So solid, so satisfying!

49:48.250 --> 49:51.625
You know, like one of those
mini-crosswords <i>The Times</i> has

49:51.708 --> 49:56.083
or, you know, I have a chef friend,
and she speaks of trying to create

49:56.166 --> 50:01.833
the perfect bite and that just felt like
the most satisfying bite-sized--

50:08.333 --> 50:09.166
You're angry.

50:11.208 --> 50:15.000
No, Blanc, I'm, uh, just, you know…

50:15.708 --> 50:16.708
What the hell?

50:17.625 --> 50:21.458
That was not
the simplest thing to set up, so…

50:21.541 --> 50:24.208
It's fine. It doesn't matter. It's just…

50:24.291 --> 50:26.666
I hired Gillian Flynn
to write the whole thing--

50:26.750 --> 50:30.583
-Oh, she's quite good.
-She's goddamn expensive, is what she is.

50:31.458 --> 50:35.333
What am I supposed to do now?
Play Yahtzee all weekend? Just… [exhales]

50:37.500 --> 50:42.333
Mr. Bron, truth is,
I… I ruined your game on purpose

50:43.458 --> 50:45.458
and for a very good reason.

50:45.541 --> 50:46.875
I'm sorry, what?

50:48.833 --> 50:51.708
I like the Glass Onion as a metaphor.

50:51.791 --> 50:54.666
An object that seems densely layered,

50:54.750 --> 50:57.583
but in reality
the center is in plain sight.

50:58.166 --> 51:01.708
Your relationship with these people
may seem complex,

51:01.791 --> 51:04.833
but look, what you've done
this weekend is crystal clear.

51:05.958 --> 51:07.416
You've taken seven people,

51:07.500 --> 51:10.791
each of whom has a real-life reason
to wish you harm,

51:10.875 --> 51:13.791
gathered them together on a remote island

51:13.875 --> 51:17.250
and placed the idea
of your murder in their heads.

51:18.583 --> 51:22.375
It's like putting a loaded gun
on the table and turning off the lights!

51:22.458 --> 51:24.166
Oh, whoa. [chuckles]

51:24.250 --> 51:25.375
Come on.

51:26.000 --> 51:30.750
So you play hardball with Lionel,
threaten to destroy his reputation

51:30.833 --> 51:34.500
if he does not play along
and power a manned rocket with Klear.

51:34.583 --> 51:36.250
But now with Claire too…

51:36.333 --> 51:39.083
Now perhaps,
you threaten to support her opponent

51:39.166 --> 51:43.958
in the up-and-coming election
if she does not approve your power plant.

51:44.541 --> 51:46.208
You have done some homework.

51:46.291 --> 51:49.000
And Birdie. Bangladesh.

51:49.083 --> 51:51.958
Sweetie Pants are manufactured there
in a sweatshop.

51:52.041 --> 51:55.458
You're making Birdie take the fall
to cover your ass as the main investor.

51:56.916 --> 52:02.375
And Duke? Well… [chuckles]
…we all know why Duke wants to kill you.

52:02.958 --> 52:04.208
He doesn't know about that.

52:04.791 --> 52:06.208
Yes, he does.

52:07.666 --> 52:10.666
Take my presence as a sign.

52:11.375 --> 52:16.500
For at least one person on this island,
this is not a game.

52:19.208 --> 52:21.833
Oh, this is the famous napkin!

52:21.916 --> 52:23.791
I know this story.

52:24.500 --> 52:26.125
-Right…
-Will you look at that?

52:26.208 --> 52:29.708
I sketched out the original idea
for Alpha on a cocktail napkin

52:29.791 --> 52:32.583
and I showed it to Andi one night
at the Glass Onion.

52:33.583 --> 52:34.791
That was our local bar.

52:36.375 --> 52:40.791
That's where it all began.
But they tore it down the year after that.

52:40.875 --> 52:41.750
[Benoit] Mm-hmm.

52:43.250 --> 52:44.500
[sighs] Andi.

52:45.625 --> 52:46.791
Yes, Andi.

52:48.250 --> 52:49.875
Andi used to tell me the truth.

52:51.041 --> 52:52.458
Nobody does that now.

52:53.750 --> 52:56.166
It's all just fake smiles and agendas

52:56.250 --> 53:00.250
and people wanting
what they think they're owed.

53:00.833 --> 53:06.000
Hating you when you don't give it to them
because that's what you're there for.

53:10.291 --> 53:15.333

for the poor, tortured billionaire. But…

59:10.375 --> 59:12.791
My OGs. I love you. All of you.

59:12.875 --> 59:16.666
[laughs] Disruptors!
Breaking it and making it!

59:16.750 --> 59:18.250
[song continues playing]

59:21.291 --> 59:22.750
[Birdie] Whoo!

59:22.833 --> 59:25.250
Turn up the music.
We're going in the pool tonight!

59:25.333 --> 59:27.833
We're all starting in the pool tonight.
That's what I want.

59:28.416 --> 59:29.250
Miles.

59:29.333 --> 59:31.083
On your feet, genius. I wanna see--

59:31.166 --> 59:32.458
Miles, Duke.

59:33.958 --> 59:35.208
[gasping]

59:36.250 --> 59:37.333
Whoo!

59:38.833 --> 59:40.791
[Duke gasping]

59:40.875 --> 59:41.791
Jesus.

59:41.875 --> 59:43.375
[gasping]

59:48.541 --> 59:50.416
-[screams]
-[gasping]

59:50.500 --> 59:51.958
[dramatic music playing]

59:56.125 --> 59:56.958
[Birdie] Duke!

59:59.541 --> 1:00:01.125
[Claire] What… Is he choking?

1:00:01.208 --> 1:00:03.500
-[Lionel] Yeah, I think he's--
-No, he's not choking.

1:00:05.416 --> 1:00:06.583
-Okay.
-[Lionel] You got him?

1:00:06.666 --> 1:00:08.166
-[Benoit] Yeah.
-[Lionel] Duke.

1:00:09.208 --> 1:00:12.000
You see anything in there?
No, because I feel like he's…

1:00:12.083 --> 1:00:13.541
[grunts, breathes heavily]

1:00:17.250 --> 1:00:18.250
I…

1:00:22.500 --> 1:00:23.416
[shudders]

1:00:28.375 --> 1:00:29.291
What?

1:00:30.666 --> 1:00:34.166
I'm afraid Mr. Cody is… is dead.

1:00:34.250 --> 1:00:36.333
-No, Duke! No!
-[Birdie screams]

1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:43.041
[screams] Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

1:00:43.125 --> 1:00:46.208
What happened?
Did he choke? What happened?

1:00:46.291 --> 1:00:48.916
[Benoit] There was no obstruction
in his airways.

1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.791
But we won't know
the cause of death without an autopsy.

1:00:51.875 --> 1:00:53.166
What just happened?

1:00:54.500 --> 1:00:58.750
My dear, would you do me a favor?
Would you come sit over here?

1:00:58.833 --> 1:01:01.208
Just so I can take care of Mr. Cody.

1:01:01.291 --> 1:01:03.916
Yes, that's right. Mr. Bron, would…

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:07.041
Would you call your boat
and have them come immediately?

1:01:07.125 --> 1:01:09.625
Oh my God. Oh my God.

1:01:09.708 --> 1:01:10.916
Mr. Bron!

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.500
I'll do it. I'll do it.

1:01:16.291 --> 1:01:17.333
How do I do it?

1:01:17.416 --> 1:01:19.833
There's a… There's a radio room,
through there.

1:01:19.916 --> 1:01:22.041
You tell them we need
medical personnel and police.

1:01:22.125 --> 1:01:22.958
[Lionel] Okay, yeah.

1:01:23.041 --> 1:01:26.708
Listen, I must insist
that nobody touch the body

1:01:26.791 --> 1:01:28.666
or disturb anything around it.

1:01:28.750 --> 1:01:29.625
Police?

1:01:31.208 --> 1:01:33.833
Are you treating this
as a crime scene then?

1:01:33.916 --> 1:01:38.125
Oh my God. No, wait, wait, this is bad.
[spluttering] I can't. I…

1:01:38.208 --> 1:01:40.583
The police always come. It's protocol.

1:01:40.666 --> 1:01:42.083
[Claire] I can see the headlines!

1:01:42.166 --> 1:01:46.666
"Governor jets off to Greece in a pandemic
with a men's rights YouTuber who dies!"

1:01:46.750 --> 1:01:48.083
Oh my God. No, I--

1:01:48.166 --> 1:01:49.083
[stomach gurgling]

1:01:50.125 --> 1:01:51.166
Bacardi…

1:01:52.333 --> 1:01:53.291
[retching]

1:01:53.375 --> 1:01:54.416
[crying]

1:01:55.208 --> 1:01:57.750
I think Mr. Blanc's…

1:01:58.375 --> 1:02:01.250
You're not saying
it was done with intention, are you?

1:02:01.333 --> 1:02:02.625
Well, we don't know.

1:02:03.333 --> 1:02:06.750
But Mr. Cody's death was
so acute and violent… yes.

1:02:08.291 --> 1:02:13.333
My guess is something
was put in his drink, intentionally.

1:02:15.500 --> 1:02:17.000
[dramatic music playing]

1:02:19.583 --> 1:02:21.875
What do you mean "morning"?
How's that possible?

1:02:21.958 --> 1:02:24.500
[Andino] <i>Pisceshite! Dock is Pisceshite!</i>

1:02:24.583 --> 1:02:26.791
Piece-of-shite. Piece of…

1:02:29.833 --> 1:02:33.625
Boat can't come till low tide
in the morning. 6:00 a.m. at the earliest.

1:02:33.708 --> 1:02:35.958
Do they understand the situation?

1:02:36.041 --> 1:02:37.666
There is no other landing point,

1:02:37.750 --> 1:02:41.250
and Miles' dumbass Banksy dock
was set to low-tide height

1:02:41.333 --> 1:02:43.708
and it isn't buoyant.
It is a piece of shit.

1:02:43.791 --> 1:02:47.125
Oh, heck. Yeah, all right, all right. Um…

1:02:47.750 --> 1:02:52.291
I suggest you all retire to your rooms,
lock the doors until 5:30,

1:02:53.041 --> 1:02:56.208
when we will convene here
and walk together to the dock.

1:02:56.291 --> 1:02:57.833
I'll stay up all night with the body.

1:02:57.916 --> 1:03:00.791
Make sure it's not tampered with
in any way.

1:03:00.875 --> 1:03:03.541
I recommend that everyone gets some sleep.

1:03:08.416 --> 1:03:10.000
Oh!

1:03:14.166 --> 1:03:16.250
That is…

1:03:16.333 --> 1:03:18.708
[gasps] That's your glass, Miles.

1:03:22.083 --> 1:03:23.291
[Miles] He…

1:03:25.333 --> 1:03:26.750
He picked up mine.

1:03:29.375 --> 1:03:32.333
He picked up mine.

1:03:32.416 --> 1:03:33.333
He…

1:03:35.500 --> 1:03:36.791
Now we could…

1:03:39.875 --> 1:03:40.708
Uh…

1:03:41.333 --> 1:03:43.291
Oh, come on, Miles.

1:03:43.375 --> 1:03:45.125
Miles, it's us!

1:03:45.208 --> 1:03:46.750
Miles, baby, for real?

1:03:47.541 --> 1:03:49.000
I'll pay you one billion dollars

1:03:49.083 --> 1:03:50.833
to tell me
which one of them tried to kill me.

1:03:50.916 --> 1:03:51.958
-Miles!
-Miles!

1:03:52.041 --> 1:03:53.500
-[phone dings]
-[glass shield thuds]

1:03:53.583 --> 1:03:55.541
I'm just going to silence Duke's phone.

1:03:57.666 --> 1:03:59.041
We're staying here in this room.

1:03:59.125 --> 1:04:02.833
I'm keeping you all in plain sight
until that boat arrives.

1:04:02.916 --> 1:04:05.333
-That's what we're doing.
-For God's sakes.

1:04:05.416 --> 1:04:06.250
[scoffs]

1:04:07.208 --> 1:04:10.041
Where's Whiskey? Where's Andi?

1:04:10.125 --> 1:04:11.958
Where's Duke's phone?

1:04:12.041 --> 1:04:14.625
It just dinged. It must be here.

1:04:14.708 --> 1:04:16.041
[Lionel] Yeah, I saw it.

1:04:16.750 --> 1:04:17.750
We just heard it.

1:04:18.375 --> 1:04:19.958
It isn't in any of his pockets.

1:04:20.041 --> 1:04:23.708
Well, he must have dropped it somewhere.
Let's wait for it to ding again.

1:04:23.791 --> 1:04:25.375
Forget about his phone. Look.

1:04:29.708 --> 1:04:31.250
Where is his stupid gun?

1:04:33.083 --> 1:04:37.250
Oh, fiddlesticks.
When did his gun disappear?

1:04:37.333 --> 1:04:38.750
He always has his gun.

1:04:38.833 --> 1:04:42.416
Well, he always has it,
which means we stopped seeing it.

1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:44.583
But at some point this evening,
it was gone.

1:04:45.750 --> 1:04:47.625
-When was that?
-Andi.

1:04:47.708 --> 1:04:49.208
We need to find Andi.

1:04:49.750 --> 1:04:50.583
[Miles] Andi!

1:04:51.208 --> 1:04:52.500
Oh. [sputters]

1:04:52.583 --> 1:04:54.666
-Mr. Bron!
-[male voice over speakers] <i>Dong!</i>

1:04:54.750 --> 1:04:58.500
Oh, it's all right.
It's just that hourly dong thing.

1:04:58.583 --> 1:04:59.708
What?

1:05:01.250 --> 1:05:02.916
-Oh, no. No.
-Miles, calm down!

1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:04.333
Oh, shit. Shit.

1:05:04.416 --> 1:05:06.958
-No. It's happening.
-Mr. Bron. What is the matter?

1:05:07.041 --> 1:05:10.750
It was the game. The game! My murder game.
We were gonna be having drinks,

1:05:10.833 --> 1:05:13.166
and I thought it'd be fun
to say something dramatic at 10:00.

1:05:13.250 --> 1:05:15.625
We were gonna have
20 minutes where… [gasps]

1:05:15.708 --> 1:05:19.041
Blanc, you have to help me.
You have to help me. Help me! Help me!

1:05:19.916 --> 1:05:21.625
What happens at ten o'clock?

1:05:23.083 --> 1:05:24.750
[systems powering down]

1:05:28.916 --> 1:05:31.041
[Birdie screaming]

1:05:31.916 --> 1:05:34.125
-[Peg] Birdie, listen to my voice.
-[Birdie] Oh my God.

1:05:34.208 --> 1:05:35.625
-Is that you?
-[Peg] Stop screaming.

1:05:35.708 --> 1:05:37.958
-[Birdie] Something touched me!
-[Benoit] Do not panic!

1:05:38.041 --> 1:05:39.583
-[Birdie] It's so dark.
-[Peg] I'm here.

1:05:39.666 --> 1:05:42.125
-Where's my phone? It has a flashlight.
-[Birdie] I can't see.

1:05:42.208 --> 1:05:43.916
-[Benoit] How does this--
-[Claire] Lionel!

1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:45.333
-[Lionel] Claire?
-Everybody…

1:05:45.416 --> 1:05:46.583
-[Lionel] Over here!
-I'm here!

1:05:46.666 --> 1:05:49.583
Stand still. Calm down. Do not panic.

1:05:49.666 --> 1:05:53.250
It was Andi! [panting] It was Andi.

1:05:53.333 --> 1:05:57.166
She killed Duke,
and she tore our room apart. I saw her!

1:05:57.250 --> 1:05:58.916
-What?!
-[Claire] Is that a speargun?

1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:01.666
No. Not today!

1:06:01.750 --> 1:06:03.458
[Birdie] Wait, wait, wait.

1:06:03.541 --> 1:06:05.833
-[Benoit] Mr. Bron!
-[Claire] What the hell is happening?

1:06:05.916 --> 1:06:08.541
Oh, hell's bells!
Just, everybody, just stay here!

1:06:11.500 --> 1:06:12.333
[gasps]

1:06:21.291 --> 1:06:22.625
[footsteps]

1:06:24.500 --> 1:06:26.791
[Peg] Aha! Here's my phone!

1:06:28.833 --> 1:06:32.958
Birdie? Lionel? Guys?

1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:38.000
Andi?

1:06:44.666 --> 1:06:45.666
[Benoit] Andi!

1:06:47.666 --> 1:06:49.458
[panting]

1:06:52.208 --> 1:06:53.458
[footsteps running]

1:06:54.208 --> 1:06:55.625
Who's that?

1:07:03.250 --> 1:07:04.666
Oh, Lord help us.

1:07:09.250 --> 1:07:10.416
[footsteps approaching]

1:07:12.750 --> 1:07:13.583
Helen.

1:07:13.666 --> 1:07:14.541
-[grunts]
-[panting]

1:07:14.625 --> 1:07:16.750
Now listen, did you take Duke's gun?

1:07:16.833 --> 1:07:18.916
Why would I take Duke's gun?
Why are the lights out?

1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:20.333
-Duke is dead.
-What?

1:07:37.291 --> 1:07:38.291
I don't understand.

1:07:38.375 --> 1:07:42.000
Please. Trust me. It's all in plain sight.

1:07:43.875 --> 1:07:46.833
We only need one last piece
of information, but only you can--

1:07:46.916 --> 1:07:47.916
[gunshot]

1:07:55.875 --> 1:07:57.000
[glass shield thuds]

1:07:58.416 --> 1:07:59.791
[Claire] Lionel? Lionel?

1:07:59.875 --> 1:08:02.666
[Peg] Guys? Where are you?

1:08:02.750 --> 1:08:04.375
[Miles] I'm here! What happened?

1:08:04.458 --> 1:08:06.333
-[Claire] Did you hear that?
-[Miles] Guys?

1:08:06.416 --> 1:08:08.541
[Lionel] I heard it from here.
Everybody all right?

1:08:08.625 --> 1:08:09.541
[Miles] What was that?

1:08:09.625 --> 1:08:12.958
[Peg] Was that a gunshot?
It sounded like a gunshot.

1:08:17.958 --> 1:08:19.375
[systems powering up]

1:08:31.041 --> 1:08:31.875
[knife clatters]

1:08:47.708 --> 1:08:48.916
Oh, God.

1:08:50.375 --> 1:08:53.458
[screams, whimpers]

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:01.333
[gasps]

1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:03.791
[Benoit] Everyone. Inside.

1:09:03.875 --> 1:09:06.083
-Shouldn't we--
-She's not going anywhere.

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:11.500
It's time to finish this.

1:09:15.791 --> 1:09:19.333
Peg, radio the mainland.
Tell them to send the boats now.

1:09:19.416 --> 1:09:22.416
Banksy be damned!
Beach them if they have to!

1:09:24.416 --> 1:09:27.250
-She killed Duke. Why would she--
-No.

1:09:29.125 --> 1:09:30.500
It makes no sense.

1:09:30.583 --> 1:09:31.958
It all makes perfect sense.

1:09:32.041 --> 1:09:34.625
Duke, Andi, this weekend,

1:09:34.708 --> 1:09:38.458
this ridiculous game that started
well before we set foot on this island.

1:09:38.541 --> 1:09:41.708
Will you explain it to us then, detective?

1:09:41.791 --> 1:09:45.208
No, I can peel back the layers,

1:09:45.291 --> 1:09:49.750
I can take it to a point,
but what lies at the center,

1:09:51.416 --> 1:09:55.458
only one person can tell us
who killed Cassandra Brand.

1:09:56.625 --> 1:09:58.625
[gentle piano music playing]

1:10:01.958 --> 1:10:02.875
[knock on door]

1:10:07.750 --> 1:10:08.916
[Benoit] Get that, would ya?

1:10:09.708 --> 1:10:12.375
[Phillip] You're not in the bath again,
are you?

1:10:12.458 --> 1:10:13.708
[Benoit hesitates] No!

1:10:14.416 --> 1:10:15.458
[door unlocking]

1:10:18.458 --> 1:10:19.416
Yep?

1:10:20.958 --> 1:10:21.791
Uh…

1:10:23.291 --> 1:10:24.375
Can I help you?

1:10:24.458 --> 1:10:27.541
[in Southern accent]
Yes, is this Benoit Blanc's residence?

1:10:28.458 --> 1:10:29.875
Um, what is this regarding?

1:10:29.958 --> 1:10:34.250
Well, his office was closed,
and I really need to speak with him.

1:10:34.333 --> 1:10:36.416
It's urgent. Please.

1:10:38.208 --> 1:10:40.833
Blanc! There's someone here for you.

1:10:42.583 --> 1:10:43.583
With a box!

1:10:47.500 --> 1:10:49.166
[Benoit chuckles] Oh my.

1:10:49.250 --> 1:10:52.625
Well, why don't we start at the beginning?

1:10:54.750 --> 1:10:58.208
My name is Helen Brand,
and I came all the way here from Alabama.

1:10:59.791 --> 1:11:02.458
Well, what do you do in Alabama?

1:11:03.041 --> 1:11:06.333
I teach. Third grade. Do a lot of Zooming.

1:11:07.291 --> 1:11:10.500
We've been getting into tie-dying a lot
and all this pandemic stuff.

1:11:12.458 --> 1:11:14.416
Okay, none of that really matters.

1:11:14.500 --> 1:11:17.625
Mr. Blanc, two days ago,
I received a call.

1:11:17.708 --> 1:11:19.833
My twin sister committed suicide.

1:11:22.208 --> 1:11:23.458
<i>In her car.</i>

1:11:26.333 --> 1:11:27.583
<i>In her garage.</i>

1:11:30.500 --> 1:11:31.750
<i>With the engine running.</i>

1:11:35.708 --> 1:11:39.541
My sister was Cassandra Brand.
Do you know who she was?

1:11:39.625 --> 1:11:45.333
Yes, of course. I'm sorry, you…
I thought you looked familiar. [chuckles]

1:11:46.458 --> 1:11:48.500
Impressive woman, your sister.

1:11:49.958 --> 1:11:52.833
You know, she kept a journal
every day of her life

1:11:52.916 --> 1:11:54.625
since she was six years old.

1:11:55.250 --> 1:11:56.666
You know what she called it?

1:11:57.416 --> 1:12:02.291
"Notes For Future Biographers."
Biographers. Plural.

1:12:02.375 --> 1:12:04.791
-The girl was six years old.
-[chuckles]

1:12:04.875 --> 1:12:07.333
Then the day after high school,
she shot off to New York,

1:12:07.416 --> 1:12:08.708
and she just never looked back.

1:12:08.791 --> 1:12:10.791
[laughs] You know, when we were kids,

1:12:10.875 --> 1:12:13.791
we goofed together,
and we'd do this character, Rich Bitch.

1:12:15.416 --> 1:12:18.375
"Heavens, the dog ate the caviar again."

1:12:19.125 --> 1:12:20.083
[chuckles]

1:12:20.166 --> 1:12:22.916
Then I hear her doing a talk,
and that's exactly how she sounded.

1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:26.083
Rich Bitch! And I'm like,
"Who are you fooling, girl? Not me!"

1:12:27.250 --> 1:12:29.416
She had the guts and brains
for both of us,

1:12:29.500 --> 1:12:31.625
and I was just happy watching her,
you know?

1:12:32.291 --> 1:12:35.416
So you, um… You get the call…

1:12:35.500 --> 1:12:38.916
Yeah, yeah. I get the call and I fly in.
This was yesterday.

1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:42.958
And then I go to Andi's house.
I'm cleaning it out. It's a mess.

1:12:43.041 --> 1:12:44.708
All of her books everywhere.

1:12:44.791 --> 1:12:47.875
And I'm just thinking about
what was taken from my sister,

1:12:47.958 --> 1:12:49.875
how I wasn't there for her.

1:12:49.958 --> 1:12:53.625
And I'm getting angrier and angrier,
and then I just hear a knock at the door,

1:12:53.708 --> 1:12:57.041
and it's some courier
with this thing from Miles Bron.

1:12:57.583 --> 1:12:59.958
And I'm sure there's
some clever way to open it.

1:13:00.041 --> 1:13:02.000
I don't know. I just open it.

1:13:02.083 --> 1:13:03.458
And it's an invitation

1:13:03.958 --> 1:13:06.791
to his private island in Greece
for next weekend.

1:13:06.875 --> 1:13:10.833
One of those little trips she'd go on
with him and his group of shitheads.

1:13:10.916 --> 1:13:13.708
They like to call themselves
"The Disruptors."

1:13:14.375 --> 1:13:19.083
But I knew who they were,
and I told her who they were. Shitheads.

1:13:21.416 --> 1:13:22.333
[sighs]

1:13:22.416 --> 1:13:26.208
Miss Brand, what can I do for you?

1:13:27.333 --> 1:13:29.750
Andi didn't commit suicide.

1:13:29.833 --> 1:13:30.916
[dramatic music plays]

1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.791
[Helen] She didn't leave any note.

1:13:32.875 --> 1:13:35.875
So I went on her computer,
and I looked in her email,

1:13:35.958 --> 1:13:38.541
her sent messages,
to see if she wrote anybody anything.

1:13:38.625 --> 1:13:44.166
And look. She sent this at 4:00 p.m.,
the day she was murdered, four days ago.

1:13:45.166 --> 1:13:46.666
"I finally found it."

1:13:46.750 --> 1:13:51.083
"It's right here, and I'm going to use it
to burn his whole empire down."

1:13:51.166 --> 1:13:53.875
"I'm giving you all one last chance
to make things right."

1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:56.958
"You know where to find me. A."

1:13:58.958 --> 1:14:01.958
And I'm assuming
all of these names here are--

1:14:02.041 --> 1:14:05.916
Birdie Jay, Duke Cody,
Claire Debella and Lionel Toussaint.

1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:07.125
The Shitheads.

1:14:07.625 --> 1:14:10.541
She sends that email,
nobody writes back anything,

1:14:10.625 --> 1:14:13.333
and then the next day,
she's dead in the garage

1:14:13.416 --> 1:14:15.125
with sleeping pills in her system?

1:14:16.416 --> 1:14:19.458
I searched every inch
of every room in her house,

1:14:19.541 --> 1:14:21.291
and guess what wasn't there?

1:14:23.916 --> 1:14:24.958
The red envelope.

1:14:27.916 --> 1:14:28.916
Compelling.

1:14:29.750 --> 1:14:32.625
Google said you are
the world's greatest detective.

1:14:32.708 --> 1:14:34.583
Somebody like me,
takes something like this

1:14:34.666 --> 1:14:37.666
about a group of rich folk
with an army full of lawyers--

1:14:37.750 --> 1:14:39.583
But if one was to get 'em alone,

1:14:40.791 --> 1:14:44.666
isolated for a weekend with,
in your words,

1:14:44.750 --> 1:14:47.000
the world's greatest detective…

1:14:49.458 --> 1:14:51.375
You wanna hire me to go to that island.

1:14:51.458 --> 1:14:53.041
It's a stupid idea, right?

1:14:53.125 --> 1:14:55.166
Listen, I want to be clear, huh?

1:14:55.916 --> 1:14:57.291
I am not Batman.

1:14:57.375 --> 1:14:59.875
I can find you the truth,
I can gather evidence,

1:14:59.958 --> 1:15:03.291
I can present it to the police
and the courts, but… [scoffs]

1:15:03.375 --> 1:15:05.416
…that is where my jurisdiction ends.

1:15:05.500 --> 1:15:09.166
Yeah, but it's you doing it instead of me.
I'll take those odds.

1:15:09.250 --> 1:15:11.791
I've not seen
your sister's death in the news.

1:15:11.875 --> 1:15:14.250
-Did you release a statement?
-[Helen] No.

1:15:14.333 --> 1:15:15.833
Shit. Was I supposed to?

1:15:16.875 --> 1:15:18.291
I don't know how this works.

1:15:18.375 --> 1:15:21.833
And you have no other family member
who was informed of the death and…

1:15:22.666 --> 1:15:25.250
Oh, if I pulled a few strings,

1:15:25.333 --> 1:15:29.000
I could keep it from leaking
to the press for another… week?

1:15:29.083 --> 1:15:30.583
Maybe, that's…

1:15:31.833 --> 1:15:32.666
Oh.

1:15:33.791 --> 1:15:35.875
No, that's outrageous. That wouldn't…

1:15:38.041 --> 1:15:39.041
Well, now…

1:15:40.250 --> 1:15:44.000
Wow. No, that… Yes. Miss Brand.

1:15:46.083 --> 1:15:50.041
Any feelings of reverence or respect
that you had for me

1:15:50.125 --> 1:15:53.666
when you crossed my threshold,
buttress those feelings now.

1:15:53.750 --> 1:15:54.625
Buttress them.

1:15:56.291 --> 1:16:02.083
I am proposing
that you come with me to that island

1:16:03.166 --> 1:16:04.333
as your sister.

1:16:05.416 --> 1:16:07.125
As Cassandra Brand.

1:16:08.166 --> 1:16:12.458
What? No.
No, no, no, I'm hiring you to go.

1:16:13.416 --> 1:16:15.958
I… I'm not… Are you insane?

1:16:16.041 --> 1:16:17.666
Buttress now. Yes.

1:16:17.750 --> 1:16:19.583
A famous detective shows up

1:16:19.666 --> 1:16:23.083
and out of the blue,
starts poking the subject of your sister,

1:16:23.166 --> 1:16:24.833
they'll shut up like a clam.

1:16:25.875 --> 1:16:30.541
Your presence on that island
is the essential catalyst.

1:16:30.625 --> 1:16:32.625
-Oh, no, come on, man.
-Buttress.

1:16:32.708 --> 1:16:36.000
Yeah, I'm trying real hard to buttress,
but this sounds nuts.

1:16:36.083 --> 1:16:38.250
But it is the only way that this works.

1:16:38.333 --> 1:16:41.750
Look at me.
They'll know instantly that I'm not her.

1:16:41.833 --> 1:16:44.083
You'll cut your hair.
You'll wear her clothes.

1:16:44.166 --> 1:16:46.416
Oh, you really think
I can fit into that shit?

1:16:46.500 --> 1:16:49.041
-And what about my hair?
-I know a guy.

1:16:49.125 --> 1:16:51.333
Now, why would anyone suspect

1:16:51.416 --> 1:16:55.625
you showing up, playing your sister,
when they don't know your sister is dead?

1:16:58.791 --> 1:16:59.666
[Helen] Right.

1:17:00.250 --> 1:17:01.916
They don't know Andi is dead.

1:17:03.541 --> 1:17:05.333
So why would they suspect anything?

1:17:07.208 --> 1:17:11.375
-And you'll do the inspecting?
-Yes, I will. You just have to be there.

1:17:13.083 --> 1:17:16.958
Mr. Blanc, is… Is this safe?

1:17:19.166 --> 1:17:20.083
No. No.

1:17:21.166 --> 1:17:23.625
One person will know the truth about you.

1:17:24.375 --> 1:17:26.083
From the moment you arrive on that island,

1:17:26.166 --> 1:17:28.916
the killer will know who you are
and what you are doing.

1:17:29.416 --> 1:17:32.458
And they certainly wouldn't hesitate
to kill again if it covers their tracks.

1:17:32.541 --> 1:17:36.708
I'm… I'm a detective, Helen.
I'm not a bodyguard.

1:17:37.541 --> 1:17:40.041
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

1:17:41.291 --> 1:17:42.250
No.

1:17:44.583 --> 1:17:48.125
One of those shitheads killed my sister.

1:17:53.458 --> 1:17:56.166
Do you really think
we can get the son of a bitch?

1:17:56.250 --> 1:17:57.750
[suspenseful music playing]

1:18:00.541 --> 1:18:02.083
[music continues]

1:18:24.541 --> 1:18:25.750
Well, my goodness.

1:18:25.833 --> 1:18:30.750
I shouldn't be here. This is nuts.
But I'm here. So let's do this.

1:18:31.791 --> 1:18:34.000
-Drink?
-You need a drink.

1:18:34.083 --> 1:18:36.000
Oh, no, I don't drink.
I'll have some coffee.

1:18:36.083 --> 1:18:37.041
[waiter] All right.

1:18:37.541 --> 1:18:38.500
Andi's journals.

1:18:38.583 --> 1:18:42.375
Good, you keep studying them.
Okay, so… Tomorrow.

1:18:42.958 --> 1:18:44.125
I'll get there early.

1:18:44.208 --> 1:18:47.541
Really lay on some Southern hokum,
get them all off guard.

1:18:47.625 --> 1:18:50.166
On the boat… be cold.

1:18:50.250 --> 1:18:51.458
Don't engage in conversation.

1:18:51.541 --> 1:18:53.583
-Okay, I'm not great on boats.
-Oh, you'll be fine.

1:18:53.666 --> 1:18:57.083
Just remember, Rich Bitch voice.
Andi posture.

1:18:58.208 --> 1:19:00.666
I have all of her TED Talks on this,
and I've been studying 'em.

1:19:00.750 --> 1:19:01.916
Good.

1:19:03.041 --> 1:19:05.958
-[in stately tone] The dog ate the caviar.
-There you go.

1:19:06.541 --> 1:19:07.375
Yeah.

1:19:07.458 --> 1:19:08.958
[in Southern accent] So, you said

1:19:09.041 --> 1:19:11.041
you were gonna be researching
these folks for motive.

1:19:11.125 --> 1:19:12.333
Did you find anything?

1:19:12.416 --> 1:19:13.625
Yes, I did.

1:19:13.708 --> 1:19:17.166
But motives for each of them
to want Miles Bron dead.

1:19:17.250 --> 1:19:20.083
Now why would they
kill her to protect him?

1:19:20.166 --> 1:19:21.375
I just don't get it.

1:19:21.458 --> 1:19:24.166
What about Miles? What if he just did it?

1:19:24.250 --> 1:19:28.375
Well, we can't rule it out,
but Miles Bron is not an idiot.

1:19:29.125 --> 1:19:32.375
To risk committing murder
after a very public court case,

1:19:32.458 --> 1:19:35.083
with the possibility
of that email of Andi's coming to light,

1:19:35.166 --> 1:19:37.916
would be an exceedingly
stupid thing to do.

1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:40.291
Especially if someone
was willing to do it for him.

1:19:40.375 --> 1:19:42.416
Come on. Walk me through these journals.

1:19:43.083 --> 1:19:44.000
Okay.

1:19:44.541 --> 1:19:47.208
About ten years ago,
before they all hit it big,

1:19:47.291 --> 1:19:48.833
<i>they used to hang together at this bar.</i>

1:19:48.916 --> 1:19:50.875
[Benoit] <i>And Miles was leader of the pack?</i>

1:19:50.958 --> 1:19:52.166
[Helen] <i>No. Andi was.</i>

1:19:52.250 --> 1:19:54.250
<i>They were all friends with Andi.</i>

1:19:54.833 --> 1:19:56.625
<i>Birdie was a washed-up model.</i>

1:19:56.708 --> 1:20:00.000
<i>Duke was a nerd</i>
<i>doing video game tournaments.</i>

1:20:00.083 --> 1:20:02.166
<i>Claire just lost a race for city council.</i>

1:20:02.250 --> 1:20:04.291
<i>Lionel was a substitute teacher.</i>

1:20:04.375 --> 1:20:06.541
<i>All of them run aground in their thirties.</i>

1:20:06.625 --> 1:20:09.500
<i>But Andi saw their potentials.</i>
<i>She found them all.</i>

1:20:09.583 --> 1:20:10.583
-Hi!
-Hey!

1:20:10.666 --> 1:20:13.333
[Helen] <i>Then she found Miles.</i>
<i>Introduced him to the group.</i>

1:20:13.416 --> 1:20:14.958
This is Miles.

1:20:15.041 --> 1:20:16.708
-Hey, nice to meet you.
-Hey, bro.

1:20:16.791 --> 1:20:17.833
[Claire] I love your hair.

1:20:17.916 --> 1:20:19.666
[Helen] <i>At first, nobody liked him.</i>

1:20:19.750 --> 1:20:20.916
[Miles] …outlive the person…

1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:22.125
[Helen] <i>He'd say stuff like…</i>

1:20:22.208 --> 1:20:24.458
I want to be responsible for something

1:20:24.541 --> 1:20:28.291
that gets talked about in the same breath
as the <i>Mona Lisa.</i> Forever.

1:20:28.375 --> 1:20:30.708
What does that even mean?

1:20:30.791 --> 1:20:32.291
It just means immortality.

1:20:32.375 --> 1:20:35.125
He wants to create something
that feels lasting, that feels--

1:20:35.208 --> 1:20:37.791
His first venture was Moviefone
for foot massages.

1:20:37.875 --> 1:20:39.666
-Did it work?
-[Lionel] No!

1:20:39.750 --> 1:20:41.583
Okay, listen, let's just roll with it.

1:20:41.666 --> 1:20:44.333
Let's humor him. Let's see where it goes.
Let's see what happens.

1:20:44.416 --> 1:20:46.875
-Hey, team.
<i>-</i>[Helen] <i>And things started happening.</i>

1:20:46.958 --> 1:20:48.625
[screams]

1:20:48.708 --> 1:20:51.666
[Helen] <i>He got Birdie a show</i>
<i>for her designs. It did well.</i>

1:20:51.750 --> 1:20:55.041
<i>Got Lionel published.</i>
<i>Duke set up at Twitch.</i>

1:20:55.125 --> 1:20:56.750
<i>Claire elected locally.</i>

1:20:56.833 --> 1:20:58.250
…at you. I love you back!

1:20:58.333 --> 1:21:01.000
[Helen] <i>You know, small stuff,</i>
<i>but it happened.</i>

1:21:02.375 --> 1:21:04.375
<i>And then the big thing happened.</i>

1:21:05.958 --> 1:21:07.250
What is that you're working on?

1:21:15.500 --> 1:21:18.916
So based on the napkin idea,
Andi and Miles created Alpha.

1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.375
It blows up.
They bring everyone along for the ride.

1:21:22.375 --> 1:21:24.625
Miles' aspirations
keep getting bigger and bigger.

1:21:24.708 --> 1:21:25.916
Cut to two years ago,

1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:28.166
Miles meets
some sketchy Norwegian scientist

1:21:28.250 --> 1:21:30.583
at an ayahuasca ceremony in Peru

1:21:30.666 --> 1:21:33.166
who sells him
on this whole new hydrogen fuel.

1:21:33.250 --> 1:21:36.541
-Hmm.
-He becomes obsessed.

1:21:36.625 --> 1:21:40.583
And he's willing to give the company's
entire resources to launch this thing.

1:21:42.041 --> 1:21:43.041
No.

1:21:43.125 --> 1:21:46.666
Andi. Andi, come on. This is it!

1:21:46.750 --> 1:21:50.583
No, no, no. This is not a start-up.
This could blow up the world.

1:21:50.666 --> 1:21:51.500
Yeah.

1:21:51.583 --> 1:21:54.416
No! Literally, Miles.
This could blow up the world!

1:21:54.500 --> 1:21:55.333
[sighs]

1:21:55.416 --> 1:22:00.583
The reality-distortion field ends here.
I can't let you do this.

1:22:01.458 --> 1:22:04.208
What… What do you mean you can't let me?

1:22:04.791 --> 1:22:05.750
I'll walk.

1:22:06.333 --> 1:22:09.750
And I'll take half the company
to stop you from using it for this.

1:22:09.833 --> 1:22:13.166
And she did it.
And, God, I love that she did it.

1:22:13.916 --> 1:22:16.750
Then she found out Miles
had the lawyers work the contract

1:22:16.833 --> 1:22:18.541
so she was cut out the company completely.

1:22:18.625 --> 1:22:20.375
So she sued over that?

1:22:20.458 --> 1:22:21.833
Her whole case was based on

1:22:21.916 --> 1:22:25.250
intellectual ownership
of the company's founding idea.

1:22:25.833 --> 1:22:27.250
Her idea on the napkin.

1:22:28.083 --> 1:22:29.750
Which she didn't keep.

1:22:29.833 --> 1:22:33.666
Miles was very excited. He had an idea.

1:22:33.750 --> 1:22:35.625
Uh, so he grabbed a napkin,

1:22:35.708 --> 1:22:40.208
and he, uh, he scribbled
something on it to show us.

1:22:40.291 --> 1:22:44.166
-That's a lie! Your Honor, it's a lie.
-[judge] Order! Counsel, get your client--

1:22:44.250 --> 1:22:46.958
[Andi] Look me in the eye, Claire!
You know it's a lie!

It's a lie.

[camera shutters clicking]

1:22:49.958 --> 1:22:53.666
[lawyer] And do you recall, Mr. Cody,
who wrote this napkin?

1:22:53.750 --> 1:22:54.833
Yeah, Miles.

1:22:55.541 --> 1:22:57.583
Uh, it was Miles.

1:22:59.208 --> 1:23:00.083
Miles.

[Benoit] <i>A bald-faced fabrication.</i>

1:23:15.125 --> 1:23:19.083

1:23:22.041 --> 1:23:23.125

1:23:54.708 --> 1:23:59.333
So… every one of The Disruptors
perjured themselves

1:23:59.416 --> 1:24:02.375
to destroy Andi and shield Miles Bron.

1:24:02.458 --> 1:24:06.666
We… You and I,
we need to find out why. Motive.

1:24:06.750 --> 1:24:10.458
Whose was strong enough
to go one step further and commit murder?

1:24:10.541 --> 1:24:12.250
And then, this will be tricky,

1:24:12.333 --> 1:24:15.625
everyone's whereabouts
on the night of her death.

1:24:15.708 --> 1:24:19.666
Who could have been
at Andi's house that night? Opportunity.

1:24:20.625 --> 1:24:24.083
-Our suspects, motive, opportunity… Hey!
-Mm-hmm.

1:24:25.041 --> 1:24:27.500
-This kinda looks like that <i>Clue</i> notepad.
-Yes, yes, yes.

1:24:27.583 --> 1:24:29.125
You must be really great at <i>Clue,</i> huh?

1:24:29.208 --> 1:24:32.458
I'm very bad at dumb things.
My Achilles' heel.

Ticking boxes, running around,

Duke and Birdie, I think they're onto me.
Or they were just being assholes.

1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:42.583
Well, that's not mutually exclusive.

1:25:42.666 --> 1:25:45.041
Now, look, I suspect,
when we're all settling in,

1:25:45.125 --> 1:25:47.916
Bron's going to pull me aside
to explain my presence.

1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:49.958
That is your chance to snoop.

Yes.

-I am.

-Do you want to walk?
-Sure.

Do you want this? I'm not into it.
It smells like that guy Derol.

That's a beautiful necklace.
You're a Taurus?

1:26:35.041 --> 1:26:37.333

He, um, surprised me for my birthday.

1:26:42.041 --> 1:26:44.750
He filled his entire
penthouse apartment with roses.

1:26:44.833 --> 1:26:45.958
It was very cute.

1:26:47.375 --> 1:26:50.458
He's a really good guy. He's complicated.

1:26:51.750 --> 1:26:52.875
But…

1:26:54.500 --> 1:26:57.000
I think it's really shitty
what they all did to you.

1:26:57.875 --> 1:26:59.333
And how they all treated you.

1:26:59.416 --> 1:27:01.875
I read your court transcripts,
and you got shanked.

1:27:04.625 --> 1:27:06.041
Thanks, Whiskey.

1:27:06.125 --> 1:27:08.083
Yeah, this is my second one
of these things.

it's kind of the worst.

Duke just treats me like arm candy,
and they just ignore me.

-Why do you put up with it?
-With Duke?

1:27:23.958 --> 1:27:28.208
I'm building my brand, and he's putting me
on his channel more often.

1:27:29.375 --> 1:27:32.750
Though, he's leaning harder right
into this mandom stuff.

If I'm going to go

I don't think
that's a road I wanna go down.

turn people's homes into the Hindenburg?

I was the one on magazines. He was nobody.

[Claire] <i>Lionel and I got there</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

1:32:40.208 --> 1:32:41.458
<i>Duke was already there.</i>

1:32:41.541 --> 1:32:43.250
-[Duke] Andi!
-[Lionel] Hey, Andi?

1:32:43.333 --> 1:32:44.375
[Duke] <i>The lights were out.</i>

1:32:44.458 --> 1:32:46.458
<i>I was pounding so hard,</i>
<i>I almost broke it down.</i>

1:32:46.541 --> 1:32:47.375
Andi!

1:32:49.291 --> 1:32:52.166
We knocked, waited, and called for you,
but after an hour, we left.

1:32:52.250 --> 1:32:55.041
Birdie came back later on to check.
It was the same thing.

1:32:55.125 --> 1:32:58.125
-Where the hell were you, Andi?
-What time did you get there?

1:32:58.708 --> 1:33:00.166
I don't know. It was dark.

1:33:01.666 --> 1:33:02.500
And, Duke,

1:33:03.708 --> 1:33:05.166
you were already there?

1:33:05.250 --> 1:33:07.333
He almost got in an accident
on his motorcycle,

1:33:07.416 --> 1:33:08.541
he was driving so fast.

1:33:08.625 --> 1:33:09.875
Andi, I almost got pancaked.

1:33:09.958 --> 1:33:13.208
Okay, okay. Can you say all that
one more time for me, please?

1:33:14.750 --> 1:33:15.583
[sighs]

1:33:17.125 --> 1:33:17.958
Look.

1:33:19.291 --> 1:33:22.083
I don't know what you're planning
on pulling being here,

1:33:22.750 --> 1:33:24.500
but we need to talk about this.

1:33:25.583 --> 1:33:27.750
If I would've answered
the door that night,

1:33:28.875 --> 1:33:32.333
would you have said,
"I'm sorry. I back you with Miles."

1:33:33.666 --> 1:33:35.625
Or were you just showing up

1:33:35.708 --> 1:33:38.250
so you could stop me
from using that envelope?

1:33:53.083 --> 1:33:54.208
Something's off.

1:33:55.041 --> 1:33:56.166
I don't like it.

1:33:57.208 --> 1:33:58.583
What's she playing at?

1:34:01.500 --> 1:34:02.500

[automated voice]
<i>Please, keep our water clean.</i>

1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:11.583
That's everything she said, I think.

1:34:11.666 --> 1:34:14.875
I think maybe you should take up drinking.
You're just killing it.

1:34:14.958 --> 1:34:20.250
Lionel and Claire were never there alone.
But Duke came early and Birdie came late.

1:34:20.333 --> 1:34:22.791
But they could've gotten there early,
killed your sister,

1:34:22.875 --> 1:34:25.916
circled away and then waited
for the other to arrive.

1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:28.166
Shit.

1:34:28.250 --> 1:34:30.583
Something is just teasing the edge
of my brain.

1:34:30.666 --> 1:34:33.791
This… this case confounds me.
It just confounds me.

1:34:33.875 --> 1:34:37.333
We don't have a motive
for Duke or Birdie, so--

1:34:37.416 --> 1:34:39.958

1:34:40.750 --> 1:34:41.750

No, not right now.

1:34:46.791 --> 1:34:48.125
[fax machine whirring]

1:34:49.541 --> 1:34:50.541
Maybe later.

1:34:50.625 --> 1:34:52.500
<i>All right. It's your money, not mine.</i>

1:34:57.250 --> 1:35:03.333
Ugh. Oh, if I ever meet Jared Leto,
I'm gonna whoop his kombucha-brewing ass.

1:35:03.416 --> 1:35:06.041
One number. All his machines.

1:35:09.458 --> 1:35:10.625
[Helen] Holy shit.

1:35:10.708 --> 1:35:14.375
From that afternoon,
just minutes after Andi sent the email.

1:35:15.041 --> 1:35:16.875
Lionel. Lionel faxed it--

1:35:16.958 --> 1:35:19.666
Now hold on,
it doesn't necessarily mean he… Get down.

1:35:20.291 --> 1:35:22.958
Right now. Go to him.
Do what you gotta do,

1:35:23.041 --> 1:35:26.125
push that son of a bitch.
Just get an answer out of him.

1:35:26.208 --> 1:35:31.750
Look, babe. We really need this.
So do this for me one last time, okay?

1:35:33.333 --> 1:35:35.583
-All right. I love--

1:35:54.666 --> 1:35:55.583
[Miles] Come here.

1:35:58.000 --> 1:35:58.833
[rustling]

1:36:09.125 --> 1:36:10.500
Are you gonna do it for me?

1:36:10.583 --> 1:36:12.250
[Miles] Mm-hmm.

1:36:13.500 --> 1:36:14.333
Not that.

-Hmm?
-Huh-uh.

1:36:16.666 --> 1:36:18.000
Oh, come on, come on.

1:36:18.083 --> 1:36:20.041
It's all he wants.

1:36:20.125 --> 1:36:22.625
The YouTube channel's dying.
He needs the exposure.

1:36:22.708 --> 1:36:26.958
Just put him on Alpha News, baby.
Just a late-night spot.

1:36:27.041 --> 1:36:30.208
And you know he's earned it.
With what he did.

1:36:30.291 --> 1:36:31.500
[Miles] Listen, listen.

1:36:31.583 --> 1:36:33.875
I am building the future of news.

1:36:33.958 --> 1:36:37.291

1:36:40.166 --> 1:36:45.333

[Birdie] There's no stopping it, Peg.

1:36:57.125 --> 1:36:58.833
I can't do this anymore. I'm done.

-Don't. Just don't talk to me!

No! That will destroy us.

The story is gonna break!
There's no stopping it!

1:37:31.625 --> 1:37:33.583
We will do what we always do.

1:37:41.708 --> 1:37:42.583

1:37:43.416 --> 1:37:44.500
It's my secret phone.

1:37:47.166 --> 1:37:48.083
What is this?

1:37:48.666 --> 1:37:51.791
An email from the Sweetie Pants contractor
two years ago.

1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:57.625
"Miss Jay, I'm writing to inform you
that the proposed Bangladesh factory

1:37:57.708 --> 1:38:00.583
is notoriously one of the world's
biggest sweatshops."

1:38:00.666 --> 1:38:01.833
"Please advise."

1:38:03.291 --> 1:38:07.375
And then you replied,
"Sounds perfect. Thanks."

1:38:08.958 --> 1:38:10.791
With your Memoji dabbing.

1:38:15.916 --> 1:38:16.916
Birdie,

1:38:18.916 --> 1:38:23.666
please tell me you did not think
sweatshops are where they make

1:38:25.416 --> 1:38:27.000
sweatpants.

1:38:30.166 --> 1:38:32.208
Oh my God.

1:38:32.291 --> 1:38:34.666
[sighs] Miles is going to pay me off.

1:38:34.750 --> 1:38:37.333
He said if I take full responsibility
for the sweatshops,

1:38:37.416 --> 1:38:39.666
he'll pay me the value of my shares.

1:38:39.750 --> 1:38:40.916
Thirty million.

1:38:41.625 --> 1:38:44.041
I will do whatever I have to do
to save myself,

1:38:44.125 --> 1:38:46.500
and he is my only lifeline.

1:38:47.250 --> 1:38:49.416
<i>-Can I have my secret phone back?</i>
<i>-</i>[Peg] <i>No.</i>

1:38:51.791 --> 1:38:53.125
This never happens in <i>Clue.</i>

1:38:53.208 --> 1:38:54.958
That's because it's a terrible game.

1:38:55.041 --> 1:38:57.125
They all had a motive to protect Miles.

1:38:57.208 --> 1:38:59.916
They were all there that night.
So what now, detective?

1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:01.833
The envelope.

1:39:02.833 --> 1:39:06.708
Whoever killed your sister
took that envelope to protect Miles,

1:39:06.791 --> 1:39:08.500
and they wouldn't just destroy it.

1:39:08.583 --> 1:39:10.916
They would want him to see
what they'd done for him.

1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:13.875
They brought it here. It's here.

1:39:14.458 --> 1:39:16.250
So how are we supposed to find it?

1:39:16.333 --> 1:39:18.791
Well, unless someone brings
an attaché case to dinner,

1:39:18.875 --> 1:39:21.958
they won't have an envelope
that size on their person.

1:39:24.666 --> 1:39:26.583
They'll have to hide it in their room.

1:39:27.583 --> 1:39:29.541
So, at dinner tonight…

1:39:29.625 --> 1:39:32.291

I can buy you maybe five minutes alone
in the Glass Onion, but you have to--

1:45:20.916 --> 1:45:23.208
-Give me that.
-You have to find that envelope.

1:45:23.291 --> 1:45:24.833
-I will.
-That's it…

1:45:24.916 --> 1:45:26.791
Oh, no, give me that. Give me that.

1:45:28.666 --> 1:45:29.750
This'll be good.

1:45:30.916 --> 1:45:31.916
[clears throat]

1:45:33.625 --> 1:45:35.500
Oh. Oh. Oh!

1:45:36.750 --> 1:45:37.583
Shitballs!

1:45:37.666 --> 1:45:38.750
Blanc…

1:45:41.583 --> 1:45:42.458
Yes.

1:45:45.250 --> 1:45:46.666
[systems powering up]

1:45:50.833 --> 1:45:51.875
[Claire] Oh, God.

1:45:53.250 --> 1:45:56.291
[Birdie screams, whimpers]

1:45:59.791 --> 1:46:00.916
[Miles] God, Andi.

1:46:01.875 --> 1:46:03.791
[Benoit] Everyone, inside right now.

1:46:03.875 --> 1:46:06.375
-[Claire] Shouldn't we--
-[Benoit] She's not going anywhere.

1:46:06.458 --> 1:46:08.416
-[Helen grunts softly]
-[Benoit] Inside.

1:46:08.500 --> 1:46:10.083
[Helen whimpering softly]

1:46:10.166 --> 1:46:11.916
[Benoit] It's time to finish this.

1:46:14.333 --> 1:46:15.958
[Helen straining]

1:46:17.375 --> 1:46:19.125
[gasps, blowing nose]

1:46:20.208 --> 1:46:21.208
Shitballs.

1:46:22.708 --> 1:46:24.375
[Miles] It makes no sense.

1:46:24.458 --> 1:46:26.083
[Benoit] This makes perfect sense.

1:46:26.166 --> 1:46:28.458
Duke, Andi, this weekend,

1:46:28.541 --> 1:46:32.333
this ridiculous game that started
well before we set foot on this island.

1:46:32.416 --> 1:46:34.750
Will you explain it
to us all then, detective?

1:46:34.833 --> 1:46:38.500
No, I can peel back the layers,

1:46:38.583 --> 1:46:42.958
I can take it to a point,
but what lies at the center,

1:46:44.750 --> 1:46:48.625
only one person can tell us
who killed Cassandra Brand.

1:46:50.750 --> 1:46:51.583
Who?

1:46:54.083 --> 1:46:59.416
Well, I keep returning,
in my mind, to the Glass Onion.

1:47:01.500 --> 1:47:06.416
<i>Something that seems densely layered,</i>
<i>mysterious and inscrutable.</i>

1:47:06.500 --> 1:47:09.125
<i>But in fact, the center is in plain sight.</i>

1:47:09.208 --> 1:47:10.625
Where? Where?

1:47:11.500 --> 1:47:15.041
And that is why
this case has confounded me like no other.

1:47:15.125 --> 1:47:20.041
Why every complex layer
peeled back has revealed

1:47:20.125 --> 1:47:25.000
another layer and another layer
and come to naught.

1:47:25.541 --> 1:47:28.333
And that was the problem, right there.

1:47:30.500 --> 1:47:34.208
<i>You see, I expected complexity.</i>

1:47:34.750 --> 1:47:39.791
<i>I expected intelligence.</i>
<i>I expected a puzzle, a game.</i>

1:47:41.250 --> 1:47:43.875
<i>But that's not what any of this is.</i>

1:47:45.375 --> 1:47:48.708
<i>It hides not behind complexity,</i>

1:47:48.791 --> 1:47:53.041
<i>but behind mind-numbing obvious clarity.</i>

1:47:55.833 --> 1:47:58.166
<i>Truth is, it doesn't hide at all.</i>

1:47:59.791 --> 1:48:01.583
<i>I was staring right at it.</i>

1:48:02.958 --> 1:48:05.250
[soaring, dramatic music plays]

1:48:15.833 --> 1:48:19.166
The killer nearly struck
my Achilles' heel.

1:48:19.250 --> 1:48:22.291
But thank high heaven, at the last moment,

1:48:22.375 --> 1:48:28.750
I realized what had teased my brain
through this entire case…

1:48:32.041 --> 1:48:33.333
"Inbreathiate."

1:48:36.458 --> 1:48:37.500
It's not a word.

1:48:38.375 --> 1:48:39.291
What?

1:48:39.375 --> 1:48:42.750
Can we just take a second
and fully inbreathiate this moment?

1:48:43.333 --> 1:48:44.625
It's not a real word.

1:48:44.708 --> 1:48:47.666
It kind of sounds like one,
but it's just entirely made up.

1:48:48.250 --> 1:48:49.333
Now "reclamation,"

1:48:49.416 --> 1:48:50.500
now, well, that…

1:48:50.583 --> 1:48:54.416
That is a word, but it's the wrong word.

1:48:54.500 --> 1:48:58.125
This place is the full reclamation
of everything I've achieved up to now.

1:48:58.208 --> 1:48:59.416
This entire day…

1:48:59.500 --> 1:49:00.666
The predefinite detective.

1:49:00.750 --> 1:49:04.208
A veritable minefield of malapropisms…

1:49:04.291 --> 1:49:05.250
The infraction point.

1:49:05.333 --> 1:49:07.041
…and factual errors.

1:49:07.125 --> 1:49:09.208
Bask in the sun, swim in the Ionian Sea.

1:49:09.833 --> 1:49:11.875
That is the Aegean Sea.

1:49:11.958 --> 1:49:15.041
Oh, yeah, it is. It is.

1:49:15.125 --> 1:49:20.250
His dock doesn't float.
His wonder-fuel is a disaster.

1:49:20.333 --> 1:49:24.000
His grasp of disruption theory
is remedial at best.

1:49:24.083 --> 1:49:27.208
He didn't design the puzzle boxes.
He didn't write the mystery.

1:49:27.291 --> 1:49:32.291
<i>Et voilà!</i> It all adds up.
The key to this entire case.

1:49:33.125 --> 1:49:35.125
And it was staring me right in the face.

1:49:36.458 --> 1:49:38.791
Like everyone in the world,

1:49:38.875 --> 1:49:43.041
I assumed Miles Bron was
a complicated genius.

1:49:43.125 --> 1:49:44.291
But why?

1:49:45.833 --> 1:49:49.875
Look into the clear center
of this Glass Onion…

1:49:52.541 --> 1:49:54.291
Miles Bron is an idiot.

1:49:56.125 --> 1:50:01.541
Oh, please.
Just tell us who tried to kill me.

1:50:01.625 --> 1:50:06.416
Nobody tried to kill you,
you vainglorious buffoon.

1:50:06.500 --> 1:50:09.083
Duke took my glass!

1:50:09.166 --> 1:50:11.041
That's what you told us he did.

1:50:11.958 --> 1:50:15.625
He must've picked it up by mistake,
you told us, right after it happened.

1:50:15.708 --> 1:50:19.291
Look at that dress spin.
Birdie, do that again. Watch this.

1:50:19.375 --> 1:50:21.333
And after you said those words,

1:50:21.416 --> 1:50:24.291
that's what we all remember seeing,
but think!

1:50:25.625 --> 1:50:29.291
Ignore his lies, everyone,
and think clearly now.

1:50:29.375 --> 1:50:32.291
What did we all actually see?

1:50:32.375 --> 1:50:35.208
Wow! Look at that dress spin.
Birdie, that's amazing.

1:50:35.291 --> 1:50:36.333
Just…

1:50:36.416 --> 1:50:40.416
-[gasps]
-[Benoit] You handed Duke your own glass.

1:50:40.500 --> 1:50:42.875
Clear as crystal.
Right in front of our eyes.

1:50:42.958 --> 1:50:46.666
All of us.
And then told a bald-faced fabrication.

1:50:47.458 --> 1:50:48.625
And it worked.

1:50:49.208 --> 1:50:51.583
Blanc, are you telling us
Miles killed Duke?

1:50:51.666 --> 1:50:53.625
-Yes.
-Why?

1:50:53.708 --> 1:50:56.291
Because the night
Andi sent you all the emails,

1:50:56.375 --> 1:50:59.041
when Duke got to Andi's house
early on his motorcycle…

1:50:59.125 --> 1:51:00.041
[engine revving]

1:51:01.416 --> 1:51:03.041
[Benoit] …<i>he saw Miles leaving.</i>

1:51:04.583 --> 1:51:05.500
[tires screeching]

1:51:06.958 --> 1:51:08.333
[Benoit]<i> Was almost struck by him.</i>

1:51:08.416 --> 1:51:12.041
<i>In fact, he told all of us.</i>
<i>Right out in the open, he told us.</i>

1:51:12.125 --> 1:51:13.541
Iconic.

1:51:14.208 --> 1:51:17.291
Remember that night you almost pancaked me
with it on the road outside of Andi's?

1:51:17.375 --> 1:51:19.250
Anderson Cooper's birthday? Mm-hmm.

1:51:19.333 --> 1:51:21.833
That night, at Andi's.

1:51:22.416 --> 1:51:25.583
That night, Duke told us
he almost got in an accident.

1:51:25.666 --> 1:51:27.083
He… pancaked?

1:51:27.166 --> 1:51:30.250
Yeah, but Miles had been living in Greece
the past six months.

1:51:30.333 --> 1:51:32.125
No. Whiskey.

1:51:33.416 --> 1:51:36.458
Miles saw you
on your birthday in New York.

1:51:36.541 --> 1:51:40.125
Gave you that necklace for your birthday.
And you're a Taurus.

1:51:41.125 --> 1:51:42.208
I am.

1:51:43.375 --> 1:51:44.875
Two weeks ago.

1:51:44.958 --> 1:51:47.125
-[Benoit] Forget the hydrofuels…
-May 9th.

1:51:47.208 --> 1:51:48.125
…and the sweatshops,

1:51:48.208 --> 1:51:51.166
and the consensual cuckolding
for cable news assignments.

1:51:51.250 --> 1:51:52.083
Sorry, what?

1:51:52.166 --> 1:51:53.333
And focus

1:51:55.208 --> 1:51:56.291
on the envelope.

1:52:03.375 --> 1:52:04.458
[screams]

1:52:04.541 --> 1:52:06.791
[gasps] Holy shit!

1:52:10.875 --> 1:52:12.916
What is reality?

1:52:14.208 --> 1:52:15.291
Andi?

1:52:19.750 --> 1:52:21.458
[Benoit] Who did the envelope threaten?

1:52:24.541 --> 1:52:25.666
Miles Bron.

1:52:28.083 --> 1:52:33.916
<i>That night, Lionel faxed Andi's email</i>
<i>to Miles who received it in New York.</i>

1:52:34.625 --> 1:52:37.916
<i>The one thing that could destroy</i>
<i>his empire of lies,</i>

1:52:38.666 --> 1:52:42.791
<i>the truth in the hands</i>
<i>of the only person unafraid to tell it.</i>

1:52:44.500 --> 1:52:47.458
<i>So Miles drives his Baby Blue Porsche</i>

1:52:47.541 --> 1:52:50.708
<i>to the scene of the crime,</i>
<i>and Andi lets him in.</i>

1:52:50.791 --> 1:52:51.916
<i>Of course she did.</i>

1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:54.833
<i>Miles' machine of lawyers and power</i>

1:52:54.916 --> 1:52:58.166
<i>could destroy her</i>
<i>through sheer dumb force.</i>

1:52:58.250 --> 1:52:59.791
<i>But Miles himself?</i>

1:52:59.875 --> 1:53:02.250
<i>Oh, she was clever enough</i>
<i>not to fear Miles.</i>

1:53:03.916 --> 1:53:10.208
<i>But she didn't see the real threat,</i>
<i>the obvious threat until it was too late.</i>

1:53:20.291 --> 1:53:24.208
Duke alone knew you were there that night,
but he didn't know Andi was dead.

1:53:24.291 --> 1:53:27.750
No, no, he didn't know that
until this evening.

1:53:27.833 --> 1:53:32.000
Right here,
when he got a Google Alert on his phone,

1:53:32.083 --> 1:53:35.125
which has now fallen strangely silent.

1:53:35.625 --> 1:53:37.000
And which he showed to you…

1:53:38.291 --> 1:53:39.208
[gasps]

1:53:39.291 --> 1:53:41.458
…because you don't own a phone.

1:53:42.041 --> 1:53:43.750
Duke! No!

1:53:48.458 --> 1:53:50.375
Did he really think
he could stop all of them

1:53:50.458 --> 1:53:52.208
from finding out about Andi's death?

1:53:52.291 --> 1:53:53.958
They all have phones.

1:53:54.041 --> 1:53:55.458
-Where's my phone?
-[Birdie] Peggy.

1:53:56.250 --> 1:53:57.791
-Phone!
-Still no.

1:53:58.500 --> 1:54:00.416
[Benoit] He didn't need to hide the death.

1:54:00.500 --> 1:54:03.166
He just needed to hide
that Duke had shown him the death

1:54:03.250 --> 1:54:05.541
<i>moments before he was killed.</i>

1:54:06.541 --> 1:54:08.541
<i>Right out in the open, Duke showed him.</i>

1:54:08.625 --> 1:54:10.333
[Duke] That changes things, right?

1:54:10.416 --> 1:54:11.833
It sure does.

1:54:11.916 --> 1:54:15.000
And told him exactly what he wanted
in return for his silence.

1:54:15.083 --> 1:54:18.375
Numbers like this.
Maybe we can talk Alpha News?

1:54:19.208 --> 1:54:21.208
You bet your ass. Come here.

1:54:22.041 --> 1:54:23.541
So what does Miles do?

1:54:23.625 --> 1:54:25.750
Does he keep a vial of poison
in his tooth or something?

1:54:25.833 --> 1:54:26.916
Is that a rich person thing?

1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:31.666
No, no, no, no, it's just…
It's so much stupider than that.

1:54:31.750 --> 1:54:34.666
Birdie, what are the ingredients
to your Cuban Breeze?

1:54:35.291 --> 1:54:38.208
Um, vodka, amaretto.

1:54:38.291 --> 1:54:39.125
Oh, God.

1:54:44.875 --> 1:54:46.708
[Birdie] <i>And… pineapple juice.</i>

1:54:46.791 --> 1:54:49.458
No pineapple in that, right?
Duke don't dance with pineapple.

1:54:50.041 --> 1:54:51.208
An allergy.

1:54:51.291 --> 1:54:52.791
He can't even have a drop.

1:54:52.875 --> 1:54:54.333
Pineapple juice!

1:54:54.833 --> 1:54:58.041
He just put
pineapple juice in his whiskey.

1:54:58.958 --> 1:55:00.375
It's so dumb.

1:55:00.458 --> 1:55:02.791
Oh, it's so dumb, it's brilliant.

1:55:02.875 --> 1:55:05.666
No! It's just dumb!

1:55:06.541 --> 1:55:09.916
"Died of an apparent suicide.
She is survived by her sister, Helen."

1:55:11.208 --> 1:55:12.083
Helen.

1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:17.500
You told me about Helen, your sister--

1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:19.916
[gasps] Oh, wait!

1:55:21.875 --> 1:55:24.291
Helen Brand, ladies and gentlemen.

1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:31.416
And now we come
to Helen's attempted murder,

1:55:31.500 --> 1:55:36.750
which, I have to give you credit for,
did have a sound foundation of thought.

1:55:37.833 --> 1:55:41.333
You realized the opportunity
laid out in front of you.

1:55:41.416 --> 1:55:43.333
You have a house on a remote island,

1:55:43.416 --> 1:55:46.333
<i>filled with desperate people,</i>

1:55:46.416 --> 1:55:51.333
all of whom have a real-life reason
to wish this woman harm. You--

1:55:56.166 --> 1:56:02.500
Furthermore, you have
a loaded gun conveniently within reach.

1:56:05.583 --> 1:56:08.916
And the lights had even been turned off.

1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:10.500
You've taken seven people,

1:56:10.583 --> 1:56:13.208
each of whom has a real-life reason
to wish you harm,

1:56:13.291 --> 1:56:15.583
gathered them together on a remote island,

1:56:15.666 --> 1:56:19.125
and placed the idea
of your murder in their heads.

1:56:19.208 --> 1:56:23.166
It's like putting a loaded gun
on the table and turning off the lights!

1:56:25.083 --> 1:56:26.166
Heavens to…

1:56:27.291 --> 1:56:29.750
You dim-witted, brainless

1:56:30.416 --> 1:56:31.833
jackass!

1:56:32.958 --> 1:56:36.666
Your one murder, with any panache at all,

1:56:37.583 --> 1:56:41.458
and you stole the whole idea from me.

1:56:41.541 --> 1:56:42.750
[dramatic music playing]

1:56:48.166 --> 1:56:49.458
[gunshot]

1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:59.958
And after all that, you…
You still kept the envelope?

1:57:00.875 --> 1:57:02.500
You didn't burn it or anything?

1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:05.500
You recognize this?

1:57:06.625 --> 1:57:08.333
Andi's handwriting.

1:57:09.666 --> 1:57:11.166
I got you, son of a bitch.

1:57:11.250 --> 1:57:14.541

-No.

that yours just doesn't.

-He just burned it!

[Miles] Burned what?
I didn't see anything.

1:57:50.458 --> 1:57:51.416
[Helen] You burned it!

1:57:51.500 --> 1:57:54.041
-Is someone making toast?
-This will not stand.

1:57:54.125 --> 1:57:59.708
Uh-huh. Well, did you see this proof,
this smoking napkin, Blanc?

1:58:01.166 --> 1:58:03.333
No. Did anybody?

1:58:08.583 --> 1:58:10.208
Okay, then wow!

1:58:10.916 --> 1:58:13.750
Wow! We got some big accusations
flying around here.

1:58:14.458 --> 1:58:16.541
Except, everybody seems to have

1:58:16.625 --> 1:58:19.125
a very foggy recollection
of what they actually saw,

1:58:19.208 --> 1:58:22.541
and there's nothing
but totally circumspective evidence.

1:58:22.625 --> 1:58:23.458
[sighs]

1:58:23.541 --> 1:58:27.541
So, if this was just us
playing my murder mystery game,

1:58:27.625 --> 1:58:30.083
which we should have been doing
all weekend,

1:58:30.166 --> 1:58:33.583
then Blanc wins an iPad Pro this time.

1:58:34.625 --> 1:58:36.000
But this is the real world.

1:58:36.666 --> 1:58:40.375
And in the real world, you need
more than a neat, little detective story.

1:58:40.458 --> 1:58:41.958
You need evidence.

1:58:42.041 --> 1:58:45.166
And you've got… nothing.

1:58:45.875 --> 1:58:46.875
Do you?

1:58:54.416 --> 1:58:55.416
He's right.

1:58:57.250 --> 1:59:00.250
The contents of that envelope
and his possession of it

1:59:00.333 --> 1:59:02.583
were our only physical evidence.

1:59:04.375 --> 1:59:05.458
Right.

1:59:08.208 --> 1:59:12.125

it's going to be your word against mine.

1:59:21.250 --> 1:59:22.916

1:59:23.708 --> 1:59:27.416

1:59:31.541 --> 1:59:33.666

1:59:34.541 --> 1:59:38.333
your sister was a complicated woman,
but she meant the world to me.

1:59:39.791 --> 1:59:41.375
And I'm so sorry for your loss.

1:59:50.916 --> 1:59:52.166

1:59:56.125 --> 1:59:58.583

and say, "I saw him take Duke's gun."

2:00:02.375 --> 2:00:04.416

2:00:10.291 --> 2:00:12.541
