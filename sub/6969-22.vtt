When I began my field research
here, these frogs were thriving.

00:14.227 --> 00:18.254
Since then, the adult population
has dropped to fewer than 200.

According to the sheriffs report,
you were the last person
to see Dr. Bailey alive.

05:10.090 --> 05:15.050
- That's what they tell me.
- I understand you argued over
an endangered species petition.

05:15.161 --> 05:17.288
Bailey was the worst kind
of hypocrite.

05:17.397 --> 05:21.265
The closest he came to communing
with nature was subscribing
to National Geographic.

- You sound bitter, Dr. Faraday.
- Of course I'm bitter.

05:25.405 --> 05:29.808
The man wrote off three years
of carefully collected data
in a two-hour inspection...

05:29.876 --> 05:32.902
which doesn't mean
I plotted his demise.

05:34.147 --> 05:36.877

you don't seem too upset by any of this.

as well as anybody, don’t you ?

- Any indigenous species capable
of attacking a human being ?

to minimize its chances of being seen
by its only predator-- us.

31:04.843 --> 31:09.576

It was the name of the harpoonist

My father used to read to me from

I called him 'Ahab, "and
he called me "Starbuck. "

are you coming on to me ?

32:00.031 --> 32:05.833
It’s just--
The truth or a white whale--
what difference does it make ?

32:05.904 --> 32:09.203
Both obsessions are
impossible to capture,

32:09.274 --> 32:11.265

will only leave you dead...

32:11.343 --> 32:14.278

you bring with you.

32:14.346 --> 32:16.337
You know, Mulder,
you are Ahab.

32:18.817 --> 32:22.253
You know, it's interesting
you should say that, because
I've always wanted a peg leg.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.948
It's a boyhood thing
I never grew out of.

32:25.023 --> 32:27.992
No, I'm not being flippant. I mean,
I've given this a lot of thought.

32:28.059 --> 32:30.527
If you have a peg leg
or hooks for hands,

32:30.629 --> 32:32.927
you know, maybe it's enough
to simply carry on living--

32:32.998 --> 32:35.592
you know, bravely facing life
with your disability.

32:35.667 --> 32:39.194
It's heroic just to survive.
But without these things,
you're actually expected...

32:39.271 --> 32:43.207
to make something of your life-- achieve
something, earn a raise, wear a necktie.

32:43.275 --> 32:46.540
So-So-So, if anything,
I'm actually the antithesis of Ahab,

32:46.611 --> 32:50.604
because if I did have a peg leg
I'd quite possibly be more happy
and more content...

32:50.682 --> 32:54.118

these creatures of the unknown.

- And that's not flippant ?
- [ Laughing ] No.

32:57.922 --> 33:01.187
Flippant is my favorite line
from Moby Dick:

33:01.293 --> 33:04.421
" Hell is an idea first born on
an undigested apple dumpling."

33:04.529 --> 33:06.463
Yeah.

33:06.598 --> 33:08.862
[Splashing]

33:17.942 --> 33:20.968
[Splashing Resumes,
Louder]

33:21.046 --> 33:23.480
- What was that ?
- I don't know, but it ain't no duck.

33:25.884 --> 33:29.183
[Splashing Continues]

33:39.197 --> 33:41.131
[ Panting ]

33:45.003 --> 33:47.494
I thought I heard voices.
What are you two doing out here ?

33:47.605 --> 33:51.041
- Dr. Faraday ?
- Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

33:51.142 --> 33:54.839
No. No. We, uh--
we had a little trouble with our boat.

33:54.913 --> 33:57.746
- Actually, it sank.
- How'd that happen ?

33:57.816 --> 34:00.785
It was my fault.
[ Sighs ]

34:00.852 --> 34:04.219
We would have been out here all night if
you hadn't answered our distress call.

34:04.289 --> 34:06.917
Oh, I didn't. I was walking by.
I heard you talking.

34:08.360 --> 34:10.521
- Walking by ?
- Yeah.

34:10.594 --> 34:13.792
Yeah, the shore is just
a stone's throw from here.

34:15.734 --> 34:18.532
[ Chuckling ]
Come on. I'll take you back.

34:40.824 --> 34:44.261
It was just out of fuel.
I think the sheriff will
be along in a couple minutes.

34:44.329 --> 34:46.853
I'd drive you myself,
but I've got work to do.

34:46.931 --> 34:51.094
What exactly is it that you’re
doing out here, Dr. Faraday ?
It's well after midnight.

34:51.202 --> 34:53.693
Well, night is rhinus venisefula's
most active period,

34:53.804 --> 34:56.273
and this is
its primary breeding ground,

34:56.373 --> 34:58.308
or at least it used to be.

34:58.376 --> 35:01.573
Thousands of eggs used
to cling to these reeds--

35:01.646 --> 35:04.547
beautiful jelly clusters.

35:04.616 --> 35:09.076
Now one must turn over many a leaf
in order to find potential offspring.

35:09.154 --> 35:11.645
- What's in the sack ?
- Adult frogs.

35:11.723 --> 35:14.692
I've been breeding them in captivity
and releasing them into the wild.

35:16.127 --> 35:18.721
[Scully]
This is Striker’s Cove ?

35:18.797 --> 35:20.992
- Mm-hmm.
- The frogs--

35:21.065 --> 35:24.592
- I beg your pardon ?
- The unexplained depletion of
frogs originates from this cove.

35:24.702 --> 35:28.297
- It's the food chain.
- What about it ?

35:28.406 --> 35:30.806
The food chain. If you alter
one life-form in an ecosystem,

35:30.875 --> 35:34.606
the rest is necessarily affected,
either by an increase or decrease.

35:34.679 --> 35:37.910
So, if an aquatic dinosaur's
diet consisted primarily of frogs,

35:37.982 --> 35:42.248
then if those frogs became scarce,
it would have to turn
to an alternative food source.

35:42.320 --> 35:44.845
- Humans.
- Agent Mulder,

35:44.923 --> 35:49.690
you are taking my legitimate research
and basic biological principle...

35:49.761 --> 35:52.161
and stretching them both
way out of proportion...

35:52.230 --> 35:55.825
in an effort to give
some kind of validity
to an entirely ludicrous theory.

35:55.934 --> 35:58.402
There is no prehistoric
lake monster.

35:58.503 --> 36:02.564
This creature lives here in this cove.
That explains the disappearance
of these frogs,

36:02.674 --> 36:05.609
for which you have no explanation,
Doctor, ludicrous or not,

36:05.677 --> 36:08.043
- as well as the recent human attacks.
- That's crazy!

36:08.112 --> 36:11.673
If something was living in these waters,
you don't think I would've seen it ?

36:11.749 --> 36:13.876
I’ve been conducting research
here for three years.

36:13.952 --> 36:17.786
I'm talking about a prehistoric animal
that's gone unnoticed for virtually
thousands of years.

36:17.856 --> 36:19.983
If it knows how to do anything,
it knows how to hide.

36:20.058 --> 36:23.858
They say the Loch Ness Monster
doesn't live in the water,
it lives in the surrounding cliffs.

36:23.928 --> 36:29.560
Maybe Big Blue has an inland habitat,
somewhere in the rocks
or in this dense forest here.

36:29.667 --> 36:32.135
I have no time
for these absurdities.

36:34.105 --> 36:38.235
If you’ll excuse me,
I have some amphibians to release.

36:41.479 --> 36:43.413
Well, Captain, what now ?

36:43.481 --> 36:47.144
- [ Sighs ]
-[Sheriff]
Agent Scully! Agent Mulder!

36:47.218 --> 36:49.652
There's been another death,

36:49.721 --> 36:54.090
and this time it does appear to
be some kind of animal attack--
bit a fisherman's arm clean off.

36:54.158 --> 36:57.184
- Where did this happen ?
- Other side of the lake,
couple hours ago.

36:57.262 --> 36:59.753
My department has the cooperation
of the state police,

36:59.831 --> 37:02.698
plus the full use of all the Wildlife
Fish and Game Department vessels.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.927
I got a full-scale
water search already underway.

37:05.036 --> 37:08.130
No, we need those men here,
searching this cove and these woods.

37:08.239 --> 37:12.073
But I got 30 boats on the water already.
If we’re gonna kill this thing--

37:12.143 --> 37:15.408
We gotta sweep this cove.
It's here at Striker's Cove.

37:15.480 --> 37:19.280
The boats are searching
the area of the latest attack,
and I'm not gonna move them.

37:19.350 --> 37:22.183
Now, if you wanna waste your time
conducting a search of these woods,

37:22.253 --> 37:24.847
you go right ahead--
I got me a lake monster to catch.

37:24.923 --> 37:28.017
[Dispatcher Over Radio,
indistinct]

37:28.092 --> 37:30.060
Sheriff,

37:30.128 --> 37:32.562
Agent Mulder and I would appreciate it
if you could spare us...

37:32.630 --> 37:35.064
two or three of your men
to assist us here.

37:35.133 --> 37:38.660
[ Sighs ]
All right. I'll send 'em on back.

37:41.873 --> 37:44.000
Thanks.

37:44.108 --> 37:46.133
[Distant Rustling,
Screaming]

37:46.210 --> 37:51.238
- What was that ?
- Dr. Faraday.

37:51.316 --> 37:53.250
[ Frogs Croaking ]

37:57.889 --> 38:01.960
[Screaming]

38:07.098 --> 38:10.727
- What happened ?
- My leg-- something grabbed my leg.

38:10.802 --> 38:13.327
- Did you see it ?
- No. [Grunts]

38:13.404 --> 38:17.864
It came from behind me.
Before I knew it, it had me--
shaking me back and forth.

38:17.942 --> 38:20.740
- Then it just let go.
- Give me your belt.

38:23.147 --> 38:26.548
- I didn't want to believe you.
- I think you nicked an artery.

38:26.618 --> 38:29.052
We've gotta get him to a hospital.
He's losing blood.

38:29.120 --> 38:31.884
- Where'd it go ?
- I didn't see it.
I didn't see it. [ Groans ]

38:31.956 --> 38:35.790
I think I heard-- It went through
those reeds. [ Groans ]

38:35.860 --> 38:38.693
- Mulder, help is coming.
- You take care of him, Scully.

38:38.763 --> 38:40.697
Mulder !

38:42.967 --> 38:46.835
- [ Sighs ]
- [ Groans ]

38:51.209 --> 38:53.143
[Insects Chirping]

39:05.657 --> 39:07.591
[Twigs Snapping]

39:29.447 --> 39:32.382
[Twigs Snapping,
Thudding]

39:38.056 --> 39:39.853
[ Croaking ]

39:39.924 --> 39:43.121
[ Sighs ]

39:59.377 --> 40:02.175

40:22.533 --> 40:25.297

40:35.480 --> 40:38.313
[Frogs Croaking]

40:38.382 --> 40:41.283
[Sheriff]
All right, then. Go ahead.

40:52.964 --> 40:54.989
How's Dr. Faraday ?

40:56.567 --> 40:59.263
He'll be fine.

40:59.337 --> 41:01.498
- How are you ?
- I'm fine.

41:03.674 --> 41:06.643
Well, you slew
the big white whale, Ahab.

41:06.744 --> 41:10.874
- Yeah, but I still don't have
that peg leg. [ Laughs ]
- How can you be disappointed ?

41:10.948 --> 41:14.349
That alligator would have gone
through the local population
if you hadn't killed it.

41:14.418 --> 41:16.716
I know.

41:16.788 --> 41:20.349
I guess I just wanted
Big Blue to be real.

41:20.424 --> 41:23.393
I guess I see hope
in such a possibility.

41:23.461 --> 41:28.990
Well, there's still hope. That's why
these myths and stories have endured.

41:29.066 --> 41:31.330
People want to believe.
