01:44.060 --> 01:45.148
Hello.

01:45.279 --> 01:46.734
Can we interest you
in some cookies?

01:46.758 --> 01:48.020
I'd be delighted.

01:51.023 --> 01:52.503
I will take two boxes.

01:55.463 --> 01:56.463
For Frank.

01:59.641 --> 02:03.079
Here you go.

02:03.210 --> 02:08.127
Well, aren't you the most
adorable little girl

02:08.258 --> 02:09.258
I've ever seen.

02:12.175 --> 02:15.004
Are you all right?

02:15.135 --> 02:16.875
Yes, darling.

02:17.006 --> 02:18.006
You can run along now.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.138
You sure as hell
picked the wrong house.

03:49.707 --> 03:51.535
All right.

04:25.961 --> 04:30.661
You want some water,
something to eat?

04:30.792 --> 04:32.402
I can have somebody
get you something.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.364
You a God-fearing man, Buddy?

04:43.544 --> 04:45.807
I ain't been to church.

04:45.937 --> 04:48.264
It can be a hard commitment trying
to make ends meet, what

04:48.288 --> 04:52.422
with a newborn baby, right?

04:52.553 --> 04:55.338
Yeah.

04:55.469 --> 04:59.734
I wasn't very religious myself
growing up, but,

04:59.864 --> 05:02.040
this job has shown me some
things... things that,

05:02.171 --> 05:04.260
I can't erase from my mind.

05:04.391 --> 05:08.873
And they've been burned
into my soul forever.

05:09.004 --> 05:12.703
I have to admit there have been
some moments when I wasn't

05:12.834 --> 05:15.271
sure I'd be able
to go on, but then

05:15.402 --> 05:19.449
my faith carries me through.

05:19.580 --> 05:22.409
You ever have moments like that?

05:22.539 --> 05:24.844
You feel like right now
might be one of those moments?

05:27.196 --> 05:30.939
Well, sure am sorry about this.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.873
I mean, breaking and entering,
that's one thing.

05:32.897 --> 05:33.985
But murder?

05:34.116 --> 05:36.640
Damn, that is a
whole other story.

05:36.771 --> 05:40.078
And I hate to tell you
that all signs clearly point

05:40.209 --> 05:41.340
to you being the murderer.

05:45.301 --> 05:47.738
I want you to help me
understand your side.

05:51.873 --> 05:57.444
Take your time, deep breaths
and all, and tell me what happened.

06:06.540 --> 06:09.543
Give me just a minute
of your time, sir.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.545
Now, remember I
said profit margins

06:11.675 --> 06:12.870
were growing last week, right?

06:12.894 --> 06:15.853
Well, they didn't stop.

06:15.984 --> 06:17.681
Look at this.

06:17.812 --> 06:22.164
Success story, after
success story, after success story.

06:22.294 --> 06:24.471
I mean, the list goes on, man.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.341
It's... it's... it's...
Guaranteed money.

06:28.823 --> 06:31.260
Look, what does the Lord say?

06:31.391 --> 06:32.783
You reap what you sow.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.437
Right?

06:34.568 --> 06:37.003
You sow one of this, I'm telling
you, man, you will reap.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.616
You know,
that's... that's... that's the truth.

06:39.747 --> 06:41.270
I... look, I gotta go.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.943
You... you give me a call
if you, change your mind?

06:42.967 --> 06:43.446
All right?

06:43.577 --> 06:45.230
OK.

06:45.361 --> 06:46.361
Hey, baby.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.801
Hey.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.934
You all right?

06:55.850 --> 06:58.418
She is coughing
again this morning.

06:58.548 --> 07:00.855
We need to get her
to a doctor soon.

07:00.985 --> 07:01.985
Yeah, we will.

07:03.988 --> 07:05.945
May have to wait till
after the storm, though.

07:06.034 --> 07:09.733
I got some good
things in the works.

07:09.864 --> 07:12.910
Buddy, we've talked about this.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.912
I believe in you,
and I know things

07:15.043 --> 07:16.281
are going to come
through eventually,

07:16.305 --> 07:18.307
but we need money now.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.396
I know.

07:20.527 --> 07:21.876
You're right.

07:22.006 --> 07:23.530
I saw a sign out front.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.314
They need bussers.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.510
I'll do manual labor myself if
I can get a sitter for Emily...

07:27.534 --> 07:28.230
No.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.100
Absolutely not.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.101
No, no.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.494
I'm gonna take care of it.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.670
Now, Frank called today
about a fencing job.

07:33.801 --> 07:37.674
I guess I got requested,
so l'll go down and see if I

07:37.805 --> 07:41.461
can get some cash up front, or.

07:41.591 --> 07:42.591
OK.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.747
Listen, I've been thinking.

07:47.771 --> 07:53.211
It's been intense lately.

07:53.342 --> 07:54.517
A bit stressful.

07:57.825 --> 08:00.784
I was just thinking maybe
we let your sister watch Emily

08:00.915 --> 08:03.570
for a weekend, and,
you know, we have

08:03.700 --> 08:06.355
just a little one-on-one time.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.357
Seriously?

08:08.488 --> 08:09.663
It's been six months.

08:12.622 --> 08:14.798
I know, I'm sorry.

08:14.929 --> 08:18.715
And I know you've been patient.

08:18.846 --> 08:23.241
Since the baby, I
just don't feel sexy.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.161
Just give me a bit more time.

08:33.904 --> 08:35.775
All right.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.008
Hey, there.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.098
I'm here about the fence.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.605
Look, somebody called
and requested I come.

09:02.629 --> 09:03.891
Buddy.

09:12.421 --> 09:13.901
What happened?

09:14.031 --> 09:15.206
Can you fix it?

09:15.337 --> 09:16.773
It shouldn't be a problem.

09:16.904 --> 09:18.514
Today.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.492
Well, today was just supposed
to be the estimate.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.605
You know, we got a
hurricane coming.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.215
It's just a piece of fence.

09:24.346 --> 09:25.913
It's not even 1 o'clock yet.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.002
You got plenty of time.

09:28.132 --> 09:30.178
I'll make it worth your while.

09:30.308 --> 09:33.355
Worth my while?

09:33.485 --> 09:34.485
What you thinking?

09:35.705 --> 09:38.969
There he is,
mister negotiator all of a sudden.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.144
What's it gonna cost me?

09:42.756 --> 09:44.584
Let's see.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.760
You gotta replace
this whole part,

09:46.890 --> 09:49.763
so, I mean, that's probably,
what, seven feet?

09:49.893 --> 09:52.592
So that's about 10
bucks a post, tax,

09:52.722 --> 09:54.028
you're looking at around 100.

09:54.158 --> 09:58.641
So all in, I'd say,
200 would be safe.

09:58.772 --> 10:06.040
Well, you get it done the
day, I'll give you 250.

10:06.170 --> 10:06.997
300?

10:07.128 --> 10:07.911
240, final offer.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.042
Deal.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.523
I want it done today.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.917
Where were you stationed?

10:14.048 --> 10:17.921
1st Battalion 10th Marines,
Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.052
Gunslingers, right?

10:23.840 --> 10:26.103
How'd you know that?

10:26.234 --> 10:27.234
Navy man.

10:27.278 --> 10:28.758
Just got back.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.586
Well, I'll be damned.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.762
Yeah, I know they call
y'all squids, but you

10:32.893 --> 10:36.418
look more like a tadpole to me.

10:36.548 --> 10:38.507
What do they call
you Marines again?

10:38.638 --> 10:41.858
If you call me a jarhead,
you watch what happens.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.301
I'm just fucking with you.

10:50.432 --> 10:51.432
Get to work.

11:02.009 --> 11:06.883
The way you wear your hat.

11:07.014 --> 11:11.714
The way you sip your tea.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.977
The memory of all that.

11:18.547 --> 11:25.685
No, they can't take
that away from me.

11:25.815 --> 11:29.123
The way you smile just beams.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.128
The way you sing off-key.

11:39.394 --> 11:43.659
The way you haunt my dreams.

11:43.790 --> 11:48.533
No, they can't take
that away from me.

11:53.451 --> 11:54.757
Happy anniversary, baby.

12:07.204 --> 12:08.510
What are you doing?

12:08.640 --> 12:11.165
What's it look like?

12:11.295 --> 12:13.776
All these years,
I still don't mean that much to you.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.343
Shit.

12:15.473 --> 12:17.519
Baby doll.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.173
I don't want to hear it!

12:19.303 --> 12:22.045
I messed up.

12:25.135 --> 12:27.137
To think I put this on for you.

12:31.576 --> 12:34.057
I apologize, OK?

12:34.188 --> 12:35.188
I don't want it.

12:37.669 --> 12:42.326
I love you the same,
so much, every day.

12:42.457 --> 12:45.765
I don't know why one day has to
be more important than all

12:45.895 --> 12:47.549
the rest of them.

12:47.679 --> 12:54.948
Because it is the day our
love merged and was forever united.

12:55.078 --> 12:58.995
I don't know why every
year I think maybe...

12:59.126 --> 13:02.694
Maybe this year Walter will come
to a deeper understanding.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.131
I'm sorry.

13:04.261 --> 13:07.308
I don't know what
else I can say or do.

13:07.438 --> 13:10.659
Why don't you do what
a man's supposed to do.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.531
And what is that exactly?

13:13.662 --> 13:16.099
Paint the house.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.972
Mow the lawn.

13:19.102 --> 13:23.411
Make love to me like
a real man instead

13:23.541 --> 13:25.892
of sitting on your lazy
ass and getting drunk all day.

13:42.473 --> 13:48.305
Now, you push me
once, I can let it go.

13:48.436 --> 13:52.483
Push me twice, I might react.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.707
Do it.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.404
Go on.

14:00.535 --> 14:03.451
Hurt me, Walter.

14:03.581 --> 14:06.019
Hurt me real bad.

14:06.149 --> 14:07.934
Let's see if you got the balls.

14:17.595 --> 14:20.468
I knew it.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.905
You simply lack what it
takes to follow through.

15:04.338 --> 15:05.861
And in local news,

15:05.992 --> 15:08.168
another teenager has
been reported missing.

15:08.298 --> 15:12.085
16-year-old Jeff Goudet was
last seen wearing a black tracksuit

15:12.215 --> 15:13.651
with white stripes.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.348
Members of the
public should contact.

15:15.436 --> 15:17.481
Detective Jones of the
Sheriff's Department

15:17.612 --> 15:19.570
if they have any information.

15:19.701 --> 15:23.357
And now over to Jessica
for updates on the hurricane.

15:23.487 --> 15:24.967
As you can see, Hurricane Jody

15:25.098 --> 15:27.448
is now a Category 3
storm out in the Gulf.

15:27.578 --> 15:29.493
But models expect
it to gain strength

15:29.624 --> 15:30.930
before it makes landfall.

15:57.130 --> 15:58.958
You look like you're
about to pass out.

16:02.222 --> 16:04.354
No, ma'am, I'm... I'm good.

16:04.485 --> 16:06.966
Who you calling ma'am?

16:07.096 --> 16:09.664
I'm very sorry... Missus...

16:09.794 --> 16:13.798
Fancy, short for
Francine Mae Franklin.

16:13.929 --> 16:15.844
Your name?

16:15.975 --> 16:17.715
Buddy.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.239
It's a pleasure to meet you.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.113
You want some?

16:30.859 --> 16:31.859
Iced tea.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.560
Yeah.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.345
Yeah, that sounds
nice, actually.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.351
Seems kind of down
to try and fix a fence

16:44.481 --> 16:46.198
right before a hurricane
comes, but that's

16:46.222 --> 16:47.832
my idiot husband for you.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.051
It's all right.

16:49.182 --> 16:51.271
I... I like to
finish what I start.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.101
You live far from here?

16:55.231 --> 16:56.711
On the other side of town.

16:56.841 --> 16:59.105
I can make it home if I hurry.

16:59.235 --> 17:02.978
I always loved the
calm before a storm.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.108
Birds are smart.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.026
Why's that?

17:10.724 --> 17:13.075
They leave before it arrives.

17:13.205 --> 17:14.337
They can sense the danger.

17:17.732 --> 17:19.951
Well, thank you very much.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.780
I should probably
get back to it.

17:22.911 --> 17:23.911
You're very welcome.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.532
Shit!

17:35.663 --> 17:37.534
Are you OK?

17:37.665 --> 17:38.665
Yeah.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.885
Yes, ma'am, I'm fine, I'm fine.

17:41.016 --> 17:43.540
Come on, let me see.

17:43.671 --> 17:44.802
It's all right, I promise.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.848
I'm good.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.111
Come on inside.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.417
We'll get you all cleaned up.

17:51.461 --> 17:52.767
I appreciate that, but I...

17:52.897 --> 17:54.310
I really gotta finish
up here and get home...

17:54.334 --> 17:55.334
I'm not asking.

18:16.573 --> 18:20.142
Thanks, but I... I can...
I can do that.

18:20.273 --> 18:21.839
No guest of mine
will not be attended

18:21.970 --> 18:23.711
to by the queen of this house.

18:23.841 --> 18:26.235
Are you the queen of this house?

18:26.366 --> 18:27.889
No, I'm not.

18:28.019 --> 18:30.413
Exactly.

18:30.544 --> 18:31.544
Let me see.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.208
All better.

18:50.651 --> 18:52.740
What, we good here?

18:52.870 --> 18:55.264
I hurt my hand.

18:55.395 --> 18:56.395
Did you, now?

19:01.183 --> 19:02.618
I'm... I'm try and finish up.

19:05.492 --> 19:08.234
You just can't help
yourself, can you?

19:08.364 --> 19:09.104
I'm sorry.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.498
Does that bother you?

19:11.628 --> 19:12.934
Doesn't bother me one bit.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.325
Hey, what the hell?

20:46.288 --> 20:48.072
Fucking asshole.

20:51.119 --> 20:53.164
Are you fucking kidding me?

20:54.775 --> 20:56.318
What the fuck's the matter with
you, asshole?

20:56.342 --> 20:59.170
There you are.

21:35.206 --> 21:37.165
Hey, I'm...

21:37.296 --> 21:39.166
I'm real sorry, but I
wasn't able to finish.

21:39.254 --> 21:42.562
I can come back early next week, wrap it up.

21:42.692 --> 21:44.172
It's gonna be 100, then.

21:44.303 --> 21:48.350
You didn't live up to
your end of the bargain.

21:48.481 --> 21:50.221
Come on, man.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.503
It started raining out there.

21:51.527 --> 21:52.659
It's not my fault.

21:52.789 --> 21:53.897
Looks like the good Lord doesn't

21:53.921 --> 21:56.663
want you to make extra money.

21:56.793 --> 21:57.793
That's gotta hurt.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.975
Fine.

22:05.106 --> 22:07.978
Thank you,
for the iced tea and the Band-Aid.

22:08.109 --> 22:09.763
You're very welcome.

22:09.893 --> 22:12.853
How would you like
to stay for dinner?

22:12.983 --> 22:16.073
That's, very kind of you, but, actually,

22:16.204 --> 22:17.834
my... my daughter's a
little under the weather

22:17.858 --> 22:19.598
and my wife's at home
taking care of her,

22:19.642 --> 22:22.558
so I should, you know,
make sure they're all right in the storm.

22:22.689 --> 22:23.777
Of course.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.126
You hear that, Walt?

22:25.256 --> 22:27.476
This man actually
cares for his family.

22:27.607 --> 22:30.523
Outstanding.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.773
No, no, no, no, no.

23:39.026 --> 23:41.028
Let me get this straight.

23:41.158 --> 23:44.640
You said your truck
wouldn't start.

23:44.771 --> 23:51.168
Yeah.

23:51.299 --> 23:53.432
I mean, no.

23:53.562 --> 23:55.695
Is it yes or no?

23:55.825 --> 23:56.825
No.

23:59.263 --> 24:02.789
Had you ever met
the Franklins before that day?

24:02.919 --> 24:04.486
Seen Walt around
town a few times.

24:04.617 --> 24:06.532
Never spoke to him.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.272
OK.

24:08.403 --> 24:12.842
And you robbed a liquor
store with a spray painted BB gun.

24:15.845 --> 24:16.845
Yeah.

24:21.895 --> 24:24.463
My dad needed his booze,
and l wasn't prepared to take

24:24.593 --> 24:26.508
another ass whooping.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.399
You ever wonder what you might
have done if the store

24:28.423 --> 24:29.771
clerk had refused your demands?

24:32.645 --> 24:33.645
Never thought about it.

24:37.301 --> 24:41.001
Looks like I just hit a nerve.

24:41.131 --> 24:42.306
I didn't mean to.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.003
I'm just trying to
find out if you're

24:44.047 --> 24:47.137
the type of guy who secret likes
hurting other people.

24:47.268 --> 24:50.924
Are you that kind of guy, Buddy?

24:51.054 --> 24:55.798
No, I'm not.

24:55.929 --> 24:58.497
You seem to be forgetting l'm
trying to help you.

24:58.627 --> 25:00.149
But I need you to
help me in return.

25:00.237 --> 25:03.545
Now, if you are a God-fearing man like I am,

25:03.676 --> 25:06.330
you also know that
God can forgive you.

25:06.461 --> 25:09.072
The question is,
can you forgive yourself for what you did?

25:12.685 --> 25:16.993
I didn't do anything.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.342
So you went back inside.

25:30.093 --> 25:31.617
What is it, tadpole?

25:31.747 --> 25:33.401
Can't swim?

25:33.532 --> 25:35.272
My... my truck won't start.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.448
If... if I left my equipment
and my truck here,

25:37.579 --> 25:39.015
could I use your car to go home?

25:39.146 --> 25:41.496
I... I gotta check on my family.

25:41.627 --> 25:44.194
What, you think I'll let you
pull some backdoor trade

25:44.325 --> 25:46.283
and leave me with a
beat-up truck while

25:46.414 --> 25:48.198
you steal my Mach 1 Mustang?

25:50.200 --> 25:52.638
Backdoor trade, man?

25:52.768 --> 25:55.554
You... you best get comfy.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.338
Look, I... I gotta call my wife.

25:57.468 --> 25:59.819
Can I use your phone?

25:59.949 --> 26:00.949
Be my guest.

26:23.886 --> 26:24.757
Hello?

26:24.887 --> 26:25.453
Hey, babe.

26:25.584 --> 26:25.975
Hey, it's me.

26:26.106 --> 26:26.715
Hey.

26:26.846 --> 26:27.586
Where are you?

26:27.716 --> 26:30.197
I've been worried sick.

26:30.327 --> 26:30.937
I got stuck at my job.

26:31.067 --> 26:33.200
I... What do you
mean you got stuck?

26:33.330 --> 26:35.724
I know, I'm sorry.

26:35.855 --> 26:42.862
It's not my fault.
I tried to finish, and it started raining.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.255
The truck was stalling.

26:45.386 --> 26:47.431
Damn it, Buddy.

26:47.562 --> 26:49.540
You shouldn't have waited so
long to try and leave.

26:49.564 --> 26:51.871
Now you can't even call a cab.

26:52.001 --> 26:53.350
Yeah, I can't leave.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.790
How's Emily?

26:57.920 --> 27:00.227
She's still coughing.

27:03.839 --> 27:06.233
Missing you.

27:06.363 --> 27:09.976
Listen, stay away from the
windows, you know.

27:10.106 --> 27:11.151
It shouldn't be too bad.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.893
I'll be home as soon as I can.

27:17.897 --> 27:20.029
Great.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.682
You just stay there nice and cozy
at some stranger's house.

27:22.771 --> 27:25.644
We'll be fine on our own.

27:28.777 --> 27:31.736
If you'd like to make a call...
Love you.

27:36.219 --> 27:38.395
Happiness?

27:38.526 --> 27:40.354
Come on, have some wine, relax.

27:40.484 --> 27:43.009
I... I don't really drink.

27:43.139 --> 27:44.706
We got a hurricane coming.

27:44.837 --> 27:46.273
What else are you gonna do?

27:50.930 --> 27:54.281
All right.

27:54.411 --> 27:55.804
Semper Fi.

28:27.923 --> 28:28.923
How's the meatloaf?

28:31.448 --> 28:32.448
Really great.

28:44.026 --> 28:45.549
So how'd you two meet?

28:45.680 --> 28:49.336
You don't want to
hear about any of that.

28:49.466 --> 28:52.339
We met shortly after
Walt came back from Nam.

28:56.299 --> 28:58.824
I was singing in a
club in New Orleans...

28:58.954 --> 29:00.564
Jazz singer.

29:00.695 --> 29:03.350
Walt came in to watch.

29:03.480 --> 29:09.138
He was an alluring mix
of strength and courage, hope.

29:18.495 --> 29:21.977
How times have changed.

29:22.108 --> 29:23.282
Where'd you meet your wife?

29:26.765 --> 29:30.551
Well, we, met in sixth grade.

29:30.681 --> 29:33.902
And I... I knew right
then she was the one.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.645
Got married when we
graduated high school.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.603
That's beautiful.

29:39.734 --> 29:41.431
What's so beautiful about it?

29:41.562 --> 29:44.347
The poor bastard's only gonna
sleep with one woman

29:44.478 --> 29:47.046
for the rest of his
life, if he doesn't get

29:47.176 --> 29:48.830
divorced before he turns 30.

30:01.234 --> 30:02.757
How long have you
two been married?

30:02.888 --> 30:04.672
15 years tonight.

30:04.803 --> 30:10.330
But we've known each
other way, way, way longer.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.898
It seems like a lifetime.

30:13.028 --> 30:14.421
Multiple lifetimes.

30:19.643 --> 30:24.344
Buddy, how would
you like a mint julep?

30:24.474 --> 30:26.999
It's my great-grandmother's recipe.

30:27.129 --> 30:28.129
Sounds great.

30:40.664 --> 30:45.060
Looks like it's just me and you.

30:45.191 --> 30:46.714
You a football fan?

30:46.845 --> 30:49.195
More a baseball guy.

30:49.325 --> 30:50.413
Eh.

30:50.544 --> 30:53.808
Makes sense you
like a soft sport.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.942
You know, ever since the
NFL strike, it's been nothing

30:57.072 --> 31:00.206
but lies and deception.

31:00.336 --> 31:04.210
You... you... you know
about deception, don't you?

31:04.340 --> 31:05.733
Not sure I follow.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.823
I mean, I can tell
you're having problems at home.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.782
An example, when
was the last time you

31:11.913 --> 31:16.744
had your, cock, sucked?

31:16.875 --> 31:17.876
Excuse me?

31:18.006 --> 31:19.006
That long?

31:19.094 --> 31:20.530
Egad.

31:20.661 --> 31:22.010
You know what else I can tell?

31:23.577 --> 31:24.970
What's that?

31:25.100 --> 31:26.667
I can tell you
want to fuck my wife.

31:26.797 --> 31:27.797
What?

31:28.147 --> 31:29.975
What'd I miss?

31:30.105 --> 31:33.239
Buddy here was just telling
me how lonely he is.

31:33.369 --> 31:35.850
Appears he and his
wife haven't been able to spend

31:35.981 --> 31:37.547
any quality time together.

31:37.678 --> 31:38.897
I never said that.

31:39.027 --> 31:40.352
That woman must
be out of her mind

31:40.376 --> 31:42.137
if she doesn't know how
to take care of you.

31:42.161 --> 31:44.685
Yeah.

31:44.815 --> 31:46.426
She treats me fine.

31:46.556 --> 31:51.126
You are a smart, fine,
well-spoken young man.

31:51.257 --> 31:53.215
If she can't see that,
then shame on her.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.397
How's that julep taste?

32:04.313 --> 32:05.749
It's really nice.

32:20.939 --> 32:24.551
I'm go check on Walt.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.874
There are still no updates tonight

32:44.005 --> 32:46.965
on the disappearance of local
teenager Jeff Goudet,

32:47.095 --> 32:51.099
who is the fourth local teenager
to go missing recently.

32:51.230 --> 32:53.797
So far the Sheriff's
Department have no leads

32:53.928 --> 32:56.104
on any of the missing
children and no reason

32:56.235 --> 32:59.716
to believe that these
cases are linked.

32:59.847 --> 33:03.111
Stay tuned to Grand Isle News for
updates on all local news.

33:03.242 --> 33:04.591
And now, the weather.

33:07.724 --> 33:10.989
How about I give you
a tour of the house?

33:11.119 --> 33:11.859
It's all right.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.253
I... I was just gonna...

33:14.383 --> 33:17.778
This is obviously
Walter's favorite room.

33:17.908 --> 33:22.217
This house has been in
my family for over 150 years.

33:22.348 --> 33:26.047
My great-great-grandfather
was a big time real estate man.

33:26.178 --> 33:29.181
My grandparents
loved this house.

33:29.311 --> 33:34.273
Sometimes I think I can
feel their presence.

33:34.403 --> 33:36.710
In here we used
to entertain over

33:36.840 --> 33:40.844
half the city throwing
parties like you wouldn't believe.

33:40.975 --> 33:43.934
Not anymore.

33:45.327 --> 33:48.635
Well, you already
know the kitchen.

33:48.765 --> 33:49.765
What's in here?

34:00.168 --> 34:01.474
Bad things, Buddy.

34:05.608 --> 34:06.914
Real bad things.

34:11.962 --> 34:13.312
I'm just messing with you.

34:14.791 --> 34:16.159
That just leads down
to the basement.

34:16.184 --> 34:19.492
There's nothing down
there but storage.

34:19.621 --> 34:21.449
Come on, let's go upstairs.

34:41.166 --> 34:42.775
This is my favorite
room in the house.

34:45.605 --> 34:47.172
Come on in.

34:47.302 --> 34:49.652
You can have a seat here.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.176
Oof!

34:51.306 --> 34:53.612
I'm change into something
more comfortable.

34:59.009 --> 35:05.146
Despite all the rain coming down,
it is still so damn hot.

35:22.946 --> 35:30.171
Is it true that your
wife don't treat you right?

35:30.302 --> 35:31.085
No.

35:31.216 --> 35:32.260
No, she's... she's good.

35:32.391 --> 35:36.045
It's... you know, it's just...
Just what?

35:40.268 --> 35:45.621
I... just... It...
since Emily...

35:45.752 --> 35:48.015
Connected like we used to.

35:48.146 --> 35:51.540
You know, it just...
Just built up distance.

35:51.671 --> 35:55.153
Well, I understand how
a child changes everything.

35:58.112 --> 36:01.376
Ever since I was a little girl,
I have always wanted

36:01.507 --> 36:06.207
a huge family of my very own.

36:06.338 --> 36:08.556
Do you and...
and Walter have... Have kids?

36:11.821 --> 36:15.564
The Lord didn't
grant me the ability.

36:15.695 --> 36:21.875
I can't have one... Medically.

36:22.005 --> 36:25.226
I see.

36:25.357 --> 36:26.749
There are always other measures.

36:29.491 --> 36:31.535
Walter and I have had to
make some hard choices.

36:36.803 --> 36:39.632
Does your wife have a job?

36:39.762 --> 36:40.894
No.

36:41.024 --> 36:43.201
Just the yougin'.

36:43.331 --> 36:46.378
It's so unfortunate she doesn't
realize what she has.

36:46.508 --> 36:48.031
We'll figure it out.

36:50.860 --> 36:53.341
Without the sweet touch
of love, we ain't got nothing.

36:57.824 --> 37:01.480
Have you ever been
with another woman?

37:01.610 --> 37:02.828
Well, that's a bit personal.

37:06.572 --> 37:09.618
Well, then, let me
rephrase the question.

37:09.749 --> 37:12.230
Have you ever been
with an older woman?

37:16.843 --> 37:18.627
Have you ever
fantasized about it?

37:22.109 --> 37:24.720
I've never been
with a younger man.

37:24.851 --> 37:27.984
Never had the opportunity.

37:28.115 --> 37:31.640
But I have fantasized
about it many times.

37:34.687 --> 37:37.211
You know what I do to
myself when I fantasize?

37:40.127 --> 37:41.259
I could probably guess.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.134
Can I tell you my
young boy fantasy?

37:50.093 --> 37:51.093
If you'd like.

37:53.793 --> 37:59.146
Well, he walks me
into a luscious garden

37:59.277 --> 38:00.277
filled with flowers.

38:02.758 --> 38:07.197
And then he kisses me
real soft-like on the lips.

38:07.328 --> 38:13.813
Then he kisses my neck,
and then my breast, and then my stomach.

38:16.772 --> 38:20.559
Then he's down on his knees
right in front of me.

38:24.998 --> 38:27.522
And then he starts
kissing my thighs.

38:36.009 --> 38:38.403
Should I keep going?

38:46.498 --> 38:48.848
OK.

38:48.978 --> 38:54.810
And then he opens my legs.

38:54.941 --> 38:57.770
I... I...

40:32.168 --> 40:34.649
He's gone.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.346
You're crazy.

40:36.477 --> 40:38.697
Residents are advised to stay indoors

40:38.827 --> 40:40.699
and away from any windows.

40:40.829 --> 40:43.484
We have received reports that
many roads and bridges

40:43.615 --> 40:45.355
are completely flooded.

40:45.486 --> 40:47.749
The governor has declared a
state of emergency,

40:47.880 --> 40:49.795
and the National Guard
has been dispatched

40:49.925 --> 40:53.929
to assist local officials
with rescue and recovery procedures.

40:54.060 --> 40:56.323
The Sheriff's Office has asked
residents to remain...

42:09.309 --> 42:11.703
Hey.

42:16.272 --> 42:17.272
What's up?

42:29.938 --> 42:33.768
I thought we might get
a drink, have a little talk.

42:47.477 --> 42:48.477
Come on up.

42:52.047 --> 42:53.571
Why don't you take a seat?

42:57.183 --> 42:58.183
That one.

43:15.723 --> 43:23.723
You ever... you ever
think about your own death?

43:24.645 --> 43:25.645
Not lately.

43:28.170 --> 43:31.217
I think about mine every day.

43:31.347 --> 43:36.048
It forces me to have gratitude.

43:36.178 --> 43:40.139
That's something you
don't know about.

43:40.269 --> 43:43.533
I'm grateful.

43:43.664 --> 43:47.059
You've got a beautiful
young wife and daughter at home,

43:47.189 --> 43:48.669
and you're messing it all up.

43:51.759 --> 43:55.154
Besides, people only
know gratitude when they're faced

43:55.284 --> 43:58.505
with life and death choices.

43:58.636 --> 44:02.074
That's the real
tragedy of life...

44:02.204 --> 44:03.204
Unappreciation.

44:10.430 --> 44:12.475
So what'd you see
on the USS Stark?

44:16.523 --> 44:19.091
How'd you know I
was on that ship?

44:19.221 --> 44:23.182
You think I'd just
invite anybody into my home?

44:23.312 --> 44:25.575
Y'all watched it on the news.

44:25.706 --> 44:28.970
You saw some shit, didn't you,
Mr. Action Jackson?

44:37.849 --> 44:44.377
My career in Nam began
and ended when I was 17.

44:47.032 --> 44:49.251
Bullshit, that's the reason.

44:49.382 --> 44:54.082
I caught shrapnel in my
left knee from friendly fire.

44:56.955 --> 44:59.261
I was all set to go out
on my first mission,

44:59.392 --> 45:01.611
and some jackass boot
wasn't paying attention

45:01.742 --> 45:04.876
and let his grenade
go off during a drill.

45:05.006 --> 45:08.444
And I was the
only motherfucker who got hurt.

45:12.318 --> 45:14.407
Everybody else went out
on mission the next day,

45:14.537 --> 45:17.105
and I got sent home.

45:17.236 --> 45:17.932
I protested.

45:18.063 --> 45:20.892
I asked to go back.

45:21.022 --> 45:23.982
They weren't having it.

45:24.112 --> 45:26.636
That sucks.

45:26.767 --> 45:34.253
Two weeks later,
my entire squad,

45:34.383 --> 45:40.563
every single one of them,
got killed on mission

45:40.694 --> 45:41.694
just south of Da Nang.

45:47.962 --> 45:51.661
And I should have
been there with them.

45:51.792 --> 45:56.623
I should have died with them.

45:56.754 --> 45:59.147
Go out in a blaze of bullets.

46:02.890 --> 46:03.890
Pow!

46:09.854 --> 46:10.854
So what'd you see?

46:14.293 --> 46:16.948
Well...

46:17.078 --> 46:18.752
Are you gonna tell me
like we're old friends,

46:18.776 --> 46:20.536
or am I gonna have to
force it out of you?

46:20.560 --> 46:21.560
Come on.

46:25.434 --> 46:26.784
Like you saw on the news.

46:30.222 --> 46:34.095
On 17th May,
Iraqi bomber dropped a couple missiles,

46:34.226 --> 46:40.362
and it penetrated the hull,
ignited the fuel lines,

46:40.493 --> 46:46.412
and it spread
quickly throughout.

46:49.545 --> 46:53.158
37 dead, including
my buddy Carl.

46:59.773 --> 47:02.820
I tried to help him,
but... but... it...

47:06.911 --> 47:08.738
His body burned
beyond recognition.

47:14.701 --> 47:19.140
What did the United
States military offer

47:19.271 --> 47:22.013
you in return for your service?

47:22.143 --> 47:24.015
Nothing.

47:24.145 --> 47:26.756
Jack shit.

47:26.887 --> 47:29.890
They told us we were
the important ones

47:30.021 --> 47:34.199
when they shipped us off to war,
made us feel like somebody.

47:34.329 --> 47:37.985
And then when were turned, they spat on us

47:38.116 --> 47:41.467
and called us scumbag filth.

47:41.597 --> 47:47.908
This entire system is programmed
for the American youth

47:48.039 --> 47:52.304
to die so that the
blubbery old Washington

47:52.434 --> 47:55.960
fat cats can stay rich.

47:56.090 --> 47:58.397
That's all right.

47:58.527 --> 48:01.139
That's OK.

48:01.269 --> 48:08.059
'Cause this here, me and
you, this is destiny.

48:11.236 --> 48:12.236
Why's that?

48:23.204 --> 48:30.342
$20,000.

48:30.472 --> 48:34.041
Why are you showing it to me?

48:34.172 --> 48:36.261
It's what I'm gonna
pay you to kill my wife.

48:47.011 --> 48:48.577
You got a weird
sense of humor, man.

48:51.493 --> 48:54.540
Six months ago she was diagnosed

48:54.670 --> 48:56.977
with terminal blood
cancer, and there

48:57.108 --> 49:00.894
ain't no coming back from that.

49:01.025 --> 49:03.114
She's about to
start suffering real

49:03.244 --> 49:04.724
bad like you wouldn't believe.

49:04.854 --> 49:08.206
And I... I just...

49:08.336 --> 49:10.556
I'd do it myself, but I
haven't got the heart.

49:14.386 --> 49:15.953
I'll make it real easy for you.

49:20.566 --> 49:24.396
Son, you just cover
her mouth with it,

49:24.526 --> 49:25.875
and she'll be gone in minutes.

49:26.006 --> 49:30.228
You just,

49:30.358 --> 49:35.929
$20,000 would take care
of all your problems,

49:36.060 --> 49:40.064
including your sick kid.

49:40.194 --> 49:44.677
$20,000 would set up
your future real nice.

49:44.807 --> 49:47.462
It'd make your old
lady real happy.

49:52.990 --> 49:54.600
Please.

49:54.730 --> 49:56.036
Please.

49:56.167 --> 50:00.127
I just... I can't bear
to watch her suffer.

50:00.258 --> 50:01.432
I love her too damn much...

50:05.002 --> 50:07.569
Even though she does
drive me insane.

50:13.575 --> 50:14.575
Insane.

50:20.060 --> 50:22.715
I know you got this in you.

50:22.845 --> 50:24.586
I've been watching you.

50:28.112 --> 50:33.204
Let us do something
for each other the way

50:33.334 --> 50:39.384
the military didn't,
soldier to soldier.

50:39.514 --> 50:47.514
$20,000 all yours.

50:54.181 --> 50:55.181
All right.

51:01.623 --> 51:04.539
She won't feel a thing.

51:53.240 --> 52:01.240
Southern trees bear strange fruit.

52:05.600 --> 52:11.998
Blood on the leaves
and blood at the root.

52:15.480 --> 52:21.573
Black bodies swinging
in the Southern breeze.

52:25.446 --> 52:32.236
Strange fruit hanging
from the poplar trees.

52:41.984 --> 52:45.249
Ever heard of this song?

52:45.379 --> 52:48.730
"Strange Fruit," Billie Holiday.

52:48.861 --> 52:51.559
This song was banned for
its racial provocation

52:51.690 --> 52:54.171
against lynching.

52:54.301 --> 52:56.564
Ironically, it was
written by a white man.

53:04.790 --> 53:07.008
You gonna just stand
there like a tree in the woods?

53:12.580 --> 53:14.321
Fine.

53:14.452 --> 53:15.452
Suit yourself.

53:27.073 --> 53:28.466
You see this?

53:28.596 --> 53:32.209
When I was a little girl,
if I so much as sneezed

53:32.339 --> 53:35.124
at the dinner table,
my mama would pick up her fork

53:35.255 --> 53:36.256
and stab me with it.

53:40.391 --> 53:42.044
We all had messed-up childhoods.

53:45.439 --> 53:48.573
What was yours like?

53:48.703 --> 53:49.530
Doesn't matter.

53:49.661 --> 53:52.316
Of course it matters.

53:52.446 --> 53:54.056
Why?

53:54.187 --> 53:55.449
'Cause I want to know.

53:58.887 --> 54:02.021
But why do you care?

54:02.151 --> 54:05.633
'Cause I can see your sadness.

54:09.420 --> 54:12.553
I ain't sad.

54:12.684 --> 54:13.728
Yeah?

54:13.859 --> 54:14.859
Yeah.

54:17.384 --> 54:19.125
I wouldn't judge you if you was.

54:28.526 --> 54:30.484
There ain't much to say.

54:30.615 --> 54:33.531
No.

54:33.661 --> 54:35.489
Tell me about your mama.

54:42.670 --> 54:45.064
She died in a boating
accident when I was six.

54:47.153 --> 54:48.415
And your daddy?

54:52.463 --> 54:54.682
My dad blamed us for it.

54:54.813 --> 54:59.513
He drank himself into a coma...
Literally.

54:59.644 --> 55:00.818
He's still in the hospital.

55:03.300 --> 55:05.954
Yeah.

55:06.085 --> 55:07.085
Not much to say.

55:15.964 --> 55:16.964
What about you?

55:20.360 --> 55:21.361
Why are you so sad?

55:25.887 --> 55:26.887
I won't bore you.

55:30.283 --> 55:32.677
There ain't enough
whiskey in the world

55:32.807 --> 55:34.374
to relieve my sadness.

55:49.041 --> 55:52.392
I'm sorry about your parents.

55:52.523 --> 55:53.523
Don't be.

55:57.266 --> 55:58.266
It is what it is.

56:16.155 --> 56:18.375
With her husband in
the next room thinking

56:18.505 --> 56:20.899
you were gonna kill her.

56:21.029 --> 56:24.468
You expect me to believe you
didn't commit murder?

56:24.598 --> 56:27.035
With morals like that?

56:27.166 --> 56:28.646
I know.

56:28.776 --> 56:31.692
The stupid shit I
done in my life.

56:31.823 --> 56:33.651
All right, I get that.

56:33.781 --> 56:35.783
But it'd been six months
since my wife and I...

56:40.048 --> 56:46.794
And Fancy... she's
crazy, all right,

56:46.925 --> 56:50.668
but she is sexier than hell.

56:50.798 --> 56:53.018
She softened me up with
all that emotional shit,

56:53.148 --> 56:57.892
and I guess I just always had
a taste for danger.

56:59.024 --> 56:59.764
That's not dangerous, son.

56:59.894 --> 57:01.766
That's a death wish.

57:01.896 --> 57:04.899
I felt bad for her.

57:05.030 --> 57:07.815
'Cause of her illness?

57:07.946 --> 57:10.862
No, it was something else.

57:10.992 --> 57:18.992
Like she, has this hole in
her, and she can't fill it.

57:21.786 --> 57:23.396
Just let it go.

57:23.527 --> 57:26.225
You let it go, you set yourself free
from this wicked burden

57:26.355 --> 57:29.924
of guilt and shame you
got locked up inside.

57:30.055 --> 57:31.796
It's OK.

57:31.926 --> 57:33.972
Let it go.

57:34.102 --> 57:37.497
I didn't do anything.

57:37.628 --> 57:39.891
You want to go on lying to
yourself over and over

57:40.021 --> 57:41.108
again, that's fine by me.

57:41.153 --> 57:42.371
I got all day.

57:42.502 --> 57:44.504
You don't get it.

57:44.635 --> 57:45.960
At this point, I was
just trying to figure

57:45.984 --> 57:47.986
out a way to survive the night.

57:48.116 --> 57:51.250
Just how'd you do that?

57:51.380 --> 57:53.557
Hitting up against each other.

58:27.591 --> 58:29.941
What do we have here?

58:30.071 --> 58:32.944
It's... you're not...

58:33.074 --> 58:36.425
You're not, like...
Like, sick, right?

58:36.556 --> 58:37.862
Sick?

58:37.992 --> 58:41.387
Yeah, like... Like blood cancer?

58:41.518 --> 58:43.041
No.

58:43.171 --> 58:46.392
Now, why would you say that?

58:46.523 --> 58:50.091
What the hell did he tell you?

58:50.222 --> 58:52.006
He asked me to kill you.

59:05.890 --> 59:08.240
Thank you for telling me.

59:08.370 --> 59:09.894
I'm gonna take care of this.

59:12.940 --> 59:15.290
If he finds out that I talked to
you, he might...

59:15.421 --> 59:19.643
No, no, no, no, I'm
not gonna say a word.

59:19.773 --> 59:21.732
I know how Walter works.

59:21.862 --> 59:23.124
He's got a lot of guns.

59:23.255 --> 59:24.429
You gonna have to trust me.

01:00:05.689 --> 01:00:06.994
Walt?

01:00:07.125 --> 01:00:09.518
Yeah?

01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:10.998
Can we talk?

01:00:14.132 --> 01:00:17.048
What's up?

01:00:17.178 --> 01:00:20.051
I think you and I need to come to
a new place of understanding

01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:21.181
with each other.

01:00:23.532 --> 01:00:25.839
What does that mean?

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:28.537
Well, that means we're
living in the past.

01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:31.234
Now we've got all this anger and
resentment with each other.

01:00:36.937 --> 01:00:40.288
You love me.

01:00:40.419 --> 01:00:41.419
I truly believe that.

01:00:44.858 --> 01:00:46.817
Let's just try and
let all that go.

01:00:51.996 --> 01:00:54.607
How?

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:55.738
Forgiveness.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:01.614
Forgiveness?

01:01:01.745 --> 01:01:04.878
I've been hard on you.

01:01:05.009 --> 01:01:09.578
And I just don't have the energy
to fight anymore, baby.

01:01:09.709 --> 01:01:11.536
You and I, we get so
angry, we start saying

01:01:11.624 --> 01:01:13.060
things we don't really mean.

01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:15.759
Yeah.

01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:17.848
Yeah, I guess so.

01:01:17.978 --> 01:01:20.546
I'm tired, baby.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:24.768
I can't keep up with all
this wretched bitterness anymore.

01:01:24.898 --> 01:01:26.639
I want things to be
the way they were.

01:01:32.253 --> 01:01:35.126
Me too.

01:01:35.256 --> 01:01:38.651
I got nothing but love for
you, my beautiful man.

01:01:51.185 --> 01:01:52.709
You see that shit?

01:01:52.839 --> 01:01:54.145
Did you see that shit?

01:01:57.757 --> 01:02:01.021
This is your fault.
See what you did?

01:02:01.152 --> 01:02:02.849
You made me hit a woman.

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.722
'Cause you couldn't
finish the job.

01:02:05.852 --> 01:02:08.420
Well, you're gonna
finish it now.

01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:09.421
Come on.

01:02:09.551 --> 01:02:10.030
All right.

01:02:10.161 --> 01:02:10.944
OK.

01:02:11.075 --> 01:02:12.206
Where's that poison?

01:02:12.337 --> 01:02:13.488
I still got it.
It's right in my pocket.

01:02:13.512 --> 01:02:14.382
What the fuck are
you waiting for?

01:02:14.513 --> 01:02:15.862
Take it out.

01:02:15.993 --> 01:02:16.993
Open it up.

01:02:17.081 --> 01:02:17.777
OK.

01:02:17.908 --> 01:02:20.475
Pour it on the rag.

01:02:20.606 --> 01:02:21.955
Pour it on the rag!

01:02:25.132 --> 01:02:27.526
Cover her mouth with it.

01:02:27.656 --> 01:02:29.286
You just told her a second
ago you loved her.

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:30.659
Cover her mouth.

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:32.618
You've been married
for 15 years, man.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.141
Think about that.

01:02:35.273 --> 01:02:36.404
Cover her mouth!

01:02:46.066 --> 01:02:48.852
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

01:02:48.982 --> 01:02:49.982
Yes.

01:03:55.179 --> 01:03:56.833
You kicked my ass.

01:03:56.963 --> 01:03:57.963
Worthy warrior.

01:04:00.488 --> 01:04:03.230
Shoot me.

01:04:03.361 --> 01:04:05.319
Slay me.

01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:06.450
I'm ready.

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:12.631
That ain't gonna
happen, jarhead.

01:04:19.116 --> 01:04:19.856
You all right?

01:04:19.986 --> 01:04:22.206
My head's pounding.

01:04:22.336 --> 01:04:25.470
Yeah, well, you're safe now.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.300
Just take it easy.

01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:31.998
Look, I think I'd rather be in
a hurricane than this shit,

01:04:32.129 --> 01:04:33.217
so, where are the keys?

01:04:33.347 --> 01:04:34.696
Take me with you.

01:04:34.827 --> 01:04:36.873
I can't stay either.

01:04:37.003 --> 01:04:38.135
Please.

01:04:38.265 --> 01:04:39.787
Let's just go
somewhere, you and me.

01:04:40.572 --> 01:04:42.356
You two gonna run off together?

01:04:43.923 --> 01:04:46.056
Go ahead and take her.

01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:49.320
She's all yours.

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:52.584
But I'll tell you this.

01:04:52.714 --> 01:04:59.025
She got a dark side...
Darker than hell.

01:04:59.156 --> 01:05:00.766
Shut your mouth.

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:03.638
If you love him so much,
why don't you tell him?

01:05:03.769 --> 01:05:05.249
What's he talking about?

01:05:05.379 --> 01:05:06.380
Nothing.

01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:09.253
I bet he'd just love to hear all

01:05:09.383 --> 01:05:11.908
about your dirty little secret.

01:05:15.955 --> 01:05:17.043
What's he going on about?

01:05:17.174 --> 01:05:17.739
Nothing, honey.

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:19.306
Just help me up.

01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:26.357
What are you doing?

01:05:26.487 --> 01:05:31.231
Just take me right here,
right here in front of him.

01:05:31.362 --> 01:05:33.320
Let's make that son
of a bitch squirm.

01:05:36.454 --> 01:05:40.066
I'll look him right in
the eyes while you make me cum.

01:05:40.197 --> 01:05:42.068
No, no, no.

01:05:42.199 --> 01:05:42.764
Stop.

01:05:42.895 --> 01:05:44.505
He's a monster.

01:05:44.636 --> 01:05:45.942
You know that, you've seen it.

01:05:46.072 --> 01:05:49.162
You cannot leave
me here with him.

01:05:49.293 --> 01:05:51.599
I'm taking an even 200
for the fence, asshole.

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:53.297
You didn't finish it.

01:05:53.427 --> 01:05:57.083
Yeah, well, I
figured I earned it

01:05:57.214 --> 01:05:58.519
putting up with your bullshit.

01:06:01.261 --> 01:06:04.134
Hey, soldier.

01:06:04.264 --> 01:06:09.487
You better kill me now,
or I'll be coming for you.

01:06:09.617 --> 01:06:11.489
That's a promise.

01:06:11.619 --> 01:06:14.883
You and your whole family.

01:06:21.934 --> 01:06:23.501
Where are the car keys?

01:06:23.631 --> 01:06:24.415
They're right here.

01:06:24.545 --> 01:06:25.545
I got 'em.

01:06:29.898 --> 01:06:30.725
Ready?

01:06:30.856 --> 01:06:32.684
Yeah.

01:06:32.814 --> 01:06:36.122
Before you two love
birds escape reality together,

01:06:36.253 --> 01:06:38.429
there's something you
should know, Buddy.

01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:41.693
You like dangerous
things, don't you?

01:06:41.823 --> 01:06:43.477
Have a look in our basement.

01:06:45.566 --> 01:06:47.786
You're gonna love it.

01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:53.270
What's down there?

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:56.055
You're gonna love it!

01:06:56.186 --> 01:06:58.318
Yeah!

01:06:58.449 --> 01:06:59.450
Let's just go.

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.756
No.

01:07:01.887 --> 01:07:04.455
Keys are right
here in my pocket.

01:07:04.585 --> 01:07:06.326
Come and get 'em.

01:07:06.457 --> 01:07:10.722
See for yourself what kind
of woman you want to hook up with.

01:07:10.852 --> 01:07:13.638
You think I got a dark side.

01:07:13.768 --> 01:07:18.121
You have no idea.

01:07:18.251 --> 01:07:22.560
God damn you.

01:07:28.696 --> 01:07:32.048
Listen to me, do
not go down there.

01:07:32.178 --> 01:07:33.745
Why not?

01:07:33.875 --> 01:07:36.313
There are things
down there that...

01:07:36.443 --> 01:07:38.271
Please.

01:07:38.402 --> 01:07:40.360
Don't let him toy with
your mind like this.

01:07:40.491 --> 01:07:44.060
You're smarter than that.

01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:46.627
What are you hiding?

01:07:46.758 --> 01:07:49.152
Nothing.

01:07:49.282 --> 01:07:52.155
Now, come on...
You let go of me.

01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:15.481
Yeah!

01:08:37.548 --> 01:08:38.984
Did you get that little fuck?

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:41.247
That little shit weasel fuck.

01:08:41.377 --> 01:08:42.944
This is all your fault.

01:08:43.075 --> 01:08:44.642
My fault?

01:08:44.772 --> 01:08:46.662
You're the one who kept
running your mouth about secrets.

01:08:46.687 --> 01:08:49.341
Yeah.

01:08:49.473 --> 01:08:53.216
Did you have to stab me so hard?

01:08:53.345 --> 01:08:54.912
He didn't go in the
basement, did he?

01:08:54.956 --> 01:08:56.261
No.

01:08:56.393 --> 01:08:58.786
All right, light...
Light some candles.

01:09:28.816 --> 01:09:30.166
You OK?

01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:37.173
What did they do to you?

01:09:37.303 --> 01:09:38.609
What... what's... what's...

01:09:45.268 --> 01:09:47.573
What's that?

01:09:58.672 --> 01:10:02.589
Help me.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.025
Yeah, I will.

01:10:04.156 --> 01:10:06.027
I promise you I will.

01:10:07.681 --> 01:10:11.903
How long you been in here?

01:10:12.033 --> 01:10:13.033
Days.

01:10:17.604 --> 01:10:18.997
What?

01:10:19.127 --> 01:10:19.998
What, now?

01:10:20.128 --> 01:10:21.434
What... what is it?

01:10:26.613 --> 01:10:29.442
There's more of us.

01:11:26.499 --> 01:11:28.849
Keep an eye on the front door.

01:12:07.932 --> 01:12:11.283
Fight back!

01:13:58.521 --> 01:14:01.306
I want to talk to a lawyer.

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.743
I want... I...
I want my phone call.

01:14:03.874 --> 01:14:05.963
What you think
this is, New York?

01:14:06.093 --> 01:14:07.704
DC?

01:14:07.834 --> 01:14:11.708
You're in Grand Isle, son.

01:14:11.838 --> 01:14:15.625
We don't subscribe to
that big city nonsense.

01:14:15.755 --> 01:14:16.755
I'm sorry, your honor.

01:14:16.843 --> 01:14:18.062
Yeah, well, the power's out.

01:14:18.192 --> 01:14:19.474
It seemed our poor
little suspect,

01:14:19.498 --> 01:14:21.805
he just couldn't
make his phone call.

01:14:21.935 --> 01:14:26.418
He was just a boy with a
family you ripped him away from.

01:14:26.549 --> 01:14:29.726
I didn't... will you...
Will you just send an officer

01:14:29.856 --> 01:14:31.467
to check out that basement?

01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:34.687
You will find some
crazy, horrendous shit.

01:14:34.818 --> 01:14:36.254
I put my life on it.

01:14:36.384 --> 01:14:38.232
And why are you so fascinated
with that basement?

01:14:38.256 --> 01:14:40.432
The way they were
talking about it.

01:14:40.563 --> 01:14:43.391
Who puts three bolt locks on
abasement door, has a kid hooked

01:14:43.522 --> 01:14:46.090
up to an IV clutching a
rag with... with Chinese

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:48.179
or... or Japanese letters on it?

01:14:48.309 --> 01:14:50.486
All right, now you're
just making shit up.

01:14:50.616 --> 01:14:52.488
You know what?

01:14:52.618 --> 01:14:53.880
I've been patient.

01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:55.273
I've been kind.

01:14:55.403 --> 01:14:56.666
But I'm done.

01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:06.676
Here's my take on it, you
little lying, little motherfucker.

01:15:06.806 --> 01:15:11.158
While you were in service,
you developed a taste for violence.

01:15:11.289 --> 01:15:12.072
You came home.

01:15:12.203 --> 01:15:13.073
You found you a girl.

01:15:13.204 --> 01:15:14.684
You had a kid.

01:15:14.814 --> 01:15:17.774
But that domestic life wasn't
what you'd hoped for.

01:15:17.904 --> 01:15:22.518
Then you bumped into
an ex-Marine who pissed you off.

01:15:22.648 --> 01:15:25.477
You boned his wife,
and then you killed

01:15:25.608 --> 01:15:27.847
a teenager who just happened to
be in the wrong place

01:15:27.871 --> 01:15:28.871
at the wrong time.

01:15:32.745 --> 01:15:34.791
I know I'm right.

01:15:39.665 --> 01:15:44.365
As I see it,
there ain't nothing in the way of you

01:15:44.496 --> 01:15:48.587
frying in the electric chair.

01:15:48.718 --> 01:15:51.068
I'm innocent.

01:15:51.198 --> 01:15:56.552
You gonna confess your sins to
me, one way or another.

01:15:58.945 --> 01:15:59.990
What?

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.120
His wife is here.

01:16:03.863 --> 01:16:07.824
Well, let's show her in.

01:16:07.954 --> 01:16:08.781
In here?

01:16:08.912 --> 01:16:10.566
Sure, why not?

01:16:10.696 --> 01:16:12.456
Sure she gonna want to
have a chance to give

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.524
him a piece of her mind.

01:16:23.927 --> 01:16:25.276
Yeah.

01:16:25.406 --> 01:16:26.798
Come in and talk
to your husband.

01:16:29.541 --> 01:16:30.846
Find out what he's been up to.

01:16:42.815 --> 01:16:45.165
How'd you find me?

01:16:45.296 --> 01:16:48.995
I called the police when
you didn't come home.

01:16:49.126 --> 01:16:51.389
What in the hell
happened to you?

01:16:54.871 --> 01:16:58.831
Some kid's dead, and
they think I did it.

01:16:58.962 --> 01:17:01.704
You?

01:17:01.834 --> 01:17:02.834
Up for murder?

01:17:06.665 --> 01:17:09.102
I didn't do it.

01:17:09.233 --> 01:17:10.495
I swear.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:11.452
You have to believe me.

01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:13.846
I mean, you know me.

01:17:13.977 --> 01:17:16.501
I don't know what to believe.

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:19.939
What are they telling me about
some woman named Fancy?

01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:22.638
Buddy, do you know her?

01:17:25.423 --> 01:17:26.423
Do you know her?

01:17:31.342 --> 01:17:33.300
Why did that officer
tell me you...

01:17:36.434 --> 01:17:37.870
You had an affair with her?

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:41.656
Baby.

01:17:44.747 --> 01:17:48.707
What is happening, Buddy?

01:17:48.838 --> 01:17:56.193
I love you, and,
I'll explain all this, all right?

01:17:56.323 --> 01:17:58.412
I promise.

01:17:58.543 --> 01:18:00.980
Bit right now you gotta
help me get out of here.

01:18:01.111 --> 01:18:02.852
They're gonna kill
me, for Christ's sake.

01:18:07.726 --> 01:18:09.162
If I may, sir, I...

01:18:09.293 --> 01:18:11.469
I think he may be
on to something.

01:18:11.599 --> 01:18:12.688
What you talking about?

01:18:12.818 --> 01:18:14.733
It's probably nothing, but, I

01:18:14.864 --> 01:18:17.475
remember seeing a
newspaper headline

01:18:17.605 --> 01:18:23.176
with a picture of a
teenage girl, Monica Fujima.

01:18:23.307 --> 01:18:28.181
She was wearing a red silk
dress with Japanese writing on it.

01:18:28.312 --> 01:18:30.575
She's still missing, sir.

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:33.447
Son of a bitch.

01:18:33.578 --> 01:18:34.971
Bring that file with you.

01:18:37.843 --> 01:18:38.365
Lisa.

01:18:38.496 --> 01:18:40.280
Lisa, wait.

01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:41.629
Is this what you saw?

01:18:45.285 --> 01:18:46.460
Yeah.

01:18:46.591 --> 01:18:50.247
You're 1,000% sure?

01:18:50.377 --> 01:18:51.682
Get Judge Warren on the phone.

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:52.878
We're gonna need
a search warrant.

01:18:52.902 --> 01:18:54.033
Can I go home?

01:18:54.164 --> 01:18:55.164
Not just yet.

01:19:52.526 --> 01:19:53.526
Good day, officers.

01:19:53.614 --> 01:19:54.920
What can I do for you?

01:19:55.051 --> 01:19:57.053
This here's a search warrant.

01:19:57.183 --> 01:19:58.639
We have reason to believe that you might be

01:19:58.663 --> 01:20:00.796
performing illegal activities.

01:20:00.926 --> 01:20:03.624
Illegal activities?

01:20:03.755 --> 01:20:05.713
What happened to your face?

01:20:05.844 --> 01:20:07.150
I tell you.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:10.240
It was... power went out
during the hurricane.

01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:13.199
Tripped over the stairs,
landed right on my face.

01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:14.766
Cut my hand on a broken window.

01:20:14.897 --> 01:20:16.246
It was a rough night.

01:20:16.376 --> 01:20:17.116
But, please, by all means,
come... come on in.

01:20:17.247 --> 01:20:18.247
Have a look.

01:20:24.341 --> 01:20:26.125
All right, go ahead
and search the place.

01:20:26.256 --> 01:20:28.693
Officer Gregg and I will keep
the Franklins company.

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:31.827
I... I believe you might
know my wife, Fancy.

01:20:31.957 --> 01:20:32.957
Good morning, officers.

01:20:42.968 --> 01:20:44.840
Now, can I offer
you some ice tea?

01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:50.410
No, ma'am,
but we appreciate your hospitality.

01:20:50.541 --> 01:20:52.151
I don't imagine
bourbon's appropriate.

01:21:58.391 --> 01:21:59.784
Keep an eye on them.

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.239
Get me out of here!

01:23:07.243 --> 01:23:07.808
It's over.

01:23:07.939 --> 01:23:08.939
We gotta run.

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:10.420
We're not leaving this house.

01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:12.137
You almost had to
run off with that boy.

01:23:12.161 --> 01:23:14.076
Now all of a sudden
you want to stay?

01:23:14.206 --> 01:23:14.946
That was then.

01:23:15.077 --> 01:23:16.252
You want to go to jail?

01:23:16.382 --> 01:23:17.253
Is that what you want?

01:23:17.383 --> 01:23:18.994
No, but...

01:23:19.124 --> 01:23:22.954
You are not dragging me
into this twisted shit of yours.

01:23:23.085 --> 01:23:24.912
I wanted to expand our family.

01:23:25.043 --> 01:23:26.392
This is on you.

01:23:26.523 --> 01:23:28.481
Officer, my cat is
stuck up in the tree.

01:23:28.612 --> 01:23:30.440
Would you shoot him down for me?

01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:31.789
What?

01:23:31.919 --> 01:23:33.332
I said my cat is
stuck up in a tree.

01:23:33.356 --> 01:23:35.532
Would you shoot him down for me?

01:23:52.723 --> 01:23:55.117
Walter!

01:23:55.247 --> 01:23:56.814
Walter!

01:23:56.944 --> 01:23:58.772
Walter, no!

01:23:58.903 --> 01:23:59.903
No!

01:24:04.952 --> 01:24:05.431
No!

01:24:05.562 --> 01:24:06.562
No!

01:24:19.532 --> 01:24:20.532
God dammit.

01:24:29.542 --> 01:24:30.542
You can go.

01:24:34.852 --> 01:24:36.114
What'd you find?

01:24:40.379 --> 01:24:41.641
Well, come on.

01:24:41.772 --> 01:24:43.165
It's my info that got you there.

01:24:43.295 --> 01:24:45.382
The least you could do
is tell me what you found.

01:24:47.734 --> 01:24:49.084
A nightmare.

01:24:55.177 --> 01:24:56.482
Go on home.

01:25:17.895 --> 01:25:18.896
What are you doing?

01:25:19.026 --> 01:25:21.377
Going to my sister's.

01:25:21.507 --> 01:25:22.919
Come on, now, let's
talk about this...

01:25:22.943 --> 01:25:25.685
Don't call me.

01:25:25.816 --> 01:25:27.470
Lisa, please don't.

01:25:37.393 --> 01:25:39.308
It's been two weeks since
Grand Isle suffered

01:25:39.438 --> 01:25:42.441
the area's worst
hurricane in 17 years,

01:25:42.572 --> 01:25:45.270
with millions of dollars
in damage caused to businesses

01:25:45.401 --> 01:25:47.403
and countless homes destroyed.

01:25:47.533 --> 01:25:49.753
Some people are still
unaccounted for,

01:25:49.883 --> 01:25:52.103
but emergency services
are doing their best

01:25:52.234 --> 01:25:54.671
to reach those in need.

01:25:54.801 --> 01:25:56.673
And in other news,
the manhunt continues

01:25:56.803 --> 01:25:58.849
for Walter Franklin,
the main suspect

01:25:58.979 --> 01:26:01.417
accused of the recent
teenage abductions.

01:27:33.813 --> 01:27:36.207
How are you holding up, Buddy?

01:27:36.338 --> 01:27:38.383
Miss my girls.

01:27:38.514 --> 01:27:39.514
Time heals all wounds.

01:27:45.477 --> 01:27:47.000
Yeah, that is what they've said.

01:27:55.095 --> 01:27:57.010
Tadpole.

01:27:57.141 --> 01:27:58.141
Call the cops.

01:28:02.015 --> 01:28:04.496
How you feeling, Buddy?

01:28:04.627 --> 01:28:05.627
You excited?

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.459
Feeling a bit on the
other side of that.

01:28:11.938 --> 01:28:15.899
Been thinking about
your own death?

01:28:16.029 --> 01:28:17.030
Sure have.

01:28:17.161 --> 01:28:19.511
Outstanding, soldier.

01:28:19.642 --> 01:28:23.385
What conclusions have you drawn?

01:28:23.515 --> 01:28:25.188
Every day away from
my wife and my child

01:28:25.212 --> 01:28:28.781
is its own sort of hell.

01:28:28.912 --> 01:28:33.133
Kind of like waking
up every morning

01:28:33.264 --> 01:28:35.614
knowing if you were overseas
with your squad,

01:28:35.745 --> 01:28:39.836
maybe you could have
helped save them?

01:28:39.966 --> 01:28:44.362
Walter, I understand what you're

01:28:44.493 --> 01:28:46.669
going through, all right?

01:28:46.799 --> 01:28:49.454
Tell me, how do you relate?

01:28:49.585 --> 01:28:50.779
Don't do this now, all right?

01:28:50.803 --> 01:28:51.500
Let her go.

01:28:51.630 --> 01:28:53.110
No, no, no, no, no.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.634
You exposed our little secret.

01:28:55.765 --> 01:28:58.202
Now it's your turn.

01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:00.378
I don't have any secrets.

01:29:01.466 --> 01:29:02.815
Fuck!

01:29:02.946 --> 01:29:04.643
Something on that
ship, wasn't it?

01:29:17.177 --> 01:29:20.833
I said I tried to
help out my friend Carl.

01:29:24.663 --> 01:29:25.663
That was a lie.

01:29:29.929 --> 01:29:34.934
I saw him burning
up on the ground,

01:29:35.065 --> 01:29:36.675
writhing around, and... and...

01:29:44.770 --> 01:29:45.770
I ran.

01:29:50.254 --> 01:29:53.475
Well, you actually got tested
and proved to yourself

01:29:53.605 --> 01:29:54.998
that you're a coward.

01:29:55.128 --> 01:29:56.128
Shit.

01:29:58.436 --> 01:30:03.310
Just when I thought we might have
had something in common.

01:30:03.441 --> 01:30:04.441
I guess not.

01:30:13.843 --> 01:30:15.584
All right, get
over here, tadpole.

01:30:19.457 --> 01:30:20.457
Come on.

01:30:39.216 --> 01:30:44.264
Hey, Walt. What
you aiming for here?

01:30:44.395 --> 01:30:45.395
I have a demand.

01:30:48.268 --> 01:30:49.268
Go ahead.

01:30:51.881 --> 01:30:53.448
Where's my baby girl?

01:30:53.578 --> 01:30:55.101
Where's Fancy?

01:30:55.232 --> 01:30:57.713
I want her released.

01:30:57.843 --> 01:31:00.455
They put her in a
locked down mental facility.

01:31:00.585 --> 01:31:02.761
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't get her released.

01:31:09.333 --> 01:31:14.773
Well, then, you'd
best get ready.

01:31:14.904 --> 01:31:15.992
Shit's about to get ugly.

01:31:16.122 --> 01:31:18.342
Now, hold on, Walter.

01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:20.562
What would your
fellow Marines say?

01:31:20.692 --> 01:31:21.800
You think they'd condone this?

01:31:21.824 --> 01:31:24.522
Well, fuck yeah, they would.

01:31:24.653 --> 01:31:30.093
This here is a sacrifice
against a system

01:31:30.223 --> 01:31:34.140
that doesn't give a shit about
me or my fellow Marines.

01:31:34.271 --> 01:31:37.840
Hell, we could talk
this out over a beer.

01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:40.016
Please let Buddy
and his family go.

01:31:40.146 --> 01:31:42.845
I'm done talking, George.

01:31:42.975 --> 01:31:45.151
And I sure as hell
am done drinking.

01:31:57.990 --> 01:32:03.735
Walter P. Franklin of the 1st
Battalion 10th Marines.

01:32:03.866 --> 01:32:04.866
Walter, don't.

01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:07.913
Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

01:32:08.044 --> 01:32:09.219
Walter, don't do it.

01:32:09.349 --> 01:32:10.829
Gunslingers signing out!

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:11.960
Walter, no!

01:32:13.092 --> 01:32:14.745
Get down, get down,
get down, get down!

01:33:04.056 --> 01:33:05.056
Hi.

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:10.584
Hey.

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:17.592
We got a lot of
work on, I get that.

01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:23.030
Maybe let's just take things
one day at a time.

01:33:26.035 --> 01:33:27.035
Let me see her.

01:33:41.572 --> 01:33:43.182
Local authorities

01:33:43.313 --> 01:33:46.359
have informed us that Walter
and Fancy Mae Franklin are reported

01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:49.232
to have held several
young teens in their basement

01:33:49.362 --> 01:33:52.148
and forced them to have babies
against their will.

01:33:52.278 --> 01:33:53.584
You're the most adorable

01:33:53.715 --> 01:33:55.586
little girl I've ever seen.

01:33:55.717 --> 01:33:57.109
Young girls, both age seven,

01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.503
were found emaciated
and barely alive.

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:01.287
Ever since I was a little girl,

01:34:01.418 --> 01:34:04.900
I have always wanted
a huge family.

01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:06.510
In these uncertain times,

01:34:06.641 --> 01:34:08.555
we must all be extra vigilant.

01:34:08.686 --> 01:34:12.472
I can't have one... Medically.

01:34:12.603 --> 01:34:14.015
We may think we know our neighbors,

01:34:14.039 --> 01:34:15.867
but maybe we don't.

01:34:18.827 --> 01:34:21.438
There are always other measures.

01:34:57.430 --> 01:35:04.046
Far away, I seek a life of stone

01:35:04.176 --> 01:35:07.484
as they course
through the wilds.

01:35:10.617 --> 01:35:15.448
Take in the smoke
of something new

01:35:15.579 --> 01:35:20.845
that's stones your heart,
your soul, your mind.

01:35:24.022 --> 01:35:32.022
Bank on a lie that always kept you
going, for some reason

01:35:33.902 --> 01:35:38.297
don't work anymore.

01:35:38.428 --> 01:35:44.608
Swim for the shallows to
find yourself drowning,

01:35:44.739 --> 01:35:48.612
stuck in the mud all alone.

01:36:21.688 --> 01:36:29.044
To the touch, you've gone cold,
hold still and brood.

01:36:29.174 --> 01:36:36.007
And your legs
don't work anymore.

01:36:36.138 --> 01:36:41.534
Try to run, forgotten
how to move.

01:36:41.665 --> 01:36:45.495
Still going, going
till you're gone.

01:36:49.673 --> 01:36:57.673
Bank on a lie that always kept you
showing, for some reason

01:36:58.334 --> 01:37:01.554
don't cut it anymore.
