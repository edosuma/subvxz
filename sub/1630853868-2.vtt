WEBVTT

00:20.166 --> 00:22.291
I heard voices raised in prayer,

00:23.583 --> 00:24.750
and so I've come.

00:25.708 --> 00:29.541
Goddess, I am Mylur,
Captain of the Dark Moon Order.

00:29.625 --> 00:33.208
I felt Selemene pass, but then I felt you.

00:33.291 --> 00:34.666
I don't understand.

00:34.750 --> 00:40.333
Selemene, Mene, these are only names.
We do not worship names.

00:40.416 --> 00:44.791
We worship the night. We worship shadow.
We love her together.

00:45.750 --> 00:50.208
The Dark Moon has passed.
Today, a new moon rises.

00:50.291 --> 00:54.333
Let the world know there is safety here,
protected by the New Moon Order.

00:55.583 --> 00:57.458
Open the Nightsilver Woods.

01:54.041 --> 01:56.500
Davion. Davion, wake up.

01:56.583 --> 01:59.125
-He looks dead.
-Shake it off, kid.

01:59.208 --> 02:01.166
Davion, you okay?

02:02.625 --> 02:05.875
-Remember that night in Weeping Rose?
-Yeah.

02:05.958 --> 02:07.541
Remember the next day?

02:08.208 --> 02:09.291
Oh, ouch.

02:09.375 --> 02:13.291
Foulfell shares
the same structure as the rest of reality.

02:13.375 --> 02:16.375
It still requires light,
gravity, substance.

02:16.958 --> 02:19.083
This is why we can get in.

02:19.166 --> 02:22.125
This is how God Empress Mirana
can get us out.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.625
Crazy, stupid.

02:26.375 --> 02:29.208
-Apparently, it's what I do, too.
-I'm living proof.

02:31.833 --> 02:33.500
Not you.

02:33.583 --> 02:35.958
No. No, I'm… I'm coming with you.

02:36.041 --> 02:40.708
We may go there and die.
Or we may win, but still die.

02:40.791 --> 02:43.541
I've earned this.
What more do I have to prove?

02:43.625 --> 02:44.625
Nothing.

02:44.708 --> 02:47.208
You know everything there is to know
about dragons.

02:47.291 --> 02:49.458
You know the traditions of Dragon Hold.

02:49.541 --> 02:54.041
You learned the secrets of the Forge.
We can't afford to lose that.

02:54.125 --> 02:55.708
-Well, there's--
-Father.

02:55.791 --> 02:57.500
What? Father?

02:58.250 --> 03:01.416
Me? But I'm… I'm just a--

03:01.500 --> 03:07.125
It's not about who's strongest or oldest,
or who killed the most wyrmlings.

03:07.208 --> 03:09.291
It's about who's best equipped
to teach and lead

03:09.375 --> 03:12.208
the next generation of Dragon Knights.

03:16.708 --> 03:20.375
So, when you come back,
I get to tell you what to do?

03:20.458 --> 03:21.833
No.

03:22.625 --> 03:24.375
When you're ready, Your Majesty,

03:24.458 --> 03:27.833
I will reach into your mind
and provide our destination.

03:29.458 --> 03:31.541
You need to only think it,
and we will travel.

03:32.125 --> 03:33.208
I'm ready.

03:33.291 --> 03:34.291
A warning.

03:34.375 --> 03:37.916
Foulfell is unlike
anything you've experienced.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.000
It's a prison
where demons consign their own

03:41.083 --> 03:44.250
to drive them mad
with their darkest regrets.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.375
Didn't do much to Terrorblade.

03:46.458 --> 03:50.541
The demons erred.
Terrorblade is incapable of regret.

03:51.208 --> 03:52.666
Prepare yourselves.

03:52.750 --> 03:56.083
Our enemy awaits in the hell of Hells.

04:01.833 --> 04:03.791
-<i>I caused all of this.</i>
-<i>No. No, it can't be.</i>

04:03.875 --> 04:06.083
-<i>I thought I had no choice.</i>
-<i>I wanted to change my fate.</i>

04:12.666 --> 04:14.250
No, no, no. No, it can't be.

04:18.791 --> 04:19.625
No.

04:19.708 --> 04:21.958
Davi, you shouldn't be out.

04:22.583 --> 04:26.000
Find your mother. Find shelter. Go.

04:28.250 --> 04:30.875
Davi, go. Run!

04:34.291 --> 04:35.291
Papa.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.125
You killed us all.

04:54.625 --> 04:56.666
My pod, my family.

04:58.041 --> 05:00.166
Adara had only love in her heart.

05:00.666 --> 05:03.541
Idwal could always bring
a smile to your face.

05:04.083 --> 05:05.583
You killed us all.

05:06.791 --> 05:08.875
I only did as my goddess commanded.

05:08.958 --> 05:11.291
You were sent
to recover the lotuses,

05:11.375 --> 05:13.916
but you chose to murder us in our sleep.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.416
The prophecy.
I thought, I thought I had no choice.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.958
Of course, you did.

05:19.041 --> 05:21.333
You made the same choice you always make.

05:21.416 --> 05:22.875
But you didn't stop with us.

05:22.958 --> 05:27.625
You carried death to the enclaves
like a plague with a will of its own.

05:27.708 --> 05:32.416
The elves, the Dark Moon Order.
How many lives needlessly lost?

05:32.916 --> 05:34.083
You enjoyed it.

05:34.833 --> 05:36.750
The smell of blood aroused you.

05:36.833 --> 05:38.083
I am, I'm a soldier.

05:38.875 --> 05:40.083
No.

05:40.166 --> 05:41.666
You are a scourge.

05:42.291 --> 05:44.208
You should have died in Coedwig.

05:44.291 --> 05:46.583
-You should have died by Fymryn's hand.

05:51.208 --> 05:52.208
Yes.

05:53.041 --> 05:54.458
Death isn't done with you.

06:06.375 --> 06:07.291
Kaden.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.541
You're here.

06:10.416 --> 06:11.333
You came back.

06:13.083 --> 06:16.500
They said there were no survivors.

06:17.500 --> 06:18.750
There weren't.

06:20.458 --> 06:23.125
Come. There's someone you have to meet.

06:29.083 --> 06:30.125
Our son.

06:30.750 --> 06:34.250
I… You never told me. I didn't know.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.750
You never returned from Leathsham.

06:36.833 --> 06:39.666
But you're home now, my love.

06:40.458 --> 06:41.666
Stay with us.

06:42.291 --> 06:43.541
A son.

06:47.625 --> 06:50.375
Blessed be
the path of Selemene.

06:50.458 --> 06:55.708
May her light be a beacon in darkness
and cleanse the world of evil.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.416
By moon's holy light, we pray.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.000
My temple has been defiled.

07:01.083 --> 07:05.666
My lotuses' stolen.
A thief from the outer lands.

07:05.750 --> 07:09.500
A heretic allowed to enter,
allowed to leave.

07:09.583 --> 07:10.791
I allowed her to escape.

07:10.875 --> 07:12.416
I failed you, goddess.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.458
I caused all of this.

07:14.541 --> 07:16.708
You disappoint me, child.

07:16.791 --> 07:18.916
You disappoint everyone.

07:19.916 --> 07:23.416
Sooner or later, you fail us all.

07:30.416 --> 07:32.041
Your allies are lost.

07:32.625 --> 07:35.708
Trapped in hells of their own making.

07:35.791 --> 07:37.208
You miscalculated.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.416
Now, give me what you owe.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.833
The five remaining dragon souls.

07:45.500 --> 07:48.458
That's not how this story ends.

07:50.333 --> 07:53.291
This is how every story ends.

07:53.375 --> 07:56.125
In death. In regret.

08:03.416 --> 08:06.208
-You cannot maintain this.

08:06.291 --> 08:09.291
Your life force is finite.

08:09.791 --> 08:11.541
You will wither and die.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.666
You are also in a hell of your own.

08:14.750 --> 08:17.708
It just happens to be the world
in which you already live.

08:20.083 --> 08:23.041
So much potential wasted.

08:23.125 --> 08:27.625
You fly from shelter to shelter,
hoping for someone to save you.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.541
Terrified of your own weakness.

08:29.625 --> 08:33.375
Now, you call yourself a goddess.

08:34.041 --> 08:36.333
Goddess of nothing.

08:38.125 --> 08:43.166
The great tragedy of a star
is to know all things emerge from her,

08:43.250 --> 08:46.708
and then, over countless eons,

08:46.791 --> 08:50.500
watch them die until only she remains.

08:51.208 --> 08:54.041
Burnt out, a forgotten cinder,

08:54.125 --> 08:57.958
floating alone in the void
with no one for company but me.

08:58.666 --> 09:00.791
I will never cast you out.

09:00.875 --> 09:04.875
I will merely wait for you to extinguish.

09:08.583 --> 09:10.166
I know what I left behind.

09:10.958 --> 09:13.250
-This is where I belong.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.875
Don't… Don't leave us again.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.500
I said I'll stay.

09:23.541 --> 09:24.958
-My boy.
-Kaden, no.

09:26.791 --> 09:29.208
Kaden, I need you. We need you.

09:29.291 --> 09:31.791
I'm here. I want to change my fate.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.916
Don't go. We can be a family.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.208
No.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.666
My love.

09:48.916 --> 09:50.750
Papa! Wait, Papa!

09:50.833 --> 09:52.375
Go home. Run!

09:52.458 --> 09:53.833
Papa, look out!

09:57.833 --> 09:58.833
No.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.708
A sacrifice made in vain.

10:02.791 --> 10:04.541
Their lives for yours.

10:04.625 --> 10:07.750
The unworthy. The monster.

10:22.708 --> 10:23.708
Mama.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.166
What?

10:38.625 --> 10:41.125
When you're old enough,
when you're ready,

10:41.208 --> 10:42.750
take this to Dragon Hold.

10:43.708 --> 10:45.375
They'll know what to do.

11:01.041 --> 11:05.083
Beg me to take
the dragon souls.

11:05.166 --> 11:07.333
To Mene's moon, we pray.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.541
Crescent light upon us all.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.666
Prayer to a dead goddess
cannot save you.

11:14.750 --> 11:18.041
Now, for all your power,

11:18.125 --> 11:20.875
for the thousand years you've squandered,

11:20.958 --> 11:24.458
after all that pain and struggle,

11:24.541 --> 11:27.416
we come to the end of your story.

11:28.041 --> 11:31.291
But only the beginning of mine.

11:32.708 --> 11:35.750
It wasn't a prayer.

11:37.375 --> 11:39.500
It was an invocation.

11:42.625 --> 11:43.625
Demon!

11:48.791 --> 11:50.041
I let myself in.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.875
I'll be letting them out.

11:59.375 --> 12:00.750
Selemene is dead.

12:01.458 --> 12:02.708
I am alone.

12:03.916 --> 12:06.625
-I am nothing.
-You are not alone.

12:06.708 --> 12:08.666
And you are far more than nothing.

12:14.958 --> 12:17.375
-You?
-They call you the Scourge.

12:18.625 --> 12:21.083
It only matters
if that is what you want to be,

12:21.833 --> 12:23.333
what you choose to be.

12:24.375 --> 12:26.041
This is Foulfell.

12:26.625 --> 12:29.416
I'm… I'm in Foulfell.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.708
And we need you.

12:36.791 --> 12:38.708
Enough blood for the dead.

12:38.791 --> 12:40.083
The elf girl.

12:40.166 --> 12:41.958
It's time to fight for the living.

12:49.541 --> 12:53.541
-A sacrifice out of love is not in vain.
-Fymryn?

12:53.625 --> 12:56.708
Gods, Fymryn. How did you get here?

12:56.791 --> 13:00.458
-Where have you been?
-My shadow is everywhere. As am I.

13:00.541 --> 13:01.583
Even here.

13:03.541 --> 13:04.541
Terrorblade.

13:14.375 --> 13:19.250
Child of Mene.
First, a thief. Now, a murderer.

13:19.333 --> 13:22.125
I've come to kill you, demon.
Let's get on with it.

13:25.166 --> 13:27.500
Fymryn can't do this alone.
How do we help her?

13:27.583 --> 13:31.333
-How do we kill him?
-Let the thunder speak.

13:48.583 --> 13:50.916
Dreamer of a godling.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.333
Your stories never end
the way you hope.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.291
Your lies have no power over me.

14:03.375 --> 14:07.083
But it's the truth
that hurts the most, isn't it?

14:07.166 --> 14:11.291
-It cuts the deepest. Burns the hottest.

14:12.333 --> 14:15.500
The truth? The truth is,
I have nothing but regrets.

14:15.583 --> 14:16.833
But I face them.

14:16.916 --> 14:20.041
I'm not afraid of you
because I'm not afraid of me.

14:21.750 --> 14:23.250
Then die unafraid.

14:33.083 --> 14:35.166
You want the dragon souls?

14:35.250 --> 14:36.375
Take them.

15:17.083 --> 15:21.458
The primal forces
of nature are not your playthings, demon.

15:24.625 --> 15:27.333
I will bend them to my will.

15:29.208 --> 15:33.500
It is inevitable. It is already written.

15:48.083 --> 15:50.958
-Keep them away from Davion.
-They won't touch him.

15:51.041 --> 15:54.000
Leave the fucking dragons to me.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.500
Scourge!

17:33.583 --> 17:35.375
Aah!

17:37.750 --> 17:40.291
Are you prepared
for the endless death you deserve?

18:05.125 --> 18:06.708
-Kaden.

18:53.083 --> 18:56.666
You wasted your life
on senseless slaughter.

18:57.541 --> 19:01.333
The blood of a thousand dragons
can't wash away your shame

19:01.916 --> 19:04.708
or bring back your brothers.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.541
I don't fight for the dead.

19:10.208 --> 19:12.791
I fight for the living!

19:29.791 --> 19:31.291
No more regrets.

19:32.291 --> 19:33.708
No more scourge.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.541
-Sagan, <i>takka</i>!

19:55.416 --> 19:59.625
You've chosen to die here.
Pointlessly.

20:21.291 --> 20:24.750
The dragon souls burn within you.

20:24.833 --> 20:25.916
Killing you.

20:26.666 --> 20:28.833
You can't fight forever.

20:30.625 --> 20:33.125
It doesn't
have to be forever.

20:33.750 --> 20:35.916
Just long enough.

20:46.750 --> 20:51.833
You fought well,
but there was never a hope for you.

20:51.916 --> 20:53.500
Any of you.

20:53.583 --> 20:55.666
You played at being gods.

20:55.750 --> 20:59.666
You played at redemption.
You pretended to matter.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.791
But it was only a play.

21:01.875 --> 21:04.708
A dance in shadow.

21:07.583 --> 21:13.416
Now you're on your knees,
having accomplished what?

21:14.833 --> 21:20.666
Poor Davion,
another sacrifice made in vain.

21:23.375 --> 21:27.958
Still just a boy
unworthy of his father's blood,

21:28.041 --> 21:30.250
his mother's ashes.

21:30.333 --> 21:32.458
All too human.

21:43.916 --> 21:47.291
Brave, indomitable.

21:47.375 --> 21:50.458
I understand why Slyrak chose you.

21:50.541 --> 21:53.875
I want… I want to make a deal.

21:53.958 --> 21:56.708
You have nothing left to offer me.

21:57.458 --> 21:59.041
Hear me out, okay?

21:59.875 --> 22:03.333
All you have to do is stand here.

22:04.250 --> 22:06.375
Stand here and gloat…

22:07.208 --> 22:09.083
and I'll just fucking kill you.

22:53.708 --> 22:54.708
Davion.

22:56.708 --> 22:57.708
Davion.

22:58.375 --> 23:01.625
You look terrible. Were you in a fight?

23:01.708 --> 23:02.791
Yes.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
We won. And no thanks to you.

23:07.916 --> 23:09.208
Mirana.

23:10.958 --> 23:12.125
Don't say it.

23:13.166 --> 23:14.333
Not a word.

23:28.375 --> 23:30.333
Oh!

23:37.333 --> 23:38.875
You have to let him go.

23:43.041 --> 23:45.375
This isn't done.

23:46.083 --> 23:49.750
Do not mourn
the passing of the old world.

23:49.833 --> 23:53.375
Embrace, instead, the coming of the new.

23:53.458 --> 23:55.875
Filomena would not want this.

23:55.958 --> 23:59.125
She will awaken to a better world.

24:00.916 --> 24:04.541
You will all awaken to a better world.

24:13.250 --> 24:15.833
What have you done? Why?

24:15.916 --> 24:20.083
I think you of all people
would understand, Your Majesty,

24:20.166 --> 24:22.583
what we owe those we love…

24:23.375 --> 24:25.250
and those we've lost.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.166
Remember.

24:58.791 --> 25:02.333
We must be very quiet,
or we'll scare it away.

25:03.083 --> 25:06.041
Watch carefully. The moth spins the silk.

25:06.125 --> 25:09.000
See? Isn't it wonderful?

25:09.083 --> 25:10.750
It is wonderful, my love.

25:10.833 --> 25:12.666
Beyond words.

25:15.166 --> 25:18.625
And you, Papa, did you know it?

25:18.708 --> 25:20.500
Did I discover it?

25:21.291 --> 25:24.583
Yes, Filomena, I believe you did.
