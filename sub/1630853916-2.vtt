01:01.500 --> 01:02.541
This?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.125
It's new.

01:06.375 --> 01:07.208
It'll fade soon.

01:14.416 --> 01:15.875
Happy birthday, Leni.

01:16.458 --> 01:17.875
Happy birthday, Gina.

01:21.083 --> 01:22.958
There's something you're not telling me.

01:24.875 --> 01:25.708
There's nothing.

01:27.333 --> 01:28.166
Another year.

01:29.625 --> 01:30.875
Another year.

01:32.875 --> 01:36.500
<i>I knew something was wrong,</i>
<i>in Paris, the night we did the switch.</i>

01:45.333 --> 01:48.416
<i>What is it, Gina? What have you done?</i>

01:49.291 --> 01:50.583
So good to see y'all.

01:52.458 --> 01:54.083
So good to see y'all.

01:56.083 --> 01:56.916
Y'all.

01:57.666 --> 01:58.500
Y'all.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Y'all.

02:02.125 --> 02:03.583
So good to see y'all.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.083
So good to see y'all.

02:14.958 --> 02:17.666
<i>I get it, Gina. You're not lost.</i>

02:18.541 --> 02:20.166
<i>You just don't want to be found.</i>

02:20.708 --> 02:24.500
<i>And until I find you,</i>
<i>I have to play both parts.</i>

02:27.500 --> 02:30.125
Sis, truly, you need your rest as well.

02:30.791 --> 02:31.833
Mommy!

02:31.916 --> 02:33.125
Hey, bug.

02:33.208 --> 02:35.625
Gina, you stay at the Riverside
and catch up on sleep.

02:35.708 --> 02:38.208
I'll come fetch you
as soon as I drop Mattie at school.

02:38.291 --> 02:39.458
All right. Ciao, ciao.

02:40.250 --> 02:42.875
You don't say "Ciao, ciao."
Auntie Gina says that.

02:42.958 --> 02:45.250
Well, talking with your Auntie Gina,

02:45.333 --> 02:47.541
she's so Hollywood, it rubs off.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.750
But she's staying away?
'Cause she's the one who needs rest?

02:50.833 --> 02:54.791
The emotion of it all. Wore her out.
She may head home soon.

02:55.791 --> 02:57.708
Here. Sit here.

02:57.791 --> 03:00.458
Just a few more questions,
we'll be out of your hair.

03:00.541 --> 03:03.166
-You've asked so many already.
-It's okay.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.333
It looks funny.

03:06.291 --> 03:08.541
Oh. It's still wet from the shower, honey.

03:08.625 --> 03:11.500
-All right, you get ready for school.
-Come here, Mattie.

03:11.583 --> 03:14.041
If I can make out
my chicken scratch,

03:14.125 --> 03:17.416
you mentioned before
that there were three, maybe four thieves?

03:17.500 --> 03:18.333
Yes.

03:19.041 --> 03:22.333
That's right. All in… ski masks.

03:22.416 --> 03:24.416
And in summer. Huh.

03:25.166 --> 03:27.458
But you don't remember exactly how many?

03:28.125 --> 03:31.791
And you didn't actually see them
break the lock and release the horses?

03:31.875 --> 03:35.625
No. Uh, I heard a noise
and when I went to see what was going on,

03:35.708 --> 03:37.458
the horses were already loose.

03:37.541 --> 03:38.541
Dear me.

03:39.333 --> 03:41.958
Now, did it strike you as at all odd,

03:42.041 --> 03:44.791
and I'm just thinking this through,

03:44.875 --> 03:46.833
that if they were here to steal horses,

03:46.916 --> 03:49.458
then why did they release
so many into the wild?

03:49.541 --> 03:52.458
Who cares what they were thinking?
She did what any of us would.

03:52.541 --> 03:55.208
-She tried to stop them.
-Did you try to stop them?

03:55.291 --> 03:58.541
Or did you just give chase
after they were gone?

03:58.625 --> 04:00.041
The horses were running wild

04:00.125 --> 04:03.833
and one of them already
had the foal riding away fast.

04:03.916 --> 04:06.458
I guess I just acted on impulse.

04:06.541 --> 04:08.666
Pursuing criminals
into the deep woods

04:08.750 --> 04:12.541
strikes me as… an unusual impulse.

04:12.625 --> 04:15.166
Most people just hide, call the police.

04:15.250 --> 04:19.166
Oh, well, maybe it was
the way I was raised.

04:19.250 --> 04:22.250
We work hard for what we have.
We don't like when people take it.

04:22.333 --> 04:27.250
Oh, yes. Yes.
So you were well into the woods?

04:27.333 --> 04:30.333
Yes. And, uh, Prince got spooked.

04:30.416 --> 04:31.458
Spooked on what?

04:31.541 --> 04:32.750
Oh.

04:32.833 --> 04:33.916
Be specific, hon.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.416
Well, I didn't see.

04:36.666 --> 04:41.291
Uh… Probably a cottonmouth or a possum.
It happened so fast.

04:41.375 --> 04:43.291
I came off, hit my head, passed out.

04:43.375 --> 04:46.166
And when I woke up,
Prince was gone and I was lost.

04:47.291 --> 04:48.916
You didn't hear the search party?

04:49.875 --> 04:51.666
I heard a helicopter

04:51.750 --> 04:55.500
and I tried to find a clearing
so I could signal to it,

04:55.583 --> 04:58.833
but, you know… Hit my head
and I was dizzy.

04:58.916 --> 05:03.666
We need some family time now, all right?
We… we need to get Mathilda to school…

05:03.750 --> 05:07.458
Certainly. Paula and I will set about
hunting your masked bandits.

05:07.541 --> 05:11.916
Shouldn't be too hard.
They do sound a bit… haphazard.

05:12.791 --> 05:15.291
-Thank you for everything.
-Of course, Victor.

05:15.375 --> 05:17.583
Happy to be of service. Always. Always.

05:17.666 --> 05:20.750
Oh! Leni, I'm… I'm so sorry.

05:20.833 --> 05:22.500
Just one more thing.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.250
You said that your horse, Prince,

05:24.333 --> 05:28.458
startled and you fell
and you were knocked unconscious.

05:29.083 --> 05:30.208
Fell on which side now?

05:30.291 --> 05:33.458
Well, on the… On the right.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.833
That's… You know…
Had the cut on my head.

05:36.916 --> 05:38.083
Sure, that makes sense.

05:38.166 --> 05:43.541
Oh, except… Look, my spatial relations,
they are terrible,

05:43.625 --> 05:46.708
but, um, when Prince reached us,

05:47.500 --> 05:51.041
the blood was on his left shoulder.

05:51.125 --> 05:52.916
Your right side, his left…

05:54.041 --> 05:55.916
Now I'm not sure how that works.

05:56.000 --> 05:56.958
Huh.

05:57.041 --> 06:00.083
But, um… You know what?
I'll keep thinking on it.

06:00.166 --> 06:03.833
You… You take good care of yourself.
Now, you heal that head, you hear?

06:05.000 --> 06:08.625
Okay. All right. Victor. Claudia.

06:09.666 --> 06:11.541
<i>Gina, what the fuck is going on?</i>

06:12.166 --> 06:14.458
<i>The police know something.</i>
<i>Are you in trouble?</i>

06:15.708 --> 06:18.250
<i>Why wouldn't you tell me?</i>
<i>I know I can help.</i>

06:19.000 --> 06:22.666
<i>I'll always help.</i>
<i>It's always been us, Gina.</i>

06:23.500 --> 06:26.833
<i>No one comes between. Not even Jack.</i>

06:30.666 --> 06:33.583
Yeah, all right.
I'm treating you so much better, boy.

06:36.250 --> 06:37.416
You've been gone all summer.

06:39.375 --> 06:41.458
-Yeah, we delivered some horses.
-Mmm-hmm.

06:41.541 --> 06:42.708
I did a few junior rodeos.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.625
You win anything?

06:45.250 --> 06:48.541
Yeah, first in roping. In Denver.

06:49.125 --> 06:50.250
Nice.

06:52.375 --> 06:55.000
-You guys have changed.
-No, we haven't.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.458
You totally have.

06:59.541 --> 07:01.416
You start high school next week, yeah?

07:01.500 --> 07:02.583
Yeah.

07:03.083 --> 07:05.083
I'll drive you.
Show you around. If you want.

07:06.833 --> 07:08.291
Yeah, that'd be cool.

07:11.583 --> 07:15.166
Get in there, Brett. Come on. Excuse me.

07:17.541 --> 07:19.041
You can talk to him, you know?

07:19.541 --> 07:21.500
He likes you, Leni. Not me.

07:22.041 --> 07:24.583
As if. Can't tell the difference.

07:28.625 --> 07:31.125
Leni? You all right?

07:33.250 --> 07:34.083
Yes.

07:36.208 --> 07:37.750
I just need to rest for a minute.

07:46.375 --> 07:47.625
You sure you're all right?

07:48.250 --> 07:49.083
No.

07:50.583 --> 07:51.458
Of course not.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
But I will be. I just, um…

07:58.791 --> 07:59.833
I need some rest.

07:59.916 --> 08:02.750
-Yeah.
-There's nothing else you want to tell me?

08:04.625 --> 08:05.458
No.

08:07.916 --> 08:08.750
No. Why?

08:11.083 --> 08:14.750
When we were up on the trail searching
for you, I saw the hoof prints.

08:15.833 --> 08:18.750
It was Prince leading the foal,
not some horse thieves.

08:19.708 --> 08:22.125
And it wasn't a chase, they were walking.

08:24.458 --> 08:25.291
Look at me.

08:25.833 --> 08:29.458
And if I saw that, then Floss saw it too.

08:29.541 --> 08:32.041
No. It must have been
their horse leading the foal.

08:32.125 --> 08:35.125
Only if it favors the right front foot.
Exactly like Prince.

08:35.208 --> 08:38.291
-I need you to tell me the truth.
-I am telling the truth.

08:38.375 --> 08:42.000
-Floss knows something. Listen to me!
-There's nothing for Floss to know!

08:43.583 --> 08:46.041
This won't just go away.
They'll come looking for it.

08:46.125 --> 08:49.250
What, do you think
I was trying to steal her?

08:49.333 --> 08:51.208
Do you think I'm capable of that?

08:51.291 --> 08:52.916
I don't know anymore.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.250
Right now, I'm just trying
to figure this out

08:55.333 --> 08:57.375
because none of it makes sense.

08:57.458 --> 09:01.250
I'm not the kind of person
who steals a horse from their husband.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.416
Now what do you think I was trying to do?

09:03.500 --> 09:04.708
Run away.

09:07.625 --> 09:09.125
-Run away?
-Yeah.

09:09.625 --> 09:12.291
Jack, what would make you think
that I would run away?

09:12.375 --> 09:15.583
You haven't been around.
I don't know where you go half the time.

09:16.833 --> 09:19.875
You won't answer any of my questions
and then this happens?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.458
-Is there somebody else?
-No.

09:23.541 --> 09:25.958
-Did they put you up to this?
-No, of course not.

09:28.166 --> 09:29.458
Why do I think you're lying?

09:31.416 --> 09:33.583
I'm not. Look at me.

09:34.166 --> 09:37.375
Jack, I swear to you.
I'm telling the truth.

09:38.208 --> 09:40.208
There's something you're not telling me.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.375
Is there something you're not telling me?

09:44.208 --> 09:46.541
-No.
-'Cause I just got off the phone with Gina

09:46.625 --> 09:48.500
and she's at the Riverside

09:48.583 --> 09:52.458
and she's not comfortable in this house
any more because of you.

09:55.625 --> 09:58.250
You want to tell me what happened
while I was gone?

09:59.833 --> 10:02.041
Gina always brings drama. You know that.

10:07.625 --> 10:08.541
Jack.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.666
Whatever we find out,
we have to stick together.

10:17.708 --> 10:18.541
Jack.

10:19.833 --> 10:21.833
All right? It's just you and me.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.583
<i>Gina,</i>
<i>what's happening in my house?</i>

10:26.583 --> 10:27.708
<i>You stole from Jack?</i>

10:29.083 --> 10:30.166
<i>You ran away.</i>

10:30.250 --> 10:33.833
<i>You left me accused of a crime I didn't do</i>
<i>and don't even understand.</i>

10:35.583 --> 10:36.583
<i>And for what?</i>

10:37.750 --> 10:38.625
<i>Or who?</i>

10:41.000 --> 10:42.125
Okay.

10:44.750 --> 10:46.333
Can I call you if I get scared?

10:47.625 --> 10:51.541
Of course. Just ask Ms. Jellika
in the front office, okay?

10:51.625 --> 10:53.041
Can I use the flipper phone?

10:54.375 --> 10:55.208
The what?

10:55.833 --> 11:01.500
The phone that opens and closes like this.
It's in the glove box.

11:04.625 --> 11:06.166
Let's just see about that.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.125
Huh.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
You know, I must have left that at home.

11:24.166 --> 11:26.000
But you always have it in there.

11:27.125 --> 11:28.250
I'm sorry, love.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.791
Let's just get you inside, huh?

11:35.500 --> 11:39.125
One, two, three.

11:44.541 --> 11:45.583
Meg.

11:46.833 --> 11:49.416
Meggie. Hey, stop. Hey.

11:51.375 --> 11:54.000
-Hey, can we talk?
-There's nothing to talk about.

11:54.833 --> 11:58.083
-I'm glad you're safe. Now, I have to go.
-Look… Hey, uh…

12:00.541 --> 12:01.875
After what happened to me,

12:01.958 --> 12:04.500
I'm… I'm, you know,
getting a second chance

12:04.583 --> 12:09.625
to reset and undo all the bad things
that happened this past year.

12:10.416 --> 12:14.125
You've ruined his life for a second time

12:14.208 --> 12:15.833
and now you want to make things right?

12:17.625 --> 12:18.541
I'll fix this.

12:19.916 --> 12:20.750
I swear.

12:21.416 --> 12:23.166
I'll believe that when I see it.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.083
See you later, Leni.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.125
<i>Why is Meg so angry?</i>

12:28.208 --> 12:31.375
Huh? Whose life did I ruin?
What the fuck, G?

12:31.458 --> 12:33.958
Please, Gina. Call me. Okay?

12:35.833 --> 12:38.458
And what's this flip phone
Mattie was talking about?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.791
If I could keep the same number,
that would be great.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.250
Of course.

12:44.791 --> 12:47.250
-I… I saw y'all on TV.
-You did?

12:47.333 --> 12:48.208
-Mmm-hmm.
-Well…

12:49.625 --> 12:51.750
I hope I don't disappoint in person.

12:51.833 --> 12:56.833
Oh, no. Uh… No. No, I remembered
selling you the phone.

12:56.916 --> 13:01.375
I said to my mama, "This missing lady.
I sold her a phone."

13:01.458 --> 13:02.333
-Huh!
-Uh-huh.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.041
"And she must be out of range
because it's an excellent phone."

13:06.125 --> 13:08.333
-Right.
-I remember what you said to me that day.

13:08.416 --> 13:09.666
Well, I hope it was meaningful.

13:09.750 --> 13:13.250
-Oh, it was pretty goddamn inspiring.
-Hmm.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.416
You said, "Cal, don't wait."

13:16.375 --> 13:18.041
"Live the life you want."

13:18.833 --> 13:21.750
-Huh.
-A week later, I got a promotion. Uh-huh.

13:21.833 --> 13:23.791
-Shift manager.
-Shift manager!

13:23.875 --> 13:25.208
-Wow!
-Yeah. Thanks.

13:25.791 --> 13:28.416
Hey, do you think
you'd be able to transfer the data?

13:28.500 --> 13:30.916
Oh, of course.
I can move the contacts and stuff,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.708
but not the messages
or anything like that you might've saved.

13:33.791 --> 13:35.291
Shoot, um…

13:36.291 --> 13:38.166
So, like, the incoming and outgoing calls…

13:38.250 --> 13:42.125
'Cause there's phone numbers in there
I don't have saved to my address book. So…

13:42.958 --> 13:47.291
Well, I can go into billing and print out
a hard copy of this month's.

13:47.375 --> 13:49.791
Great. You are a lifesaver.

13:50.833 --> 13:56.375
Um, just out of curiosity,
has anyone been using the phone?

13:57.208 --> 13:58.666
You know, let's check.

14:03.916 --> 14:06.583
No. No calls for three days.

14:16.375 --> 14:17.458
Len.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.416
-Deputy.
-Oh, funny.

14:22.041 --> 14:25.708
Yeah, you know it's Paula to you, Len.
I missed you.

14:25.791 --> 14:26.708
I missed you, too.

14:28.125 --> 14:31.208
Yeah, we should, uh, talk later.

14:31.291 --> 14:33.750
Yeah, we need to talk about Floss.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.750
She's been down in cold cases.

14:37.541 --> 14:39.916
Yeah. The same boxes
I showed you a ways back.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
That, uh… That church fire.

14:43.833 --> 14:46.208
Church fire? From years ago?

14:46.291 --> 14:48.333
Yeah, that one you were looking at.

14:50.458 --> 14:51.666
I just…

14:51.750 --> 14:54.916
I don't know. I guess she thinks
that they're connected somehow,

14:55.000 --> 14:56.750
but I don't… I don't get it. I…

14:58.625 --> 14:59.458
Um…

15:00.083 --> 15:02.958
Anyway, it really is good to see you well.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.541
<i>I talked with Paula, Gina.</i>

15:24.291 --> 15:25.750
<i>She seems very fond of you.</i>

15:30.291 --> 15:33.291
<i>And she brought up the fire. The church.</i>

15:34.083 --> 15:35.625
<i>That you were looking into it.</i>

15:37.208 --> 15:38.500
<i>What are you doing, Gina?</i>

15:48.958 --> 15:50.666
<i>Yo, so can you do, like, 30?</i>

15:53.625 --> 15:54.541
Who is this?

15:56.166 --> 16:00.208
<i>You want to trade names now?</i>
<i>Do you want to do business or be friends?</i>

16:00.291 --> 16:02.250
-Business.
-<i>So can you do 30?</i>

16:02.916 --> 16:04.875
Thirty? Uh, 30 what?

16:04.958 --> 16:08.000
<i>Ket! Obviously. You…</i>
<i>You running some other shit now?</i>

16:10.583 --> 16:11.791
Maybe I am.

16:11.875 --> 16:14.333
<i>Well, I ain't some smackhead,</i>
<i>so ket's just fine.</i>

16:14.416 --> 16:16.041
<i>Meet me at the usual place.</i>

16:16.125 --> 16:19.833
No, I need you to meet me
at Wachtell Park. In an hour.

16:19.916 --> 16:21.750
<i>Wachtell Park?</i>
<i>Like, in Mount Echo?</i>

16:21.833 --> 16:24.291
<i>Why the fuck would you want us</i>
<i>to come over there?</i>

16:26.000 --> 16:29.750
You tell me. Somewhere new.
We can't get lazy.

16:29.833 --> 16:33.458
<i>Okay. Spy game.</i>
<i>Bayner Park. Men's bathroom.</i>

16:34.125 --> 16:36.083
Bayner Park in Plattsville.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.000
<i>Duh. The fuck is up with you?</i>

16:38.083 --> 16:39.916
Bring cash. Don't be late. One hour.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.375
Leni.

17:03.333 --> 17:04.250
Dad.

17:04.333 --> 17:05.708
What are you doing in here?

17:05.791 --> 17:09.916
Oh, Daphne Villers,
the, uh, vet over in Riverton…

17:10.708 --> 17:13.208
Yeah, she needs me
to take some, uh, ketamine to her.

17:13.291 --> 17:15.625
Something went wrong with a delivery

17:15.708 --> 17:18.208
and she needs to perform
an emergency arthroscopic.

17:21.750 --> 17:22.583
Leni.

17:25.041 --> 17:26.208
Is everything okay?

17:26.291 --> 17:28.541
Yeah, feeling much better, thank you.

17:29.625 --> 17:32.166
Are you unhappy with us? With life here?

17:32.250 --> 17:33.833
Dad, I don't know why you'd…

17:35.125 --> 17:35.958
Uh…

17:37.125 --> 17:40.250
Jack and I, yeah,
we're having some money issues,

17:40.333 --> 17:42.083
but nothing we can't sort out.

17:42.166 --> 17:45.000
I know you've been trying.
This is a difficult time.

17:45.083 --> 17:46.833
Yeah, thanks, Dad.

17:48.125 --> 17:51.125
I'm going to take off.
'Cause Daphne said it's urgent, so--

17:51.208 --> 17:54.250
Leni, Daphne Villers
closed her vet practice six months ago.

17:55.000 --> 17:55.833
Huh.

17:56.416 --> 17:58.000
I guess it's an emergency case.

18:00.333 --> 18:01.958
You're just like your mother.

18:02.041 --> 18:05.958
Strong, proud, private.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.166
But she was never dishonest.

18:11.541 --> 18:16.083
And it breaks my heart to see this.
Whatever… Whatever this is.

18:16.166 --> 18:18.708
Leni, you have to be
very careful right now.

18:18.791 --> 18:21.416
Your marriage, your family, Mattie…

18:22.041 --> 18:24.208
Those are the most precious things
you have.

18:24.291 --> 18:26.750
I know that.
That's why I'm doing what I'm doing.

18:27.250 --> 18:29.333
Is it? Or is it for him?

18:30.083 --> 18:32.375
Dad, I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:34.791 --> 18:38.833
-I don't know what you think you've seen.
-I know my own daughter's heart.

18:40.833 --> 18:43.458
I know you've been gone from us
long before you went missing.

18:43.541 --> 18:44.875
Okay, that's, um…

18:46.500 --> 18:49.208
It's over and I'm fixing it. Everything.

18:51.291 --> 18:53.125
Thank you for telling me the truth.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.208
We'll talk about this later.

19:01.583 --> 19:04.208
I want you and your sister
to come to dinner tonight.

19:05.291 --> 19:06.583
It's your birthday tomorrow.

19:07.291 --> 19:09.625
Normally, you two are off someplace…

19:10.125 --> 19:10.958
…glamorous.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.083
Paris or Fiji.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.791
I'm never a part of that.

19:19.166 --> 19:23.500
But this year
brought the two of you right here.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.958
-And I don't want to miss my chance.
-I'd be happy to.

19:29.041 --> 19:31.375
But Gina's a little complicated.

19:31.458 --> 19:34.000
If… If anyone can get her here, you can.

19:38.750 --> 19:39.791
I'll do my best.

19:41.000 --> 19:41.833
Please.

19:43.458 --> 19:44.583
It's important to me.

19:46.583 --> 19:47.583
Okay.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.458
<i>What are you getting me into now?</i>

20:02.541 --> 20:05.333
<i>I don't know how much longer</i>
<i>I can keep this act going.</i>

20:22.708 --> 20:24.416
Well, you got the shit or what?

20:25.625 --> 20:26.791
Yeah, I got it.

20:28.125 --> 20:29.333
All right.

20:30.750 --> 20:32.333
I need to ask you something.

20:32.416 --> 20:33.458
What?

20:39.708 --> 20:41.750
You remember who first hooked us up?

20:42.333 --> 20:43.750
I lost track of my contacts.

20:44.333 --> 20:45.625
Uh… I don't know.

20:46.708 --> 20:49.208
Really? You don't know?

20:50.458 --> 20:51.666
You don't remember?

20:52.250 --> 20:55.041
Does this ring a fucking bell? Huh?

20:59.458 --> 21:01.750
Like… My brother's girlfriend
knows that one guy.

21:02.833 --> 21:06.083
Why the fuck you asking so many questions
you should know the answer to?

21:07.166 --> 21:10.541
-The guy who usually comes with me?
-Yeah. The guy in the red truck.

21:11.500 --> 21:15.125
-Right.
-Are you gonna give us the K or what?

21:15.625 --> 21:18.458
Are you gonna give me the cash or what?

21:24.791 --> 21:26.916
-Get the fuck out of here.
-Let's go.

21:49.625 --> 21:52.125
<i>Fuck. Fuck, are you all right?</i>

21:52.208 --> 21:56.000
Yes. I'm sorry.
I called as soon as I could.

21:56.083 --> 21:57.541
<i>You went home.</i>

21:57.625 --> 22:00.291
I had to go home. I got hurt. I got lost.

22:00.791 --> 22:02.166
<i>You sound strange.</i>

22:03.833 --> 22:05.208
I have to be careful.

22:06.375 --> 22:07.291
Where, uh…

22:09.000 --> 22:10.083
Where should we meet?

22:10.166 --> 22:11.500
<i>Come to the cabin.</i>

22:12.958 --> 22:14.458
Can we meet up first? I…

22:15.333 --> 22:16.166
i, uh…

22:17.250 --> 22:19.166
I don't wanna drive too far.
I hit my head.

22:20.750 --> 22:22.208
<i>Where do you want to meet?</i>

22:25.125 --> 22:26.583
Behind the Echo Echo.

22:28.708 --> 22:29.833
In a half hour.

22:30.333 --> 22:32.208
<i>Okay, but…</i>

22:34.041 --> 22:37.041
<i>Okay, I'll see you there.</i>
<i>Back parking lot.</i>

23:07.833 --> 23:10.083
<i>So, it's Dylan James.</i>

23:10.666 --> 23:14.083
<i>You've let him into your life again</i>
<i>after all these years.</i>

23:15.000 --> 23:16.916
<i>You chose him.</i>

23:34.208 --> 23:36.041
I thought I'd hear from you sooner.

23:36.875 --> 23:37.875
Lost my phone.

23:38.541 --> 23:41.416
You know, no phone booths in the woods.

23:42.208 --> 23:43.833
Had to go home and, you know…

23:51.083 --> 23:52.875
I thought you changed your mind.

23:54.208 --> 23:55.333
About everything.

23:58.875 --> 23:59.708
No.

24:00.625 --> 24:01.458
Yeah.

24:02.875 --> 24:06.583
Our young customers, in Plattsville,
send their best wishes.

24:12.916 --> 24:13.750
No.

24:15.250 --> 24:16.291
Not here.

24:16.875 --> 24:19.125
-Still amateur.
-Come on.

24:23.708 --> 24:24.625
Yeah?

24:25.500 --> 24:26.708
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

24:44.041 --> 24:46.583
I found this shitty bar on, uh, Route 16.

24:46.666 --> 24:47.958
They'll serve you there.

24:48.958 --> 24:51.541
Uh, they haven't changed the jukebox
since 1958.

24:52.291 --> 24:53.958
-It's boss.
-Boss.

24:55.625 --> 24:57.750
Please, Gina, no one says "boss."

25:02.500 --> 25:03.625
I'm sorry.

25:04.208 --> 25:06.333
-For what?
-For being out of touch.

25:07.583 --> 25:10.291
-You couldn't help it.
-No, that's true.

25:10.375 --> 25:12.041
But we're okay now, right?

25:12.125 --> 25:13.125
Okay?

25:15.208 --> 25:16.458
No, we're not okay.

25:18.625 --> 25:22.000
-What the fuck happened? We had a plan.
-No, I know.

25:23.875 --> 25:27.916
Prince got away from me, you know.
And I hit my head.

25:28.000 --> 25:28.958
But you're all…

25:30.750 --> 25:32.000
You're all right?

25:32.916 --> 25:33.750
Yeah.

25:35.208 --> 25:36.583
Everything's fine?

25:36.666 --> 25:38.166
Yeah. Fine.

25:53.708 --> 25:55.041
You think they suspect?

25:56.250 --> 25:58.291
And what…
What does Jack think is happening?

25:58.375 --> 25:59.625
He's suspicious.

26:02.250 --> 26:03.458
Floss is too.

26:04.875 --> 26:06.708
And your sister's in town.

26:06.791 --> 26:08.958
She's fine. She doesn't know anything.

26:09.041 --> 26:11.000
She still pretending to be Gina?

26:16.875 --> 26:17.750
Yes.

26:20.041 --> 26:22.250
Leni doesn't know about us.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.291
-What a fucking mess.
-Yeah.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.958
We should just go. Now. Today.

27:08.708 --> 27:09.791
Now?

27:12.916 --> 27:14.125
Why not?

27:15.916 --> 27:19.208
-Just live off the money in my purse?
-I've lived off a lot less.

27:20.083 --> 27:22.166
I… I can't leave right now.

27:27.416 --> 27:28.375
Why not?

27:29.250 --> 27:30.125
Jack.

27:31.458 --> 27:33.791
-Floss, Mattie…
-You said you dealt with that.

27:33.875 --> 27:36.500
I did, but now everybody knows
about the foal.

27:37.041 --> 27:39.750
And Floss has her eye on me.
It's too dangerous.

27:39.833 --> 27:42.375
That's all the more reason to go now.

28:04.958 --> 28:06.541
Oh, Jesus.

28:10.458 --> 28:12.083
I missed you so much.

28:13.250 --> 28:14.541
I was so worried.

28:14.625 --> 28:17.708
I missed you, too. Yeah.

28:24.666 --> 28:27.583
I'll ask my grandmother.
She's gonna help us.

28:27.666 --> 28:29.750
Because she loves you like I love you.

28:31.625 --> 28:34.875
She loves you. Like I do.

28:52.458 --> 28:53.375
What the fuck?

28:54.500 --> 28:56.000
You thought I wouldn't know?

28:56.083 --> 28:59.083
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to find her.

28:59.958 --> 29:03.541
-She never came back.
<i>-Who</i> never came back?

29:03.625 --> 29:04.708
Gina.

29:06.416 --> 29:07.958
Gina never came back.

29:09.458 --> 29:10.416
All right.

29:13.541 --> 29:15.750
And you? Where have you been?

29:15.833 --> 29:18.500
I've been in Los Angeles.

29:18.583 --> 29:20.958
Living Gina's life.
But you know this, don't you?

29:21.041 --> 29:23.083
She told you everything. Didn't she?

29:23.166 --> 29:24.541
Yeah, she did.

29:24.625 --> 29:26.791
You think she's doing it for you?

29:27.500 --> 29:31.416
You can't find her either
and you're scared like me.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.375
You are desperate to find her.

29:35.791 --> 29:38.541
-I'm gonna find her.
-That's what I'm trying to do.

29:44.041 --> 29:47.500
It's what you're trying to do?
By fucking me up?

29:47.583 --> 29:49.791
How do I know you're not the one
who hurt her?

29:49.875 --> 29:50.875
No.

29:53.291 --> 29:57.541
I love her. I'd <i>never</i> hurt her.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.250
I know you think you do.

30:03.458 --> 30:04.708
She's not well, Dylan.

30:05.500 --> 30:07.000
She's been sick for some time.

30:07.083 --> 30:09.291
She says that you're the sick one.

30:10.125 --> 30:13.291
That you are the one
who's making her keep this whole thing up.

30:13.375 --> 30:14.458
I'm sure she does.

30:15.833 --> 30:19.916
Look, I know we've got a history,
you and me…

30:20.000 --> 30:22.500
-Oh, yeah, you bet.
-But you haven't been around.

30:23.791 --> 30:25.291
And you don't know.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.208
She tell you about her breakdown?

30:33.625 --> 30:37.416
-No.
-In college she had a psychotic break.

30:41.458 --> 30:43.166
She tell you about the miscarriage?

30:45.666 --> 30:46.541
No.

30:48.125 --> 30:53.125
Everything I've…
I've done, trading lives, it is for her.

30:53.208 --> 30:55.333
Dylan, you gotta believe it. I love her.

30:55.416 --> 30:57.708
I'm trying to find her
because she might be hurt.

30:58.791 --> 31:01.208
She may be running away from both of us.

31:01.291 --> 31:03.541
Oh, she ain't running away from me.

31:05.583 --> 31:07.416
Are you so sure?

31:07.500 --> 31:08.750
I'm damn sure.

31:10.625 --> 31:11.958
We had a plan.

31:13.541 --> 31:16.666
We <i>have </i>a plan.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.708
What if she changed the plan?

31:27.791 --> 31:29.708
Get up. I'm gonna bring you back.

31:32.333 --> 31:33.416
Come on.

31:37.041 --> 31:38.166
-Yeah.

31:38.250 --> 31:40.708
-Fuck, forgot my purse.

32:06.083 --> 32:07.416
-Come on!
-Coming!

32:11.041 --> 32:13.583
<i>Do you not remember</i>
<i>what he did to us?</i>

32:13.666 --> 32:17.416
<i>He almost ruined our lives, Gina,</i>
<i>and he would have if I hadn't stopped him.</i>

32:18.458 --> 32:20.958
And what? Now, he's back
to finish what he started?

32:21.041 --> 32:22.333
I won't let him.

32:23.916 --> 32:25.875
I won't let him ruin you… Us.

32:25.958 --> 32:28.125
It's not happening again.

32:29.333 --> 32:32.666
I'm going to find you, Gina,
and I'm gonna fucking fix this.

32:34.541 --> 32:35.708
I will find you.

32:37.458 --> 32:38.708
Hello there!

32:39.958 --> 32:41.791
I got the coffee you ordered.

32:44.541 --> 32:48.083
Now I know
you're in there. I heard you talking.

32:57.125 --> 33:00.416
Leni, I didn't expect to see you here.

33:01.291 --> 33:03.000
Wait, it is Leni, isn't it?

33:04.250 --> 33:08.041
Are you allowed to do that?
Impersonate room service?

33:08.125 --> 33:10.541
Come on now,
I didn't say I was room service.

33:10.625 --> 33:13.625
I said I had the coffee you ordered.

33:13.708 --> 33:17.625
Bert's super busy
with that quilters convention,

33:18.875 --> 33:21.875
so I offered to bring it up. Gina here?

33:22.916 --> 33:25.833
Uh, she is about to hop in the shower.

33:25.916 --> 33:28.666
-Hmm.
-I'll tell her that you dropped by.

33:30.250 --> 33:33.083
Perhaps you could tell her,
now that I'm here.

33:34.250 --> 33:37.250
And I'll wait. I… I've been trying
to call her all morning.

33:41.083 --> 33:42.833
-Gina?

33:44.083 --> 33:46.041
Hey. Sorry to interrupt…

33:46.625 --> 33:47.583
Uh…

33:57.375 --> 33:58.333
Yeah, so…

34:00.416 --> 34:03.000
Turns out that she put on
one of those seaweed wraps.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.583
-She's so La-La Land.
-Oh.

34:04.666 --> 34:06.708
But I will tell her to, uh,
call you later.

34:06.791 --> 34:11.291
Hmm, I'd really love to see her
face-to-face.

34:11.375 --> 34:14.791
If I could. The human process
of it all, you know.

34:14.875 --> 34:17.041
Yeah, she's on the plane home tonight--

34:17.125 --> 34:19.833
Perfect. She can stop by the station
on the way.

34:25.750 --> 34:29.458
Or I could just wait now.

34:30.250 --> 34:33.500
-Do you need to get that?
-No. I am all good.

34:34.791 --> 34:37.458
Here… No. I'm gonna help her
with that seaweed wrap.

34:37.541 --> 34:42.458
Okay, you tell Gina
that I look forward to seeing her.

34:42.541 --> 34:45.833
-Great.
-Once she's all dressed and all.

34:47.500 --> 34:49.291
-Thanks for that coffee.
-Mmm-hmm.

35:21.375 --> 35:22.916
Hey, sweetheart, um…

35:24.125 --> 35:26.125
So sorry, I just got back
from meeting Leni.

35:26.208 --> 35:27.458
How is she?

35:27.541 --> 35:29.125
<i>She doesn't seem to be so good.</i>

35:29.208 --> 35:31.750
<i>Actually, something feels weird.</i>

35:31.833 --> 35:33.916
<i>I think maybe she and Jack</i>
<i>are having problems.</i>

35:34.000 --> 35:36.500
-What kind of problems?
-I don't know.

35:37.583 --> 35:40.791
I think, uh, maybe she might need me
to stay here a little longer

35:40.875 --> 35:41.833
to support her.

35:41.916 --> 35:43.208
Are those new earrings?

35:44.166 --> 35:45.000
Uh…

35:46.375 --> 35:49.166
Yeah. Yeah, I borrowed them from Leni.

35:49.250 --> 35:51.208
<i>Oh, hmm. Not really your style.</i>

35:51.291 --> 35:53.500
Jesus, are we talking about earrings here?

35:53.583 --> 35:56.208
No. No, not at all. I… I just--

35:56.291 --> 35:58.458
No, it's all right. I'm… I'm sorry.

35:58.541 --> 36:02.500
-I'm just, um, feeling a little--
-<i>Of course you are.</i>

36:02.583 --> 36:05.625
And the birthday trip to Tahoe,
I'm… I'm guessing that's off?

36:06.333 --> 36:07.541
I'm afraid so.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.958
I… I think she's just
really been through something.

36:11.041 --> 36:12.208
<i>Of course.</i>

36:12.291 --> 36:15.458
<i>Just look after yourself,</i>
<i>first and foremost, Gina. Okay?</i>

36:15.541 --> 36:18.458
<i>Don't get caught up in Leni's life.</i>
<i>You're your own person.</i>

36:18.541 --> 36:21.208
<i>Yeah, I'll be okay. Love you.</i>

36:42.833 --> 36:43.666
Hmm.

36:43.750 --> 36:48.083
Okay. Los Angeles,

36:48.166 --> 36:51.333
California, 90068.

36:51.416 --> 36:55.791
That wouldn't mean that you live
in the Hollywood Hills?

36:55.875 --> 36:56.958
It would.

36:57.833 --> 37:00.541
Not too shabby. I've been there once.

37:00.625 --> 37:04.000
Yeah… Yeah, I took one of them
double-decker tours,

37:04.083 --> 37:05.666
passed the stars, their houses.

37:05.750 --> 37:11.708
Oh! Beautiful weather. Exquisite houses.
You couldn't pay me to live there though.

37:12.583 --> 37:15.333
Is that all you needed?
My husband's name and our address?

37:15.416 --> 37:17.750
Just a… Just a few more questions.

37:17.833 --> 37:21.000
And, uh, this one's a little bit touchy,

37:21.083 --> 37:24.916
for some families,
at least, to talk money…

37:25.000 --> 37:27.291
But did you and your sister?

37:27.375 --> 37:29.791
-Uh, did we what?
-Talk money.

37:29.875 --> 37:34.333
More… More specifically,
did Jack or Leni ask you for money?

37:34.416 --> 37:35.666
No. Uh…

37:36.791 --> 37:37.875
They're too proud.

37:37.958 --> 37:41.666
Yeah. Jack, especially.
Yeah, they don't take our money.

37:41.750 --> 37:43.916
But, uh… And again, pardon me for asking,

37:44.000 --> 37:47.208
but, uh, not so proud
that they didn't let you pay

37:47.291 --> 37:49.666
for lavish birthday vacations every year?

37:49.750 --> 37:52.083
Where was it going to be this year?
Lake Tahoe?

37:52.166 --> 37:55.000
That's my… my birthday present to Leni.

37:55.083 --> 37:55.916
Huh.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.916
Yeah. Why is this, uh, relevant?

37:59.208 --> 38:01.500
How often do you and your sister talk?

38:01.583 --> 38:03.708
Or did you talk before?

38:04.541 --> 38:05.458
Every day.

38:05.541 --> 38:09.333
And she never mentioned
any financial stress?

38:09.416 --> 38:12.583
Nothing out of the ordinary
for a horse vet in a dying southern town.

38:13.166 --> 38:19.375
Uh, did you perhaps, uh, I don't know
the Hollywood term for this…

38:19.458 --> 38:22.083
Uh, brainstorm solutions? Pitch ideas?

38:22.166 --> 38:24.791
-Oh. What sorts of ideas?
-You tell me.

38:26.625 --> 38:28.291
Did you give her money?

38:30.083 --> 38:34.208
They wouldn't take our money.
Jack's too proud.

38:34.291 --> 38:36.750
Proud wasn't going
to pay the bank though, was it?

38:36.833 --> 38:39.375
People get pushed into corners,
they can surprise you.

38:39.458 --> 38:42.458
Yes, I am aware of that, yeah.
Are we done here, now?

38:43.166 --> 38:44.208
Uh…

38:45.541 --> 38:51.375
When you and Leni talk about the past,
what do you talk about?

38:52.458 --> 38:56.125
-Uh, what?
-You have so much incident in your lives.

38:56.208 --> 39:00.083
Uh, so much tragedy.
Do you ever talk about it?

39:00.666 --> 39:03.250
No. No, we try not to. Yeah.

39:04.041 --> 39:07.625
-But I do have a plane to catch. So--
-I really wish you'd stick around.

39:07.708 --> 39:11.750
We like having you around here again.
Keeps things interesting.

39:13.166 --> 39:15.750
Okay. Have a good one.

39:17.208 --> 39:18.458
Bye.

39:23.416 --> 39:24.541
How are you?

39:24.625 --> 39:27.750
Weird, but I'm here.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.000
Jack said you've been out
all day with Gina?

39:30.500 --> 39:33.125
I thought you'd be here resting
like the doctor said.

39:33.791 --> 39:34.666
She needed me.

39:34.750 --> 39:36.041
She needed <i>you?</i>

39:36.666 --> 39:40.083
After what you just been through? Typical.

39:40.166 --> 39:43.000
-Always making it about herself.
-Claud, come on.

39:43.083 --> 39:47.166
I know. But you're
the only one I can talk to

39:47.250 --> 39:49.958
and things have developed.

39:52.583 --> 39:53.833
What things?

39:53.916 --> 39:57.750
I know the timing is not great,
but I've been waiting to do it.

39:57.833 --> 39:59.166
And now that you're back,

40:00.125 --> 40:02.458
I'm thinking of bringing him
to dinner tonight.

40:04.666 --> 40:07.833
But Dad said he wanted to talk
and they haven't met yet either.

40:07.916 --> 40:09.041
-Of course.
-Of course.

40:09.125 --> 40:10.250
But maybe after.

40:10.333 --> 40:12.833
Are… You are coming tonight?

40:14.750 --> 40:17.666
I mean, if we have to deal
with just Gina, again--

40:17.750 --> 40:20.625
I'm gonna try to be there.
I promise, all right? I just…

40:21.208 --> 40:23.458
-I really need to get some rest.
-Of course.

40:25.291 --> 40:27.083
Fucking Gina.

40:36.208 --> 40:37.083
Hey.

40:38.166 --> 40:39.375
Where you going?

40:40.708 --> 40:45.333
I was, uh… I'm going to try and talk Gina
into coming to Dad's dinner tonight.

40:45.416 --> 40:48.041
And you couldn't have that conversation
on the phone?

40:51.208 --> 40:53.458
Shouldn't you spend
some time with your family?

40:53.541 --> 40:54.375
Uh…

40:55.250 --> 40:57.333
I'll be home soon. Okay?

40:58.875 --> 40:59.875
I promise.

41:06.291 --> 41:09.000
-Hey, we gotta get you cleaned up.

41:14.625 --> 41:17.208
You're leaving tomorrow? On your birthday?

41:18.041 --> 41:20.625
I mean, did something happen?

41:21.750 --> 41:22.625
No.

41:23.333 --> 41:24.416
No, Dad, I'm just

41:25.666 --> 41:28.333
headed back to LA
now that I know that Leni's fine.

41:30.708 --> 41:32.958
Are you rushing off
because you feel unwelcome here?

41:34.166 --> 41:36.583
Because Claudia and I have talked.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.083
And we want you always
to feel welcome here, don't we Claudia?

41:43.500 --> 41:44.916
Have you thought about Leni?

41:47.000 --> 41:47.958
She'll understand.

41:48.041 --> 41:49.708
She'd been through a trauma.

41:50.625 --> 41:52.416
It's more than that, though, isn't it?

41:54.375 --> 41:55.250
What…

41:56.833 --> 41:58.458
has she gone through this year?

42:01.083 --> 42:02.416
'Cause she's not talking to me.

42:03.083 --> 42:05.458
It's okay for her
to have boundaries, Gina.

42:05.541 --> 42:08.208
We don't have boundaries, Claudia.
We share everything.

42:08.291 --> 42:10.041
Nobody shares everything.

42:10.125 --> 42:13.750
You're never here and you have no idea
what she's going through.

42:13.833 --> 42:16.416
And you don't care
about anybody else's pain but your own.

42:16.500 --> 42:19.166
-Claudia, please.
-It's not true.

42:19.708 --> 42:23.666
It is true. And I know
because I fucking live it.

42:25.666 --> 42:26.625
Every day!

42:32.000 --> 42:34.875
-Sorry if I've been distant.
-You're not sorry at all.

42:34.958 --> 42:37.625
You come and go from here
like you own the place,

42:37.708 --> 42:40.041
but you have no idea what's going on here.

42:41.041 --> 42:44.666
And if things don't match up
exactly the way that you think it should,

42:44.750 --> 42:47.208
you only care about you and Leni.

42:47.291 --> 42:51.916
Well, there are
other people here too, Gina.

42:52.500 --> 42:54.083
There are other people hurting.

42:55.416 --> 42:57.291
Open your goddamn eyes.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.333
Dad.

43:08.750 --> 43:10.833
It's the reason I wanted you both here.

43:15.583 --> 43:16.750
I'm sick, G.

43:17.375 --> 43:22.666
They say I have, uh,
congestive heart failure. Late stage C or…

43:31.875 --> 43:32.833
Does, um…

43:35.291 --> 43:36.166
Does Leni know?

43:36.250 --> 43:37.583
No.

43:39.000 --> 43:42.958
No, they've been having financial issues
and I didn't want to burden her with this.

43:43.625 --> 43:47.208
Besides, like Claudia says,
nobody shares everything.

43:50.250 --> 43:52.875
But you're here now
and I really wanted to…

43:54.166 --> 43:55.708
To tell you both,

43:58.000 --> 44:00.375
but I got some results
from earlier this week.

44:03.833 --> 44:05.250
Before I go…

44:08.333 --> 44:09.791
I want us to unite.

44:10.708 --> 44:11.958
As a family.

44:13.166 --> 44:14.416
Please.

44:16.375 --> 44:18.416
Gina, stay.

44:19.958 --> 44:21.291
While we still have time.

44:22.333 --> 44:23.500
I'd like that.

44:24.375 --> 44:25.333
Of course.

44:27.416 --> 44:28.291
Yes.

44:49.958 --> 44:51.000
Dad.

44:51.083 --> 44:52.000
I can do that.

44:53.041 --> 44:53.875
Sit down.

45:34.625 --> 45:35.791
Where were you?

45:37.875 --> 45:41.208
I called down to the cottage.
They said you didn't show for dinner.

45:42.166 --> 45:43.458
I was at the inn.

45:45.500 --> 45:47.166
I, uh, fell asleep.

45:49.166 --> 45:51.708
Gina left me there
and had dinner with my dad.

45:57.625 --> 45:59.333
Did Gina tell you what happened?

46:03.166 --> 46:04.166
No.

46:11.041 --> 46:12.416
So are you gonna?

46:20.750 --> 46:23.083
Something happened with her
when you were gone.

46:26.291 --> 46:27.625
I was a bit drunk. I…

46:29.125 --> 46:30.708
I thought she was you at first.

46:33.666 --> 46:34.666
But then I didn't.

46:37.583 --> 46:38.583
It was a mistake.

46:39.833 --> 46:41.166
I am so sorry.

46:45.208 --> 46:47.583
It's Gina, Jack.

46:47.666 --> 46:48.500
No.

46:50.750 --> 46:52.875
No, I knew it wasn't you and I kept going.

46:55.333 --> 46:56.416
It's just…

46:59.708 --> 47:00.833
Something's broken.

47:06.166 --> 47:07.333
You…

47:07.875 --> 47:09.291
You stopped loving me.

47:11.208 --> 47:12.250
Maybe…

47:14.500 --> 47:15.750
Maybe me too.

47:17.708 --> 47:21.916
This past year. It's like you pulled away.

47:24.416 --> 47:25.875
I've never loved you more.

47:28.333 --> 47:30.208
-Is there someone else?
-No.

47:30.291 --> 47:31.291
Then what?

47:46.416 --> 47:48.750
-Where are you going?

47:49.791 --> 47:51.083
Back to the Riverside.

47:52.500 --> 47:55.083
Clearly there's a few things
I need to work out with Gina

47:55.166 --> 47:56.916
before her birthday in a half hour.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.083
You're running from me. Again.

48:00.125 --> 48:01.125
More secrets.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.416
-You really want me to stay?

48:06.166 --> 48:09.041
I need to figure this out with Gina
and get her back to LA.

48:09.125 --> 48:11.833
So you and I can fix what's broken.

48:14.916 --> 48:16.125
You think we can?

48:19.250 --> 48:20.541
I think we need to.

48:39.583 --> 48:42.750
You ever wonder
if you married the wrong sister?

48:46.041 --> 48:46.875
Never.

49:07.083 --> 49:09.291
<i>Another diary entry, Gina.</i>

49:10.125 --> 49:12.750
<i>I don't know what else to do,</i>
<i>so I'll just keep trying here.</i>

49:28.625 --> 49:29.958
<i>God damn it, Gina.</i>

49:30.541 --> 49:32.625
<i>You've destroyed everything.</i>

49:33.458 --> 49:37.125
<i>All that we built for years and years.</i>

49:37.708 --> 49:38.916
<i>Is it really that easy?</i>

49:39.708 --> 49:42.250
<i>Just to walk away</i>
<i>from everything that matters?</i>

49:45.083 --> 49:47.583
<i>How can you be back with Dylan James?</i>

49:48.250 --> 49:51.083
<i>He's nothing.</i>
<i>And you're nothing without me.</i>

50:17.083 --> 50:18.833
We've done enough damage.

50:18.916 --> 50:20.291
<i>Come home, Gina.</i>

50:22.041 --> 50:23.375
Let's make it right.

50:24.750 --> 50:25.666
Happy birthday.

50:27.208 --> 50:28.166
I love you.
