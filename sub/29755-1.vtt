if you want to enlighten me,
I'd really appreciate it.

-It's not good.
-What's not good?

09:49.323 --> 09:51.923
-I got the call.
-Ah, why didn't you just say so?

09:51.925 --> 09:55.594
-Well, in that case,
we'd really better go, huh?
-Yes, we must.

09:55.596 --> 09:58.764
-Perfect.
-You ready?

09:58.765 --> 10:01.933
No! Holy shit, weirdo! I'm gonna
stand up now. Is that okay?

No!

The Postal Service.

-Not exactly.

Let's get one thing straight.

10:57.224 --> 11:00.091
You seem to be
a relatively confused person,
and I'm all for that usually,

11:00.093 --> 11:02.394

most of the time.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.696
Hell, I think we naturally
probably had a pretty
good time last night

11:04.698 --> 11:07.032
considering how shitty
my head feels right now,

11:07.034 --> 11:10.201
and the increasingly
embarrassing fact
that I have no clothes on,

11:10.203 --> 11:14.305
but alas, I am
in no mood to play Twister
with you anymore,

11:14.307 --> 11:18.977
and frankly, I need
to grab my gear and need
to make it to Psych class in...

11:20.981 --> 11:23.882
Now.
So I'm gonna say this again.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.950
You're gonna let me
leave this room,

11:25.952 --> 11:28.286
and I'm gonna forget
this shit ever happened

11:28.288 --> 11:30.789
and spare you
the humiliation of campus police

11:30.791 --> 11:32.457
coming to bust your little
whatever that is!

11:36.830 --> 11:38.063
Armageddon.

11:38.432 --> 11:42.934
-Huh?
-Emergency survival gear.
I packed.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.936
-You packed?
-Yeah.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.772
-For Armageddon?
-To make it to the launch pad.

11:47.774 --> 11:51.142
-Launchpad?
-Yes, in Pasadena.
Outside Los Angeles.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.911
And who's outside?

11:52.913 --> 11:57.949

12:13.033 --> 12:17.936

I have an extra ticket, but
if you're not interested...

12:17.938 --> 12:19.871
I need a ticket? To where?

12:19.873 --> 12:23.908

-Who?
-I don't know, the mail guy?

16:12.539 --> 16:14.539
I knew they'd come.
I really have to go now.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.441
You can't leave me here.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.077
-Why not?
-Because.

16:19.446 --> 16:22.680
-Because why?
-Because...

16:29.589 --> 16:30.655
I'm pregnant.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.324
Ah, shit!

16:36.596 --> 16:37.562
Really?

16:38.398 --> 16:40.164
Yeah. Fuck!

16:40.166 --> 16:43.735

Suunnee's out back! Let's go!

17:07.627 --> 17:09.426
This is Suunnee.

17:09.429 --> 17:13.263
-This is your car?
-Yeah, it's my baby.
Why? What's wrong?

17:13.266 --> 17:16.634
-Are you okay?
-Am I okay? Are you okay?

17:17.270 --> 17:20.271
-First, how about
a little help here?
-Oops, sorry.

17:23.777 --> 17:27.412
[grunting]

17:28.715 --> 17:31.749
Oh! Ouch.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.419
Take off those goddamn
bug-eyed goggles.

17:35.321 --> 17:39.757
Are you honestly
making me carry around
a sex doll in an icebox?

17:41.828 --> 17:44.595
Careful. It's
a floatation device.

17:44.597 --> 17:48.199
Floatation? Seems awfully
anatomically correct
for a pool floaty.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.534
What are we,
going on vacation here?

17:49.536 --> 17:51.636
I don't know
if you're gonna understand.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.605
-Try me.
-Okay, if the universe we're in,
we're just one dimension.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.075
Based on my probability
calculations of the multiverse,

17:57.077 --> 18:00.545
there's an 18.46% chance
we're gonna need
this blood transfusion.

18:00.547 --> 18:05.383
And in an outcome,
14.75% chance we might
need the hot babe floaty,

18:05.385 --> 18:07.351
12.5%, the solar cells.

18:07.353 --> 18:09.620
Whoa whoa whoa,
slow down there, Einstein.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.190
I can barely understand
a word you're saying.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.758
-Multi what?
-Multiverse.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.460
-Multi hearse?
-Multiverse.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.795
-Purse?
-Verse. Multiple universe.

18:17.797 --> 18:20.398
Look, man, I don't even
remember having sex
with you last night,

18:20.400 --> 18:22.366
but I can assure you
it's not gonna happen again.

18:22.368 --> 18:24.569
Let alone multi-whatever-
you're-thinking.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.671
Multiverse. Quantum mechanics.

18:29.676 --> 18:33.678
-Wait, what major are you?
-Theoretical Physics.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.747
-What major are you?
-General Studies.

18:36.749 --> 18:37.849
What's that?

18:37.851 --> 18:42.420
It's a combination
of psychology, art, and music.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.106
That's fantastic.

18:45.107 --> 18:46.890
Look, brain queef, why are
we bringing a surfboard

18:46.893 --> 18:49.494
and do-it-yourself floatation
doll to some launch pad?

18:49.496 --> 18:51.696
Should I grab
my bikini and guitar?

18:51.698 --> 18:53.831
And where the fuck
is everybody, anyway?

18:55.135 --> 18:58.836
Look, Ms. General Studies,

18:58.838 --> 19:01.239
you clearly won't get this.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.307
-Educate me.
-Okay.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.644
Have you ever
heard of entanglement?

19:06.646 --> 19:08.713
You mean what I can't
remember what we did last night?

19:08.715 --> 19:12.383
Not that entanglement.
Spooky Action at a Distance.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.685
Jesus, man! It doesn't
matter if I'm near or far.

19:14.687 --> 19:18.456
-It's not happening again!
-Not necessarily.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.159
Time is an illusion.

19:21.161 --> 19:26.531
As far as we know it, it's never
actually not happening.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.400
Let me take it
from the top. All right.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.802
The first discoveries
of quantum physics

19:31.804 --> 19:34.705
were that the observation
itself creates changes

19:34.707 --> 19:38.676
in the outcome of the event,
but the future affects the past.

19:43.483 --> 19:48.419
Then Spooky Action
at a Distance Theory was
conceived of in the 1930s,

19:48.421 --> 19:50.688
and it wasn't
until 30 years later

19:50.690 --> 19:55.393
that Freedman and Clauser's
pioneering experiments
proved particles entangle.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.863
Almost like mirror
each other and therein,

19:58.865 --> 20:04.468
can relate like two
rolling dice that always land
on the same numbers.

20:04.470 --> 20:07.972
Even across space-time
at inconceivable distances.

20:08.675 --> 20:11.742
¶<i> Look at her...</i> ¶

20:11.744 --> 20:13.711
This is what makes
teleportation possible,

20:13.713 --> 20:15.813
which I wrote
my freshman thesis on.

20:15.815 --> 20:20.785
See, we can literally
jump dimensions if we deal
with it on a quantum level,

20:20.787 --> 20:23.221
particle by particle.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.489
Almost like stepping
through a wormhole.

20:25.491 --> 20:29.627
¶<i> Pour some science on her</i> ¶

20:29.629 --> 20:33.631
Boom, boom.
Here - there, instantaneously.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.634
Same place, same time, even.

20:36.636 --> 20:37.868
Boom, boom.

20:38.504 --> 20:39.437
So.

20:39.439 --> 20:45.876
If we can get to the launch pad
by November 11th,
at 11/11, 11:00 a.m.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.511
<i> we can get off this Earth.</i>

20:50.483 --> 20:52.783
We can meet my family
at International Space Station.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.952
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa, Thomas Edison.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.521
November 11th?
That's, like, in two weeks.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.323
Yeah. In this dream I had,

20:59.325 --> 21:01.592
my counselor
told me there are many ways
this could play out.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.728
In one,
I was told to bring this.

21:03.730 --> 21:07.398
In another, we might need this.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.901
-In another, we might need this.
-Told by who, McGillicutty?

21:10.903 --> 21:12.436
The counselor.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.939
Oh, good.
That's a little better.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.342
I was hoping we wouldn't go
too far without talking
to a specialist.

21:18.344 --> 21:19.343
Good.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.915
Where is this counselor?

21:26.486 --> 21:30.288
You see yours when you're
meant to see yours.

21:33.459 --> 21:37.528
I'd like to see
a counselor right now.
Right fucking now.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.563
You should've
kept your pants on, Kara.

21:39.565 --> 21:42.433
You should've kept
your god damn pants on!

21:42.869 --> 21:44.886
Sister Mary had it right.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.904
Maybe complete abstinence
is better than perfect
moderation.

21:47.573 --> 21:50.308
Maybe this is the lesson
I'm finally meant to learn.

21:50.943 --> 21:51.942
Whatever.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.478
Holy shit!

21:56.416 --> 21:58.516
Holy shit!

21:58.518 --> 22:00.618
Where the fuck is Bernie?

22:00.620 --> 22:03.888
-Who?
-Bernie, my purse.

22:04.791 --> 22:07.825
I had him when we left,
and then you made me carry
all this stupid shit,

22:08.561 --> 22:09.760
and the strap probably broke.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.796
-Blame it on me now--
-Fucking...

22:35.355 --> 22:36.354
[sighs]

23:08.821 --> 23:12.790
[wave sound]

23:14.093 --> 23:17.094
Wow, what the fuck was that?

23:17.096 --> 23:19.463
Sounded like
a gravitational ripple.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.766
-Cool.
-A wha-?

23:21.768 --> 23:25.403
Two black holes
collided 4 billion years ago.

23:26.873 --> 23:29.807
-I was expecting that last week.
-But it came from over there.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.442
-No, it didn't.
-Yes, it did.

23:31.444 --> 23:33.778
-Not necessarily.
-Oh, whatever.

23:37.049 --> 23:39.500
I'll be right back.

23:39.501 --> 23:41.952
Just remember,
if you go around that corner,

23:41.954 --> 23:44.855
we may not be in the same
dimension anymore.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.624
Well, I gotta get Bernie.

24:08.648 --> 24:09.814
There you are.

24:19.992 --> 24:22.893
[agent] <i> Agent 1,</i>
<i> they are out of the room.</i>
<i> You are clear to proceed.</i>

26:10.169 --> 26:11.101
Hey.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.737
-Huh?
-Do you need some help?

26:14.106 --> 26:15.940
Oh, yeah, sure, thanks, man.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.184
I figure we need
to get some food.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.986
I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.821
Yeah, I could
really go for some food.

26:30.823 --> 26:33.591
-What are you in the mood for?
-Uh, anything healthy.

26:33.593 --> 26:36.994
Me too. I'm on this diet.
I'm at 8.2% body fat,

26:36.996 --> 26:39.863
and I have to go below
5% to match Brad Pitt
in <i> Fight Club</i> .

26:40.733 --> 26:44.168
-Well, why is that, exactly?
-I'm shooting a music video.

26:44.170 --> 26:47.738
-You-- you're a musician?
-Oh, yeah.

26:49.141 --> 26:51.342
-What kind of music?
-I'm a rapper.

27:08.961 --> 27:12.863
Music is the common language
of vibration energy.

27:13.366 --> 27:15.065
It bonds us.

27:15.067 --> 27:18.302
It transcends us into
higher versions of ourselves.

27:19.372 --> 27:25.075
Creativity itself,
quite literally is
the intersection of dimensions.

27:25.077 --> 27:28.312
We're gonna need it
where we're going!

28:57.203 --> 29:01.138
-Oh, I got that.
-Okay, take it easy.

29:01.140 --> 29:05.442
-Okay, you just
need to be careful.
-Just trying to be helpful.

29:06.112 --> 29:10.147
Thank you. Get in.
I'll take care of Tank.

29:13.018 --> 29:14.218
Okay.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.875
Uh... What the fuck is this?

29:37.877 --> 29:38.909
It's a mini fridge.

29:40.012 --> 29:42.913
-What for?
-Drinks.

29:42.915 --> 29:45.516
-For when you drive?
-Oh, God, no.
I don't drink and drive.

29:45.518 --> 29:49.119
-So this is for guests?
-Of course.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.941
I figure if I'm gonna drive,
I'm gonna have style.

30:10.943 --> 30:14.545
I always wanted
a muscle car. Ready?

30:17.583 --> 30:20.818
[engine revs]

31:04.897 --> 31:08.999
Salvia was a secret plant.
They were hiding it
for a real long time.

31:09.001 --> 31:11.635
-Who was?
-The government and the tribes.

31:13.305 --> 31:17.174
It's known
as Sage of the Diviners.
Ska Maria Pastora.

31:17.176 --> 31:20.878
Seared sage is believed
to be an incarnation
of the Virgin Mary.

31:22.181 --> 31:25.415
Mazatec shamans
use it for religious purposes.

31:25.417 --> 31:28.585
Its natural habitat
is in the cloud force

31:28.587 --> 31:32.055
in the isolated Sierra Mazateca
of Oaxaca, Mexico,

31:33.192 --> 31:36.093
but it's really believed
to be brought to the planet...

31:37.062 --> 31:40.330
not to have,
like, originated here.

31:41.667 --> 31:45.535
-Why?
-Because its reproductive system
is so different.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.271
It's very hard to figure out.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.439
It's, like, it was
just one plant found,

31:49.441 --> 31:52.676
like it was
a four-dimensional... accident

31:52.678 --> 31:55.112
that just slipped out
or crashed on some asteroid.

31:55.614 --> 31:59.182
Either way,
I think it caused my DR.

31:59.184 --> 32:02.052
-Your what?
-Derealization.

32:02.054 --> 32:05.522
-What's that?
-It's like being
stoned all the time.

32:07.092 --> 32:11.328
I'm very sensitive to light.
I have panic attacks.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.931
It could be
neurological or psychological.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.499
How many times did you do it?

32:16.468 --> 32:18.235
Salvia? Three or four times.

32:18.237 --> 32:21.338
-Wow.
-You lose
a thousand years in your mind.

32:21.340 --> 32:24.241
There's no time limit.
That's the problem.

32:24.243 --> 32:27.311
Just like it should be
in fourth dimension. All is one.

32:27.313 --> 32:29.479
Gravitational force
is tearing you apart.

32:29.481 --> 32:33.150
Eventually, it takes, like,
15 minutes to get back
to your reality.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.621
And it was so crazy.
I took another dose right away.

32:37.623 --> 32:42.125
I needed to figure it out,
so I took 120 extract.

32:42.594 --> 32:45.228
-People usually do five.
-Oh, whoa!

32:55.541 --> 32:59.042
[man] <i> The spirit</i>
<i> of Salvia is always a woman,</i>

32:59.044 --> 33:03.013
<i> and I experienced a cube</i>
<i> in a cube in a cube situation.</i>

33:03.015 --> 33:05.148
<i> I get pushed away</i>
<i> from the future.</i>

33:05.150 --> 33:08.251
<i> You think that you</i>
<i> can never come back,</i>
<i> that you're stuck.</i>

33:08.253 --> 33:11.755
<i> You also become objects,</i>
<i> like a person's shoe</i>

33:11.757 --> 33:14.691
<i> or something quantizable.</i>

33:40.753 --> 33:44.421
-[beep]
-[agent] <i> Agent 1, terminate</i>
<i> search. Pursue the target.</i>

33:44.423 --> 33:46.323
<i> Sending new coordinates now.</i>

33:55.134 --> 33:59.803
[man] <i> And then... I was</i>
<i> there, at the source.</i>

34:00.773 --> 34:02.572
<i> All was one.</i>

34:04.710 --> 34:06.410
<i> Singularity...</i>

34:08.147 --> 34:10.112
<i> Until I started sweeping back.</i>

34:10.114 --> 34:12.783
<i> When you come back,</i>
<i> you come back part by part.</i>

34:12.784 --> 34:17.621
<i> You feel an insane pull</i>
<i> of something else different</i>
<i> at the top of your head.</i>

34:17.623 --> 34:21.792
<i> Like a connection</i>
<i> to the Cosmo, and you have</i>
<i> no idea what's going on.</i>

34:21.793 --> 34:24.226
<i> Because when you're on it,</i>
<i> you have no idea.</i>

34:24.228 --> 34:26.780
<i> You don't remember</i>
<i> you smoking it.</i>

34:26.781 --> 34:29.331
<i> Eventually, it takes, like,</i>
<i> 15 minutes to get back</i>
<i> to yourself.</i>

34:29.333 --> 34:33.770
And everyone goes
to the same place
when you're on salvia.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.106
Everyone sees the same stuff.

34:36.809 --> 34:39.810
-Really?
-Yeah.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.780
Everyone who does it describes
the same kind of thing.

34:43.782 --> 34:46.516
<i> The woman. The cubes.</i>

34:48.554 --> 34:49.619
No way.

34:53.225 --> 34:58.261
Yeah. I almost wish I never
smoked it in my entire life.

34:58.263 --> 35:03.200
Yet, I cannot
name anything that has
been as profound as that.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.136
Where'd you get it?

35:11.443 --> 35:14.744
The deep web. The vinyl highway.

35:14.746 --> 35:18.248
Once you smoke it...
the doors open.

35:19.751 --> 35:23.687
It's not like LSD.
Once you have it,
you can never take it back.

35:23.689 --> 35:26.223
The door cannot be shut.

35:27.259 --> 35:30.327
-No ticket back?
-No round-trip ticket.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.430
No round-trip ticket?

35:33.832 --> 35:37.901
And do not operate
mechanical machinery
while on it.

35:39.671 --> 35:43.473
You have to have a sitter.
You can't do it by yourself.

35:43.475 --> 35:47.177
Perceptions are gone.
You're not seeing anything.

35:48.514 --> 35:53.583
Excessive laughter and crying.
Both at the same time.

35:53.585 --> 35:56.686
-Drooling.
-Drooling?

35:57.556 --> 35:58.488
Ick.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.626
Ah, dude? We have to go.

36:08.333 --> 36:13.703
[tires screeching]

36:24.416 --> 36:25.916
Woah!

36:28.620 --> 36:32.522
Man, don't worry.
I'm a perfect driver.
I never had a speeding ticket.

37:10.395 --> 37:11.728
[man] <i> Ah, damn it.</i>

37:11.730 --> 37:13.263
What's wrong?

37:13.699 --> 37:14.965
I forgot something.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.267
[tires screeching]

37:23.375 --> 37:25.342
What? What are you doing?

37:25.344 --> 37:27.244
It's fine. It will
take me a second.

37:27.246 --> 37:30.013
You're literally
out of your mind.
The mail guy is there.

37:30.015 --> 37:32.649
-No, no, it's fine.
-No, no, it's not fine!

37:50.269 --> 37:52.736
-Holy shit!
-What?

37:52.738 --> 37:56.539
-That's... Him!
-What?

37:56.908 --> 38:00.310
-Gun it!
-I can't do that.
It would be very dangerous.

38:00.312 --> 38:01.678
Gun. It.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.014
Don't you see?

38:05.284 --> 38:07.651
-Don't you see?
-See what?

38:10.656 --> 38:11.888
[groaning]

38:20.866 --> 38:22.732
-[tires screeching]
-Oh.

38:23.602 --> 38:26.569
-[man] What the fuck, man?
-What the fuck?

38:26.571 --> 38:30.473
What the fuck? What the fuck?
What the fuck was that?

38:30.942 --> 38:34.377
[man] Jesus. You almost shot
us through space-time.

38:34.946 --> 38:39.549
Are you insane?
You're insane. He's insane.

38:40.018 --> 38:43.086
Or maybe he's on salvia.
Or maybe I'm on salvia.

38:43.088 --> 38:44.721
Did you give me salvia?

38:44.723 --> 38:47.991
Everybody needs
to calm the fuck down.

38:48.560 --> 38:54.364
He's coming. He's coming.
He is on his way here.

38:54.366 --> 38:57.867
Everything's fine.
I have no idea what you're
freaking out about.

38:57.869 --> 39:02.038
What I'm freaking out about?
Your little head
got me into this mess.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.940
Your big head better get me out!

39:05.377 --> 39:09.646
Okay. Fine. Forget about it.
I don't need to get it anyway.

39:28.533 --> 39:32.001
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

39:32.003 --> 39:34.938
[girl] Oh, my God,
oh, my God, Oh, my God!

39:50.856 --> 39:55.024
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God! Jesus...

39:55.927 --> 39:58.561
I know.
I know it's been a while.

39:58.563 --> 40:02.732
Don't be mad. Like, a long time.

40:02.734 --> 40:05.969
-What? We're fine.
-Do not tell me we are fine!

40:05.971 --> 40:09.472
I don't know why you're
so worked up. I mean,
it's not that big a deal.

40:09.474 --> 40:12.409
What in the Holy Grail
are you talking about?

40:12.411 --> 40:14.110
Did you not see him?

40:14.780 --> 40:16.880
-See who?
-Your mail dude. Whatever.

40:16.882 --> 40:19.983
-You mean
you saw the Postal Service?
-Yes!

40:19.985 --> 40:25.488
-You saw the Postal Service?
-Yeah, I saw the guy.

40:26.525 --> 40:27.624
What did he look like?

40:29.027 --> 40:33.596
He looked like... like a guy.

40:33.598 --> 40:36.199
-That's good. Very general.
-He's like an agent guy!

40:36.201 --> 40:38.701
-Like an agent?
-Yeah, you know?

40:38.703 --> 40:42.071
-Like, with that look.
-That look like...?

40:42.841 --> 40:46.142
-The Terminatrix look.
-Wow.

40:46.845 --> 40:49.078
-Fuck wow!
-Interesting.

40:49.748 --> 40:52.682
Interesting? Aren't you
trying to avoid them?

40:52.684 --> 40:55.218
Like, for Armageddon reasons?

40:55.220 --> 40:57.754
-No.
-No?

41:01.059 --> 41:02.559
Do you mind if I smoke?

41:03.462 --> 41:04.561
-No.
-Great.

41:11.570 --> 41:14.737
No, yes,
I mind if you fucking smoke!

41:14.739 --> 41:16.806
No? No?

41:17.509 --> 41:21.110
-You're not trying
to run from the agent guy?
-No. Why would I do that?

41:25.016 --> 41:27.484
Correct me
if I'm wrong here, Einstein.

41:28.553 --> 41:30.987
Does the sexy guy
in the cool glasses

41:30.989 --> 41:34.057
have anything to do
with our mission
to get across the county?

41:34.659 --> 41:40.530
-Probably.
-And what exactly is his
probable role in this equation?

41:41.066 --> 41:44.934
I don't know. He probably has
a high probability
of being your counselor.

41:44.936 --> 41:48.238
Oh, my counselor?
Why is he my counselor?

41:48.240 --> 41:51.207
I don't know.
You saw him. I didn't.

41:51.977 --> 41:54.644
Which makes me
to believe that like I said,

41:54.646 --> 42:00.183
what reality you're
living in is yours,
and what I'm in is mine.

42:00.185 --> 42:04.220
Has anyone ever told you
that you're not exactly
right in the head?

42:04.756 --> 42:06.289
Singularity is within, man.

42:06.291 --> 42:09.225
-The sooner you--
-You let me out
of this fucking car!

42:09.227 --> 42:11.528
-Whoa!
-Let me out!

42:11.530 --> 42:14.664
-Okay, okay, okay.
-Let me out! Let me out!

42:20.105 --> 42:25.208
Like, like... oh! Oh! Like...

42:25.210 --> 42:28.311
I just-- I just need to-- I...

42:30.181 --> 42:32.749
-Get off of me!
-Ah, okay, okay, okay!

42:34.119 --> 42:37.620
This is, like--
this is, like, it?

42:38.189 --> 42:40.023
I mean, is he my punishment?

42:40.692 --> 42:43.660
'Cause I didn't
treat Mom and Dad with respect?

42:44.763 --> 42:49.232
Dad was always an asshole,
and Mom, she just did it
for the money, right?

42:51.002 --> 42:54.237
I didn't want to find
their smutty videos

42:54.239 --> 42:56.773
in the VCR player
Christmas morning!

42:56.775 --> 43:00.777
I didn't ask to be
stuck between their fucked
up battles of infidelity

43:01.246 --> 43:04.347
and I needed glasses
way before 8th grade!

43:06.952 --> 43:08.718
You want me to repent?

43:11.289 --> 43:13.323
Am I supposed to confess?

43:14.593 --> 43:15.325
How?

43:15.327 --> 43:19.028
There's nobody left
to confess to!

43:20.098 --> 43:26.169
And even if there was, I mean,
it's not my fault I was
made this way, God!

43:26.905 --> 43:28.905
They put me in Catholic School,

43:29.841 --> 43:33.876
which if you haven't
been paying attention,
is fucked up!

43:35.981 --> 43:41.017
You think I wanted
to have my virginity taken
by a dirty priest at 15?

43:42.387 --> 43:44.788
I didn't taunt him.

43:44.789 --> 43:47.190
They made us wear these
little skirts and knee socks.

43:48.994 --> 43:50.960
Sick, twisted fucks.

43:53.865 --> 43:56.065
-It's a good look.
-Shut up!

43:57.936 --> 44:01.671
Sure, there's a little
part of me that liked it.

44:04.776 --> 44:06.009
But isn't that what you do?

44:07.779 --> 44:10.713
You put us in these
shitty situations...

44:12.651 --> 44:14.183
that we have to
fucking deal with?

44:14.185 --> 44:18.788
That are impossible
to begin with, and then
you give us the choice?

44:18.790 --> 44:20.890
Do good or evil.

44:23.294 --> 44:28.031
Well, let me say this again:
Go fuck yourself!

44:28.033 --> 44:29.666
[echoing] Fuck yourself!

44:29.668 --> 44:33.269
I've had just about enough
of the cards I've been dealt,

44:34.673 --> 44:37.106
and now you give me this guy?

44:39.778 --> 44:40.943
No disrespect.

44:41.880 --> 44:43.446
You don't look like Satan.

44:44.683 --> 44:47.884
I figured he'd be a little bit
sexier than you!

44:51.389 --> 44:53.189
But that's the joke, right?

44:55.093 --> 44:58.161
It's like tailored to me.
It's so specific.

45:01.232 --> 45:04.400
I get it. This is Hell.

45:07.072 --> 45:10.239
You can tell me.
This is it, isn't it?

45:10.241 --> 45:12.141
Well, I can't
tell you that for sure,

45:12.143 --> 45:14.944
but I'd rather not
get into religion
with you right now, okay?

45:16.047 --> 45:18.748
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're right.

45:20.085 --> 45:21.718
Let's not talk about God.

45:23.021 --> 45:24.454
Let's not talk about God.

45:25.890 --> 45:28.324
-What are we going to do?
-Yeah, good, okay.

45:28.326 --> 45:32.462
What we're gonna do is,
we're gonna get back
into Suunnee,

45:33.164 --> 45:35.398
-and we're gonna drive.
-Oh, we're gonna drive?

45:35.400 --> 45:38.434
Where are we gonna drive?
To Pasadena?

45:38.436 --> 45:41.204
-Yeah.
-If we're gonna drive,
then I want--

45:41.206 --> 45:43.973
I want-- I want my guitar.

45:43.975 --> 45:48.444
If I am gonna
have to do this with you,
I need my guitar.

45:48.446 --> 45:49.979
Oh, sure.

45:51.216 --> 45:54.817
We need your guitar.
I didn't know you played guitar.

45:55.286 --> 45:56.219
Yeah, I do.

45:56.221 --> 46:00.490
-I'm a singer/songwriter.
-You're a singer/songwriter?

46:00.492 --> 46:05.328
-I am.
-Like, uh, Taylor Swift?

46:05.330 --> 46:07.530
No, not like Taylor Swift.

46:09.100 --> 46:12.168
Not like bad Taylor Swift. Why?
What's wrong with Taylor Swift?

46:12.170 --> 46:18.007
It's nothing, nothing. It's
nothing personal. It's just,
uh, not my thing, that's all.

46:18.009 --> 46:20.343
You know, just don't.
Just get back in the car.

46:20.345 --> 46:22.328
-Okay, well--
-Get back in the car!

46:22.329 --> 46:24.312
-Just get back in the goddamn
car and just let me...
-What'd I say?

46:24.315 --> 46:26.082
-What'd you say?
-What'd I say?

46:26.084 --> 46:30.453
-What'd I say?
-What'd you say?
What'd you say? Amazing!

46:30.455 --> 46:32.021
[woman] Just kill it!

46:33.258 --> 46:36.893
-What the fuck is that sound?
-The bowling ball.

46:39.964 --> 46:43.499
-You mean my brain.
-I'm sorry, man.

46:44.135 --> 46:46.869
The first few times
I tried to wrap my head
around quantum theory,

46:46.871 --> 46:48.888
it's, like, crazy, man.

46:48.889 --> 46:50.906
They say if you think
you understand it, you don't.

46:50.909 --> 46:52.975
And I was just
trying to make small talk.

46:52.977 --> 46:58.481
So give this to me again.
Do you or do you not see
the car following us?

47:01.986 --> 47:04.187
-I'm sorry.
-You don't?

47:04.189 --> 47:07.156
It's true. Unless I'm tripping,
or maybe you are.

47:07.158 --> 47:09.826
If that's the case, it'd be
a good time to share it.

47:14.499 --> 47:16.933
Okay, so I'm
officially losing it.

47:16.935 --> 47:18.935
No, I tried
to explain this to you.

47:18.937 --> 47:23.005
I'm gonna listen
again. I'm gonna listen.

47:24.943 --> 47:26.008
Go ahead.

47:48.099 --> 47:50.499
[upbeat music]

47:50.501 --> 47:53.202
[slow tempo music]

47:53.204 --> 47:56.639
¶<i> I love you</i> ¶

47:58.142 --> 48:01.410
-[song] ¶<i> From</i>
<i> The first time I met you</i> ¶
-¶<i> I love you</i> ¶

48:01.412 --> 48:04.013
-[song] ¶<i> The second time</i>
<i> I met you...</i> ¶
-[holding note]

48:04.015 --> 48:08.017
So like I said,
it's got nothing to do
with me or my reality.

48:09.254 --> 48:12.421
Ah, yes, multiverse.

48:14.993 --> 48:18.227
-So who are you running from?
-Nobody.

48:26.604 --> 48:32.108
But you said to go
and to stay out of the light
and the mailman.

48:32.110 --> 48:34.110
The Postal Service?

48:34.111 --> 48:36.111
Yeah, he needs to be avoided.
I hate getting bills.

48:36.114 --> 48:38.447
Bills? Like, credit card bills?

48:38.449 --> 48:43.252
No,
last time I got the mail,
I got a recall notice on my car,

48:44.055 --> 48:46.022
and I can't give Suunnee up.

48:46.024 --> 48:49.659
I mean, I'm just trying to get
to the launch pad on time.

48:49.661 --> 48:51.560
Will you stay out of the light?

48:51.562 --> 48:53.095
Don't let them see you.

48:53.097 --> 48:54.747
Launchpad.

48:54.748 --> 48:56.398
Emergency survival
gear. I packed.

48:58.169 --> 49:00.670
It could be
neurological or psychological.

49:00.672 --> 49:03.973
...and meet my family,
and you're pregnant,

49:03.975 --> 49:08.110
and I'm not leaving my baby mama
and future offspring
on the dying Earth.

49:08.546 --> 49:11.614
I am not
fucking pregnant, you dip!

49:17.388 --> 49:21.624
[tires screeching]

49:26.397 --> 49:30.166
-You lied to me?
-Lied to you? Yes!

49:34.539 --> 49:37.640
You lied to me. That's, like...

49:39.043 --> 49:40.476
The worst thing you can do.

49:41.479 --> 49:43.012
Are you out of your mind?

49:47.218 --> 49:51.520
It's okay. This is good news.

49:51.522 --> 49:54.023
I'm on the pill
for just this reason.

49:55.193 --> 49:56.325
Good news?

49:57.595 --> 49:58.527
Yeah.

49:58.529 --> 50:02.064
Though, it does cause
some erratic mood swings.

50:03.001 --> 50:04.567
I might change the prescription.

50:06.671 --> 50:09.405
I thought I
was going to be a dad.

50:11.142 --> 50:13.676
Uh, oh, man.

50:14.746 --> 50:16.045
Well, I'm sorry.

50:17.448 --> 50:18.714
Are you serious?

50:21.085 --> 50:22.451
Yeah, I'm serious.

50:24.455 --> 50:25.388
Oh.

50:28.126 --> 50:29.058
I, uh...

50:30.795 --> 50:31.727
I...

50:35.199 --> 50:37.233
I just said that so you'd
take me with you.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.504
All you had to do was ask.

50:41.506 --> 50:46.409
[man thinking] <i> I gotta take</i>
<i> my meds. I gotta take my meds.</i>
<i> I gotta take a half.</i>

50:47.545 --> 50:51.047
<i> I gotta take my meds.</i>
<i> I gotta take my meds.</i>
<i> I gotta take a half.</i>

50:51.049 --> 50:55.317
<i> No, I gotta take a whole pill.</i>
<i> I gotta take my meds.</i>
<i> I gotta take my meds.</i>

51:08.733 --> 51:13.069
-So can I still use that ticket?
-Yeah, not that important.

51:13.638 --> 51:15.504
So I don't need a ticket?

51:16.274 --> 51:17.840
Not that paper ticket, anyway.

51:17.842 --> 51:20.576
Besides, I have most important
trip tickets in the fridge.

51:23.781 --> 51:25.448
Let me ask you something.

51:26.384 --> 51:27.316
Shoot.

51:27.318 --> 51:29.718
You don't see
that guy right there?

51:35.660 --> 51:37.293
Interesting.

51:37.295 --> 51:40.463
-You do?
-I do.

51:41.099 --> 51:41.864
Ha!

51:41.866 --> 51:44.834
-Holy shit!
-Ah-ha!

51:44.836 --> 51:49.338
-[engine revs]
-[screaming]

51:59.217 --> 52:01.150
[air hissing]

52:01.152 --> 52:04.386
[screaming]

52:04.388 --> 52:07.690
[engine revs]

52:07.692 --> 52:08.858
Fuck!

52:08.860 --> 52:12.895
-I think I get it!
I think I get it!
-What? What the fuck do you get?

52:12.897 --> 52:15.498
-It makes sense.
-None of this makes any sense.

52:15.500 --> 52:18.234
-Oh, it makes perfect sense.
-Tell me, Einstein.

52:18.236 --> 52:20.736
-Tell me what you have on this!
-That's exactly right.

52:20.738 --> 52:22.771
Einstein couldn't get it,
but I think I did.

52:22.773 --> 52:25.641
-What are you fucking
talking about?
-Multiverse.

52:25.643 --> 52:27.643
Quantum Mechanics
versus Relativity.

52:27.645 --> 52:29.645
Shut up and say something
that makes sense!

52:29.647 --> 52:32.164
Okay, listen,
this is what you gotta know.

52:32.165 --> 52:34.682
About a hundred years ago,
Einstein turned everything
in physics on its ass

52:34.685 --> 52:37.620
with his theory of relativity.
And that had to do
with time and space,

52:37.622 --> 52:39.255
kind of being the same thing.

52:39.257 --> 52:41.857
[voice] <i> Space-time! Space-time!</i>

52:41.859 --> 52:44.260
[man] <i> Meanwhile, there were</i>
<i> these other physicists</i>

52:44.262 --> 52:46.829
<i> dealing with probability</i>
<i> and working at completely</i>
<i> different math.</i>

52:46.831 --> 52:49.498
<i> Like, radically different,</i>
<i> and logic as you know it</i>

52:49.500 --> 52:52.084
<i>was just thrown out the window.</i>

52:52.085 --> 52:54.669
<i> So much that Einstein</i>
<i> himself was plagued</i>
<i> by the entire notion.</i>

52:54.672 --> 52:57.173
<i> Anguished by how two</i>
<i> diametrically opposed theories</i>

52:57.175 --> 52:59.608
<i> about how the world</i>
<i> works could coexist.</i>

52:59.610 --> 53:03.179
<i> Quantum,</i>
<i> the world of the small</i>
<i> and our everyday reality.</i>

53:03.181 --> 53:05.915
<i> The sort of big:</i>
<i> Us, planets, etcetera.</i>

53:05.917 --> 53:08.317
<i> Gravity and space</i>
<i> and all that theorizing</i>

53:08.319 --> 53:11.820
<i> led us to this strange,</i>
<i> troubling problem</i>
<i> that exists today.</i>

53:11.822 --> 53:15.824
<i> The laws of the small</i>
<i> do not connect up</i>
<i> to the laws of the large.</i>

53:16.427 --> 53:21.830
And the small,
the quantum theory, has never,
ever, been proven wrong.

53:22.567 --> 53:25.301
So where does that leave us?

53:25.903 --> 53:28.571
The mysterious Linchpin
of the whole Standard Model!

53:28.573 --> 53:30.706
The standard particle itself
was just discovered,

53:31.342 --> 53:34.777
which brings us
to super symmetry
versus the multiverse.

53:34.779 --> 53:38.380
-Oh, here we go again!
-No, quite the opposite.

53:38.382 --> 53:41.167
On one side is
the multiverse concept.

53:41.168 --> 53:43.953
The google the possible
probable outcomes of every
little energy molecule.

53:43.955 --> 53:46.255
The google of yous
and versions of your life,

53:46.257 --> 53:48.857
theoretically live in totally
different realities.

53:48.859 --> 53:52.361
Just the idea of self makes
life feel completely
random and pointless.

53:52.363 --> 53:55.231
Then, and here's
where it gets interesting.

53:55.233 --> 53:57.266
It's already interesting enough!

53:57.268 --> 53:59.768
On the other side,
with super symmetry,

53:59.770 --> 54:03.939
everything is
in this almost improbable
inconceivable harmony.

54:03.941 --> 54:05.874
A miracle of specificity.

54:05.876 --> 54:09.478
A truly enlightening equilibrium
that only leads us to think

54:09.480 --> 54:13.983
that the universe
must be a product
of intelligent design: God!

54:17.355 --> 54:19.755
-There is a god?
-That's hard to say.

54:19.757 --> 54:23.459
Some people call the Higgs
boson particle God, yes.

54:23.461 --> 54:27.429
-So I am in Hell?
-Uh, maybe, but it's okay.

54:27.431 --> 54:29.898
-I think I solved it.
-You solved it?

54:29.900 --> 54:32.034
-The connection.
-Between what?

54:32.036 --> 54:33.836
The quantum
and classical theories.

54:34.438 --> 54:36.438
-You did?
-I did.

54:37.541 --> 54:39.808
At least... I think I did.

54:40.645 --> 54:41.777
[man] <i> I was wasted.</i>

54:41.779 --> 54:46.282
<i> Using the new</i>
<i> Higgs boson weight</i>
<i> to finish my senior equation.</i>

54:46.284 --> 54:49.952
<i> And then I stood up and went</i>
<i>to the bathroom to take a dump.</i>

54:50.655 --> 54:53.555
Then, it hit me.

54:53.557 --> 54:55.024
¶<i> Hallelujah</i> ¶

54:55.026 --> 54:56.725
-It hit you?
-Yeah.

54:56.727 --> 54:59.395
-On the toilet?
-Yes.

54:59.997 --> 55:05.634
What Einstein couldn't
figure out, you did
while taking a dump?

55:05.636 --> 55:09.705
[grunting]

55:09.707 --> 55:14.743
[action movie music]

55:22.853 --> 55:24.887
Is that a periscope?

55:24.889 --> 55:27.723
-Kind of.
-Did you make it yourself?

55:27.725 --> 55:28.757
Yeah, how'd you guess?

55:28.759 --> 55:30.092
You got a little, uh...

55:31.796 --> 55:32.728
Mm.

55:34.065 --> 55:35.798
Anyway, when I was
on the toilet,

55:35.800 --> 55:39.034
I remember feeling
this giant wave of energy

55:39.036 --> 55:42.905
just rush through me
like a moment of uniformity.

55:42.907 --> 55:45.541
I was everywhere
in the same place,
like, the same time.

55:45.543 --> 55:47.509
<i> The whole universe</i>
<i> and I were one.</i>

55:47.511 --> 55:50.746
I took a deep breath,
and then-- and then imploded.

55:50.748 --> 55:53.515
-[farting]
-[woman] <i> You imploded</i>
<i> with the universe?</i>

55:53.517 --> 55:54.917
[man] <i> Yeah,</i>
<i> like I had sex with her.</i>

55:55.586 --> 55:58.454
You had sex with the universe?

55:58.456 --> 56:00.956
Yeah, see, the crazy thing is,

56:00.958 --> 56:04.927
all we know only makes 5%
of the entire value
of the universe.

56:04.929 --> 56:09.398
Now, with the Higgs weight,
I can solve my senior equation,

56:09.400 --> 56:11.834
which all comes down
to dark matter.

56:12.436 --> 56:15.070
-Is that, like, Darth Vader?
-Kind of.

56:15.072 --> 56:17.539
And it's negative. Dark energy.

56:17.541 --> 56:20.075
-Is that like the force?
-Yes!
We don't know what they are.

56:20.077 --> 56:22.811
The Higgs and weight
of the God Particle
was the missing clue.

56:22.813 --> 56:24.980
Now, I'm using it
to calculate the probability

56:24.982 --> 56:27.015
of the Big Crunch
or the Big Rip.

56:27.017 --> 56:28.384
Is that like gas?

56:28.386 --> 56:30.018
It's how the universe ends.

56:30.020 --> 56:32.821
It's either a squish or a poof,

56:32.823 --> 56:34.423
and I wrote it down and then...

56:36.560 --> 56:40.028
Huh? I must've been right!

56:40.030 --> 56:43.399
Why?

56:43.400 --> 56:46.769
Because my calculation
was an observation
that changed the outcome.

56:47.872 --> 56:50.105
Now, instead of being
in the center of the equilibrium

56:50.107 --> 56:52.574
between super symmetry
and the multiverse...

56:55.179 --> 56:57.613
The worst possible
thing has happened.

56:57.615 --> 57:00.449
The multiverse itself
is entangled!

57:03.487 --> 57:06.522
[woman]
<i> The multiverse has entangled.</i>

57:06.524 --> 57:07.790
Nice.

57:07.792 --> 57:11.493
Now, all I have to do
is figure out what he wants.

57:11.495 --> 57:14.496
Well, maybe we should
just ask him.

57:14.498 --> 57:18.500
-Huh.
-I mean, why are you driving
away from him, exactly?

57:18.502 --> 57:21.103
I don't know. It just seemed
like the right thing to do.

57:22.039 --> 57:26.208
I agree. I agree,
it did seem like the right thing
to do at the time...

57:27.077 --> 57:30.712
but now
that it's this space-time,

57:31.081 --> 57:33.949
maybe we should reconsider.

57:50.201 --> 57:51.667
[sighs]

58:07.117 --> 58:08.584
What are you thinking about?

58:09.653 --> 58:10.752
I don't know.

58:12.656 --> 58:14.623
What are you thinking about?

58:14.625 --> 58:17.559
I don't know.
I'm just so confused.

58:17.561 --> 58:19.528
It's okay.
You're a General Studies major.

58:19.530 --> 58:21.830
You guys don't know
anything about everything.

58:21.832 --> 58:24.766
Fuck you, multi whatever!

58:24.768 --> 58:26.768
Get us the fuck out
of this dimension!

58:26.770 --> 58:28.670
No need to be ashamed.

58:28.671 --> 58:30.571
Your brain picked
the major it could handle
at its fullest capacity.

58:30.574 --> 58:32.941
Everyone has their own paths.
Some are farmers, they're happy.

58:32.943 --> 58:35.744
-Holy shit, he's back!
-He's back?

58:35.746 --> 58:39.681
There's just no
getting rid of this guy.
Who the fuck is he?

58:41.252 --> 58:43.619
-Well, let's ask him.
-Sure,

58:43.621 --> 58:45.821
let's get this over with,
for God's sakes.

58:48.192 --> 58:49.525
Hey!

58:52.162 --> 58:54.263
Can we help you?

59:02.139 --> 59:07.643
What do you want from us?

59:15.286 --> 59:16.618
Oh, fuck!

59:17.655 --> 59:19.788
Fine, you can have him.

59:19.790 --> 59:22.224
-Oh, fuck no!
-Oh, yes.

59:22.226 --> 59:25.561
-Oh, no! Hell no!
-What's he gonna do to you?

59:25.563 --> 59:26.995
Rape your brain?

59:26.997 --> 59:30.098
-Probably!
-And is that a bad thing?

59:30.100 --> 59:33.135
It sounds a lot better
than what we're currently
going through here!

59:35.839 --> 59:41.710
What do you want with me?

59:50.621 --> 59:52.154
He wants your head!

59:52.156 --> 59:54.022
-He's not getting my head.
-Why not?

59:54.024 --> 59:55.591
'Cause it's my head, not yours!

59:56.694 --> 59:58.126
Okay, okay. [clears throat]

01:00:00.965 --> 01:00:04.833
What do you need

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:08.036
his head for?

01:00:13.744 --> 01:00:16.144
[rolling down the window]

01:00:20.918 --> 01:00:25.120
[high-pitched voice]
To solve the problem.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.659
He speaks.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.028
See?

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:35.697
See? It wasn't so bad.

01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:40.636
Shit.

01:00:40.638 --> 01:00:41.670
What?

01:00:41.672 --> 01:00:43.105
What, shit?

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:48.744
What's wrong?
You solved it already, right?

01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:50.245
We just need to give it to him.

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:54.783
I can't. [clears throat]

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:58.120
What? Why? Why can't you?

01:00:59.123 --> 01:01:02.658
-It's gone.
-What do you mean, it's gone?

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:07.262
-I threw it away.
-No, I thought you had
some blowjob with the universe.

01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:08.664
Where did it go?

01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:11.266
I... I wrote it.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:12.668
Yeah?

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:15.037
I...

01:01:15.039 --> 01:01:19.074
Oh, no. Oh, no!

01:01:19.977 --> 01:01:21.743
You didn't?

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:23.078
I did.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.448
-You didn't do that.
-Yeah.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:29.885
You wiped your ass with
the answer to the greatest
question in the human history.

01:01:29.887 --> 01:01:32.320
I did do that.

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:36.758
Jesus Christ, man! No wonder
everything's gone to hell

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.960
in a hand basket.
God's fucking pissed.

01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:40.696
I think so. I had no idea!

01:01:40.698 --> 01:01:42.698
-You had no idea?
-I had no idea!

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.200
All you had to do was ask.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:47.836
-Oh, my God, he's got a gun!
-No!

01:01:47.838 --> 01:01:50.806
[tension music]

01:01:51.975 --> 01:01:54.342
-Oh, my God, oh, my God.
-What are you doing?

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:58.013
-You can't escape him.
He's everywhere.
-Oh, God.

01:01:58.015 --> 01:02:00.449
-Oh, God.
-Maybe he's our counselor.

01:02:00.451 --> 01:02:02.718
I mean, he is like God.

01:02:04.288 --> 01:02:08.356
-I really think he's God.
-God doesn't need me
to solve the world's problems.

01:02:08.358 --> 01:02:11.026
He already solved his
by creating this universe
and not being in it.

01:02:11.028 --> 01:02:13.095
He just gets to observe.

01:02:13.097 --> 01:02:15.931
-Whatever, just drive.
-Okay, okay.

01:02:16.734 --> 01:02:19.768
Hey, that actually makes sense.

01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:22.204
Did God abandon me

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:24.773
or did I abandon him?

01:02:25.509 --> 01:02:31.747
Life is some, like, rigged
metaphysical SAT test

01:02:31.749 --> 01:02:33.749
with unfair questions.

01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:35.016
[soft music]

01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:37.486
I failed.

01:02:39.022 --> 01:02:42.190
I mean, I won
the genetic lottery, man.

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:44.893
My parents love me
in their own way.

01:02:46.063 --> 01:02:48.463
I didn't go hungry
or long for anything.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.901
I was actually pretty spoiled,
to tell you the truth.

01:02:55.005 --> 01:02:57.372
They weren't Catholic, but they
sent me to Catholic School

01:02:57.374 --> 01:02:59.307
so I could get a good education.

01:03:00.144 --> 01:03:01.543
And what happened?

01:03:02.379 --> 01:03:08.383
I hated it.
I hated them... and God.

01:03:10.888 --> 01:03:13.455
I mean, I didn't see any proof.
I saw the opposite.

01:03:13.457 --> 01:03:16.224
Dirty men looking up skirts.

01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:22.798
Sex Ed was about how to abstain,
not science.

01:03:24.802 --> 01:03:26.268
Fucking hypocrites!

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:28.870
But...

01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:33.008
if there really is a god...

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:39.181
then his particle, it's, like,

01:03:39.183 --> 01:03:41.149
the bonus question for mankind,

01:03:41.852 --> 01:03:44.386
and your revelation from him...

01:03:45.189 --> 01:03:47.455
is a gift from him.

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:49.958
To flush that shit down
the toilet?

01:03:50.928 --> 01:03:53.128
You might as well have just
flipped God the bird.

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:59.000
It's, like,
Noah and the Arc now.

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:02.170
He's just rebooting mankind.

01:04:02.973 --> 01:04:04.372
Think, Toby, think.

01:04:04.374 --> 01:04:08.877
Yeah, think!
Think. Take your time.

01:04:09.413 --> 01:04:12.314
Take your... wait for it!

01:04:12.316 --> 01:04:15.450
Space-time! [laughs]

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:18.453
-I crack myself up.
-Glad you're so amused.

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:22.224
God works
in mysterious ways, man.

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:25.594
Where is this counselor?

01:04:25.596 --> 01:04:26.895
You'll see yours...

01:04:30.234 --> 01:04:31.433
when you're meant to see yours.

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:34.603
Do you remember how we met?

01:04:35.305 --> 01:04:38.139
I have no idea who you are

01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:39.875
or where you came from.

01:04:40.644 --> 01:04:43.044
The last thing I remember
is Halloween

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:45.580
and doing shots at the Bluewhale

01:04:45.582 --> 01:04:48.550
for their Bottomless
Tuesday Costume Game Night.

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:52.120
So that's not what you
wear all the time?

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:54.956
Is that what you wear
all the time?

01:04:54.958 --> 01:04:56.391
Don't answer that.

01:04:57.661 --> 01:05:00.262
-It's only Saturday.
-That's entirely possible.

01:05:00.264 --> 01:05:04.432
I could've OD'd. For all
you know, I could be an angel.

01:05:04.434 --> 01:05:06.134
Absolutely not.

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:10.171
Or a fantasy
of your OCD imagination.

01:05:10.173 --> 01:05:13.308
Unlikely. I have OCD,
not schizophrenia.

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:15.243
Makes it hard
to have friends, honestly.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:17.112
Hey, let's make a calendar

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:19.114
of everything
that's happened so far.

01:05:19.483 --> 01:05:20.582
Write it out, would you?

01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:28.390
[Toby] <i> Everything in physics</i>

Einstein, and quantum mechanics.

01:05:45.575 --> 01:05:48.176
It meant I could finish
my senior thesis,

01:05:48.178 --> 01:05:50.211
"The Theory of Everything."

01:05:50.213 --> 01:05:53.114

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:07.228

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:26.080
-Skull vodka?
-Yeah,
my dad's a physicist too,

01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:06.287
Well, thank you.

01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:09.057
You're welcome.
It's never happened for me.

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:13.528
-What? You mean you're a...
-You don't have to say it.

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:16.531
Are you trying to tell me
that I took your virginity?

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:19.567
Maybe. I don't remember, anyway.
It doesn't matter.

01:07:19.569 --> 01:07:23.138

<i>I finished, and I wrote it down.</i>

01:07:46.329 --> 01:07:50.265
<i> And ran out of toilet paper</i>

01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:51.800
<i> so, um...</i>

01:07:55.272 --> 01:07:59.841

just this big bang suck...

01:08:01.645 --> 01:08:07.348

we may not be
in the same dimension anymore.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:33.774
Halloween was the end
of the world as we know it.

01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:37.545
Total chaos. Mass hysteria.

Every door, every turn

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.630
Of course.
Check the mini fridge.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.335
Okay, so what you're trying
to tell me is that you

01:09:00.337 --> 01:09:02.670
solving that stupid
equation entangled

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.238
the multiverse?

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:16.850
Ah, salvia! That's why they
delivered all that beer.

01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:20.721
-[Kara] <i> Beer? I like beer.</i>
<i> -They evacuated the planet.</i>

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:24.325
I still don't get
who evacuated the planet.

01:09:24.794 --> 01:09:27.662
Of course. Who else?

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:32.367
I mean, evacuated.
It's a strong word.

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:34.402
Everyone just got uploaded.

01:09:37.807 --> 01:09:40.808
<i> -Uploaded?</i>
<i> -To the cloud.</i>

01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:44.245
The cloud? You mean the sky?

01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:47.282
Yeah, the sky.

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:48.883
By God?

01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:50.385
He's an agent.

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:51.819
I told you he was God.

01:09:51.821 --> 01:09:53.621
He's with AmasNoogle.

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:56.191
Oh, I like AmasNoogle!

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:59.194
<i> I get my shoes on there</i>
<i> and my makeup and my movies</i>

01:09:59.196 --> 01:10:02.764
-and my homework.
-I mean, it's pretty simple.

01:10:02.766 --> 01:10:07.402
So simple. You just click, and
a purse is there the next day.

01:10:07.404 --> 01:10:09.571
It's so fast, so cheap.

01:10:09.573 --> 01:10:10.905
Shit.

01:10:11.975 --> 01:10:13.942
[speaks in a foreign language]

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:18.346
[Toby] <i> AmasNoogle tricked me.</i>
<i> They sent an agent to get</i>

01:10:18.348 --> 01:10:20.348
<i> my equation</i>
<i> because it's the bridge.</i>

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:22.984
The bridge to their global cyber
consciousness.

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:26.521
AI and to protect the world
from total collapse,

01:10:26.523 --> 01:10:30.291
AmasNoogle probably saved
everyone to the cloud big data
style until...

01:10:30.293 --> 01:10:32.827
-Until what?
-Until AmasNoogle can figure out

01:10:32.829 --> 01:10:35.663
what the fuck to do to protect
its revenue, obviously.

01:10:35.665 --> 01:10:37.765
-How do they solve it?
-They can't,

01:10:37.767 --> 01:10:39.801
not without imploding
the bridge in the code,

01:10:39.803 --> 01:10:42.637
which is my equation.
AmasNoogle isn't a person.

01:10:42.639 --> 01:10:46.441
It's just a computer now.
And only life and blood

01:10:46.443 --> 01:10:49.010
can experience
transcendent enlightenment.

01:10:49.012 --> 01:10:53.281
Only we know
what spiritual truth is.

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:58.820
The disconnect is between their
digital consciousness algorithm

01:10:58.822 --> 01:11:00.788
and my organic moment
of enlightenment.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:02.857
[Kara] So what do we have to do?

01:11:02.859 --> 01:11:06.494
What we have to do is undo

01:11:06.496 --> 01:11:07.929
the damage of my flush.

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:09.864
Upload the equation,

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:12.834
fill the gap in information,
and <i> voilà</i> .

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:15.903
-The equation you wiped
your ass with?
-Yeah.

01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:16.871
Awesome.

01:11:18.575 --> 01:11:20.675
Are we still going
to the launch pad?

01:11:20.677 --> 01:11:22.510
[Toby] No, there's nobody there.

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:24.846
It's okay. I just have to think.

01:11:29.519 --> 01:11:32.387
Uh, what you doing?

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:37.325
It just helps me think.

01:11:38.762 --> 01:11:41.496
-That little skateboard?
-Fingerboard.

01:11:41.498 --> 01:11:43.031
They say it's good
for scientists

01:11:43.033 --> 01:11:45.333
and businesspeople
to calm the nerves.

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:47.802
Mkay.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.814
Um... I really hate
to be a bother here

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:02.784
but is that really necessary?

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:05.953
Yeah.

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:08.456
Okay, just checking.

01:12:12.062 --> 01:12:16.531
-He's still following us.
-I think he's waiting for me
to solve the equation again.

01:12:16.533 --> 01:12:18.733
Uh... Do you have a plan?

01:12:19.369 --> 01:12:20.668
Um...

01:12:21.371 --> 01:12:24.439
Okay, 'cause you did say
at one point

01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:25.807
that you had a plan...

01:12:25.809 --> 01:12:27.742
-Yeah,
-...for everything.

01:12:27.744 --> 01:12:30.111
I...I'm formulating.
There's-- there've been a lot

01:12:30.113 --> 01:12:32.747
-of interesting developments.
-Yes, surely.

01:12:32.749 --> 01:12:35.083
I mean,
I don't mean to be tacky,

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:38.920
but we are, you know,
the last people on the planet,

01:12:38.922 --> 01:12:40.355
so there's that!

01:12:42.492 --> 01:12:44.492
Holy shit!

01:12:44.494 --> 01:12:46.894
-Holy shit, what?
-You are a genius!

01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:48.930
-What'd I do?
-I mean, I am after realizing

01:12:48.932 --> 01:12:50.631
the value of what you just said.

01:12:50.633 --> 01:12:53.768
You're a genius? You're special.

01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:56.871
You said
you don't want to be tacky,

01:12:56.873 --> 01:13:00.608
but we're the last people
on the planet, so...

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:05.079
Look,
I am in no way shape or form
having sex with you again.

01:13:05.081 --> 01:13:08.116
Not in this lifetime.
Not in this reality.

01:13:08.118 --> 01:13:12.653
Not in your reality or in his
or in any of those other
fucking mes and yous out there

01:13:12.655 --> 01:13:14.989
thinking
about probabilistic bullshit.

01:13:14.991 --> 01:13:17.392
No, tachyons.
The hypothetical particles

01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:19.727
that travel faster
than the speed of light,

01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:21.562
which nothing
technically can do.

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:24.532
I am once in my life
not thinking about sex.

01:13:24.534 --> 01:13:28.102
It might have happened
in the past,
but it's not happening again.

01:13:28.104 --> 01:13:30.705
-Mm, yes, it is.
-No, it's not.

01:13:30.707 --> 01:13:33.741
I mean it really is if I can
get us to that dimension.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:36.411
-No, it's not.
-You're not getting it.

01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:39.580
-We have to go back.
-What?

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:41.916
We have to go back.

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:43.117
Go back where?

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:46.087
Go back-- go back in...

01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:48.723
-In what?
-Space-time!

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:54.095
[laughing]

01:13:56.866 --> 01:14:00.935
And how, pray tell,
do you expect us to do that?

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:04.739
Simple. Tachyons exist
in a dimension on the other side
of the speed of light

01:14:04.741 --> 01:14:07.975
at such a high energy level
that they can travel backwards

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:11.479
through time.
So, hypothetically,

01:14:11.481 --> 01:14:14.182
we just need enough energy
to step through a wormhole

01:14:14.184 --> 01:14:17.785
without being ripped apart
by gravitational forces.

01:14:26.596 --> 01:14:28.529
Gah, for God's sakes!

01:14:28.531 --> 01:14:31.032
Are you trying to tell me
Suunnee's a time machine?

01:14:31.034 --> 01:14:34.101
-Not a time machine.
-Not a time machine?

01:14:34.103 --> 01:14:37.104
Not a time machine
but a space-time sling.

01:14:39.542 --> 01:14:42.543
Yes, exactly,
'cause I was really hoping

01:14:42.545 --> 01:14:44.979
you weren't taking me back
to the past in a DeLorean.

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:48.616
I'd rather a souped-up
muscle car that currently

01:14:48.618 --> 01:14:50.885
has a mini fridge
jammed up at my vajayjay,

01:14:50.887 --> 01:14:53.621
a sex floaty, and a surfboard...
on the roof!

01:14:53.623 --> 01:14:55.623
You know,
I'm trying to solve this here...

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:57.959
and you're being antagonistic.

01:14:57.961 --> 01:15:00.528
Can you grab us a few drinks out
of the fridge, please?

01:15:02.565 --> 01:15:05.633
No, no, no, not those. Those.

01:15:05.635 --> 01:15:07.268
I made those myself.

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:09.537
I'm just trying
to live in reality.

01:15:09.539 --> 01:15:12.573
-Ah, there's your problem.
-I give up. Bring the agent

01:15:12.575 --> 01:15:14.709
back, please.
Can I go ride with him?

01:15:14.711 --> 01:15:16.844
-Technically, no.
-Why not?

01:15:17.814 --> 01:15:20.047
Because he's straddling
the organic in digital system.

01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:22.650
If he wants it to be solved,
he's gonna have me do it

01:15:22.652 --> 01:15:25.686
in my organic space.
In my loaf of bread.

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:29.924
You see now that
these dimensions overlap.

01:15:29.926 --> 01:15:32.994
Only we are still in line
within my super symmetry dump,

01:15:32.996 --> 01:15:35.930
and if he does anything
to us now,

01:15:35.932 --> 01:15:40.635
he may alter
the potential to undo
what's been done then there.

01:15:41.571 --> 01:15:43.237
Is that a turtle?

01:15:43.239 --> 01:15:47.208
This is Tank,
my California desert tortoise.

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:50.077
He's currently 85 years old.

01:15:50.914 --> 01:15:54.215
He's been hibernating, so
he's gonna be a little groggy.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:57.151
No food, no water for months.

01:15:59.756 --> 01:16:02.223
He hasn't gone to the bathroom
since first semester.

01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:05.793
I rescued him
when they developed
the desert with wind turbines.

01:16:06.696 --> 01:16:09.297
See, with everything,
there's a plus and a minus.

01:16:09.299 --> 01:16:12.833
There's no living organism
more adept at storing energy,

01:16:13.236 --> 01:16:16.037
and we're gonna need
a lot of it.

01:16:16.039 --> 01:16:19.574
Physics, my dear friend,
is about interlocking forces.

01:16:19.576 --> 01:16:21.876
Dark energy has dark matter.

01:16:21.878 --> 01:16:24.912
Suunnee has Tank.

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:27.949
We can use opposing forces.
Nature and machine

01:16:27.951 --> 01:16:31.085
to slingshot us
through space-time.

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:33.955
-You're feeling better.
-Yes.

01:16:33.957 --> 01:16:36.591
Me too. This makes sense.

01:16:36.593 --> 01:16:38.092
So what's next?

01:16:38.795 --> 01:16:40.127
Hello, Tank.

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:41.963
-We go back.
-Yes.

01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:45.833
Let's-- wait,
I'm so sorry. I missed that.

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:48.636
-How do we do that again?
-Like this.

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:01.949
[epic music]

01:17:14.931 --> 01:17:15.896
[Kara] Aah.

01:17:19.369 --> 01:17:23.304
Whoa! Dude,
you're freaking me out.

01:17:24.941 --> 01:17:28.342
Oh, dude, don't do this.
Don't freak me out anymore.

01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:30.111
I swear, I'll go back to church.

01:17:30.113 --> 01:17:32.213
No, no, it's okay.

01:17:32.215 --> 01:17:34.749
Just close your eyes too
and drink your beer.

01:17:34.751 --> 01:17:38.252
We have to do it together
to achieve our super symmetry.

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:41.255
No, you're fucking nuts, man!

01:17:41.257 --> 01:17:43.691
I'm not gonna close
my goddamn eyes

01:17:43.693 --> 01:17:46.227
while we're driving 60 miles
an hour down the highway

01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:48.829
with a turtle
on the dashboard in reverse!

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:50.231
Tank is a tortoise.

01:17:50.933 --> 01:17:52.266
Huge difference.

01:17:52.268 --> 01:17:53.701
Turtle, tortoise.

01:17:53.703 --> 01:17:55.169
I'm not doing it.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:57.138
Fine, stay here.
Break the universe.

01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.407
-No big deal.
-Oh, don't! Don't you dare

01:17:59.409 --> 01:18:02.009
mind fuck my Catholic guilt!

01:18:02.812 --> 01:18:07.281
No, actually, we need you
to just clear your mind

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:12.453
and channel my moment
of enlightenment and let go.

01:18:13.723 --> 01:18:15.456

Oh... shit!

01:19:29.298 --> 01:19:31.165
Just keep them closed!

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:33.200
No matter what happens!

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:35.836
Keep them closed.

01:19:36.873 --> 01:19:38.439
[Kara] Oh, fuck.

01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:40.407
[Toby] Closed.

01:19:44.814 --> 01:19:49.950

[Kara] <i> I thought you'd be gone.</i>

01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:36.530
