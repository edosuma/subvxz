20:32.439 --> 20:34.566
Yeah, Sam. That's it.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.776
In through the nose.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.528
- (inhales)
- Out through the mouth.

20:38.528 --> 20:42.324
(hissing)

20:42.324 --> 20:44.576
Yes. That's good, Sam. Okay.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.287
Just you and your breath. Deep.

20:48.705 --> 20:51.124
(inhales)

20:51.124 --> 20:54.378
- Yeah.
- (hissing)

21:00.509 --> 21:02.886
- (whispers): That's good.
- (stops hissing)

21:02.886 --> 21:06.014

21:06.014 --> 21:09.226

21:12.354 --> 21:13.689
You got it now.

21:13.689 --> 21:17.067
- (stops hissing)
- (giggles) Do you
feel the difference?

21:17.067 --> 21:19.695
- Yeah.
- Now, remember that feeling.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.488
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yeah. (giggles)

21:21.488 --> 21:23.782
Like the first time
you fell in love.

21:26.660 --> 21:27.744
Okay.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.332
- Oh. Do you need a minute?
- Sure.

21:32.332 --> 21:36.211
(deep sigh, sniffles)

21:37.045 --> 21:38.839
(sighs)

21:38.839 --> 21:41.550
- Okay, let's do it again.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.552
- Okay.
- You have this.

21:44.511 --> 21:45.721
Nice deep one.

21:45.721 --> 21:48.265
- Push this hand out.
- (inhales)

21:48.265 --> 21:50.809
(sighs) I can't do it.

21:53.061 --> 21:56.106
- I just can't do it.
I'm sorry.
- It's okay, Sam.

21:56.106 --> 21:59.609

I think I wanna go.
I just wanna go.

Let's go for a walk.

23:02.547 --> 23:05.801
I don't feel like getting
steps right now, Joel.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.804
It's not a steps walk.
It's a nature walk.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.472
We'll see
something beautiful.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.474

23:12.474 --> 23:14.559
I just wanna
stare at the wall.

23:17.312 --> 23:20.941
we can go get some
Cweamy Dweamy.

I don't understand
what happened.

I mean, she just...

24:11.741 --> 24:13.743
(sighs)

24:13.743 --> 24:15.036
We were just working
on my breathing,

24:15.036 --> 24:16.872
which is what
we did every time...

24:18.290 --> 24:20.208
But this time, she...

24:22.127 --> 24:25.005
said, "I'm gonna
put my hand here."

24:25.005 --> 24:27.215
And she put one here, and...

24:29.092 --> 24:32.179
she just told me to breathe
slow and deeper

24:32.179 --> 24:34.181
and deeper and...

24:35.515 --> 24:37.642
She was just...

24:37.642 --> 24:40.604
She was just so fucking,
like, patient or something.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.356
And so, I kept going,
and then she said,

24:43.356 --> 24:46.318
"Remember this feeling," and--
Fuck! Here I go again.

24:47.068 --> 24:48.153
(sighs)

24:49.446 --> 24:50.864
She said,
"Remember this feeling.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.431
Now, why would I do that
to myself? (laughs)

25:18.600 --> 25:22.312
- Well, do you
wanna change that?
- (scoffs) No.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.522
I'd rather just sit around
judging people

25:24.522 --> 25:28.443
that choose love and lose.
(laughs, sniffles)

25:28.443 --> 25:31.238
- Maybe we could join
a dating site together.
- Oh, absolutely not.

25:31.238 --> 25:34.074
