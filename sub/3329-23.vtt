WEBVTT

00:05.800 --> 00:08.439
GREGSON: Can you read that
all right, Hugo?

00:08.470 --> 00:10.335
You need glasses?

00:10.370 --> 00:12.076
It's an ad, I guess.

00:12.110 --> 00:14.078
Like, an online classified ad.

00:14.110 --> 00:16.101
You don't need to guess--
you placed it.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.243
IP address says it came
from the library

00:18.280 --> 00:19.611
down the block
from your apartment.

00:19.650 --> 00:21.777
"Wanted:
free spirits with dance moves.

00:21.820 --> 00:23.515
Make a memory and 50 bucks."

00:23.550 --> 00:25.586
You sent Raggedy Andy masks
like this one

00:25.620 --> 00:27.508
to everyone who responded.

00:27.560 --> 00:29.824
They thought they were gonna be
in a flash mob viral video.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.452
When in faot
they were partICIpants

00:31.490 --> 00:32.696
in a human shell game.

00:32.730 --> 00:34.425
Your unwitting accomplices
provided cover,

00:34.460 --> 00:36.064
while you stabbed your boss

00:36.100 --> 00:37.226
in broad daylight.

00:37.270 --> 00:38.294
You then fled

00:38.330 --> 00:40.389
amongst the dispersing Andys.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.567
Nobody here thinks much
of your scheme,

00:42.610 --> 00:46.137
but your masks,
they're impressive.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.205
How long did it take you
to make 'em, Hugo?

00:48.240 --> 00:49.776
(scoffs):
You think I can sew?

00:49.810 --> 00:51.300
Well enough
that it gave you away.

00:51.350 --> 00:53.477
HOLMES: Half the masks
we recovered bore these

00:53.520 --> 00:55.818
irregular stitches, here--
but only half.

00:55.850 --> 00:58.284
These defects bothered
you enough to seek out
a replacement bobbin

00:58.320 --> 00:59.480
for your antique machine.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.249
You bought two
at the Stitch-rite

01:01.290 --> 01:02.723
down in the Garment District.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.182
It's on tape.
Go ahead, then,

01:04.230 --> 01:05.754
lock me up--
I got some bobbins.

01:05.790 --> 01:07.792
And...

01:08.830 --> 01:11.560
...a KA-BAR military knife.

01:12.870 --> 01:14.497
We recovered that
from the furnace

01:14.540 --> 01:15.768
at your mother's house.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.768
The leather handle
and the blood evidence

01:17.810 --> 01:19.698
have burned away,
but the serrated edge

01:19.740 --> 01:22.800
may as well as signed your name
on your victim's ribs.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.579
GREGSON: You want to give us
your confession,

01:24.610 --> 01:27.579
help us help you,
now would be a good time.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.557
Pat.

01:34.590 --> 01:35.682
(chuckles):
Hey.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.221
No one told me
you were here.

01:37.260 --> 01:39.319
Heard you were in the box,
so I said

01:39.360 --> 01:41.225
I'd make myself
at home.
Yeah.

01:41.260 --> 01:42.761
Close the door, would you?

01:42.800 --> 01:44.893
What brings you down?

01:44.930 --> 01:46.659
Nothing bad.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.861
Is it something good?

01:48.900 --> 01:50.731
'Cause, uh...

01:50.770 --> 01:53.568
that's some top-shelf scotch.
I may not look

01:53.610 --> 01:55.703
like a fairy godmother, Tommy,

01:55.740 --> 01:58.208
but... looks can be deceiving.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.817
You and I are gonna have a chat

02:02.850 --> 02:04.841
about the future of this unit.

02:06.690 --> 02:09.454
(bees buzzing, sprayer hissing)

02:29.950 --> 02:33.670
I heard you found 12 mites
per hundred up at Hyde Park.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.211
Most of their hives
won't make it.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.810
I've been doing fieldwork
for the USDA for 15 years--

02:38.850 --> 02:40.454
I've never seen Colony Collapse
numbers this bad.

02:40.490 --> 02:42.651
I've got friends
in California

02:42.690 --> 02:44.783
say they're
gonna lose 20%, 25%.

02:44.830 --> 02:46.855
The winter was so cold
that folks up here

02:46.900 --> 02:47.798
are gonna lose twice that.

02:47.830 --> 02:48.819
Yeah.

02:48.860 --> 02:50.862
What do you think it is?

02:50.900 --> 02:52.788
Pesticides? Mites? What?

02:52.840 --> 02:54.398
You know, I don't know.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.431
But we're gonna get
to the bottom of it.

03:13.590 --> 03:15.182
Everett!

03:18.890 --> 03:22.963
What the hell have you done
to my bees!

03:26.870 --> 03:29.236
Oh, my God!

03:32.440 --> 03:34.305
(gasps):
Oh...!

03:43.450 --> 03:45.645
MAN_:
No, srr.

03:45.690 --> 03:47.555
Uh, understood.

03:47.590 --> 03:49.558
I will, sir.

03:49.590 --> 03:52.923
If you guys work for the USDA,
why didn't you just say so?

03:52.960 --> 03:55.451
WATSON: We don't.
My partner's on a
beekeeping message board

03:55.500 --> 03:56.728
with a few of
their researchers.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.692
They asked us
to come and have a look,

03:58.730 --> 04:00.334
since it's one
of their colleagues that died.

04:00.370 --> 04:01.997
Guess I should apologize
for the misunderstanding.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.007
Oh, that's quite
all right, Officer.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.837
It was very rude of me

04:04.870 --> 04:06.872
to save your life
in such a brusque fashion.

04:06.910 --> 04:08.537
I'm not sure_
you saved my life.

04:08.580 --> 04:11.640
Yanked evidence out of
my hand is more like it.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.614
If he hadn't, you'd be
suffering arrhythmia by now.

04:13.650 --> 04:15.675
If you kept smelling that egg
carton, it would've killed you.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.914
Now, you said
you could tell that thing

04:16.950 --> 04:19.510
was soaked in cyanide
by the scent?

04:19.560 --> 04:20.709
From ten feet away.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.352
Okay. So...

04:22.390 --> 04:24.426
somebody dropped that
in the guy's smoker,

04:24.460 --> 04:26.826
and then he goes off
to comb the swarm,

04:26.860 --> 04:31.069
and poof-- he's gassing
the bees and breathing poison.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.591
An eloquent summation. You might
want to tell your colleague

04:33.640 --> 04:35.596
that the apiarist
is not a strong suspect.

04:35.640 --> 04:36.902
The hell she isn't.

04:36.940 --> 04:38.407
She was the only other person

04:38.440 --> 04:39.600
out here when
this thing happened.

04:39.640 --> 04:40.709
And as far as Watson and I

04:40.740 --> 04:41.832
have been able to discern,
utterly devoid

04:41.880 --> 04:43.302
of any motive--

04:43.350 --> 04:44.772
unlike the soulless
corporate golem

04:44.810 --> 04:46.619
that is AgriNext.

04:46.650 --> 04:49.312
You think a company did this?

04:49.350 --> 04:50.886
It wouldn't be the first time
they'd harbored a killer.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.912
He's right-- we found one there
a few months ago.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.689
So what makes you think
they did this?

04:55.720 --> 04:57.688
Elevated levels
of Colony Collapse Disorder

04:57.730 --> 04:59.027
along the Northeast.

04:59.060 --> 05:00.721
You putting that
on AgriNext, too?

05:00.760 --> 05:02.569
Everett Keck did.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.397
His notes strongly suggest
that the company's

05:04.430 --> 05:07.092
neonicotinoid pesticides
are the cause.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.462
So this guy was killed
over some dead bees?

05:10.510 --> 05:12.034
A hundred million dead bees.
(phone chimes)

05:12.070 --> 05:13.674
The regional numbers
are so anomalous

05:13.710 --> 05:15.405
that an international
apIary summit

05:15.440 --> 05:17.044
has been convened
at Garrison UniverSIty

05:17.080 --> 05:18.877
to discuss the problem
this week.

05:18.910 --> 05:20.719
Everett Keck's notes
suggest he was Willing

05:20.750 --> 05:22.809
to cut short that debate
and lay the blame squarely

05:22.850 --> 05:23.942
at the feet of AgriNext.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.582
MAN: Officer,
need a hand here!

05:25.620 --> 05:27.679
WATSON:
So, are you good here?

05:27.720 --> 05:29.722
HOLMES:
I'm done here, actually.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.057
Why?

05:32.090 --> 05:33.899
The captain wants to see me
at the station.

05:33.930 --> 05:35.727
He says he needs my help
with something.

05:37.470 --> 05:39.392
(knocking)
"Come by the office.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.737
No Sherlock."

05:40.770 --> 05:41.668
Come in, come in.

05:41.700 --> 05:42.701
Close the door.

05:46.070 --> 05:47.503
I'm sorry for the
cloak-and-dagger-- it's just,

05:47.540 --> 05:48.905
this is a little delicate.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.749
Is everything okay?

05:50.780 --> 05:53.044
I've been offered a promotion.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.879
Wow.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.512
Downtown likes
the work we've been doing,

05:57.550 --> 05:59.780
and they want to bump me up
to deputy chief.

06:01.460 --> 06:03.985
That's incredible!
Do I give you a hug?

06:04.030 --> 06:04.985
(laughs):
No, no, no, no, no.

06:05.030 --> 06:06.725
You can, you can sit.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.421
This is not a done deal.

06:08.460 --> 06:09.427
Well, but you're
gonna say yes.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.426
Why wouldn't you?

06:11.470 --> 06:13.131
If I'm not leaving
my people in good hands,

06:13.170 --> 06:15.661
I'm not leaving my people
at all.

06:15.700 --> 06:18.601
Now, the name they've floated
to replace me is Ann Vescey.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.973
She's a CD. of the five-one
squad, up in the Bronx.

06:22.010 --> 06:22.977
Do you know her?

06:23.010 --> 06:24.671
I know of her.

06:24.710 --> 06:26.849
She's, uh, got some heat.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.814
All the right people are fans.

06:28.850 --> 06:31.614
But I'm worried
about her home base.

06:31.650 --> 06:33.811
The five-one had
a property room scandal

06:33.860 --> 06:36.010
a couple of years back,
and although

06:36.060 --> 06:38.085
she wasn't implicated...

06:38.130 --> 06:40.018
You want me to check her out.

06:40.060 --> 06:41.994
Yeah.

06:42.030 --> 06:45.761
A few of her guys there
had a habit of skimming
from a big coke bust

06:45.800 --> 06:47.688
that they had
in property lockup.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.038
They were careful,
took a little at a time--

06:50.070 --> 06:54.700
long story short is, IAB wasn't
sure that they got everyone.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.605
Now, Major Crimes

06:56.650 --> 06:58.470
has the biggest
discretionary budget

06:58.510 --> 07:00.011
short of Counterterrorism.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.608
I got to know
for sure that

07:01.650 --> 07:02.947
I'm not handing over the keys

07:02.990 --> 07:04.082
to someone with sticlq fingers.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.781
I get it.

07:05.820 --> 07:08.948
I would've asked you
to bring Holmes, but...

07:08.990 --> 07:10.548
It's delicate.

07:10.590 --> 07:12.080
I'm happy to help.

07:13.630 --> 07:15.097
MAN:
You told me on the phone

07:15.130 --> 07:16.768
this was about
the Barbara Conway case.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.563
It seemed unlikely
you'd be willing

07:18.600 --> 07:21.489
to talk about the real reason
for my visit, so I lied.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.633
I'm sure you'll return
the favor soon enough.

07:23.670 --> 07:25.467
(chuckles)

07:25.510 --> 07:26.909
I don't understand the
hostility, Mr. Holmes.

07:26.940 --> 07:29.033
You... you solved
the murder of our CFO

07:29.080 --> 07:30.741
and one of our
board members,

07:30.780 --> 07:32.873
and you still don't think
we'd meet with you?

07:32.920 --> 07:35.047
Because this place is
a malevolent hellmouth,

07:35.080 --> 07:36.980
and all who pass
through it

07:37.020 --> 07:39.580
are complicit in an ongoing
ecological onslaught.

07:39.620 --> 07:41.759
Or does AgriNext still deny

07:41.790 --> 07:43.951
that its pesticides are causing
Colony Collapse Disorder?

07:43.990 --> 07:46.151
Of course it does.
There's never been
a credible link...

07:46.190 --> 07:47.748
So, the company
would have had

07:47.800 --> 07:49.620
motive to do away
with someone

07:49.670 --> 07:51.490
who was trying
to find the link.

07:51.530 --> 07:53.839
Everett Keck, for example.

07:56.670 --> 08:00.106
I doubt that anyone in this room
committed the actual crime,

08:00.140 --> 08:03.974
but in a pit such as AgriNext,
it takes time to determine

08:04.010 --> 08:06.774
where one snake ends
and the next begins,

08:06.820 --> 08:08.811
so I'm going to give
your executives

08:08.850 --> 08:12.149
as much warning as possible:
come forward with information,

08:12.190 --> 08:13.782
you may be spared.

08:16.860 --> 08:18.657
You're right...

08:18.690 --> 08:21.750
about the company having
an awareness of Mr. Keck.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.769
Naturally, we knew about the
work he was doing for the ASI.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.791
We knew about his report.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.604
But trust me, nobody here
needed to hurt him.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.005
We were well prepared

08:31.040 --> 08:33.076
to counter any claims
he might make.

08:33.110 --> 08:34.907
Explain.

08:34.940 --> 08:38.171
We invested in some
oppOSItlonal research.

08:38.210 --> 08:41.646
As it turned out, Mr. Keck...

08:41.680 --> 08:43.682
was academically under-qualified

08:43.720 --> 08:45.585
for his position.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.087
(wry laugh):
He was a Buddhist
seminary dropout.

08:47.120 --> 08:50.226
Also an abuser of
recreational drugs.

08:50.260 --> 08:52.285
He also had
problems at work.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.888
He made enemies.

08:53.930 --> 08:56.763
At one point, the USDA
even had to suspend him.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.189
So I could probably
provide you with the names

08:59.230 --> 09:01.562
of a few good suspects...

09:01.600 --> 09:05.263
but I'm afraid you haven't
put me in a very generous mood.

09:05.310 --> 09:08.029
So I think I'd rather
you just left.

09:13.350 --> 09:15.568
(sighs)

09:15.620 --> 09:17.212
Hi.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.582
Is the captain leaving us?

09:19.620 --> 09:21.713
Do you have his office bugged
or something?

09:21.760 --> 09:23.125
So you don't deny it.
How could you...

09:23.160 --> 09:25.321
Timing and context.
The spring

09:25.360 --> 09:27.794
before an election is
the NYPD's_ traditional
housecleanlng season.

09:27.830 --> 09:30.822
And it was only a matter of
time before our clearance rate

09:30.870 --> 09:32.292
conferred glory
upon the captain.

09:32.330 --> 09:34.696
Not that he isn't
deserving of it himself,

09:34.740 --> 09:36.708
of course.

09:36.740 --> 09:38.731
You saw the personnel file.

09:38.770 --> 09:40.738
Lieutenant Vescey's name

09:40.780 --> 09:43.305
is familiar to me, as are most
names within the department.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.875
It's not a great leap to
imagine that the captain

09:45.910 --> 09:47.377
would_want to vet his
potential replacement.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.342
Do you know much about her?
I know she's

09:49.380 --> 09:51.189
considered by many
to be a rising star,

09:51.220 --> 09:53.711
but as for the woman herself,
I've not had the pleasure.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.387
She came up
with a few bad apples--

09:55.420 --> 09:57.320
I'm supposed to find out
if they rubbed off.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.918
Mm.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.861
That's it?
What's it?

10:02.900 --> 10:05.619
I tell you the captain
might be leaving, and nothing?

10:05.670 --> 10:08.332
Well, did you imagine he
would remain a captain forever?

10:08.370 --> 10:10.406
Do you think Marcus will
always be a detective?

10:10.440 --> 10:11.338
You and I exist

10:11.370 --> 10:13.634
outside of the bureaucracy
of the department,

10:13.680 --> 10:15.033
and that is by design.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.900
Our colleagues
are as vulnerable to promotions

10:16.950 --> 10:19.009
as they are to demotions,

10:19.050 --> 10:20.779
and we can do little

10:20.820 --> 10:23.744
but honor the former
and mourn the latter.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.111
And what if Captain Vescey
doesn't think she needs

10:26.150 --> 10:27.913
a couple of consultants
hanging around?

10:27.960 --> 10:30.087
Then she will_ reveal herself
an idiot.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.358
And you and I

10:31.390 --> 10:33.028
shall find a new perch--

10:33.060 --> 10:35.824
presumably with the help
of a newly promoted friend.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.897
(sighs):
Oh...

10:38.930 --> 10:41.137
Looks like you opened up
a satellite office

10:41.170 --> 10:43.309
for the Department
of Agriculture in here.

10:43.340 --> 10:46.036
25,000 species of bee--
always much to learn.

10:46.070 --> 10:48.436
Well, if you're planning on
picking up where Keck left off,

10:48.480 --> 10:50.448
it might be nice
to solve his murder first.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.948
That I believe
I may have already done.

10:52.980 --> 10:55.744
I was gone for two hours.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.385
Our friends at AgriNext planned

10:58.420 --> 11:00.684
to run a smear campaign
against Everett Keck.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.950
They claimed
he had a drug problem,

11:02.990 --> 11:04.753
and he'd been suspended
from work.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.018
Keck's tox screen confirmed

11:06.060 --> 11:08.927
_he was indeed
a habitual marijuana user,

11:08.960 --> 11:11.463
and that he died
with Viagra in his system.

11:11.500 --> 11:15.038
I enquired of the USDA
as to his work troubles.

11:15.070 --> 11:18.062
Everett Keck _received
a week's paid leave

11:18.110 --> 11:20.806
whilst enquiries were made
to accusations levied

11:20.840 --> 11:23.900
by a Poughkeepsie beekeeper
named Darryl Jarvis.

11:23.950 --> 11:27.249
This guy thinks
that Keck killed his bees.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.248
By introducing deadly
varroa mites into his hives.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.816
During the course
of the investigation,

11:30.850 --> 11:32.386
it became clear, though,

11:32.420 --> 11:34.149
that Darryl Jarvis was
a paranoid schizophrenic.

11:34.190 --> 11:37.956
Some speculated that his claims
were just results of delusions.

11:37.990 --> 11:40.720
So that probably made Jarvis
even angrier.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.921
That wasn't enough, have a look
at Mr. Jarvis's address.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.427
Everett Keck exa_mined hives
at an apiary

11:45.470 --> 11:47.438
across the street
the day before he died.

11:47.470 --> 11:49.358
So Jarvis would have had
ample opportunity

11:49.400 --> 11:51.038
to tamper with the smoker.

11:51.070 --> 11:53.777
Seems like a man
worth talking to.

11:57.950 --> 12:00.748
It's never wise to wait for
rubbish collection, Mr. Jarvis.

12:00.780 --> 12:03.010
It's always better
to burn the evidence.

12:03.050 --> 12:05.086
What do you mean?

12:05.120 --> 12:07.987
The ground apple seeds you used
in preparation of your cyanide,

12:08.020 --> 12:10.955
the other half of the egg carton
you soaked in it.

12:10.990 --> 12:12.184
WATSON:
You stuffed the other half

12:12.230 --> 12:13.822
in Keck's smoker yesterday

12:13.860 --> 12:15.293
when he was working
across the road.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.001
I couldn't sleep.

12:23.040 --> 12:26.009
That's why I answered
the door so fast.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.105
I was lying in bed,

12:30.150 --> 12:33.449
thinking about
turning myself in.

12:33.480 --> 12:37.883
The minute I heard it worked,
I wished I hadn't done it.

12:37.920 --> 12:40.218
Even after what he did
to my hives.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.224
Even after
no one believed me.

12:47.060 --> 12:49.290
You think I'm crazy,
too, don't you?

12:49.330 --> 12:51.890
We're aware of your condition.

12:51.930 --> 12:54.160
I'm a schizophrenic.

12:56.040 --> 13:00.170
That means I'm in good shape
for an insanity defense, right?

13:02.080 --> 13:04.776
I haven't
gone off my meds in years.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.272
When I put that carton
in Keck's smoker,

13:09.320 --> 13:11.447
I was in my right mind,

13:11.490 --> 13:13.958
just like I was

13:13.990 --> 13:17.380
when _I saw him _
put those mites in my hives.

13:17.430 --> 13:20.024
Just like I am now.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.255
(handcuffs rattling, clicking)

13:22.300 --> 13:24.962
Feel free to put all that
in your report.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.092
Why would he have done it?

13:26.130 --> 13:28.291
Keck?

13:28.340 --> 13:30.865
Why would he have wanted
to harm your hives?

13:30.910 --> 13:34.869
I don't have any idea.

13:34.910 --> 13:37.105
I just know what I saw.

13:49.990 --> 13:52.356
No, I'm a consultant
with the NYPD.

13:52.390 --> 13:56.326
But a warrant could be arranged
pursuant to my request.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.363
Or, if you prefer,
a formal summons could be issued

13:59.400 --> 14:01.960
in response
to this needless obstruction.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.262
(bees buzzing)

14:03.310 --> 14:05.301
(buzzing)

14:06.570 --> 14:10.176
No, don't me on hol...

14:10.210 --> 14:12.144
WATSON:
Oh.

14:12.180 --> 14:14.011
That didn't used to be here.

14:14.050 --> 14:15.972
I'm on hold.

14:16.020 --> 14:17.089
Oh, what's with the files?

14:17.120 --> 14:18.519
We closed Keck last night.

14:18.550 --> 14:20.108
I didn't dream that, did I?

14:20.160 --> 14:22.378
I think Darryl Jarvis was right.

14:22.420 --> 14:25.253
Everett Keck did kill his hives.

14:25.290 --> 14:29.397
I thought the USDA investigated,
and they didn't find anything.

14:29.430 --> 14:31.193
They didn't, but they may have

14:31.230 --> 14:33.369
if bee stings didn't bear
some resemblance

14:33.400 --> 14:35.061
to hypodermic marks.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.204
What are you talking about?

14:37.240 --> 14:39.538
I rendered the latter
With a pin.

14:39.570 --> 14:42.038
Can you tell the difference
from the bee stings?

14:42.080 --> 14:45.447
You're getting stung
by bees on purpose?

14:45.480 --> 14:48.938
Obviously.
I don't have enough
caffeine in my system

14:48.980 --> 14:50.948
to understand you
right now.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.311
The Department of Agriculture
never officially closed

14:53.360 --> 14:55.089
its investigation
into Everett Keck.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.020
It simply withered on the vine

14:57.060 --> 14:59.324
when the supervisor in charge,
Calvin Barnes,

14:59.360 --> 15:01.157
suffered a heart attack,

15:01.200 --> 15:03.293
and subsequent
anoxic brain injury.

15:03.330 --> 15:05.059
He took early retirement.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.294
The matter was dropped.

15:06.330 --> 15:07.991
Okay.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.133
Calvin Barnes
ran two marathons last year.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.536
His cardiovascular health
was excellent.

15:12.570 --> 15:15.368
But it was reported, he
sustained several bee stings

15:15.410 --> 15:17.549
in the field on
the day he collapsed.

15:17.580 --> 15:19.172
Some people thought

15:19.210 --> 15:21.212
that he suffered _
a delayed allergic reaction.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.138
I, myself, do not.

15:23.190 --> 15:25.112
I've been negotiating
with the hospital

15:25.150 --> 15:27.311
that treated Mr. Barnes
to release his records.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.555
When they do,
I suspect his blood work

15:29.590 --> 15:32.479
will show elevated levels
of pota55ium and chlorine.

15:32.530 --> 15:35.249
Hold on. You're saying
that someone poisoned him?

15:35.300 --> 15:37.222
To bring on the heart attack.
Precisely.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.239
But the injection mark was lost
amongst the bee stings.

15:40.270 --> 15:44.502
So you think that Keck
tried to kill his boss

15:44.540 --> 15:46.599
to cover up poisoning
a few bee hives?

15:46.640 --> 15:47.675
More than a few.

15:47.710 --> 15:49.109
I've come to believe

15:49.140 --> 15:50.402
that Ev_erett Keck
was not just studying

15:50.450 --> 15:52.247
Colony Collapse Disorder.

15:52.280 --> 15:56.239
Everett Keck was Colony
Collapse Disorder incarnate.

16:02.220 --> 16:05.087
You might recall
my recent concern

16:05.130 --> 16:07.325
_ over varroas
in my own hives.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.499
These fears were born
out of rumblings on

16:09.530 --> 16:11.066
BeeCircuit.com.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.465
Most of the talk

16:12.500 --> 16:14.639
on the spike of this season's
colony death rate

16:14.670 --> 16:17.161
centered around the spread
of deadly mites.

16:17.210 --> 16:20.270
Okay, but I thought Keck was
gonna prove it was pesticides.

16:20.310 --> 16:22.175
That's what his note suggested.

16:22.210 --> 16:24.371
That's what he intended
to report, but

16:24.410 --> 16:27.208
but the data suggests that
the parasites were appearing

16:27.250 --> 16:29.218
in greater than expected numbers
everywhere he went.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.152
You did all this
overnight?

16:33.190 --> 16:34.612
You know I outsource arithmetic
to Harlan.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.480
Okay, so, that's Keck.

16:36.520 --> 16:39.387
And there are three other
ASI researchers.

16:39.430 --> 16:41.193
He found more mites
than the others.

16:41.230 --> 16:43.164
Many more.
According to Harlan,

16:43.200 --> 16:45.259
the variance between Keck
and his colleagues

16:45.300 --> 16:47.131
cannot be explained away
by known confounds.

16:47.170 --> 16:49.798
The odds
that Mr. Keck was not actively

16:49.840 --> 16:51.535
spreading varroa mites
everywhere he went

16:51.570 --> 16:53.333
approaches one in 29,000.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.109
So, there isn't a spike

16:55.140 --> 16:57.040
in Colony Collapse
Disorder after all.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.809
Every dead hive is a tragedy.

16:58.850 --> 17:02.411
But outside of one nefarious
USDA field researcher,

17:02.450 --> 17:06.238
no, the CCD baseline
would not be inflated at all.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.417
Why would he do
something like this?
I don't know.

17:08.460 --> 17:11.088
I'm fairly certain, however,
he had help.

17:11.130 --> 17:13.121
The heart attack
that almost killed Calvin Barnes

17:13.160 --> 17:16.220
occurred whilst Mr. Keck was
d0ing his rounds in Connecticut.

17:16.260 --> 17:17.329
He had a partner.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.099
We've solved one murder.

17:19.130 --> 17:21.166
Now we just have
the remaining 100 million.

17:31.350 --> 17:36.219
I wish Cal was here
to help explain this.

17:36.250 --> 17:39.287
I-I mean, really here.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.185
In short, Mrs. Barnes,
we think that your husband

17:41.220 --> 17:42.653
was on the verge
of uncovering a plot

17:42.690 --> 17:44.555
to kill off the Northeast's
bee population.

17:44.590 --> 17:46.558
WATSON: Did he ever
talk to you about someone

17:46.590 --> 17:48.194
named Everett Keck?

17:48.230 --> 17:50.562
Sure, he was looking
into Everett

17:50.600 --> 17:53.398
around the time
of his heart attack.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.590
We think that might have been
more than just a coincidence.

17:55.640 --> 17:57.505
I don't understand.

17:57.540 --> 18:00.600
Are you saying that you think
Everett did this to him?

18:00.640 --> 18:04.349
Not Mr. Keck, a partner
whom we have yet to identify.

18:04.380 --> 18:06.803
(quietly):
Oh...

18:06.850 --> 18:10.786
Well, that actually
makes... sense.

18:10.820 --> 18:12.515
When I found Cal,

18:12.550 --> 18:16.156
that's-that's
what I thought, too.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.751
What do you mean?

18:19.790 --> 18:23.624
Well, just the-the things
that I saw...

18:23.670 --> 18:24.796
This mirror was smashed.

18:24.830 --> 18:26.525
It had to be replaced.

18:26.570 --> 18:28.663
There was a bump
on his head.

18:28.700 --> 18:31.168
I thought they were signs
of a struggle.

18:31.210 --> 18:35.635
But the paramedics told me
that sometimes this happens.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.478
Someone will have
a heart attack, fall down,

18:38.510 --> 18:40.512
knock things over.

18:40.550 --> 18:42.518
So where was he lying
when you found him?

18:42.550 --> 18:44.609
Right here, with his,

18:44.650 --> 18:46.641
um, head towards
the living room.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.419
All right.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.223
Here?

18:55.230 --> 18:58.688
(sighs)

19:01.540 --> 19:03.337
Was this door open?

19:03.370 --> 19:05.531
No, it was closed.

19:05.570 --> 19:07.674
Closed.

19:07.710 --> 19:10.304
What about this gash
in the molding here?

19:10.350 --> 19:11.578
Is that new?

19:11.610 --> 19:14.408
I think perhaps your husband
fell against the door?

19:14.450 --> 19:16.247
No, that shouldn't be there.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.885
We had this place painted
right before Christmas.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.683
It was perfect.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.278
(Calvin coughing)

19:22.320 --> 19:24.322
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

19:27.660 --> 19:29.491
So, what do you think?

19:29.530 --> 19:32.761
I think there was a struggle
that started here by the closet.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.768
And I'm now more certain
than ever

19:34.800 --> 19:37.667
that Mr. Keck's partner injected
a potassium chloride solution

19:37.710 --> 19:39.564
to stop Mr. Barnes's heart.

19:43.650 --> 19:47.541
None of our unsolved cases
interesting enough, huh?

19:47.580 --> 19:51.209
Got me turning heart attacks
into attempted homicides now?

19:51.250 --> 19:53.480
Well, that's just
one more case for the pile,

19:53.520 --> 19:55.454
but we are gonna
help you close it.

19:55.490 --> 19:57.754
CSU isn't. They just got back
from Calvin Barnes's place.

19:57.790 --> 20:00.224
There's plenty of blonde hair
and fingerprints,

20:00.260 --> 20:02.319
but nothing you wouldn't expect
inside the home

20:02.360 --> 20:04.225
of two blonde people
with a golden retriever.

20:04.270 --> 20:05.726
The attack was four weeks ago.

20:05.770 --> 20:07.499
That foyer has been cleaned
by housekeepers,

20:07.540 --> 20:09.690
if not the assailant himself.
BELL:
You any closer

20:09.740 --> 20:11.230
to telling me why
someone would want

20:11.270 --> 20:13.329
to kill a bunch of bees
up and down the Northeast?

20:13.380 --> 20:15.803
Well, my most promising theory
was that it was an attempt

20:15.840 --> 20:17.546
to manipulate
the commodities exchange.

20:17.580 --> 20:18.877
New York is the second largest

20:18.910 --> 20:20.719
grower of apples
in the United States.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.945
The business is reliant
on pollination by bees,

20:22.980 --> 20:25.312
so, it would most assuredly
be impacted.

20:25.350 --> 20:28.649
But, as it turns out, no one has
been shorting the industry.

20:28.690 --> 20:30.248
So you're back to square one.

20:30.290 --> 20:32.383
Well, maybe one and a half.

20:32.430 --> 20:33.749
I have another theory.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.028
You know that apiary summit

20:35.060 --> 20:37.324
you were talking about
in Garrison?

20:37.370 --> 20:39.565
Every researcher
attending has motive.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.965
How do you figure?

20:41.000 --> 20:43.400
Colony collapse rates
have improved since 2011.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.328
Research funding has begun
to dry up.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.270
This new scare
could be the work

20:47.310 --> 20:49.005
of _an academic
rattling his tin cup.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.747
It's worth a trip to New Jersey
to find out, right?

20:51.780 --> 20:54.772
You seriously think someone

20:54.820 --> 20:56.572
from the USDA is behind
these numbers?

20:56.620 --> 20:58.838
Evidence is quite compelling,
is it not?

20:58.890 --> 21:02.587
No. No way. You can't just
write off a global issue

21:02.620 --> 21:03.951
because one guy went
on a bee-killing spree.

21:03.990 --> 21:06.049
HOLMES:
I share your concerns

21:06.090 --> 21:08.593
about Colony Collapse Disorder
writ large, I do.

21:08.630 --> 21:10.689
I have hives of my own.

21:10.730 --> 21:12.698
But your degree
is in entomology, and, uh,

21:12.730 --> 21:14.664
the mathematicians have spoken.

21:14.700 --> 21:18.807
Uh, Griff? Come here.
You should hear this.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.330
This is my husband,
Griffin Parker.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.836
He's a professor here, too.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.643
They think some USDA guy...

21:23.680 --> 21:26.706
Everett Keck.
They think
he was dropping mites

21:26.750 --> 21:29.844
in hives all over New York and
Connecticut the past few months.

21:29.880 --> 21:32.440
The purpose of your summit is
to study this year's spike

21:32.490 --> 21:35.357
in Colony Collapse Disorder
and find answers.

21:35.390 --> 21:37.688
We submit you might be holding
those answers in your hands.

21:37.730 --> 21:40.449
So, this guy's, what, insane?

21:40.500 --> 21:41.853
Or just a canny fund-raiser.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.494
We think he has a partner
who may have a way

21:44.530 --> 21:46.020
to cash in on the
higher CCD numbers.

21:46.070 --> 21:48.937
Do you know if any
of your attendees

21:48.970 --> 21:50.858
are writing grant proposals
to study the outbreak?

21:50.910 --> 21:53.970
Offhand, no,
but it's a safe bet someone is.

21:54.010 --> 21:55.978
But the outcry
for this summit

21:56.010 --> 21:58.342
has come from all corners.
I mean, everyone

21:58.380 --> 21:59.802
is worried about
what's happening here

21:59.850 --> 22:01.408
in the tri-state area,
where it goes next year.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.748
Well, you're not wrong
about the funds drying up.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.712
We're the only entomology
department in the radius

22:05.750 --> 22:08.014
of the outbreak that had
the cash to host this thing.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.756
To our point-- many of your
colleagues, less fortunate.

22:10.790 --> 22:12.655
It would be a great help
to us if you could give us

22:12.690 --> 22:14.055
a list of your
esteemed guests.

22:16.530 --> 22:19.624
The people you're talking
about... are scientists.

22:19.670 --> 22:21.092
Not murderers.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.028
The frequency of overlap
between those two vocations

22:23.070 --> 22:24.606
might surprise you.

22:26.070 --> 22:27.537
Thank you.

22:29.710 --> 22:30.699
His Highness
Sheik Nasser Al-Fayed

22:30.750 --> 22:32.103
is making an appearance?

22:32.150 --> 22:33.811
Supposedly.

22:33.850 --> 22:35.442
Nasser is an emir.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.482
He's a member of the royal
family of Al Qasr

22:37.520 --> 22:39.442
in the United Arab Emirates.

22:39.490 --> 22:41.412
He's a black sheep.
He's not trusted

22:43.560 --> 22:46.950
He's also got the most expensive
apiary on the planet.

22:46.990 --> 22:49.527
State-of-the-art hives.
He's a recluse.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.824
Rumors on BeeCircuit.com
are that he never leaves

22:51.870 --> 22:54.065
his family's estate.
Well, I wouldn't, either.

22:54.100 --> 22:57.968
He has almost 1,000 species.
Uh, we were surprised

22:58.010 --> 22:59.932
he RSVP'd, but I guess
he made the trip,

22:59.970 --> 23:02.074
'cause he asked for a car
serwce to pick him up

23:02.110 --> 23:03.907
in the city tonight.
Staying here in New York?

23:03.950 --> 23:05.872
The Cardiff. Downtown.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.071
You keep checking your watch.

23:10.120 --> 23:13.044
Yeah. I forgot how long it
takes to get over the river.

23:13.090 --> 23:14.717
I managed to get a copy of

23:14.760 --> 23:16.409
the five-one's
property room log book.

23:16.460 --> 23:18.883
I'm supposed to meet
a handwriting expert
in 30 minutes.

23:18.930 --> 23:20.557
He's gonna tell me
whether or not

23:20.600 --> 23:23.194
Ann Vescey has forged
any signatures in it.

23:23.230 --> 23:25.095
You cohabitate with
one of the foremost

23:25.130 --> 23:27.439
forensic document examiners
on the planet.

23:27.470 --> 23:28.994
You might have saved
yourself the expense.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.201
You're not supposed to know
any of this, remember?

23:31.240 --> 23:32.901
Well, should you require
a second opinion,

23:32.940 --> 23:34.703
I'll be at the Cardiff.

23:34.740 --> 23:35.900
Oh, so you're looking
into that sheik, right?

23:35.940 --> 23:37.476
He's loaded.

23:37.510 --> 23:39.068
So if he wanted money
for research,

23:39.110 --> 23:40.941
why couldn't he just
use his own?

23:42.050 --> 23:43.915
and his family
are indeed loaded.

23:43.950 --> 23:45.645
They stay that way thanks
to their many business holdings.

23:45.690 --> 23:48.488
For example, they own several
agribusinesses in Turkey,

23:48.520 --> 23:51.125
which would benefit greatly
if New York's apple orchards

23:51.160 --> 23:52.923
were to suffer_
from underpollination.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.928
Hm.

23:54.960 --> 23:58.964
I guess I could think of worse
reason to kill 100 million bees.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.865
Are you sure?

24:00.900 --> 24:04.836
Look at the bold garlands.
The-the-the short, nubby arcades

24:04.870 --> 24:06.804
in the N's.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.637
Same hand, no question.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.649
Not what you wanted
to hear, is it?

24:11.680 --> 24:14.217
To be honest, I'm not really
sure what I wanted to hear.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.571
(phone buzzes)

24:16.620 --> 24:18.611
Excuse me.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.227
Hey.
Did you talk to the sheik?

24:24.260 --> 24:27.149
I did not.
No one's seen him in 24 hours.

24:27.190 --> 24:28.851
Did he check out?

24:28.900 --> 24:30.219
Not exactly.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.899
Yesterday morning,
guests on this floor

24:32.930 --> 24:36.866
were questioned by panicked
Arab men wearing suits.

24:36.900 --> 24:38.868
Mr. Al-Fayed's bodyguards

24:38.910 --> 24:41.174
were trying and failing
to locate him.

24:41.210 --> 24:42.871
This was troubling,

24:42.910 --> 24:44.878
so I availed myself
of a maid's key card

24:44.910 --> 24:47.208
to have _a look
around his swte.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.775
I'm now reasonably certain

24:49.820 --> 24:51.811
the emir has been kidnapped.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.683
I was told you needed
my assistance

24:58.730 --> 25:00.550
in contacting Sheik Nasser.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.589
Now this gentleman says

25:01.630 --> 25:02.949
that he has been
kidnapped.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.160
You'll have to excuse
my colleague,

25:04.200 --> 25:05.963
uh, Mr. A! Shamsi.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.629
The NYPD isn't ready
to go that far.

25:09.670 --> 25:12.161
For now, we consider this
a missing person's case.

25:12.210 --> 25:14.007
We were hoping that you would
be able put us in touch

25:14.040 --> 25:15.974
with the sheik's
security detail.

25:16.010 --> 25:18.979
One of his guards,
Rasheed Musharakh,

25:19.010 --> 25:20.978
is of particular
interest to us.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.248
Why?

25:22.280 --> 25:24.942
Because we feel
he may be respon5ible.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.548
WATSON:
Every guest on
the sheik's floor

25:26.590 --> 25:28.057
was questioned.
A few remembered

25:28.090 --> 25:29.318
a guard stationed

25:29.360 --> 25:31.555
outside his door
two nights ago-- Rasheed.

25:31.590 --> 25:33.251
The next day, when all the
other guards were rushing

25:33.290 --> 25:35.622
around in a panic,
Rasheed was nowhere to be seen.

25:35.660 --> 25:38.060
And now he just
cannot be found.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.318
And this hearsay
is the basis of your contention

25:40.370 --> 25:42.099
that Mr. Musharakh absconded

25:42.140 --> 25:44.802
with his charge?
There was no
blood at the scene,

25:44.840 --> 25:45.932
no sign of a struggle.

25:45.970 --> 25:47.904
But then, there
wouldn't be if Rasheed

25:47.940 --> 25:50.033
had just walked him
out of a fire exit.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.674
Well, nor would there be
if he just checked out

25:52.710 --> 25:54.268
and found _
alternate accommodations.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.049
A possibility.

25:56.080 --> 25:59.049
If he had not
abandoned his epinephrine

25:59.090 --> 26:00.717
with the rest
of his toiletries.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.910
It's prescribed for
a deathly peanut allergy

26:02.960 --> 26:05.781
and I doubt he would willfully
travel without it.

26:05.830 --> 26:06.956
WATSON: Do you have
numbers for either

26:06.990 --> 26:09.026
of them--
something we could trace?

26:09.060 --> 26:10.789
I'm afraid
it would be impossible

26:10.830 --> 26:12.366
to provide you
with such information.

26:12.400 --> 26:13.128
Why is that?

26:13.170 --> 26:14.990
Well, as you said,

26:15.040 --> 26:17.190
we can't say for certain
a crime has been committed.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.969
Our UN. mission
does not exist

26:19.010 --> 26:21.228
to strong-arm our citizens

26:21.280 --> 26:23.032
into American police stations.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.947
A more likely explanation is
that your government has already

26:25.980 --> 26:28.676
commenced negotiations
for the sheik's safe return.

26:28.720 --> 26:32.315
On that point, among others,
you are entirely mistaken.

26:34.020 --> 26:35.089
What I wish to know is why

26:35.120 --> 26:36.109
you sought an audience

26:36.160 --> 26:36.910
with the sheik to begin with.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.326
We have questions
regarding a plan

26:39.360 --> 26:43.148
to foment colony collapse
disorder here in New York.

26:43.200 --> 26:46.988
Are you actually suggesting that
a member of our royal family

26:47.030 --> 26:49.339
is involved in a plot
to kill American...

26:49.370 --> 26:51.065
bees?

26:53.840 --> 26:55.979
And so this meeting
has come to an ignoble end.

26:56.010 --> 26:57.978
WATSON:
Please, Mr. A! Shamsi,

26:58.010 --> 26:59.648
we are not accusing anyone.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.170
We just want
to talk to the sheik.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.017
If you will excuse me.

27:03.050 --> 27:05.211
I have a busy day
at the mission.

27:05.250 --> 27:07.013
GREGSON: I'll, uh...
I'll walk you out.

27:07.050 --> 27:08.085
(elevator bell dings)

27:13.900 --> 27:16.152
Anyone ever tell you
you're not much of a statesman?

27:16.200 --> 27:18.862
Some statesmen have.
What was that in there?

27:18.900 --> 27:20.390
What makes you think that
they're already negotiating

27:20.430 --> 27:22.034
to get the sheik back?

27:22.070 --> 27:23.867
He didn't bat an eyelid
when I told him

27:23.910 --> 27:25.730
a member of the royal family
had been kidnapped.

27:25.770 --> 27:27.977
I don't believe
even the gifted diplomat

27:28.010 --> 27:29.204
could maintain
that kind of equanimity

27:29.240 --> 27:30.798
unless his office

27:30.850 --> 27:31.999
had already been
contacted with demands.

27:32.050 --> 27:33.813
Makes sense, right?

27:33.850 --> 27:36.978
The kidnapper has already had
the sheik for 24 hours.

27:37.020 --> 27:38.988
If the plan was to
ransom him, why wait?

27:39.020 --> 27:41.215
What I'd like to know is what
the hell any of this has to do

27:41.260 --> 27:43.114
with Everett Keck
killing a bunch of bees.

27:43.160 --> 27:46.721
So you thought that the sheik
was his partner, right?

27:46.760 --> 27:48.250
It's a distinct possibility.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.450
How his abduction relates
to the colony collapse hoax--

27:50.500 --> 27:52.889
whether it relates at all--
is, at the moment,

27:52.930 --> 27:55.467
a Gordian knot of seemingly
unrelated threads.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.434
Well, let's put the bee thing
aside for now

27:57.470 --> 27:58.903
and find this Rashid guy.

27:58.940 --> 28:00.032
If he's got the sheik,

28:00.070 --> 28:01.776
chances are he's got
some answers, too.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.744
We'll _see how the detective
is coming along.

28:03.780 --> 28:04.849
I need a minute.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.848
Can you talk?

28:11.920 --> 28:14.150
I take it you're done
looking into Ann Vescey?

28:14.190 --> 28:15.384
Iam.

28:15.420 --> 28:17.081
And as it turns out,

28:17.120 --> 28:18.724
you couldn't ask
for a better replacement.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.819
Great boss, loved and respected
by all of her people.

28:20.860 --> 28:22.396
And as far as that
property room scandal,

28:22.430 --> 28:24.466
the only discrepancy in the log

28:24.500 --> 28:26.058
that wasn't accounted for

28:26.100 --> 28:27.931
was the work of
a female undercover,

28:27.970 --> 28:29.938
who has already taken
forced retirement, so...

28:29.970 --> 28:32.404
Congratulations,
if you want to move on.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.806
Uh... you'll be leaving the 11th
in good hands.

28:36.540 --> 28:37.973
Hmm.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.148
Okay.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.186
You're having second thoughts?

28:54.960 --> 28:56.894
You know, I know a thing or two

28:56.930 --> 28:59.899
about big career changes.

28:59.930 --> 29:01.795
Maybe I can help.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.809
I love what we do.

29:04.840 --> 29:07.001
You, me, Marcus, Holmes,

29:07.040 --> 29:09.235
everyone--
what we do

29:09.280 --> 29:11.475
for the city,
people that need our help.

29:11.510 --> 29:14.968
It's not just some report
that shows up on my desk.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.214
I see it.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.140
I'm a part of this.

29:23.060 --> 29:25.119
Whatever decision you make,

29:25.160 --> 29:27.355
I have no doubt
it'll be the right one.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.295
That's right. We've been calling
currency exchanges

29:34.340 --> 29:36.331
all over the city,
looking for Mr. Musharakh.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.332
Well, we don't know
the guy he kidnapped

29:39.370 --> 29:42.168
is traveling with UAE Dirhams,
but he's a sheik.

29:42.210 --> 29:45.907
"Stands to reason" is how
one of my colleagues put it.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.214
Yeah, okay.
Thanks.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.138
No luck on Staten Island?

29:50.180 --> 29:52.842
Not a high destination for
vacationing emirs, apparently.

29:52.890 --> 29:54.448
Not on vacation.

29:54.490 --> 29:57.550
Yeah, well, I'm starting to feel
like a telemarketer here.

29:59.030 --> 30:00.224
I may have something.

30:00.260 --> 30:02.251
Atlas Exchange in Parkchester.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.029
A clerk there saw a man

30:04.070 --> 30:05.219
matching Rashid's description

30:05.270 --> 30:07.488
come in with $20,000 Dirhams
last night.

30:09.500 --> 30:12.105
Well, the detective and I
will investigate posthaste.

30:12.140 --> 30:13.266
Why do you get to go?

30:13.310 --> 30:15.278
Because I stood up first.

30:15.310 --> 30:17.301
And as tiresome as calling
these establishments may be,

30:17.340 --> 30:19.171
one of us has
to finish the list.

30:19.210 --> 30:20.575
We can't put all our eggs
in one basket, can we?

30:25.450 --> 30:27.486
I've interviewed blind men who
were better witnesses than that.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.556
Three of them.
No, four.

30:29.590 --> 30:32.229
Can't fault the owner for having
a broken surveillance system.

30:32.260 --> 30:33.557
Of course I could.

30:33.590 --> 30:35.023
If it had been broken.

30:35.060 --> 30:37.255
Footage was black.

30:37.300 --> 30:39.222
That man's fleecing
his customers.

30:39.270 --> 30:41.591
He wiped the tape himself when
he heard we were en route.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.302
Didn't want to hand us
a record of his crimes.

30:47.070 --> 30:48.230
Holmes.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.976
Indulge me a moment, would you?

30:51.010 --> 30:52.443
MAN: Yeah, that, uh...

30:52.480 --> 30:54.141
that might have been
the guy who was in here.

30:54.180 --> 30:56.239
Really?
Yeah.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.349
Because the watch
in this photograph,

30:57.380 --> 30:58.586
the same one
that you have

30:58.620 --> 31:00.247
on display here,

31:00.290 --> 31:01.609
could lift 100

31:01.660 --> 31:03.389
of Nasser Al-Fayed's
countrymen out of poverty,

31:03.420 --> 31:05.354
and he's probably got
a drawer full of them,

31:05.390 --> 31:07.585
so I doubt that he pawned
this one here in the Bronx.

31:07.630 --> 31:10.019
You sure you didn't
buy it off this guy?

31:10.060 --> 31:11.527
He was selling off
the sheik's assets

31:11.570 --> 31:13.424
up and down this block
last night.

31:13.470 --> 31:16.234
I can't be sure. Uh...
BELL:
Look, man,

31:16.270 --> 31:18.363
we don't care if you didn't ask
for proof of ownership.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.002
(sighs)

31:20.040 --> 31:21.234
Yeah, this was the guy,
right here.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.407
Yeah, he brought in the watch.

31:23.440 --> 31:25.340
How much he take for it?
Six.

31:25.380 --> 31:26.870
And a laptop in trade.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.170
Now, I hope you're
not gonna tell us

31:30.220 --> 31:31.687
your surveillance
system's broken.

31:31.720 --> 31:34.086
PAWNBROKER:
No. What, are you kidding?
I've been robbed

31:34.120 --> 31:35.485
ten times in
the last couple years.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.078
These cameras stop working,
so do I.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.656
You mind getting the tape
from last night for us?

31:38.690 --> 31:40.248
I think we can do
better than a tape.

31:40.290 --> 31:42.554
There's anti-theft
tracking software

31:42.600 --> 31:44.261
on all the electronic
goods here.

31:44.300 --> 31:46.427
Well, like I said,
we've had robberies.

31:46.470 --> 31:49.997
Do you deactivate the software
once a sale is made?

31:50.040 --> 31:51.928
ANNOUNCER: ...and Chamberlain
will send it forward,

31:51.970 --> 31:52.937
down the right side.

31:52.970 --> 31:54.574
Alvarez there to collect.

31:54.610 --> 31:56.475
But no,
Muncie powers him off it,

31:56.510 --> 31:58.478
and there's no foul; Alvarez--

31:58.510 --> 32:00.046
(sudden bang)

32:00.080 --> 32:02.219
Hands up!
Get on the ground, now!

32:02.250 --> 32:03.239
Give me your hands!

32:03.280 --> 32:05.089
Clear!

32:05.120 --> 32:06.439
WATSON:
There wasn't any sign
of the sheik?

32:06.490 --> 32:07.980
Nope.

32:08.020 --> 32:10.159
Still no answer
at the UAE's mission.

32:10.190 --> 32:11.418
Nobody knows anything,

32:11.460 --> 32:13.155
and Rashid's got a bridge
he wants to sell us.

32:13.190 --> 32:14.418
WATSON:
What do you mean?

32:14.460 --> 32:16.121
Rashid...

32:16.160 --> 32:17.388
tell these people
what you told me.

32:17.430 --> 32:20.160
What?
That's I'm innocent?

32:20.200 --> 32:21.269
I told this man

32:21.300 --> 32:22.267
I did not take the sheik.

32:22.300 --> 32:24.268
I don't know anything.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.198
Well, we might as well
get a full account of
what you don't know,

32:26.240 --> 32:28.037
so let's start at
the beginning, shall we?

32:28.080 --> 32:30.332
Are you aware
of a plot to spread

32:30.380 --> 32:31.472
colony collapse disorder
in New York?

32:31.510 --> 32:32.499
Colony what?

32:32.550 --> 32:34.347
Do the names Everett Keck

32:34.380 --> 32:36.109
and Calvin Barnes
mean anything to you?

32:36.150 --> 32:37.117
No.

32:37.150 --> 32:38.139
All I know is simple:

32:38.190 --> 32:40.442
Two nights ago, I was assigned
to the emir's door.

32:40.490 --> 32:43.118
He was inside, with a...

32:43.160 --> 32:45.185
a prostitute.

32:45.230 --> 32:46.356
His taste.

32:46.390 --> 32:49.393
Blonde. Tall.

32:49.430 --> 32:51.398
A beauty mark above the lip.

32:51.430 --> 32:53.398
I never left my post,

32:53.430 --> 32:55.364
but in the morning,
they were both gone.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.231
Vanished
into thin air.

32:57.270 --> 32:59.704
I only ran because
I know it makes no sense.

32:59.740 --> 33:01.537
The sheik was
my responsibility.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.468
If you turn me over,

33:03.510 --> 33:05.546
I'll be luclq to be buried
with my head.

33:05.580 --> 33:07.468
We can't promise
you anything.

33:07.510 --> 33:10.479
But the NYPD can petition
the DA for lenience

33:10.520 --> 33:12.442
and refugee status
for helpful witnesses.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.788
Hold up. You're buying this?

33:14.820 --> 33:16.788
I said earlier
this case was a Gordian knot.

33:16.820 --> 33:18.583
This man has just given us
a sword

33:18.630 --> 33:20.382
with which to cut it.

33:20.430 --> 33:23.319
When he says the sheik
and his courtesan vanished

33:23.360 --> 33:25.089
into thin air,
I believe him.

33:25.130 --> 33:29.635
I also think
I know where they materialized.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.300
WOMAN:
This is from BeeCircuit.com.

33:36.340 --> 33:38.399
It's a thread about the
evolution of leafcutter bees.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.372
Why are you showing this to me?

33:40.410 --> 33:42.241
Page four,

33:42.280 --> 33:44.646
post 103.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.487
You'll see the moment
that you decided to lure

33:46.520 --> 33:49.409
Sheik Nasser Al-Fayed
to the United States.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.189
You proposed a meeting
in person.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.448
_ This? This was
just me being nice.

33:53.490 --> 33:56.459
So nice he invited you
to tour his hives in Al Qasr.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.491
"I'll fly you in.
Ticket for one.

33:58.530 --> 34:00.168
You can't bring
your husband."

34:00.200 --> 34:01.565
I turned him down
in the next post.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.397
HOLMES:
Probably because you knew
it would be easier

34:03.440 --> 34:06.534
to abduct and ransom him here,
away from his family compound.

34:06.570 --> 34:09.209
What?
WATSON: Three nights ago,
he disappeared,

34:09.240 --> 34:11.401
shortly after his guards
let a prostitute,

34:11.450 --> 34:14.339
matching your description,
into his hotel suite.

34:14.380 --> 34:16.177
Please tell me you didn't ask me
to come here

34:16.220 --> 34:18.518
just because I got some unwanted
attention on a message board.

34:18.550 --> 34:21.110
You gave as good as you got.
Privately, of course.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.549
I'm friendly with the moderator
of BeeCircuit.com.

34:23.590 --> 34:25.421
You deleted
your private messages,

34:25.460 --> 34:27.348
but he was able to dredge these

34:27.390 --> 34:28.721
off the server.

34:28.760 --> 34:30.728
There are hundreds of messages.

34:30.760 --> 34:32.489
A dozen invitations to New York.

34:32.530 --> 34:34.259
You even dyed your hair blonde

34:34.300 --> 34:35.767
after you found out
that's what he likes.

34:35.800 --> 34:38.530
You were quite eager
to show off your new look.

34:42.310 --> 34:44.278
GRIFFIN:
No.

34:44.310 --> 34:46.107
I, uh...

34:46.150 --> 34:47.777
actually hadn't seen these.

34:47.810 --> 34:50.472
But I was
aware of them.

34:50.520 --> 34:54.581
Tara told me about
the... flirtation.

34:54.620 --> 34:57.589
But that's-that's all
in the past now.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.554
Our relationship is great.

34:59.590 --> 35:00.386
Really?

35:00.430 --> 35:01.590
Yeah. We just booked

35:01.630 --> 35:03.393
a second honeymoon in Vietnam.

35:03.430 --> 35:05.660
A non-extradition country.
How hearbNarming.

35:05.700 --> 35:07.497
_ And all it took
to bring you closer together

35:07.530 --> 35:09.634
was a kidnapping
and an attempted murder.

35:09.670 --> 35:12.207
So Griffin is in on it with me?

35:12.240 --> 35:14.333
Someone had to work the winch.
What winch?

35:14.380 --> 35:16.200
The one that was attached
to the balcony railing

35:16.240 --> 35:18.208
above the sheik's room.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.206
Someone had to work it
to haul you both up,

35:20.250 --> 35:21.649
away from Nasser's guards.

35:21.680 --> 35:22.817
HOLMES:
It wasn't the third member

35:22.850 --> 35:24.647
of your cabal, Everett Keck.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.214
He'd been murdered
the day before.

35:26.250 --> 35:27.786
The guy
who killed all those bees?

35:27.820 --> 35:30.186
Oh, so we're part
of that thing now, too?

35:30.220 --> 35:32.188
Your online seduction
was not suffICIent.

35:32.230 --> 35:34.255
The sheik was unwilling
to leave his kingdom.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.495
So, knowing
that his first passion was bees,

35:36.530 --> 35:39.590
you set in motion
an apiary apocalypse.

35:39.630 --> 35:42.599
Everett Keck caused a spike
in CCD so drastic

35:42.640 --> 35:45.336
that the sheik had no choice
but to come to your summit.

35:45.370 --> 35:48.339
Killing bees
to lure an oddball sheik.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.904
Really?

35:49.940 --> 35:52.670
I admit, it's a plan
almost too deranged

35:52.710 --> 35:55.838
to describe out loud, and yet...

35:55.880 --> 35:57.541
it worked.

35:57.580 --> 35:58.649
Eventually.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.544
Only real speed bump
was Calvin Barnes.

36:00.590 --> 36:02.888
He was catching on to Keck,

36:02.920 --> 36:05.480
so while Keck alibied himself
in Connecticut,

36:05.530 --> 36:06.952
you ambushed Barnes in his home,

36:06.990 --> 36:08.628
and shot him up
with potassium chloride

36:08.660 --> 36:10.355
to give him a heart attack.

36:10.400 --> 36:11.822
I've never seen that man before.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.566
And I didn't do any
of the things you say I did.

36:14.600 --> 36:17.592
You should know we've got you
and your husband on video,

36:17.640 --> 36:20.268
checking into the sheik's hotel
the night he disappeared.

36:20.310 --> 36:22.335
We know you were in the
room right above him.

36:22.380 --> 36:23.608
And we found damage
to the railing

36:23.640 --> 36:24.948
where the winch was attached.

36:24.980 --> 36:26.379
HOLMES:
You've gone back

36:26.410 --> 36:27.741
to your natural color.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.441
Did you do that
after the kidnapping

36:29.480 --> 36:30.879
to avoid being identified?

36:33.790 --> 36:35.951
Has anyone tried calling him?

36:35.990 --> 36:37.753
Has anyone tried calling who?

36:37.790 --> 36:38.825
The sheik.

36:38.860 --> 36:40.350
I mean, sure,

36:40.390 --> 36:41.926
Griffin and I were
at the same hotel.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.655
That's not a crime.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.691
You've obviously done a lot
of work here.

36:45.730 --> 36:48.563
But has anyone actually talked
to Nasser?

36:48.600 --> 36:50.465
Kidnapped men are difficult
to get hold of.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.865
Well, I think
you should keep trying.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.866
In fact, I think you
should try right now.

36:53.910 --> 36:57.630
Maybe you could spare yourself
any more embarrassment.

36:59.350 --> 37:00.703
The United Arab Emirates

37:00.750 --> 37:03.014
and their spokesman,
Mr. A! Shamsi,

37:03.050 --> 37:05.746
would like us to know
that Sheik Nasser is resting

37:05.790 --> 37:09.954
on his plane home and is
unavailable for questioning.

37:09.990 --> 37:11.628
They paid the ransom.

37:11.660 --> 37:13.753
But they're claiming
he was never taken.

37:13.790 --> 37:15.758
Why?
Because if word gets out

37:15.800 --> 37:17.392
they negotiate with kidnappers,

37:17.430 --> 37:18.761
it'll be open season
on their people.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.688
Cheaper in
the long run

37:20.730 --> 37:23.290
to pretend none
of this ever happened.
Not to mention

37:23.340 --> 37:25.035
less embarrassing.
They also said

37:25.070 --> 37:27.459
this was the last time
they'd take any of my calls.

37:27.510 --> 37:28.738
HOLMES:
Perhaps it's time

37:28.780 --> 37:30.736
to involve DHS.

37:30.780 --> 37:33.340
See if we can get a warrant
to seek out any large transfers

37:33.380 --> 37:35.439
emanating from Al Qasr.

37:35.480 --> 37:37.744
We may be able to tell whether
the Parkers secured their bounty

37:37.780 --> 37:40.749
in Switzerland
or the Cayman Islands.
Why?

37:40.790 --> 37:42.712
Jusﬁce?
_ I'm familiar
With the concept,

37:42.760 --> 37:44.887
but it's gonna be difficult
to prosecute a crime

37:44.930 --> 37:47.626
where the victim is gonna swear
it didn't take place.

37:47.660 --> 37:49.457
They didn't just kidnap
the sheik.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.593
There's Calvin Barnes,
the bees...

37:51.630 --> 37:53.894
Then get me some proof
of any of it.

37:53.930 --> 37:57.696
'Cause as it stands now,
I got to cut the Parkers loose.

37:57.740 --> 37:59.628
If you do, they'll be on
the next flight to Haiphong.

37:59.670 --> 38:00.830
Then you
better hurry.

38:00.870 --> 38:02.679
'Cause I got no choice.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.905
(footsteps approaching)

38:07.950 --> 38:10.339
Okay, those
are not evidence.

38:10.380 --> 38:11.642
Aren't they?

38:11.690 --> 38:14.579
Of low self-esteem? Definitely.
Of a crime...?

38:14.620 --> 38:16.588
What did the lab have to say
about the stray hairs found

38:16.620 --> 38:17.882
at Calvin Barnes's home?

38:17.920 --> 38:20.525
Most of them belonged
to his Wife, a feW to the dog,

38:20.560 --> 38:23.859
and there was one
that was not a match for anyone.

38:23.900 --> 38:25.788
It was dyed blonde.
Just like Tara Parker's hair.

38:25.830 --> 38:27.821
She was there
the night he was attacked.

38:27.870 --> 38:29.929
I would say we should get
a DNA sample to confirm,

38:29.970 --> 38:31.631
but what would be
the point?

38:31.670 --> 38:33.103
When there's no proof
that a crime was committed,

38:33.140 --> 38:34.801
and as far as the world
is concerned,

38:34.840 --> 38:37.070
Calvin Barnes
just had a heart attack.

38:37.110 --> 38:39.408
And as far as Sheik
Nasser is concerned,
he was never kidnapped.

38:39.450 --> 38:42.419
The Parkers have a_ knack
for committing crimes

38:42.450 --> 38:44.941
that cannot be
identified as such.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.049
Probably Why they're gonna
spend the rest of their days

38:47.090 --> 38:49.684
sipping drinks on
a Vietnamese beach.

38:49.720 --> 38:52.883
They're not good--
they're lucky.
I don't disagree.

38:52.930 --> 38:54.727
Otherwise Everett Keck
would still be alive,

38:54.760 --> 38:56.728
and they'd have to split
their money three ways.

38:56.760 --> 38:59.866
As it is, they get
to keep the Whole pot.

39:01.940 --> 39:04.329
You're not seriously
gonna leave those up all night.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.506
Everett Keck.

39:13.550 --> 39:15.711
The day he died, he was wearing
a T-shirt that said,

39:15.750 --> 39:17.877
"Buddhists do it
to attain Inner Peace."

39:17.920 --> 39:19.808
_ So?
His autopsy report

39:19.850 --> 39:22.648
also revealed he'd taken Viagra
the night before.

39:22.690 --> 39:24.419
Okay, I'll bite.

39:24.460 --> 39:26.052
What does Buddhism have to do
with erectile dysfunction?

39:26.090 --> 39:28.752
If I'm right, Watson,
everything we want it to.

39:30.630 --> 39:32.598
Mrs. Parker, do you
understand your rights

39:32.630 --> 39:34.063
as they've been read to you?

39:34.100 --> 39:35.829
Yes.

39:35.870 --> 39:37.735
What I understand
is that you're desperate.

39:37.770 --> 39:39.408
Griff and I leave for
our trip tonight.

39:39.440 --> 39:40.737
You want to try to delay us.

39:40.770 --> 39:41.771
It's funny
you should mention Griff.

39:41.810 --> 39:42.879
He's the reason we're here.

39:42.910 --> 39:43.877
He gave you up this morning.

39:43.910 --> 39:45.400
Sure, he did.

39:45.450 --> 39:46.872
You don't believe us?

39:46.910 --> 39:48.571
I know how this works.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.417
Right now, some other cop
is arresting him,

39:50.450 --> 39:52.042
saying I gave him up.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.978
You want us to turn against
each other, but we won't.

39:54.020 --> 39:55.783
We didn't do anything.

39:55.820 --> 39:56.855
But you did,
as a matter of fact.

39:56.890 --> 39:58.755
You both got
master's degrees.

39:58.790 --> 40:00.052
What are you talking about?

40:00.090 --> 40:01.955
Well, you both have your
degrees in agriculture.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.793
But this scarlet academic hood
that you're wearing

40:06.830 --> 40:09.435
denotes a degree in theology.

40:09.470 --> 40:11.904
It belongs to your lover,
Everett Keck.

40:11.940 --> 40:13.703
Like many a theology major,

40:13.740 --> 40:15.833
Keck ultimately had to find work
in another field.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.178
So he put his minor
in entomology to good use,

40:18.210 --> 40:19.871
joining the USDA.

40:19.910 --> 40:21.207
WATSON:
Your husband knew
you were sending

40:21.250 --> 40:22.649
racy pictures to Sheik Nasser.

40:22.680 --> 40:23.908
He was okay with that.

40:23.950 --> 40:25.110
What he wasn't okay with

40:25.150 --> 40:26.947
was you taking this one
at Keck's house,

40:26.990 --> 40:28.912
wearing Keck's robe.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.724
HOLMES:
Until this morning, he'd never
taken a good look at this.

40:31.760 --> 40:34.820
But when we were able
to procure this very robe

40:34.860 --> 40:37.055
from Keck's residence,
along With dyed blonde hairs

40:37.100 --> 40:39.466
from his shower and bed,

40:39.500 --> 40:41.559
Griff became quite talkative.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.067
You got away
with kidnapping the sheik.

40:43.100 --> 40:45.739
You won't get away with
what you did to Calvin Barnes.

40:45.770 --> 40:47.658
Or millions of bees.

40:50.010 --> 40:52.604
I don't understand.

40:52.650 --> 40:55.574
(chuckles)
You're giving this back?

40:55.620 --> 40:56.871
I can't take the promotion, Pat.

40:56.920 --> 40:58.683
I'm grateful-- to you,

40:58.720 --> 41:02.110
. to _the commissioner--
It's just not right for me.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.809
Not right now.

41:03.860 --> 41:05.179
Tommy, offers

41:05.230 --> 41:06.822
like this don't come around
every day.

41:06.860 --> 41:08.225
I get that. And I get

41:08.260 --> 41:10.228
that one may not
come my way again.

41:10.260 --> 41:11.989
But the truth is,

41:12.030 --> 41:15.067
the 11th is where
I want to be.

41:16.940 --> 41:19.864
Youngest detective in
the history of the 14th Squad.

41:19.910 --> 41:22.174
Head of Major Case at 40.

41:22.210 --> 41:24.508
Lacks ambition?

41:24.550 --> 41:25.744
Am I missing something?

41:25.780 --> 41:27.975
My ambition's being met.

41:28.010 --> 41:29.944
Right here.

41:32.920 --> 41:35.718
I guess you're right.

41:35.760 --> 41:38.081
I should take this back.

41:43.030 --> 41:45.999
Moves like this, Tommy--
people coming, people going--

41:46.030 --> 41:48.225
they get made two ways:

41:48.270 --> 41:52.104
Sometimes it's the carrot,
sometimes it's the stick.

41:52.140 --> 41:54.233
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

41:54.270 --> 41:56.773
It means _
I've been around a long time.

41:56.810 --> 41:59.278
I think I know a lifeboat
when I see one.

41:59.310 --> 42:02.609
Are you saying somebody wants me
off this desk?

42:02.650 --> 42:04.709
I just know
that this came from on high.

42:04.750 --> 42:07.810
It was something
that was supposed to happen.

42:07.850 --> 42:10.614
Why?

42:10.660 --> 42:15.723
Maybe there are problems in
the 11th you don't know about.

42:15.760 --> 42:19.662
(chuckles) Maybe Ann Vescey
has more friends than you do.

42:20.670 --> 42:22.934
Or maybe I'm just wrong.

42:22.970 --> 42:24.961
It has been known to happen.

42:30.380 --> 42:32.974
Be happy here, Tommy.

42:33.010 --> 42:35.012
Just... don't be comfortable.
