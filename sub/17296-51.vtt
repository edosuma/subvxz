00:46.350 --> 00:47.612
What is all the locomotion?

00:47.656 --> 00:50.354
Beast Boy is eating us
out of house and home.

00:50.398 --> 00:53.357
It's 'cause I need some
of them good calories, yo.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.359
I'm storing up
my fats for the winter.

00:55.403 --> 00:58.362
Because it's hibernation
time, baby!

00:58.406 --> 01:01.365
That's seven and a half months
of straight-up sleeping.

01:01.409 --> 01:02.932
Seven and a half months?

01:02.975 --> 01:05.195
Bro, I'm gonna miss you so much.

01:05.239 --> 01:08.329
The who will I play
the Fetch with? The who?

01:08.372 --> 01:11.593
No Beast Boy for seven months?

01:11.636 --> 01:13.464
Let's get you fed, big guy.

01:20.341 --> 01:23.083
Feeling sleepy.

01:24.258 --> 01:25.955
Great! Bedtime.

01:28.566 --> 01:31.830
No! I can't do no
hibernations here.

01:31.874 --> 01:32.875
I needs a cave

01:32.918 --> 01:34.790
Uh, there are no
caves around here.

01:34.833 --> 01:37.097
Unless you count my man cave.

01:37.140 --> 01:39.577
Oh, yeah! Men only, baby!

01:42.102 --> 01:43.277
Sorry, ladies.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.236
No, bro. The caves
gots to be real.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.020
With them good rocks
and darknesses.

01:48.064 --> 01:51.241
But who amongst us
has access to such a cave?

01:59.989 --> 02:01.599
You know Batman.

02:01.643 --> 02:04.211
It's nice of Batman
to let us use the Batcave.

02:04.254 --> 02:05.255
You broke in!

02:05.299 --> 02:07.562
This cave is perfect, yo.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.868
Then let's get you
tucked in, bug guy.

Nooo!

02:27.364 --> 02:30.280
All I wanted was seven
and a half months of peace

02:30.324 --> 02:32.369
and quiet, but now

02:32.413 --> 02:34.154
that dream is over.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.984
Come on, let's get out of
here before Batman comes back.

02:39.028 --> 02:42.510
No way. How often do you
get to see the Batcave?

02:42.553 --> 02:44.251
I wanna check this place out.

02:56.437 --> 03:00.136
Yo, what's up
with this fireman pole?

03:00.180 --> 03:03.183
I did not know
the Batman was also the fireman.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.446
Yeah, that's right. He's a fireman.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.578
Not a billionaire playboy
named Bruce Wayne.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.711
And this, this is just
a boring old fire pole

03:09.754 --> 03:11.495
that goes to some
lame fire station.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.845
- I love fire.
- I love station.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.369
Let's go!

03:20.809 --> 03:22.158
Whoa!

03:22.202 --> 03:24.378
I didn't knows
firemans was rich.

03:24.421 --> 03:26.641
I wanna be a fireman
so I can be rich, too.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.208
Somebody start a fire.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.340
No fires!

03:30.384 --> 03:32.299
This isn't a fire station.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.563
This place is the house of lies!

03:35.606 --> 03:38.000
This place is my childhood home.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.088
Wayne Manor.

03:39.131 --> 03:41.395
Oh, snap! That means
you was rich?

03:41.438 --> 03:44.876
You must have had the wondrous
childhood of the money spending.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.270
Actually, I spent my
childhood training

03:47.314 --> 03:51.100
to become a defender of justice.

03:51.143 --> 03:53.145
Are you telling me you had
riches and didn't revel in 'em?

03:53.189 --> 03:55.539
There was a strict
no reveling policy.

03:57.411 --> 04:00.414
Money is a vice that leads
to nothing but problems.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.720
Actually, money solves
all your problems.

04:02.764 --> 04:05.375
It's a vice!

04:05.419 --> 04:07.159
Now, come on.
Let's get out of here.

04:07.203 --> 04:10.293
Sorry, bro, but we're
not leaving until we get a tour.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.164
Really?

04:12.208 --> 04:14.558
Ugh! Fine.

04:14.602 --> 04:17.909
Wayne Manor is home to many
memorable props and locations.

04:17.953 --> 04:19.998
Here we have
the super long table

04:20.042 --> 04:22.044
where Michael Keaton
had an awkward dinner date.

04:23.219 --> 04:24.264
Ooh.

04:24.307 --> 04:26.004
Hey, Mama, pass the salt.

04:27.310 --> 04:30.531
Classic long table shenoonigans.

04:30.574 --> 04:33.664
This is the whole where Christian
Bale learned why we fall.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.623
Oh, I wish to learn.

04:35.666 --> 04:36.537
Ooh-ooh!

04:38.147 --> 04:40.367
The learning is the painful.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.500
And of course, the phone
that Adam West

04:43.544 --> 04:45.459
would answer when
crime was afoot.

04:49.680 --> 04:52.988
And finally here's some stuff from
Val Kilmer and George Clooney.

04:55.686 --> 04:57.819
Any questions before
we continue the tour?

04:57.862 --> 04:59.864
Yeah, who's the creeper
following us?

04:59.908 --> 05:01.692
That's Alfred.
He's the butler.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.912
What up, butt-ler?

05:03.955 --> 05:04.869
Ooh-whee!

05:04.913 --> 05:06.349
Look at that fancy suit.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.133
He must have an important
meeting to go to.

05:08.177 --> 05:10.048
He doesn't have a meeting,
that's his uniform.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.659
He's been wearing it
for 40 years.

05:11.702 --> 05:14.662
You have kept him from
the meeting for that long?

05:14.705 --> 05:17.621
Robin, let the man
go to his meeting!

05:17.665 --> 05:19.144
Fine. Whatever.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.799
Alfred, you're free for the day.
Now, come on.

05:26.282 --> 05:28.893
Oh, what is this room
of the sadness?

05:28.937 --> 05:30.199
That's the supply room.

05:30.242 --> 05:32.332
It's right next to my room.

05:35.944 --> 05:38.120
Ah, so many wonderful memories.

05:38.163 --> 05:40.688
The weights I used
to build my amazing muscles.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.907
The bed. Where I used
to cry myself to sleep.

05:42.951 --> 05:45.388
The drain that used
to wash away my tears.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.390
And I can't forget
about you, Mr. Bucket.

05:47.434 --> 05:48.609
I missed you, buddy.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.524
Dude, where's all
your expensive stuff?

05:50.567 --> 05:53.701
Didn't you get anything
cool, like a super big TV?

05:53.744 --> 05:55.137
Or the pet that is exotic?

05:55.180 --> 05:57.618
Or a priceless piece
of art to use as a dartboard?

05:57.661 --> 06:00.577
Or fireworks made of money
that you launch into the sky?

06:00.621 --> 06:02.405
I had none of those things.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.320
I learned from Batman

06:04.364 --> 06:07.889
that frivolous materialism would
only impede the pursuit of justice.

06:07.932 --> 06:09.804
So there wasn't
anything you wanted?

06:09.847 --> 06:11.675
Well, there was one thing.

06:11.719 --> 06:15.157
I always wanted a poster
of Bell Biv DeVoe.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.377
The early '90s R&B trio

06:17.420 --> 06:19.640
that was put together after the
unfortunate demise of New Addition?

06:19.683 --> 06:23.513
Their fresh beats and their sweet
lyrics got me through some tough times.

06:23.557 --> 06:26.864
Their behind the scenes turmoil
taught me how to deal with conflict.

06:26.908 --> 06:29.867
And their elegant fusion
of R&B and new jack swing

06:29.911 --> 06:32.827
inspired my embrace
of mixed martial arts.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.829
The poster would
have gone right here.

06:34.872 --> 06:37.179
But it would have been an
unnecessary extravagance.

06:37.222 --> 06:41.618
Alls you wanted was a poster of some R&B
group and you ain'ts never gots it?

06:41.662 --> 06:44.360
That is the so, so the sad.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.927
This so the sad.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.972
Bro, you deserve to spend
some of Batman's money

06:48.016 --> 06:49.974
to have the childhood
you never had.

06:50.018 --> 06:52.020
Money is a tempting seductress.

06:52.063 --> 06:54.457
And like Bell Biv DeVoe
once sang...

06:54.501 --> 06:55.632
♪ That girl is ♪

06:57.721 --> 06:59.462
♪ Poison ♪

06:59.506 --> 07:01.812
Ah, come on.
Throw some cash around.

07:01.856 --> 07:03.335
You've earned it.

07:03.379 --> 07:05.250
But Batman needs that
cash to fight crime.

07:05.294 --> 07:07.470
You know who needs it more?

07:07.514 --> 07:10.473
The small child who
lives within your innards.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.736
The little boy
who lived in his sad room

07:12.780 --> 07:15.609
wishing for a Bell Biv DeVoe
poster that he never got.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.785
You don't think it'll
cause problems?

07:17.828 --> 07:21.049
No, dude. Money is
gonna solve your problems!

07:21.092 --> 07:23.834
I guess I could indulge.
Just this once.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.140
All right!

07:25.183 --> 07:27.316
Let's spin that money, son!

07:43.027 --> 07:47.597
Ha-ha! This
feels so good!

07:47.641 --> 07:49.904
Launch the money fireworks!

08:00.828 --> 08:04.832
Wow, I spent all that money
and nothing bad happened.

08:06.050 --> 08:08.139
That's right, bro.

08:08.183 --> 08:10.751
When you's got that money richness,
you ain't never got no problem.

08:19.368 --> 08:20.891
They're taking everything!

08:20.935 --> 08:22.414
The sweet big screen.

08:23.633 --> 08:24.721
The dartboard.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.594
The tiger that is white.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.597
Not my gold-plated armor!

08:31.859 --> 08:33.817
We have to stop them.

08:33.861 --> 08:36.603
Uh, I don't thinks we should be
messing with Batman's villains, yo.

08:36.646 --> 08:40.650
With Alfred at his meeting, we
are Wayne Manor's only defense.

08:40.694 --> 08:41.782
Titans, go!

08:48.832 --> 08:50.355
Ahh!

08:50.399 --> 08:51.443
Ah!

08:55.535 --> 08:57.319
- Aah!
- Ooh!

09:13.814 --> 09:15.337
Ow! Ouch! Ah!

09:15.380 --> 09:16.904
Stop!

09:16.947 --> 09:19.254
You guys said money
would solve my problems.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.822
This is a problem.
A big one!

09:23.084 --> 09:24.694
Batman is going to kill me.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.217
Wait. Look.

09:28.655 --> 09:29.960
Alfred!

09:49.632 --> 09:50.981
Alfred did it!

09:51.025 --> 09:53.070
Yeah. No thanks to us.

09:53.114 --> 09:54.942
It seems you were the right, Robin.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.552
Money is only the vice.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.337
Are you kidding?
My butler saved the day.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.252
That's thanks to money!

10:01.296 --> 10:03.820
If I learned anything,
it's that if you're rich,

10:03.864 --> 10:06.910
there are no consequences
to your terrible actions.

10:06.954 --> 10:10.871
Uh, but you still gonna get in
trouble with Batman for all this mess.

10:10.914 --> 10:14.048
Oh, yeah? Oh, Alfred?

10:14.091 --> 10:16.920
Clean this place up
before Batman comes home.
