WEBVTT

00:01.632 --> 00:03.687
The Governor would like
to put you on a retainer.

00:03.687 --> 00:06.194
I hear you're some kind of
fancy fixer for the Governor now.

00:06.195 --> 00:07.952
Doing for him like
you used to do for me.

00:07.953 --> 00:09.874
I just saw Doug O'Casey.

00:09.875 --> 00:11.512
- What is this?
- It's only Adderall.

00:11.513 --> 00:12.904
They sell it in school like Skittles.

00:12.905 --> 00:14.045
Are you dealing?

00:14.046 --> 00:15.313
I can take care of myself.

00:15.314 --> 00:17.183
Are you okay being here alone

00:17.184 --> 00:19.152
with me instead of with Ana?

00:19.153 --> 00:20.622
There's still something there.

00:20.623 --> 00:21.769
Something's still there.

00:21.770 --> 00:23.933
But I'm exactly where I want to be.

00:23.934 --> 00:25.755
Let's tell the world
that we're together.

00:25.756 --> 00:27.391
- You're drunk.
- I'm happy.

00:27.392 --> 00:29.678
We're doing pretty well
with our own little secret.

00:29.679 --> 00:30.959
Meet Kristy Ellis,

00:30.960 --> 00:32.512
Reef PD's one-woman Intel department.

00:33.821 --> 00:35.123
It's her again.

00:35.124 --> 00:36.450
You have my, um...

00:36.451 --> 00:37.703
You have my full attention.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.801
I can tell.

00:39.961 --> 00:41.060
You've been avoiding me.

00:41.061 --> 00:42.596
Our little rendezvous was really hot.

00:42.597 --> 00:43.856
But, you know, that's all it was.

00:43.857 --> 00:45.093
I'm here 'cause I want to be with you.

00:45.094 --> 00:46.569
Would it hurt to have
an adult conversation

00:46.570 --> 00:49.065
- every now and again?
- Conversation is overrated.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

01:05.229 --> 01:06.929
Okay.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.854
Bingo.

01:48.871 --> 01:50.205
Gotcha.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.386
Of course it's you.

02:30.387 --> 02:31.702
It's 3:00 a.m.

02:31.703 --> 02:33.214
What are you doing?

02:33.215 --> 02:34.694
I'm reading, uh,

02:34.695 --> 02:38.344
Thucydides' "The History
of the Peloponnesian Wars."

02:38.345 --> 02:39.631
Oh.

02:39.632 --> 02:41.955
Well, that sounds...

02:41.956 --> 02:43.965
- boring.
- On the contrary.

02:43.966 --> 02:46.401
The conflict between Athens and Sparta

02:46.402 --> 02:48.202
could not be more

02:48.430 --> 02:49.597
dynamically rendered.

02:49.598 --> 02:53.592
How about the dynamic between you and me

02:53.593 --> 02:55.969
and a bottle of 10-year-old bourbon?

02:55.970 --> 02:57.707
You're on the prowl again.

02:57.708 --> 02:59.940
You can never sleep after a caper.

02:59.941 --> 03:03.186
Let me in, and I'll
tell you all about it.

03:03.187 --> 03:05.779
Well... Well, it's late.
How far away are you?

03:05.780 --> 03:07.414
About 10 feet.

Now, that... was a sloop.

03:51.626 --> 03:52.992
I remember Port Moresby,

03:52.993 --> 03:56.992
and, technically, that was a ketch.

03:56.993 --> 03:59.699
You can't "ketch" me.

03:59.700 --> 04:02.834
Well, actually, I did, as I recall.

04:04.037 --> 04:05.838

04:05.839 --> 04:08.341

04:20.954 --> 04:22.223
Oh, come on.

04:22.224 --> 04:24.991
It's been in the air since
you got back on the Reef.

04:24.992 --> 04:26.159
Yeah.

04:29.397 --> 04:30.930
You don't have to...

04:30.931 --> 04:32.731

Uh, uh, you're looking for Cat now?

04:43.343 --> 04:44.675
No.

04:44.676 --> 04:45.778
Uh, no.

04:45.779 --> 04:48.747

Saved by the bell.

04:59.192 --> 05:00.350
Yeah.

05:00.351 --> 05:02.592
Whatever it is that you
can't talk to me about,

05:02.593 --> 05:05.162
she seems very anxious about it.

05:09.234 --> 05:10.703
I got to go.

05:10.704 --> 05:11.938
What?

05:11.939 --> 05:13.065

05:52.555 --> 05:54.600
You didn't make any copies, correct?

05:54.601 --> 05:57.379
Copies are extra.

05:57.380 --> 05:58.816
Let me ask you something.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.352
What is so important that you need

06:01.353 --> 06:03.530
illegally obtained photographs

06:03.531 --> 06:06.070
of a land-trust deed, anyway?

06:06.437 --> 06:08.159
Next to Carter Eastland,

06:08.160 --> 06:11.694
Thomas Freeman is the largest
landholder on the Reef.

06:11.695 --> 06:13.930
He's proposing to donate a
large portion of that land

06:13.931 --> 06:15.936
to become Freeman Park

06:15.937 --> 06:18.801
in exchange for an
extensive tax deduction.

06:19.019 --> 06:20.491
Mm.

06:20.492 --> 06:22.791
But if his proposal is
based on a phony appraisal,

06:22.792 --> 06:24.241
he's cheating the people with one hand

06:24.242 --> 06:25.608
while gifting them with the other.

06:26.108 --> 06:27.382
We can't have that.

06:27.383 --> 06:28.965
- So...
- Your quid pro quo...

06:28.966 --> 06:30.514
- Yep.
- ...keys to the Governor's Lodge

06:30.515 --> 06:33.917
on Wood Mountain with
unimpeded views of the volcano.

06:33.918 --> 06:35.218
Yours all weekend.

06:35.219 --> 06:37.444
Yes! And what about my money?

06:37.445 --> 06:39.456
It's been transferred to your account.

06:39.457 --> 06:40.640
Excellent.

06:40.890 --> 06:42.201
Nice doing business with you.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.366
Mm-hmm.

06:53.419 --> 06:54.500
There you go.

07:02.544 --> 07:05.280
Thank you.

07:05.281 --> 07:07.683
Here you go. Enjoy.

07:15.655 --> 07:17.157
Buy a cold drink from you?

07:17.158 --> 07:19.727
Why? They refuse you
service across the street?

07:19.728 --> 07:21.795
I support independent entrepreneurs.

07:21.796 --> 07:23.699
I may be young, but I'm not stupid.

07:23.700 --> 07:26.568
Whatever your hustle is,
take it somewhere else.

07:28.042 --> 07:30.670
What are you moving, Adderall?

07:30.671 --> 07:32.380
Yeah, SATs this Saturday.

07:32.381 --> 07:33.692
Those kids need to concentrate.

07:33.693 --> 07:34.786
They don't have rich parents

07:34.787 --> 07:36.549
who can bribe them into fancy colleges.

07:36.550 --> 07:37.785
Look at you,

07:37.786 --> 07:39.861
the little Social Justice Warrior,

07:39.862 --> 07:42.100
leveling the playing
field one dose at a time.

07:42.101 --> 07:43.865
Are you done having fun at my expense?

07:43.866 --> 07:45.514
Just starting... I hope.

07:45.515 --> 07:47.656
We're always looking for fresh blood.

07:48.182 --> 07:50.616
And we'll clear 10
times this by lunchtime.

07:52.628 --> 07:53.862
I'm Luke, by the way.

07:53.863 --> 07:55.130
Yeah, I know who you are.

07:55.131 --> 07:58.116
Think you're ready, just
walk across the street.

08:04.241 --> 08:05.740
He called himself Luke?

08:05.741 --> 08:07.509
Yep.

08:07.510 --> 08:09.243
Hangs out on Bay Street?

08:09.244 --> 08:10.310
Mm-hmm.

08:10.663 --> 08:12.436
Stay away from him.

08:12.679 --> 08:14.131
You always say that.

08:14.132 --> 08:15.415
And you never listen.

08:15.924 --> 08:17.668
I'm not a kid anymore.

08:17.669 --> 08:19.069
Bye, Otter.

08:21.237 --> 08:24.080
You notice how the whole
world wishes they were a kid,

08:24.081 --> 08:26.127
except kids like you?!

08:31.599 --> 08:33.096
Morning.

08:38.907 --> 08:40.206
Cup of coffee?

08:40.207 --> 08:41.674
Uh, sure.

08:42.677 --> 08:44.244
Hey, I hear there's a big raid planned

08:44.245 --> 08:45.878
for tonight at the Island Club.

08:46.112 --> 08:47.531
Two sugars, no cream?

08:47.532 --> 08:48.998
Yeah, thanks.

08:50.351 --> 08:51.851
So...

08:52.569 --> 08:53.770
there's a C.I. involved.

08:53.771 --> 08:54.932
Squeezed out of his nightclub

08:54.933 --> 08:57.033
by what's left of the O'Casey family.

08:57.942 --> 09:00.363
This detail, it's a mix of squads...

09:00.364 --> 09:02.128
Detective, Vice, Tech.

09:02.129 --> 09:04.130
It requires a lot of coordination,

09:04.131 --> 09:06.066
and TJ needs a
Detective-level supervisor

09:06.067 --> 09:07.832
with her on this.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.877
So Tolan gets to take the door with you,

09:11.878 --> 09:13.651
and I'm stuck here holding TJ's hand?

09:13.652 --> 09:15.875
This isn't personal in
any way, shape, or form.

09:15.876 --> 09:17.111
I want to make that clear.

09:17.112 --> 09:18.779
And if you left me off
the detail entirely,

09:18.780 --> 09:21.013
it might look that way.

09:22.966 --> 09:25.111
Thanks for understanding.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.607
So, "Luke"...

09:49.074 --> 09:50.541
what's the deal?

09:50.941 --> 09:53.177
A week's pay for 15 minutes' work.

09:53.511 --> 09:55.948
How does that sound, Warrior Girl?

10:02.689 --> 10:04.423
Aah!

10:04.424 --> 10:06.492
Hey! Get out of the way!

10:06.493 --> 10:09.061
Yo, Tony Hawk! Move your ass!

10:16.769 --> 10:18.205
- Yo!
- Come on.

10:18.206 --> 10:19.336
Get up. Move.

10:19.337 --> 10:20.711
Come on!

10:20.712 --> 10:22.967
Pick her up and move her
yourself if you have to.

10:22.968 --> 10:24.201
Yo!

10:25.684 --> 10:27.317
Don't move!

10:30.008 --> 10:32.310
Yo, yo! Chill, chill!

10:32.311 --> 10:33.519
Aah!

10:37.723 --> 10:39.823
No, you can't go!

10:43.896 --> 10:45.317
Aah!

10:49.935 --> 10:52.470
You got no idea what you just did.

10:52.471 --> 10:53.937
Put her in the car.

11:14.816 --> 11:16.182
Hello?

11:16.183 --> 11:18.675
Hey, Cat. It's Regina. Remember me?

11:18.996 --> 11:21.798
Uh, Regina O'Casey?

11:21.799 --> 11:24.567
Doug's little sister?
Yeah, I remember you.

11:24.568 --> 11:26.735
It's been a minute, huh?

11:27.245 --> 11:29.713
Want to say hi to your little pal Petra?

11:29.714 --> 11:31.393
Petra's with you?

11:31.394 --> 11:32.930
Uh, you know what, Regina?

11:32.931 --> 11:34.711
I don't really want to say hi to Petra.

11:34.712 --> 11:38.049
We're... We're taking a break
from each other for a while.

11:38.050 --> 11:40.750
Ugh. That's bad timing, Cat,

11:40.751 --> 11:42.641
because she helped
steal something of mine,

11:42.642 --> 11:44.293
and if you don't get it back,

11:44.822 --> 11:49.059
let's just say I can't
guarantee the kid's safety.

11:57.036 --> 11:58.932
Uh...

12:05.188 --> 12:07.788
You continue to be full of surprises.

12:08.043 --> 12:10.645
We had a Thai housekeeper
when I was growing up.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.016
I learned a few words from her.

12:12.017 --> 12:16.380
My parents disapproved,
so, naturally, I persisted.

12:16.381 --> 12:18.217
Ah. Well, without your persistence,

12:18.218 --> 12:20.321
we would not be opening
the largest new public park

12:20.322 --> 12:21.824
on the Reef in 50 years.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.282
Thanks to the generosity

12:23.283 --> 12:25.227
of the Freeman family and Foundation.

12:25.228 --> 12:28.071
♪ Two, no one really likes ♪

12:28.072 --> 12:31.307
Oh, I just... I got this codicil,

12:31.308 --> 12:33.616
or whatever word the tax guys use.

12:33.617 --> 12:36.354
It's Greek to me, but, apparently,

12:36.355 --> 12:38.058
they wanted to make
some small amendments

12:38.059 --> 12:39.807
to that side of things.

12:39.808 --> 12:41.331
Now?

12:41.872 --> 12:45.513
The official announcement
to the media is at 4:00.

12:45.514 --> 12:48.049
I presumed this luncheon
was some sort of celebration.

12:48.050 --> 12:49.818
The truth is, Thomas,
the Freeman fortune

12:49.819 --> 12:51.521
was built by illegally under-appraising

12:51.522 --> 12:54.115
your entire inventory,
cheating the Reef out of

12:54.116 --> 12:56.453
tens of millions of dollars in revenue.

12:56.454 --> 12:58.217
Now you've overinflated the appraisal

12:58.218 --> 13:02.213
on this donation by some
400%, according to my people.

13:02.622 --> 13:03.983
I must say, uh...

13:03.984 --> 13:05.808
The Reef taxpayers are
not gonna foot the bill

13:05.809 --> 13:07.877
for your personal extravagance.

13:15.012 --> 13:16.405
Sign over the deed,

13:16.406 --> 13:18.727
and we'll work something
out to keep you afloat.

13:23.390 --> 13:25.045
Do try these noodles.

13:25.046 --> 13:27.413
They are divine.

13:34.855 --> 13:38.946
It's Jake. Do me a favor.
Don't leave a message.

13:38.947 --> 13:41.420
Hey, Jake, it's Cat.

13:41.421 --> 13:44.903
So, uh... I'm heading out
of town for a couple days

13:44.904 --> 13:48.858
to the mountains, you know,
to clear my head, and I...

13:48.859 --> 13:50.709
I thought maybe you'd
like to come with me,

13:50.710 --> 13:53.153
see the volcano, you know?

13:53.154 --> 13:55.120
Call me back if you get this.

13:55.121 --> 13:56.848
Bye.

14:22.041 --> 14:23.829
Who are they?

14:24.345 --> 14:26.214
Just tell me who they are

14:26.215 --> 14:28.976
and how I can retrieve my merchandise,

14:28.977 --> 14:31.380
then I'll let you get
out of here in one piece.

14:31.381 --> 14:32.586
What do you say?

14:32.587 --> 14:34.056
You'd do that for me?

14:34.057 --> 14:35.823
Call me sentimental.

14:36.261 --> 14:37.560
I remember you now.

14:37.853 --> 14:40.201
Always trying to act
tough and impress Doug,

14:40.202 --> 14:42.168
but he never paid attention.

14:42.532 --> 14:44.119
Oh!

14:44.664 --> 14:46.821
Is that tough enough for you?

14:46.822 --> 14:49.013
Take her downstairs to the basement.

14:49.724 --> 14:51.691
If Cat doesn't show up by midnight,

14:52.180 --> 14:55.211
then Miss Thing here
turns into a pumpkin.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.468
Hey, you've called Otter.

15:01.469 --> 15:03.637
I'm not here. Bye.

15:03.638 --> 15:05.560
Hey, Otter.

15:05.561 --> 15:07.797
God, doesn't anyone
answer their phone anymore?

15:07.798 --> 15:09.209
It's Cat.

15:09.210 --> 15:10.511
Listen, I'm heading out of town.

15:10.512 --> 15:12.712
I need you to do me a favor.

15:13.258 --> 15:16.116
Have Doug O'Casey call me, alright?

15:21.029 --> 15:23.162
Hey, TJ. How's it going?

15:23.391 --> 15:25.097
So far, so good.

15:25.098 --> 15:27.494
I'm establishing the live
feeds to the Island Club.

15:27.495 --> 15:29.099
We'll be ready for the raid tonight.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.433
You draw short straw or something?

15:31.434 --> 15:33.044
Aw, well, Sergeant Ellis thought

15:33.045 --> 15:34.170
you needed some...

15:34.171 --> 15:36.136
adult supervision.

15:36.137 --> 15:38.106
What happened between you and Kristy?

15:38.107 --> 15:41.111
I was shipping you guys hard.

15:41.112 --> 15:42.213
You were what, now?

15:42.214 --> 15:43.426
Buddy cops.

15:43.427 --> 15:44.670
Or something more?

15:44.671 --> 15:45.896
- Okay.
- Riding together

15:45.897 --> 15:47.147
or grabbing a coffee,

15:47.148 --> 15:48.750
all "tête-à-tête" over there.

15:48.751 --> 15:50.451
TJ, Sergeant Ellis and I have

15:50.452 --> 15:52.185
a professional relationship.

15:52.186 --> 15:53.804
All goes well, they kick in the doors

15:53.805 --> 15:55.656
at the Island Club tonight.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.490
So...

15:57.491 --> 16:00.093
coffee with Sergeant Ellis tomorrow?

16:10.938 --> 16:13.100
You know how to help yourself, right?

16:13.101 --> 16:14.542
Spill your guts.

16:14.543 --> 16:16.543
Then we can both get out of this dump.

16:17.992 --> 16:21.080
Yo, junior, it's your friends or you.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.647
They're not my friends.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.132
Why'd you do it, then?

16:24.133 --> 16:26.251
I mean, what'd they promise
before they ditched you?

16:26.252 --> 16:28.187
Who said they promised me anything?

16:29.852 --> 16:32.318
Well, if you did it for nothing, then...

16:32.319 --> 16:34.161
you're dumber than you look.

16:34.376 --> 16:36.328
Maybe I did it to get
Regina's attention.

16:38.899 --> 16:40.751
What, by getting caught?

16:41.201 --> 16:42.500
Wow.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.471
You're funny.

16:45.472 --> 16:46.872
Yeah, keep laughing.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.739
I'll have your job by closing time.

17:02.102 --> 17:03.256
Aah!

17:03.257 --> 17:05.388
Petra!

17:43.394 --> 17:44.696
Hey, Red.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.099
Hello, stranger.

17:46.100 --> 17:47.197
How you doing?

17:47.198 --> 17:48.332
I'm good.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.200
Hey, you got mineral oil?

17:50.201 --> 17:51.546
Aisle 1, by the tissues.

17:51.547 --> 17:53.913
Right here.

17:56.613 --> 17:58.979
You know, you keep
moving everything, Red.

17:58.980 --> 18:00.208
I got to keep busy.

18:02.682 --> 18:05.247
Alright. And...

18:05.248 --> 18:06.982
Ah.

18:08.018 --> 18:10.500
Wow. That's a lot of peppers.

18:10.501 --> 18:12.330
- Yeah.
- So...

18:12.331 --> 18:14.673
nice Italian sub for lunch

18:14.674 --> 18:17.111
with a side order of tear gas?

18:17.112 --> 18:18.427
Yeah, well, Otter called me.

18:18.428 --> 18:21.430
We're gonna take care of some
guys with something spicy.

18:21.431 --> 18:23.366
You want a bag for those?

18:23.367 --> 18:27.613
Uh, well, if you throw in
the basket, I'll pay cash.

18:27.925 --> 18:29.071
You got it.

18:29.072 --> 18:30.772
Yay!

18:34.500 --> 18:36.407
I'm nervous.

18:37.270 --> 18:39.837
I hate talking to the media.

18:42.251 --> 18:43.950
Thomas.

18:44.692 --> 18:46.920
You're giving the
people a beautiful park.

18:47.380 --> 18:48.856
No one will care if you stumble

18:48.857 --> 18:50.690
on a line or two of your announcement.

18:51.273 --> 18:52.428
Well, thank you. I...

18:53.827 --> 18:55.462
Excuse me.

18:59.402 --> 19:00.835
Jake. Hi.

19:00.836 --> 19:02.904
Um, listen, I can't...

19:02.905 --> 19:04.305
I can't really talk right now,

19:04.306 --> 19:06.974
but I just wanted to
make sure you're okay.

19:06.975 --> 19:08.743
Never better.

19:08.744 --> 19:09.944
Is that right?

19:09.945 --> 19:12.813
Hey, I didn't see your
message... m-messages.

19:12.814 --> 19:14.448
My phone must've ran out of batteries.

19:14.449 --> 19:16.249
You sound like you've
been drinking again.

19:16.874 --> 19:19.019
Hey, it's happy hour somewhere.

19:19.249 --> 19:21.188
This is about Cat.

19:21.189 --> 19:22.752
Isn't it?

19:23.625 --> 19:26.794
Why would you even say that?

19:26.795 --> 19:28.195
Because last night when I called,

19:28.196 --> 19:29.830
I heard it in your voice.

19:29.831 --> 19:32.166
- It's time.
- I have to go.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.065
Let's see what you got.

19:40.066 --> 19:42.043
Names, dates, CVVs.

19:42.044 --> 19:44.911
Every one checks out.
Go ahead and run one.

19:51.152 --> 19:52.486
How many?

19:52.487 --> 19:56.689
Every card's solid gold...
or platinum, right?

19:59.309 --> 20:00.394
Where did these come from?

20:00.395 --> 20:01.528
What do you care?

20:01.529 --> 20:03.363
Your job is to sell it, not smell it.

20:03.364 --> 20:05.966
Regina O'Casey runs
credit cards on the Reef.

20:05.967 --> 20:08.668
So? Let's just say it fell off a truck,

20:08.669 --> 20:10.870
and we're too smart to
spit fortune in the eye.

20:11.939 --> 20:14.208
Well, if that's the case, lucky for you

20:14.209 --> 20:16.143
I already have a buyer to
take this off your hands.

20:16.144 --> 20:17.277
How much?

20:18.513 --> 20:20.747
You'll be blown away by her offer.

20:24.085 --> 20:25.819
- Aah!
- Aah!

20:28.288 --> 20:29.990
Aah! Aah!

20:29.991 --> 20:31.758
You screwed over Petra!

20:31.759 --> 20:34.460
Otter, show these boys what happens

20:34.461 --> 20:36.229
when you mess with our girl.

20:47.441 --> 20:49.175
You want one?

20:49.176 --> 20:50.844
- No.
- Or some food?

20:50.845 --> 20:53.579
I-I could get you a sandwich
from the kitchen or something.

20:53.580 --> 20:55.882
It's 'cause you're young, right?

20:55.883 --> 21:00.385
That's why you get the crap details.

21:00.386 --> 21:04.589
You know, I-I see you
trying so hard to be bad.

21:04.590 --> 21:06.525
I remember what it was like at your age.

21:07.961 --> 21:09.728
Yeah, well, when I'm your age,

21:09.729 --> 21:12.429
I won't be the loser who
gets stuck in the basement.

21:15.035 --> 21:18.971
Well, at the rate you're
going, you'll never be my age.

21:44.630 --> 21:48.300
It's Jake. Do me a favor.
Don't leave a message.

21:48.301 --> 21:50.535
Jake, where are you?

21:50.536 --> 21:52.504
It's me again. Listen, change in plans.

21:52.505 --> 21:53.938
I'm not going to the volcano.

21:53.939 --> 21:56.640
I'm at the Island Club,
and I need your help.

21:56.641 --> 21:58.600
Call me back.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.246
Jake.

22:02.247 --> 22:03.815
Sorry. Wrong number.

22:03.816 --> 22:05.083
Doug O'Casey.

22:05.084 --> 22:06.918
I see you got my message.

22:06.919 --> 22:08.319
It made my day.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.454
You know, one call
from you to your sister

22:10.455 --> 22:11.956
could end all of this.

22:11.957 --> 22:13.224
My sister?

22:13.225 --> 22:14.726
She's a pain in the ass.

22:14.727 --> 22:18.596
Why did you bother calling me
if you're not gonna help me, hmm?

22:18.597 --> 22:22.466
Well... here I am
lying in my lonely cell,

22:22.467 --> 22:25.469
surrounded by foul-smelling, noisy man.

22:26.605 --> 22:28.572
Take me away from here, Cat.

22:28.573 --> 22:31.474
I need to relax before I can
figure out how to help you.

22:31.475 --> 22:33.476
What am I, a phone-sex operator?

22:33.477 --> 22:35.212
I'm a little busy right now.

22:35.213 --> 22:38.048
Yeah, well, I've got all
the time in the world.

22:38.049 --> 22:41.952
Yeah? Well, thanks to
your sister, I don't.

22:57.357 --> 22:58.892
Thank you, Governor.

22:59.645 --> 23:02.037
Yes, I-I think it's a
very good deal for us

23:02.038 --> 23:03.772
and the taxpayers.

23:04.874 --> 23:06.975
Thank you, sir. That means a lot.

23:06.976 --> 23:09.144
Okay.

23:09.145 --> 23:10.846
Hey, Thomas.

23:10.847 --> 23:12.480
Yeah, I'm just outside now.

23:13.616 --> 23:15.250
I can't wait either.

23:15.251 --> 23:16.584
Okay.

23:16.585 --> 23:17.853
Stay close, Eddie.

23:17.854 --> 23:20.055
One drink, and I'm out.

23:30.900 --> 23:32.234
Whoa.

23:32.235 --> 23:33.567
Hey, it's Cat Chambers.

23:33.568 --> 23:35.769
Tell Regina I'm here.

23:35.770 --> 23:37.338
Hey, look at this.

23:37.339 --> 23:39.572
Why is Cat Chambers at the Island Club?

23:45.613 --> 23:47.248
What is she doing here?

23:47.249 --> 23:49.317
Do our guys know she's in the building?

23:49.318 --> 23:51.517
I don't... think so.

23:56.691 --> 23:57.925
Were the cards delivered?

23:57.926 --> 24:00.294
As soon as I get confirmation
from our man inside.

24:02.530 --> 24:03.965
Why is she here?

24:03.966 --> 24:04.966
No idea.

24:04.967 --> 24:06.767
Find out... now.

24:06.768 --> 24:08.002
On it.

24:13.807 --> 24:15.608
Regina.

24:15.609 --> 24:17.143
Long time, no see.

24:17.144 --> 24:19.179
Good. You've got my package.

24:19.180 --> 24:20.280
Give it to him.

24:20.281 --> 24:22.315
Sure.

24:22.316 --> 24:23.983
You look good, Regina.

24:27.054 --> 24:28.621
Oops.

24:28.622 --> 24:29.990
Dish towels?

24:29.991 --> 24:31.758
Oh, you trying to play me.

24:31.759 --> 24:34.594
Why can't you ever make
anything nice and easy?

24:34.595 --> 24:37.463
Did you really think I
was gonna walk in here

24:37.464 --> 24:40.367
and just hand over the
goods, give up my leverage?

24:40.368 --> 24:43.336
I want you to bring Petra
in here, let me see her,

24:43.337 --> 24:45.772
and then you can have
your cards back, okay?

24:47.041 --> 24:49.542
I actually have a better idea.

24:55.749 --> 24:58.784
Kill her now.

25:01.121 --> 25:02.254
Oh, come on.

25:02.255 --> 25:03.523
You know me better than that.

25:03.524 --> 25:05.257
I know a bluff when I see one.

25:05.258 --> 25:07.794
Your brother, Doug,
would never let you touch

25:07.795 --> 25:09.962
a hair on Petra's head.

25:09.963 --> 25:11.431
It's always Doug.

25:11.432 --> 25:13.332
People throw his name
at me like a knife,

25:13.333 --> 25:14.967
but I pay the bills here now.

25:14.968 --> 25:17.169
The good news is you'll
be right down the street

25:17.170 --> 25:19.672
from him at the women's
maximum-security prison

25:19.673 --> 25:22.642
if you're dumb enough to kill a minor

25:22.643 --> 25:24.744
over 50 grand worth of credit cards.

25:24.745 --> 25:26.512
I mean, come on, Regina.

25:26.513 --> 25:27.947
This is small time.

25:27.948 --> 25:30.950
So when I see my brother, I'll be asking

25:30.951 --> 25:33.018
for his forgiveness, not his permission,

25:33.019 --> 25:34.886
if I don't get my freaking cards back.

25:34.887 --> 25:36.155
Okay.

25:36.156 --> 25:37.589
Bring Petra in here.

25:37.590 --> 25:38.924
I'll make my call.

25:38.925 --> 25:40.326
I'll get you your cards.

25:40.327 --> 25:41.360
That simple.

25:41.361 --> 25:42.860
Alright?

25:45.131 --> 25:46.730
Bring her in here.

25:50.003 --> 25:52.771
I need to go to the bathroom.

25:52.772 --> 25:55.374
There's no way you're leaving
this room until she says so.

25:55.375 --> 25:58.844
Are you serious? You're
gonna make me go right here?

26:09.388 --> 26:12.657
Don't do anything stupid
and make me beat your ass.

26:17.162 --> 26:19.564
Over there.

26:19.565 --> 26:20.699
What, in a bucket?

26:20.700 --> 26:23.066

Ellis assigned me here.

whatever's coming?

33:51.434 --> 33:53.602

33:53.603 --> 33:56.605
I want you to wait in the
car for me for a minute, okay?

34:23.565 --> 34:26.900
Somewhere I haven't
been in a long while.

34:26.902 --> 34:29.670
I'm just trying to figure
out what to do about it.

34:29.670 --> 34:32.172
Is this about what happened last night?

34:35.978 --> 34:38.312
Good night, Cat.

34:42.518 --> 34:44.585
Good night.

35:10.561 --> 35:11.646
I know I messed up.

35:11.647 --> 35:12.847
Yeah, you did.

35:12.848 --> 35:14.481
Yeah, well, next time, I'll be smarter.

35:14.482 --> 35:15.650
Next time?

35:15.651 --> 35:17.384
Oh, there's gonna be a next time.

35:17.385 --> 35:19.020
Yeah.

35:19.021 --> 35:21.321
My dad was Shorepound
Gang. It's in my blood.

35:21.322 --> 35:24.358
Okay, you know, I was
Shorepound Gang, and I got out.

35:24.359 --> 35:26.894
This whole "it's in my
blood" thing is a story

35:26.895 --> 35:29.063
you've been telling yourself for so long

35:29.064 --> 35:30.730
you're actually starting to believe it.

35:30.731 --> 35:31.731
Stop, okay?

35:31.732 --> 35:33.633
No, I won't stop. You know why?

35:33.634 --> 35:37.303
Because I care that you
make choices that are smart.

35:37.304 --> 35:41.041
I don't want you doing something
you can never escape from.

35:41.042 --> 35:43.143
It's not a choice.

35:43.144 --> 35:44.510
It's who I am.

35:44.511 --> 35:45.979
You're 17 years old.

35:45.980 --> 35:48.314
Who you are right now is just dumb.

35:48.315 --> 35:50.050
No offense.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.734
You're a tough one to figure out.

36:08.735 --> 36:11.769
Ah. Well, that's exactly what
my mom always used to say.

36:14.575 --> 36:17.176
Whatever you think's going on here,

36:17.177 --> 36:19.512
it does not justify you
being out of protocol.

36:19.513 --> 36:22.481
There were people with guns
and bad intentions at that club.

36:22.482 --> 36:24.550
Cutting the juice maybe saved lives.

36:24.551 --> 36:25.651
Maybe.

36:25.652 --> 36:27.087
Isn't that why you
gave me this assignment

36:27.088 --> 36:29.455
in the first place...
you know, supervise TJ

36:29.456 --> 36:31.224
so I could make that
kind of judgment call?

36:31.225 --> 36:32.791
Okay.

36:32.792 --> 36:34.594
But this Cat Chambers connection,

36:34.595 --> 36:36.962
whatever you tell yourself about it,

36:36.963 --> 36:38.598

thinking, and, um...

37:47.298 --> 37:48.965
... you were right.

37:48.966 --> 37:52.269
Maybe... now's not the right time

37:52.270 --> 37:54.670
to let people know about us.

37:56.740 --> 38:01.678
We'd be, um, opening ourselves
up to a lot of scrutiny.

38:01.679 --> 38:04.681
Yeah, yeah, and, um...

38:04.682 --> 38:07.716

we got a good thing going.

38:35.512 --> 38:37.347

38:37.348 --> 38:39.482
It's offshore and barreling.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.651

and hit it, what do you say?

38:41.652 --> 38:42.678
Come on.

38:42.679 --> 38:44.887
No, I'm really tired today.

38:44.888 --> 38:46.656

38:46.657 --> 38:48.057
Oh, come on.

38:48.058 --> 38:50.760
The ocean always makes
us feel better, right?

38:50.761 --> 38:54.295
You're just, uh, one surf
away from a good mood.

38:54.296 --> 38:56.398
That's what I like to say.

38:56.399 --> 38:57.599
Come on.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.068
Let's just get in the ocean.
We'll wash it all away.

39:00.069 --> 39:02.136
It's easy. You'll feel better.

39:02.137 --> 39:06.307
You know, I really miss my dad...

39:06.308 --> 39:09.644
every single day.

39:09.645 --> 39:11.979
And nothing can wash that away.

39:13.383 --> 39:16.451
I know that, Petra, and I...

39:16.452 --> 39:20.054
I feel...

39:20.055 --> 39:21.289
responsible.

39:21.290 --> 39:22.924
And I'm sorry.

39:22.925 --> 39:25.826
I won't stop trying
to make things better

39:25.827 --> 39:27.695

39:27.696 --> 39:31.899
No matter how hard you
push me away, I'm here.

39:31.900 --> 39:34.000
I'm not going anywhere.

39:36.520 --> 39:37.605
Let's go in the water.

39:37.606 --> 39:38.863
We'll just... We'll go for a surf.

39:38.864 --> 39:40.007
You'll feel better.
