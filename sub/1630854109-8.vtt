Aah!

01:04.998 --> 01:05.899
Hey.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.968
Hey, Kai Holman.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.837
Long time.

01:09.937 --> 01:10.838
Yeah.

01:10.938 --> 01:11.939
What you doing, brah?

01:12.039 --> 01:13.574
Ah, just here for
the grindz, Tran.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.709
Your pops know you come
across the street for some food?

01:15.809 --> 01:17.445
Yeah, it'll be our secret.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.447
Hey, your loco moco's coming up.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.081
All right.

01:21.182 --> 01:24.318
Hey, I, uh... Man, I heard
Margaux's closed up last week.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.619
Yeah, it's a real shame.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.855
It's hard to stay
open these days, huh?

01:27.955 --> 01:29.123
People got no money.

01:29.223 --> 01:31.659
But <i>ho'omau.</i>
We do what we got to.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.395
Is that a new
espresso machine?

01:34.495 --> 01:36.063
Uh, yes, it is.

01:36.164 --> 01:38.999
Ah. Are you selling a lot
of lattes these days?

01:39.099 --> 01:41.335
Uh, makes the tourists
feel like it's "home."

01:41.435 --> 01:43.371
Yeah, I tried to get
Pop to install one.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.273
Banned me from
the restaurant for a week.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.274
They're pricey.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.308
Well, tell me about it.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.177
But business is good, so...

01:49.277 --> 01:50.511
Yep.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.047
Is it?

01:54.148 --> 01:55.249
Well, usually.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.251
You know, I made
some upgrades.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.252
A brand-new kitchen.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.920
Right on.

02:00.988 --> 02:02.089
Oh. Thank you.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.525
Oh.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.461
I got to run.

02:09.563 --> 02:10.731
Mahalo for the moco.

02:10.831 --> 02:11.865
Yeah you.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.242
Here you go.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.810
Good boy.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.589
Don't get many calls
to the theater.

02:35.689 --> 02:38.459
Well, there's not much of
a drama scene on the island.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.361
Unless you count
school plays.

02:40.461 --> 02:41.595
I don't.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.264
Gracie was in a play
in the fifth grade.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.065
Man, it was brutal.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.636
The elementary production
not up to your standards?

02:48.736 --> 02:49.770
You know, these kids,

02:49.870 --> 02:51.772
they just refuse
to live truthfully

02:51.872 --> 02:54.975
under imaginary circumstances.

02:55.075 --> 02:55.976
You don't say.

02:56.076 --> 02:58.312
Who's our victim?

02:58.412 --> 03:01.148
Petty Officer Second Class
Kendall Wells.

03:01.249 --> 03:04.051
Navy weatherman.

03:04.151 --> 03:06.454
Who moonlights as a
musketeer in the chorus?

03:06.554 --> 03:08.155
Pirate King, actually.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.757
Sorry, what's that now?

03:09.857 --> 03:11.859
He's the Pirate King.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.262
In the show? Second male lead?

03:15.263 --> 03:17.265
Sorry, you just seem
to know a lot about this.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.132
<i>Pirates of Penzance.</i>

03:19.233 --> 03:22.403
I should, I once played
the Pirate King myself.

03:22.503 --> 03:23.771
In high school?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.906
No, dude, in college.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.975
Oh.

03:28.075 --> 03:28.909
Okay, Pirate King.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.844
So, this guy was supposed

03:30.944 --> 03:32.079
to make an entrance, right?

03:32.179 --> 03:33.781
And then he falls
during the finale?

03:33.881 --> 03:35.583
Well, this happened
early in the first act.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.285
So, no, not
the finale.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.786
But, yeah, you got
the rest right.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.121
It appears he was strangled
by one of the fly wires.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.924
Which explains the ligature
marks around his neck.

03:44.024 --> 03:47.528
But not the defensive
wounds on his hands.

03:47.628 --> 03:48.962
He got into a confrontation.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.097
Yeah.

03:50.197 --> 03:52.933
Who was onstage
when it happened?

03:53.033 --> 03:55.135
The five sisters,

03:55.235 --> 03:58.205
Frederic, and Emma Rose,
who plays Mabel.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.041
Pirate Queen?

04:01.141 --> 04:04.445
No, just stop. You're
embarrassing yourself.

04:05.212 --> 04:09.116
It was opening weekend
and everyone was so excited.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.985
And then the dream turned
into a nightmare.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.188
You have any idea why
Kendall was in the rafters?

04:15.289 --> 04:17.825
No, he was supposed to be
offstage for his entrance.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.159
Nobody goes up there.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.227
It's a safety hazard.

04:20.328 --> 04:22.229
How well did you know Kendall?

04:23.130 --> 04:25.098
We've done a couple shows together.

04:25.198 --> 04:27.267
H-he was pretty new
to the acting thing,

04:27.368 --> 04:29.102
being in the Navy and all.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.871
But he was good.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.874
Did you notice anything
off about him lately?

04:33.974 --> 04:35.242
Yeah, he was way off.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.545
He started showing up late
to rehearsals.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.012
And then said
he couldn't help it

04:39.112 --> 04:41.715
because of a secret project
he was working on.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.284
Well, what kind
of secret project?

04:44.385 --> 04:47.588
A movie, I think. Something big.

04:47.688 --> 04:48.956
Yeah? Like a movie movie?

04:49.757 --> 04:52.059
He wouldn't say,
but we all had our theories.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.728
Why wouldn't he talk
about a movie he's in?

04:54.828 --> 04:55.896
Well, these big features,
they make you sign

04:55.996 --> 04:57.765
nondisclosure agreements.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.232
Or so I hear.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.068
Anyway, I'm pretty sure
I know what it was.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.302
And what's that?

05:03.337 --> 05:04.838
Three initials.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.173
MCU.

05:06.273 --> 05:10.210
Okay, so what does
MCU stand for?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.179
Marvel something
something?

05:12.279 --> 05:14.648
All right, well, it's fair
to say that Petty Officer Wells

05:14.748 --> 05:18.185
wasn't killed over
a superhero movie.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.286
'Cause he wasn't in one.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.421
I checked with his CO.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.922
Wells was a low-level
weatherman.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.425
Performed minor maintenance,
weather forecasts,

05:24.525 --> 05:26.093
and the occasional
light opera.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.829
None of which
lead to murder.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.599
Except Wells did have
a top secret clearance.

05:31.699 --> 05:32.866
As a weather technician?

05:32.966 --> 05:34.368
No. As something else.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.336
But his CO was told
it was a need-to-know only,

05:36.437 --> 05:37.838
and he didn't need to know.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.540
Okay, well, we need to know.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.574
So I'll get us read in.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.509
Yeah.

05:41.609 --> 05:42.810
Uh, can I help you?

05:44.578 --> 05:45.679
Special Agent Boone.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.416
Dang. I was hoping
to surprise you.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.450
You did, Alan.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.051
By messing with my stuff.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.854
Sorry. I saw these files
weren't alphabetized

05:53.954 --> 05:56.256
or really organized
in any conceivable way.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.191
I have a system, okay?

05:58.291 --> 05:59.893
Then again, no one really
uses physical files anymore.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.495
I can digitize them for you.

06:01.595 --> 06:04.932
Or you can not do that, too.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.300
Just want to make the most
of my time on the team.

06:09.503 --> 06:10.571
On the what now?

06:10.671 --> 06:12.673
Alan is filling
in for Lucy

06:12.773 --> 06:14.742
while she is Agent Afloat.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.344
Temporarily.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.580
Really?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.515
I know. I was shocked, too.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.983
Being invited to the A-Team?

06:23.083 --> 06:24.284
Yeah, okay, well,
first rule of the A-Team:

06:24.384 --> 06:27.054
we don't touch
each other's stuff.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.490
Copy.

06:29.590 --> 06:30.491
Any other rules?

06:30.591 --> 06:32.025
Yeah, there's a ton.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.595
But I got to go see Commander
Chase about an autopsy.

06:34.695 --> 06:37.865
No, sir, you do not.
I spoke with her.

06:38.666 --> 06:39.433
Okay.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.868
What'd she say?

06:40.968 --> 06:44.004
Oh, she was very kind.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.574
Could tell I was nervous
about being around

06:46.674 --> 06:47.908
a dead body for
the first time.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.810
She suggested
celestite and amethyst.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.312
About the victim, Alan.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.380
Oh, right. The victim.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.748
He had burn marks on his body

06:54.848 --> 06:56.884
from a cattle prod
or a stun gun.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.119
Or some other electrical
shocking instrument.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.354
So he was tortured
before he was murdered?

07:05.025 --> 07:06.460
Ernie's got something
on Petty Officer Wells.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.495
I'll go.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.029
No. I'll send Kai.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.264
Let Alan talk you through

07:11.364 --> 07:13.366
the rest of Commander Chase's
observations.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.970
Fun.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.242
What do you got, Ernie?

07:22.342 --> 07:24.111
♪ A paradox, a paradox ♪

07:24.211 --> 07:26.246
♪ A most ingenious paradox ♪

07:27.014 --> 07:28.248
Am I supposed to know
what that means?

07:29.517 --> 07:30.951
Come on. Really?

07:31.051 --> 07:32.419
<i>Pirates of Penzance.</i>

07:32.520 --> 07:33.987
♪ We've quips and quibbles
heard in flocks ♪

07:34.087 --> 07:36.624
♪ But none to beat
this paradox. ♪

07:36.724 --> 07:39.192
Still nothing.
What?

07:39.292 --> 07:42.596
I'm a lifelong member of the
Gilbert Sullivan Society.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.031
Well, seems to be an epidemic.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.499
But does any of this have to do

07:45.599 --> 07:46.767
with Kendall Wells' murder?

07:46.867 --> 07:49.102
Yes. I'm not sure
what Wells was into,

07:49.202 --> 07:50.571
but I know where he's been.

07:50.671 --> 07:51.672
Well, sort of.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.340
According to his
cell phone GPS,

07:53.440 --> 07:55.475
Wells made regular visits
over the last few weeks

07:55.576 --> 07:57.645
to a particular
location on the island.

07:57.745 --> 07:58.912
And where is that?

07:59.012 --> 08:01.682
That's the paradox.
It doesn't exist.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.851
Just a big blank spot
on the island.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.855
Kunia Regional SIGINT
Operations Center.

08:07.955 --> 08:10.023
It's "The Hole."

08:10.123 --> 08:12.660
So top secret
it can't even be mapped.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.128
But what business would our
singing weatherman have there?

08:15.228 --> 08:17.430
There's only
one way to find out.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.403
This is it?

08:23.503 --> 08:25.505
Right coordinates.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.080
Doesn't seem
all that secure.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.182
Gate's no longer locked,

08:35.282 --> 08:37.851
old-school cameras
with the wires hanging loose.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.854
Yeah, if this was
a military installation...

08:40.954 --> 08:41.955
There should be
more military.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.190
Let's check it out.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.925
Alan, why don't you
stay back and...

08:45.025 --> 08:47.060
What are you doing?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.095
We're back in the field.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.129
Anything can happen.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.698
Got to be prepared.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.132
Prepared for...?

08:52.232 --> 08:54.167
When the hammer falls.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.570
Like last time.
I got taken hostage.

08:56.670 --> 08:57.771
For two minutes.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.873
By a friendly agent
with a cell phone.

09:00.641 --> 09:01.742
I didn't know that at the time.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.276
Sure.

09:03.376 --> 09:07.080
But you've been in the
field since then, right?

09:07.180 --> 09:08.548
You mean other
than today?

09:08.649 --> 09:11.018
What have you been doing
for the last year?

09:11.118 --> 09:12.820
Uh, a stint in economic crime,

09:12.920 --> 09:16.624
then fraud and back to FLETC for
a digital evidence intensive.

09:16.724 --> 09:20.761
All right. Well, second rule
of being on the A-Team:

09:20.861 --> 09:21.829
Most of
the time,

09:21.929 --> 09:23.163
nothing happens,

09:23.263 --> 09:24.264
so you don't...

09:24.364 --> 09:25.866
So much for
nothing happening.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.334
Stay there, Alan!

09:33.674 --> 09:34.642
Federal agents!

09:34.742 --> 09:35.976
Put your guns down!

09:38.946 --> 09:40.914
Cut!

09:42.883 --> 09:44.484
What the hell is this?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.987
This is truly screwing
up my timeline.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.256
You have a warrant
for interrupting my movie?

09:58.565 --> 09:59.700
What exactly do
you do here?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.268
We're the media arm
for the government.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.303
Film top secret training videos.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.105
That's what we walked into?

10:05.205 --> 10:06.273
The lethal defense
portion of

10:06.373 --> 10:07.607
our force continuum
training series.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.376
It's, uh, it's been
pretty important.

10:09.476 --> 10:13.446
Was Petty Officer Kendall Wells
involved in this, uh, series?

10:13.546 --> 10:16.083
Kenny? No. Why do you ask?

10:17.150 --> 10:19.052
He was killed yesterday.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.222
Oh, my God.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.423
But he did work here?

10:23.523 --> 10:24.992
One of our regulars.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.894
Always on time.
Always committed.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.496
What's required to participate
in these videos?

10:29.596 --> 10:32.432
Our screening process
is thorough.

10:32.532 --> 10:33.633
Actors need top secret clearance,

10:33.734 --> 10:35.068
impeccable background,

10:35.168 --> 10:36.837
doesn't hurt to have
some acting experience.

10:36.937 --> 10:40.040
I think we found your people,
Pirate King.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.777
What happened to Kenny?

10:43.877 --> 10:45.345
No, we can't go into
too many details,

10:45.445 --> 10:47.748
but it's possible that
Petty Officer Wells was killed

10:47.848 --> 10:49.649
for something
he learned here.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.018
I can't imagine
that's the case.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.753
Actors are siloed
while they're filming.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.755
They only have
access to their scenes.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.123
Usually don't
have enough info

10:56.223 --> 10:58.091
to threaten
national security.
"Usually"?

10:58.191 --> 11:01.695
Well, like my mama said,
anything's possible.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.798
How many productions
was Wells in?

11:04.898 --> 11:06.666
Dozens probably.
Been at it a couple of years.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.001
We're going
to need a list

11:08.101 --> 11:09.837
of every actor who
participated in them

11:09.937 --> 11:11.772
and access to the
training videos.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.173
Well, that's above
my pay grade,

11:13.273 --> 11:15.876
but I'll put you in touch
with my bosses.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.146
Perimeter's secure.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.348
I'll do another pass
just to make sure.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.751
Alan, it's okay.
Stand down.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.753
Okay.

11:29.489 --> 11:30.758
Hey.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.425
Just been read
into the training program.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.862
Videos, crew lists and actor
contacts are being sent over.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.564
Great. Let me know
when they're here. Okay.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.503
Everything all right?
Yeah.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.472
Yep, everything's all right.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.710
Hey, I, um...

11:50.811 --> 11:52.145
I've been working
on something off-hours

11:52.245 --> 11:53.981
that I'd like to talk
to you about.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.949
Okay.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.184
Go for it.

11:58.952 --> 12:02.122
So, I have been looking into
the Koa brothers' operation.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.624
The Koa brothers
were killed in prison.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.093
And we took down
their operation.

12:06.193 --> 12:09.129
That is half right.
Yeah, they're dead, but...

12:09.229 --> 12:11.631
I think the operation
is still being run.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.202
By AJ Hale.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.304
Your friend who worked for them?

12:17.404 --> 12:18.538
Yep.

12:18.638 --> 12:19.940
He did more
than just work for them.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.175
I think he set up
their whole financial structure.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.944
Buying into local businesses

12:24.044 --> 12:26.713
and then funneling cash
through them to launder it.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.917
Now, I have been
looking at these places--

12:30.017 --> 12:33.653
restaurants,
a funeral home, bait store.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.188
All have face-lifts.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.489
New equipment,
new designs.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.192
And there's no way
the owners can afford it.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.429
So, you think AJ
is giving them money?

12:42.529 --> 12:45.532
And then he's cleaning his.
He's acting like a savior.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.167
A man of the people, but it's...

12:47.267 --> 12:48.936
it's just a racket.

12:49.036 --> 12:52.239
Well, if that's true, this
has RICO written all over it.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.740
I know, right?

12:53.841 --> 12:55.775
I don't see a Navy nexus.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.410
This is not our jurisdiction.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.079
Not-not technically...

12:59.179 --> 13:00.247
Not at all.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.482
This is FBI.

13:02.582 --> 13:03.750
I understand that, but...

13:03.851 --> 13:06.119
This is also way
too personal for you.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.922
Conflict of interest.
It is personal.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.824
It's personal because we're
letting him get away with it.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.125
We should've taken him down

13:12.225 --> 13:13.961
when we had the chance
with the Koas.

13:14.061 --> 13:17.264
It's personal because he is
a childhood friend of yours.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.232
Refer this to Whistler.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.534
See if you can
get her to buy in.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.904
Then walk away.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.741
All right, I'll reach out
to Whistler.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.215
What are we
looking at here?

13:35.315 --> 13:39.219
United States Navy
training video 423-DN7.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.889
"Principles of Ordnance
Maintenance, Part Two."

13:41.989 --> 13:44.724
A little hard to follow
without the context of part one.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.059
Fire in the hole!

13:47.627 --> 13:48.929
How many are there?

13:49.029 --> 13:50.730
Dozens. Alan's going
through them as we speak.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.732
He'll flag anything
that's more sensitive than

13:52.832 --> 13:55.602
"proper storage
of blasting caps."

13:55.702 --> 13:56.970
How long is that gonna take?

13:57.070 --> 13:58.271
A while.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.673
Which helps solve
the Alan problem.

14:00.773 --> 14:02.642
Dude. Be nice.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.211
Look, unless we can find
a way to narrow down

14:04.311 --> 14:06.779
what we're looking for,
it's the best lead we got.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.281
Think I have a workaround.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.417
I've been scouring

14:10.517 --> 14:12.319
the cast lists from
the videos Wells was in.

14:12.419 --> 14:16.023
And I found Army Warrant Officer
Angela Pettis.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.625
What's special about her?

14:18.725 --> 14:19.759
She was killed in a hit-and-run

14:19.859 --> 14:21.528
two days ago in San Diego.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.297
Locals got any leads?
No, but her autopsy

14:24.397 --> 14:26.499
also came up with
some sort of burn marks

14:26.599 --> 14:29.269
from a stun gun
or a cattle prod.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.173
Pettis and Wells
were tortured the same way.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.209
How many videos
were they in together?

14:36.309 --> 14:38.645
Uh, just one.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.413
What's this?
In the control room,

14:40.513 --> 14:42.582
at the top of each server rack,
you'll find a thermite grenade.

14:42.682 --> 14:43.750
Thermite grenade...

14:43.850 --> 14:44.851
Petty Officer Wells

14:44.952 --> 14:46.119
demonstrating a burn switch.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.055
Designed to self-detonate
upon activation.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.690
A defense measure
in safe houses.

14:50.790 --> 14:51.724
That's what this whole
video is about.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.026
Safe house protocols.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.195
Someone's going after
safe house intel.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.798
What did Pettis
and Wells actually know?

14:58.898 --> 14:59.899
Not much. They hit
a few buttons,

15:00.000 --> 15:01.168
demonstrate what
to do in case of

15:01.268 --> 15:03.536
breach or fire,
but nothing else.

15:03.636 --> 15:04.972
So why torture them?

15:05.072 --> 15:07.007
Might not be what
they know but who.

15:08.841 --> 15:11.244
We should find the director
of this training video.

15:12.479 --> 15:13.680
Lennox Kay.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.815
Former Air Force,
current freelance director

15:15.915 --> 15:18.118
and producer for the DoD.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.686
Where is he now?

15:19.786 --> 15:21.388
Lives here on Oahu.

15:29.562 --> 15:30.630
Front door's open.

15:30.730 --> 15:31.631
Jesse, cover the rear.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.233
Kai, with me.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.512
Lennox Kay?
Federal agents.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.314
Anyone home?

15:57.290 --> 15:58.391
Federal agents.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.293
Put your hands up.

16:03.930 --> 16:06.233
Turn around slowly.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.837
Hey, Jane Tennant.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.374
Looks like we're all
late to the party.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.385
Kai, can you call it in?
One dead body

16:25.485 --> 16:26.986
and one person of interest.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.355
On it, boss.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.357
Are you gonna put
the cuffs on me?

16:30.457 --> 16:32.292
Not a good look
standing over a dead body.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.593
I arrived moments before you.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.495
Got sick of those
perfect sunsets again?

16:35.595 --> 16:37.564
Something like that.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.999
I'm sorry, how do you
two know each other?

16:40.100 --> 16:41.401
Charlie 1.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.770
He gave us the assist
in the Manila situation.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.938
How's Captain Milius, anyway?

16:46.039 --> 16:47.340
Charlie 1?

16:47.440 --> 16:49.442
That's what they call me.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.145
Why are you here?

16:52.245 --> 16:53.146
Same reason you are.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.048
Dead guy on the floor.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.386
What are you doing?

16:59.486 --> 17:02.155
I am looking for snacks.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.456
This is an active crime scene.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.192
Yeah, but I already
touched these.

17:05.292 --> 17:06.359
Put 'em back.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.495
MCRT and M.E. are on their way.

17:09.496 --> 17:10.597
I could save you the trouble.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.099
I already know
who did it.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.133
Who's that?

17:13.233 --> 17:14.767
His name's Harom.

17:16.603 --> 17:17.804
That's all?

17:18.671 --> 17:19.472
What more do you need?

17:19.572 --> 17:20.573
A lot more.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.875
Motive, evidence, context...

17:22.975 --> 17:24.477
Last name.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.813
Well, I can't
get into it.

17:26.913 --> 17:28.281
Sorry, just...

17:28.381 --> 17:29.616
Who's this guy?

17:30.417 --> 17:31.618
That's Charlie 1.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.386
For real?
He's a contractor.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.654
Black ops.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.456
Oh, that explains it.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.990
We're not all bad.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.626
Maybe. But none of you should
be working on U.S. soil.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.494
Tell us who Harom is.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.165
Kobani. Eight years ago.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.634
Operation Blue Delta.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.035
U.S. trained a Free Syrian Army

17:49.136 --> 17:51.538
as part of the resistance
to the Assad regime.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.741
A lot of those guys switched
sides, became loyalists.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.177
Harom was never in it
for ideology.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.645
He's straight-up mercenary.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.447
Like you?

18:00.547 --> 18:03.150
No, sir. I'm a patriot.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.618
And how do you know
so much about Harom?

18:07.754 --> 18:09.522
'Cause I'm the one
who trained him.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.894
Okay, sure.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.496
Talk soon.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.231
I know, me, too.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.503
Hey, I know that smile.
How's Lucy?

18:23.603 --> 18:25.605
Good. Settling into
the aircraft carrier.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.240
Only got lost
once this week.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.409
Yeah, well, that is,
that's progress.

18:29.509 --> 18:32.078
You know, I-I spent like two
months on one of those things

18:32.179 --> 18:33.346
and I could never find the mess.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.183
Well, she's a
quick learner. Yeah.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.884
She'll be running
that place soon.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.186
Yeah.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.388
You miss her, though, huh?

18:41.488 --> 18:42.955
Yeah, I do.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.157
You want to talk AJ?

18:44.257 --> 18:46.559
Yeah. Yeah. Did you take a look?

18:46.659 --> 18:48.528
I did, it's...

18:48.628 --> 18:49.862
it's interesting.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.065
"Interesting" in a
criminal conspiracy way?

18:53.166 --> 18:55.235
Um, not sure yet.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.670
Look, he is...

18:57.770 --> 18:59.606
He's pouring money
into these businesses.

18:59.706 --> 19:00.640
Way more than
they're worth.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.442
Profit margins don't add up.

19:02.542 --> 19:03.810
Well, it could just
be bad business.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.112
AJ has control
of the Koa organization.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.715
There's millions
of their blood money.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.683
He's cleaning it.
There's no other explanation.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.785
Okay, but is there
other evidence?

19:12.885 --> 19:14.287
You want to make
a RICO case,

19:14.387 --> 19:16.623
you need to prove two or more
instances of racketeering.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.090
We can do that.

19:18.191 --> 19:19.859
That AJ knew he was engaged
in a criminal act.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.628
We can do that, too. <i>We...</i>

19:21.728 --> 19:23.162
are not doing anything.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.163
Whistler.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.032
This is a solid case.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.568
What is your stake here?

19:30.069 --> 19:31.704
I'm looking after my community.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.373
No, you've been building
this case in your off time.

19:33.473 --> 19:34.707
There's more.

19:38.211 --> 19:43.049
AJ and I, we...
we grew up together.

19:43.149 --> 19:45.585
And he is...

19:45.685 --> 19:47.754
he is someone that
I thought I knew.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.258
Right. It's personal.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.694
It can be personal
and a good case.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.596
If I go out on a limb...

19:56.696 --> 19:58.030
Are you going out on a limb?

19:58.130 --> 19:59.466
If I do,

19:59.566 --> 20:03.102
you got to stay clear
and let FBI do what we do.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.271
Sure.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.438
Of course.
But does that mean...?

20:05.538 --> 20:07.006
I'm gonna take it up the chain.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.109
Okay.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.912
Hmm. Working hard, I see.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.214
I needed a break
from the new guy.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.817
I thought Alan was
sequestered in the A/V room.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.619
No, I mean the
other new guy.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.721
What kind of person
goes by a call sign?

20:21.821 --> 20:23.656
Pilots mostly.
Some hackers, I think.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.858
And, weirdly, the towel guy
at the health club.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.127
Makes us call him Sweet-Dog.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.829
It's sketchy, Ern.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.799
Not going by an actual name?
Charlie 1?

20:32.899 --> 20:34.100
Come on. What is that?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.969
I won't comment
on the nomenclature,

20:37.069 --> 20:39.306
but Charlie 1
was right about Harom.

20:43.376 --> 20:46.145
Lennox has a few Ring cameras
set up around his property.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.181
Uh, no sign of the suspects
going in or out.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.450
However,

20:50.550 --> 20:52.919
on the inside
he had a SirGawain.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.489
You gonna tell me what that is?

20:56.589 --> 20:59.326
It's a mini indoor spy cam.
Practically undetectable.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.927
Marketed for keeping
an eye on the nanny

21:01.027 --> 21:02.462
but equally useful
for identifying

21:02.562 --> 21:03.796
homicidal mercenaries.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.998
Well, sadly,
he only had the one.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.104
We all know what happened next.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.039
Yeah.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.441
Tell me more about Harom.

21:14.541 --> 21:16.075
Okay.

21:16.175 --> 21:17.710
Harom Ahmad.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.813
Made his bones wreaking
international havoc.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.081
"Kidnapping
for ransom,

21:22.181 --> 21:25.184
murder for hire,
causing civil unrest"?

21:25.284 --> 21:26.819
You know. The usual.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.287
Now he's killing
actors and directors

21:28.388 --> 21:30.357
all because of some safe house
training video?

21:30.457 --> 21:32.892
My guess: he was paid
to track down someone else

21:32.992 --> 21:33.960
connected to the video,

21:34.060 --> 21:36.396
or a safe house itself.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.631
There's got to be
dozens of those.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.567
Yes. Let's narrow it down.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.301
I scoured Lennox's cell phone.

21:42.402 --> 21:45.838
Lennox has over 126
saved text chains.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.106
Which makes him
a hoarder, really.

21:47.206 --> 21:48.140
But I shouldn't speak
ill of the dead.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.476
Ernie.

21:49.576 --> 21:51.277
The interesting thing
is what's not on it.

21:51.378 --> 21:53.746
A deleted text chain
with an unknown number.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.415
Either Lennox
had something to hide...

21:55.515 --> 21:58.551
Or someone wanted to make sure
no one found those messages.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.119
You get a trace on the number?

22:00.219 --> 22:01.153
Well, not exactly.

22:01.253 --> 22:02.589
At least not yet.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.557
But the SMS records
helped identify the messages

22:04.657 --> 22:05.792
came from Oaxaca,

22:05.892 --> 22:07.527
South Coast of Mexico.

22:08.294 --> 22:12.131
Oaxaca's a delightful region
known for its seven moles,

22:12.231 --> 22:14.534
outstanding mescals,
and, of course,

22:14.634 --> 22:15.568
its bustling cartel culture.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.003
It also covers

22:17.103 --> 22:21.841
36 million square miles
and has 570 municipalities.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.376
Harom could be anywhere there.

22:23.476 --> 22:24.711
Not anywhere.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.679
He's looking for a
safe house. Why?

22:26.779 --> 22:28.981
Could be for a
target held there.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.784
We don't even know if there are
any safe houses in Oaxaca.

22:31.884 --> 22:34.954
<i>We</i> don't.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.456
Why would you assume I do?

22:36.556 --> 22:37.457
Don't you?

22:37.557 --> 22:38.758
Really couldn't say.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.427
That's a yes.

22:40.527 --> 22:41.994
No. It's coy noncommitment.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.130
Harom's likely heading
there as we speak.

22:44.230 --> 22:47.834
Someone's in a safe house
he's going to extract or kill.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.769
Solid theory.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.070
I'll let you know
what I find.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.138
Hey.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.272
No, you can't just
go by yourself.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.374
That's literally
what I'm paid for.

22:55.475 --> 22:56.843
This is our case.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.711
NCIS needs to
be involved.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.079
We'll all go together.

23:00.179 --> 23:02.181
That's a lot of
declarative statements.

23:02.281 --> 23:03.650
Look, I know you want
to protect your mission.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.284
But if it wasn't
for our investigation,

23:05.384 --> 23:08.421
you wouldn't know what Harom
was after or where he was going.

23:09.489 --> 23:10.990
I mean, I would have eventually.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.392
We all want the
same thing here.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.762
Yes. What I do and what
you do are different.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.730
A team of federal agents
need permission

23:17.830 --> 23:19.131
to operate in
a foreign country.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.901
That's phone calls.
Red tape. Approvals.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.169
Okay, what
do you need?

23:23.269 --> 23:25.271
A small jet
and some good fortune.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.007
Can't be responsible
for a bunch of Navy cops

23:28.107 --> 23:29.709
getting shot at on foreign soil.

23:30.810 --> 23:31.878
So just take me.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.379
Wait. What?

23:33.480 --> 23:36.048
Hey, you have no idea what
you'd be walking into.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.717
Actually,
I have some idea.

23:38.551 --> 23:39.819
I've done it before.

23:42.455 --> 23:43.923
Otherwise, we might
have to detain you

23:44.023 --> 23:45.892
for questioning in
the Lennox Kay murder.

23:47.694 --> 23:50.129
Yeah, okay. Why not?

23:51.197 --> 23:52.398
We leave now?

24:00.973 --> 24:02.141
Hello?

24:02.241 --> 24:04.243
Hey. Sorry I had to leave
so quickly, hon.

24:04.343 --> 24:05.244
It's all good.

24:05.344 --> 24:06.913
Jules is cool to stay with Dad

24:07.013 --> 24:08.180
and hang with the baby.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.049
Sensing you're not cool with it?

24:10.149 --> 24:12.118
Nah, I'm just gonna
chill at home.

24:12.852 --> 24:13.853
Okay.

24:13.953 --> 24:14.621
Well, remember
the rules, all right?

24:14.721 --> 24:15.622
No parties,

24:15.722 --> 24:16.823
no drinking...

24:16.923 --> 24:18.357
In bed by 10:00.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.358
Don't worry, Jane.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.493
I'll keep him honest.

24:22.529 --> 24:23.630
Cassandra's there.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.131
Making pasta

24:25.231 --> 24:26.866
and making sure Alex finishes
his social studies paper.

24:26.966 --> 24:27.867
How sweet.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.101
Though I have to say,

24:29.201 --> 24:30.703
it feels like this
teacher is taking

24:30.803 --> 24:32.705
colonialism from the point
of view of the colonialists.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.507
Uh, yeah. Hey, Alex?

24:34.607 --> 24:36.743
It's aggressively
patriarchal, don't you think?

24:36.843 --> 24:38.077
I never really have. Alex?

24:38.177 --> 24:39.378
I mean, really,
the whole concept

24:39.478 --> 24:40.947
of social studies
is completely antiquated.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.516
Yep. Alex, take me
off speaker, please.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.586
Yep, done.

24:46.686 --> 24:49.055
And don't worry, I'm not
gonna burn my history book.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.456
That's not what
I'm worried about.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.191
I didn't know that you
were gonna have a guest.

24:52.291 --> 24:55.795
Uh, yeah. Cassandra stopped by
to keep me company.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.129
Look, just 'cause you're 18

24:57.229 --> 24:58.598
doesn't mean that
the rules have changed.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.232
Mom, I get it.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.067
Do you?

25:01.167 --> 25:03.536
Yes. Okay? Promise.

25:03.636 --> 25:04.971
Have a safe flight.

25:05.071 --> 25:06.272
Okay. You be...

25:07.907 --> 25:08.808
...safe, too.

25:13.445 --> 25:14.446
All good at home?

25:15.748 --> 25:17.550
Don't have teenagers.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.953
There's nothing
you can do about it here.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.421
Might as well settle in.

25:23.489 --> 25:25.291
Want a snack?

25:26.025 --> 25:27.293
No, thanks.

25:28.460 --> 25:29.829
But, hey,

25:29.929 --> 25:32.131
just so I understand,

25:32.231 --> 25:35.034
what exactly is your objective
when you find Harom?

25:36.002 --> 25:37.536
Between friends?

25:37.637 --> 25:39.371
Is that what we are?

25:39.471 --> 25:41.908
Well, we worked
two missions together.

25:42.008 --> 25:44.944
Well, A) this mission
is still ongoing,

25:45.044 --> 25:46.979
B) the last one was a quickie.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.547
Didn't even amount
to a first date.

25:48.648 --> 25:51.517
Depends on the date.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.722
Let's just see how this one
turns out, Jane Tennant.

25:55.822 --> 25:57.757
That's not fair.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.191
You know my full name.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.461
And I just know
your... boy band name.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.196
You really need
a name to know me?

26:04.296 --> 26:06.633
Oh, no, no. I know plenty.

26:07.499 --> 26:08.534
That so?

26:10.202 --> 26:12.104
Guys who like code names
and secret ops

26:12.204 --> 26:13.572
only grow on one kind of tree.

26:13.673 --> 26:16.575
You're former military.
Tier One operator.

26:16.676 --> 26:19.679
Now, the obvious choice
would be SEALs or Delta.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.047
But you're not obvious.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.548
You got tricks.

26:23.683 --> 26:26.352
Let's say Task Force Orange.

26:31.190 --> 26:34.593
See, you're no enigma,
Charlie 1.

26:34.694 --> 26:37.196
But I am starting to worry
that you have a tapeworm.

26:49.408 --> 26:50.342
Oh.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.111
Thought these guys were friends.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.714
Friends of friends, actually.

26:54.814 --> 26:55.815
This stuff's for Harom.

26:55.915 --> 26:57.917
No cuffs, huh?

26:58.017 --> 26:59.585
I'm not law enforcement.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.822
I'm starting to get an idea of
what your objective with Harom.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.957
I'm not law enforcement.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.226
But not a hired
killer either.

27:07.326 --> 27:08.828
I need to bring him in,
one way or another.

27:08.928 --> 27:09.896
Let's stick
with one way.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.364
Let him answer
for his crimes.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.566
You're not a closed book
either, Jane Tennant.

27:14.667 --> 27:17.469
That little guessing game you
played on the plane earlier?

27:17.569 --> 27:19.739
Like ten hours ago?

27:19.839 --> 27:20.840
Good boss.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.041
Sees her team
as family

27:22.141 --> 27:23.843
and family as everything.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.278
Believe in law and order,
but you didn't always.

27:26.946 --> 27:27.847
That so?

27:27.947 --> 27:30.316
You've done this before.

27:30.416 --> 27:33.052
Uncertain mission.
No parameters.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.621
Questionable company.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.423
CIA, right?

27:39.191 --> 27:40.659
Couldn't tell you if I wanted.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.196
Hola, gentlemen.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.239
Let's roll.

28:14.093 --> 28:15.261
It's definitely remote.

28:15.361 --> 28:18.230
It's one way to keep
a safe house safe.

28:19.598 --> 28:21.734
I'd feel safer
with my own team.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.736
So, what do we do?
Just knock?

28:23.836 --> 28:25.337
No need.

28:36.983 --> 28:38.617
Doesn't look open
for business.

28:39.685 --> 28:40.987
Which means no one's
staying here.

28:41.087 --> 28:41.988
Well, I'm staying here.

28:42.088 --> 28:43.990
At least for a week.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.825
I'm Duggy.

28:45.925 --> 28:48.127
Guessing you two are government.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.230
Special Agent
Jane Tennant, NCIS.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.866
Navy police in Mexico?

28:53.966 --> 28:55.601
That's interesting.

28:55.701 --> 28:56.602
And you are?

28:56.702 --> 28:57.736
Charlie 1.

28:57.837 --> 28:58.737
Oh, yeah.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.739
Your type I'm used to.

29:01.707 --> 29:03.375
Look, you got
identification, Duggy?

29:03.475 --> 29:05.945
Uh, never thought I'd be carded

29:06.045 --> 29:07.814
in the middle of
my own safe house.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.583
What can I do for you?

29:11.683 --> 29:13.820
Several people back in the
States were murdered.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.188
All connected to
a safe house training video.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.124
I know that video.

29:18.224 --> 29:19.458
I wrote the script.

29:19.558 --> 29:20.726
You did?

29:20.827 --> 29:23.129
Yeah-- well,
the technical script.

29:23.229 --> 29:25.297
I design safe houses.

29:25.397 --> 29:26.966
Facilitate security measures.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.801
And no one else
is coming here?

29:28.901 --> 29:30.002
Just me.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.972
And my crew
during work hours.

29:33.072 --> 29:34.206
Who killed
those people?

29:34.306 --> 29:35.407
His name's Harom.

29:35.507 --> 29:36.976
He's a soldier
for hire.

29:37.076 --> 29:38.544
You know him?

29:39.345 --> 29:40.579
No.

29:40.679 --> 29:42.514
He'd be wasting
his time coming here.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.051
How many of these safe houses
you know about?

29:45.151 --> 29:46.452
All of 'em.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.654
If I'm not building 'em,
I'm updating 'em.

29:48.754 --> 29:51.123
So, you know where
every safe house is located?

29:51.223 --> 29:52.424
Yeah.

29:54.526 --> 29:55.895
All right, we need to
get out of here now.

29:55.995 --> 29:56.929
Why?

29:57.029 --> 29:59.098
Because your Harom's target.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.081
Where'd the cavalry go?

30:15.181 --> 30:16.282
No clue.

30:19.818 --> 30:20.853
All right, I count
at least five.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.788
No one's being kept here.

30:22.889 --> 30:23.822
What do they want?

30:23.923 --> 30:24.957
They want you, Duggy.

30:25.057 --> 30:26.425
Why would they want me?

30:26.525 --> 30:28.294
Because you know where all
the safe houses are.

30:28.394 --> 30:29.695
And how they operate.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.468
Harom's gonna cut
the comms and feeds.

30:36.568 --> 30:37.937
We've got maybe two minutes.

30:39.438 --> 30:40.839
Or less.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.574
All right, you got
a secure line?

30:42.674 --> 30:44.610
Uh, no line,
no Internet.

30:44.710 --> 30:47.246
We're not operational yet.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.614
Just this sat phone.

30:48.714 --> 30:50.782
That'll do.

30:54.453 --> 30:57.023
Harom was flagged at
the Oaxaca International Airport

30:57.123 --> 30:59.725
about three hours before
Tennant and Charlie 1 landed.

30:59.825 --> 31:00.993
Then he disappeared.

31:01.093 --> 31:02.394
I've been trying to
get boss on the phone.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.230
No signal.

31:04.330 --> 31:05.331
Can you track her?

31:05.431 --> 31:06.798
Well, no signal
means no signal.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.234
Wherever she is, it's
another black hole.

31:09.101 --> 31:10.302
So we're in the dark.

31:13.505 --> 31:14.673
That's the secure line.

31:14.773 --> 31:16.275
So answer it.

31:16.375 --> 31:17.843
What? Really?

31:20.312 --> 31:21.713
Boss, that you?

31:21.813 --> 31:23.749
Hey, guys. We got a situation
and not a lot of time.

31:23.849 --> 31:26.352
Okay, what's going on?
Harom and his guys
are at the safe house.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.387
They're about to breach
any moment. We need help.

31:28.487 --> 31:30.722
I'm contacting the Federales
and the FBI right now.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.024
Who's the target?

31:32.124 --> 31:34.126
Duggy Atwater,
safe house architect.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.694
We have him secure right now
but not for long.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.930
All right, listen, I need
you to alert all agencies:

31:38.030 --> 31:39.831
safe houses may be compromised.

31:39.932 --> 31:43.235
Got it.
Gonna need some idea where
you are so we can send backup.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.139
Boss?

31:48.340 --> 31:49.108
Ernie?

31:49.208 --> 31:50.509
They're in. We got to go.

31:50.609 --> 31:52.911
They jammed the signal.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.446
Can you get a trace
on the sat line?

31:54.546 --> 31:57.216
I-I can try to pick up
any satellites in the area.

31:58.750 --> 31:59.851
Maybe you can
reverse engineer.

31:59.952 --> 32:01.253
Track the
last signal

32:01.353 --> 32:02.921
from Tennant's cell phone
before it went dead.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.623
Look for any government
black holes in the area.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.425
Good call.
Okay, keep at it.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.995
Jesse and I will see
about getting that backup.

32:10.129 --> 32:11.130
They jammed comms
and breached.

32:11.230 --> 32:12.598
We need
an exit strategy.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.433
Okay, every safe house has
an escape tunnel, right?

32:14.533 --> 32:16.035
First thing we built.

32:16.135 --> 32:18.370
Uh, there's a trap door
at the other end of the house.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.606
All right, we move.
Out there?

32:20.706 --> 32:21.607
With them inside?

32:21.707 --> 32:22.608
You got a better idea?

32:22.708 --> 32:23.942
I got a safer one.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.777
The panic room
at the end of the hall.

32:25.877 --> 32:27.879
Four-inch-thick, steel-plated.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.681
I'd rather not be a sitting duck
in a steel cage.

32:29.781 --> 32:30.916
Harom will eventually breach it.

32:31.017 --> 32:32.818
What other defenses do we have?

32:32.918 --> 32:34.086
Not much yet.

32:34.186 --> 32:37.123
No IR sensors,
no motion detectors.

32:37.223 --> 32:40.659
Uh, the burn switch is
only active in the server room.

32:40.759 --> 32:42.794
The tunnel it is.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.508
We got to move before...

33:05.751 --> 33:06.985
How bad?
I'm fine.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.854
That doesn't
look fine to me.

33:09.688 --> 33:10.522
You got a first aid kit?

33:10.622 --> 33:11.690
Yeah, in the panic room.

33:11.790 --> 33:13.325
We don't have time.

33:13.425 --> 33:14.660
We need to get
to the tunnel.
They know where we are.

33:14.760 --> 33:15.994
We won't make it.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.429
Listen, that is
stinkin' thinkin', Duggy.

33:17.529 --> 33:18.597
He's right.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.232
Panic room's
our best bad option.

33:20.932 --> 33:22.168
Lead the way.
All right.

33:26.472 --> 33:27.773
I got a general location.

33:27.873 --> 33:30.976
Rural housing community
Loma Bonita in Oaxaca.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.611
Three hours from the airport.

33:32.711 --> 33:33.745
Not a lot of
good it'll do.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.114
I can't get through
to the backup.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.782
A lot of these smaller
Federale stations

33:36.882 --> 33:37.849
are manned
by two agents.

33:37.949 --> 33:38.950
Haven't been able to get ahold

33:39.051 --> 33:40.052
of the FBI Legal Attaché Office

33:40.152 --> 33:41.920
in Mexico City either.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.389
Don't worry, I have.

33:43.489 --> 33:45.023
Figured I'd rattle some
cages on your behalf.

33:45.124 --> 33:46.892
My colleagues put in
a call to the Federales

33:46.992 --> 33:48.794
who escorted
Tennant and Charlie 1.

33:48.894 --> 33:49.795
No response.

33:49.895 --> 33:50.796
Not good news.

33:50.896 --> 33:52.331
We're on it.

33:52.431 --> 33:53.965
There's a joint Mexico-DEA
task force in the area,

33:54.066 --> 33:55.167
and they're heading
to the safe house.

33:55.267 --> 33:55.934
How long?

33:56.034 --> 33:58.003
20 to 30 minutes.

34:00.306 --> 34:01.607
Let's pray they make it
there on time.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.512
All right, where's
the panic room?

34:16.755 --> 34:18.190
This place gonna hold?
It certainly should.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.259
Once we're locked inside,

34:20.359 --> 34:22.027
it'll take them
hours to breach.

34:22.128 --> 34:23.595
You two should be safe in here.

34:23.695 --> 34:24.996
We'll <i>all</i> be safe.

34:25.097 --> 34:26.165
Until backup arrives.

34:26.265 --> 34:27.199
This is too risky.

34:27.299 --> 34:28.467
You stay in here with Duggy.

34:28.567 --> 34:29.668
I'll draw Harom away.

34:29.768 --> 34:31.203
Look, you don't need
to impress me.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.638
I already know you're a badass.

34:33.639 --> 34:34.706
It's a smart move.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.942
Okay. You're right.

34:37.476 --> 34:38.877
But I'm the only one
who can walk.

34:38.977 --> 34:40.512
Hey, wait.

34:40.612 --> 34:41.513
Wait! Wait, wait!

34:55.394 --> 34:57.629
This is really stupid, Jane.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.907
It's Tennant.
We got to go now.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.777
That was low.
It worked, didn't it?

35:45.877 --> 35:47.078
Think I got 'em all,
but I don't want

35:47.179 --> 35:48.647
to stick around and find out.
Let's go.

35:56.355 --> 35:57.723
Watch your step.
Right here.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.064
Keep moving.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.900
Put the guns down.

36:11.470 --> 36:13.004
Harom.

36:13.104 --> 36:14.573
Long time.

36:14.673 --> 36:15.874
Get on your knees.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.709
No one else needs to get hurt.

36:17.809 --> 36:20.145
Says the woman who tried
to burn me alive.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.414
Get on
your knees!

36:22.514 --> 36:24.216
Hand over the architect.

36:24.316 --> 36:26.818
And I'll
make it quick.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.391
You know we
can't do that.

36:32.491 --> 36:33.825
Then I'll kill you first.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.160
You sure
about that?

36:35.261 --> 36:36.595
Harom. Think fast!

36:49.375 --> 36:51.109
He's wounded.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.010
Not dead.

36:52.110 --> 36:53.479
Good.

36:53.579 --> 36:55.647
I was looking forward
to some alone time with him.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.151
Here comes the cavalry.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.522
Told you my team
would deliver.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.668
The architect is safe,

37:16.768 --> 37:18.270
Harom's in custody,

37:18.370 --> 37:20.005
and the boss and Charlie 1
are on their way back home.

37:20.105 --> 37:23.642
Taking out Harom and his crew
is next-level G.I. Jane.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.944
She didn't even
need the backup.

37:26.044 --> 37:28.447
Well, they were happy
for the ride home.

37:28.547 --> 37:30.616
I got it, guys.

37:30.716 --> 37:31.883
I found the connection.

37:31.983 --> 37:33.352
What do you mean, Alan?

37:33.452 --> 37:36.622
Took me hours to scour
the training videos.

37:36.722 --> 37:38.123
Then create a universal matrix

37:38.223 --> 37:41.593
of every actor, crew member,
and production staff,

37:41.693 --> 37:43.829
but I found out
who Harom is after.

37:43.929 --> 37:46.298
Duggy Atwater.
Safe house architect.

37:46.398 --> 37:47.833
Yes.

37:47.933 --> 37:48.900
How did you...?

37:49.000 --> 37:50.569
We were on that a day ago.

37:50.669 --> 37:53.305
Yeah. Case solved.

37:53.405 --> 37:54.406
Harom's done.

37:55.106 --> 37:59.210
But I've been down in
the media room for 36 hours.

38:00.312 --> 38:01.547
Didn't eat.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.615
Or sleep. Or...

38:03.715 --> 38:04.883
Dude, we're so sorry.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.585
Everything was
just moving so fast.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.387
Yeah...

38:08.487 --> 38:09.455
but good work, though.

38:09.555 --> 38:10.789
Mm, yeah.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.525
Not cool, guys.

38:13.625 --> 38:16.127
Not cool at all.

38:17.663 --> 38:20.599
Hey, Alan. Alan.

38:20.699 --> 38:21.967
Wait up.

38:22.868 --> 38:24.636
Look...

38:24.736 --> 38:26.905
you A-Teamed the
crap out of this.

38:27.005 --> 38:28.774
All right, man?

38:32.411 --> 38:33.512
Heard it all worked out?

38:33.612 --> 38:35.347
Yeah.
I spoke to Tennant.

38:35.447 --> 38:38.149
Uh, also spoke to
my boss about AJ.

38:38.249 --> 38:39.150
Oh, yeah?

38:39.250 --> 38:40.586
Did he agree to take the case?

38:40.686 --> 38:42.454
Yeah.

38:42.554 --> 38:43.655
But there's a problem.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.457
What kind of problem?

38:45.557 --> 38:49.027
Well, we did some digging
on AJ's investments, and...

38:49.127 --> 38:50.596
the businesses you identified

38:50.696 --> 38:52.731
weren't the only ones
to receive cash.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.266
Okay. And?

38:57.068 --> 38:59.170
One of them was your father's.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.373
No.

39:01.473 --> 39:02.474
No, my dad would never...

39:02.574 --> 39:04.776
But he did, Kai.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.112
When?

39:07.212 --> 39:08.847
Two years ago.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.750
Wally's Eatery received
a $50,000 investment.

39:11.850 --> 39:15.086
Look, I don't need to tell you
what the optics on this are.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.188
A federal agent's father
taking blood money.

39:17.288 --> 39:19.290
We are not sure
that's what happened. No.

39:19.391 --> 39:21.427
But we will need to
question your father.

39:21.527 --> 39:22.561
When?

39:22.661 --> 39:23.762
Soon.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.631
Okay.

39:25.731 --> 39:27.899
You'll want to talk to him.

39:39.344 --> 39:41.212
<i>I think you should've
stayed at the hospital.</i>

39:41.312 --> 39:45.050
For this? 'Tis but a scratch.

39:45.851 --> 39:46.852
Besides,

39:46.952 --> 39:48.353
I like to sleep in my own bed

39:48.454 --> 39:49.488
any chance I can get.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.289
Same.

39:52.958 --> 39:55.060
I learned something
else about you today.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.094
Do tell.

39:56.194 --> 39:57.663
You like to be in control.

39:57.763 --> 39:59.865
Is that a bad thing?

40:00.832 --> 40:02.133
No. It's just a thing.

40:03.869 --> 40:06.838
I'm guessing you've been
burned in the past.

40:07.739 --> 40:10.742
By a spouse,
a colleague,

40:10.842 --> 40:12.077
a parent?

40:14.279 --> 40:16.147
Well, since it's clear
you're too proud to tell me

40:16.247 --> 40:18.183
how grateful you are
for saving your ass...

40:20.919 --> 40:22.320
I mean, I feel like we
saved each other.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.356
In lieu of a thank you,
I'll take a first name.

40:28.026 --> 40:29.027
Charlemagne.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.962
What?

40:31.062 --> 40:34.432
First emperor of the
Holy Roman Empire.

40:34.533 --> 40:35.433
Also known as...

40:35.534 --> 40:37.936
Charles I.

40:38.036 --> 40:39.370
Very cute.

40:40.205 --> 40:42.874
Blame my
history-teaching mother.

40:43.942 --> 40:47.178
Well, Charlemagne,

40:47.278 --> 40:49.380
your secret is safe with me.

40:53.652 --> 40:55.120
Mm-hmm.

41:08.534 --> 41:11.169
Oh, great, you're
up early, Alex.

41:11.269 --> 41:13.972
Thank goodness.
I'm gonna need you to get Julie

41:14.072 --> 41:15.807
because I am exhausted...

41:15.907 --> 41:17.776
Hey, Jane.
Alex is still sleeping.

41:17.876 --> 41:20.411
But I'd be happy
to grab Jules.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.315
Uh...

41:24.415 --> 41:27.052
Maybe make you some
oatmeal pancakes first?

41:28.419 --> 41:29.487
Alex!
