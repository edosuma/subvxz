WEBVTT

00:08.383 --> 00:09.384
Where am I?

00:11.845 --> 00:12.971
Oh, no!

00:14.348 --> 00:15.849
What am I holding on to?

00:18.435 --> 00:19.436
Nothing!

00:24.983 --> 00:25.984
Oh, no.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.239
Thank you, Mr. Gorg.

00:30.322 --> 00:31.698
You're welcome.

00:31.782 --> 00:36.286
If we're all gonna make it,
it's gonna take all of us.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.413
All of us.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.040
All of us.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.500
All of us.

00:41.583 --> 00:44.753
All of us.

00:44.837 --> 00:47.923
All of-- All of us.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.675
Yeah. We're here. All of us.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.885
You were making wacky noises
in your sleep.

00:51.969 --> 00:54.221
-Well--
-We wanted to see what was going on.

00:54.304 --> 00:57.766
I'm very good at dream interpretation.
Just tell me the medium.

00:57.850 --> 01:01.395
Dance, paint, mixed media,
whatever you want.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.522
I'm so glad you're all here.

01:03.605 --> 01:07.526
You know how everyone's working together
to fix the problems in Fraggle Rock?

01:07.609 --> 01:10.237
Yeah. We're working
with the Doozers to stack pebbles

01:10.320 --> 01:12.698
so we can plug up the hole
to the Crevice of Solitude

01:12.781 --> 01:14.741
and redirect water to Craggle Lagoon.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.285
And we've been using the vines

01:16.368 --> 01:19.746
to get the goo out of the water
for our Merggle brothers and sisters.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.958
Nature healing nature
Ooh wha-oo

01:23.041 --> 01:24.459
Wow, that's really good.

01:24.543 --> 01:28.213
The last time you didn't do that
"ooh wha-oo" part, but it adds a lot.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.048
-Thank you for saying that.
-Plus,

01:30.132 --> 01:32.634
the Wise Council has a plan for us all

01:32.718 --> 01:37.723
to sneak attack the Gorgs' fountain,
so we can get our waterfall back.

01:37.806 --> 01:42.060
Yeah. About that. See, I don't think
we should attack the Gorgs' fountain.

01:42.144 --> 01:45.522
My dream made it pretty clear
that we should work with the Gorgs.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.901
Let's bring them into the plan.
Great idea, right?

02:00.120 --> 02:01.663
Oh, Gobo.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.916
I just, I just, I just--

02:03.999 --> 02:05.000
The Gorgs!

02:07.628 --> 02:09.713
I forget what we're laughing about,

02:09.795 --> 02:12.549
but all you guys laughing
is making me laugh.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.988
Dance your cares away

02:35.072 --> 02:37.032
Worry's for another day

02:37.115 --> 02:39.117
Let the music play

02:39.201 --> 02:40.994
Down at Fraggle Rock

02:41.078 --> 02:43.163
Work your cares away

02:43.247 --> 02:45.457
Dancing's for another day

02:45.541 --> 02:46.959
Let the Fraggles play

02:47.042 --> 02:48.043
-We're Gobo.
-Mokey.

02:48.126 --> 02:48.961
-Wembley.
-Boober.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.712
-Red. Whoo!
-Whoopee!

02:53.298 --> 02:54.383
Junior!

02:55.050 --> 02:56.385
Hello!

02:57.803 --> 02:58.804
My radish.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.057
Dance your cares away

03:02.140 --> 03:04.184
Worry's for another day

03:04.268 --> 03:06.144
Let the music play

03:06.228 --> 03:07.729
Down at Fraggle Rock

03:08.355 --> 03:09.773
Down at Fraggle Rock

03:10.315 --> 03:11.900
Down at Fraggle Rock.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.613
Okay. It's all happening.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.241
Everything comes down to this.

03:19.324 --> 03:22.494
Either I successfully grow a bacteria

03:22.578 --> 03:25.998
that could clean the ocean
of microplastics

03:26.081 --> 03:30.752
or I get laughed out of school and have to
come up with a plan B for my life.

03:30.836 --> 03:34.256
Probably something to do with
training you as a circus dog.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.340
I don't know.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.302
Hey.

03:39.803 --> 03:44.391
All right. I have a few cameras set up
to show my professors my process.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.144
I've got another one
directly on the microscope

03:47.227 --> 03:51.273
to capture the exact moment
that Munchie eats plastic.

03:53.192 --> 03:54.193
All right.

03:54.985 --> 03:59.990
Ruth, Michelle, Shirley,
I need you and the rest of the shero wall

04:00.073 --> 04:03.869
to put out positive thoughts of success
into the universe.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.664
Wait. Where did I put my extra tanks?

04:09.166 --> 04:12.085
Yeah. Right in front of
the big, weird hole in the wall.

04:12.169 --> 04:13.337
I'll need those later.

04:13.420 --> 04:17.548
But first, off to collect
more ocean samples for my tanks.

04:17.632 --> 04:18.759
All right.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.762
Keep an eye on things.
Make sure nothing weird happens.

04:23.222 --> 04:24.473
Why, thank you, madam.

04:26.558 --> 04:29.978
There seems to be some sort of roadblock.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.275
Good day, hairy beast.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.278
Aha. I know what this is.

04:38.362 --> 04:41.448
Gobo knows
I'm coming back from outer space,

04:41.532 --> 04:44.326
so he's throwing me a surprise party,

04:44.409 --> 04:46.995
and you're keeping me occupied
until it's time.

04:47.704 --> 04:51.500
I'll just wait here
until you're ready for me.

04:59.591 --> 05:05.138
Sprocket. This thing lives in the wall
and you were the one to discover it?

05:05.222 --> 05:09.059
I know I'm getting my doctorate,
but you're the genius.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.859
Oh, hairy beast.

05:16.942 --> 05:20.153
Did I ever tell you about the time
I invented pudding?

05:22.739 --> 05:26.243
Thank you for dimming the lights.
Now, where was I?

05:27.828 --> 05:31.415
Gobo. Gobo, Gobo. Say it again.
Stylus didn't hear it before.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.877
I said I think we should
work with the Gorgs.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.175
I'm not joking.

05:41.258 --> 05:44.219
I really do think
we should work with the Gorgs.

05:44.303 --> 05:45.512
Seriously?

05:45.596 --> 05:48.515
But, Gobo, working with them is so--

05:48.599 --> 05:49.641
Dangerous.

05:50.309 --> 05:52.895
What Boober means is, we love you.

05:52.978 --> 05:56.565
But we don't love the idea
of working with the Gorgs because…

05:56.648 --> 05:57.733
They're Gorgs!

05:57.816 --> 06:00.861
Let's just forget it
and do the sneak attack.

06:00.944 --> 06:01.945
Come on.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.989
What do you need to shake it off?

06:04.072 --> 06:07.034
Wanna read one of your uncle's postcards
or something?

06:07.117 --> 06:09.786
For your information,
I didn't get a postcard from him

06:09.870 --> 06:12.748
because he's on his way back
to Fraggle Rock right now.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.374
Wow.

06:14.458 --> 06:16.126
But I tell you one thing.

06:16.210 --> 06:20.339
My uncle would agree with me
because he's the smartest Fraggle I know.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.716
I never miss a thing.

06:22.799 --> 06:27.095
Why, before I invented pudding,
I invented an edible sand.

06:27.679 --> 06:32.309
Gobo, just forget about your dream
and come help us plan the sneak attack.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.727
Let's go!

06:34.686 --> 06:37.439
-Boober made snacks.
-I did?

06:37.523 --> 06:39.358
-You didn't?
-Well, I can.

06:39.441 --> 06:40.943
That'd be great. Thank you.

06:41.026 --> 06:44.571
Something light and refreshing.
Like a, I don't know, radish pizzette.

06:44.655 --> 06:47.407
Well, I'll meet up with you buds later.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.869
Time to put the "go" in Gobo.

06:58.168 --> 07:02.214
My Junior Junior. My sweet little tree.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.759
I miss you so much.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.641
Excuse me, Mr. Gorg.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.393
Hello.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.813
My name is Gobo Fraggle and I'm a Fraggle.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.690
It's not just part of my name.

07:19.773 --> 07:24.069
And I came here because there's
a big problem with our water.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.321
And it's affecting us all,

07:26.405 --> 07:27.990
because we're all connected.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.826
Anyway, everyone thinks
I'm out of my mind.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.161
But maybe we could work together--

07:33.245 --> 07:36.164
-Oh, no!
-Aha!

07:36.248 --> 07:40.294
Okay. Yeah. This was not a good idea.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.633
Hey, Moke. What's with the Doozer tube?

07:46.717 --> 07:48.260
I'm gonna check with the Doozers

07:48.343 --> 07:51.597
and see if we're close
to getting water back to Craggle Lagoon.

07:52.097 --> 07:56.602
Base to hole. Base to hole. Do you copy?

07:56.685 --> 08:00.647
-Where'd you learn that Doozer tube lingo?
-I know, right? It's so awesome.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.399
-Try to play it cool.
-Yeah.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.485
Hole to base. That's a copy copy.

08:07.696 --> 08:10.032
Copy copy on your copy copy.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.034
Status of Project Pebble Plug.

08:12.117 --> 08:15.829
Project Pebble Plug progressing perfectly.
Payout pronto.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.247
We should have water back

08:17.331 --> 08:20.292
in Craggle Lagoon
by the end of the day. Over.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.544
Thanks for the update, Cotterpin. Over--

08:22.628 --> 08:23.629
Over and out.

08:24.213 --> 08:25.672
Sorry.

08:27.382 --> 08:32.054
Attention. Once the plug is complete,
sneak attack the Gorgs' fountain.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.222
Boober, you have the plan.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.518
What? But I was busy making snacks.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.979
Luckily, I have a spare.

08:41.063 --> 08:42.481
Let's go.

08:42.563 --> 08:43.565
Copy!

08:43.649 --> 08:46.401
Step one: draw up plans
to get our water back.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.278
They're really nice.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.405
So nice. Who did them?

08:50.489 --> 08:51.615
Would you believe it?

08:51.698 --> 08:54.785
-Barry Blueberry.
-Good for him. Follow your passion.

08:54.868 --> 08:59.915
Hey, focus.
Step two: Cotterpin will use a projector

08:59.998 --> 09:04.586
to project a giant image of Pogey
in the Gorgs' garden.

09:04.670 --> 09:10.133
It's gonna look like I'm there,
but I'm not.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.594
Thank you, Pogey. I'll give the details.

09:12.678 --> 09:15.973
Step three:
while the Gorgs are distracted,

09:16.056 --> 09:19.268
the Doozers will sneak
to the side of the fountain

09:19.351 --> 09:25.482
and demolish it with their machines
and tools and, I don't know, Doozer stuff.

09:25.566 --> 09:26.942
I like stuff.

09:27.943 --> 09:30.988
Step four!
With the Gorgs' fountain destroyed,

09:31.071 --> 09:33.907
our water will return
along with our waterfall.

09:33.991 --> 09:37.661
Paving the way for… step five.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.080
Oh, my gosh. Is step five a dance party?

09:40.163 --> 09:43.500
You bet your sweet radish it is!

09:43.584 --> 09:44.585
Yeah!

09:51.133 --> 09:53.135
Hey. Where's Gobo?

09:53.218 --> 09:55.095
He said he was gonna catch up with us--

09:55.179 --> 09:57.848
He probably went to the portal
to see his Uncle Matt.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.142
They have a lot of catching up to do.

10:00.225 --> 10:03.437
You mean,
Gobo's got a lot of listening to do.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.440
His Uncle Matt can talk in his sleep.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.238
What a sleep.

10:13.322 --> 10:17.910
Too bad there's no point in dreaming
because my life is so interesting.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.164
Long overdue for my party.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.292
Even if they're not quite ready,
they'll be happy to see me.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.214
It's a squiggly squid.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.050
Lie still and it won't see you.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.677
Morning, Sprocket!

10:35.761 --> 10:37.554
We are close.

10:37.638 --> 10:40.599
But Munchie is ready
and I am minutes away from

10:40.682 --> 10:46.396
introducing him to a tank full
of microplastics and letting that boy eat.

10:47.523 --> 10:49.775
I've got a feeling this is gonna work.

10:50.526 --> 10:54.988
Care to join me on one of the most
important days of my academic life?

10:57.074 --> 10:58.283
Thanks for having me.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.369
Your hospitality has been most kind.

11:00.452 --> 11:04.081
C'mon, Sprocket.
I'd love your support right now.

11:04.164 --> 11:08.710
I have a party to attend. Can you just
allow me to get through, hairy beast?

11:08.794 --> 11:10.546
Are you coming or not?

11:16.635 --> 11:17.636
Sir.

11:18.220 --> 11:21.807
Can I talk to you?
I just really think if you hear me out--

11:21.890 --> 11:22.891
Quiet!

11:22.975 --> 11:25.227
Okay. I'm sorry.

11:26.395 --> 11:30.107
-I was just telling my friends that I--
-Friends.

11:30.899 --> 11:33.777
What do you mean, "friends"?

11:33.861 --> 11:35.153
Friends are dumb.

11:35.904 --> 11:40.325
I had one once, but then my dad
made me send him away.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.412
That's awful.

11:44.162 --> 11:49.668
Well… I can't quite reach you right now,

11:49.751 --> 11:52.546
but if I could,
I'd give you a comforting pat.

11:54.089 --> 11:57.593
I never should have
thrown him down that well.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.803
You threw your friend down the well?

12:00.971 --> 12:02.848
That's rough.

12:03.557 --> 12:07.644
Junior Junior. My sweet tree.

12:08.812 --> 12:09.980
He was a tree.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.024
That makes more sense.

12:13.192 --> 12:15.152
Wait a second, I know that tree.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.363
Yeah. He fell into the Great Hall
in Fraggle Rock.

12:20.949 --> 12:21.950
What?

12:24.578 --> 12:27.372
If you let me go,
I could bring him to you.

12:28.582 --> 12:33.629
But how do I know I can trust you?
You are a Fraggle.

12:33.712 --> 12:36.965
Well, I came here to ask you
to drain your fountain

12:37.049 --> 12:40.677
because it's taking all of our water
and we're in big trouble.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.846
-Oh, no.
-Let's all of us help each other.

12:42.930 --> 12:47.017
That's the only way things
are gonna change. So, what do you say?

12:47.100 --> 12:48.101
Shake on it?

12:49.937 --> 12:52.231
-Well…
-Yeah.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.525
-If I-- Maybe if I…
-Yeah.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.860
If you reach to the left.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.613
Yeah, maybe, kind of-- Yeah, right there.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.949
You got yourself a deal.

13:02.574 --> 13:03.450
So…

13:05.202 --> 13:07.412
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

13:07.496 --> 13:08.497
Junior!

13:10.874 --> 13:11.875
Hey, Pa.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.753
I was just dancing.

13:14.837 --> 13:19.299
Don't tell a fib.
I saw you let that Fraggle go!

13:21.844 --> 13:24.179
We need to talk.

13:26.098 --> 13:27.641
All right, let's just--

13:28.350 --> 13:30.269
Everybody! Everybody!

13:31.061 --> 13:33.272
I was trapped by a Gorg.

13:35.399 --> 13:39.361
You did it?
You went up there? Unbelievable.

13:39.444 --> 13:43.740
Look, I'm telling you, he may be a Gorg,
but he's not bad.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.910
He did a bad thing,
but he was feeling hurt.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.955
Haven't we all had times
when we weren't our best selves?

13:50.038 --> 13:51.164
Not me.

13:53.208 --> 13:56.461
Okay, I have. I absolutely have.

13:57.212 --> 14:01.216
You buds have been there for me
when I haven't been my best Gobo.

14:01.300 --> 14:04.344
I think that what matters
is what we do next,

14:04.428 --> 14:07.181
meet the moment and how we come together.

14:07.264 --> 14:10.392
He's got it. The Fraggle's got it!

14:10.475 --> 14:12.311
Let's not do a sneak attack.

14:12.394 --> 14:15.814
Let's make a new friend
and build some new trust.

14:15.898 --> 14:18.609
The Gorg will help us
if we bring him his tree.

14:19.234 --> 14:22.946
Come on. Let's all of us do this together.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.489
Yeah!

14:24.573 --> 14:25.657
Yes!

14:27.951 --> 14:31.205
The Fraggle's got it!

14:32.122 --> 14:35.584
Every day the world begins again

14:35.667 --> 14:38.337
Sunny skies or rain

14:38.420 --> 14:40.756
Come and follow me

14:42.424 --> 14:46.345
Every sunrise shows me more and more

14:46.428 --> 14:48.931
So much to explore

14:49.014 --> 14:51.850
Come and follow me

14:53.769 --> 14:57.814
Every morning, every day

14:59.066 --> 15:03.612
Every evening calling me away

15:10.118 --> 15:13.872
While the sun goes round
I'll still be found

15:14.456 --> 15:17.000
Following the sound

15:17.084 --> 15:19.586
Something's calling me

15:21.129 --> 15:24.508
When the world goes
Drifting back to bed

15:25.092 --> 15:27.052
Memories in my head

15:27.803 --> 15:30.389
Wonders follow me

15:32.516 --> 15:36.270
Every morning, every day

15:37.729 --> 15:41.900
Every evening calling me away

15:42.484 --> 15:44.528
We're almost there. Come on!

15:44.611 --> 15:48.782
Every morning, every day

15:49.825 --> 15:54.496
Every evening calling me away

15:57.124 --> 15:59.877
All right.
Right here. This will be perfect. Yeah.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.962
-Let's push it up.
-Push.

16:02.045 --> 16:03.881
Nice. Thanks, everybody.

16:03.964 --> 16:07.301
-Thank you!
-Thank you all so much!

16:07.384 --> 16:08.719
Would you look at this.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.513
Is there a happier Fraggle
than me right now?

16:11.597 --> 16:15.184
I'm so proud of everyone,
and I wanna thank you all for trusting me.

16:15.267 --> 16:16.268
And…

16:17.644 --> 16:18.645
Fraggles.

16:22.316 --> 16:24.610
I thought you said we could trust him.

16:27.321 --> 16:29.615
Something must have changed his mind.

16:30.199 --> 16:31.491
Under here, hurry!

16:32.618 --> 16:35.162
Hurry, under here.
Come on, Wembley. Come on.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.127
Let me through, hairy beast.

16:42.211 --> 16:45.923
Okay, Sprocket.
Munchie's approaching the microplastics,

16:46.006 --> 16:49.801
and we are on target just as long as--

16:49.885 --> 16:52.179
Oh, no! Sprocket, the panel shorted!

16:52.262 --> 16:55.891
I need to reset the breaker.
Sprocket, I'm gonna need your help.

16:55.974 --> 16:57.893
Stand by the microscope camera

16:57.976 --> 17:02.898
and hit record the second we get
power back, or we could lose everything.

17:05.442 --> 17:08.237
Pa told me Fraggles can't be trusted.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.196
You just wanna steal our stuff.

17:10.280 --> 17:15.661
I had to throw Junior Junior down the well
so I don't get distracted again.

17:15.743 --> 17:20.290
So I never forget
to be on the lookout for Fraggles!

17:21.333 --> 17:25.045
That's my boy! That's a real Gorg.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.049
How could I have been so wrong?

17:29.842 --> 17:32.553
Hey, look at it this way.

17:32.636 --> 17:34.471
This is as bad as it can get.

17:34.555 --> 17:37.140
Hey, hey, don't say that.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.309
It can always get worse.

17:39.393 --> 17:41.979
We have a problem.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.731
-See.
-Pebbles didn't hold.

17:44.815 --> 17:47.192
No water making it to Craggle Lagoon.

17:47.276 --> 17:48.360
Project failed.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.529
Over and out.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.866
Well, I guess nothing's working.

17:54.575 --> 17:58.078
We can't even go help
because we're stuck here thanks to me.

17:59.121 --> 18:04.418
Gobo, you believed in the good
of the Gorgs. That was beautiful.

18:04.918 --> 18:08.505
And what about our low moments
not defining us?

18:08.589 --> 18:10.632
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

18:11.466 --> 18:14.303
Thanks for reminding me of
another thing I was wrong about.

18:14.386 --> 18:18.557
Our low moments do define us, 'cause this
sure as potato is gonna define me.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.393
The time Gobo Fraggle ruined everything.

18:21.476 --> 18:24.688
You shouldn't even have to look at me.
I'm out of here.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.899
No, no, no, no!

18:30.360 --> 18:31.570
Don't look at me!

18:32.404 --> 18:34.072
Don't look at me.

18:35.866 --> 18:37.701
I'm worried about him.

18:38.452 --> 18:40.787
I've never seen him like this.

18:40.871 --> 18:46.376
Not even after I beat him at jumpy stick.
A game he invented, but I perfected.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.003
Well, should we hug him?

18:48.921 --> 18:51.006
I don't know if that's enough.

18:51.089 --> 18:54.551
Yeah, but I'm talking about
a real deal squeeze.

18:54.635 --> 18:57.095
What if the situation
was flipped and bipped?

18:57.179 --> 18:59.556
-What would Gobo say to us?
-Yeah.

18:59.640 --> 19:03.727
Well, he'd remind us
that things can be good.

19:03.810 --> 19:04.811
Yeah.

19:04.895 --> 19:07.523
And that we're not
defined by our mistakes,

19:07.606 --> 19:10.526
but how we come together
to make things better.

19:10.609 --> 19:13.403
-Yeah.
-And that together we can do anything.

19:13.987 --> 19:17.824
I'm speaking as Gobo. I think
it's a little more nuanced than that.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.245
-And then he'd sing.
-Yeah.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.456
You're right. I would.

19:27.876 --> 19:31.755
We've got to learn to live together

19:33.340 --> 19:36.426
Don't let your neighbor fall apart

19:37.302 --> 19:38.303
Huh?

19:38.387 --> 19:41.974
We got to welcome stormy weather

19:43.976 --> 19:47.563
With every brave and beating heart

19:48.730 --> 19:53.694
-So give us love and give us longing
-Ooh, ooh

19:54.194 --> 19:58.574
-Ooh, ooh
-It's everything we'll ever need

19:58.657 --> 20:00.868
'Cause you and me

20:00.951 --> 20:02.578
We all have one heart

20:02.661 --> 20:06.915
We all have one journey
That brings us together

20:06.999 --> 20:09.209
And shows us the light

20:09.293 --> 20:10.878
We all have a path

20:10.961 --> 20:14.965
We all have a story
That goes on forever

20:15.048 --> 20:17.801
We all have one heart
Have one heart

20:17.885 --> 20:21.180
And I'm here no matter the weather

20:21.263 --> 20:24.474
I'm standing on the edge of before

20:26.059 --> 20:29.813
If it's dark
Just know that wherever you are

20:29.897 --> 20:33.400
There's a light in your heart

20:33.483 --> 20:34.526
So…

20:34.610 --> 20:36.820
Give us love and give us longing

20:36.904 --> 20:38.322
Junior Junior!

20:38.405 --> 20:42.034
-It's everything we'll ever need
-The Fraggle music woke you up.

20:42.117 --> 20:43.869
We all have one heart

20:43.952 --> 20:46.371
-We all have one journey
-I know what to do.

20:46.455 --> 20:48.040
That brings us together

20:48.123 --> 20:50.501
-And shows us the light
-Thank you, Fraggles!

20:50.584 --> 20:52.169
We all have a path

20:52.252 --> 20:56.465
We all have a story
That goes on forever

20:56.548 --> 20:58.926
We all have one heart

20:59.009 --> 21:02.763
When we're together
We don't need to fuss

21:02.846 --> 21:09.102
'Cause making some magic
Takes all of us

21:09.186 --> 21:11.146
-Did that come out of me?
-Yeah.

21:11.230 --> 21:12.898
We all have one heart

21:12.981 --> 21:17.194
We all have one journey
That brings us together

21:17.277 --> 21:19.446
And shows us the light

21:19.530 --> 21:21.073
We all have a path

21:21.156 --> 21:25.327
We all have a story
That goes on forever

21:25.410 --> 21:28.247
-We all have one heart
-Have one heart

21:28.330 --> 21:31.500
Oh whoa, ooh whoa

21:34.586 --> 21:37.089
Junior! My fountain!

21:37.172 --> 21:38.298
What are you doing?

21:38.382 --> 21:41.593
The right thing, Pa.
This water belongs to all of us.

21:44.972 --> 21:48.475
Oh whoa, ooh whoa

21:49.101 --> 21:52.312
Oh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa

21:56.149 --> 21:57.484
All of us!

22:00.904 --> 22:05.033
-That rock fixed it. Yay!
-The water's diverting.

22:06.869 --> 22:09.121
The Fraggles did it!

22:10.414 --> 22:12.374
The Craggles can come home.

22:19.798 --> 22:21.800
There's water for all of us.

22:27.014 --> 22:29.183
-Water's back.
-Power's back.

22:29.266 --> 22:30.350
Work's back.

22:30.434 --> 22:31.810
Hooray!

22:31.894 --> 22:33.979
We saved Craggle Lagoon!

22:34.062 --> 22:36.190
-We did it!
-Craggle Lagoon is filled!

22:36.273 --> 22:37.482
Thanks, Junior.

22:37.566 --> 22:39.401
You're welcome, you're welcome!

22:39.484 --> 22:41.195
That's our water!

22:41.904 --> 22:45.657
Pa, we have plenty for all of us.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.993
But we're Gorgs.

22:48.660 --> 22:49.995
Pipe down.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.206
-He's a good boy.
-Yeah!

22:52.915 --> 22:57.961
Power should be online in three, two…

22:58.462 --> 23:00.255
now, Sprocket!

23:00.339 --> 23:02.382
Quick, hit record on the tank camera.

23:03.675 --> 23:05.844
Sprocket, please!

23:09.431 --> 23:11.266
Goodbye, hairy creature.

23:15.479 --> 23:18.273
Thank you, hairy beast.
What a lovely gift for me.

23:18.815 --> 23:20.442
What a fascinating artifact.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.785
It's working, Sprocket.

23:30.869 --> 23:32.371
Munchie came through.

23:33.288 --> 23:34.873
And so did you, buddy.

23:35.374 --> 23:36.375
Come here.

23:36.917 --> 23:37.918
Hooray!

23:38.001 --> 23:40.462
-That's wonderful.
-I love a happy ending.

23:40.546 --> 23:41.755
-Me too.
-Yeah.

23:41.839 --> 23:43.423
-We did it!
-Yeah.

23:43.507 --> 23:46.343
-Well, thanks, Junior.
-Thank you, Gobo.

23:46.426 --> 23:47.970
-Thanks a lot.
-Thank you a lot.

23:48.053 --> 23:50.305
-Really appreciate it.
-I really appreciate you.

23:50.389 --> 23:52.432
-I'll see you around.
-I hope so.

23:52.516 --> 23:54.393
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.311
-Well--
-Guys, let's go.

23:56.395 --> 23:57.813
See you soon.

23:58.856 --> 24:00.691
We all have one heart

24:00.774 --> 24:05.112
We all have one journey
That brings us together

24:05.195 --> 24:07.155
And shows us the light

24:07.239 --> 24:08.866
We all have a path

24:08.949 --> 24:13.161
We all have a story
That goes on forever

24:13.245 --> 24:17.916
We all have one heart
Have one heart

24:19.459 --> 24:22.588
Thank you. Wow.
What a wonderful welcome.

24:22.671 --> 24:24.798
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!

24:26.592 --> 24:30.345
Do you realize that we just grew
plastic-eating bacteria

24:30.429 --> 24:34.433
in a home lab using solar power,
and we documented the whole thing?

24:35.601 --> 24:39.563
Didn't I tell you when we moved in here
that we were gonna change the world?

24:42.691 --> 24:44.526
I wonder what we'll discover next.

24:49.615 --> 24:53.702
So, Uncle Matt, we filled your museum
with objects from everywhere.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.538
There's a Craggle cloak.

24:57.789 --> 25:00.375
And a Merggle shell headband.

25:00.459 --> 25:02.336
Yeah, and Doozer blueprints.

25:02.419 --> 25:05.005
They're not blue,
that's just what they call them.

25:05.088 --> 25:08.050
Yes, those are on loan.
We're going to need them back.

25:08.133 --> 25:10.552
And a piece of the Gorgs' fountain.

25:10.636 --> 25:13.388
Which no one would let me properly clean.

25:13.472 --> 25:17.601
You see-- Well, we wanted to fill
this place with things that symbolize

25:17.684 --> 25:20.270
how we all came together
when we needed it most.

25:20.354 --> 25:22.981
We know it's not your original vision
for the museum,

25:23.065 --> 25:25.359
-but it's awfully important to us.
-Yeah.

25:26.360 --> 25:27.444
Well, this…

25:33.617 --> 25:37.412
…was my vision all along.
I'm just glad you finally got it right.

25:37.496 --> 25:39.831
Yeah!

25:40.415 --> 25:43.001
And I have one more artifact
to contribute.

25:43.627 --> 25:44.628
Oh, boy.

25:44.711 --> 25:45.712
Behold.

25:46.421 --> 25:47.714
What's that, Uncle Matt?

25:47.798 --> 25:49.591
Well, isn't it obvious?

25:49.675 --> 25:50.676
It's a--

25:53.554 --> 25:54.888
Lookie cookie.

25:56.682 --> 25:59.393
You lookie into it, and you get a cookie.

26:00.185 --> 26:02.479
Yeah. That makes sense, yeah.

26:03.188 --> 26:04.314
Wow.

26:05.482 --> 26:06.525
Wow.

26:07.818 --> 26:08.819
Cool.

26:11.446 --> 26:13.574
-When does the cookie happen?
-Yeah, when?

26:29.923 --> 26:31.675
We all have one heart

26:31.758 --> 26:35.971
We all have one journey
That brings us together

26:36.054 --> 26:37.973
And shows us the light

26:38.056 --> 26:39.933
We all have a path

26:40.017 --> 26:44.271
We all have a story
That goes on forever

26:44.354 --> 26:46.440
We all have one heart

26:46.523 --> 26:50.444
When we're together
We don't need to fuss

26:50.527 --> 26:56.742
'Cause making some magic
Takes all of us

26:56.825 --> 26:58.702
Did that come out of me?

26:58.785 --> 27:00.621
We all have one heart

27:00.704 --> 27:04.958
We all have one journey
That brings us together

27:05.042 --> 27:07.044
And shows us the light

27:07.127 --> 27:08.879
We all have a path

27:08.962 --> 27:13.258
We all have a story
That goes on forever

27:13.342 --> 27:16.345
We all have one heart
Have one heart

27:16.428 --> 27:19.598
Oh whoa, ooh whoa

27:20.265 --> 27:22.559
Oh, whoa

27:23.644 --> 27:25.437
We all have one heart

27:25.521 --> 27:29.733
We all have one journey
That brings us together

27:29.816 --> 27:31.944
And shows us the light

27:32.027 --> 27:33.779
We all have a path

27:33.862 --> 27:37.991
We all have a story
That goes on forever

27:38.075 --> 27:42.996
We all have one heart
Have one heart
