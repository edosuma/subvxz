00:09.000 --> 00:11.640
-Don't freak out, just relax!
-I'm freaking out.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.400
You're looking suspicious.
Calm down.

00:14.480 --> 00:17.359
If one of these pigs takes my wife,
I will kill them.

00:17.440 --> 00:22.120
Maria, down. I said down.
Put that Tecate box on her head.

00:22.920 --> 00:24.280
He's calling us.

00:25.800 --> 00:28.920
-Why are there so many dogs?
-They're looking for Al Qaedas.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.760
-Stop it.
-Let me pull the fuck up first.

00:35.640 --> 00:40.280
Hello. How are you, officer?
Probably want the passports.

00:41.439 --> 00:44.479
Just two passports
from two Americans.

00:47.799 --> 00:49.000
Destination?

00:49.640 --> 00:52.119
Shelby, North Carolina.
We're heading home.

00:52.200 --> 00:55.159
Heading to the hometown.
You bust any Soviets today?

00:55.759 --> 01:00.000
-Busting the commies?
-No. Nature of your visit?

01:00.840 --> 01:05.879
The visit in Mexico?
Mainly soul-searching.

01:06.400 --> 01:11.400
-What is that, drug talk?
-Vacation. It was a vacation trip.

01:12.200 --> 01:17.480
Went to Cabo Wabo, "Macha Piccos".
All the destinations in Mexico.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.799
Gonna need you
to pull the car over, sir.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.560
-Why?
-Because I'm gonna search it.

01:27.799 --> 01:30.480
I got a confession to make!

01:32.040 --> 01:35.159
I wanna come clean with this
so we can save some time.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.480
I got this, Stevie.

01:38.519 --> 01:40.480
I've been hiding something.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.200
-What are you hiding?
-This.

01:47.040 --> 01:50.200
-Check it. You recognize who I am?
-Nope.

01:53.079 --> 01:55.760
-What does that mean?
-Lock into the eyes.

01:57.519 --> 02:01.680
Take in the hair,
facial structural, features.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.480
-Excuse me?
-Kenny Powers.

02:06.560 --> 02:10.639
-The baseball player?
-The fucking baseball player.

02:11.479 --> 02:15.319
Kenny P. in the house.
The fuck out of here.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.719
-I'd love to get out of here.
-Can I get a picture?

02:19.199 --> 02:23.319
I gotta get a pic right now.
Can you say that catchphrase?

02:23.960 --> 02:26.439
You're fucking out.

02:26.919 --> 02:29.319
Ready?
You're fucking out.

02:32.240 --> 02:36.439
Here you go, guys.
Do you have any contact info?

02:36.759 --> 02:39.919
I do not. Thank you for keeping
the American border safe.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.599
You're fucking out of Mexico.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.840
Let me know
when you catch Bin Laden.

02:46.919 --> 02:49.599
-Will do, motherfucker.
-You bet.

02:51.319 --> 02:55.360
We're safe now, Maria.
Kenny's celebrity saved us.

02:55.439 --> 02:58.240
Feels good to be breaking
the laws in America again.

02:59.080 --> 03:02.439
EASTBOUND & DOWN
Series II, Episode 13

03:40.199 --> 03:42.400
That's the last of your shit.

03:42.719 --> 03:46.120
Can you just take that?
So it'll balance you out.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.960
Boo, could you give us a second?
Wait inside, please.

03:53.039 --> 03:56.520
That's yours too. Don't forget that.
There you go.

03:56.599 --> 04:02.520
-Very strong legs. Very sure-footed.
-My little mule. Fucking Shelby.

04:04.639 --> 04:08.000
We made it. Guess you're gonna go
fuck April now? Probably?

04:08.080 --> 04:13.479
Definitely. Maybe we'll start off slow
with a welcome-home blowjob.

04:14.159 --> 04:18.959
Light some candles,
heat up a fucking Lean Cuisine.

04:19.040 --> 04:24.160
Get sexy, huh?
It was amazing and I thank you.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.240
I don't think I could've done
what I did in Mexico

04:27.600 --> 04:32.399
without somebody there
to do all the rest of the shit.

04:33.079 --> 04:38.120
It's my job, man.
Give me some skin.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.639
-I'll see you around.
-Not if I see you first.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.360
Look! A penny!

04:52.360 --> 04:53.720
Adios, Stevie.

05:12.360 --> 05:15.920
Mi familia.
I've returned to you.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.000
If it isn't my favorite nephew!
How you doing, buddy?

05:21.360 --> 05:24.079
And the other nephew.
Look at you, Biggie Smalls.

05:24.639 --> 05:29.360
You've aged three years you. You got
some reverse Benjamin Button?

05:29.680 --> 05:34.120
-Wayne's normal.
-Of course. Get in here.

05:37.639 --> 05:40.160
Look at this one, huh?
Old sweet tits.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.800
Not nearly as heavy as you were
last time I saw you.

05:46.399 --> 05:50.639
That kissing on the cheek thing
is a custom I picked up abroad.

05:51.040 --> 05:54.040
Now when you say abroad,
does that mean Tampa or...

05:54.600 --> 05:57.480
Tampa didn't really pan
out the way I hoped it would.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.319
I decided to split
and head down to Mexico.

06:00.399 --> 06:03.879
I fought being the greatest gringo
that country's ever seen.

06:04.439 --> 06:08.079
I found our father and earned myself
a place on a baseball team.

06:09.240 --> 06:12.560
You found Pop?
Did he ask about me or...

06:14.360 --> 06:18.519
No, Dustin. I went down
there and searched for him.

06:18.600 --> 06:22.879
We're not gonna sit in Mexico talking
about somebody who's not there.

06:24.360 --> 06:27.519
-Whose birthday is it?
-It's Rose.

06:28.639 --> 06:31.839
-Your niece, Rose.
-Yeah, whatever.

06:32.600 --> 06:38.160
I gotta get a move on. I got a big
old pot of titties waiting for me.

06:38.240 --> 06:42.879
I need to go ahead and take a big
old shit in an American toilet.

06:44.399 --> 06:49.120
Give me some high fives.
Good to see your white faces.

06:56.720 --> 07:00.439
La escuela.
I mean school.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.680
Hop up, sweetheart.
Get out of here.

07:31.240 --> 07:35.560
Lunch kids! All you little
motherfuckers eating, put it down.

07:35.879 --> 07:41.199
I need all eyes up here.
Get this thing out of here.

07:41.920 --> 07:45.279
Do I have all the attentions
of everyone? Attention, please.

07:45.360 --> 07:49.800
For those of y'all who do not know
who I am, my name is Kenny Powers.

07:50.600 --> 07:54.439
And as fucked up as it may seem,
I used to be a teacher here.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.680
But now I return to you,
a victor, a champion,

07:59.040 --> 08:02.759
a man who has defeated the face
of Mexican baseball.

08:03.279 --> 08:08.759
Not to get back my old job.
But to capture the heart

08:09.199 --> 08:12.040
of one of your teachers
and take her away from you.

08:13.319 --> 08:19.279
Id like the beautiful, forgiving,
the talented, big-chested art teacher

08:20.160 --> 08:22.360
to please step forward.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.079
Where's she at?
Show me them big ol' titties.

08:29.720 --> 08:34.120
-I'm the art teacher.
-The fuck you are.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.720
Where's the real art teacher?

08:36.799 --> 08:41.200
-Kenny. What are you doing?
-I'm here to get April back.

08:41.279 --> 08:45.480
You're cursing for no reason, because
she doesn't work here anymore.

08:47.440 --> 08:48.919
Where the fuck is she?

08:49.759 --> 08:55.440
Why don't you take your feet out
of Clydes mashed potatoes

08:55.519 --> 08:59.480
and I will take you to see
her myself.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.240
Sorry if I fucked up your lunch.
My bad. Stay in school.

09:08.159 --> 09:11.080
Fight the power.
Don't do drugs.

09:11.159 --> 09:14.519
Unless you're doing them
with me.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.480
That's not funny.
Just come down, please.

09:17.559 --> 09:20.440
Fuck, it's school lunch.
Shit's like a buck 25.

09:25.159 --> 09:29.600
This Myrtle Beach thing,
it's different from Tampa, is it?

09:29.679 --> 09:34.919
-On the surface it sounds similar.
-Don't worry about my deals!

09:36.039 --> 09:40.399
Don't understand why April's playing
"flip this house."

09:41.279 --> 09:45.840
She gave it a pretty good go.
But her heart wasn't in teaching.

09:47.559 --> 09:51.320
There was a moment in time
I was in the pits and anus of Mexico.

09:51.399 --> 09:53.840
-Where is that?
-It's a town called Copales.

09:54.679 --> 09:59.279
I thought for a brief moment
that you two had gotten married.

10:01.480 --> 10:05.200
I was thinking what a mistake
that would've been for her.

10:05.519 --> 10:07.320
-For her.
-Terrible.

10:07.919 --> 10:13.480
Being that you already
had been there and it was destroyed.

10:13.559 --> 10:16.679
It would've been a compromise
to go back and be with you.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.639
It's kind of insulting, isn't it?
Just a little bit?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.960
I'm destiny.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.559
This is a wonderful outfit.
you've put together here.

10:28.919 --> 10:30.759
-What is it?
-La Flama Blanca.

10:30.840 --> 10:36.879
It's Spanish for "the White Flame."
I was pitching pure from the heart.

10:38.200 --> 10:42.879
But now it all climaxes here.
Crazy you're here to witness it.

10:43.759 --> 10:47.919
-Who would've guessed?
-I don't know.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.759
Watch as I win her back.

10:53.639 --> 10:56.360
There's actually one other
thing you should know.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.480
Let him find out.

11:00.720 --> 11:04.279
So this is it.
What do you think of the house?

11:05.000 --> 11:08.480
Since my hysterectomy I swore
I'd never get a place with stairs.

11:08.559 --> 11:13.960
This is the best floor plan
that I have ever seen.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.519
Or we could show you the 1.5
million place with an elevator.

11:22.159 --> 11:25.879
April? Your champion has
returned to reclaim his love.

11:26.200 --> 11:30.679
I stand before you as a man pure
of heart. Fuck, you're pregnant.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.639
-Fuck me.
-What are you doing in here, Kenny?

11:36.879 --> 11:39.320
I came back for you,
just like I promised.

11:39.639 --> 11:44.399
-You didn't promise.
-I came to mend things.

11:44.480 --> 11:47.279
-We could come back.
-No, you don't have to come back.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.679
-Who's the fucking dad?
-Hello, Jamie.

11:49.759 --> 11:53.200
-What's up, stalker?
-Who is this guy?

11:53.600 --> 11:59.799
Jamie is the smooth-talking
black gentleman who lured April away.

11:59.879 --> 12:02.559
-He did not lure me.
-Yes, he did.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.759
With promises of high commissions
and big percentages.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.440
Please, just stop.

12:07.519 --> 12:12.480
I've fucking figured it out here.
You being all coy.

12:12.559 --> 12:16.080
I never imagined shit
had gotten this dark.

12:16.440 --> 12:19.159
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You do the math.

12:19.240 --> 12:24.960
I've been through hell to find you've
made your bed with another man.

12:25.039 --> 12:28.799
Who the fuck do you think
you are? Honestly?

12:29.679 --> 12:31.720
Get out.

12:31.799 --> 12:38.120
Stay away from me because
I never wanna see your face again.

12:40.039 --> 12:42.639
-Do you not wanna see me for today?
-No, ever.

12:46.720 --> 12:51.840
-Get out.
-I wouldn't wanna ruin a sale!

12:52.639 --> 12:54.799
You gotta make commissions,

12:55.159 --> 13:00.159
to buy FUBU
and the Osh Kosh B'Gosh.

13:01.120 --> 13:05.440
Potential home buyers, there were
a lot of rapes in this house.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.919
-Get out!
-I hope you disclosed that.

13:10.639 --> 13:12.120
Get out of here.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.919
There were no rapes here,
as far as I know.

13:48.960 --> 13:52.879
Goddamn. I didn't think
I was gonna be seeing you again.

13:53.639 --> 13:59.480
It's nice to know that when I hit
bottom, you'll always be here.

13:59.879 --> 14:02.240
-How was rehab?
-Great.

14:02.919 --> 14:05.480
Bunch of hottie heroin junkies...

14:05.919 --> 14:09.600
Why don't you get rid of that needle
and go straight for the dick?

14:10.120 --> 14:12.799
They got a few of them
pretty girls down in Mexico.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.679
Little Spanish caramel sirens.

14:17.159 --> 14:20.799
I was trying to save myself,
keep myself pure for April.

14:21.240 --> 14:24.559
Turns out she didn't have
the same fucking agenda.

14:24.879 --> 14:27.639
She's pregnant with
a black man's baby.

14:30.919 --> 14:34.279
But you were fucking
some other people, right?

14:34.360 --> 14:38.039
I basically fucked a whole entire
village full of Mexican women.

14:39.399 --> 14:41.399
Kenny fucking Powers.

14:41.960 --> 14:45.159
Last time I saw you,
I had a yeast infection.

14:46.240 --> 14:49.960
I'm all cleared up now. You miss me?
They got girls like me in Tampa?

14:51.120 --> 14:53.399
I'm sure they got sluts in Tampa.

14:53.480 --> 14:59.480
I went to Mexico on an epic spiritual
quest that ended in failure.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.840
You still got Myrtle Beach.

15:03.200 --> 15:07.639
The pavilion's closed and Myrtle
Beach ain't what it used to be.

15:08.519 --> 15:13.559
-Why are you dressed as Boss Hogg?
-I'm dressed like pure.

15:14.919 --> 15:18.639
Why don't you fuck off? Don't you got
somebody you gotta give AIDS to?

15:19.559 --> 15:23.720
If you're not doing anything
this summer,

15:23.799 --> 15:26.360
we get on the road
and we'll go hit some dates.

15:26.440 --> 15:31.799
Some JB and the Boys, Keller,
fucking Government Mule.

15:31.879 --> 15:35.559
Maybe get in some Psycho Toads.
That sound like a good idea?

15:35.639 --> 15:39.000
-Is this fucking Seger?
-It's definitely Seger.

15:42.080 --> 15:45.200
I gotta get out of here, Clegg.
I need to get some fucking air.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.759
Is it the blow?
This is pretty cheap shit.

15:58.840 --> 16:02.159
Excuse me. Can't listen to any
romantical shit right now.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.360
-We were listening.
-Not anymore.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.720
Kenny, have you been crying?

16:07.200 --> 16:10.559
-I'm not crying. Just lake water.
-What is the matter?

16:10.639 --> 16:15.840
-April's what's the matter.
-You've talked to her then?

16:16.320 --> 16:22.320
She cares about her new partner
and her unborn multicultural baby.

16:22.759 --> 16:24.879
-April's pregnant?
-That's big news.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.840
Good for her!

16:26.919 --> 16:31.159
That's fucking bad for her.
It's even worse for me.

16:32.799 --> 16:36.559
You think Mom should've waited
for Dad to come back around?

16:37.120 --> 16:40.919
Don't act like you're
the goddamn expert of father.

16:42.440 --> 16:46.320
Have you thought of saying sorry
to April and start from there?

16:46.960 --> 16:50.360
I cannot do that. It should be
her who's apologizing to me.

16:51.240 --> 16:53.679
I don't understand why
she would do this to me.

16:53.759 --> 16:56.559
Maybe because you left her
at a fucking gas station.

16:58.679 --> 17:03.039
If you really wanna do right by April
then leave her alone.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.079
Go to Myrtle.
Go and be a baseball player.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.160
That's what you've been
chasing your whole life.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.519
Maybe you're right, Dustin.
Guess I should just go be

17:14.599 --> 17:17.880
a cold, calculated
killing machine on the mound.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.039
Striking out idiots joylessly,
going through the motions

17:25.680 --> 17:28.000
because no one loves me
and my heart is dead.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.119
As they say in Mexico,
buenas noches.

18:42.640 --> 18:46.759
Maria? How long are your cousins
planning on staying here?

18:54.960 --> 18:58.279
It's just my fucking house.
I'll get the fucking door.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.680
-What's up?
-Thank God!

19:03.960 --> 19:08.759
Maria's cousins came over
and I don't think they're leaving.

19:09.279 --> 19:13.240
Get ahold of yourself!
I came here to bid you farewell.

19:13.640 --> 19:16.599
I'm starting a new life,
one where I'm gonna be alone.

19:17.440 --> 19:20.839
I'm fucking coming with you.
I'm not even gonna say goodbye.

19:20.920 --> 19:24.799
-You need to stay here with Maria.
-I think made a mistake.

19:24.880 --> 19:31.400
This is a pang's and curiosity love.
Always second guessing yourself

19:31.480 --> 19:34.799
but knowing at the core
it's the right thing to do.

19:35.480 --> 19:40.240
Kenny, I literally cannot talk to her
because she speaks another language.

19:40.319 --> 19:43.119
Love is the international
language.

19:43.519 --> 19:46.720
She has all her cousins in there.
I feel I'm being strangled

19:46.799 --> 19:50.759
by a bunch of Mexicans
on a necklace...

19:51.079 --> 19:55.279
That's love. Let it take hold and rip
out every last breath you have.

19:55.920 --> 19:59.640
It's better to be strangled
by a necklace of Mexicans

20:00.200 --> 20:02.480
than to be strangled
by no one at all.

20:05.880 --> 20:08.400
-Hola, Kenny.
-Hola, Maria.

20:09.880 --> 20:12.839
That's a nice T-shirt.
Because it's true.

20:13.839 --> 20:17.839
"Love is the best gift ever."

20:18.920 --> 20:22.079
I have one final favor
I need to ask of both of you.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.519
What is it?

20:27.839 --> 20:31.359
It's your book.
You finally finished it?

20:31.440 --> 20:36.319
You know what to do with this.
Do you know what to do with that?

20:37.200 --> 20:39.000
I know what to do with this.

20:39.079 --> 20:42.440
Just so that you don't ruin it,
what are you gonna do with it?

20:42.519 --> 20:45.599
-I'm going to listen to it?
-No, you're already wrong.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.039
-Give it to April.
-To April.

20:49.000 --> 20:54.200
This is truth. You live by that.
You die by that.

20:55.400 --> 20:59.880
Then you'll have a happy marriage.
Adios, you two crazy lovers.

21:05.400 --> 21:10.400
Thank you for coming.
Y'all have my card.

21:11.119 --> 21:15.200
That list price is just the start.
Our sellers are very motivated.

21:18.559 --> 21:21.519
Hi. Are you here
for the open house?

21:22.640 --> 21:26.359
-Tits grande?
-Yes.

21:28.039 --> 21:29.599
For you.

22:09.920 --> 22:13.640
Chapter One continued.
More of what I waw just saying.

22:15.440 --> 22:21.400
Never did I imagine myself
being in Mexico. Who would?

22:22.400 --> 22:25.759
Most Mexicans spend the bulk
of their day trying to get out.

22:25.839 --> 22:29.680
So you can hardly blame foreigners
for not thinking about getting in.

22:30.119 --> 22:33.279
The people aren't different
from ones back home

22:33.359 --> 22:37.640
when you get past
the lack of interest in real sports.

22:40.079 --> 22:45.039
When you see Mexicans
in the States you think,

22:45.119 --> 22:48.400
there's a group of Mexicans
doing Mexican things together.

22:49.039 --> 22:52.480
Here you see it's not just because
they talk the same language.

22:52.880 --> 22:57.839
Family means a lot.
Relationships, husbands, wives.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.000
Reminds me of why I'm here
in the first place.

23:02.079 --> 23:06.799
The quest is nothing if you got
no one to brag about it to.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.200
Me, I'm doing it for a girl I had
to leave behind to get this far.

23:12.799 --> 23:15.400
Now I gotta go a little further
to get back to her.

23:16.440 --> 23:19.559
All I can do is hope that
one day she'll understand,

23:19.640 --> 23:22.480
and it's not too late.

23:26.559 --> 23:29.599
Chapter Nothing,
the fucking epilogue.

23:31.680 --> 23:34.799
-You're really leaving already?
-Yes, Wayne.

23:35.240 --> 23:38.720
There's absolutely nothing
for me here in Shelby. So I'm out.

23:41.319 --> 23:44.279
I can't believe it,
but I think he's actually leaving.

23:47.400 --> 23:50.119
-How far away is Myrtle Beach?
-About four hours.

23:50.720 --> 23:55.079
-Can you get us fireworks?
-Not if you don't clean this Jet Ski.

23:55.480 --> 23:59.920
Get back to it. I can't go
with the most disgusting Jet Ski.

24:10.799 --> 24:13.519
-I listened to your tapes.
-You read my book?

24:15.359 --> 24:17.759
I appreciate how honest
you were in it.

24:18.079 --> 24:20.160
I took
some artistic license.

24:20.240 --> 24:23.119
The Vida parts.
I fucked her a handful of times.

24:25.440 --> 24:29.799
All the parts about doing everything
for you, that was true.

24:31.519 --> 24:35.160
-I have something to tell you.
-I have something to tell you too.

24:36.359 --> 24:39.839
I'm sorry, April.
I learned a lot down in Mexico.

24:41.279 --> 24:44.559
Sometimes to be the man,
you gotta beat the man.

24:45.599 --> 24:47.839
I learned the grass
is not always greener.

24:48.319 --> 24:51.880
I learned that adversity's
sweet milk is philosophy.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.079
The baby's yours.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.119
I don't need anything from you.
I don't expect anything.

25:05.039 --> 25:10.160
It's taken me some time
to accept the situation and be happy.

25:11.039 --> 25:13.680
But I am.

25:15.480 --> 25:19.440
I'm excited
to be a mama, Kenny.

25:23.799 --> 25:25.799
Are you gonna
say something or...

25:30.720 --> 25:36.160
-You're not making sense.
-Just process everything.

25:37.440 --> 25:40.200
I was actually planning
on splitting out of town.

25:40.279 --> 25:42.519
Got a job pitching down there.

25:42.920 --> 25:47.079
Of course you need time
to process this.

25:48.599 --> 25:51.079
That's okay.

26:00.440 --> 26:03.559
I don't have to leave right now.

26:04.880 --> 26:08.440
Theres a cool Mexican
place down the road.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.720
Has really awesome food,

26:10.799 --> 26:14.039
but the dacor is kind of shitty,
kind of like Mexico itself.

26:15.319 --> 26:20.839
I'm not interested in being
in love with you anymore.

26:24.079 --> 26:25.839
I get that.

26:28.359 --> 26:30.480
I've just come a long way.

26:31.039 --> 26:34.279
And I'd just like a chance
to catch up with you.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.200
Okay.

26:45.640 --> 26:48.480
All right, cool.
How about I drive?

26:48.839 --> 26:50.640
I'll follow you.

26:51.079 --> 26:55.079
I see why you would be wary of riding
with me. That's understandable.

26:55.160 --> 26:58.519
-So we'll just meet there?
-I'll meet you there.

27:02.759 --> 27:04.880
It's not the black guy's kid.
It's mine.

27:10.759 --> 27:14.400
Guys, come on, scram.
Jet Ski's clean. Get out of there.

28:08.160 --> 28:12.200
Subtitling
RADU VLADESCU

28:12.759 --> 28:16.039
