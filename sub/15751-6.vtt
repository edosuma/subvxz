hair when he comes?

a total name dropper.

No, no.

16:29.760 --> 16:30.110
Jeez.

16:30.110 --> 16:31.140
-You want a little peekaboo?

16:31.140 --> 16:31.840
JOSH: Hey, hey.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.310
I do not want to-- I
want to know, like,

16:33.310 --> 16:35.660
when you knew that
you were trans.

16:35.660 --> 16:36.750
You're trans, right?

16:36.750 --> 16:37.850
-Yes, honey.

16:37.850 --> 16:39.650
I'm all woman.

16:39.650 --> 16:43.380
And I've got a cock to prove it.

16:43.380 --> 16:45.610
Do you like to dress
up in women's clothes?

16:45.610 --> 16:46.310
-No.

16:46.310 --> 16:48.150
-You want me to fuck you?

16:48.150 --> 16:49.910
I could do that.

Let me-- let me show you around.

17:13.620 --> 17:14.590

17:14.590 --> 17:15.420
-Oh, it is a little--

17:15.420 --> 17:16.460
-It's really lovely.

17:16.460 --> 17:18.330

getting started.

17:18.330 --> 17:19.080
-I love it.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.000
-I hope you don't mind.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.940
It's just a few minor changes.

17:21.940 --> 17:22.880
-Oh, my.

17:22.880 --> 17:23.680
-Thank you for the wine.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.270
-I cannot believe
you left this place.

17:25.270 --> 17:27.100
-Oh, you-- you don't want
to live in the Palisades.

17:27.100 --> 17:30.970
They, uh-- they would chase
our kind out with a stick.

17:30.970 --> 17:32.990
They've only recently
started letting in the Jews.

17:32.990 --> 17:33.690

17:33.690 --> 17:34.980
MAURA: This is nice.

17:34.980 --> 17:36.550
Oh, you kept some of the books.

17:36.550 --> 17:37.530
-Yeah, yeah.

17:37.530 --> 17:38.660
No, I love books--

17:38.660 --> 17:39.390
MAURA: Me too.

17:39.390 --> 17:41.260
- --as-- as a design element.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.830
-That television is huge.

17:43.830 --> 17:44.750
Look at that.

17:44.750 --> 17:45.450

She's--

17:47.780 --> 17:48.610
-I love it.

17:48.610 --> 17:49.440
-I'm sorry, Dad.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.240
We just got-- I-- you know,
it's so fun for the kids--

17:51.240 --> 17:52.490
-Yeah, movie night!

17:52.490 --> 17:52.780
Yeah.

17:52.780 --> 17:53.730
-It's gonna be great.

17:53.730 --> 17:54.010
-Yeah.

17:54.010 --> 17:55.240
I know it's hard
to adjust to, like,

17:55.240 --> 17:56.440
not being able to
cover it up, but--

17:56.440 --> 17:57.330
MAURA: No, it's beautiful.
I love it.

17:57.330 --> 17:58.130
-Oh, thanks.

17:58.130 --> 17:59.400

Oh, bacon, wait a minute.

18:01.910 --> 18:04.200
Oh, no, no, no.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.120
There's children here!

18:06.120 --> 18:06.820
SARAH: Oh, Dad.

18:06.820 --> 18:07.400
This is Bianca.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.450
This is Tammy's stepdaughter.

18:08.450 --> 18:09.610
-Hi, Bianca.

18:09.610 --> 18:10.310
-Hi.

18:10.310 --> 18:11.040
MAURA: You are pretty.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.260
TAMMY: She's gorgeous.

18:12.260 --> 18:14.190
-Mommy told me you were magic.

18:14.190 --> 18:15.190
MAURA: I am magic.

18:15.190 --> 18:17.110
SARAH: Well, I-- I didn't--
I didn't say magic, exactly.

18:17.110 --> 18:18.610
I mean, I was trying to explain.
You know, just--

18:18.610 --> 18:19.780
MAURA: Explain?

18:19.780 --> 18:20.520
SARAH: Nothing.

18:20.520 --> 18:21.010
-I understand.

18:21.010 --> 18:22.090
TAMMY: Does anybody want drinks?

18:22.090 --> 18:22.320
-Yes.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.050
MAURA: Oh, yeah.

18:23.050 --> 18:24.970
-'Cause I could-- I could--
I could hook you up.

-OK.

18:25.550 --> 18:26.450
What-- what would you like?

18:26.450 --> 18:28.170
-Cup of anything, as long
as there's booze in it.

18:28.170 --> 18:28.870
TAMMY: All right.

18:28.870 --> 18:29.450
And?
-Vodka tonic.

18:29.450 --> 18:30.210
-OK.

18:30.210 --> 18:30.910
MAURA: Arnold Palmer.

18:30.910 --> 18:31.610
-OK.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.740
All right.

18:32.740 --> 18:36.450
RAQUEL: If we look at a map, the
promised land is actually not

18:36.450 --> 18:39.190
that far from where Moses lived.

18:39.190 --> 18:43.000
We'd be, like, from here
to, I don't know, Mexico.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.770
All right, not that far.

18:44.770 --> 18:47.370
But 40 years?

18:47.370 --> 18:50.110
No.

18:50.110 --> 18:52.290
Welcome.

18:52.290 --> 18:54.780
It's because God needed
that amount of time

18:54.780 --> 18:57.700
to change slaves
into free people.

18:57.700 --> 18:59.820
The previous
generation had to die.

18:59.820 --> 19:02.310
No one got in from
that generation.

19:02.310 --> 19:09.040
Only those that were born free
and were born in the wilderness

19:09.040 --> 19:10.390
that get to see
the promised land.

19:37.390 --> 19:38.380
What is that.
SARAH: A magazine.

19:38.380 --> 19:38.820
-Mindfulness.

want to do the honors?

I would love to help.
MAURA: No, you can't.

19:51.350 --> 19:52.150
SARAH: It's-- I'm sorry.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.880
It's the tradition that
the mother of the family

Grandpa Mort, Grandma Mort?

24:52.950 --> 24:54.620

This is all great, but it's
my tone? (SARCASTICALLY) Oh,

it's the register
of my vocal cords.

confusing everyone.
