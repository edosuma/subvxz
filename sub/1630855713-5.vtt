WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.008
[gentle music playing]

00:18.018 --> 00:19.019
[Kaia grunts]

00:19.561 --> 00:20.687
[Preacher] Hey.

00:20.770 --> 00:23.023
[groggily] Oh, you made me coffee already?

00:23.106 --> 00:26.776
-My hero.
-Oh, not just coffee.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.279
-This is café de olla.
-Mmm!

00:29.362 --> 00:33.199
It's Mexican coffee
made by brewing coffee in an olla,

00:33.283 --> 00:36.411
a ceramic jar, with cinnamon, piloncillo--

00:36.494 --> 00:39.873
Okay, we get it. You're fancy. [chuckling]

00:41.833 --> 00:44.627
Oh, that is some
black coffee magic right there.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.713
-[Preacher] Mmm?
-Mmm.

00:47.922 --> 00:49.466
You good at everything you do?

00:50.050 --> 00:51.009
You tell me.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.303
Come here.

00:56.347 --> 00:58.349
[phone ringing loudly]

00:59.100 --> 01:00.310
What's that?

01:00.894 --> 01:04.647
[Kaia] Special ringtone for the Chief
so I answer even on my day off.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.024
Hey, Chief, what's up?

01:06.107 --> 01:07.484
[amber alert ringing]

01:07.567 --> 01:09.527
[Kaia] Okay. Yeah, I'll be right there.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.784
Hey. Are we in trouble here?

01:15.867 --> 01:18.453
The wind's picking up,
so he needs me to come in,

01:18.536 --> 01:20.663
but fire's still on the outskirts of town.

01:20.747 --> 01:24.084
Even if it gets close, everybody
on this side of the river should be fine.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.169
I will be back

01:27.796 --> 01:29.130
to finish that coffee.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.470
[pensive music playing]

01:36.513 --> 01:39.099
-[Jack] Are you sure the town is safe?
-[Preacher on phone] For now.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.059
But all the roads
to Clear River are blocked.

01:41.142 --> 01:44.270
[Jack] All right, we're on our way back.
I'll be there as soon as I can, Preach.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.400
Has there been a fire
in Virgin River before?

01:49.484 --> 01:51.820
Well, only one since I got here.

01:51.903 --> 01:56.116
It wasn't too bad, but it got close enough
to give everybody a good scare.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.868
Hope came up with
a fire readiness plan after.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.703
Staggered evacuation zones,

02:00.787 --> 02:02.997
shelter in the elementary school.

02:03.581 --> 02:06.376
The bar's the central command station
because it's close to the river.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.169
So we should probably head straight there.

02:08.253 --> 02:11.214
No, I don't want to go to the bar,
I wanna go to the clinic.

02:11.297 --> 02:15.135
With the roads closed to Clear River,
there's gonna be an influx of patients.

02:15.218 --> 02:17.637
Doc and Cameron are gonna need
all the help they can get.

02:18.429 --> 02:19.305
You got it.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.405
[uplifting music playing]

02:53.214 --> 02:54.424
[Amelia] Morning, sweetheart.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.259
Morning.

02:56.342 --> 02:57.260
Did you sleep?

02:57.844 --> 02:59.179
Not really.

02:59.262 --> 03:02.473
I can tell.
I have a fantastic new eye cream.

03:02.557 --> 03:03.933
I don't need eye cream.

03:04.726 --> 03:08.313
I just thought you'd like
to look your best for your big day.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.275
I'm not going to a job interview, Mom.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.402
Just testifying in a criminal case.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.905
[laughs] And I should get ready.

03:16.988 --> 03:20.241
Brie, I didn't mean
whatever you thought I meant.

03:22.285 --> 03:27.081
I know it's hard. You just have to
get through today and it will all be over.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.626
-Yeah, I'm not sure that's true.
-Well, I am.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.252
And later, we can catch up.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.881
You can tell me all about
your new house, and your new job,

03:34.964 --> 03:37.800
and why Brady
suddenly decided not to come.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.053
Can we not?

03:40.929 --> 03:41.763
Mom…

03:42.347 --> 03:45.225
like you said,
just gotta get through today.

03:50.271 --> 03:53.608
We're gonna get you out of here
real soon. Be right back.

03:55.443 --> 03:56.611
-Hey, Jack.
-Hey.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.404
-[Muriel] Mel, so good to see you.
-Hi.

03:58.488 --> 04:02.325
We need help. Uh, Doc and Cameron
are tied up with patients.

04:02.408 --> 04:06.412
This family here, the father did not
want to come down from the camps,

04:06.496 --> 04:09.165
but the wife knows Doc, so she insisted.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.084
She said he inhaled a lot of smoke.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.127
-Okay. Yeah.
-Right, I'm gonna leave you to it.

04:13.211 --> 04:16.339
Mel, glad you're here.
Oh, and Jack. Can I talk to you outside?

04:16.422 --> 04:18.299
-Yeah, sure.
-[Mel] Bye.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.301
-[Muriel] You got this. Thanks, Mel.
-I got it.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.804
-Hey! How are you?
-[man grunts]

04:22.887 --> 04:26.724
My name is Mel, I'm a nurse practitioner.
I hear you inhaled a lot of smoke?

04:26.808 --> 04:28.685
Do you guys want to come over
and take a seat?

04:28.768 --> 04:30.645
Look, uh, I'm fine. [clears throat]

04:30.728 --> 04:33.231
Used to smoke a pack a day,
so it's nothing I can't handle.

04:33.314 --> 04:36.150
He said he felt like someone
was sitting on his chest.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.069
And his heart is still beating too fast.

04:38.152 --> 04:41.698
Well, that is typical
of prolonged smoke exposure,

04:41.781 --> 04:45.034
and the elevated heart rate is because
you're not getting enough oxygen.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.161
So your heart is having to work overtime

04:47.245 --> 04:50.164
to try to get as much of it
as it can through your body.

04:50.248 --> 04:53.543
I'm gonna put you on some
supplemental oxygen for a few hours

04:53.626 --> 04:56.004
and I'll check your heart rate
to make sure it comes down.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.715
-We can't afford anything--
-We don't have insurance.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.634
Well, you know what?
I'm a volunteer nurse here today,

05:01.718 --> 05:05.138
so my services are free,
and the oxygen will be on me.

05:05.722 --> 05:09.851
But I might have to charge you
for a lollipop.

05:09.934 --> 05:11.019
What flavors?

05:11.102 --> 05:13.021
I think we have all the flavors.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.105
Thank you.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.607
Things were getting
pretty scary for her up there.

05:16.691 --> 05:17.692
Yeah. No problem.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.279
Apparently, the smoke
is really bad up at the camps

05:21.362 --> 05:23.823
and folks are scared that
they're gonna face criminal charges

05:23.906 --> 05:25.742
or deportation if they leave.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.744
-What, do you want me to talk to them?
-Yeah.

05:27.827 --> 05:31.372
Most of them are good people
who've had their fair share of bad luck

05:31.456 --> 05:34.792
and I just want to make sure
they get the treatment that they need.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.253
But somebody needs to convince them.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.131
All right. Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

05:40.214 --> 05:41.841
You sure you know
your way around up there?

05:41.924 --> 05:43.926
It's gonna get mighty confusing
with all this smoke.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.137
No. Can't say I do, but…

05:46.888 --> 05:48.848
I think I know someone who does.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.896
Fire's close. We need to evacuate.

05:54.979 --> 05:58.649
Once my product's secure,
I'll follow Cal Fire's orders.

05:59.233 --> 06:02.028
-Where you moving it to anyway?
-None of your business.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.865
Yeah, right. What do you want me to do
with the lumberyard?

06:06.991 --> 06:07.909
Let it burn.

06:07.992 --> 06:09.660
Collect the insurance.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.372
I'll be in touch once the smoke clears.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.916
-[sirens wailing faintly]
-[indistinct chatter]

06:16.417 --> 06:18.419
[somber music playing]

06:39.107 --> 06:40.191
Hey, what's up?

06:40.274 --> 06:42.151
I'm gonna need some help
evacuating the camps.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.820
Doc says people are refusing to leave.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.613
Think you can help
talk some sense into 'em?

06:45.696 --> 06:49.200
Yeah, sure, but I can't make any promises.
I'll follow you up in one of the trucks.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.411
-All right, I'll meet you at the gate.
-Yeah.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.580
Send everyone home, okay?
Be with their families.

06:54.664 --> 06:57.583
It ain't safe here anymore.
Put on the sprinklers before you go.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.753
[somber music continues]

07:09.220 --> 07:11.639
[reporter on TV] It's day seven
and the Grace Valley wildfires…

07:11.722 --> 07:14.016
[Hope] I know you're not
in the evacuation zone, Lydie,

07:14.100 --> 07:16.644
but you're on the same side
of the river as the fire.

07:16.727 --> 07:19.897
And I would feel better if you came
over to this side of the river.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.858
I appreciate your concern, Hope.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.193
But I already spoke with Nick,

07:24.277 --> 07:27.488
and he told me that
we need to keep the roads clear

07:27.572 --> 07:31.534
so that the people
who need to get out fast can get out.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.494
Oh, that's what Nick said.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.955
Did Nick draft the Fire Readiness Plan?

07:36.038 --> 07:37.039
No, I did.

07:37.123 --> 07:40.960
And I made it clear that the elderly
and disabled should be evacuated

07:41.043 --> 07:43.045
as early as possible.

07:43.129 --> 07:46.132
Just because I said
that I enjoyed getting older

07:46.215 --> 07:49.177
doesn't mean that I want
to be thought of as elderly.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.304
Better than being thought of
in the past tense

07:51.387 --> 07:54.223
because you stayed put
and roasted like a marshmallow.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.185
My goodness, Hope, are you really
that worried about me?

07:57.268 --> 07:59.645
Yes, Lydie, I am!

07:59.729 --> 08:04.859
Well, then, I suppose one more car
on the road couldn't hurt.

08:04.942 --> 08:07.945
I'll pack up a few things
and head on over.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.614
[sighs] Good. Goodbye.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.200
[scoffs] I can't believe him.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.701
-Believe who?
-Nick!

08:13.784 --> 08:15.745
He's ignoring my Fire Readiness Plan.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.789
I may not be at the top of my game now,
but I was when I wrote it.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.082
Why would he ignore your plan?

08:20.166 --> 08:22.502
I don't know,
but I'm gonna demand an answer.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.463
He better be using Jack's Bar
as Central Command.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.173
Why don't Denny and I take you?

08:27.256 --> 08:28.883
Getting behind the wheel
with intense anger

08:28.966 --> 08:31.719
and a traumatic brain injury might count
as driving under the influence.

08:31.802 --> 08:32.803
[Hope] Suit yourselves!

08:35.473 --> 08:37.475
[soft music playing]

08:40.144 --> 08:41.729
[woman] How long is the recess?

08:42.271 --> 08:44.273
[indistinct chatter in background]

08:48.778 --> 08:50.488
Nice to see you again, Brie.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.365
[dark music playing]

09:18.516 --> 09:20.268
[exhales and clears throat]

09:20.351 --> 09:23.354
-[sirens wailing faintly]
-[indistinct radio chatter]

09:26.274 --> 09:27.441
[Hope] Excuse me, Nick.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.945
[Nick] On behalf of everybody
in Virgin River, Chief,

09:31.028 --> 09:34.073
I just want to thank you
for all that Cal Fire's doing for us.

09:34.156 --> 09:35.408
We'll do as much as we can,

09:35.491 --> 09:37.660
but we're gonna need
all the help we can get.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.412
Starting with organizing
teams of volunteers

09:39.495 --> 09:40.955
to help the sheriff with evacuations.

09:41.038 --> 09:44.709
Yeah, Preacher served two tours in Iraq.
Maybe he could help coordinate?

09:44.792 --> 09:46.586
Yeah! Yeah, I'm happy to help, sir.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.879
My man will give you a map,
help you get started.

09:48.963 --> 09:51.465
-You bet.
-Excuse me, Nick, may I have a word?

09:51.549 --> 09:52.967
Sure, Hope. What can I do for you?

09:53.050 --> 09:55.803
You can tell me why
you aren't following our fire plan

09:55.886 --> 09:58.598
that calls for an evacuation
of the elderly and disabled

09:58.681 --> 09:59.932
from all zones.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.810
Hope, I'm doing what Cal Fire says.

10:02.893 --> 10:05.980
Chief Smith is far better equipped
to handle the situation than I am.

10:06.063 --> 10:09.233
But you're the mayor of this town now.
You can't be passive.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.528
Your residents who aren't protected
by the river are sitting ducks.

10:12.612 --> 10:16.365
I know! And, Hope, I promise
I'm not gonna let anything happen to them.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.744
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a crisis to manage.

10:20.703 --> 10:24.290
Ugh! This is so frustrating!
All I'm trying to do is help!

10:24.373 --> 10:25.583
[Preacher] Maybe you still can.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.794
Now, the chief put me in control
of organizing all the volunteers,

10:28.878 --> 10:31.714
so I see no reason
why we can't send a few extras

10:31.797 --> 10:34.425
to check on Virgin River's
most vulnerable citizens.

10:34.508 --> 10:37.803
-We'll volunteer. Where can we go?
-Thank you, all.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.348
Um, since we know Lydie's headed this way,

10:40.431 --> 10:42.808
why don't you go out to Bert's
and make sure he left?

10:42.892 --> 10:44.143
I spoke to Shirley.

10:44.226 --> 10:47.271
She's at her mother's in Montana,
but she can't reach him and neither can I.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.523
-What about Aunt Connie?
-[Hope] Oh, I spoke to her!

10:49.607 --> 10:52.151
She's at the elementary school
helping out with evacuees.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.569
She'll meet us later.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.280
Okay, well, for now,
the way to Bert's seems clear.

10:56.364 --> 11:00.242
So as long as you stay on Ox Yoke Drive,
it should be an easy trip out and back.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.619
You can count on us.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.412
Thank you.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.206
[man on radio] Mayday, mayday.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.755
Firefighter, identify yourself
and state your emergency.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.299
This is Davis.
We have two firefighters down.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.885
One with an impalement.
Possible internal bleeding.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.929
Second with minor injuries.
Unable to extricate.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.639
Requesting immediate medical assistance.

11:21.722 --> 11:26.936
Latitude, 40.7 north.
Longitude, 123.86 west.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.857
Stay put, Davis. Help is on the way.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.947
It's right there.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.866
Road to that location's cut off.
I can't get an ambulance out there.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.370
Chief Smith, Dr. Mullins should have
a straight shot from his clinic.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.996
Hope, I'm sure the chief can handle--

11:46.080 --> 11:47.039
Make the call.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.750
Any chance you know the name
of those injured firefighters?

11:49.834 --> 11:52.461
You know as much as I do. Why?

11:52.545 --> 11:54.213
Just worried about a friend.

11:56.674 --> 12:00.428
If Vernon is on the way,
whoever they are will be in good hands.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.766
[Mel] Okay, one more nice, deep breath.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.229
Great.

12:11.021 --> 12:13.524
All right, well, your lungs are clear.

12:13.607 --> 12:16.193
Your heart rate is back down,
so you're good to go.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.447
There is a shelter
at the elementary school.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.449
I'm gonna send you
with this rescue inhaler

12:21.532 --> 12:24.368
just in case you experience
any more shortness of breath.

12:24.452 --> 12:27.955
And you know what? I think I need
to prescribe you another lollipop.

12:28.622 --> 12:30.291
-[laughs]
-Thank you so much, Mel.

12:30.374 --> 12:31.292
You're welcome.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.085
Bye.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.298
-Bye.
-Thank you.

12:37.381 --> 12:38.215
Yeah.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.218
Oh, good. Uh, we have a new patient.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.179
Minor burn on his left hand.

12:43.262 --> 12:46.432
All right. Uh, apply a cool,
wet compress and I will be right back.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.768
-I have to run to the restroom. Thanks.
-Yeah.

12:57.234 --> 12:59.236
[somber music playing]

13:18.506 --> 13:22.593
Could you start by telling the court your
name and relationship to the defendant?

13:22.676 --> 13:25.554
My name is Brie Sheridan,
and the defendant is my rapist.

13:25.638 --> 13:26.764
Objection, Your Honor.

13:26.847 --> 13:27.848
[lawyer] On what grounds?

13:27.932 --> 13:31.352
All of them.
Assumes facts not in evidence, for one.

13:31.435 --> 13:32.686
[judge] Sustained.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.314
The jury will ignore that last statement.

13:35.397 --> 13:39.235
Sheridan, I know you're also an attorney,
so you should know better.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.237
Won't happen again, I'm sure.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.072
It won't, Your Honor.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.076
Don is my ex-boyfriend.

13:47.159 --> 13:50.371
Will you please tell the jury
what happened on the night of May 10th?

13:50.454 --> 13:52.581
Well, Don made us dinner.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.542
We had a glass of wine.

13:55.709 --> 13:59.630
Watched some Dancing With The Stars,
and then he sexually assaulted me.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.549
-Your Honor!
-Ms. Richardson.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.301
Do you need a moment
to talk to your witness?

14:04.385 --> 14:06.679
No, Your Honor.
We called Ms. Sheridan to testify

14:06.762 --> 14:10.140
as to what happened between herself
and the defendant that night.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.309
The defense's whole case rests on the fact

14:12.393 --> 14:15.229
that the incident in question
was a miscommunication.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.272
A mistake.

14:16.772 --> 14:19.441
But Ms. Sheridan's testimony
will show intent.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.610
The defendant knew exactly
what he was doing,

14:21.694 --> 14:24.154
and he acted similarly
with the witnesses here today.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.449
I'll allow it, but on the grounds

14:27.533 --> 14:30.536
that you don't categorize
the incident yourself, Ms. Sheridan.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.582
That's for the jury to decide.
Your job is to tell us what happened.

14:34.665 --> 14:37.459
Nothing more, nothing less.
Do you think you can do that?

14:37.543 --> 14:38.627
I can, Your Honor.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.671
Then you may proceed.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.175
Can you share the facts of what happened
between you and the defendant

14:45.259 --> 14:47.219
after you finished watching TV that night?

14:48.429 --> 14:50.431
[tense music playing]

15:01.525 --> 15:02.526
[clears throat]

15:04.945 --> 15:06.196
-Hey, Mel.
-Hey.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.114
You okay?

15:08.407 --> 15:11.201
[sighs] Yeah, I think I'm just
really tired from the morning rush.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.579
-[Doc] Yeah.
-How are you? Are you okay?

15:13.662 --> 15:15.831
Yeah, there's a firefighter
who's been impaled.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.876
I need to see if it's safe to move them
and I wanna bring Cameron with me

15:18.959 --> 15:19.960
in case I need help.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.296
-You okay to hold down the fort?
-Absolutely. Yeah.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.340
-We'll be back as soon as we can.
-Okay.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.635
-[Muriel] Hey, Mel?
-Yeah.

15:27.718 --> 15:32.139
We have more patients out there.
Mostly minor burns and smoke inhalation.

15:32.222 --> 15:35.809
Okay, can you do their intakes for me?
Just rank them from most to least severe.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.019
Yeah, I can do that.

15:37.102 --> 15:40.064
I had an under-five role
as a nurse on General Hospital,

15:40.147 --> 15:42.733
so you don't need to worry about a thing.

15:42.816 --> 15:43.943
[Mel softly] Okay.

15:50.824 --> 15:51.825
[clears throat]

15:54.203 --> 15:55.996
-[exhales]
-[jeans unzipping]

15:56.080 --> 15:58.082
[bittersweet music playing]

16:28.696 --> 16:31.699
-[crying softly]
-[bittersweet music continues]

17:22.666 --> 17:23.876
[exhales] Okay.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.379
-[bittersweet music continues softly]
-[clears throat]

17:28.130 --> 17:29.214
Okay.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.972
[indistinct clamoring]

17:45.647 --> 17:48.901
-[Brady] This ain't gonna be easy.
-[Jack] Yeah, I might need some backup.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.028
-[Brady] Good luck.
-[men coughing]

17:51.779 --> 17:53.238
[Jack] All right, listen up!

17:54.114 --> 17:58.952
Now, I know most of you don't want to,
but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

17:59.036 --> 18:02.498
All right? This camp is now
in a mandatory evacuation zone.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.375
This camp is all we got, man.
We can't just leave.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.087
Listen, I get it.
But this fire is on your doorstep.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.881
You're not safe here.
You'll be safe in Virgin River.

18:10.964 --> 18:12.591
No, we won't. Don't believe him.

18:12.674 --> 18:15.719
Hey, then believe me.
Come on, Frank. You know me.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.347
I had your back with Calvin
and I have it now.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.809
I would never ask anyone to leave
unless you absolutely had to.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.393
You got my word. You got Jack's too.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.853
-[explosion]
-[people exclaiming]

18:24.937 --> 18:26.605
We gotta go! Now!

18:27.523 --> 18:29.441
[Frank] All right, everybody,
get into the truck.

18:29.525 --> 18:32.736
Grab your stuff!
Just what you need! Now! Let's go!

18:34.113 --> 18:36.115
[sirens wailing faintly]

18:38.242 --> 18:40.828
-Okay, just take some deep breaths.
-[phone ringing]

18:42.204 --> 18:43.205
Ugh.

18:43.288 --> 18:46.750
Muriel? Oh, hi. Sorry.
Were you here the whole time?

18:46.834 --> 18:49.378
A good actress
is always waiting in the wings.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.921
-What do you need?
-Um, sorry.

18:51.004 --> 18:55.175
Um, can you make sure that the nebulizer
stays over his nose and mouth

18:55.259 --> 18:58.512
and that you see mist filling up
in the bottom in between breaths?

18:58.595 --> 19:00.764
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay. I'll be right back.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.724
Okay. [sighs]

19:03.225 --> 19:04.685
-Hey, Ava.
-[Ava] Hey, Mel.

19:04.768 --> 19:07.521
Looks like I chose
the wrong time to visit Virgin River.

19:07.604 --> 19:09.857
I know. The fire is really scary.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.610
Um, are you at the farm? Are you okay?

19:13.694 --> 19:14.945
Yeah, I'm here.

19:15.028 --> 19:18.740
I'm watching Chloe for a few days
while Tara's in San Francisco.

19:18.824 --> 19:22.619
But I think I'm more cut out to be
"fun aunt" than "caretaker in a crisis."

19:22.703 --> 19:26.623
I wasn't told to evacuate,
but there's a lot of smoke outside.

19:26.707 --> 19:27.958
You were right to call.

19:28.041 --> 19:31.295
Smoke can be really dangerous for babies
even if you can't see it in the house.

19:31.378 --> 19:34.548
If the roads are clear, can you bring her
to the clinic for a checkup?

19:34.631 --> 19:36.550
That'll put both of our minds at ease.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.719
Will do. I'll be there in 30.

19:38.802 --> 19:40.512
-Okay. I'll be waiting.
-Thanks, Mel.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.973
You're clearly more cut out
to be a mother than I am.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.517
-See you soon.
-Yeah.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.896
-Bye.
-[bittersweet music playing]

19:49.855 --> 19:50.856
[Muriel] Mel.

19:50.939 --> 19:52.316
It stopped misting.

19:52.399 --> 19:53.567
Okay.

19:53.650 --> 19:56.820
[Preacher] All right, so let's rendezvous
after an hour, head back as a unit.

19:56.904 --> 19:57.779
Be safe.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.867
Okay, it looks like we got volunteers out

20:01.950 --> 20:04.161
to all of the homes
you wanted to evacuate early.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.455
[sighs] Thanks again, Preacher.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.791
It's nice to know people outside
the sewing circle still believe in me.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.878
Hey, you are a warrior
for this town, Hope.

20:12.961 --> 20:16.298
And when warriors get wounded,
we rally around them.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.717
-I appreciate that.
-Of course.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.636
Everything's gonna be okay.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.804
Nick can't screw this up too badly.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.557
You sure about that?

20:28.560 --> 20:30.938
Any updates on the firefighter?

20:31.021 --> 20:35.192
Nothing yet, but I haven't pushed.
I don't want to annoy Chief Smith.

20:35.943 --> 20:40.697
Well, I'm happy to annoy Nick…
if you make me something to eat.

20:41.281 --> 20:43.158
-Got yourself a deal.
-[Hope chuckles]

20:48.330 --> 20:49.248
[Doc] Hey.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.208
[man] Two firefighters
were on this rock face

20:51.291 --> 20:54.169
trying to get a better angle
on the blaze when a tree fell,

20:54.253 --> 20:56.755
forcing them both
to jump at the last second.

20:56.838 --> 20:59.883
[Kaia] All right, just breathe.
You're gonna be fine. The docs are here.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.176
Hey, this is Jay.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.553
Jay, I'm Dr. Mullins.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.264
-This is Dr. Hayek.
-[Cameron] Hey.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.391
You're, uh… You're Cameron, right?

21:07.474 --> 21:09.309
-Yeah!
-You two know each other?

21:09.393 --> 21:12.437
Mel and I helped Kaia deliver a baby
on FaceTime a few days ago.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.480
How you feeling, Jay?

21:13.563 --> 21:16.066
Like there's a giant piece of wood
sticking out of my leg.

21:16.149 --> 21:17.943
Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

21:18.026 --> 21:20.779
but there is a giant piece of wood
sticking out of your leg.

21:20.862 --> 21:22.823
[laughs] Please don't make me laugh, Doc.

21:22.906 --> 21:23.865
-It really hurts.
-Noted.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.994
Laughter isn't always the best medicine,
but I'm glad you're in good spirits.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.037
[Jay] All things considered, um,

21:29.121 --> 21:31.957
Kaia said there isn't enough clearance
to cut me free here, so…

21:32.541 --> 21:34.001
[groans] So, what's the plan?

21:37.879 --> 21:39.506
You guys do have a plan, right?

21:39.589 --> 21:40.924
[dramatic music playing]

21:43.552 --> 21:45.554
[sirens wailing faintly]

21:48.598 --> 21:49.516
[Lizzie] Stop.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.353
-Why is Lydie still here?
-No idea.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.814
Didn't Hope tell her
to get out of here a while ago?

21:59.860 --> 22:00.944
[Lizzie] Lydie.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.112
Lydie?

22:02.696 --> 22:04.031
What are you two doing out here?

22:04.114 --> 22:06.325
We came to check on Bert,
but saw you in your driveway.

22:06.408 --> 22:07.993
You were supposed to be in town by now.

22:08.076 --> 22:09.995
I just have a few more boxes to load,

22:10.078 --> 22:12.331
and if you two could help,
I'll be done in a jiff.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.541
Lydie, I think you have
enough stuff already.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.376
It's getting bad out there. We need to go.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.879
Not until I have everything in the car.
Uh…

22:19.379 --> 22:21.798
This is all I have left of Herb and Ricky.

22:21.882 --> 22:25.010
Ricky isn't dead.
He's at basic training in San Diego.

22:25.093 --> 22:28.638
What if he doesn't come back?
Something could happen. Accidents happen.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.600
-He could get deployed--
-Lydie, Ricky is coming back.

22:31.683 --> 22:35.187
And I know how much you miss him
because I miss him too.

22:35.896 --> 22:39.733
But I also know that Ricky wouldn't want
you risking your life over memorabilia.

22:39.816 --> 22:42.110
Your memories aren't in that house, Lydie.

22:42.694 --> 22:45.614
They're in your heart,
and no fire can take them from you.

22:45.697 --> 22:48.784
Also, you have, like,
four million boxes in your car already.

22:49.701 --> 22:50.911
I think you're good.

22:52.913 --> 22:53.789
Okay.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.792
Okay, let's go.

22:56.875 --> 22:57.834
Okay.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.169
Let's go. Uh…

22:59.669 --> 23:03.048
Um, do you two
want to follow me back to town?

23:03.131 --> 23:05.133
No, you go ahead.
We still have to check on Bert.

23:05.217 --> 23:08.553
-We'll be right behind you. Drive safe.
-Okay, you too. Take care.

23:09.429 --> 23:12.432
-[gentle music playing]
-[sirens continue in background]

23:13.934 --> 23:15.769
It only happened the one time.

23:17.562 --> 23:20.065
But I've relived that moment
every single day.

23:20.899 --> 23:24.736
It's been almost four months
and I want it to stop.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.071
I need it to stop.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.199
So I can move on with my life.

23:29.282 --> 23:32.619
And you believe bringing the defendant
to justice will allow you to do so?

23:33.995 --> 23:35.330
I really hope so.

23:36.164 --> 23:38.667
[Ms. Richardson] Thank you for sharing
your story with the court.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.128
It was very brave of you, Ms. Sheridan.

23:41.211 --> 23:44.589
That said, I am sorry
you had to relive the details again today.

23:46.466 --> 23:48.176
No further questions, Your Honor.

23:49.928 --> 23:53.432
Yes.
Thank you for being here, Ms. Sheridan.

23:54.015 --> 23:57.018
While the ADA and I may not agree
on the facts of this case,

23:57.102 --> 24:00.939
we do agree that
telling your story was indeed very brave.

24:01.648 --> 24:02.566
Thank you.

24:02.649 --> 24:05.819
If I had been through
what you claim to have been through,

24:05.902 --> 24:08.989
I don't know if I could do it myself.
I'd be a nervous wreck.

24:09.072 --> 24:10.907
But you seemed calm.

24:12.284 --> 24:16.329
Might you have taken anything
to help calm your nerves today?

24:16.413 --> 24:18.373
No, I didn't take anything.

24:19.040 --> 24:22.711
But if you're trying to imply
that I've taken Xanax in the past,

24:22.794 --> 24:23.795
that's no secret.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.089
I had a prescription
to help me with my anxiety.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.633
Well, actually,
I wasn't trying to imply anything,

24:28.717 --> 24:30.469
but as the judge said, you're an attorney.

24:30.552 --> 24:33.597
So if you brought it up, you must feel
it has some bearing on this case.

24:33.680 --> 24:34.723
Objection.

24:34.806 --> 24:38.226
Is the defense testifying Ms. Sheridan's
thoughts or will they allow her to do so?

24:38.310 --> 24:39.144
Sustained.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.854
[lawyer] I'll rephrase the question.

24:40.937 --> 24:44.065
Did you ever drink alcohol
while taking Xanax?

24:44.649 --> 24:45.650
Yes.

24:45.734 --> 24:49.738
What about the night in question?
Did you mix Xanax and alcohol then?

24:49.821 --> 24:50.739
I did.

24:50.822 --> 24:54.034
So isn't it possible you don't remember
what you said that night?

24:54.117 --> 24:54.951
No.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.038
I remember every single detail
of that night.

24:58.121 --> 24:59.915
It's seared into my memory.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.041
[lawyer] Really?

25:01.124 --> 25:04.085
So who was voted off of
Dancing With The Stars?

25:04.169 --> 25:07.172
-Objection. Relevance.
-She said she remembers every detail.

25:07.255 --> 25:09.299
Where is this going, counselor?

25:09.382 --> 25:11.593
Okay. Forget what was on TV.

25:12.719 --> 25:16.431
Do you remember Don asking you
to marry him earlier that evening?

25:17.724 --> 25:20.936
I do, but it was offhanded.
He wasn't serious.

25:21.019 --> 25:23.647
Well, according to my client,
it was very serious.

25:24.564 --> 25:26.483
He wanted to marry you.

25:26.566 --> 25:30.862
That is until he learned of your drug
and alcohol problem and changed his mind.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.657
Leaving you heartbroken
and out for vengeance.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.325
No, that is not what happened.

25:35.408 --> 25:36.451
Objection, Your Honor.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.496
All of our temperatures
are running a little hot right now.

25:39.579 --> 25:43.250
So let's take a 30-minute recess
so we can all cool down.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.417
[gavel bangs]

25:48.505 --> 25:51.716
All right, just stay focused on me, okay?

25:51.800 --> 25:55.387
It's kind of hard not to.
You're all up in my face right now.

25:55.470 --> 25:58.598
Hey, it seems like we're gonna get you
off of here and back to the clinic.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.517
Okay?

26:01.935 --> 26:03.103
-[Kaia] Okay.
-[Doc] Yeah.

26:03.812 --> 26:06.231
Wait! Uh… [laughs] This is gonna hurt?

26:06.314 --> 26:07.274
Yeah, like hell.

26:07.357 --> 26:08.400
-Yeah.
-[Kaia] Yeah.

26:08.483 --> 26:09.401
You ready?

26:09.484 --> 26:10.777
-[Kaia] I got you, buddy.
-Yeah.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.279
[Doc] Everyone lift on three.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.906
One, two, three.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.575
[screaming]

26:16.658 --> 26:18.660
[indistinct chatter]

26:18.743 --> 26:20.745
-[explosion]
-[all exclaiming]

26:21.288 --> 26:23.665
-What the hell is that?
-Unspent ammunition.

26:23.748 --> 26:26.084
We gotta get out of here
before someone gets hurt.

26:26.167 --> 26:27.961
-[explosion]
-Where the hell is Brady?

26:28.044 --> 26:31.047
-[woman hysterically] Hazel! Hazel!
-[Brady] Hey!

26:31.131 --> 26:32.799
-[woman] Hazel!
-Hey!

26:32.882 --> 26:34.801
-Is everything all right?
-My daughter.

26:34.884 --> 26:36.469
-Tell me what happened.
-I can't find her.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.513
The last I saw her,
she was playing right there.

26:38.597 --> 26:42.183
I think she ran off into the woods.
Please. She's only six.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.269
I will find her, I promise. Okay?

26:44.352 --> 26:46.646
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Brady, where you going?

26:46.730 --> 26:48.356
Her daughter's lost out there.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.611
Give me the keys.
All right, here. You take these.

26:52.694 --> 26:55.822
If that fire gets too close, you get
everybody out of here, you hear me?

26:55.905 --> 26:58.074
We're not leaving the forest
till we find your daughter.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.826
-[Jack] What's her name?
-[Brady] Hazel.

26:59.909 --> 27:01.661
-[Jack] Hazel!
-[Brady] Hazel!

27:07.542 --> 27:08.460
[Hope] Hey.

27:09.377 --> 27:10.503
Kaia's fine!

27:10.587 --> 27:13.048
It was someone else
who was injured in the field.

27:13.673 --> 27:16.134
Wait, how did you know her name?

27:16.718 --> 27:19.387
I may be down, but I'm not completely out.

27:19.888 --> 27:22.432
I heard it was just casual,

27:22.515 --> 27:25.518
but it's clear
that you've caught feelings.

27:26.936 --> 27:28.313
Lizzie taught me that phrase.

27:28.396 --> 27:31.274
I have caught feelings, but…

27:32.317 --> 27:33.526
I don't know. I don't…

27:33.610 --> 27:35.612
I don't want to push.
You know, mess things up.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.906
Do you mind if I offer
some unsolicited advice?

27:37.989 --> 27:39.699
[chuckles] If I did, would that stop you?

27:42.077 --> 27:43.870
Tell her how you feel.

27:44.704 --> 27:45.664
Don't hold back.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.832
Who knows? She might feel the same.

27:48.958 --> 27:51.920
Yeah, but what if she doesn't?

27:52.003 --> 27:54.047
Then at least nothing was left unsaid.

27:55.131 --> 27:58.176
She's okay right now,
but she's a hotshot, Preacher.

27:58.802 --> 28:00.428
A real warrior like you.

28:01.179 --> 28:04.182
You know from experience,
anything can happen in the field.

28:05.892 --> 28:07.477
So good. Thank you.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.652
[emotional music playing]

28:33.336 --> 28:35.714
[Mel] All right, Jay,
so I'm gonna start you on some fluids

28:35.797 --> 28:38.007
while Doc is unpacking
and cleaning your wound.

28:40.260 --> 28:42.721
[laughs] Can you see through my leg?

28:42.804 --> 28:45.974
Well, I sure can.
Wow! Look, I can see China down there.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.645
[grunts] What are you gonna do with that?

28:50.729 --> 28:52.105
It's better if I don't tell you.

28:53.106 --> 28:55.066
What? Only you can tell jokes?

28:55.150 --> 28:58.111
It's saline.
We're gonna just flush out the wound

28:58.194 --> 29:00.655
after Mel administers a local anesthetic.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.657
Is this gonna hurt?

29:02.741 --> 29:04.826
It's okay. It shouldn't hurt very much.

29:04.909 --> 29:09.414
Thank you, all of you,
for taking such good care of me today.

29:09.497 --> 29:10.373
It's our pleasure.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.584
Honestly, I was just
a glorified mover today.

29:12.667 --> 29:13.877
Doc deserves the credit.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.045
It was his call in the field,
and it was the right one.

29:16.129 --> 29:19.591
Well, everyone was pulling
more than their weight today,

29:19.674 --> 29:21.676
on and off the field.

29:21.760 --> 29:25.305
Especially you and Kaia.
Thank you. Thank you for your bravery.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.642
[indistinct chatter]

29:32.979 --> 29:35.899
Lydie! It's about damn time.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.650
What took you so long?

29:37.734 --> 29:40.904
I got lost on a trip down memory lane.

29:41.571 --> 29:44.824
[sighs] Luckily, Lizzie and Denny
found me on their way to Bert's.

29:44.908 --> 29:47.827
-[amber alerts chiming]
-[all muttering]

29:47.911 --> 29:48.995
What is it, Hope?

29:50.121 --> 29:52.707
They just issued an evacuation order
for your zone.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.961
Lizzie and Denny are still out there.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.923
[ominous music playing]

30:06.721 --> 30:11.476
Of all the federal courthouses
in all the towns, in all the world.

30:12.519 --> 30:13.561
Hey.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.271
[laughs] Um…

30:15.355 --> 30:17.357
Are you here testifying in a case?

30:17.440 --> 30:19.442
You know it. What brings you here?

30:19.526 --> 30:20.985
Same thing, actually.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.404
But, uh, we're on recess.

30:23.488 --> 30:26.574
I think I may have
upset the judge with my candor.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.452
-[Mike] What's the case?
-Uh…

30:29.536 --> 30:30.370
It's, um…

30:30.453 --> 30:34.290
-None of my business. Sorry.
-No, no, it's fine. Um, I'm just…

30:36.960 --> 30:37.961
Never mind.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.339
It's nice to see your face.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.092
Always nice to see yours.

30:47.512 --> 30:51.850
Well, hey, give 'em hell.
Take no prisoners, because that's my job.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.352
Brie, can I talk to you for a second?

30:54.435 --> 30:55.520
Yeah.

30:55.603 --> 30:56.604
Sheridan.

30:57.188 --> 30:58.189
You got this.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.241
[Brady] Hazel!

31:09.117 --> 31:10.743
-[explosion in distance]
-Hazel!

31:11.494 --> 31:13.496
[Jack] Your mom's
looking for you, sweetheart!

31:13.580 --> 31:17.125
[Brady coughs] We're running out of time.
We're need to split up, cover more ground.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.544
[Jack] No, no, no.
It's too easy to get lost in the smoke.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.129
-Jack, if we don't split up--
-Brady.

31:21.212 --> 31:24.757
I am not leaving these woods
without that little girl or you.

31:25.508 --> 31:28.887
All right? We're doing
a ranging ground sweep. Together.

31:29.554 --> 31:30.763
Yeah.

31:30.847 --> 31:31.723
Yeah, okay.

31:32.932 --> 31:34.934
[pensive music playing]

31:35.018 --> 31:36.019
[Muriel] Oof.

31:37.061 --> 31:38.354
-Hey!
-Hey.

31:38.438 --> 31:41.441
You look a little pale.
When was the last time you ate?

31:41.524 --> 31:44.402
I don't know. I think I had
a cheeseburger and a s'more last night.

31:44.485 --> 31:46.905
-Feels like ages ago, though.
-It was.

31:47.488 --> 31:48.489
You need to eat.

31:49.782 --> 31:51.034
[fridge opens]

31:51.117 --> 31:53.161
-Um, is Ava in the waiting room?
-Nope.

31:53.244 --> 31:57.457
We are actually empty right now,
so we can enjoy a proper lunch.

31:57.540 --> 31:59.042
She didn't call either?

31:59.125 --> 32:01.502
No, but service is spotty.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.963
I'm not even sure
if my cell is working at all.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.090
Well, she was supposed to be here
half an hour ago,

32:06.174 --> 32:08.134
and it's been over an hour, so I'm gonna…

32:08.217 --> 32:09.427
I'm gonna go check on her.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.055
Uh, Doc and Cameron
should be fine while I'm gone.

32:12.138 --> 32:14.307
At least take some turkey slices with you.

32:14.390 --> 32:16.809
You can wrap them around
the cheese sticks.

32:16.893 --> 32:19.771
-Thank you.
-You want me to go with you?

32:19.854 --> 32:21.272
No, no. I'll be fine.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.442
I mean, besides, the boys need
somebody to look after them, right?

32:24.525 --> 32:25.652
It's the truth.

32:25.735 --> 32:28.404
Those two alone,
they'll burn the place down.

32:29.238 --> 32:31.824
Okay. That was…
That was too soon, wasn't it?

32:31.908 --> 32:33.034
-It was--
-Okay.

32:33.117 --> 32:35.453
Pretend I didn't say it
and come back in one piece.

32:35.536 --> 32:36.454
[Mel] Okay.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.208
-[Jack coughing]
-[grave music playing]

32:40.833 --> 32:41.918
Hazel!

32:43.711 --> 32:44.754
Hazel!

32:45.421 --> 32:46.547
[flames rushing]

32:49.175 --> 32:51.302
-It's about to get hot in here.
-[fire whooshing]

32:51.386 --> 32:52.804
[Jack grunts]

32:54.555 --> 32:55.890
[Brady] Jack! Jack.

32:56.891 --> 32:57.892
You all right?

32:58.851 --> 32:59.686
Yeah.

33:01.270 --> 33:02.522
[Brady] Hazel!

33:02.605 --> 33:04.440
-Yeah, I'm good.
-Hazel!

33:06.109 --> 33:07.402
[Preacher] Okay, thanks.

33:09.570 --> 33:11.239
-Still no word?
-[Hope] No.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.492
[Nick] Lydie?

33:15.535 --> 33:18.621
How did you get here so fast?
We just sent out the alert.

33:18.705 --> 33:21.124
I followed the original fire plan…

33:21.207 --> 33:23.251
-Of my own volition.
-[Nick] Hope.

33:23.876 --> 33:26.587
Okay, fine.
I sent Lizzie and Denny out there--

33:26.671 --> 33:28.673
After I told you I'd handle it?

33:28.756 --> 33:31.718
You went behind my back
and put lives in danger?

33:31.801 --> 33:34.595
Well, if it weren't for them,
I'd still be out there.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.347
Yeah, but now they're out there.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.600
And I just got word
that the cell towers are down.

33:39.684 --> 33:42.061
So unless they're listening
to their car radio,

33:42.145 --> 33:44.063
they have no way of knowing
they're in danger.

33:44.147 --> 33:47.400
I don't know if Lizzie and Denny
even know what a car radio is.

33:47.483 --> 33:50.695
-Can't you send somebody for them?
-We can't do that now.

33:50.778 --> 33:53.698
The fire's somewhere between
a rank four and a rank five,

33:53.781 --> 33:57.618
which means it's so bad
that they're evacuating the firefighters.

33:57.702 --> 34:00.872
All we can do now is pray
that they get back safely.

34:02.081 --> 34:03.082
Nick, I'm…

34:03.166 --> 34:05.543
-I'm sorry.
-Hope, this was a big mistake.

34:05.626 --> 34:08.046
A mistake that proves
you're not fit to be mayor.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.551
[grave music playing]

34:16.429 --> 34:17.430
[Denny sputters]

34:18.181 --> 34:21.309
-[Lizzie] Can you believe this?
-I've never seen anything like it.

34:22.810 --> 34:24.145
[sputters]

34:24.729 --> 34:26.647
-Denny, stop!
-[flames whooshing]

34:28.858 --> 34:29.901
[Lizzie] What do we do now?

34:29.984 --> 34:31.611
-[Denny] We turn around.
-What about Bert?

34:31.694 --> 34:34.906
Hopefully he's already left. I don't think
anybody's getting around this.

34:39.452 --> 34:41.454
[grave music continues]

34:45.750 --> 34:49.921
[judge] I will ask you to disregard
the defense's previous attempts

34:50.004 --> 34:54.175
to characterize Ms. Sheridan's motives
for being here today.

34:54.759 --> 34:55.760
You may proceed.

34:56.511 --> 34:57.845
But no more theatrics

34:57.929 --> 34:59.222
from either of you.

35:00.014 --> 35:03.184
Thank you, Your Honor. I'll rephrase.

35:04.727 --> 35:05.812
Ms. Sheridan.

35:06.354 --> 35:09.816
Did your good friend,
who just so happens to be the ADA,

35:10.608 --> 35:13.236
tell you that her case
against my client was weak

35:13.319 --> 35:16.405
and she needed more women
to come forward to help solidify it?

35:16.489 --> 35:19.408
She told me my testimony
could make a difference,

35:19.492 --> 35:23.121
but only after I told her
I was planning to press charges of my own.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.164
To get back at Don.

35:25.248 --> 35:26.874
[Brie] Absolutely not.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.418
I've been dumped
plenty of times in my life.

35:29.502 --> 35:32.463
I've never gotten back at anybody
by accusing them of rape.

35:32.547 --> 35:33.422
So…

35:34.048 --> 35:36.467
why didn't you report it
four months ago, then?

35:36.551 --> 35:39.720
Why wait until your friend
brought a case against him?

35:40.930 --> 35:41.806
Honestly,

35:42.890 --> 35:44.809
because I was scared to do this.

35:45.893 --> 35:48.479
As we've established, I'm a lawyer.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.482
I know how cases like this go.

35:51.566 --> 35:54.986
Lawyers like you try to destroy
women like me on the stand

35:55.069 --> 35:58.030
so the jury won't believe
one single word of my story.

35:58.114 --> 36:01.117
Well, now who's attempting
to characterize whose motives?

36:02.118 --> 36:05.329
I think what you're saying
is you didn't press charges before

36:05.413 --> 36:10.042
because you knew if it was your own case,
your story would never hold up in court.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.295
No further questions.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.840
Prosecution would like to redirect.

36:15.923 --> 36:18.426
I assumed you would. Proceed.

36:20.761 --> 36:22.221
Is that what you were saying?

36:22.805 --> 36:23.973
That you were scared to report

36:24.056 --> 36:26.225
'cause you were afraid
your story won't hold up in court?

36:26.309 --> 36:27.310
[Brie] No.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.938
No, what I was trying to say
is that I didn't report it

36:31.022 --> 36:33.065
because I didn't want to sit here

36:33.149 --> 36:35.484
and be discredited
by some defense attorney

36:35.568 --> 36:37.236
playing the hero to her client.

36:38.738 --> 36:42.074
I know how this goes.
I've played the hero before.

36:43.242 --> 36:44.869
But now… [chuckles]

36:45.453 --> 36:50.291
I know real heroes aren't well-paid,
well-dressed lawyers

36:50.374 --> 36:53.711
making well-rehearsed arguments
from the safety of their courtroom.

36:54.921 --> 36:55.838
Real heroes…

36:57.548 --> 36:59.967
are the ones with the courage
to do what's right.

37:01.052 --> 37:05.348
Who walk toward the things
most people would run away from.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.059
-[Hazel screams]
-[Jack] There she is.

37:09.310 --> 37:10.311
[Brady] Hazel.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.648
-Come on out.
-[Jack] Put this around your mouth.

37:13.731 --> 37:14.815
[Brady] There you go.

37:14.899 --> 37:17.443
Your mom's looking for you.
We're gonna go get her, okay?

37:17.526 --> 37:19.695
-[Hazel coughing]
-[Brady] You're all right!

37:20.947 --> 37:23.532
[Brie] They're the people
who push past their fears.

37:23.616 --> 37:25.993
[uplifting music playing]

37:28.162 --> 37:29.705
[Brie] Who face the unknown.

37:31.958 --> 37:34.168
[uplifting music continues]

37:44.345 --> 37:46.347
[EKG beeping regularly]

37:47.556 --> 37:49.100
[EKG beeping rapidly]

37:49.183 --> 37:51.727
-[Cameron] His heart rate's spiking.
-[Doc] We need to push fluids.

37:51.811 --> 37:52.687
[Cameron] On it.

37:53.229 --> 37:54.355
[EKG beeping rapidly]

37:54.438 --> 37:56.148
[uplifting music continues]

37:57.233 --> 37:59.068
[Brie] And hold on to their faith…

38:03.990 --> 38:06.117
even when the deck
is stacked against them.

38:14.709 --> 38:15.835
And I hope…

38:16.460 --> 38:18.421
if you ever end up in my position,

38:18.504 --> 38:20.923
that you'll be able
to hold on to your faith too.

38:21.007 --> 38:22.258
Because, statistically,

38:22.341 --> 38:25.678
in a country where one in six women
are sexually assaulted,

38:25.761 --> 38:27.388
and where more women

38:27.888 --> 38:30.891
are killed by their domestic partners
in this century

38:30.975 --> 38:33.060
than men who have died in war…

38:34.937 --> 38:36.647
someday you just might.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.152
[moving music playing]

38:44.613 --> 38:46.365
No further questions, Your Honor.

38:51.454 --> 38:52.955
[attendants murmuring]

38:59.253 --> 39:00.713
[Brie exhales]

39:01.630 --> 39:03.007
[laughs]

39:03.090 --> 39:05.009
Don't you have somewhere better to be?

39:05.551 --> 39:08.512
Thought I'd stick around.
Make sure you were okay.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.557
[chuckles] I am not okay.

39:13.142 --> 39:15.353
Not yet anyway, but…

39:16.604 --> 39:20.274
for the first time in a long time,
I think I might be soon.

39:20.983 --> 39:22.193
[laughs]

39:22.276 --> 39:26.364
Well, if you ever want to talk about it…
I'm happy to listen.

39:26.864 --> 39:27.990
I would like that.

39:28.074 --> 39:29.825
-[phone ringing]
-Oh.

39:30.326 --> 39:31.660
Yeah, it's my mom. Just…

39:31.744 --> 39:32.870
Sorry, one sec.

39:32.953 --> 39:34.288
Hey, Mom.

39:37.291 --> 39:38.751
What? What's going on?

39:38.834 --> 39:40.920
[tense music playing]

39:41.003 --> 39:42.963
All right, all right. Okay, slow down.

39:43.672 --> 39:45.758
Okay, I will be there as soon as I can.

39:47.551 --> 39:49.553
There's a wildfire in Virgin River.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.724
-[Jack] We got her.
-[Brady] You're okay. She's all right.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.559
A tree top exploded and it scared her.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.603
-She was hiding.
-[Hazel] It was so loud, Mommy!

39:57.686 --> 40:00.022
-[woman] I know, sweetie, you're safe now.
-[Brady] Come on.

40:00.106 --> 40:01.690
[Hazel coughing]

40:01.774 --> 40:03.567
[Brady] Okay. I got her.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.486
One, two, three, up. There you go.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.906
All right.
I'm gonna follow you back to town.

40:08.989 --> 40:10.491
Thanks for having my back today.

40:10.574 --> 40:12.326
Well, thanks for having mine in Iraq.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.122
[amber alert chiming]

40:22.670 --> 40:25.506
Hey, Brady! Brady! Listen, I gotta go!
Mel might be in trouble!

40:25.589 --> 40:27.675
-Go, go, go! I'll meet you at the bar.
-Okay.

40:27.758 --> 40:29.885
-[EKG beeping rapidly]
-[tense music continues]

40:29.969 --> 40:32.346
[Doc] What are we missing here?
What are we missing?

40:32.430 --> 40:34.056
-[Cameron] He's coding.
-[EKG flatlining]

40:34.849 --> 40:36.392
[Doc] I'll start chest compressions.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.895
[tense music continues]

40:39.979 --> 40:41.981
[EKG flatlining]

40:53.284 --> 40:54.285
[gasping]

40:55.286 --> 40:57.746
-Oh God, what are we gonna do?
-I have no idea.

41:05.504 --> 41:06.380
Oh my God.

41:11.135 --> 41:13.137
[dramatic music playing]

41:20.853 --> 41:21.770
Ava!

41:23.522 --> 41:24.398
Ava!

41:24.482 --> 41:26.150
[baby crying]

41:26.233 --> 41:27.234
Chloe.

41:28.611 --> 41:29.737
Oh my God.

41:31.989 --> 41:33.991
[crying continues]

41:36.535 --> 41:38.537
[dramatic music building]

41:38.621 --> 41:40.206
[crying fades]
