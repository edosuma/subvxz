MINDY.

00:11.446 --> 00:12.621
YEAH, NO,
I MADE IT UP.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.492

00:24.850 --> 00:26.156

A REALLY INTERESTING STORY.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.418
I'M--I'M KIDDING.
HE'S A BROWN BEAR.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.420

00:29.464 --> 00:30.726

00:30.769 --> 00:33.381
BRENDAN, I NEED

00:44.131 --> 00:45.306
UH--UH--DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT IT ON?

OH, COOL.TOMORROW NIGHT.

01:04.107 --> 01:05.543
MAYBE WE
COULD GO TOGETHER.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.284
I DON'T THINK SO.

01:07.328 --> 01:08.894
YOU DON'T WANNA COME?

01:08.938 --> 01:11.897

01:13.508 --> 01:15.510
ON THE WHOLE DATING THING
AS A CONCEPT,

01:15.553 --> 01:16.815
AND I WAS JUST THINKING
MAYBE WE COULD

01:16.859 --> 01:18.165
JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE,
YOU KNOW?

01:18.208 --> 01:19.166
IS THAT OKAY?

KEEP IT SIMPLE.

01:23.561 --> 01:25.476
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

OH, MY GOD.
MINDY, WE HAVE TO--

01:31.830 --> 01:32.962
WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT THE KNIFE.

01:33.005 --> 01:34.311
YOU CANNOT HAVE
A KNIFE UNDER YOUR PILLOW.

01:34.355 --> 01:36.313
BRENDAN, IT'S IN CASE
THERE'S A SERIAL MURDERER.

01:36.357 --> 01:39.011
YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS IT IS
TO HAVE THIS THERE.

01:39.055 --> 01:40.535
BRENDAN, DO YOU KNOW
HOW DANGEROUS IT WOULD BE

01:40.578 --> 01:41.666
IF I DIDN'T HAVE IT?

01:41.710 --> 01:42.711
IF YOU WERE
A SERIAL MURDERER

01:42.754 --> 01:43.973

02:21.619 --> 02:22.751
WHAT MY OPTIONS ARE,

04:01.371 --> 04:03.373

06:30.520 --> 06:31.782
OH, WE DON'T LIKE
TO USE THE TERM "DEAD."

06:31.826 --> 06:33.305
WE TRY TO GO
WITH "POINTLESS"

06:33.349 --> 06:35.656
OR "WASTE OF TIME,"
"USELESS."

06:35.699 --> 06:37.092
MAY I MAKE
A MARKETING SUGGESTION?

06:37.135 --> 06:38.093
I WOULD LOVE IT.
WE NEED IT.

06:38.136 --> 06:39.442
YOU NEED TO GET THEM

06:39.486 --> 06:40.835
TO MAKE
ANOTHER INDIANA JONESMOVIE.

06:40.878 --> 06:43.664
THOSE MOVIES
MAKE LATIN LOOK SO COOL.

06:43.707 --> 06:46.449
HE'S IN A CAVE, HE'S READING
A LATIN INSCRIPTION BY TORCH.YEAH.

06:46.493 --> 06:47.581
YOU KNOW,
THE LATIN DEPARTMENT

06:47.624 --> 06:49.365
DOESN'T HAVE
AS MUCH SWAY IN HOLLYWOOD.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.106
I THINK YOU'RE MAYBE THINKING
OF THE HEBREW DEPARTMENT.

06:51.149 --> 06:52.716
[chuckles]AND THAT'S OFFENSIVE,
BY THE WAY.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.632
THAT IS VERY EDGY.YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.

06:55.676 --> 06:59.549
UM, HEY, I'D LOVE TO,
UH, GET YOUR NUMBER,

06:59.593 --> 07:01.464
AND MAYBE WE COULD
HANG OUT SOME TIME.

07:01.508 --> 07:05.512
OH, UM,
THAT'S REALLY NICE.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.992
THE THING IS,
I WORK A LOT, AND I'M SINGLE,

07:08.036 --> 07:09.907
SO I SHOULD REALLY BE
SPENDING MOST OF MY TIME

07:09.951 --> 07:13.911
TRYING TO, LIKE, MEET A GUY
AND NOT MAKING NEW FRIENDS.

07:13.955 --> 07:17.088
YOU DON'T FEEL A-A SPARK
HERE AT ALL?

07:17.132 --> 07:18.481
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:18.525 --> 07:20.570
ALL RIGHT, DON'T MAKE THIS
THAT EMBARRASSING FOR ME.

07:20.614 --> 07:22.616
I WAS TRYING
TO ASK YOU OUT ON A DATE.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.748
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

07:24.792 --> 07:26.794
HUH?
OH, LUCY?

07:26.837 --> 07:28.796
OH, NO,
LUCY IS NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

07:28.839 --> 07:29.840
LUCY IS MY BEST FRIEND.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.625
[Lucy]
MM-HMM.

07:31.668 --> 07:33.496
OH.

07:33.540 --> 07:35.542
I-I GUESS
I WAS CONFUSED.

07:35.585 --> 07:37.108
GUESS WHO'S GOING OUT
WITH ME.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.154
REALLY?
I LOVE THAT.

07:39.197 --> 07:40.155
I LOVE THAT.

07:40.198 --> 07:41.286
COOL.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.507
[Mindy]
HEY, SO THAT GUY JAMIE
FROM LAST NIGHT

07:44.551 --> 07:45.943
ASKED ME OUT.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.162
JAMIE
FROM LUCY AND JAMIE?

07:47.205 --> 07:49.338
YEAH, GET THIS.
THEY ARE NOT A COUPLE.

07:49.381 --> 07:50.818
MINDY, THEY'RE SO OBVIOUSLY
A COUPLE.

07:50.861 --> 07:51.775
THEY'RE DEFINITELY
A COUPLE.COME ON, THEY'RE ADORABLE.

07:51.819 --> 07:52.907
NO, THEY'RE
JUST BEST FRIENDS.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.517
HE TOLD ME
IN FRONT OF HER.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.301
HUH, I REALLY LIKED THEM
TOGETHER.

07:56.345 --> 07:58.434
WELL, YOU CAN BE FRIENDS
WITH THEM INDIVIDUALLY.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.523
MAYBE IT'S
ONE OF THOSE THINGS

08:00.567 --> 08:01.829
WHERE EVERYONE
SEES IT EXCEPT THEM

08:01.872 --> 08:04.222
LIKE WHEN HARRY MET SALLY.YES.

08:04.266 --> 08:05.397
YOU HATE THAT MOVIE.

08:05.441 --> 08:06.703
YOU CALL IT
WHEN DOOFUS MET DUMMY.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.400
IT WAS VERY DISRESPECTFUL.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.794
NO, HE'S BILLY CRYSTAL,
AND SHE'S MEG RYAN.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.274
WELL, THEN, WHO AM I?

08:12.317 --> 08:13.623
BRUNO KIRBY.YEP.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.277
I'M NOT EVEN CARRIE FISHER?

08:15.320 --> 08:18.323
NOPE.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.282
YOU'RE THE LADY THAT SAYS,
"I'LL HAVE WHAT SHE'S HAVING."

08:20.325 --> 08:21.849
I'M ROB REINER'S MOTHER?

08:21.892 --> 08:25.026
YEAH, I LIKE THIS PLACE.
IT'S KINDA FUNKY.

08:25.069 --> 08:27.071
DANNY, I WANTED TO, UH...

08:27.115 --> 08:28.595
YOU KNOW,
I THINK THAT--

08:28.638 --> 08:30.510
WHOO!
THAT MEXICAN HOT CHOCOLATE'S

08:30.553 --> 08:32.076
GOT A REAL KICK TO IT,
HUH?

08:32.120 --> 08:33.904
YEAH, YOU SHOULD HAVE
JUST ORDERED A COFFEE.

08:33.948 --> 08:36.559
THEY SHOULD LABEL THAT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

08:36.603 --> 08:39.780
I MEAN, IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT
THAT SPICY, IT SHOULD BE--

08:39.823 --> 08:41.738
DANNY, I ASKED YOU
TO MEET UP BECAUSE--

08:41.782 --> 08:44.611
OOH, I GOT A BRAIN FREEZE
RIGHT NOW.

08:44.654 --> 08:45.829
OH, OKAY. YEP.YEP.

08:45.873 --> 08:46.961
SPIT THAT OUT.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.440
UM...
WOW.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.355
YEAH,
WE'RE BOTH SO BUSY

08:50.399 --> 08:51.879
THAT I THINK WE FORGOT
TO REALIZE

08:51.922 --> 08:53.533
THAT WE'RE NOT
ENJOYING THIS ANYMORE.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.447
WAIT A MINUTE.
YEAH.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.406
ARE YOU BREAKING UP
WITH ME?

08:57.449 --> 08:58.494
YES.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.584
OKAY.

09:01.628 --> 09:02.629
OH, YOU--

09:02.672 --> 09:03.934
NO, I JUST DIDN'T
SEE THAT COMING.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.501
I MEAN, THAT'S--
OKAY.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.417
REALLY?

09:08.460 --> 09:10.332
WOW, YOU GOTTA
LABEL THIS!

09:10.375 --> 09:12.377
YOU GOTTA--

09:12.421 --> 09:14.554
I MEAN, COME ON, PEOPLE.
YOU GOTTA LABEL IT.

09:14.597 --> 09:15.859
AT A CHINESE PLACE...

09:15.903 --> 09:17.426
[voice cracks]
THEY PUT A PEPPER

09:17.469 --> 09:19.471
NEXT TO THE ITEM ON THE MENU,
AND THEN YOU KNOW IT--

09:19.515 --> 09:21.996
[coughs]
IT'S SPICY.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.475
[Mindy]
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED, DANNY?

09:23.519 --> 09:26.522
SHE JUST SAID
IT WASN'T WORKING,

09:26.566 --> 09:28.089
AND I JUST
GOT OUT OF THERE.

09:28.132 --> 09:29.481
WHAT?
YOU JUST LEFT?

09:29.525 --> 09:30.570
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

09:30.613 --> 09:31.571
YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE A SCENE?

09:31.614 --> 09:33.094
YEAH,
MAKE A BIG SCENE...

09:33.137 --> 09:34.356
YES. IF YOU WANNA
KEEP YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.271
THIS IS HOW THEY DO THIS
IN THE MOVIES, OKAY?

09:36.314 --> 09:37.533
BIG OVERTURES.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.884
LIKE IN,
UM, PRETTY WOMAN,

09:40.928 --> 09:42.625
OR, UM, SAY ANYTHING.OH, YEAH.

09:42.669 --> 09:46.629
SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.632
REMEMBER IN GOODFELLAS

09:49.676 --> 09:51.503
WHEN RAY LIOTTA
GIVES HIS WIFE THAT BLOODY GUN?

09:51.547 --> 09:52.896
THAT WAS SWEET.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.158
THAT WAS VERY ROMANTIC,

09:54.202 --> 09:55.507
AND THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO THEN.

09:55.551 --> 09:56.900
YEAH, SHE'S RIGHT.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.119
ONE TIME,
TO GET A GIRL BACK,

09:58.162 --> 10:00.164
I DROVE A MOTORCYCLE
THROUGH A FLAMING HOOP.

10:00.208 --> 10:01.165
SEE?

10:01.209 --> 10:02.427
A FLAMING HOOP? YEAH.

10:02.471 --> 10:03.646
WHO WOULDN'T MARRY
A GUY

10:03.690 --> 10:05.474
WHO OWNS
HIS OWN FLAMING HOOP?

10:05.517 --> 10:07.476
NO, I BORROWED THE HOOP
FROM MY FRIEND.

10:07.519 --> 10:08.651
SO YOU GUYS
ARE TELLING ME

10:08.695 --> 10:10.958
THAT I SHOULD DO,
LIKE, A BIG--
YES.

10:13.874 --> 10:15.919
[Jamie]
THINK HOW WEIRD IT IS
TO BE PRINCE HARRY.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.269
OKAY, YOU'RE RICH, YOU'RE
FAMOUS, YOU LIKE TO PARTY,

10:18.313 --> 10:19.314
AND THEN EVERY NOW AND THEN,
YOU GO TOO FAR

10:19.357 --> 10:20.663
AND YOUR PARENTS ARE LIKE,

10:20.707 --> 10:22.839
"YOU MUSTN'T EMBARRASS
THE THRONE OF ENGLAND."

10:22.883 --> 10:24.536
AND YOU'RE LIKE,
"WHAT? IS THIS MY LIFE?

10:24.580 --> 10:26.060
IS THIS A THING?"

10:26.103 --> 10:28.105
WOULDN'T PRINCE HARRY'S
INSTAGRAM BE SO GOOD?

10:28.149 --> 10:29.280
IT WOULD BE AMAZING.

10:29.324 --> 10:30.891
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?YEAH.

10:30.934 --> 10:31.979
ARE GUYS JUST, LIKE,

10:32.022 --> 10:34.416
OBSESSED WITH THEIR
ABDOMINAL MUSCLES?

10:34.459 --> 10:36.461
IT'S LIKE THE HEADLINE
OF EVERY MAN'S MAGAZINE

10:36.505 --> 10:39.334
IS HOW TO MAKE YOUR ABS GREAT,
BUT GIRLS DON'T CARE.

10:39.377 --> 10:40.944
MEN'S HEALTH
IS JUST ABOUT ABS, RIGHT.

10:40.988 --> 10:43.381
NOTHING IS ABOUT, LIKE...NO GIRLS
HAVE EVER BEEN, LIKE...

10:43.425 --> 10:45.470
"FACE TODAY.""I WISH YOU HAD
A FLATTER STOMACH" RIGHT?

10:45.514 --> 10:46.689
WELL,
I SHOULD HOPE NOT.

10:46.733 --> 10:47.995
THEY'RE LIKE,
"I WISH YOU MADE MORE MONEY."

10:48.038 --> 10:50.171
"I WISH YOU WOULD OPEN UP
ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS."

10:50.214 --> 10:51.607
YOU SHOULD BE EDITOR
OF A MEN'S MAGAZINE.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.827
BIG, FAT SLOBS I'D CALL IT.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.393
WHO ARE PAID WELL.

10:55.437 --> 10:58.440
[phone chimes]

11:05.012 --> 11:06.274
SORRY, JUST A WORK THING.

11:06.317 --> 11:08.189
YEAH, SURE.

11:08.232 --> 11:09.233
SO, UM,
I HAVE TO ASK YOU THIS.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.974
WHAT IS THE DEAL
WITH YOU AND LUCY?

11:11.018 --> 11:12.454
I MEAN,
YOU'RE SO CLOSE.

11:12.497 --> 11:13.455
WHY DON'T YOU JUST--

11:13.498 --> 11:14.456
DATE?
YEAH.

11:14.499 --> 11:15.762
I GET ASKED THAT A LOT.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.807
LUCY AND I HAVE KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOR 15 YEARS.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.287
IF SOMETHING
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN,

11:19.330 --> 11:20.288
IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
BY NOW.

11:20.331 --> 11:21.898
I DON'T WANNA BE
THAT, LIKE, RANDO

11:21.942 --> 11:23.508
THAT GERARD BUTLER
WASTES HIS TIME WITH

11:23.552 --> 11:24.988
BEFORE HE REALIZES
THAT HE'S REALLY IN LOVE

11:25.032 --> 11:26.076
WITH KATE BECKINSALE.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.208
WAIT, WHAT MOVIE IS THAT?

11:27.251 --> 11:28.426
OH, IT'S NOT A MOVIE.

11:28.470 --> 11:29.950
I JUST THINK THEY WOULD HAVE
GREAT CHEMISTRY.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.908
YEAH, THEY WOULD BECAUSE THEY
CAN BOTH DO ACTION TOO.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.431
YEAH, DUH,
THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT

11:33.475 --> 11:34.911
IT WAS A GREAT IDEA
FOR A MOVIE.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.565
WELL, I THINK YOU AND I HAVE
THE SAME TASTE IN MOVIES.

11:36.608 --> 11:39.002
WE HAVE A BOTTLE
OF WINE FOR YOU.

11:39.046 --> 11:40.134
IT'S A GIFT.

11:40.177 --> 11:41.265
WHOA, THANKS.

11:41.309 --> 11:42.571
WHO SENT THIS?

11:42.614 --> 11:44.181
"HEY, YOU TWO.

11:44.225 --> 11:45.182
"HAVE THE BESTEST TIME.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.054
LOVE...LUCY."

11:47.097 --> 11:48.577
NO.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.971
HOW COOL IS LUCY?

11:51.014 --> 11:52.233
KIND OF STALKERISH.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.234
DO YOU MIND IF I CALL HER
AND TELL HER--

11:53.277 --> 11:54.496
N--UH, SURE.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.541
HEY, IT'S ME.

11:56.585 --> 11:57.673
YEAH.
WE WERE JUST AT THE MOMENT

11:57.717 --> 11:59.240
WHERE IT'S LIKE,
"DO WE ORDER MORE WINE?"

11:59.283 --> 12:00.676
TELL HER I--"I DON'T WANNA PUSH IT ON--"

12:00.720 --> 12:01.895
TELL HER I SAID THANK--ONE SECOND.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.548
WAIT, WHAT?

12:03.592 --> 12:04.854
NO, WE'RE NOT
ORDERING DESSERT YET.

12:04.898 --> 12:07.117
NO, IT'S GONNA BE ONE
OF THOSE THINGS, I KNOW.

12:07.161 --> 12:08.597
I KNOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN,
IT'S GONNA COME,

12:08.640 --> 12:10.207
AND I'LL BE LIKE,
"SHOULD WE?"

12:10.251 --> 12:11.905
AND SHE'LL SAY,
"JUST THE CHECK."

12:11.948 --> 12:12.906
AND THEN I'LL LOOK LIKE
I WAS MORE INTO IT.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.559
ANYWAY...

12:14.603 --> 12:15.822
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO THERE?

12:15.865 --> 12:18.999
HEY, I'M JUST GONNA
GO USE THE BATHROOM, OKAY?

12:19.042 --> 12:21.479
HEY, IF YOU WANNA
SEND OVER DESSERT.

12:21.523 --> 12:22.785
I'M JUST KIDDING,
BUT, UM,

12:22.829 --> 12:24.874
THAT WAS REALLY,
REALLY CLASSY OF YOU, LUCY.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.571
REALLY COOL.

12:26.615 --> 12:29.574
[doorbell buzzes]

12:29.618 --> 12:30.445
WELL, WELL, WELL.

12:30.488 --> 12:33.448
ALL RIGHT.

12:33.491 --> 12:34.623
ALL RIGHT YOURSELF.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.538
KOMBUCHA?

12:38.714 --> 12:40.107
[Mindy]
THE DATE WITH JAMIE

12:40.150 --> 12:41.630
WAS GOING REALLY WELL...
UNTIL HE GOT ON THE PHONE

12:41.673 --> 12:43.501
WITH LUCY THE WHOLE TIME.
IT WAS SUPER WEIRD.

12:43.545 --> 12:44.981
WHY DON'T YOU RIP
THAT PHONE OUT OF HIS HANDS

12:45.025 --> 12:46.591
AND THROW IT
ACROSS THE ROOM?

12:46.635 --> 12:48.245
I WAS NOT
THINKING RATIONALLY.

12:48.289 --> 12:49.464
ALL RIGHT.

12:49.507 --> 12:52.772
ALSO, WHAT GUY
HAS A FEMALE BEST FRIEND?

12:52.815 --> 12:54.382
OH, HE'S GAY.
NEXT.

12:54.425 --> 12:55.731
NO, HE'S NOT GAY.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.820
AND WHO WOULD BE SECRETLY GAY
IN THIS DAY AND AGE?

12:57.864 --> 12:59.822
IT'S LIKE THE GOLDEN ERA
FOR COMING OUT OF THE CLOSET.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.998
IT'S ACTUALLY COOLER
TO BE GAY.

13:02.042 --> 13:04.435
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA SEE
HOW THINGS GO WITH BRENDAN.

13:04.479 --> 13:05.959
I SPENT TWO NIGHTS
WITH HIM THIS WEEK.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.525
THAT'S AWESOME.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.614
PLUS, UM, HE KEEPS DIET COKES
IN HIS FRIDGE JUST FOR ME.

13:09.658 --> 13:10.790
SERIOUSLY?

13:10.833 --> 13:12.226
AND HE HAS A MORAL ISSUE
WITH ASPARTAME.

13:12.269 --> 13:13.401
[Maggie]
SUPER NICE.

13:13.444 --> 13:14.794
[Mindy]
YEAH.[Maggie]
HI.

13:14.837 --> 13:15.969
MINDY? [Mindy]
YEAH?

13:16.012 --> 13:16.970
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.188
BATHROOM?

13:18.232 --> 13:20.016
LET'S TURN
THIS WHOLE OPERATION AROUND.

13:20.060 --> 13:23.150
[seal barks]

13:23.193 --> 13:25.630
[Danny]
THERE SHE IS.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.067
HEY, JILLIAN.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.243
OH, MY GOD.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.863
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST

HOW OLD HE IS?WHAT?

14:33.742 --> 14:35.004

14:35.048 --> 14:38.225
IS THIS BECAUSE HE'S NOT
INTERESTING SEXUALLY?

14:38.268 --> 14:41.445
STOP. I AM INTERESTING
SEXUALLY, RIGHT?

14:41.489 --> 14:43.447

14:43.491 --> 14:45.928
OH, YEAH.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.887
YOU SHOW NO INTEREST
IN MY LIFE,

14:47.930 --> 14:50.585
AND THERE'S ONLY ONE RIGHT WAY
TO DO THINGS, APPARENTLY,

14:50.628 --> 14:52.587
AND IT'S
THE DANNY CASTELLANO WAY.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.154

15:47.685 --> 15:49.252
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WAR CRIMINALS

15:49.296 --> 15:50.950
SOMETIMES COME
TO THIS COUNTRY,

15:50.993 --> 15:52.952
AND THEN ONCE THEY'RE HERE,
THEY PRETEND TO BE REFUGEES.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.779

SHE'S A LEGITIMATE REFUGEE.

15:54.823 --> 15:55.955
SHE WAS ON CHARLIE ROSE.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.608
KERMIT THE FROG

BRENDAN, I DON'T

17:16.600 --> 17:17.993
I WAS AT YOUR PLACE

17:21.127 --> 17:22.432
I FIND YOU
IN THE MOVIE THEATER

17:22.476 --> 17:23.955
MAKING OUT
WITH SOME RANDOM GIRL,

17:23.999 --> 17:25.435
WHEN, BY THE WAY,

HOW CAN YOU BE INTIMATE

17:37.491 --> 17:38.492
WITH SO MANY
DIFFERENT PEOPLE?

17:38.535 --> 17:40.407
YOU'RE CONFUSING
INTIMACY WITH SEX.

17:40.450 --> 17:43.062
WHAT IS MORE INTIMATE
THAN HAVING SEX WITH SOMEBODY?

17:43.105 --> 17:46.543

17:46.587 --> 17:48.023
OH, THAT'S GROSS,

EVERY DAY THIS THEATER
LOSES 10% OF OUR 3-D GLASSES,

17:50.417 --> 17:52.593
WHICH MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE
FOR THE OTHER GUESTS

17:52.636 --> 17:54.551
TO ENJOY THE SAME QUALITY
OF 3-D EXPERIENCE AS YOU.

17:54.595 --> 17:55.987
HEY, KID,

18:05.562 --> 18:07.042

THIS IS NOT YOUR CONCERN.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.174
MAYBE THIS
IS OUR FIRST DATE.

18:08.217 --> 18:09.349
MAYBE I'LL NEVER
SEE HER AGAIN.

18:09.392 --> 18:10.350
MAYBE WE'LL GET MARRIED.

18:10.393 --> 18:11.351
MAYBE I'LL SLEEP
WITH YOUR BROTHER.

18:11.394 --> 18:12.395
WHAT?
NO. I'M SORRY.

18:12.439 --> 18:13.701
THAT WAS AWFUL.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.398

SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD DO.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.400

I WAS TRYING TO SAY.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.275
LISTEN TO ME, MINDY.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.842
I AM SORRY IF I HAVE DONE
SOMETHING TO UPSET YOU, OKAY?

18:24.886 --> 18:27.454
AND I AM SORRY

18:30.065 --> 18:32.154
BUT I AM NOT.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.946
DON'T WORRY ABOUT GETTING TEARS
IN THE GLASSES.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.471
WE SANITIZE THEM WEEKLY.

18:44.514 --> 18:47.430

18:48.605 --> 18:49.737
THE WORST PART IS, MAGGIE,

I DON'T THINK
I'LL EVER BE ABLE

18:50.912 --> 18:52.435

18:52.479 --> 18:55.046

I JUST--I LIKED HIM.
I REALLY LIKED HIM.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.846
OH, WAS IT BECAUSE HE WORKED
UPSTAIRS FROM YOU,

19:11.889 --> 19:14.109
OR WAS IT BECAUSE HE HAD
A BAD PERSONALITY?

19:14.153 --> 19:16.546
YOU'RE JUST
FILLING DEAD SPACE.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.244

20:03.419 --> 20:05.465
IT SAYS THAT OFFICE HOURS
