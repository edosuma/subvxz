00:04.571 --> 00:07.839
[grunts]
What's going on?

00:07.874 --> 00:11.476
Don't worry, Miles.
Everything's going to be okay.

00:11.511 --> 00:14.246
Oh, Spidey!
Oh, no! You're stuck too?

00:14.281 --> 00:16.815
Wait. I remember now.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.584
Everyone in the city got
spider powers, and then...

00:19.619 --> 00:22.220
Oh, Spidey! I've run some
hypothetical sequences,

00:22.255 --> 00:23.789
and I think there's a good chance

00:23.790 --> 00:26.258
the people with powers
could turn into Spider-Monsters!

00:26.293 --> 00:29.061
[chittering]
[Spider-Man] Yeah, that's kind of old news.

00:29.096 --> 00:32.229
Let me save you the trouble. Not
only have the people become monsters,

00:32.265 --> 00:35.567
- but they're being controlled by the Jackal.
- That I do know.

00:35.602 --> 00:39.004
Since he was the one who caught me
off guard. My head is still aching.

00:39.039 --> 00:43.508
Well, it's time we caught
him off guard. [grunts]

00:43.543 --> 00:45.510
If we can activate the web
dissolvent in our shooters,

00:45.545 --> 00:47.612
we should be able to...
[web shooter deploys]

00:47.647 --> 00:50.115
[grunts] crawl up to
the air ducts undetected.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.717
[grunts]
Right. Good thinking.

00:52.752 --> 00:56.254
I just gotta be careful not to dissolve
too much... [web shooters deploying]

00:56.289 --> 00:58.590
[screams, grunts]
webbing.

00:58.625 --> 01:00.926
[screeching, growling]
Uh-oh.

01:00.961 --> 01:02.928
Out of the frying pan...

01:02.963 --> 01:06.065
and into a den
of hungry Spider-Monsters!

01:08.408 --> 01:11.495

01:17.277 --> 01:18.811
[growling, screeching]

01:18.812 --> 01:21.213
I go unconscious just for a little bit,

01:21.248 --> 01:23.548
and the entire city
turns into Spider-Monsters?

01:23.583 --> 01:26.585
- They're hideous!
- Don't judge. Maybe in Spider-Monster World,

01:26.620 --> 01:29.554
they're considered very
attractive. [grunts]

01:29.589 --> 01:32.557
There's too many of them!
We gotta get outta here!

01:32.592 --> 01:37.062
[grunts] Problem is, here
is the same as out there.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.397
Jackal's army has taken over
the entire city. [growling]

01:39.432 --> 01:42.234
[laughing]
[gasps]

01:42.269 --> 01:44.636
That's right, Spider-Man.

01:44.671 --> 01:47.072
[chittering]
The entire city is mine!

01:47.107 --> 01:49.574
Stop your gloating.
[both grunt]

01:49.609 --> 01:54.479
To think Raymond Warren couldn't
even get a job in this town.

01:54.514 --> 01:56.581
And now I'm its ruler!

01:56.616 --> 01:58.783
[both grunting]

01:58.818 --> 02:01.620
Is that why you transformed
everyone into monsters?

02:01.655 --> 02:04.356
'Cause you knew normal people would
be out of their minds to follow you?

02:04.391 --> 02:07.859
Oh, I didn't create them
for their minds.

02:07.894 --> 02:10.628
I created them for their strength.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.364
Destroy them!

02:13.733 --> 02:15.134
[grunts]

02:15.135 --> 02:17.369
Aah!
[groans]

02:17.404 --> 02:19.337
[growling, screeching]

02:19.372 --> 02:22.307
Come on! That decoy will only
distract them for a moment.

02:22.342 --> 02:24.543
Harry?
What are you doing here?

02:24.578 --> 02:27.698
Saving you. With some of
Horizon's hologram tech.

02:28.682 --> 02:31.783
- Come on. Let's go.
- You came back for us.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.719
- Does that mean we're cool, then?
- Don't jump to conclusions, Pete.

02:34.754 --> 02:36.955
"Pete"?
He knows who you are?

02:36.990 --> 02:39.158
Boy, a lot can happen when
you're stuck in a cocoon.

02:41.194 --> 02:46.164
[Jackal] It's not real, you fools!
Secure the prisoners!

02:46.199 --> 02:48.200
Time to go!

02:48.235 --> 02:50.302
[screeching, growling]

02:50.337 --> 02:53.805
[growls]
Devour the intruders!

02:53.840 --> 02:55.707
[grunts]

02:55.742 --> 02:57.809
[Spider-Man] That's an exit
line if I ever heard one.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.811
And I've heard a lot of 'em.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.080
[growling]
Easy, my pets.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.983
[chittering] The tracer
I placed on that glider

03:05.018 --> 03:08.120
should lead us right to them.

03:10.290 --> 03:12.824
- Where we headed?
- Horizon has an underground lab

03:12.859 --> 03:14.859
that hasn't been discovered
by the monsters.

03:14.894 --> 03:17.829
Anya's there tending to my dad.
Your blood cured him,

03:17.864 --> 03:19.831
but he's been unconscious
ever since.

03:19.866 --> 03:21.466
I'm sorry, Harry.

03:21.468 --> 03:24.369
Let's just stay focused
on saving the city.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.172
[beeps]

03:29.643 --> 03:32.611
- How is he?
- Still unresponsive.

03:32.646 --> 03:35.080
The cure seems to have worked,
but the shock of receiving

03:35.115 --> 03:38.049
Spider-Man's radioactive blood
was too much for his system.

03:38.084 --> 03:40.643
Will that happen to everyone
who gets the cure?

03:40.690 --> 03:43.655
Not necessarily.
If I can synthesize your blood

03:43.656 --> 03:45.423
and remove the dangerous blood cells,

03:45.458 --> 03:48.126
- it could eliminate the side effects.
- How do we start?

03:48.161 --> 03:51.429
Well, more of your blood
wouldn't hurt.

03:51.464 --> 03:53.765
If we're gonna make
enough cure for the entire city,

03:53.800 --> 03:55.467
I'll take as much
as you can safely give.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.135
Sure thing.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.738
Don't forget what happens
when a person gives blood.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.707
Good point. It'll leave me
in a weakened state.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.776
But I think
we're safe down here.

04:04.811 --> 04:08.146
I meant you get a cookie, but, uh...
yeah, that's a good point too.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.983
Hey, could one of you hook
Norman up to the monitor

04:10.984 --> 04:13.785
in the adjoining lab so
we can set Spidey up here?

04:13.786 --> 04:18.351
[music]

04:26.166 --> 04:27.799
Mm...

04:29.836 --> 04:31.770
Okay. I've recreated the cure

04:31.805 --> 04:34.572
using the synthesized blood
and what was left of my serum.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.342
Now we can mass-produce it
without any fear of side effects.

04:37.377 --> 04:40.945
[sighs]
Great. Now what?

04:40.980 --> 04:43.982
Now you rest.
I'll check how the data readings

04:44.017 --> 04:46.318
are turning out
with Norman's tests.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.858
I really am sorry, Harry.

04:53.893 --> 04:56.261
Why did you keep this from me?

04:56.296 --> 04:58.263
You're supposed to be my best friend.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.999
And your dad's my worst enemy.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.535
I guess I just felt that if you
knew, you'd be put in a position

05:03.536 --> 05:06.037
to choose, and... I didn't
think that was fair to you.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.106
Well, I've got news for you, Pete.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.776
That may be what you tell
yourself, but it's not the truth.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.079
You may be right.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.384
I guess the truth is...
This isn't about you, Harry.

05:19.419 --> 05:21.553
It's also about Aunt May,

05:21.588 --> 05:25.156
about my friends at Horizon,
about everyone that's close to me.

05:25.191 --> 05:27.692
Because if my enemies
ever found out my secret,

05:27.727 --> 05:30.195
everything and everybody
I care about could be destroyed.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.871
Well, Spider-Man's done
a fine job of destroying

05:32.872 --> 05:34.632
my life since the day he arrived,

05:34.667 --> 05:37.135
so it hasn't made a bit of
difference whether I know or not.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.337
You even got me booted
from Horizon High.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.973
I told you,
I had nothing to do with that.

05:42.008 --> 05:45.844
Look, I couldn't tell you before
without revealing my secret, but...

05:45.879 --> 05:49.647
I saw security footage
of your dad and Spencer Smythe

05:49.682 --> 05:51.916
discussing their plan to get
you suspended from Horizon.

05:51.951 --> 05:55.887
Oh. [chuckles]
Where is this footage?

05:55.922 --> 05:59.758
It was destroyed in the Oz Academy
fire the day the Jackal attacked.

05:59.793 --> 06:03.728
Oh, great. And I can't very well
ask my father about it now, can I?

06:03.763 --> 06:05.930
'Cause your blood
left him unconscious!

06:05.965 --> 06:09.501
My blood is what cured him!
[thud]

06:09.536 --> 06:11.069
[thudding]

06:11.070 --> 06:12.670
[Harry] They found us!
[screeching]

06:13.706 --> 06:17.442
Protect your dad.
I'll save the cure! [grunts]

06:17.477 --> 06:20.912
[groans] You're in
no condition to fight.

06:20.947 --> 06:24.115
I just need time to recover.
[thudding continues]

06:24.150 --> 06:25.917
Don't worry.

06:25.952 --> 06:27.152
[screeching]

06:27.153 --> 06:30.121
You're not the only one
who can defend us.

06:30.156 --> 06:31.856
[grunting]

06:31.891 --> 06:34.292
[screeching]

06:36.262 --> 06:39.264

[screeching continues]

06:40.467 --> 06:41.467

Oh, whoa. So dizzy.

06:51.277 --> 06:52.877

06:54.147 --> 06:55.347

Looks like there's three of you.

07:01.321 --> 07:04.122
[grunts]

07:04.157 --> 07:06.758
There are three of them.
And more coming!

07:06.793 --> 07:08.026
[screeching]
Huh?

07:08.027 --> 07:09.627

[grunts, groans]

07:14.601 --> 07:17.235
- Anya, you all right?
- I'm okay.

07:17.270 --> 07:21.006
Good, 'cause we're gonna need
all the help we can get.

07:22.642 --> 07:24.176
[growling]

07:24.177 --> 07:25.944
Quick, in there!

07:29.215 --> 07:31.649

07:31.684 --> 07:33.852

Anybody got any ideas?

07:33.887 --> 07:36.254
[Miles] I've got one.
[screeching]

07:36.289 --> 07:38.022
Eat cure, ugly.

07:38.057 --> 07:39.525
[groaning weakly]

07:39.526 --> 07:42.093
[screeches, growls]

07:42.128 --> 07:45.804
- [Spider-Man] What was that?
- I took half of the cure

07:45.839 --> 07:47.232
into this lab
so we could produce it faster.

07:47.233 --> 07:51.340
Oh, my gosh, I could kiss you!
[sheepish chuckling]

07:51.375 --> 07:53.171
[Spider-Man] Let's not celebrate just yet.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.673
Those Spider-Monsters
are gonna find another way in.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.809
And we need to get the cure out
to the whole city.

07:57.844 --> 08:01.212
- And you need to have another cookie.
- No argument here.

08:01.247 --> 08:03.314
I think I've earned one too.

08:03.349 --> 08:05.984
Can we focus, please?
We may have a cure,

08:06.019 --> 08:07.986
but it's only half
of what we planned on.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.322
So every shot counts.
And with only one injector gun,

08:11.357 --> 08:14.025
we're gonna have to find new
ways to administer it effectively.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.728
Then let's get creative.

08:16.729 --> 08:20.175
[music]

08:20.867 --> 08:24.788
[crackling] These web
pellets should enable us

08:24.823 --> 08:26.238
to hit the monsters
without getting too close.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.706
And since those of us
with organic web shooters

08:28.741 --> 08:32.176
don't have the luxury of web
pellets, I'll use the injector gun.

08:32.211 --> 08:35.046
- I can use these.
- Whoa! Those are the bombs

08:35.081 --> 08:36.981
that were stolen
from your Horizon locker.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.918
These are containment capsules
for storing volatile liquids.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.488
When you're ready to release
the contents, you just change

08:42.489 --> 08:45.023
- the density setting of the casing.
- Sounds like a bomb to me.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.992
Fine. Call 'em "cure bombs,"
if you want.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.595
- But they'll do the job.
- Then let's get going.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.830
Wait. Are you sure
my dad's secure?

08:52.865 --> 08:57.702
I've placed him in a protective
life-support capsule until we get back.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.060
Wish me luck, Dad.

09:04.644 --> 09:06.611
<i>[Norman, weakly] Harry...</i>

09:06.646 --> 09:10.048
Dad?
Dad, don't try to talk.

09:10.083 --> 09:13.551
Just rest.
You're gonna be okay.

09:13.586 --> 09:17.456
We've got the cure, and we're gonna
stop the Jackal once and for all.

09:17.491 --> 09:19.845
[grunts weakly]

09:21.094 --> 09:23.695

<i>You're becoming the hero
I knew you could be.</i>

09:28.935 --> 09:31.136
Thanks, Dad.

09:33.344 --> 09:35.292
Let's do this.

09:35.293 --> 09:38.773
[music]

09:39.779 --> 09:42.146
[Spider-Man]
Congratulations, New York.

It's time for your complete makeover.

Ah, too late.

10:39.839 --> 10:43.508
[chittering]
[grunts]

10:43.543 --> 10:47.712
[grunts] The cure's working,
but we're barely making a dent.

10:47.747 --> 10:50.948
There are too many of them.
We need a faster way to do this.

10:50.983 --> 10:54.652
What about the dispersal unit Norman
used when he was the Stealth Spider?

10:54.687 --> 10:57.722
You mean the one he tried
to poison the city with?

10:57.757 --> 10:59.724
We don't know that's what
he was trying to do.

10:59.759 --> 11:02.994
And even if he was, he was
probably under the Jackal's control.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.847
Either way, do you think
your dad could help us

11:05.848 --> 11:08.666
- build one to cure the city?
- I don't think so.

11:08.701 --> 11:11.469
The transfusion has left him
incredibly weak.

11:11.504 --> 11:14.305
But if my dad can make one,
so can I.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.541
I just need to get
to my equipment at Oz Academy.

11:16.576 --> 11:19.143
Wait. We have to go back
to Oz Academy?

11:19.178 --> 11:23.147
How are we gonna do that?
The place is crawling with monsters.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.183
I know a way.

11:28.755 --> 11:30.988
[Miles] I don't know if you
know this, but Oz Academy

11:31.023 --> 11:34.058
is at the very top of the Oscorp
building, not at the very bottom.

11:34.093 --> 11:37.261
I know. But what I'm looking
for should help get us up there.

11:37.296 --> 11:41.099
My father feared the spider army
before it even existed.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.067
[beeping]

11:43.102 --> 11:45.937
He tried to prevent it.
In the event he couldn't,

11:45.972 --> 11:47.739
he created something to fight it.

11:47.774 --> 11:51.442
- The spider slayers!
- Aww, yeah!

11:51.477 --> 11:53.945
I spent enough time battling
these things from the outside.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.247
Sure is gonna be nice
fighting from the inside.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.916
We should combine
what we have left of the cure

11:58.951 --> 12:00.952
so Harry can load it
into the dispersal unit.

12:00.987 --> 12:03.554
Good idea.
Anything else we need to do?

12:03.589 --> 12:05.734
Yeah. Suit up.

12:06.643 --> 12:11.686

[computers trilling]

12:31.250 --> 12:35.120
- Let's go stop some monsters.
- [Miles] Roger that.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.328
Where are the bodies
of the spider men?

12:45.965 --> 12:47.499
[Spider-Man] Top floor.
Swimwear,

12:47.500 --> 12:50.001
sporting goods, and...
oh, yeah... [gasps, growls]

12:50.036 --> 12:53.471
massive monster beatdowns!

12:55.541 --> 12:57.475
[Spider-Man]
Set your blasters to stun!

12:57.510 --> 12:59.110
Attack!

13:00.346 --> 13:02.446
[screeching, growling]

13:02.481 --> 13:04.682
[Spider-Man]
Aah! Get off, get off, get off!

13:04.717 --> 13:07.557
[Miles]
Oh, I'll do better than that.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.021
[Anya] Save the cure
for the dispersal unit.

13:10.056 --> 13:14.358
- We'll need every bit of it.
- [Miles] This is better than video games.

13:14.393 --> 13:16.527
[Harry] Distract them
while I head for the lab!

13:16.562 --> 13:20.832
"Distract them"? How about I give
them a taste of their own webbing?

13:25.404 --> 13:28.206
[Miles] Hey! Get off me!

13:28.241 --> 13:30.208
[Spider-Man] "Get off me"?
Doesn't that slayer

13:30.243 --> 13:32.443
come equipped
with wittier responses?

13:32.478 --> 13:36.648
No. But it comes equipped
with booster rockets. [beeps]

13:42.421 --> 13:46.057
[grunts] That was not what
I wanted to do. [chittering]

13:49.395 --> 13:51.495
[screeches]
[Anya yells]

13:51.530 --> 13:53.497
[pants] Thanks.

13:53.532 --> 13:56.427
[grunts]
I owed you for saving me earlier.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.437
I'm in the lab.
[chittering]

13:59.438 --> 14:02.073
Where are those dispensers?
Uh-oh! [screeching]

14:02.108 --> 14:03.575
[grunts]

14:03.576 --> 14:05.677
[chitters, screeches]

14:08.381 --> 14:10.949
[grunts]

14:12.785 --> 14:14.385
[Anya] Hey!

14:14.420 --> 14:16.487
[screeching]

14:16.522 --> 14:18.489
[alarm blares]
I've lost my left arm!

14:18.524 --> 14:21.893
[grunting]

14:21.928 --> 14:24.095
[laughing]
[Spider-Man] Watch it, Jackal!

14:24.130 --> 14:26.330
This thing's a rental.
Uh-oh! [alarm blaring]

14:26.365 --> 14:28.332
Someone's about
to lose their head!

14:28.367 --> 14:31.168
[yells, grunts]

14:31.203 --> 14:33.371
Guess I'm drivin'
with the top down!

14:33.406 --> 14:36.073
This is the last one
of these combustion funnels,

14:36.108 --> 14:38.743
so we'd better make this count.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.878
Done!

14:40.913 --> 14:44.148
[suit whirring]

14:45.818 --> 14:48.719
Oh, no! Boosters must've
been damaged in the fight.

14:48.754 --> 14:52.456
I've got it,
but my tech is down!

14:52.491 --> 14:55.359
[screeching]
Package is secure!

14:55.394 --> 14:56.561
[screeching]

14:56.562 --> 14:58.630
[Anya] Not yet, it isn't.

15:00.833 --> 15:04.511
Fly it up here.
We'll disperse it from the roof.

15:06.005 --> 15:08.306
[screeching]
[grunts]

15:08.341 --> 15:09.941
[grunts]

15:14.280 --> 15:16.280
Nice try, Osborn.
[groans]

15:16.315 --> 15:21.703
But your father failed to stop me,
and now you will too!

15:23.923 --> 15:26.891
[Spider-Man] No!

15:26.926 --> 15:30.995
Clever plan, using the
spider slayers, by the way.

15:31.030 --> 15:34.598
[grunting]
[screeching]

15:34.633 --> 15:37.902
[descending whirring]
Huh?

15:37.937 --> 15:42.440
But even Norman Osborn has
a fail-safe against his own creations.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.676
Feeling a little heavy, Spider-Man?

15:45.711 --> 15:48.846
That's because I cut
the power to your suits.

15:48.881 --> 15:54.485
Turned those precious slayers
into your own personal tombs.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.854
I have to hand it to Norman.
[Spider-Monsters chittering]

15:56.889 --> 16:01.359
Many brilliant things were created
here at the Oscorp building.

16:01.394 --> 16:05.680
Sadly, future generations
will only know it as...

16:05.681 --> 16:09.640
the Oscorp crater!
[trilling]

16:10.302 --> 16:12.603
<i>[computer] 59, 58,</i>

16:12.638 --> 16:14.538
<i>- 57, 56...
- He's gonna blow the building!</i>

16:14.573 --> 16:18.542
- ...55, 54, 53...
- This dwelling has outlasted its use.

16:18.577 --> 16:21.545
- ...52, 51, 50...
- Much like the rest of you.

16:21.580 --> 16:25.449
Good-bye, Spider-Man!

16:25.484 --> 16:27.651
[countdown continues, faint]

16:27.686 --> 16:29.020
[grunts]

16:29.021 --> 16:31.622
I'll have you guys out in a second.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.992
[grunts]

16:35.494 --> 16:38.196
Don't bother.
I can do it myself.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.669
There's gotta be a way
to shut Jackal's bomb down.

16:45.704 --> 16:48.472
[trilling] Ugh!
If only Gwen were here!

16:48.507 --> 16:51.575
She could probably defuse
this thing faster any of us!

16:51.610 --> 16:54.045
I don't think so.
This has too many encryptions.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.480
It would take a genius with
a lot more time than we have.

16:56.515 --> 17:01.252
- Let me give it a shot.
- There's no time, Harry.

17:01.287 --> 17:03.587
Oh, and you're smarter
than the rest of us?

17:03.622 --> 17:06.057
No. I'm just saying,
[keyboard clacking]

17:06.092 --> 17:09.326
if we don't get out of here now,
we'll spread it all over the...

17:09.361 --> 17:11.361
the city!

17:13.132 --> 17:15.900
- What are you doing?
- Grabbing what's left of the cure.

17:15.935 --> 17:20.454
If we can't stop this bomb, then
let's use it to our advantage.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.374
Harry, listen!

17:23.409 --> 17:26.109
An explosion caused the spider
virus to become airborne,

17:26.145 --> 17:29.280
so another explosion could spread
the cure the exact same way.

17:29.315 --> 17:30.915
But what about Oz Academy?

17:30.950 --> 17:33.784
I'm sorry, Harry.
It's our only option.

17:33.819 --> 17:36.754
No, it's not!
I'm still an option.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.123
I can save this school, and this city.

17:39.158 --> 17:42.426
The people!
Guys, listen.

17:42.428 --> 17:45.429
Get these people out of here
while I rig the cure.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.631
[trilling]

17:47.666 --> 17:50.234
[grunts] I'm through
another layer of security!

17:50.269 --> 17:52.536
[countdown continues, faint]

17:52.571 --> 17:55.639
Harry, I could really use your help
getting these people out of here.

17:55.674 --> 17:59.743
And I could really use your help
being quiet while I disarm this thing.

17:59.778 --> 18:01.645
- 23...
- This is everyone.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.448
- ...22, 21, 20...
- Almost everyone. I'll meet you down there.

18:04.483 --> 18:07.318
- I'm gonna hold you to it.
- ...19, 18,

18:07.353 --> 18:09.553
- 17, 16...
- I'm just about there.

18:09.588 --> 18:13.809
- We've got to go, Harry.
- I can't. I can't lose everything

18:13.844 --> 18:15.293
- my father worked so hard to build.
- ...13, 12...

18:15.294 --> 18:17.628
- You have to.
- ...11, 10...

18:17.663 --> 18:21.265
- Now, Harry!
- No. I... [grunts]

18:21.300 --> 18:24.468
<i>...six, five, four, three,</i>

18:24.503 --> 18:26.704
<i>[Harry screaming]
two, one.</i>

18:28.709 --> 18:31.358
[boom]

18:36.815 --> 18:37.849
[yells]

18:37.850 --> 18:41.152
[both grunt]

18:41.187 --> 18:42.687
[grunts]

18:42.688 --> 18:46.090
[fire crackling]
[sighs] Why did you stop me?!

18:46.125 --> 18:48.292
Because you would've been killed!

18:48.327 --> 18:51.695
I could've done it!
I could've been the hero this time!

18:51.730 --> 18:54.870
But you couldn't
stand that, could you?

18:55.801 --> 18:58.802
[sighs]
And now it's gone.

18:58.837 --> 19:04.035
Everything... gone.

19:06.645 --> 19:10.248
It's working, Harry.
The cure is airborne.

19:10.249 --> 19:14.852
- We saved the city.
- No. You saved the city.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.188
And you destroyed Oz Academy!

19:17.223 --> 19:20.491
Literally wiped my name
from the sky!

19:20.526 --> 19:25.596
- Harry, I...
- Go away! You got what you wanted!

19:32.871 --> 19:35.706
[chittering, screeching]

19:43.282 --> 19:44.882
[grunts weakly]

19:44.883 --> 19:47.851
[people murmuring]

19:47.886 --> 19:50.465
[gasps]
Gwen!

19:55.527 --> 19:57.127
[grunts softly]

19:58.931 --> 20:02.666
I gotta say, I prefer New York
without Spider-Monsters.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.436
[grunts]
We did it, guys.

20:05.471 --> 20:11.471
- Where's Harry?
- I... I think he's checking on his dad.

20:20.552 --> 20:24.305
I tried, Dad.
I could've saved the school,

20:24.306 --> 20:28.859
- but Spider-Man stopped me.
- Not to worry. [music]

20:28.894 --> 20:30.861
We're lucky it was just the school

20:30.896 --> 20:34.732
- and not the entire building.
- But Oz Academy...

20:34.767 --> 20:37.301
my work! Our legacy!

20:39.605 --> 20:43.341
There can be no beginnings
without endings, son.

20:44.343 --> 20:47.544
Besides...
[trills]

20:47.579 --> 20:51.430
- you no longer need the school.
- Wha...

20:51.850 --> 20:54.518
You've graduated.

21:04.598 --> 21:06.698
[music]

21:06.699 --> 21:08.799
<i>[Spider-Man] Welcome to New York City.</i>

21:08.834 --> 21:11.902
<i>Population: eight million people.</i>

21:11.937 --> 21:15.406
<i>Which is different from yesterday, when
it was eight million Spider-Monsters.</i>

21:15.441 --> 21:17.574
<i>So I'd say that's
a change for the better.</i>

21:17.609 --> 21:20.411
<i>I know Harry is crushed
that his school was destroyed.</i>

21:20.446 --> 21:23.681
<i>Hopefully the lives he saved
should help balance that out.</i>

21:23.716 --> 21:26.884
<i>'Cause it's not the things
in life that are important.</i>
