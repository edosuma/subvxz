WEBVTT

00:17.250 --> 00:19.875
Get away. Next time I won't miss.

00:22.916 --> 00:24.750
-My name is Jenny.
-What do you want?

00:24.833 --> 00:25.750
To help you.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.916
Please. You don't wanna do that.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.541
Lidia, please let me help you.

00:31.625 --> 00:33.791
Nobody can help me.

00:33.875 --> 00:35.208
I know you're upset.

00:35.291 --> 00:37.208
Stop talking like we're friends!

00:37.291 --> 00:40.458
I know that what happened
in the church was not your fault.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.000
It was my fault.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.083
That wasn't you.

00:44.166 --> 00:46.708
I know this is gonna sound crazy.

00:46.791 --> 00:49.208
But somebody was controlling your mind.

00:49.291 --> 00:50.416
Same with Miguel.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.083
What?

00:54.750 --> 00:56.416
No.

01:05.458 --> 01:06.583
How old are you?

01:08.041 --> 01:09.875
You can't be older than 20, 21?

01:11.333 --> 01:13.041
You have your whole life ahead of you.

01:13.125 --> 01:15.625
-My life is over.
-It doesn't have to be.

01:19.208 --> 01:20.791
Tell me what happened.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.583
Tell me what you remember.

01:26.166 --> 01:28.000
I was… I was in the room.

01:30.625 --> 01:32.916
Getting ready with my bridesmaids.

01:35.166 --> 01:36.541
And then I heard music.

01:38.666 --> 01:41.125
Like someone was humming.

01:42.583 --> 01:43.833
And it scared me.

01:50.875 --> 01:53.083
<i>And I felt like I was drowning.</i>

01:54.250 --> 01:56.833
<i>I couldn't move, couldn't blink.</i>

01:58.916 --> 02:00.583
<i>And I felt something,</i>

02:01.416 --> 02:04.458
<i>or maybe it was someone above me.</i>

02:06.291 --> 02:07.375
<i>Watching.</i>

02:10.541 --> 02:12.000
And then I woke up.

02:14.291 --> 02:17.625
And I was so scared. I just ran. I just…

02:20.791 --> 02:21.875
And you're clear now?

02:24.500 --> 02:25.708
You mean myself?

02:27.958 --> 02:29.041
Yeah, I think so.

02:31.958 --> 02:33.541
How do you know Yannick Mair?

02:34.708 --> 02:36.958
He is a guy who told us to deliver

02:37.041 --> 02:39.625
Temple of Debod's
security details to Puoco Franco.

02:39.708 --> 02:40.750
Who's Puoco Franco?

03:17.375 --> 03:18.750
Lidia, run!

03:22.041 --> 03:24.000
-Forget it! Let's go!

03:28.958 --> 03:29.875
No!

03:36.958 --> 03:38.541
The attacker's getting away.

03:38.625 --> 03:40.208
Let 'em. We need to find her.

03:43.125 --> 03:45.625
-Jenny!
-Jenny, can you hear me?

03:49.208 --> 03:52.208
-Where the hell did she go?
-She should be right here.

03:52.291 --> 03:53.958
Chris, we've got a blood trail.

03:55.875 --> 03:56.750
Jenny.

04:02.958 --> 04:04.041
Chauncey.

04:08.791 --> 04:10.708
Wait, we just came this way.

04:11.291 --> 04:12.791
Where the hell did she come from?

04:14.625 --> 04:15.541
Jenny?

04:28.833 --> 04:31.291
Who the fuck
were those guys at the cemetery?

04:31.375 --> 04:32.791
I wish I knew.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.708
-Ow.
-Then hold still.

04:39.375 --> 04:41.000
It's a good thing I heal fast.

04:44.208 --> 04:45.791
Where did you learn how to do that?

04:46.500 --> 04:50.000
Air Force Special Forces.
Pararescue. Two tours in Afghanistan.

04:52.291 --> 04:53.375
Oh, really?

04:53.458 --> 04:55.083
-No witty comeback?

04:57.041 --> 04:58.791
It's hard not to see you as a suit.

04:59.416 --> 05:01.750
Just goes to show
how little you know about me.

05:03.375 --> 05:04.625
Okay. All done.

05:04.708 --> 05:07.583
Keep it covered tonight
and you can take it off tomorrow.

05:17.666 --> 05:20.333
I guess you're waiting
on some obligatory "thank you"?

05:20.416 --> 05:23.166
I did just stitch your ass back together.

05:23.250 --> 05:25.500
This wouldn't happen
if you said where you were going.

05:25.583 --> 05:27.750
I don't need to be babysat.

05:27.833 --> 05:29.500
I can't protect you if I don't know.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.125
You mean you can't monitor me.

05:31.708 --> 05:33.083
Help you.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.208
How did you know
I'd be at the cemetery tonight?

05:36.041 --> 05:38.916
I'm the CIA.
As unimpressive as that might be to you--

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Thank you.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.875
There. I said it.

05:47.833 --> 05:49.583
What happened at the cemetery?

05:49.666 --> 05:51.250
Besides getting my ass kicked?

05:51.333 --> 05:55.708
You know what I mean.
We found you naked, curled up in a ball.

05:57.250 --> 06:01.250
I was losing a lot of blood
so I went into Camo-mode.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.416
Camo-mode?

06:03.333 --> 06:07.041
I didn't read anything
about a Camo-mode in the Yaroslav Program.

06:07.583 --> 06:09.916
It's part of my body morphing ability.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.458
I can camouflage my skin
by bending light around me.

06:13.666 --> 06:18.041
Is that it, or is there
something else you're not telling me?

06:18.125 --> 06:20.541
Another superpower you're withholding?

06:21.125 --> 06:23.000
My nipples light up when I am scared.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.208
-Really?
-No.

06:27.041 --> 06:28.125
Seriously?

06:28.208 --> 06:29.958
Oh, that's… Okay.

06:30.041 --> 06:33.500
What about the body morphing?
How does that work exactly?

06:33.583 --> 06:35.583
The biomechanics of it? I don't know.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.166
Your guess is as good as mine.

06:40.125 --> 06:41.416
All I know is…

06:46.208 --> 06:47.750
when I touch somebody's skin,

06:48.666 --> 06:50.250
I collect their DNA.

06:51.791 --> 06:53.083
And I can become them.

06:54.458 --> 06:55.833
Hey, guys, come here.

07:01.458 --> 07:02.583
Fuck.

07:02.666 --> 07:04.708
You're looking at 77 names.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.041
All registered owners

07:06.125 --> 07:08.250
of BMW Alpina B5s
in the Madrid metro area.

07:08.333 --> 07:11.458
-Any of 'em green?
-Twenty-four. I called all 24 owners.

07:11.541 --> 07:12.541
They all check out.

07:12.625 --> 07:15.000
I don't think
our car's registered in this city.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.583
-What about aerial footage?
-None.

07:16.666 --> 07:18.333
A restaurant security camera

07:18.416 --> 07:21.041
caught a car
about two blocks south of the cemetery.

07:21.125 --> 07:22.958
But I couldn't get a license plate.

07:23.541 --> 07:25.458
So that leaves us where exactly?

07:25.541 --> 07:28.875
Nowhere. But I tracked down Lidia once.
I can do it again.

07:28.958 --> 07:31.125
You're in no condition
to go back out tonight.

07:31.208 --> 07:32.791
She's three years older than Becca.

07:32.875 --> 07:34.500
I know.

07:34.583 --> 07:36.833
But we both know,
whoever those guys were tonight,

07:36.916 --> 07:38.750
they're not going to leave any witnesses.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.500
Lidia's already dead.

07:46.958 --> 07:48.625
I should have saved her.

07:48.708 --> 07:50.041
It wasn't your fault.

07:50.125 --> 07:53.125
That's exactly
what I said to Lidia.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.416
You know, two days ago,

07:58.500 --> 08:00.666
you couldn't give
a fuck less about any of this.

08:00.750 --> 08:02.916
And now, look at you.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.083
You're all in.

08:05.791 --> 08:08.208
Being all in
is the only way we get out of this mess.

08:08.291 --> 08:10.875
Or you actually give a shit.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.583
You don't know me at all.

08:25.416 --> 08:26.791
Show me again.

08:26.875 --> 08:28.833
Yes, I'd like to order a dinner please.

08:30.750 --> 08:33.041
Yes. I'd like a rib eye.

08:34.875 --> 08:37.125
Make that two orders of the rib eye.

08:38.416 --> 08:41.166
And some potatoes.

08:42.291 --> 08:43.583
And broccoli.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.458
And I'm gonna need some ice.

08:49.250 --> 08:50.416
Ten buckets full.

09:44.458 --> 09:47.375
I still can't believe
you found my pendant.

09:48.208 --> 09:50.000
<i>I know how much it means to you.</i>

09:54.708 --> 09:55.541
You okay?

09:56.291 --> 09:57.166
You got quiet.

09:58.041 --> 10:00.416
<i>If by "okay" you mean freezing my ass off…</i>

10:01.875 --> 10:03.208
<i>Then, yes, I'm okay.</i>

10:04.250 --> 10:07.875
You do have a nice ass.

10:08.958 --> 10:12.583
<i>My ass is boring.</i>
<i>Just round like an apple.</i>

10:12.666 --> 10:16.000
I like apples. They're good to bite.

10:26.791 --> 10:28.500
I have a surprise for you.

10:30.416 --> 10:32.000
<i>What kind of surprise?</i>

10:32.083 --> 10:34.750
<i>No fair. I didn't get you anything.</i>

10:34.833 --> 10:39.250
It's cool. I just thought of it.
That's why it's called a surprise.

10:39.333 --> 10:40.958
<i>I don't think that's how surprises work.</i>

10:41.041 --> 10:43.666
<i>They're not supposed to be</i>
<i>a surprise to both of us.</i>

10:43.750 --> 10:46.333
You talk way too much.

10:50.375 --> 10:51.375
<i>Do you see me?</i>

10:51.458 --> 10:54.083
I'm pretty sure
the whole neighborhood can see you.

10:57.291 --> 10:58.416
<i>Wait. Hang on.</i>

11:08.041 --> 11:09.458
<i>Surprise.</i>

11:10.041 --> 11:11.375
You're beautiful.

11:13.416 --> 11:15.250
Do you really think so?

11:16.125 --> 11:18.750
The most beautiful woman
I've seen in my entire life.

11:24.458 --> 11:25.916
I'm falling in love with you…

11:31.333 --> 11:33.500
<i>You still there?</i>

11:35.208 --> 11:36.291
Yeah. I'm here.

11:49.458 --> 11:53.291
Those optic cameras
in Jenny's eyes are worth every penny.

11:53.375 --> 11:55.416
Until she finds out and kills your ass.

12:00.666 --> 12:02.208
You know who they are, don't you?

12:02.291 --> 12:03.916
They call themselves "Jackals."

12:04.000 --> 12:05.541
Government-sanctioned?

12:05.625 --> 12:06.791
Mercenaries.

12:06.875 --> 12:09.333
They pimp out
their services to the highest bidder.

12:11.541 --> 12:13.625
You think they're the guys
from back in Marseille?

12:13.708 --> 12:15.291
That's what I'm thinking.

12:17.458 --> 12:20.291
So you're right. We're close, man.

12:20.375 --> 12:22.916
Close only counts
in horseshoes and hand grenades.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.208
I'm gonna scan their images
into INTERPOL's database to see if I can…

12:28.125 --> 12:30.583
I just got hit on one of 'em.
Look at this.

12:32.125 --> 12:33.916
Let's see what we've got here.

12:36.083 --> 12:38.958
Carmo Valter, 26, from Deià.

12:39.041 --> 12:42.041
Dishonorably discharged
from Special Forces.

12:42.125 --> 12:43.333
Based in Alicante.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.375
And look at this.

12:47.375 --> 12:50.000
See that? Look at that
right there on his right hand.

12:50.083 --> 12:51.458
-Can you blow it up?
-Yeah.

12:53.666 --> 12:55.333
It looks like a fresh brand.

12:55.416 --> 12:57.000
It's called an "artistic scar."

12:57.833 --> 13:00.541
Taking a hot iron onto your skin
isn't artistic, it's stupid.

13:00.625 --> 13:03.500
No, maybe
it's a gang thing or a street tag.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.125
It's too detailed to be a tag.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.000
Then what?

13:08.958 --> 13:11.583
I'm not sure. But I know who to ask.

13:13.666 --> 13:15.666
Tell me you're not
doing what I think you are.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.000
I've known him a long time.

13:17.083 --> 13:19.166
It's still a bad idea, Chauncey.

13:21.625 --> 13:23.125
You're gonna have to trust me.

13:25.458 --> 13:26.375
Chauncey.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.583
So you heard that from Sydney's mom?

13:31.666 --> 13:35.000
No. I heard it
from Sydney's mom's best friend, Deidra.

13:35.083 --> 13:39.041
Look, I'm not one to gossip,
but she hit it with the coach.

13:39.125 --> 13:41.000
-No.
-You didn't hear that from me though.

13:42.541 --> 13:48.041
Okay, here you have all three dishes.

13:50.250 --> 13:51.500
Excuse me.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.208
And a dish of lentil soup.

13:55.291 --> 13:56.541
I ordered the lentils.

13:56.625 --> 13:57.541
Enjoy.

13:57.625 --> 13:58.541
<i>Gracias.</i>

14:02.958 --> 14:05.333
-Oh, my God. What the fuck?
-Jesus.

14:06.750 --> 14:09.208
-Claire, chill out.
-What's going on over here?

14:09.291 --> 14:11.958
-Claire, what's the matter? What is?
-Disgusting!

14:17.500 --> 14:18.500
Gross.

14:21.416 --> 14:25.375
It's all right, girls. I'll get a manager.
I need to speak to a manager, please.

14:26.125 --> 14:28.208
Look, it's probably an accident.

14:28.291 --> 14:30.166
These things
happen in kitchens all the time.

14:30.250 --> 14:31.208
-An accident?
-What?

14:31.291 --> 14:33.250
They're not serving
that kind of bird here.

14:33.333 --> 14:35.250
No. Somebody did this shit on purpose.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.291
-Who'd do something like that?
-Who else? One of the other teams.

14:38.375 --> 14:40.083
They're trying to shake the girls.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.250
Claire. Claire!

14:45.291 --> 14:46.458
Girls, it's fine.

14:47.666 --> 14:49.083
Where's the manager?

14:55.083 --> 14:57.583
-Are you for real, Mad?
-Tell me you didn't do it.

14:57.666 --> 14:58.875
Okay. I didn't do it.

14:58.958 --> 15:03.166
Becca, you put a fucking bird skeleton
in Claire's <i>lentejas</i> soup.

15:03.250 --> 15:07.208
Sorry, it's just funny
that you said <i>lentejas</i> instead of lentil.

15:10.458 --> 15:11.833
Bitch.

15:12.416 --> 15:13.291
Slut.

15:13.875 --> 15:15.958
You gave me dead bird earrings.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.375
Well, if it helps,
I don't think it suffered much.

15:18.458 --> 15:19.625
RIP, dead bird.

15:20.916 --> 15:22.125
These are pretty dope, though.

15:23.166 --> 15:24.291
They look cool on you.

15:24.375 --> 15:25.708
Of course they do.

15:26.875 --> 15:28.625
You're a motherfuckin' boss, B.

15:29.208 --> 15:30.125
You too.

15:30.208 --> 15:32.958
And Claire Reed
has officially been canceled.

15:34.958 --> 15:36.208
-Bye.
-Bye.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.333
Davi.

15:56.750 --> 15:57.833
How's it going?

15:58.875 --> 16:00.291
Good. Can't complain.

16:00.375 --> 16:04.750
You know, I almost forgot
how beautiful this part of the park is.

16:08.833 --> 16:09.833
How's Valeria?

16:10.875 --> 16:12.125
Small talk now? Come on.

16:13.500 --> 16:18.375
Valeria and I are Facebook friends,
so I know you two had a kid.

16:19.333 --> 16:20.208
Congrats.

16:20.791 --> 16:23.416
Yeah. Well,
I gotta get her off the damn thing.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.208
And he got Valeria's looks too, I see.

16:26.958 --> 16:27.791
Thank God.

16:29.833 --> 16:32.833
I gotta tell you, Chauncey.
I was surprised to hear from you.

16:34.291 --> 16:38.375
Last thing I heard was the Agency
disavowed you. What, a year ago?

16:38.458 --> 16:40.500
Wouldn't touch you with a ten-foot pole.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.208
It's not what it seems.

16:42.291 --> 16:43.375
Yeah, never is.

16:44.250 --> 16:45.375
So, tell me.

16:45.458 --> 16:47.708
If you ain't with the Agency,
who you with?

16:48.291 --> 16:49.916
Maybe I'm working solo.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.833
You gotta tell me more than that.

16:51.916 --> 16:54.083
How about you owe me? How's that?

16:54.166 --> 16:55.916
I owe the CIA, Chauncey.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.041
Then call it a professional courtesy.

16:59.875 --> 17:01.083
What do you want?

17:01.166 --> 17:02.041
Your opinion.

17:03.583 --> 17:04.583
Take a look at this.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.666
What kind of brand do you think that is?

17:10.541 --> 17:12.291
There's a group in Madrid using it.

17:12.375 --> 17:14.291
You know, to trademark their shit.

17:14.875 --> 17:15.875
What kind of shit?

17:17.166 --> 17:18.041
Drugs.

17:19.916 --> 17:21.666
Weed, heroin, cocaine, what?

17:22.416 --> 17:24.666
Meth. On the street,
it's called "Puoco Franco."

17:24.750 --> 17:27.625
You know, this symbol's
pretty much like their Nike logo.

17:27.708 --> 17:29.541
Word is, it's premium party shit.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.125
Relax.

17:33.958 --> 17:35.125
It's a jogger.

17:36.666 --> 17:37.916
I'm always relaxed, Davi.

17:39.166 --> 17:43.208
But thank you for your help with this.
And congratulations on the new baby.

17:44.458 --> 17:47.500
Right. Please stop stalking
my wife and my baby on Facebook.

17:47.583 --> 17:49.500
You know, it's kind of creepy.

17:54.041 --> 17:55.625
<i>All right, Chris, what do you got?</i>

17:55.708 --> 17:58.166
I've scaled down Puoco Franco's
sales/distribution markets

17:58.250 --> 17:59.875
in four different neighborhoods.

18:00.625 --> 18:04.833
Argüelles, Lavapiés,
La Latina, and Malasaña.

18:04.916 --> 18:07.333
As you can see,
each hood has its own version

18:07.416 --> 18:09.166
of the Puoco Franco street tag.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.666
They're all similar,
but have subtle differences.

18:11.750 --> 18:13.666
Which neighborhood gets most drug traffic?

18:13.750 --> 18:14.666
Malasaña.

18:14.750 --> 18:18.041
You got your college kids,
bars, restaurants.

18:18.125 --> 18:19.541
A lot of foot traffic there.

18:19.625 --> 18:23.333
These guys are just standing
on a corner under Puoco Franco signs?

18:23.416 --> 18:25.208
If you know what to look for, sure.

18:25.291 --> 18:27.166
That's how
they can operate in plain sight.

18:27.250 --> 18:29.916
These ain't your ordinary
corner boys in hoodies and jeans.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.250
These are college kids in polos.

18:33.791 --> 18:37.333
Lidia gave Temple of Debod's
security intel to a Puoco Franco.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.750
But she could've
given it to any of these kids

18:39.833 --> 18:43.291
since Puoco Franco
is not an actual person.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.500
Puoco Franco money buys them Yannick,

18:47.333 --> 18:49.458
-a guy with connections.
-Mm-hm.

18:49.541 --> 18:52.333
And I went through Yannick's bank records.

18:52.416 --> 18:55.041
A hundred thousand euros
was deposited into his account

18:55.125 --> 18:56.291
after all four attacks.

18:56.375 --> 19:00.000
Maybe Yannick promised the victims
a cut in exchange for security intel.

19:00.083 --> 19:01.291
I mean, if he did,

19:01.375 --> 19:03.708
there isn't a record
of them ever getting paid.

19:03.791 --> 19:07.125
Yannick promises desperate people
money in exchange for information.

19:08.041 --> 19:09.541
Only, it's a one-way exchange.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.875
That's how no one
can connect them to the terrorist plot.

19:12.958 --> 19:15.000
If we find out
who's distributing this stuff,

19:16.041 --> 19:17.166
we got our terrorist.

19:22.875 --> 19:24.083
I'm going to Malasaňa.

19:25.291 --> 19:27.375
Okay. I'll get you what you need.

19:27.458 --> 19:30.458
As long as it's not
one of your male fantasy superhero suits.

19:38.916 --> 19:39.875
Okay.

19:43.625 --> 19:45.208
It's not a big deal.

19:58.291 --> 19:59.666
You can do this.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.416
I've often wondered…

20:54.166 --> 20:55.958
Where have you been, Su-Yin?

21:01.333 --> 21:02.375
You little pervert.

21:09.250 --> 21:11.000
<i>All is going as planned.</i>

21:11.083 --> 21:13.041
<i>This girl is falling in love with you.</i>

21:13.833 --> 21:16.041
<i>Soon, you will get inside</i>
<i>the Chinese Embassy and--</i>

21:16.125 --> 21:17.416
Something is wrong.

21:18.291 --> 21:19.125
<i>Wrong?</i>

21:19.916 --> 21:21.250
I'm being followed.

22:34.583 --> 22:35.958
Who sent you?

22:36.041 --> 22:38.250
Listen… I will tell you everything.

22:38.333 --> 22:39.750
Then tell me. Now.

22:39.833 --> 22:41.500
-Please, I beg of you.
<i>-Nyet.</i>

22:46.250 --> 22:47.500
I swear to you.

23:05.625 --> 23:08.208
Now, tell me what I want to know.

23:44.208 --> 23:45.791
You should've killed him.

23:47.291 --> 23:48.500
I was going to.

23:49.375 --> 23:52.291
You should've done it
the moment he blew your cover.

23:53.208 --> 23:55.541
For all you know,
he could be counterintelligence.

23:55.625 --> 23:57.416
I didn't need your help.

23:58.583 --> 24:00.125
You should be thanking me.

24:00.208 --> 24:03.250
He was going to tell me
who he worked for, who sent him.

24:03.875 --> 24:06.583
You fool. He was going to kill you.

24:07.958 --> 24:09.416
What is the mission protocol?

24:10.250 --> 24:13.958
Shoot first. Don't ask questions.

24:37.875 --> 24:39.375
He wasn't counterintelligence.

24:40.625 --> 24:42.291
He's SVR. He's one of us.

24:42.375 --> 24:44.375
Yes. And now he's dead.

25:41.625 --> 25:42.458
Hey.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.291
You need to go home and get sobered up.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
-Tomás can be my wingman--
-Fuck Tomás.

25:49.125 --> 25:50.416
Yeah, I'm here.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.916
I just smoked a little marijuana.

25:53.625 --> 25:54.500
That's all.

25:57.666 --> 26:01.500
You said you wanted me to teach
you the business from the ground up.

26:01.583 --> 26:03.333
Same as Uncle Felipe taught me.

26:04.041 --> 26:06.500
How am I
supposed to do that if you're high?

26:06.583 --> 26:07.916
Think a little, man.

26:09.791 --> 26:12.333
I thought you wanted
Uncle Felipe to take you seriously.

26:14.333 --> 26:16.000
I'm not his favorite.

26:22.708 --> 26:24.291
You know why I'm his favorite?

26:25.791 --> 26:27.125
Because I stepped up.

26:28.875 --> 26:30.041
Just like Dad.

26:34.625 --> 26:37.000
Dad didn't want us doing this.

26:40.375 --> 26:41.208
Maybe not.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.500
But Uncle Felipe
knows what's best for us now. Hmm?

26:49.416 --> 26:50.375
You're right.

26:54.041 --> 26:55.083
<i>Lo siento.</i>

27:00.416 --> 27:02.333
You're my brother, Diego.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.291
There's nothing to be sorry about.

27:31.333 --> 27:32.541
You the guy selling it?

27:34.791 --> 27:36.041
Depends on what <i>it</i> is.

27:36.833 --> 27:38.333
Puoco Franco.

27:44.291 --> 27:45.625
How much?

27:45.708 --> 27:47.375
I'll pay whatever you want, mate.

27:49.166 --> 27:50.791
"How much" means how many baggies.

27:51.541 --> 27:52.666
Are you an idiot, man?

27:52.750 --> 27:54.291
Look, man, I'm cool. Yeah?

27:54.375 --> 27:55.291
I'll get a baggie.

27:56.333 --> 27:58.416
Three hundred. You pay or get lost.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.500
No problem. I got it.

28:05.291 --> 28:06.458
Where're you from?

28:07.041 --> 28:09.750
London. Moved here a
couple months ago for uni.

28:09.833 --> 28:11.666
Roommate got me hooked on the stuff.

28:12.625 --> 28:15.291
Somebody's sitting
on some serious pile of cash I bet.

28:16.291 --> 28:18.208
Puoco Franco's hot shit right now.

28:18.291 --> 28:20.125
Look, man, all I'm saying is,

28:20.208 --> 28:23.958
if you're looking for some help
expanding your distribution, I'm your guy.

28:36.250 --> 28:38.958
As you can see, we are all full.

28:40.750 --> 28:41.666
Worth a try.

28:44.791 --> 28:45.791
Get in.

28:54.833 --> 28:56.083
Check it out.

28:56.166 --> 28:59.666
Looks like our micro-threaded euros
just made it to the Barrio De Las Letras.

28:59.750 --> 29:01.250
That was a genius idea.

29:01.833 --> 29:03.500
Embedding the tracker in the money.

29:03.583 --> 29:05.708
-That's 'cause I'm money.
-Mm-hm.

29:05.791 --> 29:08.833
Davi was right
about the purity level of Puoco Franco.

29:08.916 --> 29:11.666
This has to be at least 95%.

29:11.750 --> 29:15.291
It better be,
considering a dime bag is 300 euros.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.333
Our tracker stopped moving.

29:18.416 --> 29:19.625
Where?

29:19.708 --> 29:21.416
Somewhere near Calle de Echegaray.

29:21.500 --> 29:23.291
Can you get an exact location?

29:23.375 --> 29:26.291
It looks like it's some nightclub.

29:26.375 --> 29:27.958
-The Inferno?
-Who owns it?

29:28.041 --> 29:30.666
Says it's owned
and operated by a Felipe Calero.

29:30.750 --> 29:32.458
Multiple articles say the Calero family

29:32.541 --> 29:34.750
is pretty deep
into real estate around Madrid.

29:34.833 --> 29:39.125
Flats, business complexes,
obviously clubs. The whole nine.

29:39.958 --> 29:43.583
Everything I'm finding
on this Felipe Calero is squeaky clean.

29:45.625 --> 29:48.250
He's a family man, philanthropist.

29:50.083 --> 29:53.000
He might not have any idea
what's going on inside his club.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.750
Maybe. But we should
definitely kick the tires on him and see.

30:02.625 --> 30:04.125
It's my daughter. I gotta go.

30:05.083 --> 30:05.916
Okay.

30:06.833 --> 30:09.125
Let's call it a night.
We'll regroup tomorrow.

30:10.166 --> 30:11.416
I'm taking this.

30:11.500 --> 30:14.041
Jenny, get some rest.
We need you at full strength.

30:22.208 --> 30:25.166
-You're playing with fire, man.
-The less Jenny knows the better.

30:25.750 --> 30:26.958
The better for who? You?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.375
I know what I'm doing.

30:29.458 --> 30:33.583
The last time you said that,
that's how we ended up here.

30:38.000 --> 30:38.875
Hey.

30:39.750 --> 30:42.708
-What's going on?
-I'm switching rooms.

30:42.791 --> 30:44.291
Check you out with the tablet.

30:44.375 --> 30:46.125
I borrowed it from one of the moms.

30:46.208 --> 30:48.083
What do you mean "switching rooms"?

30:48.166 --> 30:50.708
I know you said
you needed some space on this trip, but--

30:50.791 --> 30:52.833
Mom. You're really being
super dramatic right now.

30:52.916 --> 30:54.708
No. I'm just trying to understand.

30:54.791 --> 30:58.208
Maddie and the team asked me if I could
come stay in her room with them.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.791
-Maddie said that?
-Yeah.

31:00.875 --> 31:02.083
Seriously?

31:02.166 --> 31:04.166
Yeah. I'm not even joking.

31:04.875 --> 31:06.375
Mom, stop. Ew.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.375
-Can I leave my meds here?
-Becca, no.

31:10.458 --> 31:14.000
I've been feeling less anxious
and I think that if I could just have--

31:14.083 --> 31:16.083
-I don't know.
-Okay, fine.

31:16.166 --> 31:18.000
I'll come by every morning and take them.

31:18.083 --> 31:21.125
I just don't wanna be
the girl on the team who takes her meds.

31:22.791 --> 31:24.458
Okay. I guess.

31:25.291 --> 31:26.166
Thank you.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.625
You're gonna be good, right?

31:29.708 --> 31:30.833
Me? Yeah.

31:32.541 --> 31:33.791
I'm just two floors down.

31:33.875 --> 31:35.333
It's gonna be great.

31:36.250 --> 31:39.416
Okay. I gotta go.
We're all hanging out by the pool.

31:39.500 --> 31:40.791
Do your leave-in tonight.

31:40.875 --> 31:42.833
You know how your hair gets
when you go swimming.

31:42.916 --> 31:46.541
Oh. No offense, but don't call me.

31:46.625 --> 31:47.541
I'll text you.

31:48.125 --> 31:50.333
All right. Love you, baby.

31:52.291 --> 31:54.708
Somebody really loves himself.

32:02.916 --> 32:03.750
<i>All good?</i>

32:03.833 --> 32:05.416
I know this guy.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.708
<i>You know Felipe Calero?</i>

32:07.791 --> 32:09.625
No, I don't know him personally,

32:10.458 --> 32:12.333
but I know guys like him.

32:12.416 --> 32:13.416
They're a type.

32:14.333 --> 32:18.208
Narcissistic, arrogant, scared.

32:19.583 --> 32:22.166
This guy's got a serious savior complex.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.416
<i>You've been doing a lot of reading.</i>

32:24.500 --> 32:26.791
I know the kind of woman he wants.

32:28.541 --> 32:31.583
And since my daughter
is not coming back to her room tonight,

32:32.958 --> 32:35.416
I say we pay Jesus Christ a visit

32:35.500 --> 32:39.541
and see if any of that Puoco Franco money
lands on his offering plate.

32:39.625 --> 32:43.000
<i>I don't think it's a good idea</i>
<i>for you to morph again this soon.</i>

32:45.166 --> 32:46.041
Me neither.

32:47.666 --> 32:48.958
Luckily I won't have to.

33:05.875 --> 33:06.875
You look nice.

33:07.625 --> 33:08.625
Can I say that?

33:08.708 --> 33:11.291
I mean, technically
this is a workplace environment.

33:12.208 --> 33:14.333
You don't have to worry
about that with me.

33:14.416 --> 33:16.250
If you say something I don't like

33:16.333 --> 33:17.666
I'll just break your nose.

33:18.708 --> 33:19.750
Fair enough.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.000
<i>Hola.</i>

33:27.083 --> 33:28.541
<i>-Gracias.</i>
-<i>De nada.</i>

33:41.041 --> 33:43.375
<i>Let me tell y'all</i>
<i>how it works up in this joint.</i>

33:43.458 --> 33:47.041
<i>Each level represents a different</i>
<i>circle of hell with its own unique vibe.</i>

33:47.125 --> 33:49.583
<i>You guys are on level one, Limbo.</i>

33:49.666 --> 33:53.875
<i>So people start there and they work</i>
<i>their way down to level nine, Treachery.</i>

33:53.958 --> 33:55.500
Dante's <i>Inferno.</i>

33:56.666 --> 33:57.708
Very European.

34:01.125 --> 34:04.083
All righty. I think our tracker
should be down on level two.

34:07.250 --> 34:08.291
Lust.

34:08.375 --> 34:12.500
Specifically, in this area
they like to call the <i>"Sala de Caricias."</i>

34:13.125 --> 34:15.000
The "Touching Room."

34:15.666 --> 34:16.708
Okay.

34:17.541 --> 34:20.291
-We're heading down.
-Mm-mm-mm.

34:34.291 --> 34:35.583
<i>Guys, from what I can see,</i>

34:35.666 --> 34:37.750
<i>y'all should be practically</i>
<i>on top of the tracker.</i>

34:37.833 --> 34:40.041
It's gonna be
in that room behind the guard.

34:44.875 --> 34:49.708
But he's got cameras everywhere
because he likes to watch.

34:50.708 --> 34:53.541
All right. How the hell
are we meant to get in there?

34:53.625 --> 34:55.166
He's gonna let us in.

34:55.875 --> 34:57.250
Who? Felipe?

35:09.958 --> 35:12.291
Get your damn hands off of me!

35:12.375 --> 35:13.541
Please, help me.

35:13.625 --> 35:16.875
-What the fuck are you--
-He touched me without my consent.

35:18.416 --> 35:20.000
Hey, guys, come on! She wanted it!

35:20.083 --> 35:21.583
-Look at her!
-Can you believe that?

35:21.666 --> 35:24.416
Let me go,
you fuckin' asshole. Come on!

35:24.500 --> 35:27.416
Are you okay? Are you okay?

35:28.791 --> 35:30.625
Please allow me
to introduce myself.

35:31.333 --> 35:33.250
My name is Felipe Calero.

35:33.333 --> 35:36.083
Owner of Inferno.

35:36.666 --> 35:37.708
My name is Sara.

35:37.791 --> 35:40.500
I should like
to apologize to you personally.

35:40.583 --> 35:42.250
On behalf of my club

35:43.208 --> 35:44.500
and gentlemen everywhere.

35:47.791 --> 35:48.750
<i>Gracias.</i>

35:48.833 --> 35:52.291
I'm responsible for everything
that happens in this establishment.

35:53.041 --> 35:54.833
You can't control riffraff.

35:55.791 --> 35:56.750
That's true.

35:59.250 --> 36:01.458
I should get going.
It's way past my bedtime.

36:01.541 --> 36:03.041
No, please don't leave.

36:03.125 --> 36:05.875
It's early.
Have a drink. With me.

36:07.625 --> 36:09.458
I shouldn't.

36:09.541 --> 36:11.791
As my personal guest.

36:14.458 --> 36:18.041
You make it hard to, um, say no.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.333
Then say yes.

36:21.000 --> 36:21.833
Huh?

36:26.166 --> 36:28.875
Join me.
Let's go to level three.

36:46.750 --> 36:49.125
This is really a beautiful space.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.166
<i>Gracias.</i>

36:50.250 --> 36:53.291
My family and I
like to entertain special guests here.

36:53.375 --> 36:54.916
You and your family close?

36:55.000 --> 36:55.833
<i>Sí.</i>

36:55.916 --> 36:57.875
Everything you see is from my family.

36:57.958 --> 37:00.875
From my brother,
from my sister, from my nephews.

37:00.958 --> 37:03.083
We are all a part of it.

37:04.458 --> 37:06.916
But enough about me.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.833
Tell me about yourself.

37:08.916 --> 37:12.500
Who are you?
Where are you from? Everything.

37:12.583 --> 37:13.541
<i>Bien.</i>

37:13.625 --> 37:16.750
-My name is Sara Fonte.
-Sara Fonte from where?

37:17.333 --> 37:18.958
I was born in Alicante.

37:20.041 --> 37:24.041
But my father is from the United States
so, uh, I grew up in New York City.

37:24.125 --> 37:27.208
Alicante and New York.
I know both cities very well.

37:27.291 --> 37:30.666
-You do?
-Yes. My work takes me all over.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.916
And what brings you to Madrid?

37:35.875 --> 37:37.166
Well, um…

37:38.083 --> 37:40.541
My husband was from Madrid.

37:40.625 --> 37:45.166
We had planned this trip over a year ago
for our tenth year anniversary.

37:48.625 --> 37:50.250
But he died six months ago.

37:53.250 --> 37:54.458
<i>Lo siento.</i>

37:56.500 --> 37:59.750
I decided to come anyway.
I thought he would want me to.

38:00.875 --> 38:04.250
I even started taking
this palm-reading class.

38:04.333 --> 38:06.125
-Palm-reading class?
<i>-Sí.</i>

38:06.208 --> 38:09.000
I think it's fascinating.
I've always wanted to learn.

38:11.625 --> 38:12.458
<i>Aquí.</i>

38:14.958 --> 38:16.583
Let me see your left hand.

38:21.541 --> 38:22.375
Hmm.

38:25.208 --> 38:26.708
Anything interesting?

38:26.791 --> 38:30.291
Mm, your palm is round and long.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.666
And what does that mean?

38:33.750 --> 38:39.250
It means you're probably
artistic and philosophical.

38:40.125 --> 38:41.333
<i>Aquí.</i>

38:41.416 --> 38:43.250
-You see this line here?
-Yeah.

38:43.333 --> 38:45.250
Between your middle and first fingers?

38:46.208 --> 38:47.750
It means you're very spoiled.

38:49.541 --> 38:51.000
Spoiled?

38:51.083 --> 38:53.208
You had a lot of attention
growing up.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.875
Probably still do.

39:02.625 --> 39:04.375
I apologize for the intrusion, Felipe.

39:05.166 --> 39:06.625
We have a problem.

39:06.708 --> 39:08.916
Sara, this is my brother, Andrés.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.458
Sara is from Alicante.

39:10.541 --> 39:12.333
Well, by way of New York.

39:12.416 --> 39:16.458
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-The pleasure is all mine, Sara. Shall we?

39:20.041 --> 39:21.916
Sara, I hate to do this.

39:23.208 --> 39:24.458
Business calls.

39:24.541 --> 39:25.916
Please stay.

39:26.958 --> 39:28.000
I won't be long.

39:28.958 --> 39:30.833
And I'd like to continue my reading.

39:33.416 --> 39:36.916
In the meantime,
my barman will take care of you.

39:39.416 --> 39:40.375
<i>Gracias.</i>

39:43.208 --> 39:44.250
Fuck. Let's go.

40:37.291 --> 40:39.041
<i>Jenny, your signal is weak.</i>

40:40.083 --> 40:41.791
I'm not sure where I am.

40:43.083 --> 40:45.750
It's like an adjoining level of rooms.

41:09.958 --> 41:11.458
Lidia.

41:11.541 --> 41:13.000
<i>I've found Lidia. She's alive.</i>

41:13.083 --> 41:17.000
That's good, Jenny, but listen to me,
you cannot blow your cover.

41:17.083 --> 41:19.750
No!

41:19.833 --> 41:21.083
<i>Lidia, just hold on.</i>

41:21.166 --> 41:23.541
-Who's there?
-Someone's coming.

41:27.708 --> 41:28.750
No, no, please, please.

41:55.500 --> 41:57.125
She knows nothing.

42:00.083 --> 42:01.666
Maybe there is nothing to know.

42:04.375 --> 42:06.250
There was a woman at the prison.

42:08.958 --> 42:10.083
After that…

42:10.916 --> 42:12.916
Yannick's phone goes missing.

42:15.083 --> 42:18.041
When we find this one, there is a woman,

42:19.458 --> 42:20.833
maybe the same woman,

42:22.041 --> 42:23.041
talking to her.

42:24.458 --> 42:25.583
Do not worry.

42:25.666 --> 42:27.000
I will handle it.

42:37.083 --> 42:39.500
Please. Don't hurt me.

42:39.583 --> 42:42.416
-I told you I don't know anything.

42:46.291 --> 42:50.833
Who was that woman
who was with you at the graveyard?

42:50.916 --> 42:51.833
I don't know.

42:52.708 --> 42:56.250
<i>I don't know. I swear.</i>
<i>She just showed up. I was trying just to…</i>

42:57.750 --> 42:59.041
I just was…

43:00.083 --> 43:02.291
Ramón,
please what's going on?

43:02.375 --> 43:05.625
Please, what's going on? Please help.

43:09.166 --> 43:10.666
You know this girl?

43:11.416 --> 43:15.125
I knew her fiancé.
He bought Puoco Franco from me.

43:16.166 --> 43:17.083
That's all.

43:18.458 --> 43:19.625
Is this true?

43:20.416 --> 43:22.250
<i>Sí, sí, sí, sí.</i>

43:23.875 --> 43:25.041
Come beside me.

43:27.166 --> 43:31.791
Please, my love.

43:33.666 --> 43:34.583
Uncle.

43:34.666 --> 43:36.041
I'm telling the truth.

43:36.125 --> 43:37.000
Then…

43:38.000 --> 43:40.625
Then you will have
no problem fighting her.

43:42.708 --> 43:44.166
<i>You want me to fight a girl?</i>

43:46.916 --> 43:47.875
<i>Sí.</i>

43:54.916 --> 43:58.333
You know what
I most enjoy about bullfighting?

44:00.625 --> 44:03.375
During the first stage of a bullfight,

44:03.458 --> 44:07.916
two picadors
enter the arena carrying lances.

44:08.000 --> 44:12.083
And the bull is encouraged
to attack one of these horses.

44:13.208 --> 44:15.291
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

44:17.083 --> 44:18.166
Please.

44:18.250 --> 44:19.458
He's being tricked.

44:21.416 --> 44:23.541
The bull is being lured to his death

44:23.625 --> 44:28.375
because he does not know
that his true enemy is not the horse,

44:28.458 --> 44:30.083
but the picador.

44:31.125 --> 44:35.666
Who will stab him in the neck
as soon as he is close enough.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.916
If the bull wants his freedom,

44:42.833 --> 44:43.875
he has to earn it.

44:45.958 --> 44:49.000
And there is no such thing
as a fair fight.

44:49.083 --> 44:52.625
One animal
is always more desperate than the other.

44:53.750 --> 44:56.125
So, you must ask yourselves,

44:56.708 --> 44:58.125
"Are you a bullfighter?"

45:01.416 --> 45:02.500
"Or a bull?"

45:06.458 --> 45:08.000
Let's get her on her feet.

45:08.083 --> 45:08.916
Please.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.708
Carmo, easy there. Relax.

45:11.458 --> 45:12.708
Hold your horses.

45:12.791 --> 45:14.458
Please.

45:14.541 --> 45:15.541
Let me do this.

45:15.625 --> 45:19.541
Please. Please. Please.

45:21.041 --> 45:23.208
Don't embarrass me nephew.

45:26.916 --> 45:28.208
<i>Por favor.</i>

45:28.291 --> 45:29.833
Let's see what you got.

45:29.916 --> 45:30.958
<i>Por favor.</i>

45:35.833 --> 45:37.916
Please, I beg you.

45:38.750 --> 45:42.291
Please, please, I beg you.

45:42.375 --> 45:43.666
Please, no.

45:50.875 --> 45:51.750
Please.

45:57.125 --> 45:58.875
Man, this is hard to watch.

46:01.125 --> 46:02.541
Uncle.

46:02.625 --> 46:03.541
Please.

46:33.041 --> 46:34.083
Enough.

46:35.333 --> 46:37.125
Get up. Both of you.

46:41.583 --> 46:43.333
You. Come here.

46:47.583 --> 46:48.583
Los Jinetes.

46:49.708 --> 46:52.208
Our champion. Applaud her.

47:00.875 --> 47:01.791
You.

47:02.875 --> 47:04.541
You are indeed a warrior.

47:11.791 --> 47:14.833
<i>Jenny,</i>
<i>you can't blow your cover.</i>

47:17.875 --> 47:18.875
No, Uncle--

47:26.041 --> 47:28.333
Los Jinetes,
what do you see here?

47:34.000 --> 47:35.375
I see a traitor.

47:37.916 --> 47:40.041
He conspired with our enemies.

47:40.125 --> 47:43.083
Those who want
to steal our country from us

47:43.166 --> 47:46.916
by letting the immigrants
come in and take everything.

47:48.833 --> 47:49.916
My nephew…

47:52.708 --> 47:58.916
he was helping by telling them about
our plans to execute the prime minister.

47:59.958 --> 48:03.541
Because of this traitor,
we have to start over.

48:05.291 --> 48:06.375
And so we will.

48:07.875 --> 48:08.750
Remember this,

48:09.750 --> 48:11.916
the authorities will do
what they have to do.

48:12.958 --> 48:14.208
We must also.

48:16.750 --> 48:18.708
You have one loyalty

48:18.791 --> 48:20.166
and that is to Los Jinetes!

48:20.250 --> 48:21.083
<i>-Sí!</i>
-Yes!

48:21.166 --> 48:22.666
To your people!

48:22.750 --> 48:24.333
Long live Spain!

48:24.416 --> 48:26.583
-Long live Spain!
-Long live!

48:31.208 --> 48:32.791
We must find this woman.

48:33.791 --> 48:35.250
I will take care of that.

48:36.625 --> 48:39.833
And I will let Gideon know
how you handled your business today.

48:41.208 --> 48:42.500
With power.

48:48.833 --> 48:49.958
Come here.

48:50.041 --> 48:51.125
Come here!

48:54.458 --> 48:56.458
Without tears. Hmm?

48:58.166 --> 48:59.166
You're a man.

49:01.208 --> 49:02.333
Dispose of the bodies.

49:03.416 --> 49:04.750
You burn them.

49:04.833 --> 49:06.583
You hear me?
Are you listening?

49:07.541 --> 49:10.958
And your mother
should never hear

49:11.041 --> 49:13.458
about this embarrassment to our family.

49:18.666 --> 49:19.833
Clean up this mess.

49:21.250 --> 49:22.208
So do it.

49:29.208 --> 49:31.500
You've heard him, gentlemen.
Let's get to work.

49:41.083 --> 49:42.291
<i>Her vitals are spiking.</i>

49:43.583 --> 49:45.583
<i>Jenny, you need to keep it together.</i>
