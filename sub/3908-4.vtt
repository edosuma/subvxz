00:00.002 --> 00:01.627
_

00:01.662 --> 00:03.307
You're not answering
my phone calls.

00:03.342 --> 00:05.190
Steve, look...
this has run its course.

00:05.225 --> 00:06.957
You and I--
There's just not much there.

00:07.186 --> 00:09.745
- You fucking started this.
- Don't push this somewhere ugly.

00:10.281 --> 00:11.475
Go.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.222
Don't come back.

00:13.622 --> 00:14.394
It's on you.

00:14.791 --> 00:17.562
Are you related to Elliot
Bezzerides by any chance?

00:17.597 --> 00:18.909
I left all that behind.

00:19.695 --> 00:21.400
The mayor is very upset.

00:21.435 --> 00:24.483
This comes into my house,
no warrant, no nothing.

00:24.575 --> 00:25.848
I want her badge.

00:26.091 --> 00:27.747
I keep thinking about the village.

00:27.782 --> 00:29.539
We ain't soldiers anymore, man.

00:29.574 --> 00:31.301
- I think about you, man.
- Stop it.

00:31.336 --> 00:33.611
Look, don't pretend, all right?
Don't pre--

00:35.643 --> 00:37.954
Caspere had a lot of
my money in play. Real estate.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.200
This wasn't everything.

00:39.282 --> 00:41.086
Who has something to gain
by trying to fuck with me?

00:41.159 --> 00:43.759
Frankie, you ain't
that thing no more--

00:43.826 --> 00:45.233
what you used to was.

00:57.863 --> 00:59.450
That was fucking him!

I paid for fucking
avocado trees

02:56.369 --> 02:57.786
and now you tell me can't grow?

02:57.820 --> 02:59.571
Man can come, test the dirt.

02:59.573 --> 03:01.956
I thought one of you'd
be able to taste it

03:01.991 --> 03:03.875
off your finger
and tell me what's wrong.

03:03.909 --> 03:06.244
Frank, that's enough.

03:10.499 --> 03:11.633
Like it fucking matters.

03:11.667 --> 03:13.134
Can't deal with this shit now.

03:13.169 --> 03:15.086
We should talk

03:15.137 --> 03:18.923
if we want to reschedule
that doctor's appointment.

03:18.974 --> 03:21.760
We'll get back on the kid
when I get my feet under me.

03:26.015 --> 03:28.349
Maybe we've been
going about it wrong.

03:29.435 --> 03:32.153
How's that, specifically?

03:32.188 --> 03:34.022
Right now there's
so many things for me

03:34.073 --> 03:36.741
to go about the wrong way,
I'm losing my fucking vision.

03:47.787 --> 03:49.954
The baby.

03:51.090 --> 03:53.541
Maybe we should talk
alternatives.

03:53.592 --> 03:55.760
Like what, another dog?

03:56.846 --> 03:58.463
Adoption.

03:58.514 --> 04:02.183
No, you don't do
somebody else's time.

04:02.218 --> 04:06.221
My own kid, I see.
Yeah, it's my responsibility.

04:06.272 --> 04:10.191
But you don't take on
somebody else's grief.

04:10.226 --> 04:13.027
A child's not grief.

04:13.062 --> 04:15.113
I mean they all
come in with their own.

04:15.147 --> 04:18.899
Don't you and I and every other
hapless monkey on the planet?

04:18.951 --> 04:21.286
At least with your kid,
it's your sins.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.538
What if I can't have a child?

04:23.572 --> 04:26.574
Why wouldn't you? You got
pregnant before, you said.

04:26.625 --> 04:28.576
Maybe that's--

04:30.329 --> 04:32.330
the operation, it...

04:36.085 --> 04:38.136
might have made things hard.

04:39.004 --> 04:40.805
I don't know.

04:42.424 --> 04:44.893
You can have a kid.
Look at you.

04:44.927 --> 04:47.812
But if.
I'm saying if.

04:50.566 --> 04:52.684
You should get more tests.

04:52.735 --> 04:54.752
Whatever they got.

04:57.022 --> 04:59.124
I gotta go to work.

05:00.659 --> 05:02.327
If I don't come up
with a new play,

05:02.361 --> 05:05.446
the dead trees,
the present from the stork

05:05.531 --> 05:07.665
are gonna be what they
call moot points.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.118
All right, Frank.

05:10.169 --> 05:11.753
Go to work.

05:18.277 --> 05:20.712
<i>( dog barking )</i>

05:26.435 --> 05:28.803
( groans )

05:39.982 --> 05:42.650
<i>( TV playing )</i>

05:49.124 --> 05:50.875
( in Spanish )
<i>Hello, motherfucker.</i>

05:50.910 --> 05:53.461
<i>We put out some fires</i>
<i>last night or what?</i>

05:56.632 --> 05:59.467
I, uh--

05:59.501 --> 06:00.885
I drove here?

06:00.920 --> 06:03.304
You don't remember
meeting me at Lux?

06:03.339 --> 06:05.256
No.

06:10.980 --> 06:13.431
I'm glad you did, man.

06:13.482 --> 06:15.433
DVR'd the game.

06:15.517 --> 06:17.652
Here, sit down.
Have some waffles.

06:17.686 --> 06:19.821
I got work.

06:22.274 --> 06:24.158
<i>You let yourself go, man.</i>

06:24.193 --> 06:26.160
Be what you want.
It ain't bad.

06:28.614 --> 06:30.265
Need a ride to your bike?

06:30.299 --> 06:32.116
No.

06:59.979 --> 07:02.146
( groans )

07:02.148 --> 07:03.698
No.

07:05.367 --> 07:07.785
Fuck. Fuck.
Fuck.

07:07.820 --> 07:10.121
Come on.
No.

07:10.155 --> 07:12.373
Fuck.

07:14.076 --> 07:17.211
( groans )
Fuck.

07:17.246 --> 07:19.881
Fuck.

07:19.915 --> 07:21.549
Fuck.

07:21.583 --> 07:23.051
Fuck!

07:23.085 --> 07:26.421
( chattering )

07:28.674 --> 07:30.475
Officer Woodrugh!

07:30.509 --> 07:32.343
What's your comment on the
war crimes allegation?

07:32.345 --> 07:34.746
Were you involved with the securing
of a village outside Habbaniyah?

07:34.780 --> 07:37.315
Would you say your behavior with
Lacey Lindel follows a pattern

07:37.349 --> 07:38.733
given the accusations against
Black Mountain operatives?

07:38.767 --> 07:40.685
Do you have a history
of abuse with women?

07:40.719 --> 07:44.355
Say, about 5'10", maybe 160?

07:44.390 --> 07:48.026
- What do you think?
- I think we fucked up.

07:48.028 --> 07:50.361
So it wasn't the transpo guy.

07:50.412 --> 07:53.448
No, it was somebody who wanted
us to think it might be

07:53.499 --> 07:55.583
dumping the car near his place.

07:55.617 --> 07:59.754
Listen, that thing
at the mayor's house...

07:59.788 --> 08:02.423
I respect the sack,
but it's--

08:02.458 --> 08:04.092
it's looking
to come back on you.

08:04.126 --> 08:08.513
Ooh, the mayor of the Shitberg
Landfill is gonna get me?

08:08.547 --> 08:10.848
His family's controlled
this landfill for 100 years.

08:10.883 --> 08:13.434
And he lives in the biggest
house on his street in Bel-Air.

08:13.469 --> 08:17.422
You think men like that exist without
a long history of high-up friends?

08:17.456 --> 08:19.474
I don't think he's gonna
have too many friends,

08:19.525 --> 08:21.559
the state investigation
shakes out.

08:21.610 --> 08:22.944
Unless it's his cellmate.

08:22.978 --> 08:24.979
That's what I'm telling
you, Bezzerides.

08:25.030 --> 08:28.533
State investigation, you don't think
they've seen that before down here?

08:28.567 --> 08:30.785
Any member of that family
ever gone to jail?

08:31.987 --> 08:33.788
Look...

08:35.908 --> 08:39.159
Detective, the state
investigation's a shakedown.

08:39.211 --> 08:40.878
Do you understand?

08:40.913 --> 08:43.297
It's the attorney general
with his fucking hand out.

08:43.332 --> 08:44.999
Hand out for what?

08:45.050 --> 08:47.251
What's a hand usually out for?

08:47.302 --> 08:49.504
Caspere was in a lot
of development money.

08:49.555 --> 08:53.257
These land deals floating
around, those new corporations?

08:53.308 --> 08:54.809
You think this is
about stopping Vinci

08:54.843 --> 08:57.478
doing the same thing it's
been doing for a century?

08:57.513 --> 08:59.313
Nobody wants to stop it.

08:59.348 --> 09:01.682
Nobody gives a shit.

09:03.102 --> 09:05.186
I'm here to solve a murder.

09:05.237 --> 09:07.939
And when our betters make nice
and the money's traded hands

09:07.941 --> 09:10.992
and they need something to show
for this big investigation,

09:11.026 --> 09:14.278
who do you think's gonna be
first in the firing line?

09:14.329 --> 09:16.447
I'm gonna take a wild guess
that you and Woodrugh

09:16.449 --> 09:19.050
ain't the most popular
folks at your squads.

09:19.084 --> 09:21.002
Expendable, one might say.

09:21.036 --> 09:24.288
Well, you're not dirty, they
shouldn't be able to hurt you.

09:24.290 --> 09:27.175
Well, I don't know about Ventura, but
you can't be that naive down here.

09:27.209 --> 09:28.676
If there's a buyout
with the state attorney,

09:28.710 --> 09:30.762
Chessani could make
your ass part of the deal.

09:32.548 --> 09:34.849
Where's Woodrugh?

09:34.883 --> 09:36.934
He was working
prosts last night.

09:36.969 --> 09:40.054
- <i> ( phone buzzing )</i>
- I hope he didn't fall in.

09:47.062 --> 09:48.563
Velcoro.

09:49.698 --> 09:51.666
Ani:
<i>That a barroom sunburn?</i>

09:51.700 --> 09:55.203
Maybe I've just been out in the sun
working bullshit pawn details.

09:56.989 --> 09:59.991
You know what?
I could give a shit.

10:00.042 --> 10:03.161
I don't think there's any
confusion about that, Detective.

10:06.565 --> 10:09.600
Armin: <i>Frank, what you ask,
you would need to be family</i>

10:09.635 --> 10:11.769
just to avoid insult.

10:11.804 --> 10:13.554
Family is blood.

10:13.589 --> 10:15.590
Blood spilled is blood.

10:15.641 --> 10:19.477
'99. '03.

10:19.511 --> 10:21.729
January 2010.

10:21.763 --> 10:24.899
I've done you favors.

10:24.933 --> 10:27.685
What you mention--
history.

10:27.736 --> 10:29.604
We paid for that.

10:29.655 --> 10:31.689
You paid Osip back

10:31.740 --> 10:34.025
when he was around to be paid.

10:34.076 --> 10:35.693
Me?

10:37.329 --> 10:38.863
I just call it a favor.

10:38.865 --> 10:42.450
And you think what, an old favor
gets you free merchandise?

10:42.501 --> 10:44.202
I don't want a handout.

10:44.204 --> 10:45.786
I wouldn't take it.

10:45.838 --> 10:47.371
I'm talking consignment.

10:47.422 --> 10:49.106
I've got the Lux back.

10:49.141 --> 10:51.209
I need product
to move through it.

10:51.211 --> 10:53.678
Notice I'm not talking
to the Mexicans

10:53.712 --> 10:55.296
or Russians.

10:55.347 --> 10:57.548
I'm talking to you.

10:57.599 --> 11:00.101
I'm offering 5%
above your going rate.

11:00.135 --> 11:02.720
I need coke, crystal,

11:02.771 --> 11:06.140
and whatever the fuck
they call MDMA now.

11:06.191 --> 11:09.560
We move it through the club,
you get paid plus five.

11:09.562 --> 11:11.279
It's a risk, Frank.

11:11.313 --> 11:13.781
For me, not for you.

11:13.815 --> 11:15.566
Our men handle sales.

11:15.617 --> 11:19.403
No, I run the club.

11:19.405 --> 11:21.489
I control who moves
what and when

11:21.540 --> 11:23.241
and they answer to me.

11:23.243 --> 11:25.459
Your only concern
is your money.

11:25.494 --> 11:27.879
Santos had his own arrangement.

11:27.913 --> 11:29.213
Mexicans.

11:29.248 --> 11:30.882
I'll deal with it.

11:30.916 --> 11:33.718
Armin: <i> And how have you dealt with
things since you've been away, huh?</i>

11:33.752 --> 11:35.753
<i>Why you back to this, Frank?</i>

11:35.804 --> 11:39.590
<i>I think it's because your other
plan, it somehow failed.</i>

11:39.641 --> 11:42.510
Why now would we trust you
not to fail in this, huh?

11:42.561 --> 11:44.979
It's respectable,
what I'm offering.

11:45.013 --> 11:49.217
I'll upscale your clientele,
increase your market.

11:49.251 --> 11:51.152
And together we'll prosper.

11:52.354 --> 11:54.655
We don't do consignment, Frank.

11:57.159 --> 12:01.779
5% is not
a one-time number.

12:01.781 --> 12:03.664
It's monthly.

12:03.699 --> 12:06.584
Month in, month out.

12:06.618 --> 12:08.753
It is a long-term
investment

12:08.787 --> 12:11.172
in a mutually beneficial
relationship.

12:22.267 --> 12:24.302
Then we're settled at five.

12:26.138 --> 12:28.356
All that sugar, Frank,

12:28.390 --> 12:30.708
I wonder you haven't
lost your teeth.

12:32.611 --> 12:35.479
Dental work's expensive.

12:35.481 --> 12:38.816
It's the only way I can
keep your coffee down.

12:46.575 --> 12:48.909
I never lost a tooth.

12:48.961 --> 12:51.746
Never even had
a fucking cavity.

13:21.526 --> 13:24.245
( horns honking )

13:25.364 --> 13:27.331
Glove box.

13:27.366 --> 13:29.400
Take a cure.

13:39.711 --> 13:42.096
Where's your bike?

13:42.130 --> 13:44.965
Stolen.

13:45.017 --> 13:47.218
I checked city impound already.

13:49.638 --> 13:51.305
That hotel have a shower?

13:51.356 --> 13:54.525
I couldn't get back in.

13:55.444 --> 13:58.529
Reporters mobbed me.

13:58.563 --> 14:00.398
Cameras and shit.

14:03.068 --> 14:07.988
( sighs )
My picture's gonna be everywhere, man.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.041
Fuck 'em.

14:10.075 --> 14:12.410
They lie without blinking.

14:12.412 --> 14:14.912
You know what one of those
dog fuckers said to me once?

14:14.914 --> 14:17.915
I'd rather be wrong and first
than right and second.

14:19.301 --> 14:21.252
That tells you
all you need to know.

14:23.472 --> 14:25.756
<i>I read about that actress.</i>

14:25.807 --> 14:27.425
The Black Mountain stuff.

14:27.427 --> 14:30.428
Fallujah, Tikrit.
You've seen shit.

14:30.479 --> 14:32.763
After that, anything else
should be a cakewalk.

14:32.814 --> 14:34.732
( exhales )

14:34.766 --> 14:36.517
It's actually
just the opposite.

14:36.568 --> 14:39.019
Well, you're a war hero
is my outlook.

14:39.071 --> 14:42.022
You had a bad night and they
don't need to hear about it.

14:49.865 --> 14:53.250
I did everything
they said, man.

14:53.285 --> 14:56.537
Army, PD.

14:59.257 --> 15:01.125
But it doesn't matter.

15:02.511 --> 15:05.129
You do what they say,
it doesn't matter.

15:06.465 --> 15:08.549
Ahem.

15:13.188 --> 15:15.973
Oh, fuck.

15:15.975 --> 15:20.194
Been listening to them
for so fucking long that...

15:20.228 --> 15:22.146
I don't even know
who the fuck I am.

15:22.148 --> 15:24.865
You're a survivor.

15:24.900 --> 15:26.650
Everything else
just dust in your eyes.

15:26.652 --> 15:28.619
Blink it away, man.

15:30.489 --> 15:32.490
I don't know.

15:32.541 --> 15:34.325
<i>I'll get your stuff.</i>

15:34.376 --> 15:37.962
Take it to another hotel,
all right?

15:40.048 --> 15:43.501
I just don't know how to be...

15:43.503 --> 15:45.169
out in the world, man.

15:45.171 --> 15:48.255
Hey, look out that window.

15:48.306 --> 15:50.307
Look at me.

15:50.342 --> 15:51.809
Nobody does.

15:51.843 --> 15:53.561
<i>Hit that again.</i>

15:53.595 --> 15:56.230
<i>We'll get you some Pedialyte.</i>

15:59.351 --> 16:03.070
All right,
enough of this monkey fuck.

16:03.104 --> 16:05.239
( siren chirping )

16:22.123 --> 16:24.842
- ( chatter )
- <i> ( dog barking )</i>

16:33.885 --> 16:35.719
Frank:
<i>Place runs strong, huh?</i>

16:35.770 --> 16:37.104
<i>How many beaners you got here?</i>

16:37.138 --> 16:40.591
Luca: <i>It's like, I
think, 200 or so.</i>

16:40.625 --> 16:43.494
You need some help
managing this place, Luke.

16:43.528 --> 16:45.329
My view.

16:45.363 --> 16:48.148
You need security, collections.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.901
Collections.

16:50.903 --> 16:55.172
Frank, you sold the place,
you got the cash.

16:55.207 --> 16:57.374
Oh, sure.

16:58.376 --> 17:00.327
You own it, no question.

17:00.378 --> 17:01.795
No question.

17:01.830 --> 17:05.532
I'm thinking partnership.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.218
30%.

17:08.319 --> 17:13.007
I'm thinking
the next three months,

17:13.040 --> 17:16.894
we start pulling in
what this place should.

17:16.928 --> 17:18.262
You'll do better.

17:18.313 --> 17:20.347
( stuttering )
This ain't right, Frank.

17:20.397 --> 17:22.098
I'm already paying Chessani.

17:22.101 --> 17:23.934
Place has expenses.

17:25.604 --> 17:27.521
Nobody wants to feel
taken advantage of.

17:27.571 --> 17:29.657
I ain't, man.
You set the price.

17:29.691 --> 17:31.408
So long as it's cash, you said.

17:38.533 --> 17:40.284
40%.

17:40.286 --> 17:43.621
We're gonna handle
the collections from now on.

17:43.623 --> 17:46.040
We'll be knocking
first of the month.

17:48.293 --> 17:50.377
And mow the fucking lawn.

17:50.428 --> 17:52.963
I don't want any of these
kids getting snakebit.

18:03.275 --> 18:06.277
Ray: <i>You want to give him new
reasons to step on you, huh?</i>

18:14.502 --> 18:16.654
Ani:
<i>That's the daughter.</i>

18:20.575 --> 18:22.626
( engine starts )

18:28.500 --> 18:32.136
Ani: Did you know Ben
Caspere, the city manager?

18:35.974 --> 18:37.391
I knew him a little.

18:37.425 --> 18:39.093
<i>He was nice to me.</i>

18:39.144 --> 18:41.095
He know your brother very well?

18:41.146 --> 18:43.147
<i>I don't think so.</i>

18:43.181 --> 18:46.967
Tony wouldn't have much
in common with Mr. Caspere.

18:49.020 --> 18:53.240
Mr. Caspere was talking to someone
on your second phone line a lot.

18:54.409 --> 18:56.193
Think that was
your dad or Tony?

18:58.463 --> 19:00.130
I don't know.

19:00.165 --> 19:02.066
How would I know?

19:02.100 --> 19:05.536
There's no rules, you see?

19:05.538 --> 19:07.538
It's how it's always been.

19:15.130 --> 19:19.133
Your father's wife,
she's not your mom.

19:23.438 --> 19:26.056
My mom died in a
hospital in Nevada.

19:29.894 --> 19:33.280
When I was 11, she started
manifesting schizophrenia.

19:34.315 --> 19:35.866
She became dangerous.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.869
<i>Daddy had her committed.</i>

19:40.405 --> 19:42.373
And that doctor...

19:44.209 --> 19:46.043
She hung herself in there.

19:51.916 --> 19:54.385
I really don't want
to talk about these things.

19:55.754 --> 19:58.305
<i>I don't want to talk</i>
<i>about any of these things.</i>

20:00.091 --> 20:01.925
I'm sorry.

20:04.179 --> 20:06.680
My mom, she died when I was 12.

20:11.669 --> 20:13.604
And your mom,
who was her doctor?

20:16.041 --> 20:17.908
His name's Pitlor.

20:19.944 --> 20:24.114
My father,
he is a very bad person.

20:32.540 --> 20:34.458
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
be talking to you.

20:34.460 --> 20:37.010
I just--
I have to go.

21:20.505 --> 21:24.341
Athena: I have
this memory of her

21:24.425 --> 21:26.844
in the sand.

21:29.097 --> 21:31.231
Her big dresses.

21:33.151 --> 21:34.651
Yeah.

21:34.686 --> 21:36.520
Polishing that driftwood

21:36.522 --> 21:40.023
till it shined
like steel or something.

21:44.362 --> 21:47.664
I lost her in the light.

21:47.699 --> 21:50.134
The light off the water.

21:51.469 --> 21:55.038
Why do these memories
stay so vivid

21:55.089 --> 21:58.542
when I can't even remember
stuff from last week?

21:59.761 --> 22:02.012
Those moments,
they stare back at you.

22:02.881 --> 22:04.882
You don't remember them,

22:04.933 --> 22:07.184
they remember you.

22:08.386 --> 22:10.437
Turn around, there they are.

22:12.390 --> 22:14.391
<i>Staring.</i>

22:20.765 --> 22:22.616
Maybe I could get one back.

22:25.737 --> 22:27.988
You took her knife.

22:28.039 --> 22:30.290
You said you didn't
want anything else.

22:34.913 --> 22:38.215
Thena, this Web shit,

22:38.249 --> 22:41.301
those outfits, you fall
in with some bad people.

22:41.336 --> 22:43.804
<i>I'm clean. I don't
even drink anymore.</i>

22:43.838 --> 22:46.590
I'm saving up to go to CalArts.

22:46.592 --> 22:47.891
I'm not a whore.

22:47.926 --> 22:50.294
<i>It's not like I would</i>
<i>do one of those parties.</i>

22:50.328 --> 22:51.645
What parties?

22:51.679 --> 22:54.231
Like the real hooking.
No fucking way.

22:54.265 --> 22:56.433
Where are these parties?

22:56.484 --> 22:57.768
I mean, all over.

22:57.819 --> 23:00.904
<i>Up north. But I don't
mess with that.</i>

23:00.939 --> 23:03.991
Like I'm saying, two more
months and I'm walking.

23:07.862 --> 23:10.280
I should have been
there for you.

23:12.834 --> 23:15.953
Babe, you couldn't even
be there for yourself.

23:28.850 --> 23:30.934
<i>( music playing )</i>

23:35.974 --> 23:40.777
Look, I know
how we left it, but...

23:40.812 --> 23:44.231
Look, I don't
fucking blame you.

23:46.317 --> 23:48.869
I ain't easy, I know.

23:51.823 --> 23:53.991
And what you said, I mean...

23:56.878 --> 23:58.495
I think you were right.

23:58.497 --> 24:00.547
I'm pregnant.

24:02.333 --> 24:04.217
Uh...
( clears throat )

24:14.178 --> 24:15.646
Weren't you on the pill?

24:15.680 --> 24:17.981
It's not 100%.

24:21.352 --> 24:23.720
Look, you didn't want this.

24:24.939 --> 24:27.357
But I don't believe
in abortion.

24:31.529 --> 24:35.032
I'm--
I'm keeping it, Paul.

24:39.704 --> 24:41.772
I want you to.

24:46.978 --> 24:49.212
And I think
we should get married.

24:56.220 --> 24:58.138
I don't want you to do this
because you think

24:58.189 --> 24:59.106
it's the right thing
or something.

24:59.140 --> 25:00.557
I'm not.

25:00.608 --> 25:02.559
I don't.

25:04.729 --> 25:06.997
I love you, Em.

25:07.031 --> 25:10.567
And I didn't know
and I wasn't sure

25:10.569 --> 25:13.403
until just this minute
right here

25:13.405 --> 25:15.622
hearing this.

25:15.656 --> 25:17.808
I love you.

25:23.798 --> 25:26.249
I guess I love you, too.

25:28.970 --> 25:31.171
I...

25:41.182 --> 25:43.767
This is the best thing
that could happen.

26:09.962 --> 26:12.796
Ani: Working a case down in LA.

26:12.847 --> 26:14.131
Met a man said he knew you.

26:14.182 --> 26:15.932
Said he knew me
when I was little.

26:15.967 --> 26:19.936
This psychiatrist,
Irving Pitlor.

26:19.971 --> 26:23.140
- Does that ring a bell?
- Pitlor?

26:23.142 --> 26:26.610
Ooh, yes.

26:26.644 --> 26:29.079
He was around
for a time, early '80s.

26:29.113 --> 26:31.782
Researching dynamics
of communal living.

26:31.816 --> 26:34.951
Part of Chessani's lodge,
I think.

26:34.986 --> 26:37.537
Chessani's lodge?

26:37.572 --> 26:39.039
What the fuck?

26:39.073 --> 26:40.490
You knew Chessani, too?

26:40.492 --> 26:45.045
I'm sorry, your case,
it involves these men?

26:45.079 --> 26:48.665
Theo Chessani, he would have to
be somewhere in his 90s by now.

26:48.716 --> 26:51.168
- His son.
- We have a dead body.

26:51.219 --> 26:54.004
Benjamin Caspere.

26:55.423 --> 26:57.340
I recognize him.

26:57.342 --> 26:58.842
Never spoke.

26:58.893 --> 27:01.344
He attended some seminars
here, I believe.

27:01.346 --> 27:03.096
You remember
anything about them?

27:03.147 --> 27:06.149
Those times, Chessani, Pitlor?

27:10.021 --> 27:11.738
That's Pitlor.

27:11.772 --> 27:14.691
Hard to tell, but I think that's
the Vinci mayor as a kid.

27:14.725 --> 27:17.360
<i>Jesus, that's some</i>
<i>fucking coincidence.</i>

27:17.362 --> 27:21.331
Well, a lot of spiritual movements
cross-pollinated in these parts.

27:21.365 --> 27:25.202
Being that I kept exclusively to
such company, it's not so unusual.

27:25.204 --> 27:27.704
More unusual
is that my daughter

27:27.755 --> 27:30.006
became a sheriff's detective.

27:35.096 --> 27:38.014
Oh. Your mother
took this, you know.

27:39.684 --> 27:41.885
An old soul

27:41.936 --> 27:44.020
right from the start.

27:46.474 --> 27:48.058
Excuse me.

27:48.060 --> 27:51.945
You have one of the largest
auras I've ever seen.

27:51.979 --> 27:54.264
<i>Green and black.</i>

27:54.298 --> 27:56.032
It's been taking up
this whole room.

27:56.067 --> 27:59.703
I just--
I had to say something.

28:02.874 --> 28:05.158
You must have had
hundreds of lives.

28:05.209 --> 28:08.545
I don't think I can
handle another one.

28:12.917 --> 28:16.419
What do you think
green and black means?

28:16.421 --> 28:18.004
I don't know.

28:18.055 --> 28:19.973
You're a mood ring?

28:28.900 --> 28:31.434
Ray:
We're driving to Fresno.

28:31.485 --> 28:35.155
It's not that I don't enjoy
our time together, but...

28:36.741 --> 28:37.958
When I was in Chessani's house,

28:37.992 --> 28:40.193
there were all these
soil readings for Fresno land.

28:40.244 --> 28:42.862
GPS shows Caspere
in the same areas.

28:55.744 --> 28:57.344
_

28:57.345 --> 28:59.796
Now I get why
nobody lives out here.

28:59.798 --> 29:03.633
Chessani's map went all the
way to the Lost Coast.

29:14.729 --> 29:17.247
( sighs )
So what is all this?

29:17.281 --> 29:20.984
Maybe this is where
the bodies are buried.

29:23.537 --> 29:25.205
Man: <i>It's our biggest
issue in the county.</i>

29:25.239 --> 29:27.958
- <i> Mine tailings, runoff.</i>
Ani: - Hi there.

29:27.992 --> 29:29.659
Man: <i>We're constantly
finding new contamination.</i>

29:29.710 --> 29:33.296
Like in this area here. A lot of these
mines have been closed for decades.

29:33.331 --> 29:35.966
Companies are bankrupt. There's
really no one to do the cleanup.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.885
<i>State doesn't have</i>
<i>the resources.</i>

29:38.919 --> 29:42.305
Can you think of any reason why our victim
would visit so many of these sites?

29:42.340 --> 29:44.174
I don't know.

29:44.176 --> 29:45.842
Um...

29:48.179 --> 29:49.896
Unsafe levels of lead,

29:49.930 --> 29:52.682
cadmium, arsenic,
and/or mercury.

29:52.684 --> 29:54.985
It's contaminated the water
table to such a degree,

29:55.019 --> 29:56.853
the farmland here is useless.

29:56.904 --> 29:58.605
Family farms have been
selling out for years.

29:58.656 --> 30:01.491
Whole county's turning over.
People have just given up.

30:14.205 --> 30:16.373
Malkin:
<i>It's about trust, right?</i>

30:16.424 --> 30:18.341
<i>The people in my industry,</i>

30:18.376 --> 30:21.528
<i>they can't even tell when
they're lying half the time.</i>

30:21.562 --> 30:23.797
Entitled.

30:24.882 --> 30:28.301
Hey, doll.
Look at you.

30:29.937 --> 30:31.771
This place does all right, huh?

30:31.806 --> 30:33.556
Six-figure weekends.

30:33.558 --> 30:36.526
On paper, you come in
as part owner.

30:36.560 --> 30:39.062
The club's equity guarantees
the land investment.

30:39.064 --> 30:40.397
How's the capital multiplied?

30:40.399 --> 30:42.899
In dry farmland
in the middle of the state?

30:42.983 --> 30:46.119
The rail puts the land in line for
commercial zoning and development.

30:46.153 --> 30:49.039
Fed money means cost overages.

30:49.073 --> 30:52.292
This is the last pork barrel
outside of defense.

30:54.578 --> 30:57.130
Ah, man, we were
young once, huh?

30:57.164 --> 30:59.499
I was so focused on my career.

30:59.550 --> 31:01.718
I think things worked
out well for us both.

31:01.752 --> 31:03.586
( laughs )

31:03.637 --> 31:06.756
Let me talk to my business
manager, see how liquid I can go.

31:06.807 --> 31:08.808
And I wasn't looking for
any land, you understand,

31:08.843 --> 31:12.429
but I'll definitely give
it serious consideration.

31:17.184 --> 31:19.569
I wanted to drag my heels,

31:19.603 --> 31:21.905
I'd go to a credit union.

31:23.274 --> 31:25.325
You aren't interested,

31:25.359 --> 31:27.243
why'd you take the meeting?

31:27.278 --> 31:29.529
Well, this lady asked.

31:29.580 --> 31:31.998
And I am interested.

31:32.032 --> 31:34.367
We'll kick the tires, Frank.
( pats )

31:34.418 --> 31:37.087
Trust takes time.

31:39.123 --> 31:41.040
Beautiful, you call me.

31:41.092 --> 31:42.726
Lunch.

31:46.297 --> 31:48.798
I told you he was a dipshit.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.633
But not too much of one

31:50.684 --> 31:53.970
to avoid this colorful
shared history.

31:54.021 --> 31:56.239
I was a kid

31:56.273 --> 31:59.225
and he never pulled
anybody's teeth out.

31:59.276 --> 32:00.944
This gonna get fucking worse,

32:00.978 --> 32:03.029
what I gotta do.

32:03.063 --> 32:04.647
You get that, right?

32:04.698 --> 32:06.616
But just like that,
you're back here.

32:06.650 --> 32:09.652
Have I somehow given you the
impression I've got a choice?

32:09.703 --> 32:12.739
Caspere, my fucking
life's savings, Stan.

32:12.790 --> 32:16.126
Congratulations,
we're club owners again.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.077
I'm saying it seems fast.

32:18.129 --> 32:21.831
Maybe we should take some time for
ourselves, talk this through.

32:21.882 --> 32:23.333
Things move fast now, babe.

32:23.335 --> 32:24.884
Someone hit
the fucking warp drive

32:24.919 --> 32:26.386
and I'm trying to navigate
through the blur.

32:26.420 --> 32:28.838
( snaps fingers ) It's moment to
moment and you just wasted my time

32:28.840 --> 32:30.640
on your fairy
producer boyfriend.

32:30.674 --> 32:32.725
Your time, is it?

32:32.760 --> 32:35.094
- Your time.
- Mm-hmm.

32:35.146 --> 32:36.646
My boyfriend.

32:36.680 --> 32:38.231
Here's an idea.

32:38.265 --> 32:40.984
Let's be one of those
couples that fights a lot.

32:41.018 --> 32:43.153
That's a fucking great idea.

33:14.718 --> 33:16.219
Yeah.

33:16.221 --> 33:18.388
Yeah, this is them.

33:19.473 --> 33:20.940
Guy that pawned these,
you got video?

33:20.975 --> 33:24.194
It was a girl.
Still got the tape.

33:32.736 --> 33:35.572
Car gets processed,
we might get something.

33:35.574 --> 33:37.407
But that was him.

33:37.441 --> 33:40.577
And I'd like state to know Velcoro
put himself in harm's way for me.

33:40.579 --> 33:43.413
Where's Davis?
I want to talk to her.

33:43.415 --> 33:45.665
Anything you want to tell me?

33:45.716 --> 33:48.051
About you and Velcoro?

33:48.085 --> 33:50.303
No. Why?

33:50.337 --> 33:52.772
Detective...
( sighs )

33:52.806 --> 33:56.843
Look, honey, there's been
a formal complaint lodged.

33:56.877 --> 33:59.062
Sexual misconduct.

33:59.096 --> 34:00.313
Against who?

34:00.347 --> 34:01.764
You, for Christ's sake.

34:01.815 --> 34:03.900
Wait, what?

34:05.319 --> 34:08.237
Deputy Steven Mercer.

34:08.272 --> 34:11.107
<i>Conducting a relationship</i>
<i>with a subordinate.</i>

34:11.109 --> 34:12.909
<i>That's called coercion.</i>

34:12.943 --> 34:14.643
<i>You attended the seminar.</i>

34:14.678 --> 34:16.579
Is this for real?

34:22.585 --> 34:26.322
You do realize they're all giving
Mercer high fives out there, right?

34:28.592 --> 34:30.009
What I do outside work--

34:30.043 --> 34:33.880
This isn't outside work.
This is an IA complaint.

34:33.931 --> 34:35.598
And I was subsequently
made aware

34:35.632 --> 34:37.634
of your relationship
with Detective Ilinca.

34:37.685 --> 34:40.469
Oh, for fuck--

34:40.521 --> 34:42.472
once.

34:42.474 --> 34:44.690
Once.

34:44.725 --> 34:47.060
Partners?
I mean...

34:47.110 --> 34:49.646
What, you're telling me that's
some kind of first for this place?

34:49.697 --> 34:52.114
Unofficially, admin
doesn't stick its nose in

34:52.149 --> 34:54.701
until a situation's created
that disturbs the department.

34:54.735 --> 34:57.987
Okay, so if I had married
Mercer, this'd be okay?

34:57.989 --> 35:02.292
Imagine that. You adopting a
position of righteous indignation.

35:02.326 --> 35:04.243
<i>He was your subordinate.</i>

35:04.295 --> 35:06.212
<i>That means you had</i>
<i>power over him.</i>

35:06.246 --> 35:07.664
<i>County has to investigate.</i>

35:07.666 --> 35:09.332
This would not
be happening to a man.

35:09.334 --> 35:12.051
If a complain were lodged,
you bet it would.

35:12.086 --> 35:13.920
They just wouldn't be able
to use that line.

35:13.971 --> 35:16.172
I don't have anything
to apologize for.

35:16.174 --> 35:18.474
<i>I'd consider altering that tune</i>

35:18.509 --> 35:20.543
<i>before professional</i>
<i>standards talks to you.</i>

35:20.577 --> 35:22.929
And until their
investigation is concluded,

35:23.013 --> 35:24.847
you cannot enter this building.

35:25.983 --> 35:28.518
Wait a--
( scoffs )

35:30.020 --> 35:31.571
I'm suspended?

35:31.605 --> 35:33.439
<i>Since you got</i>
<i>this state detail,</i>

35:33.490 --> 35:35.108
<i>you'll keep working on that</i>
<i>as a special investigator,</i>

35:35.159 --> 35:39.062
but right now you're on departmental
leave pending investigation.

35:42.583 --> 35:46.536
Listen, there's some word

35:46.587 --> 35:48.254
you got gambling debts.

35:48.288 --> 35:51.791
<i>That comes up, they'll want
to look at your bank records.</i>

35:51.842 --> 35:53.926
I'd straighten
them out if you can.

35:56.714 --> 35:59.465
Does this have anything
to do with that mayor?

35:59.516 --> 36:01.217
Vinci? Chessani?

36:03.604 --> 36:07.056
Look, I don't care
who you sleep with

36:07.107 --> 36:10.443
so long as you find them
outside this department.

36:10.477 --> 36:12.445
Ani, come on.

36:12.479 --> 36:13.946
You know as well as I do

36:13.981 --> 36:17.483
<i>no grown woman in her right
mind would date a cop.</i>

36:23.374 --> 36:24.991
Hey.

36:25.042 --> 36:26.342
You're gonna leave
just like that?

36:26.377 --> 36:28.294
Not allowed in the building.

36:28.328 --> 36:31.381
And it never hit you this might
come back some way you don't like?

36:31.415 --> 36:32.665
You talked to them?

36:32.716 --> 36:36.753
They asked questions.
And Mercer, really?

36:36.804 --> 36:39.172
This has to do with you
and me, doesn't it?

36:39.223 --> 36:41.057
Hey, I didn't slap
no complaint on you.

36:41.091 --> 36:42.759
Forget my fucking
busted marriage.

36:42.810 --> 36:45.511
Oh, your marriage
was busted years ago.

36:45.562 --> 36:48.231
Or you never would have
been in that hotel.

36:48.265 --> 36:50.400
You didn't even
give it a chance.

36:52.186 --> 36:54.570
There was no chance.

36:54.605 --> 36:56.606
Fuck!

36:56.608 --> 36:58.775
Fuck this, partner.

36:58.826 --> 37:00.193
Fuck off.

37:00.244 --> 37:02.862
Fuck off? I've been
a friend to you.

37:02.913 --> 37:05.782
- ( engine starts )
- With friends like these...

37:14.792 --> 37:17.226
<i>( bell ringing )</i>

37:17.261 --> 37:19.095
Call came in from
an El Monte pawnshop.

37:19.129 --> 37:20.930
<i>Irina Rulfo.</i>

37:20.964 --> 37:23.466
<i>Priors-- solicitation,</i>
<i>possession.</i>

37:23.517 --> 37:26.385
- Who's your fucking Sherlock now?
- Right.

37:26.437 --> 37:29.272
Paul: <i>She pawned the stuff
taken from Caspere's house.</i>

37:29.306 --> 37:32.308
No history of B&E
or assault, but...

37:33.527 --> 37:37.230
Ledo Amarilla.
Priors for assault, B&E,

37:37.264 --> 37:38.781
pandering, possession
of a deadly weapon.

37:38.816 --> 37:40.650
We had prints run ASAP.

37:40.701 --> 37:43.369
Jewelry came back
with Caspere's,

37:43.403 --> 37:46.322
Rulfo's and Amarilla's prints.

37:46.373 --> 37:48.157
This is real?

37:48.208 --> 37:51.494
Paul: <i>APBs out in Los
Angeles and Ventura County.</i>

37:51.496 --> 37:53.579
Our job now is to locate

37:53.630 --> 37:55.298
and arrest
on the charges of murder.

37:55.332 --> 37:58.501
Idea, of course, is that chica
was turning tricks with Caspere.

37:58.503 --> 38:00.887
<i>Got a look at how he lived.</i>

38:00.921 --> 38:04.474
Ledo and possible accomplices
tortured him for his valuables.

38:04.508 --> 38:06.893
We've got known KAs
for Ledo and Irina listed.

38:06.927 --> 38:08.177
Let's check them out.

38:08.228 --> 38:10.847
Hit up working girls for anything
about Irina and Caspere.

38:19.907 --> 38:22.658
Dixon, follow up with canvass.

38:22.693 --> 38:24.911
Split those KAs up
with the other dicks.

38:24.995 --> 38:26.696
Woodrugh, work prosts
looking for Irina.

38:26.698 --> 38:29.198
Anything come from hookerland?

38:29.249 --> 38:31.667
Tascha was a hooker.
Hasn't been around.

38:31.702 --> 38:34.754
Rumors of elite parties
Caspere might have attended.

38:34.788 --> 38:37.707
High-end girls.
That's about it.

38:37.709 --> 38:40.376
All right, well, we got
this to focus on anyway.

38:43.347 --> 38:45.765
<i>( guitar playing )</i>

- Mm-hmm.

39:09.940 --> 39:12.408
Guy's a pimp.

39:12.410 --> 39:15.878
Pawnshop has one of his girls
selling Caspere's stuff.

39:15.913 --> 39:19.148
So he's pawning shit.

39:19.183 --> 39:21.918
May be safe to say
this guy ain't got my money.

39:21.920 --> 39:25.254
Not unless Caspere had it in
a suitcase at his fuck pad.

39:28.592 --> 39:30.893
What the fuck would this spic
have to do with Stan?

39:30.928 --> 39:33.262

So I'm getting back
into some things.

40:03.176 --> 40:05.344
Got my club again.

40:05.379 --> 40:07.296
Some other stuff.

40:09.850 --> 40:11.183
Thought that was behind you.

40:11.218 --> 40:13.636
I thought being poor
was behind me, too.

40:13.687 --> 40:17.073
That shit never leaves you.

40:17.107 --> 40:19.609
Doesn't matter how much
money you make.

40:22.312 --> 40:24.847
I'm enjoying this soberish you

40:24.881 --> 40:27.483
where your head doesn't dip
and fall when I talk.

40:29.319 --> 40:33.823
Things I got coming, I could
use you in a fuller capacity.

40:33.857 --> 40:36.459
Maybe it's time to put
this cop shit to bed.

40:36.493 --> 40:38.394
Come with me.

40:40.130 --> 40:42.131
I'm not muscle, Frank.

40:42.165 --> 40:44.000
You're smart.

40:44.002 --> 40:46.836
Keep your head out the bottle.

40:46.870 --> 40:48.738
It's just...

40:51.675 --> 40:54.343
all your talent's
going to waste.

40:55.562 --> 40:57.596
In the things I'm planning...

41:01.318 --> 41:03.686
black rage goes a long way.

41:05.522 --> 41:07.356
A long way to where?

41:07.407 --> 41:10.693
Sometimes your worst self

41:10.744 --> 41:12.628
is your best self.

41:12.663 --> 41:14.363
You know what I'm saying?

41:24.174 --> 41:26.425
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

41:26.460 --> 41:28.511
I wanted to give you this.

41:28.545 --> 41:31.097
It's your grandfather's.

41:31.131 --> 41:33.265
I thought you should have it.

41:33.300 --> 41:36.218
You know, remember me with.

41:37.604 --> 41:39.605
Are you going away?

41:42.476 --> 41:44.193
Oh...

41:49.066 --> 41:51.867
And don't let Mom
or Richard see that.

41:51.902 --> 41:54.737
All right?
You hide it.

41:54.739 --> 41:57.406
You can look at it when
you want to remember me.

41:57.408 --> 41:59.125
It's Grandpa's.

41:59.159 --> 42:01.160
Yeah, my father,

42:01.211 --> 42:03.462
me, you.

42:03.497 --> 42:06.048
Come here.
Come here.

42:10.837 --> 42:13.339
Where you come from,

42:13.390 --> 42:16.559
that'll mean something
to you one day.

42:17.978 --> 42:19.428
Okay.

42:19.430 --> 42:20.596
All right.

42:20.598 --> 42:23.349
Gena:
<i>Chad?</i>

42:23.400 --> 42:26.602
Chad, what are you doing out there?
Come back inside.

42:26.653 --> 42:28.404
Just a minute.

42:36.113 --> 42:38.197
Frank: <i>Looks like maybe
we got an answer here.</i>

42:38.248 --> 42:40.416
Ledo Amarilla.

42:40.450 --> 42:41.867
A pimp.

42:41.918 --> 42:43.836
<i>Some Santa Muerte association.</i>

42:45.539 --> 42:46.622
And this was Mexico?

42:46.673 --> 42:48.290
Find this fuck.

42:48.292 --> 42:50.376
He owes me a long conversation.

42:50.427 --> 42:52.261
Come back with hard targets.

42:54.131 --> 42:56.015
You stay.

42:58.885 --> 43:03.639
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

43:03.641 --> 43:05.975
I'm looking
for an outside read,

43:05.977 --> 43:08.060
events, and you go
out of pocket?

43:08.111 --> 43:11.530
You know how I can
get with a girl.

43:11.565 --> 43:14.417
Pull myself together and Ivar's
banging on my door about Stan.

43:14.451 --> 43:18.737
You and Osip talked a while
when he was at the Soho.

43:18.789 --> 43:21.907
When he showed up,
he was pleased to see you.

43:21.958 --> 43:24.293
I don't know what
that's supposed to mean.

43:24.327 --> 43:27.463
You tell me entertain
him, I entertain.

43:27.497 --> 43:29.381
( chuckles )

43:31.835 --> 43:34.170
You got this
Roger Moore thing, huh?

43:35.672 --> 43:37.840
Johnny Unflappable.

43:39.142 --> 43:42.261
Must be my predilection
for virtue.

43:46.817 --> 43:48.684
You know the word louche?

43:51.321 --> 43:55.157
Somebody's pulling me
out on the streets

43:55.192 --> 43:56.775
and you're louche.

44:00.430 --> 44:02.114
Stay up here.

44:03.750 --> 44:05.534
You're pit boss tonight.

44:05.585 --> 44:07.536
What?

44:07.587 --> 44:09.839
( laughs )
Frank, come on.

44:09.873 --> 44:12.208
I haven't bossed
in, like, three years.

44:12.210 --> 44:13.926
Maybe get used to it.

44:13.960 --> 44:15.594
Till you show me something.

44:25.222 --> 44:28.891
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

44:28.893 --> 44:30.392
There's something there.

44:30.394 --> 44:32.194
This new generation,

44:32.229 --> 44:34.446
everybody wants to go
straight to the top.

44:36.483 --> 44:40.102
Last week Chessani said
somebody wants the poker room.

44:40.136 --> 44:42.404
- Who?
- He was vague.

44:42.406 --> 44:46.242
He implied he was choosing sides
now that I'm broke and all.

44:51.381 --> 44:53.716
People take chances.

44:58.054 --> 45:00.256
Is this worth sticking out?

45:00.258 --> 45:02.258
We walk away now...

45:04.561 --> 45:06.529
what do we walk with?

45:27.751 --> 45:30.035
( chatter )

45:38.461 --> 45:41.063
( chatter )

45:48.221 --> 45:50.806
Ani: <i>One of Dixon's old CIs
tipped us to Amarilla.</i>

45:50.840 --> 45:53.559
Cousin rents a warehouse off 6th.
That's where they crash.

45:53.610 --> 45:56.729
Dixon's called in surveillance.
Our man just got home.

45:56.780 --> 46:00.199
Now, state can't get us a tactical squad
till later, but we don't want to lose him.

46:00.233 --> 46:02.618
You feel all this
manpower is warranted?

46:02.652 --> 46:05.154
Better safe
than something else.

46:06.456 --> 46:09.792
- All right.
- Let's be careful out there.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.486
<i>( crowd chanting )</i>
<i>Save our transit!</i>

46:37.520 --> 46:40.489
Reporter: <i>Citizens who

Ani: All right, you two at the
door with Velcoro and me.

46:57.757 --> 46:58.957
Woodrugh and Dixon
will back us.

46:59.009 --> 47:00.542
Everybody else
form up a perimeter.

47:00.544 --> 47:03.262
He's still in there. We
might wait for him to exit.

47:03.296 --> 47:05.347
No, bosses said take him.

47:05.382 --> 47:07.516
Let's go.

47:25.385 --> 47:27.703
- Cut through. Cover the back.
- Okay.
