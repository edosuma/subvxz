Previously on The Last Man On Earth.

00:03.542 --> 00:06.106
Todd is snooping around,
trying to figure out

00:06.125 --> 00:08.125
- if I'm pregnant yet.
- So?

00:08.167 --> 00:09.959
- Sorry, Todd.
- Bottom line,

00:10.083 --> 00:11.042
she wants a baby,

00:11.127 --> 00:13.194
and you're her only shot.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.062
We've got company.

00:15.090 --> 00:18.078
I'm telling you, someone's out there.

00:18.171 --> 00:19.300
Mike.

00:23.876 --> 00:25.418

I love it.

03:08.538 --> 03:10.271
Top of the morning, mons.

03:10.339 --> 03:13.040
Oh, praise Jah. I found you.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.042
- What's with the dreads?
- Oh, just

03:15.111 --> 03:18.584
a fun ting to distract me
from me natty toothache, mon.

03:18.609 --> 03:21.082
Oof. But dere's no time for dat.

03:21.150 --> 03:22.416
Look, guys, hey.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.251
I'm gonna drop my pitch-perfect accent

03:24.320 --> 03:25.352
'cause this is serious.

03:25.421 --> 03:27.254
Look, I have something
to show you. Come on.

03:29.516 --> 03:30.815
So, when I woke up this morning,

03:30.840 --> 03:33.307
I heard noises coming from the tent.

03:33.605 --> 03:34.904
Jasper's back?

03:34.929 --> 03:36.230
Well, I assume it's him.

03:36.332 --> 03:38.099
I mean, who else could it be?

03:38.167 --> 03:40.434
So, I figured that we could
all welcome him back together.

03:40.503 --> 03:45.039
So let's all say a big hello
to Jasper on three, okay?

03:45.108 --> 03:48.175
One. Two. Three!

03:48.209 --> 03:50.918
Hello, Jasper!

03:50.966 --> 03:51.908
Wait.

03:51.933 --> 03:55.170
Jasper? Or whoever was in here?

03:55.195 --> 03:56.250
Oh, you're looking for me?

04:01.750 --> 04:04.158
Oh, my God! Oh, what did you do?

04:04.260 --> 04:06.260
We just wanted to surprise you.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.995
Oh. Oh,

04:08.064 --> 04:09.363
- Mike.
- Boo!

04:09.432 --> 04:10.998
What?

04:16.613 --> 04:17.817
Blanks.

04:18.827 --> 04:21.007
You are sick, Gail!

04:21.077 --> 04:22.176
Sick!

04:22.476 --> 04:23.609
Burn.

04:24.198 --> 04:26.666
So, then I cross over into Colorado,

04:26.667 --> 04:28.667
and by this point I'm exhausted

04:28.705 --> 04:30.317
and I'm starving and I'm thirsty,

04:30.386 --> 04:32.747
'cause all the rainwater
I'd collected... it was gone.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.422
Uh, so, I found this,
this creek, and I, uh...

04:35.491 --> 04:38.259
I'm kneeling down to fill up my canteen.

04:38.294 --> 04:40.427
And I look down into
the water, and there's...

04:40.496 --> 04:43.197
I-I see there's, like, something shiny.

04:43.266 --> 04:45.540
So I reach down, and I grab hold of it,

04:45.565 --> 04:49.136
and it ended up being a
handle to some kind of hatch.

04:50.339 --> 04:52.173
- A hatch to what?
- I mean,

04:52.241 --> 04:53.407
before I could find out, just boom,

04:53.476 --> 04:55.176
this bag comes down over my head.

04:55.244 --> 04:56.377
What kind of bag?

04:56.445 --> 04:58.871
Like a-a paper bag,
plastic, uh, straw, tote?

04:58.938 --> 05:00.181
- Was it tote?
- Tandy,

05:00.283 --> 05:03.317
no one gives a flying burrito
about what kind of bag it was.

05:03.386 --> 05:06.220
Excuse me for trying to
establish a motif, Gail.

05:06.289 --> 05:07.637
So, I can't see anything.

05:07.662 --> 05:09.248
When the bag is finally
taken off my head,

05:09.250 --> 05:11.250
I am surrounded by dozens of people.

05:11.327 --> 05:13.127
- What'd they do to you? 
- They-they

05:13.162 --> 05:14.395
chained me up for months.

05:14.463 --> 05:16.430
Uh, they-they tortured
me, they drugged me.

05:16.532 --> 05:18.971
They-they, you know,
experimented on me.

05:19.014 --> 05:20.046
I-I mean, the whole nine...

05:20.071 --> 05:21.736
Nueve. Ocho is eight.

05:21.761 --> 05:24.104
Yeah. So, eventually,
I-I was able to escape.

05:24.173 --> 05:25.856
I have no idea where
I am, and these guards

05:25.881 --> 05:27.174
are chasing after me, so I quickly duck

05:27.243 --> 05:28.930
into this file room to hide.

05:28.955 --> 05:33.173
And, guys, what I found in
there is gonna blow your minds.

05:36.599 --> 05:38.152
I found us.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.054
- What?
- Dozens

05:40.122 --> 05:42.621
and dozens of files
about each one of us.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.225
I'm talking with photographs,

05:44.327 --> 05:46.393
uh, your medical records,
personal information,

05:46.462 --> 05:48.495
- everything.
- What are you saying?

05:48.564 --> 05:50.331
What I'm saying is, I don't think

05:50.417 --> 05:52.376
that we are just survivors.

05:54.792 --> 05:56.980
We're designated survivors.

05:57.005 --> 05:58.038
Oh!

05:58.107 --> 05:59.668
Oh, my God.

05:59.709 --> 06:00.792
But

06:00.805 --> 06:02.320
the scariest part of this all,

06:02.345 --> 06:04.856
and-and it truly chills me to the bone

06:04.881 --> 06:08.468
to even think about,
but... is that I am...

06:08.501 --> 06:09.918
completely messing with you guys,

06:09.941 --> 06:10.924
and this whole story is B.S.

06:10.949 --> 06:12.086
- Oh!
- What?!

06:12.154 --> 06:13.287
Oh.

06:13.356 --> 06:16.290
Ah! Ah!

06:16.325 --> 06:18.669
No, I saw one of your poop balloons.

06:18.694 --> 06:22.196
Mike Miller! Oh, gar!

06:22.265 --> 06:24.131
- So, you never got the virus?
- No. It must've

06:24.233 --> 06:25.299
been something else.

06:25.368 --> 06:27.522
I-I assume my immune system was weak

06:27.547 --> 06:29.069
from being up in space for so long, but,

06:29.138 --> 06:30.371
yeah, no. I don't know. Anyway, once

06:30.439 --> 06:32.798
I fully recovered, I, you
know, went straight to Malibu,

06:32.823 --> 06:34.341
but you guys had already left.

06:34.410 --> 06:36.652
But I-I left you a note in Tucson.

06:37.210 --> 06:39.010
I didn't see a note.

06:50.751 --> 06:52.043

06:52.125 --> 06:56.216

07:08.167 --> 07:10.501
Uh... it, it doesn't matter now.

07:10.532 --> 07:12.633
Look who just woke up.

07:14.737 --> 07:16.150
Oh, my God.

07:16.863 --> 07:17.985
Is that...?

07:18.087 --> 07:19.486
Yeah. Come on.

07:22.645 --> 07:25.192
Mike, I'd like you
to meet our daughters.

07:25.261 --> 07:27.961
This is Bezequille, and this one...

07:28.617 --> 07:29.949
is Mike.

07:31.292 --> 07:32.751
Named her after Mike Clarke Duncan.

07:32.754 --> 07:34.788
Big Green Mile fans. Yeah.

07:36.138 --> 07:39.340
JK. Named her after you.

07:41.709 --> 07:42.834
Hey.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.531
Hi.

07:46.542 --> 07:49.084
It's good to have you back, Mike.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.751
So, this is Dawn.

07:50.792 --> 07:52.626
Oh-ho-ho, look at that.

07:52.678 --> 07:55.189
You guys got babies all over
the place around here now.

07:55.257 --> 07:58.092
So, you were saying that
it's you and Dawn and...

07:58.160 --> 08:00.127
- Gail in here?
- Yeah.

08:00.196 --> 08:01.962
Uh, Gail and I, actually...

08:02.530 --> 08:03.996
we got married.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.127
Oh.

08:06.709 --> 08:09.001
Oh. I mean... congrats.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.575
Congrats. Th-Th-That's,
uh, well, that's great.

08:11.615 --> 08:13.801
Look, I know this might be weird,

08:14.268 --> 08:16.076
'cause we...

08:17.000 --> 08:18.083
we had that kiss.

08:18.147 --> 08:20.571
No. Hey, seriously, Erica,

08:20.675 --> 08:22.609
I-I'm just really happy for you.

08:23.691 --> 08:25.524
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

08:26.542 --> 08:28.043
Oh, hey, Todd.

08:28.621 --> 08:29.562
What's up?

08:29.587 --> 08:31.392
I... just, uh,

08:32.155 --> 08:34.861
didn't realize, um,
Mi-Mike was in here.

08:34.955 --> 08:37.562
- Yeah.
- Hey, Mike. Todd.

08:38.022 --> 08:39.922
No, I know you, Todd.

08:40.096 --> 08:42.436
And we've been hanging
out all morning. I...

08:42.869 --> 08:44.071
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

08:44.173 --> 08:47.007
Um, so, uh, you, uh...

08:47.626 --> 08:49.876
happen to tell him
about our thing, or...?

08:50.409 --> 08:53.447
I mean, I-I hadn't...
exactly got to that yet.

08:53.516 --> 08:55.082
'C-Cause it's not a thing anymore?

08:55.151 --> 08:56.722
Or you just haven't gotten to it yet?

08:56.792 --> 08:58.875
- Can we talk about this later, please?
- Yeah.

08:59.128 --> 09:01.293
That's not even why I came in here.

09:01.955 --> 09:04.126
So why did you come in here, then?

09:06.102 --> 09:07.840
Yeah, 'c-cause I heard, uh...

09:07.865 --> 09:10.711
this thing is wobbling, is all.

09:10.773 --> 09:12.673
You know, and I'm always like,

09:12.698 --> 09:14.498
"Not on my watch, ya heard?"

09:14.665 --> 09:16.203
Let's see what's going on here.

09:16.272 --> 09:17.271
That's...

09:17.876 --> 09:20.251
And there's the problem. See?

09:20.451 --> 09:21.761
Right there.

09:22.625 --> 09:23.977
Hear that little wobble?

09:30.052 --> 09:32.152
Yeah.

09:32.777 --> 09:34.221
It's all fixed.

09:34.630 --> 09:36.970
All right, th... thanks, Todd.

09:41.375 --> 09:44.917
So, Todd and I are, um...
we're trying to have a baby.

09:44.928 --> 09:46.328
Another baby, huh?

09:46.361 --> 09:48.668
- Just diving right back in.
- Yeah.

09:48.723 --> 09:49.923
- That's great.
- Yeah.

09:49.948 --> 09:53.140
Yeah. So, are he and Melissa
not together anymore, then?

09:53.209 --> 09:55.275
- No, they are.
- Oh, okay.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.762
Okay. So he's just...

09:57.787 --> 09:59.112
he's, like, a sperm donor, then?

09:59.181 --> 10:00.314
Kind of like that.

10:00.416 --> 10:02.149
M-Mostly like that.

10:05.501 --> 10:07.415
Yep, no just leaves. It's all right.

10:07.459 --> 10:09.918
Okay, we got some steps coming
in... going into the van.

10:09.959 --> 10:12.253
- Just... Don't... No. Hold on.
- You said steps!

10:12.292 --> 10:13.417
I know. They're right here.

10:13.479 --> 10:15.237
Th... There.

10:15.351 --> 10:16.550
Yep. Bingo.

10:16.584 --> 10:18.293
- Keep your eyes closed. No peeking.
- Okay. Okay.

10:18.384 --> 10:20.050
No peeking. Watch out on the right.

10:20.097 --> 10:22.486
- Okay. Almost. You ready?
- Yeah.

10:23.157 --> 10:24.952
Ta-da!

10:24.977 --> 10:26.090
Diego!

10:26.158 --> 10:28.292
And Clementine! The whole gang!

10:28.394 --> 10:30.160
Terence, Trent, Darby

10:30.250 --> 10:31.500
hanging together as usual.

10:31.597 --> 10:34.431
Oh, I've missed these guys so
much. Thanks for bringing 'em.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.367
No, are you kidding me? Thank you.

10:36.435 --> 10:38.842
Yeah, I mean, I was
genuinely shocked at...

10:39.292 --> 10:40.375
how close I actually got to them.

10:40.506 --> 10:42.206
Well, I mean, except Darby.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.333
- Oh?
- Who is, you know, kind of a tool.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.580
Cut him a little slack...
He had a rough upbringing

10:46.626 --> 10:49.210
on account of how much
he looks like a scrotum.

10:49.211 --> 10:50.180
Hmm.

10:50.249 --> 10:51.382
Well, now I feel bad.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.913
No, no, no, no, don't.
He is a friggin' tool.

10:53.938 --> 10:55.805
- Hmm.
- Yeah, to be sure.

10:56.334 --> 10:58.543
So, uh, yeah, why don't
you give me the tour?

10:58.570 --> 10:59.636
What is all this stuff?

10:59.684 --> 11:01.125
I mean, this puppy's fully loaded.

11:01.193 --> 11:03.679
I got everything. Um,
got a backup generator,

11:03.704 --> 11:06.440
computers, printers, I got
a satellite dish up on top.

11:06.465 --> 11:08.098
Oh. What is this thing?

11:08.167 --> 11:10.817
Oh, yeah, that...
well, this, uh, this is

11:10.950 --> 11:12.513
thermal imaging, you know?

11:12.538 --> 11:14.720
It basically uses satellites
to find heat signatures.

11:14.751 --> 11:17.960
Get out of town. Like
how the Predator sees?

11:18.033 --> 11:19.109
If that helps you, sure.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.708
Uh, but, I mean, it's a little
tricky to decipher stuff,

11:21.733 --> 11:23.695
but, I mean, I'm getting
better at it, so, uh...

11:23.720 --> 11:26.369
This is a, uh, moose in Siberia.

11:26.662 --> 11:28.195
I'm guessing that was a few birds,

11:28.220 --> 11:29.544
uh, down in Australia.

11:29.569 --> 11:30.857
I found your buddy Jasper.

11:30.882 --> 11:32.982
- Ah, that's so cool.
- Yeah, this thing really,

11:33.029 --> 11:35.516
um... really kept me going out there.

11:35.562 --> 11:38.497
You know, and, um...
during the dark times

11:38.542 --> 11:41.709
when I was, uh, at my loneliest, um...

11:42.021 --> 11:45.956
I would just... sit
down and search for life.

11:46.959 --> 11:49.793
Well... you found it.

11:49.842 --> 11:50.941
I did.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.643
- Yeah.
- I did.

11:54.459 --> 11:57.251
I thought I'd never see you again.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.516
Yeah. Yeah, um...

11:59.585 --> 12:01.307
So, hey, do you want
me to give you a hand

12:01.332 --> 12:03.265
bringing these guys in the house, or...?

12:04.890 --> 12:06.390
No.

12:06.492 --> 12:08.425
You keep 'em.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.374
We're speaking off the public record

12:12.375 --> 12:13.896
and on the private record here.

12:13.933 --> 12:16.834
I'm spinning out a little
bit about Mike being back.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.836
I mean, you know, he's handsome,

12:18.904 --> 12:20.637
single, effortless charisma,

12:20.706 --> 12:22.406
and I'm just worried that Erica's

12:22.475 --> 12:24.255
gonna see what we all see.

12:24.280 --> 12:27.878
You know? That he's obviously
the better option as a dad.

12:27.947 --> 12:31.128
I mean, it's like... you do the math.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.584
I've already done the
math, and you're right...

12:33.619 --> 12:35.786
He's definitely a great option.

12:35.834 --> 12:37.793
I thought you were gonna say
something to calm me down, hon.

12:38.361 --> 12:40.624
Oh, relax, Todd. She's just greasing

12:40.709 --> 12:43.627
- your tractor skids.
- I wish I were, Gail.

12:43.662 --> 12:46.463
Okay? But we're dealing
with an alpha dog.

12:46.542 --> 12:48.834
And, Todd... I mean
this in the best way...

12:48.901 --> 12:50.901
But you're... you're a solid beta.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.903
I know. What are we gonna do?

12:53.005 --> 12:54.612
- Just go talk to him.
- We don't want

12:54.626 --> 12:56.460
to make him feel uncomfortable.

12:56.542 --> 12:58.460
You know? Look, how about this?

12:58.544 --> 13:01.982
I'll write him a fair
but firmly worded note,

13:02.042 --> 13:04.918
and I'll pick out a card stock
that shows I mean business.

13:05.088 --> 13:07.860
You know? And we'll...
we'll sign it from the group.

13:07.885 --> 13:10.854
Todd, just talk to him.
He's a reasonable guy.

13:10.923 --> 13:12.307
You're right.

13:12.332 --> 13:14.299
You know what, I'm
just gonna go down there

13:14.324 --> 13:16.760
and ask him what the deal is, you know,

13:16.795 --> 13:19.431
and-and if he says he wants
to have a baby with Erica,

13:19.471 --> 13:21.632
then, you know, out
comes the stationery.

As you know, Erica and
I have an agreement.

14:35.740 --> 14:37.739
And I'm not letting anything
get in the way of that.

14:37.764 --> 14:40.327
Uh... Mike, can you give us a-a minute?

14:40.689 --> 14:42.489
Uh, sure, yeah.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.466
What's up, bud?

14:46.743 --> 14:48.014
Choose.

14:48.383 --> 14:49.203
What?

14:49.228 --> 14:50.504
Him or me? Who's it gonna be?

14:51.077 --> 14:52.239
He's my brother.

14:52.710 --> 14:54.208
So you choose him?

14:54.276 --> 14:56.377
I'm not choosing anyone.

14:57.175 --> 14:59.446
You've already made your choice, bud.

15:13.542 --> 15:14.751
_

15:14.776 --> 15:15.942
_

15:15.959 --> 15:16.959
_

15:23.125 --> 15:24.100
Hi, Todd.

15:24.125 --> 15:25.208
I didn't do it.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.917
You, uh...

15:27.959 --> 15:29.168
didn't do what?

15:29.193 --> 15:31.072
I didn't vandalize your truck.

15:31.083 --> 15:32.834
- Oh, you didn't, huh?
- Nope.

15:32.876 --> 15:35.710
I walked by it, it was
in, uh, pristine condition,

15:36.232 --> 15:38.255
and then I came in here, and, you know,

15:38.292 --> 15:40.584
I've been modeling ever since.

15:40.862 --> 15:42.460
Haven't seen a soul.

15:42.499 --> 15:44.295
Well, uh, if you haven't seen a soul,

15:44.320 --> 15:46.902
- how did you know it was vand...
- Look, I didn't do it, okay?

15:46.918 --> 15:49.252
It was Los Punkos, a Mexican gang.

15:49.292 --> 15:50.417
Street toughs.

15:51.483 --> 15:53.251
Look, Todd, I'm not gonna...

15:53.610 --> 15:55.212
pretend to understand what's going on

15:55.237 --> 15:58.099
inside that head of yours
right now, but, um...

15:58.125 --> 15:59.917
well, just so we're clear,

15:59.959 --> 16:03.342
I'm not here to do anything but
see my brother and my friends.

16:03.367 --> 16:04.702
Is that so?

16:05.698 --> 16:07.189
Yeah.

16:07.584 --> 16:09.793
And just to be even more clear, I...

16:09.834 --> 16:12.543
I consider you to be
one of those friends.

16:13.414 --> 16:14.564
Really?

16:14.599 --> 16:16.766
Yeah, really.

16:16.801 --> 16:19.402
Look, as a... a friend...

16:19.437 --> 16:22.905
who has spent most of
the last four years...

16:23.244 --> 16:26.642
completely alone, I-I'd love
to offer you some advice.

16:26.678 --> 16:29.745
You know, I'd encourage
you to count your blessings.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.228
You're married to an incredible woman,

16:32.442 --> 16:34.253
and you've got a second incredible woman

16:34.278 --> 16:36.055
that wants to have your baby.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.499
And you live with a family
of people who love you.

16:40.549 --> 16:43.759
Well, I'd hate for you
to take that for granted.

16:44.206 --> 16:46.739
'Cause that would be a real shame.

16:56.542 --> 16:57.917
Knock, knock.

16:57.959 --> 16:59.209
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:59.292 --> 17:01.334
Look, I-I don't know if now
is a good time for you...

17:01.402 --> 17:04.547
- No, no, no, it's a good time.
- Oh, great. Good, 'cause I...

17:06.375 --> 17:08.791
Look, I have... I have something
I really need to say to you.

17:08.834 --> 17:11.167
- Todd... 
- Look, I-I just really owe you an apology.

17:11.209 --> 17:13.459
Since we started
trying to have a baby...

17:14.169 --> 17:15.758
I haven't been myself.

17:16.029 --> 17:17.795
The way I've been acting

17:17.834 --> 17:20.916
has damaged the relationships I cherish.

17:21.598 --> 17:22.832
And for what?

17:23.435 --> 17:25.635
You know, some Hail Mary
chance at having a baby?

17:25.670 --> 17:27.670
It's just... it's just not worth it.

17:27.704 --> 17:30.566
So I think it's time that
we just both take a step back

17:30.584 --> 17:31.709
and agree that we...

17:31.751 --> 17:33.751
we just can't do this.

17:34.428 --> 17:35.852
Okay?

17:36.812 --> 17:38.497
I'm pregnant.

17:40.584 --> 17:43.335
- What?
- Yeah.

17:44.068 --> 17:45.470
Congratulations.

17:46.012 --> 17:48.112
- Be right back.
- Oh.

17:52.250 --> 17:53.500
You okay?

17:56.399 --> 17:58.499
Never been better.

17:58.532 --> 18:00.189
Then why are you crying?

18:00.209 --> 18:00.960
I mean,

18:00.994 --> 18:03.094
I put you in this situation...

18:04.174 --> 18:07.423
you may not even want to
be in anymore, you know?

18:07.542 --> 18:09.501
Todd...

18:11.417 --> 18:13.584
I knew what I was signing up for.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.435
Yeah, you thought you
did, and then I went nuts.

18:15.459 --> 18:17.418
You did. You definitely did.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.148
But I know who you are.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.734
You're a kind and wonderful man

18:23.770 --> 18:26.604
that got a little bit off track.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.739
Don't worry, I'll get you back

18:28.792 --> 18:30.751
in the second and third trimesters.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.001
I guess we're doing this, huh?
