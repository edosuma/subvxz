01:51.545 --> 01:55.147
[woman] Morning, bug.
You ready?

01:55.149 --> 01:56.515
Let's get this show on the road.

02:00.454 --> 02:04.189
-Give me a couple minutes, Mom?
-Not today.
You got early therapy.

02:04.191 --> 02:07.392
-[man sighs]
-Alrighty, here we go.

02:09.663 --> 02:13.298
That's one, two, buckle my bug.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.135
[Mom]
And I don't know how many times
we can go through recycling.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.636
You gotta break down your boxes.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.139
You have to break down
your boxes, you know?

02:20.141 --> 02:21.640
And also, the recycling,
it's ridiculous.

02:21.642 --> 02:25.210
-Can you go around
just for today?
-I gotta get you clean.

02:25.212 --> 02:27.913
-It's perfectly normal.
-You're right, Ma.

02:27.915 --> 02:31.216
Twenty-four years old,
you're washing my balls.
It's perfectly normal.

02:31.218 --> 02:33.619
It just seems very, very rude.
I mean, I don't know
how many times

02:33.621 --> 02:36.221
you can email
and text and call.

02:36.223 --> 02:38.207
You know, I just can't,
I can't go to everything.

02:38.208 --> 02:40.192
I actually don't like to go
to the public movie theaters

02:40.194 --> 02:43.362
because you don't know about
bedbugs and stuff like that.

02:43.364 --> 02:47.266
I don't have to listen
to any rude teenagers or people
talking to the screen.

02:47.268 --> 02:52.204
And you know how sometimes
when people say something funny
during the trailer,

02:52.206 --> 02:55.607
and then they start
really feeling their oats,
and they just keep it going,

02:55.609 --> 02:57.442
you know what I mean?
They should just quit
while they're ahead,

02:57.444 --> 03:00.779
but they just keep on yapping.
Careful.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.355
-[Mo] Hey.
-[bus driver] Hey, Mo.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.207
You have lovely hair.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.576
[man] Thanks, man.

03:37.284 --> 03:38.317
Ah!

03:38.319 --> 03:41.420
-Good morning, Mo.
-Hey, Sarah, how's it going?

03:41.422 --> 03:43.555
-Pretty good. How are you?
-Good.

03:43.557 --> 03:47.292
Uhm, hey, did you do
this new schedule?

03:47.294 --> 03:50.562
-I did.
-Oh, you accidentally put
the new guy with Becky.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.732
-Wasn't an accident.
-Mo, Scotty's going
to freak out.

03:53.734 --> 03:57.236
Yeah, well, he led me
into the ladies' room
at the movie theaters is why.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.471
No. Were there
other people in there?

03:59.473 --> 04:02.307
Not at first, but then I guess
some big movie let out,

04:02.309 --> 04:04.977
the women just kept on coming
and coming and coming,
so I just stayed in there.

04:04.979 --> 04:06.979
Then I guess
another movie let out.
It must have been 45 minutes.

04:06.981 --> 04:08.447
I went to the bathroom
two times.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.415
-This is revenge.
-Oh.

04:12.987 --> 04:14.753
-Hey, Scotty.
-Hi.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.521
Hey, is that Scotty?
What's up, buddy?

04:16.523 --> 04:19.258
-Who the hell's Matt?
-Mo did the schedule.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.627
Mo, you blind douche fuck!

04:21.629 --> 04:23.462
Is this about the ladies' room?
That was a joke.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.330
Uhm, this is funnier.

04:25.332 --> 04:28.800
Hey, I'm Matt Kwong.
I'm a new patient.

04:28.802 --> 04:32.671
[Sarah] Oh, welcome.
Just sign in right here.

04:32.673 --> 04:36.408
You're gonna
be with Becky in room one,
just right over there.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.543
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.483
Excuse me.

05:04.738 --> 05:05.737
Hi.

[man] Scotty. Morning.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.722
What's the matter?

05:24.625 --> 05:25.824
[man] Look alive, boys!

05:28.429 --> 05:31.596
-All right, asshole,
we're even.
-[Mo laughs]

05:32.633 --> 05:34.800
Uh, look at the bright side.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.602
At least with Renaldo,
you don't pitch
a tent during therapy.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.423
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

05:41.424 --> 05:43.441
When Becky was stretching
you out last week,
Ronnie walked by,

05:43.444 --> 05:46.111
-said you were sporting
a full-on panhandle.
-That cocksucker.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.113
[Scotty] Come on,
let's see what you got,
let's see what you got.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.716
-[Mo] Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about!
-[Scotty] Come on, Rick!

05:50.718 --> 05:52.351
Steal second.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.854
-Do you know
what you're saying?
-Nah, not really.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.724
-[laughs] Not at all.
-[Mo laughs]

06:01.462 --> 06:03.695
-Oh, you fucking kidding me?
-What's going on?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.464
-[Scotty] Oh, my God.
-[Mo] What?

06:05.466 --> 06:07.532
-[Scotty] I can't believe
this guy.
-Wait, where are you going?

06:07.534 --> 06:09.434
Hey, yo, Biceps.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.570
Just so we're clear,
there's a pecking order
around here.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.106
The very top, me.
Down at the very bottom, you.

06:14.108 --> 06:16.508
Becky's my physical therapist.
You get the hairy Spaniard.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.113
I don't make the schedule, guy.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.514
-Yo, yo, what are you doing?
-Say it! Becky's mine.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.583
-What is wrong with you, man?
-Say it.

06:24.585 --> 06:25.951
Yeah, yeah, Becky's yours.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.788
-Shit.
-That's a grandma chair,
by the way.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.923
You look fucking ridiculous
out here.
Get yourself a new chair.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.797
-[people cheering]
-[Mo] What's happening?
Here we go.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.668
[Mo] He gonna make it?

06:44.171 --> 06:46.805
[people cheering]

06:49.943 --> 06:51.643
-Great job.
-Thanks, baby.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.812
Yeah.

06:57.718 --> 06:58.917
[man] What are you looking at?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.687
Sorry, man. no offense.
Just...

07:03.791 --> 07:04.956
damn. Good for you.

07:07.895 --> 07:10.162
[sighs] You got it bad, huh?

07:10.164 --> 07:12.431
-For what?
-Blue balls.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.833
Shit, man, try fossilized.

07:15.636 --> 07:16.835
Yeah.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.537
I got something for you.

07:20.541 --> 07:21.840
Here, take this.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.182
What is this?

07:30.184 --> 07:32.184
The answer to your prayers.

07:32.186 --> 07:33.518
You'll thank me later.

07:34.455 --> 07:35.487
You will.

07:36.457 --> 07:37.522
All right.

07:55.476 --> 08:00.245
<i> Bonjour. My name is Philippe.</i>
<i> I am physically disabled.</i>

08:00.247 --> 08:04.549
<i> For many years, I struggled</i>
<i> with sexual encounters.</i>

08:04.551 --> 08:09.988
<i> It was really getting me down,</i>
<i> until I met a beautiful</i>
<i> professional like this one.</i>

08:09.990 --> 08:16.895
<i> And then I decided</i>
<i> to open my own brothel</i>
<i> to help people like you.</i>

08:17.664 --> 08:20.765
<i> Welcome to Le Chateau Paradis.</i>

08:20.767 --> 08:22.901
<i> Come as you are.</i>

08:24.538 --> 08:25.904
[knock on the door]

08:30.010 --> 08:33.712
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night, bug. I love you.

08:52.266 --> 08:54.266
[sighs] See you next week,
gorgeous.

08:54.268 --> 08:58.036
-Stay out of trouble, killer.
-Oh, don't you tell me
what to do.

08:58.739 --> 09:03.275
Yo, Biceps.
Hey, about last time, I'm sorry.
I was having an off day.

09:03.277 --> 09:04.876
Yeah, don't sweat it.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.045
-Matt, right?
-Yeah.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.981
I'm Scotty. Let me buy you
a beer to make up for it.

09:09.983 --> 09:13.785
-Nah, I got my mom with me.
-Yeah, me too.
We'll sit by ourselves.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.921
It's important. I wanna talk
to you about something.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.824
-You wanna-- move over.
-Yeah.

09:19.826 --> 09:20.992
-You go first.
-Yep.

09:20.994 --> 09:25.764
I was always
a straight-C student.
And that's a gentleman's C,

09:25.766 --> 09:29.034
that's a gentleman C,
I was always a terrible,
terrible student.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.570
Actually, on my SATs,
my math SAT...

09:33.674 --> 09:35.907
-Forget them, cheers.
-Cheers.

09:46.920 --> 09:51.356
Mm-hmm. Ah, that's nice.

09:51.358 --> 09:55.760
-So, what happened to you?
-Wow, you don't beat
around the bush.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.929
What's the point? You know
that's what everybody's
wondering anyway.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.864
It's nothing to be
ashamed of. It's usually
a pretty good story.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.333
I never said I was
ashamed of it.

10:01.335 --> 10:02.968
-Don't you wanna know
why I am in this chair?
-No.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.970
Congenital defect, baby.
I was born this way.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.606
-My joints are for shit.
-What did you wanna
talk to me about?

10:08.008 --> 10:09.140
Your sex life.

10:09.910 --> 10:10.942
Uh-huh.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.079
Come on, man.
What would you rather talk
about, interest rates?

10:14.081 --> 10:17.916
-You're a virgin, right?
-Uh-- Wow, just--

10:17.918 --> 10:21.019
That's a yes. Tell me
your junk still works 'cause
that would be a serious bummer.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.088
No, it works.
It's just a little--

10:23.090 --> 10:26.057
less predictable at times,
if you know what I mean.

10:26.960 --> 10:31.096
-Do I know what you mean?
-Bro, I live
what you mean. Sip.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.202
Oh.

10:41.041 --> 10:44.743
-What's it to you?
-Well, besides my mouth,

10:44.745 --> 10:47.812
about the only other thing
that works on my body
is my cock.

10:47.814 --> 10:51.750
And I may be a cripple,
but I can still feel everything
and I got motherfucking needs,

10:51.752 --> 10:52.884
you know what I mean?

10:55.922 --> 11:01.126
Anyway, what if I told you
there was a place for guys
like us to get seriously laid?

11:01.995 --> 11:04.396
Don't look at me
like I'm a perv.
We're in the same boat, dude.

11:04.398 --> 11:05.997
I'm just honest about it.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.899
Now the place is up in Montreal.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.201
I checked out the website,
LeChateauParadis.ca.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.803
'Cause you know, Canada.

11:12.406 --> 11:16.207
And let me tell you, man,
the chicks are spectacular.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.878
Why are you telling me all this?

11:21.848 --> 11:23.848
Me and this blind dude, Mo,
from the clinic, are gonna go,

11:23.850 --> 11:25.950
but we need one more guy
to split the cost of the van.

11:26.420 --> 11:27.852
What, you're gonna drive there?

11:29.756 --> 11:32.691
I priced the whole thing out
with a nurse driver.

11:32.693 --> 11:35.694
The van fits three passengers,
plus chairs and gear.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.129
We tell our parents
we're going up
to the Great Lakes or some shit,

11:38.131 --> 11:42.167
and instead we do a border run
for a few days of getting
our knobs polished

11:42.169 --> 11:44.936
by French-Canadian goddesses.
Sip.

11:49.776 --> 11:52.844
-So, what do you say?
Are you in or are you in?
-I'm definitely out.

11:54.114 --> 11:57.782
-Did you hear the part about
getting your knob polished?
-Mm-hmm.

11:57.784 --> 12:01.252
Thanks for the offer,
but as much as it
may surprise you,

12:03.190 --> 12:05.156
-I have a girlfriend.
-Seriously?

12:05.158 --> 12:06.725
Yeah. Good luck on your trip.

12:06.727 --> 12:10.795
-Take pictures.
-She hot?
Does she have cute friends?

12:10.797 --> 12:13.832
Wait, come on man,
we could double date.
Help a brother out.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.736
Shit.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.279
[girl laughing]

12:49.836 --> 12:52.137
So, you're gonna make
a wish when this falls off
or something?

12:52.139 --> 12:53.772
Wanna guess
what I'm gonna wish for?

12:53.774 --> 12:56.274
Uhm, that--

12:57.911 --> 12:59.144
[girl] Matt.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.214
-I thought you had a final.
-I got out early.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.020
Uh, this is Bobby.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.356
-We have Bio together.
-We were just studying.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.126
I-I didn't realize you, uh--

13:16.997 --> 13:18.062
Uhm--

13:21.268 --> 13:23.067
You didn't realize what?

13:24.037 --> 13:26.805
-Uh--
-That, uh--

13:27.307 --> 13:29.340
Uh, uh--

13:29.342 --> 13:33.344
Yeah, oh, you didn't realize
that she had a boyfriend.
That's what you're getting at.

13:33.346 --> 13:36.147
No, I mean, she talks
about you all the time.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.116
Oh.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.051
Is that right?

13:43.089 --> 13:46.124
I should get to class.
I'll call you later.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.059
For the exam, I mean.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.930
Sure, hope it's a speech class.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.835
-We were just studying.
-No, don't insult me.

13:57.571 --> 13:58.837
Please.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.439
You know, I gave you an out

14:01.441 --> 14:04.909
-when this all started.
-I didn't want out, Matt.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.211
I had options too, you know.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.881
But I waited for you.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.386
I have to start thinking
about my future.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.274
<i> Bonjour. My name is Philippe.</i>

14:43.083 --> 14:46.150
-Jamie, can't you knock?
-Mom says dinner
in five minutes.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.289
-Nice pictures by the way.
-Out.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.464
What do you guys think about...

15:00.901 --> 15:04.135
me going on a road trip
with some guys up north,

15:04.137 --> 15:05.470
maybe around the Great Lakes?

15:11.144 --> 15:14.312
Well, it seems
hardly like a good time, Matty,

15:15.649 --> 15:17.181
with everything
that's going on.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.117
Well, I mean, that's
exactly why I wanna go.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.351
It seems
like I'm doing nothing

15:20.353 --> 15:21.052
but going to doctors
and therapy.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.960
We're going up to Grandma's
for a long weekend next month.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.296
You could invite Jennifer.

15:31.932 --> 15:32.997
[sighs]

15:34.367 --> 15:37.435
I asked to go on a road trip
with some guys,

15:37.437 --> 15:41.272
and you counter
with a weekend at Grandma's.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.146
Well, we're gonna have to say
no on this one, Matty.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.481
I'm sorry.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.260
[pants]

16:40.333 --> 16:41.432
[grunts]

16:50.410 --> 16:53.177
[music playing]

16:54.748 --> 16:57.215
¶<i> Half man and half machine</i> ¶

16:57.217 --> 17:00.551
¶<i> Not talking about the chair</i>
<i> But what's in between</i>
<i> My legs</i> ¶

17:00.553 --> 17:03.221
¶<i> Girl, take your time</i>
<i> You don't need to be quick</i> ¶

17:03.223 --> 17:05.523
¶<i> Come and get your some</i>
<i> Of this quadriplegic</i> ¶

17:05.525 --> 17:07.525
-What the fuck?
-You have a visitor.

17:12.032 --> 17:13.097
What's up?

17:17.237 --> 17:18.469
I like these ferns.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.639
Yeah, they're, uh--

17:21.641 --> 17:27.111
-Yeah, they're, you know.
-Listen, I've been thinking
about your idea.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.447
My parents say it's a no-go.

17:35.121 --> 17:38.790
Now that our moms talk,
if we were to do this,

17:38.792 --> 17:42.427
-it has to be totally
black ops, you follow?
-I think so, yeah.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.228
It means your mom
can't help you pack,

17:44.831 --> 17:46.230
she can't help you pay for it.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.232
Okay, might need
a cheaper driver.

17:48.802 --> 17:50.568
I've been saving up some money
for an iPad comm system,

17:50.570 --> 17:52.403
but fucking honeys
come first.

17:53.540 --> 17:56.140
I say we go sooner,
like next week.

17:57.077 --> 17:59.410
Whoa. Why the rush?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.145
You-- you never know.

18:01.147 --> 18:04.816
I mean, if we're gonna do this,
let's do it.

18:04.818 --> 18:06.451
Okay.
What about your girlfriend?

18:08.822 --> 18:11.355
Just get Mo over here.
Let's start planning.

18:11.858 --> 18:14.158
-Mo?
-Yeah, Mo.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.160
Your friend Mo.
You said he was down, right?

18:16.162 --> 18:18.296
Mo, yeah, yeah, yeah,
no, he's down.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.597
He's probably most likely down.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.500
He's probably most likely down.
What do you mean?

18:23.636 --> 18:25.403
I haven't exactly asked him yet.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.306
-You haven't asked him yet?!
-Shh! Keep it down.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.408
I was worried if there were
too many variables,
you'd say no.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.143
Then if you said yes,
I'd have time to work on Mo.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.995
Now all of a sudden,
you're in a big fucking hurry,

18:33.996 --> 18:35.846
and I don't have
everything worked out just yet.
But it's fine.

18:35.849 --> 18:39.283
I'll get Mo on the horn,
just convince him to go.

18:39.853 --> 18:42.720
-[sighs]
-Hey, look at me, trust
me. I can handle Mo.

18:44.858 --> 18:49.193
[whispering]
A brothel in Quebec?
What are you-- no way!

18:49.195 --> 18:51.295
Could you take your tampon out
for half a goddamn minute

18:51.297 --> 18:52.947
while we tell you the details
at least?

18:52.948 --> 18:54.598
Let me tell you
a little something
about Canada.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.567
Fact: The Canadian government
has been cracking down

18:56.569 --> 18:59.270
on erotic massage parlors
since 2014.

18:59.272 --> 19:02.406
Fact: Arrested sex workers
have tripled
in the last two years.

19:02.408 --> 19:06.344
Fact: It's only illegal
to buy sexual services.
You can still make donations.

19:06.346 --> 19:09.480
I looked this up too.
And fact: When's the last
time you got laid, Mo?

19:09.482 --> 19:12.216
-Oh, that's right, never.
-Oh, well unlike you Scotty,

19:12.218 --> 19:15.887
that's not all I ever think
about. What I do think
about is logistics.

19:15.889 --> 19:18.356
Do you know this would take
months, months of planning?

19:18.358 --> 19:21.425
-Of course, you don't know that.
-Me and Biceps have planned
the whole route.

19:21.427 --> 19:24.195
-I fucking hate that name.
-We got hotel rooms booked
at every stop.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.531
-What? No!
-We budgeted all the meals.
Why are you undermining me?

19:26.533 --> 19:28.633
You are making us look
fucking weak right now.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.668
-Shut the fuck up!
-Look, Mo, Mo, look, listen.

19:30.670 --> 19:34.906
Part of the fun is that this
is spontaneous, okay?

19:34.908 --> 19:38.176
When's the last time you
did something kind of crazy?

19:38.611 --> 19:42.280
Yeah, look, here's the thing.
I don't do spontaneous things.
That's not my thing.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.514
I don't even know
why you need me.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.551
The van fits three,
but only two wheelchairs,

19:46.553 --> 19:48.619
and I don't happen to know
any other disabled virgins

19:48.621 --> 19:50.321
with working legs
and enough cash.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.357
You know what?
Nice meeting you, Muscles.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.627
-Go fuck yourself, Scotty.
-Wow.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.664
-You are horrible at this.
-No, no, you know what?

19:59.666 --> 20:01.599
You're a fucking mule.
You're so stubborn.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.668
You gotta know when you lost
somebody. He's out.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.536
I'll put an ad out
on Craigslist
or something.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.972
-Let's go.
-Yeah, do a Craigslist ad.

20:07.974 --> 20:11.375
-Virgins looking
for more virgins.
-I don't even want you to come.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.744
-We're gonna have a great time.
Go fuck yourself.
-Great sales pitch,

20:13.746 --> 20:15.513
and then now
you're getting on Craigslist.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.415
Mo, Mo, let me talk
to you for a second.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.951
It's like he went
to business school.
Guy just knows what he's doing.

20:19.953 --> 20:24.422
-Fucking prick.
-First of all,
my sincerest apologies.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.425
How you are friends
with that guy
is totally beyond me.

20:27.427 --> 20:30.561
Okay, look, all that stuff
about the brothel,
about the getting laid,

20:30.563 --> 20:32.530
all that stuff,
that's Scotty, okay?

20:32.532 --> 20:34.365
That's not me.
What I'm proposing--

20:35.235 --> 20:39.270
What we're proposing is a trip
away from Littleton.

20:39.706 --> 20:43.741
Okay? With just us guys,
away from parents,
from the clinics, from the doc--

20:46.646 --> 20:48.512
It's just, I don't know
about you,

20:49.716 --> 20:50.781
okay, but I--

20:53.386 --> 20:54.652
I need to get out.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.295
I could use a field trip.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.665
It's like a--

21:08.635 --> 21:09.734
It's like a road trip.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.539
Promise you won't do
anything illegal?

21:17.744 --> 21:19.277
Did I get to him?

21:19.612 --> 21:21.345
[door opening]

21:22.015 --> 21:25.349
Damn it, Jamie. How many times
do I have to tell you?

21:27.487 --> 21:28.552
Hey, hey.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.596
What's wrong?

21:38.597 --> 21:39.563
I don't wanna fight
with you anymore.

21:45.338 --> 21:46.570
Hey, can I ask you something?

21:48.574 --> 21:49.707
It's gotta be a secret though.

21:51.344 --> 21:52.443
You can't tell Mom and Dad.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.893
[grunts] Fuck.

22:16.102 --> 22:17.868
Yo, sent you the itinerary.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.571
Print it out, read
the file, leave no trace.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.606
Found us a cheaper driver.
His name is Sam.

22:22.608 --> 22:24.875
Van looks like shit,
but the price is right.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.644
Make sure he
has a valid passport.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.512
We don't wanna any snafus
at the border.

22:30.817 --> 22:31.849
What's a snafu?

22:31.851 --> 22:34.969
-What about this one?
-Are you kidding? That's ugly.

22:34.970 --> 22:38.088
What does that--
Jamaica. It says Jamaica. What
am I gonna do with Jamaica?

22:38.091 --> 22:41.892
-I can't read your fucking
shirt, Scotty.
-That's true. Put it in the bag.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.834
[phone ringing]

22:52.438 --> 22:55.506
-Yup.
-Operation Copulation is a go.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.776
We're not calling it that.
See you at six.

23:00.580 --> 23:03.581
I know it seems silly,
but I'd like to think
I'm watching it in a wry eye,

23:03.583 --> 23:06.617
with an ironic eye,
not earnestly.

23:06.619 --> 23:09.887
Here, not earnestly watch.
I'm so sorry. Here.

23:11.457 --> 23:15.659
Oh, he did not give her a rose.
You gotta be shitting me.

23:18.131 --> 23:20.531
Goddamn it, Mom!
How hard is it
to aim for my mouth?

23:20.533 --> 23:24.902
I'm sorry! But did you
see who he kept?
Total bitch, total bitch.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.905
I'm sorry! I'm just compelled
to watch shows I hate.

23:27.907 --> 23:32.510
-I'll eat tomorrow, I guess.
-Come back. Come on.

23:43.790 --> 23:47.425
-[knock on the door]
-Hey, bug, you can't sleep
in your chair.

23:47.894 --> 23:48.959
Leave me alone.

24:06.779 --> 24:11.582
-Set alarm for five a.m.
-[phone]<i> Sorry,</i>
<i> I'm not sure I understand.</i>

24:12.518 --> 24:18.989
-Set alarm for five a.m.
<i> -I set an alarm for five a.m.</i>

24:25.932 --> 24:26.997
Okay.

24:30.536 --> 24:31.602
Light off.

24:37.643 --> 24:40.878
[alarm beeping]

24:44.517 --> 24:47.017
[grunts]

24:57.730 --> 25:00.764
-Seriously?
-To remind you of me.

25:03.769 --> 25:04.835
Fuck.

25:26.526 --> 25:28.792
-Matt?
-Yeah. Where's--
where's Scotty?

25:28.794 --> 25:30.661
I don't know, man. He's late.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.630
This is a horrible idea.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.899
He's not reliable.
I'll tell you that much.

25:34.901 --> 25:38.769
You think it ends here?
Big shocker, huh?

25:38.771 --> 25:40.738
I'm worried. If he's gonna
be tardy all over the place,

25:40.740 --> 25:41.839
-it's probably messed--
-Shit.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.073
What?

25:45.578 --> 25:47.811
I guess Sam's a woman?

25:49.282 --> 25:51.282
-[Mo] Sam the driver?
-[Matt] Sam the driver
is a woman.

25:51.284 --> 25:53.751
We can't do this with a woman.
I'm not going to a brothel
with a woman.

25:53.753 --> 25:54.852
Well, it's too late to cancel.

25:54.854 --> 25:58.889
[Mo] I can't do this
with a woman. I can't go
to a brothel with a woman.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.942
You know what?
Everything's messed up here.

26:01.943 --> 26:04.994
-Scotty's not here,
we got a woman for a driver--
-Shh. Hi, Sam.

26:05.798 --> 26:08.599
-Hey, is that Sam? Hey.
-Thank you.

26:08.601 --> 26:11.769
Looking forward
to our trip together.
I'm Mo, this--

26:13.839 --> 26:15.839
-She's friendly.
-Yeah, she's chill.

26:15.841 --> 26:17.875
-Yeah, all the signs
are real positive.
-Yeah, let's go, let's go.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.944
-Yeah, we're off
to a great start.
-Hey, Sam?

26:19.946 --> 26:22.713
[Matt]
We need one extra stop, please.

26:31.357 --> 26:32.590
Fuck!

26:39.098 --> 26:41.198
[grunts]

26:44.937 --> 26:50.207
Come on. Come on. Come on!

26:51.344 --> 26:53.143
[Matt] Right here on the right.
Just pull up to the curb.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.133
[Mo] I told him
to set two alarms.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.102
He's got no respect
for other people's time.

27:18.104 --> 27:21.071
I told him we're on a schedule.
Do not be late. Be early.

27:38.391 --> 27:40.680
Fuck!

27:40.681 --> 27:42.970
It was his plan.
But he doesn't care.
He doesn't have respect.

27:42.971 --> 27:45.260
-Yo, if he chickened out,
we have to pay for it.
-I'm not paying for it.

27:46.866 --> 27:47.931
There he is.

27:58.978 --> 28:02.046
-[Mo] Where have you been?
-Grab my pouch, on the ground.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.748
Who the hell are you? Matt.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.684
-Yeah, just get in.
-Who the hell is she?

28:06.686 --> 28:09.019
-[Mo] I told you
to set two alarms.
-I thought we had a guy driver.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.155
-I told you we're
on a tight schedule.
-You're ramming me.

28:11.157 --> 28:14.191
-I'm not ramming you. Get back.
-[Mo] You have no respect
for anyone else's time.

28:14.193 --> 28:17.795
-Shut up! I had a thing.
-[Mo] You're the most unreliable
person I've ever met in my life.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.229
-[Matt] What's with you ramming
into me all the time?
-[Scotty] Just move back.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.965
[Matt] Just hold on.
I'm just gonna walk.

28:21.967 --> 28:23.767
Whoo! [laughs]

28:25.771 --> 28:27.204
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

28:31.477 --> 28:33.911
-Road trip!
-Field trip!

28:33.913 --> 28:36.113
Road trip! Road trip.

28:41.987 --> 28:43.320
Scotty.

28:54.800 --> 28:58.769
[phone ringing]

29:00.873 --> 29:03.774
-Ah, shit, it's my parents.
-What?

29:03.776 --> 29:05.943
-It's my parents.
-Take mine out, will you?

29:05.945 --> 29:07.111
-Wait, what happened?
-Where is it?

29:07.113 --> 29:08.278
It's in the pouch.

29:11.217 --> 29:15.219
-Dude, it's your mom too.
-Shit. Toss it.

29:15.221 --> 29:17.855
-What?
-Seriously, toss it out
the window. They can track us.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.256
It's the cost of freedom.
Do it.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.229
-Mo, you too.
-Did he just throw
his phone out?

29:25.231 --> 29:26.964
-[Scotty] Mo, do it!
-I'm not throwing my phone out!

29:26.966 --> 29:29.367
-[Matt] Mo, throw it.
-[Scotty] Mo, throw
your phone out!

29:29.368 --> 29:31.769
-My mom knows you.
She knows your mom.
-It's a brand-new phone, man!

29:31.771 --> 29:33.170
-You know-- Fine!
-[Scotty] Do it!

29:36.542 --> 29:38.075
What was that?

29:38.077 --> 29:39.977
It's my sim card.
I threw out my sim card.

29:39.979 --> 29:41.845
-Fuck, that's a better idea.
-[Mo] So stupid.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.353
-Okay.
-What's happening?
Why are we stopping?

29:52.258 --> 29:54.358
-Hey.
-What the fuck is going on here?

29:56.162 --> 29:58.128
We're taking a trip.
The rest is none
of your business.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.330
-Who is this chick, dude?
-None of my business?

30:00.332 --> 30:05.536
You know what? It actually is
my business if you're
not supposed to go.

30:05.538 --> 30:07.672
Hey, we're all adults
here, sweetheart.

30:07.673 --> 30:09.807
What, just because I'm
in a chair means I can't make
a decision for myself?

30:09.809 --> 30:12.910
-I'm sorry.
Who the fuck is sweetheart?
-Scotty.

30:12.912 --> 30:14.344
No, no, no. I wanna hear
what she has to say.

30:14.346 --> 30:16.597
Go on, sweetheart,
what are you gonna say?

30:16.598 --> 30:18.849
Okay, great, so I'm sweetheart.
Let me tell you something, okay?

30:18.851 --> 30:22.152
You call me sweetheart one
more time, I'm gonna bust
you in your fucking face.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.121
And I don't give a shit
about your bitch-ass chair.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.091
Huh? Huh?

30:29.595 --> 30:32.996
All right, no, that's cool
because I'm gonna refund
half of y'all goddamn money

30:32.998 --> 30:35.188
because I don't need none
of this bullshit.

30:35.189 --> 30:37.379
I'm gonna drop
y'all back and go about
my goddamn business.

30:37.380 --> 30:39.570
[Mo] No, no, Sam, Sam,
I'm sorry. Please,
just listen to me for a second.

30:39.572 --> 30:41.905
I'm so sorry about Scotty.
Forget him, okay?

30:41.907 --> 30:43.974
Look, how about this?

30:43.976 --> 30:46.343
How about to make up for the
stress of this departure,

30:46.345 --> 30:49.847
we give you
a little extra money,

30:49.849 --> 30:52.916
as long as you agree
to maybe keep moving forward?

30:53.352 --> 30:54.852
And why the secrecy?

30:56.222 --> 30:57.287
Look.

30:57.289 --> 31:00.224
Our parents are very
good people, but...

31:01.927 --> 31:03.060
You know, they don't really--

31:03.863 --> 31:05.863
They can be
a little overbearing.

31:06.298 --> 31:09.116
I'm thirty-five years old, Sam.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.935
I've never been on a trip
without my mom,
much less a real field trip.

31:12.605 --> 31:15.172
And honestly, if it was up
to my mom, I don't know
that I ever would.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.008
Please, I need this, Sam.

31:19.245 --> 31:22.145
Am I gonna get any more bullshit
from sweetheart back there?

31:23.215 --> 31:25.115
-Oh, I'm sweetheart now?
-Yes.

31:25.117 --> 31:28.051
-So, sweetheart,
you gonna be a problem?
-Scotty.

31:30.623 --> 31:33.423
-I'm good.
-Fucking better be.

31:35.294 --> 31:38.095
Jamie, pumpkin,
this is not a joke.

31:38.097 --> 31:40.931
Your brother's in no condition
to be traveling.
Now where did they go?

31:41.267 --> 31:44.234
-I'll take your bike
away for a month.
-Honey, please answer us.

31:44.236 --> 31:47.671
-And your American Girl dolls.
-Matty may need our help
right now, sweetie.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.907
-And your phone.
-What?

31:50.643 --> 31:54.678
Okay, fine.
They went up north.
That's all I know.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.447
[phone ringing]

31:58.250 --> 32:00.984
-Hello?
-Roger, it's Liz.

32:00.986 --> 32:02.653
I know where they're
staying tonight.

32:02.655 --> 32:05.989
¶<i> I stepped in this bitch</i>

32:05.991 --> 32:08.692

¶<i> Motherfuck the whole earth</i>

32:26.045 --> 32:27.311
[Sam] All right, guys.

32:30.149 --> 32:33.216
All right, who's paying?

32:37.056 --> 32:38.121
I'll get this one.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.260
Thank you.

32:43.262 --> 32:47.331
Don't buy any food
because packed sandwiches
for lunch.

32:47.333 --> 32:50.000
Okay, but I'm gonna buy
some vacation candy.
Do you want some?

32:50.002 --> 32:54.004
I can't do sweets, but have
them put forty on pump three.

32:54.006 --> 32:56.106
All right, it's your vacation.

32:56.108 --> 32:59.109
Hey, yo, Mo, you going in?
Score me a nudie mag, dude.

32:59.445 --> 33:01.445
What? No, no.

33:01.447 --> 33:04.448
-Goddamn it, Mo!
-No, man, I wouldn't even know
which one it is, okay?

33:04.450 --> 33:06.316
Top shelf on the magazine rack,
covered in plastic.

33:06.318 --> 33:09.219
-I'm not picky.
Grab whichever one you want.
-[sighs]

33:35.314 --> 33:36.346
[Mo] What's up?

33:36.348 --> 33:38.237
[Scotty keeps singing]

33:38.238 --> 33:40.127
¶<i> Now I don't need</i>

34:04.176 --> 34:06.643
I need you to stop. Forever.

34:11.784 --> 34:15.352
Mo, you fucking moron.
A bridal magazine?

34:15.354 --> 34:18.355
-It's a bridal magazine?
-What the hell am I supposed
to do with a--

34:20.426 --> 34:23.126
Actually, I can make this work.

34:29.134 --> 34:32.602
You guys, go get
yourselves some dinner.
I'm gonna check us in.

34:32.604 --> 34:34.638
But first I'm gonna
need my per diem.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.140
I got gas.

34:37.142 --> 34:40.510
-[Scotty] I got it. In my pouch.
-Okay.

34:42.581 --> 34:46.516
Now we agreed on 50,

34:47.386 --> 34:50.854
but we also agreed
that I would be getting extra

34:50.856 --> 34:54.091
for dealing
with all that bullshit
I dealt with earlier.

34:55.260 --> 34:58.228
Great. I will take the hundred.

34:59.131 --> 35:00.297
Put it right in the bank.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.266
Have a nice dinner.

35:04.503 --> 35:07.237
I really believe
I would be just as much a virgin

35:07.239 --> 35:09.840
-even if I could see perfectly.
-No, I hundred percent
agree with you.

35:09.842 --> 35:12.109
20/20 vision,
I'd still have zero sex.

35:12.111 --> 35:13.877
You know what? A toast.
Can we make a toast right now?

35:13.879 --> 35:16.313
-Yes, we can.
-It's just who I am.

35:16.315 --> 35:19.282
-Hey, I'm making a toast.
-We're making a toast.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.118
We're making a toast. Drinks up.

35:23.322 --> 35:24.387
To our road trip.

35:25.124 --> 35:28.525
No, no, no, our--
To our pilgrimage.

35:29.595 --> 35:33.330
And to the bevy
of beauties awaiting us
at Le Chateau Paradis.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.365
Or paradise in French, right?

35:35.367 --> 35:38.401
-It means heaven.
-It's heaven. It means heaven.

35:38.403 --> 35:40.537
-What does?
-Paradis, heaven.

35:40.539 --> 35:43.273
Whatever, man. Mo, it's
my toast, and I'm saying--

35:43.275 --> 35:44.608
-It's an inaccurate toast.
-For the sake of this--
you know what?

35:44.610 --> 35:45.909
I wish you were mute
instead of blind.

35:45.911 --> 35:48.345
Guys, guys, guys,
come on, come on. Come on now.

35:48.347 --> 35:51.314
-Okay, okay,
but most importantly--
-Yeah.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.549
to our boners.

35:53.218 --> 35:54.684
Scotty, shh.

35:55.354 --> 35:57.554
I'm having a moment.
Can I have it?

35:57.556 --> 35:59.222
You guys never
let me have a moment.

35:59.224 --> 36:00.590
You're always interrupting
me and cutting me off.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.626
You can have your moment.
You can have your moment.

36:02.628 --> 36:04.261
Can we just drink
the fucking beer, man?

36:04.263 --> 36:05.428
-Indoor voice, man.
-Okay, fine, indoor.

36:05.430 --> 36:08.298
Shh, okay, okay, okay.
All right, quiet.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.699
To our boners!

36:09.701 --> 36:16.306
For though our sight
may have faltered,
our legs given out,

36:16.308 --> 36:18.642
our joints railed against us,

36:19.678 --> 36:24.214
our cocks stand strong
and ready to serve us

36:24.216 --> 36:26.483
-in the pursuit
of life and liberty--
-Let's wrap it up.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.753
and the chase of the
inevitable hoo-hoo,

36:31.390 --> 36:32.722
the ineffable hoo-hoo,

36:32.724 --> 36:37.627
to old one-eye,
may he stand tall-- go ahead,
get ready to cheer.

36:37.629 --> 36:40.664
may he stand tall--
I'm almost done--
and do us proud.

36:41.567 --> 36:44.334
-Huh? Yeah.
-We're sorry.

36:45.237 --> 36:47.237
We're not sorry.

36:47.238 --> 36:49.238
-I'm so glad I can't see this.
-None of us is sorry.
Eat your food.

36:49.241 --> 36:52.709
Okay. What do you
wanna sleep in?

36:52.711 --> 36:55.212
Oh, I free-ball.
I like letting my boys breathe.

36:57.950 --> 37:00.417
-Got sweats in my bag.
-Sweats in your bag, okay.

37:00.686 --> 37:03.553
-Hey, quick game
before lights out?
-Yeah, sure.

37:06.425 --> 37:12.262
-You okay?
-Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
I just got a little bit dizzy.

37:12.264 --> 37:14.798
Happens when I drop chaff
for the ladies.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.270
-Sam?
-What?

37:20.272 --> 37:22.305
Sam? Holy shit! Sam!

37:22.307 --> 37:23.640
-[Matt] What's going on?
-Sam!

37:23.641 --> 37:24.974
-Check her pulse. Is she dead?
-[Mo] What's happening?

37:24.977 --> 37:27.510
-Sam. Shit.
-No, she just passed out.

37:27.512 --> 37:29.312
Mo, call 911, call 911.

37:29.314 --> 37:32.682
Uh, well, don't just sit there.
Give her CPR or something!

37:32.684 --> 37:35.352
You don't give CPR to someone
who's breathing, dipshit.

37:35.354 --> 37:36.886
-I don't know!
-Mo, Mo, I'll handle it.
Just help her out.

37:42.394 --> 37:45.462
-[Scotty] Easy, watch her head,
watch her head.
-Oh fuck! She's--

37:45.464 --> 37:46.730
[Mo] Sam.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.034
Those are her tits!
What are you doing?

37:51.036 --> 37:52.435
You told me to help,
I'm trying to help!

37:52.437 --> 37:54.921
Well, don't cop a feel! Jesus!

37:54.922 --> 37:57.406
Hi. Um, uh, I need an ambulance
in room 103, please.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.709
-Now you're smothering her.
-Shut the fuck up.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.012
-[Mo] Her heart's racing.
-That's probably you.

38:02.014 --> 38:04.314
[siren wails]

38:04.316 --> 38:07.384
[doctor] She has
acute hypoglycemia.
She's diabetic.

38:07.386 --> 38:09.653
She'll be fine, but we're gonna
take her in as a precaution.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.288
You guys okay without her?

38:14.359 --> 38:18.795
Yeah. Yeah, we'll be okay.
Um, when will she be back?

38:18.797 --> 38:22.299
We'll probably keep
her overnight.
She'll be back in the morning.

38:23.669 --> 38:24.734
Thank you.

38:30.509 --> 38:34.577
-[sighs]
-[siren wails]

38:35.447 --> 38:38.548
Relax, it's over.
Everyone lived.

38:39.518 --> 38:41.451
What if she's not okay, man?
What if she doesn't come back?

38:41.453 --> 38:43.853
We're not stranded
in the wilderness.
We're in a two-star motel.

38:43.855 --> 38:46.790
I guarantee you they have
porn on these TVs.

38:46.792 --> 38:50.060
We can take care of each
other for one night,
help each other out, yeah?

38:50.062 --> 38:53.396
Yes! Unlimited adult
content, 12.99.

38:53.398 --> 38:54.965
Don't waste our money
on that, please.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.533
-[Mo] I'm not watching
that with you.
-God, I wish I could jerk off.

38:56.535 --> 38:59.602
-You have no idea
how lucky you are.
-Ah, shit!

39:00.706 --> 39:02.372
Sam has the room keys.

39:04.343 --> 39:05.875
I have these car keys though.
That's useful.

39:07.412 --> 39:09.779
-I'm gonna go down to the lobby.
-[Scotty] I'm ordering the porn!

39:12.484 --> 39:13.550
Mo, grab the remote.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.887
Mo? Hey, Mo, you know
what'll make you feel better?

39:18.724 --> 39:20.623
Unlimited adult content, 12.99.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.760
Mo, are you crying?

39:25.397 --> 39:27.364
Scotty. [clears throat]

39:27.833 --> 39:29.466
I'm gonna take that remote,

39:30.502 --> 39:31.901
and I'm gonna beat
your dick with it.

39:33.605 --> 39:34.637
Here you go.

39:34.639 --> 39:38.842
And don't forget to fill out
that survey that we sent you

39:38.844 --> 39:40.510
with the email confirmation.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.479
You can get a free TV dinner

39:42.481 --> 39:43.646
from the vending machine.

39:44.149 --> 39:45.849
-Okay, thanks.
-No problem.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.621
Hey, when did you
send the email?

39:51.623 --> 39:53.857
Uh, you should have got
it this morning.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.959
We just sent it
to the email we had on file.

39:57.562 --> 39:58.895
What's the squishy sound?

39:58.897 --> 40:01.664
It's lube mixed with pu--

40:01.666 --> 40:03.566
She brought lube?

40:03.568 --> 40:06.603
Scotty, does your mom have
access to your email?

40:06.605 --> 40:08.405
Yeah, but I deleted everything.
Scorched earth.

40:08.407 --> 40:10.607
Hey, check this out.
We're watching Anal Therapy III.

40:10.609 --> 40:13.743
This place, they sent you
an email confirmation
this morning.

40:13.745 --> 40:16.613
[sex sound]

40:16.615 --> 40:18.415
Shit, my mom
will definitely check.

40:18.417 --> 40:20.667
Littleton is nine
hours from here.

40:20.668 --> 40:22.918
If they received the email
this morning, that means
right now, they'd be around...

40:25.157 --> 40:27.991
-Shit.
-This is real bad. We gotta go.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.094
We gotta go right now.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.429
We're five minutes away.
Yeah, Liz, next right,
next right.

40:33.899 --> 40:36.666
Okay, well, I'll call
you from there, okay?
When we get there.

40:37.436 --> 40:38.601
I'll see if we can get us a cab.

40:38.603 --> 40:39.869
My chair can't fit in a cab,
come on!

40:39.871 --> 40:41.471
-Where are we going?
-To the van.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.773
Scotty. Hey, not to nitpick,

40:43.775 --> 40:45.575
but what are we gonna do
when we get to the van?

40:48.613 --> 40:49.746
All right.

40:49.748 --> 40:52.215
You guys realize
I'm blind, right?

40:52.217 --> 40:54.884
-Yeah, just find
the brake. I got this.
-Okay, okay, what do I do?

40:54.886 --> 40:56.920
-On the floor, Mo.
-Mo, on the floor.

40:56.922 --> 40:58.788
I was just getting another--

40:58.790 --> 41:01.491
-Okay. Your right foot
on the left pedal.
-Right, of course, right.

41:01.493 --> 41:02.692
-Right foot.
-No, I got it, right.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.961
You got it? Okay.
This is a terrible idea.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.797
-You got a better one?
-Please don't make me
drive, guys, please.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.999
Mo, it's okay.
Okay, so right foot on
left pedal, right?

41:10.001 --> 41:13.870
That's home base,
so whenever I say go home,
that's your home base.

41:13.872 --> 41:16.973
-Go home, got it. Okay?
-Whenever in doubt, go home.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.509
-Go home.
-[Matt] Okay?

41:19.511 --> 41:21.644
-Bogey at 10 o'clock.
-Mo, Mo, we gotta go.

41:21.646 --> 41:24.013
You can do this, okay?
Scotty, give him
some fucking encouragement.

41:24.015 --> 41:25.882
-Don't fucking kill us, Mo.
-[Matt] Scotty!

41:25.884 --> 41:27.016
Sorry, sorry.

41:27.018 --> 41:28.985
You're gonna be great, Mo.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.820
Just, you know, most people
drive like they're blind anyway,

41:30.822 --> 41:32.555
so you got this in the bag.

41:32.557 --> 41:34.691
Okay, Mo, I'm gonna put
the car into gear,

41:34.693 --> 41:42.732
and on my signal, I want you
to slowly take your right foot
off the brake, on my signal.

41:42.734 --> 41:44.567
-Okay.
-Okay?

41:44.569 --> 41:47.904
Now slowly take your right foot
off the brake now.

41:50.575 --> 41:53.276
You're doing great.
A little more, a little more.

41:53.278 --> 41:57.680
-The brake, the brake,
pull the brake!
-[Mo] Fuck!

41:58.817 --> 42:00.233
What happened?

42:00.234 --> 42:01.650
-What do you mean,
what happened?
-What'd I hit?

42:01.653 --> 42:03.820
-It's okay.
-[Mo] Fuck!

42:03.821 --> 42:05.988
-All right, guys,
it's now or never.
-[Mo] No, never.

42:05.991 --> 42:07.056
Mo?

42:09.961 --> 42:11.094
Give it some gas.

42:13.598 --> 42:17.901
They say that there's
like something going on
where their bed is making noise

42:17.903 --> 42:21.738
when they're not on the bed,
and so it sounds like they're
concerned

42:21.740 --> 42:25.108
about if there's some kind
of paranormal activity
or something like--

42:25.944 --> 42:30.580
What the guy said happened was--
Totally, one second,
totally, totally.

42:30.582 --> 42:34.784
That he was sitting
on the toilet, and he saw
the sheets and the blanket

42:34.786 --> 42:38.721
fly off the bed
of their own volition
or whatever.

42:38.723 --> 42:43.293
Look, are you able
to come down and talk
to them because if I tell him

42:43.295 --> 42:46.963
that that didn't happen,
I feel like I'm saying
that there's like something

42:46.965 --> 42:49.666
going on with his room that--

42:49.668 --> 42:54.604
I don't know if this guy
has a past in some way.
Do you know what I mean by that?

42:54.606 --> 42:55.872
-This is gonna work.
-Okay, I'm fucking driving.

42:55.874 --> 42:56.940
-You got this.
-Okay.

42:56.942 --> 42:58.708
-You got this!
-Shh!

42:59.044 --> 43:01.644
All right, Mo, you're coming
up at a light, okay?

43:01.646 --> 43:03.079
I need you to hit easy brake.

43:03.081 --> 43:05.715
-Easy brake, a little bit more.
-Harder.

43:05.717 --> 43:09.719
-Mo, a little harder.
-Mo, Mo. Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo--

43:09.721 --> 43:12.622
-[Matt] Stop!
-[screaming]

43:12.624 --> 43:14.240
[driver] What are you, blind?

43:14.241 --> 43:15.857
[Scotty] This may be the worst
idea I've ever had.

43:15.860 --> 43:19.095
Mo, when I tell you to stop,
I really need you to stop, okay?

43:19.097 --> 43:21.965
When I fucking tell you,
I can't drive a fucking van,
I can't drive a fucking van!

43:21.967 --> 43:23.967
-Okay, guys,
let's just chill out.
-We're gonna go to jail.

43:23.969 --> 43:26.102
[Scotty] We're not going
to jail. Just chill out.

43:27.038 --> 43:29.839
All right, listen.
Hang a right,
pull onto the highway.

43:29.841 --> 43:31.608
We gotta find somewhere
else to crash.

43:31.610 --> 43:32.775
-[Matt] Mo. Mo.
The fucking highway!

43:33.144 --> 43:36.179
Management! Open up!
[knocks on the door]

43:37.048 --> 43:40.216
[sex sound]

43:44.856 --> 43:45.888
No, they're not here.

43:46.891 --> 43:48.124
All their stuff is gone.

43:49.361 --> 43:50.727
What?

43:50.729 --> 43:53.162
No, no.
That's just the neighbors.

43:55.100 --> 43:57.968
How do you...

43:57.969 --> 44:00.837
Looks like they got
the unlimited adult
content package.

44:00.839 --> 44:02.071
I'll have to call you back.

44:03.708 --> 44:05.174
[sex sound]

44:10.415 --> 44:11.814
So many channels.

44:13.184 --> 44:14.751
[Scotty] Can someone
flip on my light?

44:15.387 --> 44:16.853
Kind of busy here, dude.

44:17.155 --> 44:19.856
I can't navigate if I can't see.

44:20.392 --> 44:23.660
All right, Mo, remember ten
and two, what I told you?

44:23.962 --> 44:26.162
Yeah. Just like that,
just hold it steady.

44:26.164 --> 44:28.131
You don't have
to hold it so tight.

44:28.133 --> 44:31.167
Just keep it steady,
keep it straight, okay?
Just breathe. You're okay.

44:33.872 --> 44:36.873
-How's that, MapQuest?
-MapQuest.

44:38.109 --> 44:39.842
I think I'm starting
to get the hang of this.

44:41.413 --> 44:42.679
Mo, Mo, go home!

44:42.681 --> 44:44.147
Mo, Mo, the brake!
Mo, the brake!

44:44.149 --> 44:47.717
[screaming]

45:00.031 --> 45:02.699
[grunting]

45:03.201 --> 45:04.267
Fuck!

45:05.870 --> 45:07.470
Is everyone okay?

45:07.472 --> 45:14.077
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
you guys. I can't move
my legs! [laughs]

45:14.079 --> 45:15.912
-Mo, you okay?
-I lost my glasses.

45:15.914 --> 45:17.480
-It's right here,
it's right here.
-I lost my fucking glasses.

45:17.482 --> 45:19.782
It's right here.
It's around your neck,
it's around your neck.

45:19.784 --> 45:21.918
-Woo!
-[Matt] Grab it. You have it.

45:22.454 --> 45:24.120
You hurt? Are you hurt anywhere?

45:24.923 --> 45:26.723
I think I'm okay.
Where are we?

45:27.459 --> 45:29.025
I don't know.
We're not driving anymore.

45:29.027 --> 45:30.610
You can take your hands
off the wheel.

45:30.611 --> 45:32.194
I didn't wanna fucking drive!
I told you I didn't wanna
fucking drive!

45:32.197 --> 45:34.831
-Mo should always drive.
-It was an accident.

45:35.233 --> 45:38.835
It was nobody's fault.
Mo can't drive. Got it.

45:38.837 --> 45:42.038
-Highlight of the trip so far.
-Scotty, don't, don't, just...

45:43.208 --> 45:47.777
-Ow! That was my dick.
-Stop. Stop. Both of you.

45:48.813 --> 45:49.946
Quiet.

45:50.949 --> 45:52.014
I'm gonna try to flag
someone down.

45:57.222 --> 45:58.321
Or not.

45:59.824 --> 46:00.890
Scotty,

46:00.892 --> 46:05.027
remember when you said
we're not stranded
in the wilderness?

46:05.830 --> 46:07.764
Don't say shit
like that ever again.

46:07.766 --> 46:09.899
Where are we?
We're in the wilderness?

46:15.840 --> 46:18.174
Act really cool. Just act cool.

46:20.278 --> 46:22.845
Whoa. You see that?

46:22.847 --> 46:24.313
He's got somewhere else to go.

46:25.850 --> 46:27.216
We're good.

46:30.955 --> 46:32.121
Oh, shit.

46:32.123 --> 46:34.557
-What?
-Oh, shit, oh, shit.

46:34.559 --> 46:35.925
Let me handle it, okay?

46:35.927 --> 46:36.959
Just let me handle it.

46:36.961 --> 46:38.127
Hello, officer.

46:38.129 --> 46:39.529
Oh, shit.

46:39.531 --> 46:41.898
-Is your vehicle
back there, the van?
-Yeah, it is.

46:44.068 --> 46:46.869
-Which one of you is driving?
-Sort of a team effort.

46:46.871 --> 46:49.172
-Yeah, I did the pedals.
-They-- They are kidding.

46:49.174 --> 46:52.175
Our driver bailed to get help.
That's why we're out here.

46:52.177 --> 46:53.843
Yeah.

46:55.046 --> 46:57.030
Everybody okay?

46:57.031 --> 46:59.015
Yeah, yeah, we swerved
to avoid a deer,

46:59.017 --> 47:01.851
so that's how we ended
up in a ditch.

47:01.853 --> 47:04.704
It was a deer.

47:04.705 --> 47:07.556
[clears throat]
227, I've got two
handicapped gentlemen.

47:07.559 --> 47:10.993
Sorry. Person
with disabilities, please.

47:13.298 --> 47:15.331
Two persons with disabilities
and a blind guy.

47:15.333 --> 47:18.034
Um, excuse me,
it's visually impaired.

47:18.036 --> 47:19.135
Yup.

47:19.137 --> 47:21.270
Visually impaired gentleman.

47:22.006 --> 47:26.576
Um, gonna need
a tow truck and a van
equipped for the disabled--

47:26.578 --> 47:30.179
the, um, persons
with disabilities.

47:30.181 --> 47:31.380
[cop over the radio]<i> Copy that.</i>

47:36.921 --> 47:42.191
My cousin's brother-in-law has
Down Syndrome, so... I know.

47:45.330 --> 47:47.463
-You good?
-Yeah, we're good, thank you.

47:48.399 --> 47:50.399
-Not good.
-She sounds happy.

47:50.401 --> 47:52.068
She's not.

47:57.942 --> 48:00.209
Does somebody
wanna explain to me

48:00.211 --> 48:03.312
what in the entire
fuck my van

48:03.314 --> 48:06.148
was doing in a ditch
on the side of the highway?

48:08.086 --> 48:12.021
Oh, my God. You fuckers.
This was a group decision.

48:12.023 --> 48:14.223
Our parents showed
up at the motel.
We had to bolt.

48:14.225 --> 48:17.226
-What are y'all keeping from me?
-We just told you.
Our parents were gonna squash

48:17.228 --> 48:19.128
the trip, and that's why-- yeah.

48:19.130 --> 48:22.431
Uh-huh! Bullshit, okay?
This is not adding up.

48:22.433 --> 48:26.302
I want all the cards
on the table right now
or we won't go anywhere.

48:26.304 --> 48:27.904
I'll stay right here.

48:28.406 --> 48:31.908
Shit. Mo, Mo.

48:31.910 --> 48:33.276
What? No, Matt,
you go talk to her.

48:33.278 --> 48:34.343
You talk to her.

48:34.345 --> 48:36.145
-She likes Mo.
-She's very scary.

48:36.147 --> 48:38.681
-Mo, just go make out with her.
-I don't care if she liked--

48:38.683 --> 48:41.083
Hey, hey, hey,
do not mention the brothel.

48:41.085 --> 48:43.953
Just don't mention the brothel.
Seriously, yeah.

48:45.056 --> 48:46.923
Was that a yes? Shit.

48:47.392 --> 48:50.092
He's gonna--
I give him 45 seconds
before he brings it up.

48:55.033 --> 48:59.402
-Sorry about the seat.
I had to move it.
-You drove?

49:01.272 --> 49:03.472
Well, it's a long st--

49:06.311 --> 49:07.944
we were really worried
about you.

49:07.946 --> 49:11.080
Look, it's not
gonna happen again, if that's
what you're worried about.

49:11.082 --> 49:13.349
No, Sam, we were worried
about you.

49:15.186 --> 49:16.953
I'm just glad you're okay.

49:17.422 --> 49:19.388
It was scary, you know?

49:21.459 --> 49:22.992
Look, it's, um.

49:24.429 --> 49:28.230
It's really awkward
to talk about.

49:30.969 --> 49:32.034
But you know,

49:33.104 --> 49:35.004
you don't get it.
Guys like us, we--

49:36.274 --> 49:38.341
we have a tough time
with women.

49:38.343 --> 49:42.178
It's not like we're insensitive
to the moral complications.

49:42.180 --> 49:45.281
By the way, I would never,
ever-- I would never take
advantage of anyone.

49:45.283 --> 49:50.052
It's just, it's not easy for us
with the opposite sex,

49:50.054 --> 49:53.522
and Scotty found a place
that, you know, caters

49:53.524 --> 49:57.193
to, you know, guys like us.

49:58.129 --> 50:02.431
Ah, you're going to get laid.

50:02.433 --> 50:07.169
Me, no. I would-- but we,
I mean, I would never--

50:07.171 --> 50:10.206
we are
as buddies on a field trip.

50:11.142 --> 50:13.576
We're just-- yeah.

50:16.247 --> 50:19.482
Thank God.
I thought you guys had
a suicide pact or something.

50:19.484 --> 50:25.087
-Suicide pact? What?
-Or maybe you were
across-the-border drug mules.

50:25.089 --> 50:30.026
-I really don't know you, so...
-No! No, we're not drug mules.

50:31.396 --> 50:35.264
No, that's absurd.
No, we're just, uh, virgins.

50:38.202 --> 50:39.268
Okay.

50:39.270 --> 50:42.405
She's coming back. I cannot--
I can't read her face.

50:46.044 --> 50:47.476
I'll let you know right now.

50:47.478 --> 50:51.047
If you want me in the room,
that's gonna be extra.

50:52.083 --> 50:53.315
-What room?
-Yeah.

50:53.785 --> 50:56.485
-In the room with the hooker.
-[both] Mo!

50:56.487 --> 50:59.355
You had one thing
not to say, and you said it.

50:59.357 --> 51:01.257
She thought we had
a suicide pact.

51:01.259 --> 51:03.893
Why would we have
a suicide pact?

51:03.894 --> 51:06.528
I have no idea,
but I see a lot of weird shit
on this job, okay?

51:06.531 --> 51:09.265
Does that mean we're good to go?

51:09.267 --> 51:11.200
Yeah, I'm not your mama.

51:11.202 --> 51:13.235
I'm not your mama,
I'm not your girlfriend,

51:13.237 --> 51:15.438
and as long as you're a
hundred percent honest with me,

51:15.440 --> 51:17.473
we're good.
Let's get in the van.

51:18.543 --> 51:20.509
-[Scotty] Mo.
-[Matt] Mo.

51:21.813 --> 51:24.080
[rapping]

51:29.153 --> 51:31.487
-What the hell?
-Dude, if we're gonna
listen to you,

51:31.489 --> 51:33.856
can we at least listen
to some of your stuff?

51:33.858 --> 51:35.975
Some Scotty B?

51:35.976 --> 51:38.093
Hey, you guys
know that Scotty has
a secret life as a rapper?

51:38.096 --> 51:39.562
-[Scotty] Dude, don't be douche.
-[Matt] I was rolling up
to his room,

51:39.564 --> 51:42.164
and I saw him in the middle
of spitting his game.

51:42.166 --> 51:44.500
-Oh, man, do you want me
to kick a beat for you?
-Yeah!

51:44.502 --> 51:46.869
-Want a fresh beat?
-[Mo] Wait, is that serious?

51:46.871 --> 51:48.370
-Holy shit!
-Let's do it, Scotty.

51:48.372 --> 51:50.139
-Come on, man!
-Sam, you're good at that.

51:50.141 --> 51:52.408
-Come on, Scotty.
-¶ <i> My name is Scotty </i> ¶

51:52.410 --> 51:54.643
¶ <i> And I cannot rap</i>
<i> My name is Scotty </i> ¶

51:54.645 --> 51:57.847
-Okay, I can't keep going.
-Fuck you guys.

51:57.849 --> 51:59.515
What, you can dish it,
but you can't take it?

52:07.358 --> 52:09.158
[Sam] Who's at home missing
you tonight?

52:10.194 --> 52:13.295
[Mo] Um, just my mom.

52:14.398 --> 52:17.199
Though I'll tell you
a little secret.

52:18.136 --> 52:20.336
I told her about this trip
the night before we left.

52:20.605 --> 52:22.138
How'd she take it?

52:23.207 --> 52:25.274
-She cried.
-Aw.

52:26.377 --> 52:30.412
Yeah, but then she actually
wanted me to go.

52:32.550 --> 52:35.618
She said she'd keep the secret.

52:37.421 --> 52:41.223
Sweet. Her 35-year-old baby is
about to lose his virginity.

52:42.927 --> 52:45.227
-Ha-ha.
-[laughing]

52:45.663 --> 52:47.263
What about you?
Who do you have at home?

52:47.665 --> 52:49.732
No one, really. I, um,

52:50.902 --> 52:54.336
I used to be married,
but not anymore, thankfully.

52:55.239 --> 52:58.207
-What happened?
-Oh, I shot him.

52:58.209 --> 53:00.276
-What?
-[Sam laughs]

53:00.278 --> 53:03.379
I shot him in the ass
with some insulin.

53:03.381 --> 53:04.914
-Wait, really?
-Yeah really.

53:04.916 --> 53:07.483
He was on top
of our neighbor at the time,

53:08.586 --> 53:09.718
so serves him right.

53:09.720 --> 53:12.922
I mean, it was super fun
when I was doing it,

53:12.924 --> 53:18.694
but, uh, then I lost
my nursing license
for three years. And--

53:19.397 --> 53:20.796
So now I'm single.

53:25.403 --> 53:27.736
Can I ask you
a question? Uh--

53:29.273 --> 53:31.941
you know, this is
my first time doing this,

53:31.943 --> 53:34.610
and I was thinking
maybe since you're a nurse
that you could...

53:34.612 --> 53:37.413
Wait. Do you think
that just because I'm a nurse,

53:37.415 --> 53:41.283
-I can give you
like sex tips?
-Well, I mean, yeah.

53:41.285 --> 53:44.253
Okay, you are
clearly as confused

53:44.255 --> 53:47.356
about the concept
of nursing as you are
about the concept of sex.

53:49.694 --> 53:51.427
Okay, I mean, now I am, yeah.

53:52.763 --> 53:58.400
Okay, I'm sorry.
Just let biology take over.

53:58.970 --> 54:00.402
Don't plan anything.

54:06.444 --> 54:07.676
Where's that money?

54:08.512 --> 54:11.580
-Oh, uh, it's, um--
-Oh, right here.

54:11.582 --> 54:13.782
-No, I got-- Oh, sorry.
-Sorry.

54:13.784 --> 54:16.318
-Oh, I see it.
-There it is.

54:16.320 --> 54:17.620
Thank you.

54:18.356 --> 54:19.488
Nice tattoo.

54:21.459 --> 54:22.524
You felt that?

54:23.327 --> 54:26.729
Yeah, the ink,
it raises the skin.

54:26.731 --> 54:29.732
-Sorry, I didn't mean to.
-No, it's okay.

54:30.735 --> 54:32.368
Do you think I can, um,

54:34.538 --> 54:36.405
I bet if I touch it,
I could tell you.

54:39.610 --> 54:41.410
Like that's a branch--
no, I mean, uh--

54:42.413 --> 54:43.679
that's a small wing.

54:44.782 --> 54:45.881
Okay.

54:47.351 --> 54:48.751
Little bird?

54:50.621 --> 54:51.787
Is that a goldfinch?

54:52.623 --> 54:54.890
-Wow.
-[honking]

54:56.360 --> 54:58.560
-[honking]
-[driver] Move it!

54:58.562 --> 55:01.330
Ugh, sorry. [clears throat]

55:44.075 --> 55:46.375
I think it's time
to call the police.

55:46.377 --> 55:48.744
They went on a trip, Roger.
They didn't get kidnapped.

55:49.513 --> 55:51.847
You know, Matt
wouldn't have done this,
unless he had a reason.

55:52.516 --> 55:53.816
[Roger] I'm at a loss.

55:57.722 --> 56:01.423
Hi. I'm trying to locate
my son, who may have used
your services to take a trip.

56:01.425 --> 56:03.625
Last name, Kwong,
also might be under Brandt.

-Hey, where you going?
-In for the kill.

57:02.620 --> 57:04.553
Nice. We'll be here.

57:04.889 --> 57:05.954
Cute girls?

57:06.657 --> 57:08.857
This place is
like a babe vortex.

57:08.859 --> 57:11.593
No wonder I wasn't
getting laid back home.
All the hotties were here.

57:11.595 --> 57:14.463
Yeah, it's got nothing to do
with your rancid personality.

57:14.465 --> 57:16.565
Wait, hold up.
What about Sarah, man?

57:16.567 --> 57:18.901
From the clinic?
What about her?

57:18.903 --> 57:21.437
-She likes you, man.
-Get the fuck out of here.

57:21.439 --> 57:24.706
Fact, every time you
come in there, she starts
biting her fingernails.

57:24.708 --> 57:27.943
-How do you know that?
-Well, because, you know,
I pay attention, unlike you

57:27.945 --> 57:33.215
because you're too busy
always eye-groping Becky's,
you know, big...

57:33.217 --> 57:34.883
-You talking about titties?
-Yup.

57:34.885 --> 57:38.654
-Okay.
-First of all,
I don't eye-grope, okay?

57:38.656 --> 57:40.856
I happen to live at tit level.

57:40.858 --> 57:43.459
Everywhere I go,
all I see are tits, tits, tits.

57:43.461 --> 57:45.594
That's the personality
I was talking about.

57:46.497 --> 57:48.697
[Mo] What's going on?
Cute girls?

57:48.699 --> 57:50.833
-Oh.
-[Scotty] See what I mean?

57:50.835 --> 57:53.869
-Okay, I get it.
-If Sarah is so awesome,
why don't you just ask her out?

57:53.871 --> 57:55.704
No, man, not my type.

57:55.706 --> 57:58.607
-What is that, exactly?
-What is my--

57:58.609 --> 58:01.677
my type is like, uh, I like...

58:01.679 --> 58:05.514
-Hey, you guys ready
for another drink?
-Yes, absolutely.

58:05.516 --> 58:07.816
-Nah, I'm good.
-Mo, grow a scrotum.

58:07.818 --> 58:09.685
You're getting fucked up
with us tonight.

58:09.687 --> 58:11.687
All right, I'll have one
more vodka cran. That's it.

58:11.689 --> 58:14.756
-Whiskey. You got it.
-Here we go.

58:17.795 --> 58:20.529
-She's growing on me.
-Yeah, man, she's cool.

58:21.232 --> 58:25.033
It was a bachelorette party,
and most of them have
boyfriends.

58:25.035 --> 58:26.869
-Over there?
-Mm-hmm.

58:26.870 --> 58:28.704
-Aw.
-We can do better.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

58:28.706 --> 58:30.706
-I'll come with you.
-I'll hold the fort.

58:34.612 --> 58:35.744
Excuse me.

58:36.547 --> 58:37.746
I'm never going home.

58:39.717 --> 58:42.985
Hey, check it out.
I think the Special Olympics
are in town.

58:42.987 --> 58:45.087
What's that called,
the blind leading the cripple?

58:45.856 --> 58:47.923
Come one, come on!

58:57.768 --> 59:01.670
Hi, I'm trying to locate my son,
who might have used
your services to take a trip.

59:01.672 --> 59:03.906
Last name, Kwong,
also might be under Brandt.

59:07.545 --> 59:08.710
You do?

59:08.712 --> 59:10.546
[phone buzzing]

59:10.548 --> 59:15.918
[man] What's up, baby girl?
I like a lady with some junk
in her trunk.

59:16.987 --> 59:21.023
-Blow me, asshole.
-That's a compliment, bitch.

59:21.025 --> 59:23.058
Look, who is you
calling a bitch?

59:23.060 --> 59:25.961
Yo, why don't you take
your girlfriend home
before I beat her ass?

59:25.963 --> 59:27.930
She's a feisty one too, huh?
I like that.

59:28.632 --> 59:31.733
Do you? Do you like that?
What are you doing?

59:32.770 --> 59:36.038
Oh, shit, seriously?
You're with Special Olympics?

59:36.040 --> 59:40.642
You're gonna apologize to her
right now, or you will be sorry.

59:40.644 --> 59:43.078
Oh, this guy wants to fight me.
Oh, I love it.

59:43.080 --> 59:46.748
You're lucky, bro.
You don't have to look at her.
She's a real two-bag special.

59:46.750 --> 59:48.317
-Fuck you.
-[man two] Forget him. Let's go.

59:48.319 --> 59:51.820
-No, man, she's coming around.
-Oh! Shit.

59:52.656 --> 59:53.855
-Oh, yeah?
-What are you--

59:53.857 --> 59:54.990
-[Mo] Did you just hit him?
-Bitch!

59:54.992 --> 59:58.660
We have to go.
Okay, we have to go. Matt!

59:59.930 --> 1:00:02.831
You just fucked up. Oh!

1:00:02.833 --> 1:00:06.001
Aah!

1:00:06.937 --> 1:00:08.036
[man] Jesus!

1:00:18.782 --> 1:00:21.149
-[people cheering]
-Woo!

1:00:23.387 --> 1:00:25.921
-Like when I came
at that guy with my chair?
-Incredible.

1:00:25.923 --> 1:00:28.991
Can we not get cocky?
It was three on one, all right?

1:00:28.993 --> 1:00:33.695
Yeah, but we're a good team.
We're like the--
we're like the dynamic duo.

1:00:33.697 --> 1:00:37.933
-Yeah, we should go pro.
-We should go semi-pro at least.

1:00:40.104 --> 1:00:42.704
Hey, that looks
pretty fun up there.

1:00:42.706 --> 1:00:45.107
Mo, you got legs.
Show us what you got.

1:00:45.109 --> 1:00:47.409
-Oh, no, no, I don't dance.
-Come on!

1:00:47.411 --> 1:00:49.845
-I do not dance.
-You don't dance?

1:00:49.847 --> 1:00:51.880
-No.
-Put your drink down.

1:00:51.882 --> 1:00:53.715
-No, no, I'm serious.
-[Scotty] Yes.

1:00:53.717 --> 1:00:56.151
-Okay.
-[Scotty] Oh, this is happening.

1:00:56.153 --> 1:00:59.921
-[Mo] No, no, no
-[Scotty] Yes. Yes.

1:01:01.959 --> 1:01:05.827
Oh, this'll be a disaster.
Hey, hey, Matt, where you going?

1:01:06.730 --> 1:01:07.929
Don't leave me here, dude.

1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:10.766
Matt.

1:01:27.418 --> 1:01:28.684
Hey.

1:01:32.222 --> 1:01:33.922
Give me another shot.

1:01:41.899 --> 1:01:43.865
So are you guys like hanging
out here for a little bit,

1:01:43.867 --> 1:01:45.834
-or are you...
-We're on our way to Montreal.

1:01:46.136 --> 1:01:49.971
-Okay.
-Yeah, because there's
a great hiking trail there.

1:01:52.142 --> 1:01:53.842
That was a joke.

1:01:53.844 --> 1:01:56.812
-I got it, I got it.
-I'm glad you got it.

1:01:58.916 --> 1:02:00.716
-[Scotty] Hey.
-[Mo] Hey.

1:02:00.718 --> 1:02:02.250
Time to go, Romeo.

1:02:02.252 --> 1:02:05.153
Hey, you guys go on ahead.
I think I'm gonna hang back.

1:02:05.155 --> 1:02:08.790
-How you gonna get back
to the hotel?
-I'll figure it out.

1:02:08.792 --> 1:02:09.991
-[Sam] You sure?
-Yeah.

1:02:09.993 --> 1:02:12.127
-[Mo] He's fine. Let's go.
-Be safe.

1:02:13.931 --> 1:02:15.997
Have fun with your bachelorette.

1:02:19.203 --> 1:02:21.937
-[phone ringing]
- Uh!

1:02:30.781 --> 1:02:33.148
Hey, uh, sorry I missed
your call. What's up?

1:02:38.489 --> 1:02:39.905
Yeah, they're with me. Why?

1:02:39.906 --> 1:02:41.322
[girl] I love this city
in the summer. It gets so hot.

1:02:42.092 --> 1:02:44.292
-Cold as fuck during the winter.
-Yeah, exactly.

1:02:44.294 --> 1:02:47.963
You know what one
of my favorite things
to do in the summer is?

1:02:47.965 --> 1:02:51.066
-What?
-Swim in Lake Michigan.

1:02:51.068 --> 1:02:53.902
-Wait, have you been
to the beach yet?
-No, no, I haven't.

1:02:54.505 --> 1:02:56.505
Oh, so we should go?

1:02:56.507 --> 1:02:59.274
-You mean like right now?
-Yeah.

1:03:02.846 --> 1:03:06.548
What, you're serious?
I mean, are we even allowed
to be there at night?

1:03:06.550 --> 1:03:07.916
No.

1:03:09.219 --> 1:03:10.285
But...

1:03:13.891 --> 1:03:16.925
It is the only time
that we can go skinny dipping.

1:03:19.997 --> 1:03:21.096
Can you swim?

1:03:23.834 --> 1:03:24.900
I got arms.

1:03:31.909 --> 1:03:33.408
What do I do? What do I do?

1:03:34.912 --> 1:03:37.412
-Aah!
-What do I need to do?

1:03:48.992 --> 1:03:51.092
[Mo] Oh, my head feels
like a hurt factory.

1:03:52.196 --> 1:03:55.931
Maybe because you dropped it
like a bunker bus around
that guy's face last night.

1:03:56.266 --> 1:03:58.233
What was that thing
you made me drink?

1:03:58.235 --> 1:03:59.968
It's called the Dirty Sanchez.

1:04:00.571 --> 1:04:04.372
Bald Turkey whiskey
and 151 Bacardi,
a shot of espresso.

1:04:05.342 --> 1:04:06.575
You did four.

1:04:06.577 --> 1:04:08.310
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

1:04:08.312 --> 1:04:10.378
It vastly improved
your dance moves though.

1:04:14.852 --> 1:04:16.318
Where's Scotty?

1:04:17.354 --> 1:04:19.988
I think he had
a rough night, man.

1:04:20.624 --> 1:04:21.890
What happened?

1:04:21.892 --> 1:04:26.862
I don't know, man.
I think sometimes he hurts
more than we know.

1:04:31.034 --> 1:04:32.267
Fuck's taking so long up here?

1:04:36.139 --> 1:04:39.074
Hey, man, I heard you
had a rough night.

1:04:40.077 --> 1:04:41.910
Listen, I know what it's like.

1:04:41.912 --> 1:04:43.912
Got some pills here
if you want to take,

1:04:43.914 --> 1:04:45.180
-take the edge off for you.
-What'd you say?

1:04:45.182 --> 1:04:48.984
-I said I have a bunch
of pain pills that you can take.
-You know what it's like?

1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:52.954
Yeah, dude. You're
not the only one with problems.

1:04:54.224 --> 1:04:55.290
Really?

1:04:55.292 --> 1:04:57.425
You think just
because you're in that chair

1:05:00.030 --> 1:05:01.013
it makes us anything alike?

1:05:01.014 --> 1:05:01.997
Come talk to me when you
can't take a shit by yourself.

1:05:01.999 --> 1:05:05.000
Talk to me when you
spend a night crawling
out of your skin

1:05:05.002 --> 1:05:07.168
because you can't move.
You know what it's like?

1:05:07.671 --> 1:05:09.905
Try this on for size.
You don't know dick.

1:05:10.674 --> 1:05:13.108
-[elevator bell dings]
-Ugh, finally.

1:05:16.013 --> 1:05:19.447
[woman] Do you have any idea
how irresponsible you've been?

1:05:20.250 --> 1:05:21.316
Come on.

1:05:21.318 --> 1:05:25.387
[Roger] Do you realize
I had to cancel
very important business calls?

1:05:25.389 --> 1:05:27.689
[mother] How could you not tell
us that you were leaving?

1:05:27.691 --> 1:05:31.226
We ditched our phones that's
why we weren't picking up.

1:05:31.228 --> 1:05:33.929
We thought you were dead.
We were so scared.

1:05:33.931 --> 1:05:36.264
Oh, my God, that's so dramatic,
so dramatic!

1:05:36.266 --> 1:05:38.066
I was so scared.

1:05:38.068 --> 1:05:40.268
[indistinct shouting]

1:05:40.270 --> 1:05:42.003
[Scotty] We're not kids!
We're grown ass men!

1:05:42.005 --> 1:05:43.672
If we wanna go
on a fucking trip,
we can go on a fucking trip!

1:05:43.674 --> 1:05:45.407
-Scotty, calm down, man.
-No!

1:05:45.408 --> 1:05:47.141
I've been putting up
with this bullshit
all my life, okay?

1:05:47.144 --> 1:05:48.977
-Oh, Scott!
-Yeah.

1:05:48.979 --> 1:05:52.247
It's been so hard for you.
So melodramatic? Oh, my God.

1:05:52.249 --> 1:05:56.017
I'm melodramatic? I'm not
the one who chased their kid
all the way to fucking--

1:05:56.019 --> 1:05:58.987
-That's enough, okay?
We're leaving.
-What do you mean?

1:05:58.989 --> 1:06:00.689
-We've got a plane to catch.
-No.

1:06:00.691 --> 1:06:05.727
-Matthew, this is not
up for discussion.
-Stop it! Stop!

1:06:05.729 --> 1:06:07.963
-Come on, Matthew.
-We're going to a brothel.

1:06:11.435 --> 1:06:13.435
What the fuck, Matt?

1:06:13.437 --> 1:06:15.437
For the record,
this was not my idea.

1:06:15.439 --> 1:06:18.974
These guys wanted
to lose their virginity,
and I, you know--

1:06:18.976 --> 1:06:20.742
I thought we were going
on a fun field trip.

1:06:20.744 --> 1:06:23.178
Stop calling it a field trip.
It's not a fucking field trip.

1:06:23.180 --> 1:06:25.380
-What is it, the fifth grade?
-Oh, then what is it?

1:06:25.382 --> 1:06:27.315
-It's a road trip!
-What's the difference?

1:06:27.317 --> 1:06:29.484
-Twenty years!
-You know what?
I'm with Mo on this.

1:06:29.486 --> 1:06:31.720
Well, congratulations.
You ruined everything.

1:06:31.722 --> 1:06:33.989
You ruined last night.
You're ruining this.

1:06:33.991 --> 1:06:35.423
You're a selfish prick.

1:06:35.425 --> 1:06:38.059
I'm a selfish fucking prick.
I'm a selfish fucking prick?

1:06:38.061 --> 1:06:40.729
-I'm a selfish
fucking prick? Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

1:06:40.731 --> 1:06:43.431
-I'm fucking selfish?!
Are you fucking kidding me?
-Fuck you!

1:06:43.433 --> 1:06:45.266
-Stop, stop, stop!
-Come on! Come at me!

1:06:45.268 --> 1:06:48.203
Fuck you, man!
You know what? You know what?

1:06:48.205 --> 1:06:51.406
You two aren't virgins
because you two
are disabled, okay?

1:06:51.408 --> 1:06:53.742
You're a fucking virgin
because you're a loser,

1:06:53.744 --> 1:06:57.345
-and you're a fucking virgin
because you're an asshole!
-Matt!

1:07:16.366 --> 1:07:17.432
I'm sorry.

1:07:23.040 --> 1:07:25.573
I didn't tell you
because I was ashamed.

1:07:27.144 --> 1:07:30.078
But I'm not ashamed anymore.

1:07:35.585 --> 1:07:37.385
And I'm not asking
for permission.

1:07:45.062 --> 1:07:48.663
-I should-- I should know--
-Can I? Please, please stop.
Just--

1:07:52.402 --> 1:07:54.335
For once don't talk, okay?
Just listen.

1:08:02.813 --> 1:08:03.946
I'm 24 years old.

1:08:03.947 --> 1:08:05.080
I need to know what sex
is gonna be like for me.

1:08:06.349 --> 1:08:10.485
This guy told me
about a place up in Montreal--

1:08:13.090 --> 1:08:14.556
that caters to people like us.

1:08:18.095 --> 1:08:19.227
So that's where we're going.

1:08:23.533 --> 1:08:24.632
Roger.

1:08:28.171 --> 1:08:29.237
Uh--

1:08:30.841 --> 1:08:32.107
Give us a minute.

1:08:37.514 --> 1:08:41.282
-I'm sorry I didn't call.
-No, no, I should know.
I should know this about you.

1:08:41.284 --> 1:08:44.319
I should know this.
Of course, you would wanna do
something like this.

1:08:44.321 --> 1:08:46.221
-This is my fault.
-No, it's not your fault.

1:08:46.223 --> 1:08:48.456
-It is, it is. It's not.
-No, listen to me, stop.

1:08:48.458 --> 1:08:50.325
-But no, but you--
-Stop beating yourself up.

1:08:50.327 --> 1:08:52.260
-You need to trust me.
-Ma, I do trust you.

1:08:52.262 --> 1:08:53.528
It's just,
"Mom, I want a hooker,"

1:08:53.530 --> 1:08:55.663
is not the easiest conversation
to have.

1:08:55.665 --> 1:08:58.399
-I understand.
-You know? It's a little--

1:08:59.202 --> 1:09:00.401
It's dicey.

1:09:06.476 --> 1:09:07.542
[Scotty] I love you.

1:09:09.146 --> 1:09:10.411
Sorry I didn't call.

1:09:27.397 --> 1:09:29.597
I understand it's
morally ambiguous

1:09:29.599 --> 1:09:32.233
and a little bit dangerous,
but we have
to let them do this.

1:09:32.235 --> 1:09:34.903
-This is what young men do.
-A little bit dangerous?
No, listen to yourselves.

1:09:34.905 --> 1:09:38.573
I am not signing off
on a trip to a whorehouse.

1:09:38.575 --> 1:09:40.675
-Stop calling it that.
-That's what it is.

1:09:40.677 --> 1:09:43.278
-Sex workers.
-They need to know
there's nothing wrong

1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:45.446
-with what they want.
-Yes.

1:09:45.448 --> 1:09:46.481
You can't be serious.

1:09:48.251 --> 1:09:51.686
Actually, I am.
So, get over your discomfort.

1:09:51.688 --> 1:09:53.454
We are going to support
him in this,

1:09:53.456 --> 1:09:55.356
and we are going to pay
for it too.

1:09:55.659 --> 1:10:00.361
You listen to me.
This is not happening.
No, no, and no.

1:10:05.368 --> 1:10:08.703
Y'all look pissed off,
but let me just say before you
get a attitude with me,

1:10:08.705 --> 1:10:10.572
that none of this
is actually my fault.

1:10:10.574 --> 1:10:13.308
They were gonna report me
to my fucking nursing board.

1:10:13.310 --> 1:10:16.411
Then it'd be over.
Two strikes
and I'd be done, okay?

1:10:16.413 --> 1:10:19.214
And on top of that,
like I don't even
really do this,

1:10:19.216 --> 1:10:22.383
like all these like long haul
like road trips or whatever.

1:10:22.385 --> 1:10:23.618
-Sam.
-Like I don't really do that.

1:10:23.620 --> 1:10:26.654
I do short trips,
and I do in-home.

1:10:26.656 --> 1:10:30.258
I get in, I get out,
I mind my goddamn business.

1:10:30.260 --> 1:10:31.492
-[Matt] Sam.
-What?

1:10:31.494 --> 1:10:33.394
Trip's back on. We can go.

1:10:35.432 --> 1:10:36.631
Oh, okay, cool.

1:11:20.610 --> 1:11:22.644
Where are we going?
I thought the hotel
was downtown.

1:11:22.646 --> 1:11:26.281
Actually, your parents
canceled your reservation
and gave you an upgrade.

1:11:42.832 --> 1:11:45.300
Holy crap. You ever taken
a steam before?

1:11:45.302 --> 1:11:48.770
-What? They got a sauna in here?
-Oh, dude, amazing.

1:11:48.772 --> 1:11:51.506
Wow. They got
a Jacuzzi out back.
I say we hit that later too.

1:11:51.508 --> 1:11:54.642
-Yes. Oh my God!
Talk about a workout, huh?
-Yeah.

1:11:54.644 --> 1:11:56.644
-This place is great.
-Where's the douche bag?

1:11:57.514 --> 1:12:02.050
-Dude, by the way, I
was thinking about that.
-Ow! Look at this!

1:12:02.052 --> 1:12:04.319
-Will you stop?
It's just a dress.
-What's going on?

1:12:04.321 --> 1:12:06.754
-Sam is in a very nice
dinner dress.
-Ooh.

1:12:06.756 --> 1:12:10.525
-So, when do you wanna go
to the Le Chateau Paradis?
-Tomorrow.

1:12:10.527 --> 1:12:14.862
-Yeah, today's out for me, so--
-Yeah. I think tomorrow is good.

1:12:14.864 --> 1:12:18.399
-How about just dinner
on the town tonight?
-Okay.

1:12:19.436 --> 1:12:22.937
-Dinner tonight,
prostitution tomorrow.
-Okay.

1:12:33.817 --> 1:12:35.650
Hello. No one's talking.

1:12:37.687 --> 1:12:39.354
I wouldn't know.
I'm just a loser.

1:12:44.427 --> 1:12:45.560
Mo, I'm sorry I--

1:12:46.696 --> 1:12:48.496
called you a loser,
I didn't mean it.

1:12:49.899 --> 1:12:51.366
That's all right, man.

1:12:51.735 --> 1:12:53.634
I'm sorry I threw
you under the bus.

1:12:54.571 --> 1:12:56.571
I should have had your back,
back there.

1:12:57.907 --> 1:12:58.973
I'm sorry.

1:13:04.881 --> 1:13:07.749
Hey, where's my apology?
Hey, Matt.

1:13:07.751 --> 1:13:09.550
-Dude, can you take it easy?
-No, no, no, no.

1:13:09.552 --> 1:13:11.069
He got an apology.
I want one too.

1:13:11.070 --> 1:13:12.587
You left me at a table
by myself in Chicago.

1:13:12.589 --> 1:13:14.689
You called me an asshole
in front of my mother.

1:13:14.691 --> 1:13:15.957
I mean, what the fuck is that?

1:13:17.127 --> 1:13:18.559
I would love an apology.

1:13:22.465 --> 1:13:23.531
I'm sorry.

1:13:24.167 --> 1:13:25.666
That wasn't very genuine.

1:13:26.169 --> 1:13:27.635
What are you sorry for, Biceps?

1:13:27.637 --> 1:13:30.505
Where you going, huh?

1:13:30.907 --> 1:13:32.607
I said what are you sorry for?

1:13:32.609 --> 1:13:33.841
-[Sam] Scotty.
-What?

1:13:34.878 --> 1:13:35.977
He's dying.

1:13:39.916 --> 1:13:41.949
That's why he's been taking
all the pills, dude.

1:13:41.951 --> 1:13:45.887
You would have noticed that
if you weren't too busy being
an asshole all the time.

1:13:57.567 --> 1:13:58.633
Knock, knock.

1:14:03.706 --> 1:14:05.706
[sighs] You're right,
I am an asshole.

1:14:07.744 --> 1:14:08.810
Yeah.

1:14:14.617 --> 1:14:15.783
It's part of your charm.

1:14:26.729 --> 1:14:27.795
I, uh,

1:14:31.935 --> 1:14:34.735
spend a lot of time feeling
like I was on the outside
of stuff.

1:14:38.208 --> 1:14:39.474
It sucked.

1:14:41.244 --> 1:14:44.479
Ever since we all started
hanging out, it--

1:14:45.014 --> 1:14:47.782
I don't know,
it just feels different,
like I'm included.

1:14:51.888 --> 1:14:53.488
When you bailed on us,

1:14:54.657 --> 1:14:56.591
it felt like I was back
on the outside.

1:15:03.533 --> 1:15:04.599
I'm sorry.

1:15:09.572 --> 1:15:10.638
Can I ask you a question?

1:15:12.542 --> 1:15:13.641
Are we friends?

1:15:18.615 --> 1:15:19.780
Of course, we're friends.

1:15:28.558 --> 1:15:29.624
Hey.

1:15:34.998 --> 1:15:36.063
Thank you.

1:15:38.268 --> 1:15:39.534
For what?

1:15:43.006 --> 1:15:44.071
For this.

1:15:53.950 --> 1:15:59.720
-You wanna take my knight
with your bishop, G8 to D5.
-Oh, you are so annoying.

1:16:00.056 --> 1:16:02.590
Why are you
even playing with me?

1:16:02.592 --> 1:16:03.925
You're basically
playing yourself.

1:16:03.927 --> 1:16:07.128
I don't know how you do--
and how did you...

1:16:08.031 --> 1:16:10.598
Like how did you see
my tattoo earlier?

1:16:13.069 --> 1:16:17.905
I mean, you know, it's
something I just taught myself.

1:16:18.875 --> 1:16:20.775
So, growing up,

1:16:21.945 --> 1:16:23.644
I walked myself
to and from school,

1:16:23.646 --> 1:16:24.946
and there were these
walls with these murals,

1:16:24.948 --> 1:16:26.614
and I really wanted
to see them.

1:16:27.116 --> 1:16:28.149
So, uh...

1:16:29.586 --> 1:16:32.119
yeah, that was
how I figured it out.

1:16:34.324 --> 1:16:38.626
-Well, it's a cool party trick.
-Yeah, I didn't go
to many parties growing up.

1:16:43.066 --> 1:16:45.800
Do you wanna finish
reading my tattoo?

1:16:48.805 --> 1:16:50.738
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

1:16:51.341 --> 1:16:52.673
Okay, I'm gonna...

1:16:52.675 --> 1:16:57.078
-I'll just get a little close
to you, if that's okay.
-Okay.

1:16:57.080 --> 1:16:58.879
-Yeah, just gonna...
-Okay.

1:17:05.622 --> 1:17:07.855
Okay, so that's the bird,

1:17:07.857 --> 1:17:09.957
the goldfinch, which...

1:17:09.959 --> 1:17:14.061
usually represents sacrifice
or rebirth.

1:17:14.831 --> 1:17:17.999
And the raising up
of a person over their sick bed.

1:17:19.135 --> 1:17:21.636
Then what do
these branches mean?

1:17:22.639 --> 1:17:26.641
White heather.
They represent protection
and luck.

1:17:32.682 --> 1:17:33.848
You have really soft skin.

1:17:34.751 --> 1:17:36.183
That's because I'm black.

1:17:37.820 --> 1:17:38.886
Hold up.

1:17:39.656 --> 1:17:40.721
You're black?

1:17:48.431 --> 1:17:51.198
Guys, I gotta--
I gotta ask you guys something.

1:17:52.402 --> 1:17:56.037
-What's up?
-It's kind of awkward, so don't
make fun of me, all right?

1:17:56.039 --> 1:17:58.406
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, what's up?

1:17:58.408 --> 1:18:00.941
-I need one of you
to shave my dick.
-Fuck no. No dude.

1:18:00.943 --> 1:18:03.210
-It's hard for me to even ask.
-Yeah, I would hope so.

1:18:03.212 --> 1:18:05.713
-No, uh-uh.
-I mean, yeah.
Mo, you should do it.

1:18:05.715 --> 1:18:07.715
-What?
-Yeah, you won't be scarred
by the visual.

1:18:15.925 --> 1:18:16.991
Just in case.

1:18:24.167 --> 1:18:26.233
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1:18:27.103 --> 1:18:29.036
You're like Redfoo upside-down.

1:18:29.772 --> 1:18:31.906
-Why am I here again?
-I just need you for
moral support.

1:18:31.908 --> 1:18:34.942
Plus, I've never seen anybody
with pubic hair extensions.

1:18:34.944 --> 1:18:37.011
You can be a jerk about this,
or you can just get it done.

1:18:37.714 --> 1:18:39.113
-Might as well.
-Right?

1:18:43.953 --> 1:18:46.887
-Thanks again for doing this.
Really appreciate it.
-[Matt sighs]

1:18:46.889 --> 1:18:49.790
-[machine buzzing]
-[Scotty] Uhm.

1:18:53.196 --> 1:18:54.295
Ooh, breezy.

1:18:58.501 --> 1:18:59.867
Hey there.

1:19:59.562 --> 1:20:00.995
[Sam] Looking good, fellas.

1:21:30.953 --> 1:21:34.121
-<i> Bonjour. </i> Welcome.
-[all] Hello.

1:21:35.191 --> 1:21:36.891
Right this way, gentlemen.

1:22:03.386 --> 1:22:05.153
Wow.

1:22:05.154 --> 1:22:06.921
-Drinks?
-Bourbon. Make it a double.

1:22:07.356 --> 1:22:09.456
-Same.
-Water is fine.

1:22:13.229 --> 1:22:14.962
[whispers]

1:22:22.371 --> 1:22:26.006
[whispers]

1:22:58.741 --> 1:23:00.007
What's your name?

1:23:01.077 --> 1:23:03.077
Scotty. What's yours?

1:23:03.512 --> 1:23:04.578
Chantal.

1:23:06.215 --> 1:23:07.982
Nice to meet you.

1:23:09.719 --> 1:23:10.985
Come.

1:23:30.473 --> 1:23:31.538
You're very beautiful.

1:23:34.143 --> 1:23:35.209
Thank you.

1:23:41.217 --> 1:23:42.549
You want to, uh...

1:23:44.186 --> 1:23:46.420
No. I mean, yeah.

1:23:46.422 --> 1:23:50.424
No, just, uh-- not just yet.

1:23:54.497 --> 1:23:55.562
Wanna help me with that drink?

1:23:56.565 --> 1:23:58.298
<i> Oui.</i> Relax.

1:24:09.111 --> 1:24:10.310
Could use another one of those.

1:24:28.264 --> 1:24:30.197
Mo. Mo.

1:24:33.402 --> 1:24:35.602
[Scotty]
Hey. Mo, what the fuck?

1:24:35.604 --> 1:24:38.338
Dude, I'm sorry, Scotty,
I can't do it, okay?

1:24:38.340 --> 1:24:41.141
You came 2,000 miles
to not have sex with one
of these beautiful women?

1:24:41.143 --> 1:24:42.810
-Mo, they're throwing
themselves at us.
-That's exactly what's wrong

1:24:42.812 --> 1:24:45.579
with this place.
It is not real, okay?

1:24:48.451 --> 1:24:50.284
Look, I'm happy for you.

1:24:50.286 --> 1:24:53.187
It's gonna be great, and I'm
sure it's amazing, but for me,

1:24:53.189 --> 1:24:56.523
I just-- I just can't, man.
It just...

1:24:57.526 --> 1:25:02.229
I think I just need
my first time
to be with someone special.

1:25:02.231 --> 1:25:03.297
Yeah, I want that too.

1:25:05.634 --> 1:25:07.301
But that's not gonna
happen for me.

1:25:08.170 --> 1:25:10.504
I know that.
I've made my peace with it.

1:25:13.142 --> 1:25:16.410
-Hope you don't judge me for it.
-Never, never. I...

1:25:24.854 --> 1:25:26.120
Go get her, buddy.

1:25:30.659 --> 1:25:31.725
You too.

1:26:49.305 --> 1:26:50.704
Sam, you know, I just...

1:26:52.608 --> 1:26:56.276
We've known each other
for four days.
Four days, eight states.

1:26:56.278 --> 1:26:58.512
Is it eight states?
Eight states.

1:26:58.514 --> 1:27:00.681
We've known each other
for four days and eight states.

1:27:00.683 --> 1:27:02.616
I'd like to know you
for more days.

1:27:03.719 --> 1:27:08.455
All the days,
because, you know, I
really like-- that's stupid.

1:27:10.259 --> 1:27:13.560
The-- Sam, the road

1:27:14.296 --> 1:27:17.364
to Le Chateau Paradis,
it's so bumpy.

1:27:22.338 --> 1:27:23.403
Sam?

1:27:23.772 --> 1:27:25.239
It's got eight.

1:27:48.764 --> 1:27:50.530
I'm gonna need
a little help getting over.

1:27:52.434 --> 1:27:53.500
I'll get someone.

1:28:04.680 --> 1:28:05.812
Does it bother you?

1:28:07.516 --> 1:28:08.582
The chair?

1:28:09.818 --> 1:28:11.685
My brother has.

1:28:13.455 --> 1:28:14.755
Your brother's in a wheelchair?

1:28:17.593 --> 1:28:20.560
It means I understand.

1:28:45.721 --> 1:28:46.787
Wait, wait.

1:28:48.857 --> 1:28:50.857
I'm sorry, can you just, um...

1:28:52.528 --> 1:28:55.395
tell me something about you?

1:28:55.397 --> 1:28:59.733
-Uh, y-you want me to...
-Tell me something.
Just anything.

1:29:00.402 --> 1:29:01.468
Like, uh,

1:29:03.339 --> 1:29:04.538
what kind of music do you like.

1:29:05.607 --> 1:29:06.840
You know Garou?

1:29:07.576 --> 1:29:09.943
-Ga--
-Ga-Garou, no?

1:29:11.647 --> 1:29:14.348
It's okay. Just forget it.
That was stupid.

1:29:20.422 --> 1:29:24.391
¶ <i> Happy birthday to you </i> ¶

1:29:27.763 --> 1:29:31.531
¶ <i> Happy birthday to you </i> ¶

1:29:33.102 --> 1:29:37.738
¶ <i> Happy birthday</i>
<i> Dear Scotty </i> ¶

1:29:40.743 --> 1:29:42.909
¶ <i> Happy birthday </i> ¶

1:29:44.613 --> 1:29:45.679
¶ <i> To </i> ¶

1:29:46.782 --> 1:29:47.848
¶ <i> You </i> ¶

1:30:45.441 --> 1:30:46.573
To the new couple.

1:30:47.443 --> 1:30:48.809
-Ew, don't.
-Stop it.

1:30:48.811 --> 1:30:50.744
And the brothel
that brought them together.

1:30:50.746 --> 1:30:54.448
-Easy.
-Just chill out.
We're just having fun.

1:30:54.850 --> 1:30:56.016
I have a question.

1:30:57.586 --> 1:31:00.854
Forget any disabilities.

1:31:01.790 --> 1:31:04.524
Forget anything
that might be holding you back.

1:31:06.962 --> 1:31:08.762
What would you wanna
do with your life?

1:31:10.699 --> 1:31:11.765
Anyone?

1:31:19.608 --> 1:31:21.508
Before my surgery,
I was a boxer.

1:31:24.012 --> 1:31:25.912
Really wanted to turn pro.

1:31:30.552 --> 1:31:32.786
But as long as I get
to retire by the beach,

1:31:34.256 --> 1:31:35.522
I'm good.

1:31:40.963 --> 1:31:42.028
Mo?

1:31:43.899 --> 1:31:45.599
Uhm--

1:31:48.737 --> 1:31:51.771
Honestly, I
just always wanted to be a dad.

1:31:52.241 --> 1:31:54.841
Though I will say, I do,
when I have kids, I want to...

1:31:55.711 --> 1:32:01.515
like coach them in baseball,
and then we'd like move up
together, like...

1:32:02.584 --> 1:32:05.919
in Little League and then
maybe like middle school,
high school, I don't know.

1:32:06.989 --> 1:32:08.922
Maybe we'll all go pro together.

1:32:12.928 --> 1:32:14.027
Scotty?

1:32:14.796 --> 1:32:17.731
[sighs] I don't know. Skip me.

1:32:17.733 --> 1:32:19.666
-What? No.
-[Sam] We're not skipping you.

1:32:19.668 --> 1:32:21.735
-No, I don't wanna say.
-Come on.

1:32:21.737 --> 1:32:23.270
-[Sam] We're all going.
-[Mo] It's not fair.

1:32:23.272 --> 1:32:24.838
You can't do that.
We're not gonna make fun of you.

1:32:24.840 --> 1:32:26.806
-[Mo] We wanna know.
-[Sam] Yeah, no.

1:32:26.808 --> 1:32:28.675
Sam, how about you?

1:32:33.882 --> 1:32:36.850
Well, I always wanted
to be an artist.

1:32:37.786 --> 1:32:40.887
But I didn't think it was
a very realistic path,

1:32:40.889 --> 1:32:43.657
so I went to nursing school,

1:32:44.326 --> 1:32:49.095
which turned out
to be perfect because I...

1:32:50.899 --> 1:32:54.834
I really love feeling needed.

1:32:57.906 --> 1:32:58.972
So...

1:32:58.974 --> 1:33:05.912
I am exactly where I wanna be
at this very second.

1:33:06.915 --> 1:33:09.749
[sex sounds]

1:33:11.053 --> 1:33:12.586
You feel any different?

1:33:17.059 --> 1:33:18.592
Not really. You?

1:33:21.630 --> 1:33:23.730
I thought it was gonna be
this monumental shift.

1:33:24.099 --> 1:33:25.699
Yeah, me too.

1:33:30.939 --> 1:33:32.772
Feel a little empty, actually.

1:33:33.141 --> 1:33:37.010
Like the whole thing made me
want something...

1:33:38.080 --> 1:33:42.949
more, something that doesn't
just end abruptly.

1:33:48.690 --> 1:33:49.889
I hope you find that person.

1:33:55.697 --> 1:33:57.764
Hey, can you promise me
something when we head back?

1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:01.635
I just want you to find
a stage, get on it,

1:34:02.371 --> 1:34:05.872
grab a mic,
you wreck it, just once.

1:34:05.874 --> 1:34:08.942
No, man.
Dude, when you look like I do,

1:34:08.944 --> 1:34:10.777
you want less eyes on you,
not more.

1:34:11.146 --> 1:34:14.180
-Besides I would suck.
-Well, what are they
gonna say to you?

1:34:15.984 --> 1:34:17.117
They're not gonna boo you.

1:34:18.153 --> 1:34:19.252
You're in a chair.

1:34:25.060 --> 1:34:26.009
One condition.

1:34:26.010 --> 1:34:26.959
You gotta be up
on that stage with me.

1:34:30.999 --> 1:34:32.065
Mm-hmm.

1:34:33.402 --> 1:34:34.668
Deal.

1:34:56.892 --> 1:34:57.957
Matt?

1:35:18.947 --> 1:35:20.113
Matt?

1:35:34.262 --> 1:35:35.328
Matt.

1:35:41.970 --> 1:35:43.036
Matt!

1:35:59.521 --> 1:36:01.254
Matt!

1:36:32.254 --> 1:36:39.125
I'll miss you for teaching me
math, but I won't miss you
for hogging the bathroom.

1:36:41.229 --> 1:36:44.197
I'm so happy
that you were my big brother,

1:36:44.199 --> 1:36:47.200
and I'll miss you
forever and ever.

1:36:52.007 --> 1:36:56.009
The family wanted to have
an opportunity for anyone
not on the program

1:36:56.011 --> 1:36:58.878
who may feel called
to share a few words.

1:37:01.082 --> 1:37:04.284
-Okay, let's move on to--
-[Scotty] We do.

1:37:43.892 --> 1:37:46.960
Down a little bit.
Less. Yeah, right there.

1:37:47.863 --> 1:37:51.631
Left, left.
That's-- Whatever.

1:37:51.633 --> 1:37:53.399
Uh, so I'm Scotty,

1:37:54.302 --> 1:37:56.002
and I'm here because...

1:37:56.638 --> 1:37:59.138
I promised Matt
that I'd do something, and...

1:37:59.140 --> 1:38:02.008
I don't want him
coming back to haunt my ass
because I blew it off.

1:38:03.078 --> 1:38:06.246
My only condition was
that he be up here
with me when I do this.

1:38:08.283 --> 1:38:10.149
Guess it's now or never,
home slice.

1:38:11.152 --> 1:38:12.218
Hit it.

1:38:14.089 --> 1:38:17.123
[music playing]

1:38:20.161 --> 1:38:22.262
Clap your hands everybody.

1:38:23.331 --> 1:38:25.231
We're here to celebrate a life.

1:38:26.401 --> 1:38:27.467
I tried.

1:38:31.106 --> 1:38:33.406

1:40:54.182 --> 1:40:55.765
[Scotty] Uh, drop the mic, Mo.

1:40:55.766 --> 1:40:57.349
No, drop it. Mo, drop the mic,
it's gangster.

1:40:57.352 --> 1:40:58.484
Yeah, yeah.

1:41:19.841 --> 1:41:21.174
[Sarah] Hey, Scotty.

1:41:25.346 --> 1:41:27.480
I'm really sorry
to hear about Matt.

1:41:28.216 --> 1:41:29.482
That's so awful.

1:41:29.484 --> 1:41:32.351
I mean, I didn't really even
know that he was sick.

1:41:33.288 --> 1:41:34.353
Thanks.

1:41:38.126 --> 1:41:40.426
Other than that,
the trip was pretty awesome.

1:41:40.428 --> 1:41:42.195
You know what they say:
It ain't a real bro's trip

1:41:42.197 --> 1:41:44.163
unless somebody comes back
in a body bag.

1:41:46.868 --> 1:41:49.302
-It's a thing.
-Oh, no, I've heard that.

1:41:49.304 --> 1:41:50.403
Yeah.

1:41:51.106 --> 1:41:55.308
[inaudible] Keep going.
Keep going.

1:41:59.848 --> 1:42:01.414
Hey, so, um,

1:42:01.416 --> 1:42:07.520
I was gonna check out
this rapper over
at the Bluebird on Friday night,

1:42:08.590 --> 1:42:10.690
if you wanted to come with.

1:42:12.193 --> 1:42:14.894
Or not.
It's no biggie either way.

1:42:14.895 --> 1:42:17.596
I actually can't
on Friday night.
I'm so sorry. I have a thing.

1:42:23.605 --> 1:42:24.637
Oh.

1:42:24.638 --> 1:42:25.670
But, Scotty,
what about Saturday night?

1:42:26.908 --> 1:42:28.274
Maybe just like dinner.

1:42:29.210 --> 1:42:30.276
Dinner.

1:42:30.912 --> 1:42:32.211
Like a date.

1:42:32.213 --> 1:42:33.546
Yeah, like a date.

1:42:36.518 --> 1:42:37.550
Okay.

1:42:41.489 --> 1:42:42.588
Cool.

1:43:00.508 --> 1:43:04.710
<i> And they were going on</i>
<i> a trip to get-- Asta,</i>
<i> well, how shall we put it?</i>

1:43:04.712 --> 1:43:07.947
<i> Prostitutes. Asta,</i>
<i> so what was the trip about?</i>

1:43:07.949 --> 1:43:12.485
<i> The road trip was about me</i>
<i> experiencing</i>

1:43:12.487 --> 1:43:15.321
<i> what the sexual</i>
<i> side was in Holland.</i>

1:43:15.323 --> 1:43:20.660
<i> And obviously</i>
<i> the government helped people</i>
<i> with disabilities out there</i>

1:43:20.662 --> 1:43:23.663
<i> to have a sexual experience.</i>
<i> I was like, "Wow, I've gotta</i>
<i> go see this."</i>

1:43:23.665 --> 1:43:26.199
<i>And was that the first time you</i>
<i> had had sexual relations?</i>

1:43:26.201 --> 1:43:29.702
<i> Absolutely, yeah.</i>
<i> So, for me it was</i>
<i> just completely mind blowing.</i>

1:43:29.704 --> 1:43:32.505
<i> And you were like,</i>
<i> "Oh, this is what people</i>
<i> have been talking about?</i>

1:43:32.506 --> 1:43:35.307
<i> -Okay, I can get behind this."</i>
<i> -The parents or caregivers</i>
<i> don't even realize</i>

1:43:35.310 --> 1:43:37.577
<i> that they have a need</i>
<i> for sexual experience</i>

1:43:37.579 --> 1:43:40.279
<i> and that's what I want</i>
<i> to help with.</i>
<i> When you are in a situation</i>

1:43:40.281 --> 1:43:44.383
<i> where you're in a wheelchair</i>
<i> and you're getting judged</i>
<i> every day from society,</i>

1:43:44.385 --> 1:43:49.488
<i> then it's hard for--</i>
<i> I don't see how someone</i>
<i> who hasn't even been</i>

1:43:49.490 --> 1:43:51.524
<i> in that arena,</i>
<i> could come up to me and say,</i>

1:43:51.526 --> 1:43:54.227
<i> "Well, why don't you just go</i>
<i> out and get your own</i>
<i> girlfriend, man?"</i>

1:43:54.229 --> 1:43:57.430
<i> -It's just like--</i>
<i> -Easy to say, yeah.</i>
<i> Kiss my ass, you know.</i>

1:43:57.432 --> 1:44:00.433
<i> Somebody says,</i>
<i>"Oh, no, no. You're not allowed</i>
<i> to have that kind of fun."</i>

1:44:00.435 --> 1:44:03.603
<i> Okay, and I have a few words</i>
<i> for them, "Piss off!"</i>
