We got a honeymoon to start!

Uh, wasn't me.
Not like I was packing lingerie.

He knows what he bought.

00:12.780 --> 00:16.350
And I lost the receipt,
so I guess I'm stuck with it.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.219
I can't believe you guys
are going together.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.754
Well, Ben found
a great deal,

00:20.788 --> 00:23.557
and better a double honeymoon
than no honeymoon.

00:23.591 --> 00:24.492
Hm.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.826
Maybe.

No. No. You know what?
It's gonna be great.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.930
I-I did a lot of work
on myself this year,

00:29.963 --> 00:31.332
and I'm gonna be positive.

Feels wrong,
makes me kinda sweaty,

00:32.800 --> 00:34.168
but I'm gonna do it.

00:34.202 --> 00:37.538
Anyway,
here's where we're going.

00:37.571 --> 00:41.542
It's a lovely two-bedroom cabin
on the lake near the dunes.

00:41.575 --> 00:42.710
There's no reception.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.212
Oh.
Fine by me.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.180
The only signal I need
is right here,

00:46.214 --> 00:48.582
and it is flashing green.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.919
This is so weird.

00:51.952 --> 00:55.689

a honeymoon with my Aunt Jackie.

That's sweet.

you'd be going on a honeymoon.

supposed to mean?

No, no. I-It's great.
It's great.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.201
Just -- Just kind of
a shocker, right?

01:07.235 --> 01:08.702
I mean,
even you've got to admit

01:08.736 --> 01:10.438
your romantic life's
been kind of a dumpster fire.

01:10.471 --> 01:14.041
Ben: [ Chuckles ] Right?
I mean, holy cow.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.776
You couldn't make
a relationship work

01:15.809 --> 01:17.611
if you gave it a salary
and a company car.

You've got Neville and whatever
brain-eating cow virus

that's making him love you!

That's funny! Yeah!

01:36.330 --> 01:38.299
Aunt Jackie finally
trapped herself a man,

01:38.332 --> 01:40.000
but he's only got part
of his brain.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.570
So if he tries to run away,
he'll just go in circles.

Oh, we're all gonna be out
of town at the same time,

the security system.

Harris, do you realize
this is one of the last times

02:29.850 --> 02:31.385
we'll ever share a room?

02:31.419 --> 02:32.786
'Cause at Mom's new place,
we each have our own.

Yeah. About that.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.990
Mom, I know we planned
on me moving in,

if I don't live with you.

Hey, you know what? It's okay.
You don't owe me.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.464
But when you were little,

02:43.497 --> 02:45.533
you wandered off into the park
a couple times.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.868
I set my coffee down
and went looking for you.

a place together.

You're like a daughter

But I just can't afford it
right now.

No, no. It's not that.

either.

Is there another Grandpa

I promised my Louise
privacy.

You said
I was always welcome here.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.968
That's when you said
you were leaving.

when she comes off the road.

It's not her fault.
I was gonna do it anyway.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.443
She was just trying to be
a friend.

18:30.477 --> 18:33.146
Wow. Sticking up for each other.
That's new.

18:34.947 --> 18:38.151
Okay.
This one time, all right?

18:38.185 --> 18:39.519
You're still grounded
for two weeks,

18:39.552 --> 18:40.687
but you can have
the phone.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.322
But this better never happen
again, okay?

18:42.355 --> 18:45.358
Thank you.
Can we go listen to music?

18:45.392 --> 18:47.794
There's an album
I want to throw up to.

18:51.198 --> 18:54.167
That's it?
That's all you're gonna do?

18:54.201 --> 18:56.269
Are you sure you don't want to
buy him a bottle of wine

18:56.303 --> 18:58.338
to celebrate
their new friendship?

18:58.371 --> 19:00.340
There's a bigger picture here,
Becky.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.342
They finally have
a relationship.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.511
If that took a couple of drinks
one time

19:04.544 --> 19:06.379
to get that to happen,
then so be it.

19:06.413 --> 19:09.148
**

19:09.182 --> 19:11.318
Hey.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.520
What are you doing back
so soon?

19:13.553 --> 19:16.523
Um, after you left, they
found out the loft was empty,

19:16.556 --> 19:18.358
and they booked somebody else
into it.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.662
But I brought some stuff
you guys left.

19:22.695 --> 19:23.996
Sweater.
Toothbrush.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.032
Oh, and your
prudish attitude

19:26.065 --> 19:29.469
about making love
in the same room as a relative.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.304
Why were you trying
so hard

19:31.338 --> 19:33.673
to prove that you're
a better couple than us?

19:33.706 --> 19:36.343
How can you even ask me that
after all the hurtful things

19:36.376 --> 19:38.345
you said about me going
on a honeymoon

19:38.378 --> 19:40.213
and how nobody would ever
want to be with me?

19:40.247 --> 19:42.215
That's how the Conners
show love.

19:42.249 --> 19:45.051
We find each other's emotional
wounds and we pour salt in.

19:45.084 --> 19:47.153
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
No. I know all that.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.589
Aunt Jackie's a lunatic.
Aunt Jackie's a screw-up.

19:49.622 --> 19:53.025
How could Aunt Jackie ever find
somebody to love her?

19:53.059 --> 19:55.695
I've dealt with those issues
my whole life.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.030
I don't need to hear it from you
and the rest of the family.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.466
I deserve better.

20:02.469 --> 20:03.570
You do.

20:05.104 --> 20:08.441
Maybe I just saw how happy
you and Neville were

20:08.475 --> 20:10.377
from the moment
you got together.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.779
You know, Ben and I had
so many ups and downs

20:12.812 --> 20:14.914
before we got married,
and I guess I just...

20:14.947 --> 20:17.049
felt a little insecure.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.419
Well, maybe I did try
a little too hard

20:19.452 --> 20:23.456
to -- to show that Neville and I
are crazy in love.

20:23.490 --> 20:24.691
Yep.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.359
[ Chuckles ]

20:26.393 --> 20:30.763
Well, it was a long road
to healthy relationships

20:30.797 --> 20:32.765
for both of us,
but hey, we made it!

20:32.799 --> 20:34.534
Yeah, we did.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.969
[ Laughs ]

20:37.003 --> 20:40.573
All right.
So be real with me.

20:40.607 --> 20:44.577
Were you guys really going at it
for an hour,

20:44.611 --> 20:46.713
or were you just making noises
to impress us?

20:46.746 --> 20:48.881
Actually, it was longer.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.418
I put a pillow over his face
for the first part,

20:51.451 --> 20:54.020
but that was just partially
for your benefit.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.490
Uh, j--
My fault for asking.

20:57.524 --> 20:58.458
Okay.
We can...

21:02.161 --> 21:04.230
Why do I have to wash
the car now?

21:04.263 --> 21:07.199
My head is killing me.
That's exactly why.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.307
How you feeling,
buddy?!

21:14.341 --> 21:16.309
Don't do that.
[ Laughs ]

21:16.343 --> 21:17.910
Ben, cut him a break.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.112
Mark, this might
make you feel better.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.915
It's one of those funny videos
of the goats that you like.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.184
