WEBVTT

00:01.904 --> 00:02.904
Previously on The O.C.

00:02.944 --> 00:04.584
You're not exactly the ideal client.

00:04.584 --> 00:05.624
Rich, powerful...

00:05.624 --> 00:06.264
Guilty...

00:06.264 --> 00:08.384
Guess who no longer works
for Partridge, Savage & Caan?

00:08.424 --> 00:09.984
- You quit?
- Or got fired.

00:09.984 --> 00:10.744
Ryan Atwood?

00:10.784 --> 00:11.464
Lindsay Gardner.

00:11.584 --> 00:14.184
I owe you an apology.
I'm sorry.

00:14.464 --> 00:15.144
Me too.

00:15.664 --> 00:18.504
We agreed we wouldn't tell anyone
because you could get fired.

00:18.544 --> 00:20.384
You know what? I quit.

00:20.464 --> 00:21.304
As of tomorrow morning,

00:21.304 --> 00:24.624
Julie will be the new chief executive
officer of the Newport Group.

00:24.704 --> 00:26.464
Maybe I can't be just friends with you.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.584
I guess maybe this is it for us.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:45.864 --> 00:46.944
So, you're saying you won't help me?

00:47.024 --> 00:48.544
I got a physics quiz; I'm kind of busy.

00:48.584 --> 00:51.184
Ryan, please, man.
This is a crisis, okay?

00:51.224 --> 00:53.184
Zack and Summer--
they're full-on dating now.

00:53.184 --> 00:54.744
That means I need
a new girlfriend, pronto.

00:54.744 --> 00:56.344
So, you're going to start dating someone
just to show up Summer?

00:56.384 --> 00:57.784
There's other reasons.

00:57.824 --> 01:00.224
I can't think of them right now.
Listen, hold on a second.

01:00.264 --> 01:01.744
Let's break bread,
let's discuss broads.

01:01.904 --> 01:04.384
Oh! My graphing calculator.
I left it in your room.

01:04.504 --> 01:05.824
You know what else is in my room?

01:05.904 --> 01:07.624
What? What is in your room?

01:07.824 --> 01:10.664
My yearbook, full of new ideas
for fresh-faced loved ones.

01:10.704 --> 01:13.024
What do you say we whittle down the list
to, like, 20 finalists, by homeroom?

01:13.064 --> 01:14.064
That's a bad idea.

01:14.064 --> 01:15.064
And you can keep my leftovers.

01:15.064 --> 01:16.664
No, thanks. I'm not dating this year;
that's the game plan.

01:16.664 --> 01:17.424
- Yes, you are.
- Nope.

01:17.504 --> 01:19.464
You absolutely are.
I'm not entering this new era alone.

01:19.744 --> 01:20.664
It is a new era.

01:20.704 --> 01:22.784
Getting the ax is the best thing
that could have happened to me.

01:22.784 --> 01:25.824
Now the only person I answer to is me.

01:25.864 --> 01:26.904
And my father.

01:26.944 --> 01:27.544
Ah!

01:27.704 --> 01:31.264
All I'm saying is that
he's your only client. Isn't he?

01:31.264 --> 01:32.944
Yeah.
And you work for his wife.

01:32.984 --> 01:35.024
What was your father thinking?

01:35.704 --> 01:36.744
Well, you can ask him.

01:36.784 --> 01:38.464
You'll be hanging with him all day.

01:38.504 --> 01:41.264
If I can win this case,
get my practice off the ground...

01:41.304 --> 01:45.384
You can spend your entire career
defending my father's rich clients.

01:45.584 --> 01:47.304
You're not bringing me down, honey.

01:47.304 --> 01:48.384
Look, you heard Seth.

01:48.864 --> 01:50.344
It's a new era.

01:50.384 --> 01:52.864
Sure is, Father, and guess what?
I think I found a new girlfriend.

01:53.104 --> 01:53.864
Here in the kitchen?

01:53.904 --> 01:56.544
Ah, no, in the new era. Seth shops
for girlfriends in the yearbook.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.664
Tina Woo,
member of the a cappella group

01:58.664 --> 02:02.184
co-President of the improv
team Shenanigans.

02:02.224 --> 02:04.624
She's musical, she's witty.
Hopefully she's free for lunch.

02:04.664 --> 02:05.784
Dude, "Shenanigans"?

02:05.784 --> 02:06.384
I know.

02:06.384 --> 02:08.584
Are you sure you're ready
to start dating, sweetie,

02:08.584 --> 02:10.184
I mean after everything you've
been through with Summer?

02:10.264 --> 02:12.384
What, better he should mope?
Don't listen to them.

02:12.744 --> 02:15.424
If it was up to your mother, I'd still
be working at Patridge, Savage & Caan,

02:15.464 --> 02:17.264
coming home bitching
about high-priced lawsuits.

02:17.264 --> 02:21.344
Totally. Ryan, would you rather I go for
the Woo, or keep talking about Summer?

02:24.144 --> 02:25.264
Here's to the new era.

02:25.304 --> 02:26.944
Amen.

02:57.231 --> 02:59.751
All right, so the Tina Woo thing
didn't happen. Just move on.

02:59.951 --> 03:03.231
You know, a simple "no"
from the Woo would have been sufficient.

03:03.711 --> 03:06.071
I think the added laughter
was just unnecessary.

03:06.151 --> 03:06.871
Hey !

03:07.751 --> 03:08.551
what about her?

03:08.591 --> 03:10.791
Tiffany Rosenberg?
No, we have a history.

03:11.791 --> 03:14.991
Third grade, uh,
class field trip to SeaWorld.

03:15.271 --> 03:17.791
I tried to sort of talk to the dolphins,

03:17.791 --> 03:20.831
she overheard, there was taunting.
It was really bad.

03:20.871 --> 03:22.831
Bus ride home was a low point.

03:22.991 --> 03:25.351
How about I point out a girl, and you
tell me whether or not you'd date her?

03:25.471 --> 03:26.871
How about I tell you whether
or not she would date me?

03:26.871 --> 03:29.751
Yeah, exactly.
Uh, that one right there.

03:29.831 --> 03:32.271
Uh, yeah... and no.

03:32.391 --> 03:33.871
No?

03:34.991 --> 03:36.551
Uh, no. Yeah.

03:36.591 --> 03:37.471
Yeah?

03:37.511 --> 03:39.831
Are you shopping for
girlfriends in the quad?

03:39.871 --> 03:41.351
- No.
- Yeah.

03:41.751 --> 03:44.591
Classy... and not remotely demeaning.

03:44.631 --> 03:46.911
Uh, Lindsay, Seth,
Seth, Lindsay.

03:46.951 --> 03:48.351
Oh. Hey.

03:48.391 --> 03:49.631
So, how does this work?

03:49.671 --> 03:53.311
Is there a ranking system, or is each
girl judged on her individual merits?

03:53.431 --> 03:55.791
And by merits,
I mean her rack and/or ass.

03:55.991 --> 03:57.391
It's a simple yes-no survey.

03:57.431 --> 03:58.631
Yes-no survey.

03:58.671 --> 04:04.151
I see. Well, in that case, no... and no.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.911
I'll see you in class.

04:08.991 --> 04:10.631
I can't believe I finally met her.

04:10.671 --> 04:12.111
- What, Lindsay?
- Lindsay Cohen.

04:12.151 --> 04:14.431
It's got a nice ring to it. Don't you
think? Will you hook that up for me?

04:14.551 --> 04:15.111
No.

04:15.111 --> 04:17.190
Why not? Unless, hey, do you,
I mean, do you like her?

04:17.591 --> 04:20.951
Oh, n-n-no, no, it's just, she's,
she's argumentative, bossy, difficult.

04:20.951 --> 04:21.991
Yeah,  that's my type.

04:22.111 --> 04:23.391
Believe me, you should hold out
for something else.

04:23.471 --> 04:24.271
No, absolutely not.

04:24.271 --> 04:26.711
I need that one, and I need you
to make that happen for me, okay?

04:26.831 --> 04:29.271
Can you make it happen?
Can you hook me up? Hook a brother up?

04:29.391 --> 04:29.991
I could hook it up.

04:30.231 --> 04:32.711
That's  what I like to hear. Thank you.

04:34.431 --> 04:36.031
This is a new era, Summer.

04:36.071 --> 04:38.991
For the first time in my life,
I have, like, no boy drama.

04:39.031 --> 04:42.511
That is not possible.
You are a magnet for boy drama.

04:42.671 --> 04:45.471
I'm serious. Ryan and I--
just friends.

04:45.511 --> 04:47.471
Mmm. And DJ?

04:48.071 --> 04:49.991
What, with the deltoids
and the trapezoids?

04:49.991 --> 04:52.551
He wants nothing to do with me.

04:52.591 --> 04:53.631
Well, did you apologize?

04:54.151 --> 04:55.271
I have no idea where he is.

04:56.151 --> 04:59.231
After he quit working for my parents,
he went totally MIA.

04:59.271 --> 05:01.671
He can't be that hard to find.
Doesn't he work for the Hendersons?

05:02.471 --> 05:04.831
See? Totally addicted to boy drama.

05:04.871 --> 05:05.791
Like you don't have issues.

05:05.871 --> 05:08.271
Actually, right now,
my love life is totally trauma-free.

05:08.271 --> 05:10.031
So, lunch went well
with Zack and your dad?

05:10.071 --> 05:15.111
Amazing. None of that manic Cohen chatter
or that incomprehensible Cohen mumbling.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.271
If Cohen is the virus, Zack is the cure.

05:17.311 --> 05:18.711
He is the anti-Cohen.

05:18.751 --> 05:19.631
Hmm.

05:19.991 --> 05:20.911
Speak of the devil.

05:20.951 --> 05:21.671
Cohen?

05:21.671 --> 05:22.111
Zack.

05:22.111 --> 05:23.791
Right. Great. Better. Hey!

05:23.791 --> 05:24.471
Hi.

05:24.511 --> 05:26.551
Oh. That's a firm hug.

05:26.591 --> 05:28.031
Sorry, Ducky.

05:28.271 --> 05:29.551
Ducky?

05:29.791 --> 05:31.471
We have nicknames.

05:31.911 --> 05:33.151
We do?

05:33.391 --> 05:34.391
Yes.

05:34.391 --> 05:37.071
"Ducky." That's, that's cute.

05:37.071 --> 05:39.631
So, anyways, Ducky,
Marissa here is totally bumming out

05:39.631 --> 05:42.271
because she doesn't have anyone
in her life as perfect as you.

05:42.311 --> 05:43.351
Thanks, Summ.

05:43.391 --> 05:46.271
Well, I know lots of eligible bachelors.
You want me to set you up?

05:46.311 --> 05:47.991
Oh, no. That's okay.
Really, I'm fine.

05:51.431 --> 05:53.911
You know, this is the start
of a new era for us, Sandman.

05:54.871 --> 05:56.871
Working together
on the same side of the law,

05:56.911 --> 05:59.671
overcoming our differences,
battling the odds.

05:59.751 --> 06:01.111
Bringing a tear to my eye, Cal.

06:01.471 --> 06:03.671
Now, let's talk about what we know
at this point in the game.

06:03.711 --> 06:04.951
You hungry?

06:04.991 --> 06:07.871
They do a delicious frittata here.
You a frittata man?

06:07.911 --> 06:08.471
I'm fine.

06:08.511 --> 06:11.511
Now, you've been funneling money
every month to a trust.

06:11.671 --> 06:12.951
And the person who runs this trust

06:12.951 --> 06:15.391
happens to be an associate
of the city councilman's office,

06:15.391 --> 06:17.111
the same city councilman

06:17.111 --> 06:21.031
that issues building permits
to people who build lots of buildings.

06:22.511 --> 06:23.311
People like you.

06:23.351 --> 06:24.831
I do build lots of buildings.

06:24.871 --> 06:26.071
I've done very well for myself.

06:26.151 --> 06:28.071
Started off with nothing,

06:28.551 --> 06:31.591
and still I strive for more.
Never satisfied.

06:32.271 --> 06:33.831
What do they call that?

06:33.951 --> 06:34.671
Greed.

06:34.751 --> 06:36.991
Now, as you can see, on the face of it,

06:37.831 --> 06:38.911
this looks like bribery.

06:38.951 --> 06:41.951
What about a round of drinks, huh?
What do you say, huh? Manhattans?

06:41.951 --> 06:46.311
It's 10:00 a.m. Now focus.
Why did you set up the trust?

06:46.351 --> 06:48.151
Charity, tax benefits...

06:48.151 --> 06:51.031
What about the woman who runs
the trust : Renee Wheeler.

06:51.071 --> 06:51.991
I don't know her.

06:52.031 --> 06:53.431
You're very grumpy today.

06:53.471 --> 06:56.751
I think it's 'cause you're hungry.
Frittata coming right up.

06:56.791 --> 07:00.311
The D.A. wants you to spend
your twilight years in a 5-by-9 cell,

07:00.391 --> 07:01.991
and all you can think about are frittatas.

07:01.991 --> 07:03.551
No one is going to jail.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.951
This thing won't even make it to court.

07:08.311 --> 07:09.191
Phyllis.

07:09.271 --> 07:09.991
Phyllis?

07:10.031 --> 07:13.431
Yeah. My-my old secretary.
She retired three years ago.

07:13.511 --> 07:15.151
She set up the trust.

07:15.471 --> 07:16.951
You couldn't have told
me this on the phone?

07:16.991 --> 07:18.191
Then I wouldn't have gotten to see you.

07:18.191 --> 07:19.511
Let's get you that frittata.

07:19.511 --> 07:21.031
Excuse me.

07:38.471 --> 07:39.311
You're lurking.

07:39.351 --> 07:41.631
Right. Sorry.
Um...

07:44.191 --> 07:47.271
Look, uh, for all I know,
you have a boyfriend,

07:47.311 --> 07:49.511
so there's no point
in me even asking you...

07:49.551 --> 07:53.071
I don't...  Um,
I don't have a boyfriend.

07:53.391 --> 07:54.071
Oh, you don't?

07:54.111 --> 07:55.551
Yeah. Don't rub it in.

07:55.631 --> 08:00.871
Right. Well, I was wondering
if you would maybe want to...

08:01.591 --> 08:06.031
maybe, a-and feel free to say no...
go out on a date.

08:06.191 --> 08:07.951
Okay. Sure.

08:08.231 --> 08:09.391
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:09.551 --> 08:11.951
Uh,  great, so you'll go out with Seth?

08:11.991 --> 08:13.431
Wh-what?

08:13.471 --> 08:14.831
Yeah, you'll go on a date with Seth?

08:14.871 --> 08:16.631
Yes. Uh, Seth...

08:16.671 --> 08:23.631
You want me to go out with Seth,
and I said, "yes," so, yes.

08:23.631 --> 08:26.991
Great.
Great... great.

08:27.271 --> 08:28.751
-  You sure?
- I am positive.

08:28.751 --> 08:30.551
Tomorrow night.
The sooner the better, right?

08:30.591 --> 08:32.791
Right. Yeah.

08:34.071 --> 08:35.791
Uh, thanks.

08:48.111 --> 08:50.271
Look who has a new ficus.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.791
Oh. I-I have a ton of work to do.

08:53.911 --> 08:54.671
If, if you could...

08:54.551 --> 08:55.631
I figure now that I'm in charge,

08:55.631 --> 08:57.991
I could introduce
a little more life into this place.

08:58.271 --> 09:01.551
You know, a ficus here, an orchid there,
next thing you know, we are...

09:01.591 --> 09:02.591
A rain forest.

09:02.631 --> 09:03.631
Thanks for the plant,

09:03.631 --> 09:07.671
but right now, this company is one
failed deal away from total ruin,

09:07.671 --> 09:10.151
which means I have to ficus, uh, focus..

09:10.151 --> 09:11.151
Ficus, focus.

09:11.191 --> 09:13.071
Oh, honey, you are all over the place.

09:13.071 --> 09:14.791
But no need to worry. The boss is here.

09:14.831 --> 09:16.471
Let me lighten your load.

09:16.711 --> 09:18.471
What are you reading?

09:20.271 --> 09:21.871
Budget projections for next year.

09:21.871 --> 09:23.351
It's, uh, it's very dense.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.831
Which you think I am: dense.

09:25.871 --> 09:28.431
No. Uh, Julie, no.

09:29.711 --> 09:32.191
Look, the key to good
leadership is delegation,

09:32.231 --> 09:35.231
so why don't you delegate this kind
of stuff to me so that you're free to...

09:35.271 --> 09:36.231
Continue being stupid?

09:36.231 --> 09:37.911
Julie, all I'm saying ...

09:37.911 --> 09:40.951
.... is that we have an extremely
important presentation tomorrow.

09:41.071 --> 09:42.151
Yes.

09:42.231 --> 09:45.751
Clearly I have a lot of reading up to do
so I can be ready for the presentation.

09:45.791 --> 09:49.391
You know, running this company is about
more than just plant life, Kirsten.

09:49.431 --> 09:52.311
Even you should know that.

10:08.711 --> 10:09.431
Hey.

10:10.791 --> 10:13.631
I saw your truck,
and I thought I'd stop by and say hi.

10:13.831 --> 10:15.031
How are you?

10:15.191 --> 10:16.151
Busy.

10:16.231 --> 10:17.951
Right.

10:19.031 --> 10:20.671
Well, you can't be busy
all weekend long.

10:20.671 --> 10:22.591
The Killers are playing tomorrow night,
and they're really good.

10:22.991 --> 10:24.591
So, what, are we friends now?

10:24.631 --> 10:28.031
Judging by this conversation,
probably not.

10:28.911 --> 10:33.031
But I'd really like to try...
and be something.

10:33.071 --> 10:34.671
And how does your boyfriend
feel about that?

10:34.671 --> 10:35.791
He's not my boyfriend.

10:35.831 --> 10:38.711
Well, I guess that explains
what you're doing here talking to me.

10:39.311 --> 10:41.311
When you and I...

10:42.831 --> 10:44.631
I didn't know Ryan was coming back.

10:44.671 --> 10:46.431
I'm glad I could help you kill time
until he did.

10:46.471 --> 10:49.431
You know that's not what it was.

10:54.231 --> 10:55.951
Bait Shop, tomorrow night.

10:56.151 --> 10:57.551
I'll be there if you decide to stop by.

11:05.031 --> 11:07.031
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:07.471 --> 11:09.911
I think all this manual labor
is affecting my bod.

11:09.991 --> 11:11.671
I seem tougher to you?

11:11.751 --> 11:13.751
You don't want me to answer that.

11:14.511 --> 11:17.711
Hey, so, guess what.
You have a date tomorrow.

11:17.951 --> 11:19.111
I do? With who?

11:19.151 --> 11:20.951
Lindsay, the future Mrs. Seth Cohen.

11:21.671 --> 11:25.191
No. Man, I said I wanted to marry her,
not date her, okay?

11:25.191 --> 11:27.271
I didn't really think she would say yes.
This changes everything.

11:27.391 --> 11:28.271
Well,  I'm not getting you out of it.

11:28.271 --> 11:30.191
Well, I'm not going...

11:30.791 --> 11:33.631
unless you go with me.
I will do that.

11:33.631 --> 11:35.871
What, you want me to go with you
on your date as what, your chaperone?

11:35.911 --> 11:37.071
No. We'll double.
I'll set you up.

11:37.111 --> 11:37.991
With all the single women you know.

11:37.991 --> 11:41.271
Seth, there's a clogged toilet in the
men's room that's got your nameon it.

11:41.271 --> 11:41.671
Sweet.

11:41.911 --> 11:42.311
Hey.

11:42.351 --> 11:43.151
Hi.

11:49.151 --> 11:49.551
No.

11:49.591 --> 11:50.351
Yes.

11:50.391 --> 11:50.911
No.

11:50.951 --> 11:51.311
Yes.

11:51.351 --> 11:53.031
No way. There's no way she'd even
go out with me, anyway.

11:53.031 --> 11:53.551
Are you kidding me?

11:53.551 --> 11:55.351
Her with the tattoo,
you with the wristband.

11:55.391 --> 11:57.431
That's like the ultimate
wrong-side-of-the-tracks love story.

11:57.751 --> 12:00.591
Seriously, you are the Sid
to her Nancy, the Kurt to her Courtney.

12:00.631 --> 12:03.071
The 50 Cent to her... Mrs. Cent.

12:03.111 --> 12:04.351
No. I'm done dating.
I told you that.

12:04.351 --> 12:05.751
Ryan, kids our age
don't even date anymore.

12:05.791 --> 12:07.711
They hang out in groups,
then they peel off to hook up.

12:07.751 --> 12:08.711
You've never done that.

12:08.751 --> 12:11.111
No, I know, but I read about it
in New York Times Magazine.

12:11.791 --> 12:14.111
My guess is that
Alex loves the group hang.

12:14.311 --> 12:15.591
Group hang?

12:15.871 --> 12:17.471
That's the lamest thing I've ever heard.

12:17.511 --> 12:19.351
But later, we peel off, and...

12:19.391 --> 12:21.271
And do what, go to Chuck E Cheese,
mini-golf?

12:21.311 --> 12:23.351
I swear, mentally,
you are seven years old.

12:23.351 --> 12:25.591
That was last year.
This year, I'm eight and three-quarters.

12:25.631 --> 12:26.831
Anyways, it's my night off.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.871
Why would I want
to spend it here with you?

12:28.911 --> 12:29.511
I'll tell you exactly why.

12:29.591 --> 12:30.111
Look at me.

12:30.231 --> 12:31.791
I'm a youth in need, okay?

12:31.791 --> 12:34.351
Somebody stomped on my sand castle,

12:34.351 --> 12:36.751
and my ball rolled out into
the middle of the street,

12:36.751 --> 12:38.631
and my kite is caught in a tree,
and I can't...

12:38.711 --> 12:39.991
- I get it.
- And you know what else?

12:39.991 --> 12:41.751
My friend Ryan--
he's really cool, okay?

12:41.791 --> 12:42.751
He's very anti-establishment.

12:42.791 --> 12:46.271
He enjoys, uh, sunset walks on the beach,
punching people, and not smiling.

12:46.311 --> 12:48.431
And that's how you see me?

12:48.431 --> 12:49.631
Yeah, only with less smiling.

12:49.631 --> 12:50.751
You're out of your mind.

12:50.791 --> 12:52.271
Maybe I am, Alex.

12:52.311 --> 12:56.591
Maybe I'm, like,
so far out of my mind that I'm in yours.

12:56.591 --> 12:58.151
And I think I know what
you're thinking right now.

12:58.191 --> 13:00.151
You're thinking, "I can't wait to go."

13:00.191 --> 13:01.751
That's what you're thinking maybe, is it?

13:01.751 --> 13:03.151
Huh? Is that what you're thinking?

13:03.191 --> 13:04.871
Okay, okay, I'll go just to
get you out...

13:04.871 --> 13:06.071
Stop freaking out.
It's okay.

13:06.111 --> 13:06.751
..... of my office.

13:06.751 --> 13:07.871
I will hook you up. It's fine.

13:07.911 --> 13:09.951
Look it, you're smiling.
I like... Gonna be really fun.

13:09.951 --> 13:10.871
- Get out, get out.
- Okay. All right.

13:10.951 --> 13:13.471
Wait. Tomorrow night at 8:00.

13:14.151 --> 13:16.151
It's gonna be awesome!

13:17.111 --> 13:19.351
So, while I can appreciate
your apprehension,

13:19.391 --> 13:23.511
let me assure you that the dip in company
earnings is only a temporary one.

13:23.551 --> 13:24.551
Good morning.

13:24.591 --> 13:25.831
So sorry I'm late.

13:25.871 --> 13:27.671
I'm glad you didn't wait for me.

13:27.711 --> 13:30.311
Julie Cooper Nichol,
CEO of the Newport Group.

13:30.311 --> 13:31.191
Hello.

13:31.191 --> 13:32.911
Julie, I was just going over

13:32.951 --> 13:36.751
our investment pitch for
Mr. Herbert's new mall development.

13:35.911 --> 13:38.791
Uh, feel free to jump in
if you think I've missed anything.

13:38.831 --> 13:40.431
Don't be so modest, Kirsten.

13:40.431 --> 13:41.711
I'll jump in now.

13:41.751 --> 13:43.671
Are there any questions I could answer?

13:43.711 --> 13:45.111
Julie,  this isn't the Q & A portion...

13:45.111 --> 13:47.671
Well, I do have a couple of questions,
Mrs. Cooper Nichol.

13:48.151 --> 13:52.151
Our primary concern is how will
Caleb Nichol's potential indictment

13:52.151 --> 13:54.031
affect the roll-out of our development?

13:54.071 --> 13:57.231
It won't, because we won't let it,
will we, Mr. Herbert?

13:57.391 --> 14:01.471
What I think Julie meant,Mr. Herbert,
is that the success of the Newport Group

14:01.471 --> 14:04.911
is not contingent on the ideas
and opinions of any one person.

14:04.911 --> 14:07.271
I think Mr. Herbert and
I can take it from here, Kiki.

14:07.751 --> 14:11.191
Will you get me a copy of this document?
I need it on my desk tout de suite.

14:11.271 --> 14:12.751
Julie...

14:12.991 --> 14:14.671
that's the lunch menu.

14:16.071 --> 14:18.071
Choo, choo-choo.

14:20.111 --> 14:23.031
Thank you all for your time.
Excuse me.

14:30.751 --> 14:32.151
So, what's your next question?

14:32.191 --> 14:34.431
How do you explain the company's failure

14:34.431 --> 14:38.871
to hedge its portfolio against the rise
of long-term interest rates?

14:41.231 --> 14:43.231
Yes...

14:44.871 --> 14:46.111
So, Alex said yes
to the date, huh?

14:46.231 --> 14:47.431
But it's not a date, okay?

14:47.551 --> 14:49.751
It's a group hang with an eye
towards peeling off with...

14:49.751 --> 14:50.751
- Summer...

14:50.951 --> 14:52.551
- I don't know if I'd be cool
with that quite yet.

14:52.631 --> 14:54.191
- On your left.

14:54.231 --> 14:57.631
- Don't mention the date.
- Right, no. Sure, take the high road.

14:58.071 --> 14:58.951
- Cohen
- Summer

15:01.151 --> 15:03.071
I have a date.

15:03.951 --> 15:06.111
Wow! Hey, hope you and
Captain Oats have fun.

15:06.551 --> 15:08.231
Actually, it's with a girl.

15:08.431 --> 15:10.071
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

15:10.111 --> 15:12.151
Coop, you just missed a milestone here.

15:12.231 --> 15:15.351
Cohen has a date with
a real live human girl.

15:16.071 --> 15:19.911
Oh. Well, uh, that's...
great, I guess. When?

15:19.991 --> 15:21.311
Ah, tonight. So, you know, don't wait up.

15:21.431 --> 15:24.231
Ah, don't worry. Zack and I'll
sleep just fine, thanks.

15:24.671 --> 15:28.991
So I'll sleep just fine tonight, too,
with...

15:30.271 --> 15:31.711
I would've loved to remember
her name right there.

15:31.831 --> 15:36.431
- High road, huh?
- Not my proudest moment.

15:37.231 --> 15:41.551
So, if Seth is abandoning you for his big
date tonight, then what are you gonna do?

15:41.671 --> 15:43.111
'Cause if you wanted to do something...

15:43.311 --> 15:48.271
- Yeah, well, I, um...
- You have a date tonight, too?

15:48.711 --> 15:51.591
No, it's not a date, it's more
of a group hang.

15:52.991 --> 15:54.511
How are things with you and DJ?

15:54.551 --> 15:58.471
They're... not... Um, but
I should probably get to,

15:58.551 --> 16:03.111
you know... But have fun tonight
on your date... or hang.

16:12.111 --> 16:14.671
- Hey.
- Hey. What are you doing here?

16:15.191 --> 16:18.151
Well, guess who brought you
a lobster roll from the Crab Shack.

16:18.471 --> 16:20.991
My hero.

16:22.031 --> 16:26.071
-My favorite sandwich, surprise pop-in ?
-Yes, it's work.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.631
Don't tell me. You screwed up.
Power went straight to your head.

16:29.711 --> 16:33.591
- You rocked the boat too hard.
- You can stop.

16:34.431 --> 16:39.991
I have found it challenging.
Truth is, being CEO is a bitch.

16:40.191 --> 16:41.991
You'd think
you'd be a natural.

16:42.231 --> 16:45.831
I tried to Google myself today and
crashed the entire computer network.

16:46.031 --> 16:49.591
Then our most important investor ran out on
his meeting with me, and I don't blame him.

16:49.631 --> 16:54.511
I never heard you admit to having
faults before. This is... this is fun!

16:54.591 --> 16:57.951
I was hoping you'd give me a confidence
boost. I suppose I don't have that coming?

16:58.031 --> 16:59.351
Sure, you do. Listen ...

16:59.951 --> 17:03.711
you may not have Kirsten's experience--
well, let's face it, any experience--

17:03.831 --> 17:04.751
Get to the boost.

17:04.790 --> 17:08.671
But you are savvy, okay, and
that goes a long way in this business.

17:08.671 --> 17:12.431
Hell, if I had your instincts,
I-I never would have lost a dime.

17:12.471 --> 17:13.830
So you think this is fixable?

17:13.830 --> 17:17.671
If there's one thing that you're good at,
it's getting money from rich, old men.

17:17.790 --> 17:20.590
You just... you gotta do it the
Julie Cooper way.

17:22.031 --> 17:25.511
You know I don't mean
sleep with him, right?

17:26.431 --> 17:32.791
You know what? I think you've just given
me the confidence to execute Plan B.

17:33.031 --> 17:37.231
And you have given me a delightful snack.
I love this new era.

17:37.311 --> 17:39.591
We should have gotten
divorced years ago.

17:40.431 --> 17:41.631
Thank you, Jimmy.

17:55.511 --> 17:58.151
Oh, hey, there she is.

17:59.631 --> 18:03.711
Hey, why don't you go talk to her for,
like, an hour or five and just tee me up.

18:03.711 --> 18:08.231
- She's your date.
- Yeah. Details. I'm gonna go find Alex.

18:17.711 --> 18:21.151
What are you doing here?
Chaperoning?

18:21.351 --> 18:25.631
- I, uh, have a date, too.
- So, we're what, doubling?

18:25.751 --> 18:27.871
Is this one of those
group hangs I read about?

18:27.911 --> 18:30.871
I'm... not sure what this is.

18:33.871 --> 18:36.471
Look, right there. That's a
very good-looking human being.

18:36.471 --> 18:38.391
- He is cute.
- I told you.

18:38.591 --> 18:40.911
But here's the thing, though.
Is he cuter than me?

18:40.911 --> 18:43.271
'Cause, I mean, should I not have
him sit at the same table as my date?

18:43.351 --> 18:45.111
Uh, you're cute, too.

18:45.391 --> 18:49.071
Really? But cuter than Ryan? I mean,
I just don't want him overwhelming me.

18:49.071 --> 18:51.111
Mm, I don't think that's possible.

18:53.351 --> 18:56.351
- Oh. You think I'm cute.
- When you're not talking.

18:56.911 --> 19:03.831
- Hey. Uh, Ryan, Alex. Alex, Ryan.
- Uh, Lindsay, Seth. Seth, Lindsay.

19:03.871 --> 19:05.831
How could I forget?

19:12.871 --> 19:17.591
Well, this should be great,
really great and not at all awkward.

19:22.831 --> 19:25.791
Yes, Your Honor. Yes!

19:25.911 --> 19:27.751
Sandy, what are you doing?

19:27.911 --> 19:30.231
I've got Judge Hatchett on the TiVo.
Have you ever seen her?

19:30.231 --> 19:32.711
She does not take crap from anybody.

19:32.831 --> 19:36.151
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

19:36.271 --> 19:40.111
Well, you're in your pajamas, you have
orange Cheeto dust all over you...

19:40.591 --> 19:43.231
What has happened to my husband?

19:45.191 --> 19:47.631
Your father's case is as good as lost.

19:47.791 --> 19:49.911
He's been giving me
the complete run-around.

19:49.911 --> 19:53.471
Today he sent me to go meet with
his former assistant, Phyllis.

19:53.991 --> 19:58.311
- Phyllis died last year.
- Exactly. Literally dead ends.

19:58.311 --> 20:00.111
That's the best lead he's given me yet.

20:00.791 --> 20:04.311
Julie seems to be on the same
seek-and-destroy mission as my dad.

20:04.791 --> 20:08.191
As long as she's running the company,
I might as well...

20:08.271 --> 20:12.671
Give up. Why don't we give up?
Oh, give up with me, honey.

20:12.671 --> 20:15.511
You know, we could let the gruesome
twosome destroy our careers,

20:15.671 --> 20:16.831
or we could sit here

20:16.831 --> 20:20.391
and enjoy obscene amounts
of Dr. Phil and destroy them ourselves.

20:20.551 --> 20:22.031
Sandy?

20:22.551 --> 20:25.911
If my dad is acting all weird,
he's hiding something.

20:27.231 --> 20:28.591
I know.

20:28.871 --> 20:33.191
Which means it's your job
to figure out what that is.

20:43.551 --> 20:45.031
Now, I know I'm not
your favorite person right now,

20:45.031 --> 20:46.391
but I have a way to make it up to you.

20:46.431 --> 20:48.791
- This can't be good.
- Let's have a party.

20:48.911 --> 20:51.271
Uh, sure. Julie, can we talk
about this tomorrow?

20:51.271 --> 20:54.711
Sure, we can. Unfortunately,
the caterers are here right now.

20:54.711 --> 20:57.791
- Come on in, guys. This way.
- What's going on?

20:57.791 --> 20:59.031
Well, you know, here's the thing.

20:59.031 --> 21:01.911
I knew that if I asked you in advance
that you'd probably say no,

21:01.951 --> 21:04.911
so I went ahead and called Mr. Herbert
and several other clients

21:04.911 --> 21:06.351
and invited them to a party.

21:06.391 --> 21:07.911
- At our house?
- Tonight?

21:08.071 --> 21:11.031
Uh-huh. Yeah, Caleb thought
it was a great idea.

21:11.231 --> 21:14.151
He went to the club
to meet someone from work.

21:16.351 --> 21:17.271
Meet who?

21:17.351 --> 21:21.311
Who knows?
Well, so much to do, so little time.

21:29.951 --> 21:36.951
<i>Save some face.
You know you've only got one</i>

21:37.271 --> 21:42.271
<i>Change your ways
While you're young</i>

21:44.631 --> 21:54.231
<i>Boy, one day you'll be a man
Oh, Girl</i>

21:54.471 --> 22:02.471
<i>He'll help you understand
Smile like you mean it</i>

22:06.831 --> 22:12.311
<i>Looking back
At sunsets on the...</i>

22:12.751 --> 22:15.911
So, the Killers.
Awesome, huh?

22:16.431 --> 22:21.471
Stellar observation, and one you've
made, like, eight times now.

22:25.231 --> 22:26.751
So, do you like live music?

22:26.751 --> 22:29.271
Not really. You?

22:30.631 --> 22:32.431
It's my passion.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.111
Dude, I'm dying here.

22:39.111 --> 22:41.991
Yeah. Well, my guess is, this secret
conference isn't exactly helping.

22:42.151 --> 22:44.031
Well, the good news is,
we already hit rock bottom,

22:44.031 --> 22:46.951
although I've redefined rock bottom
several times tonight.

22:46.991 --> 22:49.791
I think we just hit a new low.

23:31.008 --> 23:33.848
Coop, there was no way
I was gonna let you stay home tonight.

23:33.848 --> 23:36.608
Yeah, I know-- I just wish I didn't have
to third-wheel on your date.

23:36.648 --> 23:38.608
What? Ducky and I don't mind.
Do we, Ducky?

23:38.608 --> 23:40.928
Yeah, how much longer is this
Ducky thing gonna go on for?

23:41.088 --> 23:45.888
Aw, do you want a new nickname?
How about... Cohen?

23:45.888 --> 23:48.528
I think it's a little too soon
to joke about that, don't you think?

23:48.768 --> 23:53.688
- Summer! Oh, my God, hey! How are you?
- Hey, Cohen.

23:54.208 --> 23:55.928
- Ryan
- Marissa

23:56.128 --> 24:00.728
Uh, this is Lindsay.
This is Alex.

24:03.288 --> 24:05.088
- This is Lindsay.
- Hi. Yeah, okay.

24:05.208 --> 24:08.088
- Well, this, um, this is ju...
- This is awesome.

24:08.088 --> 24:10.208
It's awesome!

24:13.528 --> 24:15.968
- You know what, maybe we should...
- Go watch the band.

24:19.248 --> 24:23.128
So, I'm guessing we just
met some ex-girlfriends?

24:23.528 --> 24:25.608
Well, Ryan and Marissa,
that's an epic tale right there.

24:25.608 --> 24:28.368
But Summer and I are
equally as fascinating.

24:28.368 --> 24:30.808
She was my shorty last year,
but then she got served.

24:31.848 --> 24:35.128
Not that that's...
particularly interesting.

24:39.848 --> 24:41.768
Jimmy, thank God you're here.

24:41.968 --> 24:45.128
Julie invited me.
She knows I can't turn down free booze.

24:45.248 --> 24:46.728
Neither can she.

24:47.608 --> 24:50.968
Look at her.
All that giggling and touching.

24:51.568 --> 24:53.648
Oh, God, she just grazed an ass.

24:53.888 --> 24:58.208
Oh, the not so subtle ass graze.
Yeah, I've been a victim of it myself.

24:58.608 --> 25:02.248
Don't worry about it. She's schmoozing
the crowd at a cocktail party.

25:02.248 --> 25:03.968
This is our star clientele.

25:04.168 --> 25:06.608
Do you know how many years
of wooing and cajoling it took

25:06.608 --> 25:08.048
to have a meeting with these people?

25:08.088 --> 25:11.608
This is the woman who came
from Riverside to become head Newksie,

25:11.608 --> 25:15.448
then landed Newport's biggest tycoon
and took over his company.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.288
She knows what she's doing.

25:25.928 --> 25:28.288
....she's following me around,
judging, judging, judging.

25:28.608 --> 25:31.688
Ten bucks says Cohen is bending
that poor girl's ear about

25:31.688 --> 25:36.208
Superman or Batman or something-man in a
unitard that she doesn't give a crap about.

25:36.288 --> 25:41.848
You know what?
I should stop him. For her sake.

25:42.248 --> 25:44.728
Well, that sounds like it's coming from
a really generous place.

25:44.928 --> 25:48.008
Or we could just put the Cohen obsession
on hold and watch the band.

25:48.008 --> 25:49.608
I am not obsessing.

25:49.728 --> 25:53.808
The seething, the staring, the analyzing
of his outfit, that's not obsessing?

25:53.808 --> 25:57.488
What? That shirt totally
accentuates his bird arms.

25:57.928 --> 26:01.408
I think this is the part
where I go to the bathroom.

26:19.248 --> 26:22.688
But I will admit that our breakup, to the
outside observer, could seem sad,

26:22.688 --> 26:26.128
but I don't know, for me, I feel like
it's given me this great gift,

26:26.128 --> 26:27.088
you know, this new era.

26:27.168 --> 26:32.088
And this whole new situation, like,
her, Zack, you and I, it works!

27:17.728 --> 27:19.648
Oh, drinking alone--
that's never a good sign.

27:19.848 --> 27:21.088
What the hell are you doing here?

27:21.128 --> 27:25.448
Well, I tried to talk to Phyllis earlier,
but I left my Ouija board at home.

27:26.168 --> 27:31.488
No more games, Cal. Who was
that woman I saw leave this place?

27:32.008 --> 27:35.488
- You trailed me here? Spied on me?
- No, actually I got lucky.

27:35.488 --> 27:37.128
I showed up just as she was leaving.

27:37.328 --> 27:41.568
Well, she was, uh, she's a...
an old friend.

27:41.568 --> 27:46.368
Come on. You built a fortune on lies;
you can do better than that.

27:46.568 --> 27:51.008
- My guess-- that was Renee Wheeler.
- I told you, I don't know her.

27:51.088 --> 27:52.768
All right, well, then that was somebody
driving Renee Wheeler's car.

27:52.768 --> 27:55.848
I called her license plate number into
a friend of mine at the police station.

27:56.728 --> 28:00.928
Well-played, Magnum P.I.
Stay away from her.

28:01.928 --> 28:05.088
I'll only ask you this once, Cal.

28:06.808 --> 28:08.328
Are you having an affair?

28:09.048 --> 28:11.688
We're in much deeper water
than that, believe me.

28:11.968 --> 28:14.928
- If I were you,I'd leave it alone.
- What if I don't?

28:15.168 --> 28:17.288
Well, we could lose everything.

28:17.728 --> 28:21.248
So before you go probing around
into my affairs,

28:21.608 --> 28:27.248
think long and hard--
is it worth it to you?

28:36.288 --> 28:38.088
All right, let's hear it
for the Killers!

28:40.968 --> 28:42.888
You know what it is?
So, it's like four-two.

28:42.888 --> 28:46.528
Her over there, me over here,
me over her over here,

28:46.528 --> 28:49.848
so the four of us hanging out, over
each other, but hanging out together.

28:49.928 --> 28:52.808
I mean, apart, but in the same place,
although different places mentally, I think.

28:52.888 --> 28:54.448
Cohen, there is
something wrong with you.

28:54.568 --> 28:58.008
No. That's the best part. I am
totally fine not talking to her.

28:58.048 --> 29:01.568
I have nothing to say to her. Except,
the only thing that I would say

29:01.568 --> 29:04.528
if I said something to her-- and I don't
care at all if I do-- is that I'm fine

29:04.528 --> 29:06.288
not talking to her.

29:06.888 --> 29:08.168
Maybe I should tell her that.

29:08.528 --> 29:11.928
Well, you better hurry, 'cause
they're leaving.

29:12.688 --> 29:14.848
I'll be right back.

29:22.408 --> 29:23.648
Hey, you came.

29:23.968 --> 29:26.848
Well, my friend got tickets
and had an extra.

29:34.408 --> 29:36.568
I'll see you around.

29:38.368 --> 29:41.648
- Maybe you should tell her.
- Tell who what?

29:41.728 --> 29:44.408
Lindsay... that you like her.

29:46.448 --> 29:49.928
I'm not offended. It's okay.
It's a group hang, and, um, ...

29:49.928 --> 29:54.168
listen, no offense here, but I'm not
really feeling the spark.

29:54.328 --> 29:59.608
Wow. An honest conversation with a girl.
This is new for me.

30:01.648 --> 30:03.368
I'm gone. Thanks.

30:05.248 --> 30:07.688
I was not talking about Cohen
the entire night.

30:07.688 --> 30:09.408
It sure felt like it.

30:09.568 --> 30:10.808
Well... What, you want
to go somewhere else?

30:10.808 --> 30:14.248
Maybe you should go home and log onto
some kind of Cohen chat room, okay?

30:14.248 --> 30:15.208
I've had enough.

30:15.248 --> 30:18.328
- Summer, hey. Where are you going?
- Oh, look. It's Seth.

30:18.448 --> 30:19.088
We're going home.

30:19.088 --> 30:21.288
Okay, can I talk to you for, like,
one minute? Zack, I'm really sorry.

30:21.328 --> 30:24.248
- Okay. I'm gonna go jump off the pier.
- Zack, wait!

30:24.248 --> 30:26.088
Listen, I just want to tell you
I don't want to talk,

30:26.088 --> 30:27.328
okay? I'm fine with this.

30:27.448 --> 30:30.008
You and him, me and her.
Zack sure is a fast walker.

30:30.128 --> 30:31.808
Look, Cohen, just stop trailing us,
all right?

30:31.808 --> 30:33.768
- I'm not...
- Zack, will you wait, please?

30:34.288 --> 30:36.528
- I just, I...
- Just beat it.

30:36.808 --> 30:38.488
Ducky!

30:38.688 --> 30:42.928
Please. Please...

30:49.008 --> 30:53.128
- If you promise to stop calling me that.
- Can't make any promises.

30:59.208 --> 31:00.888
Where are you going?
Can I give you a lift or something?

31:00.888 --> 31:02.888
I couldn't possibly ask any more from you,

31:02.888 --> 31:05.928
nor can I thank you enough for what was
truly one of the worst evenings of my life.

31:06.048 --> 31:08.328
I know. Seth's not ready to date yet.
It was, it was a bad idea.

31:08.328 --> 31:11.688
Yeah, it was a colossally
bad idea, epically bad.

31:11.968 --> 31:14.408
The invasion of Iraq is looking
pretty good in comparison.

31:14.408 --> 31:16.328
Okay. All right, you're right.
Let me talk to you for a second.

31:16.368 --> 31:20.528
No. Ryan, you can't. I've listened to
enough talk for one night, okay?

31:21.648 --> 31:24.208
See you at school.

31:31.648 --> 31:33.608
Oh, Kiki, come here.
You'll never believe this.

31:33.608 --> 31:37.688
Steven's daughter has a pony, too.
She boards at the same stable as China.

31:37.688 --> 31:39.168
What a coincidence.

31:39.328 --> 31:41.648
How cute is that
little riding park? Oh.

31:41.648 --> 31:43.888
And at Christmas, when they string
all the lights through the trees...

31:43.928 --> 31:49.128
Yes. My daughter and her Shetland
spend all their Saturdays there.

31:49.808 --> 31:53.088
Uh, Steven... about the meeting;
I-I wanted to apologize.

31:53.088 --> 31:56.568
You know, Kirsten is the one who
renovated the stable and the park,

31:56.608 --> 31:59.968
then sold it back to the original owners
at twice the cost.

32:00.448 --> 32:03.608
"Preservation and profit,"
that's your motto, right, Kirsten?

32:04.288 --> 32:06.488
Well, that's
every developer's dream.

32:07.568 --> 32:10.288
Funny, mine's Jude Law
and a zebra-skin rug.

32:12.528 --> 32:15.008
Uh, Steven, your drink's looking
a little empty. Can I get you another?

32:15.008 --> 32:16.288
Only if you two join me.

32:16.288 --> 32:20.288
Ooh. Be careful, Steven. Kirsten here's
got a bit of a hollow leg.

32:20.768 --> 32:22.168
What are you drinking?

32:22.168 --> 32:23.648
- Uh, champagne.
- Make it two.

32:24.768 --> 32:26.448
- Done.
- Thank you.

32:28.168 --> 32:30.248
See, I'm not totally useless.

32:30.248 --> 32:32.688
- I never said...
- Apology accepted.

32:33.488 --> 32:35.688
I'm gonna go get Mr. Herbert's
contract out of my purse.

32:35.688 --> 32:39.608
You make sure he gets
another whiskey sour.

32:46.848 --> 32:48.848
- How was your night?
- Not good. You?

32:49.568 --> 32:51.048
Worse.

32:51.568 --> 32:54.048
- You didn't like Alex?
- Eh. And you and Lindsay?

32:54.048 --> 32:56.728
Uh, not even close.

32:58.648 --> 33:04.208
- What are you gonna do now?
- Actually... I was gonna go and...

33:04.208 --> 33:05.648
Oh, go for it.

33:05.768 --> 33:06.968
- Yeah?
- Yes.

33:07.408 --> 33:08.568
What are you gonna do?

33:08.888 --> 33:11.768
- I don't know. I was gonna maybe...
- Good idea.

33:15.248 --> 33:18.568
Great show. I hope you
guys come back soon.

33:24.648 --> 33:30.488
So, to recap, I got discoed
by two girls in one night,

33:30.808 --> 33:34.128
and, unfortunately, that's just not
the first time that's happened.

33:34.208 --> 33:36.728
Actually, I'm not surprised.

33:36.728 --> 33:39.128
Thank you. Keep twisting the
knife. I'm not in enough pain.

33:39.288 --> 33:42.208
Oh, you're the one who's
hurting, not Summer or Lindsay?

33:42.608 --> 33:45.928
Yeah, well, at least everybody's
miserable, right?

33:46.128 --> 33:53.488
Anyways, uh, I'm sorry about the whole
group hang or whatever that was.

33:53.488 --> 33:54.768
Night.

34:04.608 --> 34:06.728
Hard to believe all those girls
running out on you...

34:06.728 --> 34:08.368
Don't make me try and feel better.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.128
....what with you being
so bratty and immature.

34:11.128 --> 34:12.648
Oh, good, you weren't.

34:12.688 --> 34:16.728
And even sometimes...

34:17.208 --> 34:23.248
a little... charming, especially when
you're not talking about Summer.

34:23.648 --> 34:24.848
I know. I just...

34:24.967 --> 34:29.728
And knowing is half the battles so perhaps
there's a little hope for you yet.

34:34.447 --> 34:36.128
You want to go maybe get
an ice cream, or something?

34:36.168 --> 34:38.608
Ice cream as a nightcap?

34:38.848 --> 34:42.368
- You really are eight.
- And three-quarters.

34:52.368 --> 34:53.967
Let's go.

34:54.088 --> 34:57.528
I'll buy, but, um, no
more than two scoops.

34:57.688 --> 35:06.688
<i>Swim against the tide,
yet you drowned... ...in the sky</i>

35:08.288 --> 35:17.568
<i>You whisper to make a sound
And you crawl to reach the ground</i>

35:18.888 --> 35:27.728
<i>You held your head up high
Yet you duck beneath the cloud</i>

35:29.368 --> 35:46.288
<i>And you are on your way
You are on your way</i>

35:52.088 --> 35:54.608
- Keeping watch?
- What are you doing here?

35:54.888 --> 35:58.448
I was headed to your house,
and I thought I'd surprise you.

35:58.688 --> 36:00.928
So this means...?

36:05.448 --> 36:08.648
I'm not sure exactly, except,

36:08.848 --> 36:11.048
I guess I'd better prepare
myself for some drama, huh?

36:11.488 --> 36:14.928
You have no idea.

36:31.608 --> 36:40.728
- Hi. Need a lift?
- No, thanks. The bus'll be here soon.

36:50.728 --> 36:54.328
Okay, did you not understand the
part about me taking the bus?

36:54.328 --> 36:55.488
All right. Hold on.

36:55.568 --> 37:00.568
Uh, don't. It's my fault. I knew it was
gonna be a disaster with Seth.

37:00.568 --> 37:01.688
Then why'd you say yes?

37:01.768 --> 37:04.608
Because I thought
you were asking me out.

37:06.208 --> 37:08.288
Didn't mean to say that out loud.

37:08.288 --> 37:10.288
Uh, what?

37:10.448 --> 37:18.848
I thought that I was saying yes to you.

37:18.848 --> 37:20.208
Where's that stupid bus?

37:20.208 --> 37:25.368
You did? 'Cause I... I mean,
you think I'm an idiot.

37:25.928 --> 37:32.008
Yeah, well, I guess that's the twist,
'cause turns out I'm the idiot.

37:33.048 --> 37:35.008
No, no, you're not.

37:38.848 --> 37:42.288
When I asked you out that day
for Seth, I, uh... Well, I, uh...

37:45.128 --> 37:46.648
Keep talking, Ryan.

37:48.568 --> 37:50.688
I wanted it to be me. I did.

37:50.688 --> 37:54.008
I just didn't think in a million years
you'd say yes.

37:59.288 --> 38:04.208
Then I've been right all along.
You are an idiot.

38:06.888 --> 38:12.048
- An idiot you'd go out with sometime?
- It's possible.

38:19.648 --> 38:21.728
Ah, party's over.

38:21.728 --> 38:26.568
Oh, finally. I literally had to push
Steven Herbert out the door.

38:26.928 --> 38:28.448
Deal's back on?

38:28.728 --> 38:32.368
He resigned his contracts. Hopefully
he'll remember that in the morning.

38:32.648 --> 38:37.328
Julie Cooper-- definitely understands
the weakness of man.

38:37.328 --> 38:38.888
You were gone for a while.

38:39.008 --> 38:41.248
Well, I was driving around,

38:41.928 --> 38:47.008
thinking how I find myself again
in a very familiar triangle.

38:47.208 --> 38:48.368
What triangle is that?

38:48.368 --> 38:54.168
- You, me, your dad.
- He's guilty, isn't he?

38:54.168 --> 38:56.088
He's guilty of something.

38:56.688 --> 38:59.128
Something he thinks
we're better off not knowing.

38:59.248 --> 39:01.408
Well, you've never been one
to shy away from the truth.

39:01.488 --> 39:03.288
I can start now.

39:03.288 --> 39:07.928
Well, a man could make a nice life
out of Cheetos and Dr. Phil.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.048
Not the man I love.

39:23.368 --> 39:37.168
<i>Tough you think you've got the stuff
You're telling me and anyone</i>

39:37.368 --> 39:45.608
<i>You're hard enough
You don't have to put up a fight</i>

39:46.928 --> 39:51.248
<i>You don't have to always be right</i>

39:52.768 --> 40:00.448
<i>Let me take some
of the punches for you tonight</i>

40:03.848 --> 40:12.488
<i>Listen to me now
I need to let you know</i>

40:13.288 --> 40:24.048
<i>You don't have to go it alone
And it's you when I look in a mirror</i>

40:24.728 --> 40:29.088
<i>And it's you makes me have to let go</i>

40:30.008 --> 40:43.448
<i>Sometimes you can't make it on your own
Sometimes you can't make it</i>

40:43.848 --> 40:48.848
<i>Best you can do is to fake it</i>

40:49.208 --> 40:58.968
<i>Sometimes you can't make it
on your own.</i>
