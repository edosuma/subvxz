STRAIGHT INTO THAT SHIT.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.779
{\an8}I'M LIKE, ALL RIGHT,

07:27.029 --> 07:29.448

FOR A MINUTE.

07:47.466 --> 07:48.593
{\an8}- OKAY.
- COOL.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.138
{\an8}- WEIRD.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.139
{\an8}- DO YOU WANNA SIT DOWN?

07:53.222 --> 07:54.807
{\an8}- I DECIDED TO LET MIKE IN

07:55.099 --> 07:56.100
{\an8}JUST BECAUSE I DEFINITELY
HAD BEEN WAITING

07:56.434 --> 07:57.810
{\an8}FOR MIKE TO TALK TO ME.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.896

{\an8}- IT DEFINITELY UPSETS ME
THAT WE DON'T SIT AND TALK

08:02.940 --> 08:04.650
{\an8}OR HAVE A FRIENDSHIP AT ALL.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.987

YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

08:14.368 --> 08:15.953
{\an8}I'M A DIFFERENT PERSON,

08:16.037 --> 08:17.496
{\an8}AND I DEFINITELY WANTED
TO COME AND LOOK YOU IN THE EYE

08:17.830 --> 08:20.541
{\an8}AND TELL YOU THAT I'M SORRY,
YOU KNOW?

08:20.625 --> 08:22.418
{\an8}- IT'S REALLY HARD
TO FORGET EVERYTHING

08:22.501 --> 08:25.671
{\an8}THAT HAPPENED LAST SUMMER.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.006
{\an8}WHY THE FUCK
WOULD YOU TELL UNIT

08:27.340 --> 08:28.925
{\an8}TO FUCKIN' CALL JIONNI?

08:29.175 --> 08:31.177
{\an8}FUCK YOU.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.763
{\an8}[objects crashing]
I'M NOT KIDDING.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.057
{\an8}YOU KNOW, YOU COMPLETELY
WERE TALKING SHIT

08:36.349 --> 08:38.893
{\an8}BEHIND MY BACK
AND, YOU KNOW,

08:38.976 --> 08:42.772
{\an8}IT BASICALLY JUST EMBARRASSED
ME AND JIONNI AS A COUPLE.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.857
{\an8}- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO YOU,
SNOOKS.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.150
{\an8}- REALLY? YOU JUST TOLD
MY BOYFRIEND WE HOOKED UP

08:46.234 --> 08:47.526
{\an8}A MONTH BEFORE ITALY.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.488
{\an8}- I TOLD YOU NOT
TO SAY ANYTHING.

08:50.571 --> 08:54.367
{\an8}- I'M OBVIOUSLY HURT BECAUSE
YOU DID THAT TO ME AS A FRIEND.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.701
{\an8}BUT I'M ALSO HURT
BECAUSE...

08:56.035 --> 08:57.787
{\an8}YOU TOTALLY MADE A FOOL
OUT OF HIM.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.623
{\an8}I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU WOULD DO THAT TO ME.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.585
{\an8}- [sighs]

09:04.669 --> 09:06.212
{\an8}MAYBE I WAS PROTECTIVE.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.880
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
ALMOST LIKE A SISTER.

09:08.297 --> 09:09.548
{\an8}YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE NOT HAPPY
WITH SOMEBODY, WHO THEY'RE WITH,

09:09.632 --> 09:11.550
{\an8}YOU'RE JUST LIKE--
YOU KNOW, I APOLOGIZE.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.844
{\an8}- IT'S JUST AWKWARD...

09:14.095 --> 09:15.596
{\an8}IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.931
{\an8}JUST EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.432
{\an8}YOU SCARED OF MILK, POPEYE?

09:18.516 --> 09:20.142
{\an8}- ONCE A CHEATER,
ONCE A CHEATER.

09:20.434 --> 09:22.228
{\an8}- I NEVER CHEATED ON HIM,
YOU FUCKING MORON!

09:22.311 --> 09:23.729
{\an8}- YOU KNOW,
WE WERE REALLY TIGHT.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.233
{\an8}YOU WERE THE ONLY GIRL
THAT I'VE EVER, EVER HAD

09:27.525 --> 09:29.193
{\an8}AS A FRIEND,
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH.

09:29.277 --> 09:32.863
{\an8}AND YOU WERE THE BEST FRIEND
I'VE HAD TO BE HONEST.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.740
{\an8}- MIKE!
- OH!

09:34.824 --> 09:36.242
{\an8}AND THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE
OUT THERE IN THE WORLD

09:36.534 --> 09:37.702
{\an8}THAT'S GONNA
LIKE YOU FOR YOU.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.287
{\an8}THIS IS GETTING WILD
RIGHT NOW.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.496
{\an8}RIGHT?
IT'S GETTING WILD?

09:40.579 --> 09:42.290
{\an8}- YOU FUCKIN' ASSHOLE!

09:42.373 --> 09:44.333
{\an8}- IN MY OPINION,
YOU WERE JUST WILD LIKE ME.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.669
{\an8}- YEAH, WE'RE THE SAME PERSON
AND WE GOT EACH OTHER.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.255
{\an8}AND THAT'S WHY
WE WERE SO CLOSE.

09:49.505 --> 09:50.798
{\an8}BUT YOU JUST DON'T DO THAT
TO SOMEONE

09:50.881 --> 09:51.841
{\an8}WHO YOU'RE REALLY GOOD
FRIENDS WITH.

09:57.638 --> 09:58.764
{\an8}- [laughing]

09:58.848 --> 10:00.099
{\an8}I'M WILLING TO, YOU KNOW,

10:00.433 --> 10:03.352
{\an8}FIX WHATEVER NEEDS
TO BE FIXED, YOU KNOW?

10:03.436 --> 10:05.730
{\an8}'CAUSE YOU DEFINITELY ARE
AN IMPORTANT PERSON IN MY LIFE,

10:05.813 --> 10:07.565
{\an8}AND I WOULD HATE TO LOSE YOU.

10:07.648 --> 10:08.983
{\an8}THAT WOULD SUCK.

10:09.066 --> 10:11.777
{\an8}- YOU KINDA DID.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.988
{\an8}- I KNOW I DID.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.115
{\an8}I FUCKED UP, YOU KNOW?

10:16.365 --> 10:17.533
{\an8}- YEAH.

10:17.616 --> 10:19.160
{\an8}I'M REALLY SHOCKED
AT HOW GENUINE

10:19.493 --> 10:20.369
{\an8}LIKE MIKE'S
FEELINGS ARE RIGHT NOW,

10:20.453 --> 10:21.871
{\an8}BUT THERE'S SO MUCH DAMAGE.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.498
{\an8}IT'S HARD TO FORGET
WHAT YOU DID TO ME.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.083
{\an8}BUT I WAS REALLY WAITING
FOR YOU

10:26.375 --> 10:28.336
{\an8}TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION
WITH ME FOR A WHILE.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.714
{\an8}- YEAH...
- BUT WHATEVER.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.799
{\an8}I'M OVER IT.
LIKE, YOU KNOW,

10:34.133 --> 10:35.676
{\an8}I HAVE SO MUCH OTHER THINGS
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.219
{\an8}I'M HAVING A BABY
IN TWO MONTHS.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.722
{\an8}- I KNOW. I THINK--
I THINK YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.515
{\an8}- THANK YOU.
- YOU DO.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.560
{\an8}YOU DO KINDA
ACCEPT MY APOLOGY?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.270
{\an8}KIND OF?

10:58.115 --> 10:59.742
{\an8}- I'M GONNA TRY...

10:59.825 --> 11:00.993
{\an8}BUT LIKE I SAID,
IT'S REALLY HARD.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.912
{\an8}- I UNDERSTAND.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.581
{\an8}I APPRECIATE YOU JUST SITTING
DOWN WITH ME, YOU KNOW?

11:05.664 --> 11:06.957
{\an8}THIS IS COOL FOR ME,
YOU KNOW.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.834
{\an8}I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.545
{\an8}I HOPE TO BE THERE FOR YOU
IF YOU EVER NEED ME.

11:11.629 --> 11:12.963
{\an8}IS THAT COOL?

11:13.047 --> 11:14.340

A HALF-HUG OR SOMETHING

11:16.258 --> 11:18.010
{\an8}OR A KISS ON THE CHEEK

{\an8}- START WITH A HIGH FIVE...

11:19.887 --> 11:22.431
{\an8}YOU AWKWARD MAN, YOU.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.766

{\an8}IF YOU HAVEN'T EVEN HAD
A CONVERSATION

11:25.518 --> 11:26.769

13:13.375 --> 13:15.002
{\an8}- THEY'RE GONNA COME

13:15.085 --> 13:16.504
{\an8}- IF THEY COME AND HIT ME
WITH A WATER BALLOON,

13:16.587 --> 13:18.547
{\an8}I SWEAR TO GOD I'M PUNCHING
ONE OF THEM IN THE FACE.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.132
{\an8}I WILL HIT A BITCH.
I'M FROM STATEN ISLAND.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.384
{\an8}[laughter]

13:22.468 --> 13:24.803
{\an8}THIS PRANK IS NOT AMUSING.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.806

13:27.890 --> 13:30.142
{\an8}I THINK WE CAN JUMP THIS.

13:30.226 --> 13:31.894
{\an8}- I COULD JUMP THIS SHIT.

13:31.977 --> 13:35.064
{\an8}I'M NOT AFRAID TO JUMP BECAUSE
I CONSTANTLY LAND ON MY FEETS.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.316
{\an8}- SON, THAT'S AN EASY JUMP.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.318
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.
SOMETHING DROPPED DOWN.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.986
{\an8}- HELL, YEAH, I'M JUMPING
STRAIGHT INTO THAT SHIP.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.738
{\an8}- I'LL GO UNLOCK IT.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.323
{\an8}- NO, I DON'T WANNA DO IT
ANYMORE.

13:44.615 --> 13:45.282
{\an8}- OH, ALL RIGHT.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.159
{\an8}- MIKE'S ABOUT TO JUMP.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.495
{\an8}I'M LIKE ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS NOT FUNNY ANYMORE.

13:49.787 --> 13:50.871
{\an8}[laughter]

13:50.955 --> 13:53.624
{\an8}all: OH!

13:53.707 --> 13:55.834
{\an8}SAM, IT'S TOO LATE!
- OH, MY GOD!

13:56.168 --> 13:57.878
{\an8}- THE GIRLS ARE LIKE,
"OH, MY GOD,

13:57.962 --> 13:59.296
{\an8}THEY'RE JUMPING
OVER THE BALCONY."

13:59.630 --> 14:01.173
{\an8}AND I'M LIKE,
"OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU SERIOUS?"

14:01.257 --> 14:03.050
{\an8}I'M LIKE, "UNLOCK THE DOOR.
ABORT--ABORT THIS PRANK.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.510
{\an8}ABORT THIS PRANK."

14:04.593 --> 14:06.178
{\an8}- IT'S OPEN!
SAM, TELL THEM IT'S OPEN!

14:06.262 --> 14:07.638
{\an8}- TELL 'EM IT'S OPEN.
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.515
{\an8}WATCH 'EM JUMP THOUGH.
- BE LIKE, "IT'S UNLOCKED."

14:09.807 --> 14:12.268
{\an8}YO, IT'S UNLOCKED.
IT'S UNLOCKED.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.519
{\an8}IT'S UNLOCKED.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.563
{\an8}- WE WERE GONNA JUMP.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.815
{\an8}- THEY WERE REALLY
GONNA JUMP.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.650
{\an8}- SO SHE UNLOCKS THE DOOR,
WE COME IN.

14:19.733 --> 14:22.027
{\an8}I MEAN, HAVEN'T THEY LEARNED
AFTER SIX HOUSES

14:22.278 --> 14:23.487
{\an8}THAT WE DO
THE DOPEST PRANKS?

14:23.779 --> 14:26.282
{\an8}DO NOT MESS WITH
THE PRANK WAR CHAMPIONS.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.117
{\an8}- SO HOW DO YOU LOCK THE DOOR
AND REMEMBER IT WAS LOCKED?

14:28.367 --> 14:29.660
{\an8}- HMM?

14:29.743 --> 14:32.413
{\an8}- HAD TO BE A REASON
THAT YOU LOCKED THE DOOR.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.582
{\an8}OH, YOU JUST REMEMBERED
OUT OF NOWHERE,

14:34.665 --> 14:36.417
{\an8}HOLY SHIT,
I LEFT THE DOOR LOCKED?

14:36.709 --> 14:39.336
{\an8}SO YOU WENT UP
AND UNLOCKED IT.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.796
{\an8}YOU'RE ALL FUCKED.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.214
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE I'M GETTING
IN TROUBLE RIGHT NOW.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.674
{\an8}- WHY DO YOU EVEN BOTHER?

14:43.757 --> 14:46.093
{\an8}YOU'RE ONLY GONNA GET IT
SIX TIMES AS WORSE.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.219
{\an8}- RON'S ALL TALK.

{\an8}ALL RIGHT?

29:58.588 --> 30:01.132
{\an8}- YOU WANNA GRAB FOOD?
- GRAB FOOD.

30:01.216 --> 30:02.383
{\an8}WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT CALLING JIONNI

30:02.675 --> 30:04.260
{\an8}AND HAVING HIM COME?

30:04.677 --> 30:06.679
{\an8}- WELL, LISTEN, I DON'T REALLY
WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH JIONNI,

30:06.763 --> 30:08.306
{\an8}I'LL TELL YOU THAT
STRAIGHT UP.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.476
{\an8}BUT JIONNI DID JUST IMPREGNATE
A MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY,

30:11.768 --> 30:14.437
{\an8}SO WE HAVE TO INITIATE JIONNI
INTO OUR FAMILY,

30:14.521 --> 30:16.147
{\an8}GET TO KNOW THIS KID,

30:16.523 --> 30:19.108
{\an8}AND SEE WHAT HIS REAL INTENTIONS
ARE WITH OUR SISTER SNOOKI.

{\an8}I MEAN, I'M COOL
WITH HIM NOW, SO...

30:20.652 --> 30:22.111
{\an8}- YEAH.
- I'M DOWN.

30:22.487 --> 30:23.821
{\an8}- I'LL CALL HIM UP AND SEE
IF HE WANTS TO MEET US UP.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.448
{\an8}HE'S ONE OF THE GUYS NOW
IF HE MARRIES SNOOKI.

30:25.698 --> 30:27.367
{\an8}- NO WAY, BRO. [laughs]
- CRAZY.

30:27.659 --> 30:28.743
{\an8}- CAN'T COME INTO MY FAMILY.

30:28.826 --> 30:30.328
{\an8}NOW, THAT'S ALWAYS CUSTOMARY.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.580
{\an8}WHENEVER LIKE, UH, IN MY FAMILY
WHEN SOMEBODY GETS--

30:32.664 --> 30:34.791

{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, COOL.
DO THAT, THEN.

30:39.128 --> 30:40.004
{\an8}- YEAH, CALL HIM
AND SEE IF HE CAN COME.

30:40.088 --> 30:41.339
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.

30:41.631 --> 30:43.007
{\an8}I WANT TO ASK JIONNI
A BUNCH OF THINGS,

30:43.091 --> 30:44.759
{\an8}LIKE WHAT
HIS INTENTIONS ARE,

30:44.842 --> 30:47.595
{\an8}IS HE EXCITED ABOUT THE BABY,
IS HE EXCITED ABOUT THE WEDDING?

30:47.679 --> 30:50.014
{\an8}WHAT HE DOES FOR A LIVING, DOES
HE HAVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

30:50.098 --> 30:51.474
{\an8}WHERE DOES HE LIVE,

30:51.558 --> 30:53.560
{\an8}WHERE DOES HE PLAN TO LIVE
ONCE HE GETS MARRIED?

30:53.643 --> 30:55.353
{\an8}SO, WE HAVE A LOT
TO TALK ABOUT.

30:55.603 --> 30:57.522
{\an8}[phone line rings]
- HELLO?

31:04.028 --> 31:05.363
{\an8}UM, I WAS GONNA SEE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING TONIGHT

31:05.697 --> 31:06.864
{\an8}BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA
GO OUT WITH THE BOYS,

31:06.948 --> 31:08.157
{\an8}WANTED TO SEE
IF YOU WANTED TO COME

31:08.408 --> 31:09.826
{\an8}AT LIKE 10--AT LIKE 10:15.
- UM...

31:09.909 --> 31:11.119
{\an8}YEAH, I COULD
PROBABLY MEET YOU.

31:11.369 --> 31:13.329
{\an8}- YEAH, YOU WANNA DO THAT?
- YEAH.

31:13.413 --> 31:15.623
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, COOL.
- NO PROBLEM. SOUNDS GOOD.

31:15.707 --> 31:16.916
{\an8}- WE NEVER, EVER
TAKE JIONNI OUT,

31:17.250 --> 31:18.793
{\an8}AND NOW WE HAVE JIONNI
ALL TO OURSELF.

31:18.876 --> 31:20.628
{\an8}HE DOESN'T KNOW
IF WE'RE PRANKING HIM,

31:20.712 --> 31:22.171
{\an8}WE'RE SETTING HIM UP
TO FAIL,

31:22.255 --> 31:23.381
{\an8}OR WE'RE GONNA TORTURE HIM,

31:23.673 --> 31:24.257
{\an8}HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HE'S IN FOR.

31:24.591 --> 31:25.925
{\an8}ALL RIGHT, PERFECT.

31:26.009 --> 31:27.135
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, PAL,
I'LL SEE YOU LATER. THANKS.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.262
{\an8}- LATER.
- ALL RIGHT, BYE.

31:29.637 --> 31:31.264
{\an8}- MIKE, LAST YEAR I WAS
A GOOD GUY TO YOU, YOU KNOW?

31:31.347 --> 31:32.140
{\an8}- YOU WERE.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.891
{\an8}- SHIT TALKING, I JUST--

31:33.975 --> 31:35.476
{\an8}- I WASN'T REALLY SHIT TALKING,
I WAS BEING HONEST.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.812
{\an8}JIONNI, YOU ARE NOT
GETTING TO ME RIGHT NOW.

31:37.895 --> 31:40.023
{\an8}- I JUST FELT LIKE
IT WAS AN UNMANLY THING.

31:48.698 --> 31:50.033
{\an8}- WHAT'S THE PLAN
FOR TONIGHT?

31:50.116 --> 31:51.576
{\an8}- GUYS ARE GOING TO DINNER
AND THE CIGAR BAR.

31:51.659 --> 31:53.077
{\an8}- SO, THE GIRLS
ARE STAYING HOME?

31:53.369 --> 31:54.495
{\an8}- AND THEY'RE
GONNA GET FACIALS

31:54.787 --> 31:56.080
{\an8}AND THEN WE'RE
GONNA GET FACIALS.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.415
{\an8}- WHY ARE YOU BRINGING
JUST JIONNI OUT?

31:57.707 --> 31:58.791
{\an8}- WHAT?

31:58.875 --> 32:00.126
{\an8}- ARE YOU GONNA
BE NICE TO HIM?

32:00.460 --> 32:01.169
{\an8}- YEAH, WE'RE JUST
HAVING A GUYS' NIGHT.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.962
{\an8}- YEAH, BUT WHY?

32:03.046 --> 32:04.756
{\an8}- HE'S GONNA BE OUR NEW BROTHER,
AND YOU'RE OUR SISTER, SO...

32:04.839 --> 32:06.257
{\an8}- SO YOU'RE GONNA BE NICE,
RIGHT?

32:06.549 --> 32:07.634
{\an8}- YEAH, I PROMISE.
- I TRUST YOU.

32:07.717 --> 32:09.719
{\an8}- WE'LL BE NICE.
- OKAY.

32:09.802 --> 32:12.889
{\an8}- IF YOU TELL ME TO BE NICE,
WE'LL BE NICE.

32:12.972 --> 32:14.307
{\an8}- I FEEL BAD FOR JIONNI,
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

32:14.390 --> 32:16.184
{\an8}WHAT THE BOYS WANT WITH HIM.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.353
{\an8}- GUYS!
WE GOTTA GO!

32:18.436 --> 32:21.022
{\an8}- THEY CAN DEFINITELY BUST BALLS
AND MAKE FUN OF PEOPLE,

32:21.105 --> 32:23.274
{\an8}AND I JUST DON'T WANT THEM
DOING THAT TO JIONNI,

32:23.358 --> 32:24.609
{\an8}BECAUSE HE IS
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,

32:24.901 --> 32:26.152
{\an8}AND LET'S NOT
TRY AND CHASE HIM AWAY.

32:26.235 --> 32:28.696
{\an8}- ROLL OUT!
BYE, GIRLS. HAVE FUN.

32:28.780 --> 32:29.947

{\an8}GOOD LUCK, JIONNI.
[laughs]

32:36.537 --> 32:37.747
{\an8}- SO, IF YOUR PASTA
TAKES REALLY LONG,

32:37.830 --> 32:39.540
{\an8}START THE PASTA FIRST.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.335
{\an8}- I'M KIND OF JUST GOING ALONG
WITH WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

32:42.752 --> 32:45.088

- [strains]

32:52.679 --> 32:54.347
{\an8}- IT FEELS REALLY NICE
NOT HAVING THE BOYS AROUND.

32:54.639 --> 32:55.932

US GIRLS ARE FINE.

IS KNOCKING ON THE DOOR?

33:04.524 --> 33:05.400

A GIRLS' NIGHT.

33:18.913 --> 33:20.707
{\an8}- YOU GUYS DIDN'T
TELL ME ABOUT THIS?

33:20.790 --> 33:23.334
{\an8}- [laughs]
- ARE YOU GUYS FUCKED UP?

33:23.418 --> 33:25.044
{\an8}- [laughs]
- WE THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE IT.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.046

{\an8}AND I ABSOLUTELY HATE
THAT STUFF.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.099
{\an8}DOES ANYBODY ELSE
GET FREAKED OUT BY THIS?

33:38.182 --> 33:39.392
{\an8}- A LITTLE BIT.

33:39.475 --> 33:40.727
{\an8}- ARE YOU FREAKED OUT?

33:40.810 --> 33:42.478
{\an8}- I JUST GET NERVOUS
WITH STUFF LIKE THIS.

33:42.812 --> 33:44.939
{\an8}I THOUGHT WE WERE
HAVING A FACE MASK NIGHT.

33:45.022 --> 33:46.315
{\an8}WITH ONESIES.

33:46.607 --> 33:48.109
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT,
LET ME JUST WALK AROUND

33:48.192 --> 33:49.610
{\an8}AND--AND DO MY THING.

{\an8}I'M JUST GONNA FEEL LIKE
THE ENERGY IN THE WHOLE HOUSE,

33:51.821 --> 33:52.780

WHAT I FIND.

{\an8}SO, WHEN I GET CHILLS,

34:39.744 --> 34:41.120
{\an8}THAT'S LIKE
A SPIRIT PRESENT OR SOMETHING.

34:41.454 --> 34:43.371

IN THAT BED NOW.

{\an8}REALLY? HE HANGS OUT
RIGHT NEAR MY BED?

34:47.960 --> 34:49.462
{\an8}DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHY
I HAVE SUCH BAD DREAMS?

34:49.545 --> 34:50.755
{\an8}- DO YOU HAVE BAD DREAMS?

34:50.838 --> 34:52.422
{\an8}- HORRIBLE DREAMS.
- COULD BE.

THERE'S A PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE.

{\an8}- WE DIDN'T--WE DIDN'T
NEED SOMEBODY TO COME HERE

35:00.014 --> 35:01.599

THAT THERE'S PEOPLE IN HERE.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.351

36:18.259 --> 36:19.594
{\an8}I-I WOULDN'T--
I WOULDN'T BE HERE, YOU KNOW?

36:19.886 --> 36:21.554
{\an8}I'M NOT--
I'M NOT LIKE A JERKOFF.

36:21.637 --> 36:23.222
{\an8}I HAVE A CLOSE FAMILY.
MY BROTHER LIVES BEHIND ME.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.516
{\an8}SISTER'S A MILE AWAY, AND MY
OTHER BROTHER'S A MILE AWAY.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.018
{\an8}EVERY SUNDAY DINNER,
THEY'RE ALWAYS AT MY HOUSE.

36:27.101 --> 36:28.352
{\an8}- YEAH.
- NO MATTER WHAT.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.186
{\an8}IT'S NOT--
- NO, THAT'S GOOD.

36:29.270 --> 36:30.354
{\an8}- [laughs]

36:30.646 --> 36:32.106
{\an8}- JIONNI SOUNDS
A LOT LIKE ME.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.567
{\an8}HE HAS SISTERS, HE HAS SUNDAY
DINNER EVERY SUNDAY,

36:34.650 --> 36:36.819
{\an8}HE HAS A BIG FAMILY,
WHICH IS A GOOD THING.

36:37.111 --> 36:38.529
{\an8}YEAH, LIKE WHERE DO YOU
SEE YOURSELF LIKE

36:38.821 --> 36:40.531
{\an8}DOING FOR WORK,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

36:40.615 --> 36:42.617
{\an8}- WELL, I MEAN, MY ATM BUSINESS
IS JUST, YOU KNOW, EXPANDING.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.035
{\an8}LIKE YOU KNOW, I'M GETTING
OPPORTUNITIES ALL THE TIME.

36:44.118 --> 36:46.245
{\an8}- WHAT IS THAT?
YOU OWN ATMs?

36:46.329 --> 36:47.747
{\an8}- YEAH.

36:48.039 --> 36:48.623
{\an8}YOU KNOW, IF YOU GO TO A CLUB
AND YOU SWIPE IT?

36:48.873 --> 36:50.082
{\an8}- MM-HMM.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.417
{\an8}- I'LL MAKE THE PERCENT
THAT'S--THAT'S--

36:51.751 --> 36:52.877
{\an8}- YOU GOT A F--
THE FEE THAT THEY CHARGE.

36:53.127 --> 36:54.170
{\an8}- HOWEVER YOU GOTTA
MAKE MONEY

36:54.503 --> 36:56.047
{\an8}TO SUPPORT NICOLE AND THE BABY,
YOU DO IT.

36:56.130 --> 36:57.423
{\an8}IF IT'S AN ATM BUSINESS,

36:57.757 --> 36:59.467
{\an8}IF IT'S HANDJOBS
FOR CRACK ON THE CORNER,

36:59.717 --> 37:00.968
{\an8}WHATEVER YOU GOTTA DO,

37:01.052 --> 37:02.929
{\an8}JUST MAKE THAT MONEY
AND TAKE CARE OF NICOLE.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.597
{\an8}- LAST YEAR EVERYBODY
SAID TO ME, YOU KNOW,

37:04.972 --> 37:06.724
{\an8}LIKE, "ALL THE GUYS
ARE TALKING SHIT ABOUT YOU.

37:06.807 --> 37:08.643
{\an8}THEY SAID, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
USING HER, YOU'RE DOING THIS."

37:09.060 --> 37:10.311
{\an8}THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO CLEAR UP.
THAT'S NOT--THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

37:10.603 --> 37:11.687
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IF I WAS--

37:11.979 --> 37:13.439
{\an8}IF THAT WAS
EVER THE CASE, I--

37:13.522 --> 37:14.732
{\an8}WHY WOULD I CARE SO--
ABOUT THE WHOLE ITALY THING?

37:15.024 --> 37:17.485
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT KILLED ME.

37:17.860 --> 37:20.237
{\an8}YOU KNOW, THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME
SHE SCREWED UP WITH ME,

37:20.321 --> 37:21.948
{\an8}AND I GAVE HER
A SECOND CHANCE.

37:22.031 --> 37:24.700
{\an8}- IT'S VERY AWKWARD WHEN JIONNI
STARTS TO TALK ABOUT ITALY,

37:24.992 --> 37:26.327
{\an8}BECAUSE THAT'S JUST
A CONVERSATION

37:26.410 --> 37:27.745
{\an8}YOU NEVER WANT TO HAVE

37:28.079 --> 37:31.916
{\an8}WITH THE BABY DADDY
OF A GIRL WHO YOU BANGED.

37:32.208 --> 37:33.960
{\an8}- MIKE, THE ONLY THING
IS I WAS--

37:34.043 --> 37:35.336
{\an8}LAST YEAR I WAS
A GOOD GUY TO YOU, YOU KNOW.

37:35.419 --> 37:36.462
{\an8}- YOU WERE.

37:36.712 --> 37:38.214
{\an8}- THE SHIT TALKING,
I JUST--

37:38.297 --> 37:41.717
{\an8}- I WASN'T REALLY SHIT TALKING.
I WAS BEING HONEST.

37:45.221 --> 37:45.846
{\an8}- THERE'S MORE <i> JERSEY SHORE</i>
ON THE WAY,

37:46.180 --> 37:47.431
{\an8}AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.775
{\an8}- MIKE, THE ONLY THING
IS I WAS--

37:57.858 --> 37:59.193
{\an8}LAST YEAR I WAS
A GOOD GUY TO YOU, YOU KNOW.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.277
{\an8}- YOU WERE.

38:00.569 --> 38:02.029
{\an8}- THE SHIT TALKING,
I JUST--

38:02.113 --> 38:04.281
{\an8}- I WASN'T REALLY SHIT TALKING.
I WAS BEING HONEST.

38:04.365 --> 38:06.075
{\an8}- I JUST FELT LIKE IT WAS
AN UNMANLY THING,

38:06.158 --> 38:07.618
{\an8}BUT AS LONG AS SHE'S HAPPY
THAT'S ALL I CARED ABOUT.

38:07.868 --> 38:08.619
{\an8}SHE TOLD ME YESTERDAY.

38:08.869 --> 38:09.954
{\an8}- I APOLOGIZE TOO.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.914
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS

38:12.206 --> 38:13.874
{\an8}I DEFINITELY
WAS A DIFFERENT PERSON.

38:14.166 --> 38:15.209
{\an8}I'M SURE THESE GUYS
WILL TELL YOU,

38:15.292 --> 38:16.794
{\an8}AND YOU KNOW,
I'M BACK TO BEING

38:17.169 --> 38:19.380
{\an8}THE PERSON WHO, YOU KNOW,
I STRIVE TO BE ON A DAILY BASIS.

38:19.463 --> 38:21.590
{\an8}JIONNI, YOU ARE NOT
GETTING TO ME RIGHT NOW.

38:21.882 --> 38:23.884
{\an8}I'VE ALREADY APOLOGIZED
TO YOUR GIRL.

38:24.176 --> 38:25.678
{\an8}- BUT IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH
WITH US TOO.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.638
{\an8}- YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH
WITH US, BUT...

38:28.014 --> 38:30.558
{\an8}- I PUT THAT INTO--TO--
TO PLAY, YOU KNOW. TRUST ME.

38:30.641 --> 38:31.934
{\an8}- NO,
SHE'S DEFINITELY HAPPY.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.519
{\an8}YOU MAKE HER HAPPY,
SO THAT MAKES US HAPPY.

38:33.602 --> 38:34.812
{\an8}- NO, I KNOW, AND--AND--

38:35.104 --> 38:36.689
{\an8}- 'CAUSE SHE HASN'T
BEEN HAPPY LATELY

38:36.772 --> 38:38.107
{\an8}BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND,
SO SHE'S BEEN LIKE VERY...

38:38.190 --> 38:39.483
{\an8}- I HAVEN'T BEEN DOWN HERE?
- KEEP TO HERSELF.

38:39.567 --> 38:40.776
{\an8}YEAH, SHE'S VERY
LIKE TO HERSELF.

38:41.068 --> 38:42.570
{\an8}- WHY DOES EVERYONE
KEEP SAYING THAT?

38:42.653 --> 38:43.863
{\an8}I'M DOWN EVERY WEEK--
I'M HERE EVERY THURSDAY, FRIDAY.

38:44.155 --> 38:44.655
{\an8}- SHE MAKES IT SEEM LIKE
YOU'RE NOT HERE.

38:44.947 --> 38:46.490
{\an8}- WHO, SHE DOES?

38:46.574 --> 38:47.825
{\an8}- YEAH, EVERYBODY MAKES IT
SEEM LIKE YOU'RE NOT AROUND.

38:48.117 --> 38:49.660
{\an8}- YEAH.
- JENNI WAS LIKE SAYING THAT.

38:49.744 --> 38:50.578
{\an8}AND LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHY
IT BECAME A BIG CONVERSATION.

38:50.661 --> 38:51.954
{\an8}- WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

38:52.038 --> 38:53.748
{\an8}- SHE'S THE ONE
THAT PUT IT IN EVERYBODY'S HEAD.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.291
{\an8}UM, JIONNI'S GETTING
REAL DEFENSIVE WHEN WE SAY

38:55.374 --> 38:56.834
{\an8}THAT JENNI SAID THAT JIONNI'S
NOT AROUND TOO MUCH.

38:57.209 --> 38:58.669
{\an8}- I MEAN, I-I THOUGHT
WE WERE DOING GOOD DOWN HERE.

38:58.961 --> 38:59.795
{\an8}I WAS COMING, YOU KNOW,
TWICE A WEEK.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.505
{\an8}- BRO, HONESTLY,

39:01.589 --> 39:03.758
{\an8}IT MADE IT SEEM LIKE YOU GUYS
WEREN'T TOGETHER AND STUFF.

39:03.841 --> 39:04.633
{\an8}- NO, THAT WOULD NEVER--THAT
WOULD NEVER HAPPEN, YOU KNOW.

39:04.717 --> 39:05.760
{\an8}- OKAY.

39:06.052 --> 39:07.178
{\an8}- I'M
AN HOUR AND A HALF AWAY,

39:07.261 --> 39:08.763
{\an8}AND I TRY TO RUN
MY BUSINESS, YOU KNOW.

39:09.138 --> 39:10.431
{\an8}SO IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO COME HERE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.

39:10.514 --> 39:12.516
{\an8}MY MACHINES I HAVE TO
MAINTAIN, YOU KNOW.

39:12.600 --> 39:13.851
{\an8}- JIONNI'S
TELLING US RIGHT NOW

39:14.143 --> 39:15.436
{\an8}THAT HE LIVES
AN HOUR AND A HALF AWAY

39:15.519 --> 39:18.105
{\an8}AND THAT IT'S EXTREMELY HARD
TO VISIT SNOOKI.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.648
{\an8}AND I'M LIKE, "DUDE,
IT AIN'T THAT BAD OF A TRIP."

39:19.899 --> 39:21.025
{\an8}- AT THE END OF THE DAY,

39:21.108 --> 39:22.526
{\an8}WE DON'T WANT HER
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.

39:22.818 --> 39:24.111
{\an8}- THAT'S WHAT I MEAN,
AND I KNOW THAT,

39:24.195 --> 39:25.154
{\an8}AND THAT'S WHY
I'M MARRYING THE GIRL, YOU KNOW?

39:25.237 --> 39:26.947
{\an8}- NO, SHE HAS A GOOD HEART.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.491
{\an8}- SHE--SHE REALLY--
SHE DOES.

39:28.574 --> 39:30.659
{\an8}- JENNI, ON THE OTHER HAND--NO.
[laughter]

39:30.910 --> 39:31.827
{\an8}- SWITCH!
- I'M SORRY.

39:32.078 --> 39:33.496
{\an8}- SWITCH!
- [laughs]

39:33.579 --> 39:35.039
{\an8}- YEAH, THAT'S GONNA BE
A DOPE WEDDING, THOUGH.

39:35.122 --> 39:36.457
{\an8}- AS LONG AS YOU GUYS'LL COME
TO THE BACHELOR PARTY.

39:36.540 --> 39:37.833
{\an8}all: OH!

39:38.125 --> 39:39.043
{\an8}- WE'LL THROW
YOUR BACHELOR PARTY.

39:39.293 --> 39:40.628
{\an8}- PARTY WITH US.
- VEGAS.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.296
{\an8}- PAULY'S DJ-ING.

39:42.379 --> 39:44.840
{\an8}- I'M INVITED TO JIONNI'S
BACHELOR PARTY. [clicks tongue]

39:44.924 --> 39:46.717
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A GOOD
IDEA, BUT IT'S GOING DOWN.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.303
{\an8}- I BIT DOWN AND TOOK
A LOT OF SHIT, YOU KNOW?

39:49.386 --> 39:51.639
{\an8}AND...
YOU KNOW...

39:51.722 --> 39:52.932
{\an8}I LEARNED
FROM A LOT OF SHIT,

39:53.265 --> 39:54.308
{\an8}AND WE'RE STRONGER
THAN EVER RIGHT NOW.

39:54.391 --> 39:56.143
{\an8}- GOOD.
- WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.020
{\an8}- WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.
SALUD.

39:58.312 --> 40:00.022
{\an8}- SALUD. THANKS, GUYS.
I APPRECIATE IT.

40:00.356 --> 40:02.650
{\an8}- SO WE DAP UP WITH JIONNI,
AND THAT SHOWS HIM RESPECT.

40:02.900 --> 40:03.984
{\an8}HE SHOWS US RESPECT.

40:04.276 --> 40:04.985
{\an8}THAT MEANS HE HAS
SOME BROTHERS

40:05.319 --> 40:06.654
{\an8}THAT ARE LIFELONG FRIENDS.

40:06.737 --> 40:07.947
{\an8}YOU CAN'T BUY THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

40:08.197 --> 40:09.532
{\an8}WELCOME TO THE FAMILY,
MY DUDE.

40:09.615 --> 40:11.492
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, YO,

{\an8}- YO, WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU

40:16.872 --> 40:18.207
{\an8}- I CAN USE ONE.

40:18.290 --> 40:19.625
{\an8}- THANKS, BUDDY.
APPRECIATE EVERYTHING.

40:19.708 --> 40:20.751

40:32.138 --> 40:33.472
{\an8}- [cheers]

40:33.722 --> 40:36.225

40:46.193 --> 40:47.945
{\an8}- MIKE ACTUALLY

40:48.279 --> 40:48.988
{\an8}I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.824
{\an8}- [screams]
