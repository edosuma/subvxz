00:54.340 --> 00:57.700
Dolphins are very sensitive.
So take good care of her, okay?

01:04.780 --> 01:07.020
I never thought I could get a
dolphin to do a double flip,

01:07.100 --> 01:08.620
but Heidi finally did it.

01:08.700 --> 01:11.940
Heidi thinks you're great.
She would do anything for you.

01:12.020 --> 01:13.420
Did she tell you that?

01:14.220 --> 01:16.340
Dolphins can tell
when you've got a good heart.

01:16.420 --> 01:18.620
It's one of the things
I like about you.

01:20.660 --> 01:23.460
So... what do you have planned
for your day off?

01:23.540 --> 01:24.940
Not much.

01:25.020 --> 01:28.500
-Well, how about we go to the beach?
-Just us?

01:28.580 --> 01:30.660
Yeah. Just us.

01:30.740 --> 01:32.380
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.820
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

01:47.460 --> 01:48.780
Finders, keepers.

01:48.860 --> 01:50.220
No.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.740
This is the biggest
tip I've ever had.

01:54.700 --> 01:56.740
That's the guy
who's opening the new hotel.

01:56.820 --> 01:58.180
Supposed to be a
very cool design.

01:59.060 --> 02:01.060
The kind of place celebrities hang out?
-Could be.

02:01.140 --> 02:04.660
I hope they come here.
And bring all their friends.

02:05.980 --> 02:07.820
Why would those kind
of people come here?

02:14.980 --> 02:16.780
Guess what?

02:16.860 --> 02:19.300
Mimmi's got a date.
-What!

02:19.380 --> 02:21.460
She's going to the beach
with Chris tomorrow.

02:21.540 --> 02:23.380
Are you out of your mind?

02:23.460 --> 02:25.180
He asked and I said yes.

02:25.260 --> 02:26.700
Do I really need to explain

02:26.780 --> 02:29.060
all the problems with a
mermaid going to the beach?

02:29.140 --> 02:31.660
She likes him. I say go for it.

02:31.740 --> 02:33.900
How do you know
you can trust him?

02:33.980 --> 02:35.740
I'm not going to tell
him I'm a mermaid.

02:35.820 --> 02:38.980
And anyway, Cam and David kept
our secret, why can't Chris?

02:39.060 --> 02:40.740
What about the
people he works with?

02:40.820 --> 02:43.100
He lets slip to
somebody what you are,

02:43.180 --> 02:45.180
you end up the Marine Park's
major exhibit,

02:45.260 --> 02:46.740
and we have to pay to visit you.

02:46.820 --> 02:49.020
You're overreacting.
Chris wouldn't tell...

02:49.100 --> 02:50.220
he's a good person.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.180
You don't know what
he's really like.

02:52.260 --> 02:53.980
You never do,
until it's too late.

02:57.220 --> 03:00.020
Look... find a way
to get out of this, Mimmi.

03:00.980 --> 03:02.020
It's for the best.

03:02.100 --> 03:03.460
Believe me.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.460
No more beach wear?

03:08.540 --> 03:11.340
We're going upmarket to attract
a more sophisticated clientele.

03:11.420 --> 03:12.900
Like that hotel guy?
-Exactly.

03:12.980 --> 03:17.060
And sophisticated people want an upmarket
dining experience, so that means tapas.

03:17.140 --> 03:19.580
Tapas?
-It's Spanish for finger food.

03:19.660 --> 03:21.300
It's all the rage.

03:21.380 --> 03:23.940
You really should consult me
about changes like this.

03:24.020 --> 03:26.260
That's what I'm doing now.
We can't waste any time.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.340
We need to change our image,
carve out a niche in the market

03:28.420 --> 03:29.700
before someone else
beats us to it.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.220
It's a big risk.

03:32.300 --> 03:34.260
They're the only
kind worth taking.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.500
Yes?
-Hi.

03:40.580 --> 03:42.780
Is Mimmi here?
-No.

03:42.860 --> 03:44.340
I'll let her know you called.

03:44.420 --> 03:46.260
Ooh! Chris!

03:46.340 --> 03:48.420
Hi. Mimmi's coming.

03:49.780 --> 03:50.900
Hi.
-Hey.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.460
Let's go.
-Okay.

03:52.540 --> 03:54.580
Have fun!
-Bye.

04:03.380 --> 04:05.180
So, uh...

04:05.260 --> 04:06.700
you ready to hit the water?

04:06.780 --> 04:08.900
Ah,
I'd rather warm up a bit first.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.700
But you go. Have fun.

04:46.980 --> 04:48.460
What do you think you're doing?

04:48.540 --> 04:50.300
Looking after Mimmi.

04:53.020 --> 04:54.580
She's not a hatchling, you know.

04:54.660 --> 04:57.380
She can look after herself.
Leave her alone, okay?

04:57.460 --> 04:59.820
Hey. The water's awesome.

05:06.420 --> 05:07.700
Uh...

05:08.820 --> 05:09.820
Stop it!

05:09.900 --> 05:12.020
He's going to wet her!
-Ondina!

05:19.860 --> 05:22.020
You need to calm down.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.860
Come on,
I'll buy you an ice cream.

05:23.940 --> 05:26.020
Come on, let's go.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.460
Come on!

05:29.580 --> 05:31.860
So...
are you ready to come in now?

05:31.940 --> 05:34.180
Actually, it's pretty hot.

05:34.260 --> 05:36.060
I wouldn't mind
getting off the beach.

05:36.140 --> 05:38.020
Okay, let's go for a walk.

05:41.860 --> 05:43.860
Thank you. Sorry, no chocolate.

05:46.060 --> 05:47.140
Ondina?

05:53.300 --> 05:54.580
Oh, great.

05:57.540 --> 06:00.820
Why did it take you
so long to ask me out?

06:00.900 --> 06:02.140
Well, I was scared you'd say no.

06:03.900 --> 06:05.860
You don't have to be
scared with me.

06:10.860 --> 06:13.300
So, do you want to
get something to eat?

06:13.380 --> 06:14.420
Uh...

06:15.260 --> 06:16.900
I've got a better idea.

06:55.860 --> 06:57.300
What are you doing?

06:58.900 --> 07:00.380
Redecorating.

07:00.460 --> 07:01.900
Just for tonight...

07:01.980 --> 07:04.020
until I can find a more
permanent solution.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.500
You won't be able
to see my shop.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.620
That's the point.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.460
Racks of bikini bottoms
kind of lower the tone.

07:09.540 --> 07:12.780
Since when?
-Since Cam decided to go upmarket

07:12.860 --> 07:16.020
and ditch everything that makes
the Ocean Café the Ocean Café.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.700
But that's why people come here.

07:17.780 --> 07:18.900
You're going to put
off the old customers.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.540
And attract new,
sophisticated ones.

07:21.620 --> 07:23.340
Maybe you could redecorate.

07:23.420 --> 07:25.500
Maybe get some...
classier stock.

07:25.580 --> 07:27.220
It's a surf shop.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.740
What do you want me to sell?
Evening wear?

07:28.820 --> 07:30.220
Could you?

07:30.740 --> 07:31.940
You're crazy!

07:33.100 --> 07:34.300
What's with the black clothes?

07:34.380 --> 07:36.500
New look for the café,
new look for the staff.

07:36.580 --> 07:38.780
I'll make this work, you'll see.

07:48.900 --> 07:49.980
Thank you.

07:53.660 --> 07:55.100
So, food now?

07:55.180 --> 07:57.020
Not just yet.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.500
Let's look at the view.

08:13.340 --> 08:17.100
You know, all my life
I've been attracted to the sea.

08:18.820 --> 08:21.020
It's such an amazing world
we know so little about.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.300
Mmm-hmm,
you're right about that.

08:23.540 --> 08:25.140
I remember when I was a kid,

08:25.220 --> 08:28.740
I used to dive off my parents'
yacht and I'd swim down the bottom.

08:29.740 --> 08:31.340
And I'd just lie
there on my back,

08:31.420 --> 08:33.140
looking up at the surface,

08:33.220 --> 08:35.820
like I was a fish,
looking out at the human world.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.340
You probably think
that's pretty silly.

08:38.419 --> 08:39.460
No.

08:40.460 --> 08:42.140
I think it's sweet.

08:53.660 --> 08:54.900
Where did that come from?

08:54.980 --> 08:57.380
Oh, it's just a squall.
It'll be gone in a sec.

09:10.620 --> 09:11.740
I'm sorry.

09:13.860 --> 09:15.180
Mimmi?

09:21.220 --> 09:22.700
Mimmi!

09:36.100 --> 09:37.380
Mimmi?

10:09.620 --> 10:11.940
The storm came out of nowhere.

10:12.020 --> 10:14.900
There wasn't time to say
anything to Chris.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.340
I just had to run.

10:16.420 --> 10:18.220
An instant storm.

10:18.300 --> 10:19.980
How weird.

10:20.060 --> 10:21.540
Isn't that weird, Ondina?

10:21.620 --> 10:23.380
Something was bound to go wrong.

10:25.060 --> 10:26.860
I did warn you.
- I know.

10:27.860 --> 10:28.860
What was I thinking?

10:28.940 --> 10:31.460
You were thinking that you
like Chris and he likes you.

10:31.540 --> 10:33.180
Nothing wrong with that now.
Is there, Ondina?

10:33.260 --> 10:35.180
Except that it was
never going to work.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.500
You were right, Ondina.

10:37.580 --> 10:40.460
I was behaving like
a hatchling in love.

10:41.580 --> 10:43.460
Dating a land boy
only means trouble.

10:48.860 --> 10:50.100
Happy now?

10:50.180 --> 10:52.100
Why did you have
to ruin it for her?

10:52.180 --> 10:53.500
You heard Mimmi...

10:53.580 --> 10:56.140
A land boy means trouble.
I was protecting her.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.380
What you did at the park
was way beyond that.

10:58.460 --> 11:00.620
What I did was save
Mimmi a lot of grief.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.620
I know how these things end up.

11:04.980 --> 11:07.380
She's better off without him,
trust me.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.700
This isn't about Chris, is it?

11:30.140 --> 11:32.260
If you've come to have
a go at me, forget it.

11:32.340 --> 11:34.940
I'm doing this.
I can make it work.

11:35.020 --> 11:37.460
People are used to
how the place is, Cam.

11:37.540 --> 11:38.780
They don't want change.

11:38.860 --> 11:40.060
Look...

11:41.260 --> 11:43.700
people think I'm just Cam.

11:43.780 --> 11:45.020
The goofy guy that
likes eating burgers.

11:45.100 --> 11:50.700
But I bought into the café because...
I wanted to put my stamp on it.

11:50.780 --> 11:52.020
Make it better.

11:53.020 --> 11:55.940
And I know you and David
have your doubts, but...

11:56.020 --> 11:57.300
I can do this. I can.

11:57.380 --> 11:58.900
Just...

11:59.900 --> 12:01.580
have a little faith in me.

12:03.540 --> 12:04.660
Okay.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.700
Erik said he cared about me.

12:08.980 --> 12:11.260
That all he ever wanted
was to protect me.

12:12.900 --> 12:13.940
So I trusted him.

12:18.220 --> 12:20.380
In the end, he let me down.

12:20.460 --> 12:21.780
That must have been awful.

12:24.340 --> 12:27.620
But that was just you and
one boy. One experience.

12:28.620 --> 12:32.220
The point is, you can never be
sure how things will turn out.

12:33.140 --> 12:35.260
Even if Chris turned out
to be like Erik...

12:36.340 --> 12:37.900
Mimmi would never thank you
for interfering.

12:37.980 --> 12:39.540
I'm not interfering...

12:40.540 --> 12:41.900
I'm protecting her.

12:42.660 --> 12:44.220
You can't protect her forever.

12:48.180 --> 12:50.220
Mimmi has to make
her own mistakes.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.500
Like you did.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.300
And you have to let
her swim her own path.

13:03.420 --> 13:04.460
Hi.

13:05.940 --> 13:08.180
I wanted to return this.

13:09.980 --> 13:11.260
Is Mimmi all right?

13:11.340 --> 13:13.260
She ran off.

13:13.340 --> 13:15.380
Yeah, about that...

13:15.460 --> 13:16.500
Look...

13:16.580 --> 13:21.460
Can you just tell her that if she
doesn't want to see me, it's okay.

13:21.540 --> 13:23.860
I just thought we were
getting on really well,

13:23.940 --> 13:26.580
and I think she's
a fantastic person, but...

13:28.220 --> 13:30.420
I guess you can't make someone
like you back, can you?

13:32.100 --> 13:33.940
Anyway,
I just hope she's all right.

13:42.860 --> 13:45.460
You know what you have
to do now, don't you?

14:09.740 --> 14:11.020
Are you okay?

14:11.980 --> 14:12.980
Just...

14:13.860 --> 14:16.060
wish things could
have been different.

14:18.020 --> 14:20.740
Maybe they could have been,
if it wasn't for me.

14:22.940 --> 14:26.580
The reason it went wrong with Chris
is because I made sure it did.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.900
The storm in the park?

14:30.340 --> 14:31.500
That was me.

14:32.460 --> 14:35.020
But... why would you do that?

14:36.460 --> 14:37.780
It's Erik.

14:40.180 --> 14:44.340
He left me feeling like I'd been hit
in the stomach by a hammerhead shark.

14:44.420 --> 14:46.900
I just wanted to make sure
you didn't go through that.

14:46.980 --> 14:48.740
I can't believe
you ruined my date.

14:48.820 --> 14:51.580
I know it was wrong
and I am so sorry.

14:54.380 --> 14:55.860
But if you like Chris...

14:56.980 --> 14:58.500
you should go for it.

14:58.580 --> 15:00.660
It's too late.
-No!

15:01.500 --> 15:03.020
He really likes you.

15:06.700 --> 15:09.580
There's only one way to find out
if you can trust him...

15:09.660 --> 15:11.380
and that's to keep seeing him.

15:13.220 --> 15:15.300
Maybe one day
you can tell him your secret.

15:15.380 --> 15:19.220
And, in the meantime, I'm
pretending to be someone I'm not.

15:20.260 --> 15:21.620
That's not fair on him.

15:23.140 --> 15:24.900
You were right, Ondina.

15:24.980 --> 15:26.980
It can't ever work between us.

15:34.380 --> 15:37.820
<i>* Hold me closer</i>
<i>And I'm crazy, boy, for you *</i>

15:39.380 --> 15:43.260
<i>* So I think of all
the times we had *</i>

15:45.420 --> 15:50.220
<i>* And why don't you
know it's real *</i>

15:51.020 --> 15:56.180
<i>* Hold me close now</i>
<i>Crazy but it's true *</i>

15:57.380 --> 16:01.980
<i>* Send me spinning,
baby</i> <i>I'm with you *</i>

16:03.380 --> 16:08.060
<i>* Then each night,
I turn to you *</i>

16:09.340 --> 16:15.140
<i>* Kiss me, baby 'Cause I'm
crazy, boy, for you... *</i>

16:15.220 --> 16:16.540
Hi, Evie.

16:17.460 --> 16:19.660
The place looks amazing.
-Thanks.

16:19.740 --> 16:21.780
I told Zac I'd meet him here.
I thought I'd be late.

16:21.860 --> 16:24.460
So what time does this thing
kick off anyway?

16:26.700 --> 16:27.820
Cam?

16:39.860 --> 16:41.420
What's the point?

16:41.500 --> 16:44.300
Anyone that was going to come
is already here.

16:44.380 --> 16:45.940
No use letting the
food go to waste.

16:46.020 --> 16:47.420
It cost a fortune.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.020
This night meant so much to Cam.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.340
He only came up with
the idea yesterday.

16:53.420 --> 16:55.620
But he still put his
heart and soul into it.

16:56.620 --> 16:58.820
Where's a rent-a-crowd
when you need one, huh?

16:58.900 --> 17:01.260
Good idea.
-Hmm?

17:03.300 --> 17:05.099
I think I've scared
Mimmi off boys for life.

17:06.220 --> 17:07.980
I though that's what you wanted?

17:08.060 --> 17:10.660
Yeah, well, thanks to you, I now
realize that was a big mistake.

17:12.060 --> 17:13.140
Sorry?

17:13.220 --> 17:14.300
You made me realize

17:14.380 --> 17:16.819
I hadn't put the past behind me,
so, thank you.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.940
What?
-Thank you.

17:19.020 --> 17:21.260
I so like hearing you say that.

17:23.420 --> 17:25.660
We have to find a way to get
Mimmi and Chris back together.

17:26.660 --> 17:29.460
Have you got an Eastern spell to
undo everything I said to her?

17:29.540 --> 17:31.780
Would a fancy night at the café
do instead?

17:31.860 --> 17:32.860
Evie called.

17:32.940 --> 17:34.300
Cam's got something
special happening.

17:34.380 --> 17:35.780
How is that going to help?

17:35.860 --> 17:37.620
Well, they still like
each other, right?

17:37.700 --> 17:40.900
So we put them in the same place,
with a bit of music, dancing...

17:40.980 --> 17:42.500
no other spell required.

17:42.580 --> 17:43.580
Great.

17:44.460 --> 17:45.860
Okay,
so how do we get Chris there?

17:45.940 --> 17:47.300
He won't go if we ask him.

17:47.380 --> 17:48.580
Mmm-mmm.

17:49.940 --> 17:51.260
But...

17:51.340 --> 17:53.940
if his friend Karl went,
and Chris tagged along...

17:54.020 --> 17:55.660
How do we make sure Karl goes?

17:56.580 --> 17:58.940
There is one person I know
Karl would do anything for.

18:05.580 --> 18:06.900
I'm not in the mood.

18:06.980 --> 18:09.820
A night out is exactly what
you need. It'll cheer you up.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.380
Plus, Evie sounded desperate.

18:11.460 --> 18:12.940
Cam really needs us there.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.500
One less won't make
any difference.

18:14.580 --> 18:16.220
I don't want to go without you.

18:16.300 --> 18:18.540
I'll have to spend the night
talking to her.

18:18.620 --> 18:20.700
Yes. Please save us from that.

18:20.780 --> 18:22.500
Please come.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.820
Just think about it, okay?

18:48.220 --> 18:49.500
I just...

18:50.980 --> 18:53.060
really thought I could
do something with this place.

18:53.140 --> 18:54.660
Don't be so hard on yourself.

18:55.700 --> 18:58.020
You gave it a shot,
but the café is what it is.

18:58.100 --> 18:59.300
I know.

19:00.420 --> 19:01.740
Shorts and T-shirts.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.020
Sand on the floor.

19:05.180 --> 19:06.820
Toasties and juice.

19:06.900 --> 19:09.260
And that's why
everyone likes it.

19:11.140 --> 19:12.340
But every now and then...

19:13.980 --> 19:15.900
a bit of change is a good idea,
too.

19:21.300 --> 19:22.740
What is that?

19:24.780 --> 19:25.940
Come and see.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.700
How... how did you...

19:47.780 --> 19:50.420
Well, Evie and I called
everyone that we know,

19:50.500 --> 19:53.700
and then they called everyone
that they knew, and hey!

19:53.780 --> 19:55.060
Instant crowd.

19:57.380 --> 19:59.180
Whoa, it does look good.

20:00.180 --> 20:02.460
It's your idea, just...
tweaked a bit.

20:02.540 --> 20:05.700
Well, at least I gave you
something to work with.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.220
You know what I
like best about you?

20:10.220 --> 20:11.780
I always admit when I'm wrong?

20:11.860 --> 20:14.020
Eventually.

20:14.100 --> 20:15.580
You never stop trying.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.580
I don't think Mimmi's coming.

20:30.580 --> 20:33.340
Short of dragging her here, I don't
know what else we could have done.

20:38.060 --> 20:39.660
You look lovely.

20:39.740 --> 20:40.940
Thanks.

20:41.020 --> 20:42.300
Shall we?

20:42.380 --> 20:43.420
What?

20:43.500 --> 20:45.180
We made a deal.

20:45.260 --> 20:46.900
I bring Chris and
you dance with me.

20:49.820 --> 20:51.220
One dance. No talking.

20:59.100 --> 21:02.700
So, uh... do you want to dance?

21:04.900 --> 21:06.420
Not really.

21:12.260 --> 21:14.340
But I can see someone who might.

21:17.540 --> 21:21.660
I might, um, go see who's over there.
-Yeah.

21:30.300 --> 21:31.460
Hi.

21:32.780 --> 21:34.860
You realize we've been set up.

21:34.940 --> 21:37.980
I was wondering why Karl was
so keen for me to come here.

21:38.980 --> 21:42.700
I'm not saying it's a problem,
unless you think that it is.

21:43.340 --> 21:45.700
No. It's fine.

21:50.020 --> 21:53.220
Can we, uh...
go outside and talk?

22:06.340 --> 22:07.660
Chris...

22:08.540 --> 22:09.980
I'm sorry I ran off.

22:10.060 --> 22:12.940
You don't have to apologize.

22:13.020 --> 22:15.500
I realize I was rushing you into
something you weren't ready for.

22:15.580 --> 22:17.300
No. That's not it.

22:17.380 --> 22:20.700
Oh, well, something
you're not interested in.

22:20.780 --> 22:22.060
Well, that's not it, either.

22:22.140 --> 22:24.700
So, you are interested?

22:24.780 --> 22:29.020
Yes... but it's complicated.

22:29.100 --> 22:30.340
Why?

22:30.420 --> 22:33.540
I mean, if we like each other,
then we like each other.

22:33.620 --> 22:34.980
That's simple, isn't it?

22:35.940 --> 22:36.940
Unless...

22:37.740 --> 22:40.540
you just want to be friends,
and that's okay, too.

22:47.340 --> 22:48.740
I'll see you at work.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.100
That's not what I want.

22:54.100 --> 22:55.420
What do you want?

23:08.660 --> 23:10.140
<i>* In this world *</i>

23:10.220 --> 23:11.780
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

23:11.860 --> 23:15.180
<i>* You know I love</i>
<i>My island home *</i>

23:15.260 --> 23:17.260
<i>* We'll make this right *</i>

23:17.340 --> 23:22.260
<i>* Find our way</i>
<i>Through this mystery *</i>

23:22.340 --> 23:23.860
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:23.940 --> 23:25.340
<i>* Swimming in the sea *</i>

23:25.420 --> 23:26.660
<i>* Now it's just you and me *</i>

23:26.740 --> 23:28.860
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:28.940 --> 23:30.460
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:30.540 --> 23:32.100
<i>* With you feeling free *</i>

23:32.180 --> 23:33.660
<i>* It's my destiny *</i>

23:33.740 --> 23:36.100
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:36.180 --> 23:37.700
<i>* Ooh ooh *</i>

23:37.780 --> 23:40.420
<i>* Ooh ooh ooh *</i>

23:40.500 --> 23:42.100
<i>* Ooh *</i>

23:42.180 --> 23:44.260
<i>* Ooh ooh *</i>

23:44.340 --> 23:47.020
<i>* Ooh ooh ooh *</i>

23:47.100 --> 23:48.500
<i>* Just be you and me *</i>

23:48.580 --> 23:50.340
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:50.420 --> 23:51.820
<i>* Swimming in the sea *</i>

23:51.900 --> 23:53.460
<i>* Now it's just you and me *</i>

23:53.540 --> 23:55.580
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:55.660 --> 23:57.060
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:57.140 --> 23:58.620
<i>* With you feeling free *</i>

23:58.700 --> 24:00.220
<i>* It's my destiny *</i>

24:00.300 --> 24:02.420
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

24:02.500 --> 24:04.020
<i>* Together *</i>

24:04.100 --> 24:05.740
<i>* Forever *</i>

24:05.820 --> 24:09.060
<i>* Together lying
in the sun *</i>

24:09.140 --> 24:10.620
<i>* Together *</i>

24:10.700 --> 24:12.260
<i>* Forever *</i>

24:12.340 --> 24:13.580
<i>* Together *</i>

24:13.660 --> 24:16.580
<i>* Just be you and me *</i>

24:18.620 --> 24:21.300
<i>* I just wanna be... *</i>
