00:01.436 --> 00:03.003
PREVIOUSLY ON "BATWOMAN"...

00:03.046 --> 00:05.353
QUITE FRANKLY
THE MAKEOVER THIS CITY NEEDS

00:05.396 --> 00:07.137
COMES FROM AN UGLY
I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

00:07.181 --> 00:10.227
I LOVE YOU SO M--

00:10.271 --> 00:11.750
OH, NO!

00:11.794 --> 00:14.362
WE ARE GOING TO GET
ANG BACK, OK?

00:14.405 --> 00:16.407
I KILLED OCEAN,

00:16.451 --> 00:18.975
AND I FELT...NOTHING.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.717
I'M ALIVE
AND VERY PISSED OFF.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.247
ANGELIQUE--
WHERE IS SHE?

00:30.291 --> 00:33.033
WAVE HELLO
TO YOUR FANS, ANGELIQUE.

00:33.076 --> 00:35.992
I NEED YOU TO WATCH
AS THESE TWO LET
ME GO.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.867
YOU TEAMING UP
WITH SOPHIE LIKE THIS--
IT'S A BAD IDEA, OK?

00:41.911 --> 00:44.348
SHE'S GONNA FIGURE
OUT WHO YOU ARE.
SHE'S SMART.

00:44.392 --> 00:46.655
-RYAN,
-I'M REALLY
MISSING MY BATSUIT RIGHT NOW.

00:46.698 --> 00:47.917
OH, MY GOD.

00:54.010 --> 00:56.099
MASKS HAVE TAKEN ON...

00:56.143 --> 00:58.536
VARIOUS MEANINGS OVER TIME.

01:01.017 --> 01:05.021
DECEIT, DISGUISE,

01:05.065 --> 01:07.850
CHEAP ENTERTAINMENT,

01:07.893 --> 01:09.721
BUT AS JUNG ONCE SAID,

01:09.765 --> 01:11.462
WE ALL WEAR MASKS,

01:11.506 --> 01:15.466
BOTH TO CREATE
AN IMPRESSION
UPON OTHERS

01:15.510 --> 01:19.122
BUT ALSO TO HIDE
OUR OWN TRUE NATURES.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.819
♪ STAY AWAKE

01:20.863 --> 01:22.386
♪ OOH, OOH, OOH

01:22.430 --> 01:25.302
GOOD EVENING, MR. SIONIS.

01:25.346 --> 01:32.918
♪ WILL YOU FOLLOW ME
INTO THE DARK? ♪

01:32.962 --> 01:37.836

HMM. THOUGH MAKING
PEOPLE LOOK THEIR BEST
IS MY SPECIALTY,

01:43.973 --> 01:48.586
I THINK THIS JUST
SO HAPPENS TO BE
MY MASTERPIECE.

01:48.630 --> 01:51.676
FOR GENERATIONS,
EVERY SIONIS...

01:51.720 --> 01:55.027
HAS HAD
A REPLICA MASK

01:55.071 --> 01:57.160
DECORATING THEIR CASKET.

02:00.859 --> 02:02.818
I EXHUMED THIS ONE...

02:02.861 --> 02:05.995
FROM THE COFFIN
OF MY DEARLY
DEPARTED DAUGHTER,

02:06.038 --> 02:09.825
ONCE DEAD,
NOW ON THE VERGE
OF REBIRTH.

02:09.868 --> 02:14.308
MY NAME IS KATE KANE.

02:16.310 --> 02:20.052
NO. NO. UGH!

02:24.448 --> 02:27.451
DR. RHYME,
IF YOU WOULD.

02:27.495 --> 02:30.933
MS. KANE,
OUR THERAPY HAS COME

02:30.976 --> 02:32.587
TO AN END POINT.

02:32.630 --> 02:35.807
ON MY CUE,
YOU WILL REMEMBER

02:35.851 --> 02:38.941
NOTHING OF YOUR LIFE
BEFORE TODAY.

02:38.984 --> 02:41.335
YOUR ONLY MEMORIES
WILL BE THOSE

02:41.378 --> 02:45.295
OF CIRCE SIONIS.

02:45.339 --> 02:47.906
NO. N--

02:52.215 --> 02:53.477
NO!

02:54.652 --> 02:55.914
UGH!

03:00.832 --> 03:03.095
I MUST WARN YOU, ROMAN.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.359
WHILE PSYCHOLOGICALLY
AND BEHAVIORALLY

03:05.402 --> 03:07.230
SHE IS YOUR DAUGHTER,

03:07.274 --> 03:09.406
THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD
DO ABOUT HER VOICE.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.887
HER LARYNX WAS DAMAGED
BY YOUR MAN

03:11.930 --> 03:14.890
DURING THE KIDNAPPING
AND SUBSEQUENT TORTURE.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.152
HMM.

03:21.113 --> 03:23.768
♪ WILL YOU FOLLOW ME?

03:27.555 --> 03:30.210
WHAT THE HELL, DAD?
WHY AM I WEARING THIS MASK?

03:30.253 --> 03:32.777
DON'T YOU REMEMBER,
SWEETHEART?

03:32.821 --> 03:37.565
YOU WERE IN A TERRIBLE FIRE
WHEN YOU BROKE OUT OF ARKHAM.

03:37.608 --> 03:40.002
IT STILL FEELS
A LITTLE FUZZY.

03:40.045 --> 03:43.745
HMM. WELL, THINGS
WILL BECOME MORE
AND MORE CLEAR

03:43.788 --> 03:45.486
AS THE DAYS PASS.

03:45.529 --> 03:48.967
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
NOW THAT YOU HAVE THIS MASK

03:49.011 --> 03:52.797
NO ONE WILL EVER
HURT YOU AGAIN.

03:52.841 --> 03:54.146
HMM.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.031
OHH.

04:59.690 --> 05:02.432
YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE
FOR TURNDOWN SERVICE.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.521
WHERE IS HE?

05:04.565 --> 05:06.001
UNH!

05:08.786 --> 05:10.092
UGH!

05:12.312 --> 05:13.530
UNH!

05:40.775 --> 05:42.124
YES?

05:49.914 --> 05:52.134
AGENT TAVAROFF,
HEARD A RUMOR

05:52.177 --> 05:54.179
YOU GOT A DNA SAMPLE
FROM THE BAT.

05:54.223 --> 05:56.791
I'LL VERIFY YOUR RUMOR
IF YOU VERIFY MINE.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.446
WORD IS YOU WERE PRETTY TIGHT
WITH THE LAST ONE.

05:59.489 --> 06:01.273
WHAT'S YOUR POINT,
RUSSELL?

06:01.317 --> 06:03.319
OH, THAT YOU COULD SAVE
THE LAB A LOT OF TROUBLE

06:03.363 --> 06:05.234
IF YOU COULD GIVE US
THE NAME OF THIS ONE.

06:05.277 --> 06:08.193
HOW MANY RAPE KITS
HAVE TO GO TO THE BACK
OF THE LINE

06:08.237 --> 06:12.415
SO YOU CAN MAKE
A BIG SPLASH TO
BOOST YOUR CAREER?

06:12.459 --> 06:16.463
THE COMMANDER KNOW ABOUT YOU
SQUANDERING RESOURCES
LIKE THIS?

06:16.506 --> 06:18.682
HE'S THE ONE WHO
SIGNED OFF ON IT
ACTUALLY.

06:44.273 --> 06:46.580
COMMANDER?

06:46.623 --> 06:48.408
MOORE, WHAT CAN I
DO FOR YOU?

06:51.193 --> 06:54.239
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT VIGILANTES, SIR,

06:54.283 --> 06:56.328
BUT INSTEAD OF WASTING
OUR TIME WITH BATWOMAN,

06:56.372 --> 06:58.809
SHOULDN'T WE BE
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO BLACK MASK IS?

06:58.853 --> 07:01.682
WELL, WE WERE,
BUT BATWOMAN GOT
IN THE WAY OF THAT,

07:01.725 --> 07:03.727
RUINED OUR UNDERCOVER
OPERATION,

07:03.771 --> 07:06.643
AND COST US A CHANCE
TO TAKE DOWN BLACK MASK.

07:06.687 --> 07:08.428
SHE'S ON OUR SIDE,
COMMANDER.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.386
HEH. WELL, IF THAT
WERE TRUE,

07:10.430 --> 07:12.954
SHE WOULDN'T MIND BEING
ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS.

07:12.997 --> 07:16.087
IS THAT THE REAL REASON
YOU'RE DOING THIS?

07:16.131 --> 07:21.832
TRUST? OR IS IT BECAUSE
EVERY TIME YOU SEE HER
YOU THINK OF KATE?

07:23.355 --> 07:25.096
GET OUT OF MY OFFICE,
MOORE.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.491
-EXCUSE ME?
-YOU THINK A LITTLE FLING

07:28.535 --> 07:30.101
WITH MY DAUGHTER
5 YEARS AGO

07:30.145 --> 07:32.887
GIVES YOU PERMISSION
TO TELL ME HOW TO DO MY JOB?

07:32.930 --> 07:35.498
SIR, I--I DIDN'T MEAN
TO OVERSTEP.

07:35.542 --> 07:38.458
GET OUT OF MY OFFICE NOW.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.330
YES, SIR.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.874
WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME
RELIVE THIS?

08:03.918 --> 08:06.355
BLACK MASK KEPT TABS
ON HIS COOKHOUSES
WITH A VIDEO FEED,

08:06.398 --> 08:07.922
ALLOWED HIM AN EYE
ON THE COOKIE JAR

08:07.965 --> 08:09.532
WITHOUT ACTUALLY GETTING
HIS HAND CAUGHT IN IT.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.491
SMART, RIGHT? WRONG.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.623
BECAUSE THAT ALLOWS ME TO
TRACK THE INTERNET TRAFFIC.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.495
SO WE CAN TRACK IT
BACK TO THE CAMERA'S
IP ADDRESS

08:15.538 --> 08:17.061
TO GET THE LOCATION
OF THE COOKHOUSE

08:17.105 --> 08:18.759
WHERE ANGELIQUE IS
BEING HELD.

08:21.196 --> 08:23.415
NOT JUST A PRETTY FACE
HERE, PEOPLE.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.548
SEND THOSE COOKHOUSE COORDINATES
TO THE BATMOBILE.

08:25.592 --> 08:28.551
UH, I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S GONNA BE
YOUR FIRST STOP.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.379
SOMEBODY TURNED
ON THE BATSIGNAL.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.476
HI.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.130
IT'S NOT A PAGER.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.914
A LITTLE BUSY HERE.

08:43.958 --> 08:45.873
WELL, UNLESS YOU WANT TO
GIVE ME YOUR NAME AND NUMBER...

08:45.916 --> 08:47.614
UH-HUH.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

08:47.657 --> 08:50.181
FIRST OFF,
LOSE THE TUDE.

08:50.225 --> 08:52.009
I'M DOING YOU A FAVOR.

08:55.012 --> 08:57.145
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW
THE CROWS ARE IN THE PROCESS

08:57.188 --> 08:59.234
OF EXTRACTING YOUR
DNA PROFILE

08:59.277 --> 09:02.411
FROM BLOOD SPATTER FOUND
AT THE SNAKEBITE FACILITY.

09:02.454 --> 09:04.195
ONCE THEY HAVE THAT,
THEY'RE GONNA UPLOAD IT

09:04.239 --> 09:07.155
TO THE NATIONAL
DNA REGISTRY.

09:07.198 --> 09:10.332
OF COURSE, THEY'LL NEED
SOMETHING TO MATCH IT AGAINST,

09:10.375 --> 09:13.204
SO YOU SHOULD BE GOOD

09:13.248 --> 09:15.859
UNLESS OF COURSE YOU'VE
EVER BEEN IN THE SYSTEM.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.472
ANYTHING YOU WANT
TO TELL ME?

09:20.516 --> 09:23.911
OTHER THAN YOU NEED TO
DESTROY THAT SAMPLE?

09:23.954 --> 09:25.913
IT'S ALREADY BEING
PROCESSED.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.871
THEY'LL HAVE THE PROFILE
IN A FEW HOURS.

09:27.915 --> 09:30.395
ARREST WARRANT WON'T BE
LONG AFTER THAT.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.616
I BETTER USE WHAT TIME
I HAVE LEFT

09:33.660 --> 09:35.575
TO SAVE THE ONE PERSON
WHO HAD THE GUTS TO TESTIFY

09:35.618 --> 09:37.925
AGAINST BLACK MASK.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.361
REMEMBER HER?

09:43.104 --> 09:46.150
THE ONE THE CROWS WERE
SUPPOSED TO PROTECT?

09:48.196 --> 09:49.719
WAIT.

09:52.330 --> 09:54.202
I CAN'T MAKE
ANY PROMISES
ABOUT THE SAMPLE,

09:54.245 --> 09:56.465
BUT I'LL DO MY BEST.

09:56.508 --> 09:58.293
LET'S HOPE THAT'S ENOUGH.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.610
AM I CLOSE?
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.089
BATWOMAN, WE TOOK
A GROUP VOTE

10:12.133 --> 10:13.395
AND YOU NEED TO
COME HOME.

10:13.438 --> 10:15.179
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

10:15.223 --> 10:18.530
ANGELIQUE IS BEING HELD
SOMEWHERE IN THIS DUMP.

10:18.574 --> 10:21.403
AND WHILE WE
APPRECIATE THAT
SHE'S A FORMER FLAME,

10:21.446 --> 10:23.448
SOPHIE JUST DROPPED
AN A-BOMB.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.146
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO PRESERVE
YOUR IDENTITY.

10:25.189 --> 10:27.757
WE WILL ONCE I FIND
ANGELIQUE.

10:27.801 --> 10:30.586
DIDN'T SOPHIE JUST
SAY THAT WE ONLY HAD
A COUPLE MORE HOURS?

10:30.630 --> 10:31.848
YEAH. SO I GOT TO BE QUICK.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.241
OK. I'M JUST
GONNA SAY IT.

10:33.284 --> 10:34.677
FINDING ANGELIQUE IS NOT
WORTH THROWING

10:34.721 --> 10:36.940
THE BATLEGACY
DOWN THE DRAIN.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.420
EXCUSE ME?

10:38.463 --> 10:40.248
LOOK. I'M JUST SAYING
YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.816
BLACK MASK IS USING
ANGELIQUE TO COOK
SNAKEBITE, RIGHT?

10:42.859 --> 10:44.992
HE WENT THROUGH
A LOT OF TROUBLE FOR HER,

10:45.035 --> 10:47.211
SO I HIGHLY DOUBT HE'D JUST
KILL OFF HIS GOLDEN GOOSE
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

10:47.255 --> 10:48.909
PRIORITY NUMBER ONE
SHOULD BE SAVING THE FUTURE

10:48.952 --> 10:51.259
OF THE SYMBOL FOR YOUR SAKE
AND THE CITY'S, AND THEN--

10:51.302 --> 10:53.304
HOW ABOUT THIS?
YOU TWO CALL SOPHIE,

10:53.348 --> 10:55.742
Y'ALL PUT YOUR HEADS TOGETHER
AND SAVE MY FUTURE.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.831
I'LL BE HERE KICKING
SOME FALSE FACE ASS,

10:57.874 --> 10:59.659
SAVING MY PAST.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.446
I'LL CHECK IN LATER.

11:08.363 --> 11:10.844
OHH! STOP! AAH!

11:16.023 --> 11:20.157
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS,
BARBEQUE FOR ONE?

11:20.201 --> 11:23.857
BATTY, WHAT BRINGS
YOU HERE?

11:23.900 --> 11:26.816
OH. WAS IT THE ODOR?

11:26.860 --> 11:28.862
HONESTLY, I'VE BEEN
AT THIS SO LONG

11:28.905 --> 11:30.385
I CAN HARDLY SMELL IT.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.082
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

11:32.126 --> 11:33.823
THE FALSE FACE
KIDNAPPED A FRIEND,

11:33.867 --> 11:36.086
SO I'VE BEEN POPPING
BY THEIR KNOWN HIDEOUTS,

11:36.130 --> 11:38.045
SEEING IF SOMEONE
WOULD BE WILLING

11:38.088 --> 11:39.568
TO SPILL HIS
POSSIBLE LOCATION.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.613
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
THEY KIDNAPPED, TOO.

11:41.657 --> 11:45.008
REALLY? HER NAME
WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO BE--PBB--

11:45.052 --> 11:49.099
I DON'T KNOW--
ANGELIQUE BY CHANCE?

11:49.143 --> 11:51.232
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

11:51.275 --> 11:54.670
WELL, ACCORDING
TO MR. EXTRA CRISPY
OVER HERE,

11:54.714 --> 11:57.064
WHEN ANGELIQUE
COULDN'T CONJURE UP
THE SPECIAL SAUCE

11:57.107 --> 11:59.283
THAT GIVES SNAKEBITE
ITS BITE,

11:59.327 --> 12:01.285
BLACK MASK TOOK
HER PHONE AND USED IT

12:01.329 --> 12:03.635
TO TRACK DOWN
THE ACTUAL CHEF,

12:03.679 --> 12:07.074
WHO DOES KNOW ALL
11 HERBS AND SPICES.

12:07.117 --> 12:08.989
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT OCEAN.

12:09.032 --> 12:10.207
MM-HMM.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.079
I THOUGHT YOU KILLED HIM.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.733
HEH. WELL, THAT'S
COMPLETELY BESIDES
THE POINT.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.473
-WHICH IS?
-ANGELIQUE AND OCEAN

12:15.517 --> 12:17.258
ARE APPARENTLY BEING
HELD AT A PLACE

12:17.301 --> 12:18.781
THAT IS MORE FORTIFIED
THAN THIS ONE,

12:18.825 --> 12:21.088
AND QUITE FRANKLY,
I NEED BACKUP,

12:21.131 --> 12:22.785
BY WHICH I MEAN
SOMEONE TO STAND BEHIND

12:22.829 --> 12:25.701
SO THAT THE BULLETS
DON'T HIT MY VISAGE.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.269
DAMN.

12:28.312 --> 12:31.359
YOU'RE CRAZIER THAN
EVERYONE ALREADY THINKS.

12:31.402 --> 12:34.014
WELL, ENEMY OF MY ENEMY,
DOESN'T THAT MEAN--

12:34.057 --> 12:37.234
THAT YOU'RE STILL THE BITCH
WHO MURDERED MY MOM.

12:37.278 --> 12:40.063
TOUCHEÉ, BUT I'M ALSO
THE BITCH

12:40.107 --> 12:41.978
WHO KNOWS WHERE OUR
BELOVED COOKS ARE.

12:42.022 --> 12:43.371
UNH!

12:46.504 --> 12:50.204
THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS
AS OF NOW,

12:50.247 --> 12:52.946
AND AS MUCH AS OUR
DEARLY DEPARTED WAS
FORTHCOMING

12:52.989 --> 12:55.600
ABOUT THEIR LOCATION,
HE WASN'T AS CLEAR

12:55.644 --> 12:57.689
ABOUT HOW LONG
THEY'D STAY ALIVE.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.779
APPARENTLY, BLACK MASK
JUST WANTS THEM

12:59.822 --> 13:03.826
TO SPILL THE RECIPE,
SO THE CLOCK IS
TICK, TICK, TICKING.

13:03.870 --> 13:07.003
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
PARTNERS?

13:09.266 --> 13:11.965
THAT SILENCE SOUNDS
LIKE A FIRM YES.

13:14.315 --> 13:17.274
YOU CROSS ME,
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

13:17.318 --> 13:19.799
ABOUT BULLETS KILLING YOU.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.496
OK.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.936

ALWAYS WANTED TO RIDE

WE ARE NOT DOING THIS.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.651
WE ARE NOT GETTING
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.261
EVERYTHING I NEED

14:47.974 --> 14:49.671

14:52.152 --> 14:55.155
COMMANDER KANE
JUST WANTED AN UPDATE
ON THE BATWOMAN SAMPLE.

14:55.198 --> 14:58.114
YEAH? HE'S NOT
THE ONLY ONE.

14:58.158 --> 15:00.334
AGENT TAVAROFF WAS
JUST HERE CHECKING ON IT.

15:05.469 --> 15:09.473
DON'T WORRY. I'M GONNA
BABYSIT THIS THING
THE WHOLE WAY.

15:09.517 --> 15:12.346
HOW LONG
UNTIL IT'S READY?

15:12.389 --> 15:14.130
NOT MUCH LONGER.

15:20.223 --> 15:22.138
BLECH. YOU KNOW
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

15:22.182 --> 15:23.923
DEEP CLEAN
THE BATMOBILE NOW.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.359
OH, I AM WELL AWARE.

15:25.402 --> 15:27.056
OK. BASED ON THE TRAJECTORY,
THEY'RE HEADED

15:27.100 --> 15:28.536
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WATERFRONT.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.973
UGH. I GET THE APPEAL
OF ANGELIQUE

15:31.017 --> 15:33.410

ALICE? REALLY?

15:37.023 --> 15:38.589
DO WE EVEN KNOW
THIS ISN'T A TRAP?

15:38.633 --> 15:39.677
NOPE.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.595
TELL ME YOU DESTROYED IT.

15:44.639 --> 15:47.076
I CAN'T. TOO MANY EYES.
WE NEED A PLAN B.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.122
WHAT? SOPHIE? NO.
EVERY PLAN INVOLVES YOU

15:49.165 --> 15:50.862
DESTROYING THE DAMN SAMPLE!

15:50.906 --> 15:52.821
LOOK. MY ENTIRE OFFICE
IS ACTING LIKE

15:52.864 --> 15:54.910
THEY'RE SITTING
ON THE NUCLEAR CODES.

15:54.954 --> 15:58.131
I'D HAVE AN EASIER TIME
SWIPING RECORDS OUT
OF AREA 51.

15:58.174 --> 16:00.916
THERE ARE ONLY
78 MORE MINUTES TILL
THEY GET HER PROFILE.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.396
THEN THEY'RE GONNA
UPLOAD IT

16:02.439 --> 16:06.008
TO THE NATIONAL
DNA DATABASE, AND...

16:06.052 --> 16:09.881
AND IF SHE'S EVER
BEEN ENTERED IN THERE
FOR ANY REASON EVER,

16:09.925 --> 16:12.275
SUCH AS AN ARREST,
THEY'RE GONNA GET A MATCH,

16:12.319 --> 16:15.409
AND THE WHOLE WORLD
WILL KNOW BATWOMAN'S
IDENTITY.

16:15.452 --> 16:17.019
I GOT TO GO. BYE.

16:20.631 --> 16:21.937
OHH.

16:38.432 --> 16:41.043
HOW DO YOU KNOW
FALSE FACE WAS
TELLING YOU THE TRUTH?

16:41.087 --> 16:42.436
WELL, IT'S HARD TO LIE
THROUGH YOUR TEETH

16:42.479 --> 16:44.307
WHEN THEY'VE ALL
BEEN YANKED OUT.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.677
EVERYBODY READY

MAKING SNAKEBITE" TAKE ONE.

17:16.078 --> 17:19.168
AND...ACTION.

17:25.957 --> 17:27.263
TAKE TWO.

17:27.307 --> 17:29.091
THERE WILL NOT BE
A TAKE 3.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.584
ONE SENTRY.

17:43.627 --> 17:46.500
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
TRYING TO KEEP
A LOW PROFILE.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.806
I WANT TO SEE.

17:48.850 --> 17:51.766
WHY DON'T I GET
ANY BATTOYS?

17:51.809 --> 17:53.463
CAN I LEAST HAVE
A BATARANG?

17:53.507 --> 17:56.858
OK. YOU DRAW HIM OUT,
I'LL TAKE HIM OUT.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.729
THINK YOU CAN
HANDLE THAT?

17:58.773 --> 18:00.079
SURE.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.126
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

18:04.170 --> 18:06.172
-WHAT YOU ASKED.
-I TOLD YOU TO DRAW HIM OUT,

18:06.215 --> 18:07.912
NOT DRAW HIM TO US.

18:07.956 --> 18:10.872
AND I DELIVERED.
YOUR MOVE, LOVER GIRL.

18:17.618 --> 18:18.967
UGH!

18:20.403 --> 18:22.362
UNH! AGH!

18:24.712 --> 18:26.757
SEE? THAT WORKED OUT
SPLENDIDLY.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.019
THERE THEY ARE!

18:29.760 --> 18:31.632
MIGHT WANT TO GIVE ME
THAT BATARANG NOW.

18:43.644 --> 18:46.734
HEY.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.562
GOT YOU A PREZZIE.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.781
MARY, KIND OF
BUSY RIGHT NOW.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.609
-I CAN'T REALLY DO--
-IT'S NOT FROM ME.

18:52.653 --> 18:55.308
IT'S FROM SOMEONE
WHO KNOWS HOW HARD
YOU ARE TO SHOP FOR,

18:55.351 --> 18:58.659
AND HE GOT YOU THIS.

19:05.013 --> 19:06.928
IT'S A TARGETED
KILL DRIVE.

19:06.971 --> 19:09.060
YOUR LAB IS TURNING
BATWOMAN'S DNA EVIDENCE

19:09.104 --> 19:10.801
INTO A BUNCH
OF ONES AND ZEROES,

19:10.845 --> 19:13.064
AND THAT GUY WILL REARRANGE
THOSE ONES AND ZEROES,

19:13.108 --> 19:14.457
MAKING IT UNREADABLE.

19:16.459 --> 19:19.680
DIDN'T KNOW YOU
WERE ON BATWOMAN'S
PAYROLL, AS WELL.

19:19.723 --> 19:24.206
OH. HUH? NO. LUKE JUST
ASKED ME AS A FAVOR

19:24.250 --> 19:27.601
BECAUSE WE HANG OUT
CASUALLY AS FRIENDS.

19:27.644 --> 19:28.906
UH-HUH.

19:30.517 --> 19:31.953
YEAH.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.436
SO ACCORDING
TO THE BAT TEAM

19:36.479 --> 19:38.220
IF I USE THIS DEVICE,
THEN WHEN THE FILE

19:38.264 --> 19:39.830
IS TRANSMITTED
TO THE DNA REGISTRY

19:39.874 --> 19:41.223
IT WON'T MATCH
ANYTHING?

19:41.267 --> 19:43.965
-YEAH.
-THAT'S PRETTY CLEVER.

19:44.008 --> 19:47.011
SO DID LUKE INCLUDE
AN INSTRUCTION MANUAL?

19:47.055 --> 19:49.362
NO, BUT HE IS AVAILABLE
FOR TECH SUPPORT.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.886
YOU JUST HAVE TO PLUG
THAT LITTLE CUTIE

19:51.929 --> 19:55.150
INTO ANY COMPUTER
IN THE BUILDING
WITH TIER ONE ACCESS.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.283
HEH. TIER ONE ACCESS?

19:57.326 --> 19:59.850
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON
WITH THAT.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.159
YOUR DAD'S BEEN HOLED UP
IN THERE FOR HOURS.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.684
HOW THE HELL DO YOU
EXPECT ME TO GET
HIM TO LEAVE?

20:07.728 --> 20:09.599
WHY DO YOU THINK I'M HERE?

20:24.440 --> 20:28.575
UNH! UNH! UNH! UNH!

20:28.618 --> 20:31.795
AHH.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.841
WE MAKE A SHOCKINGLY
GOOD TEAM,

20:33.884 --> 20:35.625
AND BY WE, I MEAN
YOUR CAR AND I.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.627
WHERE ARE THE COOKS
BEING HELD ON THE BOAT?

20:37.671 --> 20:39.673
BECAUSE I'M GONNA
TELL YOU?

20:39.716 --> 20:42.719
YOUR BAD.
SHE WAS THE NICE ONE.

20:42.763 --> 20:44.634
WHERE ARE THE COOKS?

20:44.678 --> 20:46.201
UPPER DECK. UPPER DECK.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.464
IF THEY WERE HARMED
IN ANY WAY,

20:48.508 --> 20:51.293
I SWEAR TO YOU ON MY
HEADLESS MOTHER'S GRAVE--

20:51.337 --> 20:53.252
UNH!

20:55.689 --> 20:57.778
HE JUST PASSED OUT.

20:57.821 --> 21:00.781
OH, MY GOD.
YOU LOVE HIM.

21:00.824 --> 21:02.478
I JUST KICKED HIM
FOR NO REASON.

21:02.522 --> 21:04.872
-NOT HIM. OCEAN.
-OCEAN? WHAT?

21:04.915 --> 21:07.135
N-NO.

21:07.178 --> 21:08.484
IS THAT YOUR
BOYFRIEND?

21:08.528 --> 21:10.269
I DROVE A KNIFE
THROUGH HIS HEART.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.227
WELL, FOR YOU,
THAT'S NOT A NO.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.404
OH. THAT'S TRUE.

21:15.448 --> 21:18.320
I HAD A BIT OF A BREAKTHROUGH
AT YESTERDAY'S THERAPY SESSION,

21:18.364 --> 21:20.627
ALTHOUGH IT WOULD APPEAR
ALL THE UNRESOLVED FEELINGS

21:20.670 --> 21:23.543
I HAVE FOR HIM THAT
I THOUGHT I RESOLVED
IN KILLING HIM

21:23.586 --> 21:27.286
ARE, AS OF YET,
UNFORTUNATELY STILL
ON THE TABLE.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.636
LAST NIGHT'S--AHEM--
STEAMY TRYST

21:29.679 --> 21:33.161
MADE IT ALL
THE MORE CONFUSING.

21:33.204 --> 21:35.294
THAT'S WHY YOU NEEDED
MY HELP,

21:35.337 --> 21:37.600
TO MAKE SURE HE MAKES
IT OUT OF THIS ALIVE.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.344
FOLLOW ME.
STAY CLOSE.

22:06.412 --> 22:09.632
ALMOST THROUGH
WITH THE COOK, SIR.

22:09.676 --> 22:11.547
I HAVE TO ADMIT
I'M QUITE PLEASED

22:11.591 --> 22:13.593
WITH THE PERFORMANCES.

22:13.636 --> 22:16.596
NUANCE IS EVERYTHING
THESE DAYS.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.337
OCEAN,
SLOW DOWN.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.426
BUY OURSELVES
AS MUCH TIME
AS POSSIBLE.

22:20.469 --> 22:21.644
-WOMAN,
-GOT
A PERIMETER BREACH

22:21.688 --> 22:23.167
AT THE NORTH DOCKS.

22:23.211 --> 22:24.517
WHAT IS IT?

22:24.560 --> 22:25.996
APPARENTLY,
WE GOT COMPANY.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.389
WOMAN,
LOOKS LIKE BATWOMAN.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.913
WHAT?!

22:29.957 --> 22:32.133
AND SHE'S WITH
THAT BITCH ALICE.

22:32.176 --> 22:36.355
WE NEED BACKUP
AT THE NORTH DOCK NOW.

22:36.398 --> 22:39.532
HOW WILL WE PASS
THE TIME?

22:39.575 --> 22:41.708
QUIETLY WOULD BE
MY FIRST CHOICE.

22:41.751 --> 22:46.147
I LIKE YOU.
YOU'RE FUN BUT MEAN.

22:46.190 --> 22:48.323
YOU SURE THIS
ANGELIQUE CHICK IS
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?

22:48.367 --> 22:50.717
SHE IS. THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CONCERN.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.589
IS SHE, THOUGH?
I MEAN, CITY HERO,
DRUG DEALER.

22:53.633 --> 22:56.984
DOESN'T EXACTLY SCREAM
ROYAL WEDDING.

22:57.027 --> 22:59.378
YOU ASKING FOR A FRIEND...

22:59.421 --> 23:02.903
OR ARE YOU ASKING
BECAUSE YOU ACCIDENTALLY

23:02.946 --> 23:05.558
HAVE FEELINGS FOR SOMEONE
AND IT TERRIFIES YOU?

23:07.690 --> 23:12.826
BECAUSE...HOW COULD
ANYONE EVER LOVE A MONSTER

23:12.869 --> 23:14.741
WHO WATCHED HER GANG
KILL A WOMAN

23:14.784 --> 23:17.178
AND NOT EVEN WONDER
HER NAME?

23:20.268 --> 23:22.618
OBVIOUSLY ASKING
FOR A FRIEND.

23:22.662 --> 23:24.446
HEH HEH.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.275
ANGELIQUE WAS THE ONLY
PERSON IN OUR GROUP HOME

23:27.318 --> 23:29.451
WHO EVER HAD MY BACK.

23:32.323 --> 23:35.457
I SEE.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.503
SO YOU WERE PLUCKED
AWAY LIKE

23:37.546 --> 23:41.942
THE LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE
WHILE SHE WAS LEFT BEHIND.

23:41.985 --> 23:46.294
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
SO DETERMINED TO SAVE
HER NOW, ISN'T IT?

23:46.337 --> 23:50.559
GUILT. HA HA HA!

23:50.603 --> 23:52.909
WHERE HAVE I HEARD
THAT BEFORE?

23:52.953 --> 23:56.478
ECH. YOUR PREDECESSOR
WAS OBSESSED
WITH SAVING ME.

23:56.522 --> 24:00.221
SHE COULDN'T ACCEPT
REALITY AND MOVE ON.

24:00.264 --> 24:04.443
POOR THING DIDN'T
REALIZE UNTIL IT WAS
TOO LATE...

24:04.486 --> 24:06.140
AND THEN SHE DIED.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.277
JUST A LITTLE
PIECE OF ADVICE

24:13.321 --> 24:16.890
FROM AN ANTIHERO
TO A HERO.

24:16.933 --> 24:21.590
YOU CAN'T SAVE
EVERYONE,

24:21.634 --> 24:24.027
NOT WITHOUT LOSING
WHO YOU ARE.

24:25.768 --> 24:29.511
GO! LET'S GO!

24:29.555 --> 24:31.557
THEY'RE AT THE NORTH DOCKS.

24:38.738 --> 24:40.435
IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO KNOW WHO I AM,

24:40.479 --> 24:42.872
YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS
ABOUT ME.

24:42.916 --> 24:46.136
I AM SOMEONE
WHO NEVER FORGETS.

24:51.228 --> 24:52.795
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:52.839 --> 24:54.318
OH, DON'T WORRY.

24:54.362 --> 24:58.061
I'M GONNA SAVE OCEAN...
FROM YOU.

24:58.105 --> 25:02.805
I AM GOING TO
MAKE SURE HE KNOWS
EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.557
AND...CUT.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.518
THAT'S A WRAP.

25:31.312 --> 25:33.053
BATWOMAN TO BATCAVE.

25:33.096 --> 25:35.534
I'M IN, BUT...

25:35.577 --> 25:38.362
KIND OF GOT
A MAZE SITUATION GOING HERE.

25:41.452 --> 25:43.411
UH, HEAD TO THE LEFT.

25:43.454 --> 25:45.326
THERE SHOULD BE
A STAIRWELL IN
THE NORTHEAST CORNER.

25:45.369 --> 25:47.067
COPY.

25:51.593 --> 25:53.334
HEY.
HEY. SO THE LAB'S

25:53.377 --> 25:55.205
ABOUT TO UPLOAD
BATWOMAN'S DNA
TO THE MAINFRAME.

25:55.249 --> 25:56.903
TALK ME THROUGH THIS.

25:56.946 --> 25:58.426
AS SOON AS THE FILE'S
UPLOADED,

25:58.469 --> 26:00.080
CLICK ON BATWOMAN'S
PROFILE.

26:00.123 --> 26:01.603
IT'LL SHRED THAT BABY
TO HIGH-TECH RIBBONS.

26:01.647 --> 26:04.040
-THAT'S IT?
-THAT'S IT.

26:15.312 --> 26:17.227
LET'S HOPE THIS
WAS WORTH THE WAIT.

26:19.665 --> 26:24.408
AND...THEY'RE STARTING
THE UPLOAD NOW.

26:24.452 --> 26:28.108
OK. HERE IT COMES.

26:28.151 --> 26:30.545
-OH, NO.
-WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED?

26:30.589 --> 26:32.721
IT'S NOT JUST BATWOMAN'S FILE.

26:32.765 --> 26:34.593
THEY'RE UPLOADING
DNA PROFILES FROM DOZENS

26:34.636 --> 26:36.595
OF CROWS INVESTIGATIONS.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.118
YOU CAN'T SINGLE
HERS OUT?

26:38.161 --> 26:39.510
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
THEY MADE THE FILE LABELS

26:39.554 --> 26:40.947
NUMBERS FOR ANONYMITY.

26:40.990 --> 26:42.513
THERE ARE NO NAMES,

26:42.557 --> 26:46.126
MEANING THERE'S NO WAY
TO TELL THEM APART.

26:46.169 --> 26:49.216
THE ONLY WAY TO GET
BATWOMAN'S WOULD BE
TO CORRUPT THEM ALL.

26:49.259 --> 26:51.174
HOW SERIOUS
ARE THESE CASES?

26:51.218 --> 26:54.395
THIS BEING GOTHAM,
WE CAN BE DAMN SURE
IT'S NOT FOR JAYWALKING.

26:56.963 --> 26:58.878
IF WE DID THIS,

26:58.921 --> 27:01.663
WE WOULDN'T JUST BE
PROTECTING BATWOMAN.

27:01.707 --> 27:04.797
WE WOULD BE PROTECTING
RAPISTS AND MURDERERS.

27:07.495 --> 27:09.149
WE CAN'T DO IT, LUKE.

27:09.192 --> 27:12.065
WHAT ABOUT BATWOMAN,
SOPHIE?

27:12.108 --> 27:13.762
THE RESULTS WILL BE
BACK IN A MATTER
OF MINUTES.

27:13.806 --> 27:15.895
WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

27:15.938 --> 27:17.636
I MIGHT HAVE AN IDEA.

27:23.946 --> 27:25.513
WHAT IS THIS?

27:25.556 --> 27:27.428
GUESS WHO PASSED
THE HEALTH INSPECTION

27:27.471 --> 27:31.693
WITH FLYING COLORS. HA!

27:31.737 --> 27:33.956
LAST TIME WE SPOKE,
I GOT THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION

27:34.000 --> 27:36.567
YOU HAD NO INTEREST
IN LEGITIMIZING
THIS PLACE.

27:36.611 --> 27:40.049
I DIDN'T,
BUT I DO CARE
ABOUT STAYING OPEN

27:40.093 --> 27:41.921
AND YOU KEEPING
YOUR GUYS OUT
OF MY HAIR,

27:41.964 --> 27:45.751
SO CONSIDER THIS...
A COMPROMISE.

27:45.794 --> 27:48.928
WOW. I'M IMPRESSED.

27:48.971 --> 27:50.843
WE'VE GOT
UP-TO-CODE STORAGE,

27:50.886 --> 27:52.540
CERTIFIED NURSES
AND DOCTORS.

27:52.583 --> 27:55.108
SAD TO SAY, THAT
LEAVES ME INSIDE
MOST DAYS

27:55.151 --> 27:56.631
DOING PAPERWORK.

27:59.765 --> 28:03.377
-YOU OK?
-HMM?

28:03.420 --> 28:04.900
YOU'RE SWEATING.
HERE.

28:04.944 --> 28:08.425
YEAH. NO. I'M--
I'M FINE.

28:08.469 --> 28:12.299
SO WHAT HAPPENS
IF SOMEONE WALKS IN
WITH A GUNSHOT WOUND

28:12.342 --> 28:15.694
THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO REPORT TO GCPD?

28:15.737 --> 28:19.001
WELL...I DO WHAT
THE REGULATIONS SAY.

28:19.045 --> 28:21.961
I FILL OUT
THIS THINGY,

28:22.004 --> 28:24.137
AND I FAX IT
TO THE GCPD USING

28:24.180 --> 28:26.487
THIS RIDICULOUS
MONSTROSITY,

28:26.530 --> 28:29.708
WHICH I'M PRETTY SURE
IS TWICE AS OLD AS I AM.

28:29.751 --> 28:32.536
THIS AN OVERSIGHT?

28:32.580 --> 28:39.065
UH...WELL, NO ONE
EVER TAUGHT ME HOW
TO SEND A TELEGRAPH

28:39.108 --> 28:41.502
OR A FAX
OR WHATEVER THEY ARE,

28:41.545 --> 28:44.548
AND THERE'S N-NOTHING
IN THE REGULATIONS

28:44.592 --> 28:46.637
THAT REQUIRES ME
TO HIRE AN I.T. GUY.

28:46.681 --> 28:49.118
SO YOU FIGURED OUT
YOUR WORKAROUND.

28:49.162 --> 28:50.903
COMPROMISE WORKS
BOTH WAYS.

28:50.946 --> 28:52.295
WELL, THEN AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED,

28:52.339 --> 28:53.688
YOU'RE CLEAR TO
OPEN SHOP.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.951
-I NEED TO GET GOING.
-WH--

28:55.995 --> 28:57.953
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
SERIOUSLY,

28:57.997 --> 28:59.825
YOU DO GET THAT
WE'RE BASICALLY

28:59.868 --> 29:02.610
TREATING AND HARBORING
POTENTIAL CRIMINALS HERE.

29:02.653 --> 29:04.525
WELL, IF IT MEANS YOU'LL
START TAKING MY CALLS AGAIN,

29:04.568 --> 29:06.570
I DON'T NEED TO KNOW
THAT THAT THING IS
NOT PLUGGED IN.

29:06.614 --> 29:09.443
I'LL--I'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER.

29:09.486 --> 29:10.705
UH!

29:12.794 --> 29:16.015
HUH. WELL, THAT WORKED.

29:39.038 --> 29:42.693
WHERE'S BATWOMAN?

29:42.737 --> 29:46.959
FINALLY, A MEMBER
OF THIS LAME SOCIETY
WHO'S ACTUALLY TRYING.

29:47.002 --> 29:49.091
LOVE THIS. IS IT OAK?

30:04.150 --> 30:06.108
YOU CAN FIND HER
ON THE DECK.

30:06.152 --> 30:08.371
I'LL BE BACK FOR YOU.

30:10.504 --> 30:12.375
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.169
OK.
A FEW MORE MINUTES,

30:23.212 --> 30:26.041
AND THE WORLD WILL KNOW
THE NAME BEHIND THE BAT.

30:26.085 --> 30:28.565
DIBS ON ARRESTING
HER ASS BY THE WAY. HEH.

30:42.014 --> 30:43.624
COME ON, COME ON.

30:43.667 --> 30:46.061
COME ON,

30:47.802 --> 30:49.543
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

30:49.586 --> 30:52.024
ALL RIGHTIE.
WHO'S READY FOR THIS?

30:52.067 --> 30:53.895
BETTING WINDOWS
ARE CLOSED.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.550
THE IDENTITY
OF BATWOMAN 2.0 IS...

30:58.595 --> 31:01.381
NONE FOUND? WHAT--
WHAT THE?

31:03.470 --> 31:05.385
THIS IS B.S.

31:05.428 --> 31:07.213
HOW COULD SHE NOT BE
IN THE SYSTEM?

31:07.256 --> 31:09.955
UH-OH.

31:09.998 --> 31:12.174
DID SOMEONE SEND OUT
INVITES TO A PARTY

31:12.218 --> 31:15.221
BEFORE THEY FOUND OUT
IF THERE WAS A PARTY?

31:17.788 --> 31:19.094
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

31:19.138 --> 31:20.835
BACK TO WORK.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.798
TELL BATWOMAN
SHE'S GOOD.

31:27.842 --> 31:29.191
WHAT DID YOU DO?

31:29.235 --> 31:31.237
IT'S HANDLED.
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

31:31.280 --> 31:32.934
NOW I GOT TO DELETE
MY DIGITAL FOOTPRINT

31:32.978 --> 31:35.415
SO THE COMMANDER NEVER
FINDS OUT ABOUT THIS.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.116
LOOK, DUDE.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO KILL US.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.857
WE CAN MAKE AS MANY
BATCHES AS YOU WANT.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.946
SHE'S RIGHT, MAN.
WATCHING A HOW-TO VIDEO

31:44.990 --> 31:46.339
ISN'T THE REAL THING.

31:46.382 --> 31:47.644
THERE'S A MILLION
VARIABLES--

31:47.688 --> 31:48.863
POTENCY OF THE FEAR TOXIN,

31:48.907 --> 31:51.126
MUSHROOM OIL--OHH!

31:51.170 --> 31:52.562
WHAT THE HELL, MAN?

31:58.090 --> 32:00.962
STOP.

32:01.006 --> 32:02.224
WAIT.

32:02.268 --> 32:04.009
YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT.

32:04.052 --> 32:06.054
WHAT? THIS?

32:16.369 --> 32:17.979
HOW DID YOU FIND US?

32:18.023 --> 32:20.503
YOUR GIRL RYAN
SENDS HER LOVE.

32:21.983 --> 32:24.029
-CAN YOU WALK?
-GO WITHOUT ME.

32:24.072 --> 32:25.813
DUDE, NO. YOU'RE
COMING WITH US.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.641
COME ON, COME ON!

32:29.730 --> 32:32.689
HEY. YOU'RE GONNA
GET OUT OF HERE.

32:32.733 --> 32:36.650

THAT GIRL YOU WON'T
SHUT UP ABOUT, OK?

32:36.693 --> 32:40.393
YEAH. GO FIND
YOUR GIRL.

32:40.436 --> 32:42.047

THE BACK,

32:42.090 --> 32:43.526

32:43.570 --> 32:45.267

ABOUT YOUR DAD LATELY?

36:26.445 --> 36:27.968
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

36:28.011 --> 36:29.709
I MEAN HIS DEMEANOR.

36:29.752 --> 36:32.190
ANY MOOD SWINGS,
HEALTH ISSUES?

36:32.233 --> 36:34.453
HE SEEMED FINE
WHEN I SAW HIM TODAY.

36:34.496 --> 36:37.934
I MEAN, HE SIGNED OFF
ON THE PLACE.

36:37.978 --> 36:40.415
HE EVEN SAW
THE FAX MACHINE.

36:40.459 --> 36:43.288
-WHAT FAX MACHINE?
-THE ONE THAT'S

36:43.331 --> 36:45.812
NOT PLUGGED IN THAT
KEEPS US FROM HAVING TO

36:52.471 --> 36:54.429
YEAH.

36:54.473 --> 36:56.953
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
ALL THESE QUESTIONS?

37:00.914 --> 37:03.177
I FOUND THIS
IN HIS OFFICE.

37:06.354 --> 37:08.835
HE PROBABLY SEIZED IT
ON A BUST.

37:08.878 --> 37:11.925
WOULDN'T IT BE
IN EVIDENCE THEN?

37:11.968 --> 37:15.798

YOUR DAD BLEW UP
AT ME TODAY OUT
OF NOWHERE.

37:19.367 --> 37:21.369
HE KICKED ME OUT
OF HIS OFFICE.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.893
THEN I FOUND THIS
A FEW HOURS LATER.

37:23.937 --> 37:26.331
IT SORT OF JUST SOUNDS
LIKE MY DAD.

37:26.374 --> 37:30.596
SOPH, YOU CAN'T BE
SERIOUS.

37:30.639 --> 37:33.512
YOU SHOULD TALK
TO HIM, MARY.

37:33.555 --> 37:39.082
MY DAD IS NOT DOING
SNAKEBITE.

37:39.126 --> 37:41.476
THEN IT SHOULD BE
A SHORT CONVERSATION,

37:41.520 --> 37:43.522

YOU NEED TO HAVE IT.

38:02.410 --> 38:05.326

TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY,
TO FEEL LIKE I MATTER,

38:29.437 --> 38:32.092

EVERYTHING COULD BE
