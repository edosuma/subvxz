WEBVTT

00:13.847 --> 00:14.931
Meow.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.100
[Douxie whistling]

00:17.434 --> 00:18.935
[theme music playing]

00:48.089 --> 00:53.011
[Merlin's voice] <i>I fear it's not</i>
<i>a question of where, but rather when.</i>

00:55.764 --> 00:58.099
Welcome back to the 21st century!

00:58.183 --> 01:01.144
Ah! Sweet, sweet pollution.
How I missed you!

01:01.227 --> 01:02.812
[inhales, coughs]

01:02.896 --> 01:06.066
-[phone chimes]
-Heh! And reception! Hot dang!

01:06.149 --> 01:07.567
-[chiming continues]
-So many messages.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.944
[yelling]

01:10.028 --> 01:11.071
Jim!

01:11.154 --> 01:12.822
Hold on, please!

01:12.906 --> 01:15.450
Man, oh, man! Can this get any worse?

01:18.912 --> 01:20.705
[screams]

01:20.789 --> 01:23.041
[whimpers]

01:23.124 --> 01:25.627
[Merlin] We must escape the Arcane Order!

01:25.710 --> 01:27.170
Camelot is lost!

01:27.253 --> 01:29.339
Does this castle have
any safety features?

01:29.422 --> 01:33.968
Yes. I designed a state-of-the-art
crashing mechanism.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.263
[crashing]

01:38.014 --> 01:39.557
[grunting]

01:40.475 --> 01:41.851
-Need a lift?
-Douxie!

01:41.935 --> 01:44.312
-But you're trapped in the past!
-Not anymore.

01:44.395 --> 01:45.688
Took you long enough.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.899
-We have much to talk about.
-[Toby grunts]

01:47.982 --> 01:50.235
Oh, no, Jimbo!
What's happening to him?

01:50.318 --> 01:52.320
The shard, it's moving to his heart.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.614
I'm getting everyone home safe,
as promised.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.241
Not yet! We're missing one!

01:56.533 --> 01:58.159
Merlin!

02:13.633 --> 02:16.052
-[sighs]
-Star light, star bright,

02:16.136 --> 02:17.929
grant me this wish by night:

02:18.179 --> 02:21.099
that I'll never have to go
back to school.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.812
[crashing]

02:27.230 --> 02:28.773
I have magic powers!

02:28.857 --> 02:31.442
-Oh, I also wish for eye lasers!
-[car alarm blaring]

02:31.526 --> 02:34.946
[grunting] Oh!

02:37.824 --> 02:40.994
[chuckles] I guess school's out
for the ever.

02:41.452 --> 02:43.663
Aw, man, I never cleaned out my locker!

02:43.746 --> 02:46.916
Your beautiful school home was crushed.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.836
So... [chuckles] now that
we've cheated death, quick Q.

02:49.919 --> 02:51.880
-Who's the little magic plant lady?
-Nari.

02:51.963 --> 02:56.634
She renounced the Arcane Order
and sought asylum in Camelot.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.887
[grunting]

02:59.012 --> 03:01.306
[yelling]

03:01.389 --> 03:02.724
Jim! Hold on!

03:02.807 --> 03:06.185
Poor soul. Your corruption...

03:06.519 --> 03:08.813
-[gasps] I feel it worsening!
-[gasps]

03:08.897 --> 03:11.608
Jim hurt. Dying.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.234
There has to be something we can do.

03:13.318 --> 03:16.738
I told you nine centuries ago,
there isn't.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.156
You remember what happened?

03:18.239 --> 03:21.659
Like it was yesterday,
which, for you, it was.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.203
I know it was a hard choice,

03:24.287 --> 03:28.041
but you did the right thing
for the sake of the world.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.042
[castle whooshes]

03:29.334 --> 03:31.920
-[Jim screams]
-[Claire] We've gotta get him out of here!

03:32.003 --> 03:34.756
Stop! The shard's creeping
towards his heart again!

03:34.839 --> 03:39.594
Nari, come back to us
and finish the work you have begun!

03:39.677 --> 03:42.889
You misunderstand our grand vision.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.766
They are under our protection.

03:44.849 --> 03:48.269
If you want them,
you've gotta get through us!

03:49.103 --> 03:50.605
So be it.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.571
[grunts, yells]

04:00.698 --> 04:02.075
[Toby grunting]

04:02.158 --> 04:04.577
[Steve yelling, squeals]

04:04.661 --> 04:07.205
[Aaarrrgghh roars, grunts]

04:07.288 --> 04:09.832
[Green Knight] Nari, Trollhunter,

04:09.916 --> 04:12.627
you are mine.

04:15.797 --> 04:16.965
[grunting]

04:17.048 --> 04:18.967
[roars]

04:19.759 --> 04:22.011
-[guitar riff plays]
-[grunts]

04:23.304 --> 04:24.305
[yells]

04:27.016 --> 04:28.184
[both grunt]

04:35.108 --> 04:36.985
-[groans]
-[Merlin] We're outmatched!

04:37.068 --> 04:38.278
Everyone, fall back!

04:38.361 --> 04:39.696
[Douxie] He's unstoppable.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.700
We need an edge.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.994
I'm sorry, Claire. [screams]

04:46.577 --> 04:49.163
No! You can't! Jim!

04:49.247 --> 04:52.959
-It's the only way!
-No! No, Jim!

04:53.042 --> 04:54.627
[yells]

04:54.711 --> 04:56.045
No, Master Jim!

04:57.797 --> 04:59.090
[roars]

04:59.173 --> 05:01.676
-[screams]
-Run!

05:02.260 --> 05:03.594
No! Jim!

05:03.678 --> 05:05.805
We have to go! He's buying us time!

05:05.930 --> 05:06.764
[Claire grunts]

05:06.889 --> 05:08.850
[Green Knight grunting]

05:12.061 --> 05:13.313
[roars]

05:14.772 --> 05:16.316
[whimpers]

05:16.399 --> 05:18.651
[Green Knight] Yield, beast.

05:18.776 --> 05:21.362
[grunts] Take him with us.

05:24.907 --> 05:28.494
Listen, everyone.
The world's ending... again.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.830
Go home. School's canceled anyway.

05:32.790 --> 05:33.833
[both gasp]

05:36.669 --> 05:38.379
[Steve] Oh, this was a bad place to hide.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.548
Ah! Oh, it smells!

05:40.631 --> 05:42.550
-Ow! [sputters, coughs]
-[liquid sloshes]

05:42.633 --> 05:46.512
Ah! The blue liquid! It's in my mouth!
It's in my mouth!

05:46.596 --> 05:50.183
[groaning, crying]

05:50.850 --> 05:52.226
There was nothing we could do!

05:52.310 --> 05:54.270
We'll go back for him, I promise.

05:54.353 --> 05:56.939
We can't. We must hide Nari.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.983
There's more at stake than you know.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.986
-The Trollhunter--
-Don't you talk to me about Jim!

06:02.070 --> 06:05.198
Oh, Master Jim! We are lost without him.

06:05.281 --> 06:08.826
We must seek refuge to regroup,
form a plan to save him.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.161
-Where?
-[Steve] Get me out of here!

06:10.244 --> 06:11.746
It's in my mouth!

06:12.413 --> 06:15.708
The Order has roamed this planet
for centuries.

06:15.792 --> 06:19.962
-[Steve screams, grunts]
-They know all my places of power.

06:20.046 --> 06:23.633
I know a place with plenty of power
where the Order's magic won't find us.

06:23.716 --> 06:26.219
[Steve] Pepper... Pepperjack? [groans]

06:26.302 --> 06:27.929
Where's Pepperjack?

06:29.097 --> 06:32.934
There you go.
Hex Tech appreciates your patronage.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.895
-[screen beeps]
-Serving number 66.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.021
Ay ay ay!

06:37.105 --> 06:39.899
How can I make your day magical, sir?

06:39.982 --> 06:42.944
I need spare parts for, uh... my dad.

06:43.111 --> 06:46.572
An apple a-a-a day
k-keeps the doctor away.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.574
What are you looking at?
It's my head, isn't it?

06:48.658 --> 06:51.577
[sighs] Not the weirdest thing
I've seen today.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.330
[nervous chuckle] Do you carry
transdimensional processors?

06:54.413 --> 06:56.457
Zoe! [chuckles]

06:56.541 --> 06:57.708
We need a place to lay low.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.169
Hisirdoux Casperan!

07:00.253 --> 07:01.754
You have a lot of nerve.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.422
Yes, like cutting in line.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.509
We were supposed to hunt niffins
and get burgers, remember?

07:06.592 --> 07:10.179
And you are supposed to help me
with my problem, remember?

07:10.263 --> 07:11.514
Toby! What are you doing here?

07:11.889 --> 07:15.143
Evil wizards shot down our time-traveling
castle and stole Monster Jimbo!

07:15.351 --> 07:17.895
Ugh. Come on, let's head to the back.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.272
-[door beeps]
-[Aaarrrgghh gasps]

07:19.355 --> 07:21.607
Whoa! Magic door!

07:21.691 --> 07:23.109
What are we doing here?

07:23.192 --> 07:25.820
We're not safe in this toy store.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.697
Yeesh! You brought your boss here?

07:27.780 --> 07:31.367
We're closed
to privileged Arthurian toolbags.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.829
-[Merlin chuckles] No.
-Come on, Krel. We're on a mission.

07:34.912 --> 07:37.206
Wait! Seems I missed a lot.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.708
[scoffs] Wait!

07:38.791 --> 07:40.793
What about my techie problem? Ah!

07:40.877 --> 07:44.213
[grumbles in German]

07:44.589 --> 07:47.049
Welcome to the real Hex Tech.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.052
Back here we charm
the mortals' electronics into shape

07:50.136 --> 07:53.598
and use the cash to fund
our own mystical pursuits.

07:53.681 --> 07:54.724
[gasps]

07:55.475 --> 07:59.145
Hex Tech is run entirely
by underground hedge wizards.

07:59.228 --> 08:02.607
Uh-huh. Did you try unplugging it
and plugging it back in?

08:02.690 --> 08:04.358
[man on phone] <i>Oh, yeah!</i>
<i>That did the trick!</i>

08:04.442 --> 08:06.444
Presto! Have a magical day.

08:06.527 --> 08:10.531
-[door beeps]
-[gasps] Dude, this place is sick!

08:10.615 --> 08:13.367
-Was that an antigravity ray?
-[both chuckling]

08:13.826 --> 08:15.286
You guys should be safe here.

08:15.536 --> 08:17.038
I have to go back.

08:17.121 --> 08:21.709
Do not break anything.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.879
Anything in here that can stop
some ancient evil wizards?

08:24.962 --> 08:26.672
It'll be nice to have a moment
to catch our breath.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.884
If the Order has their way,
we won't be breathing at all.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.720
Nari, tell them what we're up against.

08:32.803 --> 08:36.849
Since the beginning,
the Order has always sought to protect

08:36.933 --> 08:41.229
the balance of magic and mortal,
no matter the cost.

08:42.104 --> 08:45.566
-But our actions only brought pain.
-[people screaming]

08:45.650 --> 08:48.945
[Merlin] I've spent a millennium
keeping their horrors at bay.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.197
But it wasn't enough.

08:51.280 --> 08:56.577
Bellroc and Skrael believe
humanity is lost, beyond correction.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.831
Now they wish to end it all.

09:00.915 --> 09:04.794
-They search for the Genesis Seals.
-[Aaarrrgghh] Hmm! Huh.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.587
What are the Seals?

09:06.671 --> 09:08.839
Cute but deadly sea mammals, duh.

09:08.923 --> 09:12.510
[Douxie chuckles] You wish.
It's the oldest tale in the wizards books.

09:12.593 --> 09:15.972
Primal seals that contain
the very essence of magic.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.099
[Merlin] If the Seals are broken...

09:18.516 --> 09:23.437
then raw, uncontrolled magic
shall rise upon the world,

09:23.521 --> 09:25.773
wiping it like a flood.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.819
Come on! Destroying the world? Again?

09:29.902 --> 09:33.114
Ugh, can't these bad guys
just remodel a continent

09:33.197 --> 09:34.532
or do something nice for once?

09:34.782 --> 09:39.287
All of the Arcane Order must be present
to open the Seals.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.830
That is why I fled.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.582
I've hidden the Seals away,

09:42.665 --> 09:46.877
but we must keep Bellroc and Skrael
away from them and Nari,

09:46.961 --> 09:49.005
or it is the end of all things.

09:49.088 --> 09:52.258
But if they're after her,
why do they need Jim?

09:56.095 --> 09:57.096
[roars]

09:57.179 --> 09:59.682
[Green Knight] I've been hunting you,
beast.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.851
-You ran...
-[roars]

10:01.934 --> 10:04.645
...but my mark finally took you.

10:05.646 --> 10:08.858
You're nothing but Merlin's dog.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.527
[roars, whimpers]

10:11.694 --> 10:15.072
[Green Knight] The amulet--
it's only ever brought you pain.

10:15.239 --> 10:16.365
Give it to me.

10:18.242 --> 10:19.577
[roars]

10:20.453 --> 10:21.787
[whimpers]

10:22.580 --> 10:23.623
[Bellroc] The amulet--

10:24.248 --> 10:27.960
made from the last remaining piece of her.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.420
With it...

10:29.545 --> 10:32.632
We return her to this world.

10:32.715 --> 10:38.429
[both] <i>Tata Om Bekanze Maha Randza!</i>

10:39.597 --> 10:43.142
Thou who sleeps but yearns to slay,

10:43.225 --> 10:46.896
heed the call, rise up, obey.

10:47.313 --> 10:50.358
[Bellroc] Travel through the shadow door,

10:50.441 --> 10:54.487
assemble flesh and walk once more!

10:58.324 --> 11:00.701
[coughing]

11:02.078 --> 11:03.871
No! Please.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.748
My torment had ended.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.626
It was so quiet, so peaceful.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.503
[Bellroc] Recover your strength, Morgana.

11:10.586 --> 11:13.089
The Shadow Realm
has taken its toll on you.

11:13.172 --> 11:16.801
You never finished your purpose--
to make things right,

11:16.884 --> 11:18.719
to fix the balance.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.554
No more half-measures.

11:20.638 --> 11:23.265
Now we walk a new path
to remake the world.

11:23.349 --> 11:27.395
I already tried once,
and I lost everything.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.189
Please send me back. Why me?

11:30.272 --> 11:35.152
In truth, it was our Green Knight
who convinced us to return you.

11:35.319 --> 11:38.739
-Do you not recognize him?
-[gasps] What?

11:38.823 --> 11:42.618
[Green Knight] Now we finish
what we began together.

11:42.701 --> 11:45.996
We must search the source
of Master Jim's corruption.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.541
-Try "Rasputin Theurgy."
-Nothing.

11:48.624 --> 11:49.834
Let me see that.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.419
Curse you, auto-correct!

11:51.502 --> 11:55.297
I empathize, Miss Claire,
but we cannot go back to save him.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.800
Come on, this is our friend
we're talking about!

11:57.883 --> 11:59.176
Your Trollhunter!

11:59.260 --> 12:01.429
You want us to just forget about him?
No way!

12:01.512 --> 12:03.681
Surely there's something that we can do--

12:03.764 --> 12:06.183
[Merlin] The risk is too great
for a rescue!

12:06.267 --> 12:08.811
We must keep Nari safe from the Order.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.105
The fate of existence is at stake!

12:11.188 --> 12:13.107
This is why nobody likes you, dude!

12:13.190 --> 12:15.401
I care not for your "likes."

12:15.484 --> 12:17.903
James Lake is corrupted, gone!

12:17.987 --> 12:19.822
There is no bringing him back!

12:19.905 --> 12:21.949
Or you're just too stubborn to try!

12:22.032 --> 12:24.952
Please, you both have solid points.

12:25.035 --> 12:27.621
My presence causes such discord.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.832
I have put you all in danger.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.459
No worries, veggie lady.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.462
You are under the protection
of the Knights of Arcadia,

12:34.545 --> 12:35.796
which is only me, currently.

12:35.880 --> 12:39.508
I will not jeopardize
the mortal plane for one Troll!

12:39.592 --> 12:41.218
It's what he'd do for us.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.636
And look where that got him!

12:42.803 --> 12:44.180
-What?
-[energy surges]

12:44.263 --> 12:46.807
Come on, back me up, here! Anybody?

12:46.891 --> 12:48.392
-Archie?
-Don't look at me.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.270
Cats don't have the right to vote.
Neither do dragons.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.898
-Yet.
-Wait a tick.

12:53.981 --> 12:57.067
I know a way we can rescue Jim
without risking the world.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.819
-Is that so?
-How?

12:58.903 --> 13:02.323
And if it works, it will be
quite the little magic trick.

13:03.073 --> 13:07.036
[Merlin] I have concerns
about this cockamamy plan of yours.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.413
We're headed right into the lion's den.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.957
You gave me a staff
because you trusted me, right?

13:12.041 --> 13:13.918
-So, trust me.
-Very well.

13:14.001 --> 13:17.296
I stand by your decision... wizard.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.340
Everyone knows what they need to do.

13:19.423 --> 13:22.051
If we pull this off, we'll get Jim back.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.891
Arcane Order!

13:29.475 --> 13:30.851
We're here to barter!

13:35.523 --> 13:37.733
And that means "come in."

13:37.900 --> 13:41.153
Wait, we're flying
into the bitey devil castle?

13:45.282 --> 13:46.367
Ow!

13:50.246 --> 13:52.289
Uh, this is supes dumb.

13:52.373 --> 13:57.044
Like, even I know it's dumb,
and we're still gonna go inside?

14:03.884 --> 14:05.135
It's quiet, isn't it?

14:05.219 --> 14:07.012
Good evening, Skrael.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.224
Surrendering already?

14:10.307 --> 14:13.435
I was hoping for a little more
cat and mouse.

14:13.686 --> 14:18.148
You will be rewarded
with a quick and painful death.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.193
[Green Knight growling]

14:21.277 --> 14:24.655
A fight here will end poorly
for all of us.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.407
We seek a truce.

14:26.574 --> 14:27.658
[gasps, exhales]

14:30.578 --> 14:31.620
Go on, Hisirdoux.

14:31.704 --> 14:35.374
Good evening,
doers of evil and ancient terrors.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.626
We have a proposal: a trade.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.753
One of yours for one of ours.

14:39.837 --> 14:44.592
Our missing third in exchange
for your Troll mongrel?

14:44.675 --> 14:47.386
You would give up your only advantage?

14:47.469 --> 14:49.179
What does this gain you?

14:49.263 --> 14:52.016
Yes, well, an excellent question,

14:52.099 --> 14:58.355
one that requires a long, thoughtful,
time-consuming answer.

14:58.522 --> 14:59.773
Come on, Claire.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.233
[grunts]

15:01.859 --> 15:03.319
Where are you, Jim?

15:03.402 --> 15:04.236
-[growling]
-[gasps]

15:07.948 --> 15:09.241
[growls]

15:09.408 --> 15:14.163
And, finally, my friends and I returned
back to the present. [chuckles]

15:14.246 --> 15:16.790
-My, what a journey, eh, Nari?
-[sniffles]

15:16.874 --> 15:19.126
[sneezes, gasps]

15:19.209 --> 15:23.505
-[giggles]
-Nari, are you unwell?

15:23.631 --> 15:27.176
Uh, no, no, no, no, no.
Nari's just a bit jet-lagged is all!

15:27.259 --> 15:30.638
It's a human phrase
for, you know, traveling in jets

15:30.721 --> 15:32.556
and lagging a little.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.391
Pull it together, Nari.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.894
Jeez, what's taking her so long?

15:36.977 --> 15:38.729
I would have gotten Lake out by now!

15:38.812 --> 15:40.064
Come on, let's go!

15:41.023 --> 15:43.233
-We're getting you out of here.
-[growls]

15:43.317 --> 15:44.318
[Claire grunts]

15:49.448 --> 15:50.282
[sighs]

15:50.866 --> 15:52.660
Easy. Easy.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.411
This isn't you.

15:54.495 --> 15:58.499
-You're James Lake, Jr., the Trollhunter.
-[growls]

15:58.582 --> 16:00.209
Jim is gone.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.170
The Knight freed me. [roars]

16:03.253 --> 16:05.464
Nari's fine. Simple explanation.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.508
-Right, Nari?
-Oh, right.

16:07.591 --> 16:10.511
[coughs, gags]

16:11.553 --> 16:14.515
I guess the "me" is out of the bag.
[chuckles]

16:14.598 --> 16:16.058
Oh, fuzz buckets.

16:16.141 --> 16:19.061
-You dare deceive us?
-[grunts]

16:19.144 --> 16:21.981
Well, in all fairness,
I wasn't expecting a rogue hairball.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.608
Where is Nari? The real one!

16:24.692 --> 16:26.902
Eh, you're not the only one with magic.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.822
I am the Defying Duke Domzalski!

16:29.947 --> 16:32.491
-[laughs] Are you a god?
-[Toby humming]

16:33.742 --> 16:35.119
Yes. Yes, I am.

16:35.202 --> 16:37.746
-Don't tell anyone.
-[Aaarrrggh and Blinky groan]

16:37.830 --> 16:39.999
This castle shall be your tomb!

16:41.709 --> 16:43.460
Your ruse has failed!

16:43.544 --> 16:46.296
We must go now, to protect Nari!

16:46.380 --> 16:48.257
We're not leaving without Claire and Jim!

16:48.340 --> 16:50.092
Yes, we are! [grunts]

16:52.177 --> 16:53.762
-[Douxie grunts]
-Oh, dang! [whimpers]

16:53.846 --> 16:56.140
Do I dive in to save the day,
or do I go back to the ship?

16:56.223 --> 16:57.891
Can I fly it?
Will Wizard-Dad get mad if I do?

16:57.975 --> 17:00.561
Ah, dang! Palchuk Charge!

17:00.644 --> 17:03.731
-[yelling]
-[sighs]

17:05.274 --> 17:07.067
Annoying mortal.

17:07.735 --> 17:09.945
[screams, grunts]

17:10.154 --> 17:13.032
[Steve grunting, screams]

17:15.200 --> 17:16.869
-[chuckles]
-Please.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.955
You said we'd always find
a way to save each other.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.665
I love you.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.002
We belong together.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.881
[growls] I belong...

17:29.465 --> 17:30.674
here!

17:30.758 --> 17:32.468
-Jim! Come on!
-[growls]

17:32.551 --> 17:34.261
You're not making this easy!

17:34.344 --> 17:35.345
We'll help you.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.933
-[Claire grunts]
-[Morgana] The boy is gone, little lamb.

17:40.017 --> 17:40.976
[Claire] Morgana?

17:41.143 --> 17:42.853
You just won't die, will you?

17:43.020 --> 17:44.730
The Order had other plans.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.775
There's no way out, I'm afraid,
for any of us. [grunts]

17:51.570 --> 17:52.696
[Claire grunts]

17:53.280 --> 17:54.531
[Morgana grunts]

17:56.450 --> 17:57.493
[roars]

17:58.619 --> 18:00.662
I won't give up on you, Jim.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.081
I'll find a way.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.671
Foolish servant!

18:09.755 --> 18:11.840
You think you can stop us?

18:12.007 --> 18:16.011
We planned for a millennium--
gathering, waiting...

18:16.095 --> 18:19.264

18:21.391 --> 18:22.768
-[squeaks]
-[Skrael cackles]

18:22.851 --> 18:25.187
Do you mind?

18:25.270 --> 18:27.606
Sorry, it's just so fun.

18:27.689 --> 18:31.193
...to undo you, to undo all!

Your magicks are nothing! [grunts]

18:39.368 --> 18:40.536
[grunts]

18:43.872 --> 18:45.999
[grunts] Stay away from him!

18:57.636 --> 19:01.098
[Green Knight] You don't recognize me,
old friend?

19:01.306 --> 19:02.432
[gasps]

19:04.101 --> 19:06.019
Arthur! My king...

19:06.103 --> 19:07.771
How? Why?

19:07.855 --> 19:10.232
[Arthur] After I fell in battle,

19:10.315 --> 19:12.109
there was darkness.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.863
But they made me anew.

19:16.572 --> 19:17.489
No!

19:17.990 --> 19:19.700
-It cannot be!
-[growling]

-[grunts]
-[Steve screams, grunts]

19:27.833 --> 19:30.085
We propose new terms.

19:30.294 --> 19:33.255
Give us Nari, or he dies.

19:33.463 --> 19:34.423
-[Archie yowls]

19:35.799 --> 19:38.218
I'm sorry! This is my fault!

19:38.302 --> 19:42.890
I know not what darkness twists you,
but you will not harm the boy!

19:44.057 --> 19:47.060
Not while I draw breath!

what have you become?

20:05.621 --> 20:08.248

Hold still. I can fix this!

[hesitates] I can fix this!

21:04.429 --> 21:06.890
-I can--
-[Merlin] Stop, Hisirdoux.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.475
No one can.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.769
Do not blame yourself.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.188
I'm sorry. I should have listened to--

21:13.272 --> 21:14.439
No, no.

21:14.898 --> 21:16.191
I'm sorry.

21:17.109 --> 21:21.446
I spent a lifetime
serving the wrong master,

21:21.530 --> 21:23.865
trying to save this world.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.410
You can't!

21:26.493 --> 21:29.204
You're Merlin,
the greatest wizard of all time!

21:30.163 --> 21:30.998
[sobs]

21:31.081 --> 21:34.418
I saw a glimmer of greatness...

21:34.793 --> 21:36.670
of what you could become.

21:37.212 --> 21:42.259
And the greatest thing
I have ever accomplished was saving you.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.804
[exhales] I'll try and make you proud.

21:49.224 --> 21:50.851
You already have...

[exhales]

21:56.773 --> 21:57.691
No.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.694
No, you can't go!

22:02.571 --> 22:04.823
No, please. I'm not ready.

22:07.409 --> 22:08.243
Huh?

22:10.912 --> 22:13.832
Douxie, I'm so sorry.

22:14.916 --> 22:18.670
I-- I can't believe he's gone.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.306
What is that?

22:29.723 --> 22:31.600
It's all we have left to guide us.

22:32.225 --> 22:33.602
Other than that...

22:34.936 --> 22:36.313
we're on our own.
