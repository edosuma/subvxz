WEBVTT

00:32.031 --> 00:33.233
WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:33.233 --> 00:34.868
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:34.868 --> 00:37.270
I'M JOHN OLIVER, THANKS SO MUCH

00:37.270 --> 00:38.138
FOR JOINING US.

00:38.138 --> 00:39.873
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK!

00:39.873 --> 00:41.674
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CHARGED A

00:41.674 --> 00:42.175
21-YEAR-OLD WITH LEAKING

00:42.175 --> 00:42.876
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS, OUR

00:42.876 --> 00:43.810
BUSINESS DADDY TOOK ITS CONTENT

00:43.810 --> 00:45.545
PURGE UP A NOTCH AND JUST THREW

00:45.545 --> 00:48.982
THE WHOLE HBO OUT.

00:48.982 --> 00:51.217
AND THE NRA HELD ITS ANNUAL

00:51.217 --> 00:52.452
CONVENTION, AT WHICH SOUTH

00:52.452 --> 00:54.187
DAKOTA GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM

00:54.187 --> 00:54.621
TRIED DESPERATELY TO

00:54.621 --> 00:55.622
DISPEL STEREOTYPES ABOUT THE

00:55.622 --> 00:56.523
GROUP, ONLY TO BE UNDERCUT BY A

00:56.523 --> 00:57.991
BRUTAL CUTAWAY.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.426
THE MEDIA WOULD HAVE

00:59.426 --> 01:00.860
US BELIEVE THAT THE NRA IS ONLY

01:00.860 --> 01:02.028
MADE UP OF OLD WHITE GUYS.

01:02.028 --> 01:05.932
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER

01:05.932 --> 01:06.466
PEOPLE, A LOT OF DIVERSITY

01:06.466 --> 01:07.967
WITHIN THE NRA.

01:07.967 --> 01:11.538
WELL, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,

01:11.538 --> 01:12.305
I MAY BE A MOM AND A GRANDMA,

01:12.305 --> 01:17.410
BUT I AM THE NRA.

01:17.677 --> 01:20.180
THAT'S AN OSCAR-WINNING

01:20.180 --> 01:21.347
EDIT RIGHT THERE.

01:21.347 --> 01:22.348
NOTHING UNDERMINES HER POINT

01:22.348 --> 01:23.416
BETTER THAN A CUTAWAY PROVING

01:23.416 --> 01:24.884
THE DIVERSITY IN THAT CROWD

01:24.884 --> 01:26.653
RANGE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

01:26.653 --> 01:28.021
"ANTIQUES ROADSHOW" AND "FRIENDS

01:28.021 --> 01:29.422
REUNION".

01:29.422 --> 01:30.423
THAT LOOKS LIKE A VERSION OF

01:30.423 --> 01:31.591
"GUESS WHO" THAT'S JUST "OOPS

01:31.591 --> 01:33.126
ALL PETER".

01:33.126 --> 01:34.594
BUT INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THAT,

01:34.594 --> 01:35.795
TONIGHT, LIKE EVERY FIGHT YOU'VE

01:35.795 --> 01:38.665
HAD WITH YOUR UNCLE SINCE 2016,

01:38.665 --> 01:39.299
WE'RE GOING TO START WITH

01:39.299 --> 01:40.500
ABORTION.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.601
THE THING REPUBLICAN MEN LOVE TO

01:41.601 --> 01:43.002
BAN ALMOST AS MUCH AS THEY LOVE

01:43.002 --> 01:44.871
TO SECRETLY PAY FOR.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.606
JUST OVER A WEEK AGO, A TEXAS

01:46.606 --> 01:48.541
JUDGE SUSPENDED THE FDA'S

01:48.541 --> 01:49.776
APPROVAL OF MIFEPRISTONE, A KEY

01:49.776 --> 01:50.343
COMPONENT IN MEDICATION

01:50.343 --> 01:51.644
ABORTIONS.

01:51.644 --> 01:53.413
AND AS MANY QUICKLY POINTED OUT,

01:53.413 --> 01:55.381
THE RULING WAS SHAKY AT BEST.

01:55.381 --> 01:57.283
THE CONSERVATIVE TEXAS JUDGE

01:57.283 --> 01:58.885
BEHIND THE RULING TO BAN THE

01:58.885 --> 02:01.588
DRUG ARGUES THAT THE FDA

02:01.588 --> 02:03.256
IMPROPERLY APPROVED IT 23 YEARS

02:03.256 --> 02:06.392
AGO, IGNORING

02:06.392 --> 02:07.894
LEGITIMATE SAFETY CONCERNS.

02:07.894 --> 02:08.661
BUT AT THE TIME, THE FDA

02:08.661 --> 02:10.597
ACTUALLY SPENT TRIPLE THE

02:10.597 --> 02:11.898
AVERAGE AMOUNT OF TIME STUDYING

02:11.898 --> 02:12.899
THE DRUG.

02:12.899 --> 02:16.102
YEP.

02:16.102 --> 02:16.870
THE JUDGE IN QUESTION,

02:16.870 --> 02:17.537
MATTHEW KACSMARYK, ARGUED THAT A

02:17.537 --> 02:19.072
DRUG THAT'S BEEN ON THE MARKET

02:19.072 --> 02:20.173
IN THE U.S. FOR 23 YEARS, IS

02:20.173 --> 02:20.874
SOMEHOW TOO DANGEROUS.

02:20.874 --> 02:21.875
WHICH IS WILD, GIVEN THAT IT'S

02:21.875 --> 02:23.776
BEEN WIDELY AVAILABLE FOR A FULL

02:23.776 --> 02:25.879
KIERNAN SHIPKA NOW.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.180
AND IT'S NOT JUST THE FACT THAT

02:27.180 --> 02:29.015
MIFEPRISTONE WAS STUDIED FOR

02:29.015 --> 02:32.485
TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE

02:32.485 --> 02:33.653
FDA NORMALLY WOULD, IT'S THAT

02:33.653 --> 02:34.654
IT'S DEMONSTRABLY SAFER THAN

02:34.654 --> 02:39.526
MANY OTHERS ON THE MARKET.

02:39.526 --> 02:42.161
AND ANALYSIS FOUND THE RISK

02:42.161 --> 02:43.363
OF DIRECT FROM ANOTHER DRUG

02:43.363 --> 02:44.931
PENICILLIN IS FOUR TIMES GREATER

02:44.931 --> 02:47.133
THAN IT IS FOR THIS ABORTION

02:47.133 --> 02:47.800
MEDICATION.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.003
THE RISK IN DEATH AFTER TAKING

02:50.003 --> 02:51.771
OTHER DRUG IS TEN TIMES GREATER

02:51.771 --> 02:53.206
AS WELL.

02:53.206 --> 02:53.840
RIGHT, ONCE IT'S CLEAR

02:53.840 --> 02:54.474
THAT SOMETHING'S SAFER THAN BOTH

02:54.474 --> 02:55.241
TREATING STREP THROAT AND GIVING

02:55.241 --> 02:59.312
AN OLD GUY A BONER, IT'S PRETTY

02:59.312 --> 02:59.913
HARD TO PULL THE PUBLIC HEALTH

02:59.913 --> 03:01.014
CARD.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.949
AND LOOK, IT'S NOT THAT

03:02.949 --> 03:03.483
SURPRISING THAT THIS JUDGE

03:03.483 --> 03:04.017
ARRIVED AT A CONCLUSION

03:04.017 --> 03:04.684
NOT SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE.

03:04.684 --> 03:05.852
NOT ONLY DOES HE HAVE A FACE

03:05.852 --> 03:06.286
THAT

03:06.286 --> 03:07.887
SCREAMS "HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL

03:07.887 --> 03:09.155
COACH WHO FOLLOWS ALL THE

03:09.155 --> 03:10.957
CHEERLEADERS ON INSTAGRAM", BUT

03:10.957 --> 03:12.892
PRIOR TO BEING APPOINTED TO THE

03:12.892 --> 03:13.593
COURT BY TRUMP, HE WAS LOUDLY

03:13.593 --> 03:16.696
ANTI-ABORTION AND PART

03:16.696 --> 03:17.163
OF A RIGHT-WING LEGAL

03:17.163 --> 03:17.830
ORGANIZATION.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.032
EVEN HIS CONFIRMATION HEARING

03:19.032 --> 03:19.899
FEATURED SOME PRETTY BIG RED

03:19.899 --> 03:23.403
FLAGS.

03:23.403 --> 03:27.006
YOU SAID IN 2015 THAT

03:27.006 --> 03:29.509
RECOGNIZING THE RIGHT TO SAME

03:29.509 --> 03:33.580
SEX MARRIAGE WOULD LEAD THIS

03:33.580 --> 03:35.648
COUNTRY ON QUOTE, "A ROAD TO

03:35.648 --> 03:38.418
POTENTIAL TYRANNY."

03:38.418 --> 03:41.554
DO YOU CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT?

03:41.554 --> 03:43.323
SENATOR, I AM, UH, I DON'T

03:43.323 --> 03:44.891
HAVE ANY RECOLLECTION OF THAT

03:44.891 --> 03:46.526
QUOTE.

03:46.526 --> 03:49.162
IT WAS IN AN AMICUS BRIEF

03:49.162 --> 03:49.562
THAT YOU WROTE IN

03:49.562 --> 03:51.664
OBERGEFELD V HODGES.

03:51.664 --> 03:52.498
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT

03:52.498 --> 03:54.267
PARTICULAR QUOTE.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.502
OH, YOU DON'T, DO YOU?

03:56.502 --> 03:58.438
IT'S PRETTY TELLING THAT INSTEAD

03:58.438 --> 03:59.606
OF AN OUTRIGHT "NO," HE SAID "I

03:59.606 --> 04:00.106
DON'T REMEMBER."

04:00.106 --> 04:01.307
INDICATING HE KNOWS IT'S

04:01.307 --> 04:02.742
SOMETHING THAT HE COULD'VE SAID.

04:02.742 --> 04:03.810
I DON'T REMEMBER EVERYTHING I'VE

04:03.810 --> 04:05.712
EVER SAID, BUT I CERTAINLY KNOW

04:05.712 --> 04:07.347
WHAT SOUNDS LIKE ME.

04:07.347 --> 04:08.514
HAVE I EVER SAID "YA GOTTA GIVE

04:08.514 --> 04:08.915
IT TO THE NAZIS?"

04:08.915 --> 04:10.650
NO, I HAVEN'T.

04:10.650 --> 04:11.884
HAVE I EVER SAID, "WHERE THE

04:11.884 --> 04:13.219
SKANKS AT, JOHNNY O WANTS TO GET

04:13.219 --> 04:13.753
HIS DICK WET"

04:13.753 --> 04:14.821
NO, I HAVEN'T.

04:14.821 --> 04:16.823
HAVE I EVER SAID, "THE GIRL ONE

04:16.823 --> 04:18.591
FROM GREMLINS 2 COULD

04:18.591 --> 04:19.125
GET IT?"

04:19.125 --> 04:19.659
SENATOR I DON'T HAVE ANY

04:19.659 --> 04:21.594
RECOLLECTION OF THAT PARTICULAR

04:21.594 --> 04:23.796
QUOTE.

04:23.796 --> 04:25.198
SO WE ALWAYS KNEW WHERE

04:25.198 --> 04:25.965
KACSMARYK WOULD GO ON AN

04:25.965 --> 04:26.766
ABORTION CASE.

04:26.766 --> 04:27.767
BUT THE WAY HE GOT THERE WAS

04:27.767 --> 04:29.836
STILL SHOCKINGLY DISHONEST.

04:29.836 --> 04:31.571
AT ONE POINT, HIS RULING CITES A

04:31.571 --> 04:33.306
STATISTIC THAT 77% OF WOMEN WHO

04:33.306 --> 04:35.441
HAD A "CHEMICAL ABORTION"

04:35.441 --> 04:36.876
REPORTED A NEGATIVE CHANGE AS A

04:36.876 --> 04:38.478
RESULT.

04:38.478 --> 04:39.579
BUT THE SAMPLE FOR THAT STUDY

04:39.579 --> 04:41.648
WAS BASED ON 98 BLOG POSTS ON AN

04:41.648 --> 04:42.949
ANTI-ABORTION WEBSITE.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.085
EVEN THE STUDY ITSELF POINTED

04:46.085 --> 04:47.620
OUT HOW NON-REPRESENTATIVE IT

04:47.620 --> 04:49.822
WAS, SAYING, "MOST WOMEN

04:49.822 --> 04:50.423
REPORTED THAT THEIR MEDICATION

04:50.423 --> 04:51.924
ABORTION CHANGED THEM, WHICH IS

04:51.924 --> 04:55.828
NOT SURPRISING GIVEN THE

04:55.828 --> 04:57.397
NAME OF THE WEBSITE "ABORTION

04:57.397 --> 04:59.198
CHANGES YOU."

04:59.198 --> 05:00.166
AND THAT'S SOME HEAVY

05:00.166 --> 05:00.566
CONFIRMATION BIAS.

05:00.566 --> 05:01.167
THIS IS THAT SITE!

05:01.167 --> 05:02.168
AND USING THAT AS YOUR SOURCE IS

05:02.168 --> 05:03.603
LIKE CLAIMING THAT ABORTION

05:03.603 --> 05:05.071
MAKES YOU BETTER AT FRISBEE

05:05.071 --> 05:06.439
GOLF, BY CITING A POLL ON THE

05:06.439 --> 05:08.141
WEBSITE, "ABORTION MAKES YOU

05:08.141 --> 05:11.310
BETTER AT FRISBEE GOLF DOT COM."

05:11.310 --> 05:12.345
BY THE WAY, FUN FACT, WHENEVER

05:12.345 --> 05:13.413
WE MENTION A FAKE WEBSITE ON

05:13.413 --> 05:15.948
THIS SHOW, WE HAVE TO BUY THE

05:15.948 --> 05:17.817
ACTUAL URL TO MAKE SURE NO ONE

05:17.817 --> 05:19.385
TAKES IT.

05:19.385 --> 05:19.919
SO, WE NOW OWN THE DOMAIN

05:19.919 --> 05:20.853
"ABORTION MAKES YOU BETTER AT

05:20.853 --> 05:23.256
FRISBEE GOLF DOT COM."

05:23.256 --> 05:24.590
WHICH IS CURRENTLY JUST A PAGE

05:24.590 --> 05:25.658
WITH THE WORDS, "WHY ARE YOU

05:25.658 --> 05:28.761
HERE?"

05:28.761 --> 05:29.996
ALSO, ONE MORE THOUGHT ON

05:29.996 --> 05:34.200
"ABORTION CHANGES YOU".

05:34.200 --> 05:35.168
NOT TO BE CRASS, BUT YOU KNOW

05:35.168 --> 05:36.135
WHAT ELSE DOES THAT?

05:36.135 --> 05:36.803
A FUCKING PREGNANCY.

05:36.803 --> 05:37.804
BECAUSE I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU,

05:37.804 --> 05:38.771
FOR WEEKS AFTER GIVING BIRTH,

05:38.771 --> 05:39.906
THAT BABY'S NOT THE ONLY ONE IN

05:39.906 --> 05:41.340
DIAPERS.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.509
ALSO THERE'S A BABY NOW.

05:43.509 --> 05:44.610
AND LOOK, ENDING ACCESS TO

05:44.610 --> 05:46.479
MIFEPRISTONE WON'T, IN ITSELF,

05:46.479 --> 05:47.346
END MEDICATION ABORTIONS

05:47.346 --> 05:51.951
ENTIRELY.

05:51.951 --> 05:52.585
IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO IT WITHOUT

05:52.585 --> 05:53.419
MIFEPRISTONE, BUT IT CAN BE MORE

05:53.419 --> 05:54.454
DIFFICULT AND MORE PAINFUL.

05:54.454 --> 05:55.755
ALSO, MIFEPRISTONE ISN'T JUST

05:55.755 --> 05:56.823
USED FOR ABORTIONS.

05:56.823 --> 05:58.057
IT'S A CRITICAL TOOL FOR

05:58.057 --> 05:59.692
TREATING MISCARRIAGES.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.360
SO, LIKE MOST ANTI-ABORTION

06:01.360 --> 06:02.662
MEASURES, THIS RULING COULD ALSO

06:02.662 --> 06:04.063
END UP SEVERELY IMPACTING THOSE

06:04.063 --> 06:05.898
WITH MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS FROM

06:05.898 --> 06:07.233
WANTED PREGNANCIES AS WELL.

06:07.233 --> 06:08.868
AS THIS DOCTOR POINTS OUT,

06:08.868 --> 06:11.003
ANYONE HAVING A MISCARRIAGE WHO

06:11.003 --> 06:13.506
CAN'T ACCESS A MEDICATION

06:13.506 --> 06:14.907
ABORTION MAY BE SUBJECT TO SOME

06:14.907 --> 06:17.176
INTENSE SUFFERING.

06:17.176 --> 06:20.446
"THEY'LL HAVE TO EITHER HAVE

06:20.446 --> 06:21.147
SURGERY, OR THEY'LL HAVE TO

06:21.147 --> 06:22.181
WAIT, WHICH, YOU KNOW, WAIT FOR

06:22.181 --> 06:23.850
THE PREGNANCY TO PASS ON ITS OWN

06:23.850 --> 06:24.684
WHICH COULD TAKE EIGHT WEEKS.

06:24.684 --> 06:25.785
AND THAT'S BRUTAL AND

06:25.785 --> 06:27.019
THAT'S, I MEAN, TORTURE FOR

06:27.019 --> 06:27.620
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING THROUGH A

06:27.620 --> 06:30.757
MISCARRIAGE.

06:30.757 --> 06:31.324
EXACTLY, CAN YOU

06:31.324 --> 06:32.492
IMAGINE GETTING SOME

06:32.492 --> 06:33.726
OF THE WORST NEWS OF YOUR LIFE

06:33.726 --> 06:34.527
AND THEN HAVING TO CARRY IT

06:34.527 --> 06:36.462
AROUND PAINFULLY WITH YOU FOR

06:36.462 --> 06:41.734
EIGHT WEEKS, ALL BECAUSE SOME

06:41.734 --> 06:42.869
DISNEY CHANNEL VICE PRINCIPAL

06:42.869 --> 06:43.836
FROM TEXAS DECIDED TO PLAY

06:43.836 --> 06:44.470
DOCTOR FOR THE ENTIRE FUCKING

06:44.470 --> 06:45.238
COUNTRY?

06:45.238 --> 06:46.239
NOW, THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN A

06:46.239 --> 06:46.939
LOT OF APPEALS, AND THE SUPREME

06:46.939 --> 06:47.473
COURT JUST STEPPED IN, AND

06:47.473 --> 06:48.808
PUT KACSMARYK'S ORDER ON HOLD

06:48.808 --> 06:49.342
UNTIL AT LEAST THIS COMING

06:49.342 --> 06:49.609
WEDNESDAY.

06:49.609 --> 06:50.243
SO THERE'S A LOT UP IN THE AIR

06:50.243 --> 06:51.010
HERE.

06:51.010 --> 06:54.380
BUT IT'S NOT IDEAL THAT THE

06:54.380 --> 06:55.815
DREAM TEAM WHO OVERTURNED

06:55.815 --> 06:56.983
ROE V. WADE MAY SOON DECIDE

06:56.983 --> 06:57.784
WHETHER TO GREENLIGHT

06:57.784 --> 06:58.317
THE SEQUEL.

06:58.317 --> 06:59.819
BECAUSE OVERTURNING ROE WAS

06:59.819 --> 07:00.353
CLEARLY

07:00.353 --> 07:01.187
NEVER ABOUT "RETURNING IT TO THE

07:01.187 --> 07:02.989
STATES."

07:02.989 --> 07:04.357
IT WAS ALWAYS A STEP TOWARDS

07:04.357 --> 07:06.959
BANNING ABORTION ENTIRELY.

07:06.959 --> 07:08.227
AND IT'S FRANKLY BOTH ABSURD AND

07:08.227 --> 07:09.662
INFURIATING THAT SUCH VITAL

07:09.662 --> 07:10.797
HEALTHCARE CAN BE THROWN INTO

07:10.797 --> 07:12.265
CHAOS FOR EVERYONE, ALL BECAUSE

07:12.265 --> 07:14.433
OF THE BADLY-REASONED DECISIONS

07:14.433 --> 07:16.068
OF THIS FUCKING GUY.

07:16.068 --> 07:17.570
IT SEEMS LIKE ABORTION HAS

07:17.570 --> 07:19.839
BECOME A SCHRODINGER'S RIGHT IN

07:19.839 --> 07:21.507
THIS COUNTRY THAT PEOPLE

07:21.507 --> 07:22.642
SIMULTANEOUSLY DO AND DON'T

07:22.642 --> 07:23.943
HAVE, DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY

07:23.943 --> 07:25.178
LIVE, WHO'S IN THE WHITE HOUSE,

07:25.178 --> 07:26.579
AND WHAT THE SHITTIEST JUDGE IN

07:26.579 --> 07:27.947
AMERICA FEELS LIKE DOING.

07:27.947 --> 07:31.584
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR

07:31.584 --> 07:33.119
IT TO BE PROTECTED BY LAW--

07:33.119 --> 07:35.521
IDEALLY IN THE CONSTITUTION--

07:35.521 --> 07:37.256
AND FOR IT TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR

07:37.256 --> 07:39.926
A BASIC RIGHT, A HUMAN

07:39.926 --> 07:41.427
NECESSITY AND SOMETHING THAT I

07:41.427 --> 07:43.396
HEAR-- AND I GOT THIS FROM A

07:43.396 --> 07:44.163
COMPLETELY REPUTABLE WEBSITE--

07:44.163 --> 07:45.865
COULD ACTUALLY MAKE YOU BETTER

07:45.865 --> 07:50.736
AT FRISBEE GOLF.

07:50.736 --> 07:53.539
AND NOW THIS.

07:53.539 --> 07:56.175
AND NOW, DID YOU

07:56.175 --> 07:58.778
KNOW ACTION NEWS' ROBERT

07:58.778 --> 07:59.312
GRANT HAS A FUCKING DAIRY

07:59.312 --> 07:59.545
ALLERGY?

07:59.545 --> 08:00.413
I'VE NEVER HAD NUTELLA.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.148
I HAVE A FUN FACT, TOO!

08:02.148 --> 08:02.748
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO

08:02.748 --> 08:04.150
SAY.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.818
I CAN'T HAVE NUTELLA BECAUSE

08:05.818 --> 08:11.991
I HAVE A DAIRY ALLERGY.

08:11.991 --> 08:12.992
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME

08:12.992 --> 08:13.492
LIKE THAT?

08:13.492 --> 08:14.060
YOU HAVE TO BRING UP THE

08:14.060 --> 08:15.328
DAIRY THING?

08:15.328 --> 08:16.729
WE KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE.

08:16.729 --> 08:18.264
WE RECOGNIZE THE ORGANIZATION

08:18.264 --> 08:22.101
THAT GAVE US HOW YOU SAY THIS?

08:22.101 --> 08:25.905
TAGALOG?

08:25.905 --> 08:26.472
I HAVE A DAIRY ALLERGY, SO I

08:26.472 --> 08:30.409
DON'T KNOW.

08:30.409 --> 08:33.045
ROBERT, CAN YOU EAT SNICKERS?

08:33.045 --> 08:33.579
YOU KNOW I CAN'T EAT--

08:33.579 --> 08:34.146
YOU HAVE A DAIRY ALLERGY.

08:34.146 --> 08:42.088
I DON'T MEAN TO OVER SHARE,

08:42.088 --> 08:42.588
BUT I AM ALLERGIC DAIRY.

08:42.588 --> 08:43.222
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU CAN'T EAT

08:43.222 --> 08:43.389
IT.

08:43.389 --> 08:43.823
I CAN'T EAT IT.

08:43.823 --> 08:44.423
THE DAIRY ALLERGY ALWAYS GETS

08:44.423 --> 08:44.590
ME.

08:44.590 --> 08:45.124
THE HOT CUP OF COFFEE.

08:45.124 --> 08:46.058
THE HOT CHOCOLATE'S NOT FOR YOU,

08:46.058 --> 08:46.792
THOUGH, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HAVE

08:46.792 --> 08:47.827
DAIRY.

08:47.827 --> 08:50.129
WHY, MEGAN?

08:50.129 --> 08:51.697
I LIKE POPCORN WITH A BUNCH

08:51.697 --> 08:52.531
OF CRUNCH ON TOP.

08:52.531 --> 08:54.267
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CRUNCH IS.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.801
IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE DAIRY

08:55.801 --> 08:56.369
IN IT AND YOU CAN'T EAT IT.

08:56.369 --> 08:56.969
SORRY, ROBERT.

08:56.969 --> 08:59.805
YOU CANNOT PARTAKE IN THAT.

08:59.805 --> 09:00.606
DAIRY ALLERGY IF YOU DIDN'T

09:00.606 --> 09:03.709
KNOW.

09:03.709 --> 09:04.277
ROBERT CAN'T HAVE IT BECAUSE

09:04.277 --> 09:04.844
DAIRY.

09:04.844 --> 09:05.478
THE CHOCO TACO MAY BE THE

09:05.478 --> 09:05.945
RETURN.

09:05.945 --> 09:07.914
ROBERT CALLS IT THE CHOKE-O TACO

09:07.914 --> 09:12.685
SO YOU KNOW WHO EATS ICE CREAM

09:12.685 --> 09:13.286
IN THIS STUDIO.

09:13.286 --> 09:16.088
I HAVE DAIRY ALLERGIES.

09:16.589 --> 09:17.356
MOVING ON.

09:17.356 --> 09:17.990
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

09:17.990 --> 09:18.557
FARMING.

09:18.557 --> 09:19.992
FARMS ARE WHERE WE GET OUR FOOD,

09:19.992 --> 09:21.560
OUR METAPHORS ABOUT FASCISM, AND

09:21.560 --> 09:23.029
THEY'RE EVEN THE SUBJECT OF

09:23.029 --> 09:24.030
SURPRISINGLY POPULAR VIDEO GAMES

09:24.030 --> 09:25.464
LIKE THIS.

09:25.464 --> 09:25.898
I PLAYED FARMING

09:25.898 --> 09:27.934
SIMULATOR.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.068
A WHOLE NEW WORLD WAS REVEALED

09:29.068 --> 09:29.936
TO ME.

09:29.936 --> 09:33.272
AGRICULTURE.

09:33.272 --> 09:34.674
ANIMAL HUSBANDRY.

09:34.674 --> 09:36.509
FORESTRY.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.844
AND A LOT OF EXCITING MACHINERY.

09:38.844 --> 09:42.515
NEVER CULTIVATED A FIELD BEFORE.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.250
AND, OH BOY, LET ME TELL YOU

09:44.250 --> 09:45.785
ABOUT SPRAYING A FIELD WITH A

09:45.785 --> 09:46.786
DOUBLE APPLICATION RATE, AND

09:46.786 --> 09:47.987
DYNAMIC WORKING WIDTH.

09:47.987 --> 09:49.655
THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE!

09:49.655 --> 09:50.523
BELIEVE ME, FARMING IS

09:50.523 --> 09:52.825
EASY.

09:52.825 --> 09:54.694
MASTERING IT IS A CHALLENGE.

09:54.694 --> 09:55.227
AND THERE'S ALWAYS TIME TO

09:55.227 --> 09:57.830
RELAX.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.566
I HAVE GREAT NEWS FOR

10:00.566 --> 10:05.071
THAT GUY WHO'S "NEVER CULTIVATED

10:05.071 --> 10:05.438
A FIELD BEFORE".

10:05.438 --> 10:05.972
YOU STILL HAVEN'T.

10:05.972 --> 10:07.073
YOU HAVEN'T GROWN A VEGETABLE,

10:07.073 --> 10:08.240
YOU HAVEN'T SPRAYED ANYTHING

10:08.240 --> 10:08.874
WITH A DOUBLE RATE OF ANYTHING,

10:08.874 --> 10:09.775
AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN

10:09.775 --> 10:10.910
REALLY WATCHED ANY BARNYARD

10:10.910 --> 10:11.544
ANIMALS GO TO POUND-TOWN.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.680
THAT GAME IS TO FARMING WHAT

10:14.680 --> 10:17.817
CALL OF DUTY IS TO WAR.

10:17.817 --> 10:18.818
IT LOOKS SIMILAR, BUT IF YOU

10:18.818 --> 10:19.785
WERE EVER CALLED ON TO DO THE

10:19.785 --> 10:20.486
REAL THING, YOU'D BE

10:20.486 --> 10:20.987
CATEGORICALLY FUCKED.

10:20.987 --> 10:22.154
NOW, THAT FARMER LOOKS PRETTY

10:22.154 --> 10:23.189
MUCH LIKE THE STEREOTYPICAL ONE

10:23.189 --> 10:24.623
IN MOST PEOPLE'S MINDS-- A

10:24.623 --> 10:25.257
WHITE GUY IN OVERALLS ON A

10:25.257 --> 10:28.327
TRACTOR.

10:28.327 --> 10:28.961
IT'S A TROPE DRAWN STRAIGHT FROM

10:28.961 --> 10:29.862
CHILDREN'S PICTURE BOOKS, WHERE

10:29.862 --> 10:30.930
FARMERS ALWAYS SEEM TO BE A

10:30.930 --> 10:32.098
WHITE MAN WITH SOME STRAW IN HIS

10:32.098 --> 10:33.265
MOUTH WHO'S HOLDING AN ADORABLE

10:33.265 --> 10:34.533
LITTLE PIGLET THAT, WHILE THE

10:34.533 --> 10:35.701
BOOK SKIPS OVER IT, HE DOES

10:35.701 --> 10:37.236
EVENTUALLY KILL AND EAT.

10:37.236 --> 10:38.571
BUT WHILE SOME FARMERS DO INDEED

10:38.571 --> 10:39.805
LOOK LIKE THAT, MANY OF THE

10:39.805 --> 10:42.141
PEOPLE DOING SOME OF THE HARDEST

10:42.141 --> 10:43.642
WORK ON FARMS-- HIRED FARM

10:43.642 --> 10:45.144
LABORERS-- DO NOT.

10:45.144 --> 10:48.014
THERE ARE ROUGHLY ONE AND A HALF

10:48.014 --> 10:49.849
MILLION HIRED FARMWORKERS IN THE

10:49.849 --> 10:50.649
U.S., MOSTLY CROP

10:50.649 --> 10:51.250
WORKERS.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.251
AND GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES

10:52.251 --> 10:52.885
INDICATE THAT MOST OF THOSE ARE

10:52.885 --> 10:53.652
FOREIGN-BORN.

10:53.652 --> 10:54.286
AND AMONG THEM, THE MAJORITY ARE

10:54.286 --> 10:56.288
UNDOCUMENTED.

10:56.288 --> 11:00.860
AND THIS HAS BEEN AN OPEN SECRET

11:00.860 --> 11:02.094
FOR YEARS NOW.

11:02.094 --> 11:03.262
JUST WATCH THIS INTERVIEW WITH A

11:03.262 --> 11:03.863
FARM OWNER FROM 2009, QUICKLY

11:03.863 --> 11:04.530
TAKE A TURN.

11:04.530 --> 11:05.197
HOW MANY GUYS DO YOU EMPLOY?'

11:05.197 --> 11:05.664
I HAVE 22 FULL-TIME

11:05.664 --> 11:07.566
EMPLOYEES.

11:07.566 --> 11:09.402
ARE MOST OF THEM LATINO GUYS

11:09.402 --> 11:11.370
OR THEY--

11:11.370 --> 11:12.972
100%.

11:12.972 --> 11:13.873
THESE GUYS CITIZENS?

11:13.873 --> 11:15.474
RESIDENTS?

11:15.474 --> 11:17.510
THEY ALL ARE LEGAL.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.945
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

11:19.945 --> 11:23.849
CUT THE CAMERA.

11:23.849 --> 11:24.450
WE TALKED OFF-CAMERA AND A

11:24.450 --> 11:25.284
FEW MINUTES LATER, MYERS ALLOWED

11:25.284 --> 11:26.385
US TO RESUME THE INTERVIEW.

11:26.385 --> 11:27.853
THE LEGAL DOCUMENTATION THAT

11:27.853 --> 11:29.155
THEY PRESENTED TO ME

11:29.155 --> 11:34.226
IS-- THEY ARE LEGAL.

11:34.226 --> 11:34.860
OH, THEY ARE, ARE THEY?

11:34.860 --> 11:35.428
I'VE GOTTA SAY, THAT'S NOT A

11:35.428 --> 11:36.028
PARTICULARLY CONVINCING BIT OF

11:36.028 --> 11:36.362
MISDIRECTION.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.296
COVER-WISE, THAT'S ABOUT AS

11:37.296 --> 11:39.265
EFFECTIVE AS A CAMOUFLAGE OUTFIT

11:39.265 --> 11:39.865
THAT JUST SAYS "NOT A GUY" ON

11:39.865 --> 11:41.000
IT.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.568
THE TRUTH IS, FARMS DEPEND

11:42.568 --> 11:44.270
HEAVILY ON FOREIGN-BORN WORKERS

11:44.270 --> 11:45.871
TO DO HARVESTING AND PICKING, AS

11:45.871 --> 11:46.772
MANY CROPS ARE TOO DELICATE TO

11:46.772 --> 11:48.074
BE MECHANIZED.

11:48.074 --> 11:49.942
THAT'S WHY MOST FRUITS AND

11:49.942 --> 11:51.077
VEGETABLES ARE STILL HARVESTED

11:51.077 --> 11:52.611
BY HAND.

11:52.611 --> 11:54.246
AND BY AND LARGE, AMERICAN

11:54.246 --> 11:55.381
CITIZENS HAVE SHOWN VERY LITTLE

11:55.381 --> 11:56.682
INTEREST IN DOING THAT.

11:56.682 --> 11:59.018
IN FACT, WHEN WASHINGTON STATE

11:59.018 --> 11:59.919
SPENT THOUSANDS ON AN

11:59.919 --> 12:01.587
ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN TO FIND

12:01.587 --> 12:03.222
U.S. FARMWORKERS IN 2021, IT

12:03.222 --> 12:05.591
RESULTED IN ONE JOB REFERRAL AND

12:05.591 --> 12:07.626
ZERO HIRES.

12:07.626 --> 12:08.561
BUT OVER THE PAST DECADE AND A

12:08.561 --> 12:09.895
HALF, CHANGES IN IMMIGRATION

12:09.895 --> 12:12.131
POLICY

12:12.131 --> 12:13.165
AND ENFORCEMENT HAVE MADE IT

12:13.165 --> 12:14.200
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR FARMERS

12:14.200 --> 12:15.201
TO FIND WORKERS-- FORCING SOME

12:15.201 --> 12:17.036
EXTREME CHOICES.

12:17.036 --> 12:19.138
6,000 PEOPLE SHOWED UP ON A

12:19.138 --> 12:20.239
SATURDAY FOR THE CHANCE

12:20.239 --> 12:22.708
TO PICK SOME FREE VEGGIES.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.844
THE FARMER WHOSE FAMILY OWNS THE

12:24.844 --> 12:26.645
FIELD, HAD BEEN SLEEPLESS FOR

12:26.645 --> 12:28.481
DAYS, AND GETTING EVER MORE

12:28.481 --> 12:30.916
AGITATED ON TIKTOK--

12:30.916 --> 12:32.284
I NEED THIS VIDEO TO GO OUT

12:32.284 --> 12:33.319
FOR PEOPLE TO SEE IT AND

12:33.319 --> 12:36.155
UNDERSTAND THE RAMIFICATIONS OF

12:36.155 --> 12:37.923
WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE BORDER,

12:37.923 --> 12:39.058
AND THE LACK OF LABOR THAT WE

12:39.058 --> 12:40.626
HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY.

12:40.626 --> 12:42.528
AGITATED THAT HE

12:42.528 --> 12:43.863
COULDN'T HIRE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO

12:43.863 --> 12:46.632
PICK THE ASPARAGUS CROP, SOME

12:46.632 --> 12:48.701
$180,000 WORTH.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.669
SO, INSTEAD OF THROWING IT AWAY,

12:50.669 --> 12:51.704
HE GAVE IT AWAY.

12:51.704 --> 12:52.638
DO YOU GUYS LIKE EATING

12:52.638 --> 12:53.072
ASPARAGUS?

12:53.072 --> 12:53.739
NO.

12:53.739 --> 12:55.975
YES.

12:55.975 --> 12:58.144
OKAY, THAT THIRD GIRL

12:58.144 --> 12:59.478
IS CLEARLY TORN BETWEEN A

12:59.478 --> 13:00.746
CHILD'S NATURAL HATRED OF

13:00.746 --> 13:02.314
ASPARAGUS AND THEIR NATURAL LOVE

13:02.314 --> 13:03.682
OF DISAGREEING WITH SIBLINGS.

13:03.682 --> 13:06.418
ALSO, I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED

13:06.418 --> 13:09.021
TO ADMIT, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT'S

13:09.021 --> 13:09.655
WHAT A FIELD OF ASPARAGUS LOOKS

13:09.655 --> 13:09.955
LIKE.

13:09.955 --> 13:10.823
YOU'RE TELLING ME IT DOESN'T

13:10.823 --> 13:11.423
GROW TOGETHER IN A NICE LITTLE

13:11.423 --> 13:12.124
BUNCH?

13:12.124 --> 13:13.926
IT JUST STICKS OUT OF THE GROUND

13:13.926 --> 13:15.094
INDIVIDUALLY LIKE A BIG FIELD OF

13:15.094 --> 13:16.095
BODY HAIR?

13:16.095 --> 13:17.863
TELL ME THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

13:17.863 --> 13:19.765
YOU PUT THE JOLLY GREEN GIANT'S

13:19.765 --> 13:22.034
HAPPY TRAIL UNDER A MICROSCOPE.

13:22.034 --> 13:23.369
I'M MAD.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.371
THE POINT IS, WITHOUT ACCESS TO

13:25.371 --> 13:26.338
LABOR, CROPS JUST ROT IN THE

13:26.338 --> 13:27.072
FIELD.

13:27.072 --> 13:28.941
IT'S PROBABLY WHY FARMWORKERS

13:28.941 --> 13:30.576
WERE CATEGORIZED AS ESSENTIAL BY

13:30.576 --> 13:31.644
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

13:31.644 --> 13:33.345
SECURITY DURING THE PANDEMIC.

13:33.345 --> 13:35.614
AND YET, WHILE WE CLAIM THEY'RE

13:35.614 --> 13:37.249
ESSENTIAL, WE SUR DON'T TREAT

13:37.249 --> 13:38.884
THEM LIKE IT.

13:38.884 --> 13:40.819
FARM WORKERS ARE AMONG OUR

13:40.819 --> 13:42.021
LOWEST PAID WORKERS, MAKING ON

13:42.021 --> 13:44.323
AVERAGE IN THE RANGE OF $20,000

13:44.323 --> 13:44.790
TO $25,000 A YEAR.

13:44.790 --> 13:45.658
AND THEY'RE OFTEN SUBJECTED TO

13:45.658 --> 13:47.126
DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENTS.

13:47.126 --> 13:50.196
DURING THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE

13:50.196 --> 13:51.163
SEASON, YOU MAY'VE SEEN VIDEOS

13:51.163 --> 13:51.697
OF FARM WORKERS TOILING IN

13:51.697 --> 13:53.399
THE FOREGROUND OF A RAGING FIRE.

13:53.399 --> 13:54.500
AND EVEN WHEN THEIR WORKPLACE

13:54.500 --> 13:56.769
ISN'T ACTIVELY BURNING TO THE

13:56.769 --> 13:58.404
GROUND, THEY'LL TELL YOU--

13:58.404 --> 13:59.305
THEIR WORK CAN SOMETIMES FEEL

13:59.305 --> 14:02.508
PRETTY DEHUMANIZING.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.442
ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT

14:03.442 --> 14:05.277
THINGS IS JUST TO COME TO A

14:05.277 --> 14:08.847
REALIZATION, HOW LITTLE YOU MEAN

14:08.847 --> 14:10.382
TO THE PEOPLE THAT-- THAT YOU

14:10.382 --> 14:12.251
ARE WORKING FOR.

14:12.251 --> 14:14.753
YOU DON'T OFFICIALLY START

14:14.753 --> 14:16.121
GETTING PAID UNTIL YOUR FIRST

14:16.121 --> 14:17.423
BUCKET IS FILLED.

14:17.423 --> 14:18.891
IF YOU FALL BEHIND, YOU HAVE TO

14:18.891 --> 14:22.628
RUN TO TRY AND CATCH UP.

14:22.628 --> 14:23.796
A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN'T STAND

14:23.796 --> 14:25.397
IT BECAUSE IT'S SO HOT.

14:25.397 --> 14:26.232
SOMETIMES YOU COULD FEEL THE

14:26.232 --> 14:27.499
BREEZE FROM THE PESTICIDE THEY

14:27.499 --> 14:29.435
WERE SPRAYING OVER THERE.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.003
IT FELT GOOD.

14:31.003 --> 14:32.371
THAT'S PRETTY BRUTAL.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.606
ALTHOUGH APPRECIATING THE

14:33.606 --> 14:34.940
COOLING AIR FROM THE PESTICIDES

14:34.940 --> 14:37.109
IS SOME LEGENDARY GLASS HALF

14:37.109 --> 14:38.544
FULL THINKING.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.479
"SURE, IT'S HARD WORK, BUT THE

14:40.479 --> 14:43.015
POISON BREEZE IS NICE.

14:43.015 --> 14:43.916
SO IT KIND OF BALANCES OUT."

14:43.916 --> 14:44.883
THE WAY OUR FARM LABOR SYSTEM

14:44.883 --> 14:46.552
WORKS IS DEEPLY EXPLOITATIVE.

14:46.552 --> 14:47.686
BUT THE THING IS, THAT'S VERY

14:47.686 --> 14:49.121
MUCH BY DESIGN.

14:49.121 --> 14:52.958
SO TONIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT

14:52.958 --> 14:55.828
THE CONDITIONS THEY

14:55.828 --> 14:56.729
FACE, HOW WE'VE FAILED TO

14:56.729 --> 14:57.596
PROTECT THEM, AND WHAT WE CAN DO

14:57.596 --> 14:58.197
GOING FORWARD.

14:58.197 --> 14:58.931
AND LET'S START BY ACKNOWLEDGING

14:58.931 --> 14:59.932
THE HISTORY OF FARM WORK IN

14:59.932 --> 15:00.933
AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN ROOTED

15:00.933 --> 15:01.467
IN EXPLOITATION.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.435
FROM ITS ORIGINS IN SLAVERY, TO

15:03.435 --> 15:04.103
ITS LATER EVOLUTION INTO

15:04.103 --> 15:05.437
SHARECROPPING.

15:05.437 --> 15:06.772
BUT WHAT YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IS

15:06.772 --> 15:08.207
THAT DURING THE NEW DEAL, AS

15:08.207 --> 15:09.541
LAWS WERE FINALLY PASSED TO

15:09.541 --> 15:12.544
ESTABLISH SOME BEDROCK LABOR

15:12.544 --> 15:13.846
PROTECTIONS, FARMWORKERS WERE

15:13.846 --> 15:14.613
REPEATEDLY AND SPECIFICALLY

15:14.613 --> 15:16.649
EXCLUDED FROM THEM.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.550
SO, FOR INSTANCE, THE 1935 LAW

15:18.550 --> 15:19.618
WHICH PROTECTED EMPLOYEES'

15:19.618 --> 15:21.320
RIGHTS TO JOIN UNIONS EXPLICITLY

15:21.320 --> 15:23.589
STATED THAT "THE TERM EMPLOYEE

15:23.589 --> 15:25.491
SHALL NOT INCLUDE "ANY

15:25.491 --> 15:26.859
INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYED AS

15:26.859 --> 15:28.560
AN AGRICULTURAL LABORER".

15:28.560 --> 15:30.062
AND THE 1938 LAW WHICH CREATED A

15:30.062 --> 15:33.098
FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE AND

15:33.098 --> 15:35.067
OVERTIME, AGAIN, CARVED OUT AN

15:35.067 --> 15:36.235
EXCEPTION SO THOSE PROVISIONS

15:36.235 --> 15:37.403
SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANYONE

15:37.403 --> 15:37.903
EMPLOYED IN AGRICULTURE.

15:37.903 --> 15:39.571
WHICH IS PRETTY INSULTING.

15:39.571 --> 15:40.739
IT'S LIKE ANNOUNCING YOUR

15:40.739 --> 15:42.174
COMPANY'S NEW

15:42.174 --> 15:42.808
ANTI-SEXUAL-HARASSMENT POLICY

15:42.808 --> 15:44.109
BUT CLARIFYING THAT NONE OF IT

15:44.109 --> 15:46.378
PROTECTS JEFF.

15:46.378 --> 15:47.579
JEFF'S EXEMPT, SO: SLAP HIS ASS,

15:47.579 --> 15:49.415
TWIST HIS NIPS, WE DON'T CARE.

15:49.415 --> 15:52.518
IT'S OPEN SEASON ON JEFF.

15:52.518 --> 15:53.919
AND MAKE NO MISTAKE, THE REASONS

15:53.919 --> 15:56.555
FOR THAT WERE EXPLICITLY RACIST.

15:56.555 --> 15:57.823
ONE REPRESENTATIVE EVEN WARNED

15:57.823 --> 15:59.425
DURING DEBATE ON THE MINIMUM

15:59.425 --> 16:01.226
WAGE BILL THAT "YOU CANNOT PUT

16:01.226 --> 16:04.096
THE NEGRO AND THE WHITE MAN ON

16:04.096 --> 16:04.797
THE SAME BASIS AND GET AWAY WITH

16:04.797 --> 16:05.030
IT."

16:05.030 --> 16:07.900
THAT REPRESENTATIVE?

16:07.900 --> 16:10.769
IT WAS ACTUALLY TUCKER CARLSON.

16:10.769 --> 16:12.037
IT TURNS OUT HE'S A HIGHLANDER.

16:12.037 --> 16:13.238
NOW, SINCE THEN, THE LABOR FORCE

16:13.238 --> 16:13.605
HAS CHANGED.

16:13.605 --> 16:14.973
BLACK AMERICANS LEFT THE

16:14.973 --> 16:16.075
SHARECROPPING SYSTEM DURING THE

16:16.075 --> 16:17.142
GREAT MIGRATION, AND FARMERS

16:17.142 --> 16:18.143
INCREASINGLY CAME TO RELY ON

16:18.143 --> 16:19.144
LABORERS FROM MEXICO AND OTHER

16:19.144 --> 16:20.946
CENTRAL AMERICAN NATIONS.

16:20.946 --> 16:22.214
AND OVER THE YEARS, LEADERS LIKE

16:22.214 --> 16:23.482
CESAR CHAVEZ AND DOLORES HUERTA

16:23.482 --> 16:25.451
FORMED THE UNITED FARM WORKERS

16:25.451 --> 16:26.685
AND WON SOME SIGNIFICANT GAINS.

16:26.685 --> 16:27.686
THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE WAS

16:27.686 --> 16:29.421
EXPANDED TO INCLUDE FARMWORKERS

16:29.421 --> 16:30.322
IN 1978.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.890
AND SOME STATES DO NOW PROVIDE

16:31.890 --> 16:34.593
AT LEAST SOME ACCESS TO OVERTIME

16:34.593 --> 16:36.095
PAY AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

16:36.095 --> 16:37.730
BUT THE FACT IS, FARMWORKERS ARE

16:37.730 --> 16:42.334
STILL EXCLUDED FROM A LOT OF

16:42.334 --> 16:43.569
BASIC LABOR PROTECTIONS,

16:43.569 --> 16:44.103
INCLUDING THIS MAJOR ONE.

16:44.103 --> 16:44.703
THE CHILD LABOR LAW IN THE

16:44.703 --> 16:46.739
U.S. IS PRETTY GOOD, EXCEPT WHEN

16:46.739 --> 16:47.773
IT COMES TO AGRICULTURE.

16:47.773 --> 16:48.841
AND THEN IT HAS A BIG GAPING

16:48.841 --> 16:49.641
HOLE.

16:49.641 --> 16:51.043
U.S. LAW ALLOWS CHILDREN TO

16:51.043 --> 16:52.711
WORK IN AGRICULTURE AT FAR

16:52.711 --> 16:55.180
YOUNGER AGES FOR UNLIMITED HOURS

16:55.180 --> 16:57.316
OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL IN MUCH MORE

16:57.316 --> 16:58.717
DANGEROUS CONDITIONS THAN ANY

16:58.717 --> 17:00.419
OTHER SECTOR.

17:00.419 --> 17:01.787
SO, A CHILD CAN WORK PERFECTLY

17:01.787 --> 17:04.022
LEGALLY FOR ANY FARMER AT AGE

17:04.022 --> 17:06.058
12.

17:06.058 --> 17:07.359
THAT CHILD COULDN'T WORK SERVING

17:07.359 --> 17:08.927
THE FOOD THAT HE CAN WORK 10,

17:08.927 --> 17:11.163
12, 14 HOURS PICKING.

17:11.163 --> 17:12.264
YEAH, THAT'S ABSURD.

17:12.264 --> 17:13.866
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING WORKING

17:13.866 --> 17:16.034
IN A RESTAURANT ISN'T TOUGH,

17:16.034 --> 17:17.469
ANYONE WHO THINKS OTHERWISE

17:17.469 --> 17:20.038
SHOULD BE FORCED TO SERVE AN

17:20.038 --> 17:20.472
IMPERFECT OMELET TO

17:20.472 --> 17:21.473
JAMES CORDEN.

17:21.473 --> 17:22.741
BUT IT'S CLEARLY NOT THE SAME

17:22.741 --> 17:24.510
THING.

17:24.510 --> 17:25.544
AND THIS EXCEPTION ISN'T JUST TO

17:25.544 --> 17:26.912
LET KIDS WORK ON THEIR OWN

17:26.912 --> 17:28.347
FAMILIES' FARMS.

17:28.347 --> 17:29.715
THERE ARE HIRED CHILDREN WORKING

17:29.715 --> 17:31.116
IN FIELDS, ALL ACROSS AMERICA,

17:31.116 --> 17:33.252
PICKING OUR FOOD.

17:33.252 --> 17:36.655
BECAUSE WHILE MOST JOBS ARE

17:36.655 --> 17:39.992
OFF-LIMITS TO KIDS UNDER 14,

17:39.992 --> 17:41.160
AGRICULTURAL "EMPLOYERS MAY EVEN

17:41.160 --> 17:42.094
HIRE CHILDREN YOUNGER THAN 12 TO

17:42.094 --> 17:43.028
WORK ON SMALL FARMS WITH WRITTEN

17:43.028 --> 17:44.229
PARENTAL CONSENT."

17:44.229 --> 17:45.397
AND THIS SHOULD PROBABLY GO

17:45.397 --> 17:48.534
WITHOUT SAYING, BUT THIS WORK

17:48.534 --> 17:49.568
CAN BE DANGEROUS FOR KIDS.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.602
JUST LISTEN TO THIS GIRL, WHO

17:50.602 --> 17:52.070
STARTED WORKING IN TOBACCO

17:52.070 --> 17:53.272
FIELDS WHEN SHE WAS ONLY

17:53.272 --> 17:54.239
12, DESCRIBE HER FIRST DAY ON

17:54.239 --> 17:56.041
THE JOB.

17:56.041 --> 17:58.110
I FELT REALLY LIGHTHEADED AND

17:58.110 --> 18:00.045
DIZZY, AND I WANTED TO GO GET A

18:00.045 --> 18:03.849
CUP OF WATER AND I COULD NOT SEE

18:03.849 --> 18:05.617
TO WHERE THE TRUCK WAS THAT

18:05.617 --> 18:07.986
CONTAINED THE WATER.

18:07.986 --> 18:09.154
AND I WAS LOOKING FOR MY MOM AND

18:09.154 --> 18:12.524
I COULDN'T FIND MY MOM.

18:12.524 --> 18:14.092
EVENTUALLY, I JUST FELL.

18:14.092 --> 18:15.627
YOU DON'T REALLY THINK

18:15.627 --> 18:17.863
ABOUT A CHILDHOOD, LIKE, I'VE

18:17.863 --> 18:19.398
NEVER REALLY THOUGHT THAT A

18:19.398 --> 18:20.933
CHILD IS REALLY SUPPOSED TO-- A

18:20.933 --> 18:21.967
12-YEAR-OLD IS SUPPOSED TO

18:21.967 --> 18:23.268
HAVE FUN, EXACTLY.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.303
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE

18:24.303 --> 18:25.304
SUPPOSED TO WORK.

18:25.304 --> 18:29.775
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.243
ALTHOUGH, WHILE A 12-YEAR-OLD

18:31.243 --> 18:32.211
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE

18:32.211 --> 18:34.146
FAINTING IN A FIELD, I WILL SAY,

18:34.146 --> 18:40.452
IT'S A BIT OF A STRETCH TO SAY

18:40.452 --> 18:43.922
"A 12-YEAR-OLD IS SUPPOSED TO

18:43.922 --> 18:44.256
HAVE FUN."

18:44.256 --> 18:45.023
BECAUSE FUNDAMENTALLY, THEY ARE

18:45.023 --> 18:45.424
STILL 12.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.358
THIS IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER

18:46.358 --> 18:46.792
FOR THEM.

18:46.792 --> 18:47.392
YOU'RE A HORMONAL TICKING TIME

18:47.392 --> 18:48.594
BOMB.

18:48.594 --> 18:49.194
HONESTLY, THE CLOSEST THING TO

18:49.194 --> 18:50.629
FUN THAT'S AVAILABLE TO YOU AT

18:50.629 --> 18:51.663
12 IS GOING TO THE MALL BY

18:51.663 --> 18:53.198
YOURSELF FOR THE FIRST TIME TO

18:53.198 --> 18:53.765
JUST KIND OF WALK AROUND, I

18:53.765 --> 18:54.399
GUESS, SINCE YOU DON'T

18:54.399 --> 18:55.033
REALLY HAVE ANY MONEY EXCEPT FOR

18:55.033 --> 18:56.268
LIKE A SMOOTHIE OR SOMETHING IF

18:56.268 --> 18:56.902
YOU WANT TO GET A SMOOTHIE OR

18:56.902 --> 18:58.070
WHATEVER.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.838
THE LACK OF LAWS APPLYING TO

18:59.838 --> 19:00.906
FARMWORKERS HAS LEFT THEM FACING

19:00.906 --> 19:03.008
TRULY DANGEROUS CONDITIONS.

19:03.008 --> 19:04.176
AGRICULTURAL WORKERS SUFFER

19:04.176 --> 19:05.511
FATAL ON-THE-JOB INJURIES AT A

19:05.511 --> 19:06.945
RATE FAR HIGHER THAN POLICE

19:06.945 --> 19:09.348
OFFICERS AND MORE THAN TWICE THE

19:09.348 --> 19:10.315
RATE OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.719
WHICH IS WILD.

19:13.719 --> 19:14.753
IT'S ONE THING TO LOOK UP AT A

19:14.753 --> 19:15.687
BIG TALL BUILDING AND SHUDDER

19:15.687 --> 19:16.788
THINKING ABOUT THE PHYSICAL RISK

19:16.788 --> 19:17.990
IT MUST HAVE TAKEN TO PUT A PANE

19:17.990 --> 19:18.724
OF GLASS UP THAT HIGH.

19:18.724 --> 19:19.858
BUT IT FEELS RIDICULOUS TO FEEL

19:19.858 --> 19:22.027
THE SAME WAY ABOUT A BEET AND

19:22.027 --> 19:23.862
GOAT CHEESE SALAD.

19:23.862 --> 19:25.230
FARMWORKERS FACE EXPOSURE TO

19:25.230 --> 19:27.032
EXTREME HEAT, DANGEROUS

19:27.032 --> 19:28.300
MACHINERY, UNSAFE AIR QUALITY,

19:28.300 --> 19:30.435
AND IMPROMPTU PESTICIDE SHOWERS.

19:30.435 --> 19:31.837
AND SOME FARM OWNERS CAN BE

19:31.837 --> 19:35.440
ABUSIVE EMPLOYERS.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.375
JUST TAKE THIS STORY FROM A FEW

19:36.375 --> 19:37.042
YEARS AGO.

19:37.042 --> 19:42.014
IT'S QUIET BUT CLOUDY AT

19:42.014 --> 19:43.549
EDS SCHOENBORN ORCHARD TODAY.

19:43.549 --> 19:44.683
A LOUDMOUTH .

19:44.683 --> 19:46.418
BUT NOT ON THIS DAY.

19:46.418 --> 19:47.452
A PUNK MOTHER .

19:47.452 --> 19:49.588
IT WAS HOT.

19:49.588 --> 19:50.956
IF A COWARD

19:52.824 --> 19:54.459
THE VOICE ON TAPE, TRAVIS

19:54.459 --> 19:56.161
SCHOENBORN, THE SON OF FARM

19:56.161 --> 19:56.828
OWNERS DAVID AND VALERIE

19:56.828 --> 19:58.564
SCHOENBORN.

19:58.564 --> 20:00.165
HE WAS ANGRY AT ONE OF THE

20:00.165 --> 20:01.433
WORKERS AND LET IT BE KNOWN IN

20:01.433 --> 20:03.035
FRONT OF OTHERS.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.903
TELL HIM TO PACK HIS GOD

20:04.903 --> 20:06.405
AND GET THE

20:06.405 --> 20:08.106
OUT OF HERE WHILE HE

20:08.106 --> 20:10.842
STILL CAN.

20:10.842 --> 20:12.544
HE IS NOT WITH ME OR MY

20:12.544 --> 20:17.149
MOTHER AT ALL.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.083
HOLY SHIT, THAT WAS

20:18.083 --> 20:19.151
ABOUT 95% BLEEPS.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.385
AND TRUST LOCAL NEWS TO ALWAYS

20:20.385 --> 20:21.720
FIND A DIPLOMATIC WAY TO

20:21.720 --> 20:22.487
DESCRIBE THINGS.

20:22.487 --> 20:24.256
"HE WAS ANGRY AND LET IT BE

20:24.256 --> 20:25.424
KNOWN IN FRONT OF OTHERS".

20:25.424 --> 20:29.227
SURE.

20:29.227 --> 20:29.828
THAT'S NOT TECHNICALLY UNTRUE.

20:29.828 --> 20:30.462
BUT I'D HAVE GONE WITH THE MORE

20:30.462 --> 20:31.563
ACCURATE, "HE LOST HIS FUCKING

20:31.563 --> 20:32.998
SHIT AT AN APPLE FARM."

20:32.998 --> 20:34.700
A FARM, REMEMBER, THAT HIS

20:34.700 --> 20:35.767
PARENTS OWNED, AND THEY HAD A

20:35.767 --> 20:36.835
TRULY SPECIAL RESPONSE WHEN

20:36.835 --> 20:38.203
CONFRONTED WITH THAT VIDEO.

20:38.203 --> 20:40.105
THEY BLAME THE MIGRANT

20:40.105 --> 20:42.808
WORKER ALLEGED VICTIM IN THIS

20:42.808 --> 20:44.076
CASE, AND ACCUSE HIM OF

20:44.076 --> 20:46.478
BEING OBSCENE.

20:46.478 --> 20:47.713
WHAT DID HE DO TO THREATEN YOU?

20:47.713 --> 20:49.181
HE CALLED ME A NAME IN

20:49.181 --> 20:50.616
SPANISH, I'M NOT REPEATING IT.

20:50.616 --> 20:51.350
THERE WAS NO OUTRIGHT

20:51.350 --> 20:52.484
APOLOGY.

20:52.484 --> 20:54.019
INSTEAD, THIS.

20:54.019 --> 20:57.823
FIRST OF ALL, THEY WEREN'T

20:57.823 --> 20:59.224
BLACK, THEY WERE MEXICANS, SO I

20:59.224 --> 20:59.825
DON'T KNOW WHY HE CALLED THEM

20:59.825 --> 21:00.125
THE N-WORD.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.026
I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A

21:01.026 --> 21:01.660
CHANCE TO BE-- TO BE CLEAR AND

21:01.660 --> 21:02.260
RESPOND.

21:02.260 --> 21:03.095
YEAH.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.497
DID YOU HEAR HIM REFERRING TO

21:05.497 --> 21:09.301
PEOPLE AS " ?"

21:09.301 --> 21:10.202
WE DON'T HAVE-- WE DON'T

21:10.202 --> 21:10.802
HAVE NO WORK HERE THAT

21:10.802 --> 21:18.343
I KNOW OF.

21:18.343 --> 21:18.944
NO, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY,

21:18.944 --> 21:19.778
HERE'S THE THING.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.346
WELL, THERE'S CLEARLY NINE

21:21.346 --> 21:26.918
THOUSAND THINGS THERE, BUT

21:26.918 --> 21:27.853
HERE'S JUST ONE OF THEM.

21:27.853 --> 21:28.587
I BET YOU HEARD HER SAY "THEY

21:28.587 --> 21:29.154
WERE MEXICAN SO I'M NOT SURE

21:29.154 --> 21:30.455
WHY HE CALLED THEM THE N-WORD"

21:30.455 --> 21:31.390
AND THOUGHT, WOW, THAT'S THE

21:31.390 --> 21:32.257
WILDEST SHIT ANYBODY IN THIS

21:32.257 --> 21:33.358
MARRIAGE IS GOING TO SAY IN THE

21:33.358 --> 21:33.992
NEXT FIFTEEN SECONDS, AND THEN

21:33.992 --> 21:34.993
YOU WERE DEAD WRONG.

21:34.993 --> 21:35.961
ALSO, I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT

21:35.961 --> 21:37.696
THE INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN HAVING

21:37.696 --> 21:38.230
A PROBLEM WITH SAYING A

21:38.230 --> 21:39.731
VAGUE, UNKNOWN WORD IN SPANISH

21:39.731 --> 21:41.033
AND HAVING NO PROBLEM AT ALL

21:41.033 --> 21:42.067
SAYING AN EXTREMELY SPECIFIC ONE

21:42.067 --> 21:43.301
IN ENGLISH.

21:43.301 --> 21:44.436
"I WON'T REPEAT THIS SPANISH

21:44.436 --> 21:46.238
WORD BECAUSE IT'S OFFENSIVE, BUT

21:46.238 --> 21:49.307
IF YOU TALK TO MY HUSBAND HE'LL

21:49.307 --> 21:50.609
SAY THE N-WORD IN ABOUT FOUR

21:50.609 --> 21:52.477
SECONDS.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.745
ANYWAY, I RAISED MY SON BETTER

21:53.745 --> 21:54.379
THAN TO USE SLURS INCORRECTLY."

21:54.379 --> 21:55.514
NOW, IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE, A

21:55.514 --> 21:56.882
WORKER CAUGHT THAT TIRADE ON

21:56.882 --> 21:58.383
VIDEO AND GAVE IT TO MIGRANT

21:58.383 --> 21:59.785
LEGAL AID.

21:59.785 --> 22:02.854
AND THE SON LATER PLED GUILTY

22:02.854 --> 22:03.488
TO, OF ALL THINGS, "DISTURBING

22:03.488 --> 22:04.322
THE PEACE".

22:04.322 --> 22:05.924
BUT EVEN THAT PATHETIC LEVEL OF

22:05.924 --> 22:07.025
ACCOUNTABILITY IS EXTREMELY

22:07.025 --> 22:10.362
RARE.

22:10.362 --> 22:11.229
AND LOOK, CLEARLY, NOT ALL

22:11.229 --> 22:12.130
FARMERS ARE ABUSIVE EMPLOYERS.

22:12.130 --> 22:14.399
BUT TO THE EXTENT ANY WANT TO

22:14.399 --> 22:15.634
BE, THERE CAN BE SHOCKINGLY

22:15.634 --> 22:17.169
LITTLE TO STOP THEM.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.537
BECAUSE EVEN WHEN LABOR LAWS DO

22:18.537 --> 22:20.405
APPLY TO AGRICULTURAL WORKERS,

22:20.405 --> 22:22.607
THERE'S ALMOST NO WAY TO ENFORCE

22:22.607 --> 22:22.808
THEM.

22:22.808 --> 22:23.975
TAKE CALIFORNIA, THE MOST

22:23.975 --> 22:25.210
PRODUCTIVE AGRICULTURAL

22:25.210 --> 22:26.678
STATE IN THE NATION.

22:26.678 --> 22:27.913
THE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR

22:27.913 --> 22:29.314
MONITORING WORKPLACE SAFETY

22:29.314 --> 22:30.415
THERE IS SO UNDERSTAFFED THAT IT

22:30.415 --> 22:31.950
CURRENTLY HAS ROUGHLY ONE FIELD

22:31.950 --> 22:33.585
INSPECTOR AVAILABLE FOR EVERY

22:33.585 --> 22:35.520
90,000 WORKERS, WITH ONLY A

22:35.520 --> 22:37.222
HANDFUL OF THOSE INSPECTORS

22:37.222 --> 22:38.557
SPEAKING ANY LANGUAGE OTHER THAN

22:38.557 --> 22:39.991
ENGLISH.

22:39.991 --> 22:41.660
AND EVEN WHEN THERE ARE

22:41.660 --> 22:42.194
CONSEQUENCES, THEY CAN BE

22:42.194 --> 22:43.195
LAUGHABLE.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.731
AFTER TWO FARMWORKERS IN IDAHO

22:45.731 --> 22:47.299
DROWNED IN PITS OF COW MANURE AT

22:47.299 --> 22:49.701
DAIRY OPERATIONS, OSHA IMPOSED

22:49.701 --> 22:53.472
FINES OF JUST $5,000 FOR EACH OF

22:53.472 --> 22:53.905
THE MENS' DEATHS.

22:53.905 --> 22:54.773
WHICH IS NOTHING.

22:54.773 --> 22:57.109
IF AN EMPLOYEE DROWNS IN THE

22:57.109 --> 22:58.577
UNIVERSALLY-AGREED-UPON "WORST

22:58.577 --> 23:00.378
THING TO DROWN IN," THAT SHOULD

23:00.378 --> 23:02.547
COST THEIR EMPLOYER A LOT MORE

23:02.547 --> 23:03.115
THAN A FIFTH OF A HYUNDAI

23:03.115 --> 23:04.549
SONATA.

23:04.549 --> 23:05.717
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN GETTING INTO

23:05.717 --> 23:07.385
THE FACT THAT SOME FARMS LIMIT

23:07.385 --> 23:08.854
THEIR LIABILITY BY USING

23:08.854 --> 23:10.622
SO-CALLED "FARM LABOR

23:10.622 --> 23:11.757
CONTRACTORS", WHO HIRE WORKERS

23:11.757 --> 23:12.557
AND THEN CONTRACT THEM

23:12.557 --> 23:17.028
OUT, AND WHO'VE BEEN FOUND TO BE

23:17.028 --> 23:19.931
THE WORST VIOLATORS OF

23:19.931 --> 23:20.866
EMPLOYMENT LAW IN AGRICULTURE.

23:20.866 --> 23:21.700
SOME OF THEM HAVE CONFISCATED

23:21.700 --> 23:22.734
WORKERS PASSPORTS, CHARGED THEM

23:22.734 --> 23:25.137
IF THEY WANTED TO QUIT THEIR

23:25.137 --> 23:26.905
JOBS, OR THREATENED THEM WITH

23:26.905 --> 23:27.239
DEPORTATION.

23:27.239 --> 23:27.839
SO AT EVERY TURN, THIS IS AN

23:27.839 --> 23:28.607
ENVIRONMENT WHERE VULNERABLE

23:28.607 --> 23:30.075
WORKERS CAN UNDERSTANDABLY FEEL

23:30.075 --> 23:31.109
RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD.

23:31.109 --> 23:33.111
TAKE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND

23:33.111 --> 23:35.447
ASSAULT, WHICH FARM WORKERS SAY

23:35.447 --> 23:37.182
IS A BIG PROBLEM-- AND YET,

23:37.182 --> 23:39.017
JUST WATCH HOW THIS HEAD OF A

23:39.017 --> 23:39.651
FARMOWNERS' TRADE GROUP RESPONDS

23:39.651 --> 23:41.219
WHEN ASKED ABOUT IT.

23:41.219 --> 23:42.587
YOU KNOW DOLORES HUERTA, YOU

23:42.587 --> 23:43.588
KNOW WHO SHE IS.

23:43.588 --> 23:44.790
YES.

23:44.790 --> 23:45.490
CAN I READ YOU SOMETHING SHE

23:45.490 --> 23:46.658
SAID?

23:46.658 --> 23:47.592
OH, PLEASE.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.628
I'D LIKE TO HEAR HER COMMENT.

23:49.628 --> 23:51.029
OKAY.

23:51.029 --> 23:51.963
SHE SAYS THAT THIS SEXUAL

23:51.963 --> 23:53.932
HARASSMENT THAT WE'RE TALKING

23:53.932 --> 23:54.933
ABOUT IS AN EPIDEMIC IN THE

23:54.933 --> 23:56.268
FIELDS.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.469
DOLORES HUERTA, BRING ME

23:57.469 --> 23:58.737
THOSE CASES.

23:58.737 --> 24:00.505
DOLORES HUERTA, GO HAVE

24:00.505 --> 24:02.340
YOUR UFW GO PICKET THE GROWER IF

24:02.340 --> 24:03.775
ALL THESE CASES HAVE BEEN GOING

24:03.775 --> 24:05.410
ON.

24:05.410 --> 24:06.611
IF OUR GROWERS KNOW THERE IS A

24:06.611 --> 24:07.212
PROBLEM, WE ARE GOING TO DEAL

24:07.212 --> 24:08.580
WITH IT.

24:08.580 --> 24:10.916
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO TO THE GROWER?

24:10.916 --> 24:12.384
AND TELL ME THAT, "BECAUSE,

24:12.384 --> 24:14.586
WELL, WE WERE FEARFUL FOR

24:14.586 --> 24:15.220
THEIR JOBS AND THEIR LIVES."

24:15.220 --> 24:18.523
NO, THAT'S A POOR EXCUSE.

24:18.523 --> 24:20.725
YEAH, IS IT, THOUGH?

24:20.725 --> 24:21.226
IS IT?

24:21.226 --> 24:21.960
BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO SAY, I CAN

24:21.960 --> 24:23.562
BELIEVE PEOPLE AREN'T BRINGING

24:23.562 --> 24:24.629
HARASSMENT CASES TO GROWERS, IF

24:24.629 --> 24:25.263
THEY'RE ACTING ANYTHING LIKE HE

24:25.263 --> 24:26.198
JUST DID.

24:26.198 --> 24:27.766
AFTER ALL, MERELY HEARING THE

24:27.766 --> 24:29.167
NAME "DOLORES HUERTA" SENT HIM

24:29.167 --> 24:30.902
INTO A VISIBLE RAGE, SO I HAVE

24:30.902 --> 24:33.038
TO IMAGINE OFF-CAMERA HE'S EVEN

24:33.038 --> 24:35.140
MORE OF A TEDDY BEAR.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.274
AND AT THIS POINT, YOU MIGHT BE

24:36.274 --> 24:37.375
THINKING, "PERHAPS ONE WAY TO

24:37.375 --> 24:38.910
HELP WORKERS WOULD BE TO REMOVE

24:38.910 --> 24:40.245
THEIR FEAR OF DEPORTATION, AND

24:40.245 --> 24:41.980
CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE THEY CAN

24:41.980 --> 24:45.183
COME INTO THIS COUNTRY LEGALLY."

24:45.183 --> 24:45.750
WELL, WE ACTUALLY DID THAT.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.385
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY WE DID

24:47.385 --> 24:48.687
IT LEFT MASSIVE GAPS FOR BAD

24:48.687 --> 24:50.655
ACTORS TO OPERATE IN.

24:50.655 --> 24:52.591
BACK IN 1986, WE CREATED WHAT'S

24:52.591 --> 24:53.992
KNOWN AS THE H2-A VISA PROGRAM.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.560
IT ALLOWS MIGRANT WORKERS TO

24:55.560 --> 24:57.162
LEGALLY ENTER THE COUNTRY

24:57.162 --> 24:57.729
TEMPORARILY FOR AGRICULTURAL

24:57.729 --> 24:59.664
WORK.

24:59.664 --> 25:01.099
FOR YEARS, EMPLOYERS SHIED AWAY

25:01.099 --> 25:02.667
FROM USING IT, BECAUSE IT WAS

25:02.667 --> 25:04.102
CHEAPER AND EASIER TO SIMPLY

25:04.102 --> 25:05.303
HIRE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS.

25:05.303 --> 25:06.938
BUT AS IT'S BECOME HARDER TO

25:06.938 --> 25:08.106
FIND THEM, THE USE OF H-2A HAS

25:08.106 --> 25:10.442
BEEN RAMPED UP CONSIDERABLY.

25:10.442 --> 25:12.611
IN FACT, THE NUMBER OF H-2A

25:12.611 --> 25:13.945
POSITIONS HAS INCREASED MORE

25:13.945 --> 25:14.546
THAN SEVENFOLD IN THE PAST 17

25:14.546 --> 25:15.680
YEARS.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.450
BASICALLY, THE PROGRAM'S BEEN

25:18.450 --> 25:20.285
AROUND SINCE THE '80S, WAS ON

25:20.285 --> 25:21.453
THE BACKBURNER UNTIL A FEW YEARS

25:21.453 --> 25:22.053
AGO, AND NOW IT'S EXTREMELY

25:22.053 --> 25:22.520
POPULAR.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.189
THINK OF IT AS THE KIERAN CULKIN

25:24.189 --> 25:26.024
OF THE AGRICULTURAL WORLD.

25:26.024 --> 25:26.992
AND, IN PRINCIPLE, H-2A DOES

25:26.992 --> 25:28.660
SOUND GOOD.

25:28.660 --> 25:29.895
MORE FARMWORKERS GET TEMPORARY

25:29.895 --> 25:31.396
LEGAL STATUS, WHICH, YOU'D

25:31.396 --> 25:32.163
ASSUME, WOULD MAKE THEM FEEL

25:32.163 --> 25:32.864
SAFER.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.866
BUT SADLY, THAT HASN'T BEEN THE

25:34.866 --> 25:35.967
CASE.

25:35.967 --> 25:37.335
FOR ONE THING, LIKE MANY WORK

25:37.335 --> 25:39.838
VISAS, THESE ARE TIED TO YOUR

25:39.838 --> 25:41.239
EMPLOYER.

25:41.239 --> 25:41.806
SO IF YOU LOSE YOUR JOB, YOU

25:41.806 --> 25:42.941
ALSO LOSE YOUR RIGHT TO BE

25:42.941 --> 25:44.075
IN THE COUNTRY, CAUSING A

25:44.075 --> 25:44.576
MASSIVE POWER IMBALANCE.

25:44.576 --> 25:45.810
AND GIVEN THAT IMBALANCE, IT'S

25:45.810 --> 25:47.479
NO SURPRISE MANY EMPLOYERS FEEL

25:47.479 --> 25:48.613
COMFORTABLE SKIRTING THE

25:48.613 --> 25:50.015
PROTECTIONS WORKERS ARE SUPPOSED

25:50.015 --> 25:51.216
TO RECEIVE.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.550
FOR INSTANCE, UNDER THE LAW,

25:52.550 --> 25:55.153
EMPLOYERS MUST PROVIDE HOUSING

25:55.153 --> 25:56.388
FOR THEIR H-2A WORKERS.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.223
BUT IN PRACTICE, THE CONDITIONS

25:58.223 --> 25:59.557
CAN BE FAR BELOW WHAT THE

25:59.557 --> 26:00.158
PROGRAM REQUIRES, AS THIS MAN

26:00.158 --> 26:03.361
QUICKLY FOUND OUT.

26:03.361 --> 26:04.796
THE HOUSE WHERE WE LIVED,

26:04.796 --> 26:05.897
WHERE MANUEL BROUGHT US TO, WAS

26:05.897 --> 26:07.165
VERY OLD.

26:07.165 --> 26:11.736
IT HAD SPIDERS, COCKROACHES, AND

26:11.736 --> 26:12.470
THE BATHROOMS DIDN'T WORK.

26:12.470 --> 26:12.904
THE HOUSE WAS GROSS.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.472
IT WAS VERY DIRTY.

26:14.472 --> 26:16.107
YOU COULD CLEARLY TELL THAT THE

26:16.107 --> 26:17.409
HOUSE WAS ABANDONED FOR A LONG

26:17.409 --> 26:17.943
TIME AND MANUEL BROUGHT US

26:17.943 --> 26:18.910
THERE.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.879
THE HOUSE DIDN'T HAVE HEAT, AND

26:20.879 --> 26:21.947
THE TEMPERATURE HIT SIX DEGREES

26:21.947 --> 26:23.181
CELSIUS.

26:23.181 --> 26:24.983
AND FOUR OF MY COWORKERS AND I

26:24.983 --> 26:26.418
HAD TO SLEEP OUTSIDE.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.152
WE FELT LIKE WE WERE ON THE

26:27.152 --> 26:31.389
BORDER OF DEATH.

26:31.389 --> 26:31.923
THAT IS HORRIFIC.

26:31.923 --> 26:32.524
NO ONE WOULD SEE THAT AND SAY,

26:32.524 --> 26:33.391
"THAT'S A GOOD PLACE FOR PEOPLE

26:33.391 --> 26:34.859
TO LIVE."

26:34.859 --> 26:36.861
THEY'D MAYBE SAY, "THAT'S A NICE

26:36.861 --> 26:38.263
SPOT FOR GHOSTS TO THROW UP,"

26:38.263 --> 26:39.798
BUT THAT'S IT.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.499
AND THAT'S NOT A ONE-OFF.

26:41.499 --> 26:42.133
A DOL INVESTIGATION A FEW YEARS

26:42.133 --> 26:43.969
BACK FOUND ONE LABOR CONTRACTOR

26:43.969 --> 26:47.005
HOUSED H-2A WORKERS IN AN OLD

26:47.005 --> 26:47.605
COUNTY JAIL THAT HAD RECENTLY

26:47.605 --> 26:48.773
SERVED AS THE COMMUNITY'S

26:48.773 --> 26:50.241
HALLOWEEN HAUNTED HOUSE.

26:50.241 --> 26:51.977
THIS IS THE KITCHEN, WHICH, YOU

26:51.977 --> 26:53.812
CAN SEE, STILL HAD FAKE BLOOD ON

26:53.812 --> 26:55.447
THE REFRIGERATORS AND THE FLOOR.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.716
AND WORKERS SHOULDN'T BE FORCED

26:57.716 --> 26:59.351
TO SLEEP AROUND A BUNCH OF

26:59.351 --> 27:02.721
SPOOKY DECORATIONS.

27:02.721 --> 27:03.321
EVEN PEOPLE WHO WORK AT SPIRIT

27:03.321 --> 27:03.888
HALLOWEEN DON'T SLEEP IN THE

27:03.888 --> 27:04.889
STORE.

27:04.889 --> 27:06.324
EXCEPT, OF COURSE, FOR DENNIS,

27:06.324 --> 27:07.559
BUT HE'S MADE IT VERY CLEAR

27:07.559 --> 27:10.395
THAT THAT'S A SEX THING.

27:10.395 --> 27:11.696
BUT POOR LIVING ACCOMMODATIONS

27:11.696 --> 27:13.498
ARE JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

27:13.498 --> 27:14.966
IN 2021, THE DOJ LAUNCHED A

27:14.966 --> 27:17.369
MASSIVE INDICTMENT INVOLVING THE

27:17.369 --> 27:18.870
TREATMENT OF H-2A WORKERS ON

27:18.870 --> 27:20.205
GEORGIA FARMS.

27:20.205 --> 27:26.444
AND THE DETAILS ARE APPALLING.

27:26.444 --> 27:26.911
"MODERN-DAY SLAVERY."

27:26.911 --> 27:31.316
IN THE FIELDS OF SOUTHERN

27:31.316 --> 27:32.083
GEORGIA, YEARS WORTH OF DAMNING,

27:32.083 --> 27:32.851
HORRIFIC ALLEGATIONS.

27:32.851 --> 27:33.451
VICTIMS ALLEGEDLY FORCED TO LIVE

27:33.451 --> 27:34.719
IN CRAMPED, DIRTY TRAILERS WITH

27:34.719 --> 27:38.623
RAW SEWAGE LEAKING INTO THE

27:38.623 --> 27:39.224
TRAILERS, THREATENED THEM WITH

27:39.224 --> 27:40.058
DEPORTATION, AND DETAINED THEM

27:40.058 --> 27:41.059
IN A WORK CAMP SURROUNDED BY AN

27:41.059 --> 27:43.094
ELECTRIC FENCE.

27:43.094 --> 27:45.296
AND IN 2018, 30, INDIVIDUALS

27:45.296 --> 27:47.899
ALLEGEDLY SOLD TO ANOTHER MAN IN

27:47.899 --> 27:53.238
INDIANA FOR $21,481 DOLLARS.

27:53.238 --> 27:54.439
WOW.

27:54.439 --> 27:56.708
YOU KNOW, AT TIMES, SOME PEOPLE

27:56.708 --> 27:58.309
CAN BE QUICK TO PLAY THE "THIS

27:58.309 --> 27:59.277
IS SLAVERY" CARD, WHETHER YOU'RE

27:59.277 --> 28:00.745
A TEENAGER ASKED TO MOW THE

28:00.745 --> 28:02.514
LAWN, OR AN OFFICE WORKER WHO

28:02.514 --> 28:03.848
HAS TO COME IN ON SUNDAY.

28:03.848 --> 28:04.883
BUT AS FRUSTRATING AS THOSE

28:04.883 --> 28:06.451
SITUATIONS CAN BE, NEITHER

28:06.451 --> 28:07.819
INVOLVES BEING SOLD IN BULK TO A

28:07.819 --> 28:09.487
MAN IN INDIANA.

28:09.487 --> 28:10.188
BECAUSE THAT'S ACTUAL FUCKING

28:10.188 --> 28:13.725
SLAVERY.

28:13.725 --> 28:14.325
THIS CASE IS ONGOING, BUT THE

28:14.325 --> 28:15.026
INDICTMENT ASSERTS THIS WAS A

28:15.026 --> 28:16.361
MASSIVE OPERATION, WHICH SOUGHT

28:16.361 --> 28:17.562
VISAS FOR OVER 71,000 FOREIGN

28:17.562 --> 28:19.097
WORKERS TO HARVEST ONIONS AND

28:19.097 --> 28:20.832
OTHER CROPS.

28:20.832 --> 28:23.101
AND THE GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT AT

28:23.101 --> 28:23.735
LEAST TWO DIED AS A RESULT OF

28:23.735 --> 28:25.703
THE WORKPLACE CONDITIONS THERE.

28:25.703 --> 28:27.472
AND WHILE I'M GLAD ACTION WAS

28:27.472 --> 28:29.340
EVENTUALLY TAKEN, I WILL SAY:

28:29.340 --> 28:31.943
FOR A LIST OF CHARGES THIS

28:31.943 --> 28:33.478
SINISTER, THE NAME THEY CHOSE...

28:33.478 --> 28:34.813
COULD HAVE USED SOME WORK.

28:34.813 --> 28:36.514
A NEW 54-PAGE INDICTMENT

28:36.514 --> 28:38.149
BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF

28:38.149 --> 28:41.186
JUSTICE, CHARGING 24 INDIVIDUALS

28:41.186 --> 28:43.822
AS PART OF WHAT IT CALLS

28:43.822 --> 28:45.290
"OPERATION: BLOOMING ONION".

28:45.290 --> 28:47.892
OKAY.

28:47.892 --> 28:49.327
OKAY.

28:49.327 --> 28:50.261
JUST POUR ONE OUT FOR THE SOCIAL

28:50.261 --> 28:54.666
MEDIA PERSON AT OUTBACK

28:54.666 --> 28:56.201
STEAKHOUSE WHO SAW "BLOOMING

28:56.201 --> 28:57.235
ONION" TRENDING ON TWITTER AND

28:57.235 --> 28:57.702
THOUGHT THEIR JOB GOT

28:57.702 --> 28:58.303
EASIER FOR TWO SECONDS BEFORE

28:58.303 --> 28:58.937
REALIZING IT ACTUALLY JUST GOT A

28:58.937 --> 28:59.237
LOT HARDER.

28:59.237 --> 29:00.538
AND AT THIS POINT, I'VE TOLD YOU

29:00.538 --> 29:01.539
ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM CHILD

29:01.539 --> 29:04.375
LABOR TO WORKERS DROWNING IN

29:04.375 --> 29:05.877
MANURE, TO THE SALE OF HUMAN

29:05.877 --> 29:10.014
BEINGS, SO YOU'RE HOPEFULLY

29:10.014 --> 29:10.949
WONDERING HOW DO WE FIX THIS?

29:10.949 --> 29:12.016
WELL, FARM WORKERS HAVE BEEN

29:12.016 --> 29:12.884
ORGANIZING TO ADDRESS SOME OF

29:12.884 --> 29:13.585
THESE ISSUES FOR YEARS.

29:13.585 --> 29:14.385
TAKE WHAT HAPPENED IN IMMOKALEE,

29:14.385 --> 29:14.786
FLORIDA.

29:14.786 --> 29:15.720
AS RECENTLY AS A DECADE AGO, THE

29:15.720 --> 29:17.255
TOMATO FIELDS THERE WERE BEING

29:17.255 --> 29:20.825
CALLED "GROUND ZERO FOR

29:20.825 --> 29:21.793
MODERN-DAY SLAVERY".

29:21.793 --> 29:23.361
BUT A GROUP CALLED THE COALITION

29:23.361 --> 29:26.464
OF IMMOKALEE WORKERS LAUNCHED A

29:26.464 --> 29:27.065
CAMPAIGN TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS

29:27.065 --> 29:27.899
PRESSURING NOT JUST

29:27.899 --> 29:28.433
FARMERS, BUT THE BIG NAME

29:28.433 --> 29:29.067
BUSINESSES THAT RELIED ON THEIR

29:29.067 --> 29:31.035
PRODUCE.

29:31.035 --> 29:32.036
IN 2005, TACO BELL BECAME THE

29:32.036 --> 29:34.305
FIRST BIG BUYER TO SIGN ON TO

29:34.305 --> 29:36.474
THE CIW'S FAIR FOOD PROGRAM.

29:36.474 --> 29:38.610
BUYERS AGREE TO PAY AN EXTRA

29:38.610 --> 29:40.411
PENNY PER POUND FOR TOMATO,

29:40.411 --> 29:41.646
MONEY THAT GOES TO WORKERS, AND

29:41.646 --> 29:43.915
BUYERS ONLY DO BUSINESS WITH

29:43.915 --> 29:46.117
PARTICIPATING FLORIDA FARMERS.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.819
MORE THAN A DOZEN RESTAURANT

29:47.819 --> 29:50.955
CHAINS AND RETAILERS HAVE SIGNED

29:50.955 --> 29:51.556
ON, INCLUDING McDONALDS,

29:51.556 --> 29:53.491
CHIPOTLE, TRADER JOES, AND

29:53.491 --> 29:56.928
LAST YEAR WALMART, WHICH SELLS

29:56.928 --> 29:58.563
20% OF AMERICA'S TOMATOES.

29:58.563 --> 29:59.731
WOW, THOSE ARE SOME

29:59.731 --> 30:01.900
MASSIVE BRANDS THAT YOU CAN NOW,

30:01.900 --> 30:05.937
SURPRISINGLY, FEEL KIND OF OKAY

30:05.937 --> 30:06.538
ABOUT IN THIS ONE VERY NARROW

30:06.538 --> 30:07.138
WAY.

30:07.138 --> 30:07.872
IS WALMART A GOOD COMPANY

30:07.872 --> 30:08.706
OVERALL?

30:08.706 --> 30:10.642
IT'S NOT UP TO ME TO SAY, BUT

30:10.642 --> 30:11.142
LET'S SAY: NO.

30:11.142 --> 30:13.011
IT'S TERRIBLE.

30:13.011 --> 30:14.245
BUT IS IT A GOOD COMPANY

30:14.245 --> 30:15.413
REGARDING THE TOMATOES IT SELLS

30:15.413 --> 30:16.281
FROM FLORIDA SPECIFICALLY?

30:16.281 --> 30:17.582
SURE.

30:17.582 --> 30:19.184
ON THAT ONE ISSUE, THEY HAVE MY

30:19.184 --> 30:21.085
FULL, FLORIDA-TOMATO-SPECIFIC

30:21.085 --> 30:22.554
SUPPORT.

30:22.554 --> 30:23.788
WHICH IS FRANKLY MORE THAN I CAN

30:23.788 --> 30:25.990
SAY FOR WENDYS, KROGER AND

30:25.990 --> 30:26.891
PUBLIX, WHO-- AMAZINGLY-- HAVE

30:26.891 --> 30:27.692
YET TO SIGN ON.

30:27.692 --> 30:33.865
SO FUCK THEM.

30:33.865 --> 30:34.365
EXACTLY!

30:34.365 --> 30:34.933
UNDER THE FAIR FOOD PROGRAM,

30:34.933 --> 30:37.035
SIGNATORIES AGREED TO PURCHASE

30:37.035 --> 30:38.269
ONLY FROM GROWERS WHO

30:38.269 --> 30:39.737
IMPLEMENTED A HUMAN

30:39.737 --> 30:40.572
RIGHTS-BASED CODE OF CONDUCT ON

30:40.572 --> 30:41.706
THEIR FARMS.

30:41.706 --> 30:43.208
IT ALSO COVERS A 24/7 COMPLAINT

30:43.208 --> 30:44.776
LINE FOR WORKERS, AND, PERHAPS

30:44.776 --> 30:45.410
MOST IMPORTANTLY, AN INDEPENDENT

30:45.410 --> 30:46.344
REGULATORY BODY THAT CONDUCTS

30:46.344 --> 30:47.946
AUDITS IN WHICH THEY INTERVIEW

30:47.946 --> 30:49.681
AT LEAST HALF THE WORKFORCE.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.382
AND IT'S BEEN A SUCCESS.

30:51.382 --> 30:53.117
THE VAST MAJORITY OF TOMATO

30:53.117 --> 30:55.019
HARVESTERS IN FLORIDA HAVE

30:55.019 --> 30:56.754
JOINED THE PROGRAM, RAISING

30:56.754 --> 30:57.355
WAGES FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

30:57.355 --> 30:58.790
WORKERS.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.525
AND THE PROGRAM'S NOW EXPANDING

31:00.525 --> 31:01.492
INTO OTHER CROPS AND OTHER

31:01.492 --> 31:02.327
STATES.

31:02.327 --> 31:03.728
BUT IT CLEARLY SHOULDN'T JUST BE

31:03.728 --> 31:04.729
ON FARMWORKERS TO FIGHT FOR A

31:04.729 --> 31:06.497
DECENT LIFE.

31:06.497 --> 31:07.732
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

31:07.732 --> 31:09.200
THEY'RE AT LEAST PROTECTED BY

31:09.200 --> 31:11.502
THE SAME LABOR LAWS THE REST OF

31:11.502 --> 31:12.170
US ENJOY.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.304
AND MAKE SURE THOSE LAWS ARE

31:13.304 --> 31:14.672
ENFORCED.

31:14.672 --> 31:16.307
AND I'D ARGUE WE ALSO NEED TO

31:16.307 --> 31:18.142
RETOOL THE H-2A PROGRAM AND

31:18.142 --> 31:19.277
ENSURE ITS PARTICIPANTS-- AND

31:19.277 --> 31:21.045
IDEALLY ALL FARMWORKERS-- HAVE

31:21.045 --> 31:22.580
A POTENTIAL PATH TO CITIZENSHIP.

31:22.580 --> 31:24.315
BECAUSE AFTER WORKING SO HARD TO

31:24.315 --> 31:25.583
FEED THIS COUNTRY, FRANKLY, THEY

31:25.583 --> 31:27.418
DESERVE ONE.

31:27.418 --> 31:29.220
AFTER ALL, YOU MADE ME A CITIZEN

31:29.220 --> 31:32.090
AND I HAVEN'T FED YOU ONCE.

31:32.090 --> 31:33.291
I KNOW YOU THINK I HAVE, BUT

31:33.291 --> 31:34.726
THAT'S JAMIE OLIVER, AND WE'RE

31:34.726 --> 31:38.162
DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.664
LOOK, FARM WORKERS PROVIDE THIS

31:39.664 --> 31:41.099
COUNTRY WITH OUR MOST BASIC

31:41.099 --> 31:42.267
NECESSITY, AND IN RETURN WE ACT

31:42.267 --> 31:43.568
LIKE THEY EITHER DON'T MATTER OR

31:43.568 --> 31:44.936
DON'T EXIST.

31:44.936 --> 31:46.838
THE MESSAGE WE'VE SENT TO THEM

31:46.838 --> 31:47.972
"YOU

31:47.972 --> 31:49.607
DON'T COUNT."

31:49.607 --> 31:51.709
AND UNTIL WE FIX OUR BROKEN

31:51.709 --> 31:54.145
SYSTEM, THE VERY LEAST WE CAN DO

31:54.145 --> 31:55.313
IS FIX OUR "FARMING SIMULATOR"

31:55.313 --> 31:56.581
GAMES SO EVERYONE'S FORCED TO

31:56.581 --> 31:57.815
HAVE A MUCH MORE ACCURATE SENSE

31:57.815 --> 31:59.284
OF WHAT THE PEOPLE WHO GROW

31:59.284 --> 31:59.817
THEIR FOOD ARE ACTUALLY UP

31:59.817 --> 32:01.986
AGAINST.

32:04.922 --> 32:09.627
WELCOME TO THE NEW FARMING

32:09.627 --> 32:10.295
SIMULATOR 2023.

32:10.295 --> 32:12.430
ALL YOUR FAVORITE FEATURES ARE

32:12.430 --> 32:14.499
BACK.

32:14.499 --> 32:16.501
BEAUTIFUL VISTAS, TOUGH WORKING

32:16.501 --> 32:18.870
TRACTORS, AND OF COURSE, ANIMAL

32:18.870 --> 32:19.837
HUSBANDRY.

32:19.837 --> 32:21.939
BUT THIS YEAR, WE ARE ALSO

32:21.939 --> 32:23.374
EXPANDING TO INCLUDE THE PARTS

32:23.374 --> 32:24.275
OF FARMING MOST PEOPLE DON'T

32:24.275 --> 32:27.745
LIKE TO THINK ABOUT.

32:27.745 --> 32:28.946
HIRED FARM WORKERS.

32:28.946 --> 32:29.714
WE ARE BRINGING CUTTING-EDGE

32:29.714 --> 32:32.650
GRAPHICS AND GAME PLAY INTO THE

32:32.650 --> 32:33.217
MOST IGNORED ASPECT OF

32:33.217 --> 32:34.252
AGRICULTURE.

32:34.252 --> 32:37.455
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

32:37.455 --> 32:38.656
HIRING UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WITH

32:38.656 --> 32:40.725
NO PROTECTIONS AGAINST ABUSE OR

32:40.725 --> 32:42.694
THE LEGAL VERSION OF THAT.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.562
YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THEIR CLOTHES,

32:44.562 --> 32:46.597
THEIR HAIR, AND EVEN CHOOSE FROM

32:46.597 --> 32:48.366
A SURPRISING RANGE OF AGES FROM

32:48.366 --> 32:51.269
OLDER TO YOUNGER, TOO DEAR GOD

32:51.269 --> 32:53.805
HOW ON EARTH IS THIS LEGAL?

32:53.805 --> 32:55.973
WE ALSO HAVE A BRAND-NEW

32:55.973 --> 32:57.709
ASSORTMENT OF MAPS.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.711
FROM MIDWESTERN FIELDS, TO VAST

32:59.711 --> 33:02.113
ASPARAGUS TANKS, TO LITERALLY

33:02.113 --> 33:04.315
THE MIDDLE OF A RAGING WILDFIRE.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.883
AND IF YOUR WORKERS NEED A PEP

33:05.883 --> 33:06.918
TALK, YOU CAN HELP THEM OUT WITH

33:06.918 --> 33:10.588
OUR NEW MOTIVATIONAL MINIGAME.

33:10.588 --> 33:14.025
YOU !

33:14.025 --> 33:17.195
IF YOU SAY ONE MORE

33:17.195 --> 33:17.762
AGAINST MY SISTER!

33:17.762 --> 33:21.466
MY DAD OR MY !

33:21.466 --> 33:22.400
NOW GET BACK TO WORK!

33:22.400 --> 33:24.702
YOUR ODDS OF GETTING CAUGHT

33:24.702 --> 33:26.104
ARE PRACTICALLY ZERO!

33:26.104 --> 33:28.306
OH, SHIT.

33:28.306 --> 33:33.644
YOU CAN USE OUR NEW HOUSING TOOL

33:33.644 --> 33:34.445
TO DESIGN NEW COMPLIANT HOUSING

33:34.445 --> 33:35.279
FOR YOUR RECORDS.

33:35.279 --> 33:37.348
THE LESS YOU SPEND, THE MORE YOU

33:37.348 --> 33:37.548
SAVE!

33:37.548 --> 33:39.851
AND ALL OF THIS IS TO PUT FOOD

33:39.851 --> 33:42.587
ON THE TABLE OF PEOPLE WHO WILL

33:42.587 --> 33:43.187
NEVER ONCE THINK ABOUT HOW IT

33:43.187 --> 33:45.656
GOT THERE.

33:45.656 --> 33:46.858
JUST REMEMBER, THE REAL SECRET

33:46.858 --> 33:49.160
TO MASTERING FARMING IS BEING

33:49.160 --> 33:51.262
THE MASTER OF OTHER PEOPLE.

33:51.262 --> 33:54.132
WAIT, NOT THAT.

33:54.132 --> 33:57.835
I GUESS KIND OF THAT.

33:57.835 --> 34:00.872
FARMING SIMULATOR 2023.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.373
RAY DID NOT FOR ANYONE.

34:02.373 --> 34:03.341
THAT'S OUR SHOW!

34:03.341 --> 34:03.975
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

34:03.975 --> 34:04.275
GOOD NIGHT!
