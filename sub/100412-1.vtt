00:33.100 --> 00:35.601
-All personnel,
prepare to disembark.

00:35.603 --> 00:39.471
Grab what you need and get
to the front of the ship.

00:39.473 --> 00:40.506
<i> -Attention, vessel!</i>

00:40.508 --> 00:44.109
<i> You are in violation</i>
<i> of Coalition regulations.</i>

00:44.111 --> 00:45.511
What the--?

00:45.579 --> 00:46.612
<i> Further transgression</i>

00:46.614 --> 00:50.716
<i> will be considered</i>
<i> a declaration of war!</i>

00:51.052 --> 00:53.452
<i> Deactivate your</i>
<i> light-speed engines</i>

00:53.454 --> 00:56.121
<i> and prepare to be boarded!</i>

00:56.123 --> 00:58.357
-Ajax, tell me
you're in position.

00:58.359 --> 00:59.792
We're coming in hot!

00:59.794 --> 01:02.528
And we got company.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.734
[thud]

01:12.306 --> 01:17.743
Look, buddy. I need you to hear
me out. I'm not your enemy.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.145
-Yield.

01:20.147 --> 01:22.181
-Screw it.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.825
Ajax, where are you?
We're ready for pickup!

01:32.827 --> 01:35.861
<i> -You didn't tell me there</i>
<i> was gonna be a Paladin.</i>

01:35.863 --> 01:37.096
<i> Too much risk!</i>

01:37.098 --> 01:39.398
-Ajax, you leave us
out here, we're dead!

01:39.400 --> 01:40.365
We need your ship!

01:40.367 --> 01:42.401
<i> -You've got a ship,</i>
<i> use it!</i>

01:42.403 --> 01:45.637
-That wasn't part of
the plan, Ajax!

01:45.639 --> 01:47.739
Ajax!

01:50.878 --> 01:53.779
-Disengage the engines
and step away from the console.

01:53.781 --> 01:59.418
-I can't, or everyone
on this ship will die!

01:59.420 --> 02:02.421
-Commander Corbryn...

02:02.423 --> 02:04.256
I don't understand.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.358
The Coalition reported
this ship stolen.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.793
Why are you so far off course?

02:07.795 --> 02:10.729
Commander Corbryn,
by Order of the Coalition,

02:10.731 --> 02:12.231
stop this ship now!

02:12.233 --> 02:14.733
-We no longer answer to
the Coalition of Planets.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.136
[gunshot]
-Treason, Commander!

02:17.138 --> 02:18.403
This is an act of war!

02:18.405 --> 02:20.839
-The Coalition aren't
the good guys anymore.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.275
You're a Paladin!
Can't you see that?

02:23.277 --> 02:26.512
-War against the Coalition
is a fight you cannot win.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.747
-Well, we don't want a fight.
We want out!

02:28.749 --> 02:31.617
We want a planet of our own
and we're not turning back,

02:31.619 --> 02:32.751
not when we're this close.

02:32.753 --> 02:36.622
-This close to what?
There's nothing...

02:37.858 --> 02:40.292
Nothing out there.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.329
-I'm trusting you to
do the right thing.

02:44.331 --> 02:47.799
Coalition doesn't know it's here
and they don't have to.

02:48.836 --> 02:49.801
-It's impossible.

02:49.803 --> 02:54.373
The Coalition has no records
of a planet in this sector.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.875
-The planet's naturally
undetectable by sensors,

02:56.877 --> 02:58.210
completely cloaked.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.645
I'm the only one
that knows how to find it.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.814
But this ship will lead them
right to us if you don't help!

03:02.816 --> 03:04.850
In a moment, we'll be
in range for the escape pods

03:04.852 --> 03:05.817
to reach the surface.

03:05.819 --> 03:08.220
After that, destroy the ship!

03:08.222 --> 03:09.721
Tell them all
you found was a wreck

03:09.723 --> 03:11.623
or they'll never
stop looking for us!

03:11.625 --> 03:14.493
They find us, they'll kill us.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.428
What are you doing?

03:16.430 --> 03:20.199
<i> -Long-range connection</i>
<i> established.</i>

03:20.201 --> 03:20.933
-Oh, shut if off!

03:20.935 --> 03:23.402
<i> -Paladin, this is</i>
<i> Coalition Command.</i>

03:23.404 --> 03:25.737
<i> We've got a lock</i>
<i> on this ship's position.</i>

03:25.739 --> 03:28.640
<i> Go ahead and jump out.</i>
<i> We'll take it from here.</i>

03:28.642 --> 03:31.376
-Commander, I'm on board
the stolen vessel.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.612
Permission to negotiate
terms for surrender.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.848
<i> -Negative.</i>
<i> Command advises</i>
<i> immediate evacuation.</i>

03:36.850 --> 03:38.517
<i> -We will destroy</i>
<i> that ship, Paladin.</i>

03:38.519 --> 03:41.253
-No!
<i> -Make sure you're not on it.</i>

03:41.255 --> 03:42.821
- No!

03:43.324 --> 03:45.757
[thud]

03:45.759 --> 03:47.426
-Oh! No!

03:47.428 --> 03:49.528
-What--? What's happening?

03:49.530 --> 03:50.662
-They're blowing the engines.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.598
Didn't even
give us time to evacuate.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.732
I told you!
-No. They won't!

03:53.734 --> 03:56.001
They wouldn't! It's impossible!
Command, come in!

03:56.003 --> 03:57.936
There are innocent people
onboard the vessel!

03:57.938 --> 04:00.973
-Not even you can get a signal
out this close to the planet.

04:00.975 --> 04:02.874
There's no time
to get everyone off.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.409
How many does your ship hold?

04:04.411 --> 04:05.010
-Not enough.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.713
Squire, prepare to initiate the
boarding pod's self-destruct...

04:07.715 --> 04:08.847
-What are you doing?

04:08.849 --> 04:10.649
-Buying you and your
people time to escape.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.252
Get them to the front and
I'll separate the engines!

04:13.254 --> 04:16.321
-Separate...?
-Do it now!

04:16.423 --> 04:17.956
-All personnel, evacuate now!

04:17.958 --> 04:21.360
Drop what you're
doing and go...now!

04:21.362 --> 04:22.561
What about you?

04:22.563 --> 04:23.562
-Don't worry about me.

04:23.564 --> 04:28.500
Squire, prepare to initiate
the self-destruct on my command!

04:28.502 --> 04:29.935
Squire?

04:38.746 --> 04:41.346
<i> -Security override.</i>

06:14.375 --> 06:16.041
[bell dings]

06:26.153 --> 06:29.588
-Better a few years
late than never.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.838
Hello?

06:52.513 --> 06:55.147
-You made it.

06:55.149 --> 06:56.982
-Ajax...

06:56.984 --> 06:58.550
No thanks to you.

06:58.552 --> 07:02.487
-Found that way out
on a frontier planet.

07:02.489 --> 07:03.622
Word's spreading.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.856
You're already getting sloppy.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.626
-What's the point of a haven
if people can't get here?

07:07.628 --> 07:09.661
-What about the Coalition?

07:09.663 --> 07:12.063
-Even if they're
smart enough to decode it,

07:12.065 --> 07:13.832
the coin only gets you here.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.034
To get to Haven, you need me.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.537
-What's it made of?

07:18.839 --> 07:20.505
-That's Haven's little secret.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.741
[scoffs]
-So what?

07:22.743 --> 07:23.675
You're their leader.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.744
-Haven doesn't really
have a leader.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.747
I'm just the guy that
knows how to get there.

07:28.749 --> 07:31.883
[growls]

07:31.885 --> 07:34.052
Hey, buddy.

07:34.054 --> 07:37.956
-2,756 Novaks

07:37.958 --> 07:41.460
perished by these hands

07:41.462 --> 07:46.631
for this Novak to stand
before you today!

07:46.633 --> 07:49.034
[growls]

07:49.036 --> 07:52.003
-No need to sic
your Novak on me, Ajax.

07:52.005 --> 07:56.775
You know, if anything happens
to me, you'll never find Haven.

07:58.879 --> 08:03.014
You got anything
to drink on this wreck?

08:10.224 --> 08:14.192
-Don't you want to know how we
survived after you ditched us?

08:14.194 --> 08:18.597
-Looks like you
survived just fine.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.899
[Novak grunts]

08:26.773 --> 08:32.143
-Okay. Helper, you're...

08:32.145 --> 08:35.179
about to be free.

08:36.917 --> 08:37.749
[chuckles]

08:37.751 --> 08:39.618
Feel any different?

08:41.788 --> 08:44.089
-Excited at the prospect
of leaving the ship

08:44.091 --> 08:45.757
for the first time.

08:45.759 --> 08:49.828
Also the looming potential
for imminent death.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.229
-Yeah.

08:51.865 --> 08:57.102
Helper, I, uh, have to do this.
You don't.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.271
I understand if you want
to stay on the ship.

08:59.273 --> 09:02.107
-Astera, I go wherever you go.

09:02.109 --> 09:05.944
-Do you mean that or is that
just how you're programmed?

09:07.281 --> 09:09.781
-Both.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.091
She would be proud of you now.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.169
-How do I look?

09:31.171 --> 09:34.105
-Like your father's daughter.

09:34.107 --> 09:34.940
[scoffs]
-Okay.

09:34.942 --> 09:39.244
I didn't realize sarcasm was
a part of your programming now.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.254
-Move!

09:50.624 --> 09:52.724
-We have searched every
deep space quadrant

09:52.726 --> 09:56.328
of known Coalition territory
but this one.

09:56.330 --> 09:59.030
Corbryn is out there somewhere.

09:59.032 --> 09:59.898
I know it.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.900
-There's a reason
we haven't searched here.

10:01.902 --> 10:05.737
The sector is barren.
There's nothing here.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.172
And we've been led
astray before.

10:07.174 --> 10:11.943
-I haven't come this far and
this long to merge everything

10:11.945 --> 10:15.747
on the word of
that rogue criminal!

10:17.084 --> 10:18.783
We have other assurances.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.952
We're close.

10:29.229 --> 10:32.163
-Tryn, privacy.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.101
-You sure?

10:36.103 --> 10:37.902
-Yeah, I'm good.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.009
Ran out of ice
a few systems back.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.411
-Most come to Haven
with a lot less.

10:46.413 --> 10:50.181
Sometimes they drift in on
nothing but life support...

10:52.085 --> 10:54.085
some don't make it at all.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.693
Would have been nice

11:01.695 --> 11:04.863
having an industrial class
freighter all these years.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.898
-You did all right without it.

11:06.900 --> 11:10.135
-There'd be a lot more
haven on Haven by now.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.203
-I get it.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.772
-Ajax...

11:14.241 --> 11:15.707
You left thousands to die.

11:15.709 --> 11:21.146
-Because you didn't tell me
there was gonna be a Paladin.

11:21.148 --> 11:22.881
-It was part of the plan.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.283
-You didn't tell me the plan.

11:26.420 --> 11:28.787
-Would you have come if I did?

11:29.289 --> 11:32.857
Look, I just gotta know.

11:32.859 --> 11:38.063
Why are you here now,
after all these years?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.200
How can I trust you?

11:46.373 --> 11:48.873
-You convinced me
to steal this ship.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.376
You said we'd never get caught!
-We didn't.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.312
-And ever since then,
I can't even get an icemaker,

11:54.314 --> 11:57.382
let alone a decent crew
or the much-needed repairs

11:57.384 --> 11:59.184
for this tub of rust!

11:59.186 --> 12:00.719
I'm on the run in a ship

12:00.721 --> 12:03.455
I can't dock on
a single Coalition planet.

12:03.457 --> 12:07.292
And nowadays,
that's every planet!

12:07.294 --> 12:08.093
-Not Haven.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.729
We welcome everyone,
even pirates.

12:10.731 --> 12:13.331
-Don't you call me that!
You do not get to call me that!

12:13.333 --> 12:16.067
You know I started out legit!

12:16.069 --> 12:20.238
And you know
Paladins kill pirates!

12:21.842 --> 12:24.275
How was I supposed
to know he was on our side

12:24.277 --> 12:27.011
if you didn't tell me?

12:31.852 --> 12:36.855
You ask me how can you trust me.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.059
How can I trust you?

12:43.797 --> 12:45.430
-Because...

12:46.833 --> 12:49.300
sounds like
we need each other.

12:53.140 --> 12:56.141
We call this Mana.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.443
There's a lot more
where that came from.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.813
We convert it to everything
from food to star fuel.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.549
But we're limited in
the ways of transporting it,

13:04.551 --> 13:08.987
being as we only have what came
down with us in the escape pods.

13:08.989 --> 13:13.224
But with you here,
with this ship,

13:13.226 --> 13:14.859
we can start expanding.

13:14.861 --> 13:17.395
We set up a supply run,
we get what we need

13:17.397 --> 13:18.496
to finish what we started,

13:18.498 --> 13:21.232
bring more people
to Haven, everything!

13:21.234 --> 13:22.433
We can get back on track!

13:22.435 --> 13:26.471
We can make this planet
what it was supposed to be!

13:27.841 --> 13:30.074
What do you say?

13:31.278 --> 13:32.977
To pirates?

13:39.486 --> 13:41.352
-To pirates.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.190
-All right.

13:45.192 --> 13:48.159
Lucky for us,
Mana in its natural form

13:48.161 --> 13:49.360
emits a sort of radiation.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.930
It's harmless to us, but
it's hell on ship sensors.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.265
One of the first things
we did was to figure out a way

13:54.267 --> 13:58.102
to counteract the disruption
with a frequency code

13:58.104 --> 14:02.207
that only a
few of us knows...

14:07.380 --> 14:09.214
Welcome to Haven.

14:26.933 --> 14:30.368
I'll show you around when
my guys fix up your ship.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.469
Don't worry about the Coalition.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.338
The only way they'd find you
now is with some sort

14:33.340 --> 14:35.340
of two-way signal beacon
strong enough

14:35.342 --> 14:36.641
to get through
the radiation field.

14:36.643 --> 14:39.410
Even then, you know, you come
outta light-speed wrong,

14:39.412 --> 14:42.213
liable to blow us all to hell.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.285
[growls]

14:47.587 --> 14:49.053
-Did you catch all that?

14:49.055 --> 14:51.990
-Is he Haven's leader?
-No.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.959
Just the guy that knows
how to get there.

14:54.961 --> 14:55.627
-We copy.

14:55.629 --> 14:58.296
The Coalition thanks
you, Captain.

14:58.531 --> 15:03.001
-Do you realize
what you've just done?

15:03.003 --> 15:05.003
-Pirate.

15:09.309 --> 15:13.444
-There. Sir, we've
located the pirate.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.145
Shall I--

15:14.147 --> 15:16.347
-I think battle stations,
please.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.683
And see if you can find Astera.

15:18.685 --> 15:22.186
I would like her
to be here for this.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.670
-Your father wants to see
you on the Control Deck.

15:38.672 --> 15:42.106
-I'll be right there.
-No. I'll take you there now.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.208
-Lead the way.

15:47.013 --> 15:49.981
-How far can you
project that thing?

15:49.983 --> 15:50.715
-We'll find out.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.484
-You know, it's an important
day for my father.

15:53.486 --> 15:56.654
-Mm-hmm, and for you, I'm sure.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.691
After all,
your entire life

15:59.693 --> 16:02.260
has been a journey
leading to this place.

16:02.262 --> 16:07.265
I imagine this planet holds
some significance for you...

16:09.002 --> 16:11.202
as it did your mother.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.372
What?

16:14.374 --> 16:15.573
No juvenile pranks this time?

16:15.575 --> 16:20.278
No petty, ineffectual
protest in her honor?

16:20.280 --> 16:23.681
I half expected you'd reroute
the food synthesizers again

16:23.683 --> 16:26.551
or increase
the artificial gravity.

16:26.553 --> 16:30.555
I have to say,
I'm disappointed.

16:31.024 --> 16:34.659
-Then you're gon...
really...love th...

16:36.529 --> 16:38.663
-Where's Astera?

16:50.310 --> 16:52.643
-Sir, I've located
your daughter.

16:52.645 --> 16:56.414
She's onboard an escape pod
headed towards the planet.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.516
-Get up here!

17:08.127 --> 17:09.627
-He knows.

17:09.628 --> 17:10.627
-That's good.

17:10.630 --> 17:14.165
He won't attack if
I'm down there, right?

17:14.166 --> 17:16.701
-I'm ready to address them.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.336
Make sure they can hear me.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.805
Attention, enemies
of the Coalition.

17:20.807 --> 17:26.743
<i> [man] This is Lord Malastor.</i>
<i> You have been lied to.</i>

17:26.746 --> 17:28.746
This planet is no haven.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.783
It's land and resources
are property

17:31.785 --> 17:33.284
of the Coalition of Planets.

17:33.286 --> 17:37.355
<i> There is no corner of the</i>
<i> galaxy that the arms of the</i>
<i> Coalition</i>

17:37.357 --> 17:41.759
<i> cannot reach, and today</i>
<i> I am its hand.</i>

17:42.495 --> 17:45.196
It'll be up to the leaders
among you

17:45.198 --> 17:47.799
to determine whether
this hand remains

17:47.801 --> 17:49.634
open in friendship

17:49.636 --> 17:52.437
or crushes you
in its grasp!

17:52.439 --> 17:55.606
You have 24 hours
to surrender the planet

17:55.608 --> 17:59.177
or suffer the consequences.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.779
Choose wisely.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.351
Establish a blockade.

18:07.353 --> 18:09.720
Not a single ship gets out!

18:09.722 --> 18:11.756
And, Zelus...

18:13.226 --> 18:15.326
Find my daughter.

18:21.801 --> 18:22.834
-What's taking so long?

18:22.836 --> 18:24.268
You get that Mana
cleaned out yet?

18:24.270 --> 18:29.841
-The reward is mighty,
but this Novak is mightier.

18:29.843 --> 18:32.710
There's one crate left.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.346
-Then get it and let's go!

18:42.722 --> 18:46.124
-System log shows Commander
Corbryn should still be onboard.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.725
-Lead the way, and hurry.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.627
-This way!

18:49.629 --> 18:52.830
-Ah, you're turning me in
and you're robbing me?

18:53.333 --> 18:54.799
-You let a pirate
onto your spaceport.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.801
What did you think
was gonna happen?

18:56.803 --> 18:59.871
-I didn't think you'd
clean out my entire supply!

18:59.873 --> 19:04.809
Haven needs that Mana!
The galaxy needs it!

19:04.811 --> 19:06.644
-I didn't want this contract.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.380
I got caught!

19:09.482 --> 19:14.252
It was me or you, and
I'm always gonna pick me.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.487
And I'm always gonna profit.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.790
-Is that what you
tell yourself, Captain?

19:19.792 --> 19:23.261
You think they're gonna
honor some pirate's contract,

19:23.263 --> 19:25.897
you got a nasty surprising
coming to you.

19:25.899 --> 19:26.797
-Captain Ajax!

19:26.799 --> 19:27.899
My father sends his regards,

19:27.901 --> 19:29.400
but he's preoccupied
with the assault.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.768
It's his wish that
you release the prisoner

19:30.770 --> 19:33.538
into my custody for the
completion of your contract.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.640
-And who's your father?

19:35.642 --> 19:36.874
-Lord Malastor, of course.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.509
And on behalf of
the Coalition of Planets,

19:38.511 --> 19:41.212
he'd like to thank you
for a job well done.

19:41.214 --> 19:41.746
-Uh-huh.

19:41.748 --> 19:46.384
-He'd also like to pardon you
for any past transgressions.

19:47.320 --> 19:51.556
-So, Malastor sent
his only daughter

19:51.558 --> 19:55.459
into enemy territory for him.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.295
-You be glad he did.

19:57.297 --> 19:58.829
He might not be so
understanding

19:58.831 --> 20:01.432
over your plundering
Coalition property.

20:01.434 --> 20:05.269
I'm willing to forgive it
for a job well done.

20:05.271 --> 20:06.704
-I'll just call
and confirm.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.272
-I wouldn't.
-I'm gonna.

20:08.274 --> 20:09.740
-Allow me.

20:10.476 --> 20:11.776
Father, forgive me
for interrupting...

20:11.778 --> 20:13.811
<i> [Malastor] I thought I sent</i>
<i> you to retrieve the prisoner.</i>

20:13.813 --> 20:16.447
<i> Was I not clear enough</i>
<i> or can you not handle it?</i>

20:16.449 --> 20:18.950
-I'm aboard the Bounty
with Captain Ajax.

20:18.952 --> 20:20.651
She wishes to confirm
your orders.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.521
<i>[Malastor] I will not be</i>
<i>questioned by a lawless pirate!</i>

20:23.523 --> 20:26.624
<i> Tell this self-serving captain</i>
<i> that she can turn over</i>

20:26.626 --> 20:28.526
<i> Commander Corbryn</i>
<i> or she can die</i>

20:28.528 --> 20:31.329
<i> with the rest of</i>
<i> the criminals.</i>

20:31.331 --> 20:33.631
-Fine.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.868
Get him off my ship then.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.571
He's not worth the trouble.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.710
-Wait!
-Hey!

20:45.712 --> 20:47.812
It's for your own good.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.515
Come on.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.685
-Uh, hi.
I'm Corbryn.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.519
-Astera Malastor.

20:55.521 --> 20:57.455
-Yeah. I know who you are.
Where we going?

20:57.457 --> 20:58.789
-We have to get off this ship.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.958
Launch your fleet!
Activate your defenses!

21:00.960 --> 21:01.759
Fight back?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.294
-Haven doesn't really
have a fleet.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.396
I mean, the people who
come here are refugees,

21:05.398 --> 21:06.497
you know, farmers, smugglers.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.566
Some are ex-Coalition,
but not enough.

21:08.568 --> 21:09.634
Even if we got 'em all to fight,

21:09.636 --> 21:11.269
we'd just be sending
them to their deaths.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.903
-Then what do you have?

21:12.905 --> 21:13.838
-We have a Paladin.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.439
[scoffs]
-All the Paladins are dead.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.508
-He's not.
At least, I don't think he is.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.843
He helped save us
when the Coalition tried

21:18.845 --> 21:20.511
to blow up the ship
that brought us here.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.380
He's been in hyper-sleep
ever since.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.982
-Then why didn't you
wake him up before now?

21:24.984 --> 21:25.850
-We never had to.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.918
And historically, the Order
of the Paladins

21:27.920 --> 21:29.053
are loyal to the Coalition.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.988
-Or you could be handing
my father the planet

21:30.990 --> 21:32.823
if this guy decides
to turn you in!

21:32.825 --> 21:33.858
-He won't. Trust me.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.394
There wouldn't be a Haven
if it wasn't for this guy.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.828
Only reason we didn't wake
him up before now

21:37.830 --> 21:39.697
is because I thought it
would somehow

21:39.699 --> 21:40.665
bring the Coalition here,

21:40.667 --> 21:42.566
which obviously isn't
an issue anymore.

21:42.568 --> 21:45.303
He's our last hope,
you know, sort of a

21:45.305 --> 21:46.904
"break glass in case of"
scenario.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.873
-Okay.
So what's the next step?

21:48.875 --> 21:50.308
-Well, we got to get up to him.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.476
Where's your ship?
-Where's your ship?

21:52.478 --> 21:53.844
-My ship?
It's on this ship.

21:53.846 --> 21:54.812
The pirates have it.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.380
-The pirates
I just saved you from?

21:56.382 --> 22:00.718
-Yeah. Don't worry.
I got a plan.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.320
-We're not leaving?

22:02.322 --> 22:03.487
-Your father will
have established

22:03.489 --> 22:04.555
an orbital blockade by now.

22:04.557 --> 22:07.658
-I got a plan that works
for that too, Pixels.

22:07.994 --> 22:12.496
-Blockade doesn't apply to me,
my ship, or my crew.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.597
My contract's complete.

22:13.599 --> 22:15.032
Let us through and
we'll be on our way.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.100
<i>[woman] Can't do that, Captain.</i>

22:16.102 --> 22:19.570
<i> Lord Malastor</i>
<i> has issued strict orders.</i>

22:19.572 --> 22:20.604
<i> No ships in or out.</i>

22:20.606 --> 22:24.442
-Like hell, I'm getting
stuck on this rock!

22:24.444 --> 22:26.844
Put him on!

22:30.049 --> 22:32.450
<i> [Malastor] You're trying</i>
<i> my patience, pirate!</i>

22:32.452 --> 22:33.918
<i> You're surrounded.</i>
<i> You can't escape.</i>

22:33.920 --> 22:36.887
-Then tell these idiots to
open up and let me through,

22:36.889 --> 22:37.988
and I'll be out of your hair.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.890
<i> -You'll be allowed</i>
<i> through the blockade</i>

22:39.892 --> 22:43.060
<i> once you deliver the rebel</i>
<i> leader per our contract.</i>

22:43.062 --> 22:46.630
-I just turned him over.
Check with your daughter.

22:46.632 --> 22:47.965
<i> -With my...what did you say?</i>

22:47.967 --> 22:50.434
<i> When was this? Where?</i>

22:58.945 --> 23:00.077
-Whoa! What are you doing?

23:00.079 --> 23:01.979
-Gonna blast the doors open.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.748
-No, you're not.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.083
I've got it. Helper?

23:08.988 --> 23:10.054
-Hello.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.922
[grunts]

23:17.397 --> 23:19.897
-What are you doing?
-Well, there's no way

23:19.899 --> 23:22.166
we'll make it past that blockade
with normal thrusters.

23:22.468 --> 23:24.702
Gonna have to jump us
into light-speed.

23:24.704 --> 23:25.836
-Have you done that before?

23:25.838 --> 23:28.172
-Never from inside
a cargo freighter.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.908
Strap in.
-To what?

23:36.149 --> 23:39.083
<i> [Malastor] Answer me, Ajax!</i>
<i> What's going on?</i>

23:39.085 --> 23:41.819
<i> What happened? Come in!</i>

23:50.963 --> 23:53.497
-The cowards fled!

23:53.499 --> 23:55.933
-Take some ships
and find them!

23:55.935 --> 23:57.568
And send some to Haven.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.136
-What happened?

23:59.138 --> 24:01.105
-We've lost contact
with the blockade.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.607
And we're no longer receiving
signal from the Bounty.

24:03.609 --> 24:07.077
-Delay the assault until
my daughter's been found!

24:07.880 --> 24:09.847
-Hey, Helper.

24:11.017 --> 24:12.082
-You okay?

24:12.084 --> 24:14.084
-You need more seatbelts.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.455
Where are we?

24:17.457 --> 24:19.523
-The Past.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.995
-Think you can get over there?

24:33.105 --> 24:36.040
Helper?
Did you get there?

24:36.042 --> 24:37.041
<i> [Helper] I'm inside.</i>

24:37.043 --> 24:41.145
-Okay, great.
I'll dock us.

24:52.091 --> 24:52.957
-Is that him?

24:52.959 --> 24:55.793
[Corbryn] Yeah, that's him.

25:06.906 --> 25:08.606
-Have you been here before?

25:08.608 --> 25:11.208
-Only once to make
sure he wasn't dead.

25:12.078 --> 25:15.045
Planet's distortion field
must have scrambled his ship.

25:15.047 --> 25:18.616
If I use a certain frequency...

25:25.892 --> 25:29.059
-It seems we're receiving
a new code,

25:29.061 --> 25:31.595
an old Coalition code.

25:31.597 --> 25:34.064
Someone's talking to us.

25:34.066 --> 25:36.000
-Who?

25:36.002 --> 25:37.902
<i> [Astera] What's it say?</i>

25:37.904 --> 25:40.137
-Peace before order.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.180
[coughing]

25:58.891 --> 26:00.624
What's wrong with him?

26:00.626 --> 26:03.961
[groaning]

26:08.000 --> 26:09.300
-Don't touch anything.

26:09.302 --> 26:11.001
<i> [man] We found him.</i>

26:11.003 --> 26:14.004
<i> [woman] Take him out.</i>

26:18.044 --> 26:19.276
-This could actually work.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.912
-Yeah. Let's just hope
he's on our side.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.715
Go see what you can find out.

26:39.632 --> 26:40.598
Hi. I'm Astera Mala...

26:40.600 --> 26:45.002
-Astera Malastor,
daughter of Lord Malastor.

26:45.004 --> 26:45.803
Greetings.

26:45.805 --> 26:50.007
I am Denz Atreus, Paladin
of star-sector Epsilon 27.

26:50.009 --> 26:55.079
And you are Commander...
Commander Corbryn.

26:56.048 --> 26:56.981
You made it.

26:56.983 --> 27:00.150
-Yeah.
-Step back.

27:01.754 --> 27:05.255
The Commander is a good man,
if a little misguided.

27:05.257 --> 27:08.792
Although admittedly,
I've only known him briefly.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.095
I will ensure that
he is treated fairly.

27:11.097 --> 27:13.097
I've synced
with Coalition Command.

27:13.099 --> 27:16.200
Rest assured, you will be
with your father in a moment

27:16.202 --> 27:19.837
and we can finally settle
this matter once and for all.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.839
-No. You don't understand.

27:21.841 --> 27:24.041
There's gonna be a war.

27:25.111 --> 27:26.410
Whoa!
-Hey!

27:26.412 --> 27:27.878
-Hey, stop!
What are you doing?

27:27.880 --> 27:31.348
-The path to order lies
only through peace.

27:31.350 --> 27:32.883
Once I've delivered Corbryn,

27:32.885 --> 27:34.685
negotiations for
surrender may begin.

27:34.687 --> 27:38.222
-There's not gonna be peace.
My father doesn't negotiate.

27:38.224 --> 27:39.990
-Denz, if you turn me in,
I'm dead.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.292
-If you don't get us
to the surface right now,

27:42.294 --> 27:43.227
people are going to die.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.729
-No harm will befall
either of you

27:45.731 --> 27:47.164
while you're
under my protection!

27:47.166 --> 27:49.700
The same goes for the planet!

27:49.702 --> 27:51.235
I give you my word.

27:51.237 --> 27:56.373
You have nothing to fear from
the Coalition of the Planets.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.309
-Helper! Now!

27:59.812 --> 28:02.846
-Helper! Ready an escape pod.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.949
-That was ill-advised.

28:11.724 --> 28:15.893
-Sir, we're being hailed
in an old Coalition frequency,

28:15.895 --> 28:18.796
vessel designation "Honor".

28:18.798 --> 28:21.131
It's a Paladin.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.935
-So it's true.

28:24.937 --> 28:28.806
He's still alive
after all this time.

28:28.808 --> 28:32.810
I thought you dealt
with the last of them.

28:33.746 --> 28:35.345
-So did I.

28:35.414 --> 28:39.850
-Let's hope his
loyalties are in order.

28:44.490 --> 28:48.058
-See? I told you.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.993
Peace was never an option.

28:49.995 --> 28:53.297
What Haven needs
right now is a protector.

28:53.299 --> 28:54.364
-Haven...

28:54.366 --> 28:56.033
<i> [Malastor] Paladin,</i>
<i> the Coalition of Planets</i>

28:56.035 --> 28:57.968
<i> thanks you for your</i>
<i> intervention.</i>

28:57.970 --> 28:59.336
<i> And I'm personally</i>
<i> in your debt for</i>

28:59.338 --> 29:00.971
<i> the safe recovery</i>
<i> of my daughter.</i>

29:00.973 --> 29:02.806
<i> I trust she hasn't given</i>
<i> you too much trouble?</i>

29:02.808 --> 29:06.143
<i> Where is the rebel leader?</i>
-Somewhere you can't get him!

29:06.145 --> 29:08.245
<i> [Malastor] Astera,</i>
<i> nothing would please me more</i>

29:08.247 --> 29:12.116
<i> than to resolve this conflict</i>
<i> without bloodshed,</i>

29:12.118 --> 29:13.784
Disable their
light-speed engines.

29:13.786 --> 29:16.887
I don't want them running now
that Astera's this close.

29:16.889 --> 29:20.824
It seems that surrender
is off the table for now.

29:20.826 --> 29:23.427
Begin the assault!

29:23.829 --> 29:25.129
Let's see if they
change their minds.

29:25.131 --> 29:27.898
-It will be my honor
to lead the attack, sir.

29:27.900 --> 29:28.766
-No, it won't.

29:28.768 --> 29:32.836
I need someone that I trust
to retrieve Astera for me.

29:32.838 --> 29:34.905
-What about the Paladin?

29:34.907 --> 29:37.441
-Do what you normally
do when you find one.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.476
Just bring her back!

29:41.013 --> 29:42.946
Continue the attack!

29:44.283 --> 29:45.482
-No! Do something!

29:45.484 --> 29:46.817
-They've disabled the controls!

29:46.819 --> 29:49.920
-Then go back!
Didn't I just see you fly?

29:49.922 --> 29:50.521
-In zero-g, yes!

29:50.523 --> 29:54.491
This is low orbit where
I have gravity to contend with!

29:54.960 --> 29:58.462
-It's okay, Helper.
You can come out now.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.367
Think you can get over
to that warship?

30:03.369 --> 30:05.135
-I can try.

30:05.137 --> 30:08.472
-That I have not seen yet.

30:08.474 --> 30:09.907
Is that thing real?

30:09.909 --> 30:10.941
-She is to me.

30:10.943 --> 30:15.445
-Attention, Honor.
You are ordered to surrender.

30:15.447 --> 30:16.313
Lord Malastor...

30:16.315 --> 30:18.315
I've reached the Paladin ship.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.850
They're not responding.

30:19.852 --> 30:21.385
-Then wait.

30:24.256 --> 30:27.524
-Think out who you help.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.227
-What?

30:30.229 --> 30:31.962
-It worked. We have to leave.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.897
-Wait! Stop!
Where are you going?

30:33.899 --> 30:35.232
We have to help!
-Look, it's all blown up!

30:35.234 --> 30:38.368
If we don't retreat now, battle
is over before it even begins!

30:38.370 --> 30:41.505
Hang on, I'm going to
jump up to lightspeed.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.042
[growls]

30:45.044 --> 30:47.444
[Malastor] Zelus,
what was that? What happened?

30:47.446 --> 30:51.148
<i> Do you have Astera? Zelus?</i>

30:52.585 --> 30:54.551
[explosion]

30:54.553 --> 30:55.919
-He shot me!

30:55.921 --> 30:57.955
-Squire, I need a map
of the region

30:57.957 --> 31:00.190
and a waypoint for
the nearest rebel outpost.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.559
First imperative is
to secure Corbryn

31:02.561 --> 31:04.628
and aid in the planet's defense!

31:04.630 --> 31:06.363
Are you all right?

31:06.365 --> 31:07.331
-Yes.

31:07.333 --> 31:11.501
I mean, no, but, yeah.

31:11.503 --> 31:14.404
I can't believe he just shot me.

31:14.406 --> 31:15.572
-He shot my ship!

31:15.574 --> 31:18.041
-Will it be all right?
How bad is it?

31:18.043 --> 31:20.611
-Oh, she'll fly, but
the repairs will take time,

31:20.613 --> 31:23.247
time we don't have
if we want to reach Corbryn

31:23.249 --> 31:24.982
before the Coalition does!

31:24.984 --> 31:28.085
-Lucky for you, we have help.

31:29.355 --> 31:30.954
-The ship is sophisticated,

31:30.956 --> 31:34.291
though the technology
is quite antiquated.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.493
I'm certain I can
manage the repairs.

31:36.495 --> 31:39.129
-Can this thing be trusted?

31:39.999 --> 31:41.632
-This thing's name is Helper.

31:41.634 --> 31:43.967
-Short for "Hard Light
Projected Retainer",

31:43.969 --> 31:48.305
though I've come to find
that label somewhat derivative.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.540
-She's the only person I trust.

31:50.542 --> 31:54.544
-All right. Then I'll
leave Honor in your hands.

31:54.546 --> 31:57.214
Excuse my ignorance, Helper.

31:57.216 --> 31:58.982
-Happy to be of service.

31:58.984 --> 32:01.285
-Helper, I'm gonna
have to leave you alone

32:01.287 --> 32:03.420
on the ship for a while.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.189
-You'll be back.

32:18.237 --> 32:21.672
<i> [Ajax] Listen up down there:</i>
<i> find him.</i>

32:21.674 --> 32:26.209
<i> And bring him to me.</i>

32:30.716 --> 32:33.350
-There's something here.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.519
-Go check it out.

32:44.997 --> 32:49.032
-Come on, Ajax.
You can do better than that.

32:49.034 --> 32:51.435
You won't be needing
this anymore.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.471
Where is your ship?

32:55.174 --> 32:58.475
<i> [Ajax] You find him yet?</i>

32:58.477 --> 32:59.309
-Nice try, Ajax,

32:59.311 --> 33:02.646
but I think you'll find
you're down a couple pirates.

33:07.486 --> 33:08.552
-I told you, sir!

33:08.554 --> 33:10.187
Somehow the Paladin made
the jump to light-speed!

33:10.189 --> 33:13.056
I tried to disable the engines
before they made the jump.

33:13.058 --> 33:15.158
-You'd better hope
that's all you did.

33:15.160 --> 33:18.328
-With all due respect,
Lord Malastor,

33:18.330 --> 33:20.731
your daughter has clearly
chosen her side.

33:20.733 --> 33:23.100
-I will not hear another word!

33:23.102 --> 33:27.004
None of that! Not again.
Not from you.

33:27.006 --> 33:30.073
Get out of my sight and
don't you dare step foot

33:30.075 --> 33:33.543
on this deck again
until you've found her.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.456
[Zelus shouts]

33:46.458 --> 33:49.593
-We shouldn't be
too far off now.

33:49.595 --> 33:50.427
-It's funny.

33:50.429 --> 33:54.031
Before today, I've only been off
the warship a handful of times.

33:54.033 --> 33:55.132
We're Haven's only hope,

33:55.134 --> 33:58.435
and neither of us stepped foot
on the planet until now.

33:58.704 --> 34:01.505
-That's the very nature
of my order.

34:01.507 --> 34:04.274
-Then why answer
to the Coalition?

34:04.276 --> 34:06.410
-My order
predates the Coalition

34:06.412 --> 34:08.378
by a great many cycles.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.347
There was a time
when their values

34:10.349 --> 34:12.248
were in line with our own.

34:12.251 --> 34:16.186
We helped them grow,
we worked together.

34:16.188 --> 34:20.757
It pains me now to see them
act with such hostility.

34:20.759 --> 34:23.493
-My dad thinks
what he's doing is right.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.429
-There is hope
for your father yet.

34:25.431 --> 34:28.665
-How?
After what he just did?

34:28.667 --> 34:30.801
-Well, it's like you said.

34:30.803 --> 34:33.103
Your father believes
he is right.

34:33.105 --> 34:35.338
It may be up to
us to provide him

34:35.340 --> 34:37.507
with the necessary perspective.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.610
-Denz! It's Zelus!

34:40.612 --> 34:42.612
He's going for the outpost!

34:42.614 --> 34:43.612
-We need to find cover.

34:43.614 --> 34:45.348
-Denz, if he gets to
the outpost and blows it up

34:45.350 --> 34:46.349
before we find Corbryn,

34:46.351 --> 34:48.819
we're never gonna make it
before the deadline.

34:48.821 --> 34:50.387
-He won't.

34:50.389 --> 34:52.489
Run!

34:53.292 --> 34:57.394
Astera, get to cover now!
Get to the base!

35:02.367 --> 35:06.470
Everybody out!
Leave...now!

35:06.472 --> 35:10.173
I said go!
It's your only chance!

35:10.175 --> 35:12.242
I'm not...

35:12.411 --> 35:13.343
This is Astera Malastor.

35:13.345 --> 35:15.879
Tell my father to lock down
on my position.

35:15.881 --> 35:18.448
I found the rebels!

35:27.793 --> 35:31.628
Okay, Corbryn, where am I going?

35:32.231 --> 35:34.264
Where am I going?

35:36.401 --> 35:38.301
There!

35:43.208 --> 35:44.774
-Hey! Hey!

35:44.776 --> 35:48.278
Hey, wait!
Wait for me!

35:48.280 --> 35:51.181
Hey! Hey!

35:51.183 --> 35:53.483
Wait for me!

36:00.392 --> 36:01.324
You gotta be kidding me.

36:01.326 --> 36:07.297
<i> [Ajax] Hey, buddy, you think</i>
<i> we'd forget you?</i>

36:33.292 --> 36:35.926
-That is Paladin technology.

36:35.928 --> 36:39.829
Tell me, friend,
how did you acquire it?

36:39.831 --> 36:41.765
-From a Paladin, friend.

36:41.767 --> 36:44.634
-Paladins serve for life.

36:46.338 --> 36:47.871
-This one did.

36:48.273 --> 36:50.640
The order you serve
is no longer.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.809
I made sure of that myself.

36:52.811 --> 36:55.412
-My brothers...why?

36:55.414 --> 36:59.482
-There is only the Coalition
and its enemies.

36:59.484 --> 37:01.851
Lord Malastor offers
you one last chance

37:01.853 --> 37:03.587
to prove your loyalty.

37:03.589 --> 37:05.956
-My order stands
as long as I do.

37:05.958 --> 37:07.324
I decline!

37:07.326 --> 37:09.459
-I was hoping you'd say that.

37:09.461 --> 37:12.829
Hand over the girl
and surrender the outpost!

37:12.831 --> 37:15.398
-I'm here, Zelus.
I'm right here.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.401
-Astera?
Good to see you.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.303
I offer you the same terms.

37:20.305 --> 37:25.475
Come with me or suffer
the consequences of treason!

37:25.477 --> 37:28.278
I'm sure you remember
what those are.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.012
-He's not gonna kill me.

37:29.014 --> 37:31.281
He does whatever
my father tells him to.

37:31.283 --> 37:34.517
Isn't that right, Zelus?

37:34.519 --> 37:35.619
-True.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.821
I've traveled
to every scum-ridden corner

37:37.823 --> 37:40.290
of this galaxy with your father.

37:40.292 --> 37:42.292
He's a good man,

37:42.294 --> 37:44.694
a true leader...

37:45.364 --> 37:48.531
but he's grown soft and weak.

37:49.301 --> 37:50.900
Do you know why?

37:50.902 --> 37:55.672
It's because of you and
your traitor of a mother!

37:56.842 --> 37:58.775
-You can't kill me.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.978
-I'm sure your father
will understand.

38:01.980 --> 38:04.514
After all, I had no choice,

38:04.516 --> 38:07.717
overcome with grief
after witnessing

38:07.719 --> 38:10.654
the murder of his only daughter.

38:10.656 --> 38:14.991
I had to strike down
the Paladin responsible.

38:17.863 --> 38:20.697
Say hello to your brothers!

38:25.470 --> 38:27.003
[grunts]

38:46.892 --> 38:49.993
-Helper! Now!

38:50.529 --> 38:54.464
[Zelus shouting]

39:06.011 --> 39:07.377
-Get us out of here!

39:07.379 --> 39:08.078
-Where to?

39:08.080 --> 39:11.981
-I found coordinates
for the rebel base,
inputting now!

39:11.983 --> 39:13.350
Helper?

39:13.352 --> 39:13.950
-Setting course.

39:13.952 --> 39:16.953
<i> [male voice]</i>
<i> Coordinates accepted.</i>

39:19.658 --> 39:22.992
-Denz, I'm so sorry.

39:24.396 --> 39:27.497
-All of them...dead.

39:28.133 --> 39:29.899
-I know.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.635
I didn't know how to tell you.

39:35.073 --> 39:38.508
-I will avenge you,
my brothers.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.944
I swear this.

39:48.787 --> 39:50.053
-Nice shooting back there.

39:50.055 --> 39:52.555
-I had ample time
to learn Honor's subsystems.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.657
She's a wonderful ship.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.627
-I'm kind of worried about him.

39:58.463 --> 40:01.965
-Look who we found.

40:01.967 --> 40:03.700
-Should I shoot them too?

40:03.702 --> 40:05.001
-I wouldn't, if I were you!

40:05.003 --> 40:07.670
<i> [Corbryn] Ajax!</i>
<i> You let me out of here!</i>

40:07.672 --> 40:08.538
-Pirates!

40:08.540 --> 40:12.675
-Come on in.
Let's have a chat.

40:13.512 --> 40:17.747
-She's not gonna kill him.
My father wants him alive.

40:17.749 --> 40:20.683
This is must be
one of her tricks.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.018
She must want something.

40:22.020 --> 40:25.889
-I would caution you not
to trust these brigands!

40:25.891 --> 40:27.524
They have no honor.

40:27.526 --> 40:28.892
-I don't know.

40:28.894 --> 40:31.761
I mean, you're right,
they're pirates.

40:31.763 --> 40:34.631
But maybe we can
convince them to help.

40:34.633 --> 40:36.132
-Unlikely.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.902
Maintain a safe
following distance.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.437
I will retrieve Corbryn.

40:40.439 --> 40:41.037
-Denz, wait!

40:41.039 --> 40:43.940
You're gonna have to think
outside the box on this one.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.742
They've got the only thing close

40:45.744 --> 40:48.044
to a functioning fleet
on this planet.

40:48.046 --> 40:50.580
Maybe we don't blow it up.

40:53.084 --> 40:54.818
Maybe we need 'em.

40:54.820 --> 40:57.120
We have to at least try.

40:57.222 --> 41:00.590
We have to get to them.

41:06.731 --> 41:08.932
Where are you taking Corbryn?

41:09.201 --> 41:13.536
-Oh, he'll stay someplace
near, but far enough.

41:15.006 --> 41:16.773
In case you try anything,

41:16.775 --> 41:19.075
he goes boom...

41:19.077 --> 41:20.877
along with your fancy ship.

41:20.879 --> 41:24.113
-That man is under
my protection.

41:24.649 --> 41:30.119
-Well, you've done a fine
job so far, haven't you?

41:32.090 --> 41:33.089
You gonna call your dad?

41:33.091 --> 41:35.925
-What's it gonna take
for you to let him go?

41:35.927 --> 41:36.726
-Let him go?

41:36.728 --> 41:41.030
He's my ticket out of
this mess just like you are!

41:42.067 --> 41:44.133
You, I don't really care about.

41:44.135 --> 41:45.602
-You will!

41:45.604 --> 41:46.069
[growls]

41:46.071 --> 41:49.739
-Denz...so we both know you're
not gonna press that then.

41:50.509 --> 41:52.108
-Oh, I'm plenty tempted,

41:52.110 --> 41:55.879
but right now he's
my insurance policy for you.

41:55.881 --> 41:59.816
And you're my insurance
policy for them.

42:00.051 --> 42:01.284
If it came down to it,

42:01.286 --> 42:06.656
I'm sure your dad would
appreciate my judgment here.

42:07.659 --> 42:10.260
-Listen, I know
I lied to you before.

42:10.262 --> 42:13.029
But you have to believe me now
when I tell you that

42:13.031 --> 42:15.031
if you give my dad
what he wants,

42:15.033 --> 42:17.233
your next stop
is Coalition Brig.

42:17.235 --> 42:17.901
[scoffs]

42:17.903 --> 42:20.670
-That's if he lets you
off Haven at all!

42:22.908 --> 42:25.275
-I have the rebel leader,

42:25.277 --> 42:29.879
thus fulfilling
my contract twice!

42:29.881 --> 42:36.085
I have Lord Malastor's daughter
and her gallant protector!

42:38.290 --> 42:41.257
Hey, you forget already?

42:41.259 --> 42:41.925
-Denz...

42:41.927 --> 42:45.061
-I will not be held
hostage by cowards!

42:45.063 --> 42:51.668
-This Novak does
not fear death!

42:52.904 --> 42:55.605
-You may hide behind
that button of yours.

42:55.607 --> 42:59.642
You may even press it,
but if you survive the blast,

42:59.644 --> 43:04.113
you will have me to contend
with until the end of your days.

43:04.115 --> 43:06.716
-I'm shaking.

43:08.019 --> 43:11.220
-Denz, please!

43:13.825 --> 43:16.993
I know we don't have anything
to negotiate with.

43:16.995 --> 43:19.329
But I'm telling you,

43:19.331 --> 43:22.865
my father's not
just gonna let you go free.

43:25.337 --> 43:28.671
The only way out of
this is to fight.

43:40.619 --> 43:42.085
-This is ill-advised.

43:42.087 --> 43:43.653
Why play the pirate's game
and wait

43:43.655 --> 43:46.823
while our enemies draw near
when I can easily dismantle

43:46.825 --> 43:47.857
this scrap heap of a ship?

43:47.859 --> 43:50.226
-Yeah.
Let's call that Plan B, okay?

43:50.228 --> 43:53.229
Like it or not, she has
the upper hand right now.

43:53.231 --> 43:56.232
We can't lose Corbryn
and we can't lose Honor.

43:56.234 --> 44:01.304
So I guess we just have to
wait until she comes around.

44:02.407 --> 44:04.307
Until then...

44:06.978 --> 44:10.947
See if you can get to Corbryn
and take care of that bomb.

44:10.949 --> 44:13.783
Then you can bust us
out of here.

44:23.228 --> 44:27.096
-Hello? Is someone there?

44:27.098 --> 44:29.699
Oh, Helper!
Is it just you?

44:29.701 --> 44:30.199
-Yes.

44:30.201 --> 44:31.434
Explosion device.
I think I can...

44:31.436 --> 44:33.336
-Don't touch it!
-But maybe if I just...

44:33.338 --> 44:34.337
-No, no, no, Helper!

44:34.339 --> 44:35.972
Let me tell you something
about pirates.

44:35.974 --> 44:39.275
You can't trust 'em and they're
wiring's slap-dash at best!

44:39.277 --> 44:42.078
Just don't touch it.

44:43.415 --> 44:44.947
-Okay, com's open.

44:44.949 --> 44:48.251
-This is Captain Ajax
of the frigate Bounty

44:48.253 --> 44:49.952
hailing Lord Malastor.

44:49.954 --> 44:54.057
-I didn't expect to hear
from you again, Captain.

44:54.059 --> 44:56.726
You'd better have something
to report to me.

44:56.728 --> 44:59.095
-I've captured
the rebel leader.

44:59.097 --> 45:04.300
-Ah, it's about time you
made good on our contract.

45:04.302 --> 45:07.403
-And I have your daughter.

45:08.306 --> 45:10.006
-Not bad for a pirate.

45:10.008 --> 45:13.943
I don't say this often,
but I'm impressed.

45:13.945 --> 45:17.346
Bring them both to me and
you could be on your way.

45:17.348 --> 45:18.948
What about the Paladin?

45:18.950 --> 45:22.351
-What about him?
He's here, too.

45:22.854 --> 45:25.021
-Good. Kill him.

45:25.957 --> 45:28.424
Oh, I don't suspect
that he would

45:28.426 --> 45:29.759
align his considerable might

45:29.761 --> 45:31.894
with the interest
of the Coalition again.

45:31.896 --> 45:34.263
Better to remove him
from the board.

45:34.265 --> 45:36.432
Let him join his brothers!

45:36.434 --> 45:38.968
-What's in it for me?

45:40.271 --> 45:41.104
-Excuse me?

45:41.106 --> 45:46.209
-Our contract was for Corbryn
and the location of Haven.

45:46.211 --> 45:47.510
I delivered both.

45:47.512 --> 45:48.745
Everything after that,

45:48.747 --> 45:52.281
including rescuing
your daughter, is bonus.

45:52.283 --> 45:55.351
<i> And this? Not my business.</i>

45:55.353 --> 45:57.520
I'm not your hired killer.

45:57.522 --> 45:58.888
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

45:58.890 --> 46:01.124
You're a pirate
that is lucky

46:01.126 --> 46:03.459
she's proven herself
useful thus far.

46:03.461 --> 46:09.065
For your own good,
I suggest you continue to do so!

46:10.235 --> 46:12.301
Wait for me there!

46:21.179 --> 46:24.480
-All right, let's talk...
alone.

46:24.482 --> 46:28.851
-Now I warned you...
-Yeah, yeah, I'm warned.

46:30.955 --> 46:33.055
You coming?

46:45.270 --> 46:47.904
-I think I've known your dad
for long enough now

46:47.906 --> 46:50.439
to get why you're
willing to go rebel.

46:50.441 --> 46:54.911
What I don't get is
how you think you can win.

46:54.913 --> 46:57.814
-Because we have to
or people will die.

46:57.816 --> 47:00.249
-Yeah, but what's
your stake in it?

47:00.251 --> 47:03.386
Coalition's been taking
exactly everything it wants

47:03.388 --> 47:07.089
since cycles before
either of us were born.

47:07.091 --> 47:08.591
I'm here because
I didn't have an option.

47:08.593 --> 47:12.595
Why are you willing to go
to war with your own family

47:12.597 --> 47:14.964
over a planet
you've never been to?

47:14.966 --> 47:17.166
-Because I didn't have
a choice either.

47:17.168 --> 47:19.068
I've known about
Haven my entire life.

47:19.070 --> 47:21.404
Now that I'm here,
I can't just stand by

47:21.406 --> 47:23.973
and watch my father destroy it.

47:24.475 --> 47:26.108
Neither should you.

47:26.110 --> 47:28.477
-And I'm supposed to do what?

47:33.084 --> 47:35.618
-Ajax, you have a crew,
you have a ship.

47:35.620 --> 47:39.889
You can make a difference if
you decide to work with us.

47:39.891 --> 47:41.023
-Truth is, I don't care.

47:41.025 --> 47:43.626
I was just trying to get
you away from the Paladin.

47:43.628 --> 47:44.861
We're leaving.

47:44.863 --> 47:45.895
-No! We can't leave!

47:45.897 --> 47:47.897
Thousands will die if
we don't do something!

47:47.899 --> 47:51.300
-I am doing something!
Hurry up!

47:55.006 --> 47:56.539
-Denz.

48:01.880 --> 48:03.012
-Hello?

48:03.014 --> 48:05.481
What's going on?
Helper, is that you?

48:06.184 --> 48:09.285
I can hear you.

48:12.924 --> 48:15.291
-You're in my seat!

48:15.360 --> 48:17.560
-They're going to find
you, you know.

48:17.562 --> 48:19.462
-Quiet, princess.

48:20.265 --> 48:22.298
-Plan B! Plan B!

48:22.300 --> 48:24.300
-Thank you, Helper.

48:28.006 --> 48:30.072
-This way!

48:32.176 --> 48:33.309
-Two of you with me!

48:33.311 --> 48:38.547
The rest of you,
kill the Paladin.

48:42.153 --> 48:43.953
-Where are they taking them?

48:43.955 --> 48:45.321
-She's running away.

48:45.323 --> 48:48.124
You go. I'll find her.

48:51.329 --> 48:53.529
-Do not fire that weapon!

49:06.644 --> 49:09.378
-Do you yield?

49:09.380 --> 49:12.348
-2,756 Novaks

49:12.350 --> 49:14.083
perished by these hands

49:14.085 --> 49:19.555
for this Novak to
stand before you today!

49:19.557 --> 49:24.260
This Novak does not yield!

49:25.296 --> 49:27.196
-Very well, then.

49:28.566 --> 49:31.200
Ready when you are.

49:32.170 --> 49:34.136
[growls]

49:47.652 --> 49:50.152
-Pardon my reach.

50:07.238 --> 50:09.138
What do I do with this?

50:09.140 --> 50:11.340
-Don't touch it!

50:11.342 --> 50:14.410
-I'm sure I can find Haven
without you.

50:14.412 --> 50:16.112
-Good luck!

50:34.699 --> 50:36.565
-We have to go back!

50:37.668 --> 50:38.534
-Back? To what?

50:38.536 --> 50:41.270
A blast like that's gonna bring
the Coalition in no time.

50:41.272 --> 50:42.538
We have to be gone before then.

50:42.540 --> 50:44.640
-He could still be alive!
-Then he can find us!

50:44.642 --> 50:47.777
It's too risky and
not when your dad needs us

50:47.779 --> 50:48.711
both to win the war.

50:48.713 --> 50:50.312
-Denz could still be alive.

50:50.314 --> 50:53.682
-It's too risky!
I'm sorry.

50:57.422 --> 50:59.488
[alarm sounding]

51:19.844 --> 51:21.744
-I cleared the Bounty.
This is what's left.

51:21.746 --> 51:25.714
The pirate wasn't lying.
They were definitely here.

51:25.716 --> 51:27.383
-I see.

51:27.385 --> 51:28.384
Where are they now?

51:28.386 --> 51:30.219
-We're still
searching the wreckage,

51:30.221 --> 51:33.322
but the hold was filled
with crates full of this.

51:33.324 --> 51:36.859
They're planning on
making a run with it.

51:36.861 --> 51:38.461
-What is it?

51:38.463 --> 51:39.261
-It's a battery.

51:39.263 --> 51:41.197
The power source
is something non-cataloged.

51:41.199 --> 51:43.399
Can't get a reading on it,
but whatever it is,

51:43.401 --> 51:48.270
the radiation matches the blast
scoring we found on the Bounty.

51:48.673 --> 51:50.773
-A weapon! Well, then...

51:50.775 --> 51:53.242
Each one of you is guilty
of high crimes

51:53.244 --> 51:55.744
against the Coalition
of the Planets,

51:55.746 --> 51:58.347
rendering your lives forfeit

51:58.349 --> 52:03.519
unless one of you should
choose to do the right thing

52:03.521 --> 52:07.323
and aid us in the war effort.

52:07.892 --> 52:13.596
-If not for your Coalition,
this Novak would not exist!

52:13.598 --> 52:17.566
His guilt is your own.

52:17.568 --> 52:20.269
He will die silently

52:20.271 --> 52:21.904
before he forfeits his knowledge

52:21.906 --> 52:25.274
to such feeble men as you!

52:26.544 --> 52:30.312
I demand trial by combat!

52:31.315 --> 52:33.883
Name this one your champion

52:33.885 --> 52:38.554
so I may bring an end
to his days.

52:39.657 --> 52:45.227
-A Novak, a clone
bred for battle,

52:45.229 --> 52:47.296
discontinued line.

52:47.298 --> 52:48.797
He's no threat.

52:48.799 --> 52:53.869
-How many Novaks
have you killed?

52:53.871 --> 52:56.505
-None...yet.

52:56.507 --> 53:00.809
-Then release me and try!

53:03.881 --> 53:05.548
-I don't see your captain,

53:05.550 --> 53:10.486
so I'll assume
she's dead or fled.

53:10.488 --> 53:13.255
And that you are in charge now.

53:13.257 --> 53:17.393
-Novaks don't command.
They only follow.

53:17.395 --> 53:21.664
If she's alive, then
he's still under her command.

53:21.666 --> 53:22.898
-What are the orders, then?

53:22.900 --> 53:26.468
Where is your captain
and the rebel leader?

53:26.470 --> 53:28.871
Where is my daughter?

53:29.707 --> 53:32.841
They were seen with
a man named Denz.

53:32.843 --> 53:34.310
Perhaps you've seen him,

53:34.312 --> 53:38.847
a Paladin, like one Novak,
but as strong as 100 Novaks!

53:38.849 --> 53:42.218
He would make more
than a worthy opponent.

53:42.220 --> 53:46.288
-No such Novak exists!

53:46.290 --> 53:47.323
[growls]

53:47.325 --> 53:49.892
-Was he the one that
destroyed your ship?

53:49.894 --> 53:50.559
[growls]

53:50.561 --> 53:53.529
Did he have my daughter
with him?

53:57.902 --> 53:59.668
[gunshot]

54:00.471 --> 54:04.340
-That is one you are owed!

54:05.376 --> 54:06.709
[chuckles]

54:06.711 --> 54:09.778
-You're in no position
to make demands, clone!

54:09.780 --> 54:12.648
What you owe me has fled
this ship,

54:12.650 --> 54:14.483
which puts the fate

54:14.485 --> 54:19.255
in your remaining crew
in your hands, Captain!

54:19.257 --> 54:22.024
I suggest you consider
how best to be an asset

54:22.026 --> 54:25.828
to the Coalition in
the upcoming battle.

54:26.764 --> 54:29.932
Have them taken to the Brig
and search the wreckage.

54:29.934 --> 54:32.601
Commandeer every last
remaining ship.

54:32.603 --> 54:35.838
I want to make
certain, absolutely certain,

54:35.840 --> 54:41.744
that Astera has not
swayed Ajax's loyalties.

54:42.046 --> 54:43.646
No more tricks.

54:43.648 --> 54:45.948
Just find them.

54:51.489 --> 54:52.955
-Move it!

54:55.960 --> 54:57.960
Clean him up.

55:09.807 --> 55:12.341
-What do we do
about the Captain?

55:12.343 --> 55:13.442
-Leave her.

55:13.444 --> 55:15.878
She's not Captain
of anything now.

55:30.695 --> 55:33.529
How does all this
still have power?

55:33.531 --> 55:36.465
-I have to show you something.

55:53.050 --> 55:55.551
We think the planet
formed around it.

55:55.553 --> 55:58.120
But it's impossible to get
an accurate date.

55:58.122 --> 56:01.023
What we do know is
that this is the source

56:01.025 --> 56:04.693
of everything that
makes Haven a haven.

56:04.695 --> 56:11.567
The Mana, the distortion effect,
the cloaking field, everything.

56:12.370 --> 56:14.670
We can't let
the Coalition find it.

56:14.672 --> 56:17.072
It's limitless
resource and power.

56:17.074 --> 56:20.909
No one would ever be able
to stand up to them again.

56:20.911 --> 56:22.044
If they don't take it,

56:22.046 --> 56:25.914
they'll destroy it,
Haven along with it.

56:35.726 --> 56:39.528
-Okay, we're stuck here,
so let's talk strategy.

56:39.530 --> 56:40.996
Helper, how many
ships do we have,

56:40.998 --> 56:43.866
working ones, functioning ones?

56:43.868 --> 56:46.568
-Oh, there's got to be...

56:46.570 --> 56:48.103
-117.

56:48.105 --> 56:49.872
-Oh.

56:49.874 --> 56:51.774
That's more than
I thought, actually.

56:51.776 --> 56:54.910
-It's not enough.
-No.

56:54.912 --> 56:57.112
-I mean, all we have to do
is take out the warship.

56:57.114 --> 56:59.548
-Oh, is that it?

57:00.418 --> 57:02.484
-We don't have enough ships
for a direct assault.

57:02.486 --> 57:06.121
But maybe they can
buy us some time.

57:08.993 --> 57:11.593
-Time for what?

57:13.464 --> 57:14.196
-We don't have Denz,

57:14.198 --> 57:16.498
but we have a ship and
we have the Mana bomb.

57:16.500 --> 57:19.067
You guys saw what it did
to the Bounty.

57:19.069 --> 57:22.971
Maybe if we get
onboard the warship...

57:23.541 --> 57:25.474
I don't know...
maybe we can...

57:25.476 --> 57:26.475
-Astera?

57:26.477 --> 57:31.013
The people who came to Haven,
they're not fighters.

57:31.015 --> 57:33.449
They're not leaders.

57:33.451 --> 57:34.683
Look what they did.

57:34.685 --> 57:36.985
They turned a warship
into a warehouse.

57:36.987 --> 57:39.888
If we send them into
a battle they can't win...

57:39.890 --> 57:44.760
-We can win.
We just need a plan.

57:45.930 --> 57:47.896
-Maybe.

57:47.898 --> 57:51.667
Maybe Haven does need a leader.

57:51.669 --> 57:54.236
-Corbryn,
you're Haven's leader.

57:54.238 --> 57:56.071
I mean, you've gotten
them this far.

57:56.073 --> 57:59.908
Just keep doing
what you're doing. Don't even...

57:59.910 --> 58:01.043
What's that?

58:01.045 --> 58:01.743
-Huh?

58:01.745 --> 58:04.613
Oh, just one of
the many uses of Mana.

58:04.615 --> 58:05.681
These are traveler's tokens.

58:05.683 --> 58:07.683
They hold the records
of the ones who came,

58:07.685 --> 58:10.219
how they got here,
where they came from.

58:10.221 --> 58:11.687
-Do they work?

58:11.689 --> 58:13.989
-Yeah.

58:13.991 --> 58:17.025
Where did you get that?

58:17.027 --> 58:18.694
-From my mom.

58:18.696 --> 58:19.828
She died trying to get here.

58:19.830 --> 58:22.030
Must have been one of the
distress beacons

58:22.032 --> 58:23.732
that Denz missed.

58:23.734 --> 58:26.268
Just another reason
to hate the Coalition.

58:26.270 --> 58:28.770
-Are you sure...

58:29.073 --> 58:30.839
you want to?

58:31.542 --> 58:33.642
-I have to.

58:41.151 --> 58:43.952
<i> -There's no time!</i>
<i> They're coming!</i>

58:43.954 --> 58:44.920
[Astera] What is this?

58:44.922 --> 58:47.856
<i> -I need you to help her!</i>
<i> Stay with her!</i>

58:47.858 --> 58:51.159
-The program's been wiped
from my memory.

58:51.228 --> 58:55.697
<i> -Keep her safe, okay?</i>
<i> Promise me!</i>

58:55.966 --> 58:58.800
<i> Make sure she knows.</i>

58:58.802 --> 59:01.069
<i>Make sure she knows I love her.</i>

59:01.071 --> 59:05.774
<i> You... You can record.</i>

59:08.012 --> 59:14.616
<i>Astera, it may take a long time</i>
<i> for you to understand this.</i>

59:14.618 --> 59:17.219
That's my mom.

59:17.221 --> 59:23.292
<i> I want a better life for you</i>
<i> and I tried for that,</i>

59:23.294 --> 59:25.794
<i> but I failed.</i>

59:26.597 --> 59:28.864
<i> I need you.</i>

59:29.099 --> 59:33.835
<i> If your father were to ever</i>
<i> find Haven, he will destroy!</i>

59:34.638 --> 59:39.775
<i>I hate to burden you with this.</i>
<i> You're still so young.</i>

59:39.777 --> 59:44.079
<i> But one day,</i>
<i> you will have to remember</i>

59:44.081 --> 59:47.249
<i>that no life is worth a planet,</i>

59:47.251 --> 59:51.954
<i> not mine, not his,</i>

59:51.956 --> 59:53.989
<i> not even yours.</i>

59:54.959 --> 59:56.858
<i> Promise me.</i>

59:58.262 --> 01:00:00.162
<i> I love you.</i>

01:00:02.866 --> 01:00:04.166
-What's happening?

01:00:04.168 --> 01:00:05.667
Helper?

01:00:05.669 --> 01:00:09.104
-Astera, look away.

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:15.143
-Who would...

01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:15.944
Zelus!

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:20.182
-Citizens of Haven!
The deadline has expired!

01:00:20.184 --> 01:00:21.116
-We're out of time.

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:24.353
-Send forth your representative
and prepare for surrender

01:00:24.355 --> 01:00:28.123
or face the full power
of the Coalition!

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.861
-What's that?
-That's my ship!

01:00:33.897 --> 01:00:35.931
My ship!

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:44.039
[grunts]

01:00:50.381 --> 01:00:52.014
-I told you, fiend!

01:00:52.016 --> 01:00:57.419
I made a promise to protect
this planet and its people,

01:00:57.421 --> 01:01:01.356
and another,
to avenge my brothers...

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:04.092
and I intend to keep both.

01:01:04.094 --> 01:01:07.396
-Paladin, you can barely stand.

01:01:07.398 --> 01:01:12.801
-And yet I stand with them.

01:01:18.242 --> 01:01:20.809
-Open fire!

01:01:21.912 --> 01:01:24.813
-Corbryn, it's now or never.

01:01:25.983 --> 01:01:27.215
-Attention all ships!

01:01:27.217 --> 01:01:30.052
Anyone on this band, anyone
who can hear me, attack!

01:01:30.054 --> 01:01:34.923
Get your asses in the air
and fight to save your planet!

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:50.005
[gasps]

01:01:58.449 --> 01:02:01.116
[coughing]

01:02:08.459 --> 01:02:09.324
-Is it bad?

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:12.294
Oh, yeah, it's bad, isn't it?

01:02:12.296 --> 01:02:14.329
Check the box.

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:15.330
-What box?

01:02:15.332 --> 01:02:18.033
-The green metal one.

01:02:28.212 --> 01:02:29.044
[coughing]

01:02:29.046 --> 01:02:30.879
They'll come for it.

01:02:30.881 --> 01:02:33.915
-We gotta get out of here.
-I'm ready.

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:41.022
-Corbryn, snap out of it!
We have to get out of here!

01:02:41.024 --> 01:02:42.491
-No, they'll come
for the Mana core!

01:02:42.493 --> 01:02:45.494
-Corbryn, the battle's
out there now!

01:02:45.496 --> 01:02:47.395
We have to leave!

01:02:47.397 --> 01:02:50.799
Okay, let's go!

01:02:50.801 --> 01:02:53.435
Helper?
-Go!

01:02:55.339 --> 01:02:57.873
I'll hold them off!

01:02:58.876 --> 01:03:02.911
<i> [Malastor] What's happening</i>
<i> down there?</i>

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:04.079
-They attacked!

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:05.413
Peace was offered and declined!

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:08.350
I had no choice but to respond!

01:03:08.485 --> 01:03:10.886
-Zelus, I told you
to hold until I gave...

01:03:10.888 --> 01:03:13.188
-They have the Paladin
with them!

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:15.190
If I hold, I die!

01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:20.529
Continue the attack!

01:03:20.531 --> 01:03:22.464
-Bring us in now.

01:03:24.568 --> 01:03:26.334
-Astera!

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:32.908
Your father wants to see you.

01:03:38.115 --> 01:03:40.215
[grunts]

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:26.862
Yield.

01:04:26.864 --> 01:04:28.296
-Never.

01:04:47.251 --> 01:04:50.352
-I see the champion
still stands.

01:04:50.354 --> 01:04:53.955
Show them what happens when
you defy the Coalition.

01:04:53.957 --> 01:04:56.258
Make him surrender.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:59.227
Fire the tractor beam.

01:05:04.434 --> 01:05:07.035
[screams]

01:05:15.946 --> 01:05:16.544
-Bastard!

01:05:16.546 --> 01:05:19.147
What? Are you gonna kill me
like you killed her, too?

01:05:19.149 --> 01:05:21.349
[gasps]

01:05:23.186 --> 01:05:24.986
[choking]

01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:27.355
-Let her go!

01:05:28.058 --> 01:05:29.491
-You killed her.

01:05:29.493 --> 01:05:35.263
She tried to run,
like you tried to kill me.

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:36.131
But you can't.

01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:40.468
-I didn't kill your
traitor of a mother,

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:44.172
though I gladly would
have for what she did!

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:54.249
-Then who?

01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:57.519
-I suggest you ask your father.

01:06:01.658 --> 01:06:03.959
-Dad, stop!

01:06:03.961 --> 01:06:09.297
-Astera, I'm so glad to
see that you're safe.

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:11.066
It pleases me how
integral you were

01:06:11.068 --> 01:06:13.468
to the Coalition's
victory here today.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:16.604
-Dad, let him go.
Please.

01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:18.707
-He chose the wrong side.

01:06:18.709 --> 01:06:23.411
You, on the other hand,
have managed to elude capture

01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:25.447
and deliver not only
the rebel leader,

01:06:25.449 --> 01:06:27.415
but the location of
their hidden base,

01:06:27.417 --> 01:06:32.487
and the very source
of their power.

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:36.091
Quite a resource
kept hidden so long.

01:06:36.093 --> 01:06:38.493
It would have brought
great advancements

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:39.494
to the Coalition effort

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:44.299
if you had not kept it for
your own selfish needs.

01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:48.503
-Guess I thought
the Coalition had enough power.

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:50.238
-You thought wrong.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.674
I understand you're
in possession of a frequency

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:55.443
we use to calibrate
our instruments

01:06:55.445 --> 01:06:58.747
to extract the source.

01:06:58.749 --> 01:07:00.482
-It's not gonna happen.

01:07:00.484 --> 01:07:03.451
-Oh? I see.

01:07:06.223 --> 01:07:07.722
[chokes]

01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:08.456
-Stop!

01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:12.293
-The Paladin is neutralized,

01:07:12.295 --> 01:07:16.598
your fleet decimated,
base is in ruins!

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.400
And the battle already lost.

01:07:18.402 --> 01:07:23.605
You can choose to be the leader
Haven needs right now!

01:07:23.607 --> 01:07:25.106
You can stop the war!

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:29.044
You can save what's left
of the refugees, or...

01:07:29.046 --> 01:07:32.113
You can watch as
I obliterate this planet.

01:07:32.115 --> 01:07:36.451
Give me the rebel frequency
and surrender!

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.455
End this.
Full-scale assault, planet wide.

01:07:40.457 --> 01:07:44.793
We'll just have to extract
the core from the rubble.

01:07:44.795 --> 01:07:46.561
[chuckles]

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:48.196
-No! Wait!

01:07:48.198 --> 01:07:49.097
-Corbryn!

01:07:49.099 --> 01:07:51.566
-Wait! Stop!

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:53.735
-Cease fire.

01:07:57.374 --> 01:07:59.674
-It's the people or the planet.

01:08:15.158 --> 01:08:17.192
-It worked.

01:08:18.562 --> 01:08:20.627
-Begin extraction.

01:08:21.798 --> 01:08:24.198
-No! No, wait!

01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:25.200
I surrendered!

01:08:25.202 --> 01:08:28.770
There's people down there!
You said refugees...

01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:34.142
-They stopped being refugees
when the deadline expired.

01:08:34.144 --> 01:08:35.376
You had your chance.

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:38.513
-You liar!
-Do it.

01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:56.631
[groans]

01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:58.332
-Denz!

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:02.636
-The Paladin
makes an appearance.

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:16.518
-Denz!

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.685
-Put the rebel leader
with the rest

01:09:18.688 --> 01:09:21.156
of the criminals
in the Brig.

01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:22.423
-And the Paladin?

01:09:22.425 --> 01:09:24.759
-He won't make any
further difference here.

01:09:24.761 --> 01:09:28.229
He did the worst of
his damage a long time ago.

01:09:28.231 --> 01:09:29.663
-Kill him?

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:33.434
-No! Dad, please!

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:37.839
-Put him back in his ship.

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:40.875
Make sure that
he's in hyper sleep.

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:44.645
Oh, and make sure he has a view.

01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:46.247
Perhaps in a thousand cycles,

01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:48.716
he will have atoned
for his betrayal.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.489
-Let's go.

01:09:54.491 --> 01:09:56.925
You, too.

01:09:56.927 --> 01:09:59.327
Move!

01:10:06.403 --> 01:10:09.871
Don't try anything stupid.

01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:18.413
<i> [Squire] I have to say,</i>
<i> Paladin, I had hoped</i>

01:10:18.415 --> 01:10:19.647
<i> things would end differently.</i>

01:10:19.649 --> 01:10:20.915
<i> See you in a thousand cycles.</i>

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:22.817
-No! No!
<i>-Hypersleep sequence initiated.</i>

01:10:22.819 --> 01:10:26.888
-Squire! Cancel!
Open the door!

01:10:27.691 --> 01:10:29.857
-Dad...
-We will speak later.

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:33.861
Until then, I expect you
to remain in your quarters.

01:10:33.863 --> 01:10:37.298
-Are you really
sending me to my room?

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:40.602
-There are
far worse alternatives.

01:10:40.604 --> 01:10:43.972
I hope you know how much
I strive to keep you

01:10:43.974 --> 01:10:47.942
from being suspected of more
than childish rebelliousness!

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:51.846
I hope you know
that everything I've done

01:10:51.848 --> 01:10:54.582
has been to protect you!

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:56.618
-From who, Dad?

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:57.952
Your Coalition?

01:10:57.954 --> 01:10:59.687
What does that tell you?

01:10:59.689 --> 01:11:03.992
-Like it or not, we are the
force of order in the galaxy.

01:11:03.994 --> 01:11:09.464
I'd hoped you'd learn that
sooner than your mother did.

01:11:09.466 --> 01:11:14.435
Please don't repeat
her mistakes.

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:19.540
-Sure.

01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:33.021
-Hey, guys,
wanna blow this joint?

01:11:33.023 --> 01:11:34.022
[chuckles]

01:11:34.024 --> 01:11:37.558
-Do you have access to Honor?
<i> -[Helper] They're</i>
<i> jamming my signal.</i>

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.693
<i> I can't get inside.</i>

01:11:38.695 --> 01:11:39.761
-Can you reach it from here?

01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:41.496
<i> -I can try.</i>
-Do it.

01:11:41.498 --> 01:11:44.966
Let Denz keep them busy.
I'll get Corbryn.

01:11:46.002 --> 01:11:47.769
-Open the door!

01:11:47.771 --> 01:11:49.704
[grunting]

01:12:03.086 --> 01:12:04.986
[thumping]

01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:08.556
<i> [Astera] Captain Ajax,</i>
<i> can you hear me?</i>

01:12:08.558 --> 01:12:11.492
<i> Captain Ajax, are you there?</i>

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:15.596
-Yeah, I hear you.
Hold on.

01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:24.972
-That was using your head.

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:27.909
No hard feelings?

01:12:28.912 --> 01:12:32.714
-No more tricks?

01:12:32.716 --> 01:12:34.782
-No more tricks.

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:39.487
-This should work...I think.

01:12:39.756 --> 01:12:43.424
-Get off your asses!
It's time to fight!

01:12:43.426 --> 01:12:44.359
-2,756 Novaks...

01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:46.027
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, a lot
of Novaks...it's all right.

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:47.595
I got it.
Here, let's get out of here.

01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:51.032
-He's coming.
I'll show you the way!

01:12:51.601 --> 01:12:52.867
-Astera, what about you?

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.068
-I'll disable the tractor beam.

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:55.536
-What if...
-Shut up!

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:56.871
I know this ship
better than anyone.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:57.939
I can get around faster.

01:12:57.941 --> 01:13:00.608
-Yeah, but what about...
-Don't worry about me!

01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:01.676
You're their leader now,

01:13:01.678 --> 01:13:05.680
so get out there and lead
and let's win this thing.

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:13.154
-I need to get
into that warship.

01:13:13.156 --> 01:13:16.057
-No way they're gonna
let us dock now.

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:18.693
-They wouldn't have to
if it wasn't

01:13:18.695 --> 01:13:20.728
for the damage to
this blasted armor.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.497
My battery's almost depleted.

01:13:22.499 --> 01:13:27.969
-You kidding me?
We got all the power you need.

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:34.509
-Let's hope this works.

01:13:35.011 --> 01:13:38.646
-Like mother, like daughter!

01:13:38.648 --> 01:13:40.047
-I'm--

01:13:46.523 --> 01:13:48.456
-Zelus!

01:13:48.458 --> 01:13:50.725
-Hello, Paladin!

01:13:50.727 --> 01:13:52.560
-That's enough!

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:57.465
-Out of all the Paladins
I've killed,

01:13:57.467 --> 01:14:01.102
your death is going to be
the one I enjoy the most.

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:03.971
[straining]

01:14:06.476 --> 01:14:09.577
[continues]

01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:22.156
-This one's for Haven!

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:36.537
Denz...?

01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:39.674
-Are you all right?

01:14:39.676 --> 01:14:40.208
-Yeah.

01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:44.045
There's just one more
thing I have to do.

01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:49.083
I'll meet you at your ship.

01:14:49.085 --> 01:14:53.054
Dad! Come out here!
-Astera?

01:14:55.558 --> 01:14:56.657
Is this what you wanted?

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:58.226
Destroying an entire planet,

01:14:58.228 --> 01:15:00.194
killing thousands
of innocent people?

01:15:00.196 --> 01:15:03.898
-They stole the ship
that brought them here.

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:07.068
They stole the resources
to fuel it.

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:08.169
From the moment of its founding,

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:11.572
this planet has been nothing
but a malignant tumor

01:15:11.574 --> 01:15:14.675
feeding off the lifeblood
of the Coalition.

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:19.013
And now that tumor
has been removed.

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:19.947
-No.

01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:21.148
I don't think it was the tumor.

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:26.187
I think you just can't stand
to see people free.

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:27.655
-Astera, come on...

01:15:27.657 --> 01:15:29.156
-No, don't.

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:33.194
You don't get
to do that anymore.

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:38.099
I have a ship ready and waiting.

01:15:38.968 --> 01:15:39.934
I just need to, um...

01:15:39.936 --> 01:15:44.605
I just need to know
one thing about Mom.

01:15:44.974 --> 01:15:48.109
You said she died
trying to get to Haven.

01:15:49.212 --> 01:15:51.245
-That's right.

01:15:51.247 --> 01:15:52.613
-But she got there.

01:15:52.615 --> 01:15:55.917
She just never
made it back, right?

01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:59.220
-Astera, don't ask...
-Was it you?

01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:02.823
-I loved your mother
very much.

01:16:02.825 --> 01:16:04.592
-Did you kill her?

01:16:04.594 --> 01:16:05.826
-She betrayed me!

01:16:05.828 --> 01:16:08.829
You! She betrayed us all!

01:16:08.831 --> 01:16:10.698
-Did you?

01:16:11.868 --> 01:16:14.001
-She had an option.

01:16:14.003 --> 01:16:15.603
She chose her path!

01:16:15.605 --> 01:16:20.708
I didn't want to do it,
but she forced my hand!

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:28.716
Your mother made her own choice.

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:35.723
-Yeah, and I've made mine.

01:16:39.996 --> 01:16:41.896
-Astera...

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:45.933
Then you'll die with
the rest of them.

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:49.170
<i> [woman] Sir,</i>
<i> the rebel fleet is out.</i>

01:16:49.172 --> 01:16:51.973
[Malastor] Release the fighters.

01:16:56.245 --> 01:16:57.812
<i> [Corbryn] Calling all ships!</i>

01:16:57.814 --> 01:16:59.146
That's your planet's
heart down there!

01:16:59.148 --> 01:17:01.682
Let's pull it together
and end this thing.

01:17:01.684 --> 01:17:02.350
Everyone on me!

01:17:02.352 --> 01:17:03.384
<i> [man] We're with you!</i>

01:17:03.386 --> 01:17:05.753
<i> [Corbryn] Watch your backs.</i>
<i> Here they come!</i>

01:17:05.755 --> 01:17:07.722
-Get them!

01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:11.125
-You got one behind you!

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:14.729
-He's locked on to me.
I'm going to try to lose him.

01:17:14.731 --> 01:17:15.796
A little help would be nice.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:18.933
-Hang in there.
Twell's on him.

01:17:21.104 --> 01:17:24.105
<i> [Corbryn] If you have it,</i>
<i> take the shot.</i>

01:17:24.107 --> 01:17:26.007
<i> Fire!</i>

01:17:28.778 --> 01:17:30.911
<i> [Corbryn] Whoa! Nice shot!</i>

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.681
<i> [Corbryn] Okay,</i>
<i> I'm going for the beam.</i>
<i> Cover me.</i>

01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:35.916
We're on you.

01:17:39.389 --> 01:17:40.421
<i> Whoa! Yeah!</i>

01:17:40.423 --> 01:17:43.290
That tractor beam's down,
but the warship's still kicking!

01:17:43.292 --> 01:17:45.893
We gotta get that Mana core
back down to the surface.

01:17:45.895 --> 01:17:46.927
Any ideas?

01:17:46.929 --> 01:17:48.729
<i> [Ajax] I might have one.</i>

01:17:48.731 --> 01:17:51.866
-Great. We could use
a pirate trick right now.

01:17:51.868 --> 01:17:54.935
<i> [Ajax] I got just the thing,</i>
<i> but I got to get a signal out.</i>

01:17:54.937 --> 01:17:57.038
<i> You'll have to give</i>
<i> me the frequency.</i>

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:01.208
-That I can do.
Sending it now.

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:02.843
-Oh, I got it.

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:06.147
<i> [Denz] I hope this works.</i>
<i> [Ajax] So do I.</i>

01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:10.351
Come on, baby.
One last jump.

01:18:12.121 --> 01:18:19.894
[woman] Prepare for impact.
In three... two... one.

01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:24.765
Yeah! Ramming speed, baby!

01:18:25.902 --> 01:18:28.469
Oh, sorry.

01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:31.172
[Denz] Wait. The Mana core
isn't moving.

01:18:31.174 --> 01:18:33.474
-It's already escaped the
planet's gravitational pull.

01:18:33.476 --> 01:18:35.376
<i> [Corbryn] You're</i>
<i> going to have to use that ship</i>

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:38.012
<i> and push it back down.</i>

01:18:38.014 --> 01:18:40.314
-The ship's only got
one pod left.

01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:43.184
Take it, get to safety.
When I'm done here, hopefully,

01:18:43.186 --> 01:18:45.352
there will still be planet
left for me to land on.

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:48.189
-That's all I needed to hear.

01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:50.291
You coming?

01:18:50.293 --> 01:18:51.892
-What are you doing?
Are you not coming?

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:55.196
-Someone needs to stay
if this doesn't work.

01:18:55.198 --> 01:18:55.996
-It'll work.

01:18:55.998 --> 01:18:58.032
-Then I'll see you
on the surface.

01:18:58.034 --> 01:19:00.968
-I'm not gonna
leave you here alone.

01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:02.136
-Ahem.

01:19:02.138 --> 01:19:05.206
He won't be.
I'll stay.

01:19:05.942 --> 01:19:08.309
Not like I have a choice
in the matter anymore.

01:19:08.311 --> 01:19:12.079
Honor holds the last copy
of my programming.

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:14.181
-Helper, I'm so sorry.

01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:16.217
I completely forgot
that you'll...

01:19:16.219 --> 01:19:18.018
-You'll die.
-Yes.

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:19.787
-Lucky for you,
self-preservation

01:19:19.789 --> 01:19:22.823
is not a core dictate
of my programming.

01:19:22.959 --> 01:19:25.326
-Thank you, Helper,
for everything.

01:19:25.328 --> 01:19:28.062
-It's been
a considerable pleasure.

01:19:28.064 --> 01:19:31.866
I am, after all, here to help.

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:40.775
-Commander Corbryn, pull back
and get your people to safety!

01:19:40.777 --> 01:19:43.210
<i> [Corbryn]</i> All right,
I thought you'd never ask.

01:19:43.212 --> 01:19:46.247
<i> Give her everything</i>
<i> you got!</i>

01:19:51.554 --> 01:19:53.921
-It's not enough!

01:19:58.127 --> 01:20:00.060
-It's not working.

01:20:02.198 --> 01:20:06.066
Helper, I'm sorry.

01:20:06.369 --> 01:20:11.505
Squire, ready the self-destruct
and activate on reentry.

01:20:11.507 --> 01:20:13.340
The blast should be
powerful enough

01:20:13.342 --> 01:20:15.576
to send the Mana core
back to the ground.

01:20:15.578 --> 01:20:18.846
But I will need
to pilot us within range.

01:20:18.848 --> 01:20:19.947
-Denz, allow me.

01:20:19.949 --> 01:20:23.217
You've already sacrificed
yourself once for Haven.

01:20:23.219 --> 01:20:24.819
You don't need to do it again.

01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:27.121
I can handle the ship.

01:20:28.157 --> 01:20:32.459
-Helper, this... this war,

01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:35.029
it's all my fault.

01:20:35.031 --> 01:20:39.333
And the fate of this planet
is my burden to bear.

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:43.604
<i> [Squire] Self-destruct</i>
<i> sequence initiated.</i>

01:20:43.606 --> 01:20:46.340
-Not anymore it's not.

01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:54.315
-Thank you, Helper.

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:07.394
<i>[Squire] Self-destruct in five,</i>
<i> four, three, two...</i>

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:10.064
[explosion]

01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:16.537
-They did it!

01:21:23.179 --> 01:21:25.379
Denz! You made it!

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:26.647
-I had some help.

01:21:26.649 --> 01:21:28.616
-Are we all gonna die?

01:21:28.618 --> 01:21:30.551
-Not today.

01:21:30.653 --> 01:21:33.420
I guess you won't be going
into hyper sleep again.

01:21:33.422 --> 01:21:34.922
-I hope not.

01:21:34.924 --> 01:21:35.556
-That's good.

01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:40.327
Haven could use some wisdom from
the ages, healthy perspectives.

01:21:40.329 --> 01:21:42.630
-I guess you're right.

01:21:42.632 --> 01:21:45.599
-The Coalition's
not gonna leave Haven alone,

01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:48.002
not after this.

01:21:48.371 --> 01:21:49.203
-She's right.

01:21:49.205 --> 01:21:50.571
They'll want to know
what happened.

01:21:50.573 --> 01:21:51.572
They'll come looking.

01:21:51.574 --> 01:21:55.142
-And when they do,
we'll be ready.
