00:00.044 --> 00:02.110
Is that why you don't wear
a wedding ring?

00:02.522 --> 00:03.811
Look, I like you.

00:03.812 --> 00:07.632
- It's probably better for both of us if we just...
- I totally agree with you.

00:07.703 --> 00:10.575
It's nature, and there's
a fox in my henhouse, and I don't like it.

00:10.576 --> 00:14.097
My brother, who is in prison because of me,
asked me to look after her.

00:15.006 --> 00:16.072
Hey, Epyck.

00:16.073 --> 00:17.958
How the hell do you know
my schedule, anyways?

00:17.959 --> 00:19.359
I think he's smoking marijuana.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.028
Send Buddy junior home to Dillon.

00:21.029 --> 00:22.663
Jess Merriweather, all right?

00:22.697 --> 00:24.598
She's the new equipment manager with us.

00:24.599 --> 00:28.319
My dad just got out of prison,
and my mom, she asked me to forgive him.

00:28.415 --> 00:30.164
You asked me to be better.

00:30.165 --> 00:33.241
I don't know how,
because he never taught me!

00:38.340 --> 00:40.749
- It was an emergency.
- Oh, an emergency, huh?

00:40.750 --> 00:42.527
- I had to.
- Had to?

00:42.528 --> 00:44.270
- That's...
- I had to. I had to.

00:44.271 --> 00:46.030
- Really?
- It was. It was, baby.

00:46.031 --> 00:48.110
What, you're heartsick or something?

00:48.111 --> 00:50.495
- I am!
- You're such a baby!

00:50.496 --> 00:51.892
I don't get to see you anymore.

00:51.893 --> 00:53.283
- You're a baby.
- I am.

00:53.284 --> 00:57.307
I see you every day in the field house, like
yesterday when I was folding those towels...

00:57.308 --> 00:59.310
- That doesn't count.
- In fifth period...

00:59.311 --> 01:01.422
I can't do this while you fold towels.

01:01.423 --> 01:03.971
- Oh, whatever, okay.
- Okay.

01:05.540 --> 01:07.377
Jess and Vince kissing like a fish...

01:07.407 --> 01:09.038
Jess and Vince...

01:09.068 --> 01:11.071
- You stay right there. I'm gonna come get you.
- Get away!

01:11.744 --> 01:13.810
- Rugrats!
- I got them.

01:31.826 --> 01:33.233
Hey, can I help you?

01:35.153 --> 01:38.111
Yeah. I was just wondering if I could
have some girls over here tomorrow...

01:38.112 --> 01:40.682
- ...for the dance planning committee.
- The who?

01:40.683 --> 01:43.780
Well, East Dillon's having a dance,
which they haven't done in, like, 20 years,

01:43.781 --> 01:45.744
and so I signed up for the dance committee.

01:45.745 --> 01:48.685
I just thought that
a few girls could come over and...

01:48.686 --> 01:50.722
talk about decorations and stuff.

01:50.723 --> 01:52.362
I said we could host it over here.

01:53.171 --> 01:54.171
Is that okay?

01:54.172 --> 01:56.407
Dude, when's your mom getting
back from that casino boat?

01:57.835 --> 02:01.141
You know, never mind. We can do it
at school. It's not a big deal.

02:01.142 --> 02:03.687
No. Yes, Becks, yes.
God, they can come over here.

02:03.688 --> 02:06.990
It's just not gonna be
a freakin' slumber party at my house.

02:06.991 --> 02:09.502
Oh, no. They'll just be here
for a couple hours, tops.

02:09.503 --> 02:10.834
That sounds awesome.

02:11.626 --> 02:12.866
You're looking good.

02:21.818 --> 02:24.241
So, um, flight okay?

02:25.216 --> 02:26.402
It was good.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.312
The movie sucked.

02:28.878 --> 02:31.118
Always play those chick flicks.

02:31.119 --> 02:33.727
- Yeah.
- That what it was, chick flick?

02:33.728 --> 02:35.338
Yeah, it was something like that.

02:38.928 --> 02:40.037
Hey, you hungry?

02:40.205 --> 02:41.236
No, I'm good.

02:41.237 --> 02:44.520
We used to say, "d'ya eat? No, d'you?
Well, 'sgoeat."

02:45.087 --> 02:46.687
We can go eat, if you...

02:46.688 --> 02:48.909
- No, I'm... I'm good.
- No. All right, good, good.

02:48.910 --> 02:53.380
We'll just stop by the store, and we'll get
some groceries, whatever you like to eat.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.534
Sounds good.

02:54.656 --> 02:56.983
Just as long as you
don't make me eat seitan.

02:57.744 --> 02:58.945
Satan?

02:59.152 --> 03:00.420
What the hell's that?

03:00.543 --> 03:02.886
It's... it's like...
it's like wheat gluten.

03:03.213 --> 03:05.279
I don't know. Kevin's obsessed with it.

03:06.469 --> 03:07.469
Why?

03:07.470 --> 03:10.188
I don't know.
He says it's like nature's meat.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.185
Well, nature already has meat.

03:15.202 --> 03:16.656
It's called a cow.

03:20.479 --> 03:22.339
Oh, my God, is that...?

03:23.474 --> 03:25.212
- Yep.
- Damn. It's like...

03:25.213 --> 03:27.266
the saddest place in the world.

03:28.190 --> 03:31.299
God, you can't make anything
in your life work, can you?

03:45.252 --> 03:46.476
Hut!

03:54.068 --> 03:55.371
Good. That's good.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.841
Hut!

04:25.661 --> 04:27.383
Come on, let's go.

04:29.196 --> 04:30.397
Hey, Luke!

04:30.979 --> 04:32.195
Luke.

04:33.343 --> 04:34.560
Hustle up.

04:35.461 --> 04:37.193
- Hustle up.
- Hey, Coach.

04:38.247 --> 04:40.821
Karl, this is Luke. Luke, this is
Karl Gage from over at T.M.U.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.296
- How you doing, son?
- Very well, thank you.

04:42.297 --> 04:43.857
- You look good out there.
- Thank you, sir.

04:43.858 --> 04:46.526
- You playing both ways, offense and defense, right?
- Yes, sir, I am.

04:46.527 --> 04:49.201
- We like that... iron man.
- Yes, sir.

04:49.244 --> 04:51.874
Look, I'd, uh... I'd like to sit down
with you sometime...

04:51.878 --> 04:53.838
- Really? Thank you.
- Talk about your plans.

04:53.839 --> 04:57.271
- I'd love to. Thank you, sir.
- Why don't we bring you over to T.M.U.?

04:57.272 --> 05:00.258
You can look around the campus,
meet the players, meet the coaches.

05:00.316 --> 05:02.479
Yes, sir. I'd be honored. Thank you.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.708
- Well, good. We'll set it up with this guy.
- All right, thank you.

05:04.709 --> 05:06.237
- Thanks, Karl.
- Thanks, coach.

05:06.238 --> 05:07.881
All right. Get out there.

05:08.405 --> 05:09.732
Hit it, boy.

05:10.452 --> 05:11.698
Yeah.

05:15.117 --> 05:16.361
Hey, Vince!

05:17.043 --> 05:18.289
Come here.

05:18.445 --> 05:19.676
Hustle up!

05:22.019 --> 05:23.823
- Yes, sir.
- Who's that up there?

05:26.231 --> 05:27.418
That's my dad.

05:28.466 --> 05:29.787
That's your dad?

05:30.764 --> 05:32.006
Hey, come here!

05:32.225 --> 05:33.646
Don't walk away. Come here.

05:33.647 --> 05:35.960
After practice,
I want you to introduce me.

05:36.947 --> 05:38.621
How about I don't, coach?

05:38.737 --> 05:40.629
I got to get back to this play, coach.

05:45.048 --> 05:46.421
Ready, set...

05:47.062 --> 05:48.301
Hut!

And remember, you can buy
your tickets at the door, but why wait?

06:41.174 --> 06:44.805
The dance committee will be selling
tickets in the cafeteria all week.

06:45.065 --> 06:47.094
And it's a bye week this week, so...

06:47.095 --> 06:49.450
hope to see you all at the dance.

06:52.763 --> 06:55.478
Holy mental hospital. Oh, my God.

06:55.981 --> 06:57.996
Does mom know you're taking me
to the ghetto school?

06:57.997 --> 07:00.332
Hey, I don't want to hear
you talk like that, okay?

07:00.634 --> 07:01.995
Look at the place.

07:01.996 --> 07:03.540
Things are gonna be different.

07:03.849 --> 07:06.309
You're gonna get involved...
I want you to join things,

07:06.310 --> 07:09.135
be a part of the community,
get a new life.

07:09.136 --> 07:11.200
- Hey, Buddy!
- Hello, Mrs. Taylor.

07:11.201 --> 07:12.806
- Mrs. Taylor...
- Oh, my goodness.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.189
- Buddy Garrity junior.
- Good to see you!

07:15.190 --> 07:19.184
Oh, my gosh, you have grown
a mile since I saw you last.

07:19.185 --> 07:22.625
Yep. He's a little taller than I was
when I was a sophomore,

07:22.626 --> 07:25.720
and the doctor says he'll grow
about two or three more inches, so...

07:25.721 --> 07:27.091
Hat... hat off.

07:27.649 --> 07:29.195
You have your schedule and all that?

07:29.196 --> 07:31.356
- I guess this is your first day.
- I think I'm good to go.

07:31.357 --> 07:34.249
Do you guys like do shock
treatment here or something?

07:35.257 --> 07:37.897
Yeah. He's, uh...  he's hilarious.

07:37.976 --> 07:39.638
- He is hilarious.
- He's hilarious.

07:39.639 --> 07:41.444
Apologize to Ms. Taylor.

07:42.448 --> 07:43.157
Sorry.

07:43.158 --> 07:46.258
We're just going through
that attitude adjustment, so...

07:46.358 --> 07:49.177
You know what? I'd be happy to take you to
the front office. We can get you all set up.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.127
- Yeah. I think I got it.
- This way.

07:51.128 --> 07:52.515
- Oh, you do?
- It's cool.

07:52.516 --> 07:54.386
- Okay.
- Have a good day, Bud.

07:54.387 --> 07:55.558
Yeah.

07:56.183 --> 07:57.684
You must be thrilled.

07:58.408 --> 07:59.933
Good word.

08:01.175 --> 08:02.284
Good luck.

08:10.097 --> 08:11.231
Hey, Jess.

08:11.232 --> 08:13.385
Can you hand-wash my new jeans for me?

08:13.501 --> 08:17.003
You know, Chris, I haven't
hand washed your man-bra yet.

08:19.289 --> 08:22.341
I'm gonna have to get to those
after that... after I do the bra.

08:22.614 --> 08:25.329
Hey, Jess, hold up.
You got a phone call.

08:27.092 --> 08:30.051
What's that for? You ain't got
nothing big enough to fit in that.

08:33.789 --> 08:36.289
Come on, now.
At least put your number in it.

08:37.010 --> 08:39.510
Hey, yo, remember
who you're talking to, yo.

08:39.693 --> 08:40.966
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

08:40.967 --> 08:42.861
You know what, fellas?
Vince, look, it's not...

08:42.863 --> 08:44.259
- What up?
- Okay.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.426
- All right, my fault.
- Whatever.

08:47.298 --> 08:48.600
- What?
- Whatever.

08:48.601 --> 08:50.206
What? Wait, hold... Jess.

08:51.368 --> 08:53.220
You know what? I'm not...

08:53.221 --> 08:55.072
Hey, can you wait?
Can you wait a second?

08:55.073 --> 08:56.339
What? Why are you so upset with me?

08:56.340 --> 08:57.605
What the hell was that in there?

08:57.606 --> 09:00.069
- What the hell was what?
- Why you got to be so dramatic?

09:00.070 --> 09:02.413
Dramat... you're upset with me
for defending you.

09:02.414 --> 09:04.984
Are you really serious? I don't even
want no problems with you right now.

09:04.985 --> 09:06.066
Will... Will's in there
talking crap about you.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.147
Are you serious?

09:07.148 --> 09:08.544
We're in the locker room now. All right?

09:08.545 --> 09:10.110
Exactly. And how am I supposed
to go back in there?

09:10.145 --> 09:12.472
- That's embarrassing.
- Then don't.

09:12.950 --> 09:15.783
I'm gonna go do my job, okay?
You do your job.

09:17.362 --> 09:21.357
You two do not have a relationship while
you're in my field house or on my field...

09:21.358 --> 09:22.158
Is that understood?

09:22.258 --> 09:23.345
- Fine with me.
- Good.

09:23.346 --> 09:24.897
- I'm not trying...
- What?

09:25.037 --> 09:28.051
- You're not trying to what?
- I'm not trying to cause anything here.

09:28.052 --> 09:31.010
- I'm not the one looking for drama here.
- He gets on the defensive.

09:31.011 --> 09:34.182
- I'm out here defending you all day!
- Please. You're a drama queen!

09:34.183 --> 09:35.525
All right! Stop it!

09:38.264 --> 09:39.634
Both of you stop it.

09:41.826 --> 09:44.014
Listen, she's the equipment manager.

09:44.015 --> 09:46.025
Get used to it. And you...

09:47.216 --> 09:48.616
you do your job.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.482
Thank you.

09:57.627 --> 10:00.954
- These women getting out of hand.
- Get the hell out of my office.

10:06.396 --> 10:08.725
So what about "Awesome '80s"?

10:08.962 --> 10:11.232
Or, um, "Under the Sea"?

10:12.376 --> 10:14.687
"Texas Luau". Let's take a vote.

10:15.103 --> 10:16.821
All for Texas Luau?

10:18.106 --> 10:20.786
- Okay, Texas Luau it is.
- Becky, you got a phone call.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.392
Hello?

10:27.393 --> 10:29.651
Hey, it's your dad.
Don't you dare hang up.

10:29.652 --> 10:32.965
I tried to call you about a damn dozen times.
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

10:33.042 --> 10:36.176
- 'Cause I didn't want you to yell at me.
- Well, hell, yeah, I'm gonna yell at ya.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.678
You don't just pick up all your crap
and take off. Doreen is really upset.

10:39.679 --> 10:42.475
- Oh, please, she doesn't care.
- Yes, she does care.

10:42.568 --> 10:46.107
You just got to give her a chance.
I'm getting fed up with all this crap.

10:46.205 --> 10:48.064
Look, I'm coming home tomorrow night.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.321
I want you home too.

10:51.254 --> 10:52.440
Is that clear?

10:53.517 --> 10:54.719
Is that clear?

10:55.241 --> 10:57.804
- I don't want to.
- I don't matter what you want.

10:57.805 --> 10:59.847
All right? That's the deal
I made with your mom.

10:59.848 --> 11:02.491
You're gonna stay at home.
Do you understand me?

11:03.715 --> 11:04.916
Yes, sir.

11:05.233 --> 11:06.397
All right.

11:06.507 --> 11:07.941
I will see you tomorrow.

11:14.948 --> 11:16.966
I'll be out of here tomorrow, so...

11:17.548 --> 11:19.092
good news for you.

11:23.162 --> 11:26.259
Okay, so do y'all think that
we should get a band or a DJ?

11:31.374 --> 11:33.503
- Curtis, quit.
- She was talking to me.

11:33.504 --> 11:35.435
I wouldn't waste my breath
on you, dumb ass.

11:35.436 --> 11:37.352
Hey, nobody talk to anyone.

11:37.353 --> 11:38.774
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

11:38.775 --> 11:40.342
How's your math coming?

11:40.597 --> 11:41.692
Great.

11:41.693 --> 11:43.846
Let's start with opening the book.

11:48.001 --> 11:49.775
Show me what you're having
a hard time with.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.363
I'm not having a hard time.

11:51.575 --> 11:53.324
It's math. It's boring.

11:53.325 --> 11:55.685
It's harder for Epyck since
she's technically retarded.

11:55.686 --> 11:58.546
- Hey, now, not that...
- Say that again, bitch!

11:58.547 --> 12:00.422
You're stupid, and you smell
like someone peed on your clothes.

12:00.423 --> 12:02.566
You think you're tough, huh?
Think you're tough? Do something!

12:02.567 --> 12:04.050
- Come here!
- Do something!

12:04.051 --> 12:06.344
- I'll kick your ass!
- Come! Come here! Hey, you will not!

12:06.345 --> 12:08.435
You will come with me right now,
right now.

12:13.295 --> 12:14.926
Okay, get back to work.

12:38.066 --> 12:39.238
Hey!

12:40.447 --> 12:41.652
What the...?

12:42.789 --> 12:44.333
Are you all right, son?

12:46.774 --> 12:47.987
Are you drunk?

12:48.246 --> 12:49.965
So what if I am?

12:51.587 --> 12:54.380
So what did you do,
break in here to steal liquor?

12:54.381 --> 12:56.692
I found a key. It worked.

12:57.960 --> 13:01.642
- I didn't break in. God...
- Well, this is not gonna fly.

13:01.993 --> 13:04.490
You came here to start a new life, son.

13:04.491 --> 13:06.627
This is piss-poor behavior.

13:06.637 --> 13:09.820
You are gonna clean that up right now.
You clean that up.

13:10.031 --> 13:12.764
This ain't the way it's gonna be here.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.206
Are you gon... here.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.934
Here. Here.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.536
Don't throw up on my bar.
You...

13:19.537 --> 13:21.374
God almighty.

13:28.094 --> 13:29.284
Mama?

13:29.940 --> 13:31.130
Yeah?

13:42.878 --> 13:44.053
Yeah?

13:45.955 --> 13:48.258
Yeah, I haven't worn this in years, and...

13:48.748 --> 13:51.138
I didn't know if it
was gonna still fit me, but...

13:51.548 --> 13:54.483
you know, since I'm going
to dinner with your dad, I just...

13:57.069 --> 13:58.700
I made you some meatloaf.

13:58.706 --> 14:02.120
All you have to do is put it in the oven
for 10 minutes on 350, okay, babe?

14:07.419 --> 14:09.989
Uh, all right, so, um,
I look pretty ridiculous.

14:10.023 --> 14:12.639
Is that what that's...
is that what that is? I...

14:12.640 --> 14:14.074
- No, no, mom.
- I mean, I know...

14:14.075 --> 14:17.489
- I probably shouldn't even wear this dress...
- Mom, mom, listen, look...

14:18.443 --> 14:21.248
You're the most beautiful
thing on the planet.

14:25.815 --> 14:27.702
Just... Ma, look, just...

14:28.246 --> 14:29.596
be careful.

14:31.191 --> 14:32.612
- Okay?
- Okay.

14:32.861 --> 14:34.231
I'll be careful.

14:35.745 --> 14:36.956
You're the best.

14:41.501 --> 14:44.132
We've had this conversation before,
young lady.

14:44.448 --> 14:46.035
No fighting, period.

14:46.730 --> 14:48.317
One day suspension.

14:56.569 --> 14:58.191
I wish there was a way we could...

14:58.192 --> 15:00.323
punish these kids
without just sending them home.

15:00.324 --> 15:01.945
I mean, she was smiling.

15:01.955 --> 15:04.320
- Well, fighting's automatic suspension.
- I know.

15:04.767 --> 15:07.140
But now she's gone, you know?

15:07.723 --> 15:09.254
Can't help her when she's gone.

15:09.255 --> 15:11.769
And these are the kids that need it.
This is what I'm talking about,

15:11.770 --> 15:16.077
all of us getting together to support
these kids, talk to them, tell her why...

15:16.078 --> 15:17.228
- ...her behavior's inappropriate.
- I know, I know.

15:17.229 --> 15:21.208
Hey, as of yesterday, the district
asked me to cut 25% off our budget.

15:22.049 --> 15:24.975
I understand that, but you know what?
It doesn't matter how much money we have.

15:24.976 --> 15:26.723
We can help these kids.

15:26.724 --> 15:27.880
I know.

15:28.164 --> 15:30.317
And I do appreciate what you're doing...

15:30.396 --> 15:31.930
with homework club... I really do.

15:33.010 --> 15:35.380
But, Tami, we got bigger fish to fry.

15:36.399 --> 15:37.626
Okay?

15:45.561 --> 15:46.762
Hey.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.291
Hey, Stevie.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.989
Evaluate me.

15:59.983 --> 16:01.821
- What?
- Judge my ass.

16:01.822 --> 16:03.895
What is wrong with my ass?

16:03.905 --> 16:06.854
- Nothing.
- I finally lose every last ounce of baby weight,

16:06.864 --> 16:09.646
and I go back to the Landing Strip
for the first time since maternity leave,

16:09.647 --> 16:12.380
and do you want to know what
the fat-ass manager says to me?

16:12.381 --> 16:14.708
- He insulted your ass?
- He said...

16:16.150 --> 16:18.911
he said I could have a day shift.

16:20.996 --> 16:23.668
Do you know what it is like
dancing for a bunch of farmers

16:23.669 --> 16:25.334
with a mouth full of breakfast buffet?

16:25.369 --> 16:27.969
And the worst tippers... the worst!

16:28.937 --> 16:30.437
Okay, well, he's crazy,

16:30.439 --> 16:32.574
first of all, because you look amazing.

16:32.988 --> 16:36.088
You know what you need to do? You need to
go back in there, and you need to negotiate.

16:36.228 --> 16:40.497
Tell him that you'll take one
day shift for a weekend night.

16:40.498 --> 16:41.702
Yeah.

16:42.103 --> 16:43.967
Yeah, I mean, I had regulars.

16:43.968 --> 16:46.245
Yeah, and they probably totally miss you.

16:46.246 --> 16:47.464
Yeah.

16:47.951 --> 16:49.145
Thank you.

16:50.136 --> 16:51.917
Is that for your dance thing?

16:52.033 --> 16:53.564
Oh, yeah.

16:58.398 --> 17:00.633
So listen, my dad's coming back tonight.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.617
Yeah, I forgot.

17:04.767 --> 17:07.401
So can you give me a ride
over there later?

17:07.599 --> 17:08.810
Yeah.

17:10.425 --> 17:11.583
Thanks.

17:21.486 --> 17:22.643
Hey.

17:23.251 --> 17:24.452
Hey.

17:24.622 --> 17:26.513
Glad I ran into you.

17:27.508 --> 17:29.769
What are you doing tomorrow?
Want to get together?

17:32.671 --> 17:34.476
Actually, I have a date.

17:35.050 --> 17:36.260
Good.

17:37.053 --> 17:38.220
That's good.

17:40.440 --> 17:43.463
Good. What do you mean "good"?
Good's like it doesn't really mean anything...

17:43.464 --> 17:45.366
I don't mean anything by it.
I just mean...

17:46.076 --> 17:47.307
Have a good time.

17:52.897 --> 17:55.441
- I'm sorry I bothered you.
- You're fine.

18:03.511 --> 18:05.634
Ready, set... Hut!

18:13.887 --> 18:15.058
There it is.

18:16.253 --> 18:19.260
Hydrate!
Hustle over and hydrate!

18:19.261 --> 18:22.684
- Let's go. Five minutes, let's go!
- That's the way to play out there, son!

18:23.689 --> 18:27.358
Vince, you make me proud out there, son.
Keep it up, all right?

18:33.393 --> 18:36.680
All right, come on. let's catch some balls.
We'll run the fly patterns. Let's go.

18:36.681 --> 18:38.865
Just line up. Line up on the 40.

18:38.866 --> 18:41.967
That's it. Yeah, don't take no time off.
Keep it practice.

18:41.968 --> 18:44.920
- Run away, run away.
Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving.

18:46.638 --> 18:48.982
Ready, set... Hut!

18:53.484 --> 18:55.741
Hey, Deacon, you know Vince's dad?

18:56.313 --> 18:59.509
Yeah, back in the day I did.
You know he was in prison, right?

18:59.784 --> 19:02.049
Yeah. Yeah, what'd he do?

19:02.417 --> 19:03.874
Aggravated assault.

19:04.171 --> 19:07.764
He was a drug dealer. Used to be
one of the baddest cats we had in town.

19:09.027 --> 19:11.093
Aggravated assault
and drug dealing, huh?

19:11.525 --> 19:13.025
Yes, sir, but, coach...

19:13.824 --> 19:16.461
people... can change.

19:17.539 --> 19:20.257
If I didn't believe it, I wouldn't
be able to do the work that I do.

19:20.907 --> 19:23.019
If I didn't believe it,
I wouldn't even be alive.

19:27.980 --> 19:30.143
- I feel like a damn guidance counselor.
- Shoot.

19:30.144 --> 19:32.378
That Jess girl... she's got a temper too.

19:32.685 --> 19:35.968
- She's a strong girl.
- Strong? She scares me, is what she does.

19:36.894 --> 19:37.968
Next time you want to bring...

19:37.969 --> 19:40.569
intrigue and romance into my world,
do me a favor and don't.

19:40.569 --> 19:42.652
I think it's probably gonna
do y'all a lot of good.

19:42.653 --> 19:45.559
How long have you been helping this
Epyck girl? What kind of name is Epyck?

19:45.706 --> 19:47.791
Sounds like something someone
comes up with when they're drunk.

19:47.929 --> 19:50.296
You know the answers are in
the back of the book, don't you?

19:50.297 --> 19:51.514
I know, but...

19:51.515 --> 19:55.707
I can't teach her unless I understand it,
and I don't understand it.

19:55.708 --> 19:57.406
- I never understood this stuff.
- Honey, you have the answer,

19:57.407 --> 20:00.233
and then you got the beginning part.
All you got to do is fill in the middle.

20:00.234 --> 20:01.752
Oh, I'm so frustrated!

20:01.753 --> 20:03.453
Just do what you always do
and call your daughter up.

20:05.292 --> 20:08.259
That's a wonderful idea.
Julie is a whiz at math.

20:08.260 --> 20:09.693
Why didn't I think of that?

20:09.694 --> 20:12.878
- It's a good excuse to call her.
- That's what you've got me for.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.491
She was wonderful at math.

20:14.492 --> 20:16.340
She was great. She got A's.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.434
Shoot... machine.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.660
Bye. Thank you.

20:58.915 --> 21:01.389
- Don't you got anything to say to me?
- Hi.

21:02.331 --> 21:03.831
I wasn't thinking "hi."

21:04.321 --> 21:06.788
I was thinking more like, "I'm sorry
I just put you through all that crap."

21:06.789 --> 21:08.196
What did I put you through, Doreen?

21:08.197 --> 21:10.784
What did you put me through? How about
running off without saying a damn word?

21:10.785 --> 21:12.572
Hey... hey, she's here now.

21:12.573 --> 21:16.204
- Don't try to manage me, Bull.
- I'm not. I know you were. Beck, she was worried.

21:16.205 --> 21:20.019
Damn right! And I want to hear an apology
before she gets her selfish butt back in the house.

21:20.020 --> 21:21.891
Well, that's my house,
so I don't owe you anything.

21:21.892 --> 21:23.879
I'm sorry, ladies.
Is there a problem here?

21:23.880 --> 21:25.590
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a friend.

21:25.591 --> 21:28.210
- Well, good for you. We're her family.
- You are not my family.

21:28.211 --> 21:30.901
- I'm your dad, babe. Come on, let's go.
- You know, what? Let her go.

21:30.902 --> 21:33.022
- Becky, get back in the car.
- Get in the house. Get in the house!

21:33.023 --> 21:34.994
Why don't you get off
our property right now?

21:34.995 --> 21:36.460
Becky, get back in the car.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.476
- No, you want to touch her again?
- I decide where she lives!

21:39.477 --> 21:41.660
You touch her again, I'm calling the cops.

21:41.661 --> 21:44.745
- Call the cops. Call the cops.
- Get in the car. Get in the car.

21:44.746 --> 21:45.996
Dad, stop!

22:09.497 --> 22:10.977
Smooth, smooth.

22:11.779 --> 22:13.749
Good, smooth lifts, smooth lifts.

22:13.888 --> 22:16.519
- Hey, captains, you got the floor.
- Yes, sir.

22:18.115 --> 22:22.188
So, uh, who you taking to the dance?
I'm pretty sure you have options.

22:24.728 --> 22:27.419
Come on, Vince. It's not who you take.

22:28.426 --> 22:30.856
- It's who you take home.
- That's a good point.

22:30.857 --> 22:33.055
- Come on, you got two more.
- Okay, fellas!

22:33.132 --> 22:34.936
Where am I going tomorrow?
Any guesses?

22:35.357 --> 22:37.771
- Uh, Taylor Swift concert.
- Yes. No.

22:37.772 --> 22:40.359
Making sweet Dillon love
to a farm animal?

22:40.360 --> 22:41.525
No, but almost.

22:41.729 --> 22:44.542
Longhorns versus T.M.U.... 50-yard line.

22:44.641 --> 22:46.346
- All right! Yeah!
- Are you serious?

22:46.608 --> 22:48.708
Oh, wait! I got six tickets.

22:48.737 --> 22:51.135
I got six tickets
from the recruitment office...

22:51.136 --> 22:54.570
for anybody that wants to go.
I like pepperoni pizza.

22:54.571 --> 22:57.588
I like home-cooked meals.
Y'all know my favorite kinds of candy.

22:57.589 --> 23:00.023
- Oh, make it great!
- 50-yard line. You don't want to go, right?

23:00.024 --> 23:02.422
You know I'm there, you know I'm there.
You know I'm there, you know I'm there.

23:02.423 --> 23:03.679
50-yard line!

23:03.680 --> 23:06.221
So just to let you know,
the dance ends at midnight,

23:06.222 --> 23:08.429
but you have to stay until
the janitors lock up everything,

23:08.430 --> 23:10.583
so it's really gonna be 9:00 to 1:00.

23:11.497 --> 23:13.202
- 1:00 A.M.?
- Yeah.

23:13.692 --> 23:15.146
Okay.

23:15.147 --> 23:17.744
- 9:00 P.M. to 1:00 A.M.
- 9:00 P.M. to 1:00 A.M.

23:17.745 --> 23:20.294
- Okay.
- And I will be at homework club.

23:20.295 --> 23:23.188
Well, thank you.
I really do appreciate that so much.

23:23.189 --> 23:24.597
- No problem.
- Leave that there.

23:24.598 --> 23:26.317
Hey, honey. How's it going?

23:26.602 --> 23:28.762
Sun's making me dizzy.
Your Tiki people are over there.

23:28.763 --> 23:30.809
Oh, good, good.
I know they needed those.

23:31.061 --> 23:34.518
Catherine has kindly
volunteered for homework club!

23:34.519 --> 23:36.193
- Hooray!
- Oh, that's good. Thanks.

23:36.473 --> 23:40.085
And all I have to do is chaperone
at the dance tonight, which'll be...

23:40.728 --> 23:42.716
And I am so glad that that worked out.

23:42.717 --> 23:45.728
- Coach, I'll be seeing you later, okay?
- Thank you.

23:47.546 --> 23:49.449
We're supposed to have
our own little party tonight.

23:49.450 --> 23:51.601
We've got a babysitter set up. It's gonna be
you and me having our own little party.

23:51.602 --> 23:54.025
I know, I know, I know we were
gonna have our own little party,

23:54.026 --> 23:55.576
but now you're gonna have to
have a party by yourself, honey.

23:55.577 --> 23:57.195
What am I supposed to do home by myself?

23:57.196 --> 23:59.296
I can't even imagine
what you're gonna do by yourself. But...

23:59.801 --> 24:01.893
that's a math teacher, all right?

24:01.894 --> 24:05.481
It's the only way I can get these people
at the homework club... is to bribe them.

24:07.885 --> 24:09.735
- Have you eaten lunch yet?
- Nope.

24:10.002 --> 24:12.459
- Would you like to get some lunch?
- Yes, please.

24:12.569 --> 24:15.046
Oh, excuse me, girls.
Looks great!

24:15.914 --> 24:17.279
Ready, set...

24:17.909 --> 24:19.125
Hut!

24:22.506 --> 24:26.124
Come on, Tinker, get the lead out of
your ass and show me some effort, son!

24:26.125 --> 24:27.356
Let's go!

24:30.407 --> 24:32.876
What's the E.T.A. on that,
uh, new face mask for Lamas?

24:32.877 --> 24:35.682
It's bad enough the kid can't catch.
He ought to be able to see.

24:35.683 --> 24:37.601
Not for lack of effort.

24:38.476 --> 24:40.026
- What?
- Tinker.

24:40.620 --> 24:42.978
He's reacting to the snap count
instead of watching the ball.

24:42.979 --> 24:45.001
He's a half a second behind every time.

24:45.182 --> 24:46.443
Hut!

24:52.883 --> 24:54.133
Do something with that.

24:56.555 --> 24:57.956
Come on, now, let's go!

25:01.764 --> 25:03.797
I mean, I like filet mignon, but...

25:04.123 --> 25:06.289
dry aged porterhouse...

25:06.407 --> 25:09.081
is by far the superior cut.
What do you think?

25:09.701 --> 25:10.976
It's awesome.

25:12.423 --> 25:14.203
Tell me how it's going at school, Bud.

25:14.640 --> 25:15.975
Oh, it's going good.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.778
Swung by Mrs. Taylor's...

25:18.779 --> 25:20.714
office and talked about my schedule.

25:21.135 --> 25:22.706
- She's really nice.
- Yeah.

25:22.707 --> 25:24.130
She's got a really nice rack.

25:29.647 --> 25:32.479
There's some hot girls,
younger girls at school too.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.582
So after we finish eating,

25:34.583 --> 25:37.388
I'll drop you off at the school dance,
so you can meet someone.

25:38.536 --> 25:40.027
That's all right.

25:41.199 --> 25:43.780
- What?
- School dances are kind of lame.

25:44.970 --> 25:46.171
Yeah.

25:46.312 --> 25:47.512
They are, but...

25:48.048 --> 25:50.050
that's where...
that's where the girls are.

25:53.210 --> 25:54.722
What about you over there,

25:55.508 --> 25:58.182
number 5?
I don't see you eating my ham.

25:58.253 --> 25:59.647
I'm not too hungry.

26:00.833 --> 26:02.080
Okay.

26:02.554 --> 26:04.512
- Now, don't you have a dance tonight?
- Yep.

26:04.513 --> 26:05.692
Yeah?

26:06.493 --> 26:09.093
Hello? I know you're gonna
take Jess, right?

26:09.659 --> 26:12.685
- Yeah, I'm gonna meet her up there.
- Okay. Good.

26:16.289 --> 26:17.505
Hey.

26:18.484 --> 26:21.821
Hey, you remember, uh,
the first dance I ever took you to?

26:23.942 --> 26:25.351
Of course I do.

26:26.255 --> 26:27.905
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

26:28.272 --> 26:29.473
Your mama...

26:29.874 --> 26:32.766
was the prettiest girl
in the neighborhood, hands down,

26:32.885 --> 26:34.279
and still is.

26:36.275 --> 26:39.742
So I asked my boy Roland... I said,
"Roland, let me borrow your car, man,

26:39.743 --> 26:41.416
'cause you know I got
to take this girl out."

26:41.417 --> 26:44.219
See, I didn't know that. Roland?
We drove Roland's car?

26:44.220 --> 26:46.570
- Yeah, he said, "yeah," and gave me the keys.
- Oh, my God.

26:46.571 --> 26:48.457
Vince, we had to walk four
or five miles just to...

26:48.458 --> 26:50.343
make it to the dance
'cause the car broke down.

26:50.344 --> 26:52.413
Didn't tell me the gas gauge was broke.

26:52.414 --> 26:54.483
Damn car ran out of gas.

26:54.484 --> 26:56.508
It wasn't moving! I thought
it was on full the whole time.

26:56.509 --> 26:59.540
By the time we got to the dance, babe,
we was hot, sweaty, and stinky.

26:59.541 --> 27:01.422
- Four miles walking.
- Gas gauge.

27:01.423 --> 27:03.489
That was the best night
of my life, though.

27:05.933 --> 27:07.825
Now, those some good memories.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.807
Those are some good memories.

27:09.808 --> 27:11.743
See, I got... I got a different memory.

27:12.915 --> 27:14.424
I'm sorry, mama, but...

27:14.621 --> 27:17.743
the more I look at this man, the more
I remember him not being here.

27:18.595 --> 27:21.499
I remember taking care of my mama
when she was sick and strung out.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.783
- Vince, that's enough.
- Me. All right?

27:24.464 --> 27:27.219
Never called, you never wrote,

27:28.330 --> 27:30.091
missed birthdays.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.630
Pop, what's my birthday?

27:36.159 --> 27:38.920
You name it, you missed it.

27:41.014 --> 27:42.906
Look, I already said it, okay?

27:43.554 --> 27:44.726
I wasn't here.

27:45.616 --> 27:46.859
I'm sorry.

27:48.296 --> 27:51.144
But I thought about y'all, both of y'all.

27:51.708 --> 27:55.078
And I thought about everything
that... that I missed here.

27:56.615 --> 27:57.955
I'm here now.

27:59.440 --> 28:02.680
Can we do something different?
I want to make it better.

28:03.493 --> 28:04.703
You're good.

28:05.574 --> 28:07.029
Vince, that's enough.

28:07.310 --> 28:10.605
- You think you can put on some new clothes...
Vince, that's enough!

28:10.768 --> 28:13.149
Say some nice things,
all of a sudden you different?

28:14.380 --> 28:15.985
No, you the same man.

28:16.900 --> 28:19.039
- I should go, okay?
- Oh, no.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.678
Baby, thank you for dinner.
It was... it was great.

28:22.219 --> 28:23.502
It was great.

28:37.082 --> 28:38.266
Mama, don't...

29:06.613 --> 29:08.363
- Sharon.
- Hey.

29:08.925 --> 29:11.283
Do you, um... do you have my credit card?

29:11.284 --> 29:13.677
- No, sir, I don't.
- I thought I left it here.

29:13.678 --> 29:15.918
I did not see it yet. I checked for it.

29:17.226 --> 29:19.264
Well, here... did you see Buddy?

29:19.743 --> 29:21.301
Yeah. He headed out the front.

29:22.667 --> 29:23.860
Okay.

29:23.861 --> 29:26.075
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

29:46.852 --> 29:48.526
He's such a jerk.

29:50.085 --> 29:51.412
How do you know?

29:51.672 --> 29:52.864
Babe, I was there.

29:52.865 --> 29:55.137
His wife is such a redneck bitch too.

29:55.138 --> 29:58.638
So now he's gonna pay her off
so he doesn't have to be her dad anymore.

29:58.782 --> 30:01.226
Dad, I can't. Dad, I can't.

30:01.227 --> 30:02.684
I don't... I don't get it.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.509
- What?
- You know...

30:05.685 --> 30:07.872
I said that she could stay here for a few

30:07.873 --> 30:10.060
weeks, and you were
ready to rip my head off.

30:10.061 --> 30:12.431
And now she's gonna
stay here indefinitely?

30:13.117 --> 30:15.160
She needs a role model, and I...

30:15.161 --> 30:19.221
think, unfortunately,
in this circumstance,
we happen to be the role models.

30:19.591 --> 30:20.607
Really?

30:20.608 --> 30:23.675
Oh, I swear to God, if you ever
accidentally bump into her in the shower,

30:23.676 --> 30:26.064
- ...I'm gonna stab you in the face.
- Hey, hey. Hey, honey.

30:26.065 --> 30:27.242
Come here.

30:27.536 --> 30:30.483
- Really?
- No? No, okay. All right.

30:31.938 --> 30:34.322
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:36.252 --> 30:40.129
He said that since I'm not coming home
that they're gonna go back to Seattle.

30:41.778 --> 30:42.950
Good.

30:43.054 --> 30:44.772
Let them go. You stay here.

30:46.029 --> 30:48.170
I will babysit for you.

30:48.278 --> 30:52.591
- I will do the dishes. I will clean the house.
- Shut up. No. You just stay here, okay?

30:53.939 --> 30:55.527
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

30:56.240 --> 30:58.452
You have no idea
how much this means to me.

30:58.453 --> 31:00.780
Hey, just stay with us.
You're gonna be okay.

31:01.105 --> 31:02.323
I know.

31:02.855 --> 31:03.945
You're gonna be okay.

31:05.022 --> 31:08.088
I just don't understand this boy.
It makes no sense.

31:09.580 --> 31:11.472
Do you know any of his friends?

31:12.842 --> 31:17.038
He just moved back. He doesn't really have
any friends, especially at East Dillon.

31:17.451 --> 31:19.365
Do you know yet where you want to go?

31:19.482 --> 31:22.135
No, Eric! I don't know where to go.
Just give me a second.

31:22.136 --> 31:26.002
I mean, I don't know this boy,
so I don't have any idea where he might go.

31:26.003 --> 31:27.193
All right.

31:27.538 --> 31:29.769
I mean, I was talking
to him the other day.

31:29.770 --> 31:32.001
I started talking to him
about football, you know?

31:32.002 --> 31:34.923
And I said, "well, maybe, you know,
you can go out and play football,

31:34.924 --> 31:37.486
then you'll meet some people,
and you'll get reacquainted." And he goes,

31:37.487 --> 31:41.064
"Aw, dad, I don't like football.
It's a stupid game."

31:43.168 --> 31:44.603
Can you believe that?

31:49.558 --> 31:50.816
Can he play?

31:53.096 --> 31:55.396
Of course can play. He's a Garrity.

31:55.851 --> 31:57.301
It's in his blood.

31:58.879 --> 32:00.202
He loves football.

32:00.633 --> 32:02.394
He just doesn't know it yet.

32:31.295 --> 32:33.765
Wait, what's going on here?

32:35.792 --> 32:37.249
Drunk dance.

32:50.552 --> 32:51.735
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:51.736 --> 32:52.906
Nice shirt.

32:52.907 --> 32:55.111
Well, at the goodwill. 99 cents,

32:55.112 --> 32:57.903
pulled it out, put it on, fit like a glove.

32:57.904 --> 32:59.935
A magical shirt at a bargain price.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.887
- I'm impressed.
- Well, that was the point.

33:01.888 --> 33:03.867
I was trying to impress you.

33:03.868 --> 33:05.114
Oh, really?

33:05.851 --> 33:07.201
You are so pretty.

33:10.197 --> 33:11.784
You hear about T.M.U.?

33:11.834 --> 33:14.575
They're inviting me down there. I'm gonna go
and check it out tomorrow with some of the guys.

33:14.576 --> 33:15.685
- That's awesome!
- Yeah, it is.

33:15.686 --> 33:17.954
- You're gonna knock them dead.
- I got to tell you something.

33:18.155 --> 33:20.232
- Okay.
- You like me.

33:22.710 --> 33:24.890
- Is that right?
- Yeah, you do.

33:25.832 --> 33:27.750
And I'm gonna take you out sometime...

33:27.751 --> 33:29.469
just letting you know,

33:30.270 --> 33:32.599
because I'm coming for you, Sproles.

33:33.577 --> 33:35.596
Get ready, 'cause I'm coming for you.

33:43.086 --> 33:45.678
How was the dinner with your dad?
How'd that go?

33:45.679 --> 33:47.524
Jess, I really
don't want to talk about it...

33:48.700 --> 33:50.343
- ...right now.
- That's cool.

33:51.246 --> 33:52.460
That's cool.

33:54.201 --> 33:56.663
You know, if you want to leave, like,
we could probably still make that movie.

33:56.664 --> 33:59.078
Jess, I don't want you working
on the team anymore.

33:59.252 --> 34:01.284
- Huh?
- In the locker room...

34:01.472 --> 34:03.626
doing laundry, moving weights. I...

34:03.627 --> 34:06.272
Yeah. We're still... working it out.

34:06.273 --> 34:08.337
No, no, no, that's the thing.
I don't want to work it out.

34:08.376 --> 34:10.840
I want to take my team
to a state championship,

34:10.841 --> 34:14.034
and it's really hard to do that when I got to
check my teammates about you in the locker room.

34:14.034 --> 34:17.079
- Okay, don't check your teammates about me.
- So what am I supposed to do?

34:17.080 --> 34:20.304
- You're supposed to treat me like one of the boys.
- Okay, great. Then you call me dramatic...

34:20.306 --> 34:22.284
and macho-chismo
when I stand up for you...

34:22.302 --> 34:24.503
- It's machismo.
- Whatever, all right?

34:24.504 --> 34:26.705
You know what I mean.
You're making me look like a chump.

34:26.706 --> 34:28.297
Make you...?

34:28.591 --> 34:30.433
Everything's about Vince.

34:30.434 --> 34:33.782
You want me to be there for you
all summer long, help you with your football,

34:33.783 --> 34:37.484
but I can't be a part of the game
in the way that I think it's interesting.

34:37.485 --> 34:40.386
You know, maybe I'm looking
for stuff for my college career.

34:40.387 --> 34:42.205
This'll look good on my transcript.

34:45.377 --> 34:46.877
You look great tonight.

34:51.980 --> 34:53.715
Just sell me the frickin' ticket!

34:53.716 --> 34:56.065
I can't sell them tickets
if they don't have I.D.s.

34:56.067 --> 34:58.951
I have an I.D.! I have money!
What's the problem?

34:58.952 --> 35:01.376
- They don't go to this school.
- What's confusing? They're with me!

35:01.377 --> 35:02.910
Hey, Epyck, how are ya?

35:02.911 --> 35:05.048
Tami, nobody here has a student I.D.

35:05.049 --> 35:08.658
I have a student I.D. How many times do
I got to show you my I.D. and the money?

35:08.659 --> 35:10.752
- Epyck, you're suspended.
- 'Cause of you!

35:10.753 --> 35:13.486
I'd be getting into this freakin' dance
if you wouldn't have ratted me out.

35:13.754 --> 35:15.662
You know what? You're suspended.

35:16.198 --> 35:19.333
Y'all don't have IDs.
No smoking, please.

35:19.334 --> 35:21.422
- I need you to leave.
- What is your problem with me?

35:21.423 --> 35:25.063
I don't have a problem with you! You need
to pay attention to the rules, period!

35:29.562 --> 35:31.497
This is lame, let's go.
I'm out of here, man.

35:33.170 --> 35:35.192
Enjoy your stupid dance.

35:36.184 --> 35:37.429
She's...

35:37.962 --> 35:39.875
a demon from hell.

35:59.221 --> 36:00.835
I came here...

36:01.074 --> 36:04.153
to tell you that the whole thing
between you and me...

36:16.237 --> 36:18.172
Hey, hey, hey, there it is right there.
Pull in, pull in!

36:18.341 --> 36:19.972
That's my black truck right there.

36:21.643 --> 36:23.067
There he is right there.

36:23.558 --> 36:25.319
- There he is.
- Yeah, that's him.

36:25.320 --> 36:28.351
- All right, now, listen, take it easy.
- All right, all right. Stop, stop, stop.

36:28.858 --> 36:31.791
Hey, Buddy!
What do you think you're doing?

36:31.792 --> 36:33.380
- You stop right now, young man!
- Buddy!

36:33.381 --> 36:36.393
- Hey, stop right now! You stop right now!
- Buddy... Buddy!

36:36.676 --> 36:39.315
You get over here!
Don't you run, don't you run!

36:39.345 --> 36:41.422
You do not run from me, boy!
You listen to me!

36:41.617 --> 36:43.800
- Come down now!
- Get off of me!

36:44.082 --> 36:47.046
- Stop it! Don't make me hurt you!
- Don't make me hurt you!

36:47.047 --> 36:50.219
- Son, listen to me! Stop it, son!
- What's your problem?

36:50.220 --> 36:52.981
- You are gonna shape up, young man!
- Who are you?

36:53.056 --> 36:54.457
I am your dad!

37:03.844 --> 37:05.649
How can I help you, son?

37:41.128 --> 37:42.790
What the hell you doing, boy?

37:43.971 --> 37:45.950
I'm just checking, that's all.

37:46.842 --> 37:48.428
Checking for what?

37:51.947 --> 37:53.534
Go ahead, check away.

37:54.142 --> 37:57.382
You ain't gonna find nothing, but keep on.
Check... check as much as you want.

37:57.546 --> 37:59.699
Look... make sure you look at everything.

38:08.276 --> 38:10.124
Found what you're looking for?

38:12.054 --> 38:14.033
Tell me you're done with the drugs.

38:14.537 --> 38:15.736
Swear to me.

38:17.519 --> 38:18.731
I swear.

38:22.275 --> 38:23.689
You got to promise me...

38:24.708 --> 38:26.426
that you won't let mom ever...

38:27.362 --> 38:29.123
ever touch that stuff again.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.395
Look...

38:40.029 --> 38:42.372
I will never, ever...

38:43.225 --> 38:45.569
let that happen again. You hear me?

38:47.152 --> 38:48.696
On my life.

38:57.034 --> 39:00.172
October 9, 1993, pop.

39:07.270 --> 39:09.115
- Spivey, you got special teams?
- Oh, yeah.

39:09.116 --> 39:11.660
Well, that's offense. What about defense?

39:12.336 --> 39:14.141
Coach, we got no effort out there.

39:14.623 --> 39:17.082
Tinker's getting pancaked in practice.

39:17.163 --> 39:18.563
Well, you know, actually, uh...

39:18.662 --> 39:22.266
I think what he's doing is
reacting to the snap count and not, uh...

39:23.272 --> 39:24.816
not watching the ball.

39:25.213 --> 39:28.235
It's making him, like,
a half second late every single play.

39:31.193 --> 39:33.380
Well, good. Fix it.

39:33.903 --> 39:35.130
Yes, sir.

39:37.263 --> 39:40.590
Fellas, if you excuse me,
I got a tryout I got to attend to here.

39:41.140 --> 39:43.588
- Jess, how you doing?
- I'm great, coach.

39:57.584 --> 39:59.023
Hurry. Hustle up.

40:00.221 --> 40:01.384
That a boy.

40:02.209 --> 40:03.469
Here he is, coach.

40:04.270 --> 40:05.863
Ready to do what it takes.

40:09.172 --> 40:11.151
You know what a three-point stance is?

40:11.156 --> 40:12.656
- No.
- No, sir.

40:13.168 --> 40:14.168
No, sir.

40:14.169 --> 40:17.257
I suppose you don't know
what a stunt is either, then.

40:17.258 --> 40:19.569
- No, sir.
- He's a quick learner, Eric.

40:21.958 --> 40:23.545
We know you can run.

40:24.271 --> 40:27.828
Two things. One... you don't take your
helmet off when you're standing on my field.

40:27.829 --> 40:29.347
You're standing on my field.

40:31.019 --> 40:33.163
Just get down there around the 20 or so.

40:34.077 --> 40:35.882
Let's see you run the 40.

40:36.605 --> 40:38.694
- You know what that means, yeah?
- Yeah.

40:38.695 --> 40:40.413
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
