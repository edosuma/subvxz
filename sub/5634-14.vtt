<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.133 --> 00:11.762
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.845 --> 00:14.765
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.848 --> 00:18.143
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.227 --> 00:21.647
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>Positively can do</i>

00:21.730 --> 00:23.148
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.232 --> 00:24.775
<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:30.113
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:35.202 --> 00:38.247
- <i> We now return</i>
- Creep Space Nine.

00:44.336 --> 00:45.712
- Aah! She saw us!

00:45.796 --> 00:47.422
Warp speed!

00:47.506 --> 00:50.217
Hey, you guys, you know
that song<i> Jimmy Crack Corn?</i>

00:50.300 --> 00:52.469
Yeah, it's me and Lois's
wedding song... what about it?

00:52.553 --> 00:55.264
Well, the whole time the
guy's saying he doesn't care

00:55.347 --> 00:58.141
that, uh, this Jimmy
fella cracked the corn,

00:58.225 --> 01:00.686
but yet he wrote an entire song about it.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.729
Cared enough to put pen to paper.

01:02.813 --> 01:05.232
- Are you on vacation?
- I am.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.483
Here's those fries you ordered.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.318
And your hot sauce.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.320
Hot sauce? On fries?

01:10.404 --> 01:11.697
Mm-hmm, oh, yeah.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.866
Black guys put hot sauce on everything,

01:13.949 --> 01:16.034
on account of most of us
been pepper-sprayed

01:16.118 --> 01:17.703
by the time we're two.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.289
Can't taste nothing unless
you got that burn on there.

01:20.372 --> 01:22.916
This stuff ain't that hot.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.084
Whoo!

01:24.168 --> 01:25.419
I feel like I'm crying,

01:25.502 --> 01:27.629
but, like, out of my neck and back.

01:27.713 --> 01:28.881
Look at his face.

01:28.964 --> 01:31.258
He looks like Oliver Platt
climbing a flight of stairs.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.218
Hey! That's a low blow.

01:33.302 --> 01:34.970
I'm gonna call the network and complain.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.180
Where's the phone?

01:36.263 --> 01:38.182
It's upstairs, Oliver!

01:38.265 --> 01:39.975
Eh, they know what they did.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.143
Tell you what, Peter.

01:41.226 --> 01:44.188
I'll give you 10 bucks if you drink
an entire shot glass of that hot sauce.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.522
Let me see the money.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.232
You-you don't believe I have 10 dollars?

01:47.316 --> 01:48.525
I think he's afraid.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.110
- Am not!
- Prove it.

01:50.194 --> 01:52.154
- Ten bucks.
- All right.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.156
This is for all the teachers who told me

01:54.239 --> 01:56.033
I'd never amount to nothing.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.079
Oh, my God!

02:06.585 --> 02:09.296
That last one was more <i>caliente</i> than hot.

02:09.379 --> 02:10.589
But still, holy crap!

02:10.672 --> 02:12.007
Well, here's your money.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.133
This is awesome!

02:13.217 --> 02:16.553
I can get people to pay me 10 bucks
just for doing stupid stuff?

02:16.637 --> 02:19.306
Man, I haven't made money this easy
since I invented the Yanket!

02:19.473 --> 02:21.308
Peter, what's wrong?

02:21.433 --> 02:24.269
Well, I want to masturbate,
but I'm just so darn cold.

02:24.353 --> 02:26.813
Too bad there's no answer
for that problem.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.273
But now there is.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.567
Hi, I'm Peter Griffin,
creator of the Yanket.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.194
If you're anything like me,

02:32.277 --> 02:33.570
the number one problem in your life

02:33.654 --> 02:35.531
is that you can't masturbate
just anywhere.

02:35.614 --> 02:37.199
But now you can.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.992
Introducing the Yanket,

02:39.076 --> 02:41.787
the only blanket with built-in decoy arms.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.289
Our patented process
makes it look like you're...

02:44.373 --> 02:45.707
<i>holding the remote</i>

02:45.791 --> 02:47.376
<i>or sipping a beer.</i>

02:47.459 --> 02:48.544
<i>Meanwhile, your real hands</i>

02:48.627 --> 02:50.379
<i>are under the blanket,</i><i>going to town.</i>

02:50.462 --> 02:52.339
Peter, what are you doing?

02:52.422 --> 02:55.551
Nothing. Let's watch
a Scarlett Johansson movie.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.010
But wait, there's more!

03:03.475 --> 03:05.936
Hey, what's going on under that blanket?

03:06.019 --> 03:07.271
You'll never know.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.862
All right, you guys.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.530
I will now do anything for 10 dollars.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.865
Who's got something for me?

03:17.948 --> 03:19.575
I got one. I'll give you 10 bucks

03:19.658 --> 03:21.535
if you wear the same pair
of underwear for a month.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.370
Pay up.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.830
Uh, actually, you owe me $20.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.040
Ew. Here's $50, go change your underwear.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.876
It won't come off.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.840
Hey, Peter, you want
to earn another 10 bucks?

03:34.965 --> 03:37.217
- Course I do.
- Great, I got a hilarious one.

03:37.301 --> 03:40.262
I'll give you 10 dollars
for your L4 vertebrae.

03:43.974 --> 03:47.561
So, uh, I guess this means
Peter, you're our Joe now,

03:47.644 --> 03:49.188
and Joe, you're our Peter.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.522
That means you got to do
anything for 10 bucks.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.649
- Okay.
- I have a request.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.985
Yay! Joe's chin!

03:59.364 --> 04:02.117
Hey, Peter, I just
thought of something else

04:02.201 --> 04:03.994
you could do for 10 bucks.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.662
Yeah, you know... you know what?

04:05.746 --> 04:07.331
I... I'm, uh, think I'm gonna,

04:07.414 --> 04:09.499
um, upping my price to $12.50.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.960
No, you ca... no, you're locked in at 10.

04:12.044 --> 04:14.588
Yeah, no renegotiating!

04:14.671 --> 04:16.215
It was a joke.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.884
Shut u... Just-just point me to the thing.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.386
All right, we're gonna open
this fire hydrant

04:21.470 --> 04:25.349
and you're gonna drink as
much water from it as you can.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.142
Chris has Crohn's disease.

04:27.226 --> 04:28.352
Get down there.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.686
Don't-don't-don't tell us that now.

04:32.981 --> 04:36.777
I think this is how
Anna Nicole Smith died.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.612
Don't make light of that.

04:44.660 --> 04:45.744
Holy crap!

04:45.827 --> 04:47.496
We-we-we got to get out of here!

04:48.372 --> 04:51.375
Aw, man, the library.

04:53.252 --> 04:54.503
<i>White Fang?</i>

04:54.586 --> 04:57.214
This is for ruining
my eighth grade summer!

05:09.059 --> 05:10.060
Aah!

05:11.270 --> 05:13.355
He ruined my summer, too.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.029
Oh, hey, Bri.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.614
Still sitting in chairs, huh?

05:22.698 --> 05:24.241
What'd your back ever do to you?

05:24.324 --> 05:25.617
I'm trying to watch.

05:25.701 --> 05:27.411
Know what I'm watching? My core.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.247
Your body and mind are supposed
to be on the same team.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.210
Sitting on the hard floor's
good for your back, too.

05:35.294 --> 05:38.422
female high school teacher
sleeps with her students.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.340
Is she hot? Stay tuned.

05:40.424 --> 05:43.427
But first, the public library
suffered damage this evening

05:43.510 --> 05:45.095
when an area fat man

05:45.179 --> 05:46.430
smashed through the front of the building

05:46.513 --> 05:48.015
while attempting a drunken stunt.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.642
The bus station is expected
to absorb the overflow

05:50.726 --> 05:52.769
of homeless armpit-washing ladies.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.229
Oh, God.

05:54.313 --> 05:56.690
Peter, is there something
you want to tell me?

05:56.773 --> 05:59.234
Uh, yeah, every light in the house is on.

05:59.318 --> 06:00.861
Did you destroy the library?

06:00.944 --> 06:02.821
Did I destroy the library?

06:02.905 --> 06:04.031
Ha, no, Lois.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.282
That was television.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.825
In light of events at the library,

06:06.909 --> 06:08.619
we now go live to a press conference

06:08.702 --> 06:09.995
at the mayor's residence.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.330
Good evening, Quahog.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.415
I'm here tonight with the deputy mayor.

06:13.498 --> 06:14.875
Hi, everybody!

06:14.958 --> 06:16.710
Shut. Up.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.255
Anyway, these types
of immature, drunken high-jinks

06:20.339 --> 06:22.090
are destroying our town.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.425
And if we can't trust

06:23.509 --> 06:26.470
a 42-year-old man to drink responsibly,

06:26.553 --> 06:29.139
then I have no choice but to take action.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.724
So, as mayor of Quahog,

06:30.807 --> 06:34.061
I hereby raise the town's
legal drinking age to 50.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.479
What?

06:35.562 --> 06:36.605
I can't drink anymore?

06:36.688 --> 06:38.023
What am I gonna do?

06:38.106 --> 06:39.816
What do people do who don't drink?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.318
I don't know. Knit?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.737
Knit? Knit?
Are you kidding me?

06:43.862 --> 06:44.905
Maybe.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.532
Um, okay, so it turns out

06:46.615 --> 06:48.367
I am, like, crazy good at knitting.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.500
<i>Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

06:56.583 --> 06:59.711
It's day three of Quahog's
new ban on alcohol

06:59.795 --> 07:01.129
for anybody under 50.

07:01.213 --> 07:02.464
And if there's one thing

07:02.548 --> 07:03.841
the new drinking age law has done,

07:03.924 --> 07:06.552
it's let us know that women
tell terrible stories.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.470
Good to see your eyes open, Tom.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.222
For more on this story,
we now go to Tricia Takanawa.

07:10.389 --> 07:11.515
Tricia?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.308
Joyce, I'm standing here

07:13.392 --> 07:15.060
on the streets of Quahog,

07:15.143 --> 07:16.979
where citizens are feeling the effects

07:17.062 --> 07:18.730
of the city's new drinking law.

07:18.814 --> 07:21.358
I was going to bone my girlfriend,

07:21.441 --> 07:22.943
but she told me that if

07:23.026 --> 07:25.195
there wasn't vanilla vodka involved,

07:25.279 --> 07:27.489
there was no way.

07:27.573 --> 07:30.325
I think we just have to trust
our elected officials...

07:30.409 --> 07:33.287
and Goldman's Pharmacy
is fully stocked on cough syrup,

07:33.370 --> 07:35.372
which goes great with ginger ale.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.165
Well, I do miss drinking,

07:37.249 --> 07:39.543
but I have used the time
to reconnect with my children

07:39.626 --> 07:42.921
and I'm actually thinking about
resuming my actuarial practice.

07:43.005 --> 07:45.591
Oh, my God, he's just
been drunk this whole time?

07:45.674 --> 07:47.134
This new law sucks.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.094
And I got to say, it was kind of uncool

07:49.178 --> 07:51.013
of Mayor West to call it "Peter's Law."

07:51.096 --> 07:52.431
No kidding.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.391
Now I know how Megan
from "Megan's Law" felt.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.519
I... I don't... I don't think
you know how she felt.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.983
I don't know why I didn't
think of this before, guys.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.401
We'll just go into the brewery

08:04.484 --> 08:05.944
after hours and take some beer.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.988
- Hey, buddy.
- It's okay, I work here.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.407
Aren't you the guy who
cried in that meeting?

08:10.490 --> 08:12.367
Oh, yeah, you know...
you know, I just remembered,

08:12.451 --> 08:15.204
there's no beer here, l-let's-
let's just, let's just go.

08:17.539 --> 08:20.000
Peter, why'd you want me
to get us into this prison?

08:20.083 --> 08:22.377
Because, Joe, everyone
knows that all prisoners

08:22.461 --> 08:24.588
make bootleg wine in their toilet.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.381
We are gonna get so wasted!

08:26.465 --> 08:27.758
Oh! Look, right here.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.092
This one's full of Chardonnay.

08:30.135 --> 08:31.261
Peter, I don't think that's...

08:31.345 --> 08:32.971
<i>But it was Chardonnay.</i>

08:33.055 --> 08:35.599
<i>The best Chardonnay</i>
<i>I'd ever had in my life.</i>

08:35.682 --> 08:38.393
<i>The man who made it,</i>
<i>Curtis "Murder Dog" Williams,</i>

08:38.477 --> 08:40.229
<i>went on to become</i>

08:40.312 --> 08:42.022
<i>one of America's</i><i>most celebrated vintners.</i>

08:42.105 --> 08:44.441
<i>Hey, Joe here.</i>
<i>Peter's lying.</i>

08:44.525 --> 08:45.943
<i>He drank pee-pee.</i>

08:48.737 --> 08:50.030
Don't worry, guys.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.573
If we can't buy alcohol in Quahog,

08:51.657 --> 08:53.075
we'll just go to the next town over.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.745
Sorry, in this town,
you can only buy alcohol

08:56.828 --> 08:58.622
if you're dressed head-to-toe in jeans.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.082
What? Who made that law?

09:00.165 --> 09:01.458
Our mayor, Jay Leno.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.961
Have you seen some of these laws
they've got now about denim?

09:04.044 --> 09:05.629
You know, I say,

09:05.712 --> 09:07.673
if you don't like it,
you may as well Levi's.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.550
Who's voting for these mayors?

09:09.633 --> 09:12.636
Rhode Island's a mess from top to bottom.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.641
I tell you, guys,

09:17.724 --> 09:19.184
getting alcohol when you're underage

09:19.268 --> 09:21.186
isn't as easy as Obama's
daughters make it look.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.521
What? Is that true?

09:22.604 --> 09:23.647
I don't know.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.691
Hey, isn't that your dog at the bar?

09:25.774 --> 09:27.776
Hey, Jerome, one more, neat.

09:29.611 --> 09:30.696
What the hell?

09:30.779 --> 09:32.614
Why's Jerome serving booze to Brian?

09:32.698 --> 09:33.866
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

09:33.949 --> 09:36.410
Come here, boy! Come on!

09:36.493 --> 09:38.036
Hey, what's up?
We going for a ride in the car?

09:38.120 --> 09:39.663
No, no, I had a question for you.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.582
Don't ever do that

09:41.665 --> 09:43.417
unless you have a car ride to offer.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.793
Hey, how come you're allowed to drink?

09:44.877 --> 09:45.919
Yeah, you're not 50.

09:46.003 --> 09:47.212
Uh, actually, I am.

09:47.296 --> 09:49.006
I'm 56 in dog years.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.633
Oh, is that why you got white pubic hair?

09:51.717 --> 09:53.802
I'll thank you not
to check out my pubic hair.

09:53.886 --> 09:55.679
Well, then don't go flashing it around.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.723
Put on some underpants, you crazy old man.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.850
Peter, I think you're missing the point.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.643
Brian can buy us booze.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.437
Oh, my God, you're right!

10:03.520 --> 10:04.897
W-Would you do that for us, Brian?

10:04.980 --> 10:07.149
- Sure, why not?
- Aw, thank God.

10:07.232 --> 10:08.483
'Cause just sitting here all sober

10:08.567 --> 10:10.527
is more boring than watching a pot boil.

10:10.611 --> 10:11.820
Hey, you.

10:11.904 --> 10:13.864
- What are you doing?
- I like to watch.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.574
I want to watch you boil.

10:15.657 --> 10:16.909
I can't do it with you watching.

10:16.992 --> 10:18.702
Oh, not even if I do this?

10:18.785 --> 10:21.246
Don't do that...
Oh, God, that's so hot.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.581
Oh, yeah?

10:22.664 --> 10:23.957
Then why don't I take your top off?

10:24.041 --> 10:25.125
Oh! Oh...

10:25.209 --> 10:26.585
I'm boiling! I'm boiling!

10:26.668 --> 10:27.711
Yeah.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.880
Now I'm gonna stick my raw pasta in you.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.465
Peter, what's going on in there?

10:31.548 --> 10:32.925
Making dinner, babe.

10:33.008 --> 10:34.510
<i>Brass Monkey</i>

10:34.593 --> 10:37.095
<i>That funky monkey</i>

10:37.179 --> 10:38.680
<i>Brass Monkey junkie</i>

10:38.764 --> 10:41.475
<i>That funky monkey, Brass...</i>

10:41.558 --> 10:43.519
<i>Got this dance that's more than real</i>

10:43.602 --> 10:45.354
<i>Drink Brass Monkey</i>
<i>Here's how you feel</i>

10:45.437 --> 10:46.980
<i>You put your left leg down,</i>
<i>your right leg up</i>

10:47.064 --> 10:48.941
<i>Tilt your head back</i>
<i>Let's finish the cup</i>

10:49.024 --> 10:51.902
<i>MCA with the bottle D rocks the can</i>

10:51.985 --> 10:54.196
<i>Ad-Rock gets nice with Charlie Chan</i>

10:54.279 --> 10:55.948
<i>We're offered Moet</i>
<i>We don't mind Chivas</i>

10:56.031 --> 10:57.699
<i>Wherever we go,</i>
<i>we bring the Monkey with us</i>

10:57.783 --> 10:59.284
<i>Ad-Rock drinks three Mike D is D</i>

10:59.368 --> 11:00.786
<i>Double R foots the bill</i>
<i>most definitely</i>

11:00.869 --> 11:02.996
<i>I drink Brass Monkey and I rock well</i>

11:03.080 --> 11:05.499
<i>I got a castle in Brooklyn,</i>
<i>that's where I dwell</i>

11:05.582 --> 11:07.668
<i>Brass Monkey</i>

11:10.212 --> 11:12.297
Hey, hey, Brian, Brian.

11:12.381 --> 11:13.966
How would you like to build,

11:14.049 --> 11:17.177
build a deck, right now, with your buddy?

11:17.261 --> 11:19.346
'Cause we got hammers...

11:19.429 --> 11:20.639
the whole deal.

11:20.722 --> 11:21.974
I don't know, man. It's pretty dark out.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.350
That's okay.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.601
I'll just pull my car around

11:24.685 --> 11:26.728
and point the headlights at it.

11:26.812 --> 11:30.232
Did you know that my dad
once called me a mistake?

11:30.315 --> 11:31.775
That's messed up, man.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.151
Wow.

11:33.235 --> 11:35.112
You know, Brian, hanging out with you

11:35.195 --> 11:37.406
this past week has been awesome.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.616
Yeah, why don't we,
why don't we do this anymore?

11:39.700 --> 11:42.452
We-we-we used to do fun stuff
all the time, you know?

11:42.536 --> 11:44.413
It used to be you and me.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.707
And it always will be, pal.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.000
Hey, listen, listen.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.794
I want you to be Meg's godfather.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.212
No, thanks, Peter.

11:52.296 --> 11:54.798
But this here, we got to keep this going.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.592
I agree, buddy, I agree.

11:56.675 --> 11:59.887
All right, I'm gonna go barf
down the garbage disposal.

12:01.305 --> 12:02.723
Brian, I think we can get John Mayer

12:02.806 --> 12:04.683
to stop tweeting again,
but we all got to work together.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.810
Oh, my God! Are you drunk again?

12:06.894 --> 12:09.479
Yeah, I was, I was just hanging
out with my main man, Peter.

12:09.563 --> 12:10.814
"Main man"?

12:10.898 --> 12:12.399
"Hanging out"?

12:12.482 --> 12:14.651
Brian, he's only using you to buy alcohol!

12:14.735 --> 12:15.777
What? What are, wha...?

12:15.861 --> 12:17.279
What are you, what are you talking about?

12:17.362 --> 12:19.239
It hasn't dawned on you
that he only started

12:19.323 --> 12:21.575
spending time with you when
the drinking age was raised?

12:21.658 --> 12:23.202
Come on, that's, that's not true.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.956
Aw, shoot, I puked
in the clean dishes side.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.209
Trust me, as soon as you're
no longer of use to him,

12:30.292 --> 12:31.418
he'll be done with you.

12:31.502 --> 12:32.836
Oh, I get it, I get it.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.379
Okay, you're, you're jealous

12:34.463 --> 12:36.298
'cause I'm spending
all my time with Peter.

12:36.381 --> 12:37.799
Oh, yeah. Yeah, right.

12:37.883 --> 12:40.719
Yeah, where's my dumb,
morbidly obese friend?

12:40.802 --> 12:42.054
Hey, Stewie, get in here!

12:42.137 --> 12:44.681
I'm being an '80s computer hacker!

12:44.765 --> 12:47.643
Come on, baby, show me what you got.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.853
And we... are in!

12:49.937 --> 12:51.188
All right, I better go.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.107
I got to go tell him
"This isn't a game, man."

12:54.191 --> 12:56.026
Brian, do you have any idea why Peter

12:56.109 --> 12:57.611
was trying to climb in the dishwasher?

12:57.694 --> 12:59.821
I thought it was a Tokyo apartment.

12:59.905 --> 13:01.823
Sorry, Lois, we, uh, we got...

13:01.907 --> 13:03.075
I guess we had a little too much to drink.

13:03.158 --> 13:04.618
"To drink"?

13:04.701 --> 13:06.286
It's against the law for him to do that!

13:06.370 --> 13:07.663
Was Stewie in here?

13:07.746 --> 13:10.832
Was, was he in here?
I... I smell his cologne.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.042
Listen to me, Brian.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.460
No more booze in this house.

13:13.544 --> 13:15.629
You're gonna get us all in trouble.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.339
Peter, we... maybe we should find

13:17.422 --> 13:19.007
some place else to get... to drink.

13:19.091 --> 13:21.426
Yeah, I think you're right.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.763
Hi, we're here from the '80s FBI.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.682
Somebody here with a 2,400-baud modem

13:26.765 --> 13:28.475
almost started World War III.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.020
Oop, sounds like they're making an escape.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.901
Hey, you want to see me run up that slide?

13:37.985 --> 13:40.237
Sure.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.156
Ow, damn it!

13:43.240 --> 13:45.784
I think my belt buckle cut my gut!

13:45.868 --> 13:47.911
Hey, Peter, can I ask you something?

13:47.995 --> 13:49.955
You're not just hanging out
with me because I,

13:50.038 --> 13:52.124
I can buy you alcohol, right?

13:52.207 --> 13:54.459
What? Course not. We're friends.

13:54.543 --> 13:56.753
Yeah, no, I-I know. That's,
that's, that's what I thought.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.338
And also you bring me dead birds.

13:58.422 --> 13:59.715
I know Lois gets mad about it,

13:59.798 --> 14:01.925
but I like using them to point at things.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.594
Hey, did they move the bagels?

14:03.677 --> 14:04.970
- Yeah, they're right there.
- Oh, my God!

14:05.053 --> 14:06.471
What the hell is that?

14:06.555 --> 14:08.974
This? This is a pointing bird.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.767
All right, I just saw a sprinkler come on,

14:10.851 --> 14:12.853
so I'm gonna go bite
at the water a little bit.

14:14.188 --> 14:16.190
Hey, what's going on here?

14:16.273 --> 14:18.942
Uh, some butthorn's
shining a flashlight on me.

14:19.026 --> 14:21.111
I meant prior to me coming
up and investigating this.

14:21.195 --> 14:22.696
Oh, well, you got to be clearer, man.

14:22.779 --> 14:23.906
I'm wasted.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.324
Sir, I'm gonna need to see some I.D.

14:25.407 --> 14:26.783
You look underage.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.994
Just as I suspected.
You're a minor.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.621
It ain't my fault!

14:30.704 --> 14:32.331
Somebody's been buying it
for me and all my friends!

14:32.414 --> 14:33.624
Oh, is that right?

14:33.707 --> 14:35.959
Well, you better tell me who that is
or you're in a lot of trouble.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.503
Hey, is this the park where Boner died?

14:37.586 --> 14:38.837
Wait, wha-what's going on?

14:38.921 --> 14:40.088
That's him, Officer!

14:40.172 --> 14:41.590
That's who's been buying us the booze!

14:41.673 --> 14:44.009
- What?
- You get home, son.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.385
You're lucky I'm letting
you off with a warning.

14:45.469 --> 14:46.762
But you, you're coming with me.

14:46.845 --> 14:48.972
- You got to be kidding!
- Do you need a ride?

14:49.097 --> 14:51.141
Nah, I'm just gonna stay
here until the sun comes up

14:51.225 --> 14:53.602
and then be the best at tetherball.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.438
Next!

15:03.904 --> 15:05.531
What are you in for?

15:05.614 --> 15:07.866
I bought some alcohol for
someone I thought was my friend.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.535
How about you?

15:09.618 --> 15:12.120
I threw a bottle of rum through
the window of the Apple Store.

15:12.204 --> 15:14.414
I couldn't remember me password.

15:14.498 --> 15:15.832
Well, this sucks.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.376
Oh, it's not so bad.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.211
Sometimes they let you
take the good trash home,

15:19.294 --> 15:20.546
if you ask nice.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.589
Last week, I got an old greeting card.

15:22.673 --> 15:23.841
It obviously wasn't for me,

15:23.924 --> 15:25.968
but the imagination's a hell of a thing.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.221
Hey, Brian, what time you get off?

15:29.304 --> 15:31.557
Me and the guys were hoping you
could buy us some more beer.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.809
- You can't be serious.
- Eh, it's a little bit serious.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.435
Yeah, I haven't been drunk in a day.

15:35.519 --> 15:37.479
And I'm not feeling particularly handsome.

15:37.563 --> 15:38.856
Peter, you're the reason I'm here!

15:38.939 --> 15:40.983
You totally sold me out to that cop!

15:41.066 --> 15:42.985
Oh, are we just gonna play the blame game?

15:43.068 --> 15:44.778
'Cause I got another game I'd rather play.

15:44.862 --> 15:46.071
Boggle.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.656
Go to hell! You used me.

15:47.739 --> 15:48.991
That's not what friends do.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.659
It's what Adam Sandler's friends do.

15:50.742 --> 15:53.370
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a half a can of hot beer

15:53.453 --> 15:55.831
left in this open container
I've been driving around with.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.463
You, too, pig.

16:03.547 --> 16:05.465
Well, I'm not the
smartest man in the world,

16:05.549 --> 16:09.052
but I can always look back on
my life and say I went for it.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.889
Ugh, this seems like a weird
place to even use a condom.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.057
Just shut up, Peter.
I'm done with you, all right?

16:14.141 --> 16:16.059
You completely lied about why
you were hanging out with me.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.311
What? I never lie.

16:17.394 --> 16:19.229
Well, except for that one time.

16:20.314 --> 16:22.733
Oh, my God!
My husband's having a heart attack!

16:22.816 --> 16:24.735
Is anyone here a doctor?

16:24.818 --> 16:26.862
I have a 13-inch penis!

16:29.114 --> 16:30.407
And besides, I'm sick of you

16:30.490 --> 16:31.658
acting like you're such a victim.

16:31.742 --> 16:32.868
You agreed to buy us booze,

16:32.951 --> 16:34.036
'cause we weren't old enough.

16:34.119 --> 16:35.287
You're not old enough?

16:35.370 --> 16:37.039
You're a man in his 40s!

16:37.122 --> 16:38.916
This whole law is ridiculous!

16:38.999 --> 16:40.542
Hey, can one of you guys with elbows

16:40.626 --> 16:42.920
try to get this truck to honk?

16:45.005 --> 16:46.673
Ah, that and giving noogies

16:46.757 --> 16:49.718
is what I miss most about having elbows.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.929
You know, Brian, what you said is right.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.472
This law is stupid.

16:53.555 --> 16:54.973
I mean, if it weren't for that,

16:55.057 --> 16:56.266
we never would've been in this fight.

16:56.350 --> 16:57.893
Yeah, but what difference does it make?

16:57.976 --> 17:00.020
It's the law. Nothing we can do about it.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.146
The hell there's not.

17:01.230 --> 17:02.648
I bet if we worked together

17:02.731 --> 17:04.107
we could find a way to change it back.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.068
I... I don't know, Peter.

17:06.151 --> 17:08.570
Come on, I know it seems hard,
but we can't just give up.

17:08.654 --> 17:10.572
I mean, what if Thomas Edison
had given up?

17:10.697 --> 17:13.075
Uh, what's that?
What's that thing you're working on?

17:13.158 --> 17:14.368
Well, it's a lightbulb and...

17:14.451 --> 17:16.912
A lightbulb! Lightbulb!
I invented that.

17:16.995 --> 17:18.539
Me... I'm Thomas Edison.

17:18.622 --> 17:19.915
I invented the lightbulb.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.124
Uh, what's it do?

17:21.208 --> 17:23.126
It lights up a room using electrical...

17:23.210 --> 17:25.170
Lights up a room using electrical stuff!

17:25.254 --> 17:28.882
I was about to say that,
because <i>I</i> invented it!

17:28.966 --> 17:30.133
Uh, what are you working on?

17:30.217 --> 17:32.135
- It's a phonograph...
- Phonograph!

17:32.219 --> 17:34.137
I knew that, 'cause <i>I</i> invented it.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.556
I'm Thomas Edison.

17:35.639 --> 17:36.932
I rule!

17:37.015 --> 17:38.267
<i>Look it up</i>

17:38.350 --> 17:40.727
<i>Edison was a dick</i>

17:43.856 --> 17:45.774
Okay, Peter, I know how
we can get the law changed.

17:45.858 --> 17:47.609
I've been doing some research,
and it says here

17:47.693 --> 17:50.362
that in eight months, we can
get a non-binding proposition

17:50.445 --> 17:53.156
on the ballot as long
as we get 4,000 signatures.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.033
Ah, screw that, we're going with plan B...

17:55.117 --> 17:56.910
threaten to kill the mayor's nephew.

17:56.994 --> 17:58.579
I love you, Dad!

17:58.662 --> 17:59.746
Peter, that's your son.

17:59.830 --> 18:00.956
Shut up, Brian!

18:01.039 --> 18:02.791
He's hugging me!

18:06.420 --> 18:08.046
So, what exactly is your plan, here?

18:08.130 --> 18:09.173
You'll see.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.340
Just follow my lead.

18:11.717 --> 18:13.719
Ooh, trick-or-treaters!

18:13.802 --> 18:15.304
Well, what do we have here?

18:15.387 --> 18:17.931
A cowboy and a princess?

18:18.015 --> 18:21.018
Uh, yippee-ki-yay, Mr. Mayor.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.979
Oh, a Western princess!

18:24.062 --> 18:26.106
All right, listen, we want
that drinking law gone.

18:26.190 --> 18:29.067
And everybody knows the best way
to get any law struck down

18:29.151 --> 18:30.986
is to get the gays angry about it.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.654
Bruce? Jeffrey?

18:32.738 --> 18:33.989
That's right, Mr. Mayor!

18:34.072 --> 18:35.782
I needs my Proseccos!

18:35.866 --> 18:37.993
What are you talking about?
You're 52.

18:38.076 --> 18:40.162
You said you was 39!

18:40.245 --> 18:41.955
I was just trying to get you in bed.

18:42.039 --> 18:44.583
I thought we'd both be dead by now.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.044
Crap. But come on,
you got to change that law!

18:47.127 --> 18:48.754
I mean, it's already ruined a friendship

18:48.837 --> 18:50.797
with one of the best guys I know!

18:50.881 --> 18:52.591
Adam, who's at the door?

18:52.674 --> 18:53.842
Oh, hi, Brian.

18:53.926 --> 18:55.010
Hi, Peter.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.553
Wait a minute.

18:56.637 --> 18:58.972
Is that, is that wine?

18:59.056 --> 19:02.059
Yeah, Adam just poured me
a little before dinner.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.185
Wow, you guys eat late.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.979
No, Peter, don't you see?
Carol's underage, too!

19:06.063 --> 19:08.148
The mayor just broke his own law!

19:09.149 --> 19:10.442
Mm, that's a good point.

19:10.526 --> 19:12.611
I guess I'll just have
to resign in scandal

19:12.694 --> 19:14.613
while leaving the law intact.

19:14.696 --> 19:17.658
Or you could just change the law.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.201
But it's a good law.

19:19.284 --> 19:20.452
No, it ain't!

19:20.536 --> 19:21.620
Look, don't you understand what drinking

19:21.703 --> 19:23.205
means to us working stiffs?

19:23.288 --> 19:25.207
It helps us forget about our day

19:25.290 --> 19:27.376
and tell our children we
love 'em with a straight face.

19:27.459 --> 19:31.255
It allows gross uggos to boof
each other's gross uggo parts.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.590
And it gives people the courage
to sneak onto their mayor's

19:33.674 --> 19:37.094
property and blackmail him
and eat all his ripe tomatoes.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.096
That was a croquet ball.

19:39.179 --> 19:42.391
Ah, then could you point me to
the closest nighttime dentist?

19:42.474 --> 19:45.269
So listen, Mr. Mayor,
what do you say about that law?

19:45.352 --> 19:47.646
All right, I'll repeal it.

19:47.729 --> 19:50.315
But only if you send me and
Carol a copy of that picture.

19:50.399 --> 19:53.193
We don't have a lot
of the two of us together.

19:53.277 --> 19:55.821
Brian, we did it!
We got him to change the law!

19:55.904 --> 19:58.198
Just goes to show, if anybody
wants a law changed,

19:58.282 --> 20:00.701
they should just go
to their mayor's house.

20:00.784 --> 20:03.120
Hey, I, uh, I-I appreciate

20:03.203 --> 20:04.913
what you said there, about our friendship.

20:04.997 --> 20:06.415
Well, to be honest, Brian,

20:06.498 --> 20:08.208
at first I did just want you
to buy us beer.

20:08.292 --> 20:10.836
But then the-the more we were hanging out,

20:10.919 --> 20:13.088
I-I remembered how much fun
we used to have together.

20:13.172 --> 20:14.923
I guess after all these years,

20:15.007 --> 20:17.092
I started taking you for granted.

20:17.176 --> 20:19.511
But you're still my best friend.

20:19.595 --> 20:21.680
Even if I don't always act like it.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.348
I enjoyed hanging out with you, too.

20:23.432 --> 20:25.100
Thanks, Peter.

20:25.184 --> 20:27.269
Hey, on your way out,

20:27.352 --> 20:30.063
could you put this in my
mailbox for the mailman?

20:30.147 --> 20:32.274
Uh, sure.
Put the flag up?

20:32.357 --> 20:33.942
Of course put the flag up!

20:34.026 --> 20:36.236
Geez, mail much?

20:41.658 --> 20:43.702
Well, Peter, I'm just happy
that you and Brian

20:43.785 --> 20:45.287
managed to get that law repealed,

20:45.370 --> 20:46.914
and that you're finally friends again.

20:46.997 --> 20:48.165
Me, too, Lois.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.167
Good to have my drinking buddy back.

20:50.250 --> 20:53.086
Yay, everybody's happy!

20:53.170 --> 20:55.797
I love this family!

20:56.215 --> 20:57.508
I draped that over him.

20:57.591 --> 20:58.884
He was just doing it out in the open.
