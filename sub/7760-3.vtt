01:48.842 --> 01:51.345
I LOST A SOCK
AND A PAIR OF SHORTS,

01:51.379 --> 01:52.646
BUT THE FUCK IF I'M GOING
BACK DOWN THERE

01:52.680 --> 01:56.884

THIS GUY DOWN THERE.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.890
THIS--

02:02.923 --> 02:05.559
THIS INCREDIBLY HOT GUY,

02:05.593 --> 02:07.395
AND I WAS BENDING OVER

02:07.428 --> 02:09.230
TO GET MY LAUNDRY
OUT OF THE DRYER,

02:09.263 --> 02:10.898
AND HE RIPPED OFF MY PANTS,

02:10.931 --> 02:12.366
AND HE FUCKED THE SHIT
OUT OF ME.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.501
[grunts]

02:13.534 --> 02:15.469

- HEY.

02:20.874 --> 02:22.643
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:22.676 --> 02:24.278
- I'M READING THE NEWSPAPER,
AND I'M NEARSIGHTED.

02:24.312 --> 02:25.913
SO I--
OH, THE CLASSIFIEDS. OH.

02:25.946 --> 02:28.416
- YEAH, I'M LOOKING
FOR AN APARTMENT, MICHAEL.

02:28.449 --> 02:31.319
- [groans] YOU ALREADY HAVE
AN APARTMENT,

02:31.352 --> 02:33.521
COMPLETE WITH APPLIANCES
AND HARDWOOD FLOORS

02:33.554 --> 02:35.389
AND A BUILT-IN BOYFRIEND.
- YEAH, I TOLD YOU.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.857
I THINK IT'S BEST
IF I HAVE MY OWN PLACE.

02:36.890 --> 02:40.428
- YEAH, AND I THINK
IT'S BEST THAT YOU STAY.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.940

RATHER BE OUT WITH BRIAN?

- [moaning]

02:58.646 --> 03:02.416
- WELL, I HAVE TO ADMIT,
IT IS TEMPTING.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.984
BUT THEN, I WOULD MISS OUT

03:04.017 --> 03:07.721
ON ALL THE PRE-SOAKING
AND SPIN-DRYING,

03:07.755 --> 03:08.989
AND NOT TO MENTION,

03:09.022 --> 03:12.226
HAVING THE HOTTEST MAN
IN PITTSBURGH

03:12.260 --> 03:15.663
TO HELP ME FLUFF AND FOLD.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.738
- HELP YOU
WITH THE CENTER CARNIVAL?

03:24.772 --> 03:26.340
ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?

03:26.374 --> 03:27.841
- I LIKE TO THINK NOT.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.477
- AFTER THE WAY
THEY SCREWED ME,

03:29.510 --> 03:30.478
THE ONLY THING I'D LIKE
TO HELP THE CENTER DO

03:30.511 --> 03:31.912
IS SELF-DESTRUCT.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.581
- WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN

03:33.614 --> 03:34.848
IF WE DON'T BOOST
OUR CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP

03:34.882 --> 03:36.350
AND RAISE
A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.486
- IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.726
- [clears throat]

[Gus babbles]

03:48.829 --> 03:51.465
ANYONE ELSE IN THERE
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

03:51.499 --> 03:53.934
- HOPEFULLY NOT BEFORE I DO.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.603
- LOOK, IT MAY NOT
BE YOUR PROBLEM.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.770
BUT IT'D BE
A VERY BIG PROBLEM

03:56.804 --> 03:58.339
FOR A LOT OF MEMBERS
OF OUR COMMUNITY

03:58.372 --> 03:59.740
IF WE HAD TO CUT
ON AIDS HOSPICE CARE

03:59.773 --> 04:00.808
OR THE HOMELESS TEEN SHELTER.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.476
ALL I'M ASKING

04:02.510 --> 04:04.378
IS FOR YOU TO VOLUNTEER
A FEW HOURS OF YOUR TIME

04:04.412 --> 04:06.380
TO HELP ORGANIZE
THIS FUND-RAISER.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.815
MAYBE CALL
A FEW OF YOUR CLIENTS

04:07.848 --> 04:09.383
AND SEE IF THEY'D BE
WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.519
- OH, I-I DON'T DO
VOLUNTEER WORK.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.921
- OH, THANKS A LOT, BRIAN.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.489
HOPE I DIDN'T KEEP YOU
FROM ATTENDING

04:15.523 --> 04:18.626
TO MORE IMPORTANT THINGS.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.429
- HOWEVER, THE CENTER AND I
MAY BE ABLE

04:21.462 --> 04:23.564
TO COME TO SOME MORE...

04:23.597 --> 04:26.900
AMENABLE AGREEMENT?

04:26.934 --> 04:28.769
- THERE IS NO WAY
WE'RE WORKING WITH HIM.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.371
- IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.573
- I UNDERSTAND YOUR RELUCTANCE
TO GET INVOLVED.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.042
HOWEVER, IF HE'S WILLING
TO PUT PAST HOSTILITIES ASIDE,

04:35.075 --> 04:36.710
I SAY
WE SHOULD DO THE SAME.

04:36.744 --> 04:41.048
- JUST WHAT EXACTLY
IS MR. KINNEY OFFERING TO DO?

04:41.081 --> 04:44.385
- ORGANIZE THE EVENT, BRING IN
CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP...

04:44.418 --> 04:46.387
- I SAY WE'RE DOING FINE
WITHOUT HIM.

04:46.420 --> 04:50.524
- IF YOU CALL SELLING
40 TICKETS "DOING FINE."

04:50.558 --> 04:51.959
BRIAN'S PUT TOGETHER
A PROPOSAL

04:51.992 --> 04:53.527
TO GIVE THE CARNIVAL
A BIT MORE EDGE.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.429
OOPS.
- EDGE?

04:55.463 --> 04:57.931
- HE'S ALSO CONTACTED
A FEW OF HIS CLIENTS.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.401
AND THEY'VE AGREED
TO SPONSOR THE EVENT

05:00.434 --> 05:03.571
AND MATCH ANY FUNDS WE RAISE
UP TO $100,000.

05:06.707 --> 05:09.477
- PLEASE EXTEND
TO MR. KINNEY

05:09.510 --> 05:11.545
THE CENTER'S GRATITUDE

05:11.579 --> 05:13.447
FOR VOLUNTEERING HIS TIME
AND EFFORT.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.815
- [giggles excitedly]

05:14.848 --> 05:18.419
- WELL, HE'S...
NOT EXACTLY VOLUNTEERING.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.688
- HE WANTS 20%
OFF THE TOP.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.123
- HE EXPECTS US TO PAY HIM?
FOR FUND-RAISING?

05:23.156 --> 05:25.459
- IS HE KIDDING?
- WELL, HIS FEELING IS,

05:25.493 --> 05:28.128
"WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE
100% OF NOTHING

05:28.161 --> 05:33.601
OR 80% OF MORE THAN YOU EVER
FUCKING DREAMED OF?"

05:33.634 --> 05:39.006
- * GOTTA GET OUT
ON MY OWN *

05:39.039 --> 05:40.708
* I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF THE CROWD *

05:40.741 --> 05:43.611
* GOTTA GET OUT
ON MY OWN *

05:43.644 --> 05:45.579
* PUSHED
AND KNOCKED AROUND *

05:45.613 --> 05:47.648
* I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THE CROWD
- HMM.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.149
- * GOTTA GET OUT ON MY OWN

05:49.182 --> 05:51.519
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
SHOULD I BUY IT?

05:51.552 --> 05:53.153
- $30,000?

05:53.186 --> 05:54.988
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY
FOR AN OLD CAR.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.590
- IT'S NOT OLD.
IT'S A CLASSIC.

05:56.624 --> 05:58.158
- SO HOW DO YOU PLAN
ON PAYING FOR IT?

05:58.191 --> 05:59.893
- A LITTLE EXTRA CASH
JUST FELL IN MY LAP.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.729
- WELL, THAT'S
A SIZEABLE CHUNK OF CHANGE

06:01.762 --> 06:04.164
FOR BOYFRIEND REPLACEMENT
THERAPY.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.066
- I DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

06:06.099 --> 06:09.169
I'VE NEVER HAD A BOYFRIEND.
- RIGHT.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.738
THEN IT MUST BE
A MID-LIFE CRISIS.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.473
- I'M ONLY 30--
- 1.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.642
- AND SINCE I PLAN ON BEING DEAD
BY THE TIME I'M 39,

06:14.675 --> 06:16.076
THAT'S ONE ANNOYANCE
I WON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.678
- YEAH. I'LL BE SURE
TO REMIND YOU OF THAT

06:17.711 --> 06:20.681
ON YOUR 60TH BIRTHDAY.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.416
- COME ON, MIKEY.
IF WE LEAVE NOW,

06:22.450 --> 06:23.517
WE CAN BE IN NEW YORK
BY MIDNIGHT.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.053
- NO FUCKING WAY.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.888
BEN NEARLY MOVED OUT
BECAUSE OF YOU.

06:27.921 --> 06:31.058
- * OVER THE EDGE
OF THE WORLD *

06:31.091 --> 06:34.762
* DON'T STOP TO WONDER

06:34.795 --> 06:36.630
* WONDER WHAT IT MEANS

06:36.664 --> 06:38.666
[tires squeal]

06:40.200 --> 06:42.903
- JEAN, YOUR ORDER'S UP.
- OKAY.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.838
- IS THAT LOOK OF LONGING

06:44.872 --> 06:47.074
FOR ME
OR THE COCONUT CREAM?

06:47.107 --> 06:49.777
- [laughs]
NOW WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW?

06:49.810 --> 06:51.512
- [chuckles]
WANT THE LAST BITE?

06:51.545 --> 06:53.080
- HELL, NO.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.649
I'M ALMOST AT THE POINT
WHERE I ACTUALLY HAVE A WAIST.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.551
OR HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED?

06:57.585 --> 06:59.553
- OH, I'VE NOTICED.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.188
- AND?

07:01.221 --> 07:03.924
- AND IT'S LOOKIN' GOOD.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.460
REAL GOOD.
- COME ON, DEB.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.528
[bell ringing]

07:07.561 --> 07:09.129
- UM...

07:09.162 --> 07:10.230
ORDER'S UP.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.065
- SEE YOU FRIDAY?
- YEAH.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.535
I'LL RESERVE A LANE.
- WHAT DO YOU SAY

07:14.568 --> 07:16.570
WE SKIP THE BOWLING
THIS WEEK,

07:16.604 --> 07:17.938
MAYBE HAVE
A LITTLE DINNER?

07:17.971 --> 07:20.140
- FRIDAY IS
3 GRAMS OF FISH

07:20.173 --> 07:22.743
AND 4 OUNCES
OF STEAMED KALE.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.944
- MMM!
MY FAVORITE.

07:23.977 --> 07:24.945
- [laughs]

07:24.978 --> 07:27.815
- AFTERWARDS WE CAN WATCH TV.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.116
- YEAH, WELL,
THE--THE--

07:29.149 --> 07:31.485
THE SET DOWNSTAIRS
IS STILL ON THE FRITZ.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.220
THE ONLY ONE
THAT'S WORKING

07:33.253 --> 07:34.888
IS THE ONE
IN MY BEDROOM.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.591
- I KNOW.

07:37.625 --> 07:41.094
[laughs]
- [chuckles]

07:41.128 --> 07:42.095
- BE RIGHT BACK.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.897
- [laughs]

07:43.931 --> 07:47.601
- THERE YOU GO.
- OOH, FOOD.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.570
- SO, DEB...

07:49.603 --> 07:51.104
WHAT'S IT LIKE,
DOING IT WITH A COP?

07:51.138 --> 07:52.740
- [chuckles]
DOES HE

07:52.773 --> 07:53.874
CONDUCT A STRIP SEARCH?

07:53.907 --> 07:54.975
- HANDCUFF YOU TO THE BED?

07:55.008 --> 07:56.844
- WORK YOU OVER
TILL YOU SING?

07:56.877 --> 07:59.980
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT M.Y.O.B. STANDS FOR?

08:00.013 --> 08:04.785
MIND YOUR OWN
FUCKING BUSINESS.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.720
- SHOULDN'T THERE BE
AN "F" IN THERE?

08:06.754 --> 08:08.055
- HMM.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.256
- HI, BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.591
[fingers snap]

08:10.624 --> 08:15.696
[indistinct conversation]

08:19.032 --> 08:22.002
- I HAVE A PROPOSITION.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.871
A BUSINESS PROPOSITION.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.139
- WHAT'D YOU HAVE IN MIND?
- A POSTER.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.742
SOMETHING HOT AND BRILLIANT

08:28.776 --> 08:30.744
AND SOMETHING BY TOMORROW?

08:30.778 --> 08:33.681
- [sighs]

08:33.714 --> 08:36.083
- I WOULDN'T ASK YOU IF
I DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD DO IT.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.885
- OR IF YOU WEREN'T DESPERATE.

08:37.918 --> 08:41.321
- YEAH, THAT TOO.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.790
- WHAT'S IT FOR?

08:42.823 --> 08:45.058
- IT'S FOR
THE CENTER CARNIVAL.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.060
- YOU FUCKING HATE
THE CENTER.

08:47.094 --> 08:50.030
- NOT WHEN THEY'RE PAYING ME.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.299
SO HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT?

08:52.332 --> 08:54.635
- IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE,
SO IT'S FREE.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.670
- CHRIST,
DIDN'T I TEACH YOU ANYTHING?

08:56.704 --> 08:57.671
- 500.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.306
- 200.
- 500.

08:59.339 --> 09:02.175
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.945
- I LIKE THE WAY
YOU DO BUSINESS.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.684
- YOU HAD THE PROCEDURE?

09:10.718 --> 09:12.786
- LIKE YOU SAID,
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.121
HE DID IT IN THE OFFICE,

09:14.154 --> 09:15.956
ZAPPED ME WITH A LASER,
A COUPLE OF STITCHES--

09:15.989 --> 09:17.958
- BUT YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME.
I WOULD'VE COME.

09:17.991 --> 09:20.327
- IT WAS SOMETHING I HAD
TO DO ON MY OWN,

09:20.360 --> 09:21.962
LIKE BUNGEE JUMPING.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.931
- I HOPE THAT'S NOT NEXT.
[nervous chuckle]

09:23.964 --> 09:25.799
- I MEAN, FACE MY FEARS
HEAD-ON

09:25.833 --> 09:27.935
AND HOPE
I DON'T LAND SPLAT.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.070
- AND DID YOU LAND SPLAT?

09:30.103 --> 09:32.339
- EVERYTHING'S FINE.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.341
HE SAID I CAN GET PREGNANT
RIGHT AWAY.

09:34.374 --> 09:37.144
- OH.
MEL.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.212
- [sighs]
- MM.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.115
- OH.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.217
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
I WAS--

09:44.251 --> 09:46.086
I WAS JUST USING IT
AS AN EXCUSE.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.955
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
- IT MATTERS A LOT.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.357
BECAUSE I WANT
TO BE THE ONE

09:50.390 --> 09:52.225
TO CARRY OUR NEXT CHILD.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.629
- ARE YOU SURE?

09:55.663 --> 09:57.831
SO WE COULD HAVE
A LITTLE MELANIE?

09:57.865 --> 09:59.833
- OR MELVIN.
- BY NEXT CHRISTMAS?

09:59.867 --> 10:01.368
- HANUKKAH.
- AH!

10:01.401 --> 10:03.003
- [sighs]

10:03.036 --> 10:05.372
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS PICK A DONOR.

10:05.405 --> 10:10.143
- I THOUGHT
WE ALREADY HAD ONE.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.012
- THERE'S NO FUCKING WAY

10:12.045 --> 10:14.014
BRIAN KINNEY'S FUCKING SPERM
ARE DOING THE BREASTSTROKE

10:14.047 --> 10:15.248
UP MY FALLOPIAN TUBE.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.718
- THEY DO
THE AUSTRALIAN CRAWL.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.286
I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.754
- WELL,

10:20.788 --> 10:23.423
NOT AFTER ALL THE GRIEF
HE'S CAUSED US.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.759
WE ARE NOT MAKING
THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.427
- I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY
HOW YOU FEEL,

10:27.460 --> 10:29.296
BUT WHAT IF SOMETHING
WERE TO HAPPEN TO US?

10:29.329 --> 10:31.264
A FATAL ACCIDENT?
- BUNGEE JUMPING?

10:31.298 --> 10:33.867
- I'M SERIOUS. AT LEAST OUR KIDS
WOULD HAVE THE SAME FATHER.

10:33.901 --> 10:34.868
- OH, SOME FATHER.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.937
SELFISH, PROMISCUOUS.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.405
WHO KNOWS
IF HE'S EVEN NEGATIVE?

10:38.438 --> 10:40.340
- WELL, WHOEVER IT IS
WOULD HAVE TO BE TESTED.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.776
BUT THINK HOW GOOD
HE'S BEEN TO US AND TO GUS.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.344
ALWAYS THERE TO WRITE
A CHECK,

10:44.377 --> 10:47.014
PUT UP A SWING SET, AND SAVE
OUR WEDDING FROM DISASTER.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.950
HONESTLY, MEL,
HE'S NOT THE OLD BRIAN.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.018
HE'S CHANGED.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.452
AND BOTTOM LINE...

10:52.485 --> 10:57.024
WITHOUT HIM, OUR KIDS
WOULDN'T BE RELATED.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.760

11:12.105 --> 11:14.041
- AND HE SOUNDS LIKE JANE.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.043
- I'D WARBLE LIKE
A COLORATURA

11:16.076 --> 11:17.811
IF I HAD PECS LIKE HIS.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.847
- WELL, SHOOT YOURSELF UP
WITH JUNGLE JUICE, AND YOU CAN.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.915
- WHAT, STEROIDS?

11:21.949 --> 11:23.350
- YEAH, I'M SURPRISED HIS LIVER
HASN'T FALLEN OUT

11:23.383 --> 11:24.451
OF HIS ASSHOLE.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.986
- NOT TO MENTION MOOD SWINGS

11:26.019 --> 11:27.187
AND HIS BALLS SHRINKING UP

11:27.220 --> 11:28.455
TO THE SIZE

11:32.225 --> 11:33.727

- JESUS, MA, YOU ALREADY
GO TO THE SAME BARS

11:35.996 --> 11:37.130
AND THE SAME CLUBS I DO.

11:37.164 --> 11:38.999
NOW YOU GOTTA COME
TO THE SAME GYM?

11:39.032 --> 11:41.334
CAN'T I HAVE ONE PLACE
IN THE WORLD THAT'S MY OWN?

I HAVE NO INTENTION

12:00.954 --> 12:01.989
OF TURNING

12:02.022 --> 12:03.957
OF MY PERSONAL LIFE
INTO GYM GOSSIP,

12:03.991 --> 12:05.358
LIKE YOU GAY GUYS.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.095
- IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU HAVEN'T DONE IT YET.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.831
- WELL, IT ISN'T
BECAUSE HE ISN'T INTERESTED.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.499
IT'S JUST BEEN
A WHILE SINCE I--

12:12.532 --> 12:14.401
I WORKED OUT.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.971
I WOULDN'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT HIM.

12:18.005 --> 12:19.907
- WELL,

12:19.940 --> 12:22.242
IF ANYONE KNOWS
HOW TO PLEASE HIS MAN,

12:22.275 --> 12:24.878
IT'S EM.

12:24.912 --> 12:27.247
- HUSH.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.117
HONEY, ALL YOU NEED IS
A LITTLE REFRESHER COURSE.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.518
AND WHO BETTER
TO INSTRUCT YOU

12:31.551 --> 12:35.122
THAN PROFESSORS HONEYCUTT

12:35.155 --> 12:37.991
- DOCTORS OF DICKOLOGY.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.293
- [chuckles]

12:53.907 --> 12:56.877
- SHE'S NOT IN HERE,
IS SHE?

12:56.910 --> 12:58.545
- WHO?
- MY MOTHER.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.013
- IT'S THE MEN'S LOCKER ROOM.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.548

THAT'LL STOP HER?

13:01.581 --> 13:02.549
- [laughs]

13:02.582 --> 13:04.017
- A FULL HOUR ON THE PRECOR,

13:04.051 --> 13:05.185
AND ALL I DROPPED
WAS A POUND.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.154
- GOTTA CUT BACK
ON THAT PIZZA.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.422
HEY, BEN.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.024
HOW'S IT GOING?
- GOOD.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.592
- REMEMBER THOSE FIVE MINUTES
IN THE '90s

13:12.625 --> 13:14.027
WHEN EVERYBODY WANTED
TO PUT ON WEIGHT

13:14.061 --> 13:15.295
BECAUSE IT MEANT
YOU WEREN'T DYING?

13:15.328 --> 13:16.964
- DIDN'T DO PAUL ANY GOOD.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.065
- AT LEAST WE DON'T HAVE
TO GO BACK

13:18.098 --> 13:19.299
TO THAT GODDAMN HOSPICE.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.968
TALK ABOUT DEPRESSING.

13:21.001 --> 13:24.337
- SORRY,
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT PAUL?

13:24.371 --> 13:26.439
- OH, DIDN'T YOU HEAR?

13:26.473 --> 13:29.376
HE DIED LAST NIGHT.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.215
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL BE THERE.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.050
EVEN IF IT MEANS
INCURRING ISHIGURA'S WRATH

13:37.084 --> 13:39.252
FOR NOT PRACTICING MY BARTOK.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.055
I DON'T KNOW, I'LL ASK HIM.

13:42.089 --> 13:44.057
HEY, JUS, MY FRIEND COLLIER
WANTS TO KNOW

13:44.091 --> 13:46.960
IF MY IMAGINARY LOVER WILL BE
ACCOMPANYING ME TO HIS SOIREE.

13:46.994 --> 13:50.530
- TELL HIM I WOULD SOONER
EAT SHIT AND DIE.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.199
- HE SAYS HE CAN'T WAIT
TO MEET YOU.

13:52.232 --> 13:55.068
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.470
NOW, WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO BE SO ANTISOCIAL?

13:57.504 --> 13:59.206
- I'M NOT ANTISOCIAL.

13:59.239 --> 14:03.110
I JUST CAN'T STAND PEOPLE.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.026
- IT'S A POSTER I'M WORKING ON
FOR A CHARITY EVENT.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.094
- I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD THROW
A BENEFIT FOR US.

14:21.128 --> 14:24.097

HOW DID YOU SWING THAT?

14:31.204 --> 14:32.639
- SOMEONE I KNOW.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.374

14:34.407 --> 14:36.376
SOMEONE YOU KNOW.
SOMEONE WE BOTH KNOW?

14:36.409 --> 14:38.011
- HE NEEDED AN ARTIST.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.247
- AND EVEN THOUGH HE WORKS
WITH DOZENS OF THEM

14:40.280 --> 14:41.548
ALL DAY LONG
IN HIS OFFICE,

14:41.581 --> 14:43.383
HE MIRACULOUSLY THOUGHT
OF YOU.

14:43.416 --> 14:47.654
- MAYBE HE THOUGHT I WAS
BEST QUALIFIED FOR THE JOB.

14:47.687 --> 14:50.123
- OR MAYBE HE'S JUST TRYING
TO WIN YOU BACK.

14:50.157 --> 14:53.193
- HE CAN TRY
ALL HE WANTS.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.128
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I WOULD EVER GO?

14:55.162 --> 14:56.997
- OH, I DON'T KNOW,
HE'S RICH, GORGEOUS,

14:57.030 --> 14:58.999
HE CAN MAKE CASH
MAGICALLY APPEAR.

14:59.032 --> 15:02.402

15:10.443 --> 15:11.544
- [laughs]

15:11.578 --> 15:13.413
I'M NOT GOING TO PROVE IT.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.891
CREATING A VELVET VISE.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.260
- MMM.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.628
NOW OPEN WIDE...

18:48.661 --> 18:50.763
[muffled]
BEING SURE TO COVER THE TEETH,

18:50.797 --> 18:53.800
ALLOWING FOR A SMOOTH
AND UNOBSTRUCTED ENTRY.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.703
COMME CA.
[inhales]

18:59.439 --> 19:02.242
- BOYS,
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.244
I JUST NEED
TO ASK ONE QUESTION.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.712
- IF IT'S ABOUT SUPPRESSING
THE GAG REFLEX,

19:05.745 --> 19:07.180
WE'RE GETTING TO THAT.

19:07.214 --> 19:10.650
- ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MINDS?

19:10.683 --> 19:12.952
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M GONNA DO THIS.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.188
- THERE ARE PARTIES
IN BEVERLY HILLS

19:15.222 --> 19:17.390
WHERE HOUSEWIVES PAY
1,000 BUCKS A HEAD.

19:17.424 --> 19:18.791
- SO TO SPEAK.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.927
- TO LEARN WHAT
WE'RE TEACHING YOU FOR FREE.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.562
- DEBBIE,

19:22.595 --> 19:25.532
YOU WANT TO MAKE HORVATH HAPPY,
DON'T YOU?

19:25.565 --> 19:27.267
- SURE, I DO.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.469
- AND EVEN HAVE
A GOOD TIME YOURSELF?

19:29.502 --> 19:31.338
- SO WHAT'S THE HARM
IN LEARNING

19:31.371 --> 19:35.174
HOW TO DO IT
THE RIGHT WAY?

19:40.847 --> 19:44.217
[inhales deeply]

19:51.391 --> 19:54.461

19:54.494 --> 19:55.828

19:55.862 --> 19:56.963
[all inhaling]

19:56.996 --> 20:01.901
[indistinct chatter]

20:23.790 --> 20:25.024
- IT'S CHILLY OUT HERE.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.227
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO GET S--

20:29.362 --> 20:31.998
- THANK YOU.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.267
I AM ALL RIGHT.

20:35.768 --> 20:39.005
- I'M SORRY.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.408
- FOR WHAT?

20:41.441 --> 20:43.410
- FOR PAUL.
FOR YOU.

20:43.443 --> 20:47.647
- I JUST DIDN'T EXPECT IT
TO BE SO SOON.

20:47.680 --> 20:51.751
IF I'D KNOWN, I WOULD'VE GONE
TO SEE HIM MORE OFTEN.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.620
- YOU WERE BUSY.

20:53.653 --> 20:56.823
- YEAH, RIGHT.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.491
THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD EXCUSE,
NOT TO VISIT SOMEONE

20:58.525 --> 21:00.927
YOU ONCE SHARED YOUR LIFE WITH,
YOUR BED.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.897
- I'M SURE HE UNDERSTOOD.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.567
AND FORGAVE YOU THE SAME WAY
YOU FORGAVE HIM.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.638
- THEN WHY AM I SO GODDAMN ANGRY
AT HIM RIGHT NOW?

21:11.671 --> 21:15.542
FOR GETTING IT,
FOR GIVING IT TO ME.

21:15.575 --> 21:16.976
AND THEN NOT EVEN BOTHERING

21:17.009 --> 21:18.978
TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF
OR WATCH WHAT HE ATE.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.381
I WOULD TELL HIM,
"NUTRITION IS ESSENTIAL.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.515
"AND EXERCISE.

21:22.549 --> 21:23.516
"YOU'VE GOT TO EXERCISE, PAUL,

21:23.550 --> 21:24.817
BUILD UP YOUR MUSCLE MASS."

21:24.851 --> 21:28.555
BUT IT WAS AS IF
ONCE HE KNEW HE HAD IT...

21:30.089 --> 21:32.459
HE FIGURED,
"I'M GOING TO DIE ANYWAY,

21:32.492 --> 21:36.028
SO WHAT THE HELL DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?"

21:37.697 --> 21:41.100
- LUCKILY,
YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.802
- RIGHT.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.004
- YOU DO EVERYTHING
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.407
EVERYTHING YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO.
- AND IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING,

21:47.440 --> 21:48.475
I STILL ENDED UP
IN THE HOSPITAL.

21:48.508 --> 21:51.344
MAYBE HE'S RIGHT.

21:51.378 --> 21:52.412
MAYBE IT DOESN'T MATTER.

21:52.445 --> 21:53.946
- IT DOES MATTER.

21:53.980 --> 21:57.884
AND MOST IMPORTANT IS
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IT DOES.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.637
- MORE COD?

22:17.670 --> 22:18.771
- OH.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.973
3 GRAMS,
I'M STUFFED.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.509
[laughter]

22:22.542 --> 22:23.910
- WELL, THERE'S FRUIT
FOR DESSERT.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.045
I KNOW IT'S NOT EXACTLY
EXCITING, BUT--

22:26.078 --> 22:28.615
- WITH YOU IN THE ROOM,
WHAT COULD BE?

22:31.083 --> 22:33.920
- I'LL GET THE FRUIT.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.923
- FORGET THE FRUIT.

22:36.956 --> 22:37.990
- OH.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.158
- I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.159
- I'M TOO HEAVY,
YOU--

22:40.192 --> 22:43.362
- YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

22:44.664 --> 22:47.033
- CARL...

22:47.066 --> 22:49.135
I HAVE A CONFESSION
TO MAKE.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.670
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.405
- ABOUT WHAT?

22:52.439 --> 22:54.507
- ABOUT THIS.

22:56.576 --> 23:00.747
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.949
IT'S JUST
THAT IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.

23:02.982 --> 23:06.686
- HOW LONG?

23:06.719 --> 23:08.888
- LAST CENTURY.

23:08.921 --> 23:12.425
- WELL, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.794
I PROMISE TO BE GENTLE,
GUIDE YOU THROUGH IT.

23:14.827 --> 23:18.064
MAYBE EVEN TEACH YOU
A FEW THINGS.

23:25.071 --> 23:29.642
- THE EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE
NEEDS TO BE MORE ENTICING,

23:29.676 --> 23:32.979
BUT MORE FOREBODING.

23:33.012 --> 23:36.716
"ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK.
PREPARE TO BE FUCKED."

23:36.749 --> 23:39.852
- THINK I CAN MANAGE THAT.

23:39.886 --> 23:41.521
- YOU COULD PROBABLY GET
A BETTER VIEW

23:41.554 --> 23:44.491
IF YOU STOOD
A LITTLE CLOSER.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.962
AND HIS HIPS NEED
TO BE MORE IN PROFILE

23:49.996 --> 23:52.865
TO ACCENTUATE HIS COCK.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.601
- IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT SEX.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.836
- UNLESS IT'S ABOUT DEATH,
BUT...

23:56.869 --> 23:58.805
DEATH DOESN'T SELL TICKETS.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.540
[door sliding]

24:00.573 --> 24:02.509
- I PICKED UP
CHINESE FOOD.

24:05.712 --> 24:07.947
I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS FOR THREE.

24:07.980 --> 24:11.217
- I WAS JUST GOING.

24:11.250 --> 24:14.186
WE'RE DONE, RIGHT?

24:17.524 --> 24:19.158
- HEY.
- HEY.

24:19.191 --> 24:22.161

AND MADE UP.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.131
HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU?

24:25.164 --> 24:26.566
- IT'S ON ME.

24:26.599 --> 24:31.003
- HMM.
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

24:31.037 --> 24:35.608
ALLOW ME TO SUPPLY...

25:15.314 --> 25:18.284
- TONY FACELLI.
REMEMBER?

25:18.317 --> 25:21.153
HE WAS THE ONE WHO TAUGHT US
HOW TO LIGHT OUR FARTS?

25:21.187 --> 25:22.689

CAUGHT ON FIRE.

SHE GOT EXPELLED FOR GIVING
MR. DORF,

25:39.872 --> 25:41.574

26:11.237 --> 26:13.606
TO WANT TO BRING
A CHILD INTO IT.

27:17.036 --> 27:20.673
ALL THAT LIP SERVICE
ABOUT HOW NERVOUS YOU WERE.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.010
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

- AH.

27:26.245 --> 27:28.014
NOTHING.

27:34.186 --> 27:36.823
NO ONE COULD DO WHAT YOU JUST
DID WITHOUT A LITTLE PRACTICE.

27:36.856 --> 27:41.327

UH, YOU KNOW...

27:41.360 --> 27:45.064

YOU COULD TEACH A CLASS.

27:45.097 --> 27:46.833

BUT WE'VE ALREADY GOT PLANS.

29:02.108 --> 29:04.276

WHY AREN'T YOU IN CLASS?

29:11.150 --> 29:14.053

ON TABLE FOUR.

I DEFY ANY MALE,
LIVING OR DEAD,

29:46.052 --> 29:47.553

TO OUR TIME-TESTED TECHNIQUE.

29:47.586 --> 29:50.056

OUR INSTRUCTIONS.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.423
- OH, I FOLLOWED 'EM.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.893
HE RESPONDED
TO EVERY FLICK AND LICK.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.294
- AND SO
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

29:55.327 --> 29:57.296
- THE PROBLEM IS HE THINKS
I'M A WHORE.

29:57.329 --> 30:00.032
- I'M SO PROUD.

30:00.066 --> 30:03.502

32:52.504 --> 32:54.606
IS IN A LITTLE BIT
OF TROUBLE.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.376
- SEEMS LAST NIGHT,

32:57.409 --> 33:02.514
AN ORAL...MISDEMEANOR
OCCURRED.

33:04.250 --> 33:07.186
- DON'T YOU HAVE
SOME WORK TO DO?

33:09.121 --> 33:10.389
WHAT THE HELL'S
ALL THIS ABOUT?

33:10.422 --> 33:13.225
- LOOK, DEBBIE TOLD US
THAT YOU HAD SEX,

33:13.259 --> 33:16.395
OR SOME HETEROSEXUAL
PERMUTATION THEREOF.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.663
- JESUS H. CHRIST.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.265
WHY DOESN'T SHE RENT
A BILLBOARD?

33:19.298 --> 33:21.633
WHAT WE DO IN BED
IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

33:21.667 --> 33:22.634
- ACTUALLY, IT IS.

33:22.668 --> 33:25.371
SEE, UM, DEBBIE WAS WORRIED

33:25.404 --> 33:27.506
THAT SHE WOULDN'T LIVE UP
TO YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.241
- THAT SHE'D LET YOU DOWN.

33:29.275 --> 33:31.577
SO WE GAVE HER
A CRASH COURSE.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.812
- "INTRODUCTION

33:33.845 --> 33:36.115

WITH HONORS.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.254
- MAGNA CUM LOUDLY.

33:42.288 --> 33:44.290

YOU, APPARENTLY...

33:45.424 --> 33:46.392
- AND MISGUIDEDLY--

33:46.425 --> 33:47.693
- THINK SHE'S A SLUT.

33:47.726 --> 33:50.062
THE TRUTH IS, DETECTIVE,

33:50.096 --> 33:51.797
WE'RE THE SLUTS.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.800
- SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.402
[clears throat]
LOOK.

33:56.435 --> 33:59.405
UNDERNEATH ALL THAT DIRTY TALK
AND BRAVADO,

33:59.438 --> 34:02.274
YOU KNOW, DEBBIE IS JUST
AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL

34:02.308 --> 34:04.343
WHOSE ONLY CRIME WAS

34:04.376 --> 34:07.346
WANTING TO PLEASE HER MAN.

34:11.650 --> 34:14.620
AH.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.592
OH, HONEY.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.428

A CERTAIN FINALIST

34:22.461 --> 34:24.330
IS OUT OF THE COMPETITION.

34:24.363 --> 34:26.165
- OH, POOR MARTA.

34:26.198 --> 34:28.500
SHE'S AN ASTONISHING TALENT,
BUT TERRIFIED TO PERFORM.

34:28.534 --> 34:30.169
- AND THIS WILL BE THE TREE
IN THE FOREST

34:30.202 --> 34:31.303
THAT NOBODY HEARS.

34:31.337 --> 34:32.571
- AND THEN THERE'S GIORGIO.

34:32.604 --> 34:33.705
MEDIOCRE MUSICIAN AT BEST.

34:37.776 --> 34:39.311
THEY WON'T BE
SO EASILY FOOLED.

34:39.345 --> 34:41.647

41:12.904 --> 41:14.272
- HOO-HOO.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.141
- IT'S A NIGHT
OF FUN AND SURPRISES.

41:16.174 --> 41:18.009
- I'LL SAY.
- COME ON, YOU.

41:18.043 --> 41:19.511

- WHAT SHOULD WE DO NEXT?
WHAT SHOULD WE DO NEXT?

BRIAN'S STILL
THE SAME IRRESPONSIBLE FUCKER

41:34.025 --> 41:35.794
HE ALWAYS WAS.
- SHH.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.796
ON THE OTHER HAND, HE DID MAKE
THE CENTER ALMOST 100,000,

41:37.829 --> 41:39.130
MINUS HIS PERCENTAGE.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.600
- YEAH, AND HUMILIATE THEM
IN THE PROCESS.

41:41.633 --> 41:44.169
- THAT DIDN'T STOP THEM
FROM ACCEPTING THE MONEY. HMM?

41:44.202 --> 41:45.771
- IT SERVED
AS A GOOD REMINDER.

41:45.804 --> 41:47.305
- OF WHAT?

41:47.338 --> 41:50.909
- THAT HE'S A LOOSE CANNON
NOT TO BE TRUSTED

41:50.942 --> 41:53.278
AND DEFINITELY NOT THE KIND
OF PERSON I WANT

41:53.311 --> 41:54.746
AS THE FATHER OF MY CHILD.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.014
- OH, COME ON.

41:56.047 --> 41:57.282
- I'M SERIOUS.

41:57.315 --> 41:58.750
- NO, YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS.

41:58.784 --> 42:01.019
- YOU ACTUALLY EXPECT ME
TO HAVE A BABY

42:01.052 --> 42:02.020
WITH SOMEONE LIKE THAT?

42:02.053 --> 42:03.922
- I DID.

42:03.955 --> 42:06.057
- WELL, THAT WAS
YOUR DECISION.

42:06.091 --> 42:07.559
THIS ONE'S MINE.

I WANT SOMEONE ELSE.

HOW IT WAS GOING.

43:04.115 --> 43:05.884

43:05.917 --> 43:09.020
- ETHAN IS WITH HIS FRIENDS.

43:09.054 --> 43:10.255
- YOU SHOULD'VE BROUGHT HIM.

43:10.288 --> 43:11.857
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

43:11.890 --> 43:12.991
- MAYBE HE COULD'VE LEARNED
A FEW THINGS

43:13.024 --> 43:15.927
THEY DON'T TEACH IN COLLEGE.

43:18.730 --> 43:20.832
- I GUESS I BETTER GO.

43:20.866 --> 43:23.234
- TELL IAN WE MISSED HIM.

43:23.268 --> 43:26.137
- ONCE IN A LIFETIME,
IT'S THE GRANDE.

43:50.061 --> 43:51.296
- THANKS.

43:51.329 --> 43:55.000

- NO SHIT.

43:56.201 --> 43:58.436
- MUST HAVE COST A LOT.

43:58.469 --> 44:01.673
