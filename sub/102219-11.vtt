Not on the weekend
with a triple border patrol.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.493
We were going to bury it
and go back tomorrow.

11:42.576 --> 11:45.287
-Brilliant.
-Drive through customs and pick it up.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.289
Nobody's thought of doing that
on Gull Island.

11:47.373 --> 11:51.335
Yeah, smugglers, not a bunch of moms.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.003
Was that her angle?

11:55.005 --> 11:56.340
I need it back.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.633
What else you got?

11:59.969 --> 12:01.178
I don't know.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.179
Hmm.

12:03.472 --> 12:04.557
Come see me when you do.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.976
Who are you? My dad?

12:07.059 --> 12:10.688
I'm worried that she's going to
come up with something dumber.

12:10.771 --> 12:13.899
I'm not some kid
you caught with a case of beer.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.194
This isn't just beer, Ruby.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.322
I need to make that drop.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.075
And I need to keep you out of jail.

12:34.628 --> 12:35.921
[assistant] He's ready for you.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.845
[Nick] You don't look like you're here
for the sewer expansion meeting.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.847
I'm not sure I'd have a lot to offer.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.182
[chuckles] Come on.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.559
They're actually really interesting.

12:48.642 --> 12:51.020
-[Beth] Really?
-No, not at all.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.521
[both laughing]

12:52.605 --> 12:54.815
So what can I do for you, Elizabeth?

12:55.357 --> 12:56.192
[sighs]

12:56.734 --> 12:58.444
It's really stupid.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.738
Oh, I've heard it all.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.573
It might be crossing a line.

13:02.656 --> 13:03.949
I'm okay with that.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.578
It's kind of more of a favor.

13:07.661 --> 13:09.705
-Is it a parking ticket?
-No.

13:09.788 --> 13:13.042
Okay, because people hit me up
with that all the time…

13:13.125 --> 13:14.793
It's a trespassing ticket. [chuckles]

13:18.380 --> 13:19.673
Oh…

13:23.511 --> 13:24.512
Okay.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.682
So, what's next? Burning Man?

13:29.683 --> 13:30.893
It's a long story.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.604
Try me. I got time.

13:34.355 --> 13:38.275
It's more of a thing
for, you know, your brother-cousin…

13:40.528 --> 13:42.238
Him. [clears throat]

13:42.988 --> 13:45.407
…which I can't explain to a judge, so…

13:45.491 --> 13:48.369
[assistant over PA] <i>They're waiting</i>
<i>for you in the conference room.</i>

13:51.413 --> 13:52.331
You know what?

13:53.123 --> 13:54.291
You're busy.

13:54.375 --> 13:58.587
Look, it's just, um… I don't…
I don't like

13:59.129 --> 14:02.132
to get involved with his… things.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.093
I never should've asked.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.595
It just puts me in a bad place, you know?

14:07.638 --> 14:09.640
Go to your meeting. This never happened.

14:09.723 --> 14:12.351
-I'm an idiot.
-Wait, wait, wait. No, no. Hold on.

14:12.434 --> 14:13.352
Mmm…

14:15.396 --> 14:16.438
I'll do it.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.900
-You really don't have to.
-I really want to.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.486
Come on.

14:24.113 --> 14:24.989
Thank you.

14:25.072 --> 14:28.659
But you're going to
have to do something for me.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.247
Yeah, what?

14:33.998 --> 14:35.541
I'm gonna put you to work.

14:43.382 --> 14:46.260
-Please no.
-Just try it.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.304
I don't wanna release
whatever's trapped there.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.598
Don't you want to add rabies
to your hep A, B and C?

14:51.807 --> 14:52.892
I guess.

14:57.062 --> 14:57.897
[sighs]

15:00.024 --> 15:01.025
I'm scared.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.697
What is this?

15:14.580 --> 15:17.416
Yeah. I'm no Shakespeare, but I am sorry.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.254
Let me take you out.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.298
Why?

15:25.049 --> 15:27.051
To make up for the other night.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.888
-Where?
-Restaurant.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.056
A real one?

15:33.015 --> 15:34.308
You like French?

15:36.226 --> 15:37.269
[speaking French]

15:38.896 --> 15:40.314
-Ma'am.
-[chuckles softly]

15:41.774 --> 15:45.069
-This place is, like, legit fancy.
-Oh, I know.

15:45.152 --> 15:46.612
-Hey, Kev.
-Hey, Ange.

15:47.988 --> 15:50.532
-You come here often?
-All the time.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.995
You have a special table or something?

15:55.079 --> 15:56.080
Sort of.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.799
[indistinct chatter]

16:09.218 --> 16:10.970
Right this way, <i>madame.</i>

16:13.097 --> 16:15.516
-What is this?
-This is dinner.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.894
[Annie] What are you doing? Oh!

16:19.436 --> 16:21.397
-Are you high?
-A little bit.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.817
This, three-course meal right here.

16:24.900 --> 16:25.943
No way.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.027
One bite of each.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.697
[laughs incredulously] No, never.
Not in hell. No.

16:29.780 --> 16:31.782
I'll cook for you for a month.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.994
No, I don't want to be
eating your trash food.

16:35.077 --> 16:38.789
Your food from whatever grocery store
you waste your money at.

16:38.872 --> 16:40.207
No. Bye.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.168
Uh, Ben, too.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.464
Ben is not ever hungry.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.594
Well, he eats at his friend's house
so he doesn't have to at home.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.435
One bite.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.692
[inaudible conversation]

18:07.294 --> 18:11.090
-Well, I, uh, started as a prep chef…
-Mmm-hmm.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.884
…and became a line cook, and, uh…

18:14.468 --> 18:17.805
And now I just sort of
sub in whenever I need cash.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.767
Wow. Oh! I forgot to ask. What was the…

18:21.850 --> 18:24.728
It was like a little brown,
chewy sausage-y,

18:24.812 --> 18:26.980
garlicky butter thing on the toothpick?

18:27.064 --> 18:30.150
Ah, yes, yes, yes. That was escargot.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.903
Ah, escargot to you, <i>monsieur.</i>

18:33.612 --> 18:34.488
Snails.

18:35.614 --> 18:36.448
What?

18:36.532 --> 18:39.034
Yeah, see? Even from the garbage,
they're great, right?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.787
Ew, I never would've
eaten those even inside.

18:41.870 --> 18:44.498
-That, my friend, is exactly the point.
-[gagging]

18:44.581 --> 18:46.333
-It doesn't matter.
-Ugh!

18:46.959 --> 18:48.836
[Annie moaning softly]

19:01.515 --> 19:04.685
-Stop. Stop. What are you doing?
-I don't know.

19:04.768 --> 19:06.186
You can't do that.

19:07.479 --> 19:09.022
-Why not?
-Just…

19:09.106 --> 19:10.149
Because it's…

19:10.858 --> 19:12.276
Because we're roommates.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.903
-So?
-So, it's not…

19:16.071 --> 19:18.949
It's just… It's too easy.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.660
That wasn't in your rules.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.039
-We just… We can't, okay?
-[phone buzzes]

19:27.791 --> 19:29.168
-All right.
-[sighs] Um…

19:30.544 --> 19:32.379
[hesitating] I have to go.

19:32.462 --> 19:35.007
-I'll walk you.
-No, it's fine. Just stay.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.341
And enjoy the, um…

19:40.470 --> 19:42.139
Well, I'll see you at home.

19:44.766 --> 19:45.851
We get a PO box.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.978
Or whatever they call it up there.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.396
And just overnight it.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.023
[hip-hop music playing over speakers]

19:51.106 --> 19:52.024
Customs.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.903
Let them open it. All they'll see is
lots and lots of Huggies.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.155
Disguising, of course, the cash.

19:59.823 --> 20:02.784
Why would anybody want to
overnight diapers to Canada?

20:04.036 --> 20:06.580
They use those cloth ones up there.

20:08.749 --> 20:09.708
I'm out.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.586
You didn't want us involved
in the transport.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.296
-Next.
-[Beth] This is so low-risk.

20:14.379 --> 20:18.175
Till you're surrounded by Mounties
asking why your Pampers are so absorbant.

20:18.258 --> 20:19.259
Huggies.

20:21.553 --> 20:24.097
Hear me out. There's a mini submarine
called the <i>Dolphin.</i>

20:24.181 --> 20:26.058
I thought we weren't pitching this one.

20:26.141 --> 20:28.560
No, you weren't going to pitch this one.

20:28.644 --> 20:32.147
-It's like, twenty grand, Annie.
-It's a lifelong investment, Ruby.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.399
You wanted one
way before we started all this.

20:34.483 --> 20:38.779
It's just so simple. We blend in with
the marine life, pop up, ditch the cash--

20:38.862 --> 20:41.031
-This is ridiculous.
-Agreed.

20:41.114 --> 20:42.741
Why do we have to answer to you?

20:43.367 --> 20:44.618
Oh, um… [clears throat]

20:45.452 --> 20:48.163
How about my bag business,
my dancers, my club and, uh…

20:48.247 --> 20:49.790
What? My wife.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.084
He makes some good points.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.337
Are you gonna give us our money back?

20:55.420 --> 20:56.755
Not with these ideas.

20:58.131 --> 20:59.841
Well, let's just sell some bags, then.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.678
Uh, that's not gonna be necessary
this evening.

21:03.303 --> 21:04.304
Why is that?

21:04.388 --> 21:07.724
'Cause you'll need these guys
to help you with your drop.

21:10.686 --> 21:11.603
Hey.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.068
How's it going?

21:18.151 --> 21:21.780
Canadian dudes are the most respectful.

21:21.863 --> 21:22.948
Yeah?

21:23.031 --> 21:26.201
My nipple popped out too early,
and they all looked away.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.746
-So, are we good?
-Oh, yeah.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.415
They're not gonna ask questions.

21:31.498 --> 21:35.085
-That's it. You better… [vocalizes]
-Yeah!

21:35.794 --> 21:36.795
Yeah.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.380
Work all that.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.843
The girls also dance in Windsor.

21:44.803 --> 21:45.721
And?

21:45.804 --> 21:47.639
Fully nude. Twice the money.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.725
How does that help us?

21:50.559 --> 21:53.645
They're real tight with the border guards.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.605
[hip-hop music continues]

22:04.573 --> 22:07.034
Ugh, Canadians.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.378
Hey, how's it going?

22:18.462 --> 22:19.880
IDs, please.

22:28.764 --> 22:29.890
Have we met?

22:34.019 --> 22:35.437
I don't think so.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.774
Wait. No, you're Krystal's friend, right?

22:38.857 --> 22:40.567
-That's it.
-Oh, yeah.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.652
Krystal! You know Krystal.

22:42.736 --> 22:43.904
What's her real name?

22:44.780 --> 22:46.490
She's actually right behind us.

22:48.950 --> 22:49.951
[border guard] Oh.

22:50.660 --> 22:53.747
-How do you guys know her?
-We met at the gym.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.832
She teaches the most amazing Zumba class.

22:55.916 --> 22:57.709
She's so flexible, you know?

22:57.793 --> 23:00.837
[clears throat] Well,
I wouldn't exactly call us friends.

23:02.255 --> 23:03.215
Totally get it.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.760
Um, where are you guys headed today?

23:06.843 --> 23:08.553
We're gonna go see her dance.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.597
#womensupportingwomen.

23:14.017 --> 23:15.060
You should stop by.

23:15.143 --> 23:18.146
Tell your wife you got front row tickets
to the Windsor ballet.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.898
[chuckles] Well, I wish I could.

23:19.981 --> 23:23.443
I, um… I got my kid's violin concert, so…

23:24.069 --> 23:25.070
Next time, then.

23:27.614 --> 23:28.740
[clears throat]

23:29.366 --> 23:31.076
All right. Bringing anything in?

23:31.159 --> 23:32.994
-Nope.
-Just us.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.996
Great. Pull over and pop the trunk.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.873
But it's empty.

23:37.707 --> 23:39.042
Should be quick, then.

23:42.170 --> 23:43.380
Enjoy the show.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.281
All right. Good to go.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.001
It's, like, no biggie at all.

24:21.084 --> 24:24.421
-Well, we really appreciate it.
-Anything to help a friend.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.133
But we need our expenses covered.

24:29.092 --> 24:31.720
-I thought this was a favor.
-[giggles]

24:31.803 --> 24:33.180
And what expenses?

24:33.263 --> 24:37.100
You know, the cooler was super heavy
so it uses more gas.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.394
Okay, can we just do this already?

24:39.477 --> 24:40.520
Okay. How much?

24:41.188 --> 24:42.439
Five percent.

24:47.527 --> 24:50.989
-Of what?
-Just, like, whatever's in the cooler.

24:52.324 --> 24:55.577
-That's not our money.
-It's not our problem.

24:57.704 --> 25:00.040
Okay. Okay.

25:01.416 --> 25:02.667
Five percent.

25:06.046 --> 25:09.174
How do we give them 5%
of a cut we don't even have?

25:09.257 --> 25:11.635
How do we drop a cooler we don't have?

25:11.718 --> 25:13.428
I don't like this SUV.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.390
[Annie] Why? 'Cause it's silver?

25:19.267 --> 25:20.894
'Cause it hasn't moved.

25:20.977 --> 25:22.312
It is a parking lot.

25:24.022 --> 25:25.398
Let's roll, bitches.

25:27.400 --> 25:30.028
-[Dean] How bad is it?
-[Z] Remember Payne Stewart?

25:30.904 --> 25:33.573
-Wasn't he a golfer?
-Try U.S. Open champion.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.075
Okay.

25:35.158 --> 25:37.244
He's up in his private jet, right?

25:37.327 --> 25:38.495
On top of the world.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.122
Tower loses communication.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.833
So they scramble
some F-16s to check it out.

25:44.584 --> 25:47.337
Turns out the hull was breached.

25:48.171 --> 25:51.049

I told her that I'd give you guys
the place if she stays out of your life.

38:49.035 --> 38:51.162
And if she stays out of your life…

38:51.245 --> 38:53.331
-[inaudible]
-[melancholic music playing]

39:21.484 --> 39:24.028
Lady Luck ain't on your side tonight, huh?

39:29.075 --> 39:30.284
There was a problem.

39:31.410 --> 39:33.662
-Always is.
-And I had to get rid of it.

39:33.746 --> 39:37.249
-Never a solution.
-Well, I didn't have a lot of options.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.251
Oh, yeah?

39:42.129 --> 39:44.465
Or did the dice just not roll your way?

39:46.467 --> 39:49.553
-We were being followed.
-Yeah, by my people.

39:51.222 --> 39:54.183
Well, that would have been
really nice to know.

39:55.267 --> 39:56.977
They don't like to make a scene.

39:58.854 --> 40:00.523
But I don't mind so much.

40:05.111 --> 40:06.695
Well, someone else will.

40:08.864 --> 40:09.698
Hmm.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.701
What you got,
a guardian angel I don't know about?

40:20.084 --> 40:21.043
Maybe.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.589
Everyone, meet Beth.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.133
-Hi.
-Yes.

40:27.216 --> 40:28.092
Hi, Beth.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.386
She's gonna run things around here.

40:30.469 --> 40:33.889
-No, I'm helping.
-Just so we don't kill whatever we plant.

40:33.973 --> 40:34.849
[crowd giggles]

40:34.932 --> 40:38.310
Yeah. Ah, they're all yours.

40:39.520 --> 40:44.525
Okay. Well, I'm the new kid, so maybe
you guys can help me out a little bit.

40:44.608 --> 40:46.068
Show me what you've already started.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.321
[Z] Are you okay, man?

40:52.450 --> 40:53.534
I'm fine.

40:55.035 --> 40:56.412
You don't look so good.

40:57.246 --> 40:58.456
I just woke up.

41:01.333 --> 41:02.334
About time.

41:03.586 --> 41:04.587
[exhales softly]
