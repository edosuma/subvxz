T'LYN:
Outgoing communication.

01:37.358 --> 01:38.663
Provisional Lieutenant
Junior Grade T'Lyn

01:38.707 --> 01:41.318
to Captain Sokel
of the VCFSh'vhal.

01:41.362 --> 01:43.451
Due to the recent
unprovoked attacks

01:43.494 --> 01:45.366
on ships across the quadrant,

01:45.408 --> 01:48.064
the USSCerritos
is providing transport

01:48.108 --> 01:49.500
to three Betazoid diplomats.

01:49.544 --> 01:51.676
-Hey.
-T'LYN: These glorified
socialites

01:51.720 --> 01:54.940
just spent three weeks
attending parties on Angel I

01:54.984 --> 01:58.988
and now intend to
"keep the good times rolling"

01:59.031 --> 02:00.511
as we escort them to Risa.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.818
Despite the crew's enthusiasm,

02:02.861 --> 02:06.387
I find the Betazoids'
exuberance... disruptive.

02:06.430 --> 02:08.911
Oh, I love your
Starfleet carpeting.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.608
It's perfect to pass out on.

02:10.651 --> 02:11.740
[laughter]

02:11.783 --> 02:14.134
It's an honor
escorting you to Risa.

02:14.177 --> 02:16.962
Thank you, Captain,
but I can sense that you feel

02:17.006 --> 02:19.182
babysitting us
isn't your favorite mission.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.228
Oh, no, no, no, no,
I'm proud to...

02:21.271 --> 02:23.273
Shuttle a bunch
of sexy drunks around?

02:23.317 --> 02:24.274
[laughter]

02:24.318 --> 02:26.102
Katrot's just giving you
a hard time.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.756
We appreciate the lift.

02:27.799 --> 02:31.454
Particularly on a ship
with such sturdy officers.

02:31.499 --> 02:32.848
That's what I'm talking about.

02:32.891 --> 02:35.285
I get off bridge duty
at 1300 hours.

02:35.329 --> 02:36.329
Ugh, never mind.

02:36.373 --> 02:38.375
I like it when
they're hard to get.

02:38.418 --> 02:39.985
Oh, come on,
give me another chance.

02:40.029 --> 02:41.378
I can be distant
and unavailable.

02:41.422 --> 02:45.730
[purrs] Now, this is a woman
who seems withholding.

02:45.774 --> 02:49.647
Oh, uh, well, flattered,
but I'm happily married.

02:49.691 --> 02:51.040
Is he on the ship?

02:51.083 --> 02:53.347
-Uh...
-Cathiw, we've been here
for five minutes.

02:53.390 --> 02:56.959
Let's maybe check out our rooms
before you devour someone.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.308
Whoa. Hello.

02:58.352 --> 03:00.484
I'll devour whoever
I want, Dolorex,

03:00.528 --> 03:01.659
you sanctimonious buzzkill.

03:01.703 --> 03:03.183
Not to worry.

03:03.226 --> 03:05.707
We've been ordered to make sure
you have a good time.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.362
Let's top off those whalebones,
shall we? Lieutenant?

03:08.405 --> 03:11.930
Oh, I'll take another yard
of anything glowing and green.

03:11.974 --> 03:13.454
Thank you.

03:13.497 --> 03:16.021
T'LYN:
My posting here
is usually trying,

03:16.065 --> 03:17.414
but never more than now.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.982
I feel it necessary
to relay the severity

03:20.025 --> 03:21.766
of my circumstances.

03:21.810 --> 03:23.594
This is sickbay.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.466
-[sniffing]
-Hangover cures, prophylactics,

03:25.509 --> 03:27.468
well, it's all available
right here.

03:27.511 --> 03:31.341
Ah. I didn't realize there
was going to be a buffet today.

03:31.385 --> 03:32.864
-[laughter]
-Buffet?

03:32.908 --> 03:34.692
I wasn't informed of any...

03:34.736 --> 03:36.954
She's joking.
In the ancient past,

03:36.999 --> 03:39.697
-Caitians used to hunt
and eat Betazoids.
-Oh!

03:39.741 --> 03:43.310
Well, Dr. T'Ana,
these are our guests.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.312
Don't you consume anyone.

03:45.355 --> 03:47.314
Oh, don't worry,
that was centuries ago.

03:47.357 --> 03:49.228
Now we only eat
synthetic Betazoid.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.230
[growls]

03:50.273 --> 03:52.884

-BILLUPS: Ow!
-[gasps]

03:55.017 --> 03:56.105
Enough with the tour already.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.454
As this amazing hat I bought

03:57.498 --> 03:59.195
from some gal on Angel I says,

03:59.239 --> 04:01.502
"It's Romulan ale
o'clock somewhere."

04:01.545 --> 04:02.938
[laughs]

04:02.981 --> 04:04.244
You guys have a bar around here?

04:04.287 --> 04:05.375
[chuckles]
Why, yes.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.508
Oh, no need for those,
Lieutenant.

04:07.551 --> 04:10.162
We're already heading
for more cocktails.

04:10.206 --> 04:12.252
Time to get to surgery.

04:12.295 --> 04:13.862
Ooh, [bleep].

04:13.905 --> 04:16.125
T'LYN:
The Betazoids' attitudes
have inspired

04:16.168 --> 04:18.519
many in the crew to
"get the party started."

04:18.562 --> 04:20.999
Such infectious frivolity
would never be tolerated

04:21.043 --> 04:22.523
on a Vulcan ship.

04:22.566 --> 04:25.917
If reinstated, I will suppress
my own chaotic tendencies.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.311
It is only logical for
my punishment to conclude

04:28.355 --> 04:31.706
and that I return
to the Sh'vhal.

04:31.749 --> 04:33.447
[buzzes]

04:35.536 --> 04:36.885
[buzzes]

04:36.928 --> 04:39.104
Hey, T'Lyn, you coming
to this Betazoid party?

04:39.148 --> 04:40.541
I know you don't drink,
but there's gonna be

04:40.584 --> 04:42.412
a chocolate fountain
if you want to get wild.

04:42.456 --> 04:43.848
-[PADD buzzing]
-I do not understand
what you mean,

04:43.892 --> 04:45.633
but thank you
for the invitation.

04:45.676 --> 04:48.592
Oh, yeah, good luck getting
a message out right now.

04:48.636 --> 04:49.854
We're in full security blackout.

04:49.898 --> 04:52.335
No outgoing comms while
the 'Zoids are on board.

04:52.379 --> 04:53.945
No communications?

04:53.989 --> 04:56.383
And yet alcohol and merrymaking
are permitted?

04:56.426 --> 04:58.167
Everything about this ship
is illogical.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.343
[laughs] Yeah, totally.

05:00.387 --> 05:01.997
Well, if you change your mind,

05:02.040 --> 05:06.393
we'll be getting champagne-fully
buzzed in the bar. Come hang.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.309

-[beeping]
-Uh, starts with an "S."

05:22.147 --> 05:24.367
Damn it! Sleepy Merp.

05:24.411 --> 05:27.457
How could I forget that?
I'm such an idiot.

05:27.501 --> 05:28.457
Hey, pal, ease up.

05:28.502 --> 05:29.503
That's my friend
you're calling an idiot.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.287
Yeah, well, that's what I am

05:31.331 --> 05:32.941
when I can't remember every
single crew member's name.

05:32.984 --> 05:35.291
Ooh, you're being pretty hard
on yourself, Boims.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.728
Why don't you take a break
and come to the Betazoid party?

05:37.772 --> 05:40.470
I can't,
I'm a lieutenant junior grade.

05:40.514 --> 05:42.603
I can't just go around
not knowing everything.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.431
So then you'll have
to know this party.

05:44.474 --> 05:46.084
Or you'll be missing out.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.957
Nice try, but I'll come
if I memorize everyone.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.915
-Then I'll have earned it.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.221

Lieutenant Shaxs, I think
I have a candidate for...

05:55.920 --> 05:58.619
the program.

06:00.534 --> 06:01.665
[soft exhale]

06:01.709 --> 06:02.797
It would be illogical

06:02.840 --> 06:05.365
to attempt to send
this message again.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.413
However, it would be logical

06:10.457 --> 06:13.503
to inquire when communications
will reopen.

06:14.765 --> 06:16.724
She said I was too into it
and she shrugged me off.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.509
It's like, could she
not see these gains?

06:19.553 --> 06:20.858

06:31.652 --> 06:33.610
you stupid
[bleep]ing replicator.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.483
This barely even tastes like
it's been in my mother's mouth!

06:36.526 --> 06:37.745
Oh, my God, isn't
this party the best?

06:37.788 --> 06:39.442
I love everyone and everything!

06:39.486 --> 06:41.401
-Yeah!
-T'Lyn!
-[gasps]

06:41.444 --> 06:42.750
Yes, you came. Whoo!

06:42.793 --> 06:44.491
This [bleep]ing rules, yes.

06:44.534 --> 06:46.449
Holy [bleep], [bleep] yeah.
Did you send your message?

06:46.493 --> 06:48.843
No, I am here to ask
if there is an estimate

06:48.886 --> 06:51.323
to when communications
will be back online.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.455
You came to talk to me?

06:52.499 --> 06:54.544
If you can resolve
my query, then yes.

06:54.588 --> 06:57.025
I've dreamed about this moment!

06:57.068 --> 06:58.635
It is not "a moment."

06:58.679 --> 06:59.854
Usually you're giving me
a friendship bracelet

06:59.897 --> 07:01.464
or we're getting
matching tattoos,

07:01.508 --> 07:02.944
but I'm still so happy!

07:02.987 --> 07:04.554
Okay, D, calm down.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.991
Wait, is everyone
getting weird all of a sudden?

07:07.035 --> 07:08.689
Why am I yelling?!

07:08.732 --> 07:10.473
This crew is always weird
and yelling.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.562
Yeah, baby,
'cause we're number one!

07:12.606 --> 07:15.522
-Enjoy hell, replicator.
-[grunts]

07:16.784 --> 07:18.612
-[cheers and applause]
-But perhaps...

07:18.655 --> 07:21.658
you are correct, there do appear
to be more emotional outbursts

07:21.702 --> 07:24.095
than I have previously observed.

07:24.139 --> 07:25.619
Wow, Captain Freeman,

07:25.662 --> 07:28.839
I didn't know Starfleet had
this kind of party in them.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.711
We don't.

07:30.754 --> 07:33.061
People, you are
Starfleet officers.

07:33.104 --> 07:36.020
Pull it together
and stop embarrassing me

07:36.064 --> 07:39.023
in front of the Betazoids.
I want them to think we're cool.

07:39.067 --> 07:42.505
This is as controlled
as I can get!

07:42.549 --> 07:45.595
We can't stop the party now,
it's just getting started!

07:45.639 --> 07:48.816
I'm gonna drop us out of warp so
we don't get to Risa too soon.

07:48.859 --> 07:52.036
What? No, Ensign Barnes,
stop right there!

07:52.080 --> 07:53.560
[booing]

07:53.603 --> 07:54.735
-Boo!
-Hey, stop that!

07:54.778 --> 07:56.606
You can't boo your captain.

07:56.650 --> 07:57.955
-[booing]
-Good God.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.304
Why do I even care?

07:59.348 --> 08:00.871
This isn't right.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.525
Something must be affecting us.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.527
[cheering, laughing]

08:14.450 --> 08:17.453
Huh. How have I never been
to this part of the ship before?

08:17.497 --> 08:18.933
It's so quiet over here.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.412
Easy, baby bear.

08:20.456 --> 08:24.634
I just want us isolated
from any... interruptions.

08:24.678 --> 08:25.809
Oh, God, what am I gonna learn?

08:25.853 --> 08:26.810
[gasps]

08:26.854 --> 08:28.943
Tsunkatse?

08:29.987 --> 08:34.731
Worf. Worf, Worf.
Torn between worlds.

08:34.775 --> 08:35.818
A warrior.

08:35.863 --> 08:38.692
No, a farm boy.

08:38.735 --> 08:41.216
Hope you can handle
slam poetry, Lieutenant.

08:41.259 --> 08:44.567
The son of Mogh,
clang goes the bat'leth

08:44.611 --> 08:46.830
against the armor
of your heart!

08:46.874 --> 08:49.964
-[arguing indistinctly]
-[glass shattering]

08:50.007 --> 08:52.662
[laughter]

08:52.706 --> 08:54.316
Why won't anyone listen to me?

08:54.359 --> 08:55.883
I'm the captain, damn it!

08:55.926 --> 08:57.798
I say we lock all these fools
in the brig

08:57.841 --> 09:00.278
until they calm
the [bleep] down,

09:00.322 --> 09:01.802
including me.

09:01.845 --> 09:05.109
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug, chug...

09:05.153 --> 09:06.981
Captain, I believe
it is plausible

09:07.024 --> 09:08.939
that the heightened
emotional state of the crew

09:08.983 --> 09:10.985
is being caused by our guests.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.813
The Betazoids?
[stammers] No way.

09:12.856 --> 09:15.816
They're so nice.
Dolorex? She said I'm hot.

09:15.859 --> 09:18.862
You frigging are.
I got a hot mom.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.734
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.257
I tried something new
with my hair.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.695
Zanthi fever is known to infect
Betazoids of their age.

09:25.739 --> 09:28.785
It causes empathetic abilities
to unintentionally broadcast,

09:28.829 --> 09:31.048
heightening the emotions
of those around them.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.790
Wow, okay, yes,
that does kind of sound

09:33.834 --> 09:35.749
-exactly like what's happening.
-[laughter]

09:35.792 --> 09:38.490
Perhaps if we opened
communications, we could contact

09:38.534 --> 09:40.928
-a Betazoid doctor.
-We can't risk that.
Are you crazy?

09:40.971 --> 09:43.757
[groans] Sorry, what I mean is,

09:43.800 --> 09:46.847
Dr. T'ana will have
to handle it herself.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.196
[screeching]

09:48.239 --> 09:50.024
-I am unsure of her
current efficacy.
-[groans]

09:50.067 --> 09:54.550
Well, if it isn't the most
eligible captain in Starfleet.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.771
Hey, is it just me or
is it incredibly horny in here?

09:57.814 --> 10:00.948
Still married. Would you ladies
mind joining me in sickbay?

10:00.991 --> 10:04.342
My provisional lieutenant thinks
you're telepathically ill.

10:04.386 --> 10:06.344
That is not how
I would have stated it.

10:06.388 --> 10:07.781
But the captain is accurate.

10:07.824 --> 10:09.347
KATROT:
Telepathically ill?

10:09.391 --> 10:10.958
What the hell
is she talking about?

10:11.001 --> 10:12.916
CATHIW: She's on to us.
We need to do something.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.483
DOLOREX:
Stand down.
Let's see where this leads.

10:14.526 --> 10:17.181
We'd be happy to move
this party to sickbay.

10:17.225 --> 10:20.315
As long as we can take
our drinks. [laughs]

10:20.358 --> 10:21.969
[tricorder whirring]

10:22.012 --> 10:25.625
This morsel-- I mean Betazoid--
is deliciously pathogen-free.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.627
"Pathogen"? What are you
scanning for?

10:27.670 --> 10:29.063
Oh, just standard stuff.

10:29.106 --> 10:32.849
Goronian measles, Alterian
flaking, Zanthi fever...

10:32.893 --> 10:34.111
BETAZOIDS:
Zanthi fever?

10:34.155 --> 10:36.897
Listen, we're all gals
of a certain age here.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.550
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

10:38.594 --> 10:40.509
We're not old enough to be
affected by Zanthi fever.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.424
CATHIW:
Oh, this is just an excuse
to lock us up.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.948
KATROT:
Cathiw's right.
Our cover's blown.

10:44.992 --> 10:46.602
DOLOREX:
What is wrong with you two?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.691
Get ahold of yourselves.
Remember your training.

10:48.735 --> 10:49.997
CATHIW:
You remember yours.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.781
-We need to act.
-[whirring]

10:51.825 --> 10:54.436
Well, that's all of 'em.
No Zanthi fever detected.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.699
Wonderful. What say
we get back to the festivities?

10:56.743 --> 10:58.832
You're not going anywhere.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.790
-Darling, what's the matter?
-[nervous laugh]

11:00.834 --> 11:03.401
Captain, these diplomats
are our guests.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.316
Are you telling me
it's just a coincidence

11:05.360 --> 11:07.710
that you three showed up
right when my crew

11:07.754 --> 11:08.798
started losing their minds?

11:08.842 --> 11:10.234
Captain, they scanned clear.

11:10.278 --> 11:11.975
Well, then they're doing
something else.

11:12.019 --> 11:13.890
-We are not.
-My crew and I

11:13.934 --> 11:15.152
don't just get all emotional

11:15.196 --> 11:17.938
for no reason.
Something is going on here.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.766
And until we figure it out,

11:19.809 --> 11:21.811
you three are confined
to quarters.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.073
Mom, they haven't done anything.

11:23.117 --> 11:24.248
That's an order!

11:24.292 --> 11:26.947
Escort them now!

11:26.990 --> 11:29.079
DOLOREX:
Enough's enough.
Drop the cover.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.168
MARINER:
Whoa, what the hell?

[grunting]

11:37.697 --> 11:39.829
[grunting]

11:40.917 --> 11:43.267
Sorry, Captain,
but the party's over.

11:43.311 --> 11:44.660
You're coming with us.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.489
I knew it. See? See?
You areup to something!

11:47.532 --> 11:49.665
I'm good at my job!

11:49.709 --> 11:51.058
[rhythmic grunts]

11:51.101 --> 11:54.104
Uh, you're hungry? You're trying
to hold a little bird.

11:54.148 --> 11:56.540
Uh, shrinking.
Ooh, someone who shrinks.

11:56.585 --> 11:57.542
[grunting]

11:57.586 --> 11:59.544
SHAXS:
Bucket?

11:59.588 --> 12:00.981
-Swimming in a bucket!
-[sighs]

12:01.024 --> 12:02.939
It's Constable Odo
from Deep Space 9.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.854
Sokath, his eyes open.

12:04.898 --> 12:05.855
-[cheering]
-All right!

12:05.899 --> 12:07.509
What's wrong, Lieutenant?

12:07.552 --> 12:10.730
You're crushing Starfleet
Security Officer Charades.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.470
I don't know, I guess
I was hoping

12:12.514 --> 12:13.994
I'd be training to kick butt,

12:14.037 --> 12:16.561
not playing games
or listening to Worf poems.

12:16.605 --> 12:19.129
Haubold's poem has come
a long way in workshop,

12:19.173 --> 12:21.218
and training takes
different forms.

12:21.262 --> 12:23.481
Wait, is this a... test?

12:23.525 --> 12:24.874
[gasps] It is, isn't it?

12:24.918 --> 12:27.442
-Well...
-Kiai! [grunting]

12:27.485 --> 12:28.791
[grunting] I got you.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.837
Okay, you got me.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.186
Uh, good work.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.057
Ah, I knew it.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.451
Now that you have
passed the test,

12:36.494 --> 12:38.018
it's time for...

12:38.061 --> 12:39.802
the ritual.

12:40.890 --> 12:43.675
Two sacred security officer
challenges

12:43.719 --> 12:44.807
are contained within.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.418
You must choose one to complete.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.901
Ah, a puzzle
and some tarot cards.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.947
-What kind of choice is that?
-[gasps]

12:53.990 --> 12:56.253
-He chose both!
-[cheering]

12:56.297 --> 12:57.864
[groans]

12:57.907 --> 13:00.780
Don't get any ideas, Captain.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.085
We're officers of the BIA.

13:02.129 --> 13:03.870
Betazed Intelligence?

13:03.913 --> 13:04.914
But we offered to help you.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.960
Yeah, and then you tried
to lock us up.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.921
[grunting]

13:11.965 --> 13:14.794
Bridge crew! [grunts]
Take them down!

13:15.316 --> 13:16.926
[grunting]

13:22.497 --> 13:26.283
Ooh, I sense that you both are
deeply attracted to each other.

13:26.327 --> 13:28.024
-What? I, uh...
-I mean...

13:28.068 --> 13:29.852
-Unless...
-I wouldn't be averse to...

13:29.896 --> 13:31.723
-Look out!
-[grunts]

13:31.767 --> 13:33.377
I told you not to try anything.

13:33.421 --> 13:36.380
Betazed is in the Federation.
We're allies.

13:36.424 --> 13:37.425
Why are you doing this?

13:37.468 --> 13:39.035
You're the one
trying to frame us

13:39.079 --> 13:40.776
for amplifying
the crew's emotions.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.517
You are amplifying our emotions!

13:42.560 --> 13:45.607
No, we aren't. Our emotions
are all over the place, too.

13:45.650 --> 13:48.784
Why do you think I want
to kiss Katrot?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.046
You have to be manipulating us.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.700
It's the only explanation.

13:51.743 --> 13:52.832
Why would we?

13:52.875 --> 13:53.920
We're on a multi-planet mission

13:53.963 --> 13:55.399
to telepathically look for clues

13:55.443 --> 13:57.010
that can explain the attacks
in the quadrant.

13:57.053 --> 13:58.968
God, I need a drink!

13:59.012 --> 14:01.014
Katrot, be silent.
Our cover's blown.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.103
We have to take the Cerritos
back to Betazed

14:03.146 --> 14:04.931
so we can sort this out
as soon as possible.

14:04.974 --> 14:08.108
FREEMAN:
[gasps] That route take us
through the Neutral Zone.

14:08.151 --> 14:09.413
The Romulans will destroy us.

14:09.457 --> 14:10.980
Well, you should've
thought of that

14:11.024 --> 14:12.503
before you tried
to take us prisoner.

14:12.547 --> 14:14.636
Oh, you won't
get away with this.

14:14.679 --> 14:18.509
My crew will realize
something's off any second now.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.425
CROWD [chanting]:
Go, go, go, go, go, go...

14:21.469 --> 14:23.123

those party girls into brisket.

-Hey, Doc,

14:36.963 --> 14:38.007
wait, we should stick together.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.966
Mama's eating good tonight!

14:40.009 --> 14:41.184
We got to stop her.
She took an oath

14:41.228 --> 14:42.707
not to consume patients.

14:42.751 --> 14:45.710
T'LYN:
The doctor's tricorder
is still scanning.

14:45.754 --> 14:47.190
Wait, wait, wait.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.409
That can't be right.
According to this,

14:48.452 --> 14:51.064
the source of all
this psychic disturbance...

14:51.107 --> 14:52.195
Is me.

14:52.239 --> 14:54.154
[beeping]

14:58.636 --> 15:01.117
How can you be the source?
Vulcans can't get Zanthi fever.

15:01.161 --> 15:04.207
No, but we do have
similar conditions.

15:04.251 --> 15:05.730
Bendii syndrome, for instance,

15:05.774 --> 15:08.168
creates involuntary
telepathic projections.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.953
But it is mostly observed
in the elderly,

15:10.997 --> 15:13.173
while I am only 62 years of age.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.217
Yeah, but you could be hav--

15:14.261 --> 15:15.740
also, 62, you look great,
by the way--

15:15.784 --> 15:17.090
you could be having
a quarter-life crisis.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.569
You know,
when Boimler turned 25,

15:18.613 --> 15:20.832
he got so worked up,
he grew a mustache.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.704
[sighs] It was sad
and hilarious.

15:22.747 --> 15:25.925
-Vulcans do not get "worked up."
-We'll have to figure
it out later.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.536
I have to rescue my mommy.

15:33.410 --> 15:36.283
We'll be in the Neutral Zone
in five minutes, Dolorex.

15:36.326 --> 15:39.982
Yep, no need to update me
with every tiny detail, Cathiw.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.070
No!

15:41.114 --> 15:43.464
You can't let
the Romulans take me!

15:43.507 --> 15:45.553
They'll torture out
all my intel.

15:45.596 --> 15:46.641
What intel?

15:46.684 --> 15:48.208
Oh, uh, I mean...

15:48.251 --> 15:49.252
Nothing.

15:49.296 --> 15:51.254
I'm just being emotional.

of a rebirth.

Every card's a rebirth.

Wish I'd draw a card
that made me kick some ass.

than kicking ass.

Well, it seems like
there's nothing

Where's the toughness?
Where's the grit?

all you guys do is play games.

16:49.573 --> 16:51.314
I do not have
a drinking problem.

I am not Vulcan enough.

A true Vulcan would
never allow their emotions
