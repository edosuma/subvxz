WEBVTT

00:02.627 --> 00:03.878
{\an8}-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.961 --> 00:05.880
{\an8}IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.924
{\an8}- ROCK AND ROLL HISTORY
WILL BE MADE

00:08.007 --> 00:09.467
{\an8}IN CLEVELAND THIS WEEK

00:09.551 --> 00:11.553
{\an8}WHEN SEXY ROCKER JOHNNY REVERE

00:11.636 --> 00:13.930
{\an8}REUNITES WITH HIS
BAND MATE, DRAGO,

00:14.013 --> 00:19.060
{\an8}SHOWN HERE DURING THEIR
1988 SIMPATICO TOUR.

00:19.144 --> 00:22.564
{\an8}UNFORTUNATELY,
ONE WEEK INTO SIMPATICO,

00:22.647 --> 00:26.609
{\an8}JOHNNY AND DRAGO BROKE UP
DUE TO CREATIVE DIFFERENCES.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.612
{\an8}THEY HATE EACH OTHER.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.823
{\an8}BUT NOW THE TWO ROCKERS
HAVE AGREED

00:31.906 --> 00:33.825
{\an8}TO PUT ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES
TO PERFORM

00:33.908 --> 00:36.911
{\an8}A <i> WE ARE THE WORLD</i> TYPE SONG
PROMOTING THE IDEA

00:36.995 --> 00:38.913
{\an8}THAT EVERYONE SHOULD JUST STOP
YELLING AT EACH OTHER

00:38.997 --> 00:40.749
{\an8}AND GET ALONG.

00:40.832 --> 00:43.835
{\an8}IT'S CALLED <i> COOL AID:</i>
<i>A TIME TO CHILL.</i>

00:45.879 --> 00:47.630
{\an8}AND I'LL HAVE
EXCLUSIVE ACCESS

00:47.714 --> 00:49.257
{\an8}TO THE STORY
BEHIND THE STORY

00:49.340 --> 00:51.426
{\an8}BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO KNOW

00:51.509 --> 00:55.346
{\an8}THE LUCKY LADY
DATING JOHNNY REVERE.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.849
{\an8}THAT'S RIGHT,
THE OHIO PART OF AMERICA.

00:57.932 --> 01:00.643
{\an8}IT'S ME.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.648
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:05.732 --> 01:07.108
- OH, JUST CHILLING GLASSES.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.027
JOHNNY LIKES
HIS MARTINI COLD

01:09.110 --> 01:10.820
AND HIS VICTORIA HOT.

01:10.904 --> 01:11.821
- [chuckles]

01:11.905 --> 01:13.156
- THIS <i> COOL AID</i> THING

01:13.239 --> 01:15.033
HAS AN AMAZING LINEUP
OF MUSICIANS.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.659
- [gasps]
OH, MY GOD.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.369
DAVID GATES
IS GONNA BE THERE?

01:18.453 --> 01:20.163
- WHO?
- DAVID GATES FROM BREAD.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.664
OH, I MUST HAVE LISTENED
TO <i> THE BEST OF BREAD</i>

01:21.748 --> 01:23.750
A MILLION TIMES
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.711
- YOU WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL
IN AN ELEVATOR?

01:32.300 --> 01:34.344
- BREAD IS NOT ELEVATOR MUSIC.

01:34.427 --> 01:37.096
IT'S SOFT ROCK.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.139
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

01:38.223 --> 01:38.973
- OH, SURE.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.351
SOFT ROCK ISN'T
ALL UP IN YOUR FACE

01:41.434 --> 01:45.313
LIKE ELEVATOR MUSIC.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.023
- I'M COMING WITH YOU
TO THE RECORDING SESSION.

01:47.106 --> 01:48.858
I WANT DAVID GATES
TO SIGN MY GUITAR.

01:48.942 --> 01:52.028
- I'M COMING TOO.
MAYBE SOMEONE WILL DISCOVER ME.

01:52.111 --> 01:55.031
I STILL DREAM OF BECOMING
A PROFESSIONAL SINGER.

01:55.114 --> 01:57.325
- AND I DREAM
ABOUT CC SABATHIA

01:57.408 --> 01:59.744
COMING BACK TO THE INDIANS.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.205
NEITHER ONE OF 'EM'S
GONNA HAPPEN.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.540
- SERIOUSLY.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.999
I'M BETTER THAN VERENA.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.709
STUPID MARIAH CAREY WANNABE.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.419
- WELL, DOESN'T VERENA HAVE,
LIKE, A SIX-OCTAVE RANGE?

02:09.503 --> 02:11.923
- IF COMPUTERS CAN DIGITALLY
TAKE OUT A RIB

02:12.006 --> 02:13.675
FOR A PHOTO SHOOT,
THEY CAN DO ANYTHING.

02:13.758 --> 02:16.886
- I TOLD YOU THAT
IN CONFIDENCE.

02:16.970 --> 02:17.887
[doorbell rings]

02:17.971 --> 02:19.013
- OH, THAT MUST BE JOHNNY.

02:19.097 --> 02:20.890
- DO YOU WANT US TO STALL HIM
WHILE YOU GET READY?

02:20.974 --> 02:23.226
- NO, THAT'S WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP NOW.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.103
WE CAN JUST BE OURSELVES.

02:34.654 --> 02:35.697
GUESS WHO'S HOT FOR TEACHER.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.866
I...

02:43.454 --> 02:45.456
OH, I WAS EXPECTING
SOMEONE ELSE.

02:45.540 --> 02:49.294
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY
SOME CHOCOLATE?

02:49.377 --> 02:50.962
- DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT I COULD EAT CANDY

02:51.045 --> 02:53.590
AND FIT INTO AN OUTFIT
LIKE THIS?

02:53.673 --> 02:56.426
- WHY <i> ARE</i> YOU
DRESSED LIKE THAT?

02:56.509 --> 02:58.761
- WELL, I JUST GOT HOME
FROM SCHOOL,

02:58.845 --> 03:01.431
AND, UH, HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO PUT ON

03:01.514 --> 03:04.267
MY PLAY CLOTHES YET.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.936
OH, AND THERE'S
MY PLAYMATE NOW.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.771
- HI, VICTORIA.
- HI, JOHNNY.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.356
I HAD A "HOT FOR TEACHER" LINE,

03:10.440 --> 03:13.943
BUT NOW THAT SEEMS
WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE.

03:14.027 --> 03:17.655
- UH, WE NEED TO TALK.

03:17.739 --> 03:18.656
- UH-OH.

03:18.740 --> 03:22.118
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA NEED
SOME CHOCOLATE.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.131
- WELL, NATALYA AND I
HAVE BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER

03:35.214 --> 03:36.633
FOR SIX MONTHS.

03:36.716 --> 03:37.800
{\an8}- HOW OLD IS SHE?

03:37.884 --> 03:39.135
{\an8}- THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

03:39.218 --> 03:42.305
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.
HOW YOUNG IS SHE?

03:42.388 --> 03:44.140
{\an8}- 22.
- [gasps]

03:44.223 --> 03:47.977
{\an8}THAT'S MORE THAN HALF
MY...HEIGHT.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.355
{\an8}SO, UH, HOW DID YOU MEET?

03:50.438 --> 03:52.065
{\an8}- SHE'S A BACKUP SINGER
IN MY BAND.

03:52.148 --> 03:53.816
{\an8}- [laughing]
OH.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.318
{\an8}OKAY, SO IT'S NOTHING.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.488
{\an8}NO, IT WOULD BE LIKE ME
SLEEPING WITH AN EXTRA,

03:58.571 --> 04:01.449
{\an8}LIKE "COP #1"
OR "HUNKY TRUCKER."

04:01.532 --> 04:03.409
{\an8}- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.953
{\an8}- OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.288
{\an8}YOU AND I HAVE
AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.373
{\an8}WHAT YOU DO ON THE ROAD

04:08.456 --> 04:10.959
{\an8}OR WHAT I DO ON THE SET
OF THE LIFETIME ORIGINAL MOVIE

04:11.042 --> 04:14.337
{\an8}<i>TRUCK STOP WAITRESS:</i>
<i>THE ALISON MCCLANEY STORY</i>

04:14.420 --> 04:17.507
{\an8}HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH US.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.801
{\an8}- I'M GONNA ASK HER
TO MARRY ME.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.429
{\an8}- A BACKUP SINGER?

04:23.513 --> 04:25.306
{\an8}- WELL, SHE REPEATS
EVERYTHING I SAY.

04:25.390 --> 04:29.018
{\an8}IT'S VERY AFFIRMING.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.853
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, PLEASE, JUST NO--
NO JOKES RIGHT NOW.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.855
{\an8}I'M KIND OF REELING HERE.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.190
{\an8}- OKAY, I'M SORRY.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.025
{\an8}WHAT YOU AND I HAVE
IS INCREDIBLE.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.193
{\an8}BUT ALL YOU WANT
IS A WEEKEND HERE

04:37.276 --> 04:38.444
{\an8}AND A NIGHT THERE.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.863
{\an8}- I KNOW, THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT
SO EXCITING.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.866
{\an8}- YEAH, AND--
AND THIS OUTFIT YOU'RE WEARING

04:43.950 --> 04:46.244
{\an8}ISN'T MAKING THIS
ANY EASIER.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.121
BUT I NEED MORE THAN THAT.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.331
NATALYA WANTS TO BE THERE
EVERY DAY.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.541
I MEAN, I ASKED YOU
TO MARRY ME,

04:51.624 --> 04:52.542
AND YOU TURNED ME DOWN.

04:52.625 --> 04:53.876
- WELL, OF COURSE.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.211
I CAN'T GO ON THE ROAD

04:55.294 --> 04:57.046
AND--AND TRAVEL AROUND
WITH YOU IN A BUS

04:57.130 --> 04:59.716
AND--AND STAY IN MOTELS
AND--AND ALL THAT LOUD MUSIC.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.926
I MEAN, THAT IS
A YOUNG WOMAN'S GAME.

05:03.302 --> 05:07.056
OH.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.225
[crying]
I'M DEVASTATED.

05:09.308 --> 05:12.061
LOOK AT ME.
I'M ACTUALLY EATING CHOCOLATE.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.564
AND IT'S THE LOWEST FORM
OF CHOCOLATE.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.357
<i>FUNDRAISER</i> CHOCOLATE.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.572
- HONEY.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.907
I'M SO SORRY.
I KNOW IT HURTS.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.242
- YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH JOHNNY
WASN'T ALWAYS THERE,

05:26.325 --> 05:27.744
I THOUGHT HE'D ALWAYS
BE THERE.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.912
HE WAS LIKE
MY SAFETY NET.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.748
- MAYBE KNOWING
YOU HAD A SAFETY NET

05:31.831 --> 05:34.417
WAS HOLDING YOU BACK
FROM FINDING SOMEONE WONDERFUL.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.293
- THAT'S JUST SOMETHING

05:35.376 --> 05:38.087
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE
SAFETY NETS SAY.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.548
- THAT'S TRUE.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.135
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:44.218 --> 05:46.387
THIS IS CRAZY.
NO MORE WALLOWING.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.472
I HAVE GOT TO MOVE ON.

05:47.555 --> 05:48.556
- BRAVO, VICTORIA.

05:48.639 --> 05:51.601
- AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT
IS TO GET REVENGE.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.103
- I ALWAYS "BRAVO" TOO SOON.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.396
- I KNOW.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.981
I NEED TO GO
TO JOHNNY'S RECORDING TOMORROW

05:57.065 --> 05:58.441
WITH A NEW BOYFRIEND,

05:58.524 --> 06:00.276
SOMEONE WHO TRUMPS ROCK STAR.

06:00.359 --> 06:01.986
- HOW ABOUT GEORGE CLOONEY?

06:02.070 --> 06:03.279
- OOH, THAT'S GOOD.
- MM-HMM.

06:03.362 --> 06:07.533
- BUT DOES MOVIE STAR
BEAT ROCK STAR?

06:07.617 --> 06:10.411
- YES, THAT'S THE ONLY PROBLEM
WITH CHOOSING GEORGE CLOONEY.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.248
LOOK, IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE

06:14.332 --> 06:16.167
WHO WILL REALLY
MAKE JOHNNY MAD--

06:16.250 --> 06:17.919
AS MAD AT YOU
AS HE IS WITH DRAGO.

06:18.002 --> 06:20.296
- [gasps]
THAT'S IT! DRAGO!

06:20.379 --> 06:23.674
OH, THAT IS GONNA KILL JOHNNY
TO SEE ME WITH HIM.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.635
GUESS WHO'S HOT FOR TEACHER.

06:25.718 --> 06:26.928
- [mumbling]
IT'S CHAOS OUT HERE.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.305
I WAS TOTALLY LIKE...
AND GOOD NEWS!

06:29.388 --> 06:30.389
GOT SO EXCITED,
OUT OF THE BLUE...

06:30.473 --> 06:32.934
KNEE SOCKS.

06:33.017 --> 06:34.435
- OH, MY GOSH.

06:34.519 --> 06:37.563
OF COURSE I'LL BE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

06:46.405 --> 06:48.449
- LOOK, I'M SORRY.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.201
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE HELL
DRAGO IS.

06:50.284 --> 06:51.828
- OH, I'M SURE
HE HAD A GOOD EXCUSE.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.162
PERHAPS HE WAS OUT LATE
LAST NIGHT

06:53.246 --> 06:55.081
WITH SOME BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

06:55.164 --> 06:57.542
A WOMAN WHOSE IDENTITY
COULD BE SURPRISING

06:57.625 --> 07:00.837
AND POTENTIALLY DISTURBING
TO YOU.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.130
- I'M HERE!

07:02.213 --> 07:03.297
I'M HERE!

07:03.381 --> 07:05.716
HISTORY TO BE MADE.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.176
WHERE'S JOHNNY REVERE?

07:07.260 --> 07:09.637
- I'M JOHNNY, YOU IDIOT.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.806
- WHOA! GEE!

07:11.889 --> 07:15.810
WHOA, TIME IS CRUEL.
JUST CRAGGY.

07:15.893 --> 07:18.312
- I GOT THESE BAGS
CARRYING YOUR DRUNKEN ASS,

07:18.396 --> 07:19.814
LIKE I'M ABOUT TO DO
RIGHT NOW.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.899
- OKAY, GUYS, GUYS.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.860
LET'S DO THIS THING.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.027
- WELCOME, EVERYBODY.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.821
<i>A TIME TO CHILL</i> IS A SONG

07:26.904 --> 07:31.033
TO PROMOTE PEACE AND BROTHERHOOD
IN THESE CONTENTIOUS TIMES.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.035
- THE WORLD NEEDS...

07:33.119 --> 07:34.829
IF WE COULD ALL JUST GET...

07:34.912 --> 07:36.998
I MEAN, TAKE...

07:37.081 --> 07:39.000
I MEAN,
THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.377
RIGHT?

07:41.460 --> 07:43.546
- WELL SAID, DRAGO.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.381
- ANYWAY, I CAN'T THINK
OF A BETTER PROJECT

07:45.464 --> 07:46.549
TO BRING US BACK TOGETHER.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.467
- AND SPEAKING OF TOGETHER,

07:48.551 --> 07:50.386
I KNOW THAT AMERICA
WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW

07:50.469 --> 07:51.387
THAT YOU HAVE
A NEW GIRLFRIEND

07:51.470 --> 07:53.723
WHO'S YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.184
SO IT'S NOT CREEPY
AT ALL.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.560
AND--AND DRAGO,

07:57.643 --> 08:00.521
UH, I HEAR THAT YOU HAVE
A NEW SPECIAL SOMEONE

08:00.605 --> 08:01.522
IN YOUR LIFE.

08:01.606 --> 08:02.732
- OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.359
SHOUT IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.028
VISELNUB.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.908
- I'LL JUST GIVE EVERYONE
OUT THERE IN TV LAND A HINT.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.075
IT'S ME.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.076
- WHAT?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.370
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.914
VISELNUB.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.374
- UH, VIC-TO-RIA.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.210
- VISELNUB.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.086
- VIC--
- VISEL--

08:24.170 --> 08:26.047
- TORIA.
- NUB.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.548
- VICTORIA.
- VISELNUB.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.218
- OH, ISN'T HE ADORABLE?

08:30.301 --> 08:33.054
OKAY, FRANK, THAT'S ENOUGH.
I THINK WE GOT IT.

08:33.136 --> 08:34.429
- LOOK, VICTORIA.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.765
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND
TO LIKE THIS JERK

08:36.849 --> 08:37.975
JUST TO GET BACK AT ME.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.602
- I'M NOT PRETENDING.

08:39.684 --> 08:42.270
NO, HE AND I HAVE HAD A THING
FOR EACH OTHER FOR YEARS.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.066
- NUMBER ONE
IN ME SPANK BANK.

08:45.149 --> 08:48.152
- AND YOU IN MINE,
MY LOVE.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.283
- WHO IN THIS ROOM
DO YOU THINK

08:54.367 --> 08:56.494
HAS THE MOST VALUABLE HAIR?

08:56.577 --> 08:58.913
- PUT THOSE AWAY.
ARE YOU INSANE?

08:58.996 --> 09:01.290
- BUT I NEED A LOCK
OF CELEBRITY HAIR

09:01.374 --> 09:03.459
TO AUCTION OFF
FOR MY ANIMAL SHELTER.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.044

AND NOW YOU DON'T WANT ME?

18:27.105 --> 18:29.858
- WE BOTH KNOW
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.860
- WOW.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.197
SO THIS IS REALLY IT
FOR US?

18:35.280 --> 18:37.241
- I GUESS SO.

18:37.324 --> 18:42.037
BUT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
IN MY SPANK BANK.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.205
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT IS?

18:43.288 --> 18:45.415
- NO.

18:45.499 --> 18:48.669
- GOOD.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.420
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA WRITE
A SONG ABOUT YOU.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.714
COURSE, I WON'T BE ABLE
TO PLAY IT IN CONCERT

18:52.798 --> 18:55.092
'CAUSE THE FANS JUST WANT
TO HEAR ALL THE OLD STUFF.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.010
- [chuckles]

18:57.094 --> 18:59.471
GOOD-BYE, JOHNNY.

19:13.819 --> 19:14.736
- WHAT WAS I THINKING?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.113
NATALYA'S NOT BETTER
FOR ME.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.865
SHE'S 22.

19:17.948 --> 19:20.617
SHE NEVER EVEN DIALED
A PHONE.

19:20.701 --> 19:23.912
- WHAT WAS I THINKING,
DOING SOMETHING UNSELFISH?

19:23.996 --> 19:26.540
- [chuckles]
YEAH.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.876
THAT'S NOT THE WOMAN
I LOVE.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.460
HAVING YOU 20% OF THE TIME

19:30.544 --> 19:32.129
IS BETTER THAN HAVING
ANY OTHER WOMAN

19:32.212 --> 19:33.213
ALL OF THE TIME.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.424
- AWW.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.134
ACTUALLY,
WHEN YOU ADD UP THE DAYS,

19:37.217 --> 19:40.137
IT'S--IT'S REALLY NOT
EVEN 20%, JUST...

19:40.220 --> 19:43.473
- OH, SHUT UP.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.100
- THIS IS...
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

19:45.183 --> 19:47.436
VISELNUB'S BACK WITH JOHNNY.

19:47.519 --> 19:50.814
- THERE ARE PLENTY OF FISH
IN THE SEA.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.275
ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEBODY
FAMOUS LIKE YOU.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.485
YOU ARE FAMOUS, AREN'T YOU?

19:55.569 --> 19:57.571
- YES, VERY.

19:57.654 --> 19:59.656
BUT IT STILL HURTS.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.617
- OH, OF COURSE IT DOES.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.660
COME HERE.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.454
OH.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.872
[sighs deeply]

20:12.377 --> 20:14.004
[snip]
