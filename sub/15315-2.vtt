00:13.624 --> 00:15.440
My name is Robin Hood

00:15.641 --> 00:17.800
and this is an ambush!

00:18.165 --> 00:20.120
<i>While there's people going hungry,</i>

00:20.667 --> 00:22.360
While there's injustice
in this land,

00:22.713 --> 00:26.360
<i>Me and my men will fight for what's
right, and we take from the rich...</i>

00:26.629 --> 00:28.120
... to give to the poor.

00:28.424 --> 00:29.874
For a fairer world.

00:30.401 --> 00:34.101
Now you took that money off people
who can ill-afford it. So...

00:34.812 --> 00:36.388
we'll take it back!

00:40.819 --> 00:42.160
You're outnumbered.

00:44.448 --> 00:47.336
- And what makes you think that?
- Take cover!

00:55.459 --> 00:59.040
Now... you're outnumbered,
you're out-armed,

01:00.031 --> 01:01.481
so get out of here.

01:02.309 --> 01:03.760
Go on, run!

01:03.961 --> 01:04.961
Go! Go!

01:14.915 --> 01:15.920
We're back!

Episode Two: CAUSE AND EFFECT

02:00.144 --> 02:03.927
<i>I want the men ready
for transportation immediately!</i>

02:04.680 --> 02:07.630
<i>Too old. He'll be meeting
his maker soon enough.</i>

02:07.906 --> 02:10.020
<i>Able-bodied men only!</i>

02:15.789 --> 02:17.743
They're making prisoners of them.

02:17.863 --> 02:18.863
Or slaves.

02:22.915 --> 02:23.979
Gisborne.

02:29.396 --> 02:33.317
Kate, stop, they'll search the cart.
I'll lose you and your brother.

02:33.437 --> 02:36.760
You see what they're doing? If we don't
move him now he'll be caught.

02:37.496 --> 02:38.680
Just stay inside.

02:39.452 --> 02:41.402
I'll get Matthew out of here.

02:58.331 --> 03:00.195
Here's bread, a few leftovers
and a knife.

03:00.315 --> 03:02.720
- I don't like leaving you like this.
- Find us somewhere better

03:02.840 --> 03:05.006
Yes. I'll send for you all.

03:05.520 --> 03:06.480
In a hurry?

03:08.436 --> 03:11.760
Delivery for the market
in Nottingham. I'm late.

03:13.497 --> 03:14.497
Search.

03:17.159 --> 03:19.760
No, there's nothing in there,
there's nothing in there!

03:27.161 --> 03:28.880
These people have taken enough.

03:29.041 --> 03:32.074
One day they'll rise up and destroy you
and all men like you.

03:32.194 --> 03:33.590
Dangerous talk.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.800
We'll soon beat that out of you.

03:36.081 --> 03:38.440
- Take him away.
- Please, my brother, he's so young...

03:38.601 --> 03:40.920
You tried to defy me!

03:41.630 --> 03:42.640
Flog her!

03:43.054 --> 03:44.054
Matthew!

03:48.360 --> 03:51.120
Right. You better get used
to taking orders.

03:51.540 --> 03:53.785
You're going to be soldiers,
all of you.

03:53.905 --> 03:56.005
So say goodbye to your families.

03:56.233 --> 03:57.983
Bring them to the castle.

04:24.441 --> 04:25.800
You're Robin Hood.

04:26.350 --> 04:29.050
And you, young lady,
are lucky to be alive!

04:30.040 --> 04:31.600
Now You need to tell me what happened.

04:31.873 --> 04:34.360
I heard Gisborne say they were
taking the men to be soldiers.

04:34.521 --> 04:37.760
Why does the Sheriff suddenly
need another army?

04:41.062 --> 04:43.720
- Who's that
- Some girl we just saved.

04:44.252 --> 04:45.560
My name is Kate.

04:46.678 --> 04:49.440
We'll get your brother back, Kate.
I promise.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.760
We all thought
you were gone forever.

04:52.999 --> 04:55.360
My little sister thinks
Robin Hood's just a story.

04:55.521 --> 04:59.367
Stories are important. Stronger
than truth. Heroes inspire us.

04:59.721 --> 05:02.197
- Tuck always talks like that.
- Just nod and smile.

05:02.317 --> 05:04.360
Come on, we head them off
at the hollow.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.120
I'm... Much by the way.

05:11.547 --> 05:14.953
And don't worry, I'll make sure
you're looked after.

05:15.073 --> 05:18.929
I mean, we'll make sure
you're looked after.

05:19.404 --> 05:21.204
I can take care of myself.

05:22.172 --> 05:25.880
- What are you doing?
- Shut up Allan, just shut up.

05:31.764 --> 05:33.840
Get up MacMurrough,
you lazy Irish dog!

05:34.861 --> 05:36.211
The party's over.

05:39.361 --> 05:41.811
Gisborne, I was
very comfortable here.

05:43.340 --> 05:45.120
Very comfortable indeed.

05:45.493 --> 05:47.746
The rest of your men
are on their way.

05:47.866 --> 05:50.131
I said, get up!

05:54.645 --> 05:57.480
You know, big fella, you've been
riling me since I got here.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.925
What say we... settle it,
sporting fashion?

06:03.825 --> 06:04.975
First strike.

06:06.710 --> 06:09.210
Blunt edge of the blade only,
of course.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.633
For the cause!

06:19.842 --> 06:23.612
Ireland for the Irish
under an Irish king.

06:24.199 --> 06:27.699
- The devil with your English rule.
- My mother was French.

06:33.920 --> 06:37.160
You know, I hope the soldiers you've promised me
are better fighters than you are.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.080
They're expensive enough.

06:50.447 --> 06:52.047
First strike, I think.

06:53.352 --> 06:55.152
Sure, you're already dead.

06:56.905 --> 06:59.720
So, Gisborne's met his match!

07:00.376 --> 07:03.137
I like your style, MacMurrough,
very sneaky.

07:03.584 --> 07:04.760
How's your head?

07:05.373 --> 07:09.123
Like a hundred blacksmiths have
played the anvil behind me eyes.

07:09.358 --> 07:10.600
What a night!

07:11.029 --> 07:14.160
Indeed. Make yourself
comfortable... Gisborne.

07:21.498 --> 07:23.048
<i>Come on, keep moving.</i>

07:24.071 --> 07:25.080
<i>Keep in line.</i>

07:27.000 --> 07:28.300
<i>Keep moving now.</i>

07:39.673 --> 07:41.980
- We take them now, right?
- No, wait for his signal.

07:42.100 --> 07:44.760
- She's right, now's our chance.
- Don't mistake rashness for loyalty.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.221
- Wait.
- Robin!

07:47.193 --> 07:49.000
- What's the matter?
- Trouble.

07:50.589 --> 07:52.069
- Come here!
- Kate!Stop!

07:52.189 --> 07:53.480
Where's she going?

07:53.828 --> 07:54.828
<i>Kate!</i>

08:10.635 --> 08:12.280
- Are you all right?
- Come on, Tuck.

08:12.572 --> 08:14.400
Kate, you've put us all at risk here.

08:14.561 --> 08:16.121
I had to save my brother.
- Nearly there.

08:16.241 --> 08:19.796
- Kate, you shouldn't have comeit's too dangerous.
- I brought help, Robin Hood.

08:22.641 --> 08:23.680
Now!

08:23.920 --> 08:24.920
MacMurrough!

08:25.080 --> 08:26.080
Trouble!

08:30.286 --> 08:32.563
- Follow my men into the forest!
- I'm right behind you.

08:32.683 --> 08:34.102
Into the forest!

08:34.919 --> 08:36.477
Matthew! Matthew!

08:42.995 --> 08:44.039
You men,

08:44.961 --> 08:46.440
you belong to me now!

08:47.353 --> 08:49.080
You fight well for my cause

08:49.929 --> 08:52.920
and some of you may live
to see your homes again.

08:53.278 --> 08:55.610
You cross me and you're dead.

08:57.140 --> 08:59.637
It's a good job we came out
to meet them lads.

08:59.757 --> 09:03.717
The Sheriff's men weren't exactly
protecting my... investment.

09:04.271 --> 09:05.765
Fine work, all of you.

09:05.885 --> 09:07.650
Now, move them out!

09:08.081 --> 09:09.081
Here.

09:09.414 --> 09:12.174
Take this so they won't
recognise you.

09:12.486 --> 09:13.486
Thanks.

09:16.373 --> 09:17.819
Thanks to you, they've got Robin!

09:17.939 --> 09:20.955
Did you really think you could save
your brother on your own?

09:21.075 --> 09:24.149
Look, It was my fault as well, all right?
I went in too quick...

09:24.269 --> 09:28.040
So who were the painted faces?
They came out of nowhere.

09:28.320 --> 09:31.520
Celts. Warriors. A battle technique
based on surprise and brute force.

09:31.640 --> 09:34.548
If they're working with the Sheriff,
we need a water-tight plan.

09:34.668 --> 09:37.018
Hold on, Tuck!
Who put you in charge?

09:38.400 --> 09:41.360
- Somebody has to lead in Robin's absence.
- I don't see why it should be you...

09:41.520 --> 09:44.360
- What, You think it should be you after... your display earlier?
- Stop.

09:44.941 --> 09:47.026
Where's the girl?

09:49.907 --> 09:53.120
Let's find her before she puts
herself and Robin in danger.

09:53.530 --> 09:56.814
Whoever it was who attacked your troops
knew what they were doing.

09:56.934 --> 09:59.638
Nearly succeeded in freeing
my conscripts.

10:00.420 --> 10:03.552
Robin Hood, a bothersome little fly.

10:05.526 --> 10:08.226
You brushed him aside,
well done, very good.

10:09.611 --> 10:11.200
Where's my money?

10:11.575 --> 10:13.690
Well, at least the men
got their work-out.

10:13.810 --> 10:15.800
Saves me taking sword drill today.

10:15.961 --> 10:18.361
Well, that's your job,
little brother!

10:18.608 --> 10:21.880
The men look to you for leadership.
All you do is drink and play.

10:22.717 --> 10:23.967
Yes, yes, well.

10:24.900 --> 10:27.480
Got to keep them
hungry for the cause.

10:28.004 --> 10:30.600
To the next King of Ireland,
my brother.

10:32.008 --> 10:34.408
You don't take
the cause lightly, boy!

10:34.720 --> 10:37.210
- Gentlemen...
- It's a sacred trust.

10:37.522 --> 10:38.606
Gentlemen?

10:39.175 --> 10:40.625
Time and a place...

10:44.015 --> 10:45.040
Money.

10:46.127 --> 10:47.743
You have your soldiers.

10:47.863 --> 10:50.534
You're playing a dangerous game,
aren't you, Sheriff.

10:50.654 --> 10:53.800
Supplying the enemies
of Prince John with troops.

11:00.265 --> 11:03.880
I know all about you two...
You have no allies.

11:04.787 --> 11:08.781
And this is your last chance to grab
power in Ireland and you both know it.

11:09.167 --> 11:10.167
So...

11:10.720 --> 11:12.720
do we seal the deal, or don't we?

11:13.142 --> 11:16.898
We'll exchange money for men
once we're safely on the coast, as planned.

11:17.264 --> 11:18.314
Not before.

11:22.900 --> 11:26.190
I want those two buffoons out
before anyone knows they're here.

11:26.310 --> 11:30.139
Afraid Prince John will find out you're
supplying soldiers to his enemies?

11:30.259 --> 11:31.259
Why...

11:32.102 --> 11:33.552
should he find out?

11:34.638 --> 11:37.216
Prince John will get
his patronage money, he has to.

11:37.336 --> 11:39.400
And where it comes from
is of no importance.

11:40.087 --> 11:42.037
Is that meant to frighten me?

11:42.567 --> 11:45.240
Look at you.
Your plans are in ruins.

11:45.818 --> 11:47.250
The Black Knights are disbanded.

11:47.370 --> 11:51.347
You're having to buy the affections of
a Prince that would rather see you dead.

11:51.581 --> 11:53.400
Why should I fear you?

11:54.314 --> 11:55.385
Because...

11:57.881 --> 12:00.320
... I AM THE SHERIFF OF NOTTINGHAM!

12:02.652 --> 12:06.400
- You should've escaped while you could had the chance.
- I get away... we all get away.

12:06.561 --> 12:09.080
They're men here from every village
within 30 miles.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.990
You'll never save us all.

12:12.488 --> 12:14.188
Well, I still have this.

12:14.752 --> 12:16.040
Come here...

12:18.048 --> 12:19.048
Right,

12:19.571 --> 12:21.600
some of you men
from Locksley know me.

12:21.761 --> 12:23.811
The rest of you know what I do.

12:24.385 --> 12:28.333
Now we have one chance to do this
and we have to be ready to take it.

12:28.453 --> 12:31.080
For your villages
and for your families.

12:31.241 --> 12:33.840
- Will you stand with me and fight?
- Yes.

12:38.609 --> 12:39.759
<i>There she is.</i>

12:46.881 --> 12:48.920
<i>She's trying to get in
with the servants.</i>

12:54.263 --> 12:56.897
<i>She's done it! Amazing.</i>

12:57.162 --> 12:58.789
<i> There's too many guards.</i>

12:58.909 --> 13:00.959
So we lay a trap in the forest.

13:02.288 --> 13:04.799
To get to the coast, road  they'll take
the prisoners through the ravine.

13:04.919 --> 13:06.919
That's our best chance to attack.

13:07.039 --> 13:09.480
- I'm not leaving Robin.
- Or Kate.

13:09.769 --> 13:10.632
Or her.

13:10.752 --> 13:14.090
Stay if you want to, Much, but don't expect us
to come back and rescue you.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.210
Come on.

13:15.777 --> 13:17.391
Go on. Go!

13:25.880 --> 13:26.760
You!

13:27.358 --> 13:29.337
Seize her! Come here!

13:33.200 --> 13:36.917
- You're becoming a bit of nuisance.
- Do what you want to me.

13:37.037 --> 13:39.087
- I'm not scared of you.
- Really.

13:39.207 --> 13:41.520
But what about that precious
brother of yours?

13:42.495 --> 13:44.000
Find her brother and hang him.

13:44.976 --> 13:46.836
- You can't do that.
- I just did.

13:46.956 --> 13:50.120
- And make sure she sees him die.
- Please, he's done nothing wrong.

13:51.284 --> 13:54.384
The men you brought in,
I know something about them.

13:57.567 --> 13:59.709
They weren't just villagers.

14:04.162 --> 14:05.162
Talk.

14:06.832 --> 14:09.609
- You won't hurt my brother?
- I don't think You're not in a position to bargain.

14:09.729 --> 14:10.880
What about the men?

14:13.168 --> 14:14.518
One of them is...

14:15.676 --> 14:16.880
is Robin Hood.

14:19.041 --> 14:21.880
The front line with me,
hold off the guards.

14:22.233 --> 14:24.328
The second line attack the gates.

14:24.448 --> 14:27.487
Use the chains, anything
you can find as weapons.

14:27.607 --> 14:29.057
Wait for my signal.

14:32.976 --> 14:36.390
- They don't look like much.
- Well, I'm giving them to you, Tiernan.

14:36.561 --> 14:38.680
They're yours to train and lead.

14:39.151 --> 14:41.702
You expect me to make soldiers
out of peasants?

14:41.822 --> 14:42.822
No.

14:44.009 --> 14:46.360
Sergeant! Extra guards, now!

14:47.254 --> 14:48.280
Robin Hood!

14:48.441 --> 14:50.193
Ready? Hold.

14:51.071 --> 14:52.075
Now!

14:58.936 --> 15:02.624
No weapons and yet they fight
like lions for that man.

15:03.201 --> 15:04.640
Secure the gates!

15:08.598 --> 15:09.400
Hood!

15:09.561 --> 15:10.920
Wait, wait. Stop!

15:13.668 --> 15:15.930
- Another move and I kill the girl.
- Kate!

15:16.374 --> 15:17.400
Wait!

15:18.282 --> 15:19.652
No, Matthew!

15:19.977 --> 15:21.021
Matthew, no!

15:23.732 --> 15:26.186
Are you all right? Let me help you.

15:29.167 --> 15:31.485
You're surrounded.
Don't waste any more lives.

15:31.605 --> 15:34.794
- I'm here Matthew, Matthew...
- Kate.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.904
I'm here... I'm here,
Matthew... I'm here.

15:38.995 --> 15:40.760
I'll do anything, I'll doanything you say.

15:41.137 --> 15:43.175
Please, please help him...

15:44.772 --> 15:46.068
Lie still, lie still.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.405
I'm going to get you home,
you're going to be all right.

15:48.525 --> 15:50.280
Everything is going to be all right.

15:50.933 --> 15:52.478
Find a better place,

15:52.994 --> 15:54.960
and take care of our family.

15:57.079 --> 15:58.360
It's up to you now...

16:07.397 --> 16:09.593
Matthew? Matthew? No...

16:10.801 --> 16:12.360
You'll pay for this, Gisborne.

16:13.666 --> 16:15.720
Get the girl out of the castle.

16:17.984 --> 16:18.984
Come on!

16:19.245 --> 16:20.709
No, no, no...

16:24.561 --> 16:26.760
- Say your prayers, outlaw.
- Gisborne!

16:27.761 --> 16:29.760
You move, Gisborne, and you die.

16:30.382 --> 16:32.050
I will have his blood!

16:32.401 --> 16:35.120
- Don't be so selfish.
- Get off me, he dies now!

16:35.544 --> 16:36.594
Come, come,

16:37.449 --> 16:41.801
surely you don't want to miss the SLOW
and painful death of Robin Hood?

16:54.109 --> 16:55.126
Up, up.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.880
Kate, it's me.

17:03.886 --> 17:05.445
What happened?

17:12.161 --> 17:14.060
We call this room the Vault.

17:15.239 --> 17:16.239
One door,

17:16.988 --> 17:20.282
solid oak, three locks,
no windows, just...

17:21.721 --> 17:23.958
- lots of stone.
- A challenge.

17:24.567 --> 17:27.079
It's the last room you'll ever know.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.511
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

17:31.775 --> 17:33.520
I'm gonna make you suffer
before you die.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.990
Just like you're suffering,
Gisborne?

17:37.188 --> 17:41.133
You know you could kill me 100 times
over, but the pain you're feeling now,

17:41.525 --> 17:43.475
the hatred, the self-loathing

17:44.088 --> 17:45.888
is never going to go away.

17:51.240 --> 17:54.157
You'll never hate me
as much as you hate yourself!

17:54.277 --> 17:55.510
Put it away!

17:57.183 --> 17:59.014
Always in such a rush?

18:00.423 --> 18:03.873
Sometimes I think you don't appreciate
the poetry of pain.

18:04.867 --> 18:08.176
Something clearly Robin Hood does.

18:10.660 --> 18:11.660
So,

18:11.975 --> 18:15.880
how about the death of a thousand cuts,
a nasty Saracen invention.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.240
As long as he dies.

18:28.864 --> 18:30.320
A visitor.

18:30.746 --> 18:33.480
I won't shake your hand
if you don't mind.

18:33.822 --> 18:36.330
They tell me you were once
a nobleman.

18:37.493 --> 18:41.127
That you gave up your title,
lost your lands, lost all your wealth...

18:41.400 --> 18:43.543
The people have endured far worse.

18:43.663 --> 18:46.647
They told me that you lost
the woman you loved.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.521
What do you want from me, Irishman?

18:53.443 --> 18:55.280
We're the same, you and me.

18:55.927 --> 18:57.799
We both have a cause.

18:58.434 --> 18:59.708
But you, Robin,

19:00.361 --> 19:03.622
you inspire men.
I've seen it. Right here.

19:04.694 --> 19:05.694
You see,

19:06.321 --> 19:08.463
my people, well...

19:09.511 --> 19:12.600
my people are as oppressed
by this Prince John as your people.

19:12.720 --> 19:16.575
And yet... they will not rise
at the call of Finn MacMurrough.

19:17.251 --> 19:18.670
And you want my help?

19:18.880 --> 19:21.080
I want you to join forces with me.

19:21.843 --> 19:23.800
We can learn from each other,
you and me.

19:24.804 --> 19:28.093
Together we can smash
this Prince John, the Sheriff,

19:28.573 --> 19:29.673
all of them.

19:30.241 --> 19:34.131
I'll help you free England,
you help me free Ireland.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.306
We can both be Kings!

19:36.491 --> 19:38.903
Now, what do you say to that?

19:42.742 --> 19:44.560
England already has a king.

19:49.143 --> 19:51.909
Richard. His name is Richard.

19:53.075 --> 19:54.760
I only have to shout.

19:54.880 --> 19:57.120
There's half a battalion out there.

20:03.625 --> 20:06.025
You think over
what I've said to you.

20:06.287 --> 20:08.608
Perhaps you don't want a crown,
but...

20:08.728 --> 20:12.093
a just and fair country,
if that's what you want.

20:16.540 --> 20:19.140
I might be the only chance
you have left.

20:31.415 --> 20:33.600
Thank you very much.

20:35.120 --> 20:38.035
So they tried to fight their way out
and that's when her brother was killed.

20:38.155 --> 20:40.989
And then all hell broke loose.
Gisborne found out Robin was

20:41.109 --> 20:43.760
with them and now he's in the castle,
heavily guarded.

20:43.880 --> 20:46.048
Right. We go to Nottingham.

20:47.815 --> 20:48.939
We'll be back.

20:49.059 --> 20:51.370
What about the village men?
They're shipping them out to Ireland today!

20:51.490 --> 20:53.090
Robin is our priority.

20:53.855 --> 20:57.855
Losing an entire generation of men will
kill all the villages for miles around.

20:59.034 --> 21:01.556
- You put one man before stopping that?
- Kate,

21:02.517 --> 21:04.553
villages are dying across England.

21:04.673 --> 21:07.860
The only thing the people have
is a spark of hope called Robin Hood.

21:07.980 --> 21:09.938
He's more important
than any one man.

21:10.058 --> 21:12.920
He's an idea. Something that people
can believe in.

21:14.241 --> 21:16.391
I gave up Robin Hood to Gisborne.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.974
You what? You didn't say that.

21:21.818 --> 21:23.068
I'd do it again

21:23.567 --> 21:25.040
to save my little brother.

21:26.364 --> 21:29.640
He wasn't important enough.
He was just a village man

21:29.760 --> 21:32.880
who wanted to raise a family
and live an honest life.

21:33.329 --> 21:35.029
Well, I believed in him.

21:36.832 --> 21:38.032
Now he's dead.

21:40.199 --> 21:43.439
And you think...
that the idea of Robin Hood

21:43.887 --> 21:45.987
is more important than his life?

21:48.328 --> 21:49.678
You make me sick.

22:29.811 --> 22:31.120
Hello, little fella?

22:33.939 --> 22:35.534
Where did you come from?

22:42.434 --> 22:45.560
I might just have found
my way out of here...

22:58.045 --> 23:00.205
Just run that by me again,
we're going to do what?

23:00.325 --> 23:02.880
We're going to break
Robin Hood out of here.

23:04.296 --> 23:06.857
It must be all this English air,
you're not thinking straight.

23:06.977 --> 23:10.341
Tiernan, for once in your life
would you stop looking for an easy ride

23:10.461 --> 23:13.261
and recognise what's
staring you in the face!

23:14.412 --> 23:17.000
Robin Hood's no ordinary outlaw.

23:17.239 --> 23:20.040
He's one of us.
Fighting a tyrant - the Sheriff.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.138
You told me to do the deal.

23:22.936 --> 23:26.880
- We had nowhere else to go.
- Now we do. Robin Hood.

23:27.664 --> 23:31.664
Look, with a man like that alongside us,
our Irish people will rise.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.160
They'll fight. I'm sure of it.

23:36.383 --> 23:40.040
You've lost the fire, baby brother.
If you ever really had it.

23:44.643 --> 23:45.886
Are you with me?

23:53.768 --> 23:54.768
Tiernan!

24:13.361 --> 24:15.809
I'd never have fitted
through there anyway.

24:17.198 --> 24:19.417
Come on Robin, come on, think.

24:43.381 --> 24:45.040
Please God, come on.

24:49.750 --> 24:50.750
Ready?

24:51.901 --> 24:53.022
Here we go...

25:04.458 --> 25:06.389
Yes, you little dancer!

25:16.656 --> 25:17.656
Fire!

25:18.936 --> 25:20.169
Fetch water!

25:20.644 --> 25:21.644
Fire!

25:22.034 --> 25:24.200
You, get the prisoner out of there.

25:24.361 --> 25:25.361
Open up!

25:26.158 --> 25:28.921
No, no, no, no, no.

25:31.675 --> 25:35.219
I'm afraid your privileges in my castle
are cancelled, my friend.

25:36.005 --> 25:37.438
An old trick...

25:38.077 --> 25:39.476
but a very good one.

25:41.575 --> 25:43.766
- Tiernan?
- Sorry brother.

25:44.706 --> 25:47.088
The Sheriff here made me realise
the problem

25:47.208 --> 25:48.680
is not with our cause.

25:48.800 --> 25:51.160
No, though a very worthy endeavour.

25:51.635 --> 25:54.440
- It's with the man who's leading it.
- You fool.

25:55.065 --> 25:56.914
I found a real ally right here.

25:57.644 --> 26:00.857
Yes, in exchange
for a few small trifles,

26:02.072 --> 26:03.130
County...

26:03.527 --> 26:05.000
Galway I believe.

26:05.323 --> 26:08.456
You haven't the sense to lead an army,
let alone a nation.

26:09.451 --> 26:10.468
Says you.

26:13.180 --> 26:15.099
But the men are with me.

26:17.272 --> 26:19.395
Didn't take much persuasion mind,
but then again

26:19.515 --> 26:23.415
all you offered them was a glorious
death in the name of the cause!

26:30.824 --> 26:32.097
When I'm King...

26:33.226 --> 26:34.920
they will be well rewarded.

26:36.215 --> 26:39.422
You're going to leave me here?!
Tiernan!

26:40.334 --> 26:42.800
I'm your brother! I'm your king!

26:42.961 --> 26:45.734
Chain him up
and throw him in there with Hood.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.760
- They can die together.
- Tiernan?

26:53.298 --> 26:56.755
Tiernan, you come back here
and face me, boy!

26:57.355 --> 26:58.950
Save your breath.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.219
My selfish greedy little brother.

27:08.365 --> 27:10.701
By the time he's bored
of this new game,

27:10.821 --> 27:14.080
he'll have ruined our last chance
to free Ireland.

27:16.164 --> 27:18.240
We should never have come here.

27:18.481 --> 27:20.762
Our cause belongs to our people.

27:20.984 --> 27:24.984
Yours, yours have trouble
enough with this poisonous Sheriff.

27:26.914 --> 27:28.798
Perhaps we can be allies.

27:32.197 --> 27:33.364
How did you?

27:34.325 --> 27:35.570
You helped me,

27:36.865 --> 27:38.360
now I'll help you.

27:51.672 --> 27:52.672
Kate,

27:53.501 --> 27:55.672
Kate, I've been so worried.

27:59.468 --> 28:00.480
Matthew.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.293
I'm so sorry.

28:10.076 --> 28:11.680
Robin Hood tried to save him.

28:11.800 --> 28:15.440
I hope Robin Hood gets hanged
from the highest gallows in Nottingham.

28:15.838 --> 28:19.400
- It won't bring Matthew back though.
- Robin Hood is an outlaw.

28:19.548 --> 28:22.994
He just brings trouble.
They'll be back now, the Sheriff's men.

28:23.114 --> 28:25.240
Back to make examples
of the rest of us.

28:25.360 --> 28:28.207
That doesn't mean we
should sit here and take it.

28:29.447 --> 28:31.400
That kind of talk is dangerous.

28:31.633 --> 28:34.049
That's what's got
your brother killed!

28:35.410 --> 28:36.983
<i>Come on, keep moving...</i>

28:37.465 --> 28:39.211
What a glorious day

28:40.485 --> 28:42.462
for an execution.

28:44.034 --> 28:46.022
It's a long march,
we need to leave now.

28:46.142 --> 28:49.934
Yes, but surely we shall stay
to see the executions.

28:50.627 --> 28:51.627
No.

28:52.450 --> 28:54.843
But it's Robin Hood and Finn.

28:55.222 --> 28:56.222
Sheriff,

28:57.733 --> 28:59.520
I will not watch my brother die.

29:00.514 --> 29:02.480
We leave now or the deal is off.

29:05.747 --> 29:06.880
Very well.

29:08.178 --> 29:09.472
This is my fault.

29:11.883 --> 29:14.160
Matthew died
trying to save me from Gisborne.

29:14.841 --> 29:15.841
What?

29:19.431 --> 29:21.373
I went after Matthew alone,

29:22.352 --> 29:23.693
without thinking.

29:26.238 --> 29:29.080
I got Matthew killed.
If I hadn't been so stupid...

29:29.308 --> 29:32.531
No. Robin Hood killed your brother
with his talk of

29:32.651 --> 29:34.560
fighting for a better future.

29:35.901 --> 29:37.080
You're wrong.

29:39.771 --> 29:43.771
These people believe in him.
And Matthew believed in him.

29:46.912 --> 29:49.358
- That's good enough reason to help.
- Where are you going?

29:49.478 --> 29:51.771
Kate, Robin Hood's a criminal.

29:52.496 --> 29:55.346
Kate, please,
you'll end up like your brother.

29:58.072 --> 30:00.360
I'm not doing this for Robin Hood.

30:00.774 --> 30:02.474
I'm doing it for Matthew.

30:07.284 --> 30:08.560
I want to see Hood die.

30:10.316 --> 30:12.200
Have I not made myself clear?

30:12.441 --> 30:14.720
No money
till the conscripts are at the coast.

30:14.881 --> 30:18.000
- Patronage first. Hood later.
- I will have my way.

30:19.240 --> 30:21.610
I'll watch him die and
bring his head to you on the road

30:21.730 --> 30:24.522
and you can send it
with the money to Prince John.

30:28.324 --> 30:32.318
Yes.
Very good, Prince John would like that.

30:32.966 --> 30:35.716
He can show off his head
in his trophy room.

30:36.730 --> 30:38.371
I may allow you to have your way

30:38.491 --> 30:41.141
but you can even think
of defying me again

30:41.624 --> 30:43.960
then it'll be your head
on its way to London.

30:49.640 --> 30:50.680
Move out!

31:05.615 --> 31:08.084
- Mice!
- Finn, leave him be!

31:08.616 --> 31:11.400
- I hate mice.
- Help me shift this, come on.

31:13.253 --> 31:16.840
- It looks pretty solid to me.
- Well, let's find out, shall we?

31:19.666 --> 31:21.373
I can feel a draft.

31:22.074 --> 31:23.079
Come on.

31:31.204 --> 31:32.975
The east gate's impossible.

31:33.525 --> 31:35.760
- Too many guards.
- Same to the west.

31:36.919 --> 31:38.600
- Storm the battlements?
- What?

31:39.010 --> 31:40.177
I'm joking.

31:40.453 --> 31:41.463
Joking.

31:51.094 --> 31:53.742
I know it's my fault
Robin Hood was captured.

31:55.068 --> 31:59.068
So I want to help you save
the village men, this once.

32:01.001 --> 32:03.851
I don't want Matthew
to have died for nothing.

32:04.601 --> 32:07.104
Well, apparently you're the leader,
Tuck.

32:07.961 --> 32:09.214
If it was me,

32:09.929 --> 32:11.929
I reckon she's a good fighter.

32:12.421 --> 32:14.971
And she's got in the castle
once before.

32:19.132 --> 32:20.788
You take orders from me.

32:20.908 --> 32:23.140
Go in alone and we leave you behind.

32:31.251 --> 32:34.080
Make sure the executioner
is prepared and have horses ready.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.760
We join the Sheriff
immediately Robin Hood is dead.

32:44.373 --> 32:47.481
Drainage gutter.
That's our way out.

32:47.601 --> 32:50.545
We're going to get out through here?
It's not possible!

32:57.256 --> 32:58.505
Open the door.

33:28.518 --> 33:29.635
Come on...

33:30.295 --> 33:31.308
COME ON!

33:40.250 --> 33:42.320
They've escaped! You, wait there!

33:42.481 --> 33:45.621
The rest of you search the castle.
Find them!

33:48.637 --> 33:51.863
Finn, I think this might be
our way out.

34:07.631 --> 34:09.040
- Finn?
- What?

34:09.610 --> 34:11.252
We have a problem.

34:19.359 --> 34:20.880
- Get me that chain.
- Why?

34:21.041 --> 34:22.885
Just give me the chain!

34:35.442 --> 34:36.656
Grab my feet.

35:33.996 --> 35:35.337
- Robin!
<i>- Much!</i>

35:39.945 --> 35:41.443
There! Get them!

36:01.587 --> 36:02.616
With me.

36:03.422 --> 36:04.422
Hold this.

36:06.904 --> 36:09.280
- Are you sure about this?
- I hope so.

36:13.882 --> 36:14.882
Ready?

36:15.439 --> 36:16.439
Now!

36:21.345 --> 36:22.360
Hood!!!

36:23.503 --> 36:24.532
Hood!!!

36:27.832 --> 36:30.167
Hey Robin, we're flying!

36:47.914 --> 36:49.200
John, grab the sides!

36:54.055 --> 36:57.520
- Where's the men from the village?
- On the road. We have horses.

36:57.761 --> 37:00.000
- You came back?
- To save the village men.

37:00.160 --> 37:03.960
- If that means helping you first...
- I'm glad you did. Come on!

37:12.361 --> 37:15.480
Hood and Finn have escaped! They're
after you. I've more men on the way.

37:15.869 --> 37:17.571
You let my brother get out?

37:17.691 --> 37:19.960
He won't rest
until he's hunted me down!

37:20.609 --> 37:22.135
We're under attack!

37:24.994 --> 37:26.640
It's Hood! Take cover!

37:33.148 --> 37:35.748
Quickly, you two.
Get the money, come on.

37:37.336 --> 37:40.365
Where's he going with my money?
Get after him, Gisborne!

37:48.819 --> 37:52.680
They're everywhere!
Pull back, wait for reinforcements!

37:52.921 --> 37:53.921
Move!

37:54.898 --> 37:57.880
Much, Allan, keep the Sheriff
and Gisborne pinned down.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.450
The rest of us after Tiernan,
come on.

38:01.912 --> 38:03.746
Come on, come on, quick, go, go.

38:03.866 --> 38:05.681
Into the forest men, come on.

38:07.761 --> 38:09.080
Come on, hurry up!

38:13.213 --> 38:14.924
Sure, you're already dead.

38:17.460 --> 38:19.657
I'll take my leave of you,
Robin Hood.

38:21.371 --> 38:22.728
When I'm King

38:23.188 --> 38:24.198
of Ireland

38:24.960 --> 38:27.360
there'll always be room
at my court for you.

38:27.710 --> 38:30.633
That's all right.
We've got our own fight here.

38:32.092 --> 38:34.760
- What about your brother?
- He's no brother of mine.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.706
Not any more,

38:37.339 --> 38:39.143
but he'll get a fair trial.

38:39.791 --> 38:42.720
- Come on John, give the man his money!
- Ach sure,

38:43.566 --> 38:45.427
I don't really need it all.

38:47.438 --> 38:50.160
For your men and for their families.

38:51.956 --> 38:53.960
Plenty left to raise an army.

38:54.201 --> 38:56.429
A small group of
highly committed men

38:57.494 --> 38:59.894
is worth more
than an army of slaves.

39:00.245 --> 39:02.118
Well, good luck my friend.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.520
And spend the money wisely,

39:06.898 --> 39:07.898
we will.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.319
Ah. Prince John's escort.

39:25.862 --> 39:27.912
They want their money Gisborne.

39:28.119 --> 39:29.795
- So what do we do?
- We?

39:31.556 --> 39:33.960
Do you think that I'm going
to be responsible for your

39:34.080 --> 39:36.543
arrogance
and your incompetence again?

39:37.574 --> 39:39.440
You can't be serious? Put it down.

39:39.560 --> 39:42.785
No, Gisborne.
This time YOU pay my dues.

39:43.184 --> 39:44.560
Gentlemen, good to see you.

39:45.708 --> 39:48.360
Very smart, lovely colours,
tight fitting uniform, excellent.

39:48.480 --> 39:49.967
Slight change of plan,

39:50.087 --> 39:52.360
- there is no patronage money.
- What?

39:52.773 --> 39:54.200
But Gisborne has volunteered

39:54.361 --> 39:56.880
to go with you to explain
why not to Prince John. Personally.

39:57.371 --> 39:59.840
No, my Lord, please!
This means certain death.

40:00.001 --> 40:01.040
Get off me!

40:02.995 --> 40:06.856
Well, you never know. You might
catch Prince John in a good mood.

40:07.648 --> 40:09.000
He's all yours.

40:09.334 --> 40:11.120
I won't forget this.

40:11.519 --> 40:13.160
I'll be back for you.

40:14.482 --> 40:15.482
Get off!

40:16.415 --> 40:17.560
Get off me!

40:28.212 --> 40:31.370
One at a time gents.
All right? You'll all get some.

40:34.166 --> 40:35.166
Kate...

40:36.538 --> 40:37.538
Kate.

40:41.284 --> 40:43.134
I just wanted to thank you.

40:44.271 --> 40:46.142
And I'm so sorry for your brother.

40:46.262 --> 40:50.012
- If I could change anything...
- I said I'd help you this once.

40:50.334 --> 40:51.821
But my brother's dead

40:52.822 --> 40:56.240
and people will go on dying while you
give them false hopes of a better life.

40:56.404 --> 40:57.560
Kate, wait.

41:00.161 --> 41:02.374
I mean to make those hopes real.

41:03.632 --> 41:05.320
It's too late for Matthew.

41:08.337 --> 41:11.728
Well, I've paid my debt
for turning you in, for his sake.

41:15.080 --> 41:17.320
I don't ever want to see you again.

41:21.541 --> 41:22.801
Is that Kate?

41:24.492 --> 41:27.655
- Where's she going?
- She's going home to her family.

41:30.229 --> 41:31.629
I've let her down.

41:32.095 --> 41:34.440
You can't expect to
win over every mind,

41:34.853 --> 41:36.506
or a heart so full of sorrow.

41:36.626 --> 41:37.944
Let her grieve.

41:38.391 --> 41:41.680
That grief will turn to anger
and then she'll be ready to fight.

41:44.037 --> 41:47.200
Just as these men here
are ready to fight.

41:49.241 --> 41:52.560
This is the core of our army.
All they need is a leader.

42:01.227 --> 42:02.406
My friends...

42:04.822 --> 42:08.040
... lie low here until it's
safe to return to your villages.

42:08.497 --> 42:11.440
You're marked men.
But I swear to you,

42:11.601 --> 42:15.049
that brand you wear will
one day become a badge of honour.

42:16.388 --> 42:18.148
And believe me when I say

42:19.208 --> 42:21.851
that the day is coming when this Sheriff
will be held to account

42:21.971 --> 42:24.482
for what he's done to you
and your villages.

42:25.320 --> 42:26.735
And on that day

42:27.001 --> 42:29.320
my men and I will call on you.

42:30.025 --> 42:32.160
We will call on your strength.

42:32.863 --> 42:34.897
We will call on your courage.

42:35.826 --> 42:39.760
We will call on the love you bear
your families to stand with us and fight

42:40.786 --> 42:44.000
and overthrow the cruel
injustice that infects this land.

42:46.064 --> 42:48.260
- Are you with me?
- Yes!

42:58.287 --> 43:01.200
The Abbot has damned
our souls forever!

43:01.606 --> 43:04.720
We have to confront the Abbot right now!
We need to understand why he did this.

43:04.881 --> 43:08.160
There are things going on here
of such magnitude...

43:08.401 --> 43:11.440
... as to be beyond
your understanding.

43:11.681 --> 43:13.640
Heretics. Devils.
I trusted you.

43:14.778 --> 43:17.360
That is why Hood
must burn at the stake!

43:17.520 --> 43:18.542
Burn them!

43:18.662 --> 43:21.640
The choices we make at these
moments define us for eternity.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.150
I'm burning them!
