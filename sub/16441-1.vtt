<i>I read in the "Little Big Book of Birds"</i>

00:54.155 --> 00:57.269
<i>that ravens were once
the most colorful birds.</i>

00:58.105 --> 01:03.019
<i>But they were vain and mean
and never recognized their beauty.</i>

01:05.285 --> 01:08.815
<i>They were too busy
being unkind to each other</i>

01:08.965 --> 01:12.759
<i>so they were stripped of all
their colors and turned black.</i>

01:13.965 --> 01:15.832
<i>They are considered so evil</i>

01:15.982 --> 01:19.559
<i>that their favorite food is said
to be the flesh of a dead man.</i>

01:26.745 --> 01:30.539
<i>But ravens really like
to be together, like family.</i>

01:32.725 --> 01:35.239
<i>Let me introduce you to my ravens.</i>

02:50.485 --> 02:52.295
What's up, man?

02:52.445 --> 02:55.125
Look, it'll just be a couple of days.

02:57.225 --> 03:01.159
They're good people.
You got nothing to worry about, all right?

03:40.285 --> 03:43.075
- Come on, Mom, let's go.
- You know what? You go ahead.

03:43.225 --> 03:46.679
- I just want a minute alone, okay?
- Fine, grump.

03:47.525 --> 03:49.835
- Hello, ladies.
- Hi.

03:50.185 --> 03:52.904
- Hey, Provider-Dad. Can we go swimming?
- We'll go in a little bit.

03:53.054 --> 03:54.895
- Why?
- 'Cause I want to talk to your mom.

03:55.045 --> 03:56.644
- Promise?
- I promise.

03:56.794 --> 03:58.819
Okay. See you at the dock.

04:01.245 --> 04:03.695
- How was the flight?
- Not bad, a little bumpy.

04:03.845 --> 04:05.559
Yeah?

04:08.685 --> 04:12.219
- Glad you're here.
- Me too.

04:39.445 --> 04:43.265
Wendy, hey. Oh, my God.
Come here, group hug, group hug.

04:43.415 --> 04:47.565
- Here you go.
- Yeah? Nice.

04:48.165 --> 04:54.139
Oh, my God, this is Saturn.
She's my life partner for now.

04:55.405 --> 04:57.935
We had to put the finishing touches
on the art car for Burning Man,

04:58.085 --> 05:02.899
so we just worked all night, hopped
in the vangina and, boom, here we are.

05:03.945 --> 05:06.895
All right, well,
if you need anything, just ask.

05:07.045 --> 05:09.639
Yeah, I will.

05:10.165 --> 05:12.535
You're a Virgo, aren't you?

05:12.685 --> 05:16.108
- Triple.
- That is so sexy.

05:22.445 --> 05:27.139
- The truth is always beautiful.
- Mm-hm. Thanks, all right.

05:52.315 --> 05:55.409
There they are. Good times.

05:56.445 --> 05:58.379
Come here.

06:15.205 --> 06:16.455
- You blinked.
- No, I didn't.

06:16.605 --> 06:19.415
You did. Now go get your
victorious bio-dad a drink.

06:19.565 --> 06:23.735
Pink fever dry martini standing up
with a lemon twist... two olives?

06:24.410 --> 06:26.655
- Atta boy.
- Sounds good.

06:26.805 --> 06:29.205
Why don't you get your provider-Dad
one of those as well?

06:29.355 --> 06:33.375
Come here. Show Emma where
you keep the Chardonnay, okay?

06:34.125 --> 06:37.175
Let's grab a round of small ball
this weekend, yeah?

06:37.325 --> 06:42.135
- What's a small ball?
- Golf, darling. It's very, very dull.

06:42.285 --> 06:43.935
- Saul.
- Ellis.

06:44.085 --> 06:46.625
- Saul.
- Ellis.

06:47.525 --> 06:49.685
Here's your room.

06:50.762 --> 06:54.305
Oh, this is very nice.

06:54.905 --> 07:00.119
- We've never stayed on this floor before.
- Oh, really? I didn't realize that.

07:00.365 --> 07:04.405
Yeah, we stay in the room
by the kitchen, the maid's quarters.

07:05.657 --> 07:10.475
What? I'm not saying anything underneath
what I'm saying. I'm simply stating a fact.

07:10.625 --> 07:14.775
Well, Joey's really excited to see you.
All she can talk about is you.

07:14.925 --> 07:16.535
She's a smart kid.

07:16.685 --> 07:20.599
Try and spend some time with her.
It'll mean so much.

08:17.885 --> 08:20.810
You know, Jay's coming.
He's supposed to be here for dinner but...

08:20.960 --> 08:23.315
he's bringing a guest.
I guess he needed a ride.

08:23.465 --> 08:27.575
You know Jay. At least he has a new
girlfriend. He seems really happy.

08:32.414 --> 08:34.855
The drink always goes on the right side.

08:35.145 --> 08:39.469
This is the incorrect side
or the left side.

08:39.619 --> 08:43.399
- Put it on the right side.
- I think I'm going to make a toast.

08:45.265 --> 08:49.435
Ellis and I want to thank you so much for
coming to our home and celebrating with us.

08:49.585 --> 08:52.064
We really appreciate you making
the commitment every summer

08:52.214 --> 08:54.535
to come to our annual 4th of July party.

08:54.685 --> 08:57.375
Tradition is important
and you mean the world to us.

08:57.525 --> 09:02.135
So... cheers, to us and to years to come.

09:02.285 --> 09:04.388
- Years to come.
- Years to come.

09:04.538 --> 09:06.637
Cheers.

09:16.045 --> 09:18.515
- So how's work, big guy?
- It's fantastic.

09:18.665 --> 09:22.955
When everyone in Hollywood is bitching about
the recession, I haven't felt a goddamn thing.

09:23.105 --> 09:26.095
My new book hasn't even come out yet
and I've already sold the movie rights.

09:26.245 --> 09:27.385
Wow.

09:27.535 --> 09:30.565
Yes, not caving to commercialism
is a real feat for you, isn't it, darling?

09:30.715 --> 09:35.369
And you don't seem to be bothered
by the lifestyle its afforded you.

09:39.485 --> 09:43.495
- Honey, can you get some more wine?
- Yeah, sure.

09:43.645 --> 09:48.995
Joey... could you bring us a bottle
of the '63 Chateau Lafleur, please?

09:49.145 --> 09:52.215
We're out. We have the 2009 Twin Oaks.

09:52.365 --> 09:54.615
That's fine.
Why don't you bring us two of those?

09:54.765 --> 09:57.100
We have one.

09:57.250 --> 10:00.695
I was told I'd get everything I desire, and
you guys are dropping the ball on this one.

10:00.845 --> 10:05.375
Desire is everything.
When it fades, life ends.

10:05.525 --> 10:08.454
That's why I don't have sex.
Not like you guys do.

10:08.604 --> 10:12.135
I fuck only to elevate
to a higher spiritual plane.

10:12.285 --> 10:14.415
The mantra of Tantra.

10:14.565 --> 10:17.375
- Orgasm is a waste of energy.
- Hah!

10:17.525 --> 10:20.975
Anyway, Hal, let's hear... what have
you been up to in your crazy world?

10:21.125 --> 10:25.195
Well... got certified as a life coach.

10:25.345 --> 10:28.375
- Certified.
- What exactly is that, a life coach?

10:28.525 --> 10:30.335
Life is a game, Emma.

10:30.485 --> 10:33.135
You weren't born a starter.
None of us were born a starter.

10:33.285 --> 10:38.115
I mean, take Wendy here, for example,
I mean, humble beginnings, to say the least.

10:38.265 --> 10:41.666
There was a time at Berkeley, she wouldn't be
caught dead hanging out with you people.

10:42.445 --> 10:45.775
But now, she's on the varsity squad.

10:45.925 --> 10:48.925
That's my job.
I get you guys off the bench.

10:49.075 --> 10:51.775
What's keeping you from taking it to
the next level? What are you afraid of?

10:51.925 --> 10:55.079
What truth are you hiding from?
When the student is ready...

10:55.229 --> 10:57.652
the master will appear.

10:58.385 --> 11:00.375
Uncle Jay!

11:00.525 --> 11:02.079
Jay!

11:02.345 --> 11:05.875
- Ellis. Good to see you, my dude.
- It's good to see you, my dude.

11:06.025 --> 11:09.815
Everybody, this is my buddy, Chad.

11:09.965 --> 11:12.415
- Hi, Chad.
- Hi, Chad.

11:12.565 --> 11:15.159
- Hello, Chad.
- Why don't you come take a seat.

11:17.265 --> 11:19.188
- It's okay?
- It's okay.

11:19.338 --> 11:22.819
Hi, Jay bird. Glad you made it.

11:23.885 --> 11:26.785
So I'm headed into
the back country tomorrow.

11:26.935 --> 11:30.975
I met this cute hippy chick. We're gonna
let our animal instincts run wild.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.655
Chad's gonna let me use
his truck off road.

11:33.805 --> 11:36.325
Is it cool if he stays here
for a few days?

11:36.925 --> 11:39.435
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

11:39.665 --> 11:42.705
- The more the merrier.
- Cool. Chad makes films.

11:42.855 --> 11:46.275
- What kind of films?
- Nature films.

11:46.425 --> 11:48.655
What are they about?

11:48.805 --> 11:50.095
Nature.

11:50.245 --> 11:53.335
Well, you know what Thoreau
said about nature.

11:53.485 --> 11:58.859
It has no morality,
only what mankind imposes upon it.

12:00.765 --> 12:03.095
You're Saul King?

12:03.245 --> 12:04.385
Yes.

12:04.535 --> 12:09.069
I've read four books in my life
and three of them were yours.

12:09.925 --> 12:11.055
What was the other one?

12:11.205 --> 12:16.110
"The Little Big Book of Birds."
I memorized it. It's about birds.

12:17.485 --> 12:20.397
"A Covey of Coots" was funny but...

12:21.243 --> 12:23.535
I thought it was gonna be about birds.

12:24.245 --> 12:25.535
It's a metaphor.

12:25.685 --> 12:29.295
I especially liked "A Cast of Hawks"
but it wasn't about birds either.

12:29.445 --> 12:34.125
It was strange, you know, you really
could have said something interesting.

12:34.275 --> 12:37.175
Where do you get the ideas for your books?

12:37.325 --> 12:39.069
I think of them.

12:40.365 --> 12:44.039
Can I interview you? About your books.

12:45.505 --> 12:47.295
- Maybe later.
- What time?

12:47.445 --> 12:50.235
- I don't know.
- Okay. Can I...

12:50.385 --> 12:52.839
I'm so sorry, can I sleep now?

12:55.605 --> 12:57.775
My room's at the top
of the hall to the left.

12:57.925 --> 13:00.239
Do you want some dessert?

13:02.065 --> 13:04.919
- No thank you.
- Okay.

13:16.245 --> 13:18.099
Goodnight.

13:38.185 --> 13:41.725
Hey, a nightcap?

13:42.125 --> 13:45.219
Yeah, something like that.

13:47.405 --> 13:49.175
God, you look beautiful.

13:49.325 --> 13:52.339
- You really think so?
- Absolutely.

13:56.225 --> 13:59.755
No. No, Saul.

13:59.905 --> 14:03.065
- What's wrong?
- No. I can't.

14:03.465 --> 14:07.191
You know, it's funny 'cause I...
don't remember you

14:07.341 --> 14:10.955
ever writing the entire time
we were together.

14:11.105 --> 14:13.635
I don't even remember you reading a book.

14:13.785 --> 14:15.271
It's like...

14:15.421 --> 14:20.045
you left me and...
changed into somebody else.

14:21.005 --> 14:24.215
Look, I'm by myself all the time.

14:24.365 --> 14:28.655
Writing is a God-awful existence.

14:28.805 --> 14:32.545
You should be grateful
you blocked my creative voice.

14:32.885 --> 14:36.175
It would have been hell to live with.

14:36.325 --> 14:38.139
Wendy?

14:40.305 --> 14:42.423
Yes, Chad?

14:42.573 --> 14:44.979
I'm ready for my dessert now.

14:47.465 --> 14:50.979
Sure. Sure, Chad.

15:55.195 --> 15:57.589
What is it, honey?

16:01.325 --> 16:03.739
I think it's Chad.

16:05.665 --> 16:11.135
Chad! Please, come back. Chad, come back.

16:11.285 --> 16:16.539
Okay, come on. It's an antique.
It was not made to get wet, Chad.

16:18.825 --> 16:21.119
Let's do this.

16:21.545 --> 16:24.065
The truth is always beautiful.

16:25.065 --> 16:27.279
What's going on?

16:29.125 --> 16:32.285
- Dad, can you watch me swim?
- I can't.

16:33.485 --> 16:37.819
What's Chad doing out there?
He can't even swim.

16:41.325 --> 16:46.779
Hey, pal, bring it on in, will ya?
It's time to go.

17:06.565 --> 17:10.145
Okay, see you on Independence Day.

17:10.845 --> 17:13.415
May the 4th be with you.

17:40.605 --> 17:44.219
<i>There is a kind of hawk that spends
most of its time in the air.</i>

17:47.325 --> 17:49.770
<i>People think that they're hunters,</i>

17:49.920 --> 17:52.939
<i>just riding the wind, looking for prey...</i>

17:53.765 --> 17:56.859
<i>but they're really quiet and gentle...</i>

17:57.585 --> 17:59.819
<i>even secretive.</i>

18:02.965 --> 18:05.819
<i>They just like to travel alone.</i>

18:45.225 --> 18:49.975
I can't work like this. The food sucks.
The facility's insufficient.

18:50.125 --> 18:53.659
You promised me a cabin
and you stick me in this shithole.

18:56.955 --> 18:59.445
Last time this piano was tuned

18:59.595 --> 19:02.249
like he didn't have a hole in his head.

19:05.365 --> 19:08.235
Hey, you've been paid handsomely for a job

19:08.385 --> 19:11.655
many others would fall
on their goddamn knees for.

19:11.805 --> 19:14.799
What the hell is the holdup?

19:15.885 --> 19:19.019
- I'm stuck, Saul.
- You're stuck.

19:20.845 --> 19:24.419
- Let me help you out.
- No, I'm blocked.

19:27.845 --> 19:32.799
- What do you mean you're blocked?
- It's something that writers get.

19:33.825 --> 19:35.975
I got nothing.

19:36.125 --> 19:40.175
I'm blank. Done with
and washed up, the muse is gone.

19:40.325 --> 19:42.535
What the hell happened?
It just doesn't go away.

19:42.685 --> 19:45.235
- It does if you've banished it.
- Well, invite it back.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.399
I can't.

19:48.785 --> 19:50.899
I quit drinking.

19:58.665 --> 20:02.095
What the hell kind of self-destructive
behavior is that?

20:02.245 --> 20:06.145
I mean, who the hell quits drinking
in the last chapter?

20:06.295 --> 20:08.909
Maybe I do, Saul.

20:10.385 --> 20:13.859
Or maybe I'm just better than you
at making shit up, hmm?

20:14.365 --> 20:16.469
Write your own fucking books.

20:50.005 --> 20:52.215
What are you doing?

20:52.365 --> 20:54.759
You said I could interview you.

20:55.405 --> 20:58.215
- About your books.
- No, I didn't.

20:58.365 --> 21:00.979
I said "maybe." But I meant "no."

21:01.645 --> 21:03.479
Saul?

21:04.405 --> 21:09.075
You have to ask someone if you're
gonna make a documentary about them.

21:09.225 --> 21:12.299
- Yes.
- Hey, Saul.

21:18.045 --> 21:21.435
- Saul? Saul?
- <i>One. Two.</i>

21:21.585 --> 21:24.725
One, two, three, four.

21:26.025 --> 21:27.899
Yeah.

21:28.105 --> 21:32.415
All right. Here we go.
We go, one, two, three and four.

21:32.565 --> 21:34.615
That's perfect.

21:34.765 --> 21:38.235
Step high. Chins up.

21:38.385 --> 21:42.619
Here we go. Again, we go high,
high, low and low.

21:47.085 --> 21:50.595
And one last time. Make it count.

21:50.745 --> 21:53.159
Leave 'em wanting more.

21:56.205 --> 21:59.425
Yes! You guys were awesome.

22:00.025 --> 22:02.479
- Hey, Chad, this is Olivia.
- Hi, Olivia.

22:02.629 --> 22:04.995
Hi, Chad.
Joey, I'm gonna go get my bathing suit.

22:05.145 --> 22:06.939
Bye-bye.

22:08.265 --> 22:12.299
- Will you take us swimming?
- I can't swim.

22:17.645 --> 22:19.899
You really don't swim?

22:21.805 --> 22:23.619
No.

22:24.105 --> 22:27.175
Just seems wrong.
Come on, Chad, live a little.

22:27.325 --> 22:30.499
It's just water. Please?

22:31.225 --> 22:33.479
Okay, but not too far, okay?

22:42.245 --> 22:44.595
Whoa. Is that a real gun?

22:44.745 --> 22:47.535
Yeah, it's real.

22:47.685 --> 22:51.479
- Why do you have it?
- I always carry a gun.

22:52.725 --> 22:55.039
Can I hold it?

23:19.085 --> 23:21.895
- Chad's going swimming with us.
- Awesome.

23:22.045 --> 23:24.647
Come on, come on.

23:42.285 --> 23:45.605
Can we stop, please? I want to stop.

23:48.245 --> 23:52.135
I want to stop, please. Can we stop?

23:52.285 --> 23:54.139
No.

23:57.205 --> 24:01.859
Stop. Stop, please, stop! Stop! Stop!

24:03.785 --> 24:07.725
Joey, Joey, what's going on? Huh?

24:07.875 --> 24:11.375
We were just swimming and he
started freaking out. He hurt me.

24:11.525 --> 24:14.939
- He hurt you? How did he hurt you?
- He didn't mean to. We scared him.

24:18.025 --> 24:20.389
I was scared.

24:26.205 --> 24:28.882
All right, you know what?
That's enough swimming for today. Joey.

24:29.032 --> 24:32.875
- But, Mom....
- No, you're done, you're done. Honey...

24:45.285 --> 24:48.695
He lurks. He's always lurking.

24:48.845 --> 24:51.415
Who knows what's going on
in that mind of his?

24:51.565 --> 24:55.455
- He started filming me today.
- Yes, well, he's filming everybody, Saul.

24:55.605 --> 24:59.955
Yes, but he's making a documentary
about me, his favorite writer.

25:00.105 --> 25:03.935
I think he's some sort of a lunatic fan.
Where did Jay meet this guy?

25:04.085 --> 25:08.965
I don't know, but I just...
I don't fully trust him with the kids.

25:09.115 --> 25:12.395
Okay. Well, then, he's got to go.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.005
Okay.

25:15.155 --> 25:16.809
Okay.

25:17.265 --> 25:19.895
Look at us, co-parenting.

25:20.045 --> 25:22.915
- So who's gonna tell him?
- I'll tell him.

25:23.065 --> 25:25.219
I'll tell him.

25:28.045 --> 25:30.319
Hey, Chad.

25:36.965 --> 25:39.295
- I've upset you.
- No.

25:39.445 --> 25:42.739
It's just that it's not gonna work out.

25:44.405 --> 25:47.235
The truth is we weren't expecting
another person this weekend.

25:47.385 --> 25:49.464
I understand.

25:50.045 --> 25:52.124
Do you?

25:53.205 --> 25:57.024
- Yes.
- I appreciate that.

26:00.254 --> 26:03.095
You've all been really nice to me.

26:03.245 --> 26:05.584
I wish I could pay it back.

26:10.725 --> 26:13.004
Bye, Chad.

26:20.165 --> 26:23.955
- Where's Chad going?
- He had to leave, honey.

26:24.105 --> 26:26.518
But why?

26:26.668 --> 26:28.338
Well...

26:30.409 --> 26:32.935
people are like gardens.

26:33.085 --> 26:38.005
Gardens and flowers want to blossom
but weeds overpower everything

26:38.155 --> 26:42.913
and flowers learn to tolerate weeds
but if they can't...

26:43.463 --> 26:46.814
the weeds need to be pulled
to save the garden.

26:54.585 --> 26:57.164
Who decides what's a weed?

27:33.285 --> 27:36.904
Joey, just don't make
any sudden movements.

27:41.165 --> 27:43.235
Not coming with?

27:43.385 --> 27:46.035
No, thank you. Just gonna take a walk.

27:46.185 --> 27:48.355
I'll walk with you.

27:48.505 --> 27:52.044
Yeah, sure, if it's all right with Hal.

27:55.025 --> 27:59.375
I didn't have a family so it's really lovely
to see one with so much love.

27:59.525 --> 28:01.555
Why didn't you have a family?

28:01.705 --> 28:07.192
Oh, my dad died when I was young
and my mom took off on her Saturn return

28:07.342 --> 28:10.115
and I've been on my own since I was 14.

28:10.365 --> 28:13.015
14, that's young.

28:13.165 --> 28:15.895
No, no, no, no. It was perfect.

28:16.045 --> 28:21.015
To be free at that age, not having
to repress all that sexual energy,

28:21.165 --> 28:24.135
I can't imagine having lived
any differently.

28:24.285 --> 28:26.475
I definitely learned a thing or two.

28:26.625 --> 28:28.815
I can imagine you did.

28:28.965 --> 28:31.805
You need to fuck my yoni puja.

28:32.605 --> 28:34.644
Wow.

28:35.405 --> 28:38.025
Wow, that's flattering.

28:38.529 --> 28:41.975
I appreciate it. But I love my wife.

28:42.125 --> 28:45.115
That's okay. I do too.
I would love to please both of you.

28:45.265 --> 28:48.035
Okay, Saturn, I need you to stop.

28:48.185 --> 28:51.664
This entire conversation
is making me very uncomfortable.

28:55.255 --> 28:58.575
I haven't felt like this
since my father died.

29:04.325 --> 29:06.124
Chad?

29:07.905 --> 29:12.465
There's a tribe of tit warblers
nesting in that juniper tree.

29:13.365 --> 29:18.246
- Where? I don't see them.
- They're more easily heard than seen.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.124
I have gifts.

29:29.405 --> 29:32.057
Look who I found, everybody.

29:33.585 --> 29:36.345
It's Chad. He brought gifts.

29:36.495 --> 29:38.044
Awesome.

29:38.645 --> 29:40.845
Gifts? Why?

29:40.995 --> 29:43.325
For being so kind to me. To pay it back.

29:43.475 --> 29:48.394
- Chad, you didn't have to do that.
- Yes, Wendy, I did.

29:50.765 --> 29:55.626
Ellis, this is for you
because Wendy love flowers.

29:57.325 --> 29:59.635
Oh, beautiful.

29:59.785 --> 30:02.775
I thank you, Chad,
for your floral support.

30:02.925 --> 30:04.139
- And Saul?
- Yeah?

30:04.289 --> 30:05.345
- Saul?
- Yeah?

30:05.495 --> 30:07.795
- Saul?
- Yeah?

30:07.945 --> 30:10.504
Saul, this is for you.

30:17.135 --> 30:20.884
Very interesting choice, Chad. I like it.

30:22.285 --> 30:24.824
Oh! Uh, I have something for you.

30:26.685 --> 30:30.084
- So you brought him back?
- He's harmless.

30:31.885 --> 30:35.424
- For our lemonade stand.
- Perfect.

30:59.725 --> 31:02.065
Why are you standing so awkwardly?

31:02.385 --> 31:05.015
- I'll go stand over there.
- No, I didn't mean that.

31:05.165 --> 31:08.924
- I meant, are you feeling uncomfortable?
- Yeah.

31:09.325 --> 31:12.455
Most of the time. All the time, actually.

31:12.605 --> 31:14.484
Why?

31:16.045 --> 31:18.115
It's how I feel.

31:18.265 --> 31:20.504
Take a seat, Chad.

31:26.425 --> 31:30.095
If we're going to be best friends,
we have to tell each other a secret,

31:30.245 --> 31:33.133
a secret we've never told anyone else.

31:33.845 --> 31:36.264
I have to tell you a secret?

31:42.865 --> 31:45.424
I left school when I was your age.

31:47.145 --> 31:49.524
I preferred watching birds.

31:54.385 --> 31:57.744
- But I have an even bigger secret.
- Really?

31:58.825 --> 32:02.415
I chose you as my friend
because you're perfect.

32:02.565 --> 32:05.995
- Or just I'm amazing.
- You are amazing.

32:06.145 --> 32:08.255
What amazing things
do you think I'm going to do?

32:08.405 --> 32:11.575
No, if I tell you you'll think I'm silly.

32:11.725 --> 32:14.184
Please tell me.

32:15.525 --> 32:17.815
I think you're gonna make people smile.

32:17.965 --> 32:20.575
That's important, you know?

32:20.725 --> 32:23.611
And I'm pretty sure you're gonna
cure cancer and end hate too, so...

32:23.761 --> 32:26.395
you've got a big life in front of you.

32:26.645 --> 32:29.204
Cool, you're right.

32:33.605 --> 32:35.544
Your turn.

32:39.465 --> 32:41.695
Everyone lies to me.

32:41.845 --> 32:43.705
Why?

32:44.005 --> 32:46.863
'Cause they think the truth
will hurt me more.

32:47.265 --> 32:50.484
You have to promise
not to lie to me, okay?

32:52.885 --> 32:54.764
Promise.

33:34.765 --> 33:38.155
So I'm raising equity for a new startup.
We're in our very first round of financing.

33:38.305 --> 33:40.855
I thought it might be something
you'd be interested in.

33:41.005 --> 33:42.545
Okay, what's the company?

33:42.695 --> 33:46.615
It's not so much of a company per se
as it is seed money.

33:46.765 --> 33:52.005
Investing in the daily cog of my life.
What you'd be investing in is my expertise.

33:53.405 --> 33:55.255
Your expertise?

33:55.405 --> 33:58.475
You're a trust fund kid, Ellis.
I wouldn't know your expertise,

33:58.625 --> 34:01.895
if you put a handgun to my head. Anyway,
a high percentage of these startups fail,

34:02.045 --> 34:06.035
and there's always the risk of losing
your friend's money and the friendship.

34:06.185 --> 34:08.215
I'm just asking for a little bit of help.

34:08.364 --> 34:11.255
Look, Ellis, the last thing that I want

34:11.405 --> 34:15.094
is for these family reunions to turn
more into what the startup is doing

34:15.245 --> 34:18.485
than about catching up
with friends and family.

34:18.985 --> 34:21.744
I just don't think I'm the right guy.

34:22.685 --> 34:24.445
Yup.

34:24.844 --> 34:28.364
Yup, well, your loss.

34:40.385 --> 34:43.676
Bees! Bees!

34:46.465 --> 34:48.522
Bees!

35:03.945 --> 35:06.325
Did he call?

35:06.825 --> 35:09.955
- No.
- He's such an asshole.

35:10.105 --> 35:13.185
We were supposed to play
the small ball tonight.

35:14.085 --> 35:17.245
Hey, at least we have each other.

35:17.645 --> 35:19.365
Right?

35:28.785 --> 35:33.325
I got attacked by a whole
goddamned swarm of bees.

35:33.475 --> 35:35.435
It's this fucking shirt.

35:35.585 --> 35:40.185
Jesus, it's like they think they can
smell nectar on me or something.

35:40.885 --> 35:43.114
Bees can sense fear.

35:54.825 --> 35:57.864
Sorry. Sorry.

35:58.825 --> 36:01.055
He did this on purpose.

36:01.205 --> 36:03.235
Did what on purpose?

36:03.385 --> 36:06.539
Give me a shirt that was meant to kill me.

36:06.689 --> 36:08.655
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

36:08.805 --> 36:12.685
Jay's coming back tomorrow.
Let's just let it go for now, okay?

36:13.385 --> 36:15.944
Oh, that feels good.

36:17.685 --> 36:19.705
You're very pretty.

36:20.205 --> 36:22.064
Thanks.

36:25.325 --> 36:26.876
- Come on.
- No.

36:27.026 --> 36:29.055
- Come on.
- I'm not in the mood.

36:29.205 --> 36:31.735
Then how about just doing it for me?

36:31.885 --> 36:33.675
- I don't want to.
- Come on, Wendy.

36:33.825 --> 36:36.414
Ellis, I don't want to.

36:39.025 --> 36:42.595
- Are you still in love with him?
- With who?

36:42.745 --> 36:45.335
Saul. Saul, Wendy.

36:45.485 --> 36:48.655
No. Why? Did he say something to you?

36:48.805 --> 36:50.555
No.

36:50.705 --> 36:54.495
No, he didn't say anything.
I could see it with my own eyes.

36:54.645 --> 36:57.095
Look, maybe I'm the small person here

36:57.245 --> 37:00.645
but this whole being friends
with the ex-husband thing, it's weird.

37:00.795 --> 37:03.095
I have a child with him.
I mean, what do you want me to do?

37:03.245 --> 37:07.525
I want to feel like you love me the most.

37:07.825 --> 37:11.745
I don't want to talk about this right now,
okay? We have a full house of guests.

37:11.895 --> 37:14.015
- What more can I do?
- Ellis.

37:14.165 --> 37:17.315
- What... what more can I do?
- Ellis.

37:17.465 --> 37:20.025
- Huh?
- I can't do this. I'm sorry.

37:20.365 --> 37:22.244
No...

37:26.385 --> 37:29.784
How much rejection am I supposed to take?

37:40.965 --> 37:43.984
What's the best nap you've ever taken?

37:46.485 --> 37:49.095
When I was little,
I used to pretend to be asleep

37:49.245 --> 37:52.075
so I could hear my mom
and Dad talk about me.

37:52.225 --> 37:54.555
They would say, "That one's a goner"

37:54.705 --> 37:57.055
and then my dad would pick me up
and carry me to bed.

37:57.205 --> 38:00.375
- Yeah?
- How about you?

38:00.525 --> 38:04.264
I haven't really fallen asleep
in a long time.

38:10.925 --> 38:13.164
Hey, buddy.

38:19.095 --> 38:21.185
Do you think a kitty hurt it?

38:21.335 --> 38:23.595
Baby birds fall or...

38:23.745 --> 38:26.515
and sometimes they get pushed
from their nest.

38:26.665 --> 38:29.745
- Why?
- To learn to fly.

38:30.445 --> 38:32.135
That's mean.

38:32.285 --> 38:34.655
No, it's normal.

38:34.805 --> 38:39.135
And if it's feathered, it's a fledgling
and has left the nest on its own.

38:39.285 --> 38:41.975
Then you leave it where you found it.

38:42.125 --> 38:46.484
If it's unfeathered,
then you look for a nest.

38:48.045 --> 38:50.417
And if you find it...

38:51.723 --> 38:54.091
you can bring it home.

39:19.385 --> 39:21.169
Chad!

39:21.319 --> 39:23.624
Wait for me.

39:33.485 --> 39:35.814
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

39:37.725 --> 39:40.335
Joey, I want you to come down right now.

39:40.485 --> 39:43.415
I want you to come down
on solid ground right now.

39:43.565 --> 39:47.175
- Why do you care?
- I'm gonna count to 10.

39:47.325 --> 39:50.455
- You mean 3.
- I mean 10!

39:50.605 --> 39:52.459
One.

39:52.859 --> 39:55.035
Joey, don't make me
come up there, after you.

39:55.185 --> 39:57.924
I want you to get down
from there right now.

39:58.685 --> 40:01.915
Okay, fine, I'll come up there.
I can climb a tree.

40:02.065 --> 40:04.965
I don't know why anybody would ever

40:05.115 --> 40:08.455
want to climb a goddamn tree
and bring a little child up.

40:08.805 --> 40:13.215
Let's all climb a tree,
let's climb trees and free the birds,

40:13.365 --> 40:17.205
because then, everything's good
and our wives aren't emotionally distant.

40:17.355 --> 40:19.774
Goddamn it!

40:20.205 --> 40:24.024
Don't look at me. Look at me.

40:26.925 --> 40:30.504
Joey. Joey, baby, help me up.

40:31.625 --> 40:34.944
This is how people
ride it out, huh, please?

40:45.065 --> 40:48.104
See you later, sadly.

40:53.435 --> 40:57.064
<i>I read that frightened birds
will freeze in place.</i>

40:57.945 --> 41:00.775
<i>Hoping that they won't be seen or heard</i>

41:00.925 --> 41:03.464
<i>when they're scared or in trouble.</i>

41:05.155 --> 41:07.085
<i>But some birds fly alone.</i>

41:07.235 --> 41:09.565
<i>They're the ones that fly the highest.</i>

41:09.715 --> 41:12.024
<i>And they can see the most.</i>

41:13.395 --> 41:17.334
<i>They can fly so high,
that they vanish into thin air...</i>

41:22.515 --> 41:24.774
<i>like a dream.</i>

41:54.555 --> 41:57.135
Do you know where I go every day...

41:57.535 --> 42:00.375
when I say I'm leaving for work?

42:00.975 --> 42:03.645
I actually go to the driving range

42:03.795 --> 42:07.625
which is ironic considering
that my golf game is for shit.

42:07.775 --> 42:10.575
Just like the rest of my life.

42:11.075 --> 42:15.325
And then if I'm really, really motivated,

42:15.475 --> 42:18.655
I'll come home and I'll jerk off.

42:19.155 --> 42:22.345
That is the sum total of my day.

42:22.495 --> 42:25.094
Sounds pretty good to me, bro.

42:26.635 --> 42:31.552
No, man, you've kind of got to have
your shit together to smoke this. Sorry.

42:31.935 --> 42:33.387
You know...

42:33.537 --> 42:36.415
we live life like it's supposed
to be a certain way and...

42:36.565 --> 42:39.965
when that doesn't happen,
we think that life is wrong.

42:40.115 --> 42:44.505
But you're in control, bro. I mean,
your hands are on the steering wheel.

42:44.655 --> 42:48.005
You crash your car into a tree,
you don't blame the tree.

42:48.155 --> 42:51.654
You could have it all. Like me.

42:53.335 --> 42:56.585
What are you talking about, Hal?
You're not doing anything with your life.

42:56.735 --> 42:59.425
Yeah, but that's the point, man.
That's my choice.

42:59.575 --> 43:02.965
That's what makes me happy and, fuck you,
because I'm right here right now,

43:03.115 --> 43:05.885
which is more than you can say.

43:06.035 --> 43:11.019
You create what you want to create for
yourself, bro. You just gotta keep it real.

43:13.115 --> 43:17.194
So... what is it you want?

43:28.955 --> 43:31.155
- Saul wants to have a baby.
- Really?

43:31.305 --> 43:34.885
- You're surprised.
- I thought he didn't even like children.

43:35.035 --> 43:37.025
He barely even looks at Joey.

43:37.175 --> 43:39.125
I don't think liking children
has anything to do with it.

43:39.275 --> 43:42.845
I think he just wants to have something
of his own, something that he made.

43:42.995 --> 43:48.312
He's made up this story about himself and
now he's convinced himself that it's true.

43:49.115 --> 43:53.465
- Are you pregnant?
- No. Why, do I look fat?

43:53.615 --> 43:58.833
No. No, I just thought since you said
Saul wanted to have a baby.

43:58.983 --> 44:02.145
Wendy, I am not just a vessel
for that man's needs.

44:02.295 --> 44:05.965
You know, my body is not here
merely just to deliver a child.

44:06.115 --> 44:09.011
I told him to get his own uterus.

44:09.315 --> 44:11.189
Or have it with someone else.

44:11.615 --> 44:15.854
And you know Saul, tell him
he can't have something and...

44:18.875 --> 44:20.874
He tricked me.

44:22.355 --> 44:24.356
What did you do?

44:24.975 --> 44:26.814
I...

44:30.975 --> 44:33.414
The love is lost.

44:34.275 --> 44:37.695
And when it's all gone...

44:38.195 --> 44:41.094
it's surprising how freeing it is.

44:42.335 --> 44:44.734
Just not a care.

45:10.775 --> 45:12.645
What can I help you with?

45:12.795 --> 45:17.685
I have an anniversary coming up
next week. It's my tenth, big one.

45:17.835 --> 45:21.345
And I'm honestly not sure
if my marriage is gonna make it 'til then

45:21.495 --> 45:25.285
unless I do something big.

45:25.835 --> 45:28.255
Anything to do with the...

45:28.405 --> 45:31.725
Oh, the bee stings?
No, that's just shit luck.

45:31.875 --> 45:35.205
Okay. Tell me a little bit
about your wife.

45:35.355 --> 45:37.595
What does she... what does she like?

45:37.745 --> 45:39.136
Okay.

45:40.475 --> 45:45.585
You know what? Why don't you just
show me the most expensive ring you have?

45:46.285 --> 45:48.065
Okay.

45:48.265 --> 45:50.808
That would be...

45:51.329 --> 45:53.245
this right here.

45:53.395 --> 45:56.691
This is a 6.5 carat

45:56.841 --> 46:00.129
GIA certified cushion-cut diamond.

46:01.167 --> 46:04.565
It's very pretty. How much is that one?

46:04.815 --> 46:07.935
It's $250,000.

46:08.515 --> 46:13.365
You know what? Could you maybe show me
something a little less expensive?

46:13.515 --> 46:15.321
Okay.

46:18.275 --> 46:21.105
That's pretty.
It's smaller, it's definitely smaller,

46:21.255 --> 46:24.445
but a woman would like that, wouldn't she?

46:24.595 --> 46:26.654
I would.

48:24.515 --> 48:27.734
<i>Ravens usually nest together for life.</i>

48:29.855 --> 48:32.564
<i>But sometimes they visit
with other ravens.</i>

48:34.235 --> 48:37.325
<i>Maybe this is because
they like shiny things</i>

48:37.475 --> 48:41.024
<i>and will even steal them
from other birds' nests.</i>

48:45.475 --> 48:49.724
<i>Anyways, that's what
"The Little Big Book" says.</i>

48:52.155 --> 48:55.185
<i>But I think they're looking
for something that's missing</i>

48:55.335 --> 48:57.804
<i>and they don't know what it is.</i>

48:59.555 --> 49:02.344
<i>And they don't know where to find it.</i>

49:24.255 --> 49:26.735
What did you tell him?

49:27.235 --> 49:29.685
I told him I quit.

49:29.835 --> 49:31.884
You quit?

49:33.555 --> 49:35.784
Oh, my God.

49:38.155 --> 49:40.813
You are amazing.

49:41.355 --> 49:43.644
Will, you did it.

49:44.655 --> 49:46.885
We're free.

49:50.555 --> 49:54.133
- Not exactly.
- What does that mean?

49:55.715 --> 49:59.565
It started out slow
and it's just gotten real fast.

49:59.715 --> 50:01.984
What does that mean?

50:03.155 --> 50:05.975
I told him I quit drinking.
I definitely told him that.

50:06.125 --> 50:09.934
Oh, shit. Oh!

50:11.285 --> 50:12.335
So he doesn't know.

50:12.485 --> 50:15.515
I look at him
and I'm paralyzed with dread.

50:15.665 --> 50:19.995
Yeah, he has that effect.
So what did you tell him?

50:20.145 --> 50:22.994
I definitely told him
he's not the boss of me.

50:25.285 --> 50:27.714
I'm sorry, Emma.

50:28.485 --> 50:32.494
I'm just tired and just
really tired of all of it.

50:33.405 --> 50:35.834
You're not gonna say anything?

50:37.625 --> 50:40.374
It's not easy for me, either, you know?

50:43.425 --> 50:46.154
Just a couple of phonies, aren't we?

50:51.225 --> 50:53.885
<i>We're here today with Saul King,
a former Wall Street Whiz Kid</i>

50:54.035 --> 50:56.710
<i>who was the first American author
to hit the number one spot</i>

50:56.860 --> 50:59.185
<i>with his debut since F. Scott Fitzgerald.</i>

50:59.335 --> 51:02.515
<i>Mr. King's work has been described
as a strange mix of the mythic,</i>

51:02.665 --> 51:04.634
<i>the slightly implausible and...</i>

51:39.885 --> 51:41.695
<i>Thank you, Mr. King, for joining us today.</i>

51:41.845 --> 51:44.895
<i>Terri, it's nice to be here. Thanks so much
for coming along to my house.</i>

51:45.045 --> 51:47.375
- <i>I really appreciate it.</i>
- <i>It's wonderful to be here.</i>

51:47.525 --> 51:51.615
<i>So, Mr. King, tell me,
where do you find your inspiration?</i>

51:51.765 --> 51:55.035
<i>Terri, a story is like a beautiful woman.</i>

51:55.185 --> 51:58.155
<i>For me, writing is like making love.</i>

52:04.605 --> 52:07.415
<i>Wonderful. Do you...</i>

52:07.565 --> 52:10.815
<i>Do you find yourself writing
wherever you are in the world?</i>

52:10.965 --> 52:13.791
<i>Do you have a certain place
where you to write?</i>

52:59.525 --> 53:01.414
Woo!

53:01.925 --> 53:05.794
Oh, I mean, could this be more beautiful?

53:08.205 --> 53:10.034
Actually...

53:11.025 --> 53:13.254
yes, it can.

53:15.885 --> 53:18.134
What is that?

53:51.245 --> 53:53.974
This shit's not working at all.

54:15.485 --> 54:17.175
What are you talking about?

54:17.325 --> 54:21.482
I love you so much and I get it,
I understand fear, you know?

54:21.632 --> 54:24.875
I walk into the tiger's mouth
every fucking day.

54:25.025 --> 54:27.615
I got a lot of things
that terrify me, you know?

54:27.765 --> 54:32.235
Spiders and big-ass fucking
malicious hairy predators

54:32.385 --> 54:36.555
and, you know, I'm scared of...
Saturn scares me.

54:36.705 --> 54:38.814
Really scares me.

54:41.965 --> 54:43.793
Chad?

54:44.065 --> 54:45.944
What the fuck am I doing?

55:13.105 --> 55:15.475
You betrayed the cause.
We were gonna change the world.

55:15.625 --> 55:18.125
- Oh, yeah.
- I like money. Everybody likes money.

55:18.275 --> 55:22.794
I like money.
But do you really need all this shit?

57:08.885 --> 57:10.614
Hey.

57:17.105 --> 57:21.255
- Why did you bring him?
- Because he's our house guest, Ellis.

57:21.405 --> 57:24.434
Can't just leave him
at the house by himself.

57:25.285 --> 57:29.454
What are you gonna put on, Chad?
Phil Collins?

57:52.825 --> 57:59.274
<i># I got green and I got blues #</i>

58:00.605 --> 58:06.794
<i># And every day there's a little less
difference between the two #</i>

58:08.005 --> 58:13.894
<i># I belly up and disappear #</i>

58:16.145 --> 58:21.574
<i># Well, I ain't really drowning
'cause I see the beach from here #</i>

58:23.865 --> 58:27.775
<i># And I could take a Greyhound home #</i>

58:27.925 --> 58:31.232
<i># But when I got there it'd be gone #</i>

58:31.382 --> 58:37.134
<i># Along with everything
a home is made up of #</i>

58:39.125 --> 58:42.995
<i># So I'll take two of what you're having #</i>

58:43.145 --> 58:46.495
<i># And I'll take all of what you've got #</i>

58:46.645 --> 58:52.734
<i># To kill this goddamn lonely,
goddamn lonely love #</i>

58:57.585 --> 59:00.303
You never gave me a gift.

59:02.225 --> 59:04.554
Honey, that's enough.

59:10.185 --> 59:15.683
<i># Sister, listen to what your daddy says #</i>

59:17.565 --> 59:23.935
<i># Don't be ashamed of things
that hide behind your dress #</i>

59:24.085 --> 59:26.345
Wendy, stop it!

59:26.534 --> 59:32.074
<i># Belly up and arch your back #</i>

59:33.965 --> 59:36.255
- You two...
- Get off me!

59:36.405 --> 59:40.317
- Get off me! Get off me!
- Don't fuck with my wife!

59:41.005 --> 59:45.035
<i># And you could come to me by plane #</i>

59:45.185 --> 59:48.595
<i># But that wouldn't be the same #</i>

59:48.745 --> 59:55.465
<i># As that old motel room
in Texarkana was #</i>

59:56.565 --> 59:58.855
<i># So I'll take two of what... #</i>

59:59.005 --> 01:00:00.934
I don't want to be touched.

01:00:03.045 --> 01:00:06.465
- Wendy.
- You're drunk. Go home.

01:00:07.265 --> 01:00:11.034
<i># ...goddamn lonely love #</i>

01:00:20.745 --> 01:00:25.355

<i># And leaves before his ashes

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:23.775
You asleep?

01:01:23.925 --> 01:01:25.774
Yeah.

01:01:31.805 --> 01:01:33.994
Did you finish?

01:01:35.405 --> 01:01:38.204
- Do you want to read it?
- No.

01:01:39.835 --> 01:01:42.124
Does it feel good?

01:01:42.935 --> 01:01:44.344
Yeah.

01:01:46.505 --> 01:01:48.874
I love you, Will.

01:01:52.935 --> 01:01:55.204
I love me, too.

01:02:25.345 --> 01:02:28.074
The fireworks have started.

01:02:28.475 --> 01:02:30.464
They're so loud.

01:02:34.975 --> 01:02:37.244
Are you okay?

01:02:39.505 --> 01:02:41.285
No.

01:02:41.685 --> 01:02:43.854
No, I'm not.

01:02:47.345 --> 01:02:49.634
Sit with me.

01:03:08.805 --> 01:03:11.314
My dad always wanted a boy.

01:03:18.885 --> 01:03:21.024
That's why he named me Joey.

01:03:23.905 --> 01:03:26.874
I disappointed my dad by being a girl...

01:03:27.925 --> 01:03:31.194
and my mom by being too much like my dad.

01:03:40.125 --> 01:03:42.754
I think that's why my dad left...

01:03:44.005 --> 01:03:46.454
'cause when he looks at me...

01:03:47.405 --> 01:03:49.594
he sees himself.

01:03:56.365 --> 01:03:59.374
- It's all my fault.
- Hey...

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:02.835
You're just a kid.

01:04:02.985 --> 01:04:05.354
How could it be your fault?

01:04:07.425 --> 01:04:10.614
I know my family
will never be together again.

01:04:11.585 --> 01:04:13.854
But I still hope.

01:04:14.845 --> 01:04:17.154
Is that crazy?

01:04:18.445 --> 01:04:20.234
No.

01:04:21.865 --> 01:04:24.334
No, I don't think it is.

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:15.254
<i>Ravens are territorial
and like digging up against other birds,</i>

01:05:16.085 --> 01:05:19.254
<i>especially when they're near their nests.</i>

01:05:19.665 --> 01:05:23.510
<i>Anyways, that's what
"The Little Big Book" says...</i>

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:26.255
<i>but I think the book is wrong.</i>

01:05:26.405 --> 01:05:28.675
<i>They're just bullies.</i>

01:05:28.825 --> 01:05:31.454
<i>They're the ones that are scared.</i>

01:05:39.905 --> 01:05:41.935
It's so beautiful.

01:05:42.085 --> 01:05:43.874
Yeah.

01:06:04.145 --> 01:06:06.015
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:06:06.165 --> 01:06:09.014
Is there a Mr. Saul King staying here?

01:06:10.725 --> 01:06:14.754
Mr. King was involved in a hostile
incident with a taxi yesterday.

01:06:15.275 --> 01:06:17.824
Mr. King, you need to come with me.

01:07:06.685 --> 01:07:08.655
Thanks for picking me up.

01:07:08.805 --> 01:07:10.894
You're welcome.

01:07:13.165 --> 01:07:15.574
I want a divorce, Saul.

01:07:16.185 --> 01:07:19.725
Jesus Christ, Emma.
Do we have to do this shit tonight again?

01:07:20.425 --> 01:07:23.335
It's been a hard enough day. I swear to
God every time you get 3 drinks in you,

01:07:23.485 --> 01:07:25.267
- you want to get a goddamn divorce.
- I'm completely sober.

01:07:25.417 --> 01:07:28.140
I've never felt this clear.

01:07:32.745 --> 01:07:35.054
I've been unfaithful.

01:07:39.505 --> 01:07:41.994
So there's that.

01:07:44.565 --> 01:07:47.295
You're unbelievable.

01:07:47.445 --> 01:07:50.395
Don't tell me you're fucking someone else

01:07:50.545 --> 01:07:53.655
and expect me to fall out
of my goddamn chair, okay?

01:07:53.805 --> 01:07:56.415
Your delicate sensibilities
can go fuck themselves.

01:07:56.565 --> 01:08:00.695
You have no soul.
You're a fraud and, you know,

01:08:00.845 --> 01:08:06.219
I permitted myself to be swallowed up
by you for years and, you know, now...

01:08:06.369 --> 01:08:10.405
I just feel like I'm coming
out of this long, slow, dream.

01:08:11.105 --> 01:08:12.994
Don't you think
this is a little bit dramatic?

01:08:13.144 --> 01:08:16.383
Don't speak for me. For once,
just don't fucking speak for me!

01:08:16.533 --> 01:08:21.194
There you go. Every time you try to win
an argument, you've gotta scream.

01:08:24.825 --> 01:08:27.134
I know about your lie.

01:08:27.984 --> 01:08:30.073
Which one?

01:08:31.765 --> 01:08:34.134
How's the writing going, Saul?

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:38.225
You repulse me.

01:08:38.765 --> 01:08:41.533
I just don't love you anymore, Saul.

01:08:53.045 --> 01:08:55.634
I don't love you either...

01:08:56.385 --> 01:08:59.014
and I never have.

01:09:04.205 --> 01:09:06.234
Thank you.

01:09:37.365 --> 01:09:39.354
You okay?

01:09:39.765 --> 01:09:41.515
No.

01:09:41.665 --> 01:09:44.237
My wife just left me.

01:09:46.965 --> 01:09:49.434
What are you gonna do?

01:09:56.745 --> 01:09:59.435
- In my bedroom?
- Yes. I'll just use it,

01:09:59.585 --> 01:10:01.914
just for a moment, okay?

01:10:02.885 --> 01:10:04.914
Come here.

01:10:07.625 --> 01:10:12.415
Mother of my only daughter,
I need to fuck you so bad.

01:10:12.565 --> 01:10:16.075
I don't mean to be pushy but I think
if I could just fuck you once more,

01:10:16.225 --> 01:10:18.595
I mean, completely fuck you,

01:10:18.745 --> 01:10:22.814
that everything in my life would be okay.

01:10:24.125 --> 01:10:26.355
No! Saul.

01:10:26.505 --> 01:10:28.275
- No.
- What?

01:10:28.425 --> 01:10:30.455
Goddammit.

01:10:30.605 --> 01:10:32.883
Don't fucking walk away from me.

01:10:33.033 --> 01:10:36.815
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not your wife anymore.

01:10:36.965 --> 01:10:40.814
I have my own problems.
I don't need any of yours.

01:10:41.625 --> 01:10:43.975
What are you doing? What is it you want?

01:10:44.125 --> 01:10:47.205
I'm dying here, Wendy. I need you.

01:10:47.355 --> 01:10:49.775
You don't need me.

01:10:49.925 --> 01:10:53.655
You're just trying to get your dick back
because you lost someone you care about.

01:10:53.805 --> 01:10:58.815
Why can't you just admit that you care
about her, that you actually feel something?

01:10:58.965 --> 01:11:01.695
And why don't you just admit
that there's no difference

01:11:01.845 --> 01:11:07.135
between fucking someone for $10
and fucking them for $10 million?

01:11:07.445 --> 01:11:09.775
This is a whore's house, Wendy.

01:11:09.925 --> 01:11:14.514
Fuck you! Fuck you! Get out of my house.

01:11:23.065 --> 01:11:24.894
Daddy.

01:11:25.325 --> 01:11:27.914
Daddy, can I show you something?

01:11:33.405 --> 01:11:35.794
I made it for you.

01:11:45.965 --> 01:11:47.854
Hey.

01:11:56.285 --> 01:11:58.256
How do you like it?

01:11:58.485 --> 01:12:02.353
Well, let's hope it doesn't rain.

01:12:02.845 --> 01:12:06.645
- Yeah, I built it myself.
- Well, the seats are comfortable.

01:12:06.795 --> 01:12:12.173
- Honey, I have to go.
- Wait, I made you something.

01:12:21.565 --> 01:12:22.894
Thanks.

01:12:24.565 --> 01:12:27.074
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

01:12:27.965 --> 01:12:30.395
Wait. Can I ask you a favor?

01:12:30.545 --> 01:12:32.091
Go ahead.

01:12:32.241 --> 01:12:35.574
Can you at least pretend
to be interested in me?

01:12:36.785 --> 01:12:39.495
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm interested in you.

01:12:39.645 --> 01:12:42.116
No, you're not. And that's okay.

01:12:42.266 --> 01:12:45.355
Just thought we could be
honest about our relationship.

01:12:45.505 --> 01:12:48.194
I don't want to feel like a fake.

01:12:48.785 --> 01:12:51.395
Are you calling your father a fake?

01:12:51.545 --> 01:12:53.594
Kind of.

01:12:56.125 --> 01:12:58.394
Come here.

01:13:17.385 --> 01:13:19.514
You blinked.

01:13:41.545 --> 01:13:44.154
Are you fucking my wife?

01:13:50.925 --> 01:13:52.714
Yes.

01:13:54.005 --> 01:13:56.254
How'd you know?

01:13:56.905 --> 01:14:01.534
A woman like that doesn't leave you
unless she's climbing up the food chain.

01:14:03.635 --> 01:14:05.674
Thanks.

01:14:09.345 --> 01:14:13.185
- You didn't finish.
- No.

01:14:13.335 --> 01:14:16.264
I am too tired to hit you.

01:14:25.695 --> 01:14:28.724
I'm choosing the life
that I want to live, Saul.

01:14:29.905 --> 01:14:33.554
Not haunting hotel rooms,
anonymous to the world.

01:14:35.625 --> 01:14:38.254
I have a story and it will be heard.

01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:43.495
- What is this?
- It's your masterpiece.

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:46.692
It's a list of crimes starting
with fraud, ending with assault.

01:14:46.842 --> 01:14:50.875
It might be the best story
you've ever told.

01:14:51.325 --> 01:14:53.614
It's yours, at least.

01:15:08.645 --> 01:15:11.215
- What do you want?
- A clear conscience.

01:15:11.365 --> 01:15:14.303
- That sounds expensive.
- Hm.

01:15:21.585 --> 01:15:24.854
Truth must always come first.

01:15:25.625 --> 01:15:29.274
It's the only thing we never had.

01:15:36.925 --> 01:15:38.794
Shit.

01:15:40.465 --> 01:15:42.794
Hey, Provider-Dad.

01:15:43.235 --> 01:15:45.445
Are you coming to
the 4th of July party with us?

01:15:45.595 --> 01:15:47.895
Well, that sounds fun
but why don't you guys go ahead?

01:15:48.045 --> 01:15:50.535
What do you mean? It's the 4th of July.

01:15:50.685 --> 01:15:55.455
Cotton candies, candy apples, clowns.

01:15:55.605 --> 01:15:59.894
Why don't you guys go on without me?
I'll catch up with you later.

01:16:15.885 --> 01:16:17.616
What are you doing?

01:16:29.305 --> 01:16:31.514
I want you to have this.

01:16:39.285 --> 01:16:43.540
If you ever have any questions
about anything...

01:16:44.285 --> 01:16:46.894
all the answers are in there.

01:17:01.885 --> 01:17:03.714
Chad.

01:17:15.045 --> 01:17:17.315
How's it going, bro?
Did you have a good time?

01:17:17.465 --> 01:17:20.935
Yeah. Everyone was very kind to me.
I want to go home now, though.

01:17:21.085 --> 01:17:25.795
Hm. What do you say we just roll here
with the primates a little while longer?

01:17:25.945 --> 01:17:28.875
Then we're out of here, easy-peasy.

01:17:29.025 --> 01:17:30.914
Jay.

01:17:34.925 --> 01:17:36.431
Hey.

01:17:36.581 --> 01:17:40.014
Oh, my gosh, you must be starving, huh?

01:17:41.205 --> 01:17:43.374
Happy fourth.

01:20:20.245 --> 01:20:21.954
Chad.

01:20:22.104 --> 01:20:24.274
Yes, Saul.

01:20:26.365 --> 01:20:28.874
I'd like to have a word with you.

01:20:48.725 --> 01:20:52.175
- You're all gussied up.
- Thank you.

01:20:52.325 --> 01:20:55.975
I had it made for a funeral.

01:20:56.125 --> 01:20:57.943
Oh.

01:20:58.445 --> 01:21:02.434
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you. Are you working?

01:21:08.285 --> 01:21:11.687
I wanted to ask you if you'd be willing...

01:21:12.439 --> 01:21:15.267
to read my new book?

01:21:18.285 --> 01:21:20.495
But there's a catch.

01:21:20.645 --> 01:21:22.874
You'd be the first.

01:21:25.015 --> 01:21:27.484
How does that sound?

01:21:28.015 --> 01:21:30.304
I'd like that, Saul.

01:21:33.085 --> 01:21:35.014
Is it about birds?

01:21:52.485 --> 01:21:54.834
You tell me.

01:22:58.905 --> 01:23:01.335
Did you finish?

01:23:01.485 --> 01:23:03.274
Yes.

01:23:06.645 --> 01:23:09.525
He's too good for this world and...

01:23:10.525 --> 01:23:13.119
he lives but...

01:23:13.869 --> 01:23:15.985
he doesn't.

01:23:17.005 --> 01:23:21.954
He needs to die
so that he can live forever.

01:23:33.545 --> 01:23:35.994
Anything else?

01:23:36.645 --> 01:23:39.154
I don't like what it's called.

01:23:40.105 --> 01:23:42.414
Any suggestions?

01:23:43.725 --> 01:23:46.034
"Give Up the Ghost."

01:23:51.865 --> 01:23:55.154
You're not gonna go run off
some place, are you?

01:23:59.085 --> 01:24:00.414
No.

01:24:01.365 --> 01:24:03.594
That's good.

01:24:03.745 --> 01:24:05.784
That's good.

01:24:31.665 --> 01:24:33.111
Fuck you!

01:24:43.045 --> 01:24:47.575
- Come on, baby. Yeah. Come on.
- It's not... I'm not there. I'm sorry.

01:24:47.725 --> 01:24:50.135
- Yeah, you can do this, right?
- I know.

01:24:50.285 --> 01:24:52.535
Come on. Come on!

01:24:52.685 --> 01:24:56.155
Fuck me please.
Are you getting too old, huh?

01:24:56.305 --> 01:24:58.815
Can't get it up? Can't get it up, old man?

01:24:58.965 --> 01:25:01.835
Come on! I need this.

01:25:01.985 --> 01:25:05.234
What is wrong with you? Stop it.

01:25:06.545 --> 01:25:08.794
Fuck you.

01:25:42.345 --> 01:25:44.674
Hi, Chad.

01:25:47.865 --> 01:25:50.094
You like to watch?

01:25:53.965 --> 01:25:55.794
Watch.

01:26:00.325 --> 01:26:02.474
With your own eyes.

01:26:44.965 --> 01:26:48.694
Touch me. Touch me, Chad!

01:27:37.125 --> 01:27:39.754
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

01:27:43.045 --> 01:27:45.094
Chad!

01:27:45.965 --> 01:27:49.005
Oh, my God, he's got a gun.
He's got a gun.

01:27:49.155 --> 01:27:51.495
Chad has a fucking gun.

01:27:51.645 --> 01:27:54.845
Get away from him. Leave him alone!

01:27:54.995 --> 01:27:58.715
- Get away. Put that down!
- Get back! He has a gun!

01:27:58.865 --> 01:28:01.545
He's got a condition, all right?
His nerves get fried.

01:28:01.695 --> 01:28:03.885
She probably freaked him out
and he overloaded.

01:28:04.035 --> 01:28:07.535
He's a fucking pervert.
He's jacking off in my yard.

01:28:07.685 --> 01:28:10.829
- Stop it, you're crazy. Jay, stop it!
- Bullshit.

01:28:11.465 --> 01:28:15.195
You want to just fucking hit me, huh?
You fucking hit me?

01:28:15.345 --> 01:28:19.444
Don't, don't.
Ellis, stop it, you're so crazy.

01:28:30.695 --> 01:28:33.990
Let's take a walk, Chad.

01:29:41.245 --> 01:29:43.755
Everybody's happy.

01:29:43.905 --> 01:29:46.155
Some fucking vacation this was.

01:29:46.305 --> 01:29:49.445
Ellis, what the hell are you doing?
You're scaring the shit out of me.

01:29:49.595 --> 01:29:52.375
We're broke. We got to sell the house.

01:29:52.525 --> 01:29:55.095
We got to sell all of it 'cause I blew it,

01:29:55.245 --> 01:29:59.015
on jewelry and private schools
and antique canoes.

01:29:59.165 --> 01:30:02.275
I blew it all. It's gone.
This is just an illusion.

01:30:02.425 --> 01:30:06.495
- It doesn't even exist anymore.
- Finally! No shit.

01:30:06.645 --> 01:30:09.362
Do you think I'm fucking stupid
that I didn't know?

01:30:09.512 --> 01:30:13.155
Excuse me for giving you
everything you ever wanted.

01:30:13.305 --> 01:30:16.275
I went broke trying to make you happy.

01:30:16.425 --> 01:30:19.795
Do you think any of this shit
makes me happy? Do you?

01:30:19.945 --> 01:30:23.235
Do I look happy? I'm lost, Ellis.

01:30:23.385 --> 01:30:27.135
I am lost in all this bullshit,
in this whole life we built together.

01:30:27.285 --> 01:30:30.334
I don't even know
who the fuck I am anymore.

01:30:40.705 --> 01:30:43.315
- Joey! Joey!
- He's got our daughter. Joey!

01:30:43.465 --> 01:30:46.475
- Joey! Get back here.
- Joey, stop. Joey, stop. Get back here.

01:30:46.625 --> 01:30:49.524
- Come back, what are you doing?
- Chad!

01:30:51.468 --> 01:30:54.110
No, no, no! Come on. Come on.

01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:57.155
Get away from me! Don't touch me.

01:30:57.305 --> 01:31:00.175
Let me go. Chad!

01:31:00.325 --> 01:31:04.114
No! No! No!

01:31:07.265 --> 01:31:09.654
Don't leave me.

01:31:11.759 --> 01:31:14.814
Please. Don't leave me.

01:31:33.765 --> 01:31:36.855
<i>I had a dream. I was as light as a bird.</i>

01:31:37.005 --> 01:31:39.616
<i>A spirit flying through the air...</i>

01:31:40.005 --> 01:31:42.354
<i>and I could see my home...</i>

01:31:42.504 --> 01:31:46.065
<i>and my family. But then I woke up.</i>

01:31:46.765 --> 01:31:49.194
<i>And I was on the ground.</i>

01:31:52.945 --> 01:31:57.405
<i>When you step out of a dream,
things are never what they seem.</i>

01:31:58.305 --> 01:32:01.375
<i>What you thought was real,
wasn't real at all.</i>

01:32:01.525 --> 01:32:04.285
<i>Nothing is as bright or clear...</i>

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:07.174
<i>but the dream is always there.</i>

01:32:07.835 --> 01:32:09.865
<i>And it gives you hope...</i>

01:32:10.015 --> 01:32:12.975
<i>that one day it will return...</i>

01:32:13.125 --> 01:32:15.125
<i>and if you're lucky,</i>

01:32:15.275 --> 01:32:17.874
<i>you'll see your friend again.</i>

01:32:19.225 --> 01:32:21.315
It's so beautiful.

01:32:21.465 --> 01:32:23.294
Yeah.

01:33:26.945 --> 01:33:29.015
<i>Some birds fly alone.</i>

01:33:29.165 --> 01:33:33.585
<i>They're the ones that fly the highest,
can see the most.</i>

01:33:34.385 --> 01:33:38.954
<i>They can fly so high,
that they vanish into thin air.</i>

01:33:42.425 --> 01:33:44.654
<i>Like a dream.</i>

01:33:47.435 --> 01:33:49.664
Don't worry, Mom.

01:33:55.025 --> 01:33:57.614
All the answers are in here.

01:35:30.565 --> 01:35:33.733
<i># I'll see you in my dreams #</i>

01:35:33.883 --> 01:35:37.555
<i># And we'll dance with you holding me #</i>

01:35:37.705 --> 01:35:40.098
<i># But I know #</i>

01:35:40.248 --> 01:35:44.228
<i># Your heart will never be mine #</i>

01:35:46.065 --> 01:35:49.275
<i># Moon shines bright in the sky #</i>
