WEBVTT

00:00.167 --> 00:01.168
Mad cow.

00:01.168 --> 00:02.669
Where do you find prion samples?

00:02.669 --> 00:04.171
In 4 dead people.

00:04.171 --> 00:09.259
These chickens could be carrying a fucking
death sentence for millions of people.

00:09.259 --> 00:11.970
What can we do for those who are potentially
infected?

00:11.970 --> 00:13.472
There is no cure.

00:13.472 --> 00:14.181
Where are you going?

00:14.181 --> 00:15.265
Don't you want me to come in with you?

00:15.265 --> 00:17.559
Go back to your lab, Dad.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.686
- Lilith, moved in.
- Wow.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.563
- What is she like, 14?
- 15.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.190
Tons of attitude!

00:23.190 --> 00:24.274
Hira's replacement.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.693
- Are you still interested in Jill Langston?
- Absolutely.

00:26.693 --> 00:27.861
What do you want me to do about David?

00:27.861 --> 00:30.072
Maybe in Chicago when he's there next
week.

00:30.072 --> 00:31.782
Good morning.

00:31.782 --> 00:35.160
It was said of the Spanish Flu, that you
felt a little ill at breakfast,

00:35.160 --> 00:37.871
went to bed after lunch, and were dead by
dinner.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.874
What would you say if I told you I've got a lead
on the perfect specimen?

00:40.874 --> 00:43.877
Bullshit.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.587
So can I take a couple of days?

00:45.587 --> 00:48.090
I'm playing with this guy
Archambault, 32.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.299
His heart exploded, David.

00:49.299 --> 00:52.386
Instead of injecting something into him
that shouldn't be there,

00:52.386 --> 00:53.679
he gets his body to make it.

00:53.679 --> 00:56.974
So Biriliski and Archambault died
to avoid a patent infringement?

00:56.974 --> 01:00.394
You don't understand. You can't do it
anymore. You will die.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.061
Fuck you, David.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.896
You're a big shot scientist. I'm nobody.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.063
How is he?

01:04.063 --> 01:07.860
Ah.. He's gonna be okay. He's a tough
guy.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.994
1x06- The Trials

02:43.872 --> 02:45.082
And that's about it.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.291
Good.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.501
Ah... one more thing.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.877
Yes. I'm sorry about last week.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.587
I shouldn't have put you on the spot like that.

02:50.587 --> 02:54.591
No. I admire your integrity. Even more than
I appreciate your keeping

02:54.591 --> 02:59.179
Dr. Sandstrom from going public on this prion thing.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.099
Let's just hope we stop this thing soon enough.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.393
Caroline, I need a personal favor.

03:04.393 --> 03:07.688
A colleague of mine, James Bainbridge,
his son Ryan was

03:07.688 --> 03:10.065
diagnosed with leukemia about
six months ago.

03:10.065 --> 03:13.277
They were admitted into a trial for some
new treatment.

03:13.277 --> 03:16.488
I'm not up to speed on it, but
they tell me it was incredibly promising.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.990
Was?

03:17.990 --> 03:19.867
There is some question about it's safety.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.661
And you'd like NorBAC to get involved?

03:22.661 --> 03:25.789
Senator Bainbridge and a lot of sick kids
would.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.500
And.. Jim would see it as a favor.

03:28.500 --> 03:35.966
And he does sit on a Senate's Science and
Tech Committee.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.177
- Garcinia cola.
- That's a plant.

03:38.177 --> 03:40.179
Comes from the same place where ebola lived.

03:40.179 --> 03:41.263
Never heard of it.

03:41.263 --> 03:44.183
A big deal at the
International Botanical Congress.

03:44.183 --> 03:46.685
Traditional African medicine.
Poison antidote.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.061
And it works on Zaire Ebola?

03:48.061 --> 03:50.272
It works on any strain from what I've read.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.064
It's amazing.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.693
It's a dimeric flamanoid, and if it stops
Ebola replication in its tracks...

03:54.693 --> 03:56.486
You think it's worth throwing at the Miranda Virus?

03:56.486 --> 03:59.781
Why not? You got the DNA sequences back
from the dental floss yet?

03:59.781 --> 04:01.283
Bob should have it this afternoon.

04:01.283 --> 04:02.367
Where is Bob?

04:02.367 --> 04:04.578
- He's waiting for us at the hoop.
- Aw, you didn't tell him.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.871
What am I suppose to say, David?

04:05.871 --> 04:08.290
Oh Bob, you're too good,
you can't play basketball with us?

04:08.290 --> 04:09.291
Yes.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.585
Where are you going?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.295
Wait. What meeting?

04:13.295 --> 04:15.589
- Left a message on your machine.
- I didn't check it.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.464
Of course.

04:16.464 --> 04:20.761
We've been asked to mediate in the dispute
between two researchers in a clinical trial.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.471
- David!
- I don't do bureaucratic bullshit.

04:22.471 --> 04:27.476
This bureaucratic bullshit has a US senator
attached, who will help give your bank financed and

04:27.476 --> 04:29.269
give you every new toy you want.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.395
Who's running the trial?

04:30.395 --> 04:33.982
- Julius Booker at the University..
- Is this about the new gene therapy treatment

04:33.982 --> 04:35.567
for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)?

04:35.567 --> 04:36.068
You know about it?

04:36.068 --> 04:37.986
I heard they got shutdown, what happened?

04:37.986 --> 04:41.281
- One of his test patients died.
- Well, that hurts, but people with

04:41.281 --> 04:43.867
leukemia do die. Why'd they pull the plug?

04:43.867 --> 04:46.578
One of his lead researchers,
Lauren Folley, claims that.

04:46.578 --> 04:49.081
- Lauren Folley?
- You know her?

04:49.081 --> 04:52.584
Let me get my coat.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.967
Hello, Robert.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.385
Miss Richmond.

05:01.385 --> 05:02.594
Why don't you get in?

05:02.594 --> 05:04.471
All right.

05:04.471 --> 05:08.183
Robert, why don't you come around to the front?

05:08.183 --> 05:10.394
All right.

05:19.069 --> 05:22.990
Robert, you're not doing anything wrong.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.367
I feel like I am. I always have.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.579
Robert, we've had this arrangement for over
a year now.

05:28.579 --> 05:31.081
I know I know. It's just..

05:31.081 --> 05:33.292
I don't know what they'll say if they found out.

05:33.292 --> 05:38.964
Well, let's make sure they don't find out.

05:42.885 --> 05:46.972
And the paperwork?

05:46.972 --> 05:49.266
Thank you, Robert.

05:49.266 --> 05:55.397
Thank you, Miss Richmond.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.366
Come in.

06:06.366 --> 06:10.078
Dr. Folick, Caroline Morrison, NorBAC.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.581
Lauren, please.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.167
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.503
David.

06:17.503 --> 06:19.087
Long time.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.465
Lauren.

06:21.465 --> 06:23.800
Ahh... We were biology undergrads together.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.595
- Back in the dark ages.
- Very dark. Very dark.

06:26.595 --> 06:29.890
- So I guess we've been invited to the party.
- Yeah. I'm glad.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.100
I feel like I'm out there all alone.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.269
- Come in. Sit.
- Thank you.

06:34.269 --> 06:37.481
So, Lauren you think this is a questionable
treatment?

06:37.481 --> 06:40.692
Not questionable.

06:40.692 --> 06:43.195
Maxwell Peterson was 11 years old.

06:43.195 --> 06:45.572
He was a wonderful, bright boy.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.699
He was diagnosed with leukemia a year ago.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.785
Do you got any proof that the therapy caused
the stroke?

06:49.785 --> 06:52.287
Well, he died just 4 hours after receiving the
treatment.

06:52.287 --> 06:55.791
No, I meant scientific proof. You know hard
numbers, data, that kind of thing.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.085
No. Not yet.

06:58.085 --> 07:02.798
So you just jumped to the conclusion that
the kid died from the injection.

07:02.798 --> 07:06.593
Gene therapy is about injecting a virus.
A good virus.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.179
It goes right into the cancer cells and kills them.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.764
- A "Magic Bullet."
- I see.

07:10.764 --> 07:14.101
I think that the Peterson boy's system over responded.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.894
Maybe the dosage was wrong...

07:15.894 --> 07:18.188
- Maybe it was the timing...
- But you don't know..

07:18.188 --> 07:20.274
Neither does Booker.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.484
You brought this up with the internal review board?

07:22.484 --> 07:25.487
Yeah, I asked them if they could believe if this was
just a coincidence.

07:25.487 --> 07:30.868
Well, did you ask them if it was just a coincidence
that the other two patients got better?

07:30.868 --> 07:34.788
Look, David. The point is Booker just wants to plow
ahead.

07:34.788 --> 07:38.083
And write this stroke off as a normal occurrence
in an AML patient.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.001
Well, he's not wrong.

07:39.001 --> 07:42.087
Is this something that the chief scientist on the
project should just ignore?

07:42.087 --> 07:44.381
Why would he do that?

07:44.381 --> 07:47.593
The university's job is to keep money flowing
into research.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.469
And Booker is a money magnet.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.470
Someone's got to do it.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.181
Come on, David.

07:52.181 --> 07:55.475
Cancer treatment is a 20 billion dollar a year
business.

07:55.475 --> 07:59.188
If Appliex is the first to market this gene
therapy they are going to make a fortune.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.190
Appliex Pharmaceuticals?

08:01.190 --> 08:02.900
Yeah.

08:02.900 --> 08:06.278
Wow. You're butting heads with a hell of a
pharmaceutical company.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.780
Yeah, well. They've had their failures.

08:08.780 --> 08:11.200
Give me a drug medic that hasn't.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.201
Look.

08:12.201 --> 08:16.663
I just think that we need to step back and
ask ourselves some hard questions.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.583
I see. So instead of working with Booker, you
just decided to go over

08:19.583 --> 08:24.171
his head and blow the whistle on him.

08:25.297 --> 08:26.298
You haven't changed a bit.

08:26.298 --> 08:31.595
I'd say you haven't either.

08:31.595 --> 08:35.265
- My data. Keep an open mind.
- I will.

08:35.265 --> 08:38.101
- Very nice to meet.
- Nice to meet you.

08:46.485 --> 08:49.780
I wouldn't be surprised if this is her
"Best of Celine" collection.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.365
What's the matter with you?

08:51.365 --> 08:53.492
I hate Celine Dion.

08:53.492 --> 08:54.701
What's wrong?

08:54.701 --> 08:58.288
Folley. She's so textbook.
She's got no imagination.

08:58.288 --> 09:02.793
She just gets on the tracks... one direction.
One conclusion, one answer.

09:02.793 --> 09:06.171
Had been that way since the day I met her.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.464
What?

09:07.464 --> 09:10.884
You two had a thing, didn't you?

09:10.884 --> 09:17.266
- Where did that come from?
- Did you?

09:17.266 --> 09:20.978
You know how it is in university, I mean, everybody's
sleeping with everybody else..

09:20.978 --> 09:22.771
You were sleeping with everybody else?

09:22.771 --> 09:25.983
No. Not everybody.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.693
Oh come one you trying to tell me you didn't
sleep around?

09:27.693 --> 09:29.778
I don't see that's any of your business.

09:29.778 --> 09:32.281
- Well you're judging me.
- Yeah, just like you're judging Lauren Folley

09:32.281 --> 09:38.495
- As a scientist. A bad scientist.
- Can you be objective?

09:38.495 --> 09:41.373
Yes.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.805
- Hey.
-  Have you been waiting long or what?

09:56.805 --> 09:58.265
No really, no.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.601
So what do you want to do?

10:00.601 --> 10:02.186
I don't know.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.271
That.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.564
Looks like fun.

10:05.564 --> 10:10.068
Mick, skaters are losers.

10:10.068 --> 10:13.989
Didn't know that.

10:13.989 --> 10:17.201
So uhh.. what's the coolest thing you've
ever done?

10:17.201 --> 10:19.995
Wow. That's a huge question.

10:19.995 --> 10:20.871
Like anything.

10:20.871 --> 10:26.293
Like uh.. Seen, done or whatever.
Doesn't matter.

10:26.293 --> 10:30.380
I saw a corn-snake eat a mouse. Like just
whole.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.674
Come on you can do better than that.

10:32.674 --> 10:36.303
- Okay, I shaved off all my hair.
- Yeah. Why?

10:36.303 --> 10:38.388
Because I was bored. I don't know.

10:38.388 --> 10:41.391
Oh I know, a whale.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.477
A whale winked at me.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.269
What do you mean?

10:44.269 --> 10:47.898
We went whale watching and we were
on the boat and this huge whale,

10:47.898 --> 10:52.569
like totally humongous, comes up and it was this
far away, I swear,

10:52.569 --> 10:56.073
it just came out of the water
looked at me and I swear to you, it winked.

10:56.073 --> 10:58.492
It winked at me.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.285
Man.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.995
I want that.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.288
What?

11:03.288 --> 11:05.082
I want a whale to wink at me.

11:05.082 --> 11:06.500
- A whale?
- Yeah.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.795
- Um.. Where are you gonna find a whale?
- The ocean.

11:09.795 --> 11:11.505
Whatever, we'll find it.

11:11.505 --> 11:15.801
24 trials of my career and this is the most
promising treatment I've ever worked on.

11:15.801 --> 11:18.178
- Is it the safest?
- The whole point of the trial is to

11:18.178 --> 11:20.806
find out if it's safe, but I can't believe
Folley's allegations.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.976
You know we're looking at fast-track
designation with the FDA on this?

11:23.976 --> 11:26.186
Do you think Folley is way off base here?

11:26.186 --> 11:30.190
Well, she's jumping the gun making decisions
based on emotions, not science.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.483
Wouldn't be the first time.

11:31.483 --> 11:34.069
A child did die in the trial.

11:34.069 --> 11:40.200
The boy was sick. He died of a disease
that we were trying to save him from.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.370
You see cancer cells, they multiply at
an extremely high rate.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.790
We deliver a simple cold virus that makes an
RNAi.

11:46.790 --> 11:52.087
RNAi, it's a new method for eliminating proteins
like AML-6.

11:52.087 --> 11:56.300
And the RNAi kills the mutant protein in the cell,
and cell growth is arrested.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.177
We're tricking them into
committing mass suicide.

11:58.177 --> 12:01.180
- Apoptosis. Wow.
- Exactly.

12:01.180 --> 12:05.601
The RNAI is encoded with an EBV derived
plasma under a poll 3 expression.

12:05.601 --> 12:08.395
Now the plasma is targeted
to the tumor cells and a viral vector

12:08.395 --> 12:11.190
harboring a humanized anti-CD33 binding
protein.

12:11.190 --> 12:14.276
Because CD33 is highly expressed in AML cells.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.194
That's it.

12:15.194 --> 12:17.070
See it's a triple barrel approach.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.866
We attack the specific molecular defect in an AML
cell, we induce apoptosis and

12:20.866 --> 12:25.370
we can even insure higher specificity by using
the CD33 binding protein.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.206
It's amazing.

12:27.206 --> 12:30.167
Because of one death, this treatment is
going nowhere?

12:30.167 --> 12:31.585
See why I'm so...

12:31.585 --> 12:32.878
Pissed off?

12:32.878 --> 12:35.088
Yeah.

12:35.088 --> 12:39.676
I like a man who's not afriad of being a
rude, pompous, arrogant, asshole.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.596
That's why we get along so well.

12:42.596 --> 12:46.266
Caroline, what Booker is working on in there
is leading edge science.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.268
Folley was one of his senior scientist.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.687
She's over interpreting based on one
observation.

12:50.687 --> 12:55.067
Okay, do me a favor. Explain to me what he
was talking about in there?

12:55.067 --> 12:57.402
- And don't gloat.
- Okay.

12:57.402 --> 13:01.198
If I had two samples of the same virus,

13:01.198 --> 13:05.869
and I put them ideal condition, right? Turn the lights
down low, put on a little Barry White

13:05.869 --> 13:07.788
- I got it.
- I'd never get a third virus,

13:07.788 --> 13:09.790
because viruses don't reproduce that way.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.167
- Thy're asexual.
- Ah you've been doing a little reading eh?

13:12.167 --> 13:13.585
Go on.

13:13.585 --> 13:18.006
So in order for a virus to reproduce
they've evolved this neat little tricks

13:18.006 --> 13:23.887
of breaking into a host cell, killing the boss,
taking over,

13:23.887 --> 13:25.097
"Okay, you guys are working for me now."

13:25.097 --> 13:27.891
Pretty soon you got all these nasty little
viruses out there and

13:27.891 --> 13:28.767
the neighborhood's shot to hell.

13:28.767 --> 13:29.893
Okay.

13:29.893 --> 13:34.189
Okay, so in gene therapy, you take a virus
and you alter it, right.

13:34.189 --> 13:38.193
You remove all the nasty bits and replace
them

13:38.193 --> 13:40.070
with something good.

13:40.070 --> 13:43.782
And now you've got the best delivery
system mother nature has to offer.

13:43.782 --> 13:48.787
Because if you inject a few trillion of
these nicely altered little viruses into

13:48.787 --> 13:52.666
a patient, the viruses will just do what comes
naturally, and they will break into

13:52.666 --> 13:55.878
- the patient's cell..
- And kind of infect them with health?

13:55.878 --> 13:58.297
- Pretty amazing, eh?
- Yeah. It is.

13:58.297 --> 14:00.007
Yeah?

14:00.007 --> 14:01.800
Hello.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.969
I can barely hear you.

14:03.969 --> 14:07.389
Oh Joe. Yeah, yeah.

14:07.389 --> 14:08.974
Are you sure?

14:08.974 --> 14:11.393
Fucking sure is good enough for me.
I'm on my way.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.270
I'll call you with my details.

14:13.270 --> 14:16.106
On your way where?

14:16.106 --> 14:17.900
You know, I gotta. Here you.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.568
You go ahead. I'll catch a cab.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.778
- Everything okay?
- Oh yeah, yeah, fine. Fine ahh.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.781
Make sure Carlos gets those and have him
start on the evaluation.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.201
- You're not gonna handle this?
- What's wrong with Carlos?

14:27.201 --> 14:28.869
- Nothing, but..
- I love it when you agree.

14:28.869 --> 14:31.079
Where are you going?

14:31.079 --> 14:34.583
- Nunavut.
- Nunavut? That's like way up there.

14:34.583 --> 14:36.376
Yeah, permafrost catchy.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.085
And you're doing this why?

14:37.085 --> 14:40.380
Because I've been chasing this Spanish
Flu ever since I was your age.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.381
Why?

14:41.381 --> 14:44.885
Because it killed more people than any
other virus known to human kind.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.887
Right, and that's something that excites
you.

14:46.887 --> 14:51.099
Yeah! Something that you can't see with the naked
eye and wipes out an entire civilization.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.184
It's the bomb man.

14:52.184 --> 14:54.102
Eww... So, when are you gonna be back?

14:54.102 --> 14:56.772
Ahh... I don't know. Depends on the flight,
which depends on the weather.

14:56.772 --> 14:59.900
And this is very important for your trip?

14:59.900 --> 15:01.902
I don't know why it got in there.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.071
- You're so weird.
- Okay so, listen.

15:04.071 --> 15:08.700
This is for food, and you know whatever
else you might need it for.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.369
You gonna be okay on your own?

15:10.369 --> 15:12.996
- I've been my own for half my life.
- Nice.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.207
It's not a slam, it was a reassuring observation.

15:15.207 --> 15:17.292
Ah well, thank you then. Okay.

15:17.292 --> 15:19.670
I will see you. I will call you.

15:19.670 --> 15:22.673
If Mick... you know, he had a dream too,

15:22.673 --> 15:23.674
he should like, totally go for it.

15:23.674 --> 15:25.968
- Absolutely.
- And I should help him.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.177
- Of course.
- Yeah, okay.

15:27.177 --> 15:30.305
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:39.398 --> 15:40.691
Mick, hey hey.

15:40.691 --> 15:42.192
Hey, you ready?

15:42.192 --> 15:45.070
Got a magic card.

16:16.602 --> 16:19.396
You drive like a madman.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.690
I didn't see any traffic signs.

16:21.690 --> 16:22.691
Is this it?

16:22.691 --> 16:24.985
That's why it took over a year to find it.

16:24.985 --> 16:28.071
Church record said it would be out here
somewhere.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.782
I found the dog tags
right over here.

16:30.782 --> 16:36.079
This here is your Mr. George Edward Plane.

16:36.079 --> 16:43.670
In the permafrost since 1918.

16:45.506 --> 16:49.384
What are you doing? It smells good.

16:50.302 --> 16:53.180
Oh. Bob, I read your report.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.307
No doubt in your mind?

16:55.307 --> 16:57.184
Bob!

16:57.184 --> 17:00.103
Oh, Good night.

17:00.103 --> 17:03.982
The dental floss DNA, 100% certain it's him?

17:03.982 --> 17:07.277
It only takes 10 DNA matches to convict
a man to criminal case.

17:07.277 --> 17:12.907
I've given you 20. Zansinger is Martin Jamieson,
the biological father of Daisy Markowitz's baby.

17:12.907 --> 17:15.577
I guess we should be grateful
for a terrorist who flosses.

17:15.577 --> 17:18.288
I'm greatful for anyone who flosses.

17:18.288 --> 17:22.376
Um, have we started reviewing the AML
trials?

17:22.376 --> 17:25.295
David on top of it?

17:25.295 --> 17:28.006
We don't know where he is, do we?

17:28.006 --> 17:30.884
- He probably does.
- Yeah.

17:30.884 --> 17:34.805
Good night, Bob.

17:41.270 --> 17:42.187
Need some help?

17:42.187 --> 17:45.107
No, I'm okay.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.609
What the hell is that?

17:47.609 --> 17:49.903
It's his coffin.

17:59.705 --> 18:01.999
Should I be wearing one of those?

18:01.999 --> 18:03.375
Oh, no. Just ah..

18:03.375 --> 18:06.503
Stand back a little bit there Joe.

18:10.007 --> 18:12.509
So you done this before?

18:12.509 --> 18:14.970
In The old days med students had to find
their own corpses,

18:14.970 --> 18:17.472
so we're just part of a grand old tradition.

18:17.472 --> 18:19.808
Grave robbing?

18:22.978 --> 18:25.189
Oh, you're fucking beautiful.

18:26.106 --> 18:29.902
You are one sick seal.

18:36.783 --> 18:40.495
Polar bears can smell that guy from
100 kilometers.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.005
Come on.

19:32.005 --> 19:35.509
Help me put everything back.

19:35.509 --> 19:37.886
And I mean everything.

19:52.192 --> 19:55.195
So...

19:55.195 --> 19:57.990
So, now I do some ITPCR

19:57.990 --> 20:00.993
and some sequencing to see
how degraded the RNA is.

20:00.993 --> 20:02.703
So, how about my money?

20:02.703 --> 20:04.580
Oh.

20:04.580 --> 20:09.084
Sorry, man.

20:11.503 --> 20:12.880
And...

20:12.880 --> 20:15.883
Joe, I tell you, if this works out.
I'm gonna get you ten times this.

20:15.883 --> 20:18.802
I won't hold my breath.

20:18.802 --> 20:21.096
You keep this between ourselves, right?

20:21.096 --> 20:25.392
Your dead guy will talk before I will.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.187
Actually, I'm hoping he'll tell us plenty.

20:28.187 --> 20:31.273
Your ride's here, Dav.

20:31.273 --> 20:33.400
Okay.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.110
It was a pleasure doing business with you.

20:35.110 --> 20:38.697
You got any more frozen bodies, you know
where to find me.

20:38.697 --> 20:41.200
I got what I need.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.011
So what did you tell your dad?

21:01.011 --> 21:02.304
The truth.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.181
You told him the truth and you're still
alive?

21:04.181 --> 21:07.309
- Yeah. Well, I left a note.
- Oh, great.

21:07.309 --> 21:12.189
It's not that I'm going to lie.
What I'm doing is not wrong.

21:12.189 --> 21:14.775
Just checking...

21:14.775 --> 21:17.194
Mick, those are a lot of pills.

21:18.779 --> 21:21.490
Mick, Mick. Maybe this wasn't a great idea.
I, I..

21:21.490 --> 21:24.076
It is. It is.

21:24.076 --> 21:26.578
Amazing idea.

21:26.578 --> 21:27.579
Okay?

21:33.001 --> 21:37.089
Hi honey. I'm home.

21:37.589 --> 21:43.470
Lilith?

21:55.399 --> 21:56.692
Hey dad. Um..

21:56.692 --> 21:58.902
Did you find that virus? Okay now.

21:58.902 --> 22:02.489
Don't freak. Mick and I went off to look at
whales. So..

22:02.489 --> 22:05.200
Okay bye.

22:05.200 --> 22:08.287
It's Lauren. I wanted to talk to you
about the other day.

22:08.287 --> 22:10.080
My cell is 41..

22:10.080 --> 22:11.874
Hi David. Caroline asked me where you were
today.

22:11.874 --> 22:13.876
Of course I didn't say anything.

22:13.876 --> 22:15.586
Mainly because I'm not really sure where you
are.

22:15.586 --> 22:19.381
If you want to call me and tell me where you
are so I can tell Caroline., that would be really great.

22:19.381 --> 22:24.303
And I hope you're having a fun time
wherever you are.

22:24.303 --> 22:25.804
Hi.

22:25.804 --> 22:27.306
Hi.

22:27.306 --> 22:29.391
- I called.
- Yeah. I just ah...

22:29.391 --> 22:33.187
I literally just walked in the door.

22:33.187 --> 22:34.897
Look, ahh, David.

22:34.897 --> 22:38.775
I know that you think of me as that
knee jerk grad student

22:38.775 --> 22:40.485
and that you don't have a lot
of respect.

22:40.485 --> 22:43.071
Do you want to come in?

22:43.071 --> 22:44.281
No.

22:44.281 --> 22:48.410
And I want you to know that I'm not
the same person that I was back then.

22:48.410 --> 22:53.207
So you're not gonna spend the night?

22:54.082 --> 22:55.501
I just. I ah..

22:55.501 --> 22:59.671
I truly believe that Dr. Booker is making a
mistake by not stopping

22:59.671 --> 23:01.173
and looking at the data on his gene trial.

23:01.173 --> 23:04.510
Yeah you made that pretty clear the other day.

23:05.093 --> 23:08.388
I want to work with you to make sure that
these are safe. Or..

23:08.388 --> 23:12.100
- Sure you don't want to come in for a glass of wine or?
- No.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.603
Just look at the data.

23:14.603 --> 23:16.605
And run every test that you can.

23:16.605 --> 23:19.483
You might be saving a life.

23:19.483 --> 23:22.486
- Thanks for listening to me.
- Sure.

23:30.994 --> 23:33.789
- Albert Einstein, right?
- Ah..

23:33.789 --> 23:36.208
No actually "Mork from Ork".

23:36.208 --> 23:37.709
Oh.

23:37.709 --> 23:40.504
I get those two mixed up all the time.

23:40.504 --> 23:43.507
- Mayko Tran, I'm over in Informatics.
- Jill Langston, virology.

23:43.507 --> 23:45.300
- I know. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

23:45.300 --> 23:46.885
So you had the tour? Pretty awesome, huh?

23:46.885 --> 23:49.888
Yeah, it's incredible.

23:51.306 --> 23:52.683
Is that lunch?

23:52.683 --> 23:53.475
Sort of.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.185
Rabbit food.

23:55.185 --> 23:57.604
- Come on. I'll show you where the fridge is.
- Okay.

23:57.604 --> 24:00.983
- So you're hooked up with David in Chicago.
- He interviewed me there, yeah.

24:00.983 --> 24:02.109
Did he behave himself?

24:02.109 --> 24:03.902
- I don't know what ask..
- It's okay.

24:03.902 --> 24:05.404
That's why we love him.

24:05.404 --> 24:08.782
Hello David. How is ah..

24:08.782 --> 24:10.909
Where were you?

24:10.909 --> 24:11.702
Whose shit is this?

24:11.702 --> 24:13.912
Oh. The new virologist. She's already made
herself home.

24:13.912 --> 24:15.581
What new virologist?

24:15.581 --> 24:16.707
Oh shit.

24:16.707 --> 24:18.500
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.293
What's she doing here?

24:19.293 --> 24:20.794
- You hired her.
- I did?

24:20.794 --> 24:22.379
I'm confused.

24:22.379 --> 24:24.298
Hello David.

24:24.298 --> 24:25.674
This is Jill Langston.

24:25.674 --> 24:26.300
I know.

24:26.300 --> 24:31.096
- She say that MIT, Stanford, Princeton..
- Not now Bob.

24:31.096 --> 24:33.182
What are you, ahh?

24:33.182 --> 24:36.602
I mean. Can I ahh...

24:37.811 --> 24:39.479
- In my office right away.
- Sure.

24:39.479 --> 24:41.899
So no one told you I accepted the offer.

24:41.899 --> 24:43.108
I was out of town.

24:43.108 --> 24:45.194
- I hope it was a pleasant surprise.
- No.

24:45.194 --> 24:47.779
I mean, I mean. Yes it was. It It was just..
I thought.

24:47.779 --> 24:49.990
- Hi Caroline.
- Hi.

24:50.407 --> 24:52.201
- So you got Jill, eh?
- Yeah.

24:52.201 --> 24:54.786
- You're settling in?
- Yeah. Yeah. Everything's great.

24:54.786 --> 24:55.913
Find an apartment?

24:55.913 --> 24:58.582
- I got a lead on a couple.
- Good. Good.

24:58.582 --> 25:03.003
Jill was one of my early consultants when
NorBAC was going through committee.

25:03.003 --> 25:03.795
Really?

25:03.795 --> 25:06.381
I didn't want to prejudice you until you two
had a chance to meet,

25:06.381 --> 25:07.674
but I'm happy it all worked out.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.010
- Yeah. Here she is.
- Yeah.

25:11.887 --> 25:14.473
So I was just gonna take Jill into my office.

25:14.473 --> 25:16.391
Get her up to speed, that sort of thing.

25:16.391 --> 25:18.977
- Well, you better get right to it.
- Okay.

25:28.278 --> 25:29.196
Ah..

25:29.196 --> 25:31.490
Isn't that gonna look a little suspicious?

25:31.490 --> 25:31.990
What?

25:31.990 --> 25:33.283
Closing the blinds.

25:33.283 --> 25:33.784
What?

25:33.784 --> 25:35.994
- You're closing the blinds.
- Yeah.

25:35.994 --> 25:37.204
I do it all the time.

25:37.204 --> 25:39.873
When you have a woman in your office?

25:39.873 --> 25:42.209
Yeah.

25:42.209 --> 25:44.503
So.

25:44.503 --> 25:45.796
Is it gonna be okay for you?

25:45.796 --> 25:48.507
- Sure hope so.
- Me too.

25:49.383 --> 25:51.677
Oh shit.

25:51.677 --> 25:53.804
Don't go anywhere.

26:02.688 --> 26:04.106
I found it.

26:04.106 --> 26:06.108
That's a very nice cooler, David.

26:06.108 --> 26:08.902
It's the sample of the 1918 flu.

26:08.902 --> 26:10.279
- Perfect specimen.
- What?

26:10.279 --> 26:12.114
It's impossible.

26:12.114 --> 26:14.283
- Is the RNA intact?
- I don't know yet.

26:14.283 --> 26:17.494
But I got this sample out of the permafrost,
so I'm expecting minimal degradation.

26:17.494 --> 26:19.580
Wait a minute. I am on all of the dig list.

26:19.580 --> 26:23.208
I'm hooked into the Norwegians, I get emails
from Alexcovich in St. Petersburg.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.877
I mean it's....

26:24.877 --> 26:26.086
Where did you get it?

26:26.086 --> 26:27.504
Well, I was a little off the radar.

26:27.504 --> 26:29.298
There's no such thing.

26:29.298 --> 26:30.299
They...

26:30.299 --> 26:33.010
Take months to plan. There's red tape when
you exhume a grave.

26:33.010 --> 26:34.678
I mean what if.. What if the media got a...?

26:34.678 --> 26:38.182
Just be thankful that you never, ever have
to do that again.

26:38.182 --> 26:39.683
Because we got it.

26:39.683 --> 26:41.393
Yeah?

26:42.603 --> 26:44.897
- Sorry. I didn't mean to...
- Oh. That's okay.

26:44.897 --> 26:46.982
- Have you two met?
- We have.

26:46.982 --> 26:47.900
What's up?

26:47.900 --> 26:50.277
I.. Mayko and I need to speak to you about the
trial.

26:50.277 --> 26:51.278
Ah..

26:51.278 --> 26:54.114
Okay, um.. I'll get out of your way.

26:54.114 --> 26:57.910
Oh, and Jill.

26:57.910 --> 27:01.788
- Sequencing and PCRs ASAP.
- Yes doctor.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.707
And uh...

27:03.707 --> 27:05.292
Welcome to the lab.

27:05.292 --> 27:06.502
Thank you.

27:08.212 --> 27:09.713
What do you got?

27:09.713 --> 27:11.298
So..

27:11.298 --> 27:15.802
I did the pathology. Peroxidase stain
showing the cancer cells of

27:15.802 --> 27:19.515
the Peterson boy, one hour after treatment.

27:19.515 --> 27:24.394
Two hours.. Most of the cancer cells are
infected with the virus.

27:24.394 --> 27:27.814
Four hours, the majority of the cancer cells
are dead or dying.

27:27.814 --> 27:30.984
Everything is going great and then..
Stroke and death.

27:30.984 --> 27:33.487
What went wrong?

27:35.280 --> 27:38.492
Okay, so what if the Peterson kid had a
hyper response to the virus?

27:38.492 --> 27:39.910
You've been talking to Lauren Folley?

27:39.910 --> 27:42.204
I looked at her data.
She's not totally out there.

27:42.204 --> 27:44.414
Peterson could have had an allergic reaction
to the virus.

27:44.414 --> 27:47.084
Could have caused the swelling that led to the
stroke.

27:47.084 --> 27:50.712
Proof. Where is your proof?

27:52.589 --> 27:56.385
Look at the Peterson's cytokine profile in the chip
right after injection.

27:56.385 --> 27:58.178
- It's high.
- Could have caused vessel damage.

27:58.178 --> 27:59.179
Could have caused the stroke.

28:00.681 --> 28:02.307
You got a problem with that?

28:02.307 --> 28:03.392
Yeah, the...

28:03.392 --> 28:07.187
Look. All three kids had high cytokine levels.
One is dead.

28:07.187 --> 28:08.897
The other two are in remission.

28:09.481 --> 28:12.484
Okay, so is it the treatment or the disease
that killed the kid?

28:12.484 --> 28:16.905
Maybe the kid's brain was set to go. You know
it's not uncommon in an AML patients.

28:16.905 --> 28:19.199
He might've suffered a stroke with or without
the treatments.

28:19.199 --> 28:20.701
You're willing to bet lives on that Carlos?

28:20.701 --> 28:22.995
The question that we are dealing with here
is..

28:22.995 --> 28:27.583
If 3,000 kids get this treatment,
will 1 die or 1 thousand?

28:27.583 --> 28:29.209
There's no way of knowing at this point.

28:29.209 --> 28:31.712
Well, have you tried running a viral-load
analysis?

28:31.712 --> 28:33.714
Maybe DNA cariotyping the chromosome?

28:33.714 --> 28:35.799
Come on, guys. Get out there. Be a little
creative.

28:35.799 --> 28:37.593
We'll get on it, David.

28:40.888 --> 28:42.681
What?

28:42.681 --> 28:46.810
So uh.. You gonna find time to get involved
with this?

28:46.810 --> 28:47.895
Eventually, why?

28:47.895 --> 28:50.189
Well, you seem somewhere else. You know,
distracted.

28:50.189 --> 28:51.481
I'm fine, Mom.

28:51.481 --> 28:52.399
New girl?

28:52.399 --> 28:56.695
- Mayko, get the fuck out of here.
- Okay, I'm just... checking.

29:05.787 --> 29:08.582
Bob.

29:08.582 --> 29:10.792
Excuse me, Bob.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.002
- Yes, Jill.
- Hi.

29:12.002 --> 29:13.587
Um.. I need some yellow tips.

29:13.587 --> 29:15.797
- Help yourself.
- Oh great. Thank you.

29:15.797 --> 29:17.007
Sure Jill.

29:17.007 --> 29:18.300
What is that?

29:18.300 --> 29:21.178
Oh that's "L'air du temps".

29:21.178 --> 29:23.305
- This is Clive Christian.
- What?

29:23.305 --> 29:24.306
Is that perfume?

29:24.306 --> 29:26.183
- Aren't they beautiful?
- Yeah.

29:26.183 --> 29:27.809
Oh, this is a classic.

29:27.809 --> 29:31.605
- "Evening in Paris".
- Oo la la.

29:31.605 --> 29:34.191
Yep, perfume is the father of organic chemistry.

29:34.191 --> 29:37.402
It's been around since at least the
Babylonians, 4,000 years ago.

29:37.402 --> 29:37.903
Wow.

29:37.903 --> 29:40.906
Yeah, the Egyptians perfected it.
They were the first to use those little

29:40.906 --> 29:45.494
fancy perfume bottles, and Greek women
and men, both wore perfumes.

29:45.494 --> 29:45.994
No kiddin'.

29:45.994 --> 29:49.581
Yeah, they also used it in sacrifices.

29:49.581 --> 29:50.290
Yeah.

29:50.290 --> 29:51.875
Hi.

29:51.875 --> 29:53.585
Hey, how are you doing?

29:53.585 --> 29:56.296
I'm, I'm okay. How are you?

29:56.296 --> 29:58.715
Are you sure you're okay? You sound a
little weird.

29:58.715 --> 30:01.593
Yeah. I'm just on a bus. I don't
want to wake anyone up.

30:01.593 --> 30:03.095
Ah..

30:03.095 --> 30:04.179
Where are you?

30:04.179 --> 30:06.515
I left you a message. We're on our way
to look for whales.

30:06.515 --> 30:08.183
Yeah, what's that all about?

30:08.183 --> 30:11.687
It's just something I have to do.. dad.
Don't worry.

30:11.687 --> 30:14.106
How was your trip?

30:14.106 --> 30:15.607
Good.

30:15.607 --> 30:19.695
Look dad. I guess I'll just.. I'll call you again
to let you know where I am or whatever, okay?

30:19.695 --> 30:21.697
Ah.. Sure. Lilith.

30:21.697 --> 30:24.992
I love you dad. Bye.

30:24.992 --> 30:27.786
I love you dad?

30:31.707 --> 30:35.002
Did you know that there were no Chanel
1, 2, 3, or 4?

30:35.002 --> 30:37.379
5 was just Coco Chanel's lucky number.

30:37.379 --> 30:38.881
Isn't that interesting?

30:38.881 --> 30:40.799
Hey Bob.

30:40.799 --> 30:42.384
Go home.

30:42.384 --> 30:43.594
Oh, okay.

30:43.594 --> 30:44.386
Good night.

30:44.386 --> 30:47.598
- Good night, Jill.
- Good night, Bob.

30:51.602 --> 30:53.896
How you doing?

30:53.896 --> 30:57.691
My stomach's in a bit of a knot, but I'm gonna
finish the first sequence tonight.

30:57.691 --> 30:58.901
Don't you just love the flu.

30:58.901 --> 31:02.112
I bet you say that to all the girls.

31:05.199 --> 31:09.494
- Oh, David. Is this gonna be weird?
- What?

31:09.494 --> 31:11.496
Working together.

31:11.496 --> 31:13.415
No. Absolutely not.

31:13.415 --> 31:16.293
- For you?
- No.

31:16.293 --> 31:18.295
No. It's good.

31:20.714 --> 31:23.008
Still you know...

31:23.008 --> 31:23.800
What?

31:23.800 --> 31:25.677
- I don't know. Nothing, forget it.
- No no no. What?

31:25.677 --> 31:26.803
What are you gonna say?

31:27.596 --> 31:31.683
Well, I mean.. Never has to get weird.

31:31.683 --> 31:32.809
If...

31:32.809 --> 31:34.478
If we uh..

31:34.478 --> 31:35.896
You know from time to time.

31:35.896 --> 31:38.815
How is that gonna make it less awkward at work?

31:38.815 --> 31:42.903
Well, there won't be any of this pent-up
sexual tension between us.

31:42.903 --> 31:45.280
What sexual tension?

31:54.998 --> 31:59.503
Look, David. I'm not the girl who sleeps with
the boss.

31:59.503 --> 32:01.088
Oh.

32:01.088 --> 32:03.590
Okay, you're fired.

32:03.590 --> 32:05.801
You want to come over tonight?

32:05.801 --> 32:07.511
You're very very bad man.

32:07.511 --> 32:11.098
Oh really.. Come on. I consider us
equals. It's not like...

32:11.098 --> 32:14.184
It would be an abuse of my power or anything.
I wouldn't treat you any differently then...

32:14.184 --> 32:15.477
See right there.

32:15.477 --> 32:18.814
That's the problem.

32:19.481 --> 32:24.486
If I'm sleeping with someone I like to be
special to him.

32:24.486 --> 32:27.281
You know, I want to be treated better than...

32:27.281 --> 32:31.493
strangers or... colleagues, random.

32:31.493 --> 32:33.203
Excuse me.

32:33.203 --> 32:36.582
- So you understand?
- Oh yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.

32:36.582 --> 32:39.710
Won't mention it again.

32:40.586 --> 32:44.298
And I'll just be up in my office, if you change
your mind.

32:48.594 --> 32:50.679
Shit.

32:54.308 --> 32:57.811
No, I appreciate the update from you guys.

32:57.811 --> 33:00.314
Yeah, they're still picking the Miranda apart.

33:00.314 --> 33:02.316
It's a tough one.

33:02.316 --> 33:04.610
They'll figure it out.

33:04.610 --> 33:08.280
Keep me posted on what you find out about
Jamieson.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.907
I know you will.

33:09.907 --> 33:12.784
Thanks, Collin. Bye.

33:12.784 --> 33:17.289
Well, now that we've confirmed his identity
MI5's taking the lead on Jamieson.

33:17.289 --> 33:18.415
What have you got?

33:18.415 --> 33:22.085
I don't know, might be nothing but I thought
that I should throw it into the mix.

33:22.085 --> 33:23.712
Booker's stock portfolio?

33:23.712 --> 33:27.508
He's showing a particularly heavy investment
in Appliex Pharmaceuticals.

33:27.508 --> 33:28.592
What made you go there?

33:28.592 --> 33:32.387
Well, you don't like him, and usually have excellent instinct, so...

33:32.387 --> 33:35.516
Is it legal to be testing drug from a company
you own a big piece of?

33:35.516 --> 33:37.893
- Apparently so.
- Interesting. Keep on it.

33:37.893 --> 33:39.102
Let me know what you find.

33:42.606 --> 33:45.817
No, I appreciate the update from you guys.

33:45.817 --> 33:48.779
Yeah, they're still picking the Miranda part.

33:48.779 --> 33:50.405
This way.

33:52.115 --> 33:53.200
Just here.

33:54.993 --> 33:59.581
- David, this is John Ricci.
- Okay.

33:59.581 --> 34:00.999
Thank you, Dr. Sandstrom.

34:00.999 --> 34:03.710
- Thank you for seeing me.
- Oh, no problem.

34:03.710 --> 34:05.796
My wife, she asked me to thank you too.

34:05.796 --> 34:09.882
My pleasure. I'm stil not 100% sure what
it is you want.

34:09.882 --> 34:13.303
- The gene therapy. Is it safe?
- Right.

34:13.303 --> 34:15.681
Mr. Ricci, please have a seat.

34:15.681 --> 34:18.391
And I just need to see you outside for a
minute.

34:18.391 --> 34:20.185
We'll just be a moment.

34:25.399 --> 34:26.692
What is going on?

34:26.692 --> 34:30.904
David, he's called like 10 times. He wants
to talk to you.

34:30.904 --> 34:32.906
Mr. Ricci's kid was turned down for the
trial because

34:32.906 --> 34:34.616
he didn't meet the criteria for the protocol..

34:34.616 --> 34:36.618
- It's not my problem.
- Yes, it is.

34:36.618 --> 34:39.705
You're supposed to be making the calls on this trial,
instead of doing whatever you've been doing.

34:39.705 --> 34:41.790
I've been working on a little bit more important, alright?

34:41.790 --> 34:44.501
Oh, okay. You've got the father of a very sick
boy in there.

34:44.501 --> 34:50.591
He wants to know if you think there's something
out there that might save his kid's life.

34:51.091 --> 34:52.801
First he was getting better, doctor.

34:52.801 --> 34:55.094
He was doing okay with the chemo.

34:55.094 --> 34:58.307
The trial protocol only allowed non-responsive
chemotherapy patients.

34:58.307 --> 34:59.892
Dr. Booker was following protocol.

34:59.892 --> 35:03.478
Yeah, sure. But that was when the trials
first started.

35:03.478 --> 35:05.814
Now, Justin, he is ahh..

35:05.814 --> 35:07.816
He's not doing so good.

35:07.816 --> 35:10.694
What do they call it? The drug ah...

35:10.694 --> 35:12.112
- Drug resistance.
- Yeah.

35:12.112 --> 35:12.988
Yeah, that's it.

35:12.988 --> 35:15.991
Justin, he's saturated with that chemo crap.

35:15.991 --> 35:18.202
It don't work no more.

35:18.994 --> 35:20.913
He's dying, doctor.

35:21.705 --> 35:23.207
Dr. Booker said that...

35:23.207 --> 35:25.709
that you were gonna make the call.

35:25.709 --> 35:31.381
Yeah. Well, Dr. Booker shouldn't have
done that.

35:33.300 --> 35:36.595
There's no miracles out there that I can
see, Mr. Ricci.

35:37.304 --> 35:38.889
- That's bullshit?
- Oh, no.

35:38.889 --> 35:41.308
- I didn't say that.
- Then what are you saying?

35:41.308 --> 35:42.893
You studied the therapy.

35:42.893 --> 35:45.604
- Does it work or doesn't it work?
- We're not sure.

35:45.604 --> 35:48.607
Dr. Sandstrom's going over the data.

35:48.607 --> 35:50.484
- When will you know?
- Soon.

35:50.484 --> 35:51.401
Soon.

35:51.401 --> 35:53.403
This is my number at work.

35:53.403 --> 35:54.613
My number at home

35:54.613 --> 35:56.907
and the cell number, that's my older boy.

35:56.907 --> 35:58.992
Yeah, you call me when you know, okay?

35:58.992 --> 36:00.202
Anytime.

36:00.202 --> 36:03.080
- Day or night.
- I'll call you.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.289
All right.

36:04.289 --> 36:07.000
- My boy, he's not gonna die.
- I'll call you, Mr. Ricci.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.086
I promise.

36:09.086 --> 36:12.214
I'm looking in your eyes.

36:12.214 --> 36:16.218
And I will hold you to that.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.894
Don't ever do that again.

36:25.894 --> 36:28.313
Got you focused, didn't I?

36:34.194 --> 36:36.697
Everything we measured is the same
in all the patients.

36:36.697 --> 36:39.491
Karyotype, viral loads, cytokine levels.

36:39.491 --> 36:41.285
There's nothing to show that the
treatment

36:41.285 --> 36:43.287
triggered the Peterson boy's
stroke.

36:43.287 --> 36:45.080
- And nothing to show it didn't.
- Okay, but..

36:45.080 --> 36:46.999
Look! It shouldn't be that difficult.

36:46.999 --> 36:49.710
The treatment caused two kids to go into
complete remission.

36:49.710 --> 36:51.003
Nobody's saying it didn't.

36:51.003 --> 36:54.506
Look, it's the one death that you're gonna
have to deal with.

36:55.716 --> 36:58.385
So here it is. Make your call.

37:45.390 --> 37:46.808
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:46.808 --> 37:48.685
How did it go?

37:48.685 --> 37:50.979
I'm okaying in the trials.

37:50.979 --> 37:52.606
You don't sound so sure about it.

37:52.606 --> 37:53.607
It's the right call.

37:53.607 --> 37:55.400
It's a hell of a way to fight cancer.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.485
- Gloves.
- Oh yeah.

37:56.485 --> 37:57.903
Hey, you got enough phenol solution?

37:57.903 --> 37:59.696
You want me to get you more phenol
solution?

37:59.696 --> 38:00.405
No, that's okay.

38:00.405 --> 38:02.407
Maybe we should hook him up to the
robotics, you know.

38:02.407 --> 38:04.284
- It might go faster.
- It moves fast enough.

38:04.284 --> 38:05.202
Sure.

38:05.202 --> 38:07.496
- I have better dexterity.
- Exactly.

38:10.207 --> 38:11.500
Go away, David.

38:11.500 --> 38:14.211
I think I might want to sleep next to them all night.

38:14.211 --> 38:15.504
Wow.

38:15.504 --> 38:17.297
That's a good thing I can work under
pressure.

38:17.297 --> 38:21.009
You know, I haven't had a disaster since
the thing in '94.

38:21.009 --> 38:23.220
When you uh.. took out the entire east
wing in the biochem lab?

38:23.220 --> 38:24.304
Yeah, you heard about that?

38:24.304 --> 38:26.390
David.

38:28.308 --> 38:32.187
Do you know about this?

38:32.187 --> 38:35.107
Appliex isn't the only company to have a
trial stopped.

38:35.107 --> 38:37.401
Six people died using that arthritis treatments.

38:37.401 --> 38:38.485
Well, it happens Caroline.

38:38.485 --> 38:40.821
I mean, you test the product
on 5,000 people,

38:40.821 --> 38:42.114
nothing comes up and

38:42.114 --> 38:44.491
then you test it on 500,000 people
suddenly you got some deaths.

38:44.491 --> 38:46.493
Okay, so what if I told you Booker

38:46.493 --> 38:48.287
worked on all three trial phases

38:48.287 --> 38:49.204
for the arthritis treatment?

38:49.204 --> 38:51.290
Tells me he's got lots of experience.

38:51.290 --> 38:53.292
None of this sends up any red flags?

38:53.292 --> 38:55.711
Are you sure you haven't already
decided Booker's the bad guy?

38:55.711 --> 38:56.920
David.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.881
You're pissing on the wrong tree,
Caroline.

38:58.881 --> 39:01.008
I'm gonna put a report on
your desk tonight

39:01.008 --> 39:02.885
saying the trial should continue.

39:02.885 --> 39:04.887
Oh, okay.

39:04.887 --> 39:07.097
- So Folley was wrong?
- No.

39:07.097 --> 39:08.891
I just couldn't prove she was right.

39:08.891 --> 39:10.100
Okay.

39:19.318 --> 39:21.820
- Yes.
- It's Caroline Morrison

39:21.820 --> 39:24.698
Oh, oh. Caroline, hello. How are you?

39:24.698 --> 39:25.991
Good.

39:25.991 --> 39:28.285
I have some news on the leukemia trial.

39:28.285 --> 39:29.995
The senator was asking me about it
just this morning.

39:29.995 --> 39:31.914
What do I tell him?

39:31.914 --> 39:33.916
We're recommending that the trial
resumes.

39:33.916 --> 39:35.000
The treatment's safe?

39:35.000 --> 39:36.710
Well, that's what the trial will tell us.

39:36.710 --> 39:38.921
We found no reason not to continue.

39:38.921 --> 39:40.506
Can we get Jim's son into it?

39:40.506 --> 39:42.007
I've already enquired.

39:42.007 --> 39:45.093
Oh, I can't thank you enough.

39:56.605 --> 39:58.690
Hello, Mr. Ricci.

39:58.690 --> 40:01.318
It's ah.. David Sandstrom calling.

40:01.318 --> 40:02.694
Yes, sir. It was my pleasure.

40:02.694 --> 40:03.987
I have some..

40:03.987 --> 40:05.405
Well, no no. It's...

40:05.405 --> 40:08.283
I'm never too busy to make a phone..

40:08.283 --> 40:10.994
Well, I would like to finish, though, sir.

40:10.994 --> 40:12.996
Thank you.

40:14.081 --> 40:15.582
I found nothing to suggest that the

40:15.582 --> 40:18.710
treatment caused the death of the
Peterson boy.

40:18.710 --> 40:19.586
Yes, that is good news.

40:19.586 --> 40:20.796
However, uh..

40:20.796 --> 40:24.007
To be honest with you I found
nothing to suggest that it didn't, so...

40:24.007 --> 40:25.217
What I'm saying is that

40:25.217 --> 40:26.885
it's a very experimental treatment,

40:26.885 --> 40:30.180
but I am going to recommend that the
trial continue.

40:30.180 --> 40:32.099
That is correct, sir.

40:32.099 --> 40:32.891
Well,

40:32.891 --> 40:34.518
okay. You thank..

40:34.518 --> 40:36.687
You're welcome.

40:36.687 --> 40:37.604
You're...

40:37.604 --> 40:39.314
Mr. Ricci.

40:39.314 --> 40:41.108
Very good, sir. Yes, thank you, sir.

40:41.108 --> 40:42.985
Goodbye.

40:59.501 --> 41:01.587
Lilith.

41:01.587 --> 41:03.297
Hello?

41:03.297 --> 41:05.591
Hello?

41:05.591 --> 41:06.717
Shit.

41:17.102 --> 41:19.396
Come on, Lilith.

41:20.189 --> 41:23.609
Hey, it's Lilith. Leave me a message after
the...

41:46.298 --> 41:49.301
Hey.

41:50.302 --> 41:53.722
What?

42:01.813 --> 42:04.316
What the fuck. What the fuck were you
thinking?

42:04.316 --> 42:05.984
Do you have any idea what you've done?

42:05.984 --> 42:12.115
What kind of shit you're in?

42:28.215 --> 42:30.717
Hey hey.

42:34.096 --> 42:38.016
What?

42:40.310 --> 42:42.604
Oh shit.

42:42.604 --> 42:45.607
Yeah.

42:45.607 --> 42:47.609
All of it?

42:48.318 --> 42:51.989
All eight viral RNA segments,

42:51.989 --> 42:57.911
Hemagglutinin, neuraminidase.
Spanish flu.

42:57.911 --> 42:59.788
We got it, David.

42:59.788 --> 43:01.498
- Intact.
- We got it.

43:01.498 --> 43:03.417
We got it.

43:03.417 --> 43:05.002
We got it!

43:24.104 --> 43:26.815
Excuse me, excuse me.

43:26.815 --> 43:28.483
I love spanish food.

43:28.483 --> 43:30.903
Especially paella. Have you ever had David's paella?

43:30.903 --> 43:33.697
- No, I haven't.
- Oh.. So good.

43:33.697 --> 43:35.115
He told me his secret.

43:35.115 --> 43:39.286
He uses 5 ml. of curcuma, instead of 2.5.

43:39.286 --> 43:42.497
- Wow.
- I know. Shh..

44:13.403 --> 44:15.113
So are you flipping out?

44:15.113 --> 44:17.115
I'm feeling pretty good.

44:17.115 --> 44:19.618
Do you realize that you've

44:19.618 --> 44:23.205
unraveled one of the biggest scientific
mysteries of the last 100 years?

44:23.205 --> 44:25.499
- Yes, I do.
- Good thing you don't have

44:25.499 --> 44:26.792
much of an ego.

44:26.792 --> 44:28.418
It is, isn't it?

44:28.418 --> 44:32.089
Now all you have to do is find a vaccine.

44:43.308 --> 44:45.602
Hello.

44:45.602 --> 44:49.898
Joey, how are you?

44:55.821 --> 44:57.197
Oh my God... What?

44:57.197 --> 45:01.702
What? When did you find out?

45:01.702 --> 45:04.705
Why didn't you tell me?

45:04.705 --> 45:10.794
Well, I would have rather worried than this.

45:10.794 --> 45:13.005
Querido.

45:13.005 --> 45:15.215
Okay, I... I'm on the next flight.

45:15.215 --> 45:18.802
No. I'm, I'm coming.

45:34.401 --> 45:36.111
Lauren, what are you doing here?

45:36.111 --> 45:38.197
You didn't listen.

45:38.197 --> 45:40.324
Oh yeah, look I'm sorry the review
didn't go your way.

45:40.324 --> 45:41.283
Really, I am.

45:41.283 --> 45:43.202
You know, when I heard that you were
doing it.

45:43.202 --> 45:44.703
I thought shit. Well,

45:44.703 --> 45:45.412
at least he's good.

45:45.412 --> 45:47.706
- He'll see.
- Lauren just drink this...

45:47.706 --> 45:48.707
But you didn't,

45:48.707 --> 45:49.708
did you?

45:49.708 --> 45:51.293
We went over this in detail.

45:51.293 --> 45:53.295
The trial should continue.

45:53.295 --> 45:56.798
Even though another child is dying?

45:56.798 --> 46:00.093
Another patient went into blast crisis after
treatment.

46:00.093 --> 46:01.220
Wait wait. Who're you talking about?

46:01.220 --> 46:02.804
He's in a comma, David.

46:02.804 --> 46:04.097
Who?

46:04.097 --> 46:06.600
Justin Ricci!

46:06.600 --> 46:11.522
That child is dying, because of these
fucked up trials!

46:11.522 --> 46:14.900
Trials that you said were safe.

46:14.900 --> 46:17.194
You!

46:17.194 --> 46:19.488
You signed that boy's death sentence.

46:19.488 --> 46:21.490
You!

46:21.490 --> 46:23.700
- Lauren, wait a minute.
- Fuck you, David!

46:23.700 --> 46:25.619
Fuck you!

46:25.619 --> 46:28.205
Lauren.

46:28.205 --> 46:33.418
Lauren, wait a minute. Hang on a second!

46:51.812 --> 46:53.814
David, would you have refused the
chance no

46:53.814 --> 46:56.984
matter how small, how remote
to save a child's life?

46:56.984 --> 46:59.987
Say nothing, nothing happens.

46:59.987 --> 47:05.200
This people, Carlos, they're HIV positive
and they never get AIDS.

47:05.200 --> 47:07.119
You can save me.

47:07.119 --> 47:08.996
Your nose is like, bleeding.

47:08.996 --> 47:09.788
Oh shit! No, it's okay.

47:09.788 --> 47:14.084
It happens all the time.

47:14.084 --> 47:16.211
Look, you want to have a good time?

47:16.211 --> 47:17.796
Okay, but I don't want to talk about this shit.

47:17.796 --> 47:19.506
Please, Iliana. Listen to me.

47:19.506 --> 47:22.509
You have an immunity of sorts. Something I
think you can pass along.

47:22.509 --> 47:25.012
- Don't waste my time.
- You could save a man's life.

47:25.012 --> 47:27.306
You could save many lives. Please.

47:27.306 --> 47:29.224
How are you gonna smuggle a
stem cells into the States?

47:29.224 --> 47:31.393
You're going to hide them into a
tub of butter brickle ice cream?

47:31.393 --> 47:33.395
Cut the bullshit, David.

47:33.395 --> 47:36.190
What the fuck is going on here, Carlos?
