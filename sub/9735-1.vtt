00:52.440 --> 00:54.440
I was born jaundiced.

00:54.520 --> 00:58.200
Once I sat on a toilet seat
at a truck stop and caught hemorrhoids.

00:58.280 --> 01:02.520
I've learned to live with a chicken bone
lodged in my throat for three years.

01:02.600 --> 01:06.480
So I knew dad would be devastated
when he learned my latest affliction.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.960
Dad, I don't want
to upset you...

01:09.040 --> 01:12.960
but my left breast is developing
significantly faster than my right.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.200
It can only mean one thing: Cancer.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.480
I'm dying.

01:19.640 --> 01:22.960
Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise
out of the fridge.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.800
Who's in?
Raise your hand.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.720
Are you coming or not,
Thomas J.?

01:41.760 --> 01:44.040
- I don't think so.
- I knew he wouldn't.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.680
I have to go home.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.440
To play with his dolls.

01:48.520 --> 01:50.200
Leave him alone.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.360
Come on. Let's go.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.920
You didn't pay me.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.320
How do I know
you'll show us one?

02:03.360 --> 02:04.840
You're a baby.

02:04.920 --> 02:08.479
All right. Here.

02:09.720 --> 02:13.000
Follow me
and don't say a word.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.520
You ready?

02:32.880 --> 02:36.520
You sure you want to see it?
Or are you yellow?

02:36.560 --> 02:37.920
I'm not chicken.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.760
Lean forward.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.240
It's empty.

02:46.320 --> 02:49.600
- You're so weird.
- I want my money back.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.160
- I was afraid of this.
- Of what?

02:53.240 --> 02:55.320
Sometimes
when we get them...

02:55.440 --> 02:56.920
they're not
completely dead.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Like when they cut
a chicken's head off...

02:59.080 --> 03:00.960
and they still run around.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.000
You're full of shit.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.000
I bet she's roaming
around this house somewhere.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.800
There she is
in the rocking chair.

03:35.320 --> 03:36.960
Hi, Gramoo.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.480
Vada, would you bring down
my cigarettes?

03:52.280 --> 03:54.000
See you later.

03:55.440 --> 03:59.520
- Did you know he was my wood shop teacher?
- You took wood shop?

04:00.560 --> 04:03.160
I made a tie rack.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.600
- The fluid's mixed?
- Yes.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.480
Put them on the stool.

04:13.400 --> 04:16.560
Guess what?
I beat Thomas J. in Monopoly.

04:16.640 --> 04:19.600
The rack holds six ties.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.079
I still have mine.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.200
- Arthur!
- Vada!

04:23.240 --> 04:26.840
- I beat Thomas J. in Monopoly.
- Good for you.

04:26.920 --> 04:30.280
Once you put hotels on Boardwalk
and Park Place, you're a shoo-in.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.680
- I like to buy railroads.
- We're trying to work.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.640
Cruella De Vil
stole all the puppies.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.080
She was going to make
fur out of them.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.560
Hand me the cannula.

04:51.640 --> 04:55.160
<i>There he was</i>
just-a walkin' down the street

04:55.240 --> 04:57.960
<i>Singin' "doo-wah diddy-diddy</i>
dum-diddy-doo"

04:58.080 --> 04:59.920
<i>Poppin' his fingers</i>
and a-shufflin'...

05:00.000 --> 05:01.880
- Vada!
- Dad?

05:02.760 --> 05:07.360
I'm embalming my high school teacher.
Don't sing.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.160
All right, Arthur.
Slide him to me a little bit.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.080
Let's put him in
a nice model C-501...

05:19.160 --> 05:21.680
bronze stainless
Eternal Journey.

05:21.760 --> 05:24.400
He'll look like a champion.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.480
Is Mr. Harry Sultenfuss in?

05:58.560 --> 05:59.920
Sure. Come on in.

06:11.840 --> 06:15.160
Have you had
the unfortunate experience...

06:15.200 --> 06:17.360
of recently
losing a loved one?

06:19.120 --> 06:21.400
Could I see your dad
for a second?

06:23.080 --> 06:25.840
Dad! Somebody's here!

06:28.840 --> 06:31.360
He's downstairs
working on Mr. Layton.

06:31.400 --> 06:35.480
Prostate cancer. Once it hits
your prostate, you're a goner.

06:40.840 --> 06:42.720
How may I help you?

06:42.760 --> 06:45.080
I'm Shelly DeVoto.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.760
We spoke regarding
the makeup artist job.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.200
- Yes.
- It's still available, I hope?

06:50.280 --> 06:51.920
I think so.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.240
I'm a licensed cosmetologist.

06:55.320 --> 06:59.160
I worked for two years
at the Dino Raphael Salon.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.680
My customers cried
when I said I was leaving.

07:03.840 --> 07:07.200
I have a wonderful disposition.
I put people at ease.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.240
These people
are already at ease.

07:10.720 --> 07:13.920
This is not a beauty parlor.
It's a funeral parlor.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.720
- They're dead?
- They are.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.480
Stiffs?

07:19.560 --> 07:21.320
Deceased.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.080
The ad just said
"makeup artist."

07:24.160 --> 07:26.040
Excuse me a second,
will you?

07:26.120 --> 07:27.960
Sure.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.160
Hi, George.
This is a 1258.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.680
I didn't want
the burnished handles.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.360
- Is that your camper?
- Yes. It is.

07:37.480 --> 07:38.920
That's really cool.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.640
Hello.

07:43.720 --> 07:44.680
She's shy.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.760
Put it back
in the display room.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.440
Daddy, how come
that coffin's so small?

07:56.520 --> 07:59.120
They come in all sizes,
just like shoes.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.320
- Is it for a child?
- Of course not.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.160
Then who's it for?

08:04.200 --> 08:06.480
Short people.
Very short people.

08:06.520 --> 08:10.080
Excuse me.
What about the job?

08:10.160 --> 08:11.640
Pardon?

08:11.720 --> 08:13.480
I need the job.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.800
You still want it?
Even though...

08:15.880 --> 08:18.200
Sure.
It's no big deal.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.040
You see,
all my former clients...

08:20.120 --> 08:21.960
will eventually die...

08:22.040 --> 08:23.960
and all your clients
used to be alive.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.040
So they have something
in common.

08:26.120 --> 08:29.080
You'd do hair and makeup
and answer the phone.

08:32.080 --> 08:35.640
- You've got a deal.
- You can start right away.

08:35.679 --> 08:37.559
Call me Harry.

08:38.520 --> 08:41.200
Is this what
you'd normally...

08:41.280 --> 08:43.240
wear for work?

08:43.360 --> 08:46.080
Don't get me wrong.
I like it.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.320
- But...
- I'll take good care of these people.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.960
They deserve it.
They're dead.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.120
All they've got left
is their looks.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.040
Look at this.
No feet.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.120
Wow.
A real Evel Knievel.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.840
What are you doing in my garage?!

09:27.920 --> 09:30.280
Get out of here!

09:58.120 --> 10:00.480
Hi, Veda.
What's wrong today?

10:00.560 --> 10:02.440
I'm very sick.

10:02.480 --> 10:05.800
Take a seat.
I'll check if the doctor can see you.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.800
Vada's here.
She says she's sick.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.400
She looks all right.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.000
He'll see you.

10:17.080 --> 10:18.960
Why don't you go in?

10:24.840 --> 10:27.880
Well, what is it?
I can handle it.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.560
You're perfectly healthy.

10:29.640 --> 10:32.360
That can't be.
I have the classic symptoms.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.360
Did they bring
Mr. Layton to your house?

10:35.440 --> 10:37.600
- Yes.
- You've got to stop this.

10:37.640 --> 10:41.040
There's absolutely
nothing wrong with you.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.200
I'll just have to get
a second opinion.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.960
What did he say
is wrong with you?

10:59.040 --> 11:01.720
The whole medical profession
is a crock.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.000
Wait up for me!

11:19.960 --> 11:21.920
- Look!
- At what?

11:22.000 --> 11:24.360
That's Mr. Bixler.
Let's go talk to him.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.760
I don't want to talk
to no teacher.

11:27.960 --> 11:31.360
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss
and the amazing Dr. J.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.280
- How's your summer?
- Okay.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.840
Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books
for summer reading.

11:36.920 --> 11:40.080
Really? Already?
The summer's just begun.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.320
Yes. Now I'm reading
"War and Peace" for fun.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.800
No wonder
you're my prize pupil.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.920
- What about you, Thomas J.?
- I haven't started.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.160
Get on his case, Vada.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.920
How come you're painting
this house?

11:52.000 --> 11:55.800
Well, I just bought it.
Now I'm fixing it up.

11:55.920 --> 11:58.240
This is one big house
for one single person.

11:58.240 --> 12:01.600
Well, you never can tell.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.520
I might get a pet.

12:05.680 --> 12:09.360
How are you going to pay
for this house if you're not working?

12:09.440 --> 12:12.400
I'm going to teach
creative writing.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.440
- I'm doing some work.
- How much does it cost?

12:15.520 --> 12:18.040
- Thirty-five dollars.
- What do you get for that?

12:18.120 --> 12:21.400
Me. Two hours a week
talking about poetry.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.360
Is this an interrogation, Vada?

12:23.400 --> 12:25.200
No.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.880
Well, I guess I'll go home
and finish off "War and Peace."

12:28.000 --> 12:31.400
It's summer.
You're kids. Go play.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.480
Want to go to Gray's Orchard
and pick some peaches?

12:40.520 --> 12:42.280
No. I'm going home.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.120
Why? It's not dinner time yet.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.520
You're like a dog.
You just go home to eat.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.040
Don't pee on the hydrant!

13:08.360 --> 13:10.760
<i>Bill</i>

13:10.840 --> 13:15.640
<i>I love you so</i>
I always will

13:15.720 --> 13:19.120
<i>I look at you</i>
and see the passion

13:19.200 --> 13:22.400
<i>Eyes of May</i>

13:22.440 --> 13:26.280
<i>Oh, but am I ever</i>
gonna see

13:26.360 --> 13:29.640
<i>My wedding day</i>

13:31.240 --> 13:33.680
Trooper Gwynn called.
There was a big accident.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.120
They're bringing
in two tomorrow.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.520
Excuse me.
I finished Mr. Layton's hair.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.280
He kind of looked...

13:39.360 --> 13:41.920
- What's wrong with her?
- She's pretending.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.800
Get up and eat your broccoli.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.800
I think it's my prostate.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.520
Something like
a" Sky Lounge? ''

13:49.600 --> 13:51.120
How many removals...?

13:51.200 --> 13:55.360
<i>I got rhythm</i>
I got music

13:55.400 --> 13:59.280
<i>I got my man</i>
Who could ask for anything more

14:00.320 --> 14:02.520
<i>I got daisies</i>

14:02.640 --> 14:04.480
<i>In green pastures</i>

14:04.560 --> 14:06.400
I had a body
in my bedroom.

14:06.480 --> 14:09.680
<i>I got my man</i>
Who could ask for anything more

14:18.080 --> 14:20.080
- Who's winning?
- I am.

14:21.240 --> 14:23.560
Look!
Vada and her little boyfriend.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.480
He's not my boyfriend.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.800
I bet she kisses him
on the lips.

14:27.880 --> 14:32.120
- You think I'd kiss that ugly thing?
- Yeah, anyway.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.640
Come on. Let's go.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.640
Judy's father
owns the Bijou theater.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.600
We see all the movies
we want for free.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.360
- Maybe you can come sometime?
- Don't invite her.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.760
She'll bring her boyfriend.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.880
<i>Vada and Thomas</i>

14:45.960 --> 14:47.680
<i>Sittin' in a tree</i>

14:47.720 --> 14:51.440
<i>K-I-S-S-I-N-G</i>

14:51.520 --> 14:55.200
<i>First comes love</i>
Then comes marriage

14:55.280 --> 15:00.000
<i>Then comes Thomas J.</i>
in the baby carriage

15:00.040 --> 15:01.280
You know...

15:01.360 --> 15:03.080
don't let them upset you.

15:03.160 --> 15:06.800
I'm not upset.
I would never play with them.

15:06.920 --> 15:10.480
I surround myself with people
I find intellectually stimulating.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.360
Want a piece of chocolate?

15:19.400 --> 15:21.520
- I'm allergic to it.
- To chocolate?

15:21.600 --> 15:24.080
- He's allergic to everything.
- Chocolate?

15:24.160 --> 15:26.600
To everything.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.440
That's a pretty ring.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.920
It's a mood ring.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.720
- It tells my mood.
- It doesn't work.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.640
- It's always black.
- Only when you're around.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.760
You put me
in a bad mood.

15:38.840 --> 15:40.760
Maybe black
means you're happy.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.040
I don't think so.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.360
Shelly,
how can I get $35?

15:45.440 --> 15:48.360
She's crazy. She wants to go
to school over the summer.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.840
It's not a real school.
A writing class.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.760
I want to be a writer.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.160
Her sweetie pie's
the teacher.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.360
Shut your
big, fat mouth!

15:57.440 --> 15:59.840
I think you'd make
a fine writer.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.760
Did you ask your dad?

16:01.800 --> 16:03.280
He won't give it to me.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.320
You don't know that.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.720
Ask him.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.120
<i>Edith, what channel</i>
is Cronkite on?

16:11.200 --> 16:13.280
<i>Channel two, Archie.</i>

16:13.360 --> 16:15.280
<i>The one we don't watch</i>
because you always say...

16:15.360 --> 16:17.960
<i>Walter Cronkite</i>
is a communist.

16:26.120 --> 16:27.920
<i>I never said that, Edith.</i>

16:28.000 --> 16:29.800
<i>The man ain't all red.</i>

16:31.720 --> 16:33.680
<i>What's wrong with this?</i>
Nothing's coming on.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.600
<i>I'll help you, Daddy.</i>

16:35.680 --> 16:38.720
Daddy, can I have $35?

16:38.800 --> 16:40.520
That's a lot
for a little girl.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.160
It's for school.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.000
A summer writing class.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.600
Any more soda left?

16:49.160 --> 16:51.840
Shelly thinks I'd be
a good writer.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.320
Last month you wanted to play violin.

16:54.400 --> 16:57.560
Then you wanted to be
a ventriloquist.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.000
Dad?

16:59.080 --> 17:01.200
I love this guy.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.599
- Dad
- What?

17:04.680 --> 17:06.520
The money?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.359
Maybe next summer.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.000
<i>He forgot about the time</i>
I wanted to be a magician.

17:14.079 --> 17:17.200
<i>I was really great</i>
at making myself disappear.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.560
Want to play?

17:23.599 --> 17:25.680
No, I've got to go
to a cemetery.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.040
Keep your head up.

17:28.119 --> 17:30.400
Don't look at the ball,
look at me.

17:31.440 --> 17:34.000
See? You were lookin'
at the ball.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.120
All right?
Keep your head up.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.760
Gimme some skin.

18:33.760 --> 18:35.600
Please!
Open the door, please!

18:35.680 --> 18:38.160
Someone open the door!
Please!

18:38.200 --> 18:40.320
Please, open the door!

18:41.840 --> 18:44.040
<i>There he was just-a walkin'</i>
down the street

18:44.080 --> 18:46.920
<i>Singin' "doo-wah diddy-diddy</i>
dum-diddy-doo"

18:46.960 --> 18:49.520
<i>Poppin' his fingers</i>
and shuffling his feet

18:51.600 --> 18:53.440
What happened?

18:54.880 --> 18:57.320
My ball.
I lost my ball.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.760
Come on.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.200
Excuse me?

19:08.880 --> 19:10.960
Could you take a look
at Mrs. Porter?

19:19.760 --> 19:22.640
Didn't I give you
a picture of her?

19:28.800 --> 19:30.360
You don't like it?

19:30.440 --> 19:33.080
This was
the Reverend Porter's wife.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.840
You have her looking
like a two-dollar hooker.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.920
I think she looks nice.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.480
Her lips are very thin.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.960
I used the gloss
to give them a sensual quality.

19:43.040 --> 19:46.760
And her eyes
just needed a little definition.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.960
And her hair...
Nobody wears this hairdo in 1972.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.280
She did.

19:51.360 --> 19:54.200
This photo was taken a month ago
at the church food drive.

19:54.280 --> 19:57.120
I wanted to get past
the schoolmarm image.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.560
That wasn't an image.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.800
She was an old schoolmarm.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.560
Fix it.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.160
I was just wondering...

20:14.200 --> 20:16.120
if there is anything wrong
with Vada?

20:16.160 --> 20:17.520
What do you mean?

20:17.600 --> 20:19.920
- The other night...
- Oh, that. She likes to play.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.520
I don't think so.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.760
I think she's confused
about death.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.920
She was raised in a funeral home.
She knows a little about it.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.400
I really think...

20:29.440 --> 20:31.840
She's a happy
eleven-year-old girl.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.360
Look...

20:33.400 --> 20:37.280
don't give me any advice
about my daughter, okay?

20:40.240 --> 20:43.520
<i>Late last night</i>
Not the night before

20:43.560 --> 20:46.200
<i>Twenty-four robbers</i>
came a- knockin' at my door

20:46.240 --> 20:48.440
<i>As I went out</i>
To let them in

20:48.520 --> 20:51.480
<i>This is what they told me</i>
And this is what they said

20:51.560 --> 20:53.600
<i>Patty-cake, patty- cake</i>
Turn around

20:53.680 --> 20:55.640
There's Shelly!

20:58.960 --> 21:01.600
Can we look around
in your camper?

21:01.680 --> 21:04.960
Sure. I'll give you
the royal tour.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.760
This is the coolest thing.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.560
You can really
eat and sleep here?

21:21.400 --> 21:23.240
I'm going to drive us
to Liverpool.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.080
Big Ringo fan.

21:27.440 --> 21:29.560
- Would you like a soda?
- I would.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.200
- Thomas?
- Yes, please.

21:36.760 --> 21:37.960
What are you reading?

21:41.680 --> 21:44.280
You shouldn't be looking at that.
It's too old for you.

21:44.360 --> 21:46.520
Did you read
all these books?

21:46.600 --> 21:47.960
What are they about?

21:49.080 --> 21:51.600
Mostly love
and romance.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.560
Gross.

21:54.640 --> 21:57.240
They're just fun to read.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.720
Here. Cheers.

22:03.480 --> 22:04.920
Are you married?

22:05.040 --> 22:07.080
No. I'm divorced.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.440
Daddy says it's bad
when people get divorced.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.480
I know.
Sometimes married people find out...

22:11.560 --> 22:13.440
they can't live
with each other.

22:13.480 --> 22:15.040
The Meyers are divorced.

22:17.320 --> 22:19.280
Can I have a cookie?

22:21.520 --> 22:23.000
Where are the cookies?

22:24.520 --> 22:27.440
Well, I guess you found
my secret hiding place.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.360
What are you saving for?

22:30.400 --> 22:32.440
Nothing in particular.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.160
Just for a rainy day.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.840
I'm supposed to be home
at noon for lunch.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.160
Thanks.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.000
Bye.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.920
Well.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.920
- Let's head back.
- Can I use your bathroom?

22:49.000 --> 22:50.560
- Sure.
- You don't have to wait.

22:50.640 --> 22:52.480
Daddy will be mad
if you're late.

23:02.640 --> 23:07.960
"The great way is not difficult
for those with no preferences.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.520
With the absence
of both love and hate...

23:10.640 --> 23:14.160
everything becomes clear
and undisguised."

23:15.720 --> 23:18.600
That was written by a Chinese
philosopher in the year 600.

23:18.680 --> 23:22.320
Why would I bring that up
in a creative writing class?

23:23.880 --> 23:25.240
Because...

23:25.320 --> 23:29.240
the absence of judgement
helps us to appreciate reality.

23:29.280 --> 23:33.320
In other words, I want you to listen
to your classmates' writing...

23:33.400 --> 23:36.560
with a clear
and open heart.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.400
So, who's first?

23:40.520 --> 23:41.880
I got one.

23:47.320 --> 23:49.880
"I sang a song
for you to hear.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.360
I painted a picture
for you to see.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.800
I picked a rose
for you to smell.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.520
I planted grass
for you to touch.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.600
But you did not
hear my song.

23:59.680 --> 24:02.320
You did not see
my picture.

24:02.400 --> 24:06.400
You did not smell my rose,
and you did not touch my grass."

24:06.480 --> 24:08.560
Maybe she was
out of town?

24:08.640 --> 24:10.400
That's not funny.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.240
His poem is about futility.

24:12.320 --> 24:16.120
We toil
in unrewarded obscurity.

24:16.160 --> 24:17.480
I hear judgment.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.600
Let's not forget
the part about the open heart.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.840
Is there something
I can do for you?

24:23.880 --> 24:25.640
I paid the money.

24:26.640 --> 24:27.760
For this class?

24:29.280 --> 24:31.160
I want to be a writer.

24:32.880 --> 24:37.240
But, Vada, this is
an adult writing class.

24:37.320 --> 24:41.720
I think it's beautiful.
She wants to be a writer.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.400
More power to you,
little sister.

24:45.640 --> 24:47.360
You sure you want
to do this?

24:49.360 --> 24:51.560
Welcome to the class.

24:51.640 --> 24:54.120
Go find a seat.

24:59.480 --> 25:01.840
Who's next?

25:01.880 --> 25:04.240
I experienced something
with my boyfriend the other day...

25:04.320 --> 25:06.160
and I wrote
a few words down.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.760
The floor is yours, Ronda.

25:11.480 --> 25:14.280
"He covers me
like a blanket...

25:14.360 --> 25:17.880
from the cold,
dark night.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.320
As I look into his eyes,
I know it's right.

25:22.400 --> 25:25.920
To touch.
To feel.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.360
I know he's real.

25:28.400 --> 25:32.120
Flesh all a-mesh.

25:35.080 --> 25:37.160
I can't fight it.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.560
There's no point.

25:39.600 --> 25:42.920
I wake up
and light a joint."

25:55.520 --> 25:57.240
I wrote a poem, too.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.480
Please.

26:00.520 --> 26:03.240
"Ode to Ice Cream,"
by Vada Sultenfuss.

26:03.320 --> 26:06.440
"I like ice cream a whole lot.
It tastes good when days are hot.

26:06.520 --> 26:09.640
On a cone or in a dish,
this would be my only wish.

26:09.720 --> 26:14.160
Vanilla, chocolate, rocky road,
even with pie a la mode.''

26:14.240 --> 26:16.200
That's all I got so far.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.080
I hear that.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.400
"Flesh all a-mesh"
or "rocky road."

26:21.480 --> 26:23.560
It's about desire.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.960
It's very sweet
and it rhymes.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.480
That's also good, but...

26:31.040 --> 26:34.400
you're not expressing to me
what's in your soul.

26:34.480 --> 26:37.360
I want you to show me
how you see the world.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.400
Your fears,
your desires.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.800
Your innermost secrets.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.240
<i>My fears and secrets.</i>

26:45.320 --> 26:48.040
<i>I'm afraid</i>
I killed my mother.

27:19.960 --> 27:22.200
<i>Cannot do without</i>

27:22.320 --> 27:25.200
<i>Harry's wild about me</i>

27:26.280 --> 27:28.160
Excuse me, Harry.
I'm sorry.

27:28.240 --> 27:32.000
The flowers were delivered,
and the room's all set up.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.080
Thanks.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.640
Listen, I want to apologize...

27:35.720 --> 27:37.560
for the other day
about Vada.

27:37.640 --> 27:38.640
I was harsh.

27:38.720 --> 27:42.200
I shouldn't stick my nose
in other peoples' business.

27:42.280 --> 27:44.120
It's just that
I like Vada very much.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.840
After my wife died,
Gramoo moved in here...

27:47.920 --> 27:50.720
to help us
take care of Vada.

27:50.760 --> 27:52.480
They were very close.

27:52.600 --> 27:56.040
But lately, as her mind's
been wandering more and more...

27:56.160 --> 27:58.200
Vada's been acting
kind of crazy.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.160
I'm sure she'll
snap out of it, though.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.720
I'm sure she will.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.400
Nothing's biting today.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.160
Maybe they had
a big breakfast.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.480
I'm going to be an acrobat
when I grow up.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.800
Big deal. I can do that.
You got something.

28:20.840 --> 28:21.960
Hurry!

28:23.000 --> 28:24.440
I'm trying.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.360
Reel it in.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.040
It's a sunny.
Throw it back.

28:38.120 --> 28:40.080
I don't like
touching fish.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.880
I'll pull the hook out
without touching it.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.440
You're hurting it.

28:50.800 --> 28:54.400
Darn hook! I'm bleeding.
Did he get away?

28:54.440 --> 28:56.080
Go look.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.760
He got away.
Come on. Let's go.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.800
We can become blood brothers.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.520
I don't want to.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.440
You could pick
that scab on your arm.

29:06.520 --> 29:08.000
It's a mosquito bite.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.800
It'll bleed.

29:09.840 --> 29:12.120
If I do it,
can we go?

29:17.160 --> 29:19.320
Rub them together.

29:23.360 --> 29:24.880
We're blood brothers
for life.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.880
Hi. What can I do
for you?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.080
Nothing.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.120
I was just wondering
what you were doing.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.840
I'm just typing up
a funeral notice.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.280
When someone dies,
we put one in the paper.

29:52.320 --> 29:55.200
It's a service
we provide for the family.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.920
Right.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.080
"Bader, Lorenzo.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.320
Died June 22, 1972.

30:04.440 --> 30:07.480
Devoted husband to Nicolette.

30:07.520 --> 30:11.560
Cherished father
of Fabrizio and Heidi.

30:11.640 --> 30:15.680
In lieu of flowers, please send
donations to the Holy Name Society."

30:15.760 --> 30:18.120
I wrote that.

30:18.160 --> 30:20.040
No kidding?

30:20.080 --> 30:21.920
It's good.
"In lieu of."

30:22.000 --> 30:23.400
I love that word, "lieu."

30:23.440 --> 30:26.880
I prefer it to " instead.''
It has more dignity.

30:26.960 --> 30:29.480
"In lieu." "Instead."

30:29.560 --> 30:30.680
No contest.

30:30.720 --> 30:32.600
It's no big deal.

30:33.960 --> 30:36.440
You have to learn
how to take a compliment.

30:36.520 --> 30:37.680
"Movies.''

30:40.600 --> 30:42.520
"Love Story'' at the drive-in.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.960
Cried my eyes out.
Did you see it?

30:46.120 --> 30:47.960
I haven't been
to the movies in ages.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.880
I love to see movies.

30:49.960 --> 30:52.160
Especially at the drive-in.

30:52.240 --> 30:55.160
I don't think there's anything
more romantic than the drive-in.

30:58.880 --> 31:01.560
I'll let you
get back to work.

31:07.280 --> 31:08.720
I do enjoy
playing bingo.

31:08.840 --> 31:13.280
If you'd like to join me
tomorrow night, you're welcome to.

31:30.880 --> 31:33.720
- Are you going out somewhere?
- Nope.

31:33.800 --> 31:37.600
- Why put on lipstick?
- A girl's always gotta look her best.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.560
I think lipstick
looks fake.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.880
No one's lips
are that color.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.360
Have you ever tried any?

31:43.440 --> 31:44.440
No.

31:44.560 --> 31:46.520
Come here.
Sit down.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.480
Go like this.

31:58.560 --> 32:00.200
Little less.

32:04.480 --> 32:05.640
All right.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.840
Now first we blot.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.120
Take a look.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.840
It looks nice on you.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.720
Do you think I'm pretty?

32:21.800 --> 32:25.000
Yes.
I think you're very pretty.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.160
You've got these
great, big...

32:27.240 --> 32:29.400
sparkling eyes.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.480
Cutest little nose.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.160
An amazing mouth.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.880
Boys at school
don't think I am.

32:36.920 --> 32:38.360
They'll come around.

32:38.440 --> 32:40.520
Close your eyes.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.960
I want to bring out
the gorgeous color in them.

32:44.320 --> 32:48.040
Now the first rule
in applying eye makeup...

32:48.080 --> 32:51.320
is you can never wear
enough blue eye shadow.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.840
Do you like putting makeup
on people?

32:55.600 --> 32:57.440
I've been trying to get
to Hollywood...

32:57.520 --> 33:00.600
to do makeup
for the movie stars, but...

33:00.640 --> 33:02.880
I haven't gotten there yet.

33:06.720 --> 33:09.720
All right.
Open your eyes.

33:14.280 --> 33:18.240
I would definitely hold off
on that Hollywood thing.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.000
- Your lip bleeding?
- No.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.960
What's wrong
with your eyes?

33:35.040 --> 33:37.080
A girl can never wear
enough eye shadow.

33:37.160 --> 33:38.800
Where's your bike?

33:38.880 --> 33:40.800
In the garage.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.640
Walk me over.

33:46.680 --> 33:49.240
It's only a garage.
Come on.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.520
One of my streamers is gone.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.520
It probably fell off
in here.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.680
Look at this.

33:59.760 --> 34:01.440
That was Gramoo's.

34:01.520 --> 34:03.040
It's a phrenology chart.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.280
They used to study
bumps on your head...

34:05.360 --> 34:08.159
to see if you had
a good personality.

34:08.239 --> 34:11.320
- I'll diagnose your head.
- I don't wanna.

34:11.400 --> 34:14.280
Come on.
It's fun.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.400
- Interesting.
- What?

34:24.480 --> 34:26.320
You have no personality.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.960
- Where does it say that?
- Never mind.

34:31.560 --> 34:33.600
Is that your dad?

34:35.520 --> 34:37.400
Who's that with your dad?

34:43.239 --> 34:45.120
That's my mother.

34:45.199 --> 34:47.719
- Do you remember her?
- No.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.000
Gramoo said she's in heaven.

34:50.080 --> 34:52.000
What do you think it's like?

34:52.120 --> 34:53.840
- What?
- Heaven.

34:54.880 --> 34:59.520
I think everybody gets
their own white horse.

34:59.600 --> 35:03.360
All they do is ride
and eat marshmallows all day.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.160
And everybody's best friends
with everybody else.

35:07.360 --> 35:10.200
When you play sports,
there's no teams...

35:10.280 --> 35:12.160
so nobody gets picked last.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.800
But what if you're afraid
to ride horses?

35:14.880 --> 35:19.160
It doesn't matter
They're not regular horses.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.520
They got wings.

35:21.640 --> 35:24.520
And it's no big deal
if you fall.

35:24.640 --> 35:27.120
You just land in a cloud.

35:27.240 --> 35:29.400
That doesn't sound so bad.
Come on.

35:29.480 --> 35:31.640
We're gonna find
that streamer.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.720
Well. What's going on in here?

35:50.800 --> 35:52.040
Nothing.

35:52.120 --> 35:53.520
I'm dressing.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.960
You're dressing.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.080
Don't you know
it's not nice to lie...

36:00.200 --> 36:01.800
to your big brother?

36:03.080 --> 36:05.240
- Watch the hair! The shirt!
- Give!

36:05.280 --> 36:07.120
All right!

36:08.680 --> 36:10.120
I'm going out with Shelly.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.680
Yes! That's great.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.360
- I'm very nervous.
- Why?

36:17.400 --> 36:19.840
The last date I had
was 20 years ago.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.160
True.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.080
Sit down.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.600
Let me fill you in
on today's woman.

36:28.640 --> 36:31.520
Since the last time you dated,
something happened.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.120
The sexual revolution.

36:33.920 --> 36:36.760
Before, you had to hold a door
for a woman...

36:36.840 --> 36:39.240
pull her chair out,
pick up the check.

36:39.320 --> 36:40.760
No more.

36:40.840 --> 36:43.680
You know what else is missing?
Bras.

36:44.560 --> 36:47.360
- Oh, come on.
- I'm serious.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.240
Trust me, Harry.

36:49.280 --> 36:51.560
This women's lib thing is in.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.960
You gotta treat her
like every Tom, Dick and Harry.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.600
Are you sure?

36:55.680 --> 36:58.520
Did you not tell Vada
I'm a womanizer?

36:58.640 --> 37:00.320
I'm running late.

37:02.080 --> 37:04.920
- Shelly will be here any minute.
- She's picking you up?

37:04.960 --> 37:06.680
You're on
the right track.

37:06.760 --> 37:10.360
She's just driving over.
We're taking my car.

37:12.120 --> 37:13.160
How do I look?

37:14.200 --> 37:16.400
Like a Sultenfuss.

37:18.320 --> 37:19.840
Go get her.

37:22.280 --> 37:23.800
'Night.

37:25.640 --> 37:28.120
Why are you dressed up
to play bingo?

37:28.200 --> 37:29.720
I want to look nice.

37:29.800 --> 37:31.520
You never cared before.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.440
Shelly's coming.
We're going together.

37:34.480 --> 37:37.440
- Why?
- She likes to play bingo.

37:37.560 --> 37:38.960
Can I go too?

37:39.080 --> 37:41.720
No. You'd better
stay and keep Gramoo company.

38:22.760 --> 38:25.120
<i>I've got to admit,</i>
I'd as soon...

38:25.200 --> 38:28.960
<i>not have any more bounty prisoners</i>
coming through Dodge any time soon.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.120
<i>It's a bit wearin'</i>
on the nerves.

38:31.200 --> 38:35.320
<i>This day was starting off just fine,</i>
and I'm gonna keep it that way.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.880
<i>Doc, you never</i>
answered my question.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.480
- Where are you?
- Here.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.600
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

38:51.680 --> 38:52.960
What do you want?

38:53.000 --> 38:56.640
My mom will skin me
if she finds me out here.

38:56.680 --> 38:58.840
Let's go to the church.
They're playing bingo.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.760
I told you,
I'll get in trouble.

39:00.840 --> 39:03.480
- Pacifist
- Am not.

39:03.560 --> 39:06.760
- Bed wetter.
- I stopped that.

39:08.320 --> 39:09.920
N-38.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.440
Under the " N''...

39:11.560 --> 39:14.120
Don't laugh.
There's a strategy to bingo.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.720
For instance, on a given night,
anybody can win.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.080
I play the odds.

39:18.160 --> 39:20.040
When choosing bingo cards...

39:20.080 --> 39:24.160
I use the laws of probabilities
to avoid duplicate number systems.

39:24.240 --> 39:25.720
You get much more activity.

39:25.800 --> 39:28.560
Does it make it easier
to win?

39:28.640 --> 39:32.240
No. Just more activity.

39:32.320 --> 39:35.520
<i>l- 1 7.</i>
Under the "I," 1- 7.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.520
Hi, Carl, Vern.

39:38.240 --> 39:40.760
They won't let us in.
We're kids.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.400
We're not going to bet.
We're just going to watch.

39:43.480 --> 39:46.160
Watch bingo?
I don't even like to play.

39:46.240 --> 39:47.600
Duck.

39:48.680 --> 39:51.960
<i>N- 4-2.</i>

39:52.040 --> 39:54.400
<i>Under the "N," 4-2.</i>

39:54.480 --> 39:56.040
Great!

39:56.080 --> 39:57.600
There's your dad
and Shelly!

39:57.680 --> 39:59.880
I don't want them
to see me.

39:59.960 --> 40:02.400
3-7.

40:05.960 --> 40:10.160
<i>B- 4.</i>
Under the "B," 4.

40:13.680 --> 40:18.440
<i>O- 69.</i>
Under the "O," 6-9.

40:18.520 --> 40:21.360
- I just had a terrible thought.
- What's that?

40:21.440 --> 40:26.360
I'm going to be putting makeup
on some of these people soon.

40:26.440 --> 40:29.280
Why do you think
these seats were empty?

40:31.000 --> 40:32.360
B-6.

40:32.400 --> 40:34.360
Under the "B," 6.

40:34.440 --> 40:36.480
- Can we go yet?
- Go!

40:36.560 --> 40:39.840
I'm not allowed
out by myself after dark.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.840
I'm just not lucky.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.680
It's not always luck.

40:46.760 --> 40:48.160
Depending upon the numbers...

40:48.280 --> 40:51.240
a guy with ten cards can win
as easily as a guy with a hundred.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Kind of like men.

40:54.080 --> 40:56.480
How do you mean?

40:56.520 --> 40:59.200
You can be in a room
with 100 men...

40:59.280 --> 41:01.880
and not like any of them.

41:01.920 --> 41:05.400
Or you can be in a room
with just one man.

41:05.480 --> 41:07.680
He's exactly
the one you want.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.280
Bingo!

41:19.240 --> 41:22.760
We have a winner.
Will the winner raise their hand?

41:22.840 --> 41:25.840
There was no bingo.
It came from outside.

41:25.920 --> 41:28.200
How could someone outside
get a bingo?

41:28.280 --> 41:30.880
Someone outside
didn't get a bingo.

41:30.960 --> 41:34.560
Someone outside yelled "bingo,"
you moron!

41:34.640 --> 41:37.400
- Who are you calling a moron?
- Put a lid on it.

41:38.400 --> 41:42.200
If you weren't 200 years old,
I'd kick your wrinkled ass!

41:42.240 --> 41:43.680
Fellows!

41:43.760 --> 41:45.760
- It's only bingo!
- We can go.

41:45.880 --> 41:50.840
Cards and bad prizes.
A cheap clock, some ugly glassware.

42:37.640 --> 42:39.800
I had a good time tonight.

42:39.880 --> 42:42.920
I haven't had
a bingo partner in ages.

42:46.280 --> 42:50.160
Would you like to see my house?
Just for a minute?

43:04.680 --> 43:06.360
Home sweet home.

43:06.440 --> 43:08.000
It's nice.

43:08.080 --> 43:09.960
I did it myself.

43:10.040 --> 43:13.800
I read a magazine article
about how to maximize small spaces.

43:13.880 --> 43:16.880
Well, it certainly
looks bigger than it seems.

43:17.920 --> 43:20.120
You can look in the bathroom,
if you want.

43:20.200 --> 43:22.120
People are always
curious about that.

43:22.240 --> 43:23.880
Like what happens
when you flush.

43:38.480 --> 43:39.880
Are you mad at me?

43:41.400 --> 43:42.600
No. Why?

43:43.760 --> 43:47.040
I don't know.
You just seemed a little cool.

43:47.080 --> 43:49.720
Not opening car doors...

43:49.760 --> 43:53.040
That was Phil's
advice on dating 70s women.

43:53.160 --> 43:56.240
I'm out of touch.
I haven't dated in ages.

43:56.320 --> 43:58.200
Not since my wife died.

43:59.200 --> 44:00.600
What happened to her?

44:03.960 --> 44:06.200
Complications during childbirth.

44:07.720 --> 44:09.600
She died two days
after Vada was born.

44:11.320 --> 44:13.160
Did she ever see Vada?

44:16.280 --> 44:18.280
I brought the baby
into the room...

44:18.360 --> 44:20.600
a couple of times.

44:20.680 --> 44:23.080
She opened her eyes.

44:24.320 --> 44:26.320
I think she saw Vada.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.560
It was...

44:32.400 --> 44:34.760
Did I ruin this?

44:37.040 --> 44:38.480
Dance with me?

44:38.560 --> 44:40.920
Here?

44:43.480 --> 44:45.600
This is where we are.

44:46.920 --> 44:49.040
Is there enough room?

44:53.080 --> 44:54.880
- I haven't danced...
- In ages.

44:54.960 --> 44:57.320
I know. Me neither.

45:05.880 --> 45:07.120
Bra?

45:08.960 --> 45:12.600
See? You're not that
out of touch.

45:16.840 --> 45:18.200
You're good.

45:19.560 --> 45:22.720
At Woodman High,
I was considered a hot date.

45:22.760 --> 45:25.480
I did a killer Trug.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.360
What are you wearing?

45:32.440 --> 45:33.960
Old Spice.

45:34.080 --> 45:36.560
Phil says
it's a timeless classic.

45:52.720 --> 45:54.360
So do you want to?

45:54.440 --> 45:56.800
Want to what?

45:56.880 --> 45:58.080
Kiss me.

45:58.120 --> 46:00.320
- Yes.
- Good.

46:11.680 --> 46:14.440
Good at kissing
and dancing.

46:14.480 --> 46:17.080
I'm very optimistic.

46:24.800 --> 46:27.400
I'd better go.

46:27.480 --> 46:30.400
It's only a clock.

46:30.480 --> 46:32.600
Good night.

46:38.600 --> 46:40.040
Well.

46:40.160 --> 46:42.600
I guess it's official.
We had a date.

46:42.680 --> 46:44.560
Maybe we can play bingo
again sometime?

46:44.640 --> 46:47.520
I'm tired of bingo.

46:47.600 --> 46:50.400
Maybe we should try
that drive-in of yours.

46:52.320 --> 46:53.720
Good night.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.480
Before class started...

47:15.560 --> 47:19.600
Ronda and Justin wanted to lead
the class in a group meditation.

47:19.680 --> 47:21.920
That's really cool.

47:22.000 --> 47:27.480
What we're going to do is
send our vibes out into the group.

47:31.280 --> 47:33.160
Everybody hold hands...

47:33.240 --> 47:34.560
and close your eyes.

47:36.160 --> 47:40.800
Relax your muscles
and take deep breaths.

47:43.520 --> 47:45.640
Now try to feel...

47:45.720 --> 47:50.080
what the other person is feeling
without speaking any words.

47:51.120 --> 47:53.040
Send out your vibe...

47:53.120 --> 47:56.720
and receive the vibes from around you
at the same time.

47:57.400 --> 47:59.280
Can you feel it?

48:01.480 --> 48:05.160
Open your eyes.
What did everybody feel?

48:05.240 --> 48:08.240
I felt Mrs. Hunsaker's strength.

48:08.280 --> 48:11.400
I can feel that Ronda
is one with the earth.

48:11.520 --> 48:13.720
She's so cosmically in tune.

48:13.800 --> 48:17.760
So right on.
That's exactly what I sent out.

48:17.840 --> 48:20.000
And I felt like you were full...

48:20.080 --> 48:22.160
of inner peace and harmony.

48:23.960 --> 48:26.080
Vada, what did you feel?

48:27.240 --> 48:29.840
- I felt Justin's hangnail.
- No, Vada.

48:29.920 --> 48:32.040
That's not what we're looking for.

48:32.120 --> 48:34.600
A hangnail is insignificant.

48:35.640 --> 48:37.840
What's in my soul...

48:37.920 --> 48:40.160
feel my aura.

48:40.200 --> 48:42.720
I don't think I'm allowed to.

48:43.800 --> 48:46.160
Tell you what.
Let's try it again.

48:47.160 --> 48:49.040
Hold hands.

48:51.360 --> 48:53.720
<i>Gramoo once had a hangnail</i>
on her big toe.

48:53.800 --> 48:56.400
<i>It got infecfed and traveled</i>
to her vocal chords.

48:56.480 --> 48:58.160
<i>Ruined her singing voice.</i>

48:58.240 --> 49:01.560
<i>I don't think Gramoo</i>
thought it was insignificant.

49:56.400 --> 49:58.280
And some lettuce.

50:00.280 --> 50:03.040
Watch out for the rust
when you get lettuce.

50:05.560 --> 50:07.320
I thought I recognized you two.

50:11.280 --> 50:13.160
We're just picking things up
for the barbecue.

50:13.200 --> 50:15.640
Me too.
Mind if I tag along?

50:15.680 --> 50:18.120
Not at all.

50:18.200 --> 50:22.600
- A lot of potatoes.
- It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.

50:22.720 --> 50:25.920
I'm looking forward to that.
Damn it!

50:25.960 --> 50:29.280
- Watch what you're doing!
- Sorry.

50:30.760 --> 50:33.200
This'll be my first July 4th picnic
in a long time.

50:33.280 --> 50:37.320
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes
real bad?

50:37.400 --> 50:40.560
Just put anything you want
in the cart.

50:41.680 --> 50:43.520
I don't know
what's gotten in to her today.

50:44.560 --> 50:47.160
I need olives.

50:47.240 --> 50:49.800
<i>I used to like to play</i>
with my Ken and Barbie dolls.

50:49.920 --> 50:53.240
<i>Ken was my favorite.</i>
Then one Christmas, I got them a camper.

50:53.320 --> 50:55.720
<i>All they wanted to do</i>
was hang out by themselves.

50:55.840 --> 50:59.840
<i>So I wasn't too upset when they took</i>
that wrong turn and went over the cliff.

50:59.920 --> 51:03.680
<i>Gave proof through the night</i>

51:03.760 --> 51:07.600
<i>That our flag was still there</i>

51:07.680 --> 51:12.320
<i>Oh, say does that star-spangled</i>

51:12.400 --> 51:16.800
<i>Banner yet wave</i>

51:42.720 --> 51:45.800
I told you, use fewer briquettes.
Now look what you've done.

51:45.880 --> 51:49.320
- You've cremated them.
- That's what I do.

51:49.400 --> 51:50.960
Do you want to do it?

51:51.040 --> 51:53.880
Why don't you pre-measure the briquettes
in little packages?

51:53.960 --> 51:55.880
Put out a product.
Support me a while.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.640
How's it going, chef?

51:57.720 --> 52:00.560
- I love your apron.
- Thanks.

52:00.680 --> 52:04.120
- Is it ready yet?
- No, sweetie. Not yet.

52:04.160 --> 52:06.600
- When.
- Soon, honey.

52:06.640 --> 52:08.520
- When?
- In a minute.

52:08.600 --> 52:11.400
It's hot. You'll burn your nose.
Look out.

52:17.640 --> 52:20.480
- Just a minute, Mom.
- Dinner!

52:24.680 --> 52:26.080
<i>Rub-a-dub-dub...</i>

52:26.120 --> 52:27.640
thanks for the grub.

52:27.680 --> 52:30.720
- Yea, God.
- I'll second that.

52:30.800 --> 52:32.160
Shelly, like seafood?

52:32.240 --> 52:33.480
Why?

52:33.560 --> 52:35.480
"See food."

52:35.560 --> 52:37.320
That's attractive.

52:39.920 --> 52:42.120
Shit.
Excuse me.

52:45.320 --> 52:48.120
Hey, who lives here?
The Addams family?

52:48.160 --> 52:51.400
- Danny, what are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

52:51.480 --> 52:54.600
Hi, Ralph.
Danny, how'd you find me?

52:54.680 --> 52:58.000
You told everybody where you were going.
I'm here for the motor home.

52:58.120 --> 53:01.000
These two people
do not have a good relationship.

53:01.080 --> 53:03.440
I've been living in it.
The camper is mine!

53:03.560 --> 53:05.920
"Mutual asset."
That's what the lawyer said.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.600
It's supposed to be ours.

53:07.640 --> 53:10.600
- Not Shelly's recreational vehicle.
- Would you keep your voice down!

53:10.680 --> 53:12.520
My boss is watching us.

53:12.600 --> 53:14.800
I'm impressed.

53:14.880 --> 53:18.400
- I guess I have to introduce you now.
- All right.

53:24.880 --> 53:28.040
Vada Sultenfuss?
Tough break.

53:28.120 --> 53:30.240
I like my name.

53:30.360 --> 53:33.800
This is Danny and Ralph. They own
the Dino Raphael Salon in Detroit.

53:34.640 --> 53:36.000
We were married.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.920
Are you here to take her back?

53:38.000 --> 53:43.200
Nice to meet you. We've got burgers
and hot dogs, if you'd care to join us.

53:43.280 --> 53:47.720
- Can't stay. I'm here because my wife...
- Ex!

53:47.760 --> 53:50.880
My ex-wife seems to have ripped off
my camper.

53:51.880 --> 53:54.000
Honestly, he got the Mustang.

53:54.080 --> 53:55.640
- I promise...
- I don't think so.

53:55.720 --> 53:57.920
I've got a copy
of the property settlement here.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.920
Shit! This is my lease.

54:01.040 --> 54:04.000
Damn it. I keep forgetting things.
Getting senile.

54:05.080 --> 54:06.800
What?

54:06.880 --> 54:10.080
I know you've suffered
a terrible loss...

54:10.160 --> 54:12.800
and there's nothing
anyone can do to comfort you.

54:12.880 --> 54:17.240
I urge you to focus on the times
you had with the camper...

54:17.280 --> 54:19.760
the trips you took,
the sights you saw.

54:19.840 --> 54:22.480
Those days are gone, but they'll live on
in your heart forever.

54:23.280 --> 54:24.800
Is he boinking you?

54:24.880 --> 54:28.120
That's a real bonehead thing to say!

54:28.200 --> 54:30.160
You're not gonna take her camper.

54:30.240 --> 54:32.880
- Oh, no?
- It's her home. It's where she lives.

54:32.960 --> 54:35.080
Really? Fine. Go cook.

54:35.160 --> 54:37.080
- Give me the goddamn keys!
- That hurts!

54:40.040 --> 54:41.840
What you do that for?

54:41.920 --> 54:43.920
- Who are you?
- I'm his brother.

54:44.000 --> 54:48.320
- Then you'll be visiting us quite often.
- Why?

54:48.400 --> 54:50.840
Because if he ever tries to take
Shelly's camper again...

54:50.920 --> 54:52.920
I'm gonna bury him in my front yard.

54:57.720 --> 54:59.600
Your father's a savage.

55:01.640 --> 55:03.160
Bye, Ralph.

55:08.640 --> 55:11.640
Well, you were pretty great.

55:11.720 --> 55:13.920
Is it really your camper?

55:23.680 --> 55:27.160
- Can we see them from the back yard?
- You can get the general idea.

55:30.800 --> 55:32.480
There they are.

55:32.560 --> 55:34.840
They always look the same every year.

55:36.200 --> 55:37.640
Look.

55:40.920 --> 55:43.360
Did you love him?

55:47.600 --> 55:50.760
I would never marry anybody
I didn't love.

55:53.080 --> 55:55.080
He must like Shelly.

55:55.120 --> 55:57.840
I never saw him hit anyone in his life.

55:58.880 --> 56:00.880
He likes her.

56:01.880 --> 56:04.400
Does he love her?

56:04.480 --> 56:05.880
Probably.

56:08.280 --> 56:10.440
Do you like her?

56:10.560 --> 56:12.400
Yes, I do.

56:12.480 --> 56:14.960
I think she's very good for your father.

56:15.040 --> 56:16.400
Why?

56:17.480 --> 56:20.360
After your mother died,
he was sad all the time.

56:20.440 --> 56:24.720
But before that,
he was pretty funny.

56:24.800 --> 56:26.200
Really?

56:30.200 --> 56:32.160
Now when I see him with Shelly...

56:33.200 --> 56:35.760
sometimes he seems like
the old Harry.

56:35.840 --> 56:37.680
My dad was funny?

56:39.160 --> 56:43.360
He wasn't one of the Marx Brothers,
but made me laugh.

56:46.400 --> 56:48.360
<i>My uncle fought in the Korean War.</i>

56:48.480 --> 56:50.680
<i>He had a steel plate</i>
put in his head.

56:50.760 --> 56:53.000
<i>Daddy said he didn't come back</i>
the same.

56:53.040 --> 56:57.680
<i>One night, we picked up a radio station</i>
from Oklahoma in his teeth.

56:57.760 --> 56:59.600
<i>It was really neat.</i>

57:05.320 --> 57:07.800
- What?
- Can't you see it?

57:07.880 --> 57:09.880
- No.
- It's there.

57:09.960 --> 57:12.600
There is no chicken bone
stuck in your throat.

57:13.720 --> 57:16.480
Dr. Welty,
are you sure those are yours?

57:18.160 --> 57:20.960
So you fill it with water, like this.

57:21.040 --> 57:23.640
And what have you got?
A water gun.

57:23.720 --> 57:25.760
Cool.
Can I get one for Vada?

57:28.240 --> 57:30.640
Let me ask you a question.

57:30.720 --> 57:33.280
Does Vada tell you
why she comes here so much?

57:33.360 --> 57:35.840
- She's dying.
- Do you think she is?

57:36.920 --> 57:38.600
Why do you think she says that?

57:38.640 --> 57:41.120
She scared of all those dead people
in her house.

57:41.200 --> 57:44.480
You know that saying, " If you can't
beat them, join them''?

57:44.520 --> 57:47.000
If she's one of them,
she won't be as scared.

57:47.080 --> 57:51.360
You know what I think? She's very lucky
to have a friend like you.

57:51.480 --> 57:53.680
She's my best friend.

57:54.720 --> 57:56.600
Miss Vada, how are you feeling?

57:57.640 --> 58:00.040
As good as can be expected.

58:02.160 --> 58:04.080
- Guess what we got?
- What?

58:04.160 --> 58:08.280
- This!
- Hey, you! I'm gonna get you!

58:09.920 --> 58:11.320
Give me that!

58:14.080 --> 58:17.520
- I just got you.
- You didn't.

58:17.640 --> 58:19.840
- Whoa.
- What?

58:19.880 --> 58:22.360
- There's a bee hive.
- So?

58:22.480 --> 58:24.320
Stand back.

58:25.880 --> 58:28.560
Are you crazy?
You'll get stung!

58:28.640 --> 58:30.200
You're right.
Let's knock it down.

58:30.240 --> 58:33.680
- What do you want if for, anyway?
- 'Cause they're neat.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.200
Got it!

58:43.440 --> 58:46.400
My mood ring fell off!
I gotta find it!

58:53.120 --> 58:55.360
They're alive!
Run for your life!

59:08.000 --> 59:11.440
- Run faster! They're after us!
- I am running faster.

59:11.520 --> 59:13.840
- Hurry!
- Jump in the water!

59:13.880 --> 59:16.240
- I have my clothes on!
- Do it!

59:30.720 --> 59:33.320
- Vada, is that you?
- Yes.

59:33.400 --> 59:36.040
Guess what? We're going
to the carnival tonight.

59:36.120 --> 59:38.480
Be ready to go in 10 minutes.

59:38.520 --> 59:41.040
Shelly's coming with us.

59:50.600 --> 59:54.720
- Vada, what's your favorite ride?
- I like the freak show.

59:54.800 --> 59:59.640
I know. Let's go on
the "sit on the bench and rest ride."

59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.760
I don't think that roller coaster
agreed with your dad's stomach.

01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.760
You have to watch what you eat here.

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:07.920
Once I went to a carnival
with my cousins, David and Frank.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.200
They ate hot dogs, and the next day
came down with nephritis.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:15.080
Nephritis is a kidney disease.
You don't get it from hot dogs.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:18.720
All I know is,
the next day they had high fevers...

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:21.160
and their faces got very fat.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.680
It baffled medical science.
They were in a magazine.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:29.680
The were! "Popular Mechanics"...
No, "Popular Science."

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.800
I don't know. It was "Popular."

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:36.440
- They're trying to hit that poor thing!
- Watch you don't knock out a fish.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.400
Just arc it.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.440
I don't know which ball's mine.

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.520
- I won!
- Great!

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.960
We have a winner!
There you go, little girl.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.920
See how easy it is?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.960
That's a gorgeous goldfish.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.120
Where'd you get that ring?

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.680
Did you win it?

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.280
We have something to tell you.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.640
We have some good news.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.680
We're getting married.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.040
My fish!

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.280
We're having the wedding
sometime near the end of the summer.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.760
You'll be okay, little fish.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.480
Should we get you another goldfish?

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.840
No. He's fine.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.520
Fish are very resilient animals.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.000
Don't worry.
I won't get another fish.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.840
The bumper car!

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:57.080
For just 50 cents... a half dollar...
five dimes... ten nickels...

01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.160
we have a ride guaranteed to rearrange
all of your internal organs.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:04.760
Don't pass me by.
That's the bumper car ride!

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.840
Bumper cars! You can't go to a carnival
and not ride them!

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.200
I'd fall asleep at the wheel.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.120
I'll ride them with you.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.040
Great!
Come on.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:20.920
I got the blue one!

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.080
I'm gonna come get you.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.720
Veda, keep your hands on the wheel.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.480
Careful!

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.640
Look out!

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.200
- Can Thomas J. come out?
- Sure. Come in.

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.880
- Wanna ride bikes?
- Sure.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.400
- Did you make your bed?
- Yes.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.600
- You're sure?
- It's made.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:07.920
Come here.
You've got a milk moustache.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.840
Let's go.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.960
- Bye, Mom.
- Have fun, kids.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:23.200
- I'm running away.
- Where are you running to?

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:27.040
California. I'm going to Hollywood
to live with the Brady Bunch.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:30.040
- I wanna live with them too.
- You can't.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.520
They have enough kids. You'll have
to live with the Partridge Family.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:36.320
Really?

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.360
That's it.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.280
- Get up.
- I'm tired of running away.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.880
Besides, we passed this place twice.
We're not getting nowhere.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:16.080
- Why are you running away?
- My dad gave Shelly a ring.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.360
Wow! Was it a decoder ring?

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:22.200
You're such a retard.
It was an engagement ring.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.960
They're getting married?
Now you have a mother.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.640
- I don't like her.
- I do. She's real funny.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.800
He likes her better than me.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:42.200
- I'm hungry. I can't last any longer.
- Then go home, baby.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.640
I have to anyway.
My mom will be worried.

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:47.000
Leave, then.
Some friend you are.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.520
You can come to my house for dinner.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:51.680
No. I'm hiding out.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.880
See you.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.320
<i>Are the gentlemen</i>
going to stay or not?

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:56.200
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:59.040
<i>The whole Circle fortune</i>
goes to you.

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:01.960
<i>- Twenty million dollars.</i>
- I heard you, all right.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.960
<i>That's quite a lot, isn't it?</i>

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:07.680
<i>- It'll do in a pinch.</i>
- I wonder why he left me all that money.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.720
<i>I don't need it.</i>

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:15.880
<i>In school, we learned some people stole</i>
the Lindbergh baby out of his house.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:19.160
<i>I think I'll sleep</i>
with my window open tonight.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.840
Oh, my God!

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.800
Daddy!

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.800
What's the matter?

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.960
- Where's Daddy?
- He just left. What's wrong?

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.320
- I'm hemorrhaging.
- What do you mean?

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.040
I don't want or need your help!

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.800
Did this happen in the bathroom?

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:50.760
- How old are you?
- Eleven and a half.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.600
It's okay.
Come upstairs. We have to talk.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.080
My mommy and daddy did that?

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.520
It's actually a very beautiful thing.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.880
There wouldn't have been a Veda.

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:07.840
I think it should be outlawed.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:10.480
Believe me.
Someday, you'll feel differently.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.400
That's probably Thomas J.
I don't want to see him.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.479
It's not fair.
Nothing happens to boys.

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.880
Hi. Can you come out?

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.359
- I don't know.
- Please!

01:08:28.439 --> 01:08:31.040
It's real hot.
Maybe we can go swimming.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:35.359
No! Get out of here!

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:40.000
And don't come back
for five to seven days!

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.960
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.720
Stay here.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.840
<i>It's quarter to three</i>

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.960
<i>There's no one in the place</i>

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.520
<i>Just you and me</i>

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:09.520
<i>So set them up, Joe</i>

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:13.640
<i>I've got a little story</i>
you ought to know

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.800
<i>We're coming, my friend</i>

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:22.280
<i>- To the end of brief episode</i>
- I'm so sorry.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:26.680
<i>- So make it one for my baby</i>
- All right. It's okay.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:30.600
<i>- And one more for the road</i>
- Very, very sorry.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.480
What were you thinking?

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.480
It's your responsibility to watch her!

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.200
Do you have any idea
how upset those people are in there?

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.240
Why do you think people
want to get married?

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:02.240
When you get older,
you just have to.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.680
I'm going to marry Mr. Bixler.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.480
You can't marry a teacher.
It's against the law.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.600
- It is not.
- Yes, it is.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.600
'Cause then he'll give you all A's,
and it won't be fair.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.600
Not true.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.160
Have you ever kissed anyone?

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.520
Like they do on TV?

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.400
Maybe we should, just to see
what's the big deal.

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.160
I don't know how.

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.160
Here. Practice on your arm,
like this.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.280
Like this?

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.680
Enough practice.
Close your eyes.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.600
Then I won't be able to see anything.

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.720
Just do it.

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.280
On the count of three.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.800
One.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.960
Two.
Two-and-a-half.

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.120
Three.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.080
Say something.
It's too quiet.

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.760
Just hurry!

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:21.120
"I pledge allegiance
to the flag...

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.080
of the United States of America.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.560
And to the republic
for which it stands...

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.600
one nation, under God...

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.840
indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all."

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:54.800
- You better not tell anyone.
- You better not either.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.040
Well, let's spit on it.

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.720
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.800
What?

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:09.560
- Would you think of me?
- For what?

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.520
If you don't marry Mr. Bixler.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.080
I guess.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.080
Get away!

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.040
- What are you doing?
- Feeding my fish.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.040
Is that the fish you won
at the carnival?

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:22.120
He's getting big.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.600
Come here and sit down for a minute.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.600
Something happened to Thomas J.
last night.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.680
He stepped on a beehive.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.960
I told him not to tease those bees.
Did he get stung?

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.920
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.480
No, sweetheart.
You can't.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.000
Why not?

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.400
He was allergic to bees.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.920
He's okay, isn't he?

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.000
There were just too many of them.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.280
What's wrong, sweetheart?

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:39.880
- I can't breath. I'm suffocating.
- Relax. Let me look.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.880
It's okay.
Come up here. Let me have a look.

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:43.800
That's a girl.

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.760
It hurts so bad!

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.080
- Make it stop!
- What hurts?

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.160
The bee stings!
I can't breathe!

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.840
I'm leaving some food by the door
in case you get hungry.

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:32.920
Is Veda home?

01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:37.520
She is. But she's very upset
so she's not seeing anyone.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.600
I'm Judy.
I go to school with her.

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:43.240
I wanted to tell her
I'm sorry about Thomas J.

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.360
Maybe she'll feel better
in a couple days.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.720
Will you tell her I came by?

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:50.960
- Sure.
- Thank you.

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.560
Bye.

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:01.400
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Reverend Moss.

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:05.200
I know the Sennetts want to thank you
for taking care of things so quickly.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.640
I see you took your tray in.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:22.600
Maybe you should come down
for the funeral.

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.680
Sometimes it helps.

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.760
She won't come out.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:39.800
It's been a whole day.

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.880
You have to do something.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.920
- The funeral's starting.
- She's 11 years old!

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.840
Her only friend is dead!

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.840
I know!
What do you want from me?

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.080
Stop hiding!

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.040
You run.

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:02.720
When I came here, the idea of working
with dead people didn't thrill me.

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:06.960
When I saw a family lived here...

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.640
I thought...

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:15.480
if I'm living without a family,
at least I can work with one.

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:18.800
And maybe, once and a while,
be invited for supper.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:22.800
And when those suppers are disrupted
when there's a car crash...

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.720
or a little boy
steps on a beehive...

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:28.600
I'm not asking you to stop feeling
for those people.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:32.920
But life isn't just death.

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.680
Don't ignore the living.

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.240
Especially your daughter.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.880
Excuse me.
The minister's about to begin.

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.560
Thank you, Arthur.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.080
We are here to...

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.400
honor Thomas James Sennett.

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:10.320
He was born May 7, 1961...

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.000
in Madison, Pennsylvania.

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.000
He's survived by his loving parents...

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.920
Charles and Susan Sennett...

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.080
his grandparents,
William and Gloria Sennett...

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.040
and Gerald and Marjory Finn...

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:24.560
and many relatives, friends
and schoolmates.

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:28.720
The internment will follow
at Madison Memorial Park.

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:33.200
The family has asked me
to say a few words before we proceed.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:39.000
No words I could say
would begin to express...

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.320
the loss and grief.

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.760
One word that keeps ringing in my ear...

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:47.280
is "why?"

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:50.200
Why would God choose
to take this little boy from us?

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:54.840
Why? I cant give you an answer
to that question.

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.280
I can tell you...

01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:00.400
God has chosen Thomas J.
for some very special reason.

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:06.640
We must find solace in knowing
that he's in God's care.

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:11.320
In that place,
there is no sorrow or suffering.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.560
The lion lies with the lamb.

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.480
The day is not divided.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:19.480
I'd like to read a passage
from the Bible.

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:23.800
This is Matthew 19.

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.840
At one point, children were
brought to Him...

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:30.080
that He might lay his hands on them
in prayer.

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.960
Disciples began to chastise Him.

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:37.200
But Jesus said,
"Let the children come to me.

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.960
Do not hinder them.

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.880
The kingdom of God
belongs to such as these."

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:46.520
He laid his hands on their heads...

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.480
before he left that place.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:51.520
Let us pray in silence.

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.520
Wanna go tree climbing?

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:58.880
His face hurts!
And where are his glasses?

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.560
He can't see without his glasses!

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.480
Put his glasses on!

01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:11.920
- He was going to be an acrobat.
- He's gone, sweetheart.

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:18.400
Wait!

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.360
I was just on my way to your house.

01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:39.600
You all right?
I'm so sorry about Thomas J.

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:43.560
We don't have to talk about him!

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.840
It's okay.
We won't talk about him.

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:51.560
Justin and Ronda say that I should
tell people what I feel.

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.920
Come here.
Sit down over here.

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.400
I love you.

01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.880
I love you like my dad loves Shelly.

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.800
And I wanna live here.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:14.040
I think your dad would miss you.

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:17.200
No, he wouldn't.
I can't go home.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:21.120
Hank, I'll be ready in a second.
I can't find my other earring.

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.480
This is Veda.

01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.960
- I'm really sorry.
- Could you give us a minute?

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.040
Who's that?

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:37.920
That's Suzanne.

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:45.600
She and I are gonna be married
this fall.

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:49.520
I was gonna bring her to class
next week.

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:52.120
I want her to hear your poem.

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:56.000
Please, honey.
I cared for him too.

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.960
- Please!
- Get away from me!

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.920
Sweetheart, don't...

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.960
<i>Why do you think people</i>
want to get married?

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.400
<i>When you get old,</i>
you just have to.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:46.000
<i>Who's that with your dad?</i>

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.640
<i>That's my mother.</i>

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.080
<i>I'm gonna be an acrobat</i>
when I grow up.

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.560
<i>Would you think of me?</i>

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:01.400
<i>If you don't get to marry</i>
Mr. Bixler.

01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:08.000
<i>Now we're blood brothers for life.</i>

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.240
- We haven't found her yet.
- She can't be alone in the dark!

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:31.240
- We'll keep looking.
- We've been looking since this morning.

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.720
Her teacher said...

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.640
I know. You told us.

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.440
Are you okay?

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.640
I should have told Thomas J.
he was my best friend.

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:52.520
I'm sure he knew.

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:06.360
I stole some money
from your cookie jar...

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:08.400
to pay for the writing class.

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.960
- It's okay.
- I'll pay you back.

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:18.760
Besides, I don't think
I'll ever go to class again.

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.240
Tell you what.

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:26.600
You dedicate your first book to me.
I'll forget the whole thing.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.600
I will. I promise.

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:30.560
Get into bed.

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.640
'Night.

01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:12.360
She's here.

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.680
- Did I kill my mother?
- What?

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:39.560
The bees killed Thomas J.,
and I killed my mother.

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.240
That wasn't your fault.

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:55.800
Things like that aren't anybody's fault.

01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:57.720
It just happened.

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:04.000
I found this.

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:11.080
I forgot about that picture.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.920
- Where'd you find it?
- In the garage.

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.640
That little Chevy
was your mother's favorite car.

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:21.120
What was my mama like?

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
She was pretty.

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:26.960
Kind.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.880
She had your eyes.

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.240
Did she love to laugh.

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.680
Sometimes when you laugh,
you sound just like her.

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.120
Really?

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:45.160
Know what she did when she found out
she was going to have you?

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:49.760
She came home
and painted this whole room pink.

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:53.280
She was so sure
she was going to have a little girl.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.680
Do you miss her?

01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.800
I did very much...

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:02.520
for a long time.

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:08.920
Even now, I get a little sad
when I think about a pretty flower...

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.480
or a beautiful sunset
she would have liked.

01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:16.160
I think every time I see a climbing
tree, I'll think of Thomas J.

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.720
That's good.

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:20.880
Memories are good, sweetheart.

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.480
I'm sorry.

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:29.720
I was trying to keep it from you.

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:34.360
I just couldn't.

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:40.760
You're a good girl.
I want you to be happy.

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:44.200
Don't be an old grump like me.

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:53.240
See you in the morning.

01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:57.960
Daddy.

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.200
It's not so bad to be like you.

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.800
How are you doing?

01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:33.800
Some days I think I'll be okay...

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:36.040
Others...

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:39.560
I have to force myself
even to get out of bed.

01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:43.680
I know it's crazy, but sometimes I think
he's just away at camp.

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:46.960
How's Veda?

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.640
She's doing much better.

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.600
She's just inside.

01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:04.720
I've been wanting to see you.

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:10.160
Thomas J. had this on him.

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.240
I thought you might like to have it.

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.640
You were such a good friend to him.

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.760
I hope you'll still come by
and visit me.

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:33.080
I will.
I promise.

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:45.160
Thomas J. will be all right.

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:47.520
My mother will take care of him.

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:52.480
Thank you.

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:04.360
"Encased in talent,
like a uniform...

01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:06.880
the rank of every poet
is well known.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:12.280
They can amaze us
like a thunderstorm...

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:15.640
or die so young...

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:17.880
or live for years alone."

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:23.800
My advice to you on our last class:

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.280
Be a thunderstorm.

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:31.160
What exactly do you mean by that?

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:37.160
I mean, be dangerous...

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.640
and unpredictable.

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:44.280
And make a lot of noise.

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:57.240
We missed you, man!
Give me a hug.

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:02.760
I was hoping you'd stop by today.

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.160
Can't stay.

01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:11.080
I just came to read my poem.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.000
We'd love to hear it.

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:22.360
"Weeping willow with your tears
running down...

01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:25.240
why do you always weep and frown?

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:28.160
Is it because he left you one day?

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:30.840
Is it because he could not stay?

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:34.280
On your branches he would swing.

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:37.840
Do you long for the happiness
that day would bring?

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:40.040
He found shelter in your shade.

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:43.760
You thought his laughter
would never fade.

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:47.800
Weeping willow, stop your tears.

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:50.400
There is something to calm your fears.

01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:55.480
You think death has ripped you
forever apart.

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:58.320
But I know he'll always
be in your heart."

01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:12.360
<i>Things are a little better these days.</i>

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:14.280
<i>I finally swallowed that chicken bone.</i>

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:17.040
<i>Judy and I are going to be</i>
in the same homeroom.

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:20.840
<i>And the Republican Party</i>
just renominated Mr. Nixon.
