00:00.300 --> 00:03.056
The police would like
to interview you all.

00:03.091 --> 00:05.329
Somebody gave that girl drugs.

00:05.364 --> 00:07.491
- So?
- I'll fucking...

00:07.526 --> 00:09.435
Thomas! It was me! Cook
dealt me the powder.

00:09.470 --> 00:10.171
What?!

00:10.176 --> 00:11.785
I slept with someone who wasn't you.

00:12.120 --> 00:12.641
What?!

00:12.676 --> 00:14.155
I told him I never want to see him.

00:14.190 --> 00:16.638
Well done. He needs to
think about what he did.

00:17.845 --> 00:20.018
I'm going to... expel you.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074

01:59.959 --> 02:01.995
The postman just looked at my tits!

02:02.030 --> 02:04.344
Yeah, he does that.

02:04.379 --> 02:07.064
You're supposed to be planning
us a route across Mexico.

02:07.099 --> 02:09.259
Sorry, I got bored
waiting for my garibaldis.

02:15.446 --> 02:17.926
Can you turn away a minute?

02:23.521 --> 02:24.501
Turn back.

02:29.899 --> 02:32.072
I saw these a while ago, and...

02:43.526 --> 02:44.697
I love you.

02:45.751 --> 02:47.321
Yeah, I know.

02:48.380 --> 02:49.904
Don't forget it, though.

02:51.878 --> 02:53.747
How do I look?

03:24.032 --> 03:25.932
What are you doing?

03:28.607 --> 03:30.791
Just clearing some space.

03:32.311 --> 03:34.211
Fitch hug.

03:44.417 --> 03:45.577
You too, big man.

03:45.956 --> 03:49.119
Oh, Mum. He wants to hug me again.

03:49.154 --> 03:51.141
Hug your father.

03:55.959 --> 03:58.416
Emily, in here, please.

04:13.091 --> 04:15.139
Can you take that stupid
thing off your head?

04:18.838 --> 04:21.571
We need to talk about
your options for next year.

04:22.606 --> 04:24.384
I'm going to Mexico with Naomi.

04:25.644 --> 04:27.732
Don't worry. It's all worked out.

04:28.067 --> 04:31.404
Well, a lot can change in a year, missy.

04:31.539 --> 04:35.042
Why don't you look at
these in the meantime?

04:35.077 --> 04:36.597
Have you seen my phone?

04:38.702 --> 04:41.432
You have six missed calls.

04:42.872 --> 04:44.396
All from me.

05:01.032 --> 05:04.921
Morning, Jenna. You're
looking very beautiful today.

05:24.922 --> 05:27.103
See you at lunch.

05:27.138 --> 05:28.685
Yeah. See you.

05:37.782 --> 05:39.606
What's the matter?

05:39.607 --> 05:41.853
Forgot for a second.

05:42.054 --> 05:43.054
About what?

05:43.055 --> 05:44.055
It's nothing to do with us.

05:46.318 --> 05:48.734
Ah, girls. Good. Follow me.

05:48.769 --> 05:50.411
Actually, don't. We're late.

05:50.446 --> 05:52.904
Frankly, Emily, I don't give a damn.

05:53.039 --> 05:57.023
The police are back and they want to
talk to you both about Sophia Moore.

05:57.058 --> 05:59.772
So come along, ladies. This way.

06:02.493 --> 06:05.542
So, how close were you to Sophia?

06:08.225 --> 06:09.647
We didn't know her.

06:10.951 --> 06:13.436
- Did you know her, Emily?
- No.

06:13.471 --> 06:15.372
You sure?

06:15.707 --> 06:17.629
We heard you three were quite chummy.

06:19.736 --> 06:20.718
Well, we weren't.

06:20.753 --> 06:22.384
Have you ever used MDMA?

06:24.107 --> 06:26.167
Uh... it's illegal.

06:26.702 --> 06:29.820
We found traces of it in Sophia's blood.

06:30.055 --> 06:33.086
We think she might have
bought it in the club.

06:33.121 --> 06:35.731
Did you see Sophia at the party?

06:35.766 --> 06:38.081
We only saw her...

06:38.116 --> 06:41.465
We were only at the party
for ten minutes or so.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.814
We went home long before...
before the accident.

06:44.849 --> 06:46.586
We didn't see her.

06:46.621 --> 06:48.323
Emily said you did.

06:51.344 --> 06:55.371
Um... no. I meant since the party.
There's been posters everywhere.

06:59.256 --> 07:01.449
What are you looking for, exactly?

07:01.484 --> 07:03.643
Just want more of a complete picture.

07:05.489 --> 07:07.628
We just want the truth.

07:10.967 --> 07:13.071
Why did we just lie to the police?

07:15.108 --> 07:17.032
Hey.

07:17.067 --> 07:20.207
It's me. What's going on?

07:31.579 --> 07:34.264
I did see her at the party.

07:34.499 --> 07:37.166
It was me who sold her the MDMA.

07:37.501 --> 07:39.461
Since when are you dealing?

07:39.496 --> 07:43.106
I needed some money and I thought
if I just went in on this MDMA...

07:43.141 --> 07:45.389
I could have lent you some money.

07:45.424 --> 07:46.799
It was for these.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.606
I thought I could keep you safe.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.187
I'm sorry.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.528
Who gave you the MDMA?

08:01.563 --> 08:04.635
- Why did you give them our names?
- Em, calm down.

08:04.670 --> 08:06.284
Course I didn't, man. Chillax.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.760
- They ain't got nothing on us.
- And you know that, do you?

08:08.795 --> 08:12.093
I nicked the fella's briefcase.
He's a fucking Bristol Rovers fan.

08:12.128 --> 08:15.291
His mum leaves notes in his
sandwiches. Look at that.

08:15.326 --> 08:18.087
- But what if they do know?
- That's what'll fuck this.

08:18.122 --> 08:21.000
Getting scared, poking around, causing
a fucking scene in the corridors.

08:21.035 --> 08:24.649
- He's right.
- Mum's the word, girls.

08:28.086 --> 08:30.220
Don't you want to know
why they had our names?

08:30.255 --> 08:30.777
No!

08:31.012 --> 08:33.318
- Why not?
- Because I don't want to go to jail.

08:33.352 --> 08:37.174
Could you just mind your own
fucking business for once, please?

08:37.210 --> 08:38.788
Ok. Sorry.

08:42.909 --> 08:45.958
We just have to act
like everything's fine.

08:57.049 --> 08:59.506
See you later.

09:22.852 --> 09:24.314
Hello.

09:24.349 --> 09:25.777
Hi.

09:26.341 --> 09:28.508
I'm a friend of Sophia's.

09:33.422 --> 09:36.809
Thank you for the flowers.

09:36.844 --> 09:39.517
Sorry. What was your name again?

09:39.552 --> 09:40.968
Nancy.

09:43.067 --> 09:45.347
She never mentioned a Nancy.

09:45.848 --> 09:48.643
But that's Sophia for you.

09:49.822 --> 09:50.855
Secretive.

09:52.976 --> 09:55.430
How did you know her?

09:56.324 --> 09:58.423
Just from... college and stuff.

09:58.358 --> 10:01.865
Are you in with Naomi
and Emily and that crowd?

10:04.418 --> 10:08.231
Um... yeah. I see them sometimes.

10:09.477 --> 10:11.727
I thought they'd have called round by now.

10:11.762 --> 10:15.377
- Sophia talked about them nonstop.
- Did she?

10:17.193 --> 10:20.556
Did she ever talk to you about me?

10:20.591 --> 10:21.796
Yeah...

10:22.847 --> 10:24.678
Yeah.

10:25.236 --> 10:27.933
She really... loved you.

10:29.353 --> 10:31.150
You're lying to me.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.754
It's kind of you.

10:39.008 --> 10:41.672
Hi, Matt. This is Nancy.

10:42.887 --> 10:45.082
Friend of your sister's.

10:48.066 --> 10:49.715
I'm going upstairs.

10:56.242 --> 10:57.846
Would you like to see her room?

11:01.785 --> 11:04.117
She never used to let me go in there.

11:05.176 --> 11:07.666
It was always so messy.

11:07.901 --> 11:11.568
If you want a memento, just...
just let me see what you've taken.

11:20.374 --> 11:21.807
I'll leave you to it.

12:20.653 --> 12:22.200
What are you doing?

12:22.235 --> 12:23.502
Nothing.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.065
What's your name again?

12:28.100 --> 12:32.184
- Nancy.
- Sophia never mentioned a Nancy.

12:34.392 --> 12:37.065
Did you know someone gave
her drugs the night she died?

12:37.100 --> 12:38.849
I didn't know.

12:39.184 --> 12:41.179
Were you her girlfriend?

12:41.214 --> 12:44.029
What? No. Girlfriend?

12:44.064 --> 12:47.427
You're fucking lying to me.

12:49.398 --> 12:51.878
They're saying she killed herself.

12:51.913 --> 12:53.411
That's bollocks.

12:54.502 --> 12:57.448
I know she didn't do that. How?

12:59.015 --> 13:00.971
Cos she didn't say goodbye to me.

13:04.004 --> 13:05.904
I'm so sorry.

13:07.028 --> 13:08.529
I found this.

13:17.447 --> 13:18.983
Get out.

14:23.598 --> 14:27.250
Hi, chicken. What's the matter?

14:27.285 --> 14:29.779
Is my mum here?

14:29.814 --> 14:33.705
Is it... whatshisname? JJ?
Your mum said he was nice.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.650
JJ?

14:35.685 --> 14:39.281
Now, if he's cheated on you, love,

14:39.316 --> 14:40.911
the thing to remember about young boys

14:40.946 --> 14:43.767
is that most of them would fuck
a snake if you put make-up on it.

14:43.802 --> 14:46.305
You can't take it personally. Hmm?

14:51.116 --> 14:53.503
You told Graham I was straight?

14:53.538 --> 14:56.325
Well, he's known you since
you were a little girl.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.558
He's gay as a window!

14:58.593 --> 15:01.244
He's an adult. He's
earned the right to be gay.

15:01.279 --> 15:03.215
You're too young to know what you are.

15:04.542 --> 15:06.400
I know, Mum.

15:06.435 --> 15:08.586
Oh, you bastard!

15:08.921 --> 15:11.066
You think you know.

15:11.101 --> 15:15.877
Is there any specific reason why
you've been crying? Maybe Naomi?

15:16.602 --> 15:18.520
No, we're fine.

15:20.732 --> 15:23.587
You should go travelling to find yourself.

15:23.622 --> 15:25.520
Wouldn't she just get in the way?

15:25.555 --> 15:28.000
She's my fucking girlfriend!

15:28.035 --> 15:30.155
You've got nothing to do with this.

15:30.190 --> 15:32.019
All right. All right!

15:32.572 --> 15:34.497
Wouldn't you like to
set out on an adventure on your...

15:34.532 --> 15:38.206
No! Get used to it!

15:38.241 --> 15:40.644
So... what if I was to give you Â£1,000?

15:40.679 --> 15:42.291
- Would that change things?
- What?!

15:42.326 --> 15:46.410
- Now you're bribing me.
- Oh, Emily. You're mine!

15:46.445 --> 15:48.344
I'm just trying to help you.

15:48.379 --> 15:50.203
Naomi's not right for you.

15:50.238 --> 15:52.097
And there's something about her...

15:52.132 --> 15:53.680
something I don't quite like.

15:53.715 --> 15:55.818
I'm just telling you.

15:55.853 --> 15:58.122
Shove it up your tits.

15:58.976 --> 16:02.298
Please, they're
planning work down there.

16:34.206 --> 16:38.258
- So how was your bath?
- What bath?

16:38.293 --> 16:41.401
The one you popped home to
take about three months ago.

16:41.413 --> 16:44.788
Right. I went to Italy.

16:44.823 --> 16:46.232
Italy?

16:46.267 --> 16:49.023
Si. How was your summer?

16:49.058 --> 16:50.933
Not bad. Got chlamydia.

16:51.068 --> 16:54.738
- Wow! Exotic.
- That's what I said.

16:54.773 --> 16:56.874
Then I realised Cook had it as well

16:56.909 --> 17:00.745
and it didn't feel quite so
special, if you know what I mean.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.491
I bet it liked you more.

17:04.561 --> 17:06.021
So, who gave it to who?

17:06.057 --> 17:09.117
We didn't. There was an intermediary.

17:09.152 --> 17:11.707
And you're... all clear now?

17:12.952 --> 17:14.786
Oh! Yeah, fine now.

17:14.820 --> 17:16.579
Clear as a... bell.

17:16.614 --> 17:20.277
Not sure about him, though.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.910
It's you I spent all
summer thinking about.

17:43.912 --> 17:45.952
So what is it?

17:45.987 --> 17:48.308
Is it my food or my
winning personality today?

17:54.659 --> 17:58.060
Have you ever... loved someone and then...

17:58.095 --> 18:00.376
something happens and...

18:00.411 --> 18:03.641
you wonder if perhaps you
didn't ever know them at all?

18:05.678 --> 18:07.493
Do you trust her?

18:07.528 --> 18:09.596
What? No?

18:09.631 --> 18:12.576
- What? No, I don't need to.
- But... if you two got together,

18:12.611 --> 18:16.282
wouldn't you be worried
she might fuck Cook again?

18:16.317 --> 18:17.831
That hurt!

18:17.866 --> 18:19.561
Emily, I'm sorry.

18:20.848 --> 18:22.600
I'm just a bit busy at the minute, ok?

18:50.742 --> 18:52.587
Why didn't you tell me you knew her?

18:53.522 --> 18:55.556
I met her once, at an open day.

18:55.591 --> 18:56.844
What open day?

18:56.979 --> 18:59.196
It was an open day. What does it matter?

18:59.231 --> 19:01.970
We're going travelling
next year. We decided.

19:02.005 --> 19:03.154
You decided.

19:03.889 --> 19:06.854
Look, I went to an open day,

19:06.889 --> 19:09.961
I met a girl, we talked... that's it.

19:09.996 --> 19:11.409
You should have told me.

19:11.444 --> 19:13.801
Well, how could I, without
telling you where I met her?

19:13.836 --> 19:17.522
I didn't want a referendum on our
relationship over a stupid open day.

19:18.290 --> 19:21.374
- Did you know she was gay?
- I met her once.

19:21.709 --> 19:23.403
Did you fuck her?

19:23.438 --> 19:27.730
No! You think I'd shag some
random girl behind your back?

19:27.765 --> 19:30.622
I'm not saying you did it.
Well, what are you saying?

19:30.657 --> 19:33.457
- I'm just asking.
- Why are you acting like this?

19:34.559 --> 19:38.484
- Her mum seems to think we knew her.
- What?

19:38.919 --> 19:40.746
I went to her house today.

19:41.993 --> 19:44.336
You promised me you'd stay out of it.

19:44.571 --> 19:46.334
Stay out of it.

19:48.092 --> 19:49.819
Do you know what this is for?

19:55.762 --> 19:57.853
Something to do with the Army.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.145
Probably her cadet locker key.

20:00.146 --> 20:02.285
How do you even know that, Naomi?

20:05.966 --> 20:08.291
Where are you going?

20:08.492 --> 20:10.431
I'm going to find out if you're lying.

20:10.766 --> 20:12.563
Oh, nice!

20:12.798 --> 20:14.661
Let's go, then.

20:14.996 --> 20:16.527
Fine.

20:20.340 --> 20:22.228
<i>Left! Right! Left! Right!</i>

20:22.263 --> 20:23.923
<i>Left! Right! Left! Right!</i>

20:47.994 --> 20:49.643
<i>What the fuck?</i>

21:11.684 --> 21:13.595
That's my old toothbrush.

21:13.630 --> 21:16.137
It's your bracelet.

21:16.172 --> 21:17.628
Is this the one you lost?

21:30.014 --> 21:31.970
She went through my rubbish.

21:34.292 --> 21:35.680
Close it.

21:36.215 --> 21:37.899
Please, close it.

21:50.591 --> 21:52.564
It's ok.

21:54.458 --> 21:56.549
<i>Left! Right! Left! Right!</i>

21:56.584 --> 22:00.964
<i>Left! Right! Left! Right!
Left! Right! Left! Right!</i>

22:00.999 --> 22:02.592
<i>Left! Left!</i>

22:02.627 --> 22:04.143
<i>Right! Left!</i>

22:04.178 --> 22:08.365
<i>Left! Right! Left! Right! Left! Right!</i>

22:08.400 --> 22:10.565
<i>Left! Right! Left!</i>

22:23.259 --> 22:24.859
<i>Return!</i>

22:26.543 --> 22:28.342
She stalked me.

22:30.989 --> 22:32.655
You're very stalkable.

23:36.401 --> 23:38.701
Sam's a post room co-ordinator.

23:38.736 --> 23:40.591
Oh, very nice.

23:40.626 --> 23:44.187
Oh, yeah. He's, like,
responsible. Aren't you, sweetie?

23:44.222 --> 23:46.329
Yeah, babe.

23:48.785 --> 23:50.893
No more room for carrot flan, Rob?

23:51.428 --> 23:54.147
Think I've had too much
of a good thing, love.

23:54.182 --> 23:58.008
I love carrots. This stuff
is off the hook, Jenna.

23:57.843 --> 24:01.534
Oh, thank you, Samuel.
That is so sweet of you.

24:01.569 --> 24:03.633
This one's a keeper,
isn't he, Katie-kins?

24:03.668 --> 24:07.263
He's an arse-licker is what he
is. But we're letting that one go.

24:08.198 --> 24:09.325
Well.

24:09.260 --> 24:10.448
Is Naomi coming?

24:10.483 --> 24:12.251
No, Naomi couldn't make it.

24:12.286 --> 24:14.445
Oh. I wanted to show her my new number.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.330
Stop calling it a number.

24:16.565 --> 24:19.250
A lot of boys become very
curious in women's clothing

24:19.285 --> 24:20.694
once they approach pub-erty.

24:20.729 --> 24:23.424
It's called pu-berty, little dude.

24:23.459 --> 24:25.460
Sam's really clever. Ain't you, babes?

24:25.470 --> 24:28.286
- Why is he here?
- Because he's my new boyfriend.

24:28.421 --> 24:31.527
- Eat your flan.
- You said Naomi couldn't come to a family dinner.

24:31.562 --> 24:35.334
This is a six-seater table,
Emily. What do you want me to do?

24:37.471 --> 24:41.141
Anyway, this dinner is a happy time

24:41.176 --> 24:45.185
because yesterday I got my
kick-starter takeoff loan approved.

24:45.620 --> 24:46.450
Loan?

24:46.485 --> 24:49.244
As from next week, I'm quitting the salon

24:49.279 --> 24:51.774
and will become the managing director

24:51.809 --> 24:55.461
of Bristol's premier new
wedding-planning service...

24:55.996 --> 24:58.156
Let's Get Fitched!

24:58.291 --> 25:00.594
Let's Get Fitched?

25:01.129 --> 25:03.375
Let's Get Fitched... get it?

25:03.410 --> 25:04.677
Yeah. That's good.

25:04.712 --> 25:07.806
Yeah, but... I thought we
were going to talk about that.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.224
We did, Rob. And we decided.

25:11.374 --> 25:12.921
This is my shimmering dream.

25:12.956 --> 25:14.632
Ah! Toast?

25:14.667 --> 25:16.265
Word.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.450
Got the really expensive stuff as well.

25:19.793 --> 25:21.795
I've lost the gym.

25:24.321 --> 25:25.624
What?

25:26.821 --> 25:28.379
I've lost it, love.

25:29.404 --> 25:33.238
No! But that's your gym, Rob.

25:33.273 --> 25:36.383
It's the bank's gym now.

25:36.418 --> 25:37.982
You're unemployed?

25:38.017 --> 25:39.166
YYeah, love.

25:40.156 --> 25:43.286
I'm bankrupt. But don't worry.

25:43.321 --> 25:46.870
I've got an inside tip that they're
going to be recruiting at Virgin Active.

25:48.674 --> 25:53.144
But what about money?
I mean, we need money.

25:53.479 --> 25:55.531
I was going to give Emily money.

25:55.566 --> 25:57.642
- I don't want it.
- What money?

25:57.677 --> 26:00.572
She was going to bribe me not
to go travelling with Naomi.

26:00.607 --> 26:03.567
It is not a bribe. It's just
money I promised my daughter.

26:03.602 --> 26:05.474
Yeah? Well, where's my money?

26:05.509 --> 26:07.107
No-one's getting any money.

26:07.142 --> 26:10.568
- I'm giving Emily money.
- I don't want it.

26:11.003 --> 26:14.077
Don't you get it? I want Naomi.

26:13.912 --> 26:15.235
I want to fuck Naomi.

26:16.286 --> 26:19.016
What? I do. Get over it.

26:19.651 --> 26:20.897
Rob!

26:20.932 --> 26:22.915
Did you just hear what he said?

26:22.950 --> 26:24.643
She is attractive, love.

26:24.678 --> 26:26.692
Fuck, Rob! He said "fuck"!

26:27.227 --> 26:30.340
Now do you see what
she's done to our family?

26:31.851 --> 26:34.085
- I'm moving out.
- Don't be rash, love.

26:34.120 --> 26:37.753
Britney, stop saying
"fuck". Emsy, sit down.

26:37.788 --> 26:39.374
No. I don't want to live here any more.

26:39.409 --> 26:42.177
Fine. Get out. Go on. Get out!

26:42.412 --> 26:44.642
You're not welcome in this home any more!

26:44.677 --> 26:46.844
You or Naomi!

26:55.009 --> 26:56.530
That's my top.

26:58.048 --> 27:00.346
You know Mum doesn't
mean to be a total bitch.

27:00.381 --> 27:01.985
Yes, she does. And you let her.

27:02.020 --> 27:03.532
She's trying to help you.

27:03.567 --> 27:05.897
It's all fake.

27:05.932 --> 27:08.043
This whole family's fake.

27:08.078 --> 27:09.044
I'm not fake.

27:09.279 --> 27:11.265
Fake tan? Fake boyfriend.

27:11.400 --> 27:12.801
Fake concern.

27:12.836 --> 27:15.360
I am concerned! Bitch!

27:15.395 --> 27:18.573
And for your information, I was
in the sun for five hours today.

27:18.608 --> 27:21.118
And as for my boyfriend, he may be little,

27:21.153 --> 27:22.521
but for your further information,

27:22.556 --> 27:25.433
he's sweet, trustworthy
and totally hung, ok?

27:25.434 --> 27:28.162
Who said I was little?

27:28.297 --> 27:31.091
Can you get the fuck out, babes?

27:31.626 --> 27:33.074
He's definitely a keeper.

27:33.109 --> 27:34.623
God, you're a selfish cow.

27:34.569 --> 27:38.072
- Oh, fuck off, Kate.
- Please don't go.

27:38.107 --> 27:39.611
I'll back you up.

28:00.195 --> 28:02.862
You want to pick a better
fake name next time.

28:02.897 --> 28:04.576
There's no Nancys at Roundview.

28:04.611 --> 28:06.538
And only one red-haired
girl with a moped.

28:06.573 --> 28:08.950
- You've been checking up on me?
- You lied.

28:20.832 --> 28:22.504
I think it's pretty clear.

28:33.689 --> 28:35.817
She killed herself.

28:36.418 --> 28:38.018
Was it you?

28:38.119 --> 28:39.219
Was it you, she killed herself?

28:39.252 --> 28:42.619
No. And it wasn't Naomi, ok?

28:43.219 --> 28:45.501
She didn't know either of
us. She lied about that.

28:45.516 --> 28:47.835
- She wouldn't lie to me.
- She lied to everyone!

28:47.870 --> 28:50.958
I'm sorry you feel angry at her but
it's really not my fucking problem.

28:51.193 --> 28:53.475
I need the truth.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.421
This isn't all of it.

28:56.756 --> 28:58.198
No.

28:59.752 --> 29:02.152
Emily, what are you scared of?

29:05.134 --> 29:06.958
We can help each other.

29:19.094 --> 29:22.913
Is it so out of the question
that I might know what's best?

29:22.948 --> 29:25.620
I'm not talking to you.

29:27.342 --> 29:28.304
Emily.

29:29.348 --> 29:31.415
I don't want you to move out.

29:31.943 --> 29:32.823
I don't care.

29:32.858 --> 29:35.692
I'm just trying to help you!

29:35.927 --> 29:37.898
Fuck off!

30:05.056 --> 30:09.401
"What is it, Sophia?
What did you lock up?"

30:47.562 --> 30:49.368
Yes. Fucking...

30:49.603 --> 30:51.878
Oh, no. It's ok. It's just Emily.

30:55.703 --> 30:56.537
Bonsoir.

30:56.872 --> 30:59.125
Who was that?

30:59.160 --> 31:01.302
Oh, just my mum.

31:01.337 --> 31:02.965
What's all this?

31:03.000 --> 31:04.549
I'm moving in.

31:04.584 --> 31:05.630
Where?

31:05.665 --> 31:06.983
Here.

31:07.018 --> 31:12.242
Uh... isn't that the sort of
thing people usually discuss?

31:12.777 --> 31:14.728
I need to, ok?

31:14.763 --> 31:16.393
OK.

31:16.428 --> 31:18.381
- Ok?
- Ok!

31:18.416 --> 31:21.331
Although, in many ways,
it's sort of a violation.

31:21.366 --> 31:23.658
But fuck it. It's ok.

31:23.693 --> 31:24.494
Really?

31:24.529 --> 31:26.606
Really! It'll be great.

31:26.641 --> 31:28.684
You can be my pyjamas.

31:32.796 --> 31:35.419
You need to do something
about your moustache.

31:35.654 --> 31:37.136
What?

32:02.224 --> 32:04.542
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

32:26.209 --> 32:28.806
This is just kind of terrible.

32:28.841 --> 32:30.089
Yeah.

32:30.719 --> 32:32.507
Fuck it!

32:32.642 --> 32:35.967
If it's rubbish, we'll
just go back to ours.

32:36.668 --> 32:37.968
Where?

32:40.371 --> 32:41.804
Ours.

32:58.450 --> 32:59.824
Naomi!

32:59.859 --> 33:02.792
Stay alive! I will find you.

33:06.984 --> 33:08.629
Hi.

33:09.064 --> 33:10.643
How you doing?

33:10.678 --> 33:13.173
This is the worst party I've ever been to.

33:13.608 --> 33:14.885
The worst.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.127
Really?

33:16.162 --> 33:19.044
Panda's giving Thommo a dose
of the old look-at-me routine.

33:19.379 --> 33:20.994
You know how it is...

33:21.029 --> 33:24.327
letting your exes know
that you're out there,

33:24.362 --> 33:26.095
that other people find you attractive...

33:27.112 --> 33:29.324
That everything you
thought you had together...

33:29.359 --> 33:30.987
they can do without it.

33:31.022 --> 33:33.016
That they don't need you.

33:35.354 --> 33:38.829
That guy over there keeps staring at you.

33:38.864 --> 33:40.991
I merely observed.

33:55.128 --> 33:57.093
Let it go.

33:57.128 --> 33:59.835
Let it go before you screw everything up.

34:02.366 --> 34:04.881
Cook, excuse me?

34:04.916 --> 34:07.157
I don't want to see your muff.

34:10.268 --> 34:12.647
Emilio looks jealous.

34:12.681 --> 34:16.300
It's probably still not too late
to be overcome by desire with me.

34:16.534 --> 34:18.250
I could turn you, deffo.

34:18.284 --> 34:18.958
Fuck off.

34:18.994 --> 34:20.629
No, I'm serious.

34:21.063 --> 34:24.248
It's probably been a while, innit,
since you've seen one of these.

34:24.283 --> 34:28.168
Look, mine is totally oustanding, man.

34:29.904 --> 34:31.878
What's up, Emilio, man?

34:33.534 --> 34:35.803
Why are you hiding in the pisser?

34:35.838 --> 34:38.072
Do you ever get jealous, Cook?

34:39.480 --> 34:40.771
If your shag's a shag,

34:40.806 --> 34:44.908
then you're always going to get your
heart ripped out somewhere, aren't you?

34:44.943 --> 34:46.610
What do you do about it?

34:46.645 --> 34:48.750
You just burn, kid.

34:48.784 --> 34:50.856
You just burn. You just
keep it on the inside.

34:50.891 --> 34:52.098
Is that possible?

34:52.033 --> 34:53.049
Yeah.

34:53.083 --> 34:55.554
Cos you look a bit stupid
if you don't, don't you?

34:55.589 --> 34:57.890
Look at me, love. Happy.

35:01.746 --> 35:03.589
Effy.

35:05.220 --> 35:08.264
You don't tell any of my secrets
and I won't tell any of yours.

35:08.299 --> 35:10.418
Or we could just go out
there in a blaze of glory.

35:10.453 --> 35:12.519
Dance, muff monkey?

35:12.520 --> 35:15.268
- You got it.
- Come on, then, kid.

35:29.564 --> 35:31.309
Oh, sorry.

35:32.833 --> 35:35.629
- Cook!
- Get off me now. Get off!

35:51.085 --> 35:53.668
Who fucking wants one now?

36:48.559 --> 36:50.738
<i>"I need to see you.</i>

36:50.773 --> 36:52.379
<i>No, now.</i>

36:52.714 --> 36:55.206
<i>I've got something I need to show you.</i>

36:55.241 --> 36:56.962
<i>Tonight."</i>

38:03.191 --> 38:05.655
Why did you?

38:19.348 --> 38:20.894
Why here?

38:21.029 --> 38:23.300
I dunno.

38:23.335 --> 38:26.187
This is where it ends.

38:26.222 --> 38:28.291
I've got something to show you.

38:28.326 --> 38:30.769
I think she wanted you to have this.

38:34.033 --> 38:35.853
I got it from her cadet locker.

38:38.277 --> 38:40.743
I need to know what's in there.

38:40.978 --> 38:43.001
Me too.

38:43.336 --> 38:46.615
It's her work... her diary, you know?

38:46.650 --> 38:48.380
Can't we just leave it?

38:51.346 --> 38:54.588
I don't think we can, Naoms.

38:55.797 --> 38:59.348
She's dead. Let it go.

39:01.068 --> 39:01.778
I can't.

39:01.813 --> 39:03.457
See you round.

39:04.792 --> 39:06.510
Can't we just go home?

39:10.622 --> 39:12.615
Matt, come back!

39:15.324 --> 39:17.588
Emily, please!

39:21.830 --> 39:24.133
Emily! Wait!

39:37.812 --> 39:39.366
Please!

39:39.401 --> 39:41.096
Can't we just go home?

39:41.131 --> 39:43.208
I don't think so.

39:47.547 --> 39:49.310
I made this for her.

39:50.452 --> 39:52.019
Woodwork, you know?

39:53.508 --> 39:54.964
Yeah.

40:36.716 --> 40:38.871
<i>"I can't stop crying.</i>

40:38.906 --> 40:42.128
<i>I've tried to stop
thinking, but it doesn't work.</i>

40:42.163 --> 40:44.252
<i>You don't expect stuff to happen.</i>

40:44.387 --> 40:45.852
<i>You can't control it.</i>

40:45.887 --> 40:47.556
<i>You can't control anything.</i>

40:47.591 --> 40:52.531
<i>So I'm at this stupid open day
and everyone's snotty and rude,</i>

40:52.566 --> 40:54.734
<i>and then I see someone.</i>

40:55.774 --> 40:57.927
<i>I'd never even spoken to her at Roundview.</i>

40:57.962 --> 41:02.098
<i>It didn't seem to matter because
then everything got really fun.</i>

41:02.133 --> 41:03.636
<i>And by the time we were on our way home,</i>

41:03.671 --> 41:05.565
<i>we were telling secrets.</i>

41:05.600 --> 41:07.619
<i>I wanted to move my hand.</i>

41:07.654 --> 41:09.639
<i>I wanted to move it so much.</i>

41:11.358 --> 41:13.610
<i>And then she moved hers.</i>

41:14.727 --> 41:18.254
<i>I wish I'd told Naomi how easy
it is for me to love someone.</i>

41:20.453 --> 41:24.241
<i>We're all lonely and all
we want is for someone to...</i>

41:24.276 --> 41:26.743
<i>you know, pay attention</i>

41:26.778 --> 41:29.421
<i>and tell us we're beautiful and cute</i>

41:29.456 --> 41:31.863
<i>and say that they want to..."</i>

41:44.576 --> 41:46.216
I don't believe it.

41:47.603 --> 41:51.118
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

42:18.824 --> 42:20.139
You've ruined it.

42:22.929 --> 42:24.410
You don't want anyone to care.

42:31.533 --> 42:33.533
I could be dead in a second.

42:34.829 --> 42:36.604
Everything's...

42:36.639 --> 42:40.279
so... fragile.

42:41.338 --> 42:43.087
Didn't you realise that?

42:46.539 --> 42:48.873
We were special.

43:05.466 --> 43:07.834
- I was scared!
- You're always scared.

43:08.169 --> 43:09.674
Emily!

43:11.932 --> 43:13.511
Emily!

43:33.481 --> 43:35.206
Naomi cheated.

43:35.241 --> 43:40.122
And... I don't know why she did that.

43:41.309 --> 43:43.061
Oh, love.

43:44.662 --> 43:46.362
Sweet girl.

43:46.697 --> 43:48.095
I hate her.

43:48.130 --> 43:51.194
- I know you do.
- I hate her!

43:51.229 --> 43:53.636
I know, love. It's ok.

43:55.814 --> 43:59.113
Listen, I want to tell you something.

43:59.148 --> 44:00.856
Listen to me.

44:05.485 --> 44:07.555
You know, I cheated on your mum once.

44:08.290 --> 44:09.054
What?

44:09.089 --> 44:13.879
I was young. I was too young. I was 19.

44:13.914 --> 44:15.445
I'd been married for two years.

44:15.480 --> 44:18.870
Her family always saying what's what.

44:18.905 --> 44:21.046
Scottish people.

44:22.320 --> 44:23.969
God knows I regretted it.

44:25.525 --> 44:29.217
Your Aunty Julie's no better-looking
now than what she was then.

44:29.252 --> 44:30.817
Her sister!

44:32.683 --> 44:34.096
People do stupid things

44:34.231 --> 44:37.016
when they're trying to act
like they're not trapped.

44:37.451 --> 44:39.644
Was it ever the same again?

44:41.029 --> 44:43.542
It was worse.

44:43.677 --> 44:45.473
And then it was ok.

44:45.608 --> 44:47.369
Then it got better.

44:48.711 --> 44:50.113
And then we got you.

44:50.248 --> 44:52.282
We got all the things we love.

44:56.482 --> 44:58.996
Did she hate herself for taking you back?

44:59.331 --> 45:00.481
What?

45:00.516 --> 45:02.695
Hate herself? What for?

45:02.730 --> 45:04.425
She didn't do anything wrong.

45:05.769 --> 45:07.500
She hated me, though.

45:07.501 --> 45:09.723
For a very, very, very long time.

45:09.758 --> 45:13.141
She's tough, your mum, you know.
You want to be glad of that.

45:15.059 --> 45:16.781
I'm not like her, Dad.

45:19.842 --> 45:22.076
That's ok, too.
