00:29.863 --> 00:31.364
Hello, Papa.

00:31.448 --> 00:32.574
Did you find work?

00:34.117 --> 00:35.869
Rent's late again.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.079
I'll take care of it.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.790
How? With your work?

00:44.878 --> 00:46.713
I have work.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.759
<i>You know, I've lived here my whole life.</i>

00:52.469 --> 00:54.345
<i>I've watched these corporations come in,</i>

00:55.263 --> 00:58.641
<i>and build their factories,</i>
<i>as if we don't exist.</i>

00:58.725 --> 01:01.352
<i>They say they're giving us opportunities</i>
<i>by creating jobs.</i>

01:03.396 --> 01:04.898
<i>And when things go bad,</i>

01:05.899 --> 01:08.234
<i>when people get hurt,</i>

01:09.652 --> 01:11.780
<i>our "saviors" disappear.</i>

01:13.448 --> 01:14.699
They don't care about us,

01:15.492 --> 01:17.327
unless we do something.

01:19.454 --> 01:20.371
Yes?

01:28.838 --> 01:30.256
Tell me about your husband.

01:31.591 --> 01:32.842
What was he like?

01:34.594 --> 01:36.763
-Hmm?

01:36.846 --> 01:38.765
-He was funny.
-Hmm.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.475
He loved baseball.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.188
He loved his job.

01:49.484 --> 01:50.860
Was that where…

01:53.488 --> 01:54.489
it happened?

01:57.534 --> 01:58.785
He was…

01:59.911 --> 02:01.621
running a test,

02:03.581 --> 02:05.375
and the cage was left open…

02:06.376 --> 02:07.710
and the rat bit him.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.255
He told me…

02:12.090 --> 02:13.091
that it was so fast.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.051
You mentioned…

02:16.344 --> 02:17.345
a rash?

02:19.931 --> 02:21.516
Were there any other symptoms?

02:21.599 --> 02:22.559
Yes.

02:24.477 --> 02:28.731
He complained about flashing lights,
loud noises…

02:28.815 --> 02:31.109
…even the baby would bother him,

02:32.068 --> 02:33.194
and then,

02:35.655 --> 02:37.448
he would get angry all the time.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.743
He became very aggressive.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.580
And these symptoms,

02:46.124 --> 02:47.500
they lasted for three days?

02:55.341 --> 02:57.093
They said he killed people.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.518
You don't believe me, do you?

03:10.315 --> 03:11.566
Of course I believe you.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.248
I found this.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.499
In his things.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.337
People need to know the truth,

03:33.630 --> 03:34.923
<i>because them…</i>

03:36.591 --> 03:37.550
<i>They lie.</i>

03:40.220 --> 03:42.972
Umbrella lies.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.037
Heretics.

04:53.626 --> 04:57.380
So the kitty cat lady told me
that you worked for the University.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.465
You know they're
on the naughty list, right?

05:00.800 --> 05:03.511
Hear they've got copies
of everything from before the fall.

05:04.345 --> 05:05.722
Books, music…

05:06.931 --> 05:08.016
<i>SpongeBob.</i>

05:08.099 --> 05:09.851
I freakin' loved SpongeBob.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.687
I mean, his best friend is a starfish.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.273
Are you fucking serious?

05:15.356 --> 05:16.816
Jeez, relax.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.279
I've got a chip in my arm.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.282
Umbrella is on the way.

05:30.204 --> 05:31.622
Test 328.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.042
Analyzing specimen.

05:51.893 --> 05:52.977
Go!

05:54.812 --> 05:56.022
Get out!

06:32.266 --> 06:33.434
Simon?

06:37.480 --> 06:38.523
What kind of party?

06:39.482 --> 06:42.693
Probably a bunch of stupid kids
doing stupid shit.

06:45.071 --> 06:45.988
What time is it?

06:46.072 --> 06:47.073
One minute later
than the last time you asked.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.741
-Jade--
-Look, that guy was crazy.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.619
-How much time is left?
-Three hours, 22 minutes.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.057
Maybe we should tell Dad.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.476
-Nothing's gonna happen.
-You keep saying that.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.311
But you don't know a…

07:19.981 --> 07:21.190
I'm so hot.

07:22.608 --> 07:23.818
You're freaked.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.529
-Just inhale.
-Yeah, that's…

07:29.282 --> 07:30.658
You don't get it.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.209
I wanna go to that party.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.713
-No, Billie, you can't.
-Dad said this isn't quarantine.

07:43.796 --> 07:47.091
So if I'm gonna die,

07:47.675 --> 07:53.306
then I'm not sitting here
waiting for it to happen, if it happens.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.559
So fuck it.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.437
Right?

08:19.707 --> 08:20.750
Where are we?

08:23.127 --> 08:24.420
I've got an idea.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.048
ATTENTION!

08:34.680 --> 08:35.890
Do you see that?

08:37.308 --> 08:42.355
It's an enclosed space with limited exits,
and about 300 barely contained zeros.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.735
This place is a fucking meat grinder.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.362
Move, move.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.034
Come on.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.249
Umbrella.

09:43.332 --> 09:44.458
I'm not Umbrella.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.252
Uh, I am.

09:46.335 --> 09:49.714
So the smart move here is to let us go

09:49.797 --> 09:53.801
before my boss rains
holy hell down on you.

09:54.343 --> 09:55.636
"Holy hell."

09:56.846 --> 09:57.930
I like this.

09:58.764 --> 10:02.476
This is the world, no? A "holy hell."

10:05.229 --> 10:07.398
The last Umbrella to come here…

10:08.065 --> 10:10.943
I sent him home
with his balls in his hand.

10:11.694 --> 10:12.737
Cool. Uh…

10:12.820 --> 10:17.825
I mean, with me, it'd take both hands,
but, yeah, no, I… I get it.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.243
You're real scary.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.329
So what do you want, huh?

10:21.996 --> 10:24.999
Money? Tech? Meth?

10:27.460 --> 10:28.502
It's meth, right?

10:29.587 --> 10:30.880
You think we can be bought?

10:30.963 --> 10:32.173
For the right price.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.258
We are all whores.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.678
And a whore belongs on his knees.

10:40.264 --> 10:42.933
Wait, wait, wait,
I'm not with this asshole.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.521
Yet you were with this asshole.

10:48.606 --> 10:49.815
He was trying to take me to Umbrella.

10:52.818 --> 10:53.653
Why?

10:53.736 --> 10:55.196
The virus.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.281
I'm trying to understand it, stop it.

10:57.365 --> 11:00.201
-It can't be stopped.
-Then contain it.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.036
I'm trying to help people.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.580
The plague is a scourge from God.

11:05.539 --> 11:08.292
Who are you to question the will of God?

11:08.376 --> 11:09.669
I'm sorry, did…

11:09.752 --> 11:11.170
You think God did this?

11:13.089 --> 11:14.548
Then what the fuck are those?

11:20.638 --> 11:22.390
His miracle.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.267
To be harnessed by the chosen.

11:32.858 --> 11:33.693
"Chosen"?

11:34.276 --> 11:36.070
Billions of people died.

11:36.153 --> 11:37.988
To rid the apple of the worm,

11:38.072 --> 11:39.490
it takes the knife.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.119
They died to make a better world.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.542
Fuck you!

11:57.258 --> 11:58.467
Butt implants.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.928
Yeah, you need to talk to him.
He's been staring at you all night.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.557
Fake boobs.

12:07.017 --> 12:09.019
Also, big boobs.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.981
See that weird guy over there? Red shirt?

12:12.064 --> 12:13.023
That's hair plugs.

12:13.816 --> 12:14.734
I'm telling you.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.819
Ooh, Botox.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.864
And he's on steroids.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.490
Hard steroids.

12:21.574 --> 12:22.992
No one should be that ripped.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.788
And she just got her vag wallpapered.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.208
That's not a thing.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.544
-You know, it probably is in LA.

12:33.627 --> 12:35.129
Probably is.

12:38.382 --> 12:39.383
You know, if…

12:41.260 --> 12:43.137
If I go crazy,
I need you to get away from me.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.221
-No.
-No.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.808
-It's you and me, always.
-Seriously.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.059
Say it.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.436
-Billie--
-Say it.

12:54.648 --> 12:55.733
Okay, I'll…

12:58.068 --> 12:58.903
Okay.

13:00.738 --> 13:01.739
But…

13:03.491 --> 13:04.909
everything's gonna be fine.

13:22.593 --> 13:23.677
Get off me.

13:29.141 --> 13:33.270
So my favorite part was
when you punched him in the face.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.279
Fuck, look at these cult freaks.

13:42.363 --> 13:47.159
-Look at yourself.
-Dude, I know you've got, like baggage.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.704
But between Umbrella
and crazy-freak crucifixion world,

13:50.788 --> 13:51.997
I know which one I'd pick.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.833
Umbrella's done worse, and you know it.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.084
Yeah, not to me.

13:55.584 --> 13:57.461
Oh, so what? Fuck everyone else?

14:04.093 --> 14:05.261
Do you have kids?

14:07.763 --> 14:08.722
Because I do.

14:10.933 --> 14:11.976
Charlie and Cardi.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.440
They are… my life.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.321
Umbrella takes care of me,
so I can take care…

14:24.905 --> 14:25.906
of them.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.416
Fucking really?

14:36.917 --> 14:38.752
Such an asshole.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.130
Cool, yeah. Yeah, no, real cool.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.841
So you hate dogs? Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.

14:43.924 --> 14:48.053
So I guess that all you Wesker kids
have rage issues, because your sister?

14:48.137 --> 14:49.847
Fucking psycho.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.146
My sister is dead.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.359
She died when I was 14.

15:14.872 --> 15:15.915
Watch it.

15:24.882 --> 15:25.966
-Hey, hi.
-Thanks for coming.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.593
-Such a dope setup.
-Yeah, thanks.

15:27.676 --> 15:30.387
-"Hey, hi. Dope setup."

15:33.057 --> 15:34.183
What up?

15:43.025 --> 15:44.318
That was sick.

15:51.617 --> 15:52.493
Hi.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.664
Billie, um…

15:56.747 --> 15:59.458
About yesterday, look, I'm so sorry.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.752
No… no, it's not your fault.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.005
I'm going crazy.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.383
Cool.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.676
Yeah.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.052
I'm sorry.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.762
Can I borrow your board?

16:12.471 --> 16:13.514
-Sure.
-What?

16:15.432 --> 16:16.433
It'll be fun.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.768
Watch.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.150
Well, she seems… good?

16:30.864 --> 16:32.616
Sorry.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.160
What are you doing?

16:36.996 --> 16:37.913
I'm gonna jump.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.164
How do you deal…

16:40.249 --> 16:41.709
living in this town?

16:42.209 --> 16:43.836
I hit on all the new girls.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.212
-Oh, really?

16:45.963 --> 16:47.172
No, no. I…

16:47.798 --> 16:51.135
My mom, she's worked for Umbrella
ever since before I was born.

16:51.802 --> 16:54.638
So we've moved all over, and it sucks.

16:56.557 --> 16:57.850
Oh, I don't know, you just…

16:58.517 --> 16:59.893
find a way to make it work.

16:59.977 --> 17:03.313
You know, you have your sister,
and I have my parents.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.149
-Go for it. Do it.
-Go.

17:05.232 --> 17:06.734
And that's what really matters, right?

17:06.817 --> 17:07.735
Family.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.281
Shit, yeah.

17:12.364 --> 17:14.533
Go, go, go, go, go!

17:14.616 --> 17:16.368
You can do it.

17:39.558 --> 17:40.809
Jade.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.395
Jade.

18:32.861 --> 18:34.863
-This is date night?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.824
-Just find your Zen.
-"Find your Zen."

18:36.907 --> 18:39.785
-I…

18:46.125 --> 18:47.626
-I hate you.
-I know.

18:54.174 --> 18:55.676
Just… two seconds.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.302
Hey, it's fine.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.595
Your work is important.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.148
What?

19:09.731 --> 19:11.233
We got a breach on the network.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.652
-But surveillance grabbed a visual.

19:16.697 --> 19:17.781
You know him?

19:22.828 --> 19:23.745
I do.

20:16.673 --> 20:17.507
Billie?

21:08.642 --> 21:09.559
Are you dying?

21:10.102 --> 21:13.272
No, the, the bullet went straight through.
It just hurts like heck.

21:15.565 --> 21:17.401
-Thanks for worrying, though.
-Hoping.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.903
-I was hoping.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.488
So what are you looking at?

21:21.571 --> 21:24.199
The zeros, they're… working.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.369
Coordinated. It shouldn't be possible.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.163
Well, maybe the Brotherhood
trained them up.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.082
You know, with treats.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.084
Zeros aren't dogs.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.212
Their brain function's limited,
and… and with the virus,

21:37.296 --> 21:39.006
-it all becomes--
-Feed and breed.

21:39.089 --> 21:40.173
Exactly.

22:04.614 --> 22:07.409
-No, no, no!

22:08.618 --> 22:10.996
-Please! Please! No!
-That is never a good sign.

22:12.414 --> 22:15.917
No! No, no! No! Please, please. No!

22:16.001 --> 22:18.754
-No! No! You let go--

24:27.716 --> 24:28.842
Fuck.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.053
I think she's controlling them.

24:32.929 --> 24:35.390
-So?
-"So"? That's… that's organization.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.810
That's… It's higher brain function.
The… the virus is evolving.

24:39.769 --> 24:41.897
-I fucking knew it.
-Good for you.

24:41.980 --> 24:45.567
But me, I'm not looking to be fed
to evil grandma.

24:47.944 --> 24:48.904
Time to go.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.156
Fun fact.

24:51.239 --> 24:54.242
These cult freaks aren't so into
maintaining their hardware.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.579
Just call me…

24:57.662 --> 24:59.122
…"the master of unlocking".

25:00.916 --> 25:04.252
This is like, the easiest prison
I've ever broken out of.

25:05.712 --> 25:07.255
You were in?

25:07.339 --> 25:08.340
What did you do?

25:13.178 --> 25:14.304
What didn't I do?

25:29.194 --> 25:30.195
A little help?

25:35.450 --> 25:39.079
Look, if we get out of here,
I'll… I'll let you go, huh?

25:39.162 --> 25:40.705
I'll tell everyone that you're like…

25:41.456 --> 25:43.083
whatever. Dead.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.877
-And why should I believe you?
-Look, I'm shot.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.004
I almost got killed by brain monsters,

25:48.088 --> 25:50.173
and I've just had the crap
kicked out of me

25:50.257 --> 25:52.008
by a bunch of death metal groupies.

25:53.218 --> 25:56.388
I just want to go home,
and see my dogs, okay?

26:02.978 --> 26:03.979
Move.

26:11.194 --> 26:12.404
Another.

26:17.325 --> 26:19.452
You're never gonna get it from that angle.

26:19.536 --> 26:21.454
Well, maybe some spit will loosen it up.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.373
Said the priest to the choir boy.

26:24.040 --> 26:24.916
I was kidding.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.127
The priest wasn't.

26:27.210 --> 26:28.503
Hey. What are you doing?

26:28.587 --> 26:30.130
-Fucking hurry.

26:31.298 --> 26:32.173
Stop them.

26:39.556 --> 26:40.640
Whoa!

26:40.724 --> 26:41.683
All right.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.730
-Keys.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.565
Here. Hold this.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.154
Come on.

26:57.782 --> 26:58.825
Holy shit!

27:07.167 --> 27:08.376
Nice shot.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.419
Thank you.

27:20.513 --> 27:21.514
Gear up.

27:21.598 --> 27:22.432
You, go.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.567
I need a weapon.

27:34.444 --> 27:35.528
So get one.

27:39.949 --> 27:41.326
We don't have an exit.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.293
EMERGENCY RELEASE

27:50.377 --> 27:51.920
"Not-ent-ieg-elung"?

27:54.589 --> 27:57.050
The only word I know
in German is "Edelweiss".

27:58.385 --> 27:59.511
<i>Sound of Music.</i>

27:59.594 --> 28:00.512
Do something!

28:27.038 --> 28:27.872
Jade.

28:27.956 --> 28:28.832
Get behind me.

29:45.825 --> 29:48.203
Did you see that, Jade?

29:48.286 --> 29:50.079
Jade? Hello?

29:58.963 --> 30:00.507
<i>It's a block party, yo.</i>

30:01.132 --> 30:03.259
<i>We love every and each one of you.</i>

30:03.343 --> 30:07.180
<i>Thanks for coming out and supporting</i>
<i>local music and local artists.</i>

30:16.481 --> 30:17.398
Billie?

30:24.280 --> 30:25.615
Dude, chill.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.952
Shit! I thought you were…

30:29.035 --> 30:30.954
-Dead?

30:33.414 --> 30:34.749
Like you'd care.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.630
What are you talking about?

30:42.549 --> 30:44.801
All you care about
is hooking up with Simon.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.554
I mean, that's what you're doing, right?

30:49.722 --> 30:50.557
Look.

30:53.017 --> 30:53.935
I'm…

30:54.435 --> 30:55.311
whatever.

30:56.396 --> 30:57.313
Sick.

30:57.397 --> 31:00.316
-And you're just crushing on some dick.
-That's…

31:03.319 --> 31:05.196
-No.
-'Cause I might be dying.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.364
But you'll be fine.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.617
Maybe you'll be sad for a little.

31:11.411 --> 31:13.079
You, you'll… You'll get it over it.

31:15.748 --> 31:16.833
You won't miss me.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.378
-You know that's not true.
-No, my…

31:22.839 --> 31:23.882
My whole life…

31:28.177 --> 31:29.345
I'm not good at people.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.396
All I've ever had is you.

31:45.278 --> 31:46.279
But you?

31:46.779 --> 31:47.989
No, you don't need me.

31:49.532 --> 31:50.950
You never have.

31:51.701 --> 31:54.037
You're all about the fucking Jade show.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.330
-Billie.
-Don't.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.237
Hey, kid, kid.

32:28.321 --> 32:29.322
You know Jade Wesker?

32:30.323 --> 32:33.618
-Narc!
-Narc! Narc! Narc!

32:33.701 --> 32:34.869
-Narc.
-Go, go, go, go.

32:41.501 --> 32:42.543
What's happening?

32:43.753 --> 32:44.796
We need to go.

32:45.588 --> 32:47.340
We need to go, come on.

32:47.423 --> 32:48.466
Let's go.

32:52.887 --> 32:53.805
Come on.

32:54.764 --> 32:56.391
Hurry up. Come on.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.519
-Jade, seriously.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.066
Jade Wesker?

33:06.609 --> 33:07.819
Go. Down.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.292
Jade Wesker?

33:30.633 --> 33:31.759
We need to talk.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.525
The person who got bit, they're…

33:50.653 --> 33:51.779
they're in danger.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.202
I need your help.

33:58.286 --> 34:00.455
-I have to talk to you.
-What do you mean…

34:01.831 --> 34:02.874
"they're in danger"?

34:04.876 --> 34:06.002
You are Billie Wesker?

34:07.712 --> 34:08.755
How did you know her name?

34:11.257 --> 34:12.717
How did you find us?

34:14.510 --> 34:15.636
With this, okay?

34:21.851 --> 34:22.935
Who are you?

34:23.019 --> 34:24.103
He's the guy from online.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.774
-The one who said that if--
-If someone got bitten,

34:28.483 --> 34:31.027
-they go all psycho, yeah.
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.653
Not psycho, no.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.739
No, not psycho. The…

34:34.822 --> 34:36.240
The virus. Okay?

34:36.991 --> 34:39.494
The virus, it infects their brains.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.996
It turns its host into something…

34:44.957 --> 34:46.417
Something inhuman.

34:50.129 --> 34:51.047
You're lying.

34:51.589 --> 34:54.509
Why would I travel halfway
around the world just for a lie?

34:55.468 --> 34:57.220
I need to talk to the victim.

34:57.303 --> 34:58.805
I need to know who was attacked.

34:58.888 --> 34:59.972
Why?

35:00.056 --> 35:02.558
I interviewed him, I, I, I put it online.

35:02.642 --> 35:05.394
I prove what Umbrella's doing
because if I don't…

35:10.233 --> 35:12.568
Do you know what happened
to the first Raccoon City?

35:13.694 --> 35:15.863
There was some kind of gas leak,
a big fire or something.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.324
No, no, no, it was destroyed
by a nuclear blast.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.037
That…

35:23.121 --> 35:24.163
-No.
-Yeah.

35:25.665 --> 35:26.541
The virus?

35:27.375 --> 35:28.251
It got out.

35:29.043 --> 35:30.503
It infected hundreds.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.713
Thousands.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.550
So many that the US government
and Umbrella decided

35:35.633 --> 35:37.927
to burn it all down and cover it all up.

35:39.846 --> 35:43.015
And now,
if this is happening again…

35:44.809 --> 35:46.936
so many people will die.

35:50.773 --> 35:54.318
But before I can even go public,
I need proof.

35:54.402 --> 35:55.987
And that's why I'm here.

35:57.905 --> 35:59.407
I need to talk to the victim.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.493
And I need to talk to Albert Wesker.

36:02.577 --> 36:03.452
Why?

36:04.245 --> 36:05.746
Because he was there.

36:07.790 --> 36:09.750
Because he's supposed to be dead.

36:11.460 --> 36:14.255
Albert Wesker died in 2009.

36:18.384 --> 36:21.262
-You're fucking crazy.
-It's the truth.

36:21.345 --> 36:23.556
I've done my research on him.

36:25.099 --> 36:26.100
And on you.

36:27.977 --> 36:30.354
Do you know
there's no record you exist?

36:31.189 --> 36:36.152
No birth certificate,
no social security number, nothing.

36:36.235 --> 36:40.239
-Shut up.
-You have no idea how deep this goes.

36:40.323 --> 36:43.075
These, these people,
this story has brought nothing

36:43.159 --> 36:45.203
but suffering to my family. My…

36:47.163 --> 36:51.125
My father can barely look at me
and thinks I'm insane.

36:53.002 --> 36:58.758
Thousands, millions,
billions of lives are at stake.

37:00.009 --> 37:02.261
I need to know who is infected. Okay?

37:02.345 --> 37:03.346
Tell me. Tell me.

37:03.429 --> 37:05.097
-Tell me. Tell me.
-Get off.

37:07.850 --> 37:08.893
I…

37:11.020 --> 37:11.938
Go.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.827
-Right here.

37:26.911 --> 37:27.870
Right here, asshole.

37:28.704 --> 37:29.664
Hands up.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.708
Get in the car. Let's go.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.089
I know. Turn around.

37:38.923 --> 37:39.966
Let's go.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.141
Hey.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.271
That zero that you had chained up,

37:53.354 --> 37:55.815
the one controlling them
with that fucked-up thing on her neck.

37:56.357 --> 37:57.191
What is she?

37:57.275 --> 37:59.860
-We found her in the forest.
-What is she?

37:59.944 --> 38:01.070
<i>Leur reine.</i>

38:01.153 --> 38:02.321
Their queen.

38:19.505 --> 38:20.715
Fuck.

41:18.017 --> 41:19.268
<i>Hello?</i>

41:19.351 --> 41:20.394
Bea?

41:20.478 --> 41:21.479
<i>Hi, Mom.</i>

41:25.065 --> 41:25.941
I…

41:26.025 --> 41:27.026
<i>Are you okay?</i>

41:32.531 --> 41:33.491
Hey, Bea.

41:35.784 --> 41:37.119
-You know I lo--

41:41.332 --> 41:42.208
<i>Mom?</i>

41:44.376 --> 41:45.377
<i>Mom?</i>

41:46.921 --> 41:47.922
<i>Are you still there?</i>

41:49.340 --> 41:53.969
Bea, I want you to know
that everything I did…

41:55.095 --> 41:56.180
everything…

41:58.849 --> 41:59.975
it was for you.

42:01.018 --> 42:03.270
But I am so proud of you.

42:07.775 --> 42:08.984
It's you and me…

42:10.277 --> 42:11.362
always.

42:28.337 --> 42:29.547
Fuck it.

42:46.605 --> 42:48.440
Uh?

43:34.445 --> 43:36.280
Oh, god.

43:39.241 --> 43:40.242
Okay.

44:48.977 --> 44:50.145
Hey.

44:50.229 --> 44:51.355
You're alive.

44:51.438 --> 44:53.899
Good for you.
The, uh, tunnels are blocked.

44:53.982 --> 44:55.109
We need to get to the roof.

44:57.653 --> 44:58.904
I don't even want to know.

45:10.582 --> 45:11.667
I want the police.

45:12.668 --> 45:15.337
The South African police,
not the ones you own.

45:19.299 --> 45:21.260
We know who you are, Mr. Rubio.

45:21.343 --> 45:22.678
I've read your…

45:23.971 --> 45:24.888
blog.

45:25.597 --> 45:27.433
You're kind of obsessed with us.

45:28.100 --> 45:30.185
What happened to Susanna Franco
in Tijuana?

45:31.770 --> 45:33.939
After I interviewed her
about her husband, she…

45:35.441 --> 45:36.400
She disappeared.

45:37.067 --> 45:39.403
If I had to guess, she…

45:39.486 --> 45:41.947
…took the payout
from her husband's insurance,

45:42.030 --> 45:43.282
and moved somewhere beautiful.

45:44.366 --> 45:45.617
Far away from you.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.997
Is that what you want? To drop all this?

45:50.080 --> 45:51.415
I want the truth.

45:52.666 --> 45:53.751
"The truth."

45:55.002 --> 45:56.044
What does that even mean?

45:56.628 --> 45:58.464
You moved Joy, hmm?

45:59.047 --> 46:00.174
It's here now.

46:03.177 --> 46:04.386
How do you know that?

46:04.470 --> 46:07.347
Oh, the same way I know
something's gone wrong.

46:09.349 --> 46:10.559
Has it?

46:10.642 --> 46:12.644
One of your test animals got out.

46:14.062 --> 46:16.148
Again.

46:17.483 --> 46:19.359
You really need
to work on that, huh?

46:20.444 --> 46:21.361
And there's more.

46:23.822 --> 46:25.073
What kind of "more"?

46:26.283 --> 46:27.493
Oh, the bad kind.

46:30.162 --> 46:31.580
I can help you fix it.

46:35.334 --> 46:36.293
If you let me go.

47:14.873 --> 47:17.876
I'm shaking.

47:25.217 --> 47:26.426
Something's wrong.

47:28.595 --> 47:30.389
Come on, girls. Where are you?

47:33.392 --> 47:35.185
Wait. Will this get us to the roof?

47:35.269 --> 47:36.603
Only one way to find out.

47:43.944 --> 47:44.987
Look at my hands.

47:47.197 --> 47:48.198
It's happening.

47:52.411 --> 47:54.371
Fucking… pull me up.

47:57.332 --> 47:58.333
It's happening.

48:00.586 --> 48:01.670
It's happening.

48:08.176 --> 48:10.470
-Drop the bag, Jade.

48:10.554 --> 48:11.471
It's happening.

48:17.978 --> 48:19.354
Jade!

48:26.320 --> 48:27.404
Jade!

48:28.030 --> 48:31.158
-Jade, it's happening.
-No, it's not. No, it's not.

48:31.658 --> 48:33.201
Oh, fuck.

48:40.375 --> 48:41.376
Billie.

48:41.460 --> 48:43.003
-Billie.

48:43.086 --> 48:44.504
The timer went off five minutes ago.

49:18.246 --> 49:19.289
How do you feel?

49:21.833 --> 49:22.834
Fine.

49:25.921 --> 49:27.339
Oh, my god.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.636
I knew it. I knew he was a fucking liar.

49:38.517 --> 49:40.602
But

49:41.728 --> 49:42.562
I mean, Dad?

49:43.897 --> 49:45.315
You and me?

49:49.319 --> 49:50.821
You think that stuff's all fake, too?

49:51.613 --> 49:53.198

49:56.076 --> 49:57.452
Maybe, I…

50:00.580 --> 50:01.832
I don't know.
