WEBVTT

01:24.753 --> 01:26.337
ANYWAY, MISS BEADLE
DOESN'T THINK

01:26.504 --> 01:27.922
WE CAN UNDERSTAND
THE CIVIL WAR--

01:28.089 --> 01:29.549
I MEAN, REALLY
UNDERSTAND IT--

01:29.716 --> 01:32.218
BY JUST ACCEPTING
THE NORTH'S VERSION
OF WHAT HAPPENED.

01:32.385 --> 01:33.887
TWO SIDES
TO EVERY STORY, HUH?

01:34.053 --> 01:35.388
WELL, EACH SIDE
THOUGHT IT WAS RIGHT

01:35.555 --> 01:37.390
AND THE OTHER SIDE
WAS WRONG.

01:37.557 --> 01:40.101
MISS BEADLE SAYS IF
WE REALLY KNEW WHY--
ON BOTH SIDES--

01:40.268 --> 01:42.479
WE'LL GET TO REALLY SEE
HOW THE WAR HAPPENED.

AT THINGS.

01:44.105 --> 01:45.231
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:45.398 --> 01:47.442
I'M JUST NOT SO SURE
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

01:47.609 --> 01:49.402

BEEN OVER FOR 11 YEARS.

01:49.569 --> 01:51.780
YOU GOT FOLKS
SETTLING IN AROUND
HERE FROM BOTH SIDES.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.907

PRETTY HOT ON THE SUBJECT.

A GOOD CLASS PROJECT.

I'M CHARLES INGALLS.

03:16.656 --> 03:17.949
PLEASED TO KNOW YOU.

WE WERE DOING SOME
LAND SPECULATING
UP IN REDWOOD FALLS

03:20.159 --> 03:22.036
WHEN MR. HOBBS HERE
CAME DOWN WITH A FEVER.

03:22.203 --> 03:23.997
AS YOU CAN SEE,
REST IS NEEDED.

03:24.163 --> 03:25.790
THAT'S WHY WE STOPPED
HERE AT THE HOTEL.

03:25.957 --> 03:27.792
THE HOTEL IS FULL UP.

03:27.959 --> 03:30.336
THAT IS A PROBLEM.

03:30.503 --> 03:32.672
IS THERE ANOTHER HOTEL
OR A BOARDING HOUSE?

03:32.839 --> 03:36.426
NO, BUT I HAPPEN
TO BE THE AGENT FOR
A HOUSE FOR RENT.

03:36.593 --> 03:38.678

IF WE CAN MOVE IN
NOW, WE'LL TAKE IT.

03:38.845 --> 03:40.263

03:43.016 --> 03:45.518
WELL, YOU'RE LOOKING
MIGHTY SICKLY THERE,
MR. HOBBS.

RIGHT NOW,

THANK YOU VERY KINDLY,
BUT SWAMP FEVER IS

IS USED TO.

03:57.030 --> 03:58.364
UH, WE KNOW
HOW TO TREAT IT,

03:58.531 --> 03:59.741
AND THE DOCTOR COULDN'T
HELP VERY MUCH.

03:59.908 --> 04:01.951
IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF TIME AND REST.

OVER HERE. WE'LL TAKE
YOU OVER TO THE HOUSE.

CHARGE NEIGHBORS.

YOU GOT HIM ALL RIGHT?

04:27.852 --> 04:29.479

YEAH, I GOT HIM.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.736
Mary:
I'LL GET THE SHADES.

04:36.903 --> 04:38.029
Charles: ALL RIGHT.

04:38.196 --> 04:39.489
THE PLACE IS GOING TO
NEED A LITTLE CLEANING UP,

04:40.740 --> 04:42.283

FOR A WHILE.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.535
IT'S BIG,
BUT IT'LL DO FINE.

04:44.702 --> 04:46.245
I'LL JUST
GET THIS OFF.

04:46.412 --> 04:48.373
YEAH, THAT'S BETTER.

04:49.916 --> 04:52.001

BRINGING US UP HERE,
MR. INGALLS.

04:52.168 --> 04:54.212
OH, IT'S OUR PLEASURE.
ANYTHING ELSE
WE CAN DO FOR YOU?

04:54.379 --> 04:56.589
WELL, WE WILL BE
NEEDING TO LAY IN
SOME SUPPLIES.

04:56.756 --> 04:58.591
WELL, THE MERCANTILE'S
WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE.

04:58.758 --> 04:59.842
I'LL SHOW YOU
WHERE IT IS.

05:00.009 --> 05:01.344
UH, THAT BRINGS UP
A LITTLE PROBLEM.

05:01.511 --> 05:04.222
YOU SEE, THE FEVER
BRINGS ON CONVULSIONS,
AND, UH...

05:04.389 --> 05:06.057
WELL, I KNOW
JUST WHAT TO DO.

05:06.224 --> 05:07.725
UNTIL MR. HOBBS
IS BETTER,

05:07.892 --> 05:10.395
I DON'T THINK
IT'S WISE FOR ME
TO BE AWAY TOO LONG.

05:10.561 --> 05:13.523
THE IDEAL SOLUTION
WOULD BE TO HIRE SOMEBODY

05:13.690 --> 05:15.441
WHO COULD RUN
THE ERRANDS EVERY DAY,

05:15.608 --> 05:16.943
SOMEONE LIKE
YOUR DAUGHTER.

05:17.110 --> 05:18.945
WE COULD PAY HER
25 CENTS A DAY.

05:19.112 --> 05:20.863
OH, PA, COULD I?
PLEASE?

05:22.281 --> 05:24.200
SHE COULD ONLY
DO IT AFTER SCHOOL.

THAT'S FINE.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.953
ALL RIGHT.
10 CENTS A DAY

05:27.120 --> 05:28.663
IS PLENTY FOR
RUNNING ERRANDS.

05:28.830 --> 05:30.206

05:30.373 --> 05:31.708
DEAL!

GET 'EM STARTED.

AT 10 CENTS A DAY,

05:38.589 --> 05:41.467

TO MAKE THAT DRESS IN 5 DAYS.

WANT ME ON SATURDAYS?

DON'T KNOW.

SEE A DOCTOR.

PUZZLES ME A BIT.

WITHOUT BEING RECOGNIZED,
AFTER THIS LEG HEALS UP,

07:24.195 --> 07:25.696
WE CAN HEAD OUT

20:10.752 --> 20:12.129
THAT THE JAMES BROTHERS

20:12.296 --> 20:16.341
ARE HOLED UP SOMEWHERE
IN THIS PART OF THE STATE.

20:16.508 --> 20:17.718
YOU A SHERIFF?

20:17.885 --> 20:21.013
WELL, IN A WAY.
WE'RE BOUNTY HUNTERS.

20:21.179 --> 20:24.766
THERE'S A GOOD REWARD
OUT FOR THEM TWO.

20:27.019 --> 20:29.813
FOLKS DON'T LOOK TOO KINDLY
ON BOUNTY HUNTERS,

20:29.980 --> 20:34.067
BUT, UH...WE SAVE
ALL YOU TAXPAYERS
A LOT OF MONEY.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.069
HOW DO YOU
FIGURE THAT?

20:36.236 --> 20:38.238
WELL,

BEFORE THE LAW DOES,
THERE'S NO TRIAL.

20:42.117 --> 20:44.620

IF YOU GET MY MEANING.

20:44.786 --> 20:46.079
YEAH, WE GET
YOUR MEANING,

20:46.246 --> 20:47.956
BUT WE HAVEN'T
SEEN ANYBODY
AROUND HERE

20:48.123 --> 20:49.750

EXCEPT YOU.

THEY'RE HIDING OUT.

WEAPONS UNLESS THEY HAD TO.

20:53.712 --> 20:55.547
HERE'S SOME POSTERS.

20:55.714 --> 20:59.718

WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.

WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
SOMETHING?

BOUNTY HUNTERS

21:37.881 --> 21:39.257
SHOOT 'EM DOWN
IN COLD BLOOD?

21:39.424 --> 21:41.760
THAT'S AS BAD
AS ANYTHING THE
JAMES BOYS EVER DID.

21:41.927 --> 21:43.136

21:43.303 --> 21:45.055

I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHY I CAN'T GO ON

22:38.525 --> 22:40.485
CAN'T YOU EVEN
TELL ME WHY?

22:40.652 --> 22:41.945
YES, BUT NOT NOW.

22:42.112 --> 22:43.947

YES.

WE'RE ALL IN
AGREEMENT, THEN?

23:18.857 --> 23:21.234
ONE OF US WILL GO TO
MANKATO AND NOTIFY
THE MARSHAL THERE.

23:21.401 --> 23:22.736
I'LL MAKE THE TRIP.

23:22.903 --> 23:24.529
FINE. I WANT TO ADD,

RIGHT TO THE POINT.

A TOWN MEETING.

24:42.941 --> 24:43.984
A TOWN MEETING?

24:44.151 --> 24:45.902
YES. I THINK YOU'D
GET MAXIMUM RESULTS

24:46.069 --> 24:48.613

SEE EVERYONE.

TO GET HOME.

TO BE THE DECISION

OF THIS COMMUNITY,
NOT JUST OURS.

AT THE CHURCH EARLY

25:48.673 --> 25:50.884

AMONG OURSELVES.

THERE'S A SMALL CHANCE

THAT THAT POSSE MIGHT
JUST BE PASSING THROUGH

ALL RIGHT. STAY LOW.

33:43.064 --> 33:45.066
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

33:45.233 --> 33:47.527
WELL, I-I'M JUST
HEADING OVER
TO MY HOUSE HERE.

33:47.694 --> 33:49.570
BRODER SAYS
NOBODY LEAVES TOWN.

33:49.737 --> 33:51.948
WELL, I ONLY
LIVE DOWN HERE

33:52.115 --> 33:54.826
A LITTLE BIT,
AND MY WIFE AIN'T
FEELING GOOD.

33:54.992 --> 33:56.661
I WAS JUST GONNA
CHECK ON HER.

33:56.828 --> 33:59.205
NOBODY LEAVES TOWN.

33:59.372 --> 34:01.332
NOBODY, HUH?

34:21.519 --> 34:22.645
A HOSTAGE IS NO GOOD

34:22.812 --> 34:25.815
UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING
TO KILL THAT HOSTAGE.

34:27.483 --> 34:29.777
ARE YOU WILLING
TO DO THAT?

34:32.196 --> 34:33.823
WE HAVE TO BE.

34:41.205 --> 34:42.623
IT IS THE ANNOUNCED
INTENTION

34:42.790 --> 34:44.542
OF THAT POSSE
TO EXECUTE THOSE MEN--

34:44.709 --> 34:46.252
NOW, HOLD IT!

34:46.419 --> 34:50.381
DID ANY OF THE FOLKS
THAT THEY SLAUGHTERED
EVER GET A FAIR TRIAL?

34:50.548 --> 34:52.592
YOU CAN ALL DO
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO!

34:52.759 --> 34:54.927
BUT I'M GOING TO TELL
THAT POSSE THE TRUTH!

34:55.094 --> 34:56.387
NO, YOU AIN'T.

34:56.554 --> 34:58.097
YOU GET OUT OF
MY WAY, GARVEY!

34:58.264 --> 34:59.515
NOW, HOLD ON HERE!

34:59.682 --> 35:00.892
WE AIN'T JUST
TALKING ABOUT

35:01.058 --> 35:03.102
THE FINE POINTS OF RIGHT
AND WRONG ANYMORE.

35:03.269 --> 35:06.647
THE JAMES BOYS IS HOLDING
MARY INGALLS HOSTAGE...

35:06.814 --> 35:11.027
AND WE CAN'T SAY NOTHING,
OR THEY MIGHT KILL HER.

35:21.412 --> 35:23.915
Ford: WELL,
I'M TELLING YOU...

35:24.081 --> 35:27.126
I'M AGAINST THIS!

35:27.293 --> 35:29.587
I'M SORRY FOR
THE INGALLS GIRL, BUT--

35:29.754 --> 35:30.755
LEWIS FORD!

35:30.922 --> 35:32.548
IS YOUR MIND
SO CLUTTERED WITH HATE

35:32.715 --> 35:34.926
THAT YOU AIN'T PICKED UP
ON NOTHIN' I SAID?

35:35.092 --> 35:38.095
IF WE DON'T KEEP
THEM BOUNTY HUNTERS
AWAY FROM HERE,

35:38.262 --> 35:39.972
MARY INGALLS
MAY BE KILLED!

35:40.139 --> 35:41.349
YOU KEEP
YOUR MOUTH SHUT!

35:41.516 --> 35:43.392
Hanson: <i>JA,</i>AND YOU
KEEP IT TIGHT SHUT, TOO!

35:43.559 --> 35:45.061
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'RE GETTING
TIRED OF YOU.

35:45.228 --> 35:46.687
DON'T YOU INTERFERE
WITH THIS!

35:46.854 --> 35:48.314
[SHOUTING] I WOULD
LIKE TO STATE

35:48.481 --> 35:50.399
THAT AS MINISTER OF
THIS CONGREGATION,

35:50.566 --> 35:52.527
I WILL CONDONE
ANY ACT,

35:52.693 --> 35:54.612
ANY STATEMENT,

35:54.779 --> 35:58.449
DESIGNED TO
PROTECT THE LIFE
OF MARY INGALLS!

35:58.616 --> 36:01.577
NOW, MAY GOD FORGIVE
ME IF I'M WRONG,

36:01.744 --> 36:03.538
BUT UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

36:03.704 --> 36:05.456
THAT'S THE LEAST
I CAN DO!

36:05.623 --> 36:09.252
NOW, WE WILL
UNITE AND BE ONE
IN THIS IF WE--

36:15.591 --> 36:18.261
YOU FINISH UP, PASTOR.
I CAN WAIT.

36:18.427 --> 36:19.804
MISTER, UH...

36:19.971 --> 36:22.640
BRODER IS THE NAME,
PASTOR.

36:22.807 --> 36:24.767
MR. BRODER...

36:24.934 --> 36:27.854
THIS IS ONLY
A TOWN MEETING,

36:28.020 --> 36:31.649
BUT IT IS BEING HELD
IN THE HOUSE OF GOD.

36:31.816 --> 36:34.735
OH, SURE WOULDN'T WANT
TO SHOW DISRESPECT

36:34.902 --> 36:37.113
IN THE HOUSE OF GOD.

36:43.452 --> 36:45.705
LET'S GET DOWN TO CASES.

36:47.164 --> 36:48.666
EVEN THOUGH A WITNESS

36:48.833 --> 36:50.751
POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED
FRANK AND JESSE JAMES

36:50.918 --> 36:53.838
AS GETTING OFF THAT
STAGE HERE LAST WEEK,

36:54.005 --> 36:58.175
NOBODY I TALKED TO
SEEMED TO REMEMBER.

36:58.342 --> 37:01.220
AND MAYBE THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE THEY
DIDN'T REMEMBER,

37:01.387 --> 37:05.892
AND THAT IS TO TELL YOU
THERE'S A $5,000 REWARD

37:06.058 --> 37:09.061
FOR INFORMATION LEADING
TO THE APPREHENSION

37:09.228 --> 37:12.857
OF THESE CRIMINALS--
HALF OF IT TO THE PERSON

37:13.024 --> 37:16.319
THAT SHOWS ME WHERE
THEY'RE HOLED UP.

37:21.490 --> 37:25.870
THESE ARE THE MEN
IDENTIFIED AS ARRIVING
IN WALNUT GROVE.

37:28.331 --> 37:30.207
PASS IT AMONG YOU.

37:30.374 --> 37:32.293
LOOK CLOSE.

37:35.087 --> 37:37.006
TAKE YOUR TIME.

37:44.138 --> 37:46.182
[CHARLES PANTING]

37:48.601 --> 37:50.603
THAT'LL BE FAR ENOUGH.

37:52.521 --> 37:53.606
MY DAUGHTER.

37:53.773 --> 37:55.316
SHE'S HERE.

37:55.483 --> 37:57.944
HAD TO KEEP HER.

37:58.110 --> 37:59.987
SEEN THE POSSE.

38:00.154 --> 38:02.406
LOOK, SHE'S JUST A
LITTLE GIRL. LET HER GO.

38:02.573 --> 38:04.033
YOU CAN KEEP ME INSTEAD.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.410
THAT'S AN INTERESTING
PROPOSITION,
MR. INGALLS,

38:06.577 --> 38:08.579
BUT IT WON'T
BE NECESSARY.

38:08.746 --> 38:11.415
WE'RE GOING TO HOLD
BOTH OF YOU.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.461
COME ON.

38:49.620 --> 38:51.956
Broder: NOTHING
AT ALL TO SAY?

38:52.123 --> 38:54.000
NOT ANY OF YOU?

38:59.213 --> 39:01.007
Reverend: WELL,
THEN, MR. BRODER,

39:01.173 --> 39:03.634
DOES THAT ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION?

39:03.801 --> 39:05.594
OH, YES, PASTOR.

39:05.761 --> 39:08.639
THAT ANSWERS MORE
THAN MY QUESTION.

39:08.806 --> 39:11.517
[SCOFFS]
HOUSE OF GOD.

39:12.643 --> 39:14.812
HOUSE OF GOD?

39:14.979 --> 39:18.774
THIS IS A HOUSE
OF LIARS!

39:20.109 --> 39:23.070
YOU ARE ALL LIARS!

39:26.490 --> 39:29.744
WE ARE ALL LIARS.

39:29.910 --> 39:31.954
ALL OF US.

39:37.501 --> 39:38.711
I'LL TELL YOU--

39:38.878 --> 39:39.920
NO!

39:40.087 --> 39:42.339
ANYBODY GOING TO
CLAIM THAT REWARD,

39:42.506 --> 39:43.758
IT'S GOING TO BE ME!

39:43.924 --> 39:45.009
Doc Baker:
JONATHAN!

39:45.176 --> 39:48.012
NO! STAY OUT OF IT, DOC!
THESE ARE LAWMEN.

39:48.179 --> 39:50.347
ALL RIGHT, SON, WHERE
ARE THEY HIDING OUT?

39:50.514 --> 39:51.807
I'LL TAKE YOU THERE,

39:51.974 --> 39:53.350
BUT THEY GOT
A YOUNG GIRL IN THERE.

39:53.517 --> 39:55.519
YOU GOT TO PROMISE
SHE WON'T BE HURT.

39:55.686 --> 39:56.687
OH, AGREED.

39:56.854 --> 39:59.190
YOU'RE GUARANTEEING ME
HALF OF THAT $5,000?

39:59.356 --> 40:01.317
OH, I DO, SIR.

40:01.484 --> 40:04.278
YOU GET THAT
CHURCH BELL RINGING.

40:11.368 --> 40:13.579
[BELL RINGING]

40:30.721 --> 40:32.473
Jonathan: AIN'T GONNA
NEED THEM HORSES.

40:32.640 --> 40:34.100
YOU JUST SHOW US WHERE
THEY'RE HIDING OUT.

40:34.266 --> 40:36.393
WE'LL DECIDE WHETHER
WE NEED HORSES OR NOT.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.229
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

40:59.333 --> 41:01.585
Jonathan, whispering:
Shh. Quiet.

41:04.964 --> 41:06.841
Quiet, now.

41:18.018 --> 41:20.271
THAT'S WHERE
THEY'RE HOLED UP.

41:41.083 --> 41:42.918
UNLESS YOU WANT
TO JOIN US,

41:43.085 --> 41:45.296
YOU BETTER
HEAD FOR TOWN.

41:59.059 --> 42:00.186
SLADE...

42:00.352 --> 42:02.688
COVER THE BACK.

42:05.316 --> 42:06.400
[GUN COCKS]

42:06.567 --> 42:10.487
Broder: FRANK! JESSE!
WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!

42:10.654 --> 42:13.657
YOU GOT ONE CHANCE...
AND ONLY ONE.

42:13.824 --> 42:17.745
YOU GOT 5 SECONDS
TO COME OUT!

42:17.912 --> 42:21.332
1...2...

42:21.498 --> 42:22.625
3...

42:22.791 --> 42:24.168
[GUNS COCK]

42:24.335 --> 42:25.252
FIRE!

42:25.419 --> 42:27.504
[GUNFIRE]

42:42.353 --> 42:43.646
I SPOOKED THE HORSES!

42:43.812 --> 42:46.273
GET THEM WAGONS
OUT OF TOWN!

42:46.440 --> 42:48.901
Man: COME ON,
LET'S GO! MOVE!

42:52.655 --> 42:54.073
CEASE FIRE!

42:57.534 --> 43:00.704
SLADE. TAKE A LOOK!

43:15.511 --> 43:17.179
NOBODY! NOTHIN'!

43:17.346 --> 43:20.641
AIN'T EVEN A STICK
OF FURNITURE IN THERE!

43:23.352 --> 43:25.479
[HORSES WHINNYING]

43:51.964 --> 43:53.924
ALL RIGHT,
ALL OF YOU...

43:54.091 --> 43:56.635
WE GOT SOME
HORSE TRACKING TO DO.

44:07.104 --> 44:08.856
I'M SORRY, MARY.

44:09.023 --> 44:12.526
I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE ONLY CHANCE WE HAD.

44:15.904 --> 44:17.614
LISTEN,
IF I WAS YOU TWO,

44:17.781 --> 44:21.076
I'D BE RIDING
WHILE I STILL
HAD A SKIN ON.

44:21.243 --> 44:22.369
LET'S GO, FRANK.

44:22.536 --> 44:24.413
COME ON. COME ON!

44:36.508 --> 44:38.344
THANK YOU, JONATHAN.

44:44.767 --> 44:47.644
NO SIGN OF
A THING, BOSS.

45:01.116 --> 45:03.327
YOU GOT PLENTY TO
ANSWER FOR, MISTER.

45:03.494 --> 45:05.829
FOR WHAT? TRYING TO
SAVE YOUR HORSES?

45:05.996 --> 45:08.540
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

45:08.707 --> 45:10.000
ALL THAT SHOOTING UP THERE

45:10.167 --> 45:11.835
SPOOKED THEM HORSES
SOMETHING TERRIBLE,

45:12.002 --> 45:13.170
AND ME AND CHARLES,

45:13.337 --> 45:15.839
WE HAD A HORRIBLE TIME
TRYING TO RUN THEM DOWN.

45:16.006 --> 45:16.965
HE'S RIGHT.

45:17.132 --> 45:19.009
THEY ALL OUTRAN US
EXCEPT THAT ONE.

45:19.176 --> 45:21.470
HAD TO CHASE HIM
ALL THE WAY TO MY PLACE.

45:21.637 --> 45:23.514
THIS HERE'S
THE ONLY ONE WE FOUND,

45:23.680 --> 45:25.641
BUT THE REST OF THEM
ARE PROBABLY JUST OUT THERE

45:25.808 --> 45:27.976
GRAZING IN THE HILLS.

45:37.486 --> 45:39.822
OH, UH, BRODER...

45:39.988 --> 45:42.616
YOU GOT THEM OUTLAWS,
DIDN'T YOU?

46:34.251 --> 46:39.423
WE'VE COME THROUGH A TIME
OF TRIAL AND DECISION.

46:41.467 --> 46:45.846
THOSE OF US THAT WERE
A PART OF IT...

46:46.889 --> 46:50.100
WILL LONG WONDER
IF WE DID THE RIGHT THING,

46:50.267 --> 46:53.145
LETTING THOSE TWO WHO
WERE BRIEFLY IN OUR MIDST

46:53.312 --> 46:57.733
ESCAPE THE...
DRUMHEAD COURT...

46:58.775 --> 47:01.612
AND THE TERRIBLE
TERMINATION OF LIFE.

47:03.739 --> 47:06.241
OR WERE WE ENTIRELY WRONG?

47:09.453 --> 47:10.913
EACH OF THOSE INVOLVED

47:11.079 --> 47:13.123
IS GOING TO HAVE
TO MAKE HIS OWN PEACE

47:13.290 --> 47:15.042
WITH HIS CONSCIENCE...

47:17.836 --> 47:19.838
AND WITH GOD.

47:21.256 --> 47:27.012
TOWARD THAT END,
LET'S ALL JOIN IN SILENT PRAYER.

47:43.820 --> 47:46.323
Mary, voice-over:
THE JAMES BROTHERS

47:46.490 --> 47:47.991
MADE GOOD THEIR ESCAPE,

47:48.158 --> 47:50.869
AND NONE OF US
EVER SAW THEM AGAIN...

47:51.036 --> 47:53.247
EXCEPT BOBBY FORD,

47:53.413 --> 47:56.333
WHO WOULD SEE JESSE
ON ANOTHER DAY--

47:56.500 --> 47:58.085
HIS LAST DAY,

47:58.252 --> 48:00.379
6 YEARS LATER.
