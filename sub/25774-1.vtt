♫ As I went down in the river to pray

00:12.135 --> 00:16.302
♫ Studyin' about that good
ol' way and who shall wear

00:17.582 --> 00:21.749
♫ The starry crown good
lord show me the way

00:25.585 --> 00:28.429
I was originally born in Grafton,

00:28.429 --> 00:32.231
taken from Grafton to
Cootamundra Girls' Home

00:32.231 --> 00:33.564
when I was four.

00:35.595 --> 00:37.012
I don't know why.

00:40.953 --> 00:44.245
It's not clear to me
where I'm originally from.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.595
I know I'm from up there somewhere

00:46.595 --> 00:50.762
Up the Bundjalung tribe,
that's what I was told.

00:51.151 --> 00:53.568
I'm still tryin' to find out.

00:55.154 --> 00:58.562
Not really important to me it's not.

00:58.562 --> 01:02.268
'Cause I was too much
in the institutions.

01:02.268 --> 01:06.415
♫ Oh sister let's go down

01:06.415 --> 01:10.500
I was three and a half years old.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.166
Being so young as I was,

01:12.166 --> 01:15.730
I thought this was natural to be abused

01:15.730 --> 01:17.618
you know and thrown in the box room

01:17.618 --> 01:19.988
and whipped and things like that.

01:19.988 --> 01:24.155
♫ The starry crown good
lord show me the way

01:24.946 --> 01:26.612
Be a domestic service

01:26.612 --> 01:28.600
to be workin' in a white person's house

01:28.600 --> 01:30.539
to do their cleaning and their washing

01:30.539 --> 01:32.573
and lookin' after their kids

01:32.573 --> 01:35.073
and that's what we were doing.

01:36.065 --> 01:37.536
It was just literally a slave,

01:37.536 --> 01:41.703
to be there to do their bit
of what they wanted you to do.

01:42.947 --> 01:46.739
♫ As I went down in the river to pray

01:46.739 --> 01:48.807
We were like dogs,

01:48.807 --> 01:52.183
just given the rubbish you know?

01:52.183 --> 01:53.683
Had the leftovers.

01:56.625 --> 02:00.708
Hurts, to think what the
wealthy have done to us.

02:03.086 --> 02:05.253
Pain that we went through.

02:08.176 --> 02:11.094
I still have nightmares.

02:14.915 --> 02:17.895
♫ Oh sisters lets go down

02:17.895 --> 02:21.808
♫ Lets go down, come on down

02:21.808 --> 02:25.392
♫ Oh sisters lets go down

02:39.346 --> 02:43.513
In 1901,
Australia became a federation.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.990
Under the new constitution,

02:45.990 --> 02:50.012
aboriginal people would not
be counted in the census.

02:50.012 --> 02:52.771
And the commonwealth would
have the power to make laws

02:52.771 --> 02:56.526
relating to any race
of people in Australia,

02:56.526 --> 02:58.609
except aboriginal people.

03:01.704 --> 03:04.757
The federated states
retained exclusive power

03:04.757 --> 03:08.283
over aboriginal affairs until 1967

03:08.283 --> 03:12.450
when the constitution was
amended in a historic referendum.

03:12.830 --> 03:14.830
When Australian's voted overwhelmingly

03:14.830 --> 03:18.080
to change these discriminatory clauses.

03:20.096 --> 03:23.438
Aboriginal people had been
subject to oppressive legislation

03:23.438 --> 03:26.382
that varied on a state by state basis

03:26.382 --> 03:28.632
from the late 19th century.

03:31.161 --> 03:33.683
The notorious aborigines protection board

03:33.683 --> 03:36.278
had the power to forcibly move people

03:36.278 --> 03:39.915
from their traditional lands,
onto reserves and missions

03:39.915 --> 03:42.949
and to remove children from their families

03:42.949 --> 03:46.199
and power over their financial affairs.

03:47.065 --> 03:48.632
The policy of protection,

03:48.632 --> 03:52.364
of smoothing the dying
pillow of a doomed race,

03:52.364 --> 03:55.603
rapidly changed to one of control.

03:55.603 --> 03:58.436
With the end game of assimilation.

04:00.903 --> 04:02.591
Certainly when the pieces of legislation

04:02.591 --> 04:04.877
were first drafted in the late 1880s

04:04.877 --> 04:07.089
through to the early 1900s,

04:07.089 --> 04:09.063
what you do see is a reflection

04:09.063 --> 04:11.066
of this generally held assumption

04:11.066 --> 04:14.088
by the dominant culture in Australia

04:14.088 --> 04:17.505
that aboriginal people were a dying race.

04:18.462 --> 04:21.361
By the time you get to the 40s, 50s, 60s

04:21.361 --> 04:22.803
and it's very clear

04:22.803 --> 04:25.829
that the aboriginal
population isn't dying out.

04:25.829 --> 04:28.921
The impetus behind the
concept of protection

04:28.921 --> 04:30.838
becomes very different.

04:32.009 --> 04:35.434
You do find a large
sort of broad similarity

04:35.434 --> 04:37.628
in terms of the assumptions about

04:37.628 --> 04:39.899
inferiority of aboriginal people,

04:39.899 --> 04:42.635
the problems that were assumed to exist

04:42.635 --> 04:44.918
or would be created if aboriginal children

04:44.918 --> 04:46.944
were left with their families.

04:46.944 --> 04:49.641
The importance of seeing assimilation

04:49.641 --> 04:53.603
of aboriginal people as a key
way of progressing forward

04:53.603 --> 04:56.754
in terms of federal government policy.

04:56.754 --> 05:00.074
All of those sorts of
big ideological pictures

05:00.074 --> 05:04.241
were pretty much existent
across the board.

05:20.923 --> 05:23.756
I was born in Brewarrina.

05:24.780 --> 05:27.117
I didn't know my father

05:27.117 --> 05:30.037
but I had a step father who I really loved

05:30.037 --> 05:32.787
who was the only dad that I knew.

05:36.974 --> 05:39.301
We was playing outside in the dirt

05:39.301 --> 05:40.801
with our roly poly

05:42.785 --> 05:44.223
and then while mom

05:44.223 --> 05:48.390
and all the other ladies
were playing cards inside,

05:49.117 --> 05:52.450
black car come there, just parked there.

05:55.351 --> 05:57.684
Jenny she had me by the hand

05:59.076 --> 06:00.659
and hanged onto me.

06:02.210 --> 06:06.377
And the welfare fella just
picked us up and took us.

06:08.388 --> 06:10.721
Took us and mom didn't know.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.343
- There was certainly an assumption

06:19.343 --> 06:21.004
that the best time to remove children

06:21.004 --> 06:23.661
was the youngest you
could possibly get them

06:23.661 --> 06:26.157
so there were lots of instances where

06:26.157 --> 06:28.668
aboriginal women would go into hospital,

06:28.668 --> 06:30.515
would be told their children had died

06:30.515 --> 06:34.682
and then later find out that
they'd been adopted out.

06:35.379 --> 06:38.244
There was a view that if
children were institutionalised

06:38.244 --> 06:40.159
or sent out to work,

06:40.159 --> 06:42.279
somehow these would be better ways

06:42.279 --> 06:44.988
of equipping them for life in white world

06:44.988 --> 06:47.637
then allowing them to
stay with their families.

06:58.449 --> 07:00.300
- Well I was born at Peak Hill,

07:00.300 --> 07:02.133
in Peak Hill hospital.

07:03.995 --> 07:04.828
In 1932.

07:06.653 --> 07:08.325
That's a long time ago.

07:10.530 --> 07:11.363
Yeah no,

07:13.706 --> 07:17.490
you'd see me out on the
mission there at Peak Hill

07:17.490 --> 07:18.850
with mom and dad.

07:18.850 --> 07:22.888
Well that's where we
was taken' from there.

07:26.026 --> 07:28.802
I remember we was playin' out on the lawn

07:28.802 --> 07:31.504
out the front of the courthouse

07:31.504 --> 07:33.741
and that's where mom and dad walked away

07:33.741 --> 07:35.241
and left us there.

07:36.297 --> 07:38.303
I don't think they knew where I was going,

07:38.303 --> 07:39.256
I was only little,

07:39.256 --> 07:41.208
I didn't know whether they knew or not

07:41.208 --> 07:42.791
but we didn't know.

07:44.352 --> 07:47.495
I was only little, tiny kid.

07:47.495 --> 07:50.745
Train ride and ended up at Cootamundra.

08:03.368 --> 08:06.366
In 1911,
the Cootamundra Domestic

08:06.366 --> 08:08.389
Training Home for aboriginal girls

08:08.389 --> 08:11.565
was opened by the
Aborigine's Protection Board,

08:11.565 --> 08:13.898
in Country, New South Wales.

08:16.413 --> 08:20.580
Until it closed in 1968,
hundreds of aboriginal girls

08:20.604 --> 08:22.471
were placed in the home,

08:22.471 --> 08:26.471
after being forcibly
removed from their parents.

08:30.509 --> 08:33.970
The idea was to segregate
part aboriginal children

08:33.970 --> 08:35.470
from their families,

08:35.470 --> 08:38.791
in order to assimilate them
into the mainstream community

08:38.791 --> 08:40.541
as domestic servants.

08:42.854 --> 08:44.427
- Matron called out and said,

08:44.427 --> 08:46.722
"now girls, this is your new home.

08:46.722 --> 08:49.314
"You behave yourself
and do as you're told,

08:49.314 --> 08:50.555
"things will be alright."

08:50.555 --> 08:51.481
And that's what she said.

08:51.481 --> 08:55.148
They never told us why
we were taken, never.

08:57.355 --> 08:59.537
- I went to Bomaderry Children's Home ,

08:59.537 --> 09:03.037
I was aged two with the other two sisters.

09:04.568 --> 09:06.861
And when I went to Cootamundra,

09:06.861 --> 09:09.593
about nine with me other sister Patty,

09:09.593 --> 09:12.567
they said we were gonna
meet me eldest sisters

09:12.567 --> 09:14.518
and I didn't even know we had 'em.

09:14.518 --> 09:17.287
Only family I knew was the Bomaderry kids

09:17.287 --> 09:21.370
and the ones in Cootamundra,
they seemed strange.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.782
I wasn't brought up with them.

09:25.782 --> 09:27.726
If you're not brought up with someone,

09:27.726 --> 09:29.559
how could you connect?

09:33.975 --> 09:35.995
The story
of private John Wenberg

09:35.995 --> 09:39.044
of the second AIF and his wife Lily

09:39.044 --> 09:41.627
is one shared by many families.

09:43.413 --> 09:45.134
All nine of their children

09:45.134 --> 09:48.692
including sisters
Adelaide, Valerie and Rita

09:48.692 --> 09:50.442
were taken from them.

09:51.348 --> 09:53.994
Some were taken before
their younger siblings

09:53.994 --> 09:55.577
had even been born.

09:57.521 --> 10:01.688
Two of their children, Dorothy
and John died of neglect

10:01.860 --> 10:03.943
while wards of the state.

10:07.728 --> 10:09.604
Despite their repeated pleas

10:09.604 --> 10:11.407
for the return of their children,

10:11.407 --> 10:13.654
John and Lily were formally advised

10:13.654 --> 10:15.423
that the removal of their children

10:15.423 --> 10:18.590
was justified due to parental neglect.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.443
- I got in the home when
I was three and a half.

10:26.443 --> 10:30.345
Grew up, grew up not knowing
they were my sisters.

10:30.345 --> 10:33.012
And grew up not wanting to know.

10:36.974 --> 10:39.474
You know, we're not close now.

10:40.339 --> 10:41.672
We're strangers.

10:42.614 --> 10:46.114
Same with our brothers,
they're strangers.

11:10.447 --> 11:12.592
I was more or less on me own

11:12.592 --> 11:15.135
amongst about 45 girls or more.

11:15.135 --> 11:17.961
All in the same position
I think that I was in.

11:17.961 --> 11:22.128
Taken and just put there,
for the reasons unknown.

11:23.313 --> 11:24.571
I was a real devil then,

11:24.571 --> 11:27.056
I just wouldn't settle down to do nothin'.

11:27.056 --> 11:28.404
'Cause I had an idea in my head

11:28.404 --> 11:31.154
that I shouldn't have been there.

11:32.219 --> 11:33.598
You know when you wake up in the morning

11:33.598 --> 11:34.572
and you think you're gonna wake up

11:34.572 --> 11:37.473
and see your mom and dad and you don't,

11:37.473 --> 11:39.245
you wake up and you're
in a dormitory with about

11:39.245 --> 11:42.245
14 or 15 other kids, all age groups,

11:45.117 --> 11:47.200
it's not very comforting.

11:48.308 --> 11:51.587
- When you became a women you know,

11:51.587 --> 11:53.169
you got your periods.

11:53.169 --> 11:55.315
I didn't know what was going on.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.764
I was down the toilet, I saw blood,

11:56.764 --> 11:58.271
"oh shit what's happened here"?

11:58.271 --> 12:00.166
And went up to the matron and,

12:00.166 --> 12:01.915
"Oh Adelaide," she said.

12:01.915 --> 12:03.743
"You're turning into a women."

12:03.743 --> 12:05.830
And all she did was
handin' me these things,

12:05.830 --> 12:07.791
you have to wash yourself
and that you know?

12:07.791 --> 12:10.032
So shit what's goin' on here you know?

12:10.032 --> 12:12.016
That's all we were told, nothing.

12:12.016 --> 12:16.183
There was no love up there,
none whatsoever, none.

12:22.376 --> 12:25.729
In 1948, an
Anglican missionary couple

12:25.729 --> 12:28.121
established the Marella Mission Farm

12:28.121 --> 12:29.888
known as the Hidden Mission,

12:29.888 --> 12:33.247
to accommodate aboriginal
children on their private property

12:33.247 --> 12:36.247
in a north western suburb of Sydney.

12:40.023 --> 12:43.194
The first child arrived in 1953

12:43.194 --> 12:45.734
and the subsequent hundreds of children

12:45.734 --> 12:49.535
who passed through their gates
became an unpaid labour force

12:49.535 --> 12:51.357
that supported the farm,

12:51.357 --> 12:53.830
which already benefited
from government funding

12:53.830 --> 12:55.580
and public donations.

12:59.626 --> 13:03.452
Soon after being taken from
her family at the age of two,

13:03.452 --> 13:07.075
Rita Wright was transferred
form the Cootamundra girls home

13:07.075 --> 13:11.242
to Marella where she remained
until she was released

13:11.604 --> 13:12.437
aged 19.

13:17.039 --> 13:20.828
- I hate that place, I hate the name.

13:20.828 --> 13:22.564
I used to steal oranges off the tree

13:22.564 --> 13:25.481
and hide 'em under the floorboards.

13:26.332 --> 13:28.347
And then they'd make us
start readin' the bible,

13:28.347 --> 13:30.487
"thou shalt not steal," you know?

13:30.487 --> 13:32.217
Like you have to steal to survive,

13:32.217 --> 13:33.381
just to have a feed you know?

13:33.381 --> 13:34.631
We were hungry.

13:37.013 --> 13:39.346
We were treated like slaves.

13:40.279 --> 13:41.491
Done all the work.

13:41.491 --> 13:43.985
We kept a dirty farm goin'.

13:43.985 --> 13:46.734
We kept it goin' and all the hidin's and,

13:46.734 --> 13:49.817
hidin's over just tiny little things.

13:52.770 --> 13:54.390
They put us there 'cause

13:54.390 --> 13:58.307
they say that my mom was
a dirty drunken woman.

14:04.037 --> 14:07.037
We're supposed to have malnutrition.

14:08.436 --> 14:11.054
My auntie, she said "your mom
was one of the cleanest women

14:11.054 --> 14:13.137
"up there in Brewarrina."

14:28.507 --> 14:30.913
- The first time I saw my father,

14:30.913 --> 14:32.830
he came up to the home.

14:32.917 --> 14:34.785
And in order to come up to the home,

14:34.785 --> 14:38.111
you had to have a letter from
the Aborigine Welfare Board,

14:38.111 --> 14:39.410
to see your kids.

14:39.410 --> 14:41.825
He never had a letter,
he just roamed in.

14:41.825 --> 14:43.846
I always remember he had this army coat.

14:43.846 --> 14:46.451
And he's holdin' out his
arms, he's callin' out,

14:46.451 --> 14:47.851
"Valerie, Valerie."

14:47.851 --> 14:49.573
And he said, "I'm your daddy."

14:49.573 --> 14:50.992
- The matron rang the police

14:50.992 --> 14:52.846
and they got him off the property

14:52.846 --> 14:55.880
because he was drunk and weren't allowed

14:55.880 --> 14:58.130
to come up there like that.

14:59.209 --> 15:02.829
When we were all taken,
he just took to drink.

15:02.829 --> 15:05.704
You know, all his kids
were gone so what the hell?

15:05.704 --> 15:07.954
He had nothing to live for?

15:09.776 --> 15:12.695
- And poor dad wrote a
letter to the welfare,

15:12.695 --> 15:15.583
"could I have my children back?"

15:15.583 --> 15:17.946
He said, "I'll get a home for 'em."

15:17.946 --> 15:20.444
He got a home for us.

15:20.444 --> 15:24.361
But they didn't, they
wouldn't give 'em to him.

15:33.264 --> 15:36.019
- You know a girl came from Cootamundra.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.545
You know she used to tell me,

15:37.545 --> 15:39.231
she said Val, I asked her, I said,

15:39.231 --> 15:40.097
"have you got a mom?"

15:40.097 --> 15:40.930
And she said, "yes."

15:40.930 --> 15:43.149
And I said, "why are you
in here if you got a mom?"

15:43.149 --> 15:46.918
I said, "I thought all the
girls didn't have mom and dad?"

15:46.918 --> 15:51.025
And she said, "Val if you go
out to the peppercorn tree,

15:51.025 --> 15:54.244
"put a cross on the
peppercorn tree every night

15:54.244 --> 15:56.327
"and your mom will come."

16:06.649 --> 16:07.899
She never came.

16:13.621 --> 16:15.589
- You know I think for many of us

16:15.589 --> 16:17.691
have often heard our elders say,

16:17.691 --> 16:21.398
they said that this protection
was kind of an ironic word

16:21.398 --> 16:23.255
just like welfare was.

16:23.255 --> 16:26.350
And that the motivations behind the policy

16:26.350 --> 16:30.517
were much more about
protecting white people

16:30.585 --> 16:32.705
from aboriginal people.

16:32.705 --> 16:35.680
And although you know, in their usual way,

16:35.680 --> 16:37.845
our eldest sort of say
that it's a kind of joke,

16:37.845 --> 16:41.762
I think that there's a
lot of pain behind that.

16:45.332 --> 16:47.866
- Tried to bring them
up as normal children

16:47.866 --> 16:51.465
and to teach them whatever we could

16:51.465 --> 16:55.632
as far as cleanliness and
that was concerned you know?"

16:55.929 --> 16:57.492
And to live as white children,

16:57.492 --> 17:00.782
that was all we were trying to do.

17:00.782 --> 17:04.449
It was the only thing
we could do with them?

17:10.422 --> 17:12.835
- I loved school, I loved
it with a dear passion.

17:12.835 --> 17:15.002
I did very well at school.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.983
We were all sitting on the outside,

17:18.983 --> 17:23.151
the officers where they had
their meals, on the steps

17:23.384 --> 17:24.705
and the matron said,

17:24.705 --> 17:27.143
"oh Adelaide's a very clever little girl."

17:27.143 --> 17:29.380
And one of the officers said,

17:29.380 --> 17:32.091
"what's the point of the her being clever?

17:32.091 --> 17:34.955
"She's only going to be a domestic."

17:34.955 --> 17:36.478
And that stuck with me

17:36.478 --> 17:39.395
and I'll never try it again, never.

17:42.143 --> 17:43.968
- Well what they trained you for

17:43.968 --> 17:48.135
was to learn to scrub and
wash and clean houses.

17:48.384 --> 17:50.967
You know, for the white people.

17:52.466 --> 17:55.049
Iron their clothes, milk a cow.

17:56.172 --> 17:57.945
You know, had to get
up early in the mornin'

17:57.945 --> 17:59.203
and milk a cow.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.901
- They teach ya to cook,
they teach ya to wash,

18:00.901 --> 18:03.318
they teach ya to iron, clean.

18:10.256 --> 18:13.173
I used to muck up, being who I was,

18:13.233 --> 18:16.092
they sort of targeted me
because I wasn't flexible

18:16.092 --> 18:17.464
like the other kids.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.799
Come and do all your duties,

18:18.799 --> 18:20.466
do that, do whatever.

18:20.466 --> 18:22.893
And I used to say, no I'm not doin' it.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.718
I would just walk away

18:24.718 --> 18:28.885
but I used to end up then
bein' locked in a store room,

18:29.217 --> 18:31.665
like a box room they called it.

18:31.665 --> 18:34.075
No lights, no nothing turned on.

18:34.075 --> 18:35.886
You'd be sittin' in this little box room

18:35.886 --> 18:37.803
for hours more or less.

18:44.721 --> 18:47.971
- They'd get ya and they'd push you in.

18:49.033 --> 18:52.700
You may try not go in,
but they push you in.

18:58.047 --> 19:01.233
You'd sleep in the box with no bed.

19:01.233 --> 19:02.233
No mattress.

19:03.111 --> 19:06.811
They don't bring in food or water for ya.

19:06.811 --> 19:10.403
And you gotta stay there
overnight, it's real dark.

19:10.403 --> 19:12.653
You know and you get scared

19:14.144 --> 19:15.884
and I thought to myself I can't cry,

19:15.884 --> 19:18.717
because you're not allowed to cry.

19:23.493 --> 19:27.263
- Across the country,
children taken into state care

19:27.263 --> 19:29.086
whether they were put in institutions

19:29.086 --> 19:31.786
or sent out into employment situations,

19:31.786 --> 19:34.563
suffered an enormous amount of abuse.

19:34.563 --> 19:38.730
Psychological, emotional,
physical and sexual abuse.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.104
- I said to this officer Hailey,

19:47.104 --> 19:49.963
she said something and
I said, "oh shut up."

19:49.963 --> 19:52.977
"That's the last time you'll
ever say that to me" she said.

19:52.977 --> 19:54.507
I'll get you.

19:54.507 --> 19:56.924
Never thought anything of it.

19:59.384 --> 20:02.801
About a week later, she was on bath duty.

20:04.804 --> 20:07.030
There's two baths and they call you in.

20:07.030 --> 20:10.420
Betty Lee was in that bath
and I was in the other bath.

20:10.420 --> 20:14.587
I was washin' myself quite
happy, very happy, singin' away

20:15.744 --> 20:17.776
and Betty yells out, "watch it Adelaide,

20:17.776 --> 20:19.859
"watch it, she's coming."

20:25.439 --> 20:28.699
I felt this burnin' right across me back.

20:32.544 --> 20:35.298
I didn't cry, I didn't cry.

20:35.298 --> 20:38.069
I didn't give her the satisfaction.

20:38.069 --> 20:40.997
But that cat o nine tails,

20:40.997 --> 20:43.355
that bloke down near the stock yards

20:43.355 --> 20:45.110
gave one to the officers.

20:45.110 --> 20:47.610
That whip, to keep us in hand.

20:49.021 --> 20:51.415
And that's what they
used to use on the cattle

20:51.415 --> 20:54.415
to get 'em into the different yards.

21:05.087 --> 21:09.254
- They used to call me a
runner, I'm always on the run.

21:12.409 --> 21:15.002
I ran away from the home

21:15.002 --> 21:17.585
and the policeman picked me up,

21:19.118 --> 21:20.701
and I was about 12.

21:22.832 --> 21:24.749
And I was put in a cell

21:25.715 --> 21:28.132
and that's where he raped me.

21:31.996 --> 21:33.829
I kept that to myself.

21:35.007 --> 21:38.534
I kept the rape to myself
'cause I always thought

21:38.534 --> 21:40.065
well you don't say those things

21:40.065 --> 21:41.801
or you get into trouble.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.551
And they won't believe ya anyway.

21:58.071 --> 22:01.821
- They were so-called
Christian missionaries.

22:03.048 --> 22:06.048
We was made to call him mom and dad.

22:08.415 --> 22:10.966
Or we used to call 'em
little names on the side.

22:13.447 --> 22:16.364
I know you should not hate anybody,

22:18.707 --> 22:22.374
but he is one man that
I really really hate.

22:26.286 --> 22:29.621
- Things he done was unbelievable

22:29.621 --> 22:32.954
and they were supposed to look after us.

22:36.305 --> 22:37.555
Used to hit us.

22:38.580 --> 22:39.913
Do other things.

22:40.851 --> 22:43.184
Things you wouldn't believe.

22:45.829 --> 22:47.246
He abused me bad.

22:48.575 --> 22:49.575
Done things,

22:51.617 --> 22:55.034
that I was too frightened to tell people.

22:58.565 --> 23:02.482
'Cause I always thought
no one would believe me

23:05.177 --> 23:08.074
and I'm still goin' in surgeries.

23:08.074 --> 23:12.241
From this day on I'm still
havin' surgery over this.

23:12.357 --> 23:13.846
That messed me, I'd go there

23:13.846 --> 23:17.214
and I'm gettin' tubes put in me.

23:17.214 --> 23:20.297
I still let it happen to me you know?

23:23.777 --> 23:25.944
Made me sit on his lap and

23:26.936 --> 23:29.971
he used to bounce up and down.

23:29.971 --> 23:31.888
It was dirty, very bad.

23:32.761 --> 23:35.511
And he calls himself a Christian.

23:56.956 --> 24:00.104
The tree was shaped like a horse,

24:00.104 --> 24:02.104
like gettin' on a horse.

24:04.685 --> 24:06.229
I jumped on it one day,

24:06.229 --> 24:09.266
I made out that I was
takin' off from Marella.

24:09.266 --> 24:12.594
Sittin' on a nose, "yahoo" and all this,

24:12.594 --> 24:14.261
thinkin' I was free.

24:16.573 --> 24:18.488
But the day had to end ya know?

24:18.488 --> 24:21.874
It was make believe days, stories.

24:24.729 --> 24:27.128
It's very very hard when you're in a home,

24:27.128 --> 24:28.787
being treated,

24:28.787 --> 24:30.286
treated like slaves.

24:30.286 --> 24:33.869
Little children, we
were kids, just slaves.

24:34.791 --> 24:37.062
To me I don't like workers sayin' dogs,

24:37.062 --> 24:38.895
but we were like dogs.

24:50.600 --> 24:53.684
In 1897,
the aboriginal protection

24:53.684 --> 24:56.422
and restriction of the sale of opium act

24:56.422 --> 24:58.505
was passed in Queensland.

24:59.845 --> 25:02.553
Under the guise of
protecting aboriginal people

25:02.553 --> 25:05.278
from physical and financial exploitation

25:05.278 --> 25:06.802
by their employers,

25:06.802 --> 25:09.699
this legislation allowed
the state government

25:09.699 --> 25:13.866
to assume complete control
over aboriginal people's lives.

25:14.373 --> 25:17.222
Including the power to control
their welfare entitlements

25:17.222 --> 25:18.055
and wages.

25:18.988 --> 25:22.155
A strategy repeated across the nation.

25:25.358 --> 25:27.130
- What happened for an aboriginal person

25:27.130 --> 25:29.897
sent out to work under
the government control

25:29.897 --> 25:32.483
was that firstly you had no idea

25:32.483 --> 25:35.313
how much the government was
selling your labour for.

25:35.313 --> 25:39.480
They didn't tell you what
wage you were supposed to get.

25:40.542 --> 25:42.778
Secondly, while you're working,

25:42.778 --> 25:44.420
up to 80% of your wage,

25:44.420 --> 25:47.394
in theory was paid as, what
they call pocket money,

25:47.394 --> 25:49.321
which was money that the employer paid you

25:49.321 --> 25:52.788
during the 12 month work period.

25:52.788 --> 25:54.297
But this pocket money quota,

25:54.297 --> 25:57.377
the government always knew
from the very very beginning

25:57.377 --> 26:00.127
was probably never properly paid.

26:01.446 --> 26:03.554
It was so easy for employers to say,

26:03.554 --> 26:05.657
yes you got a shirt worth X amount,

26:05.657 --> 26:07.966
he got food worth X amount, he got tobacco

26:07.966 --> 26:10.668
and that takes up the whole 80%,

26:10.668 --> 26:14.451
so there's only 20% of
the wage to be paid.

26:25.544 --> 26:27.927
- On many stations in to
Kimberley right through

26:27.927 --> 26:31.548
until the late 1960s, all
people were getting still

26:31.548 --> 26:35.715
was basic rations of
meat, flour, tea, sugar

26:35.921 --> 26:37.921
and a ration of tobacco.

26:39.714 --> 26:42.973
For many aboriginal workers
and their families on stations,

26:42.973 --> 26:44.380
that's all they got.

26:44.380 --> 26:48.547
Just this really meagre amount
of food and tobacco rations

26:49.143 --> 26:51.976
in exchange for working full time.

26:56.130 --> 26:59.163
- One of the ways the
government funded itself

26:59.163 --> 27:00.920
from aboriginal work was

27:00.920 --> 27:03.881
through the Aboriginal Welfare Fund.

27:03.881 --> 27:07.827
This had been set up in 1943
and was always notorious

27:07.827 --> 27:09.744
for it's mismanagement.

27:10.384 --> 27:13.849
And the fund comprised a levy on the wages

27:13.849 --> 27:16.338
of all aboriginal workers
which had been in place

27:16.338 --> 27:17.498
since 1919,

27:17.498 --> 27:19.361
and was used supposedly

27:19.361 --> 27:22.778
for the benefit of aboriginals generally.

27:25.505 --> 27:28.278
- Aboriginal workers on stations
just couldn't up and leave

27:28.278 --> 27:29.235
when they wanted to.

27:29.235 --> 27:31.045
They were bound by employment contracts

27:31.045 --> 27:32.962
and employment permits.

27:34.310 --> 27:35.405
In economic terms,

27:35.405 --> 27:37.561
they were making so much money

27:37.561 --> 27:39.012
for the pastoral station owners

27:39.012 --> 27:41.370
because they were being
paid either nothing at all

27:41.370 --> 27:44.120
or a fraction of the award wages.

27:45.945 --> 27:48.738
One of the complaints that
station owners started making

27:48.738 --> 27:52.655
in the 1940s and 1950s
when agitation for wages

27:53.594 --> 27:56.445
was coming from aboriginal
workers themselves,

27:56.445 --> 27:58.045
one of those complaints was,

27:58.045 --> 27:59.979
if we have to pay these people wages,

27:59.979 --> 28:02.556
we can't run the station.

28:02.556 --> 28:05.427
These pastoral stations
simply weren't viable economic

28:05.427 --> 28:09.228
propositions without the
huge economic contribution

28:09.228 --> 28:13.395
that aboriginal people
made to the industry.

28:13.452 --> 28:17.198
So it was really a one-way
transfer of economic resources,

28:17.198 --> 28:20.865
from the aboriginal
community to the nation.

28:22.799 --> 28:25.212
- Well generally speaking
I find them quite good.

28:25.212 --> 28:26.868
I think I prefer the native neighbour.

28:26.868 --> 28:27.701
Why?

28:27.701 --> 28:30.088
- I get along quite well with my girls.

28:30.088 --> 28:32.921
Well if I had one white housemaid,

28:33.181 --> 28:35.580
well if she resigned I'd
get left with nothing,

28:35.580 --> 28:39.747
but I've always got another
girl to take one's place.

28:42.131 --> 28:44.898
- Aboriginal girls were
taken from their families

28:44.898 --> 28:46.345
at such a rate.

28:46.345 --> 28:49.952
This was partly fueled
by the insatiable desire

28:49.952 --> 28:52.981
for cheap domestic servants.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.377
These young aboriginal workers

28:54.377 --> 28:56.077
and some of them were really little more

28:56.077 --> 28:57.418
than children themselves,

28:57.418 --> 28:59.655
they were paid so little.

28:59.655 --> 29:02.084
Like in their hand they
only got a few shillings

29:02.084 --> 29:05.991
and the rest was managed by
the aborigines department.

29:05.991 --> 29:07.480
What it meant was that,

29:07.480 --> 29:09.975
even really modest
households could expect to

29:09.975 --> 29:14.142
be able to employ an
aboriginal domestic servant.

29:15.916 --> 29:17.539
This is an area of stolen wages

29:17.539 --> 29:19.683
where I don't think you
can actually separate

29:19.683 --> 29:22.081
the stolen generation's story

29:22.081 --> 29:26.248
from the stolen wages story,
they're completely entwined.

29:35.744 --> 29:38.755
- When you reach 14 and a
half or something like that,

29:38.755 --> 29:42.005
you get your report sent up to the home

29:42.884 --> 29:45.423
and the matron sends it up to the welfare,

29:45.423 --> 29:47.489
Aborigine Welfare Board.

29:47.489 --> 29:50.160
If they think you can't go any further,

29:50.160 --> 29:52.071
they stop you from going to school

29:52.071 --> 29:55.738
and then you're put out
to domestic service.

30:00.831 --> 30:02.043
When you go on the farm,

30:02.043 --> 30:05.313
you're supposed to do the
washing, clean the house,

30:05.313 --> 30:08.396
if there's kids there,
gotta look after them.

30:08.396 --> 30:12.563
'Cause you never had a day
off, you just kept on going.

30:22.357 --> 30:23.774
- I was 16 or 15,

30:25.263 --> 30:27.846
matron put me out on a property

30:29.257 --> 30:31.098
and I didn't know how to milk a cow.

30:31.098 --> 30:32.913
I used to put water in the bucket.

30:32.913 --> 30:35.569
And I put the bucket on
top of the kitchen table

30:35.569 --> 30:37.291
and next minute I could hear this man say,

30:37.291 --> 30:39.958
"Valerie, Valerie, get in here!"

30:44.952 --> 30:46.565
I went in there and he said,

30:46.565 --> 30:48.635
"you put water in this milk."

30:48.635 --> 30:52.535
And I was shakin' like a leaf,
I didn't know what to do.

30:52.535 --> 30:55.702
So he said, "next time just watch it."

30:59.228 --> 31:03.061
And then one day I was
vacuuming in the lounge

31:04.148 --> 31:05.971
and he came back

31:05.971 --> 31:09.641
and he said, "Valerie"
he said, "get in here!"

31:09.641 --> 31:12.004
He said, "you haven't
done the kid's room."

31:12.004 --> 31:13.937
And I, I'd done the kid's room.

31:13.937 --> 31:17.400
I'd went in and vacuumed and
cleaned the kid's room up.

31:25.686 --> 31:29.686
And he just threw me on
the bed and he raped me.

31:34.613 --> 31:38.194
And that night when he came home,

31:38.194 --> 31:40.424
I had a cup and a plate in my hand

31:40.424 --> 31:42.484
and as soon as I'd seen him,

31:42.484 --> 31:45.292
I broke the cup and plate

31:45.292 --> 31:47.188
and then he gets this big fence boy

31:47.188 --> 31:50.188
and he belted me with the fence boy.

31:54.548 --> 31:55.934
And I went runnin' out

31:55.934 --> 31:59.278
and I slept in the wooden
box outside all night.

31:59.278 --> 32:00.278
It was cold.

32:03.778 --> 32:05.681
Then I woke up the next mornin'

32:05.681 --> 32:09.614
and I looked up and
seen if they were gone.

32:09.614 --> 32:11.077
And they were gone,

32:11.077 --> 32:13.632
so I went, I dunno I just
went back into the house

32:13.632 --> 32:16.009
not realizin' what he's done,

32:16.009 --> 32:17.495
I just got his shoes

32:17.495 --> 32:20.986
and I started to clean his bloomin' shoes.

32:20.986 --> 32:22.494
'Cause I was frightened
I was goin' to get myself

32:22.494 --> 32:26.577
in trouble with matron if
I didn't behave myself.

32:32.594 --> 32:36.761
Then the knock came on the
door and it was the police.

32:39.451 --> 32:41.802
And he said, "what's wrong Valerie?"

32:41.802 --> 32:43.663
And I said, "this man's been beltin' me

32:43.663 --> 32:46.609
"with this fence boy and
he's done somethin' to me."

32:46.609 --> 32:49.966
And the police said,
"you go and get your case

32:49.966 --> 32:52.685
"and pack your case, you're
goin' back to the home."

32:52.685 --> 32:56.419
When I was goin' back to the
home all matron would say,

32:56.419 --> 32:58.033
"now Valerie," she said,

32:58.033 --> 32:59.600
"don't mention or tell any of the girls

32:59.600 --> 33:00.943
"what has happened to you

33:00.943 --> 33:02.982
"and tomorrow I shall
buy you a new dress."

33:02.982 --> 33:05.016
And tomorrow came, she
bought me a new dress

33:05.016 --> 33:08.004
but I didn't know where I
was goin' in the new dress.

33:08.004 --> 33:09.506
And a week later after that,

33:09.506 --> 33:11.123
she sticks me out onto another property.

33:11.123 --> 33:15.237
I was so frightened of
the man, I ran away.

33:27.086 --> 33:29.499
Government
control over their wages

33:29.499 --> 33:31.506
effectively condemned many thousands

33:31.506 --> 33:33.219
of aboriginal girls and boys

33:33.219 --> 33:35.458
to a treadmill of abuse

33:35.458 --> 33:39.041
from which their was
little hope of escape.

33:40.541 --> 33:44.260
Internal investigations
from the early 1920s

33:44.260 --> 33:45.916
reveal aboriginal wages

33:45.916 --> 33:48.304
were misappropriated by governments

33:48.304 --> 33:50.886
to cover their own liabilities,

33:50.886 --> 33:53.056
including the cost of removing people

33:53.056 --> 33:54.603
to missions and reserves

33:54.603 --> 33:57.686
and the forcible removal of children.

33:59.216 --> 34:02.389
In essence, aboriginal
people unwittingly funded

34:02.389 --> 34:04.806
their own disenfranchisement.

34:07.794 --> 34:09.525
Even thought the racial discrimination act

34:09.525 --> 34:12.775
established a legal award wage in 1975,

34:13.681 --> 34:17.420
many aboriginal workers
continue to be underpaid

34:17.420 --> 34:21.420
and had no control over
their financial affairs.

34:24.409 --> 34:27.527
- There is almost no proper money trail

34:27.527 --> 34:29.867
of what happened to aboriginal savings,

34:29.867 --> 34:33.929
individual savings, because
people were never given

34:33.929 --> 34:36.101
any record of what was
being done to their money

34:36.101 --> 34:39.036
until 1968 when they were given bank books

34:39.036 --> 34:41.069
which showed just the amounts

34:41.069 --> 34:42.837
still sitting in their account,

34:42.837 --> 34:45.376
and for many people that was a tiny amount

34:45.376 --> 34:48.376
after perhaps three decades of work.

34:50.713 --> 34:54.071
So the profitability of the state,

34:54.071 --> 34:57.458
it was built on the backs of black workers

34:57.458 --> 34:59.762
and it was built to a large extent

34:59.762 --> 35:02.587
with the money, which
black workers earned,

35:02.587 --> 35:04.337
but governments took.

35:28.547 --> 35:30.393
- Stroke of luck came.

35:30.393 --> 35:32.753
I was sent to Sydney.

35:32.753 --> 35:34.253
I was goin' on 16.

35:42.740 --> 35:45.501
I went to work for this
beautiful woman at Double Bay,

35:45.501 --> 35:47.327
her and her mother.

35:47.327 --> 35:49.898
She was paralysed from the waist down.

35:49.898 --> 35:52.378
She gave me all the respect I needed

35:52.378 --> 35:54.815
and she was the only one that did.

35:54.815 --> 35:56.667
She always made sure if I was upset,

35:56.667 --> 35:59.220
she'd say to me, "what's
your problem Adelaide?"

35:59.220 --> 36:01.233
And sometimes I couldn't tell her

36:01.233 --> 36:03.663
and then other times I could tell her.

36:03.663 --> 36:07.163
And she said, "oh we'll get through this."

36:17.078 --> 36:19.411
- I'd run away from Marella.

36:20.600 --> 36:24.767
I went in a red fern and lived
in there for three months,

36:25.489 --> 36:27.250
on the streets.

36:27.250 --> 36:29.965
Stealin' milk and snow
drop and takin' clothes

36:29.965 --> 36:32.573
off the lines and puttin'
my clothes back on the line

36:32.573 --> 36:33.490
to survive.

36:35.743 --> 36:37.976
I seen these group of aboriginal people

36:37.976 --> 36:39.620
come towards me.

36:39.620 --> 36:42.808
I crossed the road, I was frightened.

36:42.808 --> 36:46.975
'Cause you know, you grew
up with the kids in the home

36:47.441 --> 36:49.691
but seein' the free people,

36:50.678 --> 36:52.837
you know people that was free?

36:52.837 --> 36:55.670
Havin' them do what they wanna do.

37:04.192 --> 37:08.359
- I used the bloody men,
they used me and I used them.

37:09.788 --> 37:11.868
It wasn't for love.

37:11.868 --> 37:14.774
They might've loved me,
but I never loved them.

37:14.774 --> 37:17.629
What the hell's love gotta do with it?

37:17.629 --> 37:20.528
I had to go with these white fellas,

37:20.528 --> 37:22.053
'cause I believed that white fellas

37:22.053 --> 37:25.102
are a better race that me own people.

37:25.102 --> 37:27.185
I learnt different later, ha!

37:27.185 --> 37:29.602
I used these white fellas up.

37:30.547 --> 37:31.625
Reason why I used to go in the pub

37:31.625 --> 37:33.825
to meet me own people, I'm
trying to find who I belong to,

37:33.825 --> 37:36.825
where I come from, things like that.

37:38.832 --> 37:41.315
- It's taken a long time for me to realise

37:41.315 --> 37:43.565
that I wasn't really white.

37:44.538 --> 37:48.538
That's how good they are,
it's like a brainwash.

37:50.039 --> 37:51.911
You know, when I seen a dark person

37:51.911 --> 37:53.567
I used to cross the road,

37:53.567 --> 37:56.716
'cause I didn't wanna associate.

37:56.716 --> 37:58.826
You're brought up that way.

37:58.826 --> 38:01.159
You accept things, you know?

38:03.083 --> 38:05.866
- They said not to marry
an aborigine person,

38:05.866 --> 38:08.783
because they were dirty and the white race

38:08.783 --> 38:11.700
was better than the aborigine race.

38:15.641 --> 38:17.400
- I'm sure it gives people some comfort

38:17.400 --> 38:18.658
to think that these were things

38:18.658 --> 38:20.749
that all happened in the past.

38:20.749 --> 38:23.533
But the fact of the matter
is that it's just not true.

38:23.533 --> 38:25.097
You've first of all got people

38:25.097 --> 38:28.202
who live in our community who lived this.

38:28.202 --> 38:30.284
To them it wasn't just yesterday,

38:30.284 --> 38:32.599
they live with this every day.

38:38.645 --> 38:41.462
The sorts of traumas that
they've suffered as children.

38:41.462 --> 38:45.013
The impact of separation
from their families.

38:45.013 --> 38:48.438
These traumas do get handed down.

38:48.438 --> 38:51.699
Their removal as children made
it very difficult for them

38:51.699 --> 38:53.199
to be in a family.

39:07.955 --> 39:09.535
When I got married,

39:09.535 --> 39:13.702
I was lookin' for somebody to
look after me for a change.

39:16.618 --> 39:18.951
It didn't work out that way.

39:22.228 --> 39:25.061
Used to come home drunk, you know?

39:27.399 --> 39:30.399
And all he wanted was you know what.

39:31.505 --> 39:32.818
And I thought to myself,

39:32.818 --> 39:35.519
I suppose it was meant to happen again.

39:35.519 --> 39:38.179
I got so used to bein' abused

39:38.179 --> 39:40.429
and I didn't trust anybody.

39:41.539 --> 39:44.372
I think that trust is a big thing.

39:45.332 --> 39:48.701
People say you've gotta move forward.

39:48.701 --> 39:50.538
How does one move forward

39:50.538 --> 39:52.672
when you still go that in your mind,

39:52.672 --> 39:55.339
what happened to you as a child?

40:08.464 --> 40:10.020
- As much as I love my husband,

40:10.020 --> 40:12.005
I did still have no trust in him you know?

40:12.005 --> 40:13.422
It was very hard.

40:16.096 --> 40:19.576
My husband never smoked, he never drunk

40:19.576 --> 40:21.613
and he never got into me.

40:21.613 --> 40:23.696
He taught me how to cook,

40:24.914 --> 40:28.331
but then he had to die from the dialysis.

40:29.852 --> 40:32.465
From this day on I still
haven't got a boyfriend

40:32.465 --> 40:35.000
'cause I'm too frightened,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
for what I went through.

40:58.158 --> 41:00.329
- When I did go out
and have my own family,

41:00.329 --> 41:03.961
I used to check the kids every night.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.406
I put my hand on their chest

41:05.406 --> 41:06.584
to see if they were still breathin'

41:06.584 --> 41:07.717
or see if they were still in their bed

41:07.717 --> 41:09.881
because they had no idea,

41:09.881 --> 41:12.796
they're not takin' my kids.

41:12.796 --> 41:15.133
And in the end of it, I just
reared my kids on my own,

41:15.133 --> 41:18.050
I worked and reared my kids myself.

41:30.766 --> 41:33.930
- I don't think I was
meant to be a mother.

41:33.930 --> 41:36.742
I just haven't had it in me.

41:36.742 --> 41:37.575
I tried.

41:40.375 --> 41:42.341
We weren't brought up with a mother,

41:42.341 --> 41:45.275
so how do you expect to be
a mother to your children

41:45.275 --> 41:47.327
when you don't even know
how to be a mother to them

41:47.327 --> 41:51.494
when you've never had one,
to help ya, to guide you.

41:55.551 --> 41:57.155
- I used to say to the kids,

41:57.155 --> 41:58.994
if you have a girlfriend or a boyfriend,

41:58.994 --> 42:01.732
I wanna know who they are

42:01.732 --> 42:04.773
and I wanna know who their parents are,

42:04.773 --> 42:07.385
because they could have
been related, you know?

42:07.385 --> 42:10.670
You get around the same
area where you come from,

42:10.670 --> 42:13.590
everybody's more or less
related to this one or that one

42:13.590 --> 42:15.270
and I'm thinkin' well no,

42:15.270 --> 42:17.502
I wanna know who they are
and who their parents are

42:17.502 --> 42:19.585
and where they come from.

42:23.354 --> 42:27.140
- I was just goin' on 26 when
I found out I was pregnant.

42:27.140 --> 42:29.835
And I was cranky, cranky as hell.

42:29.835 --> 42:32.385
So I went to see an abortionist,

42:32.385 --> 42:34.474
I didn't want a kid, never wanted a kid,

42:34.474 --> 42:36.219
never wished to have any kids.

42:36.219 --> 42:38.447
If this is the way they
treat aborigine kids,

42:38.447 --> 42:40.600
never will I bring a child into this world

42:40.600 --> 42:44.350
to be abused like this,
that's how I thought.

42:46.697 --> 42:48.197
Well I had Robert,

42:51.334 --> 42:53.258
and I said to the lady,
I'll leave if you like

42:53.258 --> 42:56.904
and she said, "no you're not,
we'll bring him up together."

42:56.904 --> 42:58.691
And she brought him up.

42:58.691 --> 42:59.941
He wasn't mine.

43:01.431 --> 43:03.329
She took control of him.

43:03.329 --> 43:06.496
I was just the one who gave the birth.

43:09.237 --> 43:12.568
And I've never said to
him I love you, never.

43:12.568 --> 43:13.818
'Cause I can't.

43:15.228 --> 43:19.193
Because of what happened up at that home.

43:19.193 --> 43:21.769
Taught me not to trust
people, not to love anyone,

43:21.769 --> 43:24.269
not even to love me own child.

43:40.300 --> 43:43.967
- I was goin' through
depression pretty bad.

43:45.764 --> 43:47.761
I was havin' flashbacks

43:47.761 --> 43:50.928
so I had to go and see a psychiatrist.

43:53.028 --> 43:54.924
I told him what happened

43:54.924 --> 43:56.783
and he said, "why don't you sketch

43:56.783 --> 43:59.515
"what happened to you as a child?"

43:59.515 --> 44:02.515
And I've been doin' that ever since.

44:03.540 --> 44:06.651
When you're paintin' you're
in a world of your own.

44:06.651 --> 44:10.604
Your mind's occupied by
the paint your doin'.

44:10.604 --> 44:14.771
'Cause if I don't paint, I
start to have the flashbacks.

44:15.446 --> 44:17.863
I start to get panic attacks.

44:32.471 --> 44:34.087
- I do what they taught me to do.

44:34.087 --> 44:37.004
I just clean and look after myself.

44:37.471 --> 44:39.721
Play tennis and play bowls.

44:40.851 --> 44:44.074
Very sporty, I get out
and play a lot of sports.

44:44.074 --> 44:47.407
I used to always play sports, years ago.

44:50.190 --> 44:52.991
Even had a go at football.

44:58.895 --> 45:01.693
- And when I went to Sydney,

45:01.693 --> 45:05.860
I couldn't understand why I
was gettin' pains all the time.

45:07.731 --> 45:10.720
I was playin' tennis and I
used to double up with pains.

45:10.720 --> 45:14.887
I used to play with these
white people out at Rose Bay.

45:15.672 --> 45:17.095
Went home to the lady I worked for,

45:17.095 --> 45:19.631
I said, "I dunno I've got
these two pains under here."

45:19.631 --> 45:23.660
She said, "we'll send you to the doctor."

45:23.660 --> 45:24.921
Now I went into hospital,

45:24.921 --> 45:26.643
not knowing what was going to happen.

45:26.643 --> 45:27.953
Not knowing.

45:27.953 --> 45:30.232
Doctor came around, looked at my chart,

45:30.232 --> 45:33.558
he said, "look girly I'm gonna
ask you one simply question

45:33.558 --> 45:35.368
"and one simple question only.

45:35.368 --> 45:38.716
"You can give me that answer or not?

45:38.716 --> 45:42.275
"That kidney was caused through trauma.

45:42.275 --> 45:43.929
"Did you fall?

45:43.929 --> 45:47.678
"Or fall off a horse,
fall down out of a tree?"

45:47.678 --> 45:51.241
That's what that bloody
thing did, that whip.

45:51.241 --> 45:52.613
I didn't say nothin'.

45:52.613 --> 45:55.946
I said, nah I don't wanna talk about it.

46:02.085 --> 46:05.507
- Now it's gone, why'd
he put me through that?

46:05.507 --> 46:09.121
I get angry and I swear, to myself.

46:09.121 --> 46:12.416
'Cause you gotta get
everything out you know?

46:12.416 --> 46:14.650
When you got that anger, you do anything.

46:14.650 --> 46:18.299
I threw plates, I wanted to
jump on the railway tracks

46:18.299 --> 46:19.632
down Rooty Hill.

46:21.234 --> 46:23.117
And even when my husband died I said Doug

46:23.117 --> 46:27.284
what've you left me for 'cause
I need ya but where are you?

46:34.913 --> 46:37.879
So I went back just to sit there.

46:37.879 --> 46:41.046
To see a little creek runnin' through.

46:47.636 --> 46:51.053
Now it's a recreation centre built there.

46:52.538 --> 46:54.544
And I wanna try and get a plaque put up

46:54.544 --> 46:57.877
for the Marella children that was there.

47:08.816 --> 47:11.071
In 2006, a senate legal

47:11.071 --> 47:13.259
and constitutional affairs committee

47:13.259 --> 47:17.016
established an inquiry into
stolen wages nationally.

47:17.016 --> 47:20.626
Almost 170 years after a British committee

47:20.626 --> 47:24.256
first recommended that
protectors of aborigines

47:24.256 --> 47:26.423
be appointed in Australia.

47:28.914 --> 47:31.541
The senate committee
found extensive evidence

47:31.541 --> 47:35.067
of misappropriated trust
funds, welfare entitlements

47:35.067 --> 47:37.069
and stolen wages.

47:37.069 --> 47:39.995
Estimated to be at least
500 million dollars

47:39.995 --> 47:42.476
in Queensland alone.

47:42.476 --> 47:45.573
It recommended that
indigenous people be supported

47:45.573 --> 47:47.406
to tell their stories.

47:48.024 --> 47:50.955
Given unhindered access
to government archives

47:50.955 --> 47:53.765
and that a national scheme be established

47:53.765 --> 47:56.329
to undertake preliminary legal research

47:56.329 --> 47:57.829
into stolen wages.

48:01.238 --> 48:05.405
Almost 10 years later,
claimants are still waiting.

48:07.923 --> 48:12.081
- Reparations have been a
really tricky legal issue.

48:12.081 --> 48:15.224
For an average person
who hears what happens,

48:15.224 --> 48:17.492
to many of the people who were taken

48:17.492 --> 48:20.857
and then suffered horrendous abuse,

48:20.857 --> 48:24.235
have long psychological damage,

48:24.235 --> 48:27.630
it becomes a real question as to why

48:27.630 --> 48:30.630
there isn't a legal remedy for that?

48:36.582 --> 48:40.406
- In May 2002, Queensland
Labour Premier Peter Beattie

48:40.406 --> 48:43.999
made an offer of
reparations in parliament.

48:43.999 --> 48:47.024
He said, "we have no idea how
much money has gone missing

48:47.024 --> 48:49.620
"from people's accounts over the decades."

48:49.620 --> 48:52.128
He quoted it was a least
half a billion dollars

48:52.128 --> 48:54.163
over an 80 year period.

48:54.163 --> 48:57.726
From all of the whole range
of funds that went missing

48:57.726 --> 49:01.893
and so he offered 55.6
million dollars was his offer.

49:03.113 --> 49:06.465
What it worked out to was $2000 per person

49:06.465 --> 49:09.577
for a younger claimant
and $4000 per person

49:09.577 --> 49:12.391
for somebody 55 years and older.

49:12.391 --> 49:16.558
To get that money, you had to
sign away your legal rights.

49:16.622 --> 49:18.681
There was such a poor
take up of the offer,

49:18.681 --> 49:20.339
people were so disgusted

49:20.339 --> 49:22.892
that the subsequent labour government

49:22.892 --> 49:25.516
increased the amount to $7000 which again

49:25.516 --> 49:28.317
is still an absolute pittance.

49:28.317 --> 49:32.484
Certainly the Queensland
government, in it's conditions

49:32.810 --> 49:36.304
said that only people who
were alive on the date

49:36.304 --> 49:38.614
in May 2002 when they made the offer,

49:38.614 --> 49:41.202
only they could apply for the money,

49:41.202 --> 49:43.705
so anybody who's parents, grandparents,

49:43.705 --> 49:46.640
great grandparents had lost
money under the system,

49:46.640 --> 49:48.473
they were out of luck.

49:51.663 --> 49:55.288
- I think it's important
that what they do do

49:55.288 --> 49:58.823
is recognise that there
was a structural harm

49:58.823 --> 50:02.990
that was being committed
against a broad group of people.

50:08.886 --> 50:12.219
Their experience was continually denied.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.839
There's something very important about

50:15.839 --> 50:17.872
a formal structure that says,

50:17.872 --> 50:19.974
well yes it did take place

50:19.974 --> 50:24.141
and yes there were people who
worked in these circumstances

50:24.549 --> 50:27.105
and were effectively
treated as slave labour

50:27.105 --> 50:30.188
and we need to do something about it.

50:31.803 --> 50:35.259
When you look at the poverty
within indigenous communities,

50:35.259 --> 50:36.919
the fact that there's so little

50:36.919 --> 50:40.073
that people had to hand
down, in a material sense,

50:40.073 --> 50:42.221
it is a way in which people

50:42.221 --> 50:44.643
who have been exploited for their labour

50:44.643 --> 50:48.810
are unable to even bequeath
that to their children

50:49.571 --> 50:51.571
and their grandchildren.

50:56.913 --> 51:00.158
- There really needs
to be a political will

51:00.158 --> 51:03.972
at both the federal level and
the state and territory level

51:03.972 --> 51:05.687
to drive this issue,

51:05.687 --> 51:09.645
until aboriginal workers
and their families

51:09.645 --> 51:12.812
receive the justice that they deserve.

51:14.722 --> 51:17.743
- The money that should've
gone to aboriginal workers

51:17.743 --> 51:21.347
was used to continue to remove children.

51:21.347 --> 51:22.845
And when you think that this was a policy

51:22.845 --> 51:25.369
that went form the 1880s informally,

51:25.369 --> 51:28.031
through to a very strong state structure

51:28.031 --> 51:31.635
by the early 1900s, right into the 1960s,

51:31.635 --> 51:34.385
you're talking about generations.

51:35.743 --> 51:37.512
You can even conceive where people

51:37.512 --> 51:40.564
would've been funding these
bodies that would then

51:40.564 --> 51:43.688
come and take their own children.

51:48.712 --> 51:51.843
- An awful lot of the
despair on the communities,

51:51.843 --> 51:55.918
is rooted in the
institutionalised dis-empowerment

51:55.918 --> 51:57.335
over generations.

51:58.260 --> 52:00.925
And I believe that the
government is responsible

52:00.925 --> 52:03.291
for the conditions today.

52:03.291 --> 52:04.949
Legally responsible.

52:04.949 --> 52:06.279
I think they had a duty of care.

52:06.279 --> 52:08.504
They gave themselves that duty of care

52:08.504 --> 52:11.004
in their laws and regulations.

52:12.595 --> 52:14.133
- There is probably a short answer

52:14.133 --> 52:16.888
to what you call someone
who is in that circumstance,

52:16.888 --> 52:20.244
especially a child who is getting no wages

52:20.244 --> 52:22.327
or is severely underpaid.

52:23.245 --> 52:26.432
The United Nations human rights standards

52:26.432 --> 52:28.599
would say that is slavery.

52:31.667 --> 52:33.730
People will say, "well you
know that's what happened

52:33.730 --> 52:35.747
"in the southern states of America

52:35.747 --> 52:37.595
"and we didn't have that here."

52:37.595 --> 52:39.871
But for the child who
was working for nothing

52:39.871 --> 52:43.394
in someone else's kitchen
with no other choice,

52:43.394 --> 52:45.067
cannot escape,

52:45.067 --> 52:48.663
is beaten when they don't do their work,

52:48.663 --> 52:51.830
is abused in other ways, it's slavery.

53:05.517 --> 53:07.017
It hurts,

53:07.046 --> 53:09.218
to think what the welfare done to them

53:09.218 --> 53:11.301
and what they done to us.

53:13.402 --> 53:15.902
The pain that we went through.

53:18.110 --> 53:22.277
To look back on
my life, it wasn't a life.

53:24.755 --> 53:26.588
It just wasn't a life.

53:35.490 --> 53:38.046
I got my freedom.

53:38.046 --> 53:39.559
I got a lot of love

53:39.559 --> 53:42.892
and I got my children, my grandchildren.

53:44.602 --> 53:46.776
And now they give me support.

53:46.776 --> 53:47.609
They give me the strength,

53:47.609 --> 53:49.293
'cause I can stand up and talk to them,

53:49.293 --> 53:53.405
tell them what's right
from wrong you know?

54:04.358 --> 54:05.386
- I will never forgive them

54:05.386 --> 54:08.199
for what they done to me you know?

54:08.199 --> 54:11.423
I mean I wasn't the only one
who got raped and abused.

54:11.423 --> 54:14.546
There was thousands of
aborigine kids, boys too,

54:14.546 --> 54:17.713
they got raped, I wasn't the only one.

54:23.179 --> 54:24.777
- I was determined not to be broke,

54:24.777 --> 54:27.429
they wasn't gonna break me,

54:27.429 --> 54:29.679
I wanted to be me own self.

54:30.615 --> 54:32.241
I was seein' what happened with other kids

54:32.241 --> 54:34.339
and the way it affected them.

54:34.339 --> 54:36.468
A lot of them come out
and all they wanted to do

54:36.468 --> 54:37.705
was they get on the drugs

54:37.705 --> 54:39.010
and they get on the alcohol

54:39.010 --> 54:41.187
and all this sorta thing.

54:41.187 --> 54:45.166
I never went that way,
I was determined not to.

54:45.166 --> 54:48.575
I was gonna make somethin' of myself.

54:48.575 --> 54:51.143
But I ended up married with a mob of kids.

54:52.921 --> 54:54.338
Lovin' it though.

54:56.906 --> 54:58.565
- Why do you think a
lot of these young boys

54:58.565 --> 55:02.732
and the men and the fathers
went to drink and died?

55:02.848 --> 55:06.266
Because they lost their
kids like my father.

55:06.266 --> 55:08.590
He had nothing to live for, nothing.

55:08.590 --> 55:10.142
So he just threw in the towel,

55:10.142 --> 55:11.884
they weren't going to give his kids back,

55:11.884 --> 55:14.631
he asked for them back, so what?

55:14.631 --> 55:15.631
That was it.

55:16.975 --> 55:20.892
- I had to go to TAFE to
learn about my people.

55:21.666 --> 55:23.405
I was very proud you know?

55:23.405 --> 55:26.519
I was hurt to learn about them, very hurt,

55:26.519 --> 55:27.664
'cause I was sayin' to myself,

55:27.664 --> 55:31.831
why didn't I learn these
things while I was at school?

55:32.315 --> 55:35.692
And I'm proud to be an aborigine.

55:35.692 --> 55:37.753
And I always will be.

55:37.753 --> 55:41.358
I'm proud to be a proud black woman.

55:41.358 --> 55:42.691
Proud to be one.

55:43.641 --> 55:44.474
Okay?

56:06.472 --> 56:10.601
♫ As I went down to the river to pray
