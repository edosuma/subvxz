01:44.330 --> 01:46.059

01:52.580 --> 01:54.730

I KNOW MOM COULDN'T BEAR IT
IF SOMEBODY RECOGNIZED ME.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.438
SHE DOESN'T CARE
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.185
(scoffs lightly)
YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:38.220 --> 02:40.188
SHE ONLY CARES ABOUT ME
AND WHETHER OR NOT

02:40.220 --> 02:42.256
I'M MAKING HER LOOK BAD.

02:42.290 --> 02:44.679
YOUR MOM'S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

02:44.730 --> 02:46.618
NOTHING COULD MAKE HER
LOOK BAD.

02:46.660 --> 02:48.196
OHH, THAT'S A GOOD SPIN.

02:48.230 --> 02:50.164
NO WONDER YOU'RE INSPECTOR.

02:51.670 --> 02:54.559
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
TAKING ANY TIME OFF?

02:55.700 --> 02:57.236
YOU'VE HAD A HARD YEAR.

02:57.270 --> 02:58.828
YOUR MOM COULD
GET YOU SOMETHING

02:58.870 --> 03:00.872
NICE AND QUIET
AT HEADQUARTERS.

03:00.910 --> 03:02.548

03:02.580 --> 03:04.138

NO.

03:05.610 --> 03:07.475
I'D RATHER BE ABDUCTED AGAIN.

03:08.720 --> 03:12.212

03:17.690 --> 03:20.625

03:34.880 --> 03:36.131

DOESN'T WANT ME ON IT.

03:37.580 --> 03:38.649
WHY NOT?

03:38.680 --> 03:41.012
HE DOESN'T THINK I CAN
CUT IT ON THE STREET.

03:41.050 --> 03:43.018
BUT HE TOLD ME NOT TO WORRY
BECAUSE I'M A PECK

03:43.050 --> 03:44.312

I HAVE TO PROVE THAT I'M NOT
SOME TRAGIC LITI'LE GIRL

04:12.010 --> 04:14.547

05:00.300 --> 05:02.495
DEFINE "UNUSUAL."

05:02.530 --> 05:05.328
I THINK YOU KNOW

05:05.370 --> 05:07.861
NO, EVERYTHING--

09:20.290 --> 09:21.655
I'M MAKING MUFFINS.

09:21.690 --> 09:23.351
(mouth full) YOU ACTUALLY
MIGHT BE ON TO SOMETHING.

09:23.390 --> 09:24.459
IT'S GOOD.

09:24.490 --> 09:26.629
(chuckles) YEAH.

09:26.660 --> 09:27.922
(fingernail tapping)

09:27.960 --> 09:31.168
OFFICER EPSTEIN, YOU RECENTLY
TOOK SOME TIME OFF.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.395
I-I-I HURT MYSELF
PLAYING BASKETBALL.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.567
I DIDN'T WANT TO COME BACK
TILL I WAS A HUNDRED PERCENT.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.603
(chuckles softly) AND ARE YOU
A HUNDRED PERCENT?

09:38.640 --> 09:40.437
YES, MA'AM.
(door buzzes)

09:40.480 --> 09:42.300
YOU FIND OUT ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT TASK FORCE

09:42.340 --> 09:43.602
CALLAGHAN'S
PU'I'I'ING TOGETHER?

09:43.650 --> 09:45.242
NO, ONLY THAT MY FATHER
DOESN'T WANT ME ON IT.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.406
WHY NOT?

09:46.450 --> 09:48.270
HE DOESN'T THINK I CAN
CUT IT ON THE STREET.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.242
BUT HE TOLD ME NOT TO WORRY
BECAUSE I'M A PECK

09:50.290 --> 09:51.814
AND I'LL GET PROMOTED
ANYWAY.

09:51.850 --> 09:53.454
HEY.
I WISH I WAS A PECK.

09:53.490 --> 09:55.708
HEY.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.625
LOOK. MY FRIENDS ARE HERE.

09:57.660 --> 09:59.321

09:59.360 --> 10:01.794

(Chris) UH, YOU WANT
A MUFFIN?

10:01.830 --> 10:03.024
(Andy) PERFECT.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.664
WHAT'S GOING ON?
BIG INTERVIEW?

10:05.700 --> 10:08.897
YES. YEAH, VERY BIG INTERVIEW.
SENSITIVE, TOO.

10:08.940 --> 10:10.862
SO...
MM--

10:10.910 --> 10:12.434
DO NOT DISTURB.

10:12.470 --> 10:14.176
(radio chatter)

10:14.210 --> 10:15.905
(chuckles)
OKAY, THE POINT IS,
WHATEVER THIS TASK FORCE

10:15.940 --> 10:17.271
THEY'RE PUTTING TOGETHER,
I WANT TO BE ON IT.

10:17.310 --> 10:19.369
I HAVE TO PROVE THAT I'M NOT
SOME TRAGIC LITI'LE GIRL

10:19.410 --> 10:21.412
WHO CAN'T HANDLE HERSELF.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE?

10:21.450 --> 10:23.418
ANYTHING? THE WEATHER,
THE BIEBS?

10:23.450 --> 10:25.748
ALL RIGHT.
I'M JUST GONNA SAY...

10:25.790 --> 10:28.088
HATE HIS NEW HAIR.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.680
(door closes)
HEY, LIKE I SAID--
DO NOT DISTURB.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.290
DIAZ, SOMEONE'S ASKING
FOR YOU AT RECEPTION.

10:33.330 --> 10:34.957
EPSTEIN, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.026
HEY. HAVE YOU
SEEN NICK?
WHO?

10:38.070 --> 10:39.935
(Gail) PRETTY BOY,
AFGHANISTAN.

10:39.970 --> 10:41.528
RINGING ANY BELLS?
SOMETHING WRONG, SIR?

10:41.570 --> 10:44.801
PEOPLE TALK.
E.R. NURSES TALK.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.728
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

10:46.780 --> 10:49.999
AND DON'T TELL ME YOU GOT HURT
PLAYING BASKETBALL.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.245
THEN YOU WANT TO TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND?

10:52.280 --> 10:54.419
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE--
CRYSTAL MARKES!

10:56.150 --> 10:57.981
WHO YOU SLEEP WITH
IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

10:58.020 --> 10:59.908
BUT, DOV, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

10:59.960 --> 11:03.020
DATING THE GIRL WHO--
WHOSE BROTHER YOU SHOT?

11:03.060 --> 11:05.551
GETTING YOUR ASS KICKED
BECAUSE OF IT?

11:05.590 --> 11:09.094
IS THIS YOUR TWISTED WAY
OF DEALING WITH WHAT HAPPENED?

11:09.130 --> 11:10.427
YOU'RE RIGHT, SIR.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.530
MY PERSONAL LIFE IS
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

11:13.570 --> 11:15.060
DON'T BE LATE FOR PARADE.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.504
(Sarah) YOU'VE BEEN OFF ACTIVE
DUTY QUITE A LOT THIS YEAR--

11:19.540 --> 11:24.978
ALMOST A MONTH AND A HALF AFTER
THE TYLER MARKES SHOOTING.

11:25.010 --> 11:26.102
THAT LEAVE WAS MANDATED.

11:26.150 --> 11:28.869
I KNOW SOMETIMES IT TAKES
A GOOD DEAL OF TIME

11:28.920 --> 11:31.343
TO FULLY RECOVER
FROM AN INCIDENT LIKE THAT.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.551
I THINK YOU'LL FIND,
CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

11:33.590 --> 11:35.057
I DID THE BEST I COULD TODAY.

11:35.090 --> 11:39.481
THE BEST YOU COULD...
CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

11:39.530 --> 11:40.792
OKAY.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.923
(crowd cheering)
(air horns blowing)

11:42.970 --> 11:45.564
(indistinct conversations)
(man) GUYS, YOU LOOK SO GOOD.
YOU LOOK GOOD.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.931
ARE YOU GUYS RAIDERS FANS?

11:46.970 --> 11:49.530
(man speaking indistinctly)

11:49.570 --> 11:51.435
(man) GOOD GAME, MAN.
(Andy) KNOCK IT OFF!

11:51.470 --> 11:53.609

HEY, DOV!

11:55.480 --> 11:56.902
(man) HEY, YOU WANNA GO
FOR A BEER OR SOMETHING?

11:56.950 --> 11:58.247
OKAY, YOU GOT THREE SECONDS

11:58.280 --> 11:59.838
TO SHUT YOUR MOUTH BEFORE
I KNOCK YOUR TEETH OUT.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.279
ALL RIGHT, GAME'S OVER.
LET'S GO.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.083
OFFICER, I DON'T WANT
ANY TROUBLE.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.917
I'M JUST TRYING TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME, BUT THIS GUY--
GOOD, THEN GO HOME.

12:04.950 --> 12:06.588
COME ON, I'M JUST TRYING
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME, TOO--

12:06.620 --> 12:07.780
WITH YOUR MOM.
OH, YEAH, YOU'RE HILARIOUS!

12:07.820 --> 12:09.617
HEY!
HEY, HEY, HEY!

12:09.660 --> 12:12.185
WHOA! BACK OFF!
EVERYBODY GET BACK!

12:12.230 --> 12:15.290
I SAID GET ON YOUR STOMACH!
HANDS ON THE GROUND!
HEY! GET OFF!

12:15.330 --> 12:19.118
PUT YOUR HANDOSVS'N THE GROUND!
(grunting)

12:21.400 --> 12:23.265
GAIL! HELP!

12:23.310 --> 12:24.902
OHH!

12:24.940 --> 12:26.635
(spray his '
s
AAH! ing)

12:26.670 --> 12:29.138
(crowd shouting)
AAH!

12:29.180 --> 12:31.068
THAT'S IT! (grunting)

12:31.110 --> 12:33.510
(groaning)

12:33.550 --> 12:35.415
I USED REASONABLE FORCE
TO SUBDUE MY SUSPECT,

12:35.450 --> 12:37.088
CUFFED HIM,
PUT HIM IN MY SQUAD.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.610
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
PEPPER-SPRAYED?

12:38.650 --> 12:40.151
YES, MAN, I HAVE.

12:40.190 --> 12:42.215
IT'S A STANDARD EXERCISE
AT THE POLICE COLLEGE.

12:42.260 --> 12:45.787
THEY SPRAY US. WE HAVE TO
CONTROL AND CUFF A SUSPECT.

12:45.830 --> 12:47.957
WHY DO THEY MAKE YOU DO
THIS EXERCISE?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.888
UH, IT'S A TEST TO MAKE SURE

12:49.930 --> 12:52.319
WE CAN DO OUR JOB PROPERLY
IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES.

12:52.370 --> 12:55.362
WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU
DID YOUR JOB PROPERLY TODAY?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.129
YES, I WOULD.

12:57.170 --> 12:59.502
I DEFUSED THE SITUATION,
I MADE THE NECESSARY ARRESTS,

12:59.540 --> 13:00.768
AND NO ONE GOT HURT.

13:00.810 --> 13:03.370
OFFICER EPSTEIN, WHEN YOU
WERE PEPPER-SPRAYED,

13:03.410 --> 13:05.139
DID IT HURT?

13:05.180 --> 13:07.171
Y-YES, IT DID.

13:08.180 --> 13:10.182
JUST MAKING SURE YOU GIVE
AN ACCURATE ACCOUNT

13:10.220 --> 13:13.155
OF TODAY'S EVENTS,
YOU UNDERSTAND.

13:13.190 --> 13:15.249
SO WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU BROUGHT

13:15.290 --> 13:17.087
THE SUSPECT BACK
TO THE STATION?

13:17.130 --> 13:20.452
(radio chatter and static)

13:22.800 --> 13:24.495
(dispatcher) ...does not
want contact.

13:24.530 --> 13:26.293
You just want to do
an area check.

13:26.330 --> 13:27.729
(sets gearshift
and turns off engine)

13:29.940 --> 13:32.261
I NEED TO WASH MY FACE.
YOU ALREADY WASHED
YOUR FACE.

13:32.310 --> 13:33.902
OH, YEAH?
WELL, IT'S STILL BURNING.

13:33.940 --> 13:35.669
WELL, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

13:35.710 --> 13:36.972
(kicks seat)

13:37.010 --> 13:38.568
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
OUT OF HERE?

13:38.610 --> 13:40.714
SOON AS THE OFFICER IN FRONT
OF US HAS CLEARED THE AREA.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.911
(spits)

13:42.950 --> 13:46.044
(Gail) OUT OF THE CAR.

13:46.090 --> 13:48.115
OUT! GET OUT!

13:48.160 --> 13:50.754
(grunting)

13:50.790 --> 13:52.087
HEY!

13:52.130 --> 13:54.018

13:55.430 --> 13:57.227

13:57.270 --> 14:00.398
WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM?
HUH? HE OKAY?

14:00.440 --> 14:03.034
HE'S FINE.
(grunting)

14:05.270 --> 14:07.431
UM, OFFICER,
YOU'RE BLEEDING.

14:09.580 --> 14:11.707
(groans) JUST--

14:12.950 --> 14:15.248
(muffled) GET IN THE CAR.

14:15.280 --> 14:18.181

(panﬁng)

14:19.050 --> 14:21.814
(panﬁng)

14:21.860 --> 14:23.088
(slaps railing)

14:23.130 --> 14:25.382
(exhales)

14:25.430 --> 14:28.456
WHEN YOU TOOK CUSTODY OF
THE SUSPECT, DID YOU SEARCH HIM?

14:28.500 --> 14:30.388
I WAS COVERED IN O.C. SPRAY.

14:30.430 --> 14:31.966
MY NOSE WAS BLEEDING.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.536
I COULD NOT HAVE SEARCHED
THE GUY

14:33.570 --> 14:36.266
WITHOUT CONTAMINATING HIM.

14:36.300 --> 14:38.302
BESIDES, HE WAS COMPLIANT.
HE WAS COOPERATIVE.

14:38.340 --> 14:40.570
COMPLIANT? REALLY?

14:40.610 --> 14:42.407
COOPERATIVE?

14:42.440 --> 14:44.908
HE SEEMED COMPLIANT.
HE SEEMED COOPERATIVE.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.406
THANK YOU. THAT'S BETTER.

14:48.350 --> 14:49.908
HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY SUSPECT?

14:49.950 --> 14:51.815
(radio static and chatter)

14:51.850 --> 14:53.659
HOW'D_HE GET IN THERE?
(Gail) WELL, FRANK
BROUGHT HIM IN.

14:53.690 --> 14:55.385
THAT'S THE GUY THAT ASSAULTED
ME. I WANT TO PRESS CHARGES.

14:55.420 --> 14:57.251
YEAH, AFTER YOU TOOK
A SWING AT ME.

14:57.290 --> 14:58.757
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU CALM DOWN,
PAL? YOU ALMOST BLINDED ME.
STOP IT, PLEASE.

14:58.790 --> 15:00.451
DOV. DOV. I GOT A LINEUP, OKAY?
(indistinct shouting)

15:00.500 --> 15:01.751
AND I GOTTA GET THIS
DONE QUICKLY,

15:01.800 --> 15:03.620
SO JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE--
LET ME OUT!

15:03.670 --> 15:05.991
HEY!
LET ME OUT OF HERE
RIGHT NOW, OR I'LL HURT HIM!

15:06.030 --> 15:07.133
I'M NOT KIDDING AROUND!
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

15:07.170 --> 15:08.068
THIS IS PECK. WE'VE GOT
A HOSTAGE SITUATION

15:08.100 --> 15:09.192
IN BOOKING--BARRICADED
GUNMAN HOLDING ONE.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.309
NO, DO NOT POINT THAT AT HIM,
DO NOT POINT THAT AT US!

15:10.340 --> 15:11.500
PUT IT DOWN!
GET BACK!

15:11.540 --> 15:13.576
PUT YOUR WEAPON DOWN!

15:15.140 --> 15:16.949
(siren wailing)

15:16.980 --> 15:18.948
ONE MINUTE THE SUSPECT
APPEARED NONTHREATENING,

15:18.980 --> 15:21.073
THE NEXT... HE HAD A GUN.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.839
OKAY, LET ME GET THIS
STRAIGHT.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.188
YOU LOST CONTROL
OF YOUR FIRST PRISONER

15:26.220 --> 15:28.017
AND PEPPER-SPRAYED HIM.
I NEVER HAD CONTROL OF--

15:28.060 --> 15:30.779
THEN, WHEN YOU SWITCHED
PRISONERS WITH OFFICER PECK,

15:30.830 --> 15:33.492
YOU THREW YOUR NEW PRISONER
INTO THE BACK OF A SQUAD CAR

15:33.530 --> 15:35.191
AND LEFT HIM THERE
UNSUPERVISED?

15:35.230 --> 15:37.869
EVERYTHING HAPPENED VERY FAST.
I HAD TO MAKE A JUDGMENT CALL.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.390
THE SAME WAY YOU MADE
A JUDGMENT CALL

15:39.430 --> 15:41.466
IN THE TYLER MARKES CASE?

15:41.500 --> 15:43.229
I WAS CLEARED
IN THAT SHOOTING.

15:43.270 --> 15:45.534
OH, I'M AWARE OF THAT.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.629
THAT'S ALL FOR NOW,
OFFICER EPSTEIN.

15:51.380 --> 15:54.042
(radio chatter)

15:55.650 --> 15:57.311
DOV--

16:00.820 --> 16:03.459

16:32.720 --> 16:34.187

MY HEAD.

16:34.220 --> 16:37.451
YOU FEEL THE NEED
TO CLEAR YOUR HEAD?

16:37.490 --> 16:38.787
NO.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.492
(gate whirring)

19:42.080 --> 19:43.445

22:07.590 --> 22:09.012

23:09.980 --> 23:12.915
YOU'RE GONNA NEED

23:12.950 --> 23:14.918
I MEAN, EVER SINCE I GOT TO 15,
EVERYONE'S PEGGED ME

23:14.960 --> 23:16.882
AS A SMALL-TOWN KID
WITH MORE MUSCLES THAN BRAINS.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.558
I GOTTA PROVE
THAT'S NOT WHO I AM.

23:18.590 --> 23:20.126
IF YOU WERE THAT GUY,

YOU WERE THE "FACE OF 15"
FOR THAT, UH, OUTREACH CAMPAIGN,

23:38.680 --> 23:43.481
BUT I DON'T REALLY SEE ANYTHING

23:43.520 --> 23:45.078
REMARKABLE HOW?

23:45.120 --> 23:46.587
NO, NO, THERE'S NO JUDGMENT

26:04.590 --> 26:05.955
(sighs)

26:10.900 --> 26:12.663
(people speaking indistinctly
in distance)

26:12.700 --> 26:15.066
(Frank) BIG FOOTBALL GAME
THIS AFTERNOON.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.466
GET OUT THERE AND MAKE SURE
NO ONE GETS HURT,

26:17.500 --> 26:18.467
NOTHING GETS DAMAGED.

26:18.510 --> 26:20.159
(Gail)
WHERE'S OFFICER COLLINS?

26:20.210 --> 26:21.871
(door closes)
CALLED IN SICK.

26:21.910 --> 26:23.002
YOU'RE LATE.

26:23.040 --> 26:26.749
SORRY, SIR. I JUST...
I HAD TO... SORRY.

26:26.780 --> 26:29.874
THANKS. YOU JUST VOLUNTEERED
TO WORK IN BOOKING.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.013
EVERYONE ELSE, DISMISSED.

26:32.050 --> 26:33.654
(indistinct conversations)

26:33.690 --> 26:36.318
HEY. YOU OKAY?
I MEAN, 20 MINUTES AGO,

26:36.360 --> 26:38.851
YOU WERE THE MUFFIN MAN,
AND NOW YOU LOOK ILL.

26:38.890 --> 26:41.996
I'M--I'M FINE. I-I JUST...

26:43.930 --> 26:45.466
I JUST WANT TO GET TO WORK.

26:47.800 --> 26:51.167
I UNDERSTAND THAT BOOKING CAN BE
A STRESSFUL ASSIGNMENT.

26:51.210 --> 26:54.077
IT TAKES A LOT OF ATTENTION
AND FOCUS.

26:54.110 --> 26:55.407
IT DOES.

26:55.440 --> 26:58.876
ANY REASON WHY YOUR FOCUS MAY
HAVE BEEN IMPAIRED TODAY?

26:58.910 --> 27:01.674
CIRCUMSTANCES WE SHOULD TAKE
INTO CONSIDERATION?

27:01.720 --> 27:04.883
NO. I HAD IT ALL
UNDER CONTROL.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.148
NO. NO, I CAN'T LEAVE YET.

27:06.190 --> 27:08.010
LOOK, DENISE, WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

27:08.060 --> 27:10.415
I'M JUST SAYING,
IF HE'S MINE, IT--

27:10.460 --> 27:11.859
YES, OF COURSE
I'M SAYING "IF."

27:11.890 --> 27:14.097
LOOK, YOU DROP THIS BOMB ON ME
AFTER THREE YEARS.

27:14.130 --> 27:15.927
OF COURSE I'M GONNA WONDER--

27:15.960 --> 27:17.518
DENISE?
(buzzer sounds)

27:17.560 --> 27:19.266
HEY.

27:19.300 --> 27:20.619
JUST--JUST. ..

27:20.670 --> 27:23.264
(radio chatter, beeps)

27:23.300 --> 27:26.098
LOOK, DENISE, THERE'S A KEY
ON TOP OF THE WATER METER

27:26.140 --> 27:27.459
OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR.

27:27.510 --> 27:29.239
JUST LET YOURSELF IN.
I'LL GET THERE AS SOON AS I CAN.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.599
JUST...

27:31.610 --> 27:32.577
SORRY.

27:32.610 --> 27:34.919
UH, ROBERT SLOAN. NO PRIORS.

27:34.950 --> 27:37.248
(buzzer sounds, beep)
OKAY, I'LL JUST BOOK HIM NOW.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.349
HEY, YOU GOTTA SPEED
THIS UP.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.982
I GOT DOV BEHIND ME
WITH ANOTHER BODY.

27:40.020 --> 27:40.987
ALL RIGHT. JUST CUFF HIM
TO THE BENCH.

27:41.020 --> 27:42.453
HEY THERE, BUDDY.

27:42.490 --> 27:44.720
WHAT'S THE MATTER? YA--YA CATCH
A LITTLE COLD OUT THERE?

27:44.760 --> 27:46.489
WHY DON'T YOU BITE ME?
NO BITING.

27:46.530 --> 27:48.054
HEY, LISTEN, WE NEED TO GET
THIS DONE QUICKLY, OKAY?

27:48.100 --> 27:49.590
(handcuffs clicking)
I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE
AS SOON AS I CAN.

27:49.630 --> 27:50.654
OKAY, WELL, THEN WHY DON'T
WE GET TRACI TO PRINT 'EM?

27:50.700 --> 27:51.724
SHE'S THE FASTEST.

27:51.770 --> 27:52.725
OH, UH, SHE CAN'T.

27:52.770 --> 27:53.964
SHE'S WITH LUKE RIGHT NOW.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.262
THEY'RE BRINGING IN A VICTIM
FOR QUESTIONING.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.165
UH, DO YOU KNOW WHICH ROOM
THEY'RE USING?

27:57.200 --> 27:58.508
NO.

27:59.310 --> 28:01.403
CHRIS, CAN YOU PROCESS
MY GUY?

28:01.440 --> 28:03.237
I'M SORRY. I REALLY HAVE TO DEAL
WITH SOMETHING.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.407
(radio chatter)

28:07.010 --> 28:08.671
(clipboard clatters)
SHE LIKES ME.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.449
YEAH, SHE LIKES EVERYBODY.
(keys jangle)

28:10.480 --> 28:12.345
OKAY, MR. SLOAN...
(handcuffs click)

28:12.390 --> 28:14.312
OHH.
I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO EMPTY
YOUR POCKETS, OKAY?

28:14.360 --> 28:15.679
YEAH.
(buzzer sounds)

28:15.720 --> 28:17.187
(handcuffs clatter)

28:17.220 --> 28:18.551
WHY IS THIS PRISONER
SITTING ALONE

28:18.590 --> 28:21.058
IN A SQUAD CAR
IN THE SALLY PORT?

28:21.100 --> 28:22.453
WHOSE PRISONER IS HE?

28:22.500 --> 28:25.094
WELL, I-I BROUGHT HIM IN,
BUT I HAD TO SWITCH WITH DOV.

28:25.130 --> 28:26.825
SO WHERE'S EPSTEIN?!
I-I DON'T KNOW.

28:26.870 --> 28:27.962
WHERE'S MCNALLY?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.467
SHE WENT TO GO TAKE CARE
OF SOMETHING. UH...

28:29.500 --> 28:33.106
DIAZ, I GAVE YOU THIS DETAIL,
WHICH MEANS ALL OF THIS--

28:33.140 --> 28:35.176
OFFICERS DUMPING THEIR PRISONERS
AND DISAPPEARING,

28:35.210 --> 28:36.734
BODIES LEFT ALONE
IN SQUAD CARS--

28:36.780 --> 28:39.408
IT MAKES ME LOOK BAD.
FIX IT.

28:39.450 --> 28:40.576
YES, SIR. YES.

28:40.610 --> 28:42.714
(keys jangle)

28:42.750 --> 28:44.809
STAFF SERGEANT BEST TOOK
CUSTODY OF THE SUSPECT

28:44.850 --> 28:46.249
IN THE SALLY PORT,
THEN HANDED HIM OFF TO YOU.

28:46.290 --> 28:47.245
IS THAT RIGHT?

28:47.290 --> 28:49.485
THAT'S RIGHT.
SO AT THIS POINT,

28:49.520 --> 28:51.829
THE SUSPECT WAS
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY?

28:51.860 --> 28:53.179
HE WAS.

28:53.230 --> 28:55.289
OFFICER PECK, CAN YOU PLEASE PUT
MR. SLOAN IN THE BULL PEN?

28:55.330 --> 28:57.867
(keys jangle, handcuffs click)
MR. SLOAN.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.197
(Robert) FUTURE MRS. SLOAN?

28:59.230 --> 29:00.868
(Gail) I'M A LESBIAN.
OHH.

29:00.900 --> 29:02.197
I GET THAT A LOT.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.401
(buzzer sounds)

29:04.440 --> 29:07.136
OKAY. WE'RE GONNA START
OVER, ALL RIGHT?

29:07.170 --> 29:09.775
TAKE THAT GUY.
(lock clicks)

29:09.810 --> 29:11.300
I'M GONNA UNHOOK YOU NOW.
ARE YOU GONNA BEHAVE?

29:11.350 --> 29:12.305
(exhales deeply)

29:12.350 --> 29:14.944
HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY SUSPECT?

29:14.980 --> 29:16.675
HOW'D HE GET IN THERE?

29:16.720 --> 29:19.439
WELL, FRANK BROUGHT HIM IN.
THAT'S THE GUY THAT ASSAULTED
ME. I WANNA PRESS CHARGES.

29:19.490 --> 29:21.253
(Chris) HEY, CALM DOWN.
YEAH, AFTER YOU TOOK
A SWING AT ME.

29:21.290 --> 29:22.780
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU CALM DOWN,
PAL? YOU ALMOST BLINDED ME.
STOP, PLEASE.

29:22.820 --> 29:23.889
HEY. HEY, LOOK, LOOK, DOV.
DOV, I GOT A LINEUP, OKAY?

29:23.930 --> 29:24.954
I'LL HAVE YOUR BADGE.

29:24.990 --> 29:26.059
AND I GOTTA GET THIS
DONE QUICKLY.
AAH.

29:26.090 --> 29:27.580
SO JUST LEAVE HIM ALONE--
LET ME OUT!

29:27.630 --> 29:29.996
HEY!
LET ME OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW,
OR I'LL HURT HIM!

29:30.030 --> 29:31.065
THIS IS PECK. WE HAVE
A HOSTAGE SITUATION IN BOOKING.

29:31.100 --> 29:32.260
I'M NOT KIDDING AROUND!
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?!

29:32.300 --> 29:33.892
PUT--DO NOT POINT THAT AT HIM,
AND DO NOT POINT THAT AT US!

29:33.940 --> 29:35.339
BARRICADED GUNMAN HOLDING ONE.
PUT IT DOWN!

29:35.370 --> 29:37.292
GET BACK!
PUT YOUR WEAPON DOWN!

29:37.340 --> 29:39.433
WHY DIDN'T YOU PUT THE PRISONERS
IN SEPARATE CELLS?

29:39.470 --> 29:40.562
IT WAS ONLY GONNA BE
FOR A SECOND,

29:40.610 --> 29:42.009
UNTIL I GOT
EVERYTHING SORTED.

29:42.040 --> 29:45.100
DO YOU ONLY FOLLOW PROTOCOL
WHEN IT'S A SLOW DAY?

29:45.150 --> 29:46.777
BECAUSE I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU,
OFFICER DIAZ.

29:46.810 --> 29:49.313
A DAY LIKE TODAY--THIS IS
PRECISELY WHY PROTOCOL EXISTS.

29:49.350 --> 29:50.669
YES, MA'AM. I W--

29:50.720 --> 29:52.813
DID YOU SEARCH THE SUSPECT
BEFORE YOU PUT HIM IN THE CELL?

29:52.850 --> 29:54.078
I THOUGHT THEY HAD ALREADY
SEARCHED HIM.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.213
AND THEN YOU INSTRUCTED
OFFICER PECK TO PUT HER PRISONER

29:56.260 --> 29:58.649
IN THE SAME CELL AS THE SUSPECT
YOU DIDN'T SEARCH.

29:58.690 --> 30:00.385
THEY SHOULD'VE SEARCHED HIM.
BUT THEY DIDN'T,

30:00.430 --> 30:03.126
AND NEITHER DID YOU,
AND YOU WERE IN OVER YOUR HEAD.

30:03.160 --> 30:06.596
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
PEOPLE DIDN'T DO THEIR JOBS.

30:06.630 --> 30:09.098
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
PEOPLE WERE SO WRAPPED UP

30:09.140 --> 30:11.461
IN THEIR OWN CRAP
THAT THEY DIDN'T BACK ME UP.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.637
OFFICER DIAZ, ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOUR FELLOW OFFICERS

30:13.670 --> 30:15.171
ARE TO BLAME
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

30:15.210 --> 30:16.871
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

30:16.910 --> 30:18.775
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

30:20.780 --> 30:22.247
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.089
(alarm sounding)
(man) LET ME OUT!

30:24.120 --> 30:25.815
(Dov) PUT THE GUN DOWN.
LET ME OUT OF HERE,
OR I'LL HURT HIM!

30:25.850 --> 30:27.613
WE CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU'VE GOTTA PUT THE GUN DOWN.

30:27.650 --> 30:29.550
DO NOT POINT THAT GUN AT US!
GET BACK! GET BACK!

30:29.590 --> 30:30.852
JUST RELAX, MAN.
PUT THE GUN DOWN!

30:30.890 --> 30:31.720

30:31.760 --> 30:32.784
ANYONE ELSE COMES
IN THIS ROOM,

30:32.830 --> 30:34.559
I'LL PUT A BULLET IN THIS GUY.
ROB. MY NAME'S ROB.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.555
SHUT UP!
PLEASE DON'T SHOOT ME!

30:35.600 --> 30:36.897
(clicks)
PLEASE DON'T SHOOT ME!

30:36.930 --> 30:38.397
PUT THE GUN DOWN NOW.
NO ONE NEEDS TO GET HURT.

30:38.430 --> 30:41.092
STOP TALKING TO ME!

30:41.140 --> 30:43.734
I'M ONLY TALKING TO HIM.

30:43.770 --> 30:45.909
I'M ONLY TALKING TO DIAZ.

30:47.510 --> 30:49.205
(radio chatter)

30:49.240 --> 30:51.640
OKAY. OKAY. YOU WANNA TALK?

30:52.510 --> 30:55.547
WE'LL TALK.
JUST YOU AND ME.

30:59.050 --> 31:01.109
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT. YOU WANNA TALK?

31:01.160 --> 31:02.650
LET'S TALK, OKAY?
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

31:02.690 --> 31:04.624
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU START
BY OPENING THE DOOR?

31:04.660 --> 31:06.287
FIRST YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME, OKAY?

31:06.330 --> 31:07.649
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
THIS WILL WORK.

31:07.690 --> 31:08.896
WHAT DO I GOTTA DO?

31:08.930 --> 31:10.124
ALL RIGHT. WELL, THERE'S
INNOCENT PEOPLE IN HERE.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.424
WE DON'T WANT THEM
TO GET HURT, OKAY,

31:12.470 --> 31:14.529
SO WHAT I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO DO FIRST IS

31:14.570 --> 31:15.537
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LET
ROB GO.

31:15.570 --> 31:16.889
NO! NO!

31:16.940 --> 31:18.601
OKAY, WAIT. OKAY.
WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY HERE?

31:18.640 --> 31:20.665
HE'S CUFFED TO THE BENCH.
CAN WE LET HIM GO?

31:20.710 --> 31:22.075
YEAH.

31:22.110 --> 31:23.805
OKAY. OFFICER PECK, GET HIM
OUT OF HERE.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.569
(radio chatter, keys jangle)

31:25.610 --> 31:27.749
(handcuffs clicking)
HEY, NO.
DON'T LOOK AT THEM, MAN.

31:27.780 --> 31:29.577
KEEP YOUR EYES ON ME, OKAY?
RIGHT HERE. RIGHT HERE.

31:29.620 --> 31:31.281

31:31.320 --> 31:32.309

31:32.350 --> 31:34.409
TELL HIM TO MOVE BACK!
I CAN'T DO THAT.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.018
AAH!

31:36.060 --> 31:37.311
AAH!

31:37.360 --> 31:38.850
OFFICER EPSTEIN,

ELLIOTT, MY NAME'S CHRIS.
LOOK, I GOTTA TELL YOU,

31:45.670 --> 31:47.297
THAT WASN'T THE BEST WAY
TO START OFF, OKAY,

31:47.330 --> 31:48.638
BUT WHAT I NEED YOU
TO DO NOW IS

31:48.670 --> 31:49.932
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO LET ROB GO.

31:49.970 --> 31:51.301
NO! NO, NO. I CAN'T!

31:51.340 --> 31:52.466
(inhales deeply)
HE'S MY ONLY WAY
OUT OF HERE.

31:52.510 --> 31:53.863
NO, HE'S NOT.

32:02.850 --> 32:03.839
GO BACK? WHAT DO YOU--

32:03.880 --> 32:07.145
PRISON! I WAS IN THERE
FOR FIVE YEARS,

32:07.190 --> 32:09.579
GOT OUT ON THREE

32:09.620 --> 32:10.917
AND NOW I GOT A KID
ON THE WAY.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.222
NEW LIFE, NEW LEASE.

32:12.260 --> 32:13.659
YOU'RE GONNA BE A DAD.

32:13.690 --> 32:15.726
LOOK, LOOK, WELL, DO--D-DO YOU

32:15.760 --> 32:18.194

WHY? YOU GOT KIDS?

32:19.300 --> 32:22.235
NO. I JUST--
I ALWAYS WANTED 'EM.

32:22.270 --> 32:24.500
JUST THOUGHT I'D BE
A GOOD DAD.
ME, TOO.

32:25.540 --> 32:26.962
MY GIRLS ARE WAITING FOR ME.

32:27.010 --> 32:28.329
WHAT'S GOING ON

IT'S YOUR FAULT.

32:41.720 --> 32:44.257
NOBODY'S GONNA DIE, OKAY,

32:44.290 --> 32:46.485

32:49.700 --> 32:51.725
LOOK, I'M TRYING TO KEEP
YOU ALIVE HERE.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.169

I'LL DIAL.
NO, NO. OKAY, FINE.

32:58.970 --> 33:00.801
YOU CAN DIAL.

33:00.840 --> 33:02.899
(gunshot)

33:02.940 --> 33:05.738
(shards clatter)

33:28.700 --> 33:31.669
(radio chatter)

33:31.710 --> 33:33.507
(clanks)

33:39.310 --> 33:41.972
(men speak indistinctly)

33:42.020 --> 33:43.419
(man) SEND E.M.S.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.951
CHRIS?

33:56.100 --> 34:00.059
OFFICER DIAZ, THERE'S...
(sighs) NO QUESTION

34:00.100 --> 34:03.433
YOU ACTED BRAVELY AND PUT
YOUR OWN SAFETY AT RISK

34:03.470 --> 34:04.903
TO SAVE THE LIVES
OF OTHERS.

34:04.940 --> 34:07.204
THAT IN ITSELF
IS COMMENDABLE,

34:07.240 --> 34:10.277
BUT HOW YOU GOT TO THAT POINT
IS THE GREATER ISSUE.

34:11.950 --> 34:13.906
TODAY...

34:13.950 --> 34:16.976
WOULD YOU SAY THAT
YOU WERE...

34:17.020 --> 34:18.817
DISTRACT ED?

34:19.920 --> 34:21.717
(sighs)

34:23.420 --> 34:24.956
I DON'T KNOW.

34:24.990 --> 34:27.481
WOULD YOU ADMIT THAT YOU...

34:27.530 --> 34:29.521
LOST CONTROL
OF THE SITUATION?

34:34.700 --> 34:37.737
(paper rustles)

34:37.770 --> 34:39.135
(sighs)

34:39.170 --> 34:41.934
(dials cell phone)

34:44.610 --> 34:46.407
FRANK, COME ON UP.

34:46.450 --> 34:47.906
WE'RE DONE.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.508
(beep)

35:03.200 --> 35:04.167
(door opens)

35:04.200 --> 35:06.293
(sighs)

35:06.330 --> 35:08.935
(indistinct conversations,
telephones ringing in distance)

35:08.970 --> 35:12.007
WELL, THAT'S IT. (sighs)
I'M GONNA LOSE MY BADGE.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.507
SHE MADE IT SEEM LIKE
IT WAS MY FAULT.

35:13.540 --> 35:15.235
SHE MADE US ALL FEEL
LIKE THAT.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.907
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT WON'T BE
SO BAD.

35:16.940 --> 35:19.943
SHE TOLD ME ONE OF US IS
PROBABLY GONNA LOSE OUR JOBS.

35:19.980 --> 35:21.311
SHE ACTUALLY TOLD YOU THAT?

35:21.350 --> 35:25.184
YEAH. I THINK SHE WAS WARNING ME
AS A FAVOR TO MY PARENTS.

35:25.220 --> 35:28.348
SO THAT LEAVES THREE OF US
ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.

35:28.390 --> 35:31.484
(chuckles) LIKE I SAID,
I WISH I WAS A PECK.

35:34.430 --> 35:36.227
MS. MILLS, YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND,

35:36.260 --> 35:38.990
WE'RE STILL DEALING
WITH THE RECENT PASSING

35:39.030 --> 35:40.327
OF ONE OF OUR OFFICERS.

35:40.370 --> 35:43.237
OKAY, BUT NOW WE'VE GOT
ANOTHER DEATH TO DEAL WITH,

35:43.270 --> 35:45.864
A MAN WHO WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF THIS DIVISION.

35:45.910 --> 35:47.434
THAT PRISONER BROUGHT A GUN
INTO MY HOUSE.

35:47.470 --> 35:49.529
BECAUSE YOUR OFFICERS DIDN'T
FOLLOW PROTOCOL.

35:49.580 --> 35:50.933
MY OFFICERS ARE ONLY HUMAN.

35:50.980 --> 35:55.178
YES, AND I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE
A NEW BABY AT HOME.

35:55.220 --> 35:57.939
MAYBE YOUR OFFICERS AREN'T
THE ONLY ONES...

35:57.980 --> 35:59.538
DISTRACT ED RIGHT NOW.

36:00.590 --> 36:02.979
(lowered voice)
MY PERSONAL LIFE HAS NOTHING

36:03.020 --> 36:04.328
TO DO
WITH WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

36:04.360 --> 36:06.180
TWO MEN WERE SHOT.
ONE OF THEM DIED--

36:06.230 --> 36:08.084
IN YOUR CELLS,
ON YOUR WATCH.

36:08.130 --> 36:09.256
NO MATTER HOW
I LOOK AT THIS,

36:09.300 --> 36:11.097
FRANK, IT...
(knocks on door)

36:12.700 --> 36:14.793
PECK, NOT NOW.

36:14.840 --> 36:15.966
I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.332
OFFICER PECK, I HAVE
EVERYTHING I NEED. THANK YOU.

36:18.370 --> 36:19.564
WELL, I NEED TO REVISE
MY STATEMENT,

36:19.610 --> 36:21.475
BECAUSE I WAS WRONG.

36:21.510 --> 36:23.068
(whispers) PECK, LEAVE IT.

36:23.110 --> 36:25.101
I PUT THE SUSPECT
IN MY SQUAD CAR

36:25.150 --> 36:26.879
WITHOUT PATTING HIM DOWN.

36:26.910 --> 36:28.719
I REMEMBER NOW.
I-I DIDN'T SEARCH HIM,

36:28.750 --> 36:31.287
AND I DIDN'T COMMUNICATE
THAT FACT TO MY FELLOW OFFICERS.

36:31.320 --> 36:34.778
OFFICER PECK, DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT YOU ARE SAYING?

36:34.820 --> 36:37.152
YES, I DO.

36:37.190 --> 36:39.181
THE FIRST OFFICER
WHO TAKES CUSTODY OF A PRISONER

36:39.230 --> 36:41.357
IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE PRIMARY SEARCH

36:41.400 --> 36:43.891
OF THAT PRISONER,
AND I FAILED MY DUTY.

36:48.870 --> 36:51.088
(indistinct conversations)

36:51.140 --> 36:53.734
ALL RIGHT. YOU GUYS GO HOME.

36:53.770 --> 36:54.907
KEEP YOUR PHONES ON YOU.

36:54.940 --> 36:56.737
SHE'LL MAKE
A RECOMMENDATION SHORTLY.

36:56.780 --> 36:58.179
WELL, WHAT ABOUT GAIL?

36:58.210 --> 37:00.678
DON'T WORRY ABOUT PECK.
WORRY ABOUT YOURSELVES.

37:00.710 --> 37:03.178
SIR, IS SOMEONE GONNA LOSE
THEIR BADGE?

37:03.220 --> 37:06.519
I DON'T KNOW.
KEEP YOUR PHONES ON.

37:06.550 --> 37:13.524
***

37:18.500 --> 37:19.626
HEY.

37:19.670 --> 37:21.968
ANY WORD?
NOT YET. HOW'S IT GOING?

37:22.000 --> 37:23.399
VICTIM'S NAME WAS
ELLIOTT BENSON.

37:23.440 --> 37:25.305
DID THREE OF FIVE
FOR AGGRAVATED ASSAULT.

37:25.340 --> 37:26.568
BEEN ON PAROLE ABOUT A YEAR.

37:26.610 --> 37:27.963
I DON'T GET IT. (sighs)

37:28.010 --> 37:29.705
I MEAN, HE'S GOT A BABY
ON THE WAY. HE'S ON PAROLE.

37:29.740 --> 37:30.934
WHY IS HE CARRYING
A GUN AROUND?

37:30.980 --> 37:33.778
SOME PEOPLE CAN'T SHAKE
A BAD HABIT.

37:33.810 --> 37:35.141
UH, YOU WANT ME TO WAIT
FOR YOU?

37:35.180 --> 37:36.340
NO, GO AHEAD.
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

37:36.380 --> 37:37.847
ALL RIGHT.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.609
(telephone rings in distance)

37:39.650 --> 37:41.515
(indistinct conversations)

37:41.560 --> 37:42.515
HEY.

37:42.560 --> 37:45.723
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOING HERE?

37:47.160 --> 37:50.197
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU WERE OKAY.

37:50.230 --> 37:52.118
WELL, THAT'S NOT YOUR JOB
ANYMORE.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.504
(siren wails)

37:59.540 --> 38:02.077
CHRIS! WAIT UP.

38:02.110 --> 38:03.509
OH, I CAN'T GO
TO THE PENNY TONIGHT, MAN.

38:03.540 --> 38:04.609
I GOTTA GET HOME.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.072
DENISE IS THERE.
SHE'S WAITING FOR ME.

38:06.110 --> 38:07.771
DENISE IS AT THE APARTMENT?
DID YOU GUYS GET BACK TOGETHER?

38:07.810 --> 38:10.176
'CAUSE I TOTALLY
MISSED THAT.

38:10.220 --> 38:12.245
SHE SHOWED UP AT THE STATION
TODAY OUT OF NOWHERE.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.245
AND?

38:13.290 --> 38:14.985
AND...

38:15.020 --> 38:17.159
SHE... HAD A LITTLE BOY
WITH HER.

38:17.190 --> 38:18.418
YOU'RE KIDDING.

38:19.390 --> 38:21.278
I DID THE MATH.
HE'S THE RIGHT AGE.

38:21.330 --> 38:23.628
HE EVEN KINDA LOOKS
LIKE ME.

38:24.730 --> 38:26.527
YOU GOTTA GET
A PATERNITY TEST.

38:26.570 --> 38:30.734
LOOK,
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TODAY,

38:30.770 --> 38:33.830
I DON'T THINK I REALLY CARE
WHETHER HE'S MINE OR NOT.

38:33.870 --> 38:36.236
MAYBE I JUST WANT A CHANCE
TO BE A GOOD DAD.

38:36.280 --> 38:38.032
(Jon Bryant's "Evening Sun"
Playing)

38:38.080 --> 38:39.945
(sighs)

38:39.980 --> 38:44.019
HIS NAME'S CHRISTIAN.
CAN YOU TAKE A CAB?

38:44.050 --> 38:45.711
YEAH, SURE.

38:47.820 --> 38:48.855
GOOD LUCK.

38:51.860 --> 38:53.350
WHAT IF S.I.U. CALLS
AND WE'RE HAVING SO MUCH FUN,

38:53.390 --> 38:55.028
WE MISS IT?

38:55.060 --> 38:58.359
UH... I THINK WE'RE
PROBABLY SAFE.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.698
* ...THE HAND OF FAITHFULNESS *

39:00.730 --> 39:03.836
* I CAN'T LET UP *

39:03.870 --> 39:06.407
WOW. HAIR OF THE DOG?

39:06.440 --> 39:07.407
HERE YOU GO.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.408
HAIR OF THE GINGER ALE.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.237
(indistinct conversations)

39:11.280 --> 39:13.976
(sighs) WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:14.010 --> 39:17.377
I MEAN, SUPER ROOKIE COMES
TO WORK TODAY DRUNK?

39:17.420 --> 39:18.580
NEXT YEAR I'LL BOOK IT OFF,

39:18.620 --> 39:21.555
TAKE A PERSONAL DAY
OR SOMETHING.

39:24.630 --> 39:27.588
* TAKE HER TO THE WATERS *

39:27.630 --> 39:29.291
WHO WAS IT?

39:29.330 --> 39:30.922
* ...LEAVE HER OUT TO DRY *

39:30.960 --> 39:33.121
SHANE BUTLER.

39:35.370 --> 39:37.429
HE WAS A PLATOON BUDDY.

39:37.470 --> 39:39.438
HE TOOK MY PATROL,
TOOK MY PLACE

39:39.470 --> 39:43.236
AND... DROVE OVER AN I.E.D.

39:43.280 --> 39:47.546
* SET YOUR EYES UPON THE LORD *

39:47.580 --> 39:49.969
I DON'T WANT TO CARRY THAT
AROUND WITH ME,

39:51.220 --> 39:53.245
SO ONCE A YEAR,

39:53.290 --> 39:55.588
IF I DO THIS,
I CAN FORGIVE MYSELF

39:55.620 --> 39:56.848
WITHOUT FORGETTING.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.587
* OH, THE FEELING... *

39:59.630 --> 40:02.121
HELL OF A DAY TO GET
THE FLU, PAL.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.696
COME ON.

40:03.730 --> 40:06.494

40:36.130 --> 40:37.654
I'M SORRY.

40:38.630 --> 40:40.029
IT'S OKAY.

40:40.070 --> 40:43.039
(speaks indistinctly)

40:43.070 --> 40:44.958
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD
YOU SOONER.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.001

40:55.950 --> 40:59.283

41:11.800 --> 41:14.997
UH, RIGHT NOW
I'D JUST LIKE TO...

41:16.140 --> 41:17.767
DO THIS.

41:18.970 --> 41:20.767
(whispering) OKAY.

41:22.110 --> 41:23.737
OKAY.

41:23.780 --> 41:25.441
(beeping continues)

(laughs)

41:27.110 --> 41:28.441
(chuckles)

41:29.520 --> 41:31.511
JUST CALL ALREADY.

41:31.550 --> 41:33.415

SO MY FATHER IS INSPECTOR,
AND MY MOTHER IS SUPERINTENDENT,

41:39.890 --> 41:41.027
AND I AM A PECK.

41:41.060 --> 41:43.324
GAIL, WHAT'S WRONG?
I WAS TALKING TO MY DAD,

41:43.360 --> 41:45.089
AND I WAS PRACTICALLY
KINDA, LIKE, BRAGGING TO HIM

41:45.130 --> 41:47.166
HOW I HANDLED MYSELF TODAY,
AND... (chuckles)

41:47.200 --> 41:48.565
'CAUSE I GUESS
THAT I THOUGHT THAT...

41:48.600 --> 41:51.706
(chuckles) MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD. I AM AN IDIOT!

41:51.740 --> 41:53.605
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

41:53.640 --> 41:58.668
WELL, UM, S.I.U. CALLED,
AND THEY ARE SUSPENDING ME,

41:58.710 --> 42:01.076

AFTER MY BADGE, SO...
