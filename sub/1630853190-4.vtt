WEBVTT

00:03.037 --> 00:06.274
Good morning, Mr. Mint.

00:06.374 --> 00:09.943
Here's your breakfast,
Radical Rosemary.

00:10.044 --> 00:13.214
Rise and shine, Jim.

00:13.314 --> 00:16.917
You're giving off very strong
lonely widow vibes.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.821
I'm watering my plants
for my new iCarly PlantCam.

00:20.921 --> 00:23.657
It's a livestream so viewers
can pop in at any time

00:23.757 --> 00:24.925
and check on their progress.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.628
It's become something
of a soap opera.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.597
Yeah, I can tell by looking
at his leaves,

00:29.697 --> 00:31.832
Jim is the evil twin.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.868
Why are you dressed
like the Grim Reaper

00:34.968 --> 00:36.003
on casual Friday?

00:36.104 --> 00:37.771
I am trying on my new outfit

00:37.871 --> 00:39.873
for when Granddad Shay
visits next week.

00:39.973 --> 00:42.042
I'm hoping if I dress
like an old person,

00:42.143 --> 00:43.311
it'll help us bond.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.712
I'm also gonna dye
my hair white.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.247
Why would you do that
when you could just stop

00:46.347 --> 00:48.015
dying it brown?

00:49.150 --> 00:50.351
Just be cool.

00:50.451 --> 00:51.819
We haven't seen Granddad
in forever,

00:51.919 --> 00:54.155
and I really want this visit
to be a good time.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.889
He's like the only family
we have.

00:57.125 --> 00:58.359
He's not the only
family we have.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.060
We also have dad
and that lady

01:00.161 --> 01:02.363
who claimed to be our sister
right when she needed a kidney.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.470
Granddad?
What are you doing here?

01:10.571 --> 01:12.740
I realize I'm a week early.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.776
Traffic was a lot better
than I expected.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.012
- Oh, Carly!

01:19.113 --> 01:20.448
My little gumdrop.

01:20.548 --> 01:23.417
It's been quite a while.
I've really missed you.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.353
Aw, me too, Granddad.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.355
Spencer.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.990
So close, we don't even need
a nickname.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.092
Hey, let's all go around
and say what we like

01:32.193 --> 01:34.395
about each other's life choices.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.597
Patches on your elbows?

01:36.697 --> 01:39.133
- Huh?
- Oh, do you need a loan?

01:40.401 --> 01:42.470
No, Spencer spent two years

01:42.570 --> 01:44.972
decorating this
whole place himself.

01:45.072 --> 01:48.075
He picked all the furniture,
every tabletop,

01:48.176 --> 01:49.443
every light fixture.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.044
Impressive.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.581
I did two tours in Vietnam.

01:53.681 --> 01:54.948
Well, I haven't just decorated.

01:55.048 --> 01:56.550
Lately I've been spending
most of my time

01:56.650 --> 01:58.386
focusing on my new business.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.788
That's right,
I have a business.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.055
It's new.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.957
I do business there.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.530
You wanna see
my coin collection?

02:40.994 --> 02:43.197
What do you need,
Radical Rosemary?

02:43.297 --> 02:45.433
More water?
Less water?

02:45.533 --> 02:47.401
Sparkling water?
Use your words!

02:48.769 --> 02:52.072
I'm so busy.
Work texts, PlantCam,

02:52.172 --> 02:54.208
shopping for wigs that,
let's face it,

02:54.308 --> 02:56.143
I'm never gonna buy.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.746
Harper keeps saying
that I should get an assistant.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.081
But it usually only comes up
when it's her turn

03:01.181 --> 03:02.750
to unload the dishwasher.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.720
I just wish I had more time
to spend with you, Granddad.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.456
Don't worry about me, Carly.

03:08.556 --> 03:11.525
Since I retired, I've gotten
used to being lonely and bored.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.494
I spend most of my days
watching re-runs

03:13.594 --> 03:16.330
of Third Rock from the Sun.

03:16.430 --> 03:17.698
Let me go
through my schedule

03:17.798 --> 03:20.100
and find time for us
to spend together.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.936
Uh... no.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.137
Not then.

03:25.138 --> 03:28.476
Why did I write "panic attack"
with a smiley face?

03:28.576 --> 03:30.644
Carly, you have no system.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.846
Here, let me
show you mine.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.884
Those all just say
"watch Third Rock from the Sun."

03:36.984 --> 03:38.352
If they stop

03:38.452 --> 03:40.020
rerunning that show,
I don't know what I'll do.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.957
Granddad, that system
is actually amazing.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.094
Wait.
You should be my assistant!

03:47.194 --> 03:48.496
Think about it.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.031
You're bored,
you're super organized,

03:51.131 --> 03:53.467
and you love unloading
the dishwasher.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.202
Unless you think
it'd be weird?

03:55.303 --> 03:58.339
No, I think it'd be a great way
for us to spend time together.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.308
I'll start right now.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.042
Clock me in, Gumdrop.

04:02.142 --> 04:03.577
Also, when's lunch?

04:06.013 --> 04:07.748
Why do you need
to call your doctor

04:07.848 --> 04:09.517
about an irregular cycle?

04:09.617 --> 04:12.453
Is your Peloton broken?

04:12.553 --> 04:15.289
There it is.
There's the weird part.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.595
Now, the menu
is not finalized yet,

04:21.695 --> 04:22.830
but check this out.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.065
I took my smoothie pops,
aka "smops,"

04:25.165 --> 04:27.100
and I made them
with juice.

04:27.200 --> 04:30.137
Behold the J-Smop!

04:33.707 --> 04:36.209
So, they're just Popsicles?

04:36.310 --> 04:38.779
Yeah, but I copyrighted J-Smops.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.214
Okay, I have to go.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.183
I'm auditioning hamsters
for a therapy position,

04:43.283 --> 04:44.552
and parking's a nightmare.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.286
How do you audition hamsters
for therapy?

04:46.387 --> 04:47.788
Oh, you'd be surprised.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.257
Some hamsters can be
more empathetic than others.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.225
I'm just kidding.
I buy a bunch of hamsters,

04:52.326 --> 04:54.762
and the ones who don't run away
get the gig.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.097
Yeah, you better go.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.499
Finding a parking spot
in Seattle

04:58.599 --> 04:59.833
is like finding
a quiet Aries.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.202
Right.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.204
So true!

05:05.806 --> 05:08.342
Don't even get me started
on how an Aries gets gas!

05:11.078 --> 05:13.146
Okay, I'll see you guys later.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.816
- Okay, bye-bye.
-Bye, Pearl.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.418
Total Aquarius move.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.087
- Not that he would know.
- Yeah, not that he would know.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.290
Agreeing with Millicent
makes me feel young.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.693
Pearl loves astrology

05:25.793 --> 05:27.160
and I want to be able
to talk to her about it.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.997
Ooh, let me do
your birth chart.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.433
It's like the old saying,
"Teach a man to fish

05:32.533 --> 05:33.667
and he'll catch a Pisces."

05:35.636 --> 05:37.237
Ooh, girl,
let me catch a breath!

05:37.337 --> 05:40.441
That is fully hilarious
for those in the know.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.512
Just plug in the time
and location of your birth,

05:44.612 --> 05:45.913
and your mother's
pelvic angle.

05:46.013 --> 05:49.517
Thirty-one degrees.
Very auspicious angle.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.752
Very sad I know that.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.823
Huh.

05:55.923 --> 05:59.126
Moon.
Pisces.

05:59.226 --> 06:00.894
The Fourth House?!

06:00.994 --> 06:04.465
Oh, this is bad.
Bad, bad, bad.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.300
What?
Does it say I'm gonna die?

06:07.401 --> 06:08.902
Worse!
Your birth chart

06:09.002 --> 06:11.204
is a perfect match
to my birth chart.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.640
We're soul mates.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.842
What?

06:14.942 --> 06:16.877
- No, we're not.
- I know!

06:16.977 --> 06:18.612
I mean,
she is so out of your league.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.013
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.282
You're lucky Harper
even knows your name.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.787
Come on, Harper.
This whole thing is bogus.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.591
Your skepticism
balancing my whimsy?

06:30.691 --> 06:32.092
But of course.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.628
We're perfect
for each other.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.098
Are you crying?

06:38.198 --> 06:41.869
Damn you, Mom,
and your scheduled C-section.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.705
This J-Smop is hitting.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.079
I'm working, not shopping!

06:52.179 --> 06:55.683
Not for your lowly assistant
to judge, but here goes.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.951
Those shoes are ugly.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.789
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

07:01.889 --> 07:03.591
- I am kinda hungry.
- Ah.

07:03.691 --> 07:07.661
You could have one of
my pre-prepared morning snacks.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.630
FYI, they're all yogurt.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.699
It helps me go.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.233
Key lime pie?

07:13.333 --> 07:15.903
Granddad, you are begging
for a promotion.

07:16.003 --> 07:19.540
And I booked you a collab.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.841
- Seriously?
- Mm.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.543
I'm surprised you know
what a collab is.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.545
I looked up a list
of young words on the web.

07:24.645 --> 07:27.380
I do not wanna be a cheugy!

07:27.481 --> 07:29.182
So, who's the collab with?

07:29.282 --> 07:31.084
Me and the coins.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.855
Hmm.
Let me think about it.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.158
I'll get that.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.360
That's your assistant's job.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.996
Carly Shay's office.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.598
Pot guy?

07:44.698 --> 07:46.667
My granddaughter
is not a druggie!

07:46.767 --> 07:49.803
The '60s are over!
You lost!

07:51.404 --> 07:55.142
It's not the pot guy,
it's my pottery guy.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.277
- Oh.
- My babies
are finally growing up

07:57.377 --> 07:59.079
and gonna be able to move
into bigger homes.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.549
Oh.
Sorry I messed up that call.

08:01.649 --> 08:04.384
You know, I could use a list
of my job responsibilities.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.486
Sure, I'll write something up
for you later.

08:06.587 --> 08:07.921
how 'bout you type it up now?

08:08.021 --> 08:10.357
Size 84 font.
None of that sans serif crap.

08:10.457 --> 08:12.560
And while you're up,
I'll take a Werther's

08:12.660 --> 08:14.828
and a cup for my teeth.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.741
Ah, your steak au poivre
at00 in the morning.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.977
I have no follow-up questions.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.713
It's for Granddad.
I made him my assistant

08:32.813 --> 08:33.947
so we can spend
more time together.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.649
Then why are you
getting him a steak?

08:35.749 --> 08:39.186
I guess I somehow kind of
became his assistant.

08:39.286 --> 08:42.255
No fair,
he always picks you!

08:43.156 --> 08:45.025
You know what,
why don't I have Granddad

08:45.125 --> 08:46.526
come here and have lunch?

08:46.627 --> 08:48.195
Then, you can show him
the restaurant

08:48.295 --> 08:49.730
and he can show you his teeth.

08:49.830 --> 08:53.033
Which reminds me,
can I get a thick, clear cup?

08:53.967 --> 08:56.403
Granddad can't come here,
he'll rip this place apart.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.538
I at least need to paint
a mural on that wall.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.473
You're right.
Granddad will probably look

09:00.574 --> 09:02.576
at that blank wall and be all,
"In my day,

09:02.676 --> 09:04.244
"we didn't have blank walls.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.547
We had one bone and we made
five weeks of soup out of it."

09:08.682 --> 09:11.551
Hey, Carly.
Are you mad at me?

09:11.652 --> 09:13.654
- No, why?
- Because I asked you

09:13.754 --> 09:15.589
if you wanted anything
from the grocery store earlier,

09:15.689 --> 09:19.760
and you replied,
"No. Period. Bye. Period."

09:19.860 --> 09:21.261
Oh, no.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.563
Granddad must be replying
to my texts from my computer.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.398
- Mm.
- Everyone knows old people

09:25.498 --> 09:26.834
are the worst texters.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.836
They don't get
digital nuance.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.739
Yeah, well, he's also yelling at
people in the iCarly comments.

09:31.839 --> 09:34.374
He's logged in as you and it
looks like you told someone

09:34.474 --> 09:36.176
to go die in a jalopy fire.

09:36.276 --> 09:39.880
I don't know what a jalopy is,
but the rest sounds pretty mean.

09:39.980 --> 09:43.050
What am I gonna do?
I can't fire my own Granddad.

09:44.484 --> 09:47.554
One banana almond smoothie
with five strawberries

09:47.655 --> 09:49.556
- and a splash of apple juice.
- That's mine.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.524
I ordered the same thing.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.293
That doesn't mean
we're soul mates.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.863
- You guys want straws?
-No straw, long spoon.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.666
I told you!

09:58.766 --> 10:03.871
Our two hearts beat as one,
you gorgeous dumbass.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.276
Wow, Granddad Shay,

10:09.376 --> 10:12.212
that was a really interesting
coin presentation.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.681
Thank you, young lady.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.548
Guess you could say
I'm a "coin-fluencer."

10:15.649 --> 10:17.584
You're a real
"coin-tent creator."

10:19.086 --> 10:21.621
Look at that,
we both coined new phrases!

10:21.722 --> 10:23.691
And that's it for
our first episode of...

10:23.791 --> 10:25.893
My Two Cents!

10:30.197 --> 10:31.498
"Coin-tent creator"?

10:31.598 --> 10:33.166
Not my proudest moment.

10:33.266 --> 10:36.469
But he pays me $20 every time
I laugh at one of his jokes.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.739
And say what you will,

10:38.839 --> 10:40.908
Granddad brought a ton
of viewers to your livestream.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.876
Way more than you usually get.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.846
You filmed that
on my livestream?

10:45.946 --> 10:48.148
Well, what happened
to my PlantCam?

10:48.248 --> 10:50.417
Turns out there
was a change of "plants."

10:56.523 --> 10:59.059
Granddad, this is my channel.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.228
Do you think Oprah
lets her granddad

11:01.328 --> 11:02.595
do coin shows on OWN?

11:02.696 --> 11:04.732
No, and that's
the only difference

11:04.832 --> 11:07.100
between you and Oprah.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.401
Thank you, Carly.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.870
For the first time
since I retired,

11:09.970 --> 11:13.040
I feel a real sense
of accomplishment.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.008
Actually, the first time
was last week at Skybucks

11:15.108 --> 11:18.779
when I successfully ordered
a frappuccino.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.914
Well, I don't wanna take it
away from you

11:21.014 --> 11:24.251
if you're really enjoying
making these coin videos.

11:25.085 --> 11:28.488
Maybe we can do a collab.
Your coins, my plants?

11:28.588 --> 11:30.223
Pass.

11:30.323 --> 11:32.993
Actually, Granddad and I have
a list of stuff for you to do

11:33.093 --> 11:34.728
while we rehearse
the next segment.

11:34.828 --> 11:39.699
It's an appreciation
of the 1787 Brasher Doubloon.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.302
People need to know
about the Brasher D.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.871
Do they?

11:45.205 --> 11:48.842
Of course, they do!
It's the Brasher D.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.213
I get 10 when I agree with him.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.151
Okay, what kind of
therapy animal would you suggest

11:58.251 --> 12:00.420
for a 49-year-old woman
with a fear of flying?

12:00.520 --> 12:04.057
Well, we could be responsible
and recommend a small dog.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.159
Ooh, or we could be bad,
give her a snake,

12:06.259 --> 12:08.996
and wind up with a plane
full of new customers.

12:09.797 --> 12:12.532
Pearl!
I have something to tell you.

12:12.632 --> 12:16.169
Fredward and I are soul mates.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.637
Excuse me?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.239
Harper did my birth chart

12:19.339 --> 12:21.508
so I could learn more
about astrology to impress you,

12:21.608 --> 12:23.243
and our charts are a match.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.511
A perfect match.

12:24.611 --> 12:26.113
Can you please tell Harper

12:26.213 --> 12:27.747
that this doesn't
mean anything?

12:27.848 --> 12:29.349
I'm sorry,
but I can't do that.

12:29.449 --> 12:32.119
The stars have spoken,
and we must listen.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.653
What?!

12:33.753 --> 12:36.623
You're very practical.
Taurus?

12:36.723 --> 12:38.591
Yeah, dude.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.560
But I also did
Freddie's chart,

12:40.660 --> 12:42.262
and, well, your mom and I
have been texting

12:42.362 --> 12:44.164
ever since she put
a tracking device on my car.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.266
- But he and I,

12:46.366 --> 12:47.600
also a perfect match.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.171
Now, we just have to see
who matches with him physically.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.373
Only one way to do that.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.079
Here?
Now?

13:00.613 --> 13:02.149
The three of us?

13:03.383 --> 13:05.285
Salsa dancing.

13:05.385 --> 13:09.289
Wait, what did you think
we were talking about?

13:10.490 --> 13:12.392
Salsa dancing.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.228
Okay, so to recap.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.831
I'm a perfect match
for both of you.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.867
Two of us
want to date each other.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.202
Two of us have absolutely
no interest

13:22.302 --> 13:23.603
in dating each other,

13:23.703 --> 13:27.875
and we're gonna solve this
with salsa dancing?

13:27.975 --> 13:30.410
Well, you wouldn't solve it
with a Viennese waltz.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.879
That would be insane.

13:35.849 --> 13:38.685
I'm not the coin-fluencer's
assistant!

13:38.785 --> 13:41.154
He's my assistant!

13:41.254 --> 13:43.690
I agree,
it's not going well!

13:44.958 --> 13:46.226
What are you doing?

13:46.326 --> 13:47.694
I am swamped.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.662
Granddad gave out
my email on the show.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.900
Can you believe that?
He knows my email.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.434
I thought Millicent
was his assistant.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.137
Nah, she's his number one,
I'm his number two,

13:57.237 --> 13:59.839
and you're kind of like
our intern.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.674
It's kind of amazing
the show is so popular.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.443
Mm, not really.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.878
They come
for the buffalo nickels,

14:04.978 --> 14:07.981
but they stay for
the silver fox.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.250
Apparently, Granddad is hot.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.853
Spencer, I'm forwarding
Granddad's emails to Carly.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.188
You're not responding
fast enough,

14:15.288 --> 14:17.057
and your tone
could use some work.

14:17.157 --> 14:20.393
Fine, let's see
if Granddad's Gumdrop

14:20.493 --> 14:22.195
can handle the deluge!

14:24.531 --> 14:25.765
Ugh!

14:25.865 --> 14:28.035
Granddad, we need to talk.

14:28.135 --> 14:30.904
Oh, Mr. Shay
can spare 20 minutes

14:31.004 --> 14:32.705
Thursday of next week.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.477
This isn't working.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.613
All I wanted was to spend
quality time with you.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.316
But, I'm sorry.

14:43.416 --> 14:46.886
I have to... fire you.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.058
Pack your bags.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.061
Please.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.965
You're firing me? Huh?

14:58.065 --> 15:00.133
That's an interesting
wrong decision.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.335
After I answer

15:02.435 --> 15:03.570
these last few emails.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.272
I don't wanna leave you
in a lurch.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.773
Who is Vinny?

15:06.873 --> 15:08.375
He's an old friend.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.678
Why does he say he's going
to "quaff you in the noof"?

15:11.778 --> 15:13.080
Oh, wait.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.048
"Sorry for the typos.
I'm driving.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.951
Meant to say I'm gonna
stab you in the neck."

15:19.219 --> 15:21.088
He's like an old friend
and an enemy.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.123
I wish there was
a colloquial term

15:23.223 --> 15:26.126
to describe that relationship.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.061
He also thinks
I stole my coins from him.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.329
Well, why would he think that?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.098
Because I stole
my coins from him.

15:31.198 --> 15:32.832
I lost them to Vinny
in a poker game,

15:32.932 --> 15:35.102
so I broke into his place
and took them back.

15:35.202 --> 15:38.405
Coin heists?
Nemesis?!

15:39.306 --> 15:43.043
If you're a supervillain,
you have to tell me.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.682
Granddad, you have to give
the coins back to Vinny.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.084
He's on his way here
to kill you.

15:51.184 --> 15:54.021
You mean us.
Vinny's not big on witnesses.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.922
I'm not giving these coins back.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.890
They've been in the family
for generations.

15:57.991 --> 16:01.661
Your great-great-grandfather
stole 'em fair and square.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.431
You're gonna risk
your life over coins?

16:04.531 --> 16:06.966
It's not like
they're front row tickets

16:07.067 --> 16:08.635
to Ricky Martin.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.306
Vinny is not murdering Granddad.

16:13.406 --> 16:16.643
If Granddad is gonna die, it is
gonna be from natural causes

16:16.743 --> 16:18.478
or falling into a pond
and drowning

16:18.578 --> 16:20.647
'cause he was trying
to feed a specific duck.

16:20.747 --> 16:24.084
I'll think of a way out of this.
Just leave it all to me.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.852
Spencer, I really appreciate

16:25.952 --> 16:27.620
you helping out
your old Granddad.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.356
And if you pull this off,

16:29.456 --> 16:31.358
there is a crisp
twenty-dollar bill

16:31.458 --> 16:32.659
with your name on it.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.227
Wait,
so saving your life

16:34.327 --> 16:36.129
and laughing at your jokes
gets the same amount?

16:36.229 --> 16:38.465
Carly, shut up.
I want those twenty bones.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.838
Thanks for letting us have
salsa night at your place.

16:45.938 --> 16:49.076
Well, thank you for being
a part of my plan.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.244
What plan?

16:51.344 --> 16:53.580
My secret plan.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.782
If you're gonna do
a dramatic pause,

16:55.882 --> 16:58.151
it's always best
to do it with a...

16:59.252 --> 17:00.620
...prop.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.292
Isn't Spencer's restaurant
great?

17:05.392 --> 17:07.194
I like the cool blank wall.

17:07.294 --> 17:10.697
I feel like it's saying,
"Hey guys, I'm just a wall.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.633
So, why doesn't everybody
chill out and move on?"

17:13.733 --> 17:15.034
I call it lazy.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.503
In my day,
you had a blank wall,

17:16.603 --> 17:19.372
you put up a sign
to "Join the Army."

17:19.472 --> 17:20.873
It won't be blank for long.

17:20.973 --> 17:24.444
It's all part of the...
plan.

17:29.516 --> 17:30.883
What the hell are you wearing?

17:30.983 --> 17:34.587
These are my custom-made
Spencer Shay salsa slacks.

17:38.591 --> 17:42.195
Wait, are those my coins
sewn into your pants?

17:42.295 --> 17:44.364
They're slacks, and yeah,

17:44.464 --> 17:47.534
it's all part
of the... plan.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.769
How are they...

17:51.003 --> 17:52.772
Oh no, Vinny's here.
I'm dead.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.844
He looks both frail and scary,

17:57.944 --> 18:00.647
so I'm relieved,
but still terrified.

18:04.584 --> 18:08.020
And now... I dance.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.689
Spencer, if he sees
your pants...

18:09.789 --> 18:11.624
It's part of the plan!

18:16.929 --> 18:19.199
- Give me my coins back.
- What coins?

18:19.299 --> 18:20.967
The coins on your
coin collecting show,

18:21.067 --> 18:23.770
which I watched
and really enjoyed, by the way.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.473
Hey, here's a fun
different topic

18:26.573 --> 18:29.442
to help us all
forget about coins.

18:29.542 --> 18:33.880
Can you believe they have
women pilots now?

18:35.882 --> 18:37.750
Well, I'm ready
for salsa dancing

18:37.850 --> 18:39.152
to decide
who I'm compatible with,

18:39.252 --> 18:41.254
even though I've already
decided I like Pearl,

18:41.354 --> 18:43.055
and astrology is ridiculous.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.625
He still thinks
it's up to him.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.295
Oh, God, I hope we suck at this.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.530
Not as much as I do.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.319
Damn it, we're great at this.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.856
You'll pry those coins
out of my cold, dead fingers.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.559
I'll do it when your fingers
are warm.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.128
It takes two hours
for a body to cool down.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.333
That Lena Horne
is some hot dish, huh?

19:29.536 --> 19:30.670
Who is this kid?

19:30.770 --> 19:32.071
He's my grandson,

19:32.171 --> 19:34.173
and I'm as disappointed
as you think I am.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.877
Spencer, if Vinny
sees your pants,

19:37.977 --> 19:39.279
he's gonna know
where the coins are.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.147
You gotta get out of here.

19:44.984 --> 19:47.354
And now... we dance.

19:55.695 --> 19:56.896
Our turn.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.298
Let's dance
like nobody's watching,

19:58.398 --> 20:00.199
even though people are.

20:14.180 --> 20:17.684
Look at them, working out
their problems through dance.

20:17.784 --> 20:20.587
Why don't you guys try that?

20:20.687 --> 20:22.188
Help less, Gumdrop.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.559
All right, let's finish this.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.195
See if you can handle
some of my signature moves.

20:45.044 --> 20:47.347
Why?!

20:59.158 --> 21:00.192
Ah!

21:01.494 --> 21:02.962
Freddie!

21:03.062 --> 21:06.165
Do you know what this means?
We're a match!

21:07.133 --> 21:08.435
Ooh!

21:08.535 --> 21:10.202
Hold up, hold on.

21:11.170 --> 21:12.805
Hey, girl, what's your sign?

21:12.905 --> 21:15.007
Libra with a Leo rising.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.345
Ooh, I'm a Sag
with a Libra rising!

21:18.445 --> 21:19.846
We're compatible!

21:19.946 --> 21:22.081
I'm good.
Freddie's all you.

21:24.351 --> 21:26.753
All right,
enough pleasantries.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.621
Time for murder.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.990
No, Vinny, wait!

21:34.594 --> 21:36.329
Your coins are on these pants!

21:37.464 --> 21:40.132
You're lucky the little lady
stepped in, Shay,

21:40.232 --> 21:42.134
because you were about to tango

21:42.234 --> 21:45.738
with Osteo
and Porosis.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.943
Thanks for saving my butt, guys.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.346
Unfortunately,
I can't pass those coins

21:53.446 --> 21:54.614
down to you after all.

21:54.714 --> 21:57.450
Actually, I think
you'll still be able to.

22:00.286 --> 22:02.689
The coins will be hidden
in plain sight

22:02.789 --> 22:04.290
at Shay What forever.

22:04.391 --> 22:07.026
Wait, then what was sewn
into your pants?

22:07.126 --> 22:12.064
Oh, my custom-made
Spencer Shay fake coins.

22:12.164 --> 22:16.002
All part of my... scheme.

22:16.102 --> 22:17.904
Great job, Spencer.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.540
Spencer, oh-ho!

22:20.640 --> 22:23.743
I'm proud of you.
There, I said it.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.045
Proud of me?

22:27.547 --> 22:31.250
I'm just... so happy...

22:32.284 --> 22:34.987
My whole life...
Family hug!

22:37.757 --> 22:41.160
Spencer, Carly,
you "coin" always count on me.

22:51.137 --> 22:53.239
Are you sure you wanna drive
back to Yakima tonight?

22:53.339 --> 22:55.307
I don't want
to overstay my welcome.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.376

23:05.284 --> 23:07.319
