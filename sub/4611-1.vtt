<u><b> <i>Rip made by ForsakeN</u></b></i>

00:41.877 --> 00:44.072
<i>Once upon a time, a long time ago,</i>

00:44.237 --> 00:47.593
<i>a king and queen had a
beautiful daughter named Fiona.</i>

00:47.757 --> 00:50.351
<i>But she was possessed
by a terrible curse.</i>

00:50.517 --> 00:54.954
<i>By day, a lovely princess.
By night, a hideous ogre.</i>

00:55.117 --> 00:57.756
<i>Only true love's kiss
could lift her curse.</i>

00:57.917 --> 01:01.910
<i>So Fiona waited in a tower,
guarded by a dragon, until the day</i>

01:02.077 --> 01:04.671
<i>when her true love would arrive.</i>

01:04.837 --> 01:07.067
<i>But as the days turned into years,</i>

01:07.237 --> 01:11.025
<i>the King and Queen were forced
to resort to more desperate measures.</i>

02:00.797 --> 02:02.469
Whoa, there.

02:03.677 --> 02:05.429
I don't know about this, Lillian.

02:05.597 --> 02:09.749
Fairy Godmother said only true love's
kiss could break Fiona's curse.

02:09.957 --> 02:14.030
I don't trust that woman, Harold.
This may be our last hope.

02:14.197 --> 02:17.189
Besides, he does come
highly recommended by King Midas.

02:17.357 --> 02:21.794
But to put our daughter's life
in the hands of this... person?

02:21.957 --> 02:26.473
He's devious.
He's deceitful. He's, he's...

02:26.637 --> 02:28.912
Rumpelstiltskin!

02:32.597 --> 02:34.076
Mrs. Highness.

02:34.677 --> 02:36.030
How do you do?

02:37.877 --> 02:39.549
Down, Fifi. Get down!

02:41.077 --> 02:43.875
As you can see, everything's in order.

02:44.037 --> 02:47.586
So you'll put an end
to our daughter's curse?

02:47.757 --> 02:51.909
And, in return, you sign the kingdom
of Far Far Away over to me.

02:57.717 --> 03:01.710
- Lillian, this is madness!
- What choice do we have?

03:01.877 --> 03:05.267
Fiona has been locked away
in that tower far too long.

03:05.437 --> 03:07.428
It's not like she's getting any younger.

03:07.597 --> 03:10.157
But to sign over our entire kingdom?

03:10.317 --> 03:13.115
Well, if your kingdom's worth
more to you than your daughter...

03:13.277 --> 03:16.747
Nothing is worth more to us
than our daughter.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.550
Jump, Fifi, jump!

03:27.477 --> 03:31.152
Just sign it and all your problems
will disappear.

03:40.437 --> 03:43.634
Your Highness! The Princess!
She's been saved!

03:48.437 --> 03:49.870
Who saved her?

03:50.597 --> 03:53.270
<i>No one would have guessed
that an ogre named Shrek,</i>

03:53.437 --> 03:55.428
<i>whose roar was feared
throughout the land,</i>

03:55.597 --> 03:58.157
<i>would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.</i>

03:58.317 --> 04:01.150
<i>True love's kiss led to marriage
and ogre babies!</i>

04:01.317 --> 04:04.309
<i>The kingdom of Far Far Away
was finally at peace.</i>

04:04.477 --> 04:08.675
<i>Goody for them!
And they lived happily ever after!</i>

04:10.197 --> 04:12.870
Sir? You're gonna
have to pay for that.

04:14.197 --> 04:16.630
Maybe we could make a deal
for it, little boy?

04:16.797 --> 04:20.346
- Oh, I'm not a real boy.
- Do you want to be?

04:22.837 --> 04:26.989
Nobody needs your deals
anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!

04:32.757 --> 04:36.113
I wish that ogre was never born!

04:47.677 --> 04:49.793
Wake up, Daddy, wake up!

04:50.517 --> 04:53.554
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.

04:56.517 --> 04:58.030
Better out than in.

04:58.717 --> 04:59.866
That's my line.

05:00.037 --> 05:02.870
Did my little Fergus make a...

05:03.037 --> 05:06.154
...big, grownup ogre stink?!

05:06.317 --> 05:09.389
Oh, that's diabolical!

05:11.517 --> 05:14.509
And on your left, the lovable lug
that showed us you don't have to

05:14.677 --> 05:16.952
change your undies
to change the world!

05:18.117 --> 05:20.153
I wonder what Shrek's up to in there.

05:20.317 --> 05:23.468
Get in there. Get...
Impossible to put on!

05:24.357 --> 05:27.588
OK, the dragon goes under the bridge,
through the loop...

05:27.757 --> 05:30.032
...and finally, into the castle.

05:35.317 --> 05:36.466
Play date!

05:43.157 --> 05:45.273
Then Shrek kissed the Princess.

05:45.437 --> 05:47.393
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

05:47.557 --> 05:48.546
Happily...

05:48.717 --> 05:50.116
- Ever...
- After.

05:56.517 --> 05:57.745
Look! A shooting star!

05:59.797 --> 06:01.788
So, what did you wish for?

06:01.957 --> 06:03.948
That every day could be like this one.

06:04.117 --> 06:05.516
Come here, you.

06:18.037 --> 06:19.265
Morning, Daddy.

06:19.437 --> 06:20.506
Morning.

06:22.677 --> 06:23.792
Better out than in.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.669
Did my little Fergus make a...

06:29.877 --> 06:31.833
Cute. Real cute.

06:33.557 --> 06:34.672
This lovable lug taught us

06:34.837 --> 06:37.635
you don't have to change
your undies to change the world!

06:38.717 --> 06:39.706
Play date!

06:42.117 --> 06:44.631
Shrek! The outhouse is clogged up!

06:44.797 --> 06:47.630
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

06:47.797 --> 06:48.786
- Happily...
- Ever...

06:48.957 --> 06:49.946
After?

06:52.477 --> 06:54.672
- Daddy, get up!
- Morning.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.470
- Better out than in.
- This lovable lug...

07:00.237 --> 07:01.716
- Play date!
- No!

07:03.477 --> 07:04.671
Outhouse again!

07:04.837 --> 07:05.872
Come on.

07:09.637 --> 07:10.752
Undies!

07:12.517 --> 07:13.552
Outhouse!

07:13.717 --> 07:15.753
- Get up, get up!
- And they lived...

07:15.917 --> 07:17.316
- Happily...
- Ever...

07:17.477 --> 07:18.671
After.

08:07.317 --> 08:08.591
Roar.

08:55.877 --> 08:57.230
Nice landing, baby.

08:57.397 --> 08:59.672
Hey! Now remember, don't eat the valet.

09:01.037 --> 09:04.552
<i>Happy birthday, ninos!
Vamos a la fiesta!</i>

09:05.837 --> 09:07.395
Hey, Shrek, Shrek!

09:08.517 --> 09:11.031
Mr. Shrek, would you
sign our pitchforks?

09:11.197 --> 09:12.232
And our torches?

09:12.397 --> 09:14.035
Oh, man, you used to be so fierce!

09:14.197 --> 09:15.949
Yeah, when you were a real ogre!

09:16.117 --> 09:17.948
A real ogre?

09:28.957 --> 09:31.835
Shrek, it's a sing-along.
You've got to sing along!

09:31.997 --> 09:34.989
- No, thanks.
- Please? I'll be your best friend.

09:35.157 --> 09:39.435
Why does being your best friend entail
me doing everything I don't want to do?

09:39.597 --> 09:41.827
Please, Felicia, not in Daddy's ear.

09:41.997 --> 09:43.191
Excuse me, Mr. Shrek?

09:43.357 --> 09:45.427
Could you do that
ogre roar of yours for my son?

09:45.597 --> 09:47.030
He's a big, big fan.

09:47.197 --> 09:48.266
Do the roar.

09:48.437 --> 09:51.110
You know, I'd rather not.
It's my kids' birthday party.

09:51.277 --> 09:53.188
- Do the roar.
- Honey?

09:53.357 --> 09:54.631
Why don't you go check on the cake?

09:54.797 --> 09:58.028
- Sure.
- And don't forget the candles.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.186
Hold still.

09:59.357 --> 10:01.234
Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man.

10:01.397 --> 10:04.150
I always wanted chaps!
Yee-haw! Giddy up!

10:04.317 --> 10:05.636
- Monsieur Shrek.
- Howdy, Shrek!

10:05.797 --> 10:07.389
<i>Your cake. Voila!</i>

10:08.637 --> 10:11.709
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's Sprinkles the Ogre!

10:11.877 --> 10:14.152
Isn't he cute? He looks just like you.

10:14.317 --> 10:16.467
But happy. It's a party, Shrek.
You gotta cheer up!

10:16.637 --> 10:18.150
I'm in a great mood, actually.

10:18.317 --> 10:21.070
- Oh, I'm gonna lick me a rainbow!
- Donkey!

10:21.237 --> 10:22.352
As long as you're not doing anything,

10:22.517 --> 10:23.916
how about one of those
famous Shrek roars?

10:24.077 --> 10:26.511
- Do the roar.
- Let me set you straight, Butter Pants.

10:26.677 --> 10:29.111
An ogre only roars when he's angry.

10:29.277 --> 10:31.268
You don't want to see me angry, do you?

10:31.437 --> 10:32.665
Do it.

10:34.037 --> 10:35.834
Hold it together. Just hold it together.

10:35.997 --> 10:37.988
Daddy, he's getting away. Do something.

10:38.157 --> 10:39.385
Oh, good.

10:39.557 --> 10:42.913
- What happened to the cake?
- Trust me. It's an improvement.

10:43.077 --> 10:44.590
- You licked it!
- No.

10:44.757 --> 10:47.510
Just because you're an ogre,
doesn't mean you have to eat like one.

10:47.677 --> 10:49.872
Looks like you forgot the candles!

10:50.037 --> 10:52.187
OK, just watch the cake.
I'll go get them.

10:52.357 --> 10:53.585
Watch the cake?

10:54.197 --> 10:56.267
- Where's the cake?!
- We ate the cake.

10:56.437 --> 10:57.472
- Ya.
- What?

10:57.637 --> 10:58.831
No, don't cry.

10:58.997 --> 11:01.386
Hey! I believe you
promised my son a roar.

11:01.557 --> 11:02.910
- Do the roar.
- Roar.

11:03.077 --> 11:05.272
- I don't like it.
- Pigs, we need another cake.

11:05.437 --> 11:08.156
- We ate the other cakes.
- One roar, man.

11:08.317 --> 11:10.626
Hey, everybody!
Shrek's gonna do his famous ogre roar!

11:10.797 --> 11:13.391
Not now, Donkey.
Pigs, are there any cupcakes?

11:13.557 --> 11:15.354
- We ate them, too.
- They have lollipops.

11:15.517 --> 11:16.632
No, I ate them.

11:16.797 --> 11:19.391
- You didn't share?
- Well, you didn't share the croissants!

11:19.557 --> 11:22.435
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Shrek, what's going on?

11:22.597 --> 11:24.474
- Come on, Shrek, your fans are waiting!
- Do the roar.

11:26.197 --> 11:27.789
We need the cake!

11:29.077 --> 11:31.307
Cake! Cake! Cake!

11:45.757 --> 11:46.792
I love you, Daddy.

11:46.957 --> 11:49.551
Everybody, I have found another cake!

11:50.837 --> 11:52.793
Shrek? Are you OK?

12:19.397 --> 12:22.469
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it! Those villagers...

12:22.637 --> 12:25.834
I'm not talking about the villagers,
Shrek. I'm talking about you.

12:25.997 --> 12:28.875
Is this really how you want
to remember the kids' first birthday?

12:29.037 --> 12:32.871
- Oh, great. So this is all my fault?
- Yes. But you know what?

12:33.037 --> 12:34.993
Let's talk about this
after the party, at home.

12:35.157 --> 12:37.751
You mean that roadside
attraction we live in?

12:37.917 --> 12:42.229
Step right up! See the dancing ogre!
Don't worry! He won't bite!

12:42.397 --> 12:46.390
I used to be an ogre.
Now I'm just a jolly green joke!

12:46.557 --> 12:50.675
OK, OK, maybe you're not
the ogre you used to be.

12:50.837 --> 12:52.475
But maybe that's not such a bad thing.

12:52.637 --> 12:56.152
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
It's not like you're a real ogre.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.512
You spent half your life in a palace.

12:58.677 --> 13:01.111
And the other half
locked away in a tower.

13:02.517 --> 13:06.351
Look, all I want is for things to go
back to the way they used to be!

13:06.517 --> 13:11.068
Back when villagers were afraid of me,
and I could take a mud bath in peace.

13:11.237 --> 13:14.673
When I could do what I wanted,
when I wanted to do it!

13:14.837 --> 13:18.068
Back when the world made sense!

13:18.237 --> 13:20.797
You mean back before you
rescued me from the Dragon's Keep?

13:20.957 --> 13:22.276
Exactly!

13:27.877 --> 13:31.950
Shrek, you have
three beautiful children,

13:32.117 --> 13:34.187
a wife who loves you,

13:34.357 --> 13:38.236
friends who adore you.
You have everything.

13:40.597 --> 13:44.795
Why is it the only person
who can't see that is you?

14:04.757 --> 14:06.349
That's just great.

14:13.437 --> 14:15.268
If she thinks I'm gonna
slink back there and apologise,

14:16.517 --> 14:19.634
she's got another thing coming.
She's not the boss of me.

14:19.797 --> 14:23.472
I'm an ogre and I'm not gonna apologise
for acting like one.

14:23.637 --> 14:27.789
Help, please!
Someone, anyone at all, help me!

14:27.957 --> 14:29.629
Please, help!

14:30.077 --> 14:31.590
Please, help!

14:31.957 --> 14:33.675
I'm stuck! Help!

14:33.837 --> 14:35.589
Oh, please, help!

14:35.757 --> 14:38.430
Someone, anyone! Help me!

14:38.597 --> 14:41.953
The pain! I can see
a bright light. A tunnel!

14:42.837 --> 14:44.475
Grandma? Is that you?

14:44.637 --> 14:45.956
Yeah, it's me, Granny.

14:46.117 --> 14:49.553
An ogre! Please, Mr. Ogre,
please don't eat me!

14:49.717 --> 14:51.196
I'm not gonna eat you.

14:51.357 --> 14:54.508
But you are an ogre... Aren't you?

14:54.677 --> 14:57.396
Yeah, well, I... I used to be.

14:57.557 --> 14:59.866
Look, move out or get crushed.

15:00.037 --> 15:01.948
So you're not gonna eat me?

15:02.117 --> 15:06.747
No, thanks. I already had a big bowl
of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

15:08.117 --> 15:10.915
Wait up! What's your rush?
Where you going?

15:11.077 --> 15:12.066
Nowhere.

15:12.237 --> 15:14.797
What a coincidence!
I was just heading that way myself.

15:14.957 --> 15:19.269
But, seriously,
let me give you a ride. I insist.

15:19.437 --> 15:23.635
Come on. It's the least I can do
after all you've done for me.

15:25.157 --> 15:26.590
I got a hot rat cooking.

15:28.477 --> 15:31.992
All right! Can I interest you
in a mudslide? Slug and tonic?

15:32.157 --> 15:34.990
A liquid libation
to ease that frustration?

15:35.157 --> 15:39.275
- Eyeball-tini?
- Well, maybe just one.

15:40.157 --> 15:43.991
So the centaur says,
"That's not the half I'm talking about."

15:44.997 --> 15:47.591
I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you.

15:47.757 --> 15:50.954
To live the life of an ogre...
no worries, no responsibilities.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.756
You are free to pillage
and terrorise as you please.

15:53.917 --> 15:57.068
- Free? That's a laugh.
- Oh, yeah?

15:57.637 --> 16:02.586
Sometimes I wish I had just one day
to feel like a real ogre again.

16:02.757 --> 16:03.826
Why didn't you say so?

16:03.997 --> 16:07.034
Magical transactions are my specialty!

16:07.197 --> 16:10.746
Great. Next to mimes,
magicians are my favourite people.

16:11.677 --> 16:13.110
Hold on.

16:13.277 --> 16:16.314
"King for a Month."
"Knight for a Week."

16:19.557 --> 16:21.468
Ogre for a day.

16:23.037 --> 16:24.993
Think about it, Shrek.
To be feared and hated.

16:25.157 --> 16:26.146
You'll be, like, "Roar!"

16:26.317 --> 16:29.753
And the villagers will be, like, "Get
away! It's Shrek! I'm so scared of him!"

16:29.917 --> 16:33.148
It would be just like the good old days,
when your swamp was your castle.

16:33.317 --> 16:38.710
- When the world made sense.
- All right, what's the catch?

16:38.877 --> 16:42.392
Catch? No. There's no catch.
No catchings, really.

16:42.557 --> 16:44.548
I mean, there's something.
Small thing. Nothing. A little thing.

16:44.717 --> 16:47.595
All right, I knew it.
So what do you want?

16:47.757 --> 16:49.509
- A day.
- A day.

16:49.677 --> 16:50.666
Rat's done!

16:52.157 --> 16:55.194
To make the magic work, you gotta
give something to get something.

16:55.357 --> 16:58.155
In this case, you gotta
give a day to get a day. That's all.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.911
I can't just pick up
and leave my family.

17:01.077 --> 17:04.592
But that's the best part, Shrek!
It's a magical contract.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.509
No one will even know you're gone.

17:06.676 --> 17:12.229
And by the time this day is up,
you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.

17:13.156 --> 17:15.068
Still, I don't know.

17:15.237 --> 17:18.627
Hey, no problem.
Forget it, no big D. Doesn't matter.

17:18.797 --> 17:21.185
Do you like white meat or dark meat?

17:22.396 --> 17:25.275
So what day would I have to give up?

17:25.436 --> 17:28.190
I don't know, any day.
A day from your past.

17:28.357 --> 17:30.666
A day you had the flu?
A day you lost a pet?

17:30.837 --> 17:33.146
A day some meddling oaf
stuck his nose where it didn't belong

17:33.317 --> 17:34.875
destroying your business
and ruining your life?!

17:38.397 --> 17:39.796
Just for an example.

17:39.957 --> 17:41.629
How about the day I met Donkey?

17:41.797 --> 17:44.186
Now, there's a day
I'd like to take back.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.276
I don't know who that is.

17:47.077 --> 17:49.545
I know. What about a day
you wouldn't even remember?

17:49.717 --> 17:51.833
Like a day when you were a baby.

17:51.997 --> 17:57.025
- An innocent, mindless little baby.
- Take any of those days you want.

17:57.197 --> 18:01.395
- Take them all for all I care.
- Oh, just one will do.

18:02.717 --> 18:05.277
OK, good.
A day from your childhood it is.

18:05.437 --> 18:08.907
I guess there's nothing wrong
with wanting a little time for myself.

18:09.077 --> 18:10.556
Just 24 tiny little hours.

18:10.717 --> 18:12.708
- I'm still my own ogre!
- Yeah, you is!

18:12.877 --> 18:15.027
I never needed to ask
for anyone's permission before.

18:15.197 --> 18:17.757
So why start now?

18:26.077 --> 18:27.476
Go on, Shrek.

18:27.637 --> 18:29.116
Sign it!

18:30.157 --> 18:31.556
Go on, Shrek.

18:32.637 --> 18:34.116
Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!

18:35.997 --> 18:36.986
You signed it.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.830
So, tell me. What happens now?

18:39.997 --> 18:41.589
Have a nice day.

18:58.837 --> 19:01.146
I think I fell on my keys.

19:01.317 --> 19:02.545
<i>There are 40 children in that shoe,</i>

19:03.437 --> 19:05.428
which is why the weasel
goes pop to this very day.

19:05.597 --> 19:06.586
Oh, great.

19:06.757 --> 19:09.146
As we head over the river
and through the woods...

19:09.317 --> 19:10.306
Ogre!

19:32.837 --> 19:34.270
Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre!

20:25.757 --> 20:28.590
This is the part where you run away!

20:49.277 --> 20:51.666
Sure is great to be wanted again.

20:52.957 --> 20:54.390
Nice one.

21:02.717 --> 21:04.036
Fiona?

21:13.797 --> 21:15.230
Oh, no.

21:28.637 --> 21:30.229
My home.

21:31.517 --> 21:32.791
Fiona!

21:34.877 --> 21:37.596
Fiona! Are you in there?!

22:13.757 --> 22:15.827
All right, Rumpel!

22:16.477 --> 22:18.866
This wasn't part of the deal!

22:22.077 --> 22:23.510
Rumpel!

22:44.037 --> 22:45.993
Ogre!

22:47.037 --> 22:50.234
We've got another one, ladies! Get him!

22:51.717 --> 22:53.309
Who are you?!

22:53.477 --> 22:55.388
What are you doing in my swamp?

23:01.397 --> 23:03.513
Looks like a troublemaker!

23:15.557 --> 23:16.785
Spread 'em!

23:18.917 --> 23:20.953
Nice job, ladies!

23:28.197 --> 23:32.315
You witches are making a big mistake!
I know my rights!

23:32.477 --> 23:34.991
You have the right to shut your mouth!

23:53.757 --> 23:57.113
Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?

23:57.917 --> 23:59.191
Donkey!

24:08.157 --> 24:10.546
Donkey, where am I? What's happening?

24:10.717 --> 24:13.754
Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.

24:20.197 --> 24:22.870
I'm driving,
so I'm in charge of the music.

24:23.997 --> 24:26.716
Will you witches make up your mind?

24:35.157 --> 24:38.593
Donkey? What's going on?
Do you know where Fiona is?

24:39.197 --> 24:41.791
Quiet, ogre! You're gonna get me
in trouble and I need this job.

24:41.957 --> 24:43.549
I am not going back to work
for Old MacDonald.

24:43.717 --> 24:46.390
Tell me to E-l-E-l-O.
"E-l-E-l-No!" That's what I said.

24:46.557 --> 24:50.106
Where are my babies?
And where's your wife, Dragon?

24:50.277 --> 24:52.996
Look, I think you have me confused
with some other talking donkey.

24:53.157 --> 24:54.476
I've never seen you before in my life.

24:54.637 --> 24:57.105
Never seen me before?
Come on, Donkey!

24:57.277 --> 24:59.347
And how do you
know my name anyway?

24:59.517 --> 25:02.270
It's me, Shrek. Your best friend?

25:02.917 --> 25:04.270
A donkey and an ogre friends?

25:04.437 --> 25:06.587
That's the most
ridiculous thing I ever heard!

25:09.317 --> 25:11.706
Can you at least tell me
where they're taking me?

25:11.877 --> 25:14.914
To the same place they take
every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.

25:15.677 --> 25:18.635
- Stiltskin!
- I said quiet!

25:25.757 --> 25:28.351
Oh, no.

25:39.197 --> 25:41.757
It's time to crumble!

25:41.917 --> 25:46.069
<i>Place your bets!
Place your bets! We start tout de suite!</i>

25:46.237 --> 25:47.226
Yeah!

25:50.237 --> 25:51.556
Gingy?

25:55.357 --> 25:57.109
Gingy snap!

25:59.597 --> 26:00.586
There's one!

26:00.757 --> 26:02.395
Disgusting, filthy ogre!

26:03.037 --> 26:04.231
Hideous monster!

26:04.397 --> 26:05.955
Filthy, filthy creature!

26:06.117 --> 26:08.312
Disgusting creature!

26:33.317 --> 26:34.955
Move it!

26:51.357 --> 26:53.996
Don't worry, Donkey.
I'll get us our lives back.

26:54.157 --> 26:57.194
Yeah, right. Put a little mustard
on mine, Captain Crazy!

27:32.797 --> 27:34.549
Mr. Stiltskin?

27:36.517 --> 27:38.553
You got another customer.

27:38.917 --> 27:41.306
- Wolfie!
- Yes, Mr. Stiltskin.

27:41.477 --> 27:43.229
Bring me my business wig.

27:43.397 --> 27:45.513
Mr. Stiltskin, please!

27:48.317 --> 27:50.672
- OK, go.
- Please make me a real boy!

27:50.837 --> 27:54.068
Go away! Terms are
in the details, balsa boy.

27:54.237 --> 27:56.876
Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!

27:57.437 --> 27:58.711
Stiltskin!

28:00.037 --> 28:01.072
Shrek!

28:02.957 --> 28:04.356
There he is!

28:05.317 --> 28:06.670
So close!

28:07.397 --> 28:10.230
Have I been waiting for you!

28:11.077 --> 28:13.466
Ladies, this is the guy

28:13.637 --> 28:16.868
that made all of this possible!

28:17.917 --> 28:20.351
So, tell me, how are you
enjoying your day?

28:20.517 --> 28:23.509
All right, Rumpel, what's going on?
What have you done?

28:23.677 --> 28:26.714
No, Shrek, it's not what I've done.
It's what you've done.

28:26.877 --> 28:30.506
Thanks to you, the King and Queen
signed their kingdom over to me.

28:30.677 --> 28:32.030
They would never do that.

28:32.197 --> 28:36.634
They would if I promised them
all their problems would disappear.

28:38.077 --> 28:40.307
<i>And then they disappeared!</i>

28:49.277 --> 28:50.596
They would have done anything

28:50.757 --> 28:52.793
if they thought it would
end their daughter's curse.

28:52.957 --> 28:55.232
I ended Fiona's curse!

28:55.397 --> 28:58.594
How could you when you never existed?

28:58.757 --> 29:01.635
You better start making sense,
you dirty little man!

29:01.797 --> 29:03.992
Here, let me spell it out for you!

29:04.157 --> 29:08.309
You gave me a day from your past,
a day you couldn't even remember.

29:08.477 --> 29:12.516
A day when you were
an innocent, mindless little baby.

29:15.997 --> 29:17.510
You took the day I was born.

29:17.677 --> 29:20.555
No, Shrek. You gave it to me.

29:20.717 --> 29:24.107
Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin,
because when this day is up...

29:24.277 --> 29:26.871
But you haven't heard the best part.

29:27.037 --> 29:32.509
Since you were never born, once
this day comes to an end, so will you.

29:36.397 --> 29:37.955
Where's Fiona?

29:38.637 --> 29:39.786
Where's my family?

29:39.957 --> 29:43.029
Silly little ogre.
You don't get it, do you?

29:43.197 --> 29:45.631
You see, you were never born.

29:45.797 --> 29:47.833
You never met Fiona.

29:47.997 --> 29:51.433
Your kids don't exist.

29:54.197 --> 29:57.269
How's that for a metaphysical paradox?

29:59.037 --> 30:01.346
Looks like you got
exactly what you wanted!

30:02.317 --> 30:05.434
- Happy Ogre Day!
- Rumpel!

30:07.357 --> 30:08.585
Get him, witches!

30:18.677 --> 30:21.794
You know what'd help morale
around here? Flip-flop Fridays.

30:21.957 --> 30:24.517
Feet be comfortable
with the breeze on your toes.

30:31.237 --> 30:32.829
Come on, girls!

30:43.037 --> 30:46.586
Lock all the doors,
you worthless witches! Do it!

30:49.277 --> 30:50.835
I'll be right back, Donkey!

30:50.997 --> 30:54.273
I don't know you! I don't know him!

31:12.957 --> 31:14.868
I'm glad I'm not you.

31:19.357 --> 31:20.631
Help me! Help!

31:21.797 --> 31:22.786
Help!

31:30.877 --> 31:32.356
No, not my pretty ball!

31:36.637 --> 31:38.389
Watch out!

31:50.037 --> 31:51.026
Wolfie?

31:51.197 --> 31:53.427
My angry wig.

32:01.957 --> 32:04.949
Help! I've been kidnapped
by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!

32:05.117 --> 32:06.470
Donkey! Get off of me!

32:06.637 --> 32:09.435
Watch it with your pointy hooves!

32:16.197 --> 32:17.755
- Just take my wallet!
- Hey!

32:17.917 --> 32:19.828
I'm being ass-napped!

32:20.437 --> 32:21.552
Animal cruelty! Help!

32:21.717 --> 32:23.708
You need to calm down!

32:23.877 --> 32:24.992
I'm your friend.

32:25.717 --> 32:27.708
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?

32:28.637 --> 32:30.434
Good. I'm gonna let go...

32:30.597 --> 32:32.952
...right... now.

32:33.117 --> 32:35.551
Please! Eat my face last!
Send my hooves to my mama!

32:35.717 --> 32:38.072
Donkey! You've got to trust me.

32:38.237 --> 32:40.705
- Why should I trust you?
- Because...

32:40.877 --> 32:42.868
Because...

32:46.397 --> 32:47.671
OK.

33:23.957 --> 33:28.030
Fine! Go ahead!
Run away! Who needs you?

34:00.197 --> 34:02.757
I've never seen an ogre cry.

34:08.036 --> 34:09.675
I'm not crying.

34:09.837 --> 34:11.793
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cry all the time.

34:11.956 --> 34:14.755
Just thinking about my grandma,
or thinking about baby kittens,

34:14.917 --> 34:19.069
or my grandma kissing a baby kitten,
or a little baby grandma kitten.

34:20.357 --> 34:23.190
- That is so darn sad.
- I said, I'm not crying!

34:23.357 --> 34:25.154
Take it easy, I'm only trying to help.

34:25.317 --> 34:27.069
It's none of my business
why you're upset.

34:28.036 --> 34:29.311
By the way, why are you upset?

34:29.476 --> 34:32.230
I was tricked into signing something
I shouldn't have.

34:32.397 --> 34:34.592
You signed up for one of them
time-shares, huh?

34:34.757 --> 34:37.317
No. I signed this.

34:37.956 --> 34:40.346
You should never sign a contract
with Rumpelstiltskin!

34:40.516 --> 34:41.791
Yeah, I got that.

34:41.956 --> 34:43.868
- His fine print is crafty.
- I know.

34:44.036 --> 34:46.266
- His exit clauses are sneaky.
- Yeah, I...

34:47.077 --> 34:49.431
- What did you say?
- I'm talking about the exit clause.

34:49.597 --> 34:50.712
Used to be, you had to guess his name,

34:50.877 --> 34:52.708
but now everybody knows
who Rumpelstiltskin is.

34:52.877 --> 34:54.435
Donkey, I've read the fine print.

34:54.597 --> 34:56.827
There's nothing
about an exit clause in here.

34:56.996 --> 34:58.828
Well, you didn't expect him
to make it easy for you.

34:58.997 --> 35:01.147
Here, let me show you how it's done.

35:01.317 --> 35:02.750
I didn't spend all that time
around them witches

35:02.917 --> 35:04.509
without picking up a few tricks.

35:04.677 --> 35:06.793
Your tiny, little ogre brain
couldn't begin to comprehend

35:06.957 --> 35:09.152
the complexity
of my polygonic foldability skills.

35:09.317 --> 35:10.511
What are you doing?

35:10.677 --> 35:13.635
Hey, I can't get my origami on
unless you back off.

35:13.797 --> 35:16.948
Thank you. OK, here's what you
gotta do. You fold this piece here,

35:17.117 --> 35:19.392
make this letter match up here,
bring this corner here,

35:19.557 --> 35:23.550
and if you do it just right,
it will show you what to do. There!

35:23.717 --> 35:25.947
"Try Lou's Bliss."

35:28.837 --> 35:29.826
Who's Lou?

35:29.997 --> 35:31.715
Give me that!

35:36.837 --> 35:38.793
"True Love's Kiss."

35:40.997 --> 35:43.386
You have to take me to dinner first.

35:44.197 --> 35:47.234
"According to fairy tale law,
if not fully satisfied,

35:47.397 --> 35:50.753
true love's kiss will render
this contract null and void."

35:50.917 --> 35:54.273
Donkey, you did it! Look at you!

35:54.437 --> 35:59.033
If Fiona and I share true love's kiss,
I will get my life back!

35:59.197 --> 36:01.995
OK! This isn't a petting zoo!
So where is this Fiona?

36:03.557 --> 36:04.956
Well, that's just it, you see.

36:05.597 --> 36:06.916
I don't know.

36:07.077 --> 36:09.147
You know, when I lose something,
I always try to retrace my steps.

36:09.317 --> 36:11.547
So... where did you leave her last?

36:12.197 --> 36:14.267
The last time I saw her,

36:14.437 --> 36:16.997
I told her I wished
I'd never rescued her.

36:18.917 --> 36:21.909
- Oh, no.
- Shrek?

36:22.077 --> 36:24.545
Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek!

36:24.717 --> 36:26.753
What, are you crazy?
That's the Dragon's Keep!

36:26.917 --> 36:28.748
They keep dragons in there!

36:30.557 --> 36:31.910
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead!

36:32.077 --> 36:34.875
I'm gonna just hang back here
and find us some breakfast!

36:45.237 --> 36:46.431
Fiona!

37:20.197 --> 37:21.789
Oh, no.

37:32.277 --> 37:34.472
If I didn't save Fiona...

37:37.317 --> 37:38.955
...then who did?

37:49.077 --> 37:53.673
This is the favour Fiona was
supposed to give me on the day we met.

37:55.237 --> 37:57.193
It's a symbol of our love.

37:57.997 --> 37:59.066
Now smell it!

37:59.237 --> 38:01.034
Hey, man, get that dirty
favour out of my face!

38:01.197 --> 38:04.587
Your nose is the only chance
I have of tracking down my wife,

38:04.757 --> 38:07.225
so stop complaining and start smelling.

38:07.397 --> 38:08.796
Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!

38:08.957 --> 38:10.595
Do I look like a bloodhound to you?

38:10.757 --> 38:13.066
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a donkey, not a dog!

38:13.237 --> 38:15.876
If I was a dog, they'd call me Dog,
not Donkey!

38:16.037 --> 38:17.356
And another thing...

38:18.317 --> 38:19.716
Wait a minute.

38:20.357 --> 38:21.710
I think I got something.

38:22.317 --> 38:24.512
- Whatever it is, it's sweet.
- Fiona.

38:24.677 --> 38:26.235
Luscious and tasty.

38:26.397 --> 38:28.831
Hey! That's my wife
you're talking about.

38:30.357 --> 38:31.392
Donkey!

38:35.237 --> 38:37.228
Yeah! Waffles!

38:37.397 --> 38:40.230
And I thought the Waffle Fairy
was just a bedtime story.

38:40.757 --> 38:44.193
Sticky stacks of golden,
syrupy deliciousness!

38:44.357 --> 38:46.427
Donkey! Don't eat that!

38:46.597 --> 38:50.556
There's a stack of freshly made waffles
in the middle of the forest.

38:50.717 --> 38:52.514
Don't you find that
a wee bit suspicious?

38:53.237 --> 38:55.307
Oh, you... I'm just... What are you?

38:55.477 --> 38:57.354
Bad Donkey! Mustn't.

38:57.517 --> 39:01.396
I said, don't! Don't!
No! Get away from it.

39:02.277 --> 39:03.266
You did.

39:10.117 --> 39:11.186
Look out!

39:14.157 --> 39:15.146
Donkey!

39:15.317 --> 39:17.626
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

39:19.717 --> 39:20.752
Donkey.

39:23.157 --> 39:24.670
Help! Help me!

39:24.837 --> 39:27.476
Help, Shrek! Help!

39:50.277 --> 39:51.426
Watch your head.

39:51.637 --> 39:52.911
Hey, it's a new guy!

39:53.077 --> 39:55.113
Look at him, all dressed up
in his Sunday vest.

39:55.277 --> 39:56.949
He's really tiny, isn't he?

39:57.117 --> 39:59.108
Yeah. Fate has delivered us
a comrade-in-arms

39:59.277 --> 40:00.835
and for that, we are thankful.
Suit him up!

40:00.997 --> 40:02.874
- Let's go, greenie.
- Now, wait a minute!

40:07.637 --> 40:09.389
- Hey!
- Here you go.

40:14.477 --> 40:17.150
- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?

40:17.317 --> 40:20.753
We fight for freedom
and ogres everywhere!

40:29.837 --> 40:31.395
I didn't know we could do that.

40:31.557 --> 40:33.946
Help! You can't eat me! I got the mange!

40:34.117 --> 40:38.395
- I'm poisonous! I'm all poi...
- I'll take him! This order's to go.

40:38.557 --> 40:40.866
Hey! I haven't removed his giblets yet.

40:41.037 --> 40:43.107
Trust me, you don't want
to eat this one.

40:43.277 --> 40:45.233
I go down smooth,
but come out fighting!

40:45.397 --> 40:47.388
- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.

40:47.557 --> 40:48.592
Your dinner is my friend!

40:48.757 --> 40:50.793
- Come on, guys!
- I got to get the giblets out!

40:50.957 --> 40:52.868
- She's back.
- There she is.

41:09.997 --> 41:11.032
Fiona!

41:13.077 --> 41:15.068
I'm so happy I found you!

41:22.917 --> 41:24.236
Maybe you missed orientation,

41:24.397 --> 41:27.753
but for future reference,
personal space is very important to me.

41:28.997 --> 41:30.749
You don't know who I am, do you?

41:30.917 --> 41:32.350
No.

41:32.517 --> 41:34.428
Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away.

41:34.597 --> 41:36.667
Gather the others
and meet me in the war room.

41:36.837 --> 41:39.226
Gretched, make sure everyone
is prepared to move out tonight.

41:39.397 --> 41:41.274
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?

41:41.437 --> 41:45.794
OK, I know you don't
remember me, but...

41:45.957 --> 41:47.948
...we're married. Hear me out.

41:48.117 --> 41:50.756
And at the birthday party
with some pigs and a puppet,

41:50.917 --> 41:52.270
the villagers wanted me
to sign their pitchforks,

41:52.437 --> 41:54.393
and this boy kept saying,
"Do the roar."

41:54.557 --> 41:56.866
Then I punched the cakes that the
pigs ate and the next thing I knew,

41:57.037 --> 41:59.267
my donkey fell in your waffle hole.

42:01.717 --> 42:04.106
Right? Who's with me?

42:05.797 --> 42:08.311
I guess I must have kicked him
harder than I thought.

42:08.477 --> 42:10.593
Fiona, I need to...

42:12.037 --> 42:14.426
Witches! All right, everyone,
you know the drill!

42:14.597 --> 42:16.349
- Fiona!
- Witches! Oh, no!

42:16.517 --> 42:18.508
- Witches! Witches!
- Come on, now.

42:46.237 --> 42:48.910
Fiona, that's the third patrol today.
We can't hide forever.

42:49.077 --> 42:52.513
Trust me, Brogan.
After tonight, we won't have to.

42:54.037 --> 42:57.074
- That's your wife?
- That's my wife.

42:57.477 --> 43:00.389
Well, I see who wears the chain mail
in your family!

43:03.437 --> 43:08.227
Some people like to look
at the goblet as... as half empty.

43:08.397 --> 43:12.231
Me, I like to look at it as half full.

43:13.037 --> 43:16.029
We've gone from the bottom
to the top, ladies.

43:16.197 --> 43:19.189
But we're not just an empire.

43:19.717 --> 43:20.911
We're a family.

43:21.877 --> 43:25.426
Everyone has got their cupcake?
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?

43:25.597 --> 43:26.586
Good.

43:26.757 --> 43:29.829
Yeah, you know, we have
put away a lot of ogres.

43:29.997 --> 43:33.990
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.

43:34.477 --> 43:36.468
It doesn't matter to me.

43:36.637 --> 43:39.276
It's not like it's the end of the world.

43:40.397 --> 43:43.195
Except... funny thing.

43:43.357 --> 43:46.713
Now that I think about it,
the ogre who got away is Shrek!

43:46.877 --> 43:49.596
And if he shares a kiss
with Fiona by sunrise,

43:49.757 --> 43:52.794
it is the end of the world! Our world!

43:52.957 --> 43:54.754
My empire!

43:58.157 --> 44:00.512
But, as I was saying,

44:00.677 --> 44:04.556
I like to look at the goblet
as half full.

44:05.957 --> 44:07.868
Yelling makes me so parched.

44:08.037 --> 44:11.712
Would anyone care for some water?
Wet your whistle?

44:11.877 --> 44:14.630
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...

44:14.797 --> 44:17.834
<i>...of agua purificada?</i>

44:17.997 --> 44:20.227
Anybody's thirsty?
Nobody's thirsty? No?

44:21.197 --> 44:23.108
Well, then does anyone care to tell me

44:23.277 --> 44:25.791
what it's going to take
to get this ogre? You.

44:25.957 --> 44:27.026
Faster brooms?

44:27.197 --> 44:28.710
- No!
- Pointier hats?

44:28.877 --> 44:30.435
- No! You!
- Maybe we could hire

44:30.597 --> 44:32.235
a professional bounty hunter?

44:33.237 --> 44:36.070
What a world! What a world!

44:37.637 --> 44:40.435
You know, actually
not a bad idea. Baba!

44:41.037 --> 44:42.595
I need a bounty hunter.

44:42.757 --> 44:45.794
And if music doth
soothe the savage beast...

44:45.957 --> 44:49.029
...then I think I might know
just the person!

44:51.277 --> 44:55.350
Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.

44:55.517 --> 44:58.554
Stiltskin is leading
tonight's ogre hunt himself.

44:58.717 --> 45:00.355
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?

45:00.517 --> 45:02.269
I bet that's because of us.

45:02.437 --> 45:04.109
If that cupcake-eating clown

45:04.277 --> 45:07.269
finally leaves the safety
of his filthy witch nest...

45:07.917 --> 45:09.145
...he'll be vulnerable.

45:09.317 --> 45:12.354
The plan's simple.
If they follow the usual patrol route,

45:12.517 --> 45:14.553
they'll reach the river by midnight.

45:14.717 --> 45:18.073
We'll be concealed along this road,
waiting for his caravan.

45:18.237 --> 45:21.434
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.

45:21.597 --> 45:23.394
And then we attack!

45:28.917 --> 45:32.034
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?

45:32.197 --> 45:33.425
That's my chimichanga stand.

45:34.477 --> 45:36.547
No, Cookie. We won't be needing that.

45:36.717 --> 45:40.266
Trust me, Fiona. Y'all gonna be
really hungry after this ambush, OK?

45:41.157 --> 45:42.875
Go and finish your little speech.

45:43.597 --> 45:46.907
All right, as I was saying,
when the smoke clears,

45:47.077 --> 45:50.626
Rumpelstiltskin is gone
and the chimichangas have been eaten.

45:50.797 --> 45:53.311
Far Far Away will finally be free.

45:53.477 --> 45:55.149
- And so will we.
- Spread the word.

45:55.317 --> 45:58.434
We move out as soon as
Rumpel leaves the palace.

46:00.677 --> 46:02.793
- Man, this is serious!
- Tell me about it.

46:02.957 --> 46:05.425
How am I ever gonna
get her to kiss me before sunrise?

46:05.597 --> 46:07.076
Actually, I was talking
about the revolution.

46:07.237 --> 46:08.670
Revolution?

46:08.837 --> 46:10.668
Why don't you just
tell her what you told me?

46:10.837 --> 46:13.351
About how you're her true love and
you came from an alternate universe.

46:13.517 --> 46:15.235
Well, while I'm at it,
why don't I tell her

46:15.397 --> 46:17.308
that you're married
to a fire-breathing dragon

46:17.477 --> 46:20.389
and you have little, mutant
donkey-dragon babies.

46:20.877 --> 46:21.992
I do?!

46:22.157 --> 46:24.955
You saw what happened.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.

46:25.117 --> 46:26.266
I'm a daddy?

46:26.437 --> 46:29.668
You know what?
If I got Fiona to kiss me once...

46:31.597 --> 46:33.315
...then I can do it again.

46:34.157 --> 46:36.273
Shrek, do my babies
have hooves or talons?

46:36.437 --> 46:37.950
Donkey!

46:38.117 --> 46:39.470
Hello?

46:40.877 --> 46:41.992
Fiona?

46:47.757 --> 46:50.715
<i>You should not be here, senor.</i>

46:50.877 --> 46:52.196
Puss?

46:57.477 --> 46:59.115
You've gotta be kidding me.

47:00.116 --> 47:00.616
<u><b> <i>Rip made by ForsakeN</u></b></i>

47:12.397 --> 47:14.752
Feed me, if you dare.

47:14.917 --> 47:18.114
Puss, what happened to you?
You got so fa...

47:19.437 --> 47:22.315
...fancy.
- Do I know you?

47:22.477 --> 47:24.945
Well, where's your hat?
Where's your belt?

47:25.117 --> 47:26.789
Your wee little boots?

47:26.957 --> 47:29.312
Boots? For a cat? Ha!

47:29.477 --> 47:32.435
But you're Puss in Boots.

47:33.037 --> 47:34.550
Maybe once.

47:34.717 --> 47:36.196
But that is a name I have outgrown.

47:36.357 --> 47:37.949
That's not the only thing
you've outgrown.

47:38.117 --> 47:42.030
Hey! I may have let myself go
a little since retirement,

47:42.197 --> 47:44.665
but hanging up my sword
was the best decision of my life.

47:44.837 --> 47:47.749
I have all the cream I can drink
and all the mice I can chase.

47:49.317 --> 47:50.636
I'll get him later.

47:50.797 --> 47:53.106
Puss, what have I done to you?

47:53.277 --> 47:54.676
You've gone soft.

47:55.437 --> 47:59.430
Well, I do get brushed twice a day.

48:00.557 --> 48:02.115
Look, it's not too late to fix it.

48:02.277 --> 48:04.427
All you have to do is help me
get a kiss from Fiona.

48:04.597 --> 48:07.589
What are you doing?
Can I help you with something?

48:07.757 --> 48:10.590
Well, I know how stressful
mounting a rebellion can be...

48:10.757 --> 48:12.668
...rallying the troops,
planning attacks,

48:12.837 --> 48:16.466
so I brought you a little something
to ease the tension.

48:16.997 --> 48:18.032
A gift basket?

48:18.197 --> 48:20.711
You're welcome.
So let's see what you got.

48:20.877 --> 48:23.152
Heart-shaped box of slugs.

48:23.757 --> 48:26.112
Skunk-scented candle.

48:26.277 --> 48:30.475
- Look, this really isn't the...
- What's this? Coupons!

48:30.637 --> 48:32.593
Let's see,
"Good for one free foot massage."

48:32.757 --> 48:34.987
"A mud facial!"
Oh, and here's one...

48:35.157 --> 48:38.547
"Good for one free kiss."
Let's cash it now.

48:38.717 --> 48:40.628
Look, I don't know
what this is all about,

48:40.797 --> 48:42.276
but I'm trying to run a revolution.

48:42.437 --> 48:44.553
So unless you have
Rumpelstiltskin's head in there,

48:44.717 --> 48:46.753
I suggest you take your gift basket,

48:46.917 --> 48:50.466
get out of my tent
and go make yourself useful!

48:51.117 --> 48:55.235
Wow. You're right. I am sorry.

48:55.397 --> 48:58.309
I was just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?

48:59.877 --> 49:00.866
An apologetic hug?

49:02.037 --> 49:03.265
And a quick kiss goodbye.

49:04.717 --> 49:05.706
Hey!

49:06.277 --> 49:08.347
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?

49:09.997 --> 49:13.228
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do
they make people feel uncomfortable?

49:13.397 --> 49:16.389
- Where'd we find that guy?
- Could it be true?

49:16.557 --> 49:20.596
Have the years of prim
and pampery made me soft?

49:20.757 --> 49:23.555
Don't be silly.
Now who's a pretty kitty?

49:23.717 --> 49:25.196
I am.

49:32.717 --> 49:35.151
Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.

49:36.397 --> 49:37.386
Honk.

49:37.557 --> 49:39.070
All right, Piggies, be gone!

49:39.237 --> 49:41.353
Don't forget to take
her little potty box with you.

49:42.277 --> 49:44.154
This little piggy wants to go home!

49:44.317 --> 49:47.468
- Mr. Stiltskin! He's here.
- Nice.

50:00.677 --> 50:03.714
Pied Piper. How was your commute?

50:05.717 --> 50:06.752
Good.

50:06.917 --> 50:08.589
You call this guy a bounty hunter?

50:08.757 --> 50:11.510
What's he gonna do,
flute those ogres a lullaby?

50:22.997 --> 50:24.555
OK, got it!

50:25.717 --> 50:27.753
Make it stop!

50:31.877 --> 50:33.196
All right, that's enough.

50:36.397 --> 50:39.912
Looks like it's time to pay the piper.

50:41.997 --> 50:44.636
Griselda, seriously,
it's time to pay the piper.

50:44.797 --> 50:47.709
Now go get my cheque book!
Go! Move! Get out!

50:47.877 --> 50:49.788
Things are getting
real sloppy around here!

50:53.077 --> 50:54.829
Here, now make sure they eat up!

50:54.997 --> 50:58.148
You can't end tyranny on
an empty stomach! Go on! Go!

50:58.317 --> 50:59.750
Din-din!

51:07.197 --> 51:09.950
- Come on, Donkey.
- One more time, please?

51:10.117 --> 51:12.312
All right, but this is the last time.

51:13.797 --> 51:14.786
Here it comes. Look at him.

51:19.917 --> 51:21.669
I see you!

51:28.317 --> 51:30.114
That's quite a friend you've got there.

51:30.277 --> 51:32.313
I can see why you haven't eaten him.

51:32.477 --> 51:34.991
Donkey! I hate to pull you away
from your adoring public,

51:35.157 --> 51:37.352
but I'm not getting anywhere with Fiona.

51:37.517 --> 51:40.475
- I need your help!
- Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?

51:43.157 --> 51:45.113
- Where'd you get these?
- Fiona's garbage.

51:45.277 --> 51:48.075
Just another gift from some
clueless lover boy.

51:49.797 --> 51:51.389
That's a good one, Cookie!

51:52.357 --> 51:55.235
Anyone who knows Fiona knows
this stuff ain't gonna work on her.

51:55.397 --> 51:56.830
Works on me.

51:56.997 --> 51:59.750
Donkey, what am I gonna do?
It's like I don't even know her.

51:59.917 --> 52:03.148
You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing
Fiona cares about is her cause.

52:03.317 --> 52:06.195
- To the cause!
- To the cause!

52:08.277 --> 52:09.392
All right!

52:30.917 --> 52:31.906
Hello!

52:35.757 --> 52:37.748
- Nice moves.
- What are you doing?

52:37.917 --> 52:40.511
What does it look like?
I'm getting ready for ambush action.

52:40.677 --> 52:43.237
Oh, yeah.
I always like to quad my lutes

52:43.397 --> 52:47.390
and do some scrunches
before an operational... op.

52:47.557 --> 52:48.546
This one taken?

52:48.717 --> 52:50.469
We use that to clean the toilets.

52:52.317 --> 52:55.309
And we use that one to clean
the thing we clean the toilets with.

52:55.477 --> 52:56.705
I knew that.

52:57.757 --> 52:58.826
There you go, chief.

53:15.277 --> 53:17.347
Hey... Scott?

53:17.837 --> 53:19.589
My name is Shrek, actually.

53:19.757 --> 53:22.476
You're going to get yourself killed
at the ambush tonight.

53:22.637 --> 53:26.107
I'll be fine.
I think I can take care of myself...

53:26.597 --> 53:27.791
Well, let's see about that.

53:28.197 --> 53:30.552
Hey! Hey... Hey!

53:30.717 --> 53:31.706
What the?

53:36.237 --> 53:37.511
Fiona?

54:08.757 --> 54:09.985
I got it.

54:10.317 --> 54:11.591
Give me your hand.

54:13.837 --> 54:15.475
The dragon goes under the bridge,

54:15.637 --> 54:17.787
through the loop and finally...

54:17.957 --> 54:19.470
Into the castle.

54:27.757 --> 54:29.031
Wow.

54:30.677 --> 54:32.713
OK. Good.

54:33.317 --> 54:34.955
It seems like you can handle yourself.

54:35.117 --> 54:36.994
- But, Fiona...
- Go get ready for the mission!

54:37.157 --> 54:40.035
- I will, but Fiona...
- That's an order!

54:50.677 --> 54:53.953
All right, let's get those axes
sharpened and weapons packed!

54:54.117 --> 54:55.630
Preparation is half the battle!

54:56.757 --> 55:01.035
<i>Ogre! Un momento! Un momento!</i>

55:01.517 --> 55:03.951
<i>Ogre, ogre, un momento!</i>

55:05.517 --> 55:06.745
Just give me a minute.

55:06.917 --> 55:09.636
Look, Puss, I'm a little
pressed for time.

55:09.797 --> 55:12.834
I am not believing
what I have just witnessed.

55:12.997 --> 55:14.589
Back there, you and Fiona.

55:14.757 --> 55:17.317
There was a spark...
a spark inside her heart

55:17.477 --> 55:19.115
I thought was long extinguished.

55:19.277 --> 55:23.509
It was as if, for one moment,
Fiona had actually found her true love!

55:23.677 --> 55:26.874
I am her true love. I ended her curse.

55:27.437 --> 55:29.189
You know of her curse?

55:29.357 --> 55:32.508
By day, one way, by night another.

55:32.677 --> 55:35.316
<i>This shall be the norm.</i>

55:35.477 --> 55:38.833
<i>Until you find true love's first kiss...</i>

55:40.077 --> 55:43.786
<i>...and then take love's true form.</i>

55:44.637 --> 55:46.434
You even know the little rhyme!

55:46.597 --> 55:48.986
It is true! You are the one!
You must prove it to her!

55:49.157 --> 55:51.227
- How?
- Convince her!

55:51.397 --> 55:52.671
Go to her when she is alone

55:52.837 --> 55:56.352
and tell her something
that only her true love would know.

55:56.517 --> 55:57.996
Know about what?!

55:59.917 --> 56:02.511
Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty!
Shrek, can we keep him?

56:18.957 --> 56:20.709
Excuse me. Coming through!

56:20.877 --> 56:23.471
Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.

56:23.637 --> 56:26.390
Look, Donkey,
the chimichanga cart! Quick!

56:26.557 --> 56:29.310
<i>Ándale! After him, burro!
Donkey, vámonos!</i>

56:29.477 --> 56:31.513
Man, you are a cat-astrophe!

56:31.677 --> 56:33.952
And you are ri-donkey-lous!

56:39.597 --> 56:42.270
I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.

56:47.117 --> 56:48.914
Secure your positions!

57:04.597 --> 57:07.031
- It's quite a view from up here.
- What are you doing?!

57:07.197 --> 57:08.186
Get back in position!

57:08.357 --> 57:11.315
You need to know,
once and for all, who I really am.

57:11.477 --> 57:12.876
You are going to ruin everything!

57:13.037 --> 57:15.187
Ruin everything?
Actually, I'm gonna fix everything...

57:15.357 --> 57:17.951
The ogres, Rumpel, your curse.

57:19.477 --> 57:21.069
How do you know about my curse?!

57:21.237 --> 57:25.469
OK, OK, please, Fiona...
Just hear me out.

57:25.637 --> 57:28.071
I can explain everything.

57:31.437 --> 57:34.110
- Where's Fiona's signal?
- What's she waiting for?

57:34.277 --> 57:36.996
- He's going to get away!
- No, he's not.

58:01.517 --> 58:05.146
Listen, I don't know who you are
or how you know about my curse,

58:05.317 --> 58:07.114
but if any of these ogres
find out I'm...

58:07.277 --> 58:10.394
- A beautiful princess?
- That is not who I am! Not anymore.

58:10.557 --> 58:13.469
- Look, I know you're upset.
- You don't know anything about me.

58:13.637 --> 58:15.229
I know everything about you.

58:15.397 --> 58:18.275
I know you sing so beautifully
that birds explode.

58:18.437 --> 58:20.507
- Big deal.
- I know that when you sign your name,

58:20.677 --> 58:23.237
- you put a heart over the "l".
- So what?

58:23.397 --> 58:25.308
I know that when
you see a shooting star,

58:25.477 --> 58:27.388
you cross your fingers on both hands,

58:27.557 --> 58:31.186
squinch up your nose
and you make a wish.

58:31.357 --> 58:34.110
I know that you don't like the covers
wrapped around your feet,

58:34.277 --> 58:35.869
and I know that you sleep by candlelight

58:36.037 --> 58:37.948
because every time
you close your eyes...

58:38.957 --> 58:41.835
...you're afraid you're gonna
wake up back in that tower.

58:43.477 --> 58:45.513
But, most importantly, Fiona...

58:46.477 --> 58:49.913
...I know that the reason
you turn human every day...

58:52.117 --> 58:54.108
...is because you've
never been kissed...

58:55.477 --> 58:56.546
...well...

58:58.957 --> 59:00.072
...by me.

59:09.237 --> 59:12.991
- You move fast.
- It's not me doing the moving.

59:14.917 --> 59:16.987
- Why is this happening?!
- Love?

59:17.157 --> 59:20.149
- No, I'm being forced to dance!
- By love!

59:20.317 --> 59:22.956
No, I can't stop myself!

59:23.117 --> 59:25.836
Please! Make it stop!

59:25.997 --> 59:28.067
I can't control myself!

59:31.757 --> 59:34.749
Yeah! Cookie's bringing
the heat out of the kitchen!

59:36.917 --> 59:39.272
Oh, no! It's the Piper!

59:41.357 --> 59:44.827
I can't believe I let this happen,
and it's all because of you!

59:44.997 --> 59:49.229
- If you'd just let me kiss you!
- What? You're insane!

01:00:03.557 --> 01:00:07.470
We must do something before
they fandango themselves into oblivion!

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:10.913
- What can we do?
- First, you must stop dancing!

01:00:11.077 --> 01:00:13.671
When somebody tooties that fluty,
I got to shake my booty!

01:00:13.837 --> 01:00:15.395
Then it's up to me!

01:00:23.597 --> 01:00:27.272
Hurry! We must get them
away from the music!

01:00:29.517 --> 01:00:32.475
Puss and Donkey to the rescue!
We saved the day!

01:00:57.117 --> 01:00:59.506
Donkey... Can I borrow your tongue?

01:00:59.677 --> 01:01:00.712
Say what?!

01:01:01.637 --> 01:01:02.911
No. Hell...

01:01:05.277 --> 01:01:08.189
I don't care how big your eyes get,
player, it's not going down.

01:01:13.717 --> 01:01:14.752
All right!

01:01:15.237 --> 01:01:16.226
Stop!

01:01:16.397 --> 01:01:18.752
- Where are you going?
- To save my friends.

01:01:18.917 --> 01:01:21.636
- How, by getting yourself killed?
- If that's what it takes.

01:01:21.797 --> 01:01:23.025
Puss, say something.

01:01:23.197 --> 01:01:24.994
- Puss?
- Let me explain.

01:01:25.157 --> 01:01:27.193
That's how you knew so much about me.

01:01:27.357 --> 01:01:30.315
- Fiona, wait! Kiss me.
- What?

01:01:30.477 --> 01:01:32.035
It's the only way to save your friends.

01:01:32.197 --> 01:01:33.186
Get out of my way.

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:36.349
You used to believe that a single kiss
could solve everything!

01:02:01.877 --> 01:02:05.916
I don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.

01:02:06.077 --> 01:02:08.591
True love's kiss
was supposed to fix everything!

01:02:08.757 --> 01:02:10.748
Yeah, you know,
that's what they told me, too.

01:02:10.917 --> 01:02:13.147
True love didn't get me
out of that tower.

01:02:13.317 --> 01:02:15.911
I did. I saved myself.

01:02:17.037 --> 01:02:20.347
Don't you get it?
It's all just a big fairy tale.

01:02:20.517 --> 01:02:22.826
Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!

01:02:22.997 --> 01:02:24.316
How would you know?

01:02:24.477 --> 01:02:27.071
Did you grow up locked away
in a dragon's keep?

01:02:27.237 --> 01:02:29.956
Did you live all alone
in a miserable tower?

01:02:30.117 --> 01:02:32.347
Did you cry yourself
to sleep every night,

01:02:32.517 --> 01:02:34.985
waiting for a true love
that never came?!

01:02:36.237 --> 01:02:39.673
But... But I'm your true love.

01:02:39.837 --> 01:02:43.113
Then where were you
when I needed you?

01:02:54.477 --> 01:02:56.866
Maybe you kissed her wrong?

01:02:57.477 --> 01:02:58.466
No.

01:02:58.997 --> 01:03:00.715
The kiss didn't work...

01:03:01.637 --> 01:03:03.867
...because Fiona doesn't love me.

01:03:10.157 --> 01:03:11.795
Don't despair, fellow ogres!

01:03:11.957 --> 01:03:16.030
They can put us in cages,
but they can't cage our honour!

01:03:17.357 --> 01:03:20.155
Shrek and Fiona are together?!

01:03:22.157 --> 01:03:25.274
Yeah, I've heard enough of
your toot-a-lee-toots! You blew it!

01:03:25.437 --> 01:03:27.029
Wolfie! My speech wig.

01:03:27.197 --> 01:03:31.270
Baba! Ready my makeup.
And Piper, pull my socks up.

01:03:33.637 --> 01:03:36.151
- Tight.
- Attention, citizens.

01:03:36.917 --> 01:03:41.035
Please stay tuned for a message
from our tyrannical dictator!

01:03:42.357 --> 01:03:45.633
Hello, people.
It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...

01:03:45.797 --> 01:03:47.788
...shepherd of your dreams.

01:03:49.557 --> 01:03:52.390
Recently, a certain somebody

01:03:52.557 --> 01:03:55.754
has jeopardised our joyous lives.

01:03:56.677 --> 01:04:01.432
And that somebody
is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!

01:04:01.597 --> 01:04:03.792
That is why I come to you,
dear citizens.

01:04:03.957 --> 01:04:06.346
For whomever brings me this ogre,

01:04:06.517 --> 01:04:10.351
shall receive the deal of a lifetime.

01:04:10.997 --> 01:04:12.350
Just think of it! Total and

01:04:12.517 --> 01:04:14.155
- complete happiness.
- Ya!

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:17.627
Dazzling, radiant fulfilment!
All your greatest wishes.

01:04:17.797 --> 01:04:19.708
- Yeah!
- Your wildest dreams.

01:04:19.877 --> 01:04:24.314
Anything you could ever want!
No strings attached!

01:04:24.597 --> 01:04:27.555
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.

01:04:27.717 --> 01:04:33.314
So light your torches, sharpen
your pitchforks and get your mob on!

01:04:33.797 --> 01:04:36.709
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

01:04:40.797 --> 01:04:42.753
Go back where you came from!

01:04:45.797 --> 01:04:47.355
It seems that we are safe.

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:50.190
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky
and torchy out there. Let's go.

01:04:50.357 --> 01:04:54.270
What's the point?
The kiss didn't work. It's over.

01:04:54.437 --> 01:04:57.315
Look, Shrek, I know things
might seem a little bleak right now,

01:04:57.477 --> 01:04:59.832
but things always work themselves
out in the end, you'll see.

01:04:59.997 --> 01:05:02.272
- I bet by this time tomorrow...
- Don't you understand?

01:05:02.437 --> 01:05:04.029
There is no tomorrow.

01:05:04.197 --> 01:05:07.985
There's no day after that, and there's
no day after that day after that!

01:05:08.157 --> 01:05:11.513
My life was perfect
and I'm never going to get it back!

01:05:11.677 --> 01:05:15.113
If your life was so perfect, why'd you
sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?

01:05:15.277 --> 01:05:18.508
Because I didn't know
what I had until it was gone! All right?

01:05:23.117 --> 01:05:24.869
I didn't know what I had.

01:05:27.357 --> 01:05:30.713
Surrender now! I'm taking you in!

01:05:31.277 --> 01:05:34.667
Don't try to fight it, ogre!
The reward is mine!

01:05:34.837 --> 01:05:35.826
Gingy?

01:05:36.597 --> 01:05:38.906
- You unhand me, green devil!
- What are you doing?

01:05:39.077 --> 01:05:40.305
Collecting my bounty!

01:05:40.477 --> 01:05:42.388
- Bounty?
- What are you talking about, cracker?

01:05:43.117 --> 01:05:45.472
Rumpelstiltskin promised
the deal of a lifetime

01:05:45.637 --> 01:05:48.515
- for whoever could bring you in.
- Deal of a lifetime?

01:05:48.677 --> 01:05:51.589
Where all your wishes come true.

01:05:53.197 --> 01:05:54.471
Wait a minute.

01:05:55.237 --> 01:05:57.831
- I can still fix this.
- How you gonna do that?

01:05:57.997 --> 01:06:02.115
You know what? I'm gonna give
Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants.

01:06:02.277 --> 01:06:04.507
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...

01:06:08.717 --> 01:06:10.628
Were you going to eat that?

01:06:12.557 --> 01:06:15.515
Not Shrek. That is not Shrek.
Also not Shrek.

01:06:15.677 --> 01:06:18.828
That's not even an ogre,
it is a troll! Nice try.

01:06:18.997 --> 01:06:19.986
- And that...
- Roar.

01:06:20.157 --> 01:06:21.146
...is just sad.

01:06:21.957 --> 01:06:23.754
And what is that supposed to be?

01:06:23.917 --> 01:06:25.430
I'm just a frightened old man.

01:06:25.597 --> 01:06:28.395
Don't listen to him!
These ogres are crafty!

01:06:28.557 --> 01:06:30.115
That is your father painted green.

01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:32.233
No, it's Shrek! Honest!

01:06:33.717 --> 01:06:34.706
Take them away!

01:06:34.877 --> 01:06:37.630
Can no one bring me Shrek?!
Where is he?

01:06:37.797 --> 01:06:40.391
How hard can it be?!
I want him! I want him! I want him!

01:06:40.877 --> 01:06:42.151
Stiltskin!

01:06:43.677 --> 01:06:45.315
I hear you're looking for me.

01:06:46.117 --> 01:06:47.994
All right! Finally!

01:06:48.157 --> 01:06:51.467
Who turned him in?
Who gets the deal of a lifetime?

01:06:51.637 --> 01:06:53.389
- I do.
- What? But...

01:06:53.557 --> 01:06:57.311
If I'm turning myself in,
I get the deal of a lifetime.

01:07:00.197 --> 01:07:03.792
That means you have
to give me anything I want.

01:07:03.957 --> 01:07:06.425
No! Only true love's kiss
can break your contract!

01:07:06.597 --> 01:07:08.394
So if you thought you were just gonna...

01:07:09.397 --> 01:07:13.470
...in here and get your life back...
- I'm not here to get my life back.

01:07:13.997 --> 01:07:16.306
Then what do you want?

01:07:26.637 --> 01:07:29.026
The ogres. They are all free.

01:07:29.197 --> 01:07:30.630
But where is Shrek?

01:07:35.597 --> 01:07:37.827
This is not good.

01:07:38.917 --> 01:07:42.273
I don't know.
Not much of a storybook ending.

01:07:42.437 --> 01:07:48.034
The noble Shrek turns himself in
to save a bunch of filthy ogres.

01:07:48.557 --> 01:07:51.117
All that matters is that they're free...

01:07:51.597 --> 01:07:53.508
...and Fiona is safe.

01:07:54.957 --> 01:07:57.790
I bet Fiona would be
really touched to hear that.

01:07:58.437 --> 01:07:59.665
But, hey...

01:07:59.837 --> 01:08:02.635
...I guess you can tell her yourself.

01:08:03.437 --> 01:08:04.836
Fiona!

01:08:12.877 --> 01:08:16.995
Stiltskin, we had a deal!
You agreed to free all ogres!

01:08:17.157 --> 01:08:18.350
Oh, yeah.

01:08:18.517 --> 01:08:22.953
But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?

01:08:25.837 --> 01:08:31.389
By day, one way, by night, another.
Blardy, blardy, blar.

01:08:33.197 --> 01:08:35.313
Nobody's smart but me!

01:08:43.117 --> 01:08:45.506
That was a really brave thing
you did, Shrek.

01:08:46.237 --> 01:08:47.225
Thank you.

01:08:47.917 --> 01:08:50.147
No, you were right.

01:08:50.957 --> 01:08:52.993
I wasn't there for you.

01:08:53.157 --> 01:08:55.386
And not just at
the Dragon's Keep, but...

01:08:56.676 --> 01:08:58.349
...every day since.

01:08:59.277 --> 01:09:00.392
Well...

01:09:01.357 --> 01:09:02.915
...you're here now.

01:09:05.517 --> 01:09:07.234
Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!

01:09:07.397 --> 01:09:08.716
Don't be a fool, mule!

01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:11.265
She's right. Rumpel's palace
is locked up tighter

01:09:11.437 --> 01:09:14.587
- than Old Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.
- And that cupboard wasn't guarded

01:09:14.756 --> 01:09:17.635
by a whole bunch of
mean, ugly, nasty witches.

01:09:17.796 --> 01:09:20.550
Hey! We can hear you!

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:22.790
Sorry!

01:09:24.197 --> 01:09:25.948
We must get into the palace.

01:09:26.117 --> 01:09:28.153
Man, Shrek and me
just busted out of that place!

01:09:28.317 --> 01:09:29.796
But how?

01:09:30.957 --> 01:09:33.790
The same way we're gonna bust in.

01:09:38.077 --> 01:09:42.036
Yay! My new pretty ball!
Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue?

01:09:42.197 --> 01:09:43.710
I guess it'll have to do.

01:09:48.957 --> 01:09:53.473
Witches, finally, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

01:09:53.636 --> 01:09:56.310
The main event of the evening!

01:09:56.477 --> 01:09:59.514
I present Shrek and Fiona!

01:10:04.397 --> 01:10:08.276
And now, to put the past
behind us once and for all,

01:10:08.437 --> 01:10:12.032
I give you a princess's worst nightmare!

01:10:12.197 --> 01:10:15.633
Fiona's old flame,
the keeper of the keep...

01:10:15.797 --> 01:10:17.310
...Dragon!

01:10:39.357 --> 01:10:41.552
- Donkey?
- And Puss!

01:10:45.197 --> 01:10:46.266
In Boots!

01:11:15.157 --> 01:11:17.113
Get them, get them, witches!

01:11:18.877 --> 01:11:20.356
Incoming!

01:11:24.397 --> 01:11:26.672
- Donkey, woo her!
- Woo who?

01:11:26.837 --> 01:11:28.156
Your wife!

01:11:51.237 --> 01:11:52.306
Uh-oh.

01:11:57.597 --> 01:12:00.748
I'll call you! We're in love!

01:12:12.037 --> 01:12:13.436
Fiona, hold on!

01:12:15.077 --> 01:12:16.635
Hey, you!

01:12:44.957 --> 01:12:47.915
- Chimichangas?!
- Get 'em while they're hot!

01:12:54.557 --> 01:12:55.706
Jump!

01:12:59.037 --> 01:13:00.186
Now!

01:13:13.677 --> 01:13:16.191
The dragon goes under the bridge!

01:13:17.277 --> 01:13:18.710
Through the loop!

01:13:18.877 --> 01:13:19.912
And finally...

01:13:20.077 --> 01:13:21.590
Into the castle!

01:13:27.997 --> 01:13:29.316
Run!

01:13:35.197 --> 01:13:36.471
Foo!

01:13:38.237 --> 01:13:39.511
So long!

01:13:42.277 --> 01:13:43.346
Come on, Fifi, go!

01:13:43.517 --> 01:13:45.314
Go! Witches, close up the floor!

01:13:46.397 --> 01:13:48.911
Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap!

01:13:49.077 --> 01:13:52.308
Come on, go! Fly away! Up, up! Go!

01:13:53.117 --> 01:13:54.391
Fifi, no!

01:13:58.957 --> 01:14:00.788
Victory is ours!

01:14:08.837 --> 01:14:11.715
Looks like we're having
curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

01:14:11.877 --> 01:14:14.345
Hey, we make a pretty good team.

01:14:14.517 --> 01:14:16.394
You have no idea.

01:14:23.997 --> 01:14:25.271
Shrek?

01:14:27.957 --> 01:14:30.710
His day is up. His day is!

01:14:31.277 --> 01:14:32.392
Shrek?

01:14:33.437 --> 01:14:35.029
It's all right.

01:14:38.437 --> 01:14:40.632
There has to be something I can do.

01:14:41.437 --> 01:14:44.907
You've already done
everything for me, Fiona.

01:14:45.077 --> 01:14:47.545
You gave me a home and a family.

01:14:47.717 --> 01:14:49.389
You have kids?

01:14:49.557 --> 01:14:51.468
We have kids.

01:14:51.637 --> 01:14:55.346
Fergus, Farkle
and a little girl named...

01:14:55.517 --> 01:14:56.791
...Felicia.
- Felicia.

01:14:57.637 --> 01:15:00.310
I always wanted to have
a daughter named Felicia.

01:15:00.837 --> 01:15:02.429
And someday...

01:15:04.037 --> 01:15:05.311
...you will.

01:15:15.557 --> 01:15:18.117
You know what the
best part of today was?

01:15:20.637 --> 01:15:24.630
I got the chance to fall in love
with you all over again.

01:15:57.157 --> 01:15:59.876
Fiona, the sunrise!

01:16:00.037 --> 01:16:02.232
You're still... an ogre!

01:16:04.637 --> 01:16:07.470
- True love's form.
- Impossible!

01:16:08.197 --> 01:16:09.789
The kiss worked.

01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:17.471
What?!

01:16:26.517 --> 01:16:27.870
Fifi!

01:16:29.597 --> 01:16:30.871
Puss!

01:16:33.117 --> 01:16:34.789
No, no, no!

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:37.915
No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait!

01:16:51.477 --> 01:16:52.876
I love you, Daddy!

01:16:53.037 --> 01:16:56.154
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

01:17:00.397 --> 01:17:03.469
Everybody, I have found another cake!

01:17:04.197 --> 01:17:06.392
Shrek? Are you OK?

01:17:12.637 --> 01:17:16.630
Fiona. I've never been better.

01:17:18.717 --> 01:17:20.309
Roar!

01:17:24.957 --> 01:17:27.187
Happy Birthday, Farkle.

01:17:27.357 --> 01:17:29.552
Fergus, my little man!

01:17:29.717 --> 01:17:31.912
And Felicia, sweetheart.

01:17:32.077 --> 01:17:34.227
I believe this is yours.

01:17:35.557 --> 01:17:37.149
Thank you, Daddy.

01:17:38.597 --> 01:17:40.986
Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about
giving my babies an encore!

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:43.193
<i>Please, senor, let us have it!</i>

01:17:54.037 --> 01:17:57.347
- I didn't know we could do that.
- That's my best friend!

01:17:58.557 --> 01:18:00.627
You know, I always thought

01:18:00.797 --> 01:18:03.072
that I rescued you
from the Dragon's Keep.

01:18:03.237 --> 01:18:04.556
You did.

01:18:04.717 --> 01:18:08.153
No. It was you that rescued me.

01:18:10.154 --> 01:18:30.154
<u><b> <i>Rip made by ForsakeN</u></b></i>

01:19:35.517 --> 01:19:36.791
Yummy!
