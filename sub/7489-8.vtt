WEBVTT

00:05.656 --> 00:07.834
Hey, Ally! Wanna hang out?

00:07.835 --> 00:11.194
I have to put these
harmonicas away.

00:11.195 --> 00:13.330
Are you done yet?

00:13.331 --> 00:15.332
Are you done yet?

00:15.333 --> 00:17.100
Are you done yet?

00:17.101 --> 00:18.952
- How about now?
- Dez!

00:18.953 --> 00:20.923
Why don't you hang with Austin?

00:20.924 --> 00:24.307
I can't. Ever since he started
dating Kira I barely see him.

00:24.308 --> 00:28.958
I know you miss him, but part of growing
up is learning to be your own best friend.

00:28.959 --> 00:31.448
You're right. I
don't need Austin.

00:31.449 --> 00:33.610
I have myself and that's enough.

00:33.611 --> 00:34.833
Good. Now I'm going back...

00:34.834 --> 00:39.034
Don't leave me!
Myself's not enough!

00:39.048 --> 00:43.360
Guess who got a job at
Champy's Sports Grill?

00:43.361 --> 00:45.095
What's with Dez?

00:45.096 --> 00:47.431
He misses Austin.

00:47.432 --> 00:49.266
Oh, Dez.

00:49.267 --> 00:51.698
I'll hang out with you
till Austin gets back.

00:51.699 --> 00:53.913
- Thanks, Trish.
- Hey, Austin.

00:53.914 --> 00:58.508
Austin, I'm so glad you're here. I
almost had to hang out with Dez.

00:58.509 --> 01:00.985
How was Phil's Fun Town?

01:00.986 --> 01:04.247
Aw, you won Kira a giant panda.

01:04.248 --> 01:07.385
Actually, I won it for Austin.

01:07.386 --> 01:09.463
You weren't supposed
to tell anybody.

01:09.464 --> 01:13.156
Aw, you're so cute
when you pout.

01:13.157 --> 01:17.427
Aw, you're so cute when
you tell me I'm so cute.

01:17.428 --> 01:19.062
I should go. Walk me out?

01:19.063 --> 01:20.297
My pleasure.

01:20.298 --> 01:21.298
Um...

01:21.299 --> 01:23.939
I meant Austin!

01:24.564 --> 01:27.780
I know it's gotta be hard watching
Austin and Kira together.

01:27.781 --> 01:30.924
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Why wouldn't I be okay?

01:30.925 --> 01:32.822
Because last week you
said you liked Austin

01:32.823 --> 01:34.770
and now you're acting
like you're over him.

01:34.771 --> 01:36.525
Come on, Ally, you
can talk to me.

01:36.526 --> 01:41.084
There's nothing to talk about. Austin
likes Kira, and I'm totally cool with it.

01:41.085 --> 01:43.748
Totally cool with what?

01:43.749 --> 01:48.225
She's totally cool with
giving me 20 bucks.

01:48.226 --> 01:51.128
Pay up, so he'll believe it.

01:51.129 --> 01:54.297
She means I'm totally cool
that we can't hang out today

01:54.298 --> 01:56.684
because I have an old
friend coming into town.

01:56.685 --> 01:58.201
His name's Elliot.

01:58.202 --> 02:02.702
We went to Arts and
Crafts Camp together.

02:03.367 --> 02:06.041
Beep beep beep. Oh, just
got a text message.

02:06.042 --> 02:09.044
It says "nerd alert".

02:09.045 --> 02:10.622
I remember Elliot.

02:10.622 --> 02:12.763
He was your first crush.

02:12.764 --> 02:16.725
Here's a picture of us making
macaroni Christmas ornaments.

02:16.726 --> 02:21.646
Eh, if you take away the braces and bushy
eyebrows, he wouldn't look so bad.

02:21.647 --> 02:23.987
That's me.

02:24.295 --> 02:28.075
I am so excited to see Elliot.

02:29.849 --> 02:31.334
Ally?!

02:31.335 --> 02:33.375
Elliot!

02:36.474 --> 02:38.475
That's Ally's friend?

02:38.476 --> 02:39.941
Beep beep beep.

02:39.942 --> 02:42.702
<i>♪ "Hunk alert".</i>

02:47.887 --> 02:50.989

03:40.466 --> 03:44.362
It's so good to see you.
Wow, you look ah-mazing.

03:44.363 --> 03:48.466
Me? What about you?
You look gah-orgeous.

03:48.467 --> 03:51.536
Why are they talking
so cruh-azy?

03:51.537 --> 03:55.041
Come meet my friends. This
is Trish, Dez and Austin.

03:55.042 --> 03:59.344
Nice to meet you guys. Austin, I'm
a huge fan, your album rocks.

03:59.345 --> 04:02.728
Thanks, man. I have the best
songwriter in the business.

04:02.729 --> 04:05.182
Yeah, she's the
best at everything.

04:05.183 --> 04:07.981
That's why we were basket weaving
buddies at Camp Craft-a-Monga.

04:07.982 --> 04:11.779
And I'll never forget the first day
she walked into the weavers' tent.

04:11.780 --> 04:16.220
He said my baskets
were "unbe-weaveable".

04:17.596 --> 04:19.771
I used to do arts
and crafts too.

04:19.772 --> 04:22.232
Nobody cares.

04:23.201 --> 04:25.370
Remember when we
tie-dyed pillowcases?

04:25.371 --> 04:27.769
We were only supposed
to tie-dye T-shirts.

04:27.770 --> 04:30.207
We were arts and crafts rebels!

04:30.208 --> 04:33.933
Yeah... I don't think
those words go together.

04:33.934 --> 04:36.959
Check it out! It's
a hand turkey.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.517
Gobble gobble gobble.

04:39.518 --> 04:43.837
Put it away. You're
embarrassing yourself.

04:43.838 --> 04:47.858
Ally, I need to ask
you something.

04:48.326 --> 04:50.495
Will you...

04:50.496 --> 04:54.396
Help me make a toothpick
house for my turtle?

04:54.397 --> 04:57.764
Of course! Still
have your glue gun?

04:57.765 --> 05:01.485
I never leave home without it.

05:04.443 --> 05:06.648
Isn't he cute?

05:06.649 --> 05:11.509
I thought so until he
pulled out a glue gun.

05:12.451 --> 05:15.453
Well, great to meet you, Elliot.
Ally and I have to rehearse now.

05:15.454 --> 05:19.453
We'll rehearse later, Austin. I
wanna show Elliot around Miami.

05:19.454 --> 05:22.046
I saw a craft store in the Mall.
Can we hit that first?

05:22.047 --> 05:26.607
Does balsa wood make
the best bird feeder?

05:27.198 --> 05:29.358
It does.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:39.377 --> 05:41.710
Hey, Trish. Have you seen Ally?

05:41.711 --> 05:43.639
No. She's out with Elliot.

05:43.640 --> 05:47.629
Again? It's been three days. How long
does it take to catch up with a guy?

05:47.630 --> 05:50.421
A regular-looking guy, a day.

05:50.422 --> 05:54.191
A cutie like him? You may
never see Ally again.

05:54.192 --> 05:55.776
We need to write some new songs.

05:55.777 --> 05:58.744
But with Elliot around, it's
like Ally's too busy for me.

05:58.745 --> 06:01.587
Huh, join the club.

06:01.588 --> 06:03.656
You sure this is
just about work?

06:03.657 --> 06:05.591
You almost sound jealous.

06:05.592 --> 06:09.494
Why would I be jealous? I'm dating Kira.
She won me a panda.

06:09.495 --> 06:12.014
I was just asking. You don't
have to sound all defensive.

06:12.015 --> 06:16.100
I'm not defensive! I think
you're jealous of my panda.

06:16.101 --> 06:20.408
And then I said your baskets
were "unbe-weaveable".

06:20.409 --> 06:22.328
We had so much fun back then.

06:22.329 --> 06:28.229
Well, I bet your fun back then wasn't
anymore fun than our fun back now.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.014
Anyway...

06:30.015 --> 06:32.705
Ally, you ready for
our girls' day?

06:32.706 --> 06:35.106
Oh, Trish...

06:35.466 --> 06:39.056
Don't hate me, but I was really hoping
Ally and I could basket weave again...

06:39.057 --> 06:41.824
For old time's sake.
You wanna join?

06:41.825 --> 06:44.852
Oh, that sounds awful.

06:44.853 --> 06:47.770
Sorry, Trish. We'll have our
girls' day next weekend.

06:47.771 --> 06:50.471
Come on, Elliot.

06:51.303 --> 06:53.070
Hey, Austin. Ready
to go to the movies?

06:53.071 --> 06:54.406
Um...

06:54.407 --> 06:56.040
Can I take a rain check?

06:56.041 --> 06:59.277
I have to go work on
a song by myself.

06:59.278 --> 07:01.722
Ally hasn't had time since
Elliot's been in town.

07:01.723 --> 07:04.839
Is that the guy I just saw her with?
He's really cute.

07:04.840 --> 07:07.405
He carries a glue gun, you know?

07:07.406 --> 07:08.986
Well, I'm bummed
you can't make it.

07:08.987 --> 07:11.459
- Hey, Austin.
- Sorry. I'll call you later.

07:11.460 --> 07:14.460
- Okay?
- What time?

07:15.193 --> 07:16.994
That was really weird.
Is he okay?

07:16.995 --> 07:20.231
Yeah, I think he's just stressed because
he hasn't had time to write with Ally.

07:20.232 --> 07:23.717
Well, I guess that makes sense. But now
I've got no one to go to the movies with.

07:23.718 --> 07:25.069
I'll go with you!

07:25.070 --> 07:29.583
Aw, that's sweet, Dez. But you don't have
to do that for me. See you guys later.

07:29.584 --> 07:32.416
It wasn't for you.

07:32.417 --> 07:35.547
- Wanna hang?
- I don't know. I'm doing girly stuff...

07:35.548 --> 07:39.508
- I'll pay.
- To the spa we go.

07:46.511 --> 07:51.315
Guess who just got his eyebrows plucked,
armpits waxed and feet scraped?

07:51.316 --> 07:53.989
- That sounds painful.
- It was!

07:53.990 --> 07:57.287
And it's all your fault!

07:57.288 --> 08:00.257
Sorry, but... you do
smell pretty good.

08:00.258 --> 08:03.326
Thanks. It's cucumber melon.

08:03.327 --> 08:05.486
Why are you making
a bird's nest?

08:05.487 --> 08:07.064
It's a basket.

08:07.065 --> 08:09.907
Elliot's not the only guy
who can do arts and crafts.

08:09.908 --> 08:12.728
Apparently, he is.

08:13.737 --> 08:16.639
And I know why
you're doing this.

08:16.640 --> 08:18.540
You're bummed about
Ally and Elliot.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.676
A guy can't just basket
weave for the fun of it?

08:20.677 --> 08:23.557
No. No, he can't.

08:23.771 --> 08:26.535
Austin, don't you see
what's going on here?

08:26.536 --> 08:30.016
- You like Ally.
- What?! That's crazy!

08:30.017 --> 08:33.019
Is it? You don't like
anything about Ally?

08:33.020 --> 08:36.089
Well, yeah. I like a lot
of stuff about Ally.

08:36.090 --> 08:38.674
- I like writing songs with her.
- Uh huh.

08:38.676 --> 08:40.958
I like that I can talk
to her about anything.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.000
Go on.

08:44.022 --> 08:49.062
And... I like her smile
and the way she laughs.

08:49.163 --> 08:51.435
Oh! And I really like
when we're playing piano,

08:51.436 --> 08:54.222
and my hand accidentally
touches hers.

08:54.223 --> 09:00.123
I get this awesome feeling that no
one, not even Kira, makes me...

09:00.872 --> 09:02.580
Oh, man.

09:02.581 --> 09:04.531
I like Ally.

09:04.532 --> 09:07.417
Oh, it's more than that, buddy.

09:07.418 --> 09:11.378
I think you're in love with her.

09:11.505 --> 09:14.325
Wow. I like Ally.

09:29.989 --> 09:31.849
Yay.

09:31.896 --> 09:33.876
Score.

09:35.227 --> 09:39.190
I need to talk to you, Dez. I was up all
night thinking about what you said.

09:39.191 --> 09:42.851
About you and Ally and the...

09:42.936 --> 09:45.336
Yeah, the...

09:47.040 --> 09:48.941
Maybe I do have
feelings for her.

09:48.942 --> 09:52.945
But she clearly likes Elliot, and I'm
dating Kira, who I really really like.

09:52.946 --> 09:55.038
I get it. You're torn.

09:55.039 --> 09:58.266
Let me give you some
unbiased advice.

09:58.267 --> 10:00.650
Forget about girls! Hang
out with your best friend!

10:00.651 --> 10:04.311
Trust me. You'll feel better.

10:04.871 --> 10:07.767
Look, Dez, I like things the
way they are with Kira.

10:07.768 --> 10:09.658
And I don't wanna ruin
my friendship with Ally,

10:09.659 --> 10:11.286
just because I have
some mixed feelings.

10:11.287 --> 10:14.739
Your feelings aren't mixed. You like
Ally way more than you like Kira.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.982
No, I don't! And I'm
gonna prove it.

10:16.983 --> 10:20.503
Hey, Austin. I got your text. What's
so big you couldn't wait to tell me?

10:20.504 --> 10:22.638
That I'm sorry for how I've
been acting this week.

10:22.639 --> 10:25.150
I'm gonna make it up to
you starting tonight.

10:25.151 --> 10:27.219
We're seeing Katy Perry
at the beach club!

10:27.220 --> 10:28.804
Really?!

10:28.805 --> 10:32.405
Man! I wanna see Katy Perry.

10:33.194 --> 10:37.295
- Meet me at Sonic Boom at 7:00.
- Okay.

10:37.296 --> 10:39.198
Isn't she awesome?

10:39.199 --> 10:41.266
I can't believe I had
second thoughts.

10:41.267 --> 10:44.769
Obviously, me and Ally
should be together.

10:44.770 --> 10:49.241
- Did you hear what you just said?
- Later, buddy.

10:49.242 --> 10:52.006
Dez, since you have
no one to play table

10:52.007 --> 10:54.819
hockey with and I hate
working, I had an idea.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.216
- You wanna play table hockey with me?!
- Close.

10:57.217 --> 10:59.551
I want you to clean
the counter with me.

10:59.552 --> 11:02.072
Let's do it!

11:11.289 --> 11:14.529
And remember when we
tie-dyed pillowcases?

11:14.530 --> 11:17.650
Yep, I still remember.

11:18.138 --> 11:22.799
So, I'll meet you at Champy's at 7:00.
Don't forget, it's trivia night.

11:22.800 --> 11:26.078
Remember how competitive I was when
we used to play games at camp?

11:26.079 --> 11:30.219
Yes! I remember
everything from camp.

11:32.828 --> 11:34.911
Trish, I thought you were
supposed to be at work.

11:34.912 --> 11:38.024
I am. That's why I'm here.

11:38.025 --> 11:40.600
Great, because I
need to talk to you.

11:40.601 --> 11:43.699
Elliot mentioned the
"G" word today.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.714
Glue gun?

11:45.715 --> 11:47.394
No. Girlfriend.

11:47.395 --> 11:50.202
As in, I think he
wants me to be his.

11:50.203 --> 11:54.239
Ally, that's great! That's
what you wanted, right?

11:54.240 --> 11:57.152
I thought so, but after hanging
out with him for a week,

11:57.153 --> 12:00.006
I realize we have nothing
to talk about but camp.

12:00.007 --> 12:02.865
And that's all he talks about.

12:02.866 --> 12:06.440
That's too bad. I know
he was your first crush.

12:06.441 --> 12:09.958
Well, I'm not the same girl I
was at Camp Craft-a-Monga.

12:09.959 --> 12:14.732
No kidding. Your eyebrows
are nowhere near as bushy.

12:14.733 --> 12:17.618
I wanted so bad for things
to work out with him.

12:17.619 --> 12:19.261
I'm not even sure why.

12:19.262 --> 12:22.951
I know why. You
still like Austin.

12:22.952 --> 12:25.305
I know. You're right.

12:25.306 --> 12:29.551
Maybe I thought it would be easier to
get over Austin if I had somebody else.

12:29.552 --> 12:31.901
You have to tell Elliot
you're not interested.

12:31.902 --> 12:33.786
Okay, I'll do it tonight.

12:33.787 --> 12:38.304
I'll just say, "Elliot,
you were my first crush".

12:38.305 --> 12:42.625
I always wanted to
be your girlfriend".

12:44.192 --> 12:46.609
Oh. Hey, Dez.

12:46.610 --> 12:50.570
Hi, Ally. I didn't
hear anything.

12:51.164 --> 12:52.264
Okay.

12:52.265 --> 12:56.048
Um... well, I better get
ready to meet Elliot.

12:56.049 --> 12:58.293
What do I wear for
something like this?

12:58.294 --> 13:01.622
Well, you're coming to Champy's
and I'll be your server,

13:01.623 --> 13:04.507
so you should wear something
to hide food stains.

13:04.508 --> 13:06.144
I'll go with a red dress.

13:06.145 --> 13:07.648
I gotta find Austin!

13:07.649 --> 13:09.792
Make it quick. I wanna
hang out with you tonight.

13:09.793 --> 13:11.742
Really?! You wanna
hang out again?

13:11.743 --> 13:16.054
Well, you can keep doing all my work,
and I'll keep taking all the tips.

13:16.055 --> 13:19.720
But you can still call
it "hanging out".

13:19.721 --> 13:21.641
Deal!

13:24.745 --> 13:26.464
- Austin!
- Ah!

13:26.465 --> 13:28.684
We gotta talk about Ally.

13:28.685 --> 13:32.729
We already went over that.
I'm happy with Kira.

13:32.730 --> 13:36.319
Ally and I are just friends.
I swear.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.620
Okay, great, because I was
worried you'd be upset,

13:38.621 --> 13:41.361
that Ally's gonna tell Elliot
she wants to be his girlfriend.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.802
- What?!
- Yeah.

13:42.803 --> 13:46.275
She said he was her first crush and she's
always wanted to be his girlfriend.

13:46.276 --> 13:50.990
She's telling him tonight at Champy's.
She's wearing a red dress and everything!

13:50.991 --> 13:55.093
No! That can't happen. She can't be his
girlfriend, he's not the right guy for her.

13:55.094 --> 13:57.915
Well, I'm just glad you don't
have any feelings for Ally,

13:57.916 --> 14:03.816
because I'd hate to see how'd you
react if you really liked her!

14:09.656 --> 14:12.625
Hey, Austin. Ready for
the Katy Perry concert?

14:12.626 --> 14:15.703
Yeah, I just gotta drop something
off to Ally on the way.

14:15.704 --> 14:18.104
This pencil.

14:18.294 --> 14:22.231
It's her lucky one. She needs it to finish
lyrics for a song we're working on.

14:22.232 --> 14:24.233
Aren't all those
pencils the same?

14:24.234 --> 14:26.568
No, she's really superstitious.

14:26.569 --> 14:29.809
It has to be this one.

14:32.242 --> 14:35.842
I mean, this one! Let's go.

14:42.968 --> 14:48.188
And then I said your baskets
were "unbe-weaveable".

14:48.458 --> 14:51.014
I never get tired of
telling that story.

14:51.015 --> 14:53.715
Yeah, I noticed.

14:54.497 --> 14:56.271
Listen, Elliot. I
need to talk to you.

14:56.272 --> 14:57.732
Ally!

14:57.733 --> 15:00.128
Austin? What are you doing here?

15:00.129 --> 15:03.011
I brought your lucky pencil.

15:03.012 --> 15:06.031
This isn't my lucky pencil.

15:06.032 --> 15:09.167
I can't believe she noticed.

15:09.168 --> 15:11.090
Are you guys staying
for trivia night?

15:11.091 --> 15:14.204
- No, we're on our way to see Katy Perry.
- Aw, Kira.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.372
I think they want us to stay.

15:16.373 --> 15:19.122
Actually, I was kinda hoping
for some time alone...

15:19.123 --> 15:23.942
Oh, if you insist. A couple
questions won't hurt.

15:23.943 --> 15:26.844
Ally and I are gonna win.
We're the best team.

15:26.845 --> 15:28.449
No, you're not.

15:28.450 --> 15:29.914
Because me and Kira are.

15:29.915 --> 15:32.306
Aw, you think we
make a good team?

15:32.307 --> 15:35.309
Yeah, but not tonight.
Let's not play teams.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.775
I say we go head-to-head.

15:37.776 --> 15:40.247
Unless Elliot's
scared I'll beat him.

15:40.248 --> 15:43.417
- Austin, what about Katy Perry?
- I'll beat her too.

15:43.418 --> 15:44.980
So what do you say, Elliot?

15:44.981 --> 15:49.140
I say the same thing Camp
Craft-a-Monga says about sun block.

15:49.141 --> 15:51.361
Bring it.

15:53.428 --> 15:55.811
- What'd I miss?
- Dez, you're just in time.

15:55.812 --> 15:59.157
- I'm about to beat Elliot in trivia.
- But you stink at trivia.

15:59.158 --> 16:01.201
Dez, could you be a
little more supportive?

16:01.202 --> 16:04.976
Sorry. But you stink at trivia!

16:04.977 --> 16:10.877
Okay, people with nothing better
to do, welcome to trivia night.

16:11.145 --> 16:12.546
Yippee.

16:12.547 --> 16:14.481
Right. First question.

16:14.482 --> 16:18.951
"Name the British singer who
sang "Rolling in the Deep".

16:18.952 --> 16:21.711
That's a tough one. I'm
not really into music.

16:21.712 --> 16:25.426
Ha! You hear that, Ally?
He's not into music.

16:25.427 --> 16:26.427
Time's up.

16:26.428 --> 16:30.148
The correct answer is... Adele.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.466
Austin: One; Elliot: Zero.

16:32.467 --> 16:36.007
Kira: Bored. Can we go now?

16:37.339 --> 16:39.306
Okay, next question.

16:39.307 --> 16:42.242
"Name the method for dyeing
of fabric using wax".

16:42.243 --> 16:45.548
- I know this from camp.
- Shocker.

16:45.549 --> 16:47.645
What is it, Kira?! Think think!

16:47.646 --> 16:51.289
- I have no idea.
- Hey! No helping each other.

16:51.290 --> 16:53.654
Time's up. The answer is...

16:53.655 --> 16:55.656
- Batiking.
- Yes!

16:55.657 --> 16:58.067
All tied up.

16:58.068 --> 16:59.914
In your face, Austin.

16:59.915 --> 17:01.428
You know whose face
we should be in?

17:01.429 --> 17:03.446
Katy Perry's.

17:03.447 --> 17:06.627
Just one more question.

17:06.886 --> 17:09.500
That was our 50th
and final question.

17:09.501 --> 17:10.705
Did I win?!

17:10.707 --> 17:13.272
Austin, you and
Elliot are tied...

17:13.273 --> 17:15.523
For last place.

17:15.525 --> 17:17.123
Oh, and Ally Dawson won.

17:17.124 --> 17:19.445
Woo! Free appetizer!

17:19.446 --> 17:21.415
Austin, let's go. I don't
wanna miss the concert.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.111
And, Elliot, I really
need to talk to you.

17:23.112 --> 17:27.371
No! No one can do anything
until I beat him.

17:27.372 --> 17:31.152
I know how we can settle this.

18:16.177 --> 18:19.347
Okay, this is ridiculous. You guys
have been doing this for hours.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.114
Why don't you guys
just call it a draw?

18:21.115 --> 18:23.183
No, we're not done!
I have to beat him!

18:23.184 --> 18:25.052
I don't understand why
you care so much.

18:25.053 --> 18:27.082
Yeah, Elliot. Why do you care?

18:27.083 --> 18:28.536
You know what?

18:28.537 --> 18:31.477
- I don't.
- Whoa!

18:34.582 --> 18:36.982
Yes! I won!

18:37.499 --> 18:38.886
You sure?

18:38.887 --> 18:44.137
Winners aren't usually covered
in egg salad and buffalo sauce.

18:44.138 --> 18:46.961
Elliot's not so perfect
now, is he, Ally?

18:46.962 --> 18:49.209
Still wanna be his girlfriend?

18:49.210 --> 18:52.964
- What? I don't...
- So that's why you cared so much!

18:52.965 --> 18:55.883
I should have known something
was going on, I'm out of here.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.634
Kira, wait! I can explain!

18:58.635 --> 19:02.589
Ally, is that true? You
wanted to be my girlfriend?

19:02.590 --> 19:04.651
Actually, I just wanna...

19:04.652 --> 19:08.457
No, I guess now is as good a
time as any to tell you, Ally.

19:08.458 --> 19:10.516
I just wanna be friends.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.437
What?

19:12.487 --> 19:14.257
Sorry, but...

19:14.258 --> 19:18.325
I just realized we have got
nothing to talk about but camp.

19:18.326 --> 19:20.527
It gets a little
boring after awhile.

19:20.528 --> 19:22.797
You think?

19:22.798 --> 19:25.091
Uh, I mean...

19:25.092 --> 19:28.498
Yeah. Maybe we just
weren't meant to be.

19:28.499 --> 19:33.899
We'll always have camp. We'll
always only have camp.

19:37.156 --> 19:41.032
Look, Austin. I know you like me, but you
obviously also have feelings for Ally.

19:41.033 --> 19:44.144
- No, I don't.
- Austin, come on!

19:44.145 --> 19:46.150
Okay, yes.

19:46.151 --> 19:48.290
No. Maybe.

19:48.291 --> 19:50.167
I don't know. I'm confused.

19:50.168 --> 19:56.068
Well, I'm not. When you figure out
what you want, give me a call.

19:56.531 --> 19:58.699
At least you don't have to
worry about Elliot anymore.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.434
Austin made that easy.

20:00.435 --> 20:02.569
Yeah, what was that all about?

20:02.570 --> 20:04.054
I don't know.

20:04.055 --> 20:07.808
If you ask me, he's been acting
weird since Elliot got here.

20:07.809 --> 20:10.674
It's like he's jealous.

20:10.675 --> 20:12.775
Jealous?

20:13.440 --> 20:15.649
- You don't think...
- Yup.

20:15.650 --> 20:17.484
Austin likes you.

20:17.485 --> 20:19.405
Whoa.

20:20.789 --> 20:22.623
What should I do?

20:22.624 --> 20:25.860
- Should I tell him I like him too?
- No, let him come to you.

20:25.861 --> 20:27.984
Guys hate to be pressured.

20:27.985 --> 20:29.696
They're like birds.

20:29.697 --> 20:34.617
If you freak them out,
then they'll fly away.

20:34.872 --> 20:39.192
Sorry, I've been
hanging out with Dez.

20:49.066 --> 20:51.586
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:52.231 --> 20:58.131
- Listen, Ally, about tonight...
- You don't have to say anything, Austin.

21:00.702 --> 21:05.210
I mean, you don't have
to not say anything.

21:05.211 --> 21:08.046
You know what? Let's
just work on the song.

21:08.047 --> 21:09.967
Okay.

21:27.066 --> 21:32.046
I was thinking the chorus
could go like this...

21:37.310 --> 21:40.490
Yeah, that'd be great.

21:53.292 --> 21:56.128
I really had fun hanging
out with you today, Dez.

21:56.129 --> 21:58.296
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:58.297 --> 22:00.232
You're a good friend.

22:00.233 --> 22:03.113
You missed a spot.

22:04.070 --> 22:09.274
Well, the Restaurant's all
clean, and here's your tips.

22:09.275 --> 22:12.366
Now will you play with me?

22:12.367 --> 22:14.527
Why not?

22:18.217 --> 22:20.017
Oh!

22:20.836 --> 22:22.696
Man!

22:24.123 --> 22:27.288
- But paper covers rock.
- Who cares?
