take that table and chairs.

16:29.402 --> 16:31.024
- We definitely
should get that checked out.

16:31.059 --> 16:32.957
- Maybe this locker
wasn't the best of the bunch.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.684
'Cause right now, it's feeling
just as crappy as the others.

16:41.759 --> 16:42.932
♪

16:42.967 --> 16:46.039
- Here we go, America.
Cowabungas.

16:46.074 --> 16:48.455
Bird!
- Hey, that's me.

16:48.490 --> 16:49.767
- Hey, Kenny.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.458
- Today, I'm meeting
a dude named Bird

16:51.493 --> 16:53.046
with my half a surfboard.

16:53.081 --> 16:55.324
Man, look at all these
surfboards in here, bruh.

16:55.359 --> 16:57.395
All of them been ridden on?
- Oh, yeah.

16:57.430 --> 16:59.294
All of them have got history,
that's for sure.

16:59.328 --> 17:00.985
- How many of them
got shark bites in them?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.607
- Uh, we don't mention
the "S" word here.

17:02.642 --> 17:03.988
- Oh, I'm sorry.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.335
- Wow, what you got here
is pretty interesting, though.

17:06.370 --> 17:07.992
Everybody knows
about surfboards,

17:08.027 --> 17:09.338
and they know
about boogie boards,

17:09.373 --> 17:11.547
but prior to boogie boards, um,

17:11.582 --> 17:12.893
there were these
types of boards,

17:12.928 --> 17:14.516
and they're called
belly boards.

17:14.550 --> 17:16.069
- Belly board.
- Yeah, belly board.

17:16.104 --> 17:17.795
Yeah, well, there you go, huh?
- Yeah.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.280
- So they're constructed
the same as surfboards are.

17:20.315 --> 17:22.524
They're built
out of foam on the inside,

17:22.558 --> 17:25.078
fiber glass,
cloth, and then resin.

17:25.113 --> 17:27.563
This is standard foam.
The center piece of foam

17:27.598 --> 17:30.808
running up the middle
is actually high density foam.

17:30.842 --> 17:34.053
And then on either side of that
are these runners of wood.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.468
That gives the board strength.

17:35.502 --> 17:37.677
This was made to ride
some pretty powerful waves.

17:37.711 --> 17:40.680
This is, uh, fins that are
put on here for stability.

17:40.714 --> 17:42.371
Most boards
would have just one fin.

17:42.406 --> 17:43.959
- Uh-huh.
- But better belly boards

17:43.993 --> 17:45.995
had dual fins.
They give you more bite.

17:46.030 --> 17:47.652
- Yeah, bite.

17:47.687 --> 17:49.861
When you're riding the wave,
it gives you bite

17:49.896 --> 17:51.691
into the face of the wave.

17:51.725 --> 17:53.002
- I thought you were
talking about

17:53.037 --> 17:54.211
a bite from something else.
- Nope, no bites

17:54.245 --> 17:55.557
from anything, man.
- All right.

17:55.591 --> 17:57.352
How much you think I could
get for it now, Bird?

17:57.386 --> 17:58.905
- It's in pretty
good condition overall.

17:58.939 --> 18:00.217
A lot of this, I can clean up.

18:00.251 --> 18:02.702
I can make it look
about 50% better.

18:02.736 --> 18:03.841
Then you start to add on

18:03.875 --> 18:05.808
the nice, high density
foam stringer.

18:05.843 --> 18:07.465
You've got twin fins on it,
and most boards

18:07.500 --> 18:09.812
had a single fin on it.
Uh...

18:09.847 --> 18:10.813
Hmm.

18:12.988 --> 18:15.370
That'd sell, I think,
for about 500 bucks.

18:15.404 --> 18:18.131
- Now Bird, that's the word.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.513
$500 for a half a surfboard?

18:20.547 --> 18:22.791
Maybe I need to learn
how to surf after all.

18:22.825 --> 18:24.275
"Commabungas."

18:24.310 --> 18:27.520
You know what, Bird, for 500,
you can put me in the water.

18:27.554 --> 18:29.211
- Deal.
- I think.

18:31.179 --> 18:32.835
- Go, take the chair.

18:32.870 --> 18:34.906
- Well, I guess I'll just...
- Closing the locker.

18:36.045 --> 18:37.323
Hi.
- Hi.

18:37.357 --> 18:38.669
- Well, good to see you.

18:38.703 --> 18:40.257
- Hello.

18:40.291 --> 18:42.155
- Today, we're sitting down
with Nick Metropolis

18:42.190 --> 18:43.881
to find out what our
dining room set is worth.

18:43.915 --> 18:47.298
So we've got this vintage-y
looking table and chairs.

18:47.333 --> 18:50.025
- Well, the chair's probably

18:50.059 --> 18:52.303
1953, 1957.

18:52.338 --> 18:54.167
- Uh, is the year, yet--
- I just thought

18:54.202 --> 18:56.135
they were knockoffs.
- They've been redone.

18:56.169 --> 18:59.759
Done very nicely, and an
expensive upholstery job.

18:59.793 --> 19:01.347
Because doing tufts
in this sewing is like--

19:01.381 --> 19:02.900
- Yeah.
- You got to know

19:02.934 --> 19:05.178
what you're doing to do that.
- Was that pretty commonplace,

19:05.213 --> 19:08.077
for people to take stuff from
the 50s and re

19:08.112 --> 19:10.183
- In those days, the chairs
would eventually get,

19:10.218 --> 19:12.047
you know, messed up.
The vinyl would tear.

19:12.081 --> 19:14.049
People would throw them away.
- Yeah.

19:14.083 --> 19:16.051
- So I get a lot of tables
that don't have chairs.

19:16.085 --> 19:17.846
- No chairs, so the chairs
are a little more sought after?

19:17.880 --> 19:19.468
- Very, very much, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

19:19.503 --> 19:21.884
Well, what about the table?
Would you say it's a set, or...

19:21.919 --> 19:24.542
- No, this would be,
uh, the 70s.

19:24.577 --> 19:26.717
This is definitely mid-50s.
- Okay.

19:26.751 --> 19:28.201
- And I think
it's a reproduction

19:28.236 --> 19:30.203
of a table
that's called Saarinen.

19:30.238 --> 19:32.274
The original would
would be worth, like,

19:32.309 --> 19:33.965
a few thousand.
Maybe 3,000.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.346
- Now, this one's

19:35.381 --> 19:38.142
a reproduction one,
but still, it's got some value.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.764
- What do you think we can get
for the whole set?

19:39.799 --> 19:42.215
- Well, a couple of your chairs
have a little imperfection.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.183
- They need a good cleaning.
- But this is good labor,

19:44.217 --> 19:47.358
so, um...

19:47.393 --> 19:49.533
You'd be able to get 250.

19:49.567 --> 19:50.706
- Yeah.
- Wow.

19:50.741 --> 19:52.052
Just throw it in?

19:52.087 --> 19:54.158
- Um, you know, no,
you can sell the table.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.815
The base is very valuable.

19:55.849 --> 19:57.920
Someone will give me 200
just for that base.

19:57.955 --> 20:00.199
- That's awesome.
- This is fun for a little, uh,

20:00.233 --> 20:02.201
breakfast nook,
or something like that.

20:02.235 --> 20:05.997
- Yeah, I'm more of a sit on
the couch and eat kind of guy.
