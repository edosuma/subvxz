03:54.013 --> 03:56.263
It's not trash, Danno.
I think it's a puzzle.

03:56.265 --> 03:58.548
Can you open it, please?

04:00.902 --> 04:02.886
Of course I can open it.

04:08.693 --> 04:10.027
All right, I got an idea.

04:10.029 --> 04:11.328
I'll make a call
later tonight.

04:11.330 --> 04:12.780
I'm gonna call Santa Claus
and ask him

04:12.782 --> 04:14.782

04:14.784 --> 04:17.567
I want to see what's inside
<i>that</i> one.

04:17.569 --> 04:19.420
Come on.
It could be, like,

04:19.422 --> 04:23.240
a gold coin, a treasure map,
a letter from someone

04:23.242 --> 04:24.875
stranded on a
desert island.

04:24.877 --> 04:27.511
Come on. Don't you want to know?

04:28.346 --> 04:30.431

04:38.756 --> 04:41.558
Yeah.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.945
Oh, let me guess.
I come pick you up, right?

Thanks.

05:09.337 --> 05:10.804
Guess it's
casual Friday.

05:10.806 --> 05:12.556

05:12.558 --> 05:14.508

05:16.896 --> 05:18.729
DANNY: Right.
Which I'd much rather

05:18.731 --> 05:20.564
be spending my
Christmas Eve over there

05:20.566 --> 05:21.765
than with a dead guy,
all right?

05:21.767 --> 05:23.567
So if we could speed
this up, that'd be nice.

05:23.569 --> 05:26.270
Well, in that case.
Male vic,

05:26.272 --> 05:28.772
GSW to the head,
most likely a nine-millimeter.

05:28.774 --> 05:32.159
Shooter did a pretty good job
of covering his tracks.

05:32.161 --> 05:34.144
There's no clothes, obviously.
No wallet, no I.D.

05:34.146 --> 05:36.663
Nothing on the vic except
the gift wrapping.

05:37.866 --> 05:39.082
Who found this guy?

05:39.084 --> 05:40.951
Fritz over there--
caught a whiff

05:40.953 --> 05:43.487
of our DB in the trunk
and alerted the owner.

05:43.489 --> 05:46.206
Well, I, uh, I don't speak dog.
Maybe you want

05:46.208 --> 05:48.158
to question him.
Hey, come here, buddy.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.460
Come on.
Right here.

05:49.462 --> 05:52.095
Come here. All right, good dog.
Look at this.

05:52.097 --> 05:53.630
You know something?
You're actually a lot

05:53.632 --> 05:54.965
funnier in short pants,
you know that?

05:54.967 --> 05:57.518
Is that right?
Yeah. What about this car?

05:57.520 --> 05:59.102
Owner said it came in
three days ago,

05:59.104 --> 06:01.338
but there wasn't body in it
when it was inventoried.

06:01.340 --> 06:02.940
Which means that someone must've
snuck in and

06:02.942 --> 06:04.691
dumped our vic inside.
Okay, and how'd

06:04.693 --> 06:06.109
the shooter get into this place?

06:06.111 --> 06:08.512
A lock was cut on the gate
around back. I got CSU

06:08.514 --> 06:10.514
checking it for prints
and tool marks right now.

06:10.516 --> 06:12.182
What happens to these cars
once they're crushed?

06:12.184 --> 06:14.184
Apparently, they get
sent over to China

06:14.186 --> 06:15.569
where they're
sold as scrap.

06:15.571 --> 06:16.904
Whoever did this was smart.

06:16.906 --> 06:18.688
I mean, if it wasn't
for Fritz here,

06:18.690 --> 06:19.990
this thing would've gone
according to plan,

06:19.992 --> 06:21.708
and we would never be
investigating this murder.

06:21.710 --> 06:22.859
Mm-hmm.

06:22.861 --> 06:24.027
There goes
our holiday.

06:24.029 --> 06:25.295
Hey, Fritz.

06:26.381 --> 06:28.415
Thanks a lot.

06:28.417 --> 06:30.551

CHIN: <i>Any luck locating Adam</i>
<i>in Seattle?</i>

06:51.847 --> 06:54.397
No, but I got a hit
off his mother's maiden name

06:54.399 --> 06:55.949
on some recent ATM transactions
in Canada.

06:55.951 --> 06:57.901
So I'm going up there
to run it down.

06:57.903 --> 06:58.902
You really think

06:58.904 --> 07:00.036
Adam could be there?

07:00.038 --> 07:02.205
I don't know, but I gotta
check it out.

07:02.207 --> 07:03.206

07:26.898 --> 07:28.297
You are just in time.

07:28.299 --> 07:31.150
Time for what?
A game of Operation?

07:31.152 --> 07:33.152
I would prefer
if you would refrain

07:33.154 --> 07:35.638
from making your mildly
entertaining witticisms

07:35.640 --> 07:38.358
as this takes complete
concentration.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.993
Yeah, no, I know
you don't want to make

07:39.995 --> 07:41.310

go off, right?

07:41.312 --> 07:42.478
I don't envy you, Commander.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.031
Uh, we get an I.D.
on the vic, Max?

07:45.033 --> 07:47.033
Well, I pulled
prints and DNA,

07:47.035 --> 07:48.334
and sent them
over to the lab.

07:48.336 --> 07:49.953
We are currently waiting
for the results.

07:49.955 --> 07:54.657
However, I do have an early
Christmas gift for both of you.

07:54.659 --> 07:57.176
Hmm.
I found something intriguing

07:57.178 --> 07:59.963
underneath one of
the victim's fingernails.

07:59.965 --> 08:03.550
It's latex,
most likely from a glove.

08:03.552 --> 08:05.668
We didn't find any gloves
at the scene, Max.

08:05.670 --> 08:07.837
It's possibly
a professional requirement.

08:07.839 --> 08:09.856
Maybe he was a surgeon
or a dentist.

08:09.858 --> 08:12.642
Or the noblest profession:
medical examiner.

08:12.644 --> 08:14.277
Maybe he was
using the gloves

08:14.279 --> 08:16.779
'cause he was gonna kill
a medical examiner.

08:16.781 --> 08:18.347
Ah, witticism.

08:18.349 --> 08:20.400
Ah!

08:20.402 --> 08:22.018
There you are, my little friend.

08:22.020 --> 08:24.854
No wonder you were such
a challenge to extract.

08:26.490 --> 08:27.874
See the way it's mushroomed
like that?

08:27.876 --> 08:29.959
It's a jacketed
hollow cavity.

08:29.961 --> 08:31.578
They're designed
for rapid expansion

08:31.580 --> 08:33.796
and maximizing tissue damage
and blood loss.

08:33.798 --> 08:35.698
Not to mention
massive disruption

08:35.700 --> 08:37.049
of ballistic evidence.

08:37.052 --> 08:38.868
Which means it's unloadable
into IBIS.

08:38.870 --> 08:39.969
Okay, our victim's

08:39.971 --> 08:41.554
been shot execution style,

08:41.556 --> 08:44.373
a well-planned body dump,
and now we got this

08:44.375 --> 08:46.709
highly lethal ammunition
that cannot be traced.

08:46.711 --> 08:49.712
I am saying that this is not
this guy's first barbecue.

08:49.714 --> 08:52.398
He's done this before.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.668
CHIN: <i>Fingerprints on our John Doe</i>
<i>came back.</i>

08:55.670 --> 08:56.719
He's not in the system.

08:56.721 --> 08:57.820
CATHERINE:
No, but we did have

08:57.822 --> 08:58.988
some luck
with his DNA.

08:58.990 --> 09:00.556
Hit came back to 12

09:00.558 --> 09:02.275
unsolved break-ins
here on Oahu.

09:02.277 --> 09:03.726
So, this guy's a burglar.

09:03.728 --> 09:05.161
That would explain the latex

09:05.163 --> 09:06.613
that Max found
under his fingernails.

09:06.615 --> 09:08.781
I mean, our victim could
have been wearing gloves

09:08.783 --> 09:11.017
because he was involved
in the commission of a crime.

09:11.019 --> 09:13.586
CATHERINE: Police reports indicated that
all the burglarized homes

09:13.588 --> 09:15.905
had a security system
and hidden safes.

09:15.907 --> 09:16.956
So the guy did his homework.

09:16.958 --> 09:19.092
Definitely a pro.
Take a look at this.

09:19.094 --> 09:21.210
He used low-tech items
like a glass cutter,

09:21.212 --> 09:23.763
tin foil and silicone
to bypass

09:23.765 --> 09:24.964
some very complex alarm systems.

09:24.966 --> 09:27.100
In fact, he was so good
at covering his tracks,

09:27.102 --> 09:28.751
that some of the victims
didn't even realize

09:28.753 --> 09:31.020
they'd been robbed until days
or weeks after they'd been hit.

09:31.022 --> 09:33.022
Maybe could be the burglar
surprised a homeowner,

09:33.024 --> 09:35.391
paid for it with his life.
If that was the case,

09:35.393 --> 09:36.643
why wouldn't he
call the cops

09:36.645 --> 09:38.427
after he shot the guy
and claim self-defense?

09:38.429 --> 09:39.696
Why would he dump the body?

09:39.698 --> 09:41.147
DANNY:
I agree with him.

09:41.149 --> 09:42.849
We know our shooter's
a pro, right?

09:42.851 --> 09:45.702
So, uh, maybe these guys
are in it together.

09:45.704 --> 09:48.270
They, uh... they get into
a dispute over some money.

09:48.272 --> 09:52.075
One guy kills the other guy,
uh, dumps him in the junkyard.

09:52.077 --> 09:53.576
What are friends for, right?

09:53.578 --> 09:54.744
Wow, someone's cynical.

09:54.746 --> 09:56.496
Yeah, well, that's what happens
when you take my

09:56.498 --> 09:57.964
day off away from me.
Let's I.D. this guy,

09:57.966 --> 10:00.466
put him in jail so I can get
back to my daughter, please.

10:00.468 --> 10:03.302
Recognize this guy?

10:03.304 --> 10:05.672
No. Who is he?

10:05.674 --> 10:07.807
He is a local burglar
who's been hitting

10:07.809 --> 10:09.392
high-end homes
all over the island

10:09.394 --> 10:10.727
for the last six months.

10:10.729 --> 10:12.729
Looks dead.

10:12.731 --> 10:14.480
He does look dead.
That's very observant.

10:14.482 --> 10:16.232
Um, do you know
his name?

10:16.234 --> 10:18.234
Sorry.

10:18.236 --> 10:20.319
Despite of what you may think,

10:20.321 --> 10:22.355
I don't know every undesirable
on the island.

10:22.357 --> 10:23.690
But don't you have

10:23.692 --> 10:25.992
a computer that does?
Yes, we do.

10:25.994 --> 10:28.310
Uh, we're just doing this
for redundancy.

10:29.646 --> 10:31.814
You just snarked yourself
out of a favor.

10:31.816 --> 10:33.499
No, please, listen, okay?
Just ignore this man

10:33.501 --> 10:35.251
and do this for me,
would you, please,

10:35.253 --> 10:36.669
Kamekona?
Come on.

10:38.922 --> 10:42.125
Well, there is this brutha
down in North Shore,

10:42.127 --> 10:43.760
owns a pawnshop.

10:43.762 --> 10:45.378
Specializes in hot merch.

10:45.380 --> 10:46.295
Okay, nice.

10:46.297 --> 10:47.830
Talk to him.
See what he knows.

10:47.832 --> 10:49.882
Okay? Please.
Shoots.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.015
What are you doing?

11:06.017 --> 11:07.867
Knitting a sweater.

11:07.869 --> 11:09.185
What does it look
like I'm doing?

11:09.187 --> 11:10.953
Where'd you get
that thing, anyway?

11:10.955 --> 11:12.855
Grace found it
on the beach.

11:14.191 --> 11:15.374
You know,
you've been

11:15.376 --> 11:17.243
playing with it
ever since you got in the car.

11:17.245 --> 11:18.377
It can't be that hard.

11:23.467 --> 11:25.551
Whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

11:25.553 --> 11:26.669
Don't cheat. Why you...
why you gotta cheat?

11:26.671 --> 11:28.137
Cheat?
Yeah, cheat.

11:28.139 --> 11:30.306
Show me the rules. Show me
where it says I can't do this.

11:30.308 --> 11:31.307
You know what?

11:31.309 --> 11:34.310
<i>This is just pathetic.</i>

11:35.646 --> 11:36.646
Give it to me.

11:36.648 --> 11:38.514
What are you
going to do with it?

11:38.516 --> 11:39.398
I'm gonna open it.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.400
Oh, you think?
Okay.

11:41.402 --> 11:42.852
Go ahead, Houdini.

11:42.854 --> 11:43.770
You need this?

11:43.772 --> 11:45.271
No, I don't
need that.

11:54.448 --> 11:56.398
Very nice.

11:58.902 --> 12:00.903
You know, uh...
you know what you are?

12:00.905 --> 12:01.954
Yeah, smarter than you.

12:01.956 --> 12:03.623
Smarter than you.
Nope, that's...

12:03.625 --> 12:05.341
that's not
what I was gonna say.

12:05.343 --> 12:07.627
STEVE:
<i>You're welcome, by the way.</i>

12:23.593 --> 12:25.144
What is that?

12:33.453 --> 12:36.122
Where'd you say
that beach cleanup was again?

12:36.124 --> 12:38.291
Ki'i Dunes.

12:39.209 --> 12:41.210
You know there's been, uh,

12:41.212 --> 12:43.713
tsunami debris washing up
in that area recently, right?

12:43.715 --> 12:44.664
From the Japanese
tsunami?

12:44.666 --> 12:46.666
That was, what,
three years ago now?

12:46.668 --> 12:48.584
Little box.

12:48.586 --> 12:50.136
Big ocean.

12:50.138 --> 12:52.471
I'd say it could've taken
that long to get here.

12:58.929 --> 13:00.813
KAMEKONA (singing off-key):

13:23.820 --> 13:25.154
What are you, uh...
what are you doing?

13:25.156 --> 13:27.290
"Tiny Bubbles."

13:27.292 --> 13:28.991
Written by Leon Pober.

13:28.993 --> 13:32.328
Released by Don Ho in 1966.

13:32.330 --> 13:34.330
Ah, and butchered
by you here in 2013.

13:34.332 --> 13:35.348
I liked it.

13:35.350 --> 13:37.717
"Butchered..."
This is for you, brah.

13:37.719 --> 13:39.101
What is it?

13:39.103 --> 13:41.187
Cost of doing business.

13:41.189 --> 13:43.105
No.

13:43.107 --> 13:45.391
This is...
this-this is $300.

13:46.343 --> 13:48.728
What do you....
$300 for a ukulele?

13:48.730 --> 13:51.197
That's koa wood, brah.

13:51.199 --> 13:53.816
And good information
does not come cheap.

13:53.818 --> 13:56.202
Especially during
the holiday season.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.627
Wow. You actually
have a wallet.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.050
I got $80, all right?

14:11.052 --> 14:12.218
That's all I got.

14:12.220 --> 14:14.971
Figures.
Here, you thief.

14:14.973 --> 14:17.539
$220 more.

14:19.876 --> 14:21.844
North Shore bruddah
hooked us up

14:21.846 --> 14:23.879
with the name
of your dead thief.

14:23.881 --> 14:24.847
Victor Dobbs.

14:24.849 --> 14:29.051
Word is, worked
strictly big scores.

14:29.053 --> 14:31.320
Mostly diamonds
and jewelry.

14:31.322 --> 14:33.005
STEVE:
Victor Dobbs.

14:33.007 --> 14:34.740
Currently
unemployed.

14:34.742 --> 14:36.826
Last job...

14:36.828 --> 14:39.378
He was a manager
at the Wailana

14:39.380 --> 14:40.746
Electronics Supply Company.

14:40.748 --> 14:42.448
Well, with his background,

14:42.450 --> 14:44.667
that's how he could've learned
how to bypass a security system.

14:44.669 --> 14:47.169
It didn't teach him how to dodge
a bullet, though, did it?

14:57.631 --> 14:59.882
Looks like
he lived alone.

15:04.855 --> 15:06.439
(glass shatters)

15:14.314 --> 15:15.614
How ironic.

15:26.043 --> 15:27.460
Whoa.

15:27.462 --> 15:29.328
Sorry. Wrong house.
Hey!

15:29.330 --> 15:30.830
Show me your hands.
Behind your head.

15:30.832 --> 15:32.281
Interlock your fingers.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.333
Easy, man.

15:34.335 --> 15:37.286
Aren't you
a little early, Santa?

15:45.349 --> 15:46.983
CATHERINE: We checked out
that last half

15:46.985 --> 15:48.717
that Danny found
in our vic's place.

15:48.719 --> 15:50.019
These right here were taken
inside the homes

15:50.021 --> 15:52.554
that our burglar already hit,
and these over here,

15:52.556 --> 15:54.240
these were part
of his wish list.

15:54.242 --> 15:56.242
What, these are places,
uh, Dobbs cased

15:56.244 --> 15:57.393
and was intending to rob?

15:57.395 --> 15:58.494
CHIN: That's right
and wrong.

15:58.496 --> 15:59.862
These were places
he was going to hit,

15:59.864 --> 16:01.230
but he didn't do the casing.

16:01.232 --> 16:03.015
That was all done by our guest,

16:03.017 --> 16:04.550
Tim Sapoli.

16:04.552 --> 16:05.968
Got a hit
off his prints.

16:05.970 --> 16:07.420
He's got multiple priors.

16:07.422 --> 16:08.504
Did some time
in Halawa.

16:08.506 --> 16:09.422
He's currently
employed

16:09.424 --> 16:10.923
as a cable TV
installer.

16:10.925 --> 16:12.925
And it looks like
he's our victim's partner.

16:12.927 --> 16:14.343
How do we know that?

16:14.345 --> 16:16.078
Because he's the
one who e-mailed

16:16.080 --> 16:17.963
those photos
to Victor Dobbs.

16:17.965 --> 16:19.849
Let's cut to the chase and talk
about what happened with Dobbs,

16:19.851 --> 16:21.634
okay? I'm thinking
it was about money.

16:21.636 --> 16:22.918
Maybe he wasn't
paying you enough.

16:22.920 --> 16:24.887
Maybe you wanted to renegotiate
the terms of your deal

16:24.889 --> 16:26.222
with him and
it went south.

16:26.224 --> 16:28.524
Uh, I'm guessing that's
why you killed him.

16:28.526 --> 16:29.859
Whoa.

16:29.861 --> 16:31.944
What?

16:31.946 --> 16:33.262
What are you
talking about?

16:33.264 --> 16:34.763
Dobbs is dead?

16:36.149 --> 16:38.317
What?
You think I killed him?

16:38.319 --> 16:39.535
CATHERINE:
We think you put

16:39.537 --> 16:40.736
a bullet in him,
dumped the body,

16:40.738 --> 16:41.787
then broke
into his house

16:41.789 --> 16:43.205
and tried to steal
the computer

16:43.207 --> 16:44.657
so that you wouldn't
be linked to the photos.

16:44.659 --> 16:47.109
Listen, okay?

16:47.111 --> 16:49.278
The burglaries?

16:49.280 --> 16:50.329
Fine.

16:50.331 --> 16:52.448
I helped pull
those off.

16:52.450 --> 16:54.750
But murder?
No way.

16:54.752 --> 16:55.885
I didn't kill Dobbs.

16:55.887 --> 16:57.837
You're going to have
to do better than that.

16:57.839 --> 16:59.555
I haven't seen him for days.

16:59.557 --> 17:02.091
We were supposed to meet up
after the last score,

17:02.093 --> 17:03.642
split the take...
What score?

17:03.644 --> 17:04.560
I don't know.

17:04.561 --> 17:06.429
My job was to feed
him the leads,

17:06.431 --> 17:07.646
but he never told me

17:07.647 --> 17:09.464
which house he was gonna hit.
CATHERINE: So, what?

17:09.467 --> 17:11.233
He just didn't show up for the split?
Nope.

17:11.234 --> 17:13.185
Never showed.

17:13.186 --> 17:14.854
I kept calling him,
but he wasn't answering.

17:14.856 --> 17:17.806
I figured something
must've happened.

17:17.808 --> 17:19.992
I don't know,
maybe he pulled the plug...

17:19.993 --> 17:21.444
Maybe he got arrested.

17:21.445 --> 17:23.746
I never figured he'd
get himself killed.

17:25.315 --> 17:28.416
You really expect us
to believe that?

17:28.419 --> 17:31.337
Why would I want
my partner dead?

17:32.172 --> 17:34.373
Dobbs was my meal ticket.

17:35.492 --> 17:37.326
DANNY: So, what...
you believe him?

17:37.328 --> 17:39.845
Well, first of all,
Sapoli's got no alibi.

17:39.847 --> 17:41.614
Second of all,
we caught him breaking into

17:41.616 --> 17:43.048
the victim's house
to destroy evidence.

17:43.050 --> 17:45.484
So do I believe him?
No, I don't believe him.

17:45.486 --> 17:47.219
But until we get something
solid on this guy,

17:47.221 --> 17:48.487
all we got is
a burglary charge.

17:48.489 --> 17:50.222
Hey.

17:50.224 --> 17:53.309
My guys finished searching
your suspect Sapoli's place.

17:53.311 --> 17:55.227
They found a weapon...
Glock nine-mil.

17:55.229 --> 17:57.396
That's the same caliber
used to kill Dobbs.

17:57.398 --> 17:58.697
Yeah. I'm running it
against the slug

17:58.699 --> 18:00.116
that Max found,
but it's so degraded,

18:00.118 --> 18:01.850
it's a long shot.
But even if we get

18:01.852 --> 18:03.869
a match, we still have
to put him at the crime scene.

18:03.871 --> 18:04.486
If we could find it.

18:04.511 --> 18:06.456
CATHERINE: Okay, well,
given the latex found

18:06.457 --> 18:08.357
under Dobbs' fingernail,
he might have been killed

18:08.359 --> 18:09.708
right after his last burglary.

18:09.710 --> 18:11.327
So if we can
figure out

18:11.329 --> 18:13.262
where that was, we can
canvass the neighborhood,

18:13.264 --> 18:16.048
maybe turn up a
witness or a security cam

18:16.050 --> 18:17.866
that puts Sapoli in the area
around the time of death.

18:17.868 --> 18:19.251
GROVER: The problem is, there
were no burglaries

18:19.253 --> 18:20.753
reported last night.

18:20.755 --> 18:23.222
All right, well, maybe, uh...
homeowners were out of town.

18:23.224 --> 18:24.924
Well, considering the skill
of your burglar,

18:24.926 --> 18:26.809
these people might not even
know they're victims yet.

18:26.811 --> 18:28.043
STEVE : Catherine, pull up
Dobbs's wish list...

18:28.045 --> 18:30.429
all the houses
he was targeting.

18:30.431 --> 18:33.232
I can take it one step further
and create a map.

18:33.234 --> 18:35.601
STEVE:
Okay.

18:35.603 --> 18:36.885
Chin, Cath,

18:36.887 --> 18:38.471
split up these addresses,
go door-to-door,

18:38.473 --> 18:41.357
see if any of these places
were hit last night.

18:41.359 --> 18:42.741
You got my guys, too,
if you need 'em.

18:42.743 --> 18:44.243
Thank you.
(phone ringing)

18:44.245 --> 18:46.395
Charlie, what do you got?
FONG: <i>I managed to reconstruct</i>

18:46.397 --> 18:47.913
the bullet Max removed
from your victim.

18:47.915 --> 18:50.416
There was enough land and groove
impressions for me to determine

18:50.418 --> 18:52.117
that the round was
fired by a Browning.

18:52.119 --> 18:54.036
No, no.

18:54.038 --> 18:56.088
The, uh, gun HPD recovered
from Sapoli's house...

18:56.090 --> 18:57.790
Was a Glock.
...was a Glock.

18:57.792 --> 18:58.841
Which could mean your suspect

18:58.843 --> 19:00.009
shot the victim
using a different gun.

19:00.011 --> 19:02.094
Or he wasn't the killer.

19:03.129 --> 19:04.346
I also processed
the tarp

19:04.348 --> 19:05.747
that your victim's body
was found wrapped in.

19:05.749 --> 19:06.799
Contacted
the manufacturer.

19:06.801 --> 19:09.602
Production was
discontinued six years ago,

19:09.604 --> 19:11.437
so I'm trying
to narrow down

19:11.439 --> 19:12.471
what retailers
sold them.

19:12.473 --> 19:13.755
As soon as I can put together

19:13.757 --> 19:15.107
a list of transaction records,
I'll call you.

19:15.109 --> 19:16.258
All right, mahalo.

19:16.260 --> 19:17.142
All right.

19:17.144 --> 19:18.310
Give me one minute?
Yeah.

19:18.312 --> 19:20.312
Go.

19:20.314 --> 19:22.114
Hey, Charlie.

19:22.116 --> 19:23.432
I know you got
plenty to do,

19:23.434 --> 19:25.951
but, um, my daughter found
this, uh, on the beach.

19:25.953 --> 19:28.437
Thought maybe you'd
take a look at it.

19:28.439 --> 19:29.955
It's a puzzle box.

19:29.957 --> 19:32.741
Got significant water damage.
Yeah.

19:32.743 --> 19:34.710
I... looks like it's been in
the water for a couple years.

19:34.712 --> 19:36.245
I was thinking
that maybe it, uh,

19:36.247 --> 19:39.248
it washed up here from
the tsunami in Japan.

19:39.250 --> 19:41.283
It's quite possible.

19:41.285 --> 19:43.419
If you get any time,
please, uh, look at it.

19:43.421 --> 19:45.137
It means a lot to Grace.

19:45.972 --> 19:47.256
And you.

19:47.258 --> 19:48.807
Yes.

19:48.809 --> 19:51.010
Uh, and me.
Look.

19:52.345 --> 19:54.430
A lot of people died
in that tsunami, Charlie,

19:54.432 --> 19:56.482
and, uh...

19:56.484 --> 19:59.151
this little girl here,
uh,... I can only assume

19:59.153 --> 20:01.020
she meant a lot to
somebody, so I'd like

20:01.022 --> 20:03.572
to find out what happened
to her, that's all.

20:06.660 --> 20:08.694
I'll do my best.

20:15.335 --> 20:17.836
CHIN: <i>Just checked the sixth house</i>
<i>off my list.</i>

20:17.838 --> 20:19.955
Nothing yet.
How are you making out?

20:19.957 --> 20:22.258
I've hit four. Got nothing.

20:22.260 --> 20:23.459
Four?

20:23.461 --> 20:24.960
To my six?

20:24.962 --> 20:27.513
Aren't you the one driving
around in a muscle car?

20:27.515 --> 20:28.681
Hey, you saw my list.

20:28.683 --> 20:30.466
My houses cover
a wider area than yours.

20:30.468 --> 20:31.884
(chuckles)
Okay, then.

20:31.886 --> 20:33.185
What do you say the last person

20:33.187 --> 20:34.836
who gets to the bottom
of their list

20:34.838 --> 20:36.355
picks up the next tab
at Side Street?

20:36.357 --> 20:38.340
You're on.

20:38.342 --> 20:40.526
(engine revs)

20:50.120 --> 20:51.737
Hi. Can I help you?
Aloha.

20:51.739 --> 20:53.522
I'm Lieutenant Kelly.
I'm with Five-O.

20:53.524 --> 20:55.324
Gary Nathan.
What can I do for you?

20:55.326 --> 20:57.025
Well, Mr. Nathan,
we're investigating

20:57.027 --> 20:58.410
a rash of break-ins
in the area.

20:58.412 --> 21:00.045
We have reason
to believe

21:00.047 --> 21:01.196
that your home
has been targeted.

21:01.198 --> 21:02.864
Are you serious?
Did you have any cable

21:02.866 --> 21:04.366
or Internet work
done here recently?

21:04.368 --> 21:06.702
Yeah.

21:06.704 --> 21:08.003
Uh, a few weeks ago,

21:08.005 --> 21:09.138
I had a new Wi-Fi
system installed.

21:09.140 --> 21:11.890
But what does that have
to do with being robbed?

21:11.892 --> 21:13.225
Our suspects are
using service calls

21:13.227 --> 21:14.760
to access
people's homes.

21:14.762 --> 21:16.428
A lot of our victims
don't even know

21:16.430 --> 21:17.846
that they've been
burglarized until days

21:17.848 --> 21:19.648
or weeks
after the fact.

21:19.650 --> 21:21.650
Mind if I take
a look around?

21:21.652 --> 21:22.735
It'll only take
a couple of minutes.

21:22.737 --> 21:24.186
Oh, of course, yeah.
Whatever you need.

21:24.188 --> 21:25.854
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

21:32.395 --> 21:33.445
Nice place.

21:33.447 --> 21:34.913
How long you been here?

21:34.915 --> 21:36.415
Couple years.

21:36.417 --> 21:38.367
Before that?
Denver.

21:38.369 --> 21:40.285
We used to vacation
in Hawaii when I was a kid,

21:40.287 --> 21:42.070
so when the opportunity came up,
I moved here.

21:42.072 --> 21:43.872
Denver, huh?
You a skier?

21:43.874 --> 21:45.591
Used to be.

21:45.593 --> 21:47.126
If you ever get the urge,
you ought to try

21:47.128 --> 21:48.177
Mauna Kea.

21:48.179 --> 21:49.244
It's on
Hawaii Island.

21:49.246 --> 21:52.080
Actually snows there
a couple times a year.

21:52.082 --> 21:55.417
Locals call it, uh...
pineapple powder.

21:55.419 --> 21:56.769
I'll have to
check that out.

21:56.771 --> 21:57.970
Yeah.

22:04.194 --> 22:06.428
Mind if I take a look
at your wall safe?

22:06.430 --> 22:08.781
How did you know I have
a wall safe?

22:08.783 --> 22:10.816
As part of the investigation,
we confiscated photos

22:10.818 --> 22:12.234
of the homes that were cased.

22:12.236 --> 22:14.486
And as I mentioned earlier,
yours was targeted.

22:14.488 --> 22:16.938
Yes, you did say that.

22:16.940 --> 22:18.657
It's over here.

22:23.797 --> 22:25.381
Here we go.

22:32.055 --> 22:34.139
Did the safe come
with the house?

22:34.141 --> 22:36.124
No, I had it installed.

22:37.293 --> 22:39.228
I'm gonna need you
to open it up.

22:39.230 --> 22:40.763
Excuse me?

22:40.765 --> 22:43.732
I just need you to verify that
everything's accounted for.

22:45.819 --> 22:48.821
Oh. I don't need
to see what's inside.

22:48.823 --> 22:50.389
All right.

22:50.391 --> 22:51.774
Of course.

22:59.582 --> 23:01.750
All good.

23:01.752 --> 23:04.036
Okay, you can close it back up.

23:06.322 --> 23:07.656
What is it?

23:09.259 --> 23:11.260
It's tinfoil.

23:11.262 --> 23:13.879
Ah, probably
a gum wrapper.

23:16.182 --> 23:19.167
Burglars use tinfoil
to bypass security systems.

23:29.937 --> 23:32.623
♪

23:57.181 --> 23:59.865
Well, at least your prowler has
uptown taste. All his targets

23:59.866 --> 24:00.849
are in affluent areas.

24:00.851 --> 24:02.216
We can forget
about pawnshops.

24:02.218 --> 24:04.719
This merch is being moved
through a local fence.

24:04.721 --> 24:05.987
OFFICER:
Excuse me, gentlemen.

24:05.989 --> 24:07.605
DANNY:
Hey.

24:07.607 --> 24:08.990
Commander McGarrett?
Detective Williams?

24:08.992 --> 24:10.057
That's right.

24:10.059 --> 24:11.109
This is Captain Grover.

24:11.111 --> 24:12.226
How can we help you?
Ma'am.

24:12.228 --> 24:14.779
Special Agent
Rebecca Conway, FBI.

24:14.781 --> 24:15.864
How do you do?

24:15.866 --> 24:17.415
HPD Crime Lab
ran a search

24:17.417 --> 24:19.033
that flagged a case
I'm working.

24:19.035 --> 24:21.202
Specifically, the tarp
and firearm information

24:21.204 --> 24:23.955
that was entered
linked to a series of murders

24:23.957 --> 24:25.540
that I'm covering.

24:25.542 --> 24:27.926
Our suspect's killed
14 people that we know of.

24:27.928 --> 24:29.594
12 on the mainland,
two in Hawaii.

24:29.596 --> 24:32.680
You're saying we have
a serial killer on the Island?

24:32.682 --> 24:34.098
Why are we hearing
about this now?

24:34.100 --> 24:36.100
We've been after this
guy for long time.

24:36.102 --> 24:37.519
Didn't want to scare him
into the wind.

24:37.521 --> 24:40.355
And you think we're chasing
the same guy?

24:40.357 --> 24:41.639
I'm not totally convinced,

24:41.641 --> 24:43.975
but that's why I'm here:
to compare notes.

24:43.977 --> 24:45.393
What do you got?

24:55.171 --> 24:58.122
In every case, our suspect
holds the victims

24:58.124 --> 24:59.574
for less than 24 hours.

24:59.576 --> 25:01.459
<i>All are bound and tortured.</i>

25:01.461 --> 25:03.912
<i>The C.O.D. is always the same:</i>

25:03.914 --> 25:06.130
<i>a single gunshot wound</i>
<i>to the head</i>

25:06.132 --> 25:08.800
<i>using nine-millimeter jacketed</i>
<i>hollow cavity bullets.</i>

25:08.802 --> 25:10.952
<i>We think this</i>
<i>is a mercy killing</i>

25:10.954 --> 25:13.788
<i>after the horrific abuse</i>
<i>that he inflicts.</i>

25:13.790 --> 25:16.007
GROVER: <i>So you're sure</i>
<i>that the killer's male?</i>

25:16.009 --> 25:17.258
CONWAY:
<i>The kind of atrocities</i>

25:17.260 --> 25:19.394
<i>associated with this killer</i>
<i>seem to be</i>

25:19.396 --> 25:21.012
a function of masculine traits.

25:21.014 --> 25:23.798
Particularly the way
he disposes of the bodies;

25:23.800 --> 25:24.766
he's very practical.

25:24.768 --> 25:27.301
He strips the victims
of their clothing,

25:27.303 --> 25:29.571
wraps them in
a plastic tarp

25:29.573 --> 25:31.639
<i>and dumps them</i>
<i>in random locations.</i>

25:31.641 --> 25:34.692
<i>The killer also likes to cut</i>
<i>a single finger</i>

25:34.694 --> 25:37.478
<i>from each victim's hand,</i>
<i>which he keeps as a souvenir.</i>

25:37.480 --> 25:38.830
STEVE:
<i>So he can relive</i>

25:38.832 --> 25:40.582
the fantasy
at a later date, right?

25:40.584 --> 25:43.034
Right. Now, what
I can't figure out

25:43.036 --> 25:45.253
is that up
until this point,

25:45.255 --> 25:47.321
all the victims have been
females in their 20s,

25:47.323 --> 25:50.258
most likely targeted
for those specific traits.

25:50.260 --> 25:51.759
Your victim is male.

25:51.761 --> 25:53.461
And he's not missing a finger.
Right.

25:53.463 --> 25:56.431
But other than that,
the M.O. fits.

25:56.433 --> 26:00.635
I'm just not sure why
my guy picked Mr. Dobbs.

26:00.637 --> 26:02.937
Maybe your guy
didn't pick Mr. Dobbs.

26:02.939 --> 26:05.223
Maybe Mr. Dobbs picked him.

26:06.442 --> 26:07.558
What do you mean?

26:07.560 --> 26:08.526
We know Dobbs

26:08.528 --> 26:10.228
was a burglar. We also know

26:10.230 --> 26:12.947
that he pulled a job the
night he was killed, okay?

26:12.949 --> 26:15.066
Now, what if he was in
the middle of that job

26:15.068 --> 26:16.401
when this went down?

26:16.403 --> 26:18.703
You're saying he broke
into the killer's house.

26:18.705 --> 26:21.039
So that means

26:21.041 --> 26:23.691
that he didn't choose
to change his M.O.,

26:23.693 --> 26:25.493
but your victim forced him to.

26:25.495 --> 26:26.911
What I'm saying
is it's possible.

26:26.913 --> 26:28.379
Do you have an address?

26:28.381 --> 26:30.531
We have people out in the field
working on that right now.

26:30.533 --> 26:33.301
Pull them back. Do it now.
If this guy knows he's cornered,

26:33.303 --> 26:35.503
he's going to run
or do what he does best,

26:35.505 --> 26:37.038
which is take another life.

26:37.923 --> 26:40.374
Hey, Steve...
Leilani, you all right?

26:40.376 --> 26:42.376
Yeah. I'm sorry. Um, I've
been trying to reach Chin.

26:42.378 --> 26:43.761
We were supposed to meet
a couple hours ago.

26:43.763 --> 26:46.147
Have you heard
from him?

26:48.934 --> 26:51.686
(line ringing)

26:53.489 --> 26:54.772
He's not answering.

26:56.325 --> 26:58.392
If there's something
wrong, please tell me.

26:58.394 --> 27:00.728
Hold on.

27:03.732 --> 27:05.083
Cath, Catherine, where are you?

27:05.085 --> 27:07.085
Pearl City. Why?
What's going on?

27:07.087 --> 27:08.920
Have you heard from Chin?

27:08.922 --> 27:10.088
No, not recently.

27:10.090 --> 27:11.756
Why?

27:11.758 --> 27:13.758
Okay, okay, listen to me
very carefully.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.043
I need you to stand down.

27:15.045 --> 27:17.345
HPD's gonna hit the rest
of the houses on that list.

27:17.347 --> 27:19.714
Do me a favor.
Call your people, okay?

27:19.716 --> 27:22.383
Tell them we've lost
contact with one of ours.

27:22.385 --> 27:24.519
We're gonna need
all the help we can get.

27:56.336 --> 27:59.003
you think you're
doing, Gary...

27:59.005 --> 28:02.757
but as far as I'm concerned,
all you did was kill somebody

28:02.759 --> 28:05.309
who broke into
your house.

28:07.129 --> 28:09.263
You know, a jury might look
at that as self-defense,

28:09.265 --> 28:10.631
but if you kill me,

28:10.633 --> 28:12.299
you're gonna die in prison.

28:12.301 --> 28:14.185
You understand that, right?

Huh?

Or maybe it's one in particular,

on total strangers.

30:29.488 --> 30:31.873
What, your mommy hurt you?

30:31.875 --> 30:32.907
Huh?

Maybe she locked
you up in a closet

just leave the soup and go.
