00:13.620 --> 00:16.704
I know Tony's running things.
I don't want to speak out of turn.

00:16.790 --> 00:19.197
- I don't know who else to talk to.
- About what?

00:19.292 --> 00:23.871
The president's planning military action
based on a recording from Ali's apartment.

00:23.964 --> 00:27.000
- Ali claims it was a fake.
- And you believe him.

00:27.092 --> 00:29.215
Sir, it's Jack Bauer for you.

00:29.302 --> 00:32.837
I regret to inform you,
Syed Ali has just been assassinated.

00:32.931 --> 00:36.217
I think it has to do with the conversation
recorded in Cyprus.

00:36.309 --> 00:39.678
- I don't believe it's genuine.
- OK, I'm aware of his denials.

00:39.771 --> 00:42.772
I'm worried that someone
is trying to manipulate you

00:42.858 --> 00:46.558
into taking the kind of military action
I assume you're about to take.

00:46.653 --> 00:49.903
I told you I had money.
I didn't come here to steal.

00:49.990 --> 00:52.659
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

00:55.203 --> 00:57.279
Give me the gun.

00:57.372 --> 01:00.243
- No.
- We've got the store surrounded.

01:00.333 --> 01:04.378
- Oh, no. No.
- Put the gun down and come out.

01:05.297 --> 01:06.376
This is Bauer.

01:06.465 --> 01:07.762
The recording they found,

01:07.962 --> 01:10.296
in case you haven't
figured it out, is bogus.

01:10.385 --> 01:13.054
- How do you know that?
- I'm the one who planted it.

01:13.138 --> 01:15.545
- What do you want?
- Kate Warner.

01:15.640 --> 01:20.302
You got 30 minutes. Bring her
to the warehouse, just the two of you.

01:20.395 --> 01:23.978
- Where the hell you going?
- I don't have time to explain.

01:24.065 --> 01:27.731
- Let's find the time.
- Put the gun down.

01:29.362 --> 01:32.067
Kate, come on, we gotta go.
Now. Let's go.

01:34.367 --> 01:35.149
Jack!

01:46.963 --> 01:49.501
Come on.

01:49.591 --> 01:53.042
Wait, Jack. Tell me what's going on.

01:55.305 --> 01:57.214
Do you trust me?

01:57.307 --> 02:01.886
- Kate, do you trust me?
- Yes.

02:01.978 --> 02:05.976
I will explain everything to you in the car,
but we've gotta go now.

02:11.822 --> 02:14.609
- Carrie!
- Tony!

02:14.699 --> 02:17.653
- What happened?
- It was Jack.

02:17.744 --> 02:20.994
I tried to stop him from taking
Kate Warner out of here.

02:21.081 --> 02:23.157
- What is it?
- My ankle.

02:23.250 --> 02:27.497
- I'll get the medic.
- Call Security. Make sure they stop Jack.

02:27.587 --> 02:28.667
Yeah.

02:46.314 --> 02:48.805
Security.

02:50.360 --> 02:51.735
He's at the gate.

02:52.696 --> 02:57.025
- Stop that vehicle!
- Hey! Stop!

03:00.745 --> 03:02.987
- You OK?
- Yeah.

03:03.081 --> 03:07.708
I didn't mean to frighten you back there.
Let me try and explain everything to you.

03:07.794 --> 03:12.337
The US is preparing to retaliate against
the Middle East for what happened tonight.

03:12.424 --> 03:16.885
The next few hours, we'll be involved in a full-scale war
which'll affect every country on this planet.

03:16.970 --> 03:19.093
What does that have to do with me?

03:19.181 --> 03:21.506
Ten minutes ago a man called me.

03:21.600 --> 03:26.143
Said he had proof the evidence the president
was basing his decisions on was forged.

03:26.229 --> 03:30.274
He wouldn't give me any other information
unless I brought you to him.

03:30.358 --> 03:32.766
- Who is this man?
- I don't know.

03:32.861 --> 03:36.396
That's the problem, Kate.
I don't know who he is.

03:36.490 --> 03:39.693
- What would he want with me?
- We've gotta find out.

03:39.785 --> 03:45.538
If I can provide concrete proof that the Cyprus
recording was fake, we can stop a war.

03:45.624 --> 03:48.827
I will do what I can to protect you,
but you have to decide now.

03:48.919 --> 03:52.916
You have to decide whether or not
you want to accept the risk.

03:54.633 --> 03:57.503
Do you really think we can do this?

04:00.514 --> 04:04.725
I'm not gonna lie to you.
This is very, very dangerous.

04:06.645 --> 04:11.556
I'm sorry, I don't know what else to do.
I'm running out of time.

04:18.615 --> 04:21.106
- Did they stop him?
- He drove through the gate.

04:21.201 --> 04:23.953
- What's the problem?
- My ankle.

04:24.037 --> 04:26.279
Let's take a look.

04:26.373 --> 04:30.667
- Did you call LAPD?
- And the FBI. They're all looking for him.

04:30.752 --> 04:34.002
Could be a torn ligament, maybe a sprain.
It's not broken.

04:34.089 --> 04:36.331
- We've gotta get you an x-ray.
- Great.

04:36.424 --> 04:38.501
I'll be right back with a first-aid kit.

04:38.593 --> 04:41.594
- You said Jack took Kate with him?
- Yeah.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.800
- I don't think he was working alone.
- What do you mean?

04:44.891 --> 04:49.304
Baker was keeping an eye on Kate. Michelle
distracted him just before I found you.

04:49.396 --> 04:52.516
- Distracted him how?
- She called him away on paperwork.

04:52.607 --> 04:55.857
That doesn't mean
they were working together.

04:55.944 --> 05:00.156
I think it does. Michelle was talking
to Jack right before she went to Baker.

05:00.240 --> 05:04.072
- He might have been setting her up.
- It didn't appear that way.

05:07.789 --> 05:10.707
The vice president's ready
for your call, sir.

05:10.792 --> 05:16.462
- When's he meet the British ambassador?
- Right after he speaks with you.

05:24.181 --> 05:27.016
The vice president will want you
to authorise him

05:27.100 --> 05:30.683
to inform the ambassador
of our deployment.

05:30.771 --> 05:33.937
- He told you that?
- You know where Jim stands on this.

05:34.024 --> 05:38.899
He'll want to let everyone know we're
on a war footing. Especially the British.

05:39.446 --> 05:41.818
What's your position, sir?

05:42.616 --> 05:48.405
Once we bring our allies in on this, it'll
make it much harder to recall those planes.

05:48.497 --> 05:52.541
- Put him through.
- The president is ready to speak with him.

05:52.626 --> 05:55.461
- Right away.
- Thank you.

05:55.545 --> 05:59.625
Hello, Jim.

05:59.716 --> 06:02.088
What's the British reaction
to the bombing?

06:02.177 --> 06:05.380
Everyone is stunned.
Their military is on high alert.

06:05.472 --> 06:09.552
- The British ambassador?
- He's waiting to hear from us.

06:09.643 --> 06:13.723
After this conversation, I'm free
to inform him about the Stealth bombers?

06:13.814 --> 06:16.731
Not just yet, Jim. It's still premature.

06:16.817 --> 06:20.897
Those planes are due to drop their
payloads in a little over four hours.

06:20.987 --> 06:23.063
We're holding off notifying our allies

06:23.156 --> 06:26.691
because there's a possibility
we may not go through with the attack.

06:27.494 --> 06:29.652
I don't understand.

06:29.746 --> 06:32.700
I have reason to believe
the Cyprus audio implicating

06:32.791 --> 06:35.198
the target countries was fabricated.

06:35.293 --> 06:38.876
- I thought we proved it was real.
- As did I.

06:38.964 --> 06:43.709
CTU LA is in the process of obtaining
intelligence that may show otherwise.

06:43.802 --> 06:44.964
In the process?

06:45.053 --> 06:48.921
- Meaning they don't have any proof yet.
- Correct.

06:49.015 --> 06:53.179
Did you run it by CIA? Did they have
any indication this thing's a fraud?

06:53.270 --> 06:55.143
Not as of yet.

06:55.230 --> 07:01.066
Mr President, you authorised
this military action, and justifiably so.

07:01.153 --> 07:04.985
With all due respect,
it's too late for second thoughts.

07:05.782 --> 07:09.780
We will not start a war
on false or incomplete information.

07:09.870 --> 07:14.995
- Say nothing to the ambassador.
- Yes, Mr President.

07:18.962 --> 07:23.624
Mr President...
I know you trust Jack Bauer implicitly,

07:23.717 --> 07:28.628
but to equivocate our response
in a matter of this importance

07:28.722 --> 07:32.933
because of one man's reservations
makes me very uncomfortable.

07:34.811 --> 07:37.219
I'm afraid I'm with Mike on this one, sir.

07:39.399 --> 07:41.522
Noted.

07:49.242 --> 07:54.616
This is Deputy Raynes. Mr Garcia,
we have officers surrounding the building.

07:54.706 --> 07:57.541
Your only option
is to throw your weapon out

07:57.626 --> 07:59.951
and come out with your hands on your head.

08:00.045 --> 08:04.173
Stay with me. No. No!

08:05.342 --> 08:08.508
I can't stop the bleeding.
We need to get him to a hospital.

08:08.595 --> 08:11.798
- Please don't let him die.
- We need you to respond.

08:11.890 --> 08:15.176
You need to talk to the police.
Tell them you'll give up.

08:15.268 --> 08:19.562
- We gotta let them in here right now.
- No, I didn't mean for this to happen.

08:19.648 --> 08:25.520
A bomb went off. There's gonna be a war.
I was just trying to protect my wife.

08:25.612 --> 08:28.447
- She's pregnant.
- I will tell the police that.

08:28.532 --> 08:32.659
- We gotta get out of here!
- Mr Garcia, please respond.

08:32.744 --> 08:36.493
Do you have someone in there
who needs medical attention?

08:36.581 --> 08:38.703
- We can work this out.
- Stay with me.

08:38.792 --> 08:42.706
But first you have to put
the weapon down and come out.

08:46.174 --> 08:48.463
Let's walk out of here.

08:50.345 --> 08:54.295
Come out, Mr Garcia. You're only
making things worse by prolonging it.

08:55.475 --> 08:56.506
No!

08:56.601 --> 08:59.175
We can work this out,
but you have to work with us.

08:59.271 --> 09:01.643
Oh, please don't die.

09:01.731 --> 09:04.436
- Please don't let him die.
- Please respond.

09:09.656 --> 09:12.906
Why won't they help you, back at CTU?

09:12.993 --> 09:17.489
Tony Almeida's in charge. He's under
pressure. He doesn't think it's a forgery,

09:17.581 --> 09:22.243
so he's following the proper protocol.
He's doing what he thinks is right.

09:23.503 --> 09:28.580
- Where are we supposed to meet him?
- A small warehouse in Studio City.

09:34.681 --> 09:37.765
- What is it?
- We're being followed.

09:37.851 --> 09:41.718
- Who do you think it is?
- I don't know. Hold on.

09:59.623 --> 10:04.700
Turn the ignition off! Put your hands
on the wheel! Put your hands on the wheel!

10:07.380 --> 10:09.669
- You alone?
- Yeah.

10:09.758 --> 10:13.672
- Why did you follow me from CTU?
- No one's given me any information.

10:13.762 --> 10:18.638
I told you at CTU that my country is being
implicated. I don't know who I can trust.

10:18.725 --> 10:23.968
I saw you take out Tony, who's in charge.
You don't want your country to invade mine.

10:24.064 --> 10:28.726
My agenda is not to help your country. My
responsibility is to make sure the president

10:28.819 --> 10:32.982
- makes his decisions based on fact.
- My country's not responsible.

10:33.073 --> 10:38.067
Maybe, but Ali is a citizen of your country.
He runs his terrorist network from there.

10:38.161 --> 10:42.455
Yes, which means he's a criminal
to my government just as much as yours.

10:42.541 --> 10:47.416
Why would my country deliberately provoke
an attack that would decimate us?

10:47.504 --> 10:50.458
We have everything to lose, nothing to gain.

10:56.304 --> 10:58.012
What do you want?

10:58.098 --> 11:02.226
When you broke out, you isolated yourself.
You'll need help.

11:07.023 --> 11:08.648
- Tony.
- Yeah?

11:08.733 --> 11:10.241
What did the doctor say?

11:10.441 --> 11:13.395
I don't know, they think
I tore a ligament or something.

11:13.488 --> 11:18.316
Look... Carrie told me
that she saw you talking to Jack,

11:18.410 --> 11:21.577
right before he took Kate Warner out of CTU.

11:21.663 --> 11:26.788
- Yeah. Is that a problem?
- It depends what you were talking about.

11:27.752 --> 11:29.959
What were you talking about?

11:31.298 --> 11:33.753
Are you interrogating me?

11:37.804 --> 11:41.304
Did you help Jack
take Kate Warner out of here?

11:41.391 --> 11:44.013
Of course not.

11:44.102 --> 11:47.187
Is that what Carrie told you?
I'm in collusion with Jack?

11:47.272 --> 11:50.190
- Yeah.
- I don't know what to tell you.

11:50.275 --> 11:53.229
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.811
Look, Michelle.

11:55.906 --> 11:59.405
It doesn't matter whether
you think Jack is right or wrong.

11:59.493 --> 12:04.320
The fact is, this is my command,
and what happens here is my responsibility.

12:04.414 --> 12:08.542
- I know that.
- So I need you to be honest with me now.

12:08.627 --> 12:13.668
Did you intentionally draw Agent Baker
away from Kate Warner?

12:14.800 --> 12:18.050
No. I did not.

12:18.136 --> 12:23.213
- So why would Carrie tell me you did?
- Because she'd like to see me out of here.

12:23.308 --> 12:24.494
And why's that?

12:24.794 --> 12:27.935
Because I don't like
her, and she knows it.

12:29.606 --> 12:33.390
- You wanna tell me about it?
- No, not really.

12:34.861 --> 12:40.615
- If it's interfering with your work...
- It's not interfering with my work.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.776
It's not.

12:43.537 --> 12:46.324
OK. Thanks.

13:09.646 --> 13:13.644
Mr Garcia, we are contacting you
by phone. Please answer.

13:13.733 --> 13:18.976
What have I done?!
I'm going to prison for the rest of my life.

13:19.739 --> 13:22.277
- You don't know that.
- I killed a man!

13:22.367 --> 13:24.276
It was an accident. I saw it.

13:24.369 --> 13:27.172
If you turn yourself in now,
they'll consider that.

13:27.272 --> 13:28.948
If you don't, it'll only get worse.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.531
I've got to get out of here.

13:34.254 --> 13:37.041
Hey! Don't touch that phone.

13:44.389 --> 13:47.390
- Yeah?
- Mr Garcia, this is Deputy Raynes.

13:47.476 --> 13:50.560
Now, whatever the problem is,
we can work this out.

13:50.645 --> 13:53.730
- Now, who's in there with you?
- A customer. A girl.

13:53.815 --> 13:58.311
- OK, is she hurt?
- No. It's the owner.

13:58.403 --> 14:00.526
OK, we have to get him out of there.

14:01.656 --> 14:05.322
It's too late. Look, I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.

14:05.952 --> 14:08.028
Now, that's OK. Let's talk about it.

14:08.121 --> 14:11.455
It's because of the bomb.
Look, there's gonna be a war.

14:11.541 --> 14:15.586
I'm trying to get my wife out of the city.
You understand that, right?

14:15.670 --> 14:18.755
Your wife is right here.
She's worried about you.

14:18.840 --> 14:20.833
Put her on the phone.
I wanna talk to her.

14:23.595 --> 14:27.046
Ramon, are you OK?
Why are you still in there?

14:30.185 --> 14:34.811
- Mija... I killed a man.
- No!

14:34.898 --> 14:41.482
It was an accident, but they won't believe
me. You and the baby have to leave now.

14:41.571 --> 14:44.489
It's not safe to be in the city.

14:44.991 --> 14:49.618
Ramon, mijo, come out.

14:49.704 --> 14:50.520
No, not yet.

14:50.620 --> 14:54.082
OK, look, I'm gonna tell the police
to take you where you'll be safe.

14:57.170 --> 15:01.382
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

15:06.221 --> 15:08.262
All right, Mr Garcia,
you talked to your wife.

15:08.391 --> 15:10.053
We'd like you to come out.

15:10.142 --> 15:12.633
OK, but I want you
to do one thing for me first.

15:12.727 --> 15:14.804
What's that?

15:14.896 --> 15:18.348
Take her to Monterey.
She's got a sister there.

15:18.442 --> 15:24.065
When she gets there, I'll let the girl go,
and then I'll come out.

15:50.932 --> 15:55.594
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to stay here. I'm going in.

15:55.687 --> 15:56.898
If you need to get in touch with me,

15:56.949 --> 16:00.682
there's a cellphone in the centre console.
Press one.

16:01.610 --> 16:04.231
Kate, you OK?

16:04.321 --> 16:08.698
Don't forget, I will do everything
I have to to protect you, OK?

16:09.951 --> 16:13.652
- Yeah.
- Just stay put.

17:13.140 --> 17:16.223
Drop the weapon. Put the weapon down!

17:17.477 --> 17:19.553
All right.

17:20.271 --> 17:26.523
My weapons are there on that table.
I'm unarmed.

17:26.611 --> 17:31.653
Put your hands behind your head,
interlock your fingers. You know the drill.

17:37.164 --> 17:42.205
If that's a Dunlop, it'll pick up a piece
of shrapnel that's still in my rib cage.

17:43.086 --> 17:45.624
Yep, see?

17:52.512 --> 17:54.588
Take a seat.

17:56.850 --> 17:58.677
Who are you?

17:58.769 --> 18:02.184
Jonathan Wallace, 7th Light
Armoured Reconnaissance Battalion,

18:02.272 --> 18:06.601
Third Marine Division, Special Ops
Detachment Delta, Fort Benning.

18:07.694 --> 18:10.268
Slowly... raise your right arm.

18:11.198 --> 18:14.401
Show the inside of your forearm to me.

18:23.460 --> 18:27.208
- Coral Snake Unit.
- That's right.

18:27.297 --> 18:30.168
So you're the seventh man.

18:30.258 --> 18:35.086
You took out your unit that was tracking
the bomb so they couldn't stop it. Why?

18:35.180 --> 18:37.256
I was responsible for two things:

18:37.349 --> 18:39.031
making sure the bomb went off,

18:39.231 --> 18:42.426
planting the recording to blame
it on the three countries.

18:42.521 --> 18:46.565
- To what end?
- What else, Jack? To start a war.

18:46.650 --> 18:49.853
The end game was always to get the US
to attack the Middle East.

18:49.945 --> 18:51.320
Why?

18:51.404 --> 18:53.939
They didn't tell me,
but they didn't have to.

18:54.239 --> 18:56.363
These men control the oil
in the Caspian Sea.

18:56.451 --> 19:00.781
If there's a war, their holdings quadruple
in value for at least a decade.

19:00.872 --> 19:04.158
At the cost of detonating a nuclear device
in the centre of LA?

19:04.251 --> 19:07.086
You got it.

19:07.170 --> 19:10.919
What do you want with Kate Warner?

19:11.007 --> 19:14.708
About an hour ago, the people
who hired me tried to have me killed.

19:14.803 --> 19:19.299
Obviously, they didn't succeed,
but they took out my transport team.

19:19.391 --> 19:22.392
I need an alternate way out of the country.

19:22.477 --> 19:27.472
Warner Industries has DOD variance.
She can authorise a departure.

19:27.566 --> 19:33.236
So, evidence against the Cyprus recording
for your departure. That's the deal?

19:33.321 --> 19:34.697
Yep.

20:02.058 --> 20:04.549
Keep your mouth shut
and get out of the car.

20:05.270 --> 20:08.306
Unlock the door. Do it now!

20:09.566 --> 20:11.689
Come on, get out of the car!

20:20.869 --> 20:22.945
You OK?

20:27.375 --> 20:30.827
- So where's the Warner girl?
- When we're done.

20:30.921 --> 20:34.124
How does the evidence prove
the recording was forged?

20:34.216 --> 20:38.510
I have the source recordings. Before they
were mixed down to create the fake tape.

20:41.556 --> 20:44.427
- Yeah.
- There was another guy. I took care of him.

20:44.518 --> 20:47.056
Is he there?

20:49.231 --> 20:52.148
It's for you.

20:58.323 --> 20:59.354
Hello?

20:59.449 --> 21:03.067
The man you sent to pick up Kate Warner
is unconscious. He's out.

21:03.161 --> 21:04.490
You're lying.

21:04.579 --> 21:08.494
He's six-two, dark hair,
pretty nasty scar on his face.

21:11.461 --> 21:15.079
OK. It doesn't change anything.

21:15.173 --> 21:19.005
I got what you need and I won't give it
to you until you give me Kate Warner.

21:19.094 --> 21:21.846
I'll take you to her.
We'll arrange your charter.

21:21.930 --> 21:24.088
No, no, no.

21:24.182 --> 21:27.551
She can't authorise a charter
unless a partner is on board,

21:27.644 --> 21:30.764
and right now your people
have Bob Warner in custody.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.097
So she's coming with me.

21:33.191 --> 21:36.691
What do you plan to do with her
when you reach your destination?

21:36.778 --> 21:39.483
I have to dispose of her. You know that.

21:40.824 --> 21:42.781
I can't let that happen.

21:44.161 --> 21:46.486
We're done here.

22:01.887 --> 22:03.464
Wait.

22:11.772 --> 22:16.398
- Yusuf, do you copy?
- We're here. What do you want me to do?

22:16.485 --> 22:18.561
Bring her in.

22:50.185 --> 22:52.261
Lynne.

22:54.564 --> 22:57.649
- Yeah, Mike?
- How do I get ahold of Jack Bauer?

22:58.443 --> 23:00.934
Last I heard, he was debriefing at CTU. Why?

23:01.029 --> 23:04.019
The president's hesitating
with this operation,

23:04.119 --> 23:05.940
based on a conversation he had with Bauer.

23:06.034 --> 23:08.110
I wanna to talk to him myself.

23:08.203 --> 23:10.908
Behind the president's back?

23:14.084 --> 23:15.661
That is so dangerous.

23:15.752 --> 23:18.138
If I can get some concrete information,

23:18.538 --> 23:21.091
I can support the
president more effectively.

23:21.174 --> 23:22.752
And if you can't?

23:22.843 --> 23:28.715
Then I'll have the conviction to talk him
through the situation. I'm in the dark.

23:28.807 --> 23:33.101
- I'm not sure.
- Lynne... Lynne, this is my call.

23:33.186 --> 23:38.228
Your recommendation not to go
around the president is duly noted.

23:50.871 --> 23:52.947
Thanks.

23:58.837 --> 24:04.507
Mr Almeida, Mike Novick, the
president's chief of staff, is on the line.

24:07.220 --> 24:12.641
- Mr Novick, this is Tony Almeida.
- Hi, Tony. I need to reach Jack Bauer.

24:12.726 --> 24:15.762
Yeah, well, we're trying
to locate him ourselves, sir.

24:16.563 --> 24:18.805
What do you mean? What's the problem?

24:18.899 --> 24:22.149
Jack was here earlier,
debriefing from the day's events,

24:22.235 --> 24:26.447
when he grabbed a material witness
and took her off the premises illegally.

24:26.531 --> 24:30.196
- He also assaulted CTU personnel.
- Why would he do that?

24:30.285 --> 24:33.986
Jack's working on a hunch
that the Cyprus recording was fabricated.

24:34.080 --> 24:36.832
This is what I wanted to talk to him about.

24:36.917 --> 24:39.586
The president is not giving
his complete support

24:39.669 --> 24:43.619
to the military action
until he hears from Bauer.

24:44.257 --> 24:48.504
- I understand, sir.
- Now, what about the witness he's taken?

24:48.595 --> 24:51.382
- How does that factor in?
- Her name is Kate Warner.

24:51.473 --> 24:54.427
Her sister was involved
with the Second Wave terrorists.

24:54.518 --> 24:55.731
We're trying to connect the dots.

24:55.815 --> 24:58.729
That's the other reason
we need to find Jack.

24:58.814 --> 25:01.534
The second you make contact with Bauer,

25:01.934 --> 25:04.104
you put him through to
me. We're at District.

25:04.194 --> 25:06.270
Yes, sir.

25:15.288 --> 25:16.866
- Turner.
- Carrie.

25:16.957 --> 25:19.792
- What's up?
- Yeah, I need to see you.

25:19.876 --> 25:21.952
Yeah.

25:39.354 --> 25:41.892
Yes, Tony?

25:41.982 --> 25:45.730
- Where are we on Jack?
- His exit wasn't picked up on satellite.

25:45.819 --> 25:50.860
- He hasn't initiated contact with anyone.
- What about Kate Warner?

25:50.949 --> 25:55.410
Her house and her father's company
are being watched, in case they go there.

25:55.495 --> 25:57.571
Good.

25:58.582 --> 26:01.037
Have you talked to Michelle?

26:02.878 --> 26:08.631
Yeah. In fact, I wanted
to talk to you about that.

26:09.301 --> 26:13.168
Do you have a problem working
in the same office with Michelle?

26:13.263 --> 26:16.134
Is that what you think?
That I'd be making up stories

26:16.224 --> 26:19.759
because I have a problem
working with her?

26:20.979 --> 26:24.099
She and Jack were talking
before he took Kate Warner.

26:24.191 --> 26:26.598
They weren't trading recipes.

26:26.693 --> 26:29.101
It was conspiratorial.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.404
All right.

26:43.960 --> 26:48.005
I need you to put a filter on all
of Michelle's communications.

26:48.089 --> 26:51.921
E- mails, phone calls, open channels.

26:52.010 --> 26:56.055
I want you to let me know
when Jack tries to contact her, all right?

26:56.139 --> 26:58.215
Done.

27:21.748 --> 27:23.228
What's going on out there?

27:23.428 --> 27:26.161
They're taking my wife
where she'll be safe.

27:26.253 --> 27:28.329
And then what?

27:35.679 --> 27:40.720
- You're gonna let me go, right?
- Don't push me. You got me into this.

27:40.809 --> 27:45.020
- I didn't get you into this.
- You pointed this gun at me.

27:45.105 --> 27:47.726
That's how this whole thing started.

27:48.650 --> 27:53.277
What were you doing
with a gun anyway? Huh?

27:53.947 --> 27:57.031
What?! Were you gonna rip this place off?

27:57.117 --> 27:59.442
No.

27:59.536 --> 28:02.620
You ruined my life. It's all your fault.

28:03.790 --> 28:06.042
Sorry, I shouldn't never
have taken out that gun.

28:06.156 --> 28:08.666
Yeah? Well, why did you?

28:09.588 --> 28:15.543
- I was afraid.
- Afraid. What do you have to be afraid of?

28:16.303 --> 28:19.054
Answer me!

28:20.474 --> 28:25.551
My daddy died tonight.
The bomb that went off, he was there.

28:46.875 --> 28:47.906
What?

28:48.001 --> 28:51.750
Your wife's on her way to Monterey.
Everything cool in there?

28:51.838 --> 28:56.963
It's not cool. Make sure my wife gets there.
You don't need to call every five minutes.

28:57.052 --> 29:01.513
OK, Ramon, you need to stay calm.
Now, we're doing exactly what you said.

29:01.598 --> 29:04.682
You got to think this through.
You'll be in custody soon.

29:04.768 --> 29:08.552
- I didn't mean to kill anybody!
- We know.

29:08.647 --> 29:13.439
But what would help your case
is if you'd let the young lady out now.

29:13.527 --> 29:17.607
I'm not stupid! She's the only reason
you haven't shot your way in here yet.

29:17.697 --> 29:21.647
And I'll tell you something.
If I see you coming in, I'll kill her!

29:21.743 --> 29:24.032
You better believe that!

29:24.121 --> 29:29.281
You're not a killer, Ramon.
You've got no record. Be smart.

29:29.376 --> 29:31.036
I'll be smart. You be smart.

29:31.795 --> 29:33.455
Damn it!

29:35.924 --> 29:36.955
Get back here!

29:37.759 --> 29:44.129
No! No! Open the door! Open it!
Open the door! Open it!

29:44.224 --> 29:47.759
Help me! Hurry, I'm at the back door!
Help! Please!

29:48.353 --> 29:50.844
I don't wanna hurt you, but I will!

29:51.898 --> 29:54.816
Mr Garcia, what's going on in there?

29:56.736 --> 29:58.859
Oh, my God.

29:58.947 --> 30:01.319
- Mr Garcia, pick up the phone.
- No!

30:01.408 --> 30:02.653
No!

30:05.745 --> 30:08.367
Please respond, Mr Garcia.

30:10.667 --> 30:13.585
Hey. Hey.

30:14.921 --> 30:17.412
Is there anyone else besides you?

30:21.428 --> 30:27.217
- Kate, look the other way.
- No, no. No one else. There's no one else.

30:30.187 --> 30:33.141
- Come on.
- Wait, the warehouse is that way.

30:33.231 --> 30:35.023
- Jack.
- Yeah, go ahead.

30:35.108 --> 30:38.275
I'll approach in a sweep pattern.
It'll take a few minutes.

30:38.361 --> 30:40.437
Copy that.

30:42.741 --> 30:47.569
- They're gonna be five minutes.
- And here we are without a deck of cards.

30:50.248 --> 30:54.542
You know, I was down at Benning
when Samuels tried to recruit you.

30:54.628 --> 30:56.704
Yeah.

30:56.797 --> 31:00.497
He was real disappointed
you turned him down.

31:02.552 --> 31:05.339
He said you were a born killer.

31:07.974 --> 31:10.050
Is that true?

32:10.871 --> 32:13.622
- Turner.
- I got an alarm on the backup server.

32:13.707 --> 32:17.621
- Do you have one?
- No. Must be on your side of the router.

32:17.711 --> 32:19.668
Want me to check the connections?

32:19.754 --> 32:23.088
No, you need C-clearance for that.
I'll have to do it.

32:23.633 --> 32:25.709
Right, I forgot.

32:49.242 --> 32:52.409
- Will you give this to Thomkins for me?
- Sure.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.684
Thank you.

33:24.736 --> 33:28.520
- Mr President, may I?
- What is it, Mike?

33:30.367 --> 33:36.370
Jack Bauer took a material witness from CTU
and assaulted an agent in the process.

33:36.832 --> 33:39.667
I know how much this country
owes him, sir,

33:39.751 --> 33:43.203
but he's obviously suffered
some kind of emotional collapse.

33:43.296 --> 33:47.460
It would be understandable,
given everything he's been through.

33:47.551 --> 33:49.958
But we don't know that.

33:50.053 --> 33:53.588
What he did might have been necessary
under the circumstances.

33:54.641 --> 33:57.927
We already have incontrovertible
proof from Langley

33:58.019 --> 34:00.689
that the Cyprus recording is authentic.

34:00.772 --> 34:03.559
Finding Jack Bauer
isn't going to change that.

34:03.650 --> 34:09.071
The country needs your energy and attention
on what happens after those bombs drop.

34:09.156 --> 34:11.563
We need to prepare for this war.

34:12.033 --> 34:19.163
If this recording's not authentic,
and Jack Bauer turns out to be right,

34:19.248 --> 34:21.621
it'd be a mistake of historic proportions.

34:21.710 --> 34:24.415
- Mr President...
- That's all, Mike.

34:26.590 --> 34:28.795
Find Jack Bauer.

34:42.022 --> 34:45.521
She'll be here any minute.
Where's the evidence?

34:45.609 --> 34:47.685
OK, here's how it's gonna go down.

34:48.612 --> 34:53.652
I take Kate with me. She sets up the plane.
It picks us up at an airport of my choosing.

34:53.742 --> 34:55.070
When I'm on that plane,

34:55.170 --> 34:57.277
I'll call and tell you
where the evidence is.

34:57.370 --> 35:00.122
What assurances do I have you'll even call?

35:00.207 --> 35:04.584
None. It's one of those things
where you're just gonna have to trust me.

35:05.045 --> 35:07.536
Well, I don't.

35:09.257 --> 35:13.635
Jack, you're the last person in the world
I want tracking me down.

35:24.773 --> 35:28.984
- Jack, what's going on?
- You and I are going on a little trip.

35:30.904 --> 35:32.980
Jack?

35:36.910 --> 35:38.986
You have to go with him.

35:39.079 --> 35:42.033
- What about you?
- Jack's not coming.

35:49.798 --> 35:52.371
You gave me your word.

35:52.467 --> 35:54.626
I'm sorry it has to be done like this.

35:58.098 --> 35:59.212
Let go of me.

35:59.307 --> 36:04.016
Talk to her, Jack. Otherwise,
I'm gonna have to do this differently.

36:04.104 --> 36:07.603
Kate, remember everything
I said to you in the car.

36:08.608 --> 36:12.476
Do what he says, and I promise you,
you will not get hurt.

36:15.157 --> 36:17.233
You're giving me up, aren't you?

36:43.643 --> 36:47.890
- CTU, Dessler.
- Hey. Hey, it's me.

36:47.981 --> 36:49.715
Danny, what are you doing up?

36:49.915 --> 36:52.726
I can't sleep. Are
you sure it's safe here?

36:52.819 --> 36:54.527
Yeah. As far as I know, it is.

36:54.613 --> 36:59.073
As far as you know? What the hell
does that mean? "As far as I know"?

36:59.159 --> 37:00.902
Danny, you know my situation.

37:00.994 --> 37:03.567
You know what, your situation sucks.

37:03.663 --> 37:07.744
You're talking about my life. The least
you could do is tell me what you know.

37:07.834 --> 37:10.206
There's nothing to know.
Stay where you are.

37:10.295 --> 37:13.629
- I'll come over tomorrow.
- Don't you patronise me!

37:13.715 --> 37:17.665
Don't you patronise me, cos I want answers.
A nuclear bomb just went off.

37:17.761 --> 37:20.928
I wanna know if it's safe
to stay here in LA.

37:21.014 --> 37:23.470
What about the kids?
Don't you care about them?

37:23.558 --> 37:26.512
Of course. If there was anything
to know, I'd tell you.

37:26.603 --> 37:30.553
Is that right? You didn't tell me
about the bomb. Did it slip your mind?

37:30.649 --> 37:34.349
I already explained it to you.
I wasn't allowed to tell anyone.

37:34.444 --> 37:38.905
You know what? Maybe I should
call Carrie. She'd tell me.

37:38.990 --> 37:42.324
- I thought you weren't speaking.
- We're not. She's a bitch.

37:42.410 --> 37:45.530
- Danny, I will take care...
- Forget it.

38:18.822 --> 38:22.902
Don't shoot me!

38:22.993 --> 38:27.121
Please! I'm sorry!

38:27.873 --> 38:30.364
Throw the weapon out the front door,

38:30.459 --> 38:33.329
and come out with your hands
behind your head.

38:33.420 --> 38:36.374
No! I need more time!

38:39.259 --> 38:42.046
My wife's gonna be safe, right?

38:42.637 --> 38:48.142
Come on, Ramon, you gotta cooperate
now. You got nobody left in there.

38:55.108 --> 38:57.778
Anybody have a visual on the suspect?

38:57.861 --> 39:00.150
No. Should we hold position?

39:00.238 --> 39:04.817
No. Ever since the bomb, we got a new call
every ten minutes. We gotta be done here.

39:04.910 --> 39:07.911
Please don't. Give him time.
He'll come out on his own.

39:07.996 --> 39:10.701
All right, all units go. Go now, go!

39:12.667 --> 39:14.743
Drop your weapon!

39:14.836 --> 39:16.117
No.

39:19.883 --> 39:22.552
Code 4. Send medical...

39:22.636 --> 39:24.759
Medical team, go!

39:33.146 --> 39:35.222
- Thank you.
- All right.

39:35.315 --> 39:38.850
- We ready?
- Yes, we are, Mike.

39:41.988 --> 39:44.562
Mr Vice President,
you're on with me and Lynne

39:44.658 --> 39:47.908
because the president
is being briefed by Ryan Chappelle.

39:47.994 --> 39:50.117
He asked that we go ahead without him.

39:50.914 --> 39:54.532
- Fine.
- How did it go with the British ambassador?

39:54.626 --> 39:59.122
Not well. He knows that we're planning
a retaliation against the Middle East,

39:59.214 --> 40:02.131
but he's frustrated cos
we're not coordinating with them.

40:02.217 --> 40:04.922
I'm sure he'll understand
once he gets the facts.

40:05.011 --> 40:07.419
What are the facts, Mike?

40:07.514 --> 40:10.965
We've got planes in the air.
Either we're committed or we're not.

40:11.059 --> 40:16.932
If the evidence shows
that the Cyprus recording was falsified,

40:17.023 --> 40:21.152
the president wants the option
of calling those planes back.

40:21.236 --> 40:25.281
You know what it sounds like to me?
An excuse to call this off.

40:31.121 --> 40:36.791
Do you believe the president's capable
of doing the hard thing, Mike?

40:38.837 --> 40:41.209
The right thing?

40:44.384 --> 40:46.875
Yes, sir, I do.

40:46.970 --> 40:49.140
He's committed to this action.

40:49.340 --> 40:52.759
All he's doing is making
sure every base is covered.

40:54.728 --> 40:56.886
I hope so.

40:57.856 --> 41:02.434
The president will be contacting you
as soon as anything develops.

41:02.527 --> 41:04.935
All right, Mike.

41:16.750 --> 41:19.323
Mike.

41:22.923 --> 41:25.793
You think the vice president
is right, don't you?

41:27.844 --> 41:30.845
If the president turns those planes around,

41:30.931 --> 41:35.474
based on the unconfirmed speculation
of a single CTU agent,

41:36.853 --> 41:39.640
it'll be a disaster.

41:47.572 --> 41:49.648
So what do we do about it?

41:54.037 --> 41:56.113
I don't know.

42:05.799 --> 42:08.468
- Where are you taking me?
- Get in.

42:09.928 --> 42:12.466
I'm not gonna try and escape.

42:14.141 --> 42:15.273
I said, get in.

42:15.373 --> 42:19.515
Kate.
Get in the trunk, for your own safety.

43:03.565 --> 43:06.069
The tracker's in place.
It's been activated.

43:06.169 --> 43:06.851
Good.

43:07.736 --> 43:10.772
Jack, it's been a real pleasure.

43:13.408 --> 43:15.531
I'll be in touch.

43:16.305 --> 43:22.932
