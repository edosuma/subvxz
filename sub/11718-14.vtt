Schedule starts us in Waimalu.

00:34.149 --> 00:35.265
Looks like
we got about

00:35.350 --> 00:37.835
12 stops, and then,
onto Mililani.

00:37.902 --> 00:39.353
Don't forget,
you're driving solo next week.

I'm taking the wife to
the ninth island-- Vegas.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.907
It's our twenty-fifth.

00:43.992 --> 00:46.910
Brah, 25 years
with the same woman.

00:46.995 --> 00:48.245
I have a hard enough

00:48.329 --> 00:50.164
time committing to new slippers.

00:50.231 --> 00:51.565
One of the advantages
to being married?

00:52.567 --> 00:53.500
The wife makes
all the decisions.

00:59.740 --> 01:01.741
Somebody's in a rush.

01:08.099 --> 01:09.299
Look out!

01:10.185 --> 01:10.801
Oh!

01:18.193 --> 01:21.145
Driver, take the keys out
of the ignition

01:21.229 --> 01:23.230
and throw them out the window!

01:28.203 --> 01:29.536
Just stay calm.
It'll be all right.

01:38.546 --> 01:39.830
Don't do it.

01:41.949 --> 01:43.517
Keep driving! Go!

01:52.811 --> 01:54.394
Aah! Carl?

01:56.648 --> 01:58.182
You okay?

01:58.266 --> 01:59.833
Hey!

01:59.901 --> 02:01.568

Hey, I just saw
Uncle Joe leaving.

02:48.316 --> 02:51.068
What's going on?

02:55.807 --> 02:57.241
Sit down, son.

02:57.325 --> 02:58.692
We need to talk.

03:06.301 --> 03:10.571
I'm sending you and your sister
back to the mainland.

03:10.638 --> 03:12.139
You're leaving
tomorrow.

03:12.206 --> 03:13.974
What?

03:14.041 --> 03:16.310
Joe got you into the
Army and Navy Academy.

03:16.377 --> 03:18.312
Mary's going to
stay with Aunt Deb,

03:18.379 --> 03:21.315
so you guys will only be a few
hours away from each other.

03:21.382 --> 03:23.317
I just started junior year.

03:23.384 --> 03:25.552
Why are you doing this?

03:25.603 --> 03:27.070
It's not safe

03:27.155 --> 03:29.273
for you here anymore.

03:29.357 --> 03:31.491
You have to go now.

03:32.527 --> 03:34.244
You're going to stay?

03:34.329 --> 03:36.413
I can't leave.

03:36.497 --> 03:38.498
I still have work to do here.

03:39.534 --> 03:41.451
You know what?

03:41.536 --> 03:43.120
Mom would have never
sent us away.

03:43.204 --> 03:44.671
Yeah, well, your mother is gone.

03:44.739 --> 03:46.173
Okay?

03:46.240 --> 03:49.176
Now it's just me.

03:53.748 --> 03:56.082
Listen, I...

03:58.269 --> 04:00.554
Steve, in-in...
in a couple of years,

04:00.605 --> 04:02.689
you're gonna be 18.

04:02.757 --> 04:04.691
And pretty soon,
you're gonna need

04:04.759 --> 04:07.027
to decide what
kind of man you are.

04:07.094 --> 04:08.762
What kind of man are you?

04:10.531 --> 04:12.316
Breaking up our family.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.786
I'm the kind of man that can't
walk away from a fight.

04:15.870 --> 04:18.822
My first responsibility
is <i>not</i> my safety.

04:18.906 --> 04:20.457
It's yours.

04:20.541 --> 04:22.542
Now, you don't
have to like it.

04:24.445 --> 04:26.747
I just hope someday
you're gonna understand.

04:29.283 --> 04:31.284
Steve...

04:36.341 --> 04:38.958
...you may not hear
from me for a while.

04:39.978 --> 04:41.845
If anything happens,

04:41.929 --> 04:45.565
you can always trust
your Uncle Joe.

05:18.099 --> 05:20.017
I made you three blocks ago.

05:20.101 --> 05:22.035
Why are you following me?

05:22.103 --> 05:23.720
I can help you
find Shelburne.

05:23.805 --> 05:26.723
No, you can't.

05:26.808 --> 05:28.608
You're not going to last long
by yourself.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.477
Yakuza has got a price
on your head.

05:30.528 --> 05:32.446
You expected me to run and hide?

05:32.513 --> 05:34.448
You know what, Joe?
You're stubborn, okay?

05:34.515 --> 05:35.649
But you're not stupid.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.284
Adam Noshimuri thinks
you killed his father.

05:37.351 --> 05:39.870
As long as he believes that,
you're a target.

05:39.954 --> 05:41.204
Go home, son.

05:41.289 --> 05:42.989
Listen to me.

05:43.041 --> 05:44.624
You got to tell Adam
his father's alive.

05:44.692 --> 05:47.994
The last time we spoke,
you made it clear

05:48.046 --> 05:49.713
I'm not your commanding
officer anymore.

05:49.781 --> 05:52.516
So, the way I see it,
you don't take orders from me,

05:52.583 --> 05:53.917
I don't take orders from you.

05:55.803 --> 05:57.804
Better get that.

06:02.844 --> 06:04.628
McGarrett.

06:10.518 --> 06:12.652
Chin, what do we got?

06:12.720 --> 06:15.021
Delivery truck for Trans
Hawaiian Parcel got hit.

06:15.073 --> 06:16.440
Two employees inside.

06:16.507 --> 06:18.325
One's dead, the other's
been treated for injuries.

06:18.392 --> 06:19.476
Okay, we get his statement?

06:19.544 --> 06:20.894
Uh, Danny's
talking to him now.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.162
We also got
a witness.

06:22.229 --> 06:23.447
This is the guy
who called it in.

06:23.531 --> 06:24.664
Says he was driving
by and caught

06:24.732 --> 06:26.583
the tail end of
the hijacking.

06:26.667 --> 06:28.585
Saw two men in masks,
armed with semi-autos.

06:28.653 --> 06:30.787
One guy was coming out
the back of the truck.

06:30.872 --> 06:31.955
We know what they stole?

06:32.039 --> 06:33.123
Kono's taking
an inventory.

06:33.207 --> 06:34.291
I'll see
where she's at.

06:34.375 --> 06:35.709
How long the whole thing last?

06:35.760 --> 06:36.960
Seconds?
Minutes?

06:37.044 --> 06:38.378
Under a minute.

06:38.429 --> 06:39.596
For sure.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.048
Not a lot of time
to steal stuff. Um,

06:42.116 --> 06:44.684
Lee, this is Commander
Steve McGarrett.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.136
Do you know what
the hijackers stole?

06:46.220 --> 06:48.755
No. I stayed with Carl
until the police showed up.

06:48.806 --> 06:51.358
And I never went back
to check the cargo.

06:51.425 --> 06:54.144
This is all my fault.

06:54.228 --> 06:55.445
Why are you saying that?

06:55.530 --> 06:57.314
I reached for the radio.

06:57.398 --> 06:59.149
If I had just listened to Carl,

06:59.233 --> 07:01.234
then he'd still
be alive right now.

07:03.070 --> 07:04.955
All right, just relax.

07:05.039 --> 07:07.290
If there's anything else you can
think of, even if it's small--

07:07.375 --> 07:09.042
you have my card--
please give us a call.

07:12.630 --> 07:13.747
Okay, these
guys were pros.

07:13.798 --> 07:14.798
They knew exactly
what they wanted.

07:14.882 --> 07:16.800
They were in and
out very quickly.

07:16.868 --> 07:18.451
Question is,
what was on this truck

07:18.503 --> 07:19.603
that was worth killing for?

07:19.670 --> 07:21.004
What's up?

07:21.088 --> 07:22.172
Wait till you hear this.

07:22.256 --> 07:23.456
According
to the manifest,

07:23.508 --> 07:25.509
there were 73 packages aboard.

07:25.593 --> 07:27.511
- Okay, so what's missing?
- That's the thing.

07:27.595 --> 07:28.678
We just did a count,

07:28.763 --> 07:30.597
and all 73 packages are present
and accounted for.

07:30.648 --> 07:32.015
So, you're saying
they didn't take anything?

07:32.099 --> 07:33.266
- Yeah.
- Now wait a second.

07:33.317 --> 07:34.568
If this wasn't a robbery,

07:34.635 --> 07:36.069
what was it about?

07:47.713 --> 07:48.514
<i>Hey, I just got off the phone</i>

07:48.515 --> 07:50.333
with the shipping
company. They confirmed

07:50.401 --> 07:52.618
- that the manifest was accurate.
- Okay.

07:52.686 --> 07:54.854
So either the hijackers
got scared and bailed,

07:54.921 --> 07:57.156
or whatever they were
looking for wasn't in here.

07:57.224 --> 07:59.192
Well, there certainly were
plenty of ripe targets on board.

07:59.259 --> 08:01.144
Yeah? It's not the only thing
they left behind.

08:01.228 --> 08:03.196
Check this out.

08:06.116 --> 08:08.934
The print Kono found came back

08:08.986 --> 08:10.536
to our delivery driver,
Lee Dolan.

08:10.604 --> 08:12.288
The blood matches
our victim, Carl Hodge.

08:12.373 --> 08:13.456
Wait a second.

08:13.540 --> 08:14.874
Carl was killed instantly.

08:14.941 --> 08:16.159
I mean, the
only way

08:16.243 --> 08:17.577
his blood could have gotten back

08:17.628 --> 08:19.462
into the cargo hold is
if Lee transferred it

08:19.546 --> 08:20.630
incidentally after the attack.

08:20.714 --> 08:22.548
But Lee told you
he stayed with Carl's body

08:22.616 --> 08:24.334
until the ambulance arrived.

08:24.418 --> 08:26.886
Yeah, he did. Lee lied. He
went to the back of the truck.

08:26.953 --> 08:29.222
All right, so what's he hiding?

08:39.767 --> 08:41.818
This is unbelievable.

08:41.902 --> 08:43.469
Okay, this guy drives
a truck for a living,

08:43.520 --> 08:44.804
and he owns a house like this.

08:44.855 --> 08:46.572
I can't even find
an affordable place to rent.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.157
- You understand?
- Yeah.

08:48.242 --> 08:50.860
I'm thinking that Lee has found
a way to supplement his income.

08:50.944 --> 08:52.245
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

08:52.312 --> 08:53.446
You hear that?

08:53.497 --> 08:56.666
Oh, are we doing
a thing right now?

08:56.750 --> 08:57.617
What are you talking about,
a thing?

08:57.668 --> 08:58.918
A thing, like we pretend

08:58.985 --> 09:00.620
to hear something, which
justifies us entering

09:00.671 --> 09:02.121
the premises without a warrant,
that kind of thing.

09:02.172 --> 09:03.155
'Cause I do not hear...

09:03.207 --> 09:04.207
- I said shut up!
- That I heard.

09:16.103 --> 09:17.353
Get down!

09:17.438 --> 09:19.639
A little help
here, Steve!

09:38.709 --> 09:40.293
Talk.

09:40.360 --> 09:41.577
Talk.
Guy was crazy.

09:41.662 --> 09:43.746
All right, he came in here
looking for some package

09:43.814 --> 09:45.965
that he said was stolen
from the truck.

09:46.032 --> 09:48.084
And for some reason, he thought I had it.
All right, listen to me.

09:48.168 --> 09:49.552
We spoke to your
shipping company, okay?

09:49.636 --> 09:51.220
Every package that was
supposed to be delivered today

09:51.305 --> 09:52.972
is accounted for,
okay, so either

09:53.039 --> 09:55.308
we are dealing with a package
that does not exist,

09:55.375 --> 09:57.209
or there's something
you are not telling us.

10:01.932 --> 10:04.517
A while back, these guys
approached me with an offer.

10:04.568 --> 10:05.985
All right, they needed someone

10:06.053 --> 10:08.354
at the airport who could get
their shipments past customs.

10:08.405 --> 10:10.239
- What kind of shipments?
- I don't know.

10:10.324 --> 10:11.991
All right, they give me
the waybill number

10:12.058 --> 10:13.242
for the packages that come in.

10:13.327 --> 10:14.577
I stash it on the truck,

10:14.661 --> 10:17.079
and then, I hand it off between
scheduled stops, all right?

10:17.164 --> 10:18.915
But before
I could make today's delivery,

10:18.999 --> 10:20.249
the hijackers boosted it.

10:20.334 --> 10:22.368
Explains why the stolen package
wasn't on the manifest.

10:22.419 --> 10:23.536
It wasn't even supposed

10:23.587 --> 10:25.421
to be on the truck
in the first place, right?

10:25.506 --> 10:27.206
Brah, I don't know
who hit the shipment.

10:27.257 --> 10:28.291
Yeah, but you know
who hired you, okay?

10:28.375 --> 10:29.759
Listen to me.
You lead us to them,

10:29.843 --> 10:31.093
we work out
what was in the package.

10:31.178 --> 10:32.261
Then maybe we can figure out

10:32.346 --> 10:34.297
who else would
want it. Get it?

10:34.381 --> 10:36.098
Yeah. There's only
one problem with that.

10:36.183 --> 10:38.551
- I only ever dealt with one guy.
- Okay, who was the guy?

10:42.723 --> 10:44.190
This guy?

10:44.257 --> 10:45.525
That is a problem.

10:47.427 --> 10:49.695
This day keeps getting better.

10:50.948 --> 10:52.064
Hi, Rachel.

10:52.115 --> 10:53.399
Oh.

10:53.450 --> 10:55.451
What?

10:55.536 --> 10:57.436
Can't believe the baby's coming
this early, Danny.

10:57.488 --> 10:58.821
Well, must take after Stan,

10:58.906 --> 11:00.156
because you are late
for everything.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.491
Did he get a flight yet?

11:01.575 --> 11:02.758
Yes, but it only
leaves tonight.

11:02.826 --> 11:04.160
It's 16 hours
from Beijing.

11:04.228 --> 11:05.912
Let's hope the labor
doesn't take that long.

11:05.963 --> 11:07.163
Oh, Grace.

11:07.247 --> 11:08.464
Did you...?
- Grace is fine.

11:08.549 --> 11:09.966
Hey, listen to me.
The nanny's picking her up.

11:10.050 --> 11:11.501
She's bringing her here.
It's going to be beautiful.

11:11.585 --> 11:12.552
You're beautiful. Breathe.

11:12.619 --> 11:13.970
Okay. Hi.

11:14.054 --> 11:15.905
Rachel Edwards.
We called from the car.

11:15.973 --> 11:17.890
Yes. We just need you
to sign her in.

11:17.958 --> 11:19.725
Okay.
There you go.

11:19.793 --> 11:21.177
- All right. Yeah.
- Right there.

11:21.261 --> 11:22.929
Danny, you didn't have
to do this.

11:22.980 --> 11:24.931
Sure, I did.

11:27.234 --> 11:28.918
<i>I got your text.</i>

11:28.986 --> 11:30.052
Any word
from Danny?

11:30.120 --> 11:31.554
No. He said he's
going to call back

11:31.622 --> 11:32.788
once he gets some news.

11:32.856 --> 11:34.156
- Hey.
- Hey. So we identified

11:34.241 --> 11:35.358
Lee's contact in the
smuggling operation.

11:35.442 --> 11:36.726
Name is Kyle Ferris.

11:36.793 --> 11:38.661
Yeah, unfortunately,
Kyle's last arrest

11:38.745 --> 11:41.247
was in '08
for an airport cargo heist.

11:41.314 --> 11:42.932
The Feds
believed the job

11:43.000 --> 11:45.184
was masterminded by this guy,
Nicky Chang.

11:45.252 --> 11:46.686
Okay. Has Nicky Chang

11:46.753 --> 11:47.753
ever been indicted?

11:47.821 --> 11:48.871
No. Feds couldn't
make a case.

11:48.956 --> 11:50.289
I mean, he's sneaky--
no one can get him

11:50.340 --> 11:51.624
in the same room as his stash.

11:51.675 --> 11:53.125
Which is saying
something,

11:53.176 --> 11:54.827
because, according to HPD,
Nicky Chang

11:54.878 --> 11:56.045
practically runs
Hawaii's black market.

11:56.129 --> 11:57.763
Only now he's using

11:57.831 --> 11:58.798
delivery drivers to smuggle

11:58.849 --> 12:00.216
his contraband
through the airport.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.500
Well, maybe Nicky Chang
can tell us

12:01.552 --> 12:02.969
who would want
to steal from him.

12:03.020 --> 12:04.437
Word on Chang is, he's
notoriously paranoid.

12:04.504 --> 12:05.671
Keeps really tight security.

12:05.722 --> 12:07.306
Only takes meetings
with people he trusts.

12:07.357 --> 12:08.808
Well, luckily
for us,

12:08.859 --> 12:10.026
we might know someone
who can make

12:10.110 --> 12:11.510
an introduction.

12:12.529 --> 12:14.697
Holy mullet. Who's this guy?

12:14.781 --> 12:17.033
The name's Sang Min.
First case Five-O ever worked,

12:17.117 --> 12:19.652
we, uh, busted him for running
a human trafficking ring.

12:19.703 --> 12:20.736
Oh, he sounds like a charmer.

12:20.804 --> 12:22.021
I mean, Sang Min's

12:22.072 --> 12:23.956
a bad guy-- that's for
sure-- but he's also

12:24.024 --> 12:25.908
opportunistic and
he has deep ties

12:25.993 --> 12:27.043
to the island's black market.

12:27.127 --> 12:28.193
We offer the
right incentive,

12:28.245 --> 12:29.662
maybe he takes us
to Nicky Chang.

12:29.713 --> 12:31.196
I'll go make the call.
Okay.

12:32.332 --> 12:33.849
- Steve.
- Yeah.

12:33.917 --> 12:35.585
So I ran that address.

12:35.669 --> 12:37.803
That business you saw Joe
snooping around this morning?

12:37.871 --> 12:39.972
- Yeah.
- It's an antique shop.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.757
It's run by a guy
named Richard Detweiller.

12:41.842 --> 12:43.309
He's got no record.

12:43.376 --> 12:44.927
Business looks clean.

12:45.012 --> 12:47.063
What do you think Joe
was doing there?

12:47.147 --> 12:49.381
I don't know, man.

12:49.433 --> 12:52.318
Tell you something--
he wasn't buying antiques.

13:11.705 --> 13:13.089
Hey, hey, hey!
Get down! Get down!

13:25.852 --> 13:27.687
Are you okay?

13:42.031 --> 13:43.219
<i>Joe, what happened?</i>

13:43.220 --> 13:45.621
I didn't think Adam Noshimuri
would take it this far.

13:45.706 --> 13:46.906
Really?

13:46.957 --> 13:48.624
I mean, it's the Yakuza, Joe.

13:48.709 --> 13:50.159
They don't play
by any rule book.

13:50.244 --> 13:51.461
Innocent people could have died.

13:51.545 --> 13:53.129
I know.

13:53.213 --> 13:55.465
Okay.
Here's what's going to happen.

13:55.549 --> 13:57.083
Okay, the investigating
officer, he's going to come,

13:57.134 --> 13:58.384
he's going to
take a statement.

13:58.452 --> 14:00.219
He's going to place you
in protective custody.

14:00.287 --> 14:02.338
Steve...
Hey, hey! No arguments, Joe!

14:02.423 --> 14:03.890
All right? Until
I figure out

14:03.957 --> 14:05.758
a way to get the Yakuza
off your back,

14:05.809 --> 14:06.792
you're staying right here.

14:06.844 --> 14:08.227
We tried it your way.

14:08.295 --> 14:10.413
Now we're doing it my way.

14:18.805 --> 14:20.606
Oh, look at this.

14:20.657 --> 14:22.525
Sweet and Spicy, huh?

14:24.611 --> 14:26.779
Lori Weston,
meet Sang Min.

14:26.830 --> 14:28.998
So, ladies, to what
do I owe the pleasure?

14:29.082 --> 14:30.082
You know
Nicky Chang?

14:30.150 --> 14:31.751
Yeah, sure.
Boy came up under me.

14:31.818 --> 14:33.920
- Taught him everything I know.
- Oh, yeah? Where was that?

14:33.987 --> 14:36.372
The Vidal Sassoon
School for Bad Guys?

14:36.457 --> 14:38.674
And I thought
you were the sweet one, huh?

14:38.759 --> 14:40.042
I can be.

14:40.127 --> 14:43.262
I'm here to offer you
a pretty sweet deal.

14:43.330 --> 14:45.214
I read your jacket.
Pretty good read.

14:45.299 --> 14:46.849
Between lighting
your cell on fire

14:46.934 --> 14:48.100
and starting
two riots,

14:48.168 --> 14:50.136
no wonder you landed
your ass in solitary.

14:50.187 --> 14:51.471
What if we
could improve

14:51.522 --> 14:53.139
your living situation for you?

14:54.224 --> 14:57.143
I'm in solitary
because I want to be.

14:57.194 --> 14:58.811
Wo Fat took out Hess
and that governor lady.

14:58.862 --> 15:00.396
I'm not going to be next.
You feel me?

15:00.481 --> 15:02.315
Okay, we get it, we get it.

15:02.366 --> 15:03.449
You're laying
low in lockdown.

15:03.517 --> 15:04.867
But what if we're
not just talking

15:04.952 --> 15:06.235
about putting you back
in general pop?

15:06.320 --> 15:07.370
You give us
Nicky Chang,

15:07.454 --> 15:08.488
we get you transferred

15:08.539 --> 15:10.206
to a federal prison
on the mainland.

15:10.290 --> 15:12.825
You serve out your sentence
under an assumed name.

15:12.876 --> 15:14.994
Better food,
better facilities,

15:15.045 --> 15:16.412
and you'll be doing time
with a bunch

15:16.497 --> 15:17.580
of white-bread tax evaders.

15:17.664 --> 15:20.099
Club Fed, huh?

15:20.167 --> 15:21.667
And all
I got to do

15:21.718 --> 15:23.336
is roll on my boy Nicky?

15:25.589 --> 15:27.373
Sure, okay.

15:27.424 --> 15:30.793
But there's one other thing
you got to do for me.

15:30.861 --> 15:32.311
What's that?
I've been locked up

15:32.379 --> 15:33.930
for 18 months.

15:34.014 --> 15:35.932
I got certain needs
to attend to.

15:36.016 --> 15:37.350
You feel me?

15:43.607 --> 15:45.858
God, that's
three plates already.

15:45.909 --> 15:47.109
Where does he put it all?

15:47.194 --> 15:48.578
I think I'll go with

15:48.645 --> 15:50.396
the garlic scampi
this time, huh?

15:51.865 --> 15:53.899
Deal's a deal.

15:53.951 --> 15:56.068
Let's go!
I got this one.

15:56.119 --> 15:58.504
And bring me
some more hot sauce.

15:58.572 --> 16:00.906
'Cause you know
I like it spicy, huh?

16:00.958 --> 16:03.075
Seriously,
you need some new material.

16:03.126 --> 16:04.427
What's going on?

16:04.511 --> 16:06.846
Sang Min just put in the call
to Nicky's people.

16:06.913 --> 16:08.273
They're going to call back
with details for the meet.

16:08.298 --> 16:09.131
All right.

16:09.132 --> 16:11.717
Hey, it was just open
a second ago.

16:11.768 --> 16:14.554
♪

16:14.605 --> 16:16.639
There he is.

16:22.596 --> 16:23.946
Hey.

16:24.031 --> 16:25.781
- Howzit, crime fighters?
- Pretty good.

16:25.866 --> 16:28.117
You, uh... you own
a shrimp truck,

16:28.201 --> 16:29.935
but you're bringing lunch
to work.

16:29.987 --> 16:32.271
Trying to eat smarter, bruddah.

16:32.322 --> 16:33.772
Shrimp-- perfectly healthy.

16:33.824 --> 16:35.541
Not the way I make them.

16:35.609 --> 16:38.127
But this Subway sandwich--
so <i>ono.</i>

16:38.211 --> 16:39.795
Okay, so you're eating these
to lose weight?

16:39.880 --> 16:41.113
Is that... is that right?

16:41.164 --> 16:43.966
It worked for Jared,
and that boy was large.

16:44.051 --> 16:45.551
But the best
thing about it--

16:45.619 --> 16:47.470
they make it
any way you want it.

16:47.554 --> 16:49.088
Check this one.

16:49.139 --> 16:51.474
The Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki

16:51.558 --> 16:53.726
with jalapeños
and banana peppers.

16:53.793 --> 16:55.595
Now, you put that
with this,

16:55.646 --> 16:57.930
a turkey BLT-- bam!--

16:57.981 --> 17:01.601
that's some serious
culinary fusion.

17:01.652 --> 17:03.986
So how many of these did you order?
Five.

17:04.070 --> 17:05.605
Five foot-longs?

17:05.656 --> 17:07.490
It was a good deal.

17:07.574 --> 17:08.807
And I got breakfast
for tomorrow.

17:08.858 --> 17:10.992
Okay, I'm not judging, but...

17:11.078 --> 17:12.144
we need to rethink

17:12.194 --> 17:13.695
this whole weight loss strategy.

17:15.248 --> 17:17.316
Hey, ladies.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.335
Need a tour guide?

17:21.755 --> 17:23.789
This is cruel and unusual
punishment, huh?

17:23.839 --> 17:25.090
Yeah.

17:25.157 --> 17:26.842
I'd say it's more of a crime
against fashion,

17:26.926 --> 17:28.344
but we'll let you
skate on that charge.

17:28.428 --> 17:29.762
Besides, you wouldn't want
to be spotted lunching

17:29.829 --> 17:31.380
with cops, now,
would you?

17:32.432 --> 17:33.849
Sang Min.

17:37.270 --> 17:38.337
McGarrett.

17:45.362 --> 17:47.313
I'm sorry.
I know you want to do

17:47.364 --> 17:49.014
the whole dramatic
stare-down thing,

17:49.066 --> 17:51.534
but I-I can't take you seriously
in this getup,

17:51.618 --> 17:53.319
buddy.

17:56.406 --> 17:58.824
Hey. Nicky's calling back.

18:01.211 --> 18:02.878
<i>Ni hao.</i>

18:04.247 --> 18:06.382
Okay. See you soon.

18:08.085 --> 18:10.036
- What'd he say?
- Iwilei and Kuwili-- one hour.

18:10.103 --> 18:12.338
He's sending some boys to
pick me up and take me to him.

18:12.389 --> 18:13.839
All right, perfect.
We're going to wire you up.

18:13.890 --> 18:15.007
We'll follow a safe
distance behind.

18:15.058 --> 18:17.143
As soon as Nicky gives
us the info, we move in.

18:17.210 --> 18:19.512
I ain't going in there alone.
No way.

18:19.563 --> 18:21.013
What are you talking about?

18:21.064 --> 18:23.065
We had the DA's office put out
word that your case fell apart.

18:23.150 --> 18:24.316
Nicky has no reason
to suspect anything.

18:24.384 --> 18:25.685
It's going to be fine.

18:25.736 --> 18:27.553
We'll be right out front
in case anything happens.

18:28.689 --> 18:30.239
Hey, you don't get it,
do you, huh?

18:30.323 --> 18:31.240
No legit gangster

18:31.324 --> 18:33.359
walks into a meet
without some muscle.

18:33.410 --> 18:35.995
I show up solo, and Nicky
will know something's up.

18:36.062 --> 18:37.496
So what, you're asking
for a bodyguard?

18:37.564 --> 18:39.198
Yeah, that's right,
I want a bodyguard, and it ain't

18:39.249 --> 18:40.416
going to be
any of you,

18:40.500 --> 18:42.151
'cause Nicky knows
every cop on the island.

18:42.219 --> 18:45.421
Look, if we're going to do this,
if we're going to sell this,

18:45.505 --> 18:48.874
it has to be a legit local
with ties to some bad guys, huh?

18:48.925 --> 18:52.411
Yo. You need anything else?

18:55.582 --> 18:57.583
Oh, you got to be kidding me!
Not him!

18:57.634 --> 18:59.852
- Shh.
<i>- What happened to you, guy?</i>

18:59.919 --> 19:00.936
You used to be hard.

19:01.021 --> 19:02.605
Now you've gone soft
in more ways than one.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.474
I'm a legit tycoon.

19:05.559 --> 19:08.444
It's what they call
a pillar in the community.

19:08.528 --> 19:11.230
I got certain civic duties
I'm obliged to fulfill.

19:11.281 --> 19:13.149
Snitching ain't a civic duty.

19:13.233 --> 19:14.433
Hey. I ain't
no snitch.

19:14.484 --> 19:16.118
I ain't the one rolling up

19:16.203 --> 19:18.287
in my homeboy's crib
all wired up.

19:18.371 --> 19:20.573
I guess that makes
you a snitch.

19:20.624 --> 19:21.741
You're the wrong guy
for this job.

19:21.792 --> 19:23.209
You better be cool, huh?

19:23.276 --> 19:24.627
They're going
to kill each other before we even

19:24.711 --> 19:26.579
get them in play.

19:26.630 --> 19:28.164
I don't feel good about this.

19:28.248 --> 19:29.248
I'm already sweating.

19:29.299 --> 19:31.217
You sure this is a good idea?

19:31.284 --> 19:32.551
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:32.619 --> 19:34.386
We've, uh...
we've sprung Sang Min before

19:34.454 --> 19:35.721
to help with a case.

19:35.789 --> 19:37.089
Yeah? How'd that go?

19:37.140 --> 19:38.390
Well, he escaped custody,

19:38.458 --> 19:40.426
and, uh, he went on the lam
for a couple months,

19:40.477 --> 19:42.061
but we... we recaptured him.

19:42.128 --> 19:43.062
Uh, technically,

19:43.129 --> 19:44.129
he surrendered himself.

19:44.181 --> 19:45.598
Look, just, everybody, relax.

19:45.649 --> 19:47.483
Okay? It's going to be fine.

19:51.905 --> 19:53.439
Hey. Heads up.

19:53.507 --> 19:56.192
Looks like Nicky's guys
just showed.

20:03.083 --> 20:05.150
Good job hiding the wire.

20:05.202 --> 20:06.669
Where did you place it, boss?

20:06.753 --> 20:08.704
Well, put it this way--
once we're done, he can keep it.

20:24.054 --> 20:26.438
"Your contractions
are like ocean waves,

20:26.506 --> 20:27.857
"coming to the shore.

20:27.941 --> 20:29.558
"Concentrate on
your breath.

20:29.643 --> 20:31.644
"Inhale through
your eyes,

20:31.695 --> 20:34.196
and exhale through...
your vagina."

20:34.281 --> 20:35.848
Can you do that?

20:35.899 --> 20:36.849
Keep reading.

20:36.900 --> 20:38.484
Very impressive if
you can. Okay...

20:38.535 --> 20:40.202
"As another
contraction builds,

20:40.287 --> 20:43.155
"imagine... imagine
your cervix

20:43.206 --> 20:47.159
"is a... a soft-soft...
softly glowing tunnel,

20:47.210 --> 20:50.329
stretching and expanding
to welcome your baby."

20:50.380 --> 20:52.715
Rachel, I'm out. I can't. Come on.
Danny.

20:52.799 --> 20:55.367
Please. What are we doing with
this hippie New Age garbage?

20:55.418 --> 20:57.386
Let's mainline some drugs
immediately.

20:57.470 --> 20:58.587
No, I didn't need drugs
with Grace.

20:58.672 --> 21:00.306
No, I needed drugs,

21:00.373 --> 21:02.057
because you squeezed
my hand so hard

21:02.142 --> 21:03.893
you almost broke
my pinkie finger.

21:03.977 --> 21:05.060
Huh? Hypnobirthing
is for the birds, Rachel.

21:05.145 --> 21:06.145
I'm telling you.

21:06.212 --> 21:08.097
My sister-in-law
swears by it.

21:08.181 --> 21:09.815
Thought it would be

21:09.883 --> 21:11.934
a good way to involve Stan
in the pregnancy.

21:12.018 --> 21:14.403
But... I think it just gave us
something to talk about

21:14.487 --> 21:16.856
so we didn't have
to address our real problems.

21:16.907 --> 21:19.391
Pregnancy is a stress
on any relationship.

21:19.442 --> 21:22.244
We know this,
so let's just...

21:22.329 --> 21:23.395
breathe through
it and relax,

21:23.446 --> 21:24.830
and everything will
be okay, all right?

21:24.898 --> 21:26.899
Thank you, Danny.

21:28.568 --> 21:30.202
You're a good friend.

21:30.253 --> 21:32.288
Anytime.

21:33.907 --> 21:35.507
Hey.

21:35.575 --> 21:37.743
I got gummies, sour gummies
and gummy straws.

21:37.794 --> 21:39.511
Wow! Get over
here right now.

21:39.579 --> 21:40.746
I want some of
your gummies.

21:40.797 --> 21:42.080
What are you guys
talking about?

21:42.132 --> 21:43.299
What are we talking about?

21:43.383 --> 21:44.717
What are we always
talking about?

21:44.768 --> 21:46.585
Talking about our beautiful,
amazing daughter

21:46.636 --> 21:48.103
and how she thinks
that gummies

21:48.188 --> 21:49.555
are a balanced meal.

21:49.606 --> 21:50.806
Huh?

22:12.612 --> 22:14.446
<i>They're going in. Let's move.</i>

22:45.662 --> 22:47.379
So here he is!

22:47.447 --> 22:49.031
Tricky Nicky Chang, huh?

22:49.115 --> 22:50.866
Whoo!

22:50.951 --> 22:53.502
Ha ha!
Looky look at you!

22:53.586 --> 22:56.422
All free, walking around,
enjoying the island.

22:56.489 --> 22:57.706
The whole case fell apart.

22:57.791 --> 23:00.426
So I heard,
so I heard.

23:00.493 --> 23:01.326
Pow, pow, pow!

23:01.378 --> 23:03.345
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who this?

23:03.430 --> 23:05.681
What's this, your double-wide
Johnny Cochran's your bodyguard

23:05.765 --> 23:07.850
or something?
Oh, that's Kamekona.

23:07.934 --> 23:10.352
Hey, yo. That's a shaved-ice
snitch right there.

23:10.437 --> 23:12.221
You know this guy's hot
with the Five-O, right?

23:12.305 --> 23:14.056
No, he's cool,
he's cool.

23:14.140 --> 23:15.107
But don't get him angry.

23:15.174 --> 23:16.976
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

23:17.027 --> 23:18.644
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa. Relax, relax.

23:18.695 --> 23:20.279
What are these, Pradas?

23:20.346 --> 23:22.014
Yeah, the genuine article
right there.

23:22.782 --> 23:24.366
Genuine, huh?

23:24.451 --> 23:25.451
Hey, yo!

23:25.518 --> 23:27.069
I ain't no snitch.

23:27.153 --> 23:29.705
I like to keep
my enemies close,

23:29.789 --> 23:33.158
feed 'em some shave ice,
little bit of fish

23:33.209 --> 23:35.160
and do my business.

23:35.211 --> 23:36.662
Yeah, what business is that?

23:36.713 --> 23:39.364
Make money, spic-and-span.

23:39.416 --> 23:41.250
I run 'em through my trucks,

23:41.334 --> 23:43.002
presto chango,

23:43.053 --> 23:44.503
clean fundage.

23:46.089 --> 23:48.448
You know, better than
that crook, Nederman,

23:48.473 --> 23:49.558
you been using, huh?

23:49.559 --> 23:54.646
In case you hadn't noticed, I mean,
I'm a superstore up in here.

23:54.714 --> 23:55.981
If you didn't know,
the business

23:56.049 --> 23:58.767
done grown since you
been gone, Sang.

23:58.852 --> 24:00.719
So that's what you call
getting a shipment jacked?

24:00.770 --> 24:01.987
Huh? Well, that

24:02.055 --> 24:03.689
didn't happen
when I was running things.

24:03.740 --> 24:06.191
People had respect.

24:06.242 --> 24:07.493
You gotta send a message, brah.

24:07.560 --> 24:09.328
Yo, I got it, big man.

24:09.395 --> 24:10.662
So what happened?

24:10.730 --> 24:13.582
Well, guys with guns happened.

24:13.666 --> 24:15.334
Took something of mine.
No big deal.

24:15.401 --> 24:16.452
So these guys with guns

24:16.536 --> 24:18.754
take down an entire
truckful of stuff

24:18.838 --> 24:21.006
and take only one package?

24:21.074 --> 24:22.207
Yeah, that's right.

24:22.258 --> 24:23.842
So what was in the box?

24:23.910 --> 24:25.594
What...?

24:25.678 --> 24:27.763
Hey, what's with
the secrets, huh?

24:27.847 --> 24:29.515
It's all good, baby.

24:30.550 --> 24:33.435
I just checked
with my big homie in Halawa.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.471
He says yesterday
you was in solitary,

24:35.555 --> 24:37.556
counting the cracks
in the concrete.

24:37.607 --> 24:39.224
Today... today
you're a free man.

24:39.275 --> 24:41.527
How exactly
does that happen, boss?

24:44.823 --> 24:46.023
<i>Guys, we have a problem.</i>

24:52.899 --> 24:54.099
Move, move, move.

25:19.591 --> 25:21.792
Get your hands in the air!

25:23.024 --> 25:24.125

Answers.

26:12.674 --> 26:15.426
What was in the package
that was jacked from the truck?

26:15.510 --> 26:16.594
Who was it for?

26:16.678 --> 26:19.130
Oh, what do I get <i>if</i> I talk?

26:19.214 --> 26:21.298
What do you get?

26:21.383 --> 26:24.552
Maybe you get to not
be an accessory to murder.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.605
Maybe.

26:27.689 --> 26:33.444
Okay, the package that got
jacked... is electronic parts.

26:33.528 --> 26:35.363
- What kind?
- RFID chips.

26:35.430 --> 26:37.531
From Bangkok.

26:37.599 --> 26:38.983
You know, the kind they put
in US passports.

26:39.067 --> 26:41.819
Slip it in the cover
for security.

26:41.903 --> 26:43.571
State Department monitors sales
of that kind of hardware.

26:43.622 --> 26:45.956
Yeah, that's why someone
like me gets their hands on it.

26:46.041 --> 26:47.608
Puts it in a forged passport,

26:47.659 --> 26:49.794
they're not forges
no more.

26:49.878 --> 26:51.479
They're the real deal.

26:51.546 --> 26:53.312
And these chips
are manufactured in Thailand?

26:53.337 --> 26:55.474
Outsourcing.
Ain't it a bitch?

26:55.834 --> 26:56.884
Okay. Who'd you sell 'em to?

26:56.951 --> 26:58.118
I don't know
the guy's name.

26:58.170 --> 26:59.837
Client pays the price,
I don't ask him nothing.

26:59.921 --> 27:01.639
Well, what did he
look like?

27:01.723 --> 27:03.391
<i>Haole.</i> Nothing special.

27:03.458 --> 27:04.809
All right.
So what did this <i>haole</i> do

27:04.893 --> 27:06.394
when his package didn't show up?

27:06.461 --> 27:08.846
Well, now that you mention it,
he didn't do nothing.

27:08.930 --> 27:10.264
I ain't heard from him since.

27:12.084 --> 27:14.185
And it never occurred to you

27:14.269 --> 27:16.954
that maybe he jacked
his own package

27:17.022 --> 27:19.273
so that he wouldn't
have to pay you?

27:23.245 --> 27:26.530
Man, I should have
known something was up

27:26.615 --> 27:28.199
when he started buying in bulk.

27:28.283 --> 27:30.084
What do you mean?

27:30.151 --> 27:31.318
Guy's a regular customer.

27:31.369 --> 27:32.986
He usually buys, like,
four or five chips.

27:33.038 --> 27:34.154
This time, he upped his order.

27:34.206 --> 27:35.539
To what?

27:36.591 --> 27:37.758
A hundred.

27:39.327 --> 27:40.878
<i>A hundred counterfeit</i>
<i>passports?</i>

27:40.962 --> 27:43.130
Okay, that's not
an immigration scam.

27:43.181 --> 27:45.132
That's a serious
terrorist threat.

27:45.183 --> 27:46.500
Tell me about it.

27:46.551 --> 27:48.886
TSA and Homeland Security
have already been put on alert.

27:48.970 --> 27:51.188
Okay. All right.
Did we ID the buyer?

27:51.273 --> 27:52.890
No, not yet. Chin and Kono

27:52.974 --> 27:54.275
have got a lead, though.

27:54.342 --> 27:56.227
It turns out Sang Min
taught Nicky well.

27:56.311 --> 27:57.278
Guy was so paranoid

27:57.345 --> 27:58.863
about getting ripped off
by his own crew,

27:58.947 --> 28:00.180
he rigged every inch

28:00.232 --> 28:01.916
of his warehouse
with surveillance cameras.

28:01.983 --> 28:03.684
Good, good. Maybe he caught
the buyer on tape.

28:03.735 --> 28:04.869
Exactly.

28:04.953 --> 28:06.403
Guys are going through
the footage now.

28:06.488 --> 28:07.571
What about you, buddy?

28:07.656 --> 28:08.739
You all right over there?

28:08.824 --> 28:10.458
Sure, it's good, you know.

28:10.525 --> 28:11.876
Grace took 36 hours.
I don't know.

28:11.960 --> 28:12.960
Waiting-waiting's
the hardest part.

28:13.027 --> 28:14.211
You know, something I heard,

28:14.296 --> 28:16.247
that the labor pains
are the hardest part, Danny.

28:16.314 --> 28:18.299
Please keep in mind
that I'm helping my ex-wife

28:18.366 --> 28:19.633
deliver another man's baby.

28:19.701 --> 28:22.202
So cut me some slack
if you would, please, thank you.

28:22.254 --> 28:23.921
Good point. I'm sorry.

28:24.005 --> 28:25.706
Listen, I gotta take care
of a thing over here, all right?

28:25.757 --> 28:27.591
So you just call me
if anything changes.

28:29.678 --> 28:31.762
Okay. All right.
I got to go. Bye.

28:33.214 --> 28:34.148
Hey, what's going on?

28:34.215 --> 28:35.349
You're the husband, right?

28:35.400 --> 28:37.318
Yeah... no. Yes, I used to be.
What's going on?

28:37.385 --> 28:39.987
Okay. Well, her blood pressure's
dropping and the baby's showing

28:40.054 --> 28:41.038
signs of fetal distress.

28:41.106 --> 28:42.523
What does that mean?

28:42.574 --> 28:44.608
It means we're prepping her
for an emergency C-section.

28:46.661 --> 28:47.444
Daddy?

28:47.529 --> 28:49.280
Hey.

28:49.364 --> 28:51.165
Is Mommy going to be okay?

28:51.232 --> 28:52.666
Of course she's
going to be okay.

28:52.734 --> 28:54.752
What do you mean?
Everything's going to be fine.

28:54.836 --> 28:57.237
You go play your game.
I'll deal with Mommy, okay?

28:57.289 --> 28:58.622
Get out of here.

29:19.311 --> 29:21.061
I said no weapons.

29:21.112 --> 29:22.313
That's what they
always say,

29:22.397 --> 29:24.648
but it rarely turns out
that way, does it?

29:24.699 --> 29:27.818
Have any idea what kind of

29:27.903 --> 29:30.154
self-control it takes not
to kill you both right now?

29:30.238 --> 29:31.822
Yeah, I do.

29:31.907 --> 29:33.958
When I met the man
who murdered my father,

29:34.042 --> 29:35.626
trust me, the only thing
I wanted to do

29:35.710 --> 29:37.294
was put a bullet
right in his head.

29:37.379 --> 29:38.128
But you didn't.

29:38.213 --> 29:39.213
No, I didn't.

29:39.280 --> 29:41.165
Then you're a better man
than I am.

29:41.216 --> 29:42.049
Hey! Hey! Wait! Wait!

29:42.116 --> 29:43.717
Listen to me!

29:43.785 --> 29:45.636
Joe didn't kill
your father, Adam!

29:45.720 --> 29:48.222
So you claim.
Where's your proof?

29:48.289 --> 29:49.390
It's right here.

29:50.892 --> 29:52.343
Easy now.

30:08.476 --> 30:09.660
It's for you.

30:20.672 --> 30:22.172
Hello?

30:24.542 --> 30:25.643
Father?

30:31.466 --> 30:32.967
<i>Ima Doko?</i>

30:33.018 --> 30:36.020
<i>Nan de?</i>

30:36.104 --> 30:37.838
<i>Wakaranai-yo.</i>

30:37.889 --> 30:39.990
This is the right thing to do.

30:40.058 --> 30:41.525
Yeah, we'll see.

30:44.779 --> 30:47.765
<i>Hai, wakarimashita, Otoosan.</i>

30:49.734 --> 30:50.734
<i>Sayonara.</i>

30:55.907 --> 30:58.375
I don't understand. Why?

30:58.460 --> 31:02.179
Old Chinese proverb: "The enemy
of my enemy is my friend."

31:02.247 --> 31:05.749
Our mutual enemy
is Wo Fat.

31:05.834 --> 31:07.167
I don't give a damn about him.

31:07.218 --> 31:08.018
Well, you should.

31:08.086 --> 31:09.887
You should because he kills

31:09.971 --> 31:12.372
anyone who crosses him
or gets in his way.

31:12.424 --> 31:16.093
Your uncle Koji, his own
lieutenant Victor Hesse.

31:17.145 --> 31:19.346
You don't get it, do you?

31:20.482 --> 31:21.565
Adam, your father went

31:21.650 --> 31:23.400
from being a powerful ally
to a loose end.

31:23.485 --> 31:25.019
And he knew that it was only

31:25.070 --> 31:27.021
a matter of time
before Wo Fat went after him.

31:27.072 --> 31:28.739
And you.

31:28.823 --> 31:32.076
That's why your father asked me
to help him fake his death.

31:34.112 --> 31:36.080
He should have told me.

31:36.164 --> 31:37.898
He wanted to,
but he knew that

31:37.949 --> 31:40.067
that would only put you
in jeopardy as well.

31:40.118 --> 31:41.869
His fight would become
your fight.

31:41.920 --> 31:43.354
So he had to make a choice.

31:43.421 --> 31:47.024
Tell you the truth,
risk your life;

31:47.092 --> 31:50.177
tell you a lie
and keep you safe.

31:50.244 --> 31:52.296
You ask me, he chose wisely.

31:55.183 --> 31:56.467
No, I need to see him.

31:56.551 --> 31:58.085
He wouldn't tell me where he is,

31:58.136 --> 32:00.137
but you're going to.

32:00.221 --> 32:00.854
No, I can't.

32:00.922 --> 32:03.090
I made Hiro a promise.

32:03.141 --> 32:04.441
What's important now

32:04.526 --> 32:06.927
is that you proceed
as if your father is dead.

32:06.978 --> 32:09.396
No one can know
he's alive.

32:09.447 --> 32:10.781
But quietly,

32:10.865 --> 32:13.701
we will make inroads
into Wo Fat's organization

32:13.768 --> 32:15.786
until we find him...

32:15.870 --> 32:17.604
and kill him.

32:17.655 --> 32:19.373
We just need
to know if

32:19.440 --> 32:21.125
you're in or if you're out.

32:40.979 --> 32:42.596
<i>All right. Here we go.</i>

32:42.647 --> 32:45.933
Nicky just ID'd the buyer
we're looking for as this guy...

32:46.000 --> 32:47.901
All right. I'll run facial rec,
see if we get a hit.

32:58.663 --> 32:59.997
Richard Detweiller. Guy's local.

33:00.081 --> 33:00.764
Detweiller?

33:00.832 --> 33:02.315
What? You know him?

33:02.367 --> 33:03.333
No.

33:03.418 --> 33:04.484
But I know someone who does.

33:07.539 --> 33:09.807
<i>Yeah, Chin, what's up?</i>

33:13.327 --> 33:15.262
Call you back.

33:17.849 --> 33:19.600
Everything all right?

33:19.667 --> 33:21.351
Who's Richard Detweiller, Joe?

33:21.436 --> 33:23.554
Hmm?

33:23.638 --> 33:27.007
He's an antiques dealer...
a friend.

33:27.058 --> 33:28.859
He's also a master forger,

33:28.943 --> 33:30.978
but I'm guessing
you already knew that.

33:31.029 --> 33:33.180
What were you doing
in his shop this morning?

33:33.231 --> 33:35.699
I was having a passport made.

33:35.784 --> 33:37.851
Why? So you could travel
off the grid, huh?

33:37.902 --> 33:40.320
I went to pick it up,
but Richard never showed.

33:40.371 --> 33:41.455
Let me tell you something
about your friend.

33:41.522 --> 33:42.706
Okay?

33:42.791 --> 33:44.041
While you were waiting for him,

33:44.125 --> 33:46.493
his crew was knocking
over a delivery truck.

33:46.544 --> 33:49.663
They stole a hundred RFID tags,
and they killed the driver, Joe.

33:49.714 --> 33:50.914
- No.
- What do you mean, "no"?

33:50.999 --> 33:52.800
No. Richard doesn't
have a "crew."

33:52.867 --> 33:56.220
He's a bookworm
with a talent for paper.

33:56.304 --> 33:59.306
He used to forge documents
for the CIA back in the '80s.

33:59.373 --> 34:00.207
No way he would be

34:00.258 --> 34:01.541
involved in something
like that.

34:01.593 --> 34:03.594
Okay. Well, why didn't
he show this morning?

34:05.313 --> 34:07.097
That's a good question.

34:13.188 --> 34:16.489
Richard. Richard.

34:18.525 --> 34:19.993
Joe.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.835
He's got a pulse.

34:34.467 --> 34:35.467
All right.

34:35.536 --> 34:37.721
Paramedics are
on their way.

34:37.804 --> 34:39.639
I screwed up, Joe.

34:39.706 --> 34:41.308
I let them run a game on me.

34:41.375 --> 34:42.641
Who?

34:42.710 --> 34:44.244
Couple of Eastern
Europeans.

34:44.312 --> 34:46.313
They dropped the right names
during the introduction,

34:46.380 --> 34:48.481
but something
didn't feel right.

34:48.549 --> 34:51.650
I stalled them for a day
so I could run background,

34:51.719 --> 34:54.521
but the intel
came back too late.

34:54.572 --> 34:56.222
Names, okay?

34:56.274 --> 34:57.357
We need names.

34:57.408 --> 34:59.743
Adler and Bloom.

35:02.446 --> 35:04.063
Always back up
my files.

35:05.899 --> 35:07.167
I should have known

35:07.234 --> 35:09.902
something was wrong when the
shop was closed this morning.

35:09.954 --> 35:11.838
They had you locked up
back here, didn't they?

35:11.905 --> 35:13.456
They made me run
the RFID tags,

35:13.541 --> 35:16.676
hijacked them before my
supplier could take delivery.

35:16.744 --> 35:18.878
Then they forced you
to make the passports?

35:18.930 --> 35:20.880
A hundred of them.

35:20.932 --> 35:22.349
All they got to do
is slap pictures

35:22.416 --> 35:24.551
in the jackets and
they're viable.

35:24.602 --> 35:26.052
Okay.

35:26.103 --> 35:27.837
Looks like they made
the passports for themselves.

35:27.905 --> 35:29.556
Means they're planning
to flee the island.

35:29.607 --> 35:30.923
How long ago
did they leave?

35:30.975 --> 35:31.858
An hour ago,

35:31.925 --> 35:33.143
maybe two.

35:33.227 --> 35:35.028
These guys,

35:35.095 --> 35:37.147
they deal heavy arms
to terrorist types.

35:37.231 --> 35:38.481
Those passports

35:38.566 --> 35:42.452
could end up in the hands of
some very dangerous people.

35:52.163 --> 35:55.915
Last call for
Hawaiian Airlines flight 455,

35:55.967 --> 35:57.801
direct service to Manila.

35:58.886 --> 35:59.970
Thank you.

36:16.203 --> 36:17.570
It's a setup!

36:20.658 --> 36:21.941
Five-O! Hold it right there!

36:21.993 --> 36:22.742
Down on your knees,

36:22.810 --> 36:24.811
hands behind your head.

36:34.622 --> 36:36.423
<i>- Hey, you're doing really good.</i> 
<i>- Just relax.</i>

36:36.490 --> 36:37.590
Everything's perfect, okay?

36:37.658 --> 36:38.658
Can you see what they're doing?

36:38.709 --> 36:39.959
What does it look like?

36:40.011 --> 36:41.828
It looks like
a hand grenade went off.

36:41.879 --> 36:43.179
Nice.

36:43.264 --> 36:44.214
Thanks.
Just being honest.

36:44.298 --> 36:45.432
I'm kidding with you, all right?

36:45.499 --> 36:46.165
Everything's good.

36:46.217 --> 36:47.834
Here we go.
Relax.

36:47.885 --> 36:49.552
Okay, all right, here we go.

36:49.637 --> 36:51.021
What? What do you see?

36:52.356 --> 36:53.973
He's pulling out the baby.

36:54.025 --> 36:55.692
It's beautiful, Rachel.
Everything's good.

36:56.844 --> 36:57.894
It's a boy!

36:57.978 --> 36:58.945
A baby boy!

36:59.012 --> 37:00.063
Is he okay?

37:00.147 --> 37:01.898
He's perfect.

37:01.982 --> 37:03.015
Congratulations.

37:04.068 --> 37:05.017
All right.

37:05.069 --> 37:06.018
All right.

37:06.070 --> 37:08.020
Huh? Huh?

37:08.072 --> 37:11.124
Hey, you made
a beautiful baby boy.

37:11.191 --> 37:14.244
Danny, I don't know
how to thank you.

37:14.328 --> 37:16.413
Oh, I had a blast. It was fun.

37:22.053 --> 37:23.035
Good vocal chords.

37:24.305 --> 37:26.656
Somebody would like
to meet his parents.

37:39.353 --> 37:41.354
Hello, little boy.

37:56.904 --> 37:58.788
<i>It's a boy!</i>

37:58.873 --> 38:00.423
Charles William Edwards.

38:00.508 --> 38:02.408
Six pounds and two ounces.

38:02.460 --> 38:03.176
All right!

38:03.243 --> 38:04.344
That's awesome.

38:04.411 --> 38:05.512
How's Danny?

38:05.579 --> 38:06.513
Danny's fine apparently,

38:06.580 --> 38:07.630
but, you know, he's Danny.

38:07.715 --> 38:08.565
Right.

38:08.632 --> 38:09.849
Wasn't too long ago

38:09.917 --> 38:11.885
he thought that baby was his.
Yeah.

38:11.936 --> 38:13.219
- Yeah.
- Take it from me.

38:13.270 --> 38:15.021
Writing that alimony check
once a month is hard enough.

38:15.088 --> 38:17.256
But helping your ex
through 12 hours of labor?

38:17.308 --> 38:18.575
That's above and beyond.

38:21.595 --> 38:23.429
Guys, could you
give us a second?

38:23.481 --> 38:24.697
Yeah.

38:28.903 --> 38:31.154
All in a day's
work, right?

38:31.238 --> 38:33.272
Yeah.

38:33.324 --> 38:35.408
But there's is one more thing
we need to settle.

38:35.459 --> 38:36.943
I'm pretty sure
you know what it is.

38:36.994 --> 38:38.695
Shelburne.

38:38.763 --> 38:43.383
Don't you think I deserve to
know what the hell is going on?

38:45.419 --> 38:46.953
Yes, I do.

38:47.004 --> 38:49.572
Okay.

38:51.625 --> 38:53.176
Whoa, man, where
you going?

38:53.260 --> 38:54.961
You want answers?

38:55.012 --> 38:56.646
Come with me.

39:09.309 --> 39:12.478
I don't understand.

39:12.530 --> 39:15.114
Your father was the closest
thing I ever had to a brother.

39:15.166 --> 39:16.816
You know that?

39:16.867 --> 39:18.451
He felt the same way
about you.

39:18.502 --> 39:19.752
Hmm.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.738
You remember the day he told you
he was sending you away?

39:21.806 --> 39:23.322
Like it was yesterday, Joe.

39:23.374 --> 39:24.591
On that day,

39:24.658 --> 39:25.658
he made me promise

39:25.709 --> 39:27.260
that if anything
ever happened to him,

39:27.327 --> 39:30.880
I would look after you,
as if you were my own son.

39:30.965 --> 39:33.399
But I broke that promise.

39:33.467 --> 39:35.602
What are you talking about, Joe?

39:35.669 --> 39:38.021
When your father started his
investigation into the Yakuza,

39:38.105 --> 39:40.356
he had no idea how
far it would go

39:40.441 --> 39:42.308
or how dangerous
it would get.

39:42.359 --> 39:44.644
It got so that he was,
he was so paranoid,

39:44.695 --> 39:46.679
he didn't trust the people
he was working with.

39:46.730 --> 39:49.983
So he came to me,
asked for my help.

39:50.034 --> 39:52.569
That's how
Shelburne was born.

39:52.653 --> 39:53.903
Wait a minute.

39:53.988 --> 39:55.989
You're telling me
Shelburne isn't a person?

39:56.040 --> 39:57.540
It's an alias.

39:57.625 --> 39:59.826
A code name we created
to draw attention

39:59.877 --> 40:02.495
and fire away from your
father's investigation,

40:02.546 --> 40:03.963
to protect you and your sister.

40:04.031 --> 40:05.364
Okay, all right.

40:05.416 --> 40:08.751
Well, if it... if it was an
investigation into the Yakuza,

40:08.836 --> 40:11.304
then why does Wo Fat
care so much about Shelburne?

40:11.371 --> 40:15.141
Because Shelburne
killed his father.

40:15.208 --> 40:17.477
And by "Shelburne,"
you mean my father.

40:17.544 --> 40:19.062
No.

40:19.146 --> 40:21.064
It was me.

40:21.148 --> 40:22.381
I killed him.

40:28.022 --> 40:29.489
Wh-What happened?
Who was he...

40:29.556 --> 40:30.490
None of that
matters now.

40:30.557 --> 40:32.075
What's past is past.

40:32.159 --> 40:34.961
The one thing I regret is that
I caused you all this trouble.

40:35.029 --> 40:37.447
I promised to protect you
from all this, and I didn't.

40:37.531 --> 40:40.283
All that I did by coming
back here was make it worse.

40:40.367 --> 40:43.369
And that's why I have to leave.

40:43.420 --> 40:45.672
What are you talk--
No, Joe. No, you don't.

40:45.739 --> 40:47.006
Yes, I do, and you
should know that

40:47.074 --> 40:48.007
better than
anyone, Steve.

40:48.075 --> 40:49.241
When your father died,

40:49.293 --> 40:50.510
there was nothing
you wouldn't have done

40:50.577 --> 40:51.794
to find the man who killed him.

40:51.879 --> 40:53.513
It's the same
with Wo Fat.

40:53.580 --> 40:55.048
He's driven
by revenge.

40:55.099 --> 40:57.550
Nothing is gonna stop him
from coming for me.

40:57.601 --> 40:58.935
Okay, fine,
so we find him first

40:59.019 --> 41:00.920
and we take him down, Joe.
That's what we do.

41:00.971 --> 41:02.639
One day, we will.

41:02.723 --> 41:04.057
We will.

41:04.108 --> 41:08.194
But right now, as
long as I'm here,

41:08.261 --> 41:12.265
you and everyone that you
care about are in danger.

41:16.287 --> 41:18.288
I'm sorry, son.

41:36.557 --> 41:38.558
Where you gonna go?

41:41.929 --> 41:43.930
I'll know when
I get there.

42:01.148 --> 42:02.749
Pretty incredible, isn't it?

42:02.816 --> 42:05.368
Yeah, it is.

42:05.452 --> 42:06.586
He's got your nose.

42:06.653 --> 42:09.038
I seriously doubt that.

42:09.123 --> 42:11.791
Thank you.

42:14.178 --> 42:15.795
Congratulations.

42:15.846 --> 42:18.348
Thanks.

42:20.050 --> 42:21.500
Hey.

42:21.552 --> 42:22.969
Hey.

42:23.053 --> 42:24.837
Wow.

42:24.888 --> 42:26.338
Will you look at that.

42:26.390 --> 42:27.974
If you say he
has my nose,

42:28.025 --> 42:30.009
I'll bust yours.

42:30.060 --> 42:33.730
Good to see you're holding up.

42:33.814 --> 42:35.231
What are you doing?

42:35.315 --> 42:38.451
I am sending Stanley
a photo of his baby boy.

42:38.518 --> 42:40.703
Don't think a father
should ever miss this.

42:53.751 --> 42:55.034
You hungry?

42:55.085 --> 42:56.252
Yeah.

42:56.336 --> 42:58.304
I'll buy you a Zip Pac.

42:58.371 --> 43:01.174
Come on, my treat.
