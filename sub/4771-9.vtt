00:04.640 --> 00:06.085
Previously on "Power"...

00:06.240 --> 00:08.055
I already programmed
the information on his phone.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.680
You'll be able to read
his text messages,

00:09.705 --> 00:11.563
view his incoming
and outgoing call logs.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.529
Carlton Hotel.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.079
Angela told me her investigation
is actually not about Tommy.

00:16.239 --> 00:18.447
- She wants Lobos.
- How long you been smashin' Tasha?

00:18.600 --> 00:20.575
If anything, I'm using her
for information like you wanted.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.095
- Tell me one real thing she told you.
- I know that Uncle G's going

00:23.120 --> 00:25.360
to a big meeting tomorrow afternoon
at the Carlton Hotel.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.040
Tommy trusts me.
I'm gonna surprise Ghost

00:27.120 --> 00:29.851
at the Lobos meeting tomorrow.
Tell Lobos to his face,

00:30.000 --> 00:32.162
Ghost and Tommy done lost control
of the organization.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.084
Why a guy like you
needs my services.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.560
- I feel like I can trust you.
- What makes you think that?

00:36.600 --> 00:40.002
I just saw the distributor
going into the meeting with Lobos.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.401
FBI! Get on the ground!

00:44.280 --> 00:46.123
Angie!
I'm gonna get you, Angela!

00:46.280 --> 00:48.487
Your uncle set me up.
I want you to right Ghost's wrong

00:48.640 --> 00:51.041
for separating us
by taking him out.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.328

and sit down.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.726
All rise.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.281
The honorable
Judge Jennifer Lefevre.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.727
Good morning. Be seated.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.729
We're on the record.

04:39.920 --> 04:44.403
"Case number 6796969.

04:44.560 --> 04:49.771
DM 184, United States of America
vs. Thomas Patrick Egan."

04:49.920 --> 04:52.321
This is a bail hearing
to determine

04:52.520 --> 04:55.683
whether defendant Egan
should be released on bond.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.285
Good morning, Your Honor.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.767
Angela Valdes
for the United States of America.

04:59.920 --> 05:03.129
With me is Assistant
U.S. Attorney Cooper Saxe.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.527
Good morning, Your Honor.
Joseph Proctor,

05:05.680 --> 05:08.763
- counsel for defendant Thomas Egan.
- Good morning, Mr. Proctor.

05:08.920 --> 05:11.002
Does the government wish
to be heard first?

05:12.800 --> 05:15.770
Defendant Egan's ties
to the community are loose.

05:15.960 --> 05:19.521
He has an extensive criminal record,
financial resources,

05:19.680 --> 05:22.524
and the intelligence to make
a good-faith escape.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.365
We feel that Mr. Egan
is a danger to the community

05:25.520 --> 05:27.966
and that there is
a significant risk of flight.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.806
Defendant Egan should be held
without bail until his trial.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.964
Mr. Proctor, does the defendant wish
to rebut the presumption at this time?

05:35.120 --> 05:38.283
If I may, Your Honor,

05:38.480 --> 05:40.642
despite Mr. Egan's past record,

05:40.800 --> 05:43.007
his recent behavior
shows he has now become

05:43.160 --> 05:46.323
an upstanding member
of the community as a business owner.

05:46.480 --> 05:50.326
I assure you, Your Honor,
Thomas Egan is of no flight risk.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.642
He wants to stand
and clear his name.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.811
Having considered
the arguments of counsel,

05:57.000 --> 06:00.527
the pre-trial services report
and recommendation,

06:00.680 --> 06:03.684
the court finds that no
combination of conditions

06:03.880 --> 06:06.486
can assure the defendant's
appearance for trial.

06:06.640 --> 06:08.244
Therefore, bail is denied.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.483
Defendant is remanded to custody
to await trial.

06:11.680 --> 06:15.082
Trial date is set
for the 23rd at 9:00 a.m.,

06:15.240 --> 06:18.005
courtroom 23,
Judge John D. Daniels.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.527
Nice work, Valdes.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.728
You know I'm handling
the trial, right?

06:22.880 --> 06:25.042
We'll see.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.569
When do I get
my fuckin' phone call?

06:36.760 --> 06:38.762
See?

06:38.960 --> 06:41.850
This is how I want things to be.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.565
Me and you.

06:43.720 --> 06:46.690
Me, too, Shawn.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.886
I know you're still married
to Ghost, but...

06:52.040 --> 06:55.044
if we really want this,
can't we make it happen?

06:55.200 --> 06:57.362
Maybe.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.928
It could be the kids.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.402
Hello?

07:11.120 --> 07:14.488
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.084
Tommy?

07:18.240 --> 07:21.289
Okay, okay. Slow down.
What happened?

07:23.160 --> 07:25.083
Where the fuck is Ghost?

07:27.120 --> 07:30.249
Gentlemen.

07:30.400 --> 07:33.847
- Great work at the bail hearing.
- Thank you.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.287
But Proctor seems to be
on his game.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.920
With a case this big, gotta make sure
we're firm on all points.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.809
Wanna box them in.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.088
We have Egan in possession
of a large amount of cash

07:43.240 --> 07:45.925
with intent to exchange those funds
with a known cartel leader,

07:46.080 --> 07:50.768
who, by the way, was in possession
of numerous unlicensed firearms.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.207
Tell me, how are they
gonna get out of that box?

07:55.360 --> 07:57.442
How did you know
they were going to be there?

08:00.800 --> 08:03.451
I had an unofficial tail put on Egan
a couple of days ago.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.446
Set it up through Vice,
tracked him to the location.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.365
I should've said
something, I know.

08:10.520 --> 08:13.205
Can't say I like things
going on behind my back,

08:13.360 --> 08:15.522
but we're here now.

08:15.720 --> 08:18.041
I owe you a drink. My treat.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.487
You nervous?

08:31.640 --> 08:33.130
Ready.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.731
Egan's gonna get
what he deserves.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.008
Hope so.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.726
You know, I heard
what you said to Mike.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.486
You and I both know
there wasn't a tail.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.280
I know you grew up
with James St. Patrick,

08:48.305 --> 08:50.162
but he's gonna
have to come forward.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.360
Friends or not, he's gonna
have to make a statement,

08:52.385 --> 08:54.387
testify against Egan.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.411
And you're gonna have to explain

08:57.560 --> 08:59.483
how you found the location
of the Lobos meet.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.489
And if he's the answer,

09:01.680 --> 09:03.842
you're gonna have to
bring him in to Mike.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.605
Hey.

09:12.360 --> 09:13.725
Hey-

09:20.000 --> 09:22.207
You changed your cell.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.601
Why?

09:24.760 --> 09:26.683
Well, because my number
has a tendency

09:26.840 --> 09:29.047
to get into the wrong hands.

09:39.080 --> 09:41.651
So you arrested Tommy?

09:41.800 --> 09:43.400
Guess you were right
about him all along.

09:43.425 --> 09:45.601
He was standing in a hotel room
with Felipe Lobos

09:45.760 --> 09:47.250
when the agents walked in.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.091
You got Lobos, too?

09:50.240 --> 09:51.969
So you don't need Tommy now.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.771
You told me it wasn't
really Tommy you were after.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.127
But Tommy was arrested
with Lobos

09:57.320 --> 09:59.971
and guns and a lot of money.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.244
Can you help him?

10:12.400 --> 10:15.404
The only way out of this
for Tommy at this point

10:15.560 --> 10:18.769
is to testify against Lobos.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.924
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Tommy won't snitch on Lobos,

10:22.080 --> 10:24.447
so there's gotta
be another way, Ange.

10:26.440 --> 10:28.761
Baby, you're from
the same neighborhood.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.083
It violates everything we believe in
to betray a friend.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.447
You know that.

10:38.760 --> 10:41.081
Hey, come here.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.764
You gotta consider
what matters to you most.

10:48.920 --> 10:50.763
You know, babe?

10:50.960 --> 10:52.962
And then you can make a decision

10:53.120 --> 10:55.361
that goes against
every rule you know.

10:58.120 --> 11:01.806
But you better
consider carefully.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.531
I'll think about
what I can do for him.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.802
I know you will.

11:18.680 --> 11:20.961
You try and clip a nigga like Ghost,
you gotta be precise.

11:20.986 --> 11:22.649
On point, you hear me?

11:22.800 --> 11:25.326
This ain't his first time
at the wrong end of the gun.

11:29.240 --> 11:31.368
Put this on the gun tonight.

11:34.680 --> 11:36.887
It goes in the front.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.327
Look, before the actual meeting
and shit like that,

11:39.480 --> 11:42.848
just hit me right quick, one-two.
Let me know we in motion, all right?

11:43.000 --> 11:45.321
All right. And then what?

11:45.480 --> 11:49.371
When you get in the car, you do
what you normally do... drive.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.688
All right?
You want him to relax.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.683
Don't talk, don't bullshit,
turn the radio on.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.524
Play whatever the fuck
the nigga like.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.170
You got tints
on that truck, right?

11:57.360 --> 12:00.045
Yeah. No one can see inside.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.168
Look, there's an alley
in the West 20s.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.203
It's about a couple minutes
away from his club.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.569
It ends in a garage, dead end.
Nobody'll be back there.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.529
You get to the alley,
simple and plain...

12:09.680 --> 12:11.887
You turn around
and you shoot him.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.367
In broad daylight?

12:14.520 --> 12:16.080
You just said
the truck got tints on it.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.680
Ain't nobody gonna see
the muzzle flash.

12:17.705 --> 12:19.363
- Right.
- After you do it,

12:19.520 --> 12:21.602
you got a short ride
over to this warehouse.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.451
It's not too far
from here, all right?

12:24.600 --> 12:27.285
Give him the address.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.410
- We'll take it from there.
- Once you shoot him,

12:30.600 --> 12:32.967
he's gonna be suckin' wind
and shit tryin' to get air.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.964
Eyes glazed,
mouth like a fuckin' fish.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.451
Can you handle that?

12:37.600 --> 12:39.204
Yeah, I can handle it.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.200
It's gonna be a long car ride
with a dead body

12:41.320 --> 12:44.881
from Manhattan to Queens, man.
Don't get pulled over.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.840
Don't trip and miss a stoplight,
motherfucker.

12:46.865 --> 12:48.927
I won't.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.884
You sure about this?

12:51.080 --> 12:53.162
If you don't want to do it,
let me know now.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.650
I'm in.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.087
- I said I'm in, I meant it.
- All right.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.843
I guess that dick
ain't what it used to be.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.923
- Tash, what the fuck?
- She beat you.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.082
I told you to keep fucking her
to control her mind

13:09.240 --> 13:11.040
- and she beat you anyway.
- Lower your voice.

13:11.065 --> 13:13.804
Tommy's in fucking jail.
We're about to lose everything

13:13.960 --> 13:15.530
because Angela
was smarter than you.

13:15.680 --> 13:19.287
Slow down.
Got the whole thing under control.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.323
- You got the whole thing under control?
- Yes.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.925
Is this the plan
you told me about?

13:23.080 --> 13:26.971
You left out the part where
Tommy's in jail and you're not.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.640
This is just like Kanan
all over again?

13:28.665 --> 13:30.688
I'm not doing this shit here.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.604
Except you didn't
want to tell me

13:32.760 --> 13:35.161
because you knew that I wouldn't
help you sell Tommy out.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.880
This why I saved the Fed bitch's life?
So she could arrest Tommy?

13:37.905 --> 13:39.364
It's not like that at all, T, okay?

13:39.520 --> 13:40.965
I would never do Tommy that way.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.615
Yeah, you know what?
The old Ghost wouldn't.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.135
But you know what? I don't know you.
You are not the man I married,

13:45.160 --> 13:46.800
- not by a long shot.
- I haven't changed.

13:46.954 --> 13:49.034
I'm taking care of Tommy
and it's all gonna work out.

13:49.059 --> 13:51.001
If something happens to him
on the inside,

13:51.160 --> 13:53.128
or if... if he gets convicted...

13:53.280 --> 13:55.681
It's not going to happen!

13:55.840 --> 13:58.127
I fuckin' said I got it.

13:58.280 --> 14:01.966
You're playing with fire, Ghost.

14:02.120 --> 14:05.169
You just better make sure
we don't all get burned.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.368
Egan.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.244
You fucked up my bail hearing.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.528
Come on,
even I couldn't win that one.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.001
You were caught red-handed.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.527
Who's paying for you?

14:28.720 --> 14:31.530
- Where is he?
- He sends his regards.

14:31.720 --> 14:34.041
Well, why the fuck
ain't he in here with me?

14:34.200 --> 14:36.168
He was running late.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.005
But the time he got there,
the Feds had surrounded the building.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.891
But he wants you outta here.
That's why he hired me.

14:42.040 --> 14:45.203
So he just happened
to be running late

14:45.400 --> 14:47.050
the same day
his fucking girlfriend

14:47.200 --> 14:49.521
magically knows the location
of our meetup with Lobos?

14:49.680 --> 14:52.729
- Girlfriend?
- Oh, shit. He ain't tell you?

14:52.880 --> 14:54.689
That bitch
who beat you in court,

14:54.840 --> 14:56.604
he's been fuckin' her
for months.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.888
How do I know that you aren't here
to keep me inside

14:59.080 --> 15:01.040
while the two of them
try to pin everything on me?

15:01.080 --> 15:03.526
Okay, look.
If you don't trust me, I'm happy to go.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.682
You can get a federal
public defender...

15:05.880 --> 15:08.042
Some asshole who's handling
30 cases at once...

15:08.200 --> 15:11.363
Or you can stick with me.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.921
I'm in the Tommy Egan business.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.366
I'm expensive as fuck,

15:15.520 --> 15:18.364
and your boy's paying full freight
to make sure you walk.

15:18.560 --> 15:20.722
So which is it? Should I go?

15:20.880 --> 15:22.769
It's your call.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.651
Going once...

15:25.800 --> 15:26.961
going twice...

15:27.120 --> 15:29.202
Sit the fuck down, Counselor.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.246
Told him what you wanted.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.926
Good. How's he doin'?

15:35.120 --> 15:38.249
He asked about you.
He sounds suspicious.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.085
When you told him
what happened, what did he say?

15:41.240 --> 15:43.242
He said you were fucking
the prosecutor...?

15:43.400 --> 15:46.244
It's not a conflict of interest.
It's a benefit, trust me.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.004
She can help us from the inside.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.401
You just better know
what you're doing.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.880
Just call me the moment
the prosecution's evidence arrives,

15:52.905 --> 15:53.607
okay, Proctor?

15:53.800 --> 15:56.451
Look, I've been doing this a long time.
Egan's the paranoid type.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.800
You sure you just don't want me
to tell him everything?

15:58.825 --> 16:02.121
No. You make sure he doesn't say
a fucking word about Lobos to anyone.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.248
Got you.

16:14.280 --> 16:17.841
Get off that phone.
I need your undivided attention.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.446
Hamilton contracts came in.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.206
They want to roll out
their next line of watches right here.

16:25.320 --> 16:27.721
You talkin' later
in the spring or summer?

16:27.920 --> 16:29.684
We're talking Saturday.
How about that?

16:29.880 --> 16:32.451
Nah, we can't pull that off.
No way.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.729
Overhead, not to mention
acquiring all necessary permits,

16:35.880 --> 16:37.689
police, security personnel.

16:37.840 --> 16:41.003
Permits, police, security,
all taken care of... the whole shebang.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.322
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:45.960 --> 16:49.043
If we do this right, we'll pull in
the biggest haul since we started.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.565
You might hit your mark.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.722
No might about it.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.524
- What's that?
- I gotta get all these records

17:03.680 --> 17:05.682
shipped over
to Stern Headquarters uptown.

17:05.839 --> 17:08.241
I send them
at the end of the week.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.760
Everything has to be
accounted for.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.161
I hear that.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.243
I hate fuckin' paperwork.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.960
It's the most annoying part
of any case.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.079
It's a million copies
for a million different people.

17:21.105 --> 17:23.411
Yeah, but you get it wrong,
and it blows everything up.

17:23.599 --> 17:26.523
- You throwing him in?
- Rolla? Hold off.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.920
We were never able
to confirm enough to establish a link.

17:28.945 --> 17:30.251
Never connected Egan
all the way.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.363
- Don't want to be presumptive.
- Good point.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.601
Did you talk to Mike
about James St. Patrick?

17:45.280 --> 17:48.284
I will after we complete
the transfer.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.966
If everyone can take a moment,
we have a guest.

17:51.120 --> 17:53.885
It's great to see you, sir.
Looking slim.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.361
Mike was telling me you guys

17:56.520 --> 17:58.120
are in the middle
of producing discovery.

17:58.145 --> 18:00.122
Yes, sir.
The defense for all parties

18:00.280 --> 18:02.175
should be in possession of our
evidence by the end of the day.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.929
That's good to hear.
And I understand

18:04.080 --> 18:05.650
it was you
who helped find Lobos.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.484
Yes. Yes, sir.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.722
Well, that's good work, Valdes.
Real good work.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.723
Reflective of our training.

18:11.880 --> 18:14.240
Look, everyone take note.
We need more initiative like this.

18:15.800 --> 18:18.770
Look, Justice wants to ensure
the conviction of Felipe Lobos.

18:18.920 --> 18:21.048
And in order to gain
that assurance,

18:21.240 --> 18:23.680
we're willing to be lenient
with the distributor's involvement

18:23.705 --> 18:26.409
if he were to cooperate.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.801
You talking about
offering Egan a deal?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.401
Egan's a small fish.
Justice wants Lobos.

18:31.560 --> 18:34.166
So let's make sure
we finish the job.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.402
Get Egan to sing.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.649
All right, well,
that's everything.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.804
All the bank statements, everything
you had sent to my house.

18:45.960 --> 18:48.725
What are you gonna do
with $200,000, Tasha?

18:48.880 --> 18:50.440
That's like your
shoe budget for a week.

18:50.465 --> 18:54.001
I don't know, Keisha, okay?
I'm trying to figure it out right now.

18:54.160 --> 18:58.290
What's goin' on, Tasha?
I ain't never seen you like this,

18:58.440 --> 19:00.204
and I know you're not
being straight with me.

19:03.800 --> 19:06.007
Let's just say...

19:06.200 --> 19:08.646
Ghost is in way too deep
with Angela.

19:08.800 --> 19:12.486
- That bitch.
- Yeah, that bitch.

19:12.640 --> 19:16.611
And I gotta protect myself
and the kids.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.282
Look, I may need
to go away, Keisha.

19:25.440 --> 19:28.330
Not tell anybody
where I'm going, not even you.

19:28.520 --> 19:32.570
You hidin' money from Ghost
and now you wanna hide his kids, too?

19:32.720 --> 19:34.484
If he finds out
what you up to, girl,

19:34.600 --> 19:35.960
I don't know
what he would do to...

19:35.985 --> 19:37.724
He's not gonna find out, okay?

19:37.880 --> 19:40.850
I'll be long gone
before he suspects a thing.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.561
I know you're strong, Tasha.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.371
And I'm not just saying this
'cause I'd miss you.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.363
But do you really have to
go off and start

19:49.520 --> 19:52.490
a whole another life
by yourself?

19:52.640 --> 19:55.086
Can't you find another way?

19:59.480 --> 20:02.211
Where's he at?

20:04.080 --> 20:07.482
- Heads up.
- Finally.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.889
Not planning on staying long?

20:14.040 --> 20:19.046
I agreed to hold off on killing Ghost
and take part in your plan, Kanan,

20:19.200 --> 20:21.726
'cause you assured me that you
would be able to use Tommy

20:21.880 --> 20:24.008
to align yourself with Lobos.

20:24.200 --> 20:27.283
However, both Tommy
and Lobos were arrested

20:27.440 --> 20:29.568
and we are no closer
to meeting him.

20:29.720 --> 20:34.203
Explain to me why I do not rid myself
of all of this and go my own way.

20:34.360 --> 20:37.250
Vladimir's got a point, Kanan.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.765
We're all in the same boat.

20:38.960 --> 20:41.770
That last distro I received
is running low.

20:41.920 --> 20:45.527
We need something new or we're gonna
be forced to look at other options.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.643
So what's your plan?

20:48.880 --> 20:52.646
No need to do anything.
Ghost'll be dead by tomorrow.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.483
After Ghost is dead,

20:57.640 --> 20:59.722
we can discuss business
moving forward.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.043
Ghost being dead
is something we all want.

21:03.240 --> 21:06.244
But how does that get us
closer to our objective

21:06.400 --> 21:07.811
with Tommy and Lobos in jail?

21:07.960 --> 21:10.406
Motherfuckers like Lobos
been arrested before.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.086
He not gonna
stop dealing, not now.

21:13.240 --> 21:14.571
Nothing has to change.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.087
After I kill Ghost,
move him out the way,

21:17.240 --> 21:19.402
he'll have no choice
but to come to me.

21:20.920 --> 21:24.766
I hope for your sake
it plays out as you see.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.131
Shawn?

21:45.960 --> 21:48.201
Hey. What'd you
want to talk about?

21:48.360 --> 21:50.522
Come here.

21:57.320 --> 21:59.766
This shit with Tommy.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.962
Ghost says he has it
under control,

22:02.120 --> 22:05.488
but I really don't know
that he does.

22:05.640 --> 22:08.120
I think Tommy
could go to jail for good.

22:08.280 --> 22:11.807
Seems like Ghost is willing
to take the fucking risk.

22:13.160 --> 22:16.687
- I could see Ghost making that call.
- I don't know him anymore.

22:18.320 --> 22:20.800
I don't know if I'm next, Shawn.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.644
I don't know how far he'll go,

22:22.800 --> 22:25.371
and I need to protect
the people I care about,

22:25.520 --> 22:27.363
and I can't do that here.

22:29.520 --> 22:31.887
I'm gonna leave town
with the kids.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.560
- Where would you go?
- I don't know, honestly.

22:37.720 --> 22:42.362
But far away.
Far away from here, from Ghost.

22:42.520 --> 22:44.648
But I don't want to go alone.

22:48.480 --> 22:52.485
I want you to come with us,
with me.

22:58.840 --> 23:01.002
This is all I ever wanted.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.444
And I'm gonna make you happy.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.410
You and the kids.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.530
I just need a couple days.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.524
I can wait.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.367
All right, look,
as my associates continue

23:20.520 --> 23:21.965
to review the evidence
you delivered,

23:22.120 --> 23:24.726
this witch hunt
remains unsubstantiated.

23:24.920 --> 23:27.446
My client tells me he stumbled
into the wrong hotel room.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.682
It's a simple case
of wrong place, wrong time.

23:29.880 --> 23:32.724
If he had any information
regarding Mr. Lobos,

23:32.880 --> 23:34.291
he would be happy to cooperate.

23:34.440 --> 23:36.320
Yeah, there were a lot
of Mexicans in that room.

23:36.360 --> 23:38.761
Which one was he?

23:38.920 --> 23:42.720
Mr. Egan, you're looking
at going away for a very long time.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.565
So what I can offer you
begins and ends

23:45.720 --> 23:48.405
with what you can offer me.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.880
If you want this Lobos guy,

23:55.040 --> 23:57.407
I can't do nothin' for you.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.324
Can I go back to my cell now?

23:59.480 --> 24:00.925
Threats aren't gonna break him.

24:01.120 --> 24:04.567
Everyone's got a soft spot.
Greg, come with me. I got an idea.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.925
Hey. Uncle G's on his way out.

24:28.080 --> 24:30.526
"Uncle G"?

24:31.600 --> 24:33.921
You need to get this shit
out of your mind right now, boy.

24:34.080 --> 24:37.766
He ain't your uncle no more.
Motherfucker never was.

24:37.920 --> 24:40.320
He just another nigga
standing in front of the life you want.

24:40.345 --> 24:42.163
Yeah.

24:42.320 --> 24:43.685
Yeah, you're right. I'm good.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.650
All right, stick to the script.
Holla at me when it's done.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.529
<i>L</i> 9011 you.

24:58.640 --> 25:01.883
- What's up, Uncle G?
- What's up, Shawn?

25:11.960 --> 25:13.883
Midtown.
Meeting's in 30 minutes.

25:14.040 --> 25:16.646
Absolutely.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.685
When you get in the car,

25:24.840 --> 25:28.083
you do what you
normally do... drive.

25:28.240 --> 25:30.925
All right?
You want him to relax.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.208
Don't talk, don't bullshit.
Turn the radio on.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.010
Play whatever the fuck
the nigga like.

25:35.160 --> 25:38.687
No music. I'm expecting a call.

25:38.840 --> 25:41.320
Sure thing.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.323
You get to the alley,
simple and plain...

25:43.520 --> 25:45.921
You turn around
and you shoot him.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.162
Your uncle set me up,

25:55.360 --> 25:57.522
sent me to jail.

25:57.680 --> 26:00.126
All those years I was gone,

26:00.280 --> 26:02.442
Ghost robbed us of that time.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.691
Hey, where you goin'?

26:16.080 --> 26:18.367
- Road's closed.
- Everything okay, Officer?

26:18.520 --> 26:20.887
Water main burst about an hour ago.
Where you headed?

26:21.040 --> 26:24.089
- What?
- I can give you an alternate route.

26:24.240 --> 26:27.562
Midtown.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.882
Okay, a little off-target,
but okay.

26:30.040 --> 26:33.249
Take a left. Left on 8th.
It'll get you right over there.

26:33.440 --> 26:36.125
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

26:43.240 --> 26:46.084
Remind me to talk later.
I've been thinking about it.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.561
Maybe you're right about
that promotion you asked about.

26:48.720 --> 26:51.769
Oh, yeah. Great, Uncle G.

27:03.440 --> 27:06.250
Shouldn't never let a boy
do a man's job, man.

27:07.520 --> 27:10.091
What you wanna do now?

27:10.240 --> 27:12.481
Plan B, motherfucker.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.762
How much longer
we gotta be in here for?

27:15.920 --> 27:19.163
We're gonna be here a while,
so get comfortable.

27:21.320 --> 27:24.449
Egan, got something to show you.

27:25.480 --> 27:27.801
You got a visitor.

27:27.960 --> 27:31.442
You motherfuckers.
What the fuck is my mom doin' here?

27:31.600 --> 27:34.683
Well, you're staring
at a lengthy sentence, Mr. Egan.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.840
And I'm sure the funds you give her
aren't all included in your tax return.

27:37.865 --> 27:40.290
And once you're in prison
with all your assets frozen,

27:40.440 --> 27:42.363
how will Mommy
make her house payments?

27:42.520 --> 27:44.124
Medical bills, insurance...

27:44.280 --> 27:46.931
I mean, that stuff is expensive.

27:47.080 --> 27:49.367
And I'm sure she needs
her... "medicine."

27:49.560 --> 27:50.891
Let's leave
his mother outta this.

27:51.040 --> 27:55.125
She can keep her life the way it is,
Mr. Egan, if you talk.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.050
Stay calm, ma'am.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.487
- Tommy. Oh, honey.
- What the fuck you doing here?

28:00.640 --> 28:02.369
Sweetheart.

28:02.520 --> 28:05.205
These Feds show up at my door
and tell me you're locked up.

28:05.360 --> 28:07.806
- What the hell is happening?
- An obvious manipulation.

28:07.960 --> 28:09.803
The woman wanted to see her son.

28:09.960 --> 28:11.405
- It's still America.
- Right.

28:11.560 --> 28:12.891
Get the fuck outta here.
Go home.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.400
Look, whatever
they think you did,

28:14.520 --> 28:16.522
you gotta tell them
what they wanna know.

28:16.680 --> 28:20.002
Okay, all right. My client would like
a moment alone with his mother, so...

28:20.160 --> 28:21.571
Yeah.

28:21.760 --> 28:22.886
Of course.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.201
Tommy.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.850
Be good.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.010
She looks even more coked-up now

28:33.160 --> 28:34.889
than she did
when we were in high school.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.361
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, she was definitely

28:37.520 --> 28:40.171
"chewing the invisible sandwich"
all the way over from Babylon.

28:41.520 --> 28:44.205
With a woman like that
for a mother, he never had a chance.

28:44.360 --> 28:46.203
Yeah, every criminal
has a sob story.

28:46.360 --> 28:47.850
Don't get soft on us now,
Angela.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.844
We're gonna nail
this sucker to the wall.

28:51.040 --> 28:53.771
Honey, they said
they're gonna take the house.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.440
Everything you gave me,
they're gonna take it all.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.680
They're just saying that shit
to fuck with your head.

28:58.705 --> 29:01.528
No, they meant it.
They're gonna take everything.

29:01.680 --> 29:05.526
- They can do that, can't they?
- Yes, they can, if they determine

29:05.720 --> 29:08.041
you bought the house with money
from illegal proceeds.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.567
- So I'm totally fucked, then!
- Ma, would you shut...

29:15.280 --> 29:18.409
- That's illegal.
- What? It was an honest mistake, Greg.

29:18.560 --> 29:19.925
Two seconds.

29:20.080 --> 29:22.651
Just to see if we're
making some headway.

29:22.800 --> 29:26.566
Even if it means I lose
every goddamn thing I own?

29:26.720 --> 29:29.485
God, you never loved me.
You monster.

29:29.640 --> 29:31.608
You'd throw your own mother over

29:31.760 --> 29:33.728
for some asshole
you barely know.

29:33.880 --> 29:36.121
If it means saving both our lives,
yeah, I fuckin' will!

29:36.280 --> 29:38.520
Would you shut the fuck up
and listen to me for a second?

29:38.560 --> 29:39.880
- I hate the way you...
- Shut up.

29:39.920 --> 29:42.241
Shut the fuck up,
you fuckin' ditzy bitch.

29:42.400 --> 29:44.640
If you don't know nothin' about me,
you should know this.

29:44.665 --> 29:46.562
I ain't never gonna be
no fuckin' snitch.

29:46.760 --> 29:48.489
Not for you, not for nobody.

29:48.680 --> 29:51.411
You fucking pig.
You're an asshole!

29:51.600 --> 29:54.843
Let's go take a break,
calm down a little bit,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.446
get some water...

29:57.600 --> 30:00.444
We don't need his testimony
to convict Lobos.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.524
Yeah, but it would've been nice.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.808
Too bad, Tommy Egan.

30:06.960 --> 30:09.930
Enjoy being in prison
for the rest of your life.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.762
- Hey, come in.
- You were right about Tommy.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.487
He won't break.

30:24.520 --> 30:25.965
You talked to him?

30:26.120 --> 30:29.283
No, my boss did,
my... my colleagues.

30:29.440 --> 30:31.442
They tried everything.

30:31.640 --> 30:34.120
I didn't want you to get him
to testify against this Lobos guy.

30:34.145 --> 30:36.287
I told you
that wasn't gonna work.

30:36.440 --> 30:39.489
Angie, you gotta...
You gotta figure out another way.

30:39.640 --> 30:42.484
I can try talking to his lawyer
about a deal,

30:42.640 --> 30:44.369
a confession,
or shorter sentence,

30:44.520 --> 30:48.969
but I'm not sure
my boss will sign off.

30:51.040 --> 30:53.327
And the truth is...

30:55.680 --> 30:57.842
I don't think he deserves it.

30:59.480 --> 31:03.326
He was in that room with Lobos,

31:03.480 --> 31:05.323
and he is a major drug dealer.

31:05.480 --> 31:08.848
And sometimes people
deserve to pay the price.

31:10.840 --> 31:14.003
I think you want me
to protect someone

31:14.160 --> 31:16.208
who legally, morally,

31:16.360 --> 31:19.330
fundamentally
doesn't deserve protection.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.481
I think we should stop talking
about this tonight.

31:30.640 --> 31:33.883
We can't play this game forever.

31:34.040 --> 31:36.441
This is the only thing
I can think about.

31:36.600 --> 31:40.525
Hey. The only thing?

31:40.680 --> 31:42.091
- Why, Jamie?
- Angie, stop.

31:42.240 --> 31:44.402
- I need to know why.
- Please, stop.

31:44.560 --> 31:46.403
I can't.

31:46.560 --> 31:48.767
I need to ask you.
I need to know.

31:51.240 --> 31:54.210
Why ask a question
when you don't want the answer?

32:14.040 --> 32:17.089
Tommy's gonna go to prison
eventually, Jamie.

32:21.280 --> 32:23.567
There's consequences
to our actions, Angie.

32:23.720 --> 32:26.166
For all of us.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.528
We're running out of time,
aren't we?

32:32.720 --> 32:35.087
I hope not.

32:39.400 --> 32:42.085
But that's up to you.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.963
Proctor? Yeah.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.804
We need to talk.

33:18.040 --> 33:20.486
Egan, on the gate.

33:20.680 --> 33:22.728
No sunbathing for me today.
Maybe tomorrow.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.882
Let's go.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.644
Where the hell we goin'?

33:38.640 --> 33:40.688
Hey, motherfucker,
I said, where the hell we goin'?

33:40.840 --> 33:42.842
Just keep moving.

34:08.679 --> 34:11.047
Have a seat, Tommy.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.887
You gonna take off these cuffs?

34:22.080 --> 34:24.686
No.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.889
I ain't see no cameras in here.

34:32.040 --> 34:35.123
No mics.
And I don't see my lawyer.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.123
Nope, just you and me in here.

34:37.280 --> 34:39.442
So no reason not to talk.

34:41.280 --> 34:44.045
- I want to help you.
- Help me? That's funny.

34:44.199 --> 34:47.123
That's fuckin' hilarious.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.647
You hate my guts.
You always have.

34:49.800 --> 34:53.407
Jamie asked me to help you.
That's why we're in here.

34:53.560 --> 34:56.324
So you are workin' together.
I fuckin' knew it.

34:56.480 --> 34:59.723
No, I want you to go to prison
for the rest of your life.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.644
He doesn't.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.167
But he doesn't get
that the only way I can help you

35:04.320 --> 35:06.721
is if you testify against Lobos.

35:06.880 --> 35:10.646
If it's reprisal,
revenge you're worried about,

35:10.800 --> 35:12.325
I can get you
witness protection.

35:12.480 --> 35:15.324
I can even relocate your mother.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.962
The government doesn't want you.
They want Lobos.

35:19.120 --> 35:21.851
Maybe I can get your sentence
down to 15 years.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.764
15 years, you...

35:23.920 --> 35:25.081
Bitch!

35:25.240 --> 35:26.924
Your pussy must be
made out of poison.

35:27.080 --> 35:28.764
It's like the acid
ate his fucking brain.

35:28.920 --> 35:32.242
You ruined him first,
you fuckin' asshole.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.444
You want me to snitch so bad.

35:43.080 --> 35:44.969
I ain't gonna give you Lobos,

35:45.160 --> 35:48.130
but I can think of someone else
I can give you instead.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.645
Nah?

35:49.800 --> 35:51.962
You don't want that, do you?

35:52.120 --> 35:54.771
That don't work with you
and Jamie's little plan.

35:54.960 --> 35:57.531
Tommy, Jamie and I
don't have a plan.

35:57.680 --> 36:00.524
Sure.
That's what I'll tell the judge.

36:00.720 --> 36:02.290
He paid for my lawyer, you know.

36:02.440 --> 36:04.124
He wants me to trust
that guy to save me.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.203
But maybe I should
fuckin' save myself.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.840
Jamie wouldn't hurt you.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.049
Are you so sure
about that, Angie?

36:12.200 --> 36:15.283
Are you sure
you know him that well?

36:17.720 --> 36:20.041
Sorry, Miss Valdes.
His lawyer's here.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.643
Proctor, I need to talk to you.

36:35.800 --> 36:37.325
I want to tell
the judge something.

36:37.480 --> 36:40.051
- No. No, no, no. Not now.
- It's about the...

36:40.200 --> 36:41.690
Just keep your mouth shut.

36:41.880 --> 36:45.009
Trust me,
don't say a word, okay?

36:45.160 --> 36:47.162
Defense counsel
has filed a motion

36:47.320 --> 36:52.167
to dismiss the complaint against
the defendant, Thomas Patrick Egan.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.209
This better be good,
Mr. Proctor.

36:54.360 --> 36:58.365
Your Honor, the defense
would like to ask the court

36:58.520 --> 37:01.683
to suppress the government's
identification of my client

37:01.840 --> 37:06.402
as the New York distributor for
defendant Lobos' alleged drug network

37:06.560 --> 37:08.847
and any related
testimony or evidence.

37:09.000 --> 37:13.130
We submit that the partial sketch
attributed to witness statements

37:13.280 --> 37:16.409
from Nomar Arcielo
and described in the affidavit

37:16.560 --> 37:19.769
as the primary evidence
used to identify Mr. Egan

37:19.960 --> 37:24.966
was not, in fact,
the sketch used in said ID.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.929
What am I looking at, Counselor?

37:27.080 --> 37:29.731
We believe
that the identification for Mr. Egan

37:29.880 --> 37:33.566
was achieved through a facial
recognition match of this sketch

37:33.720 --> 37:36.769
completed by Isabel Ruiz,

37:36.920 --> 37:39.571
the 14-year-old daughter
of Carlos Ruiz,

37:39.720 --> 37:41.563
head of the Soldado Nation.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.961
A sketch obtained
from a 14-year-old

37:44.120 --> 37:46.771
in, no doubt,
an environment of duress

37:46.920 --> 37:51.562
and undue influence
from an overzealous AUSA.

37:51.720 --> 37:53.404
That's why they left it
out of evidence.

37:53.560 --> 37:56.962
It is your belief
that the completed sketch

37:57.120 --> 37:59.282
was withheld in order
to deceive the court?

37:59.440 --> 38:01.090
That's a very serious charge,
Mr. Proctor.

38:01.240 --> 38:03.607
Your Honor,
the partial sketch was sufficient

38:03.800 --> 38:05.450
to identify the defendant

38:05.600 --> 38:08.171
and properly presented
in the affidavit on that basis.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.163
We don't recognize
this completed sketch,

38:10.320 --> 38:12.482
but I'm sure its lack
of inclusion in discovery

38:12.680 --> 38:14.523
was a simple clerical error.

38:14.680 --> 38:16.125
Excuse my tone, Your Honor,

38:16.280 --> 38:19.329
but that would be
a pretty convenient clerical error.

38:19.520 --> 38:21.522
I agree.

38:21.680 --> 38:23.762
The government's exclusion
of the full sketch

38:23.920 --> 38:27.925
and the likelihood that it
and not the partial sketch

38:28.080 --> 38:30.970
led to the ID of Mr. Egan
as your suspect...

38:31.160 --> 38:33.606
It's hard to ignore.

38:33.760 --> 38:36.491
Your Honor, putting aside the issue
of the sketch for a moment,

38:36.640 --> 38:40.804
the plain fact is defendant Egan
was still arrested in that hotel room

38:41.000 --> 38:44.322
with Felipe Lobos in plain violation
of numerous federal laws.

38:44.480 --> 38:46.642
Even so, Your Honor,
if the sketch is dirty,

38:46.840 --> 38:48.604
then every subsequent
piece of evidence,

38:48.800 --> 38:51.121
every government action
against Mr. Egan,

38:51.280 --> 38:54.443
including the tail leading to his arrest
in said hotel room

38:54.640 --> 38:57.007
is fruit of the same
poisonous tree.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.801
I hereby exclude
the government's identification

39:04.960 --> 39:08.806
of Thomas Patrick Egan.
The ID is out.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.964
And without a solid ID,
the government lacks probable cause

39:12.160 --> 39:14.640
and the court finds it proper
to dismiss the complaint.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.404
Your Honor,
in the interest of justice...

39:16.560 --> 39:19.564
We request you dismiss
with prejudice, Your Honor.

39:19.720 --> 39:23.805
Prosecutorial malfeasance
of this kind deserves sanctions,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.002
and my client should be able
to walk away free

39:26.160 --> 39:28.561
knowing the government
cannot retaliate.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.364
I agree.

39:30.520 --> 39:33.410
The complaint is hereby
dismissed with prejudice.

39:33.560 --> 39:38.168
Someone on your staff needs
a disciplinary hearing, Miss Valdes.

39:38.320 --> 39:40.049
Mr. Egan, you're free to go.

39:40.200 --> 39:42.248
Marshals, escort him back to MCC

39:42.440 --> 39:43.851
for processing
out of the system.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.889
Thank you, Your Honor.

39:58.760 --> 40:00.842
How could you do this
to me, Jamie?

40:01.040 --> 40:03.691
I could lose my fucking job!

40:03.840 --> 40:06.280
You didn't think I was gonna
let Tommy rot in prison, did you?

40:06.305 --> 40:08.686
Yeah, all that crap
about getting me to help him?

40:08.880 --> 40:10.560
That was all bullshit
to keep me distracted

40:10.600 --> 40:12.364
so I'd never see this coming.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.761
No, Angela. It wasn't bullshit.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.520
If you had figured out
a way to help him,

40:16.545 --> 40:18.090
I wouldn't have had
to do this at all.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.129
You'll do anything, won't you?

40:20.280 --> 40:22.567
Say anything
to get what you want.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.449
Won't you?

40:24.600 --> 40:26.728
Come on,
we're just alike, Angela.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.962
Don't get all new on me
like you been playin' fair.

40:29.120 --> 40:31.282
You stole that sketch
from my apartment.

40:31.440 --> 40:33.568
And you cloned my phone
and followed me to the hotel.

40:33.720 --> 40:36.405
If I was in that room with Tommy,
I'd be in custody right now.

40:36.560 --> 40:39.769
You knew I was following you.
I played right into your hands.

40:39.920 --> 40:44.244
And I gave you Lobos
for your troubles!

40:44.400 --> 40:46.562
But you can't have Tommy.

40:50.400 --> 40:53.290
We've both been
playing dirty, Angie.

40:53.440 --> 40:56.250
You're just mad you lost.

40:59.080 --> 41:01.242
And I'm gonna get
my club back from Stern,

41:01.400 --> 41:03.681
and then everything we wanted
since we were in high school

41:03.706 --> 41:05.281
is there for us to take.

41:05.480 --> 41:07.608
You said all along
that what you wanted

41:07.760 --> 41:09.922
was a life with me.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.126
I wanted a life with Jamie.

41:20.280 --> 41:24.524
This, you...

41:24.680 --> 41:28.207
you're not Jamie anymore.

41:28.360 --> 41:30.647
Time's up.

41:30.840 --> 41:33.207
Say it to my face.

41:33.360 --> 41:37.206
Say it to my face so that I can never
deny it to myself again.

41:37.360 --> 41:39.442
Are you Ghost?

41:43.440 --> 41:45.966
If I were Ghost,
would I answer that question?

41:51.800 --> 41:53.723
Why does it matter?

41:53.880 --> 41:56.121
There's nothing stoppin' us.

41:56.320 --> 41:59.244
Nothing anymore, baby.
Not Tasha, not the case.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.721
Everything that's in the past
can stay in the past.

42:01.880 --> 42:04.884
Stop playing games. It's over.

42:05.080 --> 42:08.562
No, that's the lawyer talking.
What do you want?

42:08.720 --> 42:12.042
I know you want me.
I know you want us.

42:12.200 --> 42:14.328
I've been this guy all along.

42:14.480 --> 42:17.086
If you love me,
this is who you loved.

42:17.240 --> 42:21.165
I loved you because
I thought you were different.

42:21.320 --> 42:24.608
Special.
I thought you were like me,

42:24.760 --> 42:27.684
trying to find a way out
from where you came from.

42:27.840 --> 42:31.367
This... this club,

42:31.520 --> 42:33.682
this dream, that's what I loved.

42:33.840 --> 42:36.366
That hasn't changed.
It's still there.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.249
Bullshit.

42:38.400 --> 42:40.880
It's all smoke and mirrors.

42:41.040 --> 42:43.407
Remember what you said to me?

42:43.560 --> 42:46.689
You sell people a fantasy.

42:46.840 --> 42:50.606
That's all that you are,
a fantasy.

42:52.360 --> 42:54.886
Fuck you, Ghost.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.767
♪ I love it when ya fire it up ♪

43:24.920 --> 43:27.287
♪ I'm here ♪

43:27.440 --> 43:30.125

43:48.440 --> 43:50.408
The good people of Hamilton.

43:50.600 --> 43:52.602
Glad you could make it.
You look nice.

43:52.760 --> 43:54.842
- Hi, how are you?
- Thank you for coming.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.415
- Thank you so much for having us.
- Thank you, man.

43:56.440 --> 43:57.805
- You like that?
- Great timepiece.

43:57.960 --> 44:00.088
- Y'all be good.
- Good guy.

44:02.920 --> 44:06.481
Dominque, make sure you take care
of Hamilton. Thank you.

44:06.640 --> 44:09.610
- What's up, boss?
- You got it. How we lookin'?

44:09.760 --> 44:12.604
Killin' it, man. But we're
running out of the good stuff.

44:12.760 --> 44:15.440
- Just gonna run in back and grab more.
- Nah, I'll take care of it.

44:15.465 --> 44:17.145
You keep slingin'.
Make these people happy.

44:17.170 --> 44:19.026
- All right.
- Be back in a minute.

44:32.800 --> 44:35.883
Don't move.

44:38.480 --> 44:41.051
Drop the keys.

44:44.560 --> 44:48.565
You picked a hell of a night
for this, Shawn.

44:48.720 --> 44:51.371
I would ask why,
but I got a feeling I already know.

44:51.520 --> 44:53.841
- Kanan.
- Shut up.

44:55.400 --> 44:59.166
What's the plan here, Shawn?

44:59.320 --> 45:01.163
I know you ain't got
a change of clothes.

45:01.320 --> 45:02.960
And what they don't
show you in the movies

45:02.985 --> 45:06.162
is that when you shoot somebody
this close, there's blowback.

45:06.320 --> 45:08.926
You shoot me, blood spatters
all over your shirt,

45:09.080 --> 45:10.844
you run outta here,
people will notice.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.207
<i>Shut up.</i>

45:14.680 --> 45:17.160
You ain't gonna talk
your way outta this, Ghost.

45:17.320 --> 45:19.402
You ain't gonna
talk me out of it.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.401
My dad told me that you
sent him to jail.

45:26.200 --> 45:29.010
That you set him up.

45:31.680 --> 45:33.728
I ain't gonna lie to you.
It's true.

45:35.520 --> 45:37.443
Back then, I had big plans.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.682
Big plans
that Kanan couldn't see.

45:39.880 --> 45:45.125
So it was either set him up
for him to go away or it was...

45:45.280 --> 45:47.886
Or it was me killing him.

45:48.040 --> 45:50.407
I wasn't gonna kill him.

45:52.600 --> 45:55.410
When my pops died,
your dad was there for me, man.

45:58.200 --> 46:01.329
I looked up to Kanan.
Hell, I needed him.

46:04.120 --> 46:07.408
At one point in my life,
I loved your pops very much.

46:07.560 --> 46:12.282
Love? What do you know
about love?

46:12.440 --> 46:15.125
You loved my dad,
but you sent him up.

46:15.280 --> 46:17.000
You love Tasha, but you
been cheating on her

46:17.025 --> 46:19.765
for fuckin'
I don't know how long.

46:19.960 --> 46:23.089
She deserves better than you.

46:23.240 --> 46:26.562
- She deserves...
- She deserves what?

46:26.760 --> 46:29.127
- What, Shawn, you?
- Yeah, me!

46:30.440 --> 46:33.444
<i>Fucker.</i>

46:33.640 --> 46:36.689
While you was out
fuckin' around with Angela,

46:36.840 --> 46:38.842
I had Tasha's back.

46:41.760 --> 46:45.731
I held it down when you forgot
all about her.

46:45.880 --> 46:48.240
You know, you keep sayin'
that we just alike, but we're not.

46:48.320 --> 46:50.527
When I say something, I mean it.

46:50.680 --> 46:52.680
When I say I'm gonna do something,
I fuckin' do it.

46:52.800 --> 46:55.326
Yeah, you right.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.528
Everything
you fuckin' said is right.

46:57.680 --> 47:00.331
You are not like me.

47:00.480 --> 47:03.165
You ain't built for this.

47:03.320 --> 47:06.130
I always known it.
I think you have as well.

47:06.280 --> 47:09.329
But what Kanan's
asking you to do, Shawn...

47:12.200 --> 47:14.328
no real father...

47:16.640 --> 47:19.564
should ever ask of their son.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.881
Kanan and I chose our path.

47:26.040 --> 47:27.320
By puttin' that gun
in your hand,

47:27.400 --> 47:29.687
he's trying to choose yours
for you.

47:31.640 --> 47:34.166
- But I could get it back, though.
- You shut up.

47:36.200 --> 47:38.521
- Drop the gun.
- I said shut up!

47:38.680 --> 47:40.569
I got the fuckin' gun now.

47:42.920 --> 47:44.331
Now I got it, bitch.

47:44.480 --> 47:47.051
Now I fuckin' got it,
fuck nigga.

47:47.200 --> 47:49.726
- I deserve this.
- Yeah, you fuckin' deserve it.

47:49.880 --> 47:51.723
Not just for trying
to kill me, Shawn,

47:51.880 --> 47:54.167
but for whatever it is
you got goin' on with my wife.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.884
That's why you gotta go.

48:06.040 --> 48:07.883
You're not cut out for this.

48:08.040 --> 48:10.520
I want you to leave.

48:10.680 --> 48:13.206
Not just Truth.
I want you to leave New York.

48:13.360 --> 48:15.886
Get up.

48:19.400 --> 48:21.767
Go be a better man than Kanan,

48:21.960 --> 48:25.043
not the man he's trying
to turn you into.

48:27.680 --> 48:29.682
Go.

48:36.240 --> 48:38.607
- Uncle G, I'm...
- Go!

48:55.920 --> 48:58.924
Greg, please,
you can yell at me tomorrow.

48:59.120 --> 49:00.406
No, we're gonna do this now.

49:00.560 --> 49:02.767
I just... I think I finally
figured it all out.

49:02.960 --> 49:04.610
What are you talking about?

49:04.760 --> 49:07.127
I've been...
I've been watching Egan, right?

49:08.480 --> 49:11.609
And Lobos wouldn't trust that guy
to run an organization this complex.

49:11.800 --> 49:14.087
But you know who I would trust?

49:14.240 --> 49:17.642
I think James St. Patrick
is Ghost...

49:19.120 --> 49:22.124
and I think you have been working
with him to protect Tommy Egan.

49:23.640 --> 49:25.961
Why would you think that?

49:27.480 --> 49:30.450
I saw you together outside
your apartment a few weeks ago.

49:30.600 --> 49:33.649
Hold on.

49:33.800 --> 49:36.770
And you saw him
at his club tonight.

49:36.920 --> 49:40.129
- You've been following me.
- Yes. Absolutely, Angela.

49:40.280 --> 49:42.521
And it's a good thing
that I have,

49:42.680 --> 49:46.002
because now, finally,
I can get to the truth of it all.

49:46.160 --> 49:48.162
And it's... it's...
It all makes sense.

49:48.320 --> 49:51.642
The tip that you got from St. Patrick
about the Lobos meet,

49:51.840 --> 49:54.491
that's all part of the plan.

49:54.640 --> 49:58.361
We put all of our attention
on arresting Egan

49:58.520 --> 50:02.445
while you and Jamie work
with Proctor to get him out.

50:02.640 --> 50:05.166
Who else would have known
about the sketch, Angela?

50:07.680 --> 50:09.682
I don't... it's up to Collins

50:09.840 --> 50:11.808
as to what else happens to you
from here on out.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.002
God damn it, Angela.

50:16.160 --> 50:18.162
You're right.

50:18.320 --> 50:20.687
But not about me.

50:23.720 --> 50:26.690
I went by his club tonight
and confronted him.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.685
He didn't deny being involved.

50:30.880 --> 50:33.929
I've been looking into James
for some time now.

50:34.080 --> 50:37.368
I kept it to myself
because I didn't want you

50:37.520 --> 50:40.330
out on a limb backing me
if all this was bullshit.

50:40.480 --> 50:44.371
- And the tip?
- Part of his plan.

50:44.560 --> 50:47.769
I thought he was a good man.

50:47.920 --> 50:50.082
But I was wrong.

50:53.040 --> 50:55.850
He played me just like you said.

50:59.720 --> 51:01.882
And that's why you were crying
when you left the club?

51:02.040 --> 51:04.884
I'm an idiot.

51:11.120 --> 51:13.600
I thought he and I were...

51:14.680 --> 51:16.364
friends.

51:18.520 --> 51:21.251
All right, I can get this information
to Mike and Collins tonight.

51:21.400 --> 51:24.051
We can get St. Patrick
before he moves on

51:24.200 --> 51:26.407
and we can have him testify
against Lobos

51:26.600 --> 51:27.960
if we got him
dead to rights, yeah?

51:27.985 --> 51:28.921
- Right.
- Right?

51:29.080 --> 51:30.923
Good.

51:31.080 --> 51:33.447
But I'm not sure we have
enough for a warrant.

51:33.600 --> 51:36.331
I mean, enough for it to stick.

51:36.480 --> 51:38.608
Maybe hindering
prosecution, maybe,

51:38.760 --> 51:42.287
but not enough for the drug charges.
Not enough to prove that he's Ghost.

51:44.240 --> 51:47.926
I think we should build
a case against him tonight.

51:48.120 --> 51:52.444
Sit down together,
see what we have.

51:52.600 --> 51:56.127
- Go to Mike tomorrow.
- Okay.

51:56.280 --> 51:59.124
Okay, Angela.
Yeah, let's do that.

51:59.280 --> 52:02.602
Tomorrow morning. Together.

52:02.800 --> 52:06.964
All right. Tell me everything
you've got on James St. Patrick.

52:07.120 --> 52:09.327
We're gonna take him down.

52:22.360 --> 52:24.966
You look like a movie star.
Get the fuck in the car.

52:31.640 --> 52:33.642
It's good
to have you back, brother.

52:33.800 --> 52:35.609
You came through for me.

52:35.760 --> 52:37.489
Of course I did.
Get the fuck out of here.

52:37.640 --> 52:39.529
You didn't doubt me, did you?

52:39.680 --> 52:42.968
Well, to be honest, you had your boy
worried there for a minute.

52:43.120 --> 52:45.441
I was getting it from all angles
the whole time.

52:45.640 --> 52:48.564
- Feds can be persuasive.
- Yeah, but you held it down, Tommy.

52:48.720 --> 52:50.848
Of fucking course.
You should have seen

52:51.000 --> 52:54.129
that bitch Angela's face
when the case got tossed.

52:54.280 --> 52:56.203
It was fucking priceless.

52:56.400 --> 52:58.164
So what do we do now?
