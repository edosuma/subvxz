04:17.548 --> 04:18.675

04:18.757 --> 04:21.511
- Oh, he was captured
by The Thumb Buddies.

04:21.594 --> 04:22.804
- What? Uh, I think
you're mistaken,

04:22.887 --> 04:24.764
- I'm sorry, sounded like
you said "somebodies"

04:24.847 --> 04:26.182
- 'Cuz we captured
Stainless Steve, and...

04:26.265 --> 04:27.558
I don't know
what she's saying.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.018
And I'm trying
to explain to her...

04:29.102 --> 04:31.771
that he and I were the ones
that captured Stainless Steve.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.731
- I got hit by something
and flew over there...

04:33.815 --> 04:35.650
- Thank you.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.194

- We done?

04:38.277 --> 04:40.113
- That's not the end
of the interview.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.364
I mean, I had more
to say, and...

04:41.447 --> 04:42.907
he was talking
and I was talking...

04:42.991 --> 04:44.993
- Yeah, I'm fine...

04:45.076 --> 04:46.452
- Hey, I found the sandwich.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.955
- It all just kinda happened.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.289
I wanted an after-school job.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.083
But then,
an indestructible superhero

04:52.166 --> 04:53.793
hired me to be his sidekick.

04:53.876 --> 04:54.460
- Ah!

04:54.544 --> 04:55.336
- Now we blow bubbles...

04:55.420 --> 04:56.796

Feels good.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.342
- Oh. This is my, uh,
Thumb Buddies shirt.

05:43.426 --> 05:46.846
- Yeah, well you
better take that off.

05:46.929 --> 05:49.307
{\an8}- Why?

05:49.390 --> 05:52.143
- 'Cuz last week,
Ray and Henry

05:52.226 --> 05:53.686
caught that criminal,
Stainless Steve,

05:53.770 --> 05:55.521
and those "thumb buddy" guys
took credit for the capture.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.442
- So?

05:59.525 --> 06:02.320
{\an8}- So Ray and Henry
were pretty mad about it,

06:02.403 --> 06:03.780
{\an8}and if I were you
I'd take...

06:06.866 --> 06:07.867
Hey, how'd it go
at the baseball game?

06:07.950 --> 06:10.161
- Ohhh, I dunno,

06:10.244 --> 06:11.496
I guess I'd say it
went pretty well.

06:11.579 --> 06:12.163
- Yeah, I mean, we didn't
really do that much,

06:12.246 --> 06:13.331
{\an8}other than, uhhhhh...

06:13.414 --> 06:15.291
{\an8}- We fought a bear!
- We fought a bear!

06:15.375 --> 06:17.877
- Oh, my god!
- Yes, we did.

06:17.960 --> 06:22.340
- Rawr! Kah!

06:22.423 --> 06:24.634
- HEY! Hey hey hey!
What bear?!?

06:24.717 --> 06:27.303
- Okay okay okay, so,
should I tell him the story?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.930
Alright alright alright,

06:29.013 --> 06:30.848
these college kids
brought a real, live bear

06:30.932 --> 06:32.141
to the baseball game...

06:32.225 --> 06:33.309
- Yeah, y'know,
just to be funny...

06:33.392 --> 06:35.895
- Which it was!
- Yeah it was! Hilarious...

06:35.978 --> 06:38.689
- Anyway. Until...
the hot dog guy came out...

06:38.773 --> 06:40.483
- Yeah. Y'know, weiners?
- Love 'em!

06:40.566 --> 06:42.944
- So, bear gets a whiff
of the weiners, right?

06:43.027 --> 06:44.445
And he just loses his mind!

06:44.529 --> 06:45.530
Just chases the poor weiner guy
right onto the field!

06:45.613 --> 06:48.449
- So Ray chases the bear
onto the field...

06:48.533 --> 06:49.784
- I did, I did...

06:49.867 --> 06:51.994
- And check this out,
he tackles the bear!

06:52.078 --> 06:54.497
- I tackled the bear!
I tackled a real live bear!

06:54.580 --> 06:58.000
The bear gets up...
He's like, rawrrr...

06:58.084 --> 07:00.837
and there's spit coming out
of his mouth!

07:00.920 --> 07:02.380
And he slashes at me,

07:02.463 --> 07:03.798
and his claws scrape
right across my face!

07:03.881 --> 07:05.716
- Oh my god!
- Yeah yeah yeah!

07:05.800 --> 07:07.051
And I guess he thought
that Ray was gonna go down

07:07.135 --> 07:09.345
or something like that!

07:09.428 --> 07:12.098
- But instead the bear goes,
"Rrrrrruhhh?!?"

07:12.181 --> 07:13.516
Which I guess in bear language
probably means...

07:13.599 --> 07:18.354
- "Uh oh! This human
is indestructible!"

07:18.437 --> 07:20.064
- Stupid bear had no idea!

07:20.148 --> 07:22.108
- We are smarter than bears!

07:22.191 --> 07:23.609
- We outsmarted the bear!

07:23.693 --> 07:24.735
- We are the smartest species!
- Yeah! That happened.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.738
- Wow!!!

07:27.822 --> 07:28.865
- Unreal man!

07:28.948 --> 07:30.032

08:05.818 --> 08:08.070
{\an8}where a local sweaty man
committed a crime,

08:08.154 --> 08:09.530
{\an8}just moments ago.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.490
- Wh... what?

{\an8}he ordered a Three-Ball
Nacho Sack,

08:26.839 --> 08:30.426
{\an8}and when he paid for it,
he handed me a coupon.

08:30.509 --> 08:32.720
{\an8}- But there was something
wrong that coupon,

08:32.803 --> 08:34.054
{\an8}wasn't there?

08:34.138 --> 08:38.683

15:34.266 --> 15:36.727
- Okay, what's going on?

15:36.810 --> 15:40.314
It's just...the only reason

15:40.397 --> 15:43.192
we ever even decided
to be crime-fighters...

15:43.275 --> 15:46.987
- Is 'cuz we wanted to be
exactly like you two!

15:47.071 --> 15:50.074
- We humble ourselves,
before you.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.706
- These...

You may rise before us.

16:10.344 --> 16:11.804
Look, guys,

16:11.887 --> 16:13.514
you know the whole
superhero thing, it's sort of--

16:13.597 --> 16:14.223
[ alarm rings]

16:14.306 --> 16:16.016
- Emergency.
- Yeah.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.893

a real emergency call!

16:17.976 --> 16:20.020
- I know I know,

16:22.147 --> 16:23.899
- I should probably take this.
If you'll excuse me.

16:23.982 --> 16:25.401
- Oh sure.
- 'Course.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.444
- You do your thing.
- Don't worry about us.

16:27.528 --> 16:28.237
- Oh my god.
- I know!

16:28.320 --> 16:29.321
- I don't know these guys.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.949
I don't know what to say.
Don't leave.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.039
So...

16:39.123 --> 16:42.251
"The Thumb Buddies."
Cool name.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.754
Nahhh, it's stupid.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.757
Well...Ah.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.885
How'd you guys come up with it?

16:51.969 --> 16:54.054
- Well, Mark and I used to be
dance instructors...

16:55.889 --> 16:58.016
- We taught the elderly
to dance.

16:58.100 --> 17:02.020
- But we never really
felt fulfilled, y'know?

17:02.104 --> 17:05.273
- We felt like
a couple a'nobodies.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.776
- But then, one night,
we were havin' dinner

17:07.859 --> 17:09.611
with my sister and she says:

17:09.694 --> 17:12.114
"You guyth..."

17:12.196 --> 17:15.159
- She talks with a lisp.
- She does.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.661
She says: "You guyth.
You don't have to be nobodieth.

17:17.744 --> 17:20.998
You can be thumbodieth."

17:21.080 --> 17:24.126
- And we were like...
thumbodieth.

17:24.209 --> 17:28.797
- Which sounded
like thumb buddies.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.425
So now that's who we are.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.510
The Thumb Buddies.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.888
- Bink.
- Bink.

17:35.971 --> 17:38.182
- So, I'm guessing
you two aren't married.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.809
- Nah. Just waiting
for the right girl!

17:40.893 --> 17:42.686
- That special someone.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.396

17:49.234 --> 17:51.528
- What?!? I thought
the cops had 'em!

17:51.612 --> 17:52.696
- They did, but he got away,

17:52.780 --> 17:53.822
and now we gotta
go get him again.

17:53.906 --> 17:54.406

- You gotta let us
come with you!

18:00.829 --> 18:02.164
- Oh...uhhh...

18:02.247 --> 18:03.832

thats a good idea.

18:03.916 --> 18:04.875
- I'll rub your
shoulders on the way!

18:41.995 --> 18:44.122
You sure that Stainless Steve
ran this way?

18:44.206 --> 18:45.874
- That's what the cop
in the police helicopter said.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.753
Maybe he...
Ohhh...

18:49.837 --> 18:52.548
Oh, this guy's hands
are like magic.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.883

19:16.864 --> 19:19.074
- C'mon. Please.

19:19.157 --> 19:21.076
If you guys'll just
let us do this...

19:21.159 --> 19:23.954
it'll make us feel like
we really did somethin'.

19:26.248 --> 19:30.085
- Like...
our lives have meaning.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.968
- Well...
All right.

19:38.051 --> 19:39.011
- Okay, you guys
