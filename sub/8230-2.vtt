ingredient... the mash.

Mix those together, end up
with about 10% alcohol

04:53.067 --> 04:54.899
that we can then distill
out to a higher proof.

04:54.900 --> 04:57.866
It's a process that's as old
as the appalachian mountains.

04:57.867 --> 05:00.532
But just how does it work?

05:00.533 --> 05:02.166
Adam:
At the bottom is a pot.

05:02.167 --> 05:05.532
It's filled with a mixture of
water and components of alcohol.

05:05.533 --> 05:08.699
At the bottom of that pot is
an electrical heating element

05:08.700 --> 05:11.099
which is heating
that mixture up.

05:11.100 --> 05:14.532
Now, when that heating element
reaches 172 degrees,

05:14.533 --> 05:16.232
which is the boiling point
of alcohol,

05:16.233 --> 05:18.066
but not yet
the boiling point of water,

05:18.067 --> 05:19.932
alcohol vapor starts to form.

05:19.933 --> 05:22.299
It moves up the column
on the left there,

05:22.300 --> 05:23.899
and then it starts to go down

05:23.900 --> 05:26.332
through the twisty copper
in the condenser.

05:26.333 --> 05:28.232
That water
that's in the condenser

05:28.233 --> 05:30.966
is cooling down
the gaseous alcohol

05:30.967 --> 05:33.266
until it comes out of the bottom

05:33.267 --> 05:36.232
as really nice
high-octane alcohol.

05:36.233 --> 05:37.899
Isn't that cool?

05:37.900 --> 05:42.099

Yep, and soon we should see
some ill-gotten grain alcohol.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.899
Well, actually,
not so ill-gotten.

05:44.900 --> 05:47.332
Normally, when we say,
"don't try this at home"

05:47.333 --> 05:48.966
there's a safety issue involved.

05:48.967 --> 05:51.266

It's illegal
to distill on your own.

and did it right.

need to be able to do this.

I'm sort of glass half full

what is it exactly

that is supposed to make
the still explode?

14:07.533 --> 14:10.432
Well, as the mash burns
and alcohol is produced,

14:10.433 --> 14:13.832
particulate matter can actually
build up inside this thing

14:13.833 --> 14:15.966
and cause a clog.

14:15.967 --> 14:17.466
Now, when that clog happens,

14:17.467 --> 14:20.366
all of a sudden you end up
with alcohol with no outlet,

14:20.367 --> 14:22.232

a pressure vessel.

Now, once we've eliminated
its outlet

it will find its own way out.

14:43.733 --> 14:45.632

we're going to answer

how bad will it be?

scenario still failure,

14:50.700 --> 14:53.332

the outlet.

for the worst-case scenario,

14:56.067 --> 14:58.432
I'm using 200-proof alcohol.

14:58.433 --> 15:00.432
That is pure alcohol.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.666
We are ready to go.

15:02.667 --> 15:05.899
Narrator: Distilling from
pure alcohol means more vapors

15:05.900 --> 15:09.232
and should mean more pressure
for the still.

within the still

15:27.600 --> 15:31.766
skyrockets to 500 degrees,
the room starts to cook.

somewhere in the piping
leading out of my still,

16:17.433 --> 16:19.299
there's a failure.

16:19.300 --> 16:21.666
We might not get a failure
of the actual vessel

16:21.667 --> 16:25.399
because it's just leaking
consistently in that space

16:25.400 --> 16:28.166
and feeding this fire.

16:28.167 --> 16:29.666
Adam's right.

16:29.667 --> 16:31.899
Because ethanol burns
with an invisible flame,

16:31.900 --> 16:33.766
it's hard to see.

16:33.767 --> 16:37.066

the burner and fueling the fire.

about putting it out?

the lack of an explosion

how the moonshiners do it.

to continue with this test.

less catastrophic and more,

than i was hoping for.

21:56.300 --> 21:57.866
Yeah,
yours still got a slow leak

21:57.867 --> 22:00.132
that was feeding a fire
underneath.

22:00.133 --> 22:01.766
Mine didn't have that problem.

22:01.767 --> 22:03.966
It had an internal
electric heating element.

22:03.967 --> 22:06.666
Right, so in theory,
your still could keep on leaking

no ready ignition source

would just keep building up

until you had the perfect
explosive fuel-air mix.

than you'd think.

If it doesn't ignite, nobody
wants to go near that thing.

22:47.400 --> 22:51.132
It's a dangerous thing,
so we must get ignition,

is pretty straightforward.

this is my alcohol

23:11.400 --> 23:12.966

alcohol from a liquid into a gas

and that's with a hot plate
and a pan.

to the floor,

29:22.467 --> 29:23.599
Oh, my god.
It's amazing!

29:23.600 --> 29:26.599
What was our time?

29:26.600 --> 29:28.832
You beat it by two seconds.

29:28.833 --> 29:31.099
Wait, we actually beat our time?

29:31.100 --> 29:32.132
Yeah, you did!

29:32.133 --> 29:33.366
Dude, that's amazing!

29:33.367 --> 29:34.632
That's insane!

29:34.633 --> 29:38.066
Narrator: Amazingly,
the moonshine outgunned the gas,

29:38.067 --> 29:42.166
but that's still not
a definitive result for kari.

29:42.167 --> 29:44.532
Kari: Moonshine
has done amazingly well,

29:44.533 --> 29:46.232
far beyond what i expected

29:46.233 --> 29:48.766
for both the speed
and for performance,

29:48.767 --> 29:50.466
but what I'd really like to see,

29:50.467 --> 29:52.566
what i really think
is gonna give moonshine a test

29:52.567 --> 29:54.299
is longevity.

29:54.300 --> 29:55.966
I want to see
a long moonshine run.

29:55.967 --> 29:58.099
I mean, moonshiners
are doing something illegal.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.566
They're not just gonna pull over
when the cops ask 'em.

30:00.567 --> 30:01.699
They're gonna keep going.

30:01.700 --> 30:02.932
They need to outrun them.

30:02.933 --> 30:04.466
This is a run-and-gun situation.

30:04.467 --> 30:07.266
I want to see if moonshine
can stand up

30:07.267 --> 30:10.032
to a real moonshine run
when in a car.

30:10.033 --> 30:11.866
Narrator:
Yep, coming up,

30:11.867 --> 30:13.832
the law catches up
with our moonshiner.

30:13.833 --> 30:14.767
Moonshiner!

30:14.768 --> 30:16.732
What the heck!
Let's get 'im.

30:16.733 --> 30:19.132
But will it be last orders
for the myth?

30:19.133 --> 30:22.133
Whoa, Nelly!

30:28.333 --> 30:30.166
Do not try what you are
about to see at home.

30:30.167 --> 30:34.000
We're
what you would call experts.

30:39.067 --> 30:40.466
Welcome back.

30:40.467 --> 30:42.032
In this episode, we've been
investigating mythical ways

30:42.033 --> 30:44.866
in which illegal alcohol stills
might meet their end,

30:44.867 --> 30:48.499
hopefully via a destructive
all-encompassing explosion.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.266
Jamie: That whole thing
is going down.

30:50.267 --> 30:52.466
I know it might look
like I'm standing

30:52.467 --> 30:53.866
in the aftermath
of a successful explosion,

30:53.867 --> 30:55.766
but in fact, we have to admit

30:55.767 --> 30:58.166
that this experimental setup
was a bit of a dud.

30:58.167 --> 31:00.732
Adam: The still
is totally destroyed.

31:00.733 --> 31:03.632
And so we built a second shed,
exactly the same as the first,

31:03.633 --> 31:05.099
except in this one
we will be investigating

31:05.100 --> 31:07.766
a totally different kind
of explosion.

31:07.767 --> 31:09.066
We will have Jamie's still
in here,

31:09.067 --> 31:11.066
and we're gonna pop a leak
in it.

31:11.067 --> 31:14.532
Now the hole in the middle
of it will be a perfect leak.

31:14.533 --> 31:16.899
When we have what we consider
enough vapor,

31:16.900 --> 31:18.599
we will introduce an open flame.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.166
Whoa!

31:20.167 --> 31:23.832
We consider this to be the
highest percentage possibility

31:23.833 --> 31:27.099
of yielding the type
of bye-bye shack fireball

31:27.100 --> 31:28.632
that we were looking for.

31:28.633 --> 31:30.132
Jamie:
Well, that ought to do it.

31:30.133 --> 31:34.666
Heat there, alcohol in there,
alcohol vapor out here.

31:34.667 --> 31:37.066
Boom.

31:37.067 --> 31:41.899
Narrator:
Well, boom, so long as the
moonshine to air ratio is right.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.366
Jamie:
Alcohol vapor becomes flammable

31:43.367 --> 31:46.532
between 3% and 19%
when combined with air.

31:46.533 --> 31:49.132
The ideal ratio is 7%, though,

31:49.133 --> 31:51.599
and so that's what we're
gonna be aiming for.

31:51.600 --> 31:54.166
But the thing is,
our alcohol sensors

31:54.167 --> 31:55.932
are proving to be
not so reliable,

31:55.933 --> 31:57.399
so what we're gonna have to do

31:57.400 --> 32:00.866
is measure the oxygen content
in the room...

32:00.867 --> 32:04.066
There's our sensor,
right there. Perfect.

32:04.067 --> 32:05.632
So we know that when we reach

32:05.633 --> 32:09.632
an oxygen concentration
of about 19.5%

32:09.633 --> 32:14.199
as opposed to its normal 20.9%
in the atmosphere,

32:14.200 --> 32:18.166
we'll have our ideal 7%
concentration of alcohol vapor,

32:18.167 --> 32:20.699
and that's gonna give us
our best shot.

32:20.700 --> 32:22.466
Narrator:
And to ensure ignition,

32:22.467 --> 32:24.599
they're using
their small-scale technique,

32:24.600 --> 32:27.832
time to soak our ignition source
in lighter fluid.

32:27.833 --> 32:30.799
Narrator: But that leaves
one key question.

32:30.800 --> 32:33.766
Jamie: How would this happen
in the real world?

32:33.767 --> 32:36.299
Let's say out moonshiner is
out of smokes

32:36.300 --> 32:39.066
and so he drives to town,
leaving the still operating

32:39.067 --> 32:41.899
not knowing that there's a leak
in it.

32:41.900 --> 32:43.866
He comes back
with his cigarettes,

32:43.867 --> 32:49.199
opens the door, lights one,
and up she goes.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.699
Adam: My prediction here
is pretty straightforward.

32:52.700 --> 32:54.666
You know, i like the overalls.

32:54.667 --> 32:56.932
They make carrying him
a lot easier.

32:56.933 --> 32:59.599
I think this thing's
gonna go ka-blum.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.766
I can't possibly do it
as loud as it will happen,

33:01.767 --> 33:04.932
but i think the visual cue
that it's going ka-blum

33:04.933 --> 33:09.600
is that this entire house is
gonna leap five feet in the air.

33:12.100 --> 33:15.066
Still's warming up, now we wait.

33:15.067 --> 33:16.466
Narrator: The wait begins,

33:16.467 --> 33:18.599
but will this be
the shining scenario

33:18.600 --> 33:22.766
that finally brings
the still house down?

33:22.767 --> 33:25.532
Adam:
Starting oxygen reading's 20.9,

33:25.533 --> 33:29.466
our butter zone
will be between 19.5 and 20.

33:29.467 --> 33:31.399
Narrator:
That's the explosive ratio,

33:31.400 --> 33:32.932
and inside the shack,

33:32.933 --> 33:36.599
the oxygen level
is slowly inching towards it.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.299
Oh, it's down to 20.3.

33:38.300 --> 33:40.266
We can't see the vapor,

33:40.267 --> 33:43.266
but it apparently
is displacing oxygen... 20.2.

33:43.267 --> 33:45.899
Narrator: The guys prepare
to bide their time

33:45.900 --> 33:48.966
as the ethanol fumes
fill their hut.

33:48.967 --> 33:50.799
Wow, things are happening
in there.

33:50.800 --> 33:52.666
Our feed over here
is getting fuzzy.

33:52.667 --> 33:54.866
But, after just five minutes,

33:54.867 --> 33:58.766
the air-to-moonshine mixture
hits their explosive goal.

33:58.767 --> 34:01.199
Jamie: It's 19.5.

34:01.200 --> 34:04.099
All right, that's
the ideal ratio. Shall we?

34:04.100 --> 34:05.432
Yeah, let's see what happens.

34:05.433 --> 34:09.666
Okay, here we go.
Moonshining still explosion.

34:09.667 --> 34:12.199
Well...
Ignition.

34:12.200 --> 34:16.832
[ Laughs ]
In three, two, one.

34:16.833 --> 34:17.867
[ Hissing ]

34:19.800 --> 34:22.066
Whoa!

34:22.067 --> 34:23.699
That was an explosion.

34:23.700 --> 34:25.132
That was beautiful!

34:25.133 --> 34:27.066
[ Both chuckle ]

34:27.067 --> 34:32.232
Yep, the still huffed and puffed
and blew the house down.

34:32.233 --> 34:34.766
That worked perfectly.

34:34.767 --> 34:36.299
That worked
absolutely perfectly.

34:36.300 --> 34:37.932
Let's go check out the damage.
Okay.

34:37.933 --> 34:40.866
Jamie: Ah, it looks like the
still's holding the building up.

34:40.867 --> 34:42.632
[ Both laugh ]

34:42.633 --> 34:44.566
Adam:
I wouldn't have expected that.

34:44.567 --> 34:46.666
And it did blow apart
the building,

34:46.667 --> 34:48.899
as well as lift it off
the foundation.

34:48.900 --> 34:52.066
It did, but not five feet like i
predicted, more like one foot.

34:52.067 --> 34:54.566
Adam:
Well, that was as awesome

34:54.567 --> 34:57.299
as our first experiment
was disappointing.

34:57.300 --> 35:01.566
We actually got a ka-blum
and a genuine whoomf

35:01.567 --> 35:03.566
and a failure
of our entire structure.

35:03.567 --> 35:06.166
The only thing holding
this building up at this point

35:06.167 --> 35:09.666
is the still that is inside it.

35:09.667 --> 35:12.066
What's interesting though,
to me,

35:12.067 --> 35:14.066
is that we didn't see a thing.

35:14.067 --> 35:16.932
That room was not cloudy,
there was nothing like

35:16.933 --> 35:20.099
any kind of teapot steam
coming out of the nozzle,

35:20.100 --> 35:21.732
which i kind of expected.

35:21.733 --> 35:22.899
So, you know,

35:22.900 --> 35:26.232
if you were a moonshiner
and you opened that door,

35:26.233 --> 35:28.066
you wouldn't have any idea
what was going on

35:28.067 --> 35:29.766
until it was too late.

35:29.767 --> 35:35.532
Narrator:
Which means, clearly this leaky
still scenario is confirmed.

35:35.533 --> 35:37.299
Jamie:
So, what does this tell us?

35:37.300 --> 35:38.732
Adam: Well,
i think first and foremost,

35:38.733 --> 35:40.166
we learned
that a homebuilt still

35:40.167 --> 35:42.732
does not a destructive
pressure vessel make.

35:42.733 --> 35:45.599
Yes, but a leak in a still
can create enough fumes

35:45.600 --> 35:47.066
to blow a building apart.

35:47.067 --> 35:50.199
Yeah, making moonshine
is a dangerous business.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.299
And we ain't even started
drinking it yet.

35:52.300 --> 35:54.333
Let's remedy that.
All right.

35:58.067 --> 35:59.799
Coming up.

35:59.800 --> 36:02.066
Tory: Calling all cars,
calling all cars.

36:02.067 --> 36:03.699
We are in hot pursuit.

36:03.700 --> 36:05.799
Whoa, Nelly!

36:05.800 --> 36:09.332
Can bootleggin' imahara
and his firewater fuel

36:09.333 --> 36:11.766
outrun the long arm of the law?

36:11.767 --> 36:16.367
Come on, moonshine,
you can do it!

36:25.100 --> 36:27.699
Every single thing
we investigate on "mythbusters"

36:27.700 --> 36:29.666
has to do
with a transfer of energy.

36:29.667 --> 36:33.166
From one state to another,
from one form to another,

36:33.167 --> 36:35.832
from one place to another,
often rapidly

36:35.833 --> 36:38.266
and hopefully
with disastrous results.

36:38.267 --> 36:40.066
So, just check this out,

36:40.067 --> 36:42.766
and watch
how the rapid combustion

36:42.767 --> 36:45.066
of all the alcohol fumes
in the shack

36:45.067 --> 36:46.299
causes it to expand.

36:46.300 --> 36:48.532
The in-rush of oxygen
causes fire

36:48.533 --> 36:50.732
to just appear
almost everywhere.

36:50.733 --> 36:54.199
The corona of flame
around the perimeter

36:54.200 --> 36:55.499
as the atmosphere

36:55.500 --> 36:58.766
is combining with the oxygen
and the gas fumes

36:58.767 --> 37:00.966
in order to set everything
on fire,

37:00.967 --> 37:03.932
as well as the total destruction
of the shed.

37:03.933 --> 37:05.213
This is the best part
of the job.

37:11.233 --> 37:14.433
Grant: Ah, thunderhill,
brings back memories, huh?

37:18.200 --> 37:19.732
You're going down, sucker.

37:19.733 --> 37:20.932
You're gonna have to catch me.

37:20.933 --> 37:22.299
Tory:
We're back at thunderhill,

37:22.300 --> 37:25.066
the same place
where we tested indy car myth,

37:25.067 --> 37:28.099
but this time we're playing
cops and moonshiners.

37:28.100 --> 37:31.332
We're trying to see if moonshine
will outperform gasoline,

37:31.333 --> 37:34.066
and so far, it looks like
they're pretty close.

37:34.067 --> 37:37.966
Kari:
You beat it by two seconds.

37:37.967 --> 37:41.766
But now it's time
for our next test... longevity.

37:41.767 --> 37:43.566
What we need to simulate here

37:43.567 --> 37:46.066
is a long car chase
down a windy road,

37:46.067 --> 37:49.066
and that's
why thunderhill is ideal.

37:49.067 --> 37:52.866
It's got twists, it's got turns,
it's got a straightaway.

37:52.867 --> 37:56.066
All right, we're about to start
our moonshine run experiment.

37:56.067 --> 37:57.466
This is how it's gonna go.

37:57.467 --> 37:59.699
Chief's really getting
on my nerves.

37:59.700 --> 38:00.633
[ Laughs ]

38:00.634 --> 38:02.266
Tory and i are gonna be waiting

38:02.267 --> 38:04.199
next to that billboard
right there.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.699
We are cops eating doughnuts.

38:05.700 --> 38:08.399
Keeps giving us these bum beats.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.432
Well,
there's plenty of doughnuts.

38:10.433 --> 38:13.066
Now, when Grant races by
in his moonshine vehicle,

38:13.067 --> 38:15.932
we are going to drop our
doughnuts and jump in the car.

38:15.933 --> 38:19.366
Grant's going to enter
the thunderhill raceway track.

38:19.367 --> 38:22.466
Now, when he does three laps,
that's ten miles.

38:22.467 --> 38:24.799
If in that time
we can catch up to him

38:24.800 --> 38:27.699
in our gas-powered vehicle,
then the myth is busted.

38:27.700 --> 38:30.632
If he makes it away from us,
it's confirmed.

38:30.633 --> 38:33.466
Narrator: And over on
the wrong side of the tracks...

38:33.467 --> 38:35.232
[ Engine turns over ]

38:35.233 --> 38:37.466
Yes! Good to go.

38:37.467 --> 38:38.967
[ Engine revs ]

38:40.900 --> 38:42.132
Moonshiners!

38:42.133 --> 38:44.932
What the heck!
Let's get 'em.

38:44.933 --> 38:48.732
Narrator: As Grant powers past
the police, the chase is on.

38:48.733 --> 38:50.732
Grant: Whoo-hoo!

38:50.733 --> 38:52.166
Here we go!

38:52.167 --> 38:55.966
Whoa, Nelly!

38:55.967 --> 38:59.532
Narrator: With just over
ten miles of high speed,

38:59.533 --> 39:02.699
high tailing,
hot pursuiting to go,

39:02.700 --> 39:06.066
this is the ultimate test
of endurance

39:06.067 --> 39:08.632
for the unconventional fuel.

39:08.633 --> 39:13.466
Grant: Come on, moonshine!
You can do it!

39:13.467 --> 39:17.299
Narrator:
Both drivers are giving it
everything they've got...

39:17.300 --> 39:19.932
Yeah!

39:19.933 --> 39:21.666
Whoo-hoo!

39:21.667 --> 39:22.966
Way to keep it together.

39:22.967 --> 39:25.667
Pushing their vehicles
to the limit.

39:27.633 --> 39:28.766
This is insane.

39:28.767 --> 39:31.532
He's performing
like he's driving on gas.

39:31.533 --> 39:33.832
The moonshine is unbelievable.

say, going into this test,

39:46.933 --> 39:49.332
i was a little dubious.

39:49.333 --> 39:53.466
They are never gonna catch me!

39:53.467 --> 39:55.199
As i went in, i started driving,

39:55.200 --> 39:58.199
and the first lap around
i was being really careful.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.832
And then, once i started
to gain confidence,

40:00.833 --> 40:03.932
i put the pedal to the metal.

40:03.933 --> 40:07.899
The moonshine performed

40:07.900 --> 40:11.166
just as well as the gasoline,
if not better.

the endurance test...

That is one smug moonshiner.

in my car officer.

40:40.800 --> 40:44.066
Well,
that was some fine driving, son.

40:44.067 --> 40:46.666
Wow, there's no way
we could catch up to you.

40:46.667 --> 40:49.666
Yeah, i mean, you were driving
as if you were driving with gas.

40:49.667 --> 40:50.832
You know what,

40:50.833 --> 40:52.799
there was no problems at all
here on the track.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.499
Are we confirming this myth?

40:54.500 --> 40:56.466
I can't believe it,
but i think we are.

40:56.467 --> 40:58.132
I think it's confirmed.

Moonshine, as good as gasoline.

Narrator: But, before you get
your hopes up about moonshine,

41:03.767 --> 41:06.566
kari has some fuel for thought.

41:06.567 --> 41:08.066
At this point, i feel like

41:08.067 --> 41:10.232
people are gonna start trying
to put moonshine in their car.

41:10.233 --> 41:11.866
That's not necessarily
a good idea.

41:11.867 --> 41:15.166
Cars are not made to have
alcohol running through them,

41:15.167 --> 41:18.866
and we used so much moonshine
compared to gasoline.

The gas mileage, not so good
when you're using moonshine.

in your cabinet and drink it.

What are we doing
back in the blueprint room?

41:33.867 --> 41:35.199
I thought we'd wrapped?

41:35.200 --> 41:38.699
Indeed we did, but we just got,
hot off the presses,

41:38.700 --> 41:40.432
some news that may change

41:40.433 --> 41:43.332
the origins of the story
of the exploding still.

What?

41:44.301 --> 41:46.232
Okay,
i want you to cast your mind

41:46.233 --> 41:48.232
back to the days
you were an illegal distiller.

41:48.233 --> 41:50.832
If you knew the cops
were coming, what would you do?

41:50.833 --> 41:53.366
I'd get the heck out of there.
Exactly!

41:53.367 --> 41:55.532
Illegal distillers
would try to remove

41:55.533 --> 41:57.799
any evidence
of their illegal operation,

41:57.800 --> 42:00.732
and they would do it in a way
that we are very familiar with.

42:00.733 --> 42:02.332
With explosives.
Exactly.

42:02.333 --> 42:04.832
So for a new finale
for this myth,

42:04.833 --> 42:06.199
we are going to use

42:06.200 --> 42:09.266
ye olde method
of destroying the evidence...
