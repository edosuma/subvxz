WEBVTT

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
[sighs]

01:08.000 --> 01:09.541
[clears throat]

01:15.583 --> 01:17.083
[kettle whistle echoes]

01:33.416 --> 01:36.125
[clears throat]
Welcome all and thanks for coming.

01:36.125 --> 01:40.166
I am not Bill T. Wilson,

01:40.166 --> 01:43.291
Bill T. Wilson is hoping
a prostitute named Candy

01:43.291 --> 01:45.583
will let him fuck her
if he brushes her hair.

01:46.375 --> 01:48.416
Tamerlane Usher...

01:49.666 --> 01:54.416
came up with the Goldbug lifestyle
to change the fucking...

02:20.708 --> 02:21.708
Hello?

02:28.750 --> 02:29.750
Bill?

02:38.625 --> 02:40.000
Hey!

02:42.708 --> 02:43.708
Bill?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.291
Uh...

02:48.291 --> 02:49.458
Guard?

02:51.875 --> 02:55.583
Guy? What the fuck is his name? Costner?

02:56.458 --> 02:57.458
Hello?

03:01.458 --> 03:02.458
Hey...

03:03.750 --> 03:05.333
If anyone is in here,

03:06.458 --> 03:12.750
there is a fucking bodyguard outside
who is authorized to use lethal force.

03:23.875 --> 03:25.291
[faint rustling]

04:06.125 --> 04:07.833
[gasps]

04:15.458 --> 04:16.541
Oh, Jesus.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.458
Oh, God.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.875
Tamerlane, you've got to sleep.

04:36.666 --> 04:37.666
Jesus.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.416
[sighs]

04:50.541 --> 04:52.833
Just go to sleep. Just go to sleep.

04:52.833 --> 04:58.458
Just go, please, just go to sleep.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.958
[Auguste] <i>I have a question. If I may.</i>

05:00.958 --> 05:04.041
You've told me about
Perry's conversations with his friends,

05:04.041 --> 05:05.958
Camille with her assistants,

05:05.958 --> 05:08.958
Leo chasing a cat alone in his loft,

05:08.958 --> 05:11.791
Victorine's weird experiences at work,
and now this.

05:11.791 --> 05:14.000
Tamerlane Usher alone in her bedroom.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.208
- I'm sorry, am I boring you?
- No, just, uh...

05:18.583 --> 05:19.875
I mean... [sniffs]

05:21.125 --> 05:23.041
I have to take it
with a grain of salt, right?

05:23.041 --> 05:26.791
There's no way you witnessed these events,
so what is this? Your best guess?

05:26.791 --> 05:29.125
- This is what happened.
- How could you know?

05:29.125 --> 05:30.166
Because they told me.

05:31.416 --> 05:33.750
- Before they died.
- No, not before.

05:40.166 --> 05:42.291
Oh, isn't it beautiful?

05:44.541 --> 05:45.750
It's fit for a queen.

05:46.291 --> 05:49.625
Queen Twosret, actually.

05:49.625 --> 05:51.375
Pharaoh of Egypt, 19th dynasty.

05:51.375 --> 05:56.166
Two giant sapphires were placed
in Twosret's head when she was mummified.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.500
In place of her eyes.

05:58.500 --> 06:02.500
To give her power
and sight in the afterlife.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.291
Now, that's how you send off a goddess.

06:09.625 --> 06:11.541
Priceless, they said.

06:14.291 --> 06:18.250
But you have to ask the right questions.
Not, "What do the sapphires cost?" but,

06:18.250 --> 06:20.750
"What does the Supreme
Council of Antiquities cost?"

06:20.750 --> 06:23.666
"What does the Coalition to Protect
Egyptian Antiquities cost?"

06:23.666 --> 06:26.000
"What does
the Minister of Antiquities cost?"

06:26.000 --> 06:28.041
"What does the Secretary General cost?"

06:28.916 --> 06:31.083
"What do the Egyptian
National Police cost?"

06:32.416 --> 06:35.041
Answer those questions. One at a time.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.458
And in just a few years,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.875
those priceless sapphires
are a birthday gift for my sister.

06:46.833 --> 06:48.291
I reached through time

06:49.750 --> 06:51.833
and ripped the eyes out of a goddess

06:53.000 --> 06:55.208
with my pocketbook and some patience.

06:57.583 --> 06:58.875
Does that make me a god?

07:03.458 --> 07:05.041
Don't all answer at once.

07:07.625 --> 07:08.791
[knock at door]

07:13.416 --> 07:14.416
Come in.

07:17.916 --> 07:22.708
Jesus Christ. Are you okay?
Have you been home yet?

07:22.708 --> 07:25.750
Pym told me to come straight here
before the press gets it.

07:25.750 --> 07:28.375
Haven't slept in my office
since the first Ligodone launch.

07:28.375 --> 07:30.375
Well, take a shower at least.

07:35.166 --> 07:37.208
That's not what I think it is.

07:37.208 --> 07:39.708
It's Fortunato property,
it's not for the police.

07:42.083 --> 07:43.750
Did you remove it yourself?

07:43.750 --> 07:46.791
I was going to have an intern do it,
but this was faster.

07:50.166 --> 07:52.958
I can't believe it.
I can't believe she got to them.

07:52.958 --> 07:56.333
I'm going to annihilate
that security company.

07:56.333 --> 07:59.708
- The guard was 30 feet away.
- There was no one in there.

07:59.708 --> 08:02.333
I saw it with my own eyes.
She did it herself.

08:02.333 --> 08:05.083
I saw Victorine push the knife
into her own heart.

08:05.916 --> 08:06.916
And no... [chuckles]

08:08.250 --> 08:10.875
No one helped her with her girlfriend.
That much was clear.

08:10.875 --> 08:14.208
Four deaths in a row is not a coincidence.

08:14.208 --> 08:17.250
We don't need to know how it's happening
to know it's happening.

08:17.250 --> 08:20.708
We are under attack
and if that doesn't snap you out of this,

08:20.708 --> 08:24.125
remember, Vic had a board seat.

08:26.458 --> 08:27.708
Now you're listening.

08:28.666 --> 08:31.375
Yes, brother dear,

08:31.375 --> 08:36.125
has it not occurred to you
that if these coincidences keep happening,

08:37.583 --> 08:40.083
that family firewall
you've always talked about

08:40.083 --> 08:43.916
is being dismantled one brick at a time?

08:43.916 --> 08:46.125
We could lose control of the board.

08:46.125 --> 08:49.583
That woman from the bar,
if we don't find her,

08:49.583 --> 08:52.375
if we don't stop her right fucking now,

08:53.166 --> 08:55.416
you won't have a family left.

08:55.416 --> 08:57.416
You won't have a company either.

08:57.416 --> 08:59.583
That's something
we can work with, at least.

08:59.583 --> 09:01.875
Yes, finally, something I can actually do.

09:04.666 --> 09:08.416
- What time is it?
- Sunrise, is what time it is.

09:08.416 --> 09:11.500
My hand will be around the throat
of every board member by lunch.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.750
Have Pym summon the troops
and spin up the circus,

09:13.750 --> 09:15.458
it's war with the shareholders.

09:16.125 --> 09:20.000
- The woman, Roderick.
- The board, Madeline, the board.

09:27.583 --> 09:28.583
Roddie?

09:33.708 --> 09:34.708
Hello?

09:51.208 --> 09:52.208
Hello?

09:54.083 --> 09:55.708
[man] <i>I've never seen
anything like this...</i>

09:55.708 --> 09:57.375
Hey, old man, it's me.

09:58.458 --> 10:00.291
You didn't come home last night. I'm just...

10:02.208 --> 10:04.875
I don't love that. Call me.

10:04.875 --> 10:07.666
Text me. Something.

10:14.791 --> 10:18.000
[man] <i>What do I tell their families
that they're counting on, this job...</i>

10:18.000 --> 10:20.875
Christ, breakfast of fucking champions,
isn't it?

10:20.875 --> 10:22.458
<i>We can't sustain this.</i>

10:22.458 --> 10:25.333
[reporter] <i>We'll keep you updated
as the story unfolds.</i>

10:25.333 --> 10:28.625
<i>Tragedy has once again
struck the prominent Usher family</i>

10:28.625 --> 10:30.583
<i>as the bodies
of Roderick Usher's daughter,</i>

10:30.583 --> 10:34.166
<i>Victorine Lafourcade,
and her partner Alessandra Ruiz</i>

10:34.166 --> 10:37.208
<i>were found deceased in their home
early this morning,</i>

10:37.208 --> 10:39.625
<i>following an apparent murder-suicide.</i>

10:39.625 --> 10:45.083
<i>Sources report Ruiz was dead hours before
Lafourcade took her own life</i>

10:45.083 --> 10:46.750
<i>in a gruesome scene.</i>

10:46.750 --> 10:50.000
- [Lenore] Oh, my God. Dad!
- [Frederick] What is it?

10:50.000 --> 10:51.791
<i>...by the couple's friends and colleagues...</i>

10:51.791 --> 10:52.958
Oh, my God.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.250
Jesus.

10:55.250 --> 10:56.375
<i>...and confusion...</i>

10:56.375 --> 10:59.791
- We'll have to go to another funeral.
- Dad, are we safe?

11:00.666 --> 11:03.250
Well, yes honey, you're... you're safe.

11:03.250 --> 11:07.083
You have a bodyguard at school.
You're completely safe, honey.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.625
<i>...Camille L'Espanaye, Napoleon Usher and...</i>

11:09.625 --> 11:15.083
Your aunt, she was a very ambitious woman.
I mean, very, very ambitious.

11:15.083 --> 11:17.583
Something like this was bound to happen.

11:17.583 --> 11:20.750
I didn't think she would hurt Ali, but it...

11:20.750 --> 11:22.666
Listen to me, this is important.

11:22.666 --> 11:27.458
Your Aunt Victorine, your Uncle Leo,
your Aunt Camille, your Uncle Perry...

11:28.458 --> 11:30.875
none of them were right.

11:30.875 --> 11:32.083
None of them.

11:33.000 --> 11:37.875
And they were also... Well,
they're not completely Ushers either.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.583
The only thing that matters now is Mommy.

11:42.916 --> 11:47.500
Honey, did you hear that?
Tragedy. Victorine is gone.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.291
Suicide.

11:49.291 --> 11:53.041
And she didn't just do herself in,
she took Ali with her.

11:53.041 --> 11:55.041
But it just shows to go you,

11:56.166 --> 11:59.125
you can never really know anyone.

11:59.791 --> 12:01.541
- [Morrie wheezing]
- Do you?

12:02.541 --> 12:03.500
Do you, honey?

12:05.083 --> 12:08.083
- Say goodbye, it's time for school.
- I want to stay with her.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.083
No, Mommy needs to settle in today.

12:13.250 --> 12:14.625
Are the doctors coming?

12:14.625 --> 12:16.250
The specialists you talked about?

12:17.208 --> 12:18.208
Soon.

12:19.458 --> 12:20.625
[Bill] Tam, I tried calling.

12:22.333 --> 12:23.333
I know.

12:23.333 --> 12:25.333
I wanted to make sure that... I mean, Vic.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.083
It's all over the news.
You weren't answering.

12:28.083 --> 12:30.250
Of course I've heard about Vic.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.583
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.375
That doesn't mean
that I need anything from you.

12:36.375 --> 12:39.375
I don't. We'll send you service details.

12:39.375 --> 12:42.000
In lieu of flowers, please leave your key.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.208
- Wow, you're sticking to this.
- I think I've been pretty clear.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.625
Tammy, this... this isn't the time...

12:50.083 --> 12:54.125
Let's set our shit aside for just a minute
and take stock of what has happened.

12:54.833 --> 12:55.791
You are not okay.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.583
You think you're tougher than this,
you're not.

12:58.583 --> 13:01.208
And you have not been okay
for a while now.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.625
But you're not alone in this.

13:04.458 --> 13:07.083
I am here with you. And I love you.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.166
I don't.

13:09.666 --> 13:10.875
So...

13:11.375 --> 13:13.875
Can we put this out of its misery, please?

13:13.875 --> 13:17.333
What did I do that was so egregious?
Can you even tell me that?

13:19.333 --> 13:21.583
Because I feel like all I've ever done is...

13:22.416 --> 13:24.250
try to work on our marriage.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.166
And all you've ever cared about
is our brand.

13:27.750 --> 13:28.833
"Our brand"?

13:30.458 --> 13:32.791
Read your prenup, Bill.

13:32.791 --> 13:35.333
You leave with the clothes
on your back, if that.

13:38.166 --> 13:39.375
I'm sorry.

13:40.916 --> 13:41.916
I'm sorry.

13:42.666 --> 13:45.375
I'm just having a really hard time here.

13:45.375 --> 13:47.666
And this thing, this Goldbug,

13:47.666 --> 13:50.708
it's different than anything else
that my family has ever done,

13:50.708 --> 13:53.958
and it is more important now than ever
that the world sees that we...

13:55.458 --> 13:59.041
That we're more than just Fortunato.
We're not just pill-pushers.

14:00.666 --> 14:03.583
We can be about health and about beauty.

14:03.583 --> 14:06.916
And the Usher name
is more than just Roderick and Madeline.

14:11.208 --> 14:12.666
And I'm scared, Bill.

14:25.750 --> 14:27.833
[Roderick] <i>As you know,
you've got to be with me</i>

14:27.833 --> 14:29.125
<i>when the smoke clears, Davis,</i>

14:29.125 --> 14:30.708
'cause it always clears,

14:30.708 --> 14:32.583
- and I'm always standing.
- [knock on door]

14:32.583 --> 14:34.875
You remember the other side of it.
Remember '96?

14:34.875 --> 14:37.458
- [Davis] <i>Mr. Usher...</i>
- They try to kill me, but I don't die.

14:37.458 --> 14:42.250
Heads fucking roll on the other side.
And Davis, hear me, I'm goddamn immortal.

14:42.250 --> 14:43.333
Come in!

14:46.375 --> 14:49.333
- Oh, my favorite girl.
- I'm so sorry, Grandpa.

14:51.416 --> 14:52.583
Thank you, Sarah, you can go.

14:52.583 --> 14:54.208
- Yes, sir.
- You too, bodyguard.

14:54.208 --> 14:55.625
Anybody tries anything, I'll...

14:55.625 --> 14:56.875
[clicks tongue]

14:59.125 --> 15:01.625
- Why aren't you in school?
- Are you kidding?

15:02.916 --> 15:05.750
They excused me.
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.041
Everybody's...

15:08.875 --> 15:10.166
Why is this happening?

15:11.166 --> 15:12.458
Life is insane.

15:13.458 --> 15:15.000
It is madness.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.833
The sooner you understand that,
the better off you'll be.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.000
I'm worried, Grandpa.

15:21.416 --> 15:22.916
The world might not be safe...

15:23.875 --> 15:25.916
but listen to me, and listen carefully.

15:26.916 --> 15:30.166
- I won't let anything happen to you.
- I'm not worried about me.

15:30.166 --> 15:31.666
I'm worried about my dad.

15:31.666 --> 15:34.375
Something's off with him.

15:34.375 --> 15:36.375
Well, sometimes things are just...

15:37.333 --> 15:38.291
off.

15:40.666 --> 15:42.333
Reality's not what it used to be.

15:45.291 --> 15:46.541
<i>All that we see</i>

15:47.541 --> 15:48.541
<i>Or seem</i>

15:49.708 --> 15:53.000
<i>Is but a dream within a dream</i>

15:56.166 --> 15:57.625
For example...

16:00.875 --> 16:02.000
Do you see them too?

16:08.250 --> 16:09.375
Daydreams.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.291
'Cause I'm not sleeping at night,
but that's...

16:14.333 --> 16:15.541
that's an edge.

16:18.708 --> 16:21.375
<i>As those who dream by day
Are cognizant of many things</i>

16:21.375 --> 16:23.583
<i>Which escape those
Who dream only by night</i>

16:25.708 --> 16:29.625
- Grandpa, are you okay?
- I am. I'm fine.

16:29.625 --> 16:32.166
I'm just... [sighs]

16:37.125 --> 16:38.333
It's been quite a week.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.291
That's Fortunato property.

16:45.291 --> 16:46.250
That too.

16:49.875 --> 16:52.708
[officer] Sergeant, do we have to listen
to this asshole?

16:54.041 --> 16:56.416
[sergeant] We're ready for you in here,
Mr. Pym.

16:57.083 --> 17:00.583
Hard drives, laptops,
anything digital is ours.

17:00.583 --> 17:01.916
The D.A. has assured me

17:01.916 --> 17:05.041
that if you find anything relevant
to our case on those devices,

17:05.041 --> 17:06.708
you'll turn it in.

17:07.708 --> 17:08.791
You're not serious.

17:09.791 --> 17:13.291
You telling me those have fuck-all
to do with proprietary Fortunato shit?

17:16.625 --> 17:18.375
See something of interest, Mr. Pym?

17:21.083 --> 17:23.250
You'll conclude your business here
by 7:00.

17:24.083 --> 17:26.541
Mr. Usher welcomes you
into his daughter's home,

17:26.541 --> 17:28.500
but his patience isn't endless.

17:29.666 --> 17:31.375
Stay out of the other rooms.

17:33.291 --> 17:35.666
Cancel my afternoon,
I've got to check something out.

17:35.666 --> 17:38.916
Oh, and I'm having Richard Parker
for dinner, so...

17:39.958 --> 17:41.291
tell him I might be late.

17:41.291 --> 17:42.375
Yes, sir.

17:48.208 --> 17:49.208
Dad!

17:50.416 --> 17:51.958
Dad, are you here?

17:53.250 --> 17:55.541
- Hey there.
- Oh. Fuck it. Fuck.

18:00.666 --> 18:01.791
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

18:01.791 --> 18:04.500
- Um, no, thank you.
- Sorry.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.041
Have you seen my father?

18:06.041 --> 18:08.250
He hasn't answered his phone all morning.

18:08.250 --> 18:11.541
I know. He sure won't, right?
I've been calling all day.

18:11.541 --> 18:13.958
Closest I got was Crystal,
you know his secretary?

18:13.958 --> 18:15.375
Crystal. Course you do.

18:15.375 --> 18:17.375
She said he was okay. Not to worry.

18:17.375 --> 18:19.041
Crisis mode. All that.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.041
Victorine. Horrible.

18:22.750 --> 18:23.875
It's always the same though.

18:23.875 --> 18:27.708
He doesn't really talk to me
most of the time. It's, uh...

18:29.250 --> 18:30.750
You ever been alone in this house?

18:31.625 --> 18:35.833
It's fucking huge.
A lot of stairs. Quite cold.

18:36.625 --> 18:40.583
Makes me feel small, I guess.
No one ever sees me here.

18:41.541 --> 18:44.458
No one is here in general.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.208
I'm rambling. I'm sorry.

18:50.541 --> 18:53.541
I'm sorry is what I meant to say.

18:54.291 --> 18:56.083
I'm sorry about Victorine.

18:57.208 --> 18:59.333
And Camille. And Leo.

19:00.708 --> 19:04.583
And Perry. All of it. All this madness.

19:05.291 --> 19:07.458
It's just weird to me.

19:08.208 --> 19:10.750
I guess all these terrible things and...

19:11.791 --> 19:14.083
I thought,
that's when people come together.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.500
But we've never been further apart.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.041
I'm sorry...

19:25.500 --> 19:27.916
that he doesn't answer his phone.

19:29.041 --> 19:31.750
It's not you. It's all of us.
It always has been.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.333
I know.

19:34.708 --> 19:36.791
I've never had much in the way of family.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
I thought when we...

19:40.250 --> 19:43.250
got together, "Well,
his family's fucking huge, isn't it?"

19:46.083 --> 19:47.083
Just to...

19:48.166 --> 19:49.541
be part of a group.

19:51.208 --> 19:52.791
Be really part of something, you know?

19:54.750 --> 19:55.916
[clears throat]

19:55.916 --> 19:57.750
Silly, aren't I? [chuckles softly]

19:58.916 --> 20:01.750
Just tell him I came by
if you talk to him before I do.

20:13.708 --> 20:15.416
[Madeline] <i>No, that's not good enough.</i>

20:15.416 --> 20:18.250
<i>I need something
that will impress the board.</i>

20:18.250 --> 20:20.250
And I need it now.

20:20.250 --> 20:23.041
One thing about the board,
they love the pills,

20:23.041 --> 20:24.958
but they love an algorithm even more.

20:24.958 --> 20:29.958
We have predictive market modeling
up and running at 74% accuracy on the SET.

20:29.958 --> 20:32.291
Thailand. Mmm. Congratulations.

20:32.291 --> 20:35.666
That's like getting a "B"
in an easy class.

20:35.666 --> 20:38.083
What about the DOW, Japan?

20:38.083 --> 20:39.916
Hell, fucking Germany.

20:39.916 --> 20:43.750
Those markets are much more volatile
and our algorithm is still learning.

20:43.750 --> 20:46.125
Okay, how about weather patterning?

20:46.125 --> 20:49.625
The Doppler algorithm
was performing well last month.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.583
Put a little icing on that.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.458
It's doing better than expected,

20:53.458 --> 20:55.583
but not ready for the board, Ms. Usher.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.375
What am I paying you people for?

20:57.375 --> 21:01.500
Look, this science, yes, it's about
predicting political landscapes,

21:01.500 --> 21:04.791
preventing environmental catastrophe,
saving entire economies,

21:04.791 --> 21:10.833
but if we can crack consciousness mapping,
it's about living for fucking ever.

21:10.833 --> 21:13.041
- Leave now. Thank you.
- [phone vibrating]

21:16.666 --> 21:17.666
Arthur.

21:17.666 --> 21:20.000
- Things are escalating.
- <i>How so?</i>

21:21.083 --> 21:23.625
I found a patient file at Vic's.

21:23.625 --> 21:25.583
<i>There was a photograph attached.</i>

21:26.750 --> 21:28.541
- <i>It was her.</i>
- Her?

21:29.750 --> 21:31.875
<i>There was an address on the file.</i>

21:31.875 --> 21:34.041
Now you're talking. You need to get there.

21:34.625 --> 21:35.666
I'm here now.

21:36.875 --> 21:38.291
You were absolutely correct.

21:39.125 --> 21:40.291
This is intentional.

21:41.250 --> 21:42.625
You have been targeted.

21:43.541 --> 21:47.166
And this woman knows
we are trying to find her.

21:48.958 --> 21:50.166
What makes you say that?

21:55.916 --> 21:56.916
[Auguste] <i>Here?</i>

21:58.500 --> 22:01.083
- She used this address on her file?
- [Roderick] That's right.

22:01.083 --> 22:03.666
- Did he go inside?
- Oh, yes, he did.

22:04.166 --> 22:05.166
And did he find her?

22:06.625 --> 22:08.666
How much do you know about Arthur Pym?

22:10.875 --> 22:13.416
I expect he's the kind of man
you call if you...

22:15.125 --> 22:18.166
I don't know,
accidentally kill a prostitute

22:18.166 --> 22:19.583
and need to dismember the corpse.

22:19.583 --> 22:23.250
[laughs] No.
No, he's not nearly that boring.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.208
You remember the Transglobe Expedition?

22:31.041 --> 22:33.666
'79 to '82. Circumnavigated the globe.

22:34.916 --> 22:38.333
U.K. to the South Pole to the North Pole
and home again. Round the world.

22:38.333 --> 22:39.416
I remember.

22:40.208 --> 22:44.166
- One hundred thousand miles.
- Across the Sahara.

22:44.916 --> 22:47.333
Swamps and jungles of Mali
and the Ivory Coast,

22:47.333 --> 22:51.666
unexplored crevasse fields in Antarctica.
The Northwest Passage...

22:51.666 --> 22:53.958
The graveyard
of so many famous adventurers.

22:53.958 --> 22:56.958
And then, into the hazards
of the Arctic Ocean...

22:56.958 --> 22:59.416
- I remember it, Roderick.
- Arthur was there.

23:02.625 --> 23:03.833
He was barely 25.

23:05.291 --> 23:06.833
He put law school on hold

23:06.833 --> 23:10.416
to elbow his way onto the expedition
and he saw the fucking world.

23:11.500 --> 23:14.791
While you and I were dicking around
with our petty little dramas,

23:14.791 --> 23:17.583
and we were digging in the basement
at Fortunato,

23:17.583 --> 23:18.708
Arthur Gordon Pym

23:18.708 --> 23:21.750
was bending the planet over
and taking his piece.

23:23.958 --> 23:25.416
The things he saw...

23:26.875 --> 23:29.791
And he'll talk about them too.
To a point.

23:31.458 --> 23:32.750
Always stops telling it...

23:33.833 --> 23:35.333
as he gets to the North Pole.

23:36.625 --> 23:38.416
Used to be a fun game
when the kids grew up,

23:38.416 --> 23:40.541
trying to finish Arthur's story.

23:43.166 --> 23:44.958
I like to think he killed someone.

23:46.458 --> 23:48.416
I like to think he's eaten human flesh.

23:48.416 --> 23:51.666
I like to think he took a piss
on the tip-top of the world.

23:52.208 --> 23:53.291
A guy can dream.

23:53.291 --> 23:55.250
[laughs] He told my kids...

23:56.791 --> 23:58.666
that the Earth was hollow.

23:58.666 --> 24:00.875
And I don't even know if he was lying.

24:00.875 --> 24:02.458
He was lying.

24:03.708 --> 24:06.208
He told Tammy the Earth was hollow...

24:07.833 --> 24:12.208
and that he found an island
at the top of the world, that he called

24:13.500 --> 24:14.833
Ultima Thule.

24:15.541 --> 24:18.291
And that it was the realm of beings
who lived...

24:20.583 --> 24:22.083
beneath us, out of time.

24:22.833 --> 24:24.416
And out of space.

24:27.625 --> 24:28.625
Cute.

24:29.416 --> 24:32.375
We didn't send a private investigator
to find that woman.

24:32.375 --> 24:34.750
We didn't send the police.
We didn't send a hitman.

24:34.750 --> 24:36.208
We didn't send a mercenary.

24:38.833 --> 24:40.833
We sent Arthur Gordon Pym.

24:44.041 --> 24:45.208
Of course he found her.

24:50.625 --> 24:51.958
But not that day.

24:54.083 --> 24:56.958
Funny you mention
going through the basement of Fortunato.

24:57.750 --> 25:01.750
That's why I remember
seeing the expedition, in a way.

25:02.750 --> 25:06.250
They landed back in England in '82.

25:07.333 --> 25:09.041
I watched most of it on TV.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.750
I remember it well, because...

25:12.375 --> 25:14.541
I was unemployed at the time.

25:14.541 --> 25:15.708
Thanks to you.

25:15.708 --> 25:18.375
Oh, don't be bitter, Auggie.

25:20.916 --> 25:23.333
At this point,
isn't it all just water under the...

25:59.916 --> 26:02.583
Oh, please. Please, sweetie, stop.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.083
[bone cracks]

26:13.625 --> 26:14.625
[Auguste] Roderick?

26:15.916 --> 26:16.958
Roderick?

26:17.833 --> 26:19.416
[gasping]

26:25.333 --> 26:26.333
It's all right.

26:30.041 --> 26:32.625
- [Auguste] Thanks for doing this.
- It's risky.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.750
[Auguste] Yes, it is. I won't deny that.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.500
What happens if he gets caught?

26:36.500 --> 26:39.625
I hate to say, it kind of depends
on what he gives us.

26:39.625 --> 26:43.000
Whatever I give you, whatever it is,
you have to take him down.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.250
Because no matter how badly we hurt him,

26:45.250 --> 26:47.916
if we don't kill him,
he'll kill us both, you know that.

26:47.916 --> 26:50.750
You get me what I need
and he will go down.

26:54.500 --> 26:57.708
Tell me again.
What do you need specifically?

26:58.291 --> 27:00.000
[Auguste] I wrote it all down for you.

27:01.083 --> 27:02.333
Patient records, sure,

27:02.333 --> 27:04.916
but I'm more interested
in the consent for care forms,

27:04.916 --> 27:07.875
internal memos,
anything that has the name Brevit on it.

27:08.625 --> 27:13.041
And anything that has your signature on it
that you know you didn't sign.

27:13.041 --> 27:14.125
Those are bulletproof.

27:14.708 --> 27:19.291
You testify that they are forged
and each piece of paper is a felony.

27:19.291 --> 27:22.541
There's lots down there.
It could take hours to copy everything.

27:22.541 --> 27:25.750
To be clear,
I'm putting my neck out there.

27:25.750 --> 27:29.291
- Into a fucking guillotine.
- My neck's right next to yours.

27:30.833 --> 27:34.000
We can't do this.
You'll be breaking the law.

27:34.791 --> 27:36.958
They are breaking the law.

27:36.958 --> 27:39.750
We're just making copies of their crimes.

27:39.750 --> 27:42.375
- And then what? You testify?
- Yes.

27:42.375 --> 27:45.166
- But it's complicated.
- No, I...

27:46.291 --> 27:49.125
Roderick, this is risking
everything we have.

27:50.458 --> 27:51.458
Tell me...

27:52.208 --> 27:54.958
it's not just a vendetta
against your awful boss.

27:55.916 --> 27:57.041
Or about your dad.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.125
Tell me it's worth it.

27:59.750 --> 28:02.708
Tell me you know the risk
and I'll be there with you.

28:02.708 --> 28:05.041
I'll back you up. Just tell me.

28:05.041 --> 28:08.166
This is worth the risk.

28:13.166 --> 28:14.375
Then I'm proud of you.

28:42.791 --> 28:44.625
[objects clatters]

28:47.500 --> 28:48.500
Hello?

29:23.416 --> 29:24.583
[sighs in relief]

29:54.625 --> 29:55.875
[Madeline] Look at the address.

29:56.916 --> 29:58.291
[Roderick] Doesn't make any sense.

29:58.875 --> 30:00.291
We're past that now.

30:00.291 --> 30:03.791
Look. You can't deny your own eyes.

30:03.791 --> 30:06.833
I watched Vic commit suicide
with my own eyes.

30:06.833 --> 30:09.708
Was there anything in her system?
Any drugs whatsoever?

30:09.708 --> 30:11.750
There was no one else in the apartment.

30:11.750 --> 30:14.750
Look at the fucking file.
She was there at every turn.

30:15.250 --> 30:18.041
[Roderick] What do you expect me to do?
Huh? I mean, Arthur?

30:18.041 --> 30:19.666
What do we have on this woman?

30:19.666 --> 30:23.958
Some pictures, a bogus address,
but what did she do to them?

30:23.958 --> 30:26.041
I don't know. Yet.

30:26.708 --> 30:29.333
But you need to bear with me.

30:31.041 --> 30:33.916
I tracked down that bar
you mentioned, Madeline.

30:33.916 --> 30:38.041
Only the location you gave me isn't a bar.
It was never a bar.

30:38.041 --> 30:41.041
And it's been vacant since 1975.

30:41.041 --> 30:44.416
I must have the address wrong.
It's been 40 years.

30:45.625 --> 30:49.250
Now, you two said you walked to this bar
from Fortunato that night?

30:49.250 --> 30:50.500
We did.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.333
Seems unlikely
you'd walk more than five miles.

30:53.333 --> 30:55.166
Five minutes, more like.

30:55.166 --> 30:57.541
I looked at every bar
in a five-mile radius

30:57.541 --> 31:00.500
of Fortunato going back to 1975.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.500
I accounted for every female bartender

31:02.500 --> 31:04.666
at every bar that fit that criteria,
and nothing.

31:05.750 --> 31:09.041
I've been running her images
through a facial recognition sweep.

31:09.041 --> 31:12.250
- No hits on law enforcement.
- See? This is going nowhere.

31:12.250 --> 31:15.375
But I tapped into
Madeline's technology department,

31:15.375 --> 31:17.291
brought in their research algorithm,

31:17.291 --> 31:19.666
combed the Internet, massive image search

31:19.666 --> 31:23.166
and, in conjunction
with our facial recognition...

31:25.541 --> 31:28.125
- [Madeline] Oh, wait, that's--
- [Arthur] David Koch.

31:28.875 --> 31:30.250
Seven years ago.

31:30.250 --> 31:31.541
[Roderick] Wait, she...

31:32.166 --> 31:34.458
she works for the Toxic Twins?

31:34.458 --> 31:36.666
I always got along with those fuck-nuts.

31:38.625 --> 31:40.125
And Zuckie too?

31:42.250 --> 31:46.166
- That's Gina.
- [Arthur] Gina Rinehart. Mining magnate.

31:46.166 --> 31:47.708
Climate Denial Dundee.

31:47.708 --> 31:51.708
You remember when she tried to make a case
for $2-a-day pay, no?

31:52.458 --> 31:54.250
She's a trip. She's a great singer too.

31:54.958 --> 31:56.875
[Arthur] These were taken in 2011.

31:56.875 --> 31:59.875
[Roderick] So she's a stalker.
She stalks important people.

32:01.708 --> 32:02.708
[Roderick sighs]

32:04.833 --> 32:06.041
Oh, wait.

32:09.083 --> 32:10.583
This is from the '80s.

32:14.958 --> 32:15.958
[Arthur] Gettys.

32:20.208 --> 32:22.708
That's Prescott Bush, 1944.

32:26.125 --> 32:27.416
Randolph Hearst.

32:29.250 --> 32:30.416
Rockefellers.

32:32.041 --> 32:34.916
Doherty. Vanderbilts.

32:37.333 --> 32:38.625
And this one.

32:41.083 --> 32:44.875
That's John Francis Queeny.
He founded Monsanto.

32:45.916 --> 32:49.166
- In 1901.
- Bullshit. This is bullshit.

32:50.333 --> 32:51.416
Roderick.

32:51.416 --> 32:55.125
It's Photoshop. She sprinkled
bogus images of herself online.

32:55.125 --> 32:58.083
- She knows we're looking. It's a prank.
- Roderick, stop it.

32:58.083 --> 32:59.583
Oh, she's... [scoffs]

32:59.583 --> 33:02.041
Stop. It's a goose chase.
She's spinning your wheels.

33:02.041 --> 33:04.333
I could make a hundred photos
just like that.

33:04.333 --> 33:05.416
Give me three minutes,

33:05.416 --> 33:07.625
I'll make a photo
of Pym blowing Elon Musk.

33:07.625 --> 33:10.500
Don't be such a fucking child.

33:10.500 --> 33:13.625
This is the same woman, Roderick.

33:13.625 --> 33:17.666
Remember what happened that night.
Remember what she said.

33:17.666 --> 33:20.000
You're the COO
of a Fortune 100 corporation

33:20.000 --> 33:22.750
and you're talking like a crazy person.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.166
You remember that conversation,
I know you do.

33:25.166 --> 33:27.583
- We were out of our minds, Madeline.
- Maybe.

33:27.583 --> 33:32.041
<i>Men have called me mad
But the question is not yet settled</i>

33:32.041 --> 33:36.208
<i>As to whether madness is or is not
The loftiest intelligence</i>

33:36.791 --> 33:38.166
[Arthur] If I may.

33:39.041 --> 33:44.625
The metadata confirms these images
have been online for years.

33:44.625 --> 33:47.250
So for someone to fake these photographs,

33:47.250 --> 33:50.750
we're looking at deep state,
black-ops level cyber manipulation.

33:50.750 --> 33:52.791
I've never seen anything like this.

33:52.791 --> 33:58.208
CIA, NSA. No, it seems impossible,
so obviously they want us to think it is.

33:59.083 --> 34:02.375
They want us to have
this exact conversation.

34:02.375 --> 34:05.500
The question is, why?

34:05.500 --> 34:08.250
Or it is exactly what it looks like.

34:08.833 --> 34:10.375
I need the room, please.

34:10.958 --> 34:12.000
You may have it.

34:20.583 --> 34:23.500
[door opens, closes]

34:30.458 --> 34:31.458
<i>Look out!</i>

34:33.375 --> 34:35.333
- [woman] <i>Daddy!</i>
- [man] <i>It's all right now.</i>

34:35.333 --> 34:36.750
<i>It's all right.
You all right?</i>

34:36.750 --> 34:38.375
- <i>Don't worry.</i>
- <i>It's all my fault.</i>

34:38.375 --> 34:39.958
<i>It's not your fault, dear.</i>

34:39.958 --> 34:41.833
- <i>I'm so sorry.
- We're all safe now.</i>

34:45.166 --> 34:48.416
Okay. What now? Another movie, or a show?

34:54.166 --> 34:57.500
- Go ahead.
- Mo-vie.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.333
Okay. Now we're talking.

35:00.625 --> 35:03.500
Just let me know when we hit something
you want to see.

35:03.500 --> 35:04.625
Honey.

35:05.666 --> 35:09.958
Love you.

35:12.916 --> 35:13.958
She's talking.

35:15.125 --> 35:18.125
- What?
- This afternoon she wasn't even blinking.

35:18.125 --> 35:20.583
I thought something was wrong,
she wouldn't even twitch,

35:20.583 --> 35:21.625
now she's moving again.

35:21.625 --> 35:23.916
- More than ever, she's talking even.
- Really?

35:23.916 --> 35:26.625
- We've got to tell the doctor.
- We should do.

35:26.625 --> 35:29.500
- Hey, did the doctor come today?
- Not today.

35:31.208 --> 35:32.208
Where's...

35:33.166 --> 35:35.125
I mean, you said about the specialists.

35:35.125 --> 35:38.375
Full-time care?
But, well, I haven't seen anybody.

35:38.375 --> 35:40.875
Well, like you said,
she's doing much better now,

35:40.875 --> 35:42.541
so they come when they're needed.

35:43.625 --> 35:46.500
- Are they coming tomorrow?
- I'm sure they are.

35:46.500 --> 35:52.791
Listen, I don't want you to worry about
doctors and specialists and whatever.

35:52.791 --> 35:54.625
Your mom's going to get what she needs,

35:54.625 --> 35:57.666
and who better
to take care of her than us, right?

35:57.666 --> 35:58.750
I mean...

35:58.750 --> 36:00.000
[sniffs]

36:00.000 --> 36:03.375
we always have been
so good to her, haven't we?

36:04.458 --> 36:05.458
Yeah.

36:06.250 --> 36:08.541
It's just because you'd said
about the specialists...

36:08.541 --> 36:09.958
Don't you worry about it.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.500
I'm sorry.

36:14.833 --> 36:15.833
About everything.

36:16.791 --> 36:18.208
I know you must be...

36:18.208 --> 36:21.000
- I can't imagine how you're feeling.
- I'm good, sweetie.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.625
I mean, Aunt Vic, she's...

36:22.625 --> 36:25.000
You understand
that you're perfectly safe, right?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.708
I know the family's... They're going crazy.

36:27.708 --> 36:29.125
They're doing...

36:29.125 --> 36:31.208
Self-destructing all over the place.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.208
But you're going to be okay.

36:36.541 --> 36:37.625
I'll make sure of it.

36:41.666 --> 36:43.041
Yes!

36:44.583 --> 36:46.708
[ECG beeping]

36:46.708 --> 36:48.291
[Morrie wheezing]

36:49.333 --> 36:50.250
[snorts]

36:52.750 --> 36:53.958
I heard you're talking.

36:54.541 --> 36:55.583
Freddie.

36:55.583 --> 36:58.750
I think it's neat that you can talk again.
Don't get me wrong.

37:02.291 --> 37:05.083
It's just, what's the point?

37:05.083 --> 37:06.625
Because if you're talking...

37:07.750 --> 37:08.750
you're lying.

37:10.041 --> 37:11.833
We can do without the lies, Morrie.

37:11.833 --> 37:12.916
No.

37:14.750 --> 37:17.291
[beeping intensifies]

37:20.250 --> 37:22.791
How long were you fucking him?

37:26.125 --> 37:27.125
No.

37:27.125 --> 37:28.416
[wheezing]

37:28.416 --> 37:29.500
No.

37:30.541 --> 37:32.583
No. No.

37:33.541 --> 37:38.041
- Enough. Okay? Enough.
- No.

37:39.916 --> 37:43.708
Freddie. Freddie. Freddie, no.

37:43.708 --> 37:47.083
15cc lasted, what,
about six hours last time?

37:48.416 --> 37:51.208
Ah, this stuff is the real deal.

37:53.791 --> 37:57.083
And you're aware the whole time, right?

37:58.041 --> 37:59.750
It's important that you are aware.

38:00.500 --> 38:02.916
You can still see me, hear me.

38:08.458 --> 38:09.625
This stuff.

38:10.541 --> 38:14.791
It's the only stuff I know
that can do that this well.

38:16.791 --> 38:18.125
You still see me, right?

38:21.125 --> 38:22.083
Good.

38:23.250 --> 38:25.250
Let's see how long this dose lasts, huh?

38:50.458 --> 38:52.166
[Madeline] I nearly spat out my tea

38:52.166 --> 38:54.458
when your secretary
told me where you were.

38:55.416 --> 38:57.541
She says you've been
coming down here a lot.

38:58.750 --> 39:00.625
What are you doing down here, anyway?

39:01.166 --> 39:02.041
Listening.

39:03.833 --> 39:05.875
Goldbug is starting.

39:06.583 --> 39:07.583
[Roderick] Mmm-hmm.

39:09.833 --> 39:10.833
You should be there.

39:12.541 --> 39:15.500
If not for her, for the company.
We are drowning.

39:16.375 --> 39:19.166
- The trial. The deaths.
- It's a waste of time.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.416
Why the hell is she doing it today anyway?

39:24.416 --> 39:25.791
Well, because she has to.

39:28.750 --> 39:31.000
Because right now,
she seems more interested

39:31.000 --> 39:34.750
in pulling this family out of its nosedive
than you do.

39:35.791 --> 39:38.541
- And you should back her up.
- I'll be up in a minute.

39:40.291 --> 39:41.291
Do you hear that?

39:43.583 --> 39:44.666
Hear what?

39:48.875 --> 39:49.833
Bells.

39:59.833 --> 40:04.875
Shut your mouth, get your shit together.
The fuck is wrong with you?

40:05.416 --> 40:07.750
You know as well as I do
what's happening here.

40:07.750 --> 40:10.000
Stop playing stupid.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.833
I don't know anything about anything.

40:16.625 --> 40:21.375
My heart is dying,
my brain is dying, I don't...

40:22.875 --> 40:26.875
I don't know for a fact
if you're even here right now.

40:27.416 --> 40:31.083
Okay, you can hide behind
this diagnosis all you want.

40:31.083 --> 40:35.500
But right now, I need you
to pull your head out of your ass

40:35.500 --> 40:39.583
for Tamerlane and Frederick,
for Fortunato, and for me.

40:40.458 --> 40:44.541
- Your daughter needs you.
- She's fine.

40:46.041 --> 40:49.291
She's surrounded. How many people
are up there anyway? A hundred?

40:53.333 --> 40:55.500
[indistinct chatter]

41:08.208 --> 41:09.250
Oh, fucking hell.

41:12.916 --> 41:16.333
Oh, that's enough caffeine,
you are shaking already.

41:16.333 --> 41:19.958
- It's not the caffeine, it's the nerves.
- Please.

41:19.958 --> 41:22.583
You've been ready for this
your whole life, look at you.

41:22.583 --> 41:25.208
This is important for our company.

41:25.208 --> 41:27.791
The world is closing in

41:27.791 --> 41:32.208
and we need something like Goldbug,
something that could be positive.

41:32.208 --> 41:35.333
This is a good start.
I thank you for that.

41:35.333 --> 41:38.208
If it's so important, where is Dad?
Where is Bill?

41:38.208 --> 41:42.625
Men are as stupid as they are simple.
You're better off.

41:43.625 --> 41:47.291
They need to get used to seeing
your beautiful face out there.

41:47.875 --> 41:49.833
Your face in front of the Goldbug logo.

41:49.833 --> 41:52.041
Your face in front of the Fortunato logo.

41:52.041 --> 41:55.250
Not BILLT, the fitness dork.

41:56.208 --> 41:57.500
I miss him.

41:57.500 --> 41:59.708
You won't darling, I promise you that,

41:59.708 --> 42:02.875
because whatever it is you think you miss,
you can get it anywhere.

42:02.875 --> 42:04.000
You're right.

42:05.958 --> 42:07.333
I know. You're right.

42:07.333 --> 42:10.458
Oh, my God, my first husband.

42:11.500 --> 42:12.875
I thought I missed him,

42:12.875 --> 42:15.208
but that was just this temporary insanity.

42:15.208 --> 42:17.958
This burp your heart goes through.

42:18.833 --> 42:21.458
He was fun to ride. Boy.

42:22.916 --> 42:24.500
He wouldn't shut up about kids.

42:24.500 --> 42:27.083
Why do they always want you to have kids?

42:27.083 --> 42:31.166
Men, when they think they're immortal,
all they want to do is fuck.

42:31.166 --> 42:33.291
When they figure out they're going to die,

42:33.291 --> 42:35.083
all they want to do is fuck.

42:36.791 --> 42:39.291
- You ready?
- Of course she is.

42:39.291 --> 42:43.000
I'll give a five minute warning,
introduce you, and you'll cue the video?

42:43.666 --> 42:44.666
Okay.

42:48.416 --> 42:50.250
Break both legs.

43:07.458 --> 43:11.500
[woman] ...pleasure to introduce
the founder of Goldbug, Tamerlane Usher.

43:14.250 --> 43:17.416
[Verna as Tammy] Thank you.
Thank you so much.

43:17.416 --> 43:21.583
I am so grateful
that we're all here together today

43:21.583 --> 43:24.625
to celebrate Goldbug.

43:24.625 --> 43:29.291
As you will see tonight,
Goldbug is the height of opulence.

43:29.291 --> 43:31.541
What the fuck are you doing here?

43:55.750 --> 43:56.958
I mean...

43:58.666 --> 43:59.875
What the fuck...

44:00.916 --> 44:03.541
And excuse my French, I'm just...

44:04.625 --> 44:06.041
I'm that excited.

44:06.041 --> 44:09.916
...are we doing here, right?

44:10.916 --> 44:12.166
Well, let me tell you.

44:12.166 --> 44:14.833
We are here to...

44:16.125 --> 44:17.125
celebrate.

44:18.666 --> 44:23.375
We are here to change lives.

44:23.375 --> 44:29.458
And that is what the fuck
we are doing here.

44:32.958 --> 44:34.625
[applause]

44:39.958 --> 44:41.583
Meet Goldbug.

44:41.583 --> 44:48.541
The first true, high-end beauty, fitness
and health lifestyle brand on the market.

44:48.541 --> 44:52.041
Goldbug isn't just another
subscription service,

44:52.041 --> 44:57.500
or an exercise class,
it's not just Goop, or Peloton.

44:57.500 --> 44:59.875
It is a lifestyle.

44:59.875 --> 45:04.041
And it will actually change your life.

45:04.916 --> 45:07.541
[all applauding]

45:10.333 --> 45:13.458
Opulence in self-actualization.

45:13.458 --> 45:18.291
That is what we are all about,
but more than that.

45:18.291 --> 45:21.125
Let's start with our Goldbug boxes.

45:21.125 --> 45:25.833
Just the first tier in our tower of you.

45:26.333 --> 45:32.708
Each box is built by a panel
of chemists and high-end industry leaders.

45:32.708 --> 45:37.458
A Goldbug subscription is different
from anything else on the market

45:37.458 --> 45:40.750
because of our focus on individuality.

45:40.750 --> 45:45.916
No two boxes are the same
because no two peop...

45:45.916 --> 45:47.000
people...

45:49.291 --> 45:50.625
are the same.

45:57.208 --> 45:58.125
I agree.

45:58.875 --> 46:04.083
We've contracted with luxury companies
from all over the world,

46:04.083 --> 46:06.833
and items found in our Goldbug boxes

46:06.833 --> 46:09.833
are not generally available
to the American public.

46:09.833 --> 46:13.666
In fact, this Goldbug is just for me.

46:14.250 --> 46:19.250
It is tailored to my lifestyle
and, as you'll see...

46:21.583 --> 46:23.166
French energy oil.

46:23.166 --> 46:25.791
Made with black diamond truffle extra...

46:27.708 --> 46:31.916
French energy oil.
Made with black diamond truffle extract.

46:31.916 --> 46:35.375
Some people say
that this is the key to eternal youth.

46:35.375 --> 46:38.125
Well, I've been using it for six weeks,
and I swear...

46:39.208 --> 46:44.458
I don't know how I look,
but I feel ten years younger.

46:45.333 --> 46:46.708
<i>Crème de Lune.</i>

46:46.708 --> 46:50.791
Made with green caviar algae
and South Sea pearls.

46:50.791 --> 46:53.250
This moisturizer is...

46:56.000 --> 46:58.250
The fuck are you doing here?

47:02.208 --> 47:04.666
Just supporting you.

47:09.666 --> 47:11.166
[Tammy laughs]

47:16.583 --> 47:17.541
You know what?

47:18.958 --> 47:20.458
That's enough about me.

47:21.291 --> 47:24.708
Let's talk about you, before we get to our

47:24.708 --> 47:27.541
fitness integration portion
of our presentation.

47:27.541 --> 47:29.583
I'm sure you all remember

47:29.583 --> 47:32.958
submitting your exhaustive profiles
to our Goldbug team.

47:32.958 --> 47:37.041
Well, there is a reason
that we dug so deeply into your business.

47:37.041 --> 47:40.458
If you would just look under
your assigned seats

47:40.458 --> 47:45.000
and find what we have built for you.

47:48.625 --> 47:51.333
Watch. Mine's full of poo.

47:51.333 --> 47:57.625
All the products contained
in our Goldbug boxes are 100% organic.

48:11.250 --> 48:14.333
<i>Okay, tonight is about
positive reinforcement.</i>

48:14.333 --> 48:17.458
<i>I've been stressed out
working too much, so Bill,</i>

48:17.458 --> 48:20.708
<i>I want you to lick her armpits
and then eat her out.</i>

48:20.708 --> 48:22.291
<i>- </i>  [Bill] <i>Yes, dear.
- Oh, Christ.</i>

48:22.291 --> 48:24.583
<i>Just once try and act like
I'm not asking you...</i>

48:24.583 --> 48:26.458
- Turn it off.
- <i>...to do the dishes.</i>

48:27.041 --> 48:29.083
- Turn it off.
<i>- Wait. Armpits for a minute...</i>

48:29.083 --> 48:30.416
Please, turn it off.

48:30.416 --> 48:33.208
<i>I want you to lick her asshole
while she reads a book.</i>

48:33.208 --> 48:34.958
- <i>Or answers emails.</i>
- Turn it off!

48:34.958 --> 48:37.166
- Turn it off!
- <i>And tell her how smart she...</i>

48:37.166 --> 48:38.833
<i>The bum is an up-charge.</i>

48:40.041 --> 48:43.250
- <i>One thing I have is money.</i>
- [Verna] <i>Whatever you want, boss.</i>

48:43.250 --> 48:45.250
<i>You're so fucking smart, after all.</i>

48:45.250 --> 48:47.000
- [yells]
- [crowd exclaiming]

48:48.750 --> 48:50.208
Fuck you!

48:51.625 --> 48:52.625
[grunts]

48:57.666 --> 48:59.125
I'm sorry. I didn't...

49:01.125 --> 49:03.333
Tamerlane Usher is over.

49:04.708 --> 49:07.291
[crowd chattering]

49:17.416 --> 49:18.416
I'm here!

49:20.708 --> 49:22.958
I am right here!

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
[panting]

49:58.791 --> 50:00.000
[cell phone ringing]

50:00.000 --> 50:01.041
[gasps]

50:02.166 --> 50:03.208
[grunts]

50:07.208 --> 50:08.375
[Verna as Tammy] Hello?

50:09.083 --> 50:10.750
Uh, honey.

50:11.791 --> 50:14.208
I... It... It was awful.

50:14.208 --> 50:18.166
I don't know what happened.
I'm so sorry I didn't listen to you.

50:19.291 --> 50:21.250
I am so sorry, Bill.

50:28.916 --> 50:30.458
[normal voice] <i>You can call him back.</i>

50:31.541 --> 50:32.583
You still got time.

50:34.166 --> 50:40.375
<i>Bill, I'm sorry I treated you that way.
Bill, I'm sorry I used you.</i>

50:44.958 --> 50:46.666
<i>Could give him that at least.</i>

50:46.666 --> 50:50.416
<i>Man ate a lot of ass on your behalf.
Maybe you just tell him you're sorry.</i>

50:51.500 --> 50:54.500
You fucking psycho stalker!

50:54.500 --> 50:56.666
That would be so much easier, wouldn't it?

50:56.666 --> 50:57.583
[gasps]

51:05.000 --> 51:06.083
[screams]

51:08.583 --> 51:11.000
<i>You really fucked this one up,
didn't you, Tammy?</i>

51:13.041 --> 51:14.125
Who are you?

51:16.750 --> 51:19.708
<i>I mean, you absorbed your twin
in the womb.</i>

51:20.708 --> 51:26.375
<i>That's fucking hardcore. Hats off.
Wait. Maybe I'm her.</i>

51:26.375 --> 51:30.166
<i>Maybe I've been living all this time
shoved to a dark corner of your skull.</i>

51:30.833 --> 51:32.625
<i>And I've spent 40 years</i>

51:32.625 --> 51:35.291
<i>growing tiny little tendrils
into your brain.</i>

51:36.125 --> 51:37.583
<i>I'm finally taking over.</i>

51:38.750 --> 51:40.875
<i>No. I'm kidding.</i>

51:40.875 --> 51:42.375
<i>I'm actually you.</i>

51:42.916 --> 51:44.750
- What do you want?
- <i>What do you want?</i>

51:46.166 --> 51:49.791
What I want is for you to relax.

51:49.791 --> 51:51.083
[grunts]

51:51.083 --> 51:52.333
I mean it.

51:52.333 --> 51:53.541
[gasps]

51:59.083 --> 52:00.250
[groans]

52:00.791 --> 52:03.583
<i>Keep swinging like that,
you're only hurting yourself.</i>

52:03.583 --> 52:05.083
Fuck you!

52:05.083 --> 52:06.875
<i>Not sure you've got time for that.</i>

52:06.875 --> 52:07.958
[groans]

52:07.958 --> 52:10.416
<i>Besides, I thought you preferred to watch.</i>

52:11.041 --> 52:12.458
If you're so tough...

52:14.083 --> 52:16.291
then why are you so fucking scared of me?

52:16.291 --> 52:17.458
<i>Tammy...</i>

52:21.875 --> 52:25.333
What the fuck do you want from me?

52:25.333 --> 52:26.583
<i>Honey.</i>

52:28.583 --> 52:31.000
<i>No one can take being shot down, scorned,</i>

52:31.000 --> 52:34.833
and attacked 24/7 like you do to yourself.

52:41.625 --> 52:44.250
<i>And if you could hear that, you'd know.</i>

52:44.958 --> 52:48.291
<i>It's your last chance
to be perfectly still.</i>

52:48.291 --> 52:50.958
<i>And breathe before the inevitable.</i>

52:52.291 --> 52:53.291
[yelps]

52:57.416 --> 52:58.458
<i>Sweetie...</i>

53:00.083 --> 53:04.750
<i>you might not believe me,
but this part has nothing to do with you.</i>

53:05.750 --> 53:07.125
I fucked it all up.

53:09.208 --> 53:12.083
I've... I fucked it all up.

53:15.208 --> 53:16.791
I fucked it all up.

53:19.833 --> 53:22.041
I fucked it all up. I just...

53:23.333 --> 53:24.375
I just want...

53:26.458 --> 53:27.500
<i>Some sleep?</i>

53:27.500 --> 53:28.750
[gasps]

54:10.041 --> 54:12.000
[shattering]
