WEBVTT

00:32.814 --> 00:35.383
- [Woman] Get out, you are
leaving tonight, get out.

00:35.426 --> 00:36.688
- [Therron] You gonna put
me out of my own home.

00:36.731 --> 00:37.862
- [Woman] Stop it, Therron, stop
it.

00:37.906 --> 00:38.689
[smacking]

00:38.734 --> 00:39.691
[woman screaming]

00:39.734 --> 00:42.390
[somber melody]

01:19.340 --> 01:21.298
Can I open one, daddy?

01:21.341 --> 01:26.085
- [David] Of course, Liv,
it's your birthday, go for it.

01:26.129 --> 01:28.174
- Hey, who is Ms. Willis?

01:29.740 --> 01:31.960
- Isn't that your teacher, Liv?

01:32.003 --> 01:33.658
- Ms. Tina.

01:33.701 --> 01:37.183
Oh, that's right, her last name
is Willis.

01:38.968 --> 01:40.143
[girl gasping]

01:40.186 --> 01:41.971
She got me the art set I wanted.

01:42.014 --> 01:43.972
This is the one I was talking
about, see?

01:44.015 --> 01:45.147
- Yeah.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.105
Nice, babe.

01:49.718 --> 01:52.329
- Olivia, we can draw a poster
for our dog walking company.

01:52.372 --> 01:53.156
- Can I help?

01:53.200 --> 01:54.504
I'm a really good drawer.

01:54.549 --> 01:55.376
- Okay.

01:56.811 --> 01:58.901
- Where is this balloon
delivery?

01:58.944 --> 02:01.251
Lex, did they call?

02:01.295 --> 02:02.469
- Who?

02:02.513 --> 02:05.560
- Party Palace, they should've
been here.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.216
- Oh, cute.

02:11.217 --> 02:12.044
[girls giggling]

02:12.087 --> 02:13.872
[doorbell ringing]

02:13.915 --> 02:15.222
- [Olivia] They're here, they're
here.

02:15.264 --> 02:16.353
- Happy birthday, Olivia.

02:16.396 --> 02:17.701
- [Olivia] Faith.

02:17.746 --> 02:18.528
Auntie Pat.

02:18.573 --> 02:20.096
- Hey, birthday girl.

02:20.139 --> 02:20.966
- Pat, hi.

02:22.098 --> 02:22.925
- Hey.

02:27.015 --> 02:28.191
- Ah, Patricia.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.584
- Hey, David.

02:29.627 --> 02:30.801
- [David] How's my favorite
teacher?

02:30.846 --> 02:32.413
- Ah, jeez, don't remind me
about work,

02:32.456 --> 02:35.502
this is a celebration
not a therapy session.

02:35.545 --> 02:37.331
- [Will] Get her going about
Cleveland Public Schools,

02:37.373 --> 02:38.984
you won't hear the end of it.

02:39.027 --> 02:40.072
- Good to see you, Will.

02:40.115 --> 02:42.423
- Good to see you, too, bro.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.560
- Children's Bedtime Prayers?

02:49.603 --> 02:50.865
- My mom picked it out.

02:50.908 --> 02:54.435
She got it for me when I
used to have bad dreams.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.959
There's a prayer for different
situations,

02:57.002 --> 03:00.310
when you're afraid, when
you're lonely, when you're sad.

03:00.354 --> 03:03.356
- This is so nice, have
you read all of them?

03:03.400 --> 03:07.969
- Not all of them, some I
read over and over again.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.842
Sometimes my mom reads them to.

03:10.885 --> 03:13.235
- David, you look bad, are you
okay?

03:13.280 --> 03:15.629
Alexis, are you taking care of
your man?

03:15.673 --> 03:19.155
- I know how to take care of my
man, okay?

03:19.199 --> 03:21.069
- Then what's the deal
with these saggy bags?

03:21.112 --> 03:22.201
- Look, I just haven't been
getting

03:22.245 --> 03:23.638
a whole bunch of sleep, that's
all.

03:23.681 --> 03:25.074
- Yeah, it's been weeks.

03:25.116 --> 03:27.771
- Insomnia, that's no good,
can't keep on like that.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.730
- Ah, tell me about it.

03:35.562 --> 03:37.913
- Is it a boy or a girl?

03:37.956 --> 03:39.567
- It's so pretty.

03:39.610 --> 03:40.915
- It looks like a boy.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.656
- What do you think, Hannah?

03:42.699 --> 03:45.180
- Yep, it looks like a boy to
me.

03:45.224 --> 03:46.530
What's his name?

03:47.356 --> 03:49.620
- I'm gonna call him Henry.

03:50.752 --> 03:52.319
- Henry?

03:52.361 --> 03:54.450
- No, not Henry, Gabriel.

03:56.365 --> 03:58.412
- Gabriel's a good name.

04:02.241 --> 04:05.592
- Come on, let's go look at my
dolls.

04:05.635 --> 04:07.420
- Man, I don't believe this.

04:07.463 --> 04:09.336
- [Will] What's up?

04:09.378 --> 04:12.468
- I'm waiting on this delivery,
balloons for the party.

04:12.513 --> 04:13.775
- [Will] You should've used
Party Palace,

04:13.818 --> 04:15.037
my good friend Frank is the
owner.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.298
- It was Party Palace.

04:16.343 --> 04:18.082
[Will chuckling]

04:18.127 --> 04:21.435
- Oh, man, well, call
him up, ask for Frank,

04:21.478 --> 04:25.481
mention my name, he'll take care
of you.

04:25.526 --> 04:26.875
- This is ridiculous.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.355
[girls laughing]

04:28.398 --> 04:31.096
[phone ringing]

04:34.360 --> 04:35.187
- Conner?

04:36.144 --> 04:36.971
Excuse me.

04:39.843 --> 04:40.670
Long time.

04:48.853 --> 04:49.766
Yeah, yeah.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.468
Great to hear from you.

04:55.512 --> 04:56.338
All right.

04:58.949 --> 05:00.778
[doorbell ringing]

05:00.822 --> 05:02.302
- [Will] The balloon delivery is
here.

05:02.345 --> 05:04.086
- Hope they're giving us a
refund.

05:04.129 --> 05:05.348
- [Alexis] Just take the
balloons, David,

05:05.391 --> 05:08.394
it's about Liv today, happy
thoughts.

05:08.437 --> 05:10.266
- What happened to the morning
delivery?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.877
- We had like 20 parties this
morning.

05:12.920 --> 05:16.011
- Well, I had one party and
I ordered express delivery.

05:16.053 --> 05:17.620
- So, do you want the balloons
or not?

05:17.665 --> 05:19.406
- I wanted the balloons six
hours ago.

05:19.449 --> 05:21.363
The party's almost over.

05:21.408 --> 05:24.975
- I'm sorry, sir, I've
had a real tough morning,

05:25.019 --> 05:28.197
please don't make it worse,
I just need a signature.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.459
- What, what the--

05:29.502 --> 05:31.418
- [Alexis] It's okay, David.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.375
We will be calling your manager.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.855
- Fine, call him.

05:35.682 --> 05:37.988
- [Will] Don't worry, bro,
you'll get your money back.

05:38.033 --> 05:40.427
- Yo, yo, what are you looking
at, dude, that's my wife.

05:40.470 --> 05:41.689
Man, it's a little
disrespectful--

05:41.731 --> 05:43.211
- [Will] Hey, hey, hey.

05:43.254 --> 05:44.692
- Yo, get 'em out of here, man.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.867
- Call the number on the
back for customer service.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.564
- Yo, you need some help, I said
get out.

05:48.608 --> 05:51.699
[indistinct yelling]

05:55.790 --> 05:59.314
- You're crazy, man, I'm calling
the cops.

06:02.839 --> 06:04.668
He's gonna ruin this party.

06:04.711 --> 06:08.889
- The party is not ruined,
the kids are still having fun.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.762
Let me help you with that.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.502
- He has been waking up in
the middle of the night,

06:13.547 --> 06:15.286
he gets irritable all the time,

06:15.331 --> 06:16.723
I don't know what's wrong with
him.

06:16.766 --> 06:19.987
- I can tell he is not himself.

06:20.031 --> 06:21.555
- He's definitely gonna ruin
this party.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.600
- Keep it together, Lex.

06:24.644 --> 06:26.211
- Wanna talk about it?

06:26.254 --> 06:27.081
- No.

06:29.084 --> 06:29.911
- Okay.

06:35.699 --> 06:37.613
I'll call Frank myself.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.790
I'll text him now.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.053
- But why did he just have to
go off on somebody today, why?

06:43.098 --> 06:46.014
- [Pat] Listen, we can
deal with this later.

06:46.057 --> 06:47.668
You know what time it is?

06:47.711 --> 06:48.973
- Time for cake?

06:49.016 --> 06:50.365
- Time for cake.

06:51.932 --> 06:54.021
- Time for cake, girls,
all right, come here,

06:54.064 --> 06:56.153
we're gonna cut the cake, come
on.

06:56.197 --> 06:56.980
Come on.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.420
- [Pat] Call the boys in.

07:00.463 --> 07:04.336
- David, Will, get in here,
we're gonna sing Happy Birthday.

07:04.379 --> 07:05.206
- Okay.

07:06.338 --> 07:07.295
- You like it, baby?

07:07.338 --> 07:08.427
- It's beautiful, mommy.

07:08.471 --> 07:09.341
- [Alexis] Good.

07:09.384 --> 07:11.168
- [Pat] All right, let's sing

07:11.213 --> 07:14.521
&k Happy birthday to you

07:16.000 --> 07:19.350
&k Happy birthday to you

07:20.701 --> 07:24.531
&k Happy birthday, dear Olivia

07:26.620 --> 07:29.971
&k Happy birthday to you

07:31.625 --> 07:34.454
[people clapping and cheering]

07:34.497 --> 07:36.846
- [Alexis] All right,
sweetie, make a wish.

07:36.891 --> 07:38.632
- [Pat] Happy wishes.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.812
[indistinct speaking]

07:44.855 --> 07:46.509
- David, Liv, David.

07:47.771 --> 07:48.685
- Call 911.

07:50.033 --> 07:50.817
Call 911.

07:50.860 --> 07:53.863
[suspenseful music]

08:03.483 --> 08:04.483
- It's okay.

08:07.312 --> 08:08.139
It's okay.

08:21.456 --> 08:23.589
- What is taking them so long?

08:23.632 --> 08:26.723
- Well, you know how this goes,
babe.

08:31.901 --> 08:34.034
- It's been almost 30 minutes.

08:34.077 --> 08:34.904
- I know.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.309
- So, based on the CT scan,

08:48.352 --> 08:50.921
it looks as though we have
a serious situation here.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.749
There's a growth in her brain
tissue

08:52.793 --> 08:56.623
and that explains why
she's been blacking out.

08:58.145 --> 09:00.235
- Growth, you mean tumor?

09:01.845 --> 09:04.804
Like another tumor
growing on her brain now?

09:04.847 --> 09:05.674
- Yes.

09:08.111 --> 09:11.855
- Brain cancer is that
treatable, I mean is it curable?

09:11.899 --> 09:13.116
- We're very concerned

09:13.160 --> 09:16.467
and need to do a biopsy
as soon as possible.

09:16.511 --> 09:17.774
- [Alexis] So, what you're
telling us

09:17.817 --> 09:20.211
is that the treatments
didn't work last time?

09:20.254 --> 09:21.735
- No, they were successful.

09:21.778 --> 09:25.913
The cancer we treated
before is in remission.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.261
- But?

09:27.304 --> 09:28.350
- [Doctor] Well, it's come back

09:28.393 --> 09:30.918
in a completely different area.

09:34.965 --> 09:37.533
- So, what do we do now?

09:37.576 --> 09:40.884
She's not eating and
she's been losing weight,

09:40.927 --> 09:42.277
what do we do?

09:42.320 --> 09:43.931
And she's been complaining
about headaches lately.

09:43.974 --> 09:47.499
- And she's been telling
me she's been seeing spots.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.240
- Those are not good signs.

09:49.283 --> 09:50.371
We'll give you a prescription

09:50.414 --> 09:52.808
that should help with the
headaches.

09:52.852 --> 09:55.725
- We have to go through
this all over again, David.

09:55.769 --> 09:59.293
- We feel that we can
successfully treat this.

09:59.336 --> 10:01.339
- So, what do you want us to do?

10:01.383 --> 10:03.298
- Let's schedule the biopsy.

10:03.341 --> 10:04.168
- Wait.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.562
What alternatives do we have?

10:08.695 --> 10:09.783
I don't know if I wanna put her

10:09.826 --> 10:11.958
through that treatment again.

10:12.001 --> 10:13.221
- Let's do the biopsy

10:13.264 --> 10:16.876
and then we'll know
what we're dealing with.

10:18.399 --> 10:20.923
- This is a nightmare.

10:20.967 --> 10:25.494
We can't put her through this,
not again, David, tell her.

10:25.537 --> 10:28.932
- Let's just let the doctors
do what they do, all right.

10:28.975 --> 10:31.934
We'll do whatever it takes
to save our daughter.

10:31.979 --> 10:34.024
- I understand your concerns,
Alexis.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.330
I can refer you to a doctor

10:35.373 --> 10:38.158
who specializes in treating rare
cancers.

10:38.201 --> 10:42.206
It's experimental, but there
have been some amazing results.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.903
No promises, though.

10:44.991 --> 10:47.254
You may feel more comfortable
going in that direction,

10:47.298 --> 10:50.171
but it would not be my first
choice.

10:50.213 --> 10:52.607
I'll have Renee bring the
information.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.740
- Okay, thank you.

10:54.783 --> 10:57.481
- We still wanna schedule the
biopsy.

10:57.525 --> 10:59.701
In the meantime, try to
keep her in a routine

10:59.745 --> 11:01.399
as much as possible.

11:04.793 --> 11:07.535
I'm so sorry you have
to go through all this,

11:07.578 --> 11:09.581
she's such a sweet girl.

11:10.931 --> 11:14.760
[Alexis crying and sniffling]

11:40.830 --> 11:42.527
- I'm scared, David.

11:44.790 --> 11:46.226
- You think I'm not?

11:46.269 --> 11:49.751
- I do not want her to
go through chemo again.

11:49.796 --> 11:50.971
It crushed her the first time.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.363
I mean, do you remember how long
it took

11:52.407 --> 11:54.495
for her to recover from that?

11:54.538 --> 11:56.411
The side effects were horrible.

11:56.453 --> 11:57.803
- Yeah, but it worked.

11:57.846 --> 12:00.197
I mean, we're not just gonna
sit here and do nothing.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.504
- I did not say do nothing.

12:03.504 --> 12:07.552
I wanna look into the
alternative medicine.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.032
- I can't even listen to this
right now.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.426
Look, Liv, needs serious
medical attention.

12:11.469 --> 12:12.818
You're just not thinking
clearly.

12:12.861 --> 12:15.735
- Listen, I am not
trying to argue with you.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.345
I'm just telling you how I feel.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.476
- Look, whatever I have to
do for Liv, I'm gonna do it.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.740
- Oh, you're gonna do it, huh?

12:21.783 --> 12:24.091
You're gonna do it all by
yourself?

12:24.134 --> 12:25.701
You're not the one who's been
with her

12:25.745 --> 12:27.268
when she's been throwing up
in the middle of the night

12:27.311 --> 12:29.052
or when she falls over in the
bathtub.

12:29.096 --> 12:33.013
- Look, do you really have to
make this about you and me?

12:33.056 --> 12:35.450
- It is so hard to talk to you
right now.

12:35.493 --> 12:39.062
- Look, I'm stressed
out just like you are.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.551
[ominous melody]

12:54.643 --> 12:57.298
[somber melody]

13:12.879 --> 13:15.576
[water running]

13:23.715 --> 13:26.370
[cart rattling]

14:00.534 --> 14:03.102
[car rumbling]

14:10.544 --> 14:14.722
How many times I gotta tell
'em to put these toys away?

14:26.778 --> 14:28.083
- Hey, watch it.

14:29.216 --> 14:33.001
- You watch it and stop
going through my trash.

14:33.046 --> 14:36.048
- [mumbling] Trash.

14:37.788 --> 14:40.269
[car honking]

14:54.937 --> 14:57.418
- [David] Stay out of my yard.

15:16.871 --> 15:19.178
&k Everybody's watching

15:19.221 --> 15:21.572
&k And I know they're waiting

15:21.615 --> 15:24.706
&k The pressure's hard for me to
take

15:24.749 --> 15:27.230
&k I work too hard for me to
break

15:27.274 --> 15:30.145
&k Sometimes I get fed up

15:30.190 --> 15:32.539
&k And I wanna give up

15:32.582 --> 15:35.369
&k But I keep on walking in the
light

15:35.412 --> 15:39.241
&k 'Cause I know that
everything will be all right

15:39.286 --> 15:41.418
&k Some days we don't know

15:41.461 --> 15:44.682
&k And those who come to the dark
side

15:44.725 --> 15:46.727
&k But if we keep pressing on

15:46.770 --> 15:50.036
&k We know we gonna see the light

15:50.078 --> 15:51.994
&k Some day we don't know

15:52.038 --> 15:55.258
&k How we gonna make it
through the hard times,

15:55.302 --> 15:57.607
&k But if we keep pressing on

15:57.652 --> 15:59.567
&k Everything will be all right

15:59.610 --> 16:02.091
&k What if I stumble

16:02.134 --> 16:04.701
&k What if I fall

16:04.745 --> 16:08.096
&k Would you come and comfort me

16:08.140 --> 16:10.011
- Are you still not sleeping?

16:10.056 --> 16:11.708
- [David] What can I do for you,
Tyler?

16:11.753 --> 16:13.450
- What's the word on the Reed
situation?

16:13.494 --> 16:15.669
- We're just waiting for a
contract to be faxed over.

16:15.712 --> 16:18.673
- Good, that's a big one, don't
blow it.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.326
- Excuse me.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.677
- David, this is major, we need
this.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.070
- Have I ever blown a deal?

16:24.113 --> 16:25.679
I mean, in all my years here,

16:25.722 --> 16:27.725
have you ever known me to mess
up a deal or lose a client?

16:27.769 --> 16:29.423
- Hey, take it easy.

16:30.640 --> 16:33.774
You know, I always thought my
dad made a mistake hiring you,

16:33.817 --> 16:35.645
but lately, I've been
seeing your performance

16:35.690 --> 16:38.519
and I'm starting to see the
light.

16:39.432 --> 16:40.520
You were a diamond in the rough

16:40.563 --> 16:42.349
and this deal is gonna save our
company,

16:42.392 --> 16:46.221
so I just wanna make sure
that nothing's gonna go wrong.

16:46.265 --> 16:48.094
- I know how to do my job,
Tyler,

16:48.136 --> 16:50.052
that's why your father hired me.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.967
- Just remember to log your
delivery electronically.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.317
- I know how to schedule.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.014
- I didn't say you didn't know
how,

16:56.057 --> 16:58.581
but last month, you entered the
info wrong

16:58.625 --> 16:59.713
and if I wouldn't have found it,

16:59.756 --> 17:01.410
we could have lost a lot of
money.

17:01.455 --> 17:03.065
- You know what, you changed the
info

17:03.109 --> 17:04.458
and didn't give us the new
skews,

17:04.500 --> 17:06.025
that could've cost us the
company.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.592
- Listen, we can do this
all day, but I'm busy,

17:08.635 --> 17:12.290
just make sure to have
your skews this time.

17:29.134 --> 17:29.961
- Hey, Lex.

17:30.005 --> 17:30.832
- Hi, hey.

17:32.268 --> 17:33.095
- [Pat] Good to see you.

17:33.138 --> 17:34.530
- [Alexis] Good to see you.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.794
- I love this place.

17:36.837 --> 17:38.535
What d'you order?

17:38.578 --> 17:40.537
- My usual, white mocha.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.974
- So, how are things?

17:48.501 --> 17:50.765
- Things are falling apart.

17:52.288 --> 17:53.636
I don't know if I can keep
fighting

17:53.681 --> 17:56.465
with David about everything.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.947
I mean, lately, we
can't agree on anything.

17:58.990 --> 18:00.991
- I know this is hard on all of
you,

18:01.036 --> 18:03.778
you have to keep that in
perspective.

18:03.820 --> 18:06.519
David, handles it differently
than you,

18:06.563 --> 18:10.088
but I know it's hurting him just
the same.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.003
- It's like deja vu.

18:14.919 --> 18:16.921
- [Waitress] Cappuccino.

18:20.403 --> 18:23.753
- I can't even imagine
what you're going through,

18:23.798 --> 18:27.105
but I want you to know I'm here
for you.

18:28.280 --> 18:30.544
- She doesn't deserve this.

18:33.199 --> 18:38.116
- My coworker's daughter
went through this last year

18:38.160 --> 18:42.250
and they found this great
program called Angel Wings.

18:43.599 --> 18:47.691
I got you an application,
just take a look at it.

18:52.042 --> 18:55.612
- You know it's hard enough to
deal with Olivia's diagnosis,

18:55.655 --> 18:58.833
let alone navigating around
David's attitude lately.

18:58.875 --> 19:01.488
I mean, I am so sick of it.

19:01.530 --> 19:03.532
I'm fed up, I can't do this,
Pat.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.928
- God is your strength, he's
your shield,

19:06.971 --> 19:09.059
you have to trust in him.

19:10.713 --> 19:13.281
- I mean, I'm getting
no emotional support,

19:13.326 --> 19:14.805
so what am I supposed to do?

19:14.848 --> 19:17.242
- You know what you have to do,
Lex.

19:17.286 --> 19:18.853
- Walk away?

19:18.895 --> 19:19.680
- No.

19:19.722 --> 19:21.724
- Well, then what?

19:21.769 --> 19:23.553
Because I really don't know.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.163
- This is a season.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.991
It's going to pass.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.429
You'll see.

19:29.471 --> 19:32.171
You gotta keep it together, Lex.

19:34.912 --> 19:38.525
- Don't you have someplace else
to be?

19:38.567 --> 19:39.394
- Yeah.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.224
Will you please pray with me
before I go?

19:43.269 --> 19:44.138
- Yeah.

20:06.814 --> 20:09.511
You should try to lay
down and get some sleep.

20:09.556 --> 20:10.904
- I can't sleep.

20:13.298 --> 20:14.996
Did the doctor call today?

20:15.038 --> 20:18.391
- Yeah, I made an
appointment for next Tuesday.

20:18.433 --> 20:20.000
- You gonna take off work?

20:20.044 --> 20:21.394
- Of course.

20:21.436 --> 20:22.873
You gonna come with us?

20:22.916 --> 20:24.744
- Yeah, I'll be there.

20:29.836 --> 20:32.404
- She is getting weaker, David.

20:33.666 --> 20:34.493
- I know.

20:36.104 --> 20:38.846
- I mean, it is coming all back
to me like it was yesterday,

20:38.888 --> 20:42.371
with the hospital visits and the
medicine.

20:43.459 --> 20:44.677
I hate the thought of Olivia

20:44.721 --> 20:46.983
having to go through this all
over again.

20:47.028 --> 20:50.727
- I know, she's been
through so much already.

20:54.513 --> 20:58.169
- You know, I called about
the alternative medicine.

20:58.212 --> 21:02.869
It sounds incredible, David,
I mean, the doctor was right,

21:02.913 --> 21:05.480
they have had some amazing
results

21:05.525 --> 21:07.656
and I know it's really
expensive, but I think that we--

21:07.701 --> 21:10.269
- I just don't know about this,
okay,

21:10.311 --> 21:12.749
I think we need to just let
the doctors do what they do.

21:12.792 --> 21:15.490
- Just look it over at least.

21:15.535 --> 21:18.058
It could save Liv from
so many side effects.

21:18.102 --> 21:19.930
- You've been talking about
all these natural remedies

21:19.973 --> 21:22.105
and herbal medicines and
everything, okay,

21:22.150 --> 21:25.893
now is just not the time
to experiment, okay?

21:26.807 --> 21:28.939
We need to let the doctors do
their job.

21:28.982 --> 21:31.898
[glass shattering]

21:34.467 --> 21:35.294
Oh, man.

21:37.034 --> 21:37.861
Ow, shoot.

21:47.740 --> 21:48.828
- Let me see.

21:54.835 --> 21:59.578
What are you gonna do about
you not sleeping, David?

21:59.622 --> 22:01.755
Did Will call you yet?

22:01.798 --> 22:03.321
- Yeah, he called.

22:05.236 --> 22:06.715
- And?

22:06.759 --> 22:09.327
- Well, he told me about
some group or something,

22:09.371 --> 22:12.505
he called it a life group or
something.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.549
I'm just not interested.

22:15.637 --> 22:18.728
- Yeah, I mentioned that to you
earlier.

22:18.771 --> 22:21.557
Pat invited me to hers
and I thought it was nice.

22:21.601 --> 22:23.166
- Babe, I'm just not
interested in sitting around

22:23.211 --> 22:25.169
with a whole bunch of dudes I
don't know.

22:25.212 --> 22:26.866
- You know Will.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.259
- Well, I'll call Will up

22:28.303 --> 22:32.046
and invite him to watch
the game on Saturday.

22:33.700 --> 22:37.137
- I just think it would
help you talk to Will.

22:37.181 --> 22:38.922
Okay, I'm worried about you.

22:38.965 --> 22:40.228
- I'll be fine.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.894
- All right, then I'm
worried about us then.

22:54.938 --> 22:58.811
I mean, you have to see
what this is doing to us.

22:58.855 --> 23:01.902
- Baby, it's just not the time.

23:01.944 --> 23:04.644
- Well, when is a good time?

23:04.686 --> 23:06.123
I mean, you're not sleeping,

23:06.166 --> 23:08.560
you're irritable all the
time and it's getting worse.

23:08.604 --> 23:11.301
You start drinking again and
we're not even connecting.

23:11.346 --> 23:12.913
- You know, what do you want me
to do?

23:12.955 --> 23:14.000
What do you want me to do?

23:14.044 --> 23:15.654
I mean, I'm doing everything I
can.

23:15.698 --> 23:17.526
I'm even going to your church.

23:17.569 --> 23:21.442
- I want you to talk to
someone about your anger.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.357
- Now, you want me to see a
psychiatrist,

23:23.402 --> 23:24.750
here we go with that.

23:24.794 --> 23:27.057
- You hold your feelings in all
the time

23:27.101 --> 23:30.320
and you let it build and
build and you just explode.

23:30.365 --> 23:31.278
- That happened once.

23:31.321 --> 23:34.151
- No, it happens all the time.

23:34.194 --> 23:36.414
David, whatever it is
you are going through,

23:36.458 --> 23:37.851
I'm here for you.

23:50.384 --> 23:53.387
- You want me to go to a life
group?

23:57.871 --> 23:58.653
Fine.

23:59.915 --> 24:02.179
I'll give Will a call back.

24:03.397 --> 24:07.707
- I just want you to
give it a chance, for me.

24:07.750 --> 24:08.576
- For you.

24:10.884 --> 24:11.753
- For us.

24:15.540 --> 24:16.411
- For us.

24:36.038 --> 24:38.564
- All right, now watch me do
this.

24:38.606 --> 24:39.781
Corner pocket.

24:40.957 --> 24:43.176
- [Man] Oh!
- [Man] Oh, man.

24:43.220 --> 24:45.048
- Yeah, I could do this all
night.

24:45.092 --> 24:46.093
- Yeah, man.

24:47.007 --> 24:50.923
&k Girl, you're so cool

24:50.967 --> 24:53.578
&k So cool, yeah

24:55.144 --> 24:58.887
&k Girl, you're so cool.

24:58.932 --> 25:00.280
- David Medford.

25:01.455 --> 25:03.196
Hoping you'd show up.

25:07.941 --> 25:09.508
Hey, you shoot pool?

25:09.550 --> 25:10.377
- Little something.

25:10.421 --> 25:11.553
- [Brian] What's up, fellas?

25:11.596 --> 25:12.641
- Hey, Brian.

25:13.859 --> 25:14.686
- [Brian] How you doing?

25:14.730 --> 25:15.904
- Man, I'm good, man, David.

25:15.949 --> 25:17.340
- [David] Hey, Brian.

25:17.384 --> 25:18.298
- Man, come here, man.

25:18.342 --> 25:19.734
[laughing]

25:19.778 --> 25:21.563
- You don't give regular
handshakes around here, man?

25:21.606 --> 25:22.868
- No, that's how we do it.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.086
- [Will] Nah, man, it's good for
you,

25:24.131 --> 25:25.219
man, good for your soul.

25:25.261 --> 25:26.654
- Oh, yeah, okay.

25:28.352 --> 25:29.919
- Hey, you memorize it yet?

25:29.962 --> 25:30.963
- The verse?

25:32.487 --> 25:34.183
Not yet man, you?

25:34.228 --> 25:37.797
- Be quick to listen, slow to
speak, and slow to get angry,

25:37.839 --> 25:40.582
your anger can never make
things right in God's sight.

25:40.625 --> 25:41.800
- Look at you, man.

25:41.844 --> 25:44.325
Man, that's all right, bro, good
job, man.

25:44.367 --> 25:46.326
- Yeah, man, took me a week.

25:46.369 --> 25:47.675
- Imma have it next time we get
together.

25:47.720 --> 25:48.851
- All right.
- Lemme get on this table.

25:48.894 --> 25:50.200
- All right.

25:50.243 --> 25:51.070
- Oh, man.

25:52.201 --> 25:55.117
Come on, Will, your shot, man.

25:55.162 --> 25:58.077
- David, Fred Marks, what's up,
man?

25:58.121 --> 25:59.339
Aw, no hug?

25:59.383 --> 26:00.297
- No hug, bro.

26:00.340 --> 26:01.471
- All right, welcome, David.

26:01.516 --> 26:02.909
- All right, man.

26:04.171 --> 26:07.957
&k 'Cause she's got a vibe
about her that's so fine

26:08.000 --> 26:09.611
&k And there is no doubt

26:09.654 --> 26:12.005
&k That we are two of a kind

26:12.048 --> 26:13.746
- Want a drink?

26:13.788 --> 26:14.615
- Sure.

26:14.660 --> 26:17.792
[indistinct chatting]

26:20.099 --> 26:22.798
- Hey, what can I get you guys
tonight?

26:22.842 --> 26:24.451
- Can I get a coke?

26:25.626 --> 26:27.759
- Something dark and neat.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.326
Doesn't even matter what.

26:30.371 --> 26:32.199
- Okay, be right back.

26:34.635 --> 26:36.463
- Great bunch of guys.

26:37.943 --> 26:40.772
- Y'all always meet like this?

26:40.816 --> 26:43.863
- Sometimes we bowl, sometimes
we hit the driving range,

26:43.905 --> 26:45.038
we mix it up.

26:46.692 --> 26:49.607
- I was imagining something way
different.

26:49.651 --> 26:50.608
- Like what?

26:54.221 --> 26:56.570
- Couple grumpy old dudes
sitting at a table, man,

26:56.615 --> 27:00.401
with a big ol' bible with
[chuckling].

27:00.443 --> 27:02.184
- That was funny.

27:02.229 --> 27:03.883
I can't blame you, shoo,

27:03.925 --> 27:07.146
been to a couple of those groups
before.

27:07.190 --> 27:08.974
No, we're pretty relaxed here,

27:09.018 --> 27:13.108
just a bunch of knuckleheads
doing life together.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.896
What happened to your hand?

27:17.940 --> 27:21.029
- Oh, man, just a little cut.

27:21.074 --> 27:22.423
- Stitches?

27:22.465 --> 27:25.556
- Yeah, a few, man, it ain't
nothing.

27:29.647 --> 27:30.560
- Hey, man.

27:32.214 --> 27:35.958
I know it's tough for you and
Alexis with Olivia being sick.

27:36.001 --> 27:40.180
But I want you to know that
I'm praying for you all.

27:41.834 --> 27:45.619
- We're still trying to process
it, man.

27:45.663 --> 27:48.057
It's just crazy, you know?

27:48.101 --> 27:49.624
- Right.

27:49.667 --> 27:53.453
- I mean, my daughter going
through something like this,

27:55.760 --> 27:58.807
I would do anything to
take her place, you know?

27:58.851 --> 28:00.113
- 'Course I do.

28:01.548 --> 28:05.378
Bro, I'm so sorry that
she going through this.

28:06.989 --> 28:10.078
Let me know if there's
anything we could do to help.

28:10.123 --> 28:11.471
- [David] Thanks.

28:11.515 --> 28:14.605
- No, I'm serious, anything
we could do to help.

28:14.648 --> 28:15.954
- Oh, man, yeah.

28:17.869 --> 28:19.740
Hey, how long y'all
been meeting like this?

28:19.785 --> 28:22.526
How often do you meet with the
guys?

28:22.569 --> 28:25.094
- This is our third year.

28:25.137 --> 28:28.009
My main goal with the group
is to let guys be guys.

28:28.054 --> 28:29.795
You know, no judgment.

28:29.837 --> 28:33.842
We study the bible, we do
our best to live by it.

28:33.885 --> 28:35.844
- I went to church a lot when I
was a kid,

28:35.887 --> 28:38.541
we didn't have nothing like
this, though.

28:38.586 --> 28:41.675
- The biggest benefit of
the group is accountability.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.502
- Is that right?

28:42.546 --> 28:43.373
- Yeah.

28:44.679 --> 28:46.724
We keep each other on track.

28:46.768 --> 28:47.682
Gut checks.

28:48.901 --> 28:50.380
- Everybody's down with that?

28:50.423 --> 28:54.471
- Yeah, that is your choice
to grow or stay the same.

29:03.219 --> 29:05.568
- [Alexis] Hey, Liv, breakfast
is ready.

29:05.613 --> 29:07.746
- Did you feed Gabriel last
night?

29:07.788 --> 29:10.226
- [Alexis] Yes, I did, come and
eat.

29:10.269 --> 29:13.708
- He looks starved, how
much did you give him?

29:13.751 --> 29:17.885
- [Alexis] Just come in
here and eat your breakfast.

29:18.931 --> 29:20.410
- What are we having?

29:20.453 --> 29:21.280
- Oatmeal.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.326
- Yuck.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.027
- Come on, baby, you gotta eat
your food.

29:28.069 --> 29:29.810
- I hate oatmeal.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.856
- What, since when, you love
oatmeal,

29:31.900 --> 29:33.075
what are you talking about?

29:33.118 --> 29:35.861
- It doesn't taste like
anything.

29:36.775 --> 29:40.604
- Hm, well, let's add
some strawberries to it.

29:41.997 --> 29:44.173
- [David] Good morning, my
beauties.

29:44.217 --> 29:45.044
Hey.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.829
- Hey, daddy, I'm feeling better
today.

29:48.874 --> 29:52.747
- Oh, Liv, that's good,
I'm glad to hear that.

29:53.835 --> 29:55.228
Hey, babe.
- Hey.

29:56.229 --> 29:57.751
Hey, daddy, will you tell Liv

29:57.796 --> 29:59.405
that she needs to eat her
oatmeal?

29:59.449 --> 30:00.885
She'll listen to you.

30:00.929 --> 30:02.931
- Liv, eat your oatmeal.

30:03.888 --> 30:06.152
- I don't like oatmeal.

30:06.194 --> 30:07.935
- [David] Well, what do you
want?

30:07.980 --> 30:08.849
- Pancakes.

30:09.807 --> 30:12.461
- Well, let's get some pancakes.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.901
- Pancakes it is, all right.

30:15.943 --> 30:16.815
- Yes.

30:20.513 --> 30:21.776
- Hey, babe.
- Yeah?

30:21.819 --> 30:23.256
- We gotta pick up Liv's
new prescription today,

30:23.298 --> 30:25.824
should help with her appetite.

30:27.390 --> 30:28.565
- That's good.

30:29.914 --> 30:32.265
- Babe, she's gotta start
eating.

30:32.307 --> 30:33.569
- I know.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.528
But she always ate like a little
bird,

30:35.572 --> 30:37.400
my little Tweety Bird.

30:38.401 --> 30:42.230
- Yeah, well, now she's eating
even less.

30:42.275 --> 30:45.494
- Let's get her what she
wants, whatever she asks for.

30:45.538 --> 30:49.325
I just wanna see my baby
doing cartwheels again.

30:49.368 --> 30:51.458
- Do you wanna see the
picture I drew for mommy?

30:51.500 --> 30:53.502
- Yeah, of course, I do.

30:57.028 --> 30:57.855
- You okay?

30:57.898 --> 30:59.074
I can get it for you.

30:59.117 --> 31:02.337
- [Liv] No, thanks, it's fine, I
got it.

31:02.382 --> 31:03.164
- Okay.

31:13.393 --> 31:14.915
- Oh, that's very nice, Liv,

31:14.960 --> 31:17.657
look at that, that is really
good.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.921
I see your mom there and...

31:22.228 --> 31:24.230
- That's me and Gabriel.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.406
- Okay.

31:27.450 --> 31:30.713
Well, yeah, no, I see that, I
see that.

31:31.714 --> 31:33.847
- I'm still working on yours.

31:33.892 --> 31:34.935
- Okay, cool.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.373
- What happened to your hand?

31:39.722 --> 31:42.551
- Got into a fight with a
toaster.

31:43.509 --> 31:44.336
- Hey!

31:45.685 --> 31:47.339
- [David] Well, I gotta go, love
ya.

31:47.383 --> 31:48.210
- Hey!

32:03.964 --> 32:06.532
- All right, Mr. Reed.

32:06.576 --> 32:09.144
Come on, let's make this money.

32:25.334 --> 32:27.902
- [Woman] Reed Construction,
may I help you?

32:27.945 --> 32:29.382
- Mr. Reed, please.

32:29.424 --> 32:30.861
- [Woman] May I ask who's
calling?

32:30.904 --> 32:33.559
- This is David Medford, Easy
Electronics.

32:33.603 --> 32:34.996
- [Woman] One moment, please.

32:35.039 --> 32:35.865
- Sure.

32:44.179 --> 32:45.920
- [Reed] David, my man.

32:45.963 --> 32:48.704
- Mr. Reed, thanks for taking my
call.

32:48.749 --> 32:50.316
- [Reed] Look, I'm headed out of
town.

32:50.358 --> 32:52.839
I'm actually taking the wife
up to Kelly's Island this week,

32:52.883 --> 32:55.756
but I figured I outta get back
to you before I hit the road.

32:55.798 --> 32:57.584
- Well, great, I'll get right to
it.

32:57.626 --> 32:58.627
Well, it looks like we have

32:58.672 --> 33:00.020
all the items you inquired
about,

33:00.065 --> 33:04.286
the Color Pro 3370, three
of the Print Pro 5000s,

33:04.329 --> 33:07.549
and five of the Print Pro 2500s.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.813
- [Reed] Those 2500s are
the smaller ones, right?

33:09.856 --> 33:14.296
- That's right, they print
up to 25 ISO in black,

33:14.339 --> 33:18.909
built in wireless and ethernet,
600 by 600dpi resolution.

33:18.952 --> 33:21.041
It's top of the line.

33:21.086 --> 33:25.263
- [Reed] Let's go with four
of the Print Pro 5000s.

33:27.395 --> 33:29.920
- Four, great, we can do that.

33:30.921 --> 33:32.227
- [Reed] That sounds great,

33:32.270 --> 33:33.750
so everything is available
now, though, right?

33:33.794 --> 33:36.665
- Of course, I can have it
delivered as soon as next week,

33:36.710 --> 33:39.320
all we need is a purchase
order or a check by phone.

33:39.365 --> 33:40.713
- [Reed] Excellent, excellent.

33:40.757 --> 33:42.237
David, you are a great salesman,

33:42.280 --> 33:44.195
I need a leader like you on my
team.

33:44.239 --> 33:45.761
What would it take?

33:45.806 --> 33:49.330
- Oh, I've been with the
company for quite a while now,

33:49.375 --> 33:50.810
they treat me pretty well.

33:50.854 --> 33:52.203
- [Reed] Treating you pretty
well.

33:52.247 --> 33:54.380
You gotta have thoughts of
expanding your horizons,

33:54.423 --> 33:58.949
I mean, your company's a
small fish in a big pond,

33:58.992 --> 34:01.821
but look, anyway, don't
let me poison your mind,

34:01.865 --> 34:04.477
just fax or email over the final
quote.

34:04.519 --> 34:07.480
- I'll do it this afternoon
and have a great trip.

34:07.522 --> 34:08.784
- [Reed] Thanks, we'll talk
soon.

34:08.829 --> 34:10.873
- All right, talk to you.

34:13.050 --> 34:13.833
Yes.

34:13.876 --> 34:15.096
[David laughing]

34:15.139 --> 34:16.358
Thank you, God.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.014
- Did you close?

34:20.056 --> 34:22.103
- Resending the quotes right
now,

34:22.146 --> 34:23.887
he just ordered another 5000.

34:23.931 --> 34:27.543
- Another Print Pro 5000,
that's a huge commission,

34:27.585 --> 34:29.458
don't blow it.

34:29.501 --> 34:31.503
- What can I do to help?

34:35.463 --> 34:36.813
- I'll rewrite the agreement

34:36.856 --> 34:40.686
and I'll send it over
with the quote, I'm good.

34:42.731 --> 34:45.126
- Let me know when you close.

35:05.494 --> 35:06.581
- Knock, knock.

35:06.626 --> 35:07.409
- [David] Conner.

35:07.452 --> 35:08.889
- What's up, man?

35:09.802 --> 35:10.672
How you been, dude?

35:10.717 --> 35:12.893
- [David] Aw, man, good, good.

35:12.936 --> 35:15.851
- Man, this is a nice
office you got here, man.

35:15.896 --> 35:17.418
- What are you doing down here,
man?

35:17.463 --> 35:18.724
- Doing some business in the
area,

35:18.768 --> 35:22.728
I thought I would stop
by and see what's up.

35:22.771 --> 35:24.121
- You still in the same
business?

35:24.164 --> 35:25.340
- You know me?

35:25.384 --> 35:27.690
I got a little bar
opening up in Cleveland,

35:27.733 --> 35:31.563
I have something-something
going on Columbus with partners.

35:31.606 --> 35:33.521
- You still with Chantelle?

35:33.565 --> 35:36.438
- Chantelle, haven't seen
her in five years, man.

35:36.481 --> 35:39.920
She took the kid and moved to
Phoenix.

35:39.963 --> 35:41.356
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,
man.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.052
- [Conner] I see you're still
married.

35:43.097 --> 35:44.880
- Yes, yeah, man, 10 years.

35:44.925 --> 35:49.103
- 10 years, wow, dude, Mr.
Family Man, Mr. Executive,

35:50.713 --> 35:53.976
salesman of the year, David D.
Medford.

35:54.891 --> 35:57.371
You know, your grandma would be
proud.

35:57.416 --> 36:01.550
- Yeah, man, well, she
raised us the best she could.

36:01.594 --> 36:04.510
- Remember that time you stole
that car

36:04.552 --> 36:06.860
and we hid it in her garage?

36:06.902 --> 36:10.210
- Do I, man, that was the
worst decision of my life, man.

36:10.255 --> 36:13.170
- She kept asking me whose car
was it,

36:13.213 --> 36:14.650
I was like, "That's my uncle's."

36:14.693 --> 36:16.217
- You kept giving her those fake
names.

36:16.260 --> 36:19.481
[Conner laughing]

36:19.525 --> 36:22.048
- If she actually called the
cops on us,

36:22.092 --> 36:24.398
you know we would've been in
juvie

36:24.443 --> 36:26.748
for the rest of our juvie lives.

36:26.793 --> 36:28.273
- Absolutely, man, I got whooped

36:28.315 --> 36:30.492
the worst that day of my life.

36:30.536 --> 36:33.407
- That was probably the
worst beating I ever had.

36:33.452 --> 36:36.454
- Man, that was a long time ago.

36:36.498 --> 36:37.585
- Good times.

36:43.809 --> 36:45.289
You happy with this?

36:45.333 --> 36:49.771
- Yeah, man, you know,
it's legit and I'm stable.

36:49.815 --> 36:52.384
- But are you really happy

36:52.427 --> 36:56.170
with the money you're making
right now?

36:56.213 --> 36:58.693
- Yeah, man, we're doing well.

37:00.652 --> 37:04.264
- That's cool, I see you, family
man.

37:04.309 --> 37:06.311
I see you're going to church,
too.

37:06.353 --> 37:08.574
- What are you, following me?

37:08.617 --> 37:12.751
- Dude, Alexis got all of
your business on Facebook,

37:12.795 --> 37:16.581
talking about anniversaries,
weddings, birthdays.

37:16.625 --> 37:20.280
Oh, speaking of birthdays,
I saw Olivia got really big.

37:20.324 --> 37:24.458
She's huge now, she's like
a big girl, how is she?

37:26.505 --> 37:29.768
- They diagnosed her with brain
cancer.

37:33.032 --> 37:36.297
- I am so sorry, man, that's
awful.

37:36.340 --> 37:37.166
[phone ringing]

37:37.210 --> 37:39.344
- Yeah, it's tough.

37:39.387 --> 37:40.822
Hold on a second.

37:43.608 --> 37:44.391
- Hey, Lex.

37:44.436 --> 37:45.827
- Hey, you got a minute?

37:45.871 --> 37:47.003
- Yeah, what's wrong?

37:47.047 --> 37:49.092
- So, Pat mentioned a nonprofit

37:49.135 --> 37:52.574
that offers grants for medical
treatments for children.

37:52.617 --> 37:54.315
- What's the name of the
company?

37:54.358 --> 37:56.273
- Well, the company's called
Angel Wings

37:56.317 --> 37:58.057
and we would still have to apply
for it,

37:58.101 --> 37:59.451
but it would cover the
cost of the treatment

37:59.494 --> 38:01.496
that I want for Liv.

38:01.539 --> 38:02.628
- I thought we were going

38:02.670 --> 38:04.934
with the doctor's plan on this,
babe.

38:04.978 --> 38:07.458
- You never heard me say that.

38:09.068 --> 38:11.070
- Okay, let's talk about
it when I get home.

38:11.114 --> 38:12.811
- All right, love you.

38:12.855 --> 38:14.856
- All right, I love you.

38:28.610 --> 38:32.047
- Look, man, if it's a money
problem,

38:32.092 --> 38:33.572
I can help you out, man.

38:33.614 --> 38:36.356
- Oh, man, no, we're good.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.621
Just some things we gotta work
through.

38:41.362 --> 38:42.755
- Dude, if you need anything,

38:42.797 --> 38:45.409
like medical bills or anything,
I got you.

38:45.452 --> 38:47.367
It's not a problem.

38:47.411 --> 38:51.590
- No, I just signed the biggest
contract of my career, dude,

38:52.460 --> 38:54.418
so I think we're gonna actually
be okay,

38:54.461 --> 38:56.159
we're gonna be good.

38:58.945 --> 39:01.947
- I mean, dude, you don't look
good.

39:04.036 --> 39:07.039
I can help you guys out,
it's literally no problem.

39:07.083 --> 39:08.389
It's just money.

39:09.956 --> 39:14.438
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right,
all right, but we're good.

39:14.481 --> 39:17.789
- All right, anyway, man, it
was nice seeing you, all right.

39:17.833 --> 39:19.052
- Yeah, man, great seeing you,
bro.

39:19.094 --> 39:20.269
- All right.
- All right.

39:20.313 --> 39:21.097
- All right.

39:21.141 --> 39:22.141
- All right.

39:36.025 --> 39:37.940
- [Tyler] What's the
word on that deal, David?

39:37.983 --> 39:40.681
- We're good, but what's going
on?

39:40.726 --> 39:43.032
- Oh, we're tightening up ship,

39:43.076 --> 39:45.251
we're scaling back on a lot of
things.

39:45.295 --> 39:47.994
In fact, I need all of my
salespeople

39:48.036 --> 39:50.126
to run reports this morning.

39:50.170 --> 39:52.650
- This morning, I can have
it to you by this afternoon,

39:52.693 --> 39:54.827
I'm a little swamped this
morning.

39:54.869 --> 39:56.436
- Well, I suggest you
do what you have to do

39:56.481 --> 39:58.873
to get it to me this morning.

40:00.135 --> 40:01.963
- You trying to fire me, Tyler?

40:02.007 --> 40:05.010
- Can you just do what I asked?

40:05.054 --> 40:06.141
- Well, how's the scaling back

40:06.186 --> 40:07.447
gonna affect the product line?

40:07.492 --> 40:08.666
I mean, I can't have my
customers

40:08.710 --> 40:10.364
ordering things we don't carry.

40:10.407 --> 40:13.018
- I won't beat around the
bush, the company's in trouble.

40:13.061 --> 40:15.369
Our numbers have been really
low for the past seven months

40:15.413 --> 40:19.155
and this is gonna come
as no surprise to you,

40:20.460 --> 40:21.679
we're downsizing.

40:21.722 --> 40:23.159
- Downsizing?

40:23.202 --> 40:25.597
- Relax, you get to keep your
job,

40:25.639 --> 40:27.902
but the rating staff
is gonna have to agree

40:27.947 --> 40:29.862
to a 20% decrease in pay.

40:29.905 --> 40:32.646
- 20%, how do you expect
me to live off that?

40:32.690 --> 40:34.735
- It's just until we
get through the slump.

40:34.780 --> 40:37.956
We should be back on track
within six months to a year.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.697
At least you get to keep your
job.

40:39.740 --> 40:42.047
- Well, what about this
deal I got on the table?

40:42.090 --> 40:43.789
- Yeah, when are you
gonna close that, David?

40:43.831 --> 40:45.443
- Tyler, I need this commission.

40:45.485 --> 40:48.793
I can't afford to lose
20%, I don't believe this.

40:48.836 --> 40:50.882
- Listen, David, times are
tight,

40:50.925 --> 40:54.668
everybody has to cut back and
step up.

40:54.713 --> 40:55.626
[snapping]

40:55.670 --> 40:58.717
Are you following me, David?

40:58.760 --> 40:59.586
- Yeah.

41:00.980 --> 41:03.983
Yeah, we gotta cut back and step
up.

41:05.679 --> 41:08.422
- Now, if you wanna walk out
that door,

41:08.465 --> 41:10.945
if that feels better
for you, then go ahead,

41:10.989 --> 41:12.469
otherwise fall in.

41:33.186 --> 41:36.188
[telephone ringing]

41:38.539 --> 41:41.019
David Medford, Easy Electronics.

41:41.063 --> 41:43.891
- [Reed] David, it's Darren
Reed from Reed Construction.

41:43.936 --> 41:45.414
- Mr. Reed.

41:45.458 --> 41:46.807
- [Reed] Hey, look, is this a
good time?

41:46.851 --> 41:48.505
- Yes, it is, did you get the
quote?

41:48.548 --> 41:50.072
What can I do for you?

41:50.115 --> 41:54.380
- [Reed] Yeah, look, we're
gonna go in another direction.

41:54.423 --> 41:56.382
- You want me to revise
the original proposal?

41:56.425 --> 42:00.126
- [Reed] Nah, I mean like
go with another company.

42:00.168 --> 42:03.346
- Mr. Reed, is there
something I can help you--

42:03.389 --> 42:05.260
- [Reed] David, you were a good
salesman,

42:05.304 --> 42:08.655
look, you're a great salesman,
good luck to you, okay?

42:08.699 --> 42:09.614
- Mr. Reed.

42:22.800 --> 42:25.543
[David groaning]

42:34.159 --> 42:37.423
[indistinct crosstalk]

42:53.222 --> 42:54.833
- All right.

42:54.876 --> 42:56.311
The memory verse.

42:57.400 --> 43:01.056
James 1:19 through 20,
anybody wanna say it?

43:02.666 --> 43:06.409
- Be quick to listen, slow to
speak, and slow to get angry,

43:06.452 --> 43:09.324
your anger can never make
things right in God's sight.

43:09.369 --> 43:10.195
- Great.

43:11.675 --> 43:15.070
The key to next level
breakthrough is memory verse

43:15.114 --> 43:16.594
and the application.

43:16.637 --> 43:18.639
- Well, Imma have mine next
week.

43:18.682 --> 43:19.858
- You're good.

43:21.336 --> 43:23.425
Anybody else wanna say
anything before we finish up?

43:23.469 --> 43:26.168
- Yeah, Will, you remember
how I was telling you guys

43:26.211 --> 43:30.128
about my foreman at work who
was feeling really depressed?

43:30.172 --> 43:33.697
Just the other day, I asked
him if I could pray for him

43:33.740 --> 43:36.309
and he asked why I was going to
church

43:36.351 --> 43:39.007
and I said, "It ain't about
church."

43:39.050 --> 43:41.793
I said, "It's about accepting
God's love,

43:41.835 --> 43:45.012
"turning from your sin,
and following Jesus."

43:45.056 --> 43:46.972
So, we went back and forth a
bit,

43:47.014 --> 43:49.757
but I think I made an
impression.

43:50.715 --> 43:51.715
- [Man] Amen, bro.

43:51.759 --> 43:53.630
- [Man] Thanks.

43:53.673 --> 43:54.719
Thanks, amen.

43:56.764 --> 43:58.199
- I got a confession.

43:58.244 --> 44:01.943
I lost my temper the other
day with my wife again.

44:01.987 --> 44:03.378
I called her a B, man.

44:03.422 --> 44:04.250
- Oh!

44:08.514 --> 44:11.735
- She said I was a sorry excuse
for a man

44:11.778 --> 44:13.476
and that I was weak.

44:18.132 --> 44:18.960
I lost it.

44:20.179 --> 44:23.311
- Well, did you go back and make
it right?

44:23.356 --> 44:24.748
- I've been on the couch in the
basement

44:24.791 --> 44:26.664
for the last two days.

44:30.101 --> 44:32.277
- Sorry to hear that, bro.

44:33.235 --> 44:35.454
- And she was wrong, I
mean, the stuff she said

44:35.498 --> 44:37.675
was real disrespectful.

44:37.717 --> 44:40.112
Why I always gotta be
the one to apologize?

44:40.155 --> 44:41.242
- Yeah, yeah.

44:43.985 --> 44:45.030
- It's rough.

44:47.554 --> 44:49.556
Let me talk to you some.

44:55.954 --> 44:57.215
Ephesians 5:25.

44:58.782 --> 45:02.916
Husbands love your wife just
as Christ love the church

45:02.960 --> 45:06.704
and gave himself up for
her to make her holy.

45:08.182 --> 45:10.925
- I know the verse, Will.

45:10.969 --> 45:12.666
It's just hard, man.

45:17.452 --> 45:19.760
I gotta think about my kids.

45:20.673 --> 45:23.851
If I'm being truly honest,
that's the reason I'm in it.

45:23.894 --> 45:25.766
I don't know what I'd
do if I lost my kids.

45:25.809 --> 45:28.463
[somber melody]

45:47.440 --> 45:49.876
- All right, guys, let's go over

45:49.920 --> 45:53.097
this memory verse over in
Galatians 1.

46:24.824 --> 46:26.695
- [Will] Everything's okay, bro?

46:26.739 --> 46:29.742
- Yeah, man, I just needed a
minute.

46:33.659 --> 46:37.054
- I bought that at a auction in
New York.

46:38.751 --> 46:41.320
I wasn't really into fine arts.

46:42.581 --> 46:45.889
Pat love angels, angel this,
angel that.

46:48.980 --> 46:51.809
- [David] How was angels?

46:51.851 --> 46:56.291
- Pat thinks that there are
angels watching over us.

46:56.335 --> 47:00.686
I heard it so much that
whenever I see a picture

47:00.730 --> 47:02.731
or figurine or anything,

47:05.213 --> 47:06.648
I get it for her.

47:13.655 --> 47:14.744
Does it help?

47:17.050 --> 47:18.878
- Yeah, man, it helps.

47:20.358 --> 47:21.186
- David.

47:23.449 --> 47:26.539
I know you've been going through
a lot,

47:26.581 --> 47:30.672
but I want you to know that
I've been praying for you.

47:30.717 --> 47:35.286
Pat and I been lifting you
and the family up every night.

47:35.329 --> 47:38.072
- I feel like I'm losing it,
man.

47:40.596 --> 47:42.293
- Hang in there, bro.

47:43.903 --> 47:46.951
Your family needs you especially
now.

47:48.690 --> 47:50.518
Have you been praying?

47:51.780 --> 47:55.829
- Man, praying is the hardest
thing I could do right now.

47:55.873 --> 47:58.005
It's too hard for me, man.

47:59.963 --> 48:02.661
- It's always the hardest thing,

48:03.967 --> 48:06.708
but it's the best option we
have.

48:08.842 --> 48:09.711
- [David] Do you really believe

48:09.755 --> 48:12.367
angels are watching us, Will?

48:12.411 --> 48:13.498
- Yeah, I do.

48:16.067 --> 48:17.764
Let me pray for you.

48:32.039 --> 48:32.952
Father God.

48:33.954 --> 48:35.521
Merciful and kind.

48:36.695 --> 48:40.829
I stand here as a man who life
you changed with great power,

48:42.005 --> 48:45.443
I ask that you do the same for
David.

48:45.487 --> 48:47.141
Show yourself to him.

48:47.184 --> 48:52.016
Do a miracle in his life,
lord, heal his daughter.

48:52.059 --> 48:54.322
Heal Olivia, you can do it.

48:58.021 --> 49:01.068
I pray that you will give
David and me the power

49:01.112 --> 49:05.072
through your spirit to control
our anger

49:05.115 --> 49:09.293
and lead our families with
authority and humility.

49:11.949 --> 49:15.603
We ask all these things
in Jesus name, amen.

49:22.568 --> 49:24.657
- I really felt that, Will.

49:24.699 --> 49:25.701
- Yeah, man.

49:28.922 --> 49:30.402
- Let me ask you something.

49:30.445 --> 49:31.271
- Sure.

49:33.534 --> 49:36.320
- Do you ever feel like
God's not listening?

49:36.364 --> 49:39.018
- He's always listening.

49:39.063 --> 49:40.324
Be strong, bro.

49:44.938 --> 49:48.333
Will you stay and watch the game
with us?

49:49.507 --> 49:51.422
- Yeah, I'll stay, man.

50:28.286 --> 50:29.460
Conner?

50:29.503 --> 50:30.853
- David, my man.

50:32.507 --> 50:34.248
- Hey, man, I saw you called.

50:34.291 --> 50:37.164
- Yeah, man, you good,
what's up, how's Olivia?

50:37.208 --> 50:39.340
- She's a fighter, man, she's
tough.

50:39.384 --> 50:41.429
- Man, I know where she got that
from.

50:41.472 --> 50:44.998
Well, look, if I can do
anything, just let me know,
okay?

50:45.041 --> 50:48.045
- Well, Alexis was thinking

50:48.088 --> 50:50.090
we should try an alternative
medicine

50:50.134 --> 50:51.657
and I was against it at first,

50:51.699 --> 50:55.617
but it looks like my
insurance may be changing.

50:57.010 --> 51:00.318
- Look, if you need cash, I got
you, man.

51:00.360 --> 51:02.929
- I'm not really sure
what I'm asking, man.

51:02.972 --> 51:06.454
- Check it, I love Olivia like
she's my own flesh and blood.

51:06.498 --> 51:08.413
Just tell me what you need.

51:08.456 --> 51:10.849
Listen, man, you gotta leave
that J-O-B

51:10.893 --> 51:14.027
and get with me, man, and
make some real dollars,

51:14.070 --> 51:16.594
you don't have to worry about
money.

51:16.637 --> 51:19.684
I'm serious, David, you
still got rep on the street,

51:19.728 --> 51:21.730
I can set you back up, man.

51:21.773 --> 51:24.690
- No, bro, I'm not interested.

51:24.733 --> 51:26.952
- Not interested, I saw your
office,

51:26.996 --> 51:29.608
I know what you're driving.

51:29.650 --> 51:32.088
- Look, that's just not
me anymore, all right.

51:32.132 --> 51:35.788
- Oh, yeah, think about
it, for your family.

51:37.005 --> 51:38.878
Hey, I gotta run.

51:38.920 --> 51:40.139
- Yeah.

51:40.184 --> 51:41.445
- [Conner] 100.

52:25.619 --> 52:26.403
- Hey.

52:26.447 --> 52:27.273
- Hey.

52:36.239 --> 52:37.065
How was it?

52:37.110 --> 52:38.764
- It was good.

52:38.806 --> 52:39.981
We had a good time.

52:40.025 --> 52:40.940
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

52:40.983 --> 52:42.985
- I'm glad to hear that.

52:45.291 --> 52:48.077
Pat and Monica came over
earlier.

52:50.340 --> 52:54.213
I forgot to pick up Liv's
prescription, can you?

52:54.257 --> 52:55.302
- Yeah, yeah.

52:56.824 --> 52:58.175
- You all right?

53:09.447 --> 53:11.623
- Baby, they cut my hours.

53:13.407 --> 53:15.409
- What, what's going on?

53:16.541 --> 53:18.456
- The numbers are down.

53:19.456 --> 53:22.110
They let a lot of people go

53:22.155 --> 53:25.637
and the rest of us have to take
a pay cut.

53:26.855 --> 53:29.902
I mean, the company's in
trouble.

53:29.945 --> 53:33.601
I don't even know how
long I'll be employed.

53:36.648 --> 53:39.302
- This is the worst timing ever.

53:40.347 --> 53:41.956
- Tell me about it.

53:43.697 --> 53:47.266
- You know, Pat organized a
collection

53:47.311 --> 53:48.833
from the other ladies in our
group

53:48.876 --> 53:51.271
and they gave us almost $300.

53:53.621 --> 53:57.103
- Collection, baby, what you
tell 'em?

53:57.146 --> 53:58.364
I mean, you know how I feel
about

53:58.409 --> 54:00.759
having our business out
there on the street?

54:00.802 --> 54:03.978
- Patricia was just looking out
for us.

54:04.023 --> 54:06.373
- What, does Patricia think I
can't take care of my family?

54:06.416 --> 54:08.201
I mean, is that what you think?

54:08.244 --> 54:10.985
- David, listen to yourself.

54:11.030 --> 54:12.117
You can't be serious right now.

54:12.161 --> 54:13.641
- No, I'm serious.

54:21.648 --> 54:25.304
- I printed out an application
for Angel Wings today,

54:25.349 --> 54:26.827
let's fill it out.

54:28.873 --> 54:31.485
Listen, baby, this is our wake
up call,

54:31.528 --> 54:33.704
we should be praying.

54:33.748 --> 54:37.577
- This is all happening
at the same time, God.

54:38.623 --> 54:41.755
- Did you hear what I said,
David?

54:41.800 --> 54:44.672
Maybe God's trying to get your
attention.

54:44.715 --> 54:46.630
- Baby, I've been praying.

54:46.673 --> 54:50.068
I don't know what else you want
me to do.

54:51.331 --> 54:52.853
If God really cares about us,

54:52.898 --> 54:55.378
I mean, if he cares about Liv,

54:56.380 --> 54:58.382
we just need some money.

55:01.340 --> 55:04.083
- Money doesn't solve
everything.

55:05.998 --> 55:06.911
It doesn't.

55:09.262 --> 55:12.873
- Maybe it don't, but
it'll solve something.

55:16.487 --> 55:17.922
Baby, I'm trying.

55:19.358 --> 55:21.099
I'm sorry, all right.

55:28.802 --> 55:31.065
[Liv groaning]

55:31.110 --> 55:32.590
- Mommy, I'm cold.

55:36.114 --> 55:38.856
- Okay, baby, let me tuck you
in.

55:45.951 --> 55:47.474
Now, how's that, baby?

55:47.518 --> 55:48.518
- It's fine.

55:49.737 --> 55:50.521
Daddy.

55:50.563 --> 55:51.913
- Yeah?

55:51.956 --> 55:55.003
- Would you ever put me in a
nursing home?

55:55.047 --> 55:57.092
- Liv, you're too young
for a nursing home,

55:57.135 --> 55:59.050
why would you even ask me that?

55:59.094 --> 56:02.663
- Faith said that when her
grandmother got cancer,

56:02.706 --> 56:05.884
they had to put her in a nursing
home.

56:07.451 --> 56:10.628
- Oh, no, Liv, you don't
have to worry about that.

56:10.670 --> 56:13.456
- I'm not worried, do you wanna
know why?

56:13.500 --> 56:14.371
- Tell me.

56:14.414 --> 56:16.373
- Auntie Pat wrote in my book.

56:16.416 --> 56:17.851
- [David] What book?

56:17.896 --> 56:20.027
- My book of children's prayers.

56:20.072 --> 56:22.074
She gave it to me on my
birthday.

56:22.117 --> 56:23.161
- What did she write?

56:23.204 --> 56:25.425
- Look in the inside cover.

56:28.123 --> 56:28.949
- Okay.

56:31.561 --> 56:32.389
It says.

56:33.693 --> 56:37.393
If you say, "The Lord is my
refuge,"

56:37.436 --> 56:40.222
and make the most high your
dwelling,

56:40.266 --> 56:42.789
no harm will ever take you

56:42.833 --> 56:46.532
and no disaster will come near
your tent

56:46.577 --> 56:49.188
for he will command his
angels concerning you

56:49.231 --> 56:51.711
to guard you in all your ways.

56:52.670 --> 56:54.322
Psalm 91, 9, and 10.

56:55.934 --> 56:57.369
Love, Auntie Pat.

56:58.762 --> 57:00.329
- I love the prayers in here.

57:00.373 --> 57:01.983
- Yeah, you do?

57:02.027 --> 57:06.204
- Yeah, they're really short
like this one right here.

57:10.514 --> 57:12.472
A prayer for wisdom.

57:12.516 --> 57:14.474
Can I read this one?

57:14.518 --> 57:17.956
- Oh, Liv, we gotta get to bed,
but okay.

57:21.612 --> 57:23.264
- A prayer for wisdom.

57:23.309 --> 57:25.266
Grant us wisdom in time of doubt

57:25.311 --> 57:27.617
to do the things we know we
ought.

57:27.661 --> 57:29.619
Shine the light upon your way

57:29.663 --> 57:32.099
and help us walk from day to
day.

57:32.143 --> 57:34.101
Renew our minds, so that we're
clear

57:34.146 --> 57:37.541
to know if it's truly your voice
we hear.

57:37.583 --> 57:38.628
- That's good.

57:38.672 --> 57:41.501
- I told you they were short.

57:41.545 --> 57:44.286
I'll read this one next.

57:44.329 --> 57:45.331
- Liv, okay.

57:48.115 --> 57:51.902
- Angels all around, when
darkness falls on dreary night

57:51.945 --> 57:54.295
and the wind beats against my
window,

57:54.340 --> 57:57.864
I rest assured that even then
there are angels all around.

57:57.909 --> 57:59.867
When the fear of loneliness
lingers

57:59.911 --> 58:01.826
and my heart begins to ache,

58:01.869 --> 58:03.653
I can rest assured that even
then

58:03.697 --> 58:05.655
there are angels all around.

58:05.699 --> 58:08.266
It's love, your love that
comforts me

58:08.309 --> 58:10.137
and nothing else compares.

58:10.181 --> 58:11.443
You are my shelter

58:11.487 --> 58:15.927
and I know you've placed
the angels all around.

58:15.969 --> 58:20.061
See, it's just like the one
Auntie Pat wrote in my book.

58:20.105 --> 58:22.976
I love this one, I believe it.

58:23.021 --> 58:25.197
- You believe there are
angels watching over us?

58:25.239 --> 58:26.067
- Yes.

58:28.155 --> 58:29.809
- Well, I think you're right,
sweetie.

58:29.853 --> 58:33.248
Now, let's let the angels watch
you sleep.

58:33.291 --> 58:35.512
- Wait, I didn't read my
favorite.

58:35.554 --> 58:38.297
- Liv, it's way past your
bedtime.

58:38.340 --> 58:39.907
- One last prayer, daddy.

58:39.951 --> 58:41.692
- Liv, you gotta get some rest.

58:41.735 --> 58:44.521
- Please, daddy, one last
prayer.

58:46.610 --> 58:48.568
- All right, one last prayer.

58:48.612 --> 58:51.048
- Yes, can you read this one?

58:54.617 --> 58:57.708
- All right, a prayer for God's
will.

58:58.969 --> 59:03.148
The grand design was set in
place before the world began.

59:04.844 --> 59:08.849
Careful thought was given to
every part,

59:08.893 --> 59:10.981
it was a perfect play.

59:11.025 --> 59:13.505
Though, pain and tears perfect
my faith

59:13.550 --> 59:15.463
and brokenness to heal,

59:16.900 --> 59:19.990
yet confident in you, my lord,

59:20.034 --> 59:22.775
that you'll do your perfect
will.

59:24.342 --> 59:26.300
- [Liv] That one's my favorite,

59:26.344 --> 59:28.869
that and the one about the
angels.

59:28.913 --> 59:32.438
- Yeah, that last one was nice,
I like it.

59:34.135 --> 59:37.050
- Daddy, does it hurt when you
die?

59:40.925 --> 59:42.534
- Not always, baby.

59:44.275 --> 59:47.757
- How old do you think I'll be
when I die?

59:49.672 --> 59:51.630
- How does 150 sound?

59:51.675 --> 59:53.023
- Daddy!

59:53.067 --> 59:54.938
[Liv coughing]

59:54.981 --> 59:57.418
- Whoa, baby, you okay, baby?

01:00:00.335 --> 01:00:03.599
That's it, you gotta get some
rest now.

01:00:08.516 --> 01:00:10.518
You gotta get some rest.

01:00:13.478 --> 01:00:14.914
I love you.

01:00:14.958 --> 01:00:16.655
- Love you, too, daddy.

01:00:16.699 --> 01:00:17.961
Night.

01:00:18.005 --> 01:00:19.440
- Goodnight, Liv.

01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:35.021
I gotta make something happen.

01:00:36.719 --> 01:00:37.721
- We gotta finish filling out

01:00:37.764 --> 01:00:39.853
this application for Angel's
Wings.

01:00:39.896 --> 01:00:42.681
You gotta sign in two places.

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:45.684
- I got a favor I could call in.

01:00:45.728 --> 01:00:47.208
- Favor, from who?

01:00:50.123 --> 01:00:53.257
Fine, I'll fill it out and
you just gotta sign, okay?

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.782
- Yeah, I said I'll handle it.

01:01:01.353 --> 01:01:02.833
- And don't forget to
pick up Liv's prescription

01:01:02.876 --> 01:01:04.311
while you're out.

01:01:08.402 --> 01:01:10.188
- Well, tell her to call my
lawyer

01:01:10.231 --> 01:01:13.452
because I'm not giving her a
penny more.

01:01:13.494 --> 01:01:14.931
I don't care.

01:01:14.974 --> 01:01:18.804
After everything I've given
her, she wants to do this.

01:01:18.849 --> 01:01:22.679
Yeah, you tell her to get the
best lawyer she can afford,

01:01:22.722 --> 01:01:25.028
it won't be on my dime.

01:01:25.072 --> 01:01:26.246
Yeah, goodbye.

01:01:32.036 --> 01:01:34.385
She's a real beauty, ain't she?

01:01:34.429 --> 01:01:36.996
60th birthday present to myself.

01:01:37.041 --> 01:01:38.650
- Yeah, she's nice.

01:01:39.608 --> 01:01:42.262
- Get in, check out the leather.

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:45.657
- That's okay.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:50.358
- I'm not going to kidnap
you, I promise, get in.

01:01:50.402 --> 01:01:52.490
You were checking it out.

01:01:59.106 --> 01:01:59.932
Get in.

01:02:09.943 --> 01:02:13.467
306 horsepower, zero to 60 in
5.8 seconds.

01:02:15.643 --> 01:02:18.342
19 inch wheels on this beauty.

01:02:18.385 --> 01:02:19.996
She's my pride and joy.

01:02:20.039 --> 01:02:22.782
- Yeah, she's real nice, what
year?

01:02:22.826 --> 01:02:27.003
- Brand new, just got her,
birthday present to myself.

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:32.400
- Well, happy birthday,
man, happy belated birthday.

01:02:32.443 --> 01:02:34.010
You give great gifts.

01:02:34.054 --> 01:02:35.273
- [Peter] Peter.

01:02:35.315 --> 01:02:36.927
- What was that?

01:02:36.969 --> 01:02:40.757
- My name's Peter Popovich and
thanks for the birthday wish.

01:02:42.976 --> 01:02:44.411
- Don't mention it.

01:02:44.456 --> 01:02:46.980
- Do you think I'm wrong?

01:02:47.023 --> 01:02:49.983
I'm just trying to protect what
I built.

01:02:50.027 --> 01:02:51.463
- I'm sorry, what?

01:02:51.505 --> 01:02:54.378
- You know, what I was
saying on the phone,

01:02:54.422 --> 01:02:55.989
you heard me, right?

01:02:56.032 --> 01:02:59.427
You know, my wife and soon to be
ex,

01:02:59.471 --> 01:03:02.168
she always knows how to push my
buttons.

01:03:02.213 --> 01:03:04.302
I just lose it, you know?

01:03:05.172 --> 01:03:07.652
I mean, you can't disrespect a
man

01:03:07.695 --> 01:03:11.135
and then expect him to
just roll over and take it?

01:03:11.177 --> 01:03:13.572
If you wanna divorce me, fine,

01:03:13.614 --> 01:03:17.489
but don't think you'll get
another dime out of my money.

01:03:17.532 --> 01:03:19.838
- It's a tough position to be
in.

01:03:19.882 --> 01:03:23.711
- Finally, somebody
finally got it, thank you.

01:03:25.713 --> 01:03:28.673
I never should've married her.

01:03:28.717 --> 01:03:30.153
My sister told me, she's too
young,

01:03:30.197 --> 01:03:32.677
she just wants your money,

01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:34.898
but that didn't matter to me.

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:39.728
She's gorgeous and I was always
a sucker for a pretty face.

01:03:39.771 --> 01:03:41.905
Should've listen.

01:03:41.947 --> 01:03:44.907
Yeah, she's a real
piece of work, that one.

01:03:44.951 --> 01:03:49.869
Everybody could tell she was
always trying to change me.

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:50.914
- Into what?

01:03:51.958 --> 01:03:54.134
Change you, into what?

01:03:54.177 --> 01:03:57.615
- Whatever she wanted, that's
what.

01:03:57.659 --> 01:04:01.576
Eat this, eat that, wear
this, don't wear that.

01:04:03.969 --> 01:04:07.146
She even tried to pick
out my friends for me.

01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:09.802
You know, I'm a grown man.

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:11.108
- David.

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:14.762
- I'm a grown man,
David, I'm twice her age,

01:04:14.806 --> 01:04:16.940
you don't try to change a grown
man.

01:04:16.983 --> 01:04:18.244
[Peter breathing heavily]

01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:21.030
- Hey, you're not having
a heart attack, are you?

01:04:21.074 --> 01:04:24.773
- David, how do you keep from
losing it?

01:04:24.817 --> 01:04:28.646
What do you do, punch a
brick wall or something?

01:04:28.690 --> 01:04:31.780
Is that why you're wearing a
bandage?

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:36.393
- Funny you should ask.

01:04:36.436 --> 01:04:38.699
I've been going to this
support group recently.

01:04:38.744 --> 01:04:40.527
- Like AA or something.

01:04:40.572 --> 01:04:42.487
- Me and my wife, we started
going to

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:45.315
this church and these groups.

01:04:45.358 --> 01:04:46.186
- Like AA?

01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:50.538
- Kind of.

01:04:51.844 --> 01:04:53.541
It's been helping me sort some
things out

01:04:53.585 --> 01:04:56.195
and see some things in a
different light.

01:04:56.239 --> 01:04:57.893
- So, you found God?

01:05:00.286 --> 01:05:03.507
- Actually, it's more like he
found me.

01:05:07.251 --> 01:05:11.255
I'm still learning
everything, but I'm thankful.

01:05:15.215 --> 01:05:17.043
- Good for you, David.

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:23.920
- Hey, listen, it's been
great talking to ya.

01:05:23.963 --> 01:05:25.704
- [Peter] Hey, David.

01:05:26.835 --> 01:05:28.576
Thanks for listening.

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:35.757
- Hey.

01:05:37.628 --> 01:05:39.891
Would you mind if I...

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.938
Like can I pray for you?

01:05:46.028 --> 01:05:47.681
- I'm not religious,

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:52.469
but I wouldn't take
offense to the gesture.

01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:55.603
Sure, what the hell?

01:05:57.692 --> 01:06:00.869
[indistinct mumbling]

01:06:04.525 --> 01:06:05.612
- Father God.

01:06:07.092 --> 01:06:10.182
I know you're in the
business of changing lives,

01:06:10.226 --> 01:06:11.663
you changed mine.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:16.014
I was angry and you gave me
patience.

01:06:17.016 --> 01:06:20.541
I was prideful and you showed me
my sin

01:06:20.585 --> 01:06:22.891
and my need for Jesus

01:06:22.934 --> 01:06:25.981
and I know you can do the
same for my friend here

01:06:26.025 --> 01:06:29.811
and I pray that you would in
Jesus name.

01:06:29.855 --> 01:06:30.681
Amen.

01:06:33.554 --> 01:06:34.380
- Thanks.

01:06:35.556 --> 01:06:36.731
Thanks, David.

01:06:38.603 --> 01:06:42.780
There should be more nice
guys like you in the world.

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:54.793
[doors slamming]

01:06:59.797 --> 01:07:02.626
[wrench clicking]

01:07:03.757 --> 01:07:05.978
- All right, let us know if
you guys need anything else

01:07:06.021 --> 01:07:08.153
and we'll pick up the
pizza on our way back.

01:07:08.197 --> 01:07:10.068
- Okay, you have some cash on
you?

01:07:10.112 --> 01:07:12.027
- [Pat] Yeah, I'm good.

01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:21.079
- I have a good woman, bro.

01:07:21.123 --> 01:07:22.690
You do, too.

01:07:22.733 --> 01:07:25.606
- Yeah, she puts up with me.

01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:27.956
- Still not getting much sleep?

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.045
- Not really.

01:07:30.916 --> 01:07:32.873
- Have you seen a doctor about
it?

01:07:32.918 --> 01:07:34.746
- You know, they want me to
do some sleep study, man,

01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:37.139
but I just haven't had
time to schedule it.

01:07:37.182 --> 01:07:39.184
- Well, you need to look into
it, man,

01:07:39.228 --> 01:07:41.186
you're not looking good.

01:07:41.231 --> 01:07:42.231
- I've been feeling better,
though,

01:07:42.275 --> 01:07:45.496
since I went to that group
meeting.

01:07:45.539 --> 01:07:48.976
I guess hearing the other
guys talk about their lives,

01:07:49.021 --> 01:07:51.414
it made me feel like I wasn't
the only with problems,

01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:52.719
it really helped.

01:07:52.764 --> 01:07:55.940
- Yeah, that's why we do
it, it helps all of us.

01:07:55.983 --> 01:07:58.900
- Hey, how'd you become the
leader?

01:08:01.902 --> 01:08:04.992
- I don't know if Pat told you.

01:08:05.036 --> 01:08:07.952
I did eight years on a 25 year
bid.

01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:11.739
Five years into my sentence,

01:08:11.782 --> 01:08:15.568
a chaplain came to the prison,
just kept talking to me.

01:08:15.612 --> 01:08:18.529
He would ask me questions about
my life,

01:08:18.572 --> 01:08:20.399
just listen, you know?

01:08:22.096 --> 01:08:23.140
After a while, he started
telling me

01:08:23.185 --> 01:08:27.103
about this plan that God had for
my life.

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:29.496
I wouldn't try to hear any of
it.

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:32.149
Every time he would leave, he
would ask me

01:08:32.194 --> 01:08:34.587
do I want him to pray for me.

01:08:36.068 --> 01:08:38.895
After about 50 times, I said
yeah.

01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:44.685
And that moment changed my life.

01:08:44.729 --> 01:08:47.033
- What were you in for, man?

01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:50.082
- Attempted murder.

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:53.259
Armed robbery.

01:08:54.738 --> 01:08:57.087
I was a lost cause.

01:08:57.131 --> 01:09:00.353
After eight, the court had mercy
on me,

01:09:01.572 --> 01:09:03.313
got a favor honestly.

01:09:08.533 --> 01:09:11.667
- Yeah, I was probably
about seven or eight,

01:09:11.712 --> 01:09:14.149
probably about to turn eight.

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:19.198
It was cold in the house.

01:09:20.417 --> 01:09:24.595
I always remember how cold
the wood floor always was.

01:09:26.551 --> 01:09:27.380
My mother.

01:09:28.988 --> 01:09:30.514
She had just come home from work

01:09:30.555 --> 01:09:32.819
and as usual she was tired.

01:09:35.082 --> 01:09:37.912
She had just gotten paid.

01:09:37.956 --> 01:09:39.349
She was gonna use the money

01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:42.917
to buy me and my sister some
school shoes.

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:46.443
Man, she was so tired.

01:09:46.484 --> 01:09:49.095
She came home and fell asleep
on the living room couch

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:51.229
still in her work clothes.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:56.408
And my father came home drunk.

01:09:56.453 --> 01:09:57.975
Nothing new.

01:09:58.019 --> 01:09:59.194
He would get so wasted

01:09:59.238 --> 01:10:01.587
and then cuss everybody out in
the house

01:10:01.631 --> 01:10:03.372
and he would beat us.

01:10:04.809 --> 01:10:07.203
He didn't even need a reason.

01:10:08.159 --> 01:10:10.510
This particular day,

01:10:10.554 --> 01:10:11.815
he came home drunk

01:10:11.859 --> 01:10:14.688
and started going through
my mother's purse.

01:10:14.731 --> 01:10:16.472
He knew it was payday

01:10:18.082 --> 01:10:23.001
and he just wanted to use her
money to go buy his drink.

01:10:23.043 --> 01:10:26.046
My mother woke up and let him
have it.

01:10:26.091 --> 01:10:29.399
She started yelling and cussing,

01:10:29.442 --> 01:10:31.878
I'd never seen her like that.

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:37.755
Me and my sister were
doing homework in our room.

01:10:39.278 --> 01:10:41.411
I heard my mother yelling.

01:10:42.412 --> 01:10:45.719
I couldn't make out what she was
saying.

01:10:48.069 --> 01:10:52.247
I don't know why, but I
went and hid in her closet.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:59.037
That's when I heard her
footsteps coming closer.

01:10:59.079 --> 01:11:01.082
My mother came in first.

01:11:02.127 --> 01:11:05.783
She was mad at him, throwing
his stuff in the trash bag.

01:11:05.826 --> 01:11:07.479
- [Mom] I want you gone tonight.

01:11:07.524 --> 01:11:09.525
- My father came in behind her,

01:11:09.569 --> 01:11:12.442
yelling and screaming, "This is
my house."

01:11:12.484 --> 01:11:13.659
He grabbed her.

01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:15.444
- [Mom] What are you doing with
my purse?

01:11:15.488 --> 01:11:17.577
Stop it, Therron, stop it.

01:11:17.621 --> 01:11:20.971
- My mother was yelling for him
to stop.

01:11:22.842 --> 01:11:25.280
All I could see was her feet.

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.762
It was like they were dancing.

01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:35.377
My mother yelled to me and my
sister.

01:11:35.421 --> 01:11:38.771
- [Mom] Stop it, David, call the
police.

01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:42.341
- Oh, man, all of the sudden,

01:11:42.385 --> 01:11:46.389
it was like an earthquake
in our house, man.

01:11:46.431 --> 01:11:48.956
I saw my mother hit the floor.

01:11:52.612 --> 01:11:56.789
A black pistol fell out in
front of the closet door.

01:11:58.270 --> 01:12:02.404
My mother's eyes were open
and her lips were moving,

01:12:05.233 --> 01:12:08.975
I just couldn't make
out what she was saying.

01:12:12.893 --> 01:12:15.721
I heard my dad yelling back at
her.

01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:17.550
I just reached for the gun,

01:12:17.594 --> 01:12:19.987
it was closer than I thought.

01:12:21.032 --> 01:12:25.036
- Don't you ever touch
my mother or Sadie again.

01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:33.697
- I don't know where or even if
I hit him,

01:12:33.739 --> 01:12:36.264
but all I know is he fell back

01:12:38.658 --> 01:12:41.269
and he ran right out the house.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.881
We never saw him again.

01:12:43.923 --> 01:12:47.579
To this day, I don't know if
that man is dead or alive.

01:12:51.627 --> 01:12:52.454
- Wow.

01:12:53.586 --> 01:12:54.587
That's heavy.

01:12:54.631 --> 01:12:57.372
- My mother never heard from
him.

01:13:02.855 --> 01:13:07.033
She never said nothing, man,
but I know she blamed me.

01:13:10.646 --> 01:13:12.518
I don't know why, as crazy as he
was,

01:13:12.561 --> 01:13:14.476
she couldn't leave him.

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:19.872
- She still living?

01:13:19.917 --> 01:13:22.136
- No, man, no, no, that's why we
went

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:24.399
to live with my grandmother

01:13:24.443 --> 01:13:26.792
and I actually had street
cred after that, man.

01:13:26.837 --> 01:13:28.229
All the kids was saying,

01:13:28.273 --> 01:13:32.712
"Here's the kid crazy
enough to kill his own dad."

01:13:32.756 --> 01:13:36.846
Who would ever thought we
had that kinda history?

01:13:40.894 --> 01:13:42.983
- God can change anybody.

01:13:44.202 --> 01:13:45.029
- Yeah.

01:13:49.033 --> 01:13:51.164
Well, moving forward.

01:13:51.208 --> 01:13:53.385
Go ahead and start her up.

01:14:00.565 --> 01:14:03.176
[car rumbling]

01:14:05.876 --> 01:14:07.399
You're good to go.

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:10.967
- Good job, my friend.

01:14:12.752 --> 01:14:15.451
Where'd you learn how to fix
cars?

01:14:15.493 --> 01:14:16.930
- We've been taking cars apart

01:14:16.974 --> 01:14:19.019
and putting 'em back together
since we was kids, man,

01:14:19.063 --> 01:14:21.326
I know everything there
is to know about cars.

01:14:21.368 --> 01:14:23.414
- Well, everything for a reason.

01:14:23.458 --> 01:14:25.243
- Well, I don't know if
there's much reason to it,

01:14:25.286 --> 01:14:26.679
we just bad kids.

01:14:28.899 --> 01:14:30.029
- How much do I owe you?

01:14:30.073 --> 01:14:32.729
- Oh, man, it's all good.

01:14:32.771 --> 01:14:34.644
- You've been out here
for an hour and a half.

01:14:34.686 --> 01:14:36.210
- No, man, really, don't worry
about it.

01:14:36.253 --> 01:14:39.779
I mean, you've been helping
me sort through my head.

01:14:39.823 --> 01:14:42.520
- Well, iron sharpen iron.

01:14:42.564 --> 01:14:44.217
- What's that?

01:14:44.261 --> 01:14:46.481
- Well, basically, we
look out for each other,

01:14:46.524 --> 01:14:49.266
make each other stronger.

01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:51.529
- Iron sharpens iron, okay.

01:15:20.603 --> 01:15:22.038
- Talk to me.

01:15:22.082 --> 01:15:24.911
- Conner, hey, man, you got a
sec?

01:15:25.824 --> 01:15:28.175
- Always, what's up?

01:15:28.219 --> 01:15:31.351
- [David] I may need to
take you up on that offer.

01:15:31.395 --> 01:15:33.703
- My man, how much you need?

01:15:34.833 --> 01:15:35.835
- Like five.

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.011
- [Conner] 5,000.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:43.494
- Look, it would just be a
loan, all right, I'll owe you.

01:15:43.538 --> 01:15:46.671
- Dude, don't worry about
it, I got 10 for you, okay?

01:15:46.716 --> 01:15:49.021
It's no big deal, we're good,
bro.

01:15:49.065 --> 01:15:50.588
How soon do you need it?

01:15:50.632 --> 01:15:54.766
- Well, I was thinking
sometime soon like this week.

01:15:56.073 --> 01:15:57.421
- I got you.

01:15:57.465 --> 01:16:01.600
You know what, meet me at
my girl's place tonight?

01:16:01.644 --> 01:16:02.993
- Tonight, okay.

01:16:05.386 --> 01:16:08.301
Now, look, it's just a loan.

01:16:08.345 --> 01:16:09.608
I'll give it right back to you,

01:16:09.652 --> 01:16:12.568
I'm just in transition with my
job.

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:17.398
- Dude, don't worry about
it, get this address down.

01:16:17.442 --> 01:16:19.530
- Hey, man, thanks, dude.

01:16:22.969 --> 01:16:24.970
You're a lifesaver, man.

01:16:26.015 --> 01:16:28.627
- You know, a lot of people say
that.

01:16:28.671 --> 01:16:30.237
See you soon, dude.

01:16:40.856 --> 01:16:42.118
- [Alexis] Hey, baby.

01:16:42.162 --> 01:16:46.689
- Hey, hey, I'm gonna be
a little late tonight.

01:16:46.731 --> 01:16:48.429
- [Alexis] Okay, I
scheduled an appointment

01:16:48.472 --> 01:16:50.693
for a nurse to see Olivia at
home,

01:16:50.735 --> 01:16:53.652
I'd like for you to be here to
meet her.

01:16:53.695 --> 01:16:54.913
- What time?

01:16:54.957 --> 01:16:56.306
- [Alexis] 7:30.

01:16:57.829 --> 01:17:02.181
- I don't know, I don't
know if I can, I'll try,

01:17:02.225 --> 01:17:03.530
how's Olivia?

01:17:03.574 --> 01:17:05.097
- [Alexis] She ate a
little bit this afternoon.

01:17:05.141 --> 01:17:07.012
Just sleeping now.

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:08.623
- Okay, you give her the
medicine?

01:17:08.667 --> 01:17:09.972
- [Alexis] Yeah.

01:17:11.016 --> 01:17:13.932
It was really hard for
her to get comfortable.

01:17:13.976 --> 01:17:16.327
She's probably sleeping now.

01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:20.810
- Listen, babe, things are
gonna turn around, okay

01:17:20.853 --> 01:17:23.681
- [Alexis] Yeah, I hope so.

01:17:23.725 --> 01:17:25.684
- All right, I love you.

01:17:39.002 --> 01:17:39.828
God.

01:17:42.005 --> 01:17:44.006
I'm desperate right now.

01:17:46.095 --> 01:17:47.837
You know I need this.

01:17:48.793 --> 01:17:49.795
Is this you?

01:17:53.842 --> 01:17:56.193
Just tell me if this is you.

01:18:02.634 --> 01:18:05.114
[car beeping]

01:18:12.164 --> 01:18:14.427
[knocking]

01:18:38.887 --> 01:18:40.063
- House rules.

01:18:41.106 --> 01:18:43.631
- Ain't no need for that, bro.

01:18:47.025 --> 01:18:48.636
- Well, well.

01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:49.854
- [David] Allison.

01:18:49.899 --> 01:18:51.900
- Long time no see.

01:18:51.944 --> 01:18:54.467
- [David] Yeah, is Conner here.

01:18:54.511 --> 01:18:57.122
- Of course, he's here.

01:18:57.167 --> 01:19:00.604
Well, you look good, haven't
changed much.

01:19:00.648 --> 01:19:02.389
Except for that ring.

01:19:03.826 --> 01:19:06.045
- Hi, Dane, chill out, man.

01:19:07.264 --> 01:19:10.180
What's up, David, how you
doing, man, thanks for coming.

01:19:10.222 --> 01:19:13.530
Oh, I see you met my people
here.

01:19:13.573 --> 01:19:15.793
Well, you know Allison, right?

01:19:15.837 --> 01:19:18.056
Anyway, this guy right here,

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:21.626
me and him used to see some
fire, man.

01:19:21.668 --> 01:19:23.759
I miss hanging out with you,
man.

01:19:23.801 --> 01:19:25.672
You know, we could do work.

01:19:25.716 --> 01:19:28.502
If you come back, you'd be
like royalty around here.

01:19:28.546 --> 01:19:31.027
- No, I'm not interested, man.

01:19:32.854 --> 01:19:34.595
- Allison, can you get
this man his package,

01:19:34.639 --> 01:19:36.640
so he can be on his way?

01:19:37.685 --> 01:19:40.340
Family drama, they need 'em now.

01:19:43.256 --> 01:19:44.823
She's so slow, man.

01:19:45.823 --> 01:19:47.216
Want a drink?

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:48.087
- No.

01:19:49.567 --> 01:19:51.569
- Well, more for me.

01:19:51.612 --> 01:19:54.528
Hey, Dane, so check this out,

01:19:54.572 --> 01:19:58.010
me and David over here go so far
back,

01:19:58.054 --> 01:20:01.666
we were like 12, 13 years
old, our teacher, right,

01:20:01.708 --> 01:20:02.797
Mr. Robinson was it?

01:20:02.841 --> 01:20:04.712
Yeah, Mr. Robinson taught us how
to box

01:20:04.756 --> 01:20:07.890
and he thought he was my muscle,
okay?

01:20:12.416 --> 01:20:13.329
We made some real money, though.

01:20:13.372 --> 01:20:15.113
- Here you go, David.

01:20:18.161 --> 01:20:20.685
- Hey, this stuff ain't cheap.

01:20:22.338 --> 01:20:23.862
- What are these keys for?

01:20:23.905 --> 01:20:25.863
- Oh, you and Dane are gonna go

01:20:25.908 --> 01:20:27.518
on a little adventure, I think.

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:30.520
- Oh, man, I knew I
shouldn't have come here.

01:20:30.564 --> 01:20:32.479
- [Conner] Dude, it's not like
that, man.

01:20:32.523 --> 01:20:34.438
- You're out of your mind, man.

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:37.354
- It's a favor for favor,
it's not a big deal, man.

01:20:37.396 --> 01:20:40.051
- [David] No, no, no,
take this, take the keys,

01:20:40.095 --> 01:20:43.838
take your money, and
find another errand boy.

01:20:44.708 --> 01:20:48.626
- I told you, it's not
like that, we're family.

01:20:50.019 --> 01:20:52.020
Come on, come on, David.

01:20:57.287 --> 01:20:59.376
- You know it's funny how much
has changed

01:20:59.418 --> 01:21:00.725
and how much is still the same,

01:21:00.768 --> 01:21:02.900
man, I came here thinking
you would help me,

01:21:02.944 --> 01:21:06.382
now I see you're in no position
to help me or anybody else.

01:21:06.426 --> 01:21:09.386
- [Conner] Oh, it's like that?

01:21:09.429 --> 01:21:12.605
- That's right, I feel sorry for
you, man.

01:21:12.649 --> 01:21:16.305
- You come to my house,
asking me for money,

01:21:16.349 --> 01:21:17.610
and you feel sorry for me.

01:21:17.654 --> 01:21:20.484
[Conner laughing]

01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:22.137
Apologize.

01:21:23.617 --> 01:21:26.663
Apologize to me for insulting me

01:21:26.707 --> 01:21:29.057
in front of my friends in my own
house,

01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:31.668
then take the package, take the
keys,

01:21:31.712 --> 01:21:34.105
and do what I tell you to do.

01:21:35.238 --> 01:21:37.893
That's it, we're still the same.

01:21:40.503 --> 01:21:44.681
- I used to be like you,
I'm so glad I'm not no more.

01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:48.425
I don't miss one minute of it.

01:21:48.467 --> 01:21:52.211
- I know you miss that money,
though?

01:21:52.255 --> 01:21:54.344
And I know your pretty wife
and your pretty daughter

01:21:54.386 --> 01:21:56.041
are gonna miss that.

01:22:00.524 --> 01:22:03.787
Put the gun down, chill out,
Dane.

01:22:03.831 --> 01:22:05.398
Chill out, put the gun down.

01:22:05.442 --> 01:22:07.661
It's all right, we just playin',
we just playin', all right.

01:22:07.704 --> 01:22:09.619
Allison, towel.

01:22:09.662 --> 01:22:10.489
Towel.

01:22:12.318 --> 01:22:14.277
- Conner, you stay away from me

01:22:14.319 --> 01:22:16.931
and you stay away from my
family.

01:22:16.975 --> 01:22:18.194
- [Conner] Come on, David.

01:22:18.237 --> 01:22:21.197
David, we're family, right?

01:22:21.239 --> 01:22:22.502
- Try me.

01:22:22.546 --> 01:22:23.850
Family.

01:22:23.895 --> 01:22:25.591
- I was joking.

01:22:25.636 --> 01:22:27.899
I was joking, man.

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:29.073
We're through?

01:22:44.568 --> 01:22:45.569
- Okay, God.

01:22:48.006 --> 01:22:50.703
You got my attention, you got
it.

01:22:52.576 --> 01:22:55.012
I don't know where else to turn.

01:22:55.056 --> 01:22:57.711
I don't have an answer for that.

01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:02.412
I don't know where to turn.

01:24:12.481 --> 01:24:15.528
Get away from my car, man, is
that my bag?

01:24:15.572 --> 01:24:17.747
Is that my bag on you, yo?

01:24:20.359 --> 01:24:21.881
Give me bag.

01:24:21.926 --> 01:24:24.015
- What are you doing?

01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:25.320
- Give me my bag, man.

01:24:25.363 --> 01:24:27.104
- Why you chasing me?

01:24:28.237 --> 01:24:29.324
That's not yo bag.

01:24:29.368 --> 01:24:30.542
- Give me my bag, homie.

01:24:30.587 --> 01:24:31.457
- That's not yo bag.

01:24:31.501 --> 01:24:32.371
- [David] Hey, give me my bag.

01:24:32.414 --> 01:24:34.069
- That's not yo bag.

01:24:34.112 --> 01:24:35.243
- What's this?

01:24:39.335 --> 01:24:40.162
- Yeah.

01:24:43.774 --> 01:24:44.948
That's my bag.

01:24:50.475 --> 01:24:52.347
- It's your daughter, right?

01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:53.217
- What?

01:24:54.958 --> 01:24:56.220
- I've seen you and your wife

01:24:56.265 --> 01:25:00.181
carrying your daughter
in and out of the house.

01:25:00.225 --> 01:25:01.225
Is she sick?

01:25:03.881 --> 01:25:04.881
- Yeah, man.

01:25:08.233 --> 01:25:09.104
Yeah, man.

01:25:11.409 --> 01:25:12.845
- She got cancer?

01:25:18.547 --> 01:25:22.291
- My wife had cancer,
too, God rest her soul.

01:25:26.207 --> 01:25:29.645
I've been praying for your
daughter

01:25:29.689 --> 01:25:32.170
and I'm gonna keep on praying.

01:25:33.953 --> 01:25:36.869
[David stammering]

01:25:38.262 --> 01:25:39.872
- It ain't nothing.

01:25:40.961 --> 01:25:42.180
I ain't nobody.

01:25:46.314 --> 01:25:50.100
I'm gonna take my bag
and go on about my way.

01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:12.515
- David, what are you doing?

01:26:12.557 --> 01:26:14.212
Why'd you run off like that?

01:26:14.256 --> 01:26:15.779
- Baby, I'm sorry.

01:26:16.693 --> 01:26:17.780
I'm so sorry.

01:26:18.912 --> 01:26:21.131
- [Alexis] It's okay.

01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:24.179
- Baby, Conner, I went down
there, I went downtown--

01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:25.962
- Oh, the nurse is here.

01:26:26.006 --> 01:26:27.051
- Mr. Medford.

01:26:27.094 --> 01:26:28.618
- Hey, good to meet you.

01:26:28.661 --> 01:26:30.445
My wife will show you in,
I gotta get cleaned up.

01:26:30.488 --> 01:26:32.448
- Okay, hi, I'm Lynn Popovich.

01:26:32.490 --> 01:26:34.189
- Hey, Alexis.

01:26:34.231 --> 01:26:35.145
Please, come in.

01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:36.015
- Okay.

01:26:37.234 --> 01:26:38.061
Thank you.

01:26:39.454 --> 01:26:41.326
You have a beautiful home.

01:26:41.369 --> 01:26:42.719
- Thank you.

01:26:42.761 --> 01:26:45.591
- Please forgive me for
dropping by unannounced,

01:26:45.635 --> 01:26:47.202
I have a flight to catch

01:26:47.244 --> 01:26:49.551
and I promised I would come here
first.

01:26:49.595 --> 01:26:53.251
- I'm sorry, I thought
you were someone else,

01:26:53.295 --> 01:26:55.600
so you're not the nurse?

01:26:55.645 --> 01:26:56.471
- No.

01:26:57.603 --> 01:26:58.430
No.

01:26:59.909 --> 01:27:03.869
No, your husband met my
husband Peter a few days ago.

01:27:03.913 --> 01:27:06.264
- I'm sorry, what did
you say your name was?

01:27:06.307 --> 01:27:08.135
- Lynn, Lynn Popovich.

01:27:09.746 --> 01:27:14.619
My husband and I, we were
set to be divorced next week

01:27:14.663 --> 01:27:16.404
and long story short,

01:27:18.667 --> 01:27:21.323
your husband spoke to my husband

01:27:23.846 --> 01:27:26.502
and whatever he said changed him

01:27:29.853 --> 01:27:32.029
and it saved our marriage.

01:27:33.595 --> 01:27:37.729
Anyway, he made me promise to
deliver this to your husband

01:27:39.166 --> 01:27:42.560
and I was really hoping to
give it to him personally,

01:27:42.604 --> 01:27:45.216
but I can see that he was busy.

01:27:46.695 --> 01:27:50.873
Could you at least tell him
that Peter and I said thank you?

01:27:53.746 --> 01:27:54.573
- Yeah.

01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:58.751
- Anyway, I should probably get
going.

01:27:58.795 --> 01:28:00.926
Peter and I, we're
actually renewing our vows

01:28:00.970 --> 01:28:03.189
in Italy this weekend.

01:28:03.234 --> 01:28:04.627
I know.

01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:07.368
He's really extravagant.

01:28:07.412 --> 01:28:09.501
Thank you so much for your time.

01:28:09.545 --> 01:28:11.460
- Of course, thank you.

01:28:36.266 --> 01:28:37.659
David!

01:28:37.703 --> 01:28:38.573
- [David] Yeah?

01:28:38.617 --> 01:28:40.488
- Can you come open this letter?

01:28:40.532 --> 01:28:42.359
- [David] What letter?

01:28:54.067 --> 01:28:54.894
- Here.

01:29:02.554 --> 01:29:04.381
Read it out loud.

01:29:04.426 --> 01:29:07.645
- Dear David, I don't know where
to begin,

01:29:07.689 --> 01:29:10.213
so I'll start at the end.

01:29:10.256 --> 01:29:13.347
My wife and I are back together.

01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:15.654
One clandestine evening
while grocery shopping,

01:29:15.698 --> 01:29:18.353
I bumped into a man on a
journey,

01:29:18.395 --> 01:29:19.918
little did he know that my plan

01:29:19.962 --> 01:29:22.966
was to kill myself to spite my
wife.

01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:29.145
I procrastinated long
enough to run into you,

01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:33.368
a complete stranger willing to
listen to an old man ramble.

01:29:34.368 --> 01:29:35.282
We prayed for--

01:29:35.326 --> 01:29:36.849
- [Peter] Something happen.

01:29:36.893 --> 01:29:39.895
On my way home, something
urged me to pull the car over

01:29:39.939 --> 01:29:42.332
and kneel in the grass.

01:29:42.377 --> 01:29:45.030
I repeated the words
that you prayed for me,

01:29:45.074 --> 01:29:47.947
that God would change my life.

01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:49.600
I didn't know it at the time,

01:29:49.645 --> 01:29:52.342
but when I got up, I wasn't the
same,

01:29:52.386 --> 01:29:54.389
God gave me a new heart.

01:29:56.694 --> 01:29:59.045
I had been afraid of not
having control of my life

01:29:59.088 --> 01:30:02.309
and guess what, I'm not afraid
anymore.

01:30:05.617 --> 01:30:08.185
I don't know why you
listened to me that day

01:30:08.228 --> 01:30:11.144
and I wanted to call and thank
you.

01:30:12.189 --> 01:30:13.712
I found your info on the
paperwork

01:30:13.756 --> 01:30:17.063
that you must've dropped in my
car.

01:30:17.106 --> 01:30:19.935
I'm on the board of several
organizations.

01:30:19.979 --> 01:30:22.417
- Angel Wings is one of them.

01:30:25.506 --> 01:30:27.682
- [Peter] If you send your
application in,

01:30:27.725 --> 01:30:30.467
I'll push it through
immediately.

01:30:32.818 --> 01:30:35.994
You'll find a thank you note
attached.

01:30:36.822 --> 01:30:41.000
Trust me, what you did for
me, I can never repay you.

01:30:42.175 --> 01:30:44.481
- Sincerely, Peter Popovich.

01:30:49.181 --> 01:30:50.444
- Is this real?

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:54.752
Is this a check for $50,000?

01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:58.627
- Wait a minute.

01:31:00.628 --> 01:31:01.456
Baby.

01:31:01.498 --> 01:31:02.805
- Who does this?

01:31:10.203 --> 01:31:11.161
- Oh my god.

01:31:11.203 --> 01:31:13.685
- A check for $50,000.

01:31:13.729 --> 01:31:16.514
Who does this, who does this?

01:31:16.557 --> 01:31:17.471
- God does.

01:31:23.652 --> 01:31:25.175
He answered, baby.

01:31:28.439 --> 01:31:31.006
When darkness falls on dreary
night

01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:33.399
and the wind beats against my
window,

01:31:33.444 --> 01:31:35.751
I rest assured that even then

01:31:35.793 --> 01:31:38.493
there are angels all around.

01:31:38.536 --> 01:31:40.582
When the fear of loneliness
lingers

01:31:40.625 --> 01:31:42.497
and my heart begins to ache,

01:31:42.539 --> 01:31:44.760
I can rest assured that even
then

01:31:44.802 --> 01:31:47.457
there are angels all around.

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:50.199
It's love, your love that
comforts me

01:31:50.243 --> 01:31:52.854
and nothing else compares.

01:31:52.898 --> 01:31:54.203
You are my shelter

01:31:54.247 --> 01:31:57.423
and I know you've placed
the angels all around.

01:31:57.467 --> 01:32:00.210
[hopeful melody]
