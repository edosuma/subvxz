<i>Be humble.</i>

07:54.150 --> 07:56.326
<i>I became a soldier because
I wanted to be in battles...</i>

07:56.427 --> 07:58.912
<i>And now, what about the battles?</i>

07:59.013 --> 08:01.715
<i>Much better to be at home
with wife and kids instead.</i>

08:06.437 --> 08:07.712
<i>My daughter...</i>

<i>The reason a soldier is respected...</i>

10:35.252 --> 10:37.871
<i>Is not because of
the uniform he wears...</i>

10:38.214 --> 10:40.949
<i>But is because of the sense
of duty he carries.</i>

10:41.592 --> 10:45.020
<i>With or without the uniform,
the duty remains.</i>

10:45.304 --> 10:47.714
<i>And he continues to be respected.</i>

If your godfather tells
your mother about this...

<i>I've asked all the chiefs.
More than half of Africa.</i>

16:52.254 --> 16:55.982
<i>And nobody has seen that bullet before.</i>

16:56.383 --> 17:00.504
<i>I will find it, even if I have
to scour the entire continent.</i>

17:19.848 --> 17:21.665
<i>Dear fellow countrymen...</i>

17:21.767 --> 17:24.430
<i>My deepest condolences
to the families...</i>

17:24.454 --> 17:27.079
<i>Their loved ones during batchka
village incident.</i>

17:27.156 --> 17:28.181
<i>Early today...</i>

17:28.281 --> 17:31.325
<i>The red scarf rebel army claimed
responsibility for the batchka village.</i>

17:31.376 --> 17:33.311
<i>Our government condemns
their barbaric behavior.</i>

17:33.412 --> 17:39.209
<i>Our homeland has been attacked on multiple
occasions. These are great tragedies.</i>

17:41.011 --> 17:46.624
<i>The rebels continue to advance as the
country grapples with the lamanla outbreak.</i>

17:46.725 --> 17:48.680
<i>As your government,
we will not back down.</i>

17:48.705 --> 17:51.069
<i>The great people's army
will fight to the very end.</i>

<i>Quarantine have been set up
across the country...</i>

17:54.316 --> 17:57.009
<i>In an attempt to contain

<i>We have declared a state of emergency.</i>

18:12.626 --> 18:13.660
Hey, brother.

18:14.044 --> 18:15.854
You shorted me 300 bucks.

18:17.089 --> 18:18.865
Be careful with that.

18:20.384 --> 18:22.510
Look, we're both Chinese.

18:22.911 --> 18:24.763
You do this to your own people?

18:25.138 --> 18:29.526
Since 3 pm on the 14th of last month,
I am no longer officially Chinese.

18:31.562 --> 18:32.612
What?

18:32.813 --> 18:34.506
Fresh off the boat?

18:37.317 --> 18:38.669
Hear that?

18:39.111 --> 18:40.996
In times like this...

18:41.280 --> 18:43.381
That's the price you get.

18:48.036 --> 18:49.729
Seen this before?

18:52.916 --> 18:54.076
Nope.

18:56.420 --> 18:59.038
I've been told that it came
from these parts.

19:00.991 --> 19:02.533
Definitely never seen it.

19:02.634 --> 19:03.877
Hey boss.

19:05.287 --> 19:06.704

We're Chinese.

22:54.825 --> 22:56.475
What about us? What're we suppose to do?

22:56.576 --> 22:59.019
- Will they accept us?
- Hard to say.

22:59.120 --> 23:02.057
- That's our country.
- Everybody follow me.

23:06.294 --> 23:07.300

Go, hurry.

27:25.678 --> 27:26.705
Go.

27:30.225 --> 27:31.359
Fall back!

27:36.523 --> 27:38.183
Help! Help!

29:02.984 --> 29:06.762
Commander, all foreign vessels
are leaving the war zone.

29:06.863 --> 29:07.888
The harbor is unsafe.

29:54.327 --> 29:56.311
The entire country's in chaos.

29:56.412 --> 29:59.273
The war has destroyed lives
of many of countrymen.

29:59.374 --> 30:01.567
Can you send our troops in to help?

30:01.668 --> 30:03.393
Without the UN's authorization...

30:03.494 --> 30:06.355
Our troops aren't permitted
to enter the war zone.

30:09.175 --> 30:11.201
Ok, slow, no.62.

But I believe you have not
forgotten about the help...

Let's go!

31:19.620 --> 31:21.864

- Look at me.
- I want my mom!

31:58.576 --> 31:59.618
I want my mom!

31:59.719 --> 32:01.787
Trust me. Trust your godfather.

32:02.038 --> 32:04.206
- Ok? Trust your godfather!
<i>- Hey brother.</i>

32:06.526 --> 32:08.411
What are you doing down here?

32:08.544 --> 32:11.822
There's something I have to tell you.

32:12.173 --> 32:13.925
That bullet...

32:14.242 --> 32:15.826
I've seen it before.

32:16.094 --> 32:17.452
That pattern...

32:17.553 --> 32:20.840
Is a symbol used by the rebel forces.

32:21.891 --> 32:23.792
An arm dealer friend of mine told me...

32:23.893 --> 32:27.363
The rebels have hired the most
expensive mercenaries out of Europe.

32:27.588 --> 32:29.923
Whatever grudge you've got against them...

32:30.024 --> 32:32.634
I urge you,
don't go seeking death.

32:32.735 --> 32:36.054
47 Chinese workers! Are still stuck
at the hanbond Chinese factory.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.265
What's worse, dr, chen is stuck 55 km...

32:38.316 --> 32:40.275
Behind enemy lines
on a medical relief mission

32:40.326 --> 32:42.477
he's a high value target
for the rebel army.

32:42.578 --> 32:45.605
Everything is in total lockdown
from lochino to St. Francis.

32:45.706 --> 32:47.232
Without UN's authorization...

32:47.333 --> 32:49.985
My troops aren't allowed
to enter the war zone.

32:50.086 --> 32:51.862
This operation is highly important!

32:51.963 --> 32:54.114
We have to evacuate those Chinese workers!

32:54.215 --> 32:55.724
And Dr. Chen by all means!

32:55.825 --> 32:57.034
Under current circumstances...

32:57.075 --> 32:59.484
Combat troops are prohibited
from entering the war zone!

32:59.545 --> 33:03.165
In order to complete the evacuation,
someone has to undertake the mission alone!

33:03.266 --> 33:05.468
- I'll go.
- Stop right there! What's your purpose?

33:08.563 --> 33:10.547
Former pla, south-east region...

33:10.648 --> 33:13.142
Special ops brigade,
wolf warrior squadron...

33:13.401 --> 33:14.560
Leng feng.

33:15.403 --> 33:17.688
This child's mother is
at hanbond Chinese factory.

33:18.030 --> 33:20.607
I know approximately where it is located.

33:25.872 --> 33:27.740
I promise you...

33:28.332 --> 33:30.868
I will bring your mom back.

33:36.657 --> 33:38.825
We took care of business now, didn't we?

33:38.926 --> 33:41.912
Ambassador Thomas,
king Angola, prince drew.

33:42.013 --> 33:44.590
That goddamn communications manager.

33:44.849 --> 33:49.002
They're all gone.
They all disappeared, real mysteriously!

33:49.103 --> 33:51.963
<i>Stop wasting my time with that crap!</i>

33:52.064 --> 33:54.350
<i>Where's Dr. Chen?</i>

33:55.109 --> 33:56.469
Ah, Jesus.

34:12.627 --> 34:14.829
You tell him what you told me.

34:15.129 --> 34:16.664
Dr. Chen...

34:16.797 --> 34:20.710
Is at St. Francis
Chinese invested hospital.

34:21.135 --> 34:22.553
Good boy.

34:30.978 --> 34:32.538
Did you hear that?

34:33.231 --> 34:35.899
That could be sound of the future.

34:42.697 --> 34:46.726
Sir, why are we helping
these fucking idiots?

34:46.827 --> 34:49.271
Welcome to Africa, son.

34:49.914 --> 34:52.190
Alright, let's move out boys!

35:10.768 --> 35:14.963
<i>From the latest report, the fighting
is reaching semshalemu harbor.</i>

35:15.064 --> 35:18.842
<i>The urgency of the evacuating
1536 Chinese nationals waiting there...</i>

35:18.943 --> 35:20.343
<i>Has just been escalated.</i>

35:20.444 --> 35:22.721
<i>Our vessels are heading over at top speed.</i>

35:22.822 --> 35:25.474
<i>My apologies, because
the conflict is on foreign soil...</i>

35:25.575 --> 35:30.103
<i>You'll have no reinforcements,
no allies and no weapons.</i>

35:30.204 --> 35:31.288
<i>Dr. Chen...</i>

35:31.389 --> 35:34.784
<i>And 47 Chinese workers,
evacuate them all.</i>

36:09.577 --> 36:11.670
My boss asked me...

36:11.871 --> 36:13.948
To find Dr. Chen.

36:14.123 --> 36:16.325
Nobody wants to do anything!

36:16.792 --> 36:20.195
Now, I have to try my luck.

36:20.296 --> 36:21.747
Because...

36:22.048 --> 36:23.281
I have...

36:23.382 --> 36:25.192
A special vision.

36:26.177 --> 36:28.020
Let me guess...

36:53.454 --> 36:55.297
Are you Dr. Chen?

36:55.498 --> 36:56.856
I'm not! I'm not!

36:56.957 --> 36:58.859
Are you Dr. Chen?

36:59.710 --> 37:00.860
Are you Dr. Chen?

37:00.961 --> 37:02.045
No, no, no.

37:02.146 --> 37:03.630
She's a child, just a child.

37:03.731 --> 37:04.940
<i>I am.</i>

37:05.549 --> 37:06.676
No.

37:08.678 --> 37:09.804
No.

37:14.141 --> 37:15.935
I'm Dr. Chen.

37:22.358 --> 37:24.602
You are Dr. Chen?

37:24.944 --> 37:28.272
Looks like Dr. Chen doesn't have balls.

37:28.614 --> 37:30.065
What do you want?

37:30.324 --> 37:32.776
- I am Dr. Chen.
- Dr. Rachel, no!

37:34.995 --> 37:36.855
She's not Dr. Chen.

37:36.956 --> 37:39.065
She's a very good doctor.

37:39.166 --> 37:41.185
She saved so many lives.

37:42.044 --> 37:43.138
No!

37:51.512 --> 37:53.055
Dr. Chen!

37:53.389 --> 37:54.607
Papa!

37:57.309 --> 37:59.261
You just killed...

37:59.562 --> 38:00.989
Dr. Chen.

38:02.982 --> 38:05.259
- Papa!
- Dr. Chen!

39:42.873 --> 39:44.391
Dr. Chen, right?

39:44.625 --> 39:47.452
I was sent by ambassador fan to rescue you.

39:50.114 --> 39:51.948
This is my daughter, pasha.

39:52.049 --> 39:54.585
Please, I beg you, protect her.

39:59.557 --> 40:01.417
- Dr. Chen!
- Dr. Chen!

40:02.309 --> 40:04.127
Come with me!

40:04.728 --> 40:05.980
Get in the car!

40:30.880 --> 40:32.064
Go fast!

40:40.014 --> 40:41.372
What are you doing?

40:41.473 --> 40:44.443
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm saving your ass!

40:56.113 --> 40:57.523
Let me drive!

40:58.407 --> 40:59.558
Move!

41:53.379 --> 41:54.480
What the hell!

41:57.216 --> 41:58.319
Turn around!

41:59.551 --> 42:01.079
Go, go, go!

42:32.292 --> 42:33.292
Jesus.

43:16.003 --> 43:17.021
Pasha!

44:31.954 --> 44:33.155
Are you okay?

44:34.248 --> 44:35.406
Are you okay?

44:35.707 --> 44:36.909
Are you okay?

44:47.886 --> 44:49.129
Are you okay?

44:52.391 --> 44:53.609
Are you okay?

44:54.184 --> 44:55.261
Yeah.

44:56.520 --> 45:00.941
Pasha...

45:06.780 --> 45:07.790
Stop!

45:09.700 --> 45:10.709
Stop!

45:22.963 --> 45:24.105
You want food?

45:24.206 --> 45:25.640
We have food.

45:25.841 --> 45:27.600
We have food, okay?

45:27.801 --> 45:29.253
We have food.

45:59.416 --> 46:00.734
Are you okay?

46:19.978 --> 46:21.021
Thank you.

46:26.360 --> 46:28.745
Is that from quarantine zone?

46:29.138 --> 46:31.340
Pasha, can you please hand me the bag?

46:31.698 --> 46:34.567
I said, did you get that
in the quarantine zone?

46:37.204 --> 46:38.246
It's nothing.

46:38.347 --> 46:40.690
I'm not overreacting.

46:40.791 --> 46:42.358
In fact, it's better if I was.

46:42.459 --> 46:45.570
Those people back there were
infected with the lamanla virus.

46:45.671 --> 46:51.325
Symptoms include the sudden onset fever,
hallucinations, lesions, cold sweats.

46:51.426 --> 46:54.662
It's a fatal virus that's transmitted
through direct human contact.

46:54.763 --> 46:57.999
Upon contraction, death strikes between
four hours and five months.

46:58.100 --> 47:01.470
Up until now, no cure has been found.

47:02.187 --> 47:04.298
Don't worry, I'm insured.

47:23.792 --> 47:25.936
You're killing the Chinese?

47:26.878 --> 47:28.613
This is a big trouble.

47:28.814 --> 47:31.391
Why are you killing the Chinese?

47:33.885 --> 47:34.952
Sir...

47:35.053 --> 47:37.580
I thought you wanted Dr. Chen.

47:38.473 --> 47:39.858
Congratulations.

47:40.392 --> 47:42.035
You found him.

47:45.122 --> 47:46.140
Fuck!

47:46.898 --> 47:48.883
I wanted him alive!

47:48.984 --> 47:50.176
Alive!

47:50.277 --> 47:54.405
Don't you understand
how important it is to me?

47:57.367 --> 47:58.418
Fuck!

48:01.747 --> 48:02.773
Wait.

48:03.665 --> 48:05.058
That girl.

48:06.710 --> 48:07.995
I like her.

48:08.670 --> 48:11.125
Sir, our facial recognition
crew uploaded video...

48:11.250 --> 48:13.574
Of this man fighting off
some of the pirates.

48:13.775 --> 48:15.335
His name's leng.

48:15.635 --> 48:18.788
Ex-member of a secretive
special ops unit pot of China.

48:18.889 --> 48:20.407
Wolf warrior.

48:21.016 --> 48:22.025
Boys!

48:32.402 --> 48:35.096
The doctors without borders
were killed by armed mercenaries.

48:35.197 --> 48:38.182
The lives of Dr. Cheng and other
Chinese medical staff were sacrificed.

48:38.283 --> 48:41.269
<i>Comrade leng,</i>
do you stand by what are you're saying?

48:41.370 --> 48:45.898
<i>Are you certain you witnessed
the massacre or our medical team?</i>

48:45.999 --> 48:47.166
I'm certain.

48:47.267 --> 48:49.986
Dr. Chen give me his daughter
before he died.

48:50.087 --> 48:52.956
An African girl. Her name is pasha.

48:53.090 --> 48:55.324
Oh, and a nurse too.
What's your name?

48:55.425 --> 48:58.327
Rachel Prescott Smith.
You can call me Rachel.

48:58.428 --> 49:00.798
Doctor Rachel, I'm not a nurse.

49:01.498 --> 49:03.708
Report the situation to
ambassador fan immediately.

49:03.809 --> 49:04.884
Yes sir.

49:05.961 --> 49:08.246
Commander, may I speak to my son please?

49:08.797 --> 49:09.880
<i>Godfather, godfather!</i>

49:09.981 --> 49:11.240
<i>Where's my mom?</i>

49:11.341 --> 49:12.658
Hey, <i>tundu, tundu!</i>

49:12.859 --> 49:14.385
<i>Trust me. Trust your godfather.</i>

49:14.486 --> 49:19.265
<i>We are going to hanbond Chinese factory
to find your mom right now, okay?</i>

49:19.366 --> 49:21.434
Thank you, <i>godfather.</i>

49:21.535 --> 49:24.312
<i>Leng,</i> I have some bad news for you.

49:24.413 --> 49:28.899
<i>The rebel army is sabotaging all
major roads, railways and Bridges.</i>

49:29.000 --> 49:30.401
<i>As of 10 minutes ago...</i>

49:30.502 --> 49:34.196
<i>Your only route to the port,
the bowerneja bridge, was bombed.</i>

49:34.297 --> 49:36.924
<i>We are formulating an escape plan now.</i>

49:37.025 --> 49:39.628
<i>But until then, you're on your own.</i>

49:39.886 --> 49:41.078
Set your watch.

49:41.179 --> 49:43.789
<i>The maximum time we can wait is 18 hours.</i>

49:43.890 --> 49:46.000
<i>After that, we'll be forced to leave.</i>

49:46.101 --> 49:47.501
<i>My deepest apologies.</i>

49:47.602 --> 49:50.254
<i>I have the responsibility
to everyone on board.</i>

49:50.355 --> 49:51.523
I understand.

49:55.277 --> 49:57.312
You're going to the Chinese factory?

49:57.571 --> 50:00.014
We should go to the American consulate.

50:00.115 --> 50:03.568
The us marines are stationed there.
That's our safest bet.

50:03.785 --> 50:06.854
You think the us marines
are the best in the world?

50:06.955 --> 50:09.307
That may be true, but where are they now?

50:09.566 --> 50:11.359
I've informed the consulate
of the situation.

50:11.460 --> 50:12.844
Where are they?

50:13.462 --> 50:15.045
Tell me exactly how you informed them?

50:15.146 --> 50:17.499
I tweeted at them on Twitter.

50:24.831 --> 50:26.582
<i>Welcome to American consulate.</i>

50:26.683 --> 50:28.384
<i>Unfortunately, we are closed.</i>

50:28.485 --> 50:29.536
Fuck!

50:33.648 --> 50:36.859
All foreign Navy ships
have left when I arrived.

50:37.068 --> 50:39.854
A I watch them sail away from port.

50:40.113 --> 50:42.773
Among the countless departing masts.

50:43.033 --> 50:45.610
I saw one with the stars and stripes.

50:48.788 --> 50:50.098
Stop the car.

50:50.832 --> 50:52.058
Stop the car!

50:52.417 --> 50:54.836
Stop the car, I want to get out! Stop!

51:10.894 --> 51:12.054
Rachel.

51:28.745 --> 51:31.414
Your gis are here to get you.

52:54.748 --> 52:56.249
I'm Chinese.

52:56.625 --> 52:58.543
I'm here for nessa.

52:58.918 --> 53:00.395
Tundu's mom.

53:03.340 --> 53:04.391
Nessa!

53:16.728 --> 53:18.237
Anyone home?

53:18.438 --> 53:20.473
I've been sent here to rescue you.

53:20.982 --> 53:23.359
By ambassador fan himself.

53:26.571 --> 53:27.756
You?

53:28.490 --> 53:29.924
Rescue us?

53:39.584 --> 53:41.828
<i>I've got 18 ak-47s.</i>

53:42.379 --> 53:44.664
<i>30 m79 grenade launchers...</i>

53:45.215 --> 53:47.809
<i>Enough to arm a platoon.</i>

53:50.720 --> 53:54.591
<i>I have a m1911 pointed at
your head right now.</i>

53:55.066 --> 53:56.875
<i>How the fuck are you supposed
to rescue us?</i>

53:56.976 --> 53:58.210
Leng, leng!

53:58.311 --> 53:59.587
Are you leng?

53:59.688 --> 54:01.046
Are you leng?

54:01.147 --> 54:02.631
- Nessa?
- Yes, yes, yes!

54:02.732 --> 54:03.924
What about my son?

54:04.025 --> 54:05.175
- He's safe.
- He's okay?

54:05.276 --> 54:06.486
He's okay.

54:08.697 --> 54:11.433
Oh, thank god!

54:12.909 --> 54:14.360
He's okay.

54:14.661 --> 54:16.186
<i>Mom, I'm ok, I'm ok!</i>

54:16.287 --> 54:19.815
- Oh, thank god!
<i>- Mom, I'm ok!</i>

54:19.916 --> 54:22.735
Because you're on a Chinese warship.

54:22.836 --> 54:25.554
I told you, not to sell that porn.

54:25.655 --> 54:26.655
Here we go.

54:26.756 --> 54:29.158
You definitely won't find better
dumplings in Africa.

54:29.259 --> 54:30.659
I flew in a chef from China.

54:30.760 --> 54:32.621
- Fresh, just for you.
- Thank you.

54:34.681 --> 54:36.915
What are you looking at?
Seen one before?

54:37.016 --> 54:38.593
Ever shot one of these?

54:39.018 --> 54:42.831
This wolf here,
I killed myself with this gun.

54:43.314 --> 54:45.366
Who drew this map?

54:45.859 --> 54:48.594
I instructed our head of security,
Lao he, how to do it.

54:48.695 --> 54:50.605
It still needs some work.

54:50.947 --> 54:51.997
Lao he...

54:52.198 --> 54:54.225
Come here for a second.

54:54.809 --> 54:58.896
Sector a to sector d.
I've told you so many times.

54:59.789 --> 55:02.216
Why isn't it done yet?

55:02.717 --> 55:04.568
- I'll get on it right away.
- Lao he...

55:04.669 --> 55:06.403
Write it down quickly.

55:06.504 --> 55:07.613
As our head of security.

55:07.714 --> 55:09.690
What if something happens
during the operation?

55:09.791 --> 55:11.142
Then what?

55:15.764 --> 55:18.057
This is a real man's toy.

55:21.778 --> 55:22.878
Don't be afraid.

55:22.979 --> 55:26.131
From now on, your safety
will be my responsibility.

55:26.232 --> 55:27.591
Leng, thank you!

55:27.692 --> 55:30.061
- You're welcome.
- Thank you so much!

55:30.361 --> 55:31.738
You're welcome.

55:32.363 --> 55:33.515
Thank you.

55:35.408 --> 55:36.684
Hey, kiddo.

55:36.785 --> 55:39.061
It's super yummy try this.

55:40.146 --> 55:41.271
Hey! You brat!

55:41.372 --> 55:43.107
I'm fine. What's the big deal?

55:43.208 --> 55:45.418
I think she's kind of cute.

55:46.294 --> 55:48.654
Good news.
Ambassador fan just called.

55:48.755 --> 55:52.448
Tomorrow 07:00 am, a UN rescue helicopter
will be landing at this factory...

55:52.549 --> 55:53.967
To evacuate us.

55:54.068 --> 55:55.211
Just one?

55:59.432 --> 56:01.500
Attention please.

56:01.601 --> 56:03.627
Everybody.

56:03.728 --> 56:06.848
Everybody listen to me.

56:07.982 --> 56:11.144
Quiet down everyone.
Listen to me.

56:11.277 --> 56:14.430
All Chinese employees,
stand on this side.

56:14.531 --> 56:16.473
We are only taking Chinese people.

56:16.574 --> 56:19.101
Management goes first.

56:19.202 --> 56:20.644
I will lead the evacuation.

56:20.745 --> 56:21.770
Is that clear?

56:21.871 --> 56:26.200
All the africans
please stand this side, please.

56:26.376 --> 56:27.568
Clear?

56:27.669 --> 56:28.711
Harry.

56:30.088 --> 56:32.264
- No, boss, no.
- Please.

56:32.465 --> 56:33.507
Come on, come on.

56:33.608 --> 56:36.820
Get moving.

56:37.762 --> 56:42.050
Anyone else? Come, move.
That side. That side.

56:42.308 --> 56:45.335
- What are you doing?
- She's my wife. She's pregnant. Look.

56:45.436 --> 56:47.263
Any more Chinese?

56:47.480 --> 56:49.548
Any other Chinese?

56:49.649 --> 56:51.967
Lin, listen to me.

56:52.068 --> 56:53.978
Everyone here is my employee.

56:54.320 --> 56:56.564
I'm taking them all with me.

56:58.908 --> 57:00.402
How?

57:03.913 --> 57:06.648
Come on, come on! Don't stop,
get moving. Get moving.

57:06.749 --> 57:08.650
For this side, fellow African.

57:08.751 --> 57:10.277
Chinese people, this side.

57:10.378 --> 57:13.155
She married me,
so she's is one of us.

57:13.256 --> 57:14.499
Move, move.

57:15.174 --> 57:16.375
You...

57:19.187 --> 57:21.079
Fine, stay there. There's perfect.

57:21.180 --> 57:24.249
Come on! Come on!
Guys, guys please, please move.

57:24.350 --> 57:26.627
Stand that side, please.

57:26.728 --> 57:29.513
Please, African friends.

57:29.814 --> 57:31.182
Trust me.

57:37.155 --> 57:39.807
Come on, hurry up, get moving.
You want to be on this side?

57:39.908 --> 57:41.433
- Get out.
- Fuck off, bro!

57:41.534 --> 57:42.827
What's up?

57:43.745 --> 57:44.854
Why?

58:06.609 --> 58:09.044
Give a line down the middle.

58:09.145 --> 58:11.755
I want to see a clear boundary line.

58:11.856 --> 58:14.668
Show me the line, please.

58:20.073 --> 58:22.224
I brought the helicopter.

58:23.034 --> 58:24.994
I call the shots.

58:25.311 --> 58:27.463
Everyone leaves tomorrow.

58:27.664 --> 58:29.574
Children and women leave with the chopper.

58:29.707 --> 58:32.076
The men will follow me on foot.

58:37.298 --> 58:38.833
Everybody.

58:40.802 --> 58:43.145
We leave together.

59:11.541 --> 59:14.359
Old timer, the defensive
formation out front...

59:14.460 --> 59:16.028
That was you, right?

59:16.379 --> 59:18.255
You're not bad yourself.

59:26.305 --> 59:29.399
Former people's liberation army of China,
14th corps, south-west region...

59:29.500 --> 59:32.036
Recon company commander, he jian guo.

59:32.137 --> 59:35.105
Former people's liberation army,
special ops brigade, south-east region...

59:35.206 --> 59:36.840
Wolf warrior squadron, leng feng.

59:36.941 --> 59:38.209
At your service.

59:41.446 --> 59:42.913
Drink in your honor.

59:55.793 --> 59:59.488
An hour ago, these people
didn't know if they'd live to see tomorrow.

59:59.589 --> 01:00:02.282
- Why are they so happy?
- Our African friends...

01:00:02.383 --> 01:00:05.410
It doesn't matter if it's war,
disease or poverty...

01:00:05.511 --> 01:00:08.839
Once they're around the bonfire,
all their cares go away.

01:00:10.516 --> 01:00:11.668
Africa.

01:00:12.101 --> 01:00:13.636
Great food.

01:00:14.145 --> 01:00:16.055
Nice scenery.

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:18.766
Hot women.

01:00:53.726 --> 01:00:54.785
Hey.

01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:57.930
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:01:02.443 --> 01:01:05.387
I don't want to ride
my father's coat tail all my life.

01:01:05.488 --> 01:01:07.273
I love this place!

01:01:08.241 --> 01:01:11.319
Lions, crocodiles,
ak-47s, sniper rifles...

01:01:11.661 --> 01:01:15.156
And the melody of gunfire you can't get
in a peaceful country.

01:01:17.917 --> 01:01:20.703
That's the most wonderful
sound in the world.

01:01:20.837 --> 01:01:23.664
Do you want to know why pasha
bit you today?

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:27.918
Because her father was killed
ak-47s you so adore.

01:01:31.472 --> 01:01:33.424
If this were you...

01:01:35.001 --> 01:01:37.586
Would you still think it's wonderful?

01:01:59.658 --> 01:02:01.769
Oh man, look at this.

01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:03.605
That's a big party.

01:02:14.891 --> 01:02:16.541
I love these things.

01:02:16.642 --> 01:02:17.802
Look at them.

01:02:47.548 --> 01:02:48.566
Fuck!

01:02:49.467 --> 01:02:50.543
Pasha!

01:02:56.515 --> 01:02:57.525
Pasha!

01:03:15.284 --> 01:03:16.310
Shit!

01:03:29.924 --> 01:03:31.192
Let me go!

01:03:32.093 --> 01:03:35.146
Take out the veteran.
Athena, take out the old man.

01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:41.494
Stay here!

01:03:46.857 --> 01:03:48.259
Let her go!

01:04:18.931 --> 01:04:19.957
Pasha!

01:04:23.311 --> 01:04:25.763
Like ants when you lift a rock.

01:04:32.278 --> 01:04:33.295
Fuck!

01:04:52.798 --> 01:04:53.942
Help me!

01:04:55.051 --> 01:04:57.295
They got my leg!

01:04:58.054 --> 01:04:59.922
You're fine.

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:08.997
Shit!

01:05:09.398 --> 01:05:10.725
Go!

01:05:13.527 --> 01:05:14.929
Go! Go!

01:06:11.794 --> 01:06:13.479
I need a reload!

01:06:15.631 --> 01:06:16.682
Go!

01:06:27.893 --> 01:06:29.762
What are you doing, man?

01:06:35.526 --> 01:06:36.530
Fuck!

01:06:46.579 --> 01:06:47.746
Let's split up!

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:53.568
Go! Go!

01:06:53.669 --> 01:06:54.712
Go!

01:06:59.508 --> 01:07:00.518
Damn it.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:05.697
Come on!

01:07:06.098 --> 01:07:07.666
- Let's go!
- Come on!

01:07:28.454 --> 01:07:29.572
Pasha.

01:07:32.166 --> 01:07:33.951
Pasha, where are you?

01:07:40.916 --> 01:07:43.377
Move out of the way, bitch!

01:07:50.809 --> 01:07:51.986
Run!

01:08:58.961 --> 01:09:00.944
We know you're not a soldier anymore.

01:09:01.046 --> 01:09:03.247
What the fuck are you fighting for?

01:09:07.569 --> 01:09:09.546
Once a wolf warrior...

01:09:10.139 --> 01:09:12.381
Always a wolf warrior!

01:09:32.010 --> 01:09:33.645
Bear, you're on point.

01:09:33.746 --> 01:09:35.395
Athena, cover the exit.

01:09:35.497 --> 01:09:37.741
I want this son of a bitch.

01:10:15.829 --> 01:10:18.932
<i>Team Charlie, spotted target.
We are in pursuit.</i>

01:10:19.541 --> 01:10:22.770
<i>Sir, team bravo has target 12 o'clock.</i>

01:11:16.682 --> 01:11:17.707
What the fuck?

01:11:17.808 --> 01:11:20.494
Those idiots want us to retreat now?

01:11:35.284 --> 01:11:37.602
<i>This is general actu.</i>

01:11:37.703 --> 01:11:39.854
<i>Everyone return to base.</i>

01:11:39.955 --> 01:11:42.074
<i>Return to base.</i>

01:11:44.668 --> 01:11:49.414
<i>Big daddy, I'm ordering you to get
the fuck back here now!</i>

01:12:06.106 --> 01:12:07.840
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

01:12:07.941 --> 01:12:13.146
I told you so many fucking times
that we cannot kill the Chinese!

01:12:13.447 --> 01:12:17.350
China is a permanent member
of the UN security council.

01:12:17.451 --> 01:12:20.853
And I need them on my side
if I am to take political power.

01:12:20.954 --> 01:12:23.532
You fucking asshole!

01:12:30.255 --> 01:12:31.489
Kill leng...

01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:32.949
And find pasha...

01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:35.710
And you'll be the king
of this fucking country.

01:12:37.471 --> 01:12:40.047
As you comment, sir!

01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:49.374
Hold it!

01:12:49.691 --> 01:12:50.943
Leng feng!

01:12:54.404 --> 01:12:55.889
Who are you?

01:13:00.294 --> 01:13:02.311
We just fought a battle together,
what's your deal?

01:13:02.412 --> 01:13:05.982
Brother fan, we were pretty safe
before he got here.

01:13:06.083 --> 01:13:09.444
Ever wonder why the rebels show up
after he got here?

01:13:09.545 --> 01:13:11.320
He's a friend of my son.

01:13:11.421 --> 01:13:13.498
He came here for me.

01:13:13.632 --> 01:13:15.366
Have you met him before?

01:13:15.467 --> 01:13:17.410
My son always talks about him.

01:13:17.511 --> 01:13:18.662
So?

01:13:19.888 --> 01:13:21.164
I trust him!

01:13:21.265 --> 01:13:23.875
He rescued pasha and me
earlier today at the hospital.

01:13:23.976 --> 01:13:26.002
He's been protecting us ever since.

01:13:26.103 --> 01:13:27.795
Let me get this straight.

01:13:27.896 --> 01:13:31.048
You met him the same time
your doctor friend died?

01:13:31.149 --> 01:13:35.562
People are getting killed around him,
while he's unscathed.

01:13:36.029 --> 01:13:37.163
Friend...

01:13:37.364 --> 01:13:39.174
Speak for yourself.

01:13:39.992 --> 01:13:41.293
Get off me!

01:13:54.339 --> 01:13:55.615
Lamanla.

01:13:55.716 --> 01:13:57.134
Lamanla?

01:13:57.718 --> 01:13:59.211
He has lamanla!

01:14:02.472 --> 01:14:03.477
Lin!

01:14:04.057 --> 01:14:05.550
He's my friend.

01:14:07.978 --> 01:14:09.746
He just saved my life.

01:14:10.981 --> 01:14:13.016
Then he... what about them?

01:14:13.692 --> 01:14:15.176
What about them?

01:14:15.277 --> 01:14:17.553
Last month, the comms center10 km away...

01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:18.971
One person got lamanla.

01:14:19.072 --> 01:14:21.724
In the end, the whole place was wiped out.

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:24.152
Everyone's life is at stake here.

01:14:24.536 --> 01:14:27.363
Look, it is not just my opinion.

01:14:27.664 --> 01:14:29.574
Ask them yourself.

01:14:41.887 --> 01:14:43.047
I'll leave.

01:14:47.893 --> 01:14:48.927
Wait.

01:14:51.538 --> 01:14:55.717
You all know what will happen to someone
infected with lamanla.

01:14:56.985 --> 01:14:59.437
I hope you'll always remember...

01:14:59.738 --> 01:15:03.066
This dying man saved all of you.

01:15:03.450 --> 01:15:04.934
Shame on you!

01:15:05.035 --> 01:15:07.037
Shame on all of you!

01:15:59.047 --> 01:16:00.215
Leng feng!

01:16:00.632 --> 01:16:01.657
Leng feng!

01:16:01.758 --> 01:16:02.809
Leng feng!

01:16:03.010 --> 01:16:04.111
Leng feng!

01:16:36.351 --> 01:16:37.960
<i>How confident are you with a gun?</i>

01:16:38.061 --> 01:16:39.487
<i>So-50%.</i>

01:16:39.588 --> 01:16:41.873
<i>There's no place in my team for so-50%.</i>

01:16:43.592 --> 01:16:45.826
<i>Trying to get me drunk
so I blurt out the truth?</i>

01:16:45.927 --> 01:16:47.370
<i>Will you blurt out the truth?</i>

01:16:47.471 --> 01:16:48.630
<i>Certainly.</i>

01:16:53.727 --> 01:16:55.461
<i>What are you like when you're drunk?</i>

01:16:55.562 --> 01:16:57.930
<i>I'll let you buy me drinks
when you come back.</i>

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.188
You're the one who didn't come back.

01:17:09.743 --> 01:17:11.394
<i>Come back to bed.</i>

01:17:11.495 --> 01:17:12.821
<i>Cut it out.</i>

01:17:22.464 --> 01:17:24.240
<i>When I get back...</i>

01:17:24.341 --> 01:17:26.668
<i>This had better be signed.</i>

01:17:40.982 --> 01:17:43.268
<i>It's an easy death
when you're on the attack.</i>

01:17:44.319 --> 01:17:47.856
<i>But it's a hard life carrying
a survivor's guilt.</i>

01:17:56.706 --> 01:17:58.908
<i>But you didn't come back.</i>

01:17:59.417 --> 01:18:01.119
It's you who didn't come back.

01:18:02.587 --> 01:18:04.414
You didn't come back.

01:18:22.274 --> 01:18:23.792
Against who?

01:18:24.693 --> 01:18:27.270
Who were we fighting yesterday?

01:18:39.266 --> 01:18:43.920
Didn't your mom tell you that
you shouldn't play with a gun?

01:18:47.591 --> 01:18:48.684
Leng!

01:18:50.427 --> 01:18:51.786
That was leng...

01:18:51.887 --> 01:18:53.697
Only him alone.

01:18:55.015 --> 01:18:56.383
It was me!

01:18:58.268 --> 01:19:01.679
I was in the military before I worked here.

01:19:02.105 --> 01:19:05.934
Does anyone here
look like they can shoot?

01:19:06.234 --> 01:19:07.560
Okay.

01:19:29.507 --> 01:19:31.067
You're up.

01:19:34.804 --> 01:19:37.456
It's a shame Dr. Chen
didn't live to see this.

01:19:37.557 --> 01:19:40.885
He discovered the presence of self-healing
properties in humans.

01:19:41.061 --> 01:19:43.087
In extreme rare cases...

01:19:43.188 --> 01:19:45.297
Lamanla antibodies
can be found in patients.

01:19:45.398 --> 01:19:48.425
Among the thousands
of lamanla patients he treated.

01:19:48.526 --> 01:19:51.354
He chanced upon one such person.

01:19:51.863 --> 01:19:54.149
And that person is pasha.

01:19:54.699 --> 01:19:57.852
So pasha's not his daughter,
but his patient.

01:19:57.953 --> 01:20:01.397
From the analysis of pasha's blood...

01:20:01.498 --> 01:20:03.983
He created an experimental vaccine.

01:20:04.167 --> 01:20:06.026
Last night was a dire situation...

01:20:06.127 --> 01:20:09.238
So I experimented on you,
what Dr. Chen was planning to do.

01:20:09.339 --> 01:20:11.991
The first human trial
that he was hoping for.

01:20:12.092 --> 01:20:15.170
Injecting you with Dr. Chen's newly
synthesized vaccine immunogens.

01:20:15.845 --> 01:20:17.246
Honestly speaking...

01:20:17.347 --> 01:20:20.216
I didn't know what would happen.

01:20:22.477 --> 01:20:23.862
Luckily.

01:20:24.521 --> 01:20:26.848
God was on your side.

01:20:33.905 --> 01:20:38.726
<i>The population has lost faith in the
government to contain the outbreak.</i>

01:20:38.827 --> 01:20:40.769
<i>So, whoever takes pasha...</i>

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:43.022
<i>Takes the country easily.</i>

01:20:43.123 --> 01:20:45.700
<i>That explains why the rebel army
is hot on our heels.</i>

01:21:07.522 --> 01:21:10.725
<i>My dad said man walked out of Africa
100.000 years ago.</i>

01:21:10.859 --> 01:21:13.719
<i>Africa is the cradle of
modern civilization.</i>

01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:16.388
Yet when the "evolved, civilized"
humans returned to this land,

01:21:16.489 --> 01:21:18.632
they brought along with them
nothing but suffering,

01:21:18.733 --> 01:21:21.736
slavery, disease and war.

01:21:21.995 --> 01:21:23.020
Koreans...

01:21:23.121 --> 01:21:24.438
Icelanders...

01:21:24.539 --> 01:21:25.773
Slavs...

01:21:25.874 --> 01:21:27.200
Americans...

01:21:27.417 --> 01:21:29.068
And over there are Chinese.

01:21:29.169 --> 01:21:33.248
People from all over the world,
people like my father.

01:21:34.065 --> 01:21:35.708
For Africa...

01:21:36.009 --> 01:21:38.419
They gave their best years.

01:21:39.012 --> 01:21:40.496
In the end...

01:21:40.597 --> 01:21:43.341
They got to remain here for eternity.

01:21:54.611 --> 01:21:56.363
What's her name?

01:21:56.696 --> 01:21:57.747
Huh?

01:21:58.823 --> 01:22:00.992
The person you can't seem to forget.

01:22:04.913 --> 01:22:06.406
Long xiao yun.

01:22:10.085 --> 01:22:11.619
She's lucky...

01:22:12.654 --> 01:22:15.272
To have a man that loves her so much.

01:22:16.049 --> 01:22:18.167
Why didn't she come back?

01:22:28.353 --> 01:22:29.546
Sorry.

01:22:49.332 --> 01:22:52.735
I want you to round 'em up like cattle.
Make 'em feel safe. You understand me?

01:22:52.836 --> 01:22:53.870
Yes, sir.

01:23:04.973 --> 01:23:07.842
We got mountains to the west,
we got forests to the east.

01:23:08.026 --> 01:23:10.192
The only smart place for
them to come is right here...

01:23:10.267 --> 01:23:11.870
And wait for the
rescue helicopter.

01:23:11.971 --> 01:23:14.407
I sure hope these Chinese people don't die.

01:23:14.649 --> 01:23:17.018
I'm about the only thing
that can save them right now.

01:23:22.323 --> 01:23:23.900
Round 'em up.

01:23:24.367 --> 01:23:27.320
Everybody, let's go! Let's go!
Move, move, move!

01:23:42.594 --> 01:23:44.712
Wait till I get out of here...

01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:47.840
I'm going to settle the score with them.

01:23:48.183 --> 01:23:49.583
Brother fan...

01:23:49.684 --> 01:23:52.136
Cut the fucking bullshit.

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:54.639
How are we going to get out?

01:23:55.648 --> 01:23:56.882
And besides...

01:23:56.983 --> 01:23:58.768
What are you planning to do?

01:23:58.902 --> 01:24:00.928
What can you even do?

01:24:01.029 --> 01:24:02.313
Brother fan...

01:24:02.931 --> 01:24:05.199
In normal times,
everyone gives in to you.

01:24:05.575 --> 01:24:07.276
In battle...

01:24:07.494 --> 01:24:09.654
No one will be giving in to us.

01:24:09.954 --> 01:24:11.739
Shut the fuck up!

01:25:23.778 --> 01:25:25.238
Go to hell!

01:25:44.591 --> 01:25:47.326
Brother, how are you holding up?

01:25:47.427 --> 01:25:49.086
Not as well as back in the day.

01:25:52.932 --> 01:25:56.511
Your hands are for saving lives
not taking lives.

01:26:14.162 --> 01:26:16.747
How would wolf warriors fight this battle?

01:27:00.875 --> 01:27:01.876
Go!

01:27:05.838 --> 01:27:06.839
Go!

01:28:27.545 --> 01:28:31.357
Didn't your mom tell you
not to play with weap...?

01:28:37.246 --> 01:28:39.681
Didn't your mom tell you
not to fuck with spoiled brats?

01:28:39.782 --> 01:28:40.867
Let's go!

01:29:05.166 --> 01:29:07.926
Here's evidence of the rebel army
killing our citizens.

01:29:08.027 --> 01:29:10.604
Transmission received.
<i>We will gather up all the information...</i>

01:29:10.705 --> 01:29:13.173
<i>And have ambassador fan
submit it to the UN.</i>

01:29:13.608 --> 01:29:15.325
- Copy that.
- Oh and one more thing.

01:29:15.426 --> 01:29:19.121
<i>The local government has critically
requested for our military assistance.</i>

01:29:19.222 --> 01:29:21.415
<i>The chopper will arrive shortly.</i>

01:29:21.516 --> 01:29:23.551
- We're waiting for you.
<i>- Copy that!</i>

01:29:39.534 --> 01:29:41.059
Get on the chopper.

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:43.446
There're a lot of people here
who still need me.

01:29:45.081 --> 01:29:46.190
Lin zhi xiong!

01:29:48.192 --> 01:29:50.052
Women and children must get on the chopper.

01:29:50.153 --> 01:29:52.429
Right now I'm not a woman. I'm a doctor.

01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:54.989
The more professional than you
when it comes to saving lives.

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:57.684
But I'm more professional than you
in protecting lives!

01:29:57.793 --> 01:30:00.329
Pasha, are you ready
to get on the helicopter?

01:30:00.546 --> 01:30:02.665
Can you pass me some gauze please?

01:30:04.825 --> 01:30:06.569
Get on the helicopter.

01:30:07.645 --> 01:30:09.713
Don't be difficult, okay?

01:30:09.814 --> 01:30:10.982
Excuse me?

01:30:11.566 --> 01:30:13.267
Excuse you my ass!

01:30:48.728 --> 01:30:50.263
Whoa, what was that?

01:30:52.565 --> 01:30:54.174
Mayday! Mayday!

01:30:54.275 --> 01:30:56.426
Missile strike! Tail rotor lost!

01:30:56.527 --> 01:30:58.470
I have control. Going down!

01:30:58.571 --> 01:31:00.473
Mayday! Mayday!

01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.527
Brace! Brace!

01:31:41.364 --> 01:31:42.447
Go!

01:31:42.548 --> 01:31:43.699
Go!

01:31:44.909 --> 01:31:46.043
Run!

01:32:02.802 --> 01:32:04.027
To the bunker!

01:32:04.428 --> 01:32:05.471
Hurry!

01:32:11.102 --> 01:32:12.312
Rachel!

01:32:15.356 --> 01:32:16.591
Wake up!

01:32:21.237 --> 01:32:22.305
Come on!

01:32:39.422 --> 01:32:40.497
Rachel!

01:32:52.101 --> 01:32:53.653
Go find Lao he!

01:33:22.548 --> 01:33:24.275
Get up! Come on!

01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:31.892
Fuck!

01:33:33.684 --> 01:33:35.469
Get to the bunker!

01:33:59.251 --> 01:34:01.403
Go! Quickly! Go!

01:34:01.504 --> 01:34:03.205
Go! Quickly!

01:34:22.525 --> 01:34:24.010
Get ready!

01:34:36.038 --> 01:34:37.440
Fire!

01:34:38.791 --> 01:34:40.543
Kill that motherfucker!

01:34:42.670 --> 01:34:43.938
Reload!

01:34:49.593 --> 01:34:51.186
I can't aim.

01:34:51.387 --> 01:34:53.121
This thing's so heavy!

01:34:53.222 --> 01:34:54.622
You wanna die!?

01:34:54.723 --> 01:34:57.259
Trigger that fuse and it'll kill us all!

01:35:12.324 --> 01:35:14.201
Fire!

01:35:58.829 --> 01:36:00.147
Oh, check it.

01:36:03.167 --> 01:36:04.619
Three clicks down.

01:36:14.094 --> 01:36:15.346
- Fire!
- Fire!

01:36:58.305 --> 01:37:00.382
They found the bunker!

01:37:03.519 --> 01:37:04.752
I got it! I got it!

01:37:04.853 --> 01:37:06.488
- To the left.
- Copy that.

01:37:06.689 --> 01:37:07.689
Reload!

01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:09.466
We're out!

01:37:19.952 --> 01:37:21.320
Hang on!

01:37:28.002 --> 01:37:29.028
Fire!

01:38:25.351 --> 01:38:26.727
Son of a bitch!

01:38:47.956 --> 01:38:49.758
Fuck! Move this fucking thing.

01:39:05.265 --> 01:39:07.076
Come on! Come on!

01:39:10.479 --> 01:39:11.505
Good, good, good.

01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:44.725
Fuck!

01:39:48.308 --> 01:39:51.336
I guess the Chinese military
ain't as lame as I thought.

01:39:51.437 --> 01:39:52.838
Cut the crap.

01:39:59.903 --> 01:40:00.980
Go!

01:40:02.531 --> 01:40:03.535
Go!

01:40:29.391 --> 01:40:30.476
Hurry!

01:43:49.216 --> 01:43:51.535
Don't come out!

01:43:56.139 --> 01:43:58.717
Track the signals and
verify targets positions!

01:44:24.668 --> 01:44:26.777
Godfather!

01:44:26.878 --> 01:44:28.330
Mom!

01:44:28.463 --> 01:44:29.932
Mom!

01:45:16.995 --> 01:45:18.996
Sir, we have triangulated
on the phone's position!

01:45:19.097 --> 01:45:20.824
Sir, targets locked on!

01:45:56.259 --> 01:45:59.663
- Sir, we received orders from command!
- Fire!

01:48:13.939 --> 01:48:15.498
Now it's personal.

01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:22.372
Long xiao yun.

01:48:29.079 --> 01:48:30.864
Is that your girl?

01:48:32.624 --> 01:48:34.133
She's pretty.

01:48:34.334 --> 01:48:37.112
Blood... for blood.

01:50:32.202 --> 01:50:34.354
<i>Please don't fight!</i>

01:50:38.625 --> 01:50:40.085
Look at them.

01:50:42.770 --> 01:50:45.423
You're gonna die for this people.

01:50:51.846 --> 01:50:54.416
I was born for them.

01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:02.047
People like you will always be inferior
to people like me.

01:51:02.148 --> 01:51:03.465
Get used to it.

01:51:03.566 --> 01:51:05.518
Get fucking used to it.

01:51:43.815 --> 01:51:45.859
That's fucking history.

01:52:26.774 --> 01:52:28.167
Welcome back.

01:53:25.375 --> 01:53:29.003
The war zone is up ahead.
We can't get through.

01:53:53.987 --> 01:53:57.073
Unidentified vehicle convoy
at three o'clock.

01:54:06.541 --> 01:54:07.608
Brother...

01:54:08.418 --> 01:54:10.036
Pass me the flag.

01:54:38.448 --> 01:54:39.724
Drive.

01:55:00.345 --> 01:55:01.787
It's the Chinese.

01:55:01.888 --> 01:55:03.189
Hold your fire.

01:55:05.224 --> 01:55:06.708
Hold your fire!

01:55:06.809 --> 01:55:08.169
It's Chinese.

01:56:36.748 --> 01:56:44.748

01:56:44.772 --> 01:56:52.772

01:57:55.061 --> 01:57:56.087
<i>Leng feng.</i>

01:58:00.107 --> 01:58:02.835
- Commander!
<i>- I see you're enjoying your life.</i>

01:58:03.010 --> 01:58:04.878
<i>Not planning on rejoining
the wolf warriors?</i>

01:58:04.979 --> 01:58:08.223
Sir, the earliest flight out of here,
departs next Tuesday at 14:15...

01:58:08.324 --> 01:58:09.474
By Friday 09:00.

01:58:09.575 --> 01:58:11.444
I will report for duty sir!

01:58:12.370 --> 01:58:14.447
<i>There's something I need to tell you...</i>
