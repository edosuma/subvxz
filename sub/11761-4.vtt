00:01.636 --> 00:03.626
<i>Previously on Camelot...</i>

00:03.628 --> 00:05.836
If we recruit an exceptional
warrior would boost our morale.

00:05.904 --> 00:07.705
- Anyone spring to mind?
- Gawain.

00:09.746 --> 00:13.757
Your king requires your service,
and he demands your loyalty.

00:13.824 --> 00:16.294
There was something
between us. At the coronation.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.534
If you don't feel the same way,
then why did you come?

00:18.602 --> 00:22.241
Just once. Just once.

00:22.309 --> 00:26.151
I know my arrival was difficult for you.
But I'm glad

00:26.219 --> 00:28.355
we could get to know each other.
What do you hope for?

00:28.423 --> 00:31.259
What's in there?
Did I hurt you?

00:31.327 --> 00:33.564
May these rings stand
forever

00:33.632 --> 00:37.539
as a symbol of your unity
and fidelity.

00:39.577 --> 00:42.513
This... power
you've learned.

00:42.581 --> 00:44.450
It costs.

00:44.517 --> 00:47.922
- Don't try and frighten me, Merlin.
- The price will be too high.

00:47.989 --> 00:52.063
No, not too high
at all.

03:29.276 --> 03:30.744
Arthur.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.247
I want every warrior
out of his bed.

03:33.314 --> 03:36.017
Tell Gawain he starts
training everyone. Right away.

03:36.084 --> 03:37.985
Of course.

03:55.506 --> 03:58.675
Good morning... Wife.

03:58.743 --> 04:02.479
Morning, Husband.

04:02.547 --> 04:06.317
Were you watching me sleep?
Yes.

04:06.385 --> 04:09.320
- You are so strange.
- I'm lucky.

04:09.388 --> 04:12.123
I'm the only man who ever gets
to see you like this.

04:21.166 --> 04:23.767
You're a good man.

04:23.835 --> 04:26.236
So...

04:26.304 --> 04:29.906
So when
can we leave Camelot?

04:29.974 --> 04:32.409
I don't think
it's going to be that simple.

04:32.476 --> 04:34.111
Leontes,

04:34.178 --> 04:36.814
you promised after the wedding
you would talk to the king

04:36.881 --> 04:39.516
about getting some land and
a place for us to live together.

04:39.584 --> 04:41.484
Yes, I know, but--

04:41.552 --> 04:45.888
Leontes, put her down!
The king wants all his warriors now!

04:45.956 --> 04:47.523
I understand.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.892
And in time we will.

04:55.466 --> 04:57.733
But right now
the king needs his champion--

04:57.800 --> 04:59.968
here.

05:00.036 --> 05:03.104
You understand that,
don't you?

05:20.492 --> 05:23.161
Breakfast.

05:25.097 --> 05:28.566
Why don't you go down,
eat with him?

05:30.970 --> 05:33.838
I'm waiting
to be invited.

06:05.871 --> 06:08.138
Perhaps
a little guidance is needed.

06:22.654 --> 06:25.089
Did you send word
to Camelot to expect us?

06:25.156 --> 06:27.856
Both done as you asked.
And this is the gift.

06:28.781 --> 06:29.781
The gift!

06:29.862 --> 06:31.897
Perfect for a new bride.

06:31.964 --> 06:34.833
Very good.
Very good.

06:34.901 --> 06:38.804
If you don't mind me asking,
why are we paying such attention

06:38.872 --> 06:41.007
to the bride of the king's
champion?

06:41.075 --> 06:43.543
As the king's sister,

06:43.611 --> 06:46.547
I should welcome every
new arrival into Camelot.

06:46.614 --> 06:52.119
Especially the women. We can
give each other strength and--

06:52.187 --> 06:54.154
Are you all right?

06:54.221 --> 06:56.223
I'm fine.

07:00.695 --> 07:03.062
Let me help.

07:03.130 --> 07:05.231
I said I'm fine.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.300
Now,

07:07.368 --> 07:09.569
is my horse ready or not?

07:09.637 --> 07:12.072
You were complaining
of pains yesterday.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.074
Are you sure
you're well enough to ride?

07:14.141 --> 07:16.776
Are you a doctor,
or a servant?

07:16.844 --> 07:19.679
I'll ensure
everything's ready.

07:32.558 --> 07:35.694
- This is it?
- Yes.

07:35.762 --> 07:39.532
- I thought there'd be an army.
- Hah!

07:39.599 --> 07:43.237
The king's forces are this few?
Really?

07:43.304 --> 07:46.073
We're recruiting.

07:46.141 --> 07:49.943
- So what are we fighting for?
- How do you mean?

07:50.011 --> 07:53.380
The way we fight, the way I train you all,
depends on what we're fighting for.

07:53.447 --> 07:55.648
- We're fighting for freedom.
- Whose?

07:55.716 --> 07:57.717
- Everyone's.
- Not mine.

07:57.784 --> 08:00.853
I'm free already. I can do what I want.
Well, then why are you here?

08:00.920 --> 08:03.888
They told me
you were worth following.

08:07.159 --> 08:09.560
Then we're fighting
for the people,

08:09.628 --> 08:14.232
for their freedom from chaos.
Give him a chance.

08:16.201 --> 08:18.402
All right.

08:18.470 --> 08:21.772
Forget the talk.
Show me how you fight.

08:21.840 --> 08:25.009
Maybe I can make them
in your image.

08:27.012 --> 08:28.679
I'm ready.

09:15.092 --> 09:18.361
I'm not sure
you are ready, Your Highness.

09:18.429 --> 09:21.998
All right.

09:22.065 --> 09:25.868
Sparta. The perfect training ground.
Those bastards were good for something.

09:25.935 --> 09:29.138
- Well, then you are the man to train us.
- I'm glad that you agree.

09:29.205 --> 09:32.006
Looks like
you need a new sword.

09:32.074 --> 09:35.643
Yes,
one suitable for a king.

09:35.711 --> 09:38.012
Do you know Caliburn?

09:38.080 --> 09:40.047
Best bladesmith
I ever met.

09:40.115 --> 09:42.416
He'll make you something
special.

09:42.484 --> 09:44.418
Where will I find him?

09:44.486 --> 09:46.620
He's been holed up in the
woods since his wife died.

09:46.688 --> 09:50.058
You'll need to be careful;
he's volatile.

09:50.125 --> 09:53.061
I don't mind volatile.

09:53.129 --> 09:55.664
You give me directions,
I'll find him.

09:55.731 --> 09:58.567
Before I do, a word.

10:01.305 --> 10:05.075
It stops now. Whatever you feel for
her, destroy it. It has no future.

10:05.142 --> 10:07.778
- You don't control my future.
- Last warning.

10:07.846 --> 10:11.883
Don't unsettle our project
with misdirected desire.

10:11.950 --> 10:15.052
Train hard.
I'll return with a sword.

10:18.623 --> 10:21.924
I trust your wedding night was
all you hoped for.

10:21.992 --> 10:26.962
And I trust you'd understand if
I'd prefer to keep it private.

10:27.030 --> 10:28.464
Absolutely.

10:28.531 --> 10:30.399
Discretion in all things.

10:30.466 --> 10:33.268
But now that you are married,

10:33.336 --> 10:35.971
of course, you'll be coveted
more than ever.

10:37.874 --> 10:39.742
What do you mean?

10:39.809 --> 10:43.245
Well, the most enticing aspect
for any man is the forbidden.

10:43.313 --> 10:46.615
But you'll just have to forego the looks
from men other than your husband.

10:46.683 --> 10:49.518
For to pay them any heed is
really...

10:49.585 --> 10:53.188
Well, it's the worst thing
that any woman could do.

10:53.256 --> 10:56.858
I've known women's lives
come undone that way.

10:59.662 --> 11:01.596
Here, let me help you.

11:15.278 --> 11:17.212
Stop!

11:20.784 --> 11:22.684
We should rest a moment.

11:22.752 --> 11:24.820
I'll take some water.

11:42.539 --> 11:46.708
You're sick.

11:46.776 --> 11:52.547
I need to go to Camelot.
I have to see this girl.

11:52.614 --> 11:56.584
You're not well enough.
I'm taking you back.

11:56.652 --> 11:58.586
No!

11:58.654 --> 12:02.623
With respect,
your well-being is my priority.

12:02.691 --> 12:05.459
You need to rest.

12:07.396 --> 12:09.964
Let us take care
of you.

12:33.055 --> 12:36.190
- Hello.
- Your Highness.

12:36.258 --> 12:40.894
- You know you don't have to do that.
- I think I do.

12:44.298 --> 12:47.567
What happens now?
Between us?

12:47.635 --> 12:50.170
Nothing.

12:50.238 --> 12:53.541
I committed myself.

12:53.608 --> 12:55.543
You blessed the rings.

12:55.610 --> 12:58.213
I didn't sleep...

12:58.280 --> 12:59.881
...the whole night.

12:59.949 --> 13:02.451
I thought
about what he was doing.

13:02.519 --> 13:05.554
- Arthur, stop this.
- Is he good? Is he better than me?

13:05.622 --> 13:08.123
- This isn't appropriate.
- I want to know.

13:08.191 --> 13:12.061
It has nothing to do
with you!

13:12.128 --> 13:15.064
On the beach.

13:15.132 --> 13:17.633
It meant something.

13:17.701 --> 13:19.735
No.

13:19.803 --> 13:23.172
It didn't.

13:25.609 --> 13:29.878
If it had, do you think
I could've married him?

13:29.946 --> 13:33.583
What sort of person would that
have made me?

13:33.651 --> 13:35.986
You gave yourself to me.

13:36.054 --> 13:39.590
Whoever that person was,

13:39.657 --> 13:43.193
she's gone;

13:43.261 --> 13:44.729
she's dead.

13:44.796 --> 13:48.665
- Who does that make you?
- Your champion's wife.

13:48.733 --> 13:52.369
Honoured to serve you.

13:54.740 --> 13:57.775
Well, may it bring you
much happiness.

14:43.788 --> 14:46.856
We're home.
You can rest now.

14:51.596 --> 14:53.430
No.

14:53.497 --> 14:55.932
Get her out!
The nun?

14:56.000 --> 14:59.902
How did she get in?
Who let her in?

14:59.970 --> 15:03.606
Get her out of here! Now!

15:05.476 --> 15:08.478
Now.
What have you done?

15:08.546 --> 15:10.613
Get her out!

15:26.799 --> 15:29.334
I don't want her
within sight of this castle.

15:29.401 --> 15:32.537
- I'll have the guards see to it.
- No, don't have them see to it!

15:32.605 --> 15:35.808
You see to it!
Make sure it's happened.

15:35.875 --> 15:38.277
Of course.

15:41.147 --> 15:43.215
Who is she?

15:45.318 --> 15:48.387
They need
to build up this fire!

15:48.455 --> 15:50.690
It's barely
giving out any heat!

15:50.758 --> 15:53.159
You're cold.

15:53.227 --> 15:57.030
Some rest will help.
It's just a fever.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.935
Of course.

16:01.003 --> 16:03.938
Let us look after you.

16:04.006 --> 16:07.008
The girls will take you
to your chamber.

16:07.076 --> 16:10.044
That woman--
not within sight.

16:21.089 --> 16:24.357
The shield is
your greatest ally.

16:24.425 --> 16:27.093
Now, these all look
like fine shields.

16:28.997 --> 16:30.698
But they're lacking.

16:36.806 --> 16:39.141
You.

16:39.209 --> 16:41.010
Attack me.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.893
Kay!

16:57.918 --> 17:00.915
Line the edge of your
shield with a blade--a knife

17:00.998 --> 17:03.065
or the broken end of a sword.

17:03.133 --> 17:07.770
Your shield then becomes not just a mode
of defence, but a weapon in itself.

17:07.838 --> 17:10.138
You all right?

17:10.207 --> 17:14.911
- You're a dirty fighter, Gawain.
- This is combat, not cooking.

17:14.979 --> 17:19.147
I train by example. By injuring the
warriors you're supposed to be training?

17:19.215 --> 17:22.050
Steady now.
Don't get excited--

17:22.118 --> 17:25.054
especially now you don't have a sword.
I don't need a sword.

17:25.122 --> 17:29.059
But what I do need is
an honourable instructor--

17:29.127 --> 17:31.995
One other thing on shields:

17:32.063 --> 17:35.599
always keep a dagger strapped
to your shield for emergencies.

17:35.666 --> 17:37.034
Your dagger is a part of you.

17:37.101 --> 17:39.269
It should never leave your side.
Inscribe it,

17:39.337 --> 17:41.472
carve it,
make it your own,

17:41.539 --> 17:44.074
so wherever you are,
you'll never mistake it.

17:44.142 --> 17:48.412
Some other rules of combat:
remove your emotions;

17:48.480 --> 17:50.514
keep calm;

17:50.582 --> 17:54.251
attempt to draw your opponent
into battle using their anger.

17:54.319 --> 17:56.253
That way
they're easily frustrated.

17:56.321 --> 17:58.055
Take your blade
from his throat.

17:58.123 --> 18:00.056
I could still take you
and the king's head.

18:01.959 --> 18:04.995
- Let him go.
- It's just a bit of fun.

18:05.062 --> 18:08.165
- Have your fun away from my brother.
- You heard what he said,

18:08.233 --> 18:12.604
Gawain. Nobody threatens the king,
neither in training nor in jest.

18:23.217 --> 18:26.820
- Thank you.
- Pleasure, Your Highness.

18:26.888 --> 18:32.025
Your marshal and your champion
have got some guts.

18:32.093 --> 18:35.195
And you have some men
who'll stand up for you.

18:38.232 --> 18:39.833
Good.

18:57.020 --> 19:00.656
Vivian,
I need to eat.

19:00.724 --> 19:03.860
Bring me food.
Lots of food. I'm starving.

19:03.927 --> 19:05.828
Should you be up?

19:09.833 --> 19:12.167
You do look a lot better.

19:12.235 --> 19:14.269
Just a fever.

19:16.205 --> 19:19.874
Tomorrow we'll go to Camelot
to see this Guinevere.

19:34.456 --> 19:37.125
Morgan, I'm sorry.

19:37.192 --> 19:39.516
She's still outside.

19:39.541 --> 19:42.524
I tried to move her,
but she wouldn't go.

19:42.866 --> 19:44.533
Of course she wouldn't.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.903
Who is she?

19:46.970 --> 19:50.106
My father banished me
to a nunnery across the sea.

19:50.174 --> 19:55.744
She taught me.
Well, she's come a long way.

19:55.811 --> 19:57.579
You don't want to know why?

19:57.647 --> 20:01.282
Did she treat you badly?

20:04.852 --> 20:07.487
I don't think about that place
now. I left it behind.

20:07.555 --> 20:10.858
- So we ignore her.
- I need more bread!

20:13.528 --> 20:15.196
What's the matter?

20:15.264 --> 20:17.766
Your eyes...

20:22.105 --> 20:25.108
It's just a drop of blood.

20:25.175 --> 20:27.110
No, Morgan,

20:27.178 --> 20:28.979
it's not.

20:29.046 --> 20:32.149
There's blood
everywhere.

20:37.155 --> 20:39.189
What do I do?

21:30.412 --> 21:33.380
- Who are you?
- Gawain sent me.

21:33.448 --> 21:37.117
I've come for a sword.
A sword?

21:37.185 --> 21:39.153
For you?

21:39.221 --> 21:41.656
No.

21:41.723 --> 21:45.659
Then you'd better leave.

21:45.727 --> 21:49.129
Before I slit you
from arse-hole to cake-hole.

21:49.197 --> 21:52.266
The sword's for the king.

21:52.334 --> 21:55.903
The new king?

21:59.774 --> 22:03.611
You tell this king,

22:03.678 --> 22:06.814
if he wants one
of Caliburn's swords,

22:06.882 --> 22:10.150
he damn well better get it
for himself.

22:12.153 --> 22:16.189
I'm a master bladesmith,

22:16.257 --> 22:19.560
not some fucking village
forge worker.

22:19.628 --> 22:23.430
Every sword I make is made
to order--it's unique.

22:23.498 --> 22:26.199
To make him a sword,
I'd need to know his weight,

22:26.267 --> 22:30.070
his swing, how he fights,
what's in his blood.

22:30.138 --> 22:33.005
I can tell you everything
you need to know.

22:33.073 --> 22:37.643
- You're that close to him?
- Yes.

22:40.980 --> 22:43.948
Who are you?

22:44.016 --> 22:46.184
My name's Merlin.

22:46.251 --> 22:51.189
The new king sends a sorcerer
for a sword.

22:51.256 --> 22:54.525
You have a sorcerer's sense
of timing.

22:54.593 --> 22:57.061
Come inside.

22:57.128 --> 22:59.697
I'll show you
my magic.

23:06.806 --> 23:09.741
You and the rest
of your household,

23:09.809 --> 23:12.244
go to your rooms.
Lock the doors.

23:12.312 --> 23:16.081
- Why?
- Because I told you.

23:16.149 --> 23:18.717
You look terrible, girl.

23:23.556 --> 23:26.591
Are you deaf
or just stupid? Go!

23:26.659 --> 23:28.660
- If you need me to--
- She won't.

23:28.727 --> 23:31.129
It's all right.

23:34.901 --> 23:37.002
It's not all right,
is it?

23:37.069 --> 23:39.270
It's not all right
at all.

23:39.338 --> 23:41.706
Have you vomited?

23:43.676 --> 23:46.209
- Walk, then.
- What?

23:46.273 --> 23:50.509
Walk! You know
what walking is, don't you?

23:51.416 --> 23:54.318
Stand up, child!
I can't!

23:56.689 --> 23:59.424
The limbs are weakening.

24:04.964 --> 24:07.332
I didn't have them
a moment ago.

24:07.399 --> 24:10.001
Your body is under attack.

24:10.069 --> 24:12.304
Tell me honestly:

24:12.371 --> 24:16.007
since you left us,
have you performed a summoning?

24:16.075 --> 24:19.243
Did you ask for anything?

24:19.311 --> 24:20.844
Yes.

24:20.912 --> 24:23.814
Oh, my child.

24:23.881 --> 24:26.383
How could you be
so reckless?

24:26.451 --> 24:29.453
- What's happening to me?
- I told you

24:29.521 --> 24:30.955
a long time ago,

24:31.022 --> 24:33.657
your arrogance will be
your downfall.

24:33.725 --> 24:37.895
I have one thing left
to teach you.

24:37.962 --> 24:39.997
I don't need you!

24:40.064 --> 24:43.200
I have nothing left to learn!
You do.

24:43.268 --> 24:44.969
You must learn to die.

24:45.037 --> 24:47.471
No!!

24:58.315 --> 25:02.016
So he's tall
but he's not strong.

25:02.084 --> 25:05.453
And when he fights, he's
passionate but too impulsive.

25:05.521 --> 25:06.754
Yes.

25:06.822 --> 25:09.090
He needs
to be weighted down more.

25:09.158 --> 25:11.392
- You could be right.
- I know I'm right.

25:11.460 --> 25:14.395
I was a warrior myself.

25:14.463 --> 25:17.231
I gloried in blood.

25:17.299 --> 25:20.435
Word of my approach could
clear battlefields.

25:20.502 --> 25:22.771
These days,

25:22.838 --> 25:25.674
I build the weapons
instead of brandishing them.

25:29.678 --> 25:32.380
But some nights,
when the wind rages,

25:34.516 --> 25:37.652
I still get the smell of blood
in my nostrils.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.259
This one.

25:45.326 --> 25:47.761
It's special.

25:49.831 --> 25:53.901
I made it from an ingot of Damascene steel
found only on the Coromandel shores.

25:53.969 --> 26:00.108
The precise amount of carbon, and the
sword becomes almost indestructible.

26:00.176 --> 26:02.511
I never got
the balance right.

26:02.579 --> 26:05.681
Until now.

26:08.652 --> 26:11.554
The zenith of my craft.

26:11.621 --> 26:13.889
Everything in unity.

26:16.526 --> 26:20.095
A new sword
for a new king.

26:22.565 --> 26:24.599
Maybe.

26:33.077 --> 26:36.947
So...

26:37.015 --> 26:39.316
The king's sorcerer.

26:39.384 --> 26:41.719
When you use your powers,

26:41.787 --> 26:43.755
how does it feel?

26:43.823 --> 26:47.525
I don't remember.

26:47.593 --> 26:50.695
What, you don't use them
any more? Why not?

26:52.631 --> 26:55.233
When you did,
those heady days,

26:55.301 --> 26:58.203
what was it like?

27:05.311 --> 27:08.680
Like an extra emotion.

27:08.748 --> 27:11.182
Really?

27:11.250 --> 27:14.185
But if you have this gift,

27:14.253 --> 27:16.855
why not use it?
Why deny yourself?

27:22.294 --> 27:25.096
Unless you're scared.

27:27.266 --> 27:29.568
No, no.

27:29.636 --> 27:33.339
It's more than that.

27:33.406 --> 27:36.008
Because you enjoy it.

28:31.199 --> 28:34.101
What're you doing?

28:38.472 --> 28:39.905
How long have you been there?

28:39.973 --> 28:45.377
- What?
- What did you see?

28:45.445 --> 28:47.546
Take your knife
from my daughter.

28:49.482 --> 28:51.450
I thought
you lived alone.

28:51.518 --> 28:55.222
I brought food.
Is he going to eat with us?

28:55.289 --> 28:57.758
Not if he keeps threatening
my little girl.

28:57.826 --> 28:59.427
You know who this is?

28:59.494 --> 29:03.398
The famous sorcerer,
Merlin.

29:03.466 --> 29:05.501
Excalibur.

29:05.569 --> 29:07.102
Excalibur, Merlin.

29:07.170 --> 29:10.072
I'll make enough
for both of you.

29:13.310 --> 29:15.044
She's beautiful.

29:15.111 --> 29:17.513
Her mother died
giving birth to her.

29:19.482 --> 29:20.916
I'm sorry.

29:20.983 --> 29:22.884
You have family?

29:22.951 --> 29:24.986
Not any more.

29:25.054 --> 29:29.158
Just your king.

29:29.225 --> 29:31.126
Eat with us.

29:31.194 --> 29:33.663
Then we rest.

29:33.730 --> 29:36.666
And in the morning,

29:36.734 --> 29:39.770
you will have your sword
for your king.

29:44.076 --> 29:46.845
A warrior needs his sleep.

29:46.912 --> 29:50.582
A king even more so.
Can't manage it tonight.

29:50.649 --> 29:53.384
But I do have a question
for you.

29:53.452 --> 29:55.853
All right.

29:55.921 --> 29:59.057
About strategy.

29:59.124 --> 30:02.292
I'm not a commander;
I'm a soldier.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.661
I've read
about many battles,

30:04.729 --> 30:08.698
about the great strategists.
But what I don't understand is this:

30:08.766 --> 30:12.001
how do I know
when it's time to give up?

30:12.069 --> 30:15.038
When do I acknowledge
the better man's victory?

30:15.106 --> 30:19.009
See, the warrior would
never do that.

30:19.076 --> 30:22.112
He'd fight to the death
for something he believed in.

30:24.482 --> 30:26.383
Of course,
at the lowest moment,

30:26.451 --> 30:28.352
you have one opportunity.

30:28.420 --> 30:30.321
And what's that?

30:30.389 --> 30:32.923
When you have nothing
to lose,

30:32.991 --> 30:36.493
that's the time
to risk everything.

30:46.137 --> 30:48.238
Try not to struggle.

30:59.150 --> 31:01.851
I will not die.

31:01.919 --> 31:03.853
Get me through this!

31:03.921 --> 31:07.456
Good.
You hold onto that.

31:07.524 --> 31:09.292
And remember,

31:09.360 --> 31:12.963
you came back here
for a reason.

31:13.031 --> 31:15.065
The crown.

31:15.133 --> 31:17.368
How much does it mean
to you?

31:17.435 --> 31:21.773
- Ev...
- I can't hear you! Talk!

31:21.841 --> 31:24.276
Everything.

31:24.343 --> 31:25.277
What?

31:25.345 --> 31:27.045
Everything!

31:27.113 --> 31:28.813
Then fight!

31:31.884 --> 31:35.753
<i>You deserved</i>
<i>what you got.</i>

31:35.821 --> 31:37.955
Father.

31:38.023 --> 31:41.258
<i>Weak little wretch!</i>

31:44.763 --> 31:47.931
<i>Swear your fealty!</i>

31:47.999 --> 31:49.599
<i>Clever bitch!</i>

31:51.669 --> 31:54.104
<i>I no longer have a daughter.</i>

31:54.172 --> 31:56.274
<i>Clever bitch!</i>
<i>Weak little wretch!</i>

31:56.342 --> 31:58.276
<i>Beaten by a bastard.</i>

32:00.179 --> 32:03.381
<i>Weak little wretch!</i>
<i>Beaten by a bastard.</i>

32:05.585 --> 32:08.520
I'm not beaten!

32:08.588 --> 32:11.457
<i>You deserve what you got--</i>
<i>nothing!</i>

32:17.164 --> 32:20.265
Morgan! Morgan!

32:20.333 --> 32:22.501
Morgan, listen!

32:22.569 --> 32:25.537
How much
do you want the crown?

32:25.604 --> 32:29.107
How much
do you want to live?

32:50.865 --> 32:53.567
<i>A new sword</i>
<i>for a new king.</i>

32:56.270 --> 32:59.172
<i>I gloried in blood.</i>

33:23.766 --> 33:26.268
It's done.

33:26.335 --> 33:28.736
The best I've ever made.

33:43.316 --> 33:44.950
Almost indestructible.

33:45.018 --> 33:47.085
Can I?

33:47.153 --> 33:51.189
I'll give it to the king
myself.

33:51.257 --> 33:54.393
You want the credit
for my work.

33:54.461 --> 33:57.763
No. But I don't need you
near my king.

33:57.831 --> 34:01.234
I'm good enough to make him a weapon,
but not to stand in his presence?

34:03.771 --> 34:06.673
You still have the smell
of blood in your nostrils.

34:06.741 --> 34:09.610
And you still have sorcery
within you.

34:09.678 --> 34:13.848
The sword stays
with me.

34:13.916 --> 34:16.818
You shaped it for the king.

34:16.886 --> 34:18.987
And I'm taking it
to him.

34:19.054 --> 34:21.824
You?

34:23.760 --> 34:26.495
Give me the sword.

34:26.563 --> 34:30.065
Take it.

34:32.467 --> 34:36.471
Come on.
You think I won't fight back?

34:39.873 --> 34:41.108
Oh!

34:52.889 --> 34:57.693
And if you still had a family,
they'd be next!

34:57.761 --> 35:01.531
Don't speak of them!

35:37.134 --> 35:39.235
What've you done?

35:41.606 --> 35:44.508
- There was an accident.
- No, you killed him!

35:44.575 --> 35:45.909
No, no, no, no...

35:50.615 --> 35:53.684
- You killed him for this?
- Give me the sword.

35:58.424 --> 36:01.426
Give me the sword.

36:01.494 --> 36:04.763
You'll never have
this sword!

36:14.674 --> 36:17.710
Excalibur, wait!
Please!

36:19.880 --> 36:21.915
It was an accident!

36:44.638 --> 36:46.873
Excalibur, stop!

36:46.940 --> 36:48.474
Stay away from me!

36:50.444 --> 36:52.312
Give me the sword.

36:52.380 --> 36:55.149
Please, give it to me.
No!

36:55.216 --> 36:57.851
The only place for it is
the bottom of this lake!

37:02.924 --> 37:06.460
...the king must
have his sword...

37:24.313 --> 37:27.215
Stay away
from me!

37:27.282 --> 37:29.317
Leave me alone!

37:31.253 --> 37:33.655
Go away!

37:36.427 --> 37:38.928
Stay where you are.

37:55.179 --> 37:56.979
Excalibur, don't move!

38:03.486 --> 38:05.653
Excalibur!

38:05.721 --> 38:07.655
No!

38:07.723 --> 38:10.157
Excalibur!

38:25.407 --> 38:27.442
Excalibur!

38:38.956 --> 38:42.092
Stay with me!
Stay with me!

38:42.159 --> 38:44.394
Stay with me!

38:44.462 --> 38:46.529
No!

38:46.597 --> 38:47.764
No!

38:47.831 --> 38:51.701
Stay with me!

39:04.714 --> 39:06.782
I'm sorry.

39:42.820 --> 39:44.921
You poor child.

40:11.814 --> 40:13.249
Morgan!

40:34.703 --> 40:37.406
Who are you?

40:48.051 --> 40:49.484
Breathe!

40:49.552 --> 40:52.655
Breathe!
Slowly! Slowly!

40:57.160 --> 40:59.394
I lived.

41:27.821 --> 41:30.222
Go slowly.

41:32.158 --> 41:34.393
You were wrong;
you said I'd die.

41:37.830 --> 41:39.764
You were reborn.

41:39.832 --> 41:42.300
Because I'm strong.

41:47.807 --> 41:49.507
Morgan.

41:49.575 --> 41:52.511
Stay away from me!
Oh, what's this?

42:25.112 --> 42:27.212
Dear God.

42:29.249 --> 42:31.283
What?

42:51.303 --> 42:52.870
No...

42:52.937 --> 42:56.072
No! No, not her!

42:56.140 --> 42:59.042
No, anyone but her!
No!

42:59.110 --> 43:01.044
- Stop! Stop! Stop!
- No!

43:01.112 --> 43:04.949
No, no!
I can't bear it!

43:05.017 --> 43:07.418
Don't fight it. Settle.

43:07.486 --> 43:09.487
Settle.
No...

43:09.555 --> 43:12.223
Inside her.

43:12.291 --> 43:13.724
Breathe.

43:13.792 --> 43:17.295
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

43:17.362 --> 43:19.497
Good.

43:27.040 --> 43:30.942
What?
What is it?

43:31.010 --> 43:34.613
I can feel her.

43:34.680 --> 43:37.148
I can feel
what she's feeling.

43:39.751 --> 43:42.152
She's feeling pain.

44:03.741 --> 44:07.177
There'll be another one
for you.

44:07.245 --> 44:09.312
Guinevere.

44:11.282 --> 44:13.749
I saw
the way you looked at her.

44:13.817 --> 44:16.386
You'll find another.

44:16.453 --> 44:18.755
Is that your motherly advice?

44:18.822 --> 44:22.125
I'm trying
to protect you.

44:22.192 --> 44:23.893
Look somewhere else.

44:23.961 --> 44:26.262
Is that
what you told my father?

44:28.599 --> 44:31.401
Do you have you any idea
how much was destroyed?

44:31.468 --> 44:35.238
How many people died
because he wouldn't be denied?

44:35.306 --> 44:37.707
I will not let that happen
again.

44:47.018 --> 44:50.254
You're late--Your Highness.

44:50.322 --> 44:52.789
You want to know my values.

44:52.857 --> 44:57.862
Well, here they are: when we have
to kill, we do it with mercy.

44:57.929 --> 45:01.699
We do it knowing
we have a higher course.

45:01.766 --> 45:03.701
We fight for peace.

45:03.768 --> 45:05.268
Contradiction in terms.

45:05.336 --> 45:09.339
No. Train for battle;
practice peace.

45:09.407 --> 45:12.576
Combat is the means by which
we achieve other things: honour,

45:12.644 --> 45:16.081
protection, justice.
It is not an end in itself.

45:16.148 --> 45:18.183
Is that it?

45:18.250 --> 45:20.485
No.

45:26.226 --> 45:27.827
Fight me.

45:27.895 --> 45:30.663
Take me down.

45:33.099 --> 45:34.767
It's fine.

46:24.817 --> 46:27.852
Understand when you've been
beaten by a better man.

46:37.263 --> 46:40.633
But never give in!

46:40.701 --> 46:43.203
Never give in.

46:43.270 --> 46:46.840
Even if it feels like
you've lost everything.

46:46.908 --> 46:51.578
And if you have to fight dirty
to protect your cause...

46:51.646 --> 46:55.282
...then so be it.

46:58.485 --> 47:00.386
Now this,

47:00.454 --> 47:02.721
this is a king
I can do business with.

47:15.369 --> 47:17.570
I know what you're doing
and you have to stop.

47:17.638 --> 47:20.573
- I don't know what you mean.
- I have a duty to Leontes.

47:20.641 --> 47:22.709
You have a duty
to your people.

47:22.777 --> 47:26.613
We follow our duties and nothing
we did before matters.

47:26.681 --> 47:29.083
Tell me you have
what you want, and I'll stop.

47:29.151 --> 47:33.253
I saw what you did.

47:33.321 --> 47:36.157
I'm not a fight
you can win.

47:36.225 --> 47:39.628
I'll stop if you look at me
in the eye and say it.

47:43.166 --> 47:44.801
I'm happy.

47:47.138 --> 47:48.905
I have what I want.

47:52.076 --> 47:54.545
Then it's finished.

48:19.003 --> 48:22.572
- Long live the king!
- I'll drink to that.

48:24.509 --> 48:26.543
Fools.

48:28.479 --> 48:30.947
What did you say?

48:31.015 --> 48:34.651
I said your mother must've
wept the day she bore you--

48:34.719 --> 48:37.187
both of you.

48:37.255 --> 48:40.790
I assume you're brothers--
you're ugly enough.

48:53.437 --> 48:55.838
Call that a punch?

49:12.655 --> 49:14.589
Why did you come?

49:14.657 --> 49:17.326
The nunnery burned.

49:20.730 --> 49:22.665
We were attacked.

49:22.732 --> 49:25.601
I was the only survivor.

49:27.971 --> 49:32.075
I'm alone;
it frightens me.

49:36.481 --> 49:38.649
I was drawn here

49:38.717 --> 49:40.618
just when you needed me.

49:40.685 --> 49:45.423
- I don't need you.
- You left us to get the crown.

49:45.491 --> 49:48.026
You don't have it yet.

49:51.998 --> 49:54.265
Vivian.

49:54.333 --> 49:56.934
Make up a bed
for this woman.

49:57.002 --> 50:00.070
As far away from my chamber
as you can find.

50:01.973 --> 50:04.007
Of course.

50:09.847 --> 50:13.818
...so he was coming in
for his third run, right...

50:23.362 --> 50:25.297
What happened
to you?

50:25.364 --> 50:27.399
Doesn't matter.

50:27.467 --> 50:29.901
Of course it does.

50:32.371 --> 50:34.406
Your sword.

51:00.332 --> 51:03.134
Oh, my God.

51:03.202 --> 51:05.337
It's extraordinary.

51:08.608 --> 51:10.809
It's a thing of beauty.

51:10.877 --> 51:13.111
Thank you.

51:13.179 --> 51:16.247
It needs a name.

51:18.317 --> 51:20.385
It already has a name.

51:22.354 --> 51:24.922
Is it from Caliburn,
the man I sent you to see?

51:24.989 --> 51:28.224
No. When I got there,
he was dead.

51:28.292 --> 51:30.727
I rode many miles.

51:34.332 --> 51:36.966
Until I came to a lake.

51:39.670 --> 51:42.972
And everywhere
there was a mist.

51:43.040 --> 51:45.040
I had to stop.

51:46.977 --> 51:48.878
And when I did...

51:50.815 --> 51:53.216
...out of the mist...

51:55.152 --> 51:58.255
...a woman called to me--

51:58.323 --> 52:02.660
like a siren.

52:02.728 --> 52:06.064
From within the lake...

52:08.835 --> 52:11.670
...she stretched out her arm--

52:11.738 --> 52:15.074
this sword,

52:15.141 --> 52:17.743
clutching it.

52:19.647 --> 52:22.583
I took the sword...

52:22.650 --> 52:25.753
...and thanked her.

52:25.820 --> 52:28.789
She smiled...

52:28.857 --> 52:31.091
...and slipped back
into the water.

52:31.159 --> 52:32.759
And as she did...

52:35.663 --> 52:38.597
...she said,

52:38.665 --> 52:42.368
"This is the sword
of King Arthur.

52:42.436 --> 52:44.503
"This...

52:44.571 --> 52:48.173
...is Excalibur".
