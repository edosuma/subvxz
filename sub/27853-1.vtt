Mark!

02:49.927 --> 02:51.593
Mark?

02:51.595 --> 02:52.930
Can you please turn that down?

02:55.232 --> 02:56.868
Can you not hear me?

02:57.200 --> 02:58.999
What are you...

03:21.691 --> 03:22.893
Mark!

03:29.232 --> 03:31.131
Mark!

03:31.133 --> 03:32.570
- Mark!
- Hey!

03:36.138 --> 03:37.738
I'm sorry, Mark.

03:45.349 --> 03:48.082
Get off me,
you fucking cunt!

03:48.084 --> 03:49.185
Shut the fuck up.

04:02.131 --> 04:03.567
Mark!

04:07.937 --> 04:09.940
Get on your knees.
Get on your knees.

04:23.152 --> 04:25.253
What did they do?

04:25.255 --> 04:27.024
They stole from me.

04:28.392 --> 04:30.125
What was it?

04:30.127 --> 04:32.193
Heroin.

04:32.195 --> 04:35.162
Your brother helped this piece of
shit rip two bags from one of my crew.

04:35.164 --> 04:36.299
They broke the code.

04:38.267 --> 04:40.168
- Get him up.
- No, no, no, no!

04:40.170 --> 04:41.839
No, no, no, no...

04:45.409 --> 04:47.842
You either knock him,
or I'll get him to knock you.

04:47.844 --> 04:49.310
I'll fucking do it.
I'll do it.

04:49.312 --> 04:51.111
I'll do it. Give me the gun.
I'll fucking do it.

04:51.113 --> 04:52.816
Give me the gun.
I'll fucking do it.

04:54.116 --> 04:56.087
- Skink, man, don't.
- I'm sorry.

04:57.454 --> 04:59.023
Do it.

05:02.692 --> 05:03.894
Skink...

05:04.795 --> 05:06.163
I'll fucking do it.

05:12.435 --> 05:14.238
You fucking cunt.

05:17.007 --> 05:19.140
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no!

05:24.046 --> 05:25.212
Right over there.

05:28.217 --> 05:29.719
Come on, hurry up.

05:32.288 --> 05:34.154
There.

05:34.156 --> 05:35.659
Dig it deep.
Shoulder height.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.269
Fuck me.
What happened to you?

05:47.904 --> 05:50.305
Dad threw boiling
water on my back.

05:50.307 --> 05:52.076
So, I stabbed the cunt
in the throat.

05:53.110 --> 05:54.412
And threw him
in the river.

06:00.349 --> 06:02.116
Rules are rules.

06:02.118 --> 06:03.921
How's he gonna
get to learn?

06:07.890 --> 06:09.225
I will work something out.

06:14.764 --> 06:15.863
I've got a good idea.

06:15.865 --> 06:16.964
Why don't you bring
your bitch?

06:16.966 --> 06:18.301
I'll introduce her
to my bitches.

06:22.404 --> 06:24.505
Don't you fucking
touch her.

06:24.507 --> 06:25.774
Don't you fucking...

06:44.461 --> 06:45.993
Get down!

06:47.397 --> 06:50.063
The bitches always
the best fighters, you know.

06:50.065 --> 06:53.337
I mean, these ones, they
prefer to fight than fuck.

06:54.538 --> 06:56.273
I gotta strap 'em down
to breed.

06:58.440 --> 06:59.310
It's called a rape stand.

07:01.178 --> 07:02.577
But now they're angry.

07:02.579 --> 07:04.411
And every time they're
looking at me, I swear to God,

07:04.413 --> 07:06.416
they're planning some
type of payback.

07:08.450 --> 07:09.851
Your bitch ever look
at you like that?

07:09.853 --> 07:11.088
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:13.990 --> 07:16.327
What? Should we
let 'em out?

07:17.092 --> 07:18.194
Eh?

07:20.397 --> 07:22.996
They'll rip your fucking
throat out.

07:30.974 --> 07:32.776
You wanna save your brother?

07:34.945 --> 07:36.977
I wanna do business.

07:36.979 --> 07:38.613
You've done well
for yourself, Paddo.

07:38.615 --> 07:40.251
Got a lot of cash
that needs cleaning.

07:41.584 --> 07:44.154
We own a pub,
we own a restaurant.

07:45.055 --> 07:46.322
We can wash your cash.

07:47.123 --> 07:48.526
Yeah, I can do that.

07:49.425 --> 07:52.392
I do that, I get 30%.

07:52.394 --> 07:54.061
And we wanna sell
to your customers.

07:57.166 --> 07:59.369
Oh, she's a merry little
fucking thing, isn't she?

08:03.373 --> 08:05.375
Back the fuck up, pal.

08:07.043 --> 08:08.312
I'll take 30%,

08:09.378 --> 08:11.281
and I'll wash your cash.
Hmm?

08:12.882 --> 08:14.883
Or I'll kill that simple cunt.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.183
All right?

08:16.185 --> 08:17.517
Now there,
you'd like to do that?

08:17.519 --> 08:18.322
Okay!

08:20.156 --> 08:21.158
"Okay"?

08:32.934 --> 08:35.336
Why?

08:35.337 --> 08:37.203
I was thinking of getting
a bike for meself.

08:37.206 --> 08:38.472
You've got
a fucking bike, Adam.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.640
It's his old one.
He rode around that...

08:40.643 --> 08:42.409
You're not doing
a fucking thing

08:42.410 --> 08:44.381
without me from now on.
Do you understand?

08:46.382 --> 08:47.450
Yes.

08:49.551 --> 08:50.421
Is there any left?

08:52.055 --> 08:53.056
No.

08:58.127 --> 08:59.430
You fuck.

09:02.198 --> 09:04.901
He fucking tricked me.
I had no fucking idea.

09:31.328 --> 09:32.363
You all right?

10:21.344 --> 10:22.510
Hand 'em over.

10:22.512 --> 10:24.779
- What?
- Do you think I'm dumb?

10:24.781 --> 10:25.646
Jesus Christ!

10:25.648 --> 10:27.483
Never mind the blasphemy.
Give 'em here.

10:30.552 --> 10:31.554
Are we clear?

10:32.722 --> 10:35.323
<i>I don't give a fuck how
many of these you swallow</i>

10:35.325 --> 10:37.491
<i>or you stick up your arse
when you're not here.</i>

10:37.493 --> 10:39.363
But in the club,
these are banned.

10:40.497 --> 10:41.498
Them the rules.

10:41.765 --> 10:43.133
Piss off.

10:44.633 --> 10:46.202
Oi, Paddo.

10:48.171 --> 10:49.305
Check that other one
on the side.

10:51.641 --> 10:53.073
TVs?

10:53.075 --> 10:54.243
Yeah.

10:55.545 --> 10:56.613
Huge ones.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.483
Katrina's idea.
Like 'em?

11:00.717 --> 11:02.784
Youse didn't come
to me.

11:06.790 --> 11:08.392
What happened to you?

11:14.531 --> 11:17.534
You know what? Give Knuck and I
45 minutes before you come in.

11:19.701 --> 11:21.037
He's only gotten out.

11:22.571 --> 11:25.508
Well, then, tell me what you wanna
tell him, and I'll pass it on.

11:30.180 --> 11:31.281
Or don't.

11:54.603 --> 11:57.572
Push back on the gun. Push back on
the gun, you fucking weird cunt.

12:26.335 --> 12:30.571
Listen to me. You need to take
charge as soon as you get out.

12:30.573 --> 12:31.706
Oh, I am in charge.

12:31.708 --> 12:34.274
Nah. It's not the same
when you're in here.

12:34.276 --> 12:35.909
Listen, Hayley,

12:35.911 --> 12:38.178
Paddo will fall in
when I get out.

12:38.180 --> 12:40.751
And he's gonna do that
because I put him there.

12:41.718 --> 12:43.483
I don't trust him.

12:45.188 --> 12:46.623
You don't trust anyone.

12:51.794 --> 12:53.361
He tried to fuck you,
did he?

12:53.363 --> 12:55.428
Nah.

12:55.430 --> 12:56.566
No, he didn't try
to fuck me.

12:57.767 --> 13:00.934
Just show him
you're the president,

13:00.936 --> 13:03.139
and do it so
the men can see it.

13:07.911 --> 13:09.313
They gotten bigger?

13:12.714 --> 13:15.482
You just puffed yourself
out like a toadfish.

13:15.484 --> 13:17.217
I didn't do anything.

13:17.219 --> 13:18.754
No. Bigger.

13:20.690 --> 13:22.289
- You look good.
- Really?

13:22.291 --> 13:23.627
Way bigger.

13:29.299 --> 13:30.367
I love you.

13:59.695 --> 14:00.696
What did she say?

14:02.965 --> 14:04.765
She said you are
trying to fuck her.

14:09.571 --> 14:10.740
I've got a proposition.

14:12.407 --> 14:13.409
From who?

14:14.444 --> 14:15.512
Devils.

14:17.879 --> 14:18.748
And what is it?

14:19.882 --> 14:21.517
They can wash our paper.

14:23.886 --> 14:24.986
Can they?

14:24.988 --> 14:26.721
Knuck, there's too much
of it, mate.

14:26.723 --> 14:28.021
It's useless if we
can't filter it.

14:28.023 --> 14:29.425
If we wash it,

14:30.526 --> 14:31.695
we can buy assets.

14:32.929 --> 14:34.794
Legit.

14:34.796 --> 14:37.367
Renovate the clubhouse.
We can buy a house.

14:38.568 --> 14:39.770
Well, that'll be good,
wouldn't it?

14:41.036 --> 14:42.439
And what'll they want?

14:43.006 --> 14:44.739
Thirty percent.

14:44.741 --> 14:46.610
- Which is nothing.
- No.

14:47.310 --> 14:48.875
It's 30%.

14:48.877 --> 14:50.314
Sugar come to you
with this thing?

14:52.614 --> 14:53.616
Yes.

14:55.785 --> 14:57.717
Oh.

14:57.719 --> 14:59.922
So, what, you and Sugar are
fucking best friends now, are you?

15:05.862 --> 15:07.331
It's a good deal, Knuck.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.703
I wouldn't be coming to you
if it wasn't.

15:20.575 --> 15:21.811
You got to think
about it.

15:26.815 --> 15:28.448
What happened to you face?

15:28.450 --> 15:31.622
A little scrap at the pub.
Some fucking muppet.

15:33.055 --> 15:34.688
How's Skink?

15:34.690 --> 15:36.691
Good. Yeah.

15:36.693 --> 15:38.862
Besides whacking too much
in the shower, he's good.

15:41.597 --> 15:42.799
All right.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.601
You set it up with
your mate Sugar.

15:47.603 --> 15:49.770
But you set it up day
one I get out next week.

15:49.772 --> 15:51.105
You understand that?

15:51.107 --> 15:52.843
- Day one.
- Okay.

16:07.857 --> 16:08.858
What did he say?

16:10.892 --> 16:11.927
He said yes?

16:13.662 --> 16:15.298
He said he'd set up
a meeting.

16:15.732 --> 16:16.800
A meeting?

16:17.666 --> 16:18.668
With who?

16:20.369 --> 16:21.568
Sugar.

16:21.570 --> 16:22.839
When?

16:25.974 --> 16:26.976
When he gets out?

16:28.677 --> 16:30.579
- Yes.
- Shit, Mark.

16:39.921 --> 16:41.654
Baby.

16:41.656 --> 16:44.658
We gotta be careful.

16:44.660 --> 16:47.497
He gets out after three years and
we just hand everything over to him?

16:49.866 --> 16:50.901
It's not like that.

16:52.401 --> 16:54.838
It's good business, Kat.
It legitimizes everything.

16:57.006 --> 16:58.375
He'll see that.

17:01.844 --> 17:02.878
And Skink's okay.

17:11.787 --> 17:13.589
You should be president,
you know that?

17:15.190 --> 17:17.460
He couldn't have done
what you've done.

17:18.928 --> 17:20.530
He doesn't have
the brains.

17:26.768 --> 17:28.704
Do you know what those men
see in you?

17:31.007 --> 17:32.409
What I see in you?

17:35.076 --> 17:36.412
We'd die for you.

18:29.231 --> 18:31.631
You don't utter my name
to anyone.

18:31.633 --> 18:33.667
You do it
and I'll find out.

18:33.669 --> 18:35.636
Then I'll murder some cunt
just to get back in here

18:35.638 --> 18:36.973
so I can cut your throat.

18:38.641 --> 18:40.107
You understand?

19:04.534 --> 19:05.669
Stop it now.

19:10.672 --> 19:11.907
It's okay.

19:13.008 --> 19:14.478
Shh.

19:30.559 --> 19:32.092
Where's your drink, dude?

19:32.094 --> 19:33.830
You're an idiot, Webby. You
know it's fucking Ramadan?

19:34.229 --> 19:36.764
- Ramadan?
- Mmm.

19:36.766 --> 19:38.064
- Fuck Ramadan.
- Fuck Ramadan.

19:38.066 --> 19:39.733
- And fuck you.
- Fuck me?

19:39.735 --> 19:42.303
It's a bar.
You're here to drink.

19:42.305 --> 19:44.237
You don't like it,
you can fuck off.

19:44.239 --> 19:46.073
Hey, you're a fat cunt,
Webby.

19:46.075 --> 19:47.507
Count these...

19:47.509 --> 19:49.776
Skinks, Paddo reckons you got
in a bit of a scrap the other night.

19:51.080 --> 19:52.916
Yeah, yeah.

19:55.183 --> 19:57.051
So, how many
were there, brother?

19:57.053 --> 19:58.619
I don't know,
they all look the same.

19:58.621 --> 20:00.086
They're all a bunch
of perm heads.

20:01.723 --> 20:04.091
So, did you flog 'em
or what?

20:04.093 --> 20:07.226
Yeah, well... One of
them hit me in the face.

20:07.228 --> 20:09.095
I had blood
coming out of my nose,

20:09.097 --> 20:11.899
so I got him
in an arm bar,

20:11.901 --> 20:14.267
and then I broke
his femur, and the...

20:14.269 --> 20:15.703
That's enough.

20:15.705 --> 20:17.073
That's enough, man.

20:19.642 --> 20:21.374
Even this will keep you
in the camp for a week.

20:21.376 --> 20:22.578
Jesus.

20:23.613 --> 20:24.711
You should follow
me down.

20:24.713 --> 20:26.714
Shot you a rim job
with me missus.

20:26.716 --> 20:28.051
Got a tongue like
a lizard.

20:29.218 --> 20:32.252
Oh, come on.

20:32.254 --> 20:34.090
Dib's gonna need
a little extra this week.

20:36.292 --> 20:38.626
He got fired. It was a layoff thing.
It wasn't his fault, all right?

20:38.628 --> 20:39.629
He needs a hand.

21:02.817 --> 21:04.119
Look at you.

21:09.290 --> 21:11.257
You could have got
a nom to come and get me.

21:11.259 --> 21:14.129
Please. They can't hit 50
without shitting their pants.

21:17.132 --> 21:19.265
Did you look after him?

21:19.267 --> 21:20.636
Fucking, nos.

21:34.984 --> 21:36.720
- Wanna go home?
- Yeah.

21:48.797 --> 21:49.965
Yeah.

21:51.132 --> 21:52.701
Push your fucking back on it.
Push.

21:54.469 --> 21:55.805
Fuck!

22:07.216 --> 22:08.218
Give it here.

22:19.461 --> 22:20.863
Oi.

22:30.405 --> 22:31.840
It's the way
it should be.

22:43.352 --> 22:44.754
Thank you.

22:47.856 --> 22:48.958
I missed you.

22:50.759 --> 22:52.327
I really
fucking missed you.

22:53.362 --> 22:54.964
Yeah, I missed you too.

22:57.399 --> 22:58.735
What was it like
in there?

22:59.869 --> 23:01.237
You saw me in there.

23:02.103 --> 23:03.370
That's what it's like.

23:03.372 --> 23:05.208
Anyone try to
come after you?

23:06.374 --> 23:07.776
And do what?

23:09.879 --> 23:11.245
Give you the bash
or something?

23:13.114 --> 23:14.247
- Bash?
- Yeah.

23:14.249 --> 23:17.252
Nah. No one tried
to give me the bash.

23:20.122 --> 23:21.291
'Cause you're not
going back.

23:23.325 --> 23:24.193
You're right.

23:27.162 --> 23:29.231
I wanna try for
a kid again, Knuck.

24:13.942 --> 24:16.376
What, Knuck wants his own
song to come in to, does he?

24:16.378 --> 24:17.945
What, his own
national anthem?

24:21.182 --> 24:22.285
Knuck!

24:23.352 --> 24:25.388
Jeez! You look big.

24:26.121 --> 24:27.123
Or bigger.

24:28.623 --> 24:30.226
You still got that, uh,

24:31.192 --> 24:32.993
skinny flexing arm?

24:32.995 --> 24:34.330
Why, sure. Bomber.

24:38.433 --> 24:41.067
You're still a vodka and
orange man, aren't you, Knuck?

24:41.069 --> 24:43.970
Hey, look. A nice little pink
umbrella there for you, too.

24:43.972 --> 24:46.406
Or do you want me to get you
a low carb beer?

24:46.408 --> 24:47.341
Or maybe even a light?

24:47.343 --> 24:49.245
How about we just
get down to business, huh?

24:50.478 --> 24:52.382
Yeah, sure, Paddo.

24:54.516 --> 24:57.083
Paddo tells me you want
30% to clean our paper.

24:57.085 --> 24:58.253
Correct weight.

24:59.622 --> 25:01.321
Okay.

25:01.323 --> 25:02.488
What happens then?

25:02.490 --> 25:04.059
Oh, you'll make money.

25:05.059 --> 25:06.927
Legitimate money.

25:06.929 --> 25:09.563
And you're not gonna try and
renegotiate your fee or anything?

25:09.565 --> 25:11.931
Nah!
You have my word.

25:14.003 --> 25:16.370
Back the fuck up.

25:16.372 --> 25:18.537
And stay real fucking...

25:18.539 --> 25:19.939
Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

25:19.941 --> 25:21.510
Hey, look at me.

25:22.378 --> 25:23.546
You think it's funny?

25:24.380 --> 25:25.512
Can you read that?

25:25.514 --> 25:26.580
Right?

25:26.582 --> 25:28.015
That says "president."

25:28.017 --> 25:30.918
So I'm still the president,
not him.

25:30.920 --> 25:32.552
Not him. You ask me.

25:32.554 --> 25:35.188
So, if I ever catch you talking
to any of my men about business,

25:35.190 --> 25:37.424
I'll tie a dishwasher
around your ankles,

25:37.426 --> 25:39.426
and I'll drop you
in one of your billabongs.

25:50.305 --> 25:53.439
Hey, Knuck, you forgot to drink
your vodka and orange juice,

25:53.441 --> 25:55.044
you fucking rude cunt.

25:59.715 --> 26:01.451
Can you please put
your shirt on, mate?

26:14.595 --> 26:16.228
Oh, you all right?

26:16.230 --> 26:18.300
- I'm sorry.
- Jeez!

26:21.603 --> 26:22.906
Fuck.

26:25.306 --> 26:26.508
What are you reading?

26:29.111 --> 26:30.610
New cars?

26:30.612 --> 26:33.179
Mark doesn't drive cars,
just Harleys.

26:33.181 --> 26:34.613
Yeah, well, I'll be
driving it, won't I?

26:34.615 --> 26:37.184
Are you driving to
Knuck's party tonight?

26:37.186 --> 26:38.421
I'm gonna try
and be with Josie.

26:39.654 --> 26:41.456
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

26:42.357 --> 26:43.724
Why?

26:43.726 --> 26:45.594
Because you and her
are different.

26:47.496 --> 26:49.299
You're different than Mark.

26:54.536 --> 26:57.137
Well, I just don't think she'll
be very nice to you, okay?

26:57.139 --> 26:59.208
She's nice to me. She's
nice to me all the time.

27:01.543 --> 27:02.809
Hey, one on the pokeys.

27:02.811 --> 27:04.745
- What happened?
- Oh, he threw it straight back at Sugar.

27:04.747 --> 27:06.646
That was supposed
to get Skink square, Mark.

27:06.648 --> 27:08.184
Do you realize what
that means?

27:09.651 --> 27:11.120
If Knuck doesn't do this,
I'll kill him, Mark.

27:12.054 --> 27:13.620
You need to convince him.

27:13.622 --> 27:15.190
I'll take care of it.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.535
What the fuck is he wearing?

28:00.568 --> 28:02.037
We got new hoodies.

28:03.205 --> 28:04.607
Take it off.

28:05.807 --> 28:07.239
What?

28:07.241 --> 28:08.577
What are you looking
at him for?

28:11.212 --> 28:12.714
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

28:14.348 --> 28:16.585
Well, you seem like a real
fucking prospect, don't you?

28:18.687 --> 28:20.223
Who are you?

28:20.855 --> 28:22.257
I'm David Seamus.

28:22.757 --> 28:24.393
He's an accountant.

28:25.460 --> 28:26.496
So you've been
counting my money?

28:28.263 --> 28:29.396
Yeah.

28:29.398 --> 28:31.264
You look at him again while
I'm asking you a question,

28:31.266 --> 28:32.535
I'm gonna bite
your fucking nose off.

28:34.870 --> 28:36.305
He's a good kid, Knuck.

28:38.606 --> 28:39.508
We could use him.

28:44.212 --> 28:45.414
I'll tell you what, David.

28:46.481 --> 28:48.415
You take that thing off,

28:48.417 --> 28:50.520
go outside and put it
in that big fire.

28:55.123 --> 28:56.592
- Fuck off.
- Yeah.

28:59.728 --> 29:03.162
- They're banned.
- Why?

29:03.164 --> 29:05.534
Because we're a 1% club,
not a fucking netball team.

29:12.306 --> 29:14.674
Hey, Notu, do us
a favor, would ya?

29:14.676 --> 29:16.775
- Yo.
- Take off the hoodies, whoever's got 'em.

29:16.777 --> 29:19.178
Fuck! I knew he wouldn't
have liked them.

29:38.467 --> 29:39.701
Hey, Josie.

29:40.469 --> 29:41.668
Hi, Adam.

29:41.670 --> 29:43.370
What are you doing?

29:43.372 --> 29:44.737
Talking to you.

30:06.661 --> 30:07.796
You got a new tat.

30:08.663 --> 30:09.798
Yeah.

30:10.632 --> 30:11.767
I got it for Knuck.

30:13.802 --> 30:15.605
I'm thinking of getting
one on me bonnet.

30:16.572 --> 30:18.470
You know,
as a surprise.

30:18.472 --> 30:19.839
Why the fuck
would you do that?

30:19.841 --> 30:21.744
'Cause he would
fucking love it.

30:25.247 --> 30:26.649
Do you want any drugs?

30:27.216 --> 30:28.582
I got some.

30:28.584 --> 30:30.850
You know we're not allowed to
in the clubhouse, Skink.

30:30.852 --> 30:32.555
You don't have to
pay for any.

30:40.362 --> 30:41.663
What would I have to do?

30:43.731 --> 30:44.834
What would you do?

30:46.701 --> 30:47.903
Would I have to fuck you?

30:49.438 --> 30:50.836
You can if you want.

30:50.838 --> 30:52.340
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:55.710 --> 30:56.845
Let me think about it.

31:12.460 --> 31:14.828
You make sure that every nom
can ride from here on.

31:14.830 --> 31:16.265
Every one of them.

31:18.866 --> 31:20.734
I'll get 'em around to it.

31:20.736 --> 31:23.637
I don't care if you make him jump
through rings of fucking fire, Webby.

31:23.639 --> 31:25.641
Just make sure they don't
embarrass me on a run.

31:28.744 --> 31:30.877
Come out and have
a drink with your men.

31:30.879 --> 31:33.716
You haven't seen most
of them for three years.

31:34.650 --> 31:36.382
Go talk to 'em.

31:36.384 --> 31:37.617
About what?

31:37.619 --> 31:39.722
I don't know.
Ask them how they've been.

31:41.823 --> 31:42.959
Can you move for a sec?

31:43.592 --> 31:44.759
Please?

31:50.332 --> 31:52.631
I swear on this nom.

31:52.633 --> 31:53.803
This accountant.

31:56.805 --> 31:57.738
You look good, bro.

32:18.427 --> 32:19.762
Whoa!

32:23.931 --> 32:25.799
You had enough, Noisy?

32:25.801 --> 32:27.967
You nominated this prick,
all right?

32:27.969 --> 32:30.704
You're gonna look him in the eye
and flog him like I flogged you.

32:30.706 --> 32:31.807
Hear that, Noisy?
Look up.

32:40.848 --> 32:42.317
Stand him up.
Stand him up, Webby.

32:42.817 --> 32:44.719
Stand him up.

32:48.556 --> 32:52.359
You have David Seamus,
who's the fucking accountant.

32:52.361 --> 32:54.463
Do you swear allegiance
to me,

32:55.697 --> 32:57.996
and the Copperhead
Motorcycle Club, Australia?

32:57.998 --> 32:59.498
- Yes.
- Yeah?

32:59.500 --> 33:00.667
Yeah.

33:00.669 --> 33:02.004
- To me?
- Yes.

33:08.043 --> 33:09.645
Look at me.

33:09.878 --> 33:11.710
Hmm?

33:17.986 --> 33:19.354
Hmm?

33:29.029 --> 33:31.733
So... I'm back.

33:33.901 --> 33:35.768
And there's a lot of faces
here I don't know.

33:35.770 --> 33:36.838
I've never seen 'em
before in my life.

33:38.038 --> 33:39.575
I have no idea
who you are.

33:41.709 --> 33:42.978
I don't know
who the fuck you are.

33:44.513 --> 33:45.915
But you've all been
vouched for.

33:47.848 --> 33:48.917
So I will say what,
we'll see.

33:50.919 --> 33:53.855
You wanna nominate anyone,
you bring him before me.

33:54.922 --> 33:55.990
Me only.

33:56.892 --> 33:58.024
You understand?

33:58.026 --> 33:59.092
Yes.

33:59.094 --> 34:00.192
Answer your pres!

34:00.194 --> 34:01.527
Yes!

34:01.529 --> 34:02.961
Get him up.

34:02.963 --> 34:04.030
Come on, come on.

34:08.003 --> 34:09.601
I got you.

34:14.208 --> 34:15.944
All the best.

34:21.917 --> 34:23.119
Copperhead forever!

34:24.985 --> 34:26.553
Copperhead forever!

34:27.955 --> 34:30.790
Webby, love him up,
sew him up.

35:51.739 --> 35:53.205
Thanks.

35:57.044 --> 35:58.680
Welcome back, Pres.

36:01.582 --> 36:03.583
Looks like a big
fucking lolly.

36:09.290 --> 36:10.593
Already got a bike.

36:14.029 --> 36:15.862
Hey!

36:15.864 --> 36:18.830
Someone's gonna work dick
and that's me!

36:24.306 --> 36:26.138
Bloody Tracey, everybody.

36:34.214 --> 36:35.348
Pay up.

36:38.218 --> 36:39.554
Bullshit.

37:07.649 --> 37:09.114
You're fucking smoking.

37:09.116 --> 37:10.285
Stop it.

37:12.087 --> 37:13.922
- Boost!
- Fluke.

37:15.122 --> 37:16.788
No, it's not.

37:16.790 --> 37:18.126
I never miss.
I'm too good.

37:24.632 --> 37:26.067
Good shot.

37:38.812 --> 37:40.148
That bike looks
very flash.

37:47.855 --> 37:49.991
I thought you were gonna
take care of this, Mark.

37:58.198 --> 37:59.866
Knuck, can I have a word?

37:59.868 --> 38:01.134
In a minute?

38:01.136 --> 38:02.271
Right now.

38:09.310 --> 38:12.812
Yeah, what now? It must feel
different being out, I know.

38:12.814 --> 38:16.281
Feel different being here. I've
only tried to make you feel welcome.

38:16.283 --> 38:17.819
- Welcome?
- Yes, Knuck.

38:18.786 --> 38:20.853
In here, my club?

38:20.855 --> 38:22.721
- You asked me to look after things.
- Yeah.

38:22.723 --> 38:26.194
To look after the men.
I've done what you asked.

38:27.062 --> 38:28.960
- I wanted you to...
- What?

38:28.962 --> 38:30.962
I wanted to hand it back to you in
better shape than when you went in.

38:30.964 --> 38:32.800
More money, more men.

38:34.301 --> 38:35.671
No trouble.

38:37.705 --> 38:39.304
Things are different now.

38:39.306 --> 38:40.440
If we're smart,
everything changes.

38:40.442 --> 38:42.808
We'll never have to look
over our shoulder ever again.

38:42.810 --> 38:44.476
We never have to worry about money.

38:44.478 --> 38:46.312
We never have to
worry about other clubs.

38:46.314 --> 38:47.982
About the fucking Jacks?

38:49.317 --> 38:51.717
Oh, is that what your
fucking mate Sugar told you?

38:51.719 --> 38:52.884
What the fuck
is your obsession with...

38:52.886 --> 38:54.886
Listen. Listen to me.

38:54.888 --> 38:57.223
And you listen really
fucking carefully.

38:57.225 --> 38:58.924
Things aren't different
out here now.

38:58.926 --> 39:00.161
Not while I'm involved.

39:00.828 --> 39:01.897
Hmm?

39:02.730 --> 39:04.230
And I don't want
anyone's help.

39:04.232 --> 39:05.397
Do you understand that?

39:05.399 --> 39:07.266
And I'm not gonna
split money,

39:07.268 --> 39:11.404
and I'm never, ever gonna sit around
the table with some other cunt

39:11.406 --> 39:16.007
from another club and talk about
how we can help each other.

39:16.009 --> 39:19.247
And I never asked you
to do any of that.

39:20.415 --> 39:21.717
Did I?

39:23.183 --> 39:24.719
- Did I? No.
- No.

39:27.321 --> 39:29.855
Now, we've got more money.

39:29.857 --> 39:32.227
And we've got more men, for
good or bad, we're fine now.

39:33.495 --> 39:34.863
So thank you.

39:46.306 --> 39:48.276
What the fuck, Skink?
Shut the fuck up.

39:51.044 --> 39:52.213
So, what do you got?

39:53.080 --> 39:54.279
I got some goey.

39:54.281 --> 39:56.348
Some speed?

39:56.350 --> 39:58.116
Fuck that, Skink.

39:58.118 --> 39:59.254
Wait.

40:00.288 --> 40:01.990
I got some hezza.

40:03.892 --> 40:05.558
It's mine.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.292
But I'm not supposed
to have it.

40:07.294 --> 40:09.764
So, you can't tell.

40:13.134 --> 40:15.070
If I give it to you,
you cannot tell.

40:20.274 --> 40:21.440
Do you like that?

40:41.462 --> 40:43.832
Hey, brother!

40:49.370 --> 40:51.006
Must be good to
have him back.

40:52.006 --> 40:53.438
Yeah, it is.

40:56.310 --> 40:58.180
Bet he can't keep
his hands off you.

40:58.846 --> 41:00.015
Yeah.

41:04.319 --> 41:05.853
He did okay,
your bloke.

41:07.622 --> 41:08.890
Yeah, he had some help.

41:10.991 --> 41:12.326
Knuck will take it
from here but.

41:14.328 --> 41:15.296
Yeah, we'll see,
I guess.

41:19.234 --> 41:20.902
I may not be that smart,

41:21.902 --> 41:24.002
but I do know
paying someone else

41:24.004 --> 41:26.004
to do something you can
do yourself

41:26.006 --> 41:27.375
is fucking stupid.

41:33.647 --> 41:36.147
Hey, hey...

41:36.149 --> 41:37.819
Josie licked my ears.

41:39.152 --> 41:42.256
Uh-huh?
Just ears?

41:44.359 --> 41:46.061
She touched my dick too.

41:52.165 --> 41:54.366
I knew it!
I fucking knew it!

41:54.368 --> 41:56.534
It's just...

41:56.536 --> 41:58.370
It's all just
part of the initiation.

41:58.372 --> 41:59.404
Yeah.

41:59.406 --> 42:01.339
- It happened to me.
- Yeah.

42:01.341 --> 42:03.344
I had my nose broken
and everything.

42:04.645 --> 42:07.181
Yeah, yeah. Paddo told me.
Yeah, it's all good.

42:09.116 --> 42:10.382
So where are you from?

42:10.384 --> 42:11.549
Uh, Sydney.

42:11.551 --> 42:13.252
Come over to go to uni.

42:13.254 --> 42:14.587
You're being a real
smart fucker.

42:18.026 --> 42:19.861
Smart fucker who
likes to ride motorbikes.

42:21.428 --> 42:23.194
Sort of, yeah.

42:23.196 --> 42:25.498
I only started last year when
I met Katrina and Paddo, so...

42:25.500 --> 42:26.568
And you like 'em?

42:27.567 --> 42:29.103
You like
Paddo and Katrina?

42:30.705 --> 42:32.437
Yeah.

42:32.439 --> 42:34.408
They're real good people.
Paddo...

42:36.076 --> 42:37.446
Really looks after
his brother.

42:38.446 --> 42:39.480
Like no other.

42:41.448 --> 42:42.450
So, what are you riding?

42:43.317 --> 42:46.618
A, uh, Sportster.

42:46.620 --> 42:48.422
Hmm.

42:53.160 --> 42:54.562
You can ride that new thing
if you want.

42:58.299 --> 43:00.165
That's your present.

43:00.167 --> 43:01.502
Not really my style.

43:07.241 --> 43:08.377
I could teach you
to ride.

43:11.145 --> 43:12.478
- If you want.
- Yeah.

43:12.480 --> 43:13.980
All right.

43:13.982 --> 43:15.117
We could

43:16.616 --> 43:18.286
come a few rounds with me.

43:19.453 --> 43:20.388
Show you around.

43:21.656 --> 43:23.621
- You wanna?
- Yeah.

43:23.623 --> 43:25.190
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:25.192 --> 43:26.428
You're awesome.

43:29.629 --> 43:31.163
What the fuck
are you doing?

43:31.165 --> 43:33.598
What the fuck are you...
I told you!

43:33.600 --> 43:35.000
Get off me!

43:35.002 --> 43:36.268
Shut up, bitch.

43:36.270 --> 43:37.636
Get off me!

43:37.638 --> 43:39.337
You fucking slut!

43:43.310 --> 43:44.743
Let her go.
Let her go.

43:44.745 --> 43:46.344
Get your hands off her.

43:46.346 --> 43:47.779
Let her go.
What is going on?

43:47.781 --> 43:50.451
Look at her.
She's off her fucking chops.

43:54.055 --> 43:55.357
You fucking slut.

44:04.698 --> 44:08.033
Hey! Are you fucking stupid?

44:08.035 --> 44:11.536
Seriously! What the fuck is wrong with you?
What's this?

44:11.538 --> 44:13.505
Jesus fucking...
Come here, you...

44:13.507 --> 44:17.143
I get out one fucking day.
I'm out one fucking day,

44:17.145 --> 44:18.676
and you want me to
go back to fucking prison?

44:18.678 --> 44:20.413
This is fucking heroin.

44:20.415 --> 44:21.647
It wasn't mine.

44:21.649 --> 44:23.549
It's not yours?
Where'd you get it?

44:23.551 --> 44:25.487
Where did you
fucking get it?

44:27.355 --> 44:28.487
Who?

44:28.489 --> 44:29.691
- Who?
- Skink!

44:31.259 --> 44:33.158
- Come here.
- I'm sorry Skink.

44:33.160 --> 44:35.560
I didn't sell it
to her.

44:35.562 --> 44:37.164
I didn't sell it
to her, Knuck.

44:40.201 --> 44:41.536
You gonna hit me?

44:48.576 --> 44:49.678
You simple fuck.

44:53.580 --> 44:55.750
Your old man should have
drowned you at birth.

44:58.585 --> 45:00.219
You're out.

45:00.221 --> 45:01.286
No, Knuck...

45:01.288 --> 45:03.855
Webby, you fat fuck,
take his cards.

45:03.857 --> 45:06.125
Knuck, I can... No!

45:06.127 --> 45:07.725
- No, no, Webby.
- Take it off.

45:07.727 --> 45:09.728
- No, this is my jacket!
- Take it off.

45:09.730 --> 45:11.629
This is my jacket!

45:11.631 --> 45:13.501
- Take it off.
- I fought with this jacket! No! No, no!

45:16.136 --> 45:17.538
You know
I didn't mean it.

45:19.140 --> 45:20.239
Come on.

45:22.143 --> 45:23.676
Turn on the music.

45:23.678 --> 45:25.313
Turn it back on now.

45:35.723 --> 45:37.325
He pissed himself, Mark.

45:42.730 --> 45:44.864
Okay, come on. It's all right.
You're all right.

45:44.866 --> 45:46.431
You're all right, mate,
you're all right.

45:46.433 --> 45:47.632
Breathe.

45:47.634 --> 45:49.234
Come on,
you're all right.

45:49.236 --> 45:51.170
You wanna take a shower?
Let's take a shower.

45:51.172 --> 45:52.638
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.

45:52.640 --> 45:54.440
Let's take a shower.

47:01.709 --> 47:02.810
Ah, fuck.

47:05.812 --> 47:08.716
Hey, we're off? I think
we're done here, so...

47:10.384 --> 47:11.386
What's got into you?

47:30.238 --> 47:31.406
What are you doing?

47:39.446 --> 47:41.346
Let go of me,
you fuckin' cunt.

47:41.348 --> 47:42.350
Get off me.

47:56.529 --> 47:57.596
Bugger.

47:57.598 --> 47:58.797
Shut up.

47:58.799 --> 48:00.235
Shut up.

48:49.783 --> 48:51.852
Just throw your shit
on the fuckin' floor.

49:01.861 --> 49:02.930
Kid gone, eh?

49:05.700 --> 49:07.002
I'll be outside
doing some quin.

50:05.759 --> 50:06.995
We should move away
from here.

50:09.029 --> 50:10.565
- Why?
- Just...

50:12.132 --> 50:13.401
Enjoy.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.069
Where?

50:25.145 --> 50:26.879
Queensland.

50:28.415 --> 50:30.616
I fucking hate
Queensland.

50:30.618 --> 50:31.917
Where else
would you go?

50:31.919 --> 50:33.919
You wouldn't know anyone
there, Mark.

50:33.921 --> 50:35.457
Yeah, that's the point.

50:39.893 --> 50:41.592
That's the point.

50:41.594 --> 50:42.930
I don't know anyone there.

50:46.933 --> 50:47.901
Fresh start.

50:52.806 --> 50:53.975
No baggage.

51:04.451 --> 51:06.020
You listen to me,

51:07.187 --> 51:10.721
we're not going anywhere.

51:10.723 --> 51:13.894
We've worked too hard to get to where
we are, we're not giving that up.

51:18.933 --> 51:20.899
And I know you'll do
whatever it takes

51:20.901 --> 51:23.071
to look after us, that's
why I love you so much.

51:25.573 --> 51:26.839
That's why those men
love you,

51:26.841 --> 51:28.810
that's why Knuck
is so fucking threatened.

51:30.777 --> 51:32.944
You are not
the sort of man

51:32.946 --> 51:35.015
that walks away
from anything.

52:16.857 --> 52:18.125
He won't budge.

52:19.993 --> 52:22.729
- Yeah, I know.
- I need more time.

52:29.703 --> 52:31.573
You don't have the numbers
to overthrow Knuck.

52:33.973 --> 52:35.876
- Maybe I do.
- No, you don't.

52:39.547 --> 52:42.147
And you know why?
Because he is the club.

52:42.149 --> 52:44.752
He is the president
and he is protection.

52:45.652 --> 52:46.884
And you're none of that.

52:46.886 --> 52:48.555
Give me a week
and I'll get it done.

52:50.189 --> 52:52.059
You're not fuckin' listening,
are you, Paddo?

52:53.727 --> 52:55.893
I don't wanna do
business with him.

52:55.895 --> 52:57.663
Because in the end,
he'll just fuck it up

52:57.665 --> 52:59.868
for no other reason other than
the fact that he likes to fight.

53:02.835 --> 53:04.138
But I wanna do
business with you.

53:07.174 --> 53:08.710
My advice?

53:10.009 --> 53:11.777
You take him out.

53:11.779 --> 53:14.312
You'll live with what's left
and you keep building.

53:14.314 --> 53:16.848
Come into business with me and
you'll make more legitimate money

53:16.850 --> 53:18.620
than you've ever made
in your fuckin' life.

53:20.721 --> 53:21.756
And if you don't,

53:23.056 --> 53:25.026
I'll kill your brother
by the end of the week.

53:32.065 --> 53:34.102
You kill him, you're
going to have to kill me.

53:36.971 --> 53:38.139
Yeah, I know.

53:51.819 --> 53:52.921
Hey, Web.

53:53.187 --> 53:54.386
Hello.

53:54.388 --> 53:55.823
How you doing?

53:57.091 --> 53:58.123
Yeah, going good.

54:02.395 --> 54:04.131
Hey.

54:11.305 --> 54:12.607
What?

54:14.841 --> 54:16.741
What?

54:16.743 --> 54:18.845
First night out,
you could've come home.

54:20.381 --> 54:22.083
I fell asleep
at the club.

54:28.422 --> 54:29.757
I'm here.

54:30.156 --> 54:31.158
Hmm?

54:40.701 --> 54:42.333
What are you doing?

54:42.335 --> 54:44.171
What the fuck does it
feel like I'm doing?

54:45.705 --> 54:47.140
- Something like that.
- Yeah?

54:48.676 --> 54:50.875
You still have it
when you're hungover.

54:50.877 --> 54:54.279
Stop it, please, Hayley,
just, not, hey...

54:54.281 --> 54:55.650
Stop it.

55:00.219 --> 55:02.187
Maybe you just
getting old, eh?

55:05.192 --> 55:07.996
Maybe it's you getting old?

55:09.730 --> 55:11.332
Maybe I don't wanna
stick it in you.

55:14.801 --> 55:15.902
You're a cunt.

55:34.855 --> 55:35.857
Hayley.

55:37.056 --> 55:40.025
Hayley! Hayley!

55:40.027 --> 55:42.030
Hayley, you know
I didn't fuckin' mean that.

55:51.337 --> 55:52.339
Mark.

55:54.408 --> 55:55.877
Mark.

55:57.243 --> 55:58.946
Hey, Mark.

56:09.223 --> 56:10.692
What did he say?

56:12.091 --> 56:13.727
He said to kill Knuck.

56:20.134 --> 56:21.269
Rebuild.

56:23.069 --> 56:24.205
Take control.

56:26.939 --> 56:28.175
Go into
business with him.

56:31.544 --> 56:33.280
And Skink's okay.

56:35.381 --> 56:36.717
So just do it,

56:37.384 --> 56:38.953
if that's
the only way.

56:44.091 --> 56:45.727
Well, we'll do
what we talked about.

56:51.330 --> 56:52.265
Run?

56:53.065 --> 56:54.268
It's not running.

56:57.404 --> 56:58.773
I don't need this.

57:03.310 --> 57:05.911
I kill Knuck,

57:05.913 --> 57:07.978
ten years later, in the end,
it doesn't fuckin' matter,

57:07.980 --> 57:09.249
someone kills me,

57:10.082 --> 57:11.151
Skink,

57:13.419 --> 57:14.821
or you.

57:19.459 --> 57:20.060
Kill him.

57:22.094 --> 57:23.297
Save your brother.

57:59.366 --> 58:00.301
Can I sit down?

58:24.424 --> 58:25.359
Where'd you get this?

58:26.359 --> 58:27.828
Dad's stuff.

58:28.462 --> 58:30.164
It's me bookmark.

58:45.344 --> 58:46.544
We'll be all right, eh?

58:46.546 --> 58:48.513
Yeah.

58:48.515 --> 58:50.015
Always have been,
haven't we?

58:50.017 --> 58:51.118
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

58:56.455 --> 58:57.457
Knuck.

59:12.605 --> 59:13.940
That your choice?

59:18.111 --> 59:19.446
I choose my brother.

59:21.547 --> 59:23.315
You're out as well then.

59:23.317 --> 59:25.616
No, he's not
gonna survive by himself.

59:25.618 --> 59:27.454
He's your fuckin'
brother too.

59:28.555 --> 59:30.524
He's a brother to
every single one of ya.

59:35.594 --> 59:37.230
Did you tell the men
what you've turned down?

59:41.100 --> 59:42.102
Your brothers?

59:42.435 --> 59:44.335
Money.

59:44.337 --> 59:47.004
Hundreds of thousands.

59:47.006 --> 59:50.141
A chance for every one
in the club to share in it.

59:50.143 --> 59:51.379
To build something
legitimate.

59:54.580 --> 59:56.413
Something that Jacks
can't touch,

59:56.415 --> 59:57.984
but you didn't want that,
did you, Knuck?

59:58.484 --> 59:59.285
No.

01:00:02.756 --> 01:00:04.458
You've been like
a fuckin' father to me.

01:00:09.296 --> 01:00:10.931
You're a dumb cunt,
Knuck.

01:00:13.299 --> 01:00:15.533
You know what your fuckin'
problem is, do you?

01:00:15.535 --> 01:00:16.469
Tell me.

01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:19.372
You're not fucking real.

01:00:20.172 --> 01:00:21.308
You're a fake.

01:00:23.343 --> 01:00:26.176
You like all this, you like
the leather, you like the ink.

01:00:26.178 --> 01:00:28.480
You like the motorbikes.

01:00:28.482 --> 01:00:31.686
Then you might as well
be a male model or a fag.

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:35.355
Yeah, you're right, Knuck.

01:00:38.058 --> 01:00:39.493
Maybe I am a fake.

01:00:44.297 --> 01:00:45.433
We've all got
our secrets.

01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:51.138
Don't we?

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:54.241
Don't we?

01:01:01.515 --> 01:01:02.614
Knuck, fuck you.

01:01:06.652 --> 01:01:08.353
Take your fuckin' hands
off him.

01:01:08.355 --> 01:01:09.487
Put the fuckin' gun down
before I shove it up your arse!

01:01:09.489 --> 01:01:11.623
Shut the fuck up,
you black cunt!

01:01:11.625 --> 01:01:13.661
I'm the fucking president.
Me.

01:01:14.593 --> 01:01:17.194
You understand?
Knuck!

01:01:17.196 --> 01:01:18.562
You're with me
or you're not.

01:01:18.564 --> 01:01:20.265
It's okay, it's okay.

01:01:20.267 --> 01:01:21.268
It's okay.

01:01:38.819 --> 01:01:40.652
- Fuckin' pussy.
- Fuck off.

01:02:05.212 --> 01:02:08.612
- Fuck Knuck.
- Fuck him.

01:02:15.888 --> 01:02:17.290
Fuck Knuck!

01:02:18.457 --> 01:02:20.493
I want sluts. Ah!

01:02:23.497 --> 01:02:26.163
Oi, what's this shit? What the
fuck happened to your face?

01:02:27.634 --> 01:02:29.433
What happened to you?

01:02:29.435 --> 01:02:31.301
Knuck did it,
he threw him out.

01:02:31.303 --> 01:02:33.139
No, Knuck...
He didn't throw me out.

01:02:35.442 --> 01:02:36.677
Well, if...

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:41.181
You're out.

01:02:42.781 --> 01:02:44.181
Get the fuck!

01:02:44.183 --> 01:02:45.650
- What?
- What the fuck...

01:02:47.786 --> 01:02:49.589
Hey, hey, hey.

01:02:50.623 --> 01:02:51.755
Fuck!

01:02:51.757 --> 01:02:53.290
Everyone
get the fuck out now.

01:02:53.292 --> 01:02:54.561
Everyone get
the fuck out!

01:02:55.328 --> 01:02:56.363
Now!

01:03:20.719 --> 01:03:21.788
Hey.

01:03:23.522 --> 01:03:25.556
He's made up his mind,
there's nothing I can do.

01:03:25.558 --> 01:03:26.790
Yeah, well, Mark didn't
do anything wrong.

01:03:26.792 --> 01:03:28.659
Yeah, but he chose.

01:03:28.661 --> 01:03:29.663
It's his brother.

01:03:30.864 --> 01:03:32.629
Yeah.

01:03:32.631 --> 01:03:35.533
A simpleton who can't
keep out of trouble,

01:03:35.535 --> 01:03:36.833
and you know what?
Fuck Paddo.

01:03:36.835 --> 01:03:38.872
Knuck has done everything
for him.

01:03:41.308 --> 01:03:43.177
You really believe
that, don't you?

01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:46.412
I know that.

01:03:47.846 --> 01:03:49.649
I thought you were smart.

01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:52.719
He fucks around
on you Hayls,

01:03:54.254 --> 01:03:55.420
with men.

01:03:55.422 --> 01:03:57.190
Oh, yeah?

01:03:58.424 --> 01:03:59.857
Yeah.

01:03:59.859 --> 01:04:01.558
- You're pathetic.
- It's true.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.562
Is it?

01:04:04.698 --> 01:04:06.897
All you wanna be
is me.

01:04:06.899 --> 01:04:09.701
I've seen it in
your crazy fuckin' eyes.

01:04:09.703 --> 01:04:10.835
Be you?

01:04:10.837 --> 01:04:11.703
Yeah.

01:04:11.705 --> 01:04:13.340
You got nothing I want.

01:04:13.839 --> 01:04:15.341
I got Knuck.

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:18.579
And I got the clubhouse.

01:04:20.346 --> 01:04:22.779
You go in there,

01:04:22.781 --> 01:04:25.185
and I'll have your
fucking teeth kicked in.

01:04:27.254 --> 01:04:28.620
Now, fuck off.

01:04:28.622 --> 01:04:29.690
Okay.

01:04:46.872 --> 01:04:48.875
Here, Knuck asked me
to get it for you.

01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:51.275
Hey.

01:04:51.277 --> 01:04:52.312
What are you doing here?

01:04:53.013 --> 01:04:54.411
Huh?

01:04:54.413 --> 01:04:55.616
Shouldn't you be
with Paddo?

01:05:58.444 --> 01:05:59.513
She's hot.

01:06:01.647 --> 01:06:02.815
Yeah.

01:06:16.395 --> 01:06:18.698
I spoke to Mark, he
made a deal with Sugar.

01:06:22.736 --> 01:06:23.837
What deal?

01:06:24.904 --> 01:06:27.841
Hmm, doesn't matter,
'cause

01:06:28.975 --> 01:06:30.477
he's not gonna take it.

01:06:34.013 --> 01:06:35.815
So we're gonna
have to move.

01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:39.716
Mmm, go
on the run actually.

01:06:39.718 --> 01:06:40.884
Why?

01:06:40.886 --> 01:06:42.589
Where are we gonna go?

01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:45.025
I don't know.

01:06:48.761 --> 01:06:52.129
Everything he's worked so hard for, just....

01:06:52.131 --> 01:06:53.433
Gone.

01:06:56.703 --> 01:06:59.540
And we'll be looking over our
shoulder forever, you know why?

01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:04.410
Because you mucked up.

01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:06.079
Adam.

01:07:07.013 --> 01:07:08.415
Again.

01:07:15.422 --> 01:07:18.688
It's not all your fault, Knuck
shouldn't have kicked him out.

01:07:18.690 --> 01:07:20.460
He didn't do anything
wrong, did he?

01:07:23.163 --> 01:07:24.598
You did.

01:07:26.031 --> 01:07:27.468
Adam.

01:07:29.067 --> 01:07:30.370
Look at me.

01:07:32.439 --> 01:07:35.442
Mark might not love you
anymore after all this mess.

01:09:03.028 --> 01:09:04.031
The fuck are
you doing here?

01:09:10.202 --> 01:09:11.804
I thought Knuck was here.

01:09:14.072 --> 01:09:15.041
No, he's not.

01:09:20.013 --> 01:09:22.078
Is that why you broke in,
so you could shoot him?

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.988
Yes,
but not you, Hayley.

01:09:34.059 --> 01:09:35.761
You need to leave,
Adam.

01:09:37.095 --> 01:09:38.898
Go on, go home.

01:09:42.769 --> 01:09:44.000
You'll tell.

01:09:44.002 --> 01:09:45.104
No.

01:09:46.171 --> 01:09:47.006
I won't.

01:09:49.041 --> 01:09:52.176
I can't go home
unless I shoot him.

01:09:52.178 --> 01:09:53.777
Get the fuck...

01:10:24.042 --> 01:10:25.011
Kate.

01:10:26.245 --> 01:10:28.047
- You seen Skink?
- Mmm-mmm.

01:10:29.815 --> 01:10:31.050
He's not here?

01:10:33.819 --> 01:10:34.955
Oi.

01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:38.224
Oi, hey.

01:10:42.662 --> 01:10:44.064
Skinky!

01:10:47.899 --> 01:10:49.169
Adam!

01:11:33.312 --> 01:11:35.649
Fuck!

01:11:37.817 --> 01:11:39.720
I just want you
to love me.

01:11:42.154 --> 01:11:44.989
Mark, what's...

01:11:44.991 --> 01:11:46.693
How could you say
those things to him?

01:11:47.894 --> 01:11:49.129
How could you do that?

01:11:49.828 --> 01:11:51.027
To him!

01:11:51.029 --> 01:11:52.228
Well, you weren't
gonna do it.

01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:53.864
I can't fucking do it!

01:11:55.268 --> 01:11:57.834
Well, I'm sorry,
Mark, but he's gone.

01:11:57.836 --> 01:11:59.704
So take charge,
man up.

01:12:02.742 --> 01:12:04.911
He fuckin' shot Hayley.

01:12:31.504 --> 01:12:33.270
Hayley, who?
Who, who, who?

01:12:33.272 --> 01:12:35.039
- Who?
- Where were you?

01:12:35.041 --> 01:12:36.373
Fuck off, cunt!

01:12:36.375 --> 01:12:38.409
Who? Tell me.

01:12:38.411 --> 01:12:40.380
I told you
not to trust him.

01:12:48.888 --> 01:12:51.190
- How many more?
- They're getting here as fast as they can.

01:12:51.924 --> 01:12:53.160
Fuckin'...

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:57.393
Come on, David and Burn,
cover the back door.

01:12:57.395 --> 01:12:59.733
Right! Up against the windows!

01:13:09.442 --> 01:13:11.111
You stay here,
you understand?

01:13:13.246 --> 01:13:14.346
It'll be right, eh?

01:13:22.287 --> 01:13:23.788
Hey, Knuck,
what's going on?

01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:26.156
- Where are your colors?
- In the car.

01:13:26.158 --> 01:13:27.924
- Go get 'em.
- What?

01:13:27.926 --> 01:13:29.196
Go and get 'em!

01:14:13.005 --> 01:14:14.571
I don't wanna do this.

01:14:14.573 --> 01:14:18.010
I don't want.
Please, don't do this.

01:14:20.412 --> 01:14:22.782
- Please don't.
- Get in the fucking car.

01:14:24.617 --> 01:14:26.253
You stay here,
you die!

01:14:30.188 --> 01:14:31.190
Go.

01:14:33.326 --> 01:14:34.327
Fuckin' go!

01:15:16.402 --> 01:15:17.935
They're not coming,
let's just go.

01:15:17.937 --> 01:15:19.168
Fuck up!

01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:20.905
There's not
enough of us, Motu.

01:15:20.907 --> 01:15:22.205
Well, fuck off then, cunt.

01:15:22.207 --> 01:15:23.442
I'm just saying, there's
only fuckin' four of us.

01:15:39.425 --> 01:15:42.128
Fuckin' hell.
Oh, fuck.

01:15:42.428 --> 01:15:44.061
Oh, fuck, no.

01:15:44.063 --> 01:15:45.695
Oh, fuck.

01:15:45.697 --> 01:15:47.563
Oh, fuck!

01:15:47.565 --> 01:15:49.365
No! Fuck!

01:15:49.367 --> 01:15:50.370
Fuck! Fuck!

01:15:53.406 --> 01:15:55.405
Come on, man! We're not a fuckin'...

01:15:55.407 --> 01:15:56.606
...the same.

01:15:56.608 --> 01:15:57.910
Shut the fuck up.

01:16:06.452 --> 01:16:08.584
- Dibs, go around the side.
- This is fuckin' easy for him.

01:16:08.586 --> 01:16:09.522
Motu, go with him.

01:16:10.956 --> 01:16:12.424
Do the fuckin' thing. Fuck.

01:16:53.498 --> 01:16:54.600
Fuck.

01:16:56.602 --> 01:16:58.468
- Fuck.
- What are you doing?

01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:59.570
I can't do it, Motu!

01:16:59.572 --> 01:17:01.137
- You fuck...
- I'm fuckin' out of here.

01:17:01.139 --> 01:17:02.306
Get the fuck...

01:17:02.308 --> 01:17:04.341
What are you fuckin' doing?

01:17:04.343 --> 01:17:05.508
Come back here,

01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:07.147
you fuckin' dog!

01:17:11.384 --> 01:17:13.350
Can we go through?

01:17:13.352 --> 01:17:14.651
All right,
go, go, go, go.

01:17:14.653 --> 01:17:16.556
- Keep on fuckin' moving!
- Okay.

01:17:24.697 --> 01:17:26.032
Fuck.

01:17:30.603 --> 01:17:32.035
Webby, go out
the front door.

01:17:32.037 --> 01:17:33.137
And do what?

01:17:33.139 --> 01:17:34.373
Fuckin' kick it in.

01:17:35.674 --> 01:17:37.477
Psst. Turn around, cunt.

01:17:38.544 --> 01:17:40.244
Shit!

01:17:40.246 --> 01:17:41.547
Fall back, fall in.

01:18:06.639 --> 01:18:09.440
Go, I'll get in the back,
go, go, go.

01:18:09.442 --> 01:18:11.211
Webby, you fuckin' go in,
go, go, go.

01:18:25.558 --> 01:18:27.723
- We're not going anywhere.
- You fuckin' go in!

01:18:27.725 --> 01:18:29.526
We're not
going anywhere.

01:18:29.528 --> 01:18:32.829
- David!
- David, where are you fucking going?

01:18:32.831 --> 01:18:34.530
Come with me,
you fuckin'...

01:18:35.768 --> 01:18:37.601
Where are you going,
you soft cunt?

01:18:37.603 --> 01:18:39.672
Get back here!

01:18:43.142 --> 01:18:45.211
Please, no.

01:18:52.484 --> 01:18:53.883
Go, fucking move!

01:18:53.885 --> 01:18:55.154
- Don't, don't, don't...
- Move!

01:18:56.755 --> 01:18:58.224
Please!

01:18:58.756 --> 01:18:59.722
Go, shoot him!

01:18:59.724 --> 01:19:00.759
Please!

01:19:02.728 --> 01:19:04.393
Fuck, fuck, go.

01:19:04.395 --> 01:19:06.429
Keep movin'.

01:19:06.431 --> 01:19:08.434
Go. Move, move,
move.

01:19:09.635 --> 01:19:11.334
Don't look back, don't
look back, come on.

01:19:11.336 --> 01:19:12.705
Go, go, go.
Fuckin' go.

01:20:29.747 --> 01:20:31.748
Hey, hey,
shut the fuck up.

01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:32.852
Shh.

01:20:57.977 --> 01:20:59.511
Oi, Mark.

01:21:05.416 --> 01:21:07.584
That didn't work out too
good for you, did it?

01:21:07.586 --> 01:21:08.752
Hmm?

01:21:08.754 --> 01:21:09.886
You came to kill me.

01:21:09.888 --> 01:21:10.987
Eh?

01:21:10.989 --> 01:21:12.192
I did.

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:16.262
I didn't mean
to shoot Hayley.

01:21:18.596 --> 01:21:20.632
You sent a fuckin'
half-wit to do it?

01:21:22.635 --> 01:21:23.703
I wanted to

01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:26.902
'cause I don't
like you, Knuck.

01:21:26.904 --> 01:21:30.242
- I fuckin' hate you.
- I don't fuckin' like you either, Adam.

01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:34.314
I fuckin' hate you,
you're a fucker.

01:21:36.915 --> 01:21:38.781
- Brother...
- What's that?

01:21:38.783 --> 01:21:41.951
No, see, David, he can't
go anywhere, can you?

01:21:41.953 --> 01:21:43.887
Right, 'cause he killed
a big, black cunt.

01:21:43.889 --> 01:21:45.489
You see, we're
all in this together.

01:21:45.491 --> 01:21:46.589
Including you.

01:21:46.591 --> 01:21:47.923
Fuck you!

01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:55.335
Markie, Markie,
look at me.

01:21:56.769 --> 01:21:58.302
- Move!
- No.

01:21:58.304 --> 01:21:59.602
Get out of
the fucking way!

01:21:59.604 --> 01:22:01.473
- No.
- Get out of the fuckin' way.

01:22:03.442 --> 01:22:04.874
Get out of the fucking way!

01:22:04.876 --> 01:22:06.578
No! Do it!

01:22:06.879 --> 01:22:08.281
Do it!

01:22:09.982 --> 01:22:13.252
Do it, Knuck.
Do it, do it, do it.

01:22:13.786 --> 01:22:14.921
Shoot me!

01:22:21.327 --> 01:22:23.793
Mark, Mark, Mark.

01:22:23.795 --> 01:22:26.530
No, no, no,
please don't die, Markie.

01:22:26.532 --> 01:22:29.269
Hey, you'll be okay, Mark.

01:22:29.768 --> 01:22:30.737
Mark.

01:22:31.069 --> 01:22:32.535
No.

01:22:32.537 --> 01:22:34.937
No.

01:22:34.939 --> 01:22:36.308
Mark!

01:22:36.774 --> 01:22:38.107
Markie.

01:22:38.109 --> 01:22:39.910
Markie, look at me.

01:22:39.912 --> 01:22:42.111
You'll be all right,
Markie.

01:23:05.703 --> 01:23:06.839
You'll be right.

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.410
We'll be right, Mark.

01:23:16.814 --> 01:23:17.817
Hey.

01:23:19.417 --> 01:23:20.752
Hey.

01:23:34.767 --> 01:23:35.968
Hey, Mark.

01:23:39.404 --> 01:23:40.706
We'll be right.

01:23:44.977 --> 01:23:46.379
Mmm.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.002
You look good.

01:26:30.841 --> 01:26:31.844
Does that hurt?

01:26:34.045 --> 01:26:36.081
Must've started in here,
did it?

01:26:37.349 --> 01:26:40.049
Where you got
the taste?

01:26:40.051 --> 01:26:42.988
You think me fucking someone
like what, makes me what,

01:26:43.889 --> 01:26:45.558
a fuckin' fag?

01:26:49.193 --> 01:26:51.062
Not a fucking faggot.

01:26:53.764 --> 01:26:55.901
You see, in here
or out there...

01:26:58.604 --> 01:27:00.139
It makes me a king.

01:27:03.774 --> 01:27:06.711
You tell yourself whatever
you need to, I don't care.

01:27:07.245 --> 01:27:09.779
I'm done.

01:27:09.781 --> 01:27:11.647
- You're done?
- Yeah.

01:27:11.649 --> 01:27:13.085
Webby's going
to testify.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.089
His sentence
is going to be suspended.

01:27:19.224 --> 01:27:20.589
You're out.

01:27:20.591 --> 01:27:24.263
He's going to be president. Well,
that's what we'll call him anyway.

01:27:25.630 --> 01:27:28.097
But it'll be me pulling
the strings,

01:27:28.099 --> 01:27:29.665
it's my club now,

01:27:29.667 --> 01:27:31.267
it's all you left me.

01:27:37.274 --> 01:27:38.243
It's never gonna happen.

01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:43.282
It's fucking happened.

01:27:52.224 --> 01:27:53.826
Rot in hell.

01:27:56.193 --> 01:27:57.629
Hayley, sit down!

01:27:58.796 --> 01:28:00.295
Hayley!

01:28:00.297 --> 01:28:02.602
- Open up.
- Sit fuckin' back down.

01:28:03.001 --> 01:28:04.668
Hayley.

01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:06.172
Hayley!

01:28:07.171 --> 01:28:09.709
Fuck! Hayley!

01:28:29.728 --> 01:28:30.895
Hey.

01:28:32.163 --> 01:28:33.696
Good thing
you're here.

01:28:33.698 --> 01:28:35.330
You can help me
clean up.

01:28:35.332 --> 01:28:36.700
I want this place
fuckin' spark...
