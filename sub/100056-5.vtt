00:08.095 --> 00:11.011
Okay, Dennis. You ready
for our night float?

00:11.054 --> 00:14.014
Featuring a solo doctor
performance by Carol Kenney?

00:14.057 --> 00:17.626
Yes, yes, your first time
being the only doctor on call.

00:17.669 --> 00:19.019
[sighs]Big night for you,

00:19.062 --> 00:21.108
scary night for our patients.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.371
Dr. Kenney.

00:23.414 --> 00:27.070
Ooh, is that
Dr. Jacobs or Beyoncé?

00:27.114 --> 00:30.160
Before I leave,
I'm legally obligated

00:30.204 --> 00:32.380
to tell you
that if you have any problems,

00:32.423 --> 00:34.904
you can call me
on my one night off.Yes, I know.

00:34.947 --> 00:37.907
I have your number, and I
promise I will call you if...

00:37.950 --> 00:39.735
Let me be clear.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.911
I'm legally obligated

00:41.954 --> 00:45.045
to say that if you have
any problems, you can call me.

00:45.088 --> 00:49.049
On my one... night... off.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.182
Loud and clear.
I am excited to show you

00:52.226 --> 00:55.620
that I am totally capable of
handling this shift by myself.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.231
Not a single call.

00:57.274 --> 00:58.449
How about texts?

00:58.493 --> 01:00.103
Just kidding.

01:00.147 --> 01:02.453
Okay, you have a great--
Okay, bye.

01:02.497 --> 01:04.586
There she is. Nervous?

01:04.629 --> 01:07.241
No, no. I'm excited
for my first night float.

01:07.284 --> 01:09.112
I'm so excited you're doing
the first night float.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.983
Being here alone
and unsupervised?

01:11.027 --> 01:13.769
I'd break down and call
Dr. Jacobs immediately.

01:14.987 --> 01:16.206
I'm sure you're excited now,

01:16.250 --> 01:18.208
but when it's just you
and the linoleum,

01:18.252 --> 01:20.906
and you have to make your first
life-or-death decision?

01:20.950 --> 01:24.084
[laughs]: Yeah, you're gonna
cave and call for help.

01:24.127 --> 01:26.260
Okay. Give me
your patients.

01:26.303 --> 01:27.609
Uh, here are mine.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.741
525 is exhibiting signs
of a lung perforation.

01:29.785 --> 01:31.569
There's a chance
it's gonna collapse,

01:31.613 --> 01:33.571
which might require an
emergency needle thoracostomy.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.095
[gasps]

01:35.138 --> 01:38.663
Ooh. That's a major
procedure, Carol.

01:38.707 --> 01:40.404
Are you sure
you're ready for that?

01:40.448 --> 01:43.277
Why don't you just give up now
and call Dr. Jacobs for help?

01:43.320 --> 01:45.105
Your patients, Daniel?

01:47.281 --> 01:48.456
Aw.

01:48.499 --> 01:49.979
Somebody jealous
that I'm the first intern

01:50.022 --> 01:51.415
to do a night float?

01:51.459 --> 01:52.808
Yes, of course.
Being on a night float

01:52.851 --> 01:54.810
means you get to act
like king of the hospital.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.812
Don't you always act
like king of the hospital?

01:56.855 --> 01:58.814
Not at night.

01:58.857 --> 02:01.599
Good night, Mom. Just
wanted to say good luck.

02:01.643 --> 02:02.687
Aw. Thanks, honey.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.254
So, I'm sure

02:04.298 --> 02:06.996
you young thangs have some
big plans for your night off?

02:07.039 --> 02:08.780
Totally.Huge plans.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.391
Real plans.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.959
Nothing.I could have plans if I wanted.

02:14.003 --> 02:16.353
I'm very lonely.

02:16.397 --> 02:18.355
Aw, come on.

02:18.399 --> 02:21.445
Oh, Jenny, can you take them out
for a drink or something?

02:21.489 --> 02:25.493
Sure, now that you've asked
me in front of everyone.

02:25.536 --> 02:28.626
[chuckles] It's been so long
since we could do anything

02:28.670 --> 02:32.500
except go home, sleep for three
hours, cry and then come back.

02:33.675 --> 02:36.199
Should we go to a bar?

02:36.243 --> 02:38.506
A bar. I remember bars.

02:38.549 --> 02:40.160
I miss bars.

02:40.203 --> 02:41.204
Well, that settles it.
Let's go.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.466
Happy night float, Mom.

02:42.510 --> 02:44.860
Okay. Good night.

02:49.038 --> 02:50.213
There's nothing happening yet.

02:50.257 --> 02:53.564
Cool. Cool.

a little you and me time? Hmm?

You know,

03:21.331 --> 03:22.724
usually, I prefer
the night shift.

03:22.767 --> 03:24.421
Less people, less talk.

03:24.465 --> 03:28.556
But somehow tonight,
there's less people, more talk.

03:28.599 --> 03:30.558
Okay, okay. I get it.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.386
I also like to be alone
with my thoughts

03:32.429 --> 03:34.823
and not have to deal
with other people rambling on.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.390
My mother is like that.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.435
She's always telling me stories
about her friends.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.655
People I don't even know.
But she does have

03:40.698 --> 03:43.266
this one friend, Linda,
who is such a character.

Room 506's
oxygen saturation

03:46.443 --> 03:48.576
is dropping.
How do you want to proceed?

03:48.619 --> 03:51.100
Oh, boy. That's a lot
of fluid around his lung.

03:51.143 --> 03:52.667
I mean, we could monitor it,

03:52.710 --> 03:56.148
but I'm worried about
respiratory failure, so...

03:56.192 --> 03:59.064
[sighs] My plan of
treatment is a pleural tap.

04:01.066 --> 04:03.504
Or maybe I'm jumping the gun.

04:03.547 --> 04:06.115
Although we don't want
to wait too long, so...

04:06.158 --> 04:08.291
Yeah, pleural tap.
Easy decision.

04:08.335 --> 04:09.771
Easy life-or-death decision

04:09.814 --> 04:11.686
that no one's here to
double-check. [chuckles]

04:12.861 --> 04:14.993
So?

04:15.037 --> 04:19.041
So, I know real doctors
don't call,

04:19.084 --> 04:22.436
but maybe we could just check
with Dr. Jacobs just to confirm.

04:22.479 --> 04:25.613
Well, you could, but the last
intern who called Dr. Jacobs

04:25.656 --> 04:28.180
on her night off
ended up in the morgue.

04:30.835 --> 04:33.969
As a doctor or a corpse?

04:34.012 --> 04:36.493
I don't know.
I'm not his mother.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.713
Call Dr. Jacobs.

04:38.756 --> 04:40.802
No. Yes.

Just-- oh,
wait, wait, wait.

Hey. Hi.

Thank goodness
you're still here, Dr. Frost.

04:46.242 --> 04:47.983
Um, just talking it out,

04:48.026 --> 04:50.333
I was thinking about
performing a pleural tap.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.900
Uh, any red flags there?

04:51.943 --> 04:53.989
Ah, I love a pleural tap.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.817
Do you?
Yeah.

04:55.860 --> 04:58.646
Well, great news, because unless
you think it's a terrible idea,

04:58.689 --> 05:00.822
I'm gonna do it
and you're invited.

05:00.865 --> 05:04.391
This is perfect. I had book club
tonight and I didn't read it.

or my apartment,

05:13.269 --> 05:15.271
so I love it.

This is weird. I've only ever
seen you guys in scrubs.

Wait. Are...

Oh, no.Oh, no.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.378
We've never hung out
in the real world.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.293
I didn't realize
you had good taste.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.165
I didn't realize
you had lesbian taste.

05:41.906 --> 05:45.301
Well, it's a good thing we get
practically zero nights off.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.737
There's a low chance
we'll ever go out again

05:46.781 --> 05:49.392
and accidentally reboot
the movie Twins.

05:49.436 --> 05:50.785
BOTH:
DeVito.

05:50.828 --> 05:53.222
Yeah, there's also a low chance

we'll ever feel the touch
of a woman again.

05:56.094 --> 05:58.096
I'm recently single.

05:58.140 --> 06:00.882
Sorry, dude.
And with our schedules,

06:00.925 --> 06:04.407
we probably won't
get laid again forever?

06:04.451 --> 06:06.409
Wait, what are you
guys talking about?

06:06.453 --> 06:07.976
Just use an app.

06:08.019 --> 06:10.718
Here, I can help, I'm a
pro at dating profiles.

06:10.761 --> 06:13.416
That's a no-go. I've been kicked
off of every major dating app

06:13.460 --> 06:15.244
for pretending
to be a CIA recruiter.

06:15.287 --> 06:17.725
Oof. I've already said too much.

06:17.768 --> 06:19.944
There's a pending lawsuit.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.818
Okay. Daniel?

06:23.861 --> 06:26.081
Oh, I don't need help.

06:26.124 --> 06:28.562
I've got this.

06:28.605 --> 06:31.956
Okay. Uh, Caleb,
give me your phone.

Do you know the environmental
toll of a smartphone?

don't have the capacity

06:45.970 --> 06:47.145
to recycle lithium batteries,

Looks like we're gonna meet
people in person tonight.

06:50.888 --> 06:52.847

are y'all drinking?

Okay.

06:58.374 --> 07:01.029
Your pleural tap is done.
Great job, Mr. Murphy.

07:01.072 --> 07:03.335
Excellent work,
Dr. Kenney.

07:03.379 --> 07:06.164
You handle a needle with
the precision of Jascha Heifetz

violin concerto.

Oh, well, thank you.

I can honestly say no one has
ever compared me to that before.

"a young Stockard Channing"
from time to time.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.838
Thank you for joining

Oh, it's my pleasure.

Uh, if it's all right with you,
I might stick around a bit.

07:32.016 --> 07:34.976
All right with me?
Uh, that would be great.Wonderful.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.194
Oh!

07:36.238 --> 07:38.632
I know exactly what
this night float needs.

07:38.675 --> 07:39.807
Is it a secret handshake?

07:39.850 --> 07:41.678
Because I've been
working on one.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.899
[sighs]

07:44.942 --> 07:46.509
Hello, Dennis.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.816
Guess who killed it
on the pleural tap.

07:48.859 --> 07:50.818
You killed someone
with a pleural tap?

07:50.861 --> 07:53.647
What?

07:53.690 --> 07:54.996
No. I-I was great.

07:55.039 --> 07:56.519
We work in a hospital.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.565
Think before you speak, woman.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.654
Look,

08:00.697 --> 08:03.831
the point is, someone
is doing a pretty good job

08:03.874 --> 08:05.528
on her first night float.

08:05.572 --> 08:09.401
They threw me in the deep end,
Dennis, and I am swimming.

08:11.142 --> 08:12.274
Mm-hmm.

08:12.317 --> 08:15.277
"Mm-hmm" what?

08:15.320 --> 08:18.367
I just think someone is
floating with a little help

08:18.410 --> 08:20.543
from Dr. Frost.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.371
I'm the one that did
the pleural tap.

08:22.414 --> 08:23.894
Still cheating.

08:23.938 --> 08:27.463
[gasps] I have never cheated
on anything in my life,

08:27.507 --> 08:28.769
including when
I was chaperoning

08:28.812 --> 08:30.379
the eighth grade trip
to Sacramento,

08:30.422 --> 08:33.600
and Jon Bon Jovi made eyes at me
in the hotel lobby.

08:35.340 --> 08:38.300
[chuckles]: You weren't
gonna hook up with JBJ.

08:39.606 --> 08:42.347
You didn't see the eyes.

08:43.784 --> 08:46.787
And besides,
I-I didn't call Dr. Jacobs.

08:46.830 --> 08:49.877
Well, technically you didn't
call for help, but help is here.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.314
It's not floating
till you float alone.

08:52.357 --> 08:55.578
But you do you, girl.
I ain't judging.

08:57.319 --> 08:59.103
Okay, I am judging.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.806
What happened with the girl
you were talking to?

09:05.849 --> 09:07.764
It was going great until
I realized the guy next to her

09:07.808 --> 09:09.984
was her husband, and that
the shawl over her purse

09:10.027 --> 09:12.464
was actually a blankie
over her baby.

09:14.510 --> 09:17.339
Did he strike out
with the baby mama?You knew?

09:17.382 --> 09:18.906
And did you strike out
with both brunettes

09:18.949 --> 09:20.168
because they're married
to each other?

09:20.211 --> 09:22.605
You knew?[laughs]: I am so good at bars.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.128
I love bars.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.523
At this rate, we're never
gonna find anyone.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.917
I should never have broken up
with Becky after college.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.354
I mean, how bad is a cult,
really?

09:33.703 --> 09:35.313
You just need to
be more efficient.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.793
And you guys are
good at that.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.926
You see, like, a
hundred patients a day.

09:38.969 --> 09:40.101
Yeah. That's it.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.624
Guys, let's just do rounds.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.104
I'll be chief resident,

09:43.147 --> 09:45.280
Jenny will be
the attending. Lexie,

09:45.323 --> 09:47.195
point to a girl
that you like.

09:47.238 --> 09:48.500
Fine.

09:48.544 --> 09:51.155
That one.

09:51.199 --> 09:53.288
Okay.

09:53.331 --> 09:54.942
Female, early 30s,

09:54.985 --> 09:57.640
no visible ring or partner,
presents as single.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.947
Well, I guess
I should go write her

09:59.990 --> 10:02.776
a prescription
for some Lexie-Pro.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.342
[chuckles]

10:04.386 --> 10:07.345
Well, she's exhibiting
some complicating factors.

10:07.389 --> 10:09.565
Her smudged mascara
and her empty drinks indicate

10:09.609 --> 10:11.654
a recent history
of romantic failure.

10:11.698 --> 10:15.005
My diagnosis: not
worth it, dude.

10:15.049 --> 10:16.659
I concur, Dr. Kutcher.

10:16.703 --> 10:19.662
Subject would require
intensive care. Let's move on.

10:19.706 --> 10:22.622
All right, my turn.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.712
That girl.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.365
DANIEL:
20-something female,

10:27.409 --> 10:28.889
presents as single, exhibits

10:28.932 --> 10:31.065
multiple expensive brands.

10:31.108 --> 10:33.502
My diagnosis: subject would
not be cool with a guy

10:33.545 --> 10:35.504
whose phone flips.

10:35.547 --> 10:39.203
Okay, okay. Make some room
for the senior attending.

10:39.247 --> 10:41.423
I've got a girl
for you, Caleb.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.338
That girl in the blue.

10:43.381 --> 10:46.167
She presents as hot.

10:46.210 --> 10:48.343
Complicating factor:
there are four women

10:48.386 --> 10:50.737
at that table,
but only three purses.

10:50.780 --> 10:54.436
So someone stole a purse?

10:54.479 --> 10:55.916
No, no, no, no, no.

10:55.959 --> 10:58.919
I've been collecting data
for years, and I've developed

10:58.962 --> 11:02.357
what I call Lexie's
Lesbian Purse Theory.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.185
Mm, intriguing.

11:04.228 --> 11:05.708
Let us serve
as your peer review.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.580
Mm, you see, if a woman
carries a purse,

11:08.624 --> 11:10.191
she may be straight,
she may be gay.

11:10.234 --> 11:13.455
However, if a woman
does not carry a purse,

11:13.498 --> 11:17.024
99.9% of the time,
she's a lesbian.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.287
So, based on
my research,

11:19.330 --> 11:21.898
if that table has four women
and only three purses,

11:21.942 --> 11:23.857
what might we deduce?

11:23.900 --> 11:26.207
Between one and four of
those women are lesbians.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.035
Exactly.CALEB: Well,

11:28.078 --> 11:30.733
this case may require
some further observation.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.082
Let's go run
some tests.

11:33.954 --> 11:34.998
[sighs]

11:36.652 --> 11:37.958
Every night float
needs...

11:38.001 --> 11:39.394
snacks.Oh.

11:39.437 --> 11:41.483
This will help fuel the
rest of our night float.

11:41.526 --> 11:42.745
All right,
what's up next?

11:42.789 --> 11:45.226
Listen, uh,
we have to talk.

11:45.269 --> 11:47.750
Oh, no. "We
have to talk."

11:47.794 --> 11:49.404
Every time a woman
says that to me,

11:49.447 --> 11:51.275
I end up losing
half my boat.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.804
Now I have... no boat.

11:59.457 --> 12:02.504
Look, I really appreciate
you being there for me,

12:02.547 --> 12:04.332
but if I'm gonna be
a real doctor,

12:04.375 --> 12:06.421
I have to do this
night float on my own.

12:06.464 --> 12:08.902
Having you here
feels like cheating.

12:08.945 --> 12:10.730
I understand.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.558
We had fun, though,
didn't we?

12:14.646 --> 12:17.084
We did.
If I had to night float

12:17.127 --> 12:19.913
with anyone,
it'd be you.
Aw.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.741
We'll always have
pleural tap.

12:23.830 --> 12:27.137
They say if you love
someone, set them free.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.315
Goodbye, snacks.

12:33.143 --> 12:36.016
Good luck, Dr. Kenney.Thank you.

12:36.059 --> 12:39.106
I should get to
sleep anyway.[elevator dings]

12:39.149 --> 12:41.935
Gonna be difficult.
I just drank a Red Bull.Mm.

12:41.978 --> 12:43.806
Oh, well!

12:44.720 --> 12:46.809
Good night.Dr. Kenney!

12:46.853 --> 12:48.942
What is it?It's 525.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.291
His lung
just collapsed.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.858
He's gonna need
a needle thoracostomy,

12:51.901 --> 12:53.816
and Dr. Frost just left.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.513
Well, do you want
to stop him?

12:55.557 --> 12:57.385
Uh...

12:57.428 --> 12:59.300
You better
decide fast.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.345
He has a very good
parking spot.

13:01.389 --> 13:05.175
[sighs]
No. I've got this.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.490
Catheter is placed.

13:17.231 --> 13:21.104
Threading the extension tubing
with a 60cc syringe.

13:21.148 --> 13:22.453
KAREN:
Breathing is improved.

13:22.497 --> 13:24.542
Patient is stabilizing.

13:24.586 --> 13:25.543
And...

13:25.587 --> 13:27.545
we are clear.

13:27.589 --> 13:30.287
All right. Karen, transfer
this patient to the ICU.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.507
Dennis, walk with me.

13:36.511 --> 13:37.773
[exhales]

13:40.167 --> 13:42.125
Question:

13:42.169 --> 13:46.826
did I crush that
or did I nail it?

13:46.869 --> 13:49.829
I-I got to say, you
did all right. Yeah.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.178
And you did it
on your own.

13:51.221 --> 13:53.484
I did. I did
a needle thoracostomy

13:53.528 --> 13:56.879
totally unsupervised. I don't
know what I was worried about.

13:56.923 --> 14:00.230
I got this. Okay,
the training wheels are off,

14:00.274 --> 14:02.885
and the night restarts now.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.713
Good evening, Dennis.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.499
You know what, normally,
I don't like this sort of thing,

14:08.543 --> 14:10.327
but after that?

14:10.371 --> 14:12.721
Good evening, Carol.

14:12.764 --> 14:16.551
And now, it's time
for this night-floater

14:16.594 --> 14:18.248
to swim.

14:22.383 --> 14:25.125
♪

14:44.840 --> 14:46.842
♪

14:56.983 --> 14:59.115
Well, folks, it's still
early in the game,

14:59.159 --> 15:00.900
but it looks like
Lexie's pulling ahead.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.597
Now, Jennifer,
I've got to say,

15:02.640 --> 15:04.077
I think Lexie
could win this match

15:04.120 --> 15:06.644
on the strength
of her outfit alone.

15:08.081 --> 15:11.084
She's got the trappings
of a very hot male doctor.

15:12.781 --> 15:16.219
Oh, looks like Caleb's trying
the "arm stroke" maneuver.

15:16.263 --> 15:18.656
You know, Daniel, I don't think
I've seen flirting this overt

15:18.700 --> 15:20.920
since eighth grade, when
Kevin Singleton said

15:20.963 --> 15:23.052
if we made out,
no one had to know.

15:23.096 --> 15:27.448
Ah. Yes, the "it'll be
our secret" method.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.232
I know it well.

15:29.276 --> 15:31.756
I had to retire that one
from play because it's gross

15:31.800 --> 15:33.323
and bad for my brand.

15:33.367 --> 15:34.934
[chuckles]

15:37.458 --> 15:40.069
Well?It looked like it was going
my way when she was like,

15:40.113 --> 15:43.464
"I'm vegan
and I love hiking."

15:43.507 --> 15:44.987
But then she said
she hated cats,

15:45.031 --> 15:46.641
so who knows what's what.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.949
Wait, so you just
give up?

15:49.992 --> 15:51.776
Would you give up
on a diagnosis?

15:51.820 --> 15:53.343
Not at the hospital.

15:53.387 --> 15:56.433
Well, this is a teaching bar,
and my interns don't bail.

15:56.477 --> 15:59.480
You guys get back in there
and figure it out.

16:00.742 --> 16:01.786
So, uh,

16:01.830 --> 16:03.266
where is
Kevin Singleton now?

16:03.310 --> 16:05.138
He burned down
a Pizza Hut.

16:07.531 --> 16:09.969
Patient is 24.
Admitted for pneumonia,

16:10.012 --> 16:12.101
but has started complaining
about heart palpitations.

16:12.145 --> 16:13.363
I checked her vitals,
and her heart rate

16:13.407 --> 16:14.625
is through the roof.

16:14.669 --> 16:16.497
Oh, yeah. That
is really fast.

16:17.933 --> 16:20.283
Hey, Bree, I'm Dr. Kenney.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.806
Don't worry,
you're in the right place.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.286
Just... just hang tight.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.027
Standard A-fib?Yeah.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.333
Looks like it.
Let's prep a dose

16:26.376 --> 16:29.075
of IV diltiazem,
bring the rate down.

16:32.861 --> 16:35.907
Uh, Dennis?
Just, uh, hold up a second.

16:37.692 --> 16:40.521
I'm worried about this EKG.
Something's off.

16:40.564 --> 16:42.131
I mean, the rate
keeps fluctuating,

16:42.175 --> 16:44.525
and the QRS seems to get wider
as it's speeding up.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.005
That's not typical of A-fib.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.702
So, no meds?

16:47.745 --> 16:51.836
[sighs]
Maybe I should call Dr. Jacobs.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.665
Are you sure?
You've been crushing it.

16:54.709 --> 16:57.059
The night's almost over.I know.
I don't want to,

16:57.103 --> 17:00.062
but... this EKG concerns me.

17:00.106 --> 17:01.977
It's your call.

17:05.763 --> 17:06.938
So?
So?

17:06.982 --> 17:08.549
The tests came back positive

17:08.592 --> 17:10.855
for Lexie.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.379
It's cool, actually.
Her roommate wants me

17:12.422 --> 17:13.597
to go home with her.

17:13.641 --> 17:14.946
Okay.
[chuckles]

17:14.990 --> 17:16.426
Yeah. She wants me to go back
to their place

17:16.470 --> 17:17.775
and look at her rash.

17:17.819 --> 17:20.082
Okay.
Well,

17:20.126 --> 17:21.866
you know,
maybe it'll lead to something.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.433
Depending on where the rash is.

17:26.088 --> 17:29.352
[chuckling]: Well, I'm gonna
declare tonight a win

17:29.396 --> 17:31.920
for the interns.Oh, I don't know.

17:31.963 --> 17:33.269
I feel bad.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.097
We spent so long
helping the others,

17:35.141 --> 17:36.533
we didn't get
around to you.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.100
You didn't get to talk
to anyone you liked.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.929
Yes, I did.

17:45.499 --> 17:48.110
All right, Bree. You're stable
and you're gonna be fine.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.982
Dr. Kenney is right.
We figured out your A-fib

17:51.026 --> 17:52.375
was caused in part by

17:52.419 --> 17:54.116
Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome,

17:54.160 --> 17:56.901
a rare disorder in the
electrical system of the heart.

17:56.945 --> 18:00.079
Our cardiology team will be
coming to evaluate you shortly.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.472
But for now, just rest.

18:05.693 --> 18:08.435
I'm glad you called
me, Dr. Kenney.

18:08.478 --> 18:11.438
Because of the WPW complication,
the standard treatment

18:11.481 --> 18:13.570
for atrial fibrillation
would have killed her.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.877
Oh, I'm so glad to hear that.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.272
I mean, I'm glad
I didn't kill her.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.404
And I'm glad I called you
for a good reason.

18:21.448 --> 18:23.102
So now you won't kill me.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.323
Well, you did the right thing.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.108
Well, I hope I didn't
ruin your whole evening.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.935
Looks like it was fun.Excuse me?

18:30.979 --> 18:32.502
Oh, the stamp
on your hand.

18:32.546 --> 18:34.461
Were you
at a concert?

18:34.504 --> 18:36.115
Oh...

18:36.158 --> 18:39.727
I once met Jon Bon Jovi
in a hotel lobby in Sacramento.

18:50.172 --> 18:53.132
Good morning.Dr. Jacobs is already here.
You called her.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.308
I knew it.
I win. Pay up.

18:55.351 --> 18:58.485
I hate to see my hard-earned
money go to hair gel.

19:01.401 --> 19:04.795
It's okay, Carol.
I would've wussed out, too.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.884
DANIEL:
Yeah, sorry about
your career, Carol.

19:06.928 --> 19:09.191
So, you've burned through
teacher and doctor.

19:09.235 --> 19:12.368
What's next, fun
old lady detective?

19:12.412 --> 19:14.631
Okay, okay. You guys
don't know the half of it.

19:14.675 --> 19:17.634
The half that Dr. Jacobs did?[chuckles]: Oh!

19:17.678 --> 19:19.201
Burn.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.811
Enough!

19:20.855 --> 19:23.162
This woman crushed it tonight.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.293
She saw patient

19:24.337 --> 19:26.730
after patient after patient,

19:26.774 --> 19:29.820
and just as she was about
to finish her first night float

19:29.864 --> 19:31.735
without one single phone call,

19:31.779 --> 19:34.085
she got one
unusual patient.

19:34.129 --> 19:36.000
And she was doctor enough

19:36.044 --> 19:39.526
to put her ego aside
and make the call.

19:39.569 --> 19:43.225
Because that's what
real doctors do.

19:43.269 --> 19:44.661
So don't give her
any crap,

19:44.705 --> 19:47.882
unless you want to deal with me.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.496
Thank you, Dennis.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.933
C+D Music Factory.

19:58.284 --> 20:00.242
I'm out.

20:03.158 --> 20:06.509
Yeah. Sorry, Carol,
I was way out of line.

20:06.553 --> 20:08.424
I don't care about whatever
medical stuff you did.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.557
Whatever you did to Dennis
is way more impressive.

20:12.602 --> 20:15.605
Thanks. You guys look
a little rough.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.259
Big night?

20:17.303 --> 20:20.044
Well, Caleb and Lexie
both went home with ladies.

20:20.088 --> 20:23.047
And we ended up diagnosing
both ladies with ringworm.

20:23.091 --> 20:26.094
Ooh.Also, their dog.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.705
You actually look
pretty good, Daniel.

20:28.749 --> 20:30.141
Anything to report?

20:30.185 --> 20:31.230
Nope.

20:40.021 --> 20:42.241
Hey, Dr. Frost.
I just wanted to

20:42.284 --> 20:44.678
thank you for getting my
night float off to a good start.

20:44.721 --> 20:46.680
Oh! And did you get
the video I sent you?

20:46.723 --> 20:48.290
Oh, yes. And
I practiced.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.465
