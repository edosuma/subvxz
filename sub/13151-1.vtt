00:19.555 --> 00:24.555
You murderers!
It's easy to gun us down! We only got rocks!

00:24.715 --> 00:28.555
H A T E

00:39.235 --> 00:41.675
This film is dedicated to friends and family

00:41.875 --> 00:44.035
who died while it was in the making.

00:47.015 --> 00:50.435
Heard about the guy
who fell off a skyscraper?

00:51.352 --> 00:53.520
On his way down past each floor,

00:53.688 --> 00:56.065
he kept saying to reassure himself:

00:57.024 --> 00:59.025
"So far so good..."

00:59.610 --> 01:01.695
"so far so good..."

01:06.075 --> 01:08.285
How you fall doesn't matter.

01:10.037 --> 01:11.496
It's how you land!

04:44.834 --> 04:48.087
More rioting in the projects outside the city.

04:48.254 --> 04:50.255
Last night a mob of youths

04:50.590 --> 04:54.885
attacked a police station
in the Muguet projects.

04:55.052 --> 04:58.054
Pitched battles left 14 officers injured.

04:58.222 --> 05:00.015
33 arrests were made.

05:00.183 --> 05:03.853
A mall and nearby buildings
were damaged by looters

05:04.395 --> 05:06.396
who dispersed around 4 a.m.

05:06.564 --> 05:10.484
Alleged police brutality
sparked the riots 2 days ago.

05:10.693 --> 05:14.446
A local teen was severely beaten
under questioning.

05:14.655 --> 05:16.239
The officer was suspended.

05:16.657 --> 05:20.410
The victim, Abdel Ichaha, is in hospital

05:20.619 --> 05:22.370
in critical condition.

06:03.120 --> 06:06.581
Got a looter under arrest, a minor.

06:32.024 --> 06:34.985
SAYID: FUCK THE POLICE

06:41.199 --> 06:44.201
Vinz! Where the fuck is he?

06:44.786 --> 06:46.704
What?
- Whadda ya mean "what"?

06:46.872 --> 06:48.707
Can't fuckin' say hello?

06:48.874 --> 06:50.792
Chill, Sayid. What's up?

06:50.959 --> 06:52.877
Tell your bro to come out.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.213
What for?
- Tell him!

06:55.380 --> 06:57.757
What for?
- Just tell him!

06:57.924 --> 06:59.342
What for?

07:00.010 --> 07:01.594
Is this a TV game show?

07:01.762 --> 07:04.306
Quit hollering!

07:04.514 --> 07:08.100
You guys made enough noise last night!

07:08.560 --> 07:11.396
You see me last night? I wasn't here.

07:11.563 --> 07:12.647
Shut up!

07:12.856 --> 07:14.482
Don't play dumb!

07:14.649 --> 07:16.942
You'll burn next, asshole!
- Idiot!

07:18.028 --> 07:20.822
You gonna get him?
- Don't asshole me, asshole!

07:20.989 --> 07:23.282
You still there? Beat it!

07:23.950 --> 07:26.827
If I wake him, he'll get mad. You try!

07:26.995 --> 07:29.455
I hope the cops tan your hide!

07:45.346 --> 07:46.680
Vinz...

07:48.725 --> 07:49.809
Shut up, Sayid.

07:50.018 --> 07:54.105
Shut up? Be nice or you're history, fuckface!

07:54.272 --> 07:56.649
Go away. You stink!

07:57.150 --> 07:59.819
You want to play this early? One...

07:59.986 --> 08:00.778
Two...

08:00.945 --> 08:02.112
Three.

08:03.114 --> 08:04.114
You lose.

08:04.324 --> 08:05.825
Fuck your sister.

08:05.992 --> 08:08.744
I told you not to talk about her!

08:08.912 --> 08:11.039
She sucks Donald Duck. Get lost!

08:11.247 --> 08:11.914
Jew boy!

08:12.081 --> 08:15.501
You bogus kike, you're nowhere!

08:16.002 --> 08:17.920
I saw a cow.
- What?

08:18.087 --> 08:19.004
A cow.

08:19.172 --> 08:20.256
Got some smoke?

08:20.465 --> 08:21.883
In the box.

08:24.844 --> 08:29.348
Last night, during the riot,
I dashed behind a building:

08:29.515 --> 08:32.142
Wham! I ran right into a cow.

08:32.393 --> 08:33.393
Really?

08:33.686 --> 08:35.979
Stop smoking, your brain's fried!

08:36.188 --> 08:38.566
Off my bed! I'll say you're taking drugs!

08:38.775 --> 08:41.235
I'll cut your throat, hang you up,

08:41.402 --> 08:44.113
you'll drown in your blood!

08:44.280 --> 08:45.239
Granma!

08:47.283 --> 08:48.826
Get off the bed.

08:49.619 --> 08:50.619
You get out.

08:50.786 --> 08:51.953
Stay off my bed!

08:53.456 --> 08:55.583
Get lost, you snitch!

08:55.750 --> 08:57.668
Move it.

08:57.835 --> 09:00.045
Watch your mouth with my sister!
You'll skip temple!

09:00.212 --> 09:02.589
Got any salt?
- Respect your granma!

09:02.757 --> 09:03.924
You my father?

09:04.091 --> 09:05.342
What about Dad?

09:05.509 --> 09:08.178
You my mother now?

09:09.013 --> 09:10.264
Go to school!

09:10.431 --> 09:12.266
It burned down.

09:12.433 --> 09:14.351
Burned down! Savages!

09:14.518 --> 09:18.021
Start that way and soon you'll skip temple!

09:18.189 --> 09:20.107
Granma!
- What?

09:20.274 --> 09:21.441
I didn't burn the school!

09:21.650 --> 09:24.486
And you don't go to temple!

09:24.653 --> 09:26.780
You win! I surrender!

09:26.989 --> 09:29.449
If everyone ran from an argument,

09:29.617 --> 09:31.702
there'd be a stampede, already!

09:31.869 --> 09:34.621
But we'd all be going the same way!

09:34.872 --> 09:36.039
Mazeltov!

09:36.373 --> 09:38.083
You talkin' to me?

09:56.101 --> 10:00.021
You talkin' to me, mothafucka!

10:10.240 --> 10:14.243
...the guy says: "For cash, I'd even murder!"

10:14.411 --> 10:17.789
He tells his friend: "I'd even waste you."

10:17.956 --> 10:20.083
The friend freaks, so the guy says:

10:20.250 --> 10:22.794
"Don't worry, you're a buddy.

10:23.003 --> 10:26.673
"I won't waste you for cash,
I'll do it for free!"

10:26.840 --> 10:29.217
What a killer line! "For free!"

10:29.426 --> 10:33.012
"I'll waste you for free!" What a line, Vinz!

10:33.180 --> 10:34.264
I got it the first time.

10:34.431 --> 10:37.267
Tell your brother to come see me!

10:37.434 --> 10:41.271
What a killer put-down!
"I'll waste you for free!"

10:41.480 --> 10:43.607
Shut up and gimme the joint.

10:47.652 --> 10:49.487
A killer line!
- Killer.

10:49.654 --> 10:54.784
"I'd waste you for free."
Can't do better than that!

10:57.370 --> 10:59.413
Why you so uptight?

11:04.211 --> 11:06.338
Mothafucka!

11:09.216 --> 11:11.927
Bastards wrecked everything!

11:15.680 --> 11:16.931
Check that!

11:22.187 --> 11:24.397
I don't believe it!

11:26.107 --> 11:28.317
How'd they get the car in?

11:28.485 --> 11:31.738
The doorway's too narrow.

11:32.947 --> 11:35.157
Chill, Sayid! There he is.

11:35.658 --> 11:37.910
He must be pissed off.

11:38.078 --> 11:41.247
Took him two years to get this gym!

11:57.889 --> 12:00.016
Your dope's good, Vinz.

12:01.267 --> 12:03.394
Not mine. It's Hubert's.

12:08.566 --> 12:10.609
Don't bogart, Sayid.

12:10.777 --> 12:12.445
Thought you quit smoking?

12:12.612 --> 12:14.030
Me too.

12:16.199 --> 12:18.200
What happened here?

12:18.368 --> 12:19.702
Guess.

12:19.952 --> 12:21.411
A fire?

12:22.622 --> 12:25.082
You win the prize, Einstein!

12:25.708 --> 12:26.750
Kiss mine, cousin!

12:26.918 --> 12:29.378
I knew it'd go up in smoke one day.

12:29.545 --> 12:31.922
So why'd you bust ass to get it?

12:32.131 --> 12:34.216
'Cause he wanted to, dickface!

12:34.383 --> 12:35.634
You're the dick.

12:35.802 --> 12:37.512
You know who did it?

12:37.720 --> 12:39.471
I don't want to know.

12:41.557 --> 12:43.392
How'd the car get in here?

12:43.935 --> 12:46.228
The doorway's not big enough.

12:54.028 --> 12:56.780
We dissed them, spit on them!

12:56.948 --> 12:59.659
But the cops didn't move an inch.

12:59.825 --> 13:03.954
Then the mothers stepped aside
to make a path...

13:10.211 --> 13:14.882
Then these plainclothes pigs
came out with wooden clubs.

13:15.049 --> 13:18.051
They hit a homeboy, like real bad!

13:18.219 --> 13:21.013
Kept clubbing him till we tore into 'em.

13:21.180 --> 13:24.600
I kicked a pig right in the head!

13:35.611 --> 13:36.778
That's a Yamaha.

13:37.279 --> 13:39.572
More like your Mom on a Harley!

13:39.740 --> 13:42.492
It's Mohammed's bike. He fixed the exhaust.

13:42.660 --> 13:45.204
No, it's Vinz's Mom on a Yamaha!

13:45.412 --> 13:46.830
Which Mohammed?

13:48.207 --> 13:49.666
Farida's brother?

13:49.833 --> 13:51.918
Farida with the driver's licence?

13:52.086 --> 13:54.296
No, Farida from the supermarket.

13:56.131 --> 13:58.049
Anyway, it was a scene.

13:58.217 --> 14:02.346
You should've been there Hubert.
It was intense.

14:03.680 --> 14:06.140
Tear gas, 2 nights in a cop shop,

14:06.350 --> 14:08.101
all the fists you can eat,

14:08.268 --> 14:10.019
getting hell at home:

14:10.187 --> 14:13.773
"Sorry cousin, but I ain't buyin'!"

14:14.608 --> 14:19.654
Gimme a break!
It was war against the pigs, in living color!

14:19.863 --> 14:23.074
I was trying to make some cash.

14:23.242 --> 14:25.911
Your bogus riot fucked it up!

14:26.954 --> 14:29.748
When a brother goes down, I stand up!

14:30.248 --> 14:33.292
What brother? Do I know the guy?

14:33.502 --> 14:38.340
I won't take hits for a homeboy gangsta I don't know.

14:41.551 --> 14:42.718
Let's go.

14:43.637 --> 14:45.096
I mean it!

14:45.263 --> 14:46.973
Abdel's no gangsta.

14:47.140 --> 14:50.977
OK, but I'm not faster than a speeding bullet!

14:57.275 --> 14:59.652
Hey, hands off the hot dogs!

14:59.861 --> 15:00.861
Gimme one.

15:01.071 --> 15:02.322
And go broke?

15:02.489 --> 15:03.948
Don't make us cry!

15:04.115 --> 15:06.826
I'll make you cry, Sayid!

15:07.118 --> 15:09.078
Everyone pays the same!

15:09.246 --> 15:11.539
Except Hubert, it's his building.

15:11.706 --> 15:12.706
A buck?

15:12.874 --> 15:14.917
A buck for one, OK two!

15:16.461 --> 15:18.045
You're a drag!

15:18.213 --> 15:19.589
You should try one.

15:19.756 --> 15:21.966
Got a buck?
- Yeah, for me!

15:22.175 --> 15:22.842
Here.

15:23.009 --> 15:26.262
No way, I'll remember this!

15:26.429 --> 15:28.180
So remember.
- Never forget.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.477
Don't be a jerk. I'll pay later.

15:34.104 --> 15:36.731
How? With your sister?

15:36.898 --> 15:39.233
Don't talk that way about her!

15:39.400 --> 15:41.568
Chill out, you bogus Arab!

15:41.736 --> 15:44.822
Sayid! Come back with that!

15:52.038 --> 15:53.289
Got any change?

15:53.498 --> 15:55.750
We're broke!

15:56.376 --> 15:58.252
2 bits.
- We're broke.

15:58.753 --> 16:01.589
...The judge says I go to jail,

16:01.756 --> 16:03.549
or do jobs for the City.

16:03.716 --> 16:06.009
Community service? The pits!

16:06.219 --> 16:09.180
Ever do it? Jail's bad enough!

16:09.347 --> 16:11.182
You'd rather do time?

16:11.474 --> 16:13.058
Your bro stole a dog!

16:13.226 --> 16:15.519
Liar!
- His mouth is full!

16:15.728 --> 16:17.146
Put it on my tab.

16:17.313 --> 16:19.189
Liar! Your nose is growing!

16:19.982 --> 16:21.858
I'll bust your nose, Sayid!

16:23.653 --> 16:24.904
Beat it!

16:36.832 --> 16:38.500
A.45!

16:39.460 --> 16:41.420
Like the gun in "Lethal Weapon."

16:41.587 --> 16:45.632
We saw that movie together!
It was a 9mm. Glock!

16:46.133 --> 16:48.134
What?
- No, it wasn't!

16:48.302 --> 16:50.429
That was a Desert Eagle.

16:52.807 --> 16:54.475
He shot at the truck!

16:54.642 --> 16:56.894
That wasn't "Lethal Weapon"!

16:57.353 --> 17:00.314
What are you talking about?

17:02.733 --> 17:05.652
A cop lost his handgun during the riot.

17:05.819 --> 17:07.445
That's a good one!

17:07.613 --> 17:12.159
I don't know the pig who lost his piece.

17:12.492 --> 17:15.454
But I'd like to know who found it!

17:16.163 --> 17:17.247
No joke!

17:21.585 --> 17:24.546
...I'll sleep, eat, lift weights.

17:24.713 --> 17:27.257
Everyone's been inside, except me.

17:28.217 --> 17:30.677
A month for theft is pathetic!

17:31.262 --> 17:32.346
Not in your league!

17:32.554 --> 17:36.557
What league? I was never inside!
- You got nabbed.

17:37.726 --> 17:38.726
I quit in time!

17:39.979 --> 17:40.854
Come look!

17:41.021 --> 17:42.856
We got visitors.

17:43.023 --> 17:45.150
Over here!

17:45.442 --> 17:47.652
It's the mayor!

17:47.903 --> 17:52.073
Up Your Honor, Mr. Mayor! Mothafucka!

17:55.160 --> 17:56.911
Cut the stereo!

17:57.079 --> 18:00.916
Who's in charge here? You, Nordeen?

18:01.959 --> 18:03.960
What's going on here?

18:04.127 --> 18:06.379
Think you're in Disneyland?

18:06.547 --> 18:09.800
You're not allowed up here.
You gotta go down.

18:09.967 --> 18:11.218
We're causing no trouble.

18:11.426 --> 18:15.429
Still, you've got to get off the roof.

18:15.597 --> 18:17.223
We like it up here.

18:17.391 --> 18:18.642
Off the roof.

18:19.393 --> 18:22.896
You learn that shit at Notre Dame?

18:25.190 --> 18:28.026
Cut it out! Quiet everyone!

18:31.279 --> 18:34.657
I'll handle this!
- Forget it!

18:34.866 --> 18:36.784
You can't stay here!

18:37.452 --> 18:40.830
So fold your little tents, grab your chairs...

18:40.997 --> 18:43.791
and let's all go downstairs nice and easy.

18:44.209 --> 18:44.792
OK!

18:44.960 --> 18:47.087
Who's gonna make us leave?

18:47.295 --> 18:50.423
Your goons or you, in your little uniform?

18:50.590 --> 18:52.883
Nordeen, we're doing our job.

18:56.263 --> 18:57.847
Leave us alone!

19:00.308 --> 19:03.394
Don't talk to me like that, I don't know you.

19:03.561 --> 19:04.561
Now get lost!

19:04.729 --> 19:06.063
Sitting duck!

19:06.231 --> 19:08.358
Your mother drinks Bud!

19:15.532 --> 19:18.868
Anyone who wants to stay, stay! Heat's off.

19:19.035 --> 19:21.871
I'm staying.
- You're going.

19:22.038 --> 19:23.998
Let me stay, Nordeen.

19:24.165 --> 19:26.292
What did I say?
- You said go.

19:26.501 --> 19:28.461
So what do you do?
- I go!

19:29.838 --> 19:31.839
OK, I'm going!

19:32.006 --> 19:33.966
Vinz, c'mon!

19:35.552 --> 19:37.303
Don't play tough guy!

19:37.470 --> 19:39.805
You always wimp out!

19:58.741 --> 20:00.409
...You see 'em in porn stores.

20:00.576 --> 20:01.994
What are they called?

20:02.161 --> 20:03.328
G-strings.

20:03.496 --> 20:05.206
What?
- G-strings, moron.

20:05.373 --> 20:07.917
She had one on, I swear it.

20:08.084 --> 20:09.835
I fucked her like an animal.

20:10.002 --> 20:12.087
We were in the room...

20:14.006 --> 20:16.758
she kept screaming for more.

20:16.926 --> 20:20.512
Guy next door pounded
the wall we were so noisy.

20:21.347 --> 20:24.016
You dreamt you fucked her!

20:24.392 --> 20:26.310
What?

20:26.561 --> 20:29.272
You know the bitch?
- I know her, she has AIDS.

20:29.438 --> 20:32.107
Get outta here!

20:32.358 --> 20:34.651
Hi, we're from TV.
- What's this?

20:34.819 --> 20:36.904
Were you in the riot last night?

20:37.071 --> 20:38.655
Did you break things, burn cars?

20:38.823 --> 20:42.409
We look like looters, lady?
- I didn't say that.

20:42.576 --> 20:44.786
So what do we look like?
- Nothing special.

20:44.954 --> 20:47.706
Get out the car! This ain't Thoiry.

20:47.999 --> 20:49.583
We got work to do.

20:49.750 --> 20:53.295
What kind of work?
Stirring up shit?

20:53.546 --> 20:55.631
For a juicy scoop!
- No camera!

20:56.674 --> 21:00.010
Quit snooping in the 'hood,
fuckface! Stop taping!

21:00.845 --> 21:02.555
Quit taping, dickhead!

21:03.639 --> 21:04.973
This ain't Thoiry!

21:07.560 --> 21:09.645
What's with all the assholes today?

21:09.812 --> 21:12.606
That fuckin' broad...

21:16.193 --> 21:17.360
What's Thoiry?

21:17.570 --> 21:19.863
A drive-in safari park.

21:21.282 --> 21:22.950
This ain't no zoo!

21:24.368 --> 21:26.369
Open up, WalMart!

21:28.539 --> 21:29.539
You fuckin' jerks.

21:29.707 --> 21:31.917
Talk nice, we're in France.

21:34.169 --> 21:36.629
It's 1 p.m. And you're in bed?

21:39.550 --> 21:41.760
What's with the hair net?

21:42.136 --> 21:43.846
Lay off!

21:44.555 --> 21:46.848
You a movie star, WalMart?

21:47.516 --> 21:48.683
What's this shitty TV?

21:48.851 --> 21:50.602
Watch where you sit!

21:50.769 --> 21:52.103
Just sweat pants!

21:52.271 --> 21:54.982
Where's the new TV?

21:55.149 --> 21:56.316
It's too big to move.

21:56.525 --> 21:59.694
I came by for my cash. Where were you?

21:59.862 --> 22:02.906
I don't have it.

22:03.073 --> 22:05.283
Don't you know what happened?

22:06.118 --> 22:09.871
Go see what your pals did.

22:16.878 --> 22:19.797
Foued's brother did that.

22:20.215 --> 22:20.882
So what?

22:21.049 --> 22:23.092
Give me his address.

22:23.260 --> 22:26.638
Look what he did to my car!

22:26.805 --> 22:28.640
Look what he did!

22:28.807 --> 22:31.100
Just look!

22:31.268 --> 22:33.269
Leave that alone.

22:33.437 --> 22:37.691
I lost ten grand! I can't work now.

22:37.858 --> 22:40.819
WalMart, it's just a car!

22:42.070 --> 22:44.155
That's what you say!

22:44.322 --> 22:46.157
You don't realize.

22:46.324 --> 22:48.451
It's all I got.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.578
Cut it out!

22:50.829 --> 22:51.829
Leave that alone!

22:52.038 --> 22:53.789
A homeboy's dying, fuck your car!

22:53.957 --> 22:57.502
"A homeboy!" Big deal!

22:57.961 --> 22:59.420
You disgust me!

22:59.587 --> 23:02.798
That car's all I have. It's my life!

23:02.966 --> 23:07.136
They're showing the riot!
- My car's more important!

23:07.303 --> 23:08.554
Look, the riot.

23:08.763 --> 23:10.473
Some TV!
- Sure, bust it!

23:10.640 --> 23:13.934
Fix the antenna!
- I'm trying!

23:14.144 --> 23:14.894
It's David!

23:15.311 --> 23:16.854
How'd he get on TV?

23:17.021 --> 23:19.773
I was over there, they missed me!

23:19.941 --> 23:23.778
Fix it! I can't see a thing!
- This TV sucks!

23:24.696 --> 23:27.323
How'd that fucker get on TV?

23:28.324 --> 23:30.617
Hey, gimme my money!

23:30.785 --> 23:32.786
I don't have it. Snoopy has it.

23:32.954 --> 23:36.082
Gimme my coat and get outta my face!

23:36.249 --> 23:38.292
You guys must be happy.

23:38.459 --> 23:41.003
A cop lost his gun in the riot.

23:43.673 --> 23:45.591
I hope the guy who finds it

23:45.758 --> 23:48.135
uses it uptown, not here for once!

23:48.344 --> 23:49.011
Forget it,

23:49.178 --> 23:50.804
we'll get even!

23:55.685 --> 23:58.354
You know that show, "Candid Camera"?

23:58.604 --> 24:02.441
So this celebrity's sure he's been set up.

24:02.900 --> 24:07.070
His buddy's fixed it with the camera guys.

24:07.238 --> 24:09.615
The celebrity thinks they're out to get him.

24:09.824 --> 24:12.451
He always eats in the same joint.

24:12.618 --> 24:15.704
He's sure they'll film him there.

24:15.872 --> 24:19.542
The others convince him there's a hidden camera.

24:19.709 --> 24:23.337
He sees the TV truck,
a camera behind the mirror

24:23.504 --> 24:26.924
and the guy with him pretends to act weird.

24:27.216 --> 24:30.594
The celebrity thinks he'll fool 'em,

24:30.761 --> 24:34.806
pretending he hasn't noticed.

24:34.974 --> 24:38.435
He thinks all hell will break loose.

24:38.602 --> 24:43.315
But they just film him, jumpy,
waiting for shit to happen.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.816
So you see this guy...

24:44.984 --> 24:47.111
Cut it out, Sayid!

24:47.319 --> 24:49.696
Wasn't me!
- Then who?

24:49.905 --> 24:54.242
The celebrity's sweating, trying to act cool.

24:54.410 --> 24:57.162
Each time the waiter passes

24:57.329 --> 24:59.205
he thinks it'll happen.

24:59.373 --> 25:03.210
Then a guy asks him for his autograph.

25:03.377 --> 25:05.462
The celeb thinks it's a trick

25:05.629 --> 25:08.089
and Starts ranting at the guy,

25:08.257 --> 25:12.844
who doesn't know what's up, so he gets mad.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.931
They Start fighting,

25:16.098 --> 25:18.642
and the Candid Camera guys have to break it up.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.645
It was a killer punch out.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.397
Then what?

25:25.441 --> 25:27.276
That's all.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.332
Who was the celebrity?

25:42.499 --> 25:44.751
Dunno, but he was real famous.

25:45.169 --> 25:46.503
I don't remember.

26:01.351 --> 26:05.021
This looks like trouble. See ya.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.455
WE'RE THE FUTURE

26:36.261 --> 26:37.804
What did they want?

26:38.555 --> 26:41.099
"Don't get mad, get even."

26:41.308 --> 26:45.228
It's Abdel's brother. He's got a pump gun.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.814
Party time!

26:52.819 --> 26:55.279
We go visit Abdel in the hospital?

26:59.743 --> 27:01.619
I gotta show you something...

27:09.919 --> 27:12.755
That's real steel!

27:13.006 --> 27:15.633
Get a load of it.
- What a mother!

27:25.310 --> 27:26.477
What'll you do with it?

27:26.686 --> 27:27.686
Stop it, Hubert.

27:27.896 --> 27:28.896
What you gonna do with it?

27:29.063 --> 27:30.939
Depends if Abdel dies.

27:31.107 --> 27:33.108
You gonna kill a cop?

27:33.276 --> 27:34.902
Best way to get respect!

27:35.069 --> 27:37.696
Smoking a cop will get you respect?

27:37.864 --> 27:39.907
It'll even up the score.

27:40.074 --> 27:43.243
I coulda got you a piece.
- This one's special.

27:43.536 --> 27:45.079
Think you're on a mission?

27:45.246 --> 27:48.999
Well, I did find the gun. Leave me alone!

27:49.208 --> 27:52.419
Will it help Abdel?
- It'll help us.

27:55.131 --> 27:56.215
Stop fronting!

27:56.382 --> 27:57.841
You pussy!

27:58.050 --> 27:59.551
You're headed for big shit!

27:59.719 --> 28:01.470
I'll do my thing, you do yours.

28:01.637 --> 28:05.140
I don't want to know.
- So don't ask!

28:09.103 --> 28:10.938
One thing's sure...

28:11.480 --> 28:14.399
With that piece you're the big man.

28:21.449 --> 28:23.409
Hey, wait for me!

28:33.878 --> 28:35.296
Fuck it...

28:41.886 --> 28:43.971
What the fuck ya doin'?

28:44.138 --> 28:47.099
OK, don't have a shit fit!

29:21.008 --> 29:22.718
Sorry, fellas, you can't go in.

29:22.885 --> 29:24.595
Let us in. We came to see Abdel.

29:24.762 --> 29:26.680
Sorry, I have my orders.

29:26.847 --> 29:30.392
Just a couple of minutes. Then we'll leave.

29:30.559 --> 29:32.018
He's our friend.

29:32.895 --> 29:36.064
The docs won't let you in. He's in a coma.

29:36.231 --> 29:37.857
We won't make trouble!

29:38.484 --> 29:40.485
If I let you in,

29:40.652 --> 29:42.820
I'll lose my job.
- Sure, flunkey!

29:42.988 --> 29:45.865
Tone it down. His family's here.

29:46.033 --> 29:48.160
They need peace and quiet!

29:48.327 --> 29:51.705
We're not as good as reporters?

29:51.872 --> 29:53.123
Get going!

29:53.790 --> 29:55.416
Hands off, man!

29:56.251 --> 29:58.378
You gonna make me leave?

29:58.545 --> 30:00.672
Gonna shoot me? Pull out your pop gun!

30:02.257 --> 30:03.841
What's going on here?

30:04.009 --> 30:05.552
Look at that fuckface!

30:06.511 --> 30:09.138
We came to see our pal Abdel!

30:10.515 --> 30:12.516
We won't leave till we see him.

30:12.684 --> 30:14.685
Beat it, before I take you in.

30:14.853 --> 30:15.937
Oh, yeah?

30:16.146 --> 30:17.397
You shut up!

30:19.608 --> 30:20.442
Move 'em out!

30:24.863 --> 30:28.366
We can be nice or nasty.
It's up to you!

30:30.452 --> 30:31.911
Calm down!

30:32.412 --> 30:35.039
Lieut., these kids made trouble.

30:35.206 --> 30:37.291
I got the ringleader.

30:38.668 --> 30:40.378
He did nothing.
- I arrested the leader.

30:40.545 --> 30:42.421
What leader?
- He means Sayid.

30:42.589 --> 30:43.464
Sure, Uncle Tom!

30:53.016 --> 30:55.143
Things aren't bad enough.

30:55.310 --> 30:57.520
You had to go to the hospital?

30:58.021 --> 30:59.272
They were only doing their job.

30:59.481 --> 31:01.107
Doing their job?

31:01.274 --> 31:03.943
Shut your yap, once and for all!

31:04.110 --> 31:06.403
You shut yours!
- Don't talk to me like that!

31:06.613 --> 31:09.324
Same to you!
- Shut up, will ya!

31:09.491 --> 31:10.658
Shit!

31:10.867 --> 31:12.451
You don't know a fucking thing!

31:12.619 --> 31:13.703
What do you know?

31:13.870 --> 31:15.705
Cut it out, asshole.

31:15.872 --> 31:17.999
Watch your tongue!
- If you watch yours!

31:19.167 --> 31:21.961
The bastards who beat up Abdel
will go to jail!

31:22.128 --> 31:24.088
You're dreaming.

31:24.339 --> 31:26.132
The cops at the hospital

31:26.299 --> 31:28.300
protect Abdel and his family.

31:28.926 --> 31:31.762
You just fuck things up!

31:32.305 --> 31:35.391
You idiot, you got it all wrong.

31:35.933 --> 31:39.144
Those cops are just protecting Abdel!

31:39.854 --> 31:43.524
Most cops don't beat on you.
They protect you!

31:45.068 --> 31:47.195
Who protects us from you?

33:05.439 --> 33:07.065
Never do it again!

33:07.232 --> 33:08.816
Who writes your jokes?

33:08.984 --> 33:11.027
Watch your tongue!

33:11.195 --> 33:13.030
Watch your mother!

33:15.908 --> 33:17.826
You ever trash me again,

33:17.993 --> 33:20.036
you go to central lock-up.

33:20.204 --> 33:22.998
Your brother can bail you out.

33:23.165 --> 33:25.792
I didn't ask no favors.
- I did it for your brother.

33:25.959 --> 33:28.294
He'd rip you apart!

33:29.755 --> 33:31.381
You're the ripper.

33:37.095 --> 33:40.765
About the boxing gym:
I can get you a City grant.

33:41.058 --> 33:43.310
You'll get another gym.

33:44.311 --> 33:47.897
Kids want to punch more than bags now!

33:48.065 --> 33:52.110
It's hopeless.
Once I could talk to the kids. No more.

33:52.277 --> 33:57.240
And they know me!
A rookie cop wouldn't last a month.

33:57.407 --> 34:00.034
An Arab in a police station
doesn't last an hour!

34:01.661 --> 34:04.747
I have to go.
Try to keep cool.

34:04.998 --> 34:07.542
Yeah, we'll try.

34:07.709 --> 34:10.335
Outta my face, you fucker!

34:10.504 --> 34:12.005
OK!

34:14.466 --> 34:15.466
You shook his hand?

34:15.634 --> 34:17.844
He's always been cool with me.

34:18.011 --> 34:20.138
You don't shake a pig's hand!

34:20.304 --> 34:25.059
You shoot him, I shake his hand!
You're a fuckin'pain!

34:25.226 --> 34:27.312
And you're out of it!
Look!

34:27.478 --> 34:29.688
I knew it!

34:29.856 --> 34:31.690
You acted so weird at the hospital.

34:31.858 --> 34:33.775
Take it easy.
- Let me see.

34:35.695 --> 34:36.695
You didn't tell us?

34:37.572 --> 34:39.072
You didn't want to know!

34:39.239 --> 34:41.158
Packing that!
You retard!

34:41.326 --> 34:44.036
I'm a big boy.
Quit preaching!

34:44.454 --> 34:46.164
I'll bust your chops!

34:46.373 --> 34:48.666
Stop it!

34:48.833 --> 34:52.503
You feel big with that gun!
I'll kick your ass!

34:52.712 --> 34:53.795
Like how?

34:53.963 --> 34:56.799
Cut it out. Let's grab a sandwich.

34:57.383 --> 34:59.134
You shut up!

34:59.677 --> 35:00.677
I'm splittin'.

35:00.845 --> 35:02.596
So split!

35:03.640 --> 35:05.308
Stay with us.

35:05.558 --> 35:07.142
Sayid, let him split!

35:08.478 --> 35:10.605
Don't go!

35:10.772 --> 35:12.023
Back off.

35:16.027 --> 35:18.154
What's with him?

35:20.865 --> 35:23.158
Jerk thinks too much.

35:39.133 --> 35:41.343
Where's Mom?
- Explain this to me.

35:41.511 --> 35:43.471
I can't now.

35:51.395 --> 35:52.729
Well?

35:53.898 --> 35:54.982
What's the answer?

35:55.191 --> 35:56.108
I don't know.

35:56.275 --> 35:58.819
You never know.
- OK, I never know.

35:59.070 --> 36:00.613
Hi, Mom.

36:00.905 --> 36:02.281
How's the kid brother?

36:02.448 --> 36:03.824
He's fine.

36:04.075 --> 36:07.453
But your brother in jail isn't so good.

36:07.703 --> 36:09.204
What's with Max?

36:09.372 --> 36:11.582
He needs textbooks.

36:11.749 --> 36:13.208
What for?

36:13.376 --> 36:17.213
To get a high school diploma
while he's inside.

36:19.340 --> 36:22.176
He never made grade school!

36:23.469 --> 36:25.679
Hands off the pots!

36:26.555 --> 36:27.806
I didn't do nothing!

36:28.057 --> 36:30.517
I dunno how I'll buy his books.

36:30.684 --> 36:31.851
By the way...

36:33.729 --> 36:35.313
There's the money
for the power bill.

36:41.111 --> 36:43.404
And my machine?
- What machine?

36:43.614 --> 36:47.075
My new sewing machine!

36:47.243 --> 36:49.954
Shit, I forgot to ask WalMart.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.831
Mine's ready to croak.

36:52.998 --> 36:55.333
Patou, go study in your room.

36:55.501 --> 36:58.170
Mom.
- Don't argue.

36:59.296 --> 37:01.756
Who's WalMart? That fence in Tower B?

37:01.924 --> 37:04.009
No, he's in Tower D.

37:04.176 --> 37:05.802
I don't know him.

37:06.053 --> 37:07.971
Could he get us textbooks?

37:08.138 --> 37:09.889
That's not his line, Mom.

37:10.057 --> 37:11.725
Officials now admit

37:11.892 --> 37:15.645
that a policeman lost his gun
in the riot last night.

37:15.854 --> 37:17.939
It is still missing.

37:18.106 --> 37:22.193
We asked locals if a loose gun is dangerous

37:22.361 --> 37:24.571
in this explosive situation...

37:24.947 --> 37:25.947
What a fuck up!

37:26.156 --> 37:28.157
They burned down the gym.

37:29.743 --> 37:34.873
I'm sick of the projects.
I want out. It's getting worse.

37:35.082 --> 37:38.168
I'm sure Vinz helped torch the gym.

37:39.419 --> 37:41.796
He's going wild, like Max.

37:43.382 --> 37:45.008
I have to get out.

37:46.176 --> 37:47.677
I have to leave this place.

37:47.969 --> 37:51.472
If you see a grocery, buy me a lettuce.

37:51.723 --> 37:52.890
No credit for you.

37:53.058 --> 37:56.644
My granma's a regular here!
So I'm 2 bits short!

37:57.270 --> 38:00.189
You're not your granma.

38:01.024 --> 38:02.650
Hands off!
- Just looking!

38:02.818 --> 38:05.153
Got two bits?
- How about one?

38:05.320 --> 38:07.488
One OK?
- One not OK.

38:08.615 --> 38:11.659
Gimme a coin, you dinosaur!

38:11.826 --> 38:13.410
No coins for you.

38:13.578 --> 38:15.621
OK... Now what?

38:15.789 --> 38:17.832
So what'll it be?

38:19.042 --> 38:20.793
I saw you!
- You saw what?

38:20.961 --> 38:23.672
Gimme the red peppers. They're cheaper.

38:24.422 --> 38:26.966
My granma'll kill me! She hates 'em.

38:29.427 --> 38:31.762
So shoot the Chink, grab the green peppers!

38:31.930 --> 38:33.890
It'll make granma's day!

41:04.248 --> 41:07.167
Fuck, fuck the po-lice...

41:56.049 --> 41:57.592
He's intense.

41:58.260 --> 41:59.427
Killer!

42:00.554 --> 42:02.180
A mother killer!

42:10.146 --> 42:13.065
Sayid, check out the cow.

42:13.233 --> 42:15.360
Fuck off with your cow!

42:15.610 --> 42:18.362
I swear!
- You said you'd cut my hair.

42:18.530 --> 42:20.573
The same cow! I saw it!

42:20.740 --> 42:22.074
You're the cow!

42:22.242 --> 42:24.786
It was the same fuckin' cow!

42:24.995 --> 42:26.663
You gotta believe me!

42:26.830 --> 42:27.997
Shut up!

42:32.127 --> 42:35.421
I'm Segnor Duck...

42:39.551 --> 42:42.637
I fucka you, I fucka her, I fucka him...

42:42.804 --> 42:46.224
OK Granma! So they're red peppers!

42:47.183 --> 42:49.727
You know this cow business.

42:49.936 --> 42:51.687
It's a weird trip.

42:51.855 --> 42:55.441
Don't wreck my hair!

42:55.608 --> 42:58.235
I gotta get laid! So watch it!

42:58.403 --> 43:00.321
I can mow a lawn, I'll try.

43:00.488 --> 43:01.155
A lawn?

43:01.322 --> 43:03.365
Sit your ass down.

43:04.325 --> 43:06.201
It's hot, Vinz.
- What?

43:06.369 --> 43:08.204
A cop's piece is hot.

43:08.371 --> 43:11.874
You said that already. Sit still, loser!

43:12.709 --> 43:14.085
I'll whack you.

43:14.377 --> 43:16.087
Don't move.

43:16.504 --> 43:18.422
If Abdel dies, you'll kill?

43:18.589 --> 43:21.550
Wanna be the next Arab iced by the pigs?

43:21.801 --> 43:22.009
Well, me neither.

43:22.135 --> 43:24.136
Well, me neither.

43:24.303 --> 43:26.304
So now you're an Arab!

43:26.472 --> 43:28.599
They think we're full of shit.

43:28.766 --> 43:31.894
But I'm not bullshitting about this, Sayid.

43:33.771 --> 43:35.022
Watch it!

43:35.231 --> 43:36.690
It's cool.

43:36.858 --> 43:39.944
Is this gun legit for a cop? What'd you do?

43:40.111 --> 43:41.987
Nothing, I swear it!

43:42.154 --> 43:44.531
Why swear?

43:44.699 --> 43:45.950
Because it's nothing.

43:46.117 --> 43:47.368
I'm cold there!

43:47.576 --> 43:50.036
It's cold in this room!

43:52.331 --> 43:55.542
I'll even it out, it'll be great!

43:55.710 --> 43:58.170
I got a date! Lemme see!

43:58.379 --> 44:00.130
No fuckin' trust!

44:00.965 --> 44:01.965
I didn't see!

44:02.174 --> 44:03.425
You didn't look!

44:05.219 --> 44:06.386
Trust me, dammit!

44:07.304 --> 44:08.805
It's a nice hole.

44:08.973 --> 44:10.391
A nice what?

44:10.558 --> 44:13.560
Trust me, or no haircut!

44:16.814 --> 44:18.273
Look at me, Sayid!

44:18.440 --> 44:20.108
Get outta here!

44:20.276 --> 44:21.986
Don't get bummed out!

44:23.571 --> 44:25.698
It's the style in New York.

44:25.906 --> 44:28.783
The killer cut, so stop whining!

44:28.951 --> 44:29.868
New York?

44:30.035 --> 44:33.705
They got hair like this in New York?
I look punk!

44:33.872 --> 44:34.706
Honest!

44:34.957 --> 44:35.957
Don't laugh!

44:36.125 --> 44:38.585
Give us a kiss, Sayid.

44:38.752 --> 44:40.420
Outta my face!

44:40.587 --> 44:43.464
No hard feelings, sucker!

44:46.593 --> 44:49.137
Hey pooch, your master's an asshole!

44:56.478 --> 44:58.021
There's your sister.

45:04.153 --> 45:06.488
Why're you here?
- And you?

45:06.655 --> 45:08.782
I'm asking the questions!

45:08.991 --> 45:11.368
You should be in school.

45:11.577 --> 45:13.954
Get outta here!

45:15.372 --> 45:17.582
Get lost, you cows.

45:18.834 --> 45:20.252
You still here?

45:22.921 --> 45:24.255
Get lost!

45:24.715 --> 45:26.341
You talk to my friends!

45:26.508 --> 45:28.051
To Vincent.

45:28.218 --> 45:32.055
The name's Vinz, not Vincent!
And don't talk to him!

45:32.264 --> 45:35.266
Get a move on!
- Don't push!

45:39.479 --> 45:41.689
Coming tonight?
- Where?

45:41.857 --> 45:44.818
Jason's brother's in a prize fight.

45:44.985 --> 45:47.278
Got tickets?
- Freebies.

45:47.446 --> 45:48.864
Killer!

45:50.657 --> 45:52.367
Who cut your hair, Sayid?

45:53.785 --> 45:55.786
Kids these days!

45:56.329 --> 45:57.121
Check that!

47:02.270 --> 47:03.938
Shit's happenin'!

47:15.408 --> 47:17.701
Abdel's my brother, pig!

47:20.163 --> 47:21.747
You're gonna pay!

47:23.499 --> 47:24.458
Step on it!

47:25.084 --> 47:26.251
It's stalled!

47:26.502 --> 47:28.420
Outta the car, freeze!

47:39.307 --> 47:41.642
Drop the gun!

47:46.022 --> 47:47.565
Freeze!

48:08.794 --> 48:09.794
Get back!

48:10.880 --> 48:12.298
Get the fuck out!

48:12.464 --> 48:14.674
Riot cops are coming!

48:14.925 --> 48:16.926
Get back, scum!

48:28.230 --> 48:30.106
Vinz, Hubert, this way!

48:33.944 --> 48:35.320
This way!

48:37.698 --> 48:38.865
Freeze!

48:42.244 --> 48:44.245
You crazy?

48:47.791 --> 48:48.958
Where were you?

48:49.585 --> 48:51.628
We fucked your mother!

48:57.384 --> 49:00.970
I swear the pig was right in my sights.

49:01.138 --> 49:04.140
I had him like I have you now!

49:05.601 --> 49:08.228
The sucker froze, shit his pants.

49:08.395 --> 49:10.647
Without Hubert, I'd have smoked him!

49:10.814 --> 49:12.732
Right in the mother!

49:12.899 --> 49:16.277
Hubert slugged him so hard he went into orbit!

49:16.445 --> 49:17.154
No!

49:17.321 --> 49:18.572
I swear it!

49:18.739 --> 49:20.115
Slugged a pig?

49:21.116 --> 49:23.076
You were great!

49:33.879 --> 49:37.007
THE WORLD IS YOURS

50:15.253 --> 50:17.171
Now what do we do?

50:20.633 --> 50:23.927
I gotta call to get my bucks.

50:30.518 --> 50:32.478
Got Snoopy's address?

50:33.146 --> 50:35.690
I'll wait, but not forever!

50:38.067 --> 50:42.446
This cost me a $3 chocolate milk!
I'd better collect!

50:42.947 --> 50:45.616
You want some, Vinz?

50:46.034 --> 50:47.034
Want some?
- No.

50:47.201 --> 50:48.285
You sure?

50:49.954 --> 50:51.997
Want some, Cousin Hubie?

50:52.749 --> 50:54.667
You're already chocolate!

51:00.298 --> 51:02.925
Will you guys stop sulking?

51:04.260 --> 51:07.596
Who's sulking? Not me!

51:07.764 --> 51:09.474
Unbelievable!
- Ask him!

51:09.640 --> 51:11.224
A couple of kids!

51:11.392 --> 51:15.395
Who's the kid?
- 2 kids worrying over jackshit!

51:15.563 --> 51:18.023
I'm 100% behind you!

51:18.774 --> 51:21.151
Wanting to kill a cop is jackshit!

51:22.320 --> 51:26.449
Tell your buddy to back off!
I never said I wanted to.

51:26.782 --> 51:27.491
Yes, you did!

51:27.658 --> 51:28.450
Yes!
- No!

51:28.618 --> 51:30.453
I didn't say that!

51:30.620 --> 51:32.663
I said if Abdel died,

51:32.830 --> 51:35.582
I'd smoke a cop. Not for the hell of it!

51:36.000 --> 51:38.001
Without my gun back there,

51:38.169 --> 51:40.004
we'd have been history!

51:40.171 --> 51:42.381
My name's not Rodney King!

51:42.548 --> 51:44.299
Not the same thing!

51:44.467 --> 51:47.803
Expect us to bring you gifts in jail?

51:48.512 --> 51:52.599
I expect nothing!
Not from a guy who kisses cop ass!

51:54.101 --> 51:55.769
Go ahead, laugh!

51:55.936 --> 51:57.771
Laugh!

51:57.938 --> 52:01.066
I'm fuckin' sick of the goddam system!

52:01.233 --> 52:05.070
We live in rat holes,
you do fuck-all to change things!

52:05.279 --> 52:07.364
Neither do you!

52:07.573 --> 52:09.950
You're my homeys, so I'll tell you:

52:10.159 --> 52:12.077
If Abdel dies, I hit back.

52:12.244 --> 52:14.120
I'll whack a pig!

52:16.415 --> 52:19.709
So they know we don't turn the other cheek now!

52:20.210 --> 52:22.003
Wow, what a speech!

52:22.171 --> 52:25.007
Half Moses, half Mickey Mouse.

52:25.174 --> 52:28.760
Forget it, Vinz. You're out of your league.

52:28.969 --> 52:31.638
If Abdel dies, we lose a friend?

52:31.805 --> 52:32.555
Right!

52:32.723 --> 52:35.392
If a cop dies, do all cops go away?

52:35.559 --> 52:39.479
You're just one guy!
You can't blow 'em all away!

52:39.688 --> 52:41.773
Who made you a preacher?

52:41.940 --> 52:44.609
You know what's right and wrong?

52:44.776 --> 52:47.653
Why do you side with the assholes?

52:47.821 --> 52:49.948
Who's the asshole?

52:50.115 --> 52:54.619
In school we learnt that hate breeds hate!

52:54.786 --> 52:57.914
I didn't go to school, I'm from the street!

52:58.081 --> 52:59.707
Know what it taught me?

52:59.875 --> 53:03.545
Turn the other cheek, you're dead mothafucka!

53:04.171 --> 53:09.301
Bullshit! You pointed a gun at a cop!
We coulda been killed!

53:09.468 --> 53:11.469
Nothing like a good shit!

53:12.637 --> 53:16.807
You believe in God? That's the wrong question.

53:16.975 --> 53:19.268
Does God believe in us?

53:19.478 --> 53:23.064
I once had a friend called Grunwalski.

53:23.273 --> 53:26.484
We were sent to Siberia together.

53:26.860 --> 53:30.363
When you go to a Siberian work camp,

53:30.530 --> 53:33.407
you travel in a cattle car.

53:33.575 --> 53:37.662
You roll across icy steppes for days,

53:37.829 --> 53:40.122
without seeing a soul.

53:40.290 --> 53:42.667
You huddle to keep warm.

53:42.959 --> 53:47.630
But it's hard to relieve yourself,
to take a shit,

53:47.797 --> 53:50.174
you can't do it on the train,

53:50.383 --> 53:53.302
and the only time the train stops

53:53.470 --> 53:57.140
is to take on water for the locomotive.

53:57.307 --> 54:00.351
But Grunwalski was shy.

54:00.518 --> 54:02.811
Even when we bathed together,

54:03.480 --> 54:04.647
he got upset.

54:04.814 --> 54:08.275
I used to kid him about it.

54:08.693 --> 54:13.531
So, the train stops
and everyone jumps out to shit

54:13.698 --> 54:15.616
on the tracks.

54:15.784 --> 54:19.162
I'd teased Grunwalski so much

54:19.329 --> 54:22.540
that he went off on his own.

54:22.790 --> 54:25.584
The train Starts moving,

54:25.752 --> 54:27.962
so everyone jumps on,

54:28.213 --> 54:30.840
because it waits for nobody.

54:31.341 --> 54:33.634
Grunwalski had a problem:

54:33.843 --> 54:36.887
He'd gone behind a bush

54:37.055 --> 54:39.015
and was still shitting.

54:39.474 --> 54:43.686
So I see him come out from behind the bush,

54:43.853 --> 54:48.482
holding up his pants with his hands.

54:48.691 --> 54:51.318
He tries to catch up.

54:51.819 --> 54:53.695
I hold out my hand,

54:53.863 --> 54:56.699
but each time he reaches for it

54:56.866 --> 54:58.617
he lets go of his pants

54:58.785 --> 55:01.078
and they drop to his ankles.

55:01.454 --> 55:03.205
He pulls them back up,

55:03.372 --> 55:05.123
Starts running again,

55:05.291 --> 55:08.752
but they fall back down,

55:08.920 --> 55:11.380
when he reaches out for me.

55:12.924 --> 55:15.092
Then what happened?
- Nothing.

55:15.593 --> 55:16.969
Grunwalski...

55:18.137 --> 55:19.972
froze to death.

55:22.058 --> 55:22.975
Good day.

55:29.940 --> 55:31.691
Why'd he tell us that?

55:40.076 --> 55:42.453
I got the address. I'll call you.

55:46.081 --> 55:47.832
Why'd he tell us that?

56:03.891 --> 56:06.184
'Xcuse me, I'm just out of the hospital.

56:06.352 --> 56:08.437
I haven't eaten for 2 days.

56:08.604 --> 56:12.441
My child's hungry, I need your spare change...

56:14.568 --> 56:17.279
I wanna date with Mina!

56:17.446 --> 56:19.364
I'll lasso her!

56:20.491 --> 56:23.118
What d'you want? My dad's in jail,

56:23.285 --> 56:25.829
my mom's in jail, my whole family is!

56:25.996 --> 56:28.081
Get a job like everyone else!

56:28.290 --> 56:30.917
What is this, Mardi Gras?

56:33.921 --> 56:35.756
I want Mina!

56:38.133 --> 56:42.679
I'm homeless, my welfare ran out.

56:42.930 --> 56:46.933
I got out of a halfway house...

56:47.100 --> 56:49.560
It's a block away.

56:49.937 --> 56:50.520
Thanks.

56:50.687 --> 56:52.146
Have a nice day, sir.

56:52.314 --> 56:53.398
Thanks.

56:57.903 --> 57:00.363
The pigs are fuckin' polite around here!

57:01.698 --> 57:03.741
Even called me sir!

57:15.003 --> 57:17.463
Maybe he won the lottery!

57:22.219 --> 57:24.512
Damn, it's locked!

57:25.722 --> 57:27.890
What's his real name?

57:28.058 --> 57:30.852
I only know him as Snoopy.

57:38.026 --> 57:40.903
Yes?
- Sorry to bother you.

57:41.071 --> 57:42.739
I'm looking for...

57:42.989 --> 57:44.156
Snoopy.

57:44.783 --> 57:46.993
It sounds weird.
- Very funny!

57:49.120 --> 57:51.121
The fucker hung up.

57:51.956 --> 57:53.207
You try.

57:53.375 --> 57:55.418
Why me?
- Try!

57:56.002 --> 57:58.003
Darkie and me will get shot at!

58:00.757 --> 58:02.258
Hello.
- Yes?

58:02.425 --> 58:04.301
Is Snoopy there?

58:05.136 --> 58:07.221
No, but Charlie Brown is!

58:11.309 --> 58:14.061
You fucked it up, you asshole!

58:14.229 --> 58:15.313
Stop that!

58:15.522 --> 58:17.315
Sorry to bother you.

58:17.482 --> 58:21.819
Our pal Snoopy lives here,
we don't know his real name.

58:21.986 --> 58:25.364
Stop ringing! You thinka da world is yours?

58:25.531 --> 58:27.449
Unreal!

58:31.120 --> 58:33.080
No, we're staying!

58:36.751 --> 58:38.752
So call the cops, you spic!

58:38.920 --> 58:39.670
Sayid?

58:40.797 --> 58:42.131
Snoopy?

58:42.840 --> 58:44.967
What floor?
- 5th.

58:45.218 --> 58:46.302
We're coming!

58:48.846 --> 58:50.681
Snoopy? Is no name!

58:50.848 --> 58:52.683
You always make a trouble!

59:05.863 --> 59:07.906
Were you followed?
- No.

59:08.074 --> 59:09.784
No one?
- Nobody!

59:09.951 --> 59:11.202
You sure?
- Why?

59:11.410 --> 59:12.661
Because...

59:16.540 --> 59:17.123
You cool?

59:17.291 --> 59:18.667
Great!

59:18.834 --> 59:20.335
Check that kitchen.

59:20.795 --> 59:22.296
Who's this dude?

59:24.215 --> 59:26.967
Nice space! You win the lottery?

59:27.134 --> 59:30.804
A guy loaned it to me. He ain't gettin' it back!

59:30.971 --> 59:34.140
This is no apartment, it's a palace!

59:34.475 --> 59:35.475
I don't believe it.

59:35.684 --> 59:38.061
Bitchin' apartment!

59:38.229 --> 59:41.148
Snoopy, meet Vinz.

59:43.442 --> 59:45.277
This is Cousin Hubert!

59:45.820 --> 59:47.238
We've met before!

59:48.030 --> 59:49.740
Line of coke?
- No.

59:49.907 --> 59:51.491
You sure?
- No thanks.

59:51.659 --> 59:54.411
A little line of coke?

59:54.578 --> 59:57.205
No one for coke?

59:57.581 --> 59:59.624
How's your bro?
- OK.

59:59.792 --> 01:00:01.543
Mean fuckin' dude!

01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:04.003
He still a maniac?
- And you?

01:00:04.171 --> 01:00:06.172
Fuckin' A! Watch!

01:00:06.966 --> 01:00:08.384
So you got my cash?

01:00:08.759 --> 01:00:09.926
My bread!

01:00:10.135 --> 01:00:13.513
Make it snappy, Snoopy!

01:00:13.681 --> 01:00:15.808
Cut the bullshit!

01:00:19.144 --> 01:00:20.311
Come get it.

01:00:21.063 --> 01:00:23.231
Comin' at you, Bruce Lee!

01:00:29.404 --> 01:00:31.280
Hands off!
- What?

01:00:31.448 --> 01:00:33.908
Not for kids! It's my gun!

01:00:35.869 --> 01:00:38.705
So what? I got a piece too.

01:00:40.666 --> 01:00:41.750
Let's see!

01:00:42.626 --> 01:00:44.002
Whip it out.

01:00:48.048 --> 01:00:48.965
Fuck!

01:00:49.132 --> 01:00:50.466
Don't, Vinz!

01:00:50.676 --> 01:00:51.760
He knows guns.

01:00:51.969 --> 01:00:55.305
A snub-nosed Smith & Wesson Magnum 44.

01:00:56.098 --> 01:00:57.182
Watch it!

01:00:57.391 --> 01:00:58.475
It's loaded.

01:00:59.559 --> 01:01:00.726
Mean piece.

01:01:01.645 --> 01:01:03.188
You're a gangsta.

01:01:04.398 --> 01:01:06.108
It's for self-defense.

01:01:06.274 --> 01:01:08.275
You into magic?

01:01:08.443 --> 01:01:09.360
Watch.

01:01:09.736 --> 01:01:10.903
One bullet.

01:01:15.075 --> 01:01:16.242
I missed.

01:01:16.785 --> 01:01:17.952
You're nuts!

01:01:18.161 --> 01:01:21.163
That's live ammo!
- It's an old trick!

01:01:21.915 --> 01:01:22.999
Cool it.

01:01:23.208 --> 01:01:26.586
We up the stakes: 2 bullets!

01:01:27.587 --> 01:01:28.754
Snoopy!

01:01:28.922 --> 01:01:31.633
Wiggin' out, guys?

01:01:32.217 --> 01:01:33.968
You're nuts.

01:01:34.135 --> 01:01:35.219
Gimme!

01:01:37.138 --> 01:01:38.305
Your turn.

01:01:38.473 --> 01:01:40.391
Let's go, he's fried.

01:01:40.558 --> 01:01:41.475
Gonna do it?

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.270
Gimme.
- Do it!

01:01:45.897 --> 01:01:47.398
I did it, you do it!

01:01:47.565 --> 01:01:49.441
Man, you want trouble?

01:01:49.609 --> 01:01:51.319
Do it!

01:01:52.237 --> 01:01:53.488
Chill, guys!

01:01:55.782 --> 01:01:57.200
Stop, Vinz!

01:01:57.367 --> 01:01:58.701
You aiming at me?

01:01:58.868 --> 01:02:00.703
You're off your head!

01:02:01.079 --> 01:02:02.747
You bet I'm aiming at you!

01:02:02.914 --> 01:02:05.041
No one fucks with me!

01:02:05.959 --> 01:02:08.419
I'm not some ass-wipe!

01:02:09.754 --> 01:02:11.172
Wanna see a gun?

01:02:11.339 --> 01:02:12.965
A fuckin' gun?

01:02:16.719 --> 01:02:18.762
Sayid, get him out!

01:02:20.515 --> 01:02:22.225
We're outta here!

01:02:25.353 --> 01:02:28.147
Up your mother's slash, sucker!

01:02:29.315 --> 01:02:30.315
Look!

01:02:34.487 --> 01:02:37.531
That's right, asshole!

01:02:38.032 --> 01:02:39.116
He was bluffing!

01:02:39.325 --> 01:02:43.579
Now I'll never get my cash!

01:02:43.746 --> 01:02:46.874
Leave us out of your games, Vinz!

01:02:47.041 --> 01:02:51.795
Games? We got a pal in the hospital!

01:02:51.963 --> 01:02:53.964
Don't take on the world!

01:02:54.131 --> 01:02:56.299
You got the wrong build!

01:02:56.467 --> 01:03:00.304
I'm not like you, Mr. Black Hercules, right?

01:03:00.513 --> 01:03:01.764
Go fuck yourself!

01:03:02.139 --> 01:03:03.306
Fuck myself?

01:03:10.898 --> 01:03:12.649
Alright, kids!

01:03:12.817 --> 01:03:14.360
Who're you?
- Easy!

01:03:14.527 --> 01:03:16.654
You had your fun!

01:03:16.862 --> 01:03:18.321
Easy!

01:03:21.534 --> 01:03:23.160
Search them.

01:03:23.327 --> 01:03:26.121
Fast work! In my 'hood, the cops come

01:03:26.288 --> 01:03:28.498
a week after you're dead!

01:03:28.749 --> 01:03:30.208
Hey, you!

01:03:31.335 --> 01:03:34.296
You together?
- I don't know them.

01:03:34.463 --> 01:03:35.922
Why you here?

01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:38.050
I live with my aunt!

01:03:38.217 --> 01:03:39.384
What's her name?

01:03:39.593 --> 01:03:41.344
Mrs. Zyl...

01:03:42.846 --> 01:03:46.975
Got I.D.?
- I'm on the level...

01:03:54.441 --> 01:03:56.401
Easy!

01:03:56.568 --> 01:03:58.569
Freeze!

01:03:58.779 --> 01:04:00.322
Don't move, boy!

01:04:01.198 --> 01:04:02.198
You know him?

01:04:02.366 --> 01:04:03.825
Who?
- Your pal.

01:04:03.992 --> 01:04:05.576
I don't know him.

01:04:06.787 --> 01:04:09.331
We'll see about that, wise guy!

01:04:10.374 --> 01:04:12.459
This is humiliating!
- Too bad.

01:04:14.253 --> 01:04:15.796
What's this?

01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:17.714
Good stuff!

01:04:18.048 --> 01:04:20.508
I'm keeping it.

01:04:22.386 --> 01:04:24.679
Afghan's the best.

01:04:25.138 --> 01:04:27.181
Good buzz going up and down.

01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:29.893
Same with Black Bombay.

01:04:30.143 --> 01:04:32.311
Lebanese can really vary.

01:04:32.479 --> 01:04:36.399
This is crap but I'll keep it... Well?

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:40.069
The little fucker outran me. Take them in.

01:04:40.237 --> 01:04:41.780
Get in the back.
- Why me?

01:04:41.947 --> 01:04:43.323
Get in!

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.213
Listen, scumbag. You know what I think of you?

01:04:59.464 --> 01:05:01.465
You're like poodle shit on a sidewalk.

01:05:01.633 --> 01:05:03.926
I can't take a step

01:05:04.094 --> 01:05:08.473
without squashing your ugly dog-turd face.

01:05:09.015 --> 01:05:12.101
So watch where the dog dumps you!

01:06:08.366 --> 01:06:09.700
You're all alone!

01:06:10.326 --> 01:06:12.077
Far from the slums...

01:06:12.662 --> 01:06:14.080
and your looter pals.

01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:17.500
Pick it up with your feet.

01:06:18.167 --> 01:06:20.210
Like your people do back home.

01:06:21.504 --> 01:06:23.797
They're great with their feet.

01:06:25.299 --> 01:06:27.426
This is the hard part.

01:06:31.472 --> 01:06:34.808
OK, there's no big hurry.

01:06:34.976 --> 01:06:37.186
In 2 hours, they may be free.

01:06:37.353 --> 01:06:39.188
Make the most of it.

01:06:41.691 --> 01:06:45.444
How 'bout a bullet in the back of your head?

01:06:45.945 --> 01:06:47.780
A nice little bullet?

01:06:47.947 --> 01:06:50.324
You gotta stop in time.

01:06:50.491 --> 01:06:52.868
You need self-control.

01:06:53.035 --> 01:06:54.661
Gotta be a pro.

01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:57.498
This takes control.

01:06:59.166 --> 01:07:01.209
Don't get mad! It won't last!

01:07:04.422 --> 01:07:07.258
You got something to say?

01:07:07.883 --> 01:07:11.094
Don't touch him!

01:07:11.512 --> 01:07:13.889
You know this one?

01:07:14.098 --> 01:07:15.974
The Shanghai Squeeze.

01:07:16.183 --> 01:07:18.226
It's an oldie.

01:07:20.187 --> 01:07:23.023
Wait, I think he's thirsty.

01:07:24.817 --> 01:07:26.193
Fucker!

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.487
Don't hurt yourself!

01:07:28.696 --> 01:07:30.989
Take it easy!

01:07:32.157 --> 01:07:34.200
Don't get me aroused.

01:07:34.535 --> 01:07:36.662
You look like a bitch from behind!

01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:40.332
A nice bitch to suck me off!

01:07:42.084 --> 01:07:43.543
Blow jobs!

01:07:43.836 --> 01:07:45.671
Bitches to suck my dick!

01:07:46.255 --> 01:07:49.091
That's the way. Then you relax!

01:07:49.425 --> 01:07:52.094
But it's hard to stop in time.

01:07:52.261 --> 01:07:54.429
You gotta stay in control.

01:07:58.559 --> 01:07:59.726
That's the trick.

01:07:59.935 --> 01:08:01.394
I like his face.

01:08:01.562 --> 01:08:02.562
He's cute.

01:08:03.147 --> 01:08:05.023
What was the name?

01:08:06.775 --> 01:08:10.361
Are you cute?
- Yes! I'm cute!

01:08:10.779 --> 01:08:13.448
I'm cute!

01:08:15.409 --> 01:08:17.077
Which one?
- He's Hubert.

01:08:17.243 --> 01:08:18.703
That's no Hubert!

01:08:18.871 --> 01:08:20.747
He's French, he's Sayid.

01:08:20.913 --> 01:08:22.790
Sayid? That's pretty!

01:08:22.957 --> 01:08:26.044
Is Sayid a French name?

01:08:26.211 --> 01:08:28.587
Aren't they pretty?

01:08:29.381 --> 01:08:31.841
Take a good look!

01:08:33.926 --> 01:08:36.011
The little guy's excited.

01:08:36.179 --> 01:08:39.223
Leave him alone!

01:08:46.898 --> 01:08:48.983
It's so easy to go too far!

01:08:49.151 --> 01:08:52.237
But you mustn't! Though you're dying to!

01:08:52.946 --> 01:08:55.740
Right, you Arab sonofabitch?

01:08:58.577 --> 01:09:00.245
OK, let's go.

01:09:22.392 --> 01:09:24.185
Sir!

01:09:24.352 --> 01:09:26.228
We'll miss the last train!

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:27.647
Forget it.

01:09:27.856 --> 01:09:28.939
Bastard!

01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:31.859
Did I talk to you?

01:10:03.558 --> 01:10:05.142
Yo, Vinz!

01:10:06.686 --> 01:10:08.354
Where's Sayid and Hubert?

01:10:08.521 --> 01:10:10.898
Dunno. They pissed me off tonight.

01:10:11.107 --> 01:10:13.567
You guys are always fussin'!

01:10:44.015 --> 01:10:45.433
Your sister's hot.

01:10:46.142 --> 01:10:48.435
Shut up, asshole.

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:50.729
Sorry, but she's hot.

01:10:50.896 --> 01:10:52.772
You don't stand a chance.

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:54.983
Don't you try.

01:10:56.277 --> 01:10:58.529
Don't even look at her!

01:10:58.696 --> 01:11:00.322
Check the turn!

01:11:00.489 --> 01:11:03.283
I won't try 'cause she's pregnant.

01:11:03.451 --> 01:11:07.454
Don't diss my sis', butthead!

01:11:19.258 --> 01:11:21.259
Brothers, I gotta make it

01:11:21.427 --> 01:11:23.720
by any means necessary

01:11:23.929 --> 01:11:26.306
'cos my mind's playin' tricks on me.

01:11:31.937 --> 01:11:33.480
You won't let us in?

01:11:33.647 --> 01:11:35.440
Beat it!

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:41.321
That nigger bouncer never lets us in!

01:11:41.488 --> 01:11:43.281
We know his bro for 10 years!

01:11:43.449 --> 01:11:46.660
And he still gives us shit!

01:11:47.119 --> 01:11:48.870
Drives me crazy!

01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:51.957
What's up with the flare gun?

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:54.752
Where you going?

01:11:55.085 --> 01:11:56.628
Don't be a hot dog!

01:11:59.423 --> 01:12:00.590
Stop!

01:12:01.258 --> 01:12:04.135
I told you I'd be back!

01:12:05.762 --> 01:12:07.680
Not so big now, fuckface!

01:12:07.848 --> 01:12:11.142
You and your stinkin' club!

01:12:11.476 --> 01:12:14.604
Fuck your club!

01:12:14.771 --> 01:12:17.148
Goddam nigger!

01:12:35.625 --> 01:12:37.376
That cop made us miss it.

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.255
Dickless fuckin' Tracy!

01:12:53.852 --> 01:12:55.562
When's the next one?

01:12:55.979 --> 01:12:57.397
Tomorrow morning.

01:13:38.438 --> 01:13:40.356
How much did Snoopy owe you?

01:13:40.523 --> 01:13:41.273
What?

01:13:41.482 --> 01:13:43.150
What'd he owe you?

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:44.569
One.

01:13:44.736 --> 01:13:46.946
$1,000?
- No, $100.

01:13:47.155 --> 01:13:48.239
What?

01:13:48.531 --> 01:13:50.783
All this shit for a lousy $100!

01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:53.702
It's the principle that counts.

01:13:55.705 --> 01:13:57.498
Principle!

01:13:59.751 --> 01:14:02.211
Coyote's a bad motherfucker.

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.964
Roadrunner's a pussy.

01:14:05.256 --> 01:14:07.716
Pick between Tweetie and Sylvester.

01:14:08.384 --> 01:14:10.177
Fuck you and Tweetie!

01:14:10.344 --> 01:14:13.472
I don't take shit from a guy who sees cows!

01:14:13.639 --> 01:14:17.017
I say Sylvester's the real gangsta.

01:14:17.643 --> 01:14:19.519
Bottom line! 'Nuff said!

01:14:19.687 --> 01:14:23.357
Can't talk with you guys if you won't listen.

01:14:23.524 --> 01:14:25.150
'Cause you listen?

01:14:25.318 --> 01:14:27.862
You got it all wrong.

01:14:28.029 --> 01:14:32.158
I say Tweetie's the baddest. He always wins.

01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:34.034
That's bullshit!

01:14:34.327 --> 01:14:37.163
Sylvester fucks Tweetie and you!

01:14:37.788 --> 01:14:39.122
Come again?

01:14:39.874 --> 01:14:42.084
Who does he fuck? Me?

01:14:42.293 --> 01:14:44.211
Anyway, Sylvester's a black brother.

01:14:44.378 --> 01:14:46.004
A black brother?

01:14:46.422 --> 01:14:47.589
Full of shit!

01:14:48.299 --> 01:14:50.676
Shall we, gentlemen?

01:14:50.843 --> 01:14:52.678
What can we lose?

01:15:00.519 --> 01:15:04.105
It's positively frightful!

01:15:11.113 --> 01:15:12.823
Is this guy famous?

01:15:14.825 --> 01:15:17.536
He will be when he grows up!

01:15:34.887 --> 01:15:38.390
There's Champagne, Cinzano, Bogardi...

01:15:38.599 --> 01:15:40.392
I don't drink.
- I mean Bacardi.

01:15:40.559 --> 01:15:41.559
Outta my way.

01:15:43.103 --> 01:15:44.521
I want peanuts.

01:15:48.067 --> 01:15:49.526
Cheers, Charles!

01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:51.986
Hey, Charles!

01:15:52.154 --> 01:15:54.948
Behave, asshole!

01:15:57.409 --> 01:15:59.953
Let 'em through, Sayid!

01:16:01.163 --> 01:16:02.956
Check out the babes!

01:16:03.123 --> 01:16:05.124
That's what I call women!

01:16:06.001 --> 01:16:07.961
The sister is hot.

01:16:09.504 --> 01:16:10.671
Do me a favor.

01:16:10.839 --> 01:16:12.549
I'm not going!

01:16:12.883 --> 01:16:15.427
Who bought the tacos last week?

01:16:15.594 --> 01:16:17.721
You owe me one.

01:16:17.888 --> 01:16:19.222
Get me the sister.

01:16:19.556 --> 01:16:20.723
Awright.

01:16:21.642 --> 01:16:23.435
There's just two!

01:16:23.602 --> 01:16:25.103
Who cares?
- Shut up!

01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:27.438
Get her for me, Hubert!

01:16:33.653 --> 01:16:36.030
Excuse me, my name's Hubert.

01:16:36.531 --> 01:16:40.660
My friend's a romantic, he's really shy.

01:16:40.827 --> 01:16:43.204
He'd love to meet you.

01:16:43.413 --> 01:16:44.831
That's him.

01:16:46.875 --> 01:16:47.959
What d'ya say?

01:16:48.126 --> 01:16:50.419
Look what you did to me!

01:16:51.296 --> 01:16:52.964
He's really cool.

01:16:53.131 --> 01:16:56.467
He's too nice.
- OK, then!

01:16:56.635 --> 01:16:57.969
C'mon Sayid!

01:16:59.095 --> 01:17:00.179
Hold this.

01:17:02.057 --> 01:17:04.225
Haven't we met before?

01:17:04.434 --> 01:17:05.810
Don't I wish!

01:17:05.977 --> 01:17:07.228
Hi, girls!

01:17:07.395 --> 01:17:08.062
I'm Sayid.

01:17:10.231 --> 01:17:12.566
Please don't lean on the painting.

01:17:12.734 --> 01:17:13.818
You're the painting!

01:17:15.695 --> 01:17:16.529
I'm good at what?

01:17:16.696 --> 01:17:17.863
Guess, babe!

01:17:18.073 --> 01:17:19.908
We heard you were shy!

01:17:20.075 --> 01:17:23.495
Shy? That's my middle name!

01:17:24.287 --> 01:17:26.831
What's your number? We'll go out.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.500
You're all alike!

01:17:29.709 --> 01:17:31.836
He said you wanted to talk.

01:17:32.045 --> 01:17:34.505
Talk? What about?

01:17:35.882 --> 01:17:38.676
Lighten up! We were ready to talk,

01:17:38.843 --> 01:17:42.930
but with your attitude, how can we respect you?

01:17:43.097 --> 01:17:46.475
Who are you? The Wonderbra bitch?

01:17:46.643 --> 01:17:49.103
Who asked you?
- I'm asking you!

01:17:49.312 --> 01:17:50.938
He's nuts.

01:17:51.356 --> 01:17:53.691
What are you staring at?

01:17:54.192 --> 01:17:55.443
Got a screw loose?

01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:57.611
You're the screw.

01:17:59.405 --> 01:18:02.324
Stop!
- What's wrong with you?

01:18:03.117 --> 01:18:06.620
Leave us alone, we didn't ask you over!

01:18:06.788 --> 01:18:08.498
Gentlemen, please!

01:18:08.664 --> 01:18:10.707
It's cool, Pops!

01:18:10.875 --> 01:18:14.712
Nobody's been hurt! What's your beef?

01:18:14.921 --> 01:18:17.757
Keep your heads, please.
- Please what?

01:18:18.925 --> 01:18:20.009
Let's go!

01:18:20.551 --> 01:18:22.177
Pretty please!

01:18:22.345 --> 01:18:24.805
Let's all calm down!

01:18:25.139 --> 01:18:26.390
Stop that!

01:18:26.557 --> 01:18:27.933
Stop your friend.

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.852
You're not my friend! Fuck you!

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:34.314
Know what?

01:18:34.774 --> 01:18:36.901
Go suck cocks in hell!

01:18:37.068 --> 01:18:40.446
With your mothers!
- You're all ugly!

01:18:40.613 --> 01:18:43.157
I'm fuckin' sorry, sir!

01:18:46.285 --> 01:18:48.495
Have fun, mothafuckas!

01:18:51.791 --> 01:18:53.209
Troubled youth!

01:18:53.375 --> 01:18:55.293
We shoulda swiped a bottle.

01:18:55.461 --> 01:18:58.463
I got the sucker's charge card!

01:18:58.631 --> 01:19:01.300
Hubert! Up to your old tricks!

01:19:01.467 --> 01:19:03.552
Like riding a bike: You don't forget.

01:19:03.719 --> 01:19:06.263
Mr. David Moe?

01:19:08.432 --> 01:19:10.058
He's not here?

01:19:10.809 --> 01:19:12.310
We keep it for him!

01:19:12.478 --> 01:19:14.229
Give it to me.

01:19:16.065 --> 01:19:17.816
What's the score?

01:19:17.983 --> 01:19:19.150
Killer!

01:19:19.568 --> 01:19:21.361
Know what I'm saying?

01:19:22.738 --> 01:19:24.865
Your name's not David!

01:19:25.032 --> 01:19:26.992
And cabs don't take plastic.

01:19:27.159 --> 01:19:28.410
Just this once.

01:19:28.619 --> 01:19:30.746
Gimme a break!

01:19:35.501 --> 01:19:36.668
You fart?

01:19:37.086 --> 01:19:38.504
It was you. Who else?

01:19:38.670 --> 01:19:41.047
It stinks. Had to be you.

01:19:41.215 --> 01:19:42.299
That's not my stink.

01:19:42.466 --> 01:19:43.967
I know your farts.

01:19:44.134 --> 01:19:46.594
Mothafucka, we're locked out.

01:19:52.351 --> 01:19:53.351
Who farted?

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:54.894
He did.
- He did.

01:19:56.688 --> 01:19:58.564
Can't you tell?

01:20:00.150 --> 01:20:01.526
It was him.

01:20:01.693 --> 01:20:03.903
Your ass reeks.

01:20:04.905 --> 01:20:08.491
Motherfucking goddam steering wheel!

01:20:08.659 --> 01:20:10.786
Cut the poetry

01:20:10.952 --> 01:20:12.828
and pull the thing!

01:20:12.996 --> 01:20:16.416
Jean-Claude does this in five seconds flat.

01:20:16.583 --> 01:20:17.667
Which Jean-Claude?

01:20:17.876 --> 01:20:18.876
The mailman?

01:20:19.086 --> 01:20:22.672
No, that's Sylvie's boyfriend.

01:20:22.839 --> 01:20:25.299
This guy got 2 years for car theft.

01:20:25.509 --> 01:20:27.719
Move it, bust the fucker!

01:20:27.886 --> 01:20:31.139
Use your foot!

01:20:52.786 --> 01:20:54.120
Don't be a sissy.

01:20:54.287 --> 01:20:56.664
Who's a sissy?

01:21:01.252 --> 01:21:03.379
Relax, Max.

01:21:13.348 --> 01:21:16.726
"Night of the Living Car!"

01:21:18.728 --> 01:21:20.604
The wipers!

01:21:25.318 --> 01:21:27.278
Rip open that plastic box.

01:21:27.445 --> 01:21:29.196
Open sesame!

01:21:31.532 --> 01:21:35.369
Connect the green wire to the red one.

01:21:35.536 --> 01:21:37.913
Nah, that's for the blinkers.

01:21:38.081 --> 01:21:40.458
How'd they do it in on TV?

01:21:40.625 --> 01:21:42.835
Fuck TV!

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:46.756
Start the mother!

01:21:50.677 --> 01:21:51.844
Who the fuck's he?

01:21:54.097 --> 01:21:55.890
Freaked me out!

01:21:56.974 --> 01:21:58.642
Who the fuck are you?

01:21:58.810 --> 01:22:00.478
Huh?
- What you doin'?

01:22:00.645 --> 01:22:01.729
Nothing.

01:22:01.938 --> 01:22:03.731
So go somewhere else.

01:22:03.898 --> 01:22:05.899
Move, you'll get us nabbed.

01:22:06.067 --> 01:22:07.234
It's my wife...

01:22:07.443 --> 01:22:08.527
What about her?

01:22:09.987 --> 01:22:10.862
She left me.

01:22:11.822 --> 01:22:13.949
Do we fuckin' care?

01:22:15.952 --> 01:22:18.079
Don't wait for the law, Start it.

01:22:18.246 --> 01:22:20.039
Move!

01:22:20.206 --> 01:22:22.416
The red wire to the green wire.

01:22:22.583 --> 01:22:25.252
Lay off, that's for the horn!

01:22:25.419 --> 01:22:26.586
Try the blue, jerk!

01:22:27.546 --> 01:22:30.966
You do it! If you're so smart.

01:22:31.133 --> 01:22:32.300
I'll kill you!!

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:35.888
You're a drag.

01:22:36.806 --> 01:22:39.016
That wire's for the horn.

01:22:39.892 --> 01:22:40.642
No, that's the horn!

01:22:42.812 --> 01:22:44.647
Sayid's right.

01:22:44.814 --> 01:22:46.732
You see?

01:22:46.899 --> 01:22:49.818
Who was right? We do it my way!

01:22:49.985 --> 01:22:51.611
Gimme some metal!

01:22:51.779 --> 01:22:53.238
Move it!

01:22:54.532 --> 01:22:56.533
You're a good guy. What's your name?

01:22:58.702 --> 01:23:00.328
You got a name?

01:23:02.873 --> 01:23:05.500
At least we put it to good use!

01:23:07.044 --> 01:23:09.421
Ready? Watch this.

01:23:22.434 --> 01:23:24.269
Anyone know how to drive?

01:23:24.687 --> 01:23:27.231
Vinz does.
- Wait a second.

01:23:27.398 --> 01:23:30.067
I never learned, I got no licence.

01:23:30.317 --> 01:23:32.444
He does. He was in the Army.

01:23:32.611 --> 01:23:34.904
The Navy! I can't drive.

01:23:35.489 --> 01:23:36.740
I can!

01:23:36.949 --> 01:23:38.325
Shut up!

01:23:40.202 --> 01:23:41.202
Vinz?
- What?

01:23:41.370 --> 01:23:45.499
You took that bitch around Israel in a Mercedes.

01:23:45.999 --> 01:23:48.876
Not the same thing!

01:23:49.044 --> 01:23:51.212
That was different. It was... uh...

01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:53.840
It was an automatic...

01:23:54.383 --> 01:23:55.300
More like a dream!

01:23:58.053 --> 01:24:00.054
You guys are so lame!

01:24:02.975 --> 01:24:04.601
Now what?

01:24:06.353 --> 01:24:09.689
Sorry, but a cop car's coming.

01:24:09.856 --> 01:24:11.899
Where?
- That's a cop car.

01:24:12.067 --> 01:24:13.067
It's real close.

01:24:15.821 --> 01:24:18.198
On three, we're outta here, OK?

01:24:18.824 --> 01:24:19.533
Ready?

01:24:19.699 --> 01:24:20.199
Three!

01:24:27.666 --> 01:24:29.167
Freeze!

01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:34.964
Out of the way!

01:24:52.023 --> 01:24:54.692
Sometimes you feel so fuckin' small...

01:24:55.235 --> 01:24:57.236
Got any more bullshit wisdom?

01:24:57.404 --> 01:25:00.323
"The early bird catches the worm."

01:25:00.490 --> 01:25:02.950
"A stitch in time saves nine."

01:25:03.159 --> 01:25:06.120
"Haste makes waste."

01:25:06.287 --> 01:25:08.747
"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity."

01:25:08.915 --> 01:25:12.084
I save that one for special occasions.

01:25:12.794 --> 01:25:15.171
Holy fuck!

01:25:15.755 --> 01:25:17.882
I'm wasted.

01:25:18.091 --> 01:25:20.301
Your shit is dope!

01:25:22.303 --> 01:25:23.387
Sayid, watch it!

01:25:24.973 --> 01:25:25.890
He's a big boy!

01:25:26.099 --> 01:25:28.017
Spray cans!
- You're the can!

01:25:28.935 --> 01:25:32.438
What was that old guy
in the john trying to say?

01:25:32.605 --> 01:25:36.150
Talked about God and shitting.
What was the point?

01:25:36.317 --> 01:25:37.735
I see skinheads.

01:25:37.902 --> 01:25:39.153
You're the skinhead.

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:40.237
Fuck Nazis!

01:25:40.405 --> 01:25:42.865
The point is: God's inside you,

01:25:43.074 --> 01:25:44.617
so He helps you dump!

01:25:44.784 --> 01:25:47.077
God loves your bowels.

01:25:47.286 --> 01:25:48.370
Pass the joint.

01:25:51.749 --> 01:25:53.208
Check this shit out:

01:25:54.293 --> 01:25:58.338
"Pinhead is to skinhead, as teeny is to weenie."

01:25:58.506 --> 01:26:00.716
Get my drift?

01:26:01.008 --> 01:26:02.592
Out of the way.

01:26:12.895 --> 01:26:16.815
Vinz, Know the one about the guy
falling off a skyscraper?

01:26:17.108 --> 01:26:20.152
On the way down he says to himself:

01:26:20.319 --> 01:26:24.906
"So far so good... so far so good..."

01:26:27.576 --> 01:26:29.703
I heard it with a rabbi.

01:26:30.246 --> 01:26:34.583
Like us in the projects. So far so good,

01:26:35.126 --> 01:26:36.585
but how will we land?

01:26:37.169 --> 01:26:40.547
I feel like an ant lost in intergalactic space.

01:26:44.218 --> 01:26:46.595
Watch, I'll switch off the Eiffel Tower.

01:26:52.726 --> 01:26:54.978
That only works in movies.

01:26:55.145 --> 01:26:56.521
Mothafucka!

01:26:56.689 --> 01:26:57.940
You in a movie?

01:26:58.148 --> 01:26:59.941
In a porn flick with your mother!

01:27:00.109 --> 01:27:01.860
Look who's talking!

01:27:02.027 --> 01:27:05.363
Yours sticks carrots up her ass!

01:27:07.408 --> 01:27:09.535
You're the carrot!

01:27:18.544 --> 01:27:20.671
THE WORLD IS YOURS

01:27:32.558 --> 01:27:35.477
THE WORLD IS OURS

01:27:43.151 --> 01:27:46.904
How did they get the car in the gym?

01:27:47.072 --> 01:27:49.616
Search me... Ask God!

01:27:49.950 --> 01:27:50.533
Very funny.

01:28:00.085 --> 01:28:03.213
Look at those sheep in the system.

01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:08.384
They look cute in their fancy leather jackets.

01:28:08.552 --> 01:28:10.178
But they're scumbags.

01:28:10.345 --> 01:28:13.890
They ride escalators, carried by the system.

01:28:14.474 --> 01:28:16.809
They vote far right, but aren't racists.

01:28:16.977 --> 01:28:20.146
They can't move without escalators.

01:28:20.313 --> 01:28:21.939
The worst!

01:28:24.943 --> 01:28:26.319
Racist!

01:29:05.567 --> 01:29:07.402
WAR IN BOSNIA

01:29:15.827 --> 01:29:17.870
ABDEL ICHAHA DIES

01:29:41.811 --> 01:29:43.312
Where's Vinz?

01:29:51.279 --> 01:29:53.364
Mothafucka!

01:30:12.842 --> 01:30:13.759
What?

01:30:15.970 --> 01:30:17.221
Dumb fuck!

01:30:17.388 --> 01:30:20.307
What did I do?

01:30:22.601 --> 01:30:23.518
Why hit me?

01:30:27.356 --> 01:30:28.899
What did I do?

01:30:30.901 --> 01:30:32.652
What'd I do, asshole?

01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:34.363
You suck big time!

01:30:34.530 --> 01:30:36.114
So what'd I do?

01:30:36.282 --> 01:30:38.492
Help me, Sayid! Please.

01:30:38.659 --> 01:30:41.411
Help you what? What'd I do?

01:30:41.579 --> 01:30:42.830
Abdel's dead now!

01:30:43.038 --> 01:30:44.831
He's sick of your shit!

01:30:44.999 --> 01:30:46.083
What shit?

01:30:46.292 --> 01:30:48.377
What the fuck I do?

01:30:49.295 --> 01:30:52.965
You wanna kill a pig, go right ahead.

01:30:54.466 --> 01:30:56.176
But you're on your own.

01:30:56.427 --> 01:30:58.137
We're outta here.

01:31:02.224 --> 01:31:03.725
Get lost.

01:31:04.226 --> 01:31:05.852
Both of you!

01:31:07.479 --> 01:31:10.148
I don't need you!

01:31:13.527 --> 01:31:16.571
I know who I am and where I come from!

01:31:16.738 --> 01:31:19.198
So go home and shut up!

01:31:19.366 --> 01:31:21.743
Fuck your mother!

01:31:38.802 --> 01:31:40.136
Don't bug me, Sayid.

01:31:40.304 --> 01:31:41.930
Think we should've...

01:31:45.559 --> 01:31:46.893
Just what we need!

01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:48.227
A nigger!

01:31:49.688 --> 01:31:52.899
You're the fucker who dissed us from the roof!

01:31:53.066 --> 01:31:55.193
The gang banger from the roof?

01:31:55.402 --> 01:31:58.071
Let's see you fight!

01:32:01.825 --> 01:32:03.243
Hold him!

01:32:08.081 --> 01:32:10.625
Come back!

01:32:10.834 --> 01:32:12.544
You fuckin' asshole!

01:32:12.711 --> 01:32:13.711
I done nothing!

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.588
Faster than a speeding bullet?

01:32:15.755 --> 01:32:18.048
I done nothing!

01:32:18.758 --> 01:32:20.009
Check it out!

01:32:21.595 --> 01:32:22.846
Whadda you say?

01:32:31.688 --> 01:32:33.981
Get the fuck in there!

01:32:44.075 --> 01:32:45.534
Whatcha gonna do?

01:32:47.829 --> 01:32:49.664
You think I'm all talk?

01:32:49.831 --> 01:32:51.832
I'm all talk?

01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:57.755
Watch! Don't try and stop me!

01:32:59.090 --> 01:33:01.425
Vinz, don't do it!
- Let him!

01:33:02.719 --> 01:33:04.345
Do your good deed!

01:33:05.096 --> 01:33:06.096
Shut up!

01:33:06.848 --> 01:33:08.307
There are good cops.

01:33:08.474 --> 01:33:11.476
But the only good skinhead is a dead one!

01:33:11.978 --> 01:33:13.479
Shoot him.

01:33:13.646 --> 01:33:16.982
We took your shit all day. Fuckin' shoot him!

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:18.943
You got the piece.

01:33:22.947 --> 01:33:24.198
Shoot!

01:33:26.826 --> 01:33:27.451
Shoot!

01:33:32.165 --> 01:33:33.624
Fuck his mother!

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.084
Shoot!

01:33:38.421 --> 01:33:41.674
Abdel's dead! Get even, for fuck's sake!

01:33:41.841 --> 01:33:43.634
Do it for Abdel!

01:33:47.889 --> 01:33:48.889
Shoot!

01:33:59.275 --> 01:34:01.276
Get outta here!

01:34:30.222 --> 01:34:31.765
See ya tomorrow.

01:34:44.987 --> 01:34:46.238
Take it.

01:34:50.492 --> 01:34:52.160
Gonna sing a love song?

01:34:52.328 --> 01:34:53.704
Go home, loser.

01:34:53.871 --> 01:34:56.915
Let's go, Vinz.

01:34:57.124 --> 01:34:58.542
Later, Hubert.

01:34:59.418 --> 01:35:01.336
Hear the one about the nun?

01:35:01.503 --> 01:35:03.963
This drunk guy comes out of a bar,

01:35:04.173 --> 01:35:07.676
and walks up to a nun in this big black cape.

01:35:07.843 --> 01:35:11.471
Wham! He slugs her in her teeth. She goes down

01:35:11.638 --> 01:35:14.307
and he keeps on pounding her.

01:35:16.059 --> 01:35:18.311
After about 5 minutes he stops,

01:35:18.687 --> 01:35:21.064
looks at her and says:

01:35:21.273 --> 01:35:23.274
"You're not so tough, Batman!"

01:35:23.442 --> 01:35:25.652
That's a killer!

01:35:25.986 --> 01:35:28.029
He thought the nun was Batman!

01:35:28.196 --> 01:35:30.406
I heard it with a rabbi.

01:35:31.491 --> 01:35:32.491
Over here, you!

01:35:32.909 --> 01:35:34.285
What's the matter?

01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:36.121
I know you!

01:35:38.874 --> 01:35:40.375
You were on the roof!

01:35:52.095 --> 01:35:53.679
What're you doin'?

01:35:55.474 --> 01:35:57.350
Got a problem, you fuck?

01:35:57.851 --> 01:35:59.852
Scared without your pals?

01:36:00.770 --> 01:36:02.271
Not so tough now!

01:36:02.439 --> 01:36:04.732
Look at him!

01:36:31.885 --> 01:36:34.137
It's about a society falling...

01:36:34.304 --> 01:36:38.516
On the way down it keeps telling itself:

01:36:38.808 --> 01:36:40.643
"So far so good...

01:36:41.519 --> 01:36:43.312
"so far so good...

01:36:44.272 --> 01:36:46.399
"so far so good..."

01:36:47.901 --> 01:36:49.902
How you fall doesn't matter.

01:36:51.488 --> 01:36:53.156
It's how you land!
