WEBVTT

00:07.799 --> 00:11.011
I don't even know why we're doing this.
I've already got a shirt for work.

00:11.094 --> 00:14.515
You need more than one outfit, Jase.
You're not a cartoon character.

00:15.766 --> 00:16.767
You're a manager now.

00:16.850 --> 00:20.145
You can't go to work dressed in
the same shirt you buried your uncle in.

00:20.229 --> 00:23.357
And we can't sit at home
waiting for news about James.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.109
As soon as you forget,
the thing that you're waiting for happens.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.194
Everyone knows that.

00:27.277 --> 00:30.113
I don't wanna be one of those people
who sells out as soon as they make it.

00:30.197 --> 00:33.951
I become a manager and
then suddenly I'm wearing a £34 shirt,

00:34.034 --> 00:35.494
like I forgot where I came from.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.538
Jase, this is not Dylan going electric.

00:37.621 --> 00:40.999
This is you looking smart
on your first day after promotion.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.461
Oh, no, it's just Karen.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.172
She's asked me
to go wedding dress shopping.

00:47.256 --> 00:49.383
She never asks me to do things like that.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.468
Right, I need to nail this.

00:51.552 --> 00:55.013
Maybe I should take the morning off work
tomorrow to do a mood board.

00:56.014 --> 00:59.226
No, that's crazy. I'll just do
a couple of hours when I get in tonight.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.687
-Oh, look! This is nice.
-Yeah.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.230
-That's lovely.
-You like that? Let's have a look.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.275
Yeah. That's all right, actually, innit?

01:06.358 --> 01:07.901
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I don't--

01:07.985 --> 01:09.570
-No, hang on a second.
-Yeah?

01:09.653 --> 01:11.321
-Those are little ducks.
-I know.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.157
-No, no. I thought they were dots.
-No, they're little ducks.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.827
Nikki, my dad's from Dagenham.
He left school when he was 16.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.705
-I can't wear a shirt with ducks on it.
-No, they're nice ducks.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.790
I'm gonna spend the whole day making sure
people don't get close enough

01:21.874 --> 01:24.001
to see they're not dots but little ducks.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.879
-It's a lot of extra stress I don't need.
-I'm sorry. We're gonna get it.

01:26.962 --> 01:30.257
It makes you look grown-up. It makes you
look like a manager, like a dad.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.968
-Yeah, but I wanna be a cool dad.
-No. No, no.

01:33.051 --> 01:35.929
No one wants cool parents.
My friend Cecile had cool parents,

01:36.013 --> 01:38.348
and she had to do her homework
on a mini trampoline

01:38.432 --> 01:41.518
because her mum sold her kitchen table
to pay for a clowning workshop.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.645
We're just-- We're gonna be boring, okay?

01:43.729 --> 01:45.105
-For James.
-Hey.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.859
You know it's not definite
that we're getting him, don't you?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.569
-Yes, yes.
-Yeah?

01:50.652 --> 01:54.198
No, I know. It's just...
I've got a good feeling about it.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.407
Let's have a look.

01:57.492 --> 01:58.785
-Yeah. All right, then.
-Yeah?

01:58.869 --> 02:01.371
Is that the-- Yeah, right size.
Let's do it. Okay.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.040
-I think it's nice.
-Okay.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.792
Mate,
just so as you know, they're little ducks.

02:05.876 --> 02:09.420
They made 'em really small so they look
like dots, but they're not. They're ducks.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.089
FYI.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.042
-Hello.
-All right.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.126
Hi.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.545
Any news on James?

02:49.628 --> 02:52.130
No, not yet,
but we're hoping to hear today, so...

02:52.214 --> 02:53.590
-Okay.
-Okay, so...

02:53.674 --> 02:56.343
I don't wanna get crazy with this

02:56.426 --> 02:57.511
like some people do.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.264
No. Yeah, no. Of course not.

03:00.931 --> 03:04.017
It's not like I've had
a vision of this day since I was a kid.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.519
I'm not that sort of woman.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.229
You know, I don't even wear perfume.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.940
I just smell like whoever's shirt
I bought from the charity shop.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.900
It's fine. It's just a dress.
Just a dress.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.610
Okay.

03:15.779 --> 03:16.780
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, God.

03:16.864 --> 03:17.990
What she come as?

03:18.740 --> 03:19.950
-Hello.
-Hello.

03:21.159 --> 03:25.831
-Hello, muffin. Is this smart enough?
-What, to go to a shop? Yes, Mum.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.916
Yeah, but it is posh, though, isn't it?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.878
If it's not smart enough,
I'm really happy to stand outside.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.755
-Oh, don't be daft.
-You're not standing outside.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.967
-You been doing some painting?
-What?

03:37.968 --> 03:39.261
No, it's my shirt.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.971
-Should we go?
-Oh, Jesus.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.556
Come on. Let's go.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.224
-Where is it?
-Okay. It's just there.

03:44.308 --> 03:45.350
Oh, fantastic.

03:58.197 --> 03:59.823
Hi, guys.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.495
Sweets there. So, everyone-- Okay.

04:06.205 --> 04:08.624
So, guys. Wha-- Guys.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.627
Come on, guys. Listen up a sec, please.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.005
Lads!

04:21.928 --> 04:23.263
The Wicked Witch is dead.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.518
And finally, the townspeople are free.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.687
No, no, seriously, though.

04:31.522 --> 04:34.191
I've got a few things
that I want to talk about.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.859
A few boring things. Get them out the way.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.111
So I'm gonna put on
my little manager's hat.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.661
Written a few things down.
Oh, hang on a sec.

04:54.878 --> 04:58.215
Right, anyway. Yeah. So, back to it.

04:59.132 --> 05:03.971
All of your schedules should now be synced
to the online diary, so please read.

05:04.054 --> 05:07.140
Mate, if I didn't read Anne Frank's diary
for my GCSEs,

05:07.224 --> 05:09.852
what chance have you got?
Do you know what I mean?

05:09.935 --> 05:12.271
Nice one. Nice one.

05:12.771 --> 05:16.608
No, no-- Seriously, though.
Seriously do have a read.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.778
Okay, I wanna talk about
lesson planning, because it--

05:20.571 --> 05:23.198
Sorry. I've just got to... Yeah.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.535
-Hello.
-Any news?

05:26.618 --> 05:29.496
-I'm in a meeting.
-Okay, you sure you got a signal?

05:29.580 --> 05:31.832
I'm in London,
and I'm on the phone to you, so--

05:32.916 --> 05:34.585
Kaia, those are for everyone. Okay?

05:34.668 --> 05:37.504
-Are you sure your phone's fully charged?
-It was, but you keep calling me.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.842
-Jack, mate.
-Come on.

05:44.636 --> 05:45.596
Listen, I've got to go.

05:46.805 --> 05:47.848
Come on.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.474
Yes. Sorry, sorry. Sorry.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.311
Guys, so what I was saying about less--

05:52.394 --> 05:54.771
All right. Okay,
let's just do this one, and then we'll...

05:56.773 --> 05:59.526
Hey! All right, let's-- Have a seat now.

05:59.610 --> 06:00.903
Everyone stop...

06:12.831 --> 06:15.667
Astra, Sienna, Lavinia.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.337
All these dresses sound like people

06:18.420 --> 06:20.506
that would have been a bitch to me
at school.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.009
This is all too nice. I should go.

06:24.092 --> 06:26.762
-Would you like a drink?
-Bubbly?

06:28.388 --> 06:30.390
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

06:30.474 --> 06:31.767
-Very nice.
-I wasn't expecting this.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.977
-Cheers to you.
-Cheers.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.729
Yeah, no. No fuss.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.397
All right, ladies. How we doing?

06:37.481 --> 06:38.524
-Hello.
-Daryl.

06:38.607 --> 06:39.608
-Hi.
-All right?

06:40.567 --> 06:43.487
My wife's ill.
Sorry, I'm not usually here, so...

06:43.570 --> 06:46.907
I don't really know about all the dresses
and that, but I'll give it a whirl.

06:47.366 --> 06:49.326
I'm exhausts mainly, yeah.

06:49.952 --> 06:52.079
Yeah, she was gonna shut,
but to be honest,

06:52.162 --> 06:54.748
it's ten exhausts to one of these,

06:55.332 --> 06:58.168
so shut the garage instead.
You know what I mean?

06:58.252 --> 07:00.128
Yeah, so go on. Who's getting married?

07:00.212 --> 07:01.213
-Karen.
-My daughter.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.382
All right. Yeah, nice. Congratulations.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.050
-And what's your fella's name?
-Scott.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.802
Scott? That's my middle name.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.722
-How funny.
-Funny.

07:10.806 --> 07:13.267
What are chances of that?
That's magic. Brilliant.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.269
Right.

07:15.352 --> 07:18.146
So... you know, style-wise, what ya--

07:18.230 --> 07:19.898
What are you gonna go for then?

07:19.982 --> 07:23.026
Well, just don't wanna look shit.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.196
Okay, yeah. No, fair play, fair play.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.447
Melinda.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.617
The steer is "not shit."

07:30.701 --> 07:32.494
-Sure, we can do that.
-Thanks, love.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.329
-Would you like to follow me?
-Go on, Karen.

07:34.413 --> 07:35.873
Go on. Enjoy yourself.

07:37.416 --> 07:38.667
She'll have a nice time.

07:52.181 --> 07:56.185
-"A structured applique bodice"--
-Yeah, I don't like it.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.561
Okay.

07:58.228 --> 08:02.774
Yeah, I do prefer the ones
with the... long bit.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.402
-Sleeves?
-Yeah, sleeves. That's it, yeah.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.904
Yeah, sleeves.

08:10.908 --> 08:14.995
"The classic A-line is a tiered chiffon
which drapes effortlessly"...

08:15.078 --> 08:16.371
-No!
-It's...

08:20.542 --> 08:22.544
-Off she goes again.
-Yeah.

08:28.926 --> 08:31.303
-So is your wife very poorly then?
-Yeah, yeah.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.263
Yeah. Both ends. Bless her. Yeah.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.394
Here we go. Look at that.
That's the business.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.313
-Karen.
-I like it.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.732
-Yeah. It's nice with that.
-Yeah.

08:43.815 --> 08:48.070
Cinderella once said,
"A dream is a wish your heart makes."

08:48.862 --> 08:50.030
So, you know.

08:50.113 --> 08:54.076
I don't know. It's fine.
How am I supposed to feel?

08:54.159 --> 08:56.745
Well, Carol says when it's the one,
you cry. That's how you know.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.622
Well, I haven't cried since 2012.

08:59.248 --> 09:02.334
I don't sort of tend to go,
but when I go, like--

09:02.417 --> 09:04.253
-I'll go, do you know what I mean?
-Do ya?

09:04.336 --> 09:05.337
Yeah.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.340
-Take your watch off.
-Why?

09:08.423 --> 09:11.552
You don't wear a Casio watch
with a £2,000 wedding dress.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.387
Well, how will I know what time it is?

09:13.470 --> 09:17.015
It's your wedding day.
People will tell you the time.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.811
That's why brides
don't get to the church on time.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.438
People literally
taking their watches off them.

09:23.522 --> 09:24.815
Don't touch me.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.693
Is it her first wedding?

09:27.776 --> 09:29.194
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

09:29.278 --> 09:31.572
Oh, it is. Right, yeah.
Yeah, it's the best one, innit?

09:33.323 --> 09:35.242
Come on, come on, come on.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.244
Yeah!

09:43.292 --> 09:44.293
Yeah!

09:45.502 --> 09:47.171
Okay. All right, please.

09:47.254 --> 09:53.218
-Forty. We're gonna make it forty.
-Forty, forty, forty, forty, forty, forty.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.933
Okay. All right. So--

10:00.017 --> 10:02.895
Oh, no. Hang on, don't leave. We've
still got lots of things to get through.

10:02.978 --> 10:06.648
Guys. Guys, there's lots to get through
still-- you can't--

10:06.732 --> 10:08.066
Do you know what that was about?

10:08.150 --> 10:10.444
Why hold a meeting
if you've got nothing to say?

10:24.666 --> 10:25.709
Bloody hell.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.172
I'm having a lovely time.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.761
Do you know, I've always
sort of wanted to be in a women's prison.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.848
There's so much camaraderie, et cetera.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.144
What about this?

10:44.728 --> 10:46.063
-Oh, no.
-No.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.615
Do you think she's happy?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.368
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

11:01.495 --> 11:02.829
You were always happy.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.290
Well, in your way.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.503
I just want to see her smile.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.800
Any news?

11:15.384 --> 11:16.635
No, not yet.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.137
I've a good feeling, though.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.561
What's it like?

11:25.644 --> 11:26.687
What?

11:27.229 --> 11:29.147
To have kids. To have all of this.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.485
It's like the sun on your back.

11:41.034 --> 11:45.080
-You know, I kissed a girl once.
-Okay. All right.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.126
-This one's not bad.
-Come on.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.879
We're coming. We're coming.

11:51.962 --> 11:53.380
Yeah.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.215
-We're coming.
-We're coming.

12:01.597 --> 12:02.806
Karen.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.309
-That's beautiful.
-Yeah.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.769
-It is.
-Is it?

12:07.853 --> 12:10.689
Yeah. Yeah, it is, yeah.
It's banging, that is.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.442
-Innit? Yeah. It's ab--
-Yeah.

12:13.525 --> 12:14.985
It's absolutely banging.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.739
-I'm going, aren't I?
-Yeah.

12:20.741 --> 12:21.950
Come here.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.963
Bloody hell! Three grand?

12:38.467 --> 12:40.802
If I ask you for some management advice,

12:41.428 --> 12:43.805
is there any chance of you
not being smug and annoying?

12:43.889 --> 12:46.391
-Mate, of course.
-Freddy.

12:50.521 --> 12:51.980
-Sure?
-I'm sure.

12:52.064 --> 12:55.108
Okay. All right. So what do I do?

12:55.859 --> 12:58.487
Well. Here's the thing.
Good managers are born.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.489
Can't learn how to be a manager.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.742
-Learned that at management school.
-Smug and annoying.

13:04.368 --> 13:06.703
-Hey, Jase.
-Hiya. Little hug. Okay.

13:06.787 --> 13:07.955
There you go.

13:08.038 --> 13:09.581
You're so British.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.709
-Any news on James?
-No. Hopefully today or tomorrow.

13:12.793 --> 13:13.836
Want some caraway seed bread?

13:13.919 --> 13:16.380
-No, thanks. I'm trying to give it up.
-No, try.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.464
Yeah?

13:17.548 --> 13:20.759
All right. Just as is? Okay.

13:22.553 --> 13:23.679
-Oh, my God.
-I know.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.347
I tell you what, that is-- Yeah.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.392
I'm obsessed with it. It's the main reason
I can't afford to buy an apartment.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.103
-What's going on?
-Jason can't handle his staff.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.729
No, it's not that. It's tricky.

13:32.813 --> 13:35.482
Because it's--
Because they're my friends as well.

13:35.566 --> 13:37.276
Yeah, well, that shit doesn't work.

13:37.943 --> 13:39.611
You can't be their friend
if you're their boss.

13:39.695 --> 13:40.529
Why not?

13:40.612 --> 13:42.447
Well, because people like
to hate their bosses.

13:42.531 --> 13:43.532
Not all the time.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.993
-Did you hate your last boss?
-Yeah, but it was different 'cause we--

13:46.076 --> 13:47.995
Look,
we go to the pub and things like that.

13:48.078 --> 13:51.248
Yeah, well, you shouldn't
because they go there to talk about you.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.584
Look, you're the pilot,
they're the passengers.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.003
How'd you feel if the pilot
stopped flying the plane,

13:56.086 --> 13:59.339
came and sat next to you, and started
eating a tiny bag of peanuts, huh?

13:59.423 --> 14:03.635
You'd freak out. 'Cause then you're asking
yourself, "Who's flying this plane?"

14:05.929 --> 14:08.265
You're a grown-ass man.
Not everyone needs to like you.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.433
Yeah, okay.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.976
Okay, ready in 20?

14:11.602 --> 14:13.729
-Yeah.
-It's gonna be a big one.

14:13.812 --> 14:16.315
-The Bolivians are gonna come.
-All of them?

14:16.398 --> 14:17.900
Oh, yeah.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.443
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.278
Great. Clever.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.655
-How's it going, mate?
-Yeah, it's great. It's great.

14:23.739 --> 14:24.907
-I am knackered.
-Yeah?

14:24.990 --> 14:26.533
We got in at 4:00 this morning,

14:26.617 --> 14:29.786
and we were up at 7:00 to go and
help her friend move flat in Walthamstow.

14:29.870 --> 14:30.871
Oh, no.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.082
She's just so perky and undefeated.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.419
It's like her shoulders haven't dropped
yet. When does that happen?

14:37.503 --> 14:40.088
Twenty-nine in the city,
32 in the smaller towns.

14:40.172 --> 14:41.507
Right. Good.

14:47.763 --> 14:48.764
Hello.

14:50.307 --> 14:52.267
-What? When?
-Go, go, go.

14:52.351 --> 14:53.477
All right, I'm coming.

14:54.144 --> 14:56.063
-I'm coming. See ya, mate.
-Good luck.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.907
Did they give a reason at all?

15:08.784 --> 15:10.369
You can say.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.913
Like if they felt
that Jason didn't sell himself

15:12.996 --> 15:14.623
or that he looked too stern in the photo.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.792
-All me then, yeah?
-No, okay, sorry, no, it--

15:16.875 --> 15:18.669
Yeah, it could be me.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.546
Maybe they thought
I looked too young to be a mum.

15:20.629 --> 15:21.630
Okay.

15:21.713 --> 15:26.426
They chose another couple who already
had a child of a similar age to James.

15:26.510 --> 15:27.553
Okay.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.557
Well, I mean,
that hardly seems very fair, does it,

15:31.640 --> 15:33.433
considering they already have one.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.146
No, that's-- That makes sense.

15:38.689 --> 15:41.900
It's nice that he'll have
a brother or sister to play with, so...

15:42.442 --> 15:44.528
that's the best outcome really, isn't it?

15:45.195 --> 15:49.616
Look, I know you were all in, but this
is not the last chopper out of Saigon.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.159
So what happens next?

15:51.243 --> 15:53.328
Well, when things don't
just fall into place,

15:53.412 --> 15:56.582
we just have to jiggle the key
in the lock a little bit. Yeah?

15:56.665 --> 16:01.086
So, how would you like to meet some kids?

16:01.587 --> 16:03.714
Yeah? Yeah, great.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bring it on.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.632
Yeah, no,
I think we'd really pop in person.

16:05.716 --> 16:08.010
-Tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

16:09.845 --> 16:11.763
"Adoption Activity Day."

16:11.847 --> 16:15.142
Every six months or so, we get
all the kids we haven't found homes for

16:15.225 --> 16:18.270
and all the people looking for kids and
smoosh them together in a big party

16:18.353 --> 16:19.605
and see what happens.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.648
It's a worrying indictment
of a broken system,

16:21.732 --> 16:23.650
but there is cake, so we plod on.

16:23.734 --> 16:25.402
How many kids are we talking here?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.529
25 or so. Budget for a migraine.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.282
Actually,
I have the same approach to dating.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.201
Group them all together
like a flat viewing.

16:32.284 --> 16:35.287
Saves time, 'cause men my age
are rapidly losing their looks.

16:35.370 --> 16:38.624
Luckily, I'm only gradually losing mine,
so it's advantage Penny.

16:39.291 --> 16:42.586
Okay, so basically
we have two hours to bond with a child

16:42.669 --> 16:45.047
and get them to like us...

16:45.714 --> 16:47.341
in fancy dress. Wow.

16:47.424 --> 16:50.719
Oh, yeah. The theme is,
"What I want to be when I grow up."

16:52.054 --> 16:53.680
-So think on, you know?
-Okay.

16:53.764 --> 16:56.892
No. Don't worry, please. It's just a bit
of football in a park with some kids.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.810
Football?
Just a bit of football in the p--

16:58.894 --> 17:00.103
-That's good. Yeah, it's fine.
-Yeah.

17:00.187 --> 17:03.482
Yeah, don't race ahead, okay,
and overinvest emotionally.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.651
Oh, God, no.
We've not been doing that. Have we?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.236
-No. God, no. No, no, no.
-No.

17:18.163 --> 17:19.915
Sometimes you just miss someone in time.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.710
I know.

17:23.794 --> 17:25.628
It's a bit like breaking up with someone.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.382
You've just got to, you know,
you've got to move on.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.677
Yeah, no, I don't really do that.

17:32.427 --> 17:35.305
I'm still friends with
everyone I've ever slept with, so...

17:35.389 --> 17:36.849
Okay, that's unsettling.

17:49.862 --> 17:51.280
What are we gonna do about costumes?

17:51.363 --> 17:53.699
Oh, yeah. Well, what did you wanna be
when you're older?

17:53.782 --> 17:58.287
I wanted to be working
on the phones in a car rental firm. So...

17:58.370 --> 18:00.038
-There you go.
-Absolutely nailed that.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.332
-Boom.
-Thank you very much. What about you?

18:02.416 --> 18:04.001
-My dad's friend Michael.
-Oh, yeah?

18:04.084 --> 18:07.421
Yeah. He was so fun when I was a kid.

18:07.504 --> 18:12.134
But then I got older and I realized
that he was just an alcoholic. Yeah.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.385
Okay.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.596
Yeah, he's dead now. Bless him.

18:16.430 --> 18:18.265
Drunk himself to death, he did.

18:23.562 --> 18:24.688
Are we okay?

18:27.441 --> 18:28.650
Yeah.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.780
The kids are gonna like us, aren't they?

18:33.864 --> 18:35.115
Yes.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.077
Penny's right.
We just-- We shouldn't overthink it.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.829
-Yeah.
-We're going to kick a football around

18:40.913 --> 18:41.914
with some kids.

18:41.997 --> 18:43.165
Yeah.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.611
Oh, shit.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.882
Okay, we've got 20 minutes,
so we just need to be in and out.

19:33.966 --> 19:35.342
Yeah, no bother. I know what I want.

19:37.302 --> 19:39.638
-Here, what about this?
-No.

19:41.265 --> 19:43.517
Nothing here is appropriate.

19:44.726 --> 19:47.145
Is there any animal they can't sexify?

19:47.229 --> 19:49.398
Armadillo? That's the one we can't crack.

19:50.566 --> 19:52.401
Excuse me. Hiya.

19:53.277 --> 19:57.573
Do you have any costumes for women
that are more positive role models?

19:58.824 --> 20:00.701
We got role-play, up there on the left.

20:00.784 --> 20:05.163
No. I mean, the theme is
what you wanna be when you grow up.

20:05.247 --> 20:09.334
So something like businessperson
or doctor, lawyer.

20:09.418 --> 20:11.336
Yeah, that sort of thing.

20:11.420 --> 20:12.421
We got a judge.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.965
Yes. Perfect.

20:18.927 --> 20:20.345
This is so bad.

20:22.598 --> 20:23.640
Yeah.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.394
No, I'm sorry.
I can't go dressed like this.

20:28.187 --> 20:29.354
Look, you--

20:30.522 --> 20:33.650
No, all right. Okay.
What about a princess?

20:33.734 --> 20:35.194
Princesses are very successful.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.154
Have you seen a real-life princess, Jase?
They're miserable.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.114
Not all girls wanna be princesses.

20:39.198 --> 20:41.909
The last thing
I'd want for a daughter is a princess.

20:42.993 --> 20:46.079
Is there anything in this shop
that is not demeaning to women?

20:50.792 --> 20:52.920
-I'm a bit nervous.
-What's that?

20:53.921 --> 20:56.173
I said I'm a bit nervous.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.300
-Yeah. I know.
-And hot.

20:58.383 --> 21:00.260
Imagine being inside this in Kenya.

21:02.596 --> 21:03.597
I was thinking,

21:03.680 --> 21:06.391
I might show them some of
my martial arts moves to impress 'em.

21:06.475 --> 21:08.936
-From when you were a teenager?
-Yeah. What do you reckon?

21:09.019 --> 21:10.020
Show me.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.189
-Okay. Just hold that a second.
-I'll have the hat.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.191
So, you would be...

21:37.506 --> 21:38.715
Are you making this up?

21:38.799 --> 21:41.009
No, it's--
I've forgotten quite a lot of it.

21:41.093 --> 21:43.220
But that's potentially good,

21:43.303 --> 21:45.722
because if I don't know what's next,
then neither do my opponents.

21:45.806 --> 21:46.807
-Yeah.
-So...

21:47.808 --> 21:48.809
I'd leave it.

21:51.311 --> 21:53.355
-Can I have my hat?
-Yeah, your hat.

22:04.575 --> 22:07.244
See, I knew we'd be
the only ones in fancy dress.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.161
-Good.
-Yeah, but--

22:08.245 --> 22:09.955
-We'll be memorable.
-Yeah.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.502
-We should probably go speak to a kid.
-Yeah.

22:16.670 --> 22:18.130
Look, he's on his own.

22:18.213 --> 22:20.340
Yeah. All right, quick,
before someone else gets to him.

22:23.802 --> 22:24.803
Hello.

22:24.887 --> 22:26.680
-Hello, mate. You all right?
-Hi.

22:26.763 --> 22:29.016
-Hi.
-I'm Nikki. This is Jason.

22:29.099 --> 22:30.100
Hiya.

22:30.184 --> 22:31.894
-What's your name?
-Ethan.

22:31.977 --> 22:36.398
-Hi, Ethan. Who's this?
-He's my friend.

22:39.109 --> 22:40.277
Do you know why we're here?

22:41.695 --> 22:45.032
We're here to play with you
and for you to see if you like us.

22:45.699 --> 22:46.533
Why?

22:47.576 --> 22:51.413
Well, so that you can maybe come back
to our house and live with us.

22:51.496 --> 22:52.915
No.

22:52.998 --> 22:55.000
Oh, no. It's all right, mate.
Not straightaway.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.794
-No, no, no.
-Ethan?

22:57.878 --> 23:00.464
It's okay. No, we didn't do anything.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.551
Happy Birthday to you

23:04.635 --> 23:09.056
Happy Birthday to you

23:09.139 --> 23:10.599
Happy Birthday...

23:10.682 --> 23:12.017
-Oh, shit.
-Okay.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.770
-I don't want to go.
-We should-- Sorry. Sorry about that.

23:14.853 --> 23:16.813
-Sorry, sorry.
-Yeah, sorry about that.

23:17.856 --> 23:20.400
-You said this was the right place.
-Yes, I thought it was.

23:20.484 --> 23:23.195
-Cumberland Gate.
-No, this is Cumberland Green.

23:23.987 --> 23:25.155
Well, we must be close.

23:25.239 --> 23:27.574
No, no. No, Cumberland Gate
is in Hyde Park, Nikki.

23:27.658 --> 23:30.494
-This is Regent's Park.
-Oh, shit.

23:30.577 --> 23:32.996
-Okay. Can you run in that?
-Yes.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.540
All right, come on. Let's go.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.504
Bus. Jase.

23:47.261 --> 23:49.263
Thank you. Thank you.

23:52.808 --> 23:53.809
It's fine. Look.

23:53.892 --> 23:56.019
-We're gonna make it, all right? Just.
-Okay.

23:58.897 --> 24:00.274
-It's all right. It's all right.
-Oh, God.

24:00.357 --> 24:01.608
We'll get there.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.238
Bonjour. Marble Arch.

24:06.947 --> 24:08.991
Which Marble Arch, mate? Tube or not tube?

24:13.161 --> 24:15.706
Do you want Marble Arch tube?

24:17.416 --> 24:19.668
Tube? Station?

24:19.751 --> 24:21.920
-Come on. Bloody hell.
-Oh, my God.

24:22.004 --> 24:27.676
No, Marble Arch.
The bâtiment with the marble inside.

24:28.969 --> 24:29.803
Okay, fine.

24:29.887 --> 24:31.722
-Hiya.
-Hello, where are you trying to get to?

24:31.805 --> 24:32.931
-Marble Arch.
-Marble Arch.

24:33.015 --> 24:36.643
Marble Arch? Why would you wanna go see
Marble-- Marble Arch is shit. It's tiny.

24:36.727 --> 24:38.270
Everyone knows that. Where you from?

24:39.021 --> 24:40.022
Paris.

24:40.105 --> 24:43.400
Paris? You've come from Paris
to see Marble Arch? Are you insane?

24:43.483 --> 24:46.737
Just stand further away from
the Arc de Triomphe. That's Marble Arch.

24:46.820 --> 24:48.655
Marble Arch.

24:48.739 --> 24:50.073
-Oh, my God.
-Come on. Let's go.

24:51.325 --> 24:52.784
Marble Arch.

24:53.577 --> 24:55.120
Cumberland Gate, okay.

24:56.622 --> 24:57.623
Which way?

24:57.706 --> 24:58.916
-Over here.
-Yeah?

25:03.712 --> 25:06.507
-Why are they clapping us?
-They think we're on a bloody fun run.

25:09.551 --> 25:10.969
-Hello, mate. Hiya.
-Hey. Hi.

25:11.053 --> 25:12.721
Can you get us
to the other side of the park, please?

25:12.804 --> 25:15.933
No, mate. Look, don't give up.
You're nearly there.

25:16.016 --> 25:18.352
-Go on. You can make it.
-We're not part of the fun run.

25:18.435 --> 25:21.939
Look, I can't help people cheat.
It wouldn't be fair on all the others.

25:22.022 --> 25:23.440
-Yeah, but we're not part of--
-No, no, no.

25:23.524 --> 25:25.692
-I'm not helping cheats. No way.
-Come on.

25:28.737 --> 25:30.697
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

25:30.781 --> 25:33.450
-Sorry. Sorry.
-Cheers, mate.

25:44.044 --> 25:46.672
-Hello.
-Hi. Where were you?

25:46.755 --> 25:48.423
-Are there any children left?
-What?

25:48.507 --> 25:50.801
-Children.
-I don't think so.

25:55.305 --> 25:57.975
Well-- It's okay.

25:58.559 --> 26:00.185
We met the most amazing little girl.

26:00.269 --> 26:04.731
We spent all afternoon together.
I think she really liked us. And...

26:04.815 --> 26:07.818
-Nikki.
-She was... really lovely.

26:08.610 --> 26:09.987
Nikki.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.198
Sorry. She--

26:43.270 --> 26:46.231
There you are.
You got me worried there for a minute.

26:49.234 --> 26:51.820
-Should we go back to the bus?
-I need to get my bag.

26:51.904 --> 26:53.864
Oh. Come on then. Let's go get it.

26:59.077 --> 27:00.579
-Okay. Let me take your badge.
-Okay.

27:00.662 --> 27:02.581
I'll be right back. I won't be a sec.

27:11.006 --> 27:12.633
Some of them just aren't ready.

27:15.886 --> 27:18.430
-All right, sweetie. Come on. Let's go.
-Okay.

27:41.036 --> 27:42.246
Hey.

27:44.498 --> 27:45.749
What are you crying for?

27:51.213 --> 27:52.506
Because when it's the one...

27:54.508 --> 27:55.676
...you cry.

29:12.044 --> 29:13.253
Happy?

29:13.754 --> 29:14.880
Yeah.

29:17.090 --> 29:19.801
Then why have you got your head
in your hands?

29:21.887 --> 29:23.597
Shut up.
