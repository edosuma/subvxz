00:00.001 --> 00:02.299
Hey, Danny, how far
is the party, anyway?

00:02.300 --> 00:04.301
Hey, you sure this
is the right way?

00:04.335 --> 00:07.170
We're getting close.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.634
This party better
be worth it, dude.

00:14.668 --> 00:16.969
These parties are always awesome.

00:22.572 --> 00:25.488
You sure you know
where we're going?

00:26.800 --> 00:28.233
I'm telling you this is faster.

00:28.268 --> 00:30.569
The quarry is right
up here on the right.

00:33.239 --> 00:34.440
Greg, you comin'?

00:34.474 --> 00:36.575
I heard something.

00:36.609 --> 00:37.743
What?

00:37.777 --> 00:39.711
I thought I saw something moving.

00:39.746 --> 00:41.413
It's probably just a raccoon.

00:41.448 --> 00:43.749
Shh. Did you hear that?

00:49.055 --> 00:52.591
Let's just get to the party
before everybody leaves.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:04.637 --> 01:06.939
What the...

01:06.973 --> 01:09.174
Whoa.

01:09.209 --> 01:11.043
That's not the quarry. Ok, great.

01:11.077 --> 01:13.779
So it's official.
We're lost, aren't we?

01:13.813 --> 01:16.448
They're all gonna be gone, man.

01:16.483 --> 01:18.317
I've hiked out here a lot.

01:18.351 --> 01:20.152
Which is why we followed you.

01:20.186 --> 01:21.320
I screwed up.

01:21.354 --> 01:23.989
All I'm saying is I never
saw this place before.

01:27.794 --> 01:28.694
Hmm.

01:28.728 --> 01:30.729
Let's go...

01:30.763 --> 01:32.064
Check it out.

01:38.538 --> 01:39.972
Oh, great, now it's raining.

01:40.006 --> 01:41.773
Looks abandoned.

01:44.077 --> 01:45.410
Ahh, damn. Oh, crap.

01:45.445 --> 01:47.112
What is this?

01:47.147 --> 01:49.581
Who dug all these
holes in the ground?

01:49.616 --> 01:51.950
Probably some kind
of trap or somethin'.

01:51.985 --> 01:54.153
Somebody was looking
for something.

01:54.187 --> 01:55.621
Like what?

01:55.655 --> 01:58.157
Something they really
wanted to find.

01:58.191 --> 01:59.625
Look at all these.

01:59.659 --> 02:02.060
There's something hidden here,
something valuable.

02:02.095 --> 02:04.296
Has to be, right?

02:04.330 --> 02:06.498
Maybe it's inside.

02:22.916 --> 02:24.249
Come on.

02:43.303 --> 02:44.203
Go that way.

02:44.237 --> 02:46.071
Let's split up and
see what's here.

03:29.148 --> 03:30.649
You guys hear me?

03:34.187 --> 03:36.054
Scott. Danny.

03:37.457 --> 03:40.125
Come on, you guys.
I heard you moving around.

03:51.371 --> 03:53.071
Aah! Unh!

03:53.106 --> 03:55.907
Guys, what just happened?
Come on. Who screamed?

03:55.942 --> 03:57.643
It's me. I'm OK.

04:03.616 --> 04:05.751
Danny, is that you? Say something.

04:10.089 --> 04:12.190
Hey, Danny. Come on, man.
Say something.

04:12.225 --> 04:14.092
Danny, cut it out. Answer us.

04:14.127 --> 04:16.327
This is freaky. What is that?

04:18.264 --> 04:19.598
Aah!

04:19.632 --> 04:20.866
Danny, where are you?!

04:20.899 --> 04:22.768
Danny, answer us!

04:23.970 --> 04:26.405
Go, you guys! Go!
Get out of here! Run!

04:26.439 --> 04:28.240
Run, run!

04:28.274 --> 04:30.375
Greg, come on!

04:30.410 --> 04:33.612
Get out, get out,
something's behind us, hurry!

04:37.417 --> 04:38.617
Where's Danny?

04:38.651 --> 04:40.652
I...I don't know.
I thought he was right behind me.

04:40.687 --> 04:42.220
Oh, God.

04:42.255 --> 04:43.388
Look, I heard breathing.

04:43.423 --> 04:44.556
So did I.

04:45.458 --> 04:46.425
Danny!

04:46.459 --> 04:48.660
Danny!

04:48.695 --> 04:50.162
Danny! Why won't you answer?!

04:50.196 --> 04:51.930
Danny, where are you?!

04:51.964 --> 04:54.666
Hey, remember the ghost that
I was telling you about,

04:54.734 --> 04:56.668
The one who was
cooking in my kitchen?

04:56.703 --> 04:59.204
Well, after she left,
I couldn't stop smelling pot roast.

04:59.272 --> 05:00.672
Shut up. She was that real?

05:00.707 --> 05:03.975
Should have sent her over to my
place instead of into the light.

05:04.010 --> 05:05.344
I love a good ghost roast.

05:05.378 --> 05:07.379
Something's happening
with my visions.

05:07.413 --> 05:09.715
It's like they're merging
together with my reality,

05:09.749 --> 05:11.650
And I can't tell the two apart.

05:11.684 --> 05:14.019
And you're worried you're on the
banana train to cuckooville.

05:14.053 --> 05:16.355
God, when are they gonna revoke
your therapist's license?

05:16.389 --> 05:17.522
And what are you doing?

05:17.557 --> 05:19.591
I'm looking for a used scooter.

05:19.625 --> 05:20.859
These are all motorized.

05:20.893 --> 05:24.296
Listen, you're one of
the sanest people I know

05:24.330 --> 05:25.263
And the strongest,

05:25.298 --> 05:27.232
Maybe even getting stronger,
in fact.

05:27.266 --> 05:28.633
What do you mean?

05:28.668 --> 05:30.135
I don't know. Could be
that you're tuning in

05:30.169 --> 05:31.536
To Aiden's powers. He's an empath,

05:31.571 --> 05:33.672
And when he feels something
a ghost went through,

05:33.706 --> 05:35.907
It's entirely real for
him and then to you, too.

05:35.942 --> 05:38.510
Fortunately,
he doesn't remember it.

05:38.544 --> 05:41.680
Fortunately for ghosts, you do.

05:41.714 --> 05:43.582
Let me just get my wallet.

05:43.616 --> 05:45.384
I'll treat for coffee.

05:46.719 --> 05:49.054
This isn't mine.

05:49.088 --> 05:50.555
Hey!

05:50.590 --> 05:51.957
Whaah!

05:51.991 --> 05:54.593
Whew. Dr. James.

05:54.627 --> 05:55.660
I'm sorry.

05:55.695 --> 05:57.562
I guess...I guess I fell asleep.

05:57.597 --> 06:00.098
Look, I was up all night.
I'm Greg Roth.

06:00.133 --> 06:01.299
I saw you around midterms,
remember?

06:01.334 --> 06:02.634
What are you doing here?

06:02.668 --> 06:03.769
Your door was open.

06:03.803 --> 06:05.504
Look, I couldn't wait out there.

06:05.538 --> 06:07.572
I couldn't talk to
anyone about this.

06:07.607 --> 06:09.107
Ok, well, schedule a
time for later today.

06:09.142 --> 06:11.576
It could be too late then,
OK? A friend of mine is missing.

06:11.611 --> 06:12.944
Well, did you tell the police?

06:12.979 --> 06:14.045
What am I gonna say?

06:14.080 --> 06:15.881
My drunk buddy wandered
off last night?

06:15.915 --> 06:18.049
They'll say he's probably
just sleeping it off.

06:18.084 --> 06:19.951
And you think that
something else happened?

06:21.888 --> 06:23.288
We heard something.

06:23.322 --> 06:27.325
We felt something that
made my skin crawl.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.494
Ok, but we never saw it.

06:29.529 --> 06:30.996
We never saw anything.

06:31.030 --> 06:33.131
Ok, Greg, tell us what happened.

06:33.166 --> 06:36.635
Look, we were out in the woods,
you know, partying,

06:36.702 --> 06:38.637
And we found this barn.

06:42.642 --> 06:45.076
Three of us went in,
but only two of us came out.

06:45.111 --> 06:47.145
Oh.

06:47.180 --> 06:49.781
Greg, tell us everything you know.

06:49.816 --> 06:51.116
We're going to help
you find your friend.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.686
You sure there's not
some other place

07:30.687 --> 07:32.768
Danny might have gone?
Maybe a girlfriend's, or...?

07:32.769 --> 07:33.971
I told you, we called her.

07:34.005 --> 07:35.920
We called all of our friends.

07:35.930 --> 07:37.831
Ok, anywhere he
might have crashed.

07:37.866 --> 07:39.333
It was 2:00 in the morning.

07:39.367 --> 07:40.901
What about his parents?

07:40.935 --> 07:42.069
They're out of state.

07:42.103 --> 07:43.470
Well, if he's freaked
out as you are,

07:43.505 --> 07:44.605
Maybe he made the drive.

07:44.639 --> 07:47.441
There was one car.
And we left in it.

07:47.475 --> 07:49.343
It was right after we
went to the quarry.

07:49.377 --> 07:51.245
We thought maybe he'd gone
on ahead of us, you know.

07:51.279 --> 07:52.913
Maybe he was there waiting.

07:52.947 --> 07:54.481
And the barn,
did you go back to it?

07:54.516 --> 07:56.650
Not until this morning.

07:56.684 --> 07:57.584
We looked everywhere.

07:57.619 --> 07:59.820
I'm telling you guys, he's gone.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.221
I wanted to go back last night,

08:01.256 --> 08:02.890
But it was dark, and...

08:02.924 --> 08:04.324
You were scared.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.926
Maybe you were right to be.

08:05.960 --> 08:08.128
What does that mean?

08:08.163 --> 08:10.931
Hey, well...

08:10.965 --> 08:13.333
What does Dr. James mean about
this gift that you have?

08:13.368 --> 08:15.903
What are you so convinced

08:15.937 --> 08:18.439
That something terrible
happened to your friend?

08:18.473 --> 08:21.075
Because everything about
that place felt wrong.

08:21.109 --> 08:23.110
Ok, like some terrible
thing had happened,

08:23.178 --> 08:25.145
Or was going to.

08:25.180 --> 08:26.947
Something was there.

08:26.981 --> 08:29.149
Something that was
not quite human.

08:29.184 --> 08:32.052
The barn, can you take us to it?

08:33.587 --> 08:35.789
This is what convinced
you something so great

08:35.823 --> 08:37.323
Was in the barn.

08:37.357 --> 08:38.659
They're old, I know.

08:38.693 --> 08:41.128
But somebody put a lot of work
into looking for something.

08:41.162 --> 08:44.698
Well, maybe whoever is inside
will tell us what that is.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.066
What, the guy who got the heave ho

08:46.101 --> 08:48.035
And the no-frills burial?

08:48.069 --> 08:50.471
Something gave me that vision.

08:52.941 --> 08:55.542
What are we looking for,
giant ghost moles?

08:55.577 --> 08:57.177
Ghost what?!

08:57.212 --> 09:00.814
Uh, don't to listen to me,
I'm using humor to cope.

09:00.849 --> 09:02.749
Is that what we're talking about?

09:02.784 --> 09:05.319
Ghosts?

09:05.353 --> 09:07.888
Is that your specialty?

09:07.922 --> 09:10.390
Uh, yes.

09:10.425 --> 09:13.160
I can see ghosts.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.630
Well, uh, whose do you see?

09:16.664 --> 09:18.332
I don't know.

09:18.366 --> 09:20.534
Your friend Danny, maybe.

09:20.568 --> 09:22.603
Ok, but Danny was alive
when we came here.

09:22.637 --> 09:24.705
Ok, something else,
or someone else,

09:24.739 --> 09:26.273
Was already here.

09:26.307 --> 09:29.910
Shh. Greg, just... go wait in
the car while we look around.

09:58.940 --> 10:00.474
Aah!

10:00.508 --> 10:01.875
What happened? Let me go!

10:01.910 --> 10:04.144
Come on, oh, God, come on!

10:17.592 --> 10:20.027
This place is a maze.

10:20.061 --> 10:21.295
What's up? Did you
figure anything out?

10:21.329 --> 10:24.898
It's time to call the police.

10:28.303 --> 10:31.004
Well, there are no reported
deaths at the barn,

10:31.039 --> 10:34.141
And no owner to ask about it.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.576
Ok, why are we looking for
some other dead person

10:35.610 --> 10:37.144
When we have a missing
college student,

10:37.178 --> 10:38.712
And you saw someone
get hurt in that barn?

10:38.746 --> 10:40.380
Because the student
was still alive

10:40.415 --> 10:41.615
When they'd sensed something.

10:41.649 --> 10:43.050
Ok, so if the ghost
was already there,

10:43.084 --> 10:45.319
What did he do with the kid?

10:45.353 --> 10:46.420
Then who was holding the shovel

10:46.454 --> 10:48.655
Scooping big piles of
mud onto whoever died?

10:48.690 --> 10:50.290
Well, if anybody would
ever talk to us,

10:50.325 --> 10:52.259
Maybe we'd find out.

10:52.293 --> 10:53.794
You know what, if Detective
Blair was still here...

10:53.828 --> 10:55.596
We'd be trusted resources,

10:55.630 --> 10:57.598
Not some kind of cagey flakes

10:57.632 --> 10:59.099
Who can't say how
they get this most

10:59.167 --> 11:01.034
Incredible useful information.

11:01.069 --> 11:02.469
Easy, tiger.

11:02.503 --> 11:05.038
We don't know if we have
any useful information yet.

11:05.073 --> 11:07.474
Hi. I'm Detective Colson.

11:07.508 --> 11:08.976
Are you the people who reported

11:09.010 --> 11:10.777
A missing student
out near route 44?

11:10.812 --> 11:12.579
Yeah, just south
of Lawson's corner.

11:12.614 --> 11:14.448
I'm a Professor over
at Rockland university.

11:14.482 --> 11:15.582
I'm Eli James.

11:15.617 --> 11:16.950
This is Melinda Gordon.

11:16.985 --> 11:18.418
How can I help you?

11:18.453 --> 11:20.120
Well, here's the thing.

11:20.154 --> 11:21.955
We were talking to
Detective Simon.

11:21.990 --> 11:23.190
We were trying to, anyway.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.292
Yeah, I know, I heard,
he got pulled on another case.

11:25.326 --> 11:26.793
You were saying this student,

11:26.828 --> 11:29.396
Danny Seitz,

11:29.464 --> 11:32.833
Went missing after some kind
of a break-in in a barn?

11:32.867 --> 11:34.768
How do you know about it?
Do you own the property?

11:34.802 --> 11:36.870
Look, this is going
to sound crazy,

11:36.904 --> 11:38.171
But we have very good
reasons to believe

11:38.206 --> 11:39.940
That this kid was
not just missing,

11:39.974 --> 11:41.341
But maybe hurt.

11:41.376 --> 11:43.744
Go on. Look, the thing is,

11:43.778 --> 11:45.479
We know that college kids
like to stay out all night.

11:45.513 --> 11:47.247
They don't like to
report in to anyone.

11:47.282 --> 11:49.283
Right, but this one
vanished last night

11:49.317 --> 11:50.784
While his friends were
screaming for him,

11:50.818 --> 11:53.287
And I don't know,
I just have a feeling.

11:54.856 --> 11:56.590
You're actually listening to us.

11:56.624 --> 11:58.525
Why is that?

11:58.559 --> 12:01.828
Night before last,
there was a robbery on Stonebridge,

12:01.863 --> 12:03.497
About a half hour
from this property.

12:03.531 --> 12:06.033
And the suspect,
the armed suspect,

12:06.067 --> 12:07.734
Got away.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.971
Empty barn's a pretty
good place to hide out.

12:15.977 --> 12:17.844
You don't think when a cop
says an armed fugitive

12:17.879 --> 12:20.280
Might be some place,
that's a place to avoid?

12:20.315 --> 12:21.682
Look, if someone's here...

12:21.716 --> 12:24.117
And killed Danny and buried him
in some hole in the ground.

12:24.152 --> 12:26.119
He wouldn't stick around.

12:26.154 --> 12:28.055
You know this because of all your close,
personal relationships

12:28.089 --> 12:29.556
With armed fugitives?

12:29.590 --> 12:31.391
This area is clear.

12:31.426 --> 12:33.694
Let's take it around back.

12:48.776 --> 12:51.144
Hello?

12:54.749 --> 12:57.617
I know you're here.

12:58.953 --> 13:00.687
I can feel you.

13:03.291 --> 13:05.192
Danny?

13:05.226 --> 13:06.660
Or...

13:06.694 --> 13:09.763
Whoever you are, you don't
have to hide from me, OK?

13:11.099 --> 13:12.399
I want to help you.

13:33.121 --> 13:35.122
No!

13:37.024 --> 13:38.925
What happened?

13:38.960 --> 13:39.893
Are you OK? Fine.

13:39.927 --> 13:41.228
Then why'd you scream?

13:41.262 --> 13:43.430
You saw something.
It was probably nothing,

13:43.464 --> 13:45.932
Like a rat. Oh, yeah.

13:45.967 --> 13:48.769
She hates rats, fears them.
Many people do.

13:48.803 --> 13:51.138
Believe me. Did I
mention I'm a therapist?

13:51.172 --> 13:52.906
You know, I brought you here because
I thought you could be helpful.

13:52.940 --> 13:54.441
Because I thought
you wanted to be.

13:54.475 --> 13:56.443
We can! We do want to be.

13:56.477 --> 13:58.545
Well, then be straight with me.

13:58.579 --> 13:59.613
This feeling you had.

13:59.647 --> 14:01.415
More cases than you
know have been solved

14:01.449 --> 14:03.617
By a lot less...
a cop's intuition.

14:05.153 --> 14:07.454
Help me find this boy, because I
think something happened to him, too.

14:07.488 --> 14:09.456
And maybe it's not too late.

14:11.359 --> 14:14.027
I see ghosts.

14:14.061 --> 14:17.230
And I saw someone
being shot over here,

14:17.265 --> 14:20.267
And then their body was
thrown in a hole and buried.

14:20.301 --> 14:23.804
And you saw this missing kid?

14:23.838 --> 14:26.339
I've seen his face online.

14:26.374 --> 14:28.442
So I know what he looks like.

14:28.476 --> 14:30.677
But I haven't seen anyone's
face in my visions.

14:31.979 --> 14:34.247
I should show you something.

14:44.158 --> 14:46.626
Now, I don't know if somebody
cut themselves or worse,

14:46.661 --> 14:49.596
But there was blood.
Pretty fresh from the looks of it.

14:49.630 --> 14:53.233
Fresh as in last night?

14:53.267 --> 14:55.402
Is there more? Is there
anything you're not telling me?

14:55.436 --> 14:56.536
Detective Colson.

14:56.571 --> 14:58.338
Go for Colson.

14:58.372 --> 15:01.608
We need you outside immediately.
Found human remains.

15:04.045 --> 15:05.645
All right, I'll tell 'em.

15:05.680 --> 15:06.947
Sir, forensic unit is en route.

15:06.981 --> 15:08.815
Ok. Forensics are on their way,
but keep going.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.090
Who the hell is he?

15:17.124 --> 15:18.124
Well, whoever he is,

15:18.159 --> 15:20.660
He's been dead for
more than one night.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.113
Fresh blood and old bones?

15:29.200 --> 15:31.189
Sounds like a recipe
for total confusion.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.167
Not if what the kids
sensed was a ghost.

15:33.235 --> 15:35.003
Hmm. Mr. Bones.

15:35.037 --> 15:36.270
What about the fresh blood?

15:36.305 --> 15:37.472
Guess it was Danny's.

15:37.506 --> 15:39.073
And the buried body
and the gunshot?

15:39.108 --> 15:42.210
I didn't hear the kid say
anything about hearing a gunshot.

15:42.244 --> 15:43.578
Maybe the vision you had

15:43.612 --> 15:45.146
Was for something that
happened to Danny later.

15:45.180 --> 15:47.181
Maybe he wasn't shot at the
barn but someplace else later.

15:47.216 --> 15:48.349
Maybe. Hey. Hey.

15:48.384 --> 15:49.784
Any word on the skeleton?

15:49.818 --> 15:52.253
Yeah, the coroner sent the DNA
sample to missing persons bureau

15:52.287 --> 15:53.488
And they got a hit.

15:53.522 --> 15:55.990
These bones belong to a
kid named Henry Alston.

15:56.025 --> 15:57.425
Get this...he was
kidnapped a decade ago,

15:57.459 --> 15:58.993
And never found.

15:59.028 --> 16:00.028
Well, until now.

16:00.062 --> 16:01.863
I had no idea about this,

16:01.897 --> 16:03.064
But this is a big
deal to the cops.

16:03.098 --> 16:05.033
It was a huge unsolved mystery.

16:05.067 --> 16:06.401
Alston? As in the alstons,

16:06.435 --> 16:08.803
Who donated a building
to this university?

16:08.837 --> 16:10.838
Yeah, and gave a wing
to this hospital,

16:10.873 --> 16:13.274
And then gave $2 million

16:13.308 --> 16:14.242
To the kidnappers.

16:14.276 --> 16:15.676
Their son was never found.

16:15.711 --> 16:16.978
The money was never traced.

16:17.012 --> 16:18.479
Kidnappers disappeared.

16:18.514 --> 16:20.948
I've been watching
this video online.

16:20.983 --> 16:23.284
It's his parents on a
local television station

16:23.318 --> 16:26.054
Begging the kidnappers
for their son's live.

16:26.088 --> 16:28.056
He was 18 years old.

16:28.090 --> 16:29.190
Think he's our ghost?

16:29.224 --> 16:30.425
I don't know.

16:30.459 --> 16:31.826
I haven't seen him yet.

16:31.860 --> 16:34.529
Excuse me. Detective Colson?

16:34.563 --> 16:36.798
Yeah. I can come by.

16:38.167 --> 16:41.169
Thank you for bringing Henry home.

16:41.203 --> 16:44.072
That's the last form.

16:44.106 --> 16:46.140
Ms. Alston?

16:46.175 --> 16:47.375
Yes?

16:47.409 --> 16:48.476
Hi.

16:48.510 --> 16:50.178
My name is Melinda Gordon.

16:50.212 --> 16:53.147
I was there when
they found your son.

16:53.182 --> 16:55.416
I'm so sorry for your loss.

16:55.451 --> 16:57.018
Thank you.

16:57.052 --> 16:59.554
It's so strange.

16:59.588 --> 17:02.790
I've known for years
that Henry must be dead.

17:02.825 --> 17:04.791
But there was always

17:04.827 --> 17:08.463
Just a little part
of me that...hoped.

17:08.497 --> 17:09.997
You're his mother.

17:10.031 --> 17:11.566
Of course you hoped.

17:11.599 --> 17:14.702
They give that to you...

17:14.736 --> 17:16.137
The kidnappers.

17:16.171 --> 17:19.674
That's what ransom is, hope.

17:19.708 --> 17:22.577
You think you can
buy it with money.

17:22.611 --> 17:26.547
The almighty Alston fortune.

17:26.582 --> 17:29.450
Look what it bought us.

17:29.485 --> 17:32.086
I knew what I was marrying into.

17:32.121 --> 17:33.254
It's just...

17:33.288 --> 17:34.956
You were worried.

17:34.990 --> 17:37.892
Long before the kidnapping.

17:37.926 --> 17:41.262
So many of Henry's cousins
fell into the same trap.

17:41.296 --> 17:43.097
They didn't know how
to work for anything,

17:43.132 --> 17:45.066
They never had the chance.

17:45.100 --> 17:48.202
We didn't want that for our son.

17:48.237 --> 17:51.272
We...were so careful.

17:51.306 --> 17:53.007
How?

17:53.041 --> 17:57.345
Oh, Henry always knew he'd have
to make his own way in this world.

17:57.379 --> 18:00.481
Oh, give him a good home
and the best education,

18:00.516 --> 18:03.684
And all the tools
he'd need to succeed,

18:03.719 --> 18:05.219
But not the money.

18:05.254 --> 18:08.156
Well, I'm sure it made
him a stronger person.

18:08.190 --> 18:10.691
It did. Even at boarding school.

18:10.726 --> 18:14.495
Henry could see past all
the fancy last names.

18:14.530 --> 18:17.198
His best friend were
the scholarship kids.

18:17.232 --> 18:20.835
You know, parents are cops,

18:20.869 --> 18:22.603
Teachers.

18:22.638 --> 18:25.973
He would have been
a really good man.

18:27.176 --> 18:30.578
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

18:34.850 --> 18:37.285
I called because I hit a wall.

18:37.319 --> 18:41.055
The robbery suspect I told you about;
The one on the run,

18:41.089 --> 18:43.291
He was caught. He stole a car here

18:43.325 --> 18:44.859
And made it all the
way to Florida.

18:44.893 --> 18:46.894
So he was gone long
before Danny went missing.

18:46.929 --> 18:50.231
But I'm left with a bunch of
puzzle pieces that don't fit.

18:50.265 --> 18:52.700
I've got one missing student,

18:52.734 --> 18:53.968
A trail of blood,
that as it turns out,

18:54.002 --> 18:56.003
Matches his type and reason
to believe, thanks to you,

18:56.038 --> 18:59.941
That either the student
or Henry Alston was shot.

18:59.975 --> 19:01.976
I wish I knew more.

19:03.645 --> 19:05.079
Look...

19:05.113 --> 19:08.916
I don't know how
you do what you do.

19:08.951 --> 19:11.852
We found this at the
scene down in a hole

19:11.887 --> 19:13.854
With fresh blood on it.

19:13.889 --> 19:15.957
May I?

19:28.570 --> 19:29.770
I saw someone.

19:29.805 --> 19:32.206
In the barn. A man.
The student, Danny?

19:32.241 --> 19:34.508
I don't know, it was a man,
and he was taking these bags

19:34.543 --> 19:36.043
Out of this dirty space.

19:36.078 --> 19:38.479
What kind of space?
I couldn't tell.

19:38.513 --> 19:39.814
What did the bags look like?

19:39.848 --> 19:41.082
Did you see anything identifiable?

19:41.116 --> 19:42.383
They were rectangular,

19:42.417 --> 19:44.385
Blue canvas, about this big.

19:44.419 --> 19:47.922
Banks use bags like that
to transport deposits.

19:47.956 --> 19:50.057
So maybe it was the
ransom money, then?

19:50.092 --> 19:53.127
In that barn?
After all these years?

19:54.463 --> 19:56.797
Did you see anyone?

19:56.832 --> 19:58.833
For all I know, I could have been

19:58.867 --> 20:00.534
Looking right at the kidnappers.

20:00.569 --> 20:02.937
Or that kid from the other night.

20:02.971 --> 20:04.238
Danny.

20:04.273 --> 20:05.740
Maybe that's why he's missing.

20:10.345 --> 20:11.946
Hey. Are you still up for yoga?

20:11.980 --> 20:13.481
Sure. Just let me get my stuff.

20:13.515 --> 20:15.716
Any word on that
missing college kid?

20:15.751 --> 20:16.884
No, nothing.

20:16.918 --> 20:18.919
Any sighting on the ghost, Henry?

20:18.954 --> 20:20.621
No, which makes me wonder

20:20.656 --> 20:22.523
If he is the ghost.

20:22.557 --> 20:24.425
Well, why? He was buried there.

20:24.459 --> 20:25.993
Because if you're
just hanging around,

20:26.028 --> 20:27.528
I mean, wouldn't you at
least try to find me?

20:27.562 --> 20:28.963
I don't know,
maybe get some justice.

20:28.997 --> 20:30.698
Ooh. Eli, what's up?

20:30.732 --> 20:31.699
Danny is still alive.

20:31.733 --> 20:33.534
Oh, that's great, I'm so relieved.

20:33.568 --> 20:35.569
They arrested him at
the Canadian border

20:35.604 --> 20:37.905
With $80,000 cash in his trunk.

20:37.939 --> 20:40.308
Phew. That's gotta be part
of the ransom money, right?

20:40.342 --> 20:41.942
I'm gonna go talk to Colson.

20:41.977 --> 20:43.244
See if I can find
out anything more.

20:43.278 --> 20:44.412
I'll talk to you later.

20:44.446 --> 20:45.579
Ok, thanks, bye.

20:45.614 --> 20:47.682
So he's under arrest,
but he's safe?

20:47.716 --> 20:48.949
Well, not necessarily.

20:48.984 --> 20:50.384
I mean, what if all the hauntings

20:50.419 --> 20:52.186
At the barn just
have to do with cash?

20:52.220 --> 20:55.122
Yeah, but why does a
ghost care about money?

20:55.157 --> 20:57.291
Well, if the ghost
is Henry Alston,

20:57.326 --> 20:59.393
How would you feel if
a bunch of drunk kids

20:59.428 --> 21:01.796
Were stealing money
that you had to die for?

21:01.830 --> 21:03.764
Yeah, but didn't the
parents pay $2 million?

21:03.799 --> 21:05.900
Where's the rest of it?

21:13.275 --> 21:15.242
Hello?

21:19.047 --> 21:21.082
Is anybody here?

21:56.218 --> 21:57.918
It's OK.

21:57.953 --> 22:01.122
It's OK, just keep looking.

22:34.300 --> 22:36.623
They brought him in right
after the shift change.

22:36.630 --> 22:38.597
He fell through a rotted
floorboard in the barn,

22:38.632 --> 22:40.800
And he was unconscious there
most of the night.

22:40.834 --> 22:41.967
Is he OK?

22:42.002 --> 22:43.135
Yeah. He had a concussion.

22:43.170 --> 22:44.870
He got some stitches,
but otherwise he's fine.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.572
It's a good thing he
had his cell phone.

22:46.606 --> 22:48.007
He came to and called 9-1-1.

22:48.041 --> 22:49.542
Has Detective Colson been here?

22:49.576 --> 22:51.911
Yeah. He was here,
and with a uniform.

22:51.945 --> 22:53.479
And I thought you'd want
to talk to this kid,

22:53.513 --> 22:55.748
Especially after I
saw who was visiting.

22:57.651 --> 22:58.851
I thought Danny was in jail.

22:58.885 --> 23:00.586
Out on bail.

23:03.824 --> 23:05.858
I spoke to your friend Greg.

23:05.892 --> 23:09.128
He told me that he felt
something in that barn.

23:09.162 --> 23:13.399
Something that wanted to scare
you or hurt you or both.

23:13.433 --> 23:14.767
He said that you felt it, too.

23:14.801 --> 23:15.935
Yeah, I did.

23:15.969 --> 23:17.403
From the moment we went in.

23:17.437 --> 23:19.171
So then why did you go back?

23:19.206 --> 23:21.640
For the money.

23:21.675 --> 23:22.808
He went back for the money.

23:22.843 --> 23:25.044
Scott, it's time to come clean.

23:25.078 --> 23:27.980
'cause when the police
brought me back here,

23:28.014 --> 23:29.748
I realized that there
had to be more.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.517
Kidnappers must have split it up

23:31.551 --> 23:33.052
To come back for it later.

23:33.086 --> 23:34.353
Well, they didn't get it.

23:34.387 --> 23:36.188
Not all of it.

23:36.223 --> 23:38.958
That's why there were all those
holes in the ground, right?

23:38.992 --> 23:42.494
So you sent Scott
back to look for more.

23:42.562 --> 23:44.563
When I went back,

23:44.598 --> 23:46.866
It was like something
was leading me.

23:46.900 --> 23:49.301
I figured to the money.

23:49.336 --> 23:50.436
But...

23:50.470 --> 23:52.638
The floor was totally rotten,

23:52.672 --> 23:55.274
And I guess it was just a trap.

23:55.308 --> 23:58.944
Or punishment.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.313
Whatever was in that barn
didn't want us there.

24:01.348 --> 24:03.048
I saw something moving.

24:03.083 --> 24:05.284
I had this feeling
like something was

24:05.318 --> 24:07.152
Crawling up the back of my neck.

24:07.187 --> 24:08.921
I screamed.

24:08.955 --> 24:10.723
My leg went through the floor.

24:12.259 --> 24:13.759
It was stuck.

24:13.793 --> 24:15.794
And that's when I noticed there
was something hidden down there.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.463
Money.

24:17.497 --> 24:20.466
Lots of it.

24:23.336 --> 24:26.338
And you were willing to bail
on your friends and your life?

24:26.373 --> 24:29.708
My folks can't get a job.

24:29.743 --> 24:31.844
The bank foreclosed
on their house.

24:31.878 --> 24:33.479
I can't pay for next
semester anyway.

24:33.513 --> 24:35.514
I figured I'd go to Canada,

24:35.548 --> 24:39.184
Call my parents and
start over again.

24:39.219 --> 24:41.053
It sounds stupid,
but when you have that much cash

24:41.087 --> 24:42.254
In your hands like that,

24:42.289 --> 24:43.622
It's hard to think straight.

24:43.657 --> 24:48.894
I don't think you're the first
person to feel that way.

24:50.263 --> 24:52.231
Or the last.

25:00.073 --> 25:03.008
Look, whoever you are,

25:03.043 --> 25:05.878
Whatever you did, it's over now.

25:05.912 --> 25:09.181
But I think I can
help find you peace.

25:09.215 --> 25:11.517
You know, you can't punish people,

25:11.551 --> 25:13.953
Not kids, for wanting money.

25:13.987 --> 25:15.287
I don't need to.

25:15.322 --> 25:17.456
Money destroys everything.

25:17.490 --> 25:20.025
But it's gone now,
and no one will ever find it.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.094
Henry, what happened to you?

25:22.128 --> 25:23.862
How long have I been here?

25:25.131 --> 25:26.532
11 years.

25:27.734 --> 25:30.736
Do you remember who did this?

25:30.770 --> 25:33.706
I have no idea.
I never saw their faces.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.441
I went out for a ride
just to get some air.

25:35.475 --> 25:36.809
I didn't even hear him pull up.

25:36.843 --> 25:37.943
Hey, you need some
help there, pal?

25:37.978 --> 25:40.612
He asked if I needed some help.

25:40.647 --> 25:43.148
Get in the van!

25:45.385 --> 25:47.419
Everything you read says to run.

25:47.454 --> 25:49.221
Never get into a stranger's car.

25:49.255 --> 25:51.156
I knew that.

25:51.191 --> 25:52.992
But when you're
looking at a gun...

25:59.466 --> 26:02.101
Did you see who was holding it?

26:02.135 --> 26:04.503
I never saw their faces. Ok.

26:04.537 --> 26:06.772
But what about after you died?

26:06.806 --> 26:10.175
I was in a dark space so long,
I wasn't even sure

26:10.210 --> 26:11.543
What had happened.

26:11.578 --> 26:14.079
By the time I realized,
everyone was gone.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.715
I've been alone here ever since.

26:16.750 --> 26:18.717
I saw you digging.

26:18.752 --> 26:20.819
Did they let you out?

26:20.854 --> 26:22.588
I was digging my own grave.

26:22.622 --> 26:25.224
Why did you stay here?

26:25.258 --> 26:27.059
Weren't you drawn to your family?

26:27.093 --> 26:29.128
I knew they'd be in so much pain.

26:29.162 --> 26:31.964
But I can help you talk to them.

26:31.998 --> 26:33.399
Wouldn't that hurt them more;

26:33.433 --> 26:35.434
Stirring it all up again?

26:35.468 --> 26:37.936
They've been through enough.
Leave them be.

26:37.971 --> 26:40.606
Look, it's just your mom now.

26:40.640 --> 26:45.077
But I think that I can
bring both of you peace.

26:45.111 --> 26:47.713
I can't feel anything.

26:49.015 --> 26:51.383
That's peace enough.

26:58.191 --> 27:00.492
Hey. Look, yeah,
I got your message.

27:00.527 --> 27:02.795
The police do have all of Henry
Alston's personal effects.

27:02.829 --> 27:04.730
His bones are still here? Yeah...

27:04.764 --> 27:05.831
I need to see them.

27:05.865 --> 27:07.166
Ok. What's going on?

27:07.200 --> 27:08.367
I just talked to him.

27:08.401 --> 27:09.668
So he is your ghost?

27:09.702 --> 27:11.236
Yeah. He told me
what happened to him.

27:11.271 --> 27:12.571
At first, he was numb and lost

27:12.605 --> 27:14.006
And I felt bad for him. Right.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.374
And then he told me
that his kidnappers

27:15.408 --> 27:16.642
Made him dig his own grave.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.043
That's funny.
That's just about the time

27:18.078 --> 27:19.178
I would have started
to feel worse for him.

27:19.212 --> 27:20.546
Yeah, it's just in my vision,

27:20.580 --> 27:22.448
He was being thrown into a ditch.

27:22.482 --> 27:24.383
Ok, the one in which they
actually found his bones?

27:24.417 --> 27:25.851
Yeah, the soil was wet and muddy.

27:25.885 --> 27:27.052
But when he was digging,
it was dry.

27:27.087 --> 27:28.587
Well, maybe they killed him
before he was finished,

27:28.621 --> 27:30.255
Or maybe it was raining, right?

27:30.290 --> 27:31.890
Or maybe he was digging
something else,

27:31.925 --> 27:33.959
Or someone else.

27:35.929 --> 27:37.262
What are you looking for?

27:37.297 --> 27:39.264
Well, since I don't
have anything of his,

27:39.299 --> 27:40.866
I figured I'd go
straight to the source.

27:49.843 --> 27:50.909
Slow down.

27:50.944 --> 27:52.611
Last thing you need to do

27:52.645 --> 27:54.446
Is get pulled over right now.

27:56.749 --> 27:58.984
What is it?

27:59.018 --> 28:01.753
The last thing the
ghost wanted me to see.

28:01.788 --> 28:05.557
Henry was in on it.

28:05.592 --> 28:07.726
He staged his own kidnapping.

28:15.300 --> 28:16.534
Thanks for meeting me.

28:16.568 --> 28:18.002
I ordered you a black coffee.

28:18.036 --> 28:19.971
Thanks. Look, I get it.

28:20.005 --> 28:22.006
Ghosts probably aren't your
favorite topic in a police station.

28:22.040 --> 28:25.143
You said you saw something,
a vision?

28:25.177 --> 28:27.678
I couldn't stop thinking
about what Henry's mom said,

28:27.713 --> 28:29.847
About cutting him off
from the family money

28:29.882 --> 28:32.750
For his own good. And I had
a vision of the kidnapping,

28:32.818 --> 28:35.353
And there was this moment afterwards
where Henry was alone in the van

28:35.387 --> 28:37.622
With his captors,
and he wasn't exactly afraid.

28:37.656 --> 28:40.792
You think Henry was in
on his own kidnapping.

28:40.826 --> 28:43.194
You don't seem surprised.

28:43.228 --> 28:45.663
I've been circling that
same theory myself.

28:45.697 --> 28:47.598
The only problem is,
from what I read,

28:47.633 --> 28:50.168
All of Henry's friends checked out.
And if Henry was in on it,

28:50.202 --> 28:51.469
Then why did he end up dead,

28:51.503 --> 28:53.237
And what happened to
his share of the money?

28:53.272 --> 28:55.606
I had 2 separate visions
of the holes being dug.

28:55.641 --> 28:58.009
The first was Henry's
body outside the barn.

28:58.043 --> 28:59.677
The ground was wet,
like it had been raining,

28:59.711 --> 29:02.647
And the other was the hole he
was digging, and it was dry.

29:02.681 --> 29:04.549
So it was dry.
What does that mean?

29:04.583 --> 29:06.050
Maybe it was inside the barn.

29:06.084 --> 29:07.652
And you think the second hole

29:07.686 --> 29:09.520
Was to bury the ransom money, why?

29:09.555 --> 29:12.056
Because he said that money
destroys everything,

29:12.090 --> 29:14.792
So what if it destroyed
his partnerships?

29:15.727 --> 29:17.361
With his co-conspirators.

29:17.396 --> 29:20.031
Maybe once he and his buddies
got their hands on the cash,

29:20.065 --> 29:21.999
Somebody double crossed him,
or he double crossed them.

29:22.034 --> 29:24.335
Because he wanted all
the money for himself.

29:24.369 --> 29:25.670
Or because he knew
that somebody else did,

29:25.704 --> 29:27.138
And he hid it to protect himself.

29:27.172 --> 29:29.507
Look, it would explain why Danny
only got some of the money.

29:29.541 --> 29:32.009
And the other holes
outside the barn.

29:32.044 --> 29:33.878
Thanks. Yeah.

29:33.912 --> 29:37.048
His buddies must think that's
where he hid the ransom money.

29:37.082 --> 29:38.883
You really should consider
a job on the force.

29:38.917 --> 29:42.386
Oh, I just want to help
this spirit find some peace.

29:42.421 --> 29:43.754
So what do you do now?

29:43.789 --> 29:46.090
Talk to his mother. You know,
she deserves to know the truth

29:46.124 --> 29:47.625
And decide if she
wants to forgive him.

29:47.659 --> 29:50.294
And the ghost goes
to a better place.

29:50.329 --> 29:53.130
Well, before he does,
you can make my job a lot easier

29:53.165 --> 29:54.999
If you got him to tell
me who killed him.

29:55.033 --> 29:56.734
Any chance of that?

29:56.768 --> 29:59.937
Trust me, you will
be the first to know.

30:03.375 --> 30:04.909
Just make sure he keeps up
with his meds, it's all good.

30:04.943 --> 30:06.711
Hey. Hey. Thanks.

30:06.745 --> 30:08.946
Mrs. Alston come here? She was
supposed to sign for her son's remains.

30:08.981 --> 30:10.214
You just missed her.

30:10.249 --> 30:11.349
How'd it go with Colson?

30:11.383 --> 30:12.984
You have any idea about
Henry's accomplices?

30:13.018 --> 30:14.819
All of Henry's friends were investigated.
They found nothing.

30:14.853 --> 30:17.722
Eli's going to check the
yearbook and school records.

30:17.756 --> 30:20.091
Ok. Oh, you're leaving
already? Where to?

30:20.125 --> 30:21.759
I need Henry to talk to his mom.

30:21.793 --> 30:23.261
All right. Be careful.

30:23.295 --> 30:24.829
Where have I heard that before?

30:24.863 --> 30:27.598
Bye.

30:30.302 --> 30:32.770
Henry?

30:32.804 --> 30:34.472
We need to talk.

30:34.506 --> 30:37.174
Your mom, she needs
to hear from you.

30:37.209 --> 30:39.176
Look, I know that you stayed quiet

30:39.211 --> 30:41.012
To protect your parents,

30:41.046 --> 30:43.514
But it's too late now.

30:43.548 --> 30:45.516
The police know what happened,

30:45.550 --> 30:47.952
And it's only a matter of
time before it all comes out.

30:47.986 --> 30:50.988
You know, I could
talk to your mom.

30:51.023 --> 30:53.457
Tell her what happened.

30:53.492 --> 30:55.626
What you did and why,

30:55.661 --> 30:56.894
And then once she forgives you...

30:56.929 --> 30:59.530
You don't know anything.

30:59.564 --> 31:01.565
You're not helping me or anyone.

31:01.600 --> 31:04.535
Leave.

31:04.569 --> 31:06.704
Before it's too late.

31:06.738 --> 31:09.206
You can't scare me away.

31:09.241 --> 31:11.676
Not like you did those kids.

31:15.380 --> 31:17.415
I'm begging you.

31:17.449 --> 31:18.950
Leave this alone.

31:18.984 --> 31:20.818
You're in danger.

31:24.089 --> 31:25.823
What are you doing here?

31:25.857 --> 31:27.725
Oh. I had to talk to the ghost.

31:27.759 --> 31:29.760
Those kidnappers,
they could be anywhere.

31:29.795 --> 31:31.128
This thing's in the papers now.

31:31.163 --> 31:32.763
Yeah, I know. Take a look.

31:32.798 --> 31:35.266
Someone's been here,
those holes are new.

31:36.535 --> 31:38.369
For your safety,
I think you better leave.

31:38.403 --> 31:39.870
I think I agree.

31:41.573 --> 31:42.740
Hey, what's up?

31:42.774 --> 31:44.375
Remember Henry's mom said

31:44.409 --> 31:45.576
He became friends with
the scholarship kids

31:45.610 --> 31:46.844
Whose parents were
teachers and cops?

31:46.878 --> 31:48.312
Yeah, I remember.

31:48.347 --> 31:51.449
Well, one of those kids
grew up to be an actual cop.

31:51.483 --> 31:53.184
You'll never guess who it is.

31:57.055 --> 31:58.723
Just walk to your car.

31:58.757 --> 32:00.791
Don't show him you know who he is.

32:02.060 --> 32:04.028
Ok, I won't.

32:04.062 --> 32:05.162
What's that tone?

32:05.197 --> 32:06.931
What's going on?
Is he there with you?

32:06.999 --> 32:09.266
Yep, sure thing.

32:09.301 --> 32:11.936
Are...are you at the barn?

32:11.970 --> 32:13.004
Should I call for help?

32:13.038 --> 32:16.273
Of course, and I'll
talk to you later.

32:16.308 --> 32:17.842
Who was that?

32:18.810 --> 32:22.346
Oh, it was my husband.

32:22.381 --> 32:23.914
He wants to make
me dinner tonight,

32:23.949 --> 32:26.550
And I have to stop
by the store, so...

32:28.900 --> 32:30.667
Stop.

32:30.702 --> 32:33.170
Turn around.

32:35.940 --> 32:38.208
I'm sorry.

32:38.242 --> 32:41.211
But this is as far as you go.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.126
Look, you don't
want to do this, OK?

32:49.200 --> 32:50.667
That was my friend on the phone.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.870
He knows where we are
and what you did.

32:52.904 --> 32:55.205
He knows that you met in school,

32:55.273 --> 32:56.673
And that you were
Henry's accomplice, OK?

32:56.708 --> 32:57.941
Please don't make this any worse.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.209
The police are going
to be here soon.

32:59.244 --> 33:01.945
You think I wanted my
life to end up this way?

33:01.980 --> 33:05.482
I never saw a dime of that money.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.417
You know what I did for it?

33:07.452 --> 33:09.453
Please, you don't have to do this.

33:09.487 --> 33:12.156
I do now. I have to go away.

33:14.292 --> 33:17.194
You dug these holes right after I
told you there was money in here.

33:18.263 --> 33:20.564
Only problem is,
I didn't know where to dig.

33:20.598 --> 33:22.766
Neither do I.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.902
No, but Henry does.

33:24.936 --> 33:27.971
Why would he tell you?
You murdered him.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.307
He won't let the same
thing happen to you.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.342
He's way too soft.

33:35.814 --> 33:37.314
Is that why you fought?

33:37.348 --> 33:38.882
Because he wouldn't
go through with it?

33:38.917 --> 33:41.185
Just take this shovel,
and you tell me if he's here.

33:41.219 --> 33:43.587
Now!

33:43.621 --> 33:44.922
I don't see him.

33:44.956 --> 33:46.723
No?

33:51.596 --> 33:53.764
Well, I'll be he sees me.

33:53.798 --> 33:55.032
Tell him I'll do it.

33:55.066 --> 33:57.067
Henry...

33:59.003 --> 34:00.204
Just trust me.

34:02.307 --> 34:03.841
I thought so.

34:05.743 --> 34:06.910
Where is it?

34:06.945 --> 34:08.145
Tell him it's not really buried,

34:08.179 --> 34:09.346
It's inside that wall.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.614
He said he was lying.

34:11.649 --> 34:13.083
He never buried it.

34:13.117 --> 34:15.719
It's inside that wall.

34:18.322 --> 34:19.723
Give me that shovel.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.324
You get over there.

34:21.359 --> 34:22.926
Move back.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.069
I see it!

34:32.103 --> 34:33.469
Ha!

34:35.907 --> 34:37.440
That son of a...

34:37.475 --> 34:40.344
He said it was buried,
why'd I believe him?

34:40.378 --> 34:42.346
Because you knew he
was better than you.

34:47.918 --> 34:50.387
Look, I'm sorry.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.755
I really am.

34:52.790 --> 34:53.757
But I have no choice.

34:53.791 --> 34:56.193
There's always a choice, Jeff.

34:58.196 --> 35:00.330
No!

35:10.708 --> 35:11.942
The reason they missed it

35:11.976 --> 35:14.111
Was because Colson was kicked
out of boarding school.

35:14.145 --> 35:15.379
He wasn't in the yearbook,

35:15.413 --> 35:17.514
And he wasn't in most of
the high school files.

35:17.548 --> 35:19.650
But I found him on
somebody's face page.

35:19.684 --> 35:22.019
So let me guess...
he got kicked out for stealing.

35:22.053 --> 35:23.487
Nice deduction, Detective.

35:23.521 --> 35:27.691
So he joined the force
just to stay on the case

35:27.725 --> 35:28.892
Of his own missing money?

35:28.927 --> 35:30.861
No, he needed a job and
his dad helped him get it.

35:30.895 --> 35:33.697
So did the ghost tell you why

35:33.731 --> 35:35.666
He decided to fake
his own kidnapping?

35:35.700 --> 35:37.301
Not yet.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.208
I don't understand.

35:45.243 --> 35:47.010
I just...

35:47.045 --> 35:48.645
I don't understand.

35:50.548 --> 35:53.250
Henry.

35:54.419 --> 35:56.753
Tell her it was nothing she did.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.588
Tell her I was an idiot.

35:58.623 --> 36:00.424
I think she needs more than that.

36:00.458 --> 36:03.160
Go ahead.

36:05.396 --> 36:07.397
At first it didn't bother me,

36:07.432 --> 36:09.299
The money thing.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.435
The trust fund brats,
they drove their beamers,

36:11.469 --> 36:13.036
They did their club
scene downtown,

36:13.071 --> 36:14.404
I didn't care.

36:14.439 --> 36:17.140
I studied. I worked out.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.309
I did my own thing.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.345
Then I met Jeff.

36:21.379 --> 36:23.113
What's up, man?

36:23.147 --> 36:25.449
He was funny, and quick.

36:25.483 --> 36:27.184
But he had a chip on his shoulder.

36:27.218 --> 36:29.753
He really wanted to be
one of those rich kids.

36:29.787 --> 36:31.655
When he found out
I had money, too,

36:31.689 --> 36:34.224
He couldn't believe I
didn't live like it.

36:34.258 --> 36:36.360
I told him my parents
didn't believe in that.

36:36.394 --> 36:38.495
That seemed to tick him off.

36:38.529 --> 36:40.464
He kept saying that rich
people only got rich

36:40.498 --> 36:42.733
By taking what they wanted.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.468
And if I wanted the
freedom that I deserved,

36:44.502 --> 36:46.970
I should reach out and
take what was already mine.

36:47.005 --> 36:48.972
At first I just laughed him off.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.874
But I started to listen
when he talked about

36:50.908 --> 36:52.909
How mom and dad didn't trust me.

36:52.944 --> 36:55.679
Did they think I was so weak,

36:55.713 --> 36:58.015
The money would take
away all of my morals?

36:58.049 --> 36:59.983
He made friends with Jeff,

37:00.018 --> 37:03.286
And Jeff questioned why you
guys kept money from him.

37:04.655 --> 37:06.823
He thought you didn't trust him.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.225
No.

37:08.259 --> 37:10.794
We just wanted Henry to
know what it felt like

37:10.828 --> 37:13.030
To earn his own success.

37:14.198 --> 37:16.566
Henry's father knew
better than anyone;

37:16.601 --> 37:18.001
When money's handed to you,

37:18.036 --> 37:19.936
It can take away
all your ambition,

37:19.971 --> 37:23.240
And your self worth.

37:23.274 --> 37:25.609
Well, either way, they were right.

37:25.643 --> 37:28.779
My money was stronger than I was.

37:28.813 --> 37:31.748
I let Jeff talk me
into the kidnapping.

37:31.783 --> 37:35.185
Get in the van!

37:40.058 --> 37:41.691
We did it, man! We did it!

37:45.797 --> 37:47.197
Henry...

37:47.231 --> 37:48.865
She knows that you
were a part of it.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.234
She just doesn't understand
what happened next.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.371
After mom and dad paid the ransom,

37:54.405 --> 37:57.641
We holed up in that
farmhouse out near the barn.

37:57.675 --> 38:00.911
The plan was to wait until the
cops stopped watching the airports.

38:00.945 --> 38:02.913
Then we'd leave the country,

38:02.947 --> 38:04.581
Live off the money.

38:04.615 --> 38:06.716
But while we were waiting,

38:06.751 --> 38:08.085
We watched TV.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.619
We don't care about
punishing anyone.

38:09.654 --> 38:11.088
And there were my parents.

38:11.122 --> 38:14.891
We paid his ransom,
just release our son!

38:14.926 --> 38:18.195
Every day, they'd be
begging for my release.

38:18.229 --> 38:20.630
I just wanted them to
know that I was OK.

38:20.665 --> 38:23.233
I wanted to go home.

38:23.267 --> 38:25.435
I didn't care if
he kept the money.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.538
I'd tell the cops I got away.

38:28.573 --> 38:31.108
I swore I'd never tell
anyone what really happened.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.342
But Jeff wouldn't trust me.

38:32.376 --> 38:34.344
You can't go home.

38:34.378 --> 38:36.580
You don't think the cops
are going to question you?

38:36.614 --> 38:38.248
I won't tell them anything.

38:38.282 --> 38:39.249
Why would I?

38:39.283 --> 38:41.118
All I care is that my
parents never know.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.120
The police are going
to break you in half!

38:43.154 --> 38:44.521
I know, my dad's a cop!

38:44.555 --> 38:47.357
They can smell lies a mile off.

38:47.391 --> 38:48.658
It won't work!

38:48.693 --> 38:50.460
I'm not doing this to my parents.

38:50.495 --> 38:51.595
Not anymore.

38:51.629 --> 38:54.364
Don't you walk out that door, man.

38:54.398 --> 38:55.866
You're not going to shoot me.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.667
You can't.

38:57.702 --> 38:58.902
Yes, I can.

38:58.936 --> 39:00.871
Then you'll never see
that money again.

39:00.905 --> 39:02.339
What does that mean?
Where did you put it?

39:02.373 --> 39:05.542
It's hidden.
I buried it everywhere.

39:05.576 --> 39:08.478
And if I die,
you'll never find any of it.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.046
I'm leaving, Jeff.

39:10.081 --> 39:12.415
I'll call you as soon as
I get home, I promise.

39:12.450 --> 39:14.084
You'll get all the money.

39:14.118 --> 39:15.218
Henry!

39:15.253 --> 39:18.355
Don't, Henry!

39:18.389 --> 39:19.689
I swear!

39:43.147 --> 39:45.882
If he wanted money that badly...

39:45.917 --> 39:49.252
I wish he'd just asked us.

39:50.955 --> 39:53.723
I knew this was a bad idea.

39:56.961 --> 39:59.262
He wished that you'd never
found out the truth.

39:59.297 --> 40:01.031
No.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.667
No, that's wrong, Henry.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.669
Look at what I did to her.

40:07.438 --> 40:09.573
God, I wish I'd never lived.

40:10.741 --> 40:12.509
He can't forgive himself.

40:12.543 --> 40:15.779
Henry.

40:16.814 --> 40:18.415
Do you know when
your father proposed,

40:18.449 --> 40:20.650
I almost said no.

40:20.685 --> 40:23.687
I saw his cousins all
over the tabloids,

40:23.721 --> 40:27.290
And I thought, I don't want my
children to grow up like that.

40:27.325 --> 40:31.695
But you didn't, Henry.

40:31.729 --> 40:34.097
I know what kind of man you are.

40:34.131 --> 40:37.367
And even now, even...

40:37.401 --> 40:40.337
After everything I've lost,

40:40.371 --> 40:43.673
It was so worth it.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.811
I don't deserve this.

40:49.080 --> 40:52.282
He feels like he doesn't
deserve your forgiveness.

40:52.316 --> 40:54.718
Why?

40:54.752 --> 40:58.388
Why, you gave your life
to heal my broken heart.

40:59.890 --> 41:03.860
I would give mine to heal yours.

41:06.430 --> 41:08.999
Henry...

41:09.033 --> 41:10.567
If you want to make it right,

41:10.601 --> 41:12.969
You have to accept
her forgiveness.

41:23.247 --> 41:25.682
You can see it now, can't you?

41:28.252 --> 41:30.520
He sees the light.

41:30.554 --> 41:32.989
Does that mean he
forgives himself?

41:36.260 --> 41:39.396
Will you tell her I
see my dad in there?

41:40.331 --> 41:43.400
And he's smiling.

41:43.434 --> 41:46.036
I will.

41:51.942 --> 41:55.378
He's gone.

42:06.023 --> 42:08.258
Mom, dad?

42:08.292 --> 42:11.761
All my friends get much
more allowance than I do.

42:11.796 --> 42:13.063
Can I maybe have a raise? Ahh...

42:13.097 --> 42:14.030
No. Money corrupts.

42:14.065 --> 42:15.565
I don't want to spoil him.

42:15.599 --> 42:17.801
Babe, he gets 25 cents a week.

42:17.835 --> 42:19.302
That's a quarter.

42:19.337 --> 42:22.072
Ok, how about 30 cents?

42:22.106 --> 42:25.442
Sorry. Ghost on the brain.

42:25.476 --> 42:27.444
You decide.

42:27.478 --> 42:30.413
I'm gonna take out the trash.

42:30.448 --> 42:32.449
Look, 30 cents is
better than nothing.

Sync by YYeTs.net

42:42.693 --> 42:45.195
Carl! What are you doing here?

42:45.229 --> 42:46.329
I thought you'd want to know,

42:46.364 --> 42:48.331
We have new information.

42:48.366 --> 42:49.532
Ok. What?

42:49.567 --> 42:51.935
Even though no one can
see them but Aiden,

42:51.969 --> 42:53.803
We've observed a few things,

42:53.838 --> 42:56.272
Talked to ghosts who've
encountered them and survived...

42:56.307 --> 42:58.575
You mean the shadows. Right.

42:58.609 --> 43:00.310
I sense them sometimes,

43:00.344 --> 43:03.380
And I'll suddenly feel so
confused about everything.

43:03.447 --> 43:05.448
It's like they're
getting inside my head.

43:05.483 --> 43:07.584
You said you observed things,
like what?

43:07.618 --> 43:10.820
They're just insatiable
gluttons for energy.

43:10.855 --> 43:12.655
So is that good news or bad news?

43:12.690 --> 43:13.923
They're dangerous, Melinda,

43:13.958 --> 43:15.358
Because they can't
be reasoned with.

43:15.393 --> 43:16.726
They're like your cop friend,

43:16.761 --> 43:17.894
The one you just sent

43:17.928 --> 43:19.028
To jail.

43:19.063 --> 43:20.463
But he wanted money.
You were saying

43:20.498 --> 43:21.464
That they're after energy.

43:21.499 --> 43:22.766
They're both about greed,

43:22.800 --> 43:25.869
And the flipside of greed is fear.

43:25.903 --> 43:27.937
Ok, so how do we scare them away?

43:27.972 --> 43:29.839
You don't want them afraid of you.

43:29.874 --> 43:32.542
That's when they want to hurt you,
or your son.

43:32.576 --> 43:35.245
Look, except for when they've tried
to consume children's ghosts,

43:35.279 --> 43:37.046
I have left the shadows alone.

43:37.081 --> 43:38.448
All right, but you can't ask me

43:38.482 --> 43:39.549
To let them take children.

43:39.583 --> 43:41.217
I'm not asking anything.

43:41.252 --> 43:44.187
I'm just helping you understand.

43:44.221 --> 43:46.990
Greed and fear.

43:47.024 --> 43:48.925
And if you had to
focus on one of those,

43:48.959 --> 43:51.694
I'd make it fear.
