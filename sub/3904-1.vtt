WEBVTT

00:11.261 --> 00:13.924
I dunno, man.
I mean, I'm kinda sad.

00:14.416 --> 00:15.988
Them towers be home to me.

00:16.926 --> 00:18.859
You gonna cry over
a housing project, now?

00:19.399 --> 00:22.588
Man, they shoulda blew them motherfuckers up
a long time ago, you ask me.

00:22.659 --> 00:23.972
Man, it ain't all been bad.

00:24.485 --> 00:28.498
I mean, I been seen some shit happen up
in them towers it still make me smile, yo.

00:28.867 --> 00:32.689
A few moments from now,
the Franklin Terrace towers behind me,

00:33.052 --> 00:37.754
which sadly came to represent
some of the city's most entrenched problems,

00:37.989 --> 00:38.799
will be gone.

00:39.301 --> 00:41.272
Ya'll talkin' about steel
and concrete, man.

00:41.354 --> 00:43.947
- Steel and fucking concrete.
- Man, I'm talkin' about people.

00:44.123 --> 00:45.226
Memories an' shit.

00:46.093 --> 00:46.962
Ain't the same.

00:47.522 --> 00:50.724
Look, they gonna tear this building down,
they gonna build some new shit.

00:50.735 --> 00:51.248
But people?

00:51.305 --> 00:52.946
They don't give
a fuck about people.

00:52.986 --> 00:56.217
You are very soon
going to see low

00:56.218 --> 00:59.775
and moderately priced houses
built in their place.

01:01.214 --> 01:02.816
My cousins used
to live in 2-2-1.

01:02.857 --> 01:05.519
- I used to be up in there all the time.
- Ma who you tellin'?

01:05.555 --> 01:07.162
I caught my first
pussy up in there.

01:07.677 --> 01:08.766
The girl Chantay.

01:09.180 --> 01:10.886
Man, why didn't you
say something before?

01:10.897 --> 01:13.068
They probably wouldn't be
tearin' this tower down now.

01:13.075 --> 01:15.068
They gonna put a big-ass
sign in front sayin'

01:15.093 --> 01:17.322
"here's where Malik Carr
first got his dick wet".

01:17.333 --> 01:18.371
You know what I'm sayin'.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.215
Poot, you can be takin' pictures,
tourists takin' pictures an' shit,

01:21.223 --> 01:22.857
souvenirs of your dick
about this size.

01:22.865 --> 01:24.426
He ain't funny, yo,
he just jealous.

01:24.742 --> 01:27.322
What? Jealous of that?
You crazy, Chantay?

01:27.440 --> 01:29.586
Man, the mention of that
bitch make my dick burn.

01:29.610 --> 01:31.123
Yo, ain't no bad pussy, fool.

01:31.134 --> 01:33.926
Yeah, that's what they keep tellin'
your ass down at the clinic, man.

01:33.950 --> 01:34.686
Keep that shit up.

01:34.697 --> 01:37.647
You ever see this motherfucker
when he walkin' down to the clinic burnt?

01:37.669 --> 01:38.409
Poot be like this.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.306
He looks like a backward
ass cowboy an' shit.

01:40.314 --> 01:41.187
Instead of like this.

01:41.199 --> 01:42.298
Only he walkin' like this.

01:42.329 --> 01:44.194
Dick lookin' like
a fried chicken wing.

01:44.218 --> 01:45.626
Mistakes have been made.

01:46.342 --> 01:49.101
And we will learn
from those mistakes.

01:49.688 --> 01:52.867
Reform is not just a watchword
with my administration, unh-huh,

01:53.044 --> 01:54.416
no, it's a philosophy.

01:54.721 --> 01:57.079
Shit, no matter how many
times you get burnt, man,

01:57.200 --> 01:58.716
you just keep on
doin' the same.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.027
Nigger do not learn.

02:02.118 --> 02:03.924
Now, what do you say, huh?

02:04.311 --> 02:06.881
Are you ready
for a new Baltimore?

02:06.928 --> 02:08.650

the hook, yo.

02:08.732 --> 02:11.383
Man, my whole life been

02:11.641 --> 02:12.650
I mean I feel.

02:13.131 --> 02:15.322
Shit, I feel like
I don't got no home now.

02:15.401 --> 02:18.263
Housing just moved your mama
up off Poplar Prove, didn't they?

02:19.307 --> 02:21.067
You ain't homeless,

02:21.337 --> 02:23.308
Shit, you just damn

06:25.954 --> 06:27.726
<i>- It's nothin' you let him know.

06:27.750 --> 06:30.882
"Saddle up an' put another
bat on the motherfucker?"

06:31.515 --> 06:33.529
"Settle" up
and put another "bet".

06:35.569 --> 06:36.858
But what was that last part?

06:37.163 --> 06:39.580
Man said, "he need
to deal with me today

06:39.604 --> 06:41.844
or I'ma take it to
someone who can handle them. "

06:42.407 --> 06:44.170
Girl, you do have an ear.

06:56.547 --> 06:58.037
<i>He lookin'

<i>A-ight. </i>

What'r you seeing?

07:22.464 --> 07:24.387
Call comes in
to Cheese's number two,

07:25.026 --> 07:27.066
he whispers in the man's
ear and off they go.

07:27.688 --> 07:29.096
Yeah.
Nothing to the call here.

07:29.506 --> 07:30.363
<i>Figured that. </i>

07:33.143 --> 07:34.282
These guys come correct.

07:35.982 --> 07:37.648
The phones only go so far,

07:37.684 --> 07:40.260
above that, it's all done
as a face-to-face meet.

07:45.229 --> 07:49.114
Three months and we've
yet to hear his voice.

07:51.260 --> 07:54.697
And Herc takes the alley
to cut that off from Calhoun.

07:54.791 --> 07:57.523
So, me an' Truck go up the wrong
way on Stricker Street?

07:57.779 --> 07:59.033
You gotta badge, remember?

07:59.538 --> 08:01.204
And we're doing
the same one block over.

08:01.227 --> 08:03.245
So they can't go to ground
in that block neither.

08:03.315 --> 08:05.818
Now the thing is when we jump
out on these little cocksuckers,

08:05.837 --> 08:07.174
there'll be
a designated runner.

08:07.209 --> 08:09.322
Who's gonna sky up just so
we get to chase his ass.

08:09.333 --> 08:09.888
But fuck him.

08:10.126 --> 08:12.649
We let him go and jack every
other motherfucker who stays.

08:13.846 --> 08:14.527
Let's mount up.

08:18.570 --> 08:18.899
Carv.

08:27.085 --> 08:28.510
He's a complicated man.

08:28.820 --> 08:31.037
And the only one who
understands him is his woman.

08:32.842 --> 08:33.477
Seek therapy.

08:44.510 --> 08:46.186
Narcos! Back off!

08:54.220 --> 08:54.995
See your hands.

08:55.030 --> 08:57.076
See your hands.
Against the wall.

08:57.649 --> 08:59.501
Hands up. Get your hands up.

08:59.583 --> 09:01.041
Get your hands up against the wall.

09:04.403 --> 09:05.553
<i>There he goes. </i>

09:07.133 --> 09:08.999
Later son, step light!

09:12.471 --> 09:13.973
Yo, was that the stash?

09:14.688 --> 09:15.240
Fuck.

09:17.743 --> 09:19.677
Let's go, let's go,
cut him off at Stricker!

09:32.263 --> 09:33.342
<i>I've got Calhoun. </i>

09:33.763 --> 09:34.796
<i>Where you at?</i>

09:50.609 --> 09:53.166
Lost him.
Rear Stricker 800 block.

09:53.248 --> 09:54.632
Clear on Riggs.

10:00.542 --> 10:03.758
He just went across Stricker
in an alley headed for Gilmore.

10:13.690 --> 10:14.160
Fuck.

10:15.008 --> 10:17.287
We have rabbit in the alleys
near Gilmore and Riggs.

10:17.309 --> 10:18.239
How bout some back up?

10:18.278 --> 10:19.111
<i>Roger that. </i>

10:30.044 --> 10:32.039
<i>Dozerman, what's your 20?</i>

10:32.128 --> 10:33.571
<i>Hey, Doze,
where you at, man?</i>

10:33.991 --> 10:35.862
<i>He's across Stricker,
definitely. </i>

10:36.261 --> 10:38.044
Everybody to Lambert's 20.

10:44.165 --> 10:46.992
Who's the man who would risk
his neck for his brother man?

10:53.433 --> 10:55.144
<i>He went to ground
in this block, man. </i>

11:02.233 --> 11:04.522
Hey, listen to me you little
fuckin' piece of shit!

11:04.709 --> 11:07.173
I'ma tell you one thing,
and one thing only

11:07.255 --> 11:09.401
about the Western boys
you are playing with!

11:10.094 --> 11:11.583
We do not lose!

11:12.674 --> 11:14.416
And we do not forget!

11:14.791 --> 11:16.128
And we do not give up!

11:16.973 --> 11:17.488
Ever!

11:18.556 --> 11:20.456
So I'm only going
to say this one time:

11:20.644 --> 11:23.309
If you march your ass
out here right now

11:23.426 --> 11:24.984
and put the bracelets on,

11:25.066 --> 11:28.079
we will not kick
the living shit out of you!

11:28.831 --> 11:31.094
But if you make us go
into them weeds for you,

11:31.269 --> 11:33.557
or if you make us come back
out here tomorrow night,

11:33.616 --> 11:34.660
catch you on a corner.

11:34.859 --> 11:36.536
I swear to fucking Christ

11:36.772 --> 11:38.168
we will beat you longer

11:38.215 --> 11:40.526
and harder than you
beat your own dick!

11:43.998 --> 11:46.320
'Cause you do not
get to win, shitbird!

11:46.649 --> 11:47.232
We do!

11:58.633 --> 11:59.759
With these towers down,

12:00.030 --> 12:01.928
we need to take
the rest of them low-rises

12:02.116 --> 12:03.571
an' all them Fayette
Street corners.

12:04.228 --> 12:04.744
Take 'em?

12:05.670 --> 12:07.054
Take 'em how, Mr. Bodie?

12:08.310 --> 12:09.746
Ya say fuck it and take 'em.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.107
Nigga, you ain't
got the floor.

12:11.142 --> 12:12.627
The chair don't
recognize your ass.

12:12.926 --> 12:13.630
Take 'em how?

12:14.486 --> 12:15.565
I dunno, just...

12:16.585 --> 12:18.075

niggers know,

12:18.076 --> 12:19.565

12:19.600 --> 12:21.253
You know, get or get got.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.593
Yeah, yeah, like you did
on McCulloh Street last year?

12:23.615 --> 12:25.121
Snatch the real estate,
load up,

12:25.132 --> 12:27.244
and just wait for some
shit to happen, right?

12:28.347 --> 12:30.917
Naw, man, we done worryin'
about territory, man.

12:30.964 --> 12:33.003
What corner we got,
what project?

12:33.427 --> 12:34.758
Game ain't about that no more.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.071
It's about product.

12:37.302 --> 12:37.853
Yeah.

12:39.260 --> 12:40.820
And we got the best
goddamn product

12:40.821 --> 12:43.003
so we gonna sell no matter
where we are, right?

12:44.246 --> 12:45.572
Product, motherfuckers.

12:46.569 --> 12:47.145
Product.

12:48.822 --> 12:50.768
Chair recognize Slim Charles.

12:52.071 --> 12:55.225
Chair, our people got to stand
somewhere, don't it?

12:55.858 --> 12:58.248
I mean, all the product
in the world don't mean nothin'

12:58.414 --> 13:00.307
if you constantly
getting your ass whooped

13:00.326 --> 13:02.062
for standin' on another
fool's corner.

13:02.120 --> 13:02.613
A- ight.

13:03.786 --> 13:05.990
We had six of the towers
of the Terrace right,

13:06.424 --> 13:08.995
all running 24/7,
but three of those we had

13:09.006 --> 13:11.446
to give to Prop Joe's people
to upgrade the package

13:11.482 --> 13:13.116
that we was
puttin' out there, right?

13:13.171 --> 13:14.965
Now how much you think
we lost in the deal?

13:18.108 --> 13:19.890
Alright, the answer
is we made more.

13:20.595 --> 13:22.283
Half the real estate,
twice the product.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.330
And our profit went up
like eight, nine percent.

13:25.354 --> 13:26.268
Yo, get it straight.

13:26.291 --> 13:29.364
Your territory ain't gonna mean
shit if your product's weak.

13:29.599 --> 13:31.147
Go ahead and ask
them motherfuckers

13:31.183 --> 13:33.904
tryin' to sell them Ford Tempos
an' you got niggas ridin' around

13:33.928 --> 13:36.870
in Japanese and German cars
in America all day.

13:36.940 --> 13:38.054
Territory ain't shit.

13:39.264 --> 13:40.578
Especially when you consider

13:41.141 --> 13:42.666
it's the fight
for the territory

13:42.971 --> 13:44.297
that be bringin' the bodies.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.878
And the bodies that
bring the police.

13:47.417 --> 13:48.848
Yeah, but how
we gonna stand...

13:48.883 --> 13:51.183
Yo, chair ain't
recognize your ass, man.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.456
- How we gonna stand on some...
- Come on, man.

14:00.438 --> 14:02.656
How we gonna stand on some
corner that's not ours?

14:02.773 --> 14:04.486
Well, we got
the best product, right?

14:05.271 --> 14:07.472
So the chances are,
we gonna be able to bring in

14:07.507 --> 14:11.406
the competition by offering the
re-up with us from our package.

14:12.187 --> 14:12.984
Feel me?

14:13.360 --> 14:15.677
Everybody makin' money,
sharing the real estate.

14:16.674 --> 14:17.344
Slim Charles?

14:18.892 --> 14:20.792
What if they don't
cop our re-up though?

14:22.225 --> 14:24.043
Well, I'ma worry about
that when it happen.

14:25.673 --> 14:26.926
Until then, Mr. Charles,

14:26.948 --> 14:28.866
we gonna handle this shit
like businessmen.

14:29.876 --> 14:31.985
Sell the shit,
make the profit and later

14:32.149 --> 14:33.394
for that gangster bullshit.

14:35.002 --> 14:35.458
Yeah?

14:36.776 --> 14:38.207
Do the chair
know we gonna look

14:38.230 --> 14:39.908
like some punk-ass
bitches out there?

14:39.932 --> 14:42.295
Motherfucker, I will punk
your ass for sayin' such shit!

14:42.313 --> 14:43.350
- Yo, String.
- What?!

14:43.362 --> 14:44.641
Poot did have the floor, man.

14:44.688 --> 14:45.701
Shut the fuck up, man!

14:45.725 --> 14:47.954
This nigga too ignorant
to have the fuckin' floor.

14:53.491 --> 14:55.497
Y'all niggas need to start
lookin' at the world

14:55.515 --> 14:56.477
in a new fucking light.

14:56.500 --> 14:59.433
Start thinkin' about this shit
like some grown fucking men,

14:59.806 --> 15:01.542
not some niggas
off the fuckin' corner.

15:01.582 --> 15:02.227
You heard me?

15:07.110 --> 15:08.225
Adjourn your asses.

15:21.650 --> 15:23.280
Y'all look like shit.

15:23.281 --> 15:25.662
We been stuck in that
vacant since before dawn.

15:26.307 --> 15:27.259
How should we look?

15:27.481 --> 15:29.237
Proud to know you, Detective.

15:36.750 --> 15:37.993
Nice look on you.

15:38.934 --> 15:40.142
Dress for success.

15:43.146 --> 15:46.349
I watched that motherfucker
Cheese take re-ups,

15:46.361 --> 15:48.245
move weight all day
and not once did he go

15:48.269 --> 15:49.558
near a fucking telephone.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.022
Closest it comes
is a call to a hanger-on's

15:52.057 --> 15:53.382
cellphone 10 feet away.

15:53.769 --> 15:56.057
Which brings me back
to what I was just discussing

15:56.087 --> 15:56.966
with the Lieutenant.

15:57.401 --> 15:59.535
So far, we've been up
on some of these cellphones

15:59.546 --> 16:01.659
for nearly six months,
the only drug talk we have

16:01.699 --> 16:03.118
is from street-level small fry.

16:04.608 --> 16:06.892
So, the feeling is
that maybe two weeks from now,

16:06.927 --> 16:09.180
we don't go back to the court
for another extension.

16:09.215 --> 16:11.619
<i>We charge what we have,
we try to roll someone up</i>

16:11.643 --> 16:13.566
<i>at Cheese or one of Joe's
other lieutenants. </i>

16:13.613 --> 16:14.343
Are you kidding?

16:14.364 --> 16:16.101
We don't have
a case worth making yet.

16:16.218 --> 16:17.721
And at this rate,
we never will.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.292
For chrissake.

16:19.362 --> 16:21.179
<i>As a plan on paper
it was a good one:</i>

16:21.352 --> 16:22.949
We came out of
the port investigation

16:22.984 --> 16:25.200
with good phone numbers
for some of Prop Joe's people

16:25.223 --> 16:26.936
and the P.C. To get up
on those phones.

16:26.947 --> 16:29.082
I guarantee if we can push
this thing a level or two

16:29.117 --> 16:31.698
above the street we're gonna
start seeing Prop Joe himself.

16:31.792 --> 16:33.924
We start seeing Joe,
we're gonna see Stringer.

16:33.948 --> 16:36.611
I can't ask for more time
on a wire that's going nowhere.

16:39.403 --> 16:41.619
Either we figure a way
to punch through the wall,

16:41.654 --> 16:42.510
or we let it go.

16:44.269 --> 16:45.548
<i>- Baker.
- Yes, Sir. </i>

16:46.744 --> 16:47.835
<i>So you must be Castor. </i>

16:48.106 --> 16:50.030
Yes, Sir.
Officer Aaron Castor.

16:50.124 --> 16:51.508
<i>You any kin
to Lloyd Castor?</i>

16:51.672 --> 16:52.893
Yes, Sir, that's my uncle.

16:53.560 --> 16:54.404
<i>Good police. </i>

16:58.375 --> 16:59.688
Do you know where you are?

17:00.933 --> 17:02.387
You too. Where are you?

17:02.493 --> 17:03.338
The Western, Major?

17:03.585 --> 17:04.934
Right this very goddamn second

17:04.945 --> 17:06.505
you're getting your
hindparts kicked

17:06.516 --> 17:08.270
and you're on the horn
screaming for help.

17:08.297 --> 17:10.420
And you got your backup
lookin' all over the place,

17:10.442 --> 17:12.330
'cause you don't know
where the fuck you are.

17:12.354 --> 17:15.214
And that means I got
to explain to your next of kin

17:15.450 --> 17:18.372
how you went and got
yourselves killed on my watch.

17:18.426 --> 17:21.944
Sir, we're at 1034 North Mount,
first floor rear.

17:22.086 --> 17:22.590
Good.

17:24.151 --> 17:25.173
Now which way's north?

17:26.479 --> 17:27.088
Point.

17:30.807 --> 17:31.769
That's east.

17:34.534 --> 17:37.056
Now, don't you think
if you're in a foot pursuit,

17:37.091 --> 17:38.616
it might help
your backup to know

17:38.640 --> 17:40.059
what direction
you're running?

17:47.504 --> 17:50.426
Even numbers tell you
north and west,

17:51.094 --> 17:52.536
odd, south and east.

17:54.848 --> 17:55.576
Compasses.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.505
'Til you learn that much,
you carry one.

18:03.665 --> 18:04.767
Welcome to the Western.

18:05.846 --> 18:08.067
<i>Gentlemen?
Scuff yourselves up a little. </i>

18:08.735 --> 18:09.815
And learn the stare.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.087
Hey Carv, where you at?

18:17.217 --> 18:19.070
I'm at a desk outside
the roll call room

18:19.082 --> 18:20.852
on the first floor of
1034 North Mount.

18:20.864 --> 18:22.119
And my feet
are facing west

18:22.130 --> 18:23.938
and my dick is
pointing south, southwest.

18:25.299 --> 18:27.077
Bunny Colvin's been
giving that speech

18:27.086 --> 18:28.762
as long as you guys
been sucking air.

18:32.714 --> 18:33.828
Where you at, shitbird?

18:34.472 --> 18:36.150
You're in handcuffs,
in my house,

18:36.186 --> 18:37.464
lookin' stupid, ain't you?

18:44.305 --> 18:45.396
Fleeing and eluding?

18:46.792 --> 18:48.257
Do we have
a drug charge here?

18:48.281 --> 18:50.779
Loitering in a designated
drug-free zone.

18:51.015 --> 18:53.161
Let me re-phrase.
Do we have drugs?

18:53.370 --> 18:55.974
He raised up when we hit his
corner and he grabbed this bag.

18:56.033 --> 18:57.605
We pursued
and recovered the bag.

18:58.239 --> 18:59.142
But no drugs.

18:59.271 --> 19:00.327
An' they whipped my ass.

19:00.597 --> 19:01.579
The Western District way.

19:02.096 --> 19:03.093
So, what do we learn?

19:03.515 --> 19:05.574
Using half my district,
canine and the copter

19:05.585 --> 19:08.559
to bring a 14-year-old
to bay, what did we learn?

19:08.928 --> 19:11.437
That you can't raise up
and run from a drug corner

19:11.472 --> 19:14.334
in sector one without
my boot finding your ass.

19:15.634 --> 19:16.090
Right?

19:24.710 --> 19:27.184
I got it, I got it, I got it.
Got it, got it, got it.

19:27.723 --> 19:29.835
Cast-iron. 20 at least.

19:29.976 --> 19:31.313
It be better if it was copper.

19:31.325 --> 19:32.557
Be better if it was copper.

19:32.581 --> 19:33.824
It be better if it was gold.

19:33.859 --> 19:36.012
But you know you got to
take life as it goes along,

19:36.024 --> 19:36.481
you know?

19:36.950 --> 19:38.028
Oh shit, oh shit.

19:44.004 --> 19:45.507
- What's wrong with you!?
- Sorry.

19:45.553 --> 19:46.466
You past sorry.

19:47.278 --> 19:48.005
Chill, chill.

19:48.017 --> 19:49.178
We don't mean this, man.

19:49.706 --> 19:51.208
You think you fucked up now.

19:52.756 --> 19:53.330
S'up?

19:53.846 --> 19:55.204
Look what they
did to my ride.

19:57.952 --> 19:58.856
Do it or don't.

19:58.926 --> 20:00.170
But I got someplace to be.

20:05.677 --> 20:06.990
Thank you for your kindness.

20:07.131 --> 20:08.809
<i>Y'all got to
pay something, anything!</i>

20:08.984 --> 20:10.192
<i>Be a principle here. </i>

20:10.215 --> 20:11.975
If we had a dime,
you would have a dime.

20:11.985 --> 20:13.734
We a little insufficient
right now, okay?

20:13.770 --> 20:15.094
We on our way
to the metal man.

20:15.106 --> 20:17.310
We'll come back and pay for
everything I promise you.

20:24.897 --> 20:28.159
Hey, hey, after this junk, man,
we gotta rolpast K-Mart.

20:29.496 --> 20:30.140
Definitely.

20:31.888 --> 20:33.351
One last question,
Commissioner.

20:33.386 --> 20:35.276
Looking back over
the past couple months,

20:35.287 --> 20:37.421
if I read the felony
breakdowns correctly,

20:37.433 --> 20:39.382
you've been seeing
an uptick in shootings

20:39.417 --> 20:41.927
and serious assaults in
the Eastern District especially.

20:42.056 --> 20:44.459
Can we assume that you're
already addressing this?

20:45.491 --> 20:47.274
Let me throw
that over to Bill.

20:47.450 --> 20:49.373
As Deputy for Operations,

20:49.783 --> 20:51.883
I'm sure he's got
a handle on our response.

20:52.943 --> 20:53.987
I do indeed.

20:55.336 --> 20:57.142
In answer to your question,
Councilman,

20:57.590 --> 21:00.357
I can assure you that we put
additional tactical teams

21:00.369 --> 21:03.373
on a seven-to-three shift
in every eastern sector.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.727
Additionally, we've put
the district flex squad

21:06.124 --> 21:07.263
on a seven-to-three shift

21:08.273 --> 21:09.630
being as those are the hours

21:09.654 --> 21:11.730
when we're seeing a spike
in aggravated assaults.

21:13.173 --> 21:14.076
Thank you, Deputy.

21:15.166 --> 21:18.451
Anything else for
these esteemed constables?

21:18.651 --> 21:19.065
No?

21:19.581 --> 21:20.555
Okay, then I guess

21:20.578 --> 21:23.464
I'll see you all tomorrow night
for the quarterly budget review.

21:33.519 --> 21:34.846
Erv, hey, you don't mind,

21:34.881 --> 21:36.992
I'd like to get with
you about a couple things.

21:37.038 --> 21:37.953
Can we get lunch?

21:38.845 --> 21:40.147
Glad to, Mr. Chairman.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.580
How 'bout Werner's
in half hour?

21:42.939 --> 21:44.404
Half hour. Good.

21:50.294 --> 21:52.230
- You see Watkins in the back?
- Yeah.

21:53.613 --> 21:54.974
Who's that skirt with him?

21:57.191 --> 21:58.759
<i>That's him there
in the orange?</i>

21:59.264 --> 22:00.179
<i>That's Drac. </i>

22:01.846 --> 22:03.148
Our last best hope.

22:04.214 --> 22:06.959
The talkingest motherfucker
I ever heard on a wiretap.

22:07.474 --> 22:08.120
Listen.

22:08.706 --> 22:11.943
<i>No, no, the other thing.
The other thing, nigga. </i>

22:12.002 --> 22:13.257
<i>You talkin' about him. </i>

22:13.339 --> 22:15.100
<i>No, her, I mean her. </i>

22:15.858 --> 22:16.433
<i>Oh. </i>

22:17.372 --> 22:19.155
<i>Cocaine, nigga,
you feel me now?</i>

22:19.166 --> 22:20.250
<i>Goddamn, you ignorant. </i>

22:20.285 --> 22:22.385
When was the last time
you heard that on a wire?

22:22.408 --> 22:24.391
Shame he doesn't report
to anyone who matters.

22:24.447 --> 22:27.914
Right now, Drac's reups
are with Lavell Manns,

22:28.643 --> 22:30.895
he's got those corners
over on Preston and Bond.

22:31.001 --> 22:32.814
And is pretty close
to selling us weight.

22:32.872 --> 22:33.255
No shit.

22:33.279 --> 22:35.976
Sydnor's been working toward him
for a couple of months now.

22:35.999 --> 22:36.948
Lavell's a soldier.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.580
He's not gonna
roll up on Prop Joe.

22:39.143 --> 22:40.093
That's true.

22:40.492 --> 22:42.568
But if we take him off
with a hand-to-hand,

22:42.756 --> 22:44.763
they gotta promote
someone to replace him.

22:44.950 --> 22:45.694
Why Drac?

22:46.597 --> 22:47.935
One thing about our boy?

22:48.298 --> 22:50.012
That's Prop Joe's nephew.

22:50.094 --> 22:52.005
On his momma's side.

23:04.159 --> 23:06.460
20 and two.

23:09.137 --> 23:11.012
Y'all know you
ain't got pants?

23:13.675 --> 23:15.798
And there's Dominic
standing in line,

23:17.005 --> 23:19.099
and when he finally
gets up to meet the President,

23:19.110 --> 23:20.342
who's looking the other way,

23:20.354 --> 23:21.890
Dominic reaches
around behind Carter,

23:21.914 --> 23:23.217
grabs his belt, yanks it up...

23:23.252 --> 23:24.660
secret service musta shit.

23:24.975 --> 23:27.458
He says, "hey, Mister
President, remember me?"

23:27.587 --> 23:29.477
And Carter,
actually remembers,

23:29.500 --> 23:31.364
"sure, Dominic Dipietro
from Baltimore,

23:31.387 --> 23:32.748
on the campaign trail".

23:33.312 --> 23:34.660
And Dominic
doesn't miss a beat.

23:34.682 --> 23:36.736
He puts a finger in Jimmy
Carter's face and says,

23:36.758 --> 23:39.034
"so where's that money you
promised me three years ago

23:39.056 --> 23:40.544
to fix up my streets
and alleys?"

23:40.566 --> 23:41.115
Unbelievable.

23:41.128 --> 23:41.773
That's nothing.

23:41.784 --> 23:43.826
After losing to Reagan,
Carter comes back here

23:43.850 --> 23:45.973
to speak at a Jefferson-Jackson
dinner or something,

23:46.020 --> 23:47.349
and Dominic's
ushered up to him.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.413
Carter asks about
his health and Dominic says:

23:49.496 --> 23:51.712
"You sonofabitch,
I'm still waiting on that money

23:51.736 --> 23:52.921
for my streets and alleys".

23:52.944 --> 23:54.587
- Come on.
- No shit.

23:55.068 --> 23:57.644
Carter's just grinning
through those big teeth,

23:57.773 --> 24:00.166
some guy grabs Dominic's arm,
and off he goes.

24:00.213 --> 24:02.582
Guy says, "christ, Dominic,
you just called

24:02.606 --> 24:04.634
"the President of
the United States an S.O.B."

24:05.022 --> 24:06.708
He shrugs he says, "fuck 'im,

24:06.719 --> 24:08.045
I don't need him. He lost. "

24:10.696 --> 24:12.445
That's good. That is good.

24:15.249 --> 24:17.032
And that is from whence I come,

24:17.737 --> 24:19.789
proud son of the fighting
first district.

24:22.909 --> 24:23.847
But the truth is...

24:25.971 --> 24:28.520
I don't wanna be just another
muldoon like Dominic Dipietro,

24:29.001 --> 24:30.151
warming the backbench.

24:30.713 --> 24:32.838
Not with the way things
are right now in the city.

24:33.763 --> 24:36.109
We're losing 10, 12,000
residents a year

24:36.427 --> 24:38.745
and when you ask 'em why
they're moving to the county,

24:38.746 --> 24:39.825
you know what they say?

24:39.849 --> 24:40.530
Schools.

24:40.894 --> 24:41.809
And crime.

24:43.334 --> 24:44.824
Schools and crime

24:45.082 --> 24:47.347
and there goes our tax base
right across the line.

24:47.365 --> 24:49.042
And the Mayor's acting
like a 10% bump

24:49.054 --> 24:51.599
in the murder rate
is business as usual.

24:52.292 --> 24:52.961
Check, please?

24:54.120 --> 24:55.012
And you know what?

24:55.800 --> 24:58.955
If you were smart, you'd come
to me when the Mayor shorts you.

24:59.002 --> 25:02.065
On hiring, on equipment,
on overtime, on cars.

25:02.088 --> 25:03.788
You get the shit end
of the stick,

25:04.351 --> 25:05.172
you come to me.

25:05.852 --> 25:06.434
Not publicly.

25:06.457 --> 25:08.440
I know you can't cross
the Mayor publicly.

25:08.463 --> 25:09.964
But back door, you come to me

25:09.999 --> 25:12.698
and I can use that subcommittee
to give you what you need.

25:14.211 --> 25:14.634
Thanks.

25:16.822 --> 25:17.761
Kind offer.

25:18.124 --> 25:21.642
Erv, I can help you
and we can turn this thing...

25:21.666 --> 25:25.093
but long ago, when I was just
starting out in the department

25:25.714 --> 25:27.790
I had the good fortune
to be taught

25:27.813 --> 25:30.543
a little something
about chain of command.

25:30.906 --> 25:32.079
And right now,

25:32.548 --> 25:36.079
in my capacity as
Acting Commissioner,

25:40.279 --> 25:42.577
I report to Mayor Royce.

25:44.640 --> 25:45.650
I got your coffee.

25:46.659 --> 25:47.832
Leave a tip if you want.

25:55.980 --> 25:57.541
<i>So, what do you need
to see me for?</i>

25:57.575 --> 25:58.866
Gettin' out tomorrow, right?

25:58.889 --> 25:59.159
Yeah.

25:59.932 --> 26:01.314
He probably
tryin' to reach out.

26:02.466 --> 26:03.504
What you
gonna do first?

26:03.974 --> 26:04.314
Huh?

26:04.923 --> 26:06.544
Tomorrow, what you gonna do?

26:09.229 --> 26:09.839
I dunno.

26:10.648 --> 26:11.786
I know what be first.

26:12.009 --> 26:13.815
You don't know?
I know what be first.

26:17.164 --> 26:17.751
Time out.

26:32.595 --> 26:33.510
<i>Back in. </i>

26:40.120 --> 26:40.918
Short-timer.

26:42.630 --> 26:44.272
You only got
the one day left, huh.

26:44.295 --> 26:46.198
You done the one,
just got to do the other.

26:46.221 --> 26:47.250
Like they say...

26:48.457 --> 26:49.818
you only do two days.

26:50.463 --> 26:52.563
- It's the day you go in.
- The day you come out.

26:52.645 --> 26:55.260
I don't know, I did 14 years.

26:56.816 --> 26:57.904
Yeah, well,

26:57.954 --> 27:00.102
you know you did you
a little stretch there, true.

27:00.114 --> 27:01.580
But you still
a soldier, right?

27:05.966 --> 27:07.963
You know them towers
came down now, huh?

27:08.631 --> 27:10.251
The Terrace,
the Murphy homes.

27:10.262 --> 27:11.564
All that shit is gone, man.

27:11.764 --> 27:14.367
A lot of things are different
now since you been up in here.

27:14.368 --> 27:14.871
You'll see.

27:14.895 --> 27:15.635
Lotta changes.

27:16.362 --> 27:17.172
Yeah, no doubt.

27:17.516 --> 27:19.205
But I mean you know, shit,

27:19.206 --> 27:20.835
some things they
stay the same, man.

27:20.859 --> 27:22.477
I mean,
the game's the game.

27:23.404 --> 27:24.342
And the thing is,

27:24.694 --> 27:26.620
since the towers gone,
I'm gonna need to take

27:26.655 --> 27:28.484
my thing to some new places.
Feel me?

27:29.870 --> 27:32.205
You know I'ma be home
soon enough, right?

27:33.167 --> 27:34.680
First parole hearing, I'm out.

27:35.172 --> 27:35.654
For real.

27:36.158 --> 27:37.213
Shit is fixed right.

27:38.128 --> 27:39.019
I come home.

27:40.669 --> 27:43.613
Shit, there's gonna be
a little hell to be paid.

27:43.625 --> 27:44.728
You know, what I mean?

27:45.279 --> 27:47.109
A good soldier ain't
gonna lack for work.

27:50.533 --> 27:51.811
Take that number, man.

27:52.327 --> 27:53.441
When you out, you call.

27:55.435 --> 27:57.184
We'll hook you up,
man, no problem.

27:58.239 --> 28:00.738
Like a coming-home
gift, a-ight.

28:03.340 --> 28:04.031
Call it.

28:10.482 --> 28:11.784
Joint mighta broke him.

28:14.670 --> 28:16.653
Boss, you talkin' about
a homey walked up

28:16.676 --> 28:18.622
an' shot Elijah Davis

28:18.986 --> 28:19.971
in broad daylight

28:20.570 --> 28:22.166
at Pennsie and Gold,

28:23.057 --> 28:24.594
then picked up the phone,

28:24.711 --> 28:26.084
dialed 9-1-1, told the police,

28:26.119 --> 28:27.890
"I just shot a nigger,
come get him".

28:29.648 --> 28:31.079
And do they break him?

28:32.873 --> 28:33.306
Naw.

28:38.116 --> 28:41.002
Look we had the 20, you know,
we had to go buy some pants,

28:41.061 --> 28:43.635
so if you just take
this short money,

28:43.776 --> 28:45.219
we get back at you
tomorrow, man.

28:45.220 --> 28:46.569
We get you on the comeback.

28:48.939 --> 28:50.535
He want two for 16.

28:50.717 --> 28:53.006
<i>Tell him to get two.
Tell him to get two. </i>

28:53.017 --> 28:54.413
<i>This young motherfucker. </i>

28:56.841 --> 28:57.205
Naw.

28:57.755 --> 28:59.527
You see we
a little short now,

28:59.562 --> 29:01.741
but tomorrow, I be right
back here with the four.

29:01.753 --> 29:02.727
Joey said "no".

29:05.823 --> 29:07.265
Fucking guy, man.

29:12.412 --> 29:16.003
At these prices, I can't
afford more phone surveillance.

29:16.965 --> 29:17.691
I'm aware of that

29:19.040 --> 29:19.834
and right now,

29:19.835 --> 29:22.416
the plan is to go for a
hand-to-hand on one lieutenant

29:22.439 --> 29:24.396
a couple rungs down
from Proposition Joe.

29:24.479 --> 29:26.063
And then roll
the lieutenant up?

29:28.856 --> 29:30.711
We don't think he'll
have much roll to him.

29:31.298 --> 29:32.728
Joe's people are
pretty schooled.

29:33.831 --> 29:35.999
The hope is that they promote
this mid-level dealer

29:36.021 --> 29:37.165
who's a fool to replace him.

29:37.198 --> 29:37.866
Name a Drac.

29:39.145 --> 29:40.278
We're on his cellphone,

29:40.431 --> 29:42.614
if he gets promoted,
maybe he talks to Joe

29:42.625 --> 29:43.564
or Joe's top people.

29:44.021 --> 29:46.532
We get that far, maybe
we start to see Stringer Bell.

29:48.877 --> 29:51.566
What makes you think they'll
promote the wrong man?

29:53.936 --> 29:55.215
We do it all the time.

30:00.389 --> 30:01.632
Look, speaking of promotions,

30:01.644 --> 30:03.955
I sent yours over to the hall.
As promised.

30:04.868 --> 30:05.220
And?

30:05.866 --> 30:07.109
The Mayor's holding it up.

30:07.719 --> 30:09.691
My understanding is
he wants to know

30:09.726 --> 30:11.157
what your wife is doing.

30:11.783 --> 30:13.072
- My wife?
- Yeah.

30:13.436 --> 30:15.031
There's a rumor
that she's going to

30:15.043 --> 30:16.310
take a run at
a council seat,

30:16.322 --> 30:18.293
maybe try to knock off
Eunetta Perkins.

30:19.466 --> 30:20.721
That's my wife's business.

30:20.990 --> 30:22.022
Yes, it is.

30:22.807 --> 30:25.072
But the Mayor counts
Eunetta as an ally.

30:25.307 --> 30:27.396
Our deal was
for a permanent unit

30:27.455 --> 30:28.920
and the next vacancy
for major.

30:29.153 --> 30:32.544
You got your unit and I sent
your name over to the hall.

30:33.225 --> 30:34.287
I kept my word.

30:36.598 --> 30:37.489
But the Mayor,

30:38.088 --> 30:39.928
he may want to know
who his friends are

30:39.952 --> 30:41.594
before he makes
a new commander.

30:45.922 --> 30:47.596
Where'd she say
she was gonna be at?

30:48.985 --> 30:51.064
Near the dugout, first-base side.

30:51.688 --> 30:52.443
She'll turn up.

30:52.487 --> 30:54.444
When she supposed
to bring 'em over to you?

30:54.520 --> 30:55.430
Middle of the fourth.

30:57.349 --> 30:58.978
Dad, can I have a hotdog?

31:00.232 --> 31:02.201
Yeah, as soon as
the guy comes around.

31:03.514 --> 31:05.309
Speaking of which,
where's the beer man?

31:09.488 --> 31:10.351
There they are.

31:15.503 --> 31:17.397
Oh, damn,
they got great seats.

31:17.866 --> 31:18.665
Ah, hell.

31:21.082 --> 31:21.466
What?

31:21.488 --> 31:23.392
The guy on her left, the suit.

31:25.220 --> 31:26.062
Just a friend.

31:26.663 --> 31:27.899
Nah, he's in the cake.

31:33.588 --> 31:35.229
Who goes to
an Orioles game in a suit,

31:35.251 --> 31:37.056
spends half the time
on a his cellphone?

31:37.231 --> 31:38.095
Downtown lawyer.

31:39.736 --> 31:40.917
Someone wealthy like that.

31:47.038 --> 31:48.253
<i>Wish we had more of it. </i>

31:48.733 --> 31:50.088
Long way to go
for half a shot.

31:52.376 --> 31:53.809
We'll do better
tomorrow, Bubs.

31:55.486 --> 31:59.359
What kinda dope fiend
be talkin' about tomorrow?

32:00.332 --> 32:01.404
Tomorrow ain't shit.

32:03.286 --> 32:03.996
Today, Johnny.

32:05.079 --> 32:08.205
Today I hunted down
all that metal,

32:08.905 --> 32:10.174
lugged it around like a dog,

32:12.330 --> 32:14.266
and nearly got kilt
over a scratch of metal

32:14.288 --> 32:15.687
so that I had to
beg for my life.

32:18.386 --> 32:20.616
Lost my trousers, man.
My fuckin' trousers.

32:22.138 --> 32:24.061
And then I'm beggin'
again for half a shot.

32:28.365 --> 32:30.138
Swear to god, man,
I'm not even high.

32:39.448 --> 32:41.045
We just missed
a foul pop.

32:41.078 --> 32:41.439
Yeah?

32:41.953 --> 32:42.970
Our seats are great.

32:43.101 --> 32:44.471
We're practically
on the field.

32:44.567 --> 32:46.548
Yeah my friend, Dennis,

32:46.559 --> 32:48.496
he gets company seats
every now and then.

32:48.793 --> 32:49.733
Where are you sitting?

32:50.370 --> 32:52.404
Mezzanine. Come on.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.068
- Aw...
- No, no, you guys go.

32:54.090 --> 32:55.540
Your dad hasn't
seen you all week.

32:55.566 --> 32:57.097
Now, don't take
their jackets off

32:57.130 --> 32:59.263
'cause Sean's just
getting over a cold. Okay?

33:00.029 --> 33:02.278
Jimmy, right?
Dennis Kerpelman.

33:04.248 --> 33:05.077
Great kids.

33:07.102 --> 33:08.338
Anyway, nice meeting you.

33:10.255 --> 33:11.819
You want anything
from the stand?

33:11.863 --> 33:13.110
No, thank you.

33:20.912 --> 33:23.527
Don't stay 'til the last inning
'cause it's a school night.

33:26.360 --> 33:26.699
Bye.

33:40.193 --> 33:42.337
You got spatter going in
two different directions,

33:42.358 --> 33:43.316
just off the curb.

33:47.218 --> 33:47.589
Yeah.

33:47.665 --> 33:48.814
<i>Shooting on the West Side. </i>

33:49.547 --> 33:50.170
Another one?

33:50.827 --> 33:51.581
Christ, where?

33:51.603 --> 33:53.244
North and Polanski,
Cole's up.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.783
Cole's working
a cutting off Belvedere.

33:55.879 --> 33:57.437
Call Crutchfield
and see if he's back

33:57.458 --> 33:58.415
from the Westport scene.

33:58.442 --> 33:59.089
<i>Crutchfield. </i>

33:59.111 --> 34:00.245
If not, call Bunk at home.

34:00.488 --> 34:01.593
<i>It's his off day. </i>

34:01.626 --> 34:02.796
Fuck his off-day.

34:09.583 --> 34:10.699
I love this town.

34:17.971 --> 34:20.399
Maz's kinda quick
to yank a pitcher, ain't he?

34:26.176 --> 34:27.862
I'm thinking
of becoming a woman.

34:37.038 --> 34:37.518
Office.

34:38.263 --> 34:38.668
Yeah.

34:41.676 --> 34:42.684
I'm at the ball game.

34:44.498 --> 34:45.516
The ball game.

34:50.847 --> 34:52.302
Yeah, what about Cole?
Call him.

34:54.797 --> 34:55.661
Ah, shit.

34:58.888 --> 34:59.466
Alright.

35:03.820 --> 35:05.890
Can you believe this?
They caught five tonight,

35:05.913 --> 35:08.033
they're telling me I gotta
come in on my day off.

35:09.031 --> 35:09.512
Five?

35:11.131 --> 35:12.651
City's jumpin' bad, man.

35:15.070 --> 35:16.152
Hey, listen,

35:17.782 --> 35:19.651
- I gotta go to work, alright?
- Alright.

35:21.818 --> 35:23.842
Mr. Jimmy's gonna...

35:25.362 --> 35:26.686
He's gonna take you home.

35:29.530 --> 35:30.799
You're on your own, partner.

36:33.953 --> 36:34.959
Mee-maw.

36:43.620 --> 36:44.757
And Ertman Avenue?

36:45.042 --> 36:46.399
No ballistic information.

36:47.701 --> 36:48.378
Are you sure?

36:50.578 --> 36:51.661
Take your time, Major.

36:53.553 --> 36:55.401
Can you believe
that cocksucker Carcetti?

36:55.434 --> 36:57.010
Thinkin' I'm talkin'
out of school.

36:57.349 --> 36:58.618
Any day now, Marvin.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.509
What can a white
councilman give me

37:00.728 --> 37:02.052
that a black mayor can't?

37:02.961 --> 37:04.251
No, you played it right.

37:04.339 --> 37:07.171
It was a 38 recorded
on Ertman Avenue, Sir.

37:07.291 --> 37:09.217
So what you are
in effect saying, Major,

37:09.458 --> 37:12.360
is rather than lookin'
at this cluster of robberies

37:12.404 --> 37:13.901
you had along
Monument Street,

37:14.603 --> 37:17.413
you chose to investigate
each using separate personnel.

37:17.730 --> 37:18.707
No, Sir.

37:18.727 --> 37:20.728
Three of those cases
were commercial robberies

37:20.750 --> 37:22.490
so we sent those
downtown to C.I.D.

37:22.632 --> 37:24.785
My people had responsibility.

37:24.862 --> 37:26.010
Goddamnit, Marvin,

37:26.382 --> 37:29.948
did you just invoke the word
responsibility to explain why

37:29.970 --> 37:31.764
you didn't get on
top of this shit?

37:31.874 --> 37:32.933
Did you just do that?

37:33.009 --> 37:35.003
I don't think you know
what the word means

37:35.375 --> 37:37.946
when I look at
the 24s and plainly see

37:38.209 --> 37:41.786
that some 38 caliber asshole
is raping your entire district.

37:42.093 --> 37:45.833
All the way from Greenmount
to fucking Edison Highway.

37:46.089 --> 37:48.626
It's policing like that
makes it possible for us

37:48.648 --> 37:50.539
to get hit with
five fucking homicides

37:50.572 --> 37:52.434
in a single fucking
night people.

37:53.768 --> 37:56.186
Poor fucking Marvin.

37:56.219 --> 37:57.449
Better him than us, right?

37:57.671 --> 37:58.811
Based on your testimony,

37:58.830 --> 38:00.678
the buy itself will be
enough to charge.

38:00.700 --> 38:02.488
But you get him saying
something on tape,

38:02.505 --> 38:03.380
it's even better.

38:03.446 --> 38:05.787
Are you sure this guy wants
to be selling you weight?

38:05.962 --> 38:07.420
We don't want to be forcing this.

38:07.595 --> 38:09.590
I been strokin' this guy
for two months, man.

38:09.980 --> 38:11.325
That's not what
he asked you.

38:11.500 --> 38:12.966
The guy is ripe
and ready, Kima.

38:13.765 --> 38:14.759
It ain't no thing.

38:18.445 --> 38:19.429
They're about ready.

38:22.491 --> 38:24.138
You livin' out
of the office, Cedric?

38:31.722 --> 38:34.150
Alright. Drac is depending
on you people.

38:35.375 --> 38:36.042
Mount up.

38:42.290 --> 38:43.242
Find your way home.

38:51.639 --> 38:53.899
Look a little light to be
an ounce, don't you think?

38:53.957 --> 38:55.632
Naw, man,
ain't nuthin' light.

38:55.676 --> 38:57.961
It just settled is all.

38:58.181 --> 38:59.899
Weight, man, if it
does what it should,

38:59.921 --> 39:02.790
I'ma come back to you
for three, maybe four a week.

39:02.867 --> 39:03.709
That could work.

39:04.365 --> 39:04.955
We good then.

39:05.983 --> 39:06.684
We good.

39:06.727 --> 39:07.296
That's it.

39:07.362 --> 39:08.227
Take 'em down.

39:27.934 --> 39:29.827
- Somebody snitchin'.
- Shut the fuck up!

39:33.635 --> 39:34.575
Let's go, Lavell.

39:49.332 --> 39:49.999
This Cutty.

39:51.225 --> 39:52.603
Told I could call for help.

39:54.489 --> 39:55.584
What 'bout the oxbow?

39:56.514 --> 39:58.406
The oxbow
on Laurens, at Fulton.

39:59.521 --> 39:59.881
A- ight.

40:10.446 --> 40:12.666
<i>I'm sayin', they caught 'em
with a whole ounce. </i>

40:12.786 --> 40:14.638
<i>Might not be no bail
for that much weight. </i>

40:14.660 --> 40:17.385
<i>They might just take it federal,
run wild on they ass. </i>

40:17.636 --> 40:20.438
<i>And you know Joey's gotta give
Lavell's corner to someone right?</i>

40:20.460 --> 40:21.532
<i>Might be my turn. </i>

40:21.565 --> 40:22.965
Our boy won't shut up.

40:23.710 --> 40:25.649
Caroline, you say it like
it's a bad thing.

40:26.655 --> 40:29.926
Let's just hope we're listening
to a candidate for elevation.

40:45.713 --> 40:46.863
I heard about you, man.

40:48.219 --> 40:49.795
I hear your name
used to ring out.

40:50.495 --> 40:51.621
You got somethin' for me?

40:52.978 --> 40:54.838
You see where Shorty
sittin' right there,

40:55.628 --> 40:56.952
you find a little help.

40:57.379 --> 41:00.146
But when you ready, we got some
real work for ya, a-ight?

41:14.973 --> 41:15.557
Jesus.

41:32.133 --> 41:34.543
Hey, how you doing?

41:36.965 --> 41:37.346
Okay.

41:47.684 --> 41:49.229
We were just talking about you.

41:49.556 --> 41:50.172
Really?

41:50.318 --> 41:51.731
You know Denise
from the sorority.

41:52.146 --> 41:53.210
Charles of course.

41:53.345 --> 41:55.493
- Always a pleasure Lieutenant.
- Good to see you.

41:55.589 --> 41:58.561
And I don't think you've
ever met Delegate Watkins.

41:58.897 --> 42:01.119
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

42:01.387 --> 42:03.790
We were saying you fill out
a lieutenant's uniform nicely.

42:04.440 --> 42:06.189
Makes an impression
on the campaign lit.

42:06.715 --> 42:07.569
That matters?

42:08.601 --> 42:11.685
Marla's a new face taking
on a longtime incumbent.

42:11.752 --> 42:13.165
Everything matters, I'm afraid.

42:13.188 --> 42:14.668
Well, anything
I can do to help.

42:15.442 --> 42:15.991
I'll, um...

42:16.810 --> 42:18.706
get out of the way
and leave you all to it.

42:23.550 --> 42:26.117
Marla, I have to tell you
that your photo with Cedric

42:26.151 --> 42:27.789
works really well
on the mailing.

42:28.114 --> 42:28.573
<i>Yeah. </i>

42:29.862 --> 42:32.058
<i>I sure hope he knows
what he's in for</i>

42:32.092 --> 42:34.828
<i>because it's going to be
a long race for the both of you. </i>

42:36.481 --> 42:38.599
<i>speaking of which,
you've got to make some... </i>

42:46.634 --> 42:49.000
Jesus, who called the media?

43:03.777 --> 43:05.392
<i>Naw, you think
the man might respect</i>

43:05.414 --> 43:06.873
<i>my shit enough
to let me step up,</i>

43:06.895 --> 43:08.264
<i>but it ain't
even go like that. </i>

43:08.487 --> 43:09.238
<i>Why not?</i>

43:09.396 --> 43:12.311
<i>He gonna give Lavell's corners
to that off-brand nigga Cheese. </i>

43:12.350 --> 43:14.389
<i>An' you know what?
Joe my uncle an' shit. </i>

43:14.825 --> 43:16.866
<i>I mean, I'm kin to
the fat motherfucker. </i>

43:17.282 --> 43:20.377
That idiot worked for us he'd
be a deputy commissioner by now.

43:22.246 --> 43:24.119
Ain't no luck
at all to this case.

43:26.687 --> 43:29.030
And how in all good
conscience can I,

43:29.131 --> 43:30.601
as chairman
of this subcommittee,

43:30.646 --> 43:32.642
authorize anymore above-the-line
overtime.

43:32.698 --> 43:34.907
When it's clear enough
from the data in front of me

43:34.941 --> 43:37.104
that that money is not going
to go to line officers

43:37.138 --> 43:38.092
or working detectives.

43:38.104 --> 43:40.705
But is being to be paying
for drivers and clerical

43:40.728 --> 43:41.850
and Jesus look at this.

43:41.872 --> 43:44.901
So that two colonels
and three majors can attend

43:44.912 --> 43:47.265
a community policing
seminar in Miami, Florida?

43:47.344 --> 43:48.589
Mr. Chairman.

43:48.769 --> 43:51.011
What does South Beach
have to teach this department

43:51.022 --> 43:53.232
about making Baltimore
a safer place, Commissioner?

43:53.243 --> 43:54.433
I have no idea

43:54.555 --> 43:57.114
and you have no idea
and it is an embarrassment.

44:00.392 --> 44:00.986
<i>Cedric?</i>

44:01.939 --> 44:02.713
<i>They're gone. </i>

44:14.724 --> 44:16.158
I want to thank you for this.

44:16.820 --> 44:17.975
No problem.

44:19.006 --> 44:20.273
It's not easy, I know.

44:20.438 --> 44:22.020
But they seem
to think it matters

44:22.042 --> 44:23.354
that I present myself as...

44:23.825 --> 44:24.623
I'm fine with it.

44:26.743 --> 44:28.761
All those years you were
all about my career,

44:30.680 --> 44:32.371
Well, it's the least
I can do, right?

44:36.777 --> 44:37.294
Goodnight.

44:44.741 --> 44:46.790
<i>We're not holding
anything up in his district. </i>

44:46.809 --> 44:49.921
<i>Repaving, foot patrols,
streetlights. </i>

44:50.837 --> 44:51.992
<i>He's getting his share. </i>

44:53.832 --> 44:56.400
<i>Unless, it's not
about his district. </i>

44:58.149 --> 44:58.946
<i>It's about him. </i>

45:00.829 --> 45:02.642
<i>Maybe he's got
big eyes for something. </i>

45:03.932 --> 45:04.470
For what?

45:05.793 --> 45:08.787
Not me, not my chair.
Not in this town.

45:09.617 --> 45:10.011
Oh, no.

45:10.044 --> 45:12.410
If the man came off any whiter,
he'd be see-through.

45:13.071 --> 45:14.596
But, if that's it,
come on with it.

45:14.675 --> 45:16.445
In fact, please Jesus.

45:16.446 --> 45:18.140
<i>Or maybe John the Baptist. </i>

45:18.725 --> 45:20.229
Soften you up
for someone else.

45:20.610 --> 45:22.369
If he's gonna
bang us on crime.

45:22.413 --> 45:23.435
Bang me on crime.

45:24.925 --> 45:27.202
Look, is there any way
for you to talk to this guy?

45:27.729 --> 45:29.417
Keep him from
crawling up my ass?

45:29.450 --> 45:30.863
He's old first district.

45:31.693 --> 45:34.190
Not a lot of favors we can call
in over that side of town.

45:34.196 --> 45:36.034
So, we gotta show
him something, right?

45:36.057 --> 45:38.860
Four to five percent
drop in felonies.

45:39.061 --> 45:39.752
And murders.

45:40.662 --> 45:43.856
Get the murders down
to under 250 for the year.

45:44.597 --> 45:47.705
All due respect,
Mr. Mayor, we're at 232 now.

45:48.714 --> 45:50.206
What can you
realistically do?

45:50.710 --> 45:53.291
Best case scenario,
if we bump the overtime

45:53.538 --> 45:55.914
is 275 maybe.

45:56.206 --> 45:58.180
275, Christ.

45:58.650 --> 45:59.852
That's a promise, right?

46:01.097 --> 46:05.817
275 and this asshole
Carcetti has no issue.

46:22.858 --> 46:24.921
Gentlemen,
the word from on high

46:24.933 --> 46:27.355
is that felony rates
district by district

46:27.714 --> 46:31.134
will decline by five percent
before the end of the year.

46:31.214 --> 46:32.571
We are dealing in certainties.

46:32.594 --> 46:34.623
You will reduce
the U.C.R. felonies

46:34.635 --> 46:36.418
by five percent or more, or...

46:37.270 --> 46:38.898
I've always wanted
to say this...

46:39.648 --> 46:41.230
let no man come back alive.

46:41.523 --> 46:46.023
In addition, we will hold this
year's murders to 275 or less.

46:46.045 --> 46:46.494
Christ.

46:47.985 --> 46:49.814
Feeling a little fazed,
Colonel Foerster?

46:50.969 --> 46:52.068
A little dyspeptic?

46:52.672 --> 46:53.259
Dis-who?

46:53.799 --> 46:54.315
No, Sir.

46:55.402 --> 46:56.154
I'm good to go.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.224
He's a fun fact
for you people:

47:00.964 --> 47:02.639
If Baltimore had
New York's population,

47:02.662 --> 47:04.911
we'd be clocking 4000 murders
a year at this rate.

47:05.236 --> 47:06.919
There is no excuse
I will except.

47:07.380 --> 47:08.513
I don't care how you do it,

47:09.208 --> 47:10.105
just fucking do it.

47:11.703 --> 47:12.562
Deputy, as familiar

47:12.563 --> 47:15.136
as we all are with the urban
crime environment,

47:15.697 --> 47:19.341
I think we all understand
there's certain processes,

47:19.830 --> 47:22.301
by which you can reduce
the number of overall felonies.

47:22.343 --> 47:24.597
You can re-classify
an agg assault

47:24.598 --> 47:26.380
or you can
unfound a robbery.

47:26.436 --> 47:29.150
But, how do you
make a body disappear?

47:31.842 --> 47:33.514
There is not
one of you in this room

47:33.525 --> 47:35.017
who isn't here
by appointment.

47:35.958 --> 47:39.256
If you want to continue
wearing those oak clusters,

47:39.716 --> 47:42.141
you will shut up
and step up.

47:42.232 --> 47:44.384
Any of you who can't bring
the numbers we need

47:44.406 --> 47:46.795
will be replaced
by someone who can.

47:50.093 --> 47:50.810
That is all.

47:53.019 --> 47:53.894
Jesus, Bunny.

47:54.813 --> 47:56.148
What got into you?

47:56.967 --> 47:58.390
I got six months to my 30,

47:58.391 --> 48:00.129
I'm out the door
on a major's pension.

48:00.656 --> 48:01.925
The hell can they do to me?

48:06.777 --> 48:08.346
<i>Spider bags, red tops. </i>

48:37.603 --> 48:39.026
Any other bright ideas?

48:39.216 --> 48:40.871
- How about a bug?
- A bug?

48:41.858 --> 48:44.742
Yeah, bug one or two of the big
corners where these mopes hang.

48:44.988 --> 48:47.165
Watchin' those corners
over on Ashland yesterday,

48:47.187 --> 48:50.371
I'm seeing dumpsters,
weeds, maybe utility poles.

48:50.972 --> 48:52.486
You hide a bug
on the right corner

48:52.497 --> 48:54.178
at the right moment
you make this case.

48:54.201 --> 48:56.623
We don't have the manpower.
Not to mention the money.

48:57.251 --> 48:58.035
And for what?

48:58.192 --> 49:00.380
We're still a long way
from a quality target.

49:00.481 --> 49:03.608
I say we come down off the wire,
charge what we can and move on.

49:04.012 --> 49:05.750
We come down early
two years ago

49:05.772 --> 49:07.589
and we left a real bastard
on the street.

49:07.623 --> 49:09.147
You're telling me
we're gonna let

49:09.148 --> 49:10.808
that same sonofabitch
beat me again?

49:11.022 --> 49:12.676
How many times
do you let a cocksucker

49:12.698 --> 49:14.370
like Stringer Bell
go 'round the board?

49:14.381 --> 49:16.060
Collect another
fuckin' 200 million.

49:17.645 --> 49:19.521
There's other fish
in the barrel, McNulty.

49:19.544 --> 49:20.992
Stringer's the target.

49:21.252 --> 49:23.095
There isn't a better
motherfucker out there,

49:23.107 --> 49:24.167
you know it, Lieutenant.

49:29.824 --> 49:31.496
Don't you let him
go soft on this.

49:32.819 --> 49:34.478
It's you against
the world, is it?

49:40.787 --> 49:41.875
What the fuck did I do?

49:44.016 --> 49:45.250
<i>Red tops! Spider bags!</i>

49:45.922 --> 49:46.426
You up?

49:58.481 --> 49:59.849
Step the fuck off,
motherfucker.

50:01.385 --> 50:03.459
You got a need you
talk to one of the younguns.

50:03.886 --> 50:05.826
I ain't in the market.
I'm sellin'.

50:06.846 --> 50:09.370
You look like the right person
to be talkin' to, chief.

50:09.740 --> 50:11.984
You seem like you steady
runnin' this shit here.

50:13.037 --> 50:15.056
What, you some kind
of police or somethin'?

50:15.415 --> 50:17.759
I'm a long motherfuckin'
way from the police.

50:17.983 --> 50:20.450
I just finished
a 14 year bit in Jessup.

50:20.922 --> 50:23.849
Got a package as
a comin' home present.

50:24.297 --> 50:25.015
G- pack.

50:25.677 --> 50:27.400
Why not sell that shit
your own self?

50:27.684 --> 50:29.053
I just came home.

50:29.198 --> 50:30.995
I ain't tryin' to get
my ass violated.

50:33.449 --> 50:35.053
- Even split.
- Sheet.

50:35.694 --> 50:37.028
It's all profit to you.

50:37.354 --> 50:38.497
Risk mine, too.

50:39.003 --> 50:41.403
What make you think
I ain't on paper or someshit?

50:41.695 --> 50:42.457
60/40.

50:47.942 --> 50:48.413
Cool.

50:49.578 --> 50:50.934
Give your shit to my boy.

50:52.112 --> 50:53.863
He good with it,
then come past tonight.

50:54.142 --> 50:54.546
A'ight.

50:57.778 --> 50:59.359
<i>And one last item
for you gents. </i>

50:59.818 --> 51:02.195
It seems foxtrot was hovering
over the station house

51:02.206 --> 51:04.101
a few days ago
and caught a lovely view

51:04.123 --> 51:07.463
of about seven or 800 discarded
beer cans on the garage roof.

51:08.260 --> 51:11.265
<i>Seriously, no off-duty
drinking on the station lot</i>

51:11.434 --> 51:13.789
and if you do find
yourself holding a beer can

51:13.800 --> 51:15.976
don't throw it on the roof,
take it home with you.

51:17.557 --> 51:19.251
Come on, guys,
the memo came down

51:19.263 --> 51:21.146
from our beloved Deputy
of Operations.

51:22.760 --> 51:24.678
Alright, get outta here.

51:25.968 --> 51:27.056
<i>Don't get captured. </i>

51:32.170 --> 51:32.836
At ease.

51:35.854 --> 51:36.998
Anything from day shift?

51:37.367 --> 51:38.792
Nothing that'll make the papers.

51:39.128 --> 51:40.945
Alright then.
I'm gonna ride the district

51:40.967 --> 51:42.403
until the Deputy Major gets in.

51:42.470 --> 51:43.739
If you need me, hit the radio.

51:47.013 --> 51:47.877
Distribution?

51:49.873 --> 51:50.659
Possession,

51:51.702 --> 51:52.656
and some loitering.

51:53.362 --> 51:54.051
Loitering?

51:54.869 --> 51:55.966
And behaving like assles

51:55.967 --> 51:57.952
in the presence
of sworn officers, boss.

53:10.903 --> 53:12.260
5-0 creepin'!

53:25.600 --> 53:27.632
Midnight relief comin' in.

53:55.425 --> 53:56.805
The hell is all this?

53:59.272 --> 54:00.921
You don't look at
what you did before,

54:00.954 --> 54:02.255
you do the same shit
all over.

54:03.855 --> 54:04.865
I'm outta here.

54:58.363 --> 54:59.060
Where he at?

55:22.939 --> 55:23.981
The fuck you lookin' at?

55:25.844 --> 55:26.192
Huh?

55:28.164 --> 55:29.209
What, you want a go?

55:29.680 --> 55:30.600
Just my split.

55:32.192 --> 55:33.493
Some bad luck there.

55:34.526 --> 55:37.968
Poh-leece came through snatched
up a grod stash or two.

55:38.170 --> 55:39.673
Shit happened to be yours.

55:40.502 --> 55:41.231
Fuck, right?

55:42.364 --> 55:43.363
You got a number?

55:43.878 --> 55:44.426
A number?

55:45.222 --> 55:47.075
Back in the day,
when a player tried to say

55:47.097 --> 55:48.800
he lost a package
to the police,

55:49.249 --> 55:51.301
he had to give up
a number for the report.

55:52.399 --> 55:53.733
We ain't back in the day.

55:55.460 --> 55:57.693
I'm gettin' fuckin'
tired of your ass.

56:09.848 --> 56:11.588
Yeah, walk it off,
motherfucker.

56:13.576 --> 56:15.359
Fuckin' old school ass bitch.

56:35.549 --> 56:36.738
Got them spider bags.

56:37.210 --> 56:38.331
Two get you three.

56:38.365 --> 56:38.914
What?

56:39.486 --> 56:40.204
You up?

56:40.866 --> 56:41.663
Spider bags.

56:41.921 --> 56:42.863
Two gets three.

56:44.948 --> 56:46.651
You up or you not?

56:57.376 --> 56:58.610
<i>Don't you know five-o?</i>

56:59.305 --> 57:05.459
