00:06.115 --> 00:08.200
This is not funny.

00:08.202 --> 00:11.920
<i>(laughing): Someone got you
a subscription to Older Bride?</i>

00:11.922 --> 00:13.594
I think that qualifies as very funny.

00:13.595 --> 00:18.227
- "17 Reasons Not To Give Up the Hunt." Ooh.
- Ha, ha, ha.

00:18.229 --> 00:20.345
We all know that my singleness is a choice.

00:20.347 --> 00:22.481
- Oh, you go, sistah.
- So, clearly this was you two?

00:22.483 --> 00:25.050
Syd, look, you know if I came
up with a prank this brilliant,

00:25.052 --> 00:27.069
I would be the first person to take credit for it.

00:27.071 --> 00:29.141
- How is this brilliant?
- First of all, it's ridiculous,

00:29.143 --> 00:30.726
but with that little kernel of truth

00:30.728 --> 00:32.478
that evokes our deepest fears... in this case,

00:32.479 --> 00:33.762
dying alone and unloved.

00:33.764 --> 00:35.197
(Zach giggles)

00:35.199 --> 00:39.434
But it's also very mean,
and whoever did it is bad.

00:39.436 --> 00:40.702
Are we expecting somebody?

00:40.704 --> 00:43.372
Simon said something about a royal arrival.

00:44.290 --> 00:48.460
Princess is our most distinguished visitor.

00:48.462 --> 00:51.830
During her visit, I expect... nay,

00:51.832 --> 00:56.502
I require... you to be on your best behavior.

00:56.504 --> 00:58.720
Is that his Dame Judy or Dame Edna?

00:58.722 --> 01:01.122
<i>So do not get too close.</i>

01:01.124 --> 01:03.425
Do not make eye contact.

01:03.427 --> 01:07.980
And under no circumstance
may you stroke the Princess.

01:07.982 --> 01:09.932
I'd assume that goes for all royalty.

01:09.934 --> 01:11.299
Or anyone, really.

01:11.301 --> 01:13.902
- (elevator bell dings)
- She's here. Oh.

01:16.055 --> 01:17.506
English cat.

01:17.508 --> 01:18.991
(employees groan)

01:18.993 --> 01:21.309
What? If I said it was just a
cat, nobody would've showed up.

01:21.311 --> 01:23.078
Come on.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.981
Simon Roberts, you sexy devil.

01:25.983 --> 01:29.001
Judy, get over here. Give me a hug.

01:29.003 --> 01:31.703
Sydney, this is Judy Mills
of Regal Kitty cat food.

01:31.705 --> 01:36.625
Wow, look at this place. Oh,
Princess is going to love it here.

01:36.627 --> 01:37.659
We're getting an office pet?

01:37.661 --> 01:39.764
- Just for a few days.
- To help your team get a...

01:39.770 --> 01:43.015
"feline" for our customer experience.

01:43.017 --> 01:44.633
I see what you did there, it's clever.

01:44.635 --> 01:46.051
We're gonna make her feel right at home.

01:46.053 --> 01:49.137
We put bowls of cat treats all around the office.

01:49.139 --> 01:50.767
Well, I can't wait to hear the pitch

01:50.768 --> 01:53.341
- you're cooking up for Wednesday.
- Prepare to be wowed.

01:53.343 --> 01:54.610
Or shall I say (meows).

01:54.662 --> 01:57.329
This guy gets it.

01:57.331 --> 02:00.031
Oh, and I was very excited
to hear about your agency's

02:00.033 --> 02:02.701
new emphasis on hard numbers and data.

02:02.703 --> 02:03.886
Excuse me?

02:03.888 --> 02:05.387
Yeah, I heard you hired a quant.

02:05.389 --> 02:06.638
Ah. A what?

02:06.640 --> 02:07.756
The question is not what

02:07.758 --> 02:11.393
is a quant, but rather, who is the quant?

02:11.395 --> 02:13.095
And the answer to that... is I.

02:13.097 --> 02:15.264
- You what?
- Am the quant. I'm the quant.

02:15.266 --> 02:16.899
You don't know your own quant?

02:16.901 --> 02:18.300
Quant's the main reason we're here.

02:18.302 --> 02:20.018
Oh, no, no, he loves the
quant and, more importantly,

02:20.020 --> 02:21.770
he loves that you love the quant. Right, Dad?

02:21.772 --> 02:23.739
Oh, the heart quants what the heart quants.

02:23.741 --> 02:26.892
Come here, you little quant. (laughs)

02:26.894 --> 02:28.077

02:45.096 --> 02:47.596
Colin is our new senior quantitative analyst.

02:47.598 --> 02:49.648
Hence my abbreviated moniker, Quant.

02:49.650 --> 02:51.417
Hmm. You knew we hired him.

02:51.419 --> 02:52.935
Really big argument with Gordon, remember?

02:52.937 --> 02:54.386
And then, ultimately, we outvoted you.

02:54.388 --> 02:56.805
Really? I guess I just
blocked it out for some reason.

02:56.807 --> 02:59.892
I use deep data combined
with proprietary algorithms

02:59.894 --> 03:03.228
in order to microtarget customers
and increase market share.

03:03.230 --> 03:05.397
I just realized why I blocked it
out. Look, all the big agencies

03:05.399 --> 03:07.232
are using these whiz kids. I mean,

03:07.234 --> 03:08.953
Colin is the best at what he does. He's a genius.

03:08.954 --> 03:10.764
Genius. I hate it when
people throw that word around.

03:10.775 --> 03:11.987
What makes you a genius?

03:11.989 --> 03:13.438
Nine different standardized tests

03:13.440 --> 03:15.858
and the MacArthur Genius
Grant that I was awarded at 16.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.493
It was a rhetorical question, Mr. Mensa.

03:17.495 --> 03:19.745
Dad, the cat people really
want him on the account.

03:19.747 --> 03:21.830
It's one of the only reasons
they're even considering us.

03:21.832 --> 03:23.799
You know, give him a chance, you might like him.

03:23.801 --> 03:25.801
Who knows? By next week, you might be asking

03:25.803 --> 03:27.419
to join my Quidditch team.

03:27.421 --> 03:28.754
"Like" might be a strong word.

03:28.756 --> 03:30.889
You know, let's aim for "tolerate."

03:30.891 --> 03:32.174
Yeah.

03:32.176 --> 03:34.106
Hey, Syd, have you seen Princess?

03:34.612 --> 03:36.962
I saved some of the cat treats
before Andrew could get to them.

03:36.964 --> 03:39.231
You know, he's really
developing a taste for these.

03:39.983 --> 03:41.183
Soon as they put her down,

03:41.185 --> 03:42.784
- she just made herself at home.
- Oh.

03:42.786 --> 03:45.136
You know Princess is a he, right?

03:45.138 --> 03:47.639
- How can you tell?
- He's got little cat balls.

03:47.641 --> 03:48.510
(purring) You can see 'em.

03:48.610 --> 03:50.809
The cat penis you can't see, you know,

03:50.811 --> 03:51.944
(whispers): till it's too late.

03:51.946 --> 03:54.012
That's very educational, Lauren.

03:54.014 --> 03:55.998
You... maybe you could take
Mr. Princess somewhere else?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.315
Aw...

03:57.317 --> 04:01.203
- How could you resist this little fur-ball?
- (meows)

04:01.205 --> 04:02.204
Hi, big guy.

04:02.206 --> 04:04.289
I'm not much of a cat person.

04:04.291 --> 04:08.159
You know, you look into a dog's
eyes, and you can see its soul, and

04:08.161 --> 04:10.328
you look into a cat's eyes, and you see a soul

04:10.330 --> 04:12.014
thants wto kill you in your sleep.

04:12.016 --> 04:13.832
But there would be no cuter way to go.

04:13.834 --> 04:16.084
- (loud purring)
- Do you want to rip my throat out?

04:16.086 --> 04:17.435
Yes, you do.

04:17.438 --> 04:19.738
Yes, you do. Oh.

04:19.740 --> 04:21.305
(speaks quietly) I appreciate it, Lauren.

04:21.308 --> 04:23.892
- Good-bye.
- I'm not even on Regal Kitty.

04:23.894 --> 04:25.077
I've got Maytag this week.

04:25.079 --> 04:27.396
(mewing)

04:27.398 --> 04:30.515
Oh, let him in. It's cold outside.

04:30.517 --> 04:32.134
You know that's still inside, right?

04:32.136 --> 04:33.902
(meowing)

04:33.904 --> 04:36.538
(sighs) Fine, you can let him in for a bit.

04:36.540 --> 04:39.241
- Oh.
- (mewing)

04:39.243 --> 04:42.327
Good boy. Oh, you good boy.

04:42.329 --> 04:45.330
If I died alone in my
house, would you eat my face?

04:45.332 --> 04:47.532
Yes, you would. That's
where the tenderest meat is.

04:47.534 --> 04:49.718
- (mews)
- Ah.

04:49.720 --> 04:50.702
I love this direction.

04:50.703 --> 04:52.367
We see the cat owner leaving for work.

04:52.368 --> 04:54.346
- And then we see the cat leaving for work.
- Uh-huh.

04:54.347 --> 04:56.642
He goes to a cat office, just like a human office.

04:56.644 --> 04:58.527
- Except all the cats are wearing little shirts and ties.
- Adorable.

04:58.529 --> 04:59.978
And they don't work. They
just surf the Internet all day.

04:59.980 --> 05:01.665
- Just like humans do.
- They're on Facebook.

05:01.666 --> 05:02.921
- Myspace?
- Not anymore.

05:02.922 --> 05:03.822
- Friendster.
- Way gone.

05:03.851 --> 05:04.933
Porn... that's still a thing, right?

05:04.935 --> 05:06.818
Yeah, yeah. It's going strong. Oh.

05:06.820 --> 05:08.270
- BOTH: YouTube. Yes!
- Yeah.

05:08.272 --> 05:09.571
Instead of watching cat videos,

05:09.573 --> 05:10.889
the cats are watching human videos.

05:10.906 --> 05:12.156
Right, so he's got his arms

05:12.158 --> 05:13.524
all straight out playing a keyboard.

05:13.526 --> 05:15.943
We got a guy doing that, just like the cat, right?

05:15.945 --> 05:18.395
We see a lady peeking out from a grocery bag.

05:18.397 --> 05:19.413
(knocking) Regal Kitty:

05:19.415 --> 05:20.531
Your cat is basically a person.

05:20.533 --> 05:21.782
Feed them like one.

05:21.784 --> 05:24.284
I have the best team of creatives in the country.

05:24.286 --> 05:25.819
(meowing)

05:25.821 --> 05:27.988
- That's a fantastic idea.
- COLIN: The data

05:27.990 --> 05:29.155
shows otherwise.

05:29.157 --> 05:31.458
- (hissing)
- Do you think this will turn him off?

05:31.460 --> 05:32.709
Yeah, try TV/Video or something.

05:32.711 --> 05:34.995
- Yeah, maybe that will work.
- With all due respect,

05:34.997 --> 05:37.497
there's no guarantee that humor can sell cat food.

05:37.499 --> 05:38.632
No, there isn't.

05:38.634 --> 05:40.767
Because advertising is an art, not a science.

05:40.769 --> 05:42.002
It was an art.

05:42.004 --> 05:44.170
But quants like me are turning it into a science.

05:44.172 --> 05:45.906
Take a look at these graphs.

05:45.908 --> 05:47.808
(thuds)

05:47.810 --> 05:49.493
That research clearly states

05:49.495 --> 05:51.195
that we should focus on the easy-open can.

05:51.197 --> 05:52.863
So the commercial should be
two people standing around

05:52.865 --> 05:54.180
talking about an easy-open can?

05:54.182 --> 05:55.315
That was good. Did you get that down?

05:55.317 --> 05:56.500
No, don't get that down; it wasn't good.

05:56.502 --> 05:58.351
It's annoying and obvious.

05:58.353 --> 05:59.987
There's enough visual pollution in the world.

05:59.989 --> 06:01.738
(sighs)

06:01.740 --> 06:03.874
There's a billboard on Belmont Avenue

06:03.876 --> 06:05.726
I did for the Adler Planetarium.

06:05.728 --> 06:07.244
The one with the silhouettes of the kids' faces?

06:07.246 --> 06:09.713
Yeah, where real stars shine
through at night. It's a classic.

06:09.780 --> 06:11.563
SIMON: "Get a Head Full of Stars."

06:11.565 --> 06:13.615
(chuckles) I never would've found it

06:13.617 --> 06:15.433
if I had listened to the research.

06:15.435 --> 06:17.736
They wanted me to focus on the reclining seats.

06:17.738 --> 06:19.404
On our best days,

06:19.406 --> 06:20.906
I want to inspire.

06:20.908 --> 06:23.441
I want to be able to walk down the street,

06:23.443 --> 06:25.544
look up at my billboard and be proud to say,

06:25.546 --> 06:28.330
"Simon Roberts Was Here."

06:28.332 --> 06:31.433
(sighs) Look, Simon, you're the boss,

06:31.435 --> 06:33.485
and if you choose to neglect my data,

06:33.487 --> 06:34.886
well, that's your decision.

06:34.888 --> 06:36.121
No, it's obvious that you disagree.

06:36.123 --> 06:37.806
So speak freely as if you're in a chat room

06:37.808 --> 06:39.174
full of antisocial virgins.

06:39.176 --> 06:42.394
Fine, your creative ads may start conversations,

06:42.396 --> 06:44.179
but I contend my computer generated ads

06:44.181 --> 06:45.981
are more persuasive any day.

06:45.983 --> 06:47.482
Oh, really?

06:47.484 --> 06:49.985
But like I said, we'll do it your way.

06:49.987 --> 06:51.737
No, no, no, please. I don't
want to win by pulling rank.

06:51.739 --> 06:53.071
I'm want to win by being better than you,

06:53.073 --> 06:54.639
then shoving that fact in your face.

06:54.641 --> 06:56.325
How about a bet?

06:56.327 --> 06:58.343
- What's the wager?
- $50,000.

06:58.345 --> 07:00.579
Let's let the people making
the bet decide the stakes.

07:00.581 --> 07:01.663
- Sorry.
- The winner gets

07:01.665 --> 07:04.066
to pitch his ad to Regal Kitty cat foods.

07:04.068 --> 07:06.618
Competition will be a print ad for...

07:08.254 --> 07:10.321
- ice.
- Who's gonna judge?

07:10.323 --> 07:12.507
I'm fine with Zach, Andrew and Sydney.

07:12.509 --> 07:13.842
That's unfair, I know everything about them.

07:13.844 --> 07:15.093
Hell, Sydney's like a daughter to me.

07:15.095 --> 07:17.495
That's how confident I am.

Older Bride magazine on it?

08:06.897 --> 08:08.063
Huh, yeah, came with the subscription.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.271
It's actually very functional.

08:09.273 --> 08:10.989
I'm keeping cat treats in it,

08:10.991 --> 08:13.575
so thank you to whoever signed me up for that.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.577
You are not going to trick
us into admitting it was us.

08:15.579 --> 08:16.811
I know it was you.

08:16.813 --> 08:18.780
Do you have any of the peanut
butter mice-shaped ones?

08:18.782 --> 08:19.981
Oh, my God.

08:19.983 --> 08:21.116
What? I read the box.

08:21.118 --> 08:22.701
It says human grade, you elitist.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.369
LAUREN: All right, everybody.

08:24.371 --> 08:27.655
Let the judging begin.

08:27.657 --> 08:29.357
Whoa, they're both good.

08:29.359 --> 08:30.342
SYDNEY: Really good.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.526
ANDREW: They both make me want ice.

08:31.528 --> 08:33.010
But one ad is more persuasive.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.379
- Clearly. Right.
- Yeah.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.715
- And, uh, which one is that?
- Mm-hmm.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:49.445 --> 08:52.480
The better ad is Simon's ad.

08:52.482 --> 08:53.315
(chuckles)

08:53.317 --> 08:54.482
Yeah.

08:54.484 --> 08:56.902
Mm-hmm, which is "Savor the Moment."

08:56.904 --> 08:57.903
SYDNEY: That's the best one.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.154
ANDREW: So obviously his work.

08:59.156 --> 08:59.921
(strained chuckle)

08:59.923 --> 09:01.656
- Opposite day!
- Lies!

09:01.658 --> 09:03.458
- Through my teeth!
- "Nice" is nicer!

09:03.460 --> 09:04.376
- What we like...
- I like that one.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.094
- Is the "Nice."
- I like that one.

09:06.096 --> 09:07.579
Too late. In your face, humans.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.331
Yes. Ooh.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.968
Congratulations, Colin.

09:20.119 --> 09:21.553
Okay, fine.

09:21.555 --> 09:23.955
I'll go to freaking Lake
Tahoe for her stupid wedding,

09:23.957 --> 09:25.590
but then she expects me to dress up

09:25.592 --> 09:27.859
in this purple Grape Ape dress

09:27.861 --> 09:29.427
to be one of her six bridesmaids.

09:29.429 --> 09:30.428
Six bridesmaids?

09:30.430 --> 09:31.763
How do you have six friends?

09:31.765 --> 09:34.232
I only have two, and only like one of them.

09:34.234 --> 09:38.186
- (purring)
- She said to the cat like he's a person.

09:38.188 --> 09:39.988
Okay, Sydney,

09:39.990 --> 09:42.273
- you're going to be late to the Maytag meeting.
- (meows)

09:45.111 --> 09:47.329
Oh, I forgot my Maytag file.

09:47.331 --> 09:49.114
Did you just...

09:49.116 --> 09:50.865
remind me?

09:50.867 --> 09:52.117
Oh, and my lip gloss.

09:52.119 --> 09:54.319
(growling meow)

09:55.204 --> 09:56.705
Less is more.

09:56.707 --> 09:58.072
Got it.

09:58.074 --> 10:00.709
Cat.

10:05.364 --> 10:07.215
(elevator bell dings)

10:07.217 --> 10:08.850
I feel awful.

10:08.852 --> 10:11.269
I just hope Simon's not taking his loss too hard.

10:11.271 --> 10:13.338
Hey, Number Three, Number 14.
I've given everyone numbers

10:13.340 --> 10:15.023
so I can quantify their values.

10:15.025 --> 10:16.608
I'm One, Sydney's Two, Zach's Three.

10:16.610 --> 10:18.610
- And I'm 14.
- Don't read into it. Hey, Six.

10:18.612 --> 10:19.978
I get that.

10:19.980 --> 10:21.796
Water's the most important meal of the day.

10:21.798 --> 10:23.264
- Simon, you okay?
- Never been better.

10:23.266 --> 10:25.233
I'm embracing this brave new world.

10:25.235 --> 10:26.351
Hey, uh, Simon,

10:26.353 --> 10:29.487
your lightbulb's been replaced
with a math-type thingy.

10:29.489 --> 10:30.772
Math-type thingies are the wave of the future.

10:30.774 --> 10:32.624
- Creativity is on its way out. Follow me.
- Huh.

10:32.626 --> 10:35.076
I'm not sure I like Numbers Simon.

10:35.078 --> 10:36.544
Ah, shut it, Number Three.

10:36.546 --> 10:37.962
It's beautiful, isn't it?

10:37.964 --> 10:39.441
- Rockwellesque.
- ANDREW: Mmm, yeah.

10:39.448 --> 10:40.980
You know, I'm getting a subtle denial vibe

10:40.982 --> 10:42.115
from that general direction.

10:42.117 --> 10:43.116
I am not in denial.

10:43.118 --> 10:44.417
And I'm not upset.

10:44.419 --> 10:45.919
You don't see me playing my sad bagpipes, do you?

10:45.921 --> 10:47.487
What... Dad, I just got a memo.

10:47.489 --> 10:49.089
Did you promote the copier machine

10:49.091 --> 10:50.290
- to Head of Communications?
- SIMON: Yes.

10:50.292 --> 10:51.925
It's very efficient, doesn't take breaks,

10:51.927 --> 10:53.576
and doesn't complain when
I sit on it with no pants.

10:53.578 --> 10:54.678
In my defense,

10:54.680 --> 10:57.180
- you're heavier than you look.
- Really?

10:57.182 --> 10:58.465
Dad, I think you're taking
this a little far, okay?

10:58.467 --> 10:59.666
I just wanted you to be open

10:59.668 --> 11:00.667
to what Colin had to say.

11:00.669 --> 11:01.768
I don't want you to stop being you.

11:01.770 --> 11:03.186
Colin's ad was clearly better.

11:03.188 --> 11:04.170
You guys chose it yourselves.

11:04.172 --> 11:05.388
Look, the kid got lucky.

11:05.390 --> 11:06.523
No, he got quant-y.

11:06.525 --> 11:08.391
He targeted each of you with specific triggers.

11:08.393 --> 11:10.060
But I used his own technology against him.

11:10.062 --> 11:12.445
I downloaded this print out from his computer.

11:12.447 --> 11:13.846
Actually, Dale in IT pressed the buttons

11:13.848 --> 11:15.482
so there's plausible deniability.

11:15.484 --> 11:18.585
What I'm saying is the quant
created a profile for each of you

11:18.587 --> 11:20.236
based on your personal Web histories.

11:20.238 --> 11:22.122
E... even sites that we visited

11:22.124 --> 11:23.323
in "private browsing" mode?

11:23.325 --> 11:25.875
Yes, Mr. "I visited the Goop Web
site" eight times in one day."

11:25.877 --> 11:27.694
Isn't that Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle blog?

11:27.696 --> 11:30.080
I... I find it useful to
know what women are thinking,

11:30.082 --> 11:31.531
to get inside their minds.

11:31.533 --> 11:33.667
Also, her avocado hair mask
recipe is out of this world.

11:33.669 --> 11:35.752
Hold on. You're saying that
he used this information

11:35.754 --> 11:38.104
to trick us into picking his ad? How?

11:38.106 --> 11:39.639
Let me show you.

11:39.641 --> 11:41.424
Notice the melting ice sculpture.

11:41.426 --> 11:43.426
So what? It's just a swan.

11:43.428 --> 11:45.929
But if I do this...

11:45.931 --> 11:47.147
The Millennium Falcon.

11:47.149 --> 11:48.031
It's a trap.

11:48.088 --> 11:49.220
Yesterday you posted a file on

11:49.222 --> 11:50.722
<i>the Star Wars fan fic Web site</i>

11:50.724 --> 11:53.508
entitled "The Continuing
Adventures of Andrew Skywalker".

11:53.510 --> 11:55.677
A lesser-known but pivotal character

11:55.679 --> 11:57.345
<i>in the Star Wars pantheon.</i>

11:57.347 --> 11:59.030
And, Zach, you Googled yourself

11:59.032 --> 12:00.699
20 times in three days.

12:00.701 --> 12:01.900
What do you notice

12:01.902 --> 12:03.351
about this couple?

12:03.353 --> 12:06.371
They both kind of look like me. Bingo.

12:06.373 --> 12:08.690
I... I knew that there was a reason I liked them.

12:08.692 --> 12:09.607
And, Sydney...

12:09.609 --> 12:10.959
notice the woman is wearing

12:10.961 --> 12:12.610
a wedding ring on her left hand?

12:12.612 --> 12:14.412
That's because on the night of the 17th,

12:14.414 --> 12:16.998
<i>you went online and subscribed
to Older Bride magazine.</i>

12:17.000 --> 12:18.166
(gasps)

12:19.368 --> 12:20.868
The... the night of the 17th was the night

12:20.870 --> 12:22.170
that we all stayed late for Stacy's bachelorette.

12:22.172 --> 12:23.972
I... I got drunk and I called her a lucky bitch

12:23.974 --> 12:25.340
and then I just shortened it to bitch.

12:25.342 --> 12:26.591
And then you ordered the magazine

12:26.593 --> 12:28.143
you accused us of ordering for you.

12:28.145 --> 12:29.227
Well, I was drunk!

12:29.229 --> 12:30.512
I don't remember!

12:30.514 --> 12:32.213
How's it feel to be cleared of all charges, Butch?

12:32.215 --> 12:34.295
I gotta tell you, Sundance,
it feels pretty darn good.

12:34.299 --> 12:36.184
- What else does this thing say?
- No, no! Just a lot of boring stuff...

12:36.186 --> 12:37.569
No, I want to see, I want to know

12:37.571 --> 12:38.937
- what Colin had to say.
- (mumbling): No, you don't.

12:38.939 --> 12:41.556
"Short term analysis: female
customer is likely to own a cat".

12:41.558 --> 12:42.891
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I guess I've

12:42.893 --> 12:44.409
taken a liking to Mr. Princess.

12:44.411 --> 12:45.432
- Sydney, you don't want to...
- No, I want

12:45.433 --> 12:47.112
- to read this.
- Okeydokey.

12:47.114 --> 12:48.947
"Long term analysis: female customer's

12:48.949 --> 12:50.281
devotion to career will

12:50.283 --> 12:51.499
likely keep her from having offspring

12:51.501 --> 12:53.952
or forming lasting romantic partnerships.

12:53.954 --> 12:56.504
She will likely remain single until death"?

12:56.506 --> 12:58.373
Don't blame me. Blame the data.

12:58.375 --> 13:00.458
These are just statistics
based upon your behaviors.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.010
But this doesn't have to be your future.

13:02.012 --> 13:03.111
You can affect change.

13:03.113 --> 13:04.596
- How?
- First of all,

13:04.598 --> 13:06.914
I'd consider giving up this
whole cat ownership idea.

13:06.916 --> 13:08.717
I don't own a cat. What makes you think that?

13:08.719 --> 13:10.518
The fanny pack full of cat treats

13:10.520 --> 13:11.936
and the feather tied to a tiny fishing pole

13:11.938 --> 13:13.104
sticking out of your back pocket.

13:13.106 --> 13:15.106
I may have been considering it.

13:15.108 --> 13:16.391
COLIN: What you're about to see

13:16.393 --> 13:18.026
is 100% computer generated.

13:18.028 --> 13:19.978
Oh, I love computers.

13:19.980 --> 13:21.946
Now show me the future of advertising!

You did that?

15:48.428 --> 15:49.410
Yes, I did.

15:49.412 --> 15:52.313
You're Simon Roberts?

I'm Simon Roberts.

Simon Roberts, you're under arrest.

15:57.086 --> 15:58.186
Oh, you're a cop.

15:58.188 --> 15:59.304
- Huh.
- Yeah.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.639
- And you're a graffiti artist.
- Yeah.

16:11.350 --> 16:13.084
Hey, you.

16:14.553 --> 16:15.586
I didn't order coffee.

16:15.588 --> 16:17.655
I just wanted to brighten up your morning.

16:17.657 --> 16:18.990
I know it might be a tough one

16:18.992 --> 16:21.092
with it being Mr. Princess' last day and all.

16:22.461 --> 16:24.078
I like the cat,

16:24.080 --> 16:25.246
but it's just a cat.

16:25.248 --> 16:26.247
I'll be okay.

16:26.249 --> 16:28.365
Oh, no, sure. I know.

16:28.367 --> 16:31.502
It's just... I'm friends with the security guard

16:31.504 --> 16:33.504
and he e-mailed me the footage
from your date last night.

16:33.506 --> 16:35.372
At first I thought it was funny,

16:35.374 --> 16:36.724
which is why I cut in some Barry White

16:36.726 --> 16:37.725
and sent it around the office.

16:37.727 --> 16:38.709
Excuse me?

16:38.711 --> 16:40.544
But I just watched it again

16:40.546 --> 16:41.729
with the guys in accounting.

16:41.731 --> 16:43.180
It's actually really touching.

16:43.182 --> 16:44.565
So I'm here if you need to talk about anything.

SIMON: Last night, when I was in jail,

17:37.820 --> 17:39.954
Anastasia showed me a lot of things.

17:39.956 --> 17:42.206
- Like...?
- Like how easy it is to forge a check.

17:42.208 --> 17:44.125
Also, when you combine two
things that don't go together...

17:44.127 --> 17:45.776
