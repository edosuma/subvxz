WEBVTT

00:01.961 --> 00:03.629
DEWEY: Well, I agree,

00:01.961 --> 00:03.629
Mrs. Wiggins.

00:03.671 --> 00:05.965
These pastries

00:03.671 --> 00:05.965
are delightful.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.551
Hey, son.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.551
What you doing?

00:09.593 --> 00:12.888
I'm having a tea party

00:09.593 --> 00:12.888
with Mrs. Bear and the ladies.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.306
Ah, that's... good.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.975
Would you care to join us?

00:16.016 --> 00:17.058
Yeah, I have

00:17.100 --> 00:18.936
actually a-a...

00:17.100 --> 00:18.936
Hey, you know what?

00:18.978 --> 00:21.271
Why don't we go buy

00:18.978 --> 00:21.271
that Stealth Bomber model

00:21.313 --> 00:23.064
you've been asking for, huh?

00:23.106 --> 00:24.441
Okay.

00:24.483 --> 00:26.025
Okay.

00:27.945 --> 00:31.072

Hey, you guys want

01:08.151 --> 01:09.904
to camp out

01:09.945 --> 01:11.112
in front of

01:09.945 --> 01:11.112
PC World tonight?

01:11.154 --> 01:13.114
The new Norton Antivirus

01:11.154 --> 01:13.114
comes out tomorrow.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.324
Your mom would let you?

01:14.366 --> 01:15.910
She's holding

01:14.366 --> 01:15.910
my place right now.

01:15.951 --> 01:18.037
Are you serious?

01:15.951 --> 01:18.037
What's the big deal?

01:18.078 --> 01:21.122
Sorry, Malcolm, but  we  have

01:18.078 --> 01:21.122
a life outside this place.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.750
How we doing, gentlemen?

01:22.791 --> 01:25.002
Everybody sticking

01:22.791 --> 01:25.002
to the experiment?

01:25.044 --> 01:27.128
Absolutely.

01:25.044 --> 01:27.128
Right on track, sir.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.714
I know

01:27.170 --> 01:28.714
how tempting it is

01:28.756 --> 01:31.967
to stray from

01:28.756 --> 01:31.967
a rigidly defined protocol.

01:32.009 --> 01:35.178
It's the siren's song

01:32.009 --> 01:35.178
of pure research,

01:35.220 --> 01:39.934
but you must resist her

01:35.220 --> 01:39.934
seductive powers because...

01:39.975 --> 01:43.771
ALL: "Unstable compounds

01:39.975 --> 01:43.771
require stable minds."

01:45.397 --> 01:47.232
Jackass.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.860
It's like he's talking

01:47.274 --> 01:49.860
to children.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.162
It was a perfectly

01:59.036 --> 02:01.162
legitimate variation.

02:01.204 --> 02:04.124
There was less than

02:01.204 --> 02:04.124
a 48% chance this would happen.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.045
Well, your cavalier

02:05.626 --> 02:08.045
disregard

02:08.087 --> 02:09.671
for the laws of the classroom--

02:09.713 --> 02:12.549
not to mention the laws

02:09.713 --> 02:12.549
of nature--

02:12.591 --> 02:14.259
have led to the inevitable.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.177
It will now take weeks

02:16.219 --> 02:18.388
to decontaminate

02:16.219 --> 02:18.388
that classroom.

02:18.430 --> 02:21.642
And during that time,

02:18.430 --> 02:21.642
you will all be placed

02:21.683 --> 02:24.185
back into

02:21.683 --> 02:24.185
the general population.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.186
(students gasp)

02:25.228 --> 02:26.229
We can't do that.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.355
The whole school hates us.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.190
They'll destroy us

02:27.397 --> 02:29.190
without realizing

02:29.232 --> 02:32.193
their rage is a projection

02:29.232 --> 02:32.193
of their own insecurities.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.656
And as for me, I've been offered

02:32.235 --> 02:35.656
a temporary position

02:35.697 --> 02:37.282
in the Phys Ed department

02:37.324 --> 02:39.367
where I will get

02:37.324 --> 02:39.367
to wear a whistle

02:39.409 --> 02:42.203
and dress in shorts.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.372
Of course, I'm sure

02:42.245 --> 02:44.372
none of this will be reflected

02:44.414 --> 02:45.958
in your end-of-year grades.

02:48.752 --> 02:52.006
Dewey, don't play connect

02:48.752 --> 02:52.006
the dots with your chicken pox.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.007
You'll get an infection.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.591
I'm bored!

02:53.048 --> 02:54.591
I know, sweetie.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.135
It's no fun being sick.

02:56.175 --> 02:57.928
I'm bored! I'm itchy!

02:57.970 --> 02:59.680
I'm bored!

02:59.721 --> 03:02.724
Honey, remember we were going to

02:59.721 --> 03:02.724
use our not-horrible voice?

03:02.766 --> 03:03.851
I'm bored!

03:03.892 --> 03:05.686
Well, then find

03:03.892 --> 03:05.686
something to do.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.228
Here.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.271
Play with these.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.024
I don't want to.

03:10.065 --> 03:11.316
Dewey, you are

03:10.065 --> 03:11.316
going to be contagious

03:11.358 --> 03:12.943
for the next six days.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.154
Do you want to spend them here

03:12.985 --> 03:15.154
like a good little boy

03:15.194 --> 03:16.404
or in the hospital?

03:16.446 --> 03:18.573
You don't go to the

03:16.446 --> 03:18.573
hospital for chick...

03:19.741 --> 03:21.869
Okay.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.126
Damn it!

03:29.168 --> 03:30.878
Maybe we could tack

03:29.168 --> 03:30.878
up a blanket.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.838
No, that's it. I'm going to tear

03:30.919 --> 03:32.838
the whole porch down

03:32.880 --> 03:34.339
and I'm going to build

03:32.880 --> 03:34.339
another one.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.424
Good luck getting permission

03:34.381 --> 03:36.424
from the Tribal Council.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.927
What?

03:36.466 --> 03:38.927
This part of the house

03:36.466 --> 03:38.927
is on tribal land,

03:38.969 --> 03:42.097
from the window all the

03:38.969 --> 03:42.097
way to the wolf picture.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.348
What are you talking about?

03:43.390 --> 03:45.308
The whole house used to

03:43.390 --> 03:45.308
be on the reservation,

03:45.350 --> 03:47.853
but my idiot grandfather

03:45.350 --> 03:47.853
built it on a glacier.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.189
It's been moving

03:47.895 --> 03:50.189
two inches a year ever since.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.691
In a hundred years, we'll have

03:50.271 --> 03:52.691
a nice view of the lake.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.276
Wow! So, part

03:52.733 --> 03:55.276
of this house

03:55.318 --> 03:58.030
is on an Indian

03:55.318 --> 03:58.030
reservation?

04:01.533 --> 04:03.952
Dealer has 20.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.289
Look at them.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.125
All they're thinking about is

04:10.167 --> 04:12.293
how many different places

04:10.167 --> 04:12.293
they'll dispose of my body.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.712
Hey, Ian, Eddie!

04:13.754 --> 04:15.296
How you doing?

04:19.009 --> 04:21.178
What are you doing?

04:21.220 --> 04:22.721
There's no more seats.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.265
There's a seat

04:22.763 --> 04:25.265
over there.

04:26.725 --> 04:27.893
Scoot over.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.103
Go sit down.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.021
You're going to get

04:29.144 --> 04:31.021
in trouble.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.233
Hey.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.316
Hey.

04:35.358 --> 04:36.317
'Sup?

04:36.359 --> 04:37.819
'Sup?

04:37.861 --> 04:40.948
God, it's so great to have

04:37.861 --> 04:40.948
a normal conversation.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.412
Abandon all hope,

04:44.534 --> 04:47.412
ye who enter here.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.581
Is that from

04:47.454 --> 04:49.581
the new Ministry album?

04:49.623 --> 04:50.498
What?

04:50.540 --> 04:52.209
"Abandon All Hope."

04:52.251 --> 04:54.128
Is that from

04:52.251 --> 04:54.128
the new Ministry album?

04:54.169 --> 04:56.171
Actually, it's from

04:54.169 --> 04:56.171
Dante's  Inferno.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.548
It's the inscription

04:56.213 --> 04:58.548
over the Gates of Hell.

04:58.590 --> 05:02.302
That is  way  dark.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.225
BOY: You should kick

05:06.556 --> 05:08.225
that guy's butt.

05:08.267 --> 05:09.851
Remember when I

05:08.267 --> 05:09.851
kicked his butt?

05:09.893 --> 05:11.019
No, he kicked  your  butt.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.353
(laughter)

05:12.395 --> 05:13.772
You want me to

05:12.395 --> 05:13.772
kick  your  butt?

05:24.283 --> 05:26.451
Ah! Damn! Splinter!

05:26.493 --> 05:28.369
You are dead! You are dead!

05:28.411 --> 05:29.579
(groans)

05:29.621 --> 05:31.165
Don't pick!

05:29.621 --> 05:31.165
It'll get infected.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.457
What?

05:32.499 --> 05:34.668
You're making it worse.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.668
Let me get it out for you.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.377
You carry a first-aid

05:34.709 --> 05:36.377
kit with you?

05:36.419 --> 05:37.879
Just a crisis pouch.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.840
I leave the kit

05:37.921 --> 05:39.840
in my locker.

05:39.881 --> 05:40.966
There.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.384
Wow, that didn't

05:41.008 --> 05:43.384
hurt at all.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.928
Thanks.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.393
HAL:

05:50.642 --> 05:52.393
Hey, Dewey.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.480
Wow! Look at that!

05:55.522 --> 05:58.108
Is this helping take your

05:55.522 --> 05:58.108
mind off the itching?

05:58.150 --> 06:00.068
It was.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.904
Wow, you got a split,

06:00.110 --> 06:02.904
and you got a crossover.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.323
(chuckles)

06:04.363 --> 06:06.407
All those dominoes.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.785
All set up.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.746
Just ready to...

06:18.545 --> 06:21.131
Hey, check out Alicia.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.008
En fuego.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.344
Totally.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.428
Yeah, she's cute.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.514
Ah, check out Pam.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.641
Muy en fuego.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.144
Totally.

06:34.186 --> 06:36.395
Yeah,

06:34.186 --> 06:36.395
she's cute, too.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.441
Excuse me.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.361
DABNEY:

06:40.483 --> 06:42.361
And then...

06:42.401 --> 06:43.653
and it went like "Boing!"

06:43.695 --> 06:44.821
And then...

06:44.863 --> 06:46.405
I could download some of this...

06:47.490 --> 06:51.036
(hip-hop song playing)

06:51.078 --> 06:52.453
Hey, Stevie.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.539
So, it looks like

06:52.495 --> 06:54.539
everyone found a place.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.333
Parasites...

06:56.375 --> 07:00.670
adapting...

06:56.375 --> 07:00.670
to a new... host body.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.923
Except Herkabe, I guess.

07:04.507 --> 07:05.759
BOY:

07:04.507 --> 07:05.759
This sucks.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.302
We just heard the

07:05.800 --> 07:07.302
cleanup crew's going

07:07.344 --> 07:08.636
to put their dumpster

07:07.344 --> 07:08.636
where we skate.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.555
Where are we

07:08.678 --> 07:10.555
supposed to go?

07:10.597 --> 07:12.140
Why do they always

07:10.597 --> 07:12.140
have to pick on us?

07:12.182 --> 07:13.474
It's not like

07:12.182 --> 07:13.474
we  destroyed a classroom.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.810
Damn... Krelboynes.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.147
I'll think... of something.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.776
IAN:

07:21.524 --> 07:22.776
Hey, Malcolm.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.194
Can you settle this?

07:24.236 --> 07:25.320
You know Stacy?

07:25.362 --> 07:26.487
Yeah.

07:26.529 --> 07:29.449
Is she  en fuego

07:26.529 --> 07:29.449
or  muy en fuego?

07:31.910 --> 07:33.494
Hard to say.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.500
My God!

07:39.542 --> 07:42.587
Dewey, look what

07:39.542 --> 07:42.587
you've built here!

07:42.629 --> 07:45.590
You have stairs and a ramp!

07:47.134 --> 07:50.304
You've spelled your name.

07:50.345 --> 07:54.474
Oh, so many, many dominoes.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.103
Where did they all

07:56.351 --> 07:58.103
come from?

07:58.145 --> 07:59.813
Mom got them

07:58.145 --> 07:59.813
from the Lippers.

07:59.854 --> 08:02.565
They got a whole crate the year

07:59.854 --> 08:02.565
Mr. Lipper was paralyzed.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.693
They even buried him

08:02.607 --> 08:05.693
with one of his dominoes.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.695
So this isn't really

08:05.735 --> 08:07.695
a complete set.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.531
Oh, no, Dewey.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.531
Don't scratch.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.992
But it's itchy.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.992
I know.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.785
But sometimes you just

08:12.033 --> 08:13.785
have to restrain yourself,

08:13.827 --> 08:17.789
even if you feel like ripping

08:13.827 --> 08:17.789
your eyes out of their sockets

08:17.831 --> 08:20.583
rather than go

08:17.831 --> 08:20.583
one more second without...

08:20.625 --> 08:22.461
scratching.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.962
Will you watch

08:22.502 --> 08:23.962
this for me?

08:24.004 --> 08:25.339
I have to go

08:24.004 --> 08:25.339
to the bathroom.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.507
Okay, son.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.764
(gasps)

08:44.191 --> 08:45.650
LOIS:

08:44.191 --> 08:45.650
Reese!

08:45.692 --> 08:47.610
Don't even think

08:45.692 --> 08:47.610
about it!

08:47.652 --> 08:49.154
What's going on?

08:49.196 --> 08:50.571
He was about to knock

08:49.196 --> 08:50.571
down Dewey's dominoes.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.449
What?! Shame on you!

08:52.491 --> 08:53.574
I didn't do anything.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.035
And you're not going to.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.035
Ow!

08:55.076 --> 08:58.372
Those dominoes are keeping Dewey

08:55.076 --> 08:58.372
from driving me crazy,

08:58.413 --> 09:01.208
and if they get knocked over,

08:58.413 --> 09:01.208
I will blame you.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.584
If a door slams shut

09:01.249 --> 09:03.584
and knocks them over,

09:03.626 --> 09:04.752
I will blame you.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.629
If there is an earthquake,

09:04.794 --> 09:06.629
I will blame you.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.466
If a condor dies in flight

09:06.671 --> 09:09.466
and crashes through our roof

09:09.508 --> 09:11.259
and knocks them over,

09:09.508 --> 09:11.259
I will blame you.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.386
But that's not fair.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.721
I will blame you!

09:19.518 --> 09:20.643
Don't even think about it.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.312
What?

09:20.685 --> 09:22.312
I saw that look.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.897
What look?

09:22.354 --> 09:23.897
My look.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.606
Now I know

09:23.938 --> 09:25.606
where I got it from.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.235
I have no idea what

09:25.648 --> 09:28.235
you're talking about.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.610
I'm going to get a drink.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.695
Let's go.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.865
I can get it myself.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.367
It's all right.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.001
Man, I can't believe

09:43.458 --> 09:45.001
the school gave

09:45.043 --> 09:46.627
the Skaters our

09:45.043 --> 09:46.627
basketball court.

09:46.669 --> 09:47.628
Crazy.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.630
"Skater Safety Program"?

09:49.672 --> 09:51.091
Sounds suspicious.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.633
So what do we do?

09:52.675 --> 09:53.634
We kick their butts.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.719
Yeah.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.888
Guys, guys!

09:54.761 --> 09:56.888
There's an easier way.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.848
We'll take over

09:56.930 --> 09:58.848
the East Court.

09:58.890 --> 10:01.684
No, that's where the Goths

09:58.890 --> 10:01.684
hang out and smoke.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.645
Why don't you let me worry

10:01.726 --> 10:04.645
about the Goths.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.273
They can't take away our court.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.442
That's where

10:06.314 --> 10:08.442
I secondhand smoke!

10:08.483 --> 10:10.318
Some old lady who lives

10:08.483 --> 10:10.318
next door to the school

10:10.360 --> 10:11.570
complained we were scaring her.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.113
No, you weren't.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.655
Look at this handwriting.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.533
The loops, the girlish swirls.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.285
This is no old lady.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.660
It's Dabney.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.455
Well, where are we supposed

10:19.702 --> 10:21.455
to go now?

10:21.496 --> 10:24.665
What about the Posers' corner?

10:24.707 --> 10:27.043
You be trippin' if you

10:24.707 --> 10:27.043
think you're gonna stop us.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.670
You better bust a move

10:27.085 --> 10:29.670
'cause this is our turf now!

10:29.712 --> 10:30.922
But we're in the middle of

10:30.964 --> 10:32.340
a very important

10:30.964 --> 10:32.340
Student Council meeting.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.509
That ain't no thang!

10:34.551 --> 10:37.137
The thang is 200 years of

10:34.551 --> 10:37.137
oppression in this country!

10:37.178 --> 10:38.679
What are you talking about?

10:38.721 --> 10:39.764
It's off the hook!

10:39.806 --> 10:41.558
Justice in the '02!

10:41.600 --> 10:44.603
You haven't heard

10:41.600 --> 10:44.603
the last of this.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.896
Sucka!

10:46.938 --> 10:49.274
Um, Kevin?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.568
You're supposed to wear

10:49.316 --> 10:51.568
underwear with those.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.738
BOY:

10:53.987 --> 10:55.738
Get out of here.

10:55.780 --> 10:56.781
Get out of here, man.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.618
(students clamoring)

10:59.659 --> 11:00.785
HERKABE:

10:59.659 --> 11:00.785
Don't make me blow this!

11:00.827 --> 11:03.704
Do not make me blow this!

11:03.746 --> 11:05.999
(blowing air)

11:06.040 --> 11:08.084
Who removed my whistle pea?!

11:08.126 --> 11:09.836
That is

11:08.126 --> 11:09.836
a detentionable offense!

11:18.761 --> 11:19.971
(gasps)

11:27.354 --> 11:29.730
It's awfully tempting,

11:27.354 --> 11:29.730
isn't it, Hal?

11:30.773 --> 11:31.941
Go ahead.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.818
I'll blame it on Reese.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.279
You'll get off scot-free.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.994
All right, pencils down!

11:43.036 --> 11:45.163
Turn in your geometry tests.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.499
But I didn't study!

11:48.833 --> 11:50.502
(gasps)

11:53.004 --> 11:54.631
(sighs)

11:59.802 --> 12:00.761
(gasps)

12:00.803 --> 12:03.139
Turn around, old man.

12:03.181 --> 12:05.517
There's nothing

12:03.181 --> 12:05.517
for you here.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.272
I can't take this anymore.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.400
If I hear one more  "en fuego..."

12:28.415 --> 12:30.417
(ball pops)

12:34.421 --> 12:36.548
(school bell ringing)

12:46.140 --> 12:48.809
And six on top for the dealer.

12:48.851 --> 12:49.852
Whoops.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.271
Redeal.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.689
Hey! I had blackjack.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.442
You're cheating me

12:53.856 --> 12:55.442
out of my winnings.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.443
Come on, relax.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.818
I don't want any trouble.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.029
It's all in the tribe, right?

13:00.863 --> 13:02.616
Let's just calm down.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.200
I don't want to hear it.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.536
This is the same kind of thing

13:04.242 --> 13:06.536
your old man used to pull.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.037
He was nothing

13:06.578 --> 13:08.037
but a lying

13:08.079 --> 13:09.330
drunken jackass.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.124
Tell me something

13:09.372 --> 13:11.124
I don't know.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.834
Look, this was just a

13:11.165 --> 13:13.834
little misunderstanding.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.836
There, you got

13:13.876 --> 13:15.836
your chips back.

13:15.878 --> 13:16.837
See?

13:16.879 --> 13:19.299
We take care of

13:16.879 --> 13:19.299
our own here.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.053
Francis, maybe you shouldn't...

13:24.095 --> 13:26.889
Don't worry. I'll turn the fan

13:24.095 --> 13:26.889
back on once Ivan leaves.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.101
LOIS:

13:28.683 --> 13:30.101
Dewey?

13:30.143 --> 13:31.519
I just spoke with the doctor.

13:31.561 --> 13:32.853
He says you can go back

13:31.561 --> 13:32.853
to school tomorrow.

13:32.895 --> 13:33.854
Okay.

13:33.896 --> 13:34.897
Tomorrow?

13:34.939 --> 13:36.524
So... so the dominoes...

13:36.566 --> 13:38.318
Go back in the

13:36.566 --> 13:38.318
crate tonight.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.864
Let me make this

13:42.280 --> 13:43.864
easy for you.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.326
I'm not leaving this house

13:43.906 --> 13:46.326
until I know you're at work.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.161
And I can wait

13:46.367 --> 13:48.161
all day.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.288
All I've got is school.

13:53.792 --> 13:54.793
Hey, Malcolm.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.336
Look, I'm sorry.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.879
I can't listen to you guys

13:56.377 --> 13:58.879
talk about who's totally hot,

13:58.921 --> 14:00.548
who's  en fuego.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.259
That stuff used to sound fine

14:00.590 --> 14:03.259
to me, but now it's just stupid.

14:03.301 --> 14:04.344
You guys are stupid.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.804
I don't mean that

14:05.844 --> 14:06.887
in an insulting way.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.515
I mean that in a factual way.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.600
You want to say "hot"

14:08.556 --> 14:10.600
in a different language?

14:10.642 --> 14:12.686
There are

14:10.642 --> 14:12.686
700 different languages.

14:12.727 --> 14:13.894
Vary it a little.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.814
We just came to tell you

14:13.936 --> 14:15.814
that there's

14:15.854 --> 14:17.774
a fight going down

14:15.854 --> 14:17.774
at the schoolyard.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.400
Between who?

14:17.816 --> 14:19.400
Everybody.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.110
Oh, man!

14:23.738 --> 14:27.200
Hey, come on, dealer,

14:23.738 --> 14:27.200
let's go!

14:27.241 --> 14:29.994
And that's, uh,

14:27.241 --> 14:29.994
seven for the dealer.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.705
Piama.

14:31.746 --> 14:33.498
Where have you been?

14:31.746 --> 14:33.498
Shopping.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.833
You were supposed

14:33.540 --> 14:34.833
to relieve me.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.334
Do you have any idea

14:34.874 --> 14:36.334
what time it is?

14:36.376 --> 14:37.960
Now I do.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.004
Where did you get the money

14:38.002 --> 14:40.004
for all that stuff?

14:40.046 --> 14:41.922
I took 200 bucks

14:40.046 --> 14:41.922
from the stash.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.133
But that's all our money.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.133
We can't afford that.

14:44.175 --> 14:46.886
Well, you know,

14:44.175 --> 14:46.886
it's all in the tribe.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.821
Ha!

15:04.863 --> 15:05.905
(gasps)

15:08.867 --> 15:10.869
Wha... Wha...

15:10.910 --> 15:14.163
What happened

15:10.910 --> 15:14.163
to the dominoes?

15:14.205 --> 15:15.540
I cleaned them up.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.959
You knocked them over

15:15.582 --> 15:18.959
without me?

15:19.001 --> 15:20.628
Why would I knock them over?

15:20.670 --> 15:22.963
I spent four days

15:20.670 --> 15:22.963
setting them up.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.135
What's going on?

15:28.177 --> 15:29.970
Why did you spend

15:28.177 --> 15:29.970
all of that money?

15:30.012 --> 15:30.971
Hey,

15:31.013 --> 15:32.139
you were the one talking about

15:32.181 --> 15:33.683
easing the suffering

15:32.181 --> 15:33.683
of our people.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.644
Well, I suffered

15:33.725 --> 15:36.644
a little less today.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.688
You don't just go

15:36.686 --> 15:38.688
and spend a bunch of money

15:38.730 --> 15:39.814
and not say anything.

15:39.856 --> 15:40.981
What's the problem?

15:41.023 --> 15:42.983
It's all in the tribe, right?

15:43.025 --> 15:44.861
That's what this is about?

15:44.903 --> 15:47.988
What, am I overstepping

15:44.903 --> 15:47.988
my bounds because I'm white?

15:48.030 --> 15:49.616
No, but it's...

15:49.657 --> 15:51.284
it feels weird.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.035
Look, we're married.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.622
That means I'm a part of

15:53.077 --> 15:55.622
your family and culture

15:55.663 --> 15:57.290
just like you're

15:55.663 --> 15:57.290
a part of mine.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.584
Believe me, if I had

15:57.331 --> 15:59.584
anything in my heritage

15:59.626 --> 16:01.878
besides crappy minivans

15:59.626 --> 16:01.878
and non-stop screaming,

16:01.920 --> 16:03.045
I'd share it with you.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.464
It's not the same!

16:04.505 --> 16:06.382
Oh, so because

16:04.505 --> 16:06.382
I'm not your people,

16:06.424 --> 16:08.301
I don't deserve

16:06.424 --> 16:08.301
any of that money?

16:08.342 --> 16:10.637
Why are you so obsessed

16:08.342 --> 16:10.637
about the money?!

16:10.678 --> 16:11.596
Because

16:11.638 --> 16:12.847
I want to pay off Lavernia

16:12.889 --> 16:14.307
so we can finally

16:12.889 --> 16:14.307
get out of here.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.684
What do you mean get out

16:14.348 --> 16:16.684
of here? We live here.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.018
What?

16:18.060 --> 16:19.729
You want to spend

16:18.060 --> 16:19.729
the rest of your life

16:19.771 --> 16:21.063
in this godforsaken place?

16:21.105 --> 16:23.441
This godforsaken place

16:21.105 --> 16:23.441
is where I grew up.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.901
It's our home.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.611
If you had a problem

16:24.943 --> 16:26.611
with living here,

16:26.653 --> 16:28.028
you should have said something.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.405
I have been complaining

16:28.070 --> 16:29.405
about this place

16:29.447 --> 16:30.740
since you've known me.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.659
I thought you were

16:30.782 --> 16:32.659
just a complainer.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.911
You complain about everything!

16:34.953 --> 16:36.329
Yeah, but this is real.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.038
I hate this place.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.541
I can't even imagine

16:38.080 --> 16:40.541
raising our kids here.

16:40.583 --> 16:41.668
Kids?!

16:41.709 --> 16:43.127
I hate kids!

16:47.298 --> 16:49.258
These seem like

16:47.298 --> 16:49.258
some pretty big issues.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.051
Yeah.

16:51.093 --> 16:54.054
You know,

16:51.093 --> 16:54.054
we got married so fast...

16:54.096 --> 16:57.558
So what are we going to do?

17:01.896 --> 17:03.982
And we both like

17:01.896 --> 17:03.982
wrestling movies.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.065
Yeah.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.317
And we both like pizza.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.485
I love pizza.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.069
Sausage and mushroom?

17:09.111 --> 17:10.154
Yeah.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.323
On half.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.368
(grunting)

17:23.543 --> 17:26.086
We wait till the Jocks

17:23.543 --> 17:26.086
take out the Goths,

17:26.128 --> 17:27.672
and then we swoop in.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.549
I've made an alliance

17:27.714 --> 17:29.549
with the Drama Club.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.967
They've got swords.

17:31.009 --> 17:33.011
And when the Skaters

17:31.009 --> 17:33.011
see me drop my cape,

17:33.052 --> 17:34.345
they'll come in on the flank.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.764
No one will expect us

17:34.387 --> 17:36.764
to be working together.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.098
Are you sure

17:36.806 --> 17:38.098
this is a good idea?

17:38.140 --> 17:40.100
It's too late

17:38.140 --> 17:40.100
for second thoughts.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.102
The tribes have Balkanized.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.145
(sighs)

17:43.187 --> 17:44.522
They don't like each other.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.024
Oh.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.109
We don't stop

17:46.065 --> 17:49.109
until we have total control.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.543
Deploy special shield!

18:05.585 --> 18:08.546
KIDS (chanting):

18:05.585 --> 18:08.546
We're just right, we're okay.

18:08.588 --> 18:12.008
We're smarter now

18:08.588 --> 18:12.008
than yesterday.

18:12.050 --> 18:14.052
School is hard,

18:12.050 --> 18:14.052
but school is fun.

18:14.093 --> 18:18.097
'Cause learning is for everyone!

18:19.015 --> 18:20.934
They got Darren.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.934
He bites.

18:20.975 --> 18:21.768
No!

18:21.809 --> 18:23.143
Stop!

18:23.185 --> 18:24.645
This has gone too far!

18:24.687 --> 18:26.731
Look what you've

18:24.687 --> 18:26.731
been reduced to.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.190
BOY:

18:26.773 --> 18:28.190
I'm helping!

18:28.232 --> 18:30.359
We all used to hate

18:28.232 --> 18:30.359
this school equally.

18:30.401 --> 18:32.445
We hated

18:30.401 --> 18:32.445
the teachers.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.154
We hated the

18:32.486 --> 18:34.154
administration.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.074
We hated the building.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.785
But now you've taken

18:36.115 --> 18:38.785
that perfectly good hate

18:38.826 --> 18:40.745
and turned it

18:38.826 --> 18:40.745
against each other.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.996
And why?

18:42.038 --> 18:43.623
Because people

18:42.038 --> 18:43.623
dress differently

18:43.664 --> 18:45.041
or talk differently?

18:45.083 --> 18:47.043
You're just making school

18:45.083 --> 18:47.043
even worse.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.168
Dabney was a Krelboyne

18:48.210 --> 18:50.880
two weeks ago, and

18:48.210 --> 18:50.880
now he's a Jock.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.633
That proves that these

18:50.922 --> 18:53.633
differences are meaningless.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.176
We need to focus

18:53.674 --> 18:56.176
on what makes us the same,

18:56.218 --> 19:00.139
because if we hate each other,

18:56.218 --> 19:00.139
who's going to hate school?

19:02.100 --> 19:04.184
You were a Krelboyne?

19:04.226 --> 19:06.771
Ha! You've got

19:04.226 --> 19:06.771
a Krelboyne.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.898
You guys got a Krelboyne

19:06.813 --> 19:08.898
right behind you.

19:08.940 --> 19:12.359
He's the one who wanted

19:08.940 --> 19:12.359
to fight in the first place.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.403
BOY:

19:12.401 --> 19:14.403
Hey, we got one, too!

19:14.445 --> 19:15.446
GIRL:

19:14.445 --> 19:15.446
I found one!

19:15.488 --> 19:17.698
(students murmuring)

19:24.413 --> 19:26.666
He's our leader!

19:34.423 --> 19:36.258
If it's any consolation,

19:36.300 --> 19:38.719
we get our new classroom

19:36.300 --> 19:38.719
in five weeks.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.014
(students sobbing)

19:41.055 --> 19:43.223
Thanks for the heads up

19:41.055 --> 19:43.223
on the underwear.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.433
No problem.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.602
What is with the self-pity?

19:46.644 --> 19:50.523
Albert Einstein had to carry

19:46.644 --> 19:50.523
spare pants until he was 24.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.399
And did he cry about it? No.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.401
He drew on

19:52.441 --> 19:54.401
that experience

19:54.443 --> 19:57.488
and helped build

19:54.443 --> 19:57.488
the first nuclear bomb.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.656
Now, buck up

19:58.698 --> 20:00.449
and get in the van.

20:20.011 --> 20:23.681
Oh, video camera.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.475
Oh...
