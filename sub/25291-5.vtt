WEBVTT

00:43.080 --> 00:45.059
(Laughter and playful chatter)

00:46.800 --> 00:49.621
DEMELZ4:
Dearest
R055,
you are safely missed

00:49.800 --> 00:51.461
by your ch/Yo'ren, your wife,

00:51.640 --> 00:52.959
your 0'09"-

00:53.120 --> 00:55.259
and by a// at home for whom you speak.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.305
-(Shouﬁng)
SPEAKER: Order! Order!

00:57.480 --> 00:59.027
- Gentlemen!
ROSS: Mr Speaker,

00:59.200 --> 01:01.657
the Honourable Member for llchester

01:01.840 --> 01:04.946
has suggested that poverty is a condition

01:05.120 --> 01:07.543
that Christianity may condone.

01:07.720 --> 01:11.304
May I inform him
that his arguments are repellent

01:11.480 --> 01:13.698
as...as they are fatuous.

01:13.880 --> 01:14.949
Sit down!

01:15.120 --> 01:18.544
This week we ’Ve heard again
how scarcity of fooo’ does take its toll.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.860
There's fever in Sawle.
Six failing, four dead.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.019
If they were stronger they could fight it.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.020
But they've barely a crust between 'em.

01:26.200 --> 01:29.943
Shamefully some here
consider it acceptable

01:30.120 --> 01:34.022
for small children to be regarded
as inevitable casualties

01:34.200 --> 01:36.782
of our current food shortages.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.064
(Jeering)

01:39.240 --> 01:42.027
Some blame the war,
some the poor harvest

01:42.200 --> 01:46.660
Yet how can it be that a man has work
yet st/// can ’t afford to feed h/s fam/iy?

01:47.880 --> 01:52.658
Mr Speaker, yet again
this House declines to endorse a bill

01:52.840 --> 01:55.627
to enforce a fixed price for grain.

01:55.800 --> 02:00.737
Is it a mere coincidence that many
of our Members are also corn merchants?

02:00.920 --> 02:02.785
-(Shouﬁng)
- And how long...

02:02.960 --> 02:07.829
how long will we turn a blind eye
to the suffering of the needy?

02:08.000 --> 02:10.560
If they're that needy,
let them apply to the poorhouse!

02:10.720 --> 02:12.187
(Some shouts of agreement)

02:12.360 --> 02:16.547
Nothing the House dislikes more than
inconvenient truths thrust in its face!

02:16.720 --> 02:20.747
- How does one ever get anything done?
- Patience. Stealth.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.899
Compromise.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.667
Guineas?

02:27.520 --> 02:31.945
- This child is malnourished.
- Cap'n Ross did vow to put an end to this.

02:32.120 --> 02:35.021
Nay, Sam, he went to Westminster
to begin the process.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.259
But what 'ave he achieved?

02:37.440 --> 02:39.579
Since he went away,
'ave aught changed?

02:40.680 --> 02:44.059
BASSET: How is your wife?
Commanding the house at home?

02:44.240 --> 02:46.947
With more distinction than I can do here!

02:47.120 --> 02:49.623
For all the use I am,
I might as well be in Cornwall.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.177
Well, you can surely be of use to His Lordship.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.260
Is not his bill clue to come before the House?

02:54.440 --> 02:56.658
The new road through St Day?

02:56.840 --> 02:59.582
And the demolition of half a village
to make way for it.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.660
- He'll be counting on your support.
- Yes.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.819
He's made that very clear.

03:06.760 --> 03:10.503
- So, it appears we are heartless brutes!
ELIZABETH: Who says so?

03:10.680 --> 03:12.261
Oh, the "starving poor".

03:12.440 --> 03:15.307
Apparently, by conspiring
to keep grain prices high,

03:15.480 --> 03:18.142
we are "filling our coffers at their expense".

03:18.320 --> 03:21.107
Surely the starving poor"
should be thanking you.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.225
- For providing employment?
- And how do I do that?

03:23.400 --> 03:25.823
By ensuring that all of my businesses
remain in profit.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.025
- Quite.
- Of course, if the "starving poor"

03:28.200 --> 03:31.658
require me to make less profit-
by demanding a fall in the price of grain -

03:31.840 --> 03:35.617
then I will be unable to employ so many of them
and they will be all the poorer.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.700
(Laughter)

03:40.880 --> 03:42.859
(Birds chirruping)

03:44.120 --> 03:46.099
(Low chatter)

03:46.680 --> 03:48.898
(Laughter and chatter)

03:49.080 --> 03:51.059
(Low chatter)

03:51.560 --> 03:53.869
- Ah!
- Captain Poldark!

03:54.040 --> 03:56.099
Are you here to look after your constituents?

03:56.280 --> 03:59.101
That is the task of an MP, is it not?

03:59.280 --> 04:01.066
Have we met?

04:01.720 --> 04:03.108
Not in the House, at any rate.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.587
My Lord, will you and the Captain
join me this evening?

04:08.760 --> 04:09.863
A small gathering.

04:10.040 --> 04:12.600
No more than a hundred
of your closest friends?

04:12.760 --> 04:14.580
A pleasure, ma'am.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.062
Good day.

04:17.240 --> 04:18.946
MONK ADDERLEY:
What a tiresome fellow.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.189
(Caroline giggles)

04:20.360 --> 04:25.263
- A lost child is not easily forgot.
- Unless one comes to London.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.257
A slight fever but no cause for alarm.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.138
I know I worry overmuch.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.865
Forgive me, Mrs Whitworth...

04:46.280 --> 04:51.479
You are aware your husband once suggested
that you might harm the child?

04:52.200 --> 04:55.226
- I would never do so.
- I entirely believe you...

04:56.800 --> 04:58.745
...but why say it?

04:58.920 --> 05:04.222
It's the only weapon I have
against my husband's...attentions.

05:14.240 --> 05:18.700
'Tis a little bare and cheerless,
but...a woman's touch...

05:20.280 --> 05:22.259
Rosina's?

05:23.640 --> 05:25.619
You have a taking for her, don't you?

05:25.800 --> 05:27.347
Well, somewhat.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.544
Hah.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.859
But 'tisn't love, sister.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.779
At least, not what I recollect of love.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.746
But that love can never come again.

05:36.880 --> 05:37.949
I know it.

05:38.120 --> 05:43.319
And Rosina don't rattle away like other girls.
She's...quiet, thoughtful and kind.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.907
And, in time, love might grow.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.945
Is that how it was for you?

05:48.960 --> 05:50.461
No. (Chuckles)

05:50.640 --> 05:54.269
'Twas with me always.
But...not with Ross.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.179
He did not love me when first we wed.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.588
But he came to.

06:06.480 --> 06:10.428
Do you not think, Vicar, that my new gown
deserves matching slippers?

06:11.520 --> 06:13.306
Oh...

06:33.080 --> 06:36.299
I...may be obliged to limit these visits.

06:36.760 --> 06:37.829
Yes, Vicar.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.777
In fact, it will be for the best
when I no longer visit at all.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.939
Whatever you say, Vicar.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.299
(Chatter)

06:52.120 --> 06:54.099
(Clock chiming in distance)

06:56.120 --> 06:57.508
(Knock at door)

07:00.240 --> 07:04.062
Mrs Parkins, do you know,
is there a poorhouse hereabouts?

07:04.240 --> 07:06.743
St Leonard's, sir.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.343
My nephew's there.
To my shame!

07:09.520 --> 07:12.944
Is he in debt?
Has he lost employment?

07:13.120 --> 07:17.864
Oh, no, sir, he had wages,
just not enough to live on.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.898
Miss Cane...

07:35.080 --> 07:39.301
your experience in dealing with
unstable and aggressive patients

07:39.480 --> 07:40.947
will prove invaluable.

07:42.600 --> 07:47.537
Every time I approach my wife,
to...comfort her as only a husband can...

07:48.760 --> 07:51.137
...she vows to murder our son.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.787
What can be done?

07:52.960 --> 07:54.939
(Birds chirruping)

08:02.840 --> 08:05.263
No, please. Please.

08:05.440 --> 08:06.828
Please, don't.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.108
(SObs)

08:41.320 --> 08:42.981
(Man clears throat)

08:45.760 --> 08:49.059
'Ee must know...that I've a liking for thee?

08:51.120 --> 08:55.147
_An' 'tis on _that account
that I wrsh to explain what's In my heart.

08:56.400 --> 09:00.427
For ye've maybe heard rumours
of a girl I did once love.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.417
An' maybe 'twas ill-wish'd from the start.

09:05.480 --> 09:07.266
But love her I did...

09:08.560 --> 09:10.346
...an' love her I always shall.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.779
'Tis a hard thing to hear, I know.

09:20.640 --> 09:26.419
But I can't abear to say what next I wish to say,
without 'ee knowin' the truth.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.461
I like 'ee...

09:31.760 --> 09:34.547
...take pleasure in your company...

09:35.720 --> 09:40.225
I can offer 'ee a home, a hearth...

09:41.640 --> 09:45.098
...a quiet yet comfortable living.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.706
Maybe you'll go off
an' think it over, an'...

10:03.080 --> 10:05.389
...in due time give me your answer.

10:06.320 --> 10:07.708
No, Drake.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.388
I need no time.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.337
You're a brave and honest man...

10:17.160 --> 10:20.106
...and I believe our life together will be good.

10:30.200 --> 10:34.466
May I call tomorrow...
to ask your father's permission?

10:54.800 --> 10:57.621
- (Bell tolling)
- (Classical music in distance)

10:57.800 --> 11:00.018
(Chatter and laughter)

11:03.720 --> 11:06.302
- Yes. _
- (Chatter continues)

11:07.600 --> 11:09.579
Good evening, sir.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.800
- Who are these people?
- My new acquaintances.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.905
From London, Oxford, Bath...

11:27.080 --> 11:28.581
Not from Cornwall.

11:28.760 --> 11:32.025
Sometimes the last thing one wants
is to be reminded of home.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.543
Ah, here's Captain Adderley.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.659
GEORGE: You see his game?

11:47.840 --> 11:52.539
Squiring her around London, so as to
ingratiate himself further into high society.

11:53.120 --> 11:56.146
- Enys would not be impressed.
- Nor Demelza.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.425
Is there scurvy in Mellin?

12:07.600 --> 12:09.625
I sent my steward with potatoes and carrots.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.825
There's no oranges to be had
for love nor money.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.946
This is for the mine.
But how many it'll feed...

12:15.120 --> 12:16.701
(Door opens)

12:25.080 --> 12:26.661
Do it not make a body wonder?

12:27.720 --> 12:29.585
What they London folk get up to?

12:29.760 --> 12:33.639
I hope they have a care for one another.
As your mistress and I do here.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.779
Hmm/

12:37.920 --> 12:39.706
Tin't proper...

12:40.320 --> 12:42.106
(Door closes)

12:44.760 --> 12:49.345
It's...true that of late I've come to regard
this as more of a home than Killewarren.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.504
The children's laughter consoles me.

12:53.080 --> 12:56.220
Sometimes at Killewarren
I find the Silence oppresswe.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.106
Nights especially.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.066
Do you picture them ever?

13:00.240 --> 13:03.459
Ross and Caroline, together,
in a world of which we have no part.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.619
Might not fit, as they fit in.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.140
- Do you not sometimes wonder...
- if...they'd met each other before they met us.

13:12.320 --> 13:15.300
- ...they'd be better matched.
- (Chuckles) Would we?

13:20.160 --> 13:21.627
Happy ever, sister.

13:21.800 --> 13:22.983
Rosina said yes!

13:23.160 --> 13:24.661
- Oh...
- That's cheerful news!

13:24.840 --> 13:27.786
An' a blessin'.
For though Rosina be not of the connection,

13:27.960 --> 13:30.337
she's a God-fearing girl
and will surely mend his ways.

13:30.520 --> 13:33.819
- And his heart, it's to be hoped.
- That especially.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.179
(Chatter and laughter)

13:52.600 --> 13:54.500
Ah, Mrs Warleggan.

13:54.680 --> 13:57.183
Captain P is out of favour!

13:57.920 --> 13:58.989
What makes you say so?

13:59.160 --> 14:03.267
Well, relations between you
seem less warm than that night at Trenwith.

14:04.600 --> 14:08.149
Ross? Was at my house?

14:08.320 --> 14:09.947
In your gardens.

14:10.920 --> 14:13.229
I took him for an errant troubadour.

14:13.640 --> 14:15.267
You don't recall me telling you?

14:17.280 --> 14:19.225
Because your mind
was more agreeably occupied.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.267
It was the night
you vowed to return to Parliament.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.701
Ah.

14:24.880 --> 14:26.780
Of course.
That would account for it.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.097
Mm.

14:35.080 --> 14:38.379
I do wonder that such a thing escaped me.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.986
The thought of Ross - and my property...

14:41.160 --> 14:43.344
My dear, must we revisit the subject?

14:44.560 --> 14:46.061
Did we not agree?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.264
Suspicion has no place in a marriage.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.707
We did agree.

14:56.880 --> 14:58.859
Your hat, sir.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.582
- The night is young.
- And I am not.

15:04.760 --> 15:07.342
I have a full day in Parliament tomorrow.

15:07.520 --> 15:11.547
Well, I have no intention of retiring until
I fall asleep the moment I close my eyes.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.906
I see that.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.359
(Door opens)

15:34.520 --> 15:36.499
Ossie.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.107
- (Door slams)
- Why are you here?

15:42.360 --> 15:46.057
What are you doing, Ossie?
You know what I told you.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.266
Yes, my dear.
That you would murder our son.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.264
But Miss Cane is here now.

15:52.440 --> 15:57.184
She will never let him out of her sight.
So your threat...is quite futile.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.360
But your duty remains.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.783
So let us say a little prayer...

16:06.280 --> 16:07.941
...and then you will submit to me.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.379
(Low chatter)

16:47.560 --> 16:49.346
(Chatter continues)

16:50.160 --> 16:52.185
Oi, you! Away with you!

16:56.720 --> 16:58.108
Move on.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.303
(Man coughs)

17:12.760 --> 17:14.739
(Demelza laughs)

17:21.520 --> 17:24.500
DRAKE: So, we thought Easter week.

17:24.680 --> 17:27.103
- In haste, are we?
- Not at all, sur.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.419
- My Rosie be a fitty maid.
- Yes, sur.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.659
Handy with a needle and thread.

17:32.840 --> 17:35.263
By rights I should be recompensed.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.658
Is not a well-matched daughter recompense?

17:37.840 --> 17:42.106
Look, how if I offer'd to mend
all thy tools free of charge?

17:42.280 --> 17:44.225
Oh! So it's bribery now?

17:44.400 --> 17:47.221
- Father...
- My brother Tom warned me of thee!

17:47.400 --> 17:48.469
Swim ’ what’?

17:48.640 --> 17:51.302
What a sneavy, snivey I'il worm 'ee be!

17:52.800 --> 17:57.499
Rosina. You an' I talk over arrangements
for the wedding breakfast.

17:57.680 --> 18:01.343
She'll not find a truer,
honester man than my brother.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.908
Amen to that!

18:04.000 --> 18:05.945
(Birdsong)

18:06.120 --> 18:10.261
How the joy of resuming one's conjugal duty

18:10.440 --> 18:13.898
pales beside the pleasure of the act itself.

18:17.320 --> 18:19.459
Is it not a blessing...

18:19.640 --> 18:22.507
to know we are about
God's holy work?

18:24.200 --> 18:25.861
Mm.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.427
(Door opens and closes)

18:36.600 --> 18:37.942
BASSET: A poorhouse?

18:38.120 --> 18:40.497
To my shame,
I've never set foot inside one.

18:40.680 --> 18:43.319
I wish every member of this House
could do so.

18:43.480 --> 18:45.857
They would soon see
why men would rather starve

18:46.040 --> 18:48.258
than commit themselves
to such a degrading Institution.

18:48.440 --> 18:50.897
- But if people lack employment...
- Many do not.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.583
They only lack the sufficiency
to meet the price of bread.

18:53.760 --> 18:55.739
And Parliament lacks the will
to remedy that.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.103
Perhaps there is no remedy.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.862
Perhaps I should throw up my hands
and go home.

19:12.880 --> 19:17.226
Is that new?
How can we afford such fine things?

19:18.920 --> 19:20.421
How do you think, my love?

19:20.600 --> 19:23.262
Every week,
I save a few pence of your earnings

19:23.440 --> 19:26.705
so that we may allow ourselves
these little indulgences.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.784
- You're too good for me, Rowella.
- (Chuckles)

19:34.880 --> 19:37.383
Every day I think to marry such a goddess.

19:37.760 --> 19:41.867
You are Artemis...Athena...Aphrodite.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.860
My love, your mother and sisters.

19:44.040 --> 19:46.224
So kind, always thinking of others.

19:46.400 --> 19:49.426
Give them my love.
Tell them I will visit next week.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.626
(Door opens and closes)

20:03.760 --> 20:05.899
Goddess Fortune is against you.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.059
(Chatter)

20:11.080 --> 20:13.423
CROUPIER: Players, take your chances.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.064
(Chatter and laughter)

20:24.840 --> 20:26.546
CROUPIER: No more wagers.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.426
Come to try your luck, sir?

20:28.600 --> 20:31.262
You have a reckless streak?

20:31.440 --> 20:33.226
Only with my own money.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.459
(Giggles)

20:40.840 --> 20:43.149
- Dr Enys?
- Oh, Mr Solway.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.379
Your sisters have the ague.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.061
It's nothing to be concerned about,

20:47.240 --> 20:49.379
but they are resting
and should not be disturbed.

20:49.560 --> 20:52.017
I thank you, sir.
I'll visit them tomorrow.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.624
CROUPIER: The house wins.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.700
I really am quite hopeless.
Should I quit the field?

21:03.880 --> 21:07.020
Well, that seems a pity,
when it affords you such pleasure.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.260
- Interesting advice.
- Entirely dis-interested!

21:10.440 --> 21:13.261
Having nothing to lose,
I have nothing to gain.

21:13.440 --> 21:18.264
How often we see those with "nothing to lose"
assisting others to lose all they have.

21:18.440 --> 21:20.783
CROUPIER: No more wagers.

21:21.960 --> 21:24.542
- (Clattering and gasps of shock)
MAN: Damn it, sir!

21:24.720 --> 21:27.382
You will pay me in full
or give me satisfaction!

21:27.560 --> 21:29.346
Do I make myself clear, Poldark?

21:29.520 --> 21:32.500
- Are these gentlemen annoying you?
- Who the devil are you?

21:33.320 --> 21:35.060
- (Gasps of shock)
- Aaargh!

21:35.240 --> 21:36.901
- Interesting manoeuvre.
- (Groans)

21:37.080 --> 21:40.982
Not one I'd recommend
after two bottles of port.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.227
I don't believe we've been introduced.

21:44.400 --> 21:49.019
The Honourable Jasper lnchcliffe.
And I am Viscount Bollington.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.588
- (lnchcliffe groans)
- Oh...

21:50.760 --> 21:54.947
I have the honour of being acquainted
with both your fathers.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.702
At Westminster.

21:57.880 --> 22:02.021
So, how may we resolve this
to everyone's satisfaction?

22:03.600 --> 22:05.579
(Murmurs of disgust)

22:15.880 --> 22:17.859
(Lock rattles)

22:40.400 --> 22:42.379
(Latch clicks, gate squeaks)

22:48.400 --> 22:50.379
(indistinct voices)

22:51.840 --> 22:53.819
OSSIE: Oh, God, Rowella!

22:56.320 --> 22:57.423
OSSIE: Oh!

23:01.600 --> 23:03.579
(Panﬁng)

23:07.120 --> 23:08.906
(Ossie grunts)

23:11.400 --> 23:13.379
(Ossie chuckles and moans)

23:18.560 --> 23:20.539
(Breathes heavily)

23:27.560 --> 23:29.744
CROUPIER:
Players, take your chances, please.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.867
(Water splashes)

23:33.040 --> 23:36.020
I hope this will recompense you
for your trouble.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.542
No trouble at all, sir.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.301
Truth be told, it's why I work here.

23:39.480 --> 23:42.904
There's always some gent paying me
to swab up after their relations!

23:43.080 --> 23:45.219
Were it not for that,
I'd never make ends meet.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.186
ROSS: Huh.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.979
(Exhales heavily)

24:02.760 --> 24:04.546
Do I look dreadful?

24:06.960 --> 24:08.348
Good night.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.260
- Ross? _
- A fortunate misunderstanding.

24:22.440 --> 24:25.944
- Fortunate?
- In that I was the target, not Geoffrey Charles.

24:26.120 --> 24:28.987
- Where is he?
- Returned to Harrow.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.221
Lesson learnt.

24:31.400 --> 24:34.858
- Are you quite sure he was gambling?
- I myself discharged the debt.

24:35.040 --> 24:38.783
- I must repay you.
- It's the least I can do for my nephew.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.021
- (Continues pouring drinks)
- Hm.

24:50.360 --> 24:52.464
Ross, do you suppose...

24:52.640 --> 24:54.221
Will this become a habit?

24:54.400 --> 24:56.379
- Is he like...
- Like his father?

24:57.160 --> 24:58.627
I hope so.

24:58.800 --> 25:01.985
For a truer, more generous heart
would be hard to find.

25:02.160 --> 25:04.867
- I shall write and reprimand him.
- No, do not.

25:05.040 --> 25:08.624
If he thinks I've informed on him,
he will no longer trust me.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.382
- IfI can keep an eye on him...
- That role should fall to George.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.744
We both know he would not want it.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.899
Nor would Geoffrey Charles.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.661
I'm obliged to you, Ross.

25:20.520 --> 25:24.217
And I agree, Geoffrey Charles
does not need to be told of our meeting.

25:24.400 --> 25:28.029
- Any more than George does.
- Then the subject is closed.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.139
R055: My o'earest Demelza.

25:43.320 --> 25:46.619
Thoughts of you console me
and holster my resolve

25:46.800 --> 25:48.779
against the challenges of the House,

25:48.960 --> 25:51.337
where .7 find I have few allies.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.221
I have
a
scheme in mind
but doubt it wﬂl be well received.

25:57.920 --> 26:01.139
Yet all the wh/le the food shortages continue.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.185
My dearest Ross,

26:13.200 --> 26:15.760
our fortunes here are yet to Impro ve.

26:16.680 --> 26:19.820
In Saw/e the fever carried oﬁr
three young /Vanfans.

26:20.800 --> 26:24.224
Dw/ght could do nothing,
for they were weak with starvation.

26:31.080 --> 26:36.620
The loss of innocent lives
makes me feel more keen/y our own loss.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.384
And the distance between us.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.019
You seem very far away.

26:51.160 --> 26:52.661
Where are you?

26:53.720 --> 26:56.666
Nampara.
Thinking of my daughter.

26:56.840 --> 26:59.149
- Dear Clowance.
- No.

26:59.320 --> 27:01.538
No. Julia.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.142
Oh, forgive me, I have no wish to intrude.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.584
Did I tell you how she died in my arms?

27:10.320 --> 27:15.189
How I watched her...
take her last breath?

27:19.720 --> 27:22.700
I could not conceive
how the life could go out of her...

27:23.760 --> 27:28.424
...when the day before,
I'd...danced her on my knee.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.819
We are taught to be strong...

27:35.360 --> 27:37.339
...to betray no weakness, but...

27:38.280 --> 27:42.944
...that night I learnt...
to be strong is weakness.

27:46.560 --> 27:48.699
Pain should not be avoided.

27:56.960 --> 27:59.144
Tears must fall.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.859
(Stifles a sob)

28:22.880 --> 28:25.860
- (Birdsong)
- (Bell tolling)

28:27.760 --> 28:28.977
(Exhales)

28:29.880 --> 28:32.986
(Exhales contentedly)

28:36.800 --> 28:38.859
I shall visit Nat Pearce today.

28:40.080 --> 28:42.822
Extraordinary how he lingers on.

28:47.480 --> 28:51.746
Extraordinary too that you find
not the smallest pleasure in our congress.

28:53.120 --> 28:55.020
Quite...

28:55.200 --> 28:57.179
baffling.

29:04.920 --> 29:07.297
God's blessing be upon you!

29:14.680 --> 29:16.989
You'll need them where you're going.

29:17.800 --> 29:21.702
Yet...l must thank you for lingering on.

29:22.680 --> 29:28.789
My visits here have provided the perfect cover
for me to service my ardent young sister-in-law.

29:30.240 --> 29:35.257
Of course, now that I've prevailed
upon my wife to resume her...duties,

29:35.440 --> 29:37.624
I'll no longer require those services.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.382
So today will be the last time
I visit either of you.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.940
And may I cheerfully say,

29:44.120 --> 29:46.623
the devil take you both!

29:47.160 --> 29:48.627
(Chuckles)

29:50.200 --> 29:53.385
And you, sir.

30:00.240 --> 30:01.901
(Door slams)

30:02.080 --> 30:05.299
I've been thinking on this.
Suppose you're a waiter.

30:05.480 --> 30:07.300
You earn a pittance.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.745
But...with my small gratuity,
and that of others like me,

30:10.920 --> 30:13.138
you go some way towards
making ends meet.

30:13.320 --> 30:14.389
Yes?

30:14.560 --> 30:18.621
- Thus saving yourself from the poorhouse.
- And?

30:18.800 --> 30:21.587
Thus saving the state
from having to pay out even more,

30:21.760 --> 30:23.864
to fund an institution
which everyone hates.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.702
- In other words...
- Help the workers to keep working...

30:26.880 --> 30:28.859
By helping them to eat.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.981
Oh, Vicar, did I mention
the roof has begun to leak?

30:36.160 --> 30:37.229
Good to know.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.743
It must be why Arthur's been laid so low -

30:39.920 --> 30:42.377
shivering and weeping in his bed all week.

30:43.040 --> 30:46.225
- But repairs are so expensive.
- However will you manage?

30:46.400 --> 30:50.666
- Well, I was hoping...
- Blessed are they who live in hope.

30:50.840 --> 30:53.343
For they shall receive God's benison.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.464
Go forth, saith the Lord,

30:56.640 --> 30:58.858
and count thy blessings.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.785
For you have had the last of 'em!

31:01.960 --> 31:04.781
(Door opens and closes)

31:08.600 --> 31:11.103
I never thought I'd see you smile again.

31:11.280 --> 31:13.840
'Tis not something comes easy, even now.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.265
Then you must practise more!
For tomorrow you're to be wed.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.817
And, in time, like Ross an' me...

31:20.000 --> 31:23.185
- Love may grow?
- Love will grow.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.977
(Ossie humming cheerfully)

31:32.200 --> 31:34.179
(Owl hoots)

31:40.240 --> 31:42.219
(Continues humming)

31:43.960 --> 31:45.143
(Rustling)

31:45.320 --> 31:47.106
(Horse whinnies)

31:47.280 --> 31:49.066
Mr Reverend Whitworth?

31:49.240 --> 31:51.663
Yes? Who is it?

31:51.840 --> 31:53.660
What do you want?

31:53.840 --> 31:55.819
This is what I want.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.781
(Grunts)

31:57.960 --> 31:59.666
(Grunting)

31:59.840 --> 32:01.262
(Horse whinnies)

32:02.360 --> 32:03.827
Aaargh!

32:04.000 --> 32:05.786
(Grunting)

32:07.360 --> 32:09.260
Yéu!
(Grunts)

32:10.960 --> 32:13.064
(Horse whinnies)

32:13.240 --> 32:14.980
(Ossie cries out)

32:15.160 --> 32:16.821
(Ossie gasps)

32:17.000 --> 32:18.979
(Ossie shrieks)

32:29.880 --> 32:31.939
You're later than usual.

32:32.120 --> 32:33.985
Were your sisters well?

32:38.080 --> 32:40.059
Arthur?

32:40.800 --> 32:42.779
(Gasps softly)

33:16.960 --> 33:18.097
(Gasps)

33:46.560 --> 33:48.539
(Dull roar of waves)

33:59.080 --> 34:01.059
(Low chatter)

34:18.040 --> 34:20.019
(Birds chirruping)

34:24.120 --> 34:26.099
(Knocks on door)

34:50.880 --> 34:52.666
(Chatter)

35:11.280 --> 35:13.066
Dead?

35:29.200 --> 35:33.660
She's out in the meadow flower-gathering

35:34.760 --> 35:39.220
In the merry morning of May

35:46.000 --> 35:47.979
Why tell me, sister?

35:48.880 --> 35:52.509
Why not keep me in the dark
an' let me wed that sweet, sweet girl?

35:52.680 --> 35:56.059
Oh, Drake. You know why.

36:02.560 --> 36:04.539
(Drake sobs)

36:13.280 --> 36:15.259
This was no accident.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.226
I cannot tell you, ma'am.
I was not there.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.777
No, I am telling you.

36:19.960 --> 36:22.463
These lacerations and bruises...

36:22.640 --> 36:25.200
Are consistent with a fall
and the headlong bolt of a horse.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.737
For which he could not possibly be at fault.

36:28.800 --> 36:32.179
My son was an excellent horseman.
Did he not ride to hounds?

36:34.360 --> 36:39.297
But clearly someone is to blame,
and I will not rest till I discover who it is.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.299
(Laughter and chatter)

37:03.120 --> 37:06.146
I went to the smithy, but found no sign of 'im.

37:07.480 --> 37:10.506
- Zacky see'd him with Rosina.
- (Sighs)

37:10.680 --> 37:12.545
Then he left. None knows where.

37:12.720 --> 37:15.177
(Sighs) Judas, Sam...

37:15.800 --> 37:18.826
Should I have told him?
Should I first have let him wed Rosina?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.262
Yes!

37:20.440 --> 37:22.897
For she'd have made him
a good an' proper wife.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.105
And they'd have grown happy
an' served Christ together.

37:25.280 --> 37:27.259
Yes.

37:28.200 --> 37:30.464
But then he'd never have forgiven me.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.659
(Baby gn'zz/es)

38:00.040 --> 38:02.019
(Baby grizzles)

38:25.600 --> 38:27.386
Demelza?

38:31.080 --> 38:33.867
- Drake's gone.
- And Rosina?

38:34.040 --> 38:35.940
Rosina's brave. Jacka's raging.

38:36.120 --> 38:38.224
- As is half the village.
- I don't wonder.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.719
To jilt a girl on her wedding day?

38:39.880 --> 38:41.905
Oh, Dwight. What shall I do?

38:42.080 --> 38:44.139
I'm that weary of keepin' the peace...

38:45.760 --> 38:47.785
I just wish somebody would take care of me!

38:47.960 --> 38:49.666
Yes.

38:49.840 --> 38:51.262
Ross should be here.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.059
And Caroline.

39:02.520 --> 39:05.899
So first you torment me
and then you abandon me?

39:06.080 --> 39:08.059
Return with me to Cornwall.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.061
Sir Francis has room in his carriage.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.344
We will have the swiftest possible journey.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.580
Dwight would not thank me
for returning with my demons still intact.

39:16.760 --> 39:20.787
You know very well he would embrace you,
demons and all.

39:24.080 --> 39:26.059
(Clock chiming)

39:27.800 --> 39:30.701
I did not weep. Could not.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.360
Even when Sarah grew cold in my arms.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.989
I thought, if I could only keep hold of her...

39:42.120 --> 39:44.099
...I could will her back to life.

39:47.160 --> 39:50.425
When Dwight finally prised her from me,
the agony was...

39:52.120 --> 39:54.099
...so overwhelming.

39:58.600 --> 40:03.424
I had to remove myself from even
the possibility of ever feeling that again.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.545
By coming to London.

40:05.720 --> 40:09.224
You know, there's nowhere like London
for numbing the senses.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.425
Is that what you desire?

40:12.120 --> 40:13.303
Still?

40:14.560 --> 40:16.539
For now.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.666
But I have begun to weep, Ross.

40:24.360 --> 40:26.339
And I will do so again.

40:31.400 --> 40:34.039
If you're hungry, help yourself.

40:34.200 --> 40:36.464
Here, take some bread.

40:36.640 --> 40:40.269
Ha_! Mistress or no...
Don't 'ee think 'ee Will buy our favour!

40:40.440 --> 40:43.580
Whenever he shows his face,
brother of yours'll pay for what he done!

40:43.760 --> 40:45.819
- Here.
- Hm.

40:52.400 --> 40:55.699
ROWELLA: It's unfortunate
we cannot attend the funeral.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.939
- I will write to my sister...
- (Winces)

40:58.120 --> 41:00.463
...commiserating with her
on the terrible news.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.584
Some people think it was murder.

41:06.720 --> 41:08.221
Do they?

41:08.400 --> 41:12.177
But if that were the case,
would not a weapon have been found?

41:23.760 --> 41:25.739
(Bell tolling)

41:26.200 --> 41:28.179
(Low chatter)

41:29.520 --> 41:32.660
True, yes.
Plans have been made.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.960
I shall take charge of John Conan.

41:36.520 --> 41:40.183
As my grandson and heir,
he will be properly educated.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.305
His mother is wholly incapable.

41:42.480 --> 41:44.744
No wonder Osborne despaired of her.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.301
(Gasps of shock)

41:50.080 --> 41:53.982
Miss Cane, fetch the smelling salts.
Mrs Whitworth has fainted.

41:54.160 --> 41:56.139
Morwenna?

42:31.720 --> 42:34.541
GEORGE: Sincere condolences.

42:34.720 --> 42:37.746
You must feel the loss keenly.

42:37.920 --> 42:39.899
I feel nothing.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.379
But relief.

42:43.560 --> 42:47.337
I loathed him with every bone in my body.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.818
He sought to have me committed.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.379
He took away my son.

42:57.680 --> 42:59.989
He violated me...

43:00.160 --> 43:02.139
again and again...

43:03.680 --> 43:05.420
...and again.

43:09.400 --> 43:11.379
L...did not know.

43:13.280 --> 43:15.840
We...could not possibly have known, cousin.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.060
Our only thought was to provide
you with an advantageous match...

43:19.240 --> 43:21.105
Advantageous to whom?

43:25.360 --> 43:26.941
(Clears his throat)

43:52.320 --> 43:54.299
He's gone.

43:56.080 --> 43:58.059
But where?

44:08.640 --> 44:10.619
(Birdsong)

44:12.480 --> 44:14.459
(Door being unlocked)

44:20.960 --> 44:22.621
Morwenna.

44:22.800 --> 44:24.506
- Do not... No...
- What is it?

44:24.680 --> 44:26.147
Please.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.060
- Leave me. Go away.
- I had to come.

44:28.240 --> 44:31.903
I've been sleeping rough.
I know I don't look seemly.

44:32.080 --> 44:33.786
- I beg you to excuse that.
- I cannot.

44:33.960 --> 44:35.621
(Gasps) I cannot bear it.

44:35.800 --> 44:39.099
If it too soon...
I can come again tomorrow.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.501
- Just tell me what...
- Never...

44:41.680 --> 44:43.102
What?

44:47.200 --> 44:49.179
I'm sick.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.104
Tainted.

44:53.760 --> 44:56.547
It's done with. Ended.

44:57.960 --> 44:59.939
Please, leave me now
and never come back.

45:00.120 --> 45:03.305
No, Morwenna, we can't part like this.

45:06.760 --> 45:08.899
Who is this person, Morwenna?

45:10.280 --> 45:12.259
Beggin' yer pardon, ma'am.

45:14.200 --> 45:17.977
I'm...a friend, a well-wisher.

45:18.880 --> 45:21.189
- I come to inquire...
- Go inside, Morvvenna.

45:21.360 --> 45:24.067
- So, please you, ma'am.
- Elliot? Clegg?

45:24.240 --> 45:26.105
- Mon/venna.
- Horsewhip this person,

45:26.280 --> 45:28.737
then remove him from the premises.

45:35.720 --> 45:37.301
(Gate squeaks)

45:37.480 --> 45:40.984
Drake Came was found lurking
outside the vicarage?

45:41.160 --> 45:43.219
Osborne's death
may not be an aCCIdent after all.

45:43.400 --> 45:46.062
- You surely don't suggest...
- Where is Harry?

45:48.480 --> 45:50.459
(Cockerel crows)

45:52.240 --> 45:54.424
Should we not send for Cap'n Ross?

45:54.600 --> 45:58.377
He have London matters to attend to.
Besides, what could he do here?

45:58.560 --> 46:01.745
Well, 'tis 'oped the thing
will blow over soon enough.

46:02.840 --> 46:05.786
- An' no harm done.
- (Firm knocking on door)

46:12.080 --> 46:15.060
Mr Warleggan did send me in 'is stead.

46:15.240 --> 46:18.744
Thy little brother is wanted.
I have orders to search the house.

46:18.920 --> 46:21.480
(Scoffs) George Warleggan
don't give orders here.

46:21.640 --> 46:24.143
I do.
An' you'll not set foot across this threshold.

46:24.320 --> 46:26.299
Care to wager that, missus?

46:29.120 --> 46:31.099
Aaargh! Urgh!

46:31.560 --> 46:33.300
- (Demelza grunts)
-Umm

46:33.480 --> 46:34.981
(Exhales heavily)

46:35.160 --> 46:37.469
(He bangs on door) Hey! Hey!

46:44.640 --> 46:46.904
Lunch at Ashbourne
or shall we press on?

46:47.080 --> 46:48.820
The latter.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.424
If we're to succeed with this,
the sooner we put forward the scheme...

46:52.600 --> 46:55.865
You will, of course,
require Lord Falmouth's agreement.

46:57.720 --> 47:01.099
As foremost landowner in the district,
nothing will pass without him.

47:11.160 --> 47:14.106
What proof had you that they were?
Or that Drake Came is a felon?

47:14.280 --> 47:17.864
- You go too far, George!
- My dear, I merely wish to see justice done.

47:18.040 --> 47:21.498
For whose benefit? Morwenna's?
You heard her. She is glad Osborne is dead!

47:21.680 --> 47:23.420
- Nonetheless...
- George!

47:23.600 --> 47:25.625
The man was a monster.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.779
And we forced her to wed him.

47:28.560 --> 47:30.187
- If you value my love...
- You know I do!

47:30.360 --> 47:32.544
Do not pursue Drake Came.

47:38.520 --> 47:40.499
As you wish, my dear.

47:49.200 --> 47:51.179
(Harry Harry clears his throat)

47:52.360 --> 47:55.420
(Raised voice)
We will call off the search for Drake Carne.

47:55.600 --> 47:56.942
Yes, sur.

47:57.680 --> 47:59.784
There will be other ways to punish him.

48:05.280 --> 48:08.943
HARRY HARRY: Sithee, Jacka, 'twas a terrible
thing young Came did to thy daughter!

48:09.120 --> 48:12.704
JACKA: Don't I know it!
- Last time Tom let 'im wriggle off the hook.

48:12.880 --> 48:14.859
This time we'll do a proper job.

48:20.040 --> 48:21.860
(Fire roaring)

48:30.600 --> 48:33.706
Dear God!
It gets worser and worse.

48:35.840 --> 48:37.546
What can we do?

48:38.600 --> 48:41.421
Pray for forgiveness, for sins and sinners.

48:41.600 --> 48:46.503
Why? Is it a sin to seek happiness
for ourselves and others?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.139
Only our merciful Father knows that.

48:50.320 --> 48:51.821
Do he?

48:52.000 --> 48:55.379
Sometimes it do feel like
he don't think about happiness at all.

48:55.960 --> 48:59.305
ROSINA:
What a wicked thing to have happened.

48:59.480 --> 49:01.459
I can't think 'twas an accident.

49:01.640 --> 49:03.619
Nor we, maid.

49:05.280 --> 49:06.861
Rosina.

49:07.040 --> 49:10.703
When Drake came to you, did he...
he tell you where he was going?

49:10.880 --> 49:12.268
No, ma'am.

49:13.320 --> 49:17.939
Only what had happened an' that he had to go
because of what he called his "prior love".

49:21.280 --> 49:23.100
Rosina, I'm that sorry.

49:23.280 --> 49:26.386
To think, if it had happened only an hour later,
we'd be wed now.

49:27.920 --> 49:30.104
And I know he'd never have left me.

49:47.680 --> 49:49.580
So, if I understand you correctly:

49:49.760 --> 49:53.787
after a year in which you
have not once voted as I directed...

49:53.960 --> 49:57.305
and ignored my proposal
for a road through St Day,

49:57.480 --> 50:00.426
you now come to me, seeking my support
for a proposal of your own?

50:00.600 --> 50:04.548
Which will cost me dear
and deliver me nothing in return?

50:13.920 --> 50:15.899
(Drake sobs)

50:17.880 --> 50:19.381
SAM: Oh, praise God.

50:19.560 --> 50:22.859
Oh, we've been waitin' here,
prayin' for 'ee to come home.

50:23.040 --> 50:25.258
- Pay no heed to this, brother.
- She's changed.

50:26.800 --> 50:29.906
She don't want me. _
She won't see me ever again.

50:32.280 --> 50:34.703
- Hey. It's all right. It's all right.
- (Sobs)

50:34.880 --> 50:37.257
Brother, Sam will take you home with him.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.459
Ross!

51:24.560 --> 51:26.539
(Birdsong)

51:37.960 --> 51:40.383
DEMELZA: I wish the world would go away.

51:43.160 --> 51:45.139
What world?

51:50.040 --> 51:53.020
- Promise me you won't go after George.
- (He exhales)

51:53.200 --> 51:55.703
I couldn't bear to have
the feud stoked up again.

51:56.880 --> 51:58.745
I'll let it pass this once.

52:00.040 --> 52:02.543
- For your sake.
- Oh, not for yours?

52:03.400 --> 52:06.460
Will you not need his consent
for your scheme today?

52:06.640 --> 52:08.585
Which he'll refuse on principle.

52:09.520 --> 52:11.545
So 'twill be a wasted journey.

52:13.840 --> 52:15.819
Not entirely.

52:24.280 --> 52:30.981
So, in short, I propose a means-tested,
sliding-scale of wage supplements

52:31.160 --> 52:34.982
in order to mitigate the worst effects
of the current food crisis.

52:35.160 --> 52:40.427
And by doing so we can keep our mines
and our mills working and our workers fed.

52:40.600 --> 52:44.821
- And the cost of all this?
- Would fall on the landowners of this parish.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.377
- We who are assembled here today.
- (Murmuring)

52:48.320 --> 52:52.939
And where, pray, is the incentive to work,
if one pays people to be idle?

52:53.120 --> 52:55.429
- I believe, sir, you misunderstand the principle.
- Do I?

52:55.600 --> 52:58.740
The assistance is temporary -
while the price of grain is prohibitive,

52:58.920 --> 53:02.139
to enable people to live and not die.

53:02.320 --> 53:05.505
Another solution would be _ _
for the grain merchants to lower their prices.

53:05.680 --> 53:08.501
Why should they? Do they not have
a living to make as well as anyone else?

53:08.680 --> 53:10.739
Speaking for myself,
I have no capital to spare.

53:10.920 --> 53:12.865
Because you've spent it
on buying up a borough.

53:13.040 --> 53:15.417
Besides, if the scheme is to work,
surely it's only fair

53:15.600 --> 53:17.704
that all landowners in the district participate?

53:17.880 --> 53:20.440
Where is Lord Falmouth?

53:20.600 --> 53:23.182
If he is not willing,
why should anyone else be?

53:26.200 --> 53:28.179
Well, I suggest we take a vote.

53:28.600 --> 53:30.579
Those in favour?

53:36.000 --> 53:37.979
And those against?

53:38.160 --> 53:41.300
- Since there's no clear majority...
- I rather think there is.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.680
I believe I'm just in time to cast my vote.

53:50.800 --> 53:52.779
(Lively chatter)

53:53.640 --> 53:57.269
The bill I have in mind
has a particular place in my heart.

53:57.440 --> 53:59.817
Were the road in question to be built,

54:00.000 --> 54:02.901
it would considerably aid my scheme
to clear the hovels of St Day

54:03.080 --> 54:05.947
and build in their place
an extension to my estate.

54:06.120 --> 54:08.907
And the hovels of St Day?

54:09.080 --> 54:11.059
Specifically, their inhabitants?

54:14.400 --> 54:16.061
They will be rehoused.

54:18.680 --> 54:20.068
At my expense.

54:22.640 --> 54:24.619
You have my word.

54:26.160 --> 54:28.025
You have my vote.

54:28.200 --> 54:29.906
As you have had mine.

55:36.920 --> 55:40.378
- I wish I could stay longer.
- You did what you came to do.

55:41.160 --> 55:43.139
Now you must tell Westminster.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.979
If it will listen.

55:48.200 --> 55:50.179
Make it listen.

56:19.800 --> 56:22.667
So, I propose

56:22.840 --> 56:25.866
that this new system of Poor Relief-

56:26.040 --> 56:28.827
devised in my own constituency,

56:29.000 --> 56:34.017
implemented with great success -
should be adopted nationally.

56:34.200 --> 56:36.839
So that health, welfare, and maintenance

56:37.000 --> 56:40.777
become the birth right not of the few,
but of all!

56:40.960 --> 56:42.780
(Shouting and some heckling)

56:44.200 --> 56:47.180
Have the Honourable Member
for Truro call on me.

56:47.360 --> 56:49.624
He has some interesting things to say.
