WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:03.003
HURRICANE MARY IS DUE
TO HIT TOMORROW

00:03.003 --> 00:04.335
WITH STRONG WINDS
AND HEAVY RAIN.

00:04.335 --> 00:07.138
OH, MY GOD.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

00:07.138 --> 00:09.340
POWER OUTAGES,
TREES FALLING, FLOODS.

00:09.340 --> 00:11.011
NO. HURRICANE PARTY,

00:11.011 --> 00:13.614
MY HOUSE, TOMORROW!
TELL EVERYONE.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.386
(dings)
HEY, EVERYONE!

00:15.386 --> 00:16.447
(clenched teeth)
EVERYONE I LIKE.

00:16.447 --> 00:18.619
NEVER MIND!
BUT IT IS CLOSING TIME.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.192
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO HOME,
BUT YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.

00:21.192 --> 00:22.193
BAM!

00:22.193 --> 00:25.796
OH. I JUST NEED
ONE MORE GLASS OF CAB.

00:25.796 --> 00:28.359
THAT'S ACTUALLY ILLEGAL FOR ME
TO SELL AFTER I CLOSE.
(pours wine)

00:28.359 --> 00:30.030
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT PAYING
FOR IT.
(clatters)

00:30.030 --> 00:33.204
I LOVE HURRICANES.
THEY'RE LIKE ADULT SNOW DAYS.

00:33.204 --> 00:34.765
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GO TO WORK.

00:34.765 --> 00:36.807
YOU DRINK AND PLAY GAMES.

00:36.807 --> 00:38.169
SO IT'S LIKE EVERY DAY
FOR US.
(wine pours)

00:38.169 --> 00:39.540
BUT WITH WIND.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.372
OH, BROTHER.
(chuckles)

00:41.372 --> 00:43.414
(imitates wind blowing)
MM. OH.

00:43.414 --> 00:48.219
в™Єв™Єв™Є

00:48.219 --> 00:50.251
(wind howling)
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

00:50.251 --> 00:54.155
WELL, I GOTTA PROTECT
MY HANGOUT SPOT.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.826
I DIDN'T THINK THIS THROUGH!

00:55.826 --> 00:58.389
SHOULD--
SHOULD I JUST COME INSIDE?!

00:58.389 --> 01:00.191
CAN'T REALLY HEAR YOU.
(chuckles)

01:00.191 --> 01:02.163
THAT'S WEIRD!
I CAN HEAR YOU PERFECTLY!

01:02.163 --> 01:05.496
(speaks indistinctly
in muffled voice)

01:05.496 --> 01:06.697
(door opens)
NICE COVER.

01:06.697 --> 01:09.100
(door closes)
WOW. HURRICANE MARY? (laughs)

01:09.100 --> 01:11.071
MORE LIKE HURRICANE SCARY.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.573
(laughs)

01:12.573 --> 01:14.575
OH, WHERE'S MY BABY GIRL?

01:14.575 --> 01:16.147
SHE'S AT GRAYSON'S
WITH THE GUYS.

01:16.147 --> 01:18.309
(crunches)
MM. JULES, THIS APPLE--

01:18.309 --> 01:19.580
IT'S TOO HARD.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.352
SHE'S AT GRAYSON'S
WITH THE GUYS.

01:21.352 --> 01:26.687
SORRY! I AM JUST TOO ANGRY
TO TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW, WADE!

01:26.687 --> 01:30.861
OHH! HE RE-ENLISTED!
HE'S GONNA BE OVERSEAS

01:30.861 --> 01:32.763
FOR A WHOLE OTHER YEAR.

01:32.763 --> 01:35.526
I THOUGHT THAT
WE WERE REALLY GETTING SERIOUS.

01:35.526 --> 01:37.198
OF ALL THE RELATIONSHIPS
OF PEOPLE

01:37.198 --> 01:39.600
WHO HAVE NEVER MET EACH OTHER,
I REALLY BELIEVED IN THIS ONE.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.873
RELATIONSHIPS ARE HARD,
LIKE APPLES.

01:42.873 --> 01:45.636
(gags) PRETTY SURE
I SWALLOWED THE STICKER.

01:45.636 --> 01:48.309
AH.
SERIOUSLY, I CAN HEAR YOU
CLEAR AS DAY!

01:48.309 --> 01:50.541
(whispers)
SHH, SHH. GUYS, DON'T.

01:50.541 --> 01:53.784
I'M GONNA GO TAKE
A LONG, SAD BATH.

01:53.784 --> 01:56.217
THERE GOES THAT LOOFAH.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.648
LAURIE SHOULD DATE YOU, TRAV.

01:57.648 --> 01:58.889
WHAT?
WHEN WE MADE OUT,

01:58.889 --> 02:00.791
HE WAS SUPER CLASSY.

02:00.791 --> 02:03.794
YOU KNOW, MOST GUYS JUST GO,
LIKE, STRAIGHT FOR THE TATERS,

02:03.794 --> 02:06.126
BUT, MNH-MNH, NOT THIS ONE.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.228
THAT'S THE WAY I RAISED HIM.
(chuckles)

02:07.228 --> 02:08.459
"TATERS ARE FOR LATERS."

02:08.459 --> 02:10.130
SHE ACTUALLY DID SAY THAT.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.262
I DID.
BUT, YOU KNOW,

02:11.262 --> 02:12.803
LAURIE DOESN'T REALLY SEE ME
LIKE THAT.

02:12.803 --> 02:15.236
NO! YOU ARE IN THE GAME NOW.

02:15.236 --> 02:18.309
ONCE ANYONE IN OUR PACK
OF FRIENDS HOOKS UP WITH A DUDE,

02:18.309 --> 02:21.642
HE IS PACK PROPERTY.
(cell phone rings)

02:21.642 --> 02:23.143
MM.
YOU HEAR THAT?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.775
I'M IN THE GAME.

02:24.775 --> 02:27.378
WAY TO GO, BUDDY. (chuckles)
(door opens and closes)

02:27.378 --> 02:30.421
ELLIE.
MEETING. GRAYSON'S. NOW.

02:30.421 --> 02:34.154
(panting) OH, GOD.
(thunder crashing)

02:34.154 --> 02:35.155
(door closes)

02:35.155 --> 02:37.928
TRAVIS GOT LAURIE PREGNANT.

02:37.928 --> 02:39.690
(Bobby and Andy) WHAT?!
MAYBE I TOOK A FEW STEPS AHEAD,

02:39.690 --> 02:42.193
BUT STILL,
IT WOULD BE SO HORRIBLE

02:42.193 --> 02:43.594
IF THOSE TWO HOOKED UP.
(thunder rumbling)

02:43.594 --> 02:46.497
REALLY? MAN, I THINK
IT WOULD BE GREAT.

02:46.497 --> 02:48.669
(sighs)

02:48.669 --> 02:50.341
(clenched teeth)
IS SHE STARING AT ME?

02:50.341 --> 02:51.742
(clenched teeth) YEAH.
HANDS ON HIPS?

02:51.742 --> 02:53.204
UH-HUH.
JAW CLENCHED?

02:53.204 --> 02:54.205
YOU KNOW IT.
HEAD TIPPED TO THE--

02:54.205 --> 02:55.846
OH, JUST LOOK AT HER!

02:55.846 --> 02:57.848
OH, TRAVIS.

02:57.848 --> 03:00.511
WHAT AM I DOING
WAITING AROUND FOR A GUY

03:00.511 --> 03:03.714
THAT I'VE NEVER EVEN
HELD HANDS WITH OR KISSED

03:03.714 --> 03:07.958
OR BURNT WITH A MATCH?

03:07.958 --> 03:09.920
I THINK
THAT WADE AND I ARE DONE.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.662
I'M SORRY.

03:11.662 --> 03:13.524
THANKS, TRAVIS.

03:13.524 --> 03:17.698
OHH. I WISH THERE WERE
MORE GUYS LIKE YOU AROUND.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.531
(Tom) DUDE, YOU'RE IN.

03:22.433 --> 03:24.535
HOW COULD YOU BE OKAY
WITH TRAV DATING LAURIE?

03:24.535 --> 03:26.377
HE'S--HE'S JUST A KID.

03:26.377 --> 03:28.579
PLUS SHE SLEPT
WITH YOUR FIANCE.

03:28.579 --> 03:30.210
OW! WH-WHY?

03:30.210 --> 03:31.211
SLEEPING WITH LAURIE.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.384
OH. I'LL ALLOW IT.

03:33.384 --> 03:36.317
LAURIE ROCKS.
PLUS IT'D MAKE TRAVIS HAPPY,

03:36.317 --> 03:38.719
AND THAT'S OKAY BY ME.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.421
THE AGE DIFFERENCE
IS TOO BIG.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.922
(sighs)
YOU CAN'T STOP LOVE.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.424
ELLIE'S MOM DIDN'T WANT HER
TO DATE ME,

03:43.424 --> 03:44.795
BUT IF I DIDN'T GO FOR IT,

03:44.795 --> 03:47.398
THIS MAGICAL THING NEVER
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

03:47.398 --> 03:48.429
AW.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.431
HE'S TALKING
ABOUT HIM AND BOBBY.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.562
(chuckles)
I LOVE YOU, BUDDY.

03:51.562 --> 03:53.304
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW.

03:53.304 --> 03:56.467
IT'S A SPLIT, SO...
BREAK THE TIE, LIFE PARTNER.

03:56.467 --> 04:00.240
WELL, I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
THAT I COULD CARE LESS.

04:01.512 --> 04:02.973
NO. IT'S--I'M NEUTRAL.

04:02.973 --> 04:05.676
I'M LIKE SWITZERLAND. (sighs)
YOU SEE, IN WORLD WAR II,

04:05.676 --> 04:07.618
SWITZERLAND ACTED AS A N--

04:07.618 --> 04:09.780
REALLY?
THIS IS THE NEW THING WE DO?

04:09.780 --> 04:12.523
WE PRETEND TO BE ASLEEP WHEN
SOMEONE TRIES TO EDUCATE US?

04:12.523 --> 04:14.285
THIS ISN'T NEW.
NO.

04:14.285 --> 04:17.688
MAYBE THEY CAN DATE SOMEDAY,
LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHEN I'M DEAD,

04:17.688 --> 04:19.360
BUT FOR NOW,
TRAVIS STILL LIVES

04:19.360 --> 04:21.292
WITH ME SOMETIMES,
AND LAURIE'S MY FRIEND.

04:21.292 --> 04:22.933
(sighs) I JUST--
THIS WILL AFFECT ME

04:22.933 --> 04:24.995
WAY WORSE
THAN IT WILL AFFECT YOU.

04:24.995 --> 04:26.767
ALL RIGHT. I GET IT.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.599
I'LL HAVE A TALK WITH HIM.
(pats hand)

04:31.672 --> 04:33.574
(door closes)
HEY, BUD.

04:33.574 --> 04:36.507
CAN WE, UH... (sighs)
CAN WE TALK ABOUT LAURIE?

04:36.507 --> 04:39.810
(inhales deeply) YOU KNOW
I REALLY LIKE HER, HUH?

04:39.810 --> 04:40.811
(chuckles)
YEAH, I CAN TELL BY THE WAY

04:40.811 --> 04:42.753
YOU STARE AT HER BREASTS--

04:42.753 --> 04:45.316
DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY
YOU STARE AT OTHER BREASTS,

04:45.316 --> 04:46.687
MORE RESPECTFUL.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.319
SHOULD I GO FOR IT?
(chuckles)

04:48.319 --> 04:51.622
(inhales deeply)
HELL, YEAH.

04:51.622 --> 04:54.064
GO BE THE SHOULDER FOR HER
TO CRY ON.

04:54.064 --> 04:55.065
NOW BRING IT IN.

04:55.065 --> 04:56.897
(chuckles)

04:56.897 --> 04:58.929
I FEEL LIKE
I'M CHEATING ON ANDY.

04:58.929 --> 05:02.072
I'M YOUR SON,
SO... IT'S FINE.

05:02.072 --> 05:07.307
WOW. THE EYE OF THE HURRICANE
CAN BE UP TO 20 MILES WIDE.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.380
(snores)

05:09.380 --> 05:10.441
REALLY?

05:10.441 --> 05:11.582
RULES ARE RULES.

05:11.582 --> 05:13.484
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
I'M SHUTTING DOWN EARLY.

05:13.484 --> 05:14.445
(clangs)

05:14.445 --> 05:15.486
YOU AIN'T GOTTA GO HOME,

05:15.486 --> 05:17.518
BUT YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.
(chuckles)

05:17.518 --> 05:19.319
AND TOWEL ON THE SHOULDER
FOR...

05:19.319 --> 05:20.821
(towel snaps)
(deep voice) BAM!

05:20.821 --> 05:22.493
(laughs, normal voice)
HOW AWESOME IS IT

05:22.493 --> 05:24.655
THAT I GET TO SAY THAT
EVERY NIGHT?

05:24.655 --> 05:27.628
IF BY "AWESOME,"
YOU MEAN "LAME AND SAD."

05:27.628 --> 05:30.501
OH, SNAP. (chuckles)
BUT SHE'S RIGHT.

05:30.501 --> 05:32.503
IT IS A LITTLE BIT
OF A CLICHE.

05:32.503 --> 05:34.505
AND THAT'S COMING FROM
SOMEONE WHO JUST LEARNED

05:34.505 --> 05:35.936
"OH, SNAP."
YEAH.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.538
YOU GUYS DON'T LIKE
MY CATCHPHRASE?

05:37.538 --> 05:39.840
BUT THAT'S WHY I GOT A BAR
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

05:39.840 --> 05:40.911
YOU KNOW, TO SHUT IT DOWN.

05:40.911 --> 05:42.843
IT'S ALWAYS THE BEST PART
OF MY DAY.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.344
GIANT "THANKS"
FROM YOUR FIANCEE.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.816
(chuckles)
OH, BEFORE THE HURRICANE PARTY,

05:45.816 --> 05:47.848
WE HAVE
TO STOP BY BOBBY'S BOAT.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.520
WHY?

05:49.520 --> 05:51.482
(New England accent)
SHE'S NOT GONNA LET US OUT.
(wind whistling)

05:51.482 --> 05:53.353
(thunder crashing)
(New England accent)
WE'RE HEADED INTO THE HEART

05:53.353 --> 05:55.556
OF THE MONSTER!

05:57.458 --> 05:59.890
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING!

05:59.890 --> 06:01.532
WE'RE PLAYING
"THE PERFECT STORM"!

06:01.532 --> 06:03.764
DO YOUR JOB
AND BE THE STORM!

06:03.764 --> 06:08.799
(wind continues whistling)
OHH! OHH!

06:08.799 --> 06:11.141
(New England accent)
OH, MY GOD!

06:11.141 --> 06:13.404
(New England accent)
THAT'S A WICKED HUGE WAVE!

06:13.404 --> 06:16.577
(New England accent)
HOLD ON!

06:16.577 --> 06:19.550
COME ON, YOU BITCH!

06:19.550 --> 06:20.551
(cell phone rings)

06:20.551 --> 06:23.414
(normal voice) HEY, TRAV!

06:23.414 --> 06:25.416
YEAH, WE'RE ABOUT TO GET
HIT BY A GIANT WAVE!

06:25.416 --> 06:27.718
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE AND STUFF!
WHAT'S UP?

06:27.718 --> 06:29.389
I JUST, UH, WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

06:29.389 --> 06:30.891
THAT I'M GONNA RIDE OUT
THE STORM HERE AT LAURIE'S.

06:30.891 --> 06:31.892
(grunts)

06:31.892 --> 06:33.964
(whispering) SORRY.

06:33.964 --> 06:35.395
TELL DAD HE WAS RIGHT.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.429
BEING THE SHOULDER TO CRY ON
IS A POWER MOVE.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.402
ELLIE, DRENCH HIM.

06:43.434 --> 06:45.936
(gasps) SERIOUSLY?!

06:45.936 --> 06:49.480
I'M ONLY AN OKAY STORM!
I'M NOT A PERFECT STORM!

06:49.480 --> 06:51.582
(New England accent)
WELL, THIS IS A PISSER!

06:56.817 --> 06:57.918
LAURIE,
COME TO OUR HURRICANE PARTY.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.450
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

06:59.450 --> 07:02.022
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN EVEN COLOR IN
MY GRAY HAIR WITH BLACK MARKER.

07:02.022 --> 07:06.096
(grunts) SO YOUR MOM WANTS US
TO HANG OVER THERE.

07:06.096 --> 07:09.059
YEAH. TOTALLY.

07:09.059 --> 07:11.462
SHOULD WE GO? LET'S STAY.

07:11.462 --> 07:13.564
OR GO. I MEAN, GOING'S GOOD,
BUT STAYING'S GOOD, TOO, RIGHT,

07:13.564 --> 07:15.435
BECAUSE YOU'RE LIKE, OHH,
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE HAVE TO GO.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.507
BESIDES, IF WE GO,

07:16.507 --> 07:17.868
ONCE WE GET THERE,
WE'RE JUST GONNA STAY THERE.

07:17.868 --> 07:19.069
I MEAN, GOING IS JUST STAYING
IN A DIFFERENT PLACE, RIGHT?

07:19.069 --> 07:21.041
(strained voice)
CAN I HAVE SOME WATER?

07:21.041 --> 07:23.844
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TOLD TRAV TO COMFORT LAURIE.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.216
WHENEVER YOU COMFORTED ME,
MY PANTIES DISAPPEARED.

07:26.216 --> 07:28.919
(chuckles) I'M SMARTER
THAN PEOPLE THINK.

07:28.919 --> 07:31.181
YOU JUST ATE
YOUR HOODIE STRING.

07:31.181 --> 07:32.583
(spits)
(Jules) NO MORE TALKING.

07:32.583 --> 07:35.556
I'M JUST TOO MAD.
LET'S WATCH THE MOVIE.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.487
(sighs)

07:36.487 --> 07:37.528
(Bobby and Andy) OHH.
OHH! I CAN'T B--

07:37.528 --> 07:39.530
STILL NO TALKING.

07:39.530 --> 07:40.591
(thunder rumbling)

07:40.591 --> 07:42.563
WORST HURRICANE PARTY EVER.

07:42.563 --> 07:45.566
DEAR GOD,
WE'RE OUT OF WINE.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.538
FOR THE FIRST TIME
THIS STORM,

07:47.538 --> 07:49.199
I'M SCARED.

07:49.199 --> 07:52.042
LOOK, I THINK WE SHOULD JUST
LET TRAV DATE LAURIE.
(bottle clatters)

07:52.042 --> 07:53.073
NO. (sighs)

07:53.073 --> 07:54.104
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS PLAY
A GAME FOR IT?

07:54.104 --> 07:55.606
WINNER GETS THEIR WAY.

07:55.606 --> 07:57.107
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO
ON "THE BRADY BUNCH."

07:57.107 --> 08:00.080
OOH, SIDE NOTE. HAVE YOU GUYS
SEEN PETER BRADY LATELY?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.582
GUY'S YOKED.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.654
DIDN'T HE SLEEP
WITH MRS. BRADY?
THAT WAS GREG.

08:03.654 --> 08:04.915
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY
SOME STUPID GAME.

08:04.915 --> 08:07.487
WE'VE GOT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT
THINGS TO DO.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.859
WHAT GAME DO YOU WANT
TO PLAY?

08:08.859 --> 08:09.860
SCRABBLE.
TABOO.

08:09.860 --> 08:10.921
BUTT BALL.

08:10.921 --> 08:13.123
ALL SOUND GREAT,
ESPECIALLY BUTT BALL,

08:13.123 --> 08:14.264
WHATEVER THAT IS.

08:14.264 --> 08:15.626
WHY DON'T WE PLAY A GAME

08:15.626 --> 08:17.267
TO DECIDE
WHAT GAME WE'RE GONNA PLAY?

08:17.267 --> 08:18.268
(penny clanks)

08:18.268 --> 08:20.130
(all, singsongy) PENNY CAN!

08:20.130 --> 08:22.502
(normal voice)
WE'RE PLAYING CELEBRITY.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.035
CAN TRAVIS AND LAURIE MAKE
SWEET, SWEET LOVE?

08:25.035 --> 08:26.076
WINNER DECIDES.

08:26.076 --> 08:28.639
30 SECONDS IS ON THE CLOCK,
AND BEGIN.

08:28.639 --> 08:29.940
OKAY. THIS ACTRESS...

08:29.940 --> 08:31.612
JULIA ROBERTS.
LET ME FINISH--

08:31.612 --> 08:32.813
WHO IS NOT JULIA ROBERTS,

08:32.813 --> 08:34.585
WAS IN
THE MOVIE "LEGALLY BLONDE."

08:34.585 --> 08:35.916
(chuckles) I KNOW IT.
UM, OKAY, SHE WAS,

08:35.916 --> 08:38.719
UH, MARRIED TO AN ACTOR,
AND THEN THEY--THEY BROKE UP,

08:38.719 --> 08:40.551
AND THEN SHE GOT MARRIED
TO THIS OTHER GUY.

08:40.551 --> 08:41.622
HE'S, UM,
HE SEEMS REALLY NICE,

08:41.622 --> 08:43.854
AND HE'S GOT,
UH, A VERY NICE FACE.

08:43.854 --> 08:45.025
HEY, YOU GUYS.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.827
TIME OUT.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.659
(whispers) HI.
OHH.

08:48.659 --> 08:50.631
(whispers indistinctly)

08:50.631 --> 08:51.662
(lowered voice)
REESE WITHERSPOON?

08:51.662 --> 08:53.303
REESE WITHERSPOON!
COUNT IT.

08:53.303 --> 08:54.565
(strained voice) WHAT?

08:54.565 --> 08:56.306
YOU STILL LOOK SO SAD.

08:56.306 --> 08:59.640
TRAV, TAKE HER UP TO MY BEDROOM
AND LET HER LIE DOWN.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.310
DONE.

09:03.714 --> 09:05.646
WHAT?

09:05.646 --> 09:07.017
YOU JUST SENT THE TWO PEOPLE
THAT YOU DON'T WANT

09:07.017 --> 09:09.650
TO BE TOGETHER TO GO
HANG OUT IN A BEDROOM.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.322
(chuckles) WHO WOULD HAVE SEX
IN THEIR MOM'S BED?

09:12.322 --> 09:13.984
UH, BEEN THERE.
(clicks tongue)

09:13.984 --> 09:15.956
SHOOT.
(clink)

09:15.956 --> 09:17.758
HOW MANY TIMES AM I GONNA
DO THAT?!

09:17.758 --> 09:19.189
(clatter)

09:23.163 --> 09:25.165
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SUCK THE CORK?

09:25.165 --> 09:27.698
YOU'RE JOKING,
BUT I ALREADY DID.

09:27.698 --> 09:28.939
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

09:28.939 --> 09:30.601
WORKING ON
SOME NEW CLOSING LINES

09:30.601 --> 09:31.942
FOR YOUR BAR?

09:31.942 --> 09:35.045
RIGHT NOW I'M REALLY
LIKING THE WORD "DOWN."

09:35.045 --> 09:36.907
YOU KNOW, FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S A GREAT RHYME WORD.

09:36.907 --> 09:39.680
JUST OFF THE TOP...
"TOWN."

09:39.680 --> 09:41.151
OHH.
"DRINK IT DOWN.

09:41.151 --> 09:42.212
I'LL SEE YA IN TOWN."

09:42.212 --> 09:45.585
"DRINK IT DOWN.
WATCH OUT FOR CLOWNS."

09:45.585 --> 09:49.119
IT'S SO SAD,
I'M LOSING MY CORK BUZZ.

09:49.119 --> 09:50.220
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME?

09:50.220 --> 09:52.893
I USED TO BE ON TOP
OF ALL THE COOL LINGO.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.666
Y-YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE SAY,
"HEY, YOU WANT TO COME WITH US?"

09:55.666 --> 09:58.128
I WAS THE GUY
WHO DROPPED THE "US" PART.
OH.

09:58.128 --> 10:00.631
"HEY, YOU WANT TO COME WITH?"
(chuckles)

10:00.631 --> 10:02.302
I WONDER WHAT
THOSE D-BAGS DID

10:02.302 --> 10:05.075
WITH ALL THE TIME
YOU SAVED THEM.

10:06.737 --> 10:09.680
BEDROOM DOOR OPEN.
GAME BACK ON.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.682
MM.

10:11.682 --> 10:13.914
SOMEBODY ALREADY GOT THIS ONE?

10:13.914 --> 10:15.615
UH, MONKEY ACTOR.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.387
CHARLTON HESTON.
THAT GUY.

10:17.387 --> 10:19.049
TOM BERENGER.
MUSTACHE.

10:19.049 --> 10:20.691
TOM SELLECK.
BETTER MUSTACHE.

10:20.691 --> 10:22.052
OOH! BURT REYNOLDS.

10:22.052 --> 10:23.623
NO MUSTACHE
BUT SHOULD HAVE ONE.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.355
HARRISON FORD!
TIME.

10:25.355 --> 10:26.927
THEY'RE KILLING US
WITH MUSTACHE CLUES.

10:26.927 --> 10:30.230
AFTER ROUND ONE, IT'S, UH,
ANDY AND BOBBY--12...

10:30.230 --> 10:31.631
12.
JULES AND ELLIE--

10:31.631 --> 10:33.664
A HARD-FOUGHT ZERO.

10:33.664 --> 10:34.805
(blows raspberry)
(chuckles)

10:34.805 --> 10:37.067
WHY DID YOU PICK THIS GAME
IF YOU SUCK AT IT?

10:37.067 --> 10:40.040
ME? ALAN ALDA DIDN'T INVENT
THE POLIO VACCINE!

10:40.040 --> 10:41.972
YOU KNEW WHAT I MEANT!

10:41.972 --> 10:43.313
(Jules and Ellie arguing
indistinctly)
(lowered voice) WE'D BETTER

10:43.313 --> 10:45.175
GET SOME WINE IN THESE GALS,
OR THEY'RE GONNA TURN ON US.

10:45.175 --> 10:47.878
WHAT ARE
YOU IDIOTS WHISPERING ABOUT?!

10:47.878 --> 10:49.179
(chuckles) I'LL DRIVE.

10:49.179 --> 10:51.281
OKAY.

10:51.281 --> 10:53.323
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

10:53.323 --> 10:56.957
EVERY GUY THAT I DATE
LEAVES ME.

10:56.957 --> 11:00.060
WADE ENLISTED
FOR ANOTHER TOUR.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.432
SMITH JUST DUMPED ME.

11:02.432 --> 11:04.835
DALE BLEW HIMSELF UP
IN A METH LAB.

11:04.835 --> 11:06.837
YOU CAN'T TAKE EXPLOSIONS
SO PERSONALLY.

11:06.837 --> 11:09.139
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
THEY'RE JUST EXPLOSIONS.

11:09.139 --> 11:13.103
WHAT YOU NEED IS TO DATE SOMEONE
WHO'S GONNA PUT YOUR HAPPINESS

11:13.103 --> 11:14.705
BEFORE THEIR OWN.

11:14.705 --> 11:16.306
BUT DOES THAT GUY
EVEN EXIST?

11:16.306 --> 11:20.250
(chuckles) I THINK HE DOES.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.813
JUST PROMISE ME YOU WON'T
GIVE UP ON WADE TOO QUICKLY.

11:22.813 --> 11:25.455
HE IS BUILT LIKE
A BLACK PETER BRADY.

11:25.455 --> 11:26.917
YEAH, ALMOST
A LITTLE TOO MUSCLE-Y.

11:26.917 --> 11:28.859
GIRLS DON'T REALLY LIKE THAT.

11:28.859 --> 11:31.321
THAT'S JUST WHAT I TOLD YOU
WHEN YOU WERE DIAGNOSED

11:31.321 --> 11:33.463
WITH LOW TESTOSTERONE.
(chuckles)

11:33.463 --> 11:34.995
(lowered voice)
HE STILL TAKES PILLS.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.998
(clenched teeth) MOM! WHY?

11:37.998 --> 11:40.831
AAH!
WHY'D YOU KEEP STOPPING TO DO

11:40.831 --> 11:43.003
THOSE MICHAEL JACKSON POSES
IN THE WIND?

11:43.003 --> 11:45.175
DUDE, HOW COULD YOU NOT?

11:45.175 --> 11:47.477
OH!

11:51.011 --> 11:52.012
(switches click)

11:52.012 --> 11:54.444
WHOA! POWER WORKS!

11:54.444 --> 11:57.117
WE GOT FOOD, WE GOT TUNES,
AND WE GOT...

11:57.117 --> 11:58.418
(high-pitched voice) BOOZE!

11:58.418 --> 12:00.420
(laughs)
COULD THIS GET ANY BETTER?
(laughs)

12:00.420 --> 12:05.025
(Afrobeta) в™Є DO YOU PARTY? в™Є

12:05.025 --> 12:06.857
в™Є IT'S COOL WITH ME в™Є

12:06.857 --> 12:08.198
в™Є EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW в™Є

12:08.198 --> 12:11.762
в™Є WHERE'S THE PARTY? в™Є

12:11.762 --> 12:14.164
в™Є JUST YOU AND ME в™Є

12:15.165 --> 12:16.837
WE SAW THE LIGHTS.

12:16.837 --> 12:20.370
UM, CAN WE WAIT OUT THE STORM
WHILE OUR DRESSES DRY OUT?

12:20.370 --> 12:22.212
MM-HMM.

12:22.212 --> 12:23.373
(phone beeps)

12:23.373 --> 12:25.475
GRAYSON SAID
THEY'RE STUCK AT THE BAR.

12:25.475 --> 12:28.278
OH, GOOD. WE CAN WORK
ON OUR CHEATING PLAN.

12:28.278 --> 12:30.250
OH.
YOU KNOW,
PROFESSIONAL GAMBLERS CHEAT

12:30.250 --> 12:33.924
WITH A VERY COMPLICATED SYSTEM
OF, LIKE, FINGER TAP--

12:33.924 --> 12:36.156
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU!

12:36.156 --> 12:37.757
SORRY. HOW LONG WAS I OUT?

12:37.757 --> 12:38.758
LOOK...
(clatters)

12:38.758 --> 12:41.231
NEXT TIME I GIVE A CLUE,
JUST SAY AN ANSWER.

12:41.231 --> 12:43.934
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY,
I'M GONNA SAY IT'S RIGHT.

12:43.934 --> 12:44.935
OKAY.

12:44.935 --> 12:47.938
THAT HANDSOME ACTOR
THAT YOU LOVE.

12:47.938 --> 12:49.269
GEORGE DiCAPRIO. (chuckles)

12:49.269 --> 12:50.370
I'LL MAKE IT WORK. (sighs)

12:50.370 --> 12:52.102
OUT OF CURIOSITY,
WHEN GRAYSON CALLED,

12:52.102 --> 12:54.144
DID HE SOUND SAD?

12:54.144 --> 12:58.208
(cheering)

12:58.208 --> 13:00.210
OLDER GUYS ARE THE BEST!

13:00.210 --> 13:01.411
ARE YOU THREE REAL?

13:03.914 --> 13:05.355
(door closes)

13:05.355 --> 13:07.557
OH, SNAP.

13:07.557 --> 13:10.861
BEFORE YOU GET MAD,
THESE GIRLS MAY NOT BE REAL.

13:10.861 --> 13:12.522
(sighs)
(Grayson) SORRY, LADIES.

13:12.522 --> 13:15.395
TIME TO SHUT HER DOWN.
(chuckles)

13:15.395 --> 13:17.067
(clangs)

13:17.067 --> 13:20.100
THAT'S ALL SHE DRANK, FOLKS.
SEE YA ON THE FLIP.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.231
(snaps)

13:21.231 --> 13:22.873
WORST ONE YET.

13:22.873 --> 13:23.934
(sighs)

13:23.934 --> 13:28.278
(grunts) WHAT?
WHERE DID EVERYBODY GO?

13:28.278 --> 13:30.280
I DON'T KNOW.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.942
WE COULD GO LOOK FOR 'EM,

13:31.942 --> 13:34.114
OR WE COULD STAY.
I MEAN, STAYING'S GOOD.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.445
IF WE GO,
THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE--
OH, DUDE.

13:35.445 --> 13:37.817
(sighs) DUDE, I CAN'T GO
THROUGH IT AGAIN.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.120
OHH. (sighs)
(thunder crashes)

13:40.120 --> 13:43.393
I USED TO BE SO SCARED
OF THUNDER WHEN I WAS A KID.

13:43.393 --> 13:45.255
I CAN'T IMAGINE YOU SCARED
OF ANYTHING.

13:45.255 --> 13:48.828
MM. (inhales deeply)

13:48.828 --> 13:51.301
(sighs) OHH.

13:51.301 --> 13:54.304
THIS IS ACTUALLY KIND OF
ROMANTIC.

13:54.304 --> 13:57.837
IT KINDA FEELS LIKE WE'RE
THE LAST TWO PEOPLE ON EARTH.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.609
AWESOME.

13:59.609 --> 14:03.013
DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU SAY
"AWESOME" WHEN YOU'RE NERVOUS?

14:03.013 --> 14:04.945
THAT'S AWESOME. (laughs)
(laughs)

14:04.945 --> 14:06.947
(Wade)
Laurie? Is that you?

14:06.947 --> 14:07.617
WHY IS THE COUCH TALKING?

14:07.617 --> 14:09.619
L-Laurie?

14:09.619 --> 14:11.281
WADE?

14:11.281 --> 14:12.622
(sighs)

14:12.622 --> 14:15.285
(whispers) AWESOME.

14:18.989 --> 14:19.990
EEE!

14:19.990 --> 14:22.492
OHH! SPLIT THE CHEEKS!

14:22.492 --> 14:23.493
HEY, YOU CAN'T GO
FOR THE EXTRA POINT

14:23.493 --> 14:24.594
UNLESS THE GIRLS
CLOSE THEIR EYES.

14:24.594 --> 14:26.496
LOOK, STOP PLAYING
BUTT BALL, OKAY?

14:26.496 --> 14:29.039
COME OVER HERE
AND CONCENTRATE ON CELEBRITY.

14:29.039 --> 14:31.371
THE GIRLS ARE MAKING
AN INSANE COMEBACK.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.043
AND... GO.

14:33.043 --> 14:34.174
THIS ACTRESS--

14:34.174 --> 14:35.575
UH, GWYNETH PALTROW.
YES.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.207
THIS ACTRESS--

14:37.207 --> 14:38.308
GWYNETH PALTROW.
YES.

14:38.308 --> 14:39.449
(laughs)
(smacks table)

14:39.449 --> 14:40.480
THIS ACTRESS...

14:40.480 --> 14:42.882
GW--
NOT GWYNETH PALTROW,

14:42.882 --> 14:45.285
IS IN YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.416
E.T.

14:47.557 --> 14:49.359
YES! WE'RE OUT OF CLUES!

14:49.359 --> 14:50.590
AAH! (laughs)
(chuckles)

14:50.590 --> 14:53.193
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
I THOUGHT E.T. WAS A DUDE.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.225
HE WAS BOTH.

14:55.225 --> 14:59.329
WATCH THE DELETED SCENES.
IT'S VERY DISTURBING.

14:59.329 --> 15:01.901
(whispers) HE TRIES
TO HAVE SEX WITH HIMSELF.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.505
Baby, are you okay?

15:05.505 --> 15:08.138
(voice breaking)
NO, I AM SAD ALL THE TIME,

15:08.138 --> 15:09.909
AND PEOPLE LOOK AT ME
LIKE I'M CRAZY

15:09.909 --> 15:11.081
WHEN I TAKE YOU OUT
TO DINNER,

15:11.081 --> 15:14.284
BUT IT WAS OKAY
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT

15:14.284 --> 15:16.486
WE WERE... (sighs)
HEADING SOMEWHERE, BUT...

15:17.647 --> 15:21.421
(sighs) WE'RE NOT, ARE WE?

15:21.421 --> 15:22.692
(whispers) GOD.

15:22.692 --> 15:25.555
Laurie? H-hello?

15:25.555 --> 15:27.527
(whimpers in high-pitched voice)

15:27.527 --> 15:29.499
Uh, excuse me.
I heard a woman whimper.

15:29.499 --> 15:31.031
Uh, ma'am, if you--
if you're there,

15:31.031 --> 15:33.263
can you, uh,
can you, like, pick me up?

15:33.263 --> 15:35.535
(Tom)
DUDE, JUST TALK TO HIM.

15:35.535 --> 15:39.509
TOM, IT'S A HURRICANE!
GO HOME!

15:39.509 --> 15:41.511
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE, OKAY?
IT'S GOT A GOOD MESSAGE.

15:43.213 --> 15:44.544
(clangs)

15:44.544 --> 15:46.046
IT'S CLOSING TIME!

15:46.046 --> 15:48.518
I KNOW YOU'RE SAD,
BUT DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE.

15:48.518 --> 15:50.550
YOU MIGHT KILL YOUR DAD.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.621
(snaps)
(lowered voice) WHA-BAM!

15:52.622 --> 15:53.623
TOO DEPRESSING?

15:53.623 --> 15:55.185
TOO EVERYTHING.

15:55.185 --> 15:56.726
IT'S NOT AS EASY
AS YOU THINK.

15:56.726 --> 15:58.388
(sighs)
(clangs)

15:58.388 --> 16:00.060
TIME TO GO.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.232
DRINK LOTS OF WATER,
TAKE SOME ASPIRIN,

16:02.232 --> 16:04.534
AND WE'LL DO IT AGAIN
TOMORROW.

16:04.534 --> 16:05.695
(snaps)

16:05.695 --> 16:07.597
YOU'RE A NATURAL, BOO.

16:07.597 --> 16:08.698
THAT'S MINE.
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.541
(sighs)
YOU REMEMBER THE LAST TIME

16:11.541 --> 16:13.703
YOU AND I WERE STUCK
IN A HURRICANE?

16:13.703 --> 16:15.405
(chuckles) OH, YEAH.
WHEN WE WERE HAVING SEX,

16:15.405 --> 16:17.547
WE KNOCKED OVER
SO MANY CANDLES. (chuckles)

16:17.547 --> 16:18.548
(chuckles)

16:18.548 --> 16:20.350
OH. GRAYSON.

16:20.350 --> 16:23.413
WHAT? NO. YOU GUYS ARE OBVIOUSLY
HAVING FUN REMINISCING.

16:23.413 --> 16:24.714
(clatters)

16:24.714 --> 16:26.686
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT
THE NAUGHTY PART.

16:26.686 --> 16:27.757
(chuckles)

16:27.757 --> 16:29.219
YOU KNOW, TRAV WAS
SO SCARED OF THE STORM

16:29.219 --> 16:31.291
THAT YOU LET HIM SLEEP
IN OUR BED.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.692
(chuckles) OH.
THEN WE ALL GOT WRAPPED UP

16:32.692 --> 16:33.723
IN THAT DOWN COMFORTER...

16:33.723 --> 16:34.764
(chuckles) AND HE TURNED
THE WHOLE THING

16:34.764 --> 16:37.597
INTO
ONE GIANT URINE BURRITO.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.569
(chuckles)
WELL, HE WAS ONLY 5.

16:39.569 --> 16:41.471
MAYBE 10.

16:41.471 --> 16:43.333
LOOK, I KNOW I PROMISED TO
TAKE CARE OF THIS LAURIE THING,

16:43.333 --> 16:45.605
BUT I JUST ENDED UP
PUSHING HIM RIGHT TOWARD HER.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.607
I JUST COULDN'T HELP IT.

16:47.607 --> 16:48.638
THE SECOND I MENTIONED
LAURIE'S NAME,

16:48.638 --> 16:51.341
HE JUST SMILED THIS SMILE,

16:51.341 --> 16:53.713
AND THEN I WANTED HIM
TO HAVE WHATEVER HE WANTED.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.716
BOBBY COBB, WHEN YOU ARE
BEING EARNEST,

16:56.716 --> 16:59.349
YOU ARE ONE SEXY MAN.

16:59.349 --> 17:00.750
PRETZELS FOR MY SWEETHEART.

17:00.750 --> 17:01.751
(clattering)
OH.

17:01.751 --> 17:02.752
(clatters)

17:02.752 --> 17:05.455
WELL, THAT'S JUST
BAD TIMING.

17:05.455 --> 17:06.726
Laurie talks about you
a lot, Trav.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.698
You know, it's good
to know she's not alone.

17:08.698 --> 17:11.361
I'M SURE SHE'D BE HAPPIER
IF YOU WERE HERE.

17:11.361 --> 17:12.762
No question. (chuckles)

17:12.762 --> 17:14.404
MAYBE A LITTLE QUESTION.
(chuckles)

17:14.404 --> 17:16.506
All right.
Well, how do I fix this?

17:16.506 --> 17:18.738
WELL, IT WOULD BE EASIER
IF YOU WERE HERE.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.070
YOU COULD HOLD HER HAND

17:20.070 --> 17:22.372
OR... (inhales deeply)
WITH THOSE ARMS,

17:22.372 --> 17:24.674
BREAK A PARK BENCH IN HALF
TO IMPRESS HER.

17:24.674 --> 17:26.516
That's it.

17:26.516 --> 17:28.378
I need you to be my body.

17:28.378 --> 17:30.480
COME AGAIN?

17:36.656 --> 17:39.389
(muffled voice)
LAURIE, CAN WE COME IN?

17:39.389 --> 17:41.791
WHO'S "WE"?

17:41.791 --> 17:44.094
(laughs) OH, MY GOD.

17:44.094 --> 17:47.066
Baby, please dance
with me.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.669
ALL RIGHT.
THE LAST ROUND.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.671
JULES AND ELLIE ONLY NEED
ONE MORE TO WIN.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.443
(Ellie) LET'S END THIS.
(mouths word)

17:53.443 --> 17:55.275
THIS WAY,
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER'S FIRST WORDS

17:55.275 --> 17:57.076
WON'T BE... (high-pitched voice)
"WHAT, WHAT?"

17:58.678 --> 18:00.650
BUT DOES THAT GUY
EVEN EXIST?

18:00.650 --> 18:05.185
(chuckles) I THINK HE DOES.

18:05.185 --> 18:08.188
HE STILL SMILES THE SAME WAY
HE DID WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE KID.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.620
(sighs)

18:10.620 --> 18:12.162
YOU WIN. WE CHEATED.

18:12.162 --> 18:14.664
I KNEW DAVID BARSTOOL
WASN'T AN ACTOR!

18:14.664 --> 18:17.627
(laughs) YOU WERE JUST LOOKING
AT THINGS AROUND THE ROOM.

18:17.627 --> 18:20.830
YEAH. ALTHOUGH I THINK
THAT THERE IS A JIM LAMPLEY.

18:20.830 --> 18:21.731
NOPE.

18:21.731 --> 18:23.603
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY
WITH THIS?

18:23.603 --> 18:25.675
NO, BUT I-I WANT
WHAT TRAVIS WANTS,

18:25.675 --> 18:28.678
HELL, WE ALL LOVE LAURIE,
RIGHT?

18:28.678 --> 18:30.310
YEAH.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.283
ELLIE... (sighs) JUST FAKE IT.

18:33.283 --> 18:35.145
SHE'S AN ANGEL.

18:35.145 --> 18:37.287
AW. SNAP.

18:37.287 --> 18:40.550
IS THIS THE ONLY WAY WE'RE EVER
GONNA BE ABLE TO DANCE?

18:40.550 --> 18:43.553
Trav, put your finger
to my lips.

18:43.553 --> 18:44.554
Shh.

18:44.554 --> 18:45.825
(laughs)
(chuckles)

18:45.825 --> 18:48.228
Hey, can you lean back
so I can look at her face?

18:48.228 --> 18:49.229
(muffled voice)
I'M BREATHING A LOT

18:49.229 --> 18:50.560
OF MY OWN BREATH RIGHT NOW.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.862
(sighs) STARTING TO REGRET
THE TUNA SANDWICH EARLIER.

18:52.862 --> 18:55.735
Can you just freestyle dance
or something while we talk?

18:55.735 --> 18:59.739
When I re-enlisted,
I-I didn't mean to hurt you,

18:59.739 --> 19:00.710
you know,
but these people out here--

19:00.710 --> 19:02.372
they're my family.

19:02.372 --> 19:04.744
All I can do is ask you
to wait,

19:04.744 --> 19:08.378
but if you can't,
I understand.

19:08.378 --> 19:10.250
(inhales deeply and sighs)

19:10.250 --> 19:11.921
(sighs)

19:11.921 --> 19:13.483
GRAB MY TUSH.

19:13.483 --> 19:15.385
(chuckles)
Trav, grab her booty.

19:15.385 --> 19:17.257
NAH, I'M GOOD. (sighs)

19:17.257 --> 19:19.829
Come on, man. Get in there.
Just a handful.

19:19.829 --> 19:21.261
(The Temper Trap)
в™Є YOUR WALLS ARE UP в™Є

19:21.261 --> 19:22.662
OH, WADE.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.734
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN'T DO IT. (sighs)

19:24.734 --> 19:27.267
Uh, baby? Trav fell.
Is--is he okay?

19:27.267 --> 19:28.868
UH, YEAH. NO, HE'S FINE.
(Travis sighs)

19:28.868 --> 19:29.899
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

19:29.899 --> 19:31.271
в™Є UP в™Є

19:31.271 --> 19:32.442
(whispers) UH...

19:32.442 --> 19:33.743
(lowered voice)
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:33.743 --> 19:35.445
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD
GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE,

19:35.445 --> 19:37.777
OR SHOULD I JUST MOVE ON?

19:39.749 --> 19:42.752
HI. THE STORM'S LET UP.

19:42.752 --> 19:44.614
в™Є SO IF YOU FLASH YOUR HEART в™Є

19:44.614 --> 19:45.915
WHAT'S--WHAT'S--
WHAT'S WRONG?

19:45.915 --> 19:48.588
EVERYBODY JUST GOT BACK,
SO I'M GONNA TAKE YOU

19:48.588 --> 19:50.189
UPSTAIRS, ALL RIGHT?

19:50.189 --> 19:51.461
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ALL NIGHT.

19:51.461 --> 19:54.864
(chuckles)

19:54.864 --> 19:57.627
SHE ASKED ME WHAT SHE SHOULD DO,
AND I KNOW SHE'LL REGRET IT

19:57.627 --> 19:59.669
IF SHE DOESN'T SEE IT
THROUGH WITH WADE.

19:59.669 --> 20:01.631
(sighs)
SHE FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE

20:01.631 --> 20:03.633
WHO CARES ABOUT HER HAPPINESS
MORE THAN HIS OWN.

20:03.633 --> 20:04.704
(chuckles)

20:06.276 --> 20:08.778
в™Є OUR LOVE WAS LOST в™Є

20:08.778 --> 20:09.939
в™Є LOST, LOST в™Є

20:09.939 --> 20:12.842
OHH. THAT WAS
A CRAZY STORM, HUH?

20:12.842 --> 20:15.585
YOU KNOW, THE REASON THAT
FLORIDA HAS SO MANY HURRICANES

20:15.585 --> 20:17.617
IS THAT WHEN
THE BAROMETRIC PRESSURE IS--

20:17.617 --> 20:18.988
в™Є FOUND в™Є

20:18.988 --> 20:23.253
YOU GUYS ARE DOING A BIT?
AWESOME. I'M COMING IN.

20:28.258 --> 20:30.430
LOOK, IF YOU WANT
A GOOD CLOSING LINE,

20:30.430 --> 20:31.561
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FACE
THE FACT

20:31.561 --> 20:34.464
THAT YOU'RE NOT
MR. CATCHPHRASE ANYMORE.

20:34.464 --> 20:37.407
STOP LIVING IN THE PAST
AND EMBRACE WHO YOU ARE TODAY--

20:37.407 --> 20:40.910
A TIRED, OLD BARTENDER
WITH A BAD BACK

20:40.910 --> 20:43.773
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO ADMIT
THAT HE'S ALWAYS FREEZING.

20:43.773 --> 20:45.615
I USED TO BE SO WARM.

20:45.615 --> 20:48.448
I KNOW. USE THAT...
(zip)

20:48.448 --> 20:51.921
AND TELL THESE YOUNG PUNKS
HOW YOU REALLY FEEL.

20:51.921 --> 20:54.454
(clatters)

20:54.454 --> 20:56.586
(clangs)

20:56.586 --> 20:58.388
PLEASE GET OUT OF MY BAR.

20:58.388 --> 21:01.761
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME
AND WRAP UP IN MY COZY BLANKET

21:01.761 --> 21:05.295
AND DRINK THAT TEA
WITH THE SLEEPY BEAR ON THE BOX.

21:05.295 --> 21:08.438
I KNOW YOU HATE ME NOW,
BUT YOU'LL THANK ME LATER,

21:08.438 --> 21:10.440
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
STOP DRINKING,

21:10.440 --> 21:13.443
TOMORROW YOU'RE GOING TO WAKE UP
NEXT TO THAT PERSON

21:13.443 --> 21:16.376
THAT YOU'RE TALKING
TO RIGHT NOW,

21:16.376 --> 21:18.508
AND YOU'LL WISH YOU KNEW HOW
TO GET THEM OUT OF YOUR HOUSE,

21:18.508 --> 21:20.980
BUT THEY'RE GONNA MAKE YOU
TAKE THEM TO BRUNCH.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.453
GOOD NIGHT.
DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE.

21:23.453 --> 21:25.014
YOU MIGHT KILL YOUR DAD.

21:25.014 --> 21:27.457
(glasses clattering)

21:27.457 --> 21:28.618
PERFECT.

21:28.618 --> 21:29.619
(snaps)
