WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.471
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO REAL ONES
IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.849
-Hi.
-How are you?

00:16.616 --> 00:17.550
You were right.

00:19.052 --> 00:21.221
We've checked
all the surveillance cameras.

00:21.554 --> 00:23.023
And we've found it.

00:28.628 --> 00:30.830
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

01:53.646 --> 01:58.551
THE FRAGILITY OF BODIES

02:14.200 --> 02:15.768
Excuse me?

02:15.835 --> 02:18.271
I'm looking for someone
who lives in this house.

02:18.338 --> 02:19.806
That is inhabited.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.274
I got this address.

02:21.741 --> 02:22.909
It's always been inhabited.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.112
Do you know this boy?

02:28.915 --> 02:30.917
This is to thank me
for the favors?

02:31.451 --> 02:33.052
This is crazy.
How much was it?

02:33.553 --> 02:35.688
Enough to ask you
for another favor.

02:38.224 --> 02:41.327
I need you to find
the address for this phone.

02:41.394 --> 02:42.795
I think this is the house
where lives the boy...

02:42.862 --> 02:45.031
that Carranza hit,
Nahuel Suárez.

02:45.932 --> 02:47.400
Nahuel Suárez...

02:48.001 --> 02:49.302
The address
was not on the file?

02:49.636 --> 02:52.438
It was.
But it is fake.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.040
It's a vacant lot.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.808
Give me a couple of hours
to see what I can do.

03:03.616 --> 03:07.687
-Jonathan Cisneros.
-Who is he?

03:07.754 --> 03:09.055
Another boy.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.890
The only one, out of the seven,
who was uninjured.

03:11.891 --> 03:12.992
There is nothing on the file.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.328
Not even who drove the train.

03:15.695 --> 03:16.763
And you want to find him.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.965
-I want to try.
-I'll do my best.

03:19.299 --> 03:20.967
Anyway, if there is
nothing on the file...

03:21.034 --> 03:22.802
-The judge was Romanín.
-Really?

03:23.870 --> 03:26.706
Ask you father. They play golf
together every week.

03:26.773 --> 03:27.740
I know.

03:28.074 --> 03:29.275
But my father
does not ride a bike.

03:29.609 --> 03:31.511
And the helmet
can not be returned.

03:34.113 --> 03:36.583
Two to zero!

03:36.983 --> 03:39.719
Since I became a Chacarita fan,
it's lost all the matches.

03:39.786 --> 03:41.054
Soccer is like that.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.455
Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.425
What's wrong with you?

03:50.763 --> 03:52.031
I have to move out.

03:53.132 --> 03:55.268
I can't continue living
in that lousy boarding house.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.937
I need a decent place
to take my daughter.

03:58.004 --> 03:59.372
Where she can have her own room.

03:59.706 --> 04:01.975
-Move out then.
-It's not so easy.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.645
I can't even afford
a one-bedroom apartment.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.615
Two months in advance.
A property as a warranty.

04:08.948 --> 04:10.149
It all a fortune.

04:10.216 --> 04:13.052
I can give you
my property as a warranty.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.989
Thank you very much.
But I need money.

04:19.626 --> 04:22.528
I've made up my mind.
I'll become a Chicago fan.

04:22.895 --> 04:24.797
-You can't do that.
-Why not?

04:24.864 --> 04:26.266
Because your team is Chacarita.

04:26.332 --> 04:29.135
You can't change teams
because yours is doing badly.

04:29.535 --> 04:30.703
It's just like life.

04:30.770 --> 04:31.871
You were born Chinese,
you'll die that way.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.406
You were born a Chacarita fan,
you'll die that way.

04:34.140 --> 04:35.675
I can choose to have
another citizenship though.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.611
Shut up, please.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.215
Come in.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.654
I've come to say hi.
So you don't complain about me.

04:48.554 --> 04:51.924
You're planning
a dinner party for the 23rd.

04:53.159 --> 04:56.362
For the 23rd.?
Is that necessary, dad?

04:56.429 --> 05:00.300
No, but we agreed to do that
with your sisters.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.836
Why don't we celebrate
her birthday...

05:03.903 --> 05:05.338
instead of the day
of her death?

05:05.705 --> 05:07.440
We don't get together
to celebrate her death.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.542
It's to remember
your mother's death.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.477
If you don't want to come,
it's fine.

05:11.844 --> 05:13.012
You don't have to.

05:15.515 --> 05:18.384
If all agree, let's do it.

05:19.018 --> 05:21.487
It can be either at home
or at Leti's.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.089
We can also meet
at my apartment.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.024
It's not big
but we are not so many.

05:25.591 --> 05:28.394
All right, your apartment then.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.663
I'll bring the food.
You make some dessert.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.699
There is no need.
I'll take care of everything.

05:34.033 --> 05:36.069
To make potato knishes
is not rocket science.

05:37.437 --> 05:39.005
Where did you get
the money from?

05:39.539 --> 05:40.907
I can't tell you.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.042
I won't tell anybody.

05:44.243 --> 05:46.112
Bullshit!
You'll spill the beans.

05:48.815 --> 05:49.949
You stole it.

05:50.316 --> 05:52.185
I didn't.
I can earn more if I want to.

05:52.885 --> 05:54.754
I also want to earn money.

06:00.626 --> 06:02.095
I want to buy
new soccer boots.

06:02.428 --> 06:05.932
They cost 1,000 pesos.
Replicas.

06:06.966 --> 06:09.268
The original ones cost
about 2,500.

06:10.169 --> 06:11.537
How will you get that amount?

06:13.940 --> 06:15.641
You think you're so smart.

06:25.084 --> 06:25.985
Here he is.

06:26.753 --> 06:29.188
Actually, he is not in a coma,
but in a vegetative state.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.858
-What is the difference?
-Does it matter?

06:33.426 --> 06:34.794
I'm sorry.
Two buses have crashed.

06:35.194 --> 06:36.396
They are bringing
the casualties over here.

06:36.796 --> 06:38.331
This will be a chaos
in a few minutes.

06:38.731 --> 06:39.832
Don't worry.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.802
My sister told me
it was a train accident.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.504
How did you get
that information?

06:44.871 --> 06:46.739
I can't remember.
I think a relative told us.

06:47.106 --> 06:49.308
-Who?
-His father or his uncle.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.444
Only his mother has come lately.

06:53.446 --> 06:54.914
Here we go.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.250
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.810
I've got the address
you were looking for.

07:58.177 --> 07:59.412
It's a shantytown.

07:59.846 --> 08:01.614
Los Piletones, in Soldati.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.753
Send it over to me, please.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.992
Are you there?

08:22.034 --> 08:25.137
Block Four, House Nr. 39.
Los Piletones.

08:25.204 --> 08:28.274
What about the other boy,
Jonathan?

08:38.985 --> 08:41.187
-How are you doing?
-Fine.

08:43.422 --> 08:46.092
Can you show me a draft
of your story?

08:47.026 --> 08:48.728
Actually, there is no draft.

08:49.762 --> 08:51.264
Tell me about it then.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.967
Right now?

08:55.034 --> 08:58.337
Or we can meet later.

08:58.404 --> 09:01.274
We can tell me
over coffee or dinner.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.275
How do you like that?

09:04.810 --> 09:07.613
I'll work something out
and I'll let you know.

09:08.748 --> 09:11.651
-Fine, let me know.
-Sure.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.329
Are you on the train?
I need to talk to you urgently.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.463
Call me when you can.

09:26.499 --> 09:27.733
Damn!

09:36.542 --> 09:39.779
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

09:41.013 --> 09:42.281
I'm so dumb.

09:46.185 --> 09:48.821
Cutini's zoo used to be here.
Did you know that?

09:49.322 --> 09:50.723
It was a gold mine.

09:51.824 --> 09:52.992
Until a boy tried to feed
a bear.

09:53.392 --> 09:55.361
And it torn his arm off.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.498
Thirty years have passed.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.969
There are people who say
they still see...

10:03.035 --> 10:04.437
loose animals out there.

10:05.905 --> 10:09.875
Deers, guanacos...
Those damn animals.

10:10.810 --> 10:11.978
Did you also buy this land?

10:13.980 --> 10:16.082
Who is the driver in the video?

10:16.482 --> 10:17.783
Lucio Valrossa.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.953
And the girl?
She's very nice.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.922
Verónica Rosenthal.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.457
Rosenthal...

10:24.523 --> 10:26.225
A Jewish girl, a reporter.

10:26.592 --> 10:28.327
It rings a bell to me.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.763
Her father is a lawyer.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.335
-What do we do now?
-Nothing.

10:37.603 --> 10:40.406
-We must stay alert.
-Nothing?

10:41.273 --> 10:42.441
Nothing for the time being.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.350
What happened to the bear
who tore the boy's arm off?

10:51.417 --> 10:54.420
-He became a carpet.
-Of course.

10:57.056 --> 11:00.393
That shouldn't have happened.
Cutini was an idiot.

11:00.793 --> 11:03.562
If you give food to a bear
and he'll eat up your hand.

11:08.801 --> 11:14.073
Perfect.
Thanks a lot. Bye.

11:21.447 --> 11:22.481
Did you finally rent anything?

11:22.815 --> 11:25.518
No way! Real state agencies
ask for a fortune.

11:25.584 --> 11:28.521
And owners don't rent
to unregistered employees.

11:28.587 --> 11:29.822
Those problems are solved
with money.

11:30.156 --> 11:31.624
I don't have any.

11:31.957 --> 11:33.359
-You could have a lot.
-How?

11:33.759 --> 11:36.295
You have a good eye.
You know what I need.

11:37.296 --> 11:38.564
Peque is wonderful.

11:38.998 --> 11:40.266
What you gave me
for finding Peque...

11:40.332 --> 11:42.535
was not enough
to pay for the downpayment.

11:42.601 --> 11:44.570
Find me another one like Peque
and I'll help you out.

11:55.014 --> 11:56.282
How is your father?

11:57.583 --> 11:59.819
Do you really want
to talk about my father?

12:00.152 --> 12:02.054
I love him, I want to know
how he is doing.

12:03.055 --> 12:06.025
-Tell me.
-He is fine.

12:07.026 --> 12:09.295
He is coming home this week,
together with my sisters.

12:09.361 --> 12:10.863
What is the occasion?

12:11.397 --> 12:13.733
It's my mother's
death anniversary.

12:15.668 --> 12:19.638
-How long ago was it?
-Five years.

12:21.974 --> 12:25.277
-You must be careful.
-Why?

12:26.045 --> 12:29.482
He'll see the panel on the wall
and he'll get worried.

12:29.548 --> 12:31.217
He'll think you are obsessed.

12:32.017 --> 12:34.820
Well, you are.
Very much obsessed.

12:34.887 --> 12:37.189
How are you, Vero?
Where are you?

12:37.990 --> 12:40.659
It's Thursday night.
You must be at Paula's bar.

12:41.293 --> 12:43.095
I've got some information
for you.

12:43.162 --> 12:44.463
Tell me what you want
me to do about it.

12:52.872 --> 12:56.142
I learned something
about Jonathan, the survivor.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.810
I talked to Romanín.

12:58.844 --> 13:01.614
He gave me the name
of the train driver.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.316
Carlos Romero.
Here is a picture of him.

13:18.364 --> 13:19.698
What?

13:19.765 --> 13:20.599
I have a friend who works
at the Federal Shooting Range.

13:22.067 --> 13:24.470
-I phoned him about the gun.
-What gun?

13:24.904 --> 13:26.272
-Come on, Vero.
-Okay, I know.

13:26.605 --> 13:29.275
I felt uneasy about that.
I asked him about it.

13:30.209 --> 13:33.078
Do you know they keep records
of all the guns used there?

13:33.145 --> 13:35.648
Yes, I do.
So?

13:36.382 --> 13:37.750
So?

13:42.688 --> 13:43.756
What is this?

13:43.823 --> 13:46.992
A record.
With dates and times.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.162
Valrossa went there
several times.

13:50.229 --> 13:51.463
To practise shooting
with his gun.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.703
He told me he had never
gone practising.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.305
He didn't even remember
he had that gun.

13:59.638 --> 14:02.341
He must have poor memory.
He went there many times.

15:00.933 --> 15:03.936
Hey, Rafa!

15:11.443 --> 15:14.914
-How are you?
-Fine. And you?

15:14.980 --> 15:17.383
-Do you remember Pizza?
-Hi, Pizza.

15:17.716 --> 15:18.851
-How are you?
-Fine.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.086
Why didn't you come over
the other night?

15:21.153 --> 15:23.389
I told you I couldn't.

15:23.455 --> 15:25.424
Don't worry.
It's okay.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.226
Today's is Piazza's
sister's birthday.

15:27.293 --> 15:28.928
-Why don't you come?
-That'll be great.

15:28.994 --> 15:31.363
-I don't think I can go.
-Come on!

15:31.430 --> 15:35.534
Do you want us to beg you?
It's an invitation.

15:37.202 --> 15:39.872
-Okay, but just for a while.
-Great.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.174
Bring something to drink.
Wine or beer.

15:43.475 --> 15:45.411
If you don't drop by,
we'll go fetch you.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.279
All right, see you.

16:01.727 --> 16:02.828
How are you?

16:02.895 --> 16:05.164
I met with Sandra,
Carranza's wife.

16:05.230 --> 16:06.699
She told me
she never talked to you.

16:06.765 --> 16:08.300
You told me something else.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.569
I didn't want to bother her.
I thought it was a bad time.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.504
You should've told me that.

16:12.571 --> 16:14.606
You said she didn't want
to see me instead.

16:15.908 --> 16:18.177
I also learned you went
to the Federal Shooting Range.

16:18.243 --> 16:19.311
You practised there many times.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.047
With the gun you told me
you didn't remember having.

16:23.215 --> 16:24.984
Are you married?
Do you have children?

16:25.050 --> 16:26.118
Is that true?

16:26.185 --> 16:27.319
I'm married, I have children...

16:27.386 --> 16:28.320
and I went
to the Federal Shooting Range.

16:28.387 --> 16:29.822
What for?

16:29.888 --> 16:32.992
To take my mind off things.
You concentrate, aim and fire.

16:33.058 --> 16:34.493
It's a soothing activity.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.662
Fishing and yoga
are soothing activities.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.230
Not shooting bullets.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.001
Why did you lie to me?

16:43.235 --> 16:44.570
Because you are a reporter.

16:45.537 --> 16:46.839
I'm just getting to know you.

16:47.606 --> 16:48.874
Did you give him the gun?

16:49.274 --> 16:52.144
-You like repeating questions.
-Did you?

16:52.211 --> 16:53.479
I told you I didn't.

16:54.613 --> 16:56.882
There were seven accidents
involving children...

16:56.949 --> 16:58.083
in the last five years.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.786
Six of them died,
only one survived.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.188
The driver that day
was Carlos Romero.

17:04.123 --> 17:08.160
Do you know him?
Personally?

17:08.227 --> 17:09.395
I want to meet him.

17:09.461 --> 17:10.763
I want him to tell me
what happened.

17:10.829 --> 17:13.832
-You know what happened.
-Yes, but I want to know more.

17:15.401 --> 17:18.203
You don't seem to understand.
There are children involved.

17:18.270 --> 17:21.540
You have children, Lucio.
I can't believe you don't care.

17:23.609 --> 17:26.745
-What are you laughing at?
-You are so funny.

17:26.812 --> 17:28.947
-Why?
-What children?

17:30.115 --> 17:31.884
You only care about yourself.

17:34.453 --> 17:35.788
You are an asshole.

17:38.657 --> 17:40.192
My shift is about to start.

18:12.825 --> 18:13.725
Hello?

18:14.393 --> 18:15.461
How are you feeling?

18:16.795 --> 18:18.130
Not too well.

18:18.197 --> 18:19.765
I didn't like
how it all ended today.

18:19.832 --> 18:20.833
Neither did I.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.002
But I'm partly right, am I not?

18:25.337 --> 18:26.538
Partly.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.108
What happens?

18:30.809 --> 18:31.944
Nothing.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.947
It bothers me
that you know me so well.

18:35.013 --> 18:36.615
That you get me figured out.

18:37.549 --> 18:39.318
It makes me feel miserable.

18:40.752 --> 18:43.088
I think you do it all for you.

18:45.491 --> 18:49.128
But it is all right too.
It is valuable research.

18:49.194 --> 18:50.696
You didn't say that today.

18:50.762 --> 18:55.134
I was a bit upset.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.069
Upset?

18:58.837 --> 19:00.205
Like crazy?

19:01.874 --> 19:03.242
Yes, crazy about you.

19:05.244 --> 19:06.778
Come here and I'll show you.

19:07.613 --> 19:08.480
Where to?

19:09.148 --> 19:10.482
To the driver's compartment.

19:13.785 --> 19:16.488
You wanted to have sex.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.161
Guess what I'm wearing.

19:27.232 --> 19:28.233
Shorts?

19:30.335 --> 19:31.336
And below?

19:32.671 --> 19:33.739
Nothing.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.209
You are a bad boy.

19:43.415 --> 19:44.816
Guess what I am doing.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.220
You're touching yourself.

19:53.458 --> 19:54.726
Are you in a hurry?

19:57.129 --> 20:01.733
You're arriving at the station.
I know you too. You see?

20:05.504 --> 20:06.738
Really?

20:09.141 --> 20:10.409
What am I thinking?

20:11.510 --> 20:13.045
You want me to eat your mouth.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.449
What are you doing?

20:18.383 --> 20:19.685
What do you want me to do?

20:20.886 --> 20:22.788
Put your hand under my shorts.

20:25.524 --> 20:27.192
Push hard.

20:28.126 --> 20:29.428
Is that okay?

20:30.529 --> 20:33.565
Yes. Now bite me.

20:35.801 --> 20:36.868
Where?

20:37.402 --> 20:38.503
My neck.

20:38.837 --> 20:40.339
Is this okay?

20:43.609 --> 20:44.910
Now the breasts.

20:46.612 --> 20:48.547
The nipples, right?

20:48.614 --> 20:49.615
Keep going down.

20:49.948 --> 20:53.418
I'll go down.
Is that okay?

20:55.287 --> 20:56.722
Get it in, Lucio.

20:59.725 --> 21:01.426
Fuck me!

21:04.263 --> 21:06.965
Do you like it this way?
Harder?

21:07.599 --> 21:08.900
Yes.

21:21.146 --> 21:22.114
Damn!

21:24.750 --> 21:25.784
What happened?

21:25.851 --> 21:27.953
I have to go.
The bell's ringing.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.925
Call me tomorrow, will you?

21:37.162 --> 21:38.196
Bye.

21:56.248 --> 21:58.717
Marisa told me
you went to see her.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.852
Yes, she is lovely.
She helped me a lot.

22:00.919 --> 22:01.987
About the trains?

22:03.555 --> 22:06.825
-Yes.
-Federico told me.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.161
Yes, about that.

22:09.227 --> 22:10.762
How much time do you have
to hand in a story?

22:11.129 --> 22:12.998
Do you have a deadline?

22:13.065 --> 22:15.033
Sometimes you do.
It depends.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.201
Some stories take longer
than others.

22:16.535 --> 22:18.937
Some stories must be
more difficult than others.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.106
And some reporters are
more dedicated than others.

22:21.473 --> 22:23.041
It depends on several things.

22:23.375 --> 22:26.311
-What is this story about?
-She's just said it.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.715
Something about trains.
What in particular?

22:30.082 --> 22:31.283
I'd rather not talk
much about it.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.518
Children hit by trains.

22:33.585 --> 22:37.122
-The boy is listening, dad!
-I'm sorry.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.825
It's not just that.
There is much more to it.

22:40.459 --> 22:41.893
What else?

22:42.527 --> 22:43.862
I don't know.
But there is a lot more.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.997
If you don't know,
so far it's about...

22:46.064 --> 22:48.233
children hit by trains, honey.

22:49.167 --> 22:50.969
I'm done.
Can I go play?

22:51.036 --> 22:53.839
Have you had enough?

22:54.272 --> 22:56.141
Sure?
Okay, you can go.

22:59.711 --> 23:01.780
I've got you some candy.

23:06.651 --> 23:08.019
What are you upset about?

23:08.353 --> 23:10.889
Me?
About nothing.

23:11.423 --> 23:12.891
You seem to be upset
about something.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.060
Did I say something wrong?

23:15.127 --> 23:17.028
It is not what you say
but the tone you use.

23:17.095 --> 23:19.498
-What tone, honey?
-That damn tone of yours.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.199
Stop it, Verónica!

23:23.902 --> 23:26.238
Who is this, auntie?

23:27.773 --> 23:28.874
A friend of mine.

23:28.940 --> 23:31.109
Look, dad.
Is this from Rayo Vallecano?

23:31.176 --> 23:32.210
Let me see.

23:33.311 --> 23:35.914
Yes, exactly.
Rayo Vallecano.

23:36.314 --> 23:38.817
The Spanish team.
But look closer.

23:40.886 --> 23:42.788
His t-shirt reads
Rayito Vallecano.

23:46.057 --> 23:48.393
Can I see it?

23:48.994 --> 23:50.562
Rayito Vallecano...

23:53.632 --> 23:55.867
He used to play so well.

23:56.268 --> 23:59.171
Yes, he should've been
in the major leagues.

23:59.538 --> 24:01.440
We would all be rich now.

24:01.773 --> 24:03.341
Do you remember
that unforgettable match?

24:03.742 --> 24:05.944
-Do you remember it?
-Yes, I was there.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.447
He stopped the ball
in the middle of the field.

24:08.847 --> 24:12.083
He kicked it over the goal.
Too bad he's such a mess.

24:12.417 --> 24:13.652
We could be in Europe
enjoying the good stuff.

24:13.985 --> 24:16.121
Not this damn thing!
Where did you buy it?

24:17.055 --> 24:18.089
At the usual place.

24:18.156 --> 24:19.825
I told you
not to go there anymore.

24:23.562 --> 24:25.197
There you are.

24:25.530 --> 24:28.467
Here is some for you, girls.

24:28.533 --> 24:29.835
How long have you been clean?

24:30.202 --> 24:31.636
Seven months.

24:31.703 --> 24:33.271
It must be hard for you
to resist, right?

25:22.153 --> 25:23.655
What are you doing, punk?

25:23.722 --> 25:26.057
Shut up, idiot.
I'll beat you up.

25:26.958 --> 25:28.093
Damn you!

25:31.963 --> 25:32.898
What are you looking at?

25:33.632 --> 25:34.566
Go to hell!

25:38.103 --> 25:41.406
Yes, Nahuel.
I remember him very well.

25:41.740 --> 25:45.243
A good boy.
A bit rough for soccer.

25:45.610 --> 25:49.047
Good-hearted.
He must be in one of these.

25:51.683 --> 25:52.751
Do you know what happened
to him?

25:53.084 --> 25:55.620
I haven't seen him
for a long time.

25:55.954 --> 25:58.356
He stopped coming
about a year ago.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.258
What happened to him?

26:01.393 --> 26:04.296
He was hit by a train.
He died.

26:10.101 --> 26:12.470
Here he is.

26:14.539 --> 26:16.474
Why did the stop coming?

26:18.243 --> 26:19.377
He kicked
all the other players.

26:19.711 --> 26:21.413
He was sent to the bench
every time.

26:22.113 --> 26:26.084
His category was overcrowded.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.652
He rarely got to play.

26:27.986 --> 26:31.022
He used to live in a slum,
Los Piletones.

26:31.356 --> 26:33.525
I don't know.

26:33.858 --> 26:36.861
They fill out a form
when they start playing.

26:37.195 --> 26:39.831
But when they stop playing,
we tear it off.

26:40.932 --> 26:43.768
Could he have gone
to another club?

26:44.135 --> 26:46.905
Yes, there are many soccer
clubs in this area.

26:47.238 --> 26:52.310
Could be.
Was it an accident?

27:06.758 --> 27:09.361
Come here, Peque.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.732
Raise hell.

27:15.500 --> 27:17.002
With the new guy.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.077
Hey, you!

27:28.847 --> 27:30.682
Come on!
Keep playing, ladies.

27:43.928 --> 27:44.996
This is for you.
It's 5,000 pesos.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.564
Thanks a lot.

27:46.631 --> 27:47.966
You did your job well.
I said I'd help you out.

27:48.033 --> 27:49.234
I've got enough
to make a downpayment.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.870
Give some coke to the new boy.
It's on the house.

27:51.936 --> 27:54.806
-Thanks, Rivero.
-What is it, Peque?

27:54.873 --> 27:56.441
When is the next competition?

27:56.875 --> 27:59.310
-You ran out of money yet?
-That's my business.

27:59.644 --> 28:01.746
I don't set the dates
of the competitions.

28:02.947 --> 28:04.349
Don't worry.
It will be soon enough.

28:04.416 --> 28:05.817
Will it be
against Cholito again?

28:05.884 --> 28:08.887
No, he lost. He is out.
It's like a golden goal.

28:08.953 --> 28:10.689
If you lose, you are out.

28:10.755 --> 28:12.424
-I'm not gonna lose.
-Great.

28:12.791 --> 28:15.293
I want more money.
Last time you gave me peanuts.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.594
Come on!

28:16.661 --> 28:19.297
I saw many people there.
I want at least 2,000.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.532
Do you know how much that is?

28:20.865 --> 28:22.300
There is no competition then.

28:26.771 --> 28:28.940
I'll see what I can do.
Go practise now.

29:11.049 --> 29:13.051
-Catch her!
-No! Wait!

29:13.451 --> 29:16.855
-Give me your bag!
-No! Wait!

29:21.960 --> 29:23.728
Damn!

29:40.211 --> 29:43.414
You're so silly!
Don't forget about the tires.

29:43.815 --> 29:45.083
What tires?

29:45.984 --> 29:47.752
Are you kidding me?

29:48.186 --> 29:52.123
I walked by the shop yesterday
and they were lying there.

29:52.757 --> 29:56.528
If the guy buys another dog,
we will be doomed.

29:58.997 --> 30:00.698
I don't care.
I have another competition.

30:01.099 --> 30:02.467
-When?
-I don't know.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.369
But I'll have another one.
Because I won.

30:04.702 --> 30:07.372
And if I win this one,
I'll get 2,000.

30:08.940 --> 30:11.109
-Is it about soccer?
-It's about being brave.

30:11.176 --> 30:12.777
Stop it.
I can't tell you anything else.

30:13.211 --> 30:14.312
You compete against another boy?

30:14.646 --> 30:16.815
Of course.
Against Cholito.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.149
The guy you met at the club.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.852
He lost.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.221
So he can't compete anymore.

30:23.955 --> 30:24.889
He is out.

30:25.223 --> 30:26.691
Why don't you compete
against me?

30:26.758 --> 30:28.426
No matter who wins,
we'll split the money.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.695
-It is convenient, isn't it?
-Could be.

30:31.129 --> 30:32.630
Sure.

30:34.098 --> 30:36.634
Let me compete first
and then we'll see.

30:37.068 --> 30:38.536
Okay.

30:42.807 --> 30:44.209
Give me some.

30:46.945 --> 30:48.880
I'll come back quickly.
It is not far away.

30:48.947 --> 30:50.381
You're kidding me?
It's at the end of the world.

30:50.448 --> 30:53.785
Can I have your mobile number?
My phone was stolen.

30:53.852 --> 30:54.886
What happened?

30:54.953 --> 30:55.987
Nothing.
It is a long story.

30:56.054 --> 30:58.122
I'll send it to you
through Whatsapp.

30:59.624 --> 31:02.894
-Don't smoke in the car.
-I won't. Thanks.

31:04.429 --> 31:06.064
Stretch it a bit more.

31:06.497 --> 31:08.333
So there will be fewer wrinkles.

31:08.666 --> 31:11.536
That means less ironing. Did
you put a clothes' pin there?

31:11.603 --> 31:14.172
-Yes, I got it.
-And now this one.

31:15.106 --> 31:17.809
-Here?
-Yes, stretch it.

31:18.643 --> 31:20.712
-Perfect.
-Hello.

31:22.780 --> 31:24.782
-I've brought you this.
-Thanks, dad.

31:24.849 --> 31:26.150
-How are you?
-Fine.

31:26.885 --> 31:30.288
Can I have a word with your mom?

31:32.090 --> 31:33.291
What are you doing here?
What do you want?

31:34.492 --> 31:35.860
I am moving out.

31:37.128 --> 31:38.596
To an apartment near here.

31:39.097 --> 31:40.231
It is small.
A studio.

31:40.565 --> 31:44.435
I can put a partition
and a bed for Martina.

31:44.502 --> 31:47.038
Why are you doing this to me,
Rafael?

31:47.105 --> 31:50.742
I am not doing anything to you.
I only want to be with Martina.

31:50.808 --> 31:54.279
I want her to visit me.
I want her to have a room.

31:54.345 --> 31:55.947
I don't want to argue.

31:57.282 --> 31:59.417
I know you.
I know you'll insist.

32:00.618 --> 32:03.288
Fine, move
to your new apartment.

32:03.354 --> 32:05.356
Have a room for Martina.
Do what you want.

32:05.690 --> 32:08.927
But listen to me.
I'll be watching you.

32:09.260 --> 32:12.597
And if you screw up,
even once,

32:12.664 --> 32:15.300
I swear on my life
you won't see her again.

32:17.402 --> 32:20.004
-Thanks.
-Go to hell.

32:30.148 --> 32:31.549
Your father got you only one?

32:34.519 --> 32:36.688
How are you, Peque?

32:36.754 --> 32:38.356
What are you doing here?
Has Rivero sent you?

32:38.423 --> 32:40.191
-He is my father.
-I am Martina's father.

32:41.693 --> 32:43.127
Where did you two meet?

32:43.194 --> 32:45.897
Peque is one of the club's
best defenders.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.098
The club where I work.

32:47.665 --> 32:49.133
Yes, your father got me there.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.368
I saw him play in the park.

32:50.435 --> 32:51.769
I told him
he could take a test.

32:52.370 --> 32:53.438
I have to leave, honey.

32:54.105 --> 32:55.373
Go inside.
You mother is looking for you.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.608
-Will I see you again?
-Yes, you will.

32:59.277 --> 33:01.980
-Bye, dad. I love you.
-Me too.

33:02.680 --> 33:03.815
See you tomorrow.

33:07.185 --> 33:08.920
-Ask him.
-What?

33:08.987 --> 33:10.254
If I can compete against you.

33:10.621 --> 33:11.756
I don't know
if he knows about that.

33:12.757 --> 33:14.292
Of course he does.

33:48.126 --> 33:49.794
Are you Mr. Corso?

33:51.162 --> 33:52.764
Who wants to know?

33:54.165 --> 33:55.833
My name is Verónica Rosenthal.

33:55.900 --> 33:56.968
At the police station
they told me...

33:57.035 --> 33:58.269
I could find you here.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.605
A reporter.

34:01.272 --> 34:02.740
How could you tell?

34:05.043 --> 34:06.477
I work for "Nuestro Tiempo".

34:07.512 --> 34:09.580
-A newspaper?
-No, a magazine.

34:10.248 --> 34:11.516
I don't know it.

34:13.017 --> 34:16.921
My mother loved puzzles.
We made them together.

34:20.658 --> 34:22.593
-Can we talk?
-About what?

34:23.594 --> 34:24.962
About Alberto Lete.

34:26.664 --> 34:28.099
Who is he?

34:28.766 --> 34:30.301
You know.

34:31.169 --> 34:33.271
I was a sergeant in those days.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.973
I was about to become
a lieutenant.

34:37.108 --> 34:38.376
One day we got a call.

34:38.709 --> 34:41.379
There was a boy
lying at a railway crossing.

34:41.779 --> 34:44.248
He seemed to be dead.

34:44.315 --> 34:46.417
But he was breathing.

34:46.484 --> 34:47.752
So I called an ambulance.

34:47.819 --> 34:49.153
And they took him
to Clínicas hospital.

34:51.022 --> 34:53.191
The report says
he was hit by a car.

34:53.257 --> 34:56.561
-That he was drunk.
-Not my report.

34:56.627 --> 34:58.529
Who changed it then?

34:58.963 --> 35:00.131
I don't know.

35:00.465 --> 35:03.267
When I tried to find out,
my house got shot.

35:03.634 --> 35:06.170
Being a policeman,
I couldn't stand that.

35:06.571 --> 35:08.906
It seemed to be something big.

35:10.074 --> 35:12.276
I was too old to fight.

35:12.844 --> 35:14.612
So I asked to be discharged
and moved out here.

35:16.614 --> 35:17.915
But you never forgot it.

35:19.550 --> 35:20.785
Unfortunately, I didn't.

35:22.253 --> 35:24.722
I don't know
what you want to know.

35:25.656 --> 35:26.991
But be careful.

35:27.558 --> 35:29.694
I don't know what
this guy Lete knows either.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.129
But try not to end up like him.

35:34.532 --> 35:37.101
-Where should I go?
-You're asking me?

35:37.835 --> 35:41.639
I just don't know.
Try the "head" of the district.

35:43.007 --> 35:45.843
Nothing gets done
without his approval.

35:45.910 --> 35:47.411
Who is the head?
The police chief?

35:48.779 --> 35:50.348
Sometimes it is him.
Sometimes it isn't him.

35:50.681 --> 35:53.584
It should be the same person
who did it in your days.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.554
-Or maybe not.
-What about if he is?

35:59.190 --> 36:00.758
He is said to be
a wealthy guy.

36:01.959 --> 36:05.163
Who comes from Santa Rosa,
La Pampa.

36:05.596 --> 36:08.399
He runs some casinos
and deals with illegal gambling.

36:08.766 --> 36:11.335
These guys never show
their face.

36:12.904 --> 36:18.042
No, until someone shows it.

36:29.086 --> 36:31.389
Peque? Come here.

36:37.695 --> 36:38.796
It is today.
Can you make it?

36:39.130 --> 36:40.231
Of course.

36:41.332 --> 36:44.402
-Same place as before?
-Same place.

36:45.303 --> 36:46.537
Against who?

36:47.738 --> 36:49.340
I never give names.
But to you, I will.

36:49.941 --> 36:51.142
Vincen.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.410
You may know him.
He plays in another category.

36:52.476 --> 36:53.377
Older or younger?

36:53.744 --> 36:55.346
One or two years younger.

36:55.413 --> 36:56.547
But he seems older.
He is big.

36:56.948 --> 36:59.283
-Is he a champion?
-Yes, like you.

37:00.117 --> 37:01.352
What about the money?

37:02.186 --> 37:06.123
I may not get you 2,000,
but hopefully 1,000.

37:06.190 --> 37:08.859
-You must win, of course.
-I will.

37:09.460 --> 37:10.795
Go now.

37:27.445 --> 37:31.482
-Peque is doing very well.
-I am glad to hear that.

37:32.283 --> 37:33.684
He doesn't talk much,
but he has determination.

37:34.852 --> 37:36.320
How is he doing
here at the club?

37:36.654 --> 37:37.788
He is very enthusiastic.

37:38.155 --> 37:39.657
My daughter says he is happy.

37:42.994 --> 37:44.495
Your daughter?

37:44.562 --> 37:46.597
They live
in the same boarding house.

37:51.002 --> 37:52.670
Is there something wrong?

37:54.372 --> 37:55.906
No, nothing.

39:26.030 --> 39:26.931
Hello?

39:27.431 --> 39:28.466
Where are you?

39:28.532 --> 39:31.035
Far away.
Are you working tonight?

39:32.069 --> 39:34.472
No, it is my day off.
I'd like to see you.

39:35.005 --> 39:36.474
I can be in town in an hour.

39:37.641 --> 39:39.009
Where shall we meet?

39:40.010 --> 39:42.780
At my place.
I'll text you the address.

39:43.714 --> 39:45.916
-Fine.
-Bye.

40:35.733 --> 40:38.235
It is such a long time
since I don't collect stamps.

40:39.403 --> 40:41.739
-What championship is it?
-World Cup 1978.

40:42.873 --> 40:45.509
-Can I see them?
-No, they were my father's.

43:12.556 --> 43:16.760
-Is that your mom?
-Yes.

43:18.729 --> 43:21.365
She died five years ago.
Lung cancer.

43:27.137 --> 43:29.707
Did you know our last names
mean the same?

43:31.875 --> 43:33.477
Valrossa and Rosenthal.

43:34.411 --> 43:36.947
Both mean "valley of roses".

43:56.367 --> 43:57.701
It is a friend.
Stay here, please.

43:58.836 --> 44:00.170
What shall I do?
Get into the closet?

44:01.305 --> 44:04.441
No, you silly.
Keep quiet.

44:10.648 --> 44:14.451
There are some numbers
I don't like.

44:21.158 --> 44:22.326
What shall we do now?

44:23.861 --> 44:25.229
Make the call.

44:26.030 --> 44:27.631
Tell them to be careful.

44:31.535 --> 44:35.539
-A problem.
-Something wrong?

44:38.509 --> 44:41.445
I marked the addresses
of the seven kids on the map.

44:41.779 --> 44:43.280
All the accidents
were in the suburbs.

44:43.347 --> 44:44.448
But they all lived in town.

44:44.515 --> 44:45.649
Exactly.
They were almost neighbors.

44:46.316 --> 44:49.319
Soldati.
What is this?

44:49.753 --> 44:53.323
-Villa Riachuelo.
-Lugano, Piedrabuena.

44:53.390 --> 44:54.591
Lugano again.

44:56.060 --> 44:58.562
-What district is it?
-I think it is District Eight.

44:58.929 --> 45:01.932
District Eight...
And Los Piletones?

45:03.333 --> 45:05.369
District...Eight.

45:07.971 --> 45:09.940
Are you with someone?
I'll go away.

45:10.007 --> 45:11.842
No, don't go away.

45:11.909 --> 45:14.278
I was just told a co-worker
hit another boy.

45:15.212 --> 45:16.346
Let me out, please.

45:17.648 --> 45:20.017
Damn!
Come on.

45:48.879 --> 45:50.180
You have work to do.

45:56.487 --> 45:57.721
Don't worry.
