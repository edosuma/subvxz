00:01.218 --> 00:04.439
<i>Previously on "The Real
Housewives of Salt Lake City"...</i>

00:06.093 --> 00:06.267
Pay that rent, pay that rent,

00:07.007 --> 00:08.660
You're paying that rent. Yes!

00:08.660 --> 00:11.141
One of the biggest wounds I have
is the Church,

00:11.141 --> 00:14.840
and I'm ready to close
that chapter.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.277
Jen, how are you feeling?

00:16.277 --> 00:18.496
Like, a full-on anxiety attack
this morning

00:18.496 --> 00:20.803
'cause I have to, like,
actually fly to New York.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.457
Are you going through discovery?

00:22.457 --> 00:25.329
We are going to do another
mock trial while I'm there.

00:25.329 --> 00:28.680
I was
in a very abusive situation,

00:28.680 --> 00:32.510
but I, like, stuffed it so deep
that I blocked all memory of it.

00:34.295 --> 00:37.863
Angie told us Lisa sleeps
with [bleep],

00:37.863 --> 00:40.083
and you were there.
- I did not hear it.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.432
You were there.

00:41.432 --> 00:43.521
I'm really hurt by Heather.

00:43.521 --> 00:46.611
She's the person who I'd expect
to be there for me.

00:46.611 --> 00:49.571
Maybe Heather doesn't give
a [bleep] about me.

00:49.571 --> 00:51.747
Truth seeker?
That's not a true thing.

00:51.747 --> 00:54.706
Not rumors and bullsh--
that she says is not true.

00:54.706 --> 00:56.360
Oh, my God.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.580
You are up a river
with no paddle. Stop!

01:02.366 --> 01:05.369
<i>I'm fighting for my life,
not your approval.</i>

01:07.371 --> 01:08.677
<i>I am more of a free spirit</i>

01:08.677 --> 01:10.809
<i>without the Holy Spirit.</i>

01:13.247 --> 01:14.770
<i>I'll always have your back</i>

01:14.770 --> 01:18.339
<i>if you stop stabbing me
in mine.</i>

01:18.339 --> 01:21.820
<i>When I take a shot,
I always hit my mark.</i>

01:23.431 --> 01:24.736
<i>I may be a bad Mormon,</i>

01:24.736 --> 01:28.523
<i>but I'll always be a good time.</i>

01:46.149 --> 01:48.543
Hi, baby, how are you?

01:48.543 --> 01:51.285
I miss you, too.
How's Omar doing?

01:51.285 --> 01:53.635
Oh, good. I'm so happy
I'll be home tonight.

01:53.635 --> 01:55.767
I can't wait to be home.

02:05.951 --> 02:08.824
- It's a gorgeous day. <i>
- Beautiful.</i>

02:08.824 --> 02:11.740
So you know,
Brooksy's coming in tomorrow.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.437
- Nice.
- Yeah.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.700
You really have told me
jack sh-- about your trip.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.399
It was chaotic,
not like Zion chaotic,

02:18.399 --> 02:20.444
but not that far off.

02:24.448 --> 02:27.408
Oh, my gosh. This feels
like it's gonna be hard.

02:27.408 --> 02:29.236
- Do I need to bend my knees?
- No.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.194
Oh--

02:31.194 --> 02:33.805
But if it's too easy, then
we can put--we can change it.

02:33.805 --> 02:38.245
Oh, no, it's hard.
Is this right? Is my form good?

02:38.245 --> 02:39.811
Yeah, it's great.

02:39.811 --> 02:41.552
So did you guys miss me
while I was gone?

02:41.552 --> 02:43.293
You could say that.

02:43.293 --> 02:44.947
- John.
- Those phone calls were rough.

02:47.341 --> 02:50.648
John, they just said I'm having
an affair with [bleep].

02:50.648 --> 02:53.782
Disgusting! He's laughing.

02:53.782 --> 02:57.002
Angie H. is the one that started
this rumor because--

02:57.002 --> 02:59.396
- That was a setup.
- Yeah, that's a--Yeah.

02:59.396 --> 03:01.006
No marriage is perfect,

03:01.006 --> 03:03.008
however, there is no question
in my mind

03:03.008 --> 03:04.619
that there is any validity
to those rumors,

03:04.619 --> 03:07.709
especially when you consider
the lies Angie created

03:07.709 --> 03:10.842
as far as
the whole catering debacle.

03:10.842 --> 03:12.540
I got a call from the caterers,

03:12.540 --> 03:14.498
and they were like,
"We have to pull out."

03:14.498 --> 03:16.283
This has nothing to do with me.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.023
Everyone around me
thinks you're involved.

03:18.023 --> 03:20.287
This is unreal.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.506
She's a pathological liar,

03:22.506 --> 03:24.508
and this is where Whitney
won me over a little bit.

03:24.508 --> 03:27.424
What do I always tell our kids?
The bad truth is what?

03:27.424 --> 03:29.034
Better than a good lie.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.645
Yeah. She came in
with a bad truth

03:30.645 --> 03:34.692
that my "friends"
were talking behind my back,

03:34.692 --> 03:36.607
and she didn't feel
good about it,

03:36.607 --> 03:38.566
and her guilt kicked in,
and I feel like

03:38.566 --> 03:40.524
I saw Whitney
in a different way,

03:40.524 --> 03:42.700
and I'm like, wow,
this is being my friend.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.399
And as awful as
the message was...

03:45.399 --> 03:47.662
She still did it.
She still delivered it, yeah.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.446
She said it,
and I gave her, like,

03:49.446 --> 03:53.581
I will always give her credit
for, like, saying the bad truth.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.594
How'd you sleep?

04:10.293 --> 04:11.947
- Tired?
- I'm tired.

04:11.947 --> 04:14.341
I am still recovering
from Phoenix,

04:14.341 --> 04:15.690
'cause day drinking all day,

04:15.690 --> 04:18.867
and then the emotional wreck
I became.

04:18.867 --> 04:21.739
It's only been a few days.

04:21.739 --> 04:25.395
Thank God I have reconnected
with Curtis and Kelli,

04:25.395 --> 04:28.659
'cause they've been
a missing piece of my life,

04:28.659 --> 04:29.834
don't you think? Like--
- I think it's--Yeah.

04:29.834 --> 04:32.054
They feel so good to me.

04:32.054 --> 04:35.013
I hate that we didn't have
a connection growing up.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.928
- We're connected.
- No, we did. We did.

04:36.928 --> 04:38.582
Like, I just realized,

04:38.582 --> 04:40.889
even though our situations
are probably different,

04:40.889 --> 04:42.020
the feeling's the same.

04:44.066 --> 04:48.026
For what they've gone through,
and where they are now,

04:48.026 --> 04:50.115
I think they're a great example
of what can be.

04:50.115 --> 04:51.987
Mm-hmm.

04:51.987 --> 04:55.425
My healing journey is not over.
I have a long road ahead.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.775
But I realized after spending
time with Curtis and Kelli,

04:57.775 --> 05:00.778
it's time to leave the past
in the past.

05:00.778 --> 05:05.130
So I'm gonna continue to work
with my energy healer,

05:05.130 --> 05:10.701
and I'm gonna look into therapy
for PTSD and overcoming trauma.

05:10.701 --> 05:12.007
And with Heather, I'm just
trying to reconcile right now,

05:12.007 --> 05:15.445
like, in a moment of conflict,

05:15.445 --> 05:18.970
that Lisa and Jen
would stand up for me,

05:18.970 --> 05:21.016
and Heather wouldn't.

05:21.016 --> 05:23.758
I could feel the emotion
the night you called me.

05:23.758 --> 05:27.370
- Justin. <i>
- What's going on?</i>

05:27.370 --> 05:31.374
Heather just denied ever
talking sh-- about Lisa

05:31.374 --> 05:34.464
or that Angie has told us... anything.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.945
'Cause if you connect the dots
of why it hurt so much,

05:36.945 --> 05:38.468
it's because she didn't hear me.

05:38.468 --> 05:41.515
I didn't have a voice
in that situation.

05:41.515 --> 05:45.780
And that is how I spent
my entire childhood,

05:45.780 --> 05:48.783
and I don't think
that she realizes that,

05:48.783 --> 05:53.918
like, in that moment...
it triggered that.

06:08.759 --> 06:09.934
OMG!

06:09.934 --> 06:11.849
Let me in.
It's freezing out there.

06:11.849 --> 06:13.024
It's freezing. Get your sweet
little ass in here.

06:13.024 --> 06:14.591
- Hi!
- How are you?

06:14.591 --> 06:16.637
- Good. How are you?
- Good.

06:16.637 --> 06:19.030
How do you feel about
a dirty martini?

06:19.030 --> 06:20.554
- I feel great.
- Please find yourself a seat.

06:20.554 --> 06:22.120
- And I--
- Oh, I will.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.035
- I'll just seat myself.
- Love you.

06:24.035 --> 06:25.080
Goodness.

06:29.519 --> 06:32.783
I never was a waitress,

06:32.783 --> 06:34.437
but I was a busser.

06:34.437 --> 06:35.917
The Playboy Bunny dip?
Oh, that's even more impressive.

06:35.917 --> 06:38.136
- This is the bowling dip.
- That's a lovely dip.

06:38.136 --> 06:40.835
Oh, the Pl--No, no, I know
the Playboy B--Hold on.

06:40.835 --> 06:42.576
- Let's see you do it.
- I watched a little about--

06:42.576 --> 06:45.448
The documentary about Hef?
Yep. Dip, dip. Go. Drop.

06:45.448 --> 06:46.971
Oh.

06:46.971 --> 06:49.496
Just a couple of
middle class girls acting fancy.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.193
Working girls acting fancy.
Wish I had my feathers on.

06:51.193 --> 06:52.716
- Oh.
- Damn it.

06:52.716 --> 06:55.937
- You're splashing right--
- I told you I wasn't a waitress.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.591
- How are you, dear?
- I'm good.

06:57.591 --> 07:01.072
I have much tea to talk about.

07:01.072 --> 07:03.031
- I'm already spilling, so...
- Spilling the martini tea.

07:03.031 --> 07:05.250
We are in--We are on brand.

07:05.250 --> 07:09.124
Liquid courage to unwind
from my girls trip

07:09.124 --> 07:11.779
and fill you in
on everything that went down.

07:11.779 --> 07:14.259
Arizona.
I'm dying to hear what happened.

07:14.259 --> 07:16.174
We had just kind of
gotten there.

07:16.174 --> 07:17.741
We'd had a great time.

07:17.741 --> 07:21.136
The last thing I expected
was for Whitney

07:21.136 --> 07:25.967
to come running, like,
into the kitchen, wild-eyed,

07:25.967 --> 07:29.927
just kind of came at me
and said, "Tell Lisa

07:29.927 --> 07:33.931
you heard Angie say that
Lisa performed sexual favors

07:33.931 --> 07:35.585
for courtside seats
at the Jazz."

07:35.585 --> 07:37.892
What?!

07:37.892 --> 07:40.764
And I was like,
"I never heard that."

07:40.764 --> 07:43.158
Did you ever say that to me
at the Jazz game?

07:43.158 --> 07:44.899
Never!

07:44.899 --> 07:46.683
Then where did Whitney
get that from?

07:46.683 --> 07:49.033
Let's just say it was true.
I would have never said that.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.861
I'm very, like, guarded
on what I say and do,

07:50.861 --> 07:52.994
especially in that setting.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.778
That's a business environment.

07:54.778 --> 07:57.868
Chris's company
has a courtside suite.

07:57.868 --> 08:00.218
End of story. Done.

08:00.218 --> 08:04.309
Do you think I want
another issue with Lisa Barlow

08:04.309 --> 08:08.009
as we sit here
in the salon gaslight?

08:08.009 --> 08:10.620
What is Whitney talking about?

08:10.620 --> 08:13.884
I don't know Whitney
to be a liar.

08:13.884 --> 08:15.886
I know Whitney to be
a pot stirrer,

08:15.886 --> 08:18.280
and I know Whitney
to be paranoid.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.803
It makes no sense.

08:19.803 --> 08:22.806
I hope it's not true,
but if it's true,

08:22.806 --> 08:24.199
whoever Lisa is hooking up with
must be a submissive

08:24.199 --> 08:26.331
'cause that's a--
that's a lot to deal with.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.815
So how are you guys right now?

08:31.815 --> 08:34.992
I'm fine. I wanna move on.
I'm not holding a grudge.

08:34.992 --> 08:37.212
I'm planning a ski day.
We're gonna go to Snowbasin.

08:37.212 --> 08:39.997
It's gonna be everybody.

08:39.997 --> 08:42.783
I'm putting together a ski day.
I texted you about it,

08:42.783 --> 08:45.525
and I just wanted to follow up
and see if you're down to go.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.658
Okay.

08:48.658 --> 08:50.573
- I want to invite you.
- Okay.

08:50.573 --> 08:53.315
My dear friend, I would like you
to wear something fabulous.

08:53.315 --> 08:54.751
I'm gonna invite
all of my cousins.

08:54.751 --> 08:57.188
I feel like skiing
is the perfect activity

08:57.188 --> 09:00.104
to kind of bridge that gap
with my cousins,

09:00.104 --> 09:02.106
especially
with the book coming out.

09:02.106 --> 09:03.760
I'm writing a book about leaving
the Mormon Church,

09:03.760 --> 09:05.849
and I've decided to call it
"Bad Mormon."

09:05.849 --> 09:07.895
Everything
that I'm writing about

09:07.895 --> 09:11.159
is a destructive path
based on the way we were raised,

09:11.159 --> 09:13.944
and I don't know how I feel.
I feel a little conflicted.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.860
I don't want my Mormon friends
to know that I, like,

09:16.860 --> 09:18.906
have had sex outside
of marriage. I'm terrified.

09:18.906 --> 09:21.952
Well, I think--
I think they know.

09:21.952 --> 09:27.828
I'm balancing... my true feelings
and my loyalties

09:27.828 --> 09:29.351
to my friends and my family.

09:31.048 --> 09:33.007
It has been incredibly healing

09:33.007 --> 09:35.052
to have my cousins
back in my life,

09:35.052 --> 09:36.837
but now I'm scared of the fact

09:36.837 --> 09:38.969
that I'm writing a book
called "Bad Mormon"

09:38.969 --> 09:40.667
is going to scare
my cousins away.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.059
I don't wanna expose
any secrets.

09:42.059 --> 09:43.844
I don't wanna hurt anyone.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.715
I just want the chance
to tell my story

09:45.715 --> 09:50.981
in hopes that someone else
will relate to it.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.766
Well, you know I'm there
for you.

09:52.766 --> 09:55.725
But, like, what am I supposed
to do with Whitney?

09:55.725 --> 09:59.642
I just wanna believe
that she's mistaken.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.862
No, she was very clear
that you said it, I heard it,

10:01.862 --> 10:04.212
and if we said otherwise,
we were lying.

10:04.212 --> 10:05.256
Okay.

10:07.128 --> 10:08.651
Mmm.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.218
<i>Coming up...</i>

10:10.218 --> 10:13.090
The judge is pushing the trial
out till July.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.397
Our time is coming.

10:26.451 --> 10:27.191
Small plates and drinks.

10:28.062 --> 10:29.150
- Ooh, that's my kinda vibe.
- Yes.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.981
Welcome to Eva. Just two of you?

10:33.981 --> 10:35.504
We have a third person
joining us as well.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.811
Three. Okay. Grab a seat.
I'll be with you.

10:37.811 --> 10:40.074
Thank you. Ugh.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.945
- Ooh.
- That's so hard to push you.

10:41.945 --> 10:45.296
What is wrong with you? I don't
need to be that pushed in.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.124
Okay.

10:47.124 --> 10:48.778
So what do we like here?

10:48.778 --> 10:50.475
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

10:50.475 --> 10:53.870
- How are you?
- Good.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.524
- How are you?
- I'm good. I'm good.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.265
Brooksy.

10:57.265 --> 11:04.011
Brooks is a senior at NYU,
and he is juggling his business,

11:04.011 --> 11:06.187
working on his new collections

11:06.187 --> 11:08.319
along with his studies
at school.

11:08.319 --> 11:11.409
Can we start
with a mushroom pizza?

11:11.409 --> 11:13.368
- You sure can.
- And he was kind enough

11:13.368 --> 11:16.545
to come and visit
his old mother and father.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.073
Why don't you just stay here
for the next month?

11:23.073 --> 11:26.163
I'm in school.

11:26.163 --> 11:30.080
Oh, you--you have a significant
other in any capacity?

11:30.080 --> 11:32.517
I've actually had a boyfriend
for the past two years.

11:32.517 --> 11:36.217
Has Mom met... him?

11:36.217 --> 11:38.175
- I'm kidding.
- Oh.

11:38.175 --> 11:40.177
Like, jeez, 'cause I haven't
heard about him.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.092
What the hell? Okay.

11:42.092 --> 11:44.529
Describe your perfect boyfriend.

11:44.529 --> 11:47.881
Why don't you describe
your perfect boyfriend?

11:47.881 --> 11:50.100
My perfect boyfriend
is Brett Favre.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.234
Who's that?

11:53.234 --> 11:55.236
He's the toughest mother----er
that ever lived,

11:55.236 --> 11:58.108
and he's sexy as [bleep].

11:59.893 --> 12:01.372
- That's my perfect boyfriend.
- Wow.

12:01.372 --> 12:05.028
I don't know what my husband
sees in Brett Favre.

12:05.028 --> 12:07.378
Maybe it's the looks.

12:07.378 --> 12:10.512
Maybe it's
the depth of personality.

12:10.512 --> 12:13.080
I can't even really envision
the face, to be totally honest.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.473
I know. That's pathetic.

12:15.473 --> 12:17.562
I'm so glad you guys
are so interested

12:17.562 --> 12:19.216
in my relationship life.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.262
I'm out in the world.
If I find that perfect person,

12:21.262 --> 12:23.046
I want to introduce him to you.

12:23.046 --> 12:25.440
Set me up with whoever you want.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.922
Actually, I take that back.

12:28.922 --> 12:31.054
Well, I've got great ideas already.

12:31.054 --> 12:33.274
Auntie's always trying
to set me up.

12:33.274 --> 12:35.189
Speaking of Auntie,
we have this event with her...

12:35.189 --> 12:36.886
- Mm.
- ...coming up

12:36.886 --> 12:40.629
to raise awareness and money
for mental health and addiction,

12:40.629 --> 12:43.545
and I'll have my stuff
in the show, too,

12:43.545 --> 12:46.896
and if you have samples ready,
we'll put you in the show.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.507
We're a very close family,

12:49.507 --> 12:52.423
and last winter,
my nephew had some

12:52.423 --> 12:55.296
very, very serious
mental health issues,

12:55.296 --> 12:58.908
and my sister started
this foundation

12:58.908 --> 13:01.171
to give back to some of
these mental health facilities

13:01.171 --> 13:04.174
that she felt were
very beneficial.

13:04.174 --> 13:06.394
So I kind of came up
with this concept

13:06.394 --> 13:10.877
of doing the fashion show
as a charity fundraiser for her,

13:10.877 --> 13:12.182
and I'm very excited.

13:12.182 --> 13:14.271
I like the mini mullet.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.491
What do you think, Brooks?

13:16.491 --> 13:18.406
Whatever makes you happy.

13:18.406 --> 13:22.323
I officially gave birth
to a baby mullet.

13:22.323 --> 13:23.890
It's my mini mullet?

13:23.890 --> 13:25.413
I love when you play
with my mullet.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.023
Your mini mullet?

13:27.023 --> 13:28.938
I have a business meeting.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.635
Brooks is like, "Let's go."

13:30.635 --> 13:32.507
- Gotta go.
- All right.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.564
Okay.

13:50.481 --> 13:53.006
Some carbs, 'cause we ain't
on the keto diet in this house.

13:53.006 --> 13:56.574
We have to do our couples
interview exercise, so let's go

13:56.574 --> 13:58.185
back in the living room,
and then I'm gonna--

13:58.185 --> 13:59.708
You want me to bring you
a little plate?

13:59.708 --> 14:00.970
- No, ma'am.
- You want a water?

14:00.970 --> 14:02.450
- Want one?
- Uh, yes.

14:02.450 --> 14:05.409
The three days
that I was in New York

14:05.409 --> 14:07.368
meeting with my attorneys
was so grueling.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.109
Get this work done.

14:09.109 --> 14:11.024
We're going through mock trials.

14:11.024 --> 14:13.504
So how my legal team
is preparing me

14:13.504 --> 14:16.725
is by saying lies, spewing B.S.,

14:16.725 --> 14:19.075
and just trying
to tear you down.

14:19.075 --> 14:21.599
That's what this was
the last three days.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.950
So it feels really good
to be home.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.126
This is called soul gazing.

14:26.126 --> 14:27.344
- Obviously--
- What is the purpose of this?

14:27.344 --> 14:30.565
Well, baby,
according to the therapist,

14:30.565 --> 14:34.221
soul gazing is to allow us
to connect without talking

14:34.221 --> 14:36.701
so that I can see into your soul
through your eyes

14:36.701 --> 14:39.008
and extract something...

14:39.008 --> 14:40.662
...that I don't even understand
that I'm extracting,

14:40.662 --> 14:43.534
but it's not for me
to interpret.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.406
It's just for me to do.

14:45.406 --> 14:47.234
Coach and I originally
started therapy

14:47.234 --> 14:48.757
after my dad passed away,

14:48.757 --> 14:51.238
and I feel like now
more than ever,

14:51.238 --> 14:53.022
we have to continue
through the couples therapy

14:53.022 --> 14:57.244
to help us navigate through
these unchartered waters

14:57.244 --> 14:58.723
that neither of us
have ever been through

14:58.723 --> 15:00.073
or know how to deal with.

15:00.073 --> 15:03.119
Ready? Go.

15:03.119 --> 15:05.730
You don't have to get
that close.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.344
Okay.
I don't know about soul gazing.

15:10.344 --> 15:12.346
That clearly wasn't the one
for you.

15:12.346 --> 15:14.261
I don't understand all of

15:14.261 --> 15:16.567
the techniques, exercises,
or activities.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.048
What I do understand
is that I love you.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.007
What I do wanna improve on

15:21.007 --> 15:23.052
is my way of showing you
that I love you.

15:23.052 --> 15:26.055
- That's all that matters to me.
- Thanks, baby.

15:26.055 --> 15:31.278
You know, I wanted to just
kinda sit down and, like,

15:31.278 --> 15:34.629
debrief and decompress
from the last week and a half.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.587
I had the girls trip in Phoenix,

15:36.587 --> 15:38.285
got back on the plane
to New York.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.503
Right.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.331
Went to meetings
for two full, solid days

15:41.331 --> 15:43.072
with Priya and the legal team.

15:43.072 --> 15:46.249
Get home Monday,
find out from Priya

15:46.249 --> 15:48.643
the judge is pushing the trial
out till July.

15:48.643 --> 15:52.516
I've been working
around the clock

15:52.516 --> 15:55.606
preparing for a trial
in three weeks,

15:55.606 --> 15:59.175
stressed to the max,
trying to fit everything in.

15:59.175 --> 16:01.264
Can't sleep
'cause I'm up all night

16:01.264 --> 16:03.440
with a notepad on my nightstand,

16:03.440 --> 16:05.355
waking up if I think of
something to tell the attorneys,

16:05.355 --> 16:07.749
and I write it down, and then
all of a sudden to hear,

16:07.749 --> 16:10.012
okay, it's pushed till July.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.843
There was just, like,
a lot of emotions mixed up

16:14.843 --> 16:17.541
when I heard that.

16:17.541 --> 16:19.065
I was pissed, angry.

16:24.548 --> 16:28.248
I'm just tired of people
questioning my innocence,

16:28.248 --> 16:30.119
and I can't talk about it.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.078
I understand, baby.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.471
So I wanna go to trial. I want
my innocence to be proven,

16:34.471 --> 16:36.038
so I'm like, please.
- That's right.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.127
Let's get this over with, and we
can move on with our life.

16:38.127 --> 16:40.434
This is a test for all of us.

16:40.434 --> 16:42.175
God put this on both of us.

16:42.175 --> 16:43.524
He didn't just give this
to my wife.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.134
He put this on both of us.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.528
There's many things
that I have to learn from this,

16:47.528 --> 16:49.878
and I will never probably
understand all of them,

16:49.878 --> 16:51.793
but right now
I have to be present.

16:51.793 --> 16:54.361
I have to be stronger...

16:54.361 --> 16:56.363
because she gets scared.

16:56.363 --> 17:00.149
You can't anticipate
the unforeseen circumstances

17:00.149 --> 17:01.716
that are going to hit us.

17:01.716 --> 17:05.894
The only thing you can control
is your response.

17:05.894 --> 17:08.853
Our time is coming.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.511
<i>Coming up...</i>

17:14.511 --> 17:15.817
Hey, could we talk?

17:15.817 --> 17:17.819
More lies? Like,
I'm not really interested.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.690
Tell me what the lies are
that you think I said.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.301
Oh, there are so many, Angie.
There's too much to tell.

17:21.301 --> 17:22.911
- No, no.
- I'm not really interested.

17:22.911 --> 17:25.218
Sorry. Like, I'm--
I'm just not interested.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.319
What are you doing?

17:40.972 --> 17:42.670
Oh, my gosh. Which one?

17:44.454 --> 17:46.152
Okay, so how did she ask you?

17:50.286 --> 17:52.506
Aw.

17:52.506 --> 17:55.465
It's good. I like it.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.337
All right. I gotta go call
my brother. I love you.

17:57.337 --> 17:58.947
Okay. Love you.

17:58.947 --> 18:00.557
Send me a picture
after you drop it, okay?

18:00.557 --> 18:01.776
Okay.

18:07.651 --> 18:09.740
- Hey, B. <i>
- Hello. Hey.</i>

18:09.740 --> 18:11.960
- Hey, where are you? <i>
- I'm at home.</i>

18:11.960 --> 18:13.831
Yeah, what are you up to?

18:13.831 --> 18:16.921
<i>Just got back
from my probation officer.</i>

18:16.921 --> 18:20.316
Oh, my gosh. Kidding. Where--
like, for real, where were you?

18:20.316 --> 18:21.709
<i>I just started working.</i>

18:21.709 --> 18:23.841
There are six kids in my family,

18:23.841 --> 18:26.235
and my brother Brian
is the only boy.

18:26.235 --> 18:30.500
Growing up, Brian was constantly
playing pranks on me

18:30.500 --> 18:31.806
and messing with me.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.547
Freshman year of high school,

18:33.547 --> 18:35.853
my brother and his friends
thought it would be funny

18:35.853 --> 18:38.552
to duct-tape me to the post
in the middle

18:38.552 --> 18:40.467
of our school foyer,
and literally,

18:40.467 --> 18:42.295
like, no one would help me.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.384
Have you talked to Genia lately?

18:44.384 --> 18:45.646
<i>I haven't. How's she doing?</i>

18:45.646 --> 18:48.431
She has awful days
where she calls me,

18:48.431 --> 18:50.346
and she's, like, breaking down,

18:50.346 --> 18:52.870
and, like, yesterday,
I talked to her.

18:52.870 --> 18:56.352
Part of me was really sad
because she's like...

18:56.352 --> 18:57.658
Like, honestly, it made me cry.

18:57.658 --> 18:59.399
She was like,
"What's wrong with all of us?"

18:59.399 --> 19:03.011
Like, meaning her,
Liz, Denise, and Mary.

19:03.011 --> 19:08.712
Because she's like, "Why are we
all, like, divorced?" You know?

19:08.712 --> 19:10.888
And I just felt so bad for her.

19:10.888 --> 19:14.979
My brother and I were
the last two standing married.

19:14.979 --> 19:18.548
I have three younger sisters,
and two of them are divorced.

19:18.548 --> 19:21.377
And my youngest sister
and my oldest sister, Genia,

19:21.377 --> 19:23.684
are in the process.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.294
You know, it's, like,
hard to watch them

19:25.294 --> 19:28.384
all go through it because, like,
you wanna fix everything.

19:28.384 --> 19:30.908
<i>I do feel bad for them
with what they're going through.</i>

19:30.908 --> 19:32.954
I just, like, really hope
you guys come out

19:32.954 --> 19:35.348
'cause I could really use
my family.

19:35.348 --> 19:36.871
I'm gonna keep bugging you.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.438
<i>I hope you will.</i>

19:38.438 --> 19:41.049
- Oh, look who's here. [laughs] <i>
- Hey.</i>

19:41.049 --> 19:42.746
My forehead--
My forehead's blinding you.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.574
Um, we--

19:44.574 --> 19:45.880
Oh.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.751
You must be looking
in the mirror, dude.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.579
Well, it's good to see you, B.
I love you.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.668
<i>- All right, take care.</i>
- All right, bye, B.

19:51.668 --> 19:54.105
- Hey, um...
- So what's going on?

19:54.105 --> 19:56.107
Oh, I was just checking in
with my brother

19:56.107 --> 19:57.892
to see if he's talked
to my sisters.

19:57.892 --> 19:59.763
What's in your head?

19:59.763 --> 20:01.112
I think for me it's just,
like, overwhelming

20:01.112 --> 20:02.723
because it's like
I worry about my family.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.768
That's like my blood.
That's my people.

20:04.768 --> 20:08.946
That coupled with, like,
this consummate negativity

20:08.946 --> 20:10.121
coming from, like,
a friend group,

20:10.121 --> 20:11.558
that stresses me out, you know?

20:11.558 --> 20:13.124
Okay.

20:13.124 --> 20:15.126
And I need to counterbalance it
with something else.

20:15.126 --> 20:17.738
- What can I do?
- Maybe we need to, like,

20:17.738 --> 20:20.610
start, like, focusing on what
can you and I do more together?

20:20.610 --> 20:21.872
Okay.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.483
Like, things like just,
it feels off,

20:23.483 --> 20:26.137
and I just want to, like,
back on track.

20:26.137 --> 20:29.750
It doesn't matter how solid
John and I are right now.

20:29.750 --> 20:32.056
Rumors about my marriage
hurts and hits hard.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.797
As harsh as it sounds,

20:33.797 --> 20:36.147
you can't get buried
in other people's burdens.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.672
I know.

20:38.672 --> 20:41.152
We work together.
We're raising kids together.

20:41.152 --> 20:44.982
We've had enough things
try and hit us.

20:44.982 --> 20:46.288
I don't need somebody trying

20:46.288 --> 20:49.726
to break the only thing
that matters to me.

20:49.726 --> 20:52.642
All my sisters always say,
"You got the best husband."

20:52.642 --> 20:54.035
It's 'cause they don't know me
very well.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.819
No.

21:02.826 --> 21:05.002
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

21:05.002 --> 21:09.659
I...am putting together
my new ski rack for the Tesla.

21:09.659 --> 21:12.183
It just goes
on the trailer hitch.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.882
Oh, no, we're gonna be
trailer hitch people?

21:14.882 --> 21:16.579
I always judge those people

21:16.579 --> 21:18.059
that carry their skis
on their trailer hitch.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.452
We are top-of-the-car people.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.584
I have no idea what you're
talking about right now,

21:21.584 --> 21:24.108
but this is gonna be
really cool.

21:24.108 --> 21:25.588
I'm open for change.

21:25.588 --> 21:28.896
Um... so Larane's coming over

21:28.896 --> 21:31.942
to notarize
my resignation letter

21:31.942 --> 21:34.205
from the LDS Church.

21:34.205 --> 21:36.425
- Today's the day?
- Today's the day.

21:36.425 --> 21:38.558
All right. I'm actually
really happy for you,

21:38.558 --> 21:40.516
'cause I know you've been
wanting to do this

21:40.516 --> 21:42.083
for quite some time.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.172
This is the final piece
of, like,

21:44.172 --> 21:46.870
goodbye to the----ing man.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.046
- Not you.
- Okay. Just checking.

21:50.961 --> 21:54.225
It's funny, 'cause I was
so eager to sign the letter

21:54.225 --> 21:55.705
that I failed to read
the fine print

21:55.705 --> 21:57.707
that it had to be notarized.

21:57.707 --> 22:00.667
I didn't know I had
to get a notary.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.712
Wait. They even have a QR code

22:02.712 --> 22:05.672
for notary instructions.

22:05.672 --> 22:08.892
They make it so hard to leave
because if they can keep you,

22:08.892 --> 22:12.461
there's a chance
that they can reactivate you,

22:12.461 --> 22:14.855
which means you'll start paying
10% of your income again.

22:16.639 --> 22:19.468
I think it's all about money
and power and control.

22:19.468 --> 22:21.078
- Hi!
- Hi!

22:21.078 --> 22:22.732
Oh, my gosh. You look fabulous.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.517
You look amazing.

22:24.517 --> 22:26.519
They're not trying to save
the souls of Zion.

22:26.519 --> 22:27.563
Do you have a pen?
I should've brought a pen.

22:28.477 --> 22:28.782
Babe, will you grab a pen
from my desk?

22:29.826 --> 22:29.870
I don't need anything special.
Just need a pen.

22:30.784 --> 22:31.132
There's a black one in there.

22:31.698 --> 22:33.787
They want your 10%.

22:33.787 --> 22:35.658
I love that they do this.
Did you go through the, um...

22:35.658 --> 22:37.486
I went through quitmormon.com.

22:37.486 --> 22:39.575
- QuitMormon, yeah.
- Yeah.

22:39.575 --> 22:40.837
Yeah.

22:40.837 --> 22:42.578
You said this was, like,
the third time?

22:42.578 --> 22:44.101
- Like, this is the third time?
- Mm-hmm.

22:44.101 --> 22:45.233
So why is this the third time, like?

22:45.233 --> 22:48.497
Well, the first time...

22:48.497 --> 22:51.108
was when I was still married
to my ex.

22:51.108 --> 22:53.763
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...

22:53.763 --> 22:55.112
and I went through
the repentance process.

22:55.112 --> 22:57.637
- So I informed them...
- Yeah.

22:57.637 --> 23:00.553
...I haven't been faithful
to my husband,

23:00.553 --> 23:07.821
and I...want to get divorced,
and I want to leave the Church.

23:07.821 --> 23:12.129
They were like, "Okay, no,
you need to have a council"

23:12.129 --> 23:14.784
and tell them everything
I had done.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.525
- Right.
- How I have sinned.

23:16.525 --> 23:17.744
Like, how I have been
cheating on my husband.

23:18.875 --> 23:19.659
They'd ask me questions
about when, where, how?

23:20.616 --> 23:21.617
Which hindsight--
highly inappropriate.

23:21.617 --> 23:24.011
Right.

23:24.011 --> 23:27.754
Um... and then they had
my ex come in,

23:27.754 --> 23:32.149
and they said to me, "You'll be
forgiven of all of your sins

23:32.149 --> 23:34.543
if you go back to the temple
tomorrow."

23:34.543 --> 23:37.285
- For reals?
- For reals.

23:37.285 --> 23:43.596
It's, like, we--
based on every Mormon doctrine,

23:43.596 --> 23:46.337
everything that I've been taught
my entire life,

23:46.337 --> 23:47.991
you should be
ex-communicating me

23:47.991 --> 23:49.863
on the spot right now.

23:49.863 --> 23:52.822
I remember sitting in front
of that council

23:52.822 --> 23:58.349
feeling not only ashamed
of, like, what I've done,

23:58.349 --> 24:01.831
but I almost feel like
I'm being preyed on.

24:01.831 --> 24:03.746
I felt manipulated.
I felt icky.

24:03.746 --> 24:06.923
That's when I knew
I did not believe this.

24:06.923 --> 24:11.580
So then I got divorced.
Then I tried to do it again.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.669
But I couldn't
because I was still sealed...

24:13.669 --> 24:15.018
- Right.
- ...to my ex.

24:15.018 --> 24:16.846
I was not ex-communicated

24:16.846 --> 24:20.197
because that wouldn't be
in favor for my ex-husband.

24:20.197 --> 24:23.592
So even though I committed
the same sin as Justin,

24:23.592 --> 24:25.115
he's ex-communicated,

24:25.115 --> 24:28.989
but the men get to decide
what happens to me.

24:28.989 --> 24:31.600
Our entire life we were told
because we're women,

24:31.600 --> 24:33.384
we don't have a say.

24:33.384 --> 24:36.083
If we wanna do something,
a man has to approve it.

24:36.083 --> 24:39.303
Right. And finally,
for the first time,

24:39.303 --> 24:43.351
I get to say, and I'm saying no.

24:43.351 --> 24:45.745
As I'm going through
this healing journey,

24:45.745 --> 24:47.050
I'm starting to see
the parallels

24:47.050 --> 24:50.880
between the abuse of power
from the Church

24:50.880 --> 24:53.404
and the abuse
from my family member.

24:53.404 --> 24:56.320
And while they are
two different things,

24:56.320 --> 24:59.410
signing this letter today
is me taking back my power.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.412
I just need you
to sign and date it.

25:01.412 --> 25:02.892
Do you want me
to take a picture?

25:02.892 --> 25:04.720
- Yeah. Will you film it?
- This is a big deal.

25:04.720 --> 25:08.419
I know.
It's making it official.

25:08.419 --> 25:11.422
I'm even gonna heart the "I."

25:11.422 --> 25:13.250
All right.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.731
I feel like we should be
popping a bottle.

25:15.731 --> 25:18.734
I know. Toasting.

25:18.734 --> 25:20.257
"This letter is to inform you

25:20.257 --> 25:21.998
that I have terminated
my membership

25:21.998 --> 25:23.826
with the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints." Yes!

25:25.436 --> 25:27.090
<i>Coming up...</i>

25:27.090 --> 25:30.659
I have not spoken to Heather.

25:30.659 --> 25:32.008
Heather really hurt me.

25:47.589 --> 25:50.418
I know. It's gonna be
a bluebird day, so sunny.

25:50.418 --> 25:51.724
Hey, welcome, Heather.
Good morning.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.987
- Hi! Hi, Michael.
- Hey, how you doing?

25:53.987 --> 25:55.336
- Yeah, welcome to Snowbasin.
- Thank you.

25:55.336 --> 25:56.816
Do we look like beginners
or advanced?

25:56.816 --> 25:58.426
Ooh.
I think you look advanced.

25:58.426 --> 25:59.906
- Thank you.
- With those skis and that setup.

25:59.906 --> 26:02.735
Sorry. I have my hands full.

26:04.171 --> 26:08.392
Hi! I thought I heard
a familiar voice.

26:08.392 --> 26:10.481
- Good to see you.
- Look, it's my twin.

26:10.481 --> 26:12.396
- Hi!
- Hi. Hi, Dre.

26:12.396 --> 26:14.529
This is my cousin Morgan.
I think you guys have met.

26:14.529 --> 26:16.009
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. Good. How are you?

26:16.009 --> 26:17.401
- Thanks for coming.
- I'm so excited.

26:17.401 --> 26:21.014
This is my cousin Ali,
but she married in.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.276
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:22.276 --> 26:23.451
Even though we still look
a lot alike.

26:23.451 --> 26:24.844
- And then here's...
- Hi!

26:24.844 --> 26:28.021
...the real twin twin.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.762
This is my cousin Susan
who's named after my mom.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.981
- Okay.
- Heather!

26:31.981 --> 26:32.982
- What's up, girl?!
- What's up?!

26:32.982 --> 26:35.376
- Hi!
- Hi! Oh, my gosh. Hi.

26:35.376 --> 26:37.813
- Let me take your board for you.
- Yes.

26:37.813 --> 26:39.859
Thank you so much
for inviting me!

26:39.859 --> 26:41.121
You're welcome.
Come meet my cousins.

26:41.121 --> 26:44.037
- Okay, yeah, absolutely.
- Ali, Susie,

26:44.037 --> 26:45.560
this is my friend Danna.
You know Dre from Beauty Lab.

26:45.560 --> 26:46.996
- Oh, hey! How are you?
- You know Danna.

26:46.996 --> 26:50.217
You can tell she's a
Beauty Labber. Look at her skin.

26:50.217 --> 26:51.871
I love Danna, and she's been
coming to Beauty Lab

26:51.871 --> 26:54.395
since we were at
our old location years ago.

26:54.395 --> 26:57.920
So it's fun to be able to hang
out with her outside of work.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.880
What do you listen to, rap?

27:00.880 --> 27:02.577
I listen to... yeah.
I listen to...

27:02.577 --> 27:04.405
- I listen to rap.
- I listen to everything.

27:04.405 --> 27:06.059
You know how
there's Jenny from the block?

27:06.059 --> 27:08.409
I'm Danna from the park.

27:08.409 --> 27:10.367
Women like Danna inspire me

27:10.367 --> 27:11.891
because she has
a very good heart,

27:11.891 --> 27:14.458
but she also still keeps
her edge.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.852
It's beautiful today.

27:16.852 --> 27:18.941
- Hi.
- Well, hello.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.900
You look so good.
I like you in orange.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.292
Look at you, beauty.

27:24.338 --> 27:27.080
You know I'm gonna be on
the bunny hill the whole day.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.124
You can come visit me.

27:28.124 --> 27:29.386
No, come
with the advanced group.

27:29.386 --> 27:30.561
Trust me,
you don't want me on that.

27:30.561 --> 27:33.956
I'll be, like, screaming
all the way down.

27:33.956 --> 27:35.218
Who do you think's gonna be
on the bunny hill? You?

27:35.218 --> 27:37.960
- Jen.
- So that leaves...

27:37.960 --> 27:39.222
Me, Heather, and Meredith?

27:39.222 --> 27:40.223
Yeah.

27:42.443 --> 27:47.970
I have not spoken to Heather
since Arizona.

27:47.970 --> 27:50.320
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.323
Heather really hurt me.

27:53.323 --> 27:56.413
And I've been
so open and vulnerable

27:56.413 --> 27:58.111
about something that's painful
for me right now,

27:58.111 --> 28:03.203
and I feel like that
was being used

28:03.203 --> 28:04.857
as a weapon against me.
- Against you.

28:04.857 --> 28:06.119
This is the song and dance
that Heather and I do.

28:06.119 --> 28:08.338
Like, we just gotta break
the ice.

28:08.338 --> 28:10.514
I don't know if it is
the best day

28:10.514 --> 28:12.386
to try to resolve things
with Heather,

28:12.386 --> 28:13.953
but if she is open
to talking about it,

28:13.953 --> 28:16.303
then I'll talk with her.

28:16.303 --> 28:18.348
Like, I think, you know,
you learned about

28:18.348 --> 28:20.220
a lot about your relationship
with Heather that day.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.222
And, like, and that gives you

28:22.222 --> 28:24.093
an opportunity for change
and growth.

28:24.093 --> 28:25.965
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- And you.

28:25.965 --> 28:28.184
Like, I never thought we'd be
sitting here in a car together.

28:28.184 --> 28:29.490
- Hi, Whitney.
- Yeah.

28:29.490 --> 28:30.883
I'll come down
to the bunny hill later.

28:30.883 --> 28:34.495
- I need a drink.
- Come visit me.

28:34.495 --> 28:36.323
Oh, hello!

28:36.323 --> 28:40.109
Boop, boop, boop, boop!

28:41.676 --> 28:43.896
- I'm here!
- Hi!

28:43.896 --> 28:45.985
This is Danna from Beauty Lab
I was telling you about.

28:45.985 --> 28:47.551
- Nice meeting you.
- Hi!

28:47.551 --> 28:49.423
- Nice meeting you.
- No, so are you.

28:49.423 --> 28:50.511
- This is my cousin Ali.
- Hi.

28:50.511 --> 28:51.642
- Hi!
- This is Jen.

28:51.642 --> 28:53.166
Nice to meet you.

28:53.166 --> 28:55.124
Oh, so you're gonna
teach me how to ski?

28:55.124 --> 28:56.691
- Sure.
- No, she's not.

28:56.691 --> 28:58.214
There are rumors circulating

28:58.214 --> 29:00.477
about you
that you will be bartending

29:00.477 --> 29:02.175
on the bunny hill today.
- Absolutely.

29:03.437 --> 29:06.527
Am I athletic? Yes.
Am I a skier? No.

29:06.527 --> 29:11.271
Me and the bunny hill today--
we're gonna be best friends,

29:11.271 --> 29:14.535
delivering Easter eggs
to these bitches.

29:14.535 --> 29:17.364
- Hi! How are you?
- How are you?

29:17.364 --> 29:19.018
- So good to see you.
- You look beautiful.

29:19.018 --> 29:20.367
Thank you.

29:20.367 --> 29:22.151
Hi.

29:22.151 --> 29:23.631
Oh, Ange!

29:23.631 --> 29:24.980
- How are you?
- Hi.

29:24.980 --> 29:28.027
Let me help you.
I love the swans.

29:28.027 --> 29:30.377
- It my swan song.
- It is your swan song. Hi.

29:30.377 --> 29:32.335
- Don't mind me if I do ballet.
- Thanks for coming.

29:34.642 --> 29:37.166
- No!
- No?

29:37.166 --> 29:39.255
What is Angie Harrington
doing here?

29:44.608 --> 29:47.655
Are these real questions?

29:47.655 --> 29:50.223
You guys, you guys, you guys,
everybody, thank you so much

29:50.223 --> 29:52.094
for coming
to our snow bunny ski day.

29:52.094 --> 29:54.140
You're welcome!

29:54.140 --> 29:56.620
Now I want you to self-assess.

29:56.620 --> 29:59.275
If you feel comfortable
heading up the gondola

29:59.275 --> 30:02.757
to the top of the mountain
and skiing the hardest hills,

30:02.757 --> 30:06.413
then you'll wanna follow me
and my bad-ass cousins.

30:06.413 --> 30:07.762
Okay.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.285
If you'd rather take it easy,
that's okay, too.

30:09.285 --> 30:11.418
We're taking the champagne
with us,

30:11.418 --> 30:13.463
but don't worry about that.

30:13.463 --> 30:14.595
- Hi, Katy. I'm Angie.
- Angie, nice to meet you.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.771
- Hey.
- What's up?

30:16.771 --> 30:19.034
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

30:19.034 --> 30:22.646
This hug is as fake as
everything else about her.

30:22.646 --> 30:25.432
Why are you----ing hugging me?

30:25.432 --> 30:28.217
You----ing lied about me
to damage me and my family.

30:28.217 --> 30:31.786
You could have hurt my business.
Why are you here?

30:31.786 --> 30:33.483
Your name is
on your skis and gear.

30:33.483 --> 30:35.616
Put it on,
and let's go to the gondola.

30:35.616 --> 30:37.487
I mean, it's like,
okay, Heather,

30:37.487 --> 30:40.142
we're working on being
in a good place.

30:40.142 --> 30:41.796
How do you expect us
to have a good relationship

30:41.796 --> 30:43.711
if you invite somebody

30:43.711 --> 30:46.192
that just talked badly
about my family and my marriage?

30:49.195 --> 30:51.023
<i>Coming up...</i>

30:51.023 --> 30:55.592
Danna and Jen--they're like,
"Why did you invite Angie H.?"

30:55.592 --> 30:57.377
And when I, like,
just put together a list

30:57.377 --> 31:00.641
of who I wanted to ski with,
I didn't even think about you.

31:20.095 --> 31:21.227
Thank you.

31:21.227 --> 31:23.185
It's so pretty.

31:23.185 --> 31:25.361
- Oh, this is gorgeous.
- It's gorgeous.

31:25.361 --> 31:27.668
The sound of success.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.585
Just like in western movies.

31:33.587 --> 31:35.241
Let's hit it.

31:53.215 --> 31:55.783
Opening Ceremonies, bitches!

31:55.783 --> 31:58.351
I am from Hawaii.

31:58.351 --> 32:00.744
I'm like Moana, okay? I am like
the Heart of the Ocean.

32:02.442 --> 32:03.704
How do I turn?

32:03.704 --> 32:06.228
- Big bitch energy.
- Come on, let's go.

32:06.228 --> 32:08.448
Wait. I'm not on the ocean
right now. I'm on the snow.

32:08.448 --> 32:11.581
And I have made great progress,
because a few years ago,

32:11.581 --> 32:13.583
I was on roller skates
trying to prepare.

32:15.237 --> 32:17.587
Move it! Move it!

32:17.587 --> 32:19.415
Move on down that hill!

32:19.415 --> 32:21.678
Move it! Move it!

32:21.678 --> 32:23.158
Uh-oh.

32:23.158 --> 32:25.247
- Move it on down that hill!
- Oh, sh--.

32:25.247 --> 32:29.251
But now I'm on the snow.
I'm on the sticks.

32:29.251 --> 32:31.645
Pizza, French fry?
What do you want?

32:31.645 --> 32:35.954
You know, I'm not really, like,
an outdoor mountain girl.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.651
Like, my version of outdoors
is, like,

32:37.651 --> 32:42.351
sitting on a beach with a cabana
with service.

32:42.351 --> 32:43.831
Whoops. Aah!

32:43.831 --> 32:46.747
Food service. Beverage service.

32:46.747 --> 32:48.531
Maybe someone that would, like,

32:48.531 --> 32:51.970
come and bring me new towels
every hour.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.758
Like, this kind of
isn't my thing.

32:57.758 --> 33:00.326
- You guys, I'm so hot.
- Oh, my gosh. That was amazing.

33:00.326 --> 33:03.677
We can be in bikinis.
Bikini skiing.

33:03.677 --> 33:04.983
I know. We should be in bikinis!

33:04.983 --> 33:07.463
I feel like snowboarding
looks way harder.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.161
I would say
it's a little harder.

33:13.208 --> 33:15.471
Do your girls board, too, or no?

33:15.471 --> 33:16.733
Well, my 20-year-old--
she boards.

33:16.733 --> 33:19.432
We have a 10-year-old,
a 7, and a 4. Oh, 5.

33:19.432 --> 33:20.999
And you gave birth
to the 10, 7, and 4?

33:20.999 --> 33:22.609
- Yeah.
- Well, I gave birth to this one

33:22.609 --> 33:25.307
right there, Angie K.
- Yeah. Yes, I'm her baby.

33:25.307 --> 33:28.876
Listen, when I rolled up,
I saw Angie H., not Angie K.

33:32.314 --> 33:34.664
Well, she wasn't
on my guest list.

33:34.664 --> 33:36.449
I mean, we were friends
for 20 years,

33:36.449 --> 33:39.365
and she lied about me
and my family and my business.

33:39.365 --> 33:41.280
That's not a friend.
I don't even want her around me.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.238
But 20 years is so long, though.

33:43.238 --> 33:44.805
Like, how do you feel about
ending that friendship with her?

33:44.805 --> 33:46.850
Fine. She's Heather
and Whitney's friend.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.983
I'm uninterested.

33:48.983 --> 33:50.637
It makes me question Heather
a little bit, though,

33:50.637 --> 33:52.508
because it's like,
Heather, you, like, know

33:52.508 --> 33:54.858
she's been talking sh--
about me.

33:54.858 --> 33:57.296
Like, why are you inviting her?
Especially because, like,

33:57.296 --> 33:59.602
Heather and I have been working
towards a better friendship.

33:59.602 --> 34:00.516
Right.

34:02.257 --> 34:03.911
You know what?

34:03.911 --> 34:06.348
I think we wrap this up,
and we go to après-ski.

34:06.348 --> 34:07.741
Yes!

34:07.741 --> 34:09.612
We're gonna get
tore up to the floor up.

34:09.612 --> 34:11.310
We're gonna turn up, okay?

34:11.310 --> 34:12.354
- Yes!
- Let's do it.

34:17.403 --> 34:19.883
- Come in, everybody.
- Heather, this is gorgeous.

34:19.883 --> 34:22.277
Thank you for coming
and joining me.

34:22.277 --> 34:24.018
Get settled. Get comfy.
Take your helmets off.

34:24.018 --> 34:27.326
- This is so gorgeous. I love it.
- Isn't this beautiful?

34:27.326 --> 34:29.284
- Look at the view. It's amazing.
- This is spectacular.

34:29.284 --> 34:35.247
Oh, my goodness! You survived!
You're here. How was it?

34:38.815 --> 34:40.774
Wow.

34:45.909 --> 34:48.390
Should we get a drink, girls?

34:48.390 --> 34:50.044
Got a couple of different
whites, couple different reds.

34:50.044 --> 34:53.091
- Um, we've got some champagne.
- I think I'll have a Chardonnay.

34:57.704 --> 34:58.748
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

34:58.748 --> 35:00.750
- Cheers. <i>
- Salut!</i>

35:00.750 --> 35:02.839
Last time we saw you,
it was a group hug

35:02.839 --> 35:04.928
and a lot of tears,
worried about our girl,

35:04.928 --> 35:07.061
but now it's completely flipped.

35:07.061 --> 35:09.803
I have been wanting the trial
to happen since last October.

35:09.803 --> 35:11.109
Yeah.

35:11.109 --> 35:15.939
And so my perspective is
whenever it happens,

35:15.939 --> 35:17.767
that's when
God wants it to happen.

35:17.767 --> 35:20.509
Yep, and it's gonna be--
and it's gonna work out amazing.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.381
Did they give you a date?

35:22.381 --> 35:25.645
So here's the thing.
We're looking at July 11th.

35:26.950 --> 35:29.910
Oh, so Hamptons.

35:29.910 --> 35:31.607
- Hamptons!
- I know, like, literally,

35:31.607 --> 35:32.652
I'm like, Jen,
I'll get the house.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.132
- Get the house.
- Weekend.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.134
I don't know why
we're celebrating this.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.570
In Hamptons.

35:37.570 --> 35:39.398
'Cause there's more time
that goes by

35:39.398 --> 35:41.617
that she doesn't know
what the outcome's gonna be.

35:41.617 --> 35:43.358
She doesn't know who
the witnesses are.

35:43.358 --> 35:44.925
She doesn't know the evidence. Like...

35:44.925 --> 35:50.452
The prosecution could be
gathering key witnesses.

35:50.452 --> 35:53.412
This could be really bad
for Jen.

35:53.412 --> 35:54.804
Okay, I'm gonna make a plate.

35:56.937 --> 36:00.070
- That was lovely.
- Such a nice day.

36:00.070 --> 36:01.724
I had such a nice time.

36:03.639 --> 36:05.380
- Hi, my dear.
- Oh, hi, honey.

36:05.380 --> 36:06.816
- How are you?
- Am I interrupting?

36:06.816 --> 36:08.818
- Oh, no.
- No. You're welcome.

36:08.818 --> 36:10.777
So I was with Heather
last night,

36:10.777 --> 36:12.996
and we had a little spritzer.

36:12.996 --> 36:15.695
Um, but she was saying that,
like, in Arizona,

36:15.695 --> 36:18.001
you guys had a falling out,
which was very surprising to me,

36:18.001 --> 36:19.829
'cause you guys are...
- Yeah.

36:19.829 --> 36:22.049
...have always been
ride or die for each other.

36:22.049 --> 36:24.660
The problem is, is that
we got tripped up

36:24.660 --> 36:27.010
on details
instead of bigger picture.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.838
We were all at a Jazz game.

36:28.838 --> 36:30.492
We all talked
about a certain man,

36:30.492 --> 36:31.841
and I know you know
who I'm talking about.

36:31.841 --> 36:33.191
Okay.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.018
We were joking that Heather
should date him.

36:35.018 --> 36:36.977
The rumor was that Lisa had,

36:36.977 --> 36:41.111
which Lisa clearly says
she hasn't.

36:44.550 --> 36:46.987
- We were totally drinking.
- Yeah.

36:46.987 --> 36:49.685
I'll be honest with you. I don't
remember all these details.

36:49.685 --> 36:52.122
- I know that we did.
- Right, and I think it's

36:52.122 --> 36:55.125
pretty clear I would own it if
I remembered it. I just don't.

36:55.125 --> 36:56.953
I expect this of Angie.

36:56.953 --> 37:00.130
This is what liars do
to cover their asses.

37:00.130 --> 37:03.133
But I'm not as upset with her because

37:03.133 --> 37:05.005
the stakes aren't as high
with me and Angie.

37:05.005 --> 37:07.877
Like, Heather means more to me.

37:07.877 --> 37:09.575
The fact that you wear Spanx--

37:09.575 --> 37:11.054
if I could wear Spanx
with this outfit, I would.

37:11.054 --> 37:12.534
- Yes, you can!
- Well, tell me next time.

37:12.534 --> 37:14.449
Bitch, shut the [bleep] up.

37:14.449 --> 37:18.758
What happened on
the bunny slope? How was it?

37:18.758 --> 37:22.762
You invited Angie Harrington
to ski day? Really?

37:22.762 --> 37:26.113
I feel like Lisa
is feeling like,

37:26.113 --> 37:28.028
if we're trying to get
to a better place,

37:28.028 --> 37:30.030
why did Heather invite...

37:30.030 --> 37:32.250
- Angie.
- Angie.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.860
Yeah. No, that's totally fair.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.078
I was just trying to,
like, bring

37:35.078 --> 37:36.732
all of the worlds together.
- Yeah.

37:36.732 --> 37:38.778
If I was her, I would wanna
hear that from you.

37:38.778 --> 37:40.736
It's like a sh--ty excuse,
but it's the truth.

37:40.736 --> 37:42.260
- I didn't do it to be, like...
- Then just tell her.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.087
- ...to be a jab.
- Just talk to her.

37:44.087 --> 37:45.480
Go there right now.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.004
Okay, everybody.

37:48.004 --> 37:50.268
Can I have
a quick convo with you, Lise?

37:50.268 --> 37:52.748
- Okay.
- Come over here, Angie K.

37:52.748 --> 37:54.533
- Sit down.
- Okay.

37:54.533 --> 37:57.231
- Right here?
- Yeah.

37:57.231 --> 38:01.496
Um... so I just had a little
conversation with Danna and Jen.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.542
Okay.

38:03.542 --> 38:07.807
And they're like,
"Why did you invite Angie H.?"

38:07.807 --> 38:09.635
When I, like, just put together

38:09.635 --> 38:11.071
a list of who I wanted
to ski with,

38:11.071 --> 38:13.508
I didn't even think about you
or consider you,

38:13.508 --> 38:15.293
and I--I'm sorry for that.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.164
The fact that Heather

38:17.164 --> 38:19.775
didn't even take my feelings
into consideration

38:19.775 --> 38:23.518
might be worse
than the guest list.

38:23.518 --> 38:24.911
Just so you know, going forward,

38:24.911 --> 38:26.521
like, I wouldn't be okay
with that,

38:26.521 --> 38:27.870
and I also want you to know,

38:27.870 --> 38:30.003
like, I would never do that
to you, you know?

38:30.003 --> 38:32.614
- I got it, and I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

38:32.614 --> 38:34.181
You wanna get
some food and drinks?

38:34.181 --> 38:35.704
Yeah, yeah, let's do it right.

38:35.704 --> 38:37.924
- Do you want some charcuterie?
- No.

38:37.924 --> 38:40.579
- I do.
- You're like, "I do."

38:40.579 --> 38:44.147
Okay, wait, hold on.
I'm gonna grab a little bit.

38:44.147 --> 38:47.847
Hey, hey, could we talk?
Let's go over here.

38:47.847 --> 38:50.066
Let's talk.

38:50.066 --> 38:52.330
Angie, to be honest,
I'm not really interested.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.332
- Well...
- With, like, more lies,

38:54.332 --> 38:55.724
like, I'm not
really interested.

38:55.724 --> 38:56.551
- Tell me...
- Yeah.

38:57.291 --> 38:58.771
Tell me what the lies are, Lisa.

38:58.771 --> 39:00.338
I'm not really interested. Like...

39:00.338 --> 39:02.165
Tell me what the lies are
that you think I've said.

39:02.165 --> 39:03.732
Oh, there's so many, Angie.
It's too much to count.

39:03.732 --> 39:05.081
- No, no.
- I'm not really interested.

39:05.081 --> 39:08.955
Sorry. Like, I'm--
I'm just not interested.

39:08.955 --> 39:12.001
She's not my guest.

39:23.012 --> 39:23.230
I'm not really interested, like...

39:24.449 --> 39:25.145
Tell me what the lies are
that you think I've said.

39:26.015 --> 39:26.929
- Oh, there's so many, Angie.
- No, no.

39:28.148 --> 39:28.191
There's too much to count.
I'm not really interested.

39:29.410 --> 39:31.064
Sorry. Like, I'm--
I'm just not interested.

39:31.064 --> 39:34.197
She's not my guest.

39:34.197 --> 39:36.896
It doesn't matter that we knew
each other for 20 years.

39:36.896 --> 39:39.028
It's like, stab you in the back,
kiss you in the cheek.

39:39.028 --> 39:41.422
And sometimes it's both
at the same time.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.381
The damage has been done.

39:48.821 --> 39:51.040
- We actually have to go.
- Yeah.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.912
- We won't be long.
- Oh, go, go, go, go, go.

39:52.912 --> 39:53.782
Where are we talking?
Right here?

39:53.782 --> 39:55.436
Um, yeah, over here.

39:55.436 --> 39:56.785
Ohh.

39:56.785 --> 39:59.745
What's up, sis?

39:59.745 --> 40:04.184
I just... ooh.

40:04.184 --> 40:07.187
Our... our fight
was over details.

40:07.187 --> 40:13.149
I remember very clearly
talking with you about Lisa.

40:13.149 --> 40:15.021
I know we've talked about rumors
about Lisa.

40:15.021 --> 40:17.719
We've talked about Lisa... for...

40:17.719 --> 40:19.155
- Yeah.
- ...ever.

40:19.155 --> 40:21.114
But I had never heard
those specific rumors,

40:21.114 --> 40:25.161
and I felt like you came
charging up after this, like,

40:25.161 --> 40:27.773
looking for me to corroborate,
and, girl,

40:27.773 --> 40:30.036
if I could,
I wouldn't even flinch.

40:30.036 --> 40:31.777
I wasn't asking you
to corroborate.

40:31.777 --> 40:34.344
I was just asking you
to have my back.

40:34.344 --> 40:35.998
I don't want you to corroborate
if you don't remember.

40:35.998 --> 40:39.045
If you don't remember,
that's fine. That's fair.

40:39.045 --> 40:41.700
But I remember, so we're gonna
have to agree to disagree...

40:41.700 --> 40:43.136
- Absolutely.
- ...on that detail.

40:43.136 --> 40:44.398
Absolutely.

40:44.398 --> 40:46.269
Agree to disagree to me
just means,

40:46.269 --> 40:49.751
"I will let you go
on this crazy-ass journey,

40:49.751 --> 40:52.319
and I will be waiting for you
when you come back,"

40:52.319 --> 40:55.322
because there's no disagreement.
She's just wrong.

40:55.322 --> 40:57.237
But there's something
that you did on that trip...

40:57.237 --> 40:59.935
- What?
- ...that hurt me even more.

40:59.935 --> 41:05.506
You said, like, took, my pain
and weaponized it against me.

41:05.506 --> 41:07.290
- How did I--
- I don't even know

41:07.290 --> 41:09.031
if you are aware...
- I'm--Tell me how I did that.

41:09.031 --> 41:11.033
- ...of what you did.
- Tell me.

41:11.033 --> 41:14.080
You kinda turned it on me that
I made the trip about myself,

41:14.080 --> 41:17.126
this healing journey, that it
should have been about Jen.

41:17.126 --> 41:19.477
But, like, in the moment,
I didn't see me sharing

41:19.477 --> 41:22.305
what I was going through
as, like,

41:22.305 --> 41:24.177
me making it about me.

41:24.177 --> 41:26.135
I'm sorry if that was
interpreted that way.

41:26.135 --> 41:30.226
I just think what matters
is that I was hurt,

41:30.226 --> 41:32.359
and I want you to hear that.

41:32.359 --> 41:35.536
I don't believe she's
being sincere because

41:35.536 --> 41:37.364
she still hasn't, like,

41:37.364 --> 41:41.194
given an explicit "I'm sorry
for not having your back."

41:41.194 --> 41:42.369
It is Bad Weather
no matter what,

41:42.369 --> 41:46.155
and we can weather the storm.
- Okay.

41:46.155 --> 41:49.942
Heather's, like, the biggest,
like, "Woe is me" person,

41:49.942 --> 41:52.945
and I have been there
for Heather countless times,

41:52.945 --> 41:57.253
but in this moment,
all I hear is...

41:57.253 --> 41:59.952
Heather doesn't care about me.

41:59.952 --> 42:01.910
Thank you for hearing me
and understanding my hurt,

42:01.910 --> 42:05.218
but it was so deep that it's
just gonna take me a minute.

42:05.218 --> 42:08.438
I'm trying not to put up walls,
but, like, my natural instinct

42:08.438 --> 42:10.876
is to be like,
"Don't touch her."

42:16.490 --> 42:19.841
<i>Next time on "The Real
Housewives of Salt Lake City"...</i>

42:19.841 --> 42:21.539
Don't hit me.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.105
Yes!

42:25.064 --> 42:28.328
He said, "With Whitney
being a public figure,

42:28.328 --> 42:31.244
it was gonna be
a conflict of interest."

42:31.244 --> 42:34.552
Knowing I'm one of the reasons
he got let go

42:34.552 --> 42:36.858
pisses me the [bleep] off.

42:36.858 --> 42:38.338
Here they are.

42:38.338 --> 42:39.948
- Hello! You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

42:39.948 --> 42:41.907
Angie Harrington's husband

42:41.907 --> 42:44.300
started an Instagram page
called Shah Exposed.

42:44.300 --> 42:47.826
That's a big----ing deal.

42:47.826 --> 42:50.916
When it comes to Angie, you need
to be a little bit more aware

42:50.916 --> 42:52.352
of what's going on.

42:52.352 --> 42:54.267
Who's ready to audition?

42:57.096 --> 43:01.361
The last thing I expected was
to see Angie Harrington here.
