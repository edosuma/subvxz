WEBVTT

00:00.167 --> 00:01.710
[Mac] Previously on
Commander in Chief:

00:01.793 --> 00:05.130
- [woman] The president had a stroke.
- Do I take the oath?

00:05.214 --> 00:07.341
Madam Vice President.
We need you to resign.

00:07.424 --> 00:10.093
I'm gonna go out
and I'm gonna take the oath of office.

00:10.219 --> 00:12.095
The president of the United States!

00:12.262 --> 00:14.973
[Rod] You have a country
full of people who believe in you.

00:15.057 --> 00:18.352
Those are the nominees I can
guarantee I can get through Congress.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.312
I want you to be my chief of staff.

00:20.395 --> 00:23.357
They don't see me as a spouse.
They see me as an advisor.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.692
Do yourself a favor, Rod.
Stay in your lane.

00:25.776 --> 00:28.070
- I went to public school.
- So I have to go too.

00:28.904 --> 00:31.073
Templeton's not choosing
my vice president.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.200
- She's picked somebody.
- Warren Keaton.

00:33.867 --> 00:37.079
- What's going on, Jayne?
- Mackenzie Allen needs to show respect.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.267
If you want a man
who's worth a damn in this job,

00:39.373 --> 00:42.000
you gotta make this job worth a damn.

00:42.142 --> 00:44.962
He won't be confirmed.
Not with what I know.

00:46.129 --> 00:50.050
[man] With all due respect, this visit
is not a negotiation with the Russians.

00:50.133 --> 00:54.096
It's a pre-approved package, a photo op.
A goodwill tea party with the Russians.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.575
No items on the table
that haven't been agreed to.

00:56.682 --> 00:59.893
Implicit in a State Visit's
the idea that the pact's been signed.

00:59.977 --> 01:03.730
But by the previous administration.
I have yet to weigh in on any issues...

01:03.814 --> 01:06.483
Can't take the chance
of derailing your first summit.

01:06.567 --> 01:10.028
- It's too public a venue for missteps.
- I wasn't planning on making any.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.072
- I'm simply asking.
- Kharkov is not the guy

01:12.155 --> 01:14.866
you want to talk to about
jailed dissident journalists.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.244
Ma'am, the truth
is our nascent administration

01:17.327 --> 01:21.164
- needs the win more than his does.
- All right. Big day tomorrow.

01:21.248 --> 01:24.002
Let's all try to get some rest.
Thank you.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.753
I had the Russia desk
translate a few phrases for you.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.422
- Thank you.
- Good luck tomorrow.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.798
[Mac] Thank you.

01:31.174 --> 01:34.261
For a second, I thought I was
being handed a script to read from.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.014
Increases in natural gas production.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.960
Forward movement on the
Russian-American space station.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.227
We're accomplishing
some big things here.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.438
Yet human rights
still don't make the list.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.315
Not this time.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.193
- [man] Madam President.
- Thank you.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.114
- Hey.
- Oh, good for you.

01:54.197 --> 01:57.826
Teddy's head never even hit the pillow
the night before his first State Visit.

01:58.035 --> 01:59.119
Hmm.

01:59.202 --> 02:02.122
He spent half the night
practicing his salute in the mirror.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.958
[chuckles] President Bridges
always seemed like a rock.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.960
It's funny to think of him as nervous.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.545
Don't worry.
You're gonna be wonderful tomorrow.

02:09.630 --> 02:13.634
- [Mac] Thank you.
- Or rather, today.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.802
- Good night.
- Good night.

02:15.886 --> 02:19.598
So my chief of staff won't
even discuss bringing up the

02:19.681 --> 02:22.184
- dissident journalists with Kharkov.
- Mm-hm.

02:22.267 --> 02:26.229
He's just... You know, he shuts me down
every time. Just starts lecturing me.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.106
Oh, lectures.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.734
Lectures are bad.

02:32.611 --> 02:34.905
- Right?
- Hmm.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.954
Get to bed.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.420
You just gotta learn
to turn off your mind.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.297
- Mmm…
- Uh-huh...

02:52.381 --> 02:54.216
[both chuckle]

02:54.925 --> 02:58.220
You can't claim to have a free society
if you don't have a free press.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.305
- [Rod] No...
- Mmm...

03:03.183 --> 03:06.561
[Amy screaming] Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy!

03:06.728 --> 03:08.355
- [Amy] Mommy!
- I'm coming!

03:08.438 --> 03:10.691
- [Rod] Honey, you OK?
- Baby, it's OK.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.109
You're having a bad dream.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.861
It's OK. Oh… What happened?

03:14.945 --> 03:16.488
[crying] I couldn't find you.

03:16.571 --> 03:19.658
I was looking all over for you
and I couldn't find you.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.619
OK. Well, I'm here now.
I'm here. Mommy's here. Baby.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.704
[Amy screams]

03:24.913 --> 03:27.791
- Everything all right, ma'am?
- She had a nightmare.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.876
- Go. Go.
- [Mac] She's OK.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.503
[man] Sorry, sir.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.677
My eggs are overcooked.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.556
- I like the yolks runny. Yours OK?
- Perfect.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.392
[waiter] I'll remind the chef.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.602
Stay out of trouble last night?

03:47.686 --> 03:50.188
Yeah, it was fine. I had dinner at…

03:50.272 --> 03:51.606
Oh, completely forgot.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.067
I ran into General Keaton
last night at The Palm.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.652
You what?

03:56.236 --> 03:59.573
Did her esteemed vice-presidential
candidate have anything to say?

03:59.656 --> 04:02.492
Said he was looking forward
to the confirmation hearing.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.953
Wondered if you'd
send the questions in advance.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.122
[laughing] The wanker.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.916
- What'd you tell him?
- I said he was wearing a nice tie.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.003
He was the toast of the room last night.
He and his wife.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.089
You have to pick up
the NSA in 20 minutes.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.382
Yeah.

04:17.466 --> 04:21.344
It's going to be a challenging day
for our president.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.556
I think by the end of it
she may well wish

04:24.639 --> 04:27.809
that she were back running her school.

04:29.019 --> 04:32.314
Good morning. Got some fresh
chocolate-chip muffins for you today.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.816
Sam, what are you doing to me?

04:34.900 --> 04:37.110
You know I have a gown
to fit into tonight.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.321
Have you seen
Amy's subtraction workbook?

04:39.404 --> 04:41.948
Uh… I saw it under
the portrait of Coolidge.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.868
- You seen this?
- What?

04:44.951 --> 04:46.947
- Op-ed piece.
- The Times?

04:47.072 --> 04:47.954
Post.

04:48.038 --> 04:48.997
Hey!

04:49.247 --> 04:52.167
Hey, I'm the president.
Go get yourself another muffin.

04:52.375 --> 04:55.462
Yeah, there's something
like that in The Times too.

04:55.670 --> 04:59.549
I know. Thank you, Sam.
They're all the same.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.635
Will I be able to handle the summit,

05:01.718 --> 05:05.514
whether I'll confront Kharkov on his
country's retreat from civil liberties.

05:05.597 --> 05:07.766
Hey, Horace.
Have you seen my biology book?

05:07.849 --> 05:09.726
- I don't know.
- Look under Coolidge.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.479
Good morning.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.816
Wanna make sure we're up to speed
for the state dinner this evening.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.943
Wait, that state dinner thing's tonight?

05:18.026 --> 05:20.278
- [Nora] Yes. Very exciting, isn't it?
- [scoffs]

05:20.487 --> 05:21.446
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.156
- Bye, baby.
- See ya.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.368
- Come on, guys.
- Becca. What? No goodbye?

05:26.576 --> 05:28.119
Bye.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.914
Madam President. Mr. Calloway.

05:30.997 --> 05:34.334
- Big day. Big, big day.
- I can hardly wait.

05:34.543 --> 05:37.003
[Nora] I wanted you to know
the white delphinium tapers

05:37.254 --> 05:39.653
have finally been located
for this evening.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.628
- U.S. Postal Service.
- [Rod grunts]

05:41.842 --> 05:44.553
Well, I can't believe
I have to play tour guide all day.

05:45.637 --> 05:48.682
Have you, uh, have you seen
a picture of Mrs. Kharkova?

05:48.765 --> 05:50.851
- Yes, I have.
- I think you can handle it.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.519
She's no Mackenzie Allen.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.776
Nathan.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.738
I haven't seen you since the funeral.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.533
- You OK?
- I still can't believe it.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.786
That he's dead or that she had
the balls to take the oath of office?

06:10.537 --> 06:13.415
She defied the dying wishes
of a great man.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.418
- It's unforgivable.
- Damn right.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.128
Wolfie, I'm gonna run.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.715
I'm gonna run for president. I have to.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.133
And I'm gonna win.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.678
- If it's against her...
- [chuckling] It'll be against her.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.514
Oh, yeah. I guarantee you that.

06:29.598 --> 06:31.474
[Nathan] She'll run as an Independent.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.060
And do you know how many
states she's going to carry?

06:34.144 --> 06:36.897
Her home state, maybe, Connecticut...

06:37.105 --> 06:39.149
She's not gonna carry a state.
Nary a one.

06:39.983 --> 06:42.193
No, I'm gonna be president.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.614
And I want you with me.

06:45.697 --> 06:48.034
As my national security advisor.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.037
Temp, I don't know what to say.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.998
How about, "Bloody hell, yeah."

06:55.665 --> 06:57.292
Well, then…

06:57.876 --> 07:00.837
- Bloody hell, yeah.
- [Nate chuckles]

07:00.921 --> 07:03.882
Wolfie, I need you to resign.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.634
Today. Now.

07:08.637 --> 07:11.014
Shouldn't we wait
till at least after the summit?

07:11.097 --> 07:14.309
You can serve two years with her,
if you want.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.436
Or eight years with me.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.397
You choose the horse you want to back.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.652
Your resignation has
to be tendered within the hour.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.741
Madam President, remember
to allow us an adjustment in your heels

07:29.824 --> 07:31.451
so they don't engage the grass...

07:31.534 --> 07:34.621
Keep Kharkov on your right
so the stills have a clean shot of you

07:34.704 --> 07:36.289
- inspecting your troops...
- OK.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.124
Oh, and sir, protocol dictates

07:38.208 --> 07:41.169
that you kiss both
Mrs. Kharkova's cheeks in greeting.

07:41.252 --> 07:44.381
- Do I? Should I?
- Oh, no, ma'am. Just a handshake.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.425
We have covered
every potential scenario.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.552
Not every scenario, Madam President.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.805
- Excuse us, Nora.
- Oh, of course, Jim.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.848
Roman Wolfe called a press conference.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.476
Roman Wolfe? Why?

07:56.559 --> 08:00.313
Evidently his resignation letter
is waiting on your desk.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.566
Mm-hm.

08:05.110 --> 08:09.322
- [inhaling deeply] OK.
- Give us a moment, Jim.

08:10.657 --> 08:11.992
Of course.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.455
What do you think it says
when a member of my cabinet

08:17.539 --> 08:21.793
- quits on the day of my first summit?
- Oh, forget Wolfe. He doesn't matter.

08:21.876 --> 08:24.254
Right now,
this is about President Kharkov.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.132
It's about you.
It's about making history.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.719
Right now, you become this country.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.847
You're the United States of America.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.352
- OK. Let's do it.
- Mm-hm.

08:40.437 --> 08:43.857
[♪ Hail to the Chief]

08:44.399 --> 08:46.401
[guards] Ten-hut!

08:47.527 --> 08:50.864
[man] Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.544
[hip-hop music plays]

09:15.972 --> 09:18.141
[indistinct chatter]

09:22.312 --> 09:25.398
Hey. Um, I think you…

09:26.357 --> 09:28.193
Yeah, you were in my dream last night.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.153
- I'm... Almost for sure.
- Oh, yeah?

09:30.236 --> 09:33.656
- What was I doing, Jenny?
- I can't remember.

09:33.740 --> 09:37.243
But I'm pretty sure you were
wearing that shirt you have with the,

09:37.327 --> 09:41.331
uh, little red stripes.
We call it your candy cane shirt.

09:41.498 --> 09:44.250
Wait. You have a nickname for my shirt?

09:44.459 --> 09:46.795
Anyway...

09:52.842 --> 09:55.512
Man, she is so into you.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.348
Whatever, man. I like her.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.643
You know you don't have to like her,
Horace. Any of ‘em.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.563
- Gimme the ball.
- See? You got the perfect setup.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.483
- Come on.
- No, dude. You're the president's son.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.944
Every girl in our school
wants to lose it to you.

10:11.127 --> 10:12.545
- Not true.
- 'Course it is.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.614
Makes a great story
when she's old and fat

10:14.697 --> 10:17.784
and has nothing else in her life
but a bunch of high school memories.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.954
Horace! You took my biology book
and it had my homework in it.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.914
I had to take an incomplete. Thanks.

10:22.997 --> 10:26.953
No problem, I have bio next period. I'll
explain to Mrs. Hedison what happened.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.461
Hedison's a complete bitch.

10:28.545 --> 10:31.673
- Plus, she's got full-on BO.
- [chuckling] Totally.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.300
Gimme the ball, Flemming.

10:34.384 --> 10:38.012
Hey, Rebecca,
since Horace has never asked me...

10:38.096 --> 10:39.931
I don't know...

10:40.014 --> 10:43.685
Are you guys, like, allowed to have
guests over to the White House?

10:43.768 --> 10:46.563
Yeah. I can do whatever I want.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.608
Well, I'm free tonight.

10:53.945 --> 10:57.240
[Mac] I'd like to welcome President
Kharkov back to the United States.

10:57.991 --> 11:03.663
Perhaps I'll finally be able to beat one
American president in a round of golf.

11:03.872 --> 11:07.500
- [crowd laughing]
- Well, I have a pretty good short game.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.253
Welcome.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.505
[man] Madam President,

11:12.589 --> 11:15.633
as vice president you were
very vocal about President Kharkov

11:15.717 --> 11:18.428
and his government's crackdown
on democratic liberties.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.598
Where would I be without
you guys to remind me of my words?

11:22.307 --> 11:25.977
We have a very full agenda
of matters to discuss, privately.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.688
- [whispering] Get them out of here.
- Thank you.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.357
You'll have opportunities
at the press conference.

11:31.566 --> 11:34.652
What's it say about your
ability to lead, Madam President,

11:34.861 --> 11:37.822
when your security advisor
resigns on such an important day?

11:37.906 --> 11:41.367
The issue at hand
isn't this woman's ability to lead,

11:41.451 --> 11:44.495
but of her security advisor's
willingness to follow.

11:44.579 --> 11:47.624
[Kelly] OK. Thank you, everyone.
Thank you.

11:48.791 --> 11:49.751
That was great.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.253
Kharkov totally covered
for the president there.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.923
- He shut that question down.
- What? It was a disaster.

11:55.006 --> 11:58.092
He called her a woman.
She isn't a woman. She is a president.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.511
She's not a woman?

12:02.180 --> 12:06.434
Look, Alex. Every world leader is
watching this summit looking for clues,

12:06.517 --> 12:09.187
gestures. Whatever signals
they can read to figure out

12:09.270 --> 12:12.774
what kind of president
Mackenzie Allen is, besides female.

12:14.484 --> 12:18.446
[Rod] Mrs. Benjamin Harrison
started the collection of china.

12:18.655 --> 12:22.283
I especially like this
rococo revival punch bowl

12:22.367 --> 12:24.244
from the Pierce administration.

12:24.327 --> 12:28.831
Mrs. Harrison actually found
this bowl in the, uh, White House attic

12:28.915 --> 12:33.461
and had it mended
and then put on display.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.256
Ever wonder how it came to be broken?

12:38.424 --> 12:41.803
Well, maybe the, uh, punch was spiked.

12:41.886 --> 12:46.724
Oh, so one night, your President Pierce
had too much to drink...

12:46.933 --> 12:51.688
And suddenly, a presidential mistake
became a national treasure.

12:54.691 --> 12:58.695
But in the end, I feel that I can
no longer be of efficient service

12:58.778 --> 13:01.739
to this country, or to this president.

13:01.990 --> 13:05.201
[reporter] Is there an
inciting incident to this resignation?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.078
- [intercom beeping]
- [Roman] No...

13:07.161 --> 13:10.290
- Yeah.
- [woman] Secretary of interior's here.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.458
[reporter] Did the president ask you...?

13:12.542 --> 13:14.836
Hold him for two minutes,
then send him in.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.129
[Roman] I had a meeting…

13:16.212 --> 13:18.298
- Send me in some coffee, please.
- Yes, sir.

13:18.381 --> 13:21.301
[reporter] How'd the president
react to your resignation?

13:21.384 --> 13:24.595
That is between the president and me.

13:24.679 --> 13:28.891
So we're not going to proceed with
the sale of nuclear fuel to Būshehr...

13:29.434 --> 13:32.812
Until the Iranians have met
all their international obligations.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.440
And satisfy the community
that they have abandoned

13:35.523 --> 13:38.568
- their nuclear weapons program.
- [man] Next.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.988
Regarding Russia's entry
into the World Trade Organization.

13:42.071 --> 13:45.325
There's no real update there.
You know that's up to the WTO.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.076
That remains beyond our purview.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.707
We'll revisit that item. Let's move on.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.585
Did you know there are 132 rooms
in the White House?

13:55.668 --> 13:59.589
Yes. But did you also know
there are 16 refrigerators?

13:59.672 --> 14:02.300
Now, technically,
we're not even supposed to be

14:02.383 --> 14:04.469
in the Cabinet Room
without the president.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.512
But I think we're
gonna get away with it.

14:06.596 --> 14:07.930
[both chuckle]

14:08.598 --> 14:11.476
- You used to be her chief of staff.
- [Rod murmurs]

14:11.559 --> 14:14.187
How are you finding your new position?

14:14.270 --> 14:17.023
Well, I'm not sure that
I would call it a, uh, position.

14:17.106 --> 14:21.319
[chuckles] It's just that I used to be,
uh, so much more than a spouse.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.446
Oh, yes. Me too.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.616
[whispering] Mrs. Kharkova, um...

14:26.699 --> 14:29.118
Before this,
you were a well-respected attorney.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.788
[Rod] So tell me the truth.

14:31.871 --> 14:35.124
Don't you feel that this job
is just a little limiting?

14:37.835 --> 14:42.840
[whispering] That is only the job,
if that's what you make of the job.

14:44.634 --> 14:48.054
[man] Item seven on the agenda.
Sturgeon hatcheries on the Volga River.

14:48.137 --> 14:51.057
- Which we thought might...
- Mr. President, if I may.

14:51.516 --> 14:54.727
I wonder if we could table
the discussion of caviar, for now,

14:54.811 --> 14:57.146
and move on to some
of the more pressing issues.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.404
Madam President, surely
you can see how our staffs thought

15:04.487 --> 15:07.907
a billion-dollar industry
warranted our full attention.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.451
- And I don't disagree,
- [clearing throat]

15:10.535 --> 15:13.246
However, there are
more urgent matters in our agenda.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.249
Months of preparation
with the previous administration

15:16.332 --> 15:18.918
have produced a very thoughtful agenda.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.754
One which should guide us,
rather than constrain us.

15:21.838 --> 15:24.257
- I'd prefer to go in order.
- I know you would...

15:24.340 --> 15:26.426
[Jim] This may be a
good time to take a break.

15:26.509 --> 15:30.179
Give both sides a chance
to prepare for the press conference.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.516
Lots of progress to report to the press.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.312
- [Nora] Here we are.
- Hello.

15:40.398 --> 15:43.317
It really makes them feel good
to see you down here, sir.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.611
- Game day and all.
- My pleasure.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.780
Oh, you have to smell these roses.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.950
Yellow roses. Mrs. Kharkova's favorite.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.661
- Did my homework.
- Ah...

15:53.744 --> 15:57.540
[gasping] Hands! Hands!
The petals brown with fingerprints...

15:58.541 --> 16:00.376
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi, Rebecca.

16:01.085 --> 16:02.962
Um, hey, you have a sec?

16:03.045 --> 16:07.133
- You smell that? It's nice, huh?
- Yes. Roses. Very, very nice.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.385
Yellow roses. Over a thousand of them.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.430
- For tonight's dinner.
- Yeah. About tonight's dinner.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.682
- You're going.
- Dad, that's not fair.

16:14.765 --> 16:15.808
You're going.

16:15.892 --> 16:19.312
None of my friends have to go to
their parents' stupid business things.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.982
I'm sorry. It's important
to your mother. Case closed.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.028
[Rod] Nora.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.279
[sighing]

16:31.574 --> 16:33.326
How is the morning playing?

16:33.409 --> 16:36.329
- Truthfully, not great.
- Roman Wolfe's resignation...

16:36.412 --> 16:39.916
Will be below the fold, buried beneath
the success of today's summit.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.126
- [Jim] Madam President.
- Jim.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.588
- I know what you're going to say...
- No, you don't.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.466
If you did, you wouldn't have tried
to handle me like that.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.510
- I was trying to protect you.
- I'm gonna…

16:50.593 --> 16:53.513
- I think that we should…
- Uh, you hang back, Kelly.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.601
We have a bigger problem.

16:58.684 --> 17:02.271
A bigger problem than not having
the support of my chief of staff?

17:02.522 --> 17:04.982
- Secretary Witherspoon's resigned.
- What?

17:05.066 --> 17:08.361
Charlie Witherspoon?

17:08.444 --> 17:12.781
Oh, what a town.
You can't even trust the backstabbers.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.536
The national security advisor
and the secretary of the interior

17:16.618 --> 17:20.248
both resign on the day of the summit.
What is going on here, Jim?

17:20.330 --> 17:23.376
- I have a theory.
- Probably the same theory I have.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.587
Don't you think it's about time
you paid a visit to Capitol Hill?

17:27.463 --> 17:28.548
Yes, ma'am.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.970
- [door closing]
- [Rod] Charlie's here.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.181
- Oh, hey, Charlie. Good to see you.
- Madam President.

17:37.265 --> 17:40.101
- It's been what, a year?
- Yes, I think so.

17:40.810 --> 17:44.063
So, uh, thank you for seeing me today.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.233
Of course. What's up, Mr. Secretary?
What can I do for you?

17:47.450 --> 17:49.610
- Well...
- Charlie's been hearing some rumblings.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.153
- Oh?
- [dog whining]

17:51.237 --> 17:54.574
Well, what with
the president's condition and all...

17:54.657 --> 17:59.537
We're all well aware that Jim Gardner
and Melanie Blackston came to see you

17:59.620 --> 18:01.998
to ask you to step down, and, uh...

18:02.081 --> 18:04.250
Well, there's just been some talk.

18:05.001 --> 18:09.755
The cabinet knows that you haven't
said yes and, uh, well, ma'am...

18:09.839 --> 18:13.092
These guys can be,
uh, pretty Machiavellian.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.135
I see.

18:14.218 --> 18:18.931
I just wanted you to know that,
for me, I'm at your service.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.766
Good to know.

18:20.850 --> 18:25.938
What I'm saying is, you know,
I could be your eyes and ears.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.691
Let you know where
the knives are coming from.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.568
There will be knives?

18:30.651 --> 18:32.612
- [dog barking]
- [Charlie] Yeah.

18:32.695 --> 18:35.031
I, for one, would be
very much in support of you.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.826
The Department of Interior would very
much welcome a woman's point of view.

18:38.909 --> 18:43.247
Women are much more,
uh, environmentally friendly.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.708
Well, we do tend
to pick up after ourselves.

18:49.045 --> 18:51.130
- Uh-oh!
- [all laugh]

18:51.213 --> 18:55.968
OK, OK. Well, Charlie,
thank you for stopping by.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.720
- Right.
- OK.

18:57.803 --> 18:58.804
Bye, girl.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.643
Hey, Charlie, you really think

19:03.726 --> 19:06.437
a woman'd be better
for the Department of Interior?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.773
Sure. Absolutely.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.401
Perhaps we should have
a woman running it then.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.446
Kidding.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.073
Ah...

19:20.117 --> 19:21.952
[Vince] Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am?

19:22.036 --> 19:24.955
- The press conference is set to begin.
- Thank you, Vince.

19:25.039 --> 19:27.041
Uh, do me a favor.

19:27.124 --> 19:30.795
I need a copy of Oliver Chitwood's
biography of John Tyler.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.089
- President Tyler?
- Yeah. That's the guy.

19:35.925 --> 19:36.884
[Kelly sighs]

19:36.967 --> 19:39.345
You know what's gonna
happen in there, don't you?

19:39.428 --> 19:40.554
I'm afraid I do, ma'am.

19:40.638 --> 19:44.558
They're gonna hit me with resignations.
The summit is gonna be secondary.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.852
You know, I can handle their questions.

19:46.936 --> 19:49.605
What I can't handle
is having to go in there

19:49.689 --> 19:52.692
and pretend he's some sort of…
champion of democracy.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.485
Maybe it's for the greater good?

19:54.694 --> 19:57.154
That what the guys who
came before me told themselves?

19:57.363 --> 19:58.239
Guess so.

19:58.447 --> 20:02.243
[sighing] I just… I don't know.

20:02.326 --> 20:05.454
I thought we were
gonna do things differently.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.998
- [reporters clamoring]
- Next.

20:08.082 --> 20:11.252
Madam President. Can you comment
on today's cabinet resignations?

20:11.460 --> 20:15.172
We're here to comment on the progress
made between our two nations. Next.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.133
- [clamoring]
- Samantha.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.219
Has there been a breakthrough
on the Caspian oil pipeline?

20:20.302 --> 20:26.100
The pipeline agreement was the result
of negotiations with President Bridges.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.603
Its completion will be
a testimony to his vision.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.897
[clamoring]

20:31.981 --> 20:36.152
Changing topics. President Allen, has
there been progress on civil liberties?

20:36.318 --> 20:38.112
- Actually...
- Allow me.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.216
- Of course.
- [Kharkov] Thank you.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.992
The Russia of today
looks dramatically different

20:43.159 --> 20:45.202
than the Russia of just ten years ago.

20:45.411 --> 20:49.165
However, each day brings new challenges.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.917
Certainly President Allen knows that,

20:52.001 --> 20:54.712
with the sudden loss
of her cabinet members.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.299
[all clamoring] Madam President!

21:03.512 --> 21:07.641
Our leadership may change,
but our democratic principles do not.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.604
What remains to be seen
is what President Kharkov,

21:11.687 --> 21:13.272
a man who talks about democracy,

21:13.355 --> 21:16.692
will do in a situation
that requires more than just talk.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.945
If it truly is time for change,

21:20.029 --> 21:24.492
then it is time to free the dissident
journalists jailed in your prisons,

21:24.700 --> 21:27.870
- Mr. President.
- [reporters clamoring]

21:31.832 --> 21:35.336
I don't even know why you're bothering
with Mom when Dad already said no.

21:35.419 --> 21:39.298
If you wanna see Flemming so bad, why
don't you bring him to the state dinner?

21:39.381 --> 21:41.467
The point is
to be alone with him, Horace.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.094
I don't think you know
what you're getting into.

21:44.178 --> 21:46.680
- You do not know Flemming like I do.
- Yeah, Horace.

21:46.764 --> 21:50.643
Just 'cause you're four minutes older
doesn't mean you have all the answers.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.312
So, you just mind
your own business, OK?

21:53.395 --> 21:54.647
I know what I'm doing.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.775
No. You don't understand
what I'm trying to tell you...

21:57.858 --> 22:00.110
Today was the first day
that didn't suck for me

22:00.194 --> 22:03.989
since we moved into this house.
So, please, just let me have this.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.991
- Hey, Horace. Hi, Rebecca.
- Hi, Vince.

22:06.075 --> 22:08.786
Hey, um, Vince. Is my mom, um, busy?

22:09.411 --> 22:12.832
She always has time for you.
I think she's in with Kelly. I'll check.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.500
Thanks.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.586
I can't believe I took the bait.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.923
- I should have just left it alone.
- Ma'am, it wasn't that bad.

22:21.006 --> 22:24.051
We have no room for error here.
This is a very partisan town.

22:24.134 --> 22:26.595
It's not like I have
a lot of allies in either party.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.515
- And it had to be said.
- Maybe just not so publicly.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.101
Excuse me, ma'am.
Rebecca's here to see you.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.520
Oh. Great. One second.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.146
Thanks. We're done here, Kelly.

22:40.818 --> 22:43.654
- Hey, Rebecca. Hi, Horace.
- Oh, hey, Kelly, what's up?

22:43.737 --> 22:46.073
Uh… nothing. How you guys doing?

22:46.156 --> 22:48.492
Good. How's the,
uh, speechwriting coming?

22:48.576 --> 22:51.370
- Good. See you guys later.
- OK.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.998
- All right.
- Nice work.

22:54.081 --> 22:57.459
You know, she's been press secretary
for, like, two weeks now.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.380
[phone ringing]

23:01.463 --> 23:03.549
- Hey, you.
- Hey, Mom.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.385
Oh… Nice to see a friendly face.

23:08.429 --> 23:11.140
Um, Mom, I had a question,
but, I mean, if you're busy...

23:11.223 --> 23:12.766
- Oh, no.
- [Vince] Sorry, ma'am.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.894
It's the White House operator.
It's Nora.

23:14.977 --> 23:17.813
Uh, would you tell her to hold,
please? What is it?

23:17.897 --> 23:22.234
Um, well, I was wondering if
I could skip this state dinner tonight?

23:22.318 --> 23:25.654
- Oh, Becca. I was hoping...
- Madam President.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.907
Nora implied that it
was a matter of urgency.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.742
Of course it is.

23:29.825 --> 23:35.122
It's just… I have to study
for this huge test, um, with a friend.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.333
- [Vince] Ma'am?
- [Mac] OK.

23:37.416 --> 23:41.170
- [exhaling] Um, Mom...?
- I don't know, Becca.

23:41.253 --> 23:44.506
You know? Why don't you
just follow your conscience?

23:47.593 --> 23:50.554
Vince. Any luck
on that John Tyler biography?

23:50.638 --> 23:53.849
- Did you find it yet?
- Uh, no, ma'am. We're still searching.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.269
What is it, Nora?

23:57.353 --> 23:59.188
Wait. Slow down.

24:01.148 --> 24:03.484
What did they say exactly?

24:05.819 --> 24:07.321
OK, just...

24:07.404 --> 24:10.616
Just keep this quiet
and continue business as usual.

24:10.699 --> 24:11.909
Thank you, Nora.

24:11.992 --> 24:13.410
[phone hanging up]

24:14.536 --> 24:17.289
It seems the Russian president
has suddenly taken ill.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.250
He's still coming
to the state dinner, right?

24:20.501 --> 24:22.378
I don't know.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.755
[Jim] What did you promise them, Nate?

24:24.964 --> 24:27.591
- Is there anybody else?
- Yeah. Sure. Sure there is.

24:27.675 --> 24:29.885
- And who's that?
- Francis.

24:30.052 --> 24:34.807
And not Francis Barnes at Agriculture.
Mills Francis at Defense.

24:34.890 --> 24:38.143
If Teddy were here to see what you
were doing, he'd have your head...

24:38.227 --> 24:41.355
If Teddy were alive to see this,
it wouldn't be necessary…

24:44.984 --> 24:46.568
[sighing] Sit.

24:53.117 --> 24:55.452
Three resignations.

24:55.536 --> 24:59.623
And if you think that's embarrassing,
you just wait till you see what happens

24:59.707 --> 25:03.043
when she tries to get her nominees
for those positions confirmed.

25:03.127 --> 25:06.296
- Nate, we're trying...
- No, no. Come on, please.

25:06.380 --> 25:10.342
You're not gonna touch me
with your self-righteous indignation.

25:10.426 --> 25:13.303
You want her gone just as much as I do.

25:13.387 --> 25:16.223
- It ends.
- It's just begun. Sit down.

25:18.058 --> 25:20.060
Please, Jim. Sit.

25:25.274 --> 25:26.942
I want you to resign.

25:27.026 --> 25:31.196
You can take till the end of the month.
Whatever. I want you to resign as well.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.364
Why would I do that?

25:32.448 --> 25:36.368
When I become president I want you
to join the others in my administration.

25:36.452 --> 25:39.371
I'm not sure if I could stomach it.
Being your chief of staff?

25:39.455 --> 25:41.457
I don't want you
to be my chief of staff.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.667
I want you to be my vice president.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.589
Now that got your attention, didn't it?

25:48.672 --> 25:50.382
[sighs]

25:50.466 --> 25:53.427
First African American vice president.

25:54.344 --> 25:56.430
You and me, Jim.

25:56.513 --> 25:59.808
We can save this country.
We can save it from her.

26:01.143 --> 26:04.688
And don't you think
about your loyalty to the office.

26:06.273 --> 26:10.569
You think about your loyalty
to your people.

26:20.162 --> 26:23.040
I'm gonna need your answer
by the state dinner.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.001
You'll have it.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.338
Good.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.430
[Mac] Oh, Mrs. Kharkova.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.682
I didn't realize you were still here.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.935
I was just looking for my husband.

26:43.018 --> 26:46.730
Mmm... The first gentleman
is in the kitchen addressing a crisis.

26:46.814 --> 26:51.193
[chuckling] I'm sure he was
thrilled with that responsibility.

26:51.276 --> 26:54.571
He has been a gracious host.

26:54.655 --> 26:58.867
Ah... So, you saw the press conference.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.579
You know,
this summit almost didn't happen.

27:02.663 --> 27:05.749
My husband wanted to cancel the visit.

27:05.833 --> 27:08.877
He would never admit it, but, um,

27:08.961 --> 27:12.131
I think he was intimidated
to meet you, Madam President.

27:12.214 --> 27:16.969
- Why would he be intimidated by me?
- Your reputation precedes you.

27:17.052 --> 27:20.139
He was afraid you were
gonna put him on the spot.

27:20.222 --> 27:21.723
And you did.

27:21.807 --> 27:24.893
President Bridges
never would have done that.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.979
I spoke my mind.

27:27.062 --> 27:29.314
- That shouldn't be so intimidating.
- Mmm.

27:30.065 --> 27:33.485
As much as Americans claim
to be students of history,

27:33.569 --> 27:35.696
they forget their own.

27:35.779 --> 27:39.700
We are just 15 years into the
experiment that your country

27:39.783 --> 27:42.786
continues after 200 years.

27:42.870 --> 27:45.706
It took you 90 years
to get rid of slavery,

27:45.789 --> 27:49.376
and 150 to give women the right to vote.

27:50.335 --> 27:53.172
- It's not always easy.
- No.

27:53.255 --> 27:56.925
You and my husband
are both independent thinkers

27:57.009 --> 28:02.264
who struggle each day against a people
who seek to protect the status quo.

28:07.102 --> 28:11.648
Mrs. Kharkova,
I sincerely hope that your husband

28:11.732 --> 28:14.651
is feeling well enough
to attend tonight's state dinner.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.156
Is there anything I can get him?

28:19.239 --> 28:21.283
Chicken soup, perhaps?

28:22.659 --> 28:24.661
There is one thing.

28:25.454 --> 28:28.624
- And I'm guessing it's not soup.
- [Mrs. Kharkova chuckles]

28:28.707 --> 28:32.002
Fast-track our entry
into the World Trade Organization.

28:34.796 --> 28:38.300
Uh, technically,
I'm not in control of the WTO.

28:38.383 --> 28:41.887
Oh. Well, technically,
my husband isn't in control

28:41.970 --> 28:44.056
of releasing the dissident journalists.

28:46.808 --> 28:48.977
I see.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.689
I'm so glad we had a chance to talk.

28:52.773 --> 28:54.858
- Me too.
- Thank you.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.741
[indistinct chatter]

29:11.333 --> 29:13.001
[man] Good. Yes.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.441
[sighing] I'm never gonna get this.
I'm gonna be in summer school.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.360
It's easy. See, according to Mendel,

29:38.443 --> 29:40.946
a dominant gene
will always express itself.

29:41.029 --> 29:44.700
- Like… curly hair.
- [both laugh]

29:44.783 --> 29:47.286
- [Rebecca] Thanks.
- [Flemming] I'm serious.

29:50.330 --> 29:53.250
- [Rod] What's going on here, Rebecca?
- I'm… studying.

29:53.333 --> 29:56.878
- A-ha. And you are…?
- Mike Flemming, sir.

29:56.962 --> 30:00.590
Hi, Mike. Can I speak to you
for a moment in private?

30:00.674 --> 30:04.469
- Um… sure.
- Great.

30:04.553 --> 30:06.471
[Rebecca] One sec.

30:07.723 --> 30:10.142
[Rod] Why aren't you dressed
for the state dinner?

30:10.225 --> 30:12.352
- I'm not going.
- Go get dressed right now.

30:12.436 --> 30:14.813
There's too much going on
for you to pull one of...

30:14.896 --> 30:16.440
No, no, no. Mom said it was cool.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.526
- [sighing] Really?
- Yeah.

30:19.693 --> 30:21.445
[grunts]

30:24.740 --> 30:26.742
[Rebecca] Sorry ‘bout that.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.579
- Is everything cool?
- Yeah. It's fine.

30:30.662 --> 30:34.082
- Study hard.
- Say hi to Kelly for me.

30:37.878 --> 30:41.923
[whispering] Hey. I don't want you
leaving your sister's side this evening.

30:42.007 --> 30:45.302
No. I'm not staying in there
with her stupid boyfriend.

30:45.385 --> 30:47.012
Just do it, OK?

30:47.095 --> 30:48.930
You can stay up as late as you want.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.642
Fine. You can play my video games.

30:55.604 --> 30:57.230
[both laughing]

30:58.065 --> 30:59.941
Excuse me.

31:03.070 --> 31:04.863
[sighing, chuckling]

31:04.946 --> 31:08.367
- Hi, Amy.
- Hi, Rebecca.

31:08.450 --> 31:09.451
[door opening]

31:10.786 --> 31:11.745
Hey.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.997
Why'd you tell Rebecca
she didn't have to come?

31:14.081 --> 31:15.040
What do you mean?

31:15.123 --> 31:19.336
I told her she had to. You said
she didn't. You said that it was cool.

31:19.419 --> 31:22.047
Cool? Does that sound
like something I would say?

31:22.130 --> 31:26.468
Listen. When it comes to our kids,
if I say something, that's gotta matter.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.387
Do you really want to get into this now?

31:28.470 --> 31:29.471
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.598
It's not the first time
the kids have tried

31:31.681 --> 31:34.309
- to play us against each other.
- That's not the point.

31:36.019 --> 31:38.355
Our first state dinner
is in ten minutes.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.816
Could this possibly wait two hours?

31:44.194 --> 31:47.030
How do we know Kharkov'll even show up?

31:47.114 --> 31:51.243
Well, I have to think if their
relationship is anything like ours,

31:51.326 --> 31:54.996
Mrs. Kharkova will have
a great deal of influence.

31:56.081 --> 31:58.667
- Nora.
- Madam President, bright news.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.628
We've been notified the
Russian delegation's on their way.

32:01.711 --> 32:03.547
[sighs]

32:05.090 --> 32:06.883
- [police sirens wail]
- Thank you.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.428
[man] Attention!

32:32.409 --> 32:34.786
- Madam Kharkova.
- Madam President.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.705
- Madam Kharkova.
- President Kharkov.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.583
I'm so pleased you decided
to join us this evening.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.877
I'm not here for you.

32:43.295 --> 32:46.298
I am here for my wife. And my country.

32:47.215 --> 32:50.218
[Kharkov] As far as I'm concerned,
we're nowhere.

32:58.894 --> 33:03.190
Speaker of the house, Nathan Templeton,
and his aide, Jayne Murray.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.819
- Mr. Speaker.
- Madam President. Mr. First Gentleman.

33:07.903 --> 33:11.948
- Nathan.
- My wife regrets… apologizes.

33:12.032 --> 33:14.117
She still has not yet recovered.

33:14.826 --> 33:19.623
- You give her my best.
- She'll appreciate that. Thank you.

33:19.706 --> 33:23.335
You've had quite a day.
You get an A for comportment.

33:24.794 --> 33:27.297
You remember my chief of staff,
Jayne Murray.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.882
Jayne.

33:28.965 --> 33:31.968
[speaking Russian]

33:33.345 --> 33:35.889
- Madame.
- [speaks Russian]

33:37.057 --> 33:38.767
[Jayne] Nice to meet you.

33:48.360 --> 33:53.240
[Mac] October 4, 1957 was a
disappointing day in American history.

33:54.449 --> 33:57.369
It's the day we lost the space race.

33:57.452 --> 33:59.663
When Americans looked skyward,

33:59.746 --> 34:04.125
we could see just the faintest glimmer
of the Soviet Union's success.

34:04.209 --> 34:07.212
Sputnik was launched that day.

34:07.295 --> 34:11.007
On the other side of the world,
a young aeronautical engineer

34:11.091 --> 34:14.052
looked to our shared sky
with great pride.

34:14.135 --> 34:17.179
Anatoly Kharkov,
President Kharkov's father,

34:17.264 --> 34:20.225
was just 26 years old at the time.

34:20.308 --> 34:23.143
Anatoly Kharkov was an innovator.

34:23.228 --> 34:25.230
He played a key role in bringing

34:25.313 --> 34:29.109
one of the the most vital tools
of democracy to the world.

34:29.192 --> 34:30.652
Communication.

34:31.820 --> 34:35.031
Barriers have been broken,
walls have crumbled.

34:35.114 --> 34:37.576
But there's still
a lot of work to be done.

34:37.659 --> 34:43.039
If we hope for a peaceful
and prosperous future,

34:43.123 --> 34:47.502
then we must put aside
our personal agenda...

34:49.838 --> 34:52.716
...and stand
shoulder to shoulder together.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.180
Thank you.

35:03.393 --> 35:04.603
[speaking Russian]

35:06.354 --> 35:09.774
- [speaking Russian]
- [all cheering and clapping]

35:20.702 --> 35:23.163
[crowd chattering]

35:23.246 --> 35:25.665
- Thanks.
- No problem.

35:29.502 --> 35:31.880
You do look good in a tux, Mr. Gardner.

35:32.839 --> 35:35.008
Hmm.

35:35.091 --> 35:37.260
He needs your answer now.

35:43.850 --> 35:46.478
Man, if I was your age
I'd be crawling out of my skin.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.521
What, are you kidding?
I love this stuff.

35:48.605 --> 35:50.398
Guess it's ‘cause I'm pretty mature.

35:54.944 --> 35:57.781
[video game beeping]

36:11.628 --> 36:14.172
- All danced out, Grace?
- [Grace chuckles]

36:14.255 --> 36:15.382
May I?

36:17.258 --> 36:21.596
- [sighing] I miss Teddy.
- He was a great president.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.516
Congratulations.
It was a lovely evening.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.768
[Rod] These, uh, last two years,

36:26.851 --> 36:31.272
I had no idea how much thought
and attention was given to every detail.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.942
You always made everything look so easy.

36:35.819 --> 36:38.446
Rod, seeing your wife up there tonight,

36:38.530 --> 36:41.032
she made it clear she is the president.

36:42.117 --> 36:45.370
Suddenly, I just feel like I'm
a guest in someone else's home.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.580
Oh, you know you're
always welcome here...

36:47.664 --> 36:49.416
One who has overstayed.

36:50.834 --> 36:53.044
It's your home now. You belong here.

36:57.465 --> 36:59.384
- Good night.
- Good night.

37:13.064 --> 37:16.109
Madam President, here you go.

37:16.192 --> 37:19.070
One Oliver Chitwood biography
of President John Tyler.

37:19.154 --> 37:20.780
- Piece of cake.
- Really?

37:20.864 --> 37:23.700
Well, let's say there's
a shop owner in Georgetown

37:23.783 --> 37:26.161
who may be attending
our next state dinner.

37:26.995 --> 37:29.205
- May-May I ask why?
- Uh...

37:29.289 --> 37:31.291
Our tenth president, John Tyler.

37:31.374 --> 37:33.501
Not a lot of people know,
he was the first VP

37:33.585 --> 37:37.422
to take over the presidency,
when Harrison died in office.

37:37.505 --> 37:39.716
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

37:39.799 --> 37:45.305
His enemies tried to undermine him
by forcing Harrison's cabinet to resign.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.767
But they didn't think it through.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.811
Ended up making Tyler
even more powerful.

37:52.854 --> 37:55.523
- Bedside reading?
- Yeah, just not for my bedside.

37:58.985 --> 38:01.029
- Yes, ma'am.
- [chuckles]

38:08.369 --> 38:09.829
[Nathan chuckles]

38:09.913 --> 38:11.289
Busted.

38:12.207 --> 38:13.374
Mr. Speaker.

38:14.375 --> 38:17.212
Uh-huh. "Mr. Speaker."

38:18.213 --> 38:20.882
When it's all said and done,
the woman is our president.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.551
She deserves the benefit
of the doubt, a chance...

38:23.635 --> 38:24.719
Stop.

38:25.136 --> 38:29.307
You can't give her,
you can't give anybody a chance.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.894
You don't learn to be
the president on the job.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.438
The stakes are too high, Jim.

38:35.522 --> 38:38.775
The president has to be
the president from the get-go.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.653
You're right.

38:41.736 --> 38:43.655
And maybe you'd
be better at it than her.

38:45.198 --> 38:47.575
But Teddy gave you
an opportunity and you said no.

38:48.618 --> 38:50.078
You put her in office.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.497
Way I see it, you owe it
to the country to make sure

38:52.580 --> 38:54.749
she's the best president she can be.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.919
- Think about your people, Nate.
- My people?

38:58.002 --> 38:59.587
The American people.

39:03.550 --> 39:05.885
OK.

39:05.969 --> 39:08.888
It's a mistake, Jim. But OK.

39:10.431 --> 39:13.226
Jayne looks lovely
in her dress, doesn't she?

39:14.185 --> 39:17.939
- Yeah, she does.
- Enjoy your evening.

39:19.232 --> 39:22.402
Madam President,
would you like to dance?

39:23.903 --> 39:25.864
I'd be delighted.

39:25.947 --> 39:28.199
Thank you.

39:28.283 --> 39:29.534
Excuse me, Mr. President.

39:29.617 --> 39:33.037
But I need to borrow
our president on an urgent matter.

39:33.121 --> 39:35.415
Excuse me.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.044
- Alex?
- It's just not done.

39:40.128 --> 39:41.838
- What?
- You.

39:41.921 --> 39:45.884
- You can't dance with Kharkov.
- Why? Is he a bad dancer?

39:45.967 --> 39:48.261
- A good dancer?
- It's just unprecedented.

39:48.344 --> 39:50.263
- What do you think I am?
- Everything OK?

39:50.346 --> 39:51.347
We've hit a hiccup.

39:51.431 --> 39:54.017
President Kharkov wants
to dance with our president.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.895
World leaders cannot...
Shouldn't be dancing together.

39:56.978 --> 39:58.062
What's the protocol?

39:58.146 --> 40:01.232
- We're trying to figure that out.
- It cannot be that big of a deal.

40:01.316 --> 40:03.401
- Are you out of your mind?
- [Kelly] Alex...

40:03.484 --> 40:05.194
Ma'am, I think...

40:06.988 --> 40:09.490
Our staffs must think
this is inappropriate.

40:09.574 --> 40:12.535
Dmitry, we are the world's leaders.

40:12.619 --> 40:15.204
I think we can decide
what's appropriate.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.249
Thank you for asking me to dance.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.210
Acknowledging my father.
It meant a lot to me.

40:21.294 --> 40:25.882
I didn't see much of him as a boy,
but his contribution outlives him.

40:28.801 --> 40:32.764
I'll do everything in my power
to provide an assistance package

40:32.847 --> 40:36.476
that allows Russia to qualify
for entry into the WTO.

40:37.185 --> 40:41.064
I will give the matter of the dissident
journalists the attention it deserves.

40:44.484 --> 40:47.862
- Is she leading?
- She's leading, all right.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.364
[crowd clapping]

40:49.864 --> 40:52.325
Good evening. Mr. Speaker.

40:52.408 --> 40:54.494
A gift from the president.

40:57.830 --> 40:59.499
President Tyler?

41:00.959 --> 41:02.919
That's her counterpunch.

41:03.002 --> 41:05.463
I slip it and we go to round two.

41:06.547 --> 41:09.926
Clever girl.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.136
