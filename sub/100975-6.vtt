00:33.575 --> 00:34.659
-Yeah.
-I do.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.704
"His name is Ryan Dyer,
aka DJ High Def."

00:37.787 --> 00:38.913
He's a DJ?

00:38.997 --> 00:40.707
[dance music playing]

00:41.416 --> 00:45.253
[Ryan] I work as an MC DJ at three
of the biggest venues in New Jersey.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.760
That's who I am. [laughs]

00:52.177 --> 00:56.264
[Antoni] "Ryan is 37 years old, and his
hometown is Point Pleasant, New Jersey.

00:56.639 --> 01:00.060
He is a property manager by day
and DJ High Def by night."

Why don't you come take a look
at where I do my adulting?

01:06.232 --> 01:09.694
This is our lovely assistant Nicole.
She's the first person you see.

01:09.778 --> 01:12.322
This is Joseph. This is my little brother.

01:12.405 --> 01:16.367
My father started a property management
company ten years ago,

01:16.451 --> 01:18.244
and I handle a lot of maintenance

01:18.328 --> 01:20.246
at a bunch of different properties.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.708
[Antoni] "He's the middle child
of a tight-knit Italian-American family."

01:23.792 --> 01:25.668
The "troubled" one. [laughs]

01:25.752 --> 01:28.671
"His brothers are married with kids,
but Ryan hasn't settled down yet."

01:29.089 --> 01:32.884
My older brother has three boys,
and I am very much the cool uncle.

01:32.967 --> 01:36.054
-Ry-Ry! Say hello to Uncle Ry-Ry, kids.
-Give me kisses.

[Antoni] "He wants to marry
and start a family like his brothers,

01:39.432 --> 01:41.392
but right now,
he's not meeting the right women."

01:41.476 --> 01:43.394
Here's an idea.
Maybe he's not looking for women.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.396
[Tan]
Maybe he's looking for the right man.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.566
Excuse me, everyone.
Maybe he's looking for the right...

01:49.359 --> 01:50.276

-Person.

Jeff and Susan."

01:57.659 --> 01:58.785
That's sweet.

01:58.868 --> 02:02.205
Ryan has a really good heart.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.417
But I believe this DJ business
is holding him back,

02:06.501 --> 02:10.421
and I feel that something is missing
in his own life

02:10.505 --> 02:12.924
that would give him
that happiness and joy.

02:13.007 --> 02:15.176
Come here, princess. Atta baby girl.

02:15.260 --> 02:18.138
He craves for the love and attention.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.014
He has a little puppy that he loves,

02:20.098 --> 02:22.684

02:22.767 --> 02:24.644
[Antoni]
"A few years back, Ryan purchased a house

02:24.727 --> 02:26.521
with the intention
of making it his family home."

02:26.604 --> 02:28.189
So he bought a house
before having a family?

02:28.273 --> 02:29.566
If you build it, they will come.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.776
Oh, it's kind of like girls
buying a wedding dress

02:31.860 --> 02:33.695
-before they meet the person.
-Yes.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.864

-What's going on, bro?

[Antoni] "Instead of a wife and kids,

02:37.115 --> 02:40.285
he currently has two roommates
who also work in the nightlife industry."

02:40.368 --> 02:41.619
[chuckles] So they're like placeholders.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.038
"It feels more like a frat house
than a family home."

02:44.122 --> 02:45.790
Maybe he likes to be, like, a partier.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.376
I believe it hasn't become his family home

02:48.459 --> 02:51.462
because he doesn't have time
to meet the right person.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.799

I just wish my family was more supportive

02:54.883 --> 02:56.509
of my DJ industry career.

02:57.635 --> 03:00.096
Maybe there's things,
maybe it's the way he's dressing.

03:00.597 --> 03:03.099
[Antoni] "He's been sporting the same look
since he first started DJ-ing

03:03.183 --> 03:05.310
at age 21, but he's now 37."

03:05.393 --> 03:06.269
Wow.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.270
He's committed.

03:07.353 --> 03:10.648
I don't think girls are looking
for that kind of thing right now.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.108
I could be wrong, but...

03:12.192 --> 03:13.067
[man] A piece of sausage?

dinners once a week at his parents' house,

to the table."

ain't no one gonna eat anyway.

-Opportunity for change.
-Mm-hmm.

03:24.162 --> 03:27.165
I think even though he, on the side,

03:27.248 --> 03:29.417
does, you know, DJ-ing,

03:29.918 --> 03:32.629
I think Ryan is not happy

03:32.712 --> 03:36.257
because he's really missing
that significant other in his life.

03:36.674 --> 03:38.676

I think if he's happy with himself,

03:38.760 --> 03:40.970
then he could be happy with someone else.

-Okay, that's long.
-Get out of there.

04:35.692 --> 04:36.818

-Topless wonder.

[Antoni] Tan, you wanna help him?

04:40.947 --> 04:42.532
[Bobby] You're putting shorts over shorts?

04:42.615 --> 04:44.284
[Ryan] Yeah. Just when I go tanning.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.911
I put them on,
and then it's easy to just take off.

04:47.328 --> 04:48.997
I am a married man.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.456

-[Bobby] Why?

06:06.407 --> 06:09.202
-'Cause you like crusty sheets?
-No, I-- [laughs]

of horrors.

[Bobby] Why is there a queen-size bed--

06:22.507 --> 06:24.425
[Karamo] What is going on here?
This is very interesting,

06:24.509 --> 06:26.552
-this tiger-print piece.
-[Ryan] Well, I have--

06:26.636 --> 06:28.721
-I have tigers and...
-[Bobby] Tasteful.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.098
-You know.
-Not tasteful.

06:30.181 --> 06:33.601
Why is there a queen-size mattress
on a king-size bed?

06:33.684 --> 06:35.728
-It's a little small.
-And you know what?

06:35.812 --> 06:37.647
You shouldn't have a queen
in your bedroom.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.023
Right. [laughs]

06:40.149 --> 06:41.901
[Tan] Somebody's ready for action.

06:41.984 --> 06:43.945
Good for you. Protection always.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.321
I love that you're planning ahead.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.658
Oh. Pee-pee pads.

06:48.741 --> 06:49.784
[Tan] Okay, what do we got?

06:49.867 --> 06:52.703
"I hate being sexy,
but I am a bearded, inked-up man,

06:52.787 --> 06:53.621
so I can't help it."

06:55.248 --> 06:58.334
"I like my butt rubbed and my pork--" Ew!

06:59.544 --> 07:00.795
Ooh.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.588
[Antoni] Ryan, what's this?

07:03.423 --> 07:06.259
You have a full-on pantry up here.

07:06.342 --> 07:07.552
Why?

07:07.635 --> 07:11.806
It's easier. If I get hungry at night,
I don't gotta go all the way downstairs.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.183
[Antoni]
You don't need teriyaki sauce up here.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.061
It's a very bachelor-like mentality,
I think.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.564
-We want to keep it sexy for the girls.
-Right.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.732
-They're not gonna think this is sexy.
-No.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.193
[Tan] Okay, let's figure this out.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.320
-I know a lot of this is work wear.
-Right.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.238
Like, club wear.

07:27.321 --> 07:28.531
With work onstage...

07:28.614 --> 07:30.032
-Yeah.
-...it's just, to me it's "funny."

07:30.116 --> 07:31.909
So when they're looking at it
and they're laughing...

07:31.993 --> 07:32.994
-Yeah.
-...not at me.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.204
What are you afraid they're gonna see?
[sighs]

07:35.288 --> 07:36.164
My face.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.542
-You know, everything.
-What's wrong with your face?

07:39.625 --> 07:42.879
You know, the wrinkles, you know,
my beard, all that, you know, just...

07:42.962 --> 07:44.547
I'm not confident with it.

07:44.630 --> 07:45.965
-Can I take your cap off?
-Yes.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.342
You're a handsome man.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.804
I feel like you're hiding away
with all of this stuff,

07:51.888 --> 07:53.222
but my concern is,

07:53.306 --> 07:56.017
if you continue to try and look
so much younger,

07:56.100 --> 07:58.519
there's nothing cool about that.
Like, a DJ should be cool.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.396
Like, Calvin Harris is everything.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.481
-Right.
-Diplo is everything.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.232
They're very much current,
but they're your age.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.650
-They're not far off your age.
-Right.

08:04.734 --> 08:05.860
-Right.
-But they definitely do...

08:05.943 --> 08:07.195
-They don't--
-Not dress like this.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.821
They don't need this. You don't need this.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.073
Honestly, I want to know
who you want to be.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.326
Like a Brad Pitt-type look,

08:13.409 --> 08:14.535
-but looking cool.
-Love.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.037
Know what I mean? Like Justin Timberlake.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.788
-Effortless cool.
-Looking cool. Right.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.541
You know those metal bins that you have...

08:20.625 --> 08:21.459
I have a bin.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.670
No, those metal ones that you can, like,
put clothes in and then burn them.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.838
Do you have one of those?

08:25.922 --> 08:27.715
-Where do you keep those?
-I don't have a metal one.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.425
Okay, great, then I'll find--

08:29.509 --> 08:31.260
I brought my own. Let me go get it.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.684
[gasps] Oh, my gosh.

08:40.144 --> 08:41.771
[unsheathing]

08:42.438 --> 08:45.149
Hi, little girl. Does your daddy need
to grow up a little?

08:45.233 --> 08:48.611
Yeah? Your daddy need to stop putting
your wee-wee pads in the bathroom?

08:48.694 --> 08:50.071
[Karamo] This is, like, anti-aging.

08:50.154 --> 08:52.031
I'm not really an anti-aging person.

08:52.114 --> 08:55.660
I'm like a pro-aging, in a way
that it makes you feel good.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.745
-[Bobby] Gracefully aging.
-Yes.

09:04.293 --> 09:05.419
Where'd everybody go?

09:06.337 --> 09:08.339
[Tan] He loves a crazy sock.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.675
[mock laughter]

09:22.937 --> 09:23.938
[Bobby] Ryan, what happened here?

09:24.021 --> 09:27.066
This is what I would like to be--
been my office.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.736
I do work on that table in my room

09:30.820 --> 09:33.322
because I would like to start
a DJ company.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.824
I legit thought this was a kid's playroom.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.158
You have all the best toys.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.618
[blows whistle]

09:37.743 --> 09:40.037
-[Tan] Oh, I love a penis whistle.
-[Karamo] Oh, cute.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.622
Bachelorette party games.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.667
I've found a lot of things
in people's "home offices" before,

09:44.750 --> 09:46.419
but penis whistles?

09:47.878 --> 09:51.048
I get so busy in the summertime,
it's hard for me to make progress with it.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.883
[Tan] You got two full-time jobs,
practically. That's a lot.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.552
Right. I need a wife.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.889
-No! That is not-- no!
-No!

09:58.973 --> 10:00.683
-No, you don't!
-[Tan] Apologize to your mother.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.935
-Forgive me, Mom, please forgive me.
-Yes, he's very sorry.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.437
You're so much better than that.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.480
[Jonathan] Come on in.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.900
So tell me, you wake up
in the morning and what happens?

10:10.234 --> 10:12.278
This is where I would be,
brush my teeth.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.071
I have, you know, my beard brush,

10:14.155 --> 10:15.156
my beard oil.

10:15.239 --> 10:16.949
-Can I actually see your hair?
-Yeah.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.785
-Do you color your hair, too?
-No.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.829
No, I don't color my hair, just the beard.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.748
-Do you do it yourself?
-Yeah.

10:23.831 --> 10:25.124
-Yes.
-'Cause it is aggressively dark.

10:25.499 --> 10:26.751
-Like, this is opaque.
-Right.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.961
So when it comes to looks,

10:29.045 --> 10:30.921
the tanning and the hair color,

10:31.005 --> 10:32.590
what we've started to do to make us

10:32.673 --> 10:35.468
"look and feel youthful"
actually can start to age us.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.429
It's just good to look at, kind of, like,
the why's.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.973
"Why do I feel this pressure
to color my beard?

10:41.057 --> 10:44.226
Why do I feel pressure
to be so rigid around this,

10:44.310 --> 10:45.394
you know habit of tanning?"

10:45.478 --> 10:46.312
-Right.
-So,

10:46.395 --> 10:47.980
I'm gonna brainstorm more things
for a beard,

10:48.064 --> 10:49.440
'cause I really like you with a beard.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.817
And what we'll do is jump in your shower,
we're gonna take our clothes off.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.612
I'm gonna scrub your back,
you're gonna scrub my back.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.405
And then we'll go get our spray tan.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.698
-That's right. Right.
-So fun.

10:57.782 --> 10:58.908
It really is.

11:00.242 --> 11:03.079
Orange chicken, more chicken patties.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.956
Whoa! So much frozen food.

11:09.293 --> 11:12.797
Okay, so, what do you want in ten years,
with your life?

11:14.006 --> 11:17.593
Ugh. I want the family. I want the kids.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.679
I wanna be playing little league...
[laughs]

11:19.762 --> 11:22.264
...you know, with my kids, obviously,
or coaching them.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.225
In ten years, I don't see myself

11:25.017 --> 11:28.354
being in a club or anything like that,
but I still see myself DJ-ing.

11:28.437 --> 11:31.399
What's the life
that you gravitate towards more?

11:31.482 --> 11:35.403
I gravitate more towards the music
and the club life and the industry

11:35.653 --> 11:37.238
because it's what I love to do.

11:37.697 --> 11:41.117
I guess the problem with that is
it's not a family atmosphere,

11:41.367 --> 11:42.785
and I've always wanted that family.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.496
Do you see a little bit
of a contradiction there?

11:46.455 --> 11:48.082
Yeah, it's hard to think about.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.626
It's a fear...

11:51.544 --> 11:54.630
of losing your dreams, of...

11:54.714 --> 11:57.174
Upsetting my family, you know...

11:58.551 --> 11:59.510
You know,

11:59.593 --> 12:02.346
-it's tough for me to talk about.
-Yeah.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.640
You know, I don't want
to disappoint my family.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.058
Which I understand.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.311
Have you ever asked yourself
if you're letting yourself down?

12:09.687 --> 12:12.648
[sighs] I mean, that's hard.
That's a hard question.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.568
There's only two answers. Yes or no.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.450
[Tan] Where is the secret stuff kept?
Do you know?

12:22.533 --> 12:25.369
Do you wanna show me? Come on.
Show me where all the gross stuff is at.

12:25.911 --> 12:29.749
I counted seven different varieties
of frozen chicken.

12:29.832 --> 12:30.791
I love chicken.

12:30.875 --> 12:34.962
Well, look. You're a jacked guy, so you're
all about, like, lean, clean proteins.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.797
-So, like, I totally get it.
-[knock on door]

12:37.423 --> 12:38.924
-Who's that?
-I have no idea.

12:40.217 --> 12:43.637
-Oh, here-- hey!
-[Susan] Hey.

12:43.721 --> 12:44.680
Come on in.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.016
[laughing]

12:47.141 --> 12:49.059
-[Antoni] How are you?
-[Jeffrey] Good.

12:49.143 --> 12:52.229
Hi. Thank you so much for coming.
Of course you brought food!

12:52.313 --> 12:54.607
-[Susan] Of course!
-[Antoni] It's good to see you.

12:54.690 --> 12:55.983
-Good to see you.
-Brought his favorite cake.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.651
May I take this for you?

12:57.735 --> 12:59.570
-You may, thank you.
-Wait. Does he always get, like,

12:59.653 --> 13:01.071
colorful birthday sprinkles on every cake?

13:01.155 --> 13:03.616
-Yes, he does. That's his confetti.
-Yes, he does.

13:03.699 --> 13:04.825
-Only confetti cake.
-[Antoni] Wow!

13:04.909 --> 13:07.703
[Ryan] And she's got chicken parm
and meatballs. I love it.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.121
[Antoni]
What do you love about it so much?

13:09.205 --> 13:11.332
-It's the sauce that makes it--
-And she makes it.

13:11.415 --> 13:12.249
[Antoni] How do you contribute

13:12.333 --> 13:13.918
-to this ritualistic dinner?
-[Ryan] I don't.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.127
-[Antoni] You don't?
-[Ryan] I show up.

13:15.211 --> 13:18.172
-[Antoni] We're changing it up this week.
-[Susan] Okay.

13:18.255 --> 13:21.926
Your son is hosting dinner here
for everybody.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.636
-What?!
-[laughs]

13:23.719 --> 13:26.013
His arms are crossed,
and he's shaky a little,

13:26.096 --> 13:28.224
but he's gonna do just fine.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.726
-[Susan] Hi!
-[Bobby] Hello!

13:30.810 --> 13:31.811
-[Jonathan] Hey!
-[Susan] Hi, how are you?

13:31.894 --> 13:34.104
It's nice to meet you.
So nice to meet you.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.690
Yum! Yum! Yum! Yum! Yum!

13:36.774 --> 13:38.150
Sir, come upstairs with me.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.860
[Tan] Mom, do you have a favorite?

13:39.944 --> 13:43.322
[Susan] A favorite child?
Listen, I can't say that.

13:43.405 --> 13:46.116
He's been a scoonch
since he was a little kid.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.368
-[Bobby] A what?
-[Tan] What does that mean?

13:47.451 --> 13:48.410
That means, like...

13:48.828 --> 13:53.165
-[Jonathan] Like a little baby kitten?
-Yeah, kind of gets into your heart and--

13:53.249 --> 13:54.917
-[Tan] Aww!
-[laughing]

13:55.334 --> 13:58.087
I was talking to your son
right before you got here.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.172
-Yes.
-What do you think is going on with him?

14:00.256 --> 14:01.966
I think sometimes he feels,

14:02.049 --> 14:05.678
in a way, an outsider
to the rest of the family

14:05.761 --> 14:08.931
-Mm-hmm.
-because of what he does as an MC.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.183
So you think he feels judged
by the family?

14:11.559 --> 14:14.770
Yes. I think he's too overly caring

14:15.563 --> 14:17.940
what even his brothers or we think.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.776
And I think that is really what,

14:21.235 --> 14:23.988
you know, hurts him internally.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.574
I don't think he realizes that

14:26.657 --> 14:28.450
we just want him to be happy.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.244
I might need your help later on this week.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.954
-Are you available?
-I'm available.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.707
-All right. Thank you so much.
-My friend, thank you.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.793
Tell us about the kind of girls he dates.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.712
[laughing]

14:39.795 --> 14:42.798
[Susan]
So I thought they were nice girls, but...

14:42.882 --> 14:46.135
He feels some pressure because his
sister-in-laws are apparently formidable.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.636
-Wonderful girls.
-[Susan] They are.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.472
And so I would love that for him, too,
'cause he wants it.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.809
-We're back! Did you miss us?
-Hi!

14:53.893 --> 14:54.935
-Yes.
-Yeah, always.

14:55.519 --> 14:57.313
[Tan] As long as you're baking,

14:57.396 --> 14:58.898
-we're good.
-[Bobby] None of us have eaten today,

14:58.981 --> 15:00.441
-and then you put a cake in front of us.
-[laughing]

15:00.524 --> 15:02.151
-[Susan] Enjoy.
-Thank you!

15:02.234 --> 15:03.736
-That cake is delicious.
-[Tan] Thank you so much.

15:03.819 --> 15:06.238
-Thanks for nominating him.
-[Bobby] I had such willpower until one--

15:06.322 --> 15:09.116
So let me get this straight.
Your mom comes here,

15:09.450 --> 15:12.661
-gives you a cake and two entrees,
-[laughs]

15:12.745 --> 15:15.247
and we're here to stop that?

15:15.331 --> 15:18.000
-Yeah, right!
-Are we at the wrong house, guys?

15:27.259 --> 15:31.555
Ryan's knowledge of Italian food
is basically limited

15:31.639 --> 15:34.808
to whatever his mother has prepared
for him during his life.

15:35.225 --> 15:38.771
I just want Ryan to try new things
and figure out his own point of view.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.190
Ryan has been stuck in this look
for a long time,

15:41.273 --> 15:44.818
but there's actually several ways we could
approach his beard maintenance,

15:44.902 --> 15:46.987
his skin routine,
his addiction to tanning,

15:47.071 --> 15:50.407
so that he can still be handsome
and totally approachable.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.661
[Tan] He is a wonderful man.

15:53.744 --> 15:57.623
I don't think he's ever taken the time
to reconsider what his look could be.

15:57.706 --> 16:01.919
I want Ryan to be able to walk into a room
with confidence.

16:03.212 --> 16:06.006
I really want to show Ryan that
he can make his entire home inviting

16:06.090 --> 16:08.175
and style it to reflect who he really is

16:08.258 --> 16:10.052
and not the persona
he's putting out there.

16:10.511 --> 16:14.139
Ryan needs to understand he doesn't have
to conform to the life his brothers have.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.809
He can still embrace his passion
for music,

16:16.892 --> 16:19.895
still have a family life
and still go after his dreams.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.036
[Antoni] Come on in.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.372
-Have you ever been here before?
-[Ryan] I have not.

16:38.455 --> 16:41.667
[Antoni] Oh, it's like what Italian food
basically is, but, like, contemporary.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.294
-Chef Adam.
-How's it going?

16:44.378 --> 16:45.379
This is Ryan.

16:45.462 --> 16:46.797
Hello, hello, how are you?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.465
-Adam. Nice meeting you.
-Nice to meet you.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.217
Thanks so much
for letting us take over here.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.011
-Thank you so much.
-We'll try not to make a mess.

16:52.469 --> 16:56.056
Okay, so we're making pesto chicken salad.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.600
-I saw frozen chicken in your freezer.
-Yeah.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.145
I just want you to learn how
to cook it properly,

17:01.228 --> 17:02.563
and we're gonna do it in a pan.

17:02.646 --> 17:03.772
You're gonna make this beautiful,

17:03.856 --> 17:05.816
comprehensive meal
that you're gonna offer your family

17:05.899 --> 17:06.859
at the end of the week.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.194
-Your mom does the red sauce.
-Yes.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.030
-We're not messing with the red sauce.
-No.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.198
What are the other colors
in the Italian flag?

17:13.866 --> 17:14.700
Green.

17:14.783 --> 17:16.702
Green. We're making a green sauce.

17:16.785 --> 17:17.953
-Okay.
-Pesto.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.163
Never tried.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.499
It's this beautiful,
herbaceous green sauce

17:22.583 --> 17:25.210
that's a lot lighter, in my opinion,
than a tomato sauce.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.670
So we're gonna get right into it.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.047
We have garlic cloves.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.215
You can start by just crushing them down.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.718
We want to get it to a nice paste.

17:32.801 --> 17:33.886
These are pine nuts,

17:33.969 --> 17:35.554
and you're just gonna plop all
of those in.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.848
-[Ryan] They're in there.
-And now we're gonna incorporate.

17:37.931 --> 17:40.642
You're gonna make this
for a girl one night.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.436
They'll be like, "Wow, you can cook?"
[laughs]

17:42.519 --> 17:45.105
Yeah. How sexy is that?

17:45.189 --> 17:48.025
-I don't think it gets any sexier.
-A man should be able to cook. Right?

17:50.235 --> 17:53.363
The amount of effort that Ryan puts
into going to the gym,

17:53.447 --> 17:54.531
you know, GTL-ing,

17:54.615 --> 17:59.161
there's no reason why he can't apply
that type of care into food.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.996
This is one of my favorite things
in the world.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.165
-Basil.
-Mm-hmm.

18:03.248 --> 18:06.168
Rip it in, like, large-ish chunks
and then you just put it right in.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.045
It's gonna break down again
while we're working on it.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.714
Awesome, yours is looking great.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.716
So what we're gonna do with these...

18:12.800 --> 18:15.385
we're gonna plop them
into red wine vinegar.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.596
I call it, like, a fake, quick pickle.

18:17.679 --> 18:18.847
It's gonna add a little bite,

18:18.931 --> 18:21.016
and, like, a nice,
bright red color to it as well.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.811
And now, Parmigiano-Reggiano.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.188
Very gently,
move the cheese along the blade.

18:27.147 --> 18:27.981
Great.

18:28.565 --> 18:29.399
There you go.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.112
Oh, you're a perfectionist.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.447
As much as I'm
a disorganized mess sometimes,

18:35.531 --> 18:37.157
there's certain things I just can't stand.

18:37.241 --> 18:40.369
Your house is super neat,
but your room wasn't.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.995
Like, when I come home, I'm tired.

18:42.079 --> 18:42.996
I go right into bed.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.706
Like, I take my clothes off, they drop.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.291
[Antoni]
So you keep it clean for other people,

18:46.375 --> 18:47.543
-not for yourself.
-Yes.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.088
-[Antoni] Ooh, chicken.
-[laughs]

18:51.755 --> 18:53.507
All we're gonna do to is season it.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.467
Just with salt.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.136
A little bit of olive oil.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.180
You can go ahead and put those on the pan.

19:00.556 --> 19:03.183
In, like, all the years
that you've had your house,

19:03.267 --> 19:04.768
have you ever had your parents over,

19:04.852 --> 19:06.854
even for a dinner
where they brought the food or...

19:06.937 --> 19:11.775
No. I've had two family gatherings
at my house in five years,

19:11.859 --> 19:13.193
and they were for the Super Bowl.

19:13.277 --> 19:16.280
Other than that, I haven't ever
had them to my house.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.490
You were saying you want your family
to know you're okay,

19:18.574 --> 19:20.242
that you can take care of yourself?

19:20.325 --> 19:22.035
Like, what an ultimate way of doing that.

19:22.119 --> 19:25.831
For you to even do that every once
in a while sends such a strong message

19:25.914 --> 19:27.291
of the man that you're becoming

19:27.374 --> 19:28.834
and what you're growing. Know what I mean?

19:28.917 --> 19:31.503
It would be nice to be able to invite them
over to my home and say...

19:31.587 --> 19:34.256
-Yeah.
-..."Hey, listen, just come over at six.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.091
Don't bring anything.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.718
-You're fine."
-Except funfetti cake.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.386
Except... [laughing]

19:39.469 --> 19:40.971
[Antoni] Let's calm down.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.724
So you can flip 'em.

19:45.726 --> 19:48.228
Look how beautiful that is.
This isn't hard.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.189
-Not at all.
-Just takes a bit more time.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.193
So this is fresh orecchiette. Pesto.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.654
Go ahead and grab your chicken.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.281
Beautiful.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.949
I'm gonna add some pickled grapes.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.201
Mix that around a little bit.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.288
And then we're gonna lighten it up
with baby arugula.

20:06.371 --> 20:07.456
Toss that around a little.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.083
So make a nice little bowl in there.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.419
-[Ryan] Looks great.
-Doesn't it?

20:12.920 --> 20:14.296
I'm gonna grate a bit of parm.

20:15.505 --> 20:17.758
And I'm a savage,
so I'm gonna add a little bit of oil.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.218
[Ryan] Savage it up, my man.

20:19.301 --> 20:22.179
I'm gonna add a bit of pine nuts on top
for a little added crunch.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.139
Beautiful.

20:27.434 --> 20:28.518
Let's see your creation.

20:28.602 --> 20:31.146
Get the perfect bite.
Get a grape, get chicken.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.606
Let me know how you like it.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.444
Mmm!

20:39.071 --> 20:39.988
This is excellent.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.198
It's nice, right?

20:42.699 --> 20:44.451
You made a meal from scratch,

20:44.534 --> 20:45.953
and you're gonna remember this
when you make it

20:46.036 --> 20:47.204
-for your family.
-A happy food.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.830
You know what's not happy food?

20:48.914 --> 20:52.042
A fried chicken cutlet that's already
breaded that you put on your mini oven.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.168
-But this is.
-[laughs]

21:02.761 --> 21:04.346
-[Tan] After you, my dear.
-Thank you so much.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.973
[Tan] Do you come shopping often?

21:06.056 --> 21:07.516
[Ryan] If it's once a month, that's a lot.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.727
'Cause you don't have enough tank tops,
so I'm glad you're getting more.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.021
I'm glad you're focusing on the things
that you really know

21:13.105 --> 21:14.273
-are important. Great.
-Right.

21:14.356 --> 21:18.485
It may seem shallow, but you putting
the correct clothes on your body

21:18.568 --> 21:20.445
could actually make you more approachable

21:20.529 --> 21:22.239
-to the people you wanna be approached by.
-Right.

21:22.322 --> 21:25.742
I don't think about people looking at you
that way in terms of clothes.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.869
Like, that they're gonna be thinking,

21:27.953 --> 21:29.621
"Oh, that is a guy I wanna talk to."

21:29.705 --> 21:30.789
-Yeah.
-Or,

21:30.872 --> 21:34.543
"No, he looks like a college student,
but he is completely not."

21:34.626 --> 21:36.003
-[laughs]
-Right? Let me tell you.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.088
They want to [bleeps] you,
they don't want to marry you.

21:38.588 --> 21:40.632
And that's wonderful in your 20's.

21:41.341 --> 21:42.551
Come to this mirror.

21:42.801 --> 21:46.513
I hear that you are not comfortable
with your torso.

21:46.596 --> 21:49.016
-You think you're too skinny.
-Yes.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.600
Are you out of your mind?

21:50.684 --> 21:53.645
I've been starving myself for years
to try and get that.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.897
Why work so hard at the gym
if you're not gonna

21:55.981 --> 21:56.857
-see it?
-Show it. Right.

21:57.733 --> 22:00.027
[Tan] You said that your reference points
are the likes

22:00.110 --> 22:01.653
of Brad Pitt and Justin Timberlake.

22:01.737 --> 22:02.612
Easy.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.239
I want to get you in slim-fitted jeans.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.616
You will see that they don't have rips.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.952
I'm fine with a rip or two, no problem.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.121
-Just not crazy amounts of rips. Yeah.
-Not 15?

22:11.204 --> 22:12.873
-Not 15. Doesn't need 15.
-[laughs]

22:12.956 --> 22:16.543
Instead of a sweatshirt,
I want you to consider a sweater.

22:16.626 --> 22:19.629
When I work out, afterwards,
I want to wear something fine-knit

22:19.713 --> 22:21.757
because it really hugs your muscles
in a nice way.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.966
So it's very clear

22:23.050 --> 22:25.927
-that you're working hard.
-Working out. Not hiding everything?

22:26.011 --> 22:29.139
-Yeah. It's such a simple, simple switch.
-I'm excited.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.350
[Tan] I hope you're gonna love
what I've chosen for you.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.559
[laughs]

22:32.642 --> 22:34.102
All right, Ryan, you ready?

22:34.186 --> 22:36.188
-Yes, sir.
-Can you come join me, please, love?

22:36.271 --> 22:39.024
-Give me it all. Give me it all.
-Everybody, put your hands in the air.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.484
Get up, get up!

22:42.027 --> 22:42.903
I love it.

22:42.986 --> 22:43.987
-[Tan] You do?
-I love it.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.405
-[Tan] Legit?
-I love it.

22:45.489 --> 22:47.949
Come through body.

22:48.408 --> 22:50.994
Ryan looks how he should look.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.955
Very much like himself,
just a really sleek version.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.957
Two things first
before we really get going.

22:56.041 --> 22:56.917
Can we take the cap off?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.085
-Please, dear? Thank you.
-Okay.

22:58.168 --> 23:00.796
I would suggest getting rid of the bling
on the ears as well.

23:01.171 --> 23:04.383
Oh, there's a little more sophistication.
Wonderful.

23:04.466 --> 23:05.550
I wanna know what you think.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.594
I feel very comfortable in it,
surprisingly.

23:07.677 --> 23:10.013
-Yeah.
-And I feel like I look good, you know?

23:10.097 --> 23:11.056
You look real good.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.058
You look like a man now.

23:13.141 --> 23:16.228
I don't feel like I'm trying to fit in
as much as I have.

23:16.311 --> 23:18.688
What do you think your mom and dad
and your family would think

23:18.772 --> 23:19.815
if you dressed more like this?

23:19.898 --> 23:21.400
Probably say, "About time."

23:21.817 --> 23:23.527
-Good.
-Kind of want to just walk out right now.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.695
No, we can't go out yet
because I've got one more look.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.241
-Ryan.
-Yes, sir.

23:29.324 --> 23:30.826
Can you get this party started again?

23:30.909 --> 23:32.452
-I can't wait.
-I feel like it's fading.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.163
Hurry up and put your hands
back up in the air.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.458
-Sorry, yes.
-You gotta jump up. There we go. [laughs]

23:38.542 --> 23:41.586
-I don't know if they jump like that.
-Oh, my gosh!

23:41.670 --> 23:43.380
I love it on you.

23:44.047 --> 23:44.965
[Ryan] I do, too.

23:45.048 --> 23:46.591
-This is... wow.
-Good.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.802
We've made it more casual
with a more printed shirt.

23:48.885 --> 23:50.846
-We've made it more casual with a sneaker.
-That's right.

23:50.929 --> 23:53.014
So we've made it a lot more you.

23:53.098 --> 23:56.810
I would never try something like this on,
either, the color or anything.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.397
-I'm just more of a safe person...
-Yeah, I know.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.731
...wear black and gray, but...

24:02.649 --> 24:04.568
I got to step out a little bit more.

24:06.069 --> 24:09.197
This suit is everything.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.616
His self-esteem is going
through the roof right now.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.285
I don't think he's ever gonna go back

24:13.368 --> 24:16.496
to the clothes that he was wearing
now that he's seen himself looking

24:16.580 --> 24:17.664
so well turned out.

24:17.747 --> 24:19.040
All right, go get changed.

24:19.416 --> 24:20.709
-I don't want to. All right.
-[laughs] Go get changed.

24:21.418 --> 24:23.753
-So sexy!
-[laughs]

24:24.421 --> 24:25.630
So sexy.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.216
<i>♪ ...turn it up ♪</i>

24:29.050 --> 24:32.971
<i>♪ Just turn it up, let the beat go on ♪</i>

24:34.222 --> 24:36.224
[Bobby] Whoo, girl,
got some stuff up in here.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.142
[both laugh]

24:40.270 --> 24:42.814
[Ryan] Wow. This place is huge.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.650
All right, before you get overwhelmed,
I have a plan.

24:45.734 --> 24:48.195
-I'm glad someone does.
-[laughing]

24:48.945 --> 24:52.616
Ryan has a beautiful adult home,
but he just lives in his bedroom

24:52.699 --> 24:55.869
as if it were still at a studio
that a bachelor would live in.

24:56.286 --> 24:57.829
So I want to transform
his bedroom and office

24:57.913 --> 24:59.789
to make it into a space
that works for a grownup.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.166
What do you think of this?

25:01.249 --> 25:02.334
[Ryan] It's really neat.

25:02.626 --> 25:05.128
-So you've got this big, beautiful house.
-Right.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.005
And I feel that almost, you've...

25:07.547 --> 25:10.175
You're like, "If I don't have a family,
I'm not gonna use this house."

25:10.258 --> 25:12.844
The thing is, like, you have a family.

25:12.928 --> 25:15.639
-Right.
-You have nieces and nephews

25:15.722 --> 25:18.099
and brothers and sisters
and sister-in-laws and brother-in-laws.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.769
My real friends growing up and all that,
they, you know,

25:20.852 --> 25:22.979
they got their families and kids,
and I always looked at that,

25:23.939 --> 25:25.649
I guess, thinking that's what I wanted.

25:25.732 --> 25:28.068
Comparison can kill you.

25:28.151 --> 25:32.322
We think that other people are judging us
and being harder on us when they're not.

25:32.405 --> 25:35.242
You don't need to do it exactly like
everyone else has done it

25:35.325 --> 25:36.576
-to be fulfilled.
-Right.

25:36.660 --> 25:39.496
-This is a good start, right here.
-[laughs]

25:39.579 --> 25:41.039
All right.
Let's keep looking for some stuff.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.376
I want to get this big,
beautiful house of yours

25:44.459 --> 25:46.002
prepared for your family dinners,

25:46.086 --> 25:47.796
-your nieces and nephews.
-Okay.

25:47.879 --> 25:51.675
I need some other beings in my life
at my house.

25:51.758 --> 25:52.717
Other than Riley.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.011
-Other than Riley.
-Who's a little Riley?

25:55.095 --> 25:57.138
All right. Something like this
is cute for hors d'oeuvres

25:57.222 --> 25:59.015
that you can put out, little snacks,
little nuts,

25:59.099 --> 26:00.767
-little pistachios...
-Okay.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.561
...before you actually got dinner ready.

26:02.644 --> 26:04.896
You needed to tell me that,
because I would not have known.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.606
I would've put grapes or something
in there.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.441
Grapes, you could put grapes in there.

26:08.525 --> 26:11.236
-You could put whatever you want in there.
-Three grapes?

26:11.319 --> 26:12.529
-[laughs]
-Whatever you want.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.614
-Right, right. [laughs]
-It's your house.

26:14.698 --> 26:17.659
Your dishes situation, I noticed.
[scoffs]

26:17.742 --> 26:18.952
A lot of hand-me-downs.

26:19.035 --> 26:21.037
That's embarrassing,
having the family over

26:21.121 --> 26:22.914
and just putting out different dishes

26:22.998 --> 26:24.958
and not having the same silverware.

26:25.041 --> 26:27.544
See, I love, though, that you have
at least enough of a design mind

26:27.627 --> 26:30.297
that you're like, "I'm embarrassed by
the fact that these are all mismatching."

26:30.380 --> 26:31.631
-Right. [laughs]
-I love that.

26:31.715 --> 26:34.384
For dishes, I love an nice, white plate.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.094
It looks crisp. It looks clean.

26:36.177 --> 26:38.179
It makes the food look even better
on the plate.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.264
[Ryan] Makes sense.

26:39.347 --> 26:40.807
[Bobby] You can also mix and match it.

26:40.890 --> 26:43.435
So if you wanted to mix it with a green...

26:43.518 --> 26:44.352
[Ryan] Right, right.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.771
And floral's not really for me.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.898
Doesn't really seem to be your deal,
either.

26:48.982 --> 26:50.233
-[Ryan] No.
-All right.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.360
Let's grab these big pasta bowls
over here,

26:52.444 --> 26:53.820
and then I think we're good.

26:54.070 --> 26:54.904
[Ryan] Awesome.

26:56.489 --> 27:01.786
<i>♪ I've been known to hide ♪</i>

-[Ryan] This is my home away from home.
-[Karamo] Yeah, this is where you're at.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.505
This is where the action happens.

27:12.589 --> 27:13.798
[Ryan] Yeah, in the summertime.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.300
-[Karamo] Kind of nice right now. Yeah.
-Still nice.

27:15.383 --> 27:19.054
So we're going into your old spot
because it was the pinnacle

27:19.137 --> 27:21.181
-of the career you wanted...
-Yeah.

27:21.264 --> 27:22.515
-...that you created...
-Right.

27:22.599 --> 27:24.267
-...and you achieved, let's be clear.
-Right.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.268
You're still doing it.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.187
But I'm gonna be really real with you.

27:27.270 --> 27:29.314
You have two jobs,

27:29.397 --> 27:30.565
a house...

27:30.649 --> 27:32.984
I don't know what type
of fairy tale world you're living in

27:33.068 --> 27:34.778
where you think you wouldn't be able
to get a girl,

27:35.737 --> 27:38.073
but you obviously know
that's just not the truth.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.743
You're in a space now
where you're playing this

27:41.826 --> 27:44.120
broken narrative over and over.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.830
"This is the life you have to have.

27:45.914 --> 27:49.000
Your brothers have it.
You're supposed to have it."

27:49.084 --> 27:49.918
Right.

27:50.001 --> 27:54.422
Why is it so easy for you to recognize,
but not make any changes?

27:55.548 --> 27:57.884
I don't know what to choose,
and I don't know how to change it,

27:57.967 --> 28:00.553
you know,
with trying to juggle everything.

28:00.637 --> 28:04.808
That's what's stopping you from taking
a moment to figure out what do you want.

28:05.308 --> 28:06.142
Right.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.233
-This is Jenkinson's.
-This is the infamous spot.

28:13.316 --> 28:14.234
[Ryan] The infamous spot,

28:14.317 --> 28:17.320
packed Saturday night,
it's packed all throughout the whole club.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.655
Like this, "Yeah!"

28:18.780 --> 28:21.658
-Well, maybe not the fist bump. [laughs]
-"DJ High Def!"

28:21.741 --> 28:24.119
Do guys ever take off their panties
and throw them up there?

28:24.202 --> 28:26.037
-Not guys, no. [laughs]
-Got it.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.248
-If I was here, I might do it.
-I believe you on that.

28:28.331 --> 28:29.791
looking up at that stage and seeing
the DJ and the MC and being, like,

28:29.874 --> 28:33.378
But, you know, when I was 21,
I even remember standing over here

28:33.461 --> 28:37.215
looking up at that stage and seeing
the DJ and the MC and being like,

28:37.799 --> 28:38.800
"Yeah, I could do that."

28:38.925 --> 28:41.386
And then, you know, my dream came true.

28:41.469 --> 28:44.848
When I'm on this stage,
the confidence is there because...

28:45.390 --> 28:47.058
-...I have a microphone in my hand.
-Yeah.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.144
And I feel like
if I put that microphone down,

28:49.227 --> 28:50.228
like, I'm nervous.

28:50.311 --> 28:51.688
I'm just a different person.

28:51.771 --> 28:55.066
Standing up there, man,
looking down at everybody else

28:55.150 --> 28:57.652
and smiling every Friday
and Saturday night,

28:57.736 --> 28:58.903
-no matter what, you know?
-Yeah.

28:58.987 --> 29:02.198
On the weekends, I'm telling you, man,
there's no other place to come to.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.700
[Karamo] For Ryan, working at Jenks

29:03.783 --> 29:07.245
represents him feeling great
and fulfilling all of his dreams.

29:07.328 --> 29:08.580
I've invited your dad here.

29:08.663 --> 29:10.498
You're feeling this sort of judgment

29:10.582 --> 29:13.084
of what they're doing
and what they're saying,

29:13.168 --> 29:15.295
and it's kind of
screwing with who you are.

29:16.337 --> 29:18.631
-[Ryan laughs] You're making me nervous.
-Don't be nervous!

29:19.340 --> 29:23.386
Ryan is always focused on the expectations
he thinks his family has for him.

29:23.470 --> 29:26.848
He's never taken a moment to figure out
what he wants to do with his life next.

29:27.223 --> 29:29.309
All I want for you to do is get to a place

29:29.642 --> 29:31.811
where you can start to be honest
about what you want,

29:32.270 --> 29:35.064
so that you can start making decisions
that are gonna work for you.

29:40.445 --> 29:43.239
I don't say stuff.
We don't talk about stuff like this.

29:43.323 --> 29:46.576
We talk about family stuff
and all good, fun stuff.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.078
It's keeping you in turmoil.

29:50.163 --> 29:54.959
My concern is that you're trying
to measure up to someone,

29:55.418 --> 29:58.213
whether it be me or someone else,

29:58.630 --> 30:00.131
when you don't have to.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.174
It's not just you.

30:01.257 --> 30:05.386
You got the older brother with the wife
and three amazing nephews.

30:05.470 --> 30:09.432
You know, you got my two younger brothers
who go and do missions trips

30:09.516 --> 30:11.392
and go help people across the world.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.479
When you're shooting for that
and your whole family is great,

30:14.562 --> 30:15.480
you know, and you're...

30:16.815 --> 30:18.024
trying to be just as good.

30:18.983 --> 30:19.818
It is hard.

30:21.736 --> 30:25.698
You have to find what makes you happy
and your purpose.

30:28.618 --> 30:32.121
[Ryan] Every weekend,
I make people forget their their troubles.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.958
I make, you know, people create memories

30:35.041 --> 30:37.377
and feel like I have a purpose.

30:41.130 --> 30:42.757
And this is what makes me feel happy.

30:44.634 --> 30:47.929
And feeling like if I choose this...

30:49.931 --> 30:51.307
...it's gonna be the upsetting part.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.685
I feel like I'm letting my family down.

30:54.143 --> 30:57.772
You have to be you,
and we're proud of Ryan.

30:59.315 --> 31:01.317
You're not going to disappoint us.

31:02.443 --> 31:03.736

31:06.322 --> 31:09.367
[Jeffrey]
All Mom and I want is for you to be happy.

31:10.743 --> 31:11.578
[Ryan] Thank you.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.001
-I love you so much.
-I love you, Ryan.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.721

[Jonathan] I want more funfetti cake.
Did you finish it that night?

31:41.858 --> 31:43.484
-[Ryan] No.
-I thought about it several times.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.529
-Oh. After you.
-Here we go. Thank you.

31:46.613 --> 31:47.572
Oh, look at this.

31:47.655 --> 31:49.157
-[Jonathan] Isn't it gorge?
-[Ryan] Yeah.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.825
-Hi, Ken.
-Hey, what's up?

31:50.909 --> 31:51.743
-[Jonathan] How are you?
-Good.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.328
-[Jonathan] Nice to see you.
-Nice to see you, too.

31:53.411 --> 31:54.996
-Ken, Ryan. Ryan, Ken.
-Very nice to meet you.

31:55.079 --> 31:56.497
-You, too.
-[Ryan] Pleasure, thank you.

31:56.581 --> 31:57.624
-All right.
-Get comfortable.

31:58.499 --> 32:02.670
[sighs] Oh, my gosh, yas.
Ken is a very excellent, gorgeous barber.

32:02.754 --> 32:06.215
I wish that it lived, like,
really short on top and, like, forward.

32:06.299 --> 32:10.637
Ryan is definitely stuck in his skincare
and beard care and tanning obsession.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.846
I like it short on the sides.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.515
Yeah, I love a skin tight look.
I love that.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.184
I want to show him
that aging is beautiful,

32:16.267 --> 32:18.603
and that he's beautiful
with or without a tan.

32:18.686 --> 32:21.064
He's beautiful with gray hair.
He's beautiful with black hair.

32:21.147 --> 32:23.816
It's our insides that count.
It's not the outside.

32:24.901 --> 32:27.153
My biggest concern is, like, the tanning.

32:27.236 --> 32:29.322
Like, why are we going
into the tanning bed a lot?

32:29.405 --> 32:32.367
Because when I look at myself sometimes,
I'm too pale.

32:32.450 --> 32:33.952
I feel like I look sick.

32:34.035 --> 32:36.412
Your natural skin is, like, beautiful,
you know,

32:36.496 --> 32:39.791
and actually, you're exposing yourself
to, like, cancer-causing radiation.

32:40.833 --> 32:43.252
You're also saying to yourself
through action that, like,

32:43.336 --> 32:46.297
the way you are inhabiting this world
is not good enough.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.465
Think about when you say that,

32:47.548 --> 32:50.468
that your natural skin,
the way that it is, looks sick.

32:52.095 --> 32:52.929
Yeah.

32:53.471 --> 32:55.932
Yeah, it's weird
to think about it like that,

32:56.015 --> 32:57.100
but, yeah, you're right.

32:57.225 --> 32:59.352
And actually,
it's not the color of your skin

32:59.435 --> 33:01.145
that's making you look "healthy"
or whatever.

33:01.688 --> 33:02.981
You know what I'm saying?

33:03.064 --> 33:05.733
Actually, it's your lifestyle that is,
like, making us feel tired.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.068
Drained, tired.

33:07.151 --> 33:08.945
-It's aging us a little baby bit.
-Right. Yeah.

33:09.445 --> 33:11.239
But, like,
I think that aging is a privilege.

33:11.322 --> 33:14.075
I'm not ashamed of aging. I think it's
something that we could really embrace.

33:14.158 --> 33:18.871
And actually, I think that a DJ or MC
with a striking white beard would be very,

33:19.622 --> 33:21.833
-"Honey, yes."
-[laughs]

33:21.916 --> 33:23.835
[Jonathan] Let's put a cape on him
and get to cutting.

33:23.918 --> 33:25.003

and we're at the shore.

37:08.226 --> 37:11.062
So I wanted to do a nautical theme.

37:11.145 --> 37:13.105
Always wanted a picture behind my bed.

37:13.189 --> 37:16.442
Plus, I can get in the bed so easily.
Like, I could...

37:16.525 --> 37:18.694
[laughing]

37:18.778 --> 37:20.279
[Bobby] Get off that bedding!

37:20.363 --> 37:22.865
Well, but look at how easily
you can get on now.

37:22.949 --> 37:25.576
[laughing]

37:31.749 --> 37:33.334
[Ryan] All of this looks amazing.

37:33.834 --> 37:36.170
[Bobby] A big thing of lavender bath salts
since that's your favorite scent.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.296
I do like lavender.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.507
[Bobby] And it'll keep the bathroom
smelling fresh,

37:39.590 --> 37:40.925
even if there is a wee-wee pad...
[mumbles]

37:41.008 --> 37:42.551
[Ryan laughs] That's right.

37:43.886 --> 37:44.720
[Bobby] And then...

37:45.638 --> 37:48.641
[Ryan]
This is such a good closet. Oh, my God!

37:49.892 --> 37:52.645
-Holy... [bleeps]
-[laughing]

37:52.728 --> 37:55.273
It's good, right? I know. I know.

37:58.359 --> 37:59.944
[Bobby] No more kitchen closet.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.530
Don't look for the teriyaki.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.449
It's not in here? It's not there.

38:07.618 --> 38:10.538
Your new office.
How about you take a seat at your desk?

38:10.871 --> 38:11.747
I'd love to.

38:12.581 --> 38:15.543
-I love this desk.
-[Karamo] So how was this week for you?

38:15.626 --> 38:17.086
This week was phenomenal.

38:18.129 --> 38:21.007
What are the things
that are gonna make you happy?

38:21.090 --> 38:23.301
DJ-ing and MC-ing. [laughs]

38:23.426 --> 38:25.219
You know, even being more successful
with that.

38:25.636 --> 38:28.180
I'm at awesome places right now,

38:28.264 --> 38:30.516
but there's still more.
There's more that I do want.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.560
-So that's next?
-Yeah.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.687
To find the next step
in your music career?

38:34.770 --> 38:35.938
-Yeah.
-I like that.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.899
I want you to tell your family
what you want.

38:38.983 --> 38:42.778
I'm going to, and letting them know
the direction

38:43.446 --> 38:45.364
that Ryan's gonna go.

38:47.533 --> 38:50.494
That's it.
The direction Ryan's gonna go.

38:53.080 --> 38:55.791
Okay, you'll see there are no slogan

38:55.875 --> 38:57.293
-tank tops here.
-No slogan... [laughs]

38:57.376 --> 38:59.587
-I don't miss them. You might.
-No.

38:59.670 --> 39:01.464
We haven't thrown them away.
They're tucked away.

39:01.547 --> 39:04.342
If you feel like you wanna wear it for
a night out every now and then, so be it.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.844
[laughing]
I don't want you to yell at me, though.

39:06.927 --> 39:08.054
I might also yell at you.

39:08.137 --> 39:10.264
-That's fine.
-I am the yeller of the group. I am.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.475
If you don't wear everything
in this closet, doesn't matter.

39:12.558 --> 39:15.394
As long as it inspires you
to change things up

39:15.478 --> 39:17.063
and to be the guy that you want to be.

39:17.146 --> 39:18.439
I guarantee you, I'm going to.

39:19.857 --> 39:21.484
Boys, are you ready?

39:21.567 --> 39:23.277
-Yeah!
-Give me green.

39:23.361 --> 39:27.948
-[Tan] Ryan, come with me, my love.
-[Jonathan] Yes! Yes!

39:28.032 --> 39:30.201
-[Karamo] Damn, baby!
-Oh!

39:30.284 --> 39:32.870
-Oh, my God, you look so good!
-[Tan] Let them see.

39:32.953 --> 39:34.705
[Antoni] Did you ever think
that you would ever wear,

39:34.789 --> 39:36.415
-like, a slightly cropped pant?
-[Ryan] No.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.167
-[Antoni] You look so good.
-[Bobby] Yes.

39:38.250 --> 39:40.628
-[Ryan] I love it, though.
-[Antoni] This is good for a date, too.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.922
-A really good date look. Nice and simple.
-That's what I said.

39:43.005 --> 39:45.216
[Tan] And it just shows you don't have to
go for a wild color.

39:45.299 --> 39:46.634
You've got so much personality.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.469
Your T-shirt doesn't have
to be that for you.

39:48.552 --> 39:49.678
This isn't extreme.

39:49.762 --> 39:51.347
-[Tan] No.
-It's simple.

39:51.430 --> 39:54.183
Okay, so now I want to get you
in something more formal.

39:54.266 --> 39:55.101
Honky-ha!

39:55.184 --> 39:56.143
-[Tan] Ready?
-[Ryan] I'm ready.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.353
-I'm ready.
-[Bobby] Fancy boy.

39:57.436 --> 39:59.021
-[Tan] Come on, dear.
-Honky ha! [laughs]

39:59.105 --> 40:01.107
-Come on out, my love.
-[Antoni] Yes!

40:01.190 --> 40:03.275
-[Karamo] Damn, Daddy!
-I love this suit.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.361
-I want this suit.
-That suit is so damn good on you.

40:05.444 --> 40:07.029
I love that shoe with that suit.

40:07.113 --> 40:08.197
[Tan] Isn't it gorg?

40:08.280 --> 40:09.365
-[Karamo] It's gorgeous.
-[Ryan] Do I look good?

40:09.448 --> 40:10.825
-[Jonathan] Love. Yes!
-[Antoni] You're feeling it.

40:10.908 --> 40:14.662
What I love most about both of these
outfits is the colors that you selected.

40:14.745 --> 40:17.748
He's got a certain kind of brown
in his hair,

40:17.832 --> 40:20.126
and his eyes are this beautiful
browny-green color.

40:20.209 --> 40:23.212
-This feels a lot more appropriately you.
-[Ryan] Yes.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.840
[Bobby] Get on in there.

40:25.923 --> 40:28.843
This experience to me
was more than I expected.

40:30.052 --> 40:33.347
You've changed my life
in such a short period of time.

40:34.223 --> 40:37.560
I feel like it's gonna make me grow
as a person

40:37.643 --> 40:39.478
and with my family.

40:39.562 --> 40:42.106
Tonight, you're having
your family come over.

40:42.523 --> 40:43.899
We're gonna be having a nice dinner,

40:44.692 --> 40:46.444
and we're gonna be talking about

40:46.819 --> 40:49.238
what I need in the future

40:49.321 --> 40:51.949
and what I'm gonna do moving forward.

40:52.032 --> 40:55.161
You're gonna have days when you're gonna
compare yourself to your siblings.

40:55.244 --> 40:57.371
You're gonna  think, like, "How come
I don't have the family that they have?"

40:57.455 --> 40:59.498
But just remind yourself, like,
you have that.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.500
At least now if I am thinking that,
I'll be like,

41:01.584 --> 41:03.794
"You know, these guys are gonna be
mad as hell at me right now

41:03.878 --> 41:05.629
if I keep thinking like this."

41:05.713 --> 41:08.340
-Thank you so, so, so very much.
-[Tan] Of course.

41:08.424 --> 41:10.593
-[Karamo] We're gonna miss you.
-I'm gonna miss you guys.

41:10.676 --> 41:12.178
-[Tan] Bye, my love.
-Thank you.

41:12.261 --> 41:13.888
-Thank you so much.
-[Tan] Have the best night.

41:13.971 --> 41:14.847
I will. Definitely.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.849
Whether you're 17 or 77,

41:16.932 --> 41:19.059
you have to find the courage
to live your life for you.

41:22.688 --> 41:23.564
[grunts]

41:23.647 --> 41:25.816
[Jonathan] It is okay for you
to make your own narrative

41:25.900 --> 41:28.819
of what success and happiness
looks like to you.

41:28.903 --> 41:32.406
If you ever go to a tanning bed again,
think about your... [bleeps] falling off.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.033
[laughing]

41:34.241 --> 41:36.952
Live your own life. Create your own path.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.078
[Ryan] Get home safe.

[Tan] Ant, what are you making?

41:54.637 --> 41:55.554
[Antoni] Pesto.

41:55.638 --> 41:57.389
-I love pesto.
-Are you feeling snacky?

41:57.473 --> 41:59.266
-Hi.
-[Jonathan] Hi.

41:59.350 --> 42:00.476
[Karamo] Hi, Walter.

42:00.559 --> 42:01.936
Yum.

42:02.019 --> 42:05.481
I'm sensing, like, it's time
for us to check in with Ryan.

42:05.564 --> 42:07.566
Let's go watch Ryan!

42:07.650 --> 42:08.859
Come on, Walter.

Bobby, will you hit play for us, please,

42:12.696 --> 42:13.614
-my love?
-Yeah.

42:17.034 --> 42:17.952
All right.

42:18.410 --> 42:19.620
That color's gorgeous on him.

42:19.703 --> 42:20.538
[Karamo] It is.

42:21.121 --> 42:24.792
He's making a chicken pesto salad
with pickled grapes and arugula.

42:27.586 --> 42:28.963
[Susan] Hey.

42:29.046 --> 42:30.965
[Jeffrey] Oh, my goodness.

42:31.048 --> 42:32.633
-Oh!
-[laughs]

42:32.716 --> 42:34.593
Ryan, you look awesome!

42:34.677 --> 42:36.095
Oh, wow!

42:36.178 --> 42:39.431
-I adore his mom and dad.
-[Antoni] Aww!

42:39.515 --> 42:42.184
-Look at what you have on. Whoo-hoo!
-Look at the rug.

42:42.309 --> 42:43.269
[Susan] It fits.

42:43.352 --> 42:44.728
-It fits.
-It fits.

42:44.812 --> 42:47.856
[Antoni] They didn't bring food for once,
'cause he's making food for them.

42:47.940 --> 42:49.191
Cute.

42:49.275 --> 42:51.235
-[Jeffrey] Great, Ryan.
-[Ryan] We can have dinner over here now.

42:51.402 --> 42:52.278
Amen.

42:52.736 --> 42:54.989
-Hello.
-[Ryan] Come on in.

42:55.072 --> 42:57.199
-Holy beard.
-They love a beard in this family.

42:57.908 --> 43:01.996
I'm cooking. I'm cooking.
That's what's happening.

43:02.079 --> 43:03.372
This is beautiful.

43:03.455 --> 43:05.457
Dude! You look amazing.

43:06.292 --> 43:08.544
[Ryan] Give me kisses. Mwah!

43:08.627 --> 43:10.838
Oh, the kids are adorable.

43:11.672 --> 43:12.506
[Ryan] What's up, buddy?

-[Ryan] Give me a kiss.<i> </i>Mwah!

43:15.509 --> 43:16.594
[Cara] Oh, my goodness.

43:17.136 --> 43:17.970
Hello.

43:18.053 --> 43:21.265
I love when brothers are close
to their sister-in-laws.

43:21.348 --> 43:23.183
I think it's so sweet.

43:23.267 --> 43:24.393
Come on up.

43:24.977 --> 43:26.979
-This is my new home.
-Oh!

43:27.980 --> 43:29.398
[Michael] Whoa!

43:29.523 --> 43:31.108
[Ryan] No more futon in the bedroom.

43:31.191 --> 43:32.735
This is so perfect.

43:33.152 --> 43:35.195
That's for the dog to jump up on the bed.

43:35.279 --> 43:37.990
Ryan, I thought that was for you
to get in the bed, but I guess...

43:38.073 --> 43:40.034
-[laughing]
-[Cara] Wow!

43:40.117 --> 43:41.827
[Michael] Looks like I'm gonna have to
borrow some stuff

43:41.910 --> 43:43.454
from Uncle Ry-Ry now.

43:43.537 --> 43:44.455
[laughing]

43:44.538 --> 43:47.249
Listen, it's tailored to me.
It won't even fit you, okay?

43:47.333 --> 43:49.877
-I don't know. I don't know.
-This is amazing!

43:49.960 --> 43:52.254
Now it has to stay like this, right?

43:52.338 --> 43:55.841
Yeah. If not, Tan will beat me up, so...
[laughs]

43:55.924 --> 43:58.177
[Antoni] I think he's gonna appreciate
the organization

43:58.260 --> 43:59.845
-and having everything in its space.
-Yeah.

44:00.554 --> 44:02.222
All right, let's enjoy the food, guys.

44:02.306 --> 44:03.891
-[Cara] Thank you, Ryan.
-[Joseph] Thank you so much.

44:03.974 --> 44:05.267
[Susan] <i>Mangia, mangia!</i>

44:05.351 --> 44:07.019
[Jeffrey] I want more
of this really good food that you made.

44:07.102 --> 44:09.229
-[Susan] Mm-hmm.
-[Jeffrey] The pesto sauce is very good.

44:09.313 --> 44:11.231
[Joseph]
You're gonna have to give us the recipe.

44:11.315 --> 44:12.816
No, I'll just make it.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.402
-Okay.
-Oh, man.

44:15.486 --> 44:18.280
-[laughing]
-[Jeffrey] Oh, wow.

44:19.740 --> 44:23.577
So, this week was very,
very interesting for me.

44:23.994 --> 44:28.457
I got to get to some core of things
that I needed to make myself happy,

44:28.540 --> 44:31.210
you know,
and that was really, really nice to...

44:32.753 --> 44:35.130
...to go through, you know?

44:35.214 --> 44:38.092
I mean, you guys both got
your perfect mate.

44:39.718 --> 44:42.971
And, you know, eventually, I'll find that.

44:43.055 --> 44:43.889
I am happy.

44:44.306 --> 44:48.018
I do need to take a step back
from the family business.

44:48.394 --> 44:49.853
Music is my passion.

44:52.064 --> 44:54.566
-[Fab 5] Aww!
-[Karamo] He's letting so much go.

44:54.650 --> 44:56.568
You know,
I know I could talk to any one of you,

44:56.652 --> 45:00.364
and I feel like that's been
a pretty hard thing for me to do.

45:00.447 --> 45:04.159
You know, we're always here to support
and help in any way we possibly can.

45:04.243 --> 45:08.247
It's incredible how family meals can
facilitate these sorts of conversations.

45:08.747 --> 45:09.707
So powerful.

45:10.207 --> 45:13.711
We're looking forward to seeing Ryan
be a happy Ryan.

45:13.794 --> 45:14.795
Cheers, right?

45:14.878 --> 45:15.796
[all] Cheers.

45:15.879 --> 45:19.425
[Ryan] The most important lesson
that I learned this week was that

45:19.508 --> 45:23.095
there's nothing wrong with being
a 37-year-old MC DJ.

45:23.178 --> 45:28.058
I can still be me and continue
living my life outside of the box,

45:28.142 --> 45:29.059
and that's okay.

45:29.643 --> 45:30.561
That's good.

45:30.936 --> 45:31.979
This is my kid.

45:33.689 --> 45:36.191
-[all] To Ryan.
-Yes!

45:45.284 --> 45:47.369
-[dance music playing]
-Whoo!

45:47.453 --> 45:49.204
I'm DJ Crybaby.

45:49.288 --> 45:51.999
-[hums]
-DJ Crybaby plays a lot of ballads.

45:52.082 --> 45:52.958
Slow vibes.

45:53.041 --> 45:55.169
A lot of emo music,
a lot of Elliott Smith.

45:56.503 --> 45:58.005
Some of the sadder songs by The Beatles.

45:58.464 --> 45:59.757
Not my vibe. Get me out of here.

45:59.840 --> 46:02.301
-My DJ name is DJ Mosh-Mosh.
-Huh!

46:02.384 --> 46:04.470
