But she's the mom.

- So, if you saw a woman
beating her child,

would you say, "She's the mom"
and walk away?

07:06.164 --> 07:07.470

do nothing,

to do something.

Why don't you use
the lactation room?

09:11.942 --> 09:13.727
This is a utility closet.

09:13.770 --> 09:16.686
- No, no. It's more
of a multipurpose room.

09:16.730 --> 09:20.211
I mean, come on, you put some
flowers in here

09:20.255 --> 09:22.953
and some candles,
and it'll be great.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.564
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

I need you to get 12
machine-grade rebars

09:47.195 --> 09:48.762

.

18:26.975 --> 18:29.978
- I probably shouldn't have
told Glenn to kill himself.

18:30.805 --> 18:32.154
- Probably not.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.851
- It's not like I thought this
was gonna be easy.

18:33.895 --> 18:36.376
I just didn't think it was
gonna be this hard.

18:36.419 --> 18:40.815
I'm on day two and I have
nothing left to give.

18:44.427 --> 18:46.864
Aren't you gonna tell me
some inspiring story

18:46.908 --> 18:48.823
about how you made it through
Shakespeare camp

18:48.866 --> 18:50.651
without a dialect coach
or something?

18:50.694 --> 18:52.827
- We were a scrappy,
rag-tag group

18:52.870 --> 18:55.134
but in the end,
we really tamed that shrew.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.440
- There it is/

18:57.484 --> 19:00.704
- Honestly, I don't really
have any advice.

19:00.748 --> 19:03.620
I've never done anything
remotely as hard

19:03.664 --> 19:05.274
as what you're doing.

19:05.318 --> 19:07.668
I'm sorry if that doesn't
make you feel any better.

19:07.711 --> 19:10.149
- Weirdly
it kind of does.

19:10.801 --> 19:13.848
- Hey, Amy, it's
about that time.

19:14.544 --> 19:17.286
- Mm. He's not wrong.

19:17.330 --> 19:20.115
He prays, I pump.
It's a thing.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.161
- It's not a thing.
Whose thing is that?

19:22.204 --> 19:23.858
- Now, if you're looking
for a lighter tea,

19:23.901 --> 19:26.077
you might want to go
the oolong route.

19:26.121 --> 19:28.341
Yup, there--
yup, no, you're on it.

19:28.384 --> 19:29.951
You're on it.
You're on it.

19:29.994 --> 19:31.692
But of course, if you're
looking for something

19:31.735 --> 19:33.041
a little bit more intense,

19:33.084 --> 19:34.956
may I suggest
the Earl Grey?

19:34.999 --> 19:38.438
Nope, upper shelf. Top shelf.
Yup, there it is. Yeah.

19:38.481 --> 19:39.874
Now, actually, you're gonna
want to

19:39.917 --> 19:41.354
get one of the ones
from the back.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.182
The back tea is always
fresher.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.661
That's a little tip for you.

19:44.705 --> 19:46.054
We re-stocked the back.

19:46.097 --> 19:47.795
Now, give that a smell.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.492
You're gonna smell
the bergamot

19:49.536 --> 19:51.233
that's just risen to the top
of the box.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.844
I mean, that is delicious.

19:55.498 --> 19:56.586
- Hey, Glenn.

19:56.630 --> 19:58.675
I just want to apologize.

19:58.719 --> 20:02.201
I'm sorry. I should not have
unloaded on you like that.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.593
That wasn't fair.

20:03.637 --> 20:06.770
- I can't believe that I
ever thought a bath bomb

20:06.814 --> 20:08.424
would solve all
your problems.

20:08.468 --> 20:11.210
- I mean, a bath bomb.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.690
I was so far off.
- Yeah.

20:13.734 --> 20:16.824
You were.
- So I got you a puppy.

20:16.867 --> 20:19.174
Wh-how--

20:19.218 --> 20:20.480
Glenn, I--

20:20.523 --> 20:21.698
- Aww.
- Can't--

20:21.742 --> 20:25.049
I know.
There are no words.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.703
- Thank you.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.705
You're welcome.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.100
- That's exactly
what I need.

20:32.143 --> 20:34.407
- I know.

20:37.410 --> 20:40.282
Bye, whatever your name's
gonna be.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.544
- Oh, look at that.

20:41.588 --> 20:42.719
Putting the products
back on the shelf

20:42.763 --> 20:44.068
without punching
or kicking them.

20:44.112 --> 20:45.896
You're way ahead
of the other seasonals.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.116
- Thank you, thank you.
My parents will be so proud.

20:49.596 --> 20:51.641
- You guys mind if I
take five? Just gotta pee.

20:51.685 --> 20:53.513
- Oh, yeah, go for it.
- See you soon, man.

20:53.556 --> 20:54.818
- Thanks.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.298
- I like him.
- I really like him.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.257
It just goes to show

20:58.300 --> 21:00.520
you put in the work,
you kiss a bunch of frogs,

21:00.563 --> 21:03.087
eventually you're gonna
find your prince.

21:03.131 --> 21:04.872
Lonnie is our prince.

21:04.915 --> 21:07.091
I was
gonna go needle in a haystack,

21:07.135 --> 21:08.310
but I'm in such a good mood,

21:08.354 --> 21:10.791
I'll go along
with your metaphor.

21:14.447 --> 21:16.579
Lonnie's urinating
on the floor.

21:16.623 --> 21:19.278
- Yeah, that is
what's happening.

21:19.321 --> 21:22.890
All right.
