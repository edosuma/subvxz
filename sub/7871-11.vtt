"In this exciting strategy game,

00:31.559 --> 00:34.862
"you amass resources--
timber, salt fish and wax--

00:34.896 --> 00:37.030
"to fund the syndicate
to gain influence

00:37.065 --> 00:38.866
with the Doges of Venice."

00:38.900 --> 00:40.434
Doges?
Why do we have to play

00:40.468 --> 00:42.169
this stupid game Lisa likes?

00:42.203 --> 00:43.470
I don't like this game.

00:43.505 --> 00:44.838
Nobody likes this game.

00:44.873 --> 00:47.274
Even the kids on the box
look bored.

00:47.308 --> 00:48.675
They're miserable.

00:48.710 --> 00:52.012
We have to do something
until the storm passes.

00:52.046 --> 00:54.314
Now, just fill out
these customs forms,

00:54.349 --> 00:55.649
and we can get started.

00:55.683 --> 00:57.017
Twister!

00:57.051 --> 01:00.254
No! Whenever we play that,
my elbow touches Dad's junk.

01:00.288 --> 01:02.589
No! Outside the house!

You live like this?

01:19.858 --> 01:21.592
Ooh, dear Lord,

01:21.626 --> 01:23.227
if thy tornado must take me,

01:23.261 --> 01:24.995
please let it take me to Oz.

01:25.029 --> 01:28.765
But don't let Flanders
be the scarecrow.

01:28.799 --> 01:30.417
We made it, boy.

01:31.853 --> 01:33.537
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:33.571 --> 01:36.940
This counts as a walk!

01:38.109 --> 01:39.549
The tornado took
old what's-his-name.

01:39.577 --> 01:40.827
I'm going after him.

01:40.862 --> 01:42.829
No, Homie, it's
too dangerous.

01:44.232 --> 01:47.551
Hey, Homer, we were just
doing a little storm chasing.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.586
Lenny, take us with
you to find our dog.

01:49.621 --> 01:51.255
It's okay, Marge,
they're professionals.

01:51.289 --> 01:52.923
What? 'Cause they
rented a van

01:52.957 --> 01:54.791
and taped an antenna
to the top?

01:54.826 --> 01:56.510
Not just any tape.

01:56.544 --> 01:57.644
Duct tape.

01:57.679 --> 01:59.246
Oh, all right.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.547
But I'm coming with you

02:00.582 --> 02:02.282
to make sure no one
does anything stupid.

02:02.317 --> 02:04.551
Don't worry, Marge,
we bought a ton of safety gear

02:04.602 --> 02:06.904
from a highly-respected
storm chaser's widow.

02:06.938 --> 02:09.639
It's not what
you're thinking.

02:09.674 --> 02:11.241
He died of a heart attack.

02:11.276 --> 02:13.477
Yeah, 80 feet
up in the air.

02:13.511 --> 02:17.080
Behold, the awesome
nonsense of nature.

02:22.954 --> 02:24.821
Okay, the tornado
that took your dog

02:24.855 --> 02:27.624
looked like an F3
moving westerly.

02:27.659 --> 02:29.576
I guess you do know
your weather.

02:29.627 --> 02:30.994
Ha! That means a lot

02:31.028 --> 02:32.963
coming from such an
attractive woman as you.

02:32.997 --> 02:35.121
I'd say she's prettier
than a surface hoar.

02:35.146 --> 02:36.083
Hey!

02:36.084 --> 02:37.267
Surely, you didn't
misunderstand

02:37.302 --> 02:38.418
my usage of
"surface hoar."

02:38.469 --> 02:39.786
The sublimation
of ice crystals

02:39.821 --> 02:41.905
that's colder
than a frost point.

02:41.940 --> 02:43.440
Maybe.

02:43.474 --> 02:45.642
Look, you guys
obviously know about weather,

02:45.677 --> 02:48.679
but I understand something
much more predictable:

02:48.713 --> 02:50.280
women.

02:50.315 --> 02:53.517
What women really want
is a guy who's confident enough

02:53.551 --> 02:55.752
to go completely downhill
after marriage

02:55.787 --> 02:58.121
and know
she'll still love him.

02:58.156 --> 02:59.673
I'll tell you what
women really want:

02:59.707 --> 03:01.825
a man who can hold a
note the longest.

03:01.859 --> 03:03.093
That is the stupidest...

03:03.127 --> 03:04.328
One, two, three, go.

03:15.790 --> 03:17.891
Homer, you do not
have to compete

03:17.925 --> 03:19.426
with your friends for me.

03:19.460 --> 03:20.961
I would never do that.

03:22.630 --> 03:24.865
Enough with the singing.

03:24.899 --> 03:27.584
Fine, but I swear, I will
win you back from Lenny.

03:27.618 --> 03:28.885
'Nado!

03:29.887 --> 03:31.138
Ooh.

03:31.189 --> 03:33.724
It's like God's vacuum cleaner.

03:48.506 --> 03:49.906
We're cutting it
kind of close.

03:49.941 --> 03:52.109
Not to worry-- we're
safe in the van.

03:57.532 --> 03:59.349
Anyone want their
seat warmer?

03:59.384 --> 04:00.884
It's gone.

04:11.429 --> 04:13.163
Help me, God.

04:13.197 --> 04:15.665
What is it I'm paying you for
every Sunday?

04:22.306 --> 04:24.057
Can... always use...

04:24.092 --> 04:26.193
a good babysitter.

04:27.445 --> 04:29.913
I was just 27 years
from retirement!

04:29.947 --> 04:32.482
Oh, my God,
the twister got Carl,

04:32.500 --> 04:34.534
my best friend in the world.

04:34.569 --> 04:37.170
I can barely remember
what he looks like.

04:37.205 --> 04:38.572
He was a black guy,

04:38.606 --> 04:40.674
but his voice sounded
like a white guy.

04:40.708 --> 04:42.692
Hey, excuse me for
wanting to fit in.

04:42.727 --> 04:44.895
And here comes
Santa Little Helper.

04:49.834 --> 04:52.269
Homie, we made it.

04:53.621 --> 04:54.905
Oh, my God.

04:54.939 --> 04:56.139
Ha ha!

04:56.173 --> 04:57.758
You're trapped
in there good.

04:57.792 --> 04:59.109
Once again,
the big banks

04:59.143 --> 05:00.410
stick it
to the little guy.

05:02.263 --> 05:03.897
Come on.

05:03.931 --> 05:05.198
Are you pushing?

05:05.233 --> 05:06.700
Yes, it won't give.

05:08.603 --> 05:11.037
I don't know if we're going
to be able to get out.

05:12.607 --> 05:14.141
What are you writing?

05:14.175 --> 05:16.409
Maybe the last words
I'll ever write.

05:16.444 --> 05:18.578
Oh.

05:18.613 --> 05:20.213
Lenny, you
calling for help?

05:20.248 --> 05:22.816
Let them have their moment.

05:24.049 --> 05:26.850
Kent Brockman here
at death's revolving door.

05:27.020 --> 05:28.229
Police have arrived on the scene

05:28.230 --> 05:30.998
after having fled the state
at the first sign of the storm.

05:33.235 --> 05:35.369
Bulletproof,
as I somewhat suspected.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.704
But don't you worry,

05:36.738 --> 05:39.206
we're having
a very expensive crane

05:39.241 --> 05:41.809
brought in
from Shelbyville.

05:41.843 --> 05:43.210
What is this, a bird?

05:43.245 --> 05:44.979
It's a bird
known as a crane.

05:45.013 --> 05:47.648
And it got very sick
on the way over.

05:47.682 --> 05:49.216
Well, our
top priority

05:49.251 --> 05:51.085
is making sure that
bird gets well.

05:51.119 --> 05:53.787
Hey! Hello!

05:53.822 --> 05:55.573
As for you,
your only hope

05:55.607 --> 05:57.591
is this glass cutting guy
from the hardware store.

05:57.626 --> 06:00.060
You guys want to come out
in a plain circle

06:00.095 --> 06:01.595
or a kind of
a rosette shape?

06:01.630 --> 06:03.731
Just cut the glass.

06:03.765 --> 06:06.767
Everybody wants it done
yesterday.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.454
Uh, now we're
ordering some lunch.

06:10.488 --> 06:12.323
Uh, want to go
halfsies on a pizza?

06:12.357 --> 06:14.458
FYI, that means
you get one slice.

06:14.492 --> 06:16.193
Okay, wise guy,
you get to pull out

06:16.228 --> 06:18.178
the two corpses
when we're done.

06:19.581 --> 06:21.916
Except for the face
full of glass

06:21.950 --> 06:23.751
when the door
finally collapsed,

06:23.785 --> 06:25.786
he did a pretty good job.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.588
Found another one.

06:28.890 --> 06:30.708
It was so scary
thinking something

06:30.742 --> 06:32.343
might happen to you guys.

06:34.696 --> 06:37.298
Mom, I am so glad
you're alive.

06:37.332 --> 06:39.033
Were you worried
about me, boy?

06:39.067 --> 06:40.334
Sure. Why not?

06:42.170 --> 06:44.822
Clearly,
the boy's in shock.

06:44.856 --> 06:46.640
Oh, yeah, I'm a wreck.

06:46.675 --> 06:48.525
Stop being blasé.
Never!

06:48.560 --> 06:51.161
Now, I know you kids
are scared by what happened,

06:51.196 --> 06:52.997
but it's bedtime.

06:53.031 --> 06:55.633
Just go into your dark rooms
and shut your eyes.

06:57.152 --> 06:59.687
Homie, if we
did both die,

06:59.721 --> 07:01.872
we've never
named guardians.

07:01.906 --> 07:03.991
The kids could end up
wards of the state.

07:04.025 --> 07:04.992
Connecticut?

07:05.026 --> 07:07.161
No, our state.

07:07.195 --> 07:08.996
Okay, you're right.

07:09.030 --> 07:10.497
It's hard to imagine

07:10.532 --> 07:11.999
anyone else
bringing up our kids,

07:12.033 --> 07:13.901
but I think the choice
is obvious:

07:13.935 --> 07:15.970
my dad.

07:16.004 --> 07:18.339
Oh, you'd let me
have another chance

07:18.373 --> 07:21.408
after the way I screwed
things up with you?

07:21.443 --> 07:22.843
Eh, good point.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.078
We'll find somebody else.

07:24.112 --> 07:26.880
Yep, you're a big bag of blubber

07:26.915 --> 07:28.599
soaked in worthless juice.

07:28.633 --> 07:30.567
I got it, Dad.

07:30.602 --> 07:33.270
Why I married you
I'll never know.

07:33.305 --> 07:34.421
Oh, yeah?

07:34.456 --> 07:36.523
The tornado was more of a father
to me than you.

07:36.558 --> 07:38.926
Okay, how about my brother?
He's rich.

07:42.263 --> 07:43.864
Hi. You've reach Herb Powell.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.165
I'm poor again.

07:46.568 --> 07:48.602
There's really
only one choice,

07:48.636 --> 07:51.772
or should I say
two identical choices?

07:51.806 --> 07:53.507
Sugar?

07:53.541 --> 07:55.576
Oh, how very
kind of you.

07:55.610 --> 07:56.910
I'm not giving our kids

07:56.945 --> 07:58.679
to these gravelly-voiced
super hags.

07:58.713 --> 08:00.014
One lump, please.

08:00.048 --> 08:01.615
Homer, my sister's
adopted Ling,

08:01.649 --> 08:03.217
and she's doing great.

08:03.251 --> 08:05.302
We've been
tiger-mothering her.

08:05.337 --> 08:06.904
Ling, music time.

08:06.938 --> 08:09.173
♪

08:09.207 --> 08:10.641
Ling, floor routine.

08:13.645 --> 08:15.929
More syncopating.
Stick the landing!

08:15.964 --> 08:17.931
And no resenting us ever.

08:17.966 --> 08:19.967
That's some impressive
flute-nastics.

08:20.001 --> 08:22.269
Shut up!
You can't praise her.

08:22.303 --> 08:24.171
She'll think she's
smart and slack off.

08:24.205 --> 08:26.640
Then all our loving
would be for nothing.

08:28.710 --> 08:30.761
Mmm, maybe we'd better go.

08:30.795 --> 08:32.996
Didn't you want to
ask us something?

08:33.030 --> 08:34.498
Good-bye forever.

08:34.532 --> 08:35.832
Help me.

08:35.866 --> 08:38.952
I think it's time
to go off family.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.989
Luanne and I have gone
through some rough patches,

08:42.023 --> 08:45.542
so to be seen as stable enough
to raise your kids, well,

08:45.577 --> 08:47.344
it would be an honor.

08:47.379 --> 08:49.446
You know what else
would be an honor?

08:49.481 --> 08:52.015
Having a husband
who asks my opinion

08:52.050 --> 08:55.219
before inviting in
three more mouths he can't feed.

08:55.253 --> 08:56.820
Hey, Luanne, you
always asked me

08:56.855 --> 08:58.856
what I saw in Vicky
at the Walgreens.

08:58.890 --> 09:01.625
Well, I'll tell you
what I saw: not you!

09:01.659 --> 09:04.845
You told me you didn't
even know her name.

09:04.879 --> 09:06.230
Well, that's
her name, okay?

09:06.264 --> 09:07.625
Let me get this straight.

09:07.632 --> 09:09.433
We have 17 kids,
and you want us

09:09.467 --> 09:10.667
to take three more?

09:10.702 --> 09:12.469
Anything new that wanders
into this house

09:12.504 --> 09:14.705
winds up in the stew pot.

09:16.274 --> 09:19.276
Hey, I'm so sorry, but
we just adopted a baby.

09:19.310 --> 09:20.494
Give me back my pants.

09:20.528 --> 09:22.129
I've got to get
back to my unit.

09:22.163 --> 09:24.131
Someone's cranky.

09:24.165 --> 09:25.749
All right, Marge,
maybe we're

09:25.784 --> 09:28.152
being a little too choosy
about who our kids

09:28.186 --> 09:29.787
spend the rest of
their lives with.

09:29.821 --> 09:31.288
We'll take what
we can get.

09:35.210 --> 09:36.527
Uh-oh.

09:36.561 --> 09:38.061
I wonder if word
has gotten out

09:38.096 --> 09:40.247
that we're looking
for guardians.

09:48.807 --> 09:50.791
Ah!

09:50.825 --> 09:52.259
Go! Go!

10:27.212 --> 10:29.813
All right, the coast is clear.

10:33.284 --> 10:36.520
Wait a minute,
I live here. Aw.

10:43.588 --> 10:44.888
Where are we going?

10:44.922 --> 10:46.357
And why are we wearing
our good clothes?

10:46.391 --> 10:47.858
With name tags on them.

10:49.577 --> 10:51.245
Kids, there's nothing
to worry about.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.234
But we're looking
at replacements

10:57.268 --> 10:59.603
for your mom and me
if we should fail

10:59.637 --> 11:01.205
to die together as a family.

11:01.239 --> 11:03.073
Oh, I see. You guys
are trying to find

11:03.107 --> 11:04.491
a couple of
saps to take us

11:04.542 --> 11:06.577
when Dad has a coronary
in the dead of night,

11:06.611 --> 11:07.895
rolls over and
crushes Mom.

11:07.929 --> 11:09.329
This is not that,

11:09.381 --> 11:10.964
and that
smart-alecky attitude

11:10.999 --> 11:13.050
is exactly why
no one wants you.

11:13.084 --> 11:15.919
Homer, dual incomes,
no kids at 2:00.

11:15.954 --> 11:17.755
Ooh.

11:18.940 --> 11:20.758
Okay, I'll nudge them
with the car.

11:20.792 --> 11:23.394
We'll get a whole
"meet cute" thing going.

11:25.780 --> 11:27.297
Aah! What the hell
are you doing?

11:27.332 --> 11:28.966
Keith, relax.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.552
Look at those
adorable children.

11:31.586 --> 11:34.421
Hmm, I think I hear
a slight accent.

11:34.456 --> 11:35.823
Mid-Atlantic.

11:35.857 --> 11:37.591
That's where they
filmed <i>The Wire!</i>

11:37.625 --> 11:38.876
Step on it!

11:40.978 --> 11:43.297
This is a pretty
important decision.

11:43.331 --> 11:44.882
How about asking
that Japanese guy

11:44.916 --> 11:46.817
who set the world record
for eating hot dogs?

11:46.851 --> 11:48.786
He's like a successful
version of Dad.

11:50.155 --> 11:52.072
Maybe we should
just give up for now,

11:52.107 --> 11:54.975
have some fried clams
and collect sea glass.

11:55.009 --> 11:57.294
Wait, what about
that couple?

11:57.328 --> 11:59.113
They look pretty cozy.

11:59.147 --> 12:01.398
That's Moe
and a bag of garbage.

12:01.433 --> 12:03.634
Boy, cats sure breed a lot.

12:05.370 --> 12:06.904
Why would you do that to me

12:06.938 --> 12:08.722
after I thought
about feeding you?

12:08.773 --> 12:11.158
Mmm.

12:17.882 --> 12:19.967
Whoa, look at that guy.

12:31.746 --> 12:33.997
Yo, I'm Mav.

12:34.032 --> 12:36.707
Wow, a man's stomach
can be flat?

12:36.741 --> 12:38.742
It's one of the, like,
awesome side effects

12:38.777 --> 12:40.344
of being a pro surfer.

12:40.378 --> 12:41.545
Wow.

12:41.580 --> 12:43.998
Someone's smitten.

12:44.032 --> 12:46.066
Whoa, way to shralp
the crispies, babe.

12:46.101 --> 12:47.501
My wife, Portia.

12:47.535 --> 12:48.769
Another surfer?

12:48.803 --> 12:50.337
Environmental lawyer.

12:52.474 --> 12:54.441
And in my free time,
I prosecute record companies

12:54.476 --> 12:56.744
who withhold royalties
from elderly blues musicians.

13:03.935 --> 13:06.470
Um, why don't we
discuss it over dinner?

13:06.504 --> 13:07.538
Discuss what?

13:07.572 --> 13:08.772
Things that
you're desperately missing

13:08.807 --> 13:10.908
from your life
that you never knew you needed.

13:10.942 --> 13:12.476
Cool. See you at 6:00.

13:14.412 --> 13:17.648
So, surfing is
really your job?

13:17.682 --> 13:20.184
Yeah, I earned a couple million
on the tour last year.

13:20.218 --> 13:22.102
Just for standing
on a thing?

13:22.137 --> 13:23.170
Mmm.

13:23.204 --> 13:25.940
Wow.

13:25.974 --> 13:27.925
Your house is perfect.

13:27.959 --> 13:29.159
No sharp corners,

13:29.194 --> 13:32.162
no unsafe balconies,
a cool grandpa.

13:32.197 --> 13:33.530
I love two things:

13:33.565 --> 13:35.366
shutting up
and giving away money.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.669
Ooh, thanks, Dad.

13:38.703 --> 13:40.521
What's that stone
around your neck?

13:40.555 --> 13:41.855
It's a promise stone.

13:41.890 --> 13:44.174
It signifies that
if I ever get to be a burden,

13:44.209 --> 13:45.492
I just jump in a volcano.

13:45.527 --> 13:46.894
Wow.

13:46.928 --> 13:50.331
I assumed the Jackson Five
were the only perfect family,

13:50.365 --> 13:52.700
but now I see there's another.

13:52.734 --> 13:55.869
Princeton, B.A.,
Oxford, M.A.

13:55.904 --> 13:57.171
I smell a Rhodes.

13:57.205 --> 13:58.539
No, I turned it down

13:58.573 --> 14:00.541
because Cecil Rhodes
was such a racist.

14:02.243 --> 14:03.978
Uh, say,
listen, Portia.

14:04.012 --> 14:06.780
How would you and Mav
feel about...

14:06.815 --> 14:08.916
um, swinging?

14:08.950 --> 14:10.384
Uh, with you guys?

14:10.418 --> 14:11.919
Uh, seems like
my husband

14:11.953 --> 14:13.854
would be getting the
much better deal.

14:13.888 --> 14:15.055
No, no, no.

14:15.090 --> 14:17.291
I-I meant pushing
kids on swings.

14:17.325 --> 14:19.493
Give me a minute to get
some images out of my mind.

14:19.527 --> 14:21.528
Okay, take whatever
time you need.

14:21.563 --> 14:25.232
I just want to know if you'd
like to be their guardians.

14:25.266 --> 14:26.450
Wow.

14:26.468 --> 14:28.118
Wow, that's quite an offer.

14:28.153 --> 14:29.987
This is so fast.

14:30.021 --> 14:33.307
It's so hard to get to know a
child after just one day. I...

14:33.341 --> 14:36.010
All you need to know
is I'm a politeness monster

14:36.044 --> 14:38.312
who eats please
and farts thank-yous, ma'am.

14:38.346 --> 14:42.149
I'm exactly the kind of kid
he's pretending to be.

14:45.637 --> 14:46.937
Hmm.

14:46.971 --> 14:48.138
Babe, when
a killer wave hits,

14:48.173 --> 14:49.406
you can't spend
your whole life

14:49.441 --> 14:51.308
deciding if you want
to drop in or not.

14:51.343 --> 14:54.078
It just might be the most
righteous tube we ever shot.

14:54.112 --> 14:57.214
Man, you sure can talk
surfer talk.

14:57.248 --> 14:59.750
Okay, we'll give some serious
thought to taking them.

14:59.784 --> 15:02.753
Maybe this will help you
make up your mind.

15:03.788 --> 15:05.322
It's empty.

15:05.357 --> 15:09.259
You never know when you
might want to mail something.

15:10.028 --> 15:11.995
Homie,

15:12.030 --> 15:14.865
it's been a wonderful day,

15:14.899 --> 15:16.367
but do you think
maybe we're moving

15:16.401 --> 15:18.302
a little too quickly?

15:18.336 --> 15:20.037
Worrywart Marge.

15:20.071 --> 15:22.673
You don't look a Trojan horse
in the mouth.

15:25.527 --> 15:27.745
But we know
so little about them.

15:27.779 --> 15:29.313
I swear to you, Marge,

15:29.347 --> 15:32.416
when I have the time,
I will Google them both.

15:36.287 --> 15:37.755
It's all good, brah.

15:37.789 --> 15:39.757
Hey, where's Bart?

15:39.791 --> 15:42.259
Oh, uh, well,
he wanted to be here,

15:42.293 --> 15:44.428
but I'm going to decrease
the volume of my voice

15:44.462 --> 15:46.764
and mumble so you can't really
understand what I'm saying,

15:46.798 --> 15:48.678
and I'll just keep doing it
until the subject...

15:48.700 --> 15:50.751
Your father says I need
to keep you lashed

15:50.802 --> 15:53.353
to the mast for five more arrrs.

15:53.388 --> 15:56.874
Is that arrrs or hours?
Both.

15:56.908 --> 15:58.242
Great.

15:58.276 --> 15:59.827
And now my Dad
can notarize.

15:59.861 --> 16:02.529
I still have my uses.

16:02.564 --> 16:04.164
Mm-hmm.

16:04.199 --> 16:05.165
Name another.

16:06.668 --> 16:08.802
Well, I must admit

16:08.837 --> 16:11.205
it's a relief to get that
taken care of.

16:11.239 --> 16:14.608
Now I can finally complete
my bucket list.

16:16.244 --> 16:18.545
Homer, Marge,

16:18.580 --> 16:20.047
we have a favor to ask.

16:20.081 --> 16:21.815
Too late!
You already signed!

16:21.850 --> 16:24.518
Oh, wait, there's one more.

16:26.221 --> 16:28.188
Suckers!

16:28.223 --> 16:30.240
Oh, wait, you've got
to initial this.

16:31.676 --> 16:33.377
Checkmate.

16:33.411 --> 16:34.845
Listen, Homer,

16:34.879 --> 16:37.047
we just wanted to know
if we could borrow the kids

16:37.081 --> 16:38.382
for a weekend at our ski house.

16:38.416 --> 16:40.217
We thought they could
pick out their bedrooms.

16:40.218 --> 16:41.751
A whole weekend?

16:41.769 --> 16:43.086
I don't know.

16:43.121 --> 16:45.556
Hey, if they can watch them
for the rest of their lives,

16:45.590 --> 16:47.591
they can certainly do it
for a weekend.

16:47.625 --> 16:48.892
I guess.

16:48.927 --> 16:50.928
As long as we don't
make it a habit.

16:50.962 --> 16:55.098
Marge, no indulgence of mine
ever becomes a habit.

17:00.205 --> 17:02.739
Do you have to do that
in front of people?

17:02.774 --> 17:04.340
It helps me write.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.009
♪ Just the two of us

17:06.044 --> 17:09.713
♪ We can make it if we try

17:09.747 --> 17:11.565
♪ Just the two of us

17:11.598 --> 17:14.401
♪ <i>Just the two of us</i> ♪

17:14.435 --> 17:16.987
Marge, this has been
great couples time.

17:17.021 --> 17:21.157
The one thing people with kids
desperately need is no kids.

17:21.192 --> 17:22.559
Well, at least we have time

17:22.594 --> 17:24.595
to get the pets'
Christmas presents.

17:24.628 --> 17:27.064
I don't like the way
they just rip the paper off.

17:27.098 --> 17:29.333
Santa's Little Helper,
my ass.

17:30.935 --> 17:32.069
Hmm?

17:36.774 --> 17:38.342
My God.

17:38.376 --> 17:40.244
They want to
steal our kids.

17:40.278 --> 17:42.813
No one steals my kids,

17:42.847 --> 17:45.048
except me,
from that theme park jail

17:45.083 --> 17:47.518
that I never told you about,
except I guess I just did.

17:47.552 --> 17:48.986
We're all caught up now.
Let's go.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.843
<i>It all makes sense now.</i>

17:53.844 --> 17:56.162
That's why they took
our kids so quick.

17:56.196 --> 17:58.147
Like all childless couples,

17:58.181 --> 18:00.399
they troll the beaches waiting
for the egg-layers

18:00.450 --> 18:02.518
to wander off from their young.

18:02.553 --> 18:03.903
She's gonna raise three kids

18:03.937 --> 18:05.988
without wrecking
that perfect figure.

18:06.023 --> 18:07.223
Oh, yeah, man.

18:08.525 --> 18:09.709
Don't worry, Marge.

18:09.743 --> 18:11.026
We'll get them.

18:11.044 --> 18:12.962
Unless we die
on this icy mountain road.

18:12.996 --> 18:15.047
Then they've won forever.

18:15.082 --> 18:17.550
Homie, I just had
a horrible thought.

18:18.802 --> 18:20.869
Women and their
horrible thoughts.

18:20.888 --> 18:23.723
What if they are better
for the kids than us?

18:23.757 --> 18:25.858
Marge, let me set your mind
straight about something.

18:25.893 --> 18:27.710
That spectacular
young couple

18:27.728 --> 18:30.062
is definitely better
for the kids,

18:30.097 --> 18:32.098
but those kids are ours,

18:32.149 --> 18:34.100
because we made them

18:34.151 --> 18:35.518
by accident.

18:35.552 --> 18:37.069
And now we're gonna
take them back

18:37.104 --> 18:38.721
because we love them,

18:38.739 --> 18:41.190
especially now that we've had
a little time apart from them.

18:43.377 --> 18:45.912
I've got a bone
to pick with you.

18:45.946 --> 18:48.581
Then an apology to make.

18:48.615 --> 18:50.883
Then we exchange
insurance information.

18:50.918 --> 18:53.619
Then more bone picking.

18:54.638 --> 18:57.089
Homer, Marge,
I understand your anger,

18:57.124 --> 18:59.241
but your kids
are more awesome

18:59.259 --> 19:01.427
than the breaks
at Waimea.

19:01.461 --> 19:04.213
Those better be good breaks.

19:04.248 --> 19:06.182
Honestly,
we fell in love with them,

19:06.216 --> 19:09.385
and it just seemed like you guys
didn't really want them.

19:09.419 --> 19:12.288
Sure, you wanted the fun
parts, but do you want to go

19:12.322 --> 19:14.890
to their little league
games and recitals?

19:14.925 --> 19:16.092
We totally have.

19:16.126 --> 19:17.293
Like clockwork.

19:17.327 --> 19:18.928
Well, I'm glad someone has.

19:18.962 --> 19:20.963
Look, before anyone
says anything else,

19:20.998 --> 19:24.533
how could you possibly think
you could get our kids?

19:24.568 --> 19:26.135
It happens more than
you know, Marge.

19:26.169 --> 19:27.937
I'm a lawyer;
he's a surfer.

19:27.971 --> 19:30.106
That combination's
pretty unstoppable.

19:30.140 --> 19:31.307
Well, I'm afraid

19:31.341 --> 19:33.476
that we don't want to be
with anyone but Mom

19:33.510 --> 19:35.311
and whoever
she chooses to be with.

19:35.345 --> 19:37.680
Portia, you're the woman
I dream of becoming,

19:37.714 --> 19:38.914
but Mom is my mom.

19:38.949 --> 19:40.149
Fine,

19:40.183 --> 19:41.817
but you're leaving
a gap in our lives

19:41.852 --> 19:43.552
that can only be filled
by foreign travel,

19:43.587 --> 19:45.321
sleeping late
and gourmet food.

19:45.355 --> 19:46.522
You guys lock up.

19:46.556 --> 19:47.990
We're going to Bali.

19:48.025 --> 19:49.575
Again.

19:49.609 --> 19:50.893
We've won!

19:50.927 --> 19:52.228
Whoo-hoo.

19:55.265 --> 19:56.699
Kids, your father
and I have decided

19:56.733 --> 19:59.802
we're not in such a hurry
to get you guardians.

19:59.836 --> 20:01.737
Instead of
concentrating on dying,

20:01.772 --> 20:04.573
we're going to
concentrate on living.

20:04.608 --> 20:06.008
If you call this living.

20:06.043 --> 20:06.976
Why, you little...

20:08.845 --> 20:10.913
I do call this living.

20:10.947 --> 20:15.123
Living the way kids in India
can only dream of.

20:15.250 --> 20:17.885
There is nothing like
your biological family.
