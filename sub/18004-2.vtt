00:05.105 --> 00:06.705
( Korie )
Willie, are you as
excited as I am

00:06.806 --> 00:07.773
about your
reunion this weekend ?

00:07.841 --> 00:09.074
                       ( Jase )
                       Reunion ?

00:09.175 --> 00:10.743
            Willie, do I have to
            remind you

00:10.844 --> 00:12.778
     how much you've
     changed since high school ?

00:12.846 --> 00:15.080
He still looks
the same.
                   ( laughing )

00:15.181 --> 00:16.648
                    Are you
                    kidding me ?

00:16.750 --> 00:19.118
         You have to say that
         'cause you married him.

00:19.219 --> 00:21.487
           ( Willie )
    Around here, high school
    reunions are a big deal.

00:21.588 --> 00:24.823
   It's a great opportunity to
show off how successful you are,

00:24.924 --> 00:26.825
  how smoking hot your wife is

00:26.926 --> 00:29.328
       and how little hair
          you've lost.

00:29.396 --> 00:30.729
           I'm looking
         forward to it.

00:30.830 --> 00:31.964
                   We're going
                   dove hunting.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.265
                You need to come
                with us.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.833
              You'll have
              a way better time.

00:34.934 --> 00:36.802
He needs to go to his
high school reunion.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.404
It's a big deal.
            I didn't go to mine.

00:38.505 --> 00:39.905
           I went frog-hunting.

00:40.006 --> 00:42.107
        Here's my take on
      high school reunions.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.343
   If I haven't contacted you

00:44.411 --> 00:46.578
      in the last 20 years,

00:46.679 --> 00:48.680
        there's probably
       a reason for that.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.315
              They're not gonna
              know who you were.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.317
                I mean, you are
                unrecognizable.

00:52.419 --> 00:53.519
          What are you
      talking about, son ?

00:53.586 --> 00:55.320
                 This just looks
                 like a kid.

00:55.422 --> 00:57.356
          Now, you look like...

00:57.424 --> 00:59.158
               the sasquatch
               who ate this guy.

01:00.493 --> 01:01.860
                  ( laughing )

01:01.961 --> 01:03.595
       Hey, all I've done
        is grown a beard.

01:03.696 --> 01:05.564
                 And added about
                 a "hundo."

01:05.665 --> 01:07.032
  Jase.
          I haven't gained
             100 pounds.

01:07.133 --> 01:08.267
            Have you
        lost your mind ?

01:08.334 --> 01:09.768
               You're sucking in
               your gut.

01:09.869 --> 01:11.403
         I'm not sucking
            crap in.

01:11.504 --> 01:13.005
            Everybody
    picks up a little weight.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.373
       It's solid weight.

01:14.441 --> 01:16.275
I like a man with
a little meat on his bones.

01:16.342 --> 01:17.376
           Well, let me tell you
           something.

01:17.444 --> 01:20.279
           You hit the jackpot.

01:20.346 --> 01:22.881
       "I like a man with
  a little meat on his bones" ?

01:22.982 --> 01:25.284
       That's polite for,
          "You're fat."

01:25.351 --> 01:27.019
            That boy is
            in there, somewhere,

01:27.087 --> 01:28.520
              screaming, saying,
              "Let me out.

01:28.621 --> 01:29.855
              I've been eaten."

01:29.956 --> 01:32.091
            ( Jase )
    Willie then... handsome.

01:32.158 --> 01:34.793
      Willie now... rotund.

01:34.894 --> 01:36.028
      I've gotten muscular.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.396
                  ( laughing )

01:37.464 --> 01:39.398
    His dimples went from his
          upper cheeks

01:39.466 --> 01:40.899
      to his lower cheeks.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.401
        Don't you need to
          go to work ?

01:42.469 --> 01:44.303
           I'm just trying to
           save you some misery.

01:44.370 --> 01:45.370
We're gonna have fun,
Willie.

01:45.438 --> 01:46.705
It's gonna be great.

01:46.806 --> 01:48.407
        Well, you better get
        ready for the fat jokes.

01:48.475 --> 01:50.275
        Get out of here.

02:13.766 --> 02:15.033
          ( quacking )

02:17.103 --> 02:18.904
( Si )
They ain't really
started flying yet.

02:19.005 --> 02:20.205
            ( Phil )
            Nah, it's too early.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.341
    ( duck whistle calling )

02:22.408 --> 02:24.143
They'll crank up here
in a few minutes.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.644
            ( Jase )
         Hunting doves,

02:25.745 --> 02:27.813
  it's one of my most favorite
           activities

02:27.914 --> 02:29.515
        because doves...

02:29.582 --> 02:32.918
      are the filet mignon
           of the sky.

02:33.019 --> 02:35.154
              I sure would like
              about 15 of them.

02:35.221 --> 02:36.655
       They are delicious.

02:36.756 --> 02:37.856
With some
jalapeno peppers

02:37.957 --> 02:39.525
            and a little of that
            cream cheese

02:39.592 --> 02:40.726
               and then
               wrapped in bacon.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.494
       Scrumptious, tasty.

02:42.595 --> 02:43.595
           Addictive.

02:43.696 --> 02:45.330
                  And grilled to
                  perfection.

02:45.398 --> 02:46.999
     Oh, I'm a dove addict.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.433
           And I don't
        apologize for it.

02:48.501 --> 02:49.768
           They gonna be hard to
           hit in this wind.

02:49.869 --> 02:51.336
            Oh, yeah.

02:51.404 --> 02:54.006
   Especially when they start
      dipping and darting.

02:54.107 --> 02:55.207
             ( Si )
      All right, look here.

02:55.308 --> 02:57.109
   Opening day of dove season,

02:57.210 --> 02:59.778
       I wouldn't say it's
         a competition,

02:59.879 --> 03:01.914
            but, hey,
  I'm fixing to show these boys

03:01.981 --> 03:05.417
       what it sounds like
       when a dove cries.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.652
         Look, here comes three,
         Phil.

03:06.753 --> 03:08.086
       Right there, Phil.

03:08.154 --> 03:09.888
       ( gunshots firing )

03:11.257 --> 03:12.324
                Get 'em, Juju !

03:12.425 --> 03:13.458
         Fetch up, Ruby.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.993
      Hey, look out there.

03:15.061 --> 03:16.261
         I knocked down
           two of them

03:16.329 --> 03:17.829
           and my dog
        didn't even move.

03:17.897 --> 03:19.831
       Ruby, were you even
       paying attention ?

03:19.899 --> 03:21.833
             ( Jase )
             Si, I don't think
             that dog likes you.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.035
          What are you
         talking about ?

03:23.136 --> 03:25.837
    Silas Robertson and dogs,

03:25.905 --> 03:27.940
           they don't
         bond too well.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.975
 I don't know what you over here
     breathing so hard for.

03:30.076 --> 03:31.443
     You ain't done nothing.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.145
            ( Phil )
    You can have a prize lab

03:33.246 --> 03:35.113
  that's trained in every way,

03:35.181 --> 03:36.682
         but they start
      running with old Si,

03:36.783 --> 03:39.218
     they forget everything
      they've ever learned.

03:39.285 --> 03:40.352
    Takes about ten minutes.

03:40.453 --> 03:41.687
       ( dog whimpering )

03:41.788 --> 03:43.188
   No, you can't have my tea,
              Rube.

03:43.256 --> 03:44.456
          No tea, Rube.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.124
   Hey, there's nothing better

03:46.192 --> 03:48.060
        than hunting with
       a man and his dog.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.061
          Eh-eh-eh-eh.

03:49.162 --> 03:50.462
           Nope, nope.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.231
        Hey... you stay.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.233
       That's a bond that
        cannot be broken.

03:54.334 --> 03:55.968
      Nope, Rube, Rube, no.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.803
            But, hey,
   something ain't right here.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.538
    When are you gonna get in
        on the hunt here

03:59.639 --> 04:01.206
           instead of
    sitting there, looking ?

04:01.274 --> 04:02.307
         Hey, look here.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.742
          You're a dog.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.377
   Why do you think they have
            the term,

04:05.478 --> 04:06.778
     "working like a dog" ?

04:06.846 --> 04:08.580
( Phil )
Hey, right here,
right here, coming.

04:08.648 --> 04:10.449
              Here he comes, Si.
           I see him,
      I see him, I see him.

04:10.550 --> 04:11.650
       ( gunshots firing )

04:11.751 --> 04:13.652
                        Uh-oh !

04:13.753 --> 04:15.120
        God, got a piece
          of that one.

04:15.188 --> 04:16.622
         Fetch up here,
            come on.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.457
              Nope, she's going
              on the dove's, Si.

04:18.558 --> 04:19.558
        Good girl, Ruby.

04:19.659 --> 04:20.959
       All right, come on.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.127
        Ruby, fetch up !

04:22.195 --> 04:23.829
                       Uh-oh.
            Come on.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.565
     I have to say that dog
     won't bring it back to you.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.634
  ( laughing )

04:28.735 --> 04:30.435
       Personality issue.

04:30.503 --> 04:31.770
        I've had it with
           this thing.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.472
           Hey, she's
       just rubbing it in.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.474
      Ruby, fetch up here,
            come on.

04:35.575 --> 04:36.975
                  ( Jase )
                  That dog just
                  don't like Si.

04:37.043 --> 04:38.977
     This dog is defective.

04:39.045 --> 04:40.979
        I gotta find out
   if I can return this thing.

04:41.047 --> 04:42.681
               No dogs like Si.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.783
      I'm fixing to retire
          that heifer.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.852
         They smell 'em
         and they get bad vibes.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.290
               ( Willie )
               What coat is it ?

04:51.391 --> 04:52.658
That brown one.

04:52.759 --> 04:54.192
The one I got you
a couple months ago.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.427
                     Oh, yeah.

04:55.495 --> 04:57.195
                     Oh... yep.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.066
                      Ooh.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.100
         Is this mine ?

05:02.201 --> 05:03.669
That's yours.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.704
         Korie, did you leave it
         in the car too long ?

05:05.772 --> 05:08.206
I don't think a sports coat
can shrink, Willie.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.542
         Well... it has shrunk.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.377
           ( Willie )
          Korie's been
   doing this a lot recently.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.112
 She shops at these fancy stores

05:14.213 --> 05:16.548
     that sell clothes for,
   like, little European men.

05:16.616 --> 05:17.582
         They don't fit.

05:17.684 --> 05:19.685
                It's too tight.

05:19.786 --> 05:21.753
           ( Willie )
    She keeps saying they're
  the same size she always buys

05:21.854 --> 05:23.955
      but that's obviously
          not the case.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.290
 Let me button it.

05:25.358 --> 05:26.591
   Well...

05:26.693 --> 05:27.893
            Should I lay down ?

05:27.994 --> 05:29.394
I don't think that's
gonna help.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.263
          Korie, I can't do
          any of my dance moves.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.599
           See, when I go low--
           I can't even go low.

05:34.701 --> 05:37.102
Well, I mean, if you
want to lose a few pounds,

05:37.170 --> 05:38.537
you can come to yoga
with me.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.907
             Yoga ?

05:42.008 --> 05:43.575
          Korie, that's what
          men call "stretching."

05:43.643 --> 05:44.910
       I don't mind losing
          some weight,

05:45.011 --> 05:46.044
           but I ain't
      gonna lose my pride.

05:46.145 --> 05:47.145
         I'm not going to yoga.

05:47.246 --> 05:48.146
               That's for girls.
    Willie.

05:48.247 --> 05:49.614
              I'm not doing it.

05:49.716 --> 05:50.749
    I just need a little bit
     of help to get me back

05:50.817 --> 05:52.117
     to my fighting weight.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.319
             I know how to lose
             weight the man way.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.722
        Luckily, I still
        have my permit...

05:56.823 --> 05:58.557
       for these two guns.

05:58.658 --> 05:59.958
Well, I think
you look good.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.293
              I love you, baby.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.734
    I think I can button it.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.204
     Korie, can you help me
    get out of this jacket ?

06:14.907 --> 06:16.375
           ( Miss Kay )
           Hey, baby, come here.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.143
           I'm cooking--
           You like me cooking ?

06:18.211 --> 06:19.478
            That's what you do.

06:19.579 --> 06:20.479
             You want to eat it,
             don't you ?

06:20.580 --> 06:21.480
( Jase )
Well, hey, Miss Kay.

06:21.581 --> 06:23.715
          Hey, Jase, hey, guys.

06:23.816 --> 06:26.651
                    J.J. is such
                    a good dog.

06:26.753 --> 06:28.420
            That's what she is.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.689
               Such a good dog.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.457
                     Oh, gon.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.192
                Hey, y'all wanna
                eat some rice ?

06:34.260 --> 06:35.527
           You don't like rice.

06:35.628 --> 06:36.995
            ( Phil )
     Miss Kay is a dog lover

06:37.096 --> 06:40.198
  and she will talk to them in
         a kind, loving,

06:40.266 --> 06:41.400
          motherly way.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.301
                 ( whimpering )

06:43.369 --> 06:45.704
     I just whip their butt.

06:45.805 --> 06:46.738
( Jase )
We got you some doves.

06:46.839 --> 06:48.006
                       Oh !

06:48.107 --> 06:49.808
                    I love 'em,
                    I love 'em.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.209
        Well, me and Phil
          got you some.

06:51.277 --> 06:53.078
           Si was just
    there for moral support.

06:53.179 --> 06:54.813
            Si, you couldn't hit
            the doves ?

06:54.881 --> 06:56.515
Oh, hey,
I killed four or five.

06:56.616 --> 06:58.917
I gotta go get me
a real hunting dog.

06:59.018 --> 07:01.486
Emphasis on "hunting."

07:01.554 --> 07:03.889
    You gotta find a dog that
     fits your personality,

07:03.990 --> 07:05.323
         like me, okay ?

07:05.391 --> 07:06.758
        I need to get me
      a natural-born killer

07:06.826 --> 07:08.293
    when it comes to hunting.

07:08.394 --> 07:10.162
    She said, let me show you
     what I think about you.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.730
          ( chomping )

07:11.831 --> 07:12.998
Hey, personality issue.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.332
             ( Si )
      All right, look here.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.768
   You gotta be well-groomed,
           handsome--

07:16.836 --> 07:18.136
        I gotta find one,

07:18.204 --> 07:19.971
         hey, that don't
       mind to take a nap

07:20.039 --> 07:21.506
     every once in a while.

07:21.574 --> 07:23.508
I gotta go find me
a good dog.

07:23.576 --> 07:25.677
               ( Miss Kay )
               I'll go with you,
               I love dogs.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.112
         I have a sense about--

07:27.213 --> 07:28.780
Dogs do love you.

07:28.848 --> 07:31.516
  To get Si a dog, you're gonna
       need a sixth sense

07:31.584 --> 07:32.951
      and maybe a seventh.

07:33.052 --> 07:35.587
         Si's definitely
     not the dog whisperer.

07:35.688 --> 07:36.988
         He scares them.

07:37.056 --> 07:38.824
                     I can find
                     a good dog.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.759
              Look how good J.J.
              and Bobo are.

07:40.860 --> 07:43.128
Kay, it don't take much
to lay on the couch.

07:43.229 --> 07:44.596
I got that down pat.

07:44.697 --> 07:45.997
            ( Jase )
  I mean, the last dog we had,

07:46.065 --> 07:47.833
   the first thing the dog did

07:47.934 --> 07:50.035
           was bite Si
       right on the wrist.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.170
        I mean, Si scares
          humans, too.

07:52.238 --> 07:54.139
          But they just
         don't bite him.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.707
        ( Miss Kay )
        Well, we'll go tomorrow.
 All right.

07:55.775 --> 07:57.676
   Try to find you a dog with
          a screw loose

07:57.777 --> 07:59.611
    so it matches the master.

08:07.687 --> 08:10.088
     Willie, we finally got them
     duck pickers.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.523
               We're caught up.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.258
    Good.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.065
    What ?

08:22.401 --> 08:23.535
          ( exhaling )

08:23.636 --> 08:24.603
           What are you doing ?

08:24.704 --> 08:26.004
Working out.

08:26.072 --> 08:27.806
         That's not working out.
 Yeah, it is.

08:27.907 --> 08:29.307
My arms are burning.

08:29.408 --> 08:31.710
              My eyeballs
              is what's burning.

08:34.046 --> 08:35.847
I just burned
40 calories right then.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.549
                 ( laughing )

08:37.616 --> 08:39.618
  I mean, I don't know whether
      to laugh at Willie...

08:39.719 --> 08:41.186
             or cry.

08:41.254 --> 08:44.856
      I feel like I have to
   laugh to keep from crying.

08:44.924 --> 08:46.224
Jase, I've determined

08:46.292 --> 08:48.226
that I'm gonna
drop a few pounds.

08:48.294 --> 08:50.795
          This is a terrible way
          to do that !

08:50.897 --> 08:53.064
           What if somebody
           sees you doing this ?

08:53.165 --> 08:54.933
Well, most people
knock, but--

08:55.001 --> 08:56.201
                 What is this ?

08:56.269 --> 08:57.602
   Sweat suit.

08:57.703 --> 09:00.739
         What is seen...
        cannot be unseen.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.408
       This is etched into
          my brain now.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.544
         I don't know if
  I feel sorrier for Willie...

09:05.645 --> 09:06.811
           or myself.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.647
                 You've given me
                 a visual image

09:08.748 --> 09:09.714
               that I'm gonna
               have to deal with

09:09.815 --> 09:11.316
           the rest of my life.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.817
     I'm gonna wake up
     in the middle of the night,

09:12.919 --> 09:14.619
                  seeing you...

09:14.720 --> 09:17.622
           doing this with some
           kind of spacesuit on.

09:17.723 --> 09:18.924
It's a sweat suit.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.927
              You need to let me
              help you.

09:23.496 --> 09:24.963
   I would rather put my hair
           in pigtails

09:25.031 --> 09:26.231
         and wear makeup

09:26.299 --> 09:27.933
     than take workout tips
           from Jase.

09:28.034 --> 09:29.100
    No.

09:29.201 --> 09:30.769
        You want to get in shape
        in a hurry ?

09:30.836 --> 09:32.103
              I'll show you
              just how to do it.

09:32.204 --> 09:33.905
        It's real, it's natural

09:34.006 --> 09:35.907
                 and it's manly.
    Jase--

09:36.008 --> 09:38.243
                  I know the way
                  out of this !

09:38.311 --> 09:40.445
 But if he can help me drop some
   wait before this reunion...

09:40.513 --> 09:42.347
                   Are you ready
                   to do this ?

09:42.415 --> 09:44.916
        ... give me some
 ponytail holders and lipstick.

09:45.017 --> 09:47.152
Yes, if you'll get out of
my office and quit yelling.
                    You ready ?

09:47.219 --> 09:48.787
              All right, deal !

09:48.854 --> 09:51.256
         Operation Little Willie
         is in full effect.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.591
That's a terrible name.

09:59.065 --> 10:00.865
            ( Si )
            I'm having a problem
            with my dog.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.867
           He won't bring
           the doves back to me.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.603
           I think he's doing it
           for spite.

10:04.704 --> 10:07.372
Me and him have
a personality issue.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.274
Well, I don't know about
personality.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.343
We've got lots of
dogs here to choose from.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.678
We've got young dogs,
we've got old dogs.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.680
Different breeds of dogs.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.949
             ( Si )
     Hey, this place has got
     all kinds of dogs here.

10:18.050 --> 10:20.385
        Golden terriers,
   they got wiener schnitzels,

10:20.453 --> 10:22.487
     Trans-Siberian huskies.

10:22.588 --> 10:24.556
      I think I'll find me
           a dog here.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.358
This one's got a beard.

10:26.425 --> 10:28.526
Si, this dog
looks like you.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.328
     Looks have got nothing
         to do with it.

10:30.429 --> 10:32.063
        It's all about--
         hey-- attitude.

10:32.164 --> 10:33.798
        Look at that one.

10:33.899 --> 10:35.700
   He's the king of the hill--
        I don't want him.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.003
    You don't want a dog who
      thinks he's too fancy

10:38.070 --> 10:39.971
          for the work
       you want him to do.

10:40.072 --> 10:41.072
      You know, if you get
        a dog like that,

10:41.173 --> 10:42.641
          hey, the next
         thing you know,

10:42.708 --> 10:44.976
     you'll both be getting
       matching pedicures.

10:45.077 --> 10:47.746
              Sit--
     that's what I thought.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.348
Si, you gotta bond
with him, you know ?
          You gotta bond
         with him, Kay ?

10:50.449 --> 10:51.783
               Yeah, of course.

10:51.884 --> 10:53.385
  They love me.

10:53.452 --> 10:54.653
         I know why they
            love you.

10:54.720 --> 10:55.754
                  'Cause I smell
                  like food.

10:55.821 --> 10:56.888
          That's right.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.256
           They always
         love the cook.

10:58.357 --> 11:00.125
                      Right.
       That's what it is.

11:00.192 --> 11:01.926
          ( Miss Kay )
      It's not always easy
         to match a dog

11:02.028 --> 11:03.395
   with someone's personality,

11:03.462 --> 11:05.330
       especially somebody
            like Si.

11:05.431 --> 11:06.598
           ( dogs barking )
      Hey !

11:06.666 --> 11:08.800
          Settle down out there,
          all right.

11:08.901 --> 11:11.002
          If a dog had
        Si's personality,

11:11.103 --> 11:13.638
      it'd be old, cranky,
             mangy,

11:13.739 --> 11:15.073
          lazy, stinky.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.508
             ( Si )
       Hey, you won't do.

11:16.575 --> 11:19.010
     I would never get a nap
      with you around, son.

11:19.111 --> 11:20.945
          ( Miss Kay )
  Basically, if Si were a dog,

11:21.013 --> 11:22.847
   we'd have to put him down.

11:22.948 --> 11:25.083
         Hey, can we take one of
         these for a test run ?

11:25.184 --> 11:27.118
      Sure, we can take one
         for a test run.

11:27.219 --> 11:28.420
             ( Si )
         Hey, look here.

11:28.487 --> 11:31.256
    A dog is just like a car
          or a mattress

11:31.323 --> 11:32.657
      or a tree, you know.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.926
       You gotta test 'em.

11:35.027 --> 11:35.960
      All right, let's see
      what we're gonna do.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.929
          Looking good.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.331
Oh, that is good.
     All right, all right,
     here we go, all right.

11:40.399 --> 11:41.599
            Whoop...

11:43.302 --> 11:44.936
Good luck with that.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.337
                 I've never seen
                 her do that.

11:46.405 --> 11:47.839
     That's a defective dog.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.307
            Well, let's go look
            at some other dogs.

11:49.408 --> 11:50.375
We'll find one, Si.

11:50.476 --> 11:52.043
                We'll find one.

11:52.144 --> 11:54.012
      Yeah, I'll bring DNA
     to you if that'll help.

11:59.852 --> 12:02.020
            ( Jase )
        You gotta harness
      the power of the gut.

12:02.121 --> 12:04.122
( Jep )
Use inertia to your
advantage, come on.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.924
You got it.

12:06.025 --> 12:07.726
There it is.
           There you go.

12:07.793 --> 12:08.960
          You feel it ?

12:09.061 --> 12:11.262
        Why exactly am I cutting
        your firewood ?

12:11.330 --> 12:14.733
    Because I'm training you
        to get in shape.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.736
          I have chosen
     the perfect workout...

12:17.803 --> 12:19.070
           for Willie.

12:19.171 --> 12:20.238
          Lookee there.

12:20.339 --> 12:21.439
           Strike one.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.575
            I was in
    the best shape of my life

12:23.676 --> 12:25.810
       when I cut firewood
          for a living.

12:25.878 --> 12:28.046
    The more swinging you do,

12:28.147 --> 12:30.148
         the more carbs
         you're losing.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.384
    The greatest lesson that
   I learned hauling firewood

12:33.452 --> 12:35.220
       was that if you can
       find somebody else

12:35.321 --> 12:37.589
          to do this...

12:37.690 --> 12:38.790
             do it.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.158
                    This sucks.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.760
       Look, if you don't
          get in shape,

12:41.827 --> 12:44.562
         you're gonna be
     the butt of all jokes.

12:44.630 --> 12:47.298
I sure hope that ax doesn't slip
     and hit you in the gut.

12:47.366 --> 12:48.833
           'Cause then
     gravy's gonna come out.

12:48.901 --> 12:52.237
   ( laughing )

12:52.338 --> 12:54.038
             That's real funny.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.406
     Every time you back up,

12:55.474 --> 12:57.175
       we want the beeping
            to stop.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.144
( laughing )

12:59.245 --> 13:01.379
          How does insulting me
          help me lose weight ?

13:01.447 --> 13:02.847
       This is motivation.

13:02.915 --> 13:04.482
               I'm picturing all
               y'alls faces

13:04.550 --> 13:05.517
                   on the top
                   of this wood.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.352
          That's my motivation.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.488
 I know that reunions are about
  living your high school days,

13:10.556 --> 13:13.358
  but doing Jase's chores while
  he and Jep are sitting around

13:13.459 --> 13:15.727
         cracking jokes
   is not what I had in mind.

13:15.828 --> 13:17.529
                 What if I just
                 go into a gym ?

13:17.630 --> 13:18.730
           ( sighing )

13:18.831 --> 13:20.865
       You have got to be
           kidding me.

13:20.933 --> 13:23.201
        That's why people
        go to gyms, to work out.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.502
         Wear the little
          shorty-shorts

13:24.570 --> 13:26.504
           and prance
        around in a gym ?

13:26.572 --> 13:28.006
            ( Jase )
      When you're in a gym,

13:28.107 --> 13:30.275
      you're getting up on
       a stationary bike--

13:30.376 --> 13:31.776
              why ?

13:31.844 --> 13:33.545
   You're not going anywhere.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.579
        You got all this.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.181
       This is God's gym.

13:36.282 --> 13:40.585
        When I work out,
       I'm working out...

13:40.686 --> 13:41.886
              side.

13:41.954 --> 13:44.222
          Plus, I need
        my firewood cut.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.124
     I'm telling you, you're
        looking slimmer.

13:46.225 --> 13:47.892
      Don't you feel good ?

13:47.960 --> 13:49.727
                   No, I don't.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.429
             Uh-oh !

13:51.497 --> 13:53.364
          ( chuckling )

13:53.465 --> 13:54.766
            Man down.

13:54.867 --> 13:55.767
                   I'm done.

13:55.868 --> 13:57.168
         Come on, Will.

13:57.236 --> 13:58.436
          It's just one
          little knot.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.171
            You gotta
       get mad at the knot

14:00.239 --> 14:02.774
     and say, "Hey, I'm not
     gonna let you beat me."

14:02.875 --> 14:04.509
      You know why you hurt
           your back ?

14:04.610 --> 14:07.812
        'Cause you hadn't
  been doing this in 20 years.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.147
    You want Martin to rub it
          out for you ?

14:09.248 --> 14:10.348
( Jep )
Give him
a rubdown, Martin.

14:10.416 --> 14:12.217
             ( Martin )
             No, no, no, no, no.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.786
      He don't pay me to rub his
      back, that's for sure.

14:14.887 --> 14:17.655
       Let that back pain
       send you a message.

14:17.756 --> 14:18.656
         "Hey, Willie...

14:18.757 --> 14:20.792
            put down
        the bacon bits."

14:20.893 --> 14:22.227
    He didn't even get to finish
    the second part,

14:22.328 --> 14:23.561
                  stacking it.

14:23.629 --> 14:25.697
            That works them legs
            and the buttocks.

14:25.798 --> 14:26.731
                  You want to
                  get in shape ?

14:26.799 --> 14:28.032
No, I'm busy.

14:28.133 --> 14:30.068
This tea is not gonna
drink itself, Jase.

14:30.169 --> 14:31.402
                      Well...

14:31.503 --> 14:33.805
              Reed, Cole,
              got a job for you.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.580
            ( woman )
 Toes together, knees out wide,

14:42.648 --> 14:43.882
     and push your bum back
       towards your heels.

14:43.983 --> 14:45.083
          Breathe in--

14:45.184 --> 14:46.084
            Come on,
    lift your bum up, Willie.

14:46.185 --> 14:47.218
          Send it up to
            the sky.

14:47.286 --> 14:48.920
              Out.

14:49.021 --> 14:50.755
           ( Willie )
          I know I said
     I would never do yoga,

14:50.823 --> 14:52.490
      but, hey, after that
         day with Jase,

14:52.558 --> 14:55.293
    it's time to find a more
 relaxing way to get into shape.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.395
( woman )
Breathe in, down dog.

14:57.463 --> 14:58.496
           ( Willie )
        What can I say ?

14:58.564 --> 14:59.764
   When the going gets tough,

14:59.832 --> 15:01.799
       the tough strap on
          camo tights.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.234
( woman )
Breath in.
           Down dog means your--

15:03.302 --> 15:05.003
                  Make your body
                  like a "V."

15:05.104 --> 15:06.137
                   There you go.
       That ain't nothing
           like a dog.

15:06.205 --> 15:07.739
       Breathe in.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.942
      Willie has absolutely
    no idea how hard yoga is.

15:11.043 --> 15:12.443
       The dog does this,
           he's sick.

15:12.544 --> 15:14.913
Bring your
toes together.

15:15.014 --> 15:18.016
            I'm gonna
     enjoy seeing him sweat.

15:18.117 --> 15:19.183
    Up dog.

15:19.285 --> 15:20.652
             Up dog.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.220
Left foot forward,
Warrior I.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.256
           ( Willie )
        They should give
        these poses names

15:25.324 --> 15:28.793
      that reflect reality,
      like "spine snapper."

15:28.861 --> 15:30.528
  Where are we--
           Hold onto the straps,
           Willie.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.030
        Lift your chest.
                   There you go.

15:32.131 --> 15:34.299
Why don't you put
an apple in my mouth, too ?

15:34.400 --> 15:35.333
     Or "wheelchair-bound."

15:35.401 --> 15:36.968
            ( woman )
        Bridge or wheel.

15:37.036 --> 15:38.436
  You can come into a back bend
         if you'd like.

15:38.504 --> 15:39.837
         Put your hands
          by your ears.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.773
       Go up, lift, lift.
    ( Willie )
    Oh Lord, no.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.207
Y'all got a bridge,
I got a ditch.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.009
    Or "humanly impossible."

15:45.110 --> 15:47.712
            ( woman )
    If anybody wants to take
    headstand here, you can.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.047
Uh-uh, that ain't
happening.

15:49.148 --> 15:50.615
          I'm about to
       create my own pose.

15:50.683 --> 15:51.916
          ( sneezing )

15:51.984 --> 15:53.284
        "Dying fat man."

15:53.352 --> 15:54.719
          Breathe in, reach up.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.220
I'm-- I got
the breathing in.

15:56.322 --> 15:58.056
             Okay.
That's happening
naturally.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.357
            Release.

15:59.425 --> 16:01.259
   ( exhaling )

16:01.327 --> 16:03.428
         Let's come into
           happy baby.

16:05.164 --> 16:06.364
       Let's rock a little
         back and forth.

16:06.432 --> 16:07.532
          Who comes up
       with these words ?

16:08.801 --> 16:10.702
Korie, look how
ridiculous this is.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.769
            Hey, Mom.

16:11.870 --> 16:13.104
                 Oh, hey, baby.

16:13.172 --> 16:14.372
              Come on in,
              we're almost done.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.873
             Bella, look at this
             happy baby.

16:18.610 --> 16:19.844
   Phil...

16:19.945 --> 16:21.779
I thought Kay was
picking up Bella for me.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.915
         What y'all got
          going here ?
                 Oh, my Lord.

16:24.016 --> 16:26.417
           ( Willie )
 There's a lot of words I would
      use to describe this.

16:26.518 --> 16:28.286
   "Happy" is not one of them.

16:28.387 --> 16:29.854
                       ( Korie )
                       Oh.
Phil, it's not
what it looks like.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.223
            ( Phil )
             Danger.

16:32.324 --> 16:35.059
   ( imitating alarm beeping )

16:35.160 --> 16:36.260
      Red lights blinking.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.628
      Phil !

16:37.696 --> 16:40.064
        What in the world
    has happened to my boy ?

16:40.165 --> 16:41.332
       Dad !

16:41.433 --> 16:42.700
            ( Phil )
            Yuppies.

16:42.801 --> 16:44.435
   Oh, my God.

16:44.536 --> 16:46.304
I'm never gonna
hear the end of this.

16:46.405 --> 16:47.605
I'm not a happy baby.

16:51.810 --> 16:53.711
             ( Jase )
             I can't believe you
             bought that dog.

16:53.812 --> 16:56.314
             ( Si )
       Hey, don't badmouth
           my dog now.

16:56.415 --> 16:57.982
That's some hairdo there.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.218
       Hey, he ain't in no
   beauty contest, all right ?

17:00.319 --> 17:02.153
                Si, you've just
                gone slap crazy.

17:02.254 --> 17:03.321
               No.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.790
           Si, that's a poodle.

17:05.891 --> 17:06.858
              Hey.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.126
             I know.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.028
       Look at the statue
         on this thing.

17:10.095 --> 17:13.164
        I mean, he's got
 "killer" written all over him.

17:13.265 --> 17:15.165
               You're more blind
               than I thought.

17:15.267 --> 17:17.734
     Hey, poodles are one of
the best hunting dogs there are,

17:17.803 --> 17:19.237
      everybody knows that.

17:19.338 --> 17:22.807
That dog there was
bred for a fancy person.

17:22.907 --> 17:25.742
    And by the way, poodles,
 they don't give a rat's behind

17:25.810 --> 17:27.545
     about what other people
        think about 'em.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.647
        Hey, guess what ?
          Just like me.

17:29.748 --> 17:32.350
      That's what old women have
      and people of royalty.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.819
       Well, just call me
             Prince.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.587
            You know,
        what can I say ?

17:36.655 --> 17:39.190
     Si's dog... ridiculous.

17:39.291 --> 17:40.691
         I mean, the dog
         has got style.

17:40.759 --> 17:42.126
          Embarrassing.

17:42.194 --> 17:43.227
               I've never seen
               anything like it.

17:43.295 --> 17:44.929
             Stupid.

17:45.030 --> 17:46.831
  This sucker is a hunting dog
      now, I'm telling you.

17:46.932 --> 17:48.966
       Sometimes I really
       think he is insane.

17:49.034 --> 17:50.835
I tell you one thing,
he got a set of "cods"

17:50.936 --> 17:54.105
on him that would make old
Arnold Schwarzenegger blush.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.240
          He's all man,
     don't ever doubt that.

17:56.308 --> 17:57.942
      With a haircut like that,

17:58.043 --> 17:59.944
           he better have
           a set of cods on him.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.846
        I guarantee you.
                'Cause he's
                gonna need 'em.

18:01.947 --> 18:04.115
    Elvis had a hairdo, too,
      and look how he done.

18:05.384 --> 18:06.784
                    ( laughing )
            Hey.

18:06.852 --> 18:07.819
           Is that your logic ?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.353
   If we ever kill any doves,

18:09.421 --> 18:11.456
      y'all gonna take back
       all these bad words

18:11.557 --> 18:13.024
           y'all been
      talking about my dog.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.293
Uh-oh,
we got one that's blind.

18:15.394 --> 18:17.328
     He's leaning, he's leaning,
     he's leaning.

18:17.396 --> 18:18.563
                      Try him.

18:19.965 --> 18:21.766
      All right, fetch up,
           Coot, back.

18:23.068 --> 18:24.368
                Oh my goodness.

18:24.470 --> 18:27.271
            That dog is going to
            get that dove.

18:27.339 --> 18:29.807
            ( Jase )
       The poodle actually

18:29.875 --> 18:32.610
        retrieves doves.

18:32.678 --> 18:34.312
( Phil )
If I hadn't have seen it,
I wouldn't have believed it.

18:34.413 --> 18:35.947
            Good boy.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.683
I'll never badmouth another
poodle as long as I live.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.384
            ( Phil )
     We might all break out
        with the poodles

18:40.486 --> 18:42.086
          if we can get
     past the embarrassment

18:42.154 --> 18:44.355
   of having them ride in your
         truck with you.

18:44.423 --> 18:45.957
        Somebody sees you
    with a poodle, that's a--

18:46.058 --> 18:47.592
    Kind of a scary thought.

18:47.693 --> 18:50.361
       Good work, killer,
            good dog.

18:50.429 --> 18:53.898
     That right there, hey,
   that's a Si Robertson dog.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.134
              ( Jase )
              I think Si's found
              his soul mate.

18:56.235 --> 18:58.803
             ( Si )
       Old Mr. Fancypants
        ain't bad, Jase.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.240
( Bella )
Where's Mom ?

19:02.341 --> 19:03.441
She's taking forever.

19:03.542 --> 19:04.775
                 Hurry up, Mom.

19:04.877 --> 19:05.977
            ( Korie )
    All right, y'all ready ?

19:06.078 --> 19:07.778
        Yeah.
                        Yeah.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.580
             Whoa !

19:09.648 --> 19:10.982
             Mama !

19:11.083 --> 19:12.083
   You like it ?

19:12.184 --> 19:13.384
              Yeah.

19:13.452 --> 19:14.719
Do I still got it
after all these years ?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.087
          Yeah, you do.

19:16.188 --> 19:18.456
      Now let's see if Dad
          still has it.

19:18.557 --> 19:19.891
Come on, Willie.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.259
        Can't rush this.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.594
Oh, looking good,
looking good.

19:23.695 --> 19:26.264
 Well, it's come to my attention
     that since high school

19:26.365 --> 19:27.899
           I've put on
        a little weight.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.101
           No, not you, Dad.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.103
        Pipe down, Sadie.

19:32.204 --> 19:36.440
 So... I've been on a strenuous
        exercise program.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.810
           This jacket
       has become a symbol

19:39.912 --> 19:42.246
     of the new, thinner me.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.281
           This is it.

19:43.382 --> 19:44.849
      The moment of truth.

19:44.917 --> 19:45.950
       Let's hope it fits.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.185
All right, go for it,
Will.

19:47.286 --> 19:48.286
         Drumroll, Will.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.123
         A little help.
  All right.

19:53.659 --> 19:54.625
Let's see.

19:54.726 --> 19:56.494
 Ooh !
                       Yeah.

19:56.562 --> 19:58.629
Oh, and it
even buttons.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.631
            It does.
     Wow.

20:00.732 --> 20:03.034
      Holy crap, this thing
         actually fits ?

20:03.135 --> 20:04.368
That looks good.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.438
            You see ?

20:07.506 --> 20:09.874
    Hard work and dedication
       actually pays off.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.842
         And I still got
   a little room for dancing.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.477
Yeah, and you
look good.

20:13.579 --> 20:16.347
  A good wife will support her
     husband no matter what.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.216
Just as hot as you
were when I married you.

20:18.317 --> 20:19.650
                       Oh, man.

20:19.751 --> 20:21.485
            ( Korie )
 A great wife saves the receipt

20:21.587 --> 20:23.454
  and takes the jacket back for
        a bigger size...

20:23.522 --> 20:25.122
     when nobody's looking.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.190
        All right, kids,
         we're leaving.

20:26.291 --> 20:27.291
                        Bye !

20:27.392 --> 20:28.426
      Don't wait up for us.

20:30.128 --> 20:31.862
              You better not do
              too much dancing.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.965
      One of those buttons will
      pop off and kill somebody.

20:35.434 --> 20:36.367
( Miss Kay )
Something smell good ?

20:36.435 --> 20:37.868
                     ( Phil )
                     Ooh.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.237
     That would make
     a hound dog hug a kitty cat

20:39.338 --> 20:41.305
           on a frosty morning.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.307
           ( Willie )
 Sometimes when you look back on
    where you start in life,

20:43.408 --> 20:45.142
       you feel nostalgic.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.613
 Other times, you feel like you
  need to lose 20 or 30 pounds.

20:48.714 --> 20:50.748
        It's easy to make
excuses for some of the mistakes

20:50.849 --> 20:52.450
   you've made along the way,

20:52.517 --> 20:54.552
         but ultimately,
     if you want to change,

20:54.620 --> 20:56.220
        the weight is on
         your shoulders.

20:56.321 --> 20:57.888
            Or belt.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.790
 I guess I'm just grateful that
        I have my family

20:59.891 --> 21:01.759
   to help me reach my goals,

21:01.860 --> 21:05.462
 even if that involves fat jokes
        and camo tights.
