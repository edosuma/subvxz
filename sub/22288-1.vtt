01:04.340 --> 01:05.361
Lighter touch.

01:05.441 --> 01:07.665
- Hey.
- Good.

01:07.745 --> 01:09.763
I think she's looking at me.

01:11.382 --> 01:13.878
All right, let's watch our proportions...

01:13.958 --> 01:17.241
...lines, and shading.

01:18.021 --> 01:19.834
Most important...

01:19.914 --> 01:23.206
...let's make life on the page.

01:23.486 --> 01:25.549
"Life on the page."

01:25.629 --> 01:28.248
Not just drawing body parts, people.

01:34.571 --> 01:36.427
Very nice.

01:37.007 --> 01:38.886
Nice work, Luke.

01:48.384 --> 01:50.664
He was, like, super nice to me.

01:55.858 --> 01:57.677
Here we go.

02:11.042 --> 02:12.963
Are you going to sketch naked people?

02:13.043 --> 02:14.798
- Yeah.
- That sounds awkward.

02:14.878 --> 02:17.069
It's... it's really awkward, actually.

02:40.036 --> 02:41.614
Fuck.

02:50.516 --> 02:51.898
Is that me?

03:18.541 --> 03:21.361
All right, guys. What do you think?

03:28.184 --> 03:31.509
Well, to me, it kind of looks like
something you did last semester.

03:31.589 --> 03:35.579
I mean, I'm just having a hard time placing
the emotion behind the expression.

03:35.659 --> 03:38.515
Yeah is... is that your intention?

03:38.595 --> 03:42.452
This just looks like something a 16-year-old
girl painted in her mom's basement.

03:44.501 --> 03:46.624
I really like the line quality.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.788
It just feels a little bit tame.

03:52.242 --> 03:54.565
I'm hoping that when it's finished...

03:54.645 --> 03:57.682
...that it invites the viewer
to look closer...

03:57.762 --> 04:01.817
- ...at the emotion that's not typical.
- Yeah, we're not noticing emotion.

04:02.552 --> 04:04.770
We're noticing you censoring yourself.

04:05.955 --> 04:09.372
Look, the technique is there, but...

04:09.935 --> 04:11.850
...that's not enough.

04:12.529 --> 04:14.352
Not anymore.

04:14.982 --> 04:18.387
What are you thinking
for your thesis exhibition?

04:19.067 --> 04:22.159
Portraits, photorealism, the stages of life.

04:22.239 --> 04:25.125
The stages of life. Come on, Noelle.

04:26.809 --> 04:28.632
Get messy.

04:28.912 --> 04:30.467
Fail!

04:30.547 --> 04:32.770
Fail miserably. All right?

04:32.850 --> 04:37.091
Make something ugly. Who cares?
Fuck it. That's why you're here, right?

04:38.588 --> 04:40.039
Right?

04:42.925 --> 04:45.210
Let's jump in the deep end this year.

04:45.828 --> 04:48.114
Shane, you're up.

05:11.554 --> 05:15.408
Actually, I'll meet you guys there.
But just one second.

05:21.547 --> 05:23.604
What's up? What's up?

05:23.684 --> 05:25.552
- How are you?
- I'm good.

05:25.632 --> 05:28.056
Can I just see what you're doing?

05:29.171 --> 05:31.023
Let me see.

05:33.843 --> 05:36.467
Yeah, this is cool. I like this a lot.

05:38.781 --> 05:40.804
"Thank you, Luke."
You could just say thank you.

05:40.884 --> 05:43.240
- That's a totally appropriate response...
- Thank you.

05:43.320 --> 05:46.277
...when someone gives you a compliment.
Awesome. You did it.

05:46.357 --> 05:50.581
I like this. This is good. So my roommates
and I are having a party tonight.

05:50.661 --> 05:52.916
I'd really love for you to come.
You want to come?

05:52.996 --> 05:56.087
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Great. Awesome.

05:56.567 --> 05:58.221
- Cool. So I'll see you there?
- Yeah.

05:58.301 --> 06:00.130
All right, cool.

06:13.481 --> 06:15.323
- Yeah?
- Hey.

06:15.403 --> 06:17.638
Do you mind if I use your washer again?

06:17.718 --> 06:21.305
Yeah, there's a... there's a key in the
flower pot. You can use it whenever.

06:21.385 --> 06:24.662
Amazing. Thank you so much.

06:25.562 --> 06:27.955
Look at you, hot stuff.

06:28.265 --> 06:31.128
What are you doing? Are you going on a date?

06:31.984 --> 06:35.480
- It's just, like, a party thing.
- A party thing.

06:36.806 --> 06:40.664
You know, you should dress like this
more, Elle. You got a hot body.

06:40.744 --> 06:43.167
You don't think it looks like
I'm trying too hard?

06:43.247 --> 06:45.469
I think trying is a good look.

06:46.499 --> 06:50.257
Are you meeting someone special
at the party thing?

06:52.487 --> 06:56.049
I mean, there's this guy,
but I don't even know if he's into me.

06:56.139 --> 06:59.481
Of course he's into you,
why wouldn't he be into you?

06:59.561 --> 07:02.631
You know what you should do?
You should invite him over...

07:02.711 --> 07:06.590
...for a midnight swim. That's my move.

07:06.970 --> 07:10.080
- A midnight swim?
- Works like a charm.

07:10.360 --> 07:14.232
How does it even go?
I mean, are you just, like...

07:14.812 --> 07:17.874
"Hey, attractive guy.

07:17.954 --> 07:20.805
Do you want to come over
for a midnight swim?"

07:21.618 --> 07:24.706
Yeah, yeah. That's kind of...

07:28.424 --> 07:30.308
I'm terrible at this.

07:31.695 --> 07:33.383
A little bit.

07:33.463 --> 07:36.467
It's okay. You don't invite
any guys over, ever, do you?

07:36.547 --> 07:41.358
I just don't have time. I mean,
just school and stuff, you know?

07:41.438 --> 07:44.628
Okay, let's think. Tonight, the party thing.

07:44.708 --> 07:46.609
You're going to dance with him.

07:48.311 --> 07:50.726
I don't think it's really a...

07:51.890 --> 07:55.505
- ...dancing thing.
- It does not matter.

07:55.585 --> 07:59.943
Guys are guys. You don't need game
to hook up with a guy. You could say...

08:00.023 --> 08:02.679
"...peas and carrots" and they're down.

08:02.759 --> 08:06.145
- Peas and carrots?
- Peas and carrots.

08:09.298 --> 08:11.188
Peas and carrots.

08:11.868 --> 08:13.824
Peas and carrots.

08:13.904 --> 08:15.163
Again.

08:16.373 --> 08:19.463
- Peas and carrots.
- Yes!

08:19.543 --> 08:20.893
So good.

08:51.073 --> 08:53.898
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:54.678 --> 08:57.006
I have always wanted to be an artist, but...

08:57.326 --> 09:01.719
...I actually feel like I might be moving
away from painting as a practice.

09:01.799 --> 09:03.941
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.523
But you're so good.

09:05.603 --> 09:07.744
I think I've always had
a talent for painting and drawing...

09:07.824 --> 09:09.980
...I think it's something
that came naturally.

09:10.060 --> 09:13.317
But I don't know. Like, when I think
about my life moving forward...

09:13.397 --> 09:15.352
...and, like, my art, I feel like I'm...

09:15.432 --> 09:19.486
...like, what would it mean to develop
a practice that didn't include painting?

09:19.566 --> 09:22.025
You know? Like what
does it mean to approach...

09:22.105 --> 09:25.496
...like, a non-painting discipline
as a painter? Do you know...

09:25.576 --> 09:27.460
Luke, hey.

09:27.540 --> 09:31.635
Sorry, I missed your thing. But you're
doing it next weekend, and I'm there.

09:31.715 --> 09:34.039
- Yeah, you better be.
- Okay.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.141
Sorry about that.

09:36.221 --> 09:41.247
Was I seriously just, like, going on about
the kind of art practice I want to have?

09:41.825 --> 09:44.715
- Yeah, but it's fine.
- Am I literally the worst person ever?

09:44.795 --> 09:48.619
No. No, no, no. I love
listening to you talk about art.

09:49.699 --> 09:52.935
Okay, good, because I was really
enjoying the conversation.

09:53.870 --> 09:56.796
Usually that shit feels false, and it didn't.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.300
Okay.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.828
- Welcome. Welcome.
- Thank you.

10:16.126 --> 10:20.821
Okay. I told you I wanted to take
things in a new direction, and...

10:21.576 --> 10:24.254
...yeah, I started making ceramics.

10:24.334 --> 10:26.790
You got to imagine them
like a hundred times this size...

10:26.870 --> 10:30.060
...because I imagine them, like, in parks.
What do you think?

10:30.140 --> 10:33.226
Yeah, I think they're cool.
I mean, this one...

10:34.877 --> 10:36.203
...they're cool.

10:37.413 --> 10:40.214
I think it's cool that you're
just trying something new.

11:21.290 --> 11:24.268
Oh, my gosh, you're so fucking sexy.

11:45.916 --> 11:48.705
Oh, my God. Luke...

11:48.785 --> 11:50.670
Oh, my God.

11:51.442 --> 11:53.281
You like that, baby?

11:55.161 --> 11:58.215
- Hold on a second.
- You like that?

11:58.295 --> 12:00.951
- Oh, fuck, you're so fucking tight.
- No, no.

12:02.733 --> 12:05.756
- Yeah, lay back.
- No. No.

12:05.836 --> 12:08.931
Be good. Be good, okay?

12:09.011 --> 12:11.490
- Be good.
- No, no. Please.

12:13.742 --> 12:17.214
- No.
- Be good. Be a good girl now.

12:21.150 --> 12:22.501
Oh, my God.

12:26.401 --> 12:31.079
No, stay, stay. Stay. Stay.
Stay. Stay. Stay. Stay.

12:31.159 --> 12:33.016
Oh, yeah.

12:33.096 --> 12:35.099
No, no.

12:38.834 --> 12:40.424
Fucking...

12:40.934 --> 12:44.227
Oh, my God. You're so fucking tight.
Oh, you're so fucking tight.

12:44.307 --> 12:46.930
Please. Please no.

12:47.410 --> 12:50.267
Yeah, get ready. Fucking ready.

12:52.185 --> 12:55.452
Get down. Get down. Oh, my God.

12:56.082 --> 12:57.954
Oh, fuck, yeah.

13:50.672 --> 13:52.547
That was so fucking good.

13:58.817 --> 14:00.894
Here, let me get you a towel.

15:53.729 --> 15:55.318
Hello?

15:56.998 --> 15:59.825
Hey. Want to go grab some food?

16:00.236 --> 16:03.369
No. No, I'm good.

16:04.606 --> 16:06.363
What's wrong?

16:06.443 --> 16:08.338
I'm just really tired.

16:15.718 --> 16:17.741
You look pale.

16:17.921 --> 16:19.772
I'm fine.

16:27.797 --> 16:29.635
Did something happen?

16:36.872 --> 16:39.776
You know you can talk to me, right?

16:42.778 --> 16:47.676
I went to go see that guy last night
and everything was fine and then...

16:48.668 --> 16:49.953
...and then...

16:53.222 --> 16:57.091
...we went to his bedroom, and he, like...

17:01.730 --> 17:03.315
Hey.

17:04.465 --> 17:06.009
Okay.

17:16.712 --> 17:18.597
What happened?

17:20.115 --> 17:23.770
All of a sudden he was,
like, all over me, and...

17:27.222 --> 17:29.037
...I don't even know.

17:38.150 --> 17:40.102
It's okay.

17:40.337 --> 17:42.194
You're okay.

17:43.573 --> 17:46.063
I have to tell someone, Skye.

17:46.543 --> 17:49.232
- Like who?
- Like the school at least.

17:49.312 --> 17:50.856
No.

17:52.181 --> 17:54.200
No. Listen to me.

17:56.085 --> 17:57.941
I have a friend.

17:58.921 --> 18:02.614
Something similar happened to her,
and she told the school.

18:04.094 --> 18:07.956
And they made her feel like shit.
They told her she was...

18:09.536 --> 18:12.385
...a slut, basically, that she was crazy.

18:15.020 --> 18:17.248
No, you're not going to go to them.

18:18.574 --> 18:20.462
You told me...

18:21.647 --> 18:23.490
...and I believe you.

18:24.547 --> 18:26.398
It was one night.

18:27.383 --> 18:30.069
Okay? One shitty night.

18:32.221 --> 18:35.108
Don't let it ruin the rest of your life.

18:39.461 --> 18:41.313
Come here.

18:48.604 --> 18:52.028
Today we'll be discussing Hieronymus Bosch.

18:52.508 --> 18:55.098
And as you see on the screen here...

18:55.178 --> 18:58.047
...we are looking at "The Last Judgment."

18:58.448 --> 19:01.306
In this project, we see the Garden of Eden...

19:01.386 --> 19:05.005
...and the God is shown seated in heaven...

19:09.058 --> 19:11.531
...the center receives the damned souls.

19:11.611 --> 19:14.204
The torture scenes continue in this panel...

19:14.284 --> 19:16.435
- ...within the dark landscape...
- Hey.

19:16.515 --> 19:19.055
...dominated by flames and demolition.

19:19.135 --> 19:20.953
Are you okay?

19:27.476 --> 19:29.755
...as you can see on the right panel...

19:31.562 --> 19:33.106
...it's not different.

19:43.025 --> 19:45.649
Thank you for sharing that, Noelle.

19:46.329 --> 19:49.186
I can only imagine how difficult.

19:50.066 --> 19:52.089
What are you feeling right now?

19:52.969 --> 19:54.805
I feel like...

19:55.571 --> 19:57.825
...he could do it again.

20:04.263 --> 20:06.319
When did this happen?

20:07.149 --> 20:08.969
Last Friday.

20:09.319 --> 20:13.643
Isn't there a test or something I can do?

20:13.723 --> 20:16.174
Like a rape kit?

20:16.492 --> 20:18.917
Was he wearing a condom?

20:20.512 --> 20:22.504
- No.
- Then, yes...

20:22.584 --> 20:26.695
...I would say getting tested
for STIs is probably a good idea.

20:26.775 --> 20:31.027
As far as the rape kit,
I'm assuming you've showered.

20:32.507 --> 20:33.930
Okay.

20:34.010 --> 20:36.700
Did anyone else see this happen?

20:37.980 --> 20:39.270
No.

20:40.550 --> 20:44.050
I mean, people saw us
go to his room together...

20:44.130 --> 20:47.239
...but no one was in the room.

20:49.491 --> 20:51.715
How much did you have to drink, Noelle?

20:54.822 --> 20:56.595
A beer?

21:00.802 --> 21:02.855
Did you ever say "no"?

21:04.406 --> 21:07.567
- Yes.
- You just told me...

21:07.647 --> 21:11.534
...you said, "wait," but did you
ever use the word "no"?

21:11.614 --> 21:13.835
- Yes.
- Are you sure...

21:13.915 --> 21:16.556
...that you said "no" and that he heard you?

22:11.173 --> 22:12.744
Yo.

22:14.343 --> 22:16.166
Come in.

22:16.546 --> 22:18.668
Do you want a drink or something, or...

22:18.748 --> 22:20.270
I'm smoking.

22:20.350 --> 22:21.904
No.

22:22.384 --> 22:25.041
God, I'm so fucking tired.

22:25.121 --> 22:28.244
This house becomes, like, a fucking zoo...

22:28.324 --> 22:31.180
...and, like, these people
were over till, like, 5 a.m.

22:31.260 --> 22:34.079
Sometimes you're just like,
"I need my space."

22:39.534 --> 22:41.368
Sure you don't want it?

22:43.872 --> 22:45.570
What's up with you?

22:48.944 --> 22:51.230
I want you to say you're sorry.

22:56.101 --> 22:57.773
For what?

22:57.853 --> 23:00.700
For what happened
the other night in your room.

23:01.991 --> 23:04.076
I want you to say you're sorry.

23:10.098 --> 23:12.589
You want me to apologize for fucking you?

23:12.969 --> 23:14.825
That's not what happened.

23:16.538 --> 23:20.120
And what do you think happened in my room?
Why are you looking at me like that?

23:20.200 --> 23:22.499
What the fuck's wrong with you?

23:23.679 --> 23:26.480
You raped me.

23:27.016 --> 23:28.867
Excuse me?

23:33.166 --> 23:35.234
That's fucking rich.

23:37.392 --> 23:39.683
Stop being so fucking sensitive.

23:40.413 --> 23:43.586
- You were into it. You liked it.
- That's not what happened.

23:43.666 --> 23:47.674
Come on. Don't give me that shit.
Go fucking read me a Jezebel article.

23:48.542 --> 23:50.297
What the fuck?

23:53.274 --> 23:57.150
Don't fucking do that. You know what?
If you're going to act this way, just...

23:57.230 --> 24:00.074
...you can just leave, all right?
I'm sick of this.

24:02.584 --> 24:04.441
You can let yourself out.

24:05.021 --> 24:08.549
- I said you can let yourself out.
- Luke. I want you to admit...

24:10.258 --> 24:13.991
- Fucking crazy. Stop acting crazy.
- I'm not crazy!

26:18.722 --> 26:21.721
We got a picture knocked down
in the upstairs hallway.

26:21.801 --> 26:24.347
We got a 911 call from one of his roommate.

26:24.427 --> 26:26.845
Probably out of his mind on something.

26:29.164 --> 26:31.451
We're dusting for prints...

27:02.597 --> 27:04.186
Hey.

27:04.734 --> 27:07.022
Did you hear about Luke?

27:07.102 --> 27:09.154
He fell off his balcony.

27:12.807 --> 27:14.673
Hey, guys.

27:16.122 --> 27:18.165
I'm canceling class today.

27:19.881 --> 27:22.605
The counseling center is across
the quad if you need to talk.

27:22.685 --> 27:25.487
Of course, my door is always open, so...

27:27.222 --> 27:29.112
You guys take it easy.

27:39.868 --> 27:43.192
Noelle Posero. Detective Kennedy.

27:43.272 --> 27:45.891
I'd like to ask you
a few questions, if I may.

27:48.693 --> 27:50.713
Did you see Luke last night?

27:52.817 --> 27:54.337
Yeah.

27:55.517 --> 27:57.536
Do you remember what time?

27:59.537 --> 28:02.029
Probably around 7:00 or 8:00.

28:03.359 --> 28:05.481
And you went over there for what?

28:05.561 --> 28:08.625
To talk. He texted me.

28:10.865 --> 28:13.552
He texted you because he wanted to talk?

28:15.503 --> 28:17.973
He probably wanted to hook up.

28:22.577 --> 28:24.400
How long did you stay?

28:24.780 --> 28:26.599
Not long.

28:27.844 --> 28:29.071
Why?

28:29.151 --> 28:31.574
I wasn't in the mood last night...

28:32.854 --> 28:35.077
...and he was pretty gone.

28:36.457 --> 28:39.694
- What was he on?
- I'm not sure.

28:40.229 --> 28:42.281
I'm not into that sort of thing.

28:48.302 --> 28:51.567
Was there anybody else at the house
when you two were there?

28:52.308 --> 28:54.563
Not that I saw, but...

28:55.709 --> 28:57.865
...I didn't stay long.

29:04.786 --> 29:09.266
My card, in case anything else
comes up, give me a call.

29:12.313 --> 29:13.854
Noelle...

29:14.965 --> 29:17.206
...I'm sorry about your friend Luke.

29:20.235 --> 29:22.079
Thank you.

30:23.298 --> 30:26.985
Come on, baby. Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

30:30.639 --> 30:32.891
This is what you wanted when you came around.

30:37.812 --> 30:40.168
Fuck. That was seriously good.

30:40.248 --> 30:43.172
- I think she's thirsty, I think she's thirsty.
- It's water. It's just water.

30:43.252 --> 30:44.906
- It's just water.
- It's just water.

30:44.986 --> 30:46.871
Just kidding.

30:50.619 --> 30:55.184
Let us take care of you. No, nope, no.
Wrong move. There you go, there you go.

30:55.264 --> 30:56.485
There you go.

30:56.565 --> 30:59.355
Lay down, baby. Just lay down. Lay down.

30:59.435 --> 31:03.025
Excuse me. Have some respect.
You're at our house, you're in our bed.

31:03.105 --> 31:05.761
Fucking lay down. How about that?

31:07.021 --> 31:09.798
There it is. Oh, she loves that.

31:09.878 --> 31:12.683
Kappa Phi! Kappa Phi!

31:12.763 --> 31:17.165
Kappa Phi! Kappa Phi! Kappa Phi!

31:42.611 --> 31:45.067
This is really nice.

31:45.447 --> 31:47.638
Yeah, I kind of needed it.

31:49.218 --> 31:50.313
Lindsey?

31:51.234 --> 31:53.447
Yeah. Bye, guys.

31:54.224 --> 31:56.065
Can I help you?

31:56.926 --> 32:00.617
I'm Noelle. I'm an...
I'm an art student at BU.

32:01.497 --> 32:03.419
I'm sorry to just show up like this.

32:03.499 --> 32:07.022
I just want to tell you that your
story has really inspired me.

32:07.102 --> 32:09.386
I'm sorry. I've got to go.

32:13.107 --> 32:15.374
I just need a couple minutes.

32:15.454 --> 32:18.234
I'm working on my thesis.
It's about the brutality of...

32:18.314 --> 32:22.419
Good luck with your project,
but please just leave me alone.

32:23.419 --> 32:26.595
- Wait.
- Look, you don't know me, okay?

32:27.055 --> 32:30.949
You don't know anything about me. I don't
want to be the subject of your project.

32:31.029 --> 32:32.835
You're not the subject.

32:33.695 --> 32:35.319
They are.

32:38.666 --> 32:41.156
Your thesis is about my rapists?

32:41.236 --> 32:44.456
Not just yours. Mine, too.

32:47.508 --> 32:50.733
If I could go back,
I would've kept my mouth shut.

32:50.813 --> 32:54.036
I could have done without people
calling me a liar.

32:54.116 --> 32:56.939
Especially people I thought were my friends.

32:57.019 --> 32:58.869
Even girls?

32:59.687 --> 33:01.509
Oh, yeah.

33:01.589 --> 33:04.642
Girls hate sluts.

33:07.228 --> 33:10.386
I didn't know that I was going
to be the one on trial.

33:10.466 --> 33:13.259
"How many people have you had sex with?

33:13.339 --> 33:15.024
"Were you flirting?

33:15.104 --> 33:17.442
- Did you have an orgasm?"
- An orgasm?

33:17.522 --> 33:19.561
Oh, yeah, it was really enjoyable.

33:19.641 --> 33:24.099
Especially the part where I woke up
bleeding, not knowing what happened...

33:24.179 --> 33:26.801
...staples on the back of my head.

33:26.881 --> 33:28.371
You did the right thing.

33:29.551 --> 33:31.135
Did I?

33:34.489 --> 33:37.746
They're fine. They're more than fine.

33:37.826 --> 33:41.347
They are throwing a huge rager on Friday.

33:41.897 --> 33:46.322
And I got the text. It's funny.
I'm still on their contact list.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.874
I'm sorry, Lindsey.

33:54.859 --> 33:57.742
You know, I might not be able to have babies?

34:02.450 --> 34:04.737
I don't even know if I wanted babies.

34:32.330 --> 34:34.197
Have some respect.

34:35.850 --> 34:37.228
Kappa Phi!

34:57.738 --> 35:00.161
I didn't even believe that even happened.

35:03.878 --> 35:06.135
- I was there all night.
- Oh, my gosh, really?

35:06.215 --> 35:08.938
Yeah, I was with Conor and his friends.

35:09.018 --> 35:12.975
Hi, I'm Jenna. I'm the president
of V-Day Balboa. What's your name?

35:13.055 --> 35:15.273
- Noelle.
- Come here.

35:16.414 --> 35:18.614
So I spoke to mark at the Gazette...

35:18.694 --> 35:22.779
...and they're going to place our
Rio article in next week's issue.

35:25.299 --> 35:26.640
What article?

35:26.720 --> 35:29.104
There's a case of a 16-year-old girl
in Rio de Janeiro.

35:29.184 --> 35:33.362
She was drugged and raped by 33 men,
and her video is posted all on social media.

35:33.442 --> 35:35.065
That's so awful.

35:35.145 --> 35:38.100
So, we still need a name
for our fall awareness event.

35:38.180 --> 35:41.670
They posted a video,
like the three football players...

35:41.750 --> 35:45.941
...that raped a girl last year?
The fraternity brothers, the Ki Phis.

35:46.021 --> 35:48.710
Yeah. Lindsey Shaw.

35:48.790 --> 35:51.246
They got off, and she went off the deep end.

35:51.326 --> 35:54.950
Do you know how they got off?
I mean, there's a video proof.

35:55.030 --> 35:57.052
Yeah, but you couldn't
really see their faces.

35:57.132 --> 36:00.122
They said she was a freak, into gang bangs.

36:00.202 --> 36:02.691
It became a classic
he said/she said situation.

36:02.771 --> 36:04.973
Well, that's like Daisy,
remember freshman year?

36:05.053 --> 36:08.197
Yeah, she got raped by her ex-boyfriend.
He was on the basketball team.

36:08.277 --> 36:11.643
Yeah, I had classes with him.
And he beat her, too. Like, bad.

36:11.723 --> 36:14.321
And you know what the school did?
They put him on probation...

36:14.401 --> 36:17.739
...for probably like a week. I don't
even think he missed any of his games.

36:17.819 --> 36:21.410
He graduates right on time. Nothing happened.
It was just a little blip in the time line.

36:21.490 --> 36:23.492
- I can't believe that.
- That's sick.

36:23.572 --> 36:25.981
- Heroes for Rio.
- That's perfect.

36:26.061 --> 36:29.413
Hashtag... rioheroes, like, "real heroes."

36:31.265 --> 36:33.922
Okay, guys, check it out. So, you know
that nail polish, it changes color...

36:34.002 --> 36:36.825
...if there's a date rape drug in it?
You put it on, you swirl it around...

36:36.905 --> 36:40.695
...it'll change colors? Right?
We totally need that on campus.

36:40.775 --> 36:43.549
We should urge the school
to provide it for incoming freshman.

36:43.629 --> 36:46.135
Or guys could just stop
drugging and raping girls...

36:46.215 --> 36:48.684
...so we don't need
color-changing nail polish.

36:50.518 --> 36:53.408
That would be nice,
but until that day comes...

36:53.488 --> 36:55.657
...I think we need to be prepared.

36:55.737 --> 36:57.762
What if we're not prepared?

36:59.394 --> 37:00.807
What if we have a drink?

37:00.887 --> 37:05.330
What if we wear high heels
and we didn't learn Taekwondo?

37:06.468 --> 37:09.992
What if we forgot our rape whistle at home
and we didn't paint our nails...

37:10.072 --> 37:14.953
...with color-changing nail polish
that tells you if your drink is drugged?

37:15.644 --> 37:17.499
Then what?

37:18.279 --> 37:20.170
We just get raped?

37:22.150 --> 37:26.642
How about instead of that
really useful fashion advice...

37:26.722 --> 37:29.378
...the administration starts teaching guys...

37:29.458 --> 37:32.681
...that they can't stick their dicks
wherever they want?

37:32.761 --> 37:35.451
Some people are going to be violent
no matter what they are taught.

37:35.531 --> 37:37.886
We've got to do our best
to protect ourselves.

37:38.666 --> 37:41.857
- With hashtag... rioheroes?
- At least we're spreading awareness...

37:41.937 --> 37:44.626
...and we're actually doing something.

37:51.179 --> 37:53.435
You're right. I'm sorry.

37:54.815 --> 37:56.505
You're right.

37:56.585 --> 38:00.576
Okay. Let's talk about
the beauty drive for next week.

38:00.656 --> 38:05.107
I'll bring a box to the meeting and we can
collect some gently used beauty products.

38:33.721 --> 38:35.232
Hi.

39:42.256 --> 39:44.074
What's up?

39:45.059 --> 39:46.582
Hi.

39:47.862 --> 39:49.711
You here all by yourself?

39:51.966 --> 39:53.835
Not anymore.

40:23.797 --> 40:25.330
Fuck.

40:25.410 --> 40:27.678
You trying to take advantage of me?

40:29.730 --> 40:31.555
Yes, I am.

40:34.274 --> 40:36.144
Careful when you suck.

40:38.379 --> 40:41.599
Yeah. Shit.

40:43.317 --> 40:45.336
Oh, fuck.

40:51.459 --> 40:53.314
What's your name?

40:54.094 --> 40:56.540
How about we get another drink.

40:58.899 --> 41:00.719
Fucking crazy.

41:07.341 --> 41:10.006
You're so fucking sexy.

41:11.582 --> 41:14.799
- Is that for me?
- Here, drink it.

41:25.826 --> 41:27.649
I know you want it.

41:27.729 --> 41:29.612
I know you want it.

41:30.964 --> 41:33.216
It's okay. It's okay.

41:33.301 --> 41:35.190
Hold on.

41:35.470 --> 41:38.660
Hold on. I need... I need... water.

41:38.940 --> 41:42.964
- I need some water. Hold on.
- Are you okay?

41:43.044 --> 41:45.901
- I just need a little water.
- Water, water, water.

41:45.981 --> 41:48.875
- I just... I just need some water.
- Here.

41:49.351 --> 41:51.079
Is this water?

41:51.159 --> 41:53.250
Just kidding.

41:56.390 --> 42:00.761
There you go. There you go.
Just lay down, baby. Just lay down.

42:01.199 --> 42:02.985
I know you like it.

42:03.065 --> 42:04.619
She loves that, dude.

42:04.699 --> 42:07.150
Get her, get her, get her, get her.

42:23.884 --> 42:25.740
You're welcome.

45:05.880 --> 45:07.769
Morning, sunshine.

45:08.449 --> 45:09.671
Good morning.

45:09.751 --> 45:13.170
Seems like you're in a good mood. Meet a boy?

45:14.121 --> 45:15.810
Something like that.

45:16.890 --> 45:19.777
Attagirl. Peas and carrots.

45:33.741 --> 45:37.898
Cause of death is asphyxiation
due to aspiration of his own vomit.

45:40.414 --> 45:43.701
He's one of the football players
from that rape case last spring.

45:53.957 --> 45:55.812
Was he suicidal?

45:58.832 --> 46:00.351
No.

46:02.435 --> 46:04.960
Look, man, he was going through some shit.

46:07.808 --> 46:10.131
Man, the press is basically
canonizing this kid.

46:10.211 --> 46:12.827
- Bullshit.
- I'm surprised that house is still standing.

46:12.907 --> 46:15.503
Date-rape accusations, the president
drinking himself to death, right?

46:15.583 --> 46:18.205
Yeah, yeah. That's what it looks like.

46:18.285 --> 46:20.041
And?

46:20.121 --> 46:22.727
I don't know. It didn't feel right.

46:24.958 --> 46:28.116
- Are you going to tell us anything?
- You'll find out when you need to know.

46:28.196 --> 46:31.247
- You're a fucking tease.
- Just on Mondays.

46:31.765 --> 46:33.385
Let me see that.

46:46.246 --> 46:49.104
Well? What do you think?

46:49.284 --> 46:53.508
I love the multiple hands.
It's very suggestive.

46:53.588 --> 46:57.212
Very haunting, but in a beautiful way.

46:57.292 --> 47:00.708
The richness of the black,
there's so much depth to it.

47:01.095 --> 47:03.695
- Shane?
- It's...

47:03.775 --> 47:07.587
...it's sensual and tormented...

47:07.667 --> 47:10.353
...sad, beautiful.

47:11.072 --> 47:14.456
Well... who are you...

47:15.076 --> 47:17.727
...and what have you done with Noelle?

47:18.245 --> 47:20.069
Keep going.

47:20.549 --> 47:22.797
Oh, shit.

47:58.486 --> 48:00.037
Yeah?

48:07.795 --> 48:09.814
Can I help you?

48:15.135 --> 48:17.421
I've got a surprise for you.

48:22.376 --> 48:24.195
Close your eyes.

48:27.300 --> 48:29.139
Oh, yeah.

48:59.246 --> 49:01.005
Surprise.

49:06.620 --> 49:09.477
Oh, bro, bro, you can't just
walk in here like that.

49:09.557 --> 49:11.893
Are Jeremiah and Conor home?

49:20.267 --> 49:23.654
- Oh, guys...
- Oh, shit!

51:49.282 --> 51:51.673
Earlier today,
Balboa University chancellor...

51:51.753 --> 51:55.973
Blunt force trauma to the right posterior
skull, causing craniocerebral injury.

51:59.883 --> 52:04.839
Police are not revealing the cause of death,
citing the ongoing investigation.

52:04.919 --> 52:07.478
- I'm sorry.
- How long did you know Jeremiah?

52:07.558 --> 52:10.591
I remember him going upstairs
with a girl with a mask on.

52:10.671 --> 52:12.823
- She had a wig on her head.
- It was pink.

52:12.903 --> 52:15.650
Immediate loss of consciousness
resulted in a secondary injury...

52:15.730 --> 52:19.297
- ...to the upper jaw and loss of blood.
- Police are asking the public to...

52:19.447 --> 52:22.240
How about Conor? How many years
did you know Conor for?

52:22.320 --> 52:26.378
Same amount of time? When was
the last time that you'd seen Jeremiah?

52:50.610 --> 52:53.835
Hi. Lindsey Shaw? Detective Cavanaugh.
I just want to ask you a few questions.

52:53.915 --> 52:56.020
- Do you have a minute?
- About what?

52:56.100 --> 52:58.181
Jeremiah Marks and Conor McKinley.

53:00.820 --> 53:03.044
- Am I a suspect?
- I'm not saying that.

53:03.124 --> 53:06.426
- Are we done?
- Look, I'd just appreciate your help.

53:09.162 --> 53:13.033
Like you want a tip from the poor girl
who couldn't prove her rape? Okay.

53:13.868 --> 53:17.708
For every one of me, Detective, I'm guessing
there are a few who never even tried...

53:17.788 --> 53:19.256
...rightfully.

53:20.174 --> 53:22.236
Why don't you start there?

53:27.981 --> 53:32.026
- It's so crazy.
- Well, I, for one, am all for it, so...

53:32.106 --> 53:34.108
Maybe now guys will think twice.

53:34.188 --> 53:37.365
Does murdering a rapist
really help heal the survivor?

53:37.825 --> 53:40.314
I don't know, but do we really
want rapists on the streets?

53:40.394 --> 53:43.217
Jenna, you know that most rapes
are repeat offenders, right?

53:43.297 --> 53:46.687
We're here to support survivors,
not to celebrate serial killers.

53:46.767 --> 53:49.057
I thought we were here to create change.

53:49.137 --> 53:51.325
There are other ways to create change.

53:51.405 --> 53:53.794
Like what? Writing letters to congress?

53:53.874 --> 53:57.565
Sure. Whatever it takes short
of murdering someone.

53:57.645 --> 53:59.534
But that's just me.

53:59.614 --> 54:02.350
Yeah, I think it is just you.

54:02.850 --> 54:06.244
You ever heard the saying, "an eye for
an eye leaves the whole world blind?"

54:08.888 --> 54:10.707
The world's already blind.

54:13.480 --> 54:17.818
Due to the tragic incidents of this
past week, a curfew is now in effect.

54:17.898 --> 54:20.251
Please return to your dormitories.

54:25.004 --> 54:27.489
- Hey, Noelle.
- Hey.

54:31.478 --> 54:33.768
- Hot.
- Is it?

54:34.448 --> 54:37.118
Yeah, it's really hot. Be careful.

54:37.198 --> 54:39.057
It's not that hot.

54:39.987 --> 54:42.810
- I'm really sensitive.
- To heat?

54:42.890 --> 54:45.034
To hot pizza.

54:50.367 --> 54:53.271
Is that... is that how you eat pizza?

54:53.351 --> 54:56.155
- No, yeah. This is the way the Italians do it.
- Pretty sure it's not.

54:56.235 --> 54:58.693
No, no. You see, girl, 'cause I'm Italian...

54:58.973 --> 55:01.198
...I know my culture,
and this is the way we do it.

55:01.278 --> 55:03.297
You're not Italian.

55:03.377 --> 55:07.034
Have you not seen me?
You can't tell by my face?

55:07.514 --> 55:10.338
You got a little... just a little something.

55:10.718 --> 55:13.241
Yeah. Yeah. A little... little higher.

55:13.321 --> 55:17.093
No, a little bit on the other...
the other side. A little lower.

55:17.173 --> 55:19.948
- There you go.
- Shane.

55:20.828 --> 55:23.283
It was disgusting. It was gigantic.

55:24.363 --> 55:26.187
What's that?

55:26.267 --> 55:28.699
- What?
- Was that a snort?

55:30.837 --> 55:32.777
- No, it wasn't.
- That was a snort.

55:32.857 --> 55:35.129
- It was not a snort.
- I'm not making fun of you.

55:35.209 --> 55:37.816
I'm not making fun of your piggish laugh.

55:38.546 --> 55:43.542
I mean, you're, like, the only girl
I've known that could make a snort sexy.

56:27.027 --> 56:30.039
- Really?
- Yeah.

56:52.820 --> 56:54.475
Did I...

56:54.555 --> 56:56.272
Get out.

57:00.327 --> 57:03.128
- Are you okay?
- Get out.

57:03.997 --> 57:06.782
Okay. Okay.

57:42.769 --> 57:44.275
Skye?

57:55.214 --> 57:57.104
Hey, Skye.

57:57.384 --> 57:58.739
Don't come in here right now.

57:58.819 --> 58:00.641
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

58:00.721 --> 58:04.145
- Oh, my God.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

58:04.225 --> 58:05.601
Nothing.

58:06.494 --> 58:08.043
Skye.

58:10.430 --> 58:12.316
Please don't look.

58:16.402 --> 58:17.954
Stop.

58:21.874 --> 58:23.727
It's okay.

58:25.244 --> 58:27.704
You know my name's actually Daisy?

58:28.469 --> 58:32.458
Something happened, and I... I changed it.

58:37.123 --> 58:38.943
Do you want to talk about it?

58:41.394 --> 58:45.020
Do you ever think back
at a different time in your life...

58:46.966 --> 58:51.422
...and a different person you used to be...

58:53.506 --> 58:55.255
...and just think...

58:57.276 --> 58:59.931
"I wish I could be here again"?

59:03.850 --> 59:05.714
I get that.

59:25.838 --> 59:27.389
Elle?

59:28.508 --> 59:30.810
Will you sleep with me tonight?

59:31.378 --> 59:32.896
Yeah.

01:00:53.119 --> 01:00:54.635
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:00:54.715 --> 01:00:55.958
How can I help you?

01:00:56.038 --> 01:01:00.454
Do you know what sort of crime
reports the public has access to?

01:01:00.534 --> 01:01:02.345
On-campus crime?

01:01:07.674 --> 01:01:11.465
They release these every year...
Clery statistics.

01:01:11.545 --> 01:01:13.797
Clery statistics.

01:01:32.699 --> 01:01:33.983
All set?

01:01:35.001 --> 01:01:38.488
What if I wanted a more detailed report?

01:01:42.241 --> 01:01:46.367
I'm not really supposed to let
anyone back here, but here it is.

01:01:46.447 --> 01:01:48.569
- Wow.
- Yeah, I guess.

01:01:48.649 --> 01:01:50.872
Just a bunch of boxes.

01:01:51.352 --> 01:01:55.843
So criminal justice? What do you think
you're going to do when you graduate?

01:01:55.923 --> 01:01:58.111
- I don't know.
- Cool.

01:01:58.191 --> 01:02:00.481
You probably actually shouldn't
really look in the files.

01:02:00.561 --> 01:02:02.457
Just a peek?

01:02:03.462 --> 01:02:06.297
All right. Just a peek, though.

01:02:10.836 --> 01:02:14.194
So where do you live on campus?
Somewhere close, or...

01:02:14.274 --> 01:02:17.765
- Kind of.
- Yeah, I'm just actually down the street.

01:02:17.845 --> 01:02:20.958
I really like this area. It's got a lot
of bars and stuff that you can go to...

01:02:21.038 --> 01:02:23.037
...which is cool. Those are just kind of...

01:02:23.117 --> 01:02:26.440
- Why do you have files from 2003?
- That's just the same thing. Hey.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.344
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- No, no, it's okay. You know what?

01:02:29.424 --> 01:02:32.379
- I better do it. No, no, no, no, no.
- I got it.

01:02:32.459 --> 01:02:35.215
- Can you let me just...
- Yeah, yeah, I'll let you do it.

01:02:35.295 --> 01:02:38.819
Thanks. It's just they go in a certain
order. It's okay. It's totally...

01:02:38.899 --> 01:02:40.718
...it's totally cool.

01:02:45.037 --> 01:02:48.907
All right, well, I think
the tour is done for the day.

01:03:02.588 --> 01:03:04.148
Hello?

01:03:07.026 --> 01:03:08.616
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:03:08.696 --> 01:03:11.319
Sorry. Did I freak you out?

01:03:11.999 --> 01:03:14.388
Hi, cutie. I brought your mail.

01:03:14.468 --> 01:03:17.691
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:03:17.771 --> 01:03:19.640
How was home?

01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:24.413
Well, my parents are out of their
goddamn minds. What else is new?

01:03:27.714 --> 01:03:29.532
You okay?

01:03:31.183 --> 01:03:33.874
I'm going to go out tonight.
You want to come?

01:03:33.954 --> 01:03:37.174
- I'm going to stay in.
- Okay. I'll see you later.

01:03:38.891 --> 01:03:40.410
Skye.

01:03:42.762 --> 01:03:44.614
I'm here for you.

01:03:46.232 --> 01:03:48.055
I know you are.

01:03:48.435 --> 01:03:49.985
Love you.

01:04:19.198 --> 01:04:21.077
"Melinda Sanders."

01:04:28.708 --> 01:04:30.664
Excuse me. Did we have...

01:04:30.744 --> 01:04:33.985
Zero rapes in the Clery statistics.

01:04:35.047 --> 01:04:36.270
I'm sorry?

01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:40.437
Is someone paying you off,
Melinda Gabriel Sanders?

01:04:46.258 --> 01:04:48.939
Why don't you have a seat
and we can talk about your issue?

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:50.851
My issue?

01:04:51.231 --> 01:04:53.620
You love that. Let me guess.

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:57.157
Next you're going to diagnose me
with borderline personality disorder...

01:04:57.237 --> 01:05:00.250
...doctor speak for "I'm fucking crazy"?

01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:02.542
You really need to watch
the way you're speaking to me.

01:05:02.622 --> 01:05:05.408
No, you need to watch
the way you speak to me.

01:05:14.854 --> 01:05:16.580
I'm getting...

01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:20.694
...that you're angry with me
about how I handled something...

01:05:20.774 --> 01:05:24.402
...but threatening me is not
going to give you what you want.

01:05:25.432 --> 01:05:29.690
You probably drive home every day all proud
of yourself for saving the world again...

01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:34.199
...but let me take a moment
to advise you, Melinda.

01:05:34.279 --> 01:05:37.765
Be better at your job, at life,
or do us all a favor...

01:05:37.845 --> 01:05:41.126
...and I don't mean this hypothetically,
remove yourself from here...

01:05:41.206 --> 01:05:44.384
...from everywhere, or I will do it for you.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.681
Nice shoes, by the way.

01:06:16.816 --> 01:06:19.139
"Calvin Reeves."

01:07:16.475 --> 01:07:19.366
Oh, wait. Don't forget your keys. Here.

01:07:20.208 --> 01:07:22.297
- Bye.
- You know it.

01:07:59.251 --> 01:08:01.875
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:08:02.255 --> 01:08:04.377
I'm so sorry to do this.

01:08:04.457 --> 01:08:07.681
I just got a flat tire,
and I've never had one before.

01:08:07.761 --> 01:08:12.899
I know I have a spare but I just
don't know exactly how to...

01:08:12.979 --> 01:08:14.554
...change it.

01:08:14.634 --> 01:08:17.491
Do you think you could help me? I'm so sorry.

01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:20.394
- Where's your car?
- It's right here.

01:08:20.474 --> 01:08:22.496
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you so much.

01:08:22.576 --> 01:08:24.426
No, it's fine.

01:08:31.450 --> 01:08:33.307
How'd you do it?

01:08:33.886 --> 01:08:36.337
Just, you know, driving.

01:08:37.389 --> 01:08:39.549
Did the same thing a couple months ago.
Where's the spare?

01:08:39.629 --> 01:08:42.278
It's... it's in the trunk.

01:09:15.995 --> 01:09:18.272
It's an art installation.

01:09:24.937 --> 01:09:28.432
So, basically, on these patrols,
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary.

01:09:28.511 --> 01:09:32.099
You know... you know, people standing
around that don't look like they're students.

01:09:32.179 --> 01:09:34.433
Checking the bushes.

01:09:34.513 --> 01:09:37.404
You know, vagrants, which are
homeless people, obviously.

01:09:37.484 --> 01:09:39.421
- Yeah.
- Thefts.

01:09:39.501 --> 01:09:42.509
Then of, course, any violence that may occur.

01:09:43.488 --> 01:09:48.029
And then, you know, more recently,
that has meant murder.

01:09:49.261 --> 01:09:51.948
This doesn't bring back your glory days?

01:09:56.619 --> 01:09:59.095
I hear you were quite the point guard.

01:10:05.143 --> 01:10:07.211
You were real proud of that.

01:10:08.897 --> 01:10:10.941
I'm just fucking with you.

01:10:16.922 --> 01:10:18.969
Nice handiwork, by the way.

01:10:28.934 --> 01:10:31.073
Is that blood? Right there.

01:10:32.171 --> 01:10:34.452
Don't move. Stay right there.

01:10:34.891 --> 01:10:37.143
Jimmy, this is Dave, over.

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.083
Jimmy here, go ahead.

01:10:40.663 --> 01:10:44.688
We have what appears to be human blood
outside the west entrance of the gymnasium.

01:10:44.768 --> 01:10:46.475
Send backup, over.

01:10:48.187 --> 01:10:49.803
What?

01:10:49.883 --> 01:10:51.919
Do you want to talk about it?

01:11:01.734 --> 01:11:03.290
Please...

01:11:04.194 --> 01:11:05.996
...don't hurt me.

01:11:06.705 --> 01:11:08.796
I know what I did.

01:11:09.076 --> 01:11:11.698
I'm sorry for what I did.

01:11:11.778 --> 01:11:14.067
I'm so sorry.

01:11:14.817 --> 01:11:15.996
God.

01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:19.088
Please.

01:11:20.486 --> 01:11:22.076
Please.

01:11:22.656 --> 01:11:24.240
Please!

01:11:25.941 --> 01:11:27.960
I'm a good guy.

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:34.250
I'm changed. Please.

01:11:39.805 --> 01:11:41.890
Okay, calm down.

01:11:45.937 --> 01:11:48.315
- Help! Help me!
- Shit.

01:11:48.395 --> 01:11:50.852
- Shut the fuck up.
- Help! Help!

01:11:57.723 --> 01:11:59.208
Police!

01:12:06.432 --> 01:12:08.245
I'll check the kid.

01:12:39.898 --> 01:12:41.455
Hey.

01:12:41.635 --> 01:12:44.664
- Elle. Elle, are you bleeding?
- No, it's paint.

01:12:44.744 --> 01:12:47.189
- What is this?
- It's paint!

01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:53.486
Daisy.

01:13:53.566 --> 01:13:56.996
- Detective Kennedy.
- I don't go by Daisy. It's Skye.

01:13:57.076 --> 01:14:01.161
Okay, Skye. Is there... is there
someplace we can speak privately?

01:14:01.241 --> 01:14:04.321
- I'm sorry, what is this about?
- Calvin Reeves.

01:14:07.085 --> 01:14:10.417
I'm actually... I can't answer any
questions without my lawyer present.

01:14:10.497 --> 01:14:13.713
So if you want to talk to me,
you can contact her directly.

01:14:13.793 --> 01:14:16.966
Calvin was attacked. He's in the ICU.

01:14:21.467 --> 01:14:23.013
Good.

01:14:47.226 --> 01:14:49.039
That's very interesting.

01:14:51.096 --> 01:14:52.493
So...

01:14:53.295 --> 01:14:55.144
...I've got some news.

01:14:58.269 --> 01:15:00.329
I talked to the department...

01:15:00.957 --> 01:15:02.499
...and...

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:05.521
...we'd like you to speak at graduation.

01:15:08.214 --> 01:15:11.137
- Are you serious?
- Pretty fucking serious.

01:15:11.217 --> 01:15:13.540
- What do you say?
- Yes.

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:15.935
- Excellent.
- Thank you.

01:15:16.015 --> 01:15:17.873
You deserve it.

01:15:19.224 --> 01:15:21.049
Back to work.

01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:53.138
Oh, my God.

01:16:53.218 --> 01:16:54.773
Skye?

01:16:57.623 --> 01:16:59.632
Where did you get this?

01:17:05.764 --> 01:17:07.783
Where did you get it, Noelle?

01:17:10.402 --> 01:17:12.490
A cop questioned me today.

01:17:14.272 --> 01:17:16.158
Where were you last night?

01:17:19.778 --> 01:17:21.631
Where the fuck were you?

01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:26.975
- I was working.
- Don't lie to me.

01:17:30.589 --> 01:17:32.597
What did you do, Elle?

01:17:37.212 --> 01:17:40.050
Noelle, what did you do?

01:17:42.835 --> 01:17:44.467
He hurt you.

01:17:45.387 --> 01:17:48.094
- What?
- And then he went back to school...

01:17:48.174 --> 01:17:50.517
...back to graduation,
like it never happened.

01:17:50.597 --> 01:17:54.567
- No, no, no, no, no, Noelle.
- You know what they did?

01:17:54.647 --> 01:17:58.883
They put you in the back
of a fucking room to gather dust...

01:17:58.963 --> 01:18:01.508
- ...like it never fucking happened.
- That is what I want.

01:18:01.588 --> 01:18:05.241
- After everything he did to you?
- Yes. Why would you do this?

01:18:08.794 --> 01:18:11.384
I couldn't let him get away with it.

01:18:11.464 --> 01:18:15.875
- It's not your responsibility.
- Whose responsibility is it, then?

01:18:15.955 --> 01:18:20.827
The cops? The school?
They are not protecting us, Skye.

01:18:21.707 --> 01:18:24.731
- But I will.
- You're not protecting me.

01:18:24.811 --> 01:18:27.700
That cop has been following me,
he wants to ask me questions.

01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:29.021
Calvin is in the ICU.

01:18:29.101 --> 01:18:30.931
- He's going to tell them.
- What?

01:18:31.011 --> 01:18:32.552
- He's going to tell them.
- No.

01:18:32.632 --> 01:18:35.642
He's going to tell them
and they're going to come for me.

01:18:35.722 --> 01:18:37.978
How could you be so stupid?

01:18:38.888 --> 01:18:41.200
All I have ever wanted...

01:18:41.707 --> 01:18:45.771
...was this to be over, and now it's back...

01:18:46.551 --> 01:18:48.378
...because of you.

01:18:51.269 --> 01:18:53.101
Because of you.

01:18:54.306 --> 01:18:57.864
Why would you do this? Oh, my God,
I'm going to have to go back to that.

01:18:57.944 --> 01:19:00.774
I'm going to have to prove
that I'm not crazy, that I didn't...

01:19:00.854 --> 01:19:03.930
...I didn't do anything. I didn't want this.

01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:07.301
I'll tell them. I'll tell them what I did.

01:19:07.653 --> 01:19:11.102
He's not going to follow you anymore.
No one's going to come after you.

01:19:11.182 --> 01:19:15.185
First thing in the morning I'm going to go
to the station, and I'll turn myself in.

01:19:19.197 --> 01:19:21.069
I'm sorry.

01:19:23.101 --> 01:19:24.988
I'm so sorry.

01:19:29.842 --> 01:19:31.952
I love you.

01:19:51.930 --> 01:19:53.782
Hey, Skye.

01:20:23.328 --> 01:20:25.004
Help!

01:20:25.084 --> 01:20:28.327
No. No.

01:20:28.634 --> 01:20:29.711
Skye.

01:20:32.187 --> 01:20:33.749
No!

01:20:35.874 --> 01:20:37.393
No!

01:20:40.312 --> 01:20:42.297
I'm sorry.

01:20:44.282 --> 01:20:45.803
Skye.

01:20:47.652 --> 01:20:49.173
No!

01:20:50.806 --> 01:20:52.250
Help!

01:20:54.759 --> 01:20:57.381
Skye, please don't leave.

01:21:00.431 --> 01:21:03.118
Please, please.

01:21:22.754 --> 01:21:24.611
Yeah, no dice.

01:21:25.191 --> 01:21:27.041
Keep looking.

01:21:32.698 --> 01:21:35.555
You knew that Skye accused Calvin of rape.

01:21:35.935 --> 01:21:40.027
I know that she accused him of rape
because he raped her.

01:21:41.007 --> 01:21:43.496
You know, no offense,
Detective, but this case...

01:21:43.576 --> 01:21:48.435
...the search for the rapist slayer
might be a waste of your expertise.

01:21:49.415 --> 01:21:52.159
- How do you figure?
- Well...

01:21:52.239 --> 01:21:55.775
...I didn't know any of the victims
personally, but from what I hear...

01:21:55.855 --> 01:21:59.075
...they didn't really sound
like stand-up guys.

01:22:00.859 --> 01:22:03.883
Good guys, bad guys, short, tall...

01:22:03.963 --> 01:22:08.057
...you break the law,
there's going to be consequences.

01:22:08.137 --> 01:22:10.969
I guess it depends on which law you break.

01:22:29.221 --> 01:22:33.422
Do you know why your friend Skye
would want to take her own life?

01:22:42.133 --> 01:22:45.153
Can't keep running
from your demons, now can you?

01:22:57.833 --> 01:22:59.351
Hey.

01:23:03.014 --> 01:23:04.530
Hi.

01:23:05.924 --> 01:23:08.581
I'm really sorry that I didn't
text you back. I've been...

01:23:08.661 --> 01:23:10.512
Don't worry about it.

01:23:14.265 --> 01:23:16.256
I'm sorry about your neighbor.

01:23:17.136 --> 01:23:18.953
Thank you.

01:23:20.538 --> 01:23:22.357
I've got to go.

01:23:53.905 --> 01:23:55.586
Thank you all for being here...

01:23:56.296 --> 01:24:00.264
...for the unveiling of the 2016...

01:24:00.344 --> 01:24:03.015
...visual arts thesis exhibition.

01:24:03.415 --> 01:24:05.265
Enjoy yourselves.

01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:20.386
Thank you so much.

01:24:21.466 --> 01:24:24.648
- Hey, how are you? Thanks.
- You did really good.

01:24:24.728 --> 01:24:26.873
- Thank you. So did you.
- Thank you.

01:24:27.273 --> 01:24:30.091
Kind of retreating in isolation.

01:25:20.575 --> 01:25:22.852
Hello, everyone. Hello.

01:25:23.062 --> 01:25:26.419
Thank you for coming out
to celebrate this journey...

01:25:26.499 --> 01:25:29.155
...that is culminating into today...

01:25:29.235 --> 01:25:31.524
...for these fine young people.

01:25:31.604 --> 01:25:36.226
The MFA visual arts class of 2016.

01:25:40.111 --> 01:25:44.517
It is my great pleasure
to introduce you to...

01:25:44.597 --> 01:25:49.626
...a student who has gone
on no less than a transformation...

01:25:50.756 --> 01:25:52.812
...these last few years.

01:25:52.892 --> 01:25:55.766
Soon to be master of fine arts...

01:25:56.408 --> 01:25:58.055
...Noelle Posero.

01:26:05.837 --> 01:26:07.689
Knock them dead.

01:26:14.946 --> 01:26:17.186
Why art?

01:26:19.183 --> 01:26:22.608
One of my earliest memories,
I was painting a sunflower...

01:26:22.688 --> 01:26:26.712
...with my watercolors,
and somewhere in my little-kid brain...

01:26:26.792 --> 01:26:29.882
I knew that this perfect sunflower...

01:26:29.962 --> 01:26:33.475
...would shrivel up and die one day.

01:26:34.533 --> 01:26:37.954
But I had the power to preserve it...

01:26:38.034 --> 01:26:41.857
...to immortalize the beauty around me...

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:49.008
...to save it from the brutality of life.

01:26:49.815 --> 01:26:53.345
Leonardo da Vinci said,
"every painter should begin...

01:26:53.425 --> 01:26:56.105
...with a wash of black on their canvas...

01:26:56.785 --> 01:27:00.079
...because everything in nature is dark...

01:27:00.159 --> 01:27:03.316
...except for where it's exposed by light."

01:27:03.896 --> 01:27:07.104
Perhaps we are conditioned
to begin on a white canvas.

01:27:10.336 --> 01:27:14.942
But maybe what we need right now
is to see the water turning murky...

01:27:15.558 --> 01:27:18.001
...to see the petals falling.

01:27:18.081 --> 01:27:22.234
Maybe it's through art that we come
face to face with our own darkness...

01:27:22.314 --> 01:27:24.958
...and that's the only way we can change.

01:27:29.086 --> 01:27:32.913
MFA class of 2016, I urge you...

01:27:34.493 --> 01:27:36.844
...aim not to preserve the beauty...

01:27:36.924 --> 01:27:39.138
...but to expose the truth.

01:27:43.615 --> 01:27:46.313
Dare to make the world uncomfortable...

01:27:46.393 --> 01:27:49.795
...with your honesty no matter
what the consequence is...

01:27:50.075 --> 01:27:52.638
...because the world will be better for it.

01:27:53.279 --> 01:27:55.336
You will be better for it.

01:27:57.316 --> 01:27:59.200
Thank you.

01:28:05.223 --> 01:28:07.041
Thank you.

01:28:09.527 --> 01:28:12.751
On behalf of Balboa University...

01:28:12.831 --> 01:28:17.456
...congratulations to the master
of fine arts class 2016.

01:28:17.536 --> 01:28:20.940
You may now move your tassel
from the right side of your cap...

01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:24.669
- ...to the left. Congratulations.
- Noelle. Noelle. Hey, where you going?

01:28:24.749 --> 01:28:26.594
This is it.

01:28:33.919 --> 01:28:35.606
Congrats.

01:29:01.879 --> 01:29:05.081
Stop right there. Stop. Turn around.

01:29:06.651 --> 01:29:10.541
Stop. Do not move.
Drop whatever's in your left hand.

01:29:11.190 --> 01:29:13.246
Drop whatever's in your right hand.

01:29:13.926 --> 01:29:15.948
Put your hands behind your back.

01:29:16.528 --> 01:29:18.111
Covering.
