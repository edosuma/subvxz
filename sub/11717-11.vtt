Danny, she's not just a victim,

07:01.990 --> 07:04.057

clip her husband,
maybe she had an accomplice.

10:36.147 --> 10:39.116
I don't know anything
about a Pagoda Hotel.

10:39.184 --> 10:41.285
I certainly didn't make
any calls to it.

10:41.353 --> 10:43.420
Okay, so how do you explain
the five calls

10:43.488 --> 10:45.789
from your cell phone to
the front desk there yesterday?

10:46.221 --> 10:48.322
I don't know.

10:49.958 --> 10:52.326
Maybe Jake borrowed my phone.

10:52.394 --> 10:55.429
He forget to bring
his cell charger.

10:55.497 --> 10:58.032
Yeah, from what we hear,
you had to pack in a hurry.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.504
You spoke to Jake's mother.

11:03.571 --> 11:06.607
Look, I know what
she thinks of me,

11:06.675 --> 11:08.175
but I didn't marry Jake
for his money.

11:08.243 --> 11:10.311
Is it true that you wouldn't
sign a prenuptial agreement?

11:10.378 --> 11:12.079
No.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.014
No. I was willing
to sign the prenup.

11:14.082 --> 11:15.933
Jake was the one who refused.

11:16.017 --> 11:17.685
He didn't want to give
his mother the victory.

11:17.753 --> 11:19.753
That's why we came here.

11:19.805 --> 11:21.922
To get away from her.

11:21.990 --> 11:23.691
The woman is toxic.

11:29.531 --> 11:31.699
Wait. You think
that I would do something

11:31.766 --> 11:32.766
to hurt Jake?

11:32.818 --> 11:33.784
We're not saying that, okay?

11:33.869 --> 11:35.035
But you need to understand

11:35.103 --> 11:36.654
you're our only witness
in this investigation.

11:36.738 --> 11:37.838
Yeah, and unfortunately,

11:37.906 --> 11:39.373
that does make you
a person of interest.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.009
We just got married.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.345
This is our honeymoon.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.996
Now Jake is missing.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.965
I-I can't even go back
to our hotel room

11:48.049 --> 11:49.449
because it's a crime scene.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.418
Listen, why don't you let us
set you up in a hotel room

11:51.486 --> 11:52.987
with an HPD detail?

11:53.054 --> 11:55.322
Why?
So you can keep an eye on me?

12:16.611 --> 12:20.381
This room alone is bigger
than my whole apartment.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.449
The trunk of my car is
bigger than your apartment.

12:22.501 --> 12:24.702
Oh, thanks for reminding me.

12:24.786 --> 12:27.654
So this is what
$5,500 a night buys.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.760
You know, I'm probably
biased 'cause I'm local,

12:32.828 --> 12:36.180
but I can't imagine
a honeymoon spot less exotic

12:36.264 --> 12:37.464
than a Waikiki hotel

12:37.516 --> 12:39.216
with a ukulele band
in the lobby.

12:39.301 --> 12:40.935
Why? Where do you want to go
when you get married?

12:41.002 --> 12:42.386
- Cleveland?
- Ha.

12:42.470 --> 12:44.504
If I get married,

12:44.556 --> 12:47.507
it'll probably be
somewhere with cobblestone.

12:47.559 --> 12:50.110
Like Prague or Brussels.

12:50.178 --> 12:52.229
Ooh. Fancy.

12:52.314 --> 12:54.215
Malia and I
were gonna go to Lanai.

12:54.282 --> 12:57.117
That's the furthest I could
take her on a cop's salary.

12:57.185 --> 12:59.203
Yeah. She didn't
even deserve that.

12:59.287 --> 13:02.289
Hey. Easy to judge
from a distance.

13:02.357 --> 13:03.690
It wasn't so simple.

13:03.742 --> 13:06.093
Sorry. It's just...

13:06.161 --> 13:08.262
If you want to forgive her
for abandoning you

13:08.330 --> 13:10.197
when you needed her most,
that's fine.

13:10.248 --> 13:11.665
But I sure as hell
don't have to.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.707
Hey, cuz.

13:19.774 --> 13:21.775
You smell that?

13:24.563 --> 13:26.146
What?

13:26.214 --> 13:28.249
Oh. Smells like
nail polish remover.

13:28.316 --> 13:29.650
Lots of it.

13:29.718 --> 13:31.769
Connecting suite next door.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.621
What, you think that could
have been the point of entry?

13:33.688 --> 13:36.257
Yeah. There was this
case a few years back.

13:36.324 --> 13:38.409
A burglar pumped acetone gas

13:38.493 --> 13:40.277
into a high-rise condo
before he robbed the place.

13:40.362 --> 13:41.829
Acetone,
like in nail polish remover.

13:41.896 --> 13:43.497
Yeah, exactly.
But in gas form,

13:43.565 --> 13:45.065
it actually
incapacitates the victims.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.585
So they won't wake up
during the robbery.

13:47.669 --> 13:49.270
That's disturbingly
well thought-out.

13:49.337 --> 13:50.504
It might also explain

13:50.571 --> 13:53.290
why Erica has no memory
of the abduction.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.044
Hold on.

14:04.019 --> 14:05.319
What are you doing?

14:10.609 --> 14:12.927
Just large enough
to feed a gas line through.

14:12.994 --> 14:16.280
We need to get into that room.

14:17.332 --> 14:18.666
I spoke to the manager.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.936
All the calls from Erica's cell?
Room 106, right here.

14:22.003 --> 14:23.003
Did you get a name?

14:23.014 --> 14:24.648
No. The guy paid
cash up front.

14:24.341 --> 14:26.342
He's been here a week.

14:34.384 --> 14:36.152
Hello?

14:36.219 --> 14:37.737
Hello? Anyone home?

14:37.821 --> 14:39.488
Nobody's home.
All right.

14:39.556 --> 14:41.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell are you doing?

14:41.525 --> 14:43.242
I'm trying to open it.
That's what doors do.

14:43.326 --> 14:46.245
First of all, you cannot
open doors without consent.

14:46.329 --> 14:48.114
- Is that clear?
- And second?

14:48.198 --> 14:49.365
Second, it's
probably locked.

14:49.416 --> 14:51.834
Yes. It's locked.

14:51.902 --> 14:55.037
But I may have heard
a distant cry for help.

14:55.088 --> 14:57.873
"Please help me," coming
through this door.

14:57.941 --> 15:00.376
Therefore giving us probable
cause to enter the premises.

15:00.427 --> 15:02.945
And we would be remiss not to
render assistance to that call.

15:03.013 --> 15:05.131
Right?
I agree, yes.

15:05.215 --> 15:08.768
Whoa! Whoa! What the
hell are you doing?

15:08.852 --> 15:11.387
Probable cause. I thought
we were just doing a thing.

15:11.438 --> 15:12.555
A thing... I meant

15:12.606 --> 15:13.722
that we'd get a key
from the manager,

15:13.790 --> 15:14.990
you Neanderthal animal.

15:15.058 --> 15:16.058
Okay.

15:16.126 --> 15:17.476
Just go.

15:19.296 --> 15:21.030
- Come check this out.
- I cannot wait

15:21.097 --> 15:22.298
to tell these people
that you

15:22.365 --> 15:23.866
and the state of Hawaii
owe them a new door.

15:23.934 --> 15:26.101
Erica and Jake Harris.

15:26.203 --> 15:28.537
They're in all of these.

15:28.605 --> 15:30.873
Looks like they picked up a
stalker on their honeymoon.

15:30.941 --> 15:33.275
Yeah.

15:38.882 --> 15:40.332
Gun! Gun! Oh! Oh!

15:40.417 --> 15:42.168
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Five-O!

15:42.252 --> 15:43.552
You move, I'm gonna kill you.
Okay?

15:43.620 --> 15:44.786
Yeah.

15:52.128 --> 15:54.396
Kurt Miller.
Berkeley, California.

15:54.464 --> 15:56.332
What are you people doing
in my room?

15:56.399 --> 15:58.267
We're investigating a case.
What are you doing?

15:58.335 --> 15:59.902
He's got a P.I. license.

15:59.969 --> 16:02.471
I'm investigating a case, too.

16:07.494 --> 16:10.913
This looks like our source
of the acetone.

16:27.097 --> 16:28.264
Chin!

16:28.331 --> 16:31.433
You find
something?

16:31.501 --> 16:34.303
Yeah. Jake Harris.

16:44.811 --> 16:48.482
Hey. Medical Examiner says
Jake's been dead for 12 hours.

16:49.490 --> 16:51.525
That puts the murder
at about 2:00 a.m.

16:51.579 --> 16:52.896
Fits Erica's timeline.

16:52.981 --> 16:54.614
Yeah, but that's not
the only thing.

16:54.682 --> 16:57.317
Someone fed gas into their room
from an adjoining suite.

16:57.368 --> 16:58.902
My guess is that it's acetone,

16:58.987 --> 17:00.404
which explains
Erica's memory gap

17:00.488 --> 17:02.489
and how she just woke up
in the woods.

17:02.557 --> 17:04.156
Did you get an ID on whoever
rented the adjoining suite?

17:04.208 --> 17:05.625
No. It wasn't booked
for last night.

17:05.693 --> 17:09.079
Suspect gained access
using a stolen maintenance key.

17:09.163 --> 17:10.329
You get anything on your end?

17:10.381 --> 17:12.432
I'll let you know.

17:12.500 --> 17:13.834
Look,
I know how this must look.

17:13.885 --> 17:16.536
I'm a former cop, myself.

17:16.604 --> 17:18.905
There's an abduction.
There's one person missing.

17:18.973 --> 17:20.906
You find me here with some
incriminating photos.

17:20.974 --> 17:22.642
Some incriminating
photos?

17:22.710 --> 17:23.777
Huh?
Pay attention.

17:23.845 --> 17:25.045
Magnum. All right?

17:25.096 --> 17:26.246
You're like stalkerazzi.
There's 200 photos

17:26.314 --> 17:27.848
of the same couple.

17:27.915 --> 17:29.983
I'm not saying anything else
without my counsel here.

17:30.051 --> 17:31.068
So book me if
you have to.

17:31.152 --> 17:32.219
Do not say it.

17:33.571 --> 17:35.455
Thank you.

17:35.523 --> 17:36.857
We book you, it's going
to be for murder one.

17:36.924 --> 17:38.625
What are you talking about?

17:38.693 --> 17:40.127
Jake Harris is dead.

17:40.194 --> 17:43.663
They found his body
at the Akahai.

17:53.841 --> 17:55.842
His father's an old friend.

17:55.910 --> 17:58.211
I've been working at the firm
for over 20 years

17:58.279 --> 18:00.430
as an in-house investigator.

18:02.650 --> 18:04.785
Jake was like family.

18:04.852 --> 18:06.453
Nancy asked
me to help.

18:06.521 --> 18:08.355
Nancy Harris? Jake's mother?

18:08.423 --> 18:09.656
After they got engaged,

18:09.724 --> 18:11.725
she had me run
a background check on Erica.

18:11.793 --> 18:14.227
Then the kids took off,
and she sent me to find them.

18:14.295 --> 18:15.996
How long were you tailing them?

18:16.064 --> 18:17.864
I got here after the wedding.

18:17.932 --> 18:18.899
Followed them for about a week,

18:18.966 --> 18:21.334
until two days ago.

18:21.402 --> 18:23.336
Why did you stop?

18:23.404 --> 18:25.605
I got made.

18:27.008 --> 18:29.676
Jake spotted me and demanded
I back off, so I did.

18:31.662 --> 18:34.181
Oh, maybe if I'd been there,
I could have stopped it.

18:34.248 --> 18:35.332
Okay, uh...

18:35.416 --> 18:36.516
Let me ask you a question, okay?

18:36.584 --> 18:37.784
You ran background on Erica.

18:37.835 --> 18:39.302
You saw how she was with Jake.

18:39.387 --> 18:40.520
Was she playing him?

18:42.623 --> 18:44.458
I'll tell you
like I told Nancy.

I've seen a lot
of gold diggers in my time,

18:46.227 --> 18:48.161
but Erica was not one of them.

18:48.229 --> 18:50.530
The way she loved Jake--

18:50.598 --> 18:52.599
there's no faking that.

and contract,

22:08.379 --> 22:10.413
which causes the pitch
to be off-key.

22:10.481 --> 22:14.017
I had a piano tuner,
but he liked to... chat.

22:14.085 --> 22:16.086
It was emotionally draining.

22:17.455 --> 22:20.023
Max, do you have the autopsy
results on Jake Harris?

22:20.091 --> 22:21.091
I do.

22:21.158 --> 22:23.560
C.O.D. was asphyxiation

22:23.628 --> 22:25.828
as a result of
ligature strangulation.

22:25.880 --> 22:26.963
No defensive wounds,

22:27.031 --> 22:28.098
no apparent signs
that the victim tried

22:28.165 --> 22:29.432
to resist.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.501
There was a canister
of acetone gas at the scene.

22:31.569 --> 22:32.686
We think he was sedated.

22:32.770 --> 22:34.387
Yes, that would be consistent
with the tox panel.

22:34.472 --> 22:37.607
Mr. Harris had elevated levels
of ketone in his blood.

22:37.675 --> 22:39.042
I'm guessing we'll
find the same thing

22:39.110 --> 22:40.110
when we get back
Erica's tests

22:40.177 --> 22:41.144
from the hospital.

22:41.212 --> 22:42.546
The wife was assaulted as well?

22:42.613 --> 22:44.047
Yeah, she was abducted
from the hotel.

22:44.115 --> 22:46.449
Was she taken to a remote area?

22:46.517 --> 22:47.617
Yeah.

22:47.685 --> 22:49.686
And let me guess-- they were

22:49.754 --> 22:51.121
newlyweds
here on honeymoon?

22:51.188 --> 22:53.089
Okay, how are you putting
this all together?

22:54.158 --> 22:55.709
Well, in my spare time

22:55.793 --> 22:57.994
I contribute
to an online community

22:58.062 --> 23:01.031
devoted to unsolved homicides.

23:01.098 --> 23:02.566
So you work
with dead bodies all day,

23:02.633 --> 23:04.267
and your hobby is dead bodies?

23:04.335 --> 23:05.969
I also make pickles.

23:06.037 --> 23:07.704
It's a good way
to reuse specimen jars.

23:10.808 --> 23:11.758
There we go.

23:13.761 --> 23:15.762
About a year ago there was
a series of homicides

23:15.846 --> 23:17.430
in French Polynesia.

23:17.515 --> 23:18.715
So you think

23:18.783 --> 23:20.116
they're connected
to the Harris case?

23:20.184 --> 23:21.384
Similar M.O.

23:21.452 --> 23:23.086
All victims were
newlywed couples,

23:23.154 --> 23:25.255
all were dosed with tranquilizing
agents prior to the attack,

23:25.323 --> 23:27.991
and in every case the men
were asphyxiated on site.

23:28.059 --> 23:29.926
What about the women?

23:29.994 --> 23:33.129
Well, the killer took
more time with them.

23:33.197 --> 23:37.968
They were always found 24
to 48 hours later, mutilated.

23:38.035 --> 23:40.837
Their bodies were discarded
in isolated areas.

23:40.904 --> 23:42.922
This is our guy.

23:43.007 --> 23:46.009
We have a serial killer.

23:46.077 --> 23:49.479
<i>We got three couples murdered</i>
<i>over the course of seven days.</i>

23:49.547 --> 23:53.433
One in Bora-Bora, one
in Huahine, the other in Mooréa.

23:53.517 --> 23:54.801
All of them
were newlyweds.

23:54.885 --> 23:56.519
The newlywed killer.

23:56.587 --> 23:57.654
Someone should
just tell this guy

23:57.722 --> 23:59.139
that if people stay married
long enough,

23:59.223 --> 24:00.457
they just kill each other.

24:00.524 --> 24:01.691
It gets weirder.
Check this out.

24:01.759 --> 24:03.777
So here's Erica Harris.

24:03.861 --> 24:06.929
Now, here are his
previous three female victims--

24:06.981 --> 24:08.565
all from the mainland,
dark hair, blue eyes.

24:08.616 --> 24:09.983
At least we know
he has a type.

24:10.067 --> 24:12.101
This may help us find
his next victim.

24:12.153 --> 24:14.103
And there definitely will be
a next victim.

24:14.205 --> 24:16.106
Last time this guy dropped
three bodies.

24:16.173 --> 24:17.324
All right, this guy's
pretty clever, right?

24:17.408 --> 24:18.792
He commits a crime,

24:18.876 --> 24:20.777
and before the bodies are found,
he's off to another island.

24:20.828 --> 24:23.663
Which means he may not
be on Oahu anymore.

24:23.748 --> 24:25.632
McGarrett.
I'll put out an alert

24:25.716 --> 24:27.217
to all the statewide
law enforcement agencies

24:27.284 --> 24:29.052
and send over what
we have so far. Okay.

24:29.119 --> 24:30.387
That was HPD.

24:30.454 --> 24:32.172
They found the Harris
rental car.

24:43.434 --> 24:45.769
Nothing in the trunk.

24:45.820 --> 24:48.154
The rearview is tilted up,
the seat's pushed way back.

24:48.239 --> 24:50.473
I'm thinking our guy is tall--
probably about six feet.

24:50.541 --> 24:51.875
Right, well, if Erica
was unconscious,

24:51.942 --> 24:53.285
he couldn't have
taken her very far.

24:53.289 --> 24:55.902
She said she came to
in a dark room,

24:55.913 --> 24:57.147
didn't know
where she was.

24:57.214 --> 24:59.249
We should check all nearby
storage facilities

24:59.316 --> 25:00.250
and outposts.

25:00.317 --> 25:01.751
I need all of your men.

25:01.819 --> 25:03.169
We're gonna start here,
we're gonna canvass outwards.

25:03.204 --> 25:04.337
Guys, guys,

25:04.422 --> 25:06.873
our suspect could still be here,
so look sharp.

25:06.957 --> 25:08.758
Okay, let's go.

25:08.826 --> 25:10.427
These the photos we
got off the P.I.?

25:10.494 --> 25:14.163
Yeah, he was trailing the
Harrises for over a week,

25:14.215 --> 25:15.832
snapping photos,
so I got to thinking

25:15.900 --> 25:18.401
that maybe he wasn't
the only one following them.

25:18.469 --> 25:21.204
Well, serial killers tend to
stalk their victims beforehand.

25:21.272 --> 25:22.188
So I ran the photos

25:22.273 --> 25:23.640
through the facial
recognition software.

25:23.691 --> 25:26.342
I didn't get any hits
on the national database,

25:26.394 --> 25:29.479
so... I started going
through the photos manually.

25:31.782 --> 25:34.067
You ever play Where's Waldo?

25:34.151 --> 25:35.385
Look at that.

25:35.453 --> 25:36.853
He's in three
different photographs,

25:36.921 --> 25:38.888
each one taken at a different
time in a different location.

25:38.956 --> 25:40.356
What are the odds

25:40.424 --> 25:42.358
that that's a coincidence?
That's not a coincidence.

25:42.426 --> 25:44.961
I think you just found
our serial killer.

25:54.165 --> 25:55.240
Hey, yo,

25:55.243 --> 25:57.211
over here.

25:57.279 --> 25:59.864
This door, huh?

25:59.948 --> 26:02.082
This is where he could have
been holding our victim.

26:02.150 --> 26:04.885
Okay, one, two,
three, go.

26:15.690 --> 26:16.925
Good?

26:16.991 --> 26:18.092
Clear.

26:18.112 --> 26:19.062
Hey. Look at this.

26:19.468 --> 26:20.652
This rope
has blood on it.

26:20.683 --> 26:22.667
Come check this out.

26:24.253 --> 26:26.187
Wow.

26:26.255 --> 26:27.489
Very charming fellow.

26:27.556 --> 26:28.990
Must have been the popular kid
in high school.

26:31.010 --> 26:32.627
I got morphine.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.062
This must be how he sedated her.

26:34.130 --> 26:35.964
I guess he didn't use
a big enough dose.

26:36.032 --> 26:38.400
Morphine is a Schedule I
controlled substance.

26:38.467 --> 26:39.467
Right,

26:39.535 --> 26:41.469
which means every dose
is traceable.

26:41.537 --> 26:43.054
I'll get Kono onto it.

26:49.228 --> 26:50.645
<i>Have you tracked</i>
<i>that vial of morphine?</i>

26:50.696 --> 26:53.081
Yeah, I got a hit
on the Rx number.

26:53.149 --> 26:54.382
It looks like this particular
vial was released

26:54.450 --> 26:55.817
to the chief medical officer

26:55.885 --> 26:58.319
aboard a Pacific Discovery
cruise ship-- <i>The Eternity--</i>

26:58.387 --> 27:00.688
but it was stolen from
the ship's infirmary

27:00.756 --> 27:01.990
two days ago.

27:02.058 --> 27:03.224
- A cruise ship?
- Yeah.

27:03.292 --> 27:04.159
Why, what are you thinking?

27:04.226 --> 27:05.243
The previous murders--

27:05.360 --> 27:07.796
Bora-Bora, Huahine, and Mooréa--

27:07.863 --> 27:10.065
they're all popular stops
on Polynesian cruise lines.

27:10.132 --> 27:11.733
So this guy's traveling
by cruise ship

27:11.801 --> 27:14.769
and he's stalking his victims
on shore when the boats dock.

27:14.837 --> 27:16.370
I'm betting he's on <i>The Eternity</i>
right now.

27:16.422 --> 27:18.006
McGarrett.

27:18.057 --> 27:20.058
So we took another look at
those murders from a year ago.

27:20.142 --> 27:21.309
Each one of them occurred

27:21.376 --> 27:23.178
when <i>The Star of Polynesia</i>
was docked at port.

27:23.229 --> 27:25.046
That's a cruise ship
that tours those islands.

27:25.114 --> 27:26.848
Dates and locations
match exactly.

27:26.899 --> 27:29.317
Now we know how he got from
island to island-- on that boat.

27:29.384 --> 27:31.086
Right,
and that morphine you found?

27:31.153 --> 27:33.888
That was just stolen off a
local ship called <i>The Eternity.</i>

27:33.939 --> 27:35.907
I checked the passenger lists
for both cruise ships,

27:35.991 --> 27:37.759
and there's one name
that appears on both.

27:37.827 --> 27:40.762
Bradford Matinsky, 36.

27:40.830 --> 27:43.031
He boarded <i>The Eternity</i> four
days ago on the Big Island.

27:43.099 --> 27:45.083
And he matches the photos
we got off of that P.I.

27:45.167 --> 27:46.234
This is our guy.

27:46.285 --> 27:47.585
Okay, where's that ship now?

27:47.670 --> 27:50.105
Ten miles off of Kauai--
it's scheduled to dock

27:50.172 --> 27:52.407
in less than an hour,
right around sunrise.

27:52.475 --> 27:54.309
We're working on all our options
to keep it at dock.

27:54.376 --> 27:55.927
Okay, well, tell them
Customs is backed up,

27:56.011 --> 27:57.245
call in a bomb threat.

27:57.296 --> 27:59.180
Hell, have CDC quarantine
the entire ship

27:59.248 --> 28:00.799
on suspicion
of a black plague outbreak.

28:00.883 --> 28:02.267
I don't care what you do.

28:02.351 --> 28:03.551
Okay, nobody disembarks.

28:03.619 --> 28:04.803
Got it.

28:12.361 --> 28:13.528
Give me those two.

28:13.596 --> 28:15.497
Okay, thanks.

28:15.564 --> 28:17.615
Put that on.

28:17.700 --> 28:19.834
Absolutely not.

28:19.902 --> 28:21.436
Listen, we're going
after a dangerous suspect

28:21.504 --> 28:23.505
who may now be aware
the police are after him.

28:23.572 --> 28:25.156
We don't want to spook him;
we want to blend in.

28:25.241 --> 28:26.207
Put the lei on.

28:26.275 --> 28:28.159
Please don't make me wear
flowers.

28:28.244 --> 28:30.829
Danny, we don't have
a lot of time.

28:30.913 --> 28:33.298
I'm gonna do it, okay,
but I'm not gonna be happy.

28:33.382 --> 28:34.382
And take the tie off.

28:34.449 --> 28:35.750
No one on a cruise
ship wears a tie.

28:35.818 --> 28:37.118
Oh, yes, they do,
they do all the time

28:37.186 --> 28:38.670
so they can hang themselves
when they're bored.

28:38.754 --> 28:39.754
Okay, well,
put it in your pocket

28:39.805 --> 28:41.022
and you can kill yourself later.

28:48.063 --> 28:49.998
Kalia deck, cabin 226.

28:50.065 --> 28:52.066
Make sure the corridors
are clear before we go in.

28:52.134 --> 28:54.502
I'm not going to put
any passengers at risk.

28:57.106 --> 28:59.858
Keep all these folks back, okay?

29:04.747 --> 29:06.748
All right.

29:11.854 --> 29:13.788
Ready?

29:13.839 --> 29:16.391
One, two...

29:28.888 --> 29:30.338
He's not here.

29:30.389 --> 29:32.173
<i>Listen up.</i>

29:32.224 --> 29:33.691
You guys have been docked here
for over an hour,

29:33.776 --> 29:35.193
which means our suspect
is more than likely

29:35.277 --> 29:36.511
getting a little antsy
right now,

29:36.579 --> 29:39.180
so we need to execute the search
as quickly as possible

29:39.248 --> 29:40.815
before he takes things
into his own hands.

29:40.883 --> 29:41.866
Take a look at the photos

29:41.951 --> 29:43.117
and pass 'em along.

29:43.185 --> 29:44.852
His name is Bradford Matinsky.

29:44.904 --> 29:45.853
He's six feet tall,

29:45.905 --> 29:46.905
36 years old.

29:46.989 --> 29:48.406
He's extremely dangerous

29:48.490 --> 29:51.025
and he's more than likely armed,
so do not try to apprehend him.

29:51.076 --> 29:52.126
Okay?

29:52.194 --> 29:53.745
If you spot him,
you radio me immediately.

29:53.829 --> 29:54.879
Got that?

29:54.964 --> 29:58.066
Okay, move out,
let's go, let's go, go.

30:00.085 --> 30:02.754
Unfortunately, we
are experiencing

30:02.838 --> 30:05.540
mechanical issues with
the gangway at this point.

30:05.608 --> 30:09.543
For your safety we ask
that you remain onboard

30:09.595 --> 30:11.546
until further notice.

30:11.614 --> 30:13.448
I'm sure we'll be
able to get you folks

30:13.515 --> 30:15.950
underway soon.

30:16.018 --> 30:16.935
<i>Danny,</i>

30:17.019 --> 30:19.020
check that suitcase.

30:23.626 --> 30:27.278
We got to find out how
this guy picks his victims.

30:27.363 --> 30:28.947
Heads up.

30:29.031 --> 30:31.032
What do you got?

30:34.903 --> 30:37.205
Wedding and engagement rings.

30:37.256 --> 30:38.423
Matinsky took these
off his victims.

30:38.507 --> 30:39.440
These are trophies

30:39.508 --> 30:40.441
of his kills.

30:40.509 --> 30:42.977
This guy is beyond disturbed.

30:43.045 --> 30:45.179
Okay, I bet he even eats
from the buffet line.

30:45.247 --> 30:48.049
Wait a minute, Danny,
check this out.

30:55.057 --> 30:57.725
Looks like this guy did
his homework.

30:59.812 --> 31:01.762
These are from the Akahai's

31:01.814 --> 31:03.598
internal booking system.

31:03.666 --> 31:05.933
It's a reservation list
for every room in the hotel,

31:06.001 --> 31:07.151
and Jake Harris' name
is circled.

31:07.236 --> 31:08.536
How the hell
does he get this stuff?

31:08.603 --> 31:11.539
He's got travel itineraries,
topography maps,

31:11.606 --> 31:12.790
wedding announcements.

31:14.510 --> 31:16.744
All the women look alike.

31:17.880 --> 31:20.982
In each of these couples
all the women...

31:21.050 --> 31:23.551
That's how he does it.

31:23.619 --> 31:25.336
That's how
he does it.

31:25.421 --> 31:27.021
Danny, look,
they're all couples.

31:27.089 --> 31:28.690
He finds couples booked
into honeymoon suites

31:28.757 --> 31:30.008
and he stalks them online.

31:30.092 --> 31:32.360
Finds the ones that fit his M.O.

31:32.428 --> 31:34.429
I mean, we got... we got
at least four couples here.

31:34.496 --> 31:35.897
Okay, so how are

31:35.964 --> 31:37.682
we going to find out who's next?
I don't know, pick.

31:37.766 --> 31:38.983
SECURITY OFFICER
Commander McGarrett.

31:42.271 --> 31:45.673
Commander McGarrett,
I've got eyes on the suspect.

31:47.576 --> 31:49.660
Atrium deck,
headed down the stairwell.

31:49.745 --> 31:52.146
Copy that.
Do not close on Matinsky, okay?

31:52.197 --> 31:53.548
We're headed your way.

32:06.345 --> 32:08.346
I'm still on him.

32:09.765 --> 32:11.566
He's heading
towards the staterooms on the...

32:22.061 --> 32:24.278
Danny.

32:25.180 --> 32:26.614
I got him, go ahead.

32:26.681 --> 32:27.698
You all right?

32:27.783 --> 32:28.866
He went that way.

32:33.589 --> 32:35.022
Ma'am, back in your room.

32:35.074 --> 32:37.075
Back in your room,
close the door.

33:13.829 --> 33:15.696
All right, Coast Guard's
got divers in the water.

33:15.747 --> 33:17.665
Kauai PD has been up
and down the shoreline.

33:17.666 --> 33:18.640
There's no sign
of Matinsky.

33:18.641 --> 33:20.248
Yeah, he's gone.
Question is, where did he go?

33:20.272 --> 33:21.628
All right, he could have gotten
on the plane

33:21.629 --> 33:22.880
when Erica got away,
but he didn't.

33:22.904 --> 33:24.094
All right,
he got back on the boat.

33:24.155 --> 33:25.938
That's right,
'cause he's not a runner.

33:25.990 --> 33:28.792
His drive to kill overpowers
his self-preservation instincts.

33:28.876 --> 33:30.827
He didn't kill Erica, so
now he needs a substitute.

33:30.911 --> 33:33.112
All right, listen, I'm looking
over his file. Check this out.

33:33.164 --> 33:34.331
Kristen
and Elliott Clark.

33:34.415 --> 33:36.166
Right? They got married
four days ago.

33:36.250 --> 33:37.950
Travel itinerary says that

33:38.002 --> 33:40.286
they are in Kauai now
staying in a honeymoon suite

33:40.354 --> 33:41.655
at a hotel
that I cannot pronounce.

33:41.722 --> 33:42.889
The Hikina.

33:42.956 --> 33:44.224
That's not
far from here.

33:47.762 --> 33:50.397
<i>All right, Chin,</i>
<i>you got me and super SEAL.</i>

33:50.464 --> 33:51.981
Go ahead.
Hey.

33:52.066 --> 33:54.184
So I dug up a little more
background info

33:54.268 --> 33:55.819
on our man Bradford Matinsky.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.604
Turns out,
he's a systems analyst

33:57.672 --> 33:59.489
for an engineering firm
in Lansing, Michigan.

33:59.573 --> 34:00.973
Well, explains his
computer skills.

34:01.025 --> 34:03.827
Two years ago, he was engaged to
be married to a Natalie Hayes.

34:03.911 --> 34:06.680
They were planning
a big beach wedding in Barbados.

34:06.747 --> 34:09.581
Let me guess. She had a change
of heart. Can't imagine why.

34:09.650 --> 34:10.817
Took it pretty hard, though.

34:10.868 --> 34:12.819
He quit his job,
he went on unemployment.

34:12.870 --> 34:13.985
And two months later,

34:14.038 --> 34:15.121
Natalie Hayes goes missing.

34:15.172 --> 34:16.255
Surprise, surprise.

34:16.322 --> 34:17.791
Was Matinsky ever charged?

34:17.858 --> 34:19.259
No.

34:19.326 --> 34:20.510
He was a person of interest,

34:20.594 --> 34:21.828
but he was never formally
charged with the crime.

34:21.879 --> 34:23.763
Case is still unsolved.

34:23.831 --> 34:25.130
All right, so this nut job
kills his fiancée,

34:25.181 --> 34:26.331
and now he's living out

34:26.384 --> 34:27.851
some sort of sick,
sadistic revenge fantasy.

34:27.935 --> 34:30.704
Exactly. The dates
of the murders coincide

34:30.771 --> 34:32.222
with the anniversary
of the wedding,

34:32.306 --> 34:33.440
almost to the day.

34:33.507 --> 34:35.358
Marriage gets called off
in December of '08.

34:35.443 --> 34:37.744
Polynesian murders go down
in December of '09.

34:37.812 --> 34:40.362
And a year later, here we are.

34:43.684 --> 34:44.984
Oh, crap.

34:45.034 --> 34:47.353
I thought I turned it off.

34:47.420 --> 34:50.072
Oh, honey, you just completely
ruined my Zen.

34:50.157 --> 34:52.074
Sorry. It's a
private number.

34:52.159 --> 34:53.576
Don't do it.

34:53.661 --> 34:55.428
It could be my parents.

34:55.496 --> 34:56.862
Exactly.

34:56.931 --> 34:58.131
Hello?

34:58.199 --> 34:59.666
Aloha, Mrs. Clark.

34:59.734 --> 35:01.234
This is Jonathan
from guest services.

35:01.302 --> 35:02.535
I'm sorry to disturb you,

35:02.586 --> 35:04.738
but you have a call
at the front desk.

35:04.805 --> 35:06.506
I'm in the middle of a massage.

35:06.574 --> 35:08.040
Do you know what it's about?

35:08.092 --> 35:09.259
I'm sorry, I don't,

35:09.343 --> 35:11.010
but they said
it's a family emergency.

35:11.061 --> 35:12.712
Oh, my God. Okay.

35:12.780 --> 35:13.897
I'll be right there.

35:13.981 --> 35:15.749
There's a courtesy phone
on the second floor

35:15.816 --> 35:17.150
at the end of the hallway.

35:17.218 --> 35:19.052
I can connect you from there.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.687
Thanks. I'm on my way.

35:27.662 --> 35:29.272
I wasn't able
to get in touch with the Clarks.

35:29.273 --> 35:30.740
All right, we're still
ten minutes out.

35:30.807 --> 35:31.991
We need to find them.

35:32.076 --> 35:33.609
Get their security on it.

35:35.645 --> 35:37.697
This can't be right.

35:37.781 --> 35:40.283
I don't know. He said the
courtesy phone would be here.

35:40.367 --> 35:41.868
I said to look for...

36:11.615 --> 36:13.199
Hey, that's him right there.

36:13.283 --> 36:14.317
That's him?
That's him.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.601
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Relax!

36:41.578 --> 36:43.346
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Go! Go! Go! I'm going.

37:03.066 --> 37:04.734
All right!

37:04.785 --> 37:07.286
May 18, 1996.

37:07.371 --> 37:08.704
What is that?

37:08.772 --> 37:09.872
It's the last time I puked.

37:09.940 --> 37:11.374
All right, don't make me
break my streak.

37:11.441 --> 37:13.910
You will not puke in this
car. You will <i>not</i> puke...

37:13.961 --> 37:16.212
Hey!

37:18.282 --> 37:19.715
If you're gonna be
sick in here,

37:19.783 --> 37:21.017
you crack that window.
This is a loaner.

37:35.265 --> 37:36.516
Oh, truck! Truck!
Truck! Truck!

37:36.600 --> 37:37.600
Truck!

37:44.408 --> 37:45.741
Get on it! Get on it! Let's go!
I'm on it.

38:13.503 --> 38:15.771
He's got Kristen.

38:15.839 --> 38:17.506
Come on, come on.
Yeah.

38:28.535 --> 38:29.886
Drop your weapon!

38:29.953 --> 38:31.354
Stay back!

38:31.421 --> 38:33.906
I'm warning you.

38:33.991 --> 38:35.041
Stay right there!

38:35.125 --> 38:37.877
Put the guns down!

38:37.961 --> 38:40.396
Put your weapon and let
the girl go, please.

38:40.464 --> 38:41.914
I do, and I go
to jail.

38:41.999 --> 38:43.215
You don't, and you die.

38:43.300 --> 38:45.885
So does she!

38:45.969 --> 38:48.237
Listen to me, huh?

38:48.305 --> 38:49.906
We know about
your fiancée.

38:49.973 --> 38:53.309
We know she left you on the
altar in front of your friends,

38:53.377 --> 38:55.761
in front of your family.

38:55.846 --> 38:57.313
We know that must have hurt.

38:59.066 --> 39:01.100
You don't know anything.

39:01.184 --> 39:02.885
I do, all right?
I know what it's like

39:02.936 --> 39:04.654
to have someone you love
walk away from you.

39:04.721 --> 39:06.489
What are you doing?

39:06.556 --> 39:07.823
What?
What are you doing?

39:07.891 --> 39:09.659
The guy's clearly
a psychopath.

39:09.726 --> 39:11.527
You trying to make friends with
him, you trying to connect?

39:11.595 --> 39:12.762
He's standing
right in front of us.

39:12.829 --> 39:13.930
I see he's standing
right here, Danny,

39:13.997 --> 39:15.097
but you're a cop.

39:15.165 --> 39:16.415
You're not a therapist,
you know?

39:16.500 --> 39:17.867
Hey, hey, hey, I
have been trained

39:17.935 --> 39:19.285
for this kind
of thing, okay?

39:19.369 --> 39:20.836
What, what, to bore people
into submission?

39:20.904 --> 39:22.672
Don't listen to him, okay?

39:22.739 --> 39:24.507
His idea of
communication

39:24.574 --> 39:26.959
is-is he drops a witty one-liner
and then shoots you in the face.

39:27.044 --> 39:28.127
Don't worry about it.
Know what?

39:28.211 --> 39:29.295
I'm might shoot
this guy just so

39:29.379 --> 39:30.463
he doesn't have
to listen to you talk.

39:30.547 --> 39:31.380
Why don't you
do your thing,

39:31.431 --> 39:33.049
I'll do mine, all right?
Okay.

39:35.686 --> 39:37.019
Walk towards me.

39:37.087 --> 39:38.220
Walk towards me.

39:39.356 --> 39:40.856
Matinsky, put
the knife down.

39:40.924 --> 39:42.024
It's over.
It's over!

39:42.092 --> 39:43.258
No! No! No! No!

39:50.567 --> 39:52.735
Hey, hey, you're okay.

39:52.786 --> 39:54.603
Come here, come here.
You're all right.

39:54.655 --> 39:56.322
You okay?

40:13.357 --> 40:16.258
I don't know
that I can do this.

40:16.326 --> 40:18.928
I don't think
you can afford not to.

40:18.996 --> 40:21.764
You accused your daughter-in-law
of some pretty terrible things.

40:21.832 --> 40:24.367
She has every reason
to hate you right now, but,

40:24.434 --> 40:27.570
the truth is,
she needs you.

40:27.637 --> 40:29.839
You both loved him.

40:29.906 --> 40:31.374
And despite everything,

40:31.441 --> 40:32.541
you're family.

40:32.609 --> 40:34.443
That should stand
for something.

40:34.511 --> 40:36.946
Do you really think
that she'll forgive me?

40:37.014 --> 40:40.049
Never know unless you try.

40:47.124 --> 40:49.125
Take all the
time you need.

41:05.142 --> 41:07.476
Hey, got a minute?

41:07.544 --> 41:09.528
Yeah.

41:11.548 --> 41:13.482
So, I heard back

41:13.533 --> 41:15.184
from my guy
over at the HPD archives.

41:15.235 --> 41:17.737
He looked up that case number
that your dad had written down.

41:17.821 --> 41:19.739
What did he say?

41:19.823 --> 41:20.956
The file is missing.

41:21.024 --> 41:22.858
Which means it was
either lost somehow...

41:22.926 --> 41:24.126
Or somebody stole it?

41:24.194 --> 41:25.494
Yeah. I was able

41:25.545 --> 41:27.196
to get a little bit
of information

41:27.264 --> 41:28.931
just based
on the file number itself.

41:28.999 --> 41:30.232
Here's the thing.

41:30.300 --> 41:32.084
The case was opened on April 19,

41:32.169 --> 41:34.170
1992.

41:36.173 --> 41:38.641
That was, uh...
That was the day

41:38.708 --> 41:41.243
my mother had her car accident,
the day she died.

41:41.311 --> 41:43.229
Yeah.

41:43.313 --> 41:46.449
Okay, uh... why...

41:46.516 --> 41:49.285
Why would somebody steal
my mother's accident report?

41:49.352 --> 41:50.519
Because according to this,

41:50.570 --> 41:52.855
it wasn't an accident report.

41:52.923 --> 41:54.607
What are you talking about,
Chin?

41:54.691 --> 41:57.159
It was a homicide.

42:02.332 --> 42:04.300
You're saying
that my mother was murdered?

42:06.336 --> 42:08.403
I think that's what
your father was investigating.
