00:00.200 --> 00:01.900
Previously On Ugly Betty,

00:01.900 --> 00:03.000
You Are The Gym Teacher?

00:03.000 --> 00:03.800
Yes.

00:03.800 --> 00:05.900
Is There Any Chance That You Know 
Who My Father Is?

00:05.900 --> 00:09.100
I Didn't See Anything
But The ??? Bird Tattoo On His Ass.

00:09.100 --> 00:11.000
??? Is My Father.

00:11.000 --> 00:11.700
Daddy?

00:11.700 --> 00:12.400
Daughter?

00:12.400 --> 00:14.200
I'm Having Your Father's Child.

00:14.200 --> 00:18.100
My Only Concern Is Giving It 
Everything It Deserves.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.000
And What Would That Be?

00:19.000 --> 00:20.300
One-Third 

00:20.300 --> 00:22.000
Of The Mead Empire.

00:22.000 --> 00:22.700
Henry.

00:22.700 --> 00:23.600
You Are Not In Tucson?

00:23.600 --> 00:24.600
I'm Going Back.

00:25.100 --> 00:25.600
What?

00:25.600 --> 00:28.600
My Brother's Totally ??? On Your Girlfriend.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.700
I'm Not A Big Believer 
In This Whole Fantasy Thing

00:30.700 --> 00:33.300
But I Believe That You Want To Have 
A Bit Of Yours.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.000
I'm Lucky.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.900
Except For The Part When Henry's 
Leaving Me After His Baby's Born.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.700
Oh, God.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.900
Did You Hear Her
Crying Last Night?

01:09.900 --> 01:11.500
<I>Ay, It's Only Been
Two Weeks, Papi.</I>

01:11.500 --> 01:13.700
She Loved Henry.
She Needs To Go Through This.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.500
I Just Wish There Were
Something We Could Do.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.800
- There Is. You Can Buy More Tissues. 
- Hi.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.800
Hilda, You're Out
Of Your Puffy Eye Cream Stuff.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.500
- Sorry. 
- Oh, Don't Worry, Aunt Betty. I'm On It.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.000
Well,
I Hope You're Hungry,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.700
'Cause You're Just In Time
For Eggs A La Hilda.

01:28.700 --> 01:31.300
- What's Eggs A La Hilda?
- It's Scrambled Eggs.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.500
<I>Papi,
I Don't Want To Hear It.</I>

01:32.500 --> 01:34.400
You're Sick.
I'm Making Breakfast.

01:34.400 --> 01:39.500
<I>- Hilda, I'm Not Very Hungry. 
- Amor, You've Barely Eaten Since 
Henry Went Back To Tucson.</I>

01:39.600 --> 01:40.400
It's True, Aunt Betty.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.400
<I>You've Been Looking
Really Skinny.</I>

01:43.000 --> 01:46.200
- That's Supposed To Sound Bad.
- Guys, You're All Being So Sweet,

01:46.400 --> 01:49.400
But I Do Not Want You
Worrying About Me, Okay?

01:49.400 --> 01:52.800
Henry And I Agreed
A Clean Break Would Be Best.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.600
You Know, When I Break Up
With A Guy...

01:54.800 --> 01:57.400
I Like To Get A Little Bit Scary
So He Doesn't Forget Me.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.000
All Right, Justin, Come On.
We Gotta Go.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.500
- I Gotta Get Ready For 
The P.T.A. Thing This Morning. 
- Since When Are You On The P.T.A.?

02:02.500 --> 02:06.700
- Since She Has A Crush On My Gym Teacher. 
- What? Who? Tony? He's Okay.

02:06.700 --> 02:09.900
- Why? Did He Say Something? 
Do You Think He Likes Me? 
- What's Not To Like?

02:09.900 --> 02:12.600
Oh, My God. He's Such A Good...
Mwah. Mwah. Mwah.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.600
- Such A Good Boy. Here. Have Some
Juice A La Hilda. 
- What Is This?

02:16.600 --> 02:17.900
It's Juice.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.700
<I>Mija, You Seem Tired.</I>

02:20.700 --> 02:22.200
Can't You Take
A Little Time Off Work?

02:22.200 --> 02:25.500
No. Are You Kidding?
Work Is The Only Thing

02:25.500 --> 02:27.900
That Kind Of Keeps My Mind
Off Of Henry.

02:27.900 --> 02:30.500
I'm Secretly Hoping
The "Mode" Drama Doesn't End.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.800
Will The Drama
At "Mode" Ever End?

02:32.800 --> 02:35.000
Fashion Diva
And Headline Stealer

02:35.000 --> 02:36.900
Wilhelmina Slater
Is Back On The Scene

02:36.900 --> 02:39.100
With Child... Ish.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.900
She'll Be Using
An Unnamed Surrogate

02:40.900 --> 02:42.000
To Birth The Baby.

02:42.200 --> 02:45.700
Wilhelmina... A Mother Again?
She's Certainly Been Called One.

02:45.700 --> 02:48.900
The Babe Was Confirmed To Be
The Spawn Of Bradford Meade,

02:49.100 --> 02:51.300
Who Gifted Wilhelmina
With His Frozen Swimmers

02:51.300 --> 02:52.900
Just Before His Death.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
And They Say Romance Is Dead.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.400
Will La Slater
Return To "Mode"?

02:57.500 --> 02:59.700
<I>Will The Baby Own A Share
Of The Meade Fortune?</I>

03:00.000 --> 03:00.900
Insiders Tell Me

03:00.900 --> 03:03.900
<I>The Meades Are Fighting Her
Tooth And French Tip Nail</I>

03:04.000 --> 03:06.100
<I>With A Legal Decision
Expected This Morning.</I>

03:07.100 --> 03:09.100
No, Daniel Is Not Available.

03:09.100 --> 03:12.900
- We Will Be Releasing A Statement
This Afternoon. 
- Any News Yet?

03:13.200 --> 03:15.200
No, They're On The Phone
With The Lawyer Right Now.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.800
I Don't Know.
Maybe The News Will Be Good.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.700
- Maybe Wilhelmina Will Have Lost. 
- Wilhelmina Never Loses.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.800
Oh, Why Did I Agree
To Have This Baby?

03:22.800 --> 03:24.400
Christina,
You Didn't Have A Choice.

03:24.400 --> 03:29.300
- You Needed The Money For Stuart's Operation.
- Ohh, Oh. Claire Meade Looked At Me.

03:29.400 --> 03:33.800
- She Hates Me. I Don't Blame Her. 
- She Doesn't Hate You. And She'll 
Totally Understand.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.000
Look, Look, Look.
They're Coming Out Now.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.500
Just Take A Deep Breath...

03:37.400 --> 03:39.100
Look Her In The Eye
And Just Explain It...

03:41.500 --> 03:43.200
So... Is It Bad?

03:43.200 --> 03:45.400
It's Terrible.
Our Father's Will Divided

03:45.400 --> 03:47.000
The Company Evenly
Among His Children.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.900
- Unfortunately, That Includes 
Future Children? 
- None Of This Makes Any Sense.

03:50.900 --> 03:53.300
Bradford Never Wanted
To Have Another Child,

03:53.600 --> 03:57.600
- <I>And Now To Have One With Her? 
- It's Happening, And Until That Kid Turns 18,</I>

03:57.800 --> 03:59.700
Wilhelmina Controls
A Third Of This Company.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.600
So... That Means?

04:01.600 --> 04:03.700
Wilhelmina Is Back.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.500
Let's Do This Bitch.

04:37.100 --> 04:40.400
<I>If She Tries Anything,
Call Security.</I>

04:41.500 --> 04:42.500
I Can Take Her.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.400
What? I Can.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.600
Whatever Happens,
I'm Right Here.

04:52.900 --> 04:54.900
Family Meade,
I Just Want To Say,

04:54.900 --> 04:57.800
How Thrilled And Honored
I Am To Be Back Here.

04:57.900 --> 04:58.600
Today Is A New Day,

04:58.600 --> 05:01.400
And I Hope We Can All
Put The Past Behind Us.

05:16.700 --> 05:18.200
Wonderful Seeing You All.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.900
<I>Oh, Now That Was Fun.</I>

05:29.800 --> 05:31.100
Am I Smiling? I Can't Tell.

05:31.100 --> 05:34.200
I Think You Are.
Oh, Willie...

05:35.500 --> 05:36.700
It's So Good
To Be Back

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
And To Have
Health Insurance Again,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.100
Because I Have
This Weird Mole Thing.

05:40.100 --> 05:43.000
But Daniel Still Runs "Mode,"
And Alexis Still Runs Meade.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.100
What's Our Next Move?

05:45.400 --> 05:47.500
To Divide The House Of Meade.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.300
We'll Start
With The Weakest Link.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.800
Did You See The Look
On Daniel's Face?

05:52.500 --> 05:53.600
Terror.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.300
If There's One Thing I Know
How To Do, It's Manipulate Fear.

05:56.300 --> 05:59.800
You Are A Horror Movie
I Wish Would Never End.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.200
I Can't Believe
This Is Happening.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.600
<I>I Mean, I've Had Nightmares
About Her Coming Back.</I>

06:05.700 --> 06:07.900
They Usually End With Her
Stabbing Me With A Stiletto

06:07.900 --> 06:09.900
And Turning Into A-Poof!
Bat.

06:09.900 --> 06:14.100
- Daniel, Keep It Together. 
- How Can I? She's Been After My Job 
Since I Started Here.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.500
Well, She's Not Gonna Get It,
So Stop Panting.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.700
Wilhelmina Has No Creative Input
Here Whatsoever.

06:18.700 --> 06:21.200
She's Nothing More Than
A Chanel Suit With An Office.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.100
Yes, But She's One-Third
Of This Company,

06:23.200 --> 06:25.300
<I>And She's Got
The Devil On Her Side.</I>

06:25.300 --> 06:27.000
Yeah, But The Devil
Doesn't Get A Vote.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.800
There's Two Of Us,
And There's One Of Her.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.300
Do You Know What?
You're Right.

06:32.300 --> 06:35.100
- It's Two Against One.
- Exactly, So Relax.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.200
We Won't Make A Move
Without One Another.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.700
Whew.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.700
Mrs. Meade,
I'm Taking Lunch Orders.

06:52.700 --> 06:56.600
- Could I Get You Something? 
- Actually, I Was Just About To Call You.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.100
There Is Something
You Can Do For Me.

06:58.100 --> 07:01.600
- <I>You Can Write An Article
For "Hot Flash." 
- An Article?</I>

07:01.600 --> 07:04.200
Yes. I'm Short
Four Pages Of Content.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.600
Now I Know "Hot Flash" Is
A Magazine For Older Women,

07:06.600 --> 07:09.000
But You Could Give It
Its Youth Perspective.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.700
300 Words
By Tomorrow Morning.

07:11.800 --> 07:15.600
Yeah. Okay.
Uh, I Can Do This.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.000
So, Like, When You Say,
"Youth Perspective,"

07:20.000 --> 07:21.100
What Does That Mean Exactly?

07:21.100 --> 07:24.400
Betty, Betty,
You're The Writer.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.300
Figure It Out.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.300
I'm The Writer.

07:27.800 --> 07:28.600
Okay.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.600
Uh, Okay.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.200
Oh, And, Mrs. Meade?

07:34.400 --> 07:35.500
Thank You.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.600
You're Welcome.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.200
Mad Props
On The Dramatic Entrance.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.700
I Wanted To Use A Strobe Light
As We Hit The Tube,

07:49.700 --> 07:51.600
But Wil Said
It Was Over-The-Top.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.900
<I>- O- M-G, We Have So Much
To Catch Up On. 
- I Know.</I>

07:54.900 --> 07:55.600
- Me First.
- Oh.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.100
You Know How I've Been
Working With My Father,

07:57.100 --> 07:59.600
Gene Simmons From Kiss,
On A New Reality Show?

07:59.700 --> 08:03.900
Well, Prepare Yo'self.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.000
<I>* This Is The Story</I>

08:06.000 --> 08:07.800
<I>* The Story Is True</I>

08:07.800 --> 08:10.000
<I>* How I Found My Daughter</I>

08:10.000 --> 08:11.700
<I>* He Never Even Knew-Ew</I>

08:11.700 --> 08:15.500
<I>* She Tracked Me Down
* With Only One Clue</I>

08:15.500 --> 08:17.300
<I>* It Was On My Butt</I>

08:17.300 --> 08:19.200
<I>* That Fateful</I>

08:19.200 --> 08:21.300
<I>* Tattoo
* Tattoo</I>

08:21.300 --> 08:23.200
<I>* On My Butt
* What? What?</I>

08:24.200 --> 08:25.800
<I>"Daddy's Little Girl."</I>

08:26.900 --> 08:27.900
Mandy...

08:28.000 --> 08:30.100
You're Gonna Be
A Reality Tv Star.

08:30.100 --> 08:33.299
It's What Every Pretty Girl With
No Specific Talent Dreams Of.

08:33.299 --> 08:35.100
I Know, Right?
And Every Episode,

08:35.100 --> 08:37.200
We Do A New Fun,
Father-Daughter Activity.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.299
You Know, Like Camping
Or Riding Bikes

08:39.299 --> 08:43.799
- Or Trashing A Hotel Room. 
- Oh, You Know What? 
Every Successful Tv Show Has

08:43.799 --> 08:46.700
- A Shticky, Gay Best Friend Sidekick. 
- No. No, No, Marc. You Can't Be On The Show.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.900
Come On. Why Not?
Marc And Amanda.

08:48.900 --> 08:51.400
We're So Funny Together.
Everyone Says So.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.300
Okay.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.900
There's No Other Way
To Tell You This-

08:55.300 --> 08:57.500
You Know How, In Real Life,
You're Always So Jumpy

08:57.500 --> 08:59.700
And Bopping Your Head
And Moving Around...

08:59.800 --> 09:01.300
Like...

09:01.600 --> 09:02.800
Well,
That Makes You Blurry,

09:03.000 --> 09:06.100
And On Tv, People Can
Actually See Your Face.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.200
Wow.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.800
You're Cute,
But You're Not Tv Cute.

09:11.100 --> 09:14.200
- I Am So Glad I Got That Off My Chest. 
I Feel So Much Better. 
- Oh.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.900
- You Wanna Watch It Again?
- Sure.

09:19.200 --> 09:22.900
Okay, Eight Turkey,
Six Veggie,

09:22.900 --> 09:24.200
Four Chicken Curry Salad

09:24.200 --> 09:25.700
- And Two Salami.
- Mm-Hmm.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.300
Man, You Sure Are
Hungry Today.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.800
Hey, That's The First Time
I've Ever Gotten A Smile

09:29.800 --> 09:33.800
- Off That Joke. 
- Well, Today Has Turned Out To 
Be Not So Terrible.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.500
Claire Meade Asked Me To Write
An Article For "Hot Flash."

09:36.500 --> 09:39.200
Hey, That's A Big Deal.

09:39.300 --> 09:43.000
- Yeah. I Guess It Is A Big Deal.
- Here, Have A Black-And-White Cookie.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.300
- I Haven't Even Told Anybody Yet. 
- Oh, I'm The First Person You Told, Huh?

09:47.300 --> 09:48.900
- Mm-Hmm.
- Figures.

09:49.700 --> 09:51.400
- What Does That Mean?
- You Tell Me Everything.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.600
- No, I Don't.
- Yes, You Do.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.400
- No, I Don't.
- Oh, Yes, You Do.

09:55.900 --> 09:58.900
You're Always Down Here,
Telling Me About Your Day,

09:58.900 --> 10:03.300
- Flirting, Ordering Sandwiches... 
- Uh, It's A Sandwich Shop, And I Wasn't Flirting.

10:03.300 --> 10:07.200
Oh, Come On. Every Time
I Turn Around, You're There.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.800
You Know, You're Kind
Of Stalking Me A Little Bit.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.500
Uh... What?

10:11.500 --> 10:13.500
You Like Me.
There's Nothing Wrong With That.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.400
- Just Admit It.
- You Are Insane.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.400
Come On. You'll Feel Better
If You Say It Out Loud.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.900
- You Want Me To Be Your Rebound Guy.
- I Came Down Here For Sandwiches,

10:22.900 --> 10:25.400
And All Of The Sudden,
You're My Rebound Guy?

10:25.700 --> 10:27.500
Gio, I Just Got
Out Of A Relation-

10:30.300 --> 10:31.300
Mm.

11:01.100 --> 11:02.900
"The Youth Perspective."

11:04.600 --> 11:05.500
"Youth."

11:10.400 --> 11:11.800
I Wasn't Flirting.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.600
Mode21 To Everyone:
Guess Who Ordered The Tongue
At Gio's Deli?

11:25.500 --> 11:28.000
Betty Whorez Is Out Of Control!

11:42.100 --> 11:44.900
As Far As The November Cover
Is Concerned, I Was-

11:45.100 --> 11:47.900
I'm Sorry I'm Late.
I Must Not Have Gotten The Memo.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.600
No, Wilhelmina.
You Weren't Invited.

11:51.600 --> 11:52.700
I Realize That,

11:53.300 --> 11:54.800
And I Was Speaking
To My Lawyer,

11:54.800 --> 11:57.700
And Apparently, I Have
Every Legal Right To Observe.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.100
Okay, Fine, But You Have
No Official Capacity At "Mode,"

12:01.100 --> 12:04.600
- And That Means Zero Input.
- I Understand.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.400
I'm Merely Someone
Who Controls

12:06.400 --> 12:08.300
One-Third
Of The Parent Corporation,

12:08.800 --> 12:11.600
Which Owns Everything
And Everyone In Here.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.400
But You Won't Even Notice Me.
Quiet As A Mouse.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.500
Oh, My God.
It Looks Like She's Eating Him.

12:20.600 --> 12:21.800
I'm Gonna Pee.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.700
<I>She Does Realize That
That's The Sandwich Guy</I>

12:23.700 --> 12:26.000
And Not An Actual Sandwich,
Right?

12:27.600 --> 12:29.900
Oh, Mandy,
How I've Missed This.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.100
I Know You Two Sent
That Picture Around,

12:32.200 --> 12:33.300
And I Just Want To Say-

12:33.300 --> 12:36.400
Betty, We Are So Glad
You Finally Found A Rebound Guy.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.000
- I Mean, You And Henry?
- Mismatch

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
One Time I Saw Him Changing
His Shirt In The Bathroom,

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
And I Wasn't Staring,

12:42.000 --> 12:43.600
And I Definitely
Did Not Take A Picture,

12:43.600 --> 12:47.600
<I>But For A Nerd Accountant,
He Has Body Karate.</I>

12:47.800 --> 12:50.700
Ooh.
But Gio Smells Like Salami.

12:50.700 --> 12:54.900
- And He's Perfect For You!
- Gio Is Not My Rebound Guy,

12:54.900 --> 12:56.700
And I Have An Article
To Write Today,

12:56.700 --> 12:58.100
So I Don't
Have Time For Your Games.

12:58.100 --> 13:01.100
If You Could Just Write
A Retraction E-Mail,

13:01.100 --> 13:03.500
- Send It Out-
- Betty, Gio Loves You.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.300
And That's A Direct Quote From
The Stall In The Men's Room.

13:06.700 --> 13:07.600
Oh.

13:07.900 --> 13:09.600
Now For The November Cover,

13:09.600 --> 13:12.400
I Was Thinking
We'd Be A Little Bit More Bold.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.600
Ladies, Gentlemen,
I Give You...

13:17.100 --> 13:17.900
The W-

13:19.000 --> 13:21.200
The War Iss-The War Issue.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.800
Sexy Soldiers
Surrounded By Danger.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.400
Definitely Gonna Keep
The Focus On Fashion,

13:25.400 --> 13:28.100
But, Uh, With A Bit More
Political Edge, As Well.

13:28.100 --> 13:31.000
I Don't Know.
It Seems A Little Too Risky.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.400
- I Think It's Fantastic.
- You Don't Get To Talk.

13:33.400 --> 13:38.200
- Uh, Wait, Uh, You Think It's Good? 
- I Think It's Genius.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.700
In Fact, It's So Genius

13:39.700 --> 13:41.600
That "Elle" Is Doing
The Exact Same Thing,

13:41.600 --> 13:43.100
Uh, A Month Earlier,

13:43.700 --> 13:46.600
But I'm Sure You've Got
Some Terrific Backup Ideas.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.900
Yeah. Yes, I Do.
Of Course.

13:50.900 --> 13:52.500
Um, We Could...

13:55.700 --> 13:56.700
The...

13:58.700 --> 14:00.500
Backup Ideas For The Cover...

14:00.600 --> 14:02.000
We're Thinkin', Uh,
We Might...

14:11.000 --> 14:13.200
Um... Yeah.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.400
Uh, C-W-Why Don't We,
Uh, Just Take Five Minutes?

14:17.500 --> 14:19.500
Uh, I'll Be Right Back.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.500
Get It Together, Daniel.
Come On.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.900
Aren't You Supposed
To Be In A Meeting?

14:34.600 --> 14:37.000
Wilhelmina Is In There,
And She Is Freaking Me Out.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.400
What Are You Doing
In The Men's Room?

14:39.600 --> 14:41.800
Ugh. There Was
A Graffiti Situation.

14:41.900 --> 14:44.600
Marc Wrote A Very Raunchy Poem
About Me And Gio.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.800
It Was More Of A Haiku, Really.
Anyway, I Took Care Of It.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.500
Shouldn't You Be Writing
Your Article?

14:49.900 --> 14:51.100
How Do You Know About That?

14:53.500 --> 14:54.300
Daniel?

14:54.800 --> 14:57.400
Did You Tell Your Mother
To Give Me That Article?

14:57.600 --> 14:59.600
I Know I'm Self-Involved,
But Even I Could Tell

14:59.600 --> 15:00.900
You Needed Some Cheering Up...

15:00.900 --> 15:04.800
- And Besides, You're Gonna Do Great.
- Great? I Haven't Written Anything Yet.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.800
I've Had A Few Distractions.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.500
Well, Stop That. Get Back
In There And Start Writing.

15:10.500 --> 15:13.100
Fine. You Get Back In There
And Run That Meeting,

15:13.100 --> 15:17.300
- And Don't Let Wilhelmina Get To You. 
- Yeah. We Can Do This.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.400
Yes, We Can.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.100
Uh, That Was Unexpected.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.900
Yeah. Let's Pretend That
That Didn't Happen.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.500
- Here You Go. Oh, Hey, Hilda. 
- Hi.

15:32.500 --> 15:33.300
What Brings You By?

15:33.300 --> 15:36.300
Oh, Yeah, I Was Just Doing
A P.T.A. Thing This Morning.

15:36.300 --> 15:39.200
I'm Really Big On Volunteering.
Anything For The Kids.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.400
Anyway, I Got
Turned Around In Here.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.100
This Place Is Like A Maze.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.200
Didn't You Go Here?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.500
You're So Funny.

15:47.600 --> 15:51.600
So What's Up, Tony?
What's Shakin'? What's New?

15:51.800 --> 15:53.600
Just P.E.

15:54.200 --> 15:58.300
Fun. Fun.
I Love Sports, You Know?

15:58.300 --> 15:59.800
Too Bad There's Not
A Big Game On Tonight,

15:59.800 --> 16:02.800
'Cause I Got Nothing To Do.
Nothing. Nothing At All.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.500
We're Short A Chaperone
For The School Dance. I...

16:06.500 --> 16:10.900
Yeah, I Could Do That, Totally.
Anything For The Kids, You Know?

16:11.000 --> 16:13.900
- Why Didn't You Tell Me There Was A Dance? 
- I'm Not Going.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.000
It's Tacky, And Everyone Dresses
Like They're Going To A Hayride.

16:18.400 --> 16:21.000
Of Course
He's Going To The Dance.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.300
He's Always Dancing.

16:22.300 --> 16:23.600
We Got Kicked Out
Of Church Once

16:23.600 --> 16:27.200
- 'Cause He Was Doing The Funky Chicken. 
- Never In My Life Have I Done 
The Funky Chicken.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.400
- Zip It. 
- So I'll See You Both Tonight Then?

16:29.400 --> 16:33.200
Yeah. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. See
You Tonight. No. No. Mnh-Mnh.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.000
God Bless You.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.800
<I>Oh, No. God Bless You, Coach.
God Bless You.</I>

16:37.900 --> 16:39.200
I'll Get Right On It,
Ms. Slater.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.700
All Right. Let's Talk Cover...
What's Going On?

16:42.700 --> 16:44.700
Wilhelmina Just Pitched
A Great Concept.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.700
- What? 
- Well, It's Just A Takeoff On Your Idea.

16:47.900 --> 16:50.700
Instead Of Doing The War Issue,
We're Doing The Peace Issue.

16:50.700 --> 16:53.500
That's Not A Takeoff On My Idea.
That's The Exact Opposite.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.300
Daniel, Give Peace A Chance.

17:01.700 --> 17:03.800
What About Not Making Decisions
Without Each Other?

17:03.800 --> 17:05.099
What About Two Against One?

17:05.099 --> 17:06.800
- You Left The Meeting.
- I-

17:06.800 --> 17:09.800
I've Got 20 Other Magazines
To Supervise, Including Mom's,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.800
Which Is Going To Tank Unless
She Gets Some Advertisers.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.300
Look, It's Starting Again.
Wilhelmina Is Taking Over.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.200
It Was Just One Idea.

17:18.700 --> 17:19.900
Stop Being Paranoid.

17:24.099 --> 17:26.400
<I>Oh, Great Bracelet.
J'adore.</I>

17:26.400 --> 17:27.200
Oh, Thank You.

17:33.300 --> 17:34.400
<I>The Big Story Of The Day</I>

17:34.400 --> 17:36.300
<I>Was Wilhelmina Slater's
Triumphant Return</I>

17:36.300 --> 17:37.700
<I>To "Mode" Magazine,</I>

17:37.900 --> 17:40.500
<I>Where She Greeted
Her Former Rival Daniel Meade</I>

17:40.500 --> 17:41.600
<I>With A Hug.</I>

17:42.600 --> 17:46.700
<I>Hmm. Uncomfortable.
Threatened Much, Daniel?</I>

17:46.700 --> 17:48.300
She Leaked That Photo!

17:48.300 --> 17:50.000
<I>Looks Like Someone Is Afraid
The Diva Will Return "Mode"</I>

17:50.000 --> 17:53.600
<I>- To Its Former Glory. 
- What? "Former Glory"? 
Can You Believe This?</I>

17:53.700 --> 17:54.900
Now If "Mode" Does Well,
They're Gonna Think

17:54.900 --> 17:57.400
- It's 'Cause Of Wilhelmina?
- Oh, My God.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.400
What Do You Mean,
"Oh, My God"?

17:58.400 --> 17:59.500
This Is The Part
Where You Usually Tell Me,

17:59.500 --> 18:04.000
- "Daniel, You're Being Crazy." 
- I Know, I Know, But-But That 
Kind Of Makes Sense.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.600
I Mean, I-I Can Totally See
Why You're Worried.

18:07.100 --> 18:10.800
- Is There Something I Should Do? 
- You Know What?

18:11.900 --> 18:13.800
Go Home. I Want You
To Work On That Article.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.800
I'm Gonna Handle This.
If She Wants To Spin The Press,

18:16.800 --> 18:18.500
Then We Are Gonna
Spin The Press.

18:18.700 --> 18:20.100
<I>...The Official Announcement,</I>

18:20.100 --> 18:22.100
<I>But I'll Be Happy
To Answer Any Questions.</I>

18:28.500 --> 18:30.000
Just Give Me
One Minute, All Right?

18:30.500 --> 18:31.600
Marc,
What Are You Doing Here?

18:31.600 --> 18:33.500
Just Wanted To See You
In Your Element.

18:33.500 --> 18:36.100
- Ooh, Pastries.
- Crafty Is For Talent Only.

18:36.100 --> 18:37.200
That's Short
For "Craft Services,"

18:37.200 --> 18:39.800
Which Is Long For "Food."
I'm Sorry. It's Industry Lingo.

18:39.900 --> 18:42.900
- Now, Uh, Just Get Out Of Here.
- Why? Why Can't I Be On The Show?

18:42.900 --> 18:46.500
<I>It's Not Me.
I Want You On The Show.</I>

18:46.500 --> 18:47.500
Oh, Yeah.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.800
It's, Um-It's Gene.
He Hates The Gays.

18:50.900 --> 18:53.500
- No.
- Yes. Okay. Now, Um, Please.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.100
It Would Be So Much Easier
For Me If You Just Left.

18:55.100 --> 18:58.300
Hey, You And I Come
As A Package...

18:58.400 --> 19:00.400
So He Is Just Gonna Have
To Get Used To It.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.600
- Gene Simmons?
- Yeah.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.700
I'm Marc St. James,

19:02.700 --> 19:04.200
Amanda's Best Friend
In The Whole Wide World.

19:04.200 --> 19:08.000
I'm Here, I'm Queer
And I'm Eating Your Pastries.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.300
You're Funny.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.000
You Know, We Could Use
A Funny Gay Guy

19:12.000 --> 19:15.600
- In Our Next Segment. Uh,
Wanna Be On The Show? 
- Yes.

19:16.300 --> 19:19.300
- This Is Fabulous.
- Thank You.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.000
What I Was Thinking-

19:21.000 --> 19:22.700
What? Tell Me.
Please, I'd Love To Hear It.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.200
How You Doing Over There?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.400
I Can't Concentrate.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.300
Why? Is It Henry Again?

19:34.400 --> 19:36.300
I Keep Trying
To Focus On My Work,

19:37.900 --> 19:39.500
And Then Gio Went
And Kissed Me.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.600
<I>What?
Gio Kissed You?</I>

19:41.600 --> 19:44.400
Girl, Spill It!
Can He Kiss?

19:44.400 --> 19:46.200
Don't Get Excited.
It Was Awful...

19:46.200 --> 19:48.000
- Ooh.
- And I Feel Guilty.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.700
Guilty? Why?

19:50.200 --> 19:52.500
Because You Liked It.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.100
No, I Just Miss Henry.
That's All.

19:54.100 --> 19:56.800
And-And I'm Not Even Close

19:56.800 --> 19:58.500
To Being Ready
To Think About Another Guy.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.800
It's Not Time Yet.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.500
Is It?
Oh, God, I'm Terrible.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.200
<I>Ay, Please. You Think
You Can't Have Feelings</I>

20:04.200 --> 20:05.700
For More Than One Guy
At A Time?

20:06.100 --> 20:08.800
I Know You Lost Henry,
But You Cannot Plan

20:08.800 --> 20:11.200
When You're Gonna Start
Feeling Things Again.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.600
Big Man On Campus
Coming Through.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.300
It's An Homage To "Grease."

20:18.100 --> 20:19.400
Danny Zuko Meets Couture.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.600
If I'm Going
To This Tacky Thing,

20:20.600 --> 20:23.800
<I>- I'll At Least Make A Splash.
- Papi, Will You Get Out Of Here</I>

20:23.800 --> 20:25.600
Before You Get
The Rest Of Us Sick?

20:25.600 --> 20:29.100
- You're Already Sick. 
- I Am Not. You Are Crazy. I'm Fine.

20:29.100 --> 20:31.300
But Is It, Like,
1,000 Degrees In Here Or What?

20:31.900 --> 20:32.300
Ow.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.600
Hilda, You're Burning Up.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.400
- There Is No Way You're Going To That Dance. 
- No, Tonight Is The Night

20:37.400 --> 20:38.800
That I Find Out
If The Coach Likes Me.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.300
<I>So Help Me God,
I Am Going To That Dance.</I>

20:41.300 --> 20:44.200
- You Want All Those Kids To Get Your Cold? 
- To Hell With The Kids.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.600
- Hilda!
- What?

20:45.600 --> 20:46.800
Besides, If I Don't Go,

20:46.800 --> 20:49.700
Then They're Gonna Be Short
A Chaperone. Please. Mm.

20:52.600 --> 20:53.500
I'll Go.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.300
What?

20:55.900 --> 20:58.000
I'll Go. I'll Be Surrounded
By Kids All Night.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.300
I Can Interview Them. I'll Get
Their Youth Perspective.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.900
I'll Build My Article Around
Their Quotes. It's Perfect.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.100
I Can't Concentrate
Around Here Anyway.

21:05.100 --> 21:08.600
<I>- Do I Still Have To Go? 
- Yes.
Because You Gotta Spy On The Coach.</I>

21:08.600 --> 21:10.400
- Hilda.
- I'm Gonna Go Get Ready.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.700
I Think I Still Have
My Homecoming Dress.

21:13.100 --> 21:16.300
No Velour Or Lace
Or Paisley.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
Better Go Up There.

21:20.900 --> 21:21.600
Here.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.200
<I>Oh, Thanks, Papi.</I>

21:25.200 --> 21:26.400
You Know,

21:26.900 --> 21:29.300
From The First Moment
I Looked Into Your Eyes,

21:29.300 --> 21:31.500
It Was Like Some Kind
Of Cosmic Connection.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.700
I- I Don't Know What It Is,
But, You Know,

21:32.700 --> 21:35.500
I Knew You Were My Daughter.
Happiest Day Of My Life.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.300
Gene, Do You Mean That?
I Really Do.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.200
Stand By.
We Have Sound Problems.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.800
Oh. Reset, Everybody. Back In Ten.

21:43.800 --> 21:44.800
No, It's-It's Okay.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.500
Um, Hey, Tell Me
About My Mom.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.400
Can I Have A Water? Asap.
Hello? Yes, Mr. Simmons.

21:49.400 --> 21:53.100
Hey, Uh, Did, Uh, Did She Ever Contact
You? I'm So Sorry. I've Got To Get This.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.500
Hello. Brian.

21:58.900 --> 21:59.800
That Was Weird.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.600
<I>Oh, No.
That's Classic Gene.</I>

22:01.700 --> 22:04.400
He's Always On His Phone.
It's Kind Of A Celebrity Thing.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.200
You Wouldn't Really Understand It. H
- He Was So Sweet When The Cameras Were On,

22:07.200 --> 22:09.100
And Then He Did, Like,
A Complete 180.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.400
What Do You Mean? 180? It
Means, Like, Complete Opposite.

22:11.500 --> 22:14.500
No, I Know What 180 Means.
Are You Trying To Say

22:14.600 --> 22:17.100
That What My Father
And I Have Isn't Real?

22:17.200 --> 22:19.900
This Is Exactly Why
I Didn't Want You To Come Here.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.600
You-You Are So Jealous
That I'm Rock Royalty.

22:24.700 --> 22:26.300
Well, What Are You?

22:53.700 --> 22:58.000
Oh, My God. Look At This Place,
All The Decorations.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.900
Yeah, It's Still The Gym.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.900
It's Like Putting Lipstick
On A Pig.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.900
Okay, So I Guess
I Should Start Getting Quotes.

23:04.900 --> 23:06.600
Are You Ready To Have Fun?

23:06.700 --> 23:09.500
Yeah, But We're Here.
I'm Gonna Go Find The Coach.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.500
Okay.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.400
Hi, Uh, Could-

23:14.900 --> 23:17.200
Excuse Me, Do You Have
A Second? I Just-

23:17.400 --> 23:19.800
* I Could Make You Excited *

23:19.900 --> 23:21.400
Excuse Me. Hi.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.600
I'm Writing An Article
For A Magazine

23:23.700 --> 23:25.200
On The Youth Perspective.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.700
As A Young Woman,

23:26.800 --> 23:30.100
What Do You Think
About The Older Generations?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.700
You Know, Like, What Would You Say
To Somebody Who Was 60?

23:33.700 --> 23:35.100
Like You?

23:36.800 --> 23:38.800
Um, Okay.

23:39.100 --> 23:40.300
Let's Try This
A Different Way.

23:40.300 --> 23:42.600
I Know You From Somewhere.
Nope. I Don't Think So.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.900
Yeah, Braces.
You Know My Brother.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.400
Who's Your Brother?

23:53.300 --> 23:54.500
I Knew You Were Stalking Me.

23:54.500 --> 23:58.000
<I>You Are Stalking Me. What Are
You Doing Here? I'm A Chaperone.</I>

23:58.100 --> 24:00.300
Well, Me, Too,
But I'm Also Working,

24:00.300 --> 24:02.100
So If You Don't Mind...

24:02.200 --> 24:05.100
Oh, I See. You Get Your Kiss,
And Now You're Blowing Me Off.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.600
<I>You Kissed Me. Yeah,
Well, You Kissed Me Back.</I>

24:07.700 --> 24:10.100
I Even Felt Your Tongue.
I Was Blocking Your Tongue.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.800
You Frenched Me, Suarez.
You Frenched Me Good.

24:12.800 --> 24:14.600
I Did Not French You.

24:21.600 --> 24:24.200
Gio, I Have An Article
That I Need To Write,

24:24.300 --> 24:27.600
And My Deadline Is Tomorrow,
So Please Stop Distracting Me.

24:27.600 --> 24:31.000
What? I'm Chaperoning Here.

24:31.900 --> 24:34.150
And Who Calls It "Frenching"?

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Hello?

24:37.100 --> 24:39.500
Is He There? The Coach?
Yeah.

24:39.500 --> 24:43.000
He's Talking To Miss Kazlauskas,
The Social Studies Teacher. "Miss"?

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
Is She Young? Is She Pretty?
Is She Prettier Than Me?

24:46.100 --> 24:48.500
Uh, No Competish.
She Has A Lazy Eye.

24:48.600 --> 24:52.000
Ooh. Tough Break For Her,
But Yay For Us.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.800
So Are You Saying That
The Return Of Wilhelmina Slater

24:54.800 --> 24:57.700
Is Not Going To Affect
Things At "Mode" At All?

24:57.800 --> 24:59.000
Well, No, It's Irrelevant.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.500
As Far As The Magazine
Is Concerned,

25:00.500 --> 25:04.500
Wilhelmina Is Back In Name Only. Let's
Take Some Calls. Uh, Burlington, Vermont,

25:04.600 --> 25:06.800
You're On The Air
With Daniel Meade.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.300
Hi.
Uh, I Wanna Know,

25:08.400 --> 25:10.800
Why Don't You Give
Wilhelmina Slater Some Credit?

25:10.800 --> 25:13.200
Isn't That A Little Sexist?
Oh, No. Not At All.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.500
I'm-I'm Just Here Trying
To Set The Record Straight.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.900
Well, What About The Photo Where
You Were Shoving Her? Wait A Minute.

25:18.900 --> 25:21.450
Do We-Do We Have
That Photo In The System?

25:21.800 --> 25:23.200
Uh, It's Actually Not Me, Uh
- Wait A Minute. Wait A Minute, Daniel.

25:23.200 --> 25:26.300
There It I-Whoa. You Are
Really Shoving Her There.

25:26.300 --> 25:28.100
Uh, Do You Have Problems
With Successfu Women,

25:28.200 --> 25:31.400
Or Just Women Who Don't Want
To Sleep With You?

25:31.800 --> 25:34.300
Oh, I Know What This Is.
It's Wilhelmina's Assistant

25:34.300 --> 25:36.300
Putting On A Female Voice.
I'm Sorry.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.200
It Sounds Like A Girl.
Thank You, Larry.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.400
You're Welcome.
Uh, Isn't It Also True,

25:40.400 --> 25:42.500
Wilhelmina Put In
20 Years Of Hard Work

25:42.500 --> 25:45.700
While You Got Your Job Through
Nepotism? Fair Question.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.700
No.
It Wasn't Nepotism.

25:47.700 --> 25:51.149
My Father Gave Me The Job.
That's Not What I Meant To Say.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.500
I, Um, I Deserved It.

25:52.600 --> 25:55.400
And This Call Is A Fake.
It's Marc From My Office.

25:55.400 --> 25:58.400
And Wilhelmina Is
A Backstabbing, Conniving,

25:58.400 --> 25:59.800
Vicious Little-
Now, Daniel, Wait A Minute.

25:59.900 --> 26:05.000
<I>My Producer Says That This Call
Is Coming From Vermont.</I>

26:07.300 --> 26:10.900
Beautiful Foliage,
Uh, Up There.

26:12.300 --> 26:12.900
Question-

26:12.900 --> 26:15.400
What Kind Of Colorful Phrases
Are Kids Using These Days?

26:15.400 --> 26:19.100
Is It Still "Bling-Bling"
Or Is It Just One "Bling" Or...

26:29.400 --> 26:30.400
Whoa.

26:30.400 --> 26:31.800
He'll Be Back.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.900
I Need Your Help. Oh, I
Thought I Was Distracting You.

26:34.900 --> 26:37.600
I Don't Have A Single Quote
For My Article,

26:37.700 --> 26:40.000
Not One Without Profanity,
Anyway.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.900
I Literally Have
Kids Running From Me,

26:42.000 --> 26:44.700
And You Are Surrounded By Them.
How Do You Do It?

26:44.700 --> 26:47.200
I Just Talk To Them
Like A Normal Person.

26:47.300 --> 26:49.700
They're Pretty Much The Same
As Everybody You Know.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.900
I Mean, Look.
There's A Daniel.

26:54.500 --> 26:57.200
And, Uh, There's An Amanda.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.200
Oh, That Kid
Is Definitely Me.

27:02.300 --> 27:03.900
Ugh! I Hate That Little Kid!

27:04.000 --> 27:06.900
I Busted Him Twice Tonight
For Defacing Posters.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Yeah.

27:08.400 --> 27:11.000
And Now We Know Who You Were
In Junior High School-

27:11.100 --> 27:12.900
The Girl Who Never
Had Any Fun.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.850
Um, I Had Plenty Of Fun.

27:15.850 --> 27:16.400
Yeah.

27:16.400 --> 27:21.000
I Did Yearbook And, Uh,
Young Environmentalists

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
And-And Multicultural Club,

27:23.000 --> 27:24.300
<I>And, You Know,
I Don't Like To Brag,</I>

27:24.400 --> 27:28.300
But In Eighth Grade, I Did Win
The Good Citizen Award.

27:28.400 --> 27:31.700
Of Course You Have A Good Citizen
Award. Well, I Don't Technically Have It.

27:31.800 --> 27:34.000
I Gave It Back So That Everyone
At The School Could Enjoy It,

27:34.100 --> 27:34.800
Which Kind Of Sucks,

27:34.800 --> 27:36.300
Because I Worked Really Hard
For That Award,

27:36.300 --> 27:38.900
And Now I Can Barely See It
Through The Trophy Case,

27:39.000 --> 27:39.900
But That's Okay,

27:39.900 --> 27:42.900
Because Giving Back
Is What A Good Citizen Does.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.600
Oh, Found Her-
Little Betty.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.300
She Must Be Covering This Thing
For The School Paper.

27:52.600 --> 27:53.600
No.

27:55.900 --> 27:58.500
She's Waiting For Someone
To Ask Her To Dance.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.600
Okay, I'll Try Again...

28:08.400 --> 28:09.800
Your Way.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.300
I'll Talk To Her
Like A Normal Person.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.300
I Have Heard

28:19.300 --> 28:21.700
That Your Advertising Problems
Haven't Gotten Any Better.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.700
May I Suggest
- I'm Really Not Interested In Your Opinion.

28:24.700 --> 28:26.900
You Would Sabotage Me
In A Heartbeat.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.100
Ancient History, Claire.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.000
Why Don't You Just Say
What You're Going To Say And Go?

28:30.000 --> 28:33.600
Have You Ever Considered Giving
Away Your Advertising For Free?

28:34.200 --> 28:36.800
<I>Why Would I Possibly Do That?</I>

28:36.900 --> 28:38.900
Because Advertisers
Are Like Sheep-

28:39.000 --> 28:40.900
You Give Free Space
To One "It" Brand

28:40.900 --> 28:42.200
In Exchange For A Promise

28:42.200 --> 28:44.000
That They Don't Tell
Anyone Else It's Free,

28:44.000 --> 28:45.500
And All Of The Sudden,
You've Landed A Big Account,

28:45.500 --> 28:47.200
You're Legit
And All The Other Buyers

28:47.200 --> 28:50.700
Are Willing To Pay Top Dollar To Be In
Your Magazine. 

28:51.500 --> 28:52.700
Why Are You Helping Me?

28:52.700 --> 28:55.600
Because I Have A Real Stake
In This Company Now. Ah.

28:55.700 --> 28:58.900
Your Failure Is
One-Third My Failure.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Ah.

29:03.100 --> 29:04.800
Good Luck, Claire.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.900
Hey, Gene.
Yeah.

29:11.300 --> 29:12.900
I'm Really Upset.

29:12.900 --> 29:14.800
I Just Had
This Huge Fight With Marc,

29:14.800 --> 29:16.800
And I Feel Terrible.
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

29:16.800 --> 29:19.700
Are You About To-
Are You About To Start Crying?

29:19.800 --> 29:21.800
That's Great.
Just Hold That Thought.

29:21.900 --> 29:25.100
Hey, Pal, Do Me A Favor. Would You Come Over
- No, No, No. Please, Please No Cameras.

29:25.100 --> 29:27.800
Come On. I- I Really Just
Need A Father-Daughter Moment,

29:27.800 --> 29:28.800
One-On-One.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.100
Okay. Okay. Calm Down.
Yeah.

29:31.100 --> 29:33.400
Excuse Me? Can You Get
That Camera Over Here Right Now?

29:33.400 --> 29:36.000
Hurry Up. Be Right There, Mr. Simmons.

29:36.100 --> 29:38.200
Gene, What Happened
To Your Tattoo?

29:39.600 --> 29:41.400
It Looks Fake.

29:45.100 --> 29:48.100
Gene,
Are You My Father Or Not?

29:48.600 --> 29:49.900
Um...

29:56.000 --> 29:58.100
What Are You
Looking Forward To Most?

29:58.200 --> 30:00.900
Graduation.
This One Goes Out
To Betty From Gio.

30:00.900 --> 30:01.700
All Right, Kids,

30:01.700 --> 30:05.200
Grab That Special Someone
And Hit The Dance Floor.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.800
So What Do You Say, B.?

30:08.800 --> 30:09.900
Do You Wanna
Do Something Crazy

30:09.900 --> 30:12.200
And Actually Dance
At A School Dance?

30:14.200 --> 30:17.600
Aw, Don't Worry About Her.
I've Got That Covered.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.100
Do You Wanna Dance?

30:22.700 --> 30:24.200
I Don't Know.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.400
Go. Have Fun.

30:33.300 --> 30:34.600
Well, That Was Very Nice.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.100
Come On.
Take A Break From Your Article.

30:37.100 --> 30:39.200
<I>* Always In Time *</I>

30:39.200 --> 30:43.000
<I>* But Never In Line For Dreams *</I>

30:43.000 --> 30:45.100
<I>* Head Over Heels *</I>

30:45.100 --> 30:48.000
<I>* When Toe-To-Toe *</I>

30:48.000 --> 30:52.900
<I>* This Is The Sound Of My Soul *</I>

30:52.900 --> 30:57.100
<I>* This Is The Sound *</I>

30:57.100 --> 31:01.900
<I>* Always Slipping From My Hands *</I>

31:01.900 --> 31:06.000
<I>* Sets A Time Of Its Own *</I>

31:06.000 --> 31:11.400
<I>* Oh, I Want The Truth To Be Said *</I>

31:12.300 --> 31:13.500
I Can't.

31:13.500 --> 31:17.500
<I>* Huh, Huh, Huh, Hu-Uh, Huh</I>

31:17.500 --> 31:23.500
<I>* I Know This Much Is True *</I>

31:28.300 --> 31:29.300
Hey.

31:30.900 --> 31:32.900
Oh, I'm Fine. How Are You?

31:33.200 --> 31:34.700
I'm Good.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.800
You Realize I Didn't
Actually Ask, "How Are You?"

31:37.900 --> 31:40.000
Oh, I'm Fine.
Thanks.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.200
You're Really Good
At Hiding It.

31:49.500 --> 31:50.500
Yeah.

31:52.100 --> 31:53.600
It's Just,
I'm Not The Type Of Person

31:53.600 --> 31:56.150
Who Can Have A Boyfriend
And Forget About Them...

31:58.100 --> 32:00.200
Especially Someone I Love.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Loved.

32:04.300 --> 32:06.750
What Am I Doing
Dancing With You, Gio?

32:08.100 --> 32:10.000
What Does That Say
About Me?

32:10.100 --> 32:12.850
God, Betty,
It Must Be So Exhausting...

32:14.100 --> 32:16.800
Always Worrying
About The Right Thing To Do.

32:16.900 --> 32:18.200
What Do You Mean?

32:18.200 --> 32:20.400
Didn't You Give Back
Your Good Citizen Award

32:20.400 --> 32:23.150
Because That's
What A Good Citizen Does?

32:24.500 --> 32:26.200
And Maybe
You Should Stop Worrying

32:26.200 --> 32:28.600
About How
You're Supposed To Be,

32:28.700 --> 32:31.100
And Just... Be.

32:36.100 --> 32:37.900
I'm Really Sad.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.700
Well, Sad I Think
We Can Work With.

32:50.300 --> 32:52.500
Talk To Me. I Don't Know What Happened.

32:52.500 --> 32:53.900
Coach Was Standing
By The Bleachers,

32:53.900 --> 32:55.000
And Then He Disappeared.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
<I>I May Have Left My Post Briefly To
Dance. You Know What, Sweetie? I Am Sorry.</I>

32:59.200 --> 33:02.100
I've Been Bugging You All Night.
Go Have Fun.

33:02.100 --> 33:04.000
Mom, You Aren't Bugging Me.

33:04.100 --> 33:06.200
I'm Really Glad You Found
Someone You Like Again.

33:06.200 --> 33:08.500
Oh, Thank You, Sweetie,

33:08.600 --> 33:10.100
But Obviously,
This Wasn't Meant To Be,

33:10.100 --> 33:13.900
So I'll Just See You
When You Get Home, Okay?

33:14.000 --> 33:14.700
Bye.

33:14.700 --> 33:16.500
Okay. Bye.

33:25.100 --> 33:26.400
<I>* I'm High-Class *</I>

33:26.400 --> 33:28.600
<I>* I Ain't No Trailer Trash *</I>

33:28.600 --> 33:31.400
<I>* I'm High-Class,
I Ain't No Trailer Trash *</I>

33:31.400 --> 33:32.800
Oh, Hey, Justin.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.700
Hey, Um, My Mom Would
Kill Me For Doing This,

33:35.700 --> 33:38.150
But She Wants To Know
If You Like Her.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.900
If I Like Her?
Yeah.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.300
What Is This, Junior High?

33:42.300 --> 33:46.259
Actually, Yes,
And She Totally Likes You.

33:46.260 --> 33:47.060
Actually, Yes,
And She Totally Likes You.

33:51.100 --> 33:53.500
Over My Dead Body.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.500
Mom, I'm Sorry. It's Done.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.100
Uh, What's Going On Here?

33:57.900 --> 34:00.200
Go Ahead.
Tell Your Brother.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.100
I Reinstated Wilhelmina
As Creative Director Of "Mode."

34:03.100 --> 34:05.900
What? Do You Know How Much Easier
It Was Having Her Around Today?

34:05.900 --> 34:07.800
I Mean,
She Saved Your Cover.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.199
She Helped Save "Hot Flash"
In Under A Minute.

34:10.300 --> 34:15.900
She's The Best In The Business. And She's
A Ruthless, Immoral, Ambitious Snake.

34:15.900 --> 34:20.000
That's What Makes Her So Good. What Happened
To Not Making Any Moves Without Each Other?

34:20.000 --> 34:21.600
Like You Going
On National Television

34:21.600 --> 34:23.600
Making An Ass Out Of Yourself
And This Magazine?

34:23.600 --> 34:26.000
This Is Damage Control.
You're Making A Huge Mistake.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.500
No, I'm Making
A Tough Decision,

34:27.500 --> 34:29.800
Which Is My Job
As President Of This Company.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.600
This Discussion's Over.

34:37.100 --> 34:39.100
I Can't Steal
My Good Citizen Trophy.

34:39.100 --> 34:41.400
Oh, Come On.
You Know You Want To.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.400
It'll Make You Feel Better,
I Promise.

34:43.500 --> 34:47.500
Okay. Yep. There It Is.
I Can See It Kind Of.

34:47.600 --> 34:49.500
All Right. Maybe I Could
Just Hold It For A Second,

34:49.600 --> 34:50.600
And Then Put It Back.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.500
Or You Could Take A Picture
Of Me With Your Cell Phone.

34:52.500 --> 34:54.500
No, No.
That Could Be Evidence.

35:01.500 --> 35:02.800
"Betty, Come Get Me.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.500
You Worked So Hard.
I Belong To You."

35:04.600 --> 35:07.600
Shh. My Trophy Speaks
With A Mexican Accent?

35:07.600 --> 35:09.000
All Trophies Do.

35:11.600 --> 35:12.600
Okay.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.200
Oh, My God.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.700
Oh, My God. Oh, My God.
Oh, My God. I Got It.

35:25.800 --> 35:28.400
I Got It. It's A Lot Lighter
Than I Imagined.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.800
Stop Right There.

35:32.100 --> 35:33.200
Principal Hayward.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.700
Betty Suarez?

35:35.300 --> 35:36.300
Stealing?

35:38.600 --> 35:41.000
You're A Bad Citizen,
Betty Suarez.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.400
Wilhelmina.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.800
Alexis May Be Onboard With You
And Your Little Act,

35:53.000 --> 35:55.500
But I Am Not. I Haven't
Forgotten Who You Are.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.400
Really, Daniel? Who Am I?

35:57.400 --> 36:00.000
This Morning,
I Was Nothing At All,

36:00.100 --> 36:01.900
This Evening,
I'm Creative Director,

36:01.900 --> 36:03.000
And Tomorrow, Who Knows?

36:03.000 --> 36:06.250
Maybe
I'll Be Editor-In-Chief.

36:07.000 --> 36:10.100
Oh, Wait, That's Your Job,

36:10.200 --> 36:11.400
Isn't It?

36:12.100 --> 36:13.800
Sweet Dreams.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.900
Well, If It Isn't
Miss Fancy-Pants Celebrity

36:25.900 --> 36:27.200
Back Among The Muggles.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.300
Stop. Hey, If You're
Really Such A Celebrity,

36:29.300 --> 36:32.400
Then Where's Your Posse, Huh?
Where's Your Hybrid?

36:32.500 --> 36:34.800
Where's Your
Inappropriately Named Baby?

36:35.600 --> 36:37.000
I'm Sorry.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.500
I Was Mean.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.400
Look, If You Think
That You And Gene

36:40.500 --> 36:42.000
Have Such
A Great Relationship, Fine.

36:42.100 --> 36:46.500
It's None Of My Business. Marc, You Were Right. I Didn't Want You Around,

36:46.600 --> 36:48.800
'Cause I Didn't Want
You To See

36:48.900 --> 36:51.200
That He Only Loved Me
On Camera.

36:51.300 --> 36:54.900
It Wasn't Real.
He's Not Even My Father.

36:54.900 --> 36:56.100
What Do You Mean?

36:56.400 --> 36:58.500
It Was All A Publicity Stunt.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.500
He Needed A Gimmick
For His Reality Show,

37:01.500 --> 37:04.000
And I Was Just
A Gorgeous Ingenue

37:04.100 --> 37:05.700
Looking For A Dad.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.600
Well, I Didn't Want
To Say This Before,

37:09.700 --> 37:12.100
<I>But I Am So Relieved.</I>

37:12.200 --> 37:13.900
I Mean, Thank God
You're Not Related.

37:13.900 --> 37:14.700
In Ten Years,

37:14.700 --> 37:17.300
That Massive Forehead
Could Be You.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.600
You're Right.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.400
But I'm Sorry
You Still Don't Know

37:25.400 --> 37:27.300
Who Your Family Is.

37:31.900 --> 37:33.400
Yes, I Do.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.000
Who Is It?

37:42.000 --> 37:44.600
It's, Um, Tony Diaz.

37:46.100 --> 37:48.300
Oh. Oh, God.

37:48.300 --> 37:51.600
Just A Second, Okay?
I'll Be Right There.

37:51.600 --> 37:52.400
Okay.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.900
Oh, My God. Oh, God.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.900
Tony. Hi. How Are You?

37:58.900 --> 38:00.100
I'm Good.
Oh.

38:00.100 --> 38:02.500
Missed You At The Dance.
Heard You Had A Nasty Cold.

38:02.500 --> 38:05.400
Yeah, You Know, I Just Have
A Little Bit Of An...

38:07.800 --> 38:08.800
Ah.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.300
Tickle In My Throat.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.200
That Doesn't Sound Too Good. No.

38:13.200 --> 38:16.400
Here. I Brought You Some Soup. What?

38:18.200 --> 38:20.000
That Is So Nice.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
I Am So Embarrassed.
I Look Horrible.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.100
Oh, No, No, No,
What Are You-No.

38:25.200 --> 38:27.900
You-You Look Great.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.350
Do You Wanna, Um, Come In?

38:34.400 --> 38:36.500
Uh, I-I Think
I Should Get Going,

38:36.500 --> 38:39.400
But, You, Um,
You Feel Better Soon, Okay?

38:39.400 --> 38:41.300
Thanks For The Soup.

38:43.300 --> 38:44.900
Um, Whenever
You're Up To It,

38:44.900 --> 38:47.600
I Don't Know, Maybe We Could
Hang Out Sometime?

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
Yeah, I Would Like That.
Really?

38:51.100 --> 38:52.100
Yeah.

38:52.700 --> 38:53.500
Okay. Good.

38:53.500 --> 38:57.459
All Right. Enjoy The Soup.
Okay. Thank You.

38:57.460 --> 38:58.360
All Right. Enjoy The Soup.
Okay. Thank You.

39:01.100 --> 39:02.600
* He Likes Me *

39:02.600 --> 39:04.700
* He Really Li...*

39:07.100 --> 39:08.700
It's Only A Matter Of Time

39:08.800 --> 39:11.250
Before I Break
This Family Apart For Good.

39:11.500 --> 39:12.300
Wow. I Love This.

39:12.300 --> 39:14.850
You're Back
And Wilhelmeaner Than Ever.

39:15.200 --> 39:18.000
Well, I Couldn't Have Done It
Without Your Help.

39:18.100 --> 39:21.200
I Especially Liked The Caller
On Larry King From Vermont

39:21.200 --> 39:22.400
Putting Daniel
Through The Ringer.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.300
Well, He Is A Sexist Pig.

39:24.300 --> 39:26.500
Brilliant Move Getting
A Vermont Cell Phone.

39:26.600 --> 39:27.500
You Told Me To.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.500
Like I Said, Brilliant Move.

39:34.500 --> 39:36.600
So The Principal
Turns To Her And Says...

39:36.700 --> 39:40.150
"Betty Suarez, You're Expelled."

39:40.800 --> 39:42.300
No Way.
Badass.

39:42.300 --> 39:46.200
No, It Is Not Badass
To Get Expelled From School,

39:46.200 --> 39:47.700
So Don't Go Gettin'
Any Ideas.

39:47.700 --> 39:50.600
Too Late. You're Officially
A Bad Influence.

39:50.800 --> 39:52.600
Okay, It's Time For Us
To Go Inside.

39:52.600 --> 39:53.900
Your Mom's
Probably Waiting.

39:53.900 --> 39:55.800
All Right. Bye.
Bye.

39:56.400 --> 39:57.600
Wait Right Here.
I'm Gonna Go Say

39:57.600 --> 39:59.700
A Proper Good Night
To Betty, Okay?

40:04.600 --> 40:05.800
I'm Sorry
I Got You Into Trouble.

40:05.800 --> 40:08.100
Don't Worry
About It. I Had Fun.

40:08.100 --> 40:09.100
And Besides, I Figured Out

40:09.100 --> 40:10.900
What My Article's
Gonna Be About-

40:11.000 --> 40:13.200
"You Can Be Young
At Any Age."

40:13.300 --> 40:15.500
I Mean, I Just Had
My First Junior High Dance,

40:15.500 --> 40:18.200
And I'm 24.
I'm Glad I Could Help.

40:18.400 --> 40:22.300
Well, I Better Get Inside And Start
Writing. Right, Right. The Deadline.

40:22.700 --> 40:24.700
Yeah.
Good Luck.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.400
Thanks.

40:29.700 --> 40:33.000
Hey, Uh, Crazy Idea.

40:33.100 --> 40:35.200
Um, Do You Wanna,
Uh, Maybe,

40:35.300 --> 40:39.300
Uh, Do Something
Some-Sometime?

40:40.100 --> 40:41.900
What, Like-Like A Date?

40:42.600 --> 40:45.300
I Don't Know. Yeah.

40:48.300 --> 40:50.700
Betty, Um,
I Don't Think So.

40:50.800 --> 40:51.700
What?

40:51.700 --> 40:55.300
I Just-I Don't Think
It's A Good Idea.

40:55.400 --> 40:59.400
Um... Okay.
I'm A Little Confused.

40:59.400 --> 41:00.000
Um... Okay.
I'm A Little Confused.

41:00.100 --> 41:02.000
See, You Kissed Me,

41:02.000 --> 41:03.400
And Then
You Danced With Me,

41:03.400 --> 41:05.500
And You Talked About
Being My Rebound Guy,

41:05.500 --> 41:09.200
So I Mean,
What Was That All About?

41:09.300 --> 41:10.650
Well, That's Just It.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.500
I Don't Want To Be
The Rebound Guy.

41:15.100 --> 41:16.700
I Wanna Be The Guy.

41:18.400 --> 41:22.700
* And That Friend Is You *

41:22.700 --> 41:26.500
* Be Surprised By My Remarks *

41:30.200 --> 41:32.600
