Anybody want to meet
in the middle of this thing?

00:25.550 --> 00:28.268
No! Gene, I can't keep meeting

00:28.345 --> 00:29.519
We got to get through dinner.

I'm excited to go.

00:34.443 --> 00:36.610
Hey, it's their
one free concert night.

00:36.686 --> 00:39.488
If we miss it, we'd have to pay
to go, and we're not doing that.

00:39.564 --> 00:41.364
I still don't understand
why we're doing this at all.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.949
The symphony? Us?

00:43.026 --> 00:45.786
It's like giving a monkey
a monocle.

00:45.862 --> 00:48.213
Yeah, we're more like those
monkeys that wear sunglasses

00:48.290 --> 00:50.499
and ride motorcycles
and give people the finger.

00:50.575 --> 00:51.875
We are not
those types of monkeys,

to the symphony.

I told you, I was at
the vagina-cologist,

00:55.872 --> 00:58.381
in the waiting room,
reading that parenting magazine,

00:58.392 --> 01:00.383
<i> Modern Swaddlin',</i>
and it said you're supposed

01:00.394 --> 01:02.135
to play classical music
for babies

01:02.212 --> 01:04.346
to stimulate their brains
and stuff.

01:04.422 --> 01:05.680
We never exposed you
to any classical music

01:05.757 --> 01:07.057
when you were babies.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.141
Just a bunch of Billy Joel.

01:08.218 --> 01:10.185
You have baby Billy Joel brains.

01:10.262 --> 01:12.521
But you did expose us
to a lot of your "uptown girls."

01:12.597 --> 01:15.023
-Bosoms.
-Also, we're not babies anymore.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.025
And by the way,
I turned out perfect.

01:17.102 --> 01:18.911
And then there's Gene and Tina,
who are doing their best.

01:18.987 --> 01:20.320
Hi. Wait, what?

01:20.397 --> 01:22.197
Oh, really?
May I remind you all

01:22.274 --> 01:23.749
of your report cards
from last week?

01:23.826 --> 01:26.076
No, you may not.
Sorry, you can.

01:26.087 --> 01:29.412
Cs and Ds. A lot of Cs and Ds
in there. I don't like it.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.164
Well, how are we supposed to
concentrate at school anyway?

01:31.241 --> 01:34.251
We're in the middle
of a pinworm epidemic.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.087
There are pinworms crawling
through kids' stomachs,

01:37.098 --> 01:40.257
laying eggs in their anuses,
and I'm supposed to be able

01:40.267 --> 01:42.467
to think about
what two plus two equals?!

01:42.544 --> 01:43.602
Wait, is that what you're being
taught in math right now?

01:43.679 --> 01:45.053
Butt worms, Dad!

01:45.130 --> 01:46.930
That's what I'm being taught!

01:46.941 --> 01:48.440
And it's itchy,
and kids start scratching

01:48.517 --> 01:50.517
and spread the eggs everywhere!

01:50.594 --> 01:52.060
-Gross.
-Yeah.

01:52.137 --> 01:53.937
I mean, children are
basically disgusting.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.022
I know! Why did you have any?

01:56.099 --> 01:58.275
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.119
Well, hopefully everyone paid
attention to Mr. Frond's

02:00.195 --> 02:02.279
fun and informative
and slightly provocative

02:02.289 --> 02:03.956
handwashing assembly.

02:04.032 --> 02:05.457
Hello, Right Hand.

02:05.534 --> 02:07.951
Would you like to take
a shower with me?

02:07.962 --> 02:09.035
(high-pitched):
I would love to, Left Hand,

02:09.112 --> 02:11.130
but my cousin is
in town visiting.

02:11.206 --> 02:13.582
Can I bring him?
His name is Soap.

02:13.658 --> 02:15.208
(normal voice):
He's more than welcome.

02:15.285 --> 02:18.461
I think we're all gonna
get along just fine.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.806
-It was hot.
-So, let's get to it, kids.

02:20.883 --> 02:22.307
Come on, wash them
if you got them.

02:22.384 --> 02:24.476
No worms are hitching
a ride in these cabooses.

02:24.553 --> 02:26.478
It's not "cabooses,"
it's "cabeese."

02:26.555 --> 02:28.138
Okay, after the handwashing,

02:28.149 --> 02:29.931
everybody go get ready
real fast.

02:30.008 --> 02:31.266

02:31.343 --> 02:32.976

-Damn it.

Wheels up in 45 minutes, people!

02:37.399 --> 02:39.316
I don't know what that means,
but I heard it on TV,

02:39.326 --> 02:41.776
and I like the sound of it.
Holy moly!

02:41.853 --> 02:44.070
Did this get even bigger
while I was making dinner?

02:44.147 --> 02:47.616
Yeah, TV will be less fun now
that we can't see it anymore.

02:47.692 --> 02:49.451
What happened?
Did you mess it up?

02:49.527 --> 02:51.503
Kids, you know you can't leave
this thing here forever, right?

02:51.580 --> 02:53.288
This is our living room.

02:53.365 --> 02:55.123
But was this room
really living, hmm?

02:55.200 --> 02:56.508
What is it again?

02:56.585 --> 02:58.844
Um, it's a hamster slide,
obviously.

02:58.921 --> 03:00.420
But we don't have a hamster.

03:00.497 --> 03:02.422
Well, we didn't really need one
before the slide.

03:02.499 --> 03:05.517
I mean, I don't think hamsters
are supposed to go down slides.

03:05.594 --> 03:06.968
Especially like that.

03:07.045 --> 03:09.137
Oh, excuse us, Jane Goodall.

03:09.214 --> 03:10.972
Couldn't you just, like,
roll a marble down it?

03:11.049 --> 03:12.557
That would still be fun, right?

03:12.634 --> 03:14.359
-He really just doesn't get it.
-I know.

03:14.436 --> 03:15.977
Also, it's not
even finished yet.

03:16.054 --> 03:17.979
Our loop de loop
needs more loop.

03:18.056 --> 03:19.522
-Don't we all.
-Let's get loopy!

03:19.533 --> 03:21.274
No! No more hamster slide!

03:21.351 --> 03:23.109
-Go get ready, move!

03:23.186 --> 03:24.861
(singsongy):
Symphony!

03:24.896 --> 03:26.363
Hmm, what are we after here?

03:26.373 --> 03:28.949
Something nice
but not too flashy.

03:29.025 --> 03:30.158
No need for Glamour Tina.

03:30.235 --> 03:31.785
Unless... what if there's

03:31.861 --> 03:33.495
a handsome 15-year-old prodigy
up on stage?

03:33.571 --> 03:35.997
And our eyes meet, and he says,
"I sure could use

03:36.074 --> 03:37.958
some help warming up my lips
to play this oboe."

03:38.034 --> 03:39.626
And I go up there
and warm up his lips,

03:39.703 --> 03:41.378
and the audience is like,
"Oboe, you didn't."

03:41.388 --> 03:42.554
(chuckles)

03:42.631 --> 03:43.964
Ooh, this is perfect.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.215
Hmm, looks a little small.

03:45.226 --> 03:47.217
Boy, I am growing like a weed.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.219
Hey, what do you think
of my symphony voice?

03:49.230 --> 03:51.063
(bad British accent):
Hello, pardon me, good man,

03:51.139 --> 03:53.565
but can you point me towards
the nearest hot dog?

03:53.642 --> 03:56.068
Who said that?
Where did Gene go?

03:56.144 --> 03:57.402
Hey, come hold this
while I tape.

03:57.479 --> 03:59.571
So, that's your symphony attire?

03:59.648 --> 04:01.564
Yeah, everyone wears a bolo tie
to the symphony.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.149
Crack a book.

04:03.226 --> 04:05.568
-Bob, you look fine, come on.
-BOB: No!

04:05.579 --> 04:07.079
We can't keep looking
for your dress shoes.

04:07.155 --> 04:09.081
-We got to go.
-But these clogs look stupid.

04:09.157 --> 04:11.241
And the whole symphony's
gonna laugh at me.

04:11.252 --> 04:13.493
Maybe the trombone player will
just make a sad trombone sound.

04:13.570 --> 04:15.078
That's what I'm worried about.

04:15.089 --> 04:17.330

04:19.668 --> 04:22.210
I may have outgrown this dress.

04:22.287 --> 04:24.879
Or the dress fits great
and it's just

about the symphony and just
start burning everything

07:40.109 --> 07:42.285
Gene's touched-- his clothes,
his sheets, his room.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.370
The whole house
to be safe, honestly.

07:44.447 --> 07:45.872
No! Not tonight!

07:45.949 --> 07:47.040
We're going out!

07:47.116 --> 07:48.625
We're going to see the symphony!

07:48.635 --> 07:49.801
ALL:
Whoa.

07:49.878 --> 07:51.127
Look, we'll just get
some big mittens

07:51.138 --> 07:53.254
and tape them
to Gene's hands so he can't

07:53.331 --> 07:54.964
scratch and spread it
everywhere, that's all.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.799
It sort of changes
the silhouette

07:56.810 --> 07:59.135
I was going for with my outfit,
but okay.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.813
But, uh, Linda, uh, he'll,
he'll be doing that,

08:01.890 --> 08:03.431
right, at-at the symphony.

08:03.508 --> 08:05.984
He'll just, uh, he'll
look like he's excited.

08:06.061 --> 08:09.103
-Excited for music.
-Okay, look, we-we still have,

08:09.138 --> 08:11.105
like, 20 minutes before we
really have to leave, right?

08:11.182 --> 08:12.482
Barely, yeah.

08:12.493 --> 08:14.317
So I'll run around the corner,

08:14.328 --> 08:17.070
pick up some medicine
real quick, and be back in time

08:17.146 --> 08:19.155
to try and talk you out of this.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.366
Fine, go. I'm gonna go
look for mittens.

08:21.442 --> 08:22.834
Hopefully find some that say
"I don't have worms,

08:22.911 --> 08:24.619
and also my mom is a great mom."

08:24.696 --> 08:27.172
Ugh. I'm gonna go take, like,
eight showers.

08:27.249 --> 08:29.499
Gene, don't touch anything,
and if you have to scratch,

08:29.551 --> 08:31.334
just do it<i> over</i> the clothes,
okay?

08:31.345 --> 08:33.345
Yes, Father. Before you leave,

08:33.421 --> 08:35.255
can you just scatter
some Legos on the rug? (grunts)

08:35.331 --> 08:37.882
No, that wouldn't be fair
to the Legos.

08:37.959 --> 08:41.302
Also, maybe don't leave this
room or general area at all?

08:41.379 --> 08:43.680
-Stay, boy, stay.
-I'm a human being!

08:43.690 --> 08:47.267
Don't leave me alone with him!
I-I mean, hey, fella.

08:47.343 --> 08:49.194
-Tina?
-Yeah?

08:49.271 --> 08:51.029
-Can you do me a favor?
-What?

08:51.106 --> 08:52.364
Will you go
to the kitchen for me?

08:52.440 --> 08:54.148
I need something
to scratch my butt with.

08:54.225 --> 08:56.317
The rug's not pointy enough,

08:56.394 --> 08:58.444
and my cute little chubby
fingers aren't cutting it.

08:58.521 --> 09:00.113
And I'm not supposed to move.

09:00.189 --> 09:02.615
Uh... okay.

09:02.692 --> 09:06.160
Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh.

09:06.237 --> 09:07.537
Aah, worms!

09:07.548 --> 09:09.122
Oh, okay, no, that's spaghetti.

09:09.198 --> 09:10.540
-(grunts)
-Uh, here.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.208
Thank you. (grunts)

09:12.219 --> 09:14.636
-Uh...
-(Gene grunting)

09:16.223 --> 09:18.631
-Tina, just hand it to me!
-Here!

09:18.750 --> 09:19.882
-Ow!
-Sorry.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.302
(grunts) Ah.

09:22.378 --> 09:25.179
-You know, I think I remember
how it happened.
-Oh, yeah? How?

09:25.256 --> 09:27.065
It was a sunny day,
not too long ago.

09:27.142 --> 09:30.018
I was washing my hands
like a good little boy,

09:30.094 --> 09:33.354
and then out of my pocket falls
a tater tot from the cafeteria.

09:33.431 --> 09:35.240
I must've had
a hole in my shorts.

09:35.317 --> 09:38.067
-I have questions, but okay.
-So I go to pick it up

09:38.078 --> 09:39.652
-to eat it.
-To throw it away, yeah.

09:39.729 --> 09:41.487
-Oh, okay.
-And who comes out of the stall

09:41.564 --> 09:44.490
but one Peter Pescadero.

09:44.567 --> 09:47.410
And he leans over, picks up
my tater tot and says...

09:47.421 --> 09:49.412
This your tater tot, Gene?

09:49.423 --> 09:51.581
And before I know it,
I've popped it into my mouth.

09:51.592 --> 09:52.591
And it was delicious!

09:52.667 --> 09:54.167
Oh, Gene, no.

09:54.243 --> 09:56.169
Peter was trying to be nice,
but he was

09:56.245 --> 09:58.004
fresh off the pot
and got worms on my tot!

09:58.081 --> 10:00.098
Wait, Gene, was that the day

10:00.175 --> 10:01.433
you were coming out
of the boys' bathroom

10:01.509 --> 10:03.509
right as I was going
into the girls' bathroom,

10:03.586 --> 10:04.844
and we said "bathroom buddies"
and high-fived?

10:04.921 --> 10:06.220
I think it was.

10:06.297 --> 10:07.889
That was such
a great moment for us.

10:07.965 --> 10:09.223
Tell me you washed your hand

10:09.300 --> 10:11.059
after you touched
that tater tot, Gene!

10:11.135 --> 10:12.393
Why would I ever wash
tater tot off of me?

10:12.470 --> 10:14.354
No! Aah!

10:14.430 --> 10:15.688
Oh, God, I think I feel them!

10:15.765 --> 10:17.273
What, you already feel them?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.941
I don't know how it works, Gene!

10:18.952 --> 10:20.151
Just g-give me that thing!

10:20.228 --> 10:22.236
(grunts) Ah, ah, ah.

10:22.313 --> 10:24.122
That's the stuff.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.616
Pinworm medicine and gum, huh?

10:26.627 --> 10:27.700
Uh, yep.

10:27.777 --> 10:29.369
What's the gum for?

10:29.445 --> 10:31.079
Um... chewing?

10:31.155 --> 10:32.914
Okay, just as long
as you're not gonna

10:32.990 --> 10:35.083
stick it down there
in your situation,

10:35.159 --> 10:36.542
trying to catch those worms,
you know?

10:36.619 --> 10:39.137
What? No. Oh, no. God, no.

10:39.214 --> 10:41.464
Well, full disclosure, sir,
you wouldn't be the first.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.383
I'm... gonna go.

10:43.459 --> 10:44.717
Okay, then.

10:44.794 --> 10:46.311
Okay, I got the medicine.

10:46.388 --> 10:47.979
W-Wait. What-What's...
what's happening?

10:48.056 --> 10:49.389
It's not good, Dad.

10:49.465 --> 10:50.973
-The worms got Tina.
-(Linda grunts)

10:50.984 --> 10:52.934
-Oh, no. They did?
-We don't know that.

10:53.010 --> 10:55.103
It's probably just her brain
thinking she has 'em

10:55.179 --> 10:57.313
and being all spycho-spaztastic.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.823
Psychosomatic?

10:58.900 --> 11:00.316
-What?
-It's real!

11:00.327 --> 11:01.567
They're having a field day
down there, man!

11:01.644 --> 11:03.328
Why is our spaghetti server
thingy in here?

11:03.405 --> 11:06.072
Don't ask questions you don't
want to know the answer to, Dad.

11:06.149 --> 11:07.999
Oh, come on.
I like that thing.

11:08.076 --> 11:09.992
-I'm gonna miss it.
-It has a greater purpose now.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.245
Anyway, it's time to go
to the symphony!

11:12.321 --> 11:14.172
We can do the medicine
in the car.

11:14.249 --> 11:16.165
Here we go, everybody!

11:16.176 --> 11:18.251
-Linda, no.
-It's fine, it's fine.

11:18.327 --> 11:19.919
Shush, shush,
shush, shush, shush, shush.

11:19.996 --> 11:21.504
Hey, Dad, on the bright side,

11:21.556 --> 11:23.172
I saw your dress shoes
in the bathroom.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.350
Really? Wh-Wh-What were
they doing in there?

11:25.427 --> 11:27.427
Maybe they needed to poop, Dad!
I don't know!

11:27.503 --> 11:28.469
Okay.

11:28.546 --> 11:30.471
(grunting)
Damn it!

11:30.548 --> 11:33.015
Mom, can you tape the spaghetti
spoon to my mitten, please?

11:33.026 --> 11:34.851
Don't you think
that would look a little silly?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.861
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
-Aah!

11:36.938 --> 11:38.271
They...
they were behind the tub.

11:38.347 --> 11:39.531
-That's so weird.
-Wait!

11:39.607 --> 11:41.199
Dad, drop those shoes!

11:41.276 --> 11:44.202
Why? W-W-W-Why? Why?
Why are you saying that?

11:44.279 --> 11:46.279
I may have been playing
Bottomless Businessman

11:46.355 --> 11:48.322
after a shower the other day.

11:48.399 --> 11:51.117
You know, no pants, making
deals, mergers, acquisitions.

11:51.194 --> 11:52.535
BOB:
Okay, okay, I got it.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.370
Which I call mergies
and acquizoozies.

11:54.405 --> 11:56.381
Gene, what does this have to do
with my shoes?

11:56.458 --> 11:58.791
I wear your dress shoes when I'm
playing Bottomless Businessman.

11:58.868 --> 12:00.376
That's the "businessman" part.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.545
And also, I might have
scratched some stuff.

12:02.580 --> 12:04.222
Oh, God.
I touched my mustache!

12:04.299 --> 12:07.216
I touched the shoes,
and then I touched my mustache,

12:07.227 --> 12:09.635
'cause I thought there was stuff
in it 'cause there always is,

12:09.712 --> 12:12.972
and I-I-I... I think
I touched my mouth, too. Ugh!

12:13.049 --> 12:14.515
-Ugh!
-Well, that's great.

12:14.592 --> 12:16.350
That's just great.
Now you all have pinworms.

12:16.427 --> 12:18.227
I don't have any pinworms.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.521
Really? You don't think
there's any chance

12:20.598 --> 12:23.024
Gene gave you pinworms?

12:23.100 --> 12:25.193
-♪ ♪
-(both munching)

12:25.269 --> 12:28.154
(both making kissing sounds)

12:28.231 --> 12:30.990
-No, I love you more.
-No, I love you more.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.992
-No, I love<i> you</i> more.
-No, I love<i> you</i> more.

12:33.069 --> 12:34.419
I love you.

12:34.496 --> 12:36.087
Okay,
Gene probably gave me worms.

12:36.164 --> 12:38.539
Louise, where are you going?

12:38.616 --> 12:41.918
-Nowhere.
-Louise, come on.
We got to leave.

12:41.928 --> 12:45.213
Not me. Not in a car, trapped,

12:45.289 --> 12:47.632
with all of you...
and your worms.

12:47.708 --> 12:49.058
Louise, symphony!

12:49.344 --> 12:51.060
(screams)

12:53.607 --> 12:56.057
(panting)
Stay away from me, worm woman!

12:56.133 --> 12:58.434
I'm not gonna give you worms!

12:58.445 --> 12:59.944
I just want to give you...
culture!

13:00.021 --> 13:03.064
-Damn it!
-I am exposing you kids

13:03.140 --> 13:05.358
to classical music
if it's the last thing I do

13:05.434 --> 13:07.360
before these butt worms eat
my whole body!

13:07.436 --> 13:09.445
Bob, Tina, Gene,
block the stairs

13:09.480 --> 13:11.572
in case she gets past me
and tries to go outside.

13:11.649 --> 13:13.908
BOB:
Oh, God, I feel itchy.

13:13.985 --> 13:15.868
Do I already have them?
It feels like I do.

13:15.945 --> 13:17.537
-I don't like this!
-TINA: Grow up, Dad!

13:17.655 --> 13:20.206
Yeah, grow up, Bob,
and block the stairs!

13:20.283 --> 13:21.624
-(Linda straining)
-Okay, fine!

13:21.676 --> 13:23.209
(Bob whimpers)

13:23.286 --> 13:25.628
Here's Mommy! Huh?

13:25.639 --> 13:27.213
(singsongy):
Louise?

13:27.290 --> 13:28.640
Where are you, baby?

13:28.716 --> 13:31.300
My little
Louisey Peasy Over Easy?

13:31.311 --> 13:33.427
Where are you, sweetie?

13:33.504 --> 13:34.979
Gene, you're grounded.

13:35.056 --> 13:38.266
I-I know I shouldn't ground you
for getting sick, but I want to.

13:38.342 --> 13:40.935
Uh-huh. Hey, can you take those
sweet little fingers of yours

13:41.012 --> 13:42.895
and just give me
a quick scratch?

13:42.972 --> 13:45.231
-No!
-Well, then untape us,
you monster!

13:45.308 --> 13:47.441
-Uh, I don't know.
-Come on, Dad.

13:47.518 --> 13:49.610
We have the right to scratch our
butts like every other citizen.

13:49.687 --> 13:52.154
But your mom's really scary
right now, and if I untape you,

13:52.165 --> 13:54.156
I-I don't know
what she'll do to me.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.117
-(Gene grunts)
-I hope your worms are hungry.

13:56.193 --> 13:57.952
-Tina!
-Oh, too much? Sorry.

13:58.029 --> 13:59.954
(singsongy):
Louise?

14:00.031 --> 14:02.707
It's okay.
You don't need to be scared.

14:02.783 --> 14:04.417
You under here?
Where are ya?

14:04.493 --> 14:06.168

-Oh, my face!

14:06.179 --> 14:08.421
Oh, stupid blanket! Louise?!

14:08.497 --> 14:10.965
W-Where'd Louise go?

14:11.042 --> 14:12.842
-Oh, I-I... I don't know.
-You didn't see her?!

14:12.853 --> 14:14.677
We've got a lot going on, Mom.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.521
-Oh, calm down, Tina.
<i> -You</i> calm down.

14:16.598 --> 14:18.681
Louise always talked about
wanting to see Machu Picchu.

I couldn't get

because of my tiny arms, so I
made a rope out of paper towel.

15:36.344 --> 15:37.677
Okay.

15:37.753 --> 15:39.345
You were supposed to think
I used it to climb down,

15:39.422 --> 15:42.181
and then you'd totally freak out
and probably faint,

15:42.258 --> 15:45.017
like, "Wha-uh," and I'd have
time to jump in the window

15:45.136 --> 15:46.268
and run out the front door.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.112
But it's so short,
and it's paper towel.

15:48.189 --> 15:50.356
-It was a good plan!
-Come on.

15:50.433 --> 15:52.066
We still have time to see
the second half of the show

15:52.143 --> 15:54.944
-if we hurry.
-(sighs) Fine. Fine!

15:54.955 --> 15:57.363
Just give me some space,
Wonder<i> Wormon.</i>

15:57.440 --> 15:58.906
Okay, okay.

15:58.983 --> 16:01.242
That's a girl.

16:01.318 --> 16:03.119
Now we're all gonna go to the
symphony and have a good time

16:03.129 --> 16:05.037
and soak it up into our brains.
Right?

16:05.114 --> 16:06.464
You know, you're right.
It'll be fun.

16:06.541 --> 16:08.374
And maybe pinworms
aren't so bad.

16:08.451 --> 16:10.251
I mean, they're probably
more scared of our butts

16:10.327 --> 16:12.128
than our butts are scared
of them, right?

16:12.138 --> 16:14.630
(laughs)
Oh, my God, raccoons.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.090
Are they having a...
dance-off?

16:16.167 --> 16:17.216
What? Where?

16:17.293 --> 16:19.427
-(grunting)
-Damn it, Louise!

16:19.503 --> 16:21.229
(both screaming)

16:22.339 --> 16:23.222
Crap, crap, crap.

16:23.299 --> 16:24.983
Hello, there.
(grunts)

16:25.059 --> 16:26.267
You're trapped, Louise.
There's nowhere to run.

16:26.343 --> 16:28.894
(grunting)

16:28.971 --> 16:31.063
-No. No!
-Just give in, Louise.

16:31.140 --> 16:32.773
You don't want to be
the one weirdo in the family

16:32.850 --> 16:34.442
who doesn't have worms, do you?

16:34.518 --> 16:36.569
It helps to pretend they're not
worms, they're butterflies.

16:36.645 --> 16:38.320
It-it... I don't know,
it's just my process.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.497
Butt-er-flies.

16:39.574 --> 16:40.573
Oh, yeah, I didn't even
think of that.

16:40.649 --> 16:42.450
Uh, Linda, I have to say,

16:42.526 --> 16:44.910
-you look
really athletic right now.
-Thanks.

16:44.987 --> 16:45.995
There's some pee coming out.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.338
Okay, a lot of pee. Oh, God.

16:47.415 --> 16:50.174
Uh-huh. Also, maybe, uh,
we should think about

16:50.251 --> 16:51.917
-everybody taking the medicine.
-Not now, Bob!

16:51.994 --> 16:52.752
Right, sorry.

16:52.828 --> 16:55.504
Oh... so dizzy. Ah.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.673
Not me. I could run in tiny
circles like this forever

16:57.684 --> 16:59.300
and don't need to throw up
at all.

16:59.376 --> 17:01.135
Whoa!

17:01.212 --> 17:03.137
KIDS:
No!

17:03.214 --> 17:04.430
Is the hamster okay?!
Is the hamster okay?!

17:04.507 --> 17:07.025
Oh, right.
We don't have a hamster.

17:09.512 --> 17:12.188
You killed it! You killed
our beautiful hamster slide,

17:12.198 --> 17:14.198
the only thing I've ever loved.

17:14.275 --> 17:16.150
You were so jealous of it,
you had to destroy it.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.610
Isn't that right, Mother?!

17:17.686 --> 17:19.695
Kids, shush.
Linda, are you okay?

17:19.706 --> 17:21.363
Linda? Lin?

17:21.374 --> 17:24.208
Oh, my God,
the slide's dead<i> and</i> Mom's dead?

17:24.285 --> 17:25.659
And I've got butt worms?
What the hell?!

17:25.736 --> 17:28.046
I'm not dead. I'm just sad.

17:28.122 --> 17:29.547
(sighs):
Linda, it's okay.

17:29.624 --> 17:33.167
It's-- sorry, kids-- just
a bunch of toilet paper rolls.

17:33.244 --> 17:34.877
-(kids gasp)
-Dad, come here.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.003
Mm-mm.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.129
Okay, I'm gonna slap your leg.

17:37.206 --> 17:38.631
-Ow.
-Yeah.

17:38.707 --> 17:41.133
Lin, are you... are you gonna
get off the floor?

17:41.210 --> 17:42.843
-No.
-Okay.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.221
I'm a bad mom. And I'm tired.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.889
And I think I pulled
my boob muscle.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.015
And my butt itches.

17:48.092 --> 17:49.558
You're not a bad mom, Lin.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.235
-Yes, I am.
-No, you're not.

17:51.312 --> 17:53.896
Kids, tell your mom
that she's a good mom.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.907
Yeah, maybe ask me later
when my life's work isn't

17:55.983 --> 17:58.025
laying shattered before my eyes.

17:58.102 --> 18:00.069
I love you, Mom,
but I'm still pressing charges.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.403
You're going away
for a long time!

18:01.414 --> 18:03.072
I'm gonna miss you so damn much!

18:03.083 --> 18:04.365
Maybe Mom didn't do this.

18:04.441 --> 18:06.325
Maybe the worms were
controlling her.

18:06.402 --> 18:07.868
God, what are my worms gonna
make me do?

18:07.945 --> 18:09.578
-Get rid of your bangs?
-Oh, no.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.372
Okay, we're-we're getting
off topic here.

18:11.448 --> 18:13.082
Why don't we just all take
the medicine

18:13.093 --> 18:15.417
and then go to the symphony?

18:15.428 --> 18:18.045
Even though I still think
that's a really terrible idea.

18:18.122 --> 18:19.880
Not-not the medicine.

18:19.957 --> 18:21.841
The medicine we should've done,
like, right away.

18:21.917 --> 18:23.509
Not-not that you're a bad mom

18:23.586 --> 18:27.105
for chasing Louise like
a crazy person around the house

18:27.181 --> 18:29.974
instead of... taking
the medi-medicine.

18:30.050 --> 18:31.275
If-- It doesn't matter.

18:31.352 --> 18:33.602
LINDA:
We're not gonna make it
to the symphony.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.020
I failed you kids.

18:35.097 --> 18:37.273
If you grow up dumb,
it's my fault.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.358
I mean, it's not like Dad
brought a ton to the table.

18:39.435 --> 18:40.359
A distinct odor?

18:40.436 --> 18:42.570
Okay, thank you.

18:42.646 --> 18:45.456
Lin, our kids are mean.
To me right now.

18:45.533 --> 18:47.458
But they turned out pretty good.

18:47.535 --> 18:49.535
We're not saying they didn't
turn out pretty good, right?

18:49.612 --> 18:51.954
LINDA:
They're still young.
It could go either way.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.415
Well, I just don't think
you should feel so bad.

18:54.491 --> 18:56.542
Look at this weird,
elaborate thing they made

18:56.619 --> 18:57.626
out of toilet paper rolls.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.919
It's a hamster slide.

18:58.996 --> 19:00.045
We've said it, like,
a thousand times.

19:00.122 --> 19:02.756
Shush. Normal, dumb,
unstimulated kids

19:02.833 --> 19:05.259
wouldn't build something
like this, would they?

19:05.336 --> 19:06.844
We've got the brains
and the looks.

19:06.921 --> 19:08.429
-And the body.
-And the worms.

19:08.505 --> 19:11.640
Not to mention, we're wonderful.
Just in general.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.435
LINDA:
You are wonderful.
The best three kids I know.

19:14.511 --> 19:15.987
Better than Hanson? Wow.

19:16.063 --> 19:18.147
Yeah. And we made them this way,

19:18.158 --> 19:21.325
parenting them really,
eh,<i> pretty</i> well.

19:21.402 --> 19:23.235
And, yes,
two out of three of 'em

19:23.312 --> 19:24.612
probably have pinworms
right now,

19:24.688 --> 19:26.488
but so do we, probably.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.240
I mean, I know I do.

19:28.317 --> 19:31.243
'Cause look at the way
I'm clenching my butt.

19:31.320 --> 19:32.003
Yeah, I guess it was
a pretty cool

19:32.079 --> 19:33.454
toilet paper thingy, huh?

19:33.530 --> 19:35.247
-Hamster slide.
-That you crushed.

19:35.324 --> 19:37.175
Sorry. Ah, maybe
something we're doing

19:37.210 --> 19:39.251
is working, I guess. Right?

19:39.328 --> 19:41.921
You know, it's almost like
the report cards

19:41.997 --> 19:44.348
are the idiots, huh?
(laughs) Yeah?

19:44.425 --> 19:45.883
Yeah. You're right.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.518
Just 'cause we don't do
our homework

19:47.595 --> 19:50.179
or study for tests or pay
attention, that's our fault?

19:50.190 --> 19:52.523
Exactly what I used to say
about me.

19:52.600 --> 19:55.526
Okay, now I'm starting to worry
we are bad parents.

19:55.603 --> 19:57.269
Shh, shh, shh, Dad,
we're helping Mom.

19:57.346 --> 20:00.072
Aw, come here, guys. Family hug.

20:00.107 --> 20:01.257
Ew, no. You all have worms.

20:01.259 --> 20:02.691
-Don't touch me.
-Right, right, right.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.036
Okay, okay.
Wormy Belchers, get in here.

20:05.112 --> 20:07.321
(all moaning)

20:07.398 --> 20:08.873
LINDA:
Gotcha. I love yous.

20:08.950 --> 20:11.000
Oh, God, that's so nasty.

20:12.194 --> 20:14.828
Okay, down the hatch, everybody.

20:14.905 --> 20:17.206
(coughs): Oh, yeah,
if you punks gave me worms,

20:17.217 --> 20:19.383
those worms are definitely not
gonna like this.

20:19.460 --> 20:21.961
Wait, this doesn't<i> kill</i> kill
them, does it?

20:22.037 --> 20:23.221
It's just a strong warning
for them

20:23.297 --> 20:25.547
-to clean up their act, right?
-No, yeah, yeah.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.342
Hey, guys, guess what we have
in the basement.

20:28.419 --> 20:30.895
-A dark secret?
-No. Better.

20:30.972 --> 20:32.563
A bunch of cardboard.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.182
Maybe we can bring that up
and rebuild the hamster slide,

20:35.259 --> 20:36.976
bigger than ever?

20:37.052 --> 20:38.894
Ooh, and we could make
a hamster office park

20:38.905 --> 20:41.230
next door to the slide,
and maybe the hamster's boss is

20:41.241 --> 20:42.982
a fun-loving
bottomless businessman

20:43.058 --> 20:44.358
who works hard and plays harder.

20:44.435 --> 20:45.484
We're gonna need more hamsters.

20:45.561 --> 20:47.403
We're not getting hamsters.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.321
Uh, I'm gonna buy a marble,
and you guys are gonna be

20:49.398 --> 20:52.416
-really surprised
at how fun it is.
-Ah.

20:52.493 --> 20:54.326
Marble would be a great name
for one of the hamsters.

20:54.403 --> 20:57.037
-Or Tiffany.
-I'm going to the symphony.

20:57.114 --> 20:58.080
-Bye.
-OTHERS: Bye.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.573
Bring back a hamster.
