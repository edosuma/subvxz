Coming up tonight: Quahog's own
poet laureate comes to the set

00:39.039 --> 00:41.916
and graces us with her...
Oh, God, that's tonight?

00:42.000 --> 00:43.460
Hey, Jerome, turn on the game.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.253
Sorry, guys, cable's out.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.922
We're only getting local stations.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.467
Oh, what, so now we got
to talk sports to pass the time?

00:50.550 --> 00:53.219
Or maybe watch Gilmore Girls.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.638
Just as, like, a goof.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.432
You know, if you want to talk sports,

00:57.515 --> 00:59.351
I've got quite a story to tell.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.978
Oh! Oh! This is the one
where Lorelai's mom makes

01:02.062 --> 01:04.022
her martini with an onion
instead of an olive.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.274
Boy, that's a passive-aggressive move.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.193
If you knew her mom, you'd know that's

01:08.276 --> 01:09.819
a passive-aggressive move.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.946
It all started when I was a young boy...

01:12.030 --> 01:14.407
Last chance on this Gilmore Girls thing.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.534
I was a baseball prodigy.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.703
It was back home in the Cuban league.

01:18.787 --> 01:22.665
I grew up working in the tobacco
fields outside of Havana.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.627
That's where I learned to play baseball.

01:25.710 --> 01:29.130
Our mitts were made of cigars,
some of them still going.

01:29.214 --> 01:32.133
All right! Ha! All right, I caught it!

01:32.217 --> 01:35.261
At night I drove a cab.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.223
We all had to drive huge cars there.

01:38.306 --> 01:40.892
I was just a regular young man
wearing pants

01:40.975 --> 01:42.477
that went above my belly button.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.562
Pull your pants up.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.609
When I was nine, my father took me

01:49.693 --> 01:52.028
to my first baseball game.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.573
Fidel Castro was there
to throw out the first pitch.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.159
He was wearing the same outfit as always.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.912
Later we would find out
he had a fashion disease

02:00.995 --> 02:03.665
known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

02:03.748 --> 02:05.792
We would write more jokes about him,

02:05.875 --> 02:08.586
but our dumb-dumb writers
only know what he looks like.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.630
Strike!

02:10.714 --> 02:12.590
(cheering and applause)

02:14.259 --> 02:16.511
We all worshipped Che Guevara.

02:16.594 --> 02:19.139
Although none of us really knew
what side he was on.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.598
Thank you?

02:20.682 --> 02:22.934
But we knew he'd make a great poster

02:23.018 --> 02:25.562
in college dorm rooms someday.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.815
ANNOUNCER:
Please rise for the Cuban National Anthem.

02:28.898 --> 02:32.694
( I Love Lucy theme song playing)

02:32.777 --> 02:36.072
CLEVELAND:
In Cuba, we hated America so much,

02:36.156 --> 02:38.199
we copied everything they did.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.702
And died trying to get there.

02:40.785 --> 02:42.746
(crowd cheering, clamoring)

02:46.666 --> 02:47.834
(music ends)

02:47.917 --> 02:49.961
Castro said there were CIA

02:50.045 --> 02:53.048
all over our island, but I never saw any.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.091
(cheering, clamoring)

03:00.388 --> 03:02.974
Yeah! Ha-ha! All right!

03:03.058 --> 03:06.895
But from that day on,
I fell in love with baseball.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.773
I dreamed of one day
playing in the big leagues,

03:09.856 --> 03:12.525
so I signed up for a montage
to get better.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.943
(glass breaks)

03:14.027 --> 03:16.196
(Cuban music playing)

03:24.371 --> 03:27.499
I was at the top of my game.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.210
I didn't even need the full montage.

03:32.128 --> 03:35.548
I was even recruited to play
on Cuba's national team,

03:35.632 --> 03:37.133
the Gooding Juniors.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.469
ANNOUNCER:
Tonight, the Cuba Gooding Juniors

03:39.552 --> 03:42.180
take on the Haiti Joel Osments!

03:42.263 --> 03:44.641
We tried to play, but it was difficult

03:44.724 --> 03:47.644
because hurricane season
was February through January.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.979
(all shouting)

03:51.147 --> 03:53.900
Every time, a hurricane
would sweep through,

03:53.983 --> 03:55.902
decimating the island, causing hundreds

03:55.985 --> 03:56.986
of dollars worth of damage.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.279
Aah!

03:58.363 --> 04:01.616
Under Castro, every male
over the age of 18

04:01.700 --> 04:04.744
was required to serve
two years as a band leader.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.555
It was nothing against Cuba.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.931
Cuba was nice.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.433
We had a Bay of Hotties,

05:08.516 --> 05:11.144
but also another bay
of less attractive women.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.188
I forget what they called it.

05:13.271 --> 05:16.483
However, tensions between
the U.S. and Cuba were high.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.194
Castro was not happy that they had named

05:19.277 --> 05:22.947
the most dangerously gay part
of San Francisco after him.

05:23.031 --> 05:26.368
Defecting to the U.S. was
punishable by prison or death.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.787
But I was determined.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.246
Then came my chance.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.998
The Cuba Gooding Juniors had

05:32.082 --> 05:33.875
an away game in Barbados.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.878
Oy, hermano, we can escape
to the Cayman Islands.

05:36.961 --> 05:41.007
Cayman, my ass.
I'm going to America.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.971
Okay, when we land in America,

05:47.055 --> 05:50.266
we all have to stop saying "Cooba."

05:50.350 --> 05:54.020
The sea was choppy,
and the sharks were relentless.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.730
-(snores)
-(knock on door)

05:55.814 --> 05:58.400
-Who is it?
-MALE: Uh, not a shark?

05:58.483 --> 06:00.777
-Don't open it!
-MALE: No, it's just people.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.320
-MALE 2: Yeah, people.
-MALE 3: And sharks.

06:02.404 --> 06:05.156
MALE:
Shh! No sharks. Just people.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.745
CLEVELAND:
After a week at sea,

06:10.829 --> 06:13.665
we saw the glittering lights of Miami.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.753
(cheering)

06:18.837 --> 06:20.755
It was beautiful.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.924
Then we decided to go to Quahog instead,

06:23.008 --> 06:24.676
which took eight more months.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.928
Eventually, I signed a large deal

06:27.012 --> 06:29.097
with the Toronto Blue Jays.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.057
But because I was
from a warm-weather climate,

06:31.141 --> 06:33.143
it didn't work out.

06:34.686 --> 06:37.063
-I still remembermy first major-league game.
-(cheering)

06:37.147 --> 06:40.275
It was four hours and 25 minutes long.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.902
I was like, "What the (bleep)?"

06:47.991 --> 06:50.910
Wow, Cleveland.
I had no idea you played baseball.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.328
Too bad you couldn't hit a home run

06:52.412 --> 06:53.496
with The Cleveland Show.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.331
Well, it certainly wasn't a whiff.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.416
More of a foul out.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.543
It was a double.

06:58.626 --> 06:59.919
You know, you're not the only one

07:00.003 --> 07:01.588
who got a taste of sports glory.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.131
I had a pretty good run, myself.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.799
Scrawny little guy like you, Quagmire?

07:04.883 --> 07:06.134
What did you play?

07:06.217 --> 07:07.677
I was a competitive tennis player.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.804
Some might say too competitive.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.806
But I was the breath of fresh air

07:11.890 --> 07:14.309
that the stuffy tennis world needed.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.644
I was born into a real tennis family.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.522
On my first birthday,
my mother gave me a little Head.

07:21.066 --> 07:24.152
I wanted to be the first
male cheerleader for tennis.

07:24.235 --> 07:27.238
I cheer on two occasions:
day and night!

07:27.322 --> 07:30.158
-Ooh, tennis!
-(crowd booing)

07:31.993 --> 07:35.330
And when that was weird,
I decided to just play tennis.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.418
But it was understood
I'd grow up to be a tennis player

07:40.502 --> 07:42.796
like my father and his father before him

07:42.879 --> 07:44.172
and his father before him.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.841
We came from a long line of tennis dicks.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.093
I had six brothers,

07:48.176 --> 07:49.678
but they'd all sliced off their hands

07:49.761 --> 07:51.262
opening a tennis ball can,

07:51.346 --> 07:54.432
possibly the most dangerous
object known to mankind.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.935
Hey, guys.
Anyone want to play tennis?

07:57.018 --> 07:58.353
Llewellyn, no!

07:59.479 --> 08:01.481
(screaming)

08:04.984 --> 08:06.653
QUAGMIRE:
But I would do everything I could

08:06.736 --> 08:08.655
to make my now-female father happy.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.240
Practices were intense.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.533
PETER:
I feel like you skipped over

08:11.616 --> 08:13.493
a very big story point right there.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.412
QUAGMIRE:
My father was a World War II vet,

08:15.495 --> 08:17.831
so he used to make me reenact
the D-Day landing

08:17.914 --> 08:19.165
with tennis ball machines.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.667
(gasps)

08:23.211 --> 08:24.713
(grunting)

08:24.796 --> 08:26.381
But the work paid off.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.717
I got invited to the first U.S. Open,

08:28.800 --> 08:31.594
which, at the time,
was called the U.S. Now Open.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.431
There, I met the player
who would become my archrival:

08:34.514 --> 08:37.017
Sweden's Hedd Banssen.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.478
He'd bring his personal chef
to every match,

08:40.562 --> 08:41.646
which was very distracting.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.231
Aah!
What the hell?

08:43.314 --> 08:45.650
Hergy bergy meatball throwy!

08:45.734 --> 08:47.360
(grunts)

08:47.444 --> 08:50.113
Come on, this can't be legal.
What are you, blind?

08:50.196 --> 08:52.240
Serve ball!

08:55.160 --> 08:56.995
QUAGMIRE:
I was the bad boy of tennis,

08:57.078 --> 09:00.248
and my unconventional style
of play changed the game.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.834
Before I came along, tennis was so safe,

09:02.917 --> 09:05.003
it was customary
to hit a six-handed backhand.

09:05.086 --> 09:08.298
I pioneered the one-handed backhand

09:08.381 --> 09:11.217
and, eventually, the no-handed backhand.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.635
(cheering)

09:12.719 --> 09:15.430
Quagmire, I love your backhand.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.515
That sounds like a backhanded compliment.

09:17.599 --> 09:18.850
(audience gasps)

09:18.933 --> 09:21.686
I also flouted tennis etiquette

09:21.770 --> 09:23.563
by wearing the longest, baggiest shorts

09:23.646 --> 09:26.107
the game had ever seen.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.859
People criticized my style of play

09:27.942 --> 09:30.195
because I argued with umpires

09:30.278 --> 09:32.072
and was taught to bounce the ball 40 times

09:32.155 --> 09:33.990
before my serve.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.721

Let, first service.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.655
I'd won the U.S. Open,

10:13.738 --> 10:15.365
but I wouldn't settle for just that.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.910
My goal was the coveted Grand Slam:

10:18.993 --> 10:22.122
pancakes, eggs,
sausage and bacon at Denny's.
