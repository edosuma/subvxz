WEBVTT

00:02.040 --> 00:04.599
Colonel, I think I ought to tell
you that my own views on

00:04.599 --> 00:06.440
such subjects are very strong.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.960
I am, in fact, a convinced
disbeliever

00:10.960 --> 00:14.480
in what is called the
"supernatural".

00:14.480 --> 00:19.160
"What?!" said the Colonel, "Do you
mean to tell me you don't believe in

00:19.160 --> 00:26.079
"second-sight, or ghosts,
or anything of that kind?"

00:26.079 --> 00:29.160
I blew a whistle twice,

00:29.160 --> 00:35.479
and the wind seemed to come
absolutely in answer to my call.

00:35.479 --> 00:37.719
There was a rustling and shaking,

00:37.719 --> 00:40.960
surely more than any rat
could cause.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.880
But the reader will hardly,

00:42.880 --> 00:47.200
perhaps, imagine how dreadful it was
to him to see a figure

00:47.200 --> 00:52.439
suddenly sit up in what
he had known to be an empty bed.

00:54.119 --> 00:57.280
Argh! All right, all right.
That's enough.

00:57.280 --> 01:00.479
Come on, come on out,
that's it, come on out.

01:00.479 --> 01:03.359
It's getting late. You've got school
tomorrow. All right, Mummy.

01:03.359 --> 01:05.078
Put your coats on.

01:05.078 --> 01:10.359
Next time, maybe you can tell them
something a bit less ghastly.

01:10.359 --> 01:12.359
Well, it's a classic.

01:12.359 --> 01:15.159
A whistle that summons
supernatural forces?

01:15.159 --> 01:17.319
Ah, yes, the whistle is a metaphor,
you see.

01:17.319 --> 01:21.120
Well, your "metaphor" is going to
keep the children up half the night.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.159
All right. Next time it'll be
Goldilocks And The Three Bears,

01:24.159 --> 01:25.599
I promise. Um...

01:29.760 --> 01:31.439
Dad, it's all right.

01:31.439 --> 01:34.719
You don't have to keep... The
children need clothes, don't they?

01:38.400 --> 01:40.159
You sure you can afford it?

01:40.159 --> 01:41.840
Don't you worry about me.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.799
You're all that matters.

01:43.799 --> 01:45.960
You and those children.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.799
Now, Henry and Margaret,
you are to be good to your mother.

01:51.799 --> 01:53.079
And remember...

01:53.079 --> 01:56.200
..ghosts only
exist in books.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.240
In real life,
there is no such thing.

02:00.519 --> 02:02.040
Come on.

04:01.039 --> 04:03.919
Professor.
Father.

04:03.919 --> 04:07.080
Fascinating. So you've finally seen
the light?

04:07.080 --> 04:10.680
I don't think I'm ready to give up
the cassock just yet... Damn.

04:10.680 --> 04:14.840
..but I look forward to arguing with
you at length over Russell's

04:14.840 --> 04:17.000
more questionable assertions
on religion.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.360
I've been saving a bottle of brandy
for just such an occasion.

04:20.360 --> 04:24.600
Tonight? I can't tonight, erm...but
we'll make an arrangement soon.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.720
CAR HORN BEEPS

04:26.720 --> 04:28.759
Try not to fall asleep at the wheel.

04:28.759 --> 04:30.680
We're parked.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.600
Looks like you've got to be going.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.800
Evening picnic.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.920
I don't fancy your chances.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.360
Mrs McCarthy has set her heart
on it.

04:40.240 --> 04:42.759
And besides, I have my trusty
umbrella.

04:42.759 --> 04:45.040
I suspect you're going to be
needing it.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.840
Well, I must dash now,
got some papers to mark.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.240
So I'll see you soon.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.279
No.

04:57.639 --> 04:59.560
No, definitely not there.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.439
I'm sure I packed them.

05:01.439 --> 05:03.319
Strange.

05:03.319 --> 05:05.399
There's nothing strange about it.

05:05.399 --> 05:07.879
How much sleep did you get
last night?

05:07.879 --> 05:10.800
Or more to the point,
how much alcohol did you consume?

05:10.800 --> 05:12.600
I was at a friend's birthday party!

05:12.600 --> 05:14.199
It doesn't make sense.

05:14.199 --> 05:16.439
It makes perfect sense to me.

05:16.439 --> 05:19.920
It explains why she forgot to pack
my strawberry scones.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.279
You'll have a perfectly fine picnic
without strawberry scones.

05:23.279 --> 05:24.759
Don't be so ridiculous.

05:24.759 --> 05:27.199
Robert prides himself on
his rationalism.

05:27.199 --> 05:28.959
What? Who? There's something wrong.

05:28.959 --> 05:30.639
What are you talking about?

05:30.639 --> 05:33.199
I need to go back to the
Professor's. I can give you a lift.

05:33.199 --> 05:34.240
No, thanks.

Robert, so sorry to disturb
your marking.

06:16.519 --> 06:18.040
Car broken down.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.639
May I use your telephone?

06:19.639 --> 06:21.519
Yes, it's a gift from my brother.

06:21.519 --> 06:23.519
He has an ironic sense of humour.

06:23.519 --> 06:25.480
You know where the blower is.

06:32.480 --> 06:33.560
More irony?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.680
Are you going to make
your telephone call?

06:36.840 --> 06:39.319
The car didn't break down, did it?

06:40.639 --> 06:42.680
Robert, what's going on?

06:42.680 --> 06:44.759
I'm having a party.

06:44.759 --> 06:46.959
A party? With an occult theme.

06:46.959 --> 06:48.480
Just a bit of fun.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.040
And you didn't invite me?

06:50.040 --> 06:52.040
I didn't think it was appropriate.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.159
What's in the box?

06:53.159 --> 06:56.079
I'm sorry, Father, but my guests
will be arriving any moment.

06:56.079 --> 06:57.439
I don't want to be rude, but...

06:59.720 --> 07:01.000
Don't worry.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.480
I'll be on my best behaviour.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.120
Wait here.

07:13.120 --> 07:15.720
Major Winthrop. Thank you so much
for...

07:15.720 --> 07:20.720
I'm warning you - if this is a con,
I'll have your guts for breakfast.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.160
I won't be fooled, Wiseman.
I won't be fooled.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.959
Understood. But I can assure you...

07:25.959 --> 07:27.560
Where is it?

07:27.560 --> 07:28.839
Through here.

07:37.759 --> 07:40.240
Of course.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.360
Something of that power.

07:42.360 --> 07:46.600
I'll bet the Church would pay
anything to get their hands on it.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.040
I'm rich, but I'm not that rich.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.279
I'm sorry?

07:50.279 --> 07:53.680
You didn't tell me there was
interest from the Vatican.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.120
Father Brown's a friend,
and he was just leav...

07:56.120 --> 07:57.680
KNOCKS AT DOOR

08:00.680 --> 08:01.959
Please, go.

08:01.959 --> 08:04.160
I will explain everything later.

08:04.160 --> 08:07.360
Go? And miss the party?

The cloves.

08:21.879 --> 08:24.199
Quickly, quickly.

08:32.799 --> 08:35.440
This house needs to be cleansed.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.360
The energy here is unsettled.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.080
Duly noted.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.960
Understood.

08:41.960 --> 08:44.519
Archie. My son.

08:44.519 --> 08:46.039
Just ignore him.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.840
Dorothy Parnell.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.000
Major Basil Winthrop.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.559
Is the military bidding?

09:04.559 --> 09:05.960
Is that a problem?

09:05.960 --> 09:09.519
It's not a weapon. You can't bend
its power to your will.

09:09.519 --> 09:11.200
And you can?

09:11.200 --> 09:13.000
No-one can.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
We must simply submit to it.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.600
Let it guide us.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.039
What are we talking about?

09:18.039 --> 09:19.759
The whistle, of course.

09:19.759 --> 09:20.799
Whistle?

09:20.799 --> 09:22.519
KNOCKS AT DOOR

09:22.519 --> 09:24.200
You can't control it.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.960
You're a fool if you think you can.

09:26.960 --> 09:30.559
With all due respect, Dotty -
may I call you, Dotty? -

09:30.559 --> 09:32.279
why should I listen to you?

09:32.279 --> 09:34.960
My mother is a renowned
psychic medium.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.799
Our final guest.

09:39.799 --> 09:42.039
Lilith Crowe. A pleasure.

09:42.039 --> 09:43.759
Major Basil Winthrop. Dorothy...

09:43.759 --> 09:45.480
Dorothy Parnell.

09:45.480 --> 09:46.919
Have we met?

09:46.919 --> 09:50.720
I attended one of your public
readings many years ago.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.080
Did I read for you?

09:52.080 --> 09:56.000
For my mother. You helped her
through a very difficult time.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.080
Thank you.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.679
Oh, my dear.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.279
What's your interest in this?

10:04.279 --> 10:06.600
I'm a collector.
Of whistles?

10:06.600 --> 10:07.960
Of objets d'art.

10:07.960 --> 10:12.519
This isn't a pretty little ornament
for your dressing table, you know.

10:12.519 --> 10:14.720
Where is it? It's in the next room.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.879
I can feel it. Yes.

10:16.879 --> 10:18.399
It's in the dining room.

10:18.399 --> 10:21.320
That's all well and dandy,
but I shall require a little more

10:21.320 --> 10:24.279
evidence than the FEELINGS
of an old woman.

10:24.279 --> 10:26.600
Oh! What's that, my dear?

10:26.600 --> 10:29.200
SHE CHUCKLES
Oh-h-h-h-h!

10:29.200 --> 10:31.639
Oh, yes, he is, isn't he?

10:31.639 --> 10:34.080
It's Philip. My late husband.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.159
He says you're a pompous ass.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.240
And he says, "Tuck your shirt in."

10:41.240 --> 10:42.879
Sorry, Father.

10:42.879 --> 10:44.639
And that's from him.

10:45.679 --> 10:48.360
I promise you, before this night is
over,

10:48.360 --> 10:51.600
you will all be convinced of the
whistle's power

10:51.600 --> 10:53.440
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.399
What power?

10:55.399 --> 10:57.679
THUNDER RUMBLES

11:03.720 --> 11:07.000
Nothing like a refreshing downpour
to liven up a picnic.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.399
Everything is absolutely sodden.

11:10.399 --> 11:12.679
Well...

11:12.679 --> 11:17.120
..you'll have to save what you can
and throw the rest away.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.279
Father?

11:19.399 --> 11:20.799
Father?

11:23.919 --> 11:26.039
I hope he's still not out in that
deluge.

11:26.039 --> 11:27.720
Well, we would've passed him.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.080
He must still be at the Professor's.
I'll go pick him up.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.960
You will do no such thing!

11:31.960 --> 11:34.320
I'm not scared of a bit of
thunder and lightning.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.960
THUNDER

11:35.960 --> 11:38.000
Maybe I will wait until it's over.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.279
Oh, Whistle And I'll Come to you,
My Lad.

11:53.279 --> 11:56.759
Published in 1904 by MR James.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.159
The story of a whistle...

11:58.159 --> 12:01.440
Yes, yes, yes, we've read the story.
Get on with it.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.799
I have reason to believe that James
was inspired

12:03.799 --> 12:06.480
not just by his imagination...

12:06.480 --> 12:08.519
..but by historical fact.

12:08.519 --> 12:12.240
A genuine whistle with genuine
supernatural properties.

12:12.240 --> 12:13.720
So you said in your letter.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.399
You also promised us proof.

12:16.679 --> 12:20.000
The Fourth Book Of
Occult Philosophy, 1655.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
A recently discovered footnote makes
reference to a whistle

12:23.000 --> 12:28.159
possessing mystical qualities dating
back to the mid-15th century.

12:28.159 --> 12:33.519
And this extract from the journal of
Benedict Augustus,

12:33.519 --> 12:36.519
a Franciscan friar, tells the same
story,

12:36.519 --> 12:39.039
elaborating on its construction.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.919
He writes that the whistle was
carved from the skull of

12:42.919 --> 12:46.159
Catherine Woodford,
a heretic burned at the stake.

12:47.840 --> 12:51.840
It was created by her father,
a master of the occult.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.039
How did you acquire the object?

12:57.039 --> 12:58.679
I found it. Found it?

12:58.679 --> 13:02.000
At the excavation of a Medieval
burial site.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.960
How can we be sure it's real?

13:03.960 --> 13:06.480
Because I've used it.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.840
I have seen its power.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.440
And you will too.

13:20.799 --> 13:22.399
Wait.

13:22.399 --> 13:24.799
Mother, we should leave.

13:24.799 --> 13:26.559
Don't be a coward.

13:26.559 --> 13:29.000
Just blow the damn thing!

13:32.120 --> 13:34.480
HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLING

13:48.919 --> 13:52.240
Was that it? No. That
was just a draught.

13:53.519 --> 13:56.159
The spirits won't reveal themselves
at once,

13:56.159 --> 13:58.039
they'll come in their own time.

13:58.039 --> 14:00.360
How long are we supposed to wait?

14:00.360 --> 14:02.360
It could take hours.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.080
I've prepared rooms.

14:05.519 --> 14:07.240
Philip?

14:07.240 --> 14:08.440
What's wrong?

14:08.440 --> 14:09.799
He's gone.

14:11.399 --> 14:13.600
THUNDER RUMBLES

14:24.559 --> 14:26.679
Why are you doing this?

14:26.679 --> 14:28.559
I'm a believer.

14:28.559 --> 14:31.120
I've seen it with my own eyes.

14:31.120 --> 14:35.279
But you have always said
we should not trust our own eyes.

14:35.279 --> 14:36.559
I was wrong.

14:39.799 --> 14:41.559
I don't believe you.

14:41.559 --> 14:43.840
Then, perhaps you better leave.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.759
THUNDER CRACKS

14:50.200 --> 14:51.919
I'm not going anywhere.

14:55.240 --> 14:58.080
I've placed mirrors
throughout the house.

14:58.080 --> 15:01.399
The spirits often like
to manifest in them.

15:01.399 --> 15:03.559
And what of the evil spirits?

15:03.559 --> 15:06.320
The incense should keep them at bay.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.159
Amateur.

15:08.159 --> 15:11.440
How did the spirits manifest
themselves when you first

15:11.440 --> 15:12.799
blew the whistle?

15:12.799 --> 15:13.960
In various ways.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.600
I'm all ears.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.639
Disturbances. Apparitions.

15:17.639 --> 15:19.480
Ectoplasm? Yes.

15:19.480 --> 15:20.759
Ectoplasm?

15:20.759 --> 15:22.279
Your rooms are through here.

15:22.279 --> 15:24.679
I'm afraid I don't have
space for you, Father.

15:24.679 --> 15:26.919
You'll have to sleep on the couch.

15:26.919 --> 15:30.240
I doubt if any of us will get
much sleep tonight.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.080
OMINOUS YELLING AND SCREAMING

15:33.080 --> 15:34.840
What in God's name?

15:36.080 --> 15:37.759
Where's it coming from?

15:37.759 --> 15:39.360
Everywhere.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.840
Ah!

15:45.840 --> 15:49.399
What, is it? I felt something
on my neck. Breathing.

15:49.399 --> 15:51.519
Another draft? It wasn't a draft.

15:51.519 --> 15:54.200
It was hot. It was panting.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.639
Philip, where are you? Speak to me.

15:57.639 --> 16:00.240
Is this a trick, Wiseman?
I won't be fooled.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.879
I'll recite an incantation.

16:01.879 --> 16:04.000
Wait here. Destroy that whistle.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.399
It's the only way.

16:06.679 --> 16:10.679
That infernal instrument
chased him away.

16:10.679 --> 16:13.840
OMINOUS SCREAMS

16:29.159 --> 16:30.480
Philip?

16:44.559 --> 16:47.039
Mother? Mother?

16:53.919 --> 16:56.159
WHIRRING

17:14.279 --> 17:15.920
Why?

17:15.920 --> 17:18.880
For my daughter.
And my grandchildren.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.720
I don't understand.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.480
They need the money.

17:22.480 --> 17:23.920
I've lost everything.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.319
Lost?

17:25.319 --> 17:26.880
Bad investments.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.160
The house is being repossessed.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.680
Even the ghosts will have
to move out.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.240
This is not funny.

17:33.240 --> 17:35.079
People are being deceived.

17:35.079 --> 17:36.920
People who want to be deceived.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.400
People who deceive
themselves every day.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.400
Gullible fools?
With more money than sense.

17:44.240 --> 17:47.759
No. You are exploiting
people's beliefs...

17:47.759 --> 17:52.799
Exploiting their...? Remind me,
how much is the Vatican worth?

17:54.039 --> 17:57.039
Tell the truth.
Or I will do it myself.

17:59.720 --> 18:01.359
No, wait!

18:03.759 --> 18:06.960
Philip? Speak to me.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.000
THUNDER CRACKS

18:10.720 --> 18:13.319
She is a widow,
bringing up two children alone.

18:13.319 --> 18:16.759
If you expose me, she will suffer.
They will suffer.

18:16.759 --> 18:19.240
No shoes on their feet.
No food on the table.

18:19.240 --> 18:22.000
And will you tell your daughter how
you came by this money

18:22.000 --> 18:26.079
or will you be too ashamed?
You know this is wrong.

18:26.079 --> 18:28.839
Possibly, yes. But I'm a parent,

18:28.839 --> 18:31.920
and a grandparent,
and I will do anything to...

18:31.920 --> 18:34.440
OMINOUS WHISTLING

18:47.440 --> 18:48.839
Your demon's missing.

18:48.839 --> 18:50.359
What?

18:50.359 --> 18:55.200
OMINOUS WHISTLING

18:58.519 --> 19:01.359
THUD AND SCREAM

19:13.079 --> 19:15.559
Ah! Ah!

19:20.319 --> 19:21.359
Huh!

19:26.880 --> 19:29.759
OMINOUS SCREAMS

19:33.440 --> 19:35.279
Hello? Yes.

19:36.839 --> 19:39.160
Police.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.359
Yes, I'd like to report a murder.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.599
Willow House.

19:45.839 --> 19:47.640
Hello? Hello?

19:50.640 --> 19:52.279
Must be the storm.

19:52.279 --> 19:54.039
It isn't the storm.

19:54.039 --> 19:55.480
Then, what?

19:55.480 --> 19:57.640
An evil spirit.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.240
One I've encountered before.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.680
A trickster. Duplicitous. Cruel.

20:02.680 --> 20:07.319
What happened here was not
caused by an evil spirit.

20:07.319 --> 20:10.160
Are you blind? It's been plaguing us
all night.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.720
It killed the Professor.

20:11.720 --> 20:14.640
I believe he was killed
by someone in this room.

20:14.640 --> 20:18.720
Just because you're in costume,
does not make you an authority.

20:18.720 --> 20:23.160
And as for the disturbances,
You have all been tricked.

20:23.160 --> 20:25.799
OMINOUS SCREAMS

20:25.799 --> 20:28.279
Does that sound like a trick to you?

20:28.279 --> 20:31.200
Would you be so kind
as to follow me?

20:32.440 --> 20:35.000
WHISPERS, ECHOING

20:58.279 --> 21:01.200
Is that necessary?
It's the only way.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.559
The only way.

21:12.240 --> 21:16.680
TIMERS TICKING

21:30.720 --> 21:32.200
What is it?

21:32.200 --> 21:34.079
A timer.

21:34.079 --> 21:37.079
Or rather, six separate timers.

21:38.559 --> 21:42.720
ALARM RINGS,
OMINOUS SCREAMS BEGIN

21:46.119 --> 21:50.000
What about what we saw?
The apparition.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.640
A film projector and mirrors.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.880
And the breathing on my neck?
That wasn't a trick.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.039
You were scared.

21:56.039 --> 21:59.039
Under those circumstances,
the mind often plays tricks.

21:59.039 --> 22:00.759
I didn't imagine it.

22:00.759 --> 22:02.880
Oh, face it. He was a fraud.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.680
And he fooled us all.

22:04.680 --> 22:07.640
Rotten son of a...
No-one deserves that.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.519
Someone clearly thinks otherwise.

22:09.519 --> 22:12.519
I think we should stick together
until the police arrive.

22:12.519 --> 22:14.279
We don't even know
if they're coming.

22:14.279 --> 22:16.160
Where's your mother?

22:16.160 --> 22:17.359
Mother?

22:20.559 --> 22:22.200
Mother?!

22:24.119 --> 22:25.480
This way.

22:25.480 --> 22:27.240
Dorothy?

22:31.440 --> 22:32.839
Dorothy?

22:39.759 --> 22:42.640
Mother, please don't disappear
like that.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.759
I wasn't going to listen to
any more of his twaddle.

22:44.759 --> 22:46.359
You still think it's an evil spirit?

22:46.359 --> 22:48.880
Even after what you've just
been shown?

22:48.880 --> 22:52.079
Just because the professor was
playing tricks,

22:52.079 --> 22:54.400
does not mean there isn't
evil in this house.

22:54.400 --> 22:58.000
Perhaps it was his belittling of it,
his mockery of it,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.839
that made the spirits angry,
and that's why it chose him.

23:00.839 --> 23:02.480
His death was a message.

23:04.160 --> 23:06.319
Brandy, anyone? Mine's a double.

23:10.400 --> 23:13.240
I sense you don't like me very much.

23:13.240 --> 23:17.240
People like you have always
demonised people like us.

23:17.240 --> 23:20.279
The clairvoyants.
I can't deny the truth in that.

23:20.279 --> 23:24.759
Tortured us. Burned us.
Condemned us to the fires of hell.

23:24.759 --> 23:27.759
Historically,
we have much to be ashamed of.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.880
Do you think I killed him?

23:33.160 --> 23:35.039
I have reached no such conclusion.

23:36.039 --> 23:39.839
However, there was a distinct smell
of cloves

23:39.839 --> 23:42.400
near where Robert was killed.

23:42.400 --> 23:45.279
I passed by a few moments before.

23:45.279 --> 23:47.759
That's hardly a smoking gun.

23:47.759 --> 23:51.240
Did you see anyone?
No, but I felt it.

23:52.359 --> 23:55.880
It was everywhere.
It still is.

23:55.880 --> 24:00.279
And before the night is out,
it will have taken us all.

24:00.279 --> 24:02.319
One by one.

KETTLE WHISTLES

24:10.480 --> 24:12.440
The telephones aren't working

24:12.440 --> 24:15.920
and the wireless says all the
roads are closed.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.200
It feels like the end of the world.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.400
It'll pass. Don't worry.

24:24.319 --> 24:26.720
I had the most awful nightmare.
Me too.

24:26.720 --> 24:30.759
Something about...
Father Brown was in danger.

24:30.759 --> 24:34.079
It was just a dream.
What was yours about?

24:34.079 --> 24:38.160
I can't remember.
Well, I hope he's all right.

24:38.160 --> 24:41.559
He is, he's... He's probably
still at his friend's house.

24:41.559 --> 24:42.759
Perfectly safe.

We'll be all right.

25:07.599 --> 25:09.319
Do you think I have the gift?

25:14.519 --> 25:17.799
I believe we ALL have a gift.
Don't dodge the question.

25:17.799 --> 25:20.599
Do you think I have the gift
of mediumship?

25:20.599 --> 25:24.440
Or do you think I'm a fraud, too?
No.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.559
I don't think you're a fraud.

25:26.559 --> 25:28.240
Deluded, perhaps?

25:30.160 --> 25:33.960
That's what people thought
when I first heard the voices.

25:35.079 --> 25:37.440
That it was grief over my husband.

25:37.440 --> 25:39.640
The tragic circumstances.

25:41.200 --> 25:45.759
Killed whilst driving
his pregnant wife to hospital.

25:47.319 --> 25:51.319
Giving birth whilst the only man
I'd ever loved was

25:51.319 --> 25:53.200
dying in the next room.

25:55.559 --> 25:57.359
It was the worst day of my life.

25:58.680 --> 26:00.039
I'm so sorry.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.759
But then he came back.

26:03.759 --> 26:07.640
I felt him. I heard him.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.799
Every day for 30 years.

26:12.240 --> 26:13.480
Until tonight.

26:15.279 --> 26:18.960
You can't just say that was
one long trick of the mind.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.839
A game of smoke and mirrors.

26:21.839 --> 26:23.720
Mirrors.

26:23.720 --> 26:24.960
Excuse me.

26:36.039 --> 26:38.160
What are you doing?

26:38.160 --> 26:41.839
If we're going to be stuck here,
we might as well lighten the mood.

26:41.839 --> 26:46.000
Lighten the mood?
There's a dead body on the stairs.

Everything's going to be all right.
It's going to be all right.

28:03.440 --> 28:05.440
I feel safer already.

28:06.720 --> 28:10.279
I don't think Robert Wiseman
was the intended victim.

I think it was...

28:30.279 --> 28:32.039
Come back, don't leave me, please.

You're letting it know

Get your hands off me!

28:51.799 --> 28:54.000
It was one of you! Steady, now.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.400
Empty your pockets.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.119
What do you expect to find?
The whistle.

28:58.119 --> 29:00.799
Maybe you killed her,
and this is all just a front.

29:00.799 --> 29:02.240
How dare you?!

29:02.240 --> 29:05.240
Or perhaps it's not a front.
Maybe you're in denial,

29:05.240 --> 29:07.519
you can't face the fact that you
finally did in

29:07.519 --> 29:09.480
your domineering, crackpot mother.

29:28.960 --> 29:31.759
Bumping off his mother,
I can understand -

29:31.759 --> 29:34.079
but why kill the Professor?

29:34.079 --> 29:36.720
It was a case of mistaken identity.

29:36.720 --> 29:39.440
He mistook the Professor
for his mother?

29:39.440 --> 29:43.400
The killer thought they saw Dorothy
in the mirror on the staircase -

29:43.400 --> 29:45.759
only it was a reflection of
a second mirror,

29:45.759 --> 29:47.279
pointing to another room.

29:47.279 --> 29:50.160
So, he was expecting his mother,

29:50.160 --> 29:53.759
but it was Wiseman
who appeared on the stairs? Yes.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.039
What bad luck!

29:56.039 --> 29:59.240
But I don't think we should assume
that Archie's the killer.

29:59.240 --> 30:01.440
What are you talking about?
Of course he did it!

30:01.440 --> 30:04.319
His relationship with his mother
was clearly...unhealthy.

30:04.319 --> 30:06.119
And he had the whistle.

30:06.119 --> 30:08.799
Which could have been planted -
after all,

30:08.799 --> 30:11.400
why demand we turn out our pockets
if he knew he had it?

30:11.400 --> 30:15.160
Why would any of us want
to murder her? I don't know.

30:15.160 --> 30:18.599
But whoever killed Dorothy
didn't just want her dead.

30:18.599 --> 30:21.480
They wanted her to suffer,
to feel abandoned,

30:21.480 --> 30:25.000
the whistle chasing away the only
comfort she had -

30:25.000 --> 30:27.079
the spirit of her late husband.

30:27.079 --> 30:30.759
Whoever killed her hated her.
PHONE RINGS

Excuse me.

Hello?

30:43.000 --> 30:44.839
It's the police.

30:47.440 --> 30:50.839
Yes, I'd like to report two murders.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.039
Yes, two.

30:54.759 --> 30:56.200
Willow House.

30:57.559 --> 31:03.079
And I think you should know,
the murderer is still in the house.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.720
They say there are trees
blocking the road,

31:12.720 --> 31:15.119
but they will be here
as soon as they can.

31:15.119 --> 31:17.039
The storm's dying down.

31:17.039 --> 31:19.000
It's going to be light soon.

31:20.839 --> 31:23.119
I'm not going to wait for the
police, I have things to do.

31:23.119 --> 31:25.319
You can't leave the scene
of a double murder.

31:25.319 --> 31:27.839
The police won't need me,
you can tell them what happened.

31:27.839 --> 31:30.839
Besides, we caught the culprit -
we did their job for them.

31:30.839 --> 31:32.480
I'll see you out.

31:35.319 --> 31:39.160
That breath on your neck wasn't your
mind playing tricks, was it?

31:39.160 --> 31:42.319
It was another lie to torment her.

31:42.319 --> 31:46.480
You fancy yourself a bit of a
sleuth, don't you? How peculiar.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.480
A sleuthing priest.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.359
Strangest thing I've seen all night.

31:52.680 --> 31:55.000
She did it.
How do you know?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.799
The lipstick on her sleeve.
So what?

31:57.799 --> 32:00.799
When the lights were out,
she slipped out, blew the whistle,

32:00.799 --> 32:03.279
and then wiped it on her sleeve to
remove the lipstick.

32:03.279 --> 32:05.839
But how could she plant it in his
pocket? It was pitch-black.

32:05.839 --> 32:07.640
She didn't do it in the dark.

32:07.640 --> 32:09.839
She did it
when she went to comfort him.

32:15.880 --> 32:18.279
We think it's best
you wait for the police.

32:18.279 --> 32:19.680
What has he been telling you?

32:19.680 --> 32:22.759
Nothing that I wouldn't have deduced
for myself, eventually.

32:22.759 --> 32:27.200
For example, how did you get
lipstick

32:27.200 --> 32:29.279
on the sleeve of your blouse?

32:30.880 --> 32:32.880
That's not lipstick, it's blood.

32:32.880 --> 32:35.599
It's everywhere tonight,
in case you hadn't noticed.

32:35.599 --> 32:40.359
Nevertheless, as ranking officer, I
must insist you wait for the police.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.240
Fine.

33:01.039 --> 33:02.279
Move.

33:10.599 --> 33:11.799
In there.

33:18.039 --> 33:21.559
What did she do to you?
Why do you hate her so much?

33:21.559 --> 33:25.559
Whatever she did,
it must have hurt you deeply.

33:37.960 --> 33:39.279
Lilith?

33:47.680 --> 33:50.000
GAS HISSES

34:00.400 --> 34:01.839
Lilith?

34:05.599 --> 34:07.119
Lilith!

34:09.440 --> 34:11.159
Tell me about your mother.

34:14.039 --> 34:18.280
You told Dorothy she helped her
through a difficult time.

34:20.760 --> 34:24.760
Why kill someone
who gave your mother such solace?

34:24.760 --> 34:26.360
Solace?!

34:27.480 --> 34:29.639
You want to know what she did to me?

34:29.639 --> 34:32.880
You want to know
why I hated her so much?

34:32.880 --> 34:35.000
Yes. I do.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.119
GAS HISSES

34:52.480 --> 34:57.800
When I was ten, my three-year-old
sister went missing.

34:57.800 --> 35:01.320
The police couldn't find her,
so my mother turned to Dorothy.

35:02.679 --> 35:04.840
She contacted the spirit world.

35:08.360 --> 35:10.360
She told her
that my sister was dead.

35:11.960 --> 35:16.360
Naturally, my mother was
grief-stricken. We all were.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.639
But at least she had Dorothy.

35:19.639 --> 35:21.480
For years.

35:21.480 --> 35:22.519
Every day.

35:23.639 --> 35:26.320
Communicating
with her dead daughter.

35:27.679 --> 35:31.920
It wasn't long before she lost
all interest in the living.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.719
My father left.

35:35.639 --> 35:37.079
I don't blame him.

35:38.159 --> 35:42.199
We were...invisible to her.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.639
Like we were the ghosts.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.599
How awful for you.

35:48.599 --> 35:51.960
You haven't heard the best part,
the kick in the teeth.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.800
Your sister was still alive.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.760
Found seven years later,

35:59.760 --> 36:02.599
raised by a childless couple
who had abducted her.

36:02.599 --> 36:05.719
It was all over the newspapers.
I read about it.

36:05.719 --> 36:08.840
Of course, Dorothy wouldn't admit
she was a fraud.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.039
She claimed she'd been tricked

36:11.039 --> 36:14.239
by an evil spirit masquerading
as my sister.

36:14.239 --> 36:18.159
The same spirit
she believed was here tonight.

36:18.159 --> 36:20.519
And my mother believed her.

36:20.519 --> 36:22.639
Thanked her, even.

36:25.039 --> 36:27.159
When I laid eyes on her tonight...

36:28.559 --> 36:31.480
..even as we embraced,
I knew I was going to kill her.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.280
I'm sorry for the loss
you've suffered. I truly am.

36:38.679 --> 36:40.679
But Dorothy wasn't a fraud.

36:42.039 --> 36:44.480
She truly believed she had a gift.

36:44.480 --> 36:48.280
She was a vulture,
preying on the grief-stricken.

36:50.760 --> 36:54.400
You saw how she spoke to the spirit
of her dead husband.

36:56.039 --> 36:58.800
She was deluded,
but she wasn't a monster.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.440
She was an innocent.

37:04.559 --> 37:07.960
Like all the others
you've harmed here tonight.

37:12.760 --> 37:16.360
Is this the part where you tell me
to seek salvation?

37:16.360 --> 37:20.639
I would do, if I thought
that you believed in the afterlife.

37:22.519 --> 37:24.039
But you don't, do you?

37:25.519 --> 37:28.679
That's why you were so cavalier
with the whistle.

37:28.679 --> 37:31.199
I haven't believed for a long time.

37:32.639 --> 37:36.360
And yet,
you make a living from the occult.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.440
You'd be amazed at what the gullible

37:38.440 --> 37:40.559
are willing to pay for
a lucky charm.

37:40.559 --> 37:43.039
You have turned into what you
despise.

37:44.880 --> 37:46.320
A charlatan...

37:48.199 --> 37:49.679
..and a murderer.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.559
You may not fear judgment
in the afterlife...

37:54.840 --> 37:58.599
..but you will have to face
what you have done in this one.

38:12.679 --> 38:14.000
I'm sorry, Father.

38:16.400 --> 38:19.559
But it feels good to have got that
off my chest.

38:19.559 --> 38:20.880
Thank you.

38:20.880 --> 38:24.880
Perhaps now I can finally move on.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.480
GAS HISSES

39:24.039 --> 39:25.639
Ugh!

39:46.360 --> 39:48.599
HE COUGHS

39:48.599 --> 39:52.280
CAR APPROACHES, POLICE SIREN RINGS

39:54.719 --> 39:57.440
HOARSE COUGHING

40:00.719 --> 40:05.000
Five... Two dead... Possibly three.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.559
Gordon Bennett!

40:38.320 --> 40:41.079
So, explain to me again,
who was the first victim?

40:42.440 --> 40:44.880
Professor Robert Wiseman.

40:44.880 --> 40:47.639
And someone killed him
for his whistle...?

40:47.639 --> 40:49.360
What on Earth...?

40:49.360 --> 40:52.320
I knew something had happened.
What are you doing here?

40:52.320 --> 40:55.320
We thought you'd got stuck
in the storm. Yes, I was.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.880
And the dead bodies?

40:56.880 --> 40:59.679
Ah, I'll explain later.

40:59.679 --> 41:01.599
Well, there's no sign of a whistle,
sir.

41:01.599 --> 41:03.440
Good riddance.

41:03.440 --> 41:05.599
Father, are you all right?

41:05.599 --> 41:08.960
Yes, I'm all right.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.920
And now...

41:20.039 --> 41:22.199
I just don't understand it.
What is it?

41:22.199 --> 41:24.320
My strawberry scones. They're gone.

41:24.320 --> 41:28.079
Well, maybe you forgot to pack them.
As if I would do such a thing.

41:28.079 --> 41:29.360
Bunty.

41:35.239 --> 41:37.239
Ooh, very funny, young lady.

41:38.679 --> 41:40.320
Just joshing, Mrs M.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.719
Looks like it might rain.

41:43.719 --> 41:46.280
What are you talking about?
It's a gorgeous day.

41:46.280 --> 41:48.280
Well, you never can tell, Father.

41:48.280 --> 41:50.239
Which reminds me.

41:50.239 --> 41:51.960
I must purchase a new...

41:51.960 --> 41:53.159
BOTH: Ta-da!

41:56.119 --> 41:58.440
I wonder what it can be?!

42:06.920 --> 42:09.639
Thank you.
I think I may go for a walk.

42:09.639 --> 42:11.880
Yes, a walk would be lovely.

42:11.880 --> 42:13.639
Alone.

42:13.639 --> 42:15.360
Oh. Of course.

42:16.880 --> 42:20.239
He just isn't right. No.
Not since the night of the storm.

42:20.239 --> 42:22.079
I can still hear you.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.760
HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLE

43:10.119 --> 43:17.440
ECHOING WHISPERING
Whistle and I will come...
