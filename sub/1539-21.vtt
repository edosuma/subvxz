<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:03.735 --> 00:05.303
You need to leave
Ms. Kringle alone.

00:05.305 --> 00:07.239
I get it now.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.507
You got a thing
for my girl.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.242
Oh! (groans)

00:12.411 --> 00:13.411
Oh, dear.

00:13.413 --> 00:15.647
(laughs)

00:15.649 --> 00:17.315
Who sent you?

00:17.317 --> 00:19.684
You want me to tell Bunderslaw
that you're onto him?

00:19.686 --> 00:21.686
(grunts)
No! (screams)

00:23.523 --> 00:24.656
I'm Bruce Wayne.

00:24.658 --> 00:25.724
Sid Bunderslaw.

00:27.226 --> 00:29.861
GORDON: <i>The people of Gotham
deserve to know</i>

00:29.863 --> 00:32.229
that there's a serial killer
in their midst.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.331
I'm coming after you.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.534
<i>He murders the loved ones</i>

Morning.
How'd you sleep?

01:02.529 --> 01:05.030
The hour we slept?

01:05.032 --> 01:06.531
Great.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.934
You hungry?
I have quiche.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.702
No, thanks.

01:10.704 --> 01:11.937
At least have some coffee.

01:11.939 --> 01:13.872
Let me tell you about the day

01:13.874 --> 01:15.340
I have planned for us.

01:15.342 --> 01:17.342
I think I'm just gonna
get out of here.

01:17.344 --> 01:19.644
Just wait.

01:21.514 --> 01:24.182
We had fun last night, right?

01:28.988 --> 01:30.221
Stay.

01:32.191 --> 01:34.459
Listen, you don't
have to do this.

01:34.461 --> 01:35.927
Do what?

01:35.929 --> 01:38.196
Last night
at the ball,

01:38.198 --> 01:39.598
you talked a good game.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.933
But let's not pretend
this is more than what it is.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.270
Barbara, I'm not
pretending with you.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.671
I want you

01:46.673 --> 01:49.574
to stay with me.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.176
I don't think so.

01:51.178 --> 01:53.345
Just... wait,
wait, wait.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.647
Let go.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.249
Look...

01:58.251 --> 02:02.287
I was pretending
with you.

02:02.289 --> 02:05.724
But not in the
way you think.

02:09.095 --> 02:10.595
(sighs)

02:13.633 --> 02:16.167
The night we met....

02:17.470 --> 02:19.337
...I was going to kill you.

02:22.541 --> 02:24.943
That's not funny.
But then...

02:24.945 --> 02:29.047
I saw something in you,

02:29.049 --> 02:31.549
Barbara, I saw...

02:31.551 --> 02:33.985
the real you.

02:37.423 --> 02:41.893
You are the woman
that I have been searching for.

02:45.731 --> 02:48.233
(whispers):
You're lying.

02:51.003 --> 02:54.506
I'm gonna let you go now,

02:54.508 --> 02:59.411
and you're going to sit down
and have breakfast with me.

03:10.623 --> 03:12.123
(grunting)

03:12.125 --> 03:13.324
Come on.

03:15.227 --> 03:17.095
No!
(whimpering)

03:18.197 --> 03:20.465
So I do it
the hard way.

03:29.608 --> 03:32.043
Hey. How are you doing?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.611
Been better. You seen Harvey?

03:33.613 --> 03:34.646
No.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.548
Any word on Barbara?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.450
They haven't found her body yet,

03:38.452 --> 03:40.618
so there's a chance
she's still alive.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.954
When's the last
time you slept?

03:42.956 --> 03:44.055
I don't know.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.957
Last time you ate?
I don't know.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.259
I know better than to
try to get you to sleep,

03:48.261 --> 03:49.561
but you really
should eat something.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.729
I'm not hungry.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.831
Jim...

03:52.833 --> 03:54.466
it's not your fault.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.571
I did this. I pressed Loeb,
he sent the Ogre after me,

03:59.573 --> 04:01.439
and I didn't stop.

04:01.441 --> 04:03.742
It was bad enough
I knowingly put you in danger.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.276
I didn't even think of Barbara.

04:05.278 --> 04:07.846
You were doing your job.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.814
But I should've known.
How?

04:09.816 --> 04:11.349
Y-You weren't together.

04:11.351 --> 04:12.517
Do you blame yourself

04:12.519 --> 04:14.519
for falling out of love?

04:14.521 --> 04:15.887
Lee, it's my responsibility.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.189
There's nothing you can say
that changes that.

04:18.190 --> 04:19.690
Whatever happens to Barbara,

04:19.692 --> 04:21.860
it's on me.

04:21.862 --> 04:22.927
I understand.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.362
BULLOCK:
Jimbo!

04:24.364 --> 04:26.664
Meet Jake the JV pimp.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.366
He's been bragging
on the streets that

04:28.368 --> 04:30.201
he knows who the Ogre is.
I keep telling you,

04:30.203 --> 04:32.036
man, you been lied to;
I don't know nothing.

04:32.038 --> 04:33.038
BULLOCK:
Yeah?

04:33.039 --> 04:35.106
We'll see about that.

04:46.886 --> 04:49.788
(wheels squeaking softly)

05:04.603 --> 05:06.671
(exhales)

05:14.747 --> 05:16.514
Okeydoke.

05:16.516 --> 05:19.584
No body, no crime.
No body, no crime.

05:21.487 --> 05:24.889
Nope. Never seen him before.

05:26.458 --> 05:29.627
We think this is a serial killer
called the Ogre.

05:29.629 --> 05:31.596
He's kidnapped a woman,

05:31.598 --> 05:33.898
and he's gonna kill her
unless we find him first.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.400
Bummer.

05:35.402 --> 05:36.968
Just so you understand,

05:36.970 --> 05:39.671
the lady in question
is a real good

05:39.673 --> 05:40.872
friend of ours.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.675
Supposing,
for the sake of argument,

05:43.677 --> 05:46.277
I did see him before.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.745
What's she worth?

05:49.582 --> 05:51.349
What's she worth?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.351
Yeah, you know,

05:53.353 --> 05:56.120
if you had to assign
a dollar amount.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.025
Harvey, I'm about
to violate departmental policy

06:01.027 --> 06:04.596
on interrogation techniques.

06:04.598 --> 06:08.032
Think I saw some donuts outside
with my name all over them.

06:09.568 --> 06:11.803
Hey, now. C-Calm yourself.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.085
There's no need
to get carried...

06:16.008 --> 06:17.876
Jake worked as a
barman at a brothel

06:17.878 --> 06:19.177
called the Foxglove.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.813
Said the Ogre was a regular.
Can't give us a location.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.982
Yeah, 'cause they never
use the same place twice.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.984
What, you know it?
Not personally.

06:25.986 --> 06:29.287
The Foxglove is very
high-class, very extreme.

06:29.289 --> 06:31.055
You got to know someone
who knows someone.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.991
Uh, I might know someone.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.626
Oh. You talking
Penguin?

06:34.628 --> 06:37.161
If you get any deeper with
that clown, he will own you.

06:37.163 --> 06:39.130
I don't have a choice;
the Ogre has Barbara.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.465
Let me shake
a few trees.

06:40.467 --> 06:41.833
Take the time,
grab some "Z" s.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.501
You're burnt!

06:44.470 --> 06:46.838
First one was the hardest.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.740
But it wasn't her fault.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.775
She just wasn't the one.

06:50.777 --> 06:53.144
I also couldn't let her go.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.380
Still, it strengthened
my resolve

06:55.382 --> 06:57.749
to never stop
till I found my soul mate...

06:57.751 --> 07:00.184
Person I could
share everything with.

07:02.454 --> 07:06.524
I think that person is you,
Barbara, but I need your help.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.793
So...

07:08.795 --> 07:11.729
let's begin again, shall we?

07:11.731 --> 07:13.798
(whimpering)

07:15.401 --> 07:16.701
(gasps)

07:26.475 --> 07:29.310
This just, uh...

07:29.312 --> 07:31.946
came for you by messenger,
Master Bruce.

07:35.050 --> 07:37.118
Thank you.

07:40.022 --> 07:42.023
Right, well, I'll...

07:42.025 --> 07:44.025
I'll just be off.

07:44.027 --> 07:45.526
Do you want company?

07:46.929 --> 07:48.730
To identify Reggie?

07:48.732 --> 07:51.332
No, I don't think so.
Best done alone.

07:51.334 --> 07:54.469
I'm sorry, Alfred.

07:54.471 --> 07:56.471
I know he was your friend.

07:56.473 --> 07:58.273
Just doesn't
make any sense.

07:58.275 --> 08:01.109
Reggie topping himself
like that.

08:01.111 --> 08:02.944
You said he fell
out of a window.

08:02.946 --> 08:04.512
He might've been drinking,
lost his balance.

08:04.514 --> 08:05.880
(scoffs)

08:05.882 --> 08:08.650
No, Reggie, he was a legend.

08:08.652 --> 08:11.986
He could be blind drunk
and walk a tightrope.

08:13.522 --> 08:16.758
Doesn't matter
what he was like in the end.

08:16.760 --> 08:19.360
I want to see he gets
a proper send-off.

08:22.798 --> 08:24.866
I'll see you this evening, sir.

08:30.806 --> 08:32.874
(door closes)

08:49.992 --> 08:53.528
LIDIA: <i>What, your boss
doesn't trust his partners?</i>

08:53.530 --> 08:55.363
It's called
due diligence.

08:55.365 --> 08:57.599
He just wants me
to look the place over.

08:57.601 --> 08:59.033
So look.

08:59.035 --> 09:02.704
I got a gravy going...
Special party today.

09:02.706 --> 09:04.472
Don't let me keep you.

09:04.474 --> 09:06.541
(chuckles softly)
Piece of work.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.288
GILZEAN: <i>I'll put the pistol
under the bar,</i>

09:20.290 --> 09:22.357
<i>machine gun behind the juke.</i>

09:23.959 --> 09:25.793
All Connor and
his guy got to do

09:25.795 --> 09:27.595
is get to them.

09:27.597 --> 09:29.597
The day is finally here.
(chuckles)

09:29.599 --> 09:30.599
(door opens)

09:30.600 --> 09:32.500
Maroni...

09:32.502 --> 09:34.402
(chuckles)
Jim.

09:34.404 --> 09:36.905
So lovely to see you.

09:36.907 --> 09:40.742
To what do I owe this
wonderful surprise?

09:40.744 --> 09:42.443
I need to know
where the Foxglove is.

09:42.445 --> 09:44.846
And I need
an invitation.

09:44.848 --> 09:46.748
(laughs)

09:46.750 --> 09:48.750
Well, someone's in a mood.

09:48.752 --> 09:51.119
Can you help me out?
Yes or no.

09:52.621 --> 09:56.124
Jim, I do so love
our give-and-take relationship.

09:56.126 --> 09:58.927
But it's starting to feel
a bit one-sided.

09:58.929 --> 10:00.562
Fine.

10:00.564 --> 10:02.497
I'll owe you a favor.

10:02.499 --> 10:03.998
You already do.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.001
Then I'll owe you
another.

10:07.003 --> 10:10.271
Cards on the table.

10:10.273 --> 10:12.040
The Foxglove makes
a lot of money

10:12.042 --> 10:13.942
for some
important f...

10:15.844 --> 10:18.012
(gasping)

10:18.014 --> 10:20.615
You think you know who I am.

10:20.617 --> 10:22.884
What I'm capable of.

10:22.886 --> 10:24.852
You have no idea.

10:24.854 --> 10:26.454
Today is an important day
for me...

10:28.290 --> 10:31.459
...so I will accommodate
your request.

10:31.461 --> 10:35.296
But, Detective, mark my words.

10:35.298 --> 10:38.099
You owe me a big favor.

10:44.707 --> 10:47.141
WOMAN: <i>Here we have the Physical
Operations department.</i>

10:47.143 --> 10:49.744
The Physical
Operations department

10:49.746 --> 10:51.846
handles logistics
for the corporation,

10:51.848 --> 10:53.781
management of our
properties, offices...

10:53.783 --> 10:56.184
Excuse me, I need
to use the restroom.

10:56.186 --> 10:58.753
Of course, Mr. Wayne.
It's right here.

10:58.755 --> 11:00.421
Thank you.

11:08.497 --> 11:10.298
(fire alarm ringing)

11:13.269 --> 11:16.537
The Foxglove is in the old
Klondike Building on Mayflower.

11:16.539 --> 11:18.439
You score a ticket?
Yep.

11:18.441 --> 11:19.507
But only one.

11:19.509 --> 11:21.976
I figure you go in,
pose as a john,

11:21.978 --> 11:23.544
find something to bust them on,

11:23.546 --> 11:26.147
then we squeeze them
till they talk.

11:26.149 --> 11:27.949
Smart move sending me, hmm?

11:27.951 --> 11:30.418
You couldn't look more like a
cop if you wore a blue uniform.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.220
You got something to wear?

11:32.222 --> 11:34.422
You, uh, are gonna need
to fit in.
Don't worry.

11:34.424 --> 11:36.424
Alvarez busted some guys
smuggling Italian suits

11:36.426 --> 11:38.960
last week, and a couple
fell in my locker

11:38.962 --> 11:41.429
on their way to
the evidence room.

11:41.431 --> 11:43.064
(snickers)

11:43.066 --> 11:45.433
JASON: I'm sorry
I left you alone,

11:45.435 --> 11:49.070
but you needed
time to think,

11:49.072 --> 11:51.773
to accept that this was real.

11:51.775 --> 11:54.175
This apartment is soundproofed,
by the way,

11:54.177 --> 11:56.244
so save your lungs.

12:02.584 --> 12:04.652
(chuckles)

12:06.388 --> 12:08.456
(panting)

12:10.893 --> 12:13.961
Look at me.
My hands are shaking.

12:13.963 --> 12:15.763
That's never happened before

12:15.765 --> 12:17.932
with any of the other women
that I've had here.

12:17.934 --> 12:20.268
You know
why that is?

12:20.270 --> 12:21.936
(shuddering exhale)

12:22.905 --> 12:25.073
Do you know why

12:25.075 --> 12:27.041
that is?

12:27.043 --> 12:29.544
You're a psycho.

12:29.546 --> 12:31.612
I don't know
what you're thinking.

12:35.284 --> 12:38.920
It's because
I always somehow knew

12:38.922 --> 12:43.124
that deep down,
the others weren't the one.

12:43.126 --> 12:45.126
(grunts)
They weren't the one.

12:45.128 --> 12:47.962
(panting)

12:49.765 --> 12:51.599
I want this to work, Barbara.

12:57.740 --> 12:59.640
You're scared.

12:59.642 --> 13:02.076
It's okay.

13:04.513 --> 13:06.347
Jim will find...

13:06.349 --> 13:07.749
(grunting)

13:07.751 --> 13:10.218
(crying)

13:10.220 --> 13:14.055
The only way you're going
to make me angry is

13:14.057 --> 13:16.457
if you mention his name.

13:19.728 --> 13:21.796
(panting)

13:27.002 --> 13:29.904
Drink this.

13:29.906 --> 13:32.607
It's water.
You're dehydrated.

13:41.751 --> 13:44.886
Barbara, come here.
I want you to see something.

13:49.325 --> 13:51.159
Barbara, I love you.

13:51.161 --> 13:53.728
I love you
like no one has ever loved you.

13:53.730 --> 13:55.764
But if you try to escape,

13:55.766 --> 13:57.866
I will chain you
to the ceiling and gut you.

13:57.868 --> 14:00.902
Now come... here.

14:06.175 --> 14:08.243
(sniffles)

14:17.720 --> 14:19.787
Are those...

14:19.789 --> 14:21.389
When you're
looking for love,

14:21.391 --> 14:23.124
you have to
kiss a lot of frogs.

14:23.126 --> 14:26.861
Still, I-I should be thankful.

14:26.863 --> 14:28.563
They led me to you.

14:28.565 --> 14:31.266
(shuddering breaths)

14:31.268 --> 14:33.334
All those women...

14:35.271 --> 14:38.406
...they died here?

14:38.408 --> 14:40.942
You killed them...

14:40.944 --> 14:43.211
here?

14:43.213 --> 14:45.213
Yes.

14:47.182 --> 14:49.250
(glass shatters)

14:50.586 --> 14:51.753
(shallow gasping)

14:51.755 --> 14:53.488
Don't worry.

14:53.490 --> 14:55.590
I'm gonna set you free.

14:55.592 --> 14:58.326
You're the one,
Barbara.

14:58.328 --> 15:00.395
You're the one.

15:03.999 --> 15:06.067

15:32.761 --> 15:34.829

15:51.748 --> 15:53.981
BUNDERSLAW:
Hello, Bruce.

15:53.983 --> 15:56.617
I've been expecting you.

16:04.991 --> 16:08.561
Ever since your friend
borrowed my key,

16:08.563 --> 16:10.496
I've been expecting you.

16:10.498 --> 16:12.164
Even canceled my trip.

16:12.166 --> 16:13.532
Cookie?

16:15.168 --> 16:17.169
When I was a boy,

16:17.171 --> 16:19.939
I'd always take a cookie
when I had the chance.

16:22.876 --> 16:25.077
You hired a man
to kill Alfred.

16:25.079 --> 16:27.246
I hired your
guardian's comrade

16:27.248 --> 16:28.647
to find out what you knew.

16:28.649 --> 16:31.717
I never intended harm
to come to anyone.

16:34.254 --> 16:37.089
I told the board
you were a special case,

16:37.091 --> 16:38.824
that you need the talk

16:38.826 --> 16:40.092
early.

16:40.094 --> 16:42.294
The talk?

16:42.296 --> 16:45.464
Bruce, when members of the Wayne
family reach a certain age,

16:45.466 --> 16:48.200
some facts of life and business
are explained...

16:48.202 --> 16:50.870
Wayne Enterprises
is committing serious crimes.

16:50.872 --> 16:52.972
Oh, my, yes.

16:52.974 --> 16:55.508
This is
a multinational corporation

16:55.510 --> 16:57.943
operating in hundreds
of jurisdictions.

16:57.945 --> 17:01.347
We do our best to subvert
all of them if it means profits.

17:01.349 --> 17:05.317
So... you admit it?

17:05.319 --> 17:06.952
Just like
your father.

17:06.954 --> 17:10.789
He came in with his secret
files, demanding justice.

17:10.790 --> 17:12.124
At first.

17:12.126 --> 17:14.292
Then he changed
his mind.

17:14.295 --> 17:15.627
You're lying.

17:15.630 --> 17:16.962
Your father

17:16.964 --> 17:20.065
came to understand
the reality of this business.

17:20.067 --> 17:21.599
As did his father.

17:21.602 --> 17:22.602
And as will you.

17:22.603 --> 17:24.770
My father was a good man.

17:24.771 --> 17:29.275
You have an opportunity
to live a blessed life,

17:29.277 --> 17:31.443
the life your father and mother

17:31.445 --> 17:33.879
wanted for you.

17:33.881 --> 17:37.149
I beg you to reconsider.

17:39.119 --> 17:40.286
Pardon me.

17:40.288 --> 17:41.620
Lucius, come in.

17:41.622 --> 17:43.889
Bruce Wayne,

17:43.891 --> 17:46.992
meet one of our
junior executives, Lucius Fox.

17:46.994 --> 17:48.327
There's a public relations
person out there

17:48.329 --> 17:50.329
desperately searching
for this young man.

17:50.331 --> 17:52.731
Then you'd best reunite them.

17:52.733 --> 17:54.867
Bruce,

17:54.869 --> 17:57.369
don't forget your cookie.

18:09.683 --> 18:12.685
Now...

18:12.687 --> 18:14.987
I'm going to tell you something,
and I'd appreciate

18:14.989 --> 18:17.389
if you kept your face
perfectly still.

18:17.391 --> 18:18.724
There's cameras everywhere.

18:18.726 --> 18:20.326
I know because I put them there.

18:20.328 --> 18:23.596
What I'm about to say
must be a deep secret

18:23.598 --> 18:25.731
between you and me.

18:25.733 --> 18:28.100
I knew your father well.

18:28.102 --> 18:30.035
He was a good man.

18:30.037 --> 18:32.438
He wasn't the man
the company thought he was.

18:32.440 --> 18:35.608
I don't understand you.

18:35.610 --> 18:36.942
Bruce,

18:36.944 --> 18:40.079
your father was a true Stoic.

18:40.081 --> 18:43.515
He kept his best self
hidden.

18:43.517 --> 18:46.318
That's all I'll say.

18:50.957 --> 18:52.224
(elevator bell dings)

18:52.226 --> 18:54.793
Good luck.

19:31.465 --> 19:32.931
Um, yes. Hendricks.

19:32.933 --> 19:34.066
Wait right here.

19:36.703 --> 19:38.370

19:43.577 --> 19:45.944
(gasps)
Oh, my goodness.

19:47.547 --> 19:48.914
What happened to him?
Um...

19:48.916 --> 19:51.884
axe... uh, a-accidental death.

19:51.886 --> 19:53.652
Oh.
At a sheet
metal factory.

19:53.654 --> 19:55.421
Industrial saw. Just...

19:55.423 --> 19:56.855
(imitates buzzing)

19:56.857 --> 19:59.158
Poor man.

19:59.160 --> 20:02.728
I... I don't know
how you do this job.

20:02.730 --> 20:04.563
Death all around you.

20:04.565 --> 20:05.798
(chuckles) Yes.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.333
One must have a sense of humor.

20:08.335 --> 20:10.903
The-the file?

20:10.905 --> 20:12.204
Yes.

20:16.209 --> 20:19.211
Um, Mr. Nygma,

20:19.213 --> 20:22.748
you haven't, by chance, seen,
uh, Tom... Officer Dougherty?

20:22.750 --> 20:26.251
We were... supposed
to have dinner last night.

20:26.253 --> 20:27.386
He didn't show... no surprise...

20:27.388 --> 20:28.921
Um, but I haven't
seen him today.

20:28.923 --> 20:31.123
Me neither.

20:31.125 --> 20:33.859
Oh.

20:33.861 --> 20:35.928
Excuse me. I really need
to get back to work.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.029
Oh, uh...

20:37.031 --> 20:38.230
Uh...
Now.

20:38.232 --> 20:40.299
Okay. Um...

20:43.336 --> 20:45.404
Oh, dear.

20:46.639 --> 20:49.541
You're sure...

20:49.543 --> 20:51.276
the guns are there?

20:51.278 --> 20:53.879
Butch placed
them himself.

20:53.881 --> 20:56.682
Do you remember what to say to
Maroni before you do the deed?

20:56.684 --> 21:00.152
I never saw the point
in telling a man something

21:00.154 --> 21:03.021
right before
you're gonna whack him,

21:03.023 --> 21:06.425
but you're not the first
to ask for it.

21:08.061 --> 21:10.295
I appreciate you humoring me.

21:10.297 --> 21:12.898
So how do you know
Maroni's gonna be in this bar

21:12.900 --> 21:14.733
on this exact day?

21:14.735 --> 21:16.802
I follow current events.

21:25.478 --> 21:27.713

21:31.818 --> 21:33.552
There he is.

21:35.156 --> 21:38.223
Nine years
up the river,

21:38.225 --> 21:40.259
and you get better-looking,
you big animal.

21:40.261 --> 21:42.261
Took care of myself.

21:42.263 --> 21:44.530
I was hoping you'd remember.

21:44.532 --> 21:46.865
(laughs)
Come over here. Huh?

21:46.867 --> 21:50.335
Listen, you leave the joint,
you come to Lidia's for dinner.

21:50.337 --> 21:51.770
That's tradition.

26:50.102 --> 26:52.435
He was sweet.

26:52.437 --> 26:56.272
As soon as I got into his car,
he pulled a hood over my head

26:56.274 --> 26:57.574
and tied my wrists.

26:57.576 --> 26:59.476
He took me back
to his apartment.

26:59.478 --> 27:01.711
That's where he did this.

27:01.713 --> 27:04.214
I don't know why he let me go.

27:04.216 --> 27:06.049
When was this?

27:06.051 --> 27:07.884
Almost nine years ago.
About a year before

27:07.886 --> 27:10.153
the first murder...
He was working his way up.

27:10.155 --> 27:11.654
Why didn't you go
to the police?

27:11.656 --> 27:12.956
I did.

27:12.958 --> 27:15.758
I was a hooker;
he was a rich man with no name.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.827
Anything else you can tell us?

27:17.829 --> 27:20.130
Anything about his apartment?
The smallest detail

27:20.132 --> 27:22.031
might help.

27:23.534 --> 27:26.503
The elevator opened
right into the apartment.

27:26.505 --> 27:28.505
You can see out into the city.

27:28.507 --> 27:30.006
We were in midtown.

27:30.008 --> 27:32.475
And there was
a big neon sign

27:32.477 --> 27:34.978
on the building
across the street.

27:34.980 --> 27:37.080
I could only read
the last four letters.

27:37.082 --> 27:39.182
O-Y-A-L.

27:39.184 --> 27:40.850
GORDON:
O-Y-A-L.

27:40.852 --> 27:42.852
Hmm. Loyal, royal...

27:42.854 --> 27:44.120
Royal.

27:44.122 --> 27:45.655
Gotham Royal Hotel.

27:45.657 --> 27:47.323
That's in midtown.
10th and Gainsly.

27:47.325 --> 27:48.658
Thank you, Sally.

27:48.660 --> 27:50.260
Promise me, when
you find him,

27:50.262 --> 27:52.829
don't arrest him.

27:52.831 --> 27:54.230
Kill him.

27:54.232 --> 27:57.500
You got it.

27:57.502 --> 27:59.802
(laughter, quiet chatter)

27:59.804 --> 28:02.172
Whoa, fellas, private party.

28:02.174 --> 28:04.040
CONNOR:
Just here to pay respects.

28:04.042 --> 28:06.576
MARONI: Connor from
the wild northeast.

28:06.578 --> 28:10.046
What's that old man Falcone
want now?

28:10.048 --> 28:12.048
Don Falcone sends me
with his respects,

28:12.050 --> 28:13.883
and a small gift for you

28:13.885 --> 28:15.718
and Tommy Bones
on this happy day.

28:15.720 --> 28:16.953
Cheech.

28:18.889 --> 28:20.823
MARONI: Forgive my
suspicious nature.

28:20.825 --> 28:23.927
Of course.
Can't be too careful.

28:23.929 --> 28:27.163
Come here.
Let me see this.

28:29.867 --> 28:31.701
Madre di Dios.

28:31.703 --> 28:33.603
My favorite.

28:33.605 --> 28:36.873
You tell Falcone I
appreciate the gesture.

28:36.875 --> 28:38.575
Don Falcone knew
it was a special occasion.

28:38.577 --> 28:40.243
We got time for
a drink. Lidia!

28:40.245 --> 28:41.778
Clean glasses, please.

28:41.780 --> 28:43.780
The gift comes with a message.

28:43.782 --> 28:44.881
Oh, yeah?

28:44.883 --> 28:46.783
What's that?

28:46.785 --> 28:48.585
He wants you to know
that it wasn't easy

28:48.587 --> 28:50.353
for him to decide to kill you.

28:50.355 --> 28:51.854
(guns cocking)

28:52.556 --> 28:55.124
Son of a bitch.

28:55.126 --> 28:58.061
But business is business.

28:58.063 --> 29:00.763
(guns clicking)

29:03.968 --> 29:05.868
(grunting)

29:05.870 --> 29:08.137
You believe it?

29:08.139 --> 29:10.139
You both jammed.

29:10.141 --> 29:12.175
If that ain't a sign from God,
I don't know what.

29:12.177 --> 29:13.409
Please...
Shut your mouth!

29:13.411 --> 29:14.444
Ow!
You're gonna take

29:14.446 --> 29:15.812
Don Falcone a
message from me.

29:15.814 --> 29:17.847
You're gonna let him know
that you messed up...

29:17.849 --> 29:19.315
(grunting)

29:19.317 --> 29:21.818
...and you're gonna let him know
that I'm coming for him.

29:21.820 --> 29:25.722
Of course, you don't need
to be alive to tell him that.

29:25.724 --> 29:26.856
Tommy, do the honors.

29:26.858 --> 29:28.258
CONNOR:
Wait...

29:33.897 --> 29:36.733
♪ All you punks
and all you teds ♪

29:36.735 --> 29:40.270
♪ National Front

29:40.272 --> 29:43.539

29:45.308 --> 29:46.809
Connor blew it.

29:46.811 --> 29:48.944
Maroni's still alive.

29:48.946 --> 29:51.013
This is flat.

29:52.148 --> 29:54.183
Did you not hear me?

29:54.185 --> 29:56.018
Maroni is still alive.

29:56.020 --> 29:57.686
You got to get out of town.

29:57.688 --> 29:59.922
And miss all the fun?

29:59.924 --> 30:03.025
You knew.

30:03.027 --> 30:05.394
You set him up.

30:05.396 --> 30:08.597
I took the firing pins out
of the guns before you hid them.

30:08.599 --> 30:11.133
(laughs): A spin on a trick
I learned from Maroni.

30:13.203 --> 30:16.071
But you could have
had Maroni dead.

30:16.073 --> 30:19.575
True, but I still would've been
under Falcone's thumb,

30:19.577 --> 30:23.445
and that...
has grown intolerable.

30:23.447 --> 30:26.081
No, I'd much rather
Maroni be alive,

30:26.083 --> 30:28.217
and out for blood.

30:36.626 --> 30:39.795
Alas, Officer Dougherty, she's
gonna wonder where you went.

30:41.731 --> 30:43.999
Perhaps a letter.

30:44.001 --> 30:47.803
You could say good-bye,
give her some advice.

30:47.805 --> 30:49.805
Something that might lead her

30:49.807 --> 30:52.841
to make better choices
in the future, hmm?

31:04.587 --> 31:07.889
(yelling)

31:31.347 --> 31:33.415
BULLOCK:
Jim?

31:35.185 --> 31:37.186
Place is empty.

31:37.188 --> 31:40.088
But there's something
you should see.

31:45.328 --> 31:48.363
You see anything
that connects to Barbara?

31:50.300 --> 31:52.100
Maybe she was never here.

31:52.102 --> 31:53.802
No, she was here.

31:53.804 --> 31:55.804
I can still smell
her perfume.

31:55.806 --> 31:59.841
Hey, we're gonna find this guy,

31:59.843 --> 32:02.211
but you need to
prepare yourself...

32:03.746 --> 32:06.515
...that we might not be
in time to save her.

32:06.517 --> 32:07.683
That is not an option.

32:07.685 --> 32:09.651
It's the most likely option.

32:09.653 --> 32:11.720
(phone ringing)

32:24.167 --> 32:25.334
Hello.

32:25.336 --> 32:27.302
JASON:
Detective Gordon,

32:27.304 --> 32:29.404
I assume you are the one
who triggered the alarm.

32:29.406 --> 32:31.139
You son of a bitch.
Where's Barbara?

32:31.141 --> 32:34.443
(over speakerphone):
With me, of course.

32:34.445 --> 32:35.844
If you've hurt her...

32:35.846 --> 32:37.713
She's as safe as milk.

32:37.715 --> 32:40.215
Safer than she ever was
when she was with you.

32:40.217 --> 32:41.650
(train horn blowing)

32:41.652 --> 32:43.452
What the hell does that mean?

32:43.454 --> 32:45.721
She doesn't need
your protection, Jim.

32:45.723 --> 32:47.956
Fact is, she never did.

32:47.958 --> 32:49.558
I'll see you around.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.627
Wait.
(line clicks, dial tone)

32:53.563 --> 32:54.730
He was driving.

32:54.732 --> 32:56.498
To Tahiti if he's smart.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.066
Yeah, there was
a noise, right?

32:58.068 --> 33:01.870
A thumping, like he was
going over a bridge.

33:01.872 --> 33:04.740
You know, I heard, uh, a
horn, like a train horn.

33:04.742 --> 33:06.742
Okay, so, which bridge
has a train?

33:06.744 --> 33:08.577
Um...

33:08.579 --> 33:12.247
Damn. Um... Whitecross,
but that's the upstate train.

33:12.249 --> 33:14.916
Upstate.

33:14.918 --> 33:16.985
<i>It's where her parents live.</i>

33:18.988 --> 33:21.056
(whimpering softly)

33:23.926 --> 33:25.927
Barbara, please.

33:25.929 --> 33:27.929
What's happening?

33:27.931 --> 33:31.466
JASON: What's happening is your
daughter is finally waking up.

33:34.304 --> 33:37.172
Please.

33:37.174 --> 33:39.675
Barbara, we're doing this
for you.

Barbara.

34:47.442 --> 34:49.809
What are you doing here?

35:09.463 --> 35:12.698
You're not supposed to be here.

Drop the knife,

35:55.143 --> 35:58.778
Just an ounce of pressure,
and she'll split right open.

35:58.780 --> 36:00.780
I don't want that.
Do you want that?

36:00.782 --> 36:03.116
It's gonna be all right,
Barbara.

36:03.118 --> 36:04.717
It's gonna be all right.

36:04.719 --> 36:06.753
If you cared about this woman,

36:06.755 --> 36:09.355
you never would have
come after me.

Won't be me
that slits her throat.

36:16.464 --> 36:18.898
Detective, that's gonna be you.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.433
Drop it.
BARBARA:
Jim,

36:20.435 --> 36:22.368
please.

36:22.370 --> 36:24.837
Just leave us alone.

Barbara?

36:45.559 --> 36:46.559
He's dead?

36:46.561 --> 36:48.261
Yeah. He's dead.

36:48.263 --> 36:49.996
It's gonna be okay.

36:49.998 --> 36:53.199
Look at me. Barbara?

36:55.169 --> 36:56.803
It's gonna be okay.

37:00.007 --> 37:02.074
(door opens)

37:09.183 --> 37:12.552
Alfred, I never asked you.

37:12.554 --> 37:15.388
How was it yesterday,
seeing Reggie?

37:15.390 --> 37:17.757
Not really, uh, an experience

37:17.759 --> 37:19.926
I'd care to repeat,
Master Bruce.

37:21.862 --> 37:24.764
But then again, the Reggie
I knew died years ago.

37:28.302 --> 37:29.802
Alfred, I haven't

37:29.804 --> 37:31.904
been honest
with you.

37:34.441 --> 37:36.742
After you were hurt,

37:36.744 --> 37:38.945
Selina and I went looking
for Reggie.

37:41.014 --> 37:43.082
We found him.

37:45.052 --> 37:47.053
Did you, now?

37:47.055 --> 37:49.155
He didn't jump

37:49.157 --> 37:51.991
or fall.

37:51.993 --> 37:54.060
Selina pushed him.

37:55.028 --> 37:57.663
And why did she do that?

37:57.665 --> 38:01.534
Reggie was sent here
by a man named Sid Bunderslaw.

38:01.536 --> 38:03.803
Bunderslaw works for
Wayne Enterprises.

38:03.805 --> 38:05.838
Reggie gave
us the name,

38:05.840 --> 38:09.775
but said he was gonna tell
Bunderslaw what we were doing.

38:09.777 --> 38:12.879
I see.

38:12.881 --> 38:15.081
And the rest?

38:16.049 --> 38:18.050
The charity ball...

38:18.052 --> 38:20.386
Presumably to have access
to Mr. Bunderslaw.

38:20.388 --> 38:24.323
Selina stole the key
to his office safe.

38:24.325 --> 38:27.059
I went there today.
It was empty.

38:29.263 --> 38:30.563
But Bunderslaw was
waiting for me.

38:30.565 --> 38:31.731
What did he do?
Nothing.

38:31.733 --> 38:32.733
What did he do?!

38:32.734 --> 38:33.966
Nothing!

38:33.968 --> 38:35.835
(breath quivering)

38:35.837 --> 38:38.638
But he said that my father
and grandfather

38:38.640 --> 38:41.307
knew about the illegal things
that the company was doing,

38:41.309 --> 38:43.142
and chose...

38:43.144 --> 38:45.678
They chose to stay quiet.

38:48.348 --> 38:50.449
(sighs)

38:52.219 --> 38:54.787
Your father was a good man.

38:55.756 --> 38:57.823
I know.

38:59.826 --> 39:01.994
But even good men have secrets.

39:03.797 --> 39:05.865
(applause, excited chatter)

39:07.634 --> 39:09.702
There he is.

39:11.572 --> 39:13.473
MAN: That guy right there.
MAN 2: Yeah, nice work.

39:13.475 --> 39:14.640
MAN 3:
Yeah, nice work.

39:14.642 --> 39:16.209
Congratulations. You're a hero.

39:16.211 --> 39:17.810
Yeah, it won't last.

39:17.812 --> 39:19.679
Tomorrow, they'll go
back to hating me.

39:19.681 --> 39:21.214
Well, then I'll remind them.

39:23.016 --> 39:25.051
Yesterday,
you were trying to help.

39:25.053 --> 39:26.953
I couldn't hear it. I'm sorry.

39:26.955 --> 39:30.189
I would never try
to change you, Jim.

39:30.191 --> 39:32.792
Your sense of mission... it's
part of what I love about you.

39:32.794 --> 39:35.528
I thought it was
my devastating good looks.

39:35.530 --> 39:36.829
That's a joke.

39:36.831 --> 39:38.898
(laughs)

39:40.834 --> 39:42.368
I was scared.

39:44.138 --> 39:46.272
Scared that Barbara
would get hurt

39:46.274 --> 39:49.041
and you would blame yourself
for protecting me first,

39:49.043 --> 39:51.878
and then
whatever we had would die.

39:51.880 --> 39:55.314
It wasn't heroic.
It was selfish.

39:57.684 --> 40:00.319
(sighs)

40:00.321 --> 40:02.054
Lee, I love you.

40:02.056 --> 40:04.223
Not her.

40:04.225 --> 40:08.327
If I had to do it again,
I'd still protect you first.

40:12.666 --> 40:14.734
(gasps)

40:14.736 --> 40:16.302
What did you do?

40:16.304 --> 40:19.505
Uh, grabbed a...
knife by the blade.

40:19.507 --> 40:21.974
Of course you did.

40:21.976 --> 40:23.342
Let me see.

40:27.581 --> 40:29.582
(groans softly)

40:29.584 --> 40:32.251
Miss Kringle?

40:32.253 --> 40:34.520
Are you okay?

40:36.490 --> 40:38.825
I got a letter
from Officer Dougherty.

40:38.827 --> 40:41.093
He left town.

40:41.095 --> 40:43.296
(clears throat)

40:43.298 --> 40:46.499
"Don't wait around for me.
Go have some fun,

40:46.501 --> 40:48.301
and maybe I'll give you a call
when I get back."

40:48.303 --> 40:49.468
Blah, blah, blah.

40:49.470 --> 40:52.505
Couldn't even tell me
to my face.

40:52.507 --> 40:55.474
I mean, why do I keep
picking creeps?

40:57.044 --> 41:00.079
Sometimes with men, you need
to read between the lines.

41:00.081 --> 41:02.915
Sometimes with men,
you need a drink.

41:02.917 --> 41:04.317
(chuckles)

41:04.319 --> 41:06.385
Good day, Mr. Nygma.

41:11.925 --> 41:13.993
Read between the lines.

Just got wind
of three separate attacks

42:42.317 --> 42:44.417
on Falcone businesses
in different parts of town.

42:44.419 --> 42:46.986
Word is it's Maroni.

As of right now,
all leaves are canceled,

42:50.925 --> 42:53.993
and all units are called
in for active duty.
