-You've grown up.
-I know.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.395
Walking into the house,
it feels like old times.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.896
It feels like a flashback.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.732
Almost like déjà vu,
except times a hundred.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.468
<i>In some ways,</i>

10:35.534 --> 10:37.003
<i>I haven't been there</i>
<i>in a million years</i>

10:37.069 --> 10:38.838
and some ways it feels like
I was there last week.

10:38.904 --> 10:39.972
[Jon]<i> Did you think</i>
<i>we were gonna be back here?</i>

10:40.039 --> 10:41.173
[Tami]
<i>No.</i>

10:42.541 --> 10:45.411
I mean, this is weird to say,
it almost feels like home.

10:46.345 --> 10:47.713
-Man.
-Wow.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.181
These are much bigger beds,
I'm glad 'cause--

10:49.248 --> 10:50.483
We had the twin beds.

10:50.549 --> 10:52.351
Yeah, 'cause I was think
and now I'm wider

10:52.418 --> 10:54.353
-and I need a wider bed.
-[laughs]

10:54.420 --> 10:57.823
I am looking forward
to reconnecting with Jon.

10:57.890 --> 11:01.861

11:01.927 --> 11:05.564
<i>I remember Jon because that's</i>

11:05.631 --> 11:07.633
-Tami. Nice meeting you.
-Nice to meet y'all, Tami.

11:07.700 --> 11:10.770
My mom says, "Hi." She says,
"Will Tami remember me?"

11:10.836 --> 11:12.438
I said, "Mom, she sat down
our couch, she'll remember you."

11:12.505 --> 11:13.739
Yeah, I remember your mom.

11:13.806 --> 11:15.674
I've texted him,
I've talked to him.

11:15.741 --> 11:18.711
We've DM'd each other,
but everybody else,

11:18.778 --> 11:22.481
I have not kept in contact
with these people.

11:23.582 --> 11:25.451
Whoo!

11:25.518 --> 11:29.155
I'm Beth, I'm 52 years old.

11:29.221 --> 11:31.991
And I'm from Los Angeles,
California.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.226

11:48.908 --> 11:50.509

People don't want to talk to me.

to her about?

12:23.342 --> 12:25.411
Like, I ain't had
any conversations with her

12:25.478 --> 12:27.346

12:39.391 --> 12:41.227
Oh, yeah, and that's
what a rapist says, too.

12:41.293 --> 12:42.294
Stop! Rape...?

12:42.361 --> 12:43.629
"You wanted it, baby."

12:43.696 --> 12:45.197
-What the hell are you...
-No means no.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.500
Dominic, Beth,
you ran back there,

12:47.566 --> 12:49.001
pulled the covers off of him,

12:49.068 --> 12:51.637
and called Tami in there,
"Look at his underwear."

12:51.704 --> 12:53.372
Come here,
I want to show you something.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.441
-Uh-uh!
-Go away.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.876
I'm wrong in that sense

12:56.942 --> 12:59.078
then you guys are wrong
in that sense, too.

12:59.145 --> 13:00.813
I guess no meant yes.

13:00.880 --> 13:01.814

13:01.881 --> 13:03.949
-Have fun.
-Thank you.

Beth's in the house.

13:09.388 --> 13:12.625
-Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
-Come on in.

13:12.691 --> 13:15.027
I told myself
I was not gonna cry.

-Hi, Beth.
-Hi, Tami.

You look the same.

-'Cause I'm happy.

-Hi.
-I appreciate that. How are you?

-Can I have a hug?
-Yeah.

13:53.065 --> 13:57.670

Tami is pretty non-existent.

<i>I tried to reach out to her</i>
<i>a few times on social media,</i>

14:00.806 --> 14:03.642
she didn't respond. I don't
think it was important to her

14:03.709 --> 14:06.512
to have a relationship with me.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.314
When you think back on it,

14:08.380 --> 14:09.915
with all of us being back
in the house,

14:09.982 --> 14:12.651
is there anything that
you guys want to discuss?

14:12.718 --> 14:14.420
-[Beth S] Oh, yeah.
-Oh, she said, "Oh, yeah."

14:14.486 --> 14:17.423
Okay, girl,
that's sounding like a list.

14:18.390 --> 14:19.592

reached out to you

14:19.658 --> 14:21.160

on social media--

14:21.227 --> 14:22.695
-You have? Girl, when?
-And you didn't even respond.

14:22.761 --> 14:23.963
Well, let me just say this.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.799
Well, Jon has my number,
so he text me.

14:26.865 --> 14:29.969

there's like 30,000 DM's,

Dominic would say,
"Beth, she is super cool."

Very "Ah, ah."

-You know you're wrong.
-I am not wrong.

19:17.389 --> 19:19.491

I play in a band,
just for the hell of it.

28:53.698 --> 28:55.733
<i>I was living a rock and roll</i>
<i>lifestyle...</i>

28:55.800 --> 28:58.937
<i>♪ I nearly lost you there ♪</i>

28:59.003 --> 29:00.371
<i>...and partying.</i>

29:00.438 --> 29:01.906
I'm not done yet. Stop it!

29:01.973 --> 29:04.442
[laughter]

29:06.044 --> 29:10.482
I was really passionate
about being wild and free.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.188
[laughs]

29:19.591 --> 29:21.793
When I got picked to be
on the show,

29:21.860 --> 29:24.395
I didn't know what happened
to David.

29:24.462 --> 29:26.998
<i>I knew nothing about the person</i>
<i>who I replaced.</i>

29:27.065 --> 29:28.266
<i>I didn't know what happened.</i>

29:28.333 --> 29:29.868
I felt like
I was on the outside.

29:29.934 --> 29:32.570
You guys are characterizing
everybody in that--

29:32.637 --> 29:34.172
Yeah,
because you all look that way

29:34.239 --> 29:36.274
and I don't want to deal with
it, I know to get away.

29:36.341 --> 29:37.275
-Glen.
-Beth.

29:37.342 --> 29:38.643
Nice to meet you.

29:38.710 --> 29:39.911
<i>When Beth A moved</i>
<i>in the house,</i>

29:39.978 --> 29:41.112
I finally felt like
I had somebody

29:41.179 --> 29:42.647
that I could connect with.

29:42.714 --> 29:43.815
So what's all the rules?
What am I not supposed to do?

29:43.882 --> 29:45.350
Rules? [scoffs]

29:45.416 --> 29:46.651
No, let her do, let her go
through what I went through.

29:46.718 --> 29:48.253
-Don't tell her anything.
-[laughs]

29:48.319 --> 29:50.822
Yeah, there's a lot of aspects
to coming in late that,

29:50.889 --> 29:53.091
that impacted
my experience.

29:53.158 --> 29:56.060
Just please, stop talk... just
please stop talking to me, okay,

29:56.127 --> 29:57.095
'cause I've had enough!

29:57.162 --> 29:58.696
<i>We were excluded.</i>

29:58.763 --> 30:00.732
The problem is, nobody talks,
basically, to each other.

30:00.798 --> 30:02.567
Nothing anybody says
in this house is relevant.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.302
We don't find out anything
about each other,

30:04.369 --> 30:05.937
we're all too busy
with ourselves.

30:06.004 --> 30:08.673
[Beth A]<i> No wonder Glen</i>
<i>and I clung to each other</i>

30:08.740 --> 30:10.808
and that created
a life-long bond.

30:12.744 --> 30:17.282
Oh, my gosh, here we are!
Whoop-whoop! This look familiar?

30:18.349 --> 30:20.151
[Beth S]
<i>You want some chips and salsa?</i>

30:20.218 --> 30:22.587
-Yeah.
-Chips and guac?

30:23.855 --> 30:25.256
[Beth A] Do you remember
which house it is?

30:25.323 --> 30:26.457
How would
you not recognize this?

30:26.524 --> 30:28.693
Oh, my gosh, we're here.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.062
-[Irene] Hey, do me a favor?
-[David] Mm.

30:31.129 --> 30:35.066
Go and bring, um,
this lighter up to Jon, please.

30:35.133 --> 30:36.668
Okay, gotcha.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.871
[Glen]
Oh, boy.

30:39.938 --> 30:42.373
[Beth A] Take a deep breath.
Try not to pee your pants.

30:43.708 --> 30:44.909
[gasps]

30:44.976 --> 30:46.711
[Beth A]
Oh, my gosh.

30:47.946 --> 30:49.981
-Wow.
-Hey!

30:50.048 --> 30:52.417
-[Glen] This is awesome.
-[Irene] Ah, it's about time.

30:52.483 --> 30:54.252
-[Glen] Wow.
-Give me hugs.

30:54.319 --> 30:55.720
-Oh, you look so beautiful.
-Wow.

30:55.787 --> 30:58.690
-[laughs]
-Thank you, sweetie.

30:58.756 --> 31:00.458
Beth A, she replaced me

31:00.525 --> 31:02.193
so I never really got
to know her at all.

31:02.260 --> 31:04.929
<i>And, of course, Glen, I really</i>
<i>didn't get very close to either.</i>

31:04.996 --> 31:09.767
He was very subdued,
until after I left.

31:09.834 --> 31:13.071
I'm keeping cool but
you have nothing to say, man.

31:13.137 --> 31:14.739
I'm not done talking yet!

31:14.806 --> 31:17.308
Me and Glen would have clashed,
let's just say, with that.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.544
Look what Beth's cat
just drug in.

31:19.611 --> 31:21.479
-Oh.
-[laughs]

31:21.546 --> 31:23.348
Hey, hey. Oh!

31:23.414 --> 31:25.383
-All right.
-What's up, Beth?

31:25.450 --> 31:27.318
-How's it going?
-Nice to see you.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.020
-Ooh, it's hot.
-Hey, dude.

31:29.087 --> 31:30.888
Hey, a real pleasure. It's so
cool. I'm so glad you're here.

31:30.955 --> 31:32.824
Oh, my gosh, you guys are
meeting for the first time, huh?

31:32.890 --> 31:34.359
-They've never met?
-Yeah.

31:34.425 --> 31:37.629
-You look beautiful.
-Hi.

31:37.695 --> 31:38.997
-Nice to see you.
-Good to meet you.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.932
[Tami] You gonna come here
with a shirt.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.101
You gonna come here
with a shirt.

31:43.167 --> 31:44.702
[laughs]

31:44.769 --> 31:46.571
One thing about Beth,
she gonna have a T-shirt, okay?

31:46.638 --> 31:48.940
First day I met her,
she had on a T-shirt.

31:49.007 --> 31:50.875
What's with the shirt?

31:50.942 --> 31:53.611
Well, I'm gay, but I mean,
it's a joke shirt.

31:53.678 --> 31:55.280
-Oh, you are?
-[Beth A] Yeah.

31:55.346 --> 31:58.116
-Okay.
-I'm a lesbian.

31:58.182 --> 31:59.450
Okay.

31:59.517 --> 32:01.152
You've got a shirt
for every occasion.

32:01.219 --> 32:02.854
My husband made this one for
me. He wanted to be real clear.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.723
-Husband. Husband.
-[laughs]

32:05.790 --> 32:07.158
[Tami]
<i>They look totally different.</i>

32:07.225 --> 32:08.793
<i>I mean, like the same</i>
<i>but different.</i>

32:08.860 --> 32:10.295
You know, that wasn't
what I was expecting.

32:10.361 --> 32:13.264
I really thought Glen
was gonna have a ponytail.

32:13.331 --> 32:16.234
<i>The aging process</i>
<i>is different for everybody.</i>

32:16.301 --> 32:19.937
Black don't crack but white
sometimes got its own type,

32:20.004 --> 32:22.840
you know what I mean?
So... [laughing]

32:22.907 --> 32:25.610
"I'm not straight
but my husband is."

32:25.677 --> 32:27.812
You're married.

32:27.879 --> 32:31.149
I've been married for 18 years,
17 years?

32:31.215 --> 32:32.450
18 years?

32:32.517 --> 32:33.951
Well, I was married before.

32:34.018 --> 32:36.387
I... I was married to my wife
for nine years.

32:36.454 --> 32:41.926
-So now that you are straight--
-And I don't identify that way.

32:41.993 --> 32:44.595
I mean,
I don't identify as gender fluid

32:44.662 --> 32:46.230
or pansexual or any of that.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.099
I hope that this time around,

32:48.166 --> 32:50.935
we go a little bit deeper
than sexual orientation.

32:51.002 --> 32:52.503
-That's my hope.
-No, no, no, we are,

32:52.570 --> 32:54.138
but, I mean, you wore the shirt.

32:54.205 --> 32:56.407
I did. My husband...
my husband made it for me--

32:56.474 --> 32:59.010
If you didn't come here with
the shirt, then we, we would--

32:59.077 --> 33:00.645
So he's like, you got to
represent that you got a man.

33:00.712 --> 33:03.514
So you're not a lesbian anymore?

33:03.581 --> 33:06.117
I think if I self-identified,

33:06.184 --> 33:08.953
I would identify as a lesbian,
for sure.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.788
You would still identify
as a lesbian?

33:10.855 --> 33:14.659
Yeah. It wasn't like I went,
"I'm gonna get me some of that."

33:14.726 --> 33:16.728
Didn't think
I was gonna marry a man.

33:16.794 --> 33:19.897
I love who I love.
That was God's will.

33:23.901 --> 33:25.236
And I was gonna marry this man,

33:25.303 --> 33:27.138
and I was like,
this psychic lady told me.

33:27.205 --> 33:29.040
I was like, "Yeah, you're high,
I would never marry a man."

33:29.107 --> 33:32.877
And I met my husband two days
later and I was like, "Oh, no.

33:32.944 --> 33:35.246
This is what we're gonna do?
Okay."

33:35.313 --> 33:38.282
I'm not like most lesbians.
I was just told, like,

33:38.349 --> 33:41.185
"This is gonna be your husband"
and a year and a half later,

33:41.252 --> 33:43.554
I was married to him
and that took me to Hawaii

33:43.621 --> 33:47.091
<i>where I've been blessed to be</i>
<i>a parent to several children</i>

33:47.158 --> 33:49.927
<i>and to make the difference</i>
<i>in the lives of other people</i>

33:49.994 --> 33:54.031
and my life is blessed,
my life is blessed.

33:54.098 --> 33:55.800
So you can marry a man
and still be a lesbian--

33:55.867 --> 33:58.102
I've learned, if God
speaks to you, you, you follow.

33:58.169 --> 34:00.371
So when I was told,
"You're gonna marry this man",

34:00.438 --> 34:02.540
I just went,
"Okay, show me the way."

34:02.607 --> 34:04.442
I receive that.

34:04.509 --> 34:08.146
<i>She says she heard the Word of</i>
<i>God and I have to respect that.</i>

34:08.212 --> 34:12.583
When you bring God into it
and really hearing him speak,

34:12.650 --> 34:15.486
and that's why she chose
to have a husband,

34:15.553 --> 34:16.754
I'm accepting of that.

34:16.821 --> 34:18.189
[Glen]
Where was your husband from?

34:18.256 --> 34:19.757
He's from Houston.

34:19.824 --> 34:21.225
-Oh, well, that's why, okay.
-[Tami] Yeah, I met him--

34:21.292 --> 34:22.960
And you have extended fam,
he has his family there?

34:23.027 --> 34:25.563
Yes. So they did rolling power--

34:25.630 --> 34:27.131
-You got, you got--
-Oh!

34:27.198 --> 34:28.766
It likes your dress.

34:28.833 --> 34:30.802
'Cause I'll take this wig off
and smack the shit out of it.

34:30.868 --> 34:31.803
[laughs]

34:31.869 --> 34:34.872
-Oh! Oh! Oh!
-[screams]

34:34.939 --> 34:35.940
You guys, it's just--

34:36.007 --> 34:37.675
-It's a drone.
-[laughs]

34:37.742 --> 34:39.710
-It's just a beetle.
-It's a big green bug.

34:39.777 --> 34:41.279
-Okay, there he goes.
-There it goes, okay.

34:41.345 --> 34:43.014
-There he goes, there he goes.
-Whoa! Okay.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.549
Those steaks
are looking good, playa.

34:44.615 --> 34:47.752
-Yeah, good.
-[laughs]

34:47.819 --> 34:50.688
[Beth S] Glen, do you talk
to Aaron or Dominic?

34:50.755 --> 34:52.156
[Glen] I'm not in touch
with them a lot.

34:52.223 --> 34:53.124
[Irene]
Yeah.

34:53.191 --> 34:54.625
But when certain things come up,

34:54.692 --> 34:55.927
I reach out to him
and he's always available.

34:55.993 --> 34:57.762
It's nice to be able
to reach out.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.397
I reach out to you or,
you know.

34:59.464 --> 35:00.665
Right, yeah.

35:00.731 --> 35:02.033
We're not friends
on Facebook so...

35:02.099 --> 35:03.367
-No, we are not.
-[Glen] Maybe we'll change that.

35:03.434 --> 35:06.137
-Why is that, Glen?
-[laughs]

35:06.204 --> 35:07.638
Why aren't we friends?

35:07.705 --> 35:09.674
But you never friend requested
me either on Facebook,

35:09.740 --> 35:12.643
so, right, it goes both ways.

35:14.011 --> 35:20.218
I have no idea
why Glen disliked me so much.

35:20.284 --> 35:22.653
I've tried with Beth
and I'm beginning to hate her.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.056
Her freaky friend
brought a dog over.

35:25.122 --> 35:26.257
Calm down.

35:26.324 --> 35:28.326
I'm glad you guys
don't have any problems.

35:28.392 --> 35:30.361
Can't we all just get along?

35:30.428 --> 35:32.129
Just because Glen has no life
and he has nothing better to do

35:32.196 --> 35:34.799
than to give me shit,
that's why.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.634
I have a great life, bitch.

35:36.701 --> 35:38.369
-[Beth S] Glen, shut up.
-[Glen] No.

35:38.436 --> 35:43.241
We've never shared any deep
conversations about anything.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.209
-Oh, you're beyond.
-Yeah, I want to get beyond.

35:45.276 --> 35:47.078
Oh, yeah, you like, like you
know what that means, Beth.

35:47.144 --> 35:48.813
[Dominic] All right, enough.
Hey, guys, guys.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.948
I thought a lot about
my relationship with Beth S

35:51.015 --> 35:53.417
over the years and
why there might be tension.

35:53.484 --> 35:56.521
Beth, you're an idiot actor.
You're so pathetic, man.

35:56.587 --> 35:59.190
It's either that or you're
an idiot. You make me sick.

35:59.257 --> 36:00.591
Slow down. Slow down.

36:00.658 --> 36:02.293
We just don't get along,
you know?

36:02.360 --> 36:03.728
It's just the people we are.

36:03.794 --> 36:06.230
I'm not the one that
had a problem with you.

36:06.297 --> 36:07.865
-You didn't?
-No.

36:07.932 --> 36:10.968
I'm Glen, I'm on<i> The Real World,</i>
man. Here's my number.

36:11.035 --> 36:12.403
[laughs]

36:12.470 --> 36:13.971
Well, that's what he did
when he first came out here.

36:14.038 --> 36:16.073
-Handed out his phone number
to strangers. -Yeah.

36:16.140 --> 36:18.476
Be my friend,
I'm on<i> The Real World.</i>

36:18.543 --> 36:19.510
[laughs]
Be my friend.

36:19.577 --> 36:21.479
You know, what the hell is that?

36:21.546 --> 36:23.047
[laughs]

36:23.114 --> 36:26.951
That's just... that's so lame.
That is just so lame.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.886
You had a problem with me
and I...

36:28.953 --> 36:30.521
But, you know,
it's interesting--

36:30.588 --> 36:32.657
Still to this day, you know,
I think, I stay up at night

36:32.723 --> 36:35.593
and I think,
"Gosh, I, you know,

36:35.660 --> 36:38.195
I wonder why Glen
didn't like me."

36:38.262 --> 36:39.564
Hmm.

36:39.630 --> 36:42.233
I'm being sar...
I'm being sarcastic.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.235
I'm being sarcastic.

36:44.302 --> 36:46.070
[Irene]<i> Beth S</i>
<i>always had this thing</i>

36:46.137 --> 36:48.539
<i>where she needs</i>
<i>to have acceptance from people.</i>

36:48.606 --> 36:52.777
And I'm like, "Why?
Why do you need that so bad?"

36:54.445 --> 36:57.348
[female voice]
<i>Incoming message.</i>

36:57.415 --> 37:00.251
Uh-oh. Incoming message.

37:00.318 --> 37:02.019
[Beth A]
<i>We're casually hanging out</i>

37:02.086 --> 37:05.089
and this incoming message
comes on the screen.

37:05.156 --> 37:07.525
We're gonna talk through
this stuff, you know,

37:07.592 --> 37:09.160
and so that's a little uneasy.

37:09.226 --> 37:11.295
Do we need more distance
between...

37:11.362 --> 37:13.030

37:36.587 --> 37:37.955

she didn't have any clothes on.

39:02.139 --> 39:03.607
I hate seeing that every time.

39:03.674 --> 39:07.344
Every time,
gets me a sick feeling.

39:08.312 --> 39:10.614
Because of what I didn't do.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.283
[Jon]
I try not to watch that.

39:12.349 --> 39:13.718
I think, I mean,
it's embarrassing

39:13.784 --> 39:15.786
that I was part of it all.

39:16.587 --> 39:18.689
It's embarrassing.

39:20.024 --> 39:22.493
You know, I watched
this over a million times

39:22.560 --> 39:26.630
and, I mean,
watching it again,

39:26.697 --> 39:28.666
everybody's having
such a good fuckin' time,

39:28.733 --> 39:32.403
everybody's laughing,
pounding on the floor,

39:32.470 --> 39:34.438
even you're laughing
in the interview.

39:34.505 --> 39:36.941
You're laughing,
you're pulling the blanket,

39:37.007 --> 39:41.345
you give the wrestling count and
"One, two, three, a-hey!"

39:41.412 --> 39:42.980
And every,
you know, every...

39:43.047 --> 39:46.217
That's... I'm... I'm coming
from a playful perspective.

39:46.283 --> 39:48.953
You pull... Y'all was in there
first before I got in there.

39:50.354 --> 39:53.657
<i>We were all just playing around,</i>
<i>trying to have a good time</i>

39:53.724 --> 39:57.428
and when it blew up on me
like that, I was like "What?"

39:57.495 --> 40:01.565
I felt like a bank robber after
you, you know, you get the pouch

40:01.632 --> 40:03.534
and you go somewhere
and just open it

40:03.601 --> 40:05.870
and dye, orange dye
ends up all over you.

40:05.936 --> 40:10.708
For me, when I watch that,
I still get angry,

40:10.775 --> 40:13.210
because if I say that
I don't go no clothes on,

40:13.277 --> 40:16.847
then nobody should have
tried to pull the covers off.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.983
People don't understand
that laughter

40:19.049 --> 40:22.653
is sometimes to cover
uncomfortableness

40:22.720 --> 40:27.258
and awkwardness and
they don't know what to do

40:27.324 --> 40:30.895
and that's kind of what was
happening in that moment for me.

40:30.961 --> 40:35.199
Without you guys knowing
who I am,

40:35.266 --> 40:37.368
what I was dealing with,

40:37.434 --> 40:39.770
even while we were shooting
this show,

40:39.837 --> 40:43.140
then you can't understand
the magnitude of why I was like,

40:43.207 --> 40:45.109
"Don't pull these damn covers
off of me."

40:46.710 --> 40:48.212
<i>The first time in the house,</i>

40:48.279 --> 40:50.815
<i>I was very guarded</i>
<i>with my roommates.</i>

40:50.881 --> 40:54.185
I need to tell them
what's happening in this moment.

40:54.251 --> 40:55.686
In my personal life,

40:55.753 --> 41:00.057
y'all did not see me
popping laxatives,

41:00.124 --> 41:04.028
y'all did not hear me
throwing up, okay?

41:04.094 --> 41:08.632
Y'all did not know that
I was battling body dysmorphia.

41:09.967 --> 41:13.971
Nobody understood
why I got my mouth wired,

41:14.038 --> 41:18.409
was because I'm a person who,
no matter when I look at myself,

41:18.475 --> 41:20.878
I feel like I'm 300 pounds.

41:20.945 --> 41:22.813
<i>At this particular point</i>
<i>in my life,</i>

41:22.880 --> 41:25.182
I am not happy
with my, my, my body.

41:25.249 --> 41:26.450
I'm not happy with myself.

41:26.517 --> 41:28.919
<i>I'm getting my mouth wired.</i>

41:28.986 --> 41:31.055
<i>Everyone thinks</i>
<i>I'm crazy to do this.</i>

41:31.121 --> 41:33.891
If you could eat anything
right now, what would you have?

41:33.958 --> 41:36.126
A chicken taco
from across the street.

41:36.193 --> 41:39.897
Tami, what's wrong with being,
you know, the weight you are?

41:40.698 --> 41:43.400
Me getting my mouth wired
in 1993,

41:43.467 --> 41:46.837
I don't think anybody
had ever heard of the process.

41:46.904 --> 41:48.505
People seem to think
I'm thin

41:48.572 --> 41:51.809
and, "Oh, you don't need to wire
your mouth and you can do this

41:51.876 --> 41:53.410
and you can eat anything
and you don't gain weight"

41:53.477 --> 41:55.479
and, blah, blah, blah, and
all that other whoop-de-doo shit

41:55.546 --> 41:56.614
that I don't even care about.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.349
But when I take off my clothes,

41:58.415 --> 42:02.253
I'm not happy with what I see
and I feel that I eat too much.

42:02.319 --> 42:04.255
<i>I hate that people saw that</i>

42:04.321 --> 42:07.224
<i>because that</i>
<i>is not a healthy thing to do.</i>

42:07.291 --> 42:12.730
I could not see the beauty
in myself at that time in '93.

42:12.796 --> 42:15.366
When you pull the covers off
of somebody who's like,

42:15.432 --> 42:17.134
"Oh, my God,

42:17.201 --> 42:20.170
everybody's gonna see
how fat I am."

42:20.237 --> 42:23.307
I was humiliated,
I felt disrespected,

42:23.374 --> 42:29.179
I was vulnerable in a way that
I didn't want to be,

42:29.246 --> 42:31.248
and I was uncomfortable.

42:31.315 --> 42:36.086
I'm willing now to give you
a pass on that.

42:37.288 --> 42:41.191
Tami, if I'd know that you had
any kind of those problems,

42:41.258 --> 42:45.362
I would have never done that.
I had no idea,

42:45.429 --> 42:47.865
mentally in your head,
what you was going through.

42:47.932 --> 42:50.701
Um, I appreciate
your willingness

42:50.768 --> 42:52.503
and I appreciate you
giving me a pass,

42:52.569 --> 42:54.238
but I don't want it
and this is why.

42:54.972 --> 42:58.909
Everybody's laughing,
including you.

42:58.976 --> 43:00.911
I was laughing
because it was uncomfortable

43:00.978 --> 43:02.513
and I didn't know what to do.

43:02.579 --> 43:05.950
After you say, "Stop,"
after you say, "Don't do that."

43:06.016 --> 43:08.152
I wasn't the only one
pulling that blanket.

43:08.218 --> 43:10.220
Yes, I'm the last one that
got the blanket off.

43:10.287 --> 43:13.090
Everybody's in the hallway,
screaming, yelling, laughing.

43:13.157 --> 43:16.593
Everybody, including you,
including me,

43:16.660 --> 43:18.228
Jon does the three sec--

43:18.295 --> 43:19.830
If you say that out your mouth
one more time I feel like,

43:19.897 --> 43:21.465
I feel like you disrespected me
yet again.

43:21.532 --> 43:23.000
Three second, the three, I'm not
trying to disrespect you--

43:23.067 --> 43:24.301
Because you keep saying the
same thing

43:24.368 --> 43:25.703
and I already explained to you.

43:25.769 --> 43:27.204
I'm saying what's on the video.

43:27.271 --> 43:28.939
[Tami] That was uncomfortable,
awkward laughter--

43:29.006 --> 43:30.174
Can we play this a se...
Can we play it again, please?

43:30.240 --> 43:31.742
I don't want to see that
shit again.

43:31.809 --> 43:33.210
No, we need to watch it again.

43:33.277 --> 43:34.478
I've been living with that shit
for 27 years.

43:34.545 --> 43:35.879
Okay, I need to see it again,

43:35.946 --> 43:36.880

the face and say, "Shut up."

44:01.772 --> 44:04.808

to heal

44:16.153 --> 44:18.088
from being a fucking bulimic.

44:18.155 --> 44:19.656
I probably wouldn't even
have signed up for the show

had these kind of issues

44:21.558 --> 44:23.160
