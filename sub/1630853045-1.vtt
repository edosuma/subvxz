00:54.305 --> 00:57.933
friends or... or family members
who are struggling.

00:59.769 --> 01:03.105
That means a lot of people,
even in our church,

01:04.482 --> 01:06.776
feel really alone.

01:06.859 --> 01:09.737
So let’s show them our love

01:09.820 --> 01:14.992
and send these boys off
in the embrace of God’s love.

01:15.075 --> 01:18.913
Joe Lee, Michael Randolph
and Benjamin Ellis.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.414
-[pastor] Come on.
-[churchgoers cheering]

01:20.498 --> 01:21.665
Yeah. That’s right.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.668
Gentlemen, please
join me up here on stage.

01:26.879 --> 01:29.924
[thunder rumbling]

01:30.007 --> 01:32.301
[scrubbing]

01:37.473 --> 01:38.599
[blows]

02:19.306 --> 02:21.600
[James panting]

02:28.524 --> 02:30.985
[pastor] We pray, dear Lord,

02:31.068 --> 02:32.820
for those that wield
the swords so that...

02:33.946 --> 02:35.906
that righteousness
may triumph

02:35.990 --> 02:38.492
and wrongdoings
may be vanquished.

02:38.576 --> 02:41.829
For these men
are our protectors.

02:42.788 --> 02:45.291
Lord, please
comfort their families

02:45.374 --> 02:47.418
while these men
are deployed.

02:47.501 --> 02:52.131
Bestow special grace
upon all these children.

02:53.966 --> 02:57.303
[fading] May God bless you
and protect you.

02:57.386 --> 03:01.307
And may God bless America.
Amen.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.474
[churchgoers] Amen.

03:29.627 --> 03:33.339
[panting, sighs]

03:45.643 --> 03:46.977
[sighs]

03:57.613 --> 03:58.697
[groans]

04:05.704 --> 04:09.458
[person singing in Farsi
on earphones]

04:20.511 --> 04:22.262
[singing continues]

04:22.346 --> 04:23.472
[James sighs]

04:44.910 --> 04:46.453
[dogs barking]

05:29.079 --> 05:30.080
[sighs]

05:31.248 --> 05:33.000
[James] Sorry.
I didn’t want to wake you up.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.626
That’s all right.
I was already awake.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.339
[Brianne] How’s training going?

05:43.010 --> 05:45.554
[kisses] Do we have time
for night sex or no?

05:45.637 --> 05:47.222
[whispering]
I think he’s awake.

05:47.306 --> 05:49.141
Doesn’t he have school today?

05:49.224 --> 05:50.350
No, it’s Saturday.

05:50.434 --> 05:52.978
[chuckles] Aren’t they
in school on Saturdays?

05:53.062 --> 05:54.813
Not since 1953.

05:54.897 --> 05:57.691
I liked 1953 a lot.
It’s a great year.
[laughs]

05:58.692 --> 06:00.402
[Brianne]
Want to say hi to Dad?

06:03.614 --> 06:04.907
Hi.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.492
Hey, Dad.
What you got there?

06:08.869 --> 06:09.995
Oh, look at that.

06:10.079 --> 06:11.872
[Jack]
That’s you in the airplane.
Mm-hmm.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.290
[Jack]
And those are the clouds.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.834
He’s been working on that
all week for you.

06:17.461 --> 06:18.712
That’s incredible.

06:25.135 --> 06:28.680
Give us a hand. Okay.
Come on. [grunts]

06:40.150 --> 06:43.445
Jack? Jack?
I’m right behind you,
Dad.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.864
Jack? Jack?
Dad, I’m right here.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.909
Come on. You got this.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.410
I believe in you.

06:50.494 --> 06:52.162
I’m gonna be right here,
okay?

06:52.246 --> 06:55.040
If you need anything,
I’m gonna be right here.

06:55.124 --> 06:56.583
[grunts]

07:00.462 --> 07:01.839
[pants]

07:08.303 --> 07:09.930
All right. You ready?

07:10.013 --> 07:11.640
No.
Yeah, you are.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.100
No. Please don’t leave me.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.768
[James] I’m not leaving you.
I’m right here.

07:14.852 --> 07:17.187
Jack, look at me.

07:17.271 --> 07:20.607
Three... two... one.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.152
Now, let go, son.
Swim to me.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.903
No.
You’ve got this.

07:26.155 --> 07:27.698
That’s it. Let go.
Eyes on me.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.449
Use your feet.

07:29.533 --> 07:31.201
That’s it!
You’re swimming, Jack.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.828
You’re swimming. Come on!

07:34.079 --> 07:36.582
You’re doing it, Jack.
You’re swimming. Come on!

07:38.041 --> 07:39.251
You did good, son.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.420
Mom! I did it!

07:41.503 --> 07:42.880
[Brianne] Yeah, you did.
I did it!

07:42.963 --> 07:45.757
Dad, I think I can swim now.
Look.

07:51.930 --> 07:52.973
Again!

07:57.895 --> 07:59.271
Look at that.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.939
[Jack]
An inch in seven months.

08:01.023 --> 08:03.775
[James]
An inch in seven months.
How about that?

08:03.859 --> 08:06.445
Is that enough?
That’s a lot. That’s perfect.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.488
[Jack sighs]

08:08.572 --> 08:09.573
[James sighs]

08:13.285 --> 08:14.953
[phone chimes]

08:17.789 --> 08:20.042
Hi, this is Sheila
from Bills Recovery.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.544
I just wanna check in with y’all
on your past due paym...

08:22.628 --> 08:25.130
[automated voice]
Message deleted.

08:25.214 --> 08:28.050
[soldier]
Hey, James. Listen, man,
I’m sorry to ruin your weekend,

08:28.133 --> 08:30.302
but the CO is testing
the whole team.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.261
Uh, you better get down here.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.602
[soldiers chattering]

08:45.275 --> 08:47.653
[PA announcer]
Army Sergeant First Class
James Harper.

08:49.780 --> 08:50.906
[sighs]

09:05.128 --> 09:07.089
At ease, Sergeant.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.508
This is our new CO,
Lieutenant Colonel Roberts.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.471
Knee was shredded. Again.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.600
Great job with the rehab.
Thank you, sir.

09:18.684 --> 09:21.353
Your lung precludes
high altitude
or underwater operations.

09:23.146 --> 09:27.401
I’ve done four combat
rotations in five years
with that lung, sir.

09:29.027 --> 09:30.654
You can relax,
Sergeant Harper.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.827
Blood work came back
filthy with Stanozolol,

09:36.910 --> 09:39.955
Nandrolone,
phenylpropionate and HGH.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.750
[Roberts]
You’re an SOF medical sergeant.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.585
Should have known better.

09:45.669 --> 09:48.588
I wanted
to stay on the team, sir.
I wanted to stay on the team.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.757
[Roberts] I have no idea
what your previous COs
encouraged,

09:50.841 --> 09:53.468
but I won’t accept that
in my unit.

09:53.552 --> 09:56.346
Big Army recommended
a revocation
of your Special Forces tab.

09:56.430 --> 10:00.642
And although
I disagree with your choices,
I’m not going to do that.

10:00.726 --> 10:02.853
You’re leaving the army
with an honorable discharge,

10:02.936 --> 10:05.981
but you’re losing your benefits,
which include your pension
and health care.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.358
Dismissed.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.331
James.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.418
- You don’t have to
say anything.
- Look. They’re cleaning house.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.837
- You made it easy for them.
- I’ll own up. I understand.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.298
With your rep,

10:31.381 --> 10:34.217
every private’s gonna be
hitting on you the second
you walk off post.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.140
[horn playing]

10:57.699 --> 11:01.995
[James] I took shit for my knee.
They found it in my blood.
That’s what it was.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.122
So that’s it?
And there’s nothing
you can do?

11:04.206 --> 11:05.457
Mm-mmm.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.293
So, they just
basically made up
a new bullshit rule...

11:08.377 --> 11:09.544
- They didn’t make up a...
- Test...

11:09.628 --> 11:11.046
No, they didn’t make up
any bullshit.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.714
You said they haven’t
tested anybody in years.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.966
They haven’t tested
anyone in years.
But it’s legal.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.261
It’s the new CO that
has a fucking hard-on
for just...

11:18.345 --> 11:20.389
I don’t know,
he just wants to clear house.

11:20.472 --> 11:23.016
That’s what the captain told me.
They wanna clear house.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.271
What’s this?

11:28.355 --> 11:31.191
It’s, um, debt collectors.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.526
But I already
talked to them.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.695
And, uh, they said
they could help us
with a plan.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.408
What’s the interest rate
on it?

11:39.491 --> 11:40.867
It’s 18%.

11:43.412 --> 11:46.665
Yeah. There is...
There’s real work out there
with real money.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.501
Private contracting?
Yeah.

11:51.294 --> 11:52.337
Mm-mmm.
Why not?

11:52.421 --> 11:53.964
No. You said you weren’t
gonna do that...

11:54.047 --> 11:56.258
I know what I said.
I know what I said.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.012
No.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.515
Mm-mmm. [sighs]

12:08.770 --> 12:10.439
[sighs]

12:12.232 --> 12:13.275
I love you.

12:13.358 --> 12:14.484
[Bruce]
This is Bruce Michaels

12:14.568 --> 12:15.986
with Executive Protection.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.363
Congrats on your years
of decorated service.

12:18.447 --> 12:20.115
We’d love to discuss
opportunities.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.160
[David]
Mr. Harper, my name is David.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.078
I’m calling from
the Department of Water
and Power.

Message deleted.

12:26.788 --> 12:27.789
[phone chimes]

12:41.845 --> 12:43.472
What are you doing?

12:43.555 --> 12:45.974
Just putting up
some shingles before...

12:46.057 --> 12:48.477
[pants]
before we get weather.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.561
Where’s our son?

12:49.644 --> 12:52.022
Oh, he’s asleep.
He’s down for the count.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.107
Took him a bit, but...

12:54.191 --> 12:56.359
How was, uh...
How was school?

12:56.443 --> 12:58.612
- Can you come down?
- Yeah, I’ll come down
in a second.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.363
I just have
a couple more to do.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.574
Honey, I got something
to tell you.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.951
- I’ll be down in a minute.
- No. Like, now.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.786
I’ll be down in a minute,
Brianne.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.121
Mason’s gone.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.501
What?

13:12.584 --> 13:14.252
Mason. He’s gone.

13:14.336 --> 13:17.714
I... I just talked to Suzanne.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.176
[sighs] How?

13:22.969 --> 13:24.262
How do you think?

13:27.390 --> 13:30.685
- When’s the funeral?
- It’s tomorrow.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.355
Maybe we should call your mom
and see if she can take Jack.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.190
I’m not gonna go.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.775
Of course
we’re gonna go, Brianne.

13:36.858 --> 13:40.362
No, I’m not gonna go.
’Cause I can’t go
to another one.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.292
What are you doing?

13:56.044 --> 13:58.880
-What?
-What are you doing on the roof
in the middle of the night?

14:00.840 --> 14:02.259
I’m fixing the roof.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.393
I’m okay.

14:12.769 --> 14:13.979
I’m just...

14:15.397 --> 14:17.857
That’s exactly
what Mason said to Suzanne.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.735
I’m really fucking scared.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.906
I’m not my father.

14:28.785 --> 14:32.122
[announcer on TV, faint]

15:33.516 --> 15:35.185
He would’ve hated this.

15:36.978 --> 15:38.730
The ceremony or dying?

15:38.813 --> 15:40.440
Just being fat and ugly.

15:42.567 --> 15:46.029
How do you figure
they shoved his giant butt
into that grave?

15:46.112 --> 15:47.113
He’s wearing a thong.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.701
[both laugh]

15:57.040 --> 15:58.333
[James clears throat]

15:58.416 --> 15:59.918
[sniffs]

16:00.001 --> 16:01.461
How’d he do it?

16:01.544 --> 16:03.129
What do you mean?

16:04.673 --> 16:06.424
He died in his sleep.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.386
The family get full payout?

16:09.469 --> 16:10.470
Full payout.

16:11.221 --> 16:12.389
That’s good.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.559
- Why don’t you come over
for dinner?
- No.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.353
You haven’t seen
the new house.

16:18.436 --> 16:21.981
You’re coming to dinner.
You’re as moody as he was fat.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.608
-Fuck you.
-[Mike] Fuck you.

16:30.782 --> 16:31.908
[chattering]

16:31.991 --> 16:33.034
Yeah.

16:33.118 --> 16:35.203
Good to see you.
Glad you’re here.

16:35.286 --> 16:38.164
Appreciate it.
You have a beautiful home.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.209
Hey, bud.
How’s it going?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.586
You wanna play a video game?

16:43.670 --> 16:47.382
When do I...
When do I not wanna play
a video game? Look at this.

16:47.465 --> 16:48.925
- Hey.
- The White Sox.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.135
- Yeah.
- Nice.

16:50.218 --> 16:53.054
- I love the White Sox.
- [chuckles] Yeah. Apparently.

16:53.138 --> 16:55.682
- What? I like the White Sox.
- Hey, Kelly.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.016
Hi, Uncle James.

16:58.268 --> 16:59.894
[Mike Jr.] You got that?

16:59.978 --> 17:02.522
You gonna give me a tour,
or should I just get a map?

17:02.605 --> 17:04.941
[laughs]
I guess so.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.358
Watch this. [pants]

17:06.443 --> 17:08.319
Yeah? Well, watch this.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.449
- [James] Really good arm.
- Roger Clemens over here.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.492
[laughs]

17:16.953 --> 17:18.371
[Mike]
Thank you for this meal

17:18.454 --> 17:22.000
and thank you for bringing
Uncle James back safely.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.085
Amen.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.503
Amen.
[Christine] Amen.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.760
[Mike Jr.]
Who was a better soldier,
you or my dad?

17:31.843 --> 17:35.221
Well, uh, your dad
was my chief, so...

17:35.305 --> 17:36.473
[Mike] Careful.
[chuckles]

17:36.556 --> 17:37.724
[Christine chuckles]

17:37.807 --> 17:39.434
I was his superior.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.895
[Mike Jr.] Oh.
But we were, uh...

17:41.978 --> 17:45.607
How would you say?
We looked after each other.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.942
[Mike Jr.]
Oh, kinda like brothers.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.862
[Mike] Yeah,
kinda like brothers. Uh...

17:50.945 --> 17:53.156
Is it true you actually
saved my dad’s life?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.701
No. Yes.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.995
[all laugh]

17:59.078 --> 18:01.706
Once. He pulled me
out of a bar once.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.041
[James] Yeah, he was a wreck.

18:03.124 --> 18:04.751
Your father
was an absolute wreck.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.920
I hate to break it to you
this early. [laughing]

18:07.003 --> 18:09.464
-[Mike laughs] I... No.
-[Mike Jr.] Bummer.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.757
[all chuckling]

18:10.840 --> 18:14.552
Well, uh, Mikey loves baseball.
He’ll never play.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.679
He’s fighting it. He’s...

18:18.348 --> 18:19.599
No quit in his DNA.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.351
There’s no beating it.

18:23.353 --> 18:27.023
Well, best case,
he’ll need special care
for the rest of his life.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.072
How are you doing?

18:34.155 --> 18:36.491
Good. Yeah, good.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.243
Yeah.
You?

18:38.326 --> 18:41.079
Yeah, good. I mean, sure.

18:43.248 --> 18:45.959
You don’t fall off the grid
for two months if you’re good.
What’s up?

18:46.042 --> 18:47.126
[sighs]

18:49.838 --> 18:51.381
What do you look forward to?

18:56.761 --> 18:58.513
Watching my kids grow up.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.266
Seeing ’em smile.

19:03.893 --> 19:07.021
Making sure they’re set.
Giving them the things
I didn’t have.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.278
I gotta get my shit straight.

19:20.869 --> 19:21.870
There’s help.

19:23.580 --> 19:27.834
[sighs] No.
Kill any operational future?
No, not a chance.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.589
[sighs]
Privates contacted me.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.715
Good.
Yeah.

19:33.798 --> 19:36.426
Yeah. No, fuck yeah.
You deserve a paycheck.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.262
Bank is on my ass,
and I just...
Hell yeah. Take it.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.472
I pulled a couple
of cowboy tours.

19:41.556 --> 19:45.351
You know,
banked some decent cash,
put a down payment on the house.

19:45.435 --> 19:49.230
Cash is real.
You know, five, six a day.

19:51.316 --> 19:53.693
Bonuses, you know,
it adds up.

19:53.776 --> 19:56.070
It’s okay to cash in.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.781
You know,
it’s pure fuckin’ Darwin
out here.

20:00.116 --> 20:03.745
And we are trained
to be ruthlessly adaptable.
Use it.

20:05.914 --> 20:07.999
We’re all just mercenaries
in the end.

20:11.461 --> 20:15.506
[sighs] So what
do you got going now?
Is it JSOC? Agency?

20:15.590 --> 20:16.966
Uh, in between.

20:17.050 --> 20:20.845
It doesn’t pay
as good as private,
but it’s legit NatSec work.

20:20.929 --> 20:23.598
He’s one of us.
Good people. Rock-solid.

20:23.681 --> 20:25.016
How much?

20:25.099 --> 20:26.768
Oh, 350.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.610
Can you get me in?

20:35.693 --> 20:38.279
Fucking hero?
President shook your hand.

20:38.363 --> 20:40.156
Fuck off.
He shakes a lot of hands.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.408
They pulled my clearances
because of blood work.

20:42.492 --> 20:45.411
At this level, as long
as you’re good to go,

20:45.495 --> 20:48.081
Rusty doesn’t care
what you put in your body.

20:50.792 --> 20:51.793
I’m in.

20:51.876 --> 20:54.253
- Is that what you want?
- That’s what I want.

20:54.337 --> 20:56.631
I’m broke, Mike.
I need this.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.468
I’ll send your name up.

21:02.512 --> 21:03.513
Yeah.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.181
All right.
I’ll set up a meet.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.308
Yeah. Thanks.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.019
Of course.

21:49.684 --> 21:52.353
[song continues]

21:52.437 --> 21:54.397
[dog barking]

21:55.440 --> 21:56.941
[song stops]

22:01.863 --> 22:03.239
- What’s up, fellas?
- Hey, man.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.450
This is James,
old running mate of mine.
Where is he?

22:05.533 --> 22:08.870
You know where he’s at.
Why don’t you give us a hand
every once in a while?

22:16.502 --> 22:19.922
[Mike] Yo, Chief.
Got anything tasty for me?

22:27.388 --> 22:28.473
Like fucking candy.

22:28.556 --> 22:29.974
Hmm, Cherokee Purple.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.311
It’s an honor to meet you.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.021
Thank you, sir.

22:35.104 --> 22:38.816
You can cut the "sir" crap.
My name is Rusty,
Rusty Jennings.

22:38.900 --> 22:39.901
Thanks, Mike.

22:39.984 --> 22:41.736
Hey, you mind grabbing my boots?

22:43.905 --> 22:44.906
Hey, Dave.

22:45.615 --> 22:47.325
You want a beer?

22:47.408 --> 22:48.534
I’m good, thank you.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.372
Thank you.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.170
Mike’s the best
I ever worked with.

23:01.214 --> 23:03.466
He says you’re the best
he’s ever worked with.

23:06.928 --> 23:11.599
Yeah. Well,
he, uh... He taught me
everything I know.

23:11.682 --> 23:16.104
[inhales] Our reputation
is the only commodity
we got left in this game.

23:20.650 --> 23:21.651
You reading my story?

23:23.194 --> 23:25.321
Yours, mine, Mike’s, Mason’s.

23:25.404 --> 23:28.407
It’s all the same fucking story.
Shit, even your father’s.

23:28.491 --> 23:30.785
My father has nothing
to do with this.

23:31.869 --> 23:32.954
Due respect.

23:34.038 --> 23:37.500
And due respect...
sure he does.

23:40.962 --> 23:45.842
[sighs] We gave them our minds,
our bodies and our spirit.

23:49.387 --> 23:51.514
And they chewed us up
and spit us out.

23:52.515 --> 23:56.060
Left us with fear,
rage, uncertainty,

23:56.144 --> 24:00.189
disillusionment,
a sense of abandonment,
betrayal.

24:00.273 --> 24:03.109
And finally,
self-loathing and guilt.

24:03.192 --> 24:08.322
As if somehow,
everything that happened to us
was our own goddamn fault.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.829
I know exactly
where you are right now, son.

24:17.582 --> 24:18.833
I was you.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.794
Hell, we all were.

24:21.878 --> 24:24.046
That’s why we started
our own tribe.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.679
I know you got options
in front of you.

24:34.223 --> 24:35.975
And if you’re looking
for a big payday,

24:36.058 --> 24:38.019
the top tiers
can give it to you.

24:38.102 --> 24:42.565
Triple Canopy, Aegis
and that soulless fuck-pig,
Erik Prince.

24:43.608 --> 24:45.109
But I need you to hear me

24:46.569 --> 24:48.571
’cause I mean this.

24:48.654 --> 24:51.616
The stink from those gigs,
it will rub off on you.

24:56.329 --> 24:58.080
So what is it that you do?

24:58.164 --> 25:01.167
You offer up
something different or what?

25:01.250 --> 25:02.251
Damn straight.

25:04.086 --> 25:06.589
I can give you a real home,
honorable work.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.842
No corporate interest,
no babysitting billionaires,
no bullshit.

25:09.926 --> 25:13.346
We operate with direct
presidential authority
under Title 50.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.723
Deal strictly with matters
of national security.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.600
A deep black OGA offshoot.

25:18.976 --> 25:20.645
Title 50. I know those guys.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.855
We worked together
downrange.

25:23.481 --> 25:24.649
[chuckles]

25:24.732 --> 25:26.317
We import and export coffee.

25:29.195 --> 25:32.740
Man, what you did in uniform,
sledgehammer shit.

25:32.823 --> 25:35.826
Our thing, scalpel work.

25:35.910 --> 25:38.996
High-speed, low drag,
fangs only come out
when they have to.

25:40.081 --> 25:41.540
[sighs]

25:41.624 --> 25:44.669
There’s a situation
in Berlin that threatens
our national security.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.964
The team led by Mike
will be fully black

25:48.047 --> 25:50.091
since our presence
is not approved.

25:50.174 --> 25:51.175
How long?

25:51.926 --> 25:53.427
Two weeks. Three, tops.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.265
So what do you say?
You down for the cause?

25:59.767 --> 26:01.602
Yeah. For sure.

26:01.686 --> 26:04.397
Excellent.
Mike and Dalton will walk you
through the paperwork.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.399
In the meantime,
Brianne and Jack obviously...

26:06.482 --> 26:08.609
Uh, what do they have to do
with this?

26:10.444 --> 26:13.281
Well, when you get back,

26:13.364 --> 26:15.866
be nice if we all got together
and broke some bread.

26:15.950 --> 26:18.286
But for now, Dalton’s gonna
cut you a check for 50K.

26:18.369 --> 26:21.414
So you’re not sweating them
while you’re working with us.

26:23.833 --> 26:25.084
Thank you.

26:35.344 --> 26:36.345
[grunts]

26:38.055 --> 26:39.348
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:40.141 --> 26:41.183
Mmm.

26:42.310 --> 26:43.936
Why was your phone off?
[sighs]

26:47.064 --> 26:48.316
I got a job.

26:49.025 --> 26:50.568
You got a job?

26:52.361 --> 26:54.322
What kind of job
did you get?
[inhales]

27:07.251 --> 27:08.669
That kind of job.

27:11.505 --> 27:13.174
It’s babysitting corporates.

27:16.052 --> 27:17.178
It’s not dangerous.

27:17.261 --> 27:18.929
Don’t tell me that.

27:19.013 --> 27:20.514
Now I know you’re lying.
[scoffs]

27:20.598 --> 27:23.726
No, I’m not.
Look at me. I’m not.

27:26.187 --> 27:28.898
[sighs]
Baby, I need to take care
of my family.

27:32.443 --> 27:34.862
[whispering]
You’re gonna miss
Jack’s birthday.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.804
[Tired Eyed Man]
Flight departs in eight hours.

28:41.887 --> 28:45.015
[flight attendant
speaking foreign language]

29:12.460 --> 29:13.919
[knocks]

29:22.052 --> 29:24.180
It take you longer
than 15 minutes to get here?

29:24.263 --> 29:25.806
[Katia]
Only took me eight.

29:29.477 --> 29:34.064
Salim Mohsin, 42.
Professor Emeritus of virology.

29:34.148 --> 29:36.609
Humboldt-Universität, Berlin.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.777
He lectures there
a few times a month,

29:38.861 --> 29:41.030
but his primary focus
is research work

29:41.113 --> 29:45.534
which is conducted
at a private laboratory
40 kilometers east of town.

29:46.368 --> 29:47.495
Threat level?

29:47.578 --> 29:49.872
[Katia] It’s bioterrorism.
Category A.

29:54.919 --> 29:57.213
Car is in the parking lot.
Fiat Tipo.

30:48.097 --> 30:49.848
[thunder rumbling]

30:59.191 --> 31:00.234
[camera shutter clicks]

31:05.781 --> 31:06.782

31:06.865 --> 31:09.785
[vehicle approaches]

31:11.370 --> 31:13.122
[indistinct]

31:19.795 --> 31:21.755
[vehicle departs]

31:25.259 --> 31:26.969

32:17.436 --> 32:19.188
[speaks French]

32:22.983 --> 32:24.485
[Salim speaks French]

32:26.111 --> 32:28.405
[continues speaking French]

33:03.148 --> 33:05.067
[Sylvie] Salim?

33:22.584 --> 33:24.545
[phone vibrates]

33:33.804 --> 33:35.222
[train announcer speaks German]

33:56.952 --> 33:58.746
[beeping]

34:18.098 --> 34:19.099
[gasps]

34:20.559 --> 34:23.061
[Mike] Wakey-wakey,
eggs and bakey.

34:23.145 --> 34:26.482
Time to wake up.
[laughs]

34:37.034 --> 34:38.827
[Mike]
Baseball cards stay here.

34:41.871 --> 34:45.000
Salim Mohamed Mohsin.
Age 42.

34:45.083 --> 34:48.003
Syrian descent.
6’1", 190 pounds.

34:48.085 --> 34:51.340
Dyes his beard.
Heart-shaped birthmark
behind his left ear.

34:51.422 --> 34:54.467
Round-shaped birthmark
on his right wrist.

34:54.551 --> 34:58.263
Harvard Med.
Graduates and receives
a federal research grant

34:58.347 --> 35:02.309
to study pathogenic
influenza viruses in humans.

35:02.392 --> 35:05.312
H1N1 and avian flu mutations.

35:05.395 --> 35:08.023
His grant was not extended.

35:08.106 --> 35:12.778
His family relocated here
to Berlin where he continued
his research.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.823
Financed by Farouk Ojjeh,

35:15.906 --> 35:21.078
the founder of Al Dawaa,
a charity with known links
to al-Qaeda and Syria.

35:21.787 --> 35:22.788
This is a layout

35:22.871 --> 35:25.040
annotated by our inside asset.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.961
The lab only has
moderate security presence

35:29.044 --> 35:32.089
since the guard shack
is connected to Berlin police.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.968
-What kind of doors are they?
-No idea.

35:36.051 --> 35:39.096
- [James] How are we breaching?
- Biometrics. Guard’s thumb.

35:39.179 --> 35:40.681
What happens
when we hit jackpot?

35:40.764 --> 35:42.808
We conduct
a tactical interrogation,

35:42.891 --> 35:45.769
then contact higher
and wait for further
instruction.

35:48.730 --> 35:50.691
Exfil
back through the woods.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.943
Link up with you here.

35:53.026 --> 35:54.653
And then it’s straight
to the airport.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.780
Plane will be ready
at Airfield Alpha.

35:56.864 --> 35:59.533
We all know what one
motivated radical can do,

35:59.616 --> 36:03.871
so let’s cowboy-up, get it done
and go home to our families.

36:06.206 --> 36:07.207
Giddyap.

36:13.213 --> 36:14.298

37:11.563 --> 37:12.731

37:12.814 --> 37:14.316
[sighs]

37:46.098 --> 37:47.849
[crowd on radio cheering]

38:11.373 --> 38:12.416

38:34.187 --> 38:36.398
[biometric scanner beeps]
[locks clicks]

38:43.655 --> 38:44.990
[Mike] Seven minutes.

38:58.503 --> 39:02.758
[piano playing classical music]

39:16.772 --> 39:17.773
[Mike] Up!

39:17.856 --> 39:20.317
[gasps] Was ist das?

39:20.400 --> 39:22.027
-[coughing, panting]
-[James] Stand up.

39:28.909 --> 39:29.868
[Salim grunts]

39:29.951 --> 39:31.286
Six minutes.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.788
[panting]

39:34.414 --> 39:35.957
[Mike]
Need to ask you questions.

39:38.335 --> 39:40.003
Who has access to the lab?

39:41.379 --> 39:44.549
Oh. [pants] Only me.
I have access. It’s...

39:44.633 --> 39:46.176
[Mike] Maggie Bolevska.

39:47.135 --> 39:49.471
Y-Yeah. She’s my...

39:49.554 --> 39:51.807
She’s my research assistant.
She has access.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.642
Who else knows the specifics
of your work?

39:54.601 --> 39:56.144
Nobody. Who are you people?

39:56.228 --> 39:57.562
Your financier?

39:59.272 --> 40:01.858
Y-Yeah, he knows about my work,
but he...

40:01.942 --> 40:04.528
He’s not a scientist. He’s a...
He’s an investor. He’s...

40:05.487 --> 40:07.114
Where do you back up your work?

40:07.197 --> 40:08.615
[scoffs, grunts]

40:08.698 --> 40:12.077
There’s another team on standby
a block away from your family.

40:12.160 --> 40:15.622
Cooperate. There is no limit
to what we are authorized to do.

40:15.705 --> 40:17.541
Where do you
back up your work?

40:19.000 --> 40:21.419
It’s all in here.
It’s in these computers.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.338
There are no lines in or out.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.006
We got it. Payday.

40:25.090 --> 40:29.553
If it’s money you want,
I can arrange money.
It’s really not a problem.

40:31.763 --> 40:32.973
Head against the wall.

40:33.056 --> 40:35.183
[Salim]
I mean... I can really...

40:37.060 --> 40:38.770

40:42.023 --> 40:43.191
[Mike] Oh, shit.

40:43.942 --> 40:44.943
Ears.

40:49.364 --> 40:51.741
Sierra just got a hit
off the scanner.

40:53.368 --> 40:55.120
Police are inbound
from Berlin.

40:57.581 --> 40:59.833
Awaiting instructions
from the ranch.

41:01.877 --> 41:04.004
[phone vibrates]

41:04.087 --> 41:05.130
Code X.

41:05.213 --> 41:06.464
All the way?

41:07.215 --> 41:08.216
All the way.

41:10.594 --> 41:14.264
Industrial accident.
We got five minutes.

41:14.347 --> 41:17.434
Bag the laptop.
Lose the cuffs and hoods.
We were never here.

41:35.035 --> 41:36.119
Get Salim.

41:41.041 --> 41:42.667
[breathes heavily]

41:47.923 --> 41:52.844
Sir... Sir. Sir, please.
This whole thing is...

41:52.928 --> 41:56.473
It’s a misunderstanding.
I’m a... I’m a man of science.

41:56.556 --> 41:59.893
This is... This is
a huge misunderstanding.

41:59.976 --> 42:02.979
Sir! I’m a man of sci...

42:03.063 --> 42:06.733
I’m a man of science.
I have a family, please.

42:06.816 --> 42:08.735
[pants] Sir, please.
I have a family. Please.

42:08.818 --> 42:12.572
No! No! No, no, stop,
stop, stop, stop! [grunts]

42:13.657 --> 42:14.824
Who sent you?

42:14.908 --> 42:17.160
Do you even know
who you’re working for?

42:17.244 --> 42:18.912
You don’t know
what you’re doing.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.873
Stop! Please, listen.

42:21.957 --> 42:25.252
The research I’m doing
will save millions of lives.

42:25.335 --> 42:27.212
[sobs] Stop!

42:27.295 --> 42:28.797
[sobs]
Stop. Stop, please.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.174
If you wanna say a prayer,
now is the time.

42:31.258 --> 42:34.302
A prayer?
I don’t believe in God.
I believe in science.

42:35.971 --> 42:37.180
Listen to me.

42:37.264 --> 42:40.267
I keep a copy of all my data
in a safety deposit box.

42:40.350 --> 42:42.769
If you have a conscience,
get it out.

42:42.852 --> 42:44.854
The world will need it.

42:44.938 --> 42:48.316
[sobs] Stop, stop.
Please, stop.

42:49.276 --> 42:50.735
Please don’t hurt
my family.

42:50.819 --> 42:53.196
Don’t hurt my family.
Stop. Please.

48:25.903 --> 48:27.739
Is the laptop secure?

48:27.822 --> 48:28.865
[James] It’s secure.

48:28.948 --> 48:30.199
[pants]

48:30.283 --> 48:33.286
We got the laptop.
Mission first.

[James grunts, sighs]

48:34.912 --> 48:38.291
I have to give you blood.
Confirm A-pos?

48:38.374 --> 48:40.293
A-pos.
[James sighs]

48:40.376 --> 48:43.171
One of us
has to walk this in.

48:43.254 --> 48:44.964
If you don’t get blood,
you’re gonna die.

48:46.507 --> 48:47.508
You bring it in.

48:47.592 --> 48:49.469
Fuck you. I’m not leaving you.

49:52.490 --> 49:57.328
Uh, William, can you... can you
give us any new information

49:57.412 --> 49:58.871
[William]
Thanks for having me on, Erica.

49:58.955 --> 50:01.124
US officials have been

to our German friends.

50:03.584 --> 50:05.670
[helicopter whirring]

50:16.889 --> 50:19.726
[James grunts]
That makes two you owe me.

50:19.809 --> 50:21.519
How the fuck
did you carry me out?

50:24.397 --> 50:25.857
So what’s the plan?

50:25.940 --> 50:28.985
We get the laptop home.

50:48.296 --> 50:49.630
No, no. We go together.

50:49.714 --> 50:51.758
I’ll compromise
the mission.

50:52.884 --> 50:54.510
We don’t know
what’s in that bag.

50:54.594 --> 50:57.430
Get it home. You go.
I’ll catch up.

51:00.475 --> 51:02.185

51:10.818 --> 51:11.986

Get the fuck outta here.

51:19.285 --> 51:20.661

51:26.709 --> 51:28.294
Yeah.
[zipper closes]

51:33.090 --> 51:35.468

51:35.551 --> 51:37.386

58:09.820 --> 58:10.905
This is Rusty. Go.

58:12.114 --> 58:13.782
I’m on a burner.
It’s not secure.

58:14.408 --> 58:15.409
Copy that.

58:15.492 --> 58:17.870
We don’t have a choice.
Physical condition?

58:18.746 --> 58:20.623
Compromised
but not critical.

58:22.374 --> 58:23.959
Did Wolf Two make contact?

58:24.043 --> 58:26.212
[Rusty] Wolf Two
never made it to Berlin.

58:26.295 --> 58:29.465
I’ve got an extraction team
en route to the hotel,
get you over to the airfield.

58:29.548 --> 58:31.217
Confirm location.

58:36.680 --> 58:38.098
Hey, stay with me.
Confirm location.

58:38.182 --> 58:40.226
[James] I’ll do that
when you brief me on Wolf Two.

58:42.394 --> 58:45.356
[Rusty] You’ll get a full brief
when you’re secure.

58:45.439 --> 58:48.817
Right now everything
is extremely fubar,
and we are highly exposed.

58:48.901 --> 58:51.695
Listen to me.
Everything I am doing right now
is to get you home.

58:51.779 --> 58:53.739
Back to the ranch
safe and sound.
You feel me?

58:53.822 --> 58:57.034
-Yes, sir. Of course.
-Then confirm your location.

58:58.077 --> 58:59.828
Alexanderplatz. Heavy police.

58:59.912 --> 59:01.789
[Rusty] Alexanderplatz.
Copy that. Stand by.

59:02.873 --> 59:04.959
How long to reroute them

Fifteen, 20.

59:06.752 --> 59:08.504

01:00:12.735 --> 01:00:16.322
[James] If Wolf Two
didn’t make it to Berlin,
how’d he arrange my exfil then?

01:00:16.405 --> 01:00:18.532
Look, I understand.
Right now nothing makes sense.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.577
But you gotta trust me.
I am trying to help you.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.329
[James]
Same way you helped Mike?

01:00:25.331 --> 01:00:27.333
You motherfucker.
Did you kill him?

01:00:29.043 --> 01:00:30.711
Who are we working for?

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:35.382
Stop acting like a child
and get in the fucking car.

01:00:35.466 --> 01:00:37.593
[James] If this goes down,
I’m gonna come for you.

01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:39.094
Get in the fucking car.

01:00:39.762 --> 01:00:40.804
Fuck!

01:00:52.066 --> 01:00:54.485
[gunshots]
[people screaming, clamoring]

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.238
[car alarms blaring]
[gunshots]

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:33.941
[grunts]

01:01:40.155 --> 01:01:41.073
[grunts]

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:42.950
[grunts]

01:01:44.076 --> 01:01:45.452
[grunting]

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:49.790
[grunts]
[gunshots]

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:52.459
[gunshots]

01:02:12.438 --> 01:02:14.481
[breathing heavily]

01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:52.311
[both grunting]

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:57.608
[grunting]

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:07.493
[grunting]

01:03:15.209 --> 01:03:16.293
[rats screeching]

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:21.757
[screams]

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:27.888
[screams]

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:30.015
[both grunting]

01:03:35.646 --> 01:03:37.439
[grunting]

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:42.903
[breathing heavily]

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.335
You American?

01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:03.966
[chuckles]
You’re a fucking marine?

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:07.553
Are you a marine?

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:11.473
Was. Recon.

01:04:15.727 --> 01:04:17.145
What was your mission?

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:19.523
Extraction.

01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:22.192
Then the ranch
gave an audible.

01:04:22.276 --> 01:04:23.610
Terminate after pickup.

01:04:24.987 --> 01:04:26.071
When?

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:30.367
On the bridge,
when I saw you.

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:33.036
My partner,
you go after him? Huh?

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:40.794
I heard they picked him up.
I’m sorry.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:44.590
They told us
we’d be saving lives,
not killing our own.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:49.636
My... [gulps]
...picture, please.

01:05:06.987 --> 01:05:08.989
There is...
There’s a safe house.

01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:12.117
Use this code for pickup.

01:05:14.286 --> 01:05:15.495
Take my phone.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:20.792
You can never go home.

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:25.380
The kill code is Tomahawk.

01:05:27.633 --> 01:05:30.969
It’ll stop the team,
at least for a while.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.934
Rusty said
he’d make us all rich.

01:05:48.236 --> 01:05:50.781
[grunting]

01:05:58.288 --> 01:05:59.623
[phone chimes]

01:07:45.896 --> 01:07:47.981
[beeping]

01:08:03.872 --> 01:08:04.956
Kurier.

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:11.171
Yes? [gasps]

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:12.798
- Shh.
- Who are you?
What do you want?

01:08:13.465 --> 01:08:14.466
Who are you?

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:16.384
I’m not here to hurt you
or your family.

01:08:16.468 --> 01:08:19.930
But if you don’t answer
all of my questions, I will.

01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:24.142
Your husband secured
his work someplace safe.
I need to know where.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.728
Sylvie, look at me.
Look at me.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:33.026
For Yanis, for Olivier.
Tell me where.

01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:37.154
- Swiss Credit Bank.
- Swiss Credit Bank?

01:08:38.156 --> 01:08:40.617
- Safe deposit box.
- Safe deposit box.

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.868
[breathes heavily]
Don’t hurt my son.

01:08:42.953 --> 01:08:45.622
Shh, just breathe.
It’s gonna be fine.

01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:49.292
- Tell him to get ready.
- Yes.

01:08:49.376 --> 01:08:53.087
You tell him
I’m an old friend of his dad’s,
and we’re going out for lunch.

01:08:59.261 --> 01:09:01.846
Yanis. [speaks French]

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:07.477
Let’s go.

01:09:39.134 --> 01:09:40.385
He’s coming with me.

01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:42.261
We’ll be here
when you get back.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:44.055
[sighs]

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.142
[speaks French]

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.812
[car door opens, closes]

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:53.064
[footsteps departing]

01:10:09.164 --> 01:10:10.540
You were his friend?

01:10:16.254 --> 01:10:17.672
Yes.

01:10:20.592 --> 01:10:22.052
Are you sad?

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:26.556
Yes.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:29.768
Me too.

01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:06.221
Where did you meet?

01:11:06.972 --> 01:11:08.056
Paris.

01:11:10.517 --> 01:11:12.519
Where was your first child born?

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:16.690
[Yanis] I was born...
[shushes] Tais-toi!

01:11:19.067 --> 01:11:20.860
I have two boys to raise.

01:11:21.987 --> 01:11:24.406
Everything we have
is in your hands.

01:11:27.075 --> 01:11:28.410
Answer the question.

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:35.041
[inhales] Um...
Yanis was born in Boston.

01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:37.377
[keyboard tapping]

01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:42.799
[James] What were you gonna call
your third child?

01:11:49.097 --> 01:11:50.181
Jordan.

01:11:50.265 --> 01:11:51.266
[keyboard tapping]

01:11:52.934 --> 01:11:53.935
[Sylvie sniffs]

01:11:54.728 --> 01:11:55.729
Stop the car.

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:01.943
So, how much
did they pay you, huh?

01:12:04.279 --> 01:12:06.072
I hope it was worth it.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:29.888
[Virgil] Yes?

01:12:29.971 --> 01:12:33.683
Recon. 6-22-34. Mayday.

01:12:34.642 --> 01:12:35.935
[Virgil] Copy. Location?

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:37.187
Berlin.

01:12:37.896 --> 01:12:38.897
[Virgil] Condition?

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.356
Mobile.

01:12:42.067 --> 01:12:46.321
[Virgil] 0300 tomorrow.
GPS 14.98, 51.150.

01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:06.424
[Virgil] Are you lost?

01:13:06.508 --> 01:13:08.384
[music playing on stereo]

01:13:08.468 --> 01:13:09.636
[James breathes heavily]

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:11.721
[Virgil]
Do you mind lowering the gun?

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:16.768
You called me.

01:13:20.522 --> 01:13:22.982
It’s the price
of admission.

01:13:31.616 --> 01:13:33.910
-[grunts]
-[music fades]

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:44.462
[kettle whistling]
[monitor beeping]

01:13:48.133 --> 01:13:49.634
[whistling stops]

01:14:00.228 --> 01:14:02.230
[footsteps approaching]

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:11.447
[beeping speeds up]

01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:13.283
[grunting]

01:14:13.867 --> 01:14:15.160
[James yells]

01:14:16.411 --> 01:14:18.037
There’s no need
to fight anymore.

01:14:18.121 --> 01:14:19.664
[James breathes heavily]

01:14:26.087 --> 01:14:27.922
Where’s my bag?
[breathing heavily]

01:14:41.102 --> 01:14:44.564
So... are we good?

01:15:01.039 --> 01:15:03.583
[grunts, breathes heavily]

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:10.006
It’s okay.
You’re safe here.

01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:13.384
I cleaned your knee.
It was badly infected.

01:15:13.468 --> 01:15:16.971
You tore your ACL. I don’t
know how you walked on it,
but you did.

01:15:17.055 --> 01:15:18.932
The marine
who told me about you...

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:21.601
You know him?

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:24.270
No.

01:15:26.064 --> 01:15:27.065
Did you kill him?

01:15:29.609 --> 01:15:33.905
[scoffs]
No, but I know they train us
to run their errands.

01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:36.532
Kill their enemies
and kill each other.

01:15:36.616 --> 01:15:40.620
"National security."
It’s just a rock they can hide
their dirty shit under.

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:42.121
I need to get back.

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:43.206
Back where?

01:15:43.289 --> 01:15:45.583
[breathes heavily]
Back home.

01:15:49.254 --> 01:15:50.630
That’s done.

01:15:52.507 --> 01:15:54.008
Home is a memory.

01:15:56.177 --> 01:15:57.762
[grunts, gasps]

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:01.933
You need... You almost died.

01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:03.768
- Your body needs rest.
- I’m fine.

01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:05.561
- Shh. All right.
- I’m fine.

01:16:12.443 --> 01:16:14.320
[breathes heavily]

01:16:18.366 --> 01:16:21.828
[Salim]
Yanis, in case I’m not here
to tell you this in person,

01:16:22.787 --> 01:16:24.163
I love you.

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:27.333
I know you have felt my absence
these last few years.

01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:29.252
I need you to know why.

01:16:29.335 --> 01:16:31.462
[inhales]
I made up my mind
very early

01:16:31.546 --> 01:16:34.007
that my children
would live without fear.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:38.845
And because of that,
I chose to dedicate my life
to science.

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:42.140
Unfortunately,
there are powerful people
who ignore science,

01:16:42.223 --> 01:16:44.892
even subvert it
for their own personal gain.

01:16:46.311 --> 01:16:50.315
Yanis, in your hands
is my life’s work:

01:16:50.398 --> 01:16:55.111
the vaccine for the H5N1 virus
with a mortality rate of 16%.

01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:02.035
It may have landed me
in this chair, staring into this
camera instead of your eyes,

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.997
but I want you to know
that your father stood
for something,

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.833
created something
that with your help

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:13.087
will benefit humanity
long after they’ve shot me down.

01:17:13.171 --> 01:17:16.007
It is very important
that this vaccine is available

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:18.551
free to the public
should the unthinkable happen.

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:28.895
[inhales]

01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:34.067
[Virgil] Dear Lord,
thank you for this meal

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:36.903
and bringing my guest
here safely.

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:39.822
Forgive us our sins
and keep us
from the fires of hell.

01:17:39.906 --> 01:17:42.408
May our souls
go to heaven.

01:17:42.492 --> 01:17:45.995
Especially those
in need of thy mercy.
Amen.

01:17:46.079 --> 01:17:47.163
Amen.

01:17:50.458 --> 01:17:54.462
Your tat. OD3224.

01:17:54.545 --> 01:17:56.172
That’s tip of the spear.

01:17:56.255 --> 01:17:57.423
Mmm.

01:17:59.342 --> 01:18:00.927
Yeah,
they kept us busy.

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:03.971
In Iraq or Afghanistan?

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:08.434
Both.

01:18:14.649 --> 01:18:16.484
You ever been
to Hindu Kush?

01:18:19.362 --> 01:18:21.948
Mountains so high,
you think heaven’s
resting on ’em.

01:18:23.074 --> 01:18:25.535
The valleys so green,
you think it’s Eden.

01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:29.330
I thought I was in Colorado
when I first saw it.

01:18:39.507 --> 01:18:41.551
You know, we were
on a 12-day straight

01:18:42.927 --> 01:18:45.555
looking for one of
our local guys’ kid.

01:18:45.638 --> 01:18:49.642
Been gone... Gone hunting,
couldn’t find him.
Poor thing.

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:52.979
So we broke down a door
on this out-of-the-way compound,

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:55.064
and then we burst in.

01:18:55.148 --> 01:18:57.358
And once we cleared everything,
we found him, the kid.

01:18:57.442 --> 01:19:00.361
And he was chained to the wall,
just crying his eyes out.

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:04.490
But in the next room,
it’s full of girls

01:19:04.574 --> 01:19:07.243
all strung out, splayed out.

01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:10.872
And in the middle
of all this was a dog.

01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:13.458
It’s just a little thing.

01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:16.085
Mangy. Happy as can be.

01:19:16.169 --> 01:19:18.963
Happy to see us.
All yelps and matted hair.

01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:25.052
And all that shit,
and the thing I remember
the most is the dog.

01:19:27.263 --> 01:19:30.975
’Cause that dog
survived all that shit
without even blinking an eye.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.066
It’s much easier to kill,

01:19:40.651 --> 01:19:43.237
but it’s harder to survive.

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:57.793
How long
you been out here?

01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:00.671
Thirteen years.

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:06.928
You have a family?

01:20:07.011 --> 01:20:09.847
Yeah, I’ve got a wife,
two beautiful girls,

01:20:11.015 --> 01:20:12.266
a nice house.

01:20:13.935 --> 01:20:15.311
You ever feel
like reaching out?

01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:16.604
[sighs]

01:20:20.066 --> 01:20:21.567
When I reach out...

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:24.779
I break things.

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:29.158
We all know the monster.

01:20:30.368 --> 01:20:32.286
And sometimes
he comes to stay.

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:44.131
How’s the steak?

01:20:46.884 --> 01:20:47.927
I’ve had better.

01:20:48.761 --> 01:20:51.597
So... So have I. [laughs]

01:20:51.681 --> 01:20:53.182
[chuckles]

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:56.852
[gunshots]

01:21:01.941 --> 01:21:03.442
[record player dies down]

01:21:08.656 --> 01:21:10.366
[panting]

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.476
[gas hissing]

01:22:03.461 --> 01:22:06.088
[hissing continues]

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:14.138
[footsteps approaching]

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:32.531
[engine starts]

01:22:37.912 --> 01:22:39.205
[truck horn honks]

01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:53.988
Hi.

01:23:54.071 --> 01:23:55.990
- American?
- Yes.

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:00.578
Safe travels, sir.

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:35.780
[Mike] I want Christine
to hear about me from you.

01:24:35.863 --> 01:24:39.158
[James]
You tell ’em yourself, Mike.
Tell ’em yourself.

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:16.070
[James] Motherfucker.

01:27:15.022 --> 01:27:16.315
Doing at my house?

01:27:18.609 --> 01:27:19.818
Answer me.

01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:23.447
[grunts]
You wanna shoot me?

01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:26.450
[panting] Go ahead.

01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:42.424
I went to your house
to tell Christine,
like you asked me to.

01:27:42.508 --> 01:27:44.969
-Rusty said...
-Did you know
he was coming after me?

01:27:45.928 --> 01:27:47.554
He said you didn’t make it.

01:27:47.638 --> 01:27:48.847
Why did you lie to me?

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:50.808
- About what?
- [James] Fuck you.

01:27:50.891 --> 01:27:53.769
A real home. A tribe.
Honorable work.

01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:56.188
It was a data heist.
None of this was supposed
to happen.

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:58.273
But it did happen.
And for what?

01:27:58.357 --> 01:27:59.733
Payday of a lifetime.

01:28:01.443 --> 01:28:02.444
[grunts]

01:28:03.737 --> 01:28:05.447
What we stole
was not data.

01:28:06.865 --> 01:28:09.535
It’s a cure to a virus
these fuckers wanna release.

01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:13.455
So they can make billions
off people suffering.
Did you know that?

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:17.543
How do you fucking
live with yourself?

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:20.462
I got a family
and a son with special needs.

01:28:20.546 --> 01:28:23.173
[James] So what about my family?
My son! Their needs!

01:28:23.257 --> 01:28:24.675
Everything’s taken care of.

01:28:24.758 --> 01:28:27.094
There’s a huge payout
to Brianne and your boy.
Four million.

01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:28.804
They’ll never want
for anything ever again.

01:28:28.887 --> 01:28:31.223
Except for me! Me!

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:33.767
You can’t go home!

01:28:33.851 --> 01:28:37.479
He finds out you’re here,
he’s gonna come after you
with everything he’s got.

01:28:41.358 --> 01:28:42.860
After everything
we’ve done,

01:28:42.943 --> 01:28:44.236
everything
we’ve been through.

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:46.280
I fucking bled for you!

01:28:48.198 --> 01:28:49.491
And this is what I get?

01:29:00.878 --> 01:29:02.129
[sobs]

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:06.592
James, don’t do this.

01:29:07.801 --> 01:29:09.094
I’m sorry.

01:29:14.558 --> 01:29:15.684
[sniffles]

01:29:24.735 --> 01:29:27.237
[crying]

01:29:34.078 --> 01:29:36.330
[sobbing]

01:29:40.292 --> 01:29:42.377
My father, uh...
[sniffs]

01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:48.258
He branded me to be like him.

01:29:48.342 --> 01:29:52.763
You know, a fucking...
a fucking Ranger to the bone.

01:29:55.849 --> 01:29:58.685
And when they cut him loose
and they cast him out,

01:29:58.769 --> 01:30:00.270
he just never came home.

01:30:01.355 --> 01:30:02.397
[grunts]

01:30:05.984 --> 01:30:06.985
[sniffs]

01:30:07.069 --> 01:30:09.822
Vanished. No note, corpse.
Fucking nothing.

01:30:14.118 --> 01:30:18.956
I finally just buried
all the... shit the fucker
ever gave me in the backyard.

01:30:19.039 --> 01:30:22.126
Had my own funeral.
[sobbing]

01:30:23.710 --> 01:30:26.755
I’m standing over
this pathetic little hole
filled with stupid shit.

01:30:26.839 --> 01:30:29.049
And I swore to myself
I would never be like him.

01:30:29.133 --> 01:30:32.761
I would never forsake my family.
[shouts] Do you understand me?

01:30:37.349 --> 01:30:39.309
[chuckles]
Rusty finds out you’re here,

01:30:39.393 --> 01:30:41.186
he’s gonna come
after your family.

01:30:42.563 --> 01:30:44.314
There’s only one way this ends.

01:31:34.031 --> 01:31:35.324
Hey, what’s up, Mike?

01:31:35.407 --> 01:31:37.576
You got a beer?
Where is he?

01:31:37.659 --> 01:31:38.911
He’s in the kitchen.

01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:45.167
[grunts]

01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:50.380
[gunfire]

01:31:59.097 --> 01:32:02.601
[machine gun fire]

01:32:13.195 --> 01:32:14.238
[gunshot]

01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:29.378
[shells clattering]

01:32:34.675 --> 01:32:35.676
[grunts]

01:32:37.719 --> 01:32:39.388
[grunting]

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:50.774
[both grunting]

01:32:51.650 --> 01:32:52.651
[grunts]

01:33:06.456 --> 01:33:07.749
[groans]

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:09.793
[grunting]

01:33:26.643 --> 01:33:27.853
[groans]

01:33:36.069 --> 01:33:37.237
[grunts]

01:33:41.533 --> 01:33:42.534
[grunts]

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:44.661
[groans]

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.768
[Rusty grunting, groaning]

01:34:16.401 --> 01:34:17.819
[grunting]

01:34:34.169 --> 01:34:37.047
Always wanted to die
with my boots on.

01:34:38.423 --> 01:34:39.424
[grunts]

01:34:39.508 --> 01:34:40.759
[shell clatters]

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:45.472
[pants, grunts]

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.185
[grunts,
breathes heavily]

01:34:55.565 --> 01:34:58.443
[James] I got a room
prepped and ready for ya.

01:34:59.861 --> 01:35:01.238
We’re going home, Mike.

01:35:01.988 --> 01:35:04.324
[breathing heavily]

01:35:04.408 --> 01:35:06.535
Put some fucking music on.

01:35:06.618 --> 01:35:07.786
Yeah.

01:35:07.869 --> 01:35:09.371
[radio turns on]

01:35:09.454 --> 01:35:12.207
[country song playing]

01:35:13.333 --> 01:35:14.376
Cold.

01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:25.137
[sighs]

01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:27.973
Tell my s...

01:35:34.521 --> 01:35:37.732
My son... [wheezes]

01:35:42.487 --> 01:35:44.448
I didn’t die in my sleep.

01:35:50.912 --> 01:35:52.038
I promise.

01:35:54.833 --> 01:35:55.959
I got you.

01:36:46.218 --> 01:36:48.094
Yeah! Cannonball!

01:36:55.018 --> 01:36:56.019
Yeah!

01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:58.313
[Brianne] Good job!

01:37:34.516 --> 01:37:35.725
[James] Jack!
