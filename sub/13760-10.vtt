01:21.782 --> 01:24.049
You try and get some scumbag
from Florida to kill him?

01:24.051 --> 01:25.451
Doesn't matter.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.952
At the very least,

01:26.954 --> 01:28.921
the Jimenez people
will know I'm serious.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.255
You know, this thing with Eric

01:30.257 --> 01:31.623
that anything is possible
with me.

He's protected.

You really think
they're going to start a war

of Sinaloa?

01:37.398 --> 01:39.631

Well it's not like
I had any option, right?

01:41.569 --> 01:43.969

couldn't take

01:47.441 --> 01:49.408

01:49.410 --> 01:50.809
"Couldn't" is not
the word to use.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.212
"Couldn't" insults me.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.147
"Wouldn't" would be
more accurate.

01:55.149 --> 01:58.317
You want to stay in Texas
and stir shit up,

01:58.319 --> 02:00.719
maybe I will let
what's coming to you come.

You're the one
that's called.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.823
I'm not asking
for your help anymore.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.558
You know I can't
let anything happen to you.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.793
How can I?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.795
How can I look
at my daughter and say,

02:09.797 --> 02:14.800
"I did everything I could,
but they got her anyway"?

02:14.802 --> 02:16.902
That I let your own
pigheadedness kill you?

02:16.904 --> 02:18.437
Listen,
you need to come home

02:18.439 --> 02:20.272
until I speak to Jimenez.

02:20.274 --> 02:22.975
Tell them your attempt on
Birdman's life was a mistake.

02:22.977 --> 02:25.344
They haven't even returned
my phone call yet,

02:25.346 --> 02:27.346
and that's making me
very nervous.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.281
I'm not coming home.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.183
EPIFANIO: Yes.
You need to be safe.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.452
-No.
-Yes, home.

02:33.454 --> 02:38.423
You will come home
until this is resolved.

02:38.425 --> 02:42.427
Okay, I can see
that you're serious.

02:42.429 --> 02:44.263
But this is not
an admission of defeat.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.497
This is just temporary,

02:45.499 --> 02:48.200
until you make peace.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.601

Be on it.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.471
(phone beeps)

02:52.473 --> 02:55.174
Should I make preparations
for your trip?

02:55.176 --> 02:58.010
No, I'm already packed.

02:58.012 --> 03:01.046
How do you know he was going to
ask you to go back to Mexico?

03:01.048 --> 03:05.317
I've been walking around
that ego for 25 years.

03:05.319 --> 03:09.454
It's like a bad road that you
learn to know all the bumps.

03:09.456 --> 03:10.889
Have you heard from James?

03:10.891 --> 03:13.392
No, he's still searching
for the maid.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.494
Send my suitcase

03:30.911 --> 03:34.513
You pay the fine downtown,

Even the chickens under
the porch understand that.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.483
Yeah, someone's going to
take care of it.

03:38.485 --> 03:40.085

03:40.087 --> 03:43.322
Well, if that's your car,
don't you know?

03:45.659 --> 03:47.759
It was stolen before

I encouraged Eric

something to do

31:59.685 --> 32:01.451
