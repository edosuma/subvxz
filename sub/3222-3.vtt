WEBVTT

00:03.604 --> 00:05.765
I'm having a difficult time
figuring out what's real.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.771
- Hallucinations?
- Sometimes I see Lucifer.

00:07.942 --> 00:09.375
Are you seeing him right now?

00:10.678 --> 00:12.839
Let me see your hand.
I was with you when you cut it.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.276
I sewed it up.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.376
This is real.

00:18.052 --> 00:20.850
There are things much older
than souls in purgatory.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.650
- And you gulped those in too.
- I can't hold them back.

00:23.825 --> 00:25.452
- Hold who back?
- Leviathan!

00:28.529 --> 00:31.225
- Those whatever you call them...
- Leviathan.

00:31.399 --> 00:34.630
If they're in the pipes, they got
themselves a highway to anywhere.

00:35.570 --> 00:38.198
Something is eating folks
down at Sioux Falls Hospital.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.569
A few of us in the right positions,
and we could feast every day.

00:41.776 --> 00:43.573
Meet you at the house.
We can regroup.

00:43.778 --> 00:46.076
That place was torched.
Somebody knew what they were doing.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.804
- Bobby!
- Oh, no.

00:53.688 --> 00:56.589
Two males: One head trauma,
one open compound tibia fracture.

00:56.791 --> 00:59.021
- En route to Sioux Falls.
- Sioux Falls General?

00:59.193 --> 01:01.184
You gotta take us somewhere else.
Please.

01:02.697 --> 01:04.391
Hey, so maybe I'm not real.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.362
But I'm not going anywhere, Sam.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.225
Sammy? You stay with me, you hear?

01:09.670 --> 01:11.001
- He's seizing.
- Sammy!

01:14.709 --> 01:16.677
<i>Incoming cranial trauma to MRI.</i>

01:17.011 --> 01:18.239
Pulse is weak.

01:20.815 --> 01:22.680
Pulse and BP?

01:23.017 --> 01:24.177
He's coming around.

01:24.352 --> 01:26.877
- Stand by.
- No response.

01:27.054 --> 01:28.453
- Hold him down.
- Hey.

01:28.623 --> 01:31.251
Three, two, one, set.

01:32.627 --> 01:33.855
- Nurse.
- Ugh!

01:34.762 --> 01:36.787
- Just relax.
- Where am I?

01:36.964 --> 01:38.955
- You're at the hospital.
- Which one?

01:39.133 --> 01:41.124
Sioux Falls General.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.536
Where's my brother?
We gotta go.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.400
He bashed his head seriously.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.804
- He's gone up for an MRI.
- Okay. I gotta go.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.637
You're not going anywhere on this leg.

01:50.845 --> 01:51.937
- No.
- Relax.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.372
I'm just...

02:08.596 --> 02:12.657
<i>Dr. Aaron Howard, extension 4237.</i>

02:19.907 --> 02:22.171
No, no, no.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.586
What...?

02:44.098 --> 02:45.395
You okay?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.592
Bobby, you're alive.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.793
Of course I am.
Why are you on the floor?

02:51.005 --> 02:53.166
They gave me morphine. A lot.

02:53.441 --> 02:56.308
Hey, look, a monster broke my leg.

02:59.714 --> 03:01.181
Wait.

03:01.349 --> 03:04.182
- The house. We thought you were dead.
- Well, I ain't.

03:04.619 --> 03:06.143
Not yet.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.548
But we gotta run.

03:07.722 --> 03:09.713
This place ain't safe.

03:10.491 --> 03:11.515
Where's Sam?

03:11.692 --> 03:13.819
Uh, head scan, I think.

03:13.995 --> 03:15.826
Meet me at the ambulance dock, stat.

03:15.997 --> 03:18.158
- I'll find Sam.
- Wait, where?

03:18.699 --> 03:20.166
Bobby, I'm a gimp.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.062
Hey.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.310
You've scheduled dessert, I presume.

03:38.386 --> 03:39.876
Yes?

03:40.655 --> 03:41.713
The Winchesters?

03:56.203 --> 03:59.070
Hold the phone there, son.
Who's this?

03:59.740 --> 04:01.173
Yeah, this is the guy.

04:01.342 --> 04:04.368
Coverage lapsed.
We're shipping him to county.

04:05.179 --> 04:08.239
Come on. Let's get you
healed up someplace safer.

04:48.823 --> 04:50.017
Come on, Dean.

04:52.727 --> 04:53.785
Balls.

04:56.230 --> 04:57.288
Come on, Dean.

04:57.465 --> 04:59.092
Come on, Dean.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.432
Go, go, go!

05:46.147 --> 05:47.512
Dude. Ricardo.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.478
What happened?

05:58.025 --> 05:59.993
Well, this ought to cheer you up.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.357
My baby.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.894
I gotta get this thing off
and I can drive again.

06:05.099 --> 06:07.192
So how is it out there?

06:07.835 --> 06:09.632
Weird with a side order of bloody.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.971
Talked to a few hunters.

06:12.139 --> 06:15.506
Running into the same kind of thing
that set up shop at that hospital.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.735
Don't forget tried to kill us
at your place.

06:17.912 --> 06:21.746
Well, consensus is they're, uh...
They're like Shapeshifters...

06:21.916 --> 06:23.713
...only a lot more into eating folk.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.220
And nothing can kill them.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.751
Good times. Anything else?

06:29.924 --> 06:31.391
Yep. They bleed black goo.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.550
Like that stuff that came out of Cass.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.592
Those things from purgatory, uh...

06:35.763 --> 06:36.991
Leviathan.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.222
Yep.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.333
Those chompers at the hospital?

06:40.501 --> 06:42.401
They still making spleenburgers?

06:42.570 --> 06:45.505
Yeah. I made calls. That doctor
never showed back up to work.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.402
Ditto a nurse, some administrator...

06:47.575 --> 06:48.735
<i>You never left, Sam.</i>

06:48.909 --> 06:51.036
<i>- Could be at any hospital.
- Never left.</i>

06:51.212 --> 06:53.772
- Yeah.
- What do you think, Sammy?

06:55.382 --> 06:56.872
Sammy?

06:57.451 --> 06:59.078
<i>- Sam.
- Sam.</i>

06:59.253 --> 07:00.880
Hey, ground control.

07:01.055 --> 07:02.522
Sam!

07:06.527 --> 07:08.518
Yeah. What? I'm... I'm right here.

07:08.696 --> 07:11.187
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

07:16.737 --> 07:17.795
Good.

07:18.472 --> 07:22.272
Every last bit of info I ever had
burned down, so...

07:22.443 --> 07:24.934
This place? Rufus leave anything?
Check the basement?

07:25.112 --> 07:26.545
C rations and dust.

07:26.714 --> 07:29.410
I don't think he had been here
in years.

07:29.717 --> 07:32.550
So I gotta go round up my old library.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.585
You said those books were
one of a kind.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.315
Yeah. That's why I stashed copies
all over the place.

07:40.394 --> 07:41.986
Okay, good. Uh...

07:42.696 --> 07:45.961
Hey, uh, two-legs, we're fresh out of
grub. You wanna make a run?

07:47.067 --> 07:48.091
Sure, yeah.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.460
Be careful with her, would you?

07:51.639 --> 07:52.731
And, uh, Sam.

07:54.008 --> 07:55.202
Yeah?

07:55.609 --> 07:57.770
- Pie.
- Obviously. Heh.

08:03.284 --> 08:05.013
- So?
- So what?

08:05.653 --> 08:09.020
<i>Before you bail again, Girl, Interrupted
over there. Any thoughts?</i>

08:10.791 --> 08:12.258
Looks like he's doing better.

08:12.426 --> 08:14.257
What do you mean better?
You just saw him.

08:14.428 --> 08:16.794
Saw him check out once.
That's progress.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.194
- You're kidding.
- Look, seems to me...

08:19.366 --> 08:21.766
...Sam's head ain't no different
than your leg.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.460
People heal on a curve.

08:23.637 --> 08:27.095
Not diff... Bobby, I get this thing off
in five days, I'm golden.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.435
Sam is not a curve.
He's a freaking time bomb.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.703
It ain't like he's keeping secrets.
What you see is what you get.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.871
What's so nuts
about calling an upswing?

08:35.683 --> 08:37.947
Because that's not how it works, Bobby.
Ever.

08:38.118 --> 08:42.054
All right? Especially not with Sam.
The other shoe is gonna drop.

08:42.256 --> 08:44.690
- It's just a matter of when.
- How about we worry...

08:44.858 --> 08:48.385
...about today's problems?
And today, we need intel.

08:48.562 --> 08:49.654
I'm going...

08:49.830 --> 08:51.661
...you sit there and stew.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.299
I'll check in.

08:55.402 --> 08:58.337
Look,
you sitting here wringing your hands...

08:58.505 --> 09:00.370
...ain't gonna do nothing.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.032
Maybe he'll surprise you.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.059
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:37.311 --> 09:38.778
Paper too?

09:38.946 --> 09:41.881
Uh, yeah. Yeah, please.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.946
Here.

09:54.395 --> 09:56.920
You see any other strange
charges on your statement?

09:57.931 --> 10:01.196
May 27th charge to Mistress Magda.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.201
Uh, sorry for asking.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.432
We're gonna have to call you back.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.083
<i>- Yes?
- Yes, sir.</i>

10:20.254 --> 10:22.779
Winchesters have triggered
one of my search programs.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.719
<i>- Great.
- A shop in Montana.</i>

10:24.892 --> 10:25.950
<i>A day and a half...</i>

10:26.126 --> 10:27.889
<i>- ... maybe two days from here.
- So?</i>

10:29.096 --> 10:32.259
- So...?
- So why are you still talking to me?

10:36.670 --> 10:39.969
- Ah. Thank you.
- Yep.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.473
Where's Bobby?

10:43.644 --> 10:45.805
- Did he take off?
- Yeah.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.473
Hey, Sam, how you doing?

10:49.516 --> 10:50.608
Fine.

10:52.586 --> 10:55.612
I mean, you still... You know?

10:56.623 --> 11:00.423
Yeah. No, I know what you mean.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.925
Yeah,
I'm still seeing crap that's not real.

11:04.298 --> 11:05.925
But, yeah, I'm fine.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.762
I mean, I can tell the difference.

11:10.671 --> 11:11.968
Think it's getting better?

11:13.173 --> 11:14.970
Honestly? Uh...

11:15.843 --> 11:17.504
I don't know.

11:18.479 --> 11:20.106
I know I'm managing it, so...

11:21.215 --> 11:22.512
So don't worry.

11:29.123 --> 11:30.954
Where's the pie?

11:32.726 --> 11:34.557
I got cake.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.491
It's close enough, right?

12:03.857 --> 12:06.018
From what I can tell...

12:06.193 --> 12:08.991
...it's something called a Kitsune.

12:09.496 --> 12:13.364
Not much. They look human.
Till they sprout out claws...

12:13.534 --> 12:16.230
...and stab you behind your ear
to get to your brain.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.739
I don't know yet.

12:21.375 --> 12:23.900
Yes, Dean,
I realize killing them is important.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.773
Maybe if Uncle Bobby sent a book
in English.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.038
I am.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.373
No, no. Don't put him on the phone.

12:31.718 --> 12:33.413
Hi, Dad.

12:35.789 --> 12:36.915
Yes, sir.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.388
I realize people are dying.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.358
Yeah. I'm on my way
to the library right now.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.565
<i>The most horrifying
3-D motion picture experience...</i>

12:50.737 --> 12:52.068
<i>...to rip across the theater.</i>

12:52.239 --> 12:54.070
<i>Wait, exactly what did you see?</i>

12:54.241 --> 12:57.301
<i>Look, someone
or something was behind us.</i>

12:57.511 --> 12:58.535
<i>Oh, my!</i>

13:00.614 --> 13:04.983
<i>There's no date night
like a 3-D ride to hell.</i>

13:05.152 --> 13:07.620
<i>No. No, no!</i>

13:07.788 --> 13:13.021
<i>My Bloodiest Valentine
in hell-ovision 3-D.</i>

13:20.267 --> 13:23.134
Sorry, honey. Price went up.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.271
Fifty-five.

13:34.648 --> 13:37.014
I, uh... I don't have it.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.776
That's too bad.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.686
Maybe we can make a little trade,
hmm?

14:24.231 --> 14:26.563
<i>In the savannah,
the wildebeest lounges...</i>

14:26.733 --> 14:27.893
<i>...lazy and self-content...</i>

14:28.101 --> 14:31.628
<i>...is oblivious to the fierce predator
that stalks him from the shadows.</i>

14:31.805 --> 14:34.137
<i>The merest rustle of wind
through the bushes...</i>

14:34.341 --> 14:37.105
<i>...can spur the entire herd

14:45.819 --> 14:48.083
- Other shoe.
- Other who?

14:48.255 --> 14:50.314
<i>Sam. He took off.</i>

14:50.490 --> 14:52.583
<i>- Where?
- I don't know. Nowhere good.</i>

14:52.759 --> 14:54.351
Maybe needed a little me-time.

14:54.528 --> 14:56.393
Yeah. But his me-time ain't just him.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.225
I mean, for all we know he's
road-tripping with Lucifer somewhere.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.431
Left me here
like Jimmy friggin' Stewart.

15:02.636 --> 15:03.660
I assume you called.

15:03.837 --> 15:05.930
<i>Voice mail. Turned his GPS off too.</i>

15:06.139 --> 15:07.663
And he took my car.

15:07.841 --> 15:09.570
<i>- Don't panic.
- Too late.</i>

15:09.743 --> 15:13.770
Look, he says he's okay,
so give it a couple of days.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.909
<i>Just till you get the cast off.</i>

15:16.249 --> 15:18.080
And then hunt him down.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.379
<i>- Till then, we'll both just keep calling.
- All right.</i>

15:28.228 --> 15:30.389
You're going down.

15:36.169 --> 15:39.036
You think this is another one?
So-called ice pick killer?

15:39.206 --> 15:41.800
Same MO. Can't say I'm too broken up
about this one.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.067
You knew him?

15:43.243 --> 15:45.541
Busted him half a dozen times.
Real mensch.

15:45.712 --> 15:46.872
So, what's the deal?

15:47.047 --> 15:49.538
Um, killer comes to town,
ganks a lowlife, moves along?

15:49.716 --> 15:52.207
- Looks like.
- Stabs them all exactly the same, right?

15:52.386 --> 15:54.752
- Behind the ear?
- Yeah. No explaining a psycho.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.586
We left that detail out of the paper.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.889
- How did you know?
- I worked a case like this years back.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.252
Think it's related?

16:03.964 --> 16:07.058
- Find anything weird about the brains?
- Like what?

16:07.401 --> 16:09.232
Like missing?

16:09.403 --> 16:11.997
Heh, good question for the coroner.

16:12.205 --> 16:13.263
Right. Thanks.

16:37.164 --> 16:41.498
How you doing? Uh, was there a, uh,
big guy in here yesterday?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.860
That's specific.

16:44.304 --> 16:48.604
- Uh, I mean, big. Like about yay high?
- Yeah, maybe.

16:48.942 --> 16:51.968
- Uh, brown hair?
- Yes, yes. That's him.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.375
- You, uh, remember what he bought?
- Snacks, maybe.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.716
A paper?
Do you have yesterday's paper?

16:57.884 --> 16:59.852
- Yeah, right there.
- Oh.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.753
Do you mind?

17:12.799 --> 17:15.131
We don't get too many murders
out this way.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.335
- Much less a serial.
- What did you find?

17:18.505 --> 17:21.565
It's what we didn't find.
Let me show you.

17:22.476 --> 17:25.172
Big chunk of midbrain went missing.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.671
Midbrain, like pituitary gland?

17:28.849 --> 17:31.409
Actually,
their pituitaries were clear gone.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.213
How did you know that?

17:34.855 --> 17:38.655
Yeah. So they need a steady diet
of human pituitary glands to survive.

17:39.526 --> 17:40.993
Educated guess.

17:49.736 --> 17:50.896
Hang on. Slow down.

17:54.674 --> 17:55.902
Right.

17:56.076 --> 17:59.807
So the victims are located in parks
just off the highway.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.940
Just one per town.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.446
That's something.

18:05.519 --> 18:06.611
What?

18:06.820 --> 18:09.846
I'm just tired. I've been looking at this
for like eight years.

18:11.892 --> 18:12.950
Wait, hang on.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.957
I'll call you right back.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.985
Triple red eye, please.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.453
Okay.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.863
Triple red eye.

19:01.007 --> 19:02.599
Thanks.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.160
You stab it in the heart.

20:05.372 --> 20:08.432
Stab it. The heart.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.674
I said you stab it in the heart!

20:11.845 --> 20:12.869
Shh.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.373
Okay. You guys cool?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.983
Can I have a normal life
for five minutes now?

20:20.320 --> 20:23.756
Oh, Dean, quick question:

20:24.457 --> 20:26.152
How do you talk to girls?

20:38.838 --> 20:43.571
Um, I just wanted to...

20:43.743 --> 20:46.177
...you know, say hi...
No. Go away.

20:52.619 --> 20:55.019
It's just I'm not
supposed to talk to boys.

21:14.007 --> 21:15.406
Check it out.

21:24.584 --> 21:25.608
Leave me alone.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.616
- We just wanna talk.
- I have to go.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.277
Uh, uh, uh, why so rude?

21:30.256 --> 21:31.780
- Don't touch me.
- I said be nice.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.755
Why don't you?

21:33.927 --> 21:35.019
Butt out.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.794
Can you believe this guy?

21:47.440 --> 21:49.032
Come on. Let's get out of here.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.101
Hi. I'm Sam.

21:53.680 --> 21:54.942
I'm Amy.

22:18.972 --> 22:20.667
Damn it.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.109
Hi, Amy.

22:39.793 --> 22:42.557
Sam. Wow.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.196
Yeah.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.698
I just never thought I'd see you again.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.529
- What are you doing here?
- I think you know.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.136
You got tall, huh?

22:52.806 --> 22:54.706
Small talk? Really?

22:56.109 --> 22:57.337
- Let's take a walk.
- Sam...

22:57.510 --> 22:58.568
Walk.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.713
So same pattern, same victim pool.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.316
- Just like when we were kids?
- No. It's not what... Look, I'm...

23:04.484 --> 23:06.884
I've had the same job
for the last six years.

23:07.053 --> 23:10.420
I have a house, two cats, a mortgage.
I have a normal life.

23:11.391 --> 23:12.483
You call this normal?

23:14.561 --> 23:16.222
Ready to play doctor?

23:18.898 --> 23:21.093
<i>But that's all it is</i>

23:21.267 --> 23:23.394
- So are you gonna tell me?
- What?

23:24.237 --> 23:26.671
How you kicked the crap
out of those guys.

23:27.540 --> 23:30.236
- No offense, but you're kind of...
- Wiry?

23:30.410 --> 23:33.277
Heh, exactly. So?

23:34.280 --> 23:36.271
I just watch a lot of Bruce Lee movies.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.408
<i>You say you got no faith
In things that you can't see</i>

23:40.587 --> 23:43.181
- You thirsty?
- Sure.

23:43.356 --> 23:47.383
<i>I'm sorry I ain't there with you
But you ain't here with me</i>

23:47.560 --> 23:49.425
<i>And I'm down in all my fears</i>

23:49.596 --> 23:52.861
- So you live around here?
- No. Not really.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.397
It's a cool song.

23:54.567 --> 23:58.799
My dad doesn't listen
to anything recorded after 1979, so...

23:59.873 --> 24:03.070
- Does that mean you can't?
- I'm kind of stuck in the car a lot.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.769
My dad has to travel. For work.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.469
Me and my mom bounce around too.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.046
She's all about,
"Letting the wind be our guide."

24:10.216 --> 24:11.649
Like a hippie?

24:11.818 --> 24:13.251
Minus the peace and love.

24:21.427 --> 24:25.090
We're always on the road. I've seen
the world's biggest ball of twine twice.

24:25.265 --> 24:26.664
Heh, three times.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.061
- Not that big.
- Right?

24:29.602 --> 24:31.900
Okay, but be honest,
moving all the time sucks.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.595
You're always the new kid...

24:33.773 --> 24:36.833
...and everyone always thinks
you're a freak.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.270
Sam, you are a freak.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.447
But so was...
I don't know, Jimi Hendrix...

24:42.615 --> 24:44.947
...and Picasso.

24:45.485 --> 24:46.713
So am I.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.819
All the coolest people are freaks.

24:56.796 --> 24:57.990
<i>Sam...</i>

24:58.164 --> 24:59.290
...what I am...

24:59.465 --> 25:00.796
...I'm managing it.

25:00.967 --> 25:03.697
You spiked three guys this week.

25:03.870 --> 25:06.100
No. You don't understand.
It's not like that.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.263
I'm not just some murderer.

25:08.441 --> 25:10.602
- I had to.
- Why?

25:12.312 --> 25:13.973
I can't...

25:15.281 --> 25:16.339
I just had to.

25:17.450 --> 25:20.180
Please believe me, Sam.

25:22.388 --> 25:23.480
I can't.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.055
I'm sorry.

25:25.258 --> 25:26.452
So am I.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.906
This is the one he asked to see.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.808
Great. Great. Uh, let me ask you,
did he do anything to it?

25:53.486 --> 25:55.920
He just asked a few questions
about the other vics.

25:56.089 --> 25:58.853
Missing pituitary glands and so forth.

26:00.293 --> 26:01.521
Son of a bitch.

26:03.997 --> 26:05.521
Sam is chasing a what?

26:05.698 --> 26:06.824
A Kitsune.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.434
It's pretty rare.
Dad and I hunted one back in '98.

26:09.936 --> 26:13.030
- Vaguely rings a bell.
- Yeah. Didn't make our highlight reel.

26:13.206 --> 26:15.504
<i>Well, at least now we know
he's working a job.</i>

26:15.675 --> 26:18.166
<i>- Yeah, but why pull the Houdini act?
- Not a clue.</i>

26:18.344 --> 26:20.608
What are you gonna do
when you catch up?

26:21.214 --> 26:23.375
I got a few ideas.

26:36.029 --> 26:37.189
How did you find me?

26:39.265 --> 26:40.357
You dropped this.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.562
Amy Pond, huh? Cute name.

26:48.241 --> 26:50.641
- Weren't kidding about the mortgage.
- Sam...

26:52.345 --> 26:53.972
Wait, that's fresh.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.711
That's not mine.

26:57.884 --> 26:59.818
- You killed again.
- You think I want to?

26:59.986 --> 27:02.580
Tell me what you're doing
or I have to kill you...

27:02.755 --> 27:04.655
...whether I want to or not.
I can't.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.885
- Sam, you know me.
- No, I knew you.

27:08.061 --> 27:10.461
- But that was a long time ago.
- No. You know me.

27:12.465 --> 27:14.660
You know the kind of person I am.

27:22.675 --> 27:25.439
- Crap.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to.

27:25.611 --> 27:28.171
It's just...
If she sees it, my mom will be so pissed.

27:28.381 --> 27:29.848
Yeah. It was just an accident.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.576
Yeah, well, she has a temper.
Uh, sometimes.

27:32.752 --> 27:33.946
It's no big deal.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.849
My dad does too.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.388
You don't wanna see him
when he's drinking.

27:41.594 --> 27:44.927
My mom,
I don't think she's a good person.

27:46.399 --> 27:48.697
Sometimes I don't think
I'm a good person either.

27:48.901 --> 27:51.096
- You are.
- Don't be so sure.

27:52.972 --> 27:54.837
I've been around enough bad...

27:55.007 --> 27:57.635
...to know good when I see it.

28:01.147 --> 28:04.913
It's just she has this whole plan for me
but...

28:05.218 --> 28:08.551
- I don't wanna be like her.
- I don't wanna be like my dad either.

28:10.723 --> 28:11.815
All right.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.459
Then tell me what's going on.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.961
- Drop the knife, I'll show you.
- Show me and I'll drop the knife.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.868
Don't move.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.809
This is Jacob...

28:40.052 --> 28:41.144
...my son.

28:46.592 --> 28:49.083
I've built a life here, Sam.

28:49.262 --> 28:51.890
I'm in the PTA. I'm boring.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.191
- But you're still feeding.
- On the dead.

28:55.334 --> 28:56.596
I'm a mortician.

28:59.205 --> 29:02.003
I know, not sexy...

29:02.175 --> 29:03.540
...but health benefits.

29:05.278 --> 29:08.577
I quietly take what Jacob and I need.
No one gets hurt.

29:09.382 --> 29:11.543
But it can be risky...

29:11.717 --> 29:13.912
...feeding like that,
especially for a kid.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.015
Jacob got sick.

29:17.190 --> 29:20.250
He was dying,
and the only way to fight it off was...

29:20.426 --> 29:21.620
He needed fresh meat.

29:21.794 --> 29:23.125
It worked.

29:23.296 --> 29:25.127
After the last one, his fever broke.

29:25.298 --> 29:26.629
- Amy...
- It's over.

29:26.799 --> 29:29.632
- You can't guarantee that.
- I give you my word.

29:30.136 --> 29:33.697
So how is spilling more blood
gonna help anyone?

29:35.107 --> 29:37.302
You could still walk away from this.

29:38.711 --> 29:40.702
We both can.

29:42.748 --> 29:44.079
Sam.

29:44.617 --> 29:46.414
After what I did for you.

29:49.055 --> 29:50.249
- Amy, l...
- Hide.

29:50.423 --> 29:52.050
- What?
- Quick.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.429
- Hey.
- They caught up.

29:58.331 --> 29:59.389
Who caught up?

29:59.565 --> 30:01.533
Couple of pros in a piece of crap Impala.

30:05.972 --> 30:07.166
- We're leaving.
- Mom...

30:08.040 --> 30:10.941
I'm only gonna say this once.
I put the food on this table.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.635
You'll do as you're told
or I will let you starve.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.804
Okay.

30:18.084 --> 30:19.415
Gas up the van. I'll pack.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.990
Good girl.

30:37.803 --> 30:39.634
Awesome first date, huh?

30:39.972 --> 30:42.566
Look,
I'm sorry you gotta go like this, but...

30:43.709 --> 30:44.801
What's wrong?

30:46.078 --> 30:47.443
Look, I know my mom is...

30:47.613 --> 30:49.672
No, I just have to go. I'm sorry.

30:56.155 --> 30:57.588
Oh, that's nothing. That's just...

30:58.591 --> 31:00.855
- Sam?
- It's my dad and brother in the Impala.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.893
You're a monster.

31:05.631 --> 31:06.689
You're a hunter.

31:08.701 --> 31:12.603
So you're supposed to kill me
and I'm supposed to kill you?

31:17.043 --> 31:18.135
I guess.

31:19.612 --> 31:21.671
Sam, I've never killed anyone.

31:22.515 --> 31:24.415
And I don't wanna hurt you.

31:26.152 --> 31:27.551
Do you wanna hurt me?

31:31.557 --> 31:32.649
No.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.558
Then run.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.856
If my mom finds you, she'll kill you.
Run.

31:40.166 --> 31:41.258
Please, Sam.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.509
Howdy, Sam.

32:05.891 --> 32:08.451
New rule.
You steal my baby, you get punched.

32:08.661 --> 32:10.458
The hell, Sam, running off like that?

32:10.663 --> 32:12.528
Satan could've been
calling your plays.

32:12.698 --> 32:16.031
Dean, look,
how many times do I have to tell you?

32:16.202 --> 32:19.171
- I'm fine.
- Yeah. A poster boy for mental health.

32:19.939 --> 32:22.567
Any idea the kind of
horror shows I had in my head?

32:22.742 --> 32:24.403
Dean, I left you a note.

32:24.577 --> 32:27.273
- There was a job in town.
- A Kitsune.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.471
Yeah, yeah. No, I know.

32:29.682 --> 32:32.583
And you ignore Bobby and I's
phone calls, why exactly?

32:32.752 --> 32:34.947
I wanted to take care of it. And I did.

32:35.121 --> 32:36.645
- I took care of it.
- Really?

32:36.822 --> 32:38.380
Yes.

32:38.557 --> 32:40.388
Where's the body?

32:46.599 --> 32:47.827
There is no body.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.126
Why not?

32:51.137 --> 32:53.162
Because I let her go.

32:53.339 --> 32:54.601
She's gone.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.000
You what?

32:56.942 --> 32:58.466
Why?

33:01.080 --> 33:02.308
Sam!

33:02.481 --> 33:04.847
I knew you were hiding something.

33:05.017 --> 33:08.111
See, we can never blow town
without Amy throwing a bitch fit.

33:09.121 --> 33:11.646
So agreeing to go peacefully.

33:12.091 --> 33:14.116
Well, who is this?

33:14.293 --> 33:16.090
- He's my friend.
- No, he's not.

33:16.262 --> 33:17.661
- Sam...
- Shut up!

33:18.097 --> 33:19.587
What is wrong with you, huh?

33:20.166 --> 33:22.430
You that stupid? Really?

33:22.601 --> 33:25.502
I already told you
you cannot have friends.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.161
- This kid is food!
- No!

33:30.943 --> 33:33.002
This will teach you.

33:58.037 --> 34:00.062
You never told me that.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.171
I never told anyone.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.004
I mean, can you imagine
what Dad would have done?

34:07.880 --> 34:10.815
So you saw the article in the newspaper
and you just bolted.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.081
It was my mess.

34:13.284 --> 34:15.844
And you call letting her go
cleaning it up?

34:16.822 --> 34:20.815
She killed her own mom, Dean.
To save me.

34:21.327 --> 34:23.659
I hear you, Sam. I do.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.328
But look at her now.

34:26.699 --> 34:30.533
She's dropping bodies, man.
Which means we gotta drop her...

34:30.703 --> 34:34.605
...no matter how many merit badges
she racked up when she was a kid.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.866
I'm sorry, but it's that simple.

34:39.545 --> 34:42.571
Nothing in our lives is simple.

34:44.350 --> 34:45.408
<i>You have to run.</i>

34:49.420 --> 34:52.014
Amy. Do you have cash?

34:53.826 --> 34:55.726
I want you on the first bus
out of town.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.056
- Tonight.
- What about...?

34:58.230 --> 34:59.857
I'll take care of her.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.390
Just go.

35:02.568 --> 35:03.626
Come with me.

35:05.337 --> 35:08.898
We don't have to be alone.
We can be freaks together, Sam.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.868
Sam.

35:11.577 --> 35:12.635
I can't.

35:14.880 --> 35:15.938
I'm sorry.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.541
So am I.

35:23.289 --> 35:25.154
Look, man, I get it, okay?

35:25.357 --> 35:29.054
You meet a girl, you feel that spark.
There's nothing better. But this freak?

35:33.365 --> 35:34.593
- I didn't mean...
- You did.

35:36.302 --> 35:37.735
I see the way you look at me.

35:37.903 --> 35:40.997
Like I'm a grenade,
and you're waiting for me to go off.

35:41.173 --> 35:43.471
- Sam...
- I'm not going off.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.634
Look, I might be a freak,
but that's not the same as dangerous.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.110
- I didn't say...
- It's okay.

35:49.381 --> 35:50.439
Say it.

35:53.285 --> 35:56.448
I've spent a lot of my life
trying to be normal...

35:57.089 --> 35:58.647
...but come on...

35:58.824 --> 36:01.657
...I'm not normal.
Look at all the crap I've done.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.591
Look at me now. I'm a grade-A freak.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.321
But I'm managing it.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.863
And so is Amy.

36:08.033 --> 36:09.830
Is she? How?

36:10.002 --> 36:14.166
She works at a damn funeral home
so she doesn't have to kill anyone, Dean.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.831
- She's figured out how to deal.
- Explain the bodies.

36:17.676 --> 36:18.768
She's done.

36:20.446 --> 36:22.505
Her friggin' kid was dying, Dean.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.980
Put you or me in her position,
we'd probably do the same thing.

36:26.785 --> 36:29.117
Look, you don't trust her...

36:29.622 --> 36:31.055
...fine.

36:31.223 --> 36:32.315
Trust me.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.324
Dean, please.

36:41.800 --> 36:42.858
Okay.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.231
Seriously?

36:46.872 --> 36:48.669
Gotta start sometime, right?

36:56.715 --> 36:58.307
Bozeman. Right.

36:59.151 --> 37:02.917
Got it. Thanks. That was Bobby.
We'll hole up in Spokane tonight.

37:03.088 --> 37:05.318
We'll meet him tomorrow.
Why don't you drive?

37:06.659 --> 37:09.492
Heh. You gonna punch me again?

37:31.984 --> 37:35.283
Hey, why don't, uh... Why don't you
check us in? I gotta hit the candy store.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.387
Doctor's orders.

37:58.210 --> 38:01.043
Next time you run,
you should change your license plates.

38:01.213 --> 38:04.148
Keeping the same tags
makes you easy to track.

38:05.417 --> 38:07.146
- Who, uh...?
- I'm Sam's brother.

38:07.319 --> 38:09.913
And you are Amy Pond...

38:10.089 --> 38:12.284
...the Bozeman mortician
who went missing.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.449
There's people looking for you.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.821
- Sam sent you?
- Sam doesn't know I'm here.

38:17.029 --> 38:19.156
But he told you. My son...

38:19.331 --> 38:20.730
I know.

38:21.266 --> 38:22.631
I know.

38:24.169 --> 38:25.659
But people...

38:25.838 --> 38:27.965
...they are who they are.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.234
No matter how hard you try...

38:30.976 --> 38:33.308
...you are what you are.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.613
You will kill again.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.744
I won't. I swear.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.248
Trust me, I'm an expert.

38:41.420 --> 38:44.253
Maybe in a year, maybe 10.

38:45.057 --> 38:47.617
But eventually,
the other shoe will drop.

38:49.061 --> 38:50.153
It always does.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.766
I'm sorry.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.594
You got someone you can go to?

39:28.600 --> 39:30.465
You ever kill anyone?

39:32.805 --> 39:35.330
Well, if you do, I'll come back for you.

39:36.341 --> 39:39.367
The only person I'm gonna kill is you.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.518
Well, look me up in a few years.

39:48.754 --> 39:50.244
Assuming I live that long.

40:07.840 --> 40:11.003
Yes, sir.
Sam Winchester was definitely here.

40:11.176 --> 40:12.234
Yes.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.336
Every alias we have for them.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.939
And I'll find out
where they went from here.

40:17.149 --> 40:19.379
I'm only a couple of days
behind them.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.946
Just grabbing a bite first.

40:27.893 --> 40:30.020
Do you know what I find?

40:31.463 --> 40:33.454
Plain old people taste fine...

40:34.399 --> 40:37.527
...but everything is better...

40:37.936 --> 40:39.403
...with cheese.
