A hundred bucks says
he'll be back inside

02:07.361 --> 02:08.663
before the end of the month.

02:09.897 --> 02:12.634
I don't know how you could be
so insensitive, Julius.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.636
He has problems.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.505
That need to be dealt with

02:17.639 --> 02:19.774
within the framework
of an institution.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.342
Well, that's
a psychiatrist's solution

02:22.476 --> 02:23.678
to everything, isn't it?

02:24.946 --> 02:26.014
Lock him up?

02:26.146 --> 02:27.949
It's my professional opinion,

02:28.082 --> 02:30.250
which I still can't believe
the court ignored.

02:32.252 --> 02:34.287
Nobody ignored you, Julius.

02:35.422 --> 02:37.257
They just didn't agree with you.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.294
Look, Oliver needs
our support.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.898
His mother isolated him
from the outside world

02:44.032 --> 02:45.198
from the time he was born.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.668
So I find it hardly surprising

02:46.801 --> 02:48.435
that he wouldn't feel
a little lost

02:48.569 --> 02:50.404
when she had her accident.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.740
I just hope he finds a friend.

02:53.775 --> 02:56.811
Fifty bucks says
that's never gonna happen.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.681
God, you are unbelievable,
you know that?

03:05.053 --> 03:06.253
Ten bucks.

03:08.388 --> 03:09.657

03:56.037 --> 04:00.174
Oh. Hello Mr. Carter,
Miss Seale.

04:00.307 --> 04:01.843
May we come in?

04:01.976 --> 04:03.811
Could you
come back tomorrow?

04:05.046 --> 04:06.681
My mother's favorite soap is on.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.381
Looks like
she's gonna miss it.

04:09.349 --> 04:10.985
That's why I have to watch it.

04:11.119 --> 04:13.054
Um, we were
just coming by to...

04:13.187 --> 04:14.622
check up on your goldfish.

04:15.223 --> 04:16.591
Is he okay?

04:16.724 --> 04:19.459
Bruce is resting
right now.

04:31.506 --> 04:34.842
Oliver, you like
living here, don't you?

04:34.976 --> 04:35.977
In your old house?

04:36.476 --> 04:38.579
Yeah.

04:38.713 --> 04:41.816
And you don't wanna go back
to the psychiatric home?

04:41.949 --> 04:45.853
Remember, next week
that becomes a reality.

04:45.987 --> 04:49.190
So we're gonna have to prove
to the court that you fit in,

04:49.322 --> 04:51.859
and the best way to do that...

04:51.993 --> 04:54.629
...and maybe the only way
to do that

04:55.395 --> 04:56.831
in the next seven days...

04:58.866 --> 05:00.400
...is to make some friends.

05:02.270 --> 05:04.939
How? What do I say?

05:07.175 --> 05:09.476
Making friends is easy, Oliver.

05:10.443 --> 05:11.979
Just be natural.

05:13.181 --> 05:14.615
Be truthful.

05:16.349 --> 05:17.718
Be you.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.703
I'd say you just fucked up
his life forever.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.150
I hope you
enjoy your flight, sir.

06:23.284 --> 06:24.685
Thank you for flying with us.

06:41.035 --> 06:42.937
<i>Oliver, you like</i>

07:05.458 --> 07:06.394
Hi.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.195
Hey.

07:08.329 --> 07:09.263
Do you mind?

07:09.397 --> 07:10.331
Sure.

07:10.463 --> 07:12.066
I was just about to leave, so...

07:18.539 --> 07:19.941
You're a freak!

07:20.074 --> 07:21.809
Thank you!

07:21.943 --> 07:24.712
What a fucking asshole!
Why did he say that?

07:24.845 --> 07:26.479
He was just being sociable.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.185
You're... you're weird.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.654
Thanks.

07:33.788 --> 07:38.092
I'm... new here.
Um, I'll see you around.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.327
Around?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.395
Usually, I stay inside
a lot.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.030
I like to watch television.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.867
My dad, yeah,
he works at the factory.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.303
What does yours do?

07:49.437 --> 07:52.273
Not much. He's dead
at the moment.

07:52.406 --> 07:53.607
Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:55.176 --> 07:56.177
What about your mom?

07:57.979 --> 08:01.349
She had an accident... sort of.

08:01.481 --> 08:05.753
Oh... that's terrible. Wow.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.254
Can I ask what happened?

08:08.456 --> 08:09.657
Well...

08:10.624 --> 08:12.326
It was about a year ago.

08:12.460 --> 08:15.129
<i>It was a beautiful day</i>
<i>and we were in the back garden.</i>

08:15.963 --> 08:16.964
Oliver,

08:17.098 --> 08:18.498
will you light me
another cigarette?

08:18.632 --> 08:19.934
My hands are all wet.

08:21.302 --> 08:22.636
Sure, Mom.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.152
You're so sweet to me.

08:40.421 --> 08:41.622
Mom,...

08:42.390 --> 08:43.524
...I was thinking maybe,

08:43.657 --> 08:45.192
sometime next week
or next month,

08:45.326 --> 08:46.794
we could go on a trip.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.230
You've been doing so well
in your study, sweetie.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.332
You deserve a special treat.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.168
I was thinking
that maybe we could...

08:54.301 --> 08:56.604
go some place
where they have other kids.

08:57.405 --> 08:59.106
I don't think that's very...

09:00.641 --> 09:02.910
We'll see, closer to the time.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.715
Oh, would you grab my glasses?

09:07.848 --> 09:09.683
I can't see the screen
very well.

09:11.485 --> 09:14.388
Can I get the new camera?
I wanna take a picture.

09:14.523 --> 09:16.557
Of course you can, sweetie.

09:23.197 --> 09:27.068
Okay, okay, wait.
Ready? Smile.

10:06.307 --> 10:08.976
So, how's your mother?

10:11.312 --> 10:12.313
I gotta go.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.635
She came into the house,

10:34.768 --> 10:39.140
and they just kissed and kissed
and kissed, and then it ended.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.978
It's off tonight, so...

10:44.111 --> 10:45.346
tomorrow I'll bring you
up to date

10:45.479 --> 10:46.881
with how he's getting along
on Earth.

10:50.651 --> 10:51.852
I, uh,...

10:54.655 --> 10:56.290
I nearly made a friend today,
Mom...

10:57.958 --> 10:59.293
...but she ran off.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.999
I hope I can see her again
one day.

11:10.137 --> 11:13.174
Isn't that
your next door neighbor?

11:13.307 --> 11:15.809
Shame he can't find
the words for the gravestone.

11:16.277 --> 11:17.612
He's a good kid.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.649
Yeah, yeah.
He's our kind of people.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.051
Burrito?

11:24.185 --> 11:25.186
Burrito.

11:28.989 --> 11:33.260
I mean, you know me,
pick and choose at this point.

11:33.394 --> 11:36.063
You should have kissed her dude,
should've got her.

11:36.197 --> 11:37.831
Hey, guys.

11:37.965 --> 11:40.067
- What's up, buddy?
- How you doing?

11:40.201 --> 11:42.102
Is he coming in here?

11:42.236 --> 11:45.372
Uh, listen to me,
if he actually does...

11:45.507 --> 11:46.707
Definitely coming in.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.543
Guys, guys, guys, guys...

11:48.677 --> 11:50.244
- Hi.
- Hi! Yay.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.981
How's it going? You wanna
come sit with us? Oh!

11:54.114 --> 11:58.219
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.
Get that shit up.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.323
What a loser, man.
Go cry to your mommy.

12:02.456 --> 12:04.391
Look at him,
do you see his jeans?

12:04.526 --> 12:05.859
He's a loser.

12:33.287 --> 12:35.055
<i>...fanna, fanna, fo, fesident,</i>

12:48.402 --> 12:49.638

13:13.327 --> 13:16.897
Come on, Oliver,
just make it up.

13:17.031 --> 13:19.300
Mom needs to know
what happened on the TV.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.504
Alf was fantastic last night.

13:24.138 --> 13:26.508
He makes Brian this model
of the solar system,

13:27.341 --> 13:28.510
which he takes to school.

13:29.343 --> 13:30.545
- Hiya.
- And...

13:34.749 --> 13:35.684
Hiya.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.117
Hi.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.053
We buried her, you know.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.088
Thank you very much.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.222
Ah.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.391
It's our job.

13:46.561 --> 13:48.362
I haven't seen any dogs
around here.

13:49.764 --> 13:52.166
Oh, yeah. We just got him.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.735
-For security.
-Yeah.

13:53.867 --> 13:57.037
But he was being a real
bad doggy this morning, so...

14:03.877 --> 14:06.146
Yeah, had to leave him at home.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.550
And Casey savaged
the Warners.

14:10.351 --> 14:12.554
You know, we don't just
dig graves.

14:12.687 --> 14:13.788
We run tours of the place.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.155
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

14:15.289 --> 14:16.758
We tell the stories
of all the people

14:16.890 --> 14:20.194
who, uh, you know, live here.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.129
Well, that sounds
very interesting.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.897
You should tag along one day,

14:24.632 --> 14:26.033
free of charge.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.636
Thank you, but I'm a little busy
at the moment.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.071
You see...

14:31.905 --> 14:33.374
I'm looking for a friend.

14:36.811 --> 14:38.078
A noble quest.

14:41.115 --> 14:45.285
Search near and far,
high and low.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.594
You got this, man.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.663
What?

14:55.797 --> 14:57.431
- Hey.
- Come on!

14:57.565 --> 14:59.133
- Thanks.
- I'm sorry, I,

14:59.266 --> 15:00.334
- I thought you...
- It's okay.

15:02.737 --> 15:03.671
What am I saying?

15:03.805 --> 15:05.038
What?

15:05.172 --> 15:06.940
Nope. No, I got you, all right.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.275
See ya.

15:10.879 --> 15:12.881
We are gathered
here today

15:13.013 --> 15:15.382
to witness
the passing of Mitch...

15:15.517 --> 15:16.618
Oh, yeah, so,

15:16.751 --> 15:18.252
the science teacher
obviously hadn't heard

15:18.385 --> 15:20.020
about the two planets
that were past Pluto

15:20.154 --> 15:21.656
called Dave and Alvin.

15:21.790 --> 15:25.025
So I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,...

15:25.159 --> 15:31.833
...I will fear no evil
for you are with me.

15:31.965 --> 15:36.704
Dust to dust, ashes to ashes.

15:37.672 --> 15:39.707
Amen.

15:39.841 --> 15:41.341
Amen.

15:46.915 --> 15:48.850
I told him
going to school in America

15:48.982 --> 15:50.652
was a bad idea.

15:50.785 --> 15:53.120
He should have stayed
in England with me.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.719
Everybody liked Mitch.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.056
He had so many friends.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.293
He was
everybody's friend.

16:48.910 --> 16:52.981
Nah-ah. You know what?
Let's go around the side.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.448
Give him a little surprise.

16:55.449 --> 16:56.450
God.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.362
Oliver?

17:10.230 --> 17:12.432
We were just coming
to check up on you.

17:12.567 --> 17:14.434
Everything's fine.

17:14.569 --> 17:16.470
Any luck finding a friend?

17:16.604 --> 17:19.239
Oh, yeah.

17:19.373 --> 17:20.942
That's marvelous news.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.342
His name's Mitch.

17:22.476 --> 17:23.745
Have you brought him
here yet?

17:23.878 --> 17:25.547
Uh, no.

17:25.680 --> 17:28.917
Oh, you must.
He'll love this place.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.250
Where does he live?

17:30.952 --> 17:32.520
Not that far away.

17:32.654 --> 17:35.790
Well, you should just dig him on
out of there and drag him home.

17:36.824 --> 17:38.125
You really think I should?

17:38.258 --> 17:41.663
Of course, it's a must.
It'll be fun.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.398
Congratulations.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.071
Oh, yeah.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.173
All right, let's get outta here.
Come on.

18:01.649 --> 18:06.119
Just as I suspected,
he is delusional.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.221
You're being ridiculous.

18:08.355 --> 18:11.593
Oliver is about to have
the first taste of life.

20:23.057 --> 20:25.392
Hi, I'm Oliver.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.762
You must be Mitch.

20:30.998 --> 20:32.299
It's kinda cold out here.

20:34.301 --> 20:35.870
Wanna come back to my house?

20:37.538 --> 20:38.740
You'll love it.

20:54.856 --> 20:58.425
I understand if you're
a little nervous about...

20:58.559 --> 20:59.794
getting into the car again

20:59.927 --> 21:01.829
after what happened
last time, but...

21:07.135 --> 21:08.736
I'm a really careful driver.

21:09.937 --> 21:10.938
I promise.

21:13.741 --> 21:14.742
Hi.

21:15.910 --> 21:16.978
Hi.

21:17.111 --> 21:18.378
This is Mitch.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.515
Hello, Mitch.

21:20.648 --> 21:22.049
Mitch is my first friend.

21:24.351 --> 21:25.920
It was good to meet both of you.

21:38.498 --> 21:39.967
I think she liked you.

21:56.851 --> 21:57.785
Home sweet home.

22:42.630 --> 22:43.865
Can I get you anything?

22:46.968 --> 22:48.803
You're so easy to have around.

22:52.974 --> 22:54.642
I met your mother, by the way.

22:55.910 --> 22:56.911
She seemed fine.

22:58.746 --> 23:00.047
She misses you, I think.

23:02.650 --> 23:04.552
Maybe my mother misses me, too.

23:06.687 --> 23:09.590
She had an accident, you know.

23:11.826 --> 23:13.661
It was a beautiful day,...

23:14.762 --> 23:17.598
...and we were sitting
in the back garden.

23:55.169 --> 23:57.204
Here to fix
the television set, sir.

23:57.338 --> 23:58.539
That's great.

24:00.408 --> 24:04.078
This may not be the best time.
Could you come back later?

24:10.885 --> 24:13.154
Cool shades, man.
It just died, huh?

24:13.287 --> 24:15.556
The TV? Yeah, it just died.

24:15.690 --> 24:16.891
They both did.

24:18.893 --> 24:20.194
Can I get you anything?

24:21.362 --> 24:23.097
-Huh?
-Can I get you anything?

24:23.230 --> 24:25.900
Oh, Cola. Chill.

24:27.735 --> 24:28.936
Sure.

24:31.872 --> 24:33.074
Okay.

24:53.894 --> 24:54.762
<i>There is</i>
<i>no constellation</i>

24:54.895 --> 24:56.397
<i>in visual distance.</i>

24:56.530 --> 24:58.366
<i>No stellar explosion.</i>

24:58.498 --> 24:59.499
Huh, it works.

24:59.633 --> 25:00.901
Put it there, man.

25:04.305 --> 25:05.539
Cheers.

25:07.808 --> 25:09.010
Thank you.

25:21.922 --> 25:23.557
Gotta go. Nice to meet ya,

25:23.691 --> 25:26.027
and your friend.
Take it easy, boys.

25:31.365 --> 25:32.566
You want one?

25:39.173 --> 25:41.510
Could you stop...
could you stop the car?

25:41.642 --> 25:44.111
Oliver! Are you okay?

25:45.679 --> 25:47.048
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

25:48.315 --> 25:49.316
Can I...

25:52.620 --> 25:53.821
What you got?

25:56.957 --> 25:59.093
Oh, that's uh,
that's for Mitch.

25:59.794 --> 26:01.095
He's getting cold.

26:01.862 --> 26:03.864
Sure. Um...

26:04.598 --> 26:05.866
Look,

26:06.000 --> 26:08.235
I, I wanna apologize
about the other day.

26:09.737 --> 26:11.972
Um, I didn't mean to run off,
it was just...

26:12.673 --> 26:15.342
really intense for me.

26:15.476 --> 26:16.677
Um,

26:17.978 --> 26:19.847
I mean it, it must have been...

26:20.614 --> 26:22.183
fucking horrible to see...

26:22.817 --> 26:24.151
something like that...

26:24.285 --> 26:25.520
and...

26:25.653 --> 26:28.189
Yeah, I'm just really,
I'm really sorry about your mom.

26:29.156 --> 26:30.191
Um...

26:34.161 --> 26:35.362
Nothing can replace family.

26:43.003 --> 26:45.106
And then they bump
into this woman, Jody.

26:45.239 --> 26:46.907
Brian's terrified
because he thinks

26:47.041 --> 26:48.909
they're gonna give Alf away
to the alien task force.

26:49.043 --> 26:50.978
Doug, what are you doing
over there?

26:51.112 --> 26:53.247
We're taking a break.

26:53.380 --> 26:56.383
But luckily Jody turns out
to be blind, so...

26:56.518 --> 26:58.686
she just thinks that Alf is
a short and hairy human

26:58.819 --> 27:00.454
and everything's fine.

27:02.356 --> 27:03.891
I, uh...

27:04.024 --> 27:05.726
I really wanted to tell you
about my new friend, Mitch.

27:06.961 --> 27:08.729
He's just like you in some ways.

27:10.297 --> 27:14.201
Uh, listen, I, I've got
a lot of things to do today.

27:14.335 --> 27:16.804
Will you just... will you
just watch my things, okay?

27:23.878 --> 27:25.045
Hi, Doug.

27:25.179 --> 27:26.280
Ooh.

27:26.413 --> 27:28.816
- How is everything?
- Never better.

27:28.949 --> 27:30.885
People have been dropping
like flies.

27:32.019 --> 27:34.021
I did not know that.

27:34.155 --> 27:35.322
There's two big accidents
on the highway

27:35.456 --> 27:37.758
and a botulism epidemic
at the hospital.

27:37.892 --> 27:39.493
The morgue is full to bursting.

27:39.628 --> 27:40.562
We've been working
around the clock

27:40.694 --> 27:42.096
to deal with the backlog.

27:42.229 --> 27:43.831
There's whole families
over there.

27:44.533 --> 27:45.766
Families?

27:47.636 --> 27:49.470
I'll show you.

27:49.604 --> 27:52.206
Oh, before we get
to them, the plane crash...

27:53.774 --> 27:56.310
Uh... Suzanne,

27:56.443 --> 27:58.613
<i>lovely lady. Dead now.</i>

27:58.746 --> 28:00.714
<i>Little Mel, nine,</i>

28:00.848 --> 28:02.883
<i>came from England on a holiday,</i>

28:03.017 --> 28:04.785
<i>choked on a chicken wing.</i>

28:11.892 --> 28:13.794
<i>Ah, Frank.</i>

28:13.928 --> 28:16.730
<i>We're told he was</i>
<i>quite a character.</i>

28:34.448 --> 28:35.716
Cheers!

28:35.849 --> 28:37.184
To being fu-

28:37.318 --> 28:39.019
Yeah.

28:39.153 --> 28:41.989
Well, that sounds bad.
Really does.

29:00.374 --> 29:02.409
We've been told
that you got a big car.

29:02.544 --> 29:03.545
Yeah, and a big house.

29:03.678 --> 29:05.513
All to yourself.

29:05.647 --> 29:06.847
That's right.

29:09.049 --> 29:10.951
Halloween's my favorite holiday.

29:11.085 --> 29:13.988
Blood, death, mutilation...

29:14.121 --> 29:17.458
trick-or-treat,
scaring people shitless.

29:17.592 --> 29:20.494
We were gonna kick it up
the chicken shack like usual...

29:20.629 --> 29:22.530
but this is
a special occasion, right?

29:22.664 --> 29:24.298
So, we wanna switch it up.

29:24.431 --> 29:26.934
We were thinking: big party,
everybody getting drunk,

29:27.067 --> 29:30.304
wrecking things, throwing up,
that type of shit.

29:31.539 --> 29:33.173
And we thought...

29:33.307 --> 29:35.109
you wouldn't mind
if we used your place.

29:35.776 --> 29:36.944
Would I be invited?

29:37.077 --> 29:39.380
Maybe.
We'll think about it.

29:40.180 --> 29:42.316
Well, that's fixed then.

29:42.449 --> 29:43.384
Saturday, at your place.

29:43.518 --> 29:45.386
I, I... I don't know.

29:45.520 --> 29:48.657
-Maybe.
-Hey, we'll be your friends.

29:48.789 --> 29:50.824
Yeah, we'll be his friend.

29:52.594 --> 29:54.795
I don't need friends
like you any more.

30:05.406 --> 30:06.641
<i>Then,</i>
<i>I'll be down on you</i>

30:06.775 --> 30:07.676
<i>like a buzzard on a gut wagon.</i>

30:09.577 --> 30:10.578
I'll get it.

30:20.220 --> 30:21.822
How's your new friend?

30:21.955 --> 30:26.126
Mitch? He's fine, just fine.

30:26.260 --> 30:29.096
Well, we are dying to meet him.

30:29.229 --> 30:30.665
Yeah. And he would say
the same, but...

30:31.432 --> 30:33.768
he's not very well right now.

30:33.901 --> 30:35.336
I thought he was fine?

30:35.469 --> 30:38.839
He's ill,
but our friendship is fine.

30:40.874 --> 30:42.109
You owe me ten bucks.

30:42.242 --> 30:43.611
No, I need proof.

30:44.746 --> 30:45.946
Did you make a bet?

30:47.716 --> 30:50.851
-What was it about?
-Nothing. Nothing important.

30:52.419 --> 30:54.656
I'm so pleased for you, Oliver.

30:54.789 --> 30:56.725
Friendship is a wonderful thing.

30:56.857 --> 30:58.926
Yeah, almost like having family.

30:59.259 --> 31:00.260
Almost?

31:01.362 --> 31:03.964
Well, it's everyone's dream,
right?

31:04.098 --> 31:05.633
To have the perfect family,

31:06.467 --> 31:07.501
just like on TV.

31:08.369 --> 31:09.370
I love TV.

31:10.471 --> 31:11.472
I know you do.

31:15.643 --> 31:17.378
I know
what you're gonna say,

31:17.512 --> 31:19.146
but this is nothing to do
with us being friends.

31:19.279 --> 31:20.948
You gotta believe me.

31:21.081 --> 31:24.051
Just by you being here,
you've saved my life.

31:25.285 --> 31:26.987
I'm happier now that at any time

31:27.121 --> 31:28.989
since my mother had
her accident.

31:33.561 --> 31:36.430
You know, I've never had
a family, Mitch,

31:37.431 --> 31:39.366
not a real one.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.235
My dad, he was always going away
to work some place...

31:41.368 --> 31:43.103
and one day
he just didn't come back.

31:44.271 --> 31:46.508
You know, after that,
Mom got really sad.

31:47.675 --> 31:50.144
All day, she'd sit at home
and watch the television

31:50.978 --> 31:53.213
and drink Martinis and...

31:53.347 --> 31:56.016
Every night I'd hear her crying
on her own in her bedroom.

31:58.218 --> 31:59.153
Then she had
her accident

31:59.286 --> 32:00.588
and they took her away.

32:01.989 --> 32:04.626
They even arrested Ron,
my garden gnome.

32:04.759 --> 32:07.027
And the policeman said he was
gonna get the electric chair

32:07.161 --> 32:09.229
and he thought that was funny,
but I didn't.

32:13.233 --> 32:16.470
After that, they took me
to a psychiatric hospital.

32:16.604 --> 32:19.239
Margot, the social worker, said
I was too old to be adopted,

32:19.373 --> 32:22.342
so I stayed there
until my birthday last month.

32:22.476 --> 32:25.145
That's when the judge said
I could come back home.

32:25.279 --> 32:26.614
He said I'd be happy.

32:27.682 --> 32:31.018
But I wasn't. I was just
all alone here.

32:33.755 --> 32:35.255
You know,

32:35.389 --> 32:37.291
ever since then, I tried to tell
all of this to somebody...

32:37.424 --> 32:39.259
but nobody ever listened
except you.

32:40.762 --> 32:43.063
And that's how I know
you're my friend.

32:48.536 --> 32:50.738
Yeah. This is something
I really have to do, Mitch.

32:54.107 --> 32:55.643
You understand, don't you?

33:49.597 --> 33:52.466
Hi. I'm Oliver.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.234
You're gonna be my new mother.

34:00.675 --> 34:01.809
Get well soon.

34:11.084 --> 34:12.286
Perfect.

34:57.565 --> 35:01.301
Ninja?
You're a girl dog.

35:03.871 --> 35:04.806
Stay.

35:08.643 --> 35:10.277
Hey, hey, you think
any of this stuff is

35:10.410 --> 35:11.980
gonna scare the customers?

35:12.112 --> 35:14.749
You kidding me? In a graveyard
in the dead of night?

35:14.882 --> 35:18.285
All you gotta say is "boo"
and they piss themselves.

35:18.418 --> 35:20.153
They see something like this.

35:25.225 --> 35:26.594
That should give them
a heart attack.

35:26.728 --> 35:29.530
Hey, you nearly gave me
a goddamn heart attack.

35:29.664 --> 35:32.299
You were like "boo"?
And I was like "ah".

35:32.432 --> 35:34.636
Hey Doug, check out
my evil laugh.

35:54.989 --> 35:57.391
-Hi, Elliot.
-Hi, hi.

35:59.727 --> 36:01.729
Jesus...

36:02.630 --> 36:05.099
He looks like I feel, right?

36:06.768 --> 36:08.569
- Hey, Doug! Wait up.
- Come on, buddy.

36:08.703 --> 36:11.606
It's Halloween.
Well, not yet.

It's the one where they take
a family portrait,

36:40.835 --> 36:42.637
so they have something

40:07.074 --> 40:08.509
- Um...
- You've wasted

40:08.643 --> 40:10.811
the best part of the day.

40:10.945 --> 40:13.147
Now, I need you to go get
some things for me...

40:13.281 --> 40:16.284
if you can fit that
into your busy schedule.

40:16.416 --> 40:18.085
I made you up a list.

40:18.219 --> 40:19.620
Oh, and you can go get them

40:19.754 --> 40:22.156
as soon as your daddy's
finished working on the car.

40:22.290 --> 40:23.858
- Dad's working on the car?
- Mm-hm.

40:23.991 --> 40:26.560
And you should go
give him a hand.

40:26.694 --> 40:28.362
Oh, and while you're there,
tell him

40:28.495 --> 40:30.765
that his lunch is almost ready.

40:31.431 --> 40:33.701
Oh. Hi, sis.

40:33.834 --> 40:35.937
You look terrible.

40:36.070 --> 40:38.339
I bet you slept
in your clothes again.

40:38.471 --> 40:39.874
I'm going to have a shower.

40:40.007 --> 40:42.109
Well, tell your friend, Mitch,
to have one, too.

40:42.243 --> 40:44.111
He smells worse than Dad.

40:44.245 --> 40:47.214
Now, now children, no arguments.

40:47.348 --> 40:49.083
He was the one that was arguing.

40:49.216 --> 40:50.151
No, I was not.

40:50.284 --> 40:51.585
Well, you are now.

40:51.719 --> 40:54.522
Come on, you gotta go.
Let's go. Thank you.

41:07.101 --> 41:08.202
There he is.

41:09.236 --> 41:10.571
What are you doing?

41:10.705 --> 41:12.673
What's it look like?

41:12.807 --> 41:14.875
I'm soaking up
these glorious rays.

41:19.479 --> 41:22.083
You know, if you stay out here,
you're gonna catch pneumonia.

41:23.718 --> 41:26.420
Yeah, yeah. And then,
and then I might die.

41:27.888 --> 41:29.323
Aren't those my sunglasses?

41:29.457 --> 41:32.159
Yeah. I'm, uh, I'm borrowing
them if that's alright?

41:32.293 --> 41:34.295
Turns out I need them
more than you do.

41:35.062 --> 41:36.731
Ninja loves an eyelid.

41:42.703 --> 41:45.840
Here, good girl...

41:45.973 --> 41:50.745
Ninja! Come on, it's Oliver,
your owner.

41:52.513 --> 41:54.648
There's a good doggy.

41:54.782 --> 41:56.317
Well trained, you see,

41:56.450 --> 41:59.086
goes straight for the throat.

41:59.220 --> 42:02.857
Come on, son. Help your father
find something.

42:02.990 --> 42:05.659
Sure, Dad.
What are you looking for?

42:05.793 --> 42:07.528
Now, don't tell your mother,

42:07.661 --> 42:10.865
but I lost three fingers
in the transmission.

42:24.912 --> 42:26.680
Well, look at you.

42:35.022 --> 42:36.757
Mom told me to tell you
that lunch is ready.

42:36.891 --> 42:39.860
Good, I'm starved.

42:41.662 --> 42:43.264
Come on, honey, punch.

42:48.436 --> 42:49.970
Come on.

42:54.842 --> 42:57.244
There you go, sweetie-pie.

42:57.378 --> 42:59.246
Oh, thanks honey.

42:59.380 --> 43:01.816
Now, can I fix you
something to eat, Oliver?

43:01.949 --> 43:04.285
No, thank you.
I'm not very hungry.

43:04.418 --> 43:07.121
Darling, is something wrong?

43:11.425 --> 43:14.962
I can't find it.
Oliver and I looked everywhere.

43:15.096 --> 43:19.033
You silly Billy, did you check
behind the seat cushions?

43:19.166 --> 43:21.702
Come on, do I look
like an idiot?

43:24.506 --> 43:27.475
I'll check again, just in case.

43:27.608 --> 43:28.709
Please do.

43:28.843 --> 43:32.146
Don't lose your fingers.

43:38.052 --> 43:39.053
You're gonna take her
on a date?

43:39.186 --> 43:40.921
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

43:42.389 --> 43:44.125
Who is that?

43:47.261 --> 43:48.896
Hey baby,

43:51.098 --> 43:53.067
where have you been
hiding all my life?

43:54.569 --> 43:56.036
Prison.

43:56.170 --> 43:57.506
- I'm new.
- I'm Kurt.

43:57.638 --> 43:59.240
-Hi.
-Captain of the soccer team.

43:59.373 --> 44:02.643
Yeah, now that
Mitch is dead.

44:02.776 --> 44:06.515
So, what do you say
to us going on a date tonight?

44:06.647 --> 44:08.916
What makes you think
that I wanna hang out with you?

44:10.317 --> 44:12.186
-Well, everybody does, huh?
-Oh.

44:12.319 --> 44:14.523
I'm the most popular guy
in Hubris.

44:14.655 --> 44:16.457
Hi. Hey.

44:16.591 --> 44:18.025
-Um...
-You know the weirdo?

44:18.159 --> 44:19.093
-Hi.
-What are you,

44:19.226 --> 44:20.828
what are you doing tonight?

44:21.462 --> 44:22.730
Uh, um...

44:22.863 --> 44:24.231
I thought
maybe we could go out.

44:25.166 --> 44:28.002
-Out?
-Yeah, on a date.

44:45.554 --> 44:47.855
Hi, I'm home.

44:47.988 --> 44:50.391
Huh, oh, can you please
wipe your feet?

44:50.525 --> 44:52.993
I've just vacuumed in here.

44:53.127 --> 44:55.963
- Sorry.
- I need a rest, darling.

44:56.096 --> 44:58.199
Oh, come on
sweetie-pie.

44:58.332 --> 45:03.003
A little exercise never
killed anybody. Hmm, did it?

45:10.177 --> 45:13.847
I don't know what you think
you're doing sitting there,

45:13.981 --> 45:16.717
but you gotta go tidy
your room, make your bed

45:16.850 --> 45:18.385
and take a shower before dinner.

45:18.520 --> 45:20.721
- But Mom...
- Please, go.

45:20.854 --> 45:23.424
Please go. Thank you very much.

45:24.593 --> 45:26.026
Thank you, sweetheart.

45:26.160 --> 45:28.896
Off we go. Can you believe that?

45:29.029 --> 45:32.333
Are we switching? Count me in.

45:49.049 --> 45:52.353
I look fucking sensational.
Do you have a comb?

45:59.326 --> 46:00.729
I think we should go out
and party tonight.

46:00.861 --> 46:02.062
What do you reckon?

46:02.196 --> 46:03.698
I can't, Mitch. I'm sorry.

46:03.831 --> 46:08.269
I've got a date tonight
with Chloe.

46:08.402 --> 46:11.438
Chloe? Who's Chloe?
What's she like? Is she cute?

46:13.173 --> 46:14.141
She's terrifying.

46:21.148 --> 46:22.349
She got a sister?

46:35.764 --> 46:36.997
Strong.

46:41.201 --> 46:43.571
Weak. That's boring.

46:44.371 --> 46:45.372
Something else.

46:50.411 --> 46:51.546
It's better.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.414
Well, I've never been
on a date before, so...

46:53.548 --> 46:55.015
-So?
-What do I do? What do I say?

46:55.149 --> 46:56.551
-I just, I just...
-Chill out,

46:56.685 --> 46:58.787
you're gonna be fine.
I'll talk you through it.

46:58.919 --> 46:59.853
We'll start with the basics.

46:59.987 --> 47:02.356
Boys! Dinner's ready!

47:02.489 --> 47:04.358
Here we go.

47:05.560 --> 47:06.994
Now, later on,

47:07.127 --> 47:08.996
I thought that we should play
a game of charades.

47:09.129 --> 47:10.964
Oh, no. I have to go out
after dinner.

47:11.098 --> 47:12.701
Oh, well you can think again,
young man.

47:12.833 --> 47:15.069
You're not going anywhere
until you wash those dishes...

47:15.202 --> 47:17.137
- But Mom!
- No arguments.

47:19.306 --> 47:21.776
Oh, guests first, darling.

47:21.909 --> 47:24.878
You don't wanna set
a bad example to the children.

47:25.012 --> 47:26.347
-Sorry.
-I'm actually all right.

47:26.480 --> 47:27.615
Thank you though.

47:27.749 --> 47:29.283
I haven't had much
of an appetite these days.

47:29.416 --> 47:31.151
Why don't you
just have one piece?

47:31.285 --> 47:33.621
You'll waste away.

47:33.755 --> 47:34.955
I met this guy once

47:35.089 --> 47:37.625
and the only thing
he ate was cheese.

47:37.759 --> 47:39.960
Yeah, mostly, I think.

47:42.996 --> 47:44.898
I like my cheeses runny.

47:45.899 --> 47:48.869
Brie, ricotta,

47:49.002 --> 47:50.739
cottage cheese,

47:50.871 --> 47:52.574
Camembert,

47:52.707 --> 47:54.274
mozzarella,...

47:59.514 --> 48:00.582
...Danish blue.

48:01.348 --> 48:03.250
Sweetie, I think,...

48:03.384 --> 48:05.620
I think you ate your pizza
too fast.

48:10.692 --> 48:15.028
You know how being a greedy guts
gives you indigestion.

48:15.162 --> 48:16.463
I'm sorry.

48:20.901 --> 48:23.772
Well, look at you.
Nice work, kid.

48:23.904 --> 48:26.240
That deserves a drink. Cheers.

48:27.809 --> 48:29.276
That's my girl.

48:33.715 --> 48:36.383
So, who is she?

48:39.821 --> 48:41.689
The girl that you're
going out with tonight?

48:42.624 --> 48:43.924
How did you know?

48:44.057 --> 48:46.927
I might be dead, Oliver,
but I'm not stupid.

48:48.295 --> 48:50.330
She's just a girl
I met last week.

48:50.464 --> 48:52.933
She's new in town.

48:53.066 --> 48:54.669
Stop it! Ninja!

48:56.303 --> 48:58.506
As long as you remember
to be home before twelve.

48:58.640 --> 49:00.207
Come back here,
you fucking mutt...

49:00.340 --> 49:04.178
Hey, hey, you do not use
profanities in this house.

49:04.311 --> 49:06.313
I'm really sorry, Miss,
it's just... she's got my arm.

49:06.447 --> 49:08.982
What?
Oh my, oh my goodness.

49:09.116 --> 49:11.385
Come here. Come here.
Bring it here.

49:13.822 --> 49:16.990
Oh goodness,
I'm so sorry. Put that back on.

49:17.124 --> 49:18.158
- Thank you.
- Come on.

49:18.292 --> 49:19.661
Let's go. Let's go.

49:20.862 --> 49:22.530
So, you, you were gonna tell me

49:22.664 --> 49:24.566
what I should do and say on,
on this date.

49:24.699 --> 49:26.400
Okay. Just gimme a minute,
'cause I...

49:30.872 --> 49:32.907
I'm really worried, Mitch.

49:33.040 --> 49:35.209
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

49:37.444 --> 49:38.880
You have nothing
to be worried about, all right?

49:39.012 --> 49:40.481
You're gonna have a great time.

49:41.883 --> 49:44.552
There's like three things
that you need to remember.

49:44.686 --> 49:46.153
Firstly,

49:46.286 --> 49:48.121
take 'em somewhere
with a nice view.

49:48.255 --> 49:51.024
Girls love a nice view.
Dunno why.

49:51.593 --> 49:52.594
They just do.

49:53.828 --> 49:55.830
My mom and dad are
always busy.

49:55.964 --> 49:57.431
They hardly ever talk.

49:59.366 --> 50:01.134
They never have fun
together any more.

50:02.504 --> 50:05.874
Sometimes I think
my family's going to pieces.

50:06.006 --> 50:07.274
I know just what you mean.

50:13.548 --> 50:15.382
Should we go somewhere else?

50:16.250 --> 50:20.420
I'm happy just... sitting here,

50:22.022 --> 50:23.558
sitting and talking.

50:39.574 --> 50:40.808
I've never really just...

50:42.109 --> 50:44.111
sat and talked before.

50:45.279 --> 50:47.214
Not even
with your friends?

50:47.347 --> 50:50.050
No, I mean,

50:50.183 --> 50:52.654
I've never really had
any real friends.

50:56.724 --> 50:58.826
Until tonight.

51:05.934 --> 51:07.902
I should be getting back.

51:10.805 --> 51:11.906
I can, I can drive you.

51:12.040 --> 51:13.173
You don't have to.
It's, it's far.

51:13.307 --> 51:15.510
I can, I just call a cab
from your house.

51:16.778 --> 51:17.779
Okay.

51:26.386 --> 51:28.556
Two. Always bring a wingman.

51:28.690 --> 51:31.158
You never know
when you might need him.

51:40.500 --> 51:42.169
How'd it go?

51:43.236 --> 51:44.606
What are you doing?

51:48.910 --> 51:50.143
Hello.

51:51.946 --> 51:53.313
Well, I'm Mitch.

51:53.447 --> 51:57.685
Hi. Uh, I, I just need
to call a cab.

51:57.819 --> 52:00.487
What? That'd be silly.
Ollie could drive you.

52:00.622 --> 52:02.456
But I already offered.

52:02.590 --> 52:03.490
Okay.

52:03.625 --> 52:06.326
What? We insist, come on.

52:06.460 --> 52:08.096
You remember what happened
last time.

52:08.228 --> 52:09.864
I do.

52:10.932 --> 52:12.299
What happened last time?

52:14.702 --> 52:16.037
And then the car's
flipped over,

52:16.169 --> 52:17.404
smashed into a tree

52:17.538 --> 52:18.773
and the whole thing
burst into flames.

52:18.906 --> 52:21.375
Wow. You're lucky
to be alive.

52:21.509 --> 52:23.377
Yes. Yes, I am.

52:25.813 --> 52:28.816
Three. Meet the parents.

52:28.950 --> 52:30.317
How else you're gonna know
what she'll look like

52:30.450 --> 52:31.719
in twenty years?

52:36.758 --> 52:38.258
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

52:38.392 --> 52:40.662
You stay here, okay?

52:48.335 --> 52:50.270
Mom, this is Oliver,

52:50.404 --> 52:52.507
and that's Mitch in the car.

52:53.007 --> 52:54.207
Hello.

52:54.876 --> 52:55.877
Is he all right?

52:57.145 --> 52:58.713
Oliver saved his life.

52:58.846 --> 53:00.515
That was
very nice of you.

53:00.648 --> 53:02.617
And thank you for bringing
my daughter home.

53:02.750 --> 53:03.951
The pleasure was
all mine.

53:06.087 --> 53:08.756
Thank you for a lovely evening.

53:08.890 --> 53:11.291
What
a polite young man.

53:11.425 --> 53:13.528
Chloe, you should kiss him
good night.

53:14.128 --> 53:15.295
Mom.

53:15.429 --> 53:17.330
It was nice to meet you, Oliver.

53:27.340 --> 53:29.110
I had...

53:29.242 --> 53:30.778
I had a great time tonight,

53:32.146 --> 53:33.346
really.

53:54.301 --> 53:57.370
You did that.
You did that.

54:04.879 --> 54:05.880
Alf?

54:10.852 --> 54:14.321
Thanks for all your help, Mitch.
I'm very grateful.

54:14.454 --> 54:15.823
I made it all up.

54:16.858 --> 54:18.860
Surprised it worked
if I'm honest.

54:30.972 --> 54:32.039
Thank you.

54:43.117 --> 54:45.452
That boy, Oliver, is definitely
up to something.

54:46.621 --> 54:48.589
He's making us look like fools.

54:48.723 --> 54:51.358
He's making you
look like a fool, Julius.

54:53.628 --> 54:55.830
By the way, don't you owe me
ten bucks?

54:56.697 --> 54:58.398
I didn't lose the bet yet.

55:01.235 --> 55:02.603
Today, I'm gonna prove that
there's something very strange

55:02.737 --> 55:04.304
happening in that house.

55:08.308 --> 55:09.510
Yeah.

55:22.156 --> 55:23.423
Where have you been?

55:25.793 --> 55:28.095
Got some great stuff.
You're gonna love it.

55:28.863 --> 55:30.698
Someone might've seen you.

55:31.299 --> 55:33.634
So? It's Halloween.

55:36.170 --> 55:37.337
You know this one?

55:42.243 --> 55:43.177
Can you give us a hand?

55:44.679 --> 55:46.647
I'm dying under here.

55:48.816 --> 55:50.450
You know,
you could have been caught.

55:52.153 --> 55:53.386
What would you have done?

55:54.322 --> 55:55.256
Played dead.

55:58.526 --> 56:02.395
Oh, my god.
It's Margot and Julius.

56:02.530 --> 56:04.799
-Okay?
-I've forgotten all about them.

56:05.867 --> 56:08.202
Oh, oh, oh,
you're messing my hair.

56:10.171 --> 56:11.572
If you're my friend,

56:11.706 --> 56:14.609
you're gonna help me. Now.

56:14.742 --> 56:17.278
Ollie, when have I
ever let you down?

56:17.410 --> 56:20.147
No jokes about being dead,
please.

56:38.232 --> 56:39.700
Hello, Oliver.

56:39.834 --> 56:41.501
Hi, Miss Seale, Mr. Carter.

56:41.636 --> 56:43.871
- Can we come in?
- Uh, sure.

56:45.673 --> 56:47.842
This is Mitch, who I've been
telling you about.

56:47.975 --> 56:51.379
Mitch, this is Miss Seale
and Mr. Carter.

56:51.512 --> 56:52.880
Hello.

56:53.748 --> 56:54.982
Pleased to meet you, Mitch.

56:57.251 --> 56:58.653
Are you all right?

56:58.786 --> 57:01.622
Yeah. Oh, it's just
a little accident. I'm fine.

57:03.224 --> 57:04.592
Uh, what happened?

57:05.893 --> 57:07.427
It was a car crash, um...

57:07.561 --> 57:09.397
the wheel of a plane hit my car
and it flipped

57:09.530 --> 57:10.731
and the whole thing burst
into flames

57:10.865 --> 57:12.366
and stuff was everywhere
and Oliver...

57:12.499 --> 57:13.868
actually saved my life.

57:14.001 --> 57:15.435
He's the best friend
I could ever ask for.

57:17.171 --> 57:19.273
Uh, first degree burns
that I've got. That's so cool.

57:19.407 --> 57:20.875
-You can like, touch them.
-Oh, no. I'm, I'm okay.

57:21.008 --> 57:22.310
-Honestly, please...
-Would anyone like, uh,

57:22.442 --> 57:23.978
tea, coffee?

57:25.546 --> 57:27.081
I'll take a tea, Oliver.

57:28.916 --> 57:30.651
-They smell so cool, and they...
-I'd rather not.

57:30.785 --> 57:32.119
You could even touch them.
They're like...

58:20.034 --> 58:21.268
Who are you?

58:21.402 --> 58:23.537
And what do you think
you're doing in my bathroom?

58:23.671 --> 58:25.106
I, I, I didn't know, um,
I didn't know

58:25.239 --> 58:27.174
-anybody was here.
-Don't just stand there,

58:27.308 --> 58:30.544
get out. Stupid little man.

58:33.714 --> 58:35.282
Did you meet my mother?

58:35.416 --> 58:36.784
Yeah, isn't it amazing?

58:36.917 --> 58:38.352
Mitch's parents are staying here
while on vacation

58:38.486 --> 58:40.755
and it seems like Oliver's
having a lot of fun.

58:40.888 --> 58:42.256
Tea and coffee's ready.

58:42.390 --> 58:43.791
We gotta go.

58:43.924 --> 58:45.893
'Cause we got another meeting,
right? And, uh...

58:46.027 --> 58:49.897
Yeah, sorry we didn't get
to stay longer. Um, bye.

58:51.365 --> 58:53.000
I'll, I'll see you
next week, then?

58:57.271 --> 58:58.706
You are very welcome.

59:01.776 --> 59:03.844
The bird feeder is fixed.

59:05.346 --> 59:06.347
Hmm,

59:06.480 --> 59:08.115
you're not wearing any make-up.

59:08.517 --> 59:09.650
So?

59:09.784 --> 59:11.852
You're letting
yourself go, baby.

59:24.598 --> 59:27.401
Easiest money I've ever made.

59:27.536 --> 59:31.305
I found something in the house,
Margot. Something horrible.

59:31.439 --> 59:32.873
What was it?

59:33.007 --> 59:35.342
Hey, baby. Frank, wake up.

59:38.779 --> 59:42.183
You do make me laugh.
Right, breathe in deep.

59:42.316 --> 59:44.752
And...

59:44.885 --> 59:46.253
That hit the spot.

59:47.421 --> 59:48.722
I don't know, okay?

59:48.856 --> 59:50.157
But I'm gonna figure it out,
and when I do,

59:50.291 --> 59:52.059
that kid's gonna spend
the rest of his life...

59:52.193 --> 59:54.628
Would you listen
to yourself, Julius?

59:54.762 --> 59:56.831
You sound like a crazy person.

59:58.499 --> 1:00:00.234
Two coffees.

1:00:00.367 --> 1:00:02.870
I know what you wrote
in your report to the court...

1:00:03.003 --> 1:00:05.906
and I realize that
your professional reputation...

1:00:06.040 --> 1:00:07.341
has taken quite a knock.

1:00:08.577 --> 1:00:12.246
But you have to accept the fact
that you lost the bet.

1:00:12.379 --> 1:00:14.248
This is not about the bet.

1:00:15.282 --> 1:00:16.250
Okay.

1:00:16.383 --> 1:00:18.452
Well, accept the fact
that Oliver...

1:00:18.587 --> 1:00:20.020
is not gonna be
under your control

1:00:20.154 --> 1:00:22.690
at any time
in the foreseeable future.

1:00:25.192 --> 1:00:26.694
Double or nothing?

1:00:27.328 --> 1:00:28.329
Oh, you're on.

1:00:29.897 --> 1:00:31.098
Let's go.

1:00:49.016 --> 1:00:51.085
I'm quitting tomorrow, I swear.

1:00:53.954 --> 1:00:55.422
When I was about fourteen,

1:00:57.892 --> 1:00:59.760
my father gave me a cigar,...

1:01:01.195 --> 1:01:04.932
told me to save it
until the day I became a man.

1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:08.102
Of course I jumped the gun,

1:01:08.235 --> 1:01:10.337
went straight outside,
smoked the whole thing.

1:01:12.439 --> 1:01:14.175
I threw up
for two days straight.

1:01:22.049 --> 1:01:23.851
I think Alf's about to start.

1:01:26.487 --> 1:01:27.855
I can't miss that show.

1:01:30.391 --> 1:01:31.425
Sure you can.

1:01:33.528 --> 1:01:35.229
I'm gonna grab a beer.

1:01:36.897 --> 1:01:38.299
Two spots.

1:01:39.634 --> 1:01:41.001
Yeah, yeah.

1:01:41.135 --> 1:01:42.169
Okay.

1:01:47.775 --> 1:01:49.009
But Dad...

1:01:51.613 --> 1:01:53.380
what will I tell
my mother about?

1:02:02.890 --> 1:02:04.225
Tell her about you.

1:02:22.743 --> 1:02:24.178
Trick-or-treat.

1:02:24.311 --> 1:02:26.780
Hey, Ollie, we're here.

1:02:26.914 --> 1:02:29.850
Trick-or-treat.
Trick-or-treat.

1:02:30.217 --> 1:02:31.252
Sorry?

1:02:31.385 --> 1:02:32.319
It's tradition.

1:02:32.453 --> 1:02:33.988
You give us a treat,

1:02:34.822 --> 1:02:36.857
or we play a trick on you.

1:02:37.626 --> 1:02:39.126
What kind of trick?

1:02:40.227 --> 1:02:43.197
Well, think we'd have
to trash the house,

1:02:43.330 --> 1:02:45.299
break some windows, and then...

1:02:46.133 --> 1:02:47.801
guess, beat you up.

1:02:49.604 --> 1:02:50.804
So, what kinda treat?

1:02:50.938 --> 1:02:52.641
We want cash.

1:02:52.773 --> 1:02:55.175
Say 300 bucks for starters.

1:02:56.176 --> 1:02:58.078
So, what's it to be weirdo,

1:02:58.680 --> 1:03:01.415
trick-or-treat?

1:03:02.182 --> 1:03:03.551
-Trick.
- What the...

1:03:03.685 --> 1:03:05.185
I'm outta here, man.

1:03:11.892 --> 1:03:13.427
You guys are crazy, man.

1:03:32.479 --> 1:03:33.480
Hey.

1:03:42.624 --> 1:03:44.391
Who were those guys?

1:03:45.826 --> 1:03:47.828
It doesn't matter any more.

1:03:50.864 --> 1:03:53.300
You're not on your own, okay?

1:03:54.536 --> 1:03:57.605
Thanks, I think.

1:04:07.448 --> 1:04:08.583
- Hello?
<i>- Hi.</i>

1:04:08.717 --> 1:04:10.284
<i>Is that Chloe's mom?</i>

1:04:10.417 --> 1:04:12.620
It is, yes.
Please, call me Rachel.

1:04:12.754 --> 1:04:15.724
<i>Hi, Rachel. This is Suzanne</i>
<i>of Suzanne and Frank.</i>

1:04:15.856 --> 1:04:17.391
<i>We're looking after Oliver.</i>

1:04:17.525 --> 1:04:18.859
Oliver?

1:04:18.992 --> 1:04:20.394
Oh yes, the lovely young man

1:04:20.528 --> 1:04:22.429
that took Chloe out
the other night.

1:04:22.564 --> 1:04:25.399
<i>Well, we're taking him</i>
<i>to a Halloween party tonight.</i>

1:04:25.533 --> 1:04:27.868
<i>We would love for you all</i>
<i>to join us.</i>

1:04:28.001 --> 1:04:30.270
Halloween party?

1:04:30.404 --> 1:04:33.474
We don't get out
as a family all too often,

1:04:33.608 --> 1:04:37.010
perhaps you and I could visit
the hair salon in town together?

1:04:37.144 --> 1:04:39.514
Oh, we won't be here
too much longer, I'm afraid.

1:04:39.647 --> 1:04:41.181
So, it'd be great
if you could make it

1:04:41.315 --> 1:04:44.218
- to the party.
<i>- Sure. Why not?</i>

1:04:44.351 --> 1:04:46.186
Eight o'clock then.

1:04:46.320 --> 1:04:50.525
No, that's, that's lovely, okay.
Bye, bye-bye, bye, bye, bye.

1:04:55.195 --> 1:04:56.296
Chloe, honey?

1:04:56.430 --> 1:04:58.298
- What?
- We're going out.

1:04:58.432 --> 1:04:59.801
Ugh.

1:04:59.933 --> 1:05:03.103
You better get yourself ready.
We're going out for dinner.

1:05:03.237 --> 1:05:04.639
- Come on.
- We are?

1:05:04.773 --> 1:05:06.039
Yes, we are.

1:05:06.173 --> 1:05:07.509
The undead always go out
to eat on Halloween,

1:05:07.642 --> 1:05:09.977
and I already bought costumes
for everyone.

1:05:11.211 --> 1:05:12.413
Frank.

1:05:13.213 --> 1:05:14.749
Frank!

1:05:14.883 --> 1:05:17.050
Wake up, baby,
and put your arm back on.

1:05:17.184 --> 1:05:20.020
We are going out.

1:05:29.263 --> 1:05:30.532
Don't hurry,
we'll get you some chicken.

1:05:30.665 --> 1:05:32.700
Watch out, life of the party
coming through.

1:05:37.971 --> 1:05:39.239
<i>♪ Ghostbusters! ♪</i>

1:05:50.852 --> 1:05:52.520
I'm gonna have my work
cut out tonight.

1:05:52.654 --> 1:05:54.722
- I like it here.
- Love me a witch.

1:05:54.856 --> 1:05:56.190
Can I grab some food?

1:05:56.323 --> 1:05:57.525
- Oh, yes. Thank you.
- Yeah.

1:06:01.863 --> 1:06:06.200
Dude, that is the grossest mask
I've ever seen.

1:06:07.267 --> 1:06:09.970
I see way worse
at home every day.

1:06:12.841 --> 1:06:17.144
Can I get a, a large bucket
of chicken and fries, please?

1:06:22.049 --> 1:06:24.251
Hey man, nice outfit.

1:06:24.384 --> 1:06:26.688
Yeah? Check this out.

1:06:28.288 --> 1:06:31.693
Two masks? That's so cool.

1:06:31.826 --> 1:06:33.728
Dad, did you...

1:06:34.963 --> 1:06:36.363
Sorry, son.

1:06:44.238 --> 1:06:47.642
You met my mom before
and this is my dad.

1:06:47.775 --> 1:06:49.209
Jack.

1:06:49.343 --> 1:06:52.446
Well, I'm just so glad
you could join us.

1:06:52.580 --> 1:06:54.616
We're so glad
you telephoned to invite us.

1:06:54.749 --> 1:06:56.684
Well, please.
Take a seat. Take a seat.

1:06:57.552 --> 1:06:59.521
Come on, squeeze in.

1:07:09.931 --> 1:07:13.367
Can I get the, um, flappy bird?

1:07:13.500 --> 1:07:15.202
Flappy bird? Sure.

1:07:20.173 --> 1:07:21.576
You look great.

1:07:26.413 --> 1:07:27.549
- Leave it, Kurt.
- I can't believe

1:07:27.682 --> 1:07:30.217
you left me.
What was that about?

1:07:30.350 --> 1:07:32.252
I'm gonna go in there
and fuck them up.

1:07:32.386 --> 1:07:33.621
I'll be right back.

1:07:38.726 --> 1:07:40.427
Get out the way,
Kurt's coming through.

1:07:40.562 --> 1:07:42.396
Move it. Come on, man,
where's your freak at?

1:07:42.530 --> 1:07:44.131
You're a fucking freak.
Look at your fucking...

1:07:44.264 --> 1:07:45.767
Where's your friend at?

1:07:45.900 --> 1:07:47.035
Yeah, where is he?

1:07:47.167 --> 1:07:49.202
Loser.

1:07:51.138 --> 1:07:52.272
- It's okay.
- This is me,

1:07:52.406 --> 1:07:53.775
- I got this one.
- It's okay.

1:07:58.111 --> 1:07:59.346
This is something I have to do.

1:07:59.479 --> 1:08:00.515
Let's see
what you got, Kurt.

1:08:00.648 --> 1:08:01.883
She's just a girl, man.

1:08:02.016 --> 1:08:04.184
You wanna kiss me? Go on.

1:08:04.318 --> 1:08:05.587
Leave her alone.

1:08:05.720 --> 1:08:07.689
What the fuck are you
gonna do about it?

1:08:07.822 --> 1:08:09.456
Whatever I have to.

1:08:09.591 --> 1:08:11.158
Oh yeah, that's a beauty.

1:08:11.291 --> 1:08:12.627
Ollie!

1:08:13.528 --> 1:08:14.829
Oliver, are you okay?

1:08:14.963 --> 1:08:16.229
Ollie, Ollie.

1:08:18.967 --> 1:08:20.367
He's got this.

1:08:20.500 --> 1:08:21.970
What have you done, Kurt?

1:08:22.102 --> 1:08:22.971
- I didn't do anything.
- What the fuck?

1:08:23.103 --> 1:08:24.038
You killed him.

1:08:24.171 --> 1:08:25.439
Hey, shut up.

1:08:25.573 --> 1:08:27.441
I'm gonna get
an ambulance.

1:08:27.575 --> 1:08:30.310
He can't be dead,
I just tapped him.

1:08:33.447 --> 1:08:35.148
What the...

1:08:35.282 --> 1:08:36.751
Now, it's your turn.

1:08:48.963 --> 1:08:51.298
It looks like you've had
a slight accident.

1:08:51.431 --> 1:08:53.768
Oh, oh, no.

1:08:59.540 --> 1:09:01.676
I think it's time
for you to leave, Kurt.

1:09:01.809 --> 1:09:02.543
So do I.

1:09:02.677 --> 1:09:04.311
Let's, let's get outta here.

1:09:05.813 --> 1:09:06.881
Bye!

1:09:11.686 --> 1:09:14.154

Bradley, it's Julius Carter.

1:10:26.527 --> 1:10:29.396
I need an ambulance here ASAP.

1:10:29.530 --> 1:10:31.666
Yes, it's the kid, Oliver.

1:10:31.799 --> 1:10:33.333
He's gone off the deep end.

1:10:34.635 --> 1:10:37.004
Don't worry. I'm, I'm, I'm
at the house right now.

1:10:38.305 --> 1:10:39.473
I know.

1:10:39.607 --> 1:10:40.875
I'll get all the proof I need.

1:10:41.943 --> 1:10:42.944
Yeah.

1:11:08.703 --> 1:11:10.337
Mr. Carter.

1:11:16.077 --> 1:11:18.546
What are you doing
creeping around my house?

1:11:18.679 --> 1:11:22.517
I, uh, I...

1:11:22.650 --> 1:11:25.385
I suggest you get outta here.

1:11:26.721 --> 1:11:28.089
There's some strange
going on over here

1:11:28.222 --> 1:11:30.591
and I'm, I'm gonna get
to the bottom of it, right now.

1:11:30.725 --> 1:11:33.261
If you don't leave,
I'll call the police.

1:11:33.393 --> 1:11:35.730
Oh, please do,
be my guest.

1:11:35.863 --> 1:11:36.864
Boo.

1:11:38.465 --> 1:11:39.667
Hello, Mr. Carter.

1:11:41.068 --> 1:11:42.069
Meet Ninja.

1:11:50.578 --> 1:11:53.380
Who's a good girl?
Yes, you are. Yes, you...

1:11:53.514 --> 1:11:55.983
Would you like a cup of tea,
Mr. Carter?

1:11:57.417 --> 1:12:00.188
Oi, what do you think
you're doing?

1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:03.591
Oh, no,
don't be ridiculous honey,

1:12:04.559 --> 1:12:06.727
this man needs a real drink.

1:12:10.031 --> 1:12:14.501
You, you don't look very well,
Mr. Carter. Mitch?

1:12:14.635 --> 1:12:15.937
- Yeah.
- Turn the lights on.

1:12:21.642 --> 1:12:25.546
Are, are you running a fever?

1:12:44.999 --> 1:12:46.667
Why are you
putting it on me?

1:12:46.801 --> 1:12:48.002
What are you doing?

1:12:48.135 --> 1:12:49.537
Look back there!

1:12:54.942 --> 1:12:59.013
Don't worry, sir. You'll be
perfectly all right with us.

1:13:09.223 --> 1:13:11.759
Lazy bones, lazy bones.

1:13:11.893 --> 1:13:15.529
Get out of bed, you sleepy head.
Lazy bones, lazy bones.

1:13:15.663 --> 1:13:18.733
Leave me alone,
I need to get more sleep.

1:13:21.669 --> 1:13:22.937
Oliver!

1:13:23.070 --> 1:13:24.404
Oh, dear.

1:13:28.809 --> 1:13:30.011
Why did you do that?

1:13:30.144 --> 1:13:32.680
Uh, what happened here?

1:13:33.281 --> 1:13:34.615
He hit me.

1:13:34.749 --> 1:13:36.617
She just fell off my bed.

1:13:36.751 --> 1:13:38.719
I want you two to make up.

1:13:40.254 --> 1:13:41.822
Come on, Oliver.

1:13:43.591 --> 1:13:46.928
-I'm sorry.
-Hmm, now you, young lady.

1:13:48.029 --> 1:13:49.063
Sorry.

1:13:50.031 --> 1:13:52.833
Now, put your sister's head
down.

1:13:55.435 --> 1:13:59.439
Now, we, we've left something
for you on our bed,

1:13:59.573 --> 1:14:00.808
for your mother,

1:14:01.943 --> 1:14:03.044
from us.

1:14:12.286 --> 1:14:14.755
Hmm. Now, young lady,

1:14:16.223 --> 1:14:20.895
now, do you think we should
put you back together again?

1:14:21.562 --> 1:14:23.097
Huh?

1:14:23.230 --> 1:14:24.298
Bet you didn't think of that one
before you started fighting

1:14:24.432 --> 1:14:25.700
with your brother.

1:14:41.882 --> 1:14:43.483
Hi, Oliver!

1:14:56.464 --> 1:14:57.765
Oliver.

1:15:05.973 --> 1:15:06.974
Hey...

1:15:10.044 --> 1:15:13.014
I have some bad news
about Julius.

1:15:14.782 --> 1:15:16.217
He was taken ill last night,

1:15:16.350 --> 1:15:20.554
and... it may be a long time
before he gets better.

1:15:20.688 --> 1:15:22.523
I'm sorry to hear that.

1:15:23.958 --> 1:15:26.027
I'm filing a report today,

1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:28.829
so you won't be seeing
much of us any more...

1:15:30.898 --> 1:15:34.101
...but I'm always here
if you need me, okay?

1:15:39.707 --> 1:15:42.676
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

1:15:58.959 --> 1:16:00.728
Take care of yourself, Oliver.

1:16:07.401 --> 1:16:09.737
Thanks for everything.

1:16:31.725 --> 1:16:32.927
Hi.

1:16:50.411 --> 1:16:53.013
I'm afraid there's
no more stories from TV, Mom.

1:16:55.517 --> 1:16:57.785
I kinda stopped watching it.

1:16:57.918 --> 1:17:00.754
A lot of crazy stuff's
been happening to me.

1:17:01.922 --> 1:17:03.657
Weird stuff...

1:17:05.159 --> 1:17:06.293
but good stuff.

1:17:09.997 --> 1:17:12.066
I don't know what's gonna happen
in the end.

1:17:16.470 --> 1:17:19.640
Anyway, I'm not gonna tell you
about any of that now.

1:17:23.410 --> 1:17:25.746
Today, I just came
to say one thing.

1:17:35.289 --> 1:17:36.290
I miss you, Mom.

1:17:41.762 --> 1:17:43.130
I really miss you.

1:18:03.484 --> 1:18:05.452
<i>My baby's</i>
<i>better than yours.</i>

1:18:05.587 --> 1:18:06.521
No, she's not.

1:18:06.655 --> 1:18:08.255
Your baby can't do this.

1:18:09.490 --> 1:18:12.226
Can she? Or this,
and her hair's not long enough.

1:18:12.359 --> 1:18:14.995
Also, you can't spin it
as fast as I can, watch.

1:18:15.129 --> 1:18:17.398
Need a hand, sweetie?

1:18:17.532 --> 1:18:21.435
I have everything
under control, sugar-pie.

1:18:27.942 --> 1:18:29.410
That's disappointing.

1:18:29.544 --> 1:18:32.514
Oh, no. I'm coming, sweetie.

1:18:32.647 --> 1:18:34.315
What have you done?

1:18:34.448 --> 1:18:36.116
I followed
the instructions.

1:18:36.250 --> 1:18:37.918
I don't think you did
follow the instructions.

1:18:38.052 --> 1:18:40.187
Everything written
on that piece of paper is

1:18:40.321 --> 1:18:42.456
right here.

1:18:42.591 --> 1:18:44.491
Hey, gimme a hand here.

1:19:28.035 --> 1:19:29.236
Mom.

1:19:30.371 --> 1:19:31.372
Dad.

1:19:52.661 --> 1:19:54.995
You gotta get outta here, son.

1:19:55.129 --> 1:19:58.399
This place is gonna fall apart
any second now.

1:20:01.035 --> 1:20:03.304
Oliver! Mitch! You okay?

1:20:03.437 --> 1:20:06.106
I'm fine. I'm fine.
We need to save Ollie.

1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:07.676
- My leg!
- Oliver?

1:20:07.808 --> 1:20:09.476
- Can you get out?
- It's stuck.

1:20:09.611 --> 1:20:11.045
- Okay, okay.
- Don't worry, kid.

1:20:11.178 --> 1:20:13.480
We'll get it off.

1:20:13.615 --> 1:20:17.885
As soon as we lift it, you just
run out the front door, okay?

1:20:18.018 --> 1:20:20.020
I just can't leave you here.

1:20:21.021 --> 1:20:22.456
We're dead, Ollie.

1:20:22.590 --> 1:20:24.058
And in a few minutes,
you're gonna be leaving us.

1:20:24.191 --> 1:20:26.126
Oliver, Oliver,
listen to me.

1:20:26.260 --> 1:20:29.129
You don't need us any more.

1:20:29.564 --> 1:20:31.265
I... I do.

1:20:31.398 --> 1:20:34.068
Look at us. You can see
what's happening to us, but you,

1:20:34.201 --> 1:20:36.970
you got your whole life
ahead of you.

1:20:37.104 --> 1:20:38.872
And if you don't save
yourself now,

1:20:39.006 --> 1:20:40.974
then it would've all been
for nothing.

1:20:41.676 --> 1:20:43.477
So do it, Oliver.

1:20:44.912 --> 1:20:46.146
Come on, Ollie.

1:20:47.381 --> 1:20:48.415
Come on, Ollie.

1:20:58.359 --> 1:21:00.427
Get the fuck
out of here. Go.

1:21:01.395 --> 1:21:04.031
We all love you,
Oliver.

1:21:06.433 --> 1:21:07.569
Even me.

1:21:10.971 --> 1:21:12.540
Love you, pal.

1:21:12.674 --> 1:21:14.241
Will I ever see you again?

1:21:15.844 --> 1:21:17.945
Not for a long time, I hope.

1:21:19.380 --> 1:21:22.983
But we'll be
waiting for you, I promise.

1:21:36.865 --> 1:21:38.065
It's okay.

1:21:45.807 --> 1:21:47.341
Were you on your own?

1:21:49.844 --> 1:21:52.413
