There's no try, there's only do.

Not even that subtle.

Hello. Welcome.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.446
So...

08:07.446 --> 08:08.863
you were saying something

08:07.446 --> 08:08.863
about flirting?

08:08.863 --> 08:11.658
Are you sure you're

08:08.863 --> 08:11.658
ready to listen?

08:11.658 --> 08:13.743
Yes.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.162
I was saying

08:13.743 --> 08:15.162
that I think

08:15.162 --> 08:16.746
Mateo's aide is

08:15.162 --> 08:16.746
flirting with me.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.206
What?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.250
He's supposed to be focused

08:18.206 --> 08:20.250
on helping Mateo,

08:20.250 --> 08:21.876
not on trying to pick up

08:20.250 --> 08:21.876
his mother!

08:21.876 --> 08:25.255
I know, and I'm not quite

08:21.876 --> 08:25.255
sure what to do-- Ooh.

08:27.382 --> 08:28.800
( sighs )

08:28.800 --> 08:30.551
What were we

08:28.800 --> 08:30.551
talking about?

08:31.970 --> 08:34.181
You need to tell

08:31.970 --> 08:34.181
Mateo's aide

08:34.181 --> 08:35.682
absolutely not!

08:35.682 --> 08:38.893
I know. And if it happens again,

08:35.682 --> 08:38.893
I'll shut it down.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.440
You okay, Mom?

08:44.691 --> 08:46.401
Yeah.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.778
I just feel bad

08:46.401 --> 08:48.778
for hurting Bruce.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.322
He's been so great.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.823
But you couldn't marry him.

or the breakup

08:57.620 --> 08:58.955
until the court

08:57.620 --> 08:58.955

08:58.955 --> 09:00.374
I don't want things

08:58.955 --> 09:00.374

ROGELIO:

09:00.374 --> 09:02.959
Can I just say,

09:02.959 --> 09:04.627
I love Bruce so much!

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

so as soon as we agree

09:07.339 --> 09:08.882

09:28.609 --> 09:29.986
And Bruce, too, of course.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.654
Is everything okay

09:29.986 --> 09:31.654
with him, by the way?

09:31.654 --> 09:33.490
Yeah, he's great.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.242
Because he hasn't been

09:33.490 --> 09:35.242
returning my texts.

09:35.242 --> 09:38.870
Oh, well, I'm sure he's just

09:35.242 --> 09:38.870
busy with other cases.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.789
So, what's the next step

09:38.870 --> 09:41.789

Wow, that is looking

so realistic.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.769
Agreed. So realistic.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.021
And you, your charisma

13:36.691 --> 13:38.192
So, listen, we want

13:38.192 --> 13:39.902
to beef up the love story

13:38.192 --> 13:39.902
a little,

13:39.902 --> 13:42.739
add some complications,

13:39.902 --> 13:42.739
maybe a sizzling hot co-star.

13:42.739 --> 13:43.990
Are you cool with that?

13:43.990 --> 13:46.493
The hotter and sexier,

13:43.990 --> 13:46.493
the better!

13:46.493 --> 13:47.910
( laughter )

13:46.493 --> 13:47.910
Great.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.420
RAFAEL:

13:55.418 --> 13:57.420
<i>You have to relax.</i>

13:57.420 --> 13:59.464
I can't. This

13:57.420 --> 13:59.464
is ridiculous.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.091
This is a kids hotel.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.091
You would be surprised

14:02.091 --> 14:04.302
how many divorcée hookups

14:02.091 --> 14:04.302
we have here at happy hour.

14:04.302 --> 14:07.013
Last week, we caught

14:04.302 --> 14:07.013
a couple in the pirate ship.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.348
JANE: Ugh.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.348
RAFAEL: Shoot.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.641
What?

14:09.641 --> 14:11.100
Petra just walked in.

14:12.393 --> 14:15.021
I kinda got a weird

14:12.393 --> 14:15.021
vibe from her earlier

14:15.021 --> 14:17.440
when I went by her office

14:15.021 --> 14:17.440
to go over some stuff.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.949
After what happened last night,

14:23.655 --> 14:26.949
when we... had sex...

14:29.243 --> 14:32.205
...well, I just... I'm worried

14:29.243 --> 14:32.205
she might have feelings for me.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.040
Of course

14:32.205 --> 14:34.040
she has feelings for you.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.916
She was in love

14:34.040 --> 14:35.916
with you for forever.

14:35.916 --> 14:38.294
That's why you shouldn't have

14:35.916 --> 14:38.294
slept with her.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.629
It was incredibly stupid.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.548
Shh.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.550
What are you two doing here?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.550
Nothing.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.177
Just helping Jane get her

14:43.550 --> 14:46.177
flirt on. She's a little rusty.

14:46.177 --> 14:47.846
Here?

14:46.177 --> 14:47.846
It's not a big deal.

14:47.846 --> 14:49.556
This is a kids hotel.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.015
Those guys look single.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.602
Ew.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.602
Seriously?

14:54.602 --> 14:56.062
You should go

14:54.602 --> 14:56.062
to the Fairwick.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.564
It's a total meat market

14:56.062 --> 14:57.564
during happy hour.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.315
Actually, I'm going home.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.315
No, you are not.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.234
Come on. The Fairwick.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.234
Let's go.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.985
Perfect.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.985
I'll join you.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.532
( loud, upbeat music playing )

15:07.532 --> 15:09.409
Okay, what about him?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.952
JANE:

15:09.409 --> 15:11.952
The guy in the tank top?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.952
Are you serious?

15:11.952 --> 15:14.581
He's got a good body,

15:11.952 --> 15:14.581
a handsome face.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.249
Okay, then you date him.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.958
RAFAEL:

15:16.249 --> 15:17.958
Hoodie, 3 o'clock.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.086
Mr. Robot?

15:17.958 --> 15:20.086
Okay, who do you like, then?

15:20.086 --> 15:22.213
It doesn't matter,

15:20.086 --> 15:22.213
because no one's looking.

15:22.213 --> 15:24.674
Because it looks like

15:22.213 --> 15:24.674
you two are together.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.175
Look, we have

15:24.674 --> 15:26.175
to make it clear

15:26.175 --> 15:27.635
that Jane is

15:26.175 --> 15:27.635
the third wheel here.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.136
Come here, Rafael.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.850
Now I'm gonna

15:32.265 --> 15:33.850
put my head here.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.184
Great.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.938
Look over there.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.523
Tall drink of water,

15:38.938 --> 15:40.523
blue shirt, cute,

15:40.523 --> 15:42.609
and he's looking at you.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.318
Turn slowly.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.697
JANE:

15:46.195 --> 15:47.697
He is cute.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.288
Tone it down.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.248
Flirting is like perfume.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.248
A little dab will do.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.793
Well?

16:01.377 --> 16:03.546
( whirring, beeping )

16:09.552 --> 16:11.512

16:13.264 --> 16:14.641
PETRA:

16:13.264 --> 16:14.641
Perfect.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.976
Go. Go.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.397
I can do this.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.447
Mm.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.828
It's nice to see Jane getting

16:31.616 --> 16:34.828
back out there, isn't it?

16:36.120 --> 16:38.331
( whirring, beeping )

16:45.171 --> 16:46.547
( alarm buzzing )

16:46.547 --> 16:50.092
Look, Petra, I want to be

16:46.547 --> 16:50.092
really straightforward.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.720
Uh...

16:52.720 --> 16:55.473
What happened last night

16:52.720 --> 16:55.473
was a mistake.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.391
What?

16:57.391 --> 17:00.895
You're obviously into me.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.063
No, I'm not.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.063
Jane isn't here, okay?

17:03.063 --> 17:04.524
You don't have to be

17:03.063 --> 17:04.524
this close.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.734
And earlier,

17:04.524 --> 17:06.734
when I stopped by your office,

17:06.734 --> 17:10.112
and you moved closer...

17:10.112 --> 17:12.031
Yes, because I didn't want you

17:10.112 --> 17:12.031
reading my e-mails.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.370
And also,

17:17.370 --> 17:18.955
if you must know,

17:17.370 --> 17:18.955
Chuck is across the room,

17:18.955 --> 17:21.081
and I'm trying

17:18.955 --> 17:21.081
to make him jealous.

17:27.254 --> 17:28.840
Oh.

17:27.254 --> 17:28.840
Mm-hmm.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.299
After everything

17:28.840 --> 17:30.299
he did to me,

17:30.299 --> 17:31.885
telling the cops

17:30.299 --> 17:31.885
about the bones,

17:31.885 --> 17:33.720
I want to make him miserable.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.473
So just get over yourself

17:33.720 --> 17:37.473
and play along, okay?

17:50.236 --> 17:52.906
You have a great laugh.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.282
Thank you.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.282
So, Jane Villanueva,

17:55.282 --> 17:56.659
soon-to-be-published author,

17:56.659 --> 17:58.327
why are you

17:56.659 --> 17:58.327
still single?

17:58.327 --> 18:00.621
I thought somebody would have

17:58.327 --> 18:00.621
scooped you up by now.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.665
Oh, um, well,

18:02.665 --> 18:04.584
I was scooped up,

18:02.665 --> 18:04.584
but then my husband died.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.711
(<i> trombone plays "wah-wah"</i> )

18:06.711 --> 18:08.713
No, but, I mean, I'm, like,

18:06.711 --> 18:08.713
almost totally fine.

18:08.713 --> 18:12.383
That was, like, three years ago,

18:08.713 --> 18:12.383
so it's like, pshh!

18:12.383 --> 18:15.177
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

18:12.383 --> 18:15.177
<i>OMG, I can't watch anymore.</i>

18:16.554 --> 18:18.264
PETRA: I think

18:16.554 --> 18:18.264
he's watching. Sell it.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.021
Really?

18:22.476 --> 18:25.021
That's the best you can do?

18:26.480 --> 18:31.903
Oh, Zen Rafael hasn't

18:26.480 --> 18:31.903
forgotten his moves, has he?

18:31.903 --> 18:33.905
No.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.117
He hasn't.

18:41.913 --> 18:43.289
And I am sure

18:43.289 --> 18:45.625
that you haven't

18:43.289 --> 18:45.625
forgotten my moves either.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.545
It's all a blur.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.756
Paris isn't a blur.

18:51.756 --> 18:54.675
No, that's, um...

18:54.675 --> 18:57.386
hard to forget.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.430
I agree.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.183
Especially...

19:03.183 --> 19:04.727
when I...

19:04.727 --> 19:06.437
( whispering indistinctly )

19:06.437 --> 19:07.814
( Petra chuckles )

19:10.775 --> 19:13.987
That seems like a million

19:10.775 --> 19:13.987
years ago in some ways.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.781
And in other ways...

19:16.781 --> 19:18.950
I know.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.415
Damn it,

19:24.747 --> 19:26.415
this isn't working.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.334
He doesn't even care.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.837
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

19:28.334 --> 19:30.837
<i>Wow, that was pretty intense.</i>

19:30.837 --> 19:32.839

<i>Rafael was too.</i>

19:36.300 --> 19:37.885
Why am I even doing this?

19:37.885 --> 19:40.596
I mean, I'm obviously

19:37.885 --> 19:40.596
out of his league. Right?

19:40.596 --> 19:42.598
Honestly, I don't know

19:40.596 --> 19:42.598
what I even saw in him.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.100
I think it was about

19:42.598 --> 19:44.100
self-punishment

19:44.100 --> 19:45.768
more than anything else,

19:44.100 --> 19:45.768
because the truth is

19:45.768 --> 19:47.394
that I was honestly embarrassed

19:45.768 --> 19:47.394
to be seen with him

19:47.394 --> 19:49.563
the entire time we were dating.

what I was thinking.

Trust me,

20:26.767 --> 20:30.437

when you least expect it.

20:30.437 --> 20:32.106
Thanks, Abuela.

that thrill

when you catch him

20:34.274 --> 20:36.485
looking at you.

while you're straightening up

the postcard display...

20:39.697 --> 20:42.158
We're back on Jorge.

20:42.158 --> 20:45.953
...and then he'll ask

20:42.158 --> 20:45.953
if you want to go out,

20:45.953 --> 20:48.706
but you'll never actually

20:45.953 --> 20:48.706
make a plan,

20:48.706 --> 20:51.125
and you'll be left

20:48.706 --> 20:51.125
feeling like an idiot!

20:51.125 --> 20:53.460
Wait, what?

20:51.125 --> 20:53.460
( sighs )

20:53.460 --> 20:56.047
He hasn't mentioned

20:56.047 --> 20:59.092
our date since he asked me out.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.342
( sighs )

21:00.342 --> 21:03.512
Well, he's obviously

21:00.342 --> 21:03.512
just a big talker.

21:03.512 --> 21:04.931
Or he must have

21:03.512 --> 21:04.931
changed his mind.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.473
I find that hard to believe.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.559
But if you're worried,

21:06.473 --> 21:08.559
you should just

21:08.559 --> 21:10.436
talk to Jorge about it.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.438
No. I can't.

21:32.499 --> 21:35.169
since you asked me out

21:32.499 --> 21:35.169
and we haven't made a plan,

21:35.169 --> 21:37.630
so if you've

21:35.169 --> 21:37.630
changed your mind,

21:37.630 --> 21:38.965
just let me know

21:38.965 --> 21:41.259
because I'm an

21:38.965 --> 21:41.259
independent woman,

21:41.259 --> 21:45.721
and I don't need to wait

21:41.259 --> 21:45.721
around for a man.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.809
I haven't changed my mind.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.227
In fact,

21:51.227 --> 21:52.853
it's quite the opposite.

21:52.853 --> 21:56.274
I just can't decide

21:52.853 --> 21:56.274
where to take you.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.611
I want it to be special.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.238
( sighs )

22:03.823 --> 22:06.242
Well, then

22:06.242 --> 22:08.244
take your time...

22:08.244 --> 22:09.870
ROGELIO:

22:08.244 --> 22:09.870
<i>Do you have a second?</i>

22:09.870 --> 22:11.371
I went by your house.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.748
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

22:11.371 --> 22:12.748
<i>Oh, no. Was Bruce home?</i>

22:12.748 --> 22:15.001
...and Bruce wasn't home.

22:12.748 --> 22:15.001
<i>Phew!</i>

22:15.001 --> 22:16.502
But it's weird, Xo,

22:16.502 --> 22:18.337
because I can't get him

22:16.502 --> 22:18.337
to return my calls,

22:18.337 --> 22:20.923
he's barely responding

22:18.337 --> 22:20.923
to my texts.

22:20.923 --> 22:23.676
Tell me, did I do

22:20.923 --> 22:23.676
something to offend him?

22:23.676 --> 22:25.427
Did you forget to say

22:23.676 --> 22:25.427
"God bless you"

22:25.427 --> 22:26.762
after he sneezed?

22:27.763 --> 22:29.849
No, I don't think so.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.391
I'm sure Bruce is just busy.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.560
It's just that

22:31.391 --> 22:33.560
the settlement talks

22:33.560 --> 22:35.646
are coming up, and this silence

22:33.560 --> 22:35.646
is giving me a bad feeling.

22:35.646 --> 22:38.274
Will you ask him? I don't

22:35.646 --> 22:38.274
want to be all needy,

22:38.274 --> 22:42.402
but if something's wrong,

22:38.274 --> 22:42.402
I'd like to know.

22:42.402 --> 22:44.322
DENNIS:

22:42.402 --> 22:44.322
<i>I want to know.</i>

22:44.322 --> 22:45.865
Well, it was okay,

22:45.865 --> 22:48.159
until I told him

22:45.865 --> 22:48.159
I was a widow.

22:48.159 --> 22:49.493
I wouldn't say

22:48.159 --> 22:49.493
he ran away.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.078
Well, he's an idiot then.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.955
Make sure to follow through

22:51.078 --> 22:52.955
with your right hand.

22:52.955 --> 22:54.332
Uh-huh. Got it.

22:54.332 --> 22:56.000
I mean, dating would

22:54.332 --> 22:56.000
be so much easier

22:56.000 --> 22:57.293
if people already knew.

22:57.293 --> 22:58.752
Tell me about it.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.546
What do you mean? One of

22:58.752 --> 23:00.546
the joys of being engaged

23:00.546 --> 23:03.049
is that you don't have

23:00.546 --> 23:03.049
to worry about dating.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.967
Lindsay and I broke up

23:03.049 --> 23:04.967
a few months ago.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.094
What?

23:07.094 --> 23:08.386
Why didn't you mention it?

23:08.386 --> 23:10.306
She cheated on me.

23:10.306 --> 23:12.558
Yeah, so...

23:12.558 --> 23:14.518
didn't want to brag.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.187
Eh, I'm sorry.

23:16.187 --> 23:17.437
You okay?

23:17.437 --> 23:18.772
Yeah.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.358
Better to know now

23:18.772 --> 23:20.358
than later, right?

23:20.358 --> 23:22.651
( sighs ):

23:20.358 --> 23:22.651
Yeah.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.278
Punch through the bag.

23:24.278 --> 23:25.821
Ah!

23:25.821 --> 23:27.740
You know, you might be

23:25.821 --> 23:27.740
better at boxing than I am,

23:27.740 --> 23:29.867
but I would kick your ass at

23:27.740 --> 23:29.867
a story-writing competition.

23:29.867 --> 23:31.160
( laughs )

23:31.160 --> 23:32.370
Not a sport.

23:32.370 --> 23:33.620
Eh...

23:33.620 --> 23:35.455
Mini-golf, I'd crush you.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.791
Yeah?

23:35.455 --> 23:37.791
Yeah.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.501
Oh, not bad.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.006
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

23:41.837 --> 23:44.006
<i>Whoa. Hold on a second.</i>

23:44.006 --> 23:45.258
<i>Are Jane and Dennis...</i>

23:45.258 --> 23:48.219

24:05.152 --> 24:07.738
<i>or this is happening, people.</i>

24:12.659 --> 24:15.162
A vibe?

24:12.659 --> 24:15.162
With you and Dennis?

24:15.162 --> 24:17.998
I think. Maybe.

24:17.998 --> 24:21.043
Then again, I thought Alex

24:17.998 --> 24:21.043
was super into me too, so...

24:21.043 --> 24:23.629
That's why I need you to go

24:21.043 --> 24:23.629
boxing with me next week.

24:23.629 --> 24:26.215
What?

24:23.629 --> 24:26.215
To suss it out. You owe me.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.050
Just text him.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.050
What?

24:28.050 --> 24:30.052
No.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.052
Why?

24:30.052 --> 24:32.012
We don't just text.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.471
That's the point.

24:33.471 --> 24:35.433
He'll either encourage you

24:33.471 --> 24:35.433
or he won't.

24:35.433 --> 24:36.809
But either way,

24:35.433 --> 24:36.809
you'll know.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.518
Mm...

24:38.518 --> 24:40.687
Didn't you just tell your

24:38.518 --> 24:40.687
grandma to be a modern woman?

24:47.278 --> 24:48.570
Oh, that's a nice touch

24:47.278 --> 24:48.570
with the ellipses,

24:48.570 --> 24:50.530
makes it seem super casual.

24:50.530 --> 24:53.242
( gasps ): Oh, my God,

24:50.530 --> 24:53.242
he's writing me back already.

24:56.078 --> 24:59.748
He's probably thinking of a

24:56.078 --> 24:59.748
nice way to tell me to back off.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.501
Oh, my God, he's insulted.

25:03.501 --> 25:05.171
What?

25:03.501 --> 25:05.171
I've actually insulted him.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.381
He's thinking,

25:05.171 --> 25:07.381
"I should just ignore her."

25:17.099 --> 25:19.517
See?

25:19.517 --> 25:21.270
Okay, now just wait

25:19.517 --> 25:21.270
a minute before you...

LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:

25:21.270 --> 25:23.105
<i>Wow. We may have just witnessed</i>

25:23.105 --> 25:25.523
<i>the beginning</i>

You take more pleasure

25:31.155 --> 25:33.324

25:35.242 --> 25:37.953
Okay, so that's it.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.501
Bruce, I just wanted to say,

25:43.501 --> 25:46.212
if it's too hard for you

25:43.501 --> 25:46.212
to represent Rogelio,

25:46.212 --> 25:49.131
you don't have to.

25:49.131 --> 25:51.591
I'm a big boy, Xiomara,

25:49.131 --> 25:51.591
I can handle it.

25:52.759 --> 25:54.552
What?

25:56.554 --> 26:00.017
I just want to make sure that

25:56.554 --> 26:00.017
you're not letting our breakup

26:00.017 --> 26:01.643
get in the way of his case.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.479
What do you mean?

26:03.479 --> 26:05.605
Well, Rogelio says

26:05.605 --> 26:08.442
that you haven't been

26:05.605 --> 26:08.442
returning his texts.

26:08.442 --> 26:11.153
He's starting to get

26:08.442 --> 26:11.153
a little worried.

26:08.442 --> 26:11.153
Hold on.

26:11.153 --> 26:14.365
Are you asking me to be nicer

26:11.153 --> 26:14.365
to the guy that you left me for?

26:14.365 --> 26:16.783
No, I-I'm just...

26:14.365 --> 26:16.783
Because let me assure you,

26:16.783 --> 26:18.618
I am acting

26:16.783 --> 26:18.618
like a professional.

26:18.618 --> 26:21.038
I'm treating Rogelio like

26:18.618 --> 26:21.038
I treat every other client.

26:21.038 --> 26:24.624
No, I don't respond within

26:21.038 --> 26:24.624
ten seconds to his texts.

26:24.624 --> 26:27.627
No, I don't reassure him

26:24.624 --> 26:27.627
and hold his hand

26:27.627 --> 26:29.629
every time

26:27.627 --> 26:29.629
he contacts me.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.840
But I'm doing my job.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.094
You're right. I'm sorry.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.470
I shouldn't have overstepped.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.808
And I shouldn't feel

26:39.765 --> 26:41.808
badly, right?

26:43.436 --> 26:44.895
I am clearly out of

26:43.436 --> 26:44.895
Chuck's league, right?

26:44.895 --> 26:47.147
Then why do I

26:44.895 --> 26:47.147
feel like this?

26:47.147 --> 26:48.899
Like I-I...

26:48.899 --> 26:50.484
like I want to see him?

26:50.484 --> 26:52.652
I know, I know, I know,

26:50.484 --> 26:52.652
you think I still like him.

26:52.652 --> 26:54.321
And maybe I do.

26:54.321 --> 26:55.906
But I don't want to.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.366
Not that it matters.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.159
I mean, the heart wants

26:57.366 --> 26:59.159
what the heart wants.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.036
And the truth is,

26:59.159 --> 27:01.036
I did say

27:01.036 --> 27:02.580
some pretty lousy things to him.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.206
I mean, you can imagine,

27:02.580 --> 27:04.206
you know how I get

27:04.206 --> 27:05.665
when I'm heated.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.665
( chuckles )

27:07.167 --> 27:08.586
I should probably

27:07.167 --> 27:08.586
apologize, right?

27:09.836 --> 27:11.755
Thanks, Krishna.

27:11.755 --> 27:13.215
My pleasure,

27:11.755 --> 27:13.215
Mrs. Solano.

27:15.259 --> 27:16.843
Do you have a boyfriend,

27:15.259 --> 27:16.843
Krishna?

27:16.843 --> 27:18.636
No, I'm gay.

27:18.636 --> 27:20.347
Gotcha.

27:22.224 --> 27:23.559
My mistake.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.354
JANE:

27:25.769 --> 27:27.354
<i>This whole thing's a mistake.</i>

27:27.354 --> 27:29.856
I'm gonna text Dennis

27:27.354 --> 27:29.856
and call the date off.

27:29.856 --> 27:31.358
You are not.

27:29.856 --> 27:31.358
Michael's his friend.

27:31.358 --> 27:33.569
It feels like a betrayal.

27:33.569 --> 27:36.071
Michael would want you

27:33.569 --> 27:36.071
to be happy.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.655
With someone else.

27:37.655 --> 27:40.200
Yeah, but you don't have

27:37.655 --> 27:40.200
feelings for someone else.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.035
You have feelings for Dennis.

27:42.035 --> 27:44.037
That's the thing, I don't even

27:42.035 --> 27:44.037
know if I have feelings for him.

27:44.037 --> 27:45.498
You know, maybe

27:44.037 --> 27:45.498
this is just my way

27:45.498 --> 27:48.584
of trying to keep

27:45.498 --> 27:48.584
Michael in my life.

27:48.584 --> 27:49.918
ABUELA:

27:48.584 --> 27:49.918
Well,

27:49.918 --> 27:53.380
love is a grand

27:49.918 --> 27:53.380
and mysterious force.

27:53.380 --> 27:56.592
<i>Basta!</i> Do not make

27:53.380 --> 27:56.592
this about Jorge.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.010
Look, hon,

27:58.010 --> 27:59.553
it's one date.

27:59.553 --> 28:00.762
And you know what?

28:00.762 --> 28:02.764
Maybe it is about Michael.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.016
And maybe it isn't.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.976
But you won't know

28:04.016 --> 28:05.976
unless you go.

28:10.981 --> 28:13.400
Okay, fine.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.361
So where are you going

28:13.400 --> 28:15.361
with Jorge tonight?

28:16.487 --> 28:18.447
Your mother said

28:16.487 --> 28:18.447
no more Jorge talk.

28:18.447 --> 28:20.949
Go.

28:18.447 --> 28:20.949
I don't know!

28:20.949 --> 28:22.951
He's so romantic--

28:22.951 --> 28:24.995
He wants to surprise me.

28:24.995 --> 28:27.122
Isn't that the sweetest thing

28:24.995 --> 28:27.122
you've ever heard?

28:29.458 --> 28:32.336
All right. I got to run.

28:32.336 --> 28:34.296
There you are, Bruce!

28:34.296 --> 28:36.382
Hello, Rogelio.

28:34.296 --> 28:36.382
Oh, right, right.

28:36.382 --> 28:37.883
Courtroom decorum.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.176
Good to see you.

28:41.303 --> 28:42.555
What do you think?

28:42.555 --> 28:44.014
I know I don't look my best.

28:44.014 --> 28:46.099
I had my makeup artist

28:44.014 --> 28:46.099
age me up a little

28:46.099 --> 28:48.227
so the judge would

28:46.099 --> 28:48.227
take pity on me.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.603
Is it too much?

28:49.603 --> 28:51.647
You look fine.

28:51.647 --> 28:53.399
Is everything all right, buddy?

28:53.399 --> 28:54.983
Sorry I'm late.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.360
There she is.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.654
Hi, hi. Mwah.

29:01.323 --> 29:02.658
No.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.078
No, everything's

29:03.992 --> 29:06.078
not all right.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.287
I can't do this.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.539
What?

29:07.287 --> 29:08.539
Do what?

29:08.539 --> 29:09.789
You told me that

29:08.539 --> 29:09.789
I didn't have to,

29:09.789 --> 29:11.041
and I can't.

29:11.041 --> 29:13.085
It's... too painful.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.837
And more importantly,

29:13.085 --> 29:15.837
you were right.

29:15.837 --> 29:18.465
Given the way I feel, I can't

29:15.837 --> 29:18.465
properly represent Rogelio.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.092
But...

29:18.465 --> 29:20.092
What now?

29:20.092 --> 29:22.386
Ask for a continuance.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.386
The judge is gonna grant it

29:22.386 --> 29:24.012
because your lawyer

29:22.386 --> 29:24.012
is resigning.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.062
All right,

29:30.269 --> 29:32.062
let's get started.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.199
What just happened?

29:42.489 --> 29:44.199
Get him back.

29:44.199 --> 29:46.243
( whispers ):

29:44.199 --> 29:46.243
I can't.

29:46.243 --> 29:49.079
Your Honor, I'm sorry, but

29:46.243 --> 29:49.079
Rogelio needs a continuance.

29:49.079 --> 29:50.956
His lawyer quit.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.958
Ugh. Annoying.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.627
By law,

29:52.958 --> 29:54.627
Mr. De la Vega,

29:54.627 --> 29:57.671
you'll have reasonable time

29:54.627 --> 29:57.671
to find a new attorney.

29:57.671 --> 29:59.632
I can grant you

29:57.671 --> 29:59.632
one week.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.091
No, no, no, no,

29:59.632 --> 30:01.091
no, no, no,

30:01.091 --> 30:03.843
please, Your Honor,

30:01.091 --> 30:03.843
I can't postpone.

30:03.843 --> 30:05.178
I start a new

30:03.843 --> 30:05.178
telenovela tomorrow.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.430
I have to be in hair

30:05.178 --> 30:06.430
and makeup at 8:00 a.m.

30:06.430 --> 30:07.806
And even though I'm tiny,

30:07.806 --> 30:09.642
the camera picks up

30:07.806 --> 30:09.642
every detail, believe me.

30:09.642 --> 30:11.310
Just give me one minute.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.229
You have to get Bruce back.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.523
I can't.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.523
Why? You know how

30:14.229 --> 30:16.523
important this is.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.025
I broke up with him.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.025
Right in the middle of my case?

30:19.025 --> 30:21.654
Why would you do that?

30:19.025 --> 30:21.654
We'll talk about this later.

30:21.654 --> 30:22.821
No, I demand

30:21.654 --> 30:22.821
to know the reason.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.198
No, now!

30:22.821 --> 30:25.198
I'm in love with you!

30:56.438 --> 30:58.816
<i>Dennis and I are gonna go</i>

30:56.438 --> 30:58.816

Ah, mini-golf!

So romantic! The windmills!

31:46.530 --> 31:47.781
( laughs )

31:47.781 --> 31:49.742
Okay, I'm warming up.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.284
I haven't played in a while.

31:51.284 --> 31:53.203
I'm hearing

31:51.284 --> 31:53.203
a lot of excuses.

31:53.203 --> 31:55.414
Just like Michael...

31:55.414 --> 31:56.707
Sorry.

31:56.707 --> 31:58.166
I shouldn't have...

31:56.707 --> 31:58.166
No.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.710
We can talk about Michael.

31:59.710 --> 32:02.337
Well, once, he accused me

31:59.710 --> 32:02.337
of using those illegal balls

32:02.337 --> 32:03.589
that give you more distance.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.507
Oh, trust me, I get it.

32:05.507 --> 32:07.634
Mateo's a better sport.

32:07.634 --> 32:08.802
( chuckles )

32:08.802 --> 32:11.221
He also, one--

32:08.802 --> 32:11.221
Maybe we should...

32:11.221 --> 32:12.890
Oh.

32:12.890 --> 32:15.934
Just that, maybe we should

32:12.890 --> 32:15.934
try not to talk about Michael.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.395
Okay. No more sports stuff.

32:18.395 --> 32:21.356
Or work stuff.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.567
Have you spoken to Lindsay?

32:23.567 --> 32:25.985
Or ex-fiancée stuff.

32:25.985 --> 32:28.280
Right. Makes sense,

a couple creepers

What are you

33:23.585 --> 33:26.505
doing here?

33:26.505 --> 33:30.008
Look, I know I said some

33:26.505 --> 33:30.008
not very nice things about you.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.510
But our hotels

33:30.008 --> 33:31.510
are next door,

33:31.510 --> 33:32.928
and I don't want this

33:31.510 --> 33:32.928
getting in the way

33:32.928 --> 33:37.098
of us being neighbors,

33:32.928 --> 33:37.098
so I apologize.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.350
Yeah, right.

33:38.350 --> 33:39.935
That's not why you're here.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.186
Yes, it is.

33:41.186 --> 33:42.562
Okay, fine.

down a well.

33:46.274 --> 33:48.234

33:49.569 --> 33:52.238
Okay, fine. You're right.

33:52.238 --> 33:56.075
I'm also here because I like

33:52.238 --> 33:56.075
you. And I want to be with you.

33:57.995 --> 34:00.664
So can we just please

33:57.995 --> 34:00.664
put all this behind us?

34:00.664 --> 34:03.458
Sorry, the answer's still no.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.461
Why would I want

34:05.043 --> 34:06.461
to be with someone

34:06.461 --> 34:08.087
who's embarrassed

34:06.461 --> 34:08.087
to be with me?

34:08.087 --> 34:09.965
Are you serious?

34:09.965 --> 34:12.843
You called me a lowlife and said

34:09.965 --> 34:12.843
I was out of your league.

34:12.843 --> 34:14.219
First of all,

34:12.843 --> 34:14.219
that hurts.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.095
Second of all,

34:14.219 --> 34:16.095
you're uptight,

34:16.095 --> 34:18.264

34:16.095 --> 34:18.264
and no fun at all.

Aw. How did that not go in?

35:07.313 --> 35:10.149
Your stance is tragic

35:07.313 --> 35:10.149
and your swing is hopeless.

35:10.149 --> 35:12.110
That's a bit dramatic,

35:10.149 --> 35:12.110
don't you think?

35:12.110 --> 35:13.319
Don't worry.

35:13.319 --> 35:15.280
I'm gonna drop

35:13.319 --> 35:15.280
some hope on you.

35:16.406 --> 35:18.199
Show me your stance.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.619
Okay.

35:24.497 --> 35:26.499
Okay, now try it.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.091
Yes!

Thank you.

Uh, uh, oops.

35:42.933 --> 35:44.977
Uh, bathroom emergency.

35:51.357 --> 35:52.609
A bathroom emergency?

35:52.609 --> 35:55.278
I panicked.

35:52.609 --> 35:55.278
He was moving in closer,

35:55.278 --> 35:56.655
<i>and all of a sudden</i>

35:55.278 --> 35:56.655
<i>I wasn't sure</i>

35:56.655 --> 35:58.239
if I wanted him to kiss me.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.366
Or if I even remember how to,

35:58.239 --> 36:00.366
it's been so long.

36:00.366 --> 36:01.743
<i>And then I was thinking,</i>

36:00.366 --> 36:01.743
<i>the only way to get back</i>

36:01.743 --> 36:03.286
<i>on the horse</i>

36:01.743 --> 36:03.286
<i>is to get it over with.</i>

36:03.286 --> 36:05.080
Then I thought, no, that

36:03.286 --> 36:05.080
is not the right attitude.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.499
You should kiss him

36:05.080 --> 36:07.499
because he's really cute.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.001
Because he is really cute.

36:09.001 --> 36:11.086
( sighs deeply )

36:11.086 --> 36:12.587
So maybe I just freaked

36:12.587 --> 36:16.133
because I'm still not ready

36:12.587 --> 36:16.133
to kiss anyone yet.

36:16.133 --> 36:17.467
After Michael.

36:17.467 --> 36:18.677
Are you done?

36:18.677 --> 36:19.970
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:18.677 --> 36:19.970
Okay.

36:19.970 --> 36:21.513
You need to get back out there

36:21.513 --> 36:23.723
and tell Dennis

36:21.513 --> 36:23.723
exactly what you just told me.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.767
