contemporary eugenicists,

12:55.862 --> 12:57.602
that only the
strong will survive.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.822
- But aren't all
men created equal?

12:59.866 --> 13:02.477
- Ah, well, let me take
that in Tesla's own words.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.218
To quote Tesla, he said,

13:04.261 --> 13:06.655
"Science is but a
perversion of itself,

13:06.698 --> 13:09.701
"unless it has as
its ultimate goal

13:09.745 --> 13:12.661
"the betterment of mankind."

13:12.704 --> 13:14.924
Isn't that right, Mr. Harris?

13:14.968 --> 13:16.230
Mr. Harris!

13:16.273 --> 13:20.843
You see, I controlled
the resonant frequency

13:20.887 --> 13:23.498
of Mr. Harris, and so
I control Mr. Harris.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.893
- Is it true as a student
you put big speakers

13:26.936 --> 13:29.939
in your dorm's basement to
find the resonance frequency,

13:29.983 --> 13:32.202
and you almost brought it down?

13:32.246 --> 13:33.029
- Ah...

13:34.552 --> 13:36.946
At this time I can neither
deny nor confirm that report.

13:36.990 --> 13:39.906
[bell ringing]
Right, midterms, Friday!

13:39.949 --> 13:43.344
Those who fail to
evolve, fail to pass!

13:43.387 --> 13:45.215
Thank you very much.

13:45.259 --> 13:48.131
[footsteps pattering]
[students chattering]

13:48.175 --> 13:51.221
There you go, get that down you.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.876
Quintin's Chamomile Tea.

13:53.920 --> 13:58.272
Just the remedy for a long day
of interminable lectures, hm?

13:59.273 --> 14:00.317
Mm.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.929
You know, I couldn't
help but notice

14:02.972 --> 14:05.366
that you were a little
late this morning,

14:05.409 --> 14:08.760
and your answer in class was
a little less than convincing.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.719
- Why don't you just
use your wristwatch?

14:10.762 --> 14:11.981
It works.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.504
What is it with you
and that old thing?

14:13.548 --> 14:14.854
- This old thing?

14:14.897 --> 14:17.073
This, my dear, is
a special edition.

14:17.117 --> 14:19.554
Do you know that Tesla
used to sell these things

14:19.597 --> 14:22.296
from time to time to
put food on his table?

14:22.339 --> 14:24.951
And this one has a, you see
it has a scratch on the T,

14:24.994 --> 14:27.475
makes it very special.

14:27.518 --> 14:30.565
But you are avoiding
the subject.

14:30.608 --> 14:32.567
You went to see your brother
again this morning, didn't you?

14:32.610 --> 14:34.743
- That's not what I'm
here to talk about.

14:34.786 --> 14:38.181
- Be that as it may, if
you want to achieve success

14:38.225 --> 14:42.359
in science, you have to put
distractions aside and focus.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.406
You know, Esther, I
don't have a daughter,

14:45.449 --> 14:48.496
but if I did, I'd want
her to be just like you,

14:48.539 --> 14:50.324
with your special talents.

14:50.367 --> 14:51.716
Wind is inspiration, Esther,

14:51.760 --> 14:54.110
and windmills are
in short supply.

14:57.592 --> 14:59.420
- He's my brother,
and he's hurting.

14:59.463 --> 15:01.291
I can't just ignore him.

15:01.335 --> 15:03.554
- I know, and you've done
a lot for him already,

15:03.598 --> 15:06.601
but science needs
your special gift.

15:06.644 --> 15:08.646
So, science can help society

15:08.690 --> 15:10.692
and help your brother
along the way.

15:10.735 --> 15:12.781
- [clears throat] I, um...

15:12.824 --> 15:14.957
I brought you these to show you.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.567
[suspenseful music]

15:16.611 --> 15:17.829
- When was this?

15:17.873 --> 15:21.616
- Today, downtown, right
near this fault line.

15:21.659 --> 15:22.573
- Well, this is a...

15:23.574 --> 15:24.532
This is a counterwave.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.360
This is, this is serious.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.536
- Have you ever seen a
pattern like this before?

15:29.189 --> 15:30.016
[phone buzzing]

15:30.059 --> 15:31.974
- Oh, excuse me.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.367
[dramatic music]

15:33.410 --> 15:33.976
- [Esther] Is everything okay?

15:34.020 --> 15:34.803
- Uh.

15:36.109 --> 15:40.983
Yeah, I just, I have to
take care of something.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.377
It was just, something
just came up.

15:43.420 --> 15:44.813
Would you...

15:44.856 --> 15:47.903
Would you mind covering
my classes for me?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.774
And I need to take these.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.037
- Oh, actually, you know what?

15:51.080 --> 15:52.821
I wanted to keep this
chart for my research.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.779
Are you finished with
my notes on my thesis?

15:54.823 --> 15:56.390
- Yes, they're at my house.

15:56.433 --> 15:57.608
I'll...

15:57.652 --> 15:59.219
I'll leave them in my mailbox.

16:01.351 --> 16:02.613
- Okay.

16:02.657 --> 16:06.356
[suspenseful music]

Professor?

17:52.897 --> 17:54.812
[door creaking]

17:54.856 --> 17:57.685
Professor, it's me, Esther.

17:58.686 --> 18:03.560
[suspenseful music]
[heels clacking]

18:07.869 --> 18:08.652
Professor?

[papers rustling]

18:22.797 --> 18:25.582

18:57.788 --> 18:59.529
[engine revving]

18:59.573 --> 19:01.401
- [Dispatcher] 911,
what's your emergency?

19:01.444 --> 19:03.011
- [Esther] I'm a grad
student at Cal U.

19:03.054 --> 19:04.491
I think my professor's missing.

19:04.534 --> 19:07.407
He wasn't at his house,
and it was a total mess.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.626
- [Dispatcher] Do you have
any proof he's missing?

19:09.670 --> 19:11.193
- [Esther] No, but.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.543
- [Dispatcher] Ma'am, we can't
file a report for 48 hours.

19:13.587 --> 19:16.677
If he doesn't show up
after that, give us a call.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.548
- [Esther] That's
the best you can do?

19:18.592 --> 19:20.855
- [Dispatcher] I can connect
you with the local police.

19:20.898 --> 19:23.901
- [Esther] No, no, thank you.

19:23.945 --> 19:26.904
[engine humming]

[heels clacking]

[door creaking]

19:41.005 --> 19:43.660
[dramatic music]

19:55.933 --> 19:57.239
- What are you doing in here?

19:57.283 --> 19:59.023
- I work with the professor.

19:59.067 --> 20:00.808
- That's not what I asked.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.505
I asked you what you were doing.

20:02.549 --> 20:05.856
- Looking for the
professor, obviously.

20:05.900 --> 20:06.857
What happened here?

20:08.424 --> 20:09.860
- Well, you didn't
touch anything, did you?

20:09.904 --> 20:12.298
- I'm not stupid.

20:12.341 --> 20:14.909
- Okay, Einstein,
I'm just making sure.

20:14.952 --> 20:16.911
Cops should be here in a few.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.652
- Police aren't coming.

20:18.695 --> 20:19.870
Colin Ward, FBI.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.265
- Esther Dahlset.

20:23.309 --> 20:26.312
Why is the FBI involved
in a campus break-in?

20:26.355 --> 20:28.096
- And why aren't
the police coming?

20:28.139 --> 20:29.967
- 'Cause this is my case.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.057
- The professor did
a lot of work for us.

20:33.101 --> 20:35.277
- We don't need a
G Man to tell us

20:35.321 --> 20:37.323
that some students tried
to steal test answers.

20:37.366 --> 20:40.108
- Wait, do you know where
Professor Conrad is?

20:40.151 --> 20:42.241
- He told me earlier
he was leaving town

20:42.284 --> 20:44.112
and seemed to be in a hurry.

20:44.155 --> 20:45.896
- What is this all about?

20:45.940 --> 20:47.942
- Let's just say there are
a lot enemies of the State

20:47.985 --> 20:49.422
interested in his research.

20:52.816 --> 20:53.600
- Uh.

20:54.905 --> 20:57.168
- Is there any security
footage of this office?

20:57.212 --> 20:59.170
- Yeah, if it gets you
to leave campus, yeah.

21:00.650 --> 21:01.434
I'll show you.

21:04.611 --> 21:05.655
You, too.

21:06.961 --> 21:07.962
Okay.

21:10.704 --> 21:11.966
[video game music]

21:12.009 --> 21:12.923
[controller buttons clicking]

21:12.967 --> 21:14.751
- Yeah!

21:14.795 --> 21:17.580
Your death is sweet
to me, Shao Khan!

21:17.624 --> 21:21.149
- G Man, Einstein, meet
Rocky, our IT specialist.

21:21.192 --> 21:22.933
- They're not players.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.848
- No, this is reality.

21:24.892 --> 21:27.111
Can you pull footage
from the break-in?

21:27.155 --> 21:28.939
- Nothing's there, you sure
you want to see it again?

21:28.983 --> 21:30.941
- Humor me, we have guests.

21:30.985 --> 21:32.595
- Humor.

21:32.639 --> 21:33.640
Okay.

21:36.469 --> 21:37.687
Analog.

21:39.167 --> 21:41.387
- Double mocha latteccino!

21:41.430 --> 21:42.736
No foam.

21:42.779 --> 21:43.824
- Thanks.

21:45.521 --> 21:46.435
Nice hat.

21:46.479 --> 21:47.741
- Oh.

21:47.784 --> 21:49.177
- Ngh-ngh, ngh-ngh.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.700
[static buzzing]

21:50.744 --> 21:51.875
- What is this, a joke?

21:52.876 --> 21:53.921
It's all static.

21:56.532 --> 21:57.925
I got all I need.

21:58.795 --> 22:00.797
[footsteps pattering]

22:00.841 --> 22:02.973
- What a moron, what's the deal?

22:03.017 --> 22:05.324
- Professor Conrad is
missing, I'm really worried.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.281
- Is that really the only copy?

22:06.325 --> 22:07.456
- Of course not.

22:11.025 --> 22:12.722
You want me to use
my superpowers?

22:12.766 --> 22:13.984
Oh!

22:14.028 --> 22:15.334
- Can you pull an
image from that?

22:15.377 --> 22:18.337
- Duh, takes like
one to two days.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.556
- Okay, yes, use
your superpowers.

22:21.557 --> 22:24.778
[tape rattling]

22:24.821 --> 22:25.605
- Okay.

22:26.432 --> 22:28.434
[video game music]
Yeah!

22:28.477 --> 22:32.873
[water splashing]
[birds chirping]

22:32.916 --> 22:36.746
[computer beeping]

22:36.790 --> 22:39.967
[footsteps pattering]

22:42.012 --> 22:43.231
- Ms. Dahlset?

22:43.274 --> 22:45.059
I apologize for the intrusion.

22:45.102 --> 22:47.191
Dr. Conrad has spoken
so highly of you.

22:47.235 --> 22:48.758
- And you are?

22:48.802 --> 22:50.369
- Oh, forgive my manners.

22:50.412 --> 22:53.023
I'm Dr. Cyrus Stanton, FIT.

22:53.067 --> 22:56.070
Stuart was helping me on
some very sensitive research.

22:58.289 --> 22:59.943
- The professor had
mentioned FIT before,

22:59.987 --> 23:02.032
but he never told
me what it was.

23:02.076 --> 23:04.252
- Future Invested Technologies.

23:04.295 --> 23:07.951
We're what one might consider
an advanced think tank.

23:07.995 --> 23:10.824
We at FIT are committed
not only to thinking

23:10.867 --> 23:12.913
about the problems
but to solving them.

23:14.218 --> 23:16.220
- That sounds like Dr. Conrad,

23:16.264 --> 23:18.048
always trying to
better humanity.

23:18.092 --> 23:23.010
- Hmm, unfortunately not
everyone shares our value set.

23:23.053 --> 23:26.448
There are many governments
with most likely nefarious

23:26.492 --> 23:28.015
intentions out there who'd love

23:28.058 --> 23:30.321
to get their hands
on our research.

23:31.497 --> 23:34.369
Dr. Conrad was about to
submit his final frequency

23:34.413 --> 23:37.720
data research on earthquakes,
now we can't reach him.

23:37.764 --> 23:39.156
- Do you think he was taken?

23:39.200 --> 23:40.506
- It's quite possible.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.769
One of our colleagues,
a Douglas Cole,

23:42.812 --> 23:46.207
had mysteriously died yesterday.

23:46.250 --> 23:47.643
- I'm sorry.

23:47.687 --> 23:50.341
I wish that there was
something more that I could do.

23:50.385 --> 23:53.301
- Dr. Conrad had acquired a
little leather bound notebook

23:53.344 --> 23:55.608
from an antiquities dealer that

23:55.651 --> 23:57.479
was critical to our research.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.438
Perhaps you may
have come across it?

23:59.481 --> 24:00.874
- No.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.136
- Well, if you do come
across this notebook

24:02.179 --> 24:03.529
or hear from Dr. Conrad,

24:03.572 --> 24:05.487
please contact me
as soon as possible.

24:06.532 --> 24:09.099
- It's connected to
the recent tremors.

24:09.143 --> 24:10.971
- Yes, I believe
it is connected.

24:11.014 --> 24:14.104
So, please find Dr.
Conrad and his data

24:14.148 --> 24:15.976
before it's too late.

24:16.019 --> 24:17.107
- I'll see what I can do.

24:17.151 --> 24:18.152
- Excellent.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.459
Gentlemen, thank you.

24:20.502 --> 24:25.681

[suspenseful music]

24:34.951 --> 24:36.213
[computer beeping]

24:36.257 --> 24:38.651
- [Esther] Professor,
it'’s me Esther, again.

24:39.608 --> 24:41.305
Please call me back.

24:41.349 --> 24:44.352

and deadly diseases.

25:06.983 --> 25:08.332

25:08.376 --> 25:11.161
or more precisely,
drowning them in vibration.

25:11.205 --> 25:14.208
It just may be possible

My research has
been hijacked and

25:36.186 --> 25:37.840
they killed my
financier, Douglas Cole,

25:37.884 --> 25:39.929
and I'm afraid I maybe next.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.496
I'm so sorry.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.107
I didn't mean for you to be

Whatever you do, don't
go to the police.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.941
I think they may have
been compromised.

25:51.985 --> 25:55.379
There's an old brown
battered notebook

25:55.423 --> 25:57.425
in my office at work. You
have to find it, take it,

25:57.468 --> 25:59.862
and keep it hidden at all costs.

25:59.906 --> 26:02.865
The G-20 leaders meeting
downtown, they're in danger.

In fact, the whole of
downtown could be in danger.

attack is shrouded in mystery

26:26.933 --> 26:29.675
with both countries
remaining tight-lipped.

26:29.718 --> 26:32.242
Even the scope of the
attack is unusual.

26:32.286 --> 26:34.593
At least 21 people in Havana
have suffered a variety

26:34.636 --> 26:37.421
of strange illnesses,
including hearing loss,

26:37.465 --> 26:39.815

26:39.859 --> 26:42.296
The State Department has
ordered all US Embassy staff

be pretty desperate

27:04.100 --> 27:06.059

27:06.102 --> 27:07.887

clear of these people.

27:09.323 --> 27:11.020
They don't mess around.

27:11.064 --> 27:13.893

thousands could die.

27:13.936 --> 27:15.808
You want me to just steer clear?

27:15.851 --> 27:18.071

27:18.114 --> 27:20.247
You'll end up getting
yourself killed.

27:20.290 --> 27:21.770
- What's your plan?

27:21.814 --> 27:25.382
Just hide out here, give
up, that's your solution?

27:25.426 --> 27:26.253
- Works for me.

27:30.344 --> 27:32.476
- Maybe if you got
your ears blown out

27:32.520 --> 27:34.565
you'd be a little
more cautious too.

27:35.436 --> 27:37.481
And you should be,
you're being followed.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.135
- What, I am not being followed.

27:39.179 --> 27:41.529
How would you know?
- I just know.

27:43.139 --> 27:44.924
- I have to do this.

27:45.576 --> 27:47.143
I'll do it with or without you.

he became very secretive

50:13.184 --> 50:15.882
- Fire alarm, pfft,
I got it in my sleep.

50:15.925 --> 50:16.883
- Okay, when the alarm goes off,

50:16.926 --> 50:18.711
everyone will exit the building.

50:18.754 --> 50:20.930
The electronic door locks
will automatically open,

50:20.974 --> 50:22.410
and the professor gets out.

50:22.454 --> 50:25.457
Paul, you'll help him escape
to our van in the street.

50:25.500 --> 50:26.675
And Esther keeps Cyrus busy.

50:27.676 --> 50:29.113
Foolproof.

50:29.156 --> 50:30.505
- I don't like it.

50:30.549 --> 50:32.377
- Well, do you
have a better idea?

50:32.420 --> 50:34.422
- Suppose the guards
take the professor?

50:37.904 --> 50:39.645
- Then this is our backup plan.

50:40.515 --> 50:43.127
- A video camera with
a wifi geo-tagger.

50:43.170 --> 50:45.738
Put this on, it looks
just like a brooch.

50:45.781 --> 50:47.087
If the professor is there,

50:47.131 --> 50:48.045
a picture of him will
help get a warrant

50:48.088 --> 50:49.742
to search the building.

50:49.785 --> 50:52.701
Or hopefully you can get
Cyrus incriminating himself.

50:54.138 --> 50:55.574
- These contacts.

50:57.097 --> 50:59.143
These contacts will let you

50:59.186 --> 51:02.059
see the full
electromagnetic spectrum,

51:02.102 --> 51:03.712
not just visible light.

51:03.756 --> 51:05.366
- And what will that get me?

51:05.410 --> 51:08.717
- Body temperature
displays, heat signatures.

51:08.761 --> 51:10.676
You can see through walls!

51:10.719 --> 51:11.590
- Night vision?

51:11.633 --> 51:13.026
- Of course.

51:13.070 --> 51:16.073
You can even see invisible
sonic frequencies.

51:16.943 --> 51:19.163
Sonic gunfire.

51:19.206 --> 51:20.947
- I want some!

51:20.990 --> 51:22.470
- Patience, grasshopper.

51:22.514 --> 51:23.950
Okay?

51:23.993 --> 51:25.343
In good time, you
will all get them.

51:25.386 --> 51:27.954
- Wait, what if the professor's
cell doesn't unlock?

51:29.434 --> 51:32.741
[computer keys clicking]

51:32.785 --> 51:34.265
- Combo locks look like this?
- Uh huh.

51:34.308 --> 51:37.398
- Oh, no sweat, they're
Smith Lock, old issue.

51:38.660 --> 51:42.708
This will confuse the lock
chip, opens it by default.

51:42.751 --> 51:44.927
- This is military,
where'd you get it?

51:44.971 --> 51:45.754
- eBay.

51:51.586 --> 51:53.110
- Are we ready to rumble?

51:53.153 --> 51:54.198
- Let's do this.

51:54.241 --> 51:55.068
[hands clapping]

51:55.112 --> 51:57.897
[thrilling music]

52:11.780 --> 52:14.522
All right, we're
here, get to work.

52:14.566 --> 52:17.699
[computer keys clicking]

52:19.223 --> 52:22.095
[hand knocking]

52:24.489 --> 52:27.405
- Ms. Dahlset,
lovely to see you.

52:27.448 --> 52:28.884
We've been expecting you.

52:28.928 --> 52:30.973
[Esther clears throat]
Please follow me.

52:35.064 --> 52:39.765
[computer beeping]
[computer keys clicking]

52:39.808 --> 52:40.635
[footsteps pattering]

52:40.679 --> 52:42.028
- Is it safe down here?

52:42.071 --> 52:44.161
- Oh, yes, they're just
running a test in that lab.

52:44.204 --> 52:46.554
So, we shouldn't stay too long.

52:46.598 --> 52:48.556
They're on an extreme deadline.

52:48.600 --> 52:50.036
If you please, may
I have the notebook?

52:50.079 --> 52:54.214
- Oh, actually, I didn't know
if it was the real thing.

52:54.258 --> 52:57.565
So, I took some photos
of some of the pages.

52:57.609 --> 52:58.871
What do you think?

52:58.914 --> 53:00.873
- Well, if those aren't
Tesla's initials,

53:00.916 --> 53:02.875
they're quite a good forgery.

53:02.918 --> 53:04.181
If you don't mind, I'm
gonna have to keep this.

53:04.224 --> 53:06.574
- Wait, actually, I do mind.

53:06.618 --> 53:08.663
I was just gonna text a
few friends about dinner,

53:08.707 --> 53:10.230
you know, but.

53:10.274 --> 53:13.407
- Ms. Dahlset, I think it's
time we stopped playing games.

53:13.451 --> 53:15.757
I believe this is what
you're looking for.

53:15.801 --> 53:18.195
[suspenseful music]

53:18.238 --> 53:19.413
- [gasps] Professor.

53:20.414 --> 53:21.850
Are you okay?

53:21.894 --> 53:24.462
[Professor groans]

53:24.505 --> 53:26.681
- Expecting something?

53:26.725 --> 53:28.901
A fire alarm, perhaps?

53:28.944 --> 53:30.511
Oh, yes, we've been
tapping your phone.

53:30.555 --> 53:33.035
Let me make this simple.

53:33.079 --> 53:35.516
Tell me where the
notebook is or die.

53:35.560 --> 53:40.565
[crickets chirping]
[devices beeping]

53:45.657 --> 53:48.616
[computer beeping]

53:48.660 --> 53:49.878
- It's 8:05, where's the fire?

53:49.922 --> 53:52.664
- The wifi's dead,
I can't do it.

53:52.707 --> 53:55.536
[siren blaring]

53:55.580 --> 53:59.714
[dispatcher chattering]

53:59.758 --> 54:01.455
- You're gonna have
to move the van.

54:02.108 --> 54:04.197
- We're picking up someone.

54:04.241 --> 54:06.417
- No parking, no standing.

54:06.460 --> 54:08.897
Move, now.

54:08.941 --> 54:09.942
- Yes, sir, officer.

54:14.251 --> 54:15.252
[door closing]

54:15.295 --> 54:19.038

[door closing]

54:22.694 --> 54:25.479
[engine revving]

54:27.481 --> 54:29.570
- No, Loki, you will
not win this battle.

54:29.614 --> 54:32.617
[suspenseful music]

54:50.330 --> 54:52.289
- What did they do to you?

54:52.332 --> 54:55.161
- [sigh] Some kind
of sonic torture.

54:56.075 --> 54:58.295
Brain feels like it's
been in a microwave.

54:58.338 --> 55:00.166
- You used to work
with these people?

55:00.209 --> 55:03.387
- They weren't always like this.

55:03.430 --> 55:07.347
We were trying to save lives
by stopping earthquakes.

55:07.391 --> 55:10.089
- They're starting them,
they're killing innocent people.

55:10.132 --> 55:12.700
I mean, collapsing downtown?

55:12.744 --> 55:14.746
- That wasn't part
of the original plan.

55:15.747 --> 55:19.403
We were gonna fix
nature's flaws.

55:19.446 --> 55:21.840
Just trying to help
its evolution.

55:23.232 --> 55:25.670
- Sounds to me like you
were trying to play God.

55:25.713 --> 55:30.196
- I was just trying to use
my science to perfect nature.

55:30.239 --> 55:34.940
- And the goal being
what, to better humanity?

55:36.202 --> 55:38.160
I mean, it seems like
you get to decide

55:38.204 --> 55:39.858
who lives and who dies.

55:39.901 --> 55:43.427
The weak, like my brother.
What, he's just tossed aside?

55:43.470 --> 55:45.733
- FIT is targeting the G-20.

55:45.777 --> 55:47.779
- Yeah, we know.

55:47.822 --> 55:49.346
Can we stop it?

55:49.389 --> 55:50.782
- Maybe.

55:51.435 --> 55:52.349
But not from here.

55:52.392 --> 55:55.569

56:19.071 --> 56:20.246
- Keep it on him.

56:21.247 --> 56:22.640
- No, no, no, no, please!

56:22.683 --> 56:23.815
- Wait, no, hey!

56:23.858 --> 56:25.077
- On your knees.

56:25.120 --> 56:26.339
- Why are you doing this?

56:26.383 --> 56:29.211
- The human race has to evolve.

56:29.255 --> 56:31.431
- By destroying Los Angeles?

56:31.475 --> 56:35.000
- By replacing leaders who
don't share our beliefs

56:35.043 --> 56:36.393
with those who do.

56:36.436 --> 56:37.872
- You'll never get
away with this.

56:37.916 --> 56:40.571
- It's an earthquake,
a natural disaster.

56:40.614 --> 56:42.703
They'll pin it on
the usual suspects.

56:42.747 --> 56:45.793
Mother nature,
the universe, God.

56:47.665 --> 56:51.103
Now, if you please, where is
the rest of that notebook?

56:51.146 --> 56:54.323
- Why, so you can create
even bigger disasters?

56:54.367 --> 56:56.978
- You don't seem to be
grasping how this works.

56:57.022 --> 56:58.066
[gun buzzing]

56:58.110 --> 56:59.416
The notebook.

56:59.459 --> 57:00.242
[Professor groans]

57:00.286 --> 57:01.287
The notebook!

57:01.330 --> 57:02.680
- I don't have it.
- Again.

57:02.723 --> 57:03.420
[gun buzzes]
[Professor groans]

57:03.463 --> 57:05.378
- No, don't, stop!

57:05.422 --> 57:07.032
- Where's the rest
of that notebook?

57:07.075 --> 57:09.295
The professor knows
better than anyone,

57:09.338 --> 57:12.429
we as a species are on
the verge of extinction,

57:12.472 --> 57:14.735
and the remedy lies
within that book.

57:14.779 --> 57:16.955
You see, we can no longer
be subject to the whims

57:16.998 --> 57:18.826
of these inept politicians,

57:18.870 --> 57:22.482
whose policies maintain the
survival of the weakest.

57:22.526 --> 57:25.180
We need to establish
a new world order

57:25.224 --> 57:27.356
where only the fittest may rule.

57:27.400 --> 57:30.403
- No, no, we all have value.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.449
People are created equally.

57:32.492 --> 57:33.885
- We weren't created.

57:33.928 --> 57:36.888
We're merely a product
of time and chance.

57:37.802 --> 57:41.762
Either we take control
of our own destiny,

57:41.806 --> 57:43.764
or we go the way
of the dinosaurs.

57:43.808 --> 57:46.288
- What about people
that, that are deaf, hm?

57:46.332 --> 57:48.421
Or maybe not as smart?

57:48.465 --> 57:49.857
We just do away with them.

57:49.901 --> 57:52.077
- I think Nietzsche
had it right.

57:52.120 --> 57:54.688
If we are to build a superhuman,

57:54.732 --> 57:58.692
we must first eliminate
those who are flawed.

57:58.736 --> 58:01.347
- Cyrus, please, this isn't
what we set out to do.

58:01.390 --> 58:03.871
- Shh, but it's what we must do.

58:03.915 --> 58:08.180
Now please, let's make
it easy on all of us.

58:08.223 --> 58:09.616
Where's the rest of that book?

58:09.660 --> 58:12.924

1:00:10.171 --> 1:00:11.999
- In English?

1:00:12.043 --> 1:00:13.261
- Hack into water and power,

1:00:13.305 --> 1:00:14.959
and shut down the
block's power grid.

[computer beeping]

1:02:24.218 --> 1:02:26.438
- Give him the
wrath of Khan, now!

1:02:27.352 --> 1:02:28.396
[computer beeping]

[weapons blasting]

1:02:32.444 --> 1:02:35.490
[suspenseful music]
- Come on guys, hurry up.

1:02:35.534 --> 1:02:37.536
Let's go. Glad to see you.

1:02:37.579 --> 1:02:38.929
- Let's go, guys.

1:02:42.628 --> 1:02:43.934
- You'’re a life saver.

1:02:43.977 --> 1:02:45.413
[lips smacking]

1:02:45.457 --> 1:02:46.806
[Frank chuckling]

1:02:46.850 --> 1:02:49.635
[engine humming]

1:02:50.636 --> 1:02:52.029
[thrilling music]

1:02:52.072 --> 1:02:54.640
- It was an earthquake,
a natural disaster.

1:02:54.683 --> 1:02:56.860
We'll pin it on
the usual suspects.

1:02:56.903 --> 1:03:00.385
Mother nature,
the universe, God.

1:03:01.603 --> 1:03:03.257
- [Esther] Wait, stop!

1:03:03.301 --> 1:03:05.303
- If you please, the rest of
the notebook, where is it?

1:03:05.346 --> 1:03:07.261
- [Esther] Why, so you can
create even-- [button clicking]

1:03:07.305 --> 1:03:08.654
- I've seen enough.

1:03:08.697 --> 1:03:10.787
You did the right
thing in coming to me.

1:03:10.830 --> 1:03:12.658
- So, now you get a warrant.

1:03:12.701 --> 1:03:14.442
- Well, we already have
a team on the way.

1:03:15.443 --> 1:03:17.794
[phone ringing]

1:03:17.837 --> 1:03:18.620
Talk to me.

1:03:20.884 --> 1:03:22.581
Gone, what do you mean
everything's gone?

1:03:22.624 --> 1:03:24.452
- Gone, it's impossible.

1:03:24.496 --> 1:03:25.279
- Yeah.

1:03:27.891 --> 1:03:30.763
They must've had a contingency
for something like this.

1:03:30.807 --> 1:03:32.199
- So, what now?

1:03:32.243 --> 1:03:33.679
- Well, we tighten
security in the G-20,

1:03:33.722 --> 1:03:36.029
and we start to track them down.

1:03:36.073 --> 1:03:37.683
- No, I heard that they
can remotely access

1:03:37.726 --> 1:03:39.728
the HAARP arrays, which means
they could set off this quake

1:03:39.772 --> 1:03:41.905
from anywhere in the city.

1:03:41.948 --> 1:03:43.689
- Well, then you and the
doctor better come up

1:03:43.732 --> 1:03:45.822
with some whizzbang
way to stop this thing.

1:03:47.214 --> 1:03:49.782
You still haven't found that
elusive notebook yet, have you?

1:03:49.826 --> 1:03:50.609
- Ngh-ngh.

1:03:52.916 --> 1:03:54.134
- How is the doctor?

1:03:56.006 --> 1:03:57.485
- He's pretty shaken up.

1:03:59.487 --> 1:04:02.142
- Well, I'd still like to
see him as soon as possible.

1:04:02.186 --> 1:04:05.058
In fact, I'd like to see the
whole team for a debrief.

1:04:05.102 --> 1:04:06.668
Could you get them
here within the hour?

1:04:06.712 --> 1:04:08.148
- Sure, we can do that.

1:04:08.192 --> 1:04:09.236
- Good.

1:04:10.063 --> 1:04:11.108
Oh, and Frank.

1:04:13.675 --> 1:04:15.286
I owe you an apology.

1:04:15.329 --> 1:04:17.157
I underestimated you.

1:04:17.201 --> 1:04:18.332
You're a good cop.

1:04:19.203 --> 1:04:19.986
No hard feelings?

1:04:23.642 --> 1:04:24.425
- Freeze that.

1:04:24.469 --> 1:04:25.513
[computer beeping]

1:04:25.557 --> 1:04:26.471
[energy whooshing]

1:04:26.514 --> 1:04:27.602
[suspenseful music]

1:04:27.646 --> 1:04:28.429
- None at all.

1:04:29.996 --> 1:04:33.260
[suspenseful music]

1:04:34.566 --> 1:04:35.741
- See you shortly.

1:04:37.699 --> 1:04:39.527
- I think that went really well.

1:04:41.965 --> 1:04:43.444
- We need to get outta here.

1:04:44.532 --> 1:04:45.272
- What?

1:04:45.316 --> 1:04:46.752
What's wrong?

1:04:46.795 --> 1:04:47.971
- Did you see the
lighting tattoo?

1:04:48.014 --> 1:04:50.016
It's the same as the
video on the break-in.

1:04:50.060 --> 1:04:51.713
- Wait, you think
he's working for FIT?

1:04:51.757 --> 1:04:53.193
- Absolutely, come on.

1:04:53.237 --> 1:04:55.239
[suspenseful music]

1:04:55.282 --> 1:04:56.501
Come on.

1:04:56.544 --> 1:04:59.547
[suspenseful music]

1:05:03.203 --> 1:05:06.206
[heels clacking]

1:05:06.250 --> 1:05:09.906
[letters clicking]

1:05:09.949 --> 1:05:13.126
[suspenseful music]

1:05:13.953 --> 1:05:14.823
- So?

1:05:14.867 --> 1:05:15.737
- Colin is definitely involved.

1:05:15.781 --> 1:05:17.174
- Then we go to the police.

1:05:17.217 --> 1:05:19.219
- No, I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

1:05:19.263 --> 1:05:21.221
- Look, if the FBI
has been compromised,

1:05:21.265 --> 1:05:24.398
then you can bet the
police have been, too.

1:05:24.442 --> 1:05:26.531
FIT's got people everywhere.

1:05:26.574 --> 1:05:28.315
- We're gonna have to
do this all ourselves.

1:05:28.359 --> 1:05:29.795
- Are we safe here?

1:05:29.838 --> 1:05:32.145
- It's a homeless shelter,
they're not coming here.

1:05:33.016 --> 1:05:35.192
- So, do we have a plan?

1:05:35.235 --> 1:05:37.716
- As a matter of fact, we do.

1:05:37.759 --> 1:05:40.675
You see, they're planning to

1:05:40.719 --> 1:05:44.244
trigger a destructive seismic
wave in one direction,

1:05:44.288 --> 1:05:46.768
so we will generate
a similar wave

1:05:46.812 --> 1:05:49.467
in the opposite direction.

1:05:49.510 --> 1:05:51.338
- Oh, sorta like the
noise canceling earbuds

1:05:51.382 --> 1:05:53.558
that I use to drown out Frank.

1:05:53.601 --> 1:05:55.429
- Oh, something like that.

1:05:55.473 --> 1:05:58.432
The fact is that
the result will be,

1:05:58.476 --> 1:06:02.219
there'll be no wave, or at least
a significantly weaker one.

1:06:02.262 --> 1:06:02.871
- Paul.

1:06:04.830 --> 1:06:06.266
You were amazing today.

1:06:07.137 --> 1:06:09.791
- Yeah right.
- No, I mean it.

1:06:09.835 --> 1:06:12.229
It was nice getting to hang
with my big brother again.

1:06:14.144 --> 1:06:15.188
- Oh.

1:06:15.972 --> 1:06:16.798
I had this.

1:06:18.104 --> 1:06:20.367
Meant to return it.

1:06:20.411 --> 1:06:21.586
- [Esther] Oh.

1:06:21.629 --> 1:06:24.197
[gentle music]

1:06:30.899 --> 1:06:32.118
Come on.

1:06:32.162 --> 1:06:34.033
- Professor, before
you lay out the plan,

1:06:34.077 --> 1:06:36.253
I think I can speak for
all of us when I say

1:06:37.210 --> 1:06:38.820
we need to know
where your heart is.

1:06:40.170 --> 1:06:42.215
Tomorrow's not a drill.

1:06:42.259 --> 1:06:45.088
Our lives are on the line,
along with all of L.A.

1:06:46.045 --> 1:06:49.440
Is your allegiance still
with FIT or with us?

1:06:50.789 --> 1:06:51.920
- Fair question.

1:06:52.486 --> 1:06:56.882
I, uh, I need to
apologize to all of you.

1:06:56.925 --> 1:07:00.016
[sighs] As you know,
I'm a pompous, arrogant,

1:07:00.059 --> 1:07:02.322
old-fashioned academic.

1:07:02.366 --> 1:07:06.413
I haven't treated you with
the respect that you deserve,

1:07:06.457 --> 1:07:10.461
well, anyone deserves for
that matter, until today.

1:07:11.505 --> 1:07:15.509
From here on in, I
will be honored to work

1:07:15.553 --> 1:07:17.468
alongside each and
every one of you.

1:07:17.511 --> 1:07:19.035
[hand patting]

1:07:19.078 --> 1:07:22.342
So, shall we stop this thing?

1:07:23.952 --> 1:07:24.736
- I'm in.

1:07:25.693 --> 1:07:26.477
- In.
- In.

1:07:27.434 --> 1:07:28.870
- In.

1:07:28.914 --> 1:07:32.135
- Well, I'm like
totally in. [laughs]

1:07:32.178 --> 1:07:34.485
- Oh, well, I'm
like totally in, too.

1:07:34.528 --> 1:07:35.703
[group laughing]

1:07:35.747 --> 1:07:37.357
- [Together] Yeah!

1:07:37.401 --> 1:07:40.447
[thrilling music]

1:07:42.406 --> 1:07:43.929
- [George] At least
without the notebook,

1:07:43.972 --> 1:07:46.105
they can't create
a bigger quake.

1:07:46.149 --> 1:07:48.194
- [Professor] Yeah, but
they still could collapse

1:07:48.238 --> 1:07:49.587
most of downtown.

1:07:49.630 --> 1:07:52.416
[thrilling music]

1:08:01.947 --> 1:08:03.514
Even without Tesla's notebook,

1:08:03.557 --> 1:08:06.125
FIT's been able to
assemble three HAARP arrays

1:08:06.169 --> 1:08:09.955
located on freighters
about 12 miles offshore.

1:08:09.998 --> 1:08:11.913
And each one will fire
a high-frequency pulse

1:08:11.957 --> 1:08:13.350
into the ionosphere.

1:08:13.393 --> 1:08:14.568
When it bounces back to Earth,

1:08:14.612 --> 1:08:16.917
it'll trigger a
vertical seismic event

1:08:16.961 --> 1:08:18.702
onto Los Angeles.

1:08:18.746 --> 1:08:20.139
- To stop this,
the Professor and I

1:08:20.183 --> 1:08:22.968
will drive to the
mountain bluffs in my van.

1:08:23.011 --> 1:08:25.970
We'll set up a microwave dish

1:08:26.014 --> 1:08:28.626
to radio the beta
freighter's control system.

1:08:28.669 --> 1:08:30.628
- And once I've hacked
into the beta array,

1:08:30.671 --> 1:08:33.544
I can send out a counterwave
to cancel out the alpha.

1:08:33.586 --> 1:08:37.721
Unfortunately, the gamma
freighter's too far away.

1:08:37.764 --> 1:08:39.202
Esther and Paul,

1:08:39.245 --> 1:08:41.029
you guys will break
into west side command

1:08:41.073 --> 1:08:42.943
that sends signals
to the freighters.

1:08:42.987 --> 1:08:44.511
- Here.

1:08:44.555 --> 1:08:47.949
Put this virus into their system
and it will stop the gamma.

1:08:47.993 --> 1:08:52.563
- Beta down, alpha down,
gamma down, we win!

1:08:52.606 --> 1:08:53.781
No earthquake!

1:08:53.825 --> 1:08:55.042
[Professor chuckles]
[hands slapping]

1:08:55.086 --> 1:08:56.435
- Guys, I hate to
be a spoiler here,

1:08:56.479 --> 1:08:59.612
but I'm not exactly the
best in an earthquake.

1:08:59.657 --> 1:09:01.485
- Hey, you'll be fine,
I'll be with you.

1:09:01.528 --> 1:09:04.531
- And where's this
FIT's command post?

1:09:04.575 --> 1:09:06.011
- And what about the guards?

1:09:06.054 --> 1:09:07.491
- Yeah, well, I got a quick
look at their schematics,

1:09:07.533 --> 1:09:11.886
and I think it's located
somewhere in an industrial park,

1:09:11.930 --> 1:09:14.367
somewhere here on the Westside.

1:09:14.411 --> 1:09:16.630
Once they send signals
to the freighters,

1:09:16.674 --> 1:09:19.285
I'll be able to triangulate
its exact position.

1:09:19.328 --> 1:09:22.201
- So, we stage here and
wait for your signal.

1:09:22.245 --> 1:09:23.810
- Yeah, but what
about the guards?

1:09:23.854 --> 1:09:26.553
We'd need an army
to get past them.

1:09:26.596 --> 1:09:27.772
- I have an army.

1:09:27.815 --> 1:09:28.728
- The role players?

1:09:28.773 --> 1:09:30.731
Oh no.

1:09:30.774 --> 1:09:32.255
- Hey, flatfoot.

1:09:32.298 --> 1:09:34.560
Me, Dragonovich and Thing Master

1:09:34.604 --> 1:09:36.476
defeated the Queen of Darkness

1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:38.478
and a quarter of the
universe last week.

1:09:38.522 --> 1:09:40.611
This is child's play.

1:09:40.654 --> 1:09:42.439
- Yeah, wait a minute,
she's onto something.

1:09:42.482 --> 1:09:45.310
We can overwhelm the
guards with numbers.

1:09:45.354 --> 1:09:47.226
I mean, they're not gonna

1:09:47.270 --> 1:09:49.054
shoot a bunch of
superheroes, right?

1:09:49.096 --> 1:09:50.185
- Yeah, the last thing FIT wants

1:09:50.228 --> 1:09:52.231
is attention from
the police, right?

1:09:52.274 --> 1:09:54.799
- Frank, how many burgers do
you think you could wrangle up?

1:09:54.842 --> 1:09:55.800
- Why?

1:09:55.843 --> 1:09:57.062
- I have an idea.

1:09:57.105 --> 1:09:58.411
- Save the universe?

1:09:59.195 --> 1:10:01.022
- [Both] Save the Universe!

1:10:01.066 --> 1:10:03.199
[suspenseful music]

1:10:03.242 --> 1:10:06.114
[letters clicking]

1:10:07.550 --> 1:10:10.815
[suspenseful music]

1:10:11.990 --> 1:10:15.036
- In a few hours, 20 of the
world's most powerful leaders

1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:19.040
will meet to determine the
future of our economies.

1:10:19.084 --> 1:10:20.912
The security here is so tight,

1:10:20.955 --> 1:10:23.871
not even the media
is allowed inside.

1:10:23.915 --> 1:10:27.484
[boat horn honking loudly]

1:10:28.267 --> 1:10:31.443
[suspenseful music]

1:10:33.403 --> 1:10:36.057
- Try to the left a bit, left.

1:10:36.101 --> 1:10:37.842
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:10:37.885 --> 1:10:41.498
Okay, hold it, hold
it right there.

1:10:41.541 --> 1:10:42.412
[computer keys clicking]

1:10:42.455 --> 1:10:44.849
Yes, there we go.

1:10:44.892 --> 1:10:46.371
Hello, my lovelies.

1:10:46.416 --> 1:10:47.808
All right, Cyrus's people
have linked to the freighters.

1:10:47.852 --> 1:10:48.766
[computer keys clicking]

1:10:48.809 --> 1:10:49.897
Tell 'em it's a go.

1:10:51.116 --> 1:10:52.552
- Game on.

1:10:52.596 --> 1:10:55.555
[suspenseful music]

1:10:57.383 --> 1:11:00.125

1:11:09.700 --> 1:11:12.659
[phone dinging]

1:11:13.398 --> 1:11:15.053
- That's the signal!

1:11:15.967 --> 1:11:18.230
- Company, move out!

1:11:18.273 --> 1:11:19.884
[group shouting]

1:11:19.927 --> 1:11:21.538
Let's head out!

1:11:21.581 --> 1:11:24.323

1:11:31.504 --> 1:11:32.897
- Yes, sir.

1:11:32.940 --> 1:11:34.898
We have commenced countdown.

1:11:36.770 --> 1:11:39.991
The array is at 75%.

1:11:40.034 --> 1:11:42.907
I understand, we will not fail.

1:11:42.950 --> 1:11:45.952
[suspenseful music]

1:11:47.651 --> 1:11:49.130
- All right, I'm in.

1:11:49.174 --> 1:11:52.177
I just need to make a
couple more calculations.

1:11:53.091 --> 1:11:54.832
But I can't send the signal

1:11:54.875 --> 1:11:57.965
until they activate
those other arrays.

1:11:58.009 --> 1:11:59.576
[suspenseful music]

1:11:59.619 --> 1:12:00.880
- Professor, we have company.

1:12:04.407 --> 1:12:06.103
- [sighs] You're gonna have
to get me two more minutes.

1:12:06.147 --> 1:12:07.758
Just two minutes.

1:12:08.715 --> 1:12:10.587
- Can't let you do
this, Professor.

1:12:15.026 --> 1:12:18.594
[gunshot blasting]

1:12:18.638 --> 1:12:20.639
Who brings a taser

1:12:41.182 --> 1:12:43.837
- Hey, I got a situation
here in the alley.

1:12:43.880 --> 1:12:44.882
I'm gonna need back up.

1:12:44.925 --> 1:12:47.972
[thrilling music]

1:12:48.799 --> 1:12:50.409

1:13:03.335 --> 1:13:05.946
This is not part of the plan!

1:13:27.315 --> 1:13:29.361
You guys go, we got this.

1:13:29.405 --> 1:13:31.014
- It's payback time.

1:13:32.016 --> 1:13:33.147
[people shouting]

1:13:33.191 --> 1:13:34.800

[alarm blaring]
[thrilling music]

1:13:44.157 --> 1:13:46.683
- It's okay, keep
working, keep working.

1:13:46.726 --> 1:13:47.771
Stay at your stations.

1:13:47.814 --> 1:13:49.860
Let's get some
security at the door.

[gun cocks]

1:14:07.530 --> 1:14:11.272
- Like I said, I
can't let you do this.

1:14:11.316 --> 1:14:15.102
- If you're not
FBI, who are you?

1:14:15.146 --> 1:14:17.540
- No, I am, but there's
just a few of us who wanna

1:14:17.583 --> 1:14:20.456
be on the winning side
when the dust settles.

1:14:22.327 --> 1:14:23.763
Now, I don't want
to have to kill you,

1:14:23.807 --> 1:14:28.115
so please take your hands
away from the keyboard.

Shoot him now!

[elbow smashing]

1:15:00.539 --> 1:15:02.541
Why isn't this working on him?

1:15:02.585 --> 1:15:03.368
- He's deaf!

1:15:04.717 --> 1:15:06.632
Move aside, genius.

1:15:06.675 --> 1:15:07.807
- Where did everybody go?

1:15:07.851 --> 1:15:09.940
- Don't even think about it.

1:15:09.983 --> 1:15:10.984

alpha and your beta.

1:16:30.629 --> 1:16:31.978
- Maybe you've forgotten.

1:16:32.022 --> 1:16:34.023
There's a solar array
that hasn't fired.

1:16:35.634 --> 1:16:37.462
- Not for long.
[button clicks]

1:16:37.505 --> 1:16:39.202

[weapon rattles]

1:16:43.424 --> 1:16:45.862
- Sometimes you have to do
things the old-fashioned way.

1:16:45.905 --> 1:16:48.212
Now, move away from the

1:17:32.343 --> 1:17:33.431
You think you can stop us.

1:17:33.474 --> 1:17:35.868
You haven't stopped anything.

1:17:35.912 --> 1:17:38.088
This is much bigger
than you, you know it.

1:17:38.130 --> 1:17:40.786
We will weed out the weak.

1:17:40.830 --> 1:17:41.657
- Weed this.

1:17:54.495 --> 1:17:56.062
- A flak jacket.

1:17:58.108 --> 1:18:01.502
I couldn't listen to that
blowhard another second.

1:18:01.546 --> 1:18:02.503

- Yeah, how does it feel
to be a weak one, huh?

1:18:11.817 --> 1:18:13.471
An expendable.

1:18:13.514 --> 1:18:15.125

[alarm blaring]

Paul, Paul, look at me.

1:18:48.853 --> 1:18:50.116
It's your sister,
you're gonna be okay.

1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:51.335
We've gotta get outta here, run.

Let's go get those burgers.

3.2 tumbler rocked

1:20:04.016 --> 1:20:06.192
Downtown Los Angeles today,

1:20:06.236 --> 1:20:08.847
temporarily halting
the G-20 Summit.

1:20:08.891 --> 1:20:11.850
Caltech reported it could
have been much worse.

1:20:11.894 --> 1:20:13.286
The vertical shift
fault could have

1:20:13.330 --> 1:20:15.941
brought the entire
central district down.

1:20:15.985 --> 1:20:18.770

[footsteps pattering]
[somber music]

1:20:36.222 --> 1:20:39.008
- Stuart's last words
were, "Thank you."

1:20:39.050 --> 1:20:40.574
He didn't have a wife or kids,

1:20:40.618 --> 1:20:43.621
but he said that you were the
closest family he ever had.

1:20:48.321 --> 1:20:50.715
- This garden was
like a home to him.

1:20:50.758 --> 1:20:53.282
He asked that his
ashes be spread here.

1:20:54.327 --> 1:20:55.459

1:21:05.338 --> 1:21:07.601
[lid clanging]

1:21:07.645 --> 1:21:09.299
- He was proud of you, you know.

1:21:11.344 --> 1:21:12.476
- I know.

1:21:13.433 --> 1:21:16.393
I feel like that's
why I owe it to him

1:21:16.436 --> 1:21:19.787
to continue his work and use
it as he originally intended.

1:21:24.357 --> 1:21:26.272
- So, what did the FBI
say about Colin?

1:21:27.056 --> 1:21:28.579
- The usual stonewalling.

1:21:29.536 --> 1:21:31.755
They can't comment on an
ongoing investigation.

1:21:34.367 --> 1:21:35.891
What about you?

1:21:35.934 --> 1:21:37.805
- I asked Paul to come stay
with me while he was in rehab

1:21:37.849 --> 1:21:39.633
and looking for a new job.

1:21:40.764 --> 1:21:41.766
- What type of job?

1:21:42.767 --> 1:21:44.290
- I don't know.

1:21:44.334 --> 1:21:46.205
But I'm thinking about putting
together a platoon of vets

1:21:46.249 --> 1:21:48.294
to take down mad scientists.

1:21:48.338 --> 1:21:50.209
[group laughing]

1:21:50.253 --> 1:21:51.036
You?

1:21:52.820 --> 1:21:55.388
- Continue taking night
classes to get my law degree.

1:21:57.260 --> 1:21:58.304
Staying in town.

1:22:00.002 --> 1:22:01.438
- In town is good.

1:22:01.481 --> 1:22:02.526
- [George] Oh.

1:22:02.568 --> 1:22:04.397
- Oooh!

1:22:04.441 --> 1:22:07.748
[George laughs]
[Rocky laughs]

1:22:07.791 --> 1:22:09.576
All right, you guys ready?

1:22:10.621 --> 1:22:15.626
[somber music]
[gravel crunching]

1:22:22.546 --> 1:22:25.027
Wait, did we ever
find the notebook?

1:22:26.028 --> 1:22:28.204
- Well, the formulas in
there could literally

1:22:28.246 --> 1:22:30.728
change the balance of
power of the world,

1:22:30.771 --> 1:22:33.557
so if FIT doesn't
have it then who does?

1:22:34.818 --> 1:22:35.820
- What, the notebook?

1:22:36.995 --> 1:22:38.518
Oh, I hid that.

1:22:38.562 --> 1:22:40.216
- [Group] What?

1:22:40.259 --> 1:22:43.045
- What, so they couldn't
connect it with you.

1:22:43.088 --> 1:22:44.611
Look, I think it's
caused enough trouble

1:22:44.655 --> 1:22:47.179
and maybe it needs to stay lost
for a few more generations.

1:22:50.661 --> 1:22:52.402
I hid it with Vic,
one of the vets.

1:22:53.142 --> 1:22:54.795
No one will ever find it.

1:22:56.058 --> 1:22:59.713
Believe me, the future
of mankind is safe.

1:23:19.210 --> 1:23:22.258
[thrilling music]

1:23:27.611 --> 1:23:30.657
- [Man] Bring me the book!

1:23:32.398 --> 1:23:35.401
[suspenseful music]

1:24:12.656 --> 1:24:15.441

1:25:24.771 --> 1:25:27.557
[thrilling music]

1:27:34.684 --> 1:27:37.513
