WEBVTT

01:08.441 --> 01:10.318
- Dad, hey.
- Harper, honey.

01:10.361 --> 01:11.570
You made it there in one piece?

01:11.611 --> 01:13.571
Yeah, fully intact.

01:13.614 --> 01:15.073
How's it look?

01:15.115 --> 01:16.325
It's
better than the pictures.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.993
All right.
Come on, give me a tour.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.328
Uh, how...

01:19.370 --> 01:22.039
Dad, don't even. Hold
on, don't try, hold on.

01:22.081 --> 01:24.207
I got it, I got it.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.501
Hey, can you see me?

01:26.543 --> 01:27.712
Hey, Dad.

01:27.753 --> 01:29.046
Hi, Harper.

01:29.087 --> 01:32.048
Give me a sec, I
gotta find the key.

01:32.090 --> 01:33.550
Brave new world.

01:33.591 --> 01:35.093
Hm?

01:35.135 --> 01:37.679
When you were a kid, I told
you not to talk to strangers,

01:37.721 --> 01:41.224
and definitely not to
go into their houses.

01:41.266 --> 01:42.768
Now you're making a
vacation out of both.

01:42.810 --> 01:46.522
Okay, it's not a
vacation, Dad. It's a trip.

01:46.563 --> 01:48.273
Semantics.

01:56.072 --> 01:58.158
It's perfect.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.993
Think you'll find
what you're looking for?

02:00.036 --> 02:02.537
Don't make it sound so lofty.

02:06.250 --> 02:08.877
Too small. What's it say?

02:08.919 --> 02:10.713
"Thank you for staying
at the Forest Preserve.

02:10.754 --> 02:12.632
We hope it will be
an oasis for you,

02:12.673 --> 02:14.467
the way it always
has been for us."

02:14.508 --> 02:16.594
Neil, come
on. We're gonna be late!

02:16.635 --> 02:19.930
Sorry to cut this short,
buttercup, but that's my cue.

02:19.972 --> 02:21.349
Denise?

02:21.389 --> 02:23.308
First week
of rumba classes.

02:24.268 --> 02:25.394
Don't look so surprised.

02:25.436 --> 02:27.438
Listen, I'll try
again tomorrow, okay?

02:27.479 --> 02:29.272
All right, don't break a hip.

02:29.314 --> 02:34.319
- I'll do my darndest.
- Bye, Dad.

03:45.015 --> 03:45.849
Hi.

03:47.685 --> 03:48.978
Hi.

03:49.020 --> 03:49.979
Who are you?

03:50.020 --> 03:51.396
Who are you?

03:51.438 --> 03:52.981
- You don't get to do that.
- Do what?

03:53.024 --> 03:54.775
You don't get to "who are
you" while I'm who are-ing you.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.152
You can't just walk
in here like you own-

03:56.193 --> 03:58.862
- My parents own this place.
- What?

04:00.031 --> 04:03.325
Sorry, are you
booked this weekend?

04:03.366 --> 04:04.951
Shit, uh, sorry.

04:04.993 --> 04:08.080
My dad told me he blocks
the weekends off for me.

04:08.122 --> 04:09.832
- He's not very text-savvy.
- Listen, I can just-

04:09.873 --> 04:11.709
- I can call him. I
should've double-checked.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.544
Let me just call him.

04:14.377 --> 04:15.712
Okay.

04:19.507 --> 04:22.177
Hey, Dad, you said this place
wasn't booked this weekend.

04:22.218 --> 04:25.014
Well, uh, it is and
she's here and I'm here,

04:25.055 --> 04:28.224
and you've gotta give her
her money back or something.

04:28.266 --> 04:32.146
Dad, I don't care. It's not a
good look for me or for you.

04:32.187 --> 04:34.606
Please just do it, thank you.

04:35.983 --> 04:38.069
He told me he's gonna
reverse the charges.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.862
Money should be back
on your card on Monday.

04:39.903 --> 04:41.363
Am I getting kicked out?

04:41.404 --> 04:44.407
No. No, uh, place is yours.

04:44.449 --> 04:48.120
Oh, well then the refund's
really not necessary.

04:48.161 --> 04:49.663
That's what my dad said too,

04:49.704 --> 04:51.873
but I spooked him with the
prospect of a bad review.

04:51.915 --> 04:54.125
This place hasn't really
been renting, so...

04:54.168 --> 04:56.336
Well, thank you.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.090
Thank you for the
restraint, by the way.

04:59.130 --> 05:00.632
I know the knife
drawer was probably

05:00.675 --> 05:01.968
looking pretty
tempting a second ago,

05:02.009 --> 05:03.970
but I assure you, I'm harmless.

05:04.011 --> 05:05.471
That's exactly what
a murderer would say.

05:05.512 --> 05:09.015
That is a fair point.

05:09.057 --> 05:09.891
I'm James.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.062
Harper.

05:13.103 --> 05:14.562
That's a cool name.

05:14.605 --> 05:18.109
Thanks, it was a
birthday present.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.444
Okay, uh...

05:27.617 --> 05:30.204
Um, hey, do you want a drink?

05:32.122 --> 05:34.291
I mean, you know, if you drink?

05:34.333 --> 05:36.127
Am I still a
suspected murderer?

05:36.168 --> 05:39.922
Well, totally, but if I have
any chance of escaping you,

05:39.963 --> 05:41.923
then I'm gonna have to
ply you with alcohol.

05:41.966 --> 05:44.802
At least, that's how I
survived the last guy, so-

05:44.843 --> 05:46.428
- I don't want to impose.

05:46.470 --> 05:48.180
- It's your house.
- Parents' house.

05:48.221 --> 05:50.098
- Same thing.
- Still.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.935
Look, I took a year of
jujitsu when I was eight,

05:52.976 --> 05:55.437
so I'm pretty sure I can kick
your ass if you try anything.

05:55.478 --> 05:57.522
Plus, my sister and I took
one of those like women's

05:57.564 --> 05:58.940
defense classes where
you learn to kill a guy

05:58.983 --> 06:01.610
with like a pen or a key or a...

06:03.362 --> 06:04.196
Oh, shit.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.283
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

06:08.492 --> 06:11.537
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.000
Yeah, I was wondering
whose this was.

06:16.041 --> 06:19.628
Thought maybe the cleaning
people were still around.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.672
Nope, it's mine!

06:21.713 --> 06:23.966
I can take you
into town, if you want,

06:24.007 --> 06:25.258
and get you some gas.

06:25.300 --> 06:26.926
No, I mean, it's fine.

06:26.968 --> 06:28.512
I have AAA, I'll
give them a call.

06:28.553 --> 06:33.016
I'm gonna be way faster out
here, if you want. You know.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.061
I mean, you've already
refunded the stay.

06:35.101 --> 06:36.770
I can't let you buy me gas.

06:36.812 --> 06:40.232
Oh, I didn't say
I was paying, so...

06:40.274 --> 06:41.399
Right.

06:42.692 --> 06:45.570
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah?

06:45.612 --> 06:49.240
Okay.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.994
So why Plymouth for
your getaway adventure,

06:52.036 --> 06:52.995
or whatever this is?

06:53.036 --> 06:54.996
Oh, um, I went to Middlebury.

06:55.038 --> 06:56.748
I haven't been back to
Vermont since graduation.

06:56.790 --> 07:00.168
I had the weekend, so I don't
know, I thought I'd just like-

07:00.211 --> 07:01.504
- Relive the glory days?

07:01.545 --> 07:05.049
Explore some places
I might have missed.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.636
I don't know, I swung through
campus on the way here, it's,

07:08.677 --> 07:09.887
it's different.

07:12.139 --> 07:14.766
Do people really do that?

07:14.809 --> 07:16.435
Like come back and go to parties

07:16.476 --> 07:18.103
where nobody knows them anymore?

07:18.144 --> 07:19.187
Some.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.355
- You?
- Oh, no.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.109
I mean, homecoming,
but you know.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.151
Where'd you go?

07:25.194 --> 07:27.612
- Dartmouth.
- And you graduated?

07:27.654 --> 07:28.780
Yes.

07:28.822 --> 07:30.407
My question was actually when.

07:30.449 --> 07:31.783
Four years ago.

07:31.826 --> 07:34.036
- Three.
- Huh, I'd have guessed two.

07:34.077 --> 07:35.203
Baby face?

07:35.245 --> 07:38.665
No, you just don't
look entirely jaded yet.

08:14.242 --> 08:15.076
Good luck.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.413
Got any CDs?

08:18.456 --> 08:23.044
Yeah, there
might be a couple in there.

08:23.084 --> 08:24.252
What!

08:24.295 --> 08:25.588
Oh, shit.

08:25.629 --> 08:27.839
Oh, my god. What's the album?

08:27.882 --> 08:29.466
It's a mix tape.

08:29.507 --> 08:31.051
No shit. Really?

08:32.386 --> 08:33.846
Really.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.974
Sorry I just haven't seen any
of these in the wild lately.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.934
Who made it?

08:39.976 --> 08:40.977
Uh, I did.

08:42.897 --> 08:43.980
Rad.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.399
- Let's listen.
- Uh...

08:46.442 --> 08:47.692
We all had a
Spice Girls phase.

08:47.735 --> 08:48.943
It is nothing to be ashamed of.

08:48.985 --> 08:50.446
It's personal.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.156
Your relationship
with the Spice Girls?

08:52.197 --> 08:54.283
It was for an ex, so...

08:55.701 --> 08:56.534
Got ya.

08:59.663 --> 09:00.997
Did she like it?

09:03.375 --> 09:05.001
She never got it.

09:05.043 --> 09:06.294
There's a story there.

09:06.336 --> 09:08.838
Not one for tonight.

09:08.880 --> 09:09.714
Come on.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.429
Is she from around here?

09:15.471 --> 09:18.014
Sort of. It was
a summer thing.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.557
I really wanna listen to it.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.310
Your request has been received

09:21.351 --> 09:22.812
and it's currently under review.

09:22.852 --> 09:24.354
Someone will get back to you
in three to five business days.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.149
- You're the worst.
- That's a popular opinion.

09:27.191 --> 09:28.067
Dramatic.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.947
Come on, just tell
me the good stuff.

09:32.989 --> 09:37.033
Like, what's the best date
you guys ever went on?

09:39.620 --> 09:42.123
You see that house over there?

09:42.163 --> 09:44.417
That's where Coolidge
got inaugurated.

09:44.457 --> 09:45.543
August, 1923.

09:47.043 --> 09:48.461
This messenger came through town

09:48.504 --> 09:50.214
and started telling everyone
that Harding had died,

09:50.255 --> 09:51.966
and Coolidge's dad swore
him in by candlelight

09:52.008 --> 09:55.177
- at like three in the morning.
- Why do you know that?

09:55.219 --> 09:58.139
I kinda obsess about the past.

09:58.179 --> 10:00.849
- History major?
- Uh, enthusiast.

10:00.890 --> 10:02.976
Think it makes for
good small talk.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.437
Is it working?

10:04.477 --> 10:06.396
I mean, you haven't
lost my interest yet.

10:06.438 --> 10:10.650
I just think
it's wild something so big

10:10.692 --> 10:13.528
could happen somewhere
so small, you know?

10:13.571 --> 10:14.404
Hm.

10:16.740 --> 10:19.284
So she's the one
who ended it, right?

10:19.326 --> 10:20.119
Hm?

10:20.160 --> 10:21.453
Mix tape girl?

10:22.705 --> 10:24.999
I mean, that's always
how it goes, right?

10:25.041 --> 10:27.001
No, not always.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.878
I mean, not to get
personal, but I mean, like,

10:28.918 --> 10:32.298
how many times has a guy been
the one to break up with you?

10:32.340 --> 10:34.591
I mean, I don't know,
but it's happened.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.677
Totally, totally. I just...

10:37.720 --> 10:39.555
Statistically, I just...

10:39.596 --> 10:41.389
Oh, uh, sorry. Hold on.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.058
Of course.

10:43.100 --> 10:43.933
Um...

10:45.101 --> 10:46.437
- I should-
- Totally, yeah, yeah.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.897
I can...

10:47.937 --> 10:50.149
- I'll be, yeah.
- Cool, okay.

10:53.735 --> 10:54.611
Hey, sorry.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.114
No, I'm there.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.009
- Oh, that's sweet.
- Mm.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.927
Think they're still together?

11:18.970 --> 11:21.263
Probably not,
but...

11:21.304 --> 11:23.765
- Pessimist.
- Eh, realist.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.229
Everything cool?

11:28.269 --> 11:29.480
Hm?

11:29.522 --> 11:30.940
Phone call.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.774
Oh! Uh, yeah.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.275
No, yeah. Everything's...

11:34.317 --> 11:36.069
Why? Did I sound like I was-

11:36.111 --> 11:41.116
- No, just, uh, Checkin' in.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.653
Thanks.

12:18.696 --> 12:19.739
It was fun.

12:20.822 --> 12:21.656
Yeah.

12:28.788 --> 12:31.542
Let's get that
gas in your car.

12:42.761 --> 12:46.014
So, um, where are
you staying tonight?

12:46.057 --> 12:48.225
Don't know yet, actually.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.978
Do you have any
friends in town, or...

12:51.019 --> 12:52.145
Not anymore.

12:53.397 --> 12:55.107
Probably just bum it
at some cheap hotel.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.192
That sucks.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.695
It's just a couple nights.

12:59.736 --> 13:02.365
Look, I don't want this to
be weird or anything, but um,

13:02.405 --> 13:05.075
I mean, the person I was
staying with, he bailed on me

13:05.116 --> 13:07.077
last minute and I mean,
it is a two-bedroom,

13:07.119 --> 13:09.663
which obviously
you already know.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.791
I wasn't trying to
guilt you or anything.

13:11.831 --> 13:14.085
No, I know, and that's...

13:15.086 --> 13:16.836
That's why I offered.

13:20.924 --> 13:22.133
Are you sure?

13:24.845 --> 13:25.680
Yeah.

13:26.554 --> 13:29.391
Yeah, I mean, like I said.

13:29.432 --> 13:30.266
Jujitsu.

13:33.812 --> 13:34.646
Right.

13:37.649 --> 13:40.860
Okay, um, so
there's no mirror selfies

13:40.903 --> 13:42.779
or photos with fish, which
is good, it's a good start.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.825
I am immediately
regretting this.

13:45.865 --> 13:48.451
It's too late. Keep stirring.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.789
Okay, so it's, uh, it's not bad.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.335
It's not, it's just that, um...

13:57.294 --> 13:59.421
Your photos, they...

13:59.462 --> 14:02.716
I mean, your photos
have no personality.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.927
Ouch.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.262
You
asked for my help.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.430
Uh, I believe you
asked to help me.

14:08.471 --> 14:09.932
Um, I'm gonna need
a replay on that,

14:09.974 --> 14:11.517
because I'm pretty sure
you're the one who asked me-

14:11.558 --> 14:14.227
- Okay, okay, lead by example.

14:14.269 --> 14:15.770
Show me yours.

14:15.812 --> 14:18.274
Oh, I don't have one.

14:18.316 --> 14:19.774
Of course not.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.110
Hey, before you
question my credentials,

14:21.152 --> 14:22.235
I definitely used to.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.611
And did you delete
out of frustration,

14:23.653 --> 14:24.989
or because you found what
you were looking for?

14:25.030 --> 14:26.156
Also, follow-up question.

14:26.197 --> 14:29.869
Does he or does he not
have an eight-pack?

14:29.909 --> 14:31.870
We are not talking
about me right now,

14:31.912 --> 14:34.415
and you need to keep stirring.

14:41.839 --> 14:43.299
Uh-uh.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.426
Oh, my god, it's perfect.

14:45.467 --> 14:47.260
No, you have to upload this.
This is the first photo.

14:47.302 --> 14:49.388
- Absolutely not.
- What?

14:49.429 --> 14:50.805
Come on, personality!

14:50.847 --> 14:52.265
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

14:54.184 --> 14:57.270
- How's it looking?
- Uh, you tell me.

14:58.855 --> 15:01.274
Yeah, good.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.027
- Mm! Mm!
- Yeah?

15:03.068 --> 15:04.444
It's good, that
can go on the sheet.

15:04.486 --> 15:05.987
Okay.

15:06.029 --> 15:07.990
Also, where is your bio?

15:08.032 --> 15:10.283
Not worth the time.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.161
- Are you kidding?
- What am I supposed to do?

15:12.202 --> 15:13.663
Write the same shit
everybody else does?

15:13.703 --> 15:16.331
Do the sarcastic subversion
thing? That's sad.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.375
I mean, I don't
know, but you need something.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.336
- Says who?
- Um, your empty inbox.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.214
Ouch again!

15:23.254 --> 15:27.677
Look, just let me
write something for you.

15:27.717 --> 15:29.552
Just don't make it stupid.

15:29.595 --> 15:30.805
That's the spirit.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.181
Come on, this is
supposed to be fun.

15:32.222 --> 15:34.015
Was it fun for you?

15:35.058 --> 15:36.519
I mean, yeah.

15:36.559 --> 15:39.270
I just went on when I was
bored. It's like a game.

15:39.312 --> 15:40.730
Yeah, that's like
part of the problem.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.442
My therapist says that...
Sorry, is that weird?

15:43.484 --> 15:45.360
Therapy? No, therapy's cool.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.447
Cool, yeah, she says that
it's important to be intentional

15:48.489 --> 15:51.075
about this stuff, which like,
I agree with, but it's hard

15:51.116 --> 15:54.077
when it feels like my only
options are frivolous or forever.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.539
I mean, okay, so what
are you looking for?

15:57.581 --> 15:59.166
Something in between?

15:59.207 --> 16:00.918
Isn't everybody?

16:00.960 --> 16:04.379
Yes, I guess, but it does
not always feel that way.

16:04.422 --> 16:07.383
Okay, but that frustration's
not like exclusive to guys.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.884
No, it's not, you know,
it's just different.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.763
Like I've been in the inboxes
for some of my female friends.

16:12.804 --> 16:14.973
Like they've let me look
in some of their inboxes,

16:15.015 --> 16:19.352
and it's, um, different,
just like volume wise.

16:19.394 --> 16:23.649
- The total number of-
- Unsolicited dick pics?

16:23.691 --> 16:25.442
That's a thing?

16:25.484 --> 16:27.610
Yeah. You
want me to show you?

16:27.653 --> 16:28.903
You save them? Okay.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.239
Well, I mean, I've
screenshotted a few.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.573
- Only the winners, though.
- The winner?

16:31.615 --> 16:34.576
I don't know... Okay.

16:34.618 --> 16:35.828
Sorry, that's really shitty.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.788
Don't apologize for
something you didn't do.

16:37.830 --> 16:38.913
I'm just saying.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.416
I mean, performative
nice-guying

16:40.457 --> 16:41.875
is about as pervasive as
the dick pics themselves.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.628
Not what I'm doing. I'm
not doing any of that.

16:43.668 --> 16:46.338
Unless you blind-sighted
some poor, helpless female

16:46.379 --> 16:48.548
with your unsolicited...

16:48.591 --> 16:53.303
No, my you-know has not
blind-sighted any helpless female.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.514
I know. I'm just
busting your balls.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.644
Um... Let's get these
in the oven, yeah?

17:00.686 --> 17:01.479
Yeah.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.446
Broken femur from a skiing
accident's definitely a lie.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.490
That's way too specific.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.369
Don't look at my face!

17:16.410 --> 17:19.455
You're not getting
anything out of me.

17:20.830 --> 17:24.501
Fine, been in love
twice. Final answer, lie.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.002
You're wrong.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.464
Damn it. What was it?

17:28.506 --> 17:29.966
A skiing accident.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.009
It was my wrist, not my femur,
and I was seven, not eight.

17:32.050 --> 17:33.426
- That's cheating.
- How is it cheating?

17:33.469 --> 17:34.636
You know
exactly how it's cheating.

17:34.679 --> 17:35.805
I lied, didn't I?

17:35.846 --> 17:37.097
The half-lie is
very manipulative.

17:37.138 --> 17:40.475
That is why I'm undefeated.

17:43.770 --> 17:44.855
Twice, huh?

17:46.231 --> 17:47.316
Yeah.

17:47.357 --> 17:48.233
I think so.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.862
I mean, now I'm
curious, but...

17:51.903 --> 17:54.155
Well, if you must know...

17:58.451 --> 18:00.997
Okay, so first time
was in kindergarten.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.999
Recess.

18:03.039 --> 18:05.835
It was Halloween just
after the costume parade,

18:05.875 --> 18:08.336
and he was an astronaut,
I was a pumpkin.

18:08.378 --> 18:10.088
Oh, my god.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.340
I mean, he was
crazy decked out.

18:11.382 --> 18:12.842
Like, this wasn't the
Party City shit, okay?

18:12.883 --> 18:14.677
This was the real deal.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.804
Like his aunt must've worked
for NASA or something.

18:16.846 --> 18:20.516
And I'm in this puffy orange
thing that my mom made me,

18:20.557 --> 18:22.393
and I'm sitting on
the swings alone,

18:22.434 --> 18:25.812
and he comes over to me from
whatever game he's playing.

18:25.855 --> 18:29.107
He stares me dead in
the eyes and says,

18:30.276 --> 18:32.570
"I wish I looked
as cool as you."

18:34.363 --> 18:36.365
And just walks away.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.826
Total bad ass, like, he
just had to tell me that

18:38.867 --> 18:41.995
before he could keep playing.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.580
And that was it?

18:43.622 --> 18:45.416
Yeah, that was it.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.459
T.J. Bellis.

18:49.628 --> 18:50.795
That's love?

18:51.838 --> 18:53.506
Sure felt like it.

18:54.549 --> 18:56.469
You were five.

18:56.509 --> 18:57.345
And?

18:59.805 --> 19:02.892
And...

19:02.932 --> 19:03.893
Number two?

19:07.771 --> 19:10.732
That, my friend,
is classified.

19:10.775 --> 19:13.527
- Oh, come on.
- No, final answer.

19:13.568 --> 19:16.905
Fine, fine.

19:18.574 --> 19:19.408
And you?

19:20.617 --> 19:21.451
Hm?

19:23.328 --> 19:24.663
Love.

19:27.625 --> 19:31.170
Oh, um...

19:31.211 --> 19:33.547
- Sorry, I should go-
- Yeah, totally.

19:33.588 --> 19:35.383
Do you need
help cleaning up, or-

19:35.423 --> 19:36.716
- No, it's good. I got it.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.344
- Are you sure?
- It's like four cans.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.930
Okay.
I'll take this one.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.015
Um...

19:44.432 --> 19:47.103
- See you in the morning?
- Mm-hm.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.623
This is Blake.

20:07.664 --> 20:10.584
Hey, um, it's me.

20:11.624 --> 20:14.879
I saw your message and I
thought I'd give you a call.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.967
To say goodnight, or whatever.

20:18.009 --> 20:19.343
But no pressure.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.472
Just, we'll talk
when we talk. Um...

20:27.268 --> 20:30.770
Yeah, anyway...

20:30.813 --> 20:33.316
I hope you have a good night.

20:33.356 --> 20:35.859
Bye.

21:41.842 --> 21:44.220
- Oh, my god. Hi.
- What's up?

21:44.260 --> 21:46.888
- I thought you were working?
- I took the day off.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.057
Thought I'd surprise you.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.474
Wow, this is
really unexpected, I-

21:49.517 --> 21:51.394
- Well, you made such a big
thing about it. I figured-

21:51.434 --> 21:52.686
- No, I know, I
just didn't think

21:52.728 --> 21:54.605
that you'd actually
be able to come, so-

21:54.646 --> 21:58.858
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

22:02.028 --> 22:03.446
Morning.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.908
Morning. Hi, uh, I'm James.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.576
Blake.

22:08.618 --> 22:09.911
Who are... Who is this?

22:09.953 --> 22:12.080
James's family owns
the place and, um,

22:12.123 --> 22:13.164
there was a scheduling mix-up.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.293
He came up yesterday from...

22:15.334 --> 22:17.003
- Boston.
- Boston!

22:17.044 --> 22:18.254
"Boston?"

22:18.296 --> 22:20.965
Yeah, um, long story
short, he's super chill.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.592
So, I thought that it
made more sense for him to

22:23.634 --> 22:26.304
take the downstairs bedroom
than like blow money on a hotel.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.596
You know?

22:27.637 --> 22:28.471
Totally.

22:34.228 --> 22:37.815
Do you guys wants
breakfast, or...

22:37.856 --> 22:39.774
Look, it's just kinda weird.

22:39.817 --> 22:42.611
I know, but come
on. What was I supposed to do?

22:42.653 --> 22:44.572
Send his ass to the Marriott?

22:44.613 --> 22:46.865
Look, I didn't even
know that you were coming.

22:46.906 --> 22:49.617
Exactly. So what do you think
it was like walking into that?

22:49.660 --> 22:51.120
No, I know, but I told
you nothing happened.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.204
I know what you
said, but most guys-

22:53.247 --> 22:55.833
- What? Would've thought
that I sucked his dick?

22:55.875 --> 22:57.375
Don't be gross.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.377
Look, I just, I don't
see how it's any different

22:59.420 --> 23:01.547
than if I just rented a room
instead of the whole house.

23:01.588 --> 23:02.798
If you don't see the
difference between-

23:02.839 --> 23:04.634
- I didn't do anything wrong!
- Harper!

23:04.674 --> 23:06.009
I didn't come here to fight.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.346
I'm not,
I'm not fighting.

23:08.386 --> 23:11.389
I woke up at the
ass-crack of dawn,

23:11.432 --> 23:13.224
- just so I could beat traffic.
- I know.

23:13.267 --> 23:16.729
- To hang out with you.
- I know and I'm sorry.

23:16.770 --> 23:19.105
I'm really happy to see you.

23:20.273 --> 23:23.068
I'm really happy
that you're here.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.160
Blueberry or banana?

23:33.078 --> 23:35.623
Wow, that's a toughie.

23:35.664 --> 23:36.999
- Harper?
- Um...

23:38.209 --> 23:39.626
Blueberries cool?

23:42.837 --> 23:45.007
There's a maple tree
a few yards that way

23:45.048 --> 23:49.511
with a spigot on it if you
guys want the fresh stuff.

23:54.141 --> 23:57.144
Well, I never say
no to fresh sap.

23:59.230 --> 24:03.275
Pretty sure that's not
even how maple syrup works.

24:12.492 --> 24:14.077
It's really good, James.

24:14.119 --> 24:14.953
Thanks.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.373
Do you always
come with the place,

24:17.414 --> 24:19.125
- or did we just get lucky?
- Blake.

24:19.165 --> 24:21.876
What? No, this is some
serious bed and breakfast shit.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.129
I'm into it.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.715
Guess fortune
smiled.

24:25.756 --> 24:26.966
You sure the whole
scheduling mishap

24:27.008 --> 24:28.550
wasn't just a fun
way to say "hi?"

24:28.592 --> 24:30.386
Look, if it was, they'd
be losing a lot of money.

24:30.428 --> 24:33.973
James refunded the whole
stay, no questions asked.

24:34.015 --> 24:34.849
Good.

24:36.057 --> 24:38.394
What're, um, what're
you guys doing today?

24:38.435 --> 24:41.105
We are going on a run.
We're training for a half.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.314
Yeah, I used to
run in college.

24:42.355 --> 24:44.400
And I rented a boat
for the afternoon.

24:44.442 --> 24:46.277
- A boat?
- Sounds fun.

24:47.319 --> 24:48.153
Yeah.

24:49.739 --> 24:51.281
If you're looking for some
good trails, there are some

24:51.324 --> 24:52.991
great ones over at Coolidge
Homestead, it's the place-

24:53.034 --> 24:54.785
- Oh, yeah, the one that
you told me about yesterday

24:54.826 --> 24:57.121
after you came
back with the gas?

24:57.163 --> 24:58.788
- The gas?
- Yeah.

24:58.830 --> 25:01.375
Yeah, my car crapped out
right when I got here, so um,

25:01.416 --> 25:03.043
James played handyman
while I got settled.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.629
It was really nice.

25:05.546 --> 25:06.838
How chivalrous.

25:06.881 --> 25:10.551
Yeah, um, you know,
if you guys wanna bop,

25:11.969 --> 25:14.180
totally go for it, I'm gonna
be around for a little.

25:14.221 --> 25:15.722
If you need anything,
Harper, you have the-

25:15.765 --> 25:18.643
- Yeah, maybe you'll come
on the boat with us later?

25:18.683 --> 25:19.769
If there's room?

25:19.809 --> 25:21.436
Yeah, totally, possibly.

25:21.479 --> 25:23.480
I might be meeting
up with somebody, so-

25:23.521 --> 25:24.773
- I thought
you said everybody

25:24.815 --> 25:27.777
- you knew was out of town?
- They are.

25:27.817 --> 25:31.071
My friend just took this
new photo of me, I'm gonna

25:31.113 --> 25:33.574
try uploading to Tinder,
'cause they say the algorithms

25:33.615 --> 25:35.158
boost when you're out of
town, it's really stupid.

25:35.201 --> 25:38.537
Not stupid at all.
Appreciate the hustle, brother.

25:38.578 --> 25:41.289
Yeah, yeah. It's, uh...

25:41.332 --> 25:42.792
It's challenging.

25:59.432 --> 26:01.477
So I think it's
right down here?

26:01.519 --> 26:04.105
Yeah. It's like
the one way to go.

26:04.145 --> 26:06.941
Wanna do what,
an eighth today?

26:06.982 --> 26:08.317
Okay.

26:08.358 --> 26:09.943
- Ready?
- Right.

26:09.986 --> 26:12.278
- Let's go.
- I'll start us.

27:07.792 --> 27:08.627
Hey.

27:10.837 --> 27:13.214
Hey.

27:13.257 --> 27:14.091
Hey.

27:15.259 --> 27:16.469
Yeah.

27:16.509 --> 27:19.471
Yeah, we have like no service.

27:19.512 --> 27:22.265
Yeah, I'll be in tomorrow.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.977
We're all set for Friday.

27:25.019 --> 27:26.895
I told you, it's not an issue.

27:26.936 --> 27:27.771
Okay.

28:11.272 --> 28:12.107
Harper!

28:13.233 --> 28:14.734
Let's go! Come on!

28:26.497 --> 28:27.664
Yeah, I've been
up here since May,

28:27.707 --> 28:29.333
doing summer stock in Weston.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.710
We just closed the last show.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.961
My mom was a dancer, so...

28:33.003 --> 28:34.963
- I know the life, yeah.
- That is so cute!

28:35.006 --> 28:37.717
Did she like teach you how
to tap dance or something?

28:37.758 --> 28:38.968
She definitely tried,

28:39.009 --> 28:41.304
but my sister definitely
got most of that.

28:41.345 --> 28:44.097
And you have a sister? Cute.

28:44.140 --> 28:45.891
Is she like, is she
in the business too?

28:45.932 --> 28:48.019
Oh, no, she's in med school.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.519
God bless.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.314
Four years plus a
residency? No, thanks.

28:52.355 --> 28:53.816
Not for me.

28:53.857 --> 28:57.653
I just graduated BOCO and I'm
like ready to go, you know?

28:57.694 --> 28:58.987
I mean, a long
gig right of school,

28:59.029 --> 29:00.530
that's like really good, right?

29:00.573 --> 29:03.326
Yes, it's so blessed to have
those contracts. So grateful.

29:03.366 --> 29:04.576
But at the same time,

29:04.617 --> 29:06.995
I'm also so ready to
be back in the city.

29:07.038 --> 29:09.539
Four weeks with the same
people, it kinda make you crazy.

29:09.582 --> 29:11.584
I mean, I can imagine.

29:13.419 --> 29:18.424
So, your profile says you're
just here for the weekend?

29:19.549 --> 29:21.551
Yeah, uh, quick
trip. In and out, yeah.

29:21.594 --> 29:22.928
Yeah, totally.

29:24.055 --> 29:27.892
I'm leaving tomorrow.

29:34.565 --> 29:36.025
Yeah, there's
like no pressure.

29:36.067 --> 29:37.276
I don't want you to feel like
you have to do anything, or-

29:37.317 --> 29:38.818
- I haven't gotten
laid all summer.

29:38.861 --> 29:41.405
12 gays, two straight guys
and 19 horny chorus girls.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.530
Do the math.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.953
Damn, dude. Must've
been a good pic.

29:48.996 --> 29:50.413
Oh.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.375
Hi! I'm Alison.

29:52.415 --> 29:53.875
- Blake.
- Harper.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.127
Sorry, um, I neglected to
mention this is an Airbnb.

29:56.170 --> 29:57.587
- I mean, it's my house, but-
- Parents' house.

29:57.630 --> 29:59.548
Right, parents' house. Sorry.

29:59.589 --> 30:02.467
This is, uh, a
scheduling mix-up.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.386
We're all staying here now.
I'm sorry if that's weird.

30:04.428 --> 30:06.055
Do you know how many
housemates I had this summer?

30:06.096 --> 30:09.182
It's nothing. I was doing
summer stock in Weston.

30:09.224 --> 30:10.892
Oh, damn. Sign
me up.

30:10.934 --> 30:13.561
- Are you union?
- I have no idea.

30:13.604 --> 30:15.815
Well, auditions are
always cutthroat, but,

30:15.855 --> 30:17.732
you have a real leading
man vibe to you.

30:17.775 --> 30:19.735
So you'd definitely get
through the initial type-out.

30:19.777 --> 30:21.069
I thought you guys
were renting a boat?

30:21.112 --> 30:22.529
- Oh, we love boats.
- Me too!

30:22.570 --> 30:23.738
- Me too.
- Yeah, boats are cool.

30:23.780 --> 30:24.781
Sorry, I just didn't realize

30:24.824 --> 30:26.033
you guys were gonna
be back so soon.

30:26.075 --> 30:27.410
I wanted to change.

30:27.451 --> 30:29.370
Oh, and James, don't forget.

30:29.412 --> 30:32.414
That offer I made at
breakfast? Still stands.

30:32.455 --> 30:33.707
What offer?

30:33.749 --> 30:35.459
Join us
on the boat, my man.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.752
We've got an eight-person
bowrider. Plenty of room.

30:37.795 --> 30:39.422
That sounds so fun!

30:39.462 --> 30:40.673
So fun.

30:40.714 --> 30:42.257
Come on, what
do you say, Jimmy?

30:42.299 --> 30:44.009
How about a little
maritime adventure?

30:44.050 --> 30:45.385
I didn't know
that was your nickname.

30:45.428 --> 30:46.429
It's not.

30:53.310 --> 30:54.936
This thing goes to 45?

30:54.979 --> 30:56.771
Yeah, it's a
super-charged engine.

30:56.814 --> 30:58.941
Last week, I pushed
her up to 48.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.358
Awesome.

31:00.401 --> 31:01.610
If you want, later, I'll
be happy to let you drive.

31:01.652 --> 31:02.903
Ah, I don't know.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.404
I might crash us into somethin'.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.072
Ah, it's not that hard.

31:06.115 --> 31:07.825
He is such a boy.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.201
Yeah, yeah. Mopeds,
ATVs, dirt bikes.

31:10.243 --> 31:12.078
It's kind of his thing.

31:12.121 --> 31:13.663
Lucky you.

31:13.705 --> 31:16.791
Yeah. Yeah, he's somethin'.

31:16.834 --> 31:18.669
Do you ride, James?

31:18.711 --> 31:22.923
I had an electric
scooter when I was a kid.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.716
You know, being out here on
the water really reminds me

31:24.759 --> 31:27.636
of my production of "Anything
Goes," I played Hope-

31:27.678 --> 31:28.846
- Hey, Blake?

31:28.887 --> 31:31.182
- What?
- Could you get me a beer?

31:31.222 --> 31:32.892
- You want?
- No, I'm good, thanks.

31:32.932 --> 31:34.727
Those days are kinda
long gone for me

31:34.769 --> 31:37.395
and I think I wanna keep my
boating license, but you know,

31:37.438 --> 31:39.482
you guys have a good
time this afternoon.

31:39.522 --> 31:40.690
Oh, we will.

31:42.777 --> 31:44.612
- All right.
- Thank you.

31:46.154 --> 31:49.200
All right. What
should we toast to?

31:50.159 --> 31:50.951
To life!

31:52.411 --> 31:54.038
To life.

31:54.079 --> 31:57.165
James, I gotta tell you,
you found a good one here.

31:57.208 --> 31:58.000
To life.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.881
You know what? I'm
gonna go for a swim.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.340
James.

32:05.383 --> 32:06.467
Hold my beer.

32:11.096 --> 32:12.514
Harper, come on. Let's go.

32:12.556 --> 32:14.976
Oh, I didn't bring my suit.

32:16.477 --> 32:18.980
Harper, we're on a boat.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.271
Why didn't you bring
your bathing suit?

32:20.314 --> 32:22.441
I didn't bring
mine either, so...

32:22.482 --> 32:24.985
James, we're on a boat.

32:25.027 --> 32:26.403
Why didn't you bring
your bathing suit?

32:26.444 --> 32:27.445
I'll swim.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.490
Did you remember to
bring your bathing suit?

32:30.532 --> 32:32.867
No, but I don't care.

32:35.037 --> 32:35.871
Harper?

32:36.788 --> 32:38.915
Yeah. Sorry, I do care.

32:40.334 --> 32:41.585
James?

32:41.626 --> 32:42.794
Yeah, no, sorry,
I'm way too drunk.

32:42.836 --> 32:44.212
So, yeah.

32:44.255 --> 32:46.257
Suit yourself.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.634
- Be safe, Blake.
- Always.

32:50.970 --> 32:54.597
- You ready?
- So ready.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.642
You're cool with getting
everything wet, right?

32:56.683 --> 32:58.810
- Yeah.
- Its gonna be pretty deep.

32:58.853 --> 33:01.063
All right, so on three,
we're gonna jump in.

33:01.105 --> 33:03.190
Okay, wait,
on three or on go?

33:03.231 --> 33:04.692
On three.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.484
I'm gonna count to three and
then we're gonna jump in.

33:06.527 --> 33:08.069
Oh, my god. Okay.

33:08.112 --> 33:09.196
One.

33:09.238 --> 33:10.405
- Two.
- Two!

33:10.448 --> 33:11.824
- Three.
- Three!

33:18.122 --> 33:19.914
I got scared!

33:19.957 --> 33:21.584
Oh!

33:23.544 --> 33:26.339
Come here! I got ya.

33:30.217 --> 33:31.886
Did you feel that?

33:31.926 --> 33:34.012
What was that?

33:40.769 --> 33:42.355
That wasn't me.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.190
- That was not me.
- You're so annoying.

33:44.230 --> 33:47.817
It's the truth.

33:50.445 --> 33:52.322
You're not sorry.

33:52.365 --> 33:55.159
You wanna play a game?

33:55.201 --> 33:56.786
First, get over here.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.081
To life.

34:01.123 --> 34:02.333
Try and
stand on my hands.

34:05.001 --> 34:08.338
It appears your
master plan worked.

34:08.381 --> 34:10.132
Yeah, a little
too well, apparently.

34:10.173 --> 34:12.134
What did
you put in my bio?

34:12.175 --> 34:14.427
"Here for a good
time, not a long time.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.680
- Catch me if you can."
- That's objectively terrible.

34:16.722 --> 34:19.100
- Clearly not.
- What does that even mean?

34:19.141 --> 34:20.559
Well, that's the
beauty of it, right?

34:20.601 --> 34:23.813
It's the ambiguity. Is it music
lyrics, a movie reference?

34:23.853 --> 34:25.814
A thinly veiled way of saying

34:25.856 --> 34:27.608
that you're time
in town is limited

34:27.650 --> 34:29.818
and you're looking to
copulate and make it count.

34:29.860 --> 34:31.903
Option C is
definitely the inference

34:31.945 --> 34:33.780
that she made about me.

34:33.822 --> 34:37.326
Oh.

34:37.367 --> 34:38.911
Sorry, it's my dad.

34:41.454 --> 34:42.288
Dad, hey.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.542
Harper, how are you, sweetie?

34:45.583 --> 34:48.295
Pretty, pretty good, yeah.

34:48.336 --> 34:50.338
Where are you?
It looks beautiful.

34:50.380 --> 34:53.466
Oh, um, yeah, it's Lake Echo.

34:53.509 --> 34:56.554
Let me give you the
full view, so um,

34:56.594 --> 34:59.889
over there is
where the house is.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.600
And then the sunset is
gonna be back over this way.

35:02.643 --> 35:04.019
Who's that?

35:04.061 --> 35:05.354
Oh! Um, it's-

35:05.396 --> 35:07.648
- Hi! I'm
Neil, Harper's dad.

35:07.690 --> 35:09.066
It's not him, Dad.

35:09.108 --> 35:10.359
Sweetie, I thought
you said he wasn't coming?

35:10.400 --> 35:13.028
Yeah, yeah, it's not
him and he can hear you.

35:13.070 --> 35:14.071
Oh.

35:15.405 --> 35:17.199
Who's he, then?

35:17.240 --> 35:18.534
He's just a friend.

35:18.576 --> 35:20.036
It's good to meet
you anyway, sir.

35:20.077 --> 35:22.038
Likewise.

35:22.079 --> 35:24.081
When do I get to meet
this guy, Harper?

35:24.123 --> 35:26.791
I don't know. When it
feels like something?

35:26.833 --> 35:28.418
Well, it's
been six months.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.003
Yeah and very inconsistent.

35:30.045 --> 35:33.548
Listen, Dad, I can't talk
about this right now, okay?

35:33.590 --> 35:35.467
Fine. Sorry to press.

35:35.509 --> 35:36.969
- It's fine.
- I just...

35:37.010 --> 35:40.514
Look, I know and I love
you for it, but I gotta go.

35:40.556 --> 35:43.559
- Enjoy the water.
- Okay, love you.

35:43.601 --> 35:44.434
Bye, Dad.

35:48.481 --> 35:50.149
He seems cool.

35:50.190 --> 35:51.024
He is.

35:56.364 --> 35:58.449
So you and Blake, uh...

36:01.284 --> 36:02.952
Sorry if I'm getting in
the way of the weekend,

36:02.994 --> 36:04.079
or whatever this
is supposed to be.

36:04.121 --> 36:08.501
No, it's
fine, he...

36:08.541 --> 36:10.670
He seems to enjoy the company.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.778
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

37:59.820 --> 38:00.905
No problem.

38:02.739 --> 38:03.573
Oh!

38:05.076 --> 38:06.242
You don't
have to do that.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.869
Just in case
the guys come out.

38:07.911 --> 38:12.707
Oh, I mean, not like he's
not gonna see it later anyway.

38:12.750 --> 38:15.710
James, I mean.

38:18.630 --> 38:19.923
What?

38:19.965 --> 38:21.549
Oh, it's just funny.

38:21.592 --> 38:22.927
What's funny?

38:22.969 --> 38:26.554
Me, you, this porch,
Vermont. Like, what?

38:27.722 --> 38:30.643
Totally.
It's like fate.

38:32.103 --> 38:34.063
Yeah or like
completely random, right?

38:34.105 --> 38:36.898
I mean, I didn't even know
who you were six hours ago,

38:36.940 --> 38:39.526
and now a couple
of algorithms on some apps's

38:39.568 --> 38:42.947
just made it happen, but
I mean, after tomorrow,

38:42.989 --> 38:44.907
it's not like we're ever
gonna see each other again

38:44.949 --> 38:47.827
or remember each other's names
or that this ever happened.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.619
Oh, don't say that!

38:51.329 --> 38:53.164
What's your Instagram?

38:57.878 --> 38:59.171
She's hot, man.

38:59.213 --> 39:01.507
- Hm?
- Tinder chick, Ali?

39:01.548 --> 39:03.217
- Solid seven.
- We're just hanging out.

39:03.259 --> 39:05.302
That's
the way to be.

39:05.344 --> 39:07.637
Can't take 'em too serious.

39:09.306 --> 39:11.224
I thought you were
kind of a simp this morning,

39:11.266 --> 39:14.019
but you're actually
pretty chill.

39:14.894 --> 39:16.105
Thank you.

39:16.146 --> 39:18.690
Listen, I'm
gonna help you out.

39:18.733 --> 39:21.318
- How?
- I'm gonna wing-man for ya.

39:21.360 --> 39:25.030
Get her juices
flowin'. Hang tight.

39:31.119 --> 39:31.953
Ladies.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.539
Wanna play a game?

39:34.581 --> 39:36.291
What kind of game?

39:36.333 --> 39:38.418
Come in, I'll show you.

39:50.306 --> 39:51.139
This...

39:52.432 --> 39:53.434
Is Paranoia.

39:56.228 --> 39:59.398
One by one, we'll go
around in a circle,

39:59.440 --> 40:01.400
and when it's your turn,
you'll pick someone,

40:01.442 --> 40:03.902
and ask them a "who" question.

40:03.943 --> 40:05.362
A "who" question?

40:05.403 --> 40:09.532
Yeah. Like, "who here
lost their virginity last?"

40:10.701 --> 40:13.204
Or, who do you think
is into butt stuff?

40:13.244 --> 40:14.788
Seriously?

40:14.829 --> 40:15.914
It's an example.

40:15.956 --> 40:17.708
- I got it.
- Good.

40:17.750 --> 40:19.585
And then the person will answer.

40:19.626 --> 40:23.255
But no one else will
know what was asked.

40:23.297 --> 40:25.382
So if you wanna find out,

40:26.509 --> 40:28.510
you have to take a shot.

40:31.972 --> 40:34.432
Who wants to go first?

40:43.192 --> 40:43.985
Me it is.

40:45.235 --> 40:46.027
Eenie.

40:46.903 --> 40:47.737
Meenie.

40:49.072 --> 40:53.201
Minie.

40:53.244 --> 40:54.036
Moe.

41:07.842 --> 41:08.675
Go on.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.054
It's a tough one.

41:13.097 --> 41:16.600
Well, there's only four
of us to choose from.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.226
Can I pick myself?

41:18.268 --> 41:23.273
Yeah, if you
think that's the answer.

41:23.898 --> 41:24.817
Then...

41:24.858 --> 41:26.110
Yeah.

41:26.152 --> 41:27.570
Me.

41:27.610 --> 41:28.653
That's hot.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.286
All right. Your turn.

41:38.456 --> 41:39.289
Uh...

41:41.458 --> 41:42.292
James.

42:02.146 --> 42:02.938
Blake.

42:10.195 --> 42:12.906
You don't wanna know?

42:12.947 --> 42:15.492
I already know who he thinks
has the biggest dick, so...

42:21.748 --> 42:24.250
Does that mean it's my turn?

42:44.313 --> 42:45.481
Interesting.

42:47.483 --> 42:48.317
Alison.

42:49.402 --> 42:50.318
Definitely.

42:52.697 --> 42:55.700
Oh, damn it.

43:04.625 --> 43:07.378
Tell me.

43:10.672 --> 43:13.091
I asked who you think is most
likely to cheat on someone.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.846
Okay, it was sophomore year
and he was really boring.

43:16.887 --> 43:18.806
Hey, no judgment
here. We're all people.

43:18.847 --> 43:21.891
Yeah, I mean,
anything goes, right?

43:24.603 --> 43:28.065
The musical you were
in, I was referencing-

43:28.106 --> 43:31.527
- Oh.

43:31.568 --> 43:34.070
All right. Alison,
you're up again.

43:34.112 --> 43:36.031
No, let Harper go. She
hasn't had a turn yet.

43:36.072 --> 43:37.615
Oh, no, I'm good.

43:38.784 --> 43:40.369
No, she's right.

43:40.411 --> 43:43.079
Harper, come on. Ask a question.

43:45.750 --> 43:46.583
Okay.

44:09.023 --> 44:10.191
You, Harper.

44:38.177 --> 44:39.010
Well?

44:42.514 --> 44:43.932
She asked who do I think-

44:43.974 --> 44:47.478
- I asked "who do you
think is hiding something?"

44:55.068 --> 44:56.820
Time for round two.

44:58.364 --> 45:00.324
Which means two shots,

45:00.365 --> 45:04.202
and we're moving on to
"yes" or "no" questions.

45:25.974 --> 45:26.808
You would?

45:27.851 --> 45:28.685
Yeah.

45:29.811 --> 45:30.645
I would.

45:42.782 --> 45:44.117
Let's hear it.

45:45.536 --> 45:47.621
I asked her if she would
give up sex for a year,

45:47.663 --> 45:50.166
- to be on Broadway.
- It's my dream.

45:51.375 --> 45:52.501
Honestly, Harper.

45:52.543 --> 45:56.047
I don't know what you're
so paranoid about.

45:58.715 --> 45:59.967
It's my turn.

46:03.054 --> 46:04.639
Oh, two in a row.

46:10.518 --> 46:11.686
Yeah.

46:11.728 --> 46:12.562
I do.

46:17.150 --> 46:21.739
Oh, come on, James. You
gotta ask her about that one.

46:22.907 --> 46:24.033
All right.

46:24.074 --> 46:25.492
Fine, I'll do it.

46:32.583 --> 46:33.709
One.

46:37.338 --> 46:39.382
Two.

46:39.422 --> 46:40.715
She asked me if
I thought James

46:40.757 --> 46:42.384
was gonna sleep with me tonight.

46:42.425 --> 46:46.429
Oh-hoo! Making friends
real quick around here.

46:48.264 --> 46:50.600
You drank, it's your turn.

47:00.695 --> 47:01.528
What?

47:02.737 --> 47:05.490
- Do you need me to repeat the question?
- Why would you ask me that?

47:05.532 --> 47:08.368
It's Paranoia, James. Answer.

47:08.411 --> 47:09.869
- Haven't thought about it.
- So think about.

47:09.911 --> 47:11.454
- That's my answer.
- Eh, that's not an answer.

47:11.496 --> 47:14.666
My answer is I
don't have an answer.

47:20.840 --> 47:22.133
Aggressive.

47:22.173 --> 47:23.259
Harper, that's like
four shots in two minutes.

47:23.300 --> 47:24.175
- I'm fine.
- She's fine.

47:24.217 --> 47:25.635
What'd he ask?

47:25.677 --> 47:27.179
It's not, it doesn't matter.

47:27.221 --> 47:29.056
I asked him who he felt
was hotter. You or Alison.

47:29.097 --> 47:31.224
What? That's not even
a "yes" or "no" question.

47:31.266 --> 47:33.852
- Oops.
- Why did you have to think about it? No offense.

47:33.893 --> 47:35.312
Why are we doing this?

47:35.353 --> 47:37.647
'Cause it's fun. Aren't
you having fun, James?

47:37.690 --> 47:39.108
- I'm having fun.
- See? She's having fun.

47:39.150 --> 47:40.318
Can I ask a question?

47:40.358 --> 47:43.362
Technically it's
Harper's turn.

47:43.403 --> 47:46.699
No, it's okay, James. Go
ahead, ask your question.

47:46.740 --> 47:48.909
So you're forgoing your turn?

47:48.951 --> 47:50.619
Yeah, I'm forgoing my turn.

47:50.661 --> 47:52.288
Another wasted
opportunity, but hey-

47:52.329 --> 47:53.496
- What the fuck does that mean?

47:53.539 --> 47:55.625
- Relax. You're embarrassing-
- "Relax?"

47:55.666 --> 47:57.335
Stop.

47:57.376 --> 48:00.171
- James, it's your turn, bud.
- Oh, my god!

48:02.213 --> 48:03.048
Yes.

48:32.202 --> 48:35.581
You know, I don't know
if you wanna know.

48:35.623 --> 48:39.626
My impending hangover
would suggest otherwise.

48:42.880 --> 48:46.092
He asked if I was
tired of this game.

48:50.846 --> 48:53.099
I don't think that's
what he asked you.

48:53.139 --> 48:55.141
Well, it is, and I am.

49:02.775 --> 49:03.567
James?

49:10.074 --> 49:12.326
Yeah, I guess
Paranoia's not a misnomer.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.422
You still tired?

51:25.083 --> 51:26.751
- Morning.
- Morning.

51:29.005 --> 51:30.506
- Good night?
- Yeah.

51:31.548 --> 51:33.175
You?

51:33.217 --> 51:34.050
Yeah.

51:54.280 --> 51:55.364
Bye.

51:55.405 --> 51:58.366
- See you in the city?
- Mm-hm.

51:58.409 --> 52:01.287
By the way,
cookies are overdone.

52:03.496 --> 52:04.789
Hey.

52:04.831 --> 52:08.043
Thank you so much,
I had so much fun.

52:08.085 --> 52:09.753
You're so welcome.

52:09.795 --> 52:12.965
And remember,
I'm @allycat88_3.

52:13.007 --> 52:15.217
Yeah, did you see
James this morning?

52:15.259 --> 52:17.052
Oh, he wasn't
here when I woke up.

52:17.094 --> 52:17.927
Oh.

52:19.096 --> 52:20.889
His loss, right?

52:20.931 --> 52:22.682
Yeah, totally.

52:23.809 --> 52:25.478
- Shuttle's leaving!
- Coming!

52:25.518 --> 52:26.770
I thought you
were taking an Uber?

52:26.811 --> 52:28.563
Oh, he said he was
passing the station.

52:28.606 --> 52:30.441
Summer stock doesn't
really pay, so...

52:31.442 --> 52:32.275
Toodles!

52:36.030 --> 52:36.864
Hey.

53:45.724 --> 53:48.018
Quite the itinerary.

53:48.059 --> 53:50.730
Yeah, it's uh,
subject to change.

53:50.771 --> 53:52.815
I just figured I'd leave a
roadmap of my whereabouts,

53:52.856 --> 53:54.650
- in case you got bored.
- Oh.

53:54.692 --> 53:55.985
You know, you could
just leave your number,

53:56.027 --> 53:56.860
like a normal person.

53:56.902 --> 53:59.237
Yeah, I kinda get in my head

53:59.280 --> 54:04.201
when I'm hoping someone's
gonna text me back, so...

54:05.077 --> 54:06.037
So you slipped out early.

54:06.077 --> 54:07.079
Just quietly.

54:08.873 --> 54:10.041
Blake leave?

54:10.081 --> 54:13.001
Yeah. Yeah, about
a half-hour ago?

54:15.880 --> 54:18.132
Alison said you left
without saying goodbye.

54:18.173 --> 54:21.635
Yeah, we're uh, now in the
latter stages of the texting,

54:21.677 --> 54:23.554
chilling and ghosting cycle, so-

54:23.596 --> 54:25.389
- Oh, I know it well.

54:27.474 --> 54:29.893
Victim or perpetrator?

54:29.934 --> 54:31.353
Totally, right on. Love it.

54:31.394 --> 54:32.855
- Shut up.
- Awesome. What?

54:32.896 --> 54:34.356
You literally just said
you did the same thing.

54:34.398 --> 54:36.317
Did not literally say it,
did not figuratively say it.

54:36.358 --> 54:39.277
No, I did not and if I did,
it'd be totally irrelevant.

54:39.320 --> 54:40.696
How is it irrelevant?

54:40.737 --> 54:41.780
We're not talking about
me, we're talking about you.

54:41.822 --> 54:43.407
- You're so...
- Hm?

54:43.449 --> 54:45.034
So...

54:48.913 --> 54:49.746
What?

54:59.090 --> 55:02.175
I wanna know more
things about you.

55:05.679 --> 55:07.138
That'd be cool.

55:15.648 --> 55:18.401
I used to think being in
my 20s would feel so adult,

55:18.442 --> 55:19.735
put together, you know?

55:19.777 --> 55:23.239
But really, you just
realize more and more

55:23.280 --> 55:24.865
how little you know about life.

55:24.907 --> 55:27.702
It's inherently upsetting.

55:27.742 --> 55:29.577
And what's worse is
you know there are people

55:29.619 --> 55:31.163
who pretend like
that's not how it is.

55:31.204 --> 55:33.498
Like the girl who cheated off
my little sister in pre-calc

55:33.541 --> 55:36.794
is bragging about baby number
two and her forever-home

55:36.835 --> 55:39.879
on Facebook, like give
me a break.

55:39.922 --> 55:41.923
Sorry, you're
still on Facebook?

55:41.965 --> 55:42.717
Shut up.

55:44.969 --> 55:45.802
Oh, wow.

55:47.847 --> 55:48.848
I miss this.

55:54.436 --> 55:57.105
What do you do with all those?

55:58.481 --> 56:01.485
I used to print 'em out and
put 'em in albums, but uh,

56:01.527 --> 56:04.780
I haven't really shot for
myself in my while, so-

56:04.822 --> 56:05.990
- Why?

56:07.699 --> 56:11.286
I'm not sure if
I love it anymore.

56:11.329 --> 56:13.706
- Something change?
- Uh, yeah.

56:13.748 --> 56:15.875
Turned into work.

56:15.916 --> 56:17.626
- Like professionally?
- Yeah.

56:17.668 --> 56:19.961
Yeah, I shoot weddings.

56:20.003 --> 56:22.339
That's cool.

56:22.380 --> 56:23.715
It used to be.

56:25.175 --> 56:29.304
I mean, it's gotta be better
than my nine-to-five, right?

56:30.889 --> 56:32.349
It's a template.

56:32.391 --> 56:35.101
It's the same eight poses
in the same three positions,

56:35.143 --> 56:36.978
twice a week, every week, so-

56:37.021 --> 56:40.274
- May have spoken too soon
about you not being jaded.

56:40.315 --> 56:42.692
I don't know, I'd say numb.

56:44.320 --> 56:46.989
I stand in a corner,
capturing identical memories,

56:47.030 --> 56:48.699
over and over and over again.

56:48.740 --> 56:52.494
The only thing that changes
is the flower arrangement.

56:52.536 --> 56:55.498
Could do something else.

56:55.539 --> 56:58.042
It's too late for me, James.

57:01.878 --> 57:04.798
Anyway, I had a
professor tell me once that, um,

57:04.840 --> 57:06.509
she didn't teach
because she loved it.

57:06.550 --> 57:10.680
She taught because she was
good at it and tenured.

57:10.721 --> 57:13.641
That's rough.

57:13.682 --> 57:16.184
Yeah, I don't know.

57:16.226 --> 57:19.646
It used to not make
sense to me, but now?

57:26.862 --> 57:28.655
What about Blake?

57:28.697 --> 57:29.531
Hm?

57:31.074 --> 57:33.785
You said you've been
in love twice, just uh,

57:33.827 --> 57:35.579
is he the second one?

57:37.331 --> 57:38.791
I don't see what
this have to do with-

57:38.833 --> 57:43.296
- Is he love or is he tenure
was the intended question.

57:45.088 --> 57:47.549
Both, neither? I don't...

57:47.590 --> 57:48.634
I don't know.

57:52.722 --> 57:55.516
Sorry, I'm not trying to put
you on the spot or anything.

57:55.557 --> 57:58.436
- I mean, you kind of are.
- I...

57:58.476 --> 58:01.938
Just wondering. You
don't have to answer.

58:08.987 --> 58:11.614
I guess it's not a bad thing.

59:17.597 --> 59:19.599
You're welcome. Enjoy.

59:20.518 --> 59:21.894
Hello.

59:21.936 --> 59:25.690
- Are you all set?
- Yeah, this is for me.

59:25.731 --> 59:28.317
Would you like ice cream?

59:28.358 --> 59:33.322
Uh, yeah.
That would be great.

59:52.048 --> 59:54.050
Okay, rotate a bit?

59:54.092 --> 59:56.469
- Okay.
- No, sorry, towards me?

59:56.512 --> 59:59.849
- Towards you. Stupid.
- Yes. No, that's perfect.

59:59.889 --> 1:00:01.016
Still don't think
it's gonna work.

1:00:01.057 --> 1:00:02.226
Look, I really
think it's gonna help,

1:00:02.268 --> 1:00:04.186
and I'm not charging,
so what's the harm?

1:00:04.228 --> 1:00:05.855
Not really
photogenic, you know.

1:00:05.896 --> 1:00:07.440
Yeah, the one I
took on Friday worked.

1:00:07.481 --> 1:00:09.692
- Okay, thank you for that.
- Just fine.

1:00:09.733 --> 1:00:10.860
Okay.

1:00:10.900 --> 1:00:12.694
Have a little faith.

1:00:12.737 --> 1:00:14.238
You still
wanna eat this stuff?

1:00:14.280 --> 1:00:16.699
Uh, yeah, we're not
wasting perfectly good bread.

1:00:16.740 --> 1:00:18.034
Okay.

1:00:18.074 --> 1:00:20.577
All right, now one together.

1:00:21.661 --> 1:00:23.788
- Like me and you?
- Yeah.

1:00:23.831 --> 1:00:25.750
- How?
- I have a timer.

1:00:26.916 --> 1:00:28.877
- What will we do?
- There we go.

1:00:28.918 --> 1:00:31.087
All right. Oh, eight seconds,
eight seconds, hurry!

1:00:31.130 --> 1:00:32.590
- Uh, feed me, James.
- Baguette?

1:00:32.632 --> 1:00:34.090
- Mm, grape!
- Okay.

1:00:34.132 --> 1:00:35.675
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
We have like three seconds!

1:00:35.717 --> 1:00:37.219
Go, go, go, eat it.

1:00:37.260 --> 1:00:39.262
That was stupid.

1:00:39.304 --> 1:00:40.639
I'm gonna see.

1:00:42.766 --> 1:00:43.643
No, it's perfect.

1:00:43.684 --> 1:00:45.102
- It's perfect?
- Mm-hm.

1:00:45.143 --> 1:00:47.354
- Why did we do that?
- It brings it all to life.

1:00:47.396 --> 1:00:49.398
Otherwise, you're just a
lonely boy cutting a baguette.

1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:53.235
Wow, I feel seen.

1:00:53.277 --> 1:00:55.362
Look, we want people to sense
the potential of this place.

1:00:55.403 --> 1:00:57.489
Right? The romance.

1:00:57.530 --> 1:00:59.909
People's imaginations are way
more stunted than you think.

1:00:59.949 --> 1:01:01.743
I don't think I've ever
seen editorial photos

1:01:01.786 --> 1:01:05.331
- for an Airbnb before.
- Well, you can be the first.

1:01:05.373 --> 1:01:08.708
If the photos we have are so
uninspired, why did you book?

1:01:08.751 --> 1:01:10.544
I don't know.

1:01:10.585 --> 1:01:13.630
First impressions aren't
really a deal-breaker for me.

1:01:13.672 --> 1:01:15.674
But I'm weird like that.

1:01:21.304 --> 1:01:23.264
That one's just for me.

1:01:24.599 --> 1:01:26.559
When I was a kid and I
got a crush on somebody,

1:01:26.601 --> 1:01:29.437
it was like all-consuming.

1:01:29.480 --> 1:01:30.773
I remember this
one summer at camp,

1:01:30.815 --> 1:01:32.608
I found out she liked me too,

1:01:32.650 --> 1:01:35.610
and it was like,
I was paralyzed.

1:01:35.652 --> 1:01:37.404
Like instantaneously nauseous.

1:01:37.445 --> 1:01:38.947
Wait, why?

1:01:38.989 --> 1:01:41.950
Uh, I just hadn't thought
about what happened next.

1:01:41.992 --> 1:01:44.244
Like, what I had to do now.

1:01:46.831 --> 1:01:49.709
That's kind of adorable.

1:01:49.750 --> 1:01:51.626
I mean, that's just
how it is, right?

1:01:51.668 --> 1:01:53.712
Even now, people start
questioning everything

1:01:53.753 --> 1:01:55.380
when shit gets real.

1:01:56.923 --> 1:01:59.134
I don't know, I mean,

1:01:59.175 --> 1:02:03.179
statistically speaking, it's
way safer to date people

1:02:03.222 --> 1:02:07.560
that you don't actually
want in your life forever.

1:02:07.601 --> 1:02:11.814
You're gonna have to
break that one down for me.

1:02:11.856 --> 1:02:13.107
Um...

1:02:14.442 --> 1:02:15.860
Oh.

1:02:15.900 --> 1:02:17.485
Sorry, I thought
I had a full battery.

1:02:17.527 --> 1:02:19.237
Just plug it in.
There's an outlet over there.

1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:21.824
Yeah, it doesn't play
when it's plugged in, so,

1:02:21.865 --> 1:02:23.909
it's okay, I'll just
do it off the phone.

1:02:23.951 --> 1:02:25.619
Uh, hold on a sec.

1:02:27.579 --> 1:02:28.413
One sec.

1:02:51.603 --> 1:02:54.064
All right, screw it.

1:02:54.106 --> 1:02:55.566
- Is that-
- Yeah.

1:02:55.608 --> 1:02:58.736
- Are those-
- You're blind.

1:02:58.777 --> 1:03:00.904
- You wanna do this?
- Yeah.

1:03:00.945 --> 1:03:02.030
Are you sure?

1:03:02.072 --> 1:03:04.282
- Almost.
- You don't have to.

1:03:04.324 --> 1:03:07.577
We're just gonna
listen to the B-side.

1:03:18.713 --> 1:03:21.299
Okay, um, next one is,

1:03:21.342 --> 1:03:23.385
"share what you see as
positive characteristics

1:03:23.427 --> 1:03:27.556
of your partner,
alternate, three for each."

1:03:27.597 --> 1:03:30.058
I think that you are very good

1:03:30.101 --> 1:03:31.394
at diffusing awkward situations.

1:03:31.434 --> 1:03:33.061
Thought it was my
turn to go first.

1:03:33.103 --> 1:03:34.562
Just slipped out.

1:03:34.605 --> 1:03:36.065
Must've been thinking
about it already.

1:03:36.106 --> 1:03:40.652
You've doing a fair amount
of it this weekend, so...

1:03:40.695 --> 1:03:42.238
All right, your turn.

1:03:42.278 --> 1:03:45.574
Tell me how awesome I am.

1:03:45.615 --> 1:03:46.449
Um...

1:03:47.784 --> 1:03:50.745
I think that you're
genuinely kind.

1:03:54.666 --> 1:03:57.420
That's better than mine.

1:03:57.460 --> 1:03:58.837
You also have nice
eyes and good taste

1:03:58.878 --> 1:04:00.338
in late 2000s sad boy music.

1:04:00.380 --> 1:04:01.882
I thought we were
supposed to alternate?

1:04:01.923 --> 1:04:05.177
- Just slipped out.
- Hm.

1:04:05.219 --> 1:04:06.429
Okay, my turn?

1:04:06.469 --> 1:04:07.304
Mm-hm.

1:04:08.806 --> 1:04:10.766
I like that you have a good
relationship with your dad.

1:04:10.807 --> 1:04:12.101
That's boring.

1:04:12.143 --> 1:04:14.519
Okay, nice eyes.
Nice nose, nice-

1:04:14.561 --> 1:04:15.895
- It's too late.

1:04:17.231 --> 1:04:19.400
- Um...
- What's the third?

1:04:24.447 --> 1:04:26.824
I think you're a good liar.

1:04:31.036 --> 1:04:32.704
- What?
- Last night.

1:04:33.873 --> 1:04:38.168
What you said to Blake
at the end of Paranoia.

1:04:38.210 --> 1:04:39.503
I didn't lie.

1:04:44.215 --> 1:04:45.050
I didn't.

1:04:47.887 --> 1:04:52.350
You told him I asked if
you were tired of the game.

1:04:53.934 --> 1:04:55.269
Yeah, you did.

1:05:00.815 --> 1:05:05.737
I asked if you wanted to sit
on the porch with me instead.

1:05:06.614 --> 1:05:08.157
Well, it's the same thing.

1:05:15.164 --> 1:05:16.248
James.

1:05:16.289 --> 1:05:17.666
- Forget it.
- No, what?

1:05:17.708 --> 1:05:19.210
- No, it's my mistake.
- No, just tell me.

1:05:19.251 --> 1:05:22.672
I don't understand what's
happening. What are...

1:05:22.713 --> 1:05:25.257
- What?
- It's not the same thing.

1:05:28.302 --> 1:05:30.805
Not last night, not like that.

1:05:35.559 --> 1:05:37.144
I don't know what
you want me to say.

1:05:37.186 --> 1:05:39.646
You don't
have to say anything.

1:05:39.688 --> 1:05:41.190
I know I don't
have to say anything,

1:05:41.231 --> 1:05:44.402
but I don't know what
you want me to say.

1:05:49.239 --> 1:05:50.156
What? Just tell me.

1:05:50.199 --> 1:05:51.075
- No.
- What?

1:05:51.117 --> 1:05:52.034
Because we both know

1:05:52.076 --> 1:05:52.994
how the conversation's gonna go.

1:05:53.034 --> 1:05:53.743
- No, we don't!
- Yes, we do.

1:05:53.786 --> 1:05:55.246
No, we don't!

1:05:55.286 --> 1:05:56.538
Yes, I'd rather it
just stay like this, okay?

1:05:56.579 --> 1:05:58.915
- Like what?
- Suspended in the maybe.

1:06:05.380 --> 1:06:06.214
Shit.

1:06:20.896 --> 1:06:23.149
I like you too, you know?

1:06:25.483 --> 1:06:26.693
You don't have to say that.

1:06:26.735 --> 1:06:29.404
I know I don't
have to say that.

1:06:29.447 --> 1:06:33.451
Just like I didn't
have to let you stay.

1:06:37.621 --> 1:06:40.958
I don't get crushes
on people anymore.

1:06:44.711 --> 1:06:45.713
Me either.

1:06:51.302 --> 1:06:52.970
I kind of miss it.

1:06:57.807 --> 1:06:59.101
Yeah, me too.

1:07:01.646 --> 1:07:04.023
Is that him or your dad?

1:07:04.065 --> 1:07:05.650
It doesn't matter.

1:07:24.751 --> 1:07:26.878
This isn't normally
how it goes.

1:07:31.925 --> 1:07:34.804
We can forget about it.

1:07:34.844 --> 1:07:36.304
Tomorrow, if you want.

1:09:28.708 --> 1:09:29.793
Hi.

1:09:31.420 --> 1:09:33.463
This suddenly feels
very vulnerable.

1:09:33.506 --> 1:09:36.634
Honestly, it's the third time
I'm recording this intro,

1:09:36.676 --> 1:09:41.013
but I promised myself I'm
not gonna do it again, so...

1:09:41.055 --> 1:09:41.889
Yeah.

1:09:43.306 --> 1:09:45.976
We haven't found each other yet,

1:09:47.353 --> 1:09:49.939
but when we do, I just, um,

1:09:49.980 --> 1:09:52.565
I'm doing this because when
we do, I want you to know

1:09:52.608 --> 1:09:53.943
this part of me.

1:09:56.569 --> 1:09:59.155
The...

1:10:00.198 --> 1:10:01.282
Experience of

1:10:04.161 --> 1:10:06.788
wanting you before knowing you.

1:10:08.748 --> 1:10:13.670
I guess I don't wanna forget
either, which is weird, but...

1:10:15.297 --> 1:10:16.131
Yeah.

1:10:18.009 --> 1:10:21.554
Anyway, this is for
you. Whoever you are.

1:10:21.595 --> 1:10:23.639
Or who you will be.

1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:27.559
I don't know your name
or where you're from,

1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:30.854
or when or how we're
gonna meet, but...

1:10:33.189 --> 1:10:35.734
When you're not just a
hazy shadow in my mind,

1:10:35.775 --> 1:10:38.653
I hope cassette players
are still a thing.

1:10:41.990 --> 1:10:43.743
Haven't listen to
that in a while.

1:10:43.783 --> 1:10:47.496
Shit, um... I'm
sorry, I didn't mean to-

1:10:47.537 --> 1:10:52.500
- I knew there was a 50/50
shot of it happening, so...

1:10:54.295 --> 1:10:57.965
It's so lame, right?

1:10:58.006 --> 1:11:00.800
No. No, I don't
really think so.

1:11:02.886 --> 1:11:04.262
I really am sorry, I
didn't mean to pry.

1:11:04.305 --> 1:11:05.806
Stop apologizing.

1:11:17.568 --> 1:11:21.072
I thought you said
it was for that girl?

1:11:22.614 --> 1:11:23.615
What girl?

1:11:25.242 --> 1:11:26.786
The girl in the
car, you said that-

1:11:26.827 --> 1:11:30.081
- I've never had a
summer fling in Plymouth.

1:11:30.122 --> 1:11:31.082
Just, uh...

1:11:32.416 --> 1:11:35.043
Felt like an easier explanation
than making a mix tape

1:11:35.086 --> 1:11:38.213
for a figment of my imagination.

1:11:38.255 --> 1:11:41.717
Especially 'cause I'd only
known you like 45 minutes, so...

1:11:49.225 --> 1:11:51.435
James Madison and Jane Doe.

1:11:56.023 --> 1:11:58.150
Your parents named
you after a president?

1:11:58.192 --> 1:11:59.568
Mm-hm.

1:12:01.112 --> 1:12:05.949
Setting the stage for a lifetime
of debilitating nostalgia.

1:12:15.417 --> 1:12:16.251
You good?

1:12:22.507 --> 1:12:23.341
Yeah.

1:12:25.636 --> 1:12:26.846
Yeah, I'm good.

1:12:48.743 --> 1:12:51.037
Uh, the instructions
said to leave them

1:12:51.078 --> 1:12:53.998
in the rock, but considering.

1:12:54.039 --> 1:12:56.583
Five stars, right?

1:12:56.626 --> 1:12:58.293
You know, I was
gonna go with three!

1:12:59.628 --> 1:13:02.213
I guess we can
meet in the middle.

1:13:02.256 --> 1:13:03.048
Four.

1:13:04.759 --> 1:13:07.261
- Back to New York?
- Yeah.

1:13:07.302 --> 1:13:10.096
Pit stop in Hartford
to see my sister,

1:13:10.139 --> 1:13:12.475
but I'll be back by tonight.

1:13:14.685 --> 1:13:16.479
- Boston?
- Yeah.

1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:17.355
Cool.

1:13:18.855 --> 1:13:19.689
Cool.

1:13:21.024 --> 1:13:22.442
Cool, cool, cool.

1:13:30.283 --> 1:13:32.827
You know, I used to have
all the route patterns

1:13:32.869 --> 1:13:34.997
of my favorite trails memorized.

1:13:35.038 --> 1:13:38.458
I could run all four miles
of them with my eyes closed.

1:13:38.501 --> 1:13:39.335
But...

1:13:41.545 --> 1:13:43.047
Now, I don't know.

1:13:44.422 --> 1:13:46.675
If you asked me what the color
of the apartment building

1:13:46.716 --> 1:13:48.885
across from mine was, I...

1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:53.306
I don't think I could tell you.

1:14:06.737 --> 1:14:09.239
Do you have time
for breakfast?
