00:31.448 --> 00:33.313
Narrator:
Deep in the heart of Africa

00:33.450 --> 00:35.816
is a place no man has ever entered.

00:35.953 --> 00:39.571
A place that belongs to the lion,
the elephant and the ape.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.997
A place known as the bukuvu.

00:42.709 --> 00:46.497
Travelers flying overhead
can only glimpse at its many marvels:

00:46.588 --> 00:48.499
Its sparkling rivers,

00:48.590 --> 00:50.171
its lush veldts,

00:50.884 --> 00:52.875
its billowy cloud formations

00:53.345 --> 00:57.429
and its hidden mountains.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.620
- Never fear, my friends.
- George! George!

01:00.644 --> 01:02.509
All was not lost.

01:02.980 --> 01:06.313
Scraped and boo-booed,
they searched high and low,

01:06.984 --> 01:11.273
but they never recovered
their most precious cargo.

01:17.661 --> 01:19.822
George, George
George of the jungle

01:19.913 --> 01:22.074
strong as he can be

01:24.293 --> 01:26.534
watch out for that tree

01:26.628 --> 01:28.710
George, George
George of the jungle

01:28.797 --> 01:31.209
lives a life that's free

01:33.385 --> 01:35.467
watch out for that tree

01:35.554 --> 01:37.715
when he gets in a scrape
he makes his escape

01:37.806 --> 01:40.843
with help from his friend
an ape named ape

01:40.934 --> 01:43.220
and his elephant shep
can fetch a log

01:43.312 --> 01:46.725
he's man's best friend
he's George's dog

01:46.815 --> 01:49.101
he's George, George
George of the jungle

01:49.192 --> 01:51.183
strong as he can be

01:53.614 --> 01:55.696
watch out for that tree

01:55.782 --> 01:57.693
hear him holler swing and sing

01:57.784 --> 02:00.241
all the animals come
to the jungle king

02:00.329 --> 02:02.240
George, George
George of the jungle

02:02.331 --> 02:04.367
George, George
George of the jungle

02:04.458 --> 02:06.824
so grab a vine and swing in time

02:06.918 --> 02:09.660
if you smack a tree
just pay no mind

02:09.755 --> 02:12.462
like George, George
George of the jungle

02:12.549 --> 02:14.631
strong as he can be

02:17.012 --> 02:19.048
watch out for that tree

02:19.139 --> 02:21.676
watch out for that bang! Ooh!

02:21.808 --> 02:23.673
Tree

02:27.439 --> 02:29.521
George, George
George of the jungle

02:29.608 --> 02:31.519
watch out for that tree

02:32.778 --> 02:35.019
narrator: Twenty-five years later,
the bouncing baby boy

02:35.113 --> 02:37.900
has grown
into a swinging jungle king.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.823
He is swift. He is strong.

02:41.286 --> 02:45.495
He is sure. He is smart.

02:45.582 --> 02:46.822
He is unconscious.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.120
Meanwhile, 43 vines away,

02:50.253 --> 02:53.666
George's kingdom was being threatened
by a terrifying intruder.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.463
Hi, everybody. Me again.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.921
Third day in mbwebwe.
Look at this incredible...

02:59.096 --> 03:02.759
- Banyan tree.
- Banyan tree. And look what's in it.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.937
Could you die?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.102
And over here

03:13.318 --> 03:16.435
is the outhouse, which you
don't want to see, believe me.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.730
By the way, Betsy, thank you so
much for those moist towelettes.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.361
They've been a lifesaver.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.778
And these are the wonderful porters.
Wave, guys.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.238
And this is our guide, Mr. kwame.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.541
Without him, we would be lost. Hi.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.745
This is great.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.919
And this is... Lyle!

03:38.427 --> 03:40.383
Hello, bujumburans.

03:40.929 --> 03:41.964
What are you doing here?

03:42.055 --> 03:44.637
What kind of greeting is that
to give your fiancé?

03:45.350 --> 03:48.342
Aren't you happy to see me?
Yeah! Of course I am.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.645
The jungle loves you. You're beautiful.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.014
How did you find me?

03:54.151 --> 03:56.391
Well, I just hired the two
best trackers in the business.

03:56.903 --> 03:59.315
Aah! I'm chafing, Max.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.151
Ah, yeah, I'm chafing big time.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.700
Didn't I tell you not to wear 20 pounds
of black leather in the jungle?

04:06.288 --> 04:07.949
- Didn"t I tell ya?
- Ah.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.997
Cotton, I said. Cotton breathes.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.325
Take my things to the lady's tent
and shake a leg.

04:17.798 --> 04:19.755
Narrator: Later that night,
Lyle Van de groot

04:19.843 --> 04:21.673
lost no time in making arrangements

04:21.762 --> 04:24.378
to whisk his wayward fiancée
back home.

04:24.473 --> 04:28.716
I'll take it. Nairobi Hilton.
They can airlift us there in two hours.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.888
Pillows, okay?

04:31.146 --> 04:34.183
Wait a second. I'm losing you.
Bad reception here.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.890
Okay, I've got you back.
No, wait! I'm losing you!

04:37.068 --> 04:39.150
My batteries are dead! No! Doody!

04:39.696 --> 04:41.482
I don't want to go anyway, Lyle.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.189
Tomorrow we're gonna climb the mountain
where the big apes are.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.816
Don't you wanna see them?

04:46.286 --> 04:49.278
Only if they can shake a good
gin Martini without bruising it.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.200
How!

04:51.750 --> 04:53.706
Me and Thor here would be happy
to help you

04:53.794 --> 04:55.659
and the lady up the mountain,
Mr. Van de groot.

04:56.087 --> 04:59.204
- Yeah.
- Mr. kwame leading the way, of course.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.297
If you don't mind me saying so,

05:01.927 --> 05:04.464
the apes are supposed to be
a fascinating sight,

05:05.222 --> 05:06.428
especially that white ape.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.679
White ape? What's that?

05:09.434 --> 05:13.143
Ask Mr. kwame.
I bet he can tell you.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.686
Kwame: It is only a native legend.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.177
Ursula: Could you please tell us?

05:20.403 --> 05:22.815
The people say he is over seven feet tall,

05:22.906 --> 05:24.646
with the strength of a lion.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.945
When the moon is full
and the air is sweet,

05:28.119 --> 05:30.201
he wanders alone through the jungle,

05:30.288 --> 05:34.201
piercing the silence of the valley
with his mournful call.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.827
Now, some say he is thirsty
for blood.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.998
Others say he is calling
for the mate that he longs for,

05:43.134 --> 05:44.715
but will never find.

05:45.804 --> 05:50.047
By day, he rules the entire bukuvu
from the top of the mountain.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.015
But by night...

05:52.185 --> 05:55.848
He and bigfoot run the candy counter
at the bukuvu cineplex.

05:56.273 --> 05:59.982
Now playing on all 14 screens:
Planet of the apes.

06:03.822 --> 06:04.857
Bigfoot?

06:04.948 --> 06:06.939
Max, that'd be worth
a lot more than any white...

06:08.285 --> 06:10.025
Lyle: Ursula, what are we doing here?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.951
Lyle, I came all this way...

06:12.038 --> 06:15.201
Okay, okay.
The things I do for you.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.032
Looks like we're on, fellows.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.706
Narrator: As the sun Rose
over ape mountain,

06:20.839 --> 06:25.333
its agitated inhabitants sent
an urgent message to George by bongo-gram,

06:25.468 --> 06:28.426
warning the jungle king that
intruders were close afoot.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.700
Ooh. Lyle, listen. What was that?

06:30.724 --> 06:33.466
Could be the mating call
of the white ape.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.100
White ape. Sounds like a drink.

06:36.354 --> 06:39.312
Yes, bartender. I'll have
two black Russians and a white ape.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.766
Narrator: A drink the venal Van
de groot would be begging to imbibe

06:42.944 --> 06:46.562
if he only knew how near the white ape
was at that very moment,

06:46.865 --> 06:49.777
flying through the foliage,
surveying the scenery,

06:49.951 --> 06:54.945
cruising in for a closer look, swinging
through the trees with effortless ease.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.665
George: Ow!

06:58.418 --> 07:01.626
And so, onward and upward
the tired trekkers trudged

07:01.713 --> 07:04.546
on feverish footsies
over perilous paths.

07:04.716 --> 07:08.834
When they finally beheld the mighty
ape mountain, they reacted with awe.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.630
All: Aww.

07:10.931 --> 07:14.469
Narrator: I said "awe." A-w-e.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.266
- All: Ooh!
- Narrator: That's better.

07:17.354 --> 07:21.017
Kwame: Single file on the bridge.
Step very cautiously.

07:21.399 --> 07:25.233
It is full of rotten planks.
One false move, you could fall over.

07:25.820 --> 07:29.358
Then you will have
a very long time to wave good-bye.

07:29.741 --> 07:32.608
Don't you worry, peanut.
I was on a bridge like this in Maui.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.575
It was steady as a rock. See?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.695
Kwame: Stop! Stop that!

07:40.210 --> 07:42.292
I got you.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.961
No!

07:48.051 --> 07:50.793
Narrator: Don't worry.
Nobody dies in this story.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.921
They just get really big boo-boos.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.097
What did I tell you?

07:57.102 --> 08:00.094
They shouldn't let inexperienced guides
like that on these treks.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.601
Mm-hmm.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.793
Did you see the look
that guy just gave me?

08:10.865 --> 08:13.626
Probably saying I'm the biggest jerk
they've ever seen in their lives.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.070
Probably trying to think
of something evil to do to me.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.336
Aah!

08:24.838 --> 08:26.678
If they turn on us,
we're never gonna get home.

08:27.090 --> 08:30.924
It's up to me to make the peace.
I'm going in.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.923
Gentlemen. Cigar? Cigarette?

08:34.681 --> 08:36.842
Okay, gifts from America.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.078
- Lyle: I give you a cigar,
- Hey, hey.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.592
You give me some of your lands.

08:40.895 --> 08:44.433
All right. My first contact has been made.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.647
Ready, aim...

08:50.655 --> 08:52.771
Lyle: There you go, my man.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.358
You like magic fire? Do ya?

08:56.453 --> 08:59.240
Well, get a load of that.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.998
There you go. Magic picture.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.830
Yet another gift from America.
Here you go.

09:07.338 --> 09:08.418
You're welcome.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.461
Thirty-five millimeters.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.022
Translation, please.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.229
He says that he likes
your magic pictures,

09:30.403 --> 09:34.146
but he prefers the resolution
of the Leica 35-millimeter transparency.

09:34.741 --> 09:38.654
He also says your lens is dirty, but he
has the equipment to clean it for you.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.873
Well, tell him to clean this
while he's at it.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.284
Come on, let's go. “Where?

09:48.046 --> 09:50.662
To find you an ape, so we can get
the heck outta here.

09:51.174 --> 09:55.008
Lyle, we can't go into the jungle alone.
We could get lost out here.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.672
It's my job to get you what you want.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.129
You want a double decaf latte
with mocha sprinkles,

09:59.349 --> 10:01.806
you will get a double decaf latte
with mocha sprinkles.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.725
You want a white ape,
I'll get you a white ape.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.261
Here, monkey, monkey, monkey.

10:07.816 --> 10:10.603
Here, gorilla, gorilla. Come on.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.526
_shh.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.281
- Don't move.
- I actually found one? It worked?

10:30.088 --> 10:32.295
Hmm.

10:32.924 --> 10:35.836
- God, that scared me.
- Scared me, too.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.051
I'm gonna go get help. You wait here.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.779
Oh, no.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.019
Aaah!

11:46.289 --> 11:49.531
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.787
Ooh! Ooh!

12:06.684 --> 12:10.142
Eww! When lion brush last?

12:11.898 --> 12:15.766
Don't tickle. Don't tickle.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.976
I'll...

12:29.082 --> 12:32.495
Rubber tree always good for clothesline.
Upsy, kitty.

12:42.387 --> 12:45.299
George not even trying hard.

12:51.479 --> 12:53.435
Flying pile driver.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.638
Having some fun now.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.016
Bad kitty!

13:16.879 --> 13:21.293
- That close one, huh?
- Watch out for that tree!

13:22.218 --> 13:23.628
Huh?

13:27.140 --> 13:28.721
Oops.

13:29.225 --> 13:32.262
Hmm?

13:32.687 --> 13:34.769
Hmm. Funny-looking fella.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.320
The white ape.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.486
U-u-Ursula! Ursula!

13:57.837 --> 14:00.044
Ursula, I found your scrunchie.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.068
Lyle: Go away!

14:35.583 --> 14:36.914
It was horrible.

14:37.794 --> 14:41.378
An almost 400-pound white ape man.

14:41.631 --> 14:45.920
The white ape has my girlfriend.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.961
I held him off as long as I could.
Blood everywhere.

14:50.598 --> 14:53.260
The white ape got my girlfriend.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.468
He weighs 400 pounds.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.811
The white ape got my girlfriend!

14:59.148 --> 15:01.355
The white ape got... help! Help!

15:01.859 --> 15:03.599
Man needs help!

15:16.833 --> 15:19.449
Narrator: After a night
of feverish fantasies,

15:19.544 --> 15:22.832
the perfectly permed heiress,
Ursula stanhope,

15:23.172 --> 15:26.664
awoke to the melodious music
of the bukuvu bird life

15:27.051 --> 15:31.385
and found herself venturing forth in
search of that defender of the innocent,

15:31.597 --> 15:33.133
protector of the weak

15:33.224 --> 15:37.183
and all-around good guy,
George of the jungle.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.472
But that's not who she saw first.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.849
“What!

15:49.115 --> 15:51.697
Get away! Get away! Get away!

15:56.038 --> 15:57.778
Hmm?

16:04.088 --> 16:06.420
Hello.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.460
Oh, dear.

16:11.846 --> 16:12.926
Feeling better, fella?

16:14.932 --> 16:17.048
Okay. It's that dream, then.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.726
I'm still having that
psycho dream. Hello.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.348
Oh, no, no! Don't worry! Ape friend.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.921
Ape make your breakfast.
“What does it want? What does it want?

16:27.945 --> 16:32.154
"It" wants its physician's
desk reference, if you don't mind.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.783
Unless you'd rather die
of dengue fever, of course.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.157
- That is very funny!
- Ha, ha, ha.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.079
I thought I heard the monkey talk.

16:41.751 --> 16:45.710
But that is totally
understandable, right?

16:45.880 --> 16:48.667
I mean, why wouldn't
an ape read textbooks?

16:48.966 --> 16:51.252
And why wouldn't I find
myself in a tree house

16:51.344 --> 16:55.428
with room service and a Tarzan wannabe,
wearing a, um

16:55.848 --> 16:57.839
what do you call that thing?

16:58.392 --> 17:00.178
- Butt flap.
- Right.

17:01.646 --> 17:04.387
Oh...

17:04.690 --> 17:05.690
Ay!

17:07.193 --> 17:09.229
Ooh! Mmm.

17:10.820 --> 17:15.281
- Ape: Bit of a shock, I suppose. Yes.
- Fever.

17:16.452 --> 17:21.162
Cold compress. Dab her lightly, George.
"Talking monkey."

17:23.000 --> 17:25.161
That's the ticket. Good.

17:25.336 --> 17:26.541
Huh?

17:27.630 --> 17:29.621
Huh? Something funny about this fella.

17:30.383 --> 17:34.797
She's not a "fella," George. She's
a woman, the female of your species.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.800
You mean ape and George not brothers?

17:39.100 --> 17:41.216
Well, in a sense, we are related.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.843
After all, we're both members
of the primate family.

17:44.105 --> 17:45.766
Primate family. Brothers.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.806
I suppose one might claim...

17:48.943 --> 17:52.606
Mommy, make that monkey
stop talking.

17:53.364 --> 17:57.323
Perhaps I should refrain from speaking
around her, as it seems to upset her.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.593
- What your name?
- Ursula.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.802
Ursula stanhope.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.055
- Who are you?
- George.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.098
George primate.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.982
And that brother ape.
Ape primate.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.854
Ah! Oh, um...

18:35.948 --> 18:39.065
Okay, I'm gonna pass out again now.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.070
Bye.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.612
Aah!

18:45.458 --> 18:48.541
It's a sissy white ape.
I would've choked the life out of him,

18:48.711 --> 18:51.919
except that he had two
of his lion buddies jump me from behind.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.672
So in this version,
there are two lions with the white ape?

18:54.800 --> 18:57.542
A minute ago, there was only one.

18:57.637 --> 19:01.630
Hey, the important thing,
kwame, is that I was outnumbered.

19:04.602 --> 19:05.762
Absolutely.

19:30.086 --> 19:31.542
Hi.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.954
When I woke up this morning,
I remembered about that lion,

19:35.049 --> 19:37.961
and I know you saved me yesterday.

19:38.552 --> 19:41.214
- And I just wanted to say thank you.
- Ah!

19:42.139 --> 19:43.174
Ooh!

19:44.308 --> 19:48.221
Now I'm feeling better, I realize the
others must think I'm cat food by now.

19:48.354 --> 19:51.892
And I don't want my fian...
This guy that I was with, to worry.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.435
So I should probably go
and look for them.

19:55.486 --> 19:59.229
- I was wondering if you could help me.
- Ursula want to go already?

20:04.370 --> 20:06.156
Okay, George help. Get trusty doggy.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.245
Oh, you have a dog. That's great.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.538
Doggy will help find friends.
George call shep.

20:10.835 --> 20:13.167
Shep! Here boy!

20:13.546 --> 20:15.537
Come on! Here, boy.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.792
Shep!

20:18.467 --> 20:21.834
Here comes shep.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.261
Come on, shep! Come on, boy!

20:25.141 --> 20:26.551
That a boy! Want to play?

20:26.684 --> 20:29.721
Come on! Come on! Come on!

20:31.313 --> 20:32.974
Good boy.

20:33.649 --> 20:37.187
Come on, boy! Come on!
Good boy, shep!

20:37.737 --> 20:40.319
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop, stop, stop!

20:40.531 --> 20:41.896
Sit. Sit.

20:42.158 --> 20:46.652
Good boy! Good obedience training.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.282
- George trained from pup.
- That's your dog?

20:49.665 --> 20:52.702
This shep, George's big,
gray, peanut-loving poochie.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.417
Good boy, shep! Good boy.

20:56.297 --> 20:58.754
Good boy, shep! Good boy.

20:59.049 --> 21:02.086
That's a good boy. Want to shake?

21:02.178 --> 21:04.260
Mmm?

21:04.346 --> 21:08.259
- Good... doggy. Be nice.
- Shep.

21:08.350 --> 21:12.684
Ursula: Shake? George. George.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.764
George!

21:21.864 --> 21:24.526
- See? Shep shake.
- Oh, George.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.700
He's a big poochie, all right.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.903
Does he fetch?

21:31.999 --> 21:34.661
Here, boy. Come on, boy.

21:34.752 --> 21:37.789
Want a stick? Where's the stick?

21:37.880 --> 21:43.000
Where's the stick, shep?

21:43.093 --> 21:45.129
Here it is. Here, boy. Fetch!

21:47.056 --> 21:49.798
Come on, boy! Run, run! Run, boy!

21:49.892 --> 21:53.726
Good boy. Go on, boy! Go get it!

21:59.944 --> 22:02.560
- Where'd he go?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.860
Ursula: Wow!

22:06.951 --> 22:09.693
Ape: No, not in the roses! Aah!

22:11.914 --> 22:13.745
George: Ungawa, shep!

22:13.833 --> 22:16.825
Narrator: And so, with the help
of the jungle king's big, gray,

22:16.919 --> 22:19.626
peanut-loving poochie,
George and Ursula set out

22:19.713 --> 22:24.002
on a desperate search to find
her fianc... uh, that guy she was with...

22:24.093 --> 22:26.835
Lyle! Lyle!

22:26.929 --> 22:31.844
- Ursula! Ursula!
- While he desperately searched for her.

22:31.934 --> 22:36.052
Narrator: But by the end of the
afternoon her desperation had dimmed,

22:36.146 --> 22:38.102
that was fantastic!

22:38.190 --> 22:40.897
And she had given up
all hope of everything

22:40.985 --> 22:44.352
except enjoying the jungle king's
company from her precarious perch

22:44.446 --> 22:45.902
atop his faithful doggy.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.050
So, where are we going now?

22:47.074 --> 22:48.985
To find tookie-tookie bird
for jungle news.

22:49.076 --> 22:52.159
Tookie-tookie bird. I love that.

22:52.454 --> 22:56.197
Narrator: Later they rested, while
the tired tusker teethed on a

22:56.292 --> 22:59.580
wait a second.
The dog bone is too much. Lose it.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.786
That's better.

23:04.008 --> 23:07.375
Bongo-gram. What could it mean?

23:07.469 --> 23:09.380
Aaah-aaah! Eee-eee! Tookie-tookie!

23:12.641 --> 23:16.884
Tookie say little monkey in trouble.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.012
George investigate.

23:35.664 --> 23:36.664
What happened?

23:39.543 --> 23:41.329
Where other monkeys?

23:42.087 --> 23:43.577
Where? There?

23:44.256 --> 23:46.338
How many? That many?

23:47.009 --> 23:50.217
Lots of monkey. Then what happened?

23:52.848 --> 23:54.338
Tell George more.

23:54.934 --> 23:55.934
No!

23:57.561 --> 24:00.849
Little monkey say other monkeys
call little monkey "runt."

24:01.440 --> 24:03.351
Not let little monkey play games.

24:03.734 --> 24:06.692
Poor thing. Hi, monkey.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.277
Hi. You okay?

24:12.368 --> 24:13.653
Monkey: No.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.369
Don't cry.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.954
Hmm.

24:23.045 --> 24:24.751
Little monkey like Ursula.

24:31.553 --> 24:34.295
What did you tell him?

24:34.390 --> 24:36.301
Just watch.

24:40.562 --> 24:44.305
(Chittering continues

24:44.400 --> 24:46.391
oh.

24:48.445 --> 24:51.152
Ah.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.488
Uh-oh!

25:42.207 --> 25:46.041
Narrator: Meanwhile, back at a really
big footprint in the mud...

25:49.339 --> 25:51.500
Let me through. What's happening?

25:51.592 --> 25:53.628
This footprint does not
belong to any of my men.

25:54.428 --> 25:56.043
Max: See? There's your proof.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.379
The white ape does exist.

25:58.474 --> 26:01.637
Now all we have to do is track down
the girl and the ape's in the bag.

26:02.144 --> 26:05.307
No, seriously. I don't know
if I want to do this again.

26:05.481 --> 26:09.269
Ursula need to relax when it come
to vine swinging, for George.

26:10.569 --> 26:14.562
Hmm? Swing, swing, swing.
Come on.

26:14.656 --> 26:17.135
Want George of jungle to tell you
special vine swinging secret?

26:17.159 --> 26:20.276
Fine. Tell me all your secrets.

26:20.370 --> 26:24.113
George's secrets. Hmph.
There's the shortest book ever written.

26:24.500 --> 26:29.039
Wrap it around your sock
for special George of jungle foot lock.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.586
- Now, ready to try again?
- No.

26:44.353 --> 26:48.016
George: Like this, Ursula!

26:48.107 --> 26:51.645
He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease

26:51.735 --> 26:55.694
our daring young man
on the flying trapeze

26:55.781 --> 26:58.443
- look, no hands!
- His movements so graceful

26:58.534 --> 27:00.365
all girls he could please

27:00.494 --> 27:04.954
and with love he is swinging away

27:05.040 --> 27:07.281
- he flies through the air with the
- That's pretty good.

27:07.376 --> 27:08.707
Greatest of ease

27:08.794 --> 27:11.501
George, watch out for that...

27:11.588 --> 27:13.544
Tree.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.797
Aaaah!

27:27.396 --> 27:30.729
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the king of the jungle.

27:40.242 --> 27:42.528
Where the devil is my egg timer?

27:42.619 --> 27:44.860
- Aaah-aah! Eee-eee! Tookie-tookie.
- Tookie!

27:44.955 --> 27:49.164
I'm fed up with this felonious fowl
stealing everything in the kitchen.

27:49.251 --> 27:53.369
- Miserable creature.
- Tookie-tookie.

27:53.463 --> 27:56.671
George, what on earth are you doing?

27:56.758 --> 28:00.091
George just feel like looking
a little special today, that all.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.763
Possibly there is a stirring
of special feelings within you?

28:05.559 --> 28:07.095
Mm-hmm.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.597
Uh-huh.

28:18.655 --> 28:21.897
George having stirring
of special feelings right now.

28:22.159 --> 28:23.899
Ape: I see.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.577
Good thing she same species, huh?
Yes.

28:28.290 --> 28:29.290
Ape?

28:31.585 --> 28:34.042
Tell George how to make Ursula
George's mate.

28:34.171 --> 28:38.710
- Mmm?
- Please? Brother?

28:38.800 --> 28:43.885
First, command her attention by bulging
out your cheeks and pursing your lips.

28:43.972 --> 28:47.885
- Show George.
- All right. Just like this. Watch.

28:52.856 --> 28:56.064
Even puffier.

28:56.151 --> 28:59.484
Next, display your interest
by drawing back your upper lip,

28:59.571 --> 29:03.314
jutting your jaw forward
and exposing your teeth.

29:03.408 --> 29:07.742
- Like this?
- Throw a handful of leaves in the air,

29:07.829 --> 29:10.571
then leap about and hoot
in a dominant fashion.

29:15.587 --> 29:16.587
Like this, ape?

29:16.838 --> 29:19.625
Good. She won't be able to resist that.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.047
Ursula!

29:25.973 --> 29:28.680
Gosh, this trails really rough.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.187
"Ursula! Ursula!"

29:42.447 --> 29:45.814
- Hey, come back here.
- They're not abandoning us, are they?

29:45.909 --> 29:48.321
- They are threatening.
- Lyle: If you don't mind, kwame,

29:48.412 --> 29:52.280
I have a knack for getting
the most out of my employees.

29:52.374 --> 29:54.615
Do you mind if I address the porters?

29:54.710 --> 29:56.792
They only speak Swahili.

29:56.878 --> 30:00.496
Well, I just happen to have
a Swahili phrase book.

30:00.590 --> 30:02.376
Be my guest.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.193
I think our troubles are over.

30:27.284 --> 30:30.868
Tell them I'll pay 50 zamoles a man if
they'll help me capture the white ape

30:30.954 --> 30:32.865
and bring him back alive. Alive?

30:32.956 --> 30:35.038
After he, uh...

30:36.043 --> 30:39.251
Well, he pulled Ursula's scrunchie off,
we know that much.

30:39.338 --> 30:43.001
- 50 zamoles a man. What do you say?
- They only speak Swahili.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.833
One hundred zamoles a man
and you got a deal.

30:45.927 --> 30:49.010
- Hey, wait a second.
- Done.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.549
Narrator: Meanwhile, at a very big
and expensive waterfall set,

30:53.685 --> 30:57.018
Ursula was amazed that she was lost
in the wilderness with a jungle man.

30:57.105 --> 31:00.893
Here I am, lost in the wilderness
with a jungle man.

31:05.822 --> 31:10.407
I should be terrified that
no one will ever find me, but I'm not.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.702
- Thank you.
- For what?

31:15.332 --> 31:16.788
For this adventure.

31:17.918 --> 31:19.533
It's what I've always wanted.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.252
King of jungle only here to help.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.511
Mr. bombastic

31:33.392 --> 31:37.010
the awesome, bombastic
romantic, fantastic lover

31:40.399 --> 31:43.641
Mr. lover-lover

31:43.735 --> 31:46.067
George, are you okay?

31:46.154 --> 31:49.146
Your face is swelling up like...

31:49.241 --> 31:51.948
Is something in my teeth?

32:00.752 --> 32:02.117
Okay.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.466
Listen, um,

32:10.637 --> 32:15.131
I'm gonna step outside
for a little air, okay?

32:18.645 --> 32:21.853
- Are you sure you threw the leaves?
- Yeah, George threw leaves.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.932
Well, cheer up, old boy.

32:25.193 --> 32:28.856
I spent all day poring through
every book in the library,

32:28.989 --> 32:31.446
and finally I found this.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.318
Hmm.

32:33.410 --> 32:36.652
It's positively packed full
of human courtship rituals.

32:36.746 --> 32:38.282
Ape: Listen.

32:50.927 --> 32:52.042
Go for it.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.305
= sa

33:06.234 --> 33:08.395
what... oh.

33:13.575 --> 33:15.361
Did you fight
a crocodile for this?

33:15.452 --> 33:17.738
Oh. No, George not fight.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.990
Crocodile have toothache.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.242
George pull tooth.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.704
Crocodile give to George after.
Gift.

33:25.795 --> 33:27.205
Good juju.

33:28.131 --> 33:31.248
- Juju?
- Good luck. Protection.

33:33.762 --> 33:36.219
I have something like that too.

33:36.306 --> 33:38.513
- Want to see?
- Mm-hmm.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.724
It's not worth anything.

33:41.937 --> 33:45.600
I found it in a cereal box
when I was ten years old.

33:46.191 --> 33:49.683
It's my good luck. My juju.

33:52.948 --> 33:53.948
Can I...

33:55.075 --> 33:56.075
Oh.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.870
I want you to have that.

34:10.966 --> 34:12.672
For George?

34:14.177 --> 34:17.418
That's the nicest present
George ever get.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.058
Thank you.

34:31.527 --> 34:34.018
All right, man. Yeah.

34:34.155 --> 34:35.895
It dancin' time.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.324
Ursula, wanna dance?

34:41.413 --> 34:43.949
Oh, no. Thanks.

34:44.040 --> 34:47.157
I'd be too embarrassed.
“What mean "embarrassed"?

34:47.627 --> 34:51.415
That's when you feel stupid
in front of other people.

34:52.132 --> 34:54.088
You know, like they're judging you.

34:55.092 --> 34:57.004
- You've never felt that?
- No.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.632
There are no other people.

34:59.723 --> 35:02.089
- Good point.
- George not feel stupid.

35:02.183 --> 35:05.095
Sometimes George smash
into tree, and sometime...

35:09.941 --> 35:12.728
Sometimes George
fall out of tree house,

35:13.111 --> 35:14.351
but not feel stupid.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.315
Something good always happen after.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.026
George just lucky, I guess.

35:19.659 --> 35:24.699
One day I looked up
and there you were

35:24.789 --> 35:29.032
no people here to look
stupid for. Just George.

35:29.127 --> 35:33.211
Like a simple question
looking for an answer

35:34.257 --> 35:39.092
now I am a whale
listening to some inner call

35:39.179 --> 35:43.422
swimming blindly to throw
myself upon your shore

35:43.516 --> 35:47.850
what if I don't find you
and I have landed

35:48.188 --> 35:52.477
would you leave me here to die
on your shore, stranded

35:52.734 --> 35:55.601
I think I know why
the dog howls at the moon

35:57.280 --> 36:00.693
I think I know why
the dog howls at the moon

36:01.493 --> 36:06.078
I sing dela, dela

36:06.164 --> 36:11.329
ngyanya dela when I'm with you

36:11.419 --> 36:15.788
dela, sondela, mama

36:15.882 --> 36:18.168
sondela

36:18.259 --> 36:20.796
I burn for you

36:20.887 --> 36:23.594
I've been waiting for you
all my life

36:23.682 --> 36:25.468
hoping for a miracle

36:25.558 --> 36:29.426
I've been waiting
day and night, day and night

36:30.605 --> 36:32.846
I've been waiting for you
all my life

36:33.108 --> 36:34.939
waiting for redemption

36:35.068 --> 36:37.354
I've been waiting day and night

36:37.445 --> 36:39.106
I burn for you

36:52.794 --> 36:56.378
Narrator: And so it came to pass
that George of the jungle

36:56.464 --> 36:59.501
attended his first co-ed dance.

37:06.266 --> 37:10.259
But his rapturous rendezvous with
the urban heiress was to be short-lived,

37:10.353 --> 37:15.473
as the very next morning, kwame and
his men were drawing dangerously close.

37:15.567 --> 37:19.731
That is, dangerously close
to shoving a coconut up Lyle's...

37:20.405 --> 37:21.736
Sleeping bag.

37:21.823 --> 37:24.235
That's it! I've had it!

37:24.325 --> 37:27.988
I am the richest, smartest, handsomest
guy here, so I get to go first.

37:34.335 --> 37:36.246
There's an elephant around here.

37:36.337 --> 37:40.330
Bad guy falls in poop.
Classical element of physical comedy.

37:40.425 --> 37:44.088
Now comes the part where we throw
our heads back and laugh. Ready?

37:44.179 --> 37:46.591
All: Ready!

37:49.100 --> 37:53.343
Those were nowhere near
properly digested.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.346
In case anybody's wondering, I'm okay.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.183
Have you cleaned my lighter yet?

38:09.037 --> 38:11.369
Lyle: Come on, come on.

38:13.208 --> 38:16.371
That was Ursula.

38:16.920 --> 38:21.084
Did you hear that? She's alive. Ursula!

38:21.174 --> 38:24.337
Why don't you bring on a brass band
while you're at it, you nit?

38:24.427 --> 38:26.588
We gotta be stealthy here, right?

38:27.555 --> 38:29.796
Stealthy. Right.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.306
Phew!

38:33.645 --> 38:34.645
Party time.

38:48.868 --> 38:51.280
Get off!

38:56.251 --> 38:57.787
It's him!

38:59.504 --> 39:01.244
Thor: Hey, it's a dude.

39:02.131 --> 39:04.122
I told you there weren't no white ape.

39:04.217 --> 39:07.584
You dragged me all the way here to look
at some guy in a leopard skin bikini.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.573
If I wanted to see that,
I could've stayed in Miami.

39:09.597 --> 39:11.178
Lyle: Wait a second.

39:11.266 --> 39:14.929
The white ape is a man? Let me at him.

39:15.728 --> 39:18.515
Hang on. Could you, uh, see
if he's dangerous?

39:18.606 --> 39:21.439
Here, boy!
Where's my little doggy?

39:22.485 --> 39:24.350
I've got a feeling he's not.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.106
Okay. I'll go first.

39:26.614 --> 39:29.356
If he gets aggressive,
I'll scare him off with this.

39:29.450 --> 39:30.610
I thought that was a lighter.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.322
It is a lighter,
but he doesn't know that.

39:39.669 --> 39:41.705
Lyle: Ursula, it's me.

39:41.963 --> 39:45.330
Lyle. Your man. I've come for you.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.124
Are you okay?

39:50.805 --> 39:52.921
Ursulal -

39:53.349 --> 39:55.806
- Lyle, what are you doing here?
- Thank god.

39:56.019 --> 39:59.762
Mushy bear, you're safe.
I don't believe it!

40:00.064 --> 40:04.478
Oh, I was so afraid for your safety.

40:06.529 --> 40:07.735
Lyle!

40:08.323 --> 40:11.110
Don't get all smoochy and disgusting
with me, okay?

40:11.200 --> 40:13.532
I remember what you did
when that lion came.

40:13.661 --> 40:17.654
What are you talking about?
I was fighting the lion the whole time.

40:18.333 --> 40:21.575
You were just so terrified
you don't remember.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.955
I remember George,
that's who I remember.

40:24.130 --> 40:25.165
George?

40:25.924 --> 40:28.085
Look over there. What do you see?

40:30.011 --> 40:32.844
- An elephant.
- But what has the elephant got?

40:36.809 --> 40:39.972
- Fleas. Ohl
- Ivory! White gold.

40:40.438 --> 40:44.727
Listen, Ursula, I have no idea what
you're talking about. Can we just go?

40:44.859 --> 40:47.475
- George!
- Ursula!

40:47.570 --> 40:48.980
Ready,

40:49.614 --> 40:51.855
aim...

40:56.537 --> 40:59.279
Run, shep! Run for your life!

40:59.374 --> 41:01.456
Did that monkey just speak?

41:01.542 --> 41:03.533
That monkey just spoke.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.710
- I knew it.
- He talked.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.788
- Shoot it now.
- Huh?

41:07.882 --> 41:11.966
With the tranquilizer gun, idiot!
That ape's worth a fortune.

41:12.053 --> 41:13.964
No!

41:14.055 --> 41:16.717
Stop, or I'll shoot!

41:25.108 --> 41:27.019
Ee - = sa Teenie

41:27.110 --> 41:31.570
George!

41:32.407 --> 41:33.522
Narrator: Whew!

41:33.616 --> 41:36.779
Okay, kids, let's settle down
and review the important information.

41:36.911 --> 41:37.911
Lyle is a big doofus.

41:37.996 --> 41:41.864
Poor George was really shot but can't die
because, let's face it, he's the hero.

41:41.958 --> 41:45.496
So, the concerned and preternaturally
wealthy Ursula stanhope

41:45.586 --> 41:48.874
whisked George off on a private jet
bound for the country of his birth

41:48.965 --> 41:52.002
where he would get the finest
medical treatment available.

41:52.093 --> 41:55.551
I'm gonna get you the finest
medical treatment available.

41:56.180 --> 42:00.423
As for those pesky, pernicious
and putrid poachers, Max and Thor,

42:00.601 --> 42:03.343
they awaited their fate
in the Bujumbura jail.

42:03.438 --> 42:06.054
Officer: You two, out.

42:06.149 --> 42:09.812
- Acquitted?
- No, deported.

42:09.944 --> 42:13.186
Narrator: Meanwhile, kwame and his
men faced the next-to-impossible task

42:13.281 --> 42:17.820
of picking out George's assailant
from a lineup of the usual suspects.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.781
Man: Too short. Too sweaty.

42:20.872 --> 42:24.581
Wait a second! That's the guy.
That's the guy who shot him.

42:24.667 --> 42:27.534
- I never forget a face.
- Me?

42:34.302 --> 42:38.341
No, Max. Forget about it. I do not want
to listen to any more of your ideas.

42:38.431 --> 42:42.219
You'll like this one. We're gonna steal
Georgie-boy's talking ape.

42:42.810 --> 42:44.141
You mean, back up the mountain?

42:44.228 --> 42:48.096
Thor, that ape is our ticket
out of poaching and into show business.

42:48.316 --> 42:50.773
- No.
- Think about it. We got a talking ape.

42:51.194 --> 42:53.401
What do siegfried and Roy have?

42:53.488 --> 42:55.103
- Sequins?
- Exactly.

42:55.990 --> 42:58.697
Get ready for room service,
mate, and girls.

42:58.993 --> 43:01.450
We're gettin' our ape
and going to Vegas.

43:01.537 --> 43:04.244
By next weekend,
we'll be headlining at the tropicana.

43:04.540 --> 43:06.952
- Nobody is gonna stop us.
- Right.

43:07.460 --> 43:10.247
George of the jungle
must be halfway to frisco by now.

43:10.671 --> 43:14.004
Narrator: Ah, but the plotting
poachers were only half correct,

43:14.092 --> 43:18.631
for at that very moment, our handsome
hero was all the way to San Francisco.

43:18.721 --> 43:19.836
Yes, mother, I'm safe.

43:19.931 --> 43:22.013
You're sure you didn't catch
dengue fever?

43:22.100 --> 43:24.136
No, mother, I did not catch dengue fever.

43:24.227 --> 43:26.593
- Well, how's your temperature?
- Normal.

43:26.687 --> 43:29.929
- Color of your tongue?
- Pink.

43:30.024 --> 43:32.106
- What about your hmm-hmm?
- Regular.

43:32.193 --> 43:35.310
Now, Lyle. How is my darling
future son-in-law?

43:35.404 --> 43:39.898
Lyle is...

43:40.118 --> 43:43.155
He's happy to be home, mom.
Could you hold on one second?

43:46.666 --> 43:50.534
George, please don't call any animals
into the car, okay?

43:50.753 --> 43:51.753
Thanks.

43:51.838 --> 43:54.295
Mom?

43:54.382 --> 43:58.546
Mom, hold on. I'm losing you again.
George. George.

43:58.636 --> 44:01.218
Are you paying any attention?
This is important.

44:01.305 --> 44:03.967
I know it's important.

44:04.058 --> 44:06.640
No, George. Hot, hot, hot.

44:06.727 --> 44:10.686
This faster than riding
big, great, peanut-loving poochie shep.

44:10.773 --> 44:13.230
Love you, mom. Gotta go. Bye.
Watch out for that...

44:13.317 --> 44:16.309
Ooh!

44:24.829 --> 44:26.990
Ursula:
So, what do you think of my jungle?

44:27.081 --> 44:28.491
This very high tree house.

44:29.709 --> 44:32.075
Good place to call friends from.
Sound carry.

44:32.503 --> 44:36.246
Oh, no, no, no, no.

44:36.340 --> 44:38.752
The neighbors.

44:38.843 --> 44:41.835
Man: Shut up, buddy! Give it a rest.

44:41.929 --> 44:46.923
We're 10 stories up, George. I don't
think the animals can make it up here.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.851
Oh, sure. George know that.

44:51.105 --> 44:52.185
George know that.

45:02.783 --> 45:04.148
You must be tired.

45:04.243 --> 45:08.987
I'll make the couch up
for you to sleep in the living room.

45:09.123 --> 45:11.956
Oh, no. George sleep here
in tree house.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.951
Okay. Good night.

45:17.882 --> 45:18.997
Sleep sweet, Ursula.

45:20.635 --> 45:21.966
Sleep sweet, George.

45:26.182 --> 45:27.182
Ooh.

45:29.810 --> 45:32.051
Narrator:
Well, Ursula's fiancé is in prison,

45:32.146 --> 45:34.228
and there's a jungle man
sleeping on her balcony.

45:34.315 --> 45:36.727
- She could use a best friend right now.
- Hi.

45:36.817 --> 45:38.728
- Hi.
- I got here as fast as I could.

45:38.819 --> 45:39.819
Where is he?

45:39.904 --> 45:41.465
He's under the waterf...
He's in the shower.

45:41.489 --> 45:43.400
Not anymore.

45:43.491 --> 45:45.982
- George.
- Oh. Bad waterfall.

45:46.077 --> 45:49.820
First water get hot, then George
slip on this strange, yellow rock.

45:49.914 --> 45:51.745
Oh!

45:51.832 --> 45:54.414
Hi. George of jungle.

45:55.127 --> 45:56.788
- Charmed, I'm sure.
- George.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.791
Um, take this big book,

46:00.841 --> 46:04.004
cover the Booty, get into decent clothes.

46:04.095 --> 46:05.756
- Sorry, Betsy. Bye.
- No problem.

46:05.846 --> 46:08.758
I see why they made him
king of the jungle.

46:09.809 --> 46:12.016
Betsy, I am in trouble here, okay?

46:12.270 --> 46:15.012
How am I gonna tell my parents
that my fiancé's in an African jail

46:15.106 --> 46:17.017
and that I brought home a jungle man?

46:17.566 --> 46:19.727
You are totally stuck on George, huh?

46:20.069 --> 46:21.934
No, I am not!

46:22.863 --> 46:23.863
Can I have him then?

46:24.782 --> 46:27.068
Okay, let's think. Think, think, think.

46:27.159 --> 46:30.572
Think, think, think.
What am I gonna do about tomorrow?

46:30.788 --> 46:32.244
Tomorrow is your engagement party,

46:32.331 --> 46:34.993
and unless they give day passes
out of Bujumbura jail

46:35.084 --> 46:36.699
Lyle is not likely to attend.

46:36.794 --> 46:40.286
So tell 'em the truth,
don't worry about it and take George.

46:40.673 --> 46:43.289
- He can back up your story. Right?
- All right.

46:43.926 --> 46:45.837
I'll tell my dad
first thing in the morning.

46:46.178 --> 46:49.921
Make it second thing. First thing, I
suggest you buy jungle man some clothes.

46:54.312 --> 46:55.768
Nice butt flap.

47:02.611 --> 47:05.648
Narrator: Being of a conservative
mind regarding gender roles,

47:05.740 --> 47:07.776
Ursula stanhope wasted no time

47:07.867 --> 47:11.451
in taking George of the jungle
to a fine haberdasher.

47:14.290 --> 47:15.610
Ursula:
And this is neiman Marcus.

47:15.958 --> 47:19.450
Whoo! They have big, shiny cave.

47:20.046 --> 47:22.082
Would you like to sample
our new fragrance?

47:22.173 --> 47:24.755
Thank you.

47:32.058 --> 47:33.923
Narrator:
Later, in the men's department,

47:34.018 --> 47:36.009
after discovering
his long-lost brothers,

47:36.103 --> 47:40.722
the jungle king was pleased to find
he looked pretty good in Armani.

47:40.816 --> 47:42.477
Pretty darn good.

47:43.611 --> 47:45.442
What's up, my man?

47:45.946 --> 47:47.857
- Watch out, man!
- Oh-oh-oh!

47:48.324 --> 47:51.282
Why everyone run around crazy,
like antelope in mating season?

47:51.744 --> 47:53.221
They're just trying to make a living.

47:53.245 --> 47:55.236
It's a different kind
of jungle here, George.

47:55.331 --> 47:57.822
Survival of the fittest. Dog eat dog.

47:57.917 --> 48:01.080
- "Dog eat dog"... dog eat dog here?
- No, that's not what I meant.

48:01.295 --> 48:03.536
George never bring shep here.
Uh-uh. Never.

48:03.631 --> 48:05.792
Every story gets to have
a really big coincidence,

48:05.883 --> 48:07.043
ahd here's ours:

48:07.134 --> 48:10.752
Who should see them walking down the
street but Ursula's meddling mother?

48:11.013 --> 48:12.924
Yes, Lyle Van de groot, please.

48:13.015 --> 48:16.007
- I'm sorry. He's not back from Africa.
- He's not?

48:16.102 --> 48:18.184
Woman: No. I'm sorry.

48:18.270 --> 48:20.682
Narrator: Meanwhile, back on
ape mountain,

48:20.773 --> 48:25.016
George's friends were going positively
gaga from missing the jungle king.

48:25.111 --> 48:26.851
No!

48:26.946 --> 48:30.188
Oh, look at this. Ruined. Ruined!

48:30.282 --> 48:32.022
Shep, come here at once.

48:32.118 --> 48:34.325
Come on!

48:35.037 --> 48:37.528
How many times do I have to tell you?

48:37.623 --> 48:41.036
- My violin bow is not a chew toy!
- Blaa-aa-aaah!

48:41.127 --> 48:42.788
Bad dog!

48:42.878 --> 48:46.245
And you! Out of my sight,
you feathered fool.

48:47.466 --> 48:48.876
No!

48:48.968 --> 48:52.460
Not on the tree house! I'll smack you...

48:52.930 --> 48:54.636
On!

48:55.433 --> 48:56.889
Ursula, it's mother.

48:57.017 --> 49:00.885
Pick up the phone and tell me who that man
was I saw you strolling with today.

49:00.980 --> 49:04.143
And where is Lyle?
We must discuss the engagement party.

49:05.025 --> 49:06.640
I know you're there, Ursula.

49:06.735 --> 49:09.693
Pick up the phone and tell me
why you have been avoiding me.

49:10.239 --> 49:11.820
Pick up the phone!

49:15.327 --> 49:18.615
Well, I think that was an overreaction.

49:20.166 --> 49:22.006
Just make sure you stay here
while I'm at work.

49:22.209 --> 49:26.418
And you can watch TV
and eat and relax.

49:26.505 --> 49:29.372
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Just stay here.

49:29.467 --> 49:30.467
Narrator: "Stay here"?

49:30.634 --> 49:34.547
George is king of the jungle. No four
walls built by modern man can contain him.

49:34.680 --> 49:38.889
Not true. George have every intention
of doing exactly what Ursula say.

49:38.976 --> 49:40.716
Really? Is that so?

49:41.979 --> 49:42.979
For a while.

49:44.023 --> 49:45.729
And at that very moment,

49:45.816 --> 49:49.434
Betsy and Ursula were on their way to
break the news about Lyle to her father.

49:49.570 --> 49:50.855
Good luck, kiddo.

49:51.405 --> 49:52.805
- Surprise!
- Aaah!

49:56.869 --> 49:59.861
Ursula, welcome home, sweetheart,

50:00.498 --> 50:02.830
and happy engagement day.

50:03.334 --> 50:04.949
Chock full o' nuts

50:05.044 --> 50:07.877
the heavenly coffee

50:08.672 --> 50:10.663
announcer:
The coffee that brings you together.

50:10.925 --> 50:13.132
When you're in love

50:14.929 --> 50:16.294
now George understand.

50:16.388 --> 50:19.425
George get coffee,
then Ursula want George.

50:32.905 --> 50:34.941
Java-java-java-java,
java-java-java-java.

50:35.032 --> 50:38.365
So the low has moved offshore.
High pressure's built a Ridge in.

50:38.452 --> 50:40.659
The weather is absolutely gorgeous.

50:40.746 --> 50:43.328
- If you're not outside, you oughta be!
- Who, me?

50:43.541 --> 50:45.748
- I mean you.
- Oh.

50:45.834 --> 50:47.665
Okay!

50:47.753 --> 50:50.210
Narrator:
And so, jazzed on java,

50:50.297 --> 50:54.006
George of the jungle made his way
into the city by the bay.

50:54.093 --> 50:57.756
Whoo!

50:58.305 --> 50:59.920
Quickly taking to tourism,

51:00.015 --> 51:02.973
the jungle king enjoyed the first
drive-through dining of his life

51:03.060 --> 51:06.928
and strolled the city streets until
he found something so scintillating

51:07.022 --> 51:09.104
he had to say: - Ooh!

51:10.192 --> 51:11.648
Yeah!

51:19.618 --> 51:21.904
But nothing excited the jungle king more

51:21.996 --> 51:24.908
than the sight of the biggest
rope bridge he had ever seen.

51:25.040 --> 51:28.749
Ooh. Yeah.

51:49.398 --> 51:51.389
- Man: Help!
- Ooh.

51:51.483 --> 51:53.474
Somebody help!

52:05.831 --> 52:08.914
To swing or not to swing?

52:09.001 --> 52:10.411
Man: Help!

52:13.505 --> 52:14.620
Swing.

52:24.600 --> 52:29.515
As the king of the jungle calculated
the angle and velocity of his big swing,

52:29.605 --> 52:32.893
Ursula felt like jumping
off a bridge herself.

52:32.983 --> 52:36.851
I feel so guilty.
I don't know what I'm going to do.

52:36.945 --> 52:40.858
First thing: I suggest you tell your
father what you came here to tell him.

52:41.533 --> 52:42.864
- Hi, daddy.
- Hi, honey.

52:42.951 --> 52:47.445
Take a look at this. The most remarkable
thing is happening on the bay bridge.

52:47.539 --> 52:50.372
Where strong winds
have carried him to the bay bridge.

52:50.459 --> 52:52.620
Valerie devlin is live
on the scene.

52:53.128 --> 52:54.163
Thank you, terilyn.

52:54.254 --> 52:56.916
We do have a breaking story
at the bay bridge,

52:57.007 --> 53:00.966
where a parasailer dangles helplessly,
500 feet above the water.

53:01.053 --> 53:03.840
Help!

53:06.350 --> 53:08.807
Reporter: There's no word
on who this lone daredevil is.

53:08.894 --> 53:11.806
- Ursula: That's George.
- He appears to have some kind of rope.

53:11.897 --> 53:14.889
- He might be preparing to swing on it.
- I gotta go.

53:32.835 --> 53:35.793
Excuse me, sir.
I have to get on this boat.

53:47.224 --> 53:50.842
Hey, fella. George of jungle. Need a vine?

53:50.936 --> 53:54.520
Thanks a lot, man.
Get me out of this stuff, huh?

54:00.904 --> 54:03.520
- Thanks, man.
- Oh, don't mention it.

54:03.615 --> 54:07.654
King of jungle only here to help!

54:07.745 --> 54:09.531
Whoa!

54:09.621 --> 54:12.533
Oh! Oh-oh-oh!

54:13.709 --> 54:16.826
- George!
- Ursula! Ow!

54:37.566 --> 54:39.898
All: Watch out for that...

54:39.985 --> 54:41.976
Aaah!

54:47.075 --> 54:48.861
- George!
- Ursula!

54:48.952 --> 54:51.864
What are you doing? Are you okay?
You just saved that man's life!

54:51.955 --> 54:54.571
George just lucky, I guess.

54:56.668 --> 54:59.205
Ooh. This coffee stuff
really work good.

55:00.464 --> 55:03.922
One of the most daring rescues
ever recorded live on television.

55:04.468 --> 55:07.380
This is Valerie devlin reporting to you
from under the bay bridge.

55:07.471 --> 55:08.927
- Back to you, terilyn.
- Hmm?

55:09.014 --> 55:12.427
You know, they say the city by the bay
is the most romantic in the world,

55:12.518 --> 55:15.931
and it looks as though there's a little
romance unfolding under the bay bridge.

55:16.021 --> 55:17.602
- We"ll be back in a moment.
- Oh.

55:18.982 --> 55:21.598
Narrator: Meanwhile, back in the jungle...

55:21.693 --> 55:23.399
Thor:
There's five stinkin' apes out there.

55:23.487 --> 55:24.943
Which one are we takin' to Vegas?

55:25.489 --> 55:27.275
The one who's playing chess.

55:27.366 --> 55:30.278
Checkmate.

55:34.706 --> 55:36.537
- Yes!
- Sweet dreams, banana breath.

55:36.625 --> 55:38.536
Tookie.

55:38.627 --> 55:40.663
Go find George.

55:49.012 --> 55:52.129
- Hmm?
- Thor.

55:58.522 --> 56:01.184
Let's get him in the cage
while he's still under. Come on.

56:04.319 --> 56:07.061
Narrator: As the pesky poachers
grunted and groaned,

56:07.155 --> 56:10.067
pushing and pulling
the ponderous primate along,

56:10.158 --> 56:14.071
the trusty tookie-tookie bird
was already winging to the rescue,

56:14.162 --> 56:17.074
making a bird-line for San Francisco

56:17.165 --> 56:20.407
where George of the jungle
was trying to give the heiress Ursula

56:20.502 --> 56:22.584
the courage to face her parents

56:22.671 --> 56:26.755
by helping her discover the juju within.

56:26.842 --> 56:30.300
- Make jungle call. Then you feel brave.
- No, I can't.

56:30.387 --> 56:33.675
- Come on. Big breath. Support voice.
- No, no, no. No!

56:33.765 --> 56:36.347
- Please. Please?
- I can't do it.

56:36.435 --> 56:39.768
Big. Brave. Queen of jungle.
Come on, Ursula.

56:52.326 --> 56:54.692
- Wow.
- Not bad for beginner.

56:54.995 --> 56:57.202
Narrator:
Emboldened with jungle juju,

57:00.709 --> 57:02.290
who took it extremely well.

57:02.377 --> 57:05.995
Mother, daddy,
I love you both very much.

57:06.214 --> 57:08.455
I have something
very important to tell you,

57:08.550 --> 57:10.506
and I hope you'll understand.

57:10.594 --> 57:13.051
I don't want to marry Lyle
anymore.

57:19.227 --> 57:20.307
Narrator: Just kidding.

57:20.395 --> 57:24.308
Aaah!

57:24.441 --> 57:26.648
The young miss stanhope
proceeded to spill the beans...

57:26.735 --> 57:29.067
I went to the jungle...

57:29.154 --> 57:31.065
Very quickly,

57:38.580 --> 57:41.322
Until she got to the important part
at the end.

57:41.500 --> 57:46.210
Then Lyle shot him. So Lyle is in jail,
and George is with me,

57:47.631 --> 57:49.337
and I don't want to marry Lyle anymore.

57:49.591 --> 57:53.209
I knew it. It's that swinging man
from the bridge.

57:53.303 --> 57:55.419
I saw you smooching on TV.

57:55.514 --> 57:58.597
- Mother, we weren't smooching...
- How could you do this to me?

57:58.684 --> 58:01.471
Don't you realize the caliber of people
who are going to be here?

58:01.561 --> 58:02.997
Calm down, Beatrice, and let her say...

58:03.021 --> 58:06.809
I thought we would be introducing them
to Lyle Van de groot,

58:06.900 --> 58:09.391
not some wild man you found in the jungle.

58:09.486 --> 58:12.023
Beatrice, this is supposed to be
her wedding, not yours.

58:12.155 --> 58:14.897
- So?
- Beatrice, I know you're upset.

58:14.992 --> 58:18.405
So am I, but we can't force her
to marry someone against her will.

58:18.495 --> 58:21.612
- Why not?
- Mom. Dad.

58:21.707 --> 58:23.663
I'm ready to go out there and apologize

58:23.750 --> 58:25.630
to everybody
and tell them what really happened.

58:25.836 --> 58:27.622
Absolutely not!

58:27.713 --> 58:31.877
As far as I'm concerned, you...
You caught one of those viruses.

58:31.967 --> 58:34.424
Yes, one of those dreadful jungle viruses

58:34.511 --> 58:36.718
that get nice girls all confused.

58:36.805 --> 58:41.390
If Lyle survives that awful jail, you
will simply have to kiss and make up.

58:41.476 --> 58:45.640
As for this evening, we will hold
our heads high and we will carry on.

58:45.731 --> 58:49.223
Now, darling, where is that charming
young friend of yours?

58:49.985 --> 58:52.567
- Well, where is he?
- I don't know. He's around here someplace.

58:52.654 --> 58:54.235
Well, find him. We haven't got all day.

58:54.322 --> 58:56.904
Oh, Ursula, look! How wonderful!

58:56.992 --> 59:01.076
And look at Richard's exquisite
figurines of you and darling Lyle.

59:04.166 --> 59:06.248
George, watch out for that...

59:14.843 --> 59:17.630
Mom. Dad. This is George.

59:17.721 --> 59:19.803
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Ursula.

59:19.890 --> 59:21.676
How do you do?

59:36.531 --> 59:39.864
It is always such a pleasure
to see you, Mr. mayor.

59:39.951 --> 59:42.363
It's so nice to get away from city hall

59:42.454 --> 59:44.866
and be around some normal people
for a change.

59:44.956 --> 59:47.618
Well, we are perfectly normal,
I assure you

59:47.709 --> 59:49.916
in an exceptional way, of course.

59:50.337 --> 59:51.452
Of course.

59:51.713 --> 59:53.704
- And what about this guy, Lyle?
- Mm-hmm.

59:53.799 --> 59:57.883
I'd really like to meet the man you deem
good enough to marry your daughter.

59:57.969 --> 01:00:01.052
Well, unfortunately, Lyle
is busy at the moment

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:02.754
tending to some legal affairs.

01:00:02.849 --> 01:00:06.842
- Some pété, Mr. mayor?
- You know, I never touch that stuff.

01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:08.312
Oh.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:11.859
- I had a lovely time. Excuse me Dr. fogel.
- Would you excuse us, please?

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:14.684
It's 7:30. Do you know
where your jungle man is?

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.573
So this is what you were doing
in the jungle. Clever girl.

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:26.199
Yeah. Um, he swung me on vines
and fed me coconut milk.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:29.372
- I knew it.
- He's not a real meat loaf, is he?

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:32.166
No. I mean, he's not brainy

01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:35.121
in that doctor, lawyer, banker way,

01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:36.830
but he has something else.

01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:40.459
- He has a...
- Sensual intelligence.

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:43.545
Woman: "Sensual intelligence."

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:47.137
- Wow.
- Oh, my god.

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:50.135
What is it with chicks and horses, huh?

01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:11.118
George, how are you this evening?

01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:17.583
Pretty sharp threads there,
uh, George, right?

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:20.002
- Where are you based?
- The jungle.

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:23.005
I hear ya.
We cut our teeth in New York also.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:26.054
You're considering a position
with stanhope? That could be fruitful.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:29.300
Fruitful? This place not so fruitful.
Nobody have big coconuts.

01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:37.812
- George, I wan...
- Mmm?

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:39.814
Oh. Would you mind

01:01:39.905 --> 01:01:41.816
stepping outside with me...

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:44.614
Thank you so much...
For just a moment?

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:46.612
Sure.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.445
Ella: Hello, Beatrice.

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:51.992
Hello, Ella.

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:54.578
We haven't been friends
for very long, George,

01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:57.251
but I already think
I know something about you.

01:01:57.339 --> 01:01:58.339
Oh?

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:01.798
You are in love with my daughter.

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:04.838
Mrs. Ursula not so dumb.

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.591
Charming.

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:12.517
My concern, however, is that Ursula
seems to reciprocate your feelings,

01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:14.936
and that does present a problem to me.

01:02:16.775 --> 01:02:20.313
You see, you and Ursula together

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:23.315
would be unbefitting her social stature.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:24.907
You see?

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:28.108
Let me put it in a way
you might understand.

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:32.162
Where you come from,
zebras marry zebras,

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:34.365
and leopards marry leopards.

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:37.326
Stripes with stripes, spots with spots.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.411
Well, Ursula is a stripe

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:41.629
and you are a spot,

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:45.918
one which I intend to have
removed as soon as possible.

01:02:47.347 --> 01:02:50.054
So you no want Ursula to love George.

01:02:50.141 --> 01:02:53.725
I would rather have my tongue nailed to
this table every morning at breakfast.

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:55.803
- That hurt.
- Not as much as you will

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:57.977
if you do anything to screw up
my daughter's marriage

01:02:58.024 --> 01:02:59.309
to Lyle Van de groot.

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:03.485
When Lyle returns,
this wedding will proceed as planned.

01:03:03.571 --> 01:03:05.778
If you do anything to upset that,

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:10.863
I will remove your reason
for wearing a loin cloth.

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:14.453
Steak tartare, Mrs. stanhope?

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:18.409
Oh, no, thank you.
I've had quite enough protein for today.

01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:20.418
Have a pleasant evening, Mr. jungle.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:45.444
Mmm?

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.901
Tookie? Tookie!

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:53.736
Tookie! George so happy
to see tookie.

01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:59.537
Ape kidnapped?

01:03:59.627 --> 01:04:01.288
Ape ape-napped?

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:03.791
George save ape!

01:04:06.134 --> 01:04:07.134
Ursula.

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:07.150
Beatrice: Of course he went back
to the jungle. Where else would he go?

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:08.237
The hague?

01:05:08.363 --> 01:05:10.354
But why would he leave
without saying good-bye?

01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:14.696
Well, personally, I think he acted
rather sensibly. Showed good character.

01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:18.153
He understands that he belongs there,
you belong here.

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:21.706
It's really all a question
of stripes and spots.

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:24.875
What? Oh, no.

01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:27.500
You got to him.
Mother, what did you say?

01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:30.715
I simply said that
if he really cared for you,

01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:35.136
he'd leave you alone, let you get on
with your life and marry Lyle.

01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:36.884
I am not marrying Lyle, mother.

01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:38.636
Beatrice, perhaps we should...
“Arthur!

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:41.058
Now, Ursula, darling, don't be ridiculous.

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:44.889
There's a difference between marriageable
material and a fling in the jungle.

01:05:44.983 --> 01:05:47.645
"A fling in the jungle"?
A fling in the jungle?

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:50.063
Who says I had a fling in the jungle?

01:05:50.155 --> 01:05:52.771
You don't think you can
fool your mother, do you?

01:05:53.032 --> 01:05:56.570
You've been head over heels for that ape
ever since you brought him here.

01:05:56.661 --> 01:06:00.245
Now, Ursula, that kind
of love is fleeting.

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:01.616
You'll get over it.

01:06:08.715 --> 01:06:10.000
Did you just say "love"?

01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:12.923
- No.
- You did.

01:06:13.011 --> 01:06:14.011
Ursula!

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:15.156
- You're right.
- Don't say it.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.171
I love him. I'm outta here.

01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:20.678
Ursula, you can't love him!
Arthur, say something.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:22.509
Be careful out there, honey.

01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:24.344
- What?
- Good-bye, daddy.

01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:27.226
- I love you.
- I love you, mom.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:29.148
- Thank you.
- Oh, Ursula...

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:31.601
- Arthur, do something!
- What would you have me do?

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:34.904
- There's obviously no stopping her.
- Oh, god!

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:42.704
- Ursula!
- God, that woman's a pain in the ass.

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:48.201
Narrator:
Meanwhile, halfway across the world,

01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:50.207
another ass was feeling pain

01:06:50.298 --> 01:06:53.210
as an ape named ape
was caged in a cage,

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:55.883
hoping to hear
the jungle king's awesome...

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:03.220
Hey, I'm pretty good at that.

01:07:03.937 --> 01:07:05.677
And wondering if he would ever come.

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:08.392
But the motion-sick mammal
needn't have moaned,

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:11.478
for that defender of the innocent,
protector of the weak

01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:16.438
and all-around good guy, George
of the jungle, was closer than he knew.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.162
Next time George get bigger box.

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:30.994
Ooh.

01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:28.225
Oh! Bad luck.

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:32.930
- Hmm.
- Did you hear something?

01:08:33.026 --> 01:08:35.233
- What?
- I heard a noise.

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:42.233
I think I chipped a tooth.

01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:45.069
_oh!

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:47.154
- Ah.
- Oh, Thor!

01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:49.738
- You're disgusting.
- That wasn't me.

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:51.243
Not me.

01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:17.392
I'm hungry.

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:21.776
Shut up! You been yakkin' for two days
straight, and I'm mad enough to...

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:24.107
You really should work on your anger.

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:27.451
Have you tried brankowski's
"cage the rage" technique?

01:09:27.537 --> 01:09:29.620
Don't let him get to you, Thor.

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:33.416
- He's just an ape.
- Fine way to talk to your meal ticket.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:36.415
You keep that up, it's liable
to affect my stage performance.

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:39.167
Give him a banana, Thor.
Won't be long now.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.131
That's what you said yesterday.

01:09:41.219 --> 01:09:43.551
This trail's taking us
to the middle of nowhere!

01:09:43.638 --> 01:09:46.970
The sign at the trail head
said "short cut to ape river."

01:09:47.058 --> 01:09:50.015
Now, why would it say
"short cut" if it wasn't a...

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:51.770
Wait a minute.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:55.601
Maybe it's a fake, a decoy trail.

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:58.980
Very good, Max.
Actually, the trail is a fake.

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:02.062
It circles ape mountain six times

01:10:02.156 --> 01:10:04.238
before heading right back
to the tree house.

01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:07.032
Oh, I knew we was lost!

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.237
Don't listen to him, Thor.
He's just trying to trick us.

01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:13.744
Lead us off the short cut so we take
twice as long on the regular trail.

01:10:13.835 --> 01:10:16.247
We're already takin' twice as long!

01:10:16.337 --> 01:10:19.295
Are you gonna let a monkey
make a monkey out of ya?

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:20.417
What?

01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:23.625
- Duh!
- Let's go.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.087
If he tells us the short cut leads
to the tree house,

01:10:27.181 --> 01:10:30.014
then that's exactly where it doesn't lead.

01:10:39.610 --> 01:10:40.690
Ape?

01:11:04.385 --> 01:11:06.376
Poor ape-napped brother.

01:11:06.471 --> 01:11:08.553
Carefully!

01:11:08.639 --> 01:11:11.847
Max, look. We're back at the tree house.

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:16.849
Well, I tried, but you fellas
are just too smart for me.

01:11:16.939 --> 01:11:18.725
Oh, no!

01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:21.211
Narrator: "Oh, no" was right,
for the exhausted ape-nappers...

01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:25.319
Why don't you say something constructive
for a change like what we should do now.

01:11:25.406 --> 01:11:27.317
Narrator:
Because I don't like you.

01:11:27.408 --> 01:11:30.491
- Well, I hate you, you snotty son of a...
- I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

01:11:30.578 --> 01:11:33.866
Narrator: Having some fun now, hmm?

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:35.821
Thor, were you fighting with the narrator?

01:11:35.917 --> 01:11:37.436
- Well, he started it.
- Narrator: Did not.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.200
- You did too!
- Did not!

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:40.535
- You did too!
- Did not!

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.086
- You did too!
- Thor! Stop it!

01:11:42.173 --> 01:11:44.380
Thor: That's it!
I'm not draggin' this another inch!

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:46.111
Max: What are you doing?!
Get back there and work!

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:48.015
- Where you going?
- You wretched little weasel!

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:50.719
Don't you call me a weasel,
you big brontosaurus!

01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:59.433
- Let's take care of him.
- Huh? Huh?

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:01.435
Whoal!

01:12:01.526 --> 01:12:03.437
Why didn't you come sooner?

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:05.393
Why ape have little stars around head?

01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:11.194
George, remember everything
I taught you

01:12:11.285 --> 01:12:13.196
about queensberry rules and fighting fair?

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:15.778
- Uh-huh.
- Well, now's a good time to forget it.

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:17.409
Let's finish him off.

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:20.749
Hyah!

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:26.707
- I can't breathe, Max.
- Let it out, Thor. Let it out!

01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:30.418
Aaah!

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:35.173
- Right, jungle boy!
- Aaah!

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:41.308
- Whoal!
- Oh!

01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:44.391
Oh!

01:12:51.576 --> 01:12:53.988
- Huh?
- Huh?

01:13:02.336 --> 01:13:04.918
Hmm?

01:13:07.174 --> 01:13:10.416
Ah!

01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:14.337
Yah!

01:13:14.432 --> 01:13:17.970
- Aaah! Aaah!
- Whoa-ooh!

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.972
Huh? Mmm. Mmm.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:23.475
Yaaah!

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:26.433
Aaah-aaah!
Eee-eee! Tookie-tookie!

01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:30.945
- Take this!
- Stop it! Ape! Aaah!

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:45.202
Aaah! Yaah! Yaah!

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:51.333
Get it off! Get it off me, Max!

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:09.646
All right!

01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:13.191
Shep! Look out!

01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:18.234
Ursula?

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:21.161
Oh!

01:14:21.248 --> 01:14:22.738
Ooh!

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:25.165
George good teacher!

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:29.333
Aaah!

01:14:29.423 --> 01:14:31.835
George. George.

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:34.421
I came all this way
to tell you that...

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:37.754
- Ursula talk later. George busy now.
- Oh!

01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:41.765
- What?
- Fella got toucan on can.

01:14:41.852 --> 01:14:44.013
I know.

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:08.785
Ha ha ha! Good show, George!

01:15:08.879 --> 01:15:10.790
And you too, tookie!

01:15:10.881 --> 01:15:12.792
My hero.

01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:15.879
Did I just say that?

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:17.961
Ape: George!

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:21.263
- Over here, George!
- Ape, sit tight. George be right back.

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.090
Oh, I say.

01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:33.150
Now George can talk.

01:15:33.237 --> 01:15:35.649
What Ursula come back to say?

01:15:37.825 --> 01:15:39.486
Only that

01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:41.943
I know in my heart

01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:46.156
that I really, truly...

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:48.164
Haven't seen the light yet.

01:15:48.252 --> 01:15:50.083
Yle?

01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:51.377
Narrator: Yes, Lyle.

01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:54.622
For the venal Van de groot
has escaped from the Bujumbura jail

01:15:54.759 --> 01:15:57.876
and joined an obscure cult
on the shores of lake tanganyika,

01:15:58.012 --> 01:16:00.754
which had empowered him
with a peculiar piece of parchment.

01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:04.849
- What are you doing here?
- Surprised, my little cupcake?

01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:07.017
You see, I'm now a mail-order minister,

01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:11.063
ordained in the church of celestial
power and light, incorporated.

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:16.440
Capable of performing legally binding
marriage ceremonies anywhere.

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:20.068
- Lyle, I'm not marrying you.
- Actually, you are. Come on, let's go.

01:16:20.284 --> 01:16:22.164
- Come along, my little African queen.
- George.

01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:25.036
Now George really mad!
George tear off your...

01:16:28.793 --> 01:16:30.704
Mercenary: Everybody freeze now!

01:16:31.378 --> 01:16:33.790
Operation completed as ordered, sir.

01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:38.250
Thank you, Gunnar, gunter,
hans, jan and Phil.

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:44.468
No hard feelings, stone belly.
The best man won, that's all.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:47.766
I should say the guy who brought
mercenaries won. That's all.

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:52.267
Okay, honey. Ready to go? I got a boat
waitin' to take us to Bujumbura.

01:16:52.817 --> 01:16:54.853
- George.
- Ursula.

01:16:55.236 --> 01:16:57.568
Don't go that way! Go that way!

01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:00.025
- Aaah!
- See ya later.

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:01.343
George! “Adios. Auf wiedersehen.

01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:04.029
- Stop it! Stop it!
- George: Ursula!

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.452
Lyle, let go of Mel

01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:08.655
come on. Come on.

01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:12.499
Oo00-000! Eee-eee! Aaah-aaah!

01:17:36.694 --> 01:17:40.357
Bongo-gram! Work every time.

01:17:40.447 --> 01:17:42.608
Good work, brother apes.

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:44.691
Now listen very carefully to George.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:56.171
Let er rip, shep!

01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:03.380
Ursula: No! Stop it, Lyle!

01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:05.552
Come on.

01:18:05.639 --> 01:18:07.550
Stop it! You're such a jerk!

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:10.383
Oh! Ow! Ooh!

01:18:10.477 --> 01:18:12.593
Come here!

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:19.059
You know, I forgive you and I'm willing
to give you yet another chance.

01:18:19.153 --> 01:18:21.485
Lyle, you don't know where you're go...

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:52.842
You see?

01:18:52.937 --> 01:18:55.223
I told you I'd have a boat waiting.

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:09.984
Aaah!

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:11.535
Oh! Oh!

01:19:21.632 --> 01:19:24.590
Okay, then. All righty.

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:28.218
Reverend Lyle, ready to
perform the ceremony.

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:30.216
Do you, Ursula stanhope,

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:32.423
take me, Lyle Van de groot,

01:19:32.518 --> 01:19:34.429
to be your lawful wedded husband?

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.976
Get a grip, Lyle.

01:19:44.321 --> 01:19:46.357
- Lyle.
- Yeah, honey?

01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:50.233
- Lyle.
- Oh, my god!

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:54.695
Help!

01:20:05.092 --> 01:20:08.004
Lyle!

01:20:14.351 --> 01:20:15.591
Thanks, tookie.

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:21.180
This biggest swing in jungle history.

01:20:21.275 --> 01:20:22.981
Will hurt very much,

01:20:23.777 --> 01:20:25.108
but George have to do it.

01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:04.644
George! “What the...

01:21:08.906 --> 01:21:10.112
This gonna hurt.

01:21:11.075 --> 01:21:13.691
George, watch out for that tree!

01:21:18.582 --> 01:21:20.322
George not feel so good.

01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:39.808
Lyle: Oh, thank god
we've made it.

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:42.102
Say I do, Ursula.

01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:44.100
Ahh! That's it. We're married.

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:46.102
Now to look at my bride.

01:21:47.111 --> 01:21:49.898
No!

01:21:55.619 --> 01:21:58.031
No! No!

01:21:58.122 --> 01:22:01.159
No!

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:02.365
George,

01:22:03.627 --> 01:22:06.585
what I came here to say
was that I love you.

01:22:08.298 --> 01:22:10.129
Ursula love George?

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:12.257
So much.

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:15.210
George love Ursula too.

01:22:17.182 --> 01:22:21.175
Narrator: And so George of the jungle
received the first kiss of his life

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:23.807
that came from neither
elephant nor ape.

01:22:25.816 --> 01:22:27.772
And on the following new moon,

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:32.027
Ursula stanhope finally got
the simple wedding she had hoped for

01:22:32.114 --> 01:22:37.074
as the San Francisco heiress and king
of the jungle joined their hearts forever

01:22:37.161 --> 01:22:38.651
in wedded bliss.

01:22:41.331 --> 01:22:43.242
The rings!

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:45.324
- The rings.
- The rings?

01:22:45.419 --> 01:22:47.284
Tookie?

01:23:10.736 --> 01:23:13.603
Arthur, I wish you'd do something
about all these monkeys.

01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:15.062
I feel like Jane goodall.

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:18.607
Madam, I knew Jane goodall,

01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:21.114
and you are no Jane goodall.

01:23:25.792 --> 01:23:28.704
I got it! Whoo!

01:23:28.795 --> 01:23:30.956
Aaah!

01:23:35.636 --> 01:23:37.376
Listenin' to some inner call

01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:41.714
swimmin' blindly to throw myself
upon your shore

01:23:41.808 --> 01:23:44.220
I think I know why
the dog howls at the moon

01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:48.891
I think I know why
the dog howls at the moon

01:23:50.234 --> 01:23:55.149
I sing dela, dela

01:23:55.239 --> 01:23:57.525

01:23:57.616 --> 01:23:59.948

01:24:05.082 --> 01:24:07.243

01:24:10.170 --> 01:24:12.661
I been waiting for you all my life

01:24:12.756 --> 01:24:14.621
hoping for a miracle

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:17.048
I been waiting day and night

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:18.591
day and night

01:24:19.763 --> 01:24:21.754
I been waiting for you all my life

01:24:22.266 --> 01:24:23.847
waiting for redemption

01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:26.140
I been waiting day and night

01:24:26.228 --> 01:24:28.219
I burn for you

01:24:33.318 --> 01:24:35.229
- Ursula: I love you.
- George: Good boy.

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.231
Narrator: And so ends our tale

01:24:37.322 --> 01:24:38.858
of that defender of the innocent,

01:24:38.949 --> 01:24:42.316
protector of the weak
and all-around good guy,

01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:44.322
George of the jungle.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.947
A noble king, his beautiful queen

01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:50.953
and their nimble young heir
to the jungle throne.

01:24:51.044 --> 01:24:52.204
George, watch out for that...

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:55.295
I know what you're thinking.

01:24:55.465 --> 01:24:59.674
How does a baby raised by an ape grow up
to be king of the jungle,

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:03.128
find his queen and live
happily ever after?

01:25:03.974 --> 01:25:05.714
George just lucky, I guess.

01:25:08.478 --> 01:25:10.594
George, George
George of the jungle

01:25:10.689 --> 01:25:12.304
strong as he can be

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:15.023
AAA-AAA-aaah!

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.771
Watch out for that tree

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:19.562
George, George
George of the jungle

01:25:19.656 --> 01:25:21.271
lives a life that's free

01:25:21.908 --> 01:25:24.240
ape: Wait a moment! Wait, wait!

01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:26.364
Don't you want to know
what happened to me?

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:43.718
And now the end is near

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:47.548
and so I face the final curtain

01:25:47.643 --> 01:25:51.101
my friends I'll say it clear

01:25:51.188 --> 01:25:54.180
I'll state my case
of which I'm certain

01:25:54.733 --> 01:25:57.816
I've lived a life that's full

01:25:57.944 --> 01:26:01.607
I've traveled each and every highway

01:26:01.698 --> 01:26:04.781
and more much more than this

01:26:04.868 --> 01:26:08.952
whoo - I did it my way! Yes!

01:26:09.039 --> 01:26:12.531
There were times
I'm sure you knew

01:26:12.626 --> 01:26:16.039
when I bit off more than I could chew

01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:19.417
but through it all
when there was doubt

01:26:19.508 --> 01:26:22.875
I ate it up and spit it out

01:26:23.428 --> 01:26:26.795
I faced it all and I stood tall

01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:30.633
and did it my way

01:26:31.228 --> 01:26:32.764
doo-doo-doo

01:26:37.234 --> 01:26:39.350
George, George
George of the jungle

01:26:39.444 --> 01:26:41.651
strong as he can be

01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:43.945
AAA-AAA-aaah!

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:46.114
Watch out for that tree

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:48.362
George, George
George of the jungle

01:26:48.453 --> 01:26:50.114

01:26:50.789 --> 01:26:52.825
AAA-AAA-aaah!

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:54.747
Watch out for that tree

01:26:54.835 --> 01:26:57.042
when he gets in a scrape
he makes his escape

01:26:57.129 --> 01:26:59.541
with help from his friend
an ape named ape

01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:02.797
and his elephant shep
can fetch a log

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:05.216
he's man's best friend
he's George's dog

01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:08.588
he's George, George
George of the jungle

01:27:08.682 --> 01:27:10.138
strong as he can be

01:27:10.934 --> 01:27:13.095
AAA-AAA-aaah!

01:27:13.186 --> 01:27:15.268
Watch out for that tree

01:27:15.355 --> 01:27:17.516
George, George
George of the jungle

01:27:17.607 --> 01:27:19.313
friend to you and me

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:22.067
AAA-AAA-aaah!

01:27:22.154 --> 01:27:24.190
Watch out for that tree

01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:26.192
hear him holler swing and sing

01:27:26.283 --> 01:27:28.865
all the animals come
to the jungle king

01:27:29.786 --> 01:27:31.947
so grab a vine and swing in time

01:27:32.038 --> 01:27:34.450
if you slam a tree
just pay no mind

01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:37.833
like George, George
George of the jungle

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:40.035
George, George
George of the jungle

01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:42.291
George, George
George of the jungle

01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:44.543
George, George
George of the jungle

01:27:44.634 --> 01:27:46.795
George, George

01:27:46.887 --> 01:27:49.003
George, George
George of the jungle

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:51.258
George, George
George of the jungle

01:27:51.349 --> 01:27:53.431
George, George
George of the jungle

01:27:53.518 --> 01:27:55.725
George, George
George of the jungle

01:27:55.812 --> 01:27:57.973
George, George
George of the jungle

01:27:58.064 --> 01:28:00.100
George, George
George of the jungle

01:28:00.192 --> 01:28:02.399
George, George
George of the jungle

01:28:02.486 --> 01:28:04.568
George, George
George of the jungle

01:28:04.654 --> 01:28:06.519
swing from tree to tree

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:10.945
watch out for that tree

01:28:11.495 --> 01:28:13.702
George, George
George of the jungle

01:28:13.789 --> 01:28:15.404
lives a life that's free

01:28:16.041 --> 01:28:18.202
AAA-AAA-aaah!

01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:19.954
Watch out for that tree

01:28:20.504 --> 01:28:22.995
left in the wild was a baby
with a smile named George

01:28:23.089 --> 01:28:25.000
who stayed for quite a while

01:28:25.842 --> 01:28:28.049
and George grew up
in the trees above

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:30.593
when Ursula found him
they found love

01:28:31.389 --> 01:28:33.675
she took him to the city
took him straight downtown

01:28:33.767 --> 01:28:36.099
but the concrete bliss
brought poor George down

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:39.227
so it's back to the jungle
for a wedding in the green

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:41.976
for the king and queen
of the animal scene

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:46.101
George, George
George of the jungle

01:28:46.196 --> 01:28:48.027

01:28:48.406 --> 01:28:50.692
AAA-AAA-aaah!

01:28:50.784 --> 01:28:52.900
Watch out for that tree

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:56.907
watch out for that...
Bang! Ooh! Tree

01:29:05.382 --> 01:29:07.623
George, George
George of the jungle

01:29:07.717 --> 01:29:09.503
watch out for that tree

01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:36.692
Ape: Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the king of the jungle.
