WEBVTT

00:00.601 --> 00:03.537
(Benny coughing)

00:05.706 --> 00:07.175
FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY,

00:07.175 --> 00:09.477
NOW THAT GRANDMA BENNY'S
LIVING WITH US,

00:09.477 --> 00:11.512
DON'T TALK TO HER
IN THE MORNING.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.148
OH, AND DON'T PET HER
WHILE SHE'S EATING.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.649
SHE'LL SNAP AT YOU.

00:15.649 --> 00:19.387
GOOD MORNING, BENNY.
HOW ARE YOU HOLDIN' UP?

00:19.387 --> 00:22.623
IT'S CALLED A BRA.
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.330
WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

00:29.330 --> 00:31.332
I THOUGHT I'D SEE
HOW SHE'S FEELING

00:31.332 --> 00:33.701
AFTER HER HOUSE BURNT DOWN.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.169
ARE YOU CRYING, MOM?

00:35.169 --> 00:37.438
NO, YOU ARE.
SHUT UP.

00:39.707 --> 00:43.411
(coughing and hacking)

00:43.411 --> 00:46.514
YOU CAN THROW OUT
YOUR ALARM CLOCKS, KIDS.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.782
THAT'S YOUR
NEW PHLEGM ROOSTER.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.254
(Benny coughs)

00:53.254 --> 00:55.923
WAIT FOR IT. WAIT FOR IT.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.758
(Benny hawks phlegm)

00:57.758 --> 01:00.494
(spits and grunts)

01:02.196 --> 01:03.297
(knock on door)

01:03.297 --> 01:04.598
HEY. MORNING.

01:04.598 --> 01:07.235
GOOD MORNING.
WHAT'S WITH THE CAN?

01:07.235 --> 01:09.103
OH, I HIT THE NEIGHBORHOOD
TO TRY AND RAISE MONEY

01:09.103 --> 01:10.471
FOR YOUR MOM.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.473
I TOLD EVERYONE
HOW SHE'D LOST HER SAVINGS

01:12.473 --> 01:14.074
WHEN HER HOUSE BURNED DOWN

01:14.074 --> 01:17.145
AND THAT ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY
WILL HELP, NO MATTER HOW SMALL.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.412
ERNIE, THIS CAN'S EMPTY.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.349
YEAH, I KNOW.
SHE'S NOT WELL-LIKED.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.085
OH, THERE WERE SOME
NOTES, THOUGH.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.787
CHECK IT OUT...

01:26.787 --> 01:28.088
"YOU DESERVE IT."

01:28.088 --> 01:30.358
"YOU HAD IT COMING."

01:31.725 --> 01:34.695
"WHAT THE HELL DOES GOD HAVE
TO DO TO FINISH YOU OFF?"

01:36.597 --> 01:41.135
OH, "I HOPE
YOU BUILD A NEW HOUSE..."
WELL, THAT'S NOT BAD.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.936
"BUT THIS TIME
THE WINDOWS ARE PAINTED SHUT

01:42.936 --> 01:45.105
"SO YOU'RE TRAPPED INSIDE
AND YOU BURN ALIVE

01:45.105 --> 01:47.107
"LIKE THE WICKED WITCH
YOU ARE."

01:47.107 --> 01:48.609
WHO SIGNED THAT?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.611
I WANT TO SEND HIM
A CHRISTMAS CARD.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.314
ACTUALLY, A WHOLE LOT
OF PEOPLE SIGNED IT.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.716
IT'S MORE LIKE A PETITION.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.422
BENNY, I'M GOING
SHOPPING TODAY.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.457
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING
TO GET YOU STARTED?

02:03.457 --> 02:07.161
EVERYTHING.
TOOTHPASTE, DEODORANT,

02:07.161 --> 02:09.062
UNDERWEAR, WHISKEY--

02:09.062 --> 02:12.466
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
IF YOU GET ME ENOUGH WHISKEY,

02:12.466 --> 02:14.702
I WON'T EVEN CARE
ABOUT THE UNDERWEAR.

02:17.871 --> 02:19.106
MAN, POOR BENNY.

02:19.106 --> 02:21.041
I CAN'T IMAGINE
LOSING EVERYTHING

02:21.041 --> 02:22.876
AND HAVING
TO START ALL OVER.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.679
YEAH. IT'D BE TOUGH TO LOSE
THOSE "SPEED RACER" SHEETS

02:25.679 --> 02:28.549
AND THAT RUBIK'S CUBE
WITH ONE SIDE FINISHED.

02:28.549 --> 02:31.685
HEY, IT'S A MARATHON,
NOT A SPRINT, ALL RIGHT?

02:31.685 --> 02:34.522
GEORGE, I'M GONNA BE
BUSY SHOPPING.

02:34.522 --> 02:35.989
CAN YOU
STOP BY THE POST OFFICE

02:35.989 --> 02:37.825
AND CHANGE YOUR MOM'S
HOME ADDRESS TO HERE?

02:37.825 --> 02:40.361
WHY DON'T I JUST
POINT TO THE WANTED POSTER

02:40.361 --> 02:42.930
AND TELL 'EM THAT NUMBER EIGHT
SHAVED HER BEARD,

02:42.930 --> 02:44.298
AND SHE'S LIVING WITH US?

02:44.298 --> 02:46.334
CAN'T THEY JUST
HOLD HER MAIL, ANGIE?

02:46.334 --> 02:48.469
SHE'S NOT GONNA BE
WITH US THAT LONG.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.338
YOUR MOM LOST EVERYTHING.

02:50.338 --> 02:51.639
SHE NEEDS US,

02:51.639 --> 02:53.641
AND WE'RE
GONNA BE THERE FOR HER.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.676
I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE HARD,

02:55.676 --> 02:57.678
BUT WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FACE THE FACT

02:57.678 --> 03:03.116
THAT SHE MAY BE LIVING HERE
FOR A LONG, LONG...

03:03.116 --> 03:04.752
TIME.

03:04.752 --> 03:07.755
YEAH, HOW ARE YOU
GONNA FACE THAT?

03:07.755 --> 03:09.723
BY THROWING MYSELF
IN MY WORK

03:09.723 --> 03:11.959
AND TURNING MY BACK
ON MY FAMILY.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.894
THAT'S MINE!

03:15.696 --> 03:18.766
MAN, BENNY'S
GOT NO RETIREMENT.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.901
SHE'S NOT GETTIN'
ANY YOUNGER.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.471
YOU COULD BE LIVING
WITH YOUR MOM FOREVER.

03:23.471 --> 03:26.006
OOH, THAT'S ROUGH.

03:26.006 --> 03:29.810
HEY, FOOL,
YOU STILL LIVE WITH YOUR MOM.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.780
YEAH, BUT I DON'T
HAVE TO WORK WITH HER.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.715
YOU GOT NO ESCAPE NOW,
GEORGE.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.384
YOU'RE GONNA BE
WITH BENNY ALL DAY.

03:36.384 --> 03:41.389
BREAKFAST, CARPOOL,
WORK, CARPOOL, DINNER.

03:41.389 --> 03:43.924
BREAKFAST, CARPOOL, WORK,
CARPOOL, DINNER.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.260
BREAKFAST, CARPOOL,
WORK, CARPOOL, DINNER.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.696
BREAKFAST, CARPOOL, WORK--
I GOT IT.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.998
ALL RIGHT, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I ONLY GOT TO WEDNESDAY,

03:50.998 --> 03:53.033
'CAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT THURSDAY'S GONNA BE LIKE?

03:53.033 --> 03:56.270
BREAKFAST, CARPOOL, WORK,
CARPOOL, DINNER.
ENOUGH!

03:56.270 --> 03:58.839
THIS IS NEVER
GONNA WORK OUT.

03:58.839 --> 04:02.042
I LIVED WITH MY MOM
FOR 18 YEARS, AND IT WAS HELL.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.311
(snaps fingers)

04:03.311 --> 04:04.745
I'VE GOTTA
GET HER AN APARTMENT.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.880
OH, YEAH? WHAT ABOUT
WHAT ANGIE JUST SAID, HUH?

04:06.880 --> 04:08.982
(childish voice) "WHAT ABOUT
WHAT ANGIE JUST SAID?"

04:10.618 --> 04:13.253
SO HOW SOON ARE YOU GONNA
GET BENNY OUT OF HERE?

04:13.253 --> 04:14.755
I DON'T KNOW.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.757
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH
SOMETHING PRETTY TRAUMATIC.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.460
IT'S GONNA TAKE HER AWHILE
TO GET BACK ON HER FEET.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.994
MAYBE A MONTH.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.630
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

04:22.630 --> 04:24.932
ANGIE'S NIGHTSHIRT FITS ME.

04:27.435 --> 04:32.105
"WANT FRIES"...

04:32.105 --> 04:34.875
"WITH THIS SHAKE?"

04:38.812 --> 04:42.983
THAT'S NOT A SHAKE, VATO.
THAT'S AN UNHAPPY MEAL.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.919
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

04:49.590 --> 04:51.459
* ALL MY FRIENDS

04:51.459 --> 04:55.162
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

04:55.162 --> 04:56.630
* YEAH

04:56.630 --> 04:58.198
* THE LOW RIDER

04:58.198 --> 05:01.802
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

05:01.802 --> 05:03.437
* YEAH

05:12.646 --> 05:15.383
CARMEN, THIS CAME FOR YOU
FROM JASON.

05:15.383 --> 05:16.684
HE'S SO SWEET.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.919
I WONDER WHAT GIFT
HE GOT ME.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.825
THIS IS THE PICTURE OF ME
I SENT HIM.

05:24.825 --> 05:29.029
OH, HONEY,
I'M SO SORRY.

05:29.029 --> 05:32.600
I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T WANT
TO ACCEPT THAT JASON'S MOVED ON,

05:32.600 --> 05:35.703
BUT THIS SHOULD
MAKE IT PRETTY CLEAR.

05:35.703 --> 05:36.904
WHY?

05:36.904 --> 05:40.073
CARMEN, HE'S MOVED
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

05:40.073 --> 05:43.343
HE WON'T RETURN YOUR CALLS,
AND NOW HE SENT YOUR GIFT BACK.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.712
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?

05:44.712 --> 05:47.881
MOM, IT'S SO OBVIOUS
WHAT'S GOING ON.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.049
IT IS TO US,

05:49.049 --> 05:52.986
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS GOING ON?

05:52.986 --> 05:54.888
JASON'S 3,000 MILES AWAY.

05:54.888 --> 05:58.158
A PICTURE OF ME WOULD JUST
MAKE HIM MISS ME MORE.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.627
SWEETHEART,

05:59.627 --> 06:01.629
IF I END UP
SLAPPING YOU IN YOUR FACE

06:01.629 --> 06:04.898
IT'S TO HELP YOU,
NOT TO HURT YOU.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.435
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU'RE SO WORRIED ABOUT US.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.336
WHEN JASON SAID
HE'D LOVE ME FOREVER,

06:09.336 --> 06:10.738
HE MEANT FOREVER.

06:10.738 --> 06:14.808
WHEN HE SAID THAT,
WAS YOUR SHIRT ON OR OFF?

06:15.943 --> 06:17.177
UPSTAIRS.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.079
IT MATTERS.
GET!

06:20.313 --> 06:21.682
HEY,
HAVE YOU SEEN MY MOM?

06:21.682 --> 06:24.718
SHE'S SMOKING
IN THE YARD.

06:24.718 --> 06:28.689
SO, MOM,
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.291
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN A WEEK
SINCE YOUR HOUSE BURNED DOWN.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.026
HOW ARE YOU REALLY FEELING?

06:33.026 --> 06:34.662
WELL, HONESTLY--

06:34.662 --> 06:36.864
I KNEW YOU'D BOUNCE BACK.
LET'S LOOK FOR APARTMENTS.

06:36.864 --> 06:37.865
WHAT?

06:37.865 --> 06:39.900
ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET RID OF ME?

06:39.900 --> 06:42.903
IS THE MOTHER BIRD TRYING
TO GET RID OF THE BABY BIRD

06:42.903 --> 06:44.905
WHEN SHE KICKS IT
OUT OF THE NEST? NO.

06:44.905 --> 06:48.842
SHE WANTS IT TO GET STRONGER
OR DIE TRYING.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.844
DID ANGIE
PUT YOU UP TO THIS?

06:50.844 --> 06:53.514
SHE WAS WAY TOO NICE TO ME
THIS LAST WEEK.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.516
I'M NOT GONNA
SELL OUT MY WIFE,

06:55.516 --> 06:58.886
BUT, YES,
SHE'S BEHIND ALL THIS.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.420
I KNEW IT.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.722
COME ON, MOM, REALLY,

07:01.722 --> 07:03.090
HOW LONG DID YOU THINK
YOU WERE GONNA STAY?

07:03.090 --> 07:05.793
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW, MAYBE ENOUGH TIME

07:05.793 --> 07:07.895
TO SAVE SOME MONEY,
GET BACK ON MY FEET.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.730
WELL,
TODAY'S YOUR LUCKY DAY,

07:09.730 --> 07:13.467
BECAUSE I GOT YOUR PAYCHECK
AND I GOT YOU AN ADVANCE.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.768
ALL RIGHT!

07:14.768 --> 07:16.003
(laughs)

07:16.003 --> 07:18.305
OH,
THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.207
YEAH, COME ON, GET YOUR STUFF.
LET'S LOOK AT APARTMENTS.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.742
SURE, YEAH. WHY NOT?

07:21.742 --> 07:24.478
AND I FOUND A PLACE
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA LOVE.

07:24.478 --> 07:27.380
IT'S BY A LIQUOR STORE
AND A MEN'S SHELTER.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.817
HUH? BOOZE AND MEN
ON THEIR WAY DOWN.

07:29.817 --> 07:33.086
TELL ME THAT DOESN'T
FEEL LIKE HOME, MOM.

07:36.389 --> 07:39.059
HEY, VIC, YOU LIKE YOUR
APARTMENT BUILDING, RIGHT?

07:39.059 --> 07:40.160
OH, IT'S FANTASTIC.

07:40.160 --> 07:43.063
THERE IS A GYM, A POOL,
AND ALL THE WOMEN

07:43.063 --> 07:47.901
HAVE ROCK-HARD BODIES
THAT WERE BUILT FOR THONGS.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.237
THAT'S GREAT, 'CAUSE I'M
TAKING MY MOM OVER THERE

07:50.237 --> 07:51.905
TO LOOK AT A STUDIO TODAY.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.608
NO, NO, YOU CANNOT.
THERE ARE NO VACANCIES.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.043
BUT I DROPPED BY THIS MORNING.
I SAW A SIGN.

07:56.043 --> 07:58.278
BUT DRIVE BY THIS AFTERNOON.
IT WON'T BE THERE.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.213
I HAVE TO GO.

08:06.286 --> 08:09.056
COME ON, MOM, WE SAW SOME
GREAT APARTMENTS TODAY.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.725
GEORGE, NONE OF 'EM
FELT LIKE HOME.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.261
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T ADDED
YOUR SPECIAL TOUCHES YET.

08:14.261 --> 08:17.698
YOU NEED TO SPILL SOME BEER
ON THE CARPET...

08:17.698 --> 08:19.900
PUT SOME CLAW MARKS
ON THE HEADBOARD.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.469
MAYBE WE CAN FIND
A CHUBBY MEXICAN BOY

08:22.469 --> 08:25.673
YOU CAN IGNORE
FOR 18 YEARS.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.208
OH, SORRY, PRINCESS,
I DIDN'T FIND ANY APARTMENTS.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.177
YOU'RE STILL STUCK WITH ME.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.714
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
HIDE IT ANYMORE.

08:33.714 --> 08:37.017
GEORGE TOLD ME THAT YOU WANT ME
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.286
YEAH, YOU'RE
ALL ABOUT FAMILY.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.060
ALL RIGHT, HEAR ME OUT.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.997
ALL RIGHT, YOU GO.
I NEED TIME TO THINK.

08:49.997 --> 08:53.000
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
MAKE HER FEEL WELCOME HERE,

08:53.000 --> 08:55.569
AND YOU COMPLETELY
UNDERMINE ME.
OKAY, I GOT SOMETHING.

08:55.569 --> 08:56.737
OY.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.239
THIS IS MY FAMILY.
LET ME HANDLE IT.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.642
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,
WE ALL BECAME ONE FAMILY.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.143
OH!

09:03.143 --> 09:07.180
OKAY, GO AGAIN.
I NEED MORE TIME TO THINK.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.850
LOOK, WHEN MY MOM AND DAD
CAME HERE FROM CUBA,

09:09.850 --> 09:12.419
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
BUT THE CLOTHES ON THEIR BACKS.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.521
AND MY UNCLE,
WHO HATED MY FATHER,

09:14.521 --> 09:16.156
TOOK THEM IN FOR TWO YEARS

09:16.156 --> 09:19.827
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES
DO FOR EACH OTHER.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.762
NO, THAT'S WHAT
CUBAN FAMILIES DO.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.463
WE'RE MEXICAN.

09:23.463 --> 09:25.633
IF WE DON'T LIKE A RELATIVE,
WE DON'T DEAL WITH 'EM.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.234
REMEMBER MY COUSIN TOOTIE?

09:27.234 --> 09:30.203
HE'D SAY, "I HAVEN'T TALKED
TO MY DAD IN 17 YEARS."

09:30.203 --> 09:35.508
I'D SAY, "WHERE IS HE?"
"HE'S IN THE LIVING ROOM."

09:35.508 --> 09:37.044
YOU KNOW,

09:37.044 --> 09:40.781
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING
DEEPER GOING ON WITH YOU.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.783
NO, THERE'S NOT.
THERE NEVER IS.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.919
IN 19 YEARS, HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN ANY DEEPNESS?

09:48.288 --> 09:52.860
MAYBE IT'S TOUGH SEEING YOUR MOM
IN SUCH A VULNERABLE PLACE

09:52.860 --> 09:55.528
BECAUSE THE PARENT
IS BECOMING THE CHILD,

09:55.528 --> 09:58.398
AND NOW YOU HAVE
TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.300
YOU KNOW, YOUR READING
IS HURTING OUR MARRIAGE.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.435
WHY DON'T YOU STICK
TO THE DIRTY NOVELS?

10:02.435 --> 10:03.771
LOOK...

10:03.771 --> 10:06.640
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO DEAL WITH THIS.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.842
I'M PLANNING A BIG WEDDING
IN MALIBU.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.310
YOU NEED TO GET OVER
YOUR OWN ISSUES

10:10.310 --> 10:12.079
AND MAKE YOUR MOM
FEEL WELCOME,

10:12.079 --> 10:14.147
BECAUSE SHE'S STAYING HERE
AS LONG AS SHE WANTS TO.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.183
ANGIE--
END OF DISCUSSION.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.785
OH...

10:17.785 --> 10:20.220
I TOLD YOU,
NOT IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS!

10:23.323 --> 10:28.095
HEY, YOU BETTER CALL 9-1-1
'CAUSE YOU JUST GOT BURNED.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.296
WHOO!

10:29.296 --> 10:32.700
YEAH, WELL, AT LEAST
I GOT A WOMAN TO YELL AT ME.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.001
BACK BURN!

10:34.001 --> 10:35.568
TRUCE?
YEAH.

10:35.568 --> 10:36.569
DONE.

10:36.569 --> 10:37.905
ALL RIGHT.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.773
SO YOU READY TO
HIT THE DRIVING RANGE?

10:39.773 --> 10:41.374
YEAH, LET ME GET MY CLUBS.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.977
I JUST NEED TO GIVE YOUR MAMA
A MESSAGE FROM BIG JIMMY.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.913
BIG JIMMY BRISCOE
THE BOOKIE?

10:45.913 --> 10:47.815
YEAH. I SAW HIM
AT THIRSTY'S LAST NIGHT.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.883
HE SAID YOUR MOM
CAN'T SIGN OVER HER PAYCHECK.

10:49.883 --> 10:53.553
HE'LL ONLY TAKE CASH.

10:53.553 --> 10:56.056
(sports event playing on TV)

10:58.892 --> 11:00.828
HOW'S THE GAME, MOM?

11:00.828 --> 11:02.696
OH, YOU KNOW,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

11:02.696 --> 11:05.465
YOU ROOTIN' FOR ANYONE
IN PARTICULAR?

11:05.465 --> 11:08.902
UH-UH.
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.604
YES! INTERCEPTED!
THANK YOU, LORD!

11:11.604 --> 11:14.674
HEY, HEY, HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:14.674 --> 11:16.643
CHECK IT OUT.
IT'S A POKER TOURNAMENT.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.578
MAN, THAT GUY
JUST BET ALL HIS CHIPS.

11:18.578 --> 11:21.114
YOU'D HAVE TO BE STUPID
TO TAKE THAT KIND OF RISK.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.116
UNLESS HE'S LEECHING OFF
HIS SON,

11:23.116 --> 11:25.452
HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY REAL EXPENSES.

11:25.452 --> 11:29.356
SO I MADE A BET.
BIG DEAL.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.959
HOW COULD YOU GAMBLE, MOM?

11:31.959 --> 11:34.728
I GOT YOU YOUR PAYCHECK.
I EVEN GOT YOU AN ADVANCE.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.429
I WENT OUT ON A LIMB FOR YOU.

11:36.429 --> 11:39.800
IT'S MY MONEY, AND I'LL DO
WHAT I WANT WITH IT.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.534
NOT WHEN YOU'RE LIVING
IN MY HOUSE RENT-FREE.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.371
YOU'RE EATING OUR FOOD.
ANGIE'S BUYING YOU CLOTHES.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.273
YOU'RE JUST MOOCHING OFF US.

11:46.273 --> 11:49.176
EXCUSE ME
FOR HAVING FUN, OKAY?

11:49.176 --> 11:51.611
BUT MY FREAKIN' HOUSE
JUST BURNED DOWN!

11:51.611 --> 11:53.480
SO MAYBE I DID
BLOW A LITTLE MONEY,

11:53.480 --> 11:56.850
BUT AS SOON AS THIS KID
MAKES THIS FIELD GOAL,

11:56.850 --> 11:59.252
I AM GONNA
WIN IT ALL BACK.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.055
CRAP!

12:02.055 --> 12:06.726
WHO MISSES
A 20-YARD FIELD GOAL, HUH?!

12:06.726 --> 12:08.829
YOU KNOW WHAT, MOM?

12:08.829 --> 12:10.330
I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.499
WHAT?
LOOK, I'M SORRY
YOU LOST YOUR HOUSE.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.903
BUT I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.238
I'LL GIVE YOU MONEY
FOR AN APARTMENT.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.541
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
YOU'RE KICKING ME OUT?

12:21.541 --> 12:24.177
THIS CHECK WILL COVER
THE FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S RENT.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.446
AND I HEAR BIG JIMMY BRISCOE'S
LOOKING FOR YOU,

12:26.446 --> 12:29.983
SO I'LL THROW AN EXTRA $100 IN
FOR A HAT AND A MUSTACHE.

12:32.552 --> 12:35.722
MAYBE JUST A HAT.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.057
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:37.057 --> 12:38.959
I DON'T NEED
YOUR STINKIN' MONEY.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.829
THERE IS A FLAG ON THE PLAY,
AND THERE IS NO WAY

12:41.829 --> 12:45.833
THAT THIS LOSER IS GONNA MISS
ANOTHER 20-YARD FIELD GOAL!

12:45.833 --> 12:47.801
CRAP!

12:49.837 --> 12:51.304
WAIT, THERE'S ANOTHER FLAG!

12:51.304 --> 12:52.405
OOH, REALLY?

12:52.405 --> 12:55.008
NO, I'M JUST PLAYING
WITH YOUR SICKNESS.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.217
HEY.
OKAY, CARMEN
IS STILL IN DENIAL.

13:04.217 --> 13:07.287
JASON SENT HER GIFT BACK
WITH A LETTER DUMPING HER,

13:07.287 --> 13:09.556
AND SHE REFUSES
TO ACCEPT IT.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.391
ANGIE, THIS IS A GOOD THING.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.862
EVEN IF IT'S BASED ON
A TOTAL LIE, CARMEN'S HAPPY.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.396
IT'S LIKE THE WEEK

13:16.396 --> 13:19.766
YOU THOUGHT WE WERE GOING
TO SPAIN ON OUR HONEYMOON.

13:19.766 --> 13:22.936
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

13:22.936 --> 13:25.272
MOM'S WEDDING DRESS
ALMOST FITS ME.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.945
IT MUST BE 12:00
BECAUSE "CUCKOO, CUCKOO."

13:31.945 --> 13:34.882
I'M GONNA SEE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE OUTSIDE,

13:34.882 --> 13:37.784
'CAUSE I'M GONNA HAVE
AN OUTDOOR WEDDING.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.386
(whistles)

13:39.386 --> 13:41.388
WOULD YOU PLEASE
TALK TO YOUR DAUGHTER?

13:41.388 --> 13:44.958
I CAN'T GET THROUGH TO HER.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I CAN?

13:44.958 --> 13:46.459
BECAUSE YOU'RE BLUNT,

13:46.459 --> 13:48.395
AND YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.965
IT'S THE ONLY GOOD THING
I EVER GOT FROM MY MOM.

13:58.571 --> 14:01.774
BE HONEST. DO YOU LIKE
THIS DRESS ON ME?

14:01.774 --> 14:03.610
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL, HONEY.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.579
BUT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT
THIS LETTER FROM JASON.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.416
OH, IT'S OKAY. HE JUST HAS
COLD FEET ABOUT THE MARRIAGE.

14:09.416 --> 14:11.251
THE MAGAZINES SAY
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.420
YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.923
LOOK, I'M A GUY, SO I KNOW
WHAT HE'S TRYING TO SAY.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.325
LET ME TRANSLATE IT FOR YOU.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.933
"CARMEN, THE LAST THING
I WANT TO DO IS HURT YOU."

14:25.933 --> 14:28.735
THAT MEANS
"HERE COMES THE HURT."

14:28.735 --> 14:32.205
"WE'VE BOTH BEEN THROUGH
A LOT OF GROWTH AND CHANGE."

14:32.205 --> 14:35.108
HE'S TIRED OF YOU,
AND HE'S MOVING ON.

14:35.108 --> 14:39.012
"BUT WE NEED TO
PURSUE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES..."

14:39.012 --> 14:42.983
HE'S MET SOMEONE ELSE.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.885
"AND KEEP OUR MINDS OPEN."

14:47.820 --> 14:50.157
SHE'S BLACK OR ASIAN.

14:53.393 --> 14:58.265
"I DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE
TO SAY THIS, BUT IT'S OVER."

14:58.265 --> 15:01.101
IT'S OVER.

15:03.536 --> 15:07.174
(crying)
YEAH, BUT I STILL LOVE HIM.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.242
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.244
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S REALLY OVER.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.180
WHAT AM I GONNA DO
WITHOUT HIM?

15:13.180 --> 15:15.448
CARMEN, YOU CAN DO BETTER
THAN SOME BASEBALL PLAYER

15:15.448 --> 15:17.450
WHO'S ALWAYS GONNA BE
ON THE ROAD.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.919
YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF OTHER GUYS
AFTER YOU. YOU'RE A CATCH.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.622
I KNOW.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

15:24.924 --> 15:27.427
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE HE'S A LITTLE...

15:27.427 --> 15:29.396
(whistles)

15:36.069 --> 15:37.971
I LOVE YOU, DADDY.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.974
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.350
WHAT THE HELL?

15:52.986 --> 15:56.423
(hair dryer whirring)

16:01.228 --> 16:03.230
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

16:03.230 --> 16:05.465
I WAS DRYING MY HAIR
IN MY LIVING ROOM.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.868
AND NOW I'M STIRRING MY BEANS
IN MY KITCHEN.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.870
MOM, YOU CAN'T LIVE
IN YOUR CAR.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.672
WELL, YOU KICKED ME OUT.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.607
I GAVE YOU A CHECK
FOR AN APARTMENT,

16:14.607 --> 16:17.510
OR DID YOU
GAMBLE THAT AWAY, TOO?
NO, I DID NOT.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.546
I CASHED IT AND LOCKED IT
IN MY GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.348
NOW IF YOU WILL
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE,

16:21.348 --> 16:22.849
I'M GOING TO START MY HOUSE

16:22.849 --> 16:26.186
SO I CAN DRY MY UNDERWEAR
ON THE ENGINE BLOCK!

16:26.186 --> 16:28.121
OKAY, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.190
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO
MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.292
YOU SHOULD FEEL GUILTY, GEORGE!
YOU OWE ME!

16:32.292 --> 16:35.128
I BROUGHT YOU INTO THIS WORLD.
AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.464
YEAH, I REMEMBER YOU
LEANING OVER MY CRIB SAYING,

16:37.464 --> 16:40.733
"GOOD NIGHT,
MY LITTLE DRUNKEN MISTAKE."

16:40.733 --> 16:43.136
YOU REMEMBER THAT
FROM WHEN YOU WERE A BABY?

16:43.136 --> 16:45.405
NO, YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME
A REAL BED TILL I WAS 7!

16:45.405 --> 16:47.340
I WAS SO CRAMPED IN THERE.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.809
EVERY MORNING,
I WOKE UP WITH A DEAD LEG.

16:49.809 --> 16:53.213
I COULD BARELY CATCH THE BUS.
I WAS LIKE, "HEY, WAIT UP!"

16:53.213 --> 16:55.115
AFTER YOU LEFT MY HOUSE,

16:55.115 --> 16:56.649
YOU WERE ALIVE
AND HEALTHY, OKAY?

16:56.649 --> 17:00.053
I DID MY JOB. AND WHAT KIND
OF THANKS DO I GET, HUH?

17:00.053 --> 17:01.454
I GET KICKED TO THE CURB!

17:01.454 --> 17:03.056
HEY, LIVING OUT HERE
IS YOUR CHOICE.

17:03.056 --> 17:06.226
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GUILT ME INTO
LETTING YOU BACK IN THE HOUSE.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.161
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

17:08.161 --> 17:12.199
WELL, I COULD NEVER
MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY.

17:15.168 --> 17:17.170
GO AHEAD, PUT IT UP.

17:17.170 --> 17:20.273
I DON'T CARE
WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF ME.

17:20.273 --> 17:21.974
(car honks)

17:21.974 --> 17:24.444
THANK YOU! THAT'S HIM!

17:31.318 --> 17:33.720
WAKE YOUR MOM UP!
HER CAR IS ON FIRE!
WHAT?

17:33.720 --> 17:36.456
HER CAR IS OUTSIDE,
AND IT'S ON FIRE!
GOD!

17:36.456 --> 17:39.426
WHERE IS SHE?
IN THE LIVING ROOM?

17:39.426 --> 17:41.694
NO, SHE'S LIVING IN HER CAR.
WHAT?!

17:41.694 --> 17:43.563
I KICKED HER OUT
BECAUSE SHE WAS GAMBLING.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.898
THAT'S WHAT
MEXICAN FAMILIES DO.
GEORGE!

17:45.898 --> 17:48.701
DON'T YELL AT ME, ANGIE!
I GOTTA PUT OUT MY MOTHER!

17:53.640 --> 17:55.475
THANKS.

17:55.475 --> 18:00.012
HOLY CRAP!
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE?

18:00.012 --> 18:02.149
WHERE WERE YOU?

18:02.149 --> 18:04.584
I WAS SIPHONING GAS OUT
OF THE CHANGS' MINIVAN.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.987
I HEARD THE SIRENS,
SO I HID IN THE BUSHES.

18:07.987 --> 18:11.691
DID YOU LEAVE ANOTHER CIGARETTE
BURNING IN YOUR CAR?

18:11.691 --> 18:13.993
NO. I'M NOT AN IDIOT!

18:13.993 --> 18:18.365
I PUT THE CIGARETTE ON THE EDGE
OF THE ASHTRAY, AND THEN I LEFT.

18:18.365 --> 18:21.067
DID YOU SLAM THE DOOR?

18:21.067 --> 18:23.570
OH, DAMN IT.

18:23.570 --> 18:27.207
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO LOSE MY RESPECT?

18:27.207 --> 18:29.609
BECAUSE NOW
YOU'VE LOST EVERYTHING.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.811
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'VE BEEN SERVED.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.650
TELL ME THE MONEY
THAT I GAVE YOU

18:37.650 --> 18:40.287
WASN'T IN
THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

18:40.287 --> 18:43.055
WHO CARES ABOUT YOUR MONEY?

18:43.055 --> 18:45.958
THE LAST THING I OWNED
IN THIS WORLD JUST BURNED UP

18:45.958 --> 18:48.395
BECAUSE YOU WOULDN'T LET ME
LIVE IN YOUR HOUSE!

18:48.395 --> 18:50.563
OH, DON'T BLAME THIS ON ME!

18:50.563 --> 18:53.132
I GAVE YOU MONEY
FOR AN APARTMENT!
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
IN AN APARTMENT!

18:53.132 --> 18:54.701
WHAT AM I GONNA DO THERE?

18:54.701 --> 18:57.136
SIT ON MY BUTT
AND STARE AT A TV ALL DAY?

18:57.136 --> 18:59.472
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO HERE!
NO.

18:59.472 --> 19:02.575
IT'S DIFFERENT.
THERE ARE PEOPLE AROUND.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.577
WELL, I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
LIVING ALONE.

19:04.577 --> 19:08.215
WHY ELSE WOULD YOU
LET YOUR HOUSE SMELL LIKE THAT?

19:08.215 --> 19:10.850
YOU KNOW, YOU LIVE ALONE,
YOU DIE ALONE.

19:10.850 --> 19:14.421
AND THAT JUST DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
THE PARTY IT USED TO.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.589
YOU'RE ACTUALLY SCARED.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.325
NO, I AM NOT.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.759
YEAH, YOU ARE.

19:19.759 --> 19:23.330
YOU GOT THE SAME EXPRESSION
ON YOUR FACE AS YOU DO

19:23.330 --> 19:25.532
WHEN YOU GET AN ENVELOPE
FROM THE FREE CLINIC.

19:25.532 --> 19:29.236
FINE, JUST FORGET
I SAID ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

19:29.236 --> 19:31.238
I'M JUST GONNA
GRAB THE REST OF MY STUFF

19:31.238 --> 19:33.673
AND GET OUT OF HERE!

19:33.673 --> 19:36.142
OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA
GET OUT OF HERE.

19:36.142 --> 19:39.379
WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST SAY YOU
WANTED TO BE AROUND YOUR FAMILY?

19:39.379 --> 19:43.550
MAYBE I WANTED TO AVOID
A CONVERSATION LIKE THIS!

19:45.585 --> 19:48.321
FAMILY IS JUST SUPPOSED TO
KNOW THINGS, GEORGE.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.857
I MEAN, WHEN YOU WERE CRYING
AS A KID,

19:50.857 --> 19:53.125
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
WHY YOU WERE CRYING.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.194
I JUST--I HELD YOU.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.431
TOO MUCH?

19:58.431 --> 20:00.767
YEAH, I REMEMBER YOU
HOLDING ME, MOM.

20:00.767 --> 20:04.337
YOU WERE USING ME AS A SHIELD
TO SPRAY A BEEHIVE.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.439
I WAS ALLERGIC.
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T.

20:06.439 --> 20:07.974
OKAY, I WAS WRONG.
I'M SORRY.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.977
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
NICE TO HEAR IN THE HOSPITAL

20:10.977 --> 20:13.813
WHEN I WAS BREATHING THROUGH
A COFFEE STRAW.
ALL RIGHT.

20:13.813 --> 20:17.250
YOU THINK I'M A LOUSY MOTHER,
AND I DESERVE THIS. FINE.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.851
I'M GONE!

20:18.851 --> 20:20.820
GO.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.889
I'M GOING!

20:22.889 --> 20:25.458
BYE.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.431
DAMN! OOH!

20:33.232 --> 20:35.468
OH, DAMN. TRICK KNEE.

20:37.337 --> 20:41.541
HEY, THERE, MR. SNAIL.

20:41.541 --> 20:45.612
AT LEAST YOU'VE GOT YOUR HOUSE
ON YOUR BACK.

20:47.447 --> 20:50.483
ANY ROOM IN THERE FOR ME?

20:51.884 --> 20:54.721
KNOCK IT OFF, MOM.
OKAY, YOU CAN LIVE WITH US.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.889
WELL, IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT, GEORGE.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.158
YOU KNOW, I'M TIRED OF
FIGHTING WITH YOU.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.528
(squish)

21:01.528 --> 21:04.697
STUPID SNAIL.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.566
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.
I'M GOING TO BED.

21:06.566 --> 21:09.068
I'M GONNA CRASH
ON THE COUCH.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.037
YOU KNOW...

21:11.037 --> 21:13.640
WHEN I CAME OUT HERE TONIGHT,
IT WAS THE SECOND TIME IN A WEEK

21:13.640 --> 21:16.409
THAT I THOUGHT
YOU WERE BURNED ALIVE.

21:16.409 --> 21:19.946
I'M STARTING TO BE
OKAY WITH IT.
