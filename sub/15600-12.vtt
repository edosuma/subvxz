LET'S TAKE HIM TO OZ'S.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.611

15:45.694 --> 15:46.737
THERE'S A HORRIBLE MONSTER--

15:46.820 --> 15:50.115
- AHA!
I GOT YOU, MONSTER.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.242
OH, IT'S JUST YOU GUYS.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.577
- WHOA, ARE YOU TRYING
TO CAPTURE THAT THING

15:53.661 --> 15:56.038
THAT DESTROYED THE TOWN?

15:56.121 --> 15:58.207
- THAT, I AM.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.875
- WHAT KIND OF MONSTER IS THIS?

15:59.958 --> 16:00.959
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

16:01.043 --> 16:02.294
- OH, YES, I'VE SEEN IT,

16:02.378 --> 16:05.464
AND IT WILL HAUNT ME

16:05.547 --> 16:06.715
IT'S A HIDEOUS THING

16:06.799 --> 16:10.594
ARMED WITH THE RAZOR-SHARP
QUILLS OF A PORCUPINE.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.430
- OOH, SOUNDS HORRIBLE.

16:13.514 --> 16:14.723
SHH. SHH.
OW!

16:14.807 --> 16:18.936
- AND IT BITES WITH THE VENOMOUS
FANGS OF A RATTLESNAKE.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.896
- UGH!
SIMPLY AWFUL.

16:20.979 --> 16:23.732

UH-UH-UH, NOT NOW.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.192
DADDY'S LISTENING.

16:25.275 --> 16:28.570
- AND IT BEFOULED THE AIR
WITH THE SUPER-STINKY STENCH

16:28.654 --> 16:30.531
OF A SERIOUSLY SMELLY SKUNK.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.574
- OH, DISGUSTING!

16:32.658 --> 16:33.867
- [sniffs]

16:33.951 --> 16:37.621
- I THINK
SCOOTER NEEDS CHANGING.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.498
SO WHAT'S THIS MONSTER CALLED,
ANYWAY?

16:39.581 --> 16:43.127
- THE WAMPANOCO PEOPLES OF
THE POCONOS HAVE A NAME FOR IT.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.920
[clears throat]

16:45.003 --> 16:50.092
[yelling]

16:50.175 --> 16:53.262
BUT THAT DOESN'T EVEN CAPTURE
THE TRUE TERROR OF THE BEAST.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.972
AND IT HURTS THE THROAT.

16:55.055 --> 16:59.560
THAT'S WHY I CALL IT
RATTLESKUNKUPINE.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.353
- UGH, IT'S HIDEOUS.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.521
THE ONLY APPEALING THING
ABOUT IT

17:02.604 --> 17:05.566
IS THE WAY IT SCOOTS ALONG,
JUST LIKE YOU,

17:05.648 --> 17:06.023
LITTLE--

17:09.319 --> 17:11.739
UH-OH.

17:11.821 --> 17:14.657
- YES, RATTLESKUNKUPINE,

17:14.742 --> 17:16.785
LONG HAVE YOU ELUDED ME.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.163
CUT TO FLASHBACK.

17:19.246 --> 17:24.376
I FIRST TRACKED THE CREATURE
IN THE AFRICAN DESERT.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.337
I WAS HOT ON ITS TRAIL,
BUT I GOT SLOPPY,

17:27.421 --> 17:31.216
AND WHEN I WASN'T LOOKING...

17:31.300 --> 17:32.926
IT TOOK MY LEG!

17:33.010 --> 17:35.262
MY CHICKEN LEG.

17:35.345 --> 17:36.805
- YEE-HAW!

17:36.889 --> 17:41.852
- NOOOOOOOO!

17:41.935 --> 17:43.312
YEARS LATER, I GOT A TIP

17:43.395 --> 17:46.440
THAT IT WAS SPOTTED
IN THE AMAZON JUNGLE.

17:46.523 --> 17:49.818
I SET A TRAP
AND WAITED FOR WEEKS,

17:49.902 --> 17:53.155
SURVIVING ON NOTHING BUT MEAT,
VEGETABLES, GRAIN,

17:53.238 --> 17:54.698
AND DAIRY PRODUCTS.

17:54.782 --> 17:58.035
BUT THE CREATURE WAS CUNNING,
AND WHEN I WASN'T PREPARED,

17:58.118 --> 18:01.914
IT SNUCK UP BEHIND ME,
AND IT TOOK MY EAR!

18:01.997 --> 18:04.166
MY EAR OF CORN.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.543
- YEE-HAW!

18:06.627 --> 18:10.130
- NOOOOOOOO!

18:10.214 --> 18:11.924
THE LAST TIME I CROSSED PATHS
WITH THE BEAST

18:12.007 --> 18:15.093
WAS IN THE ARCTIC TUNDRA.

18:15.177 --> 18:19.097
THERE, WE FOUGHT FOR HOURS
UNTIL THE SNOW WAS STAINED RED.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.933
OW!
AH!

18:21.016 --> 18:22.643
BUT, ALAS, AFTER IT BROKE
MY RIBS--

18:22.726 --> 18:26.355
MY BARBECUE RIBS--

18:26.438 --> 18:27.481
- YEE-HAW!

18:27.564 --> 18:28.732
- IT VANISHED.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.193
- NOOOOOOOO!

18:31.276 --> 18:32.861
[gobbling]

18:32.945 --> 18:35.280
AND WHEN I FINALLY
TRACK IT DOWN,

18:35.364 --> 18:38.200
I WILL TAKE FROM IT
ALL THAT WAS TAKEN FROM ME.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.743
SO WHAT'S IN THE CARRIAGE?

18:39.827 --> 18:40.744
[both gulp]

18:40.828 --> 18:44.957
- OH, UM, JUST OUR...
GROCERIES?

18:45.040 --> 18:47.668
- SWEET! ALL THOSE FLASHBACKS
MADE ME STARVING.

18:47.751 --> 18:50.462
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.006
AH! OOH!

18:53.090 --> 18:56.260
AH, SOMETHING PRICKED MY FINGER.

18:56.343 --> 18:57.719
[moaning]

18:57.803 --> 18:59.263
WAIT A MINUTE.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.058
THE RATTLESKUNKUPINE...

19:03.141 --> 19:04.560
TOOK ALL YOUR GROCERIES.

19:04.643 --> 19:08.730
NOOOOOOOO...

19:08.814 --> 19:10.107
- WHERE'S SCOOTER?

19:10.190 --> 19:12.568
- I DON'T KNOW.
WE HAVE TO FIND HIM.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.195
- ...OOOOOOOOO!

19:16.572 --> 19:18.365
OOH, THAT WAS A LONG ONE.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.367
- WELL, OZ, WE SHOULD BE GOING.

19:20.450 --> 19:23.579
DON'T WANT TO KEEP YOU FROM
YOUR ALL-CONSUMING OBSESSION.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.330
- WAIT RIGHT THERE.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.165
YOU TWO AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE,

19:27.249 --> 19:28.375
'CAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO HELP ME

19:28.458 --> 19:30.919
FINALLY CAPTURE
THE RATTLESKUNKUPINE.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.504
[both laugh nervously]

19:36.174 --> 19:36.884
- HERE, SCOOTER!

19:36.967 --> 19:39.678
- SCOOTER, WHERE ARE YOU?

19:39.761 --> 19:41.054
[rattling noise]

19:41.138 --> 19:42.890
- [gasps]
YOU HEAR THAT, CHUM CHUM?

19:42.973 --> 19:44.766
- IT SOUNDS LIKE SCOOTER.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.269
- GUYS, SERIOUSLY,
STOP HISSING.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.187
I'M TRYING TO LISTEN
FOR THE DISTINCTIVE CALL

19:49.271 --> 19:49.688
OF THE RATTLESKUNKUPINE.

19:49.771 --> 19:50.606
[rattling]

19:50.689 --> 19:53.525
YOU HEAR THAT?

19:53.609 --> 19:56.361
I'D KNOW THAT RATTLE ANYWHERE.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.905
OH, HE'S CLOSE.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.281
IN FACT, I THINK HE'S

19:59.364 --> 20:01.408
RIGHT BEHIND ME!

USING MARACAS TO IMITATE
THE SOUND OF THE FEMALE.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.754
AND HE LOVES FRUIT!

20:13.837 --> 20:16.006
THAT OUGHT TO DRAW HIM OUT
FOR SURE.

20:16.089 --> 20:18.467
ACTUALLY, THAT GIVES ME
AN IDEA.

20:21.219 --> 20:23.472
I'LL JUST USE
THIS CUSTOM WHISTLE

20:23.555 --> 20:25.641
THAT ONLY RATTLESKUNKUPINES
CAN HEAR.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.601
IT'S SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED
TO DRIVE THEM CRAZY.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.937
- EEE!

20:30.020 --> 20:31.480
- [teeth chattering]

20:31.563 --> 20:32.856
- [inhales]

20:34.316 --> 20:36.735
- [screams]

20:36.818 --> 20:38.320
- JEEZ, FANBOY.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.988
IF YOU'RE GOING TO RANDOMLY
SCREAM LIKE THAT,

20:40.072 --> 20:41.865
I'M JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO BLOW HARDER.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.995
NOTHING YET.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.330
LET ME TRY THIS ONE;
IT MAKES HIM RUN IN CIRCLES.

20:53.126 --> 20:56.922
THIS ONE MAKES HIM FIRE
HIS QUILLS IN EVERY DIRECTION.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.131
- NO, DON'T DO THAT!

20:58.215 --> 21:00.384
- YOU'RE RIGHT; HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO IDENTIFY HIM

21:00.467 --> 21:02.052
WITHOUT HIS TRADEMARK QUILLS?
