00:00.150 --> 00:01.859
Previously on
<i>Black Lightning...</i>

00:02.070 --> 00:05.030
Tobias just unleashed a
different kind of meta on Freeland

00:05.033 --> 00:06.549
<i>for some kind of demonstration.</i>

00:06.550 --> 00:08.593
I think he's created
a mercenary army.

00:08.595 --> 00:09.895
<i>There were four of them.</i>

00:09.975 --> 00:11.905
They called themselves
the Masters of Disaster.

00:11.985 --> 00:12.749
How are they?

00:12.750 --> 00:15.485
They're actually better
than they've ever been before.

00:15.565 --> 00:18.455
Good. How long until they can be
awakened and join the prison metas?

00:21.695 --> 00:24.415
It's done. What's next?

00:24.425 --> 00:27.585
Freeland, huh?

00:27.655 --> 00:31.915
<i>Every meta-human
in Freeland is in danger.</i>

00:31.925 --> 00:34.925
<i>Wendy could prove
to be more revolutionary</i>

00:34.935 --> 00:37.185
<i>than the tank
or the machine gun.</i>

00:38.435 --> 00:40.885
There's nothing but pain
for me in this life.

00:40.965 --> 00:42.765
And who do you blame for that?

00:42.835 --> 00:44.265
Tobias Whale.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.735
Where Tobias goes,

00:45.805 --> 00:47.615
heartache is sure to follow.

00:47.685 --> 00:49.865
Then maybe he's better off dead.

00:51.015 --> 00:52.185
<i>I'm gonna make him pay.</i>

00:52.255 --> 00:53.605
I'm gonna put
Tobias Whale in the ground.

00:53.685 --> 00:54.945
It's Jen. She's here...

00:54.955 --> 00:56.575
She's wearing the suit.
It's not ready.

00:59.695 --> 01:00.955
I will find you.

01:25.465 --> 01:30.225
Don't shoot. Please, man, it's cool.
It's cool.

01:30.305 --> 01:31.935
It don't look cool.

01:32.015 --> 01:34.995
Just tell me one thing.
Are you with Tobias Whale?

01:36.405 --> 01:38.665
Definitely not
with Tobias Whale.

01:46.175 --> 01:47.505
Jen.

01:49.505 --> 01:54.345
Jennifer, it's your Uncle Gambi.
I'm here.

01:54.425 --> 01:58.685
People, Jennifer has a critical situation.
Lock in on my location.

01:58.755 --> 02:00.185
<i>On my way.</i>

02:00.255 --> 02:01.835
<i>I'm coming.</i>

02:01.915 --> 02:04.525
It's okay. It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
You hear me, Jen?

02:04.595 --> 02:06.395
Go to your safe space.

02:09.595 --> 02:12.525
You have to get out of here.
Hurry.

02:12.605 --> 02:14.025
What about you?

02:14.105 --> 02:16.695
I'm not really here, just a
manifestation of your mind,

02:16.775 --> 02:18.525
and you can't be here either.

02:18.535 --> 02:20.365
Get out of yourself, now.

02:20.375 --> 02:21.445
How?

02:21.525 --> 02:22.525
The answer is already...

02:22.595 --> 02:24.205
Is already inside of me.
I know that.

02:24.285 --> 02:25.945
I'm literally dying here.

02:26.025 --> 02:29.295
All right. Bat your eyelashes
and curl your toes.

02:30.215 --> 02:31.385
How is that gonna help?

02:31.455 --> 02:33.205
Flexing your power is as simple

02:33.215 --> 02:35.055
as finding the right muscle
and flexing it.

02:35.125 --> 02:37.085
So feel it. Flex it.
Pull it in.

02:37.095 --> 02:38.845
And get the hell out of here!

03:01.245 --> 03:02.285
Uncle Gambi?

03:02.985 --> 03:04.035
Uncle Gambi?

03:05.415 --> 03:08.295
Uncle Gambi, wake up. Wake up.

03:09.585 --> 03:11.915
Uncle Gambi, wake up.

03:19.505 --> 03:20.635
Jennifer.

03:21.705 --> 03:22.935
What happened? Are you okay?

03:23.005 --> 03:24.685
He tried to help me,
but I think he's dead.

03:26.975 --> 03:28.815
No, no.
I can see he still has a pulse.

03:36.445 --> 03:40.775
Lynn, I found Gambi unconscious
with radiation burns.

03:40.785 --> 03:43.405
Oh, my God. He needs a doctor.

03:43.475 --> 03:45.125
That would raise
a lot of questions.

03:47.455 --> 03:50.075
No, he's not that bad.
I'll give him a shot for the pain.

03:50.155 --> 03:53.075
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

03:53.155 --> 03:55.995
Okay. Put Gambi in the van.
You go with 'em.

03:56.005 --> 03:57.795
- Tell the van to take you to the sanctum.
- Okay.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.595
Make sure they get there.
Make sure she stays there.

03:59.675 --> 04:02.305
I'll take care of Gambi,
but what about you?

04:02.385 --> 04:04.305
Tobias bugged out.
I wanna check it out

04:04.385 --> 04:06.805
and see if he left any evidence
behind that'll stick.

04:06.885 --> 04:08.395
- Go.
- All right.

04:08.475 --> 04:11.975
I'll hit you when we get there.
Come on. All right.

04:12.045 --> 04:14.805
Yeah, I don't give a damn
who the hell it was.

04:14.815 --> 04:17.154
Running me out of my own building
because a dead man is comin'.

04:17.225 --> 04:19.565
I don't run from dead men,
I make 'em.

04:19.635 --> 04:21.815
You need to shut up or thank me.
One or the other.

04:21.894 --> 04:24.825
You gotta have a plan when you deal
with a meta-human or an enhanced.

04:33.655 --> 04:35.665
Maybe you're right.

04:35.735 --> 04:38.585
I've killed Black Lightning
and I've had him killed,

04:38.655 --> 04:41.175
but that bastard
keeps comin' back to cost me.

04:41.255 --> 04:44.175
He cost me Joey Toledo,
he cost me Syonide,

04:44.185 --> 04:45.765
now he wants to cost me this city.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.515
District Attorney
just announced...

04:51.005 --> 04:53.855
no charges for the cops
that shot that Cape Guy.

04:55.105 --> 04:57.025
- It's typical.
- Hmm.

04:58.605 --> 05:01.185
This boy's death
is an opportunity.

05:01.195 --> 05:02.855
The community could
really explode over this

05:02.865 --> 05:04.695
like LA did in the '90s.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.865
All it needs is a little push.

05:06.945 --> 05:09.075
The whole city will be
on its knees.

05:10.315 --> 05:12.375
While we send metas
to reclaim the pods.

05:12.455 --> 05:15.245
Yeah, and Black Lightning
is sure to show up.

05:15.255 --> 05:16.715
But I'm done with him
takin' from me.

05:16.785 --> 05:20.045
This time, I'm gonna
take his powers from him.

05:20.125 --> 05:23.465
I'm positive he generates his
power from the city's power grid.

05:23.545 --> 05:27.585
Send Coldsnap to freeze the main
generator until there's complete darkness.

05:27.605 --> 05:30.395
Then I'm takin' his life
for good.

06:14.448 --> 06:15.868
Dad, we're in.

06:15.878 --> 06:17.378
<i>Good.
Stay put.</i>

06:17.458 --> 06:18.508
Will do.

06:52.158 --> 06:53.128
Damn.

06:54.828 --> 06:56.628
I thought the Markovians
had you.

06:59.588 --> 07:01.418
- Lynn.
<i>- Yes, Jeff?</i>

07:01.428 --> 07:03.708
You are not gonna believe
what I just found.

07:03.788 --> 07:05.808
I have your GPS. I'm on my way.

07:13.298 --> 07:14.608
You think he's gonna be okay?

07:15.218 --> 07:16.718
Shoot.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.278
I wouldn't be surprised
if he told us he was Batman.

07:19.308 --> 07:20.598
He'll be fine, all right?

07:22.118 --> 07:24.228
You know, this is another one
I owe Tobias for.

07:24.308 --> 07:26.278
Look, you're right, baby sis,
but I need you to calm down, all right?

07:26.358 --> 07:28.238
No, I'm fine. I'm...

07:28.308 --> 07:30.528
Seeing him out of the blue like
that kind of caught me off guard.

07:30.608 --> 07:32.288
But it's cool.
I'm not gonna blow us up.

07:32.368 --> 07:34.328
Good, 'cause I got stuff to do.

07:35.648 --> 07:36.798
Yeah, I know, Harriet.

07:37.798 --> 07:39.288
Or should I say Blackbird?

07:39.298 --> 07:42.338
Well, I kind of like Blackbird.
She cool, right?

07:43.798 --> 07:45.738
You're such an overachiever.

07:45.738 --> 07:49.308
It's not enough you're in medical
school, you gotta be two superheroes.

07:49.378 --> 07:51.588
Or maybe just one now,
'cause of Dad's code.

07:51.668 --> 07:52.888
Nah, Blackbird is needed.

07:52.898 --> 07:54.968
But I will start planning better

07:54.978 --> 07:57.318
and stop lone-wolfing it.

07:57.388 --> 07:59.888
You know, I can roll with you.

07:59.968 --> 08:00.898
Anissa.

08:02.558 --> 08:03.968
Oh, he's burning up.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.608
- Look, I'm gonna give him some ibuprofen.
- Wait...

08:05.678 --> 08:06.978
I need you to get some
ice bags out the freezer.

08:06.988 --> 08:07.988
We gotta get
his temperature down.

08:08.068 --> 08:09.658
- Quick, all right?
- Okay.

08:09.738 --> 08:11.648
All right, stay with me,
Uncle Gambi.

08:11.668 --> 08:14.948
Don't you worry.
I'll handle my business.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.658
You just don't know
how to play chess.

08:16.738 --> 08:19.378
Never did.
I know what I'm doing.

08:25.368 --> 08:26.178
What?

08:31.178 --> 08:34.227
I set off violence in strategic
spots across the city.

08:35.378 --> 08:37.018
Handpicked members
of the One Hundred

08:37.097 --> 08:40.018
are snatching motorists out of
cars and setting stores on fire.

08:40.097 --> 08:41.847
And non-One Hundred members
are joining in.

08:41.857 --> 08:43.318
Of course they are.

08:47.268 --> 08:50.328
You know that's true.
Ignorant, weak-ass fools.

08:52.448 --> 08:55.318
Baby, maybe you need to get some sleep.
I mean, you've been up for...

08:55.398 --> 08:57.028
Don't you worry about my sleep.

08:57.108 --> 08:58.878
You just make sure you pullin'
Black Lightning's teeth

08:58.948 --> 09:00.248
like I told you to.

09:20.528 --> 09:21.358
No!

09:22.598 --> 09:23.438
Hey!

09:36.778 --> 09:38.708
Hey! Lynn...

09:40.588 --> 09:41.908
Bitch!

09:45.288 --> 09:46.538
I think you got her.

09:50.408 --> 09:52.588
Oh, you have a funny
bedside manner.

09:52.668 --> 09:54.918
You're in no position
to make jokes.

09:54.938 --> 09:57.088
This is true.

09:57.098 --> 10:02.598
But you must understand,
you cannot turn me over to the ASA.

10:02.608 --> 10:06.188
Agent Odell will realize I helped
Tobias, and he won't be forgiving.

10:06.258 --> 10:09.318
You just tried to John Wilkes Booth me.
Why do you think I care?

10:12.288 --> 10:14.608
I have information
that's valuable to you.

10:14.688 --> 10:16.268
We're not playing that game.

10:16.348 --> 10:18.118
Oh, you don't want to hear
about more homicidal meta-humans

10:18.198 --> 10:20.628
about to be turned loose
on Freeland?

10:24.968 --> 10:25.958
What do you want?

10:26.788 --> 10:28.128
Police protection.

10:28.208 --> 10:31.128
I much prefer the law-bound
criminal justice system

10:31.138 --> 10:35.098
to the national security
ruthlessness of the ASA.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.638
I'll see what I can do.

10:37.718 --> 10:39.798
I assumed as much...

10:39.808 --> 10:42.388
given the fact that there's no
Black Lightning task force formed

10:42.468 --> 10:44.468
to bring you to justice.

10:44.478 --> 10:48.098
You have a connect.
High level, I gather.

10:48.178 --> 10:51.488
Stop showing off.
Stop it!

10:51.568 --> 10:53.318
Black Lightning,
don't trust this woman.

10:53.328 --> 10:56.158
Not until she tells us
what she's got.

10:57.208 --> 10:59.358
Well?

10:59.438 --> 11:01.248
You're gonna want to
write this down.

11:52.788 --> 11:54.008
Dr. Stewart.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.748
What the hell?

11:56.748 --> 11:59.048
It looks like your
anonymous caller has struck again

11:59.058 --> 12:01.138
and led you to the pod kids.

12:03.298 --> 12:05.008
How are they?

12:05.018 --> 12:08.218
I haven't checked them all yet.
The ones I have are stable.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.728
Good. I'm gonna get 'em
out of here

12:10.738 --> 12:13.738
before the Markovians take
advantage of the chaos outside.

12:13.818 --> 12:15.898
No, that will destabilize them.

12:15.978 --> 12:19.738
Better that than stable
in Markovian hands.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.578
Get special teams in here.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.748
<i>Authorities are now
advising residents of Freeland</i>

12:27.828 --> 12:29.298
<i>to stay in their homes</i>

12:29.368 --> 12:31.078
<i>as the riots surrounding
the fatal shooting of Cape Guy</i>

12:31.158 --> 12:33.418
<i>continue to evoke chaos
in the city.</i>

12:34.738 --> 12:36.798
All right,
his vitals are getting stronger.

12:37.578 --> 12:38.548
Thank God.

12:40.008 --> 12:41.758
People wildin' out in these streets.

12:41.768 --> 12:43.088
Yo, that's 'cause
they pissed off,

12:43.098 --> 12:44.628
and they got every right to be.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.598
Yeah, but what is tearing up
your own community gonna do?

12:46.608 --> 12:49.938
Look. This dude is running down
the street with a TV.

12:50.018 --> 12:51.848
How the hell is that helping anything?

12:51.928 --> 12:53.438
That fool,
he just wanna get a TV.

12:53.448 --> 12:54.938
He ain't trying to create change.

12:54.948 --> 12:57.108
But the majority of the people
out there,

12:57.118 --> 12:58.988
they're trying to get the
attention of the powers that be.

13:46.188 --> 13:47.618
Freeland just went dark.

13:47.688 --> 13:49.378
<i>I know.
We just saw that.</i>

13:53.168 --> 13:55.168
That's Gambi's backup power.

13:56.008 --> 13:57.498
Yo, a power outage?

13:57.508 --> 13:59.588
You think
they're getting crazy now?

13:59.658 --> 14:01.508
They about to be acting
even more crazy.

14:07.081 --> 14:09.331
Hey, yo, Dad tripping.
Got me in here cooped up.

14:09.411 --> 14:10.841
This is killing me.

14:12.171 --> 14:13.831
I gotta get out there.

14:13.841 --> 14:15.321
And do what, exactly?

14:15.401 --> 14:17.511
I don't know, Jen.
But, look, I gotta do something.

14:17.591 --> 14:20.421
To who?
These are regular people.

14:20.501 --> 14:22.181
And on top of that,
what about Uncle Gambi?

14:23.501 --> 14:24.561
Least of your worries.

14:26.211 --> 14:27.591
Hey.

14:27.671 --> 14:28.761
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

14:28.841 --> 14:31.011
All right. Are you okay?

14:31.031 --> 14:33.601
Me? What about the whole
"look before you leap" thing?

14:33.681 --> 14:35.031
Why would you get so close to me

14:35.101 --> 14:36.531
when I've got energy
flying all over the place?

14:38.191 --> 14:39.701
Because you're my family.

14:41.701 --> 14:43.241
Now let's go check on your dad.

14:47.231 --> 14:48.701
Jeff?

14:48.711 --> 14:50.041
Jeff, do you read me?

14:50.121 --> 14:53.711
Oh, it's good to hear
your voice, old man.

14:53.791 --> 14:55.961
<i>You all right?</i>

14:56.031 --> 14:59.041
I've had worse.
Jeff, you gotta come in.

14:59.051 --> 15:02.461
No, I can't. I have to get back
to Lynn at Tobias's warehouse.

15:02.541 --> 15:06.171
The pods are there. If I know
Tobias, he's gonna want 'em back.

15:06.251 --> 15:07.631
Just tell Lynn to get out of there.

15:07.711 --> 15:09.061
Jeff,
you're almost out of juice.

15:09.141 --> 15:11.731
Without an energy supply,
you're gonna go down soon.

15:12.571 --> 15:13.731
Jeff?

15:14.591 --> 15:16.521
Jeff?

15:16.601 --> 15:19.231
- He cut the comm link.
- I'm out.

15:19.241 --> 15:21.781
- Hold up. I'm comin' with.
- Jen, no.

15:23.651 --> 15:25.991
Wait... Wait!
What are you doing?

15:26.061 --> 15:28.861
I need to get the lights back
on so your father can power up.

15:28.941 --> 15:30.281
Okay, I'm coming with you.

15:30.361 --> 15:32.121
- We need you to stay here.
- No, I'm not staying here.

15:32.191 --> 15:34.121
- You will if you're smart.
- I'm not smart, then.

15:34.201 --> 15:37.001
- Jennifer, trust me.
- No, you need to trust me.

15:37.071 --> 15:39.621
I can do this. The suit's done.

15:39.641 --> 15:43.181
The suit only stops an outside
source from overloading you.

15:43.261 --> 15:46.271
It is up to you to keep
a lid on your emotions.

15:48.081 --> 15:51.341
I understand that. I can.

15:51.361 --> 15:53.971
You've had no tactical training.

15:54.051 --> 15:57.611
Tell me what you need me to do,
and I'll do it. I promise.

15:59.451 --> 16:01.861
Or you can walk out,
and I'll just follow you anyway.

16:06.531 --> 16:08.951
All right.
Remember that promise.

16:09.711 --> 16:10.791
Let's go.

16:34.481 --> 16:35.561
Stop!

16:46.161 --> 16:47.491
Dr. Jace.

16:53.901 --> 16:57.671
Line-of-sight teleportation.
Interesting.

16:57.751 --> 17:00.011
You're wanted in Markovia.

17:02.181 --> 17:03.921
You're a bounty hunter.

17:03.991 --> 17:05.011
We're moving in.

17:06.641 --> 17:10.011
Whatever they're paying you,
I can get you more. Double.

17:10.080 --> 17:11.971
Yeah, I don't renegotiate.

17:12.040 --> 17:13.771
- Check him.
- No pulse.

17:14.421 --> 17:15.981
Move in. Go, go!

17:21.601 --> 17:22.691
All clear.

17:24.271 --> 17:25.981
We've got nothing, sir.

17:26.060 --> 17:27.121
They're gone.

17:38.751 --> 17:41.201
Can you smell it?

17:41.221 --> 17:43.381
The city's burning, Tori.
It's burning down.

17:44.871 --> 17:47.961
Nobody's gonna take
a damn thing from us anymore.

17:48.041 --> 17:52.631
And when I rebuild this city,
it'll be just the way we always wanted it.

18:02.681 --> 18:04.141
Put your hands
where we can see them!

18:04.221 --> 18:05.611
Do not move!

18:09.731 --> 18:11.861
- On your knees!
- Freeze!

18:11.941 --> 18:13.541
Do not move!

18:14.151 --> 18:15.081
Stop!

18:27.931 --> 18:30.601
Let me guess.
Tobias Whale sent you.

18:40.381 --> 18:42.441
- Hey, what's up?
- Glad you made it.

18:42.521 --> 18:43.941
Now we won't have to
hunt you down.

18:44.021 --> 18:45.271
Is that right?

18:59.461 --> 19:01.791
So you grab that one,
you grab that arm.

19:01.871 --> 19:02.841
Take me to him.

19:05.821 --> 19:07.461
- Ma'am, you can't come in right now.
- Hold on now.

19:07.471 --> 19:09.291
Hold on now.

19:09.301 --> 19:11.971
That's not who we are,
not in this church.

19:13.001 --> 19:14.221
Let 'em come on through.

19:15.811 --> 19:17.801
Let me tell you all something.

19:17.811 --> 19:22.971
If the good Lord can see fit to
raise me up off my deathbed...

19:24.711 --> 19:27.941
...we can see fit to raise our
neighbors in their time of need.

19:29.381 --> 19:31.651
I want you all to spread
the word that this church

19:31.661 --> 19:35.491
will serve as a place
of sanctuary during the riots.

19:35.571 --> 19:37.151
- Amen.
- Amen?

19:37.161 --> 19:38.501
- Amen.
- That's all right.

20:15.111 --> 20:18.321
Oh, yeah? Y'all ass is mine.

20:51.601 --> 20:52.951
The hell with this!

21:06.421 --> 21:09.251
I saw that you was
runnin' out of juice.

21:09.261 --> 21:13.211
I know we had beef for a long time,
but I ain't about that no more.

21:13.281 --> 21:17.421
My city don't need to be this
torn up. The streets need you.

21:17.431 --> 21:21.551
I'm only about one thing.
I'm gonna kill Tobias Whale.

21:23.841 --> 21:25.941
Your partner gettin' ready
to die over there.

21:31.041 --> 21:32.791
No!

21:46.248 --> 21:47.208
Hey.

21:58.168 --> 21:59.848
All right, Jen, come on up.

22:04.188 --> 22:05.258
Damn.

22:05.338 --> 22:06.558
The main generator's over here.

22:13.258 --> 22:15.528
That's crazy.

22:15.608 --> 22:18.698
Do you think you can control your powers
well enough to create small blasts?

22:18.778 --> 22:20.198
Yeah, of course.

22:20.278 --> 22:22.698
Okay. Controlled bursts.

22:22.768 --> 22:24.708
Hit it on both sides
at the same time.

22:25.358 --> 22:26.618
But not too hard,

22:26.688 --> 22:28.328
or you'll destroy the generator
behind the ice.

22:28.398 --> 22:29.338
I got it.

22:41.918 --> 22:44.228
- Hit it again, harder.
- Okay.

22:51.678 --> 22:53.148
One more time, just like that.

23:05.978 --> 23:08.078
Perfect. You okay?

23:08.088 --> 23:11.078
Hell no. I'm awesome.

23:20.268 --> 23:22.268
Yes, you are awesome. Let's go.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.478
The power's back on.

24:16.488 --> 24:19.268
Police aren't overreacting
like they're supposed to.

24:19.348 --> 24:21.148
My riot is dyin' out.

24:21.158 --> 24:23.818
It's that damn Black Lightning.
It's always Black Lightning.

24:23.828 --> 24:26.488
Thinks he can take my chaos.

24:26.498 --> 24:29.318
Wait till I put 12 dazed and
enraged meta-humans on his punk ass.

24:29.398 --> 24:31.078
No, don't, Tobias. Think.

24:31.158 --> 24:33.458
If you release the pods now,
we will lose everything we've worked...

24:33.538 --> 24:34.658
Get off me!

24:47.628 --> 24:49.188
So you gonna cut me now?

24:54.678 --> 24:55.608
No.

25:00.438 --> 25:02.068
But I'm leaving you.

25:08.398 --> 25:12.038
Like I give a damn.
I could have ten of you by tomorrow.

25:26.788 --> 25:28.508
Call reinforcements.

25:28.578 --> 25:33.178
Everyone here, hold.
Pods are the priority.

25:33.258 --> 25:35.768
Just give me five minutes
to initiate the serum, okay?

25:42.818 --> 25:46.898
Oh, my God. Wait.
No. No, wait! Wait!

25:46.978 --> 25:49.648
Stand back!
Everybody, don't touch them!

25:49.658 --> 25:53.078
Do it. Stand down. Stand down!

26:28.365 --> 26:29.655
<i>Jeff, Anissa.</i>

26:30.685 --> 26:32.695
We're looking at pod kids.

26:32.705 --> 26:33.643
<i>Don't do anything.</i>

26:33.645 --> 26:35.705
<i>They aren't fully awake,
and they could be erratic.</i>

27:13.745 --> 27:16.245
- Lynn.
- Oh, Jeff.

27:16.325 --> 27:18.195
- Hey.
- Oh, my God. Mom.

27:18.275 --> 27:20.745
- I'm okay.
- Okay, so they left you alone?

27:20.825 --> 27:24.205
I stepped aside to tell you that the
kids were out of the pods, and...

27:24.275 --> 27:26.255
turned around, and Odell
and his people were gone.

27:26.335 --> 27:27.665
<i>You're old news now, Lynn.</i>

27:27.745 --> 27:29.585
Those meta-humans
are out of the pods.

27:29.655 --> 27:31.095
Odell's gonna wanna claim them.

27:31.175 --> 27:32.595
<i>I'm not gonna let that happen.</i>

27:33.175 --> 27:34.655
No. No, hold on.

27:34.655 --> 27:37.095
With the information Dr. Jace
gave us for protection,

27:37.105 --> 27:40.095
I can trace the signal
that helped to open the pods.

27:40.105 --> 27:42.545
That'll be where
the briefcase is.

27:42.625 --> 27:44.605
<i>Yeah, and I bet anything
Tobias will be with the briefcase.</i>

27:45.945 --> 27:46.945
There.

27:49.285 --> 27:51.395
- All right.
- All right.

27:51.475 --> 27:53.075
- We'll see you.
- I'll be here.

27:56.145 --> 27:57.615
Almost back. Send me the GPS,

27:57.625 --> 27:58.825
and I'll support from the sanctum.

28:02.575 --> 28:04.085
Wait. I know where that is.

28:04.625 --> 28:06.525
Jen, no.

28:06.525 --> 28:09.795
If I can float in my sleep,
then I can probably fly while I'm awake.

28:28.225 --> 28:31.485
I know, right?
As soon as I kill Black Lightning,

28:31.565 --> 28:35.115
I'm gonna scoop up all those
poor, lost little meta-humans.

28:37.165 --> 28:38.165
Damn.

28:39.525 --> 28:41.165
You talkin' to paintings now?

28:42.565 --> 28:44.755
It's about time
I killed your ass.

28:44.825 --> 28:48.715
Latavious? Please.
The devil deals the cards.

28:53.535 --> 28:55.135
That don't work on me anymore.

28:59.045 --> 29:01.225
You think I never caught
any lead?

29:06.135 --> 29:08.525
The next one's goin'
right between your eyes.

29:08.605 --> 29:11.105
I don't think so.
<i>E pluribus unum.</i>

29:15.865 --> 29:17.445
Yeah, that one worked.

29:17.515 --> 29:20.155
Yeah. Do you feel that
bubbling up inside?

29:39.965 --> 29:41.385
What did you do?

29:41.455 --> 29:43.715
Lazarus Prime
only brought you back.

29:43.725 --> 29:45.615
I'm the one who brainwashed you.

29:45.695 --> 29:48.565
First level was about control.
You clearly passed that.

29:49.805 --> 29:52.145
Second level, way deeper.

29:52.215 --> 29:55.395
That passphrase was Latin
for, "From many, one."

29:57.145 --> 30:00.325
Bringin' out all the tattoos,
all the people you killed, at once.

30:00.405 --> 30:03.915
And your black ass certainly killed a
lot, directly and indirectly.

30:17.765 --> 30:20.675
Yeah, Tattoo-man.

30:20.745 --> 30:23.395
Go to sleep.

30:25.085 --> 30:26.925
The next time your ass wakes up,

30:26.935 --> 30:29.095
you're gonna be buried in some
concrete on the East Side.

30:32.975 --> 30:33.945
What?

30:36.175 --> 30:38.735
I know. He actually thought
that he had me.

30:42.985 --> 30:44.035
Who the hell are you?

30:45.195 --> 30:46.165
Call me Lightning.

30:47.125 --> 30:49.455
And this is payback.

30:51.945 --> 30:53.285
Let me down!

31:06.913 --> 31:07.863
Stop.

31:07.943 --> 31:09.073
He deserves it.

31:09.153 --> 31:10.253
But you don't!

31:12.113 --> 31:14.253
'Cause you don't deserve to
become a cold-blooded killer.

31:16.593 --> 31:18.213
Stop fighting me!

31:18.283 --> 31:19.653
I can't let him win.

31:19.733 --> 31:21.253
- You don't...
- I'm gonna kill you!

31:22.603 --> 31:24.753
Let go. Just let go.
You're hurting yourself.

31:24.773 --> 31:26.433
You know I can't let you.

31:28.963 --> 31:31.903
Kid, I'm gonna kill you.

31:36.643 --> 31:37.783
Are you okay?

31:39.513 --> 31:42.993
<i>When Tobias
came, I should've helped you.</i>

31:43.783 --> 31:44.773
Dad.

31:44.853 --> 31:46.183
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

31:46.183 --> 31:47.453
<i>There's nothing to be sorry for.</i>

31:48.453 --> 31:49.963
All the violence...

31:50.033 --> 31:52.123
Peace ain't always peaceful, son.

31:52.203 --> 31:55.243
All the blood, broken bones,
pain you suffered,

31:55.323 --> 31:57.843
only you'll ever know
if it was worth it.

32:00.263 --> 32:01.303
I love you, son.

32:02.473 --> 32:03.553
Love you, too, Dad.

32:06.143 --> 32:08.723
Are you okay?

32:10.723 --> 32:11.893
Yeah.

32:11.973 --> 32:13.193
Oh, no, you ain't!

32:15.653 --> 32:16.773
- Please.
- Please.

32:26.163 --> 32:27.333
He's mine.

32:29.733 --> 32:30.583
Come on!

32:36.573 --> 32:37.503
Get him!

32:52.023 --> 32:54.443
<i>Is this thing on here?</i>

32:54.513 --> 32:56.353
I don't know if you all
can hear me out there.

32:56.363 --> 32:58.473
Yes, Father.

32:58.553 --> 33:01.523
If you're out there in the
community, this is Reverend Holt,

33:01.533 --> 33:03.193
coming to you by radio,

33:03.203 --> 33:05.773
and I'm coming to you
by podcast.

33:05.853 --> 33:09.863
But mostly, I'm coming to you

33:09.873 --> 33:12.703
through the grace
of the Almighty God.

33:12.783 --> 33:14.033
- Yeah!
- Come on!

33:15.953 --> 33:18.253
Because it's only through
God's love...

33:19.403 --> 33:21.373
...that I live and I breathe.

33:21.383 --> 33:23.093
- Amen!
- Praise God.

33:23.173 --> 33:26.803
As you all know here in the church
and out there in the community,

33:28.583 --> 33:31.063
I was struck down
and left in a coma.

33:32.633 --> 33:35.223
Oh, but the God I serve
had another plan.

33:38.593 --> 33:42.403
That's right. That's right.
That's right.

33:42.483 --> 33:46.573
See, I was struck down
by the evil here in Freeland.

33:47.973 --> 33:52.993
And we have all in this
church felt that evil.

33:53.003 --> 33:57.253
<i>See, I praise God
for sending us Black Lightning,</i>

33:58.593 --> 34:01.463
<i>an angel of justice
to fight that evil.</i>

34:04.263 --> 34:07.933
<i>I praise God that
he gave us Thunder</i>

34:09.842 --> 34:12.143
<i>to protect and inspire us.</i>

34:15.103 --> 34:20.393
<i>I'm telling you, be you man,
a woman, or meta-human,</i>

34:20.473 --> 34:22.402
<i>we all have a part to play.</i>

34:22.483 --> 34:25.443
<i>So just as God's love
sent us Black Lightning,</i>

34:25.523 --> 34:27.773
<i>and God's love sent us Thunder,</i>

34:27.783 --> 34:32.193
<i>it was God's love that allowed
me to rise up off my deathbed.</i>

34:32.273 --> 34:34.013
<i>And I'm telling you
right here in the church,</i>

34:34.013 --> 34:36.283
<i>and I'm telling all of y'all
out there in the community,</i>

34:36.293 --> 34:38.353
<i>Freeland will rise again.</i>

34:38.353 --> 34:42.963
<i>All we have to do is hold on to
faith and love in our hearts.</i>

34:47.043 --> 34:49.473
Now, it took evil to start this unrest.

34:50.143 --> 34:52.882
But love will stop it.

34:52.963 --> 34:55.973
Let me hear somebody say,
"Love will stop it."

34:55.983 --> 34:59.313
Love can stop it!
Love can stop it!

35:37.173 --> 35:39.843
I'm the captain
of the guard of this shift.

35:39.853 --> 35:42.353
Allow me to welcome you
to the Pit.

35:42.363 --> 35:44.523
The collar you wear around your
neck nullifies your strength,

35:44.603 --> 35:45.853
so you can stop trying to use it.

35:45.863 --> 35:48.853
You can't keep me here.
I want my lawyer.

35:52.533 --> 35:54.643
You don't get one.

35:54.723 --> 35:58.153
You've been classified a clear and present
meta-human threat to national security.

35:58.233 --> 36:00.873
The Pit is a black site
which exists on no map

36:00.953 --> 36:02.703
and from which
there is no escape.

36:02.783 --> 36:07.593
In other words, abandon all hope
of the life you knew before.

36:08.553 --> 36:11.223
Now there's just the Pit.

36:50.493 --> 36:53.423
Yeah, well, I'm just happy none of the
pod kids hurt anybody when they got out.

36:53.493 --> 36:55.593
I know.
That was my greatest fear.

36:57.433 --> 36:58.433
I'm proud of you.

37:02.103 --> 37:03.103
What?

37:03.923 --> 37:05.193
I said I'm proud of you.

37:07.313 --> 37:10.363
Is this some kind of
April fool-joke setup?

37:11.643 --> 37:14.033
No. You handled your business.

37:17.523 --> 37:21.113
Well, not all the pod kids
have been found. I mean...

37:21.123 --> 37:24.463
I guess some of them went into
hiding, afraid to use their powers

37:24.533 --> 37:26.413
in fear of being
put back in the pods.

37:26.483 --> 37:30.623
Mom, like you always tell me,
celebrate the victory.

37:30.633 --> 37:32.593
Worry about the problem
when it presents itself.

37:34.633 --> 37:38.093
Lynn, take the compliment.

37:38.163 --> 37:41.133
- I'm sorry. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:41.143 --> 37:43.263
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did I miss a moment?

37:43.333 --> 37:44.813
Yeah.

37:44.893 --> 37:47.093
My younger daughter
just gave me a compliment.

37:47.173 --> 37:49.433
- Oh. How'd that feel?
- Great.

37:49.513 --> 37:52.483
- Well, I made cobbler for us.
- Ooh.

37:52.563 --> 37:53.993
My recipe or your dad's?

37:54.063 --> 37:55.233
'Cause if it's Dad's...

37:55.303 --> 37:56.483
No, no, no. It's Mom's.

37:56.493 --> 37:57.813
Okay, great.

37:57.893 --> 37:59.163
Wait, wait.
What's wrong with mine?

38:01.063 --> 38:01.993
What's right with it?

38:04.023 --> 38:06.993
Harsh. That's harsh.

38:07.003 --> 38:08.283
It's a little harsh,
but it's true.

38:08.363 --> 38:09.413
You have to put peaches
in it, one.

38:09.493 --> 38:11.493
Yeah, just a little
more peaches.

38:11.513 --> 38:12.873
- It's just bread.
- What?

38:12.953 --> 38:14.663
Just a bunch of bread.

38:14.743 --> 38:16.583
You do a lot of things
great, but it's just not one of them.

38:16.663 --> 38:17.963
No, there are no peaches.

38:18.043 --> 38:19.053
Yeah, right.

38:19.133 --> 38:20.343
It just does anything for me.

38:24.923 --> 38:26.853
Dad, you know
I was just playin'.

38:30.693 --> 38:31.693
Jeff, what's...

38:32.693 --> 38:34.563
What's wrong, baby?

38:34.643 --> 38:36.993
- Dad, for real.
- I'm fine.

38:38.183 --> 38:39.363
No, you're crying.

38:39.373 --> 38:41.203
I'm...

38:42.703 --> 38:43.873
I'm happy.

38:46.693 --> 38:48.163
You walked through that door.

38:49.693 --> 38:53.553
Your mom is here.
Jen is here. We're safe.

38:58.893 --> 39:00.893
I worry all the time.

39:01.623 --> 39:02.643
Baby, we're here.

39:04.133 --> 39:05.303
We're together.

39:05.373 --> 39:06.713
- We're all here. We're fine.
- I know.

39:06.793 --> 39:09.263
You know, sometimes
I just want to quit all of it.

39:09.273 --> 39:11.053
I just want to take you all

39:11.063 --> 39:14.733
and take you somewhere
far away from here, but...

39:16.093 --> 39:17.073
I can't.

39:18.153 --> 39:19.403
And I feel guilty

39:21.743 --> 39:23.493
because we got cobbler,

39:24.903 --> 39:26.373
family dinners,

39:27.623 --> 39:30.043
and so many people
in Freeland don't.

39:32.753 --> 39:34.093
We all deserve this.

39:36.033 --> 39:38.083
And I shouldn't have to
hold my breath

39:38.093 --> 39:39.763
until all of you
walk through that door,

39:39.833 --> 39:40.883
but I do.

39:44.253 --> 39:45.513
And I'm not the only one.

39:48.603 --> 39:49.603
Baby.

39:50.353 --> 39:51.313
No...

39:53.423 --> 39:56.773
I'm happy.
I'm happy. I'm happy.

39:56.783 --> 39:59.443
I'm happy you are home.

39:59.453 --> 40:00.943
Look, I know I'm always late.

40:00.953 --> 40:02.613
I promise I won't be late
no more.

40:02.683 --> 40:04.523
- I won't. Don't.
- Good.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.283
Stop laughing at me.

40:06.293 --> 40:09.113
- Oh! Saved by the song.
- Oh,

40:09.123 --> 40:11.453
This is my jam, honey.

40:11.463 --> 40:12.783
- Come on.
- It's all your jam.

40:12.793 --> 40:14.353
- Dance with me.
- No, you're...

40:14.353 --> 40:15.953
- Oh, my rheumatism is acting up.
- Oh, those old knees?

40:15.963 --> 40:17.413
Come on.
You still got some moves.

40:17.493 --> 40:18.633
Now, come on. Dance with me.

40:20.713 --> 40:21.763
Good evening.

40:24.043 --> 40:25.883
Let's skip the prelims.

40:25.963 --> 40:30.643
I know exactly who
and what you all are.

40:31.423 --> 40:32.643
You need to leave.

40:32.723 --> 40:34.973
There's something
you need to know.

40:34.983 --> 40:39.273
The Markovians have a stockpile
of meta-humans in pods.

40:39.343 --> 40:41.493
The largest on Earth.

40:43.063 --> 40:44.703
You've been asked to leave...

40:46.403 --> 40:47.783
nicely.

40:50.503 --> 40:53.573
Not yet, Mr. Pierce.

40:53.583 --> 40:56.833
Thanks to you,
the Markovians have Dr. Jace.

40:56.913 --> 40:58.333
And here is the best part.

40:58.343 --> 41:01.833
The concentration of
meta-humans in Freeland

41:01.843 --> 41:05.843
from the vaccines
and the Green Light experiment

41:05.913 --> 41:10.463
make it the greatest threat
to Markovia.

41:10.543 --> 41:14.843
It's only a matter of time before
they launch a lethal first strike.

41:14.923 --> 41:17.513
I'm swearing in
Black Lightning, Thunder,

41:17.593 --> 41:20.483
and whatever you're calling
yourself, young lady.

41:22.903 --> 41:26.863
The Markovian War is coming.

41:26.943 --> 41:28.573
And Freeland...

41:29.603 --> 41:31.043
Freeland

41:32.453 --> 41:33.963
is ground zero.
