00:09.096 --> 00:09.313
.

00:09.357 --> 00:11.315
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:11.359 --> 00:12.621
sexually based offenses

00:12.664 --> 00:14.623
are considered
especially heinous.

00:14.666 --> 00:17.321
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:17.365 --> 00:19.193
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:19.236 --> 00:20.585
are members of an elite squad

00:20.629 --> 00:22.370
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:22.413 --> 00:25.503
These are their stories.

00:25.547 --> 00:27.244
- Come on!
Three more.

00:27.288 --> 00:29.333
Harder!
As hard as you can!

00:29.377 --> 00:30.900
Two!

00:30.943 --> 00:32.684
One more.

00:32.728 --> 00:35.078
Nice--and rest.

00:36.862 --> 00:38.690
- Nice.
- Oh, my God.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.083
That felt great.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.085
- You were killing it,
Olivia.

00:42.129 --> 00:45.306
- Okay...gotta get back
to the station.

00:45.349 --> 00:46.959
- Oh, that excuse.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.787
- Ha!

00:48.831 --> 00:50.137
- Oh!

00:50.180 --> 00:52.269
I have my son's
parent-teacher conference.

00:52.313 --> 00:53.575
- I have 7:00 p.m. open.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.925
- That's when I actually
get to see my son.

00:55.968 --> 00:57.100
How 'bout--how 'bout
this?

00:57.144 --> 00:58.493
You move in with me...

00:58.536 --> 01:01.757
Then you can make me
do squats

01:01.800 --> 01:03.411
while I cook Noah dinner.

01:03.454 --> 01:05.413
I'll text you.
- Okay.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.806
- I'll even run back to my car.
- Deal!

01:09.895 --> 01:12.289
- Good morning, everyone!

01:12.333 --> 01:15.771
Welcome to Accredo's
Female Entrepreneur Workshop.

01:21.690 --> 01:23.083
- Hello, everybody.

01:23.126 --> 01:25.346
I am Claudia.
I'm your hostess.

01:26.347 --> 01:30.177
This--this group taught me
to take back my power.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.396
I went from
schlepping briefcases

01:32.440 --> 01:33.745
for the senior partners

01:33.789 --> 01:36.400
to head of
the litigation department.

01:36.444 --> 01:39.360
And, well...
look at this place.

01:39.403 --> 01:41.927
But I deserve it,
right?

01:45.888 --> 01:48.151
- Who would like
to share?

01:49.326 --> 01:51.415
- Oh, it's okay.
Let someone else go.

01:51.459 --> 01:53.591
- But your story is
so inspiring.

01:53.635 --> 01:56.116
Please.

01:56.159 --> 01:58.640
Thank you.

01:58.683 --> 02:01.991
- When I first
discovered Accredo,

02:02.034 --> 02:05.081
my career...
my life...

02:05.125 --> 02:07.257
were both stalled.

02:07.301 --> 02:09.259
I was in
an abusive relationship

02:09.303 --> 02:11.087
that held me back.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.438
But now, I am
stronger than ever,

02:14.482 --> 02:16.788
ready to take on the future.

02:23.839 --> 02:26.842
- Hey, I can walk you to
the subway, if you want.

02:26.885 --> 02:27.973
- No, I'll be fine.

02:28.017 --> 02:30.062
- Yeah.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.500
- Okay.
I'll see ya later.

02:33.675 --> 02:36.808
- I am starving!
This empowered woman

02:36.852 --> 02:38.636
can't live on
cucumber water alone.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.551
- I didn't think you
ever ate.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.814
Wanna go for lunch?

02:42.858 --> 02:45.121
There's this great Italian
place around the corner.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.166
It's got gluten-free pasta.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.168
- I can't--not today.

02:52.041 --> 02:54.783
Is it your ex?
- No, no.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.306
- Because if he's stalking
you again--

02:56.350 --> 02:58.743
- It's not him.
I'm fine, Lilah, okay?

02:58.787 --> 03:01.224
I'm just...busy.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.530
I'll see you later?

03:02.573 --> 03:05.315

Brett.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.526
I saw him outside the loft.
I was like,

08:46.569 --> 08:48.223
well, great.
Now he's stalking me.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.791
- Did Vicky have any
other friends or family?

It really messed her up.

08:56.187 --> 09:00.191

She seemed a lot better lately.

09:01.671 --> 09:05.022
- Confident.
Happier.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.937
She'd joined some women's
empowerment group.

09:06.981 --> 09:09.592
I guess they couldn't
protect her from

09:09.636 --> 09:12.813
the dark side of
her life after all.

09:12.856 --> 09:15.467
- Negative for semen DNA.

09:15.511 --> 09:16.860
M.E. puts the time of death

09:16.904 --> 09:18.949
between 9:00 and 10:00.

09:18.993 --> 09:21.430

Nothing off the table leg.

I figure he might
be impotent.

cell records and financials.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.436

from a burner.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.699

shortly after that at 8:50.

09:29.743 --> 09:30.744
- Okay, what about
social media?

09:30.787 --> 09:32.397
- No Instagram or Twitter.

09:32.441 --> 09:34.225
And it looks like she closed
her Facebook account.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.880
- She had just quit a job.
She--she dumped a boyfriend.

09:36.924 --> 09:39.230
- Those female empowerment
classes did the trick.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.493
-Yeah, until last night.

09:41.537 --> 09:43.713
- Her girlfriend said she was
feeling bad about herself

09:43.757 --> 09:45.454
till she joined a ladies group.

09:45.497 --> 09:47.717
- And her last ten checks were
made out to this organization

09:47.761 --> 09:49.501
called Accredo, Inc.

09:49.545 --> 09:50.807
- It's all about
female empowerment.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.026
"It's a safe space where

09:52.069 --> 09:53.375
"goddesses can
speak their truth

09:53.418 --> 09:54.855
and live their dreams."

09:54.898 --> 09:57.118
- Well, let's hope
that she opened up to them.

09:59.860 --> 10:02.340
- Who knew there was
so much money in insecurity?

10:02.384 --> 10:03.646
- Sign of the times, Rollins.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.213
You can always tell
a society's priorities

10:05.256 --> 10:06.780
by looking at
their bestsellers.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.303
In the '70s is
"The Joy of Sex."

10:08.346 --> 10:10.784
The '80s is getting rich.
The '90s, staying young.

10:10.827 --> 10:14.222
- Now it's female empowerment.
- What women want.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.100
- Hi. You're here for
Arlo's lecture?

10:23.144 --> 10:25.015

10:29.672 --> 10:31.674
Arlo loves seeing new faces.
- Actually, we're here

10:31.718 --> 10:33.589
to talk about
Vicky Parson.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.982
Why?

10:35.025 --> 10:36.548
- Shh.

10:36.592 --> 10:39.639
- We all want things in life.

10:39.682 --> 10:41.162
You know?
To be happy...

10:41.205 --> 10:43.947
Hi, welcome.
To be fulfilled.

10:43.991 --> 10:47.298

But the question is,

10:47.342 --> 10:49.692
how do we get out of
our own way?

10:49.736 --> 10:51.955
How do we allow ourselves
to feel deserving

10:51.999 --> 10:54.131
of everything we want?

10:54.175 --> 10:56.568
I-I know you've struggled,
Claudia,

10:56.612 --> 10:59.049

10:59.093 --> 11:00.660

Look!
Look at where you are.

11:03.314 --> 11:04.576
I--

11:04.620 --> 11:08.319
I am gobsmacked by you.
I-I'm in awe.

11:09.233 --> 11:11.279
- You gave me permission
to love myself.

11:11.322 --> 11:13.585
I never looked back.

11:13.629 --> 11:14.978
- Hmm.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.502
Welcome.
I'm Arlo Beck.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.504

You've been hurt

Of course.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.502
She attended a workshop

Brad's the reason

12:19.347 --> 12:21.218
why Vicky came to Accredo.
He was abusive.

12:21.262 --> 12:23.307

account last week,

12:23.351 --> 12:27.442
and...he posted
these intimate photos.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.401
Yeah, here.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.360
You can see the caption.

You deserve to die."

time you saw her?

12:52.859 --> 12:54.295

12:54.338 --> 12:55.687
a lot better than that, Brad.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.472

two nights ago.

13:00.692 --> 13:03.347

to do with her being murdered.

13:03.391 --> 13:05.523

anything to do with these?

13:07.917 --> 13:09.049

why she dropped your ass.

I was holding her back.

She's an unemployed
public school teacher,

13:17.361 --> 13:18.710
for Christ's sakes.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.321
You're writing
your Nobel Prize speech?

my own joint someday.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.193

potatoes.

13:23.237 --> 13:24.804
You know, they got
a lot of mashed potatoes

13:24.847 --> 13:27.676

Yeah, on Leroy Street.
That's where I was.

That is one block away

13:39.079 --> 13:40.602

Vicky was murdered.

So what happened, huh?

You get drunk?
You go back over to

I did not kill her.

I was angry.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.664
Well, whoever murdered
Vicky was very angry.

13:59.708 --> 14:02.842
- Thirteen stab wounds.
Raped her with a table leg.

is why would you carve

14:07.194 --> 14:08.543

the daddy, are you?

21:54.922 --> 22:00.536
♪

22:04.758 --> 22:07.761

Classical Civilizations

22:07.804 --> 22:10.241
and Astrobiology
from Cambridge.

22:10.285 --> 22:13.767

He deferred a post doc

22:13.810 --> 22:15.899
position at NASA
to move to the Amazon

22:15.943 --> 22:17.771

the Piraha Tribe

22:17.814 --> 22:20.295
for three years to study
the true meaning of happiness.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.775

22:21.818 --> 22:23.124

okay.

22:23.167 --> 22:24.952
- Okay, he started Accredo
with a woman named

22:24.995 --> 22:27.433
Marina Basso.
I didn't meet her, did you?

22:30.523 --> 22:32.046
Oh, my God,

22:32.089 --> 22:34.527
we divorced six years ago.
- Hold on.

22:34.570 --> 22:36.485
You two were married?
- For two years.

22:36.529 --> 22:38.748
- After you two
started Accredo?

22:39.662 --> 22:41.360
- All things must die.

22:41.403 --> 22:42.752

it's doing very well.

22:44.406 --> 22:45.668

22:45.712 --> 22:47.627

I ever met.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.019
And empathetic.

22:49.063 --> 22:50.891
- That's what he calls
branding women?

22:52.632 --> 22:53.894
- Oh, you didn't know
about that?

22:53.937 --> 22:57.680
- No.
But I'm not surprised.

22:57.724 --> 23:00.291
It's like a dog marking
his territory, I suppose.

23:01.902 --> 23:05.079
- He's possessive, obsessive,
reclusive, outgoing,

23:05.122 --> 23:07.995
introspective, and could
charm meat from a lion...

23:08.038 --> 23:10.606
or should I say
a lioness?

23:10.650 --> 23:12.303
It was all a little
too much to live with.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.436
- So, you have nothing
to do with Accredo anymore?

23:14.480 --> 23:16.264
- Not at all.
- Okay, then...

23:16.307 --> 23:17.657
Why did you walk away?

23:19.093 --> 23:22.401
- If you must know...
it was completely personal.

23:22.444 --> 23:26.361
I found out that Arlo
had been sleeping with Lilah.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.842
- That must have
pissed you off.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.063
- Actually, what pissed me off

23:33.107 --> 23:34.935
is he said it
was for my own good.

23:34.978 --> 23:37.459
To help me get past
my jealousy issues.

23:37.503 --> 23:41.376
I'm sorry.
Nobody's that charming.

23:41.420 --> 23:45.467
- So the egotistical male
leader of an all-female group

23:45.511 --> 23:47.382
is sleeping with
one of his acolytes.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.601
It's not a shock.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.472
- It's also not illegal.

23:50.516 --> 23:51.908
- Or a motive for
Vicky's murder.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.170
- Okay, what I don't
buy is that Gina

23:53.214 --> 23:54.824
just happened to run
into Brad.

23:54.868 --> 23:56.347
This was orchestrated
so that she could plant

23:56.391 --> 23:57.958
that blood in his apartment.

23:58.001 --> 24:00.003
- Or he killed her and we're
barking up a dead tree.

24:00.047 --> 24:02.266
- This guy Arlo has something
to do with this somehow.

24:02.310 --> 24:04.704
- Okay, you said that Vicky
wrote ten checks to Accredo?

24:04.747 --> 24:06.314
- Yeah, for almost 20 grand.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.664
- He'd need a thousand Vickys
to buy a house like that.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.840
- Arlo's not gonna give
us his financials.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.276
- Talk to one of
the other women.

24:12.320 --> 24:15.018
- Here we go. Let's meet
the women of Accredo.

24:15.062 --> 24:17.368

River Park, 12:00 p.m.

24:17.412 --> 24:19.283

24:19.327 --> 24:21.329

24:25.725 --> 24:30.512
into upward facing dog,
into downward dog.

24:30.556 --> 24:34.690
Left leg comes through,
warrior two.

24:34.734 --> 24:37.867
Control the breath.
Check your heart rate,

24:37.911 --> 24:39.826
by pulse or by FitTrakr.

24:39.869 --> 24:42.393
We've been advised not
to talk to the police anymore.

24:42.437 --> 24:43.656
Arlo?

24:43.699 --> 24:44.874
- He has our best interests
at heart.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.485
- What about Vicky's
best interest?

24:46.528 --> 24:48.051
- Lower all the way down.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.531
- Lilah...

24:49.575 --> 24:51.751
I-it's him again.

24:55.972 --> 24:57.931
- Keep doing what you
were doing.

25:00.281 --> 25:03.545
- Hi. NYPD, you mind if we
talk to you for a second?

25:03.589 --> 25:05.112
- I wasn't doing anything.

25:05.155 --> 25:07.027
- You like taking pictures
of all the pretty girls?

25:07.070 --> 25:08.768
- No, just that Accredo Cult.

25:08.811 --> 25:09.986
I'm gonna find something.

25:10.030 --> 25:11.074
- What are you talking
about?

25:11.118 --> 25:12.554
- They brainwashed my wife.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.949
- Gina Goodrich.
Here.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.171
That's her.

25:23.652 --> 25:25.306
- Screw that.
Look, I just want my money.

25:25.349 --> 25:28.439
You gotta arrest them.
Charging people for this crap.

25:28.483 --> 25:31.791
- Let me see this.

25:35.838 --> 25:37.840
- Whoa.
Hold on a second.

25:39.494 --> 25:43.150
- It's Vicky.

25:43.193 --> 25:46.414
We're taking this.
- Be my guest.

25:48.329 --> 25:50.505
- I told you all I know.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.595
Sit down.

25:53.639 --> 25:56.685
- Somehow you forgot
about this.

26:01.951 --> 26:03.953
That's part of the process.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.000
- It's called starting over.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.828
- That looks more like
the tail end of a brawl.

26:08.871 --> 26:10.699
- What were you guys
fighting about, Gina?

26:10.743 --> 26:11.831
- I didn't kill her.

26:11.874 --> 26:13.484
- I didn't ask you that.

26:13.528 --> 26:14.703
- It works.

26:14.747 --> 26:15.965
It's part of
the Accredo method.

26:17.750 --> 26:20.143
- No, they pay to
earn self-respect.

26:20.187 --> 26:23.190
Nobody gives that to a woman.

26:23.233 --> 26:26.715
She has to work--
work hard to realize it.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.283
- Let me tell you where
you are, Gina.

26:29.326 --> 26:32.112
Your friend is dead.
And you were two blocks

26:32.155 --> 26:33.940
from the house the night
she was murdered,

26:33.983 --> 26:36.159
raped with a foreign object,
and mutilated.

26:36.203 --> 26:39.075
- And don't forget,
Gina was with Vicky's ex.

26:39.119 --> 26:41.600
- Yeah, and now
we see this photo of you

26:41.643 --> 26:42.992
putting your foot on
her face?

26:43.036 --> 26:45.212
Believe me,
it's not a stretch for a jury

26:45.255 --> 26:46.822
to say, "Yeah.
That bitch is guilty."

26:46.866 --> 26:49.869
- I didn't kill her.
- I don't believe you.

26:49.912 --> 26:52.698
- Jury's understand
love triangles, Gina.

26:54.874 --> 26:57.311
- Vicky was my serf.

26:58.704 --> 26:59.922
- I was her lord.

26:59.966 --> 27:01.750
She had to do whatever
I wanted.

27:05.275 --> 27:08.670
- She wouldn't advance to the
next level of self-realization.

27:10.324 --> 27:11.673
What happens there?

27:11.717 --> 27:13.022
- You're making fun of me.

27:13.066 --> 27:14.676
- I'm trying to help you.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.417
- Screw this.

27:18.332 --> 27:20.769
- Get on the floor.

27:20.813 --> 27:22.379
- Get on the damn floor.

She wants to feel demeaned?

27:30.300 --> 27:31.693
I'll demean her.

in prison, Lieutenant.

27:33.347 --> 27:34.870

the money you gave Arlo.

27:34.914 --> 27:38.700

Arlo is a con man.

27:38.744 --> 27:40.136

told me to do.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.718

the blood?

28:00.156 --> 28:03.464
