WEBVTT

00:41.975 --> 00:42.805
Hmm?

00:42.908 --> 00:45.500
Oh! You're already here!

00:45.609 --> 00:50.303
Well, in that case, greetings,
noble <i>signores</i> and <i>signorinas,</i>

00:50.409 --> 00:54.807
ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
and, of course, their pets!

00:56.109 --> 00:58.768
<i>The story I'm about to tell you</i>

00:58.842 --> 01:02.707
<i>is mysterious
and full of great wonders.</i>

01:04.276 --> 01:08.106
<i>You may have heard that once upon a time,</i>

01:08.209 --> 01:12.801
<i>a man named geppetto
carved a puppet out of wood.</i>

01:16.075 --> 01:20.008
But then, people started
making up some silly stories

01:20.109 --> 01:22.633
about growing noses and whatnot.

01:22.742 --> 01:23.902
Tell me,

01:23.975 --> 01:27.965
have you ever seen a nose
grow right in front of you?

01:29.142 --> 01:30.438
Here's an idea.

01:30.542 --> 01:32.906
Why don't you make yourselves comfortable,

01:32.975 --> 01:37.408
and I'll tell you all about what really
happened to the wooden boy?

01:37.476 --> 01:40.374
Sound good? Then here we go!

02:15.242 --> 02:16.299
There you go.

02:17.808 --> 02:19.297
You can sit at the table...

02:21.009 --> 02:23.271
And I won't feel so lonely.

02:24.342 --> 02:27.331
I will think of you as my own son.
All right?

02:29.276 --> 02:31.470
Now, what should we name you?

02:32.476 --> 02:34.101
Giuseppe?

02:34.209 --> 02:37.403
Eh... no. I know a guy by that name.

02:37.476 --> 02:41.204
He's my neighbor.
A drunk with a red nose.

02:41.276 --> 02:43.106
Maybe Leonardo?

02:44.276 --> 02:46.242
That won't do either.

02:46.309 --> 02:48.298
He'd grow up to be a selfish actor,

02:48.409 --> 02:52.103
or an artist, or a turtle who only
cares about pizza.

02:55.109 --> 02:58.598
Let's see. Your name will be...

02:58.675 --> 03:00.073
Pinocchio!

03:00.142 --> 03:01.267
Ahem.

03:02.276 --> 03:05.243
Personally, I find
his appearance rather dull.

03:05.309 --> 03:08.207
Don't you agree, my dear geppetto?

03:08.276 --> 03:11.606
I understand I might be
a boring companion,

03:11.708 --> 03:16.540
but you could have made a more joyful
and intelligent puppet.

03:16.608 --> 03:21.803
Tibalt, you're probably
the only talking horse in the world.

03:21.908 --> 03:24.500
I was glad to invite you to my home.

03:24.608 --> 03:29.064
But I don't think it gives you the right
to criticize this fine work!

03:33.808 --> 03:35.070
Hmm...

03:35.142 --> 03:38.370
That's probably the guest
I've been waiting for.

03:47.042 --> 03:50.407
Well, and look who's got upset here.

03:50.476 --> 03:53.135
These artists can be so sensitive.

04:11.908 --> 04:15.034
There you go, my pretty <i>signora</i> lyusilda.

04:15.109 --> 04:17.541
I've fixed your wand, just like you asked.

04:17.608 --> 04:21.041
Thank you very much, geppetto,
my dear old friend.

04:21.109 --> 04:24.598
You truly are exceptionally gifted!

04:24.675 --> 04:27.142
What can I ever do to repay you?

04:27.242 --> 04:30.674
From you, <i>signora,</i> a mere "thank you"
is more than enough.

04:30.775 --> 04:32.571
That really is all I need.

04:32.642 --> 04:34.268
In that case,

04:34.342 --> 04:37.740
from the bottom of my heart,
thank you again.

04:37.808 --> 04:41.139
- It was very nice seeing you.
- Bye-bye!

04:49.476 --> 04:50.908
Well, caro?

04:50.975 --> 04:53.737
Should we surprise our dear old friend?

04:53.808 --> 04:56.400
Of course! I know it will be...

04:56.476 --> 04:57.999
No.

04:58.109 --> 05:03.008
This time, we'll do something
more interesting and magical!

05:16.975 --> 05:19.305
Hmm? Oh.

05:19.409 --> 05:21.875
Huh. What's that sound?

05:21.942 --> 05:26.000
Or is it my ears ringing again?

05:26.109 --> 05:29.564
Oh! Pinocchio!
What happened, my boy?

05:30.908 --> 05:33.636
Let's get you back up.

05:33.742 --> 05:35.300
That's better.

05:36.808 --> 05:38.104
Huh?

05:45.109 --> 05:49.133
Pinocchio?! Son?! Alive?!

05:49.242 --> 05:52.038
I don't believe my eyes!

05:52.109 --> 05:53.109
Oh...

05:54.409 --> 05:56.568
Alive!

06:01.242 --> 06:03.174
I'm a boy and I'm alive!

06:11.109 --> 06:13.438
Lyusilda...

06:22.875 --> 06:25.637
And what do you think
will come of all this?

06:25.742 --> 06:27.606
Trust me, caro.

06:27.675 --> 06:32.904
At least this will make for an extremely
interesting story.

06:32.975 --> 06:34.169
Hup.

07:17.708 --> 07:19.572
Hup! Hup! Ha!

07:24.608 --> 07:27.540
Hi... yah!

07:27.608 --> 07:28.938
Good job, tibalt!

07:29.942 --> 07:31.567
Hit it again!

07:32.575 --> 07:35.235
Now let's try it like this.
Hup! Hup! Hup!

07:35.309 --> 07:37.275
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

07:48.109 --> 07:49.541
Ah!

07:53.375 --> 07:56.307
Pinocchio! Son!

08:01.308 --> 08:03.798
Yee-haw! Ta-da!

08:03.908 --> 08:06.931
Be careful! Don't hurt yourself!

08:07.009 --> 08:09.135
Dad, don't worry, I can't hurt myself.

08:09.242 --> 08:12.140
You told me I was made
of high-quality materials.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.799
Yes, but...

08:13.908 --> 08:16.704
Don't you worry, <i>signore</i> geppetto!

08:16.775 --> 08:19.434
I've got everything under control.

08:23.708 --> 08:26.198
And that is what I'm afraid of, tibalt.

08:31.475 --> 08:35.408
Greetings, my good gentlemen.
My name is geppetto.

08:35.475 --> 08:37.567
May I ask who I am speaking with today?

08:37.642 --> 08:40.166
I am brioni, detective constable.

08:40.275 --> 08:44.004
Have you seen anyone
suspicious around here lately?

08:45.109 --> 08:49.064
No one but you,
detective brioni.

08:49.142 --> 08:52.506
It's not a joke!
It's a very serious matter.

08:52.608 --> 08:54.404
We are looking for tough criminals!

08:54.475 --> 08:55.305
Hmm?

08:55.408 --> 08:59.103
I assure you, there is no one
here like that.

08:59.175 --> 09:02.903
And you don't find
that little fact suspicious?

09:02.975 --> 09:04.805
What little fact?

09:04.908 --> 09:08.966
You don't think it's suspicious that
there's no one suspicious in your home?

09:11.642 --> 09:14.768
Absolutely not, detective.

09:14.875 --> 09:18.933
In that case, you won't mind
if we see for ourselves.

09:21.608 --> 09:24.870
- Let's start with the stables.
- Detective, please wait...

09:24.942 --> 09:27.874
Excuse me, but it is <i>your</i> job to wait,

09:27.942 --> 09:31.102
and <i>my</i> job is to investigate! Yes!

09:32.575 --> 09:34.598
And that's exactly what I'll do.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.507
Did you hear that?

09:38.608 --> 09:39.836
Follow me!

09:49.908 --> 09:52.897
Pinocchio! Tibalt!

09:53.908 --> 09:55.271
Are you here?

10:04.142 --> 10:07.938
Whew! That was really close!

10:08.042 --> 10:11.406
I was sure that detective
was about to find you!

10:11.475 --> 10:13.703
It's okay, dad, don't worry.

10:13.775 --> 10:17.730
Even if they find me, I can always pretend
to be a tree stump.

10:19.575 --> 10:23.303
Father, tell me, when can I leave
to be on my own?

10:23.408 --> 10:26.204
I've got the whole world to see.

10:26.275 --> 10:28.640
I want to meet other people.

10:28.742 --> 10:31.731
Not any time soon, Pinocchio.

10:31.808 --> 10:34.934
You're too unusual for this world.

10:35.009 --> 10:39.339
If I were in your boots,
I'd use the word "special" instead.

10:39.441 --> 10:41.999
Yes, thank you, tibalt.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.837
He's right.
You are too special, Pinocchio.

10:45.942 --> 10:49.068
You're too young and too gullible.

10:49.141 --> 10:52.472
The world is full of people
who could harm you.

10:52.575 --> 10:56.132
I promise I will let you go.
Believe me, son.

10:56.241 --> 10:58.264
But only when the time is right.

10:59.675 --> 11:01.767
Time sure takes its sweet time.

11:01.842 --> 11:05.172
Maybe time just got lost on its way here.

11:08.875 --> 11:11.773
Come on, tibalt! Let's see what it was!

11:16.042 --> 11:18.906
Pinocchio, wait!

11:33.108 --> 11:36.200
Stop it, I say!
Enough with the shooting already!

11:36.275 --> 11:38.435
We have important matters to discuss!

11:38.508 --> 11:42.236
Our last few shows
barely had any audience.

11:42.308 --> 11:45.605
I say we just need
to come up with a new act.

11:45.675 --> 11:49.266
Well, I'm open for suggestions! Heh!

11:49.341 --> 11:52.797
All right. Here's an idea.

11:52.908 --> 11:56.272
We'll turn off all the lights,
and I'll crawl between the seats,

11:56.341 --> 11:59.603
grabbing the audience by their feet.

11:59.675 --> 12:02.642
Nonsense! That won't do.

12:02.742 --> 12:04.504
It will just scare everyone off.

12:04.608 --> 12:07.939
How about this?
I will shoot the audience,

12:08.009 --> 12:12.202
and the fox will be catching the bullets
with his teeth. Huh?

12:12.275 --> 12:13.366
What?

12:13.441 --> 12:16.203
I will shoot blanks, of course,

12:16.275 --> 12:18.537
and you will hold bullets in your mouth.

12:18.608 --> 12:21.404
No! What if I choke on one of the bullets?

12:22.475 --> 12:27.271
Come on! Do you seriously think
someone is willing to pay to be shot at?

12:27.375 --> 12:29.774
Well, you asked for suggestions!

12:29.875 --> 12:30.898
Meow!

12:45.441 --> 12:46.771
Huh?

12:52.742 --> 12:55.003
- Stop them!
- Bella, where are you going?!

12:55.108 --> 12:58.131
- Yes, Bella, where are you going?
- Save my daughter!

13:07.475 --> 13:11.430
Why does my father want me
to stay home all the time, tibalt?

13:11.541 --> 13:14.405
He's just worried about you, my boy.

13:14.475 --> 13:17.737
You can't deny you really are special.

13:17.808 --> 13:20.934
Besides, the police
have been sniffing around lately.

13:21.942 --> 13:24.203
Yeah, you're probably right.

13:24.275 --> 13:26.640
But, you know, what about my dream?

13:26.742 --> 13:29.640
- You have a dream?
- Yes, tibalt!

13:29.742 --> 13:33.038
I have a special, most treasured dream!

13:33.108 --> 13:34.939
Huh?!

13:35.041 --> 13:36.530
- Oh?
- Wait!

13:36.608 --> 13:38.074
Go on! Go on!

13:39.541 --> 13:42.007
Wait, Bella! Stop!

13:47.675 --> 13:50.164
The coach is headed for the cliff!
She's gonna fall!

13:50.275 --> 13:53.902
Pinocchio, it's not our problem.

13:53.974 --> 13:55.997
But we at least have to try saving her!

13:56.108 --> 13:57.768
Go!

14:02.941 --> 14:04.930
Jump, Bella! Jump!

14:05.008 --> 14:07.407
Jump! Don't worry!

14:07.475 --> 14:08.669
Jump off the carriage!

14:09.675 --> 14:11.402
Don't jump, Bella!

14:11.475 --> 14:14.964
You can break your leg
and you won't be able to perform!

14:15.074 --> 14:17.131
- Ow!
- Oh!

14:17.241 --> 14:19.105
So do I jump or not?

14:23.141 --> 14:25.039
Hold on, Bella!

14:31.441 --> 14:32.874
<i>Signorina!</i>

14:35.408 --> 14:37.204
<i>Signorina,</i> I'm here to help!

14:37.275 --> 14:38.867
Hmm?

14:41.308 --> 14:42.741
Alley-oop!

14:46.508 --> 14:48.304
Come on, we need to turn left!

14:50.341 --> 14:51.898
That's it!

14:53.742 --> 14:55.084
Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa! I got you!

14:55.108 --> 14:56.597
- Whoa!
- Good horsey!

14:56.675 --> 14:57.835
Horsey, go left! Go left!

14:57.941 --> 14:58.941
Whoa, ho, ho!

14:58.974 --> 15:01.066
Close call! Close call!

15:03.141 --> 15:06.438
Stop! Time to stop!

15:10.475 --> 15:12.441
<i>Signorina!</i>

15:12.508 --> 15:13.838
Are you okay there?

15:13.941 --> 15:17.965
I am, thanks to you! I'm Bella.

15:18.074 --> 15:20.904
And may I know the name of my savior?

15:20.974 --> 15:23.634
My name is Pinocchio.

15:23.742 --> 15:25.469
Huh?

15:28.441 --> 15:30.533
Bella, I don't get it.

15:30.608 --> 15:32.768
Have you been rescued without us?

15:33.775 --> 15:35.298
My greetings, sir.

15:36.375 --> 15:39.364
<i>Mamma Mia!</i> A wooden boy!

15:42.375 --> 15:44.898
Pinocchio!

15:44.974 --> 15:47.838
What have you done? You killed him!

15:49.308 --> 15:52.400
Pinocchio, are you all right?!

15:52.475 --> 15:55.169
I, uh... I think I'm okay.

15:56.408 --> 15:59.067
What are you shooting at, furbrains?!

15:59.141 --> 16:03.665
He's a talking wooden puppet!
He's a monster!

16:06.475 --> 16:09.737
Well, my friend might be made of wood,

16:09.807 --> 16:12.775
but someone here has sausages for brains.

16:12.841 --> 16:16.604
And that leaves one question...
Who's the real monster here?!

16:17.608 --> 16:21.268
What? I thought... I heard shots!

16:21.375 --> 16:23.432
How come?!

16:23.541 --> 16:27.973
Father, this noble young man here
saved my life.

16:33.074 --> 16:36.439
Well, in that case,
I think you deserve a...

16:38.408 --> 16:41.306
I can't believe my eyes!
Are you...

16:42.907 --> 16:46.568
You... made of wood?

16:46.642 --> 16:49.472
Here we go! Huh!

16:49.575 --> 16:53.803
First they shoot him, and now they knock
on him like he's a door.

16:53.907 --> 16:55.237
Here's an idea, sir.

16:55.308 --> 16:59.241
Why don't you do us all a favor
and keep those hands of yours to yourself?

16:59.308 --> 17:01.797
<i>Bellissimo!</i>

17:01.907 --> 17:05.670
- Guys, I really need this one.
- But what for, boss?

17:05.774 --> 17:07.172
Yeah, what for?

17:07.275 --> 17:10.435
Have you seen him ride that horse?
No reins at all!

17:10.508 --> 17:13.338
And he's made of wood! Fantastic!

17:13.441 --> 17:17.839
He is exactly what we need!
People will swarm to our circus!

17:17.941 --> 17:21.533
Pinocchio, they call me
<i>signore</i> mangiafuoco.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.404
But for you, just papa giafo.

17:24.475 --> 17:29.067
Have you ever thought about...
Hmm... joining a circus?

17:29.141 --> 17:30.937
A circus?

17:31.041 --> 17:34.099
Yes! You seem like a talented rider.

17:34.208 --> 17:37.731
You were born to be
shining in the arena! Ha!

17:37.807 --> 17:41.762
You will become a star, my boy!
Everyone will know your name.

17:41.874 --> 17:45.535
You will travel the world!

17:45.608 --> 17:48.733
- What?
- Thank you, but we're not interested.

17:48.807 --> 17:51.899
Please excuse us, we need to get going.

17:51.974 --> 17:52.804
Hmm...

17:52.907 --> 17:54.999
Hmm!

17:55.108 --> 17:57.302
Of course you will be a star,

17:57.408 --> 18:00.965
because you already have
such a marvelous talent agent!

18:01.074 --> 18:03.234
Um... <i>Signore...</i>

18:03.308 --> 18:05.297
The name's tibalt...

18:05.408 --> 18:10.170
Hmm... <i>Signore</i> tibalt, the talent agent.

18:11.841 --> 18:15.297
Actually, it does have a nice ring to it.

18:15.408 --> 18:19.840
You know...
Maybe it's not such a bad idea after all!

18:19.941 --> 18:24.238
<i>Signore</i> mangiafuoco,
thank you so much for the generous offer,

18:24.308 --> 18:27.206
but well, I'm sorry, I have to talk
to my father first.

18:27.275 --> 18:29.264
His-his name is geppetto.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.739
Well... of course you do.

18:31.807 --> 18:34.103
Go ahead and talk to him.

18:34.208 --> 18:37.368
But hurry. Fortune, my friend,
waits around for no one.

18:38.707 --> 18:41.106
I promise I'll be back in no time!

18:41.208 --> 18:43.970
Let's hurry home, tibalt!
We have to talk to father.

18:49.141 --> 18:51.800
Pinocchio, I'll be waiting!

19:00.841 --> 19:05.104
Dad, you have to let me go! Please!

19:05.174 --> 19:06.607
I'll go to the city,

19:06.674 --> 19:09.663
I'll do one performance,
and I'll be back home.

19:09.774 --> 19:13.900
Yes! And I promise I'll be there
to look after him at all times.

19:13.974 --> 19:16.566
And before you know it,
we'll be there and back.

19:16.641 --> 19:19.438
Dad, I can make a lot of money.

19:19.508 --> 19:23.304
We will build a new house!
At least a new workshop for you!

19:23.408 --> 19:25.897
I don't need money.

19:25.974 --> 19:28.202
I just need you, Pinocchio.

19:37.541 --> 19:42.098
Well, your own home
should never feel like a prison.

19:42.208 --> 19:43.867
You can go.

19:43.941 --> 19:46.930
Thank you, daddy! I knew
you wouldn't say no.

19:48.208 --> 19:51.402
Let's go, tibalt! Great adventures await!

19:55.641 --> 19:58.630
See you later, my dear geppetto!

19:58.741 --> 20:01.401
Just be careful, my son!

20:01.475 --> 20:04.771
Bye, daddy! Bye-bye!

20:17.308 --> 20:20.740
It looks like a carriage went by here.

20:20.807 --> 20:22.796
Several carriages, in fact.

20:22.907 --> 20:26.306
This is very suspicious.
Where did they go?

20:26.408 --> 20:29.397
This way? Or maybe that way?

20:30.541 --> 20:32.439
We don't know, detective brioni.

20:32.541 --> 20:35.598
Of course you don't know, knuckleheads!

20:35.707 --> 20:37.730
You've stomped all over the tracks!

20:37.807 --> 20:39.399
You both are no use at all!

20:39.475 --> 20:42.464
I always have to do everything myself!

20:48.108 --> 20:51.768
Okay, maybe I should toss a coin.
That's always worked.

20:56.974 --> 20:58.906
Hmm... heads.

20:58.974 --> 21:02.100
So this means the suspects
must have gone...

21:03.308 --> 21:04.933
That way! Follow me!

21:18.741 --> 21:21.333
Welcome! Welcome to our town!

21:27.641 --> 21:30.233
Circus! Circus is here!

21:32.208 --> 21:34.470
- What do you think?
- Amazing!

21:34.574 --> 21:37.064
I just love it here so much!

21:37.141 --> 21:39.800
You haven't seen anything yet, Pinocchio.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.305
Tonight, I promise you,

21:41.408 --> 21:44.863
you will be a witness to something
truly marvelous,

21:44.941 --> 21:47.566
something you won't soon forget.

21:54.974 --> 21:55.804
Alley-oop!

21:55.907 --> 21:59.601
<i>Signori</i> and <i>signorinas!</i>
Ladies and gentlemen!

21:59.707 --> 22:03.503
Tonight, we present to you
a never-before-seen,

22:03.607 --> 22:05.835
one-of-a-kind performance!

22:05.941 --> 22:07.998
If it's anything like last year,

22:08.108 --> 22:10.097
- I want my money back!
- Just awful!

22:12.074 --> 22:14.631
But first, right in front of you,

22:14.741 --> 22:18.970
our marksman will shoot
an apple off my head!

22:20.774 --> 22:23.173
This is not for the faint-hearted!

22:23.275 --> 22:25.002
Drumroll, please?

22:40.275 --> 22:41.275
Oops.

22:41.308 --> 22:45.400
As you can see, the first attempt failed.

22:45.474 --> 22:47.600
Let's try this!

22:56.241 --> 23:00.140
Well, no apple is a match
for this marksman!

23:00.241 --> 23:03.832
I want my money back!
I've seen this before!

23:15.641 --> 23:18.006
People are unhappy!

23:18.108 --> 23:20.131
We have to fix this immediately.

23:20.241 --> 23:22.400
Pinocchio, get ready! You're up next!

23:23.574 --> 23:24.631
I am?

23:24.741 --> 23:27.174
Yes! And hurry up!

23:27.275 --> 23:30.832
And you two,
make yourselves useful for once.

23:34.707 --> 23:37.197
Ladies and gentlemen!

23:37.275 --> 23:40.866
Please allow me to present to you

23:40.941 --> 23:44.464
the discovery of the season!

23:44.574 --> 23:48.939
The world's one and only,
unique talking puppet!

23:49.041 --> 23:52.735
Pinocchio!

23:52.807 --> 23:55.035
And his horse,

23:55.108 --> 23:58.369
tibalt!

24:04.308 --> 24:06.070
Show us what you've got!

24:12.507 --> 24:13.735
Come on!

24:14.841 --> 24:16.432
Okay, come on, come on.

24:17.841 --> 24:19.967
- Show us what you've got, come on!
- Come on!

24:22.074 --> 24:25.597
This wooden oaf will ruin
our whole performance.

24:25.674 --> 24:30.130
If he doesn't start doing something,
I'll kick him out of my circus!

24:31.674 --> 24:34.107
I know you can do it.

24:34.174 --> 24:36.469
What is that blockhead doing?

24:36.574 --> 24:38.438
How much longer do we have to wait?!

24:38.540 --> 24:42.871
Pinocchio, I think
it's time to start our act.

24:46.807 --> 24:49.296
- Entertain us!
- Come on!

24:49.407 --> 24:52.635
Pinocchio...

24:52.741 --> 24:54.935
- Pinocchio!
- Yeah?

24:55.041 --> 24:57.769
It's time, you're right.

25:40.607 --> 25:44.233
He did it! It's my success!

25:45.807 --> 25:48.637
Bella, go upstairs
and start getting ready.

25:48.741 --> 25:49.741
Mm-hmm.

25:50.974 --> 25:52.565
Bravo!

25:52.641 --> 25:55.471
Woo-hoo!

25:57.540 --> 25:59.200
Well done, boy!

26:02.440 --> 26:04.930
Bravo! <i>Bravissimo!</i>

26:05.041 --> 26:07.530
Fantozzi, you're up next.

26:07.607 --> 26:10.097
And this time,
try not to keep them waiting!

26:10.174 --> 26:14.629
My boy! Let me tell you,
you outdid yourself!

26:14.741 --> 26:17.605
Congratulations and welcome to our gang...

26:17.674 --> 26:19.800
Oh, excuse me, I mean,

26:19.907 --> 26:22.999
welcome to papa giafo's circus troupe.

26:23.108 --> 26:24.335
<i>Signore</i> tibalt,

26:24.440 --> 26:28.964
I think now it's about time
we discuss our contract terms.

26:29.074 --> 26:31.733
Mm, yes, I would think so.

26:31.807 --> 26:33.899
What time frame are we talking about?

26:33.974 --> 26:36.804
Pinocchio promised his father
that he'll be home soon.

26:36.907 --> 26:39.635
Why don't we do, uh, the road tour first?

26:39.741 --> 26:41.605
And we'll see how it goes.

26:41.707 --> 26:43.799
But now, please excuse me.

26:43.907 --> 26:46.566
I have to announce our next performer.

26:48.607 --> 26:52.597
Ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys,

26:52.707 --> 26:53.935
I present to you...

26:54.041 --> 26:55.200
- Tibalt...
- Fantozzi!

26:55.274 --> 26:59.071
I promise we'll go back to my father
as soon as we see the world

26:59.141 --> 27:01.197
and we make some money at least.

27:01.274 --> 27:03.764
But for now, since you're my talent agent,

27:03.874 --> 27:06.306
you can take his place.

27:06.407 --> 27:08.931
What? You want me to be your father?

27:09.041 --> 27:12.405
Well, this is somewhat unexpected.

27:12.474 --> 27:14.668
To be honest, Pinocchio,

27:14.774 --> 27:18.570
I never thought of our relationship
as a father-son dynamic.

27:18.641 --> 27:22.471
And besides, I'm too young
to be a parent, so to say.

27:22.574 --> 27:25.939
Just say yes.
I promise I'll be a good son.

27:26.008 --> 27:29.838
Well, all right. Let's say I do agree.

27:29.941 --> 27:33.339
- But there will be conditions.
- Name them.

27:33.440 --> 27:36.839
- You'll do everything exactly as I say.
- That's fair.

27:36.941 --> 27:40.999
- I have to know where you are 24/7.
- Consider it done.

27:41.108 --> 27:44.404
And if you're bad, you'll be grounded
till I say otherwise.

27:44.474 --> 27:47.372
Ha! Yeah, right. In your dreams!

27:48.974 --> 27:51.633
But how else am I supposed
to teach you things?

27:51.741 --> 27:54.037
Well, how do I know?

27:54.107 --> 27:56.403
It's you that's the parent, not me.

27:56.474 --> 27:59.964
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

28:00.074 --> 28:05.700
please give it up for the ultimate
crown Jewel of our troupe!

28:05.774 --> 28:09.297
She's delightful, she's fascinating,

28:09.407 --> 28:12.033
performer extraordinaire...

28:12.107 --> 28:14.130
Bella!

28:17.607 --> 28:19.164
Bella!

28:19.274 --> 28:22.003
- Bella!
- Bella!

30:36.407 --> 30:38.931
Amazing! You were out of this world!

30:39.007 --> 30:41.497
Your song was so beautiful, Bella.

30:41.607 --> 30:44.096
And you were so brave!

30:44.173 --> 30:48.072
You're too kind. I'm actually not brave
at all, I just practice a lot.

30:48.140 --> 30:50.573
But you!
You were sensational out there.

30:50.641 --> 30:52.607
Oh, you really think so?

30:52.707 --> 30:55.901
Of course I do! You'll be a star
some day, no doubt!

30:55.973 --> 30:58.030
Bella! Pinocchio!

30:58.107 --> 31:01.540
Do you hear that? They're calling for us.

31:01.607 --> 31:04.130
Bella! Pinocchio!

31:10.474 --> 31:11.804
Pinocchio!

32:11.906 --> 32:13.532
Well, well, well.

32:13.607 --> 32:18.199
Something tells me that I might have seen
this poster before.

32:18.274 --> 32:20.536
You sure have, detective.

32:20.607 --> 32:23.335
This is mangiafuoco's traveling circus.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.997
Yeah, they're touring
small towns and villages.

32:26.107 --> 32:27.834
They came here yesterday.

32:27.940 --> 32:30.907
Hmm... interesting.

32:30.973 --> 32:33.099
Something to think about.

32:33.173 --> 32:36.003
Do you know
what any detective's first job is?

32:36.107 --> 32:38.597
What, detective?

32:38.674 --> 32:41.663
You knuckleheads! A detective's
first job is to think!

32:41.774 --> 32:43.672
Hmm.

32:43.774 --> 32:48.104
I wonder where they're going next?

32:48.173 --> 32:49.900
Hmm? Mm...

33:05.240 --> 33:10.105
<i>♪ She rules the night sky ♪</i>

33:34.007 --> 33:37.065
Well, well. I should have known.

33:37.140 --> 33:40.834
It's all about your precious Bella,
isn't it?

33:40.940 --> 33:43.669
She is the real reason you left your home,

33:43.773 --> 33:47.104
and it has nothing to do with
seeing the world.

33:47.173 --> 33:48.571
No, tibalt, you're wrong!

33:48.641 --> 33:53.130
I mean, well, you're not exactly right.
I did want to see the world.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.831
But as soon as I met her,

33:54.940 --> 34:00.635
I realized she is the most beautiful thing
the world has to offer.

34:07.207 --> 34:09.230
Hmm... alrighty, then.

34:09.307 --> 34:11.399
So what do you intend to do about it?

34:11.474 --> 34:13.406
What do you mean? What can I do?

34:13.474 --> 34:15.600
I mean, you have to do something.

34:15.707 --> 34:17.571
Give her some flowers,

34:17.641 --> 34:20.699
or invite her for a walk on the beach.

34:20.773 --> 34:23.570
Just look how beautiful it is out there.

34:23.641 --> 34:26.902
The moon and the stars,
twinkling in the water.

34:26.973 --> 34:29.099
Boats rolling gently by the shore.

34:29.173 --> 34:33.128
And all the cafés are closed,
so you won't have to buy her ice cream.

34:33.240 --> 34:36.332
You have no reason
to be afraid, Pinocchio!

34:36.440 --> 34:38.963
Trust me, it's better
to regret things you've done

34:39.073 --> 34:41.767
than regret things you've never tried.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.966
Really? I don't want to cross any lines.

34:45.073 --> 34:48.005
But what happens if she says no to me?

34:48.107 --> 34:52.631
Either you go and talk to her,
or we go back home.

34:52.740 --> 34:56.401
I'm not going to spend my life
waiting for you to make up your mind.

35:03.107 --> 35:06.733
All right... I'll go. It's just...

35:06.806 --> 35:10.637
Quit your whining!
You'd better listen to your father.

35:44.640 --> 35:47.403
Pinocchio is a godsend!

35:47.474 --> 35:51.906
With this puppet in our circus,
we can finally score big!

35:51.973 --> 35:56.338
Tomorrow night, our show will be sold out!

35:56.440 --> 36:01.032
The whole town will want
to come and see our performers!

36:01.107 --> 36:05.472
And of course, your job is?

36:05.574 --> 36:08.938
Not to spoil everything!

36:09.040 --> 36:12.405
N-N-No worries, boss.
You can count on both of us.

36:12.474 --> 36:15.133
What if he leaves and goes back home?

36:15.240 --> 36:16.763
Don't worry, he won't.

36:16.873 --> 36:21.534
Apparently, he has a crush on Bella,
so he's not going anywhere.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.800
Who's there?

36:43.173 --> 36:44.401
It's just me.

36:44.474 --> 36:48.134
Pinocchio, you need to listen to me.
I have to tell you something.

36:48.240 --> 36:51.434
I'm here to tell you something too.

36:51.507 --> 36:53.337
Let me go first, Pinocchio.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.667
You're a great guy, that's true.

36:55.773 --> 36:59.001
But it's better if you leave
before something terrible happens!

36:59.107 --> 37:00.800
You want me to leave the circus?

37:00.906 --> 37:03.565
Trust me, it will be better this way.

37:03.640 --> 37:05.970
You have to leave as soon as possible!

37:06.073 --> 37:07.766
- But...
- No buts!

37:07.873 --> 37:10.601
Get out! Leave!
I don't even like you!

37:32.740 --> 37:34.570
Oh, flowers.

37:35.573 --> 37:38.006
Who are those for, I wonder?

37:39.640 --> 37:41.766
I might have some insight.

37:41.840 --> 37:46.433
It looks like our wooden Romeo here
is in love with Bella.

37:46.507 --> 37:48.996
That's hilarious!

37:49.107 --> 37:51.630
What? Hold on, fellow.

37:53.240 --> 37:56.400
That's the funniest thing I heard today!

37:56.474 --> 38:00.599
Did you seriously think
that you and Bella...?

38:05.806 --> 38:10.262
Oh... time for a reality check, Pinocchio.

38:10.374 --> 38:12.863
That's what friends are for, right?

38:12.940 --> 38:15.430
Bella is the boss's daughter.

38:15.539 --> 38:19.370
It won't be long before she becomes
a beautiful young <i>signorina.</i>

38:19.440 --> 38:21.236
And you, my friend,

38:21.307 --> 38:25.899
will always be nothing
but a wooden puppet.

38:25.973 --> 38:28.598
A special <i>talking</i> puppet...

38:28.706 --> 38:31.900
But a puppet nonetheless.

39:10.274 --> 39:13.570
<i>Tibalt, faster!</i>

39:13.640 --> 39:16.436
<i>- Woo-hoo-hoo!</i>
- Oh! Oh!

39:20.539 --> 39:23.471
<i>Yipee!</i>

39:23.573 --> 39:26.540
Pinocchio!

39:26.606 --> 39:29.470
<i>Yep! Giddyup, giddyup,
giddyup, giddyup!</i>

39:36.274 --> 39:39.831
I should never have let him go by himself.

39:39.940 --> 39:42.429
But he said it was his dream!

39:44.140 --> 39:45.572
Well...

39:45.640 --> 39:50.732
It's time for me to stop sitting around
and go find my boy!

39:50.806 --> 39:54.432
Wherever you are, Pinocchio,
I hope you're all right.

40:07.173 --> 40:09.299
Pinocchio?

40:11.107 --> 40:12.107
Hmm?

40:13.873 --> 40:16.067
Is something wrong?

40:16.140 --> 40:18.868
You told me I should ask Bella out.

40:18.940 --> 40:22.770
Well, I did, and you know
what answer she gave me?

40:22.873 --> 40:24.135
What?

40:24.240 --> 40:25.399
Get out!

40:26.573 --> 40:28.267
Well, so what?

40:28.373 --> 40:30.772
You have to learn
to take no for an answer.

40:30.873 --> 40:34.067
Not a big deal.
It's a normal part of life.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.799
Normal, you said?

40:35.906 --> 40:38.736
You want to see something
that's far from normal?

40:38.806 --> 40:42.568
Look carefully and tell me
what you see, tibalt.

40:44.007 --> 40:46.405
What do I see?

40:46.473 --> 40:50.236
I see you. And myself.

40:50.307 --> 40:53.398
Tibalt, I'm a puppet!

40:53.473 --> 40:56.804
The wooden log! I'm a freak!

40:56.906 --> 40:59.395
What do you expect me to say?

40:59.473 --> 41:03.463
Well, you've always seemed
quite normal to me, Pinocchio.

41:04.640 --> 41:08.664
Yes, you're made of wood,
but that's what makes you unique.

41:08.773 --> 41:11.933
Don't you see?
There's no one else like you!

41:12.007 --> 41:14.473
I don't want to be one of a kind!

41:14.573 --> 41:17.063
I want to be like everyone else.

41:19.040 --> 41:21.802
But I guess I'm just doomed
to be a wooden puppet...

41:22.806 --> 41:25.068
For the rest of my dumb life.

41:25.140 --> 41:29.868
Excuse me,
but that's not necessarily true.

41:29.940 --> 41:33.804
I know who might be able
to help you, Pinocchio.

41:35.306 --> 41:37.602
One of the clowns I know

41:37.706 --> 41:41.196
was told by another clown

41:41.273 --> 41:43.638
that there is a fairy

41:43.740 --> 41:47.900
who lives by a mountain
over the faraway woods.

41:47.973 --> 41:49.905
Her name is lyusilda,

41:49.973 --> 41:52.302
and she's been living a secluded life

41:52.406 --> 41:57.931
as she grew tired of people
who only seek love and wealth.

42:01.273 --> 42:06.399
It's been said
that she has very powerful magic.

42:06.473 --> 42:09.906
I'm sure she could turn you
into a real boy.

42:13.673 --> 42:16.197
But be warned, Pinocchio...

42:16.273 --> 42:19.467
They say the mountain pass
that leads to her house

42:19.573 --> 42:23.972
is believed to be by evil spirits.

42:27.773 --> 42:32.138
What? Evil spirits? No way!

42:32.239 --> 42:34.206
I can't stand spirits, ghosts,

42:34.273 --> 42:37.638
and other, you know, dead things.

42:37.740 --> 42:41.969
You realize I have to find that fairy!
Whatever it takes!

42:42.073 --> 42:46.437
Wait! We can't leave.
Everyone here is counting on us.

42:46.506 --> 42:48.996
We'll be back in time for the show.

42:49.107 --> 42:52.232
But-but-but, what if we need money
on our way there?

42:52.306 --> 42:54.636
We have five gold coins, remember?

42:55.973 --> 42:58.302
So, one clown said something,

42:58.406 --> 43:01.169
and then another one said something,

43:01.273 --> 43:05.570
but the real clown here is you, Pinocchio,
because you believed them!

43:05.640 --> 43:09.334
Whatever! I'll just go by myself!

43:11.906 --> 43:14.804
Pinocchio, where are you going?!

43:18.606 --> 43:23.062
Pinocchio! Wait for me,
you stubborn boy.

43:23.140 --> 43:25.367
Hey! What?!

43:25.439 --> 43:28.099
Shh! Five gold coins.

43:28.206 --> 43:31.400
He has five gold coins, old furball.

43:31.473 --> 43:33.803
But shouldn't we stop them?

43:33.906 --> 43:37.736
No, buddy boy, we really shouldn't.

43:37.806 --> 43:41.295
All right, we can catch up
with them later.

43:41.406 --> 43:45.033
- And then I will...
- No.

43:45.107 --> 43:49.403
He is set on finding lyusilda, right?

43:49.473 --> 43:50.962
Why don't we help him?

44:07.673 --> 44:10.731
Pinocchio? I don't like it here one bit.

44:11.740 --> 44:13.900
Are you sure we didn't get lost?

44:14.906 --> 44:16.167
Not really.

44:16.273 --> 44:18.933
The clown said lyusilda
lived by a mountain.

44:19.040 --> 44:21.734
But that's the only mountain around here.

44:25.239 --> 44:28.638
Oh, <i>Madonna!</i> What did I
get myself into?

44:28.740 --> 44:32.104
Why couldn't I have just stayed home,
safe and sound?

44:32.206 --> 44:35.037
Over there. What do you think is in there?

44:39.239 --> 44:41.137
I don't know,

44:41.239 --> 44:43.638
and I'm not so sure I want to find out.

44:43.740 --> 44:46.138
Stop being such a coward!

44:46.239 --> 44:49.695
I am not a coward! I'm just cautious.

44:51.840 --> 44:53.636
Whoa!

45:00.106 --> 45:01.231
Ahem.

45:01.306 --> 45:04.273
Excuse me. We need a little help here.

45:04.339 --> 45:07.567
We're looking for a fairy.
Her name is lyusilda.

45:07.640 --> 45:11.436
Well, you've found her, young man.

45:11.506 --> 45:14.734
I am right here!

45:14.806 --> 45:18.000
Don't you think it's too odd
of a coincidence?

45:18.106 --> 45:20.505
Are you <i>signora</i> lyusilda?

45:21.539 --> 45:23.801
But I thought you lived by a mountain!

45:23.906 --> 45:26.032
I did, I did,

45:26.106 --> 45:30.903
but recently moved here,
my young wooden friend!

45:32.206 --> 45:34.730
Wait, how does she know that?

45:34.806 --> 45:37.773
I cannot see anything behind this curtain.

45:37.873 --> 45:39.202
Be quiet!

45:39.273 --> 45:42.433
<i>Signora,</i> I came here
to ask for your help.

45:42.539 --> 45:46.403
I know, I know.
You want to become a human.

45:47.406 --> 45:50.930
I can easily arrange that, Pinocchio.

45:51.039 --> 45:53.267
But I require a certain payment.

45:53.339 --> 45:56.101
Say...

45:56.172 --> 45:59.264
Five gold coins.

45:59.339 --> 46:03.000
Oh! That's exactly
how much I have! See?

46:03.106 --> 46:05.334
Hold on just a second there.

46:05.439 --> 46:08.963
First, I'd like to ask you
how do you know his name?

46:09.072 --> 46:11.801
If you don't like the offer,
you're free to go!

46:11.906 --> 46:13.633
Please excuse my friend!

46:13.740 --> 46:15.763
Here! Here's your money!

46:15.840 --> 46:17.670
I beg your pardon!

46:17.773 --> 46:21.637
How exactly will you perform
this transformation

46:21.740 --> 46:25.195
or whatever else you call
this mumbo jumbo?

46:26.273 --> 46:31.206
A good fairy like me
never reveals her secrets.

46:31.273 --> 46:32.933
Just give me the money,

46:33.039 --> 46:37.632
and tomorrow Pinocchio will be a real boy!

46:37.740 --> 46:41.070
My apologies, but just one more thing.

46:41.139 --> 46:43.196
What if we give you one coin,

46:43.273 --> 46:47.900
and tomorrow, after we make sure
that Pinocchio will actually...

46:47.972 --> 46:49.370
You loudmouth!

46:49.439 --> 46:52.201
- Just give us the money!
- Aha!

46:52.273 --> 46:56.502
I knew it! I knew there was
something fishy going on!

46:56.606 --> 47:00.232
Hyah! Ho! Ho!

47:03.906 --> 47:05.497
He almost caught us.

47:09.506 --> 47:12.495
So long, butterface!

47:15.673 --> 47:18.071
Whoa!

47:21.106 --> 47:24.073
<i>Santa Maria Madonna</i> on a bicycle!

47:24.139 --> 47:27.868
Why did you have to jump out like that?
You ruined everything!

47:28.873 --> 47:30.964
Meow! That stupid horse

47:31.072 --> 47:34.471
was starting to get on my nerves
with his annoying questions!

47:34.573 --> 47:37.369
Well, great job! We didn't get the money,

47:37.439 --> 47:40.633
the puppet is gone,
and what are we gonna tell mangiafuoco?

47:40.740 --> 47:42.103
Meow!

47:45.473 --> 47:47.905
Am I dying? I think I'm hit!

47:47.972 --> 47:49.234
Tibalt, stop!

47:49.306 --> 47:51.295
I am wounded!

47:51.406 --> 47:53.372
And I'm sure it's fatal!

47:53.439 --> 47:55.303
Could you just stop?

47:56.473 --> 47:59.098
I'm in so much pain!

47:59.172 --> 48:01.104
I'm bleeding!

48:01.172 --> 48:04.605
- Oh, no, I'm too young to die!
- Tibalt, I said, stop!

48:10.573 --> 48:14.335
Pinocchio, I can't look.

48:14.439 --> 48:17.770
Please, tell me,
is the bullet still there?

48:17.840 --> 48:19.806
The bullet didn't even graze you.

48:19.905 --> 48:22.963
- I mean...
- What? Are you sure?

48:23.072 --> 48:24.596
Yes, I'm sure.

48:24.673 --> 48:28.401
Well, can you look, just in case?

48:28.473 --> 48:31.531
I still think I was hit... maybe?

48:31.606 --> 48:34.197
No, tibalt, trust me, you're fine.

48:34.273 --> 48:37.262
- Why don't you just check yourself?
- Oh, yeah?

48:37.373 --> 48:39.601
This is just great.

48:39.706 --> 48:42.035
Look where your dream
got us, Pinocchio.

48:42.106 --> 48:43.197
Tibalt, quit it.

48:43.273 --> 48:46.535
You're the one who's invincible
to bullets, Pinocchio.

48:46.606 --> 48:50.936
But I would really like
to keep my behind from getting shot.

48:51.039 --> 48:54.529
Who were they and how did they
know your name?

48:54.606 --> 48:59.834
Another question is, how did they know
about the five gold coins?

49:02.306 --> 49:05.273
I don't know.
But for a little second there,

49:05.339 --> 49:08.135
it seemed to me as though
they sounded like the cat and the fox.

49:08.239 --> 49:11.103
Hmm... the cat and the fox!

49:11.172 --> 49:13.138
Well, that explains everything!

49:13.239 --> 49:16.570
I always knew those circus freaks
were up to no good!

49:16.640 --> 49:18.470
Enough already, tibalt!

49:18.573 --> 49:20.767
We still need to find lyusilda.

49:20.839 --> 49:22.772
Right!

49:22.839 --> 49:26.999
Well, I say one lyusilda
is more than enough for today.

49:29.273 --> 49:31.740
Oh... oh!

49:39.606 --> 49:43.061
This is the mountain.
It's right in front of us.

49:43.139 --> 49:44.901
Let's go!

50:01.206 --> 50:03.764
Pinocchio... Pinocchio!

50:03.839 --> 50:07.238
Wait, Pinocchio! Just wait a minute!

50:07.306 --> 50:09.432
What now?

50:09.506 --> 50:11.302
This is a bad idea.

50:11.406 --> 50:13.804
Or did you forget
about the evil spirits?

50:13.905 --> 50:16.270
If you're that scared, I'll go by myself!

50:17.905 --> 50:20.167
Huh? Uh?

50:20.273 --> 50:23.570
Who? Me?

50:23.640 --> 50:25.504
Scared?

50:25.606 --> 50:27.595
I am never scared!

50:27.673 --> 50:30.934
Brave tibalt is not afraid of anything!

50:31.006 --> 50:33.098
Let's go!

50:33.206 --> 50:34.229
Halt!

50:35.706 --> 50:36.796
Who are you?

50:38.039 --> 50:40.699
Why are you here?

50:40.772 --> 50:42.261
I knew it! That's them!

50:42.373 --> 50:44.362
That's the spirits! We're doomed!

50:46.406 --> 50:49.532
Dear evil spirits, please,
we mean you no harm.

50:49.606 --> 50:52.300
We're just looking
for a fairy named lyusilda.

50:52.406 --> 50:55.634
We want to ask her
for a teeny, teeny favor.

50:55.739 --> 50:59.536
There is no one
here by that name!

50:59.606 --> 51:02.095
Did you hear that, Pinocchio?

51:02.206 --> 51:04.138
We got the wrong place.

51:04.239 --> 51:07.467
Sorry! We apologize.
We were just leaving.

51:07.573 --> 51:10.471
And we promise never to come back.

51:10.573 --> 51:14.164
Pinocchio! We're leaving!

51:16.273 --> 51:18.296
I'm not going anywhere!

51:18.406 --> 51:20.963
Aren't you supposed
to be filling in as my father?

51:21.072 --> 51:24.732
Well...

51:24.805 --> 51:26.897
I guess... I am.

51:26.972 --> 51:28.734
Then act like a father!

51:28.805 --> 51:31.272
<i>You're</i> supposed
to teach <i>me</i> courage!

51:31.339 --> 51:35.703
That may be so,
but what if I don't feel like it?

51:37.872 --> 51:39.066
Ay...

51:39.139 --> 51:41.367
All right, fine.

51:41.439 --> 51:43.303
I can try.

51:43.406 --> 51:47.134
Hey, you! Come out and fight like a man!

51:49.539 --> 51:51.800
As you wish, horse!

51:51.905 --> 51:53.599
You asked for it.

51:53.705 --> 51:55.263
- Huh?!
- Huh?

51:58.739 --> 52:00.035
I changed my mind.

52:00.106 --> 52:03.562
You don't have to come out,
you're perfectly fine where you are.

52:05.273 --> 52:06.833
That's it. Pinocchio, we're going back.

52:06.939 --> 52:09.962
No! As my father, you should say,

52:10.072 --> 52:12.266
"don't give up, son! Never turn back!"

52:14.273 --> 52:15.273
Uh...

52:16.172 --> 52:17.172
Uh...

52:18.106 --> 52:20.902
Yeah! We're not afraid of you! Hop on.

52:20.972 --> 52:22.995
Let's go, tibalt! Go!

52:33.905 --> 52:35.565
Oh!

52:38.705 --> 52:42.468
So, as your father,
what am I supposed to say now?!

52:42.573 --> 52:46.437
You're supposed to say,
"there's no obstacle you cannot overcome!"

52:46.539 --> 52:48.198
You think?

52:48.273 --> 52:50.399
Okay, I'd rather not say anything.

52:50.473 --> 52:52.030
I'll just...

53:18.772 --> 53:21.000
That was awesome, tibalt!

53:21.106 --> 53:25.663
When we have our own circus,
you and I will jump through fire.

53:25.772 --> 53:27.568
Hmm?

53:29.972 --> 53:33.337
I'm losing my touch. Hmm.

53:33.439 --> 53:35.428
Must be getting old.

53:52.805 --> 53:54.272
Oh!

54:09.772 --> 54:13.636
Wow! It is so beautiful out here!

54:13.739 --> 54:17.070
I agree. It's truly magnificent.

54:21.306 --> 54:26.398
If you ask me, it certainly looks
like a suitable place for a fairy.

54:26.473 --> 54:31.167
And how may I help you,
my most welcome, unexpected visitors?

54:31.273 --> 54:33.602
Um... hello, <i>signora.</i>

54:33.672 --> 54:36.798
We're looking for a fairy
named lyusilda. Is that you?

54:36.905 --> 54:38.894
Yes, I sure am.

54:38.972 --> 54:41.631
So nice to meet you, <i>signora</i> lyusilda!

54:41.739 --> 54:46.366
My name is Pinocchio.
And this is my friend, tibalt.

54:46.439 --> 54:48.564
And I'm guessing you've noticed...

54:48.639 --> 54:50.628
I'm a wooden puppet.

54:50.739 --> 54:55.195
Pinocchio, of course I've noticed
that you are a puppet.

54:55.273 --> 54:59.069
I may even know who created you.

54:59.139 --> 55:00.764
Wonderful!

55:00.872 --> 55:03.430
In that case, let's get
straight to the point.

55:03.538 --> 55:08.596
We're not here for money, wealth,
and all that other nonsense.

55:08.705 --> 55:11.967
Moreover, we'll be happy
to pay for your services.

55:12.072 --> 55:14.595
Mm... a reasonable amount, of course.

55:16.939 --> 55:20.065
I'm sorry, you can't buy
my magic with money.

55:20.139 --> 55:21.162
Miracles...

55:22.172 --> 55:23.569
Are priceless.

55:23.639 --> 55:25.833
I have to admit,

55:25.939 --> 55:28.598
I agree with the pricing policy.

55:28.672 --> 55:32.105
Now, if you really are a fairy,
as you claim to be,

55:32.172 --> 55:36.764
it shouldn't be too hard
for you to perform a small miracle

55:36.839 --> 55:39.806
and turn our Pinocchio here
into a real boy.

55:43.006 --> 55:45.029
I'm sorry, my sweet boy.

55:45.106 --> 55:47.435
I'm afraid there is
nothing I can do to help.

55:49.872 --> 55:51.100
Let me ask you,

55:51.206 --> 55:54.195
how sure are you that you want
to become human?

55:55.905 --> 56:00.361
Sometimes, being human
is the hardest thing.

56:05.472 --> 56:07.962
Don't get discouraged just yet.

56:08.072 --> 56:11.130
If that is your dream
and something you truly want,

56:11.239 --> 56:12.602
remember this:

56:12.705 --> 56:14.728
The best miracles in this life

56:14.805 --> 56:19.295
always happen
without any help from us fairies.

56:19.405 --> 56:21.497
Oh, ho, ho! I see now.

56:21.605 --> 56:24.799
If you're not up to the task,
you could just say so.

56:24.905 --> 56:27.235
Time to head back, Pinocchio.

56:27.306 --> 56:31.602
On our way home, we still have, uh,
evil spirits to deal with.

56:33.505 --> 56:35.494
Well, it was nice meeting you.

56:47.572 --> 56:50.561
Good luck on your journey, Pinocchio.

56:53.139 --> 56:56.400
Why didn't you turn him into a boy?

56:56.472 --> 56:58.700
For you, that's easy-peasy.

56:58.772 --> 57:01.431
It's just not the right time yet, caro.

57:01.538 --> 57:04.561
Besides, there is a secret.

57:04.639 --> 57:08.629
If someone wants to be human,
all they have to do is be human.

57:08.739 --> 57:11.206
Hmm? Mm, that's deep.

57:11.273 --> 57:12.761
Mm...

57:12.872 --> 57:16.066
Sometimes I think you forget
I'm still a parrot.

57:16.139 --> 57:18.503
That went straight over my tuft.

57:22.639 --> 57:26.503
What do you mean,
he left looking for lyusilda?

57:26.605 --> 57:30.163
I will whip you to death! No!

57:30.273 --> 57:33.762
I'll kill you two with my bare hands!

57:33.839 --> 57:36.067
Boss, it's not our fault.

57:36.139 --> 57:39.003
It is not our fault, boss.

57:39.106 --> 57:43.470
It was Bella. You said it yourself,
that he is crazy about her.

57:43.572 --> 57:46.436
That's why he wants
to become a human.

57:47.839 --> 57:50.135
Do you even understand
what's happening?

57:50.239 --> 57:52.728
I might as well toss
my whole plan out the window!

57:52.805 --> 57:55.794
The whole show is already sold out!

57:55.905 --> 57:58.371
I don't see any reason to panic, boss.

57:58.438 --> 58:00.928
It's not as bad as you think it is.

58:01.039 --> 58:02.869
Not as bad, huh?!

58:02.939 --> 58:06.565
What if lyusilda <i>does</i> make him human?
What then?

58:06.639 --> 58:11.266
I don't need another human performer.
I need a talking puppet!

58:11.372 --> 58:13.771
That's who people want to see
when they come here!

58:15.139 --> 58:18.594
Hmm, do you really believe in magic, boss?

58:18.705 --> 58:22.138
He's a puppet and he'll always
be a puppet.

58:22.239 --> 58:23.830
That's right.

58:23.939 --> 58:29.599
Besides, we heard him say that he'll be
back in time for the performance.

58:29.672 --> 58:32.969
All we have to do now is wait.

58:47.739 --> 58:49.569
Pinocchio!

58:49.639 --> 58:52.072
Come on, buddy, don't get so upset.

58:52.139 --> 58:53.969
We'll find you another fairy, Pinocchio.

58:54.072 --> 58:56.401
This is the good thing
about the time we live in.

58:56.472 --> 58:59.404
You can't spit without hitting a fairy!

58:59.472 --> 59:00.961
Listen to me.

59:01.072 --> 59:04.130
As your father, I know
what's best for you!

59:04.238 --> 59:06.898
One, two. One, two. One, two.

59:06.972 --> 59:09.233
- One, two. One, two.
- Looks like they're coming here.

59:09.305 --> 59:12.034
- One, two. One, two.
- Quick! Hide, Pinocchio.

59:12.106 --> 59:15.561
One, two. One, two. Hurry up!

59:15.639 --> 59:18.129
We, detectives, lead the way!

59:18.238 --> 59:22.296
One, two. One, two. One, two.

59:22.405 --> 59:25.736
What's wrong with you?
Why are you dragging your feet?

59:25.805 --> 59:28.430
We're exhausted, detective.

59:28.505 --> 59:31.665
Yeah, because we don't
even know where we're going.

59:31.772 --> 59:35.137
We're following the trail.
Don't you two get it?

59:35.238 --> 59:36.329
No, sir!

59:36.438 --> 59:40.598
<i>Mamma Mia!</i> I've exposed a criminal gang

59:40.672 --> 59:42.798
operating under the guise of a circus!

59:42.905 --> 59:44.302
They sell out their shows,

59:44.405 --> 59:47.168
and while the whole town
watches their performance,

59:47.272 --> 59:50.171
they Rob people's homes!

59:50.272 --> 59:52.898
And do you know
who's behind it all?

59:52.972 --> 59:55.132
Who, detective brioni?

59:55.238 --> 59:59.535
Who's the main star of the show?
Pinocchio!

59:59.605 --> 1:00:02.435
He is the shrewd,
hardened criminal we're after.

1:00:02.538 --> 1:00:05.402
He might not get his own hands dirty
in the robberies,

1:00:05.472 --> 1:00:10.428
but it's his wooden hands
that pull all the strings.

1:00:10.538 --> 1:00:13.800
He's a brilliant criminal mastermind!

1:00:13.905 --> 1:00:17.269
And right now, we are following his trail.

1:00:18.305 --> 1:00:21.863
He was seen here last night
with his equine accomplice, tibalt.

1:00:21.939 --> 1:00:24.462
So no time to be standing around!

1:00:24.572 --> 1:00:28.903
One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two.

1:00:28.972 --> 1:00:32.905
One, two. One, two. One, two...

1:00:32.972 --> 1:00:35.064
- Did you hear that?
- I did.

1:00:35.138 --> 1:00:38.400
I get it now! We have to go back
to the circus!

1:00:38.472 --> 1:00:42.234
No, Pinocchio! I don't think
you get it at all!

1:00:42.305 --> 1:00:44.670
<i>We</i> are wanted by the police.

1:00:44.772 --> 1:00:47.500
They think <i>you</i> are a criminal mastermind,

1:00:47.605 --> 1:00:50.230
and <i>I</i> am your evil accomplice!

1:00:50.305 --> 1:00:53.932
We have to get out of here
as soon as we possibly can!

1:00:54.006 --> 1:00:57.131
Yes, but first I have to talk to Bella!

1:00:57.238 --> 1:00:58.966
Talk to her?

1:00:59.072 --> 1:01:01.595
She's just as guilty as her father is!

1:01:01.705 --> 1:01:03.364
Tibalt, don't you get it?

1:01:03.438 --> 1:01:06.098
I have to tell her that she's in danger!

1:01:06.205 --> 1:01:08.695
Pinocchio!

1:01:08.772 --> 1:01:11.898
Why don't you understand? This is life.

1:01:11.972 --> 1:01:14.563
Sometimes, your friends
are not your friends at all!

1:01:14.639 --> 1:01:17.401
Yes, tibalt,
you're a fine example of that!

1:01:17.472 --> 1:01:20.200
- What?!
- You heard me!

1:01:20.272 --> 1:01:23.899
Well, in that case,
if you want to spend your life in prison,

1:01:23.972 --> 1:01:25.961
go ahead. I'm out.

1:01:26.072 --> 1:01:28.902
That's fine with me! Leave, if you want!

1:01:28.972 --> 1:01:30.631
I don't need you anyway!

1:01:31.739 --> 1:01:35.070
- I <i>will</i> leave!
- Good riddance and good luck!

1:01:35.138 --> 1:01:39.628
Keep your luck to yourself! We both know
you'll need it more than I will!

1:02:12.905 --> 1:02:14.393
Hmm?

1:02:14.472 --> 1:02:16.302
Bella, Bella!

1:02:16.405 --> 1:02:20.235
My most beautiful, most loving child.

1:02:20.305 --> 1:02:22.397
You're not my real father!

1:02:22.472 --> 1:02:24.962
So that's how you talk to me?

1:02:25.071 --> 1:02:28.527
You're breaking my poor fragile heart.

1:02:28.605 --> 1:02:30.594
Let me ask you a question,
tell me the truth.

1:02:30.672 --> 1:02:32.934
You let that puppet
go just for one reason...

1:02:33.006 --> 1:02:34.768
To get back at me!

1:02:35.839 --> 1:02:37.635
That puppet has a name!

1:02:37.739 --> 1:02:42.171
Well, of course it has a name, Bella.

1:02:42.272 --> 1:02:45.001
But it's still a puppet. A wooden toy.

1:02:45.105 --> 1:02:47.800
At least he's not a thief or a fraud!

1:02:47.905 --> 1:02:49.268
Unlike you!

1:02:50.405 --> 1:02:54.395
Unlike <i>us.</i> Isn't that what you meant?

1:02:54.472 --> 1:02:57.302
Unlike <i>us,</i> my dear child.

1:02:57.405 --> 1:03:02.031
Don't forget that <i>you</i>
are an indispensable part

1:03:02.105 --> 1:03:06.197
of <i>our</i> little operation here.

1:03:06.272 --> 1:03:09.796
I knew nothing of your shady plans
with the cat and the fox!

1:03:09.905 --> 1:03:11.632
I believe you, child.

1:03:11.739 --> 1:03:17.228
But I doubt anyone else
will be as trusting as I am.

1:03:17.305 --> 1:03:19.601
So don't do anything stupid, girl.

1:03:23.705 --> 1:03:27.695
And when that talking puppet
decides to come back,

1:03:27.772 --> 1:03:30.864
do me a favor and be nice to it.

1:03:43.405 --> 1:03:46.303
That stubborn piece of wood!

1:03:46.405 --> 1:03:49.962
What was he going on about,
calling <i>me</i> his father?

1:03:50.071 --> 1:03:52.504
I have no business being your father!

1:03:52.605 --> 1:03:54.503
You know who your parents are?

1:03:54.605 --> 1:03:58.504
- Here they are, in these woods...
- An oak and a maple.

1:03:58.605 --> 1:04:01.663
No wonder you like hanging out
in the woods so much.

1:04:01.772 --> 1:04:05.864
You're as smart as a log, Pinocchio.
You never listen!

1:04:05.938 --> 1:04:11.064
And the best thing I could do for you
was leaving you alone!

1:04:15.938 --> 1:04:19.530
Did I really leave him alone?

1:04:19.605 --> 1:04:22.731
How could I?
He's my only friend in the world.

1:04:23.905 --> 1:04:27.633
What if something happens to him?
He's so fragile, after all.

1:04:27.739 --> 1:04:31.932
One could easily break him in half.
Or use him as firewood.

1:04:32.038 --> 1:04:33.129
Or maybe even...

1:04:33.238 --> 1:04:36.728
Turn him into a wooden mallet
or a door knocker!

1:04:38.005 --> 1:04:39.005
Oh...

1:04:39.839 --> 1:04:41.566
Pinocchio...

1:04:43.105 --> 1:04:45.663
I shouldn't have spoken
to tibalt like that.

1:04:45.772 --> 1:04:48.795
He's my friend, but I love Bella.

1:04:48.904 --> 1:04:50.564
Why do I have to choose?

1:04:51.904 --> 1:04:54.837
How do humans do it? It seems so hard.

1:04:54.938 --> 1:04:56.632
Lyusilda was right.

1:04:56.739 --> 1:04:58.728
I'm not up for something like that.

1:05:05.238 --> 1:05:07.261
Uh?

1:05:07.372 --> 1:05:10.430
Let me go! Let me go immediately!

1:05:10.538 --> 1:05:13.197
Well, well, well... gotcha!

1:05:13.272 --> 1:05:17.569
So here you are, Pinocchio,
the leader of the circus gang!

1:05:17.639 --> 1:05:20.571
What circus gang?
What are you even talking about?

1:05:20.639 --> 1:05:23.367
I don't understand! I did nothing wrong!

1:05:23.438 --> 1:05:26.063
That's what you all say,
but if everyone's innocent,

1:05:26.138 --> 1:05:28.968
who committed the robberies? Me?!

1:05:29.071 --> 1:05:32.060
I don't know! Maybe it was you!

1:05:32.138 --> 1:05:35.400
That's it! You talk way too much.

1:05:35.472 --> 1:05:38.666
You leave me no choice,
but to shut you up!

1:05:40.605 --> 1:05:41.799
Oh, no!

1:05:41.904 --> 1:05:44.337
He stuffed his dirty handkerchief
in your mouth!

1:05:44.438 --> 1:05:45.835
That's just nasty!

1:05:45.938 --> 1:05:48.633
I sure hope he didn't use it
to blow his nose.

1:05:48.739 --> 1:05:52.501
Look who's here!
The leader's right-hand horse!

1:05:52.605 --> 1:05:54.900
A certain someone named tibalt.

1:05:54.971 --> 1:05:56.802
If I'm not mistaken.

1:05:56.904 --> 1:05:59.303
I'm not just "someone."

1:05:59.405 --> 1:06:04.338
I am <i>signore</i> tibalt, a talent agent,
and I also happen to be the boy's father.

1:06:04.438 --> 1:06:06.097
And I demand that you unhand him!

1:06:08.405 --> 1:06:10.599
I'm sorry, what did you say?

1:06:10.705 --> 1:06:13.467
Did you hear that?

1:06:13.572 --> 1:06:16.732
This horse is ordering us
to let the boy go.

1:06:18.938 --> 1:06:20.462
Get him!

1:06:25.871 --> 1:06:27.702
Ha! Look at you!

1:06:27.772 --> 1:06:30.397
You think I'm scared of your guns?

1:06:30.472 --> 1:06:34.302
I am tibalt the brave, and I know no fear!

1:06:34.405 --> 1:06:37.269
Tibalt wasn't scared of the evil spirits!

1:06:37.372 --> 1:06:41.066
Tibalt jumped over the fence
with very sharp pointy things!

1:06:42.272 --> 1:06:46.102
So now tibalt
is about to show you something...

1:06:46.171 --> 1:06:48.069
And what would that be?

1:06:48.138 --> 1:06:49.900
Tibalt, run!

1:06:49.971 --> 1:06:52.495
Up to this moment, gentlemen,

1:06:52.605 --> 1:06:55.572
you've only seen my good side.

1:06:55.639 --> 1:06:57.662
But now...

1:06:57.771 --> 1:07:00.897
You'll see my bad side!

1:07:09.038 --> 1:07:11.596
Let's go!

1:07:24.871 --> 1:07:26.803
Why are you just hanging there?

1:07:26.904 --> 1:07:29.893
Get me down! Now!

1:07:29.971 --> 1:07:32.529
But we're stuck up here as well,
detective.

1:07:32.605 --> 1:07:33.866
How do we get you down?

1:07:33.938 --> 1:07:35.768
Oh, <i>mamma Mia!</i>

1:07:35.871 --> 1:07:38.361
Why do you have
to be such knuckleheads?!

1:07:54.804 --> 1:07:56.793
Thank you for saving me, tibalt.

1:07:56.904 --> 1:08:00.337
To tell you the truth,
I thought I'd never see you again.

1:08:00.438 --> 1:08:02.927
Well, I couldn't just leave you, could I?

1:08:03.005 --> 1:08:04.937
What are friends for?

1:08:05.005 --> 1:08:06.597
So, we're good?

1:08:06.672 --> 1:08:08.728
We're good.

1:08:11.904 --> 1:08:14.599
That's the detective's
handkerchief!

1:08:14.704 --> 1:08:19.365
Pinocchio, I just got an idea
about what I think we should go do next.

1:08:19.438 --> 1:08:22.870
But first, I have to go
check something out.

1:08:22.938 --> 1:08:24.632
And I have to go do it myself.

1:08:24.738 --> 1:08:26.398
What about me?

1:08:26.472 --> 1:08:29.904
If we go together, I'm afraid
you might get in my way,

1:08:29.971 --> 1:08:31.438
so wait here!

1:08:31.538 --> 1:08:33.630
Hold on, tibalt!

1:08:33.738 --> 1:08:36.068
- But I have to...
- Stay there!

1:08:36.138 --> 1:08:37.763
I'll be back soon!

1:08:39.871 --> 1:08:42.600
But I can't stay here.

1:08:42.671 --> 1:08:44.331
What about Bella?

1:08:44.438 --> 1:08:47.166
There's no time. I have to go warn her!

1:09:33.138 --> 1:09:34.298
Bella.

1:09:36.538 --> 1:09:37.970
Bella.

1:09:47.171 --> 1:09:49.069
Fantozzi!

1:09:49.138 --> 1:09:50.661
Have you seen Bella?

1:09:50.771 --> 1:09:53.829
- Pinocchio, I...
- I have.

1:09:56.405 --> 1:10:00.269
And I find it insulting
that you're asking this clown

1:10:00.338 --> 1:10:03.793
without coming to speak to <i>me</i> first.

1:10:03.904 --> 1:10:05.734
Where is she?!

1:10:05.804 --> 1:10:09.600
Don't you worry.
She's perfectly safe and sound.

1:10:10.604 --> 1:10:13.435
Let her go this instant, you hear me?!

1:10:13.505 --> 1:10:18.028
Or I promise you, I'll tell the whole
truth about what you're really doing!

1:10:18.105 --> 1:10:19.230
And then...

1:10:19.305 --> 1:10:21.533
Every one of you will go to jail!

1:10:21.604 --> 1:10:25.037
What? Is that a threat?

1:10:25.105 --> 1:10:28.867
<i>Senti,</i> mangiafuoco,
let me make a couple holes in this puppet!

1:10:28.938 --> 1:10:31.802
No! No need for violence.

1:10:31.904 --> 1:10:34.893
But cat is right.
You shouldn't threaten us.

1:10:34.971 --> 1:10:38.926
Besides, I don't think you really want
every one of us to go to jail.

1:10:40.571 --> 1:10:43.231
Oh, yes, everyone!

1:10:43.305 --> 1:10:46.397
Me, cat, fox,

1:10:46.472 --> 1:10:48.234
Bella...

1:10:48.305 --> 1:10:50.771
Bella? You're lying!

1:10:50.838 --> 1:10:53.328
Am I now? Ha.

1:10:53.438 --> 1:10:54.733
Pinocchio!

1:10:54.804 --> 1:10:56.827
What are you doing here?

1:10:56.938 --> 1:11:00.064
Bella, do you know what your father
and his friends really do?!

1:11:00.138 --> 1:11:02.434
Yes! I mean, no. I mean...

1:11:02.505 --> 1:11:04.403
I only recently found out, and I...

1:11:04.472 --> 1:11:07.597
So... you did know the truth.

1:11:07.671 --> 1:11:09.933
Tibalt was right.

1:11:10.005 --> 1:11:13.438
Wait, Pinocchio! Please,
at least let me explain!

1:11:13.504 --> 1:11:15.800
No, I don't want to hear it!

1:11:21.071 --> 1:11:24.368
You heard it right.
She knew the truth all along.

1:11:25.971 --> 1:11:28.562
Let's go, my boy. I have a big...

1:11:28.638 --> 1:11:32.071
No! No! A huge surprise for you!

1:11:32.138 --> 1:11:34.797
Mm?

1:11:36.272 --> 1:11:38.567
Let me go! Why are you doing this?

1:11:41.405 --> 1:11:42.962
Pinocchio?

1:11:43.071 --> 1:11:44.798
Hmm? Father?

1:11:44.904 --> 1:11:48.132
My son, I decided to come visit you,

1:11:48.238 --> 1:11:50.136
and look where we are...

1:11:50.238 --> 1:11:54.102
Isn't this touching?
How's that for a nice family reunion?

1:11:55.671 --> 1:11:58.660
Let my son go this very second!

1:11:58.771 --> 1:12:02.329
Let him go, you say? Oh, I don't think so!

1:12:02.438 --> 1:12:03.597
As a matter of fact,

1:12:03.671 --> 1:12:08.070
I have a counter business proposal
for <i>you</i> as a woodcarver.

1:12:08.138 --> 1:12:09.797
<i>Signore</i> geppetto,

1:12:09.904 --> 1:12:13.394
why don't you make
more puppets like Pinocchio?

1:12:13.471 --> 1:12:18.337
A whole troupe of talking puppets!
A dream come true!

1:12:18.437 --> 1:12:22.029
Pinocchio is not just a puppet!
He's a miracle!

1:12:22.105 --> 1:12:26.537
Then why don't you carve me
an army of these wooden miracles?

1:12:27.804 --> 1:12:29.896
You, sir, are a monster!

1:12:32.571 --> 1:12:35.038
No. I just didn't get enough sleep.

1:12:36.105 --> 1:12:39.197
For now, I'll leave you two to catch up.

1:12:39.272 --> 1:12:42.034
I need to lie down.

1:12:42.105 --> 1:12:44.799
Well?! You know what to do!

1:12:44.904 --> 1:12:48.734
You will perform
at my circus tonight, Pinocchio!

1:12:48.804 --> 1:12:54.101
And if you don't,
your dear old daddy will pay for it.

1:13:17.404 --> 1:13:19.098
Tibalt, it's just me.

1:13:19.171 --> 1:13:21.603
Y-Yes, I see that now.

1:13:23.038 --> 1:13:27.937
Uh... have you seen Pinocchio anywhere?

1:13:30.105 --> 1:13:34.594
You know, mangiafuoco has him
locked up in a cage with geppetto.

1:13:34.704 --> 1:13:39.069
What? Because of you,
they're both locked up?!

1:13:39.138 --> 1:13:41.763
I swear, I've never wanted
any of this to happen.

1:13:41.871 --> 1:13:43.769
Sure you haven't!

1:13:43.871 --> 1:13:48.031
You know, you were the reason
Pinocchio decided to come back!

1:13:48.105 --> 1:13:51.935
Are you aware that we're wanted
by the police?

1:13:52.038 --> 1:13:56.164
He wanted to rescue you,
and now he's behind bars!

1:13:56.272 --> 1:13:57.897
Tibalt, you have to believe me.

1:13:57.971 --> 1:14:00.665
I didn't know what my father
was doing behind my back.

1:14:00.771 --> 1:14:03.829
Your <i>father?</i>

1:14:03.938 --> 1:14:08.427
Yes! He, the cat and the fox Rob
people's houses during our show times.

1:14:08.504 --> 1:14:11.937
I knew it all along.

1:14:12.005 --> 1:14:15.335
You were involved in this shady business!

1:14:15.437 --> 1:14:18.268
I didn't mean to! You have to believe me.

1:14:18.337 --> 1:14:20.770
I want to help Pinocchio,
but I don't know how!

1:14:23.437 --> 1:14:25.529
Oh...

1:14:25.604 --> 1:14:28.798
I'm sorry, but where did you get
that handkerchief?

1:14:28.904 --> 1:14:34.359
This one? It was with me when mangiafuoco
found me in the woods as a child.

1:14:34.437 --> 1:14:37.132
He's not my real father.

1:14:39.272 --> 1:14:42.363
Well, this changes everything.

1:14:42.437 --> 1:14:45.699
Hmm... lyusilda was right.

1:14:45.771 --> 1:14:49.965
Sometimes miracles
do happen in this world, eh?

1:14:53.071 --> 1:14:56.060
Dad, I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.

1:14:56.138 --> 1:14:59.502
I should have never left my home.

1:14:59.604 --> 1:15:03.332
And now, I'm a pathetic thief to them all.

1:15:03.437 --> 1:15:04.961
I swear, I didn't know!

1:15:05.071 --> 1:15:06.764
Of course, Pinocchio.

1:15:06.838 --> 1:15:09.736
I have never doubted your honesty, son.

1:15:09.804 --> 1:15:10.827
Thank you, dad.

1:15:10.938 --> 1:15:13.632
Listen, Pinocchio,
we have to do something.

1:15:13.738 --> 1:15:15.227
We can't let them get away with it.

1:15:15.304 --> 1:15:17.566
Well, what can we possibly do?

1:15:17.638 --> 1:15:19.934
I promised that I would perform tonight.

1:15:20.005 --> 1:15:21.471
I gave them my word.

1:15:21.571 --> 1:15:23.560
And you will keep your word.

1:15:23.638 --> 1:15:26.764
I swear on my beautiful, regal name.

1:15:26.838 --> 1:15:29.600
Tibalt! You found us!

1:15:29.704 --> 1:15:30.966
Of course I did!

1:15:31.071 --> 1:15:33.867
You didn't think you could
get rid of me that easily.

1:15:33.938 --> 1:15:36.234
I promised geppetto to look after you,

1:15:36.304 --> 1:15:39.760
and horses are well-known
for keeping their word.

1:15:39.871 --> 1:15:41.530
What do you think we should do, tibalt?

1:15:41.604 --> 1:15:45.037
Well, I have a plan.
I've got everything figured out.

1:15:45.105 --> 1:15:46.935
We will perform tonight.

1:15:47.038 --> 1:15:51.028
We'll put on a show that mangiafuoco
won't soon forget!

1:15:51.105 --> 1:15:55.628
And the best thing is,
this time we will not have to do it alone.

1:16:14.404 --> 1:16:17.666
Ladies and gentlemen!

1:16:17.771 --> 1:16:20.794
Please allow me to present to you

1:16:20.904 --> 1:16:24.393
the discovery of the season!

1:16:24.471 --> 1:16:29.029
The world's one and only talking puppet!

1:16:29.105 --> 1:16:32.935
Pinocchio!

1:16:33.038 --> 1:16:37.698
And his horse, tibalt!

1:16:56.237 --> 1:16:57.397
Bravo!

1:16:58.571 --> 1:16:59.901
That's amazing!

1:17:00.971 --> 1:17:02.232
- Pinocchio!
- Pinocchio!

1:17:03.337 --> 1:17:05.565
My little hero!

1:17:10.638 --> 1:17:13.263
Would you look at that?

1:17:13.337 --> 1:17:15.736
Everything is going according to plan.

1:17:15.804 --> 1:17:17.793
It's time for you two to get to it.

1:17:17.904 --> 1:17:20.504
- May I have your attention, please?!
- You should see this, boss.

1:17:22.437 --> 1:17:24.267
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:17:24.337 --> 1:17:26.997
I have an important announcement to make!

1:17:27.105 --> 1:17:29.400
Me and my friends

1:17:29.471 --> 1:17:32.597
have prepared a little song
for you to enjoy.

1:17:34.005 --> 1:17:38.130
A song? I don't remember approving this.

1:17:38.237 --> 1:17:42.295

What in the world is this?
Did any of you know about this?

1:19:04.137 --> 1:19:07.069
Boss, we need to stop the show
immediately!

1:19:07.137 --> 1:19:10.729
What? No way am I giving people
their money back!

1:19:10.804 --> 1:19:11.998
Boss?

1:19:12.104 --> 1:19:15.731
I'm sorry, but I think we have guests.

1:19:22.671 --> 1:19:25.001
Police! I knew it!

1:19:25.104 --> 1:19:28.833
I don't know about you,
but I would like to stay out of jail!

1:19:31.437 --> 1:19:33.961
Dear ladies! Dear gentlemen!

1:19:34.070 --> 1:19:36.162
I didn't Rob anyone!

1:19:36.271 --> 1:19:38.795
Well, I did. But they made me!

1:19:38.904 --> 1:19:42.598
I'm just an artist.
You know me! You love me!

1:19:45.271 --> 1:19:48.829
Me too! Believe me,
I never meant to Rob anyone!

1:19:54.638 --> 1:19:58.400
You have to believe us,
it was mangiafuoco!

1:19:58.471 --> 1:20:00.096
He is the one behind it all.

1:20:00.170 --> 1:20:03.262
You're gonna get arrested! Scoundrels!

1:20:05.437 --> 1:20:07.233
Please! Please!

1:20:07.304 --> 1:20:10.134
What kind of ridiculous accusations
are those?

1:20:10.237 --> 1:20:12.431
It's obviously a lie.

1:20:12.537 --> 1:20:15.060
Besides, you have absolutely no proof.

1:20:15.137 --> 1:20:17.365
You have no witnesses!

1:20:17.437 --> 1:20:19.096
We are the witnesses!

1:20:20.104 --> 1:20:22.628
Attention, everyone!

1:20:22.738 --> 1:20:27.966
My noble friend tibalt
told me what's going on in your circus.

1:20:28.070 --> 1:20:31.969
And now, I have testimony
from several witnesses,

1:20:32.070 --> 1:20:34.298
as well as confessions from the culprits...

1:20:34.404 --> 1:20:36.894
The cat and the fox.

1:20:36.970 --> 1:20:42.426
<i>Signore</i> mangiafuoco,
you are under arrest!

1:20:42.537 --> 1:20:47.368
What? My ingenious plan is ruined?!

1:20:47.437 --> 1:20:50.369
Oh, it's all your fault!

1:20:50.437 --> 1:20:52.802
You stupid puppet!

1:21:04.271 --> 1:21:06.431
Fire!

1:21:11.271 --> 1:21:13.067
Get out of the way!

1:21:13.137 --> 1:21:17.263
Quickly! Arrest the cat,
the fox, and mangiafuoco!

1:21:17.337 --> 1:21:20.167
Ha! Good luck with that!

1:21:20.271 --> 1:21:21.271
Oh?

1:21:34.104 --> 1:21:35.764
Oh!

1:21:35.838 --> 1:21:37.167
Don't worry, I'm here.

1:21:37.271 --> 1:21:39.761
Get over here!

1:21:39.838 --> 1:21:42.327
You will be my ticket out of here.

1:21:42.437 --> 1:21:43.960
Out of my way!

1:21:44.070 --> 1:21:45.628
Pinocchio!

1:21:45.738 --> 1:21:48.136
Get your paws off her!

1:21:48.237 --> 1:21:52.466
Stay back, or I will hurt
your little girlfriend!

1:21:54.671 --> 1:21:57.296
<i>Mamma Mia!</i> I have to get out!

1:21:57.404 --> 1:22:00.234
And you stay here!

1:22:04.504 --> 1:22:07.334
- Pinocchio!
- Bella, I'm coming!

1:22:08.838 --> 1:22:10.963
Hold on, I got you!

1:22:11.070 --> 1:22:13.560
Grab the ring, and I'll let you go!

1:22:16.104 --> 1:22:17.571
Pinocchio!

1:22:17.638 --> 1:22:19.126
Hold on!

1:22:22.104 --> 1:22:23.264
Bella!

1:22:24.271 --> 1:22:26.465
Pinocchio!

1:22:26.571 --> 1:22:28.560
I'm coming to help!

1:22:32.771 --> 1:22:35.738
What are you doing, Bella?
Go on! Get out of here!

1:22:35.804 --> 1:22:38.429
But Pinocchio is still out there!

1:22:40.537 --> 1:22:43.128
I said, now!

1:22:43.237 --> 1:22:46.101
I've always known that I'd die young!

1:22:52.571 --> 1:22:54.731
I'm coming, my friend!

1:23:23.170 --> 1:23:24.966
Is he alive?

1:23:28.671 --> 1:23:31.638
Pinocchio! My poor boy!

1:23:34.738 --> 1:23:37.760
Pinocchio! Pinocchio, do you hear me?!

1:23:37.837 --> 1:23:40.236
Wake up, I'm begging you.

1:23:40.304 --> 1:23:41.566
Wake up, Pinocchio!

1:23:56.504 --> 1:23:58.732
Oh, no!

1:24:11.803 --> 1:24:13.429
Pinocchio...?

1:24:13.504 --> 1:24:16.765
Buddy! You are alive!

1:24:16.870 --> 1:24:19.394
Uh, yeah, I guess so...

1:24:19.471 --> 1:24:22.869
And you are human now!

1:24:22.937 --> 1:24:23.937
What?

1:24:24.903 --> 1:24:25.903
What am I?

1:24:27.304 --> 1:24:28.566
I'm really human?

1:24:28.638 --> 1:24:29.967
Of course you are.

1:24:30.070 --> 1:24:32.366
Don't you remember what I said?

1:24:32.437 --> 1:24:35.369
Everything comes in due time, Pinocchio.

1:24:36.903 --> 1:24:40.733
<i>Signora</i> lyusilda! Did you do this?

1:24:43.770 --> 1:24:47.294
No, my sweet boy. You did it yourself.

1:24:47.404 --> 1:24:50.530
You sacrificed yourself for another.

1:24:50.604 --> 1:24:56.367
Only someone with a real heart
and soul could do this.

1:24:56.437 --> 1:25:01.699
I am so sorry I wrongly accused you,
my dear Pinocchio.

1:25:01.770 --> 1:25:04.964
<i>Signore</i> tibalt told me the whole story,

1:25:05.070 --> 1:25:07.968
and we came up with a perfect plan

1:25:08.070 --> 1:25:11.264
for catching the real criminals.

1:25:11.371 --> 1:25:14.269
And look at that! They're all arrested!

1:25:15.271 --> 1:25:17.737
And the case is closed!

1:25:18.737 --> 1:25:21.397
And now, it's time for me to go back

1:25:21.471 --> 1:25:23.994
and start the paperwork on the case.

1:25:24.104 --> 1:25:26.469
Just one minute there.

1:25:26.571 --> 1:25:28.832
The case is not closed just yet.

1:25:28.937 --> 1:25:30.426
Detective brioni,

1:25:30.504 --> 1:25:33.902
would you be so kind as to show me
your handkerchief?

1:25:34.903 --> 1:25:37.336
My handkerchief? Um...

1:25:37.437 --> 1:25:39.426
I don't think I have it.

1:25:39.504 --> 1:25:40.992
Of course not.

1:25:41.104 --> 1:25:43.594
You left it in my mouth, remember?

1:25:43.670 --> 1:25:46.160
Great.

1:25:46.271 --> 1:25:49.999
Now, Bella, would you show us
<i>your</i> handkerchief?

1:25:55.271 --> 1:25:58.499
<i>Signorina,</i> where did you get this?

1:25:58.604 --> 1:26:01.332
It has my family's monogram on it.

1:26:01.437 --> 1:26:05.733
I had it with me when mangiafuoco
found me in the woods.

1:26:08.437 --> 1:26:11.664
Hey! Bring mangiafuoco over here!

1:26:14.670 --> 1:26:16.159
Tell me the truth,

1:26:16.271 --> 1:26:19.260
and it will be used in your favor
during the trial!

1:26:19.337 --> 1:26:23.395
Will it, now? Ha! Very well then.

1:26:23.471 --> 1:26:26.698
I'll tell you the truth.
I never found you.

1:26:26.770 --> 1:26:28.567
I just bought you, little girl,

1:26:28.637 --> 1:26:31.297
from someone who kidnapped you
from you parents!

1:26:33.137 --> 1:26:36.434
Oh, my god. It was 11 years ago.

1:26:36.537 --> 1:26:40.128
My darling little daughter
went missing, and that's when...

1:26:40.237 --> 1:26:44.794
That's when I decided to become
a detective and find the kidnappers!

1:26:44.903 --> 1:26:48.063
So, all this time I thought
I was looking for criminals.

1:26:48.137 --> 1:26:50.728
But it turns out,
I've found my own daughter!

1:26:50.803 --> 1:26:53.565
You are my father?

1:26:56.437 --> 1:26:59.801
Yes. Your mother will be
so happy to see you.

1:26:59.903 --> 1:27:01.596
This is so nice.

1:27:08.237 --> 1:27:09.566
Bella, congratulations!

1:27:10.737 --> 1:27:14.966
Detective brioni, Bella,
I'm so happy for you!

1:27:16.070 --> 1:27:18.366
Thank you!
I can't believe it myself!

1:27:18.437 --> 1:27:19.869
It's incredible!

1:27:39.937 --> 1:27:41.994
Ladies and gentlemen!

1:27:42.104 --> 1:27:45.661
We're proud to present
our show for you tonight!

1:27:45.770 --> 1:27:51.499
Welcome to the amazing new circus
of "the brioni family and their friends"!

1:27:52.603 --> 1:27:53.660
Hooray!

1:28:10.570 --> 1:28:11.730
Bravo!

1:28:14.670 --> 1:28:16.068
Whoo!

1:28:19.503 --> 1:28:21.560
Ah-yup! Ah-yup!

1:28:21.637 --> 1:28:22.899
Ha ha!

1:28:34.903 --> 1:28:36.301
Brava!

1:29:01.070 --> 1:29:02.968
Bravo, Pinocchio!

1:29:03.070 --> 1:29:04.695
Pinocchio!

1:29:16.903 --> 1:29:18.426
Whoa!

1:29:18.536 --> 1:29:20.060
Are you sure?

1:29:20.137 --> 1:29:22.365
I am, tibalt! Go!

1:29:32.903 --> 1:29:34.801
Whoa! Whoa!
