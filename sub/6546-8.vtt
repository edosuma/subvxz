WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:02.541
Nathan: Previously on Haven...

00:02.628 --> 00:04.368
- Where's the body, officer?
- There isn't one.

00:04.463 --> 00:06.624
These shadows were
all that was left of them.

00:10.052 --> 00:11.462
- Do you know
what kind of Trouble this is?

00:11.554 --> 00:13.044
- We're ghosts.
You're dead.

00:13.222 --> 00:15.053
Nathan: I'm not really a ghost.
I'm alive.

00:15.141 --> 00:16.847
- I will tell you what I know,

00:16.934 --> 00:18.845
but you must
give me something first--

00:18.936 --> 00:20.597
the Crocker family journal.

00:20.688 --> 00:21.973
- You're not getting it.

00:22.064 --> 00:23.053
Audrey: Detective Parker.
(shutter clicking)

00:23.149 --> 00:24.138
I'm trying
to track someone down.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.064
Do you mind if I look
through those?

00:26.152 --> 00:27.141
Do you know who that is?

00:27.236 --> 00:29.022
- No, but he was here
all morning

00:29.113 --> 00:30.978
staring at everybody, like a creep.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.279
- On your knees.

00:33.576 --> 00:35.908
- Oh, jeez.
What the hell is that?

00:36.996 --> 00:39.328
- I'm just really afraid I'm
not gonna be able to save you.

00:39.415 --> 00:41.326
- I will come back.
I promise.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.248
Morgan?
Glenn?

00:50.551 --> 00:52.291
J‘J‘

00:52.386 --> 00:53.375
(door opens)

00:56.766 --> 00:59.098
- I don't know what's gonna
kill me first, boredom

00:59.185 --> 01:00.721
or your cooking.

01:00.811 --> 01:04.349
- I will make sure to convey your
concerns to hotel management.

01:04.440 --> 01:06.522
- Seeing as how
I hold all the cards,

01:06.609 --> 01:09.692
lwould be trying much harder
to get on my good side.

01:09.779 --> 01:11.644
- Says the woman
who is chained to a chair.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.438
- Exactly my point.

01:15.201 --> 01:16.737
Audrey's not immune
to the Troubles,

01:16.827 --> 01:19.079
Nathan's a phantom,
and you're about to erupt.

01:19.163 --> 01:22.951
You have one good resource,

01:23.042 --> 01:24.578
and you've chained her
to a boat.

01:24.669 --> 01:26.705
- I think that you have
an overinflated sense

01:26.796 --> 01:28.707
of your own importance.

01:28.798 --> 01:30.038
I would have already
thrown you overboard

01:30.132 --> 01:32.043
if we didn't need you
to communicate with Nathan.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.542
- Well, if you want something,

01:34.637 --> 01:36.548
you have to give
something first.

01:36.639 --> 01:38.755
- You're not getting
the Crocker family journal.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.714
- Well, you know how
negotiations work--

01:40.810 --> 01:42.141
start with a big ask...

01:42.228 --> 01:44.435
- And then you fall back
on what you really want, huh?

01:44.522 --> 01:45.511
- Mm-hmm.

01:47.233 --> 01:49.019
- Well, please,
by all means.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.820
- Tell me a story.

01:54.282 --> 01:55.772
Tell me about your mother.

02:00.663 --> 02:01.652
(chuckles)

02:03.708 --> 02:05.699
Why do you wanna know
about her?

02:05.793 --> 02:08.751
- Well, you drone on
and on about your father.

02:08.838 --> 02:10.453
You've hardly ever said a
word to Audrey

02:10.548 --> 02:11.754
about your mother.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.291
- Forget it.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.884
- You know,
Nathan's life is on the line.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.015
And all I want is a story.

02:25.438 --> 02:27.770
- What do you mean,
Nathan's life is on the line?

02:27.857 --> 02:29.438
- When you were out there
burning my lunch,

02:29.525 --> 02:31.106
Nathan stopped by.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.024
Someone is
killing all of his friends

02:33.112 --> 02:35.148
over in ghost world.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.730
Left Nathan
a threatening note--

02:37.825 --> 02:39.986
dramatic, cryptic.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.363
So you know,
ticktock.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.947
- Did Nathan
say anything else?

02:46.042 --> 02:47.703
- Only the first one's free.

02:47.793 --> 02:50.455
So now, it's your turn.
If you and that animated husk

02:50.546 --> 02:52.537
ever wanna see your doe-eyed
boyfriend again,

02:52.631 --> 02:54.963
I suggest you start
diving into your mommy issues.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.424
- Not gonna happen.

02:58.888 --> 03:00.469
- Well, all right, then.

03:00.556 --> 03:02.387
If you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

03:05.311 --> 03:07.302
- Why leave a message?

03:07.396 --> 03:10.604
Is it a warning?
A threat?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.522
- I didn't even know
this was possible.

03:12.610 --> 03:15.101
Maybe whoever did this

03:15.196 --> 03:17.983
killed Glenn because--

03:18.074 --> 03:19.735
- Because he was helping me.

03:21.327 --> 03:22.658
- That was rude.

03:22.745 --> 03:24.326
I'm sorry.
I don't know.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.495
What does your forensic evidence
or whatever tell you?

03:28.417 --> 03:30.453
- Killer used a long,
smooth blade.

03:31.462 --> 03:32.451
But how?

03:33.422 --> 03:35.583
We can't touch anything.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.380
Has anyone figured
out a way to move things

03:37.468 --> 03:39.333
or pick something up
in this state?

03:39.428 --> 03:40.759
- No.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.427
We can only touch
other ghosts

03:42.515 --> 03:45.302
and what we had with
us when we crossed over.

03:45.393 --> 03:48.009
- We all cross over as our--

03:48.104 --> 03:49.469
what'd you call it?

03:49.563 --> 03:51.178
- Residual self image.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.605
I actually stole it
from The Matrix.

03:55.319 --> 03:56.900
- So someone's
residual self image

03:56.987 --> 03:58.488
includes a big knife?

03:58.614 --> 04:01.356
- Says the guy
with the gun on his hip.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.826
- Fair enough.

04:02.910 --> 04:03.899
So you know any ghosts

04:03.994 --> 04:06.701
that carry around a knife?

04:06.789 --> 04:09.030
- No.
- Then we're all vulnerable

04:09.125 --> 04:10.865
until we solve this Trouble.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.667
J‘J‘

04:13.754 --> 04:14.743
(chatter)

04:15.798 --> 04:17.789
- What's wrong?
What did Mara say?

04:17.883 --> 04:19.623
- She knows we need her help.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.128
And she's using it
as leverage.

04:21.220 --> 04:23.677
- Okay.
What does she want?

04:23.764 --> 04:25.220
- It doesn't matter.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.888
We don't know what she's
planning, what she really wants,

04:26.976 --> 04:29.012
and if we give her anything, who
knows what she'll do with it?

04:29.103 --> 04:30.934
- Duke, what did she say?

04:31.981 --> 04:33.391
- Nathan's in danger.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.144
Someone is killing the victims
of this Trouble.

04:36.402 --> 04:39.189
- What?
- Killing other ghosts.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.487
- Did she say who?
- That's all she told me.

04:41.574 --> 04:44.316
- All right, there's gotta be some
other way we can talk to him.

04:44.410 --> 04:45.399
- How?

04:45.494 --> 04:46.654
Audrey, he could
be here right now

04:46.745 --> 04:48.827
- and we wouldn't even know it.
- But even if we can't see him,

04:48.914 --> 04:51.701
there's gotta be something else
about him that we can sense.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.657
- Yeah, sorry.
My sense of smell is shot.

04:53.752 --> 04:57.415
- An energy signature
or infrared,

04:57.506 --> 05:00.088
a... motion detector, In

05:00.176 --> 05:01.165
- Wait.

05:02.678 --> 05:04.418
That's it.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.754
Oh, I can't believe
I'm gonna do this, but--

05:06.849 --> 05:08.339
(phone beeps, Duke sighs)

05:09.310 --> 05:10.550
Who you gonna call?

05:10.644 --> 05:14.182
(cell phone buzzing)

05:23.949 --> 05:26.691
- Darkside Seekers.
We hunt what's haunting you.

05:27.620 --> 05:28.609
(coughs)

05:28.913 --> 05:32.997
J‘J‘

05:59.151 --> 06:02.234
J‘J‘

06:03.197 --> 06:04.186
Vince: Oh.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.818
I'm not gonna let you win

06:06.909 --> 06:09.150
just because
you're in the hospital.

06:09.245 --> 06:10.826
- My dear Vincent, you
couldn't beat me

06:10.913 --> 06:13.154
if I was
in a brain-dead coma.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.326
- Gin.
- Oh.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.032
(chuckles, footsteps approaching)

06:17.127 --> 06:18.458
- Dr. Reynolds.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.582
There's a face
that could cure what ails you.

06:20.673 --> 06:22.288
Here for one last sponge bath

06:22.383 --> 06:24.169
before releasing
your favorite patient?

06:24.426 --> 06:26.758
- One night with me and you'd be
back in this hospital for good.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.346
(all laughing)

06:28.430 --> 06:30.466
Speaking of which,
looks like you'll have time

06:30.558 --> 06:32.549
for a few more hands of Rummy
before heading out.

06:32.643 --> 06:35.134
- What do you mean?
His injuries were all minor.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.265
- Injuries from
the car crash were.

06:37.356 --> 06:40.268
But that is a nasty infection
on your leg.

06:40.359 --> 06:42.691
I've honestly never seen
anything like it.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.526
Oh, boys.

06:45.614 --> 06:48.196
I didn't mean to worry you.
I'm sure it's nothing.

06:48.284 --> 06:49.865
We're just a little bit
out of our depth here.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.738
So we're gonna take
a small biopsy

06:51.829 --> 06:53.444
and send it off for analysis.

06:53.539 --> 06:55.996
I promise it won't hurt...
Much.

07:02.464 --> 07:03.670
J‘J‘

07:03.757 --> 07:05.372
- Can't we
just deal with this

07:05.467 --> 07:06.718
when we get back home?

07:06.802 --> 07:09.384
- Sorry, old goat,
it's hospital policy.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.928
If we don't know what it is,
we can't have you

07:12.016 --> 07:13.802
walking the streets with it.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.932
(gasping lightly)
There.

07:16.020 --> 07:18.557
Just sit tight for a few
days till we get the all clear.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.567
- Well, look at this.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.064
Here we are again,

07:27.156 --> 07:29.397
Miss Marvel, Dave Navarro,

07:29.491 --> 07:31.823
and yours truly,
the token geek.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.953
- Seth, it's nice to--
- Well, that's weird.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.905
I take it from
your desperate phone call

07:38.000 --> 07:41.584
and baffled expressions that
you're in dire straits.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.206
Well, fear not, my friends,

07:43.297 --> 07:45.083
the cavalry has arrived.

07:45.174 --> 07:47.039
- God help us.
(clears throat)

07:47.134 --> 07:49.216
Where's your better half?

07:49.303 --> 07:50.588
- Oh, who, Anderson?

07:50.679 --> 07:54.297
He's probably swimming in a silo
full of gold doubloons

07:54.391 --> 07:55.597
like Scrooge McDuck.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.225
Who knew that matching
like-colored candy

07:58.312 --> 08:00.098
was worth millions of dollars?

08:00.189 --> 08:02.271
Really makes college
seem like a sound investment.

08:02.358 --> 08:03.939
- All right, guys,
I'd love to catch up,

08:04.026 --> 08:06.608
but we really need to figure out
what's going on here.

08:06.695 --> 08:08.231
- Yes, right.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.812
Nathan, he's a ghost.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.439
- Not necessarily a ghost,
he's just--

08:12.534 --> 08:14.240
- Ghost, incorporeal,
doesn't matter.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.114
Let me tell you something.

08:16.205 --> 08:19.743
A lot of the strange things
that happen around here,

08:19.833 --> 08:21.824
people dismiss it
as paranormal activity.

08:21.919 --> 08:24.786
But just because these things
are caused by the Troubles,

08:24.880 --> 08:27.371
doesn't mean they're
not bound by physical laws.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.583
Gravity, nuclear bonds,
electromagnetic fields--

08:30.678 --> 08:33.511
- Seth, is there a point
buried in there somewhere?

08:33.597 --> 08:35.462
- Okay, I think

08:35.557 --> 08:39.971
that Nathan should still radiate
an electromagnetic field.

08:40.062 --> 08:42.269
So even though we can't see
him, even though we can't hear him

08:42.356 --> 08:43.812
or-or feel him,

08:43.899 --> 08:46.481
he should still have
an electromagnetic presence.

08:46.568 --> 08:49.435
And that, lucky for you...

08:49.530 --> 08:51.566
(device clicks softly)
daddy can track.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.154
(beeping)

09:01.250 --> 09:03.241
- Okay.
Audrey: What's going on?

09:03.335 --> 09:06.327
(beeping and clicking rapidly)
Seth: Wow. Whoa.

09:06.422 --> 09:08.003
- Is that good?

09:08.090 --> 09:09.580
- Well, it's definitely spooky.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.341
There's a ghost...

09:13.429 --> 09:15.511
- right here.
- Is it Nathan?

09:15.597 --> 09:17.337
- They must be desperate.
- I don't know.

09:17.433 --> 09:19.139
Do you have more than
one ghost haunting your office?

09:19.226 --> 09:20.591
- Seth, I just--
- Well, I don't know for sure

09:20.686 --> 09:22.017
if it's Nathan,
but I mean,

09:22.104 --> 09:24.766
if it is him, he should be
listening to us right now.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.516
- Nathan...

09:30.779 --> 09:33.862
I'm gonna bring you back.

09:33.949 --> 09:35.689
Can you make it
so that he can talk back?

09:35.784 --> 09:37.320
- I'll have to modify some
internal components,

09:37.411 --> 09:39.151
probably set up
a sensory detector and--

09:39.246 --> 09:40.452
- That's not a bad idea...
- Seth, yes or no?

09:40.581 --> 09:41.570
- Um, eventually...

09:42.624 --> 09:43.613
Yes?

09:43.709 --> 09:44.789
- Great. Do that.
- Do it?

09:44.877 --> 09:46.538
- Do it.
- All right-- I'll be back.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.539
(sighing)
- Duke, do you think you would consider

09:48.630 --> 09:51.007
going another round with Mara?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.922
Anything that she could tell us
about this Trouble

09:53.010 --> 09:54.090
would be really helpful.

09:54.178 --> 09:55.759
- Look, I go in there
singing the same song,

09:55.846 --> 09:57.677
- we're gonna get the same result.
- Okay. Well, then maybe

09:57.765 --> 10:00.222
we should consider
giving her a bit of what she wants.

10:00.309 --> 10:02.721
- Audrey, we can't trust her.
- I don't trust her.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.426
But I trust you.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.307
Please.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.979
If it means
getting Nathan back.

10:10.152 --> 10:11.141
(sighs)

10:12.988 --> 10:15.024
All right,
I'll talk to her.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.660
- I'm gonna keep digging,
Nathan.

10:31.423 --> 10:32.412
When I find something,

10:32.508 --> 10:34.999
I'll-I'll leave you
a note here.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.335
- Good work, Parker.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.419
(creaking)

10:46.814 --> 10:48.725
- I take it you would
prefer to drink your lunch.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.102
- Think I'll spill
all my secrets

10:52.194 --> 10:54.105
ifl get a little booze in me?

10:54.196 --> 10:55.356
- I don't know.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.198
But it usually works on me.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.613
(chair thuds)

10:58.700 --> 11:00.076
(sighs)

11:00.160 --> 11:02.242
And if I'm gonna sit here
and talk about my mother...

11:02.329 --> 11:03.865
(cork pops)

11:03.956 --> 11:06.914
well, then I need to be very...

11:07.000 --> 11:08.956
very drunk.

11:17.052 --> 11:20.260
J‘J‘

11:22.683 --> 11:23.718
Audrey: Damn it.

11:23.809 --> 11:25.970
- It's worthless.
Seth: Okay.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.722
I'm sorry.
Can you give me a chance here?

11:27.813 --> 11:28.848
This is my first time building

11:28.939 --> 11:30.475
an interplanar
communication device

11:30.566 --> 11:32.352
using hand-me-down
police radios.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.524
- I'm talking about... this.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.570
I asked for these photos
from this photographer named Amy

11:38.657 --> 11:40.898
at the farmers' market.
I just keep staring at them,

11:40.993 --> 11:43.029
hoping that something new
will jump out.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.985
- Well, maybe take a break.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.945
You know, grab a coffee,
give it a minute.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.029
- I don't have a minute.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.661
The longer it takes me
to ID. this suspect,

11:49.751 --> 11:53.619
the longer Nathan's stuck
wherever he is with a killer.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.670
Look, I'm sorry.
It's just...

11:55.757 --> 11:58.134
this is the kind of thing
we used to do together.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.254
- Right.
Working together.

12:02.598 --> 12:03.963
It's nice.
I miss it.

12:04.850 --> 12:05.839
- Yeah.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.266
Me too.

12:08.353 --> 12:12.187
Without Nathan, maybe
I just can't do this anymore.

12:12.274 --> 12:15.391
- Hey, listen,
I have seen my share

12:15.485 --> 12:17.692
of the supernatural and
the unexplained.

12:19.031 --> 12:22.444
And I have dealt with
the people living with it.

12:22.534 --> 12:25.150
I mean, I used to think that
I was helping those people.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.860
I really did.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.662
And then I met you and Nathan.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.615
Look, I used to look at
a guy like this,

12:31.710 --> 12:33.666
and I would see a...

12:33.754 --> 12:35.494
a paranormal curiosity.

12:35.589 --> 12:38.376
I would see a-a-a specimen
to study.

12:38.467 --> 12:41.209
But you see
through the weird.

12:41.303 --> 12:44.295
You see a person
who needs help.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.974
- So my friends are working
on a way to communicate with us.

12:53.065 --> 12:54.805
- That's possible?

12:54.900 --> 12:56.811
I could actually
talk to my fiancée again?

12:56.902 --> 12:59.234
- More than that.
Once we can talk to them,

12:59.321 --> 13:01.937
maybe we can find whoever's
trouble is causing this,

13:02.032 --> 13:03.772
find a way to go home.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.574
First, we need to stop
this killer.

13:06.662 --> 13:08.368
- That's what
I wanted to tell you.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.787
Some friends saw a new guy
stalking around--

13:10.874 --> 13:12.660
bearded, rough-looking...

13:13.377 --> 13:15.163
Maybe the kind of guy
who'd carry a knife.

13:17.756 --> 13:21.123
- One day, somebody gonna
do what's right.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.958
Take you down.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.635
- Reggie.
- You know him?

13:25.722 --> 13:27.553
- He blames me for what's
happened to Haven.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.095
And he wants me dead.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.347
J‘J‘

13:37.526 --> 13:40.643
- They'll have to call in the
National Guard to hold me down.

13:40.737 --> 13:41.817
We're getting out of here.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.315
- But what about the sample?

13:43.407 --> 13:45.318
- The sample, the wound,

13:45.409 --> 13:48.151
the thinny,
let's put it all behind us.

13:48.245 --> 13:51.703
We need to get back to Haven
and do what we do best,

13:51.790 --> 13:54.122
what we swore to
Garland Wuornos we'd do--

13:54.209 --> 13:55.289
protect Haven.

13:55.377 --> 13:57.618
- I'm talking about
protecting Haven.

13:57.713 --> 13:59.328
We need to steal that biopsy

13:59.423 --> 14:01.459
before they send it away
for analysis.

14:01.550 --> 14:04.292
- It's not that bad.
- You're not making any sense.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.923
Your leg was wounded back when
you were dangling in the void.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.676
That biopsy could be
swimming in God only knows what.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.137
If we just walk away

14:13.228 --> 14:16.265
and they find something,
they'll come to Haven.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.517
The secrets we worked
our whole life to protect

14:18.608 --> 14:21.600
will be revealed,
and we would be responsible.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.562
- What if we get caught?
What if I get caught?

14:24.656 --> 14:26.567
You think they'll care
about a little tissue sample

14:26.658 --> 14:28.068
when they've got patient zero?

14:28.160 --> 14:31.448
I will not spend the years
that l have left

14:31.538 --> 14:33.403
as a science experiment!

14:33.498 --> 14:35.705
I'm sorry, but I can't.

14:35.792 --> 14:36.907
I'm leaving.

14:38.837 --> 14:39.826
(scoffs)

14:41.006 --> 14:41.995
(sighs)

14:42.090 --> 14:43.079
(waves lapping)

14:46.178 --> 14:48.715
- This is the one thing
Americans do better

14:48.805 --> 14:50.011
than anyone else.

14:50.098 --> 14:51.429
- What, drinking?
(splashing)

14:51.516 --> 14:52.505
- Bourbon.

14:52.601 --> 14:53.761
- Cheers to that.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.014
- Are you drunk enough yet?

14:58.273 --> 15:00.980
Come on, Duke, your mother
can't be that terrible.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.854
Is she worse than me?

15:02.944 --> 15:05.026
- Well, now, that just depends
on your perspective.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.102
(laughs)

15:08.867 --> 15:10.277
(clears throat)
Okay.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.200
When my Dad died...

15:16.291 --> 15:18.202
the state tried
to declare me an orphan.

15:20.170 --> 15:22.536
And just before the paperwork
came through...

15:23.673 --> 15:25.538
my dear, sweet mom showed up

15:25.634 --> 15:27.124
to reunite the family.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.054
I was just a stupid kid,
eight years old.

15:31.014 --> 15:33.175
I actually believed that
things would be different.

15:34.476 --> 15:35.682
- But it wasn't.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.678
- Even at that age, it didn't
take me long to realize

15:39.773 --> 15:42.731
that l was just
my mom's next meal ticket.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.685
She turned my dad's place
into a flophouse.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.862
Wasn't long before
protective services shut that down.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.315
She didn't come around
very much after that.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.320
By the time
I got to high school,

15:53.411 --> 15:54.400
only time we ever saw her

15:54.496 --> 15:57.909
was... when she wanted to collect
the welfare checks.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.249
- What did she need
the money for?

16:01.336 --> 16:03.668
- Certainly wasn't
to help pay the bills.

16:04.381 --> 16:05.712
So I learned

16:05.799 --> 16:07.835
how to do things on my own.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.085
- And that's when you learned
to steal what you needed.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.015
- There's nothing here to tell
us where Reggie would have gone.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.931
All we have to go on
is this shadow.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.775
Morgan: So we all left one of these
when we disappeared?

16:27.863 --> 16:30.070
- From what I can tell, yeah.

16:30.157 --> 16:31.272
- I was swimming
when it happened,

16:31.366 --> 16:33.527
so I must not have one.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.119
Left without a trace.

16:38.540 --> 16:41.998
I remember how scary it was
for my fiancée when it happened.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.417
One day I was there,
and then...

16:44.504 --> 16:46.745
poof, just gone.

16:48.967 --> 16:49.956
After I thought I'd died,

16:50.051 --> 16:52.212
I followed Amy around
for weeks.

16:53.305 --> 16:55.546
She hardly left the house.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.141
Cried all the time.

16:58.894 --> 17:00.475
All I could do
was just stand there.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.730
I guess that's how we get
haunted houses, huh?

17:05.817 --> 17:08.854
Ghosts lurking
around their old places.

17:08.945 --> 17:11.027
- First place you went
was home.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.103
- Yeah.

17:15.076 --> 17:18.159
- I stayed at the police station
'cause I knew Audrey would come.

17:18.246 --> 17:19.747
- Well, it makes sense.
We tend to gravitate

17:19.831 --> 17:21.617
towards places
we're familiar with.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.825
- Right.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.035
Reggie was a member
of the guard.

17:26.129 --> 17:27.460
It was everything to him.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.663
I bet he's hiding out
at their headquarters.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.339
- Guard headquarters?

17:31.426 --> 17:33.291
Sounds like
a supervillain's lair.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.593
- Yeah, and I bet he knows it
like the back of his hand.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.216
- And you wanna go there?

17:37.307 --> 17:39.639
- There's no choice.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.468
He's not gonna stop
till one of us is dead.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.023
Audrey: We're running out
of time, Seth.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.314
Why don't you just walk
me through how it all works?

17:48.401 --> 17:50.483
- Okay, see these
little guys here?

17:51.988 --> 17:53.524
When these are placed,

17:53.615 --> 17:55.401
they're gonna pick up
the electrical signals

17:55.492 --> 17:58.154
that your body generates
when you speak.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.201
And this console here

18:00.288 --> 18:02.404
is gonna translate
those signals,

18:02.499 --> 18:03.864
basically,

18:03.959 --> 18:07.622
into an audio message,
into something you can hear.

18:07.712 --> 18:10.089
- How are we going
to put those on Nathan?

18:10.173 --> 18:12.255
Won't they just...

18:12.342 --> 18:14.333
- go right through?
- That was very nice.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.712
You just had to jump
right to the problem.

18:15.804 --> 18:17.465
I mean, you couldn't maybe
compliment my ingenuity.

18:17.555 --> 18:18.590
- It's--
- No, no. You're right.

18:18.682 --> 18:22.095
You're right. That is the issue.
I am working on it.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.800
First, I got to test
these things out, though.

18:23.895 --> 18:25.305
- So if you don't mind--
- Whoa!

18:25.397 --> 18:26.887
You know that
I carry a gun, right?

18:26.982 --> 18:28.222
- Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.
- Right here.

18:28.316 --> 18:31.353
- Don't shoot.
I am unarmed and uninsured.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.064
What?

18:38.827 --> 18:40.408
- I pulled a gun on Reggie
in the alley.

18:40.495 --> 18:43.237
He was on his knees, he
put his hands behind his head.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.162
- What are you talking about?
- He wasn't standing like that

18:45.250 --> 18:46.456
when he disappeared.

18:47.836 --> 18:48.825
-So?
- So...

18:50.338 --> 18:51.874
This pic of
the shadow in the alley,

18:51.965 --> 18:53.830
it matches his pose
in this photo.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.461
- So who took the photograph?

18:55.552 --> 18:56.758
- Amy, the photographer.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.920
She's gotta be the Troubled
person that we're looking for,

19:00.015 --> 19:03.303
and we have got to talk her down
before Nathan gets killed.

19:04.102 --> 19:05.091
Amy...

19:05.186 --> 19:08.804
Amy at 44 Dearing Place.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.307
Okay.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.193
- Yeah, I'm coming.

19:19.492 --> 19:24.156
J‘J‘

19:28.793 --> 19:31.000
(whooshing)

19:32.464 --> 19:38.050
J‘J‘

19:45.727 --> 19:47.217
(creaking)

19:49.356 --> 19:53.395
J‘J‘

20:09.501 --> 20:10.490
(gasps)

20:12.504 --> 20:14.460
(door opens)
- Excuse me.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.333
(gaSPS)
- What are you doing?

20:16.591 --> 20:17.580
- Why, hello.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.341
I'm Ron Thigpen.

20:20.428 --> 20:23.511
Features desk, Southern Journal
of Infectious Diseases.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.805
I'm sorry
to catch you off guard,

20:25.892 --> 20:29.009
but Dr. Reynolds asked me
to swing by and grab this.

20:29.104 --> 20:31.720
Thought it might be good
for a feature I'm writing on her.

20:31.815 --> 20:32.930
- A biopsy?

20:33.024 --> 20:34.980
That isn't really
proper protocol.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.104
Dr. Reynolds should know that.

20:37.195 --> 20:38.856
- I'm gonna give her a call.
- Oh!

20:38.947 --> 20:41.984
So you know her?
Well, well, well.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.487
My piece could use
a more personal touch.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.692
(chuckles)

20:45.787 --> 20:47.823
- What publication
do you write for?

20:47.914 --> 20:50.530
- Southern Journal
of Infectious Diseases.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.490
The SJID?

20:52.585 --> 20:53.961
Oh, I'm so sorry.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.912
I left my business cards
in the car.

20:57.006 --> 20:59.748
- Dr. Reynolds
is a consultant at SJID.

20:59.843 --> 21:04.928
Wouldn't a profile on her be
like a conflict of interest?

21:05.014 --> 21:07.300
And wouldn't a
real journalist know that?

21:11.396 --> 21:13.182
(door lock buzzes and beeps)

21:14.941 --> 21:17.057
Nice try,
but I'm calling the cops.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.647
J‘J‘

21:21.990 --> 21:25.198
- Detective Parker, did you get
the pictures I sent you?

21:25.285 --> 21:26.616
- I did, but I'm
going to need to see

21:26.703 --> 21:29.365
all of the pictures from
the farmers' market.

21:29.456 --> 21:31.196
- Yeah, sure.
They're just in here.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.996
Uh, there's not much to show.

21:36.087 --> 21:38.829
I only ever print
my favorite photos.

21:42.927 --> 21:43.916
Here.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.090
- There it is.

21:47.182 --> 21:48.171
Nathan.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.759
- There what is?
What are you talking about?

21:51.853 --> 21:54.890
- Amy, have you... have you ever
heard of the Troubles?

21:58.776 --> 22:00.687
- After your
mother abandoned you...

22:00.820 --> 22:02.026
(bottle thuds)

22:02.113 --> 22:03.398
why didn't you go get help?

22:05.408 --> 22:06.693
- From who?

22:06.784 --> 22:07.773
What-- the state?

22:07.869 --> 22:08.858
(scoffs)

22:10.622 --> 22:15.116
Bouncing around from foster care
to foster care family?

22:15.210 --> 22:16.791
You think I'm screwed up now?

22:16.878 --> 22:18.163
- How did you survive?

22:19.464 --> 22:20.453
(chuckles)

22:25.470 --> 22:27.802
I sold bootleg liquor
under the bleachers

22:27.889 --> 22:30.551
to the other juvenile
delinquents in my school.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.803
And from there, well,
it was just

22:32.894 --> 22:34.805
hop, skip, and
a jump to all of this.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.014
When I was 18, the welfare checks

22:40.109 --> 22:43.317
stopped coming to
the house and...

22:43.404 --> 22:44.610
so did mom.

22:45.448 --> 22:47.905
- Was that the last time
you saw her?

22:47.992 --> 22:48.981
- No.

22:51.079 --> 22:53.445
Just once more.

22:53.540 --> 22:54.529
A few years ago, actually,

22:54.624 --> 22:58.913
l was doing
a drop in Boston...

23:01.548 --> 23:03.664
and I walked around
this corner...

23:06.803 --> 23:08.293
and there she was.

23:10.306 --> 23:12.137
Wanted to score some
dope off me,

23:12.225 --> 23:14.511
but she didn't have any money.

23:14.602 --> 23:16.388
And she said

23:16.479 --> 23:18.970
she'd be happy to pay me
some other way.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.521
She didn't
even recognize me.

23:33.997 --> 23:34.986
- Reggie?

23:36.165 --> 23:37.951
We just want to talk.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.131
I know you blame me
for what's happened.

23:49.679 --> 23:50.668
We can work together.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.137
Solve this Trouble.

23:55.268 --> 23:56.849
We can all go home.

23:58.229 --> 23:59.730
man in distance: Shut up!

24:00.773 --> 24:02.934
(distant thud and groan)

24:05.028 --> 24:06.188
(distant shouting)

24:08.489 --> 24:10.821
J‘J‘

24:11.743 --> 24:13.825
(distant grunting)

24:18.541 --> 24:19.747
- Get away from him!

24:22.670 --> 24:23.955
- Aah!

24:27.050 --> 24:28.381
(grunts)

24:29.636 --> 24:30.921
- This is just a hobby.

24:31.012 --> 24:32.548
I don't take
that many photos.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.095
My camera isn't
even that nice.

24:34.182 --> 24:36.889
- It's not your camera, Amy.
It's you.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.968
When you took pictures of
these people, they disappeared.

24:40.104 --> 24:42.015
We need to figure out what
your Trouble is and fix it

24:42.106 --> 24:43.607
so that we can get them back.

24:43.691 --> 24:45.101
- I'm-I'm sorry.

24:45.193 --> 24:47.024
I-I didn't--

24:49.072 --> 24:50.278
What does that mean?

24:50.365 --> 24:51.730
That wasn't like that before.

24:55.995 --> 24:56.984
- Nathan.

24:57.538 --> 24:59.745
(grunting)

25:01.209 --> 25:02.369
-Ah!

25:04.212 --> 25:05.702
(groaning)

25:07.006 --> 25:08.746
- Okay, who is this guy?

25:10.551 --> 25:11.711
- Just some guy
at the park.

25:11.803 --> 25:13.293
He seemed happy,
so I took his picture.

25:13.388 --> 25:14.798
But he did not look like that.

25:14.889 --> 25:16.595
He did not have blood
on his chest.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.639
- Okay, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.717
That must be
the ghost that was murdered.

25:20.812 --> 25:24.930
So the injuries,
they show up in the photos.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.015
- But that means that...
- Nathan's in Trouble.

25:27.110 --> 25:29.476
Finished or not, Seth,
we need to use that thing.

25:29.570 --> 25:31.185
- No, no.
This is not gonna work

25:31.280 --> 25:33.316
unless it's connected
directly to a subject.

25:33.408 --> 25:34.648
We don't know how
to do that.

25:34.742 --> 25:36.403
I mean, these guys
can't touch anything.

25:36.494 --> 25:38.701
Nathan couldn't even use this
unless somebody actually--

25:40.581 --> 25:42.492
- Oh, no.
- When the people disappeared,

25:42.583 --> 25:44.448
all that was left
was their shadows, right?

25:44.544 --> 25:46.250
There were no cell phones.
There were no wallets.

25:46.337 --> 25:48.123
There was--
there was nothing.

25:52.260 --> 25:53.340
I'm taking this with me.

25:53.428 --> 25:54.793
And my gun.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.003
Okay, take my picture.

25:57.098 --> 25:58.963
- No, no, no-- Wait a second.
Just-just-just-just--

25:59.058 --> 26:01.470
let's wait on second, okay?
'cause this is kind of nuts.

26:01.561 --> 26:04.803
First of all, aren't you immune
to the Troubles?

26:04.897 --> 26:07.639
- Not anymore, but I'm going
to use that to my advantage.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.520
I'm gonna save Nathan.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.316
And I'll use this device
to talk to Amy

26:11.404 --> 26:13.315
and solve the Trouble.

26:13.406 --> 26:14.771
Take my picture.

26:20.371 --> 26:21.360
(sighs)

26:25.126 --> 26:26.115
(beeps)

26:29.672 --> 26:31.037
- This is your fault!

26:31.132 --> 26:33.919
You're the reason
the Trouble's still here.

26:34.010 --> 26:35.216
After I kill you,

26:35.303 --> 26:37.635
I'm gonna cut that ink
out your arm.

26:38.723 --> 26:40.509
(grunting)

26:41.476 --> 26:43.808
(gun fires)

26:46.147 --> 26:48.980
(panting)

26:50.443 --> 26:54.106
J‘J‘

26:57.617 --> 26:58.777
Audrey: Did it work?
- Nothing.

26:58.868 --> 27:00.108
You wanna take
the lens cap off or something?

27:00.203 --> 27:02.569
- No, it is. Look.
What if-what if you're wrong?

27:02.663 --> 27:03.914
What if I'm not Troubled?

27:03.998 --> 27:05.158
- Can you please
just try it again?

27:05.249 --> 27:06.238
- Okay.

27:06.334 --> 27:07.323
(beeping, clicking)

27:08.878 --> 27:09.867
Seth: Crap.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.338
Audrey: Okay, when you took
these photos,

27:11.422 --> 27:12.707
were you thinking of anything?

27:12.799 --> 27:15.882
Did you feel any kind of emotion
towards these people?

27:15.968 --> 27:16.957
- l-l don't know.

27:17.053 --> 27:18.384
- We know it's tied
to the photos.

27:18.471 --> 27:20.837
The question is just this,
why just these exact people?

27:20.932 --> 27:22.797
Why not everybody you've
ever photographed?

27:24.727 --> 27:26.228
- It's time to cash in
on a deal.

27:26.312 --> 27:29.179
(phone ringing)
Duke, we're stuck.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.138
ls Mara ready to talk yet?

27:33.528 --> 27:35.268
- That's right, sheriff,
confirmed with Dr. Reynolds.

27:36.030 --> 27:37.531
Never heard of him.

27:38.533 --> 27:39.522
No rush.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.241
He's not going anywhere.

27:42.328 --> 27:43.613
- Honestly, dear,

27:43.704 --> 27:47.162
this really isn't a big deal.
If we could just--

27:47.250 --> 27:48.786
- Save the story
for your lawyer.

27:48.876 --> 27:49.865
You'll need it.

27:49.961 --> 27:51.246
The crackdown on
prescription drug trafficking

27:51.337 --> 27:53.544
means stealing from hospitals
is now a federal offense.

27:53.631 --> 27:55.622
- This is all a terrible
misunderstanding.

27:55.716 --> 27:57.331
- I understand just fine.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.917
You saw this place and
thought, easy mark.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.094
Backwater clinic,
slack-jawed hillbillies.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.134
But you are going to jail.

28:04.225 --> 28:06.136
And I hope they lock you up
till your teeth fall out.

28:09.272 --> 28:10.762
- If they've got
this device working,

28:10.857 --> 28:12.597
we can share information
with them.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.353
Together, maybe we
can end this Trouble

28:14.443 --> 28:16.775
and reunite you with
your fiancée.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.649
My partner left a note.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.693
"It's the photographer,
Amy Potter.

28:21.784 --> 28:22.990
44 Dearing Place."

28:23.911 --> 28:25.412
- Did you say Amy Potter?

28:26.414 --> 28:27.403
- Yeah, why?

28:29.250 --> 28:30.990
She's your fiancée, isn't she?

28:31.085 --> 28:32.074
- Yeah.

28:32.169 --> 28:34.501
- Troubles usually express
themselves with extreme emotion.

28:34.589 --> 28:38.081
I think Amy finding out her fiancé
had cancer qualifies.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.210
- Amy?

28:39.302 --> 28:41.088
- We can use the device.

28:41.178 --> 28:43.669
You can talk to her,
tell her you're still here.

28:43.764 --> 28:45.015
Maybe then...

28:45.099 --> 28:46.600
- We can be together.

28:46.684 --> 28:47.673
- Let's go.

28:49.270 --> 28:51.977
- All right,
you set the rules.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.895
I shared.
Now, you share.

28:53.983 --> 28:56.065
- I know, but In

28:56.152 --> 28:57.688
I don't know anything

28:57.778 --> 28:59.564
about an atomic shadow trouble.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.189
(sighs)
- Well, there's gotta be something.

29:04.035 --> 29:05.821
Let's start from the top.

29:07.622 --> 29:09.408
A woman takes a photograph.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.748
There's a flash
and then a delay,

29:12.835 --> 29:16.794
and then a person vanishes,
leaving behind a shadow.

29:20.051 --> 29:22.713
- What if the Trouble

29:22.803 --> 29:24.839
evolved over the centuries?

29:24.931 --> 29:27.297
What came before a photograph?

29:27.391 --> 29:28.380
Painting.

29:28.476 --> 29:29.932
- You made a painting Trouble.

29:30.019 --> 29:31.725
- I gave it to an artist.

29:31.812 --> 29:34.349
And when he finished
his portrait,

29:34.440 --> 29:36.897
the subject would disappear.

29:36.984 --> 29:38.815
The body would be trapped
in the painting,

29:38.903 --> 29:41.815
and the soul was
left to haunt the world.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.487
- What about the shadow
that it left behind?

29:46.786 --> 29:49.493
when the painting was
finished, the person would vanish.

29:49.580 --> 29:50.569
- Mm.

29:50.665 --> 29:51.780
- How do you finish
a photograph?

29:55.544 --> 29:56.750
- You print it.

29:58.089 --> 30:03.504
J‘J‘

30:08.224 --> 30:09.509
- Thank you.

30:11.268 --> 30:12.303
- Duke, I don't know
what you had to do,

30:12.395 --> 30:14.386
but... it was worth it.

30:16.190 --> 30:18.181
We have to print the photo.

30:18.526 --> 30:21.233
That's how I cross over.
(device softly clicks)

30:21.320 --> 30:24.278
- Oh, wow. Looks like
your timing's spot on.

30:24.365 --> 30:26.151
(beeping)
Nathan got your note.

30:27.576 --> 30:28.565
He's here.

30:30.037 --> 30:31.117
- Good work, Parker.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.121
Plan works,
we're all going home.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.162
(chuckles)

30:43.634 --> 30:48.048
J‘J‘

30:49.098 --> 30:50.087
That knife.

30:50.725 --> 30:52.056
Morgan.

30:53.394 --> 30:55.726
Morgan: I wish you hadn't seen that.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.812
- Okay, remember,
one on the chest,

30:58.899 --> 31:00.639
one just below the vocal chords.

31:00.735 --> 31:03.147
I'm gonna be back here
running things on this side

31:03.237 --> 31:05.774
and, you know, just
saving the day, as usual.

31:07.742 --> 31:09.073
Are you sure you're ready
for this?

31:11.078 --> 31:13.319
- Yeah...
Let's do this.

31:13.414 --> 31:14.403
- Okay.

31:15.458 --> 31:16.618
H it it.

31:22.131 --> 31:26.170
J‘J‘

31:26.260 --> 31:27.249
(whooshing)

31:28.387 --> 31:30.673
- Ow...
Oh.

31:33.768 --> 31:35.975
Holy crap!
I can't believe that worked.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.142
I mean, I don't wanna sound
like a skeptic,

31:37.229 --> 31:38.480
but that was frickin' amazing.

31:40.775 --> 31:41.764
- Nathan?

31:43.277 --> 31:44.266
Nathan?

31:49.325 --> 31:50.314
Nathan.

31:54.455 --> 31:55.570
Morgan: You shouldn't have come here.

31:58.084 --> 32:03.078
J‘J‘

32:05.216 --> 32:06.205
(knocking)

32:08.969 --> 32:10.254
(beeping)

32:11.388 --> 32:13.879
- Thought you'd get away
with this again, did you?

32:13.974 --> 32:16.351
You slimy old rake.

32:16.435 --> 32:19.268
Think this helpless old man act
is fooling anyone?

32:19.355 --> 32:20.891
- Um, what's going on?

32:20.981 --> 32:23.518
- Police chief Garland Wuornos,
Ma'am.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.816
I see you've already
met the father of lies.

32:27.863 --> 32:29.649
Morgan: Amy.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.196
Amy, can you hear me?

32:31.283 --> 32:33.239
(chuckles excitedly)
- Okay!

32:33.327 --> 32:35.318
- I'm a genius.
- Oh, my god.

32:37.164 --> 32:38.745
Morgan, is that you?

32:38.833 --> 32:40.289
- Yeah. Who is Morgan?

32:40.376 --> 32:42.367
Morgan: Hi-- Yes!
Yes, it's me!

32:43.170 --> 32:45.035
It's me-- I can't
believe I'm talking to you.

32:45.131 --> 32:48.373
- Morgan, it's been so long,
l-l thought you were dead.

32:48.467 --> 32:51.004
- So did I. But listen,
none of that matters now.

32:52.638 --> 32:55.471
- Does-does this mean
I did this to you?

32:55.558 --> 32:57.890
- It's okay, honey.
We can fix this.

32:57.977 --> 33:01.185
Audrey and Nathan are here,
and we've figured out a way.

33:01.272 --> 33:04.105
- Okay. Okay. Yeah, what is it?
I'll do anything.

33:04.191 --> 33:07.854
- Just take a photo of
yourself and then print it out.

33:07.945 --> 33:09.606
That will end your Trouble.

33:09.697 --> 33:10.686
Amy: Okay.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.195
- Okay-- Okay, wait.
Can I just say one thing here?

33:15.286 --> 33:18.369
I know I don't know too much
about Troubles,

33:18.455 --> 33:20.867
but solving them
usually doesn't involve

33:20.958 --> 33:22.744
falling on your own sword.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.253
- Um...
- You heard him.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.077
- We can be together.
- I heard him.

33:27.173 --> 33:30.210
I just don't know why he
didn't let Audrey or Nathan speak.

33:30.301 --> 33:31.461
It doesn't make any sense.

33:31.552 --> 33:32.917
(printer buzzing)
No, no, wait, wait, wait!

33:37.641 --> 33:38.630
Amy: Morgan?

33:39.476 --> 33:40.682
- Amy?
- Oh, Morgan.

33:42.062 --> 33:44.724
Oh, I thought
I'd never see you again.

33:47.401 --> 33:49.392
NEH!

33:49.486 --> 33:51.477
What is this?

33:51.572 --> 33:52.857
Morgan, why are they
in handcuffs?

33:52.948 --> 33:54.904
- Don't trust him, Amy.
He's killed--

33:54.992 --> 33:55.981
- Shut up!

33:58.370 --> 34:01.533
- This old codger isn'tjust
a liar and a thief,

34:01.624 --> 34:02.830
he's a junkie.

34:02.917 --> 34:04.498
woman: Figured.
Dave: Damn right.

34:04.585 --> 34:07.372
Sneaking into hospitals,
stealing whatever drugs

34:07.463 --> 34:09.078
he can lay his hands on,

34:09.173 --> 34:10.834
spitting out whatever lies

34:10.925 --> 34:12.506
will get him what he wants.

34:12.593 --> 34:14.959
What's he this time, pharmacist,
health department?

34:15.054 --> 34:17.386
- Claimed he's a journalist.
- A journalist.

34:17.473 --> 34:19.589
A journalist.
(laughs)

34:20.351 --> 34:24.014
Growing ever
bolder, are we, Frank?

34:24.104 --> 34:25.389
Or is it Henry?

34:25.481 --> 34:26.846
Ah, it doesn't matter.

34:26.941 --> 34:30.274
They've only got one name
for your kind in the hoosegow.

34:30.361 --> 34:31.692
Sugan

34:31.779 --> 34:34.691
You know, he almost killed
his own brother.

34:34.782 --> 34:36.522
Practically
threw him to the dogs.

34:36.617 --> 34:38.107
- Hang on--
- Can it!

34:39.286 --> 34:40.822
Sorry, Miss.

34:40.913 --> 34:44.656
Silver-tongued scoundrels
like this really get my hackles up.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.251
Get your ass up!

34:47.920 --> 34:49.911
Better take this
for evidence.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.290
Thank you kindly, miss.

34:51.382 --> 34:54.624
What were you gonna do,
smoke a tissue sample?

34:54.718 --> 34:56.879
- Damn junkie!
- Get your hands off me!

34:59.556 --> 35:00.716
Amy: Why are you doing this?

35:00.808 --> 35:02.890
- Listen to me for one second.

35:02.977 --> 35:04.217
This was the only way.

35:04.311 --> 35:07.929
He was gonna end this, and I was
gonna go back in my body,

35:08.023 --> 35:09.934
and then...
my cancer.

35:10.901 --> 35:12.402
I can't do that.

35:13.279 --> 35:14.268
But here--

35:15.823 --> 35:17.563
here we could be together.

35:17.658 --> 35:18.864
- But those men.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.366
Morgan, did you--

35:22.371 --> 35:23.360
Nathan: Amy...

35:24.164 --> 35:28.328
his picture that you took
of him on his birthday,

35:28.419 --> 35:30.785
that's the man
you wanted to be with.

35:30.879 --> 35:32.540
That was his last birthday

35:32.631 --> 35:36.044
right before he found out
he had cancer.

35:36.135 --> 35:37.124
- Yes.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.172
Morgan, how
could you do this?

35:40.264 --> 35:42.596
- Amy, don't listen to them.
Audrey: You wanted so badly

35:42.683 --> 35:44.799
to keep him like that,

35:44.893 --> 35:46.929
to capture that exact moment.

35:48.188 --> 35:50.053
- That's when your Trouble--
- Shut up!

35:50.149 --> 35:52.265
- But he's not that man, all right?
He's gone.

35:52.359 --> 35:53.860
- I am not gone!

35:54.903 --> 35:56.109
I'm right here!

35:57.031 --> 35:58.020
- No.

35:58.699 --> 35:59.859
No, they're right.

36:01.368 --> 36:02.869
You killed those people.

36:04.747 --> 36:08.581
The Morgan I wanted to marry,
he never would have done that.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.578
You are not the man
in that picture,

36:10.669 --> 36:11.658
not anymore.

36:13.714 --> 36:15.454
That man died
a long time ago.

36:16.216 --> 36:17.752
(whooshing)

36:24.516 --> 36:25.722
Audrey: What happened?

36:27.061 --> 36:28.767
- We're back.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.685
- Why couldn't you
leave us alone?

36:30.773 --> 36:33.560
Why do you guys get
to be together and we can't?

36:33.650 --> 36:36.232
Why are you the only one
that gets to be happy?

36:38.781 --> 36:38.985
J‘J‘

36:38.989 --> 36:40.980
J‘J‘

36:41.075 --> 36:43.111
- You show up here
saying you'll fix everything,

36:43.202 --> 36:44.408
but you ruin it all!

36:44.495 --> 36:45.484
- Morgan, no!

36:47.206 --> 36:48.195
(thuds)

36:49.249 --> 36:51.535
(Seth panting)

36:54.213 --> 36:56.955
- I... am the one...

36:57.049 --> 36:58.789
who goes bump in the night.

36:58.884 --> 36:59.873
(tripod thuds)

36:59.968 --> 37:01.174
Huh?

37:01.261 --> 37:02.546
No? That's not working?

37:02.638 --> 37:03.878
Okay, stay there.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.428
I got another one.
Let me try that again.

37:10.687 --> 37:12.552
- The EMTs say
it won't be long,

37:12.648 --> 37:14.980
just a matter of making
him comfortable.

37:15.359 --> 37:17.645
- I'm sorry.
That must be really hard to hear.

37:17.736 --> 37:20.022
- I thought I lost Morgan
a long time ago,

37:20.114 --> 37:22.070
but I really lost him today.

37:23.117 --> 37:24.698
I guess I never
really let him go.

37:26.829 --> 37:28.490
I don't know that man.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.569
He hurt people.

37:29.665 --> 37:32.828
He... killed people
just so we could be together.

37:34.545 --> 37:36.331
That man is not Morgan.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.714
- Okay, guys, there's something
we seriously need to discuss.

37:45.347 --> 37:47.133
Did you see the way
I took that guy out?

37:47.224 --> 37:48.464
It was just like a...
Pow!

37:49.935 --> 37:51.220
Honestly, I don't
know how you do this.

37:51.311 --> 37:53.563
The stress alone
is just crazy.

37:53.647 --> 37:54.727
- You know you loved it.

37:54.815 --> 37:57.397
- Yeah, maybe.
But I bet I'm not the only one.

37:57.484 --> 37:59.861
Anyhoo, crisis averted,

37:59.945 --> 38:01.276
day saved,

38:01.363 --> 38:04.480
guess I'll... head out
while I'm still on top.

38:05.534 --> 38:06.990
- Seth, thank you.

38:07.077 --> 38:08.658
- You kidding me?
Thank you.

38:08.745 --> 38:12.078
This has been yet
another revealing trip to Haven.

38:12.166 --> 38:13.155
You know, I had some doubts

38:13.250 --> 38:14.740
about working
without my partner,

38:14.835 --> 38:18.828
but I learned that I can
still do this,

38:18.922 --> 38:19.911
even on my own.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.835
Next time, who knows?

38:24.261 --> 38:25.671
I'll see ya.

38:31.852 --> 38:32.841
(chuckles lightly)

38:32.936 --> 38:36.645
J‘J‘

38:39.860 --> 38:41.020
- What Amy said...

38:43.071 --> 38:44.811
Is that what I'm doing?

38:44.907 --> 38:46.443
Hurting people to
be with you?

38:47.826 --> 38:48.815
- No.

38:51.705 --> 38:53.787
Just today,
you brought back everyone

38:53.874 --> 38:55.865
that was affected
by Amy's Trouble.

38:56.460 --> 38:57.449
It's because of you

38:57.544 --> 39:00.536
that they can be back
with their families again.

39:00.631 --> 39:04.624
I mean, after everything that
we have been through

39:04.718 --> 39:06.754
and everything
that we have sacrificed...

39:10.516 --> 39:12.381
We deserve to be together.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.733
- Let's go home.

39:25.113 --> 39:26.614
man: Yeah, we're clear on this side.

39:27.199 --> 39:29.815
Duke: I hate to say it, but...

39:29.910 --> 39:32.401
you may have saved Nathan's life today.
(Mara lightly snorts)

39:33.455 --> 39:34.535
- You couldn't hate saying it

39:34.623 --> 39:38.241
more than I hate hearing it.

39:38.335 --> 39:39.575
(chuckles)

39:39.670 --> 39:43.162
- So now that Nathan's
all back

39:43.257 --> 39:45.088
safe and sound...

39:46.260 --> 39:47.841
why am I here, Duke?

39:48.804 --> 39:50.214
- Well, I'm not gonna
throw you off my boat.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.557
You still got half a glass.

39:52.641 --> 39:54.006
It's expensive bourbon.

39:54.101 --> 39:56.387
- That's not what I mean.

39:56.478 --> 39:57.763
I've been thinking

39:57.854 --> 40:01.221
about when you used
that Trouble on me.

40:01.316 --> 40:04.308
Why didn't you just
put Audrey back in control?

40:05.779 --> 40:07.610
You split us in two.

40:09.741 --> 40:10.730
- Believe me...

40:11.451 --> 40:12.952
it was an accident.

40:13.370 --> 40:14.860
- Oh, no.

40:14.955 --> 40:16.445
Remember who
you're talking to.

40:18.959 --> 40:21.621
I know how
venting a Trouble works.

40:22.879 --> 40:25.461
The most important aspect
being intent.

40:26.925 --> 40:29.541
You split us because
you wanted Audrey back,

40:29.636 --> 40:31.922
but at least subconsciously...

40:32.889 --> 40:35.301
you wanted me around too.

40:35.392 --> 40:37.804
And so my question for
you, Duke, is...

40:39.896 --> 40:40.885
Why?

40:42.482 --> 40:45.690
J‘J‘

40:47.863 --> 40:51.105
- Here's to Haven, its secrets
safe for another day.

40:51.199 --> 40:54.032
- Bugger that.
Here's to your performance.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.825
- I'll drink to that, sugar.

40:55.912 --> 40:57.573
(laughing)

40:59.541 --> 41:02.408
I really thought
I was headed for the clink.

41:02.502 --> 41:04.288
What made you come back?

41:05.422 --> 41:07.083
- I'm sorry for running out
on you, Vincent,

41:07.174 --> 41:09.916
but... I was scared.

41:10.010 --> 41:10.999
- Scared of what?

41:12.012 --> 41:15.800
- Well, what that sample
represents.

41:16.975 --> 41:20.183
The thinny,
the visions, the lost time,

41:20.270 --> 41:21.259
Croatoan.

41:22.689 --> 41:24.429
It's a reminder.

41:24.524 --> 41:25.775
I'm part of it.

41:25.859 --> 41:29.101
Whatever role
I have to play in it all, it...

41:29.196 --> 41:30.936
- it terrifies me.
- Well...

41:32.366 --> 41:35.108
l was treating you
like a piece of the puzzle and...

41:35.202 --> 41:36.282
not like a brother.

41:38.163 --> 41:39.778
Come what may,

41:39.873 --> 41:41.613
we'll face it together.

41:41.708 --> 41:43.244
- Come what may.

41:43.335 --> 41:45.576
But for now,
here's to the Teagues.

41:45.671 --> 41:47.536
Haven's protectors.

41:47.631 --> 41:49.292
- And I will drink to that.

41:51.134 --> 41:53.921
J‘J‘

41:54.012 --> 41:55.513
The CDC.

41:55.597 --> 41:57.804
Oh, no.

42:06.191 --> 42:07.180
- Vince Teagues?

42:09.152 --> 42:11.404
Vince: Can I help you?
- Dr. Charlotte Cross.

42:11.488 --> 42:13.479
Centers for Disease Control.

42:13.573 --> 42:15.188
I'm looking for your
brother Dave.

42:15.283 --> 42:16.944
- Um, he's upstate.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.862
Feature story,
a three-clawed lobster.

42:20.956 --> 42:21.945
(chuckles)

42:22.624 --> 42:23.830
Is everything okay?

42:25.127 --> 42:26.867
- That's what I'm hoping
to find out.

42:29.756 --> 42:29.790
J‘J‘

42:29.798 --> 42:33.086
J‘J‘
