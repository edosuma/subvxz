WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:03.637
- A Pop original series.

00:04.772 --> 00:07.741
[energetic brass music]

00:07.775 --> 00:10.311
*

00:10.344 --> 00:12.780
- I was going for a younger,
sexier, Vincent Price.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.282
- Okay, shut it.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.416
As much as I'd love
to talk about

00:15.449 --> 00:16.684
our wonderful show tonight--

00:16.717 --> 00:18.519
[sighs]
Whoopi Goldberg, Denis Leary,

00:18.552 --> 00:21.355
the amazing ventriloquist,
Jonathan Geffner,

00:21.389 --> 00:23.524
I actually have something
very serious

00:23.557 --> 00:26.794
and pressing
and somewhat urgent to discuss.

00:26.827 --> 00:30.398
- You finally got laid?
[laughter]

00:30.431 --> 00:32.433
- [laughs mockingly]
There's been an outbreak.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.102
- How serious of an outbreak?

00:34.135 --> 00:36.804
'Cause if it gets bad,
I do have cyanide pills

00:36.837 --> 00:38.806
in my desk drawer.
They are chewable,

00:38.839 --> 00:40.508
Very hard to find
on the deep web.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.077
- Absolutely it sounds extreme,
but it is the cleanest

00:43.111 --> 00:44.745
and easiest way to die.
- Okay.

00:44.778 --> 00:48.082
Everybody can kill themselves
during hiatus.

00:48.116 --> 00:50.118
The reason I look
a little glum

00:50.151 --> 00:51.819
is because we have
a lice outbreak.

00:51.852 --> 00:54.422
[all groaning]
All right, all right!

00:54.455 --> 00:56.390
It's not Ebola!

00:56.424 --> 00:58.326
[exhales]
But you all need to be treated.

00:58.359 --> 00:59.693
- Well, you might want
to start off with Marcus

00:59.727 --> 01:01.495
because his children
had lice all week.

01:01.529 --> 01:02.830
- You bitch!
- Dude!

01:02.863 --> 01:04.232
- What?
- That was a secret.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.500
- Marcus, patient zero!
- How dare you!

01:06.534 --> 01:08.369
- Don't worry,
the Lice Fairy is here.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.870
- Excuse me?
What did you call me?

01:09.903 --> 01:12.106
- The Jamaican ladies
to treat all of our scalps!

01:12.140 --> 01:13.407
- Oh, gotcha.

01:13.441 --> 01:16.244
- Um, I've had
two very bad experiences

01:16.277 --> 01:17.845
with Jamaican ladies
touching me.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.747
- This place is disgusting.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.216
I'd always knew I'd end up
getting something working here.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.152
- Which is why we all
need to be treated.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.554
- All right,
I have a time schedule

01:26.587 --> 01:28.822
of when everyone is going to
visit the Lice Fairy,

01:28.856 --> 01:30.491
so please see me after.

01:30.524 --> 01:33.161
- Yeah,
I think I see one.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.362
- What? Get it.

01:34.395 --> 01:35.563
- Kill him. Kill him!

01:35.596 --> 01:37.531
- Get it!
- [whimpers]

01:37.565 --> 01:40.501
[grunting, screaming]

01:42.870 --> 01:44.305
I got it.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.706
- From Studio 9B

01:45.739 --> 01:48.142
in the heart of New York City,

01:48.176 --> 01:50.611
it's "Nightcap with Jimmy."

01:50.644 --> 01:52.580
Tonight, we're
"Makin' Whoopee"

01:52.613 --> 01:55.249
with Whoopi Goldberg.

01:55.283 --> 01:59.287
Lovable Masshole Denis Leary.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.255
Renowned Jewish ventriloquist

02:01.289 --> 02:03.457
Jonathan Geffner.

02:03.491 --> 02:06.427
And now, the man who's
number five in the ratings,

02:06.460 --> 02:08.329
but number one in our hearts,

02:08.362 --> 02:10.664
here's Jimmy!

02:10.698 --> 02:14.668
*

02:14.702 --> 02:16.370
- We are in this small,
cramped room

02:16.404 --> 02:17.738
[whispers]
Because we have lice

02:17.771 --> 02:19.440
and nobody can
find out about it.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.874
We need to be quiet.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.810
Like Anne Frank quiet.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.678
- Yeah, yeah,
you got it bad.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.514
- I knew it.
- You know, if she has it,

02:26.547 --> 02:27.881
I probably have it
'cause I fell asleep

02:27.915 --> 02:29.917
in her lap last night
watching "Cupcake Wars."

02:29.950 --> 02:32.586
[all aww]
- Boy, that is sweet.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.688
And how long you all
been together for?

02:34.722 --> 02:36.557
- 2 years, 1 month,
13 days.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.492
- Oh. [chuckles]
- Oh, but...

02:38.526 --> 02:40.428
we're not--
we're not a couple.

02:40.461 --> 02:43.431
We don't...
- Oh.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.765
- Hey, you know,
when I was a kid,

02:44.798 --> 02:46.300
um, every time I had lice,

02:46.334 --> 02:47.768
my dad would soak my head
in kerosene.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.371
- I think it may have killed
more than just the lice.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.839
- In your medical opinion,

02:51.872 --> 02:54.342
uh, that treatment,
does it also...

02:54.375 --> 02:56.310
treat down here?

02:57.945 --> 02:59.513
My pubes?

02:59.547 --> 03:03.351
[lively music]

03:03.384 --> 03:04.818
- Oh, my God.
It's even worse than I thought.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.521
- I actually think
I look kind of hot.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.557
- I've never felt
so tough.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.425
- You all look hideous.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.261
- This is all your fault.
- Allegedly.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.662
- You guys don't get it.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.630
We are the fifth-rated
late night talk show.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.299
People find out
we have lice, that's it.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.333
We're done.
We're cancelled.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.901
- You're screwed.

03:20.934 --> 03:21.969
- It kind of looks like
we just got back

03:22.002 --> 03:23.637
from the Caribbean.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.339
- That's it.
That's what we're gonna say.

03:25.373 --> 03:26.907
We just got back
from the Caribbean.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.642
Don't tell Whoopi we have lice.

03:28.676 --> 03:29.943
- I can't wait
to get my cornrows.

03:29.977 --> 03:33.681
I have the perfect
facial structure for it.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.449
Sorry, Randy.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.651
And Penny.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.453
And Staci.
- I'm good.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.021
- Ehh...
- I'm cute.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.023
- [high-pitch] Ehh...
- Pretty.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.892
- [higher-pitched] Ehh...

03:44.925 --> 03:47.595
*

03:47.628 --> 03:48.862
- No, you can't.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.665
Because you can't cancel
the day of.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.967
Because people don't--
- Hey, Staci.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.903
I don't care!
He has to be on the sh--

03:55.936 --> 03:57.338
- Staci!

03:57.371 --> 03:59.607
- Maggie, hold on a second.
What, Todd?

03:59.640 --> 04:01.041
- Oh, uh, do you know where
Jimmy's peanut butter is?

04:01.074 --> 04:02.676
- No, I don't know where
Jimmy's peanut butter is.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.612
- Well, okay, well,
he told me to ask you

04:04.645 --> 04:06.314
'cause you know
where everything is.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.582
- Maggie, listen to me.
I understand that he's sick,

04:08.616 --> 04:10.451
but you cannot cancel--

04:10.484 --> 04:11.652
Maggie!

04:11.685 --> 04:13.521
[shouts]
Maggie!

04:13.554 --> 04:15.423
Oh!
- Is Denis Leary sick?

04:15.456 --> 04:16.857
- Well, his manager
says he is.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.726
- No! God!
Jimmy loves Denis!

04:18.759 --> 04:20.361
We got to get
Denis Leary on the show!

04:20.394 --> 04:21.929
- I know!
- All right, well,

04:21.962 --> 04:23.464
Jimmy didn't prepare anything,
'cause, you know

04:23.497 --> 04:24.898
he can always wing it
with Denis, so...

04:24.932 --> 04:26.667
- That's implying he usually
does prepare

04:26.700 --> 04:29.337
for his interviews?
- No, he doesn't. [laughs]

04:29.370 --> 04:30.604
So you don't know
where the peanut butter is?

04:30.638 --> 04:32.340
- Oh!
Check his bottom drawer!

04:32.373 --> 04:34.575
- Bottom drawer.
God, yes!

04:34.608 --> 04:36.477
- Oh, my God,
I can feel them hatching.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.446
- Oh, God, the Lice Fairy
is still here.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.416
- Ugh!

04:42.450 --> 04:43.784
Hey, um,

04:43.817 --> 04:45.919
you--you know where
the ventriloquist

04:45.953 --> 04:47.755
put the puppet thing?

04:47.788 --> 04:50.391
- Oh, you mean Ezra?

04:50.424 --> 04:52.793
He's not technically a puppet,

04:52.826 --> 04:55.763
he's a dummy
and he's in dressing room #3.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.731
Did you want to meet him?
- No!

04:57.765 --> 04:59.567
Nope. Nope. Nope.
Nope. Nope.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.602
He doesn't have access
to the whole building, right?

05:01.635 --> 05:03.904
- Oh, well, he is a guest,

05:03.937 --> 05:05.839
but he's not a person,

05:05.873 --> 05:07.841
but he lives in a suitcase.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.710
- The suitcase has locks
on it, right?

05:09.743 --> 05:11.979
So he--he can't get out.
- I don't think so.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.347
Why?

05:13.381 --> 05:14.648
- [scoffs]
No reason.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.617
It's just, you know,
I don't want...

05:16.650 --> 05:18.386
to surprise him.
I don't want him...

05:18.419 --> 05:19.553
to surprise me.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.522
You know,
it's just one of th--

05:24.458 --> 05:26.494
Just one of those things.
You know what I mean?

05:26.527 --> 05:32.900
*

05:32.933 --> 05:35.135
- Oh, Whoopi.
Big fan.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.004
- Thanks.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.706
I think.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.408
- Oh, Whoopi Goldberg,
we are so excited

05:40.441 --> 05:41.509
to have you
on the show.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.877
- Okay, so is this

05:43.911 --> 05:46.046
some sort of...
diversity thing?

05:46.079 --> 05:48.015
To make me feel
more comfortable

05:48.048 --> 05:49.617
being black and everything?

05:49.650 --> 05:51.719
- No, no, no, no, no.
#BlackLivesMatter.

05:51.752 --> 05:54.455
Um, no, we were on
a company cruise.

05:54.488 --> 05:57.024
- You know that doesn't make
this any less racist?

05:57.057 --> 05:58.726
Right?

05:58.759 --> 06:01.061
- Can I offer you guys
some freshly-sliced watermelon?

06:01.094 --> 06:02.996
- Don't mind if I do.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.865
- Fresh watermelon,
Ms. Whoopi?

06:04.898 --> 06:08.168
- Sure. 'Cause who
doesn't like watermelon?

06:08.201 --> 06:09.903
- Mm-hmm.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.672
- You know, I gotta tell you,
this is really

06:11.705 --> 06:13.541
making me
a little uncomfortable.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.409
I just feel like
maybe "Nightcap"

06:15.443 --> 06:16.777
is not the place I should be.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.779
- No, no, no, no, no,
Whoopi.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.782
Please don't walk out.
- I gotta think about this.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.518
Do you think we could
take the watermelon to my room?

06:24.552 --> 06:25.986
- Yes!
- A safer environment.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.421
Absolutely.
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:27.455 --> 06:28.656
- Let's go.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.491
I've always felt
this show was racist.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.725
- [strained] Grady!
- I know.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.594
- [exhales sharply]

06:33.627 --> 06:34.995
- Well, this is a pickle.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.064
- Listen to me,
if we lose Whoopi--

06:37.097 --> 06:39.099
we've already lost Denis Leary
because he's sick,

06:39.132 --> 06:41.702
we're gonna have 40 minutes
of a ventriloquist.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.737
- But the ventriloquist
is so good.

06:43.771 --> 06:46.607
- Not for 40 minutes.
[phone dings]

06:46.640 --> 06:48.676
What?
Did you see your reflection?

06:48.709 --> 06:50.478
- Whoa.
No, no, no.

06:50.511 --> 06:53.146
So my friend who works
on Denis' show

06:53.180 --> 06:56.817
said that Denis
is at work today and looks fine.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.887
- You have a friend?
- She's an online friend.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.223
She says that he also baked
banana bread for the crew.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.993
- Asshole!
You know what?

07:06.026 --> 07:08.161
I'm gonna go down
to Denis Leary's set

07:08.195 --> 07:11.899
and I'm gonna grab his flat,
pale, potato eating, Irish ass

07:11.932 --> 07:13.834
and I'm gonna bring it
back to our show.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.770
And I'm not talking like this
'cause I got cornrows.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.672
*

07:20.708 --> 07:23.644
[energetic brass music]

07:23.677 --> 07:25.112
*

07:27.981 --> 07:30.684
- Jesus.
[panting]

07:30.718 --> 07:32.620
- Let me guess,
you're scared of Ezra.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.954
I've seen it before.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.656
- [stammers]
Is he drinking coffee?

07:35.689 --> 07:36.857
- Oh, it's better
for our relationship

07:36.890 --> 07:38.626
if I treat him
like a person.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.528
- Oh.
- Nothing to be scared of.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.663
He's a nice guy.
Want to touch him?

07:42.696 --> 07:43.964
- Nah, I don't want
to touch him.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.799
- Hey, it's okay.
You can touch me.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.735
I don't mind at all.

07:47.768 --> 07:51.104
- What?
- Hey, where you going?

07:51.138 --> 07:58.078
*

08:04.752 --> 08:07.688
- [retching]

08:09.289 --> 08:11.725
- Staci!
Are you okay?

08:11.759 --> 08:13.594
- Oh, my God, Penny,
what are you doing here?

08:13.627 --> 08:15.763
- I thought you might need
emotional support.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.264
You just ran out of there
so quickly

08:17.297 --> 08:19.767
and my natural instinct
was to follow you.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.602
Is that wrong?
- No.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.303
Well, yes and no.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.905
Look,
I know Denis Leary's trailer

08:24.938 --> 08:26.740
is around here somewhere.
I'm trying to find it.

08:26.774 --> 08:28.175
- Oh, I know where he is!

08:28.208 --> 08:30.611
My friend told me
he's around the corner.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.812
Go get him, tiger!

08:31.845 --> 08:33.113
- Copy that.

08:33.146 --> 08:35.749
- You tell them that
the situation's changed.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.818
Oh, fuck.
God damn it.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.019
What?
- Oh, fucking Leary.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.253
- What?
- Oh, my God, look at your hair.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.755
- I can't believe you
came down here.

08:41.789 --> 08:42.990
Look at your hair.
What are you talking about?

08:43.023 --> 08:44.291
This is for a part.
What's that for?

08:44.324 --> 08:45.793
- I came down here--
- I'm acting.

08:45.826 --> 08:46.860
- I'm an actor.
- You cancelled on me

08:46.894 --> 08:48.295
the day of the shoot!

08:48.328 --> 08:50.230
- Okay, well--well--
because I'm sick.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.032
So, that's--
- Denis, we go way back, man.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.201
You've done the show
a million times.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.170
Don't be such a Hollywood guy,
be honest with me.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.840
Come on, we're--
- Listen, I'm sick, okay?

08:59.873 --> 09:01.775
I'm fuckin' sick
and I-I shouldn't even be

09:01.809 --> 09:03.677
on my own set,
but I'm doing it because

09:03.711 --> 09:05.613
I have to be here to--you know,
'cause it's a budget thing.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.180
So, like I said,
if I were you,

09:07.214 --> 09:10.183
I'd back off.
- What, sweetheart?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.586
- I just have your tickets
for tonight's hockey game.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.022
- Are you kidding me?

09:15.055 --> 09:17.057
The Bruins-Rangers game?
Tonight at 7:00?

09:17.090 --> 09:18.992
- Can I explain something?
- You mother...

09:19.026 --> 09:20.761
- Let me explain something
to you,

09:20.794 --> 09:23.296
this--this is--
I'm not sick.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.799
I don't--I don't like to brag
about my charity stuff.

09:25.833 --> 09:29.069
So what I'm doing is
I'm taking a couple of sick kids

09:29.102 --> 09:31.104
to the--I am.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.306
I'm taking sick kids
to the--they're not gonna die,

09:33.340 --> 09:35.042
but they're very sick
and--and they're--

09:35.075 --> 09:37.044
you know, their house--
they have lupus.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.746
They can't--
They can't have ice cream,

09:38.779 --> 09:40.080
they can't eat hotdogs,
it's like--

09:40.113 --> 09:41.381
you know what I mean?
It's a big thing.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.784
- You can't eat pork
if you have lupus?

09:43.817 --> 09:45.118
- I don't think you can eat--
there's certain things

09:45.152 --> 09:46.353
you can't eat. Yeah.
I mean, I don't know

09:46.386 --> 09:48.021
everything about it,
I'm just--Listen,

09:48.055 --> 09:49.990
I don't like to brag about it,
so I said I was sick,

09:50.023 --> 09:51.224
I didn't want to mention
sick kids.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.926
- All right,
so it's at 7:00, okay?

09:52.960 --> 09:54.895
You can still--
You can still do our show

09:54.928 --> 09:57.297
and make it there by 7:00.
- Yes, but...

09:57.330 --> 10:00.100
there's a...
pre-game skate.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.802
Which is--
- You're gonna skate

10:01.835 --> 10:04.004
with the lupus kids?
- It's a lupus, uh...

10:04.037 --> 10:05.906
related skate.
- Okay, you know what, Denis?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.875
- And that's at 6:00.
- You're a grown man.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.377
So why don't we just say,
you do the show,

10:10.410 --> 10:11.912
you'll be there by 7:00.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.046
You can bring
all the sick kids

10:13.080 --> 10:14.848
with you to the show.
Okay?

10:14.882 --> 10:16.884
- I-I'm not sure the sick kids
will want to come to the show.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.251
[stammers]
- All right, well,

10:18.285 --> 10:20.220
you can meet them at the rink.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.756
Please.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.224
- All right, I'll do it.
- You will?

10:24.257 --> 10:25.859
- I'll do it. Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

10:25.893 --> 10:27.260
- All right.
- Oh, my God, you're the best.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.929
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.898
If you weren't married...
- All right, if--

10:30.931 --> 10:33.233
Well, I'm very married,
so...Yeah.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.302
All right.

10:35.335 --> 10:39.372
"Nightcap" fuckin'
piece of shit that show is.

10:39.406 --> 10:42.309
- I got him.
- Yay, that's such good news.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.878
And I have
some good news too.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.814
I got us a ride back
to the studio.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.749
- [gasps]
Oh, my gosh, Penny!

10:48.782 --> 10:51.184
This is so fun.

10:51.218 --> 10:54.054
Oh!
- And I also got us

10:54.087 --> 10:57.324
an Edible Arrangement
to nibble on.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.093
- I feel like
I'm in a Nora Ephron movie.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.896
[jazzy music]

11:02.930 --> 11:05.699
- All set.
You are mic'd.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.100
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.703
Oh, and I'm not a racist.
- Okay.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.939
- Hey, Whoopi!
[laughs]

11:11.972 --> 11:14.875
It's Todd.
We met on, uh...

11:14.908 --> 11:17.177
I'm Jimmy's friend.
Yeah, and producer.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.279
- That's sort of accurate.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.915
- Is she all mic'd up?
- Yeah, she's mic'd.

11:21.949 --> 11:24.317
- Dude, nice.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.254
- Okay, good luck, Whoop.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.322
- Touch that tail.
- Do not touch my nipples.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.058
- I always think
he's gonna hit me.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.060
Oh, he never does.
Uh, hey, Whoops,

11:33.093 --> 11:35.996
would you mind--
could you sign my copy

11:36.029 --> 11:37.831
of "Jumpin' Jack Flash"?

11:37.865 --> 11:40.167
It's me and Jimmy's favorite.
We watch it all the time.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.803
- Sure.
- Ah, thank you so much.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.337
- This a bootleg?
- Yeah, I got it

11:44.371 --> 11:46.306
from a Chinese guy
down on Canal Street.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.375
- Nice.
- Nice. Yeah, no offense.

11:48.408 --> 11:49.877
I just--
- No, no, it's cool.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.444
They don't pay me.
- Yeah, right.

11:51.478 --> 11:54.181
- Cool.
- Ah, cool!

11:54.214 --> 11:57.250
[sighs]
- So, Todd...

11:57.284 --> 11:59.820
- Yeah?
- What's up with your hair?

11:59.853 --> 12:02.455
- I think we may have lice.
- [chuckles]

12:02.489 --> 12:04.024
- Yeah.
- You're serious?

12:04.057 --> 12:06.159
- Yeah, who knows, you know?
[grumbles]

12:06.193 --> 12:08.128
They're all over the place.
- So right now,

12:08.161 --> 12:09.963
while we're talking,
lice could be jumpin'...

12:09.997 --> 12:12.099
from you to me?
- No! No, no!

12:12.132 --> 12:13.333
I work upstairs
with Jimmy.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.902
No, upstairs is totally clean.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.037
Yeah, I'm all good,
but down here is probably

12:17.070 --> 12:20.540
infested with them, so
I'm getting the hell outta here.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.543
[energetic brass music]

12:23.576 --> 12:25.846
*

12:25.879 --> 12:27.114
- Oh, my God,
look at you guys.

12:27.147 --> 12:28.882
- What?

12:28.916 --> 12:30.517
- Listen, you go deal with
the ventriloquist,

12:30.550 --> 12:32.152
I'll deal with Whoopi.
- I'm on it.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.086
Should we high-five?
- No.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.154
- Okay.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.189
*

12:36.223 --> 12:38.158
- Oh, hey, Todd.
- Hey.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.460
- I just met Ezra.
He's wonderful.

12:40.493 --> 12:43.463
Have you met him?
- Yeah, he drinks coffee!

12:43.496 --> 12:45.899
Can I tell you a secret?
- Yes!

12:45.933 --> 12:47.968
You tell me one,
then I'll tell you one.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.436
- Nah, that's okay,
I just want to tell you mine.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.805
- Oh.
- I'm afraid of puppets.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.874
- Why?
- You ever see that movie

12:53.907 --> 12:56.043
"Magic"
with Anthony Hopkins?

12:56.076 --> 12:57.444
It's one of Jimmy's
favorite movies.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.112
He brings me over
all the time to watch it.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.214
- Does he know you're afraid?
- Yes!

13:01.248 --> 13:03.083
- Do you cry?
- Yes!

13:03.116 --> 13:05.118
- Wait, Jimmy thinks it's funny
when you cry?

13:05.152 --> 13:07.220
- Yeah, I make him laugh,
you know?

13:07.254 --> 13:09.456
I am to him
what he is to America.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.158
- You know, Todd,
I used to have

13:11.191 --> 13:13.126
a debilitating fear
of goats

13:13.160 --> 13:14.895
all throughout
my childhood.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.163
It was bad.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.465
So I finally tried
immersion therapy.

13:18.498 --> 13:22.269
My mom locked me
in a pen with goats overnight.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.104
You know,
just me and the goats?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.572
It worked.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.475
I woke up the next day
and I wasn't afraid of goats,

13:28.508 --> 13:31.011
and I finally saw them
for what they are.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.913
- Goats?
- Yeah.

13:32.946 --> 13:37.050
Not evil, horned monster
creatures.

13:37.084 --> 13:39.987
Just goats.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.189
[giggles]

13:42.222 --> 13:44.124
- Hey, have you seen
Jimmy's peanut butter?

13:45.625 --> 13:47.928
- Um...
no, I haven't.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.429
- [clicks tongue]

13:52.399 --> 13:55.202
*

13:55.235 --> 13:56.937
- That's fine.
I'll call Kerry Washington

13:56.970 --> 13:59.106
I don't give a shit.
What are you doing here?

13:59.139 --> 14:02.375
- Hmm, well,
I was meditating,

14:02.409 --> 14:05.345
but I also figured that
you'd like an update on Whoopi.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.614
- What is she doing?
Is she still here?

14:07.647 --> 14:09.249
- Oh, well,
she's asking questions,

14:09.282 --> 14:11.518
but I did my best
to keep her here

14:11.551 --> 14:13.453
and, uh--
- All right, guys, listen to me,

14:13.486 --> 14:15.622
this is--this is probably
the biggest thing

14:15.655 --> 14:17.958
I've had to face thus far
in my career.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.527
Do we want to be known
as a racist show

14:20.560 --> 14:22.529
or a show
that's gonna be know for

14:22.562 --> 14:24.031
having a lice infestation?

14:24.064 --> 14:26.299
- Okay, but we deal
with celebrities

14:26.333 --> 14:28.301
and celebrities are whores--
we all know that,

14:28.335 --> 14:29.636
and we all know,
very well,

14:29.669 --> 14:31.371
that when it comes to
self-promotion,

14:31.404 --> 14:33.440
people can look beyond
racism in a heartbeat.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.308
- Okay,
on the count of three,

14:35.342 --> 14:37.177
you say which you think
is worse.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.546
Racism
or lice infestation.

14:39.579 --> 14:40.981
Are you ready?

14:41.014 --> 14:42.382
One, two, three.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.051
- Lice.
- Strep throat.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.385
- Strep throat?

14:45.418 --> 14:47.487
- Um,
I think I'm getting it.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.456
- It's also contagious.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.196
- That's a tough call.
- Uh, excuse me, white devils.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.198
What is this I hear about
the "Nightcap" staff

14:58.231 --> 15:01.068
being racist now?
- Jesus, word travels fast.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.369
- I'm a publicist.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.971
I'm the one
that word travels to;

15:04.004 --> 15:06.339
and, yes, it travels fast
because I'm good.

15:06.373 --> 15:10.010
I'm also black.
Did you know I was black, Staci?

15:10.043 --> 15:11.444
- I knew you were a publicist.

15:11.478 --> 15:13.213
- Don't get cute with me now.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.082
Is that what these ridiculous
cornrows are about?

15:15.115 --> 15:16.449
- No, no, no.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.118
We went on a vacation
in the Caribbean and we--

15:18.151 --> 15:20.120
- When did you go on a vacation
to the Caribbean?

15:20.153 --> 15:21.621
You look whiter than ever.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.091
Do you ever want another
black person on this show?

15:24.124 --> 15:27.160
Lupita Nyong'o,
Jamie Foxx, Al Roker.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.562
- I don't want Al Roker.
- Nobody wants Al Roker.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.064
- Malik, why are you here?

15:31.098 --> 15:32.665
You don't even have
a client on the show.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.167
- I heard that Whoopi
was on the show tonight

15:34.201 --> 15:36.003
and she needs a new publicist.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.504
So you need to take me
over there.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.572
- I will take you over
to Whoopi right now,

15:39.606 --> 15:41.441
but you have to promise
that you won't tell anybody

15:41.474 --> 15:43.510
this is a racist show...

15:43.543 --> 15:45.178
or that we have lice.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.380
- You have lice?

15:47.414 --> 15:50.583
- No.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.685
- Deal.
- Deal.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.288
*

16:07.200 --> 16:09.736
- Sup, bro?

16:09.769 --> 16:11.571
I'm Todd.

16:11.604 --> 16:14.474
Ezra, right?

16:14.507 --> 16:16.676
Just gonna chill real quick.

16:16.709 --> 16:17.977
Is that cool?

16:22.149 --> 16:24.317
You like coffee, right?

16:24.351 --> 16:27.620
Yeah, I can get you some
coffee there.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.189
[chuckles]

16:29.222 --> 16:31.058
I'll have some too.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.460
There we go.

16:38.531 --> 16:41.434
Coffee actually does make it
feel more normal here.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.140
Whoa-ho-ho.

16:49.209 --> 16:52.445
Oh.
Okay.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.214
Oh, look at these guns.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.083
Ho-ho-ho!
Look at the guns.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.551
Oh, my God.
Oh, Jesus.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.420
Oh, I sp--
Oh.

17:00.453 --> 17:03.423
Oh, boy.
Oh, jeez.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.691
I'll get that off for you.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.626
I'll get you off.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.728
- Hey, what are you doing?

17:08.761 --> 17:10.463
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry, man.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.099
- Wait, wait, hold it.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.134
I told you you could touch him,
but not like that.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.303
This dummy is only 12 years old.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.770
- What?
Oh, what?

17:17.804 --> 17:19.406
No, no, no.
I wasn't touching his dick.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.441
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just get out of here.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.276
People like you disgust me.
- What?

17:23.310 --> 17:25.278
People like--I was trying
to be social.

17:25.312 --> 17:27.380
Your dummy's antisocial.
- "Social."

17:27.414 --> 17:28.381
Nice euphemism.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.217
- I'm a good man.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.186
*

17:33.220 --> 17:34.387
[knocking on door]
- Yeah?

17:34.421 --> 17:35.555
- Whoopi? Ms. Goldberg?

17:35.588 --> 17:37.357
Hi. Hi.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.326
I just wanted to come in and
brief you on your interview,

17:39.359 --> 17:41.261
but before I do that,
I want to introduce you--

17:41.294 --> 17:43.096
- Is this to prove to me

17:43.130 --> 17:44.364
you know black people
and have black friends?

17:44.397 --> 17:45.498
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

17:45.532 --> 17:46.633
We're not friends.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.235
I'm Malik Walker, publicist.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.236
We met at the Met Ball.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.570
Six years ago.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.472
- Okay, I only want
to talk to you.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.607
- Me?
- You.

17:54.641 --> 17:58.211
- Okay, well, I'm just going to
leave my card right here.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.412
We'll be in touch.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.515
- [clears throat]

18:04.217 --> 18:05.885
- [sighs]
Look...

18:05.918 --> 18:08.788
I don't know how to even begin
this conversation.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.591
When I came in, everybody had
those, you know, cornrows

18:11.624 --> 18:14.361
in their hair and I was feeling
really uncomfortable

18:14.394 --> 18:16.296
and, you know, looking around
and thinking,

18:16.329 --> 18:18.198
"What, are you making
fun of me?"

18:18.231 --> 18:20.133
'Cause you couldn't get it
together with the dreads

18:20.167 --> 18:21.301
so you got cornrows?

18:21.334 --> 18:22.335
You got me the watermelon.

18:22.369 --> 18:23.470
It's a whole thing.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.172
But then this guy comes in

18:25.205 --> 18:28.341
and tells me that you have
a lice infestation.

18:28.375 --> 18:31.244
A lice infestation.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.912
What the hell?

18:32.945 --> 18:34.247
That is the most disgust--

18:34.281 --> 18:35.682
it's the nastiest.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.250
It's like...

18:37.284 --> 18:39.186
It's like coochie juice
on the chair.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.653
Tell me honestly.
I just--

18:40.687 --> 18:42.455
I just want somebody
to talk to me honestly.

18:42.489 --> 18:45.325
Are you racist, or do you have

18:45.358 --> 18:47.627
a lice infestation here?

18:47.660 --> 18:48.728
I can't say it any clearer.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.331
- Oh, okay.

18:51.364 --> 18:54.167
We...

18:54.201 --> 18:57.937
We're...we're...

18:57.970 --> 19:02.642
Rrr...

19:02.675 --> 19:03.643
Racist.

19:03.676 --> 19:04.644
- [gasps]

19:04.677 --> 19:05.945
Yes!
- Oh!

19:05.978 --> 19:06.946
- Oh, my God.

19:06.979 --> 19:07.947
I can't believe you

19:07.980 --> 19:10.183
were so honest with me.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.884
You know, I work in television,

19:11.918 --> 19:14.487
and no one ever tells you
the truth.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.323
You know, you get these
big networks

19:16.356 --> 19:18.191
and they know what they are,

19:18.225 --> 19:20.627
and they pretend they're not,
but you know.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.862
I just love that you're honest.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.497
As matter of fact,

19:24.531 --> 19:25.832
it's blowing my mind.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.867
And I think I would like
to make "Nightcap"

19:27.900 --> 19:30.837
someplace I come, you know,
whenever I have

19:30.870 --> 19:32.339
something I need to do.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.773
- I got to tell you something.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.775
I like being racist.

19:35.808 --> 19:39.212
*

19:39.246 --> 19:41.281
Penny.
- [gasps] Staci.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.749
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.517
- Listen, the lice story
didn't break.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.753
Whoopi thinks we're racist,
which is so cool,

19:46.786 --> 19:47.887
so it's going to be
a great show.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.589
- Um, no, it's not.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.258
I just got off the phone with
Dennis Leary's manager,

19:51.291 --> 19:52.592
and he's not coming tonight.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.993
- What?

19:54.026 --> 19:56.396
- He says you gave him lice.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.265
- Well, that is on us.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.267
All right, tell the
ventriloquist and that dummy

20:00.300 --> 20:02.369
they have two segments
on the show tonight.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.736
- Ezra's going to be so excited.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.438
- He's gonna get a woody.
- What?

20:05.472 --> 20:06.773
- A puppet erection.
