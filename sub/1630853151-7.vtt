WEBVTT

00:08.747 --> 00:09.966
Hi.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.360
Yeah!

00:14.579 --> 00:16.103
Yay!

00:18.105 --> 00:19.715
Yay.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.807
Hmm.

00:27.418 --> 00:28.463
Proud of you.

00:30.421 --> 00:31.422
Thanks.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.033
Now all I need
is a trophy case

00:33.076 --> 00:34.686
and a magnifying glass.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.775
Size doesn't matter.

00:36.819 --> 00:38.125
Not helping.

00:39.126 --> 00:42.346
Look, Tom, you earned them,
you should be happy.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.479
I haven't come in
higher than 26th.

00:44.522 --> 00:47.308
Why do they even
give out trophies for 26th?

00:47.351 --> 00:49.223
By the time they called my name,
the alley was already

00:49.266 --> 00:51.181
setting up for a birthday party.

00:52.269 --> 00:53.096
I'm in a rut.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.576
Tom...I just don't get it.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.534
I've changed my approach,
my ball speed,

00:56.578 --> 00:57.883
my release point.

00:57.927 --> 00:59.059
I don't know what else to do.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.366
Sweetie,

01:02.410 --> 01:03.802
look, you're gonna
get through this.

01:03.846 --> 01:05.413
Okay? What does Archie say?

01:05.456 --> 01:08.155
"You're not keeping
your elbow in!"

01:08.198 --> 01:10.940
"Stop flipping your damn wrist!
You're chopping pins!"

01:12.289 --> 01:15.249
My point is he only says
what I'm doing wrong.Hey.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.773
Look, six months ago,
you were installing seat belts

01:17.816 --> 01:20.558
on an assembly line, and now
you are a professional bowler.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.647
Yeah, but...Bup, bup, bup,
bup, bup, bup.

01:22.691 --> 01:25.215
The fact is, there is
a roof over our heads,

01:25.259 --> 01:25.302
the bills are paid,
there's food on that table.

01:27.348 --> 01:28.566
I know.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.177
But I have to be getting
top-ten finishes

01:30.220 --> 01:32.135
if I want to get
in the World Series of Bowling.

01:32.179 --> 01:33.615
Yeah, and you've already earned
half those points

01:33.658 --> 01:35.356
you need to get there
and you have one of

01:35.399 --> 01:37.793
the highest series averages
of any rookie on the tour.

01:38.794 --> 01:41.101
You know it turns me on when
you talk bowling stats, right?

01:41.144 --> 01:44.147
Well, come upstairs

01:44.191 --> 01:46.018
and I'll read you
some split percentages

01:46.062 --> 01:48.369
while I jump rope in a tube top.

01:48.412 --> 01:50.545
Really?No!

01:51.459 --> 01:53.025
My point is

01:53.069 --> 01:55.332
I think you need to change
your perspective.

01:55.376 --> 01:58.030
Saying you're in a rut only
puts you deeper in a rut.

01:58.074 --> 02:00.163
Change your thoughts,
change your life.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.644
I'm not in... I'm not in a rut.

02:02.687 --> 02:03.645
I'm not...Try harder.

02:03.688 --> 02:04.646
I'm not in a rut.

02:04.689 --> 02:05.821
Okay, warmer. Turn it up.

02:07.605 --> 02:08.563
I am not in a rut!

02:08.606 --> 02:10.260
There's my man!

02:10.304 --> 02:12.262
That's the power
of positive thinking.

02:12.306 --> 02:15.135
You will go upstairs
and jump rope in a tube top!

02:16.353 --> 02:18.138
Nice try.

02:34.241 --> 02:36.373
Wait, what?

02:36.417 --> 02:38.419
What are you doing?
It's00 a.m.

02:38.462 --> 02:39.855
Yeah, I've been up since00.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.596
I couldn't stop thinking about
what you said,

02:41.639 --> 02:44.120
so I found a podcast
on the power of positivity.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.643
Oh, thank God.

02:45.687 --> 02:46.731
So that's what you were doing
with your phone

02:46.775 --> 02:48.385
under the covers last night.

02:49.604 --> 02:51.345
Yeah, more or less.

02:52.389 --> 02:53.782
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

02:53.825 --> 02:55.653
Look, it's hosted
by a sports psychologist.

02:55.697 --> 02:57.829
He's worked with pro athletes
for over 30 years.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.396
It's all about
thought replacement.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.572
Positive thoughts,
productive results.

03:01.616 --> 03:03.966
Ah, sounds a lot like
what I told you last night,

03:04.009 --> 03:05.837
but now that a man said it...

03:05.881 --> 03:07.361
I'm glad you're excited.

03:08.492 --> 03:09.885
You didn't buy anything,
did you?

03:09.928 --> 03:11.321
I'm not a sucker.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.062
You bought an umbrella
off an infomercial.

03:13.105 --> 03:15.717
Yeah, umbrella technology
hasn't changed in 100 years.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.588
Excuse me for being curious.

03:18.546 --> 03:19.938
Okay,

03:19.982 --> 03:22.593
but just to be clear,
you didn't buy anything?

03:28.164 --> 03:29.905
Good morning, my friends.

03:30.819 --> 03:31.994
Thinking about the past,

03:32.037 --> 03:33.300
that's depression.

03:33.343 --> 03:35.519
Thinking about the future,
that's anxiety.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.739
Today is a new day.

03:37.782 --> 03:40.307
Facts.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.092
Hey, listen.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.094
You only got four
more tournaments

03:45.137 --> 03:46.661
before the World Series
of Bowling.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.967
So, today may be a new day,

03:49.011 --> 03:51.753
but your game sucks as much
as it did yesterday.

03:53.668 --> 03:55.844
Your enthusiasm's
not lost on me.

03:55.887 --> 03:58.716
I don't think you're listening
to what I'm saying.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.065
You're placing in the middle

04:00.109 --> 04:02.285
'cause you're bowling
like a damn fool.

04:02.329 --> 04:03.634
Now, today
you're gonna practice

04:03.678 --> 04:04.940
hitting the 3-9 sleeper.

04:04.983 --> 04:07.290
Love the passion.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.466
I want you to do that
100 times.

04:09.510 --> 04:12.121
And if the sun is still up,
I want you to do it 100 more.

04:12.164 --> 04:14.428
Man, I'm staying on you
like a streak

04:14.471 --> 04:17.822
on a low-flow toilet
until you come out of this rut.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.389
Bup, bup, bup, bup.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.957
Archie, we're not using
the word "rut" anymore.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.394
Well, are we using this word?

04:24.438 --> 04:26.527
"Shut your damn mouth and bowl."

04:27.789 --> 04:30.052
You know, in Biology
of the Happy Brain,

04:30.095 --> 04:32.663
they say you should match every
negative with two positives.

04:33.664 --> 04:35.971
Wait, I didn't know you
listened to Happy Brain.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.320
Man, I love Dr. Hughes.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.627
Attitude is a choice.

04:41.019 --> 04:42.325
You know what else is a choice?

04:42.369 --> 04:44.066
I-I'm-a get back to work.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.939
I think you should give
this podcast a try, Arch.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.680
Be more positive.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.987
I don't want to overstep, but
you can be a little grouchy,

04:52.030 --> 04:53.945
a little critical.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.120
I'm critical

04:55.164 --> 04:58.210
because I'm trying to help you.

04:58.254 --> 04:59.603
No pain, no gain.

04:59.647 --> 05:02.693
Eh. Dr. Hughes says,
"No pain, no pain."

05:02.737 --> 05:03.955
Oh, boy.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.566
I'm just saying
it might help me

05:05.609 --> 05:07.437
to hear something supportive
every once in a while.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.221
You don't need
buttering up, Tom,

05:09.265 --> 05:10.527
you need a coach.
And don't forget,

05:10.571 --> 05:11.833
my way has gotten you this far.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.269
Yeah, but I've plateaued.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.967
Sometimes you need
a shoulder to stand on

05:16.011 --> 05:17.752
if you want to shoot
for the moon.

05:17.795 --> 05:19.928
Dr. Hughes says,
"If you miss the moon,

05:19.971 --> 05:21.669
you'll still land
amongst the stars."

05:21.712 --> 05:25.107
What in the blue hell
is you talking about right now?

05:26.108 --> 05:28.371
The moon is closer to the Earth
than any star.

05:28.415 --> 05:29.807
You know how far it is
to a star?

05:29.851 --> 05:31.374
If you go...
You know, this is ridiculous.

05:33.289 --> 05:35.944
I don't want to be placing in
the middle of the pack forever.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.293
I want to be at the top.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.773
And maybe I'd get there faster

05:38.816 --> 05:40.427
if we tried something new.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.559
Okay. Fine.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.387
I'll listen to
your stupid podcast,

05:44.431 --> 05:47.303
if you're willing
to try something new.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.435
Yeah, I'm open to new stuff.

05:48.478 --> 05:49.740
You sure?Yes.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.263
'Cause this is
real cutting-edge stuff.

05:51.307 --> 05:52.482
Yeah, give it to me.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.964
Shut your damn mouth and bowl.

06:01.752 --> 06:02.971
Wow.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.626
This place looks
like a real salon.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.932
Thanks.
Now I just got to get better

06:07.976 --> 06:09.238
at cleaning up before dinner.

06:09.281 --> 06:10.544
Last night
I had a few complaints

06:10.587 --> 06:12.241
about my spaghetti
and hair balls.

06:14.330 --> 06:15.592
I got everything on your list.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.246
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

06:17.289 --> 06:19.117
I've been too busy
to hit the supply store.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.293
Back-to-back cuts,
colors, extensions.

06:21.337 --> 06:23.948
I even trimmed a guy's toupee.On his head?

06:23.992 --> 06:25.820
No, his wife brought it in.
She just needed

06:25.863 --> 06:27.387
to get it back
before he woke up.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.608
I can't believe
how busy you are.

06:31.652 --> 06:32.957
I know.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.306
I could actually use
a little help this weekend

06:34.350 --> 06:35.873
if you're free.I wish I could.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.484
There's no way Ruth is
gonna give me the time off.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.355
I'm supposed to be at
the dentist right now.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.444
If she checks my teeth,
I'm screwed.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.491
Here. I have some cotton balls

06:44.534 --> 06:46.449
you can cram in your cheeks
if it'll help.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.451
I'd love to have a job

06:48.495 --> 06:49.844
where I could just
lie about being sick

06:49.887 --> 06:51.715
without having to prove it.Mm.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.674
Well, if I ever
figure all this out,

06:53.717 --> 06:55.719
who knows--
maybe we can partner up.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.460
Oh, my God.
That would be amazing.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.114
Wouldn't it?

06:59.157 --> 07:01.116
You could lie about being sick
as much as you want.

07:01.159 --> 07:04.772
I'd even throw in
one week of paid hangover days.

07:06.034 --> 07:08.123
That'll get me
through January 8.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.518
Someday.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.737
Well, back to reality.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.135
I hate my life.

07:23.747 --> 07:25.662
Hey.

07:27.925 --> 07:29.579
Podcast?Yeah, you know it.

07:29.623 --> 07:31.015
Hmm. So, did Archie

07:31.059 --> 07:33.235
kind of hate it
or really hate it?

07:33.278 --> 07:34.889
Hate does not exist.

07:34.932 --> 07:37.326
It's really just
the absence of love.

07:37.369 --> 07:39.328
But he really
the absence of loved it.Mm.

07:42.287 --> 07:43.680
Oh, hey.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.203
What are you doing back?
Did you forget something?

07:45.247 --> 07:48.206
Guess who's named Tia
and just quit her job.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.426
Ah. That's an easy one.

07:51.427 --> 07:54.082
Me. I did it. I quit.What?!

07:54.125 --> 07:56.650
I'm all in on Team Tia and Jen.

07:56.693 --> 07:59.130
Jen and Tia. But what?!

08:00.610 --> 08:03.395
I told Ruth that I quit
so that I come work for you.

08:03.439 --> 08:04.875
Where should I set up?

08:04.919 --> 08:07.835
Wait, Tia, when we talked about
working together,

08:07.878 --> 08:10.577
I meant someday, not today.

08:10.620 --> 08:13.623
Oh, every day's a someday
before it's a today.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.800
Look, okay, look,

08:16.844 --> 08:19.629
this-this kitchen is not ideal
for something like this.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.892
This isn't going to be easy.Well, that's fine.

08:21.936 --> 08:24.416
I'd rather be
on a bumpy road to somewhere

08:24.460 --> 08:26.462
than a dead end road to nowhere.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.029
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:28.072 --> 08:30.553
Tia Maria, that was beautiful.

08:30.597 --> 08:31.902
That was inspired. It's...

08:31.946 --> 08:34.426
Dial it back, babe.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.037
How did Ruth take all this?

08:36.080 --> 08:37.168
Surprisingly well.

08:37.212 --> 08:38.518
Really?Yeah.

08:38.561 --> 08:39.606
She hugged me.

08:39.649 --> 08:40.650
She gave me this
card to give you.

08:40.694 --> 08:42.609
Card?

08:44.480 --> 08:46.482
"Good luck..." Aw.Aw.

08:47.744 --> 08:50.530
"...with the inspector
I reported you to

08:50.573 --> 08:53.489
for illegally running a business
out of your kitchen."

08:54.925 --> 08:56.536
"P.S. You can suck a..."

08:58.494 --> 09:00.583
Oh, my God,
she's gonna shut down

09:00.627 --> 09:02.498
the Tia and Jen Salon
before it even opens.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.022
Jen and Tia, and she's
not closing down anything.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.590
Jen and Tia.Yeah.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.244
Tia and Jen.

09:09.287 --> 09:12.813
Closed minds will never
shut down open hearts.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.730
I just made that up.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.166
This might be positive thinking,

09:18.209 --> 09:19.820
but I think
I'm really good at this.

09:21.691 --> 09:22.953
Hey, hey, hey, Lew my dude.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.041
Hey, heads up.

09:24.085 --> 09:26.087
Archie's in a weird mood.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.175
Oh, what do you mean?

09:27.218 --> 09:28.655
Good morning, fellow travelers

09:28.698 --> 09:30.831
on this crazy rock
we call Earth.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.704
That's what I mean.

09:42.277 --> 09:44.235
Somebody's in a good mood.

09:44.279 --> 09:45.933
Y-You want to get to practice?

09:45.976 --> 09:47.238
Not quite yet.

10:02.427 --> 10:03.603
All right, let's get to work.

10:15.702 --> 10:18.182
Oh, nice approach, Tom.

10:18.226 --> 10:19.488
Your footwork is so good

10:19.531 --> 10:21.969
it's like Bruno Mars
had a baby with Usher.

10:23.100 --> 10:26.843
Wow, man, you really took this
podcast to heart. It's great.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.715
Well, you told me to listen.
I listened.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.673
Gave me a new perspective.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.588
Hey, Arch,
how's my game looking?

10:32.632 --> 10:35.286
Carl... I love your passion

10:35.330 --> 10:37.288
and dedication to the sport.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.856
Look, it doesn't matter
what the score is

10:39.900 --> 10:41.162
as long as you love it.

10:41.205 --> 10:42.467
Thanks, man.

10:44.165 --> 10:46.341
And, Tom, that was
a hell of a shot!

10:46.384 --> 10:47.342
Ooh.

10:47.385 --> 10:48.996
Wow.

10:49.039 --> 10:50.345
I don't think I've ever
heard you say that before.

10:50.388 --> 10:51.694
Well, I meant it.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.914
Thanks for giving
this podcast a try.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.176
Tom,

10:55.219 --> 10:58.483
there is no triumph
without a "try."

11:00.224 --> 11:01.878
And an "umph."

11:03.010 --> 11:04.098
Damn it, Lew...

11:06.013 --> 11:08.189
...how can one man
have so much wit?

11:13.455 --> 11:15.109
Dang it.

11:15.152 --> 11:16.806
That's the third spare
I've missed today.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.678
That was a hell of a shot, Tom.

11:18.721 --> 11:19.766
Thanks.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.811
Love that you keep saying that.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.378
What am I doing wrong, Arch?

11:23.421 --> 11:25.685
Not focusing on
what you're doing right,

11:25.728 --> 11:27.687
which, from where
I'm sitting, is a lot.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.384
I'm still chopping pins, though.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.212
Yeah, you're chopping pins,

11:31.255 --> 11:33.388
but your release point
is right on the money.

11:33.431 --> 11:34.694
Come on, man.

11:34.737 --> 11:35.999
I got no follow-through.

11:36.043 --> 11:38.219
I look like a damn fool.

11:39.046 --> 11:42.397
You sound just like
Archie, but less hot.

11:43.441 --> 11:45.052
Um, the problem isn't your body,

11:45.095 --> 11:46.880
It's your mind.

11:46.923 --> 11:49.491
You got to visualize
knocking down the pins.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.536
It's just like Dr. Hughes said,

11:51.580 --> 11:54.452
"See the win, be the win."

11:55.410 --> 11:57.760
Visualizing is great, but if I
don't start knocking down pins,

11:57.804 --> 12:01.285
I'm gonna see the foreclosure
and be on the street.

12:04.158 --> 12:05.507
No offense, Tom,

12:05.550 --> 12:07.727
but you can be
a little grumpy sometimes.

12:14.777 --> 12:17.127
Oh, hey.
Okay, could you give me a hand?

12:17.171 --> 12:20.130
I'm hiding any trace of
having a salon in the kitchen.

12:20.174 --> 12:22.785
I canceled all my appointments.
I took all the bags of hair

12:22.829 --> 12:24.134
from our trash
out to the street.

12:24.178 --> 12:25.483
Sure you have
to do all this?

12:25.527 --> 12:27.224
The inspector could drop
in at any minute,

12:27.268 --> 12:28.791
and if I'm caught
it's a $10,000 fine.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.793
You sure you're doing
it fast enough?

12:31.881 --> 12:33.753
Okay.
You know, in the meantime,

12:33.796 --> 12:35.015
Tia's looking for chairs

12:35.058 --> 12:36.320
we can rent someplace

12:36.364 --> 12:38.322
or maybe a super cheap
place of our own.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.063
But every time
I tell a realtor our budget,

12:40.107 --> 12:43.066
they hang up on me or they
laugh in a really mean way.

12:44.372 --> 12:47.070
If Archie was here, he'd tell
you to visualize a new salon.

12:47.114 --> 12:48.245
What are you talking about?

12:48.289 --> 12:49.203
He listened
to the podcast.

12:49.246 --> 12:50.465
Now he's Mr. Positive.

12:50.508 --> 12:52.032
Isn't that
what you wanted?

12:52.075 --> 12:53.598
Yeah, but we didn't
get anything done all day.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.296
He's not even
coaching me.

12:55.339 --> 12:57.037
He just showers me
with compliments.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.343
It's like his whole personality
changed overnight.

12:59.387 --> 13:00.649
Oh, this is like

13:00.692 --> 13:02.433
when Felicity chopped off
all her curls.

13:03.391 --> 13:04.914
I'm sorry.
I see everything in hair.

13:06.524 --> 13:07.961
He didn't say one
negative thing all day.

13:08.004 --> 13:09.397
I tested him.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.051
I threw a gutter ball
on purpose, he said,

13:11.094 --> 13:13.053
"Mistakes are just successes
spelled differently."

13:13.096 --> 13:14.837
I mean, how does
that make sense?

13:14.881 --> 13:16.665
Completely different letters.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.668
Really out of character for him.Yeah.

13:22.062 --> 13:23.498
He's messing with me, isn't he?

13:23.541 --> 13:24.716
I didn't say that.No, he is.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.631
That's it.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.982
Only Archie could
weaponize positivity.

13:29.025 --> 13:31.288
God, I've created the nicest
monster in the world.

13:32.681 --> 13:34.248
Franken-kind.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.778
Hey.

13:44.171 --> 13:45.955
Come on, man.
Let's get to work.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.478
Hey, buddy.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.393
I think we start
with ten minutes of gratitude.

13:49.437 --> 13:50.742
Knock it off.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.092
I'm gonna bowl,
you're gonna yell

13:52.135 --> 13:53.876
what I'm doing wrong.
You win.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.965
I don't think you've given
the power of positivity

13:56.009 --> 13:57.314
enough of a shot.

13:57.358 --> 13:59.360
I get it.
It's a stupid podcast

13:59.403 --> 14:00.970
and positivity doesn't work.

14:01.014 --> 14:03.016
You proved your point.What are you talking about?

14:03.059 --> 14:04.365
I'm talking about
you screwing with me

14:04.408 --> 14:05.801
instead of coaching me.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.281
The World Series
is right around the corner.

14:07.324 --> 14:08.543
We don't have time for this.

14:08.586 --> 14:09.544
Screwing with you?

14:09.587 --> 14:10.850
Why would I screw with you?

14:10.893 --> 14:12.155
I have no idea.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.896
You said all this would help.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.333
I wanted you to be
a little bit more positive,

14:16.377 --> 14:18.205
not turn into Dolly Parton.

14:18.248 --> 14:19.946
Oh, okay.

14:19.989 --> 14:21.773
So, so first,
I'm too negative,

14:21.817 --> 14:23.079
then I'm too positive,

14:23.123 --> 14:24.864
now, all of a sudden,
I'm screwing with you?

14:24.907 --> 14:26.561
Tell me you're not.

14:26.604 --> 14:27.997
I'm not!

14:32.697 --> 14:35.962
I think maybe the problem is you
don't trust me as your coach.

14:36.005 --> 14:39.487
Arch... Arch.

14:40.531 --> 14:42.055
Okay, bye.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.362
Well, any luck?

14:45.406 --> 14:48.235
I just found a place
in our price range.

14:48.278 --> 14:50.280
But it's close to a manure farm.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.456
It's on a manure farm.
It's a barn.

14:55.024 --> 14:57.505
At least your kitchen looks
like a kitchen again.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.202
Except for these.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.683
Oh, God. They must have
fallen out of my bag.

15:01.726 --> 15:02.684
Good save.

15:04.642 --> 15:06.862
Uh-oh.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.951
Look, okay, this isn't
what it looks like.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.345
Hi.

15:11.388 --> 15:14.391
You know,
we were clipping coupons.Mm-hmm.

15:14.435 --> 15:18.047
With a pair of stainless steel
Amandalena thinning shears?

15:18.091 --> 15:20.484
Is that a crime, copper?

15:23.183 --> 15:24.880
No, it isn't.

15:24.924 --> 15:28.231
However, illegally operating
a salon in your kitchen is.

15:28.275 --> 15:29.841
I know. Good
thing there is none of that

15:29.885 --> 15:31.278
going on here.

15:31.321 --> 15:32.975
There's a bag of human hair
in the trash bin

15:33.019 --> 15:34.542
that would suggest otherwise.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.239
That's not ours.Mm-mm.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.719
We're holding that
for a friend.

15:37.762 --> 15:40.635
Yes, his name is
Joe Friend... erson.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.202
Joe Frienderson.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.682
He's an attorney
at Frienderson and Sons.

15:44.726 --> 15:46.815
He's bald. Now.

15:48.425 --> 15:49.949
Oh.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.473
Well, then I'm sorry
for the misunderstanding.

15:52.516 --> 15:55.606
Oh, yeah, one last thing.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.086
I'm not an idiot!

15:58.653 --> 16:00.872
Having a salon--
or any business--

16:00.916 --> 16:02.874
in a living space
is a direct violation

16:02.918 --> 16:04.615
of Article 104-6

16:04.659 --> 16:06.530
of the Michigan Business
Corporation Act.

16:06.574 --> 16:07.836
Okay, r-right.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.533
Fair enough, but...

16:09.577 --> 16:11.927
But you are allowed to operate
an independent salon

16:11.971 --> 16:13.885
if it is enclosed
by full partitions

16:13.929 --> 16:15.844
and doors from a dwelling.

16:15.887 --> 16:17.541
And if it's
a full-service salon,

16:17.585 --> 16:19.935
it must have shampoo bowls
and a separate hand-washing sink

16:19.979 --> 16:21.676
to clean tools,

16:21.719 --> 16:23.678
according to 109-7

16:23.721 --> 16:26.028
of the Michigan Business
Corporation Act.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.338
Okay.

16:31.381 --> 16:33.253
You know your stuff,

16:33.296 --> 16:35.690
but the kitchen
still isn't gonna pass code.

16:35.733 --> 16:38.780
Okay, but...

16:40.086 --> 16:41.609
But...

16:41.652 --> 16:43.393
But...But the sunroom does.

16:43.437 --> 16:46.135
Or it will, uh...

16:46.179 --> 16:48.268
I mean, obviously,
I would never cut hair

16:48.311 --> 16:49.617
in a kitchen.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.055
Can you get water in here
for the sinks?

16:53.099 --> 16:54.361
Um...

16:54.404 --> 16:56.015
Yeah, we can
tap into the main line,

16:56.058 --> 16:58.017
which runs two feet along
the south wall of this room.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.844
It's three-quarter inch
high-density polyethylene,

16:59.888 --> 17:01.368
so that'll be plenty
for what we need.

17:02.325 --> 17:05.067
All right, well,
get that done,

17:05.111 --> 17:07.287
and then all you have to do
is apply for a business license,

17:07.330 --> 17:08.505
and you're all set.

17:08.549 --> 17:09.767
Okay, I-I'm sorry
that you came

17:09.811 --> 17:11.291
all the way out here
for nothing.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.467
It's fine.
Ruth does this to other salons

17:13.510 --> 17:14.990
about once a week.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.648
You were amazing.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.084
Where did all that come from?

17:22.128 --> 17:23.651
I don't know.
It just hit me

17:23.694 --> 17:25.609
when she said
"Michigan Corporation Act."

17:25.653 --> 17:28.090
You're not the only one that's
dreamed of having a salon.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.439
I didn't even realize

17:29.483 --> 17:31.093
I could have a legal salon
in my house

17:31.137 --> 17:32.703
until you said all of that.

17:32.747 --> 17:34.140
And what about you,
with all that water stuff?

17:34.183 --> 17:36.272
When Tom was at the factory
and something broke,

17:36.316 --> 17:38.448
all the contractors thought
they could rip me off.

17:38.492 --> 17:41.321
I decided I needed to know more
about this house than they did.

17:41.364 --> 17:42.409
You're a badass.

17:42.452 --> 17:43.801
No, you're a badass.

17:43.845 --> 17:44.802
No, you're a badass.

17:44.846 --> 17:45.803
You are.You are.

17:45.847 --> 17:46.804
How long does this go on for?

17:46.848 --> 17:47.936
Forever.Ah!

17:52.419 --> 17:53.985
Hey, Arch.

17:54.029 --> 17:56.466
You, uh, want a Kit Kat?

17:58.164 --> 18:01.123
I-I got it from
the vending machine, so...

18:01.167 --> 18:02.951
this is money
right back in your pocket.

18:11.046 --> 18:13.048
You know I trust you, right?

18:13.092 --> 18:14.136
Do you?

18:14.180 --> 18:16.399
Yes. Come on, man.

18:16.443 --> 18:19.010
You sort of made fun
of the whole positivity thing,

18:19.054 --> 18:21.274
a lot, in front of everybody.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.624
And next thing I know,
you're all in.

18:23.667 --> 18:24.755
That was weird.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.844
You damn right I went all in.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.237
I've always been all in.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.152
And I wouldn't screw
with your dream, Tom.

18:30.196 --> 18:33.721
Because it's my dream, too.

18:33.764 --> 18:35.331
Yeah, I-I know, it's...

18:35.375 --> 18:36.550
Look.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.117
When you told me
we needed to switch

18:38.160 --> 18:39.335
to a more positive style,

18:39.379 --> 18:41.163
you didn't have to ask me twice.

18:41.207 --> 18:44.384
I listened to 14 episodes
of that podcast.

18:45.472 --> 18:46.864
You didn't
buy anything, did you?

18:47.865 --> 18:50.694
I ordered
the damn mindfulness bell.

18:51.956 --> 18:53.132
I got the weighted hoodie.

18:53.175 --> 18:54.785
Don't tell Jen.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.787
She's still mad at me
for the Funbrella.

18:59.007 --> 19:02.053
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19:02.097 --> 19:03.620
For saying you should change.

19:04.621 --> 19:05.840
That's not it, Tom.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.842
You are in a
bit of a rut,

19:07.885 --> 19:09.191
and we did need to
try something new.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.627
That's how you grow.

19:10.671 --> 19:11.628
That's how you get better.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.021
Tom...

19:13.064 --> 19:14.501
I'm learning to be a pro coach

19:14.544 --> 19:16.155
just like you're learning
to be a pro bowler.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.330
And you're a great coach.

19:17.373 --> 19:18.853
Just, if all I hear

19:18.896 --> 19:19.984
is what I'm doing wrong,

19:20.028 --> 19:21.377
it's all I can think about.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.988
So, sometimes...

19:24.032 --> 19:25.468
you need to hear
what you're doing right.

19:25.512 --> 19:26.469
I got it.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.167
Not all the time.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.994
You know, a-a blend,
a fifty-fifty.

19:30.038 --> 19:31.561
Li-Like an Arnold Palmer.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.172
Oh, man, please.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.086
If you ain't going
70-30 ice tea,

19:35.130 --> 19:36.958
you're just a damn fool.

19:43.138 --> 19:45.314
All right, look.

19:45.358 --> 19:47.577
Let's say we
get better together.

19:47.621 --> 19:50.406
Deal.Okay.

19:50.450 --> 19:51.799
Now that we're all better, uh,

19:51.842 --> 19:53.279
you want to go halfsies
on this Kit Kat?

19:53.322 --> 19:54.932
Hey! Hell no.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.108
This is a gift.

20:02.505 --> 20:03.985
Jen?

20:04.028 --> 20:06.248
Oh, hey.
How was practice?

20:06.292 --> 20:07.641
Well, we started with

20:07.684 --> 20:09.643
a couple minutes of gratitude.Oh, no.

20:09.686 --> 20:11.514
But then Archie
started screaming at me

20:11.558 --> 20:13.777
about my release and threatened
to drill three holes in my head.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.345
That's great.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.956
Yeah.
I didn't chop a single pin.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.958
I think we have a shot
at cracking the top ten

20:21.002 --> 20:22.003
at the next tournament.

20:22.046 --> 20:24.092
Oh, you do that...

20:24.135 --> 20:26.050
and I'll jump rope
in a tube top.

20:26.094 --> 20:27.182
For real?

20:28.139 --> 20:29.576
Too bad you threw out
that jump rope.

20:29.619 --> 20:32.361
There's a way to do it
without the jump rope.
