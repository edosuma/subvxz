WEBVTT

00:03.211 --> 00:04.963
DOCTOR: You have to prepare
yourself for the possibility

00:05.046 --> 00:06.089
she won't survive
the night.

00:06.172 --> 00:08.925
Emily Fornell had counterfeit
opioids in her blood.

00:09.008 --> 00:11.553
McGee, you got point.

00:09.008 --> 00:11.553
For now, or...?

00:11.636 --> 00:13.763
Next couple of days.

00:11.636 --> 00:13.763
FORNELL:
I got a lead on the errand boy

00:13.847 --> 00:16.224
who supplied the poison that
nearly killed my little girl.

00:16.307 --> 00:18.977
The head of the snake.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.770
Perfect timing, Gibbs.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.770
GIBBS: Tobias?

00:20.854 --> 00:21.771
What'd you do?

00:21.855 --> 00:23.273
Nothing.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.649
Gonna need some time.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.443
Check back with me
in about two weeks.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.610
GIBBS:
Hey, McGee,

00:27.694 --> 00:28.778
you guys still out for drinks?

00:28.862 --> 00:30.155
McGEE:
Gibbs is coming, baby!

00:30.238 --> 00:31.281
(others cheering)

00:33.324 --> 00:35.326
(truck beeping)

00:43.752 --> 00:46.463
Matthew, breakfast.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.839
(bag rattling)

00:47.922 --> 00:50.633
Here, kitty, kitty.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.969
Matthew?

00:53.052 --> 00:55.472
Ooh, it's freezing out here.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.640
Where are you, baby?

00:57.724 --> 00:59.601
(cat meows)

00:57.724 --> 00:59.601
Oh.

00:59.684 --> 01:02.520
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.148
Matthew David McConaughey,
you leave that man alone

01:05.231 --> 01:06.733
and come home right now.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.778
(meows)

01:18.870 --> 01:21.706
Oh, my God.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.963
♪ ♪

02:00.161 --> 02:01.996
MAN:
Welcome to Beltway Burgers,

02:02.080 --> 02:03.665
where every day is
a Beltway day.

02:03.748 --> 02:05.667
May I please take your order?

02:05.750 --> 02:08.211
Uh, coffee, black.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.713
Would you like to make that
a Beltway breakfast combo

02:10.797 --> 02:12.465
for three dollars more?

02:12.549 --> 02:13.883
No.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.969
Next window, please.

02:19.347 --> 02:22.350
$1.59, please.

02:24.143 --> 02:26.062
Thank you.

02:26.145 --> 02:29.274
How's your morning so far, sir?

02:29.357 --> 02:31.484
Fine.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.484
I'm glad to hear that.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.695
Here's your coffee.

02:33.778 --> 02:36.155
And you have a Beltway day.

02:50.545 --> 02:51.713
What do you want?

02:51.796 --> 02:53.548
I'm on a five-minute
smoke break.

02:53.631 --> 02:55.091
They still have those?

02:53.631 --> 02:55.091
No.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.926
And I don't smoke.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.762
So, whatever it is you came
to say, make it fast.

02:59.846 --> 03:03.391
So, what are you doing...

03:03.474 --> 03:05.727
Toby?

03:03.474 --> 03:05.727
Hey!

03:05.810 --> 03:08.479
I earned that-- they don't
hire just anybody, you know.

03:08.563 --> 03:09.480
You said you had a lead.

03:09.564 --> 03:10.732
You're looking at it.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.567
What's fast
food got to do

03:12.650 --> 03:14.235
with counterfeit opioids?

03:12.650 --> 03:14.235
Okay.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.112
The pill pusher we were
supposed to be following?

03:16.195 --> 03:17.614
He worked here.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.781
The pill pusher you
were supposed

03:18.865 --> 03:20.199
to be following, Tobias.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.452
Not that again--
I didn't kill him!

03:22.535 --> 03:24.829
Kimberly!

03:26.331 --> 03:29.792
Good morning.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.836
It wasn't my fault.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.464
The pill pusher died
of a drug overdose, okay?

03:34.547 --> 03:36.132
I read the autopsy report.

03:36.215 --> 03:38.968
Well, then let's focus
on the real question here.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.803
What was a drug dealer,
who makes thousands of dollars

03:40.887 --> 03:44.807
a week, doing flipping burgers
for minimum wage, huh?

03:44.891 --> 03:47.268
That doesn't make sense.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.812
Unless this place had something
to do with the drugs.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.812
Exactly.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.189
I just need more time
to find out how.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.607
How much more time?

03:52.690 --> 03:54.484
Give me a few more days.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.818
I'm this close to getting

03:55.902 --> 03:57.278
freezer privileges.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.613
It's one of the few places

03:58.696 --> 04:00.031
I haven't been able
to search yet.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.616
That and the manager's office.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.159
He's kind of a hard-ass.

04:03.242 --> 04:05.912
Toby, five minutes are up.

04:05.995 --> 04:06.955
And who you talking to?

04:07.038 --> 04:09.165
Oh...

04:10.917 --> 04:12.835
Nobody.

04:12.919 --> 04:16.255
Just trying to psych up
for the next shift.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.882
Attaboy, T.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.009
Love the focus.

04:24.722 --> 04:26.849
McGEE:
Oh, this is a rough morning.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.269
Yeah, for all of us.

04:31.270 --> 04:33.690
You know, my head
is killing me.

04:31.270 --> 04:33.690
Yeah, tell me about it.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.150
I haven't had a hangover
this bad since Steve Jobs died.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.861
(groans)
McGee, this is all your fault.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.239
You invited Gibbs to the bar.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.239
In a million years,

04:41.322 --> 04:44.033
I didn't think he would
actually show, okay?

04:41.322 --> 04:44.033
He showed up.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.327
He showed up big-time
and he set the pace.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.204
The man can knock 'em back.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.204
What are you complaining about?

04:48.287 --> 04:49.914
You didn't even drink.

04:48.287 --> 04:49.914
Yeah, but I ate.

04:49.998 --> 04:53.001
I had those, uh, fresh,
uh, tuna poppers.

04:53.084 --> 04:56.004
And, uh, they
weren't so fresh.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.755
Oh.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.755
McGEE:
Food poisoning?

04:57.839 --> 05:00.383
How bad?

04:57.839 --> 05:00.383
I spent the whole
night in the bathtub.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.719
(retches)

05:00.466 --> 05:02.719
Sorry I asked.

05:02.802 --> 05:04.387
Hey, how do you think Gibbs
gets over his hangovers?

05:04.470 --> 05:05.888
GIBBS:
You don't.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.098
What we got?

05:07.181 --> 05:08.683
Our victim is
Chief Petty Officer

05:08.766 --> 05:10.977
Diego Barnes,
32 years old,

05:11.060 --> 05:12.937
who lived
in the next building over.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.731
It looks like he
was walking home

05:14.814 --> 05:17.025
over there when he was
initially attacked and then

05:17.108 --> 05:19.402
fled up the fire escape,
but, um,

05:19.485 --> 05:20.903
it was too late.

05:20.987 --> 05:21.821
We got a motive?

05:21.904 --> 05:25.074
His wallet and money were
still on him.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.493
That's how the police were able
to ID him before they called us.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.954
There are these deep gashes
all over his abdomen.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.915
And his insides are
now on the outside.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.752
Gutted him
like a fish.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.379
Yeah, this is either
personal or...

05:38.463 --> 05:40.757
we're looking for
a total psycho.

05:41.674 --> 05:42.925
(Bishop groaning)

05:43.009 --> 05:44.886
I can't do this.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.763
(McGee sighs)

05:46.846 --> 05:48.306
I'm gonna be sick.

05:48.389 --> 05:50.808
Ah, poor guy, I don't blame him.

05:50.892 --> 05:54.604
Uh, boss, I got something here
you might want to see.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.397
No, McGee, nobody wants
to see that.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.609
I didn't throw up;
someone else did.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.111
I think I found
our murder weapon.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.907
Well, the lacerations
on the body

06:05.990 --> 06:08.284
match the double-sided knife
found at the scene.

06:09.869 --> 06:10.953
Killer dropped it?

06:11.037 --> 06:12.789
While vomiting,
it seems.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.123
There's no bile
on the victim's mouth,

06:14.207 --> 06:15.958
so the mystery puke
must have come

06:16.042 --> 06:17.543
from whoever dropped
that knife.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.796
Kasie's running
DNA right now.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.339
Why carve him up
like this, Palmer?

06:21.422 --> 06:23.633
If you're asking for a motive,
I can't say for sure.

06:23.716 --> 06:27.136
What I can say is that all these
cuts occurred postmortem.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.931
So I would think
that the killer must have

06:30.014 --> 06:32.892
climbed the fire escape
and done all of his...

06:32.975 --> 06:34.310
carving up there.

06:34.393 --> 06:35.269
After the fact?

06:36.521 --> 06:40.024
Gibbs, I know right now
isn't the best time,

06:40.108 --> 06:42.193
but, uh, I just
wanted to say that

06:42.276 --> 06:44.028
last night was
really special.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.989
You joining us for drinks.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.783
I've always thought of you
as more than a coworker--

06:48.866 --> 06:51.160
a mentor, a father
figure of sorts.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.330
I feel like now I can add
"friend" to that list.

06:54.413 --> 06:56.874
Call me when you get
a motive.

07:01.629 --> 07:02.922
Agent Gibbs?!

07:04.590 --> 07:06.676
You told me to call you
when I found a motive.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.177
I think I just did.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.554
I found this lodged

07:09.637 --> 07:11.931
in the lower
esophageal sphincter.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.641
Must've swallowed it
just before he died.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.143
It looks like...

07:15.226 --> 07:17.687
a corner of some torn paper.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.856
Where's the rest of it?

07:19.939 --> 07:21.899
I'd say it was removed.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.776
The hard way.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.078
(McGee sighs)

07:36.455 --> 07:37.748
Mm, thanks.

07:36.455 --> 07:37.748
Ah.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.041
Yeah.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.377
Okay, Chief Petty Officer
Diego Barnes.

07:41.460 --> 07:44.172
A Navy recruiter
with a very clean record.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.299
McGee, hangover, make it bigger.

07:46.382 --> 07:47.884
Oh, yes, right.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.510
(chuckles)

07:49.594 --> 07:51.596
BISHOP:
Huh?

07:51.679 --> 07:54.515
Commendation Medal
for recruiting excellence.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.392
Clearly our victim was
a people person.

07:56.475 --> 07:58.060
And a rock person, too.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.229
BISHOP:
Barnes was a climber.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.564
McGEE:
Well, it explains
why he tried

08:01.647 --> 08:02.690
to get away up
the fire escape.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.400
It doesn't explain
why the killer

08:04.483 --> 08:07.111
followed him up there
and then cut him open.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.947
Well, according
to the autopsy report, this

08:10.031 --> 08:12.116
was the last thing Barnes
swallowed before he died.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.118
What is it?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.118
I have no idea.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.037
No, don't look at me,
the ibuprofen has

08:16.120 --> 08:17.246
definitely not kicked in yet.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.916
Hydrate,
hydrate, hydrate.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.542
It's the best cure
for a hangover.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.044
You'll feel better in no time.

08:23.127 --> 08:26.088
Says the woman
who left the bar early.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.799
I had a thing. What did I miss?

08:28.883 --> 08:30.718
Well, Gibbs ordered more tequila
shots and Bishop and Kasie

08:30.801 --> 08:33.095
decided to sing
"Islands in the Stream."

08:33.179 --> 08:34.972
I didn't know that bar
had karaoke.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.099
Yeah, they don't.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.893
Wow, you guys really did drink.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.770
It's kind of why we need
a fresh set of eyes here.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.772
You have any ideas
what these lines could be?

08:42.855 --> 08:44.482
Mm, those...

08:44.565 --> 08:47.235
look like topographical markers.

08:47.318 --> 08:48.319
Like from a map.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.239
Why would this guy
swallow a map?

08:51.322 --> 08:52.406
KASIE:
Chief Barnes

08:52.490 --> 08:54.158
didn't swallow
just any map, Gibbs.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.327
He swallowed
a treasure map.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.954
Yeah? I'm listening.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.623
Topographical markings are
kind of like fingerprints.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.625
No two are
exactly the same.

09:02.708 --> 09:04.585
So I ran the paper
from the body

09:04.669 --> 09:06.837
against the USGS
topo database

09:06.921 --> 09:08.339
and got a match.

09:08.422 --> 09:11.801
The victim swallowed
a map of Whitestone Gap.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.177
Virginia Mountains.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.346
Your cabin is in Virginia,
right?

09:15.429 --> 09:16.639
Not this far out.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.267
Whitestone Gap's
in the middle of nowhere.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.978
Which makes it the perfect place
to bury treasure.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.355
Kasie, what are you
talking about?

09:24.438 --> 09:26.274
Oh, so glad

09:26.357 --> 09:29.193
you asked-- I finished
processing the victim's laptop.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.612
Not only was he a rock climber,

09:31.696 --> 09:34.198
Chief Barnes was also
a treasure hunter.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.992
He spent
his spare time

09:36.075 --> 09:37.702
tracking clues
and solving puzzles

09:37.785 --> 09:39.870
connected
to lost Civil War gold,

09:39.954 --> 09:41.205
John Dillinger's
hidden cash,

09:41.289 --> 09:42.873
the Oak Island
Money Pit...

09:42.957 --> 09:44.875
Urban legends, Kase.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.875
Sure.

09:44.959 --> 09:48.004
Most of his hunting was based
on rumors from a century ago,

09:48.087 --> 09:50.506
but there is one hunt
he was obsessed with

09:50.589 --> 09:53.342
that is very modern
and very real.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.261
The DeMint treasure.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.638
Never heard of it.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.224
Oh... you're about to.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.350
Does this connect
back to the case?

10:01.434 --> 10:03.853
Would I talk about treasure
just because I love puzzles

10:03.936 --> 10:06.856
and I wore out my bootleg
Indiana Jones DVDs?

10:06.939 --> 10:08.232
Okay, go.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.860
Oh! Okay, so, ten years ago,

10:10.943 --> 10:13.654
a successful lawyer named
Angus DeMint quit his job,

10:13.738 --> 10:15.364
turned his life savings
into gold

10:15.448 --> 10:18.034
and then buried it somewhere
in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

10:18.117 --> 10:20.411
Why?

10:18.117 --> 10:20.411
Well, he talks about it all
in his book.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.789
A book that also contains
three secret codes.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.670
Codes lead to the treasure?

10:26.792 --> 10:29.670
If you can solve it.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.381
But ten years and thousands
of treasure hunters later,

10:32.465 --> 10:34.342
nobody's ever come close.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.384
Until now.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.512
You think Barnes solved
the codes and made a map.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.891
A treasure map
that was worth killing for.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.310
Now, of course, the only person
who can actually confirm

10:44.393 --> 10:46.187
any of this is the man
who created

10:46.270 --> 10:48.272
the treasure hunt himself.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.272
Angus DeMint.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.191
Mm-hmm. And if I'm right,

10:50.274 --> 10:52.276
he could tell us
where the killer is headed.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.111
Uh, hell yeah. Find him.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.197
(sighs)

10:58.824 --> 11:01.369
Two cases of onion rings,
one of nuggets.

11:01.452 --> 11:02.578
I won't let you down, boss.

11:02.661 --> 11:04.580
MANAGER:
And make it quick.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.388
(exhales)

11:28.104 --> 11:29.355
Hello.

11:55.339 --> 11:57.133
Bingo-bango.

11:58.467 --> 11:59.760
(knocking)

11:58.467 --> 11:59.760
MANAGER:
Toby!

11:59.844 --> 12:01.220
Let's go!

12:03.681 --> 12:05.599
Toby!

12:03.681 --> 12:05.599
Yeah. Coming, boss.

12:16.569 --> 12:20.322
Well, according
to his book publisher,

12:20.406 --> 12:22.575
Angus DeMint lives
just past this gate.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.995
Unfortunately, they also said
he doesn't have a phone.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.164
Guess if I buried a
million-dollar treasure

12:28.247 --> 12:32.293
everyone was after, I'd probably
go off the grid, too.

12:36.213 --> 12:37.506
Puzzle?

12:37.590 --> 12:40.134
Looks like a substitution code.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.511
Hey, I bet figuring this out

12:42.595 --> 12:45.139
will give us
the lock combination.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.894
MARGOT:
You're wasting your time.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.397
He won't give you any clues
to the treasure.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.859
Uh, we're not here
for the treasure.

12:56.942 --> 13:01.030
Special Agents Gibbs
and Bishop, NCIS.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.073
Sorry, I just thought

13:03.157 --> 13:05.326
you were more
of my father's crazy groupies.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.077
Angus DeMint is your father?

13:07.161 --> 13:08.746
For better or for worse.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.539
I'm Margot, by the way.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.042
And, like I said,
don't bother solving that.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.544
It's just one of Dad's
stupid codes.

13:16.378 --> 13:19.715
I bring him groceries
once a week,

13:19.798 --> 13:23.052
and each week
there's a new one to solve.

13:23.135 --> 13:27.723
Everything from Vigenère ciphers
to Morse code.

13:27.806 --> 13:30.267
So why does he do it?

13:30.351 --> 13:34.230
Same reason he created his
ridiculous treasure hunt.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.440
My father likes to play God.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.862
It's true.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.073
I was a corporate mouthpiece
who thought happiness

13:44.156 --> 13:46.742
was a high-rise condo
and making full partner.

13:46.825 --> 13:49.912
Oh, I was rich and powerful,
or so I thought.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.039
Sugar?

13:49.995 --> 13:52.039
Uh, no, thank you,
Mr. DeMint.

13:52.122 --> 13:54.583
Call me Angus.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.418
You don't look like
the sugar type.

13:56.502 --> 14:00.297
Do I look like
a tea type, Angus?

14:02.132 --> 14:05.553
Well, then my wife Lillian
passed away,

14:05.636 --> 14:07.429
rest her soul.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.890
Suddenly the truth became clear.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.309
Power

14:12.393 --> 14:14.728
and money are meaningless.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.565
So I swore off both
and I moved out here.

14:17.648 --> 14:22.278
You see,
it's simpler and I'm happier.

14:22.361 --> 14:25.406
And, uh, wanting to share
my epiphany with the world,

14:25.489 --> 14:27.408
I created a treasure hunt

14:27.491 --> 14:29.785
to encourage people

14:29.868 --> 14:31.912
to get outside and explore.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.665
To teach that life isn't
just about the destination,

14:34.748 --> 14:36.584
it's about enjoying the journey.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.086
Journey to a million dollars.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.462
Everybody needs incentive.
(chuckles)

14:40.546 --> 14:42.464
It's all in my book.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.674
MARGOT:
Dad,

14:43.757 --> 14:48.470
NCIS didn't come all the way out
here for the gospel of Angus.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.639
Honey, uh,

14:50.723 --> 14:53.142
I had asked for
chunky peanut butter.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.602
None of this was
on my grocery list.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.145
Well, if you wanted me
to actually read your list,

14:56.228 --> 14:58.105
you shouldn't have turned it
into a Caesar shift.

14:58.188 --> 14:59.940
Oh, you used to love
solving those.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.651
I'm not 12 anymore.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.651
BISHOP:
Okay, uh,

15:02.735 --> 15:04.778
Mr. DeMint, we're actually here

15:04.862 --> 15:06.780
because a man
was murdered last night,

15:06.864 --> 15:09.658
Chief Petty Officer
Diego Barnes.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.658
Yes.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.827
I read about it
on the message boards.

15:11.910 --> 15:14.622
You know the victim?

15:11.910 --> 15:14.622
Well, not personally.

15:14.705 --> 15:17.499
No, uh, after all,
I have thousands of followers.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.002
Yeah, could one of your
followers have been a murderer?

15:20.085 --> 15:21.629
Absolutely not.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.172
Nobody who's
truly dedicated

15:23.255 --> 15:25.341
to my teachings would ever kill.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.550
It's cheating.

15:26.634 --> 15:30.012
It goes against everything
this treasure hunt stands for.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.347
BISHOP:
Okay, well,

15:31.430 --> 15:32.681
we think Chief Barnes

15:32.765 --> 15:35.809
solved your codes
and made a map.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.770
He was killed for it.

15:40.397 --> 15:42.399
Then he was killed for nothing.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.652
You saying the map is wrong?

15:42.483 --> 15:44.652
I'm saying

15:44.735 --> 15:48.489
Whitestone Gap could be
the answer to one of the codes,

15:48.572 --> 15:51.617
but all three of my codes
are required to pinpoint

15:51.700 --> 15:54.703
the exact location
of the treasure.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.830
This map is only a general area.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.666
Where do the other clues lead?

15:58.749 --> 16:02.211
You're asking me for
the location of the treasure?

16:02.294 --> 16:04.713
No, we are asking where
a killer might be headed.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.840
Have you been listening
to anything I've said?

16:06.924 --> 16:09.218
Look, even if you could prove

16:09.301 --> 16:11.553
that all three codes
have been solved--

16:11.637 --> 16:14.640
which you haven't-- I can't
just give you the answers.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.183
That would be cheating.

16:16.266 --> 16:17.851
Dad, let it go.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.728
This isn't about
your hunt anymore.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.105
No, it's about principle.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.357
If NCIS wants
my treasure,

16:23.440 --> 16:24.900
you'll have to find it yourself.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.290
So, wait, so he
refused to help us?

16:40.374 --> 16:43.085
Well, it seems Angus DeMint
is very protective

16:43.168 --> 16:44.253
of his treasure hunt.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.964
And how did Gibbs take that?

16:44.336 --> 16:46.964
Not well.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.257
TORRES:
So, uh,

16:48.340 --> 16:50.134
did he arrest the guy?

16:48.340 --> 16:50.134
He wanted to,

16:50.217 --> 16:54.304
but Angus is neither
a witness or a suspect,

16:54.388 --> 16:55.973
and we can't prove

16:56.056 --> 16:58.767
the treasure is material
evidence in our murder case.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.144
So he's not
legally obligated

17:00.227 --> 17:02.271
to tell us where it is.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.606
It's too bad.
That's a lot of money.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.276
We'll, it's not like
we get to keep it anyway.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.902
Uh, actually, we might.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.446
If we happen
to discover the treasure

17:10.529 --> 17:12.281
during the course
of the investigation,

17:12.364 --> 17:13.782
and it's not used as evidence,

17:13.866 --> 17:16.118
falls under
U.S. treasure trove laws.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.161
Huh.

17:16.201 --> 17:17.161
Finders keepers, baby.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.746
That's right, baby.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.206
BISHOP:
Wait a minute. Did
you come in early

17:21.290 --> 17:23.959
just to look up the legal
statutes on buried treasure?

17:24.042 --> 17:25.127
No, I already knew those.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.129
I came in early
to start digging into

17:27.212 --> 17:29.256
this online
treasure-hunting community.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.300
So, six dudes
in their mom's basement?

17:31.383 --> 17:33.135
Try 6,000 active users

17:33.218 --> 17:36.472
in more than a hundred countries
and all 50 states here.

17:36.555 --> 17:37.681
Wow, that's a lot of basements.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.099
It's a lot of murder suspects.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.225
I mean, everyone on here
has dedicated

17:40.309 --> 17:43.228
years of their life
to finding the DeMint treasure.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.480
That's a lot of motive, too.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.775
Excuse me.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.195
Margot. Hi.

17:51.278 --> 17:53.280
Uh, can we help you?

17:53.363 --> 17:55.324
Actually, I was hoping
that I could help you.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.367
I'm sorry about my father.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.703
After you left last night,

17:59.787 --> 18:03.332
I tried to reason with him,
but it was no use.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.002
Please don't read that.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.546
There aren't a lot of people
who bury a million dollars.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.839
It's fascinating.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.966
More like delusional.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.552
When I was a kid,
my dad created all these codes

18:15.636 --> 18:18.680
and puzzles for me
to solve all the time.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.642
And my mom liked to bury
small items in the backyard

18:21.725 --> 18:26.647
and make clever treasure maps,
but it was all just silly fun.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.774
Every family has
their way of bonding, I guess.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.359
Well, hobbies
are healthy.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.819
But when my mom died,
Dad turned ours

18:31.902 --> 18:33.403
into a public spectacle,

18:33.487 --> 18:35.697
and he didn't even stop
to ask my opinion.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.658
And for someone
who encourages people

18:37.741 --> 18:41.370
to go outside and explore,
he just sits on his computer.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.915
And unless it's about the hunt,
he doesn't talk to me. I...

18:44.998 --> 18:47.543
I just want
this whole thing to be over.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.378
That's why I'm here.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.838
You said you could help?

18:50.921 --> 18:52.631
I secretly went
through Dad's computer.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.050
I didn't find
anything on the treasure.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.552
I did find some private chats

18:56.635 --> 18:58.345
Dad exchanged
with a group of followers.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.222
They meet
at a local gym.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.266
Maybe one of them
knows your victim.

19:02.349 --> 19:04.393
Yeah, I-I don't think
we can take those.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.061
Uh, though we appreciate
the hustle.

19:06.144 --> 19:07.938
You think my search was illegal.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.898
Well,

19:09.982 --> 19:12.234
uh, my name is on the deed
to the house,

19:12.317 --> 19:14.319
and the laptop
is in a shared space,

19:14.403 --> 19:17.906
so reasonable expectation
of privacy does not apply.

19:19.324 --> 19:23.287
In my professional opinion.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.707
Ah. You're a lawyer.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.084
Like your dad used to be.

19:29.167 --> 19:30.752
(laughs softly)

19:30.836 --> 19:32.421
I guess it runs in the family.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.427
After I got her kicked out
of 1 OAK, she called me out

19:38.510 --> 19:41.096
for getting a nose job
in front of Drake Bell.

19:41.179 --> 19:43.390
Can you believe that?
Just so Scorpio of her.

19:43.473 --> 19:45.434
Wait, you haven't seen it yet?

19:45.517 --> 19:46.643
My God, he did such a great job.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.270
No, it's so cute.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.272
Well, calm down,
I'll send you a selfie.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.272
Excuse me.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.274
No, I'll take one right now.

19:52.357 --> 19:55.027
Okay, one second.

19:52.357 --> 19:55.027
Uh, hello, ma'am?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.948
(gasps)

20:00.032 --> 20:02.201
Hey, watch the Gucci.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.827
Napkins, now.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.829
Chop-chop!

20:05.913 --> 20:08.457
I'll get 'em, hon.
Nice move, bud.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.541
KAREN:
Thanks, Dad.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.878
Ugh, look what you've done.

20:12.961 --> 20:15.255
This stain doesn't come out,
you're getting a bill.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.090
Well, you have a Beltway day.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.884
KAREN:
Can you believe that guy?

20:19.885 --> 20:21.011
MAN (over P.A.):
Order number 16.

20:21.094 --> 20:24.389
Big Bad Beltway.
Big Bad Beltway.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.183
Order three, pick up, please.

20:29.436 --> 20:31.355
How's your coffee today, sir?

20:31.438 --> 20:33.482
Cold.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.652
I'm very sorry to hear that.
(chuckles)

20:42.074 --> 20:44.451
Found those in
the freezer.

20:45.285 --> 20:46.453
I told you the
pills are being run

20:46.536 --> 20:48.288
through this place.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.541
I'm gonna need
more than pills, Tobias.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.503
Head of the snake, Mr. Big,
the guy in charge.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.005
Yeah, yeah, I know.
It's a work in progress.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.508
See who comes
for the drugs.

20:59.591 --> 21:01.885
What? Now you want me
to keep this job?

21:04.596 --> 21:06.556
Yeah.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.351
Well, that's very generous
of you, sir.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.019
You have a Beltway day.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.354
McGEE:
Margot said

21:12.437 --> 21:15.023
some of her dad's treasure
groupies meet here.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.359
Apparently the victim
wasn't the only climber.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.611
So much for, uh,
nerds in basements.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.822
(phone rings)

21:21.905 --> 21:23.532
Need to get that?

21:23.615 --> 21:25.367
No, it's the bar
from the other night.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.077
Why are they calling you?

21:25.450 --> 21:27.077
To apologize.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.704
What, did you tell them
about your bad tuna?

21:28.787 --> 21:30.664
No, I left
a one-star review on Yelp.

21:30.747 --> 21:31.873
SIMON:
Yo.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.375
Welcome to Top Out Climbing.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.501
I'll be your guide Simon.

21:34.584 --> 21:37.546
Let me guess, a couple gumbies
looking for a thrill?

21:37.629 --> 21:39.715
Or federal agents.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.675
We're looking for information
on this man.

21:41.758 --> 21:43.093
His name was
Diego Barnes.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.469
Is this about the fight?

21:45.595 --> 21:47.889
Well, that depends. What fight?

21:47.973 --> 21:50.684
Well, couple nights ago,
that dude and his two friends

21:50.767 --> 21:53.061
got into a shouting match
on a bouldering course.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.021
About what?

21:53.145 --> 21:54.021
Beats me,

21:54.104 --> 21:56.189
but it almost came to blows.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.065
You said two nights ago?

21:57.149 --> 21:59.401
Uh, yeah. Why?

21:57.149 --> 21:59.401
McGEE:
We're gonna need

21:59.484 --> 22:01.069
the information
on those other two climbers.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.238
Why not just talk to 'em?

22:03.321 --> 22:05.115
They're hitting
the Mega Slab right now.

22:05.198 --> 22:06.491
Thanks.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.412
Nice route, Cam. You crushed it.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.749
Not even close to my best time.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.917
You know, stepping through
that last foothold

22:16.001 --> 22:17.711
would have saved you
a few seconds.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.756
Uh, if I want beta,
I'll ask for it.

22:20.839 --> 22:22.299
Who the hell are you?

22:22.382 --> 22:25.135
NCIS. Special Agents
McGee and Torres.

22:25.218 --> 22:27.971
Oh.

22:28.055 --> 22:31.933
Camille West, Xander Price.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.268
Is this about Barnes?

22:33.351 --> 22:34.895
Xander told me
what happened.

22:34.978 --> 22:36.438
It's awful.

22:34.978 --> 22:36.438
XANDER:
Yeah, Diego and I

22:36.521 --> 22:37.731
have been friends for years.

22:37.814 --> 22:38.940
He was a good man.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.484
We're heartbroken.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.110
Hmm. You sure about that?

22:42.194 --> 22:43.653
McGEE:
We heard you got
into a fight

22:43.737 --> 22:45.447
the night he was murdered.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.950
Climbing gets frustrating.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.161
Tempers flare. It was nothing.

22:51.244 --> 22:53.163
A million-dollar treasure
isn't nothing.

22:53.246 --> 22:54.331
We know about the map.

22:55.499 --> 22:59.419
Our group meets here to compare
notes on the DeMint treasure.

22:59.503 --> 23:02.255
We've spent years
with no progress.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.341
Until two nights ago.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.635
Diego showed up bragging
about finding an answer key.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.470
To all three codes?

23:06.718 --> 23:08.470
He wouldn't tell us.

23:08.553 --> 23:09.971
And he refused
to share his map with us

23:10.055 --> 23:12.140
until he was sure he was right.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.809
That sounds like motive to me.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.809
What?

23:13.892 --> 23:16.311
No. We would never hurt him.

23:16.394 --> 23:18.271
Okay. Prove it.

23:18.355 --> 23:20.148
You both have alibis
for that night?

23:20.232 --> 23:21.441
Well...

23:21.525 --> 23:23.443
W-We were both at my place.

23:24.361 --> 23:25.862
Xander and I are dating.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.823
To avoid
any third wheel issues,

23:27.906 --> 23:30.700
we weren't telling
Barnes, but...

23:30.784 --> 23:32.452
we were together all night.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.162
Anyone who can verify that?

23:35.205 --> 23:36.248
No. Why?

23:36.331 --> 23:37.958
Well, because two suspects
in a crime

23:38.041 --> 23:40.001
can't be each other's alibis.

23:42.963 --> 23:46.675
Okay, uh, number 115.

23:46.758 --> 23:50.220
Word number 1-1-5 is...

23:50.303 --> 23:51.847
"Pumpernickel."

23:51.930 --> 23:53.515
Uh, I already have
a bad feeling.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.517
Read back the last sentence.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.520
Well, "Thy wet horse
slays pumpernickel."

23:58.603 --> 24:00.981
The hell are you two
talking about?

24:01.064 --> 24:04.359
Ugh, we're trying to
solve the DeMint codes.

24:04.442 --> 24:08.196
Since the killer is going
after the treasure, so are we.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.991
If NCIS can figure it out first,
we can lay in wait.

24:11.074 --> 24:13.201
(gasps)
Or set a trap.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.995
(chuckles):
Okay, Indy.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.997
The codes are in this book?

24:17.080 --> 24:18.248
KASIE:
Well, we thought so.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.292
Yeah, but the DeMint
codes are actually

24:20.375 --> 24:22.419
what are called book ciphers.

24:22.502 --> 24:24.337
Each number in the code
corresponds

24:24.421 --> 24:26.840
to a certain word
in a given book.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.884
Put them all together
and you get a complete sentence.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.468
Usually.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.468
BISHOP:
Yeah, so the trouble

24:30.552 --> 24:34.097
is finding out which book
is the cipher key.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.765
Luckily, we cheated.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.392
Since we knew the answer
to one of the codes

24:37.475 --> 24:38.894
was "Whitestone Gap,"
we could search

24:38.977 --> 24:41.062
for any published works
that reference that name,

24:41.146 --> 24:42.230
and there weren't many.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.400
One of them was from a book
of poetry from the 1800s,

24:45.483 --> 24:47.903
and that is how he
solved his first code.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.529
But when we tried it
with the other two codes,

24:49.613 --> 24:52.240
all we got was wet horses
and German bread.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.909
(tongue clicks)
Dead end.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.909
Okay.

24:53.992 --> 24:56.077
Tell me about the DNA.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.245
Another dead end.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.539
While I was able to run the
vomit from the crime scene,

24:59.623 --> 25:01.082
the profile wasn't
in the system.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.084
Come on, Kase, you got
to give me something.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.419
I wish I could.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.419
(computer chimes)

25:04.502 --> 25:07.547
Ooh. Wish granted.

25:07.631 --> 25:08.965
GIBBS: What do you got?

25:07.631 --> 25:08.965
KASIE: Cell tower records

25:09.049 --> 25:10.258
on the victim's
last phone call.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.761
It was made an hour
before he was killed.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.596
Who did he talk to?

25:12.844 --> 25:14.596
The number
was unlisted,

25:14.679 --> 25:17.098
so while I can't
tell you who answered...

25:17.182 --> 25:20.769
You can now tell us
where it was answered.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.395
Yep. Barnes' final phone call

25:22.479 --> 25:25.982
was routed to a tower
in the Virginia boonies.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.275
Uh, we were just there.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.319
That's right by
Angus DeMint's house.

25:29.402 --> 25:30.445
Coincidence?

25:30.528 --> 25:31.613
Well, either that

25:31.696 --> 25:35.617
or Angus talked to the victim
the night he was killed.

25:35.700 --> 25:36.993
He lied to us.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.084
(knocking on door)

25:42.207 --> 25:44.084
BISHOP:
Angus DeMint!

25:44.167 --> 25:46.878
NCIS! We've got a warrant!

25:48.255 --> 25:49.673
Federal agents!

25:58.515 --> 26:00.475
(door closes)

26:00.558 --> 26:02.102
House is clear.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.271
No sign of him.

26:04.354 --> 26:05.730
What happened here?

26:17.242 --> 26:18.660
BISHOP:
Well,

26:18.743 --> 26:22.664
it appears there was some sort
of a struggle, although

26:22.747 --> 26:25.166
you'd expect a ceramic lamp
to shatter

26:25.250 --> 26:29.671
when it hit the floor, and
there's not so much as a crack.

26:29.754 --> 26:34.676
Coffee table is overturned.
Nothing around it has moved.

26:34.759 --> 26:37.637
This... this was all staged.

26:37.721 --> 26:40.015
GIBBS:
Laptop is gone.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.726
His truck wasn't
in the garage.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.769
Angus is on the run.

26:44.853 --> 26:48.398
Because he lied to us
or because he's the killer?

26:48.481 --> 26:50.400
I'm not the one to ask.

26:50.483 --> 26:52.652
SLOANE:
This book

26:52.736 --> 26:55.613
is a series of essays
about Angus DeMint's life,

26:55.697 --> 26:57.532
from growing up poor
in New York City

26:57.615 --> 26:59.701
to meeting his wife Lillian.

26:59.784 --> 27:02.078
It's a charming love story.

26:59.784 --> 27:02.078
Jack, I didn't
ask for a review.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.914
I just wanted to know
why he's running.

27:04.998 --> 27:07.459
Love.

27:07.542 --> 27:10.211
Look, the majority of this book

27:10.295 --> 27:12.839
is about Lillian's
battle with cancer

27:12.922 --> 27:16.051
and the realization that money
and power aren't everything.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.053
Says the guy
who likes playing God.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.053
Exactly.

27:18.136 --> 27:20.680
The whole thing
is about control.

27:20.764 --> 27:22.891
Angus couldn't stop
his wife's death,

27:22.974 --> 27:26.603
so he created something that
practically made him omnipotent.

27:26.686 --> 27:27.812
The treasure hunt.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.064
Of course he doesn't
see it like that.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.690
To him, the hunt
is like, uh,

27:30.774 --> 27:32.692
a sacred memorial to his wife.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.694
A last link to her.

27:34.778 --> 27:38.073
And now someone has disrespected
that memory with murder.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.575
He's going after the killer?

27:38.156 --> 27:40.575
Angus likely wants

27:40.658 --> 27:43.787
to bring them
to justice himself.

27:43.870 --> 27:45.789
By not involving NCIS,

27:45.872 --> 27:47.624
he doesn't have
to ruin his treasure hunt.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.960
He wanted a head start.
That's why he lied.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.046
And that's why he created
the distraction at his house.

27:53.129 --> 27:55.215
Look, if Angus did talk
to the victim the night

27:55.298 --> 27:57.634
he was killed, he may already
have a suspect in mind.

27:57.717 --> 27:58.760
How do I find him, Jack?

27:59.886 --> 28:01.471
All you need is love.

28:01.554 --> 28:04.099
No, I-I-I'm not kidding.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.309
This book mentions
the one person

28:06.393 --> 28:08.728
who might be able to talk
some sense into him.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.193
Okay.

28:16.194 --> 28:17.862
Okay.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.865
(scraping)

28:25.870 --> 28:27.914
(phone ringing)

28:32.877 --> 28:34.337
Tobias.

28:34.421 --> 28:35.964
FORNELL:
Gibbs, I have to make this fast.

28:36.047 --> 28:38.675
I just found out the name
of our drug kingpin.

28:38.758 --> 28:40.593
Merriweather.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.137
That a first name or a last?

28:42.220 --> 28:44.139
It's an alias.

28:44.222 --> 28:46.433
I'll meet at the drive-through
in two days to explain.

28:46.516 --> 28:47.809
Tobias.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.984
(knocking on door)

28:59.863 --> 29:01.781
Hey.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.283
Hey, come on in.

29:03.366 --> 29:04.993
Evening, Agent Gibbs.

29:05.076 --> 29:07.871
Have a seat. Want something
to drink or something?

29:07.954 --> 29:09.497
Uh, thank you,

29:09.581 --> 29:10.832
but you didn't really
invite me over here

29:10.915 --> 29:12.292
for a friendly chat,

29:12.375 --> 29:13.626
did you?

29:16.754 --> 29:18.256
You think I know
where my dad is.

29:19.382 --> 29:20.842
I think you can
help us find him.

29:20.925 --> 29:23.011
How?

29:23.094 --> 29:25.930
I already tried calling
and-and messaging him,

29:26.014 --> 29:27.807
and he's not replying.

29:27.891 --> 29:30.560
And even if he did,
he doesn't listen to me.

29:30.643 --> 29:32.979
Clearly, I don't know
my father anymore.

29:33.062 --> 29:35.523
Yeah, but you still
care about him.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.734
Yes.

29:37.817 --> 29:40.028
He's the only family I've got.

29:41.988 --> 29:44.157
And I'm terrified of losing him,

29:44.240 --> 29:48.870
but... well, maybe
it's already too late.

29:48.953 --> 29:51.539
Nah. Never too late for family.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.541
(laughs)

29:53.625 --> 29:56.044
You read his book?

29:58.922 --> 30:02.050
Yeah, a friend
recommended it to me.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.260
He talks about you a lot.

30:06.137 --> 30:08.139
He cares, too.

30:09.140 --> 30:12.352
Oh. Dad wrote it ten years ago.

30:12.435 --> 30:13.728
Things change.

30:13.811 --> 30:15.730
Yeah.

30:15.813 --> 30:18.900
Not about that.
It doesn't, trust me.

30:22.111 --> 30:24.656
Ah, this seems like forever ago.

30:27.825 --> 30:30.787
This is the last picture
we took as a family.

30:30.870 --> 30:33.748
Before Mom got too sick
to leave the house.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.751
That a hiking trip?

30:35.041 --> 30:36.751
Mm-hmm.

30:36.834 --> 30:38.920
Blue Ridge Mountains.

30:39.003 --> 30:41.339
This was Mom's favorite spot.

30:43.383 --> 30:44.592
Wait.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.762
Agent Gibbs,

30:47.845 --> 30:50.306
this photo was taken
in Whitestone Gap.

30:53.017 --> 30:55.770
TORRES:
So this picture shows
where the treasure is buried?

30:55.853 --> 30:57.730
That's what Kasie and I
are trying to find out.

30:57.814 --> 30:59.816
Man, people were looking
for this treasure for ten years,

30:59.899 --> 31:01.818
and it was
in this guy's book all along?

31:01.901 --> 31:03.653
McGEE:
This is insane.

31:03.736 --> 31:07.949
Who needs A.E.S. encryption and
htaccess password protection?

31:08.032 --> 31:09.075
Uh, is that rhetorical?

31:08.032 --> 31:09.075
No.

31:09.158 --> 31:10.285
I'm trying to hack

31:10.368 --> 31:11.786
into Angus DeMint's
private chats.

31:11.869 --> 31:12.996
On the treasure hunter
message boards?

31:13.079 --> 31:14.455
McGEE:
It's how he communicates

31:14.539 --> 31:15.873
with his followers.

31:15.957 --> 31:18.084
I'm thinking the messages
might tell us where he is.

31:18.167 --> 31:19.627
Okay, so what's the problem?

31:18.167 --> 31:19.627
Well, I have a warrant,

31:19.711 --> 31:21.754
but in order
to actually read the chats,

31:21.838 --> 31:23.298
I've got to get
into a root server

31:23.381 --> 31:25.133
that is built like Fort Knox.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.968
(phone ringing)

31:27.051 --> 31:28.970
Oh, are you kidding?
They're calling again.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.097
Who?

31:29.053 --> 31:31.097
The bar.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.516
What? Is it still
about the bad tuna?

31:33.600 --> 31:36.477
No. That's... that's not why
they're leaving me voice mails.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.813
Apparently, I have
to take care of some bar tab.

31:38.896 --> 31:39.939
You didn't even drink.

31:38.896 --> 31:39.939
I know.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.941
That's why it's got
to be a mistake.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.026
All right. I'm in.

31:43.109 --> 31:44.819
Looks like Sloane was right.

31:44.902 --> 31:46.821
Angus had a suspect.

31:44.902 --> 31:46.821
Who?

31:46.904 --> 31:48.031
He's been chatting
with Camille West.

31:48.114 --> 31:50.116
That's the woman
from the climbing gym.

31:50.199 --> 31:51.868
According to this last message,
they're planning to meet.

31:51.951 --> 31:54.871
TORRES: Where?

31:51.951 --> 31:54.871
CAMILLE: I told you,
I don't know anything

31:54.954 --> 31:55.997
about Barnes's death.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.041
Then why did he call me
that night?

31:58.124 --> 32:01.002
And how did he get
my number?

31:58.124 --> 32:01.002
I gave it to him.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.503
He said he found
a cipher key,

32:02.587 --> 32:04.130
but he wouldn't
show it to us

32:04.213 --> 32:06.966
until he confirmed
with you. That's all.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.551
What about Xander?

32:09.594 --> 32:11.179
I told the agents

32:11.262 --> 32:14.641
that Xander was at my place
the night of the murder.

32:14.724 --> 32:17.352
But I was just trying
to cover for both of us.

32:17.435 --> 32:20.730
I lied.
I have no idea where Xander was.

32:20.813 --> 32:21.981
Could he have
something

32:22.065 --> 32:23.358
to do with this?

32:23.441 --> 32:25.485
That's a good question.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.485
You're under arrest

32:25.568 --> 32:27.570
for obstruction of justice,
both of you.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.405
What? I...

32:29.489 --> 32:31.199
I'm only trying to help.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.199
TORRES:
Well, that's great.

32:31.282 --> 32:33.701
Then you can come back
and help us at NCIS.

32:33.785 --> 32:37.580
I'm still not telling you
where my treasure's buried.

32:37.664 --> 32:39.040
We know where the treasure
is buried.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.042
You solved
the codes, Kase?

32:39.123 --> 32:41.042
Not at all.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.878
But we figured out where
the family photo was taken,

32:43.961 --> 32:46.714
and it was not easy-- there are
no landmarks in this picture,

32:46.798 --> 32:50.343
and it's not like we can run
facial recognition on the trees,

32:50.426 --> 32:52.428
so we cheated.

32:50.426 --> 32:52.428
Again.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.555
Margot said this was
her mom's favorite spot, right?

32:54.639 --> 32:57.016
So it makes sense that Angus
would go visit sometimes,

32:57.100 --> 32:58.393
to remember her.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.395
And if this is where
the treasure is buried,

33:00.478 --> 33:01.729
a control freak like Angus
would want

33:01.813 --> 33:03.356
to make sure it's still there.

33:03.439 --> 33:06.067
So we pulled the records from
his unregistered cell phone.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.361
Now, service is super spotty
out here,

33:08.444 --> 33:10.154
but in the last few years

33:10.238 --> 33:14.242
Angus used his cell phone
in Whitestone Gap six times,

33:14.325 --> 33:16.035
all in the same area.

33:16.119 --> 33:18.746
That's good work.

33:16.119 --> 33:18.746
Now, the
question is,

33:18.830 --> 33:20.832
does X really
mark the spot?

33:25.878 --> 33:28.089
You told us to find it.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.674
We did.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.428
I'm not saying a word
without a lawyer.

33:33.511 --> 33:34.971
You are a lawyer.

33:33.511 --> 33:34.971
First thing they teach you

33:35.054 --> 33:37.181
is, never represent yourself.

33:44.021 --> 33:45.398
(line rings)

33:45.481 --> 33:48.651
Hi. It's Margot.
Please leave a message.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.653
Margot, hi. It's Dad.

33:50.737 --> 33:52.113
Listen...

33:53.197 --> 33:54.907
I need a lawyer.

33:54.991 --> 33:57.201
Call me back.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.954
Look, I don't know
why we're in here.

34:00.037 --> 34:02.039
I already found your killer.

34:02.123 --> 34:04.167
His name is Xander Price.

34:04.250 --> 34:06.961
You don't need me
or my treasure.

34:07.044 --> 34:08.963
You didn't tell her
where you are.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.298
Margot?

34:10.381 --> 34:11.966
I don't want her to worry.

34:12.049 --> 34:13.426
Too late for that.

34:13.509 --> 34:14.969
You talked to her?

34:16.721 --> 34:18.806
Is she upset?

34:18.890 --> 34:20.141
About a lot of things.

34:21.934 --> 34:24.645
You met her two days ago.

34:24.729 --> 34:27.648
You... you don't know anything
about my daughter.

34:27.732 --> 34:29.776
I know that she's standing
right in front of you,

34:29.859 --> 34:32.195
and you're out burying treasure.

34:34.405 --> 34:36.240
(phone ringing)

34:41.245 --> 34:43.331
Your lawyer.

34:44.624 --> 34:46.876
Hi, honey. Listen, I...

34:46.959 --> 34:49.170
MARGOT:
No, Dad, I need you to listen.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.380
No. L-Look, look,
I can explain everything.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.174
(Margot gasps)

34:51.464 --> 34:53.174
Uh...

34:54.717 --> 34:56.010
M-Margot, are you there?

34:56.094 --> 34:57.345
MAN:
She's here.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.680
Who is this?

34:59.764 --> 35:01.682
The man pointing a gun
at your daughter's head.

35:01.766 --> 35:05.770
Tell me where the treasure is,
and I might let her live.

35:16.405 --> 35:18.157
Hey. Got your text.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.701
What's going on?

35:18.241 --> 35:20.701
Our killer is
on the other end

35:20.785 --> 35:23.204
of Gibbs' phone-- he's
got Margot at gunpoint.

35:20.785 --> 35:23.204
What?

35:23.287 --> 35:24.997
Does he know
who he called?

35:23.287 --> 35:24.997
I don't know,

35:25.081 --> 35:26.749
but we need to run
a trace-- now.

35:25.081 --> 35:26.749
Okay.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.668
ANGUS:
I just don't understand
what's going on.

35:28.751 --> 35:29.544
I mean, what is this?

35:29.627 --> 35:31.254
MAN: Tell me where
the money is buried.

35:31.337 --> 35:32.547
I know who you are, Xander.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.757
It's not me
you should be worried about.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.551
No more games.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.845
Look, how do I know
this isn't a game?

35:38.928 --> 35:40.513
Huh? Look, Margot,

35:40.596 --> 35:43.599
if you're trying to teach me
some lesson, you got me.

35:43.683 --> 35:44.600
No, Dad, it's not...

35:44.684 --> 35:45.852
(loud slap, Margot shrieks)

35:45.935 --> 35:47.436
MAN:
You want to keep playing?

35:47.520 --> 35:48.896
Don't you lay a hand on her!

35:48.980 --> 35:50.690
All right, look,
I'll give you what you want.

35:50.773 --> 35:52.191
All right?
I'll give you the coordinates.

35:52.275 --> 35:53.860
(quietly):
What are you doing?

35:53.943 --> 35:56.737
Your map was right.
You found it.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.240
Give him these.

35:59.323 --> 36:00.408
A fake location?

36:00.491 --> 36:01.576
I'm hanging up!

36:01.659 --> 36:03.744
O-Okay, all right, all right.

36:03.828 --> 36:04.704
(pants, stammers)

36:04.787 --> 36:06.539
I'm ready now.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.752
38 degrees, 52 minutes,

36:11.836 --> 36:14.297
14 seconds north.

36:14.380 --> 36:16.299
77 degrees,
zero minutes,

36:16.382 --> 36:19.302
nine seconds west.

36:19.385 --> 36:20.928
Give me landmarks.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.388
Hurry up!

36:22.471 --> 36:23.764
Okay, all right, um,

36:23.848 --> 36:24.932
it's-it's buried

36:25.016 --> 36:26.767
under an old shed.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.644
Is that good enough?

36:28.728 --> 36:30.605
Hello?

36:30.688 --> 36:33.399
If you try to follow me,
she dies.

36:33.482 --> 36:34.817
(click)

36:37.862 --> 36:40.281
What did I just do?

36:40.364 --> 36:43.159
What you should have done
from the start.

36:43.242 --> 36:45.036
Trust us.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.289
This is all my fault.

36:48.372 --> 36:49.916
Boss, I'm sorry,
we didn't get

36:49.999 --> 36:51.918
the trace in time.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.918
Don't worry
about it, McGee.

36:52.001 --> 36:53.836
We know where they're going.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.254
Where did you send them?

36:55.338 --> 36:57.757
Someplace with
home field advantage.

37:15.691 --> 37:18.152
Looks like your old man
was telling the truth.

37:18.235 --> 37:20.655
Let's hope he
doesn't try anything stupid.

37:20.738 --> 37:22.949
For your sake.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.803
Show me your hands.

37:52.019 --> 37:53.562
Get out.

37:59.735 --> 38:01.404
Why am I here?

38:01.487 --> 38:02.863
Insurance.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.740
And to dig.

38:09.704 --> 38:12.039
The old shed.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.874
Now.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.379
Hello?

38:18.462 --> 38:20.506
Anybody home?

38:21.757 --> 38:23.926
So, what is
this place, huh?

38:24.010 --> 38:25.720
Who lives here?

38:25.803 --> 38:27.763
My guess...

38:27.847 --> 38:29.890
Jeremiah Johnson.

38:29.974 --> 38:30.891
Who?

38:30.975 --> 38:32.852
(rustling)

38:30.975 --> 38:32.852
(animal chittering)

38:35.104 --> 38:37.106
Keep moving.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.121
Okay, so where do
we start digging?

39:00.463 --> 39:02.381
What the hell is that?

39:02.465 --> 39:04.258
Is that some kind
of code?

39:05.301 --> 39:06.594
Yeah.

39:06.677 --> 39:07.928
It's Morse code.

39:08.012 --> 39:09.847
Well, is it
about the money?

39:09.930 --> 39:11.640
Does it say where to dig?

39:13.225 --> 39:14.852
What does it say?!

39:16.395 --> 39:18.272
(gunshots)

39:16.395 --> 39:18.272
TORRES:
NCIS!

39:18.355 --> 39:19.899
Do not move!

39:19.982 --> 39:21.901
You all right?

39:19.982 --> 39:21.901
I am now.

39:21.984 --> 39:23.027
(groans)

39:23.986 --> 39:25.738
Thanks for the heads-up.

39:25.821 --> 39:26.947
(Simon panting)

39:27.031 --> 39:28.699
For your information...

39:30.034 --> 39:32.328
...it says, "Duck."

39:32.411 --> 39:34.914
(panting)

39:34.997 --> 39:36.957
He was waiting for me
in the parking garage

39:37.041 --> 39:38.375
outside my apartment building.

39:38.459 --> 39:40.628
I didn't see him
until it was too late.

39:40.711 --> 39:41.962
Who was that guy?

39:42.046 --> 39:44.090
The gym receptionist.

39:44.173 --> 39:47.259
A gym receptionist with a
pretty serious gambling problem.

39:47.343 --> 39:48.969
Did some digging--
turns out Simon Felcher

39:49.053 --> 39:51.514
owed a lot of money
to a lot of very bad people.

39:51.597 --> 39:53.015
TORRES:
Nothing a treasure

39:53.099 --> 39:54.642
wouldn't solve, I guess.

39:54.725 --> 39:56.811
See, I'm thinking he overheard
the climbers at the gym

39:56.894 --> 39:58.813
arguing about solving the map,

39:58.896 --> 40:01.107
so he followed Barnes home,
threatened him.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.442
But instead of handing over
years of hard work,

40:03.526 --> 40:05.027
Barnes swallowed it.

40:05.111 --> 40:07.655
And Simon got the map back,
but it was incomplete.

40:07.738 --> 40:08.823
So he went after me.

40:08.906 --> 40:11.617
He skipped the journey and
went right to the destination.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.119
Guess he didn't read
your dad's book.

40:13.202 --> 40:14.620
(Torres and Margot chuckle)

40:14.703 --> 40:16.122
Hey, for what it's worth,

40:16.205 --> 40:17.957
he truly was worried about you.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.000
And now that I'm safe,

40:20.084 --> 40:21.961
Dad'll go right back
to his treasure hunt.

40:22.044 --> 40:24.004
I'm not so sure
about that.

40:24.088 --> 40:26.090
(vehicle approaching)

40:29.176 --> 40:30.386
Wha...? Oh.

40:30.469 --> 40:32.012
Thank God.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.806
Dad.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.806
Thank God!

40:39.103 --> 40:40.354
Honey.

40:41.438 --> 40:43.107
I'm so sorry.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.152
For everything.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.035
JIMMY:
So, Margot and her dad
dug it up?

40:55.119 --> 40:56.537
KASIE:
Mm-hmm. They decided
to end the hunt

40:56.620 --> 40:59.540
together and use the money
to form a foundation

40:59.623 --> 41:01.750
in her mother's name.

41:01.834 --> 41:04.003
The real treasure was
each other.

41:01.834 --> 41:04.003
Mm.

41:04.086 --> 41:04.962
(mock retch)

41:05.045 --> 41:07.006
Well, no, I always say it.

41:07.089 --> 41:09.717
Life is just about spending time
with loved ones.

41:07.089 --> 41:09.717
Mm-hmm.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.553
Stop.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.553
Well, then
you're gonna love this.

41:12.636 --> 41:14.555
I finally went back to the bar.

41:14.638 --> 41:16.724
Oh, did you ever find out
who opened that mystery tab

41:16.807 --> 41:17.975
in your name?

41:16.807 --> 41:17.975
Yes.

41:19.101 --> 41:20.269
Me.

41:20.352 --> 41:21.478
(Kasie laughs)

41:21.562 --> 41:23.439
I don't remember you drinking.

41:23.522 --> 41:25.065
Granted, I don't remember much

41:25.149 --> 41:26.692
from that night.

41:25.149 --> 41:26.692
I didn't use

41:26.775 --> 41:27.943
the tab to pay for drinks.

41:28.027 --> 41:29.570
I used the tab to pay

41:29.653 --> 41:30.821
for the bar photographer.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.281
But I was having
such a good time,

41:32.364 --> 41:33.574
I just completely forgot.

41:33.657 --> 41:35.367
There are pictures?

41:35.451 --> 41:36.911
There are pictures?

41:36.994 --> 41:38.120
Yeah.

41:36.994 --> 41:38.120
Was this before

41:38.204 --> 41:39.538
or after I allegedly sang
Dolly Parton

41:39.622 --> 41:40.581
in front of Gibbs?

41:40.664 --> 41:42.041
This was taken

41:42.124 --> 41:43.959
just before.

41:44.043 --> 41:45.961
(laughs)

41:44.043 --> 41:45.961
KASIE:
Oh...

41:46.045 --> 41:49.256
(Jimmy and Kasie laughing)

41:55.137 --> 41:56.305
Morning, sir.

41:56.388 --> 41:58.140
It'll be $1.59, please.

42:02.019 --> 42:03.938
Where's the, uh, usual guy?

42:04.021 --> 42:07.399
Toby? He has not shown up
for work the last two days.

42:10.194 --> 42:11.487
You know him?

42:11.570 --> 42:13.948
Nope.

42:14.031 --> 42:17.243
Shame. Never can keep
the good ones around.

42:17.326 --> 42:19.119
Coffee, sir.

42:19.203 --> 42:22.039
Thank you, sir.
Have a Beltway day.
