00:01.035 --> 00:03.504
- Previously,
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

00:03.537 --> 00:05.273
- I'm in wedding mode, baby.
I'm rock solid.

00:05.306 --> 00:08.076
- [humming]
Just think it looks so chic.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.377
- Do you want to come
to your brother's wedding?

00:09.410 --> 00:12.380
- Of course I do, but I don't
have a lot of money.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.282
- If we could take care
of your flights and stuff--

00:14.315 --> 00:15.383
- Is this--is this real?

00:15.416 --> 00:16.250
- Yeah, we're not
messing around.

00:16.284 --> 00:17.651
- Listen, is it cool if
all three of you

00:17.685 --> 00:19.187
get time off work?
- That's fine.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.421
That's no problem.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.390
- Shay is in the studio
all of the time.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.092
Nothing else to do. Shay was in
the studio all night.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.260
I was fifth wheel
a lot this weekend

00:26.294 --> 00:27.528
'cause I know you were busy--
- Yeah.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.263
- Finishing that stuff
in the studio.

00:29.297 --> 00:32.266
- We are in the woods.
- Hello!

00:32.300 --> 00:35.403
- Oh, my God!
[all shouting]

00:35.436 --> 00:38.406
So happy you're here!
- Yay!

00:38.439 --> 00:40.408
- What up, dude?
- I'm shedding a tear.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.176
- Are you crying?
- I'm shedding a tear!

00:42.210 --> 00:43.611
- Guess who missed his flight?
- Sandoval.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.114
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.615
- Here we are.
- Can't believe we're actually

00:47.648 --> 00:49.417
here and it's actually
happening.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.585
And I'm bloody ordaining it.
How did this happen?

00:51.619 --> 00:54.322
- I got to call Sandoval.
- Wait, what's wrong?

00:54.355 --> 00:56.290
- F---ing brothers
missed their flight.

00:56.324 --> 00:59.293
Are you f---ing kidding?
Your f---ing brother's wedding?

00:59.327 --> 01:00.661
What the f--- is wrong with you?
- Shh!

01:00.694 --> 01:04.198
[Dena Deadly's
"Raise Your Glass"]

01:04.232 --> 01:07.868
- * You know
that it's our time *

01:07.901 --> 01:10.171
* These are the best days

01:10.204 --> 01:13.174
* Of our lives

01:13.207 --> 01:16.110
* Just raise
your glasses high *

01:16.144 --> 01:21.215
* This one's
for you tonight *

01:21.249 --> 01:23.651
- * We belong together

01:23.684 --> 01:28.189
* Oh, oh, take my heart
and fold it, baby *

01:28.222 --> 01:29.557
- We kind of talked about this
last night.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.192
I'll just go over it
real quick.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.527
We can just do like long
blankets out here.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.596
We'll set up buffet kind of
in this area too,

01:35.629 --> 01:37.331
with the whole taco bar,
and just leave it open

01:37.365 --> 01:39.200
for a couple hours for people
to kind of graze

01:39.233 --> 01:40.534
and help themselves.
- Love it.

01:40.568 --> 01:43.337
- So for hour rehearsal dinner,
we decided to go

01:43.371 --> 01:45.239
more understated, you know?

01:45.273 --> 01:47.141
We wanted it to be
casual and fun.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.476
- Let's go over, um,
this way, you guys,

01:48.509 --> 01:50.411
and we'll go look at the
reception area real quick.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.680
- It's Taco Tuesday.
We love tacos.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.349
- Your officiant, Lisa,
do you want her to walk--

01:55.383 --> 01:57.251
be a part of the processional,
or do you want her

01:57.285 --> 01:58.652
to just be standing,
staged up there?

01:58.686 --> 02:00.721
- Lisa doesn't really walk.
She floats, by the way.

02:00.754 --> 02:01.589
Just...
- [laughs]

02:01.622 --> 02:03.357
- So we can ask her what
she wants to do.

02:03.391 --> 02:04.725
She's gonna be here
for the rehearsal?

02:04.758 --> 02:06.627
- Yeah.
I feel very calm.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.530
Tom and I have gone
through so much

02:09.563 --> 02:12.733
and planned this beautiful
destination wedding,

02:12.766 --> 02:16.570
and now we're finally here, and
I'm going to marry my Bubba.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.172
I'm gonna go get ready before

02:18.206 --> 02:19.373
everyone else starts
to get here.

02:19.407 --> 02:20.708
- Okay. All right, Bubba.
- All right.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.743
- She's cool.
- Also.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.579
May have had a little num-na
of an edible this morning,

02:25.613 --> 02:27.648
so I'm feeling pretty relaxed.

02:27.681 --> 02:31.185
- My kid!
- Oh, my God!

02:31.219 --> 02:33.654
Mama Dukes, hey.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.424
I'm gonna cry.
- You look handsome.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.591
How's my boy?

02:37.625 --> 02:40.228
- It's so special for me
to have my mom here.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.663
Like, I love her deeply,
and we're very close.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.232
Have we ever done
a shot together?

02:44.265 --> 02:45.666
- Honey, is that real?
I was thinking like--

02:45.699 --> 02:47.401
- It's Fireball.
You get the small one.

02:47.435 --> 02:48.402
Ready?
- Yeah.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.438
- Um...
- To my handsome buck!

02:50.471 --> 02:51.439
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.341
- I don't get to see you lot,
but I love you

02:53.374 --> 02:54.542
more than you could
possibly imagine.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.210
- Okay.
- I really do.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.346
- And we'll do this for Grandpa
Woody and your dad.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.547
- Okay. [laughs]
- To you.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.215
- And the boys.
- And the boys!

03:01.249 --> 03:02.550
- I would love
to have my brothers

03:02.583 --> 03:03.784
and sister and my dad here.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.553
Can't afford
to fly 'em all out,

03:05.586 --> 03:07.288
so having her at the wedding

03:07.321 --> 03:08.789
is just that much more special.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.624
- Ah!
- Look at you!

03:10.658 --> 03:11.759
both: [roaring]
- I'm ready.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.294
- You're not a drinker.
- I'm not.

03:13.327 --> 03:14.462
- You're not. [laughing]

03:14.495 --> 03:15.696
Come on, we'll get you a joint.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.431
- All right.
- You're not a smoker either.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.666
We'll get you a glass of wine.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.301
We're gonna go tubing
in a little bit.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.635
You want to go tubing? [laughs]
You want to go?

03:21.669 --> 03:23.704
- No.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.239
- I'm trying to get
ahold of Tom.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.508
The brothers missed
their f---ing flight.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.009
- Missed it?
- He has all their

03:29.042 --> 03:31.279
flight itinerary information.
- He might be on--let me--

03:31.312 --> 03:32.546
- I can't get ahold of him.
- I keep calling him--

03:32.580 --> 03:34.382
- We keep trying to FaceTime,
but we can't get ahold of him.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.549
- I'm gonna go get my phone.
I'll be right back.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.618
- Okay, and if you text him,
just text him to call us.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.453
- Yeah.
- I couldn't think of anything

03:39.487 --> 03:41.522
more worse...
sorry, is that a word?

03:41.555 --> 03:43.457
More worse?
No, is that--is that right?

03:43.491 --> 03:45.459
I couldn't think of any--
no, that's not right.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.595
More worse? That's not--
that doesn't sound right.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.864
Is it? Is that right?
More worse?

03:50.898 --> 03:52.600
Can I Google that?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.768
Is that right?
Worse? More worse.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.270
I couldn't think--

03:56.304 --> 03:59.540
I couldn't think
of anything worse!

03:59.573 --> 04:01.742
No, that's not right either.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.745
More worse.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.381
I couldn't think of anything
that could suck more.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.749
You have one job!

04:08.782 --> 04:11.319
One job!
F---ing asshole.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.354
Do you know how much money we
spent on those f---ing flights?

04:13.387 --> 04:14.788
They don't have a dollar
to their name,

04:14.822 --> 04:15.689
so now I got to pay for it.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.558
I could see
if it's one person, okay.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.760
Two people, not really.
But three of you?

04:19.793 --> 04:20.794
- I know.
- To sit through--

04:20.828 --> 04:22.029
are you f---ing kidding?

04:23.664 --> 04:24.732
This is a big deal because this
is Schwartz's wedding present,

04:25.733 --> 04:27.267
and it has to go right,
and all they had to do

04:28.302 --> 04:29.303
was show up on time,
and they couldn't do that.

04:30.170 --> 04:30.804
- Oh, it's Taco Tuesday!
Dude, we got--

04:31.672 --> 04:33.474
we got mini, um, f---ing
sombreros too.

04:33.507 --> 04:33.541
both: Yeah.
- My mom got here.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.511
And I burst into tears and then
we did a shot of Fireball.

04:37.545 --> 04:38.679
- Aw, you cried?

04:39.747 --> 04:40.448
- I've never taken a shot with
my mom in my life.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.350
- Schwartz, right now,
since Katie's not here,

04:43.216 --> 04:43.684
we're gonna--we're gonna
do it to you.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.319
- I can't accept that.
- To the groom!

04:46.253 --> 04:46.687
- I'd be shady--all right.
- He's so sweet!

04:47.655 --> 04:48.689
- Yeah, you can.
- The biggest thing for me,

04:49.723 --> 04:50.891
being a bridesmaid,
is going to be making sure

04:52.159 --> 04:53.527
everyone's in a good mood
and having a good time.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.396
Get everybody to party.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.597
[all shouting]

04:56.630 --> 04:59.567
- Love you, love you,
love you, love you!

04:59.600 --> 05:00.701
- Ow!

05:00.734 --> 05:03.637
- Schwartz is
in very good spirits.

05:03.671 --> 05:04.705
- Yeah.
- This is gonna be a lot of fun.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.941
The rehearsal dinner,
we got a piÃ±ata and tacos.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.911
Tubing!
- Oh, yeah, we gotta go tubing.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.946
- I really don't know
what's going on with Shay.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.684
I don't know if he's tired,
if he's not feeling well,

05:16.717 --> 05:18.952
if he's doing something else
I don't know about.

05:18.986 --> 05:22.756
His behavior lately
has just been off.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.858
I'm so happy for them, though.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.561
- Yup.

05:27.595 --> 05:28.962
Good times.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.499
- * Hey! Hey!

05:31.532 --> 05:32.800
- Ah, a bug!

05:32.833 --> 05:35.569
- This is like
the craziest thing ever.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.371
- This is a bitch to get here.

05:37.405 --> 05:38.839
*

05:38.872 --> 05:41.442
- * Whoa, whoa

05:42.710 --> 05:44.144
- Whoo!

05:44.177 --> 05:46.714
- Yo, this is the best group
activity we've ever done.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.417
- Don't want this water
to dingy my diamond.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.451
*

05:50.484 --> 05:51.685
- Whoo!

05:51.719 --> 05:53.387
- Bye!

05:53.421 --> 05:55.823
- This is awesome! Whoo-hoo!

05:55.856 --> 05:59.493
- This group of friends,
it's a f---ing crazy train.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.828
As much as we have hated,
and fought,

06:00.861 --> 06:02.463
and thrown each other
under the bus,

06:02.496 --> 06:04.164
and whether we all
may not be, like,

06:04.197 --> 06:06.434
completely in love
with one another,

06:06.467 --> 06:07.635
we are in love
with Katie and Tom.

06:07.668 --> 06:12.440
And we're, like, actually
going to their wedding tomorrow.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.607
F---.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.676
- [gasps] There's a bug!
That was a bug!

06:15.709 --> 06:18.879
Wait, what the--
- So many bugs!

06:18.912 --> 06:22.015
- Leeches? It's an actual leech?

06:22.049 --> 06:25.519
I don't like bugs.
I don't like dirt.

06:25.553 --> 06:29.623
Who does?
Who likes bugs and dirt?

06:29.657 --> 06:30.891
Gross, they probably
are leeches.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.192
I don't want Lyme disease, guys.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.562
I don't want diseases
in general.

06:34.595 --> 06:41.435
*

06:41.469 --> 06:42.736
[sighs]

06:42.770 --> 06:44.672
I mean, this is like
the first flight

06:44.705 --> 06:47.975
I've ever missed.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.943
Okay, I'm lying.
I've missed tons of flights.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.012
But not in a while.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.881
And not for important sh--.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.750
- Hey, you guys, stop!
- Are we stopping?

06:56.784 --> 06:58.586
Oh, 'cause we have to walk back?

06:58.619 --> 07:00.521
- We got to go around.
- Dude.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.890
*

07:02.923 --> 07:05.025
- I'm sorry that we didn't get
to go down longer.

07:05.058 --> 07:07.728
- Tom!
- God?

07:07.761 --> 07:09.763
- Ah!
- God, is that you?

07:09.797 --> 07:11.665
- [laughing]
- Ah!

07:11.699 --> 07:14.668
- Oh! Oh!
I'm so sorry.

07:14.702 --> 07:17.004
- Tom, just--
there's a lesson here.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.072
- I'm sorry, guys.
I actually--

07:19.106 --> 07:20.173
I got all the way
to the airport.

07:20.207 --> 07:23.977
I realized I forgot
my suit at home like an idiot.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.780
I get here, and I was gonna rent
a car anyways,

07:26.814 --> 07:27.915
but I had to rent an SUV.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.650
Do you know why I had
to rent an SUV?

07:29.683 --> 07:31.084
- Why?
- Only thing available?

07:31.118 --> 07:33.687
- Because what the hell else
am I gonna fit

07:33.721 --> 07:36.890
50 12-packs of Coors Light
and 10 cases of Blue Moon?

07:36.924 --> 07:39.893
- 50?
- 50. Yes.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.630
- And totally redeemed yourself!

07:42.663 --> 07:44.097
[laughing]

07:44.131 --> 07:47.701
- I love, love, love, love
Tom Sandoval.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.803
- Look at me: all that matters
is that you're here.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.505
- I know.
- Oh, sorry.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.006
- Ooh, hey.
- Cheers.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.575
All right, let's get
in the river.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.577
- Let's go now.
Let's go, buddy.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.911
- Get in there, drunkie.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.847
- Get on that pink
flamingo, bitch.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.916
- Here come on, now, come on.
Step into my office.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.718
- Ha ha! Yeah!

08:04.752 --> 08:06.654
- Dude, what's going on
with his brothers?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.589
- So, they got
to the airport late.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.757
They missed their flight,
so then

08:09.790 --> 08:11.692
they missed their
connecting flight.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.927
Which is really annoying,
but, like,

08:13.961 --> 08:15.763
who am I to f---ing talk?

08:15.796 --> 08:17.998
I missed my flight.
- Hey, what are you doing?

08:18.031 --> 08:19.833
- Hey, it wasn't one, okay?
It wasn't two.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.635
That--aw, man--
but there's three of 'em.

08:21.669 --> 08:24.137
- Their flight lands at 6:05.
- Oh.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.674
We might still even be at dinner
when they get here.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.141
- Yeah. Okay.
- I mean, Schwarz is over there

08:28.175 --> 08:30.711
floating on a pink flamingo.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.613
He's kind of having
the time of his life.

08:32.646 --> 08:35.082
- Ah! Ah!

Don't you?

08:48.929 --> 08:51.131
- Love the creek.
- It's so romantic.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.769
This is so Katie,
it's unbelievable.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.137
I have no idea
how she found this place.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.138
- I love it.

[train whistle tooting]

It's the train coming now.

Holy cow, I hope
that doesn't come

09:07.948 --> 09:09.917
right in the middle
of the service.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.185
I feel like I need to talk
to Tom and Katie

09:12.219 --> 09:16.023
about this, because they've had
no input in it at all,

09:16.056 --> 09:17.257
and they might hate it.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.927
I'm a little bit nervous because
I'm officiating the wedding,

09:19.960 --> 09:21.929
but I've had no direction
whatsoever.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.897

do you f---er

and spend

09:24.998 --> 09:27.067

They have no idea!

Hello!

09:33.974 --> 09:36.910
- Look at the train!
- I love this here.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.912
- Our present's on
the last carriage.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.681
- You look gorgeous.
- Hey.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.651
Thank you so much for coming.
- Oh, sure.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.819
- Mwah! Is this happening?
You got to pinch me--

- Pinch me. Is this real?

[train clacking]

09:49.890 --> 09:51.825
- I want to do whatever
you want.

09:51.859 --> 09:53.927
- Our thing is, like, not
to have it super long,

09:53.961 --> 09:56.964
drawn-out, but also
not make it, like,

09:56.997 --> 10:00.000
too fast and too,
like, blown over.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.737
What's your first line?

10:03.771 --> 10:05.906
- Oh, no.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.174
- You must have that down.

10:07.207 --> 10:10.010
- Um, I don't. Sh--.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.980
But I have the essence of it.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.733
didn't think Tom and I
would ever make it here.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.870

are searching for."

the ups and downs

10:40.908 --> 10:43.043
in Tom and I's relationship.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.946
I've never felt more myself
around anyone besides him.

to give it to me,

done something right.

of everyone here

to officiate our wedding.

in a forest.

- I've had my wedding planned

12:01.922 --> 12:03.757
since I was, like,
in middle school.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.994
There's a castle in Kentucky,
and I want to be married there.

12:07.027 --> 12:10.297
It's beautiful, and I want
red roses everywhere.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.300

in the wintery time.

- Whoa.

Wait, we're wearing jackets?

I didn't know
we were wearing jackets.

seven jackets with me.

Now, come on, baby.

you ladies first.

in order here,

take the guys.

We're gonna line up
right down there.

be right here.

- Oh, no. That's too close.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.277
- The only reason that Stassi is
standing next to Katie

12:57.310 --> 13:00.914
is because Sandoval and I
refused to walk together.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.850
It doesn't matter
where I stand.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.351
I know that I'm number one
in Katie's eyes.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.953
- Hey, are you gonna do one
of those to the crowd?

13:05.986 --> 13:07.487
Like this.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.957
If I was officiating
the wedding, it'd be a party.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.859
We'd have shots
right off the bat.

I'd be like, "Hey, swap rings.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.863
Give each other a little peck.
Let's party."

13:15.896 --> 13:17.965
I personally don't want to be
standing up there that long.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.366
I got bad knees.

Schwartz, Schwartz.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.538
Did it hit you like it hit me
when you saw the white chairs?

13:25.572 --> 13:28.275
- Dude, yeah.
- I have so many fond memories

13:28.308 --> 13:30.443
of when me and Jax and Schwartz
lived together.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.113
In fact, I remember
when Schwartz

13:33.146 --> 13:34.948
first brought Katie home.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.383
- I feel like I'm a guy
who's out of body

13:36.416 --> 13:37.985
watching another guy
getting married.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.519
- I'd plastered a bunch of porn

13:39.552 --> 13:41.021
all over the back of his door,

13:41.054 --> 13:44.457
so when she closed it,
she'd be sure to see it.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.860
And now,
they're getting married.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.128
Like, it's crazy.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.030
- Should we go eat?

13:50.063 --> 13:51.398
- Yeah!

- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, what's going on?

This is the moment I've been
looking forward to for so long.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.016
- Are those your dress slippers?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.350
I thought you had better ones
for tomorrow.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.886
- Katie vetoed that.
Trust me, I--

14:12.920 --> 14:14.454
I did say that, 'cause
I'm wearing the full tux.

14:14.487 --> 14:15.889
I said, "Bubba,
can I wear those?"

14:15.923 --> 14:17.357
And she said--
- You're wearing a tux?

14:17.390 --> 14:20.027
Like...sweatpants?
- A real tux. Custom-made tux.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.428
- Darling, would
you like a drink?

14:21.461 --> 14:22.930
- Would I like a drink?
Are you kidding me?

14:22.963 --> 14:24.064
I need a drink.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.999
- I mean, you can't really go
wrong with any of these.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.568
We're not driving.
Let's have a good time.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.338
Hey, any time I can schmooze Kim
is a win in my book.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.539
I mean, I have
a huge crush on her.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.007
Your little boy's
getting married.

14:34.041 --> 14:37.077
- I know, how often
can you say that?

14:37.110 --> 14:39.112
- Mother of the groom.
- Nice to meet you.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.014
I would marry Kim
just so Tom Schwartz

14:41.048 --> 14:42.115
would have to call me "Dad."

14:42.149 --> 14:43.450
- Can we just like have a moment

14:43.483 --> 14:45.953
to like, be like, "This is
f---ing happening."

14:45.986 --> 14:47.955
There's not gonna be another
time when, like,

14:47.988 --> 14:50.590
we have two best friends
that are marrying each other.

14:50.623 --> 14:53.493
I feel like the past, like,
seven years I've had with them

14:53.526 --> 14:55.362
is, like, flashing
before my eyes.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.663
- F---ing--
- Do not f---ing

14:56.696 --> 14:57.931
say "F--- you, bitch."

14:57.965 --> 14:58.999
- Are you serious?
- Stassi!

14:59.032 --> 15:01.534
What the f---
do you want from me?

15:01.568 --> 15:03.036
Shut the f--- up, Stassi.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.671
- You are a f---ing bitch.

15:04.704 --> 15:09.376
- I wonder if one of them
wrote me into their vows.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.477
It's possible.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.112
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.213
- Okay, cool.
- Hi, this is Tom's mom.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.482
- Mama Dukes, wait,
I want to give you something.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.550
I've gotten my mom cards
and little trinkets,

15:17.584 --> 15:19.052
but I feel like
I've never really

15:19.086 --> 15:21.488
gotten her anything nice.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.023
- Look at that.
- That's not real.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.624
- Yeah, with white diamonds
and rose gold.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.726
- Put it on.
- Yeah, of course.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.628
This is my mom,
who I love so much,

15:28.661 --> 15:30.497
and she's done so much for me.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.632
- It's so beautiful.
- Yeah.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.202
- I love it,
and I love the shape.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.604
- Not that a ring compensates
for all of that,

15:37.637 --> 15:39.239
but I just wanted something
for her to,

15:39.272 --> 15:40.440
uh, remember the moment by.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.010
You've been an amazing mom.
You've done so much for me.

- Was it one date?
Was it two?

15:50.550 --> 15:52.519
- Mom, it's been
like a lot of dates.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.088
- [gasps]
When do I get details?

15:55.122 --> 15:58.091
- Mom, I just like him.
- She does.

15:58.125 --> 16:01.094
- I just like him, and it's--
- Does he like you?

16:01.128 --> 16:04.431
- I hope so.
- So, how many dates

16:04.464 --> 16:06.633
before that special moment?

16:06.666 --> 16:08.268
Nine? Ten?
- This is uncomfortable.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.138
- Mom, it's 2016.
- 11. 12.

16:11.171 --> 16:15.542
- The first night, he went down
on me like seven times.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.178
And I cried two of the times
that I came.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.013
- We--we don't have to talk
about that part.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.715
- Yeah, we had a good time.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.152
And I cried.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.021
I don't know.
I can't control myself.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.223
Which is probably why he'll
never talk to me again.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.159
- Honey, he's not gonna
buy the cow

16:32.192 --> 16:35.228
if he can get the milk for free.

16:35.262 --> 16:37.464
[overlapping party chatter]

16:37.497 --> 16:39.766
- The triplets are here.
Right now.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.268
Waiting.

16:41.301 --> 16:43.203
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've just received word

16:43.236 --> 16:46.573
that the triplets have arrived.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.575
What's up, guys?
- Hey, Sandoval.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.543
- Sh--. All right, all right.
- You did great.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.612
This is--I couldn't have picked
something better myself.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.547
- All right, wait, wait, whoa.
Who's who?

16:54.581 --> 16:56.149
- Call my Billy.
- I'm Bert.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.650
- Bert. Brandon?
- Yeah.

16:57.684 --> 16:58.785
- Bert.
When it came to dressing

16:58.818 --> 17:02.189
the triplets, I mean these guys
don't own a dress belt,

17:02.222 --> 17:04.557
dress shoes, anything.

17:04.591 --> 17:07.194
So I had to put together not
only their wedding outfits,

17:07.227 --> 17:09.096
but also the outfits
they were gonna be wearing

17:09.129 --> 17:10.730
to the rehearsal dinner,
plus I wanted them

17:10.763 --> 17:13.533
to look good for when
Schwartz first sees them.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.635
- Yeah, man, how do--
- You guys look great, man.

17:15.668 --> 17:18.538
*

17:18.571 --> 17:20.307
- Who is hitting on my husband?

17:20.340 --> 17:21.508
- I know, I just--
- You did.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.643
I don't think
you could handle him.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.612
- Katie definitely
picked this place out.

17:25.645 --> 17:26.746
- [burps] Dude, Katie--
- What are you talking about?

17:26.779 --> 17:29.549
I feel like Tom was here
streaming up the lights himself.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.085
He 100% was here.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.820
- [laughs]
- Me and Jax, we wanted

17:33.853 --> 17:36.523
to give you your wedding present
a little early.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.757
- Okay, do you mind?
- I feel like--

17:37.790 --> 17:39.192
- Do you mind?
- It's not steaks that

17:39.226 --> 17:40.293
were between your butt cheeks--

17:40.327 --> 17:41.794
What the f---?

17:41.828 --> 17:43.863
- What's up?
- Oh, my God!

17:43.896 --> 17:45.732
Billy!
- What's up?

17:45.765 --> 17:47.634
- No way, dude.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.569
You guys did--
- Listen.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.870
- Yeah.
- We tried.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.772
We tried for all of 'em.
- What up?

17:52.805 --> 17:56.276
[laughing]
Brother, what's up, buddy?

17:56.309 --> 17:58.178
- See, you guys are
making me cry.

17:58.211 --> 18:01.114
Hey, man.
- Just wanted to...[laughs].

18:01.148 --> 18:03.650
[soft music]

18:03.683 --> 18:05.185
- Tom.
- Oh, this guy too.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.654
- We made it.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.822
- You can't have a wedding
without your brothers here, man.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.259
Come on, now.

18:12.292 --> 18:16.263
- [sniffs] Man--
oh, my God, man.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.165
[sobbing]
- [laughs]

18:18.198 --> 18:21.134
So...
- Dude, oh, man.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.203
My mind is just blown.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.372
And my brain's not even
processing it.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.274
I'm looking at them,
I know it's my brothers,

18:27.307 --> 18:29.909
but it's like my--
my mind won't accept it.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.644
Dude, this is amazing.
- You look great.

18:31.678 --> 18:34.281
- I texted you guys today!
I was like, "Holy sh--."

18:34.314 --> 18:36.183
- Tom and Jax told me
that they were going

18:36.216 --> 18:38.185
to fly Tom's brothers out,

18:38.218 --> 18:41.421
and I just knew how overcome

18:41.454 --> 18:43.190
with emotion Tom would be.

18:43.223 --> 18:46.859
So I was excited to keep
that secret from him.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.428
- I'm shocked.
- They're here.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.163
- Hi!
- How are you?

18:50.197 --> 18:52.699
- You guys look
all sharp and sh--.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.434
Did Tom dress you guys?
- Yeah.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.902
- Get over here, man.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.737
To see him so happy

18:57.770 --> 18:59.372
the day before his wedding

18:59.406 --> 19:01.174
is amazing.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.875
- Oh, my gosh, Lisa.
I forgot that you were here.

19:02.909 --> 19:05.178
- Oh, my God, I heard about it,

19:05.212 --> 19:07.247
and I was sworn to secrecy.
- You guys all knew about it?

19:07.280 --> 19:08.915
- The three of you, I need to
have a close look at you.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.317
Hold on a second.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.885
So you're absolutely
all identical.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.454
- Uh, do we look a like?

19:14.487 --> 19:15.722
- Can't believe that
they've brought

19:15.755 --> 19:17.390
his three brothers here.

19:17.424 --> 19:20.860
You see, there is some good
in Jax Taylor.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.396
You sometimes got to dig
really deep,

19:23.430 --> 19:24.797
but it's there somewhere.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.433
- Oh, my God, I can't even
believe you're here.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.801
How are so many great people
in my life here?

19:28.835 --> 19:31.204
- Oh, come on, dude.
You deserve it, man.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.806
- I will never, for as long
as I live, forget.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.210
It's truly the nicest thing that
anyone's ever done for me.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.845
- Jax!
- You little bastards.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.681
You little bastards, bring it in
for the good stuff, all right?

19:41.714 --> 19:43.216
I'm not gonna lie to you,
I swear to God,

19:43.250 --> 19:45.752
I wanted to kill
you mother----ers.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.254
I wanted to rip my teeth out.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.756
And then stick a spoon
in my eye.

19:49.789 --> 19:52.959
And then drag my body
behind a semi truck.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.694
That was what it was like

19:54.727 --> 19:56.429
booking those three
a plane ticket.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.997
- If you want to blame anybody,
blame him.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.367
- But my mission was
to get Tom to cry.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.768
Mission accomplished.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.304
- Oh, my God!
My brothers!

20:04.337 --> 20:06.773
- Coming up...
- I wanted to grab you

20:06.806 --> 20:08.441
by the scruff of the neck
and say,

20:08.475 --> 20:10.310
"What the f--- are you doing?"

20:13.913 --> 20:16.816
[overlapping party chatter]

20:16.849 --> 20:18.585
[upbeat music]

20:18.618 --> 20:20.787
- This is my brother, Rick.
- Oh, my goodness.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.889
So nice to meet you!
- Where's your hubby?

20:22.922 --> 20:23.890
- Uh, he was upstairs.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.793
He just wanted to lay
by the fan for a bit.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.796
[fan blowing]

20:29.829 --> 20:31.331
*

20:31.364 --> 20:32.965
He said, though,
the fresh water earlier,

20:32.999 --> 20:35.402
that it made his skin
feel better.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.437
- He was a rescue?
- With no fur.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.872
- You know when something's not
perfect and you love 'em anyway?

20:39.906 --> 20:41.708
The way you loved Jax?

20:41.741 --> 20:43.676
[laughter]

20:43.710 --> 20:44.777
- I'm so embarrassed.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.813
I don't know what happened
to me during that time.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.349
- If you're embarrassed, I'm not
here to tell you I told you so,

20:49.382 --> 20:50.983
but I told you so.
- [laughing]

20:51.017 --> 20:54.687
- [laughs] I always had
so much hope for you

20:54.721 --> 20:58.425
because you had a strength,
and a sharpness, and--

20:58.458 --> 21:03.430
and a sense of humor to see
the good things about life,

21:03.463 --> 21:06.599
and, um, and I felt that you
walked away from it,

21:06.633 --> 21:09.569
and I wanted to grab you by
the scruff of the neck

21:09.602 --> 21:11.671
and say, "What the f---
are you doing?

21:11.704 --> 21:13.005
Don't give it up."

21:13.039 --> 21:14.273
You're being ridiculous.

21:14.307 --> 21:16.876
You're not the girl that runs
away and hides in the corner.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.445
You're a strong woman.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.546
You know what I'm saying?

21:19.579 --> 21:20.813
- I'm sorry that I let you down.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.882
- Maybe you needed to grow up.

21:22.915 --> 21:26.886
Maybe you needed to find out
for yourself, you know?

21:26.919 --> 21:28.888
- I made mistakes,
but the only thing I can do

21:28.921 --> 21:30.523
is try and make it better.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.892
- Yeah.
Well, you have.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.027
You have, and I think
it takes a big person

21:35.061 --> 21:37.697
to say, "I've made mistakes."

21:37.730 --> 21:41.601
- It's nice to get a little
validation from Lisa.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.770
Her saying that,
that's like as big

21:43.803 --> 21:45.805
of a compliment
as she's gonna give me.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.507
And I really appreciate it.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.577
- Here you are.

21:50.610 --> 21:51.678
- This is beautiful.

21:51.711 --> 21:52.879
- I mean, everything's
taken care of.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.947
We got margaritas, and tacos,

21:54.981 --> 21:56.916
and the rehearsal's
all good to go.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.485
- We're good.

21:58.518 --> 22:01.020
But you're my baby girl.
- Mm-hmm.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.655
- Always will be.

22:02.689 --> 22:05.525
And you're better looking
than I am.

22:05.558 --> 22:08.828
- Well, that--
that's an obvious thing.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.563
- [laughing]

22:10.597 --> 22:11.931
- It's kind of like,
remember when we went

22:11.964 --> 22:14.567
to father-daughter sock hop,
and I wore a--

22:14.601 --> 22:17.036
what do they call those skirts?
Poodle skirt?

22:17.069 --> 22:18.805
It feels like that,
but different.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.773
[laughing]

22:20.807 --> 22:21.941
- Slightly.

22:21.974 --> 22:24.076
- I wanted to just feel, like,

22:24.110 --> 22:26.713
comfortable in our element,
and that's, you know,

22:26.746 --> 22:28.648
with the people that we've
invited and the place

22:28.681 --> 22:29.816
that we've chose, that's helped.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.818
- This is beautiful.

22:31.851 --> 22:32.952
- I didn't know that you and Mom

22:32.985 --> 22:35.555
hadn't seen each other
for four years.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.957
- [sighs]

22:37.990 --> 22:40.560
- I'm very happy that both
my mom and my dad

22:40.593 --> 22:42.495
could be here for
the wedding because

22:42.529 --> 22:44.697
they split up a few years ago,

22:44.731 --> 22:46.499
and we actually haven't
all been together

22:46.533 --> 22:48.768
as a family for probably
almost five years.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.537
- Well, it's tough
not seeing you guys,

22:50.570 --> 22:52.972
because, uh,
you're in California.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.974
- Dad, come visit me.
- I will.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.676
I'm sorry, baby.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.578
- I love both my mom
and my dad,

22:58.611 --> 22:59.746
and when they were together,
they were great,

22:59.779 --> 23:00.947
but at some point,

23:00.980 --> 23:04.050
they stopped being
partners in life,

23:04.083 --> 23:06.986
and Tom and I have faced some of
those similar things,

23:07.019 --> 23:09.989
so I think it gives us
a reason

23:10.022 --> 23:11.724
to maybe do things differently.

23:11.758 --> 23:12.925
I'm happy you're here.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.026
- I love you.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.695
- I love you too.

23:15.728 --> 23:20.500
*

23:20.533 --> 23:22.869
- 1 1/2 glasses of wine,
and I'm probably not

23:22.902 --> 23:24.737
functioning as well
as I should.

23:24.771 --> 23:27.507
- I'm not functioning
very well either.

23:27.540 --> 23:29.876
Wait, what about the piÃ±ata?
We didn't hit the piÃ±ata yet.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.612
- I don't like that because
to me, that's animal abuse.

23:32.645 --> 23:33.713
- Oh, it's a little pony.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.014
I had a "Little Mermaid" party,

23:35.047 --> 23:37.850
and I had an Ariel piÃ±ata,

23:37.884 --> 23:39.552
and when it came time,
I couldn't do it.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.721
- Oh, cried your eyes out.
- I couldn't do it.

23:41.754 --> 23:42.955
So we kept her--
- Pandora would cry

23:42.989 --> 23:44.757
when stuffing fell out of...

23:44.791 --> 23:47.727
So, how are you and Shay?
- Amazing.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.795
- Are you?
- Yeah.

23:48.828 --> 23:49.962
- No drugs?
- No.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.631
- What about drinking?
- No.

23:51.664 --> 23:52.999
He hasn't drank
since December 3rd.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.000
- Really.

23:54.033 --> 23:57.036
- His music is, like, amazing.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.771
I mean, he's--
he's doing so well.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.840
He's just in such a good place.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.575
His head's clear.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.043
We have, like,
our, like, spark back.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.078
Like, that, like, giddy feeling,

24:06.112 --> 24:08.047
like, when we, like, kiss,
it's like,

24:08.080 --> 24:10.049
the first time again,
and I didn't know

24:10.082 --> 24:11.784
if we were gonna be able
to get that back

24:11.818 --> 24:13.620
after last year,
now it's just, like--

24:13.653 --> 24:15.655
I get, like, excited
when he comes home, and--

24:15.688 --> 24:16.856
- Really?

24:16.889 --> 24:17.890
Scheana's telling me that

24:17.924 --> 24:20.159
everything's going well
in paradise,

24:20.192 --> 24:22.061
and that's what
I've got to believe.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.964
I mean, their marriage, I hope,
is in a good place,

24:24.997 --> 24:26.165
but I--I don't know.

24:26.198 --> 24:29.101
I never see Shay.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.803
That's great.

24:30.837 --> 24:31.971
- Yeah.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.806
Sober looks good on him.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.142
- Sober would probably look good
on any of us, really.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.210
- [laughs]
- F--- that.

24:38.244 --> 24:40.947
*

24:40.980 --> 24:42.715
- Take the bat.

24:42.749 --> 24:43.716
- Okay.

24:43.750 --> 24:45.718
- Lala said she's on her way.

24:45.752 --> 24:47.153
all: Yeah!
- Hey, Bubba.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.821
Let me finish it.
- Oh!

24:48.855 --> 24:50.590
Don't let go of the bat!

24:50.623 --> 24:53.192
all: Yeah!

24:53.225 --> 24:55.828
- Cheers, guys.
both: Cheers.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.797
- For once,
we're all getting along,

24:57.830 --> 24:59.699
and I feel like
it's a good omen.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.601
A good sign of things to come.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.603
- This mother----er's
getting married tomorrow!

25:03.636 --> 25:04.904
[all cheering]

25:04.937 --> 25:06.706
He's getting married tomorrow!

25:06.739 --> 25:09.141
- Cheers, guys.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.977
- Come on, let's just go
and have a quick chat

25:11.010 --> 25:13.112
before I got to go home.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.147
Do you feel ready for tomorrow?
- Yes!

25:15.181 --> 25:16.749
- Yeah.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.751
- I want to, like, really
fine-tune

25:18.785 --> 25:20.853
and finish the vows, but yeah,
other than that, like--

25:20.887 --> 25:22.054
- Have you not done
the vows yet?

25:22.088 --> 25:26.058
- No, I have--no, but it's--
I have to, like, fine-tune them.

25:26.092 --> 25:27.794
- When are you gonna
finish them?

25:27.827 --> 25:29.128
- No, tonight.
- Tonight?

25:29.161 --> 25:30.229
- Mm-hmm.
- Hurry up.

25:30.262 --> 25:31.130
- I don't want to interrupt.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.099
I just had to some say hi.
- Sit down.

25:33.132 --> 25:35.101
- You were so emotional,
Schwartzy.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.869
- I'm being very sentimental
in my old age.

25:36.903 --> 25:39.872
- That's okay.
Old age? What are you?

25:39.906 --> 25:42.842
- I'm going on 34 now.
- Oh, God.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.677
- What are you, 39?

25:44.711 --> 25:47.647
- Yeah, I wish.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.215
You know, actually,
I don't wish, really.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.950
- No.
- I don't wish because

25:50.983 --> 25:54.687
I look at, you know, my life,
and what I've experienced,

25:54.721 --> 25:55.922
and think--
- Yeah.

25:55.955 --> 25:57.289
- I wouldn't change
a thing, really.

25:57.323 --> 25:59.258
Some of it's been tough,
as it will be for you.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.027
both: Yeah.
- You know, you're gonna have

26:01.060 --> 26:02.094
things that come at you.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.195
That's what life is.
- I know.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.931
- It's checkered with problems.

26:04.964 --> 26:08.801
- Talking to Lisa,
who's been married 34 years,

26:08.835 --> 26:11.904
I mean, she knows
what she's talking about.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.173
The advice that she has is
advice that we should take,

26:14.206 --> 26:16.175
and the words that she have
are words that we should

26:16.208 --> 26:18.911
listen to and live by,
and it's--

26:18.945 --> 26:20.279
they're not to be taken lightly.

26:20.312 --> 26:22.248
- Just, you know, hold tight.

26:22.281 --> 26:23.916
*

26:23.950 --> 26:25.718
- I'll be there for you.
- But there's many good things

26:25.752 --> 26:27.754
that will counteract
that, you know?

26:27.787 --> 26:29.255
- You should just keep--
- I'm so happy that you

26:29.288 --> 26:30.256
agreed to do it, by the way.

26:30.289 --> 26:31.691
I don't want to get over-sappy,

26:31.724 --> 26:32.759
but it means a lot.
It means a lot.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.227
- I love you both.
- We've built a new foundation--

26:35.261 --> 26:36.829
wait, that's part of my vows!

26:36.863 --> 26:38.698
There's no doubt in my mind

26:38.731 --> 26:40.733
that Katie is the one
I want to marry.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.301
I want to spend the rest
of my life with her.

26:42.334 --> 26:45.237
She makes me happy,
and she fulfills me.

26:45.271 --> 26:46.939
- Are you leaving?
- I got to get out.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.941
Let's say good-bye.
- [groans]

26:48.975 --> 26:51.210
- I know we have our issues
to work on.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.946
But those are minor issues and
we're gonna work through them.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.915
- I love you.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.884
- Love you. I'm gonna see you
in the morning.

26:57.917 --> 27:00.019
Are you leaving too, Mama?
- Love you.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.755
- Regardless of what's happened
over the last year and a half,

27:02.789 --> 27:05.324
I can feel it--
the love is there.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.827
I can't wait
to get married tomorrow.

27:07.860 --> 27:11.230
- Bye, you. Bye. Mwah!

27:11.263 --> 27:12.932
- You're always--
- Don't stay up too late.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.767
- Last night as a single lady.

27:14.801 --> 27:15.902
- Exactly.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.137
*

27:18.170 --> 27:19.238
Coming up...

27:19.271 --> 27:22.008
I haven't used an iron
since 1986.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.843
- This I have got to see.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.311
- Things are not going well
for me right now,

27:25.344 --> 27:28.014
so you can bugger off.

27:30.717 --> 27:33.452
[hip-hop music]

27:33.485 --> 27:38.691
*

27:38.725 --> 27:40.860
- Hi. Good morning.

27:40.893 --> 27:43.462
It smells so good.
Happy wedding day.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.231
- Yay!

27:45.264 --> 27:47.433
- It's weird when you've known
people for a really long time

27:47.466 --> 27:49.836
and you've thought about
them getting married,

27:49.869 --> 27:52.338
and then when
it's actually there,

27:52.371 --> 27:53.806
you can't describe
that feeling.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.375
I could not feel more proud.

27:56.408 --> 27:57.944
My brain's still
not working yet.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.312
I feel, like, really--
I feel like I'm high.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.714
You know, like, when you get,
like, in your head,

28:01.748 --> 28:03.850
until you're paranoid?
[laughter]

28:03.883 --> 28:05.351
- You guys use these before?

28:05.384 --> 28:06.318
- We just went deep-sea fishing.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.287
Actually, these are the ones
you just flip.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.256
- Schwartz already knows
how to handle a long rod.

28:10.289 --> 28:11.357
[laughter]

28:11.390 --> 28:14.293
- I'm ready to rock and roll.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.495
- So this is the last time
that Schwartz is ever

28:16.528 --> 28:19.465
gonna be a single man fishing.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.033
Tom said there's
trouser snakes here.

28:21.067 --> 28:23.369
Is that true?
- Yeah, there's trouser snakes.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.504
[Australian accent] Big ol' long
trouser snakes.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.973
- If it were me
getting married,

28:27.006 --> 28:28.340
I don't think I'd be fishing.

28:28.374 --> 28:29.909
I mean, I'd probably be playing,
you know,

28:29.942 --> 28:31.410
a nice game of golf.
Ah!

28:31.443 --> 28:32.945
Or Russian Roulette.

28:32.979 --> 28:36.048
Oh, f--- you, you f---ing rock.

28:36.082 --> 28:38.851
- How do you feel today?
You excited? Are you nervous?

28:38.885 --> 28:40.787
- I'm not ready with the vows.
That's the only thing.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.121
I still haven't--
- You don't have your vows done?

28:42.154 --> 28:43.956
- No, I--I'm gonna do 'em.
I'm gonna do 'em.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.391
- You're "I'm gonna do 'em."

28:45.424 --> 28:47.126
- [sighs]
- Oh, God.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.862
I can only imagine it's gonna be
a lot of hair tugging

28:49.896 --> 28:53.532
and a lot of, "Well, Bubby,
well, you know, Bubby,"

28:53.565 --> 28:55.835
It would be painful.

28:55.868 --> 28:58.004
He cannot wing the vows.

28:58.037 --> 28:59.138
- I have to write 'em down,
cause I can't

28:59.171 --> 29:00.306
read it from my phone.

29:00.339 --> 29:01.340
That would look horrible, right?

29:01.373 --> 29:02.408
- No, you need to write it
on a nice piece of paper

29:02.441 --> 29:04.543
with nice handwriting.
- Wait, nice handwriting?

29:04.576 --> 29:07.346
It's like chicken scratch.
- Dude.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.149
- What are you doing?

29:10.182 --> 29:11.450
- I'm ironing my dress.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.385
- This I have got to see.

29:13.419 --> 29:16.122
- I haven't used an iron
since 1986.

29:16.155 --> 29:18.424
- [laughs]
Let's have a look.

29:18.457 --> 29:19.959
- I used to do it.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.427
- I've got to get
a picture of this.

29:21.460 --> 29:24.463
- Can sort of see it
when I need to...

29:24.496 --> 29:26.565
Bloody hell.
- [laughing]

29:26.598 --> 29:28.801
- Shut up, will you--
- Will you do my suit afterward?

29:28.835 --> 29:30.870
- Everybody always says,
"How do you manage

29:30.903 --> 29:33.039
to achieve so much
and do so much?"

29:33.072 --> 29:35.074
I don't do things like this

29:35.107 --> 29:37.343
because luckily, I have somebody
to help me out.

29:37.376 --> 29:40.046
Look, I've got a beige bathrobe
on and I'm ironing, okay?

29:40.079 --> 29:41.848
Things are not going well
for me right now,

29:41.881 --> 29:43.916
so you can bugger off and get
out of my face.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.585
Will you go away?
Why--stop taking the piss.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.588
[upbeat music]

29:49.621 --> 29:53.926
*

29:53.960 --> 29:55.461
- Have you finished your speech?
- Yeah.

29:55.494 --> 29:57.063
I just went over it again
in my head.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.598
I'm not gonna, like, practice it
like an actual speech,

29:59.631 --> 30:01.067
'cause I'm better at improv.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.401
- That's how I feel
about my vows,

30:02.434 --> 30:03.602
but I don't think
it's a good idea.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.071
- I don't think that's
a good idea, Katie.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.372
Not for your vows.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.140
- You're, like, so calm.
I don't know how.

30:08.174 --> 30:09.508
I'd be, like,
freaking out, I think.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.943
- What is there
to freak out about?

30:10.977 --> 30:12.478
- I don't know.
That's just my personality.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.546
I freaked out just going
to the passport office.

30:14.580 --> 30:16.082
[laughter]

30:16.115 --> 30:17.850
You're just calm as can be.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.185
- From what I've been hearing
from everyone else

30:19.218 --> 30:21.921
is that your wedding day
will just fly by,

30:21.954 --> 30:24.123
so I have worked very hard
to make sure

30:24.156 --> 30:27.026
everything was taken care of
before my wedding day,

30:27.059 --> 30:29.161
so that way, I can just relax,

30:29.195 --> 30:31.931
and have fun, and enjoy
every second of it.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.099
- Katie.
- Yeah?

30:33.132 --> 30:34.200
- So we're good on timing?

30:34.233 --> 30:35.467
You have pictures at 4:00?

30:35.501 --> 30:36.468
- Yeah.
- Okay.

30:36.502 --> 30:37.736
Do you want--need a drink?
Do you want food?

30:37.769 --> 30:40.973
I plan on helping Katie with
whatever she needs.

30:41.007 --> 30:43.109
And whatever she doesn't
know that she needs.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.878
You need me to find something?
Is your phone charged?

30:45.912 --> 30:48.547
Whether that means last-minute
organization for the wedding...

30:48.580 --> 30:50.549
Your mom is coming in a minute.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.885
Whether that means
"We need more alcohol,

30:52.919 --> 30:54.553
and someone has to drive
to go get it."

30:54.586 --> 30:56.889
- Five more handles of Tito's.

30:56.923 --> 30:58.190
- Five more.
- Five more.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.992
- We have to finish
making your bouquet.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.560
- Trisha has it.
- I'll go find her.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.662
That's why I call myself
the maid of honor.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.097
You need anything else?

31:05.131 --> 31:06.132
- I do need to finish my vows.

31:06.165 --> 31:07.466
[laughs] Oops.

31:07.499 --> 31:08.467
*

31:08.500 --> 31:09.969
- You guys all showered up?

31:10.002 --> 31:11.603
You're gonna look at me and say,
swear to God,

31:11.637 --> 31:13.172
you guys all took showers,
right?

31:13.205 --> 31:14.673
- Yeah.
- Okay.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.542
- Dude, Jax is making
your brothers f---ing say

31:16.575 --> 31:18.577
swear to God
they took a shower.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.446
Such a f---ing asshole.

31:20.479 --> 31:21.914
- Where's your suit?
- They're all upstairs, Jax.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.182
Sandoval has 'em.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.084
- Schwartz has a lot going on
right now with his wedding day,

31:25.117 --> 31:26.385
so, I mean, the least
of his problems

31:26.418 --> 31:29.021
is getting his brothers ready.
First of all, what--

31:29.055 --> 31:30.957
why do I have to dress
a 30-year-old man?

31:30.990 --> 31:32.591
Three of 'em.
Are those clean socks,

31:32.624 --> 31:33.659
or ones from yesterday?
Be honest.

31:33.692 --> 31:36.562
- These are from yesterday.
- Yeah. Clean socks.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.197
All you guys, give me your ties.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.699
We're gonna re-knot 'em.
Those knots are creased.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.501
- Bert, he doesn't have
the tie with him?

31:42.534 --> 31:44.570
- I didn't get mine.
- We're missing one.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.138
- I have to go get it.
- You got to go get it.

31:46.172 --> 31:47.306
- So I have to walk all the way
to go get it?

31:47.339 --> 31:49.976
- You sure do.
I just want to make sure,

31:50.009 --> 31:51.143
you know, Tommy's happy.

31:51.177 --> 31:52.578
- [chuckles]

31:52.611 --> 31:54.213
- It's beautiful.
- Hey, Mama.

31:54.246 --> 31:57.049
- Oh!
- Aw.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.117
- I have a little
something for you.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.151
I want to give it to you
real quick.

31:59.185 --> 32:01.553
- Okay. Thank you.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.323
- It's got, like,
a little, like, ring box,

32:04.356 --> 32:08.227
that says,
"Listen to the messages

32:08.260 --> 32:10.196
your heart is sending."

32:10.229 --> 32:12.264
- I've always told Katie that
since she was a little girl.

32:12.298 --> 32:15.201
When she'd, you know,
have troubles and stuff,

32:15.234 --> 32:16.568
just listen to your heart.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.504
Always listen to what
your heart tells you.

32:18.537 --> 32:19.638
- Cannot do this right now!

32:19.671 --> 32:24.510
Like, what? Like, I can't--
I'm not, like, not yet.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.178
- Hey, it's becoming
near the witching hour, man.

32:26.212 --> 32:27.746
If you're gonna back out,
do it now.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.615
- How's that? Like that?
- Love it, dude.

32:29.648 --> 32:30.682
- Why do you got your dress
pants on already?

32:30.716 --> 32:32.351
- Dude, I'm getting ready.
- Where's your shower?

32:32.384 --> 32:34.320
- I just need
to rinse my face off.

32:34.353 --> 32:36.989
Today's my day, you know, and
I want to be looking sharp.

32:37.023 --> 32:38.357
I want everything to be perfect.

32:38.390 --> 32:41.227
I don't need a shower.
Just throw on some deodorant.

32:41.260 --> 32:44.530
The old Irish shower.

32:44.563 --> 32:47.366
Ah!

32:47.399 --> 32:49.635
Wait, is that offensive?

32:49.668 --> 32:51.637
- Dude, these ties are actually
kind of hard to tie.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.239
'Cause these are so stiff!

32:53.272 --> 32:57.143
- Just like my boner.

32:57.176 --> 32:59.645
Tom's kind of like the--
the male makeover MacGyver.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.780
He didn't just bring his suit,
he brought...

33:01.813 --> 33:03.382
- Sandoval, you have
an extra tie, right?

33:03.415 --> 33:05.284
- Backup ties...
- I have like three ties.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.552
You can...
both: Borrow.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.120
- I have no idea
where my cuff links are.

33:08.154 --> 33:09.788
- I have extras.
- Backup cuff links...

33:09.821 --> 33:11.623
- Well, dude, do you know,
I have a dress shirt

33:11.657 --> 33:13.259
that has French cuffs
that's really nice.

33:13.292 --> 33:14.626
- Yeah.
- Backup shirts...

33:14.660 --> 33:16.262
- I have a level 32 hair spray.

33:16.295 --> 33:17.663
It's the strongest
on the market.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.365
- [laughs]
- He always has something

33:19.398 --> 33:21.233
that can just make your outfit
that much better.

33:21.267 --> 33:22.701
- Are these too raggedy?

33:22.734 --> 33:24.370
- Dude, no. I got socks.

33:24.403 --> 33:26.638
- [sighs] Dude, what would
I f---ing do without you?

33:26.672 --> 33:28.374
I need--I'm gonna need
20 minutes

33:28.407 --> 33:30.276
to go write down my vows.
- Schwartz!

33:30.309 --> 33:31.643
- I feel like we don't
have enough time.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.646
- Go chill, dude--
- Write your f---ing vows.

33:34.680 --> 33:35.814
- Clear your head, man.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.249
You believe this is
finally happening?

33:37.283 --> 33:38.684
- I know.
- It's finally here.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.819
Two weeks ago,
wasn't looking good.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.721
[laughs]
- Really wasn't.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.723
- What'd she do to you?
- She sat me down and said,

33:44.756 --> 33:46.158
"I bet you f---ed
that girl in Vegas."

33:46.192 --> 33:47.626
- Yeah, well, you did, so...

33:47.659 --> 33:49.828
- Yeah, and you're also a bitch.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.630
- Was not.
- I mean, if you're still

33:51.663 --> 33:53.632
together after all that,
then you should probably

33:53.665 --> 33:55.601
be together for the rest
of your life.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.136
- You're right.
- You know what I'm saying?

33:57.169 --> 33:58.804
- They're stuck together.

33:58.837 --> 34:00.172
- Coming up...

34:00.206 --> 34:02.641
- Everybody ready?

34:02.674 --> 34:03.642
- Guys...

34:03.675 --> 34:06.678
[all screaming]

34:11.317 --> 34:14.086
[hip-hop music]

34:14.120 --> 34:17.756
*

34:17.789 --> 34:19.758
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.393
- Hello.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.629
This is charming.
I see Katie's vision.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.697
It's kind of woodsy,
it's rustic.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.699
I think the next time
I get married,

34:27.733 --> 34:29.468
I'm gonna do it
somewhere like this.

34:29.501 --> 34:32.438
It's still elegant, but it's
a little kind of Bohemian.

34:32.471 --> 34:33.872
Look how sweet.

34:33.905 --> 34:37.376
It truly is lovely.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.777
Dearly beloved,

34:38.810 --> 34:40.879
we are gathered here today...

34:40.912 --> 34:42.013
Oh, no "Dearly beloved."

34:42.047 --> 34:44.483
I'm actually kind of feeling
more nervous

34:44.516 --> 34:46.518
because it's
somebody else's day,

34:46.552 --> 34:48.520
and if I screw it up,
I screw it up for them,

34:48.554 --> 34:50.822
and I don't want that to be
a remote possibility.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.524
I have to get it right.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.793
Do you think we could
cover this in fabric?

34:54.826 --> 34:56.895
Or do you have any extra fabric?
- Yeah, is that okay? To cover?

34:56.928 --> 34:58.297
The front of it?
- I think so.

34:58.330 --> 34:59.331
Why don't you do that.

34:59.365 --> 35:00.499
- This is not your restaurant.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.668
- So funny, because with Katie,

35:02.701 --> 35:04.670
said "What color are your
bridesmaid

35:04.703 --> 35:05.871
dresses gonna be?"
And she says,

35:05.904 --> 35:07.673
"I thought I'd have them
in dual tones,"

35:07.706 --> 35:10.376
so I said,
"What about, like, silver?"

35:10.409 --> 35:12.478
"Good idea," she said.
"What about white flowers?"

35:12.511 --> 35:14.680
"Good idea."
She just is so easygoing,

35:14.713 --> 35:17.616
she's just, "Yeah, that's
lovely, I love that."

35:17.649 --> 35:19.518
Can you imagine me?
I would be like,

35:19.551 --> 35:20.852
pain in everybody's ass.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.822
Oh, right, is that going there?

35:23.855 --> 35:26.158
- I think some white fabric
at the front

35:26.192 --> 35:27.726
will make it look much prettier.

35:27.759 --> 35:34.800
*

35:36.902 --> 35:38.504
- Ooh. F---.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.739
Oh, sh--, a f---ing bee?

35:40.772 --> 35:44.343
[grunts] That thing's gonna
drive me crazy.

35:44.376 --> 35:47.379
I f---ing got to write sh--!

35:47.413 --> 35:48.714
I know it's coming
down to the wire.

35:48.747 --> 35:50.516
I haven't written my vows.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.851
Just picked the wrong time
in the wrong room, dude.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.753
But I'm a master procrastinator.

35:54.786 --> 35:57.423
Sh--, now my pen.

35:57.456 --> 35:57.556
I got this.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.861
Alright, Whoo.

36:02.894 --> 36:06.198
*

36:06.232 --> 36:07.433
- She just wrapped it in lace.

36:07.466 --> 36:08.534
We can kind of
secure it a little,

36:08.567 --> 36:09.735
or if you want us to add
anything to it--

36:09.768 --> 36:10.602
- It's so good.
- Let's see.

36:10.636 --> 36:12.471
So it's, like,
wood from the grounds.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.606
Like, the groundskeeper
cut wood.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.542
- No way!
- Yeah.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.710
- This is gorgeous.
It's so original.

36:18.744 --> 36:20.479
- She has your tossing bouquet.
- I made it.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.682
- You did make it.
- Today is...

36:23.715 --> 36:26.652
without a doubt, the most
happiest day of my life.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.420
Everything is perfect.

36:28.454 --> 36:29.621
Ah!

36:29.655 --> 36:30.856
Almost.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.591
Ow!

36:32.624 --> 36:34.993
- Deal with it!
- Ow!

36:35.026 --> 36:37.529
I feel just a sharp pinch,

36:37.563 --> 36:40.899
like something jabbing
into my side.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.734
- Let's try this right now.

36:42.768 --> 36:44.436
Do you have to do it
on both sides?

36:44.470 --> 36:45.837
both: Yeah.
- They told me

36:45.871 --> 36:48.240
at the last fitting they were
gonna put boning in,

36:48.274 --> 36:49.841
but this is painful.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.543
- It's okay, weddings
are always late.

36:51.577 --> 36:52.811
- Yeah, totally normal.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.846
- You want to sit?
- Yeah. Okay.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.882
Maybe tacos and margaritas

36:56.915 --> 36:58.917
the night before you're
supposed to slip into

36:58.950 --> 37:01.853
a form-fitting wedding dress
is not the best idea.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.423
- So this is the part
that can't be broken.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.024
- Okay.
- If that seam f---s up,

37:06.057 --> 37:07.659
then we're f---ed,
'cause then the--

37:07.693 --> 37:09.795
the dress rips apart.

37:09.828 --> 37:11.463
- Look at your hair.
It looks great.

37:11.497 --> 37:13.899
- See the back?
- Whoa!

37:13.932 --> 37:16.001
- I need to fix--
the curls are falling,

37:16.034 --> 37:17.803
and it makes my head
look bald.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.806
You know, I've been a bridesmaid
a lot of times,

37:20.839 --> 37:24.042
and I'm in a dress,
I'm kind of uncomfortable.

37:24.075 --> 37:27.813
But like, having a suit, that
means I'm wearing pants.

37:27.846 --> 37:30.516
I can eat whatever
the hell I want.

37:30.549 --> 37:32.884
- Dude, this shirt
is so nice, man.

37:32.918 --> 37:33.985
- I know, it's f---ed.
- Do you know why

37:34.019 --> 37:35.621
it's so--don't do that.

37:35.654 --> 37:37.556
You know, Schwartz is
my best friend.

37:37.589 --> 37:40.692
I love him like a brother,

37:40.726 --> 37:43.295
and being here today,
being a part of

37:43.329 --> 37:45.297
this beautiful
wedding...[sighs].

37:45.331 --> 37:48.300
There's so much--there's so much
love in the air.

37:48.334 --> 37:50.469
- You look amazing.
- Dude. Guys. Thanks for--

37:50.502 --> 37:51.770
- Good luck out there.
- Seriously--

37:51.803 --> 37:53.472
- Thanks for your help
with my brothers.

37:53.505 --> 37:54.773
- You look the best.
- You saved my ass.

37:54.806 --> 37:55.907
- You look--
- It's a big day.

37:55.941 --> 37:56.942
You ready?
- I feel sexy. Really?

37:56.975 --> 38:00.512
- This is it.
Last stop, Tom.

38:00.546 --> 38:02.648
One vagina for the rest
of your life.

38:02.681 --> 38:03.982
But all joking aside,

38:04.015 --> 38:06.885
to finally be at this moment,
I'm just really excited.

38:06.918 --> 38:09.555
I'm really glad everything
came together,

38:09.588 --> 38:10.622
and they're getting married.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.724
- Did you bring a funnel?
I'll funnel a beer later.

38:12.758 --> 38:13.692
- All right, by the way,
you do--

38:13.725 --> 38:15.327
you do look the best
I've ever seen you, man.

38:15.361 --> 38:16.762
- Thank you, man.
I appreciate that.

38:16.795 --> 38:17.663
- You want a shot or something?
You okay?

38:17.696 --> 38:19.665
- No, I'm good on booze.
All right, dudes.

38:19.698 --> 38:20.866
Love you guys.
- Love you too, man.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.601
- Love you boys. See you guys.
- See you in a little bit.

38:22.634 --> 38:23.735
- All right.
- We'll cry a lot.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.003
- Amazing.
- We'll see you.

38:25.036 --> 38:27.005
- See you guys.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.674
I don't need to have
the rings yet, do I?

38:28.707 --> 38:31.877
Who should I ask about that?

38:31.910 --> 38:34.112
[dramatic music]

38:34.145 --> 38:35.747
- Oh, yeah.
- [laughs]

38:35.781 --> 38:38.350
- Stassi, you're like--
I feel like it's a moment.

38:38.384 --> 38:40.786
*

38:40.819 --> 38:42.120
- Do it?
- Yeah.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.889
- Everybody ready?

38:43.922 --> 38:47.526
*

38:47.559 --> 38:48.827
- You guys?
- [gasping]

38:48.860 --> 38:51.697
[all screaming]

38:51.730 --> 38:54.866
- Yay!
You looks gorgeous!

38:54.900 --> 38:58.103
- Goddess!
- How does it feel?

38:58.136 --> 39:00.639
- Katie looks so beautiful
in her dress.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.073
It brings back memories for me.

39:02.107 --> 39:05.644
I'm so excited to have her be
a part of the wives' club

39:05.677 --> 39:07.078
because as of right now,
in our group,

39:07.112 --> 39:09.881
there's only one member,
and that's me.

39:09.915 --> 39:11.783
- Okay, who's gonna catch
the bouquet tonight?

39:11.817 --> 39:13.552
Not that one.
- Stassi!

39:13.585 --> 39:15.921
- All your dreams are coming
true today, Katie.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.789
*

39:17.823 --> 39:20.091
- I love you so much.
- I love you too, Mom.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.660
- Coming up...

39:21.693 --> 39:23.762
- All right, Katie.
I'm lining everyone up.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.631
Hey, Tom, we're ready.
- Oh, my God.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.766
- Let's do this.
- Oh, my gosh.

39:27.799 --> 39:30.035
- Here we go.
- Daddy.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.408
- You guys have 15 minutes.

39:36.442 --> 39:37.809
- 15 minutes till ceremony?

39:37.843 --> 39:41.112
- * I'm gonna fall apart

39:41.146 --> 39:45.451
* I can't remember
anything before *

39:45.484 --> 39:49.087
* I'm shooting in the dark

39:49.120 --> 39:52.558
* I'm crashing through another
stained glass door *

39:52.591 --> 39:53.759
* Everywhere I step
I'm always *

39:53.792 --> 39:55.727
- You okay? How are you feeling?
- Good.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.128
- Yeah.
- I've been great.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.764
- Very relaxed.
- Yeah.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.466
- * And when it rains,
it pours *

40:00.499 --> 40:02.634
* And drowns my dreams

40:02.668 --> 40:04.570
* So just sit back and watch

40:04.603 --> 40:06.705
- Dad, what's up?
Hey, oh, my God.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.607
I'm in the wedding-day
whirlwind.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.542
It's like, the only thing
that's missing is you.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.744
Ah, f---, my head--I can't even
think straight, Dad.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.746
Anyways, the important thing is
I love you so much,

40:14.780 --> 40:16.748
and I miss the sh-- out of you,
and I can't wait to come home.

40:16.782 --> 40:19.084
Okay. All right. Bye, Dad.
All right, I love you.

40:19.117 --> 40:22.788
- * Even though my feet

40:22.821 --> 40:24.690
- Why don't you shake
your dress out, sweetie?

40:24.723 --> 40:25.757
- Oh, yeah.
- Walking through

40:25.791 --> 40:27.225
the dirt trails, yeah.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.894
- Okay, Tom, we're ready.
- Oh, my God.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.162
- Let's do this.
- I got some pep in my step.

40:31.196 --> 40:32.698
- Dirt went inside
my dress a little bit.

40:32.731 --> 40:34.700
- How'd it get inside there?
- You won't even notice

40:34.733 --> 40:36.468
when you're walking.
- Kristin.

40:36.502 --> 40:38.169
- Yes?
- You're remarkably helpful.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.071
- Have you got any in your
drawers, darling?

40:40.105 --> 40:42.574
- No, thank God.

40:42.608 --> 40:43.842
- Man.
- Right here?

40:43.875 --> 40:45.844
- Got to give us
full VIP status?

40:45.877 --> 40:48.213
- All right, Katie.
I'm lining everyone up.

40:48.246 --> 40:49.214
- There are no words.

40:49.247 --> 40:51.817
Being in the woods,
in my dress,

40:51.850 --> 40:54.119
with all of our friends
and family,

40:54.152 --> 40:55.654
about to walk down the aisle
and marry Tom.

40:55.687 --> 40:58.189
There are no words.

40:58.223 --> 41:02.928
- * Even though my feet

41:02.961 --> 41:04.730
- I know how
to pull off a suit.

41:04.763 --> 41:07.098
But damn, Ariana looks good.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.535
- * Without an end in sight

41:09.568 --> 41:11.503
- I think she might have
wore it better.

41:11.537 --> 41:13.204
- * It'll be all right

41:13.238 --> 41:15.206
* It'll be all right

41:15.240 --> 41:18.143
- Oh.
- Oh, my gosh.

41:18.176 --> 41:20.846
- Here we go.
- Daddy.

41:20.879 --> 41:23.214
- * It'll be all right

41:23.248 --> 41:26.217
*

41:26.251 --> 41:27.653
- Speechless.

41:27.686 --> 41:29.220
*

41:29.254 --> 41:31.523
- * It'll be all

41:31.557 --> 41:32.958
*

41:32.991 --> 41:34.560
- Schwartz.

41:34.593 --> 41:35.661
- You're gonna make me cry.

41:35.694 --> 41:37.829
- Oh, let's try
not cry just yet.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.298
*

41:40.331 --> 41:42.601
- You look good.
- You look good too, man.

41:42.634 --> 41:48.607
*

41:48.640 --> 41:50.308
- Oh, puppies.

41:50.341 --> 41:51.743
Please stand.

41:51.777 --> 41:58.249
*

41:58.283 --> 42:00.619
- I just want to slow it down
and pause it,

42:00.652 --> 42:04.322
and just savor the moment,
'cause it's absolutely perfect.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.857
*

42:05.891 --> 42:08.994
- * It'll be all right

42:09.027 --> 42:10.929
- Next time,
on the season finale

42:10.962 --> 42:12.263
of "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:12.297 --> 42:14.733
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

42:14.766 --> 42:17.936
[all cheering]

42:17.969 --> 42:20.338
[upbeat music]

42:20.371 --> 42:22.240
- When do you think
you'll have a baby?

42:22.273 --> 42:23.609
- Oh, my God.

42:23.642 --> 42:25.877
[all screaming]

42:25.911 --> 42:27.746
- We've taken on
another premises.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.915
A bar always needs a face.

42:29.948 --> 42:31.750
- What?

42:31.783 --> 42:33.218
- Want to get married
at some point?

42:33.251 --> 42:35.020
- Oh, my God.

42:35.053 --> 42:37.756
- There's a lot of things that
I found out recently

42:37.789 --> 42:38.790
about Shay.

42:38.824 --> 42:41.627
- Listen, you're young enough
to start again.

42:41.660 --> 42:44.029
- The way you treat me,
how a lot of people treat me--

42:44.062 --> 42:46.297
- By taking care of you?
- How, financially?

42:46.331 --> 42:47.298
'Cause that's about it.

42:47.332 --> 42:50.268
- So you're not on drugs?

42:50.301 --> 42:54.640
Divorces aren't easy,
but it has to be that way.

42:54.673 --> 42:55.907
