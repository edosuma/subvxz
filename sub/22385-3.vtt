WEBVTT

00:01.073 --> 00:02.807
Cheers.

00:02.809 --> 00:04.743
Cheers.

00:06.712 --> 00:08.880
Well, shall we check out the view?

00:09.598 --> 00:11.145
I already am.

00:11.192 --> 00:14.106
What? I have an extremely hot wife.

00:14.168 --> 00:15.622
- You can't blame me.
- So you're saying

00:15.646 --> 00:17.679
I should ditch the boots
for heels more often?

00:17.704 --> 00:20.972
No. I'm saying you should probably ditch

00:20.997 --> 00:24.532
that whole outfit and
just keep the cuffs.

00:24.812 --> 00:26.837
<i>Guys, please stop.</i>

00:26.882 --> 00:28.626
You realize we can hear
everything you're saying.

00:28.650 --> 00:29.969
Everything.

00:30.037 --> 00:31.109
<i>Sorry.</i>

00:31.147 --> 00:32.607
<i>You guys still got eyes on Loewe?</i>

00:32.631 --> 00:35.900
Yes, I do. It's him and his daughter.

00:36.109 --> 00:38.908
It could be his wife. It's hard to tell.

00:38.933 --> 00:40.236
<i>How are you guys making out down there?</i>

00:40.260 --> 00:42.227
Breaking through the firewall now.

00:44.329 --> 00:46.497
Okay, so get this. My
little cousin asked me

00:46.499 --> 00:47.732
for Patterson's autograph yesterday.

00:47.734 --> 00:49.500
I told you. That app she
made is a big deal.

00:49.502 --> 00:51.235
Whatever. Who has time
for stuff like that?

00:51.237 --> 00:54.172
Apparently 75 million people.

00:54.798 --> 00:56.273
Wait. Seriously?

00:56.275 --> 01:00.046
75 million people at 3 bucks a pop?

01:00.093 --> 01:03.505
- That's like...
- We're in.

01:04.059 --> 01:05.885
Suspect's on the move.

01:05.910 --> 01:07.842
We don't have the files yet.

01:12.771 --> 01:15.911
Excuse me, Mr. Loewe,
I just want to say,

01:15.936 --> 01:18.117
the work that you're doing
for the children of Sumatra

01:18.142 --> 01:19.142
is remarkable.

01:19.404 --> 01:20.803
Well, it's just so important

01:20.828 --> 01:22.528
to give back for the future.

01:27.206 --> 01:29.881
Look. Everything we need.

01:29.942 --> 01:32.209
We got it. Read him his rights!

01:32.245 --> 01:35.179
Kevin Loewe, FBI.

01:35.181 --> 01:36.525
What the hell is this?

01:36.550 --> 01:38.605
You're under arrest
for securities fraud,

01:38.630 --> 01:40.530
three counts of manslaughter,

01:40.555 --> 01:42.763
and conspiracy to commit
an act of terrorism.

01:42.788 --> 01:46.423
Turn around. Come with me.

01:50.940 --> 01:52.363
Hey, great work.

01:52.477 --> 01:55.745
The evidence off Loewe's
computers is a gold mine.

01:55.947 --> 01:57.780
Nice.

01:58.976 --> 02:00.643
How you holding up?

02:01.165 --> 02:05.142
You want to know the truth? Not great.

02:05.914 --> 02:07.511
Say what you will about Silicon Valley,

02:07.513 --> 02:09.913
but at least my co-workers
didn't end up dead.

02:10.208 --> 02:11.382
Look, everyone will understand

02:11.384 --> 02:13.050
if you want to take some time off.

02:13.192 --> 02:15.219
I'm fine. I just got back.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.459
How'd we do?

02:16.521 --> 02:17.999
A lot of great stuff

02:18.024 --> 02:19.790
coming off of Loewe's computers.

02:19.838 --> 02:21.565
All right, good. Here's
how I wanna play it.

02:21.598 --> 02:23.861
Thanks for the heads
up about the arrest.

02:24.070 --> 02:26.831
Kevin Loewe is one of the
biggest names on Wall Street.

02:27.190 --> 02:30.084
This bust has a lot of people
in Washington very nervous.

02:30.131 --> 02:31.140
The intel is solid.

02:31.170 --> 02:33.070
Here. Allow me.

02:33.072 --> 02:34.572
So, Jane's back is covered

02:34.574 --> 02:36.929
in microscopic specks
of luminescent ink.

02:36.954 --> 02:38.320
I realized if you put

02:38.345 --> 02:41.043
a two-by-two centimeter
grid on her back,

02:41.068 --> 02:44.248
each speck sits perfectly in
the intersecting corners.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.908
So, I took the specks, basically
squished them together.

02:46.933 --> 02:48.814
Turns out they're
alphanumeric fragments.

02:48.839 --> 02:50.740
And you'll recognize the
formatting of the sequence.

02:50.764 --> 02:53.832
It's how we code anonymous
tips from the FBI hotline.

02:54.006 --> 02:56.506
100B... domestic terrorism.

02:56.562 --> 02:58.362
The tip in question alleged
Loewe's responsible

02:58.364 --> 03:00.456
for train derailment four months
ago that killed three people.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.939
The case file was dismissed
for lack of evidence.

03:02.964 --> 03:04.707
But the fact that it was on Jane's body

03:04.732 --> 03:05.987
made us look at it again.

03:06.012 --> 03:08.190
Why would a billionaire
want to crash a train?

03:08.233 --> 03:10.079
We didn't know either,
until we discovered

03:10.104 --> 03:11.809
Loewe shorted KeyRail's stock

03:11.890 --> 03:14.712
and made a one-day gain of $350 million.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.153
Well, what did you find on his servers?

03:18.210 --> 03:19.676
E-mails proving he paid an engineer

03:19.752 --> 03:21.383
to tamper with the brakes.

03:21.616 --> 03:23.931
- Is he talking?
- No, he's not.

03:23.997 --> 03:25.189
His lawyer is inbound.

03:25.243 --> 03:27.337
This evidence better be ironclad

03:27.393 --> 03:30.628
or we're about to have a
PR nightmare on our hands.

03:38.842 --> 03:39.984
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:40.009 --> 03:41.029
How's it going? I know...

03:41.054 --> 03:42.521
I know you told me not to, but...

03:43.315 --> 03:44.676
I've been looking into Stuart's murder.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.533
Patterson, we have an
entire team on that.

03:46.558 --> 03:48.567
I know, I know, but Stuart
couldn't stop yapping

03:48.592 --> 03:52.228
about this Kinga home voice
command system that he bought.

03:52.359 --> 03:54.395
Said he would never have
to lift a finger again.

03:54.420 --> 03:55.646
"Hey, Kinga, buy me toilet paper."

03:55.670 --> 03:57.136
"Kinga, find me books
on the singularity."

03:57.160 --> 03:58.814
What does that have to
do with Stuart's murder?

03:58.838 --> 04:01.572
There's no mention of the
device in the evidence log.

04:01.887 --> 04:03.567
You think it recorded the murder?

04:03.720 --> 04:05.830
Yeah, but it's not that easy.

04:06.155 --> 04:08.627
The company claims Kinga
doesn't "actively" record

04:08.668 --> 04:11.268
conversations other than
the voice commands.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.675
But you think they do.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.506
Well, I have a friend who
worked on the coding,

04:15.508 --> 04:17.173
and she all but confirmed it.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.009
Can this friend do us another favor?

04:19.067 --> 04:20.673
She doesn't have access anymore.

04:20.740 --> 04:22.046
She cashed out her stock options

04:22.048 --> 04:24.249
and retired last month. She was 32.

04:24.274 --> 04:25.574
Okay, how are we supposed
to get a warrant

04:25.598 --> 04:26.940
for something that doesn't exist?

04:26.965 --> 04:28.197
I don't know,

04:28.309 --> 04:29.391
but the way these servers work,

04:29.415 --> 04:31.496
the data is scrubbed after 72 hours.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.683
That doesn't give us much time.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.859
Well, I think they're
gonna need a nudge,

04:35.500 --> 04:37.510
and by nudge, I mean a
hammer on the head,

04:37.535 --> 04:40.469
like a house call from the
Assistant Director of the FBI.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.505
Hi.

04:51.074 --> 04:53.544
There's a mace in the woodshed.

04:53.677 --> 04:56.413
You need it to beat the
manticore in the castle mist.

04:56.507 --> 04:58.349
I'm sorry? Wizardville, right?

04:58.607 --> 05:00.417
Don't be embarrassed.
It's a quality app.

05:00.486 --> 05:02.652
Special Agent Weller. This is Jane.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.969
Courtney Puritsky. I'm Mr.
Loewe's attorney.

05:05.015 --> 05:06.557
My client is innocent of all charges

05:06.559 --> 05:08.097
and needs to be released immediately.

05:08.122 --> 05:11.245
We've seized dozens of e-mails
linking your innocent client

05:11.270 --> 05:12.732
to the train derailment that happened

05:12.756 --> 05:14.119
in Pennsylvania four months ago.

05:14.144 --> 05:16.066
No, you seized planted e-mails.

05:16.068 --> 05:17.240
What do you mean, "planted"?

05:17.265 --> 05:18.593
An anonymous group of hackers

05:18.618 --> 05:20.004
has been terrorizing Mr. Loewe

05:20.030 --> 05:21.311
for the past six months.

05:21.336 --> 05:23.146
I have banker's boxes full of evidence

05:23.171 --> 05:25.137
to prove it... firewall breaches,

05:25.177 --> 05:27.344
denial of service attacks,
e-mail forgeries.

05:27.389 --> 05:29.190
Why would they be targeting Mr. Loewe?

05:29.215 --> 05:31.326
When you have the kind of
wealth and influence he has,

05:31.350 --> 05:32.824
it attracts some negative attention.

05:32.849 --> 05:34.659
So, why didn't you call the authorities?

05:34.698 --> 05:36.797
Mr. Loewe can afford
better investigators

05:36.822 --> 05:39.587
and security specialists
than the FBI has access to.

05:39.874 --> 05:42.226
- No offense.
- Offense taken.

05:42.628 --> 05:44.974
So, what did these "specialists" say?

05:45.121 --> 05:47.402
They identified the hackers
as an anonymous collective

05:47.427 --> 05:49.860
known as "The Three Blind Mice."

05:50.682 --> 05:52.413
We're gonna need to see
those banker's boxes.

05:52.437 --> 05:54.623
Not a problem. And after that, I suggest

05:54.648 --> 05:56.045
you go after the Three Blind Mice

05:56.070 --> 05:57.484
and stop harassing my client

05:57.509 --> 06:00.276
unless you want a nine-figure
lawsuit on your hands.

06:06.352 --> 06:08.986
Oh, Patty Cakes in the house!

06:09.033 --> 06:12.152
What brings you down to my
little corner office, huh?

06:12.543 --> 06:15.477
Ooh! What is that?

06:15.502 --> 06:16.654
It's a scrambler.

06:16.679 --> 06:18.864
Did you hack into Kevin Loewe's server?

06:18.889 --> 06:20.234
What? No. Who?

06:20.259 --> 06:21.492
If you're lying to me, I swear...

06:21.516 --> 06:23.917
I am not lying. What
are you talking about?

06:25.496 --> 06:28.997
There is a tattoo case pointing
to the Three Blind Mice.

06:29.050 --> 06:32.028
Hirst wants all hands on
deck to track them down.

06:32.195 --> 06:33.897
And I assume you put the kibosh on that?

06:33.922 --> 06:36.856
What was I supposed to say?
"Hey, don't go after them.

06:36.968 --> 06:38.868
"Turns out, two of the Three Blind Mice

06:38.870 --> 06:40.003
"are actually me and Rich.

06:40.005 --> 06:41.371
"We did a bunch of illegal hacks

06:41.373 --> 06:42.900
that we should probably
go to prison for."

06:42.924 --> 06:44.318
Yeah, you might want to
work on your wording there.

06:44.342 --> 06:46.810
I'd probably deemphasize the
"illegal hacks" aspect,

06:46.812 --> 06:47.755
and the word "prison"

06:47.780 --> 06:48.825
should really not be part
of your messaging...

06:48.849 --> 06:50.082
It is only a matter of time

06:50.107 --> 06:51.992
before they come for us,
and when they do...

06:52.017 --> 06:53.794
I'm gonna lose my FBI consulting gig.

06:53.819 --> 06:56.520
They're gonna send me back to jail.

06:56.828 --> 07:00.358
I mean, it's not... It'd
be bad for both of us.

07:03.428 --> 07:05.462
It's Weller.

07:05.501 --> 07:06.954
He wants to see me.

07:08.620 --> 07:12.569
Oh, me too. Looks like time's up.

07:17.652 --> 07:22.652
synced & corrected by PopcornAWH
www.addic7ed.com

07:23.817 --> 07:25.483
I'll go first.

07:26.611 --> 07:28.868
You wanted to see us, mademoiselle?

07:28.893 --> 07:32.094
Yes, I did. Ever heard
of the Three Blind Mice?

07:32.267 --> 07:34.544
Yeah. I believe they ran
after the farmer's wife.

07:34.569 --> 07:36.315
I think their tails got
cut off at some point.

07:36.339 --> 07:38.706
No, not the nursery rhyme,
Rich, the hacker group.

07:38.731 --> 07:40.064
We think they've been targeting

07:40.098 --> 07:41.813
this Wall Street guy we've been after.

07:41.838 --> 07:43.332
Oh, those Three Blind Mice.

07:43.357 --> 07:44.356
So you know them?

07:44.381 --> 07:46.014
No, no. I mean, you know,

07:46.184 --> 07:47.855
I've been out of the game
for a year, you know,

07:47.879 --> 07:49.311
since I became a law-abiding,

07:49.313 --> 07:52.393
law-enforcing crime-stopping
citizen, right?

07:52.418 --> 07:53.949
It's not really my...

07:54.004 --> 07:55.504
Well, the techs confirmed it.

07:55.538 --> 07:57.432
Those emails were planted
on Loewe's servers.

07:57.457 --> 07:58.988
Okay, well, that doesn't
mean they were forged.

07:58.990 --> 08:00.189
He still could've written them.

08:00.191 --> 08:02.058
Real or fake, tampered evidence

08:02.083 --> 08:03.864
is still inadmissible in court.

08:03.889 --> 08:06.063
Sounds like you owe this
Loewe guy an apology.

08:06.088 --> 08:07.983
May I suggest an edible arrangement?

08:08.008 --> 08:09.574
Apologies won't cut it.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.610
According to DC, we
just publicly arrested

08:11.612 --> 08:13.632
and humiliated a powerful civilian

08:13.657 --> 08:14.956
under false pretenses.

08:15.182 --> 08:17.149
I want this hacker collective

08:17.151 --> 08:19.104
on a silver platter. Otherwise,

08:19.129 --> 08:21.196
Loewe is about to bury
us with his billions.

08:21.221 --> 08:23.988
You know, sometimes a simple
"I was wrong" can do wonders.

08:24.013 --> 08:25.346
Loewe's private investigators

08:25.371 --> 08:27.037
have done half the work already.

08:27.127 --> 08:29.260
I have some security cam photos

08:29.362 --> 08:32.587
of one of the suspects
stalking Loewe's residence.

08:32.652 --> 08:37.388
You have a picture of them?
Of the Three Blind Mice?

08:39.871 --> 08:42.174
They actually wear a mouse mask?

08:43.770 --> 08:46.711
That's a little on the nose.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.340
Find this person.

08:48.399 --> 08:50.307
- Do whatever it takes.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:50.332 --> 08:53.718
- We can keep this?
- No. Put it down.

08:54.146 --> 08:55.301
Okay.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.146
- We have to come clean.
- Come clean?

08:58.171 --> 08:59.533
- Yeah.
- Come clean to what?

08:59.558 --> 09:00.769
We had no part of this.

09:00.794 --> 09:02.306
We dropped out of Three
Blind Mice a year ago

09:02.330 --> 09:04.292
because somebody thought it
was getting too dangerous.

09:04.316 --> 09:06.849
Well, Electra obviously took the banner

09:06.874 --> 09:08.130
and kept going without us.

09:08.155 --> 09:09.345
We never should have helped her out.

09:09.369 --> 09:10.918
Electra was a visionary,

09:10.943 --> 09:13.069
white hat hacking using
black hat techniques,

09:13.094 --> 09:15.060
taking down all those
so-called "untouchables"

09:15.101 --> 09:16.749
on Wall Street, in the government,

09:16.781 --> 09:19.028
everybody that we know is guilty
but could never prove it.

09:19.052 --> 09:21.686
I know. I just got caught up
in the hacktivism of it all.

09:21.711 --> 09:22.918
- Yeah.
- Her code was so amazing.

09:22.942 --> 09:25.365
I felt like we were Robin
Hood's merry band of thieves.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.507
Yeah, but, look, we don't
have anything to do

09:27.532 --> 09:29.921
with this Loewe case. There's
nothing to worry about.

09:29.946 --> 09:31.713
Nothing to...?

09:31.876 --> 09:35.117
The FBI is targeting the hacker
group we were a part of.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.152
To do good.

09:36.177 --> 09:37.600
It doesn't matter what the reasons were.

09:37.624 --> 09:39.164
- It was illegal.
- Okay, you know what?

09:39.166 --> 09:40.265
Can we focus on the positives here?

09:40.267 --> 09:42.234
It's Three Blind Mice, right?

09:42.236 --> 09:43.750
Anonymous. She doesn't know who we are.

09:43.774 --> 09:44.838
We don't know who she is.

09:44.863 --> 09:46.481
There is a literal firewall

09:46.506 --> 09:47.872
between us and Electra.

09:47.918 --> 09:51.943
But if they go after
the Three Blind Mice,

09:52.015 --> 09:55.180
they will trace it back to us.

09:55.574 --> 09:57.782
Well, then, we'll make it
a little harder for them,

09:58.181 --> 09:59.648
if you catch my drift.

10:00.155 --> 10:01.988
By obstructing justice?

10:02.084 --> 10:03.617
Drift caught.

10:05.107 --> 10:07.909
You just got the team to trust you.

10:08.091 --> 10:10.224
Do you really want to
jeopardize that again?

10:11.134 --> 10:13.271
If it means avoiding multiple
felony charges, yes.

10:13.296 --> 10:15.811
Yes, I do. Absolutely. And so do you.

10:18.427 --> 10:21.295
I am so sorry, but that's just not true.

10:21.377 --> 10:23.879
I promise, Kinga does not
record private conversations.

10:23.940 --> 10:25.559
I can get you a copy of our
user agreement if you...

10:25.583 --> 10:27.317
I'm an Assistant Director of the FBI,

10:27.342 --> 10:29.035
and I know what's going on here.

10:29.079 --> 10:31.414
I need to speak to the
most senior executive

10:31.439 --> 10:34.031
in this building... now.

10:34.056 --> 10:39.159
Okay. I'll get our head
of Global Security.

10:42.249 --> 10:45.393
Your girlfriend's hilarious.

10:45.801 --> 10:47.441
Since when are you texting Meg?

10:47.466 --> 10:49.166
Since we had the best time ever

10:49.191 --> 10:50.982
at brunch and yoga last weekend.

10:51.056 --> 10:52.253
Don't take this the wrong way,

10:52.277 --> 10:53.614
but she's way out of your league.

10:53.639 --> 10:55.512
She's beautiful, smart, successful.

10:55.537 --> 10:56.997
No daddy issues.

10:57.022 --> 10:59.073
You'd better put a ring
on that before I do.

10:59.098 --> 11:00.797
It's the team.

11:01.811 --> 11:03.313
- <i>What you got?</i>
- Oh...

11:03.338 --> 11:06.373
Okay, so I was able to use
the mouse mask footage

11:06.420 --> 11:08.453
to study the suspect's body movements

11:08.455 --> 11:11.049
and I created a partial
biometric profile.

11:11.074 --> 11:12.240
Tell me you got a match.

11:12.265 --> 11:13.502
We matched the suspect

11:13.527 --> 11:15.635
to a person seen at an ATM

11:15.660 --> 11:17.739
a mile from Loewe's estate, and I used

11:17.764 --> 11:20.165
this new experimental gait
recognition technology

11:20.167 --> 11:21.852
the NSA has to confirm it.

11:22.352 --> 11:24.469
And once we got a face, it
was only a matter of time

11:24.471 --> 11:27.648
'til we got a name.
Meet Kathy Gustafson.

11:27.673 --> 11:30.475
35, single, lives in
a studio in Yonkers.

11:30.477 --> 11:32.854
Has over a dozen online
dating memberships

11:32.980 --> 11:36.146
and works as an IT
consultant for Nerd Herd.

11:36.319 --> 11:38.610
The most depressing criminal
profile I've ever seen.

11:38.635 --> 11:39.968
Any idea where she is now?

11:39.993 --> 11:41.563
Yeah. I tracked her phone.

11:41.588 --> 11:44.010
She's at Nerd Herd's midtown location.

11:44.035 --> 11:45.177
Nicely done.

11:45.202 --> 11:46.936
Thank you. Yeah, super, super proud

11:46.961 --> 11:48.121
of the work we're doing here.

11:48.168 --> 11:50.022
<i>All right. Send a team out, pick her up.</i>

11:50.047 --> 11:52.111
<i>- Weller, you run the interrogation.</i>
- Got it.

11:52.142 --> 11:54.141
Actually, I will handle the questioning.

11:54.541 --> 11:57.424
I'm getting a lot of heat from
Washington to make this right.

11:57.771 --> 12:00.039
I would love to have you two in with me.

12:00.064 --> 12:01.530
I could use your expertise.

12:01.555 --> 12:04.923
And we would love to provide it.

12:05.085 --> 12:06.808
<i>Keep us posted.</i>

12:10.216 --> 12:11.351
She's never seen our faces.

12:11.376 --> 12:12.642
She has no idea who we are.

12:12.667 --> 12:15.122
Oh, that's why I feel
so relaxed right now.

12:17.756 --> 12:20.811
Have I heard of the Three Blind Mice?

12:20.836 --> 12:24.163
Who hasn't? They're real famous,

12:24.188 --> 12:26.209
at least in the IT community.

12:26.433 --> 12:29.868
Are you aware of the kinds of
hacks they're responsible for?

12:30.010 --> 12:33.180
Disrupting government
services in Germany,

12:33.319 --> 12:35.920
shutting down the stock market in Seoul,

12:35.978 --> 12:38.312
not to mention stealing
millions of dollars.

12:38.471 --> 12:39.748
Billions, actually.

12:39.773 --> 12:42.507
Yeah, I know. What's
that got to do with me?

12:43.876 --> 12:45.143
Look familiar?

12:45.373 --> 12:46.891
We tracked your movements

12:46.916 --> 12:48.809
from an ATM to the Loewe estate.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.802
We also know you used a
computer at Nerd Herd in SoHo

12:51.865 --> 12:54.198
to hack Loewe's computer several times.

12:54.534 --> 12:57.191
You bounced the signal to make
it look like the IP address

12:57.216 --> 12:58.349
was coming from Antarctica,

12:58.374 --> 13:01.330
but we were able to trace it back.

13:01.367 --> 13:03.034
You're caught, Kathy.

13:03.059 --> 13:04.758
Help us, we can help you.

13:05.938 --> 13:08.873
No. I can help you.

13:09.244 --> 13:10.396
What?

13:10.421 --> 13:13.486
You're coming at this all wrong.

13:13.511 --> 13:16.612
We didn't disrupt government
services in Germany.

13:16.637 --> 13:18.671
We sent out a short that deleted

13:18.696 --> 13:21.400
the foreign minister's drive
containing military secrets

13:21.425 --> 13:22.857
he was selling to Russia.

13:22.961 --> 13:25.729
And as for the stock
market glitch in Seoul,

13:25.754 --> 13:27.821
we prevented a total market collapse

13:27.899 --> 13:29.888
that would've spread
through Southeast Asia.

13:29.913 --> 13:32.578
And we never stole money. Ever.

13:32.603 --> 13:36.038
We stole back ill-gotten
funds and returned them

13:36.063 --> 13:37.596
to the people who were screwed over

13:37.621 --> 13:38.987
by these corrupt companies

13:39.012 --> 13:40.284
and governments in the first place,

13:40.308 --> 13:41.889
and we never took a cent.

13:42.233 --> 13:44.975
So, you're like the Robin
Hoods of the dark web.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.265
Is that an accurate assessment?

13:46.290 --> 13:47.557
That doesn't sound so bad to me.

13:47.581 --> 13:48.814
Opposite, opposite.

13:48.839 --> 13:50.739
That is very bad and very illegal.

13:50.962 --> 13:52.628
Who are your partners?

13:53.883 --> 13:55.551
I don't know their names.

13:55.576 --> 13:57.233
You don't know who you
were working with?

13:57.257 --> 13:58.712
No, I didn't say that.

13:58.737 --> 14:00.555
I just never met them in person

14:00.580 --> 14:03.385
and we didn't exchange names
in case we ever got caught.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.335
When's the last time you communicated?

14:05.817 --> 14:07.950
About a year ago, before we disbanded,

14:08.125 --> 14:10.797
which was not my choice, but...

14:11.223 --> 14:13.136
I miss them so bad.

14:13.178 --> 14:15.679
We're still best friends, though.

14:15.914 --> 14:18.294
They're just layin' low for a bit.

14:18.359 --> 14:20.092
So, how did you do it? How did you hack

14:20.118 --> 14:22.018
into Kevin Loewe's personal computer?

14:22.086 --> 14:23.519
Let me guess.

14:23.544 --> 14:26.781
Your experts here can't figure it out.

14:26.912 --> 14:29.875
Hmm. You know, if I had
to venture a hypothesis,

14:29.900 --> 14:32.345
I'd say you manipulated
the blade pass frequency

14:32.370 --> 14:35.705
of the CPU fan, thereby remote accessing

14:35.707 --> 14:37.300
the main circuit board.

14:37.325 --> 14:39.719
Is that in the right ballpark, or...?

14:40.165 --> 14:42.438
That's actually pretty close.

14:42.508 --> 14:45.342
Oh, by "pretty close," do you
mean 100% correct, or...?

14:45.450 --> 14:50.325
So you admit to falsifying
e-mails on Kevin Loewe's server?

14:50.381 --> 14:53.769
No, I admit to putting back e-mails

14:53.794 --> 14:55.402
that Kevin Loewe deleted.

14:55.427 --> 14:58.434
He's the criminal here, not us.
You know what?

14:58.459 --> 15:00.392
The only reason I'm telling you all this

15:00.417 --> 15:03.485
and not lawyering-up is
people's lives are in danger.

15:03.684 --> 15:04.792
What do you mean?

15:04.817 --> 15:08.584
Loewe just shorted a boatload
of Volta Motors stock.

15:09.247 --> 15:11.250
The last time he did that with KeyRail,

15:11.275 --> 15:12.441
he caused an accident

15:12.466 --> 15:13.732
that killed people.

15:13.817 --> 15:15.814
You don't think he'll do it again?

15:15.880 --> 15:18.147
Kathy is clearly a skilled hacker,

15:18.172 --> 15:20.006
but we're gonna have to take
everything else she says

15:20.030 --> 15:21.092
with a grain of salt.

15:21.117 --> 15:23.300
I thought she was lovely.
I mean, got a bit

15:23.325 --> 15:25.412
of a hoarder vibe, but
definitely not evil.

15:25.437 --> 15:27.113
<i>Is she right about Loewe's
trading activity?</i>

15:27.137 --> 15:29.304
We confirmed it. He's shorted the stock.

15:29.738 --> 15:31.911
Volta's launching their
newest electric car tomorrow.

15:31.936 --> 15:33.723
An attack at a high
profile event like that

15:33.748 --> 15:35.248
would tank their stock.

15:35.273 --> 15:37.240
<i>We need to secure Volta's
corporate headquarters.</i>

15:37.265 --> 15:40.099
- She could be messing with us.
- We can't take the chance.

15:40.124 --> 15:42.143
<i>I want teams in place at
that launch tomorrow.</i>

15:42.168 --> 15:45.403
Fine, but let's keep a low profile.

15:50.098 --> 15:52.132
Rich! Rich!

15:52.420 --> 15:55.737
Kathy is telling the truth about
the attack on Volta Motors.

15:55.864 --> 15:59.899
- How do you know that?
- One of the unintentional byproducts

16:00.235 --> 16:02.636
of the way I coded the
app for Wizardville

16:02.825 --> 16:06.362
gives me backdoor access to
all my subscribers' phones.

16:06.421 --> 16:08.122
- What?!
- That's... Shh!

16:08.182 --> 16:11.222
Okay. You have access

16:11.247 --> 16:13.414
to over 75 million
people's contact lists,

16:13.439 --> 16:14.972
e-mail accounts, photo libraries.

16:14.997 --> 16:17.197
Okay, yes, but I've never used it...

16:17.245 --> 16:19.171
- until now.
- Oh, I totally believe you.

16:19.196 --> 16:20.671
Hey, is Hirst a subscriber?

16:20.696 --> 16:22.224
Oh, I bet she's got
some real dirty secrets

16:22.248 --> 16:24.275
- in her browser history.
- Okay, Rich, listen to me.

16:24.299 --> 16:25.855
Loewe's lawyer plays Wizardville,

16:25.880 --> 16:27.079
and I just hacked her phone.

16:27.104 --> 16:29.303
Someone e-mailed asking if Green Point

16:29.328 --> 16:31.138
was on for today at 3:00.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.968
That's where Volta's battery
factory is located.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.193
No batteries, no electric cars.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.871
An attack that size would
cripple Volta's stock.

16:38.928 --> 16:41.862
Which means we have less
than two hours to stop it.

16:43.345 --> 16:44.678
Come on.

16:46.320 --> 16:47.333
What? Let's go.

16:47.358 --> 16:48.396
You said an attack is imminent!

16:48.420 --> 16:49.832
Don't we have to tell the whole team?

16:49.856 --> 16:52.509
- We can't!
- Why not? What do you mean?

16:52.622 --> 16:54.088
- Hey, Gary.
- His name's Gary?

16:54.125 --> 16:56.428
- I've been calling him Rick.
- How did I get the intel?

16:56.461 --> 16:58.354
I can't say I used the illegal backdoor

16:58.379 --> 17:00.925
on my app to hack a lawyer's phone.

17:01.165 --> 17:03.999
Well, now who's obstructing justice?

17:05.111 --> 17:06.688
You're right.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.448
Okay, we need to come clean.

17:09.513 --> 17:11.339
Whoa, whoa. No. No. Gross.

17:11.385 --> 17:12.925
We need to stay dirty, okay?

17:12.958 --> 17:15.425
Just let me think here.
Just give me a second.

17:17.221 --> 17:19.121
Oh! Okay. I got it.

17:19.356 --> 17:21.490
I know how to fix this. Come on.

17:25.641 --> 17:26.796
What's so urgent?

17:26.925 --> 17:29.167
We know how Loewe's going
to short the Volta stock.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.827
An anonymous tip just came in.

17:31.624 --> 17:33.206
<i>There will be an attack</i>

17:33.231 --> 17:35.771
<i>on the Volta Motors battery factory</i>

17:35.796 --> 17:38.410
<i>in Green Point at 3 p.m. today.</i>

17:38.435 --> 17:41.467
<i>That's 1500 hours... hours... hours...</i>

17:41.534 --> 17:43.485
The recording goes on for a while,

17:43.575 --> 17:45.608
but it says the information came

17:45.653 --> 17:47.253
from deleted e-mails in Loewe's account.

17:47.278 --> 17:49.679
The same way Kathy found out
about the train derailment.

17:49.783 --> 17:51.047
Could she be the source?

17:51.096 --> 17:52.656
Not unless she can astral project.

17:52.681 --> 17:54.433
She's been in holding this whole time.

17:54.472 --> 17:55.938
Patterson, call in backup,

17:55.963 --> 17:57.730
I want Hazmat and emergency
vehicles on site.

17:57.829 --> 17:59.295
Wait. What about Hirst?

17:59.324 --> 18:01.258
Shouldn't we verify this tip
before we send teams out?

18:01.282 --> 18:03.159
No, we don't have the time.
If we're wrong,

18:03.187 --> 18:05.319
I'll take the heat. If we're
right, we save lives.

18:05.344 --> 18:06.977
So, let's move.

18:13.128 --> 18:15.039
<i>All right, ladies, it appears
that most of the chemicals</i>

18:15.063 --> 18:17.110
are directly beneath
the production floor.

18:17.135 --> 18:19.068
My guess is they're gonna
try to hit that hard.

18:19.093 --> 18:20.113
<i>We're headed there now.</i>

18:20.137 --> 18:21.883
<i>I've instructed all emergency vehicles</i>

18:21.907 --> 18:23.640
to be on standby outside the facility.

18:23.665 --> 18:24.831
We need to start the evac.

18:24.856 --> 18:26.503
- Copy.
<i>- We're gone.</i>

18:26.713 --> 18:28.827
FBI! Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

18:28.852 --> 18:31.138
Take your weapons out and
put them on the floor now.

18:31.163 --> 18:33.315
Don't shoot, whatever you do.

18:33.340 --> 18:36.043
You set off a spark, and
the whole building blows.

18:39.092 --> 18:42.093
Cut the gas lines. We got 'em, Jane.

18:44.000 --> 18:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

18:54.267 --> 18:56.121
Bomb! Less than two minutes!

19:01.321 --> 19:03.455
Patterson, I'm sending a pic of an IED.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.325
We need a little help here. We've
got less than two minutes.

19:15.522 --> 19:18.023
So, it looks like the keypad
lock is connected to the timer.

19:18.048 --> 19:19.981
Can you disconnect the
bomb from the timer?

19:20.006 --> 19:21.537
Maybe close the circuit somehow?

19:21.562 --> 19:23.271
No, don't touch the wires on the timer.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.830
- That can speed up the clock.
- Sorry.

19:24.855 --> 19:27.156
I'll figure out if I can
find the blasting cap.

19:27.186 --> 19:28.254
Give us a minute.

19:28.279 --> 19:29.354
Yeah, well, that's about all you've got

19:29.378 --> 19:31.345
until this whole place blows!

19:31.625 --> 19:33.978
Hey! What's the code?

19:36.149 --> 19:37.515
Look, unless you want to die,

19:37.577 --> 19:39.709
you need to stop this clock now.

19:40.324 --> 19:41.427
No, no, no, no! Don't!

19:44.964 --> 19:46.720
- Are you crazy?
- You've got 30 seconds.

19:46.745 --> 19:48.578
What's it gonna be?

19:51.044 --> 19:52.845
Good choice.

19:55.396 --> 19:58.338
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!

20:12.666 --> 20:14.433
How the hell did you
know how to do that?

20:14.621 --> 20:16.767
I have a lot of new tricks.

20:21.945 --> 20:23.996
Well done out there.

20:24.021 --> 20:26.351
Any luck linking the guys
from the factory to Loewe?

20:26.376 --> 20:28.744
They say they were hired
by a "John Smith"

20:28.769 --> 20:30.769
who paid them via wire transfer.

20:30.794 --> 20:33.027
I tried to track the money,
but it was a dead end.

20:33.052 --> 20:34.409
So, we have nothing on Loewe?

20:34.434 --> 20:36.258
I know this doesn't feel like a win,

20:36.283 --> 20:38.917
but we just averted a catastrophe today.

20:39.159 --> 20:41.773
We'll get Loewe... big fish like him

20:41.798 --> 20:43.732
just takes a little time to reel in.

20:43.977 --> 20:46.077
Go home. Get some rest.

20:47.266 --> 20:49.834
Good work out there.

20:50.624 --> 20:51.994
Hey, so correct me if I'm wrong,

20:52.019 --> 20:53.184
but I think the investigation

20:53.209 --> 20:55.610
into the Three Blind Mice is over.

20:56.309 --> 20:59.410
It certainly seems that way.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.774
I'm so sorry, but we don't
keep that kind of data

21:03.799 --> 21:05.525
- on our Kinga devices.
- Right.

21:05.550 --> 21:07.169
So, you just magically know which ads

21:07.194 --> 21:08.423
to target to which customers?

21:08.462 --> 21:10.102
I understand your "official" policy,

21:10.127 --> 21:11.760
but we know how this really works.

21:11.785 --> 21:13.095
I wish I could help, but...

21:13.120 --> 21:15.420
Your company has a data
farm in Centerville, right?

21:15.989 --> 21:17.643
Yes. So, what you're telling us is,

21:17.668 --> 21:19.802
if we were to send a team
over there with a warrant,

21:19.827 --> 21:22.286
we wouldn't find any recordings
of any Kinga devices?

21:22.335 --> 21:24.270
No, sir. 'Cause I'd hate
to have to come back here

21:24.294 --> 21:25.666
and arrest you for
giving a false statement

21:25.690 --> 21:26.875
to a federal agent,

21:26.900 --> 21:28.267
not to mention embarrass your company

21:28.291 --> 21:30.958
and have your stock take a tumble.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.985
Let me see if there's
something I can do.

21:33.010 --> 21:35.524
No, don't see. Just do.

21:36.349 --> 21:38.249
I want the recordings by end of day.

21:55.216 --> 21:57.387
- Ah!
- All right.

21:57.686 --> 21:59.094
I realize we shouldn't
be seen with each other,

21:59.118 --> 22:00.618
but this is a little overkill.

22:00.643 --> 22:01.776
Then why'd did you have me

22:01.801 --> 22:03.475
come meet you out here in this dump?

22:03.571 --> 22:07.273
- You texted me, dumbwad.
- Uh-uh-uh, you texted me.

22:08.504 --> 22:09.844
Oh, no.

22:09.924 --> 22:11.019
Rich!

22:11.262 --> 22:12.609
Are you okay?

22:19.092 --> 22:20.530
Oh!

22:28.457 --> 22:30.724
- Kathy?
- It's okay, guys.

22:30.749 --> 22:32.510
They're just bean bag rounds.

22:32.535 --> 22:34.554
I'm rescuing you!

22:34.669 --> 22:36.229
No. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no!

22:47.598 --> 22:49.751
Patterson. Hey.

22:51.252 --> 22:52.853
What the hell is this place?

22:52.878 --> 22:54.472
It smells like manure.

22:55.119 --> 22:57.295
You know...

22:58.807 --> 23:00.273
You know, just once, I'd like to get

23:00.298 --> 23:03.633
kidnapped somewhere exotic
like Mykonos, Ibiza.

23:03.892 --> 23:06.183
It's always got to be some dungeon,

23:06.394 --> 23:08.182
and not the good kind of dungeon.

23:08.207 --> 23:10.405
Hey, look. There's a door.

23:10.430 --> 23:12.838
Oh... okay.

23:12.876 --> 23:13.970
Okay. Wait, Rich.

23:14.015 --> 23:16.582
Rich, wait!

23:16.851 --> 23:17.984
Are you okay? Are you okay?

23:18.009 --> 23:19.608
- Are we wearing shock collars?
- Yeah.

23:19.633 --> 23:22.388
- Oh.
- She must have set up a perimeter.

23:22.413 --> 23:23.547
Oh, my God. She's gonna make us

23:23.571 --> 23:24.689
play The Hunger Games, isn't she?

23:24.713 --> 23:26.526
- Get it off. Get it off.
- I don't know where the...

23:26.550 --> 23:27.847
Hi, guys.

23:27.969 --> 23:29.831
Have a seat. Get cozy.

23:31.266 --> 23:32.866
Are you guys all right?

23:32.917 --> 23:36.352
Can I get you a soda or something?
A snack?

23:37.193 --> 23:39.588
You don't have any
soft pretzels, do you?

23:40.003 --> 23:41.654
What do you want with us, Kathy?

23:41.861 --> 23:45.561
I know this must be
upsetting and confusing,

23:45.597 --> 23:47.830
but it's gonna be okay now.

23:47.855 --> 23:51.139
The Three Blind Mice, reunited again.

23:51.168 --> 23:55.143
I got your clue! The
blade pass frequency?

23:55.170 --> 23:57.623
Who else would know that? And you.

23:57.648 --> 23:59.189
"Opposite, opposite."

23:59.214 --> 24:01.414
How many times did you write
that in our text chats?

24:01.439 --> 24:03.433
Who else says that?

24:03.759 --> 24:05.274
Yeah, who else does say that?

24:05.299 --> 24:07.329
- Rich, shut up.
- Don't tell me to shut up.

24:07.354 --> 24:09.254
Wait. Oh, my God.

24:09.279 --> 24:12.494
Oh, my God. Rich Dotcom?

24:12.519 --> 24:14.353
You're Rich Dotcom, aren't you?

24:14.378 --> 24:16.144
I knew it!

24:16.169 --> 24:20.329
This whole time, I was working
with a living legend!

24:20.421 --> 24:22.821
Oh, aren't you sweet.

24:22.850 --> 24:25.131
I don't know about legend

24:25.299 --> 24:27.683
or what you're talking about.

24:27.769 --> 24:32.558
Okay. You got us. We're
your old partners.

24:32.746 --> 24:35.476
Kathy, you've got to let us go.

24:35.535 --> 24:36.703
You can't do this.

24:36.728 --> 24:39.396
You know, when I first realized

24:39.421 --> 24:41.577
you two were working
together without me,

24:41.602 --> 24:44.323
and for the Feds, of all people,

24:44.348 --> 24:46.829
I'm not gonna lie...
that was a low for me.

24:46.854 --> 24:49.452
But then I realized, you're victims.

24:49.477 --> 24:52.562
You got caught and the
government brainwashed you.

24:52.587 --> 24:54.617
And back in that interrogation room,

24:54.717 --> 24:57.925
that was you subconsciously
asking for help.

24:58.172 --> 24:59.672
The longer you keep us here,

24:59.697 --> 25:01.908
the worse it's gonna be for
you when they catch you.

25:01.933 --> 25:04.834
Oh! Listen to yourself.

25:05.300 --> 25:06.778
They've gotten in your heads.

25:06.803 --> 25:08.736
They've infected you.

25:09.217 --> 25:11.084
You did kind of sound a lot
like Weller just then.

25:11.108 --> 25:14.543
But I'm here now, 'cause
that's what friends

25:14.568 --> 25:16.353
- do for each other.
- Okay.

25:16.470 --> 25:20.223
You're safe with me, and we
can get back to our work.

25:20.601 --> 25:22.798
God, I missed this!

25:22.843 --> 25:25.844
- Here.
- What is this?

25:26.046 --> 25:27.512
It's our to-do list.

25:27.628 --> 25:29.995
You want us to break into
the Federal Reserve,

25:30.217 --> 25:32.919
steal medical records
for every world leader?

25:32.944 --> 25:35.918
What do you need all of these
social security numbers for?

25:36.498 --> 25:39.792
Kathy, come on, you don't
need us for these hacks.

25:39.946 --> 25:42.928
I know I don't need
you, but what's the fun

25:42.960 --> 25:45.118
of doing them alone when
we're all together,

25:45.143 --> 25:48.511
the way it was meant to be?

25:48.569 --> 25:52.889
You guys have forgotten how
much fun we used to have,

25:52.940 --> 25:54.495
and I'm gonna remind you.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.419
We can't do these things.

25:56.443 --> 25:59.371
We righted wrongs. This
is not what we stood for!

25:59.396 --> 26:00.462
We helped people.

26:00.487 --> 26:03.654
I think it's high time for a rebrand.

26:13.946 --> 26:15.847
Hmm.

26:19.307 --> 26:20.800
- Here, bud.
- Thanks.

26:22.704 --> 26:24.526
- Mm-hmm.
- Here, love.

26:24.551 --> 26:25.851
Thank you.

26:26.123 --> 26:28.456
Uhh!

26:28.481 --> 26:29.682
You play Wizardville, right?

26:29.707 --> 26:30.786
Oh, I'm obsessed.

26:30.811 --> 26:32.010
Kurt says I have a problem.

26:32.035 --> 26:33.434
You do. Tasha.

26:33.804 --> 26:36.405
Okay, explain that.

26:36.631 --> 26:38.718
That noise... What is it
and how do I turn it off?

26:38.743 --> 26:40.834
Oh, it's telling you there's
a high-level player

26:40.859 --> 26:42.525
on the same Wi-Fi.

26:43.049 --> 26:44.790
But that's weird, because
it's definitely not me

26:44.814 --> 26:46.881
and Kurt's never played before.

26:49.043 --> 26:51.896
Reade? Zapata?

26:52.730 --> 26:54.763
Something you wanna tell me?

26:55.158 --> 26:56.517
No.

26:56.542 --> 26:58.310
- What level are you on?
- Well, first of all,

26:58.334 --> 26:59.417
they're called "quests," not "levels.

26:59.441 --> 27:01.281
- Really? You too?
- Oh!

27:01.306 --> 27:03.329
Why didn't you tell me, huh?
Because you were embarrassed.

27:03.353 --> 27:05.954
No, because you're ultra
competitive and bossy,

27:05.979 --> 27:07.512
and the last thing I
need is for you to be

27:07.536 --> 27:09.448
trying to tell me how to
play a damn video game.

27:09.473 --> 27:10.904
Oh, okay. I'm gonna kick your ass.

27:10.929 --> 27:12.876
You won't know a Hobbit
from a hole in the ground.

27:12.900 --> 27:14.476
There's no Hobbits in Wizardville.

27:14.501 --> 27:15.806
We'll see when I'm done with it.

27:15.831 --> 27:17.295
That doesn't make sense. Shh!

27:17.320 --> 27:18.894
<i>Mira.</i>

27:19.388 --> 27:21.540
Okay, we need to get
word out to the team.

27:21.565 --> 27:22.923
How do you propose we do that?

27:22.948 --> 27:24.600
We're wearing shock collars,
for crying out loud.

27:24.624 --> 27:26.023
She's not gonna let
us make a phone call.

27:26.025 --> 27:27.513
We've got one play here,

27:27.538 --> 27:29.560
- and that's to go along with her plan.
- No.

27:29.562 --> 27:30.976
No. We are not doing those hacks.

27:31.001 --> 27:32.907
Listen to me. I've got
a lot of experience

27:32.932 --> 27:34.680
with obsessive, psychotic women

27:34.705 --> 27:36.393
who desire me sexually, all right?

27:36.418 --> 27:38.142
Look, I don't have time to
explain the subtle nuances

27:38.166 --> 27:39.697
of nonverbal flirtation
with you right now.

27:39.721 --> 27:42.122
- What is your point?
- We've just got to live out the fantasy

27:42.146 --> 27:43.468
for a little while, okay?

27:43.493 --> 27:45.054
We just do a couple of
the less harmful hacks

27:45.078 --> 27:47.725
and then, when we're best
friends again, we say,

27:47.750 --> 27:49.317
"Hey, you know what
would make this easier?

27:49.341 --> 27:51.231
Taking off the Running
Man shock collars."

27:51.256 --> 27:53.183
No. We work for the FBI, Rich.

27:53.208 --> 27:54.643
We can't just hack...

27:55.102 --> 27:57.740
What do you say, Blind Micers?

27:57.889 --> 27:59.688
Ready to rock?

28:01.000 --> 28:02.752
- We're in!
- Yes!

28:02.777 --> 28:04.352
Okay, I've already hacked

28:04.377 --> 28:06.477
into Congressman Shusterman's tablet.

28:06.502 --> 28:09.436
The rest is up to you.
And no funny business.

28:09.784 --> 28:13.420
You try to contact your
"friends" at the FBI

28:13.445 --> 28:16.179
and we turn those collars up to 11.

28:17.925 --> 28:19.391
That does not sound right.

28:19.416 --> 28:21.462
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:21.943 --> 28:23.643
Patterson just sent me an e-mail.

28:24.050 --> 28:25.905
She's bailing on us
for dinner with Rich.

28:25.930 --> 28:27.105
- What?
- Yeah.

28:27.130 --> 28:29.206
Give me that. I'm gonna tell
her to get her butt over here.

28:29.230 --> 28:31.697
See? Bossy for no reason.

28:32.746 --> 28:36.251
Wait. She signed with her first name.

28:36.898 --> 28:38.898
She never uses her first name.

28:41.081 --> 28:43.049
She replied to my text with an e-mail.

28:43.364 --> 28:44.730
Something's wrong.

28:44.866 --> 28:46.297
It's our responsibility

28:46.322 --> 28:49.456
to make the Internet a safe
place for our children.

28:49.525 --> 28:52.358
<i>That's why I support Proposition 77.</i>

28:52.821 --> 28:56.522
Together, we can stop predators.

29:01.635 --> 29:03.681
Shut it down!

29:03.859 --> 29:05.425
Shut it down!

29:07.588 --> 29:08.968
Watching you guys,

29:08.993 --> 29:13.028
it's like watching Picasso
paint the Mona Lisa.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.961
Right. So, can you let us go now?

29:15.986 --> 29:19.521
After one hack? No. That
was just the warm up.

29:19.628 --> 29:21.361
Can we choose off the list?

29:21.386 --> 29:22.963
Because, you know what?
I've already hacked

29:22.987 --> 29:24.889
most of the Kardashians, so I could
just give you what I have on my phone.

29:24.913 --> 29:27.116
Kevin Loewe is piloting his Gulfstream

29:27.141 --> 29:29.808
to Martha's Vineyard with
his wife as we speak.

29:30.285 --> 29:33.634
I just need you to crash
it into the ocean.

29:41.827 --> 29:44.980
- You want us to crash a plane?
- This one's his.

29:45.026 --> 29:47.264
You're in charge of
manipulating the flight deck

29:47.266 --> 29:50.112
and air traffic control, okay?
And this one's hers.

29:50.137 --> 29:51.635
You will be breaching the firewalls

29:51.660 --> 29:54.754
while I break the codes,
just like old times.

29:54.779 --> 29:57.914
No, no, no, no, no, no. No,
this is murder, Kathy.

29:58.123 --> 30:00.521
Exactly. Just like how it was murder

30:00.546 --> 30:04.582
when Loewe's little "accident"
cost my brother his life.

30:04.789 --> 30:05.804
What?

30:05.829 --> 30:08.434
My brother was on the
train that Loewe crashed,

30:08.481 --> 30:11.535
and I gave the FBI everything it needed

30:11.560 --> 30:14.068
to put him away forever, and
your friends did nothing.

30:14.114 --> 30:17.930
Kathy, I am so sorry, but
there is a right way

30:17.955 --> 30:19.655
and a wrong way to do this.

30:19.876 --> 30:22.282
No, we're ridding the world of a man

30:22.307 --> 30:24.473
who kills innocent
people to make a buck.

30:24.788 --> 30:27.292
This is public service at its best.

30:27.358 --> 30:29.384
She kind of has a point.

30:30.420 --> 30:32.370
Kathy, you have every right to be angry

30:32.395 --> 30:34.862
about your brother, but
we are not executioners,

30:34.986 --> 30:37.720
and Loewe's wife didn't kill anybody.

30:38.929 --> 30:40.473
Rich, don't do this.

30:40.524 --> 30:42.725
You've worked so hard to get
where you are now right now,

30:42.749 --> 30:44.382
on the right side of the law.

30:44.634 --> 30:48.469
You're going to be a
tough walnut, aren'tcha.

30:49.274 --> 30:51.067
Don't get sucked into this.

30:51.267 --> 30:53.295
Do you want to go back to prison?

30:53.470 --> 30:55.248
This woman is crazy.

30:55.645 --> 30:56.921
And I'm starting to think

30:56.946 --> 30:58.531
you're not a very good friend.

31:04.525 --> 31:06.592
She just doesn't get us.

31:06.662 --> 31:09.429
Now, don't make me shock you.

31:10.056 --> 31:11.962
Patterson and Rich's phones are off.

31:11.987 --> 31:13.986
Agents confirmed neither
of them are at home.

31:14.011 --> 31:15.260
I tracked Patterson's e-mail.

31:15.285 --> 31:16.919
The IP address was from Antarctica.

31:16.944 --> 31:18.201
Just like the Loewe hacks.

31:18.226 --> 31:19.529
You think Kathy's behind this?

31:19.554 --> 31:22.121
- How? She's in custody.
- Not anymore.

31:22.475 --> 31:26.466
She paid her $2 million
bail in cash two hours ago.

31:26.525 --> 31:27.878
Why was bail even set?

31:27.929 --> 31:30.085
Looks like her big-time
lawyers negotiated it.

31:30.138 --> 31:32.593
Hey, a team found
Patterson and Rich's cars

31:32.618 --> 31:34.191
in an abandoned lot in Brooklyn.

31:34.216 --> 31:35.615
No sign of them anywhere.

31:41.999 --> 31:44.532
Okay. Once I hit "enter,"

31:44.587 --> 31:46.913
Loewe's plane will disappear
from the ATC radar.

31:47.307 --> 31:49.904
Thirty seconds after that,
it will begin its nosedive.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.606
And two minutes from now,

31:51.744 --> 31:54.275
it will be sinking to the
bottom of the Atlantic.

31:54.376 --> 31:57.278
Tell me you didn't miss this.

31:57.335 --> 31:59.563
You know, you're right. I
haven't felt this much

31:59.588 --> 32:02.456
like myself in a long time.

32:12.140 --> 32:14.462
Oh!

32:14.704 --> 32:17.405
I think this calls for a celebration!

32:22.361 --> 32:24.288
We went down the list of all
the places Kathy's worked

32:24.312 --> 32:26.118
as an IT consultant over
the past ten years.

32:26.143 --> 32:28.460
One of her former employers
was the Richmond Zoo.

32:28.485 --> 32:29.685
Didn't that place shut down?

32:29.710 --> 32:30.943
Over six months ago, but someone turned

32:30.967 --> 32:32.099
the power on this afternoon.

32:32.124 --> 32:33.132
An abandoned zoo.

32:33.157 --> 32:35.080
Not a bad place to hold someone captive.

32:35.105 --> 32:36.757
Right. Let's do it.

32:37.506 --> 32:40.577
Mmm, this is absolutely fantastic.

32:41.369 --> 32:43.196
I should've had you pegged for a foodie.

32:43.221 --> 32:45.855
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.913
Is this foie gras?

32:48.131 --> 32:49.872
Kinda.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.058
Today has been perfect.

32:52.162 --> 32:54.329
Cheers, Rich Dotcom.

32:55.318 --> 32:56.785
<i>Enchanté.</i>

33:00.020 --> 33:02.610
Wait, why is someone here?

33:02.672 --> 33:05.149
How did they find us?

33:05.189 --> 33:07.844
Was this you, Rich? Did you do this?

33:07.869 --> 33:08.904
No! I swear!

33:08.929 --> 33:11.030
You've been standing
over me this whole time.

33:11.303 --> 33:13.102
It was you, wasn't it!

33:13.258 --> 33:15.291
No...

33:15.732 --> 33:18.927
No! No! Loewe's plane landed?!

33:19.030 --> 33:21.597
How is that possible? You crashed...

33:21.622 --> 33:24.797
Wait, how could you do this to me?
We're friends!

33:24.822 --> 33:26.113
You know what? I'm gonna go ahead

33:26.137 --> 33:27.382
and blame this on the auto-pilot.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.939
Stop lying to me!

33:30.613 --> 33:31.914
Unh!

33:35.285 --> 33:37.407
Looks like your FBI friends are driving

33:37.432 --> 33:40.032
a standard government issue SUV.

33:40.110 --> 33:42.811
This is almost too easy.

33:43.013 --> 33:44.869
Okay, so, according to the ConEd report,

33:44.894 --> 33:46.374
the building pulling
all the power is just

33:46.398 --> 33:47.833
straight ahead on the main road.

33:47.858 --> 33:49.324
Copy that.

33:52.128 --> 33:53.686
What the hell?!

33:56.194 --> 33:58.394
It's Kathy... she's hacking the car.

33:59.723 --> 34:01.457
I can't brake and I can't steer!

34:01.552 --> 34:03.302
Cut the power!

34:06.809 --> 34:08.909
Front doors out! Go!

34:24.846 --> 34:28.916
I'm sorry about your new friends...
sort of.

34:28.958 --> 34:31.434
You know, I used to dream

34:31.458 --> 34:34.571
of the day we'd finally
meet face-to-face.

34:36.976 --> 34:39.679
This is not how I pictured it.

34:44.174 --> 34:46.166
When we first met in that chat room,

34:46.190 --> 34:49.703
it's like I finally felt
like I belonged, you know?

34:50.061 --> 34:52.672
I thought you guys understood me,

34:52.841 --> 34:54.908
you liked me.

34:58.648 --> 35:00.347
Yes?

35:00.828 --> 35:03.062
Did you have some final words?

35:03.885 --> 35:06.844
I-I wanted to apologize...

35:07.409 --> 35:08.890
for betraying you.

35:09.077 --> 35:10.958
Thank you.

35:11.006 --> 35:12.839
We were a good team.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.493
We were more than that.

35:16.004 --> 35:17.837
We had something special.

35:18.254 --> 35:21.268
We took down a lot of
very bad people, and...

35:23.258 --> 35:24.625
we were friends.

35:24.772 --> 35:27.374
We were, weren't we?

35:27.864 --> 35:29.743
You inspired me.

35:29.818 --> 35:30.874
You know that?

35:30.913 --> 35:35.149
Your moral compass that
never wavered, not once.

35:35.411 --> 35:39.119
You made me want to do
something good with my life...

35:39.336 --> 35:42.656
to help people...

35:42.724 --> 35:46.326
Which is why this hurts so bad.

35:51.402 --> 35:52.469
Kathy, no!

35:52.494 --> 35:54.461
Goodbye, Rich!

35:58.627 --> 36:00.394
Jane, find the fuse box!

36:04.527 --> 36:06.071
Kathy Gustafson, you're under arrest.

36:09.299 --> 36:10.639
All right? I'm okay.

36:10.664 --> 36:11.780
Patterson!

36:11.805 --> 36:14.601
- Rich!
- It is not foie gras!

36:14.806 --> 36:17.446
He's fine.

36:20.236 --> 36:22.270
- Mixed with Polysporin.
- Yeah, I know, but...

36:22.379 --> 36:23.563
You guys all right?

36:23.588 --> 36:25.023
Just some minor burns.

36:25.048 --> 36:27.695
Hirst wants to make tracking
the other Mice a top priority.

36:27.729 --> 36:29.974
We've been working Kathy
over in interrogation...

36:30.000 --> 36:31.166
Yeah, but unfortunately,

36:31.221 --> 36:33.221
she refuses to give up her partners.

36:34.857 --> 36:36.925
Says she's a mouse, not a rat.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.488
She's really committing
to this mouse bit, huh?

36:40.223 --> 36:43.292
What I don't get is why she
chose to kidnap you two.

36:43.741 --> 36:44.854
It's pretty risky,

36:44.879 --> 36:46.843
going after an FBI agent
and her consultant.

36:46.868 --> 36:48.582
Hmm. Yeah, uh, she was a...

36:48.712 --> 36:50.812
huge Rich Dotcom fangirl.

36:51.008 --> 36:52.841
I didn't know that was a thing.

36:54.577 --> 36:56.278
All right, here's my take on it.

36:56.504 --> 37:00.452
Kathy was a part of an elite
three-person hacker team,

37:00.531 --> 37:02.131
but she never met the other two members.

37:02.986 --> 37:04.553
Right.

37:05.142 --> 37:07.201
Now, this hacker team

37:07.277 --> 37:10.011
probably started out with good
intentions, like she said,

37:10.093 --> 37:12.062
but when everything went sideways,

37:12.149 --> 37:14.728
the other two members just cut loose.

37:14.946 --> 37:16.412
They left her hanging.

37:16.700 --> 37:18.509
That had to hurt her feelings.

37:18.723 --> 37:21.144
Well, I mean, you know,
she's only human, right?

37:21.169 --> 37:23.334
Now what if over the course of today,

37:23.434 --> 37:26.668
she figured out who the
other two partners were.

37:33.983 --> 37:36.679
I bet she'd be very angry at them,

37:36.987 --> 37:39.536
maybe even want to kidnap them.

37:39.897 --> 37:41.951
It's a shame we don't
have any hard evidence,

37:41.976 --> 37:44.443
because if we did I'd
be forced to charge

37:44.468 --> 37:47.436
those two members to the
full extent of the law.

37:47.896 --> 37:49.464
Yeah, that would be pretty bad.

37:49.627 --> 37:52.961
For them, you know, whoever they are.

37:53.242 --> 37:56.110
Look, what really concerns
me is that this tattoo

37:56.135 --> 37:58.502
wasn't just about Loewe.

37:58.542 --> 38:00.465
It was about exposing secrets of people

38:00.490 --> 38:02.757
who may or may not be in this very room.

38:02.833 --> 38:06.434
Like when the Perseus tattoo
revealed Jane's K and R work.

38:06.781 --> 38:09.284
Roman wants to expose things about us.

38:09.433 --> 38:12.667
The question is... why?

38:18.571 --> 38:21.299
Sorry I'm late. Got that.

38:21.445 --> 38:23.358
That smells awesome. What is it?

38:23.717 --> 38:25.060
Vegan lasagna.

38:25.289 --> 38:26.678
No.

38:26.703 --> 38:28.752
- It's a new recipe.
- Awesome.

38:29.973 --> 38:31.873
Okay, I am making you a steak,

38:31.875 --> 38:33.708
medium rare, just like you like it.

38:34.249 --> 38:36.841
Okay, so have I told
you that I love you?

38:36.866 --> 38:38.216
It's been a couple hours.

38:38.241 --> 38:39.325
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

38:39.327 --> 38:40.549
So, can I say it again?

38:40.624 --> 38:42.857
- Yes.
- I love you. I love you.

38:43.089 --> 38:44.397
Oh, I love you.

38:44.399 --> 38:45.487
- I love you, I love you!
- Aah!

38:45.511 --> 38:47.056
- I'm gonna jump in the shower.
- Okay.

38:47.081 --> 38:48.622
No, you're coming.

38:48.647 --> 38:49.808
No, I'll be right there.

38:50.277 --> 38:52.310
No. No, no, no. I'll be right there.

38:52.335 --> 38:53.835
All right, I'll be quick!

38:53.860 --> 38:54.905
Hello?

38:54.930 --> 38:57.397
Hello, Jane. How are you?

39:03.489 --> 39:04.656
What do you want?

39:04.681 --> 39:07.015
I want to know what
it's like being back...

39:07.040 --> 39:09.209
with your husband, your old job,

39:09.234 --> 39:10.933
<i>all your old friends...</i>

39:10.958 --> 39:12.124
These new tattoo cases...

39:12.149 --> 39:13.716
You're trying to take us
down with them, aren't you?

39:13.740 --> 39:16.140
This new person you've become...

39:16.463 --> 39:18.592
you refuse to see the bad in anyone.

39:18.665 --> 39:20.999
Oh, so you're doing this to protect me?

39:21.222 --> 39:22.775
No.

39:23.610 --> 39:25.663
You betrayed me, sis.

39:25.735 --> 39:28.236
I'm doing this to make you bleed.

39:28.396 --> 39:30.932
There's not a day I don't
think about you...

39:31.372 --> 39:33.965
about what happened between us.

39:34.588 --> 39:38.323
I live with my guilt and
the pain of where we are.

39:39.312 --> 39:41.013
I'm already hurting.

39:41.568 --> 39:44.469
You don't know the
meaning of the word...

39:45.139 --> 39:46.873
but you will.

39:47.088 --> 39:49.021
And I'm going to enjoy every minute...

39:49.046 --> 39:51.246
of watching you suffer.

39:57.103 --> 39:59.037
Hey, I thought you went home.

39:59.273 --> 40:01.013
I wanted to do a quick analysis

40:01.038 --> 40:02.838
of the Kinga recording you got us.

40:02.863 --> 40:04.162
Now, have a listen.

40:08.088 --> 40:09.721
That's it? No voices?

40:09.746 --> 40:11.774
Nothing during the time
of Stuart's murder?

40:11.805 --> 40:13.029
Which is weird.

40:13.054 --> 40:16.456
What's also weird is this noise
I isolated from this clip.

40:17.961 --> 40:19.060
A siren?

40:19.085 --> 40:20.485
Yeah. Now listen to this.

40:24.718 --> 40:25.894
You just played that.

40:25.953 --> 40:29.155
No, what I played was from
earlier that same day.

40:29.304 --> 40:31.571
Someone copied this section
and spliced it in later.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.503
Someone's trying to cover up
the time of Stuart's murder.

40:34.660 --> 40:36.627
Who would have access to do this?

40:36.652 --> 40:38.085
Someone very powerful.

40:38.279 --> 40:40.846
Okay, there's something else.
I was finally able

40:40.871 --> 40:43.042
to unlock the tattoo that
Stuart was obsessed with.

40:43.067 --> 40:44.414
Let's quit sweating the small stuff

40:44.438 --> 40:46.768
and focus all our energy
on this one tattoo.

40:46.854 --> 40:49.372
If you write out the
molecular structure,

40:49.397 --> 40:52.742
the atomic bonds look like normal lines.

40:52.767 --> 40:54.564
If you zoom in to a microscopic level,

40:54.589 --> 40:56.166
there are actually dozens of lines

40:56.191 --> 40:58.391
made of three different thicknesses.

40:58.519 --> 41:00.352
It's a code.

41:00.377 --> 41:03.011
Long story short, each of these letters

41:03.036 --> 41:05.236
spell out the names of
over a dozen people.

41:05.261 --> 41:07.242
I ran vector searches to try to see

41:07.267 --> 41:09.158
if there were any
connections between them.

41:09.183 --> 41:10.916
It turns out, each of those people

41:10.941 --> 41:12.436
were previous owners...

41:12.461 --> 41:14.961
of Van Gogh's famous self-portrait.

41:15.169 --> 41:16.285
Meaning?

41:16.310 --> 41:17.955
That's where I'm stuck.

41:17.980 --> 41:20.080
So all we know is, on
Stuart's last day alive,

41:20.105 --> 41:21.995
he was trying to decode
this Van Gogh tattoo.

41:22.020 --> 41:23.720
What does a one-eared painter have to do

41:23.745 --> 41:25.639
with the murder of an FBI agent?

41:33.926 --> 41:36.294
Did you follow my instructions?

41:37.971 --> 41:40.328
I did everything you asked me to do.

41:46.793 --> 41:49.761
Then you'll never have to see me again.
