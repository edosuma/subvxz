00:00.920 --> 00:02.740
Previously on rescue me....

00:02.890 --> 00:08.140
The french girl,she's here-- the one
that's writing the book about 9-11.

00:08.220 --> 00:09.000
Come on.

00:09.130 --> 00:11.160
You don't have to talk to
her if you don't want to.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.910
I should assume you're not
interested in being involved?

00:13.960 --> 00:15.620
You know what?It's just a date to you.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.050
No,I don't want to talk about it.

00:18.720 --> 00:22.360
Can you do a french accent?

00:22.450 --> 00:25.700
French accent?Why?

00:25.760 --> 00:28.880
Because it could be....hot,you know?

00:29.740 --> 00:34.760
So if tommy were to find out that one of the guys
in the crew was doing something behind his back

00:34.820 --> 00:37.010
- that he might not be so--  Oh,my
god,you're sleeping with colleen.

00:37.070 --> 00:37.950
How'd you know?

00:38.090 --> 00:40.090
- What?
- So is that bad?

00:40.210 --> 00:41.680
So he's sitting there
on the couch,right?

00:41.710 --> 00:44.670
The couch I paid for,by the way,and talk
about creepy,sticks his hand in the--

00:44.790 --> 00:48.610
I'd like you,this time,you
come over here and put it here.

00:48.660 --> 00:49.810
What if that doesn't appeal to me?

00:49.860 --> 00:50.990
I'm gonna kick your ass.How's that?

00:51.060 --> 00:52.000
Get the chair,janet.

00:52.070 --> 00:52.910
Get the chair!

00:52.990 --> 00:55.150
- I didn't know that you were--
 Are you backin' down now?

00:55.220 --> 00:57.200
You're not gonna believe it,but
I found it,I bought the bar.

00:57.270 --> 01:00.190
I got the goddamn floor,ok?

01:00.270 --> 01:03.100
We're buying the bar together.I mean,it's my
money,but we're gonna be running it together.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.750
Now we gotta think of a name,guys.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.540
Derek was wondering if
you would be his sponsor.

01:07.610 --> 01:10.740
I promise not to call
or bother you too much.

01:10.830 --> 01:14.050
Don't worry about that.You
just,you know,call me whenever.

01:14.120 --> 01:17.200
I know it's been 40 minutes
since I last saw you.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.640
Has it been that long?

01:19.730 --> 01:22.580
Colleen and me,we're together.

01:22.740 --> 01:24.450
There you have it.

01:24.780 --> 01:28.250
So....what you gonna do?

01:31.390 --> 01:34.300
1131 in progress,41st and 2nd avenue.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.060
10-4.62 truck responding.

01:37.480 --> 01:41.090
We got a pregnant broad
about to bust on 41st street.

01:42.940 --> 01:44.790
- All right,give us some room here,people.
- Look out,folks.

01:44.890 --> 01:47.450
Hey,what do you say we flip a
coin,3 out of 5,gets to cut the cord.

01:47.530 --> 01:48.590
- Right.
- Oh,my god.

01:48.660 --> 01:50.430
Holy shit.

01:50.490 --> 01:54.140
- My water broke and I can already feel the baby coming out.
- Ok,honey,I got it under control.

01:54.200 --> 01:55.450
- Don't worry about it.
-Get off the blanket.

01:55.570 --> 01:57.610
Get off-- ok,sweetheart,you're
already dilated,ok?

01:57.700 --> 01:59.050
- What's going on?
- Holy shit.

01:59.110 --> 02:00.380
- Is that the head?
- Yeah,that's the head.

02:00.450 --> 02:02.630
What a pussy.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.150
Sorry,sorry.

02:05.280 --> 02:07.660
Yeah,push. Good.

02:07.790 --> 02:09.350
Push,honey.Ok.

02:09.479 --> 02:10.960
Oh....oh,my god.

02:11.150 --> 02:13.210
It's a boy.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.140
Oh,my god.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.370
Oh,man.Jesus.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.230
Yeah.

02:17.290 --> 02:19.120
Wait.Look,look.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.750
- What?
- Oh,honey,there's a second one coming.

02:20.830 --> 02:22.390
- You're gonna have to give me a push again.
- What?

02:23.380 --> 02:25.340
Come on,honey.Come on.

02:25.430 --> 02:26.290
What,garrity fainted?

02:26.350 --> 02:27.540
- Yeah.
- What a wuss.

02:27.590 --> 02:28.780
Tell me about it.

02:30.580 --> 02:32.440
Goddamn it.

02:32.540 --> 02:34.710
What's wrong with these guys?They
can't take the miracle of childbirth?

02:34.810 --> 02:35.730
Apparently not.

02:35.810 --> 02:36.900
Ok,honey,one more.

02:37.730 --> 02:38.650
Breathe.

02:38.730 --> 02:39.910
Yeah,that's it.Good job.

02:39.980 --> 02:41.710
There you go.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.040
It's another boy.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.470
There you go.

02:44.590 --> 02:47.410
Look at that.Jeez.Twins,huh,grandpa?

02:47.540 --> 02:49.650
- Yeah.
- Let's hope they don't turn out like these two mooks.

02:49.710 --> 02:50.630
Yeah.

02:50.710 --> 02:52.280
Oh,I'm gonna name them after you,daddy.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.490
I love you.

02:53.570 --> 02:54.590
You did a great job.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.150
Uh,maybe you'll name
the third one after me?

02:56.290 --> 02:58.740
Look.Oh,my god.Honey,there's
another one coming.

02:58.810 --> 02:59.920
- You're gonna have to start pushing again,ok?
- What?

03:00.040 --> 03:01.620
Ok.Ok. Ok.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.410
- How's she doing?
- She's all right.She's doing fine.

03:03.460 --> 03:07.510
And the first two we know are definitely
yours,but no word yet on the color of number 3.

03:07.570 --> 03:08.780
Here,I'll take this one.

03:08.850 --> 03:10.890
Don't give him a baby.What if
he passes out like the other two?

03:11.350 --> 03:12.630
I ain't gonna pass out,tom.

03:12.710 --> 03:13.550
This one's for you.

03:13.730 --> 03:18.580
I'm just happy that I'm here to support
my beautiful wife that I adore and love.

03:18.650 --> 03:19.470
I love you.

03:19.540 --> 03:21.520
What'd you say?Wife?Did you say wife?

03:21.580 --> 03:25.040
Yeah,we were gonna tell
y'all tomorrow after dinner.

03:25.180 --> 03:26.910
You guys--you
got married?

03:26.990 --> 03:30.980
Yeah,we went down to city hall and
had a private ceremony last weekend.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.990
So it's legal?

03:35.220 --> 03:37.750
It's official,pop.

03:39.980 --> 03:41.740
Hey,tom.Bad dream?

03:42.340 --> 03:43.940
Yeah.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.340
Derek.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.910
It's a little early in the morning
to be thinking about booze,isn't it?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.030
I'm not thinking about booze,pally.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.160
I'm dreaming about it.

04:46.230 --> 04:47.320
Yeah.You know what?Hang on a second.

04:47.350 --> 04:48.740
I got another call.I'll call you back.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.590
I can hold,pally.

04:50.650 --> 04:52.870
You know what?Just hang on a sec.

04:54.850 --> 04:55.770
Hello.

04:55.900 --> 04:57.350
What's going on?

04:57.430 --> 05:00.840
Just talking to my sponsee for
the millionth time this week.

05:00.880 --> 05:01.880
This guy's unbelievable.

05:01.920 --> 05:04.240
I mean,I'm gonna have to change my
goddamn plan on my phone,you know?

05:04.290 --> 05:08.610
Do they have like an unlimited,you know,number
of minutes for self-absorption and whining?

05:08.660 --> 05:10.280
You don't have that one already?

05:10.340 --> 05:11.540
Oh,you're so funny.

05:11.620 --> 05:13.410
You know,he keeps calling me pally.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.460
How about that?

05:14.560 --> 05:16.390
Hey,listen,you talk to teddy recently?

05:16.460 --> 05:18.230
No.Why?

05:18.280 --> 05:21.640
Ellie says he didn't come home last
night,and she can't get him on his cell phone.

05:21.740 --> 05:24.870
If he calls you,tell
him to call her,will you?

05:24.940 --> 05:26.410
Yeah,hang on a second.I
got another call,all right?

05:26.530 --> 05:28.080
Hang on.

05:28.410 --> 05:31.050
Get
this--it's him.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.900
I've got him on hold,and
he's still calling me back.

05:33.990 --> 05:36.310
It's like he cloned himself
so he can call me more.

05:36.420 --> 05:37.480
Jesus.

05:37.580 --> 05:39.250
All right,well,I'll
talk to you later,pally.

05:39.310 --> 05:41.130
Very funny,asshole.

05:41.820 --> 05:43.630
Hey,I thought you were gonna hold.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.320
Yeah,but I was worried
about this martini thing.

05:45.460 --> 05:46.750
What martini thing?

05:46.800 --> 05:48.650
The dream I had.

05:48.680 --> 05:49.580
What should I do?

05:49.650 --> 05:50.760
You know what,derek?I
don't know what to tell you.

05:50.810 --> 05:52.750
Either stay awake or
grab onto the olive.

05:52.800 --> 05:53.930
I gotta go,ok?

05:54.010 --> 05:55.300
Ok,pally.

05:55.350 --> 05:58.690
You know,can
you--oh,you son of A....

05:58.840 --> 06:02.390
So,uh,I was told you beat the section 8.

06:03.300 --> 06:06.140
You know,I did.The guy,ends up
that he was a friend of yours.

06:06.180 --> 06:07.670
A lot of luck you have,huh?

06:07.720 --> 06:11.380
You better hope your luck holds up,'cause
the next time you step out of line--

06:11.440 --> 06:14.370
and since it's you,it
could happen at any time--

06:14.460 --> 06:18.120
I'm gonna make it stick at headquarters and make
sure they boot your bony ass the hell out of here.

06:18.170 --> 06:18.960
- Ok,chief,chief,chief--
 Yeah,yeah.

06:19.140 --> 06:21.710
No,no.I thought we could
start,you know,like a new leaf.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.980
Save it,asshole.

06:27.320 --> 06:31.140
Ok,so I admit I messed up with the
while lumberjack theme for a bar.

06:31.220 --> 06:33.370
Well,let's put it this
way: You're a dipshit.

06:33.470 --> 06:38.390
Frank,I got a new idea for a theme that I
guarantee you nobody has ever thought of.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.810
There's not another bar
like it anywhere.You ready?

06:40.920 --> 06:42.080
This should be good.

06:42.140 --> 06:47.460
The whole entire place and
everything in it....is black.

06:47.550 --> 06:52.790
The bar,the floor,the walls,the ceiling,the
table,the chairs,the glasses,everything.

06:52.860 --> 06:55.100
And like that's not
brilliant enough,right?

06:55.150 --> 06:57.690
- The name of the
place--  White.

06:58.270 --> 06:59.440
Who told you that?

06:59.500 --> 07:01.010
Lucky guess.

07:01.210 --> 07:03.030
You like?

07:03.130 --> 07:04.720
Um,I don't know,mike.

07:04.780 --> 07:08.390
You name the bar "white," you run the
risk of sending the wrong message,you know?

07:08.450 --> 07:09.970
Like it's for whites only or something.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.660
I didn't think of that.

07:13.170 --> 07:15.760
But,I mean,you'll be hanging
out there all the time,right?

07:15.810 --> 07:22.240
So maybe you could,like,kind of hang out in front of
the window so people of color know it's cool to come in.

07:22.660 --> 07:25.990
You telling me my new job is to
be a goddamn cigar store indian?

07:26.130 --> 07:29.180
Um,well,I don't think you
can smoke in bars now,frank.

07:29.270 --> 07:33.140
But,I mean,look,I'm gonna paint the whole
place and buy all the glasses and everything.

07:33.190 --> 07:35.020
I just need to know
you're on board,dude.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.740
What does garrity say?

07:36.830 --> 07:38.560
Love it!

07:42.050 --> 07:43.220
Yo,man,what are you doing?

07:43.330 --> 07:45.100
Oh,my back is killing me.

07:45.150 --> 07:46.400
Yeah,that looks real comfortable.

07:46.470 --> 07:48.830
Yeah.It's the only position
that gives me any relief.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.950
You don't happen to know
a good back doctor,do you?

07:50.990 --> 07:53.980
You know what?As a matter
of fact,I got your back,bro.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.270
Sorry.

07:56.370 --> 07:58.950
There's a great back doctor right next
door to alicia's apartment building.

07:59.010 --> 08:01.140
I could give a call
and set you up today.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.780
You want to go after shift,or what?

08:06.350 --> 08:07.750
Sean-o?

08:08.490 --> 08:10.890
What happened?I think the blood rushed to
my head.I might have fainted a little bit.

08:10.930 --> 08:11.920
Did you say something?

08:11.990 --> 08:14.520
Would you like to see the doctor today?

08:15.100 --> 08:16.680
Yes.

08:22.470 --> 08:25.490
Why can't you just help me with damien?

08:25.530 --> 08:30.680
Tommy,my son needs a strong male role
model,and I can't be that,you know?

08:30.760 --> 08:32.549
So if he drops out
of college,guess what?

08:32.630 --> 08:34.289
It's gonna be your fault,not mine.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.480
He ain't my kid.

08:36.539 --> 08:41.020
You deal with it and stop relegating
your responsibilities to me.

08:42.260 --> 08:44.490
I wasn'T.I....

08:44.770 --> 08:49.340
I mean,at least I don't think
I w-- but even if I was,I--ooh.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.090
He doesn't talk that way.

08:52.350 --> 08:53.500
Excuse me?

08:53.570 --> 08:56.870
Tommy....he doesn't use
words like "relegating.

08:56.920 --> 09:03.160
"  That's why I said he ain't my kid,because
I thought the "ain't" would balance it out.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.890
It's not good.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.180
You know,I was a professional
actor for a while.

09:10.230 --> 09:16.800
I did a bus-and-truck tour of sugar
babies,and i attended amda before that.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.290
Amda?

09:18.360 --> 09:19.990
Isn't that men who like little boys?

09:20.010 --> 09:24.380
That's nambla: North american
man-boy love association.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.420
Somebody came up with that pretty quick.

09:26.490 --> 09:30.490
Amda stands for american
musical and dramatic academy.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.310
Oh,musicals.So they
are kind of the same.

09:32.340 --> 09:36.650
Hey,do you want to get help,or do you want
to be another goddamn critic in my life?

09:38.400 --> 09:40.650
That's a little better.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.450
Yeah.

09:45.770 --> 09:47.310
Hey,what do you think of genevieve?

09:47.380 --> 09:49.270
- The french chick?
-No,no,the monkey.

09:49.830 --> 09:51.020
I think she's kinda hot.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.720
- Yeah,very kinda.
- Yeah?

09:52.890 --> 09:53.990
Hey,guys..

09:54.070 --> 09:56.000
- Grab my irons,will you?
- You need a hand?

09:56.100 --> 09:57.070
Uh,no,I'm all right.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.180
Good?Fine?

09:59.120 --> 10:01.220
Hey,tommy,you know what?I gotta
tell you,I'm proud of you,man.

10:01.260 --> 10:02.370
Yeah,I'm a good lifter.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.170
No,I mean,you know,about colleen
and shawn finding out about that.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.090
I think you handled it like
a champ.And I'm proud of you.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.480
All right,you know
what?Put the chair down.

10:11.220 --> 10:16.170
In the 2-plus decades that you've known me,have
I ever given you even an inkling of the idea

10:16.250 --> 10:19.750
that I would be against one of
my daughters dating a black guy?

10:19.950 --> 10:22.250
No.I just like to hear you
say "inkling." Say it again.

10:22.430 --> 10:23.900
- Inkling.
- Say it again.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.340
- Inkling.
- One more time.

10:25.390 --> 10:26.260
No.

10:26.310 --> 10:28.150
Lookit,shawn and I had
our problems up front.

10:28.180 --> 10:29.840
Yeah,we butted heads a little
bit,but the kid's great.

10:29.880 --> 10:33.920
I mean,he's disciplined,he doesn't smoke,he doesn't
drink.I got nothing bad to say about the kid.

10:33.970 --> 10:36.710
Is he my first choice to date
colleen?No.But you know what?

10:36.720 --> 10:37.970
Pick it up.

10:38.470 --> 10:39.960
You know,I think you're real
lucky,too,about the whole,

10:40.030 --> 10:41.750
you know,deciding not to have sex thing.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.160
Yeah.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.820
- What?
- What,you didn't know that?

10:46.000 --> 10:47.310
What?They're not having sex?

10:47.350 --> 10:48.700
What?Why would they not be having sex?

10:48.780 --> 10:50.670
I don't know.

10:50.770 --> 10:52.220
Put the chair down.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.900
- Why are they not having sex?
- I don't know.

10:57.980 --> 10:58.920
Lou.

10:58.970 --> 11:00.540
No reason.

11:01.670 --> 11:03.300
They're waiting.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.300
Waiting for what?

11:04.390 --> 11:06.780
- Let's get this chair out of here.
- Lou.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.190
Until they get married.And....lift!

11:09.280 --> 11:10.640
Come on.

11:15.740 --> 11:16.920
- Are you sure you're all right
with that--  Yeah,we're all set.

11:16.990 --> 11:18.880
We're good.Thanks.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.730
That sneaky little black son of a bitch.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.890
Say inkling,say inkling.

11:28.310 --> 11:30.740
She's not getting married,I'm
telling you right now,ok?

11:30.780 --> 11:32.520
How did we go wrong?

11:32.580 --> 11:34.920
I mean,we purposely raised her
the wrong way,as a lapsed catholic.

11:34.950 --> 11:39.130
So now she should be,you know,enjoying
herself,on birth control,banging her brains out.

11:39.180 --> 11:43.790
But,you know,she wants to reclaim her virginity
and not have sex till she gets married.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.780
My daughter turned amish on me.

11:45.820 --> 11:47.060
How is that possible?

11:47.100 --> 11:48.330
Ok?She's not getting married.

11:48.370 --> 11:50.100
She's not gonna end up like
her mom,I'm telling you.

11:50.150 --> 11:52.450
What,what?What do you
mean,what?Gorgeous,40,and angry?

11:52.480 --> 11:54.700
- She's irish.
-She's gonna end up angry no matter what happens.

11:54.740 --> 11:57.880
She can't get married.I'm telling
you right now,ok?Too young.

11:57.950 --> 12:00.190
Look,you keep that tack up,they're
gonna get married even sooner.

12:00.250 --> 12:01.460
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

12:01.510 --> 12:03.120
I'm gonna talk to her,I'm gonna
have a conversation with her,

12:03.150 --> 12:04.570
and she's gonna end up
having sex with him,ok?

12:04.610 --> 12:06.300
She's gonna have lots of sex with him.

12:06.330 --> 12:09.840
She's gonna have so much sex that sex is
gonna turn into what it's supposed to be--

12:09.910 --> 12:14.380
a boring,monotonous chore,just like it is with everybody
else who's in a long-term intimate relationship,

12:14.430 --> 12:16.250
and then he's gonna get bored
and you know what's gonna happen?

12:16.310 --> 12:18.400
He's gonna leave and then we're
all set 'cause the marriage is off.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.210
- Problem solved.Right.
- So let me get this straight.

12:20.260 --> 12:24.260
You're actually gonna have a conversation with your
teenage daughter telling her to have sex with her boyfriend.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.050
Yes,I am.

12:27.130 --> 12:29.960
Could I sit in on that conversation,'cause
it's gonna be so creepy,

12:30.020 --> 12:33.400
it's gonna reset the high end of my
creep-meter for the rest of my life.

12:33.460 --> 12:35.710
Now,let's go.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.690
Jesus christ.

12:38.580 --> 12:40.180
Look,forget what the
media machine put out,ok?

12:40.270 --> 12:41.690
I know what I saw.

12:41.750 --> 12:45.010
I saw buildings exploding and
imploding,not falling down.

12:45.050 --> 12:48.860
When buildings fall due to structural failure,they
don't blow out windows across the street.

12:48.930 --> 12:54.340
And they damn sure don't collapse at free-fall speed
while following the path of greatest resistance.

12:56.730 --> 12:58.780
Something funny,mike?

12:59.170 --> 12:59.940
No,nothing.

12:59.990 --> 13:02.220
Yeah?Well,keep stepping,because
I'm talking here.

13:05.330 --> 13:07.290
Look,I'll cut to the chase.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.790
Fire engine magazine--on every coffee
table in every firehouse across the country,

13:10.830 --> 13:13.690
- said the official investigation
was--and I quote--  Frankie.

13:13.730 --> 13:15.470
Tommy.Was a half-baked farce.

13:15.540 --> 13:19.170
And,that giuliani may have committed a federal offense
in corrupting the crime scene by by allowing that--

13:19.260 --> 13:21.050
Excuse me.

13:21.170 --> 13:23.420
MR. Gavin,may I speak to you?

13:23.600 --> 13:25.320
Sure,yeah.

13:25.380 --> 13:27.170
Can we continue this another time?

13:27.260 --> 13:28.980
Yeah,I'm around.

13:34.090 --> 13:36.040
Um....wrote some things
down,you know,from the other day,

13:36.100 --> 13:41.220
when,uh--and I just wanted
you to check it for accuracy.

13:42.270 --> 13:43.570
I knew you were writing stuff down.

13:43.620 --> 13:47.540
I didn't really....
I was just sort of....

13:49.540 --> 13:52.650
did I really,uh--did
I call you A....

13:54.270 --> 13:56.360
sexy piece of foreign ass?

13:56.390 --> 14:03.090
Well,no,actually,you called me a hot foreign
piece of ass,but,um,sexy is just more poetic.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.260
You're right.

14:05.890 --> 14:07.820
Well,everything else is fine.

14:07.870 --> 14:09.090
Thank you.

14:09.140 --> 14:13.170
Uh,by the way,tomorrow
night,I'm invited to a gallery.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.440
A friend of mine is the artist.

14:15.610 --> 14:17.920
And,um,do you want to come?

14:17.990 --> 14:21.140
Are you--are you....
asking me out on a date?

14:21.220 --> 14:26.180
Well,I was thinking if i got you out
of the firehouse,um....you'd relax.

14:26.400 --> 14:27.910
I need to relax?

14:27.950 --> 14:29.320
You're very tense.

14:29.380 --> 14:32.770
It's the guys I work
with.Really not,uh....

14:35.040 --> 14:36.600
I'll give it a shot.

14:36.690 --> 14:39.310
- All right.Tomorrow night.
- All right.

14:39.450 --> 14:41.010
All right.

14:42.530 --> 14:44.390
- Bye.
- Bye.

14:45.190 --> 14:47.390
Hey,mikey.I heard
about the all-black bar.

14:47.490 --> 14:48.620
How's the painting going?

14:48.710 --> 14:49.860
Oh,good.I'll be done tomorrow.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.860
I got all the glass in,so you
gotta come and check it out.

14:51.940 --> 14:55.180
So what's up?You know,I was thinking
that we gotta have a rule,you know?

14:55.210 --> 14:58.280
None of that conspiracy
theory bullshit in the bar.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.420
You gotta leave that
shit at the door,right?

15:01.080 --> 15:02.530
Oh,boy.

15:02.590 --> 15:04.670
I assume that was directed at me?

15:06.160 --> 15:08.230
Uh,pretty much.

15:08.790 --> 15:10.490
You got a problem with me,mike?

15:10.830 --> 15:12.980
Yeah,yes,I do,in that particular area.

15:13.790 --> 15:15.630
And the problem would be what?

15:15.690 --> 15:19.040
I think it's weird and disrespectful
to all the guys we lost.

15:19.070 --> 15:21.440
Everybody who died that
day,frank,but mostly our guys,

15:21.490 --> 15:24.060
'cause what you're saying is they
weren't heroes,they were dupes.

15:24.100 --> 15:27.430
Well,maybe I get to say whatever the hell
I want,mike,because I was there on the day.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.400
Unlike you.

15:28.470 --> 15:30.020
It's disrespectful to the memories.

15:30.070 --> 15:33.080
No,dumb-ass.What's disrespectful is
swallowing that spoon-fed kool-aid

15:33.120 --> 15:35.840
that's parading as the official
account of 9-11 hook,line,and sinker.

15:35.870 --> 15:38.750
Like 99.9% of the people
in this goddamn country.

15:38.780 --> 15:40.750
I am honoring the memories
of those who were lost,ok?

15:40.780 --> 15:42.280
I'm honoring my brothers.

15:42.320 --> 15:47.100
My brothers,by asking questions,by picking at
threads,by not being some gullible dumb-ass chump

15:47.160 --> 15:49.720
who believes everything he
reads in the goddamn paper.

15:51.650 --> 15:54.860
Not another word of
that shit in this house.

15:54.950 --> 15:58.580
- You don't tell me when to shut
the hell up,you filthy-- shut up,man!

15:58.700 --> 16:02.390
- Shawn!Come on,enough!
- What,man,what?!

16:02.500 --> 16:03.780
Damn,think about it!

16:03.840 --> 16:05.110
You goddamn square-rooter!

16:05.200 --> 16:06.780
Yeah,whatever,frank.Think about it.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.490
Yeah,yeah.

16:09.530 --> 16:11.750
- Shawn.
- What?

16:11.940 --> 16:14.150
I'm not getting involved in
that shit.My back's killing me.

16:14.210 --> 16:15.320
You're fine.

16:15.380 --> 16:16.860
Come on,take a load off.

16:16.940 --> 16:18.150
Let him cool off.

16:18.250 --> 16:22.540
It's sort--it's sort of
like A....crowbar,hmm?

16:23.930 --> 16:25.800
Yeah,I--I
just said that.

16:25.840 --> 16:29.690
- Anyway--  Uh,why don't
you show him the bunker gear?

16:30.090 --> 16:33.150
Ok,um....bunker gear.

16:33.220 --> 16:34.870
It's--well,that's
the bunker gear.

16:35.180 --> 16:40.940
And,uh,you know,we.... get into it when we
get ready to jump in the rig and go to a fire,

16:41.000 --> 16:44.040
and it protects us,um.... in the fire.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.370
What's your name,again?

16:45.470 --> 16:47.540
Uh,kirk.Kirk johnson.

16:47.780 --> 16:49.880
Kirk.And how do you
guys know each other?

16:49.980 --> 16:51.040
From cooking class.

16:51.090 --> 16:52.350
Yep.

16:52.450 --> 16:55.060
Um,we are doing vietnamese this week.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.880
That's right.

16:58.030 --> 16:59.620
What'd you do last week?

16:59.720 --> 17:02.620
Um....oh,I forget.

17:02.690 --> 17:05.410
Uh....  It was thai.Remember?You
totally choked on that peanut.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.119
Yes,thai,of course.

17:07.220 --> 17:09.130
It was delicious.You
gotta watch those peanuts.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.290
Can I talk to you for a second?We have
to talk about certain family stuff.

17:19.349 --> 17:21.560
I don't know what to say.Ok?

17:21.599 --> 17:24.210
- What?
- You were taking a cooking class with this guy?

17:24.240 --> 17:25.230
- Yeah,ok.
- Yeah.

17:25.270 --> 17:27.920
I only talk about my cooking
class like a million times a week.

17:28.010 --> 17:29.680
You do,really?I've
never heard it before.

17:29.740 --> 17:31.420
Uh,maybe you don't listen to me?

17:31.510 --> 17:33.400
Ok....all right,benefit of the doubt.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.060
You know what i think,though?

17:35.150 --> 17:37.440
I think this is your--what
do you call that guy?

17:37.460 --> 17:42.180
That psycho-weirdo acting
teacher/slash/shrink,whatever the hell you call him.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.540
You are so retarded.It
is psychodramaturgy,ok?

17:45.660 --> 17:48.810
And no,that's not him.That
is my cooking class friend.

17:49.960 --> 17:53.360
I know he's your
dr.Finko-weirdo-psycho whatever.

17:53.450 --> 17:55.220
Zip!

17:55.350 --> 17:57.940
Psycho....drama....turge.

17:57.990 --> 18:01.630
- Ok?Say it with me.Psychodramaturge.
- ....Turd.

18:02.950 --> 18:05.070
Cooking class friend kirk.

18:05.130 --> 18:08.090
If he's kirk,I'm spock.

18:08.590 --> 18:09.250
He just took a picture of me.

18:09.350 --> 18:10.690
What?I didn't see that.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.550
The,uh,fire truck.I was just
taking a picture of the fire truck.

18:13.580 --> 18:15.890
Oh,yeah,yeah,no,no,go
ahead.Feel free.Yeah,yeah.

18:15.960 --> 18:19.470
Take pictures of whatever
you.... feel like.

18:19.550 --> 18:22.100
Ok,you
know,I--  What?

18:22.200 --> 18:24.390
I feel really sorry for you,tommy.

18:24.490 --> 18:26.440
- You for sorry for me?
- I do.

18:26.570 --> 18:31.830
Honey,your self-obsession is climbing
and scrabbling to such new heights

18:31.890 --> 18:35.100
that I can't bring my cooking class
friend kirk here to see the house,

18:35.160 --> 18:38.250
meet the boys,without you just
thinking it's all about you.

18:38.320 --> 18:41.360
If you were taking a cooking
class,it would be ok.Yeah.

18:41.660 --> 18:45.100
Thank you so much.You have now spoiled
this whole little trip for me and kirk.

18:45.170 --> 18:46.710
We will be running along now.

18:46.810 --> 18:51.860
Kirk. Kirk! Kirk.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.100
You know what I think happened?

18:54.340 --> 18:58.070
I think he forgot his fake name.Bye.

19:01.690 --> 19:03.140
Hi,aunt sheila!

19:03.290 --> 19:04.640
Colleen!

19:04.810 --> 19:08.840
Oh,you're so pretty and grown
up,you're making me feel old.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.950
Hi,dad.

19:11.010 --> 19:12.680
I'm just dropping of shawn's ipod.

19:12.750 --> 19:13.410
Oh,cool.

19:13.480 --> 19:17.590
Oh,colleen,this is one of my great
friends from my cooking class that I take.

19:17.670 --> 19:20.310
Uh,this is colleen,tommy's daughter.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.440
Hi,colleen.I'm kirk.

19:23.680 --> 19:28.060
Well....  Hey,would you mind if I got a picture
of you over there with that crowbar thingy?

19:28.330 --> 19:30.420
Uh,no. No. Come on,honey.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.990
Sorry.Nice to meet you.

19:35.470 --> 19:37.590
You see what I mean now,right?

19:37.660 --> 19:39.850
It's gonna be a tougher
case than I thought.

19:40.260 --> 19:41.450
Honey,come here.

19:41.570 --> 19:42.820
I want to talk to you for a second.

19:42.900 --> 19:43.850
Well,I really don't have time now.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.930
It's ok.Come here.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.310
Ok.

19:48.670 --> 19:51.350
So....how you doing?

19:51.470 --> 19:53.240
- I'm good.
- Good.Good.

19:53.260 --> 19:56.860
- You look.... great.
- Thanks.

19:57.010 --> 19:58.910
Is this new?It's nice.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.820
Um....yeah.Kinda.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.010
What did you want to talk to me about?

20:05.060 --> 20:11.750
Um,I just wanted to say
that,uh,your mother and i are--

20:11.860 --> 20:17.530
we're very proud of you,and,you
know,we think that shawn's great.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.760
- He is.
- Yes.

20:18.820 --> 20:19.870
And you know what?

20:19.940 --> 20:23.280
Being black thing
doesn't bother us at all.

20:23.370 --> 20:27.770
I mean,we've-- I think we've raised
you kids with that,you know,color,creed,

20:27.840 --> 20:32.290
relig--you know,none of that stuff
is--you know-- it doesn't matter to us.

20:32.320 --> 20:38.460
And,you know,love is--is a thing
that's,you know,it's a big....

20:39.160 --> 20:43.300
- uh,you know,it--it takes-- it
takes--it just happens.- Right.

20:43.340 --> 20:48.710
And when that happens,I think it's kind
of important to,you know,uh....what?

20:48.870 --> 20:50.210
What's the problem?

20:50.230 --> 20:53.700
There's no problem,honey.There's
no--that's why--I just want to--ok.

20:56.970 --> 21:00.160
If you were gonna buy a car,you
would test-drive it,you know?

21:00.190 --> 21:00.900
That's what I'm trying to say.

21:00.950 --> 21:02.560
- Oh,my god.
- There's more.Listen to me.

21:02.660 --> 21:04.970
Like,you know,if you're gonna test-drive a
car,you take it out and you drive it around,

21:05.020 --> 21:08.500
- and you maybe take it on the highway
and you--  Hey,coll,how you doing?

21:08.800 --> 21:09.730
You gonna buy a car?

21:09.810 --> 21:12.050
Is that what I heard?Good to see you.

21:12.160 --> 21:14.790
You know,my friend mark,he's got this
old jetta he's thinking of getting rid of.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.180
Yes,but you know what?She's
all set.She's got a car.

21:17.260 --> 21:18.400
Yeah.Yeah,I'm all set.

21:18.460 --> 21:19.490
45,000 miles.

21:19.550 --> 21:20.730
- Runs like brand-new.New
paint job.- No,we're all set.

21:20.810 --> 21:22.970
- All right.
- Thanks.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.630
- Ok.If you change your mind....
-  Ok.

21:27.190 --> 21:28.840
- Could you do that later?
- It's in my locker.

21:28.890 --> 21:30.520
Ok.

21:33.610 --> 21:34.920
Listen.

21:35.150 --> 21:39.230
I just think it's important that,you
know,you make sure that the parts fit.

21:39.270 --> 21:41.160
What parts?

21:41.510 --> 21:47.920
- You know the parts.And don't make me
say the parts--  His penis and my vagina?

21:48.180 --> 21:49.780
You guys aren't talking
about cars,are you?

21:49.880 --> 21:51.910
- Get out of here.
- I'm sorry.

21:53.310 --> 21:55.340
Ok.

21:55.490 --> 21:57.340
Are you actually telling
me to have sex with shawn?

21:57.440 --> 21:58.980
No!

21:59.830 --> 22:00.580
Kinda.

22:00.700 --> 22:04.400
I'm saying that I don't think it's
such a bad idea for you to do it,ok?

22:04.440 --> 22:05.670
You don't even have.....

22:06.670 --> 22:09.100
um,the whole thing,just--you
know,do the clinton thing,you know?

22:09.180 --> 22:10.860
- You don't have to go all the
way.Just do the--  Oh,my god!

22:10.950 --> 22:12.370
Honey,what?I thought
that would be easier.

22:12.440 --> 22:13.160
I'm
talking--what?

22:13.260 --> 22:16.580
- Are you telling me to-- 
No,I'm not telling you anything.

22:16.670 --> 22:18.950
- Oh,my god.Oh,my god.Dad--
 It's a suggestion.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.800
- I'm suggesting some substi-- to help you
with your belated--  I'm telling mom.Ok?

22:22.830 --> 22:25.240
Tell mom.
- This is so important that mom's gonna....

22:26.250 --> 22:27.480
don't tell mom.

22:27.540 --> 22:29.720
- Colleen,do not tell your
mother that--  Give this to shawn.

22:29.900 --> 22:30.950
Yeah,sure,sure.

22:32.660 --> 22:34.170
Bye,honey.

22:40.050 --> 22:40.940
MR. Garrity?

22:41.000 --> 22:42.540
I'm dr.Weisser.

22:42.630 --> 22:44.000
Yeah,hi.Hi there.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.460
You're having back pain.

22:45.560 --> 22:46.640
Yes,I am.

22:46.710 --> 22:47.950
Upper or lower?

22:48.110 --> 22:50.050
Uh....lower.

22:50.280 --> 22:54.780
The whole lower general back
of the....back of me area.

22:55.430 --> 22:56.540
Uh,new to the office?

22:56.650 --> 22:59.390
I am,yes,but a friend of mine
recommended you very highly.

22:59.460 --> 23:01.010
Excellent.

23:01.140 --> 23:03.520
I don't know how much
your friend has told you.

23:03.590 --> 23:07.760
My methods are
unorthodox to some people.

23:07.810 --> 23:09.230
Oh,I'm not jewish.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.170
Is that ok?

23:12.250 --> 23:13.770
But I do get results.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.760
Lie on the table facedown,please.

23:16.290 --> 23:18.010
Uh,ok.

23:22.870 --> 23:23.570
Are you ready?

23:23.750 --> 23:25.410
Uh,yeah,I think so.

23:30.430 --> 23:33.730
- Oh,hello--I--whoa--  Do you
want freedom from your pain?

23:33.830 --> 23:35.710
Um....yes,I do.

23:35.820 --> 23:37.250
You must trust me.

23:37.330 --> 23:38.320
Ok.

23:38.410 --> 23:40.590
Am I in the correct position?

23:40.670 --> 23:41.510
Yeah.

23:41.600 --> 23:45.790
- I mean,that's where my--  Are you feeling
pressure and warmth in the troubled area?

23:45.880 --> 23:48.870
Uh....yeah,I am,actually.

23:48.910 --> 23:51.690
It's not bad,really.I
mean,it's warm,that's for sure.

23:51.770 --> 23:53.870
- Now just relax.
- Ok.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.730
Relaxing.

23:57.790 --> 24:02.490
And.... That's a
little--yeah,that's--  Oh,my god.

24:02.660 --> 24:05.040
Uh,excuse me.Could
you--listen,I,uh...

24:06.410 --> 24:08.960
. I'm feeling a little,you
know,uncomfortable....

24:11.020 --> 24:12.930
With your methods here.

24:13.350 --> 24:15.820
I mean,I--I--
 Jesus christ!

24:17.620 --> 24:26.130
Excuse me--ok,yeah-- 
I think it's--ok--  Hey.

24:29.730 --> 24:31.570
Seen franco?

24:33.300 --> 24:34.180
Hey there.

24:34.250 --> 24:35.790
Yo,dude,I finished painting the bar.

24:35.860 --> 24:37.490
We're going to check it
out after the shift.You in?

24:37.540 --> 24:39.450
- Where's franco?
- I think he's up in the bunk room.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.900
- How's your back?
- Shut up.

24:44.730 --> 24:46.410
Hey,brother.How was the doctor?

24:47.520 --> 24:49.030
That's actually what i wanted
to talk to you about,franco.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.870
How many times you
been to see this broad?

24:50.940 --> 24:52.680
Me? Never.

24:53.510 --> 24:58.230
So what you're telling me is that you recommended a
medical professional that you actually know nothing about?

24:58.270 --> 24:59.550
Is that what you're saying?

24:59.600 --> 25:01.460
I guess.How was she?

25:01.680 --> 25:05.390
How.... it was great.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.460
Yeah?

25:07.620 --> 25:09.590
It was fantastic.Actually,you know what?

25:09.630 --> 25:12.410
Come to think of it,you
should go,bro.Seriously.

25:12.490 --> 25:13.680
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:13.790 --> 25:16.070
You know,I have been having
a little trouble with my back.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.060
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:17.160 --> 25:19.260
I don't know if you heard,but I got
into a little tussle with mike yesterday.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.450
I did hear that.I was sitting
right there at the table.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.380
But,you know,you should get
it checked out.Seriously.

25:23.440 --> 25:26.740
As a matter of fact,I'm going to make a call
and I'm going to set it up for later today.

25:26.810 --> 25:29.580
Uh,you know what,though,bro?I'm running a
little low on cabbage,so I probably shouldn't--

25:29.620 --> 25:31.860
Don't sweat it.It's on me,man.Seriously.

25:31.910 --> 25:35.000
It's the least I can do.It's just
a little thank you for your advice.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.420
Just a great big thank you.

25:36.510 --> 25:37.870
- I'm there for you.
- You're a good guy.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.670
Ok,pal.

25:40.180 --> 25:42.560
- Genevieve.Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

25:42.650 --> 25:43.690
Ca va?

25:43.770 --> 25:45.150
Ah,comme ci,comme ca.

25:45.190 --> 25:46.310
Deadlines,you know.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.630
Annoying people.

25:47.730 --> 25:48.900
Oh,yeah.I'm sorry to hear that.

25:48.960 --> 25:54.270
Um,listen I have,uh,I had something that I
thought you might be interested in for your book.

25:54.410 --> 25:58.250
Um,after 9-11,I--I
did some writing.

25:58.350 --> 25:59.460
Oh,you write.

25:59.510 --> 26:03.560
No,not really.But I,um,i
wrote--I wrote some--some poetry.

26:04.150 --> 26:10.530
And the guys didn't really understand
it,and I took a lot of shit for it.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.690
I'd rather not give you the stuff here.

26:12.750 --> 26:15.140
I was thinking maybe I could drop
it by at your place at some point.

26:15.230 --> 26:16.280
Ok.

26:16.360 --> 26:17.800
I just--I need
the address.

26:17.870 --> 26:20.470
Oh,yeah,um--oh,un
stylo.

26:20.590 --> 26:21.590
Ah,yes,stylo.

26:21.640 --> 26:22.880
Papier?

26:23.030 --> 26:25.190
I'm--I'm--I'm fresh
out of  papier.

26:25.400 --> 26:28.490
Why don't you,uh,just use my hand?

26:30.410 --> 26:31.550
This way I won't lose it.

26:31.620 --> 26:33.510
Well,I hope not.

26:36.360 --> 26:39.430
And I could just,you
know,uh,drop it off whenever.

26:39.470 --> 26:41.470
Pick a time and it'll be great.

26:41.590 --> 26:44.000
There  Yeah?

26:44.140 --> 26:46.260
Yes.

26:51.390 --> 26:53.740
Fire department!Hello!

26:53.790 --> 26:54.990
Come on,shawn,pop that door.

26:55.050 --> 26:56.490
Let's see you do it.

27:02.210 --> 27:03.540
Nice job,man.

27:04.400 --> 27:05.410
- Hey,tommy.
- Yeah.

27:05.590 --> 27:07.400
Did you tell colleen to go down on me?

27:07.680 --> 27:08.600
What?

27:08.670 --> 27:10.390
She said you said something
about bill clinton.

27:10.510 --> 27:12.000
You guys all right?

27:12.080 --> 27:13.750
Great,chief.All right.

27:14.540 --> 27:18.530
I just....  I just find this
shit very,very disturbing.

27:18.650 --> 27:20.480
- I didn't say it like that.
- No,no,no,no.Now here's the thing.

27:20.560 --> 27:24.580
I'm a good brother trying to keep it real,and
I'm trying to give the sex some meaning,

27:24.640 --> 27:28.380
and here you are telling her to go down
on me and service me in an oral fashion?

27:28.500 --> 27:29.990
What?

27:30.150 --> 27:31.600
See,this is the reason you
can't tell anybody anything.

27:31.640 --> 27:34.040
Because it gets blown out of proportion.

27:34.110 --> 27:37.330
Now,the blown isn't--I didn't mean
to say--  You see what I'm saying?

27:37.370 --> 27:39.780
Hey,guys,what are we doing
over here?You drinking coffee?

27:39.900 --> 27:41.270
- Come on!
- Ok.

27:41.430 --> 27:43.360
- Shawn,get a can on this!
- Ok.

27:43.440 --> 27:45.370
All I'm saying is I want to be strong.

27:45.440 --> 27:46.390
I want to stay focused.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.290
You want to stay focused?

27:47.330 --> 27:49.000
Let's go inside there and see
if there's anybody in there.

27:49.080 --> 27:52.170
And I'm gonna wait and give her that
good lovin' on our wedding night.

27:52.290 --> 27:53.790
You know what?

27:53.870 --> 27:57.470
All right.But you know what?You wouldn't
buy a car without test-driving it.

27:58.220 --> 28:02.330
I was a kid,maybe 16,and had
an argument with my father.

28:02.610 --> 28:06.650
Marched right out of the house and
went downtown and joined the army.

28:06.760 --> 28:09.230
2 days after that I was in fort dix.

28:09.390 --> 28:12.210
3 months after that,I'm in vietnam.

28:12.330 --> 28:16.330
Anyway,there was,um....
there was a guy in our outfit.

28:16.490 --> 28:17.820
Big guy.

28:17.940 --> 28:19.470
Built like a house.

28:19.900 --> 28:22.620
I said to him one
day,you seen the sergeant?

28:22.700 --> 28:26.540
He says,uh,"get lost.I
don't talk to kikes.

28:26.580 --> 28:28.560
" And he turns and walks away.

28:28.600 --> 28:35.350
The way he said that,his eyes,the
hate in his eyes was like....

28:35.430 --> 28:38.300
like I was some disease he could catch.

28:38.380 --> 28:43.210
About a week after that,we're out on
a patrol,when suddenly we hear this....

28:43.440 --> 28:46.340
whistling sound,a very piercing sound.

28:46.420 --> 28:51.990
And this mortar comes in and--bam--hits
him right in there and blows him to bits.

28:52.300 --> 28:57.790
I mean,he showered all over
us,bits of hair,bits of bone.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.190
One guy found an eye.

29:01.790 --> 29:05.510
This hateful eye staring
up from the ground.

29:06.990 --> 29:11.610
That night after mess,I was outside
the tent and....having a smoke,

29:12.240 --> 29:18.900
and I look up at the vietnamese sky and I
said.... quietly but out loud,thank you,god.

29:18.980 --> 29:21.530
One less asshole,right?

29:22.570 --> 29:25.270
Maybe a month after that we
got a letter from his family.

29:25.350 --> 29:27.000
His parents sent us a letter.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.490
Very nice.

29:28.610 --> 29:34.920
On the bottom it was
signed....dr.And mrs.Asher shapiro.

29:37.270 --> 29:39.390
I got nothing against god.

29:39.470 --> 29:41.120
It's religion.

29:41.190 --> 29:45.590
Religion that makes one guy hate
himself and call another guy a kike.

29:45.670 --> 29:49.100
And makes another guy praise
god that they killed his enemy.

29:49.220 --> 29:52.510
And this has been going
on for thousands of years.

29:52.750 --> 29:56.320
So what's another couple of towers?

29:59.220 --> 30:01.260
Next question.

30:03.460 --> 30:07.340
I gotta be honest.I
thought it kind of sucked.

30:07.380 --> 30:12.910
I mean,the paintings were interesting,but it
just looked like old leaves and like desert sand

30:13.030 --> 30:15.710
I ust blowing or
something,to me.I don't know.

30:15.830 --> 30:17.480
Well,you know,it's
like a renoir painting.

30:17.560 --> 30:19.810
The light is what inspires you.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.500
Yeah.

30:21.620 --> 30:26.510
But my friend says that she
was inspired by her vagina.

30:26.990 --> 30:29.300
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:29.460 --> 30:35.130
Well,I don't think desert sands and vagina are
words you want to hear in the same sentence.

30:35.260 --> 30:37.630
Yeah,I don't get it.

30:39.240 --> 30:43.260
So.... are you gonna make your move?

30:43.340 --> 30:45.450
I thought you were gonna
do it in the cab,but,um....

30:45.530 --> 30:47.620
I was--I
was....thinking about it.

30:47.660 --> 30:54.000
I have never really made-- --a
move on a french girl before.

30:54.170 --> 30:57.980
Actually,most of my moves have been
confined to the continental united states.

30:58.030 --> 30:59.210
I see.Ok.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.600
There was a french-canadian
girl in high school,but....

31:01.720 --> 31:04.080
I don't think that's
necessarily the same thing.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.480
Well,you know,if the
attraction is not there--

31:06.520 --> 31:10.410
No,no.No,no No,the attraction's there.

31:13.030 --> 31:18.330
Ok. Well,um....got some wine upstairs.

31:19.700 --> 31:27.200
I have a slight problem with the wine,just 'cause
I have a--I have a mild alcohol.... allergy.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.660
Actually,mild to raging.

31:29.770 --> 31:31.270
- Oh,well....
- Yeah.

31:32.090 --> 31:34.010
Uh,but I can do the upstairs thing.

31:34.090 --> 31:35.780
Oh?Ok.

31:36.130 --> 31:43.470
Are you....asking me upstairs 'cause you just want
to secretly pump me for information about your book?

31:43.540 --> 31:45.310
Absolutely.

31:46.330 --> 31:47.500
- All right.
- Ok?

31:47.540 --> 31:49.190
- Yeah.
- Yeah.Ok,good.

31:49.510 --> 31:52.290
I think I might have a
couple of chapters in  me.

31:52.370 --> 31:54.220
Oh,good,good.

31:58.060 --> 32:01.070
- MR. Rivera?
- Yeah.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.620
Uh....are you dr. Weisser?

32:03.680 --> 32:06.170
I'm one of them.My mother
and I practice together.

32:06.270 --> 32:08.120
Is this your first time in the office?

32:08.260 --> 32:10.420
- Yeah.
- Ok.

32:10.530 --> 32:14.160
I see from your chart here that you
have some soreness in your lower back?

32:14.270 --> 32:17.570
Yeah,yeah.I got in a little
tussle at the firehouse.

32:17.650 --> 32:20.010
I'm a firefighter.

32:20.440 --> 32:21.930
You should see the other guy.

32:22.130 --> 32:28.030
Ok.I'm gonna ask you to remove your
sweatshirt and lie on the table facedown.

32:28.270 --> 32:29.880
Ok.

32:30.030 --> 32:36.340
Now,before we begin,I want to tell you that some
people have found our methods to be a little unorthodox.

32:36.810 --> 32:40.310
Ok.

32:47.810 --> 32:49.100
Ok.

32:49.460 --> 32:52.200
I just want to stop for one
second.I just want to say something.

32:52.930 --> 32:55.560
Totally honest,up front.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.640
I'm with somebody.I'm living with
somebody.Long story short,it's not going great.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.570
Just wanted to tell
you,get it out of the way.

33:00.720 --> 33:02.640
Oh,it's ok.I have someone as well.I see.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.210
You probably have a boyfriend,right?

33:04.370 --> 33:05.730
No,no.My husband.

33:05.770 --> 33:06.830
You're married?

33:06.910 --> 33:08.320
Yeah,yeah.

33:08.440 --> 33:11.150
No,but it's all right 'cause
my husband has a mistress.

33:11.260 --> 33:13.060
- Oh,my god.
- Yeah.

33:13.180 --> 33:14.240
How'd you find out?

33:14.320 --> 33:15.650
Well,he told me.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.020
You french people,you crack me up.

33:18.140 --> 33:19.470
It's probably why you never go to war.

33:19.550 --> 33:21.240
You're too busy banging each other,huh?

33:26.060 --> 33:27.470
Can I say one other thing?

33:27.590 --> 33:30.100
Yeah.Go ahead.

33:30.490 --> 33:33.150
- That alcohol problem i mentioned?
- Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah.

33:33.270 --> 33:35.950
It's actually more raging than it is
mild.I haven't had a drink in like a year.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.720
But wait,wait,wait.

33:39.920 --> 33:41.330
Ok.

33:42.110 --> 33:44.030
Last thing. Last thing.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.800
I can't believe I'm saying this.

33:48.540 --> 33:50.790
I don't think we should sleep
together tonight.Let me explain.

33:50.910 --> 33:55.460
I just think-- I'm really attracted to you--
I've done it the wrong way a million times,

33:55.540 --> 33:58.440
and I just feel like maybe we
should do it the right way this time,

33:58.480 --> 34:01.150
which is to just let it
happen sort of in stages.

34:03.890 --> 34:04.880
What do you think?

34:04.990 --> 34:08.250
You know,I wouldn't want
to compromise your morality.

34:08.330 --> 34:11.370
No.No,no,I--
where's your coat?

34:11.520 --> 34:12.550
It's right there.

34:12.659 --> 34:13.880
Oh,you're upset now.

34:13.960 --> 34:15.989
No,no,not at all.No.

34:16.070 --> 34:17.600
Listen,we could still
do the kissing thing.

34:17.639 --> 34:18.699
That's not what I'm talking about.

34:18.780 --> 34:22.590
No,but,you know,I'm just
looking out for your morality.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.139
You're pissed.

34:25.210 --> 34:25.960
No.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.770
- Ok.
- Not at all.

34:27.889 --> 34:29.929
All right,so I should--I
can still call you.

34:30.010 --> 34:32.520
- Yes.
- All right.

34:32.989 --> 34:34.600
All right.

34:39.060 --> 34:42.940
So,guys.... what do you think?

34:47.139 --> 34:50.159
Well,it's--it's
certainly black.

34:50.270 --> 34:52.239
It's very black.

34:52.320 --> 34:57.560
Yeah.It's black like the inside
of A.... a really black thing.

34:58.230 --> 35:03.600
This is tie you up in a dark cellar,kill you
with a chain saw,cops can't find you black.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.120
- Yeah.
- Hey,turn up the lights.

35:05.390 --> 35:09.500
Well,we're having a little issue with the wir
but the electrician's downstairs fixing it now.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.870
Why don't you guys take a look around.

35:13.380 --> 35:14.830
At what?

35:14.950 --> 35:17.540
Well,there's a flashlight
under the bar,I think.

35:17.620 --> 35:18.600
Well,where the hell's the bar?

35:18.680 --> 35:20.480
It's ovhe tre,dude.

35:20.560 --> 35:22.760
Over where,bro?

35:23.150 --> 35:24.840
It's right there.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.580
All right.I'm going in.

35:26.620 --> 35:29.380
If I don't come back,call my
mother,tell her I love her.

35:31.350 --> 35:32.840
Son of a bitch!

35:32.920 --> 35:34.100
You ok?

35:34.180 --> 35:35.600
Yeah.Man down.

35:35.650 --> 35:37.230
All right,listen,I'm coming in.

35:37.300 --> 35:38.400
Stay where you are.

35:38.520 --> 35:40.140
That's all right.No problem.

35:40.340 --> 35:42.950
- Don't leave me.
- Garrity?

35:43.030 --> 35:44.010
Where are you?

35:44.130 --> 35:45.500
Shawn?

35:46.600 --> 35:48.220
- Shit!
- You ok?

35:48.340 --> 35:49.750
Damn it!

35:50.020 --> 35:51.980
Guys?

35:52.490 --> 35:54.300
Oh,jesus,you all right?

35:54.380 --> 35:57.760
That was scary.This floor's so
black,I didn't know how far I fell.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.720
Wait,where's black shawn?

35:59.840 --> 36:01.760
- Out there.
- What?

36:01.840 --> 36:03.450
Black shawn?

36:03.570 --> 36:07.030
If you can hear me,can you get some
ice from behind the bar for garrity?

36:07.310 --> 36:09.390
What the hell was that?

36:09.610 --> 36:11.540
A table,I think.

36:11.650 --> 36:13.220
Well,watch where you're going,dude.

36:13.340 --> 36:16.010
I can'T.You painted
everything black,dumb-ass.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.570
- Better go get the broom.
- I hope you didn't paint that shit black.

36:22.690 --> 36:24.100
Jesus.

36:25.510 --> 36:26.110
Hey,guys.

36:26.270 --> 36:27.920
Franco.

36:28.040 --> 36:30.230
Ho ho,shit.

36:30.350 --> 36:32.390
This place is black,mikey.

36:32.510 --> 36:34.600
Blacker than an asshole's asshole.

36:36.030 --> 36:37.210
Goddamn it!

36:37.290 --> 36:38.440
You all right?

36:38.480 --> 36:40.450
Yeah.This is definitely
not working,though,man,

36:40.490 --> 36:43.670
if I gotta wear a cup to
come into my own goddamn bar.

36:45.040 --> 36:47.040
There we go.

36:47.550 --> 36:50.020
The ice is over
here,dude,behind the bar.

36:50.100 --> 36:52.460
Yeah.Well,the broom's
in the back,dumb-ass.

36:52.620 --> 36:55.300
Come on!Ah,shit!

36:55.380 --> 36:56.450
So,yeah.What's up?

36:56.560 --> 36:58.020
I went to that back doctor.

36:58.090 --> 37:00.990
Oh,you did?Hey,look,I-- you know,I just
thought I had to punish you a little bit.

37:01.110 --> 37:04.870
- That was not cool,frankie--
 It was fantastic.

37:05.540 --> 37:08.450
- Are you talking about dr.Weisser?
- Yeah.

37:08.520 --> 37:11.780
Dr.Weisser,like this tall,climbed up on your
back,kind of rode you like a goddamn pony?

37:11.860 --> 37:12.800
Shit!

37:13.780 --> 37:15.000
Yeah,daddy.Yeah.

37:15.080 --> 37:18.030
When she was done on my back,I turned around and
let her ride my front,if you know what I mean.

37:18.150 --> 37:19.840
It was hot.

37:19.960 --> 37:21.140
You're a sick bastard.

37:21.180 --> 37:22.620
You know that,frank?You're sick.

37:22.780 --> 37:26.240
Ah,shit!This bar sucks.

37:28.080 --> 37:33.380
You know,frank,I got this uncle out on
staten island,and he,uh,he owns this company.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.770
They transport hazardous waste,and....

37:36.560 --> 37:41.430
I was gonna work for him,and a
couple days before.... 9-11 happened.

37:43.470 --> 37:49.980
And,uh.... you know,I watched the news and I saw the people
posting fliers around town looking for their loved ones,

37:50.100 --> 37:54.180
and I just really felt like I'm sure everybody
did,that I had to do something,you know?

37:55.840 --> 37:59.440
So....I decided to become a firefighter.

38:00.930 --> 38:04.620
You know--you know how a lot of kids
want to be firemen when they get older?

38:06.270 --> 38:09.280
I wanted to be a superhero.

38:09.320 --> 38:15.050
Even after I knew that they didn't really exist,I still
wanted to be one,because i wanted to fight the bad guys.

38:15.130 --> 38:17.090
You know?

38:18.400 --> 38:22.990
Frank.... what I'm trying to say
is that I became a firefighter

38:23.070 --> 38:25.250
because of what the
bad guys did on 9-11

38:25.330 --> 38:27.530
and if you're telling me
that there are other bad guys,

38:27.570 --> 38:31.730
and they're our leaders,our people,the people
who are supposed to be watching out for everybody,

38:31.810 --> 38:33.320
it's just too scary for me.

38:33.360 --> 38:35.720
I can't even think about that.

38:35.760 --> 38:39.110
I mean,I understand that there's evil in
this world,but I just feel a lot better

38:39.160 --> 38:42.420
when it comes from someplace
that I don't call home.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.650
Yeah.

38:46.160 --> 38:49.730
You say you were gonna take a
job transporting hazardous waste?

38:51.690 --> 38:53.220
Yeah,I was gonna be a driver.

38:53.300 --> 38:54.870
Jesus.

38:55.220 --> 38:57.730
Never thought I'd say
this,but thank god for 9-11.

39:14.260 --> 39:15.680
What's going on?

39:15.750 --> 39:16.850
Asleep,huh?

39:16.930 --> 39:22.910
Yeah,I was just--well,I was trying to wait up for you
in case you called to tell me where the hell you were.

39:22.980 --> 39:25.370
- Where the hell were you?
- I was at the thing.

39:26.780 --> 39:28.110
What thing?

39:28.190 --> 39:30.860
The,uh,thing I told you
I was going to,you know?

39:30.960 --> 39:32.110
I don't remember
you telling me--

39:32.500 --> 39:35.640
The thing that I told you I was
going to--the art gallery thing.

39:36.030 --> 39:37.870
You were at an art gallery thing?

39:37.910 --> 39:42.020
I told you that I was going to this art gallery thing
like 2 days ago--you're always forgetting stuff,honey.

39:42.100 --> 39:43.630
Ok,you know what?

39:43.710 --> 39:45.590
I--I'm
exhausted.

39:45.670 --> 39:47.590
I--I--it's too
late to fight.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.820
Could we fight in the morning?

39:50.090 --> 39:50.910
Where are you going?

39:50.990 --> 39:52.710
- I'm going to get,uh-- 
Just give me a hug good night.

39:52.780 --> 39:54.750
Ok.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.270
You smell like wine.

39:58.750 --> 40:00.980
Do I smell like wine?

40:03.060 --> 40:04.120
You were drinking.

40:04.160 --> 40:05.890
No--I--honey--come
on.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.970
- You were totally drinking.
- No No,no,no.No.

40:08.050 --> 40:10.020
Come on.I was at this art gallery thing.

40:10.100 --> 40:11.720
People were drinking
wine.So maybe--I don't know,

40:11.800 --> 40:14.860
I might have got some spilled
on me or something. You know?

40:17.060 --> 40:21.690
Ok.Remember I told you this chick
that was writing the thing about 9-11,

40:21.730 --> 40:24.440
that's doing the book about
9-11--she's been around the firehouse--

40:24.520 --> 40:27.360
Why are your eyes closed?Why are
you talking with your eyes closed?

40:27.440 --> 40:29.850
I'm not talking with my eyes closed.This
chick is writing a book about 9-11.

40:29.890 --> 40:33.030
She's been around the firehouse forever writing
this book about 9-11,talking to everybody.

40:33.070 --> 40:35.270
I didn't want to talk about 911 because
I don't want to talk about that stuff,

40:35.390 --> 40:38.300
and she talked to everybody about
9-11 except me,and she said,hey,

40:38.460 --> 40:41.830
will you finally come and talk to me,uh,

40:41.870 --> 40:44.620
maybe about 9-11 at this art
gallery thing outside the firehouse,

40:44.700 --> 40:45.930
'cause you won't feel so
embarrassed,which is true,

40:46.010 --> 40:50.010
so I went to the art gallery thing with her
and she--I didn't talk to her about 9-11,

40:50.090 --> 40:52.010
just-- so she
was drinking.

40:52.090 --> 40:57.200
And,you know,french people kiss you like
3 times,and so that's what,you know....

40:57.240 --> 40:58.970
That's what that is.

41:03.380 --> 41:05.700
No,no,no,no,no,no,no.You
got the total wrong idea.

41:05.740 --> 41:09.480
The french accent thing has
nothing to do with this--

41:09.560 --> 41:12.240
no,no,no,no--the french accent
thing is like an old fantasy of mine,

41:12.440 --> 41:14.610
which I thought was gonna be
really cool-- which it was--

41:14.690 --> 41:17.050
it was really hot the first time we did
it--but after that it was like,you know,

41:17.090 --> 41:18.670
it was--it
