00:20.083 --> 00:21.958
Come on, numbat, put the brakes on!

00:22.041 --> 00:25.750
We just wanna take you to a safe place
to breed you with some lady numbats.

00:26.541 --> 00:28.375

[grunting]

00:30.208 --> 00:31.958
God damn it. [grunting]

00:35.958 --> 00:36.875
Numbat.

00:36.958 --> 00:38.458
[blowing raspberry]

00:38.541 --> 00:40.291
I'm coming for you, stripey! Whoo!

00:40.375 --> 00:42.875
[grunts, groans]

00:43.500 --> 00:46.000
-[groaning] Blast these hefty nipples.
-[panting]

00:46.083 --> 00:49.166
Maybe you should go
with less heroic nipples next time.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.291
Yeah, I wasn't gonna say anything,
but your nipples are disturbing.

00:52.375 --> 00:53.375
Kind of like my mom's.

00:53.458 --> 00:56.916
I'll have you know, these nipples
are zoologically sound and resolute.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.875
You have no idea what a numbat mother
has to go through.

01:00.500 --> 01:04.291
<i>A nursing numbat carries up to four babies</i>

01:04.375 --> 01:05.625

01:05.708 --> 01:07.666
<i>-It makes her extremely vulnerable.</i>
-[growling]

01:07.750 --> 01:09.333
<i>So, for a numbat mother,</i>

01:09.416 --> 01:12.541
<i>evading a predator</i>

01:16.125 --> 01:18.750
Bite down, kids. We're gonna miss the bus!

-[screams]

01:20.458 --> 01:21.541
Oh, gee, sorry!

01:21.625 --> 01:22.791
Oh, God! Sorry, ma'am!

01:23.916 --> 01:26.666
Out here, it's death by baby.

-I don't see any sign of him.
-[laughs]

01:38.708 --> 01:41.416
It's all right.
All we have to do is follow the termites.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.416
Every termite is a numbat feast
waiting to happen.

01:45.083 --> 01:47.083
Hey, Dietrich, quick question.

01:47.166 --> 01:50.458
Why are you carrying around
a watermelon with a creepy face?

01:50.541 --> 01:53.458
Are you referring to Melon Baby?

01:54.458 --> 01:56.541
[gasps] Sweet baby bunny balls!

01:56.625 --> 01:58.083
He has his mother's eyes.

01:58.166 --> 02:00.583
Why would you desecrate
innocent fruit like this?

02:00.666 --> 02:02.000
Like I told you this morning,

02:02.083 --> 02:04.208
to prove to Margie
I'd make a great father.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.375
We did not have that conversation.

02:06.458 --> 02:09.708
And then Margie said
she doesn't think I'm father material.

02:09.791 --> 02:12.958
So, I said,
"I'll bring a watermelon into the jungle!"

02:13.041 --> 02:16.583
Like the sex ed class egg.
You know, that egg baby thing.

02:16.666 --> 02:19.875
-[music playing on headphones]
-Yeah, except a jungle melon baby!

02:19.958 --> 02:21.333
Ten times harder.

02:21.416 --> 02:25.833
And when I bring it back in one piece,
she'll have no choice but to marry me.

02:26.583 --> 02:27.958
Huh? I'm sorry, what?

02:28.041 --> 02:31.958
Huh. I assumed slash hoped
you were talking to someone else.

02:33.041 --> 02:34.583
Hello, hello.

02:34.666 --> 02:35.708
[sniffing]

02:35.791 --> 02:38.083
[licking] Hmm.

02:38.166 --> 02:41.416
Didn't the doctor tell you
to stop eating red mystery goo?

02:41.500 --> 02:44.250
Male numbat chest gland scent markings.

02:44.333 --> 02:45.666
And this must mean that--

02:45.750 --> 02:47.375
[gasps] Numbat!

02:47.458 --> 02:48.541
[chittering]

02:50.125 --> 02:51.625
[BTG grunting]

02:53.125 --> 02:55.458
Oh! Hello, mommy koala.

02:55.541 --> 02:57.666
-So sweet.
-[koala snarling]

02:57.750 --> 02:58.833
Oh God!

02:58.916 --> 03:02.125
That baby is choking on his mother's butt!
My worst nightmare.

03:02.208 --> 03:03.708
Dude, you need therapy.

03:03.791 --> 03:06.708
-But my mom is my therapist.
-That explains a lot.

03:06.791 --> 03:08.125
He's fine, Dietrich.

03:08.208 --> 03:11.708
Before they're fully weaned,
koala joeys feed off their mother's pap,

03:11.791 --> 03:13.458
which is really just fancy poop

03:13.541 --> 03:16.541
that prepares their gut
for an adult diet of eucalyptus leaves.

03:16.625 --> 03:18.833
That baby koala is eating poop?

03:18.916 --> 03:21.958
Wait. Will my human baby
have to eat my poop?

03:22.041 --> 03:25.458
I hope not, Dietrich,
but parenthood is wonderfully disgusting.

03:25.541 --> 03:26.875
[leaves rustling]

03:26.958 --> 03:27.958
Numbat.

03:30.208 --> 03:31.625
I see you, numbat.

03:32.958 --> 03:34.083
-[urinating]
-[screams]

03:34.166 --> 03:36.000

[grunts, coughs]

03:40.416 --> 03:43.125
-Uncle B! Are you okay?
-Oh, that stings.

03:43.208 --> 03:46.125
It's like a eucalyptus martini
mixed with hot urine.

03:46.208 --> 03:48.833
[gasps] Gross. Here, flush it out.

03:49.416 --> 03:50.500
Oh, that burns!

03:50.583 --> 03:52.541
Is this… [sniffing] grapefruit juice?

03:52.625 --> 03:55.000
-That's Melon Baby's formula.
-How does it look?

03:55.083 --> 03:58.583
It looks like your eyeball was marinating
in a public toilet.

03:59.291 --> 04:01.291
[adventurous music playing]

04:02.375 --> 04:04.750
[BTG] <i>The numbat had, thus far,</i>
<i>evaded our team,</i>

04:04.833 --> 04:07.666
<i>so we regrouped</i>
<i>and prepared to continue our search.</i>

04:07.750 --> 04:09.833
Your eye doesn't look so good.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.750
Well, yeah,
koala urine is teeming with bacteria.

04:12.833 --> 04:15.333
I probably have chlamydial conjunctivitis.

04:15.416 --> 04:16.416
Again.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.750
What do you mean, again?

04:17.833 --> 04:20.458
This isn't the first time
a koala peed in my eye, rookie.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.291
Come here, little buddy.
I'll keep you safe.

04:24.375 --> 04:25.666
-[urinating]
-[screaming]

04:26.708 --> 04:30.750
What are you doing in the water,
you dopey plush toy? There you go.

04:30.833 --> 04:32.333
-[urinating]
-[screaming]

04:32.416 --> 04:36.875
Only thing left is to check your underside
for any discolored discharge.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.083
Mm-hmm. Looks good.
You're in tip-top condition, little buddy.

04:40.166 --> 04:41.541
-[urinating]
-[screaming]

04:41.625 --> 04:43.625
Wait, when I'm a dad,

04:43.708 --> 04:46.333
will I have to let my human baby
pee in my eye?

04:46.416 --> 04:49.083
Dietrich, have you ever even seen a baby?

04:49.166 --> 04:50.750
Of course I have!

04:50.833 --> 04:54.083
Like a squishy neck pillow with eyes.
There's one now.

04:55.750 --> 04:57.291
[Bonnie] That's a quokka.

04:57.375 --> 05:00.708
Oh, I guess I should cancel
that Amber Alert.

05:00.791 --> 05:03.791
As a new father myself,
I understand your anxiety, Dietrich.

05:03.875 --> 05:04.875
I really do.

05:04.958 --> 05:08.041
Parents have to make
some pretty shocking sacrifices.

05:08.125 --> 05:10.708
Take those crab spiders
on your melon baby, for example.

05:10.791 --> 05:11.791
Crab what?

05:11.875 --> 05:13.250
When a crab spider gives birth,

05:13.333 --> 05:16.541
her babies hungrily slurp up
all her bodily fluids

05:16.625 --> 05:18.875
until she's
a hollowed-out husk. [chuckles]

05:18.958 --> 05:22.083
Whoa,
babies literally suck the life out of you.

05:22.166 --> 05:24.083
-Yep.
-So many spiders!

05:24.166 --> 05:26.416
Oh God! I feel them on my neck!

05:28.125 --> 05:31.000
[Bonnie] Oh, Margie's not gonna like that.

05:31.083 --> 05:32.958
Don't you dare tell Margie!

05:33.041 --> 05:35.375
I can't tell if this is funny or sad.

05:35.458 --> 05:36.916
Sometimes, it's both.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.291
Melon Baby! Come back!

05:40.791 --> 05:43.708
Oh, Melon Baby, you're safe now.

05:43.791 --> 05:45.291
-[BTG] Numbat!
-[chittering]

05:45.375 --> 05:46.958
-[yells]
-[Bonnie] Numbat!

05:47.041 --> 05:49.666
Hey! This log has a baby on board.

05:50.291 --> 05:51.750
[BTG grunting] So close.

05:51.833 --> 05:55.041
Dietrich, give Bonnie a hand up,
or we're all going into the drink.

05:56.666 --> 05:59.791
I can't!
I need to be a good father, for Margie.

05:59.875 --> 06:02.458
For who?
How long have you been in a relationship?

06:02.541 --> 06:05.291
Well, "relationship"
is such a loaded word.

06:05.375 --> 06:07.041
So, you just started dating?

06:07.125 --> 06:09.166
Well, it's not really dating.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.916
Technically, she's my dental hygienist.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.833
But she knows you like her, right?

06:13.916 --> 06:15.500
Uh, I think so.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.125
Most of the time,
she has her fingers in my mouth,

06:18.208 --> 06:19.500
so it's kind of hard to say.

06:19.583 --> 06:23.583
Come on, Dietrich. Real talk?
You're a single parent, at best.

06:23.666 --> 06:24.750
Leave me alone!

06:24.833 --> 06:27.041
Look, I realize
you wanna protect your baby.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.000
You're just like countless animal parents

06:29.083 --> 06:31.625
who do everything they can
to care for their young.

06:31.708 --> 06:33.458
Like the caecilian mother… Ow!

06:33.541 --> 06:38.250
…who lets her babies continually tear off
and eat her soft, protein-rich skin… Ahh!

06:38.333 --> 06:41.041
…in order to provide them
with key nutrients. Ahh!

06:41.125 --> 06:42.333
Eat up, little ones.

06:42.416 --> 06:44.208
I want you to grow big and strong,

06:44.291 --> 06:47.500
so one day you'll look
like the world's angriest penis.

06:47.583 --> 06:50.125
Or the platypus frog mother… [retches]

06:50.208 --> 06:54.250
…who swallows her eggs to protect them
inside her stomach… [retches]

06:54.333 --> 06:58.291
…where they hatch into tadpoles
and grow into frogs. [retches]

06:58.375 --> 07:01.833
This means she can't eat a single bite
for six whole weeks,

07:01.916 --> 07:06.541
and eventually, her expanding stomach
causes her lungs to collapse. [retches]

07:06.625 --> 07:08.041
Or like orca mothers,

07:08.125 --> 07:11.583
who must stay awake
for an entire month after giving birth,

07:11.666 --> 07:15.458
because their over-excited baby cannot
and will not go to sleep.

07:15.541 --> 07:16.916
-[yawning]
-[whalesong]

07:17.000 --> 07:19.541
If only a seagull
would get stuck in my blowhole

07:19.625 --> 07:22.333
so I could sink lifeless into the abyss.

07:22.416 --> 07:23.666
[whalesong]

07:24.875 --> 07:27.208
[laughing sheepishly]
Mommy's joking, darling!

07:27.291 --> 07:28.791
[laughs] Love you!

07:28.875 --> 07:30.458
But you see, Dietrich,

07:30.541 --> 07:34.000
the crucial difference
between those heroic parents and you

07:34.083 --> 07:36.458
is that your baby is a bloody watermelon!

07:36.541 --> 07:38.333
[gasps] Don't listen to him!

07:38.416 --> 07:42.791
[BTG] Help us up, or I will make you
give birth to that melon in reverse.

07:42.875 --> 07:44.416
Okay. Okay.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.833
-Oh, hold it.
-He's mocking us!

07:47.916 --> 07:50.375
-[BTG wailing] Numbat!
-[numbat chittering]

07:50.458 --> 07:51.458
[water splashing]

07:51.541 --> 07:54.666
-[BTG coughing]
-Tell Margie of my sacrifice!

07:54.750 --> 07:56.916
I have no idea who Margie is.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.666
Ah. You cheeky bugger. Numbat!

08:01.750 --> 08:05.916
[Bonnie] Waterfall!
If I drown, clear my browser history.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.625
[scoffs] Don't be silly, Bonnie.

08:07.708 --> 08:10.583
Very few people swept over waterfalls
die from drowning.

08:10.666 --> 08:14.416
No, no, no, they usually die
from smashing their skull on a rock.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.500
[both screaming]

08:17.458 --> 08:18.583
[rats squeaking]

08:19.416 --> 08:20.958
[gasps]

08:21.041 --> 08:22.166
[laughs]

08:22.250 --> 08:24.708
No softer landing
than a subterranean water cave.

08:25.375 --> 08:28.916
Oh, look! Rakali water-rats!
My favorite type of rat.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.833
Well, except Mafia informants.

08:33.291 --> 08:34.500
[coughing]

08:35.000 --> 08:36.458
-[grunting]
-[coughing]

08:36.541 --> 08:39.000
What the--
You coughed up an entire hot dog.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.500
I don't chew when I'm stressed.

08:41.541 --> 08:43.791
[yelps] Melon Baby! [laughs]

08:43.875 --> 08:46.000
You've been given a second chance at life!

08:46.083 --> 08:47.958
Don't make the same mistakes I did.

08:48.041 --> 08:51.166
Become an acrobat,
a linguist, or a coffee peddler.

08:51.250 --> 08:53.458
Anything but a field zoologist.

08:54.958 --> 08:56.208
[yelps]

08:56.291 --> 08:58.625
Ha! That's a dwarf bearded dragon lizard.

08:58.708 --> 09:01.208
Looks like he destroyed your melon
from the inside.

09:01.291 --> 09:04.083
-[laughing] You hate to see that.
-[sobbing]

09:05.666 --> 09:08.833
[gasps] Oh, hello! Aren't you friendly?

09:08.916 --> 09:11.708
So, when a dwarf bearded dragon lizard
waves at you,

09:11.791 --> 09:14.791
he's telling you he either wants to fight
or have sex.

09:14.875 --> 09:18.083
Oh, so basically a tech bro. Ew.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.875
[sobbing]

09:21.000 --> 09:25.833
A father should never have
to see his child eaten by a tiny lizard.

09:25.916 --> 09:28.500
Dietrich, come on!
Margie barely knows you.

09:28.583 --> 09:30.666
She's not gonna care
if you can't raise a watermelon.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.791
It's not even about Margie.

09:32.875 --> 09:35.208
It's just my mom raised me on her own.

09:35.291 --> 09:38.458
She always told me that, one day,
I would be a good father

09:38.541 --> 09:40.875
to… to make up for my useless dad,

09:41.666 --> 09:44.000
but now I'm a failure, too!

09:44.083 --> 09:49.208
Uncle B, you're a dad,
you speak parent gibberish.

09:49.291 --> 09:50.291
You got anything?

09:50.375 --> 09:51.958
There, there, Dietrich.

09:52.041 --> 09:53.958
Being a parent is really hard.

09:54.041 --> 09:57.416
Our baby daughter Genevieve
is the chubby ball of sunshine

09:57.500 --> 09:59.666
at the center
of our emotional solar system.

09:59.750 --> 10:02.000
Mm, my wife and I love her so much,

10:02.083 --> 10:05.541
and yet, being her parents
basically boils down to fatigue,

10:05.625 --> 10:07.916
terror and a lot of mystery stains.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.541
Mmm! So refreshing!

10:09.625 --> 10:10.708
And we have it easy.

10:10.791 --> 10:13.833
Out here,
parenthood is both extremely painful

10:13.916 --> 10:15.541
and downright perilous.

10:15.625 --> 10:16.833
Mmm. Mmm.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.625
That's good. You want some?

10:22.083 --> 10:24.875
Lions, cheetah, wild dogs, hyenas,

10:24.958 --> 10:27.500
they all follow
the great migration of wildebeest

10:27.583 --> 10:32.541
specifically looking for young animals
and pregnant mothers to pick off.

10:32.625 --> 10:36.833
Sometimes, a mother wildebeest's baby
will be eaten by lions

10:36.916 --> 10:38.541
while she gives birth to it.

10:38.625 --> 10:41.791
That's got to be
the worst birthing experience ever.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.583
-[cries]
-[sobbing] No!

10:45.708 --> 10:47.833
You actually thought
that story would help?

10:47.916 --> 10:52.333
What? I was just saying a baby in the wild
is basically a walking lunch special.

10:52.416 --> 10:54.041
This is terrible!

10:54.125 --> 10:56.125
Ugh! Just stop talking!

10:56.208 --> 10:57.958
Now, I don't wanna have kids either,

10:58.041 --> 11:00.541
unless I'm impregnated
by hot bisexual aliens

11:00.625 --> 11:02.166
at a pan-dimensional dance party.

11:02.250 --> 11:03.916
Ooh. Wow.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
-[sobbing] I'll never be a good father!
-Among other things.

11:08.083 --> 11:09.583
Don't be so hard on yourself.

11:09.666 --> 11:12.791
Just stay away from lions
and don't have any children.

11:12.875 --> 11:14.666
-You'll be fine.
-I guess you're right.

11:14.750 --> 11:17.583
If I can't be a good dad,
I should just give up.

11:17.666 --> 11:21.000
Okay, that went about as well
as I'd hoped. Good talk.

11:22.250 --> 11:25.083
-[rats squeaking]
-What-- Where are they going?

11:25.166 --> 11:26.666
I don't know.

11:26.750 --> 11:29.125
But if they think it's time to leave,
we're leaving.

11:29.208 --> 11:30.291
Follow those rats.

11:30.916 --> 11:32.291
[tense music playing]

11:34.041 --> 11:35.833
[rumbling]

11:37.833 --> 11:40.625
-[rocks rumbling]
-Oh! The cave's water broke!

11:40.708 --> 11:42.375
-[rumbling]
-[grunting]

11:42.458 --> 11:44.791
-Push!
-Push! Breathe!

11:44.875 --> 11:47.500
-Push!
-Push! You can do this!

11:47.583 --> 11:50.416
You are a beautiful warrior!

11:50.500 --> 11:52.041
-[Dietrich panting]
-[inhales]

11:53.125 --> 11:55.083
-Push! Push!
-Push!

11:55.166 --> 11:57.125
[grunting]

11:57.208 --> 11:58.375
[grunting]

12:03.500 --> 12:05.000
[water gushing]

12:09.458 --> 12:10.666
[exhales]

12:10.750 --> 12:12.583
I am reborn.

12:12.666 --> 12:15.791
Hmm. As far as births go,
that was surprisingly painless.

12:15.875 --> 12:18.750
Look at that! We landed in a school
of sand tiger sharks!

12:18.833 --> 12:21.541
Dietrich,
these guys will make you feel better.

12:26.041 --> 12:28.833
A sand tiger shark mother
might have seven eggs

12:28.916 --> 12:30.375
in each of her two wombs,

12:30.458 --> 12:32.125
but when the first one hatches,

12:32.208 --> 12:36.541
the baby shark will immediately kill
and eat all their brothers and sisters.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.250
And if two hatch at once,

12:38.333 --> 12:42.291
the shark babies will fight to the death
right inside their mother's body.

12:43.291 --> 12:46.375
See, Dietrich?
Just being born is a death sentence.

12:46.458 --> 12:48.666
So, you really didn't do too badly.

12:48.750 --> 12:49.750
Dietrich?

12:50.458 --> 12:53.875
Oh, I guess this was more
like a wild birth after all.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.166
-[grunting]
-Dietrich! Wake up!

12:57.250 --> 13:00.541
-Come on!
-You're too young to die!

13:01.125 --> 13:02.958
Wait, how old is Dietrich?

13:03.041 --> 13:04.708
I don't know, like 38ish?

13:04.791 --> 13:07.291
For a field zoologist,
that's actually pretty good.

13:07.375 --> 13:10.291
Regardless of statistical death rates
for your profession,

13:10.375 --> 13:11.500
you should still live!

13:11.583 --> 13:14.000
-Live, damn you!
-Come on, D! Come back to us!

13:14.083 --> 13:17.916
I'll never make fun of you again!
Well, I'll make fun of you slightly less.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.083
Ugh! Damn you!

13:19.166 --> 13:21.583
Do what you do best. Run away from death!

13:21.666 --> 13:24.458
Wake up, Dietrich! You can't die!

13:24.541 --> 13:25.583
Ugh!

13:27.333 --> 13:28.583
I think he's gone.

13:30.541 --> 13:34.583
Dietrich was a timid field zoologist
for ten years

13:34.666 --> 13:38.583
and very briefly,
a devoted father to a small melon

13:38.666 --> 13:41.208
with a truly startling face.

13:41.291 --> 13:44.750
And then, yes, yes,
and now let the sea reclaim him,

13:44.833 --> 13:50.375
for this is where life was born
3.5 billion years ago and, uh…

13:50.458 --> 13:52.416
Oh! Sting! Sting away, jellyfish!

13:52.500 --> 13:54.458
Lay your seed in his… pores?

13:54.541 --> 13:56.708
Uh, consume his, um, marrow.

13:56.791 --> 13:59.500
His body now belongs to the sea.
Okay, we're good.

13:59.583 --> 14:02.000
He would have screamed so much about this.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.458
Ahh! Jellyfish!

14:05.541 --> 14:06.791
[coughing]

14:07.666 --> 14:08.666
I'm fine.

14:08.750 --> 14:12.375
-[laughs]
-Oh! Dietrich! You beautiful coward!

14:12.458 --> 14:15.166
You were fine. You were so fine!

14:15.250 --> 14:17.708
Those juvenile jellyfish stings
restarted your heart.

14:17.791 --> 14:19.041
It's a miracle!

14:19.125 --> 14:21.916
As a man of science,
I do not throw that word around lightly.

14:22.000 --> 14:22.958
What happened?

14:23.041 --> 14:25.208
-Did I die?
-Ha! Only briefly.

14:25.291 --> 14:27.541
I saw Melon Baby, on the other side.

14:28.791 --> 14:29.916
<i>He was whole again.</i>

14:30.416 --> 14:33.416
<i>Rolling through green fields</i>
<i>with other melons.</i> [chuckles]

14:33.500 --> 14:35.458
He said it was time for me to let go,

14:36.083 --> 14:38.500
and that I should get a body piercing
to remember him.

14:38.583 --> 14:41.333
Right. Well, good to have you back
with us, old friend.

14:41.416 --> 14:42.791
I'm your old friend?

14:42.875 --> 14:45.000
-Mm-hmm. Sure.
-Wow.

14:45.083 --> 14:46.833
You know, I've been meaning to say

14:46.916 --> 14:49.333
how grateful I am
for the way you guys value me--

14:49.416 --> 14:50.583
Numbat.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.458
-Let's do this.
-[chittering]

14:54.666 --> 14:55.666
It's okay.

14:55.750 --> 14:57.916
I'll write the rest
in my gratitude journal.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.291
Goodbye, Melon Baby.

15:01.875 --> 15:04.250
I'll never forget your beautiful smile.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.083
[gasps] Wait for me!

15:07.166 --> 15:08.666
Slow down, you ginger whippet!

15:08.750 --> 15:10.583
We're trying to save your species!

15:10.666 --> 15:13.041
Agh! Come on! Ow!

15:13.125 --> 15:14.291
[chittering]

15:15.083 --> 15:17.916
[grunts] Whoa!

15:18.458 --> 15:20.208
Ooh. Nipple-lash.

15:20.291 --> 15:22.750
You know, maybe motherhood's not for you.

15:22.833 --> 15:25.083
-Fair point.
-Hang on, I'll untie you.

15:25.791 --> 15:26.666
Bonnie, hurry!

15:26.750 --> 15:28.125
[panting]

15:28.208 --> 15:30.250
[BTG] Look! He has relaxed his peduncle

15:30.333 --> 15:33.041
to lower his scrotum
in order to cool his testicles,

15:33.125 --> 15:35.458
and that means he is hot
and possibly tired.

15:35.541 --> 15:37.375
-Now is our chance.
-Ha!

15:37.458 --> 15:41.250
You put the "uncle" in "peduncle,"
Uncle B.

15:41.333 --> 15:42.875
Never ever say that again.

15:43.833 --> 15:44.916
[grunts]

15:45.500 --> 15:48.208
I'm doing this for Melon Baby!

15:48.291 --> 15:49.833
[grunting]

15:50.708 --> 15:53.458
Hollow logs feel so empty without you,
Melon Baby.

15:54.541 --> 15:57.041
Dietrich, don't move.

15:57.125 --> 16:00.750
Where there are termites,
there's a numbat feast waiting to happen.

16:01.375 --> 16:02.458
[chittering]

16:05.208 --> 16:06.208
Success!

16:06.291 --> 16:09.416
Great job, Dietrich!
You're a numbat whisperer.

16:09.500 --> 16:12.583
Hey, little guy! Will you be my baby?

16:12.666 --> 16:14.250
-[squirts]
-Yah!

16:14.333 --> 16:15.750
Babies are gross.

16:15.833 --> 16:17.375
[BTG] This is home, Stripes.

16:17.458 --> 16:19.916
Just do your best
to be a good numbat dad, okay?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.500
Put that peduncle to work.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.166
As soon as your babies are strong enough,

16:23.250 --> 16:25.958
we'll be back to take you all home
to the wild, okay?

16:26.041 --> 16:27.125
[blowing raspberry]

16:27.750 --> 16:29.708
What are you gonna tell Margie
about Melon Baby?

16:29.791 --> 16:31.625
<i>I'll just go to a different dentist.</i>

16:31.708 --> 16:33.166
<i>Yeah, sounds easier.</i>

16:33.875 --> 16:35.000
<i>Who's Margie again?</i>

16:37.625 --> 16:40.500
It's dry, but oil-rich
and highly flammable.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.500
[Bonnie] Yeah, no, you look amazing.

16:42.583 --> 16:47.500
Your beautiful pear-shaped body
is just, like, looking better than ever.

16:47.583 --> 16:48.875
-Thank you.
-Your eyelashes--

16:48.958 --> 16:51.583
-I was talking to Piper.
-[BTG] Oh, she does look good.

16:51.666 --> 16:54.291
-She looks amazing right now.
-[BTG] She looks great.

16:54.375 --> 16:55.958
And her pregnancy is on track.

16:56.041 --> 16:58.041
Pinky has migrated its way into the pouch.

16:58.125 --> 17:01.791
It effectively gestates outside the body,

17:01.875 --> 17:07.000
but the flip side is now you have
this incredibly heavy infant

17:07.083 --> 17:10.875
swinging around in the pouch,
which has to stretch to accommodate it.

17:10.958 --> 17:13.041
It makes it very difficult
to move swiftly,

17:13.125 --> 17:15.291
which means a lot of predators
would love to eat her.

17:15.375 --> 17:16.625
You're scaring her.

17:16.708 --> 17:19.166
Let me walk it back
by telling you about marsupial sex.

17:19.250 --> 17:20.458
It's quite extraordinary.

17:20.541 --> 17:22.541
-The baby is--
-No, no, that is enough.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.916
Piper, don't even pay attention to him.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
[groovy music playing]
