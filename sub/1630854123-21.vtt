They said she was clawing

40:40.970 --> 40:45.510
at the inside
of that toy chest,

40:45.710 --> 40:50.170
like it was a coffin.

40:50.370 --> 40:53.450
She just needed
someone to help.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.790
Maybe you tried.

40:58.990 --> 41:02.220
I don't know.

41:02.420 --> 41:05.140
But you people had a chance

41:05.340 --> 41:08.320
to find my daughter

41:08.520 --> 41:11.540
three days ago

41:11.740 --> 41:15.370
when I told you
she was missing,

41:15.570 --> 41:18.280
but no one lifted a finger

41:18.480 --> 41:22.940
till a senator's kid was taken.

41:23.140 --> 41:26.160
That's not right.

41:26.360 --> 41:29.730
It is not OK.

41:29.930 --> 41:33.600
- We are very sorry
for your loss.

41:33.800 --> 41:38.040
- Sorry doesn't mean
a damn thing

41:38.240 --> 41:40.490
or make my daughter not dead.

41:45.320 --> 41:47.710
So please just go.

41:47.900 --> 41:51.230
- Mrs. Ryan--
- Get the hell out of here.
