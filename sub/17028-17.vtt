WEBVTT

00:03.325 --> 00:04.528
Last check Earl.

00:04.529 --> 00:07.225
And my boyfriend Bobby
will be here soon.

00:07.226 --> 00:08.927
He's sleeping over again.

00:08.928 --> 00:10.695
My boyfriend, Bobby, I mean.

00:10.696 --> 00:13.532
You know that cute guy
Bobby, my boyfriend?

00:13.533 --> 00:16.234
Oh, I know your boyfriend Bobby.

00:16.235 --> 00:20.305
You name-drop him like
you're Gayle and he's Oprah.

00:20.306 --> 00:22.374
Why don't you ever stay at Bobby's?

00:22.375 --> 00:24.242
His place can't be worse than ours.

00:24.243 --> 00:26.945
Unless he's what's living in our wall.

00:26.946 --> 00:29.981
No, that's definitely a
woman sobbing in there.

00:29.982 --> 00:31.450
And I can't stay at Bobby's

00:31.451 --> 00:33.318
'cause he lives at home with his family.

00:33.319 --> 00:34.786
I didn't know Bobby lived at home.

00:34.787 --> 00:36.488
Wish I could move back home.

00:36.489 --> 00:38.255
They don't make Pontiacs anymore.

00:39.758 --> 00:41.893
The famous Bobby lives at home?

00:41.894 --> 00:44.830
Sounds like you landed a real winner.

00:44.831 --> 00:47.265
Actually, Han, Bobby
only moved back home

00:47.266 --> 00:49.734
because his dad died last year.

00:49.735 --> 00:53.405
H-E-double hockey sticks!

00:53.406 --> 00:55.807
The one guy I take a shot at, ever,

00:55.808 --> 00:58.810
and he's the freakin' Orphan Annie!

01:10.021 --> 01:11.523
Hey, I'm Bobby.

01:11.524 --> 01:13.458
I'm looking for my girlfriend Caroline.

01:13.459 --> 01:15.427
You know that cute girl, Caroline?

01:15.428 --> 01:17.696
My girlfriend.

01:17.697 --> 01:21.298
Bobby. Now, where have
I heard that name before?

01:22.634 --> 01:26.271
Bobby, my boyfriend, stop.

01:26.272 --> 01:27.939
Hey, before I forget.

01:27.940 --> 01:29.674
My mom is throwing a party tomorrow...

01:29.675 --> 01:31.242
- Shhh!
- Are you crazy?

01:33.879 --> 01:37.682
Bobby, never discuss
a party in the diner.

01:37.683 --> 01:39.518
If the people we work with,

01:39.519 --> 01:43.989
and I'm using "people" in
the loosest sense possible...

01:43.990 --> 01:48.759
if they hear about a
party, they'll come to it!

01:50.128 --> 01:52.230
We had to learn Navajo

01:52.231 --> 01:54.166
just so we could talk
about our weekend plans

01:54.167 --> 01:56.034
without them overhearing.

01:56.035 --> 01:59.037
And then they learned Navajo.

01:59.038 --> 02:03.308
Now it makes sense that Earl
asked me for wampum yesterday.

02:03.309 --> 02:07.012
Okay, so my mom is throwing
this party at our house tomorrow.

02:07.013 --> 02:08.413
You want to meet my family?

02:08.413 --> 02:11.048
I'd love to meet them!

02:12.817 --> 02:14.486
Especially your mom.

02:14.487 --> 02:17.656
It goes without saying,
but she's gonna love me.

02:17.657 --> 02:21.526
Why? Does she love people who
spit a little when they talk?

02:21.527 --> 02:22.994
I don't spit when I talk.

02:22.995 --> 02:25.363
Nope, I saw it that time.

02:25.364 --> 02:26.398
But that's okay.

02:26.399 --> 02:27.832
Moms love me almost as much

02:27.833 --> 02:30.168
as truckers love Max.

02:30.169 --> 02:33.705
You model for one mud
flap, you're made for life.

02:33.706 --> 02:35.073
You're coming too, right, Max?

02:35.074 --> 02:36.575
My whole family's gonna be there.

02:36.576 --> 02:38.359
Caroline's whole family
should be there, too.

02:38.360 --> 02:41.379
Aww, that's so sweet.

02:41.380 --> 02:42.948
Sounds good.

02:42.949 --> 02:45.983
What time should I bring
the sacrificial raccoon?

02:47.686 --> 02:51.223
Oh, is it not a birthday?

02:51.224 --> 02:53.725
You could hear from back there?

02:53.726 --> 02:56.861
And through the wall in my office.

02:56.862 --> 02:58.897
Can't wait for the party.

02:58.898 --> 03:00.966
Can I bring a Jell-O dessert?

03:00.967 --> 03:03.568
I have a new Pikachu mold
I've been dying to try out.

03:03.569 --> 03:07.439
Is it the same Pikachu
mold that you came out of?

03:07.440 --> 03:11.109
Ah, so, about this party
we're all invited to,

03:11.110 --> 03:14.445
is it open bar, or do we have
to go through the cabinets again?

03:21.679 --> 03:24.068
So what kind of perfume
does your mom wear?

03:24.069 --> 03:25.452
I need to know for when I tell her

03:25.453 --> 03:26.537
I've always loved it

03:26.538 --> 03:28.339
and can't believe she wears it too.

03:28.340 --> 03:30.240
I don't know, but please don't wear it

03:30.241 --> 03:32.109
if you ever want to
have sex with me again.

03:34.179 --> 03:36.513
Oh, uh, one more thing.

03:36.514 --> 03:38.449
Don't tell her that I
spent the night here.

03:38.450 --> 03:40.217
She thinks I stayed
at my friend Brian's.

03:40.218 --> 03:41.518
She's kind of old-fashioned.

03:41.519 --> 03:43.187
Can't be that old-fashioned.

03:43.188 --> 03:46.223
She's cool with you sleeping
with your friend Brian.

03:46.224 --> 03:47.591
All right, I'll see you later.

03:47.592 --> 03:49.375
I got to go help my mom
set up for the party.

03:49.376 --> 03:51.695
Uh, if I'm coming off
as too much of a bad boy,

03:51.696 --> 03:52.930
I can tone it down.

03:59.303 --> 04:02.105
I'll be sure to do cheek
kisses at your house.

04:08.445 --> 04:11.048
So!

04:11.049 --> 04:12.552
Is there gonna be weed at this party,

04:12.553 --> 04:14.752
or can I make some money selling?

04:14.753 --> 04:16.320
Max, it is really important to me

04:16.321 --> 04:17.654
that Bobby's mom likes me,

04:17.654 --> 04:19.990
which is why I hid your weed

04:19.991 --> 04:22.926
and bought her a lovely gift to bring.

04:22.927 --> 04:26.597
In lieu of gifts, I always
just wear a low-cut shirt.

04:26.598 --> 04:28.498
But I see why you had to buy something.

04:29.767 --> 04:32.836
Look. Macaron.

04:34.239 --> 04:36.774
Uh, you're maca-wrong,

04:36.775 --> 04:38.942
'cause those are macaroons.

04:38.943 --> 04:40.511
And I think I maca-ruined them

04:40.512 --> 04:42.232
when I ate the filling out of 'em.

04:43.814 --> 04:50.254
Wait, you're going to Bobby's
mom's party dressed like that?

04:50.255 --> 04:54.458
Are you aware your husband
is dressed for a canoe trip?

04:54.459 --> 04:56.093
I Google Earth-ed the house.

04:56.094 --> 04:58.162
There's a pool at the house next door.

04:58.163 --> 05:01.999
And a short fence.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.435
Actually, the party was canceled.

05:04.436 --> 05:06.103
I'm so sorry.

05:06.104 --> 05:07.704
You'll have to meet Bobby's family

05:07.705 --> 05:09.473
sometime never on.

05:09.474 --> 05:11.442
Yep, party canceled.

05:11.443 --> 05:13.010
There was a sinkhole.

05:13.011 --> 05:14.678
Uh, still haven't found the house.

05:14.679 --> 05:16.613
Everyone's dead.

05:16.614 --> 05:18.649
That's horrible.

05:18.650 --> 05:21.485
I pre-paid a sitter.

05:21.486 --> 05:24.688
Oh, I guess we'll just
hang out here then.

05:24.689 --> 05:26.457
And since there's no pool...

05:26.458 --> 05:28.292
Ahh! Okay! Okay, fine!

05:28.293 --> 05:30.116
The party's not canceled.
There's no sinkhole.

05:30.117 --> 05:32.062
No one's dead. Come at 4:00.

05:32.063 --> 05:34.798
Just please don't embarrass me.

05:34.799 --> 05:38.334
Uh, I think that was
directed at you, Max.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.839
Awkward.

05:48.645 --> 05:50.380
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:50.381 --> 05:52.204
We're here early, 'cause
moms love promptness,

05:52.205 --> 05:55.886
and our Uber driver was on the
front end of a police chase.

05:55.887 --> 05:58.489
You're gonna nail it. My
mom's favorite show's "Cops."

05:58.490 --> 06:00.723
Oh, I'm a series regular.

06:02.192 --> 06:03.760
Oh, nice staircase.

06:03.761 --> 06:05.829
You get along with the
folks that live up there?

06:05.830 --> 06:07.664
Uh, sometimes.

06:07.665 --> 06:09.733
Depends how my sisters are feeling,

06:09.734 --> 06:11.317
'cause that is still part of the house.

06:15.172 --> 06:16.707
Wow!

06:16.708 --> 06:18.509
You didn't tell us
you lived in a castle.

06:18.510 --> 06:21.411
Look at the TV and chairs!

06:21.412 --> 06:22.846
You guys must've gotten this stuff

06:22.847 --> 06:25.616
right after they laid
it out on the curb.

06:25.617 --> 06:29.286
Bobby, I found the program
from your sixth grade play.

06:29.287 --> 06:31.288
You were so good.

06:31.289 --> 06:33.223
Like Leonardo DiCaprio.

06:33.224 --> 06:34.458
Only not bloated.

06:36.027 --> 06:39.229
Ma, I played a tree,
and I still got booed.

06:39.230 --> 06:40.597
Sorry, she likes to brag about me.

06:40.598 --> 06:41.865
This is my mom.

06:41.866 --> 06:43.567
Hi, Bobby's mom. I'm Max.

06:43.568 --> 06:45.736
May I say you have a beautiful house?

06:45.737 --> 06:49.706
And that's high praise,
'cause I've been in five.

06:49.707 --> 06:51.108
And I'm Caroline.

06:51.109 --> 06:52.576
Oh, that scent you're wearing

06:52.577 --> 06:54.077
is my all-time favorite.

06:54.078 --> 06:55.611
I sat on a deviled egg.

06:57.648 --> 07:00.617
I hope you like macaron.

07:00.618 --> 07:02.618
You don't think I have enough food?

07:05.155 --> 07:08.659
I know this sounds insane,

07:08.660 --> 07:12.496
but I don't know if
she love-love-loved me.

07:12.497 --> 07:14.631
Don't worry... she takes
a little time to warm up,

07:14.632 --> 07:15.999
but when she does,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.502
you'll only notice a little difference.

07:18.503 --> 07:21.638
Uh, Bobby... question.

07:21.639 --> 07:25.841
How did you get Queen Elizabeth
to sell you her throne?

07:28.579 --> 07:31.481
Bobby, you only invited girls?

07:31.482 --> 07:34.251
You knew I wanted a sausage-fest.

07:34.252 --> 07:36.253
I did bring macaron.

07:36.254 --> 07:38.488
You must be Bobby's sister, Denise.

07:38.489 --> 07:40.123
I'm Caroline.

07:40.124 --> 07:44.628
I'm Max, and I should
have worn a diaper here.

07:44.629 --> 07:47.764
Seriously, Bobby, if you
never invite any guys over,

07:47.765 --> 07:48.865
how am I gonna find one?

07:48.866 --> 07:50.467
Ma cancelled my Match.com account.

07:50.468 --> 07:52.803
I'm not paying $9.99 a month

07:52.804 --> 07:54.972
for you to be a slut!

07:54.973 --> 07:57.808
Ma! Stay out of my business!

07:57.809 --> 08:00.944
You treat me like I'm still in my 30s!

08:00.945 --> 08:03.280
Well, if there aren't
gonna be any guys here,

08:03.281 --> 08:05.748
I'm gonna go smoke a J and do my jigsaw.

08:07.784 --> 08:11.021
Definitely popping by
Denise's room later.

08:11.022 --> 08:12.823
Bobby, I can't explain it,

08:12.824 --> 08:15.826
but somehow, when you stock
the Tab in the garage fridge,

08:15.827 --> 08:17.294
it just tastes better.

08:17.295 --> 08:18.829
Garage fridge?

08:18.830 --> 08:20.864
How rich are you people?

08:20.865 --> 08:23.200
You know who loved an ice-cold Tab?

08:23.201 --> 08:24.968
Jessica.

08:24.969 --> 08:26.403
Ma! Really?

08:26.404 --> 08:29.006
I specifically asked you
not to bring up Jessica.

08:29.007 --> 08:31.408
Oops.

08:31.409 --> 08:32.743
Who's Jessica?

08:32.744 --> 08:34.077
She's my ex.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.912
We stopped dating over a year ago.

08:35.913 --> 08:37.179
Dating?

08:37.181 --> 08:39.750
You were engaged to be engaged!

08:39.751 --> 08:42.852
I'm sitting, but I'm lying down.

08:46.890 --> 08:48.859
She was the only girl I ever thought

08:48.860 --> 08:50.661
was good enough for my Bobby.

08:50.662 --> 08:52.396
No offense, hon, but look at her.

08:52.397 --> 08:55.866
With that face, she could've
been a dental hygienist.

08:55.867 --> 08:57.501
She's on your wall?

08:57.502 --> 09:00.837
Only to cover a hole that
Denise punched in it...

09:00.838 --> 09:02.506
when I broke up with Jessica.

09:02.507 --> 09:04.908
Did someone say Jessica?

09:04.909 --> 09:06.677
Who is that?

09:06.678 --> 09:08.245
And please don't say Jessica.

09:08.246 --> 09:10.347
That... that's my other sister, Chrissy.

09:10.348 --> 09:12.215
She doesn't come out
of her room these days.

09:12.216 --> 09:15.252
- She's still in mourning.
- Oh, over your dad?

09:15.253 --> 09:16.953
Over Jessica.

09:16.954 --> 09:19.022
She hasn't come out of her
room since they broke up.

09:19.023 --> 09:22.925
And she was this close to
assistant manager at TCBY.

09:26.430 --> 09:29.165
I'm over Jessica. My family less so.

09:31.568 --> 09:35.038
Oh, my God!

09:35.039 --> 09:37.907
This chair has another
chair just for your feet!

09:43.246 --> 09:45.649
Bobby, why didn't you
tell me about Jessica?

09:45.650 --> 09:49.152
I told you about my
father being in prison.

09:49.153 --> 09:51.088
No, you didn't.

09:51.089 --> 09:53.957
My father's in prison.

09:53.958 --> 09:56.059
Jessica's not important to me.

09:56.060 --> 09:58.929
I think about her so little,
she might as well be AOL.

09:58.930 --> 10:01.064
I'm on AOL.

10:01.065 --> 10:03.433
Oh, my God, we know
nothing about each other.

10:03.434 --> 10:06.770
Bobby, did you stock
the kitchen fridge, too?

10:06.771 --> 10:08.871
'Cause I'm getting that
crisp, clean, bottle taste

10:08.872 --> 10:10.073
from a can here.

10:10.074 --> 10:13.110
I took my shoes off. Hope that's okay.

10:13.111 --> 10:15.979
Bobby, stop standing
there staring at Jessica.

10:15.980 --> 10:17.514
Give someone else a turn.

10:17.515 --> 10:19.182
I'm doing a load.

10:19.183 --> 10:20.883
Go up to your room and get your dirties.

10:22.586 --> 10:24.020
I... I have to give 'em to her.

10:24.021 --> 10:25.662
Otherwise she's gonna
go through my stuff,

10:25.663 --> 10:27.046
and I have a check from my grandpa

10:27.047 --> 10:29.526
I don't want her to know about.

10:29.527 --> 10:31.527
Chrissy! I'm doing a wash!

10:34.464 --> 10:37.634
And fold everything in
threes this time, Ma!

10:37.635 --> 10:40.137
The way Jessica used to!

10:40.138 --> 10:42.539
I'll try, but I'm not perfect.

10:42.540 --> 10:44.708
That was Jessica's thing.

10:44.709 --> 10:46.276
Got that right, Ma!

10:46.277 --> 10:50.013
The woman was without flaws!

10:51.783 --> 10:53.483
You might want to wash that alone.

10:53.484 --> 10:56.186
Believe it or not, it's a white.

10:56.187 --> 10:58.021
Max, what are you doing?

10:58.022 --> 10:59.489
Relax, I have the other one on.

10:59.490 --> 11:00.891
No one's gonna get hurt.

11:00.892 --> 11:02.559
I just need to stay calm

11:02.560 --> 11:05.061
and figure out a way to
win Bobby's mother over.

11:05.062 --> 11:06.730
I have to! I have to!

11:06.731 --> 11:08.698
You trying to get some
of that sweet, sweet

11:08.699 --> 11:09.699
grandpa-check money?

11:11.202 --> 11:13.837
Somebody get the frickin' door!

11:13.838 --> 11:15.872
Uh, I'll get the frickin' door.

11:15.873 --> 11:16.973
No, no, no, no, no.

11:16.974 --> 11:18.675
I have to win these people over.

11:18.676 --> 11:20.843
I freaking got it, Chrissy.

11:25.382 --> 11:26.849
Oh, great. This should help.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.074

11:38.689 --> 11:40.457
Earl's got five more
minutes in that chair.

11:40.458 --> 11:42.459
I'll bounce an old man.

11:42.460 --> 11:45.795
Whose turn is it to
see if he's breathing?

11:45.796 --> 11:48.465
Oh, no, he's okay.

11:48.466 --> 11:50.901
He's just having a running dream.

11:50.902 --> 11:53.803
You'll get that squirrel, buddy.

11:53.804 --> 11:55.805
Well, clock's ticking.

11:55.806 --> 11:57.607
Look, elephant in the room,

11:57.608 --> 12:00.911
but I got to see what porno
looks like on that screen.

12:00.912 --> 12:02.445
Oh, yeah, look.

12:02.446 --> 12:06.416
I brought "Manchester
by the Double D's."

12:06.417 --> 12:08.318
You see why we had to learn Navajo?

12:08.319 --> 12:10.987
It's all fine. My mother
loves having company.

12:10.988 --> 12:14.157
Oh, not kidding; they're
really going to watch it

12:14.158 --> 12:16.092
It doesn't fit.

12:16.093 --> 12:18.995
Heh, if I had a nickel for
every time I've said that.

12:18.996 --> 12:21.497
Yeah, he's got that right.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.136
Bobby, I told you.

12:26.137 --> 12:27.600
You can't leave the front door open.

12:27.601 --> 12:29.639
We live too close to the YMCA.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.108
No, Ma, these are Caroline's friends.

12:32.109 --> 12:33.843
They speak Navajo.

12:33.844 --> 12:36.346
Okay, well, I hope they like Italian,

12:36.347 --> 12:38.847
'cause that's what I
spent all night making.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.450
You know, I... I think she's warming up.

12:45.655 --> 12:49.125
You see I'm dealing with a
perfect ex-girlfriend situation.

12:49.126 --> 12:51.027
I need you to be on my side.

12:51.028 --> 12:52.762
Fine.

12:52.763 --> 12:55.131
I don't think Jessica made
people take sides, just FYI.

12:55.132 --> 12:56.499
Yeah, I think it's time for me

12:56.500 --> 12:58.368
to switch my focus
from the mom to Denise.

12:58.369 --> 13:01.004
I forgot, I'm actually
better with sisters.

13:01.005 --> 13:02.939
I have to be! I have to be!

13:02.940 --> 13:04.841
Well, you better be.

13:04.842 --> 13:06.442
'Cause I'm gonna tell you the same thing

13:06.466 --> 13:08.111
I told my old boyfriend,
Missionary Steve:

13:08.112 --> 13:10.079
it's time to turn this thing around.

13:11.314 --> 13:13.016
Denise, there you are!

13:13.017 --> 13:15.819
Oh, look at you. I love
a midday costume change.

13:15.820 --> 13:19.789
And you said I couldn't wear
my eating robe to the party.

13:19.790 --> 13:22.158
Well, since there aren't
gonna be any guys here,

13:22.159 --> 13:24.661
I figured I'd just get ready for bed.

13:24.662 --> 13:29.064
Ooh, who's the hottie over there?

13:30.500 --> 13:32.302
The one running in his sleep

13:32.303 --> 13:36.206
or the one fanning his
underarms with a plate?

13:36.207 --> 13:38.375
The muscular one.

13:38.376 --> 13:41.144
Muscular? You're gonna have to point.

13:41.145 --> 13:43.880
Is there a different "over there"?

13:43.881 --> 13:45.682
Come on, guys, in the dining room.

13:45.683 --> 13:47.717
You have to taste the sauce I made.

13:47.718 --> 13:50.053
I used Jessica's recipe.

13:50.054 --> 13:52.222
It's a frickin' delight!

13:52.223 --> 13:53.890
Watch your mouth, young lady!

13:53.891 --> 13:55.290
But she's right.

13:59.496 --> 14:00.762
Hello.

14:09.273 --> 14:10.907
Before we start eating,

14:10.908 --> 14:13.208
Max, would you like to say grace?

14:15.612 --> 14:17.446
Thanks, God?

14:19.849 --> 14:22.685
I'll do it.

14:22.686 --> 14:24.587
We thank God and his mother,

14:24.588 --> 14:26.556
'cause we know his
mother does everything.

14:26.557 --> 14:29.192
And he would never date a woman
without getting her approval.

14:29.193 --> 14:33.096
Okay, Ma, I don't think
Jesus was a big dater.

14:33.097 --> 14:35.732
He wasn't when I knew him.

14:35.733 --> 14:38.034
Han, I need you to flirt with Denise.

14:38.035 --> 14:39.869
- She likes you.
- I got that.

14:39.870 --> 14:41.604
Her hand is on my knee.

14:41.605 --> 14:43.572
Oop, not my knee anymore.

14:45.075 --> 14:48.378
Excuse my reach.

14:48.379 --> 14:51.081
You like them? I got 'em for Christmas.

14:51.082 --> 14:52.549
We all chipped in.

14:52.550 --> 14:55.485
Jessica worked very
closely with the doctor

14:55.486 --> 14:58.955
to design the shape
texture of the nipples.

14:58.956 --> 15:00.924
I got her a calendar.

15:00.925 --> 15:03.059
I don't know who Jessica is,

15:03.060 --> 15:05.328
but I need the sauce recipe.

15:05.329 --> 15:07.063
And my lovely wife and I

15:07.064 --> 15:10.433
wouldn't mind seeing those
nipples at some point.

15:10.434 --> 15:13.670
Well, there's no way they're
as good as this sauce.

15:13.671 --> 15:15.071
Mmm, mm-mm.

15:15.072 --> 15:17.574
Anyway, Caroline owns a dessert bar.

15:17.575 --> 15:20.143
What the hell is that?

15:20.144 --> 15:21.644
Max, what do you think of the sauce?

15:21.645 --> 15:24.981
Max, you can be honest
if you don't love it.

15:24.982 --> 15:28.184
What? More.

15:28.185 --> 15:30.320
- Mmm, mmm.
- Okay, we get it.

15:30.321 --> 15:31.821
You like Jessica's sauce.

15:31.822 --> 15:34.791
Mmm, you know, I'm so full,

15:34.792 --> 15:36.960
but I can't stop.

15:36.961 --> 15:38.495
You don't have to eat it.

15:38.496 --> 15:40.163
Are you crazy?

15:40.164 --> 15:44.467
This is a once in a lifetime sauce.

15:44.468 --> 15:48.438
I'm gonna push my Spanx to the limit.

15:48.439 --> 15:49.862
Could someone switch seats with me?

15:49.863 --> 15:51.374
What's going on over there, Denise?

15:51.375 --> 15:52.798
You keeping your hands to yourself?

15:52.799 --> 15:55.979
Uh, I'll sit next to her.

15:55.980 --> 15:57.881
I'd like to move down
and sit next to Caroline.

15:57.882 --> 15:59.985
Oh, so now you don't want
to sit next to your mother?

15:59.986 --> 16:02.218
I'm not hungry anyway.

16:02.219 --> 16:07.023
I'm gonna go upstairs and take a shower.

16:07.024 --> 16:09.959
There's a big hole
in our shower curtain.

16:09.960 --> 16:13.897
Thanks, but I use a
doctor-prescribed soap.

16:13.898 --> 16:15.565
Thanks a lot, Han.

16:15.566 --> 16:18.034
You couldn't just take
a shower with her for me?

16:18.035 --> 16:20.336
Ma! Where's my plate?

16:20.337 --> 16:22.739
Could somebody take
a plate up to Chrissy?

16:22.740 --> 16:24.908
She's still too upset to come out.

16:24.909 --> 16:27.043
- You know, because of...
- We know, Ma.

16:27.044 --> 16:28.645
I'll do it.

16:28.646 --> 16:30.309
'Cause I... I don't
even like this sauce.

16:31.815 --> 16:34.350
No, I'll... I'll bring
Chrissy her plate.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.053
She's my last chance.

16:37.054 --> 16:38.555
And save me some of that sauce.

16:38.556 --> 16:40.156
It's the best thing I've ever had.

16:40.157 --> 16:42.457
Don't worry, I filled
your purse with it.

16:45.495 --> 16:47.664
Does anyone work here?

16:47.665 --> 16:48.930
Where's my food?

16:51.701 --> 16:53.670
Well, well, well, Jessica.

16:53.671 --> 16:55.171
You may make a great sauce,

16:55.172 --> 16:57.273
but you can't stop me.

17:00.276 --> 17:01.744
What's going on out there?

17:01.745 --> 17:02.845
I heard a crash!

17:02.846 --> 17:04.847
Uh, everything's fine!

17:04.848 --> 17:06.749
A truck hit a kid outside.

17:06.750 --> 17:09.519
Max, can you come here for a second?

17:09.520 --> 17:11.119
What's all the commotion?

17:11.121 --> 17:12.789
I can't eat my frickin' feelings

17:12.790 --> 17:15.090
if there's no food!

17:15.092 --> 17:16.726
Was the kid on a bike?

17:16.727 --> 17:21.130
Oh, my God! Look what
you did to Jessica!

17:21.131 --> 17:23.566
Why are you so jealous of her, Caroline?

17:23.567 --> 17:25.768
You'll never be Jessica,
okay? None of us will!

17:25.769 --> 17:27.403
I didn't do it!

17:27.404 --> 17:29.038
She just fell off the wall.

17:29.039 --> 17:31.441
Max, she is trying to destroy me.

17:31.442 --> 17:32.976
Where's my food?

17:32.977 --> 17:35.645
I'm starting to scratch my arms again!

17:35.646 --> 17:37.280
Okay, I'll fix the picture.

17:37.281 --> 17:38.281
Give her my plate.

17:38.282 --> 17:40.049
Hang on.

17:40.050 --> 17:42.218
Let me just take one more big bite.

17:42.219 --> 17:45.088
Give me a little of that.

17:45.089 --> 17:47.622
Oh, damn you, Jessica!

17:57.914 --> 17:59.983
Max, how did you fix Jessica's picture?

17:59.984 --> 18:01.484
It looks perfect!

18:01.485 --> 18:02.986
Wasn't easy.

18:02.987 --> 18:04.610
I tried not to make
eye contact with her,

18:04.611 --> 18:06.756
'cause I was starting to get feelings.

18:06.757 --> 18:08.224
Hey, there you are.

18:08.225 --> 18:10.827
Are you okay? I know
my family can be a lot.

18:10.828 --> 18:13.229
No, I'm having a great time.

18:13.230 --> 18:14.998
You think your mom needs help

18:14.999 --> 18:16.266
putting out that macaron?

18:16.267 --> 18:17.834
I noticed they're not out.

18:17.835 --> 18:20.003
I also noticed one in the birdcage.

18:20.004 --> 18:21.537
You know what?

18:21.538 --> 18:23.706
If you're not having a
good time, we can leave.

18:23.707 --> 18:25.541
I'm a grown man. She's
not the boss of me.

18:25.542 --> 18:27.476
- Bobby!
- Coming, Ma!

18:29.612 --> 18:31.848
Caroline, relax.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.449
Nobody likes you right away.

18:33.450 --> 18:34.884
I just got there last year,

18:34.885 --> 18:37.287
and there's still a lot of red flags.

18:42.226 --> 18:45.194
Thank you for letting me
borrow Denise's Snuggie.

18:45.195 --> 18:48.631
I feel like I'm back in the womb again.

18:48.632 --> 18:51.434
But it doesn't reek of cigarettes.

18:51.435 --> 18:53.202
Wait.

18:53.203 --> 18:55.805
I think it does.

18:55.806 --> 18:57.106
I like it.

18:57.107 --> 18:58.374
I'm gonna like it even more

18:58.375 --> 19:01.577
when it's on the floor tonight.

19:01.578 --> 19:03.079
Is that one still breathing?

19:06.716 --> 19:09.319
All right, Ma, I'm going to karate.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.320
Karate?

19:10.321 --> 19:12.322
Well, well, well.

19:12.323 --> 19:14.157
Tae Kwon Hello.

19:14.158 --> 19:16.225
I happen to be a yellow belt.

19:16.226 --> 19:17.660
Oh, yeah?

19:20.130 --> 19:22.432
Oh, yeah.

19:22.433 --> 19:25.234
I got five of the macaron
back from the birdcage.

19:25.235 --> 19:28.171
I'll get your Snuggie
back to you by tomorrow.

19:28.172 --> 19:30.106
I'll give to Bobby in the morning

19:30.107 --> 19:31.606
when he leaves Caroline's.

19:34.310 --> 19:36.479
You said you slept at Brian's.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.980
You lying to me now?

19:37.981 --> 19:39.749
Ma...

19:39.750 --> 19:41.818
I was with Caroline last night.

19:41.819 --> 19:44.153
But I didn't see him naked.

19:44.154 --> 19:46.489
I did. Our bathroom door doesn't lock.

19:46.490 --> 19:48.890
I see why he's your favorite, Mrs. F.

19:50.460 --> 19:52.195
Uh, we're watching something.

19:52.196 --> 19:55.298
Can you two talk somewhere else?

19:55.299 --> 19:57.166
It's fine. I'll turn it up.

19:57.167 --> 19:59.168
Where... where's the remote?

19:59.169 --> 20:02.105
Whoa, Ma, I... I only
got engaged to be engaged

20:02.106 --> 20:04.273
'cause Dad was sick, and
I wanted you to be happy.

20:04.274 --> 20:06.676
But now I'm with Caroline, and...

20:06.677 --> 20:08.177
Caroline makes me happy.

20:08.178 --> 20:10.780
- I do?
- She does?

20:10.781 --> 20:11.781
You do.

20:11.782 --> 20:14.384
She does.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.789
- Okay, it was...
- Uh, it was a sign...

20:19.790 --> 20:24.025
that Jessica didn't
belong there anymore.

20:24.994 --> 20:26.462
You know what?

20:26.463 --> 20:28.197
You make my Bobby smile.

20:28.198 --> 20:30.366
And he's even more
handsome when he smiles.

20:30.367 --> 20:32.902
Chrissy, come down and meet Caroline!

20:32.903 --> 20:36.339
She hot? Cause I don't like uggos, Ma.

20:36.340 --> 20:38.474
She's gorgeous.

20:38.475 --> 20:40.176
She looks like me.

20:40.177 --> 20:43.346
Just with a little more mustache.

20:43.347 --> 20:45.014
Welcome to our home, girls.

20:45.015 --> 20:47.083
Oh, thank you!

20:47.084 --> 20:49.784
You have no idea how
much this means to me!

20:52.922 --> 20:54.757
Try and get out of this hold.

20:54.758 --> 20:56.691
