02:00.626 --> 02:02.334
Police.

02:02.334 --> 02:04.251
Show me your ID.

02:10.292 --> 02:12.209
- Check his ID.
- Yes sir.

02:12.917 --> 02:14.709
- What's in your bag?
- Headquarter,

02:14.709 --> 02:19.042
- Let me see.
- please verify ID number C532743...

02:19.042 --> 02:20.626
Bracket 1, Kwai Ching-hung.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.459
Open it.

02:33.084 --> 02:35.376
The arrangement for Hong Kong

02:35.376 --> 02:40.376
contained in the agreement
are not measures of expediency.

02:40.376 --> 02:44.584
They are long-term policies
which will be incorporated

02:44.584 --> 02:47.001
in the Basic Law for Hong Kong

02:47.001 --> 02:51.917
and preserved intact for 50 years from 1997.

02:52.792 --> 02:55.292
It is the common interests

02:55.292 --> 02:59.792
as well as shared
responsibilities of China and Britain

02:59.792 --> 03:07.209
to ensure the Joint Declaration is fully
implemented with no encumbrances.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.876
An armed robbery took place this afternoon in Kwun Tong.

03:30.876 --> 03:34.959
4 armed suspects robbed 5 gold shops
on Mut Wah Street.

03:34.959 --> 03:36.167
Fuck you!

03:36.167 --> 03:39.167
In the footage provided by our audience,

03:39.167 --> 03:42.542
the robbers exchanged fire

03:42.542 --> 03:44.626
with the Special Duties Unit.

03:44.626 --> 03:48.292
2 passersby and 3 policemen
were injured in the incident.

03:48.292 --> 03:51.292
The 5 gold shops lost $10M in total.

03:51.292 --> 03:53.584
The police believe the mastermind

03:53.584 --> 03:55.501
is the "Most Wanted" Yip Kwok-foon.

03:58.167 --> 04:02.334
Bro Foon, you're unbeatable!

04:02.876 --> 04:04.959
But shit has hit the fan!

04:05.667 --> 04:07.626
I told you to put more newspaper underneath!

04:07.626 --> 04:09.751
Look, there's blood everywhere!

04:09.751 --> 04:11.917
Take it, jerk!

04:15.209 --> 04:17.084
Shit has really hit the fan!

04:17.084 --> 04:20.459
I can give you 20% tops. Sorry.

04:20.459 --> 04:22.000
We agreed on 40%.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.626
Don't you have moral principle?

04:23.626 --> 04:26.001
You're paying $2M for $10M's worth of swag?

04:26.001 --> 04:27.501
We used to get 50%!

04:27.709 --> 04:29.501
Now you fences are getting it all!

04:29.501 --> 04:31.292
We're getting shit!

04:31.292 --> 04:33.334
Time has changed.

04:33.334 --> 04:35.876
The cops are on the prowl!

04:42.417 --> 04:45.334
Especially for your swag, Bro Foon!

04:45.334 --> 04:49.001
It took us 2 years to fence it last time!

04:49.209 --> 04:52.417
Stocks, real estate,
and even chestnuts are more profitable!

04:55.126 --> 04:56.917
Do me a favor.

04:56.917 --> 04:58.167
40%.

05:00.876 --> 05:04.626
Bro Foon, you always have your way!

05:09.584 --> 05:11.792
How about you find another fence?

05:11.792 --> 05:14.376
If I can't take it, I doubt others would dare to!

05:14.376 --> 05:15.959
Fuck you!

05:17.876 --> 05:19.876
Open the safe!

05:20.084 --> 05:21.501
Are you robbing me?

05:31.209 --> 05:33.334
Don't make me do it.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.709
Thanks so much, Bro Foon.

06:02.334 --> 06:04.792
Don't look me up in the future.

06:04.792 --> 06:06.792
There's no more business between us!

06:09.542 --> 06:11.417
We go separate ways!

06:45.667 --> 06:47.876
Light, Bro Foon.

07:17.042 --> 07:18.376
Fisherman!

07:28.084 --> 07:29.501
Don't worry.

07:29.501 --> 07:31.459
These ships belong to Yi Fa.

07:31.959 --> 07:32.792
What's Yi Fa?

07:32.792 --> 07:34.126
Yi Fa from Panyu, Guangzhou.

07:34.126 --> 07:35.626
They smuggle electric appliances.

07:36.667 --> 07:39.501
So pompously? So brazenly?

07:39.501 --> 07:43.292
They have strong backing. It's legit!

07:43.876 --> 07:49.667
A TV set sells for $2K
in Hong Kong and $8K in China.

07:53.251 --> 07:55.292
They earn millions of dollars in each transaction.

07:55.292 --> 07:57.376
Cash keeps rolling in!

08:10.209 --> 08:12.251
Used notes with no consecutive serial numbers.

08:12.542 --> 08:13.792
I need them today!

08:13.792 --> 08:15.501
You have $80M over there.

08:15.501 --> 08:19.209
I want it by 5pm!

08:19.209 --> 08:22.001
You go get it. I want it now!

08:23.042 --> 08:25.459
Manager Shum, how much do we have?

08:26.209 --> 08:27.584
Manager Fok!

08:42.458 --> 08:45.834
We are in love but can't be together.

08:45.834 --> 08:54.834
I wait day by day but you never come back...

08:54.834 --> 09:04.167
I want to forget you but you haunt my memory.

09:06.251 --> 09:07.959
Mr Cheuk,

09:07.959 --> 09:10.542
let's discuss the price.

09:15.542 --> 09:17.667
Was it a bit flat?

09:18.626 --> 09:20.459
No way! Let's start over!

09:21.959 --> 09:24.167
Red face,

09:24.626 --> 09:27.459
red skirt, red scarf,

09:28.376 --> 09:30.751
like white paper...

09:40.792 --> 09:43.501
I said let's start over. Didn't you hear me?

09:46.667 --> 09:49.542
I said let's start over. Didn't you hear me?

09:49.542 --> 09:51.459
Let's not waste time!

10:07.001 --> 10:08.417
Mr Tycoon,

10:10.876 --> 10:13.667
we agreed on $3 billion.

10:13.667 --> 10:15.292
That's final.

10:15.834 --> 10:18.584
It's impossible to get so much cash
out of the blue.

10:18.584 --> 10:21.542
I've only got $500M on hand.

10:27.376 --> 10:30.084
Did I say you could go?

10:30.459 --> 10:33.001
Take the $500M now.

10:33.001 --> 10:34.542
Don't get too greedy.

10:34.542 --> 10:36.251
Then I'll give you back half of your son.

10:36.251 --> 10:38.834
You want the upper or lower half?

10:38.834 --> 10:41.292
Do you really think I won't call the police?

10:42.959 --> 10:45.167
Do the cops know where your son is?

10:47.209 --> 10:53.209
All they can do is arrest and torture me.

10:53.209 --> 10:55.459
But after 48 hours, they have to release me.

10:55.459 --> 10:58.042
By that time, however, you son will be...

11:01.626 --> 11:03.792
Call the Commissioner of Police!

11:06.792 --> 11:09.376
I said let's start over. Didn't you hear me?

11:11.542 --> 11:14.876
You hear me, or not?

11:14.876 --> 11:17.084
If you can't hear me with your ear,

11:17.084 --> 11:19.876
I might as well cut if off, OK?

11:19.876 --> 11:23.209
Please don't!

11:23.209 --> 11:25.542
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

11:29.751 --> 11:32.542
You should've said so earlier.

11:45.667 --> 11:47.126
What's up?

11:47.126 --> 11:48.959
The Commissioner didn't answer?

11:59.042 --> 12:01.376
You're playing me, right?

12:01.376 --> 12:02.959
Let's play it all the way then!

12:19.417 --> 12:21.459
Leaving so soon, Officer Wu?

12:22.126 --> 12:23.626
Mr Tycoon is looking for you.

12:23.626 --> 12:26.959
Mr Tycoon, didn't you call the cops? Come here!

12:30.126 --> 12:31.334
Mr Ho.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.584
They are sending these dogs after me,

12:33.584 --> 12:35.167
but they are useless.

12:35.417 --> 12:38.542
No wonder it was easy to kidnap your son.

12:39.501 --> 12:41.167
So, you are willing to confess?

12:41.584 --> 12:42.792
Officer,

12:43.084 --> 12:46.459
if I said I'd fucked your mother,
did I really fuck her?

12:46.459 --> 12:49.542
Shouldn't you ask Mr Ho where his son is?

12:50.751 --> 12:52.126
My son...

12:52.417 --> 12:53.792
is all right.

12:54.459 --> 12:57.001
I came here to borrow money from Mr Tycoon.

12:57.001 --> 12:59.251
Is that a crime?

12:59.251 --> 13:01.709
Mr Ho, tell us if he's threatening you.

13:01.709 --> 13:03.001
We can arrest him right away!

13:03.417 --> 13:04.167
No, he's not.

13:04.167 --> 13:06.251
Have you heard it loud and clear, Officer?

13:06.459 --> 13:08.709
I said he's not threatening me!

13:10.251 --> 13:13.292
Calm down, Royal Hong Kong Police!

13:14.667 --> 13:15.667
Mr Tycoon,

13:15.667 --> 13:17.584
how much will you "lend" me?

13:18.042 --> 13:19.334
$3 billion.

13:41.084 --> 13:42.959
Are you in Guangzhou for business or leisure?

13:46.334 --> 13:47.334
Excuse me?

13:49.459 --> 13:51.584
Business? Travel?

13:53.084 --> 13:55.126
Yea, I am a businessman.

14:01.417 --> 14:05.042
Guangzhou Railway Station

14:25.792 --> 14:27.709
I'd like to reserve a private room

14:30.459 --> 14:31.917
at 8pm tomorrow.

14:33.001 --> 14:36.084
My name is Chen. Thank you.

15:00.792 --> 15:02.376
Hello, Commander.

15:02.376 --> 15:04.417
8pm tomorrow at Fengman Restaurant.

15:06.501 --> 15:08.751
Who the fuck am I? I'm Chiu.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.626
Don't make me fucking wait for you.

15:10.626 --> 15:11.834
That's it.

15:57.917 --> 16:01.501
Fengman Restaurant

16:02.459 --> 16:04.584
Almost there, Mr Fong.

16:04.584 --> 16:05.584
OK.

16:06.501 --> 16:07.876
Which room?

16:08.084 --> 16:10.042
OK. Coming.

16:10.042 --> 16:11.459
- Take it.
- What?

16:11.459 --> 16:13.667
Take it. Let me put the tie on.

16:15.417 --> 16:16.626
Da-bao. This way.

16:16.626 --> 16:17.459
Mr Fong.

16:17.459 --> 16:18.501
Where's the vase?

16:18.876 --> 16:19.876
It's just a cheap one.

16:19.876 --> 16:21.251
Never mind. Let's go.

16:23.167 --> 16:24.501
Chief Chen.

16:28.917 --> 16:30.459
Chief Chen.

16:33.001 --> 16:37.792
This is Zhang Da-bao, Boss Zhang,

16:37.792 --> 16:38.917
who has bought Yi Fa.

16:38.917 --> 16:41.626
This is Chief Chen from Industry and Commerce.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.167
We're buddies.

16:43.417 --> 16:44.334
Nice to meet you, Chief Chen.

16:44.334 --> 16:45.626
Nice to meet you.

16:45.876 --> 16:46.501
Let's have a drink.

16:46.501 --> 16:47.417
Let's drink together.

16:47.417 --> 16:49.334
Have a seat.

16:51.334 --> 16:52.459
Bottoms up!

16:56.584 --> 16:58.209
Boss Zhang cannot drink?

16:58.209 --> 16:59.292
Bottoms up!

16:59.292 --> 17:01.001
I said bottoms up!

17:01.001 --> 17:01.876
Yes!

17:01.876 --> 17:03.501
Bottoms up!

17:08.209 --> 17:09.876
Da-bao is my buddy.

17:10.291 --> 17:12.626
We've only met quite recently.

17:12.626 --> 17:15.376
But we hit it off right away!

17:15.376 --> 17:16.751
Chief Chen,

17:17.626 --> 17:19.126
Chief Chen,

17:19.666 --> 17:21.126
please help him.

17:21.126 --> 17:25.209
This vase must be expensive!

17:25.709 --> 17:27.416
Just a modest gift.

17:27.666 --> 17:29.001
Here's how it works:

17:29.001 --> 17:32.584
when Chief Chen grows tired of it,
Boss Zhang can buy it back!

17:32.584 --> 17:35.334
It's worth at least RMB¥300K!

17:37.251 --> 17:39.209
Didn't we agree on RMB¥200K?

17:40.126 --> 17:41.709
I got the price wrong?

17:42.376 --> 17:44.459
Oh, even Homer sometimes nods.

17:44.459 --> 17:45.667
No way!

17:45.667 --> 17:48.917
Chief Chen is a connoisseur.

17:48.917 --> 17:50.709
What do we know?

17:50.709 --> 17:53.126
If Chief Chen says RMB¥300K, then it's RMB¥300K.

17:54.251 --> 17:56.167
Come get the business license tomorrow.

17:56.167 --> 17:59.501
I'll have it nicely framed for you.

17:59.501 --> 18:00.751
Thanks so much, Chief Chen.

18:00.751 --> 18:02.501
We're buddies.

18:02.501 --> 18:05.251
Boss Zhang, what would you like to eat?

18:06.209 --> 18:08.292
Braised pork with preserved vegetables.

18:09.292 --> 18:11.501
That's too oily for me.

18:13.834 --> 18:15.042
Let me order.

18:15.292 --> 18:18.042
Shall we have a seafood platter?

18:18.459 --> 18:19.876
Let me order it.

18:19.876 --> 18:21.167
Waiter!

18:21.167 --> 18:23.167
Mr Zhang, best of luck with your business!

18:23.167 --> 18:24.709
Thanks a lot.

18:25.292 --> 18:26.167
Cheers.

18:26.167 --> 18:26.834
Bottoms up!

18:27.209 --> 18:28.542
Bottoms up!

18:38.376 --> 18:42.209
This guy plays golf every Sunday
in Clear Water Bay.

18:42.209 --> 18:47.501
One-way road. Quiet. No phone signal. It may work.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.292
Hey! Where's our rice?

18:49.292 --> 18:50.501
Next.

18:51.334 --> 18:53.126
This one is easy.

18:53.126 --> 18:55.251
A super playboy.

18:55.251 --> 18:57.667
Drunk every night.

18:58.959 --> 19:01.709
He recently has an actress as a mistress.

19:04.709 --> 19:05.626
Hey!

19:05.626 --> 19:06.542
Where is our rice?

19:06.542 --> 19:07.917
Rice? Give me a second.

19:07.917 --> 19:09.626
Your rice is coming right away.

19:11.084 --> 19:13.001
Sometimes he would send his driver away.

19:13.001 --> 19:15.126
Sorry to keep you waiting.

19:15.126 --> 19:16.334
Enjoy your food.

19:16.751 --> 19:18.001
Close the door.

19:21.626 --> 19:23.542
Sir, please follow me.

19:23.792 --> 19:25.042
Give me a cup of tea.

19:25.042 --> 19:26.542
Hey! Haven't you gone to the bathroom just now?

19:26.542 --> 19:28.376
- Wait! Don't puke.
- Hey! The rice is cold!

19:28.376 --> 19:29.459
Give me a second.

19:29.459 --> 19:30.959
- I'm sorry. The rice is cold?
- I want tea.

19:30.959 --> 19:32.459
- Hurry up!
- Tell me the room number...

19:32.459 --> 19:34.626
- I want tea.
- Give me a second. I'll show you the way.

19:34.626 --> 19:35.542
Sure, I'll get you tea.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.042
Give me a second. I will be right back.

19:40.667 --> 19:42.626
Take it easy.

19:42.626 --> 19:45.334
We came to China to shake off those cop dogs.

19:45.334 --> 19:46.459
You went too far last time!

19:46.459 --> 19:48.751
I live life to the full.

19:49.834 --> 19:51.959
C'est la vie.

19:51.959 --> 19:53.584
There's no other way.

19:57.251 --> 20:01.876
We've stolen cars, committed burglaries,

20:01.876 --> 20:03.251
and robbed cash vans.

20:04.251 --> 20:07.126
We even kidnapped the tycoon's son.

20:07.126 --> 20:08.626
Should we do more kidnaps?

20:10.584 --> 20:12.334
What do you have in mind?

20:13.251 --> 20:15.292
Spit it out. We can discuss.

20:38.876 --> 20:41.209
I'm a mountaineer.

20:41.876 --> 20:43.584
After conquering one mountain,

20:43.584 --> 20:47.209
I need to find a higher and harder mountain.

20:48.126 --> 20:49.709
That's it.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.001
Before finding that mountain,

20:54.001 --> 20:55.876
let's find the money first.

20:57.584 --> 20:58.792
Let's keep doing it.

21:00.001 --> 21:02.376
Cheng, 53 years old.

21:02.376 --> 21:05.792
No children. His wife is in charge.

21:06.542 --> 21:10.126
A mobile phone used to cost over RMB¥10K.
Who could afford that?

21:10.126 --> 21:12.792
Not everyone is a child of
a high-ranking official.

21:14.376 --> 21:16.501
Now the cheaper, the better.

21:17.834 --> 21:20.251
We have a population of 10 million.

21:20.251 --> 21:22.709
Say RMB¥1K a set,

21:24.626 --> 21:27.209
RMB¥10K for 10 sets.

21:27.209 --> 21:30.834
We will be fatter than Chow Yun-fat!

21:31.917 --> 21:35.709
Beepers are already outdated.

21:36.959 --> 21:41.542
OK, I'll talk to you later.

21:44.667 --> 21:47.126
Excuse me, Boss.

21:50.917 --> 21:52.334
Please go on.

21:53.251 --> 21:56.751
Don't give us a hard time.
We're doing small business.

21:56.751 --> 22:01.834
Big Bro, these kids are great.

22:02.584 --> 22:04.542
The guy who came in first
has criminal record in Hong Kong.

22:04.542 --> 22:06.209
Don't know why you brought him here.

22:06.917 --> 22:08.751
I told you to bring some decent-looking guys.

22:08.751 --> 22:11.459
They all look like criminals and idiots.

22:12.001 --> 22:15.376
You should be out of business.

22:20.542 --> 22:22.084
What is he staring at?

22:25.917 --> 22:29.417
He is smart and helpful

22:31.917 --> 22:33.751
I don't want the guy in blue either.

22:35.126 --> 22:37.001
You only need two men this time?

22:37.917 --> 22:40.792
Take the others to broaden their horizons.

22:46.501 --> 22:49.251
Got it!

22:49.251 --> 22:50.917
Let me see to it.

22:52.751 --> 22:55.834
What are you fucking looking at?

22:55.834 --> 22:58.376
You, you, get lost!

22:58.376 --> 23:01.709
Stop drinking and scram!

23:01.709 --> 23:03.959
You two come with me.

23:08.001 --> 23:09.834
Faster.

23:09.834 --> 23:11.417
So slow!

23:14.209 --> 23:15.542
Big Bro Chiu,

23:15.542 --> 23:16.667
Wang Lei.

23:16.667 --> 23:17.959
Hong Qi.

23:17.959 --> 23:19.001
Say Big Bro Chiu.

23:19.001 --> 23:19.917
Big Bro Chiu!

23:21.376 --> 23:22.334
They understand Cantonese?

23:22.334 --> 23:25.209
Of course!

23:26.417 --> 23:29.334
Come have a drink.

23:29.667 --> 23:31.126
Spruce them up before sending them to Hong Kong.

23:31.126 --> 23:33.584
Sure will!

23:48.126 --> 23:49.417
Motherfucker.

23:49.417 --> 23:51.042
Sit and eat.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.084
Commander,

23:56.084 --> 23:57.876
who's this Big Bro Chiu?

23:59.209 --> 24:02.167
Who cares if he is Big Bro Chiu or not?

24:05.959 --> 24:07.501
He is a douchebag.

24:07.542 --> 24:09.251
He is a sly.

24:09.251 --> 24:11.334
Old fox who changes identities.

24:12.792 --> 24:16.501
He looks fucking like Kwai Ching-hung,

24:16.501 --> 24:18.292
the invisible King of Thieves in Hong Kong.

24:19.126 --> 24:21.959
Kwai Ching-hung disappeared

24:21.959 --> 24:23.542
after killing cops.

24:23.626 --> 24:26.417
Then Big Bro Chiu popped up.

24:26.417 --> 24:30.334
Big Bro Chiu is just a name.

24:51.917 --> 24:53.459
Is Fai here?

24:54.251 --> 24:55.792
Fai.

24:56.667 --> 24:57.417
What's up?

24:57.417 --> 24:59.084
- Someone is looking for you.
- Hey.

25:01.334 --> 25:02.626
Bro Coke?

25:03.334 --> 25:04.167
Hey!

25:04.167 --> 25:04.917
She's Thai?

25:04.917 --> 25:06.376
Noon, go buy a dozen of Cokes.

25:06.376 --> 25:07.584
When did you come back?

25:07.584 --> 25:08.792
Just now.

25:09.542 --> 25:12.126
You are too kind. Come in and have a seat.

25:12.126 --> 25:13.126
Did you just speak Thai?

25:13.126 --> 25:15.251
Do you think I speak French?

25:33.001 --> 25:34.209
You stink!

25:34.209 --> 25:35.709
Really?

25:35.917 --> 25:37.001
Bo.

25:37.001 --> 25:38.751
How can you be so rude?

25:38.751 --> 25:40.542
Come help set the table.

25:41.084 --> 25:42.626
Dinner will be served soon.

25:43.417 --> 25:44.709
Naughty girl.

25:45.001 --> 25:45.834
Go wash your hands.

25:45.834 --> 25:47.334
I did wash my hands.

25:48.084 --> 25:51.334
You ate yesterday. Are you going to eat today?

25:52.917 --> 25:55.709
Bo, slow down. Don't rush.

25:55.709 --> 25:57.126
Bro Coke.

25:59.417 --> 26:00.417
You want some?

26:00.417 --> 26:02.209
Shall we share it?

26:03.917 --> 26:04.876
Don't let her drink it.

26:04.876 --> 26:07.292
She was coughing.
I don't wanna spend money on meds.

26:07.292 --> 26:09.251
I wasn't coughing. I just had a fever.

26:09.251 --> 26:11.001
It's all right to have a sip.

26:11.001 --> 26:13.042
Not coughing? You are being cheeky!

26:13.042 --> 26:14.417
I say no Coke.

26:21.792 --> 26:24.792
Fai, I'm not gonna eat. I'm running late.

26:26.042 --> 26:27.126
You're going now?

26:27.126 --> 26:27.876
Yes.

26:31.709 --> 26:33.667
Be a good girl.

26:36.751 --> 26:38.334
Bro Coke, dig in.

26:39.167 --> 26:40.251
She's not eating with us?

26:40.251 --> 26:42.167
She has to work night shift.

26:45.251 --> 26:47.167
She's a legit masseuse.

26:48.376 --> 26:49.917
Eat some barbecued pork.

26:50.251 --> 26:51.917
Bo, eat some veggies.

26:51.917 --> 26:53.542
You seldom eat veggies.

26:55.876 --> 26:57.751
Shall we go to Ocean Park?

27:00.459 --> 27:02.209
Shall we ride the roller coaster?

27:06.501 --> 27:10.084
Shall we fly higher and farther?

27:10.084 --> 27:14.126
Tickle, tickle.

27:18.626 --> 27:20.584
Stop making noise, or the landlady will be nasty.

27:20.584 --> 27:22.834
She's nasty because you haven't paid the rent.

27:22.834 --> 27:24.334
You're being cheeky. Come down.

27:24.334 --> 27:27.001
What a dragon lady, arguing with your father!

27:27.417 --> 27:30.376
This girl plays too much! Wear your slippers.

27:30.376 --> 27:33.459
Have you finished your homework? Homework first.

27:33.459 --> 27:34.542
Quick!

27:36.001 --> 27:37.792
- I'll spank you.
- Good girl.

27:38.751 --> 27:40.626
This naughty girl!

27:43.126 --> 27:44.417
I've quit smoking.

27:44.792 --> 27:45.501
Quit?

27:45.834 --> 27:46.501
I've quit smoking.

27:46.501 --> 27:47.917
"Whoring, gambling, drinking, roaming...

27:47.917 --> 27:49.584
and smoking are the hobbies of a king."

27:49.584 --> 27:51.126
Your mantra.

27:54.042 --> 27:56.709
I'm on dialysis. I have to quit.

27:57.751 --> 27:59.001
Told you you're impotent.

27:59.001 --> 28:00.084
You feel dizzy when you squat.

28:00.084 --> 28:01.126
Fuck!

28:02.626 --> 28:04.209
What have you been up to?

28:04.542 --> 28:06.292
What can I do?

28:06.292 --> 28:08.334
I used to do temporary construction work.

28:08.334 --> 28:09.626
Now I'm a full-time babysitter.

28:09.626 --> 28:11.376
What about you?

28:11.376 --> 28:12.376
Me?

28:13.084 --> 28:15.209
I sell this in China.

28:16.542 --> 28:18.584
People won't use beepers anymore.

28:18.876 --> 28:20.709
Every Chinese will own
a mobile phone in the future.

28:20.709 --> 28:23.459
One Sells for RMB¥1K, 10 for RMB¥10K.

28:23.459 --> 28:24.792
I'll be fatter than Chow Yun-fat.

28:24.792 --> 28:26.459
Fat with loads of money?

28:26.959 --> 28:29.251
Great.

28:32.167 --> 28:35.167
You're doing great. You're becoming a boss.

28:36.751 --> 28:41.667
Going straight is better than going astray.

28:41.667 --> 28:44.584
We're not fierce enough to be Kings of Thieves.

28:44.584 --> 28:47.292
All we did were some petty crimes.

28:47.292 --> 28:51.501
Our life was insecure. We couldn't sleep well.

28:51.501 --> 28:54.959
And we didn't earn that much.
So what's the point?

29:01.251 --> 29:03.084
I'd like to stay here for a few days.

29:03.084 --> 29:03.834
What?

29:03.834 --> 29:05.292
I can sleep on the couch.

29:06.626 --> 29:07.501
What's that for?

29:07.501 --> 29:11.334
Take it. It will lessen your wife's burden.

29:12.751 --> 29:16.209
Dad, I can't find my school manual!

29:16.834 --> 29:18.292
Dad, Dad.

29:18.292 --> 29:19.584
Coming!

29:21.542 --> 29:22.667
That's fine

29:38.084 --> 29:40.626
(Gold shop)

29:51.126 --> 29:54.334
(Jockey Club)

29:54.334 --> 29:57.084
Panyu Yi Fa Market

29:59.167 --> 30:01.667
30 sets of 29-inch TVs. RMB¥12K apiece.

30:01.667 --> 30:04.376
Plus 80 VCD players. RMB¥4K a piece.

30:04.376 --> 30:06.042
RMB¥680K, thank you.

30:09.084 --> 30:10.959
You pay me RMB¥700K.

30:11.501 --> 30:12.751
I will notify you once the goods are delivered.

30:12.751 --> 30:13.959
Next.

30:13.959 --> 30:17.167
RMB¥30K for Chief Chen. Please count it.

30:19.667 --> 30:23.209
Business License

30:35.167 --> 30:38.126
RMB¥30K. The amount is correct.

30:39.209 --> 30:40.959
Will notify you once the goods are onboard.

30:43.084 --> 30:45.126
Please extend my thanks to Chief Chen.

30:46.167 --> 30:49.751
My VCD player is broken.

30:49.751 --> 30:51.834
I'll give you a new one. Kam.

30:51.834 --> 30:52.751
Yes.

30:54.334 --> 30:57.667
The latest 33-inch TV set.

30:57.667 --> 30:59.084
Good stuff.

30:59.084 --> 31:00.459
I'll give it to you, too.

31:00.459 --> 31:01.959
Thanks so much, Boss Zhang.

31:01.959 --> 31:03.001
You're welcome.

31:04.709 --> 31:08.959
Gui, Guang, a 33-inch TV set and a VCD player.

31:08.959 --> 31:10.292
Sure.

31:11.459 --> 31:14.167
Da-bao Electronics

31:15.792 --> 31:17.626
She is greedy.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.167
That's business.

31:20.417 --> 31:22.542
Don't pull a long face all day long.

31:22.542 --> 31:24.209
Boss Zhang, Boss Zhang.

31:24.209 --> 31:26.584
No worries. They will take care of it.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.167
- Quick
- What's wrong?

31:28.376 --> 31:30.167
Boss Zhang.

31:30.167 --> 31:31.542
What's wrong?

31:35.042 --> 31:36.042
Something wrong with the goods?

31:36.042 --> 31:38.042
No, close the door.

31:38.042 --> 31:39.667
Close the door.

31:44.917 --> 31:49.376
Want to play tough guy? Call your wife now.

31:59.709 --> 32:01.292
Call your wife now.

32:01.584 --> 32:02.876
Tell your folks you're OK, asshole.

32:02.876 --> 32:05.001
If you kill me, you won't get a cent.

32:05.001 --> 32:06.626
Are you threatening me?

32:10.876 --> 32:12.751
Cheuk, be patient.

32:12.751 --> 32:15.167
If he doesn't talk, don't give him food or water.

32:22.292 --> 32:24.667
You're so noisy.

32:25.417 --> 32:27.334
Hey, what are you doing?

32:27.334 --> 32:29.376
Get him back! Get him back!

32:29.792 --> 32:31.959
This is the gold shop.

32:31.959 --> 32:34.042
Usually there's a police wagon at the entrance.

32:34.042 --> 32:35.959
Jockey Club is across the street.

32:35.959 --> 32:38.167
We keep a close eye on the police wagon.

32:38.167 --> 32:42.084
As soon as it leaves at 8pm,
we rob the gold shop right away.

32:42.584 --> 32:45.126
It's the racing night. It will be crowded.
After it's done...

32:45.126 --> 32:47.376
- There's not much money in this.
- Follow me closely.

32:48.876 --> 32:50.001
What did you just say?

32:52.167 --> 32:54.376
You've committed big crimes.

32:54.376 --> 32:57.042
Why pick this small gold shop?

32:57.042 --> 32:58.126
Yes,

32:58.126 --> 33:01.417
I've heard the 3 Kings
of Thieves would join forces.

33:01.626 --> 33:04.126
At least millions of dollars will be involved.

33:04.917 --> 33:06.751
What 3 Kings of Thieves?

33:07.501 --> 33:08.876
Say it!

33:09.876 --> 33:13.584
Bro Foon, are you making a comeback?

33:13.584 --> 33:16.126
This time with Cheuk Tze-keung
and Kwai Ching-hung.

33:16.126 --> 33:20.709
The 3 Kings of Thieves are collaborating?

33:21.626 --> 33:24.001
Someone has seen you three meeting in China.

33:25.459 --> 33:27.084
Where did you hear this?

33:27.792 --> 33:29.376
Everyone is saying that.

33:29.626 --> 33:31.209
And you believe it?

33:31.209 --> 33:35.167
Didn't Big Bro say you couldn't
make money by toting guns?

33:35.792 --> 33:36.876
If I'm Kwai,

33:36.876 --> 33:38.209
I don't have
to eat lunch boxes with you.

33:40.001 --> 33:41.542
Idiots.

33:44.001 --> 33:45.542
That's ridiculous!

33:45.792 --> 33:47.459
Yip is all noise and fury.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.167
Kwai is hush and shush.

33:49.167 --> 33:51.376
We are so different. How can it work?

33:51.542 --> 33:53.626
Smuggle more goods with me.

33:53.626 --> 33:55.459
Let's make more money together!

33:56.542 --> 33:57.876
Got it.

33:57.876 --> 33:59.001
Brilliant!

33:59.001 --> 34:03.084
Sometimes I feel like toting my gun again.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.751
Robbery! Robbery!

34:04.751 --> 34:05.876
That's so cool!

34:05.876 --> 34:07.209
You call that cool?

34:07.709 --> 34:09.792
Big Bro wielding AK-47 is cool!

34:10.583 --> 34:12.001
Not like this.

34:12.501 --> 34:14.042
AK-47 recoil is powerful.

34:14.042 --> 34:15.333
Don't hold it.

34:15.333 --> 34:16.458
Press it.

34:16.458 --> 34:17.458
Stand firm.

34:17.458 --> 34:19.167
Shoot the hell out of him.

34:28.917 --> 34:32.083
What the fuck?! Join me

34:33.167 --> 34:35.126
or go home and eat shit.

34:38.917 --> 34:41.501
Big Bro Chiu,

34:41.917 --> 34:45.542
how much can we earn from robbing this gold shop?

34:52.458 --> 34:53.292
You're calling or not?

34:53.292 --> 34:57.209
If the 3 Kings of Thieves join forces,

34:57.209 --> 34:59.042
even if we open a fish ball stall together,

34:59.042 --> 35:01.417
we will create a stir, right?

35:01.876 --> 35:03.876
What shall I call our stall?

35:03.876 --> 35:05.126
Are you calling your family or not?

35:23.209 --> 35:24.876
Hey, wake up!

35:27.251 --> 35:28.459
Gold depository?

35:29.001 --> 35:30.251
Racecourse?

35:35.084 --> 35:37.084
Kidnap Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten?

35:37.084 --> 35:38.959
The Head of Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, Lu Ping?

35:39.501 --> 35:40.709
No way.

36:03.126 --> 36:04.251
What are you listening?

36:04.251 --> 36:06.334
The 4 Heavenly Kings singing on stage together.

36:06.334 --> 36:07.626
What are they singing?

36:09.459 --> 36:11.667
I can't hear a thing. What's so good about it?

36:12.042 --> 36:14.042
When the 4 Heavenly Kings sing together,

36:14.042 --> 36:15.959
it's terrific no matter what they sing.

36:18.084 --> 36:20.792
Water, give me water.

36:21.084 --> 36:24.001
I will make the call.

36:36.292 --> 36:38.334
How's my husband? I beg you!

36:38.334 --> 36:40.709
He's not in good health. Don't hurt him.

36:40.709 --> 36:44.209
We are not as loaded as it may seem.

36:44.209 --> 36:46.501
Mr Cheuk, can you let my husband go?

36:46.501 --> 36:49.126
Name a price. I'll pay you from my own pocket...

36:56.876 --> 36:58.042
Hello?

36:58.042 --> 37:01.209
I have $80M in cash.

37:01.209 --> 37:02.501
Is it OK?

37:02.792 --> 37:04.251
$80M it is!

37:04.251 --> 37:06.209
Find Yip and Kwai!

37:09.584 --> 37:10.376
What the hell?

37:10.376 --> 37:11.959
The 3 Kings of Thieves
join forces for the first time.

37:11.959 --> 37:14.084
It will be terrific no matter what we do!

37:14.376 --> 37:15.501
You don't even have a plan yet,

37:15.501 --> 37:17.084
and you want 2 wanted men around you?

37:17.084 --> 37:17.834
You know I will

37:17.834 --> 37:19.167
come up with a plan!

37:19.667 --> 37:21.876
This is the mountain I'm looking for.

37:21.876 --> 37:23.959
Himalaya!

37:52.584 --> 37:54.084
Having night snack?

37:54.376 --> 37:55.334
There's Coke in the fridge.

37:55.334 --> 37:57.042
OK, I'll get it myself.

38:10.292 --> 38:13.834
Fai, how long is your friend staying?

38:16.334 --> 38:18.126
3 or 4 nights.

38:18.459 --> 38:19.917
We have a daughter.

38:19.917 --> 38:21.792
I don't feel comfortable...

38:21.792 --> 38:23.751
with a guy suddenly staying with us.

38:24.709 --> 38:28.042
What does he do?

38:29.626 --> 38:32.834
He sells mobile phones.

38:32.834 --> 38:34.251
Don't worry.

38:34.751 --> 38:36.251
Go to sleep.

38:36.251 --> 38:36.792
OK.

38:36.792 --> 38:41.042
I'll go to bed after sewing.

38:47.209 --> 38:50.084
I will arrive with clients in 3 minutes.

38:50.251 --> 38:51.584
Got it.

38:55.209 --> 38:58.959
Gui, Guang, unload the goods. Be quick.

39:17.292 --> 39:18.501
Big Bro, we have a situation!

39:18.501 --> 39:20.334
Panyu Customs!

39:21.709 --> 39:23.709
Kam! Kam!

39:23.709 --> 39:25.209
Chung, pull over!

39:29.667 --> 39:31.542
Take a look over there.

39:31.542 --> 39:32.917
Take a look again over there.

39:34.626 --> 39:36.126
Don't move. Hands on your head.

39:36.751 --> 39:38.167
Let's go.

39:40.251 --> 39:41.584
Let's go.

39:42.417 --> 39:44.042
What about Kam?

39:44.042 --> 39:45.792
Find Mr Fong.

39:49.126 --> 39:52.542
Chinese customs

39:56.459 --> 39:57.959
Comrade.

39:57.959 --> 39:59.126
What do you want?

39:59.126 --> 40:00.709
We're looking for Chief Long.

40:00.709 --> 40:02.334
We're wondering

40:02.334 --> 40:06.542
if he can discharge the Lianhuashan goods and men?

40:11.667 --> 40:13.751
We know Mr Fong.

40:15.376 --> 40:17.417
In 4 days, the goods will be confiscated

40:17.417 --> 40:19.834
and the men will be executed.

40:20.376 --> 40:22.126
Yes, we understand.

40:43.209 --> 40:45.167
Chief, someone wants to see you.

40:45.167 --> 40:47.876
OK.

40:51.542 --> 40:53.209
Chief Long is busy today.

40:53.209 --> 40:54.709
Come again tomorrow.

41:11.251 --> 41:13.501
All right. Yes...

41:18.167 --> 41:20.042
Chief Long is not seeing guests today.

41:20.042 --> 41:21.292
Come again tomorrow.

41:21.626 --> 41:22.459
Asshole.

41:22.459 --> 41:24.417
Who do you think you are?

41:25.459 --> 41:27.209
You don't want to save Kam anymore?

41:29.084 --> 41:30.751
Yes, yes.

41:36.709 --> 41:38.709
Chief Long said he wanted to talk over dinner.

41:38.709 --> 41:40.459
Find a restaurant and wait for him.

41:40.459 --> 41:41.584
Good.

41:41.584 --> 41:43.626
Fengman Restaurant.

41:52.751 --> 41:53.542
Hello?

41:53.542 --> 41:55.626
I am in Fugui Restaurant with Chief Long.

41:55.917 --> 41:57.251
Coming right away.

41:57.251 --> 41:58.292
Let's go.

41:58.751 --> 42:00.501
Remember to bring a vase.

42:02.626 --> 42:03.501
Take the vase.

42:03.501 --> 42:04.876
Quick!

42:04.876 --> 42:06.042
Okay!

42:12.167 --> 42:13.209
Hurry up!

42:14.792 --> 42:15.917
Chief Long of Customs.

42:15.917 --> 42:17.542
He's my buddy.

42:17.542 --> 42:19.167
Chief Long, nice to meet you.

42:19.167 --> 42:22.959
I'm an official but you made me wait!

42:24.376 --> 42:25.334
Sorry,

42:25.334 --> 42:26.501
I went to Fengman Restaurant.

42:26.501 --> 42:28.334
Is the food there edible?

42:29.001 --> 42:31.209
He knows nothing about food!

42:31.209 --> 42:34.667
Chief Long is a foodie.

42:34.959 --> 42:36.542
Yes, you're right.

42:38.084 --> 42:40.834
Chief Long, he's my buddy.

42:40.834 --> 42:43.292
Help him this time.

42:43.709 --> 42:45.334
Thank you.

42:45.334 --> 42:47.626
He's your buddy, not mine.

42:47.876 --> 42:51.917
I only help my friends!

42:51.917 --> 42:54.917
If we hit it off, we're friends.

42:55.334 --> 42:56.501
I'm hungry!

42:56.501 --> 42:57.251
Let's order first.

42:57.251 --> 42:59.584
Yes, let's order.

43:00.459 --> 43:02.667
What would you like?

43:02.667 --> 43:03.834
Braised pork with preserved vegetables.

43:03.834 --> 43:06.584
It's not refined enough for me.

43:07.209 --> 43:08.417
Let's order delicacies.

43:08.417 --> 43:09.959
Waiter!

43:17.251 --> 43:18.834
Thanks a lot.

43:21.209 --> 43:24.001
What's your name?

43:24.001 --> 43:25.459
Boss Zhang.

43:25.792 --> 43:27.626
Boss Zhang, right?

43:28.209 --> 43:31.667
You're a fun guy! A fun guy!

43:31.667 --> 43:33.667
Thank you.

43:34.209 --> 43:36.792
Chief Long, thanks for your help.

43:37.334 --> 43:41.667
Let's sing karaoke first.

43:41.667 --> 43:43.626
OK, karaoke first.

43:45.042 --> 43:46.251
Chung

43:46.626 --> 43:48.834
Give me name cards of karaoke bars and the phone.

43:48.834 --> 43:49.834
Let's go for more fun.

43:49.834 --> 43:52.042
I can't...

43:53.917 --> 43:55.751
Let's take a bath.

43:57.042 --> 43:58.459
It's good to take a bath.

43:58.459 --> 44:00.459
Find a sauna.

44:03.542 --> 44:06.001
Don't forget the vase.

44:06.001 --> 44:07.417
Yes.

44:16.626 --> 44:19.667
Chinese customs

44:19.667 --> 44:22.376
Thanks to connections,
I didn't need to rot in jail.

44:22.709 --> 44:24.251
We stayed in a motel,

44:24.251 --> 44:26.792
with a bed, TV, OK food,

44:26.792 --> 44:28.376
though no whores!

44:28.542 --> 44:30.126
It's not bad, huh? What do you say?

44:30.126 --> 44:31.501
Yes, yes.

44:33.876 --> 44:36.792
Asshole, you didn't need to carouse
with those officials!

44:37.209 --> 44:39.084
Don't complain about carousing,

44:39.084 --> 44:40.584
for money's sake.

44:43.959 --> 44:45.751
Hey! Come here.

44:45.751 --> 44:47.501
Our goods!

44:53.751 --> 44:55.084
Come.

44:55.751 --> 44:59.626
Your goods are here.

45:00.209 --> 45:01.501
Take a look. Any problems?

45:01.501 --> 45:04.001
Thanks so much.

45:04.001 --> 45:06.001
Let me take a look.

45:06.001 --> 45:10.417
Sign here if there's no problem.

45:10.417 --> 45:11.959
Thanks so much.

45:34.167 --> 45:35.626
OK.

47:38.792 --> 47:41.834
Your mole hasn't found Kwai's dossier

47:41.834 --> 47:43.209
in the police station?

47:49.792 --> 47:53.251
No news about Yip in China?

47:56.542 --> 47:59.126
What about his underlings? His fences?

47:59.126 --> 48:02.667
His fellow illegal immigrants? His village mates?

48:03.042 --> 48:04.584
Can't find them?

48:05.792 --> 48:07.126
Nothing at all?

48:11.501 --> 48:12.709
Good.

48:14.084 --> 48:15.459
Good.

48:25.376 --> 48:26.751
Fuck you!

48:27.251 --> 48:29.167
Fuck you!

48:30.751 --> 48:33.251
The cops have offered a $1M reward on him.

48:33.251 --> 48:34.834
But there's no news over these years.

48:34.834 --> 48:37.376
Give me some time.

48:37.376 --> 48:39.501
Reward money is a good idea.

48:41.001 --> 48:43.542
The cops offer $1M; I'll up it to $10M!

48:43.542 --> 48:45.417
If it's not enough, then $100M!

48:45.876 --> 48:47.709
I'll set up a special phone line.

48:47.709 --> 48:51.126
Whoever knows their
whereabouts will get the money.

48:52.584 --> 48:55.292
So brazenly? The cops will tap the phone.

48:55.292 --> 48:59.001
Those assholes will prevent the 3 Kings
from meeting up.

48:59.376 --> 49:00.917
Not necessarily.

49:01.542 --> 49:03.584
The cops want them too.

49:03.584 --> 49:05.792
They will send loads of people after us.

49:06.626 --> 49:08.876
Find a way to shake them off.

49:16.751 --> 49:17.709
Hello?

49:17.709 --> 49:18.667
Are you Cheuk?

49:18.667 --> 49:19.417
Yes.

49:23.834 --> 49:26.042
Noon tomorrow. Bring a purple umbrella
to Temple Street.

49:26.042 --> 49:27.334
I'll have you picked up.

49:28.126 --> 49:29.251
Get on.

49:33.001 --> 49:33.959
Take off your clothes.

49:33.959 --> 49:34.792
Take them all off.

50:01.292 --> 50:04.667
I worked with Kwai once. He's so average.

50:04.667 --> 50:08.584
I know Yip. He lived in Guangdong.

50:08.584 --> 50:09.876
Kwai's real name is Xing Zhennan.

50:09.876 --> 50:11.334
His ancestral house was built by me.

50:11.501 --> 50:12.584
Yes.

50:13.584 --> 50:14.292
OK.

50:34.626 --> 50:37.542
I drove for Yip and was chased by the cops.

50:37.542 --> 50:39.001
I fenced for Yip.

50:39.042 --> 50:40.501
I was present in Yip's every heist.

50:40.542 --> 50:41.542
We wielded AK-47 together.

50:41.584 --> 50:44.251
Mr Cheuk, I envy you. I admire all your works.

50:44.251 --> 50:46.751
Yip bought sex from me.

50:46.751 --> 50:49.376
He was loud and proud.

50:51.709 --> 50:54.667
Heists? Hong Kong kids?

50:54.667 --> 50:57.834
These barking dogs are sneaky wussies.

50:57.834 --> 51:02.501
I imported the Chinese
retired soldiers to Hong Kong.

51:03.084 --> 51:05.917
What did I teach them before a heist?

51:05.917 --> 51:07.959
Moral principle!

51:07.959 --> 51:10.042
Father of the Chinese retired soldiers,

51:10.042 --> 51:11.501
can you cut to the chase?

51:11.501 --> 51:13.751
Do you know Yip or Kwai?

51:13.751 --> 51:16.626
Don't interrupt me when I talk.

51:16.834 --> 51:19.167
If I talk too fast, you won't understand!

51:19.751 --> 51:21.209
Where was I?

51:21.626 --> 51:23.167
Moral principle.

51:23.167 --> 51:28.084
I once brought 3 Mainlanders

51:28.084 --> 51:32.084
to a showdown with the cops. Bang!

51:32.084 --> 51:35.001
One of them, Wei,
was so scared he dropped his gun!

51:35.001 --> 51:37.917
You know what? I rushed to save him!

51:37.917 --> 51:41.501
He owes me a lot.

51:42.292 --> 51:44.292
Know who Kun-xi is?

51:47.251 --> 51:48.876
Yip's former boss?

51:50.417 --> 51:53.459
Quincy is Wei's godson.

51:53.459 --> 51:54.917
Want to meet him?

51:56.001 --> 51:57.251
$1M!

51:59.126 --> 52:00.376
You better check him out thoroughly.

52:00.376 --> 52:02.334
Check me out? Motherfucker.

52:02.751 --> 52:04.334
It's just $1M.

52:04.917 --> 52:06.292
Act fast.

52:07.001 --> 52:09.084
Quincy will stand in front of you tomorrow.

52:09.084 --> 52:10.376
Give me the dough.

52:26.834 --> 52:27.834
Hey.

52:29.959 --> 52:31.584
Thanks so much!

52:32.584 --> 52:34.251
Let's go have some fun?

52:53.876 --> 52:57.084
Are you tight in cash lately, Taishan Boy?

52:57.084 --> 52:59.876
How can 3 pieces be enough?

53:09.501 --> 53:14.042
Guns are for firing, not for sniffing.

53:20.751 --> 53:24.167
Our commander taught us: safety first.

53:24.792 --> 53:30.167
Have you sniffed that Cheuk
is looking for Yip and Kwai?

53:31.417 --> 53:35.834
Mr Cheuk says he wants to meet those two.

53:36.501 --> 53:39.084
Look, he has set up a special phone line.

53:39.084 --> 53:41.626
Info for money.

53:41.626 --> 53:43.417
How generous!

53:45.167 --> 53:47.126
Both of them are very dangerous.

53:47.709 --> 53:50.667
Which kingpin is not dangerous?

53:50.667 --> 53:52.751
They are being so brazenly?

53:52.751 --> 53:54.417
The Handover is imminent.

53:54.417 --> 53:57.292
Because the Handover is imminent,
you have to do big!

53:57.292 --> 54:01.376
After the Handover,
it will be slim pickings, Idiot.

54:02.792 --> 54:04.167
Listen.

54:04.167 --> 54:05.542
Sniff out their whereabouts.

54:05.542 --> 54:09.251
The restoration of this
Association depends on you!

54:10.084 --> 54:14.209
Keep me posted, kiddo.

54:14.209 --> 54:16.959
Keep me posted!

54:30.584 --> 54:31.584
Stand still, sir.

54:31.584 --> 54:32.667
What's wrong?

54:32.667 --> 54:33.292
Where are you going?

54:33.292 --> 54:34.584
Home.

54:34.584 --> 54:36.001
Your ID, please.

54:43.417 --> 54:44.334
Bo!

54:44.334 --> 54:47.042
Why didn't you come home right after school?

54:47.042 --> 54:49.251
I told you so many times.

54:49.542 --> 54:51.084
Where have you been?

54:51.084 --> 54:53.501
We've been looking for you everywhere.

54:54.751 --> 54:57.459
Bro Coke, you should've told us beforehand.

54:57.459 --> 54:59.584
- I thought I was on my way.
- You've scared the hell out of us.

55:10.792 --> 55:12.417
Shut up!

55:14.042 --> 55:15.917
Still drinking? Bad girl!

55:15.917 --> 55:17.334
What happened?

55:19.876 --> 55:21.501
She's naughty.

55:21.501 --> 55:23.626
Teach your girl at home, not on the street.

55:23.626 --> 55:25.042
- I'm sorry.
- You've frightened her.

55:25.042 --> 55:27.417
Yes, I'm sorry.

55:27.959 --> 55:29.459
Let's go home.

55:30.209 --> 55:31.417
Thank you, sir.

55:46.126 --> 55:47.501
Sorry.

55:56.917 --> 55:58.209
Darling.

55:58.876 --> 56:00.292
Daddy loves you.

56:00.292 --> 56:01.334
My good girl.

56:03.792 --> 56:05.126
3 Days!

56:05.126 --> 56:08.751
Chief Song helped us recover the goods in 3 days.

56:08.751 --> 56:11.417
Chief Song, my buddy!

56:11.417 --> 56:12.542
You rock!

56:12.959 --> 56:19.459
It's incumbent on the police to maintain order.

56:19.459 --> 56:20.709
Boss Zhang,

56:20.917 --> 56:23.126
can you do me a favor?

56:29.667 --> 56:30.792
Go!

56:37.876 --> 56:39.792
Let him vent his anger.

56:40.584 --> 56:41.667
Stop!

56:56.834 --> 57:01.084
Chief Song, you're a tea connoisseur.

57:05.917 --> 57:07.459
Enough.

57:09.459 --> 57:11.251
I need you to do me a favor.

57:11.251 --> 57:12.751
What do you mean?

57:13.667 --> 57:18.209
They are the sons of my ex-commander's friend.

57:18.626 --> 57:20.709
Forgive them.

57:21.751 --> 57:23.751
Give me face.

57:27.834 --> 57:29.501
They robbed me.

57:30.959 --> 57:33.709
What have you lost?

57:35.042 --> 57:37.292
They robbed me! Me!

57:38.959 --> 57:41.084
We're good buddies.

57:41.084 --> 57:43.001
Who do you think you are?

57:43.001 --> 57:44.751
A petit bourgeois!

57:45.501 --> 57:49.917
A greedy, smuggling, tax-evading petit bourgeois!

57:50.751 --> 57:53.001
Don't think too highly of yourself.

57:53.001 --> 57:56.417
We're good buddies.

57:56.709 --> 57:58.251
Take them away!

57:59.251 --> 58:01.459
We're good buddies.

58:02.959 --> 58:04.417
Shoot him,

58:04.417 --> 58:06.709
I'll act according to the law!

58:22.834 --> 58:23.626
Great, there's a vase in the toilet...

58:23.626 --> 58:24.667
We're lucky...

58:24.667 --> 58:26.334
It's small but it will do.

58:55.417 --> 58:57.584
We're good buddies.

59:23.376 --> 59:25.667
RMB¥2M, thank you!

59:25.667 --> 59:27.084
I receive RMB¥1.3M from you. Thanks.

59:27.084 --> 59:28.292
I'll notify you once we have the goods.

59:28.292 --> 59:29.501
Next.

59:29.501 --> 59:30.876
Take your time.

59:30.876 --> 59:32.417
It's insane!

59:32.417 --> 59:34.626
Everyone out.

59:34.626 --> 59:36.917
Get out!

59:37.126 --> 59:39.459
It's insane!

59:39.459 --> 59:40.376
What happened?

59:40.376 --> 59:42.834
Bro Foon, Cheuk has gone mad!

59:42.834 --> 59:45.917
He set up a special phone line to look for you.

01:00:01.209 --> 01:00:02.709
Inspector Wu.

01:00:03.084 --> 01:00:05.334
You're difficult to tail.

01:00:05.334 --> 01:00:07.001
I had to wait here for you!

01:00:07.459 --> 01:00:08.792
I caught this guy for you.

01:00:08.792 --> 01:00:11.959
He said you gave him $1M for Kun-xi's whereabouts.

01:00:14.501 --> 01:00:15.792
Is it a crime to look for someone?

01:00:15.792 --> 01:00:17.917
No.

01:00:17.917 --> 01:00:19.751
But have you checked him out?

01:00:19.751 --> 01:00:22.042
He's been in jail for 20 years.

01:00:22.042 --> 01:00:24.792
The phone numbers back then only had 6 digits!

01:00:24.792 --> 01:00:25.959
He's out of touch now!

01:00:25.959 --> 01:00:26.834
Out of touch?

01:00:26.834 --> 01:00:29.251
If I go to China, Wei will pick me up!

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:30.209
Wei?

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:32.001
He was shot dead two years ago!

01:00:32.001 --> 01:00:33.959
Kun-xi betrayed him!

01:00:34.667 --> 01:00:35.751
Have you been conned?

01:00:35.751 --> 01:00:37.501
I can arrest him now if you have.

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.501
An eye for an eye.

01:00:39.501 --> 01:00:40.417
That's moral principle.

01:00:40.417 --> 01:00:41.417
Calm down!

01:00:41.417 --> 01:00:43.167
I'm very calm.

01:00:43.792 --> 01:00:46.042
Or I'd have kicked you too!

01:00:49.584 --> 01:00:51.126
Want to report the crime?

01:00:51.501 --> 01:00:53.876
If not, I'll let him go.

01:00:54.667 --> 01:00:55.709
Well?

01:00:58.876 --> 01:01:01.917
If not, I'll let him go!

01:01:01.917 --> 01:01:02.876
Get lost!

01:01:02.876 --> 01:01:04.042
- Are you assaulting a police officer?
- Don't play tricks.

01:01:04.042 --> 01:01:06.167
So what? Motherfucker!

01:01:06.501 --> 01:01:07.792
Don't give up,

01:01:07.792 --> 01:01:09.251
keep searching for him.

01:01:09.251 --> 01:01:13.959
The Royal Hong Kong Police relies
on your phone calls.

01:01:22.959 --> 01:01:24.709
Why don't you just drop it?

01:01:25.251 --> 01:01:28.667
Don't ruin your impeccable record.

01:01:30.334 --> 01:01:32.251
I'd help you if I could!

01:01:33.334 --> 01:01:34.709
Even if you were to hit me,

01:01:34.709 --> 01:01:38.251
I must say it's a dead end!

01:01:43.209 --> 01:01:45.084
I know, I know!

01:01:45.417 --> 01:01:47.459
We've come to the climax of tonight.

01:01:47.459 --> 01:01:49.084
The last leg of the Triple Trio.

01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:53.126
The $170M jackpot pool.

01:01:53.126 --> 01:01:56.584
Plus the total bet amount. A single winner

01:01:56.584 --> 01:01:59.584
can collect over $300M.

01:01:59.584 --> 01:02:02.626
Many horse racing fans are placing bets.

01:02:02.626 --> 01:02:03.959
The whole city is abuzz!

01:02:03.959 --> 01:02:06.501
A single winning ticket will make
you richer than any kings.

01:02:06.501 --> 01:02:08.001
See if you can win.

01:02:08.001 --> 01:02:12.709
Bets are placed on Wind Chaser.

01:02:13.084 --> 01:02:14.292
Gold Weather is the horse least expected to win.

01:02:14.292 --> 01:02:17.959
The odds are 99.

01:02:18.834 --> 01:02:20.417
Win & Place.

01:02:23.959 --> 01:02:27.209
Motherfucker, almost $400M in the pool.

01:02:27.834 --> 01:02:30.667
Hong Kong citizens are robbed by the Triple Trio.

01:02:32.084 --> 01:02:34.334
What does Triple Trio mean?

01:02:35.542 --> 01:02:39.042
The $170M jackpot pool

01:02:39.042 --> 01:02:41.126
has attracted many fans queuing
to place their bets.

01:03:01.876 --> 01:03:02.626
No more clothes pegs?

01:03:02.626 --> 01:03:03.334
No.

01:03:03.334 --> 01:03:04.167
Go get some in the room.

01:03:04.167 --> 01:03:05.376
Sure.

01:04:02.001 --> 01:04:04.001
The race is about to start.

01:04:04.001 --> 01:04:07.001
The $170M jackpot pool.

01:04:07.001 --> 01:04:08.251
A single winner

01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:10.084
can collect over $300M!

01:04:10.209 --> 01:04:12.126
Who will be the lucky one?

01:04:12.209 --> 01:04:14.209
A dark horse will increase the size

01:04:14.209 --> 01:04:16.001
of the betting pool.

01:04:16.251 --> 01:04:18.834
The horses are in the stalls and ready to go.

01:04:18.834 --> 01:04:20.626
Which horse will take off first?

01:04:20.626 --> 01:04:22.834
It's Wind Chaser.

01:04:22.834 --> 01:04:24.626
It runs faster and faster.

01:04:24.626 --> 01:04:25.917
The rest can hardly catch up.

01:04:25.917 --> 01:04:29.167
Go! Go! Go!

01:04:32.376 --> 01:04:39.417
Faster! Faster! Faster!

01:04:42.667 --> 01:04:46.251
No one wins. The warehouse
must be filled with money.

01:05:07.501 --> 01:05:08.751
Big Bro Chiu.

01:06:57.334 --> 01:06:58.001
Hey.

01:06:58.001 --> 01:07:01.709
Mr Cheuk, you know who Kun-xi is?

01:07:02.209 --> 01:07:04.501
It's Kun-xi speaking.

01:07:04.501 --> 01:07:08.709
Look me up in Guangdong. I won't let you down.

01:07:19.959 --> 01:07:23.334
You're really quitting? It's a cushy job.

01:07:23.334 --> 01:07:24.751
You're telling me!

01:07:26.001 --> 01:07:27.626
Talk to Big Bro yourself.

01:07:28.709 --> 01:07:33.959
I have invested all I got in the goods.

01:07:39.209 --> 01:07:42.751
You already know all those officials

01:07:42.751 --> 01:07:44.751
and connections well...

01:07:44.917 --> 01:07:46.334
What did you say?

01:07:47.834 --> 01:07:49.209
Fisherman!

01:07:49.209 --> 01:07:50.584
Yes, Bro Foon.

01:07:52.876 --> 01:07:54.667
Give me Cheuk's number.

01:07:55.917 --> 01:07:57.167
Bro Foon.

01:07:57.167 --> 01:07:58.834
You got something to say?

01:07:58.834 --> 01:08:00.209
No.

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:01.709
Give me the number!

01:08:01.709 --> 01:08:03.042
Sure.

01:08:11.709 --> 01:08:15.834
Fuck! Thought I would be famous overnight.

01:08:16.251 --> 01:08:17.667
What a waste of time!

01:08:19.917 --> 01:08:21.792
Fame is not an issue.

01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:24.751
I can't just go back empty-handed.

01:08:24.751 --> 01:08:26.876
Not to mention having to chew this bread here.

01:08:35.084 --> 01:08:36.626
Big Bro Chiu,

01:08:36.626 --> 01:08:39.001
coming to Hong Kong has not been easy for us.

01:08:39.001 --> 01:08:42.167
We can't just go back like this.

01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:53.167
Big Bro Chiu, you really want us to leave?

01:08:56.959 --> 01:08:59.042
If you guys have something big in mind,

01:08:59.042 --> 01:09:00.917
count us in!

01:09:00.917 --> 01:09:02.917
We can do anything.

01:09:06.251 --> 01:09:07.917
I can keep a secret.

01:09:07.917 --> 01:09:10.376
If you say you're Big Bro Chiu, then so be it.

01:09:10.376 --> 01:09:12.751
I understand. Don't worry.

01:09:13.084 --> 01:09:16.792
I know the rules. It's between you and me.

01:09:17.251 --> 01:09:19.376
We have moral principle.

01:09:33.167 --> 01:09:34.417
Share it.

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.626
Seriously, we can make it work.

01:09:49.626 --> 01:09:51.209
The 3 Kings of Thieves join forces...

01:10:27.917 --> 01:10:32.334
Mind your own business.

01:11:00.834 --> 01:11:02.834
Aren't you on dialysis? Still smoking?

01:11:06.251 --> 01:11:08.792
Old habits die hard.

01:11:12.751 --> 01:11:14.959
Are you still angry with me?

01:11:14.959 --> 01:11:17.667
You're planning to rob the gold shop downstairs?

01:11:23.376 --> 01:11:25.584
I thought you're paying me a visit.

01:11:26.167 --> 01:11:28.084
You're here just for the location.

01:11:29.501 --> 01:11:30.167
Listen to me...

01:11:30.167 --> 01:11:31.251
No more!

01:11:31.251 --> 01:11:31.709
Listen to me...

01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:33.167
I treat you as my brother. You treat me as a fool!

01:11:33.167 --> 01:11:33.792
I never treat you as a fool.

01:11:33.792 --> 01:11:35.959
Forget it! Just shut up!

01:11:37.792 --> 01:11:40.334
I have a wife and a daughter now.

01:11:40.876 --> 01:11:43.209
My life is great.

01:11:43.209 --> 01:11:45.751
Can you leave my family alone?

01:11:58.001 --> 01:11:59.792
I'm in the wrong this time.

01:12:04.917 --> 01:12:07.417
You know it's hard to make a living.

01:12:16.501 --> 01:12:18.251
We're sworn brothers.

01:12:19.792 --> 01:12:21.626
I owe you this time.

01:12:24.876 --> 01:12:27.792
Forget what happened these past few days.

01:12:28.876 --> 01:12:30.584
Keep it to yourself.

01:12:52.751 --> 01:12:54.376
I'll leave early tomorrow morning.

01:12:54.667 --> 01:12:56.626
You won't see me again.

01:13:16.501 --> 01:13:17.751
Uncle Coke.

01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:22.126
Not in bed yet?

01:13:35.417 --> 01:13:38.084
Guangdong province

01:13:45.834 --> 01:13:49.917
Sai Wan Container Terminal, Hong Kong

01:14:56.209 --> 01:14:57.334
Mr Cheuk,

01:14:57.334 --> 01:14:59.126
I've heard so much about you.

01:15:03.084 --> 01:15:04.334
Where's Yip?

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:07.792
Let me show you something.

01:15:07.792 --> 01:15:09.084
This way.

01:15:11.792 --> 01:15:14.751
Mr Cheuk. How's your journey?

01:15:14.751 --> 01:15:16.959
I'll treat you to something special.

01:15:16.959 --> 01:15:19.834
Shrimps and crabs are local specialties.

01:15:19.834 --> 01:15:23.126
After food we'll find two shampoo girls for you.

01:15:23.126 --> 01:15:25.167
This way, please.

01:15:26.959 --> 01:15:30.584
Type 54 pistols, grenades, AK weapons.

01:15:30.584 --> 01:15:32.292
I've got all you want.

01:15:32.542 --> 01:15:33.959
Where's Yip?

01:15:35.876 --> 01:15:39.334
The truck outside holds a ton of dynamite.

01:15:40.042 --> 01:15:41.584
Bang!

01:15:41.584 --> 01:15:43.084
You can blow up whatever you want.

01:15:44.126 --> 01:15:46.042
Where's Yip?

01:15:51.417 --> 01:15:53.251
They were all retired soldiers.

01:15:53.251 --> 01:15:54.834
They're fearless veterans in battles!

01:15:54.834 --> 01:15:56.542
I want Yip!

01:16:01.834 --> 01:16:03.084
Coin!

01:16:10.167 --> 01:16:11.292
Give it to me!

01:16:15.876 --> 01:16:18.542
Big Bro, let's think it through.

01:16:18.542 --> 01:16:20.042
Give it to me!

01:16:20.626 --> 01:16:21.542
We're doing all right.

01:16:21.542 --> 01:16:23.584
Why go back to our old business?

01:16:24.542 --> 01:16:25.667
Are you lecturing me?

01:16:25.667 --> 01:16:27.584
We're making money!

01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:29.334
We can't be robbers for the rest of our lives!

01:16:29.334 --> 01:16:31.209
You do it!

01:16:31.209 --> 01:16:32.959
You have struck a deal with the Fisherman!

01:16:34.126 --> 01:16:36.459
Big Bro, he was just thinking out loud.

01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:37.792
Leave if you want!

01:16:37.792 --> 01:16:39.126
I won't stop you!

01:16:39.126 --> 01:16:41.084
Do you know what time it is? You don't sleep?

01:16:41.084 --> 01:16:42.959
Go fuck yourself!

01:16:44.501 --> 01:16:45.959
Fuck you!

01:16:45.959 --> 01:16:46.876
Come down!

01:17:02.167 --> 01:17:04.376
Yip has retired!

01:17:04.376 --> 01:17:06.084
He used to be my man!

01:17:06.084 --> 01:17:07.167
Am I not a better partner?

01:17:07.167 --> 01:17:09.459
Who the hell are you?

01:17:14.334 --> 01:17:15.084
Hello?

01:17:15.084 --> 01:17:16.917
Hello, Cheuk.

01:17:16.917 --> 01:17:18.792
It's Yip Kwok-foon speaking.

01:17:22.126 --> 01:17:23.209
Are you kidding me?

01:17:24.042 --> 01:17:25.709
Why should I believe you?

01:17:25.709 --> 01:17:27.834
I am who I am!

01:17:27.834 --> 01:17:29.542
If you don't believe me, let's meet up!

01:17:30.876 --> 01:17:32.334
Wait. Got another call.

01:17:32.334 --> 01:17:33.001
Fuck you!

01:17:33.001 --> 01:17:34.417
Wait for what? Hello?

01:17:34.959 --> 01:17:35.667
Hello?

01:17:35.959 --> 01:17:36.792
Hey!

01:17:37.251 --> 01:17:37.876
Hey!

01:17:42.001 --> 01:17:43.084
You are dead!

01:17:43.501 --> 01:17:44.751
Go up!

01:17:44.917 --> 01:17:46.001
Go up!

01:17:48.209 --> 01:17:49.167
Hello?

01:17:49.792 --> 01:17:51.001
Speak!

01:17:51.542 --> 01:17:53.209
Are you Cheuk?

01:17:54.042 --> 01:17:55.001
Who's speaking?

01:18:01.042 --> 01:18:02.501
Kwai Ching-hung.

01:18:04.959 --> 01:18:06.542
Need my help?

01:18:07.959 --> 01:18:09.542
Are you kidding me?

01:18:11.292 --> 01:18:13.334
Do you have any proof?

01:18:14.251 --> 01:18:17.084
I robbed Tung Shing Watch in 1986.

01:18:17.876 --> 01:18:19.376
I killed 3 plainclothes

01:18:19.376 --> 01:18:21.042
in 1988.

01:18:21.334 --> 01:18:22.626
And Landmark in 1992...

01:18:23.876 --> 01:18:27.459
Wasn't it Yip who robbed Landmark in 1992!

01:18:29.876 --> 01:18:31.959
Don't be so gullible.

01:18:32.584 --> 01:18:36.084
Jumbo Watch in 1994
and Lucky Guy Jewellery two years ago.

01:18:36.084 --> 01:18:37.834
I did them all.

01:18:37.834 --> 01:18:39.876
Do you think only Yip had AK-47?

01:18:39.876 --> 01:18:42.584
He loved to be on camera
and the cops were dumb.

01:18:42.584 --> 01:18:45.792
- I just took advantage of the situation...
- Hold on! Don't hang up.

01:18:58.334 --> 01:18:59.667
What did you just say?

01:18:59.667 --> 01:19:00.501
Fuck you!

01:19:00.501 --> 01:19:01.251
Are you playing me?

01:19:03.417 --> 01:19:06.251
It's you, Yip!

01:19:08.459 --> 01:19:11.626
Landmark in 1992, Jumbo in 1994,
and Lucky Guy two years ago.

01:19:11.626 --> 01:19:12.459
Are you responsible for all?

01:19:12.459 --> 01:19:13.501
No!

01:19:13.501 --> 01:19:14.501
I never did my jobs in clandestine!

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:17.292
Why should I hide myself?

01:19:52.584 --> 01:19:53.542
We're all here.

01:19:53.792 --> 01:19:54.751
Where are you right now?

01:19:54.751 --> 01:19:56.126
Hong Kong!

01:19:57.417 --> 01:19:59.292
I'll call you when I'm back in Hong Kong.

01:20:22.792 --> 01:20:23.792
Hello?

01:20:27.042 --> 01:20:28.042
Hello?

01:20:33.376 --> 01:20:34.542
Hello?

01:20:34.542 --> 01:20:36.626
Kwai Ching-hung, you still there?

01:20:37.292 --> 01:20:37.917
Hello?

01:20:37.917 --> 01:20:38.584
Yes.

01:20:39.417 --> 01:20:40.917
Where are you?

01:20:43.709 --> 01:20:44.626
Hong Kong.

01:20:49.459 --> 01:20:51.417
Call you when I'm back in Hong Kong.

01:20:51.417 --> 01:20:52.626
Let's talk later.

01:21:03.334 --> 01:21:04.876
Motherfucker! The 3 Kings

01:21:04.876 --> 01:21:06.209
of Thieves have nothing to do with you.

01:21:06.876 --> 01:21:08.542
Since you're here,

01:21:09.584 --> 01:21:11.626
you can't bail without leaving something.

01:21:16.834 --> 01:21:18.001
Yes.

01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:41.751
There's less than $10M here.

01:21:42.501 --> 01:21:44.376
Mr Cheuk's life

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:48.584
worth at least $100M!

01:22:00.542 --> 01:22:01.542
Put your guns down!

01:22:04.251 --> 01:22:06.626
Retired soldiers? Go!

01:22:11.917 --> 01:22:13.042
Car key.

01:22:13.751 --> 01:22:15.042
Car key!

01:22:29.584 --> 01:22:31.584
You think I'm bullshitting?

01:22:33.501 --> 01:22:35.417
If you don't treat me as your Big Bro,
let's split!

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:38.376
Big Bro, we always follow your orders.

01:22:38.376 --> 01:22:40.501
You said "drop the guns," we dropped the guns.

01:22:40.501 --> 01:22:41.459
Is that very hard for you?

01:22:41.459 --> 01:22:43.751
No, we always follow you, Big Bro.

01:22:43.751 --> 01:22:45.501
We support you no matter what!

01:22:49.417 --> 01:22:50.917
Are you looking down on me?

01:22:51.251 --> 01:22:53.126
I stoop so low that I need your support?

01:22:53.626 --> 01:22:54.917
I don't need you!

01:22:54.917 --> 01:22:56.751
You're just my followers!

01:22:59.167 --> 01:23:00.709
Hey you!

01:23:02.209 --> 01:23:03.501
What are you fighting for?

01:23:03.501 --> 01:23:06.667
Sorry, we're tourists.

01:23:06.667 --> 01:23:10.459
We got lost, so we quarreled.

01:23:10.459 --> 01:23:12.417
The residents upstairs filed a complaint.

01:23:13.376 --> 01:23:14.959
- Where are your IDs?
- Here.

01:23:23.167 --> 01:23:26.167
We planned to take a boat to Macau

01:23:26.959 --> 01:23:28.376
but got lost here.

01:23:28.376 --> 01:23:30.001
We couldn't find the pier.

01:23:30.001 --> 01:23:33.001
So we quarreled.

01:23:35.584 --> 01:23:36.751
Call the station.

01:23:37.542 --> 01:23:40.209
PC1844 calling the station. Send.

01:23:45.501 --> 01:23:47.584
Quick!

01:23:47.584 --> 01:23:49.376
Don't let him flee!

01:23:49.376 --> 01:23:50.751
Motherfucker!

01:23:51.834 --> 01:23:53.751
He's in the front!

01:23:54.292 --> 01:23:55.501
Go after him!

01:24:22.167 --> 01:24:24.126
Hello? Uncle Dog, I've found them.

01:24:24.417 --> 01:24:26.792
Believe it or not, they called me up!

01:24:26.792 --> 01:24:28.334
I even got a whole ton of dynamite!

01:24:28.334 --> 01:24:30.501
It will work this time. Get me a boat.

01:24:30.501 --> 01:24:32.667
I have an idea!

01:24:32.667 --> 01:24:34.042
We'll blow up the Handover ceremony!

01:24:34.042 --> 01:24:36.042
We can threaten either the British queen
or the Chinese government.

01:24:36.042 --> 01:24:38.042
It will create a stir for sure!

01:24:38.042 --> 01:24:39.292
What the fuck!

01:25:27.417 --> 01:25:28.751
The night snack is here. Back yet?

01:25:28.751 --> 01:25:29.626
Coming back.

01:25:29.667 --> 01:25:31.959
We're at the entrance
to the complainant's building.

01:25:32.334 --> 01:25:35.167
It's quiet. No one's here. OVER.

01:25:36.584 --> 01:25:39.876
Be civilized. Don't talk too loud.

01:25:39.876 --> 01:25:42.376
If you go to Macau, take the ferry in Sheung Wan.

01:25:42.834 --> 01:25:44.084
This is Sai Wan.

01:25:44.084 --> 01:25:44.959
Oh.

01:25:45.376 --> 01:25:48.042
Go to the main street and take a cab.

01:25:48.334 --> 01:25:49.167
Take a cab!

01:25:53.876 --> 01:25:56.501
Mainlanders are numskulls.

01:28:36.167 --> 01:28:37.292
Quick!

01:28:45.292 --> 01:28:46.876
Mainlanders?

01:28:47.501 --> 01:28:49.334
I'm Yip Kwok-foon!

01:30:01.584 --> 01:30:04.334
Military Police

01:31:26.084 --> 01:31:26.959
Waiter.

01:31:28.001 --> 01:31:29.876
Sir, have you reserved a table?

01:31:29.876 --> 01:31:31.417
I booked a room under the name of Chen.

01:31:31.417 --> 01:31:33.542
Give me a second.

01:31:34.876 --> 01:31:38.042
Mr Chen. Please follow me.

01:31:38.459 --> 01:31:39.751
This way, please.

01:31:39.751 --> 01:31:40.792
Hey.

01:31:40.792 --> 01:31:41.584
Where is our rice?

01:31:41.584 --> 01:31:42.917
Rice? Give me a second.

01:31:42.917 --> 01:31:44.751
Your rice is coming right away.

01:31:47.251 --> 01:31:49.167
Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:31:49.167 --> 01:31:50.376
Thank you.

01:31:50.376 --> 01:31:51.834
Enjoy your food.

01:31:52.334 --> 01:31:54.042
Mr Chen. This way, please.

01:31:54.667 --> 01:31:57.209
Hey! Haven't you gone to the bathroom just now?

01:31:57.209 --> 01:32:01.001
Wait! Don't puke!

01:32:01.542 --> 01:32:03.834
Are you all right?

01:32:03.834 --> 01:32:06.876
I thought you went to the restroom.
Why are you here?

01:32:07.417 --> 01:32:08.751
I'm sorry. This way, please.

01:32:08.751 --> 01:32:10.084
We are super busy today.

01:32:10.084 --> 01:32:11.292
- Hey!
- This way, please.

01:32:11.292 --> 01:32:12.792
The rice is cold!

01:32:13.084 --> 01:32:14.126
Give me a second.

01:32:14.126 --> 01:32:15.792
- I'm sorry. The rice is cold?
- I want tea.

01:32:15.792 --> 01:32:17.001
Give me a second. I'll give you another bowl.

01:32:17.001 --> 01:32:18.459
- Quick!
- Tell me the room number. I'll look for it myself.

01:32:18.459 --> 01:32:20.709
- I want tea.
- Give me a second.

01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:21.542
Sure I'll get you tea.

01:32:21.542 --> 01:32:24.334
Give me a second. I'll be right back.

01:32:29.376 --> 01:32:31.626
We should not forget you.

01:32:31.626 --> 01:32:35.126
And we should watch with the closest interests

01:32:35.126 --> 01:32:40.917
as you embark on this new era
of your remarkable history.
