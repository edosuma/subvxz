00:33.566 --> 00:35.267
What's this?

00:36.703 --> 00:38.404
It's none of your business.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.839
What, think you're gonna be
the next Madonna?

00:40.841 --> 00:42.474
What do you know?

00:42.476 --> 00:44.810
Maybe people actually
want to hear me sing.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.478
Who? As soon as you
get up on that stage

00:46.480 --> 00:47.746
and look out at the audience,

00:47.748 --> 00:49.314
you'll realize the truth, Emma.

00:49.316 --> 00:53.986
You're just like
the rest of us... all alone.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.613
Did you decide which one?

01:21.615 --> 01:23.715
Not yet.
I have narrowed it down to two,

01:23.717 --> 01:25.284
but neither one
feels exactly right.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.453
Well, Emma, I didn't want
to say anything because

01:27.455 --> 01:29.521
I wasn't sure that
the curse even brought it over

01:29.523 --> 01:32.357
from the enchanted forest,
but I had belle scour

01:32.359 --> 01:36.695
the back of gold's shop,
and she found it.

01:36.697 --> 01:39.932
My wedding dress!

01:39.934 --> 01:41.033
Do you want to wear it?

01:41.035 --> 01:43.435
Of course. Where is it?

01:43.437 --> 01:44.770
Well, I dropped it off
at the dry cleaner,

01:44.772 --> 01:46.705
and it should be back in plenty
of time for the wedding tonight.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.540
Mom, that's...

01:48.542 --> 01:50.209
Thank you!

01:53.947 --> 01:55.114
With all we've
been through lately,

01:55.116 --> 01:59.318
I just never thought
we'd get a moment like this.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.754
Snow, snow,
it's going to be okay.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.389
No, charming, it's not!

02:04.391 --> 02:05.924
You heard rumple.

02:05.926 --> 02:08.127
There is nothing we can do
to stop the evil queen.

02:08.128 --> 02:11.430
I promise you, we will find
a way to protect our daughter.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.065
But right now, she needs
something more important.

02:13.067 --> 02:15.767
She needs her mother to rest.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.769
All right.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.738
I just need some air.

02:27.514 --> 02:30.682
I wish we had what
we needed to help Emma

02:30.684 --> 02:33.318
to give her a chance
at a happy ending.

05:48.948 --> 05:50.382
It's here!

05:55.154 --> 05:57.189
Wow.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.192
Mom!

06:00.194 --> 06:01.760
It's beautiful.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.736
Mom?

06:12.172 --> 06:14.740
I never was a fan
of white weddings.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.308
How are you still here?

06:16.310 --> 06:19.344
Did you really think you could
turn my own son against me?

06:19.346 --> 06:20.979
What the hell
are you doing here?

06:20.981 --> 06:22.347
Why are you crashing
my daughter's wedding day?

06:22.349 --> 06:25.650
Because Emma and I
are destined to fight.

06:25.652 --> 06:29.421
Light and dark must
have their reckoning.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.056
Unless, of course...

06:31.058 --> 06:32.190
What?

06:32.192 --> 06:34.025
Unless you give me
your heart now

06:34.027 --> 06:36.895
and save us both the trouble
of fighting the final battle.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.697
You really think
I'll just surrender to you.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.199
I know you think
you're strong, Emma.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.535
But I've spent centuries
collecting orphans

06:43.537 --> 06:46.004
just like you.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.073
And we both know deep down,

06:48.075 --> 06:51.109
you're still the lonely
little girl you always were.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.011
I hate to break it to you,
but I've grown up.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.046
Have you? Go to the clock tower.

06:55.048 --> 06:57.949
Then you'll know
what your up against.

06:57.951 --> 07:01.286
The final battle is coming,
whether you want it or not.

07:12.565 --> 07:14.032
Is that all...

07:14.034 --> 07:16.067
Black fairy dust.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.970
Enough to curse storybrooke
10 times over.

07:18.972 --> 07:21.273
So, that's how the black fairy
plans to win the final battle...

07:21.275 --> 07:24.643
By separating us with a curse.

07:24.645 --> 07:28.079
It's tied to the clock tower.

07:28.081 --> 07:31.983
The moment it strikes 6:00,
it'll be released.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.653
That's when hook and I
are getting married.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.955
Well, you have to admit, she's
got a flair for the dramatic.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.157
That's it. The black fairy's
going down right now.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.392
Emma, I know that
you feel responsible,

07:40.394 --> 07:42.127
but this is not just your fight.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.595
She seemed to think it was.

07:43.597 --> 07:46.398
Yeah, well the last time I
checked, she doesn't get a vote.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.935
Zelena and I will figure out
a way to disable this thing.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.471
I ruined your parents' wedding.

07:52.473 --> 07:56.007
The least I can do make sure
you get to enjoy yours.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.602
Enough!

09:30.604 --> 09:34.005
So, the charming's think
their love is strong enough

09:34.007 --> 09:35.574
to defeat me.

09:35.576 --> 09:40.111
Well, there's
one thing they don't know.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.621
What's wrong?

11:29.623 --> 11:33.625
Wishing they had something
with a bit more... Leather?

11:33.627 --> 11:36.394
Do you think Emma will be
disappointed if I don't wear it?

11:36.396 --> 11:37.962
I don't think she'll mind.

11:37.964 --> 11:39.064
Emma.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.899
Swan, don't you know
it's bad luck

11:40.901 --> 11:42.133
to see the bride
before the wedding?

11:42.135 --> 11:43.668
Dad, can you give us a minute?

11:43.670 --> 11:44.969
Yeah, of course.

11:48.574 --> 11:50.475
What is it, luv?

11:50.477 --> 11:53.378
The black fairy.
Gold didn't banish her.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.413
And now she's casting a curse
that's going to separate me

11:55.415 --> 11:58.883
from everyone, so that I have to
fight the final battle alone.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.485
Not on our wedding day,
she won't. Let's go.

12:00.487 --> 12:03.455
Killian, this is one
I need to win on my own.

12:06.325 --> 12:08.093
Isn't that what she wants?

12:08.095 --> 12:09.894
If you come with me,
it just gives her a chance

12:09.896 --> 12:11.596
to hurt one more person I love.

12:11.598 --> 12:14.566
And I can't let her do that.

12:14.568 --> 12:15.900
You've obviously
made up your mind,

12:15.902 --> 12:17.235
so why did you come here then?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.404
To tell you not to worry.

12:19.406 --> 12:23.441
And at 6:00 P.M., I will
be there to say "I do."

12:23.443 --> 12:25.310
No, that's not it.

12:30.082 --> 12:34.119
You've come to say goodbye
in case it doesn't work.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.053
Killian...

12:35.055 --> 12:37.622
Let me help.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.124
I love you.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.073
You think
the wish affected them?

12:55.075 --> 12:57.809
I don't know.
Only one way to find out.

12:57.811 --> 13:00.645
You there, pirate.

13:00.647 --> 13:03.081
Are you the captain of a ship
called the jolly Roger?

13:03.083 --> 13:05.383
Really? It's very kind
of you to ask.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.252
I always thought
I exuded authority.

13:07.254 --> 13:10.789
He's not the captain.

13:10.791 --> 13:13.324
<i>I am.</i>

13:13.326 --> 13:16.327
Allow me to introduce myself.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.796
Captain hook.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.230
We need you to take us
to the evil queen

13:19.232 --> 13:20.632
so we can save our daughter.

13:20.634 --> 13:22.400
We're prepared
to pay you for this journey.

13:23.737 --> 13:26.070
It's just a taste.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.505
So what do you say, pirate?

13:27.507 --> 13:30.275
Silver? Gold?

13:30.277 --> 13:32.443
Jewels?

14:07.981 --> 14:10.181
Revenge? On who?

14:10.183 --> 14:13.518
Just wait for
the second verse, luv.

14:48.154 --> 14:50.021
- Let's go.
- Wait, you want revenge

14:50.023 --> 14:52.190
on a crocodile
for taking your hand?

14:52.192 --> 14:55.860
Yeah, afraid
he did more than that.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.219
Wait.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.453
Did you say the dark one?

15:22.455 --> 15:24.222
I think I know
why you can't find him.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.523
We have him in our dungeon.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.691
Bloody hell.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.726
Captain, if you give us
safe passage

15:28.728 --> 15:31.129
to the queen's castle,
you've got yourself a crocodile.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.431
Aye, luv. You got a deal.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.266
Have on last drink, mates!

15:35.268 --> 15:37.735
Then we've got
a date with destiny!

16:06.666 --> 16:08.666
Show yourself, dark one.

16:12.404 --> 16:14.806
It takes a brave man to
walk into my shop like that.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.442
You betrayed Emma.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.177
You betrayed all of us.

16:19.179 --> 16:23.281
I simply did what was necessary
to keep my family together.

16:23.283 --> 16:26.250
Not that I'd expect a pirate
like you to understand.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.219
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

16:32.959 --> 16:36.160
A little bit of dreamshade
I brought back from neverland.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.197
I think it almost
killed you once before.

16:39.199 --> 16:43.334
But it didn't, as I'm immortal.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.769
Well, I don't need
to kill you now.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.271
Just, you know,
knock you out long enough

16:47.273 --> 16:49.707
for Emma to defeat your mother.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.110
And then...

16:52.112 --> 16:54.779
I'm gonna finally
skin myself a crocodile.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.883
There's just one problem.

16:58.885 --> 17:02.453
My son's not the only one
looking out for his family.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.001
- Mom.
- Hey.

17:17.002 --> 17:18.169
Let me guess, you're
here to talk me out of

17:18.171 --> 17:19.971
going up against
the black fairy.

17:19.973 --> 17:21.672
No.

17:21.674 --> 17:24.575
I'm here to tell you
you're doing the right thing.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.376
Really?

17:25.377 --> 17:27.377
The final battle...

17:27.380 --> 17:29.981
It's why I brought you to
storybrooke in the first place.

17:29.983 --> 17:33.351
I know you can do it.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.553
Thanks, kid.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.355
Well, what are you doing here?

17:37.357 --> 17:39.857
Well, I can't go into battle
with the people I love,

17:39.859 --> 17:44.062
so I was just reminding myself

17:44.064 --> 17:45.997
of all the things
I have to fight for.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.770
What's this?

18:00.212 --> 18:01.612
Are you okay?

18:01.614 --> 18:03.214
What was that?

18:03.216 --> 18:06.384
Nothing.

18:06.386 --> 18:09.287
If I'm gonna do this,
I need to do this now.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.622
I don't have a lot of time
before her curse hits.

18:26.138 --> 18:29.373
I can't find anything to stop
the black fairy's curse.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.975
Think about it.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.277
You were the first person
to cast her original dark curse.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.746
You know her magic
better than anyone.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.415
There has to be something
you learned back then

18:37.417 --> 18:40.885
that you can use
against her this time.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.054
Time.

18:43.056 --> 18:44.922
That's it!

18:44.924 --> 18:48.326
The first curse stopped time.

18:48.328 --> 18:52.630
If I can isolate
that part of the spell,

18:52.632 --> 18:55.133
it'll stop the curse
from happening.

18:57.936 --> 19:01.072
Show yourself, dearie.

19:03.842 --> 19:05.409
The queen!

19:05.411 --> 19:08.946
The queen, the queen, the queen.

19:08.948 --> 19:12.083
It's the charmings.

19:12.085 --> 19:16.320
They cast a spell
so everyone breaks into song.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.690
They plan to use it
to stop my curse...

19:19.692 --> 19:22.026
The curse you gave me.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.428
Ha.

19:24.430 --> 19:27.832
Which means you're going
to tell me how to stop them.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.934
Now sing!

19:38.344 --> 19:41.546
Sorry, dearie.
Do you think the dark one sings?

19:41.548 --> 19:44.549
I'd rather gouge my eyes out
with a rusty fork.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.884
And I didn't chose you
to cast my curse

19:46.886 --> 19:48.219
so you could come crying to me

19:48.221 --> 19:49.687
at every itty-bitty
sign of trouble.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.222
Please.

19:51.224 --> 19:55.693
I'm the best student who ever
walked through your door.

19:55.695 --> 19:59.297
I wouldn't be
too sure about that.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.731
And what's that
supposed to mean?

20:00.733 --> 20:05.403
It means if you want to prove
I chose the right witch,

20:05.405 --> 20:07.038
go fix it.

22:11.531 --> 22:12.430
wait.

22:12.432 --> 22:14.131
Why just revel in her demise,

22:14.133 --> 22:16.834
when I can use it
to my advantage?

23:15.994 --> 23:17.495
Is that it?

23:17.497 --> 23:20.431
Yes, the answer to stopping
the black fairy's curse.

23:20.433 --> 23:22.566
Okay, now we'll fight
the black fairy together.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.601
Good work.

23:23.603 --> 23:26.504
Well, I had a little help.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.172
I wonder what
our sorry excuse of a teacher

23:28.174 --> 23:29.573
would say if he could
see us now?

23:29.575 --> 23:31.208
How about, "thank you"?

23:34.780 --> 23:39.116
Now, this was made
to freeze the curse.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.485
I wonder how well
it's gonna work on people.

23:45.290 --> 23:48.859
So, have you finally
come to your senses

23:48.861 --> 23:50.761
and decided to surrender?

23:50.763 --> 23:53.798
Hardly.
Why wait for the curse to hit?

23:53.800 --> 23:55.366
Let's start
the final battle now.

23:55.368 --> 23:59.703
Funny, I was thinking
the same thing.

24:03.208 --> 24:07.144
I was planning to wait
for my curse to separate you

24:07.146 --> 24:11.916
from your family, but they
ended up doing my work for me.

24:17.389 --> 24:18.622
I'll kill you.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.090
Will you, now?

24:20.092 --> 24:22.760
Because I've been
watching you, Emma.

24:22.762 --> 24:25.296
Or should I say, listening?

24:26.833 --> 24:29.333
Do you know what I hear?

24:29.335 --> 24:32.670
A little girl who's
all alone in this world.

24:32.672 --> 24:37.141
A girl who's weak, without hope.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.276
I used to go to sleep
to the sounds of misery

24:39.278 --> 24:43.013
like that every night
in the mines.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.882
I'll show you misery.

24:48.754 --> 24:50.154
What did you do?

24:50.156 --> 24:54.692
I didn't do anything,
just made you face the truth.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.327
You can't do this alone.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.640
What did she do to you?

25:09.642 --> 25:11.442
She just reminded me
what it was like

25:11.444 --> 25:17.214
to feel something I haven't
felt in a really long time.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.483
She reminded me what
it felt like to be alone.

25:19.485 --> 25:23.320
Even if she froze our family,
you're not alone.

25:23.322 --> 25:26.557
The reason... the reason
I didn't want to listen

25:26.559 --> 25:31.862
to the tape is because
it reminded me of a time

25:31.864 --> 25:34.331
when no one even cared enough
to listen to me sing a song.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.133
I don't understand.

25:36.135 --> 25:39.403
What does it have to do with
fighting the final battle?

25:39.405 --> 25:41.205
It's not about the singing.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.806
It's just where it started.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.842
It's not about the little things
that I couldn't do on my own.

25:44.844 --> 25:49.813
It was every time something big
came along, I ran from it.

25:53.051 --> 25:56.587
Henry, I wasn't even
brave enough to keep you.

25:56.589 --> 25:59.557
Mom.

25:59.559 --> 26:02.826
That was a long time ago.

26:02.828 --> 26:04.528
You've changed.

26:04.530 --> 26:07.531
Because you came into my life.

26:07.533 --> 26:09.233
And you helped me
build a family,

26:09.235 --> 26:11.669
and that let me do things
I never thought I could.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.370
You're the savior.

26:13.372 --> 26:17.341
You can still beat her
and save everyone.

26:21.546 --> 26:23.881
The only way I can do that
is if I give the black fairy

26:23.883 --> 26:26.183
my heart the way she wanted
in the first place.

26:26.185 --> 26:28.052
But she'll kill you.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.588
You brought me here to
bring back the happy endings.

26:30.590 --> 26:33.123
Maybe this is the way
I was supposed to do it.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.125
This isn't how the book's
supposed to end.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.460
Because if I fight and I lose,

26:36.462 --> 26:38.862
then I know
you won't have anyone.

26:38.864 --> 26:41.665
At least this way, I know you'll
have the rest of our family.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.272
In here.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.541
Where is she?

26:50.543 --> 26:53.611
Looking for me?

26:53.613 --> 26:56.046
Snow white.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.215
I haven't had a chance
to congratulate you

26:58.217 --> 27:00.818
on that little bundle
brewing inside.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.252
That's far enough.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.455
You should make it easy on
yourself and come with us now.

27:04.457 --> 27:07.992
You mean like this?

28:49.260 --> 28:51.595
There's a powerful magic...

28:53.865 --> 28:54.898
Snow, the song... it's gone.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.033
I don't understand.

28:56.035 --> 28:58.235
What's there to understand?

28:58.237 --> 29:00.003
I won.

29:00.005 --> 29:01.538
You took our song from us.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.073
Not just yours.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.942
Everyone's.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.710
How?

29:06.712 --> 29:09.079
With a little something
I happened to find in my vault.

29:09.081 --> 29:12.416
Green isn't my color, but it
seems to have done the trick.

29:12.418 --> 29:13.617
No!

29:16.622 --> 29:22.793
I guess this proves love isn't
the strongest magic of all.

29:22.795 --> 29:27.030
Enjoy what little time
you have left as a family.

29:32.637 --> 29:33.704
Snow, are you okay?

29:33.706 --> 29:36.373
What do you think?

29:36.375 --> 29:37.441
What happened?

29:37.443 --> 29:38.575
The wish should've worked.

29:38.577 --> 29:41.211
You felt how powerful
that song was.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.980
Snow, look.

29:51.589 --> 29:53.924
Blue.

29:53.926 --> 29:56.393
You granted the wish.

29:56.395 --> 29:57.427
But it didn't work.

29:57.429 --> 29:58.796
The evil queen took
the song from us.

29:58.798 --> 30:00.497
No one can do that.

30:00.499 --> 30:03.634
It's still inside you.
It's still inside everyone.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.803
But I'm afraid its magic
was never meant for you to use

30:05.805 --> 30:07.771
against the evil queen.

30:07.773 --> 30:10.040
Then, who was it for?

30:15.814 --> 30:18.248
Emma.

30:18.250 --> 30:21.118
You wished that she could have
a chance for a happy ending.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.988
And now, with everyone's song
in her heart, she will.

30:24.990 --> 30:27.191
I don't understand. Why?

30:27.193 --> 30:29.927
I mean, how does that help her?

30:29.929 --> 30:32.529
One day, she will face a battle

30:32.531 --> 30:34.765
like no one has
ever faced before.

30:34.767 --> 30:38.602
And I'm afraid she will
have to face it alone.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.971
But she won't be alone.

30:40.973 --> 30:42.840
She'll have the voices
of the people who love her

30:42.842 --> 30:45.609
inside of her heart.

30:45.611 --> 30:47.144
In the morning,
we'll have forgotten

30:47.146 --> 30:48.178
that we ever sang
in the first place.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.880
Not even the evil queen
will remember.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.682
That way, the songs
will remain safe.

30:51.684 --> 30:54.484
Then, how will Emma
know she has them inside her?

30:54.486 --> 30:56.453
We will just have to hope
that they find their way

30:56.455 --> 30:59.690
to the surface
when she needs them the most.

31:07.665 --> 31:11.034
There has to be a different
ending to this story.

31:12.503 --> 31:14.805
Aah!

31:24.916 --> 31:27.150
Where'd that come from?

31:40.098 --> 31:41.932
She's not alone.

31:43.768 --> 31:45.102
She never was.

31:50.275 --> 31:51.742
Emma.

31:51.744 --> 31:53.210
Here to spend a final moment

31:53.212 --> 31:55.345
with your family
before my curse hits?

31:55.347 --> 31:56.780
Just let them go.

31:56.782 --> 31:58.282
This could be over
before it even started.

31:58.284 --> 32:01.184
You could have
what you came for.

32:01.186 --> 32:02.519
My heart.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.154
It's a deal.

32:14.465 --> 32:16.166
Killian.

32:18.303 --> 32:21.038
I'm sorry. This is the only way.

32:32.317 --> 32:35.118
It's all right, Emma.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.455
At least one of us is
getting our happy ending.

32:38.457 --> 32:42.125
Just get it over with.

32:53.571 --> 32:55.072
No.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.507
Why won't you die?

33:01.579 --> 33:04.514
'Cause her heart's
stronger than you think.

33:04.516 --> 33:07.351
Henry, what are you doing here?

33:07.353 --> 33:09.987
You don't have to be afraid
of being alone

33:09.989 --> 33:11.421
because you never have been.

33:11.423 --> 33:14.524
Look. Their song has been
inside you the whole time.

33:14.526 --> 33:18.362
It's not your weakness.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.930
It's your strength.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.668
Mom, keep going. You can do it.

35:13.044 --> 35:15.378
Looks like
I'm not alone anymore.

35:15.380 --> 35:18.115
Henry.

35:18.117 --> 35:21.084
You should've done this
the easy way.

35:21.086 --> 35:23.753
'Cause my curse is still coming.

35:23.755 --> 35:26.256
And the final battle
is going to be worse

35:26.258 --> 35:28.892
than you could possibly imagine.

35:33.297 --> 35:35.799
Emma. Emma.

35:35.801 --> 35:36.933
How did you do it?

35:36.935 --> 35:38.235
It was the song you gave me.

35:38.237 --> 35:40.237
What do you mean? What song?

35:40.239 --> 35:41.505
It doesn't matter.
It's not important.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.240
What matters is
you were with me.

35:43.242 --> 35:45.642
You were with me my whole life!

35:45.644 --> 35:48.411
Swan.

35:48.413 --> 35:50.180
Killian!

37:03.988 --> 37:06.156
Are you ready
to recite your vows?

37:08.359 --> 37:11.695
Emma, when we met,
there was just one thing

37:11.697 --> 37:14.497
that mattered to me...

37:14.499 --> 37:18.602
Getting my revenge.

37:18.604 --> 37:23.006
And you did something
that no one else ever could.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.908
You showed me that
a heart full of love

37:24.910 --> 37:29.446
was the most precious
treasure of all,

37:29.448 --> 37:34.784
and one that I don't
intend to lose.

37:34.786 --> 37:37.854
They say that a captain's heart
belongs to his ship.

37:42.026 --> 37:46.263
And with this ring,
it now belongs to you.

37:49.433 --> 37:56.573
Killian, I spent so much
of my life on my own.

37:56.575 --> 38:02.979
And then, Henry found me
and brought me to storybrooke,

38:02.981 --> 38:08.485
and helped me find
the rest of my family.

38:08.487 --> 38:15.458
But just because you learn
that you come from true love

38:15.460 --> 38:18.295
doesn't mean that you believe
that you'll ever find it.

38:22.900 --> 38:26.569
But thanks to you, now I have.

38:35.346 --> 38:41.151
Do you, Killian Jones,
take this woman to be your wife

38:41.153 --> 38:43.920
and to love her
for all eternity?

38:43.922 --> 38:45.755
I do.

38:45.757 --> 38:50.026
And do you, Emma swan,
take this man

38:50.028 --> 38:54.764
to be your husband
and love him for all eternity?

38:54.766 --> 38:57.367
I do.

38:57.369 --> 38:59.669
Then it is with great pleasure

38:59.671 --> 39:04.307
that I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.781
You did it, swan.

39:11.783 --> 39:14.017
You got your happy ending.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.719
That's not what this is.

39:15.721 --> 39:17.687
It's something else.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.523
What, then?

39:20.525 --> 39:22.859
Happy beginning.

41:57.147 --> 42:00.049
The black fairy's curse!

42:00.051 --> 42:02.952
It's here!

42:10.528 --> 42:12.028
Where do you think
its taking us?

42:12.030 --> 42:13.630
It doesn't matter.

42:13.632 --> 42:17.033
Wherever we end up,
we're gonna win.

43:05.516 --> 43:06.583
Do you trust me?

43:06.585 --> 43:09.052
